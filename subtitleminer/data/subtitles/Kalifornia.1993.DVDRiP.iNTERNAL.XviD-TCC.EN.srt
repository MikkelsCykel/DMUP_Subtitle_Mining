1
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,997
Thanks.

2
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,869
- Is it OK if I smoke?
- Sure.

3
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,037
My matches are all wet. You got a lighter?

4
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,550
Yeah. It's here somewhere.
It's my wife's car.

5
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,238
There we are.

6
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,120
<i>I remember going on a school trip</i>
<i>to the top of the Empire State Building.</i>

7
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:22,720
<i>When I looked down at the people</i>
<i>on the street, they looked like ants.</i>

8
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,594
<i>I pulled out a penny. Some of us started</i>
<i>talking about what would happen</i>

9
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,315
<i>if I dropped it from up there</i>
<i>and it landed on somebody's head.</i>

10
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,558
<i>Of course I never crossed that line</i>
<i>and actually dropped the penny.</i>

11
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,434
<i>I don't think Early Grayce</i>
<i>even knew there was a line to cross.</i>

12
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,317
I mean the mind of a serial killer
as it relates to culpability.

13
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,955
Someone who can't distinguish
between right and wrong is like a child.

14
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,392
In law, he should be treated like a child.
He should not be in prison, or executed.

15
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,795
There you go again.

16
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,310
Next comes the part where
you blame misfiring synapses,

17
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,874
amok biochemicals
and horrendous childhoods.

18
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,754
It's a fact. Most of these people
have severe chemical brain imbalances.

19
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,668
Think I put enough tequila in?
The answer is research and treatment

20
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,872
under hospital conditions.
Not the electric chair.

21
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,232
That's great, Brian. Unless it's your
mother's head they find in the refrigerator.

22
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,272
But executing the killer
would not bring my mother back.

23
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,868
- Thank God.
- Oh, everybody's a joker.

24
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,956
But it'd sure make you feel a lot better.

25
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,640
No, actually it wouldn't
make me feel any better.

26
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,078
Brian, the bottom line is
these people are evil, plain and simple.

27
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,158
How 'bout a bowl of chilli? A hot one.

28
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,355
Be right there!

29
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,789
Antichrist would be a woman

30
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:03,948
in a man's body,
with seven heads and seven tails.

31
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,036
Make that to go.

32
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,759
Antichrist would be a woman

33
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,837
in a man's body.

34
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,794
Seven heads and seven tails.

35
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:23,389
Antichrist would be a woman

36
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,795
in a man's body.

37
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:30,755
Seven heads and seven tails.

38
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,153
Yeah!

39
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,636
<i>I always knew I'd be a writer,</i>

40
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:42,912
<i>but there's a big difference between</i>
<i>writing a magazine article and a book.</i>

41
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,679
<i>I know. I wrote a magazine article.</i>

42
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,350
<i>Everything I ever wanted to know about</i>
<i>serial killers fit nicely on the four pages.</i>

43
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,234
Brian, what are we doing here?

44
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:01,354
Research. Come on, look at this place.
You'll get some great photos in here.

45
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,755
This is where her nightmares began.

46
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,437
Her father worked the night shift here.
Most nights, he'd take her with him.

47
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,316
She was 11 years old.

48
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,395
Of course, the bastard knew
that nobody could hear her screams

49
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,988
over the noise of the machines.

50
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,115
<i>The article got me a book deal.</i>
<i>A little cash upfront.</i>

51
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:41,074
<i>But, between the rent and the convertible,</i>
<i>the advance was gone.</i>

52
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,714
<i>I owed a book and I was stuck.</i>

53
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,436
<i>What little I knew about serial killers</i>
<i>I'd learned in a university library.</i>

54
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:54,396
<i>The only thing I knew for certain was that</i>
<i>people didn't kill each other in libraries.</i>

55
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,720
She murdered her first victim over here.

56
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,438
They found him stuffed in the corner.

57
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,951
They found her second victim over there.

58
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:12,956
Can you imagine the rage and pain
she must have felt returning to this place?

59
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,672
The victim returns
to the scene of the crime

60
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,596
and becomes the criminal.

61
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,076
Where did everybody go?

62
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,476
I didn't take that long.

63
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,276
Size seven.

64
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,068
That's right, ain't it? Super size seven.

65
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,556
Oh, Early, you're a specialist.

66
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:08,991
- Happy birthday, Adele.
- Thank you, honey. These are beautiful.

67
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:14,797
This reminds me of Cinderella when
the prince gave her his glass slipper.

68
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:18,674
Except these ones are red
and they ain't see-through.

69
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,268
And there's two of 'em. Is that my chilli?

70
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,996
Oh, honey.

71
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,553
Happy birthday to me. Thank you.

72
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,070
Tonight turned out to be interesting, uh?

73
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:40,751
Those fascinating friends of yours
and their stimulating conversation?

74
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,792
No, the warehouse. I'm not that stoned.

75
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:47,435
Oh, the warehouse.
Actually, yeah, it was pretty interesting.

76
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,518
It was definitely the highlight
of the evening.

77
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:59,518
You know, just bein' there where it
all really happened. I could almost...

78
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,476
Take your shirt off.

79
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,876
Yes, ma'am.

80
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,676
Come here.

81
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,238
Early!

82
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,798
What?

83
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,388
I'll be waitin' for you when you get back.

84
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,469
Put your titty back up, Adele.

85
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,151
Oh, wait, I forgot.
Mr. Diebold stopped by yesterday.

86
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,393
He said if we don't pay him
by the end of the month,

87
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,353
he's gonna kick us
the F-U-C-K outta here.

88
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,948
He said that to you? Cussed at you?

89
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,036
- You gonna talk to him?
- Well...

90
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,116
Shut up!

91
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,678
If he comes back here,
don't you open that door.

92
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,040
Suppose he hears me inside?

93
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,951
I picked up some Chinese.
Did you hear from the gallery?

94
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,516
Have you got your slides back?

95
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,756
What'd they say?

96
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,994
Oh, well, you know.
Same story, different day.

97
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,751
They're idiots.

98
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,279
Too graphic. Too overt.

99
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,113
Not suitable for mass consumption.
I forget what...

100
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,710
You don't wanna be suitable
for mass consumption.

101
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,796
I know.

102
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,310
It's just...

103
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,396
Who cares anyway, right?

104
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,392
Not me.

105
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,635
Christ, I'm dying here, Brian.

106
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:02,469
Why can't we get out of here?
Why can't we just get the hell out of here?

107
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,239
Why can't we just go to California?
Why not?

108
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,512
- Just like that?
- Yeah. Just like that.

109
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,036
<i>What the hell did I know about California?</i>

110
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,869
<i>For some people, it was still</i>
<i>a place of hopes and dreams.</i>

111
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,956
<i>A chance to start over.</i>

112
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,435
<i>The idea was, if you could just get there,</i>
<i>everything would be OK.</i>

113
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:36,509
<i>And if it wasn't OK there, well, then it</i>
<i>probably wasn't gonna be OK anywhere.</i>

114
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,796
Adele! Whose car is that out front?

115
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,876
She's not here.

116
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,070
Shit.

117
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,350
Well, look who stopped by.

118
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:01,632
And I ain't supposed to be at the parole
office till tomorrow. Two o'clock.

119
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,469
You know, Early, you're supposed
to notify me when you lose your job.

120
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,556
Yep.

121
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,439
I stopped by the mirror factory today.

122
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,955
- You left quite a mess behind there.
- That wasn't my fault.

123
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,912
It's dangerous there
and they treat me like shit.

124
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:27,555
Nobody ever has treated you right,
have they, Early?

125
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,038
Your daddy was pickin' on you
when he threw you outta the house

126
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,948
for stealin' the tyres off his truck.

127
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,192
The police were way outta line when they

128
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,915
kept you from beatin'
that bartender half to death.

129
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:48,800
You know, Early, I bet the Lord's gonna
be pickin' on you come Judgment Day.

130
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:52,435
Now, hold on there.
I ain't got nothin' against God, see?

131
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,755
It's just the people he let get in there.

132
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,236
What you lookin' for?

133
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:05,230
That girlfriend of yours.
Not much for housekeepin', is she?

134
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,430
Well, we's thinkin'
about movin', anyhows.

135
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,996
Maybe down to Texas.
Get me a job in one of them offshore rigs.

136
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,156
What are you talkin' about?

137
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,792
Well...

138
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,196
- You know you can't leave the state.
- Yeah, it's just...

139
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,880
What you can do is get a job.

140
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:29,108
You be at this address.
Three o'clock sharp.

141
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,076
What is it?

142
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,276
Janitor's job.

143
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,789
Well, don't wanna be no janitor.

144
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:45,154
I don't give two shits
what you want and what you don't want.

145
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:50,150
I'm tellin' you to be there. Or you
gonna be havin' dinner with the sheriff.

146
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,998
You understand me, boy?

147
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,079
You oughta try puttin' a bag
over your head for that cough.

148
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,395
Works every time.

149
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,156
Peg-armed piece of shit.

150
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,710
<i>She came back to the warehouse</i>
<i>that her father molested her in.</i>

151
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:18,230
<i>Why? Because this place is the catalyst.</i>

152
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,511
<i>She needed to relive her own nightmares</i>
<i>before she could kill those men.</i>

153
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,236
How are you, Sleeping Beauty?

154
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,799
- I didn't have the heart to wake you.
- Thanks.

155
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,876
My head.

156
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,558
- What are you doin'?
- I sat down with your photos,

157
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,796
- which are wonderful...
- Thank you.

158
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,275
..and my tapes, and I started writing.

159
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,073
- How's it goin'?
- It's the best stuff I've ever done.

160
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,476
- And I think I know why.
- Why?

161
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,878
Because, for the first time, I understood
that woman as a human being.

162
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,919
I was walking where she walked,
where she killed.

163
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,235
I was in her skin,
looking through her eyes.

164
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,631
I think we got a book here,
with your pictures and my writing.

165
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,957
- It's a book.
- A book on the warehouse murders?

166
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:07,152
No, on some of the most infamous
murders in American history.

167
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,874
I wanna go to where they lived
and where they killed.

168
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,560
I want you to take the pictures.
I'll write the text.

169
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,679
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about this.

170
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,795
We can go through Tennessee.

171
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,473
We could drop through Arkansas...
wherever the hell Arkansas is.

172
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,956
There it is.
Then we can drop down into Texas,

173
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,719
and from there
it's a straight shot right into...

174
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,319
California.

175
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,398
We don't stop till
we hit the fucking ocean.

176
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,159
Thank you.

177
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:41,353
We don't have enough money,
but we'll figure something out, right?

178
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,589
- Hold on a minute there, boy.
- Shit!

179
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,315
Goddammit, you're gonna
settle that rent here and now.

180
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,189
I'm tired of your bullshit, boy.
I want my money!

181
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,117
Dipshit.

182
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,478
You son of a bitch. Come back here!

183
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:55,400
That's it. Tell him I want you both the fuck
outta here by Sunday or I'll call the police.

184
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,109
Elvis, get the fuck off of him.

185
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,555
<i>The ride share was my idea.</i>

186
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,877
<i>I thought if we found somebody</i>
<i>who wanted to go to California,</i>

187
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,468
<i>they'd help pay for the gas.</i>

188
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,114
<i>Carrie wasn't crazy about the idea,</i>

189
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,312
<i>but the Lincoln only</i>
<i>got eight miles a gallon.</i>

190
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:32,593
- They say one day the whole thing...
- Is gonna slide right in the ocean.

191
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,518
''Need somebody to share turns
at the wheel and expenses

192
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,633
on a week-long, cross-country
tour of historic murder sites''?

193
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,356
You've gotta be kidding.

194
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,948
Who in their right mind
is gonna want to do that?

195
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,355
- I would.
- Like I said...

196
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,436
Hey, good luck on that thesis.

197
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,717
Don't know where
the personal office is at, do you?

198
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:00,037
Personnel office is...
first door on the left.

199
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,469
What, down there?

200
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,556
Stinking bitch.

201
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,636
Shit.

202
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,316
Early!

203
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,552
- How ya doin', momma?
- Fine.

204
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,797
Boy, I'm tired. Dinner ready yet?

205
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,115
Almost.

206
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,196
Well, let me know.

207
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,270
- Early.
- Yeah?

208
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:48,268
- Will you tell me more about California?
- Yeah, I guess so.

209
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,956
Let's see.

210
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:56,313
One thing, people think faster out there
on account of all that warm weather.

211
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,159
Cold weather make people stupid,
that's a fact.

212
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,477
That explains why there's
so many stupid people round here.

213
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,398
It sure does. You know what else?

214
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,868
You never have to buy no fruit
on account it's all on the trees.

215
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,472
And they ain't got no speed limits.

216
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,592
I hear your first month's rent
is free - state law.

217
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,431
So till we get settled, we'll just
move around from month to month.

218
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,551
How'd that be with you, momma?

219
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,749
What are we gonna do out there, Early?

220
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:31,350
The first thing is get us a couple of
six-packs of Lucky Lager

221
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:35,678
and climb up to that famous Hollywood
sign. We're gonna howl at the moon.

222
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,676
Yeah, just like that.

223
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,718
I heard once that there
ain't nothin' on that ol' moon

224
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:49,277
except some little golf balls
the astronauts left behind.

225
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:53,109
Nah, that ain't right. That's bullshit.

226
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,990
The government be sendin' people there
all the time. Just don't want us to know.

227
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,315
Now, git.

228
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,034
Well, let me know when you're finished.

229
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,996
Shit!

230
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,315
So what'd he sound like over the phone?

231
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,432
He was real polite.
He kept calling me ''sir''.

232
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,596
- I like that.
- Yeah, I'll bet you do.

233
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,711
You should try it once in a while.

234
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,879
I don't know. This is really weird.
We should have at least met them first.

235
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,630
Beggars can't be choosers. They were the
only ones to answer the ride-share note.

236
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:56,514
Oh, God. Please don't let them
be as boring as Brian's friends.

237
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,790
Anything but that.

238
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,515
Early, we shouldn't be doin' this.

239
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:13,030
You know you ain't even allowed
to be leaving the state.

240
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,270
And these people are strangers.

241
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,916
What kind of people would stop at places
where other people got murdered?

242
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:24,279
What if these people
are dangerous, Early?

243
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,313
- They ain't dangerous, they're writers.
- Honey... Early Grayce!

244
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:33,795
- Did you settle things with Mr. Diebold?
- Yeah, I did.

245
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,876
I left him with the car.

246
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,074
We're all straight now.

247
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,475
- What is that?
- That's Lucy.

248
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:48,112
Adele, what kind of cuckoo-brain
carries a cactus in her purse?

249
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,149
I don't know.

250
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,036
Straighten up.

251
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,632
Oh, Brian. You've got to be kidding me.
They look like Okies.

252
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,115
Oh, Jesus, they look kinda weird.

253
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,596
- They can't have $5 between them.
- Smile. Let me do the talkin'.

254
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,551
- Let's keep goin'.
- Lighten up.

255
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:12,592
- How many times you gonna say that?
- As many times as it takes.

256
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,676
Lighten up.

257
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,276
- Early?
- Mr. Kessler?

258
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,637
Hi, I'm Brian Kessler. Nice to meet you.

259
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,398
- You must be Adele.
- Yeah.

260
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,351
- That's Adele.
- Nice to meet you.

261
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,436
Hi.

262
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:38,279
- Can I help you with your luggage?
- Oh, yeah.

263
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,076
- I'll get these.
- OK.

264
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:53,717
- Hi, I'm Adele.
- Hi, I'm Carrie.

265
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,990
- Oh, I like your hair.
- Oh. Thanks.

266
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,036
Cos it... it's short.

267
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,879
Oh, yeah. Well... Thanks.

268
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,358
<i>Carrie was right. If you looked in</i>
<i>the dictionary under ''poor white trash'',</i>

269
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,233
<i>a picture of Early and Adele</i>
<i>would have been there.</i>

270
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,476
<i>But I knew if I was gonna</i>
<i>be a good writer,</i>

271
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,556
<i>I'd have to ignore the clichés</i>

272
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:30,319
<i>and look at life through my own eyes.</i>

273
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,596
- So, Early.
- Yep.

274
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:38,316
- What do you do?
- Well, I do some work at the...

275
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,954
Well, I did some work
at the mirror factory.

276
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:44,709
Know what, Brian? One night
when we was stayin' up late,

277
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,479
we was talkin' about
how much bad luck

278
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,398
he must have coming
from all those mirrors he broke.

279
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:57,232
And I swear we came to 449 years that
it would take for him to work it all off.

280
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,271
And he'd have to - after he died,

281
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:04,235
he's gonna have to keep comin' back
to earth over and over and over again.

282
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,710
Karma.

283
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,308
- What?
- Karma.

284
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,034
You know, when you do
something bad to someone,

285
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:17,472
and fate pays you back
by something bad happening to you?

286
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,592
Is that French?

287
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,792
We could stop somewhere
if you haven't had breakfast.

288
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:28,117
It's like this, Brian. I don't eat breakfast.

289
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,676
It's because of what
he read in this book once, Brian.

290
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:35,634
That folks needin' breakfast
is a myth or somethin',

291
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,479
and it was put out by the cereal people.

292
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,038
- Jesus Christ!
- Who are you?

293
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,798
His parole officer.

294
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,036
Oh, right. Talked to you on the phone.

295
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:04,750
- What the hell happened?
- They say it's a torch job.

296
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,594
- That sound like your boy?
- Yeah, could be.

297
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,751
- Where would I find him?
- I don't know.

298
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:13,316
Crazy son of a bitch was talkin' about
movin' down to Texas.

299
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,431
Without his car?

300
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:19,719
What about the owner of the house,
this... Mr. John Diebold?

301
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,638
- You know where he might be at?
- I don't know.

302
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:27,390
I tell you what. He's not gonna be
too happy when he sees this.

303
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,078
Jesus Christ!

304
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,795
<i>Early seemed harmless.</i>
<i>Primitive, but harmless.</i>

305
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:44,595
<i>The fact was that he'd killed his landlord</i>
<i>less than an hour before we met him.</i>

306
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,836
<i>He was even wearing the guy's ring.</i>

307
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,075
<i>Who knows what he did with the finger?</i>

308
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,637
Here you go, momma.

309
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,395
- Oh, thank you, honey.
- Yeah.

310
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,431
Look what I got! I got a camera.

311
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,680
Who gets the water?

312
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,876
Here you go, Bri.
I got chips and some jerky here.

313
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,150
If you want 'em, just holler.

314
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,672
Just in case.

315
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,115
<i>From the moment I began</i>
<i>working on the book,</i>

316
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:36,471
<i>I found myself asking</i>
<i>one question over and over.</i>

317
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:40,639
<i>What's the difference</i>
<i>between a killer and any one of us?</i>

318
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,638
<i>What was it they had - or didn't have -</i>

319
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,433
<i>that separated them from us?</i>

320
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,790
The Novaks are long gone.

321
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,878
But the white picket fence
they hired Michael Zeruba to put up

322
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,992
is still here.

323
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,675
- The Novaks...
- Hey, you two.

324
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,630
Come on, show your love.

325
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:38,229
The Novaks embraced the young drifter
as one of their own.

326
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,871
The neighbours said
he was a quiet young man

327
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,879
who was often seen pushing
the children on the swing set.

328
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,789
Everything was fine until the day
the Novaks ran out of work for Michael

329
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,388
and had to ask him to leave.

330
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:59,709
How does a man get to the point where
he can kill a human being in cold blood?

331
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,798
Early, could you move
out of the way, please?

332
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:12,517
The first to die
was the nine-year-old daughter.

333
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:22,079
Hi, I'm Brian Kessler. What's your name?

334
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,312
Pa!

335
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,436
Pa, where are you?

336
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:38,833
Pa! There's somebody at the door
who wants to see you.

337
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,879
- What? Who is it?
- I don't know.

338
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,231
Afternoon, sir. I'm sorry to wake you.

339
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,316
My name is Brian Kessler.

340
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,790
I'm a writer.

341
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:55,710
I'm workin' on a book on some of
the famous murders in American history.

342
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,479
I'm sure you're aware
that this is the Novak farm.

343
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:03,478
I was wondering if my girlfriend Carrie
could come in and take a few pictures?

344
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,799
I'll walk around, tape some notes and
we'll be out of your hair in five minutes.

345
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:11,350
I'd like to maybe just walk around
the house and get a feel for it.

346
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,198
Goddamn ghouls.

347
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,559
We drove all day to get here, sir.
I'd be out of your hair in five minutes, sir.

348
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,796
Five minutes.

349
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,716
Brian, come on.

350
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,196
Let's forget about it. Come on.

351
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:37,115
<i>At the time, I was angry that</i>
<i>Mr. Baxter slammed the door in my face.</i>

352
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,390
<i>But it was just his way of forgetting,</i>

353
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:43,559
<i>of pretending that nothing terrible</i>
<i>had ever happened there.</i>

354
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:47,753
<i>I guess it's only natural to try</i>
<i>and forget the bad things that happen.</i>

355
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,836
<i>You never really do, though.</i>

356
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,556
We've come 480 miles so far.

357
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,672
- Not bad for a day's haul, huh?
- Pretty good.

358
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,479
You got any family or friends
in California, Early?

359
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:23,990
- No. Do you? You do?
- No, I don't.

360
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,789
Do you have any friends or family
in California, Carrie?

361
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,354
What? No.

362
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:38,076
Well, that's OK.
At least we all got each other, right?

363
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,952
I mean, that's somethin'.

364
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,829
My momma used to say that
when you have people around you,

365
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,716
it's better that you're not by yourself,
because when you're alone

366
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,956
it's hard to develop your personality.

367
00:30:56,280 --> 00:31:01,229
With more people around you, it helps,
cos friends are really important and...

368
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,751
- Thank you.
- Thanks, bro.

369
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,758
We'll get the next one.
We gotta hit the sack.

370
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:10,270
Let's go, momma.

371
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,309
- Have sweet dreams.
- Night, Adele.

372
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,436
Night, Early.

373
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:26,194
That's funny.
I didn't know you were so prejudiced.

374
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,278
Because I object to having
somebody take off their shoe

375
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:33,439
and scratch their foot
while I'm eating... I'm prejudiced?

376
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:36,950
He can't help the way he was raised.
I kinda feel sorry for him.

377
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,908
You feel sorry for him. That's so sweet.

378
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:45,112
Obviously you didn't get
a whiff of that sock.

379
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,075
Bitch, bitch, bitch.

380
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:56,319
30 bucks for a motel. For what?

381
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,758
A lumpy mattress, a crummy TV
and a crapper? Don't think so.

382
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:05,391
- Honey, sing me a song.
- I'm busy, momma. Just stay put.

383
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,596
Please?

384
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:12,555
OK, if you don't sing it,
I'm gonna sing it myself.

385
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:19,032
# Do your balls hang low?
Do they wobble to and fro?

386
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:22,232
# Can you tie 'em in a knot?
Can you tie 'em in a bow?

387
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:25,830
# And put 'em over your shoulder
Like a continental soldier?

388
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:29,873
# Do your balls hang low?
Do your balls hang low?

389
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:35,629
Honey, when we get to California, will
you take me to that Chinese restaurant

390
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,558
where all them footprints are out in front?

391
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:42,192
Only if they let me put mine down, too.

392
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,079
Pretty smooth how they stiffed us
on dinner, though.

393
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:55,036
He didn't stiff us.
He paid for the gas, remember?

394
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:00,438
Brian, I am telling you
they're almost broke

395
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:03,632
and we are gonna end up
paying for the two of them.

396
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,076
Don't change the subject.

397
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,394
It is my favourite subject, though.

398
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,671
- Morning.
- Morning, Early.

399
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:58,275
- Breakfast?
- No, I don't eat breakfast. Never do.

400
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:03,793
Sir? We don't have a liquor licence,
so I'm afraid you're gonna have to...

401
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,629
That's OK. I got plenty more
where this 'un come from.

402
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,354
- Morning.
- Morning, Adele.

403
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,870
You cut your hair.

404
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,754
Early cut it.
He said it makes me look more pretty.

405
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,676
And I think he's right

406
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,109
cos... he's right.

407
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,795
Nice job, Early.

408
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,388
You like to order some breakfast?

409
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:55,399
No, I won't be having breakfast
this mornin', thank you.

410
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,519
Want some of this?

411
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,433
- Finish.
- Thanks.

412
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,835
What you readin'?

413
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:09,953
<i>- Sex, Art, and American Culture.</i>
- No, I never read that.

414
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:13,470
I can't wait to get on the road.
I love that convertible.

415
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,394
- Yeah, it's great.
- Cos...

416
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,955
I like wind, Brian.

417
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,556
So do I.

418
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:00,913
- You want me to get your stuff?
- No. Thanks, Early, I can manage.

419
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,758
I meant to say luggage. Ma'am.

420
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,677
I got 'em.

421
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,269
- Hi, honey.
- Momma.

422
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:57,672
<i>When you dream, there are no rules.</i>

423
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,831
<i>People can fly. Anything can happen.</i>

424
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:06,789
<i>Sometimes there's a moment</i>
<i>as you're waking</i>

425
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:10,071
<i>and you become aware</i>
<i>of the real world around you,</i>

426
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,191
<i>but you're still dreaming.</i>

427
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,392
<i>You may think you can fly,</i>
<i>but you better not try it.</i>

428
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:20,590
<i>Serial killers live</i>
<i>their whole lives in that place,</i>

429
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,638
<i>somewhere between dreams and reality.</i>

430
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,716
Guess it's your turn to pay, Early.

431
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,713
Hey, move it.

432
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,036
Stupid son of a bitch.

433
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:32,555
You know, I used to smoke
before I met Early.

434
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,636
But he broke me of that.

435
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,118
- Broke you?
- Oh. Yeah.

436
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:43,711
Cos Early, he don't think that women
should smoke or drink or cuss.

437
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,956
So you know what I do?

438
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,594
I spell all my cuss words.

439
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,159
S...

440
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,350
S-H...

441
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,558
S-H-I-T!

442
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:42,600
But you don't do
any of those other things?

443
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:46,517
No. I mean, I better not.

444
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:25,116
- He whips you?
- No, no, no. Only when I deserve it.

445
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:10,632
- You were in there a long time.
- Yeah, I took a dump.

446
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:13,194
You don't wanna go in there.
Wall-to-wall stink.

447
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:17,029
- Just goin' in to wash my hands.
- Ain't got no sink.

448
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:20,072
- No sink?
- No. Damnedest thing I ever seen.

449
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,076
Let's go.

450
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,876
How 'bout I drive, bud?

451
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:42,357
- No, momma. Get in the back.
- $28.35, sir.

452
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,630
- How much?
- $28.35.

453
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:47,194
There. Hope I got that.

454
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,196
Make it an even 30.

455
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,276
- Thank you, sir.
- Yeah.

456
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:17,595
<i>When you first meet people, all you notice</i>
<i>is the differences between you and them.</i>

457
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:21,269
<i>But, as time passes,</i>
<i>you start noticing the similarities.</i>

458
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:24,315
<i>I guess that's how all friendships begin.</i>

459
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:29,036
OK, so you first. You put down
a card, and then I put down a card.

460
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:32,789
Then when they match up
and it's the same card,

461
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:35,150
then you go ''snap'' and I take it.

462
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,875
And I take the cards
that's there and... like that.

463
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,710
Snap.

464
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:49,877
I thought you said
you never played this before.

465
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,118
I haven't. I really haven't.
I'm a fast learner, I guess.

466
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:58,638
I was reading in your deal there how
they never caught that Black Dolly killer.

467
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:00,318
- Black Dahlia.
- Yeah.

468
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:03,671
- They didn't.
- Well, I was wonderin' how come.

469
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:07,031
See what I'm gettin' at? It's like ''Hmm.”

470
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:12,314
Well, some people think he just stopped
killing and disappeared back into society.

471
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:17,355
That's fine and dandy, but I wanna know
what a smart fella like yourself thinks.

472
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,630
I always thought
it was the work of a serial killer.

473
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:23,116
Anybody who took that much care
bisecting another human being...

474
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:25,515
- Bisecting?
- He cut 'em in two.

475
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:28,677
- He hacked 'em up?
- In two pieces, yeah. In half.

476
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,870
Anybody who did that
must have enjoyed it.

477
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:35,596
He would have done it again and again
and again until somebody stopped him.

478
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:38,880
That's good. That's a good theory, Bri.

479
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:43,796
You wanna hear mine?

480
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:48,352
- Sure.
- OK.

481
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:51,870
Ain't you gonna record it?

482
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:00,554
Early Grayce's Black Dahlia theory.

483
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:02,636
June 23rd.

484
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:06,677
OK. Now, I'm bettin' he's still alive.

485
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:11,556
Real old, livin' in a trailer park
or somethin', somewheres.

486
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,636
But he's alive, see.

487
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:18,679
Now, he's thinkin' about what he done,

488
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:22,190
goin' over it and over it and over it
in his head, every night,

489
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:24,788
thinkin' how smart he is
for gettin' away with it.

490
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:27,753
- That's possible.
- You shoot pool?

491
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,516
Come on, bud.

492
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,874
Designated driver.

493
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,956
Minnesota Fats.

494
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:51,198
- Don't forget your key.
- Why'd I open my big mouth?

495
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,468
Please come home soon.

496
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,956
Let's go!

497
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:04,032
Jesus, bud,
you damn near swallowed her!

498
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:15,390
So why didn't you go with them, Adele?

499
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:22,709
Cos, you know how Early feels
about women drinkin'.

500
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:27,915
So how did you and Early
meet, anyways?

501
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,470
I was hitchhikin' this one day.

502
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:35,273
And Early stopped.

503
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:39,029
And I walked up to look in the window.

504
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:45,554
And I looked in, and Early's face,
he was down like that cos he was serious.

505
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:49,116
And then he said ''You gettin' in?”

506
00:46:56,320 --> 00:47:00,518
And then he looked up
and that's when I saw his eyes.

507
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:04,553
And I swear, Carrie,
he has the eyes of an angel.

508
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:10,995
And then, I ended up
movin' in his trailer with him,

509
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:13,236
cos I thought it'd be kinda neat.

510
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:16,476
But...

511
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:24,274
Know what? I was thinkin' that
what if me, you and Brian and Early

512
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:27,710
all moved into a house
together in California?

513
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:29,796
Wouldn't that be fun?

514
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,596
Well, I mean...

515
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:37,358
Well, we'll see what happens.

516
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:40,875
- You never know.
- OK.

517
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,275
Do you want me to fix your hair for you?

518
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,956
Yes.

519
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:02,391
Cos... I don't really like it. That much.

520
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:05,796
Come on, then.

521
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:10,793
- OK.
- It doesn't look that bad, but...

522
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:13,556
I think we should fix it.

523
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:23,589
I'm bettin' we gonna find us
some doors round here.

524
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:27,793
- Yeah, the door's out front, on the street.
- Not doors.

525
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,876
Not doors, bud.

526
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:34,034
Openings to other dimensions.

527
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:39,198
See - I read, bud.

528
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:42,790
And I'm tellin' you,
if a man knows what he's doin',

529
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:46,754
he can transport himself to
anywhere in this goddamn universe.

530
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,474
Didn't know that, did you?

531
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:53,718
No, I didn't. Think I should tell you
I'm not much of a pool player.

532
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:56,832
Oh, it ain't hard. I can teach you.

533
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:58,953
- Really?
- Yeah.

534
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:01,315
I'll spot you a few balls.

535
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:04,432
- You're not gonna hustle me, are you?
- How much money you got?

536
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,996
What's that?

537
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:16,232
That's a portfolio of my work.
That's what that is.

538
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:20,396
Your pictures? Can I look at 'em?

539
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,150
Yup, go right ahead.

540
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:30,916
Oh, my Lord!

541
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:37,717
- Did you take this one?
- I took all of those.

542
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,878
- That one's me.
- No, it isn't.

543
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:47,030
- Hold still, you.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

544
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:52,351
My God, Carrie.

545
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:57,270
If Early ever saw me in a picture like that,
I'd be black-and-blue for a week.

546
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:05,875
You shouldn't let him do that to you.

547
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:14,636
You think Early's mean to me?

548
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:20,996
Well, he's not.

549
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:25,599
He may punish me once in a while, but...

550
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:29,196
he's not mean.

551
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:37,234
When I was 1 3...

552
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:42,795
there were these three boys.

553
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:46,199
They raped me in the back of this truck.

554
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:57,113
They hurt me so bad,

555
00:50:57,240 --> 00:51:00,198
I was in the hospital for,
like, four months.

556
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:07,034
And I feel safe with Early, cos

557
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:09,799
most of the time he treats me really nice.

558
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,630
I know that he'd never...

559
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:20,230
He would never let anything like that
ever happen to me again.

560
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:30,079
I like my hair.
You did a really good job, Carrie.

561
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:34,756
It's really professional.

562
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:43,432
Hey, Marlene! Come here, baby.

563
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:47,354
Why don't you and me get together
tonight and sweat it up some?

564
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,471
Fuck off, TJ.

565
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:00,955
There you go. That'll be five bucks.

566
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:07,875
Wait. Wait a minute.
These aren't Lucky Lager.

567
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,833
- We ordered Lucky Lager.
- Take a look around you.

568
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:14,470
If you see somethin' lucky around here,
you let me know.

569
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:21,918
Why don't you tell me
what you think is so funny?

570
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:25,160
- What?
- Do you think I'm funny?

571
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:26,190
No.

572
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:29,392
What would a jizz-garglin',
cum-drunk fairy like you

573
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:32,239
do with a pretty girl like that, anyway?

574
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:36,069
- What are you talkin' about, man? Relax.
- Hit him, Bri, cos it's comin'.

575
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:41,513
- What was that? Is this your boyfriend?
- No, he's not my boyfriend. Just cool it.

576
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:44,115
- Hey, asshole.
- This ain't Lucky Lager.

577
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:56,149
Break it up!

578
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:58,874
It wasn't that guy's fault. TJ started it.

579
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:11,356
Dipshit.

580
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:19,152
Rack 'em up.

581
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:23,359
# Cos your pink replaces your red

582
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:28,791
- My mom was a beautician.
- Really?

583
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:31,195
Yeah. She likes pink a lot.

584
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:35,350
You should have seen her face.

585
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:39,792
She was mad when she first
found out I was with Early,

586
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:43,390
on account of him
just gettin' out of jail an' all.

587
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:48,039
She hasn't talked to me
in over a year now.

588
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:51,195
I wish she'd call me, Carrie.

589
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:53,276
Early's been in jail?

590
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:04,076
What for?

591
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:07,036
For carryin' a gun.

592
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:12,154
And resistin' arrest.

593
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,798
It's a really interesting story, actually.

594
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:19,799
He put up a fight with the policeman

595
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:23,629
and they struggled because
he didn't wanna be arrested.

596
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,436
I'd have done the same thing.

597
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:30,678
Why aren't you laughin' now?

598
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:34,872
I don't know. I just don't think that

599
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,197
carrying guns and resisting
arrest is very funny.

600
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:52,751
Well... I'm gonna go back
to my hotel room now, Carrie.

601
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:01,796
I had a really great time with you.

602
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:06,873
I just think I had too many beers.

603
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:13,514
And I wasn't even supposed
to be drinkin' in the first place!

604
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:16,359
Adele, you don't have to go.
I didn't mean...

605
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:24,793
Great.

606
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:27,430
Look at this dipshit.

607
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:30,875
Hey, watch it, asshole!

608
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:34,352
Get him, Bri. Tear him up.

609
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:36,436
Oh, I gotta see a man about a mule.

610
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:39,951
What?

611
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:42,036
Take a piss.

612
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:46,872
Hey, see if there's any reebs
in the back seat.

613
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,833
- What?
- Reebs. Beers.

614
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:53,639
It's what we used to call 'em
when we were kids.

615
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:56,631
It's beer spelt backwards.

616
00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:00,309
Shit! Think I chipped the concrete, Bri.

617
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:02,590
The last one. I want you to have it

618
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:04,950
- for saving my ass.
- Don't want it. Take it.

619
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:08,197
It ain't nothin'. I picked
that big Yankee mother years ago.

620
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:10,470
But I'm not a mother and you are.

621
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,956
Come on!

622
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:16,836
Thank you.

623
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:22,150
How long you had your woman, bud?

624
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:24,510
- Three years.
- Yeah? She's a good one.

625
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:27,200
She's a breeder, you dog.

626
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:31,916
I'll tell her you said she's a breeder.
She'll like that. I'll tell her you said that.

627
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:33,996
Can I get that, bud?

628
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:48,432
Do you remember them doors?
Them doors I was talkin' about, Bri?

629
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:56,348
I got me a couple.
I found me a couple of 'em in Kentucky.

630
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:00,278
Hell, I wasn't even lookin'
for the first 'un.

631
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:04,274
I was on the side of the road
swingin' my sickle.

632
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:11,354
I turn around and there's this door.
This big ol' door.

633
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:16,156
And light's comin' out,
blinding me, real gold.

634
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:18,236
And I'm thinkin', this can't be.

635
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:20,715
So, I close my eyes.

636
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:23,952
And I count one,
I count two, I count three,

637
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:26,036
I count four, five.

638
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:28,476
And I open my eyes.

639
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:33,193
It wasn't there.

640
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:46,396
Come on.

641
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:01,910
Am I late?

642
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:03,996
Sorry.

643
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:08,719
Early and me,
we got into a fight in this bar.

644
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:11,117
I'm fine, though.

645
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:14,118
It was me and him against like, 30 guys.

646
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:17,397
You and I, we gotta talk
about your good buddy Early.

647
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,750
Who said he's my good buddy?

648
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:22,474
You sure been actin' like you were.

649
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:26,388
- Out whoopin' it up and drinkin'.
- You been drinkin', too. Come on.

650
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:28,352
Oh yeah, right.

651
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:32,473
You should have seen how scared
she was that he was gonna find out.

652
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:36,796
- He beats her, you know.
- How do you know that?

653
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:40,274
Because she told me.
That's how I know that.

654
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:44,836
I gotta see a man about a mule.

655
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:48,316
But only when she deserves it!

656
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:53,909
Do you happen to know
that he was in jail?

657
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:57,237
Yeah. For stealing a car.

658
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:01,554
Really? Is that what he told you?

659
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:03,875
He told her it was for carrying a gun.

660
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:07,599
Brian, it could be for murder
for all we know.

661
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:12,237
Will you stop being
so fucking melodramatic?

662
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:14,316
Melodramatic?

663
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:20,119
If it was murder... he'd still be in jail.

664
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:23,791
Or he'd be on parole.

665
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:27,708
In which case, he wouldn't
be allowed to leave the state.

666
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:32,833
Maybe he wasn't allowed to leave the
state. Ever stop to think about that?

667
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:39,119
OK, we'll get the keys, we'll get the
car and sneak out. Is that what you want?

668
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:43,677
- What is the matter with you?
- Can we talk about this in the morning?

669
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:50,400
So how are you feelin' now, Brian?

670
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:57,231
Does your stomach feel kinda like
it's in these knots and it's twisty

671
00:59:57,360 --> 01:00:00,352
and you could just explode
at any given moment?

672
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:02,748
Well...

673
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:06,714
My daddy, he used to make
this great drink for hangovers.

674
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:10,196
And he'd make a blend of
sauerkraut juice and Tabasco sauce...

675
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:12,276
Goddamn! You see that woman?

676
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:14,035
She's butt ugly.

677
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:19,280
And he'd put in a little bit of lemon.
For the tartness.

678
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:23,393
And then the last ingredient -
this is the best one - was an egg,

679
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:28,594
so that he could have breakfast and get
rid of his hangover all in the same time.

680
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:31,598
Shave that dog and teach it to hunt!

681
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:35,711
<i>Early lived in the moment.</i>

682
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:38,832
<i>He did whatever he wanted,</i>
<i>whenever he wanted.</i>

683
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:40,916
<i>It was that simple.</i>

684
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:46,070
<i>I don't know if I was fascinated</i>
<i>or frightened by him.</i>

685
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:48,236
<i>Probably both.</i>

686
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:51,835
OK. What shall I call you?

687
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:55,877
I can't call you Lucy. Lucy's gone.

688
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,831
I'll call you Shelly.

689
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:01,555
Hi, Shelly. I know you're thirsty.

690
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:08,029
What? What's goin' on?

691
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:09,593
- Look.
- What?

692
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:11,438
Look!

693
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:41,356
Only thing my ol' man ever gimme
was this goddamn .45.

694
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:45,471
Japanese, but it's pretty good.

695
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:47,795
- Go on, shoot it.
- No, I never did this.

696
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:50,309
- I don't know how to do it.
- Yeah, you can do it.

697
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:53,318
- I haven't...
- Point and shoot the damn thing.

698
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,719
No, bud, you're jerkin' it.
You're all like this.

699
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:03,356
You gotta hold it soft -
like your pecker. OK?

700
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:05,836
Boys'll be boys.

701
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,754
- You know any tricks, Carrie?
- No.

702
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:13,393
Now hold on. Hold on.

703
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:16,318
- You wanna learn some?
- No.

704
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:18,749
OK, loosen up. Loosen your elbow.

705
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:22,837
Breathe. You gotta breathe, bud.
Hold it.

706
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:24,518
Shoot.

707
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:27,196
- Hey, Carrie...
- Good one.

708
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:31,632
- You look good with a gun, Brian.
- Good one, bud. Super. Good one.

709
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:35,991
You like that gun? I'm gonna give
it to you. I want you to have it.

710
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:38,793
- I don't need a gun.
- No, go on. Take it.

711
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:40,876
I'll get me another one.

712
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:45,471
You never know out in California - all
them cuckoo-heads. You best hold onto it.

713
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:48,273
Now, give it another shot,
you mean boy. Go on.

714
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:50,396
Shoot that damn thing.

715
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:56,799
That's super.
That's some super shootin'. Look at that.

716
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:26,038
Lewiston Abattoir Mt. Juliet, Texas

717
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:32,799
Think we're gonna sit this one out, bud,
if that's to your satisfication.

718
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:34,876
Fine.

719
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:44,556
You need some help, bud, just holler.
I'll be there.

720
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:13,036
Shit.

721
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:58,029
- What is that?
- A copy of the tape they found.

722
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:01,316
He recorded everything.

723
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:06,636
<i>Mister, can you help me?</i>

724
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:13,278
His mother had him workin' in here
before he was eight years old.

725
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:17,234
Killing animals with a sledgehammer
that was bigger than he was.

726
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:22,117
<i>Look. Can you get me</i>
<i>out of here, please?</i>

727
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:28,118
<i>Look. I don't know who you are.</i>
<i>I don't know what you want with me, but</i>

728
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:30,396
<i>please, just let me go, OK?</i>

729
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:33,517
When she was pissed at him...

730
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:36,596
<i>What are you doing?</i>

731
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:38,995
..she'd beat the shit out of him,

732
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:41,759
then lock him in here overnight.

733
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:48,274
<i>My parents, they have money. I can</i>
<i>give you money if that's what you want.</i>

734
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:50,789
<i>- Please! Please let me go.</i>
- One morning,

735
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:56,429
the little boy wakes up,

736
01:05:57,480 --> 01:05:59,516
picks up his sledgehammer...

737
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:03,189
<i>- What are you gonna do with those?</i>
- ..starts hurting back.

738
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:16,074
How does he get from...

739
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:19,198
- What are you doing?
- I'm finished.

740
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:24,912
- I know you're upset about the gun.
- I am not upset about the gun!

741
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:28,993
Yeah, I'm upset about the gun,
but that is not it. It's...

742
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:32,873
God, can we please turn this off!

743
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:39,753
Goddammit, what is going on here?

744
01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:45,109
A week ago you would never
have picked up that gun. Never!

745
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:50,268
And this afternoon you're wielding it
like you're Clyde fucking Barrow.

746
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:52,755
What is going on with you?
Please talk to me.

747
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:56,839
It was stupid. It was a cheap thrill.
I admit it, it was stupid.

748
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:59,630
It was just bang bang, like kids.

749
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:01,709
OK?

750
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:05,913
But I need you to take these photos.
We need them. I don't wanna blow it.

751
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:11,637
Oh, the pictures. The book. God, that
really is all that matters to you, isn't it?

752
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:15,074
That really is all you care about, isn't it?

753
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:18,314
God, I cannot believe I agreed to do this.

754
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:20,954
That is such crap.

755
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:25,471
You know you wanted to take these
photos just as much as I wanted you to.

756
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:27,556
Wrong.

757
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:31,355
Wrong. I was willing to do whatever
it took to get you off of your ass

758
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:35,758
and us on our way to California,
and there's a big difference.

759
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,911
- Early...
- What?

760
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:02,191
- Jesus Christ.
- Sorry.

761
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:06,556
I want him out of our car.

762
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:10,998
- Why? What happened?
- I want him out of our car.

763
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:15,079
- What happened?
- Next gas station it's either him or me.

764
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:43,396
<i>..and forced 7 0 people</i>

<i>to have been arson.</i>

766
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:52,149
Can I get a carton of Victory Kings
and $20 worth of gas in the car. Thanks.

767
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:56,310
Here's your change.

768
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,912
Looks like a bad one's coming in.
Y'all better be careful.

769
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:03,156
Where you headed?

770
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:05,236
California.

771
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:09,874
California. I hear it never rains out there.
Must be nice.

772
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:51,792
Hi, Carrie. I have to go to the bathroom.

773
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:10,472
<i>..fatal stabbing and robbery</i>

01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:36,788

<i>- A nationwide manhunt is on for Grayce.</i>
- Siddown!

783
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:51,479
I knew that boy would
have a hog leg here somewhere.

784
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:53,989
Not a word.

785
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:59,997
Hello. Get over here, skinny.
Sit your ass in that corner.

786
01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:02,316
Come on!

787
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:11,954
- Honey, what are you doing?
- They gave us the boot, momma.

788
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:14,635
Keep Brian busy.
I don't want him comin' in.

789
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:17,035
- You're scaring...
- Not now. Git!

790
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:28,838
Hi.

791
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:32,509
I'm just gettin' my things
and then I'm gonna leave, Brian.

792
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:37,070
- What's your name, boy?
- Walter Livesy.

793
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:41,557
Well, I think I gotta kill you, Walter.
How you feel about that?

794
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:45,031
Not so good.

795
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:47,754
- Are you sure you have to?
- Don't know. Wish I did.

796
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:50,197
- Early, please be...
- Shut up!

797
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:55,711
Goddammit! I'm trying to have
a conversation with Walter.

798
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:00,356
Sorry about that, Walter.

799
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:02,989
Hey, don't forget your yo-yo.

800
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:08,993
Adele, you leaving has nothing to do with
you guys. It's between Carrie and me.

801
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:12,072
Where you from?

802
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:16,676
- Vernon. Florida.
- Don't know it. Any huntin'?

803
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:21,155
Turkeys sometimes.

804
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:25,068
Yeah, turkeys are real smart.
Smarter than most people think.

805
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:30,235
Tell you what, Walter.
I want you down on your belly.

806
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:32,078
Get on your belly.

807
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:36,439
I want you to stay there
for a long time after we leave.

808
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:38,516
- We got a deal, son?
- Yeah. Yes, sir.

809
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:40,512
OK.

810
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:42,835
You mind if I hold onto
that Bible over there?

811
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:45,235
What do you want with a Bible, Walter?

812
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:48,711
He thinks I'm gonna kill him.

813
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:51,274
- Now that'd make me a liar, wouldn't it?
- No, sir.

814
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:53,356
No?

815
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:59,272
There you go, Walter.

816
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:06,438
I wonder if Adele might want it.

817
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:13,076
- What was that?
- Oh, my God.

818
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:15,236
Nothin', Brian. Just the thunder.

819
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:24,434
- Hey, Early! What the fuck are you doing?
- You're gonna like this one, Brian.

820
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:27,990
Get in there. Get over there.
Adele, you're drivin'.

821
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:30,634
- What are you doin'?
- Come on. Let's go.

822
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:39,359
- You all right? What happened?
- Get us out of here, momma.

823
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:49,392
- What happened?
- He shot him in the head. He shot him.

824
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:51,750
No, he didn't.

825
01:14:55,640 --> 01:14:58,552
Everybody just shut up.

826
01:14:58,680 --> 01:15:02,912
Goddamn squawkin' hen.
Nothin's changed.

827
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:06,231
I'm gonna get you there,
safe, to California,

828
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:09,716
if Adele don't kill us with her drivin' first!

829
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:31,910
What'd you get us?

830
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:35,796
I got Chinese food.

831
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:40,911
What is it?

832
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:45,318
The guy, he didn't speak too good
English, Early, so I just got what they had.

833
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:47,670
Smells like butt. Did you get the beer?

834
01:15:50,240 --> 01:15:52,470
What is it, Chink beer?

835
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:54,556
Goddammit, Adele.

836
01:15:57,040 --> 01:16:00,874
Well... give this one to whatshername.

837
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,355
Come over here, bud. Get you some grub.

838
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:07,792
What the hell's a Chinaman doin' in the
middle of an American desert anyhow?

839
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:10,275
Adele, where are the forks and spoons?

840
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:23,035
Is it just me, or has this trip gone downhill
since we ran out of Lucky Lager?

841
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:31,474
Wish I had me some chilli beans.

842
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:44,554
How many people have you killed, Early?

843
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:50,111
Well, now, how many people
you seen me kill, Bri?

844
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:54,317
- None.
- That's how many I killed.

845
01:16:58,680 --> 01:17:01,399
- If you say so.
- Damn right I do.

846
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:04,396
Shut up! Eat your food.

847
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:14,432
You ain't never killed no one,
have you, Bri?

848
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:19,477
- No.
- No. Ain't seen nobody killed, have you?

849
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:23,591
- No, I haven't.
- No.

850
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:28,039
Tell me somethin'.
How you gonna write a book

851
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:31,152
about somethin'
you don't know nothin' about?

852
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:36,831
Momma, sing us a song or... somethin'.

853
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,956
# I

854
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:52,989
# Wish

855
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:57,716
# Carrie was happy

856
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:01,318
# I

857
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:03,476
# Wish

858
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:08,549
# She would smile

859
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:26,829
You guys want your picture taken?

860
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,752
Come on, Carrie, smile.

861
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:45,797
He was breathin'
when I walked out of there.

862
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:48,559
See, Carrie, it's OK. He was breathin'.

863
01:18:50,280 --> 01:18:52,953
Ain't we gettin' near
the next murder site, Bri?

864
01:18:53,080 --> 01:18:56,789
- Forget it. It doesn't matter any more.
- Hell if it don't.

865
01:18:56,920 --> 01:18:58,876
Gimme that map.

866
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:04,317
Someday, me and Adele,
we'll be walkin' along,

867
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:06,874
see your book in some store window.

868
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:10,959
We're gonna buy it and put it on our
coffee table, ain't that right, momma?

869
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:15,678
Davidson Mine Dew Cove, Nevada

870
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:26,310
OK, let's go have us a look, people.

871
01:19:26,440 --> 01:19:30,069
- Early, I'm just gonna stay here.
- You don't wanna go, momma?

872
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:31,998
No?

873
01:19:34,040 --> 01:19:37,828
All right, you watch Carrie.
I'll take the pictures, Bri.

874
01:19:46,440 --> 01:19:49,398
You run and Bri gets it. Karma.

875
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:54,156
Lead the way, bud.

876
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:26,194
So what happened here?

877
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:30,352
Two brothers, prospectors,
lived here in the '70s.

878
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:33,591
Yeah, so?

879
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:37,349
They picked up hitchhikers,
young men, and brought 'em back here.

880
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:43,036
Hey, Bri. This ain't gonna
give me nightmares, now, is it?

881
01:20:43,160 --> 01:20:45,116
Wait. Get out of the way.

882
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:50,030
This one's called ''Walk the Dog''.

883
01:20:57,760 --> 01:20:59,876
My favourite one is ''Rock the Cradle''.

884
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:12,068
They were asked just before they
were executed why they did it.

885
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:14,156
And they said ''To be famous.”

886
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:17,596
Why did you do it, Early?

887
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:21,715
Do what, Bri?

888
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:24,832
You didn't have to kill
the gas station attendant.

889
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:26,916
Move a little to the left.

890
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:34,159
You wanted to. Why?

891
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:41,354
Help me out, Early. You're right.
I don't know shit about killing.

892
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:44,273
You gotta tell me.

893
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:47,390
Does it make you feel good?

894
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:52,312
Powerful?

895
01:21:52,520 --> 01:21:54,954
Superior?

896
01:21:56,120 --> 01:21:58,953
What? Who are you angry with?

897
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:04,153
Your mother? Your father?

898
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:07,879
You wanna know
about my daddy? Do you?

899
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:13,554
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah. I'll tell ya about my daddy.

900
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:18,557
Adele, you gotta help us out of here.
You gotta talk to Early because he's sick.

901
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:22,958
- He needs some sort of help...
- Carrie, you're messin' up my trick.

902
01:22:23,080 --> 01:22:24,991
Adele, listen to me, please.

903
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:30,073
Adele! The police are after him.
He killed a man back there.

904
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:32,156
No, Carrie, that ain't true.

905
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:34,236
I saw him kill a man!

906
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:36,920
No, Carrie, that ain't true.

907
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:40,715
Adele, come on. I'm your friend.
Why would I lie about this?

908
01:22:41,320 --> 01:22:44,471
Why the hell would I lie about this?
I know you know!

909
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:48,070
- Why are you saying these things?
- Why would I lie?

910
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:54,118
He said he didn't do it,
and you ain't my friend!

911
01:22:54,240 --> 01:22:58,472
You're on private property, ladies.
I'd like to see some identification.

912
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:01,717
No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Carrie.
Please don't say anything.

913
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:05,674
- We got a match. I'll call for backup.
- Please, please don't say anything.

914
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:09,675
All right, ladies, I'd like both of you
to step slowly away from the car.

915
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:21,352
Brian!

916
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:26,071
Early!

917
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:28,475
<i>Confirm your location, over.</i>

918
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:30,636
No, Early...

919
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:39,996
Got 'em both on the dead run.

920
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,956
Come on, momma.

921
01:23:52,440 --> 01:23:54,396
Tell me that don't hurt.

922
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:57,756
- Here.
- What?

923
01:23:59,720 --> 01:24:02,473
Gotta put that crippled dog
out of his misery.

924
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:07,710
You wanna know about it,
you gotta do it, son.

925
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:11,276
Shoot him. Come on, lay it on in there.

926
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:14,435
Come on, mean boy.

927
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:17,199
Come on, mean boy. Do it!

928
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:20,551
Shoot him! Shoot the dog.

929
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:24,717
Time to live, boy. Shoot him.

930
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:29,436
Come on. Go! Go, mean boy.

931
01:24:32,920 --> 01:24:36,799
- You faggot.
- Look at his face. It's not your father.

932
01:24:36,920 --> 01:24:38,831
- Look at him!
- I know that, you idiot.

933
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:42,510
That's police in a world of hurtin'.
This here's a mercy killin'.

934
01:24:50,440 --> 01:24:52,795
Let's hit the road.

935
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:05,831
You've not even said thank you.

936
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:08,756
Thank you.

937
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:11,476
Thank you for what, Adele?

938
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:15,875
I don't know, Early.

939
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:19,595
Well, Adele, it's for saving
your fuckin' life back there!

940
01:25:19,720 --> 01:25:23,076
Goddamn! You were this close
from spending the night in the county...

941
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:26,510
- You murdering son of a bitch.
- Stop it, Carrie.

942
01:25:26,640 --> 01:25:28,710
- Are you fucking insane?
- Shut up!

943
01:25:28,840 --> 01:25:30,796
- He's a monster!
- Shut up, Carrie!

944
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:38,713
Goddamn! Bunch of loons.

945
01:25:57,200 --> 01:25:59,998
Look, momma. There's a pretty house.

946
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:03,476
Maybe they got some beer.

947
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:09,476
Look at all the cactuses.

948
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:13,716
They're beautiful.

949
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:16,869
You know what makes
cactuses so strong?

950
01:26:17,800 --> 01:26:21,918
You could just leave 'em and forget
about 'em forever and they'd still live.

951
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:23,638
They keep growin' and...

952
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:27,594
We gotta do somethin'
before Early kills somebody else.

953
01:26:27,720 --> 01:26:30,518
- And they breathe.
- Adele! Will you listen to me?

954
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:37,192
You can't do nothin', Brian. Just sit still.

955
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,275
You have beautiful cactuses, ma'am.

956
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:08,356
I just love them.

957
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:11,755
My momma had a garden.

958
01:27:11,880 --> 01:27:14,758
And I had this little baby cactus.

959
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:18,310
- I was gonna take it and plant it...
- You gotta talk to Adele.

960
01:27:18,440 --> 01:27:20,476
She looks up to you. She'll listen to you.

961
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:23,876
I tried talking to her at the mine.
It didn't work.

962
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:28,596
- Try again.
- Hey, Bri. Did you ever stop...

963
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:33,471
Stop and think if you switched
two letters in your name,

964
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:36,228
it'd spell ''brain''?

965
01:27:42,760 --> 01:27:45,718
Boy, you got a problem.

966
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:50,869
Goddammit.
What's wrong with Grandma?

967
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:05,272
Where's your husband?

968
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:09,878
I'm a widow.

969
01:28:11,560 --> 01:28:13,198
Yeah?

970
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:37,756
That you, Peaches?

971
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:41,519
Sweetheart, hey. Come on over here.

972
01:28:41,640 --> 01:28:43,835
It's so clear you can't believe it.

973
01:28:54,760 --> 01:28:56,716
It's just amazing.

974
01:28:56,840 --> 01:28:59,308
Come on over and look.
Take a look, honey.

975
01:29:08,480 --> 01:29:10,914
I want you to see this, Peaches.

976
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:30,911
Guess what, Early?

977
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:34,999
Miss Musgrave,
she has this guesthouse in the back

978
01:29:35,240 --> 01:29:37,470
and it's really beautiful.

979
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:41,195
And it's empty, hon. She said
if me and you wanted to, honey...

980
01:29:41,320 --> 01:29:43,276
Hank!

981
01:29:49,040 --> 01:29:52,237
Well... you're a widow now, Peaches.

982
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:56,758
Boring.

983
01:29:57,320 --> 01:29:58,833
Boring.

984
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:03,630
Dogshit.

985
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:07,310
That don't leave much
to the imagination, now, does it?

986
01:30:08,200 --> 01:30:10,156
Boring.

987
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:38,160
I know him. That's my daddy.

988
01:30:40,120 --> 01:30:41,758
Fucker.

989
01:30:41,880 --> 01:30:43,677
Boring.

990
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:50,789
You're not gonna die.

991
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:03,316
That's you, ain't it?

992
01:31:09,320 --> 01:31:12,676
Yeah, that's me. Do you like it?
What do you think?

993
01:31:27,960 --> 01:31:29,791
Dogshit.

994
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:32,916
You can go now.

995
01:31:43,160 --> 01:31:45,196
Call me.

996
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:48,235
You ought to control your woman, boy.

997
01:31:48,840 --> 01:31:51,798
Stinking. Stinking.

998
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:54,912
Lucky for you
they take all kinds in California.

999
01:31:56,400 --> 01:31:58,356
That's where we'll be tomorrow.

1000
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:01,796
California.

1001
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:12,070
Don't be stupid.

1002
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:18,872
Goddammit!

1003
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:22,276
Peaches!

1004
01:32:28,080 --> 01:32:30,230
Stop! Stop it, Early.

1005
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:33,235
Stop it.

1006
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:37,953
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna get the piano up.

1007
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:39,672
Try and slide your hands under.

1008
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:43,196
Momma? What are you...?

1009
01:32:44,200 --> 01:32:46,509
What are you cryin' for?
I'm the one who got hit.

1010
01:32:51,640 --> 01:32:54,438
Cos I decided, Early,

1011
01:32:56,160 --> 01:32:59,470
I'm not gonna climb up
that Hollywood sign with you.

1012
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:02,114
- And why not?
- You're mean, Early.

1013
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:06,913
- No, I'm not.
- You hurt those people, Early.

1014
01:33:07,240 --> 01:33:09,959
I don't wanna do it with you.

1015
01:33:10,080 --> 01:33:12,071
I loved you, Early.

1016
01:33:12,200 --> 01:33:14,555
You just be quiet. You are mean.

1017
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:30,279
Run. Go!

1018
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:33,312
No, I'm not leaving you here. Wait.

1019
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:36,436
Go!

1020
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:43,317
- Adele!
- Shut up!

1021
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:02,276
Looks like I need me a new woman.

1022
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:06,114
- No! Not him.
- Shut up.

1023
01:34:07,080 --> 01:34:09,036
Jesus! No!

1024
01:34:09,160 --> 01:34:12,277
Oh, God, Early, I'll do anything.
I'll go with you. Please.

1025
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:15,392
Please don't kill him.
Oh, God, I'll do anything.

1026
01:34:16,600 --> 01:34:18,397
Please don't kill him!

1027
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:45,556
Oh, momma, we gotta find us a door.
Save us some time.

1028
01:34:45,680 --> 01:34:47,636
Goddamn, that's a super dress.

1029
01:34:48,720 --> 01:34:50,676
Yeah, that's just super.

1030
01:34:55,680 --> 01:34:57,636
Shit.

1031
01:36:08,600 --> 01:36:12,354
Oh. I didn't think he left anyone alive.

1032
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:16,318
- Where's Carrie?
- They took off down the road.

1033
01:36:17,880 --> 01:36:19,836
Watch your head.

1034
01:36:23,240 --> 01:36:25,231
Grab that chair.

1035
01:36:26,160 --> 01:36:28,720
I'm gonna lift the piano. Slide it under.

1036
01:36:43,120 --> 01:36:47,193
He pulled out all the phone lines.
The nearest one is 21 miles away.

1037
01:36:49,120 --> 01:36:53,113
- He took the fire road west.
- Take your car and get to that phone.

1038
01:36:53,240 --> 01:36:55,196
Call the police.

1039
01:37:44,920 --> 01:37:47,275
Well, how y'all doin'?

1040
01:37:47,400 --> 01:37:50,915
I'm Early. This is my woman, Carrie.

1041
01:37:51,880 --> 01:37:56,908
Sorry to inconvenience y'all like this,
but looks like we'll be stayin' the night.

1042
01:37:57,480 --> 01:38:01,519
Don't you move!
You Pinocchio-lookin' knuckleheads.

1043
01:41:08,240 --> 01:41:09,912
No!

1044
01:41:39,360 --> 01:41:45,435
Dreamland Nuclear Test Range
California-Nevada Border

1045
01:42:15,880 --> 01:42:18,155
Door. Who would it be?

1046
01:42:50,440 --> 01:42:52,670
Carrie!

1047
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:21,752
Motherfucker!

1048
01:43:42,880 --> 01:43:44,836
Bri came back.

1049
01:43:46,360 --> 01:43:49,955
Hey, Bri.
You wanna ask me some questions?

1050
01:43:57,400 --> 01:44:00,073
Ask me some questions. Come on.

1051
01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:06,434
Do I feel powerful? Do I feel superior? No.

1052
01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:13,158
No.

1053
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:15,876
I feel good.

1054
01:44:18,680 --> 01:44:21,353
Bri, you're bleedin'.

1055
01:44:23,520 --> 01:44:25,476
Bri. You're bleedin'!

1056
01:44:27,800 --> 01:44:32,237
# Cos I'm as free as a bird

1057
01:44:32,840 --> 01:44:34,831
Skynyrd, man!

1058
01:44:34,960 --> 01:44:39,158
Lynyrd Skynyrd. I like that one.

1059
01:45:08,520 --> 01:45:10,317
The keys.

1060
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:13,636
They're around his neck.

1061
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:23,276
<i>I'll never know why</i>
<i>Early Grayce became a killer.</i>

1062
01:46:23,400 --> 01:46:25,356
<i>I don't know why any of them do.</i>

1063
01:46:26,480 --> 01:46:28,710
<i>When I looked into his eyes,</i>

1064
01:46:28,840 --> 01:46:31,035
<i>I felt nothing.</i>

1065
01:46:31,160 --> 01:46:33,355
<i>Nothing.</i>

1066
01:46:33,480 --> 01:46:37,393
<i>That day I learned that any one of us</i>
<i>is capable of taking another human life.</i>

1067
01:46:38,880 --> 01:46:43,032
<i>But I also learned that there is</i>
<i>a difference between us and them.</i>

1068
01:46:43,160 --> 01:46:45,355
<i>It's in feeling remorse.</i>

1069
01:46:45,480 --> 01:46:47,436
<i>Dealing with guilt.</i>

1070
01:46:48,120 --> 01:46:50,236
<i>And confronting your conscience.</i>

1071
01:46:51,280 --> 01:46:53,236
<i>Early never did.</i>

1072
01:47:07,280 --> 01:47:09,396
<i>June 22nd. The Novak farm.</i>

1073
01:47:09,520 --> 01:47:14,275
<i>Mr. Baxter slammed the door in my face</i>
<i>today, calling me a goddamn ghoul.</i>

1074
01:47:47,280 --> 01:47:49,589
<i>I'm bettin' he's still alive.</i>

1075
01:47:50,480 --> 01:47:53,392
<i>Real old, livin' in a trailer park</i>
<i>or somethin', somewheres.</i>

1076
01:47:53,520 --> 01:47:55,590
<i>But he's alive, see.</i>

1077
01:47:55,720 --> 01:47:58,075
<i>Now, he's thinkin' about what he done,</i>

1078
01:47:58,200 --> 01:48:02,398
<i>goin' over it and over it and over it</i>
<i>in his head, every night,</i>

1079
01:48:02,520 --> 01:48:05,671
<i>thinkin' how smart he is</i>
<i>for gettin' away with it.</i>

1080
01:48:06,400 --> 01:48:08,356
<i>Thinkin'.</i>

1081
01:48:11,440 --> 01:48:13,829
Hey, how's it goin'?

1082
01:48:13,960 --> 01:48:16,679
Not bad. How was your swim?

1083
01:48:17,520 --> 01:48:20,592
- It's freezing.
- It's November.

1084
01:48:22,680 --> 01:48:24,477
I know.

1085
01:48:28,240 --> 01:48:30,834
There's this gallery in Venice,

1086
01:48:30,960 --> 01:48:34,191
and I showed them my work,
the icon series.

1087
01:48:34,320 --> 01:48:36,914
- I think they're interested.
- That's great.

1088
01:48:37,040 --> 01:48:39,998
Well, it's not definite, but it's encouraging.

1089
01:48:42,360 --> 01:48:44,749
Well, let's celebrate. I'll take you to lunch.

1090
01:48:45,040 --> 01:48:47,110
OK.

1091
01:48:47,680 --> 01:48:51,673
- So what happens next?
- Well, I have a meeting at the gallery,

1092
01:48:51,800 --> 01:48:55,395
and they want to see
some more of my work. So...

1093
01:48:55,520 --> 01:48:58,751
I'm sure they're gonna love it
as much as I do.

1094
01:49:00,240 --> 01:49:02,151
<i>Hi!</i>

1095
01:49:02,280 --> 01:49:04,669
<i>Guess who this is?</i>

1096
01:49:04,800 --> 01:49:07,473
<i>It's me, it's Adele.</i>

1097
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:11,957
<i>I know I'm probably not supposed</i>
<i>to be talkin' on the tape recorder, but...</i>

1098
01:49:12,080 --> 01:49:14,389
<i>I just wanted to say thank you</i>

1099
01:49:14,520 --> 01:49:17,637

<i>havin' a really good time.</i>

1101
01:49:24,680 --> 01:49:28,195
<i>I just hope that</i>
<i>when we get to California,</i>

1102
01:49:28,320 --> 01:49:31,471
<i>that you guys don't forget all about us.</i>

1103
01:49:31,600 --> 01:49:34,717
<i>Cos friends are important and...</i>

1104
01:49:34,840 --> 01:49:38,230
<i>Well, you're the only friends we got.</i>

1105
01:49:39,160 --> 01:49:40,639
<i>Bye.</i>
