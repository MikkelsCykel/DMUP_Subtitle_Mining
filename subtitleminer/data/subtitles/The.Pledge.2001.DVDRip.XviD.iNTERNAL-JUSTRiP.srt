1
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:20,891
She said it.

2
00:01:21,453 --> 00:01:23,125
She said it.

3
00:01:23,453 --> 00:01:24,852
She did.

4
00:05:11,733 --> 00:05:14,452
--with some precipitation
in the Central Valley.

5
00:05:14,693 --> 00:05:18,242
Reno area, a little milder.
Looking like a low 37 degrees...

6
00:05:18,493 --> 00:05:20,563
...and a high at 42.

7
00:05:21,053 --> 00:05:23,726
The low-pressure system
continues into the Sierras.

8
00:05:23,973 --> 00:05:27,727
We've got some snow flurries at times
down at about 5000 feet.

9
00:05:27,973 --> 00:05:30,009
We'll see some hazy sunshine
in the morning.

10
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:35,282
Yo, Mick.

11
00:05:36,453 --> 00:05:37,363
Yeah, okay.

12
00:05:37,613 --> 00:05:38,966
Thank you.

13
00:05:56,653 --> 00:05:58,006
-Good morning.
-Jerry.

14
00:06:04,013 --> 00:06:05,890
-There you are.
-Morning.

15
00:06:07,053 --> 00:06:09,726
Plug that fridge back in.
l thought it was going with you.

16
00:06:10,253 --> 00:06:13,723
l put everything in boxes.
Everything except your pictures.

17
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:17,409
Every time l pack pictures, something
gets broken and l get blamed.

18
00:06:17,653 --> 00:06:19,086
So you can do that yourself.

19
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:21,130
Don't forget lunch
with the lieutenant.

20
00:06:21,373 --> 00:06:22,931
-1:30!
-lt's at--

21
00:06:23,733 --> 00:06:26,406
-lt's at 1:30.
-At the Luau.

22
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:29,247
lt's at 1:30 at the Luau.

23
00:06:30,533 --> 00:06:31,727
Thank you, Jean.

24
00:06:32,133 --> 00:06:34,328
l'm out here if you need me.

25
00:08:10,853 --> 00:08:15,369
Driver of the yellow car, Reno police.
No more parking on the street today.

26
00:08:19,053 --> 00:08:20,168
Move it.

27
00:08:27,253 --> 00:08:28,891
Come on, Stan, you're late.

28
00:08:57,853 --> 00:08:59,650
Surprise!

29
00:09:14,293 --> 00:09:15,487
Congratulations, Jerry.

30
00:09:15,733 --> 00:09:18,884
-l saw you parking on the street.
-You saw that?

31
00:09:19,933 --> 00:09:22,163
Hey, Larry. You outlasted me.

32
00:09:22,413 --> 00:09:23,766
Hey, thanks for coming.

33
00:09:24,013 --> 00:09:26,607
-Good to see you. Thanks.
-Congratulations.

34
00:11:01,693 --> 00:11:02,967
lsn't that smart?

35
00:11:04,773 --> 00:11:06,525
Thank you. Thank you.

36
00:11:10,373 --> 00:11:11,806
Knowing you like we do, Jerry. . .

37
00:11:12,053 --> 00:11:14,283
. . .we thought it was time
you got that marlin. . .

38
00:11:14,533 --> 00:11:16,967
. . .you been dreaming about
for all these years.

39
00:11:17,213 --> 00:11:19,727
So the whole department,
officers, staff. . .

40
00:11:19,973 --> 00:11:23,443
. . .volunteers, everybody,
we all pooled our nickels together. . .

41
00:11:23,693 --> 00:11:25,206
. . .and got you this ticket.

42
00:11:25,453 --> 00:11:28,286
lt's supposed to be the best
marlin fishing in Baja.

43
00:11:28,533 --> 00:11:31,172
So go catch a big one for us, Jer.

44
00:11:38,013 --> 00:11:39,412
Gee.

45
00:11:39,653 --> 00:11:40,881
Well.

46
00:11:41,853 --> 00:11:44,128
Appreciation all around.

47
00:11:45,693 --> 00:11:48,924
What can l say? You shouldn't have.

48
00:11:49,173 --> 00:11:50,811
But you did. . .

49
00:11:54,853 --> 00:11:56,286
. . .and it hits me deep.

50
00:11:57,693 --> 00:11:58,921
Thank you.

51
00:13:30,813 --> 00:13:33,964
l'm going back to the station.
Get Becker County on the phone.

52
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:36,681
-You should go on.
-lt'll be dark when we get there.

53
00:13:36,933 --> 00:13:37,888
Thanks.

54
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:40,722
What's up?

55
00:13:41,413 --> 00:13:43,165
-Juvenile homicide.
-Becker County.

56
00:13:43,413 --> 00:13:45,404
Possible sexual assault. Little girl.

57
00:13:45,653 --> 00:13:47,166
The locals aren't handling it?

58
00:13:47,413 --> 00:13:50,246
Our hard-core crime unit
assists that jurisdiction now.

59
00:13:50,493 --> 00:13:53,166
Jerry, for chrissake,
you're retiring.

60
00:13:54,013 --> 00:13:55,446
l still got six more hours.

61
00:13:55,693 --> 00:13:58,685
As far as l'm concerned, you're gone.
lt's Krolack's case.

62
00:13:58,933 --> 00:14:01,242
-He's in charge, his call.
-lt's fine with me.

63
00:14:01,493 --> 00:14:05,372
-lf you want to leave your own party.
-My coat's upstairs.

64
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:12,970
Good evening.
Elena Ryan, just outside of Reno.

65
00:14:13,213 --> 00:14:15,044
Behind, you have the crime scene. . .

66
00:14:15,293 --> 00:14:18,091
. . .where the body of a young girl
has just been found.

67
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:21,609
And we have emergency vehicles
coming in and out of here.

68
00:14:23,053 --> 00:14:26,125
We have state troopers,
we have Reno police.

69
00:14:45,693 --> 00:14:50,721
Bruising and lacerations evident
on the interior of both thighs.

70
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:56,127
Bruising and possible wrist
fractures due to restraints.

71
00:14:56,653 --> 00:14:57,722
Neck slashed.

72
00:14:57,973 --> 00:14:59,531
Did you get her age in there?

73
00:15:00,773 --> 00:15:04,561
She was a second-grader.
l guess about 71 /2, 8.

74
00:15:06,373 --> 00:15:07,965
Coupled with signs of lividity. . .

75
00:15:08,213 --> 00:15:11,285
. . .all indications are she wasn't
moved from place of death.

76
00:15:11,533 --> 00:15:13,205
We checked the entire perimeter.

77
00:15:13,453 --> 00:15:16,206
Even with the snow,
this path's the only way in or out.

78
00:15:16,453 --> 00:15:19,411
-Why the fuck are you standing on it?
-Oh, l'm sorry.

79
00:15:19,653 --> 00:15:22,213
--and other weather-related
contamination. . . .

80
00:15:22,453 --> 00:15:24,683
Whose fucking pen is this?

81
00:15:24,933 --> 00:15:28,323
Oh, Jesus, that's--
lt's mine. Pardon me.

82
00:15:28,693 --> 00:15:29,967
Any sign of a weapon?

83
00:15:30,213 --> 00:15:34,491
No, but, l mean, a knife like that,
you could chuck it pretty far.

84
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:37,930
-Assuming it was a knife.
-How long before you can wrap this up?

85
00:15:38,173 --> 00:15:39,083
Couple more minutes.

86
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:41,722
l'll let the coroner know
he can pick her up.

87
00:15:43,213 --> 00:15:44,441
The buttons.

88
00:15:44,773 --> 00:15:47,810
Have the lab guys
check for prints on the buttons. . .

89
00:15:48,053 --> 00:15:51,409
. . .on both the coat and the dress.

90
00:15:51,933 --> 00:15:53,525
Goddamn it.

91
00:15:55,773 --> 00:15:58,003
Strom, secure all the buttons
for lab work. . .

92
00:15:58,253 --> 00:15:59,527
. . .before you move her out.

93
00:15:59,773 --> 00:16:02,367
-Guys, get the buttons.
-Let's go, big guy.

94
00:16:15,493 --> 00:16:17,404
What about the little girl's parents?

95
00:16:17,653 --> 00:16:19,325
Duane and Margaret Larsen.

96
00:16:19,573 --> 00:16:21,962
They got a turkey farm
100 miles from here.

97
00:16:22,213 --> 00:16:24,568
-Good people.
-Go ahead and pick her up now!

98
00:16:25,013 --> 00:16:27,607
-Have you interviewed them?
-No.

99
00:16:28,413 --> 00:16:29,687
We haven't told them yet.

100
00:16:30,493 --> 00:16:32,290
None of us knew what to say!

101
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:36,011
Jesus Christ.

102
00:16:36,533 --> 00:16:38,649
Nobody told the little girl's parents.

103
00:16:39,573 --> 00:16:41,848
-ls this the little boy right here?
-Yeah.

104
00:16:44,933 --> 00:16:46,412
Evening, son.

105
00:16:48,813 --> 00:16:50,531
Chilly out here, isn't it?

106
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,527
Take him to your station.
l'll talk to him there.

107
00:16:56,773 --> 00:17:00,004
-Right.
-Anything on the suspect or his truck?

108
00:17:00,253 --> 00:17:01,368
Hang on.

109
00:17:02,173 --> 00:17:03,811
Highway Patrol got anything?

110
00:17:04,053 --> 00:17:06,044
Todd said he put it out there.

111
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:11,325
lt's out statewide,
and l got Highway Patrol on it.

112
00:17:11,573 --> 00:17:13,404
Congratulations.

113
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,330
Now, who's gonna tell the parents?

114
00:17:19,493 --> 00:17:21,006
Does anybody here know them?

115
00:17:21,413 --> 00:17:24,405
l got one of my deputies,
but he'd rather not.

116
00:17:29,773 --> 00:17:31,491
He'd rather not.

117
00:18:53,253 --> 00:18:57,405
Most Wednesdays,
Ginny stays in town. . .

118
00:18:58,213 --> 00:19:00,886
. . .for music lessons with my mother.

119
00:19:01,813 --> 00:19:03,769
But when she's behind
on her homework. . .

120
00:19:04,013 --> 00:19:06,925
. . .she comes straight home.

121
00:19:09,853 --> 00:19:14,290
So her grandmother would've
assumed that she came home?

122
00:19:15,693 --> 00:19:17,684
We always let Ginny. . . .

123
00:19:18,253 --> 00:19:19,606
Yes.

124
00:19:22,573 --> 00:19:23,767
Excuse me.

125
00:19:24,013 --> 00:19:26,925
-Pastor Holcomb's on his way over.
-Thank you.

126
00:19:27,173 --> 00:19:29,687
Would you mind not smoking
in the house, please?

127
00:19:29,933 --> 00:19:30,922
Sorry.

128
00:19:35,533 --> 00:19:37,683
lt isn't possible.

129
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:41,692
There can't be such a devil.

130
00:19:42,573 --> 00:19:44,564
There are such devils.

131
00:19:53,013 --> 00:19:55,163
l want to see my daughter.

132
00:19:55,973 --> 00:19:59,932
l don't think that's
a good idea, Mr. Larsen.

133
00:20:00,173 --> 00:20:04,212
l know what l'm saying
might sound cruel. . .

134
00:20:04,693 --> 00:20:07,685
. . .but l think it's better
if you don't go to your Ginny now.

135
00:20:07,933 --> 00:20:12,484
Why would it be better for me
not to see my daughter?

136
00:20:12,733 --> 00:20:14,405
Why would that be better?!

137
00:20:19,813 --> 00:20:23,203
Because we hardly dared
to look ourselves.

138
00:20:28,053 --> 00:20:31,125
You can go to your
Ginny tomorrow evening.

139
00:20:35,453 --> 00:20:37,762
Then there won't be
anything that's. . . .

140
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:41,131
-What?
-She'll look like she fell asleep.

141
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:42,647
Believe me.

142
00:20:48,933 --> 00:20:50,207
Who did this?

143
00:20:51,213 --> 00:20:53,408
We intend to find out, Mrs. Larsen.

144
00:20:54,053 --> 00:20:55,771
Do you promise me that you will?

145
00:21:06,013 --> 00:21:07,241
Yes.

146
00:21:07,773 --> 00:21:11,368
Yes, Mrs. Larsen, l promise.

147
00:21:14,853 --> 00:21:17,367
By your soul's salvation?

148
00:21:22,293 --> 00:21:23,931
Do you swear. . .

149
00:21:26,573 --> 00:21:29,724
. . .by your soul's salvation
on this cross. . .

150
00:21:29,973 --> 00:21:32,328
. . .made by the hands of our daughter?

151
00:21:38,493 --> 00:21:39,767
Yes.

152
00:21:42,813 --> 00:21:45,327
Yes, on my soul's salvation.

153
00:21:50,813 --> 00:21:54,931
You've sworn by your salvation.

154
00:22:01,293 --> 00:22:02,646
We will pray.

155
00:22:38,173 --> 00:22:39,367
Detective!

156
00:22:40,013 --> 00:22:41,571
Detective Black?

157
00:22:42,853 --> 00:22:44,491
Looks like they got him.

158
00:22:44,733 --> 00:22:48,692
Highway Patrol picked up a match
on the truck with an lndian driver.

159
00:22:56,493 --> 00:23:00,486
l gave you a new headband, Toby.
l know you lost yours.

160
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:04,608
Toby, l can't see your eyes, buddy.

161
00:23:04,973 --> 00:23:06,531
You'll like this.

162
00:23:06,773 --> 00:23:08,001
Let's see it.

163
00:23:13,533 --> 00:23:17,412
Toby, you've already served time
for one charge of juvenile rape now.

164
00:23:17,773 --> 00:23:21,243
Statutory.
The girl was 16 years old.

165
00:23:21,493 --> 00:23:24,246
Toby, would you tell him
that rape is rape?

166
00:23:24,493 --> 00:23:27,883
You got three years of juvenile,
you got some burglary. . .

167
00:23:28,133 --> 00:23:30,408
. . .you got some theft, grand theft.

168
00:23:30,973 --> 00:23:34,329
Multiple counts of marijuana
possession. Then that first rape.

169
00:23:34,573 --> 00:23:38,168
Section Four.
Man's got a mental handicap, Stan.

170
00:23:38,413 --> 00:23:39,448
No.

171
00:23:39,693 --> 00:23:43,971
Well, number one, that might not
take the violence out of you.

172
00:23:44,213 --> 00:23:46,283
Number two,
l'm gonna get a confession.

173
00:23:46,533 --> 00:23:50,367
And number three,
l'm gonna do it in record time.

174
00:24:00,653 --> 00:24:02,245
How you doing, chief?

175
00:24:03,773 --> 00:24:06,685
Scared of this thing?
Let's get it out of the way then.

176
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:17,045
Who you talking to, chief?

177
00:24:22,253 --> 00:24:24,528
You got those little voices
in your head?

178
00:24:30,893 --> 00:24:33,771
-You a policeman?
-Yeah, l'm a policeman.

179
00:24:35,773 --> 00:24:38,333
-l want to be a policeman too.
-You do, huh?

180
00:24:38,573 --> 00:24:42,248
Policeman drive me here very fast.
Drive me fast.

181
00:24:42,893 --> 00:24:46,010
-l'm just a trapper.
-We don't need this.

182
00:24:48,293 --> 00:24:49,692
l trap beaver today.

183
00:24:50,693 --> 00:24:52,809
Fifteen pounds or 25. . .

184
00:24:53,053 --> 00:24:56,728
. . .or 35, something like that.
Maybe 80.

185
00:24:58,013 --> 00:25:00,129
You mean beaver or you mean ''beaver''?

186
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:03,012
-Beaver.
-Beaver? Pretty, young pussy?

187
00:25:08,293 --> 00:25:11,126
-l don't know you joking me.
-You think l'm joking?

188
00:25:11,373 --> 00:25:12,249
-l don't know.
-No?

189
00:25:12,493 --> 00:25:15,087
l'm not joking you.
So you catch beaver, huh?

190
00:25:15,333 --> 00:25:16,561
Yeah, l--

191
00:25:18,933 --> 00:25:21,572
-Yeah, l catch beaver.
-You catch beaver? Little girl?

192
00:25:21,813 --> 00:25:25,328
You catch little girl today, huh?
You rape little girl?

193
00:25:25,573 --> 00:25:26,847
ls that what you did?

194
00:25:27,293 --> 00:25:28,692
l rape, l rape.

195
00:25:28,933 --> 00:25:30,207
You raped her, huh?

196
00:25:39,013 --> 00:25:39,923
Yeah.

197
00:25:40,893 --> 00:25:44,249
He could be talking about the
other rape, the one on his record.

198
00:25:44,493 --> 00:25:46,245
We got positive l.D. from the kid.

199
00:25:46,493 --> 00:25:49,007
This is a small town.
Just let him do his job.

200
00:25:49,253 --> 00:25:50,481
Tell me about the girl.

201
00:25:54,293 --> 00:25:55,965
You rape a little girl today?

202
00:25:59,693 --> 00:26:00,887
lt's okay.

203
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:02,362
You can tell me.

204
00:26:06,733 --> 00:26:08,052
You killed her.

205
00:26:08,893 --> 00:26:10,292
Didn't you, Toby?

206
00:26:11,893 --> 00:26:15,010
lt's all right.
lt's okay, bud. Huh?

207
00:26:17,613 --> 00:26:20,286
Something simply came
over you today, didn't it?

208
00:26:22,253 --> 00:26:24,528
All at once you became like an animal?

209
00:26:28,413 --> 00:26:30,563
You attacked and you raped her.

210
00:26:30,973 --> 00:26:32,884
You raped that little girl.

211
00:26:38,653 --> 00:26:42,566
Then, Toby, you know,
without wanting to--

212
00:26:43,373 --> 00:26:45,967
But sometimes you can't
stop yourself, you know?

213
00:26:46,213 --> 00:26:48,044
And you murdered her, didn't you?

214
00:26:51,773 --> 00:26:53,729
That hurts right there, doesn't it?

215
00:26:58,173 --> 00:26:59,162
Yeah?

216
00:26:59,413 --> 00:27:00,971
You like that, huh?

217
00:27:01,213 --> 00:27:03,568
You like that? Huh?

218
00:27:03,813 --> 00:27:06,327
Maybe you just wanted her to be quiet.

219
00:27:07,533 --> 00:27:09,922
You just wanted her
to stop screaming at you.

220
00:27:11,013 --> 00:27:13,368
Something was stronger than you, Toby.

221
00:27:14,973 --> 00:27:17,203
Then, when you came to yourself...

222
00:27:18,333 --> 00:27:19,891
. . .you were horrified.

223
00:27:22,373 --> 00:27:24,568
Then you saw that little girl. . .

224
00:27:25,253 --> 00:27:26,891
. . .and you ran.

225
00:27:27,133 --> 00:27:30,284
-l ran. l ran, l ran.
-Yeah, you ran.

226
00:27:30,533 --> 00:27:32,967
-Yeah. l ran.
-lt's all right.

227
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:35,365
lt's all right, Toby.

228
00:27:36,893 --> 00:27:38,963
-l ran.
-You ran.

229
00:27:39,293 --> 00:27:41,807
-Yeah.
-lt's all right.

230
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:49,532
You want to cry?

231
00:27:51,573 --> 00:27:54,167
Come here. Come here.

232
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:01,566
lt's all right. Come on.

233
00:28:03,333 --> 00:28:05,642
You've gotta stand up
for what you did, okay?

234
00:28:05,893 --> 00:28:06,928
You gotta stand up.

235
00:28:07,173 --> 00:28:11,564
-He don't know what Stan's saying.
-Stand up and confess. okay?

236
00:28:19,013 --> 00:28:20,446
lt's all right.

237
00:28:31,173 --> 00:28:32,891
l killed her.

238
00:28:35,573 --> 00:28:36,767
You killed her?

239
00:28:37,013 --> 00:28:38,605
-l killed her.
-You killed her?

240
00:28:38,853 --> 00:28:39,888
Yeah.

241
00:28:43,933 --> 00:28:46,003
-Say it.
-I killed a little girl.

242
00:28:46,253 --> 00:28:48,084
-Say it.
-l killed a little girl.

243
00:28:48,333 --> 00:28:50,289
You killed that little girl?

244
00:28:50,533 --> 00:28:53,127
-You killed that little girl?
-Yeah, yeah.

245
00:28:54,053 --> 00:28:56,965
Say it. Just put your hand
up to heaven and say it.

246
00:28:57,213 --> 00:28:59,966
What did you say? Say it!

247
00:29:00,893 --> 00:29:02,372
Say it, Toby!

248
00:29:03,133 --> 00:29:05,203
Yeah, you killed her,
didn 't you, Toby?

249
00:29:05,453 --> 00:29:06,932
-Yeah, it's okay.
-I kill, I--

250
00:29:07,173 --> 00:29:10,882
Toby, Toby, it's okay.

251
00:29:11,893 --> 00:29:13,212
l got you.

252
00:29:13,933 --> 00:29:15,924
He practically blew him.

253
00:29:23,133 --> 00:29:24,361
Coroner just called.

254
00:29:24,613 --> 00:29:27,002
They found chocolate
in the girl's stomach.

255
00:29:27,373 --> 00:29:29,728
We got wrappers in the cab
of the lndian's truck.

256
00:29:29,973 --> 00:29:31,326
Deputy!

257
00:29:33,013 --> 00:29:34,207
There you go.

258
00:29:38,173 --> 00:29:40,004
-Come on, Toby.
-Goddamn it!

259
00:29:44,453 --> 00:29:47,763
Come on, walk like a policeman, Toby.
You're a policeman now.

260
00:29:50,493 --> 00:29:51,721
Okay to use this phone?

261
00:29:51,973 --> 00:29:54,646
-Yeah, go ahead.
-Christ!

262
00:29:59,893 --> 00:30:03,249
-You fish the lakes up here, l'm told?
-Yeah.

263
00:30:03,773 --> 00:30:05,650
Anglers haven't been doing much.

264
00:30:05,893 --> 00:30:09,966
The spear houses have hit pretty heavy.
lt could be the snow cover.

265
00:30:10,213 --> 00:30:11,612
Could be that.

266
00:30:11,853 --> 00:30:13,445
What about the--?

267
00:30:15,173 --> 00:30:18,165
He's got my gun! He's got my gun!

268
00:30:19,973 --> 00:30:23,488
-Tell me when, Jerry.
-Drop it!

269
00:30:23,733 --> 00:30:25,212
-He's got Hamilton!
-Let go!

270
00:30:25,453 --> 00:30:27,364
-Freeze!
-Put it down, Toby!

271
00:30:28,253 --> 00:30:29,652
No!

272
00:30:30,373 --> 00:30:33,649
Don't shoot me! Please don't!
Don't shoot me!

273
00:30:33,893 --> 00:30:35,884
-Toby, put it down!

274
00:30:36,133 --> 00:30:37,122

-Oh, God.

278
00:30:50,493 --> 00:30:53,485
-Fitz!
-Hamilton! Michael!

279
00:30:53,733 --> 00:30:54,927
Are you hit?

280
00:30:56,413 --> 00:30:58,643
-l don't think so.
-Oh, Jesus.

281
00:30:58,893 --> 00:31:01,248
All right. Oh, Mike, you all right?

282
00:31:04,453 --> 00:31:06,603
Oh, my God.

283
00:31:08,973 --> 00:31:10,486
-Jesus Christ.
-You all right?

284
00:31:11,173 --> 00:31:13,004
-Get an ambulance. Do it.
-Right.

285
00:31:13,573 --> 00:31:17,805
-l thought he was gonna kill me.
-You're all right! You're okay.

286
00:31:23,933 --> 00:31:25,571
What's that, the bullet?

287
00:31:26,853 --> 00:31:28,366
His tooth.

288
00:31:34,653 --> 00:31:37,406
Gate 42. They'll be boarding
in about half an hour.

289
00:31:37,653 --> 00:31:40,725
-ls that Concourse E?
-Yes, it is, sir.

290
00:31:40,973 --> 00:31:42,929
-Thank you very much.
-You're welcome.

291
00:31:43,173 --> 00:31:44,891
Next in line, please.

292
00:31:47,213 --> 00:31:48,805
Hi, how are you folks today?

293
00:31:49,053 --> 00:31:51,408
Thank you.
Going to Cabo San Lucas today.

294
00:31:51,653 --> 00:31:55,566
Wadenah had been previously convicted
of similar crimes and was on parole.

295
00:31:55,813 --> 00:31:58,771
Regarding the suicide of
the suspect while in custody...

296
00:31:59,013 --> 00:32:01,811
... State's Attorney Paul Ross
has organized a committee...

297
00:32:02,053 --> 00:32:05,284
... to look into the tactics
of the Becker County Sheriff's office.

298
00:32:08,293 --> 00:32:09,248
You okay?

299
00:32:11,613 --> 00:32:12,602
Yes, thank you.

300
00:32:13,213 --> 00:32:15,522
Sheriff's investigators
worked in concert...

301
00:32:15,773 --> 00:32:18,446
... with Reno homicide detectives
for several hours...

302
00:32:18,693 --> 00:32:23,483
...piecing together the trail that led
to the brisk apprehension of Wadenah.

303
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:26,327
Authorities here,
while understandably disturbed...

304
00:32:26,573 --> 00:32:29,246
...by the brief hostage-taking
of one of their deputies...

305
00:32:29,493 --> 00:32:31,131
...are taking some comfort...

306
00:32:31,933 --> 00:32:35,323
. . .in the swift justice of this
very dramatic evening.

307
00:32:41,573 --> 00:32:45,964
Yet, while an investigation is
underway, the consensus seems clear.

308
00:32:46,213 --> 00:32:49,967
Wadenah confessed after being
identified by the young snowmobiler.

309
00:32:50,213 --> 00:32:53,011
His suicide brought a brutal end....

310
00:32:53,253 --> 00:32:57,724
Final boarding call, Northwest
flight 1607 to Cabo San Lucas.

311
00:34:18,013 --> 00:34:19,287
Customer, Oliver!

312
00:34:26,213 --> 00:34:27,646
-Morning.
-Morning.

313
00:34:27,893 --> 00:34:31,442
Nice day today. Can we help you
with anything in particular?

314
00:34:31,693 --> 00:34:32,921
Well, actually, there is.

315
00:34:33,373 --> 00:34:38,447
l'm looking for a person.
Annalise, or Anna-Lisa Hansen.

316
00:34:38,853 --> 00:34:43,005
Yes. She would live above
the electric store.

317
00:34:43,613 --> 00:34:47,686
That would be a small unit.
lt's two doors down to your left.

318
00:34:49,133 --> 00:34:53,604
And if l were you, l'd go around
the corner and take the stairs up.

319
00:34:54,013 --> 00:34:56,891
You shouldn't have
any trouble finding her.

320
00:34:57,293 --> 00:34:58,885
lf you don't, come back.

321
00:34:59,133 --> 00:35:00,771
Thank you. l appreciate it.

322
00:35:01,013 --> 00:35:02,446
You're welcome.

323
00:35:14,933 --> 00:35:17,970
So, what is it that you need to know?

324
00:35:20,013 --> 00:35:22,971
Well, l'm trying to fill in the gaps.

325
00:35:25,013 --> 00:35:27,732
Fit all the pieces
together, Mrs. Hansen.

326
00:35:27,973 --> 00:35:30,771
lf you could remember anything. . .

327
00:35:31,013 --> 00:35:33,971
. . .from when you were interviewed. . .

328
00:35:34,693 --> 00:35:36,729
. . .anything in particular
that might. . . .

329
00:35:38,613 --> 00:35:40,968
lt was Wednesday and she never came.

330
00:35:41,213 --> 00:35:44,364
They said that she
never got on the bus. . .

331
00:35:44,613 --> 00:35:46,968
. . .never even made it to the school.

332
00:35:47,213 --> 00:35:50,683
l assumed that she'd gone home.

333
00:35:56,973 --> 00:35:59,168
What was she like?

334
00:36:00,333 --> 00:36:03,166
What were your Wednesdays
with Ginny. . .

335
00:36:03,413 --> 00:36:04,562
. . .what were they like?

336
00:36:05,853 --> 00:36:09,562
Oh, she would come in
with her little knapsack. . .

337
00:36:09,813 --> 00:36:13,123
. . .and plop it on the floor.

338
00:36:14,053 --> 00:36:16,089
Give me a kiss on my cheek.

339
00:36:16,333 --> 00:36:18,722
Big kiss, always my left cheek.

340
00:36:21,533 --> 00:36:25,048
And then, it was time for work.

341
00:36:26,773 --> 00:36:29,367
The moment she would sit
at the piano. . .

342
00:36:30,453 --> 00:36:32,330
. . .we were all business.

343
00:36:34,013 --> 00:36:35,890
And l would give her. . .

344
00:36:36,133 --> 00:36:41,253
. . .her lesson just the same
as all my other pupils.

345
00:36:42,613 --> 00:36:45,730
And it was no ''Grandma'' this
or ''Grandma'' that.

346
00:36:51,013 --> 00:36:53,243
But the moment we were done. . .

347
00:36:53,493 --> 00:36:54,972
. . .she was my Ginny again.

348
00:36:58,213 --> 00:37:01,046
How could God be so greedy?

349
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:03,611
Ma'am, l. . . .

350
00:37:11,053 --> 00:37:12,884
And after the lesson?

351
00:37:14,773 --> 00:37:16,172
Cookies.

352
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:21,163
We would have cookies,
if l'd baked them.

353
00:37:21,613 --> 00:37:24,730
Sometimes l would send her down
to the Land of Christmas. . .

354
00:37:24,973 --> 00:37:28,488
. . .the store downstairs,
for candy or ice cream.

355
00:37:28,773 --> 00:37:32,925
She would eat her sweets
and l would read to her.

356
00:37:34,053 --> 00:37:36,123
She loved Andersen.

357
00:37:37,253 --> 00:37:38,322
Who?

358
00:37:38,973 --> 00:37:42,682
Do you know what he wrote
in his story ''The Angel''?

359
00:37:44,253 --> 00:37:45,368
No.

360
00:37:49,693 --> 00:37:50,648
Here.

361
00:37:55,733 --> 00:37:59,692
''Whenever a good child dies. . .

362
00:37:59,933 --> 00:38:02,242
. . .an angel of God. . .

363
00:38:02,493 --> 00:38:05,451
. . .comes down from Heaven. . .

364
00:38:05,693 --> 00:38:08,526
. . .and takes the child in his arms.

365
00:38:09,333 --> 00:38:13,008
And spreads out his great white wings.

366
00:38:13,493 --> 00:38:15,768
And flies with her. . .

367
00:38:16,573 --> 00:38:19,133
. . .over all the places. . .

368
00:38:19,373 --> 00:38:22,285
. . .that she loved during her life.

369
00:38:23,413 --> 00:38:26,291
And then, the child carries. . .

370
00:38:29,253 --> 00:38:31,926
. . .a large handful of flowers. . .

371
00:38:32,733 --> 00:38:34,564
. . .up to God. ''

372
00:38:43,213 --> 00:38:44,441
Beautiful.

373
00:39:01,693 --> 00:39:03,126
What's your name?

374
00:39:04,293 --> 00:39:06,648
Becky. Becky Fiske.

375
00:39:07,613 --> 00:39:09,808
And you were Ginny's best friend?

376
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:12,645
We sat together.

377
00:39:13,253 --> 00:39:14,481
She died.

378
00:39:15,573 --> 00:39:17,689
Yeah. l know.

379
00:39:19,813 --> 00:39:24,443
Her grandmother told me
that Ginny liked to tell stories.

380
00:39:26,253 --> 00:39:27,686
Sometimes.

381
00:39:30,573 --> 00:39:32,450
What kind of stories?

382
00:39:33,733 --> 00:39:36,122
Ginny knew a giant.

383
00:39:37,293 --> 00:39:38,521
Giant?

384
00:39:40,573 --> 00:39:41,688
Really?

385
00:39:42,613 --> 00:39:47,004
He was as big as a mountain
and gave her porcupines.

386
00:39:47,493 --> 00:39:50,246
She called him ''The Wizard. ''

387
00:39:51,453 --> 00:39:53,125
Ginny made a picture of him.

388
00:39:57,213 --> 00:39:59,443
Ginny drew a picture of a giant?

389
00:40:00,573 --> 00:40:02,052
Can l see it?

390
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:04,289
lt's on the wall in the hallway.

391
00:40:04,653 --> 00:40:06,530
We put Ginny's picture--

392
00:40:10,213 --> 00:40:11,612
l gotta go.

393
00:41:19,693 --> 00:41:21,331
Jean, hold my calls.

394
00:41:51,693 --> 00:41:54,048
You were supposed to be
fishing in Mexico.

395
00:41:57,053 --> 00:41:58,691
l know, Stan.

396
00:41:59,813 --> 00:42:01,804
l went to the airport.

397
00:42:02,533 --> 00:42:04,683
l heard the boarding announcement.

398
00:42:06,653 --> 00:42:08,450
l just didn't feel right.

399
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:14,369
Something went off.
l need more time on this.

400
00:42:17,333 --> 00:42:20,131
You want me to reopen a case
because you got a hunch?

401
00:42:22,773 --> 00:42:25,970
No offense, but you're retired.
You don't work here anymore.

402
00:42:29,653 --> 00:42:30,972
Okay.

403
00:42:31,333 --> 00:42:33,005
l know, Stan.

404
00:42:33,333 --> 00:42:37,611
l know. But could you run it
through the system for me anyway?

405
00:42:37,853 --> 00:42:39,571
You know, just a standard query.

406
00:42:39,813 --> 00:42:42,646
Similar crimes, profile, victims.

407
00:42:44,573 --> 00:42:45,722
Could you?

408
00:42:47,333 --> 00:42:48,686
Say, for. . .

409
00:42:55,333 --> 00:42:57,642
. . .the last 10, 12 years.

410
00:42:58,333 --> 00:42:59,846
Could you, Stan?

411
00:43:07,693 --> 00:43:08,921
Please?

412
00:44:02,493 --> 00:44:04,882
This is eight years ago
when this happened.

413
00:44:06,133 --> 00:44:10,445
l'm on the job only six months
when this very big deal goes down.

414
00:44:10,973 --> 00:44:13,282
Talk about baptism by fire.

415
00:44:13,813 --> 00:44:15,531
And to top off everything else. . .

416
00:44:15,773 --> 00:44:17,286
. . .it was in the summer season.

417
00:44:17,533 --> 00:44:19,728
''Politics of tourism''
and all that nonsense.

418
00:44:19,973 --> 00:44:24,205
So we all feel the pressure to make
the bogeyman of it all disappear.

419
00:44:24,453 --> 00:44:26,808
The brass were pretty clear
in the presumption. . .

420
00:44:27,053 --> 00:44:29,089
. . .that it was one
of those festival-goers. . .

421
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:32,530
. . .which seemed like, you know,
a pretty good bet.

422
00:44:32,773 --> 00:44:36,129
And a good way to diffuse
the kind of panic that you get. . .

423
00:44:36,373 --> 00:44:39,126
. . .when they feel that there's
a bogeyman amongst them.

424
00:44:39,373 --> 00:44:40,806
So we all figured. . .

425
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:45,729
. . .and l do feel accurately,
that's why we never did catch him.

426
00:44:47,773 --> 00:44:51,049
The odds were on a perpetrator. . .

427
00:44:51,293 --> 00:44:55,047
. . .who'd cleared the county
before the body was ever found.

428
00:44:56,133 --> 00:44:57,361
Yeah.

429
00:44:59,653 --> 00:45:01,803
Look at the slit in that neck.

430
00:45:02,053 --> 00:45:03,884
l don't know, but for me. . .

431
00:45:06,133 --> 00:45:07,771
. . .it's like being in a movie.

432
00:45:08,893 --> 00:45:12,283
This stuff just doesn't bother me
like it does some people. You?

433
00:45:14,613 --> 00:45:16,171
Luanne Rotze.

434
00:45:16,413 --> 00:45:18,290
A little 10-year-old girl.

435
00:45:18,813 --> 00:45:21,725
Real little.
l mean, real small for her age.

436
00:45:21,973 --> 00:45:23,452
You know what, though?

437
00:45:23,933 --> 00:45:26,447
As horrible as that
kind of thing is. . .

438
00:45:26,693 --> 00:45:28,968
. . .l got an adrenaline rush
being part of it.

439
00:45:29,613 --> 00:45:32,525
l don't know if that's bad,
but, hey, don't hurt me.

440
00:45:32,773 --> 00:45:34,491
That's just the way it hit me.

441
00:45:35,133 --> 00:45:37,601
Nothing like it
ever happened before here.

442
00:45:38,213 --> 00:45:41,125
By the way, nothing like it
ever happened since.

443
00:45:41,373 --> 00:45:42,692
l think that says a lot.

444
00:45:44,573 --> 00:45:47,610
-You mind if l keep this one?
-l couldn't let you do that.

445
00:45:47,933 --> 00:45:49,491
We always like to be of help. . .

446
00:45:49,733 --> 00:45:52,691
. . .but, strictly technically,
the case is still open.

447
00:45:53,653 --> 00:45:55,609
Well, then, how about the report?

448
00:45:58,053 --> 00:45:59,930
l'll make you a copy. How's that?

449
00:46:00,653 --> 00:46:02,450
Sure would appreciate it.

450
00:46:02,693 --> 00:46:04,411
But keep it between us.

451
00:46:04,653 --> 00:46:08,043
l'm not sure what the policy is
on this kind of thing. Okay?

452
00:46:08,893 --> 00:46:10,372
My lips are sealed.

453
00:46:12,133 --> 00:46:13,452
Lucy!

454
00:46:14,293 --> 00:46:17,285
A young horse is like a woman.
Can't predict what they'll do.

455
00:46:17,533 --> 00:46:18,852
They're crazy.

456
00:46:25,893 --> 00:46:27,724
Excuse me. Sir?

457
00:46:27,973 --> 00:46:28,883
Sir?

458
00:46:29,133 --> 00:46:33,172
l wonder if you could tell me where
a man named James Olstad might be?

459
00:46:33,413 --> 00:46:35,404
Olstad's not a patient here.

460
00:46:36,493 --> 00:46:38,609
Well, l believe he's
the custodian, sir.

461
00:46:38,853 --> 00:46:41,083
ln the building, mopping?
He's not a patient.

462
00:46:41,333 --> 00:46:43,369
-Mopping in the building?
-Not a patient.

463
00:47:06,859 --> 00:47:08,338
James Olstad?

464
00:47:14,339 --> 00:47:17,649
l'm Jerry Black.
l'm a police detective.

465
00:47:17,899 --> 00:47:22,256
l'd just like to talk to you
about your daughter.

466
00:47:24,539 --> 00:47:25,858
What daughter?

467
00:47:27,699 --> 00:47:31,772
You did have a daughter that went
missing three years ago, didn't you?

468
00:47:33,499 --> 00:47:37,811
Did you come here to tell me
that something happened to her?

469
00:47:38,059 --> 00:47:39,014
No, sir. lt was--

470
00:47:39,259 --> 00:47:41,250
Did you find her dead or something?

471
00:47:42,979 --> 00:47:45,049
No. No, sir.

472
00:47:46,379 --> 00:47:48,495
We're still trying to find her.

473
00:47:52,419 --> 00:47:54,774
Anything you might tell me about her?

474
00:47:55,019 --> 00:47:56,771
Could you describe her?

475
00:48:01,259 --> 00:48:02,977
She must be--

476
00:48:07,179 --> 00:48:09,249
She must be different now.

477
00:48:14,619 --> 00:48:16,416
She was so pretty.

478
00:48:25,339 --> 00:48:27,614
l miss her so much!

479
00:48:33,059 --> 00:48:36,449
We just used to, like,
hold each other.

480
00:48:39,459 --> 00:48:42,132
l was supposed to take care of her.

481
00:48:42,379 --> 00:48:45,371
She was my little girl, you know?

482
00:48:45,859 --> 00:48:47,417
l just--

483
00:48:57,659 --> 00:48:59,456
l had my little girl.

484
00:49:03,019 --> 00:49:04,771
Where is my baby?

485
00:49:06,539 --> 00:49:09,895
The break is Monash County.
Eight years ago, we got a homicide.

486
00:49:10,339 --> 00:49:11,249
Same M.O.

487
00:49:11,499 --> 00:49:15,572
Exact same victim profile
description as the Ginny Larsen case.

488
00:49:16,339 --> 00:49:18,978
l interviewed a local officer
for the particulars.

489
00:49:19,419 --> 00:49:23,935
Little blonde girl, 10 years old,
sexual assault, throat slit.

490
00:49:24,539 --> 00:49:27,497
The photos show that
she was wearing a red dress.

491
00:49:29,339 --> 00:49:34,129
Detectives out at Morehead covered
this case. The case is still open.

492
00:49:34,379 --> 00:49:36,415
At the time of the murders. . .

493
00:49:36,739 --> 00:49:39,890
. . .Toby Wadenah was
in Stillwater Penitentiary. . .

494
00:49:40,139 --> 00:49:42,334
. . .doing time on his
own rape conviction.

495
00:49:42,579 --> 00:49:45,013
-He couldn't have done it.
-He shot himself.

496
00:49:45,259 --> 00:49:47,090
-What more--
-You told him what he did.

497
00:49:47,339 --> 00:49:50,376
Let's calm down, see what Jerry's got.
You got something?

498
00:49:50,619 --> 00:49:53,053
And there's more. More.

499
00:49:53,299 --> 00:49:55,096
Here. See here?

500
00:49:55,339 --> 00:49:59,776
This is the Larsen murder. This is
the Monash County girl. And here:

501
00:50:00,499 --> 00:50:02,251
Here, you see this pattern?

502
00:50:02,539 --> 00:50:05,895
Three years ago, l got a girl gone
missing, Cathy Olstad.

503
00:50:06,139 --> 00:50:09,575
Same exact description, a little
blonde girl, 9 years old. . .

504
00:50:09,819 --> 00:50:13,573
. . .last seen wearing a red dress.

505
00:50:18,139 --> 00:50:19,128
And?

506
00:50:20,379 --> 00:50:21,653
And?

507
00:50:24,419 --> 00:50:25,374
Don't you see?

508
00:50:25,619 --> 00:50:28,736
l see a description that fits
a number of juvenile murders.

509
00:50:28,979 --> 00:50:32,130
And a victim profile that matches
every other in the state. . .

510
00:50:32,379 --> 00:50:34,017
. . .give or take the red dress.

511
00:50:34,259 --> 00:50:37,934
Why didn't you mention her blue eyes
while you're at it? Come on!

512
00:50:38,179 --> 00:50:40,135
l mean, whatever made you think. . .

513
00:50:40,379 --> 00:50:43,371
. . .that the Larsen girl
wasn't murdered by Wadenah?

514
00:50:44,379 --> 00:50:45,573
This did.

515
00:50:46,459 --> 00:50:47,938
This convinced me.

516
00:50:48,179 --> 00:50:52,411
Ginny's drawing
of the Porcupine Giant.

517
00:50:52,819 --> 00:50:56,573
l have reason to believe, based on
my conversations and interviews. . .

518
00:50:57,259 --> 00:51:01,411
. . .that Ginny Larsen made this drawing
just days before she was murdered.

519
00:51:01,659 --> 00:51:04,173
l have reason to believe
she met with this man. . .

520
00:51:04,419 --> 00:51:08,173
. . .seen here as a giant, all dressed
in black, on a regular basis.

521
00:51:08,419 --> 00:51:12,298
This is not an lndian.
This is not an lndian type.

522
00:51:12,539 --> 00:51:15,497
And you see this car here?
This big, black car?

523
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:16,933
This is not a truck.

524
00:51:17,179 --> 00:51:20,251
This is not a maroon truck
like Wadenah drove.

525
00:51:20,499 --> 00:51:23,252
This is a big, black station wagon.

526
00:51:23,499 --> 00:51:26,297
And these right here,
according to an interview l had. . .

527
00:51:26,539 --> 00:51:30,293
. . .with a girl named Beck--
Betsy Fiske. . .

528
00:51:30,539 --> 00:51:32,928
-. . .these are porcupines.
-Okay. Whoa! Hold it.

529
00:51:33,179 --> 00:51:35,409
Porcupines and giants and--

530
00:51:35,659 --> 00:51:38,173
You got to get ahold
of yourself, Jerry.

531
00:51:38,419 --> 00:51:40,410
The case is closed.

532
00:51:42,299 --> 00:51:44,130
l made a promise.

533
00:51:45,019 --> 00:51:48,568
l made a promise to find. . .

534
00:51:50,059 --> 00:51:52,289
. . .Ginny Larsen's murderer.

535
00:51:52,979 --> 00:51:54,617
l intend to keep it.

536
00:52:07,779 --> 00:52:09,656
Listen, Jerry.

537
00:52:12,059 --> 00:52:14,937
You gotta start getting on
with your life, you know?

538
00:52:16,499 --> 00:52:20,378
l mean, sometimes when you
go through big changes. . .

539
00:52:20,619 --> 00:52:22,416
. . .and retirement's one of them. . .

540
00:52:22,659 --> 00:52:25,412
. . .it can cause a lot of added stress.

541
00:52:26,579 --> 00:52:28,729
Sometimes it's a good idea just to. . .

542
00:52:29,379 --> 00:52:31,654
. . .talk to someone.
You know, someone. . .

543
00:52:32,579 --> 00:52:33,614
. . .professional.

544
00:52:34,299 --> 00:52:35,971
l made a promise, Eric.

545
00:52:36,219 --> 00:52:39,177
You're old enough to remember
when that meant something.

546
00:52:47,779 --> 00:52:49,451
Get a life.

547
00:53:36,779 --> 00:53:39,498
Jerry, got your fresh towels here!

548
00:53:40,219 --> 00:53:42,016
Most don't need them every day.

549
00:53:42,259 --> 00:53:46,172
Please don't get them so dirty
they're not to be white again.

550
00:53:46,419 --> 00:53:49,775
Here's your nice little sunroom.
You can smoke in here.

551
00:53:50,019 --> 00:53:53,216
This is the living room area.
No partying, please, no.

552
00:53:53,459 --> 00:53:56,132
Kitchen, of course.
All the amenities of home.

553
00:53:56,379 --> 00:54:00,088
Bedroom. We just got a new mattress,
so it should be really comfy.

554
00:54:00,339 --> 00:54:03,331
And oh, yeah, trash goes
in the covered dumpster.

555
00:54:03,579 --> 00:54:08,369
Fish guts you gotta wrap and place in
the pail next to the cleaning station.

556
00:54:08,619 --> 00:54:12,055
Rules and regulations
of Sugar Bush up here. Yep.

557
00:54:12,299 --> 00:54:14,130
And no nude sunbathing.

558
00:54:14,379 --> 00:54:17,257
l'll leave these here
and get Rose to make up your bed.

559
00:54:17,499 --> 00:54:21,128
lf there's anything else you need,
just let me know. Okey-dokey?

560
00:56:41,219 --> 00:56:42,447
Good morning.

561
00:56:44,339 --> 00:56:46,216
l'll have a pack of lights.

562
00:56:51,339 --> 00:56:52,249
That the owner?

563
00:56:52,899 --> 00:56:54,014
My daddy.

564
00:56:55,779 --> 00:56:57,053
What can l do for you?

565
00:56:58,579 --> 00:57:01,047
l was just having a look around.

566
00:57:02,019 --> 00:57:04,055
How long you had this place?

567
00:57:05,139 --> 00:57:06,652
Thirty years.

568
00:57:08,819 --> 00:57:10,730
Ever think about selling it?

569
00:57:11,459 --> 00:57:12,528
No.

570
00:57:13,819 --> 00:57:18,370
Well, what would it take to get
you to think about selling?

571
00:57:18,979 --> 00:57:20,173
lt's not for sale.

572
00:57:23,659 --> 00:57:25,251
l'll tell you what.

573
00:57:27,339 --> 00:57:30,729
l'll give you my number
over where l'm staying. . .

574
00:57:30,979 --> 00:57:34,210
. . .at Thompson's Sugar Bush Resort.

575
00:57:34,499 --> 00:57:36,330
l don't mean to be pushy but. . .

576
00:57:36,899 --> 00:57:38,730
. . .if you'd think about it. . . .

577
00:57:39,779 --> 00:57:43,454
l'll wait to hear from you over at
Thompson's, if it's all right.

578
00:57:44,219 --> 00:57:47,177
-Been a pleasure.
-Thanks for coming in.

579
00:57:47,899 --> 00:57:49,537
Nice place.

580
00:58:12,179 --> 00:58:14,170
You didn't tell me
you were a cop!

581
00:58:14,419 --> 00:58:17,411
-Ex-cop.
-Once a cop. . . .

582
00:58:19,539 --> 00:58:21,131
l'm retired.

583
00:58:21,539 --> 00:58:24,372
What l wanted to tell you was
that Floyd Cage called.

584
00:58:24,619 --> 00:58:28,692
The fellow with the gas station.
He says he wants to talk to you.

585
00:58:29,739 --> 00:58:31,331
l see they're biting.

586
00:58:32,419 --> 00:58:35,217
You bet. Sure does look like it.

587
00:58:35,459 --> 00:58:38,053
You can use the phone
up in the front cabin here.

588
00:58:38,299 --> 00:58:39,652
Thank you.

589
00:58:55,379 --> 00:58:59,736
Floyd, Jerry signed all the papers.
You're ready to go.

590
00:59:00,139 --> 00:59:02,448
l sure appreciate it.
You've done a good job.

591
00:59:02,699 --> 00:59:03,449
Good luck.

592
00:59:04,859 --> 00:59:08,249
When we get a number down in Arizona,
we'll give you a call.

593
00:59:08,499 --> 00:59:09,818
l'm going to Arizona!

594
00:59:10,059 --> 00:59:11,287
Call if you forget something. . .

595

. . .or want to know where something is,
or whatever. . . .

596
00:59:14,939 --> 00:59:16,577
-Good luck to you.
-Thank you.

597
00:59:23,619 --> 00:59:25,098
l hope you'll be happy here. . .

598
00:59:25,339 --> 00:59:29,969
. . .cause you're never gonna be able
to sell it for what you paid.

599
00:59:30,619 --> 00:59:32,610
Thank you, l'll do my best.

600
00:59:32,859 --> 00:59:34,372

601
00:59:35,619 --> 00:59:38,577

602
01:01:00,899 --> 01:01:02,890
-l'll be right with you.
-Thank you.

603
01:01:07,659 --> 01:01:08,978
What can l get you?

604
01:01:09,659 --> 01:01:11,297
Just a beer, thanks.

605
01:01:12,939 --> 01:01:15,169
You the cop
who bought the gas station?

606
01:01:15,419 --> 01:01:17,933
l'm retired from
the police department.

607
01:01:19,899 --> 01:01:22,049
And you bought Floyd's station?

608
01:01:25,179 --> 01:01:26,055
l did.

609
01:01:26,579 --> 01:01:29,491
That's a strange thing to do.
You must be an angler.

610
01:01:29,739 --> 01:01:33,414
-How'd you guess?
-Nothing else to do around here.

611
01:01:33,939 --> 01:01:35,372
Yeah.

612
01:01:58,179 --> 01:02:00,135
Sorry about that.

613
01:02:02,259 --> 01:02:05,217
These things only work half the time.

614
01:02:10,899 --> 01:02:12,855
Sign right there for me,
if you would.

615
01:02:15,059 --> 01:02:16,731
That's for you.

616
01:02:31,459 --> 01:02:32,448
Thank you and. . .

617
01:02:32,699 --> 01:02:35,771
-. . .here's your receipt.
-Thank you, sir. Have a good day.

618
01:03:12,339 --> 01:03:14,455
All right, 10 regular.

619
01:03:16,259 --> 01:03:20,013
Nice wagon. Sticks out around here,
doesn't it?

620
01:03:20,259 --> 01:03:21,612
Never thought about it.

621
01:03:21,859 --> 01:03:24,657
Just know to get them black,
don't show dirt as much.

622
01:03:28,179 --> 01:03:31,535
Ten it is. Thanks for stopping by.

623
01:04:02,499 --> 01:04:05,775
Whenever a good child dies...

624
01:04:06,019 --> 01:04:09,375
...an angel of God
comes down from Heaven...

625
01:04:09,619 --> 01:04:12,577
...and takes the dead child
in his arms.

626
01:04:12,819 --> 01:04:16,698
And spreads out
his great white wings...

627
01:04:16,939 --> 01:04:18,531
...and flies with her...

628
01:04:18,779 --> 01:04:22,772
...over all the places
that she loved in her life.

629
01:04:35,739 --> 01:04:38,207
And what do you feel
is represented here?

630
01:04:39,459 --> 01:04:43,293
Well, the porcupine giant:
Ginny told her friends. . .

631
01:04:43,539 --> 01:04:45,928
. . .that she'd meet with
a giant in the forest. . .

632
01:04:46,179 --> 01:04:48,488
. . .and that he gave her
little porcupines.

633
01:04:48,739 --> 01:04:50,411
-What do you mean?
-You see these--

634
01:04:50,659 --> 01:04:52,411
What do you mean by ''porcupines''?

635
01:04:52,659 --> 01:04:54,331
l don't know exactly. . .

636
01:04:54,579 --> 01:04:57,537
. . .those are the words of
a 7-year-old girl.

637
01:04:57,779 --> 01:05:00,930
Ginny's friends. Friend, sorry.

638
01:05:02,419 --> 01:05:06,935
And this is in the imagination of a
7-year-old girl. Correct?

639
01:05:10,299 --> 01:05:12,688
You could be right. But. . .

640
01:05:12,939 --> 01:05:16,011
. . .on the other hand,
the car is very well depicted. . .

641
01:05:16,259 --> 01:05:19,569
-. . .and the giant is--
-Giants are imaginary.

642
01:05:20,019 --> 01:05:20,895
Yes?

643
01:05:24,299 --> 01:05:27,257
A tall, heavyset man could appear. . .

644
01:05:27,499 --> 01:05:30,332
. . .to be a giant to a little girl.

645
01:05:31,379 --> 01:05:33,370
And the lndian man, was he a tall man?

646
01:05:36,739 --> 01:05:40,812
Not a giant. But tall, yes.

647
01:05:46,739 --> 01:05:49,048
Why did you bring this to me,
Mr. Black?

648
01:05:51,779 --> 01:05:52,894
Sorry?

649
01:05:53,459 --> 01:05:56,053
Why did you bring this to me,
Mr. Black?

650
01:06:01,579 --> 01:06:04,093
l need to know who l'm looking for.

651
01:06:04,339 --> 01:06:07,012
l'm like a layman
looking at an x-ray.

652
01:06:07,339 --> 01:06:11,298
l don't know how to read it.
l need help interpreting it.

653
01:06:11,699 --> 01:06:14,133
This drawing can tell you
nothing about. . .

654
01:06:14,379 --> 01:06:17,530
. . .the murderer. lt only tells you
about the child who drew it.

655
01:06:18,379 --> 01:06:22,930
Without more information, l don't
think l can be of any value to you.

656
01:06:23,179 --> 01:06:25,374
Humor me, doc.

657
01:06:25,619 --> 01:06:30,056
Consider this a working hypothesis
and assume for the moment. . .

658
01:06:30,299 --> 01:06:32,574
. . .that this is a drawing
of the murderer.

659
01:06:37,259 --> 01:06:38,328
Well.

660
01:06:40,539 --> 01:06:43,337
Your giant certainly looks
tall, massive. . .

661
01:06:43,579 --> 01:06:45,251
. . .very imposing.

662
01:06:45,499 --> 01:06:48,809
lf this depicts the relationship
between the giant and the girl. . .

663
01:06:49,059 --> 01:06:50,970
. . .then these things
you call ''porcupines'' . . .

664
01:06:51,219 --> 01:06:53,653
. . .appear to be gifts
that she's accepting.

665
01:06:53,899 --> 01:06:55,412
That's implying a trust.

666
01:06:55,659 --> 01:06:58,014
Was the girl in Monash
killed the same way?

667
01:07:00,859 --> 01:07:02,178
Exactly the same.

668
01:07:02,419 --> 01:07:04,569
Do the victims resemble one another?

669
01:07:07,179 --> 01:07:08,578
Yes, a lot.

670
01:07:08,819 --> 01:07:11,492
What were the time intervals
between the murders?

671
01:07:12,299 --> 01:07:16,133
The Monash County case was
eight years ago.

672
01:07:16,379 --> 01:07:17,812
The little girl missing, three.

673
01:07:18,059 --> 01:07:21,893
And Ginny was just. . . .
Just last winter.

674
01:07:22,139 --> 01:07:24,289
So the intervals are getting shorter.

675
01:07:26,459 --> 01:07:29,212
lf that's the case, then yes,
you could--

676
01:07:29,459 --> 01:07:31,495
Remember, this is a hypothetical case.

677
01:07:32,179 --> 01:07:35,410
But yes, you could expect
another incident within. . .

678
01:07:35,659 --> 01:07:37,058
. . .a matter of months.

679
01:07:37,659 --> 01:07:40,617
Maybe a year,
if the opportunity arose.

680
01:07:41,219 --> 01:07:43,210
But this could just be a product. . .

681
01:07:43,459 --> 01:07:46,132
. . .of a 7-year-old child's
imagination.

682
01:07:51,939 --> 01:07:53,054
Right.

683
01:08:00,259 --> 01:08:02,250
You came to me for help.

684
01:08:03,259 --> 01:08:06,535
-Yes.
-Mind if l ask you some questions?

685
01:08:08,299 --> 01:08:09,493
Shoot.

686
01:08:10,899 --> 01:08:12,457
You recently retired, right?

687
01:08:14,659 --> 01:08:15,978
Yes.

688
01:08:17,939 --> 01:08:20,248
Have you always been a chainsmoker?

689
01:08:20,939 --> 01:08:24,773
Impossible.
There can 't be such a devil.

690
01:08:25,379 --> 01:08:29,691
-You always been a chainsmoker?
-Yes, there are such devils.

691
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:31,895
Recent. Recent.

692
01:08:33,979 --> 01:08:36,539
-Do you swear...
-Are you still sexually active?

693
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:38,531
...by your soul's salvation....

694
01:08:39,059 --> 01:08:40,492
Are you still sexually active?

695
01:08:41,739 --> 01:08:43,457
Are you still sexually active?

696
01:08:44,139 --> 01:08:47,654
-Yes, by my soul's salvation....
-Does that embarrass you?

697
01:08:48,739 --> 01:08:49,854
Experienced any. . . .

698
01:08:51,499 --> 01:08:54,218
Have you experienced
any sudden fevers, perspiration?

699
01:08:55,419 --> 01:08:57,808
-No.
-Get ahold of yourself, Jerry!

700
01:08:58,179 --> 01:08:59,692
Or voices.
Do you hear voices?

701
01:08:59,939 --> 01:09:03,295
-I kill the girl. I kill the girl.
-No, goddamn it! No!

702
01:09:49,619 --> 01:09:53,248
--Lucky West's prescription is
that with the predatory fish...

703
01:09:53,499 --> 01:09:55,729
... your best bet's live bait.

704
01:09:55,979 --> 01:09:58,732
Here you see Kwan Lee,
who 's gone from worms...

705
01:09:58,979 --> 01:10:00,776
... to the little fishies.

706
01:10:02,859 --> 01:10:04,736
Where are those pancakes?

707
01:10:10,379 --> 01:10:14,008
-Don't forget your orange juice, baby.
-Can l get a touchup, please?

708
01:10:16,899 --> 01:10:20,335
-Thanks, doll.
-l could use a little fresh-up too.

709
01:10:23,699 --> 01:10:27,009
Boy. Nice picture.

710
01:10:29,219 --> 01:10:30,538
Thank you.

711
01:10:33,059 --> 01:10:36,688
Aren't you gonna finish
your orange juice?

712
01:10:36,939 --> 01:10:38,452
Mommy.

713
01:10:39,179 --> 01:10:41,568
Hi, officer. lt's okay, honey,
he's a friend.

714
01:10:41,819 --> 01:10:44,379
Pack up, 'cause the bus is coming.
Any coffee?

715
01:10:44,619 --> 01:10:46,018
Yes, please.

716
01:10:54,939 --> 01:10:57,976
What name would a pretty little
girl like you have?

717
01:10:58,219 --> 01:10:58,969
Chrissy.

718
01:11:01,539 --> 01:11:02,813
That's a nice name.

719
01:11:03,299 --> 01:11:06,291
Okay, love bug, this is it.
Come on, let's go.

720
01:11:06,579 --> 01:11:08,217
Bye. Can l have a hug?

721
01:11:09,219 --> 01:11:10,493
Have a good day.

722
01:11:17,899 --> 01:11:20,618
-Beautiful little girl.
-Thank you.

723
01:11:21,379 --> 01:11:22,494
How old is she?

724
01:11:22,739 --> 01:11:27,335
She'll be 8 next month.
First day of school's always a biggie.

725
01:11:27,979 --> 01:11:30,447
-Oh, l forgot your coffee.
-Thank you.

726
01:11:46,419 --> 01:11:47,568
Thank you very much.

727
01:11:56,739 --> 01:11:59,094
-There you go.
-Thank you.

728
01:11:59,339 --> 01:12:00,692
-Want some breakfast?
-Yeah.

729
01:12:02,499 --> 01:12:04,649
l'd like bacon and eggs and--

730
01:12:05,019 --> 01:12:08,409
-How do you like your eggs?
-Over easy. And rye toast.

731
01:12:08,699 --> 01:12:11,418
-Okay.
-l got a question for you.

732
01:12:12,019 --> 01:12:12,929
Fire away.

733
01:12:13,219 --> 01:12:16,495
Where would an old bachelor like me
find some used furniture?

734
01:12:16,739 --> 01:12:20,414
Nothing too fancy, you know.
A couch, dinette set. . .

735
01:12:20,659 --> 01:12:25,289
. . .something between not-too-expensive
and poverty-stricken range.

736
01:12:25,899 --> 01:12:26,695
My range.

737
01:12:27,779 --> 01:12:29,497
There's a flea market up--

738
01:12:29,739 --> 01:12:33,812
You go right up Old Pass Road.
Go north about 25 miles up here. . .

739
01:12:34,059 --> 01:12:36,175
. . .and you're gonna hit a T-junction.

740
01:12:36,459 --> 01:12:40,691
lt's gonna fork into two roads,
two dirt roads. There's no sign--

741
01:12:40,939 --> 01:12:42,770
Do you like shopping?

742
01:12:51,179 --> 01:12:53,977
-Mommy, can l have a balloon?
-Yeah.

743
01:12:54,859 --> 01:12:56,451
-What color?
-Here, l got it.

744
01:12:56,699 --> 01:12:57,973
Orange.

745
01:12:58,219 --> 01:13:01,689
-Orange. There you go.
-Well, you got pink.

746
01:13:01,939 --> 01:13:04,134
-That's okay.
-Pink? l like pink too.

747
01:13:04,379 --> 01:13:06,847
-Thank you.
-Thank you very much.

748
01:13:09,259 --> 01:13:11,693
l'm looking for Formica here.

749
01:13:13,259 --> 01:13:15,614
-lt wipes easy.
-That won't be a problem.

750
01:13:24,659 --> 01:13:28,732
-What about this one right here?
-lt gives a room a very warm feeling.

751
01:13:29,259 --> 01:13:32,649
-This one's oak veneer.
-Veneer, huh?

752
01:13:33,259 --> 01:13:37,616
-l can take $5 off the top.
-What would that bring the total to?

753
01:13:45,539 --> 01:13:46,494
Where's Chrissy?

754
01:13:47,619 --> 01:13:48,654
-Chrissy?
-Where is she?

755
01:13:48,899 --> 01:13:51,254
-She was just right here.
-Chrissy!

756
01:13:51,499 --> 01:13:52,375
l'll come back.

757
01:13:52,619 --> 01:13:53,529
Chrissy!

758
01:13:56,539 --> 01:13:57,449
Chrissy!

759
01:14:10,379 --> 01:14:11,528
She's on the swing.

760
01:14:17,019 --> 01:14:19,249
-Bye.
-Chrissy!

761
01:14:22,819 --> 01:14:27,256
-Don't leave me like that.
-Mommy, that girl gave this to me.

762
01:14:27,499 --> 01:14:28,614
lsn't it cute?

763
01:14:28,859 --> 01:14:30,338
-What is it?
-A boot cleaner. . .

764
01:14:30,579 --> 01:14:34,538
. . .in the shape of a porcupine.
lt's made by a local craft artist.

765
01:14:34,779 --> 01:14:38,613
She makes doormats too.
You want to come see?

766
01:14:46,699 --> 01:14:50,009
Fifteen apiece for the little fellas,
25 for the big.

767
01:14:50,259 --> 01:14:53,331
The mats are 10 bucks even.

768
01:14:56,379 --> 01:14:59,291
You don't run this whole place
yourself, do you?

769
01:14:59,539 --> 01:15:02,212
Are you a religious man, Mr. Black?

770
01:15:02,699 --> 01:15:05,213
Baptized. But l'm not churchgoing.

771
01:15:05,779 --> 01:15:06,894
You got a wife?

772
01:15:07,619 --> 01:15:10,816
Two-time loser.
What about you, ma'am?

773
01:15:11,299 --> 01:15:14,575
My son, Gary, is the true gift
of the Lord.

774
01:15:14,819 --> 01:15:17,208
He dotes on me hand and foot, he does.

775
01:15:17,539 --> 01:15:19,291
Hardest working boy you ever saw.

776
01:15:19,539 --> 01:15:21,575
Works construction all summer. . .

777
01:15:21,819 --> 01:15:24,333
. . .runs a snowplow for the county
in the winter. . .

778
01:15:24,579 --> 01:15:26,217
. . .and ministers at our church.

779
01:15:30,179 --> 01:15:33,455
What about him?
Does he have a family, kids?

780
01:15:33,699 --> 01:15:36,532
No wife, no kids. No little ones.

781
01:15:36,779 --> 01:15:39,532
I pray, every day...

782
01:15:39,779 --> 01:15:42,247
...he'll find a woman
good enough for him.

783
01:15:42,499 --> 01:15:44,888
The Lord hasn 't come through yet.

784
01:16:13,219 --> 01:16:14,652
God bless.

785
01:17:16,979 --> 01:17:18,173
Closed!

786
01:17:23,779 --> 01:17:25,610
l'm closed!

787
01:17:33,659 --> 01:17:35,729
Yeah, all right, all right.

788
01:17:39,499 --> 01:17:41,012
Closed.

789
01:17:43,979 --> 01:17:45,048
Lori?

790
01:17:46,579 --> 01:17:49,218
Woman, what has happened to you?
Come in.

791
01:17:49,459 --> 01:17:50,528
Sorry. . . .

792
01:17:50,819 --> 01:17:55,176
My ex-- l was just so scared.
He was gonna kill me!

793
01:17:55,419 --> 01:17:57,057
lt's all right.

794
01:17:57,499 --> 01:17:59,569
-And you being a cop!
-Where's Chrissy?

795
01:17:59,819 --> 01:18:01,969
-She's in the car!
-No, no, l got it.

796
01:18:02,219 --> 01:18:05,814
She's okay, he didn't touch her.
He didn't touch her, he didn't. . . .

797
01:18:10,819 --> 01:18:13,936
With a restraining order,
he's still gonna beat me up.

798
01:18:14,179 --> 01:18:17,455
They put him in jail and he
can't pay child support payments.

799
01:18:17,699 --> 01:18:20,088
That's why he's beating me up
to begin with.

800
01:18:20,339 --> 01:18:21,488
Ow.

801
01:18:22,699 --> 01:18:24,735
Just hold still.

802
01:18:26,499 --> 01:18:28,694
All right, this might. . . .

803
01:18:29,819 --> 01:18:31,935
All right, that's okay now.

804
01:18:32,179 --> 01:18:36,457
Hold still for a minute because
this one might sting a little, okay?

805
01:18:36,699 --> 01:18:37,927
Just hold still.

806
01:18:39,779 --> 01:18:41,497
Right here, that's it.

807
01:18:43,619 --> 01:18:45,689
All right, all right, okay.

808
01:18:47,419 --> 01:18:48,613
Yeah.

809
01:18:51,899 --> 01:18:53,810
The eye looks okay.

810
01:18:55,059 --> 01:18:59,496
You might want to think about
getting a stitch on that lip.

811
01:19:01,219 --> 01:19:04,131
l'm gonna miss that
half-tooth of yours.

812
01:19:09,339 --> 01:19:11,534
l'll drink out of this side
for a while.

813
01:19:15,179 --> 01:19:16,407
Listen.

814
01:19:20,659 --> 01:19:22,536
All things considered. . .

815
01:19:22,779 --> 01:19:27,057
. . .l think it might be best
if you and your girl. . .

816
01:19:27,299 --> 01:19:29,574
. . .stayed out here with me
for a while.

817
01:19:29,819 --> 01:19:31,571
-lt's not why l came.
-Hear me out.

818
01:19:31,899 --> 01:19:35,858
No strings attached, no obligations.

819
01:19:36,579 --> 01:19:40,174
But l've seen these things
go from bad to worse.

820
01:19:41,619 --> 01:19:45,976
l've got more rooms out here
than l know what to do with.

821
01:19:46,219 --> 01:19:47,937
l wouldn't ask anything of you.

822
01:19:48,179 --> 01:19:51,137
Except maybe help out
around the station. . .

823
01:19:51,379 --> 01:19:54,496
. . .every once in a while, when
you're feeling better.

824
01:20:01,299 --> 01:20:02,971
Just think about it.

825
01:20:03,779 --> 01:20:05,417
Just think about it.

826
01:20:09,419 --> 01:20:12,491
Mine's up here at the top. . . .

827
01:20:15,459 --> 01:20:18,212
Mommy, this house is so big!

828
01:20:20,259 --> 01:20:22,614
-You got a whole new one, right?
-Yeah--

829
01:20:22,859 --> 01:20:24,008
ls it real?

830
01:20:24,259 --> 01:20:28,252
-lt's not real. lt's called a cap.
-Oh.

831
01:20:54,539 --> 01:20:58,452
--in front! It appears that
they're playing very cautiously.

832
01:20:58,699 --> 01:21:02,214
-Is that because it's a big game?
-The last time these two teams--

833
01:21:26,379 --> 01:21:29,610
Pass to Murphy, in the net!
Backhand deflected by Jackson.

834
01:21:29,859 --> 01:21:30,814
Another backhand--

835
01:21:44,139 --> 01:21:46,016
Nice snowman you got going there.

836
01:21:50,939 --> 01:21:52,258
Does he have a name?

837
01:21:55,219 --> 01:21:56,493
Should l guess?

838
01:21:59,379 --> 01:22:01,370
lf l guess, will you tell me yours?

839
01:22:04,699 --> 01:22:06,974
He looks cold.
Want to put my hat on him?

840
01:22:19,339 --> 01:22:20,567
Goal!

841
01:22:37,539 --> 01:22:39,655
Has your mommy talked to you
about the Word?

842
01:22:41,819 --> 01:22:43,013
Do you know what l mean?

843
01:23:49,859 --> 01:23:52,453
-Merry Christmas, Chrissy.
-Merry Christmas.

844
01:23:53,979 --> 01:23:55,890
There she is!

845
01:23:57,899 --> 01:23:59,696
Yeah!

846
01:24:01,179 --> 01:24:02,931
-How was it?
-Good.

847
01:24:03,179 --> 01:24:04,248
Good!

848
01:24:06,819 --> 01:24:10,653
''She knew the mole would never
permit her to leave his side.

849
01:24:10,899 --> 01:24:14,096
She wept as she felt the warmth
upon her face. . .

850
01:24:14,339 --> 01:24:16,728
. . .and made ready to go back. . . .

851
01:24:18,259 --> 01:24:21,968
Then suddenly, above the hill,
she heard a shower of notes. . .

852
01:24:22,219 --> 01:24:25,655
. . .a glorious morning song.
She looked up. . .

853
01:24:25,899 --> 01:24:28,413
. . .and there was the swallow.

854
01:24:28,659 --> 01:24:30,809
She told the bird how she disliked. . .

855
01:24:31,059 --> 01:24:35,575
. . .having to marry the ugly mole
and live deep down under the earth. . .

856
01:24:35,819 --> 01:24:37,571
. . .where the sun never shone.

857
01:24:37,819 --> 01:24:40,413
She couldn't help crying
at the thought.

858
01:24:40,659 --> 01:24:43,571
'The cold winter will soon
be here,' said the swallow.

859
01:24:43,819 --> 01:24:47,494
'l'm going far away to the warm
countries. Will you come with me?

860
01:24:47,739 --> 01:24:51,891
You can sit on my back.
Just tie yourself on with your sash. . .

861
01:24:52,139 --> 01:24:55,575
. . .and we'll fly from the ugly mole
and his dingy house. . .

867
01:26:14,019 --> 01:26:15,168
Lori?

868
01:26:38,059 --> 01:26:39,538
Are you all right?

869
01:28:19,659 --> 01:28:20,853
Here, hon.

870
01:28:22,019 --> 01:28:25,978
Chrissy is gonna go nuts when she
sees this. This is so neat, Jerry.

871
01:28:26,219 --> 01:28:27,937
Yeah. She'll like it.

872
01:28:28,179 --> 01:28:29,498
She'll love it.

873
01:28:31,299 --> 01:28:33,938
You sure you want it here,
so close to the road?

874
01:28:34,179 --> 01:28:36,773
We got all that space
back behind the house.

875
01:28:37,019 --> 01:28:39,408
Well, we can see her
right from the station. . .

876
01:28:39,659 --> 01:28:42,014
. . .keep our eye on her, you know?

877
01:28:43,019 --> 01:28:44,134
Out back. . .

878
01:28:44,459 --> 01:28:46,290
. . .there's all that space, you know.

879
01:28:46,539 --> 01:28:48,530
l mean, she could just disappear.

880
01:28:49,899 --> 01:28:50,854
No, you're right.

881
01:28:51,259 --> 01:28:52,408
You think?

882
01:28:52,779 --> 01:28:54,212
You're probably right.

883
01:28:54,699 --> 01:28:55,927
l'll get that.

884
01:28:58,179 --> 01:28:59,931
Yeah, she's gonna love it.

885
01:29:36,819 --> 01:29:38,332
Mommy, l like this one.

Well, it's nice.

888
01:29:43,379 --> 01:29:45,290
Jerry, what do you think of this?

889
01:29:46,899 --> 01:29:48,048
Well, uh. . .

Come on, Tex.

Let's have three of them.

He invited me to his church.
You think Mommy will let me go?

Well, honey, you know. . .

. . .a lot of people believe
a lot of different things.

Some people believe that the stories
in the Bible are real. . .

tales where the giants aren't real.

01:33:23,699 --> 01:33:26,418
Chrissy, l want you
to promise me something.

When anybody tries
to talk to you, any man. . .

Could you push me on the swings now?

Oh, wow!

-What? Jerry!
-No, l--

For God's sakes, it's just church.

946
01:35:14,659 --> 01:35:16,889
You're gonna give yourself
a heart attack!

947
01:35:55,979 --> 01:35:56,934
Come on!

948
01:37:01,699 --> 01:37:02,848
Oh, God, no!

949
01:37:20,499 --> 01:37:22,012
Welcome to the House of Our Lord.

950
01:37:23,579 --> 01:37:24,694
May Jesus be with you.

951
01:37:24,939 --> 01:37:27,055
May Jesus be with you.

952
01:39:33,819 --> 01:39:35,172
Jerry!

953
01:39:36,059 --> 01:39:37,538
Jerry!

954
01:39:39,339 --> 01:39:41,011
Yes, hon. What is it?

955
01:39:41,379 --> 01:39:44,337
l can't sleep.
Could you read me a story?

956
01:39:46,819 --> 01:39:48,138
Another story?

957
01:39:49,019 --> 01:39:50,213
Please?

958
01:39:50,739 --> 01:39:52,411
Well, all right.

959
01:39:54,179 --> 01:39:57,216
But just a short one. Scoot over.

960
01:39:57,659 --> 01:39:59,809
Let's see what we got here.

961
01:40:01,339 --> 01:40:02,374
We've got. . .

962
01:40:02,699 --> 01:40:04,769
. . . ''The Elves and the Shoemaker. ''

963
01:40:05,019 --> 01:40:07,658
-We've got--
-l met The Wizard today.

964
01:40:11,139 --> 01:40:12,049
What?

965
01:40:12,299 --> 01:40:15,689
l had to promise not to tell
my parents. So you can't. . .

966
01:40:15,939 --> 01:40:20,137
. . .tell Mommy or he'll be very angry
at me and never come back again.

967
01:40:20,579 --> 01:40:22,331
Well, Chrissy, l. . .

968
01:40:22,699 --> 01:40:24,451
. . .l don't believe you.

969
01:40:24,779 --> 01:40:26,531
Wizards don't exist.

970
01:40:26,979 --> 01:40:30,016
No, Jerry, you're wrong.
And l can prove it.

971
01:40:30,819 --> 01:40:31,808
You can, huh?

972
01:40:39,859 --> 01:40:41,815
He gave me these.

973
01:40:42,299 --> 01:40:43,618
They're yummy.

974
01:40:46,379 --> 01:40:48,574
But you can't have them, Jerry.

975
01:40:49,259 --> 01:40:51,614
He said he'd give me more tomorrow.

976
01:40:52,619 --> 01:40:54,018
Tomorrow?

977
01:40:55,619 --> 01:40:56,608
Where?

978
01:40:57,819 --> 01:41:00,572
At the picnic grounds.
Aren't they cute?

979
01:41:01,339 --> 01:41:04,615
My itty-bitty, baby porcupines.

980
01:41:05,259 --> 01:41:08,854
The Wizard said they come
from a land far, far away.

981
01:41:09,619 --> 01:41:13,532
Jerry, can l go see
The Wizard tomorrow?

982
01:41:14,859 --> 01:41:18,408
Well, he seems like such
a nice wizard.

983
01:41:18,659 --> 01:41:20,889
l don't see why not.

984
01:41:22,899 --> 01:41:25,208
But let's keep this our secret.

985
01:41:26,619 --> 01:41:27,608
Thank you, Jerry.

986
01:43:06,459 --> 01:43:07,687
Strom, how is your position?

987
01:43:07,939 --> 01:43:10,055
l'm in position across the river.

988
01:43:11,179 --> 01:43:14,808
We have a clear view of the girl
at the picnic ground.

989
01:43:18,179 --> 01:43:19,897
You're out of position.

990
01:43:20,419 --> 01:43:22,330
-What?
-You should be over closer.

991
01:43:22,579 --> 01:43:26,254
Jerry, we got a whole SWAT team out
here doing you a big favor.

992
01:43:26,499 --> 01:43:28,057
Just stay where you are.

993
01:43:31,299 --> 01:43:33,688
Snipers, recheck your fields of fire.

994
01:44:01,179 --> 01:44:02,817
-Jerry?
-He's coming.

995
01:44:05,219 --> 01:44:06,174
What's the matter?

996
01:44:06,779 --> 01:44:08,292
l'm fine, Stan.

997
01:44:10,219 --> 01:44:11,572
Want some tea?

998
01:44:13,059 --> 01:44:15,573
You're very thirsty today, aren't you?

999
01:44:21,139 --> 01:44:22,618
Oliver!

1000
01:44:25,819 --> 01:44:27,298
Oliver!

1001
01:44:31,619 --> 01:44:33,814
Where did you hide them chocolates?

1002
01:44:39,939 --> 01:44:42,373
Oh, there's some porcupines.

1003
01:44:43,219 --> 01:44:45,858
l'm just gonna go down
to the water for a minute.

1004
01:44:59,219 --> 01:45:00,857
ls this guy really coming?

1005
01:46:18,299 --> 01:46:20,096
Jerry's coming towards you now.

1006
01:46:20,339 --> 01:46:24,537
-l got him. What the hell's he doing?
-Jesus Christ, l have no idea.

1007
01:46:24,779 --> 01:46:26,132
This may have been a mistake.

1008
01:46:26,379 --> 01:46:28,017
Hold him, l'll be right there.

1009
01:46:29,259 --> 01:46:31,727
He had big, big eggs and. . . .

1010
01:46:31,979 --> 01:46:35,654
So he went up to the eggs,
and it started shaking.

1011
01:46:51,699 --> 01:46:52,654
l don't know.

1012
01:46:52,899 --> 01:46:54,378
What's going on?

1013
01:46:56,899 --> 01:47:00,130
-Jerry?
-Okay, guys. Hold your positions.

1014
01:47:06,739 --> 01:47:07,888
We're out of position.

1015
01:47:08,339 --> 01:47:13,208
Jerry, l got eight guys out here,
hung up, doing you a big favor.

1016
01:47:13,459 --> 01:47:16,371
You don't know what you're fucking
dealing with here.

1017
01:47:16,619 --> 01:47:19,929
You understand? You don't know
what you're dealing with here.

1018
01:47:20,179 --> 01:47:22,534
This guy is real, and l know it.

1019
01:47:23,059 --> 01:47:24,697
There's no Wizard, Jerry.

1020
01:47:25,419 --> 01:47:28,331
We got our man a year and a half ago.
Toby Wadenah.

1021
01:47:28,739 --> 01:47:31,207
You're making this real
difficult for me.

1022
01:47:32,779 --> 01:47:33,814
What, Stan?

1023
01:47:38,659 --> 01:47:40,138
We're calling it quits.

1024
01:47:40,659 --> 01:47:41,853
We're out of here.

1025
01:47:44,299 --> 01:47:46,574
lt's over. That's it.

1026
01:47:47,299 --> 01:47:48,732
Okay, Stan.

1027
01:47:50,779 --> 01:47:52,656
You do what you gotta do.

1028
01:47:52,899 --> 01:47:54,855
l'll do what l gotta do.

1029
01:47:57,299 --> 01:48:01,577
Just when you leave,
don't compromise this operation.

1030
01:48:03,459 --> 01:48:04,892
You understand me?

1031
01:48:12,179 --> 01:48:13,134
Come on.

1032
01:48:14,019 --> 01:48:16,692
He's staying, so do your best
not to engage the girl.

1033
01:48:17,019 --> 01:48:19,579
Okay, guys. We are pulling out.

1034
01:48:21,459 --> 01:48:23,450
l want you to know
l have to tell the mother.

1035
01:49:10,459 --> 01:49:12,370
You should've known Jerry 20
years ago.

1036
01:49:12,619 --> 01:49:13,495
He was a good cop.

1037
01:49:13,739 --> 01:49:15,331
He was a great cop.

1038
01:49:19,019 --> 01:49:20,418
Just, it's. . . .

1039
01:49:21,819 --> 01:49:22,968
lt's just sad.

1040
01:49:25,739 --> 01:49:27,695
He's become a drunk and a clown.

1041
01:49:36,819 --> 01:49:38,218
Fucking clown.

1042
01:50:02,939 --> 01:50:04,133
Chrissy!

1043
01:50:08,339 --> 01:50:10,011
Oh, my God, baby!

1044
01:50:10,699 --> 01:50:11,768
Oh, my God!

1045
01:50:12,499 --> 01:50:15,332
-Mommy, no.
-No, let's go. No!

1046
01:50:15,579 --> 01:50:16,807
No, Mommy.

1047
01:50:17,739 --> 01:50:19,331
Chrissy, stop it! Let's go.

1048
01:50:19,579 --> 01:50:20,534
Jerry!

1049
01:50:23,499 --> 01:50:25,012
-Get in the car.
-l want my doll--

1050
01:50:25,259 --> 01:50:26,453
Damn it, go!

1051
01:50:29,779 --> 01:50:31,258
Get in the car, now.

1052
01:50:31,499 --> 01:50:32,568
l want my bike!

1053
01:50:32,899 --> 01:50:33,854
Get in the car!

1054
01:50:41,019 --> 01:50:42,850
You fucking bastard, Jerry.

1055
01:50:47,739 --> 01:50:50,378
How could you do it to Chrissy?

1056
01:50:52,179 --> 01:50:54,010
Why would you do it to her?

1057
01:50:55,579 --> 01:50:57,695
She's 8 years old, Jerry!

1058
01:50:58,339 --> 01:51:00,614
She's only 8 years old!

1059
01:51:02,579 --> 01:51:04,297
She could have been killed!

1060
01:51:05,899 --> 01:51:06,888
Fucking. . .

1061
01:51:07,939 --> 01:51:09,372
. . .bastard!

1062
01:51:09,659 --> 01:51:11,297
Fucking crazy.

1063
01:51:14,179 --> 01:51:16,010
Why were you pretending. . .

1064
01:51:17,699 --> 01:51:21,658
. . .that you loved her and we were
starting this life together?

1065
01:51:26,059 --> 01:51:27,697
Fucking bastard.

1066
01:51:36,859 --> 01:51:38,611
You're fucking crazy.

1067
01:52:08,899 --> 01:52:11,971
Oh, boy. This was a bad one.

1068
01:52:23,339 --> 01:52:24,852
Jesus!

1069
01:52:25,699 --> 01:52:26,927
Poor bastard.

1070
01:52:57,499 --> 01:52:59,012
He's coming.

1071
01:52:59,459 --> 01:53:00,812
He's coming.

1072
01:53:03,579 --> 01:53:05,171
He's coming.

1073
01:53:05,939 --> 01:53:07,292
He's coming.

1074
01:53:08,059 --> 01:53:09,856
I know it.

1075
01:53:10,699 --> 01:53:12,610
I know it.

1076
01:54:38,859 --> 01:54:40,417
She said it.

1077
01:54:40,979 --> 01:54:42,492
She said it.

1078
01:54:43,179 --> 01:54:44,692
She did.
