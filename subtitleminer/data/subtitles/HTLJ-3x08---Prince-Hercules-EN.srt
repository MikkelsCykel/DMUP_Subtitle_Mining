This is the story
of a time long ago,

a time of myth and legend,

68
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:54,927
when the ancient gods
were petty and cruel,

69
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:57,563
and they plagued mankind
with suffering.

Hercules possessed a strength
the world had never seen,

a strength surpassed
only by the power of his heart.

battling the minions
of his wicked stepmother, Hera,

If we can convince Hercules
that he is Prince Milius,

get him to pledge his loyalty
to Hera on Equinox Day,

he'll be hers,

of the soldiers.

to see their prince anyway?

Milius.

158
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:31,464
Oh! I thought
you'd never return.

159
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:37,136
I'm-- I'm sorry, I--

160
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,171
Is something wrong?

161
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:42,908
He can't remember
anything, Kirin. Something
to do with the war.

162
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:46,012
He'll need your help.

163
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:49,715
Yes. We have a lot
of catching up to do then.

Your sons
can't wait to see you.

Boys, go give
your father a hug.

They... seem
a little uncomfortable.

They don't remember you.

169
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:10,369
Macareus was only two
when you left,
and I was carrying Protos.

170
00:11:12,304 --> 00:11:14,974
Why don't you two guys
show me your toys.

171
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:17,009
Okay.
Okay.

172
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,349

[ Man ]
I've got it. Thanks.

176
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:41,634
[ Woman ]
I wanna see the archers.

177
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:43,969
[ Man ]
How about a small wager?

178
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:46,338
[ Man #2 ]
Ten dinars for the archer
on the left.

Good to see you!

Where's Hercules?
Oh, you know,
off being heroic.

that legends are made of.
He'll be along soon.

183
00:11:57,416 --> 00:12:00,086
I hope so.
The festival wouldn't be
the same without him.

Looking for Electra?
No.

She here?
Yeah, and she's
looking for you.

186
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:07,760
Really?
She wants you
to meet her cousin.

187
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:13,132
Whoa! Ah--
Two against one?

188
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:15,034
Okay. Oh!

189
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:17,703
I give up! I give up!
Hey! Hey! Watch it!

Oh.

00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:28,180
Now kiss your father
good night and go wash up.

Good night, Father.
Good night.

Good night, Father.
Good night, boys.

Sweet dreams.

Good night, Mom.
I'll be in in a minute.

Okay.

199
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:42,895
Along with everything else,
I'd forgotten how much
I miss my family.

00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:46,899
You're very good with them.

201

They're good kids.
Well, they should be.

202
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:53,239
They're your sons.
Yeah.

203

[ Chuckles ]

204
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:57,243
Is anything coming back?

205
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:02,281
You know, I--
I won't lie to you.

206
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,950
You know, I have--
I have this sense,
you know?

207
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,952
This feels...

208
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:10,623
good and warm and natural,

209
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:13,959
but every time
I think back,

210
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,961
all I can see
are blank faces.

211

There's no rush.
It'll all come back.

We have plenty of time.
Yeah.

Your move.
Thank you, my queen.

It's working, Lonius.
I can feel it.

215

When the sun strikes
the Hera stone
on Equinox Day...

216

and Hercules
pledges his loyalty,

217
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:10,115
he'll do
whatever we want.

218
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:15,120
With a leader like Hercules,
Gorgos would be ours
for the taking.

219
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:19,124
Forget Gorgos! We'd rule
the peninsula within a year.

may I have a word?

In private.

00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,879
What is it?
You look troubled.

224
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,715
I can't go through with this.

225
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:45,517
Why? Does Hercules
suspect something?

226
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:48,921
No, nothing.

227
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:51,924
It's just that he's...

228
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:53,926
nice, decent.

229
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:56,061
It's not fair.

230
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:58,397
And was it fair that Milius
was taken from us...

231
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,734
on the eve of
Kastus's greatest victory?

232
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:05,170
No, but I sense
in Hercules a--

233
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:08,274
a longing
for his own family.

234
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:10,609
To make him live this lie--

235
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:13,279
I'd worry about
your own children.

236

What are you saying?
You wouldn't--

237
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:19,351
It's a big castle, Kirin.

00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:22,354
Accidents can happen.

239
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:31,363
Lonius, I appreciate your
arranging this tour for me,

240
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:33,365
but do we really need
all these bodyguards?

00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:35,701
Uh, one can never be
too cautious, my lord.

242
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:38,370
You have many enemies
in the neighboring
kingdom of Gorgos.

00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,372
Why is that?

It's very complicated.
Welcome home,

I saw him in Corinth once--
Shut up!

Ah! Five years
is a long time, my lord.

[ Grunting ]

465
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:36,794
[ Man ]
Get him out of there!

466
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:39,097
[ Clamoring ]

467
00:31:43,434 --> 00:31:45,370
Go on. Get back.

468
00:31:49,173 --> 00:31:51,509
Get him out of there.

469
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:03,121
[ Man ]
It's amazing.
You--

470
00:32:03,121 --> 00:32:06,124
You always were
uncommonly strong, my lord.

471
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,462
I was?

472
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,302
Just one more night, my dear.

473
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:20,438
That's all.
What about the purple man
who says he knows him?

474
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:22,840
He won't live
to see the morning.

475
00:32:24,842 --> 00:32:27,845
My dear Kirin,

476
00:32:27,845 --> 00:32:30,915
after the sun strikes
the Hera stone tomorrow,

477
00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:35,019
you'll be joined to one
of the world's living legends.

478
00:32:36,354 --> 00:32:39,357
And one day,
after I'm gone,

479
00:32:39,357 --> 00:32:43,027
you'll rule
as king and queen,

480
00:32:43,027 --> 00:32:48,366
a throne that eventually
will go to one of your sons.

481
00:32:48,366 --> 00:32:52,370
If you can't do this
for me or yourself,

482
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:55,373
do it for them.

483
00:32:55,373 --> 00:32:58,042
The same sons
you threatened to kill?

484
00:32:58,376 --> 00:33:03,715
These have been stressful times
and sometimes I say things
I come to regret, but--

485
00:33:04,048 --> 00:33:09,854
you must know
I would never ever
harm my grandchildren.

486
00:33:11,522 --> 00:33:13,524
Now, go.

487
00:33:13,524 --> 00:33:15,626
Do what you must.

488
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:23,935
You've done wonders
for the children.

489
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:25,937
They've really missed
having a father.

490
00:33:28,272 --> 00:33:31,275
I feel like there's
been a lot missing
out of my life too.

491
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:40,952
These are for you.

492
00:33:42,286 --> 00:33:45,289
Oh, that's very sweet.

493
00:33:45,289 --> 00:33:48,292
You say it as if
I've never done anything
like this before.

494
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,696
No, it's just that he--
I-I mean, you--

495
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:57,702
Y-You were never s-so--
so kind and gentle
before the war.

496
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:00,171
The war must have
changed you.

497
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:11,315
How could I have ever
treated you differently?

498
00:34:26,998 --> 00:34:29,667
I think I'm falling
in love with you...

499
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:31,669
all over again.

500
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:37,408
I still can't
recall our past.

501
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:41,079
But the way
I feel about you--

502
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,414
I don't think
 I can wait until I do.

503
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:50,088
Then don't. Don't wait.

504
00:35:25,323 --> 00:35:27,558
I could get in
a lot of trouble
for this, my lady.

505
00:35:27,892 --> 00:35:29,560
Don't be insolent.

506

[ Gasps ]
Who are you?

507
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:44,542
I'm Princess Kirin.
Milius's wife.
Why are you purple?

508
00:35:44,542 --> 00:35:47,011
I like it.
What do you want?

509
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:49,380
I wanna know
about your friend.

510
00:35:49,714 --> 00:35:51,382
Hercules? Why?

511
00:35:51,716 --> 00:35:55,786
Because I'm in love
with him, and I think
he's in love with me.

512
00:35:57,121 --> 00:35:59,457
Oh, great.

513

[ Kirin Screams ]
Guard! Please come!

514
00:36:06,797 --> 00:36:10,134
Put down your sword
and open the door. Huh?

515
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,975
Okay, back.
Back, back, back, back.

516
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:20,711
Now, don't make a sound,
or I'll kill her.

517
00:36:21,078 --> 00:36:24,482
What is going on here?

518
00:36:24,482 --> 00:36:27,552
You behave
or your princess dies.

- Who cares?
- You pig!

Come on!

522
00:36:44,435 --> 00:36:48,439
He's gone. They must
already be preparing him
for the vows of allegiance.

523
00:36:49,774 --> 00:36:52,109
Will Hera's priests
be attending the ceremony?

524
00:36:52,109 --> 00:36:55,580
Of course.
Okay. Here's what
we're gonna do.

525
00:37:05,189 --> 00:37:07,525
I'm proud of you, my son.

526
00:37:10,194 --> 00:37:11,862
You've memorized
your pledge?

527
00:37:11,862 --> 00:37:14,732
Yes, Mother.

528
00:37:19,537 --> 00:37:23,341
My queen,
the purple man has escaped.

529
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:25,343
Let's not take any chances.

530
00:37:25,676 --> 00:37:28,679
Close off the ceremony
to all outsiders.
Mm-hmm.

531
00:37:30,448 --> 00:37:33,217
Let the ceremony begin.

532
00:37:37,622 --> 00:37:39,290
We gather once more...

533
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:43,995
to pledge our loyalty
 to Hera, our patron goddess,

534
00:37:44,328 --> 00:37:49,734
and to thank her
for delivering
our Prince Milius back to us.

535
00:37:49,734 --> 00:37:54,138
Today, my son
will show his gratitude...

536
00:37:54,138 --> 00:37:57,475
by vowing his
allegiance to Hera,

537
00:37:57,842 --> 00:38:01,245
asking for her guidance
as he leads us in battle,

538
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:05,249
that we may
vanquish our enemies.

of the autumnal equinox,

Remember Deianeira.
Deianeira?

That still works!

This is for the tavern.

558
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:10,207
And this is for the field.

559
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:14,211
And this is just
on principle, friend.

560

Yes, I am, Iolaus.

Wait for us!

Now, you two,
you listen to your mother.

end differently.
