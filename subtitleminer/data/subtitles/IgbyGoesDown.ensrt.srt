00:01:10,069 --> 00:01:12,322
Why couldn't she have been
a fucking smoker?

2
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:16,242
This has nothing to do with
her being in such wonderful shape.

3
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:19,787
The cause of our trouble
was our inability to come up with a drug...

4
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:23,666
...short of paint thinner, that would be
at least somewhat novel to her system.

5
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:26,419
She's built up a tolerance to everything.

6
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:29,631
A tolerance?
She's taking her fucking afternoon nap.

7
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:30,965
Shut up, lgby!

8
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:32,759
We're fine.

9
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:50,526
It's all the fucking tennis.

10
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:04,082
It's almost 6:00.

11
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:17,720
Igby.

12
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,786
<i>They'll do it. I don't know what it is,
but I know they'll do it.</i>

13
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:27,665
<i>-Let's all drink to Bay State...
-Let's drink to Julia. Have you met her yet?</i>

14
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:29,709
<i>If she's anything like her sister...</i>

15
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:35,006
<i>We'll drink to Johnny and Julia and Bay
State Power and love and happiness and...</i>

16
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,342
<i>Here you are.</i>

17
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:39,886
<i>For the love of Pete,
it's the Witch and Dopey.</i>

18
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:44,140
<i>I've never been up here before.
It's awfully quaint, isn't it?</i>

19
00:03:44,223 --> 00:03:45,308
<i>We like it.</i>

20
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:48,227
Dad, when are you going back to work?

21
00:03:49,937 --> 00:03:51,064
Soon.

22
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,483
-You're not really sick anymore.
-No.

23
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:56,152
Not really sick.

24
00:03:56,235 --> 00:04:00,156
But not completely well.
Not yet, I don't think.

25
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:03,910
-When will you be better?
-ln the spring.

26
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:07,080
-The spring?
-I'm no good in the winter.

27
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:09,207
These gray days...

28
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,584
...they're so sad.

29
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:14,212
What about next winter?

30
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:42,991
Jason, tell me, dearest,
are you planning on bathing this week?

31
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:44,784
I beg your pardon?

32
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:46,953
It seems to have slipped
your mind last week.

33
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:49,497
-But I'm not dirty.
-No...

34
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:54,711
...dirty, I mean, you've done nothing that'd
make you dirty for quite some time now.

35
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,798
But you do reek, darling,
of tobacco, from your...

36
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,135
...yellow toenails to your yellow fingernails
to your yellow teeth...

37
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:03,970
...to your yellow hair.

38
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:07,056
Sorry to have offended.

39
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:08,516
Me?

40
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:11,978
A piece of gristle.

41
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:18,276
Not on an empty stomach, dear.

42
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,327
Excuse me.

43
00:05:56,397 --> 00:06:00,485
<i>Boys, your mother was quite right
to have chastised me.</i>

44
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,572
Good personal hygiene...

45
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:09,327
...is one of the most essential disciplines
a man can have...

46
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,537
...in this world.

47
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:14,040
Chin-chin!

48
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,598
<i>Don't indulge him anymore.</i>

49
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:33,226
<i>How can anyone be afraid of a clown?</i>

50
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:34,811
<i>Just leave him.</i>

51
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:38,898
<i>C'mon, old man.
This is no way to be on your birthday.</i>

52
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:42,527
Everybody's gone home.

53
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:49,492
There's nobody left downstairs.
It's just you and me, now.

54
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:53,830
Hey.

55
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:58,459
It's just you and me, old man.

56
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:26,237
<i>If Heaven is such a wonderful place...</i>

57
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:30,742
...then how was getting crucified
such a big fucking sacrifice?

58
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:40,752
Mrs. Slocumb,
it's wonderful to see you again.

59
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,211
I hope you drove.

60
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:45,590
No more beautiful place on God's earth...

61
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:47,884
...than Connecticut at Christmas time.

62
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:51,095
-Oliver drove me down from the city.
-Please.

63
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:54,891
Congratulations on Oliver.

64
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:57,560
I hear he's already established himself...

65
00:07:57,644 --> 00:08:00,647
...as the cream of
the Columbia freshman crop.

66
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:04,817
We do take a lot of pride
in seeing our boys succeed.

67
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:07,612
But of course, we're here to discuss...

68
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:09,155
...lgby.

69
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:16,496
Honor roll? You flunked everything.
Not even a 'D' in art this time.

70
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:19,332
-Did you enjoy making me look like a fool?
-I dunno.

71
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:20,625
You don't know?

72
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,795
Poor Mrs. Slocumb doesn't have a clue
what old lgby is up to.

73
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:26,798
-Dithering, foolish lady. Did you enjoy that?
-I dunno.

74
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:29,008
-I beg your pardon?
-No!

75
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,470
Then what are you? A pathological liar?

76
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:34,138
I don't know.

77
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:36,724
You don't know? Liar! You little liar!

78
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:41,145
How dare you! And where were you when
your brother was flunking out of school?

79
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:42,689
I was in college.

80
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,941
Igby is not my fault.

81
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,445
Did you even, for a second...

82
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,572
...think about how this reflects upon me?

83
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,199
No.

84
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:59,664
I am not going to go through this again.
You had a chance. You flunked everything.

85
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:01,916
That's almost impressive. It really is.

86
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,377
You know what's going to
happen to you now, mister?

87
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:08,673
Do you know where your sterling
performance is going to take you now...

88
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,467
...little man?

89
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:15,430
Choate?

90
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:20,059
-Cadet report!
-Oh, shit!

91
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:22,437
Second watch is early.

92
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:25,481
Lights out!

93
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:29,152
In your bunks!

94
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,571
You heard him. Let's go!

95
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,908
All right, Mr. Patterson, lights out!

96
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:39,621
What part of "lights out"
don't you understand?

97
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:44,167
-Turtle! The spray!
-ln your bunk, Mistletoe!

98
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:53,134
All right, Fredrick, you know the rules.

99
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:57,096
Turtle!

100
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:02,393
Both of you, lights out! In your bunks!

101
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:33,341
<i>This is your godfather, lgby.
Are you listening to me?</i>

102
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:37,553
<i>This is the best thing that could have
happened to you, military school.</i>

103
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:41,516
<i>To get out of that comfortable world
you were raised in. Strike out on your own.</i>

104
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:45,520
<i>You know those East Coast country club
schools do you no good in the real world.</i>

105
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:48,523
<i>It might be tough now,
but it's gonna make you tough.</i>

106
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:51,859
<i>Unlike the rest
of your coddled contemporaries.</i>

107
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:53,319
Fire!

108
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:06,958
And lgby goes down.

109
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:09,919
<i>I bet you've made some real buddies.</i>

110
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:11,838
<i>Haven't you?</i>

111
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:15,008
Igby has buddies.

112
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,176
-Haven't you got buddies?
-Many.

113
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,013
You have that buddy
with the cute little name.

114
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:23,766
-That little buddy, Tortoise.
-Turtle.

115
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,227
Turtle?

116
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:27,520
Turtle.

117
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:28,855
He was my best buddy.

118
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,649
Then his rifle backfired
and blew his face off.

119
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:34,777
We all learned a lesson
about weapon maintenance that day.

120
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:36,446
Why didn't the school inform me?

121
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,114
It wasn't the school's fault.

122
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:39,866
They were great about it.

123
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:42,035
Paid for the dry-cleaning and everything.

124
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,620
Not because they had to...

125
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,873
...but because it was the right thing to do.

126
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:52,462
I believe that certain people in life
are meant to fall by the wayside...

127
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:56,341
...to serve as warnings for the rest of us.
Signposts along the way.

128
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:57,425
To where?

129
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:01,095
Success.

130
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:06,726
Our father would be a "slippery when
schizophrenic" sign, for instance.

131
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:10,855
Along the highway of life.

132
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:15,026
This summer...

133
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:17,654
...I want you to come and work for me.

134
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:22,158
Work with my crew.
Renovate some of my New York properties.

135
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:26,079
You up to bein' exploited
by your old pal this summer?

136
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:33,586
-What do you say?
-Stay at your Hamptons summer house?

137
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:36,464
-On the weekends.
-I'm your man, sir.

138
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:37,966
Good!

139
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:43,304
-When are you headed back to the academy?
-0700 tomorrow morning, sir.

140
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:13,960
Sorry.

141
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:30,351
<i>"This letter is to inform you,
the recipient, that my son...</i>

142
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:32,854
"...the bearer of this letter...

143
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:36,983
-"...has permission to use my credit card..."
-You can take your break now, Kevin.

144
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:38,109
Thank you.

145
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,903
-May I help you, son?
-I need a room.

146
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,780
And you have a reservation?

147
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:45,992
-I assume my mother made one.
-Under her name?

148
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:51,080
-This is your mother?
-Yep.

149
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:57,462
No reservation under that name.

150
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:58,963
That is so typical.

151
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:02,175
-ln town looking at schools, are you?
-Colleges.

152
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:06,471
She had to fly home. I have a brother,
a teenager. Bit of a problem.

153
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,514
Every family has one.

154
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,684
What colleges are you lookin' at, son?

155
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:13,394
All of 'em, really.

156
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:17,357
Just so long as it's here.
Here in the Midwest.

157
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,567
I hear ya.

158
00:14:22,946 --> 00:14:25,531
Hello, is Georgie there? He isn't?

159
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:29,869
This is Mr. Slocumb,
Georgie's favorite teacher from the academy.

160
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:31,955
Who are you?

161
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:35,166
Really? I didn't know Georgie had a sister.

162
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,710
I'm in town for a little while...

163
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:40,171
...at the O'Hare Hilton.

164
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,676
Listen, what are you up to?

165
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:50,556
But I'm an incredibly cool
and young teacher.

166
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:54,268
Why? How old are you?

167
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:57,563
Really?

168
00:14:58,314 --> 00:14:59,899
You sound older than 11.

169
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,653
You're right. It's probably the cigarettes.

170
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:07,282
Hello?

171
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:08,700
<i>Mimi Slocumb, please.</i>

172
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:10,076
This is she.

173
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:11,911
<i>I'm calling from the O'Hare Hilton.</i>

174
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:32,849
Hi.

175
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,519
You can stand at attention there, Slocumb.

176
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:47,447
What exactly
do you think you're doing here?

177
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,284
The Ritz-Carlton was full.

178
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:57,123
You know I'm very tense these days,
very anxious about all of lgby's trouble.

179
00:15:57,165 --> 00:16:01,878
My son in drug camp, for God's sake,
and then you make me so very cross.

180
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:06,132
And I take the trouble to tell you
specifically what I require...

181
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:08,134
-...a half a grapefruit and...
-Mimi.

182
00:16:08,176 --> 00:16:09,469
Let's...

183
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:12,013
Let's get off the maid.

184
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,264
Help!

185
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:17,310
<i>Super Cadet
has got this big smile on his face.</i>

186
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:19,228
<i>No one takes him seriously.</i>

187
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:22,357
No one knows
that he's been expelled that morning.

188
00:16:23,358 --> 00:16:24,651
They scream...

189
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,403
..." jump," and surprise...

190
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:29,822
...he does a swan dive onto the pavement.

191
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:34,410
You can still see the stain in the pavement
where his head popped open.

192
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:39,832
Every morning, I used that blotch to know
where to line up for breakfast formation.

193
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,752
Do you contemplate suicide?

194
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:44,212
Constantly.

195
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,965
You totally missed the point of my story.

196
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:48,841
-Have I?
-Completely.

197
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:52,512
It's about the hypocrisy of the place,
which I couldn't tolerate.

198
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:55,556
You let me do my job, and you do yours.

199
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:57,183
I'm trying to fucking help you.

200
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,102
-You think I need help?
-Apparently.

201
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:02,563
You think that I don't know
how to do my job?

202
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:06,651
No offense, but how good could you be,
working at this place?

203
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:10,446
You know, I can only be as effective
as you allow me to be.

204
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,448
Just tried to help you with my story.

205
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:15,159
How did you feel about what the boy did?

206
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:20,164
I feel like he should've really reconsidered
his fucking options, don't you?

207
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:22,792
-What are your options?
-I don't know yet.

208
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:25,378
Who were you trying to hurt with the pills?

209
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:29,924
Nobody. I was improvising as I went.
I actually didn't give it a lot of thought.

210
00:17:30,008 --> 00:17:33,720
I think that you are much more aware
than even you realize.

211
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:37,348
Yeah? Well, you're an idiot, so...

212
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:39,934
What the fuck are you doing?

213
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:41,686
I don't like being called an idiot.

214
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:44,105
You prick! You can't fucking hit me!

215
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:50,570
Next fall, you'll be starting
at yet another school.

216
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:53,323
Are you gonna try to make an effort
this time around?

217
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:00,663
I'm considering my options.

218
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:07,003
Am I to understand you have four separate
doctors, all writing you prescriptions?

219
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:08,254
It's a point of convenience.

220
00:18:08,338 --> 00:18:10,923
With no knowledge
of what the others are prescribing!

221
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:13,134
My dear man, I assure you,
I need my peppies.

222
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:16,346
Perhaps if you cut down on the Valium
and the sleeping pills...

223
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:19,432
-...you'd have more energy.
-Without them I get very tense.

224
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:22,852
You get tense
because you pop speed like candy.

225
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:27,148
-Bad Mrs. Slocumb.
-I beg your pardon.

226
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:31,277
Patients actually tolerate
this cheeky-little-shit routine of yours?

227
00:18:31,361 --> 00:18:33,112
Find it cute, do they?

228
00:18:33,488 --> 00:18:35,490
-Mrs. Slocumb...
-Out!

229
00:18:44,082 --> 00:18:46,501
-I'm not well.
-You mean literally?

230
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,753
Yes, literally. They've run tests.

231
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:51,965
This doesn't seem so bad.

232
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:55,593
As nice a place as any to spend the spring.
Round out your rough edges.

233
00:18:55,677 --> 00:18:56,970
This'll do for ya.

234
00:18:57,011 --> 00:19:00,682
I still want you
to come and work for me this summer.

235
00:19:00,932 --> 00:19:03,977
Stay with Bunny and me
at the summer house. What do you think?

236
00:19:04,185 --> 00:19:07,397
Now, listen, the reason that Mimi...

237
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:10,441
...your mother, hasn't been able to...

238
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:13,903
...visit you... I'm sure she wanted to.
She went to the...

239
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:18,157
...hospital for a bit of a rest,
and they discovered something else.

240
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:20,910
Something rather bad.

241
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:25,164
She's getting treatment for it. Everybody's
damn confident she'll be fine, but...

242
00:19:25,707 --> 00:19:27,750
You know what mastectomy is?

243
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:32,213
Your house...

244
00:19:32,547 --> 00:19:34,048
It's on the beach, right?

245
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:36,884
<i>Contract.</i>

246
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:41,097
<i>It's a contract. See,
families should be run like companies...</i>

247
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,642
<i>...with everybody's responsibilities
clearly defined.</i>

248
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:46,769
<i>Children, at the age of reason...</i>

249
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:50,690
<i>...should be provided with legal
representation and a contract drawn up.</i>

250
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:53,860
All the best relationships
are based on contracts.

251
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:56,154
Bunny and I have a contract.

252
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:58,489
Now that you're gonna come
and work for me...

253
00:19:58,573 --> 00:20:00,199
...we're gonna have one.

254
00:20:00,575 --> 00:20:04,287
And that piece of paper is your clean slate.

255
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:13,755
You know, you could just
take a later shuttle back to DC.

256
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:16,049
I'm past the worst of it, I think.

257
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:21,304
I'm meeting that dean
from St. Anthony's, McKaye...

258
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:25,350
...in the morning,
to beg him to admit your brother this fall.

259
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:27,602
A mother's work is never done.

260
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:30,313
-D.H. is collecting lgby today?
-Yeah.

261
00:20:30,772 --> 00:20:33,149
He's picking him up from "the camp."

262
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:36,903
What a great investment
that has proven to be.

263
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:42,241
Getting to hear, for two months,
on a weekly basis...

264
00:20:42,283 --> 00:20:44,327
...just how much my son hates me.

265
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:47,372
That's always been
one of his favorite topics of conversation.

266
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:51,584
His creation was an act of animosity.
Why shouldn't his life be one?

267
00:20:57,924 --> 00:21:02,595
Listen, Ollie, this summer, lgby's going to
bunk with you at Columbia during the week.

268
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:04,931
You both can go to the Hamptons
on the weekends.

269
00:21:04,973 --> 00:21:06,516
Of course.

270
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,435
I'll baby-sit lgby all summer long.

271
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:12,730
You know, you have been
a very bad older brother.

272
00:21:15,984 --> 00:21:17,860
And yet you're the one he hates.

273
00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:23,366
<i>Basically, it's like reverse Darwinism.</i>

274
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:27,370
A situation in which
a less evolved species...

275
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:31,332
...is better equipped to survive
than a more evolved creature.

276
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:36,587
Which, if you think about it,
isn't really reverse Darwinism, so much as...

277
00:21:36,671 --> 00:21:38,923
...bigger-picture Darwinism, if you will.

278
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:41,217
What?

279
00:21:52,729 --> 00:21:54,272
-Tommy?
-Yeah.

280
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:57,400
What's happening?
Did you hear that? We were out there for...

281
00:21:57,483 --> 00:22:00,945
-What are you doing?
-Nothing.

282
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:03,823
Did you hear the locks? It needs oil...

283
00:22:03,906 --> 00:22:05,742
-...or something.
-I'll fix that.

284
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:10,204
Look at this guy. Look at this strapping
young working hunk of manhood.

285
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:12,415
That's my godson, lgby.

286
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:14,876
Ever hear that name, "lgby"?

287
00:22:15,418 --> 00:22:18,421
It's funny. You met his brother
at the office the other day.

288
00:22:20,214 --> 00:22:21,466
How you doin'?

289
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:22,717
Good.

290
00:22:27,764 --> 00:22:29,223
How you doin'?

291
00:22:29,724 --> 00:22:31,893
You're doin' "well."

292
00:22:37,649 --> 00:22:40,360
How's the work comin' along there, stud?

293
00:22:41,736 --> 00:22:43,821
-Well?
-Do we need this wall?

294
00:22:44,405 --> 00:22:46,616
Three thousand square feet over!

295
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:51,955
You got the new plumbing.
What do you call, risers, so we have very...

296
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:53,831
We've got 27 windows.

297
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:57,794
What are you doing, you little reptile?

298
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:00,254
Look at this.

299
00:23:16,688 --> 00:23:18,856
Hi, honey!

300
00:24:05,612 --> 00:24:07,280
It's not that cold out here.

301
00:24:07,989 --> 00:24:09,198
No.

302
00:24:10,366 --> 00:24:11,618
Who are you?

303
00:24:11,868 --> 00:24:12,994
Sookie.

304
00:24:13,077 --> 00:24:15,538
-Sookie?
-Sookie Sapperstein.

305
00:24:15,622 --> 00:24:16,748
Yeah?

306
00:24:17,415 --> 00:24:18,499
Yeah.

307
00:24:22,086 --> 00:24:24,213
Are you somebody's daughter?

308
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,007
I'm somebody's daughter.

309
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:27,967
I mean somebody here at this party.

310
00:24:28,843 --> 00:24:29,886
No.

311
00:24:30,303 --> 00:24:31,763
Then why are you here?

312
00:24:33,014 --> 00:24:34,724
I'm with the catering company.

313
00:24:35,183 --> 00:24:36,684
The woman hired us for the party.

314
00:24:36,726 --> 00:24:38,978
Why do you think I'm dressed
like a figure skater?

315
00:24:41,189 --> 00:24:42,815
Bunny hired you.

316
00:24:43,358 --> 00:24:44,817
She's my godmother.

317
00:24:47,028 --> 00:24:50,156
Actually, she's not.
Her husband, D.H. Banes...

318
00:24:50,531 --> 00:24:51,991
...he's my godfather.

319
00:24:52,533 --> 00:24:54,202
Are those cloves?

320
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:57,497
Outstanding! Can I bum one?

321
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:02,543
No.

322
00:25:06,923 --> 00:25:08,341
Got a light?

323
00:25:11,469 --> 00:25:12,845
And a cigarette?

324
00:25:21,688 --> 00:25:24,816
Rachel, I see you've met the boys.

325
00:25:25,066 --> 00:25:26,192
We've already met.

326
00:25:26,276 --> 00:25:29,195
Bunny, Rachel is the choreographer
I was telling you about...

327
00:25:29,237 --> 00:25:33,866
...who's renting that commercial space
from us down in SoHo, using it as a studio.

328
00:25:33,908 --> 00:25:35,910
-Remember?
-How wonderful.

329
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,579
Boys...

330
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:44,544
It's so wonderful you could come and stay.

331
00:25:45,211 --> 00:25:48,548
-lgby, I could just eat you with a spoon.
-Don't.

332
00:25:50,758 --> 00:25:53,845
-Now, when did you get out of camp?
-Two months ago.

333
00:25:53,928 --> 00:25:57,473
I've been working for D.H. all summer.
That's why I'm here every weekend.

334
00:25:57,557 --> 00:26:01,019
My wife is the philanthropist of the family.

335
00:26:01,102 --> 00:26:03,271
Especially fond of dance, aren't you dear?

336
00:26:03,354 --> 00:26:05,815
D.H., look. Pull around.

337
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:07,275
Here we go.

338
00:26:07,358 --> 00:26:12,113
-We have guests behind us.
-The guests. I see.

339
00:26:13,364 --> 00:26:16,534
Are you two in school or something?

340
00:26:16,868 --> 00:26:20,121
I'm at Columbia,
and as far as this year's challenge for lgby...

341
00:26:20,204 --> 00:26:23,916
...we're still waiting to hear back
from this fun parochial school in DC.

342
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,961
-"Perchance to dream."
-He's done the Protestant circuit.

343
00:26:27,045 --> 00:26:30,715
Mom must have some photos of the
head priest with an altar boy for them...

344
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:32,467
...to even be considering lgby.

345
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:37,847
-We're all at a bit of a loss as to...
-Whenever I'm at a loss, I dip into Rilke.

346
00:26:39,641 --> 00:26:42,602
Rilke? That tortures me.

347
00:26:42,936 --> 00:26:46,397
Every Christmas, some asshole
gives me this copy of "Young Poet"...

348
00:26:46,481 --> 00:26:50,735
...with this patronizing note on the flap
about how it's supposed to change my life.

349
00:26:50,818 --> 00:26:54,364
-Maybe you should read it before judging it.
-I'm pretty confident.

350
00:26:54,447 --> 00:26:56,658
After all, one of the copies was from you.

351
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:59,911
I'm Oliver, and this is my little brother, lgby.

352
00:26:59,994 --> 00:27:01,663
What kind of a name is "lgby"?

353
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:05,750
It's the kind of a name that someone
named Sookie is in no position to question.

354
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:06,918
Sookie?

355
00:27:07,168 --> 00:27:09,587
-Where do you go to school?
-Bennington.

356
00:27:09,671 --> 00:27:11,839
Ollie's majoring in Neo-Fascism
at Columbia.

357
00:27:11,923 --> 00:27:13,675
-Economics.
-Semantics.

358
00:27:13,841 --> 00:27:16,010
-What's your major?
-Attitude.

359
00:27:16,886 --> 00:27:19,764
-I've gotta get back to the bar.
-That's where I'm headed.

360
00:27:19,847 --> 00:27:21,808
Catch you kids later.

361
00:27:26,938 --> 00:27:28,398
D.H. brings you up a lot.

362
00:27:28,481 --> 00:27:30,441
-Captain Charisma is my godfather.
-I know.

363
00:27:30,525 --> 00:27:33,528
So, if something horrible, God forbid...

364
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:36,656
...were to befall my mother,
I would live with him and Bunny.

365
00:27:36,739 --> 00:27:40,118
-I know what godparents are.
-You're ripping apart my potential home.

366
00:27:40,201 --> 00:27:43,913
-My being here offends you?
-Your being here is great.

367
00:27:44,622 --> 00:27:47,583
-I had no choice.
-No, really. I think you're great.

368
00:27:47,667 --> 00:27:48,626
Thank you.

369
00:27:48,876 --> 00:27:51,379
It's him bringing you here that tortures me.

370
00:27:51,587 --> 00:27:55,591
I love the fact that the captain
of the morality team invites his chick...

371
00:27:55,675 --> 00:28:00,179
...to the same party as his wife, who isn't
the sharpest tool in the shed anymore.

372
00:28:00,263 --> 00:28:04,642
And what's more, none of their supposed
mutual friends protects her.

373
00:28:04,726 --> 00:28:09,230
None of them bats a fucking eyelash
at his hypocrisy. I love that, I really do.

374
00:28:09,314 --> 00:28:12,650
Embrace your moral hypocrisy,
D.H. Go for it.

375
00:28:16,904 --> 00:28:19,324
-But me you're okay with.
-Honestly.

376
00:28:19,657 --> 00:28:21,117
Listen, you know what?

377
00:28:21,409 --> 00:28:24,912
If you're ever in the city,
you should pop by the loft.

378
00:28:25,538 --> 00:28:27,332
We're done working on it.

379
00:28:29,542 --> 00:28:30,501
I know.

380
00:28:55,318 --> 00:28:58,780
<i>No worries, Mother.
Igby is on his way to the airport.</i>

381
00:28:58,988 --> 00:29:02,075
<i>The driver's been briefed
to take him directly to LaGuardia.</i>

382
00:29:02,158 --> 00:29:05,244
<i>He'll be in St. Anthony's loving custody
by this afternoon.</i>

383
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:08,790
<i>And happy birthday, Mother.</i>

384
00:29:09,499 --> 00:29:10,792
<i>Much love.</i>

385
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,335
Sir?

386
00:29:12,669 --> 00:29:15,755
It's my mother's birthday today, and I forgot.

387
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:18,841
Is there any way that...

388
00:29:19,092 --> 00:29:20,510
...we could just...

389
00:29:20,593 --> 00:29:23,346
...make a quick stop
in the city somewhere, so...

390
00:29:23,554 --> 00:29:25,223
...I can get her something?

391
00:29:25,848 --> 00:29:27,183
She'd be so surprised.

392
00:29:51,666 --> 00:29:53,126
Can I help you?

393
00:29:53,668 --> 00:29:54,752
Hey.

394
00:29:55,086 --> 00:29:58,631
You remember me?
From the Hamptons John Birch Cotillion.

395
00:30:00,174 --> 00:30:02,552
Yeah. How you doin'?

396
00:30:03,219 --> 00:30:04,637
Come on in.

397
00:30:05,138 --> 00:30:08,474
So, you said you'd come by and you did.
A month later.

398
00:30:08,516 --> 00:30:13,479
-Love what you've done with the space.
-I love what the space has done to her.

399
00:30:14,188 --> 00:30:16,608
-lgby.
-This is my friend, Russel.

400
00:30:16,691 --> 00:30:17,942
-Hi.
-Hi.

401
00:30:18,192 --> 00:30:20,945
-lgby is D.H.'s...
-Godson.

402
00:30:21,613 --> 00:30:23,823
-Russel's just...
-What?

403
00:30:26,326 --> 00:30:28,786
He's just a brilliant artist.

404
00:30:29,329 --> 00:30:31,831
So, what are you doing here?

405
00:30:31,914 --> 00:30:32,957
Celebrating.

406
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:35,335
St. Anthony's accepted me.

407
00:30:36,336 --> 00:30:37,920
Congratulations?

408
00:30:38,713 --> 00:30:40,381
I'm on the lam.

409
00:30:40,673 --> 00:30:43,343
-You want to stay here?
-lf there's enough room.

410
00:30:43,384 --> 00:30:45,345
You can't stay here.

411
00:30:45,887 --> 00:30:49,140
I don't even live here.
I rent this space to work in. I work here.

412
00:30:49,265 --> 00:30:51,768
I pay rent.
D.H. doesn't even know you're here?

413
00:30:51,851 --> 00:30:53,353
It's kind of awkward.

414
00:30:53,603 --> 00:30:54,604
Great.

415
00:30:54,854 --> 00:30:58,524
I don't know what you're gonna do,
because there isn't an extra key...

416
00:30:58,566 --> 00:31:01,277
...and only D.H. can get them made, so...

417
00:31:07,075 --> 00:31:11,162
There's an extra key on the windowsill
in the hallway, the landing outside the door.

418
00:31:11,245 --> 00:31:13,373
But it has to be here when D.H. needs it.

419
00:31:13,456 --> 00:31:15,792
-Why would D.H. need it?
-Fuck you!

420
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:18,753
You can stay here for a couple days
and that's it.

421
00:31:20,505 --> 00:31:23,383
Contrary to popular belief,
D.H. is my landlord.

422
00:31:23,466 --> 00:31:26,719
I'm an established artist. I work here.
My projects are supported.

423
00:31:26,761 --> 00:31:30,932
I can't afford to fuck up my relationship
with my landlord. Do you understand?

424
00:31:31,015 --> 00:31:32,558
So, let yourself in and out...

425
00:31:32,642 --> 00:31:35,019
...with the key,
but each time he reaches for it...

426
00:31:35,103 --> 00:31:36,813
-...it's there waiting for him.
-Sure.

427
00:31:36,896 --> 00:31:40,149
I don't wanna know you're here
or see any traces of you in here.

428
00:31:40,233 --> 00:31:41,234
Gotcha.

429
00:31:41,317 --> 00:31:42,819
For a couple of days.

430
00:31:45,113 --> 00:31:47,073
I'm just gonna run to the bathroom.

431
00:31:50,994 --> 00:31:52,328
So, you're an artist?

432
00:31:55,707 --> 00:31:56,916
What kind of art?

433
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,419
What do you mean, "what kind of art"?

434
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,212
I mean do you paint, or what?

435
00:32:01,296 --> 00:32:04,716
I got what you meant,
but you obviously didn't get what I meant.

436
00:32:05,008 --> 00:32:09,262
An artist creates art,
regardless of what form the canvas takes.

437
00:32:09,304 --> 00:32:12,765
-So, what do you do? Paint?
-I'm a performance artist.

438
00:32:12,807 --> 00:32:14,726
So, you don't paint.

439
00:32:18,313 --> 00:32:20,315
Rachel thinks that D.H. is going to...

440
00:32:20,356 --> 00:32:24,110
-...leave his wifey and set up house with her.
-Shut the fuck up, Russel!

441
00:32:24,152 --> 00:32:26,654
What do you think the chances of that are?

442
00:32:26,696 --> 00:32:29,073
Moneybuckets, take me away!

443
00:32:31,576 --> 00:32:35,580
Could you persuade your godfather
into letting me use one of his buildings...

444
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:37,206
...for one of my pieces?

445
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:39,792
-What would you want to do with it?
-I don't know.

446
00:32:39,876 --> 00:32:41,836
Russel is just, like...

447
00:32:43,755 --> 00:32:45,548
...very brilliant.

448
00:32:49,886 --> 00:32:52,847
-How old are you?
-I'm 18.

449
00:32:54,515 --> 00:32:56,351
I'm very close to being 18.

450
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:03,816
-Still no news on lgby?
-No.

451
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,652
He will turn up.

452
00:33:05,944 --> 00:33:07,153
<i>D.H. is...</i>

453
00:33:07,445 --> 00:33:11,324
<i>...spending more time in New York these
days than here in Georgetown, so...</i>

454
00:33:11,783 --> 00:33:13,409
...he is bound to find him.

455
00:33:13,493 --> 00:33:16,788
<i>You know, listen,
I just want you to know that if you should...</i>

456
00:33:16,871 --> 00:33:18,998
<i>...take a very bad turn...</i>

457
00:33:20,375 --> 00:33:24,253
...death, for instance...
Not to worry about the boys.

458
00:33:24,337 --> 00:33:28,007
<i>D.H. was so excited
about having them this summer...</i>

459
00:33:28,091 --> 00:33:31,260
...and, you know,
if we could be surrogates...

460
00:33:31,344 --> 00:33:35,723
...and help the boys in any way,
you know that would make us very happy.

461
00:33:35,807 --> 00:33:38,309
<i>I just want you to know that.</i>

462
00:33:38,393 --> 00:33:42,021
<i>Not to mention the fact that he's...
Over the years, he's invested...</i>

463
00:33:42,063 --> 00:33:47,026
<i>...an awful lot emotionally
and, well, financially into the boys.</i>

464
00:33:47,944 --> 00:33:49,904
<i>Igby's tuition and such.</i>

465
00:33:49,988 --> 00:33:51,948
<i>I mean, where else would you turn?</i>

466
00:33:52,198 --> 00:33:53,658
Jason?

467
00:33:54,534 --> 00:33:55,785
<i>Handsome.</i>

468
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:58,663
<i>-Handsome, sad Jason...
-Shut up.</i>

469
00:33:58,746 --> 00:34:02,000
...who so depleted your finances
and your options.

470
00:34:02,083 --> 00:34:05,086
I mean, the sacrifices
you've made to the boys...

471
00:34:05,169 --> 00:34:07,880
...l'm just, well, how...

472
00:34:07,964 --> 00:34:10,717
-How did you do it?
-Stirrups and a turkey baster.

473
00:34:21,936 --> 00:34:24,439
-Bunny?
-Yeah?

474
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:28,318
You are a feeble woman.

475
00:34:41,581 --> 00:34:43,916
Did I hear Mimi?

476
00:34:44,834 --> 00:34:46,336
She's just freshening up.

477
00:34:46,502 --> 00:34:47,754
She's freshening up?

478
00:34:48,755 --> 00:34:49,839
Mimi?

479
00:34:50,715 --> 00:34:52,425
Did she leave, D.H.?

480
00:34:52,717 --> 00:34:55,011
Without saying goodbye?

481
00:34:55,136 --> 00:34:56,679
She did leave a note.

482
00:34:56,971 --> 00:34:58,765
Of course she did.

483
00:34:59,098 --> 00:35:00,391
Sweet Mimi!

484
00:35:04,562 --> 00:35:06,940
Can't you hit D.H. up for some bucks?

485
00:35:08,149 --> 00:35:10,902
I'd ask him myself,
but I'm not having sex with him.

486
00:35:10,985 --> 00:35:13,488
-Fuck you. Get a job.
-Please!

487
00:35:14,113 --> 00:35:16,616
Things have become fragile with D.H.

488
00:35:18,242 --> 00:35:19,619
What things?

489
00:35:20,161 --> 00:35:21,162
Me.

490
00:35:21,537 --> 00:35:22,664
Russel!

491
00:35:25,667 --> 00:35:28,795
You're not even paying rent.
All you really need is pocket cash.

492
00:35:28,878 --> 00:35:30,129
I have needs.

493
00:35:30,213 --> 00:35:32,632
Russel's always looking for assistants
for projects.

494
00:35:32,674 --> 00:35:35,510
I'm sure he'd throw you work
as a favor to me. He loves me.

495
00:35:35,593 --> 00:35:37,804
Where the fuck are you?

496
00:35:37,887 --> 00:35:39,639
On one of his artworks?

497
00:35:41,057 --> 00:35:43,017
-Shit!
-Catch!

498
00:36:00,285 --> 00:36:04,122
I know you. You're that boy
from the Hamptons party.

499
00:36:06,082 --> 00:36:07,166
Iggy?

500
00:36:07,417 --> 00:36:10,628
I met you at your uncle's party.

501
00:36:10,837 --> 00:36:13,548
Igby. He's my godfather. Leave me alone.

502
00:36:14,674 --> 00:36:15,717
Igby.

503
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:17,093
What?

504
00:36:17,176 --> 00:36:18,428
Dime bag.

505
00:36:22,307 --> 00:36:24,017
That got your attention.

506
00:36:24,183 --> 00:36:25,435
Pavlov's pothead.

507
00:36:25,768 --> 00:36:28,730
I hear the sound of a bong clink
and my eyes begin to water.

508
00:36:28,813 --> 00:36:30,273
That's funny.

509
00:36:31,399 --> 00:36:32,942
Thanks.

510
00:36:33,568 --> 00:36:34,777
The park?

511
00:36:34,986 --> 00:36:36,070
Yeah.

512
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:40,950
You can't guard me, Mindy!

513
00:36:41,409 --> 00:36:43,536
C'mon, where'd it go?

514
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:44,871
Oh, shit!

515
00:36:44,954 --> 00:36:47,582
-You bitch!
-My ball, cuntface!

516
00:36:53,379 --> 00:36:56,299
-Are you a vegetarian?
-Why would you ask that?

517
00:36:56,466 --> 00:36:59,469
I've just never seen anybody
roll a joint like that.

518
00:36:59,969 --> 00:37:02,347
What does that have to do
with being a vegetarian?

519
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:04,390
They're just so precious.

520
00:37:05,475 --> 00:37:06,976
I roll perfect joints.

521
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:10,438
-I'm not putting them down. They're great.
-Thank you.

522
00:37:10,521 --> 00:37:14,317
It's incredible that a human being
could make such neat little joints.

523
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,569
You make it sound as if
I'm anal or something.

524
00:37:16,653 --> 00:37:19,822
-Just because I can roll a perfect joint.
-Not anal.

525
00:37:21,282 --> 00:37:22,283
Vegetarian.

526
00:37:22,367 --> 00:37:23,743
What does that mean?

527
00:37:23,826 --> 00:37:27,914
You don't roll
big Rasta spliff joints, do you?

528
00:37:27,997 --> 00:37:31,542
Your joints are like salad joints,
not like a big...

529
00:37:31,626 --> 00:37:36,047
...sloppy, bleeding-cheeseburger-
that-you-rip-into-kind-of-a-joint joint.

530
00:37:36,506 --> 00:37:41,427
I guess marijuana
isn't a visceral experience for me.

531
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:44,472
-Sex is for me.
-Right.

532
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:53,439
Okay, so I am a vegetarian.
But for purely moral reasons.

533
00:37:54,691 --> 00:37:57,402
I thought you went to school
at Brandeis or someplace.

534
00:37:57,485 --> 00:37:58,987
Bennington. I do.

535
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:02,073
-Why aren't you there?
-I took a semester off.

536
00:38:02,824 --> 00:38:04,617
I needed time to recuperate.

537
00:38:04,701 --> 00:38:06,077
From what?

538
00:38:08,162 --> 00:38:12,041
Entenmann's cookies,
beer, diet pills, tension...

539
00:38:12,625 --> 00:38:14,002
...life.

540
00:38:14,252 --> 00:38:17,046
My dad's been recuperating for six years.

541
00:38:17,547 --> 00:38:19,173
What do you mean?

542
00:38:19,882 --> 00:38:21,884
From life. Nothing.

543
00:38:24,721 --> 00:38:25,805
Let's go.

544
00:38:28,808 --> 00:38:30,768
You've come a long way, baby.

545
00:38:34,063 --> 00:38:35,523
You're funny.

546
00:38:51,289 --> 00:38:54,667
Hello, I'm Lt. Ernest Smith
from Pershing Academy.

547
00:38:54,709 --> 00:38:57,795
-I'm here to ask about a...
-Those are fabulous.

548
00:38:58,171 --> 00:39:00,298
-Where did you get them?
-The army.

549
00:39:00,632 --> 00:39:01,924
See, I'm regular army.

550
00:39:02,091 --> 00:39:05,553
Mrs. Slocumb found out
I was stationed in New Jersey now...

551
00:39:05,637 --> 00:39:10,183
...so she just thought that maybe lgby,
since he worked here this summer...

552
00:39:10,725 --> 00:39:12,185
Can I have these?

553
00:39:14,812 --> 00:39:16,230
No.

554
00:39:17,857 --> 00:39:21,027
I'm asking about lgby Slocumb!

555
00:39:23,529 --> 00:39:27,825
Anne Frank, the soldiers are gone.
Come out and play.

556
00:39:37,085 --> 00:39:40,213
Yum, with three "M"s.

557
00:39:43,758 --> 00:39:46,427
You have a huge crush on me, don't you?

558
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:47,720
Fuck off.

559
00:39:49,097 --> 00:39:51,557
How's your brother doing these days?

560
00:39:51,724 --> 00:39:55,520
-I don't have a brother. I'm an only child.
-Oliver's your brother, I thought.

561
00:39:55,603 --> 00:39:57,730
-He is, and yet...
-And yet what?

562
00:39:57,814 --> 00:40:00,942
I was about to say that we were
both raised only children, but...

563
00:40:01,025 --> 00:40:03,361
...that sounds like something
you would say.

564
00:40:03,945 --> 00:40:05,446
What do you do?

565
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,407
I'm preparing to leave.

566
00:40:07,699 --> 00:40:08,992
Where do you want to go?

567
00:40:09,617 --> 00:40:10,910
Far away.

568
00:40:11,619 --> 00:40:14,205
I was thinking
about joining the Peace Corps.

569
00:40:14,622 --> 00:40:17,000
Go on my "Razor's Edge" experience.

570
00:40:17,125 --> 00:40:18,710
Discover the meaning of life.

571
00:40:19,377 --> 00:40:20,628
Whatever.

572
00:40:20,712 --> 00:40:24,382
You need at least three years of college
to join the Peace Corps, don't you?

573
00:40:24,465 --> 00:40:25,466
You do?

574
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,052
Yeah. I had a friend at school who joined.

575
00:40:28,386 --> 00:40:30,346
That could be a slight snag.

576
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:32,890
I haven't even gotten around
to taking my GED yet.

577
00:40:32,974 --> 00:40:35,476
-So take it.
-I gotta go to Hackensack.

578
00:40:35,643 --> 00:40:38,938
So go! Stop procrastinating.
It's almost Christmas.

579
00:40:39,397 --> 00:40:43,401
Not going to New Jersey isn't
procrastinating. It's common sense.

580
00:40:43,985 --> 00:40:45,987
-Do you want me to go with you?
-No.

581
00:40:46,321 --> 00:40:47,530
I will.

582
00:40:50,783 --> 00:40:52,243
All right, that'd be great.

583
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:54,287
Why aren't you in school now?

584
00:40:54,412 --> 00:40:55,997
Sheer ingenuity.

585
00:40:57,165 --> 00:40:58,625
You're funny.

586
00:40:59,626 --> 00:41:03,046
Instead of saying
that someone or something is funny...

587
00:41:03,463 --> 00:41:05,465
...why don't you just laugh?

588
00:41:08,926 --> 00:41:10,678
-ls that better?
-Much.

589
00:41:13,056 --> 00:41:16,309
-Gosh, I've never been to a hideout before.
-Shut up.

590
00:41:43,127 --> 00:41:45,171
My boy...

591
00:41:45,797 --> 00:41:47,131
...you look a bit...

592
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,384
...peaked.

593
00:41:49,592 --> 00:41:51,636
I don't feel peaked.

594
00:42:04,649 --> 00:42:05,858
Say...

595
00:42:05,984 --> 00:42:07,443
...give your...

596
00:42:07,527 --> 00:42:09,737
Give your mother a call.

597
00:42:10,822 --> 00:42:13,116
Let her know you're alive, yes?

598
00:42:21,582 --> 00:42:24,210
You need to eat some red meat, my boy.

599
00:42:25,586 --> 00:42:27,171
You're all pale.

600
00:42:41,269 --> 00:42:43,771
I didn't know he was here.
The key was on the window.

601
00:42:43,855 --> 00:42:45,648
We had lunch. I let him in.

602
00:42:45,732 --> 00:42:48,610
How was I supposed to know that?
It wasn't my fault.

603
00:42:48,693 --> 00:42:51,863
-We had an agreement. You fucked up.
-lt wasn't my fault.

604
00:42:52,071 --> 00:42:53,448
You fucking idiot!

605
00:42:54,407 --> 00:42:55,742
So...

606
00:42:56,951 --> 00:42:59,120
I guess you have to pay rent this month.

607
00:43:05,918 --> 00:43:07,462
Rachel, stop.

608
00:43:30,652 --> 00:43:31,945
She's a...

609
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:34,656
...dancer who doesn't dance, and...

610
00:43:34,739 --> 00:43:37,325
...her friend is a painter who doesn't paint.

611
00:43:37,659 --> 00:43:41,245
It's kind of a boho version of
"Island of the Lost Toys".

612
00:43:43,373 --> 00:43:46,125
And she's a lot stronger than she looks.

613
00:44:39,846 --> 00:44:41,389
I broke my butt!

614
00:44:51,482 --> 00:44:54,902
<i>You know what I think about
when I'm this close to another body?</i>

615
00:44:57,405 --> 00:44:58,740
I think...

616
00:44:59,907 --> 00:45:01,117
...one day...

617
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,953
...at one moment...

618
00:45:04,746 --> 00:45:09,042
...this body that I'm holding in my arms
will stop breathing...

619
00:45:10,043 --> 00:45:11,711
...stop living...

620
00:45:12,253 --> 00:45:13,546
...just...

621
00:45:14,756 --> 00:45:15,840
...stop.

622
00:45:18,718 --> 00:45:23,890
One day, you'll see my name in the obits
and you'll remember this moment.

623
00:45:26,309 --> 00:45:28,436
You're a real fuckin' upper.

624
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:31,648
How did you end up at military school?

625
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:33,107
Mimi.

626
00:45:33,191 --> 00:45:35,068
-Mimi?
-My mother.

627
00:45:35,610 --> 00:45:37,654
You call your mother "Mimi"?

628
00:45:38,196 --> 00:45:40,031
"Heinous One" is a bit cumbersome.

629
00:45:40,114 --> 00:45:41,324
Right.

630
00:45:41,407 --> 00:45:43,368
"Medea" was already taken.

631
00:45:45,912 --> 00:45:48,623
Your mother sent you to military school?

632
00:45:49,832 --> 00:45:54,629
In all fairness to her, I did get kicked out
of most of the schools on the East Coast.

633
00:45:56,506 --> 00:46:01,469
Still, I just assumed that military school
was an empty threat, like with most parents.

634
00:46:02,303 --> 00:46:04,013
She called that bluff.

635
00:46:04,514 --> 00:46:07,267
Do you resent her for sending you there?

636
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:08,935
I'm glad I went.

637
00:46:09,644 --> 00:46:11,312
It made everything clear to me.

638
00:46:12,146 --> 00:46:13,439
Like what?

639
00:46:14,774 --> 00:46:16,109
The fight.

640
00:46:16,359 --> 00:46:18,611
-15 minutes.
-Okay.

641
00:46:18,653 --> 00:46:21,781
Downstairs, dressed,
waiting for your father, in 15 minutes...

642
00:46:21,864 --> 00:46:23,116
...or you're taking the bus.

643
00:46:23,157 --> 00:46:24,242
I know.

644
00:46:40,091 --> 00:46:41,134
Dad?

645
00:48:17,647 --> 00:48:18,898
You see...

646
00:48:20,191 --> 00:48:21,276
...lgby...

647
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:24,696
...I feel this...

648
00:48:24,904 --> 00:48:26,155
...great...

649
00:48:28,783 --> 00:48:30,034
...pressure...

650
00:48:31,869 --> 00:48:33,413
...coming down on me.

651
00:48:35,331 --> 00:48:39,711
It's just constantly coming down on me...

652
00:48:43,339 --> 00:48:44,757
...crushing me.

653
00:49:00,315 --> 00:49:05,111
You make it sound sinister. That's
what good schools are for, to shape you...

654
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:08,948
...not brainwash you
in some evil, Orwellian way, or...

655
00:49:09,157 --> 00:49:11,534
...squash you
into something you're not, but...

656
00:49:12,619 --> 00:49:15,455
I know my mother
teaches metaphysical poetry at Vassar.

657
00:49:15,496 --> 00:49:16,831
I really believe she tries...

658
00:49:16,914 --> 00:49:20,918
My father went through the system and
it told him what he was supposed to want.

659
00:49:21,210 --> 00:49:22,837
He achieved everything, and...

660
00:49:23,254 --> 00:49:24,964
...then in his 40s, he flipped.

661
00:49:25,089 --> 00:49:27,258
What did he really want?

662
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:30,136
Sunny days.

663
00:49:30,803 --> 00:49:34,057
Now Dad is in the Maryland Home
for the Befuddled.

664
00:49:35,266 --> 00:49:37,143
Cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.

665
00:49:38,519 --> 00:49:41,064
So, you're never going back to school?

666
00:49:41,272 --> 00:49:44,984
What are you planning to do with your life,
lgby? Just kill time until...

667
00:49:45,068 --> 00:49:47,153
My nervous breakdown comes along?

668
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:54,160
Is your father dead?

669
00:49:54,535 --> 00:49:56,329
No, why?

670
00:49:56,913 --> 00:50:01,376
'Cause when I talked about mine, you didn't
feel obligated to compare and contrast.

671
00:50:02,126 --> 00:50:03,795
He's a theologian.

672
00:50:04,545 --> 00:50:07,632
A Jewish theologian
and a metaphysical poetess.

673
00:50:08,508 --> 00:50:09,676
Doesn't explain you.

674
00:50:09,759 --> 00:50:11,177
What would?

675
00:50:11,678 --> 00:50:13,471
Cross-dressing psychoanalysts?

676
00:50:13,888 --> 00:50:15,181
Heroin junkies?

677
00:50:15,556 --> 00:50:17,308
-I don't know.
-Thanks.

678
00:50:18,977 --> 00:50:20,478
My parents...

679
00:50:21,062 --> 00:50:22,397
...were two...

680
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:25,483
...very idealistic, incredibly bright...

681
00:50:26,067 --> 00:50:27,193
...narcissists.

682
00:50:28,111 --> 00:50:29,821
I was like their vanity project.

683
00:50:29,904 --> 00:50:32,073
-Oh, my God.
-What?

684
00:50:32,156 --> 00:50:33,658
You torture me.

685
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:35,952
I was adopted, okay?

686
00:50:36,035 --> 00:50:37,787
That would explain everything.

687
00:50:38,329 --> 00:50:40,957
'Cause, I mean,
how many Vassar professors...

688
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:45,670
...and intellectual theologians
beget nymphomaniacal...

689
00:50:45,753 --> 00:50:47,714
...pseudo-bohemian J.A.P.s?

690
00:50:48,214 --> 00:50:50,550
Actually, a lot, probably, right?

691
00:50:53,845 --> 00:50:55,221
I'm not a J.A.P.

692
00:51:12,113 --> 00:51:15,116
-Good morning. I'm Oliver. We met at the...
-Right.

693
00:51:15,199 --> 00:51:18,119
At that party in the Hamptons.

694
00:51:18,411 --> 00:51:22,040
-You're the fascist brother.
-He prefers "Young Republican."

695
00:51:26,711 --> 00:51:28,338
I'm Sookie.

696
00:51:28,963 --> 00:51:31,007
Excuse me. I've got to...

697
00:51:31,090 --> 00:51:32,842
I'm sorry.

698
00:51:38,014 --> 00:51:40,934
-God, you're pathetic.
-Thank you, fuckwit.

699
00:51:42,101 --> 00:51:43,686
D.H. told you I was here?

700
00:51:43,978 --> 00:51:48,107
Your little vacation's about to
come to a rather abrupt and severe end.

701
00:51:48,942 --> 00:51:50,360
Come again?

702
00:51:50,443 --> 00:51:51,611
You're still a minor.

703
00:51:51,653 --> 00:51:52,737
So?

704
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:55,990
Since you're not interested
in taking care of your education...

705
00:51:56,074 --> 00:51:58,076
...measures are being taken on your behalf.

706
00:51:58,159 --> 00:51:59,494
What measures?

707
00:51:59,827 --> 00:52:01,913
Mom's coming up next weekend.

708
00:52:02,288 --> 00:52:03,373
Great.

709
00:52:03,831 --> 00:52:07,126
-I'm taking my equivalency test on Friday.
-Whatever.

710
00:52:07,168 --> 00:52:09,170
I can vouch,
because I made the appointment.

711
00:52:09,253 --> 00:52:11,005
-Really?
-Really.

712
00:52:11,631 --> 00:52:14,342
Oh, my God! It's almost the afternoon.

713
00:52:15,593 --> 00:52:16,928
Look, it was...

714
00:52:17,512 --> 00:52:20,682
-...nice meeting you. I'm gonna take off.
-Where are you headed?

715
00:52:20,765 --> 00:52:22,517
My mom's. Upper East Side.

716
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:25,311
Me, too. That's where I'm staying.

717
00:52:25,353 --> 00:52:27,438
Amidst the cobwebs and geriatrics.

718
00:52:27,522 --> 00:52:28,731
The geriatrics?

719
00:52:28,815 --> 00:52:32,151
Everyone's inferior to Ollie in some way.
Ask him, he'll tell ya.

720
00:52:32,193 --> 00:52:33,569
Let me give you a lift.

721
00:52:33,861 --> 00:52:36,948
It's a write-off for D.H.
You can't pass up a free ride.

722
00:52:38,866 --> 00:52:40,576
-Friday?
-Friday.

723
00:52:42,745 --> 00:52:43,955
See ya.

724
00:52:49,711 --> 00:52:51,838
<i>It's not his real name.</i>

725
00:52:52,171 --> 00:52:56,426
He had a stuffed bear as a kid, Digby Bear.
They were British, I think.

726
00:52:56,968 --> 00:53:00,555
And because he always got everything
wrong, he called it "lgby."

727
00:53:00,638 --> 00:53:04,559
Whenever he committed a crime,
he would say, "I didn't do it, lgby did."

728
00:53:04,892 --> 00:53:08,896
And to break him of this habit,
being as hip to child psych as she was...

729
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:12,483
...Mimi started referring to him as lgby
every time he lied.

730
00:53:12,567 --> 00:53:14,861
He lied a lot.

731
00:53:17,405 --> 00:53:20,950
So, you work for your godfather?

732
00:53:21,034 --> 00:53:23,870
Igby's, D.H., who is amazing.

733
00:53:24,287 --> 00:53:27,206
His mind functions only to make money.

734
00:53:27,498 --> 00:53:30,209
He thinks he has everything
he could possibly want...

735
00:53:30,293 --> 00:53:34,547
...so he walks around acting the way he
thinks a happy and content man should act.

736
00:53:35,048 --> 00:53:36,049
He's a parody.

737
00:53:36,132 --> 00:53:40,678
-lf he's a parody, why do you work for him?
-He's an obscenely rich parody.

738
00:53:40,762 --> 00:53:44,098
And if he wants to make me
in his image, hey.

739
00:53:46,392 --> 00:53:48,353
What does your mother do?

740
00:53:48,603 --> 00:53:52,523
She's a writer,
though mostly she just teaches now.

741
00:53:52,607 --> 00:53:53,858
Is she divorced?

742
00:53:54,108 --> 00:53:55,234
Never married.

743
00:53:55,318 --> 00:53:57,362
-How come?
-Doesn't like men.

744
00:53:57,779 --> 00:53:59,656
-Lesbian.
-No.

745
00:54:00,615 --> 00:54:03,076
Just a failed heterosexual.

746
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:08,414
Listen, thanks for the lift.

747
00:54:09,707 --> 00:54:10,875
Shit!

748
00:54:10,959 --> 00:54:13,503
What, did you lose your wallet?

749
00:54:14,504 --> 00:54:16,923
I don't have the keys
to my aunt's apartment.

750
00:54:16,965 --> 00:54:20,927
-The doorman won't let you in?
-He's totally senile, never remembers me.

751
00:54:21,010 --> 00:54:22,929
<i>I'll just wait for her.</i>

752
00:54:23,304 --> 00:54:24,764
<i>Wander around.</i>

753
00:54:24,806 --> 00:54:26,891
She'll be in this evening at some point.

754
00:54:26,975 --> 00:54:29,102
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

755
00:54:29,811 --> 00:54:32,272
-Could I use your phone?
-Sure.

756
00:54:32,313 --> 00:54:34,023
I mean, God.

757
00:54:34,107 --> 00:54:35,149
Can I get a receipt?

758
00:54:40,989 --> 00:54:42,240
Mimi...

759
00:54:43,157 --> 00:54:46,244
...had been afraid someone
would find something embarrassing.

760
00:54:47,537 --> 00:54:49,914
So up went her little soldier...

761
00:54:50,290 --> 00:54:51,958
...while she waited downstairs.

762
00:54:52,625 --> 00:54:55,044
<i>This old lady led me to his desk.</i>

763
00:54:56,296 --> 00:55:00,842
And before she left me there, made sure
to give me a nice pat on the head.

764
00:55:01,009 --> 00:55:03,511
I wanted to break her fucking hand.

765
00:55:04,804 --> 00:55:08,766
So, I sat down in my father's chair
and I started looking in his desk.

766
00:55:09,058 --> 00:55:11,227
<i>Each drawer that I opened was the same.</i>

767
00:55:11,519 --> 00:55:13,771
No books, no pencils...

768
00:55:13,855 --> 00:55:17,984
...just row upon row
of meticulously stacked cigarettes.

769
00:55:18,318 --> 00:55:19,485
Thousands of them.

770
00:55:24,866 --> 00:55:26,326
And all I could think was...

771
00:55:26,534 --> 00:55:29,996
...not the extent to which
my father's sickness had damaged him...

772
00:55:30,204 --> 00:55:31,331
...but rather:

773
00:55:31,539 --> 00:55:32,498
"Gosh...

774
00:55:33,708 --> 00:55:37,503
"...how would somebody do this without
anyone in the office being the wiser?"

775
00:55:37,629 --> 00:55:42,634
You know, not "my father's so far fucking
gone, he ain't never comin' back..."

776
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:44,969
...but just:

777
00:55:49,390 --> 00:55:53,519
"How the fuck
did he get all of these cigarettes...

778
00:55:56,230 --> 00:55:57,815
"...into this desk?"

779
00:56:00,401 --> 00:56:01,861
You were numb.

780
00:56:07,033 --> 00:56:08,493
Sookie...

781
00:56:09,035 --> 00:56:10,244
...I am numb.

782
00:57:57,936 --> 00:58:01,314
-Everything all right here, folks? You okay?
-Great.

783
00:58:01,814 --> 00:58:04,067
Excuse me! I'm sorry.

784
00:58:42,146 --> 00:58:45,108
Do you want me to give this to you
or should I hang on to it?

785
00:58:45,191 --> 00:58:48,152
I want you to pin it to my lapel
with my mittens and nametag.

786
00:58:48,236 --> 00:58:51,906
-Snippy. No bus-ride treat for you.
-Shut up!

787
00:58:53,032 --> 00:58:55,368
You're being really immature about this.

788
00:58:55,618 --> 00:58:59,914
If I'm immature, you're prenatal.
God, to be impressed by that preppy prick.

789
00:58:59,998 --> 00:59:02,500
We hung out. We're closer in age.

790
00:59:02,583 --> 00:59:04,919
He's your brother.
You act like you hate him.

791
00:59:05,128 --> 00:59:06,379
I do!

792
00:59:06,588 --> 00:59:09,090
I do hate him. He's totally hateable.

793
00:59:10,842 --> 00:59:12,885
Evil, niblet fuck.

794
00:59:18,641 --> 00:59:22,520
<i>There's been a misunderstanding.
Next fall is not good.</i>

795
00:59:22,604 --> 00:59:25,940
<i>I need my son enrolled this spring.</i>

796
00:59:27,066 --> 00:59:30,612
<i>Have you spoken to his godfather,
D.H. Banes?</i>

797
00:59:31,112 --> 00:59:33,990
<i>Igby is his favorite charity.</i>

798
00:59:34,073 --> 00:59:36,993
<i>He's sponsoring the boy, as in, financially.</i>

799
00:59:38,244 --> 00:59:43,583
What do we have to do, then,
to make it happen this spring?

800
00:59:44,917 --> 00:59:46,210
You do that.

801
00:59:46,461 --> 00:59:48,254
Thank you very much.

802
00:59:48,713 --> 00:59:49,923
Bye-bye.

803
00:59:55,845 --> 00:59:59,140
I'm goin' to California.
I need a fuckin' sunny day.

804
00:59:59,724 --> 01:00:01,059
Can I come?

805
01:00:01,434 --> 01:00:02,769
I'm serious.

806
01:00:03,269 --> 01:00:05,104
There's nothing keeping me here.

807
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:06,814
Except perhaps poverty.

808
01:00:06,898 --> 01:00:09,609
-Can't let that stop you.
-I can't.

809
01:00:10,276 --> 01:00:12,946
I've always wanted
to drive across the country.

810
01:00:13,196 --> 01:00:15,740
-Maybe this summer.
-Fuck that. I'm flying.

811
01:00:15,949 --> 01:00:18,451
-I wanna come, asshole.
-Good.

812
01:00:20,119 --> 01:00:22,747
'Cause I'd be afraid to go by myself.

813
01:00:40,932 --> 01:00:44,435
-May I freshen your drink?
-A little baby portion, please.

814
01:00:47,146 --> 01:00:48,523
Bigger baby.

815
01:00:53,403 --> 01:00:54,737
Thank you.

816
01:01:01,411 --> 01:01:03,288
I must say...

817
01:01:03,454 --> 01:01:05,790
...you have perfected the hobo look.

818
01:01:06,541 --> 01:01:10,128
You didn't buy the suit, did you?
Someone left it someplace for you?

819
01:01:10,211 --> 01:01:11,296
Dad.

820
01:01:11,629 --> 01:01:12,839
How apropos.

821
01:01:16,968 --> 01:01:18,177
I want my money.

822
01:01:18,469 --> 01:01:19,596
My money from Dad.

823
01:01:19,679 --> 01:01:21,347
I'll get it in two years, anyway.

824
01:01:21,431 --> 01:01:24,976
-So you can extend your vacation?
-I need it.

825
01:01:25,351 --> 01:01:27,020
You freed it up early for Ollie.

826
01:01:28,187 --> 01:01:31,649
Ollie graduated from high school.
He graduated at the top of his class.

827
01:01:31,733 --> 01:01:34,777
He earned it.
I'm not gonna subsidize your being a bum.

828
01:01:34,861 --> 01:01:36,904
-lt's a moot point, anyhow.
-What do you mean?

829
01:01:36,988 --> 01:01:41,075
You're assuming Jason provided for you
in the same manner he provided for Ollie.

830
01:01:41,159 --> 01:01:42,160
Yes.

831
01:01:42,243 --> 01:01:43,328
He didn't.

832
01:01:44,245 --> 01:01:45,705
You're lying.

833
01:01:46,914 --> 01:01:48,041
Darling...

834
01:01:48,499 --> 01:01:50,877
...why would I lie when I can just say "no"?

835
01:01:54,547 --> 01:01:57,634
I've had a conversation with Mr. McKaye...

836
01:01:57,717 --> 01:02:02,639
...headmaster of St. Anthony's, and in spite
of your little disappearing act this fall...

837
01:02:03,431 --> 01:02:07,602
...he has agreed to admit you
after Christmas.

838
01:02:07,685 --> 01:02:10,063
-You'll be boarding there...
-I'm not going back.

839
01:02:10,104 --> 01:02:13,066
I passed the equivalency test.
I don't have to go back.

840
01:02:13,316 --> 01:02:18,279
Of course, I don't trust you with the train
fare, so if you just look up Ollie...

841
01:02:18,529 --> 01:02:21,574
...tell him that I will reimburse him
if he buys your ticket.

842
01:02:21,658 --> 01:02:23,576
-I don't have his number.
-D.H. does.

843
01:02:25,453 --> 01:02:27,997
If it had just occurred to me
to mention it to Ollie.

844
01:02:28,081 --> 01:02:30,917
I saw him this afternoon,
for lunch, with his girlfriend.

845
01:02:30,959 --> 01:02:33,503
In fact, you just missed him,
darling, by about...

846
01:02:33,628 --> 01:02:35,421
...an hour and a half.

847
01:02:36,464 --> 01:02:37,924
His Connecticut one?

848
01:02:39,634 --> 01:02:44,472
Though I rather liked her. This is a new
one, a rather attractive New York girl, a...

849
01:02:45,098 --> 01:02:46,474
...Jewish girl.

850
01:02:56,234 --> 01:03:00,822
<i>You've reached my studio. If you want to
rent, leave your information after the beep.</i>

851
01:03:00,905 --> 01:03:02,699
<i>Otherwise, you know what to do.</i>

852
01:03:03,825 --> 01:03:06,703
<i>Honey? I hope I caught you.</i>

853
01:03:06,786 --> 01:03:10,123
<i>Guess where I am. St. Vincent's Hospital.</i>

854
01:03:10,915 --> 01:03:12,375
<i>We're having a party.</i>

855
01:03:12,458 --> 01:03:15,461
<i>Everybody is here, just fucking everybody.</i>

856
01:03:16,129 --> 01:03:17,422
<i>It's a party.</i>

857
01:03:17,964 --> 01:03:20,758
<i>A bad batch Mama sold you.</i>

858
01:03:21,050 --> 01:03:23,386
<i>But I caught you in time, right?</i>

859
01:03:24,220 --> 01:03:26,598
<i>You're not coming to this party, right?</i>

860
01:03:31,477 --> 01:03:33,438
<i>Hello, Bunny? It's lgby.</i>

861
01:03:33,646 --> 01:03:37,483
I'm in New York. Listen, is D.H. there?

862
01:03:37,859 --> 01:03:42,614
Thank you. She was by my place,
literally, seconds ago.

863
01:03:42,947 --> 01:03:45,867
She must've used in the cab
on the way home.

864
01:03:46,367 --> 01:03:49,370
My God, what's that about, right?

865
01:03:50,038 --> 01:03:52,790
A little patience, girl, huh?

866
01:03:53,333 --> 01:03:56,878
Hi. The doctor said
that she's gonna be fine.

867
01:03:57,795 --> 01:03:59,464
Out tomorrow maybe.

868
01:03:59,505 --> 01:04:02,050
Everything's taken care of.
Nothing more to do here.

869
01:04:02,258 --> 01:04:05,803
I'm Rachel's friend, Russel.

870
01:04:07,889 --> 01:04:08,932
Hi.

871
01:04:10,308 --> 01:04:12,894
Need a lift? Headed back to the loft?

872
01:04:13,561 --> 01:04:16,648
-Yeah. Thanks, D.H.
-Please.

873
01:04:20,068 --> 01:04:22,862
I'm sorry I called like that.
I didn't know what else to do.

874
01:04:22,904 --> 01:04:25,657
You did the right thing.
I'm glad we were on the island.

875
01:04:25,698 --> 01:04:27,033
Good boy.

876
01:04:27,241 --> 01:04:29,077
Very good boy.

877
01:04:39,087 --> 01:04:44,050
You know, I was the best man at your
parents' wedding. Did you know that, lgby?

878
01:04:44,384 --> 01:04:48,263
The golden couple.
That's what the paper called it.

879
01:04:48,846 --> 01:04:50,640
My boy.

880
01:04:54,102 --> 01:04:57,480
You know what I think you've been up to?
I think you've been pissing...

881
01:04:57,563 --> 01:04:59,649
...in the well from which you drink.

882
01:05:00,358 --> 01:05:02,694
That's what I think you've been up to.

883
01:05:27,885 --> 01:05:29,387
What happened?

884
01:05:30,888 --> 01:05:32,223
Breach of contract.

885
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:34,225
D.H. did this to you?

886
01:05:35,143 --> 01:05:38,271
-I didn't know he could get angry.
-He wasn't angry.

887
01:05:38,313 --> 01:05:39,981
He felt obligated.

888
01:05:41,316 --> 01:05:44,861
Not to worry. I doubt it will affect
your position as his prime punk.

889
01:05:45,278 --> 01:05:49,449
I think if Gandhi had had to hang out
with you for any prolonged period of time...

890
01:05:49,490 --> 01:05:51,951
...he'd have ended up
kicking the shit out of you.

891
01:05:52,744 --> 01:05:54,162
Fuckwit.

892
01:05:54,495 --> 01:05:55,997
Why?

893
01:05:56,164 --> 01:05:57,373
Rachel.

894
01:05:58,917 --> 01:06:00,418
You're screwing Rachel?

895
01:06:00,543 --> 01:06:02,128
You're screwing Rachel?

896
01:06:02,211 --> 01:06:04,422
Where was Rachel
when all this was going on?

897
01:06:05,381 --> 01:06:06,591
OD'd.

898
01:06:08,509 --> 01:06:10,303
Is she dead?

899
01:06:11,262 --> 01:06:12,847
St. Vincent's.

900
01:06:15,308 --> 01:06:16,809
Unbelievable.

901
01:06:18,227 --> 01:06:20,605
Mom wanted me to escort you down to DC...

902
01:06:20,647 --> 01:06:24,275
...and deliver you to St. Anthony's,
but you can't travel now.

903
01:06:24,817 --> 01:06:26,653
At least not with me.

904
01:06:27,654 --> 01:06:30,698
I'm not going. I took the equivalency test.

905
01:06:30,782 --> 01:06:32,742
-I don't have to go.
-Humor her.

906
01:06:32,825 --> 01:06:34,661
Humor me and fuck off.

907
01:06:36,371 --> 01:06:38,289
Apparently, they found another lump.

908
01:06:38,331 --> 01:06:39,332
Good.

909
01:06:53,513 --> 01:06:55,598
Say hello to Sookie for me.

910
01:07:07,402 --> 01:07:08,653
You see...

911
01:07:10,029 --> 01:07:11,531
...I have this...

912
01:07:13,866 --> 01:07:15,285
I feel...

913
01:07:15,952 --> 01:07:17,036
...this...

914
01:07:17,370 --> 01:07:18,746
...great...

915
01:07:20,999 --> 01:07:22,208
...pressure...

916
01:07:24,168 --> 01:07:25,837
...coming down on me.

917
01:07:28,172 --> 01:07:29,799
<i>It's crushing me.</i>

918
01:07:47,066 --> 01:07:50,445
It's just you and me, old man.

919
01:08:37,283 --> 01:08:38,785
Are you there?

920
01:08:40,286 --> 01:08:42,121
Oh, my God!

921
01:08:43,122 --> 01:08:46,709
I'm in the shower.
Go away. Come back later!

922
01:08:46,793 --> 01:08:49,629
-We've gotta go now. I gotta get out of here.
-What?

923
01:08:49,671 --> 01:08:53,383
We gotta go. I know we said the summer,
but we gotta go now.

924
01:08:53,675 --> 01:08:55,718
There's something that I have to tell you.

925
01:08:55,802 --> 01:08:57,804
Ollie. I know.

926
01:08:57,887 --> 01:09:01,724
-How soon can you be ready?
-I can't go with you.

927
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:03,977
Things have changed.

928
01:09:04,227 --> 01:09:06,020
They haven't.

929
01:09:06,145 --> 01:09:09,649
You're my friend!
That hasn't changed, right?

930
01:09:09,732 --> 01:09:13,278
That hasn't changed. But...

931
01:09:13,736 --> 01:09:15,530
Ollie and I are...

932
01:09:17,657 --> 01:09:19,158
We're the same age, and...

933
01:09:22,704 --> 01:09:24,789
Calm down!

934
01:09:24,831 --> 01:09:27,709
This is perfect! This is fucking perfect!

935
01:09:27,834 --> 01:09:30,420
Sookie Sapperstein
and the Young Republican.

936
01:09:30,503 --> 01:09:33,298
-Of course. How natural!
-Shut up!

937
01:09:33,339 --> 01:09:35,091
You think you're what he wants?

938
01:09:35,174 --> 01:09:38,469
You think that you fit the picture
of how he wants his life to look?

939
01:09:38,511 --> 01:09:42,098
You think that he would bring you
back to our mother as a potential wife?

940
01:09:42,181 --> 01:09:43,641
Our mother?

941
01:09:43,725 --> 01:09:46,561
She'd be nice to your face,
but the first opportunity...

942
01:09:46,644 --> 01:09:48,521
...she'd pull him aside and warn him off.

943
01:09:48,563 --> 01:09:52,233
"Mongrel children have such
a hard time fitting in, dearest!"

944
01:09:52,317 --> 01:09:54,068
Shut up!

945
01:09:54,152 --> 01:09:56,863
He will lie to you!

946
01:09:56,904 --> 01:09:59,949
He will use you up and marry some inbred...

947
01:10:00,033 --> 01:10:03,828
...Darien Frau who will beget him
all the towheaded brats he can afford.

948
01:10:03,870 --> 01:10:05,455
Go away!

949
01:10:05,538 --> 01:10:07,498
They are rigid and they are cold!

950
01:10:07,540 --> 01:10:12,045
And you don't know
they are cold to the fuckin' bone!

951
01:10:17,050 --> 01:10:19,427
I'm not going with you.

952
01:10:29,145 --> 01:10:30,521
I'm scared.

953
01:10:46,663 --> 01:10:49,916
You're just a glutton for fuckin' punishment,
aren't you, lgs?

954
01:12:01,613 --> 01:12:02,822
Russel!

955
01:12:07,827 --> 01:12:09,787
I need a job!

956
01:12:22,967 --> 01:12:24,177
<i>Hello?</i>

957
01:12:24,344 --> 01:12:25,511
Lisa Fiedler's?

958
01:12:26,846 --> 01:12:28,765
I know a girl from Baltimore.

959
01:12:29,766 --> 01:12:31,017
<i>So what?</i>

960
01:12:32,602 --> 01:12:34,520
I know a girl from Baltimore.

961
01:12:34,562 --> 01:12:36,564
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

962
01:12:37,815 --> 01:12:41,027
I know a girl from Baltimore!

963
01:12:41,152 --> 01:12:42,362
<i>So do I!</i>

964
01:12:42,779 --> 01:12:45,740
<i>Lisa, there's some guy here for you,
but he keeps talking...</i>

965
01:12:45,823 --> 01:12:47,533
<i>-Who is it?
-I don't know.</i>

966
01:12:47,617 --> 01:12:49,369
<i>He's saying something about Baltimore?</i>

967
01:12:49,452 --> 01:12:51,704
<i>-The drugs!
-The drugs!</i>

968
01:12:53,831 --> 01:12:56,501
It's me. I'm at Fiedler's house.

969
01:12:56,709 --> 01:12:59,379
She wants to know
if she can pay with a personal check.

970
01:13:00,004 --> 01:13:01,756
-You have no cash?
-No.

971
01:13:01,881 --> 01:13:05,093
I might have enough
in travelers' checks and francs.

972
01:13:05,176 --> 01:13:07,720
Her roommate
may have enough in travelers' checks.

973
01:13:07,804 --> 01:13:09,722
And francs!

974
01:13:15,853 --> 01:13:17,063
Okay.

975
01:13:18,022 --> 01:13:19,023
You'll owe us.

976
01:13:22,443 --> 01:13:25,822
Why don't you make yourself comfortable,
guy? I'll be right back.

977
01:13:31,411 --> 01:13:32,495
Miss Piggee?

978
01:13:33,413 --> 01:13:34,914
Yes?

979
01:13:35,081 --> 01:13:36,416
It's lgby.

980
01:13:38,251 --> 01:13:41,087
Ollie Slocumb's younger brother...

981
01:13:42,255 --> 01:13:45,008
Of course!

982
01:13:47,260 --> 01:13:50,430
How is Ollie? Columbia, right?

983
01:13:50,972 --> 01:13:52,056
Right.

984
01:13:52,807 --> 01:13:55,602
We're all hoping
that once he's healed from the accident...

985
01:13:55,643 --> 01:13:57,186
...that he'll be able to...

986
01:13:57,270 --> 01:13:59,939
...lead a fairly normal life
and be able to go back to a...

987
01:13:59,981 --> 01:14:00,982
Oh, no!

988
01:14:02,442 --> 01:14:03,610
What happened?

989
01:14:04,777 --> 01:14:07,447
Apparently, as far as anyone can tell...

990
01:14:07,530 --> 01:14:11,618
...he was 10-speeding a gazillion miles an
hour through Central Park...

991
01:14:11,701 --> 01:14:14,370
...racing with all the other Young Turks.

992
01:14:14,787 --> 01:14:19,751
He apparently caught his own reflection
in the handlebar mirror, and became so...

993
01:14:20,084 --> 01:14:23,129
...aroused by it
that he burst his Speedo shorts...

994
01:14:23,212 --> 01:14:27,300
...which then got caught in the gears
and just threw him on his face, splatter.

995
01:14:27,467 --> 01:14:31,930
Luckily, someone had the presence of mind
to scrape his face off the pavement...

996
01:14:31,971 --> 01:14:33,306
...and put it on ice.

997
01:14:33,389 --> 01:14:36,517
-Doctors were able to graft most of it back...
-I'm sorry.

998
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:42,315
And you...

999
01:14:43,650 --> 01:14:45,360
This is what you're up to.

1000
01:14:45,818 --> 01:14:47,487
Bigger-picture Darwinism.

1001
01:14:49,405 --> 01:14:51,366
You two know each other.

1002
01:14:51,616 --> 01:14:53,326
Wow!

1003
01:14:54,535 --> 01:14:58,289
Igby Slocumb was in my art class.
He was one of my students.

1004
01:14:58,706 --> 01:15:02,293
You used to call me Miss Piggy, didn't you?

1005
01:15:02,585 --> 01:15:03,670
Yeah.

1006
01:15:09,467 --> 01:15:11,344
Do you want me to cut this for you?

1007
01:15:17,141 --> 01:15:18,226
Fuck!

1008
01:15:22,689 --> 01:15:23,773
Lucky Charms?

1009
01:15:24,148 --> 01:15:25,149
What?

1010
01:15:25,191 --> 01:15:28,027
Fuckin' Lucky Charms!

1011
01:15:28,486 --> 01:15:29,988
I don't know.

1012
01:15:40,039 --> 01:15:41,749
Psycho bitch!

1013
01:15:44,377 --> 01:15:47,005
What did you do with her Lucky Charms?

1014
01:15:47,505 --> 01:15:48,715
Nothing.

1015
01:15:50,925 --> 01:15:52,594
She's a bit upset.

1016
01:15:53,469 --> 01:15:57,890
Her one-woman show wasn't terribly
well received at The Pyramid tonight.

1017
01:15:58,641 --> 01:16:00,018
Really?

1018
01:16:00,226 --> 01:16:02,854
The world isn't ready for Peeka!

1019
01:16:03,313 --> 01:16:05,148
-No?
-I told her.

1020
01:16:05,732 --> 01:16:08,860
Lorna Luft was just too fucking obscure.

1021
01:16:09,152 --> 01:16:11,362
People just think you're doing a bad Liza.

1022
01:16:12,071 --> 01:16:15,116
-I love Lorna.
-Me, too.

1023
01:16:22,749 --> 01:16:24,500
Your brother is looking for you.

1024
01:16:27,587 --> 01:16:29,088
Your mom is dying.

1025
01:16:29,213 --> 01:16:30,298
Yeah?

1026
01:16:33,259 --> 01:16:34,218
Yeah.

1027
01:16:35,762 --> 01:16:37,889
You know what you have to think of it as?

1028
01:16:37,931 --> 01:16:39,057
What?

1029
01:16:40,683 --> 01:16:42,852
Like an act of God.

1030
01:16:44,437 --> 01:16:47,023
If there were a God,
he'd have acted a lot sooner.

1031
01:16:47,106 --> 01:16:49,233
-What?
-Nothing.

1032
01:16:51,444 --> 01:16:54,197
-He left you a ticket.
-Excellent.

1033
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:55,740
It's non-refundable.

1034
01:16:56,240 --> 01:16:58,117
He wanted me to tell you that.

1035
01:16:58,284 --> 01:16:59,410
Dick.

1036
01:17:30,275 --> 01:17:32,277
I gotta take a piss.

1037
01:17:42,829 --> 01:17:44,122
Toilet paper?

1038
01:17:46,916 --> 01:17:47,917
Here.

1039
01:17:48,293 --> 01:17:49,460
It's Russel's.

1040
01:17:51,504 --> 01:17:53,172
How are you doing?

1041
01:17:53,923 --> 01:17:56,843
I'm pretty sensational, actually.

1042
01:17:57,969 --> 01:17:59,387
And you?

1043
01:18:00,346 --> 01:18:01,389
Good.

1044
01:18:02,098 --> 01:18:03,141
Really.

1045
01:18:04,350 --> 01:18:05,476
But...

1046
01:18:08,104 --> 01:18:09,731
How is D.H.?

1047
01:18:12,066 --> 01:18:13,526
Does he miss me?

1048
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:17,530
-I haven't spoken to him since...
-I bet he does.

1049
01:18:23,828 --> 01:18:25,914
You're cute.

1050
01:18:40,219 --> 01:18:41,429
Come on.

1051
01:18:43,306 --> 01:18:44,390
Down.

1052
01:18:55,151 --> 01:18:56,235
What?

1053
01:18:57,153 --> 01:18:58,780
Your poor mother.

1054
01:19:11,251 --> 01:19:14,337
<i>I've been hoarding Seconal
like a proper junkie.</i>

1055
01:19:14,712 --> 01:19:15,964
<i>I'm ready.</i>

1056
01:19:16,714 --> 01:19:18,716
<i>It's time to round up your brother.</i>

1057
01:19:59,340 --> 01:20:00,633
What's this?

1058
01:20:00,842 --> 01:20:02,635
An ice-cream sundae.

1059
01:20:03,595 --> 01:20:04,846
I accept.

1060
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:11,311
I'm going to DC this weekend
and kill my mother.

1061
01:20:11,728 --> 01:20:13,146
I'm shocked.

1062
01:20:15,481 --> 01:20:16,983
Ollie called me.

1063
01:20:17,900 --> 01:20:19,944
Apparently, he called everybody.

1064
01:20:19,986 --> 01:20:21,362
Stole your thunder.

1065
01:20:21,446 --> 01:20:22,905
Asshole.

1066
01:20:25,241 --> 01:20:29,287
-This must be very hard on you.
-Not as fucking hard as it's gonna be on her.

1067
01:20:29,329 --> 01:20:32,665
-You're just angry and confused.
-Oh, my God, don't do that to me.

1068
01:20:32,749 --> 01:20:35,001
-What?
-Psych 101 me.

1069
01:20:35,043 --> 01:20:38,087
You're a furious boy. I mean,
eventually you won't be a boy...

1070
01:20:38,171 --> 01:20:40,840
-...and it'll eat you up.
-Furious boy?

1071
01:20:41,174 --> 01:20:44,761
The thought
that I'm going to live my life without...

1072
01:20:44,844 --> 01:20:48,723
...ever having told her to fuck off,
is pretty goddamn infuriating.

1073
01:21:02,445 --> 01:21:04,197
Do you hate my guts?

1074
01:21:04,906 --> 01:21:06,491
For a month I did.

1075
01:21:06,699 --> 01:21:08,618
Now you're not even in my top five.

1076
01:21:09,077 --> 01:21:10,161
Good.

1077
01:21:10,370 --> 01:21:11,955
I missed you.

1078
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:16,751
My life is, I don't know.

1079
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:18,586
I'm drowning in assholes.

1080
01:21:19,796 --> 01:21:21,381
I'm your friend.

1081
01:21:24,592 --> 01:21:26,511
Listen, after...

1082
01:21:27,262 --> 01:21:29,347
I'm not coming back. Not to New York.

1083
01:21:29,889 --> 01:21:31,057
I know.

1084
01:21:33,351 --> 01:21:35,520
Can we go to your mom's apartment
and have sex?

1085
01:21:35,561 --> 01:21:36,562
No!

1086
01:21:37,063 --> 01:21:39,524
You think that'll make you
feel better? It won't.

1087
01:21:39,607 --> 01:21:42,694
It'll just make you feel really empty and sad.

1088
01:21:43,903 --> 01:21:45,863
You're better off masturbating.

1089
01:21:51,744 --> 01:21:53,413
<i>Thank you for coming down.</i>

1090
01:21:53,913 --> 01:21:56,249
Didn't want to fuck up my inheritance, did I?

1091
01:21:58,001 --> 01:21:59,961
Ollie has talked to you?

1092
01:22:03,256 --> 01:22:05,717
He explained what is to take place?

1093
01:22:05,883 --> 01:22:09,596
He said something about bludgeoning you
with a phone, but he didn't really...

1094
01:22:09,679 --> 01:22:11,556
...go into specifics.

1095
01:22:20,356 --> 01:22:24,569
The irony is that I took for granted
I'd outlive you all.

1096
01:22:24,611 --> 01:22:27,739
You'd think, in this family,
that I would be the least likely.

1097
01:22:28,573 --> 01:22:31,868
Jason, happy as a clam.
He'll live forever in the institution, you...

1098
01:22:31,951 --> 01:22:34,954
You know, just because you're dying,
I'm not going to apologize.

1099
01:22:35,038 --> 01:22:37,624
Not for anything that I've ever done.

1100
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:41,711
Why do you want me to be here, Mother?

1101
01:22:43,630 --> 01:22:45,131
Comic relief?

1102
01:23:11,658 --> 01:23:13,493
I'm going for a walk.

1103
01:23:22,835 --> 01:23:25,505
-Ollie, what are you drinking?
-Scotch.

1104
01:23:25,838 --> 01:23:27,048
Scotch!

1105
01:23:29,008 --> 01:23:31,970
-I guess D.H. told you.
-What?

1106
01:23:32,303 --> 01:23:36,516
We've decided to bump
all those incredibly prominent and...

1107
01:23:36,599 --> 01:23:41,020
...terribly chic persons that you were
expecting to speak at your memorial, and...

1108
01:23:41,187 --> 01:23:43,356
...have me speak for two hours or so.

1109
01:23:43,439 --> 01:23:45,191
What a clever idea.

1110
01:23:45,942 --> 01:23:48,236
You do understand, though,
don't you, that...

1111
01:23:48,361 --> 01:23:53,157
...it is customary in a eulogy to
at least make reference to the deceased?

1112
01:23:53,449 --> 01:23:55,243
I intend to, Mother.

1113
01:23:56,369 --> 01:23:57,829
Time permitting.

1114
01:24:03,167 --> 01:24:04,919
Are we ready?

1115
01:24:06,379 --> 01:24:07,714
Shall we do this?

1116
01:24:10,049 --> 01:24:13,595
You know, once we start, you must
get as much inside you as possible.

1117
01:24:13,678 --> 01:24:15,972
We've been through this.

1118
01:24:17,432 --> 01:24:19,684
I don't want to have to do this again.

1119
01:24:31,904 --> 01:24:36,200
Is that strawberry? I thought the idea was
to stop me from vomiting up the poison.

1120
01:24:43,833 --> 01:24:45,001
Wait.

1121
01:24:48,296 --> 01:24:51,007
I take it you know D.H. is your father.

1122
01:24:52,759 --> 01:24:53,801
No.

1123
01:24:53,885 --> 01:24:56,679
Then I'm really glad I told you.

1124
01:24:58,431 --> 01:25:00,141
Make yum-yum.

1125
01:25:20,328 --> 01:25:22,789
Much love, all right?

1126
01:26:49,042 --> 01:26:51,628
C'mon, wake up!

1127
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:00,386
Come on!

1128
01:27:07,393 --> 01:27:08,728
I'm sorry.

1129
01:27:39,259 --> 01:27:40,510
Listen...

1130
01:27:42,136 --> 01:27:45,723
Do you wanna see the body
before they come to collect it?

1131
01:27:55,108 --> 01:27:56,567
I've seen it.

1132
01:28:22,969 --> 01:28:24,137
Excuse me.

1133
01:28:31,102 --> 01:28:32,979
<i>Hello, Mrs. Hathaway?</i>

1134
01:28:34,314 --> 01:28:36,441
This is Jason Slocumb, Jr.

1135
01:28:41,237 --> 01:28:42,989
I'm afraid she can't.

1136
01:28:43,656 --> 01:28:45,199
'Cause she's dead.

1137
01:28:45,575 --> 01:28:48,870
He's always enjoyed
being the bearer of bad tidings.

1138
01:28:54,167 --> 01:28:56,419
Hello, Mrs. Bittle. It's lgby.

1139
01:28:57,545 --> 01:29:00,506
-lf you could sign this release.
-I'd love to, Mrs. Bittle...

1140
01:29:00,548 --> 01:29:02,091
...but she's dead.

1141
01:29:18,524 --> 01:29:19,817
Great job.

1142
01:29:20,360 --> 01:29:21,402
Thank you.

1143
01:29:21,903 --> 01:29:23,071
Aunt Penelope?

1144
01:29:23,863 --> 01:29:27,158
-lt's lgby.
-This all seems to be in order.

1145
01:29:28,034 --> 01:29:29,494
I'm in Washington.

1146
01:29:30,203 --> 01:29:33,206
This is for you and your helpers.

1147
01:29:33,289 --> 01:29:36,209
Thank you very much.
That's very generous of you.

1148
01:29:39,045 --> 01:29:41,923
I'm sure she'd love to, Aunt Penelope.

1149
01:29:42,006 --> 01:29:44,467
Except for one thing.

1150
01:30:05,738 --> 01:30:08,116
Yes, Aunt Penelope, I'm sure she was.

1151
01:30:09,701 --> 01:30:10,910
Tuesday.

1152
01:30:11,411 --> 01:30:12,537
Thank you.

1153
01:30:13,413 --> 01:30:14,539
Bye-bye.

1154
01:30:21,254 --> 01:30:22,714
It's ironic...

1155
01:30:24,591 --> 01:30:27,802
...that the first time
in my entire life that I feel...

1156
01:30:27,885 --> 01:30:30,847
...remotely affectionate toward her
is when she's dead.

1157
01:30:34,225 --> 01:30:36,102
You beat up her corpse.

1158
01:30:37,604 --> 01:30:39,105
After that.

1159
01:30:40,064 --> 01:30:42,942
The service is in two days.
You can stay in your old room.

1160
01:30:43,026 --> 01:30:45,194
You killed her. You bury her.

1161
01:30:46,904 --> 01:30:48,281
I'm joking.

1162
01:30:49,616 --> 01:30:53,745
Listen, I've got this discount fare, and...

1163
01:30:54,579 --> 01:30:56,873
...it'd be kinda hypocritical of me.

1164
01:30:57,290 --> 01:30:58,499
You know.

1165
01:30:59,542 --> 01:31:02,837
-You'll handle it like everything else, right?
-Right.

1166
01:31:04,923 --> 01:31:06,257
You should hate me.

1167
01:31:06,382 --> 01:31:07,634
I don't.

1168
01:31:07,759 --> 01:31:09,886
-You should.
-I don't hate you.

1169
01:31:10,011 --> 01:31:11,596
Don't be indulgent.

1170
01:31:12,055 --> 01:31:13,264
Never that.

1171
01:31:14,849 --> 01:31:18,311
-You're going to California?
-Yep. The Sunshine State.

1172
01:31:18,394 --> 01:31:21,105
Actually, Florida's the Sunshine State.

1173
01:31:21,481 --> 01:31:22,649
Really?

1174
01:31:24,484 --> 01:31:26,527
Three thousand fuckin' miles
away from here.

1175
01:31:26,778 --> 01:31:28,947
Is there a number where we can reach you?

1176
01:31:28,988 --> 01:31:30,490
We? No.

1177
01:31:30,990 --> 01:31:32,825
You'll call when there is.

1178
01:31:38,831 --> 01:31:41,459
There really isn't that much
between us, is there?

1179
01:31:42,418 --> 01:31:44,921
Just an ever-diminishing amount of blood.

1180
01:31:49,175 --> 01:31:50,218
Bye.

1181
01:31:55,390 --> 01:31:56,724
Well done.

1182
01:31:57,724 --> 01:32:07,724
