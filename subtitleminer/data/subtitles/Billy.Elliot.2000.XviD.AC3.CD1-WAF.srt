1
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:46,017
Grandma.

2
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:48,937
Your eggs.

3
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:53,984
It's Billy.

4
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,281
Come on.

5
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:17,591
Fuck.

6
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:25,390
- You been playing my records, you twat?
- I never played naught.

7
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:28,476
Knobhead.

8
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:32,480
If Dad knew you smoked that stuff,
he'd go mental.

9
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:34,441
Fuck off, will ya!

10
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:37,694
Little twat.

11
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:52,042
Here we go, Dad. Come on, man.

12
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,461
Dad!

13
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,755
Hurry up, Dad, man. We'll be late.

14
00:04:57,005 --> 00:05:00,675
I'm telling you, the whole world
will be on that picket line this morning.

15
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:03,887
Have you tidied our room? Dad!

16
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,639
There's not much coal left.

17
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:08,683
That's fine.
We'll be digging it up again next month.

18
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:11,978
Don't kid yourself.

19
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:13,855
I'm not waiting for you.

20
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:16,274
Tony!

21
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:20,362
See you down the picket line, Dad.

22
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:24,616
Leave it, Billy.

23
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:30,830
Mom would have let us.

24
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:57,607
Your 50 pence is on the fridge.

25
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:25,844
Scab, scab, scab!

26
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:39,441
- Are you sure you're not going to come?
- Am I fuck.

27
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:41,818
- It's a right load of old bollocks.
- It's not.

28
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,863
It's a load of shite, kicking people in.

29
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,531
I don't know why you bother.

30
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,283
- I'm good at it.
- Are you shite.

31
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:52,370
- Look at them gloves. They're outdated.
- They're me dad's, these.

32
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:55,540
Exactly.

33
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,002
Right, lads. Listen up here.

34
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,796
Hold it. Right.

35
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:05,342
Here.
Now, because they're using downstairs...

36
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:08,678
...as a soup kitchen
for the striking miners...

37
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:11,097
...I'm gonna let Mrs. Wilkinson...

38
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:15,060
...use the bottom end of the boxing hall
for her ballet lessons.

39
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,938
So, no hanky-panky, understood?

40
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:19,356
Yes.

41
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,525
Elliot, you're late.

42
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:25,445
Get changed and get in here.

43
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:27,989
Right then, lads.

44
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,244
Give it all you got. Round one.

45
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:40,126
Don't just stand there, Elliot.

46
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:48,593
Not again. This is man-to-man combat,
not a bloody tea dance.

47
00:07:48,844 --> 00:07:51,346
What are you doing, man? Hit him!

48
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:54,766
He's just pissing about.
Get stuck in and give him a belt.

49
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,643
He's like a fanny in a fit.

50
00:07:56,893 --> 00:08:00,272
Billy, hit him!

51
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:04,401
Jesus Christ, Billy Elliot!

52
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,319
You're a disgrace to them gloves...

53
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:09,614
...your father,
and the traditions of this boxing hall.

54
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:12,158
You owe us 50 pence.

55
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:14,536
Ho! Liberace!

56
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:18,248
Will you give it a rest?

57
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:22,127
Billy, punch bag.

58
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,596
You're not going until you do it properly.

59
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:34,890
Shit.

60
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:40,187
Give these to Mrs. Wilkinson and her class
when you're done. I'll see you next week.

61
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:43,607
Okay, girls. Left hand on the bar.

62
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:46,902
Thank you, Mr. Braithwaite.

63
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:50,322
Pretty arms.

64
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:54,284
Bottoms in.

65
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,412
Where are you looking, Susan?

66
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:01,666
Lift. Feel the music. Feel it.

67
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:05,629
In time, Debbie, please.

68
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:09,966
And one, and two, and three, and four...

69
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:13,970
...and five, six, seven, eight.

70
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:18,475
And one, and two, and three, and four...

71
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:21,520
...five.

72
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:25,357
And hold.

73
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:27,150
Hold it.

74
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,738
Support yourselves.
Don't look at me. Look ahead.

75
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:35,867
Where's your confidence? Come on.

76
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:40,956
And down.

77
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:47,087
Connie.

78
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:48,964
Oh, God.

79
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:51,174
And Debbie, eyes front.

80
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:56,012
And five, and six, and seven, and stop.

81
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:58,932
For God's sake.
Thank you, Mr. Braithwaite.

82
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:03,353
Right, into the center, girls, please.

83
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,066
Miss?

84
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:11,069
- Miss, the keys.
- Not now.

85
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:14,906
<i>Right, Mr. Braithwaite.
The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow.</i>

86
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:16,491
Fat chance.

87
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:20,245
Ready, and...

88
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:22,956
"Port de bras" forward...

89
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:25,292
...and up.

90
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:27,419
"Port de bras" forward...

91
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:29,254
...and up.

92
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:32,966
Why don't you join in?

93
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:37,304
"Port de bras" forward...

94
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,347
...and up...

95
00:10:39,598 --> 00:10:41,725
...and hold.

96
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:46,313
And three, and four,
and Debbie, straight leg...

97
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:47,814
...seven and eight.

98
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:52,402
And one, and two, and three, and four...

99
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,487
...and five... Boots off!

100
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:57,240
Seven and eight. What size are you?

101
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:01,786
- Miss, what about the keys?
- Into the center.

102
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:06,416
Go on, I dare you.

103
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,252
Prepare.

104
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:14,007
And one, and two, and three, and four...

105
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:17,677
...and five, and six, and...

106
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:21,973
And eight, and hold.

107
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:26,019
Hold it.

108
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,987
What have we got here, then?

109
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:37,739
Heel out.

110
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:40,116
Drop your hip.

111
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:41,493
Nice...

112
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:44,204
...straight leg.

113
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:46,831
Good arch.

114
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:50,252
Turn that leg out.

115
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:53,964
Right. Class dismissed.

116
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:55,799
Hometime.

117
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:59,511
Debbie, get the 50 pences.

118
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,269
- You owe me 50 pence.
- No, I don't!

119
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,105
You do.
Why don't you bring it along next week?

120
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:11,982
I can't. I'm going to boxing.

121
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:14,359
- But you're crap at boxing.
- No, I'm not!

122
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:17,612
Shut up.

123
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:21,449
I thought you enjoyed it.

124
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:27,581
Please yourself, darling.

125
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:55,358
<i>"Dancing in my tails"</i>

126
00:13:08,163 --> 00:13:11,208
He was your mom's favorite,
was Fred Astaire.

127
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,835
We used to watch him
at the Palace Picture House...

128
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:17,672
...and then dance around the front room
like lunatics.

129
00:13:17,923 --> 00:13:19,424
Marvelous!

130
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:24,554
Mind, they used to say
I could have been a professional.

131
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:28,683
Come on, Grandma. Not now.

132
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:04,052
Grandma!

133
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:07,973
It's this one here!

134
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:09,558
Grandma!

135
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:13,144
It's over here!

136
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:15,272
Tony?

137
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:19,693
- Do you ever think about death?
- Fuck off!

138
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:26,074
Night-night, then.

139
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:33,248
Plenty of boys do ballet, you know.

140
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:35,959
Do they now? What boys do ballet?

141
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:38,962
Nobody around here, but plenty of men do.

142
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:40,130
Poofs.

143
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,340
Not necessarily poofs.

144
00:14:42,591 --> 00:14:43,550
Who, like?

145
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,303
What about that Wayne Sleep?
He's not a poof.

146
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:48,305
He's as fit as an athlete.

147
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:52,559
- Bet he couldn't beat Daley Thompson.
- Maybe not in a race, but in stamina.

148
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:56,479
- Come tomorrow. You can just watch.
- I can't.

149
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,356
Gotta go to boxing, haven't I?

150
00:14:58,607 --> 00:15:01,109
Please yourself, then.

151
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:02,652
See you around.

152
00:15:02,903 --> 00:15:06,281
Aye. See ya.

153
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:22,797
Right, lads. Look sharp. Everybody out.

154
00:15:29,471 --> 00:15:31,556
Turn, turn and stop.

155
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:33,725
One, two, three. One, two, three.

156
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:35,977
Arms are in fifth.

157
00:15:36,228 --> 00:15:38,063
One, two, three.

158
00:15:38,313 --> 00:15:40,148
Turn, turn and stop.

159
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:43,902
One, two, three. Where are those arms?

160
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:46,071
- I don't know what to do.
- Follow the others.

161
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:49,741
Shut up, Debbie. One, two, three.

162
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:54,371
Nice pretty arms. And stop.

163
00:15:55,205 --> 00:15:57,833
See? I told you it takes loads of practice.

164
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:00,502
- Debbie.
- What, Mom?

165
00:16:00,752 --> 00:16:03,171
- What do you call me?
- Miss.

166
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:06,132
Shove off!

167
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:10,136
So, do we get the pleasure
of your company next week?

168
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:11,721
It's just...

169
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:13,390
...I feel like a right sissy.

170
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:18,228
Well, don't act like one.
Fifty pence, please.

171
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:26,194
If you're not coming again,
give us your shoes.

172
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:31,992
- You're all right.
- Right.

173
00:16:54,306 --> 00:16:56,558
What are you doing,
going around like creeping Jesus?

174
00:16:56,808 --> 00:16:58,018
Naught.

175
00:16:58,268 --> 00:17:01,229
They found your nanna in the Spar stores.
Where have you been?

176
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:03,023
Boxing. Where do you think?

177
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:04,608
What are you doing?

178
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:08,278
- I forgot me gloves.
- They were my dad's gloves.

179
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:12,824
You better take better care of them, okay?

180
00:17:35,597 --> 00:17:40,352
Copy down that diagram.
You only have five minutes left.

181
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:06,127
Hurry. This way.

182
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:11,466
You're going to ballet every week?

183
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:14,302
- Yeah, but don't tell.
- Why do you need to take lessons?

184
00:18:14,553 --> 00:18:17,180
Why do you think?
To get better, you divvy.

185
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,850
- Do you get to wear a tutu?
- Fuck off!

186
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,644
They're only meant for lasses.

187
00:18:22,894 --> 00:18:24,145
I wear me shorts.

188
00:18:24,396 --> 00:18:28,358
- You want to ask for a tutu.
- What for?

189
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,735
- To dance in.
- I'd look a right dickhead.

190
00:18:30,986 --> 00:18:34,531
I think you'd look wicked.

191
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:39,744
Come on.

192
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:22,662
I don't know why you're looking at that.

193
00:19:22,913 --> 00:19:27,209
You can't take that out on a junior ticket.

194
00:19:35,467 --> 00:19:38,553
Come on!

195
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:53,193
See you, then.

196
00:20:12,587 --> 00:20:15,632
<i>Okay, Billy Elliot, he's the center.</i>

197
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:18,260
<i>Right, I want you to watch carefully, girls.</i>

198
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:20,929
<i>First, arabesque.</i>

199
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:23,223
Drop your shoulders.

200
00:20:23,473 --> 00:20:28,103
Look forward, beyond your fingertips.

201
00:20:32,274 --> 00:20:34,693
There.

202
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:38,113
Right. Spin it, Mr. Braithwaite. Spin it.

203
00:20:38,363 --> 00:20:40,115
Come on! Spin it!

204
00:20:40,365 --> 00:20:42,075
Now, focus.

205
00:20:42,325 --> 00:20:45,996
Look at yourselves! Look in the mirror!

206
00:20:52,127 --> 00:20:55,046
Christ almighty! What was that?

207
00:20:55,297 --> 00:20:57,465
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

208
00:20:57,716 --> 00:21:02,053
Prepare one, and two. Strong position.

209
00:21:02,304 --> 00:21:04,764
<i>Weight on both legs.</i>

210
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:09,519
Pirouette, and down.

211
00:21:10,228 --> 00:21:13,523
Up you get.

212
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:18,862
Find a place on that bloody wall...

213
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:22,490
...and focus on that spot.

214
00:21:22,741 --> 00:21:26,286
Then whip your head round
and come back to that spot.

215
00:21:26,536 --> 00:21:27,871
Prepare!

216
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:31,333
<i>- One, and two, and...
- Fuck it.</i>

217
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:35,295
Have you got the spot?

218
00:21:37,005 --> 00:21:39,549
<i>Prepare.</i>

219
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:43,512
<i>- Prepare!
- Prepare.</i>

220
00:21:43,762 --> 00:21:46,681
Go!

221
00:21:50,101 --> 00:21:53,104
<i>Go, Billy!</i>

222
00:21:59,277 --> 00:22:02,864
What have I told you about that arm?

223
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:06,868
Right. Back to the bar.

224
00:22:17,921 --> 00:22:21,842
You look like a right wanker to me, son.

225
00:22:59,296 --> 00:23:02,215
Listen, it was just 50 pence a session,
you know.

226
00:23:02,465 --> 00:23:04,926
I can do without it.
I don't do it for the money.

227
00:23:05,177 --> 00:23:07,262
- What are you talking about?
- The boxing.

228
00:23:07,512 --> 00:23:09,764
I haven't seen
hide nor hair of Billy for months.

229
00:23:10,015 --> 00:23:13,143
I was gonna say something,
but I thought it might be embarrassing.

230
00:23:13,393 --> 00:23:15,812
First, I knew about it.
He's never got the gloves off.

231
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:21,067
Send him round to my house.
I'll knock some sense into him.

232
00:23:26,615 --> 00:23:29,951
Scab! Scab!

233
00:23:30,202 --> 00:23:33,205
Step, open and "balancé".

234
00:23:33,455 --> 00:23:34,539
<i>Balancé.</i>

235
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:39,961
Scab, scab, scab!

236
00:23:41,546 --> 00:23:45,300
Right. Let's do it again.

237
00:23:48,386 --> 00:23:51,056
Open and lift your chest.

238
00:23:51,306 --> 00:23:54,643
Let's do it again.
Thank you, Mr. Braithwaite. Step...

239
00:23:54,893 --> 00:23:56,645
<i>Open your arms. Do it.</i>

240
00:23:56,895 --> 00:23:58,146
Pay attention.

241
00:23:58,396 --> 00:24:00,941
Arms like this. All right?

242
00:24:01,191 --> 00:24:03,902
Thank you, Mr. Braithwaite. Step really...

243
00:24:04,152 --> 00:24:05,153
<i>...open.</i>

244
00:24:05,403 --> 00:24:08,823
<i>Powerful! Proud.</i>

245
00:24:12,536 --> 00:24:14,079
You're not concentrating.

246
00:24:14,329 --> 00:24:17,707
- Yes, I am concentrating.
- You're not even trying.

247
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:21,002
Can we have a go at it, Miss?

248
00:24:21,253 --> 00:24:24,422
Let's do it again.

249
00:24:27,592 --> 00:24:30,345
Listen, have you noticed anything weird
about Billy lately?

250
00:24:30,595 --> 00:24:34,641
What are you after, like, a list?

251
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:46,236
Got enough food there, scab?

252
00:24:46,486 --> 00:24:47,821
What are you doing?

253
00:24:48,071 --> 00:24:51,408
- Scabs eat well, eh?
- You're me best mate.

254
00:24:51,658 --> 00:24:56,997
First rule of a union, Gary,
you never cross a picket line.

255
00:25:01,084 --> 00:25:06,173
- We're all fucked if you forget that!
- We're fucked anyway.

256
00:25:06,214 --> 00:25:08,717
<i>In a speech to Tory MPs yesterday...</i>

257
00:25:08,967 --> 00:25:11,636
<i>...Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
referred to members...</i>

258
00:25:11,887 --> 00:25:14,723
<i>...of the striking National Union
of Mine Workers...</i>

259
00:25:14,973 --> 00:25:17,225
<i>...as the "enemy within".</i>

260
00:25:17,475 --> 00:25:20,478
<i>The speech comes following
several months of violent clashes...</i>

261
00:25:20,729 --> 00:25:24,024
<i>...between police officers
and striking miners.</i>

262
00:25:24,274 --> 00:25:28,820
- See you, then.
- Wait. Your breakfast...

263
00:25:29,321 --> 00:25:32,324
What the hell's he up to?

264
00:25:40,582 --> 00:25:43,251
One, two, three, "pas de bourrée".

265
00:25:43,502 --> 00:25:47,797
And one, two, three, and a turn.

266
00:25:48,048 --> 00:25:53,094
And one, two, three, "pas de bourrée".

267
00:26:11,446 --> 00:26:13,865
You, out!

268
00:26:14,115 --> 00:26:15,116
Now!

269
00:26:15,367 --> 00:26:18,787
I beg your pardon?

270
00:26:21,164 --> 00:26:24,000
Please, Miss.

271
00:26:24,334 --> 00:26:26,920
Don't.

272
00:26:35,637 --> 00:26:37,889
All right, which way are we facing?
Come on.

273
00:26:38,139 --> 00:26:39,891
And one...

274
00:26:40,141 --> 00:26:43,061
...two, three, "pas de bourrée".

275
00:26:43,311 --> 00:26:44,938
Ballet?

276
00:26:45,188 --> 00:26:46,731
What's wrong with ballet?

277
00:26:46,982 --> 00:26:48,567
What's "wrong" with ballet?

278
00:26:48,817 --> 00:26:50,861
It's perfectly normal.

279
00:26:51,111 --> 00:26:54,072
"Perfectly normal"?

280
00:26:54,447 --> 00:26:56,241
I used to go to ballet.

281
00:26:56,491 --> 00:26:57,659
See?

282
00:26:57,909 --> 00:26:59,703
Aye, for your nanna.

283
00:26:59,953 --> 00:27:03,165
For girls, not for lads, Billy.

284
00:27:03,415 --> 00:27:07,002
Lads do football, or...

285
00:27:07,037 --> 00:27:09,963
...boxing, or...

286
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:12,090
...wrestling.

287
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:16,595
Not frigging ballet.

288
00:27:18,346 --> 00:27:21,641
What lads do wrestling?

289
00:27:22,017 --> 00:27:23,810
Don't start.

290
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:26,062
I don't see what's wrong with it.

291
00:27:26,313 --> 00:27:28,106
You know exactly what's wrong with it.

292
00:27:28,356 --> 00:27:30,150
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

293
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:34,321
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you bloody well do.

294
00:27:34,571 --> 00:27:37,574
Who do you think I am?

295
00:27:37,824 --> 00:27:41,036
You know quite nicely.

296
00:27:41,828 --> 00:27:44,247
What?

297
00:27:44,498 --> 00:27:48,126
What are you trying to say, Dad?

298
00:27:50,462 --> 00:27:53,131
- You're asking for a hiding, son.
- I'm not, honest.

299
00:27:53,381 --> 00:27:55,133
You are, Billy.

300
00:27:55,383 --> 00:27:59,554
It's not just poofs, Dad.
Some ballet dancers are as fit as athletes.

301
00:27:59,804 --> 00:28:04,392
What about that Wayne Sleep?
He was a ballet dancer.

302
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:08,647
- Wayne Sleep?
- Aye.

303
00:28:08,897 --> 00:28:13,527
Listen, son, from now on
you can forget about the fucking ballet.

304
00:28:13,777 --> 00:28:16,404
You can forget about the fucking boxing,
as well.

305
00:28:16,655 --> 00:28:19,366
I'm busting my ass for those 50 pences,
and you're...

306
00:28:19,616 --> 00:28:22,494
No, from now on you stay here,
you look after your nanna.

307
00:28:22,744 --> 00:28:25,413
Got it?

308
00:28:26,915 --> 00:28:29,501
Good.

309
00:28:32,003 --> 00:28:35,507
They used to say I could've been
a professional dancer, with some training.

310
00:28:35,757 --> 00:28:38,885
Will you shut up?

311
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:42,681
I hate you!

312
00:28:42,931 --> 00:28:45,892
You're a bastard!

313
00:28:53,149 --> 00:28:56,027
Get off!

314
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:59,322
Billy!

315
00:30:09,184 --> 00:30:11,735
Hello.

316
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:13,813
My dad'll kill me if he knows I'm here.

317
00:30:14,064 --> 00:30:17,901
He's stopped you coming to classes.

318
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,945
It's not his fault, Miss.

319
00:30:20,195 --> 00:30:22,822
That's all right with you, is it?

320
00:30:23,073 --> 00:30:25,116
I suppose so.

321
00:30:25,367 --> 00:30:26,701
You should stand up to him.

322
00:30:26,952 --> 00:30:29,788
You don't know what he's like.

323
00:30:30,038 --> 00:30:32,457
Well, that blows it.

324
00:30:32,707 --> 00:30:36,419
- Blows what, Miss?
- Debbie.

325
00:30:38,255 --> 00:30:43,343
I've heard a lot about you.
Durham's little Gene Kelly, eh?

326
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:45,178
Your dad worked down the pit, then?

327
00:30:45,428 --> 00:30:46,263
Yeah.

328
00:30:46,513 --> 00:30:48,723
Must be hard for the family,
being on strike.

329
00:30:48,974 --> 00:30:51,560
He is out on strike, isn't he?

330
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:52,602
Of course.

331
00:30:52,853 --> 00:30:54,938
I shouldn't worry. They won't last long.

332
00:30:55,188 --> 00:30:56,314
Tom, don't.

333
00:30:56,565 --> 00:31:01,236
If they voted, they'd be back tomorrow.
It's just a few commies, stirring things up.

334
00:31:01,486 --> 00:31:03,864
Let's face it,
they haven't got a leg to stand on.

335
00:31:04,114 --> 00:31:05,866
Who doesn't?

336
00:31:06,116 --> 00:31:07,868
The miners.

337
00:31:08,118 --> 00:31:09,536
It stands to reason.

338
00:31:09,786 --> 00:31:11,746
Some pits are just uneconomical.

339
00:31:11,997 --> 00:31:14,749
If it costs more to pay everybody
to dig the coal out...

340
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,878
...than you get for it when you sell it,
what does that say?

341
00:31:18,128 --> 00:31:19,462
I don't know.

342
00:31:19,713 --> 00:31:22,465
You wanna think about that,
don't you, son?

343
00:31:22,716 --> 00:31:23,592
Tom.

344
00:31:23,842 --> 00:31:27,012
If it was up to me,
I'd shut them all down tomorrow.

345
00:31:27,262 --> 00:31:29,681
For God's sake.

346
00:31:29,931 --> 00:31:31,808
What do you do, Mr. Wilkinson?

347
00:31:32,058 --> 00:31:35,520
He's been made redundant.

348
00:31:40,358 --> 00:31:42,861
- I thought he was gonna hit me.
- Don't be silly.

349
00:31:43,111 --> 00:31:45,614
He's just under a lot of pressure.

350
00:31:45,864 --> 00:31:49,409
That's what Mom says.
I think it's because he drinks too much.

351
00:31:49,659 --> 00:31:51,244
Does he drink too much?

352
00:31:51,495 --> 00:31:54,164
He's always pissed.
Once he pissed himself.

353
00:31:54,414 --> 00:31:55,332
Your dad?

354
00:31:55,582 --> 00:31:59,002
'Cause he's unhappy and that.
'Cause they sleep in separate beds.

355
00:31:59,252 --> 00:32:02,797
- Why do they sleep in separate beds?
- So they can't have sex.

356
00:32:03,048 --> 00:32:04,424
Do they not have sex?

357
00:32:04,674 --> 00:32:09,971
Dad did it with this woman from work,
but they don't think I know.

358
00:32:12,015 --> 00:32:14,809
Do you miss your mom, then?

359
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:17,103
I don't really miss her as such.

360
00:32:17,354 --> 00:32:20,232
It's more like just feeling sad.

361
00:32:20,482 --> 00:32:23,485
Especially when I remember her
all of a sudden.

362
00:32:23,735 --> 00:32:26,696
When I'd forgot that she was dead
and that.

363
00:32:26,947 --> 00:32:29,407
What about your mom?
Does she not have sex?

364
00:32:29,658 --> 00:32:32,744
No, she's unfulfilled.
That's why she does dancing.

365
00:32:32,994 --> 00:32:35,413
She does dancing instead of sex?

366
00:32:35,664 --> 00:32:39,584
- Your family's weird.
- No, they're not.

367
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:45,924
They are though. They're mental.

368
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:54,641
Get off!

369
00:33:13,034 --> 00:33:15,912
See? You're a nutter, you.

370
00:33:16,163 --> 00:33:20,167
Debbie, it's time for Billy to go home.

371
00:33:20,417 --> 00:33:22,836
Come on, Billy.
I'll drop you off at the corner.

372
00:33:23,086 --> 00:33:26,214
I'll see you, Debbie.

373
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,150
Okay, then.

374
00:33:55,076 --> 00:33:56,536
Miss...

375
00:33:56,786 --> 00:34:00,248
...what have I blown?

376
00:34:03,376 --> 00:34:05,420
This'll sound strange, Billy...

377
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:11,176
...but, for some time now,
I've thought of the Royal Ballet School.

378
00:34:12,302 --> 00:34:13,845
Aren't you a bit old?

379
00:34:14,095 --> 00:34:16,556
No, not me. You.

380
00:34:16,806 --> 00:34:19,768
I'm the bloody teacher.

381
00:34:20,018 --> 00:34:22,687
They hold auditions in Newcastle.

382
00:34:22,938 --> 00:34:25,357
I'd never be good enough.
I hardly know aught.

383
00:34:25,607 --> 00:34:27,776
They're not interested
in how much you know.

384
00:34:28,026 --> 00:34:30,612
They'll teach you.
That's why they're a ballet school.

385
00:34:30,862 --> 00:34:34,407
It's how you move,
how you express yourself that's important.

386
00:34:34,658 --> 00:34:36,159
Express what?

387
00:34:36,409 --> 00:34:40,372
I think you're good enough to go for it.

388
00:34:44,459 --> 00:34:46,711
It would mean an awful lot of hard work.

389
00:34:46,962 --> 00:34:48,922
But I'm banned.

390
00:34:49,172 --> 00:34:52,050
- Maybe I should have a word with him.
- No, Miss!

391
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:55,762
- I could teach you on your own.
- We couldn't afford it.

392
00:34:56,012 --> 00:34:58,932
- I'm not doing it for the money.
- What about Dad?

393
00:34:59,182 --> 00:35:01,226
- He doesn't need to know.
- What about boxing?

394
00:35:01,476 --> 00:35:04,771
Listen, if you wanna piss about
with your mates, that's fine with me.

395
00:35:05,021 --> 00:35:08,650
All right, don't lose your blob.

396
00:35:09,025 --> 00:35:11,695
"Blob"?

397
00:35:15,157 --> 00:35:17,325
So, we could do it private like?

398
00:35:17,576 --> 00:35:20,453
Just you and me.

399
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,379
Miss, you don't fancy me, do you?

400
00:35:30,297 --> 00:35:32,674
No, Billy. Funnily enough, I don't.

401
00:35:32,924 --> 00:35:35,802
Now, piss off.

402
00:35:38,305 --> 00:35:41,308
Piss off yourself.

403
00:35:43,602 --> 00:35:46,938
See you Monday, then.

404
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,210
You coming in or what?

405
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:13,006
- What are you doing?
- Nothing. Just dressing up.

406
00:36:15,842 --> 00:36:19,429
- Whose dress is that?
- Come on.

407
00:36:26,478 --> 00:36:30,357
- Whose dress is that?
- It's me sister's.

408
00:36:30,607 --> 00:36:32,567
- Did she give you it?
- She doesn't know.

409
00:36:32,817 --> 00:36:35,612
Do you wanna try?
You can have one of me mom's.

410
00:36:35,862 --> 00:36:39,699
No. You all right?

411
00:36:43,954 --> 00:36:48,667
- What are you doing that for?
- I'm just trying it on.

412
00:36:50,168 --> 00:36:51,837
Christ.

413
00:36:52,087 --> 00:36:55,090
Come here.

414
00:36:56,049 --> 00:36:58,802
Stay still.

415
00:37:00,011 --> 00:37:01,054
There.

416
00:37:01,304 --> 00:37:03,765
- Won't we get in trouble?
- Don't be stupid.

417
00:37:04,015 --> 00:37:05,517
Me dad does it all the time.

418
00:37:05,767 --> 00:37:07,519
He dresses up in your mom's clothes?

419
00:37:07,769 --> 00:37:10,814
Only when he thinks everybody's out.

420
00:37:11,064 --> 00:37:13,692
Have you got a tutu yet?

421
00:37:13,942 --> 00:37:17,362
Do you think being a ballet dancer
would be better than being a miner?

422
00:37:17,612 --> 00:37:19,072
I don't know.

423
00:37:19,322 --> 00:37:22,868
It's just, I've got this audition
in Newcastle, in a couple of weeks.

424
00:37:23,118 --> 00:37:25,745
- What for?
- To go to ballet school.

425
00:37:25,996 --> 00:37:29,040
Ballet school? Is that in Newcastle?

426
00:37:29,291 --> 00:37:30,625
London.

427
00:37:30,876 --> 00:37:33,795
You'd have to move
with your Tony and everybody?

428
00:37:34,045 --> 00:37:37,591
- No, by myself.
- That's a bit steep.

429
00:37:37,841 --> 00:37:41,720
- Can't you be a ballet dancer here?
- Don't be stupid.

430
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:44,055
- When are you going there?
- I don't know.

431
00:37:44,306 --> 00:37:45,932
I haven't even got in yet.

432
00:37:46,183 --> 00:37:49,644
What does your dad say?

433
00:37:50,478 --> 00:37:52,522
- He doesn't know.
- Fucking hell.

434
00:37:52,772 --> 00:37:55,775
- Are you not going to tell him?
- Not yet, anyway.

435
00:37:56,026 --> 00:37:58,570
He might be pleased about it.
He could rent your room.

436
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:02,449
He couldn't. What about our Tony?

437
00:38:02,532 --> 00:38:05,577
What do you reckon?

438
00:38:07,913 --> 00:38:09,581
I think you shouldn't bother.

439
00:38:09,831 --> 00:38:11,291
Why not?

440
00:38:11,541 --> 00:38:13,710
I'd miss ya.

441
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,922
Fucking hell.

442
00:38:44,825 --> 00:38:47,911
Brought your things?

443
00:38:49,663 --> 00:38:51,623
I don't know if they're right, Miss.

444
00:38:51,873 --> 00:38:54,960
If they're special to you, they're right.

445
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:56,711
What are they for?

446
00:38:56,962 --> 00:38:59,089
To give us some ideas for a dance.

447
00:38:59,339 --> 00:39:03,134
Come on, then. Let's see them.

448
00:39:33,498 --> 00:39:35,041
What's that?

449
00:39:35,292 --> 00:39:37,210
It's a letter.

450
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:40,714
I can see it's a letter.

451
00:39:41,339 --> 00:39:43,592
It's me mom's.

452
00:39:43,842 --> 00:39:45,594
She wrote it, for when I was 18...

453
00:39:45,844 --> 00:39:49,347
...but I opened it.

454
00:39:55,395 --> 00:39:58,023
Here.

455
00:40:16,208 --> 00:40:19,836
"To my son, Billy. "

456
00:40:21,379 --> 00:40:23,465
"Dear Billy:

457
00:40:23,715 --> 00:40:27,177
I know I must seem
like a distant memory to you...

458
00:40:27,427 --> 00:40:30,055
...which is probably a good thing. "

459
00:40:30,305 --> 00:40:33,058
"It will have been a long time...

460
00:40:33,308 --> 00:40:35,435
...and I will have missed seeing you grow. "

461
00:40:35,685 --> 00:40:38,730
"Missed you crying, laughing...

462
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:41,983
...and shouting. "

463
00:40:43,652 --> 00:40:46,696
"I will have missed telling you off. "

464
00:40:46,947 --> 00:40:51,159
"But please know that I was always there. "

465
00:40:53,286 --> 00:40:55,455
"With you through everything. "

466
00:40:55,705 --> 00:40:59,376
"With you through everything. "

467
00:40:59,459 --> 00:41:02,295
"I always will be. "

468
00:41:02,546 --> 00:41:05,674
"And I am proud to have known you. "

469
00:41:05,924 --> 00:41:09,678
"And I'm proud that you were mine. "

470
00:41:09,803 --> 00:41:12,848
"Always be yourself. "

471
00:41:13,098 --> 00:41:17,018
"I'll love you forever. "

472
00:41:19,062 --> 00:41:21,857
"Mom. "

473
00:41:30,991 --> 00:41:35,078
She must have been a very special woman,
your mother.

474
00:41:35,328 --> 00:41:38,832
No, she was just me mom.

475
00:41:39,374 --> 00:41:42,878
I brought a tape and all.

476
00:41:43,295 --> 00:41:46,339
<i>- What is it?
- I Love to Boogie.</i>

477
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:49,843
It's one of our Tony's.

478
00:42:13,033 --> 00:42:14,951
Spin it!

479
00:42:15,202 --> 00:42:17,871
Go on!

480
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:34,221
Tap, tap.

481
00:42:34,471 --> 00:42:36,932
Go!

482
00:43:34,406 --> 00:43:38,118
Grandma, teatime.

483
00:43:50,172 --> 00:43:51,965
Where are you going?

484
00:43:52,215 --> 00:43:54,217
Go back to sleep.

485
00:43:54,467 --> 00:43:57,429
It's 4:00.

486
00:44:24,831 --> 00:44:27,751
You weren't thinking of taking it with you?

487
00:44:28,001 --> 00:44:29,461
If you just wanna stand around...

488
00:44:29,711 --> 00:44:32,297
...getting the shit kicked out of you,
that's fine.

489
00:44:32,547 --> 00:44:37,093
- Some of us are ready to fight back.
- They're already after you.

490
00:44:37,344 --> 00:44:39,054
You're no good to us in jail.

491
00:44:39,304 --> 00:44:40,805
I don't plan on getting caught.

492
00:44:41,056 --> 00:44:43,892
- What's going on?
- Get back to bed.

493
00:44:44,142 --> 00:44:45,477
Both of you!

494
00:44:45,727 --> 00:44:48,939
Fuck you.

495
00:44:49,731 --> 00:44:51,316
Put it down.

496
00:44:51,566 --> 00:44:53,527
- You gonna stop me?
- I'm warning you.

497
00:44:53,777 --> 00:44:55,821
You haven't got it in you. You're finished!

498
00:44:56,071 --> 00:44:59,699
Since Mom died, you're a useless twat.
What are you gonna do about it?

499
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:03,620
Stop it!

500
00:45:35,819 --> 00:45:40,115
What the fuck are you looking at?

501
00:45:40,365 --> 00:45:43,410
You haven't been practicing.

502
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:44,870
Prepare.

503
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:49,958
One, two, and one, and two.

504
00:45:50,208 --> 00:45:52,377
Get up.

505
00:45:52,627 --> 00:45:55,797
Miss, I can't do it.

506
00:45:56,047 --> 00:45:58,592
That's because you're not concentrating.

507
00:45:58,842 --> 00:46:01,136
I am concentrating.

508
00:46:01,386 --> 00:46:04,222
- You're not even trying.
- I am, Miss.

509
00:46:04,472 --> 00:46:07,934
- Do it again.
- I can't.

510
00:46:08,185 --> 00:46:12,814
You do it again.

511
00:46:19,362 --> 00:46:22,073
No!

512
00:46:28,997 --> 00:46:32,000
Shit.

513
00:46:52,521 --> 00:46:53,396
I'm sorry.

514
00:46:53,647 --> 00:46:57,359
It's all right for you.
It's not you who has to do it.

515
00:46:57,609 --> 00:46:59,528
- I know.
- You don't know anything!

516
00:46:59,778 --> 00:47:03,448
What do you know in your posh house,
with your husband that pisses himself?

517
00:47:03,698 --> 00:47:07,327
You're the same as everybody else.
All you want is to tell me what to do!

518
00:47:07,577 --> 00:47:09,496
Now, wait a minute.

519
00:47:09,746 --> 00:47:12,290
I don't want to do your stupid,
fucking audition.

520
00:47:12,541 --> 00:47:15,001
You only want me to do it
for your own benefit!

521
00:47:15,252 --> 00:47:16,127
Look, Billy...

522
00:47:16,378 --> 00:47:19,840
- Because you're a failure!
- Don't you dare talk to me like that.

523
00:47:20,090 --> 00:47:22,133
You don't even have
a proper dancing school.

524
00:47:22,384 --> 00:47:24,302
You're stuck in some crummy boxing hall!

525
00:47:24,553 --> 00:47:29,182
Don't pick on me
because you fucked up your own life!

526
00:48:12,225 --> 00:48:13,768
<i>Can I put a tape on, Miss?</i>

527
00:48:14,019 --> 00:48:17,731
<i>All right, if you must.</i>

528
00:48:57,854 --> 00:49:01,316
It's cush, isn't it?

529
00:49:02,943 --> 00:49:05,904
So, is there a story, then, Miss?

530
00:49:06,154 --> 00:49:08,156
Of course.

531
00:49:08,406 --> 00:49:12,953
It's about a woman
who's captured by an evil magician.

532
00:49:13,203 --> 00:49:15,664
Sounds crap.

533
00:49:15,914 --> 00:49:18,708
And this woman, this beautiful woman...

534
00:49:18,959 --> 00:49:22,587
...is forced to be a swan...

535
00:49:22,838 --> 00:49:25,924
...except for a few hours every night...

536
00:49:26,174 --> 00:49:29,219
...when she becomes alive.

537
00:49:29,469 --> 00:49:33,348
When she becomes real again.

538
00:49:35,183 --> 00:49:37,978
And then, one night...

539
00:49:38,228 --> 00:49:41,648
...she meets this young prince...

540
00:49:41,898 --> 00:49:45,610
...and he falls in love with her.

541
00:49:46,069 --> 00:49:48,738
And she realizes...

542
00:49:48,989 --> 00:49:51,908
...this is the one thing that will allow her...

543
00:49:52,159 --> 00:49:56,204
...to become a real woman once more.

544
00:49:56,830 --> 00:49:59,166
So then what happens?

545
00:49:59,416 --> 00:50:03,086
He promises to marry her
and goes off with someone else, of course.

546
00:50:03,336 --> 00:50:05,005
So she has to be a swan for good?

547
00:50:05,255 --> 00:50:07,132
She dies.

548
00:50:07,382 --> 00:50:09,009
'Cause the prince didn't love her?

549
00:50:09,259 --> 00:50:11,845
Come on. It's time to go.

550
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:15,599
It's only a ghost story.

551
00:50:16,433 --> 00:50:19,394
Come on.

552
00:50:49,799 --> 00:50:52,761
It's me.

553
00:50:54,095 --> 00:50:57,057
It's Billy.

554
00:50:58,850 --> 00:51:02,354
Oh, little one.

555
00:51:24,751 --> 00:51:26,753
Oh, little one...

556
00:51:27,003 --> 00:51:29,756
...what have I told you
about drinking out of the bottle?

557
00:51:30,006 --> 00:51:32,968
Sorry, Mom.

558
00:51:40,684 --> 00:51:44,145
Well, put it back.

559
00:52:02,581 --> 00:52:04,124
One.

560
00:52:04,374 --> 00:52:05,959
Lift...

561
00:52:06,209 --> 00:52:08,628
...and reach.

562
00:52:08,879 --> 00:52:12,340
Down, and one.

563
00:52:12,591 --> 00:52:17,012
Breathe and stretch.

564
00:52:17,262 --> 00:52:19,222
And one.

565
00:52:19,472 --> 00:52:23,685
Lift and stretch.

566
00:52:26,229 --> 00:52:27,147
Lift...

567
00:52:27,397 --> 00:52:29,858
...and lengthen that foot.

568
00:52:30,108 --> 00:52:33,487
And it's one.

569
00:52:34,237 --> 00:52:37,449
Extend.

570
00:52:37,824 --> 00:52:40,619
Reach out.

571
00:52:40,869 --> 00:52:45,415
Lift and breathe.

572
00:52:46,041 --> 00:52:48,585
And one.

573
00:52:48,835 --> 00:52:50,253
Lift.

574
00:52:50,504 --> 00:52:53,632
Out and close.

575
00:52:53,882 --> 00:52:56,009
And one.

576
00:52:56,259 --> 00:52:59,262
Lift.

577
00:53:34,297 --> 00:53:36,007
When's the audition, then?

578
00:53:36,258 --> 00:53:39,219
Tomorrow morning.

579
00:53:39,386 --> 00:53:41,388
I'll miss you if you go away.

580
00:53:41,638 --> 00:53:46,476
Who do you think is better,
Fred Astaire or Ginger Rogers?

581
00:53:46,893 --> 00:53:50,564
Billy, do you not fancy us, like?

582
00:53:52,691 --> 00:53:56,778
Don't know. Never really thought about it.

583
00:54:01,575 --> 00:54:05,537
If you want, I'll show you me fanny.

584
00:54:11,001 --> 00:54:14,796
No. You're all right.

585
00:54:36,902 --> 00:54:38,528
- Get inside.
- Come on.

586
00:54:38,778 --> 00:54:42,782
That's the union leader. Get him!

587
00:54:43,867 --> 00:54:46,995
Get down!

588
00:55:06,389 --> 00:55:09,351
Thanks, pet.

589
00:55:15,649 --> 00:55:18,819
Wanker!

590
00:55:24,157 --> 00:55:27,160
Keep away from there, son.

591
00:55:27,410 --> 00:55:30,413
Shit.

592
00:55:44,302 --> 00:55:47,764
Here they come!

593
00:55:58,567 --> 00:56:01,236
Fuck!

594
00:56:08,410 --> 00:56:11,079
Tony!

595
00:56:13,123 --> 00:56:16,501
Tony, come back!

596
00:56:31,183 --> 00:56:35,270
Take him away. Off you go, mate.
