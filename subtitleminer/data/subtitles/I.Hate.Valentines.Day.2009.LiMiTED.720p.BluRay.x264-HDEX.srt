1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,800
What's with this guy?
Hey!

2
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,400
You see me here?
I'm walking!

3
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,400
Hey, I like your short skirt.

4
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,500
I like your buns.

5
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:47,500
Genevieve, I'm on Date Four
and I'm outta ideas.

6
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,900
<i>- Water-taxi tour of the bridges.
- Thank you!</i>

7
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,500
- How you doing, Genevieve?
- Hi.

8
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,600
Valentine's Day.

9
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,600
I'm telling you,
he'd better buy you something.

10
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You know what? Valentine's Day
is just a dumb made-up holiday.

11
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,200
I love Valentine's Day.

12
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,900
Yeah? Well, I don't know
one guy who does.

13
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,100
It sucks!

14
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,200
- Hi, crazy.
- Hi, Bill and Bob.

15
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,500
- Oops.
- Uh-oh.

16
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,700
- Good morning.
- Not with these eyebrows.

17
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:19,800
Let's see.

18
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,900
- They've gone G.I. Joe.
- Help me.

19
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,600
Very Madonna.

20
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,000
- Swears?
- Her eighties phase.

21
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,000
The second time,
in two thousand seven.

22
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,300
Yes, well, Madonna post-tour
for sure.

23
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,300
Yeah, long tour.
Eyebrows grow back.

24
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,800
Hey, my eyebrows grow back fast.

25
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,600
Pluck the hair
and there's nothing there.

26
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,700
- Oops.
- Uh-oh.

27
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,400
Good morning.
How're my ladies?

28
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,500
- Tim! Tim, delivered.
- Tim, hi.

29
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,300
Well, Tim, that shirt...

30
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,900
Iooks a lot less wrinkled
than normal.

31
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,600
Is it, I dare say, ironed?

32
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:13,400
- Are you trying to impress someone?
- Yeah, you. Give me a dirty kiss.

33
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,700
Let's see if you can turn me.

34
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,400
I can't!

35
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,400
Give me that.

36
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,600
I take that.

37
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,600
- What would you do without them?
- Oops and Uh-oh?

38
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,900
<i>- Oops.
- Uh-oh.</i>

39
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,600
Lose my mind.
How's it going for you?

40
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,700
Lexy and Dominique
have that flu.

41
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,600
Now I think Annie is getting it.
She's crabby.

42
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,200
- 'Cause she's sick?
- No, 'cause she's Annie.

43
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,900
You know, I've gotta do something for
Valentine's Day. I'm freaking out.

44
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,200
I'll wrap up a dozen roses
with some chocolate hearts.

45
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,300
Is that enough?

46
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,600
Yeah. All women want to know is that
you put some thought into it.

47
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,600
How many men are gonna
wake up in a cold sweat tomorrow?

48
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,500
They wait till the last moment
they put if off...

49
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,500
then they're on their way home
and everything's closed...

50
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,100
and they're panicking
in a Seven-Eleven...

51
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,200
saying, "Do you have any chocolates
in a heart shaped box?"

52
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,100
Yeah, my wife's gonna love my gut
'cause I'm more romantic?

53
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,200
Yes.

54
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,700
Less vitamins, okay?

55
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,600
Are my eyebrows holding up?

56
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,200
Hey, will you do mine? I have date
Number One tomorrow with a cute new guy.

57
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,100
- New guy!
- Let me get you those roses.

58
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,200
What happened to the other guy?

59
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,000
- Five dates.
- So it's over.

60
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,400
- Ends it before the guy can.
- Got the safety set on her heart.

61
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,400
- That's a country song.
- From her album, "Fear of Commitment".

62
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,500
Hi. Guess what?
I can hear you.

63
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,600
It is not wrong that I want every day
to be Valentine's Day.

64
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,700
- No!
- Here you go.

65
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,200
- For Annie.
- Thank you, thank you, thank you.

66
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,700
All right, you guys.

67
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,500
Dress up again for us tomorrow.

68
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,300
- Yeah, maybe I'll wear deodorant.
- Why start now?

69
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,300
Have a nice day.

70
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,200
Okay, we've got to reorganize this
fridge. Just move that over there...

71
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,100
move this over here.
It's gonna be crazy in here tomorrow.

72
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:16,200
Uh-uh, I call shotgun.
Hi.

73
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm Genevieve.
May I help you?

74
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,400
Hi.

75
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:24,900
I saw you at the old pizza place.

76
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,900
What? You're not thinking
of buying it, are you?

77
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,100
It's been a ribs place
and a chicken wings place...

78
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,400
and everybody goes bankrupt.

79
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,000
That place is cursed.

80
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,000
I just bought it.

81
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:35,900
- Congratulations!
- Awesome!

82
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,000
- That's amazing!
- Yay!

83
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,200
Yeah, I'm reopening it
as a tapas bar.

84
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,700
What's it called?

85
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,300
Get on Tapas.

86
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,100
Get on Tapas. Get it?
A tapas bar.

87
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,400
Are you Spanish?

88
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,200
No.

89
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,300
Why are you opening
a tapas place?

90
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,300
Well, I saw this graph of recent
graduates from my law school...

91
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,300
and statistically, I was right
where it said I should be.

92
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,500
Felt a little cookie-cuttered, had
a one-third life crisis. Quit the firm.

93
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,700
- That's nuts.
- Anyway...

94
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,100
I'm here to get some flowers
for my girlfriend.

95
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,500
Your girlfriend.

96
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:19,800
Excellent.

97
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,800
- Very romantic.
- What's over here?

98
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,800
Good, good.
Because...

99
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,800
I'll be honest, I'm kind of
on shaky ground with this one.

100
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,900
I grew up in Atlanta
and down there...

101
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,600
if a date turned into the morning after
that's your girlfriend now.

102
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,800
But I don't know
if this is my girlfriend...

103
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,800
or if it's just somebody
I'm dating.

104
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,300
- Well, how long has it been?
- Two months.

105
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,600
Sounds like a girlfriend to me.

106
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,600
Okay.
So I'll take these.

107
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,900
These are for friendship.

108
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,500
Now for Valentine's Day...

109
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,200
these are for girlfriends.

110
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,200
I did not know that.

111
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,700
So, do you know
if she's home right now?

112
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:12,400
No. She's a flight attendant and
she's out of town. She travels a lot.

113
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,500
You know what would be romantic?
You get the landlord to let you in...

114
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:20,500
and then you leave these
beside her bedside.

115
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,900
That's a great idea.

116
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,700
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

117
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,200
Happy Valentine's Day.

118
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,400
Happy Valentine's Day.

119
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,700
- Why'd you say that, Genevieve?
- What?

120
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,200
- That poor guy.
- That old line. She's not "traveling".

121
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,500
She's got three boyfriends.

122
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,700
<i>Guys like that
never see it coming.</i>

123
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,700
<i>- How'd you get in?
- Boy.</i>

124
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,100
<i>He's the type of guy who doesn't know
he's good-looking...</i>

125
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,800
<i>and goes and gives a woman his heart
and he gets stomped on.</i>

126
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,600
<i>Over and over and over again.</i>

127
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,700
<i>No Dijon! You'll take
American mustard and like it.</i>

128
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,300
- Okay.
- That's dumb. Soap can't get dirty.

129
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,900
- Lf mud fell on it.
- It would wash right off.

130
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,400
Wouldn't the mud be
declared clean on impact?

131
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,800
Right, it's soap!
The word means clean.

132
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,200
What, like, in Latin?

133
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,700
Thanks, Mom,
but that's Valentine's Day.

134
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,800
<i>Can you make beef stroganoff
with chicken?</i>

135
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:42,300
Yes. You can definitely
substitute chicken.

136
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,600
<i>- With Egg Beaters?
- Or Egg Beaters.</i>

137
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,800
<i>- It'll be too sticky.
- Okay, I gotta go.</i>

138
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,600
Yeah, bye. Yeah, bye.

139
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,300
<i>- Yeah, bye.
- Bye- bye.</i>

140
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,900
Hey, get your meat paws
off my food.

141
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,500
All right, everyone.

142
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,400
What are the plans for
Valentine's Day?

143
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,300
It's too much pressure.

144
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,900
My skull is gonna cave in.

145
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,100
All right, it's the celebration
of romance.

146
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,800
Not if you've been single
since pubes.

147
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,700
Kathy, what about the guy
you see on the bus every day?

148
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,800
I'm taking your advice,
I'm waiting to be wooed.

149
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,500
- Good.
- Although I did accidentally...

150
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,800
kick his seat.

151
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,200
Very nice.
Dan?

152
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:25,700
I bought a girl at work
some chocolates.

153
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,700
That's really sweet.

154
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,500
- Yeah?
- Yes.

155
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,100
Very good.
Brian?

156
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,900
I think I'm gonna bake the girl
at the newsstand a cake.

157
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,200
It's not funny.

158
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,900
- That's nice.
- Yeah?

159
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,400
- Yeah.
- Hey, hey, hey, sorry I'm late!

160
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,600
- Hi.
- Hi.

161
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,500
Sorry, y'all, I was late.
I know.

162
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,000
Java Joint guy asked me out.

163
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,800
- You already went there?
- Yup.

164
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,900
Have you Googled him?

165
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,900
He was a total chubster
in middle school...

166
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,500
but then he played football
in high school and he lost the weight.

167
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:03,100
And his mom's a teacher
and his dad sells used cars.

168
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:06,100
I went back and I told him
his best friend's name in high school...

169
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,800
and that it would be a perfect name
for our first child.

170
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,400
- Weird?
- Lf weird means spooky.

171
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,500
Hey, you have to wait
to be wooed.

172
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,600
Anyway, we have a date tonight.

173
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,000
I really don't wanna
mess this one up.

174
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,200
Then don't text him eighty-two times
between now and then.

175
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,100
Yes. Wait to be wooed.

176
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,800
And then you have five dates.
And that's all.

177
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:33,900
Okay.

178
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,100
Just tell me what to do
one more time.

179
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:40,000
All right. Date One:
Breathless flirting.

180
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,800
Date Two:
Tummy flip flops.

181
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,800
Date Three:
The adventurous date.

182
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,400
Date Four:
Be fun and fabulous.

183
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,900
- I'm always fun and fabulous.
- Date Five...

184
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:55,300
make it the best date ever.
And then you say good-bye.

185
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,700
When the romance is gone,
it's time to move on.

186
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,200
He'll only remember you
with sweet soft memories.

187
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,800
And you?
You will never be hurt again.

188
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,200
Okay.
I'm totally doing it your way.

189
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,200
- And keep those knees together.
- Dang.

190
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,100
- Happy Valentine's Day!
- Thank you!

191
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,000
Happy Valentine's Day!
Happy Valentine's Day!

192
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,700
Hi, happy Valentine's Day.
Happy Valentine's Day!

193
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,700
Hi, guys,
happy Valentine's Day.

194
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,400
- Hi, happy Valentine's Day!
- Thanks.

195
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,000
Happy Valentine's Day!
Happy Valentine's Day!

196
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,300
- Happy Valentine's Day!
- Help!

197
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,000
Welcome back.

198
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,100
This sucks.

199
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,600
Let's go in.

200
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,300
I can't see you.

201
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,400
Hiya, Greg.

202
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,400
Happy V-Day, buddy.

203
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,300
Wow, look at this place.

204
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,100
Big mistake.

205
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,500
Where are you taking her tonight?

206
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,100
What's with that?

207
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,900
For setting me up
with a flight attendant.

208
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,700
Yeah, let's go meet
some flight attendants.

209
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:23,500
- I just got dumped by one.
- One what?

210
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,900
A flight attendant.
The one you set me up with.

211
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,200
How'd that go?

212
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,300
- Do you ever listen?
- Well, then I'd have to hear you, buddy.

213
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,900
She said my actions let her know
that we weren't exclusive.

214
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,900
I thought we were exclusive.

215
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,100
So?

216
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,900
So it's my fault once again,
for not understanding The Game.

217
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,800
No, there's no game tonight.

218
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,000
<i>Well, I don't think long-term
relationships work.</i>

219
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,800
- I haven't had a relationship in a year.
- Really?

220
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,600
- Yeah.
- Here, enjoy.

221
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,300
And you seem like a fun guy.

222
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,900
I'm sorry. Pardon,
I just wanna take this. It's my friend.

223
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,400
She keeps calling
and I'm a bit worried about her.

224
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,100
I'll be right with you.

225
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,900
<i>Hi, Tammy. Are you okay?
Aren't you on a date?</i>

226
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,400
<i>- Hello?
- God.</i>

227
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:17,100
I downloaded Coffee Guy's
yearbook photos...

228
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,900
and I made him a scrapbook.

229
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,800
<i>And he blanched...</i>

230
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,400
and ran out.

231
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,000
I'm so sorry.

232
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,100
You're watching
"Jerry Maguire" again.

233
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,400
<i>- No.
- Listen to me.</i>

234
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,400
Nobody completes anybody!

235
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,500
<i>Tammy, you're the best.
I'll call you when I get home.</i>

236
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,300
<i>- Turn off the TV!
- Okay.</i>

237
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,900
Hi.

238
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:49,000
So, wait, wait. Let's... let's go back
to what you were talking about.

239
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,800
You don't want a relationship?

240
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,600
Yes, I do not want a relationship.

241
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,800
They're just an emotional cage...

242
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,100
that sad couples peek
from behind the bars of...

243
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,800
Iooking at all us
happy single people...

244
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,900
wondering what fear of being alone
made them say "I do".

245
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,200
So, you're some kind of swinger?

246
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
What just happened?

247
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,800
- Oops.
- Uh-oh.

248
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,000
Okay.

249
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,300
I can just imagine
the tapas on that.

250
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,800
- Hi.
- Hi.

251
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,000
It looks great in here.

252
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,200
Well, thanks.

253
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:52,800
So...

254
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,200
- you're opening soon.
- No.

255
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,700
Yes, I guess.

256
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,100
I was thinking, I would like to provide
your floral arrangements.

257
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,700
Well...

258
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,200
I didn't put flowers in my budget.

259
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,900
I'm sorry. I thought you just said
you didn't put flowers into your budget.

260
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,000
- I did.
- Take it back.

261
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,400
What?

262
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,800
Greg, with all due respect...

263
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,400
you're making a huge mistake.

264
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,600
A new restaurant is not
just about the food.

265
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
It's about ambiance
and soul.

266
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:31,200
Now, flowers provide a salve
to our senses...

267
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,400
because aesthetic beauty calms us
and soothes us.

268
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:38,500
Which means, customers
will feel good here.

269
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,700
They will linger,
they'll order more wine...

270
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,900
which means they'll have dessert
and they will leave happy.

271
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,300
And they will go home
and they're gonna make love.

272
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,500
They will wake up in a great mood
and then tell everybody...

273
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:54,700
about the fabulous new tapas restaurant
they just went to.

274
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,500
Flowers do all that?

275
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,600
Yes.

276
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,400
How much?

277
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,100
Not much.

278
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,400
You're good.

279
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,100
Who told you?

280
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,400
<i>- Mom call-waiting. I should go.
- I should tile my patio.</i>

281
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,300
<i>On "Martha Stewart,"
she did it on her own.</i>

282
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,400
<i>She even fired her own tiles
in a homemade kiln.</i>

283
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,100
<i>I'll bet she can glaze a ham
with her feet.</i>

284
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,900
<i>Okay, why did I call?
Let me see, now I can't remember.</i>

285
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,500
<i>Yes, yes, yes.</i>

286
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:42,400
<i>What was the name of the man
who had the dog that looked like a cat?</i>

287
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,500
Okay...

288
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:44,900
<i>He died.</i>

289
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,000
I'm sorry.
All right, I'll send some flowers.

290
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,900
<i>- Okay.
- Okay. Yeah, bye.</i>

291
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,500
<i>- Yeah, bye. Yeah, bye.
- Bye- bye.</i>

292
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,400
<i>One new message.</i>

293
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,300
<i>Hi, Genevieve.
It's me, your dad.</i>

294
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:05,000
<i>Just calling to say hi
and see what you're up to.</i>

295
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,500
<i>Give me a call some time.</i>

296
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,600
Then why is it called a lawn mower
and not just a mower...

297
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,800
since you don't mow anything
but a lawn?

298
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,800
You could get mowed down
by a car.

299
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,600
- Yeah, but not with a lawn mower. See?
- Yes, you could.

300
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,600
If it was running on your lawn and you
bent over, it could run right over you.

301
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,400
- Why would you do that?
- Hey, Dan.

302
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,600
You got a really fat head.

303
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,000
- Maybe it's your face.
- Yeah, it's hereditary.

304
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,800
My mom has a fat face
and my dad has a fat head.

305
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,300
You should see his mom's head.
It's huge.

306
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,100
Can I help you?

307
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:48,600
Hi. I'm Greg Gatlin. I own
the new restaurant down the street.

308
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,500
Good.
I missed the pizza.

309
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,900
Well, now it's a tapas bar
called Get on Tapas.

310
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,400
I don't get it.

311
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,300
Tapas bar.

312
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,300
I don't get it.

313
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,500
Tapas bar.

314
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:16,100
Anyway, I'm having a party
in a couple weeks. Hope you can come.

315
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,900
- I don't go to parties.
- Yeah, I don't think so.

316
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,800
- Free food and drinks.
- Why didn't you said so?

317
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,100
- Welcome to the neighborhood.
- Thank you.

318
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:27,400
- Yeah, good luck with the restaurant.
- You know that place is cursed, right?

319
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,800
I'm gonna beat that curse...

320
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,400
but I'll need you to
Get on Tapas.

321
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,200
It's a florist's secret that the
purple ones have the deepest scent.

322
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,700
For the party, I'm gonna put one
on a hair comb for your girlfriend.

323
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,400
No girlfriend.

324
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,100
I'm sorry.

325
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,900
- She wasn't who I thought she was.
- Okay, well...

326
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,500
owner of this new hot
Brooklyn restaurant...

327
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,300
you are gonna meet
somebody new.

328
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,500
No, no, no.
I'm off relationships.

329
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,400
Fantastic.
You'll be so much happier.

330
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:20,900
Okay, you're not gonna say
that thing that women always say...

331
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,800
which is I haven't found
the right one yet?

332
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,800
No. I don't believe
there's just one person.

333
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,200
What?

334
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,600
I don't believe people are meant
to be in relationships.

335
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,500
- What?
- Yeah, we should just have fun.

336
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:36,200
And when the romance is gone,
move on.

337
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:40,700
- Well, how long does that last?
- Five dates to be exact.

338
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,500
That is exact.

339
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,600
Five dates happens to be the perfect
amount of time...

340
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,000
to achieve maximum fun
with no pain.

341
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,600
No expectation equals
no disappointment.

342
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,500
It's just fun,
and there are no rules.

343
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,200
- No rules?
- No rules.

344
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,700
And you know what? In relationships,
that's all there are.

345
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,800
You know, one person wants more,
the other person wants less.

346
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,500
And then they act out cheat,
come back, stay out of guilt...

347
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,300
oops, now someone's pregnant,
all of a sudden...

348
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,800
you're married
and hate each other.

349
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,400
Dating is just
so much more romantic.

350
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,600
So, you love romance
but not relationships?

351
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,500
What's to love about something
that only brings unhappiness?

352
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,500
It's just...
It's just not natural.

353
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,700
Do you know any happy couples?

354
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,800
All the time?
No, but...

355
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,600
I am happy all the time.

356
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,000
That's hot.
Is she hot?

357
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,800
Doesn't matter.
Her attitude is hot.

358
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,700
She could have three eyes,
two butts and a tooth and I'd do her.

359
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,400
Hey, does this tie say
"My client's guilty"?

360
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,500
She's just...

361
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,400
Hey, when was the last time
you had a good pastrami sandwich?

362
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:52,800
New cafeteria girl has a sexy
thin eyebrows thing going on.

363
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,000
All right, I'm gonna ask her out.

364
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,600
You lucky moron, she just wants
to have sex with you.

365
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,900
What?
Don't be ridiculous.

366
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,800
Dude, trust me.
Chicks love an assertive guy.

367
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,600
Come on, try it for once.

368
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,400
I wanna have sex with you.

369
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:27,600
Greg...

370
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,300
just because I don't believe
in relationships...

371
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,000
does not mean that I'm easy.

372
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:36,000
If you are interested in spending
some time with me, you may romance me.

373
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,000
Got it?

374
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,400
Okay.

375
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:41,800
Sorry.

376
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,700
It's okay.

377
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,600
Now... it just so happens,
I am open for wooing.

378
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,900
Okay. What do I do?

379
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,500
Well, anything.

380
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,500
Women appreciate any gesture
of romance.

381
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,600
I'm not a romantic.

382
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,400
You broke into your ex's apartment
with roses.

383
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,600
I caught her in bed.

384
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,400
You did?

385
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,800
That was my fault.
I'm sorry.

386
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,400
- Back to this.
- Okay.

387
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,100
Just put some effort into it.

388
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,700
Women like to be pursued.

389
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:23,900
I've been flown to Hawaii,
I've had my name peed in the snow.

390
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:26,900
It all counts.

391
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,000
Okay.

392
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:35,100
How about rent a billboard
that says, "Let's bone"?

393
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,000
Or "You got nice hair".

394
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,500
Look, I am intrigued by
this theory of hers.

395
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,700
My instincts are messed up and...

396
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:46,800
stat-wise my dump ratio
is off the charts lately.

397
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,100
Lately?
No, you've always gotten burned.

398
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,700
Remember in law school that chick
who dumped you by fax?

399
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,500
Or the one who ditched you
for a party clown?

400
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:59,200
- That's why I hate clowns.
- I like balloon animals.

401
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,800
Especially giraffes.

402
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,300
Hey, but with this chick,
you can't get dumped.

403
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,600
You're so right.
That's the beauty of it.

404
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,700
We're both agreeing to end it
after five dates.

405
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I think I'm gonna try this...

406
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,700
see if I can come out without
the usual intestine-twisting pain.

407
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,600
What, am I boring you?
I sound like I'm on Oprah's couch?

408
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,600
Man, Oprah is hot.

409
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,000
- Oops.
- Uh-oh.

410
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,000
Here you go.

411
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,700
Hello.

412
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,900
- Hi.
- Hey.

413
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,700
Don't you guys have something
to do in the back?

414
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:03,800
No.

415
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:09,400
Could you take these to that place
that ordered them that day...

416
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,800
when they called on the phone
to ask about them?

417
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,400
Thank you.

418
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,600
I have not asked you out.

419
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,700
But I'm working on it.

420
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:40,200
I'm just stumped by
the whole romance thing...

421
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,600
the gesture to woo you with.

422
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,600
Jewelry, a stuffed animal.

423
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,200
I mean, I just, you know, a bird?

424
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,200
I don't know what
I'm supposed to do.

425
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:56,600
Well, you're not
"supposed" to do...

426
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,200
anything.

427
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,100
You know what, forget it.
It's okay.

428
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:08,100
Obviously this is just causing you
stress and... Let's be friends.

429
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,100
Hey, what's that?

430
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,600
- No, no, hey...
- Hey, wait a minute. No, don't.

431
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,900
It's got my name on it!
Let me see.

432
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,500
"Roses are red, violets are blue.

433
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:38,100
Will you be my date for my restaurant
opening? I hope you do."

434
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,500
There you go!

435
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,000
- To Get on Tapas!
- To Get on Tapas!

436
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,200
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

437
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,000
I can't believe I did it.

438
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,100
I'm really glad you're here.

439
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,500
To our first date.

440
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,100
- Is this an okay first date?
- Yes, it's perfect.

441
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,300
Okay.

442
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,900
Because Date Number One
is a new beginning.

443
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,700
Well, this place is going to take up
a lot of my time, so...

444
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,700
I'll have to take it slow with us.
Is there a time frame?

445
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,400
No.

446
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Okay.

447
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:25,200
What a dump! I'm just joking.
Nice place. When you closing?

448
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,700
Best burrito bar I've ever seen.

449
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Cal, this is Genevieve...

450
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,400
- the girl I told you about.
- When?

451
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:35,800
Five dates.

452
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:39,900
Hello.
I'm Cal, short for Callous.

453
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,300
On behalf of men everywhere,
I would just like to say thank you.

454
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:48,700
You should teach a course to all
the crazy, clingy broads that I've...

455
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,500
hey, this is ping.

456
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,400
Is this your adopted daughter?

457
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,500
She's my date.

458
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,100
Good, someone's choking.

459
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:05,800
Behave.

460
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:08,300
Dude, is there a club of them?
Are there others here?

461
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,500
Get ping a drink.

462
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,200
There you go.

463
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,400
Sorry about Cal.

464
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:24,300
- He's harmless.
- Yeah. If you're vaccinated.

465
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,200
Hey, I...

466
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,500
I saw this and thought of you.

467
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,500
I love it!

468
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,400
Yeah, Spanish flowers.

469
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,200
It's really thoughtful.
Thank you.

470
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:45,000
God! For a while there,
it was gonna be a scented candle.

471
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,100
That would have been nice, too.

472
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,800
What about... notepaper?

473
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,700
- Lovely.
- Scarf?

474
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,800
- Yes.
- Antique stool?

475
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,000
- Creepy.
- Really?

476
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,200
Yeah.

477
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,500
I'm not really a fan
of antiques.

478
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,400
You know, they...

479
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:07,800
I can kind of only see the person
who once had it, you know...

480
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,400
like their, their dead hand
clutching it.

481
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:11,900
You know?

482
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,600
Good to know.

483
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,000
Other stuff: Jazz makes me nervous
and nauseas...

484
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,700
and one sleeve dresses,
they're just wrong.

485
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:23,300
I'm hot,
no this arm's cold.

486
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,900
Got it.

487
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,100
Okay.

488
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,500
And what are your fears?

489
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,400
Opening a restaurant.

490
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,700
How are reservations?

491
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:42,300
A few people have called.
For pizza.

492
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,800
You smell nice.

493
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,600
This is the good part.

494
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,400
What?

495
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,700
The anticipation.

496
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,400
<i>So thanks for taking
the day off work.</i>

497
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,600
<i>An art gallery opening,
what a great idea!</i>

498
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,700
Yeah? Good, good, because you said
our second date should be...

499
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:21,900
theatrical or cultural,
so I thought of this, or...

500
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,600
maybe a concert.

501
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,900
Okay, I don't know what you're thinking
to do about for music...

502
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,400
for your restaurant, but I saw this band
at a wedding I did last year...

503
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,500
and they can play anything.

504
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,900
That's, that's so thoughtful of you.

505
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,000
"Exhalations".

506
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,700
It's called "Manifest Destiny.

507
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,700
It's called "Train Tracks".

508
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,100
Isn't it beautiful?

509
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,400
Two thousand dollars.

510
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:39,300
What?
Let me see that.

511
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,600
This one's called
"I Hate Grandma".

512
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,300
For real?

513
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,400
No.

514
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,300
What's it called?

515
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,600
"Yellow dot".

516
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,400
I don't see it.

517
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,100
I'm so glad you didn't like it.

518
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:33,300
I'm so glad you didn't like it,
either.

519
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,100
Now, on Date Number Two...

520
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:40,800
we do the requisite trading
of familial background information.

521
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,400
A sister, two parents, all close.

522
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:47,700
Okay, no siblings, parents divorced,
not close to my father.

523
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,100
Why not?

524
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,200
- My dad cheated.
- That must've been hard.

525
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,700
Well, I plan to get over it one day.

526
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,700
Yeah, yeah, it's good to let that
seething anger fester for a long time.

527
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:06,500
Well, changing the subject,
you owe me something private back.

528
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,900
Jeez.
One time, I heard my parents.

529
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,800
- No, no.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

530
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,600
Couldn't look them in the eye
until I was in college.

531
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,200
"Hey, Mom, Dad."

532
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,600
Weird.

533
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,900
- This is a fun date.
- You like my system, huh?

534
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:32,100
Yeah, so far so good.
I mean, no expectations...

535
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:36,600
or wondering if the other person
is looking for some kind of commitment.

536
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,500
- No worrying about the first kiss.
- Yeah, that's over.

537
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,200
I'm...

538
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:58,500
I'm not really good with the public
display of affection kind of thing.

539
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,400
Okay. Okay.

540
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,200
Go, go, go back to the part
about the kissing.

541
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,300
Yeah, the part about the kissing.

542
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,800
- Wait, when's the next date?
- Yeah, when's the next date?

543
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
In eight days.

544
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,900
I told him Date Number Three
should be an adventure.

545
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:38,600
- I can't wait.
- I can't wait.

546
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,600
Cal recommended this place.

547
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,000
Okay, this sake is called Nigori
and it's very unique.

548
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:54,400
Later we're gonna try Junmai,
which is very pure.

549
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:55,500
Okay.

550
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,300
But here's the adventure...
a sake bomb!

551
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,100
Okay.

552
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,400
All right!

553
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,800
It's time for Kamikaze Karaoke!

554
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:14,500
Where I put the songs,
nobody knows!

555
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,400
All right, our first...

556
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:20,100
player is...

557
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,900
seat number six.

558
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:26,800
Look under your chair
for your number.

559
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,300
Seat six.

560
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,900
- That's me!
- Come on down! Come on!

561
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,600
Come on, hurry up!

562
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:38,500
That's my number!
What's my song?

563
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:42,000
You are singing
"polly Wolly Doodle".

564
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:45,500
- I don't know the words.
- That's why it's...

565
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:48,200
Kamikaze Karaoke!

566
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,000
Did you know about this?

567
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,000
No.

568
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,400
<i>I went down south</i>

569
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,800
<i>For to see my Sal Sing
Polly Wolly Doodle all the day</i>

570
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,100
That was great, that was great!

571
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,800
Despite what everyone thinks,
that was fantastic.

572
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,800
<i>Nobody knows</i>

573
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:16,600
<i>The trouble I have seen</i>

574
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,700
<i>Glory</i>

575
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:22,200
<i>Hallelujah</i>

576
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,400
All right, that was wonderful.

577
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:29,300
I don't know what song that was,
but that was fantastic.

578
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,100
Go head, have a seat.
Sorry, your time onstage is done.

579
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,700
Thank you very much, sir.

580
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Okay.
Next up seat number...

581
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,600
thirty-three.
Thirty-three?

582
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,800
Thirty-three?
Come on, don't be shy!

583
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,100
Thirty-three!

584
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:52,300
- Thirty-three!
- Thirty-three!

585
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:53,700
Genevieve.

586
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:57,600
- Thirty-three!
- Thirty-three!

587
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Then go!

588
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,500
No way.

589
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,300
Go!

590
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:07,800
- Thirty-three!
- Thirty-three!

591
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,200
That's me!

592
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,300
All right!

593
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,700
All right, there you go.

594
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,200
Hi. Okay, you have...

595
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,600
"There's No Livin'
Without Your Lovin"'.

596
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,500
- Okay.
- All right.

597
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:25,700
Thank you.

598
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:31,200
<i>If I can't love you</i>

599
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:34,700
<i>Till the day I die</i>

600
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,400
<i>Then baby, oh baby</i>

601
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,000
<i>What good am I?</i>

602
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:45,500
<i>If I can't reach out
And know that you'll be there</i>

603
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:50,200
<i>Then this old world
Ain't spinning anywhere</i>

604
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:55,100
<i>And there's no livin'
Without your loving</i>

605
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,800
And the fellow!

606
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,300
You can do it!

607
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:01,900
Something!

608
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,200
Come on!

609
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:14,000
You suck!
You suck!

610
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:18,900
You suck!
You suck!

611
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:20,500
Enough abuse for you.

612
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,000
Come on down there, missy.
That was fantastic.

613
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,100
All right.
Big round of applause.

614
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,500
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

615
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,400
- Should we go?
- No.

616
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:35,200
No, I could never get up there.
It's too public.

617
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,900
But that's what's fun
about karaoke.

618
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,300
I couldn't get up there.

619
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:44,600
- So you do have a fear.
- No. No fear, just a choice.

620
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,100
A choice not to act like an idiot
and do something stupid.

621
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:53,200
<i>Buffalo gals, can you come out tonight
Can you come out tonight</i>

622
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:56,300
I don't know, I think sometimes
it's fun to do something stupid.

623
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,400
That's 'cause you're fun.

624
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:01,700
You're easygoing and nothing fazes you
and there's no pretense.

625
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
You're blushing.

626
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,700
I am?

627
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,300
Yeah.

628
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,200
Should we order?

629
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:19,300
Yeah. See if they have
public humiliation on the menu.

630
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:22,300
They do.
I just had it as an appetizer.

631
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,400
<i>I think it's interesting.</i>

632
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,900
These southern gentlemen,
they're not loud and show-offy like us.

633
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:37,100
You know, he's a gentleman.
He doesn't do stupid things.

634
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,300
He's different.

635
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,600
I don't know,
she's just so alive, so...

636
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,500
fearless.

637
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:48,300
- And the best part? No rules.
- Yeah, well, that's different.

638
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,700
- She is different.
- Who?

639
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,200
Dinner.

640
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,200
Why are we friends?

641
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,100
Hello, canoe tip?
I saved your life at summer camp.

642
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,500
No, no, no.
I saved your life, pal.

643
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,900
And I've been loyal to you
ever since.

644
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,300
- Here comes Genevieve.
- Who's that?

645
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:11,000
I gotta get to court.
Thanks for the nachos.

646
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:12,800
Hello.

647
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,200
- Hi.
- So I was thinking...

648
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:19,100
why not get a stellar review and
make your place the talk of the town?

649
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,800
- It's that easy?
- Yeah.

650
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,700
Well, I'm not ready.

651
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,800
The menu is still in transition.

652
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,300
- It's just a little neighborhood joint.
- Really? Well, I thought you'd say that.

653
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:35,100
So I told him what a nice,
hardworking guy you are...

654
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,100
and that opening a restaurant
is this huge big change in your life...

655
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,200
and he said when you're ready for
a review, you just call the paper, okay?

656
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:46,300
- You called the critic?
- Yeah.

657
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,200
Thank you.

658
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:52,900
You're welcome.

659
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,500
Well, I should go.

660
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,300
Okay.

661
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:22,700
Happy.

662
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:25,600
You think so?
I'd say unhappy.

663
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,700
What looks unhappy about him?

664
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:30,800
Stooped shoulders, big sigher.
Watch.

665
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,700
Wait for it.

666
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,400
- You're good.
- I have a gift.

667
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,900
- Yeah, all right.
- Watch.

668
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,600
Pretty upbeat guy.

669
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:48,600
- Worried about office politics.
- Is that right?

670
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,800
Pretty upbeat gal.

671
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,000
Worried about...

672
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:59,400
- nothing?
- I told you, happy all the time.

673
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:04,900
Or just doesn't think about things
that make her unhappy.

674
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,000
Look at that old lady.

675
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,400
- Happy.
- Yeah.

676
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:32,000
- Hey, Tim, can I ask you a question?
- Keep it clean.

677
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,800
Genevieve's really not
into commitment?

678
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,800
No.
No, just fun.

679
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,800
What do you think about
this five dates theory?

680
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:47,200
I got a wife, two kids,
two mortgages, nosy in-laws...

681
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:51,200
a dog that humps my La-Z-Boy,
and no peace.

682
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,200
I think she's a genius.

683
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,400
She makes me feel like...

684
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:59,200
it's hard to explain,
but like I can do no wrong.

685
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,700
I'm planning dates,
I'm buying little gifts.

686
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:03,600
That's not me, but I like it.

687
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:06,500
So I wanna do something
really special for her.

688
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,000
What do you have in mind?

689
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,100
From Greg.

690
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:46,200
"In my fantasy, you're wearing
these with nothing but a smile."

691
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,400
My!

692
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,300
- Let me see.
- Gimme! Gimme!

693
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:50,800
No!

694
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,800
<i>I don't think so!</i>

695
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,500
<i>It's mine.</i>

696
00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:00,700
I'll be honest. I don't know
if I can beat that restaurant's curse.

697
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:03,800
You will.

698
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,200
This is pretty.

699
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:14,600
Antique.

700
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,700
Thanks for making dinner.

701
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:28,300
You said it would make
a great fourth date.

702
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:30,100
Thanks for listening.

703
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,800
To our fourth date
in three months.

704
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:38,900
Yeah.

705
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,000
You know, for me...

706
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:48,700
romances are usually
this fast whirlwind...

707
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:50,100
and I...

708
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,600
I've just really enjoyed taking
the time to get to know you.

709
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:00,200
Yeah, me too.

710
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:08,600
- So what's this now?
- Marinated peppers.

711
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:10,000
That's hot.

712
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:15,500
How hot?

713
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:06,200
This is the most fun
I've ever had.

714
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:12,700
Me too.

715
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:27,000
Great. Now I gotta get one of these
for my wife for Mother's Day.

716
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:30,200
Good morning, beautiful boys!

717
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,600
Your skin is very clear.

718
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:36,100
Your eyes are so white.

719
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,100
They did it!
They did it!

720
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:42,500
They did it!
They did it! They did it!

721
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,700
Hey, this is none
of your business.

722
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:51,500
- But we're so proud of you!
- Deets. I need details.

723
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:55,500
I would never. I'm a lady.
Please!

724
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:57,800
Okay.

725
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:00,300
Then we won't ask you about it.

726
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,300
- Good.
- Fine.

727
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,300
Super fine.

728
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:10,700
I have mail to open.

729
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:14,300
Tim, orchids
for the Mother's Day rush?

730
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:15,500
Friday.

731
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:18,700
How are my eyebrows?

732
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:22,100
Very Gwen Stefani
during pregnancy.

733
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:28,500
- He cooked for me.
- Go on, go on.

734
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:31,500
- I slept over for two nights.
- Go on!

735
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:34,600
- So this is date number four?
- Yeah.

736
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,700
- And there's one more date after this?
- Yes.

737
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:38,700
And after date number five,
it's over?

738
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:42,200
Yes.

739
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,000
You seem different.

740
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,800
- How?
- I don't know.

741
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:07,700
Hi.

742
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,400
What are we doing?

743
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:12,900
Can you see Greg?

744
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:18,100
- Yeah.
- Okay.

745
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:21,500
Does he look sick
or injured or on fire?

746
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:27,200
No.

747
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:30,700
It's been four days?

748
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:32,200
Yeah.

749
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:35,200
Four days.

750
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:39,800
- Why hasn't he called me?
- He'll call.

751
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:42,500
So look.
It's crazy.

752
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:45,100
Looks like a reborn...

753
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:46,500
- Hey.
- Hello.

754
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:51,300
What'll it be today, Genevieve?
Pears and Brie?

755
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,400
Pate and celery sticks?

756
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:56,300
I'll have a meatball sandwich.

757
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,500
He hasn't called yet, huh?

758
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:10,400
How are you?

759
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:13,000
Good.

760
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:14,600
Good.

761
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:19,200
How are you?

762
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:21,000
Good.

763
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:22,800
Good.

764
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,100
How are you?

765
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:28,900
- Good.
- Good.

766
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:30,700
- Good.
- Good.

767
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:33,300
How are you?

768
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:35,500
Good.

769
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:38,800
Good, good.

770
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,900
That's on the house.

771
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:53,000
Genevieve. To go.

772
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:09,700
- What's going on?
- Pardon?

773
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:12,000
- You didn't call.
- What do you mean?

774
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,700
What do you think,
you can just have your way with me?

775
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:16,900
- But you said...
- What? What did I say?

776
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:20,500
Five dates. Then move on.
No anger, no recriminations...

777
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,400
- no commitments.
- Right. We had four dates.

778
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:25,300
Four?
No, five.

779
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,000
What are you talking about?

780
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:30,900
Restaurant opening, Date One.
Art gallery, Two.

781
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:34,100
Karaoke, Date Three.
Dinner at my place, Date Four.

782
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:36,400
Then, you stayed over that night
and the next...

783
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:40,300
so I thought that whole next day
and night was the five dates.

784
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:46,100
Yeah, I'm just kidding.

785
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:50,000
You are?

786
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,000
I'm joking.

787
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:55,200
Yeah, that makes five dates.

788
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:59,500
- It was a lovely love affair.
- Yeah, it was great. I'd like to...

789
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:01,900
But the romance is gone,
so we must move on.

790
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:03,400
- I know, but do we have to move on...
- Yes.

791
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:06,900
Anymore dates would be a relationship
and those do not work.

792
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:09,000
- I wanna...
- Okay. All right, see you.

793
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:11,400
My God, my sandwich.
So hungry. Bye.

794
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:18,600
When? When?
When is she coming back?

795
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,200
Don't you work?

796
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:21,800
Yes.

797
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:25,700
Hi. Thanks for coming in.

798
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:28,100
I heard.

799
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:29,900
What happened?

800
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,200
He thought we had five dates.

801
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:35,700
Why on earth would he think
a sleepover equals another date?

802
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:38,500
Maybe because it sort of does.

803
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:40,500
Can you be quiet?

804
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:43,700
But maybe it does
a little bit for boys, maybe?

805
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:50,000
- Do you want another date?
- No.

806
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:52,900
- But maybe you do.
- No.

807
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:55,400
Yes. Maybe this could be
a relationship, maybe?

808
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:56,900
No!

809
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,100
Fine.

810
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,800
And let's just be clear, okay?

811
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:08,500
It was four dates.

812
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:10,900
Five.

813
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:12,600
Bye.

814
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:14,800
Gotta go.

815
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:23,300
- What's this place called?
- Get on Tapas.

816
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:25,900
That's dirty!

817
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:34,400
Stupid, stupid, stupid.

818
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:35,900
What'd I do?

819
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:39,300
I'm so sorry!

820
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:41,500
I'm so sorry!
I'm so sorry!

821
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,700
I'm so sorry!
I'm sorry!

822
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:52,100
Yeah, no, no, no.

823
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:54,600
I gotta...
Really, I gotta...

824
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:57,400
- Really? Come on. Really?
- I think I'm catching something.

825
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:59,100
You better watch it
or you will, too.

826
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:02,500
Right. Hey, what happened to that one
you were "not dating?"

827
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:05,700
- Five dates. It's over.
- Atta boy!

828
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:09,200
- Yeah. Have fun, man.
- Let's roll. Who's first?

829
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:16,700
Make that booty call.

830
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:20,100
- It's complicated.
- No, honey. My bowels are complicated.

831
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,600
Life is simple.
Call her.

832
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:29,400
<i>If you knew a certain gesture,
like, say, calling...</i>

833
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:33,300
would be considered "needy",
and therefore a turnoff...

834
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:36,500
but you wanted to call,
and you felt...

835
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,100
this call could be welcomed
this one time...

836
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:44,200
if you were the one person who took
a chance to do something different...

837
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:49,100
maybe even some
would call it romantic...

838
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:52,600
like calling for another date...

839
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,200
a date that...

840
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:58,000
if someone were counting,
could be numbered above five...

841
00:53:58,200 --> 00:53:59,600
say six...

842
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:04,000
do you think that
would be considered manly?

843
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:07,300
No, it wouldn't.
It would be a pain in the ass.

844
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:12,500
Thank you.

845
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:15,900
One new message.

846
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:19,700
<i>Hi, it's me, your dad.</i>

847
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:23,000
<i>Well, I guess I missed you again.</i>

848
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:27,600
<i>Maybe I have an old number
for you? Did I say it's me?</i>

849
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:31,100
<i>Gimme a call sometime.</i>

850
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:46,600
Happy birthday!

851
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Hi, Mom.

852
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:54,600
This is delicious.

853
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:56,900
I made it from a "Top Chef' recipe.

854
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:00,300
It's called "Gateau". Now wouldn't you
think that's made from a cat's toe?

855
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:03,300
But it's G, "gateau".

856
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,800
It means cake in French.

857
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:08,300
Genevieve?

858
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:12,300
Your father said
you never call him.

859
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:16,900
You talk to Dad?

860
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,600
Of course! He was my life
for twenty-five years.

861
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,500
Not the photo.
Okay.

862
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:29,200
He had affairs.

863
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:49,200
So, are you seeing anybody now,
Missus Gernier?

864
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,300
- Please say you are.
- Yeah.

865
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:53,400
Okay.

866
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,400
I wouldn't know a thing
about dating.

867
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:58,600
Ask Genevieve.
She's an expert on dating.

868
00:55:58,600 --> 00:55:59,500
Yeah.

869
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,100
Okay.

870
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:04,900
Hey, hey, wow,
we have to get to work.

871
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:06,400
So, okay.

872
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:10,000
Well, hey, you guys owe me forty bucks
for these cameras.

873
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,700
- You gave it to me.
- No, I didn't. I said I'd...

874
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:13,800
- Yeah, you did.
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean for that to...

875
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:17,500
Thanks for coming by.
Mom, thanks for the cake.

876
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:19,700
- Come on!
- Happy birthday, dear.

877
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:33,000
Oops.

878
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:34,500
Uh-oh.

879
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:43,900
So now the restaurant
is a success?

880
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:48,200
I told him about that reviewer,
and the band.

881
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:50,100
Do you want to go inside?

882
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:51,500
No!

883
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:53,800
You could flirt with the band
in front of Greg.

884
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:54,800
Okay.

885
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:57,700
Do I have anything in my teeth?

886
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:01,300
- No, you are okay.
- Really?

887
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:02,200
Yeah.

888
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:04,500
What about here?
Is it like the rings of Saturn?

889
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:05,900
They're tight.

890
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:08,300
Yeah, should I pull them up?

891
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:10,400
- I think so.
- It's like they're...

892
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:13,700
Genevieve!

893
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:17,000
- Genevieve!
- What?

894
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:20,800
No.

895
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:23,700
I know. I'm so sorry.
Nobody saw.

896
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:25,500
- Really?
- Yeah, I don't think so.

897
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:28,200
Maybe a lot of people.
No, I don't think so.

898
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,900
- I know what will cheer you up.
- What?

899
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:35,300
There's a really, really cute guy
working at the second run movie theater.

900
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:37,400
They always smell like dust.

901
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:39,800
- Yeah, I love that.
- Okay, go flirt.

902
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,900
- Don't scrapbook him.
- I'll try.

903
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:52,300
<i>- Hi, Mom.
- What are you doing?</i>

904
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:54,000
<i>- Nothing.
- Has he called?</i>

905
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:56,100
<i>I think he's gonna call you.</i>

906
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:02,300
<i>Pride, it ruins relationships.</i>

907
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:04,400
- Look, we have to do something.
- Yeah, we do.

908
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:06,400
Why can't she just admit
she wants another date?

909
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:09,100
- Why can't he say it first?
- 'Cause guys don't do that.

910
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:11,700
But that's the problem. We not only
have to figure out our own feelings...

911
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:14,000
we have to tell you what's going on
in your tiny heads.

912
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:16,600
No, no, we have to do everything!
We have to plan the date...

913
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:19,000
have to make sure it's something
you've never done before...

914
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:20,300
have to think of romantic gifts
for you...

915
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:23,000
- There you go.
- We have to listen to you.

916
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:26,100
"Please, tell me more about
how you're a mixed media artist...

917
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:28,700
who used to work only exclusively
with 'found objects'...

918
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:30,700
but now you work with cork."

919
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,400
Look, Genevieve has been nothing
but kind to us, right?

920
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:37,800
And she's always there to listen to us
and give us advice...

921
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:39,400
whenever, and wherever,
we need it.

922
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:42,100
- I would be lost without her.
- We would all be lost without her.

923
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:44,300
You guys, before you met
Genevieve...

924
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:47,100
had you ever kissed
anything not made of plastic?

925
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:50,300
<i>- Four dates?
- Yes!</i>

926
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:01,900
Shut it!
Shut it! Shut it!

927
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:05,000
How's about you finish
what you started?

928
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:09,300
- Yeah.
- Right?

929
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:18,900
Hey, we got an invitation.

930
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:23,400
"To all who made Get On Tapas
a success...

931
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:26,800
please join us for a Spanish Feast
of the Assumption August fifteenth.

932
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:29,000
See you there!
Greg Gatlin."

933
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:35,200
Well, someone is making assumptions
we're all available August fifteenth.

934
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:40,800
And making assumptions we care whether
his restaurant broke the stupid curse.

935
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:44,500
He's not even Spanish.
Poser.

936
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:46,900
We're going.

937
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:49,100
Have a good time.

938
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:52,100
We're all going.
You will wear a pretty dress.

939
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:55,600
Plus lipstick. And I'm gonna wax
those eyebrows right now.

940
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:57,400
Bill, get more glue sticks.

941
00:59:57,700 --> 01:00:00,400
Her legs are so hairy
it looks like she's wearing pants.

942
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:03,500
Come here, Steve Carell's chest.

943
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:04,700
No.

944
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:32,400
Bartender, a drink for the lady.

945
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:34,500
What's your plan?

946
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:37,000
Okay, around ten o'clock, I...

947
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:40,600
The stroke of midnight.

948
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,500
Okay, at the stroke of midnight...

949
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:47,400
I'm gonna present her
with these roses on this comb.

950
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:49,600
Dude, did you make that yourself?

951
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:52,300
Lose the comb.
Just give her roses.

952
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:54,900
Okay.

953
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:59,800
At the stroke of midnight, I'm going to
present her with some roses, no comb...

954
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:01,900
and ask for the other date...

955
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:04,400
which, depending on your interpretation
of five dates...

956
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:06,000
'cause I do think
that I counted correctly...

957
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:08,500
No, no, no!
Cut that last part.

958
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:12,900
- Okay.
- Now make it right.

959
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:16,400
Okay. Scatter.

960
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,600
- Sorry.
- Hey...

961
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:26,300
Ginger.

962
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:29,000
- You changed your hair.
- What's going on?

963
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:32,700
But you had your five dates.
You're done. My turn.

964
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:35,900
Go get some air, all right?

965
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:38,200
You had your five dates.

966
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:41,700
You had your five dates
and you're done? I see.

967
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:45,200
I see, so you just hand me off
to your shallow friend?

968
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:47,200
You... you know
I didn't hand you off.

969
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:50,000
- Still you are not a gentleman.
- What?

970
01:01:50,100 --> 01:01:53,300
- You suddenly decide four dates is five?
- It was five.

971
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:55,600
No, a sleepover
doesn't count as a date!

972
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,400
Sorry. I didn't read
your instruction manual.

973
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:00,100
What does that mean?

974
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:03,400
It means that you act like
you believe "c'est la vie"...

975
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:07,700
"have fun, everyone, there are
no rules". But you are all rules.

976
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:09,100
You control everything.

977
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:12,900
Who will woo you, for exactly how long,
five dates, then good-bye.

978
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:17,100
You entered this willingly and then
you blame me 'cause you can't count?

979
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:20,500
I get it now.
I just figured it out.

980
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:25,400
You are so scared of being hurt that
you pretend to have this philosophy...

981
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:27,800
about relationships
not being normal.

982
01:02:28,100 --> 01:02:31,500
Your fear of intimacy is only matched
by your ridiculous fantasy life.

983
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:35,100
You act like you live in the opening
credits of some French film.

984
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:38,100
You control everything
so it doesn't turn into something real.

985
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:42,100
I like French films.

986
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,600
Well, they're not real.
Just like you.

987
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:53,100
- Here he comes.
- Dude, now...

988
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:59,100
You can catch them
on your tongue.

989
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:02,800
Wanna go?

990
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,100
- Yup. Yeah.
- Big time.

991
01:03:06,100 --> 01:03:07,000
No!

992
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,600
Maybe you should go back
and talk to him.

993
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:18,200
No...

994
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:20,400
he hates me.

995
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:28,200
I feel naked.

996
01:03:28,700 --> 01:03:31,600
I feel like Greg can see
right through me.

997
01:03:31,900 --> 01:03:35,000
So? Does being vulnerable
make you weak?

998
01:03:36,700 --> 01:03:38,500
It's so my mom.

999
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:46,900
I never understood why my mom
let my dad see...

1000
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:48,700
her pain.

1001
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:52,400
I wanted her to act like...

1002
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:56,400
"Well, you cheated, get out".

1003
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:58,900
But she...

1004
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:02,500
cried to him.

1005
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:08,900
I remember when she found out.

1006
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:12,000
She sat down
at the kitchen table...

1007
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:17,800
and her eyes
went back and forth...

1008
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,700
as if she was trying to add
something in her head.

1009
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,600
And then he left.

1010
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:33,200
And you decided no one would ever
make you feel that way.

1011
01:04:39,100 --> 01:04:40,000
Well...

1012
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:43,600
it's over.

1013
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:52,700
It's over.

1014
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:57,100
That's no fair.
I wasn't looking. Do-over.

1015
01:04:57,800 --> 01:04:58,600
Get up.

1016
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:01,100
No. I'm good.

1017
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:20,300
- You dodged a bullet, buddy.
- No, I didn't.

1018
01:05:21,100 --> 01:05:22,700
No, you didn't.

1019
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:44,600
I'd love to go on a date with you.
I'll be back at the shop in 5 minutes.

1020
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:59,900
<i>Yo, everybody,
it's ten minutes until midnight!</i>

1021
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:02,400
<i>Hey, guys,
it's almost midnight!</i>

1022
01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:06,400
Cal says you like wine?

1023
01:06:07,700 --> 01:06:09,200
Do you have any Zinfandel?

1024
01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:21,000
Same thing.

1025
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:23,800
A spritzer.

1026
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:26,800
Yummy.

1027
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:28,600
You're so inventive.

1028
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:32,500
So anyway, my sister,
not the bipolar one, the other one...

1029
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:43,400
- Hi.
- I'm seeing someone.

1030
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:47,300
Boy, that's great.

1031
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:49,400
Yeah, but it's new.

1032
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:53,000
Do you have any love advice
for me?

1033
01:06:53,900 --> 01:06:57,100
Mom, I don't think
you want advice from me.

1034
01:06:57,800 --> 01:06:59,300
Shut up, it's time!

1035
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:03,700
Five, four, three, two, one!

1036
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:06,600
Happy New Year!

1037
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:15,200
My eyes are bleeding!

1038
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:18,100
Mom!

1039
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:20,100
You're dating John?

1040
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:23,400
Yeah, he's ten years
younger than me.

1041
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:26,000
I'm a cougar!

1042
01:07:28,100 --> 01:07:29,500
<i>And I'm a young buck!</i>

1043
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:32,200
- I forgot.
- Okay.

1044
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:33,400
I made you...

1045
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:36,500
a scrapbook of your life.

1046
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:38,900
I askjeeved, googled...

1047
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:41,800
and classmates. Commed you and...

1048
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:46,200
there is a whole page of collage
of your lips.

1049
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:50,600
I love it!

1050
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:52,700
You're adorable.

1051
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:56,500
And I got you this paperweight
that magnifies your baby picture.

1052
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:28,700
- Oops.
- Uh-oh.

1053
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:30,500
Oops.

1054
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:33,200
Uh-oh.

1055
01:08:33,300 --> 01:08:35,300
- Table for one.
- Only the lonely.

1056
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:37,700
- Serving only the lonely.
- It's lovely out here.

1057
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:40,100
- It's chilly, isn't it?
- Do you know anyone we know out here?

1058
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:42,800
- No. I used to.
- Who's that?

1059
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:45,400
She looks like someone
we used to know.

1060
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:49,400
She was the most romantic,
happy person who loved love.

1061
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,100
Then she turned
into a shriveled twisted...

1062
01:08:52,300 --> 01:08:53,200
Stop.

1063
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,300
I think...

1064
01:08:55,700 --> 01:08:59,000
you need to tell Greg
that you're scared.

1065
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:03,700
You know, you think this is fear.

1066
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:05,500
This is instinct.

1067
01:09:05,900 --> 01:09:09,100
Avoiding pain is how humans
have survived.

1068
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:11,900
You think we'd still be here
if we didn't know...

1069
01:09:12,100 --> 01:09:15,600
"look, there's a saber-toothed tiger.
Let's run before it eats us"?

1070
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:18,100
Honey, did you just see
your mom?

1071
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:19,700
I did.

1072
01:09:20,900 --> 01:09:21,900
Let go.

1073
01:09:24,100 --> 01:09:25,500
Forgive the past.

1074
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:31,500
- Hey. What is that? What are you doing?
- It's a moment.

1075
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:35,500
Can we give you some advice?

1076
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,000
No.

1077
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:42,700
All right, bring it.

1078
01:09:43,900 --> 01:09:45,800
Woo him.

1079
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,100
<i>You baked him muffins?</i>

1080
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:09,600
<i>Isn't that a tiny bit
''think of me as your cousin Ethel"?</i>

1081
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:12,900
Really? It took me all night
to think of that.

1082
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:17,500
This is hard. What do guys like
besides pizza and morning sex?

1083
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:20,900
Okay, I have to focus.
I have to focus.

1084
01:10:21,100 --> 01:10:24,300
I have to think, what does he want?
What does he want?

1085
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:27,100
Because he will call me,
he will call me.

1086
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:28,900
<i>He will call me.</i>

1087
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:33,700
So...

1088
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:36,500
he sent a thank you note?

1089
01:10:37,700 --> 01:10:39,100
Still no call?

1090
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:44,400
What does this even mean?
What does it mean?

1091
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:47,200
"Genevieve,
thank you for the gifts.

1092
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:48,600
Grrrrrrreg."

1093
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,700
I don't...
I don't know what else to do.

1094
01:10:51,900 --> 01:10:55,300
I've sent Rangers tickets
and chocolates and "Simpsons" DVDs.

1095
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:57,500
I mean, I don't get it!
What do men want?

1096
01:10:57,700 --> 01:11:00,900
A cellulite seaweed wrap, a diamond
dog collar, and a karaoke machine.

1097
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:03,300
Karaoke's a no.

1098
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:14,400
- Can I cancel it?
- No. We'd be out of business.

1099
01:11:18,700 --> 01:11:20,200
It's gonna suck.

1100
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:22,800
Yes, but it always does.

1101
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:31,400
Roses For Whatever.

1102
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:35,400
A thank you note?

1103
01:11:35,700 --> 01:11:38,600
She sent you all those gifts
and you didn't call?

1104
01:11:39,700 --> 01:11:40,800
I wanna call.

1105
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:43,800
Am I an idiot?

1106
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
In general?
I don't know.

1107
01:11:46,700 --> 01:11:49,900
Love makes you crazy.
You should call her.

1108
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:53,500
I said horrible things to her.
What do I say now?

1109
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:57,500
And the probability ratio of a failed
relationship working...

1110
01:11:57,800 --> 01:11:59,000
zero to none.

1111
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:02,700
But this never was a relationship.

1112
01:12:58,700 --> 01:13:00,300
Come on!

1113
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:05,000
Stupid fake holyday.

1114
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:07,800
I know! It's just a day
of pressure, isn't it?

1115
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,600
I mean, even if you're
in a relationship, which I'm not...

1116
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:13,100
it's just a day that
makes you feel inadequate.

1117
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:15,800
Am I doing enough for this person?
Did I get a big enough gift?

1118
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,800
Do I even know this person?

1119
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:20,200
And what about those candy hearts?
"Be Mine".

1120
01:13:20,300 --> 01:13:22,500
Like you gotta be somebody's
to matter, right?

1121
01:13:22,700 --> 01:13:25,500
I mean, I'm not anybody's now,
but I've been, before.

1122
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:35,000
Chocolates for Genevieve!

1123
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:37,100
Happy Valentine's Day!

1124
01:13:37,300 --> 01:13:41,200
John, it's a good day for you
because you're dating my mom.

1125
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:44,300
A visual, that if I let it burn
through my retinas...

1126
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:48,200
will seara hole through my skull
and my brain will leak onto my neck.

1127
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:50,700
This is why you are happy
on this day.

1128
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,900
I have seen this day for what it is,
a hollow sham.

1129
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:57,200
I will sell many roses
to many fools on this day...

1130
01:13:57,400 --> 01:13:59,400
who have not seen the light
as I have.

1131
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:02,300
Valentine's Day blows!

1132
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:14,300
Don't get your hopes up today.
Some man will just crush 'em.

1133
01:14:19,300 --> 01:14:20,200
Mine!

1134
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:24,100
Roses For Fooling Yourself
That Romance Exists.

1135
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:26,500
- You want to work in the back today.
- May I help you?

1136
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:29,100
- Okay, who was first?
- I was!

1137
01:14:39,700 --> 01:14:40,600
Tim.

1138
01:14:41,100 --> 01:14:43,300
Hey, what's up?

1139
01:14:43,700 --> 01:14:44,600
Tim...

1140
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:48,800
I don't know anything about
anything anymore. What do I do?

1141
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:52,900
How do I know? I'm from the world of
"Not tonight, the kid puked on me".

1142
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:55,900
Yeah, but sometimes...

1143
01:14:56,300 --> 01:14:58,200
it's nice, right?

1144
01:15:03,700 --> 01:15:06,400
This morning, the kids were
running around like crazy...

1145
01:15:06,700 --> 01:15:09,700
Annie's standing in the kitchen
making pancakes.

1146
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:12,600
Hair's all messed up...

1147
01:15:12,900 --> 01:15:16,300
her breath could've knocked
a buzzard off a portapotty and...

1148
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:22,200
when she wasn't looking, I reached out
and took the pancake syrup and...

1149
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:25,600
I spelled "Happy V-Day" out
on her plate.

1150
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:31,800
She cried, you know?

1151
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:40,200
Do I have it all wrong?

1152
01:15:41,700 --> 01:15:43,300
Is that what love is?

1153
01:15:46,700 --> 01:15:48,500
Well, you know, it's not...

1154
01:15:48,900 --> 01:15:51,400
butterflies in my tummy love,
you know...

1155
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:55,800
but, you know, even on the bad days,
you get there...

1156
01:15:57,100 --> 01:15:59,100
you see her and the kids...

1157
01:16:00,100 --> 01:16:01,400
and yeah, think...

1158
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:03,100
yeah...

1159
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:07,100
it's good to be home.

1160
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:13,600
Anyway, that's what love is to me.

1161
01:16:18,100 --> 01:16:19,000
Yeah.

1162
01:16:20,700 --> 01:16:21,700
Yeah.

1163
01:16:23,100 --> 01:16:25,000
Tell the boys I need to go.

1164
01:16:41,700 --> 01:16:42,600
Hi, Dad.

1165
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:46,200
Genevieve.

1166
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,900
Jeez, it's so good to see you.

1167
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:53,600
How are you?

1168
01:16:57,500 --> 01:16:58,400
Dad...

1169
01:16:59,700 --> 01:17:01,900
you never should have
cheated on Mom.

1170
01:17:06,100 --> 01:17:07,100
Well...

1171
01:17:08,900 --> 01:17:12,200
I don't see how my relationship
with your mother concerns you.

1172
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:16,800
Well, guess what?
It does.

1173
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:19,500
It messed us all up.

1174
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:22,700
It really hurt Mom, and...

1175
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:26,100
how was I ever supposed
to trust a man after that?

1176
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:27,900
It changed me.

1177
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:30,700
It's taken me years
to figure this out.

1178
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:35,200
I thought all I ever did
was fall in love...

1179
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:39,000
but really,
I made sure I never did.

1180
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:45,500
So, yeah it does concern me.

1181
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:47,600
And you were wrong to do it.

1182
01:17:53,500 --> 01:17:54,800
But I love you.

1183
01:17:55,700 --> 01:17:56,600
Good-bye.

1184
01:18:15,700 --> 01:18:18,700
Boy, I can't wait to get home
to my old lady.

1185
01:18:19,300 --> 01:18:23,000
Did you get her a Valentine's card that
says, "Hey, old lady, glad you're alive"?

1186
01:18:24,300 --> 01:18:26,000
I meant my dog.

1187
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:28,400
She's old and her name is Lady.

1188
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:31,300
Sorry.

1189
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,700
I like old things.

1190
01:18:37,100 --> 01:18:39,500
Lady was eleven
when I got her from the pound.

1191
01:18:42,700 --> 01:18:44,300
That antique stool?

1192
01:18:44,900 --> 01:18:47,800
I found that when I was in Kentucky
on the road.

1193
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:50,400
It's almost two hundred years old.

1194
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:53,800
Don't you find that kinda creepy?

1195
01:18:54,300 --> 01:18:56,900
Like you can still see
the old dead guy sitting on it?

1196
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,300
Well, I do now.

1197
01:19:06,300 --> 01:19:07,300
Good talk.

1198
01:19:12,700 --> 01:19:14,300
Hey, you're out of T.p.

1199
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:16,800
Any girls show up looking for me?

1200
01:19:16,900 --> 01:19:18,900
I hooked us up
with some paralegals.

1201
01:19:19,100 --> 01:19:21,600
You get Melissa, I get Doreen.
No, wait a minute.

1202
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:25,100
Why do I stand here, with my hands
in my metaphorical pockets...

1203
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:28,300
chained to my comfortable
spot of fear?

1204
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:33,400
Are you rehearsing for a play?

1205
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:36,300
No, man,
I'm talking about Genevieve.

1206
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:37,400
Come on.

1207
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:41,700
I miss her.
I want to see her again.

1208
01:19:43,500 --> 01:19:46,000
By summer,
I want to lose five pounds.

1209
01:19:47,500 --> 01:19:48,800
I blew it, man.

1210
01:19:49,300 --> 01:19:51,900
- I'm a complete moron.
- We're guys.

1211
01:19:52,300 --> 01:19:55,200
It's an accepted fact of our sex
that we do stupid stuff.

1212
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:01,900
What'd you say?

1213
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:04,000
I need to shed the lbs,
I'm getting chunky.

1214
01:20:04,100 --> 01:20:06,800
No, no, no, about guys
doing stupid stuff.

1215
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:08,800
I don't know.
I don't listen.

1216
01:20:11,100 --> 01:20:12,900
Men do stupid things.

1217
01:20:13,300 --> 01:20:16,400
Yes, yeah. Think about it, I mean,
that's how great things happen.

1218
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:18,200
Take the Wright Brothers.

1219
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:21,900
What is smart about jumping off a cliff
strapped to wooden wings?

1220
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:23,500
Wood is heavy.

1221
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:27,500
That's it!
I gotta do something stupid.

1222
01:20:29,300 --> 01:20:30,800
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1223
01:20:31,100 --> 01:20:33,000
- What's open?
- What's happening?

1224
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:51,000
- May I borrow that?
- For two bucks you can own it.

1225
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:53,400
- Deal.
- Plus a week's free tapas.

1226
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:54,900
- Make it a month.
- Deal.

1227
01:20:54,900 --> 01:20:56,700
- Cal, get me some scissors.
- Cut that up.

1228
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:39,100
I'm alive, okay?

1229
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:42,100
<i>Yeah, but are you watching
"Jerry Maguire"again?</i>

1230
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:43,800
No, I am not.

1231
01:21:44,300 --> 01:21:47,000
<i>Wait, is that jazz
outside your window?</i>

1232
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,200
It is.

1233
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:52,300
Yuck, jazz!

1234
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:03,200
<i>- What are you doing?
- Genevieve!</i>

1235
01:22:05,100 --> 01:22:07,100
Here's stuff that scares you.

1236
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:10,500
Here's something that scares me.

1237
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:15,900
<i>If I can't love you</i>

1238
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:18,000
<i>Till the day I die</i>

1239
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:20,800
<i>Then maybe</i>

1240
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:23,000
<i>Baby</i>

1241
01:22:23,300 --> 01:22:25,200
<i>What good am I?</i>

1242
01:22:25,900 --> 01:22:29,800
<i>If I can't reach out
And know that you'll be there</i>

1243
01:22:30,300 --> 01:22:33,800
<i>Then this whole world
Ain't spinning anywhere</i>

1244
01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:39,100
<i>'Cause there's no livin'
Without your lovin'</i>

1245
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:43,400
<i>Without the thrill
Of your magic touch</i>

1246
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:48,100
<i>There's no livin'
Without your lovin', baby...</i>

1247
01:22:48,700 --> 01:22:50,300
You're an idiot!

1248
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:52,400
No, you are, but I love you!

1249
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:55,800
Well, that makes you
a bigger idiot.

1250
01:22:57,500 --> 01:22:59,000
And I love you, too!

1251
01:23:00,700 --> 01:23:02,000
Now go away.

1252
01:23:02,500 --> 01:23:04,900
Okay, everybody, on three.

1253
01:23:05,300 --> 01:23:07,200
One, two...

1254
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:09,200
three!

1255
01:23:15,700 --> 01:23:16,900
Genevieve...

1256
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:19,800
will you be my Valentine?

1257
01:23:53,500 --> 01:23:56,100
- You're still an idiot.
- So are you.

1258
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:00,100
Enough of your dumb system.
Are you my girlfriend?

1259
01:24:01,900 --> 01:24:02,800
Yeah.

1260
01:24:03,500 --> 01:24:06,400
I'm your girlfriend.
You're my boyfriend.

1261
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,200
Some relationships work,
you know.

1262
01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:12,000
Look, I'm willing to try,
but I think we should set some rules...

1263
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:13,300
because I don't know
what we're getting...

1264
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:14,600
Stop talking.

1265
01:24:16,500 --> 01:24:17,500
Make me.
