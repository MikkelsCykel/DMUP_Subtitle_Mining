this guy up to pitch this game.

at that? This guy, he's got nothin' now.

and that they will happen.

you something about what I know-

about how sometimes life seems
like it's slamming you down,

Back goes Mickey Hart
to the track at the wall...

[ Lyons ] What a play by
Mickey Hart right here.

1381

This is a ball right out over the

You got lucky again, Chapel.
That was a great play.

this far into a game for a lot of starts now.

Franklin, the local boy from New York.

and makes the play.

1404
01:44:57,506 --> 01:45:02,761
Chapel has done it for eight,
retiring 24 consecutive batters.

1405
01:45:02,845 --> 01:45:07,307
Billy Chapel is certainly getting more
than a little help from his friends.

he sits in the dugout here at Yankee Stadium.

01:50:26,001 --> 01:50:29,213
Forty years old,
arm weary and aching.

And don't let anybody tell you

in a brilliant,
19-year career.

1473

But never before, in all those
years and in all those innings,

1474
01:50:46,647 --> 01:50:51,026
has he ever had a date with
destiny as he has right now.

1475

Billy Chapel, in quest
of the perfect game.

1479
01:51:25,227 --> 01:51:30,065
You also realize he may very well be
at the crossroads of a brilliant career.

1480
01:51:30,149 --> 01:51:32,818
He's a cinch to wind up
in the Hall of Fame.

1481
01:51:32,901 --> 01:51:36,572
However, after this game,
he has to make the big decision.

1482
01:51:36,697 --> 01:51:39,992
A: Will he continue to do
what has been his life,

1483
01:51:40,075 --> 01:51:42,578
maybe more important
than life itself, baseball?

1484
01:51:42,703 --> 01:51:45,205
Or will he hang it up,
and would a perfect game...

1485
01:51:45,330 --> 01:51:49,001
give him the logical
conclusion to the great career?

1488
01:52:26,955 --> 01:52:30,083
[ Scully ] At 40 years old,
Billy Chapel is flirting...

1489
01:52:30,167 --> 01:52:33,462
with perhaps the greatest
accomplishment in baseball.

1490

Then Jesus Cabrillo.

1492
01:52:40,469 --> 01:52:43,639
And Ken Strout has a bat
in his hands in the dugout...

1493
01:52:43,764 --> 01:52:48,477
and might very well get
the call to bat for Jaime Ruiz.

1494
01:52:49,978 --> 01:52:52,314
And, you know, Steve, you get
the feeling that Billy Chapel...

1495
01:52:52,439 --> 01:52:55,067
isn't pitching
against left-handers.

1496
01:52:55,150 --> 01:52:57,694
He isn't pitching
against pinch hitters.

1497
01:52:57,820 --> 01:53:00,030
He isn't pitching
against the Yankees.

1498
01:53:00,155 --> 01:53:04,618
He's pitching against time. He's pitching
against the future, against age...

1499
01:53:04,701 --> 01:53:08,497
and, even when you think about
his career, against ending.

1500
01:53:08,622 --> 01:53:13,085
And tonight, I think he might be able to
use that aching old arm one more time...

1501

01:55:06,949 --> 01:55:09,993
and then go up there cold and
have to try and swing the bat.

1522
01:55:10,119 --> 01:55:12,579
But if you don't get your pitch
and hack at it early,

1523
01:55:12,704 --> 01:55:14,623
you might not see one
for the rest of the at bat.

1524
01:55:14,748 --> 01:55:16,917
[ Scully ]
Matt Crane poses quite a threat,

1525
01:55:17,042 --> 01:55:19,878
especially now when Billy
has to be on the ropes.

1526
01:55:19,962 --> 01:55:24,925
No, Gus. A curve
would hurt too much.

1527
01:55:30,055 --> 01:55:34,560
[ Scully ] Ground ball to the right side,
smothered back at third base by Lee Giordano...

1528
01:55:34,643 --> 01:55:36,812
- He's out!
- and throws him out!

1529
01:55:36,937 --> 01:55:40,858
[ Scully ] That would
be another brilliant play.

1530
01:55:40,983 --> 01:55:43,193
No! He beat it!

1531
01:55:52,494 --> 01:55:56,582
[ Scully ] Two more outs to
go, and here's Jesus Cabrillo,

1532
01:55:56,665 --> 01:56:00,627
who struck out
and flied to center.

1533
01:56:00,711 --> 01:56:04,506
It's been over 40 years
that I sat at Yankee Stadium...

1534

and broadcast the perfect game
by Don Larson in the World Series,

1535
01:56:09,970 --> 01:56:13,974
and now I never thought
I'd be able to see another one,

1536
01:56:14,099 --> 01:56:19,271
especially from a 40-year-old pitcher who
may very well be at the end of his career.

1537
01:56:19,354 --> 01:56:21,565
Gus, goddamn it.

1538
01:56:21,690 --> 01:56:23,650
Gus, just hold it
over the middle of the plate.

1539
01:56:23,775 --> 01:56:26,195
I'm just throwin'
straight shit right now.

1540
01:56:31,867 --> 01:56:33,786
[ Scully ]
Big swing and the count 0 and 1.

1541
01:56:33,869 --> 01:56:37,623
What are you swingin' at? That
was a ball. This guy's a bum!

1542

[ Groans ]

1543
01:56:51,553 --> 01:56:54,723
[ Scully ]
There's a drive down the line.

1544
01:56:54,848 --> 01:56:57,768
Foul!
What a scramble up there.

1545
01:56:57,893 --> 01:57:00,020
What used to be
just a souvenir...

1546
01:57:00,145 --> 01:57:04,566
might very well turn out
to be a very valuable baseball.

1547
01:57:05,984 --> 01:57:09,530
[ Booing ]
Oh, God.

1548
01:57:09,655 --> 01:57:12,199
[ Chapel ]
Yeah, I know, I'm stallin'.

1549

Everybody knows I'm stallin'.

Maybe you'd be stallin' too.

1552
01:57:36,098 --> 01:57:38,433
[ Scully ] And there's a
strike three call. Strike!

1553

Billy Chapel, striking out Jesus
Cabrillo for his ninth strikeout,

1554
01:57:42,938 --> 01:57:44,815
and he is one out away...
Ken.

1555
01:57:44,940 --> 01:57:46,483
from the perfect game.

1556
01:57:46,608 --> 01:57:49,778
- Wreck it.
- All right, skip.

1557
01:57:49,903 --> 01:57:53,115
[ Scully ]
On deck is young ken Strout,

1558
01:57:53,198 --> 01:57:56,743
who will take
his swings for Jaime Ruiz.

1559
01:57:56,827 --> 01:58:02,332
[ Man On P.A.] Batting for
Ruiz, number 60, ken Strout.

Why not?

1561
01:58:13,385 --> 01:58:17,723
[ Lyons ] This is a great move
by Bobby Mack, the Yankee skipper,

1562
01:58:17,806 --> 01:58:20,767
sendin'a kid up, ken Strout,
his first major league at bat.

1563
01:58:20,851 --> 01:58:23,729
He's just young enough and just
cocky enough to not realize...

1564
01:58:23,812 --> 01:58:26,398
the magnitude of
the situation that he's in.

1565
01:58:30,152 --> 01:58:33,155
[ Scully ] There's a line
drive down the right field line,

1566
01:58:33,238 --> 01:58:36,200
hooking foul!

1567
01:58:36,325 --> 01:58:41,205
And that was too close for comfort
for the Tigers and for Billy Chapel.

1568
01:58:44,333 --> 01:58:49,671
Well, I don't scare you
at all, do I, Strout?

1569
01:58:49,755 --> 01:58:52,174
Guess you forgot who I am.

[ Chuckles ]
Oh, God.

Think Billy.
Don't just throw.

1573
01:59:06,814 --> 01:59:11,276
No, a curveball's for shit.
He knows it. I know it.

1574
01:59:15,197 --> 01:59:17,741
He knows it.

1575
01:59:19,326 --> 01:59:21,745
This is gonna hurt
a little bit.

1576

[ Groans ]

1577
01:59:24,915 --> 01:59:27,543
Strike two! [ Scully

1578
01:59:27,668 --> 01:59:31,672
"If you can keep your head when
all about you are losing theirs,

you don't understand
the situation. "

1580
01:59:33,549 --> 01:59:37,553
That's kenny Strout right now as he takes
another strike. The count is 0 and 2.

1581
01:59:37,678 --> 01:59:41,932
And with a weary body
and, no doubt, a sore arm,

01:59:42,057 --> 01:59:46,562
now this big crowd, over 56,000,
rooting for Billy Chapel...

to do the near impossible.

It's either gonna be
your night, kid, or mine.

1585
01:59:55,737 --> 01:59:58,657
[ Scully ] Will this be
the last pitch of the game?

1586
01:59:58,740 --> 02:00:02,494
Will this be the last pitch
in Billy Chapel's life?

1587
02:00:02,578 --> 02:00:06,165
Will it be the end of his
brilliant major league career?

1588
02:00:06,248 --> 02:00:08,667
And if so, what a high note!

1589
02:00:08,750 --> 02:00:11,587

to kenny Strout.

Come on, Billy.

off the glove of Chapel!

- [ Scully ] He has done it.

1673
02:11:58,961 --> 02:12:03,465
Like the back of my hand

1674
02:12:03,590 --> 02:12:07,261
Loving you

1675
02:12:07,344 --> 02:12:10,764
Makes me a better man

1676
02:12:13,725 --> 02:12:17,437
I've been wrong

1677
02:12:17,521 --> 02:12:21,441
More than I care to say

1678
02:12:23,861 --> 02:12:27,656
Time after time
I've been lost

1679
02:12:27,781 --> 02:12:31,326
Just couldn't find my way

1680
02:12:34,079 --> 02:12:38,292
You shed a light on
a path through the night

1681
02:12:38,417 --> 02:12:43,130
Leading right to the site
where I stand

1682
02:12:44,298 --> 02:12:48,010
Loving you

1683
02:12:48,135 --> 02:12:52,306
Makes me a better man

1684
02:13:26,048 --> 02:13:30,052
Boy, you blow my mind

1685
02:13:30,177 --> 02:13:32,554
You can make me crazy

1686
02:13:32,679 --> 02:13:36,350
You make me laugh You make me
cry keepin'my heart shook up

1687
02:13:36,433 --> 02:13:41,688
I'm so mesmerized, you're
the one who can save me

1688
02:13:41,772 --> 02:13:44,233
So say good-bye
Don't lead a lie

1689
02:13:44,358 --> 02:13:46,860
I think it's time
for the breakup

1690
02:13:46,985 --> 02:13:51,907
Baby, you're
my main attraction

1691
02:13:52,032 --> 02:13:56,745
Settin'off
this chain reaction

1692
02:13:56,870 --> 02:13:59,289
Just a little is enough Just
the thought of your touch

1693
02:13:59,414 --> 02:14:02,835
That's the fun of your love
I la love, baby

1694
02:14:02,918 --> 02:14:07,047
Oh, oh, oh, yeah

1695
02:14:07,131 --> 02:14:09,383
The feeling inside That's
the thrill of the ride

1696
02:14:09,466 --> 02:14:13,095
That's the fun of your love

1697
02:14:13,220 --> 02:14:17,307
Oh, oh, oh

Let the days unwind

1699
02:14:19,935 --> 02:14:23,772
Let the dreams come true

1700
02:14:23,856 --> 02:14:27,317
Happy ever after, baby

1701
