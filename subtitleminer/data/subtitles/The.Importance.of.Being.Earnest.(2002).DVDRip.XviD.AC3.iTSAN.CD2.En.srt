1
00:00:07,384 --> 00:00:11,059
- Mr Ernest Worthing? B4, The Albany?
- Yes, that is my address.

2
00:00:12,184 --> 00:00:15,540
Very sorry, sir,
but I have a writ against you

3
00:00:15,744 --> 00:00:20,295
at the suit of the Savoy Hotel Company
Limited for 762 pounds, 14 shillings.

4
00:00:20,504 --> 00:00:23,860
I never dine at the Savoy
at my own expense.

5
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:29,457
We have no option but to take out
an order for committal of your person.

6
00:00:29,664 --> 00:00:33,373
- Committal of my person?
- For six months.

7
00:00:33,584 --> 00:00:36,263
- Six months?
- You'll prefer to pay the bill.

8
00:00:36,264 --> 00:00:40,496
How on earth can I do that?
No gentleman ever has any money.

9
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:44,538
In my experience,
it is usually relations who pay.

10
00:00:44,744 --> 00:00:48,235
Quite right. Brother Jack?

11
00:00:55,104 --> 00:01:00,337
762 pounds 14 shillings and tuppence
since last October.

12
00:01:01,984 --> 00:01:07,263
I'm bound to say I never saw
such reckless extravagance in all my life.

13
00:01:08,744 --> 00:01:12,896
My dear fellow, you have your debts
and I have mine.

14
00:01:13,104 --> 00:01:14,903
This bill is yours.

15
00:01:14,904 --> 00:01:17,543
- Mine?
- Yes, and you know it!

16
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:20,934
- If this is a jest, it is out of place.
- It is not!

17
00:01:21,144 --> 00:01:23,743
Gross effrontery! Just what I expected!

18
00:01:23,744 --> 00:01:26,542
And it is ingratitude. I didn't expect that.

19
00:01:26,744 --> 00:01:30,532
Next, he'll be denying
he's Ernest Worthing in the first place.

20
00:01:32,544 --> 00:01:36,503
Sorry to have disturbed so pleasant
a family meeting, but time presses.

21
00:01:36,704 --> 00:01:42,256
We have to be at Holloway not later than
4 o'clock or one cannot obtain admission.

22
00:01:42,464 --> 00:01:45,456
Holloway? Get off me!

23
00:01:45,664 --> 00:01:48,224
It is at Holloway that detentions
are made.

24
00:01:48,424 --> 00:01:52,975
I will not be imprisoned in the suburbs
for having dined in the West End!

25
00:01:53,184 --> 00:01:54,617
Jack!

26
00:01:56,144 --> 00:01:59,261
I agree to settle my brother's accounts...

27
00:01:59,464 --> 00:02:04,413
...on the condition that he makes his way
to the bedside of the bedridden Bunbury,

28
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:07,855
whose health, I have been informed,
is rapidly declining.

29
00:02:09,944 --> 00:02:12,504
Well... Ernest?

30
00:02:55,024 --> 00:02:59,779
Mr Worthing, I would ask you
not to interrupt Miss Cardew's studies.

31
00:02:59,984 --> 00:03:03,943
Miss Prism, Dr Chasuble
is expecting you in the vestry.

32
00:03:04,144 --> 00:03:06,623
In the vestry? Dr Chasuble?

33
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:08,463
Expecting you, yes.

34
00:03:08,464 --> 00:03:13,174
That sounds serious. I do not think
it would be right to keep him waiting.

35
00:03:13,384 --> 00:03:17,935
It would be very wrong. The vestry is,
I am told, excessively damp.

36
00:03:31,904 --> 00:03:34,577
This parting is very painful.

37
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:37,742
You cannot desert Mr Bunbury
in his hour of need.

38
00:03:37,944 --> 00:03:42,540
I don't care about Bunbury any more.
I don't seem to care about anything.

39
00:03:42,744 --> 00:03:45,781
I only care for you. I love you, Cecily.

40
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:53,623
Will you marry me, Cecily?

41
00:03:53,624 --> 00:03:58,061
Of course. Why, we have been
engaged for the last three months.

42
00:04:00,024 --> 00:04:04,461
- For the last three months?
- Exactly three months on Thursday.

43
00:04:06,184 --> 00:04:07,742
Darling!

44
00:04:12,104 --> 00:04:15,460
So when was the engagement
actually settled?

45
00:04:15,664 --> 00:04:17,823
On the 14th February last.

46
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:21,817
After a long struggle with myself,
I accepted you under this tree.

47
00:04:22,664 --> 00:04:25,815
This is the box
in which I keep your letters.

48
00:04:26,024 --> 00:04:29,380
Letters? But I have never
written you any letters.

49
00:04:29,584 --> 00:04:34,453
You need hardly remind me. I was
forced to write your letters for you.

50
00:04:35,864 --> 00:04:38,143
I wrote always three times a week.

51
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:40,942
- Do let me look.
- No, I couldn't possibly.

52
00:04:41,144 --> 00:04:43,817
They would make you far too conceited.

53
00:04:44,024 --> 00:04:49,178
The three you wrote after I broke it off
are so beautiful and so badly spelled.

54
00:04:49,384 --> 00:04:51,943
I can hardly read them without crying.

55
00:04:51,944 --> 00:04:57,098
- Was our engagement broken off?
- Yes. On the 22nd of last March.

56
00:04:57,304 --> 00:05:01,193
You can see the entry if you like.

57
00:05:01,864 --> 00:05:04,423
"I broke off my engagement with Ernest."

58
00:05:04,424 --> 00:05:08,781
- "The weather continues charming."
- What had I done? Nothing at all!

59
00:05:08,984 --> 00:05:13,182
I am hurt you broke it off, particularly
when the weather was so charming.

60
00:05:13,384 --> 00:05:19,141
It'd hardly be a serious engagement
if I hadn't broken it off at least once.

61
00:05:19,344 --> 00:05:22,495
But I forgave you
before the week was out.

62
00:05:22,704 --> 00:05:24,863
You're a perfect angel.

63
00:05:24,864 --> 00:05:28,320
You dear romantic boy.

64
00:05:48,744 --> 00:05:53,499
I never really thought of myself
as the marrying kind until now.

65
00:05:53,704 --> 00:05:55,863
You mustn't break it off again.

66
00:05:55,864 --> 00:06:00,016
I don't think I could break it off
now that I've actually met you.

67
00:06:01,184 --> 00:06:03,903
Besides, there is the question
of your name.

68
00:06:06,424 --> 00:06:08,183
Yes, of course.

69
00:06:08,184 --> 00:06:13,338
It's always been a girlish dream of mine
to love someone named Ernest.

70
00:06:14,784 --> 00:06:18,936
There's something in that name
that seems to inspire confidence.

71
00:06:19,144 --> 00:06:22,898
Do you mean you couldn't love me
if I had another name?

72
00:06:23,104 --> 00:06:26,356
But what name?

73
00:06:27,584 --> 00:06:29,463
Algy, for instance.

74
00:06:29,464 --> 00:06:33,616
I might respect you, Ernest,
I might admire your character,

75
00:06:34,624 --> 00:06:39,539
but I fear that I would never be able
to give you my undivided attention.

76
00:06:44,944 --> 00:06:48,300
The dog cart is ready for you, sir.

77
00:06:48,504 --> 00:06:53,055
And now you must go, my love,
for sooner then shall you return.

78
00:06:57,144 --> 00:07:00,932
What a charming boy.
I like his hair so much.

79
00:07:08,984 --> 00:07:12,600
You wanted to see me, Dr Chasuble?

80
00:07:14,384 --> 00:07:15,658
I didn't.

81
00:07:19,704 --> 00:07:22,762
You didn't?

82
00:07:30,264 --> 00:07:34,382
I'm sorry, but merely for the purposes
of clarification,

83
00:07:34,584 --> 00:07:39,339
when you said you didn't, did you mean
you didn't say you wanted to see me

84
00:07:39,544 --> 00:07:42,297
or you didn't, in fact, want to see me?

85
00:07:47,744 --> 00:07:51,200
Isn't language a curious thing?

86
00:07:51,544 --> 00:07:57,460
Will you excuse me? I have a double
baptism and I have to top up the font.

87
00:08:27,464 --> 00:08:29,022
Bless you.

88
00:08:31,784 --> 00:08:34,935
A Miss Fairfax has called
to see Mr Worthing.

89
00:08:35,144 --> 00:08:38,102
On very important business,
Miss Fairfax states.

90
00:08:38,304 --> 00:08:41,660
He is sure to be out soon.
Kindly bring some tea.

91
00:08:41,864 --> 00:08:43,456
Yes, Miss.

92
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:49,063
- Miss Cardew.
- Thank you.

93
00:08:49,064 --> 00:08:53,694
Miss Fairfax, let me introduce myself.
My name is Cecily Cardew.

94
00:08:53,904 --> 00:08:57,021
Cecily Cardew. What a very sweet name.

95
00:08:57,224 --> 00:09:01,376
Something tells me we're going
to be great friends. I like you already.

96
00:09:01,584 --> 00:09:05,234
My first impressions are never wrong.

97
00:09:14,064 --> 00:09:17,295
- You are here on a short visit?
- No, I live here.

98
00:09:17,504 --> 00:09:23,056
Your mother or some female relative
of advanced years resides here also?

99
00:09:23,264 --> 00:09:25,583
I have no mother nor any relations.

100
00:09:25,584 --> 00:09:28,382
My guardian has the task
of looking after me.

101
00:09:28,584 --> 00:09:31,701
- Your guardian?
- Yes, I'm Mr Worthing's ward.

102
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:38,537
Strange, he never mentioned it.

103
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:42,532
How secretive of him.
He grows more interesting hourly.

104
00:09:44,104 --> 00:09:49,383
But I am bound to state that now that
I know you are Mr Worthing's ward,

105
00:09:49,584 --> 00:09:53,179
I cannot help expressing a wish
that you were, well,

106
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:57,741
a little older than you seem to be
and not so alluring in appearance.

107
00:09:58,784 --> 00:10:01,463
In fact, if I may speak candidly...

108
00:10:01,464 --> 00:10:06,254
I think, whenever one has anything
unpleasant to say, one should be candid.

109
00:10:07,504 --> 00:10:10,655
To speak with perfect candour, Cecily,

110
00:10:10,864 --> 00:10:15,415
I wish you were fully 42
and more than usually plain for your age.

111
00:10:19,144 --> 00:10:21,383
Ernest has a strong, upright nature.

112
00:10:21,384 --> 00:10:23,543
<i>He's the soul of truth and honour.</i>

113
00:10:23,544 --> 00:10:28,493
I think Jack, for instance. Jack.
Jack, for instance, a charming name.

114
00:10:28,704 --> 00:10:31,616
It is not Mr Ernest Worthing
who is my guardian.

115
00:10:31,824 --> 00:10:35,183
It is his brother, his elder brother.

116
00:10:35,184 --> 00:10:40,622
That accounts for it. You've lifted a load
from my mind. I was growing anxious.

117
00:10:42,504 --> 00:10:46,383
You're quite sure it's not Mr Ernest
Worthing who is your guardian?

118
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:49,423
Quite sure.

119
00:10:49,424 --> 00:10:54,544
In fact... I am going to be his.

120
00:10:56,784 --> 00:11:01,300
- I beg your pardon?
- Mr Ernest Worthing and I are engaged.

121
00:11:04,424 --> 00:11:08,053
My darling Cecily,
I think there must be some slight error.

122
00:11:08,264 --> 00:11:10,824
Mr Ernest Worthing is engaged to me.

123
00:11:11,024 --> 00:11:15,415
The announcement will appear
in "The Morning Post" on Saturday.

124
00:11:15,624 --> 00:11:20,175
You must be under some misconception.
Ernest proposed to me 10 minutes ago.

125
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:26,577
Very curious. For he asked me to be
his wife yesterday afternoon at 5.30.

126
00:11:26,784 --> 00:11:30,618
If you would care to verify the incident,
pray do so.

127
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:37,981
I never travel without my diary
so I have something sensational to read.

128
00:11:38,184 --> 00:11:42,541
I'm so sorry, dear Cecily,
but I'm afraid I have the prior claim.

129
00:12:13,344 --> 00:12:15,903
May I offer you some tea, Miss Fairfax?

130
00:12:15,904 --> 00:12:18,063
Thank you, Miss Cardew.

131
00:12:18,064 --> 00:12:19,338
Sugar?

132
00:12:19,544 --> 00:12:23,093
No, thank you.
Sugar is not fashionable any more.

133
00:12:40,144 --> 00:12:43,420
- Cake or bread and butter?
- Bread and butter, please.

134
00:12:43,624 --> 00:12:46,775
Cake is rarely seen
in the best houses nowadays.

135
00:13:00,384 --> 00:13:04,423
From the moment I saw you,
I felt you were false and deceitful.

136
00:13:05,464 --> 00:13:09,343
It seems to me that I am trespassing
on your valuable time.

137
00:13:09,544 --> 00:13:13,059
No doubt you have other calls
of a similar character to make.

138
00:13:14,984 --> 00:13:16,736
Ernest!

139
00:13:21,504 --> 00:13:23,863
- You're back so soon.
- My own love.

140
00:13:23,864 --> 00:13:28,142
May I ask, are you engaged
to be married to this young lady?

141
00:13:28,344 --> 00:13:30,703
What young lady?

142
00:13:30,704 --> 00:13:33,582
- Good heavens, Gwendolen!
- Yes, to good heavens Gwendolen.

143
00:13:33,784 --> 00:13:37,220
No. What put such an idea
into your pretty little head?

144
00:13:37,424 --> 00:13:40,780
- Thank you. You may.
- I thought there must be some error.

145
00:13:40,984 --> 00:13:45,933
The gentleman who is embracing you
is my cousin, Mr Algernon Moncrieff.

146
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:50,220
Algernon... Moncrieff?

147
00:13:50,424 --> 00:13:53,915
- Yes.
- Algy!

148
00:13:55,664 --> 00:13:58,343
Here is Ernest.

149
00:13:58,344 --> 00:14:02,019
- My own Ernest!
- Gwendolen, my darling!

150
00:14:02,224 --> 00:14:04,783
I knew there must be
some misunderstanding.

151
00:14:04,784 --> 00:14:09,778
The gentleman whose arm is round your
waist is my guardian, Mr John Worthing.

152
00:14:10,944 --> 00:14:14,016
- I beg your pardon?
- This is Uncle Jack.

153
00:14:15,144 --> 00:14:16,418
Jack?

154
00:14:21,024 --> 00:14:24,175
- Are you called Algy?
- I cannot deny it.

155
00:14:25,224 --> 00:14:28,383
Is your name really John?

156
00:14:28,384 --> 00:14:32,536
I could deny it if I liked,
but it certainly is John.

157
00:14:32,744 --> 00:14:36,293
- It has been for years.
- We have been grossly deceived.

158
00:14:36,504 --> 00:14:40,417
- My poor wounded Cecily.
- My sweet, wronged Gwendolen.

159
00:14:40,624 --> 00:14:44,014
- You will call me sister, will you not?
- Of course.

160
00:14:44,224 --> 00:14:48,183
Let us go into the house.
They won't venture to come after us.

161
00:14:48,384 --> 00:14:51,342
No. Men are so cowardly, aren't they?

162
00:14:56,904 --> 00:15:00,419
How you can calmly eat muffins,
I can't make out.

163
00:15:00,624 --> 00:15:02,943
You seem to be perfectly heartless.

164
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:06,493
I can hardly eat muffins
in an agitated manner, can I?

165
00:15:06,704 --> 00:15:11,858
- Butter would probably get on my cuffs.
- It's heartless your eating muffins at all!

166
00:15:12,064 --> 00:15:15,420
When I'm in trouble,
eating is my only consolation.

167
00:15:15,624 --> 00:15:21,972
When I'm in really great trouble,
I refuse everything except food and drink.

168
00:15:22,184 --> 00:15:25,893
At present, I am eating muffins
because I am unhappy.

169
00:15:26,104 --> 00:15:28,583
Besides, I'm particularly fond of muffins.

170
00:15:28,584 --> 00:15:32,736
There's no reason why you should
eat them all in that greedy way.

171
00:15:36,624 --> 00:15:39,582
Would you like some teacake?
I don't like teacake.

172
00:15:39,784 --> 00:15:43,743
A man may eat his own muffins
in his own garden!

173
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:47,783
They seem to be eating muffins.

174
00:15:47,784 --> 00:15:50,457
You said it was perfectly heartless
to eat muffins!

175
00:15:50,664 --> 00:15:55,419
I said it was perfectly heartless of you.
That is a very different thing.

176
00:15:55,624 --> 00:15:59,263
Maybe, but the muffins are the same!

177
00:15:59,264 --> 00:16:03,018
I certainly don't rate your chances
with my ward, Algernon!

178
00:16:03,224 --> 00:16:07,775
There isn't much likelihood of you and
Miss Fairfax being united, Jackety Jack!

179
00:16:23,744 --> 00:16:27,339
But is there any particular infant
in whom you are interested?

180
00:16:27,544 --> 00:16:30,934
The fact is, Doctor,
I would like to be christened myself.

181
00:16:32,704 --> 00:16:36,663
This afternoon,
if you have nothing better to do.

182
00:16:36,864 --> 00:16:40,300
Surely, Mr Worthing,
you've been christened already?

183
00:16:40,504 --> 00:16:43,177
I don't remember anything about it.

184
00:16:43,384 --> 00:16:48,697
I don't know if the thing would bother you
or if you think that I'm a little too old now.

185
00:16:48,904 --> 00:16:51,263
No, no. Not at all, not at all.

186
00:16:51,264 --> 00:16:54,813
The sprinkling,
and indeed immersion, of adults

187
00:16:55,024 --> 00:16:58,175
is a perfectly canonical practice.

188
00:16:59,304 --> 00:17:02,455
When would you wish the ceremony
to be performed?

189
00:17:02,664 --> 00:17:05,383
At about six if that would suit you.

190
00:17:05,584 --> 00:17:08,462
- Perfectly, perfectly.
- Thank you.

191
00:17:13,424 --> 00:17:18,259
- We cannot both be christened Ernest.
- I have a right to be christened if I like.

192
00:17:18,464 --> 00:17:21,058
- You've been christened already!
- Not for years!

193
00:17:21,264 --> 00:17:25,655
- But you have been christened.
- I know my constitution can stand it.

194
00:17:25,864 --> 00:17:31,302
If you've never been christened, it's
dangerous your venturing on it now.

195
00:17:31,504 --> 00:17:35,133
That is nonsense.
You're always talking nonsense.

196
00:17:56,664 --> 00:18:02,694
- Let us preserve a dignified silence.
- Certainly. It's the only thing to do now.

197
00:18:02,904 --> 00:18:10,379
<i>The western wind is blowing fair
Across the dark Aegean Sea</i>

198
00:18:10,584 --> 00:18:14,338
<i>And at the secret marble stair</i>

199
00:18:14,544 --> 00:18:17,934
<i>My Tyrian galley waits for thee</i>

200
00:18:18,144 --> 00:18:21,739
<i>Come down! The purple sail is spread</i>

201
00:18:21,944 --> 00:18:25,573
<i>The watchman sleeps within the town</i>

202
00:18:25,784 --> 00:18:28,344
This dignified silence
produces an unpleasant effect.

203
00:18:28,544 --> 00:18:30,303
Most distasteful.

204
00:18:30,304 --> 00:18:33,343
<i>Lady mine, come down</i>

205
00:18:33,344 --> 00:18:36,222
<i>Come down</i>

206
00:18:36,424 --> 00:18:38,938
<i>Lady, come down</i>

207
00:18:48,344 --> 00:18:52,303
<i>She will not come, I know her well</i>

208
00:18:52,504 --> 00:18:56,133
<i>Of lover's vows she hath no care</i>

209
00:18:56,344 --> 00:18:59,381
<i>A little good a man can tell</i>

210
00:19:00,184 --> 00:19:03,540
<i>Of one so cruel and so fair</i>

211
00:19:03,744 --> 00:19:07,703
<i>True love is but a woman's toy</i>

212
00:19:07,904 --> 00:19:11,374
<i>They never know the lover's pain</i>

213
00:19:11,584 --> 00:19:15,623
<i>And I who loved as loves a boy</i>

214
00:19:15,824 --> 00:19:19,100
<i>Must love in vain, must love in vain</i>

215
00:19:19,304 --> 00:19:22,362
<i>Come down</i>

216
00:19:22,624 --> 00:19:26,240
<i>Lady, come down</i>

217
00:19:26,904 --> 00:19:29,837
<i>Come down</i>

218
00:19:29,864 --> 00:19:33,320
<i>Lady, come down</i>

219
00:19:35,064 --> 00:19:38,022
- We will not be the first to speak.
- Certainly not.

220
00:19:38,224 --> 00:19:41,580
I have something to ask you.
Much depends on your reply.

221
00:19:41,784 --> 00:19:44,856
Your common sense is invaluable.

222
00:19:45,064 --> 00:19:50,297
Kindly answer me this question. Why did
you pretend to be my guardian's brother?

223
00:19:50,504 --> 00:19:52,823
In order that I might meet you.

224
00:19:52,824 --> 00:19:58,342
- That seems a satisfactory explanation.
- Yes, dear, if you can believe him.

225
00:19:58,544 --> 00:20:01,900
I don't, but that doesn't affect
the beauty of his answer.

226
00:20:02,104 --> 00:20:06,461
True. In matters of grave importance,
style, not sincerity, is the vital thing.

227
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:11,692
What explanation can you offer me
for pretending to have a brother?

228
00:20:16,104 --> 00:20:22,259
Was it in order that you might come up
to town to see me as often as possible?

229
00:20:22,464 --> 00:20:25,103
Can you doubt it, Miss Fairfax?

230
00:20:25,304 --> 00:20:29,820
I have the gravest doubts on the subject,
but I intend to crush them.

231
00:20:32,424 --> 00:20:35,177
Their explanations appear to be
quite satisfactory.

232
00:20:36,864 --> 00:20:40,140
Mr Worthing's seems to have
the stamp of truth upon it.

233
00:20:40,344 --> 00:20:42,983
I am content
with what Mr Moncrieff said.

234
00:20:42,984 --> 00:20:46,101
His voice alone seemed to inspire
absolute credulity.

235
00:20:46,304 --> 00:20:50,297
- Do you think we should forgive them?
- Yes...

236
00:20:50,504 --> 00:20:53,143
- I mean, no.
- There are principles at stake

237
00:20:53,344 --> 00:20:56,800
that one cannot surrender!

238
00:21:04,864 --> 00:21:08,618
Your Christian names are still
an insuperable barrier. That is all.

239
00:21:08,824 --> 00:21:11,023
- Our Christian names?
- Is that all?

240
00:21:11,024 --> 00:21:13,503
We're going to be christened
this afternoon.

241
00:21:13,504 --> 00:21:17,292
- You're prepared to do this terrible thing?
- I am.

242
00:21:17,504 --> 00:21:20,382
You're ready to face this fearful ordeal?

243
00:21:20,584 --> 00:21:24,133
On questions of self-sacrifice,
men are infinitely beyond us!

244
00:21:24,344 --> 00:21:27,461
- We are.
- Darling!

245
00:21:30,184 --> 00:21:32,903
- Lady Bracknell.
- Gwendolen!

246
00:21:33,104 --> 00:21:35,463
What does this mean?

247
00:21:35,464 --> 00:21:39,059
Merely that I am engaged to be married
to Mr Worthing, Mama.

248
00:21:39,264 --> 00:21:41,824
Come here. Sit down.

249
00:21:43,704 --> 00:21:46,956
Sit down immediately!

250
00:21:51,944 --> 00:21:57,064
All communication between yourself
and my daughter must cease at once.

251
00:21:57,264 --> 00:21:59,778
On this point, I am firm.

252
00:21:59,984 --> 00:22:05,058
- I'm engaged to Gwendolen.
- You are nothing of the kind, sir.

253
00:22:08,184 --> 00:22:10,937
And now, as regards Algy.

254
00:22:14,144 --> 00:22:17,261
- Algy...
- Yes, Aunt Augusta.

255
00:22:17,464 --> 00:22:20,900
Is it here that your invalid friend
Mr Bunbury resides?

256
00:22:21,104 --> 00:22:25,063
No, Bunbury doesn't live here.
Bunbury's somewhere else at present.

257
00:22:25,264 --> 00:22:29,780
In fact... Bunbury is dead.

258
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:33,738
- Dead?
- Dead.

259
00:22:34,624 --> 00:22:37,934
When did he die?
His death must have been sudden.

260
00:22:38,144 --> 00:22:40,583
He died this afternoon.

261
00:22:40,584 --> 00:22:43,542
- What did he die of?
- Bunbury?

262
00:22:44,584 --> 00:22:47,257
- He was quite exploded.
- Exploded?

263
00:22:50,544 --> 00:22:53,103
Was he the victim
of a revolutionary outrage?

264
00:22:53,104 --> 00:22:56,016
I was not aware
he was interested in social legislation.

265
00:22:56,224 --> 00:22:59,819
My dear Aunt Augusta,
I mean he was found out.

266
00:23:00,024 --> 00:23:04,893
The doctors found out that Bunbury
could not live, so Bunbury died.

267
00:23:06,744 --> 00:23:10,100
He had great confidence
in the opinion of his physicians.

268
00:23:10,304 --> 00:23:14,263
I'm glad he made up his mind
to some definite course of action

269
00:23:14,464 --> 00:23:16,623
and acted under proper medical advice.

270
00:23:16,624 --> 00:23:20,902
And now that we have finally
got rid of this Mr Bunbury,

271
00:23:21,104 --> 00:23:25,859
may I ask, who is that young person
who's hand Algernon is now holding

272
00:23:26,064 --> 00:23:30,137
in what seems to me to be
a peculiarly unnecessary manner?

273
00:23:30,344 --> 00:23:35,623
- She is Miss Cecily Cardew, my ward.
- I am engaged to be married to Cecily.

274
00:23:35,824 --> 00:23:39,339
- I beg your pardon?
- Mr Moncrieff and I are engaged.

275
00:23:40,184 --> 00:23:45,542
I do not know if there is anything peculiar
about the air in this part of Hertfordshire,

276
00:23:45,744 --> 00:23:50,101
but the number of engagements seem
to be considerably above the average

277
00:23:50,304 --> 00:23:53,740
that statistics have laid down
for our guidance.

278
00:23:53,944 --> 00:23:59,621
Is Miss Cardew connected with any of
the larger railway stations in London?

279
00:24:00,864 --> 00:24:03,537
I merely desire information.

280
00:24:03,744 --> 00:24:09,057
Until recently, I was not aware there were
anyone whose origin was a terminus.

281
00:24:11,904 --> 00:24:15,453
Gwendolen, the time approaches
for our departure.

282
00:24:15,664 --> 00:24:18,701
I'd better ask if Miss Cardew
has any fortune.

283
00:24:18,904 --> 00:24:25,013
<i>About £130,000 in the funds, that is all.
Goodbye. So pleased to have seen you.</i>

284
00:24:25,224 --> 00:24:28,383
A moment, Mr Worthing.

285
00:24:28,384 --> 00:24:34,539
<i>£130,000... and in the funds?</i>

286
00:24:37,984 --> 00:24:42,933
Miss Cardew seems to me to be a most
attractive young lady now I look at her.

287
00:24:43,144 --> 00:24:46,794
Come over here, dear.

288
00:24:48,304 --> 00:24:50,864
The chin a little higher dear.

289
00:24:51,064 --> 00:24:56,616
Style largely depends on the way the chin
is worn. They are worn high at present.

290
00:24:56,824 --> 00:25:01,420
Algy, there are distinct social possibilities
in Miss Cardew's profile.

291
00:25:01,624 --> 00:25:06,778
Cecily is the sweetest, dearest girl. I don't
give tuppence for her social possibilities.

292
00:25:06,984 --> 00:25:12,741
Never speak disrespectfully of society.
Only people who can't get into it do that.

293
00:25:14,264 --> 00:25:18,542
You know that Algy has nothing
but his debts to depend upon.

294
00:25:18,744 --> 00:25:22,703
I do not approve of mercenary marriages.

295
00:25:22,904 --> 00:25:27,853
Indeed, when I married Lord Bracknell,
I had no fortune of any kind.

296
00:25:38,504 --> 00:25:43,453
<i>But I never dreamed for a moment
of allowing that to stand in my way.</i>

297
00:25:47,544 --> 00:25:51,173
- I suppose I must give my consent.
- Thank you, Aunt Augusta.

298
00:25:51,384 --> 00:25:55,343
I beg your pardon for interrupting,
but I am Miss Cardew's guardian.

299
00:25:55,544 --> 00:26:01,460
She can't marry without my consent until
she comes of age and I decline to give it.

300
00:26:01,664 --> 00:26:04,258
Upon what grounds, may I ask?

301
00:26:04,464 --> 00:26:07,342
I suspect him of being untruthful.

302
00:26:07,544 --> 00:26:11,014
Untruthful? My nephew Algy?

303
00:26:11,224 --> 00:26:14,978
I fear there can be no possible doubt
about the matter.

304
00:26:18,464 --> 00:26:24,300
During my temporary absence in London
on an important question of romance,

305
00:26:24,504 --> 00:26:29,294
he obtained admission to my house
by the pretence of being my brother.

306
00:26:31,064 --> 00:26:35,774
He won over the affections of my ward,
and his intentions were purely financial.

307
00:26:35,984 --> 00:26:38,543
Deny it if you dare!

308
00:26:38,544 --> 00:26:43,334
He subsequently stayed to tea
and devoured every single muffin.

309
00:26:43,544 --> 00:26:45,703
What makes his behaviour
even more heartless

310
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:51,654
is that he was aware I have no brother
and I don't intend to have a brother.

311
00:26:51,864 --> 00:26:55,798
- Please!
- Come here, sweet child.

312
00:26:56,984 --> 00:26:59,544
- How old are you, dear?
- 18, Aunt Augusta.

313
00:26:59,744 --> 00:27:06,092
It will not be long before you are of age,
free from the restraints of your guardian.

314
00:27:06,304 --> 00:27:09,023
According to the terms
of her grandfather's will,

315
00:27:09,224 --> 00:27:12,580
she does not come legally of age
until she is 35.

316
00:27:12,784 --> 00:27:15,821
That does not seem to be
a grave objection.

317
00:27:16,024 --> 00:27:18,183
35 is a very attractive age.

318
00:27:18,184 --> 00:27:21,221
London society is full of women
of the highest birth

319
00:27:21,424 --> 00:27:25,178
who have, of their own free choice,
remained 35 for years.

320
00:27:26,024 --> 00:27:29,983
- Could you wait for me till I was 35?
- You know I could.

321
00:27:30,184 --> 00:27:33,460
I felt it instinctively,
but I couldn't wait all that time.

322
00:27:33,664 --> 00:27:38,055
- What is to be done, Cecily?
- I don't know, Mr Moncrieff.

323
00:27:40,384 --> 00:27:44,662
My dear Mr Worthing,
as Miss Cardew states quite positively

324
00:27:44,864 --> 00:27:47,424
that she cannot wait until she is 35,

325
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:51,776
a remark which, I am bound to say,
shows a somewhat impatient nature,

326
00:27:51,984 --> 00:27:55,659
I beg you to reconsider your decision.

327
00:27:55,864 --> 00:28:01,575
My dear Lady Bracknell, the moment you
consent to my marriage with Gwendolen,

328
00:28:01,784 --> 00:28:04,981
your nephew can form an alliance
with my ward.

329
00:28:07,664 --> 00:28:12,101
You must be aware that
what you propose is out of the question.

330
00:28:12,304 --> 00:28:16,217
Then a passionate celibacy
is all any of us can look forward to.

331
00:28:17,144 --> 00:28:20,102
Come, dear.
We've missed five, if not six trains.

332
00:28:20,304 --> 00:28:23,853
To miss more might expose us
to comment on the platform.

333
00:28:24,064 --> 00:28:26,897
Everything is quite ready
for the christenings.

334
00:28:27,104 --> 00:28:30,813
The christenings, sir?
Is not that somewhat premature?

335
00:28:31,024 --> 00:28:35,575
Both of these gentlemen have expressed
a desire for immediate baptism.

336
00:28:35,784 --> 00:28:39,493
At their age?
The idea is grotesque and irreligious.

337
00:28:39,704 --> 00:28:43,856
Algy, I forbid you to be baptised.
I will not hear of such excesses.

338
00:28:46,904 --> 00:28:51,022
- I'm sorry to interrupt, Dr Chasuble.
- Yes, yes?

339
00:28:55,624 --> 00:29:00,061
Miss Prism has asked me to tell you
she's waiting for you in the vestry.

340
00:29:00,264 --> 00:29:03,903
She's been waiting for some time.

341
00:29:03,904 --> 00:29:07,533
Miss Prism... in the vestry.

342
00:29:07,744 --> 00:29:10,941
Waiting for you, yes.

343
00:29:11,144 --> 00:29:13,863
Miss Prism?

344
00:29:13,864 --> 00:29:17,300
- Did I hear you mention a Miss Prism?
- Yes, madam...

345
00:29:21,104 --> 00:29:24,574
- Bless you.
- Yes, I'm on my way to join her.

346
00:29:24,784 --> 00:29:29,175
Is she a female of repellent aspect
remotely connected with education?

347
00:29:29,384 --> 00:29:35,016
She is the most cultivated of ladies
and the picture of respectability.

348
00:29:35,184 --> 00:29:40,304
It is obviously the same person.
Take me to the vestry at once.

349
00:29:48,744 --> 00:29:51,497
I've been expecting you, dear Doctor.

350
00:29:54,104 --> 00:29:56,060
Prism!

351
00:30:01,344 --> 00:30:03,175
Prism.

352
00:30:10,744 --> 00:30:13,133
Prism!

353
00:30:16,984 --> 00:30:19,544
Where is that baby?

354
00:30:35,824 --> 00:30:40,102
34 years ago, you left Lord Bracknell's
house - 104 Upper Grosvenor Street -

355
00:30:40,304 --> 00:30:44,855
in charge of a perambulator that
contained a baby of the male sex.

356
00:30:46,744 --> 00:30:48,703
You never returned.

357
00:30:48,704 --> 00:30:53,255
A few weeks later, through the elaborate
investigations of the Metropolitan Police,

358
00:30:53,464 --> 00:30:56,023
<i>the perambulator was discovered
at midnight</i>

359
00:30:56,024 --> 00:30:59,380
<i>standing by itself
in a remote corner of Bayswater.</i>

360
00:31:00,424 --> 00:31:03,177
<i>It contained the manuscript
of a three-volume novel</i>

361
00:31:03,384 --> 00:31:07,138
<i>of more than usually revolting
sentimentality.</i>

362
00:31:08,664 --> 00:31:11,223
<i>But the baby was not there.</i>

363
00:31:11,224 --> 00:31:14,543
Prism, where is that baby?

364
00:31:14,544 --> 00:31:18,822
Lady Bracknell, I admit with shame
that I do not know.

365
00:31:20,344 --> 00:31:22,703
The facts of the case are these.

366
00:31:22,704 --> 00:31:27,653
On the morning of the day in question,
a day for ever branded on my memory,

367
00:31:27,864 --> 00:31:32,062
I prepared, as usual, to take the baby
out in its perambulator.

368
00:31:32,264 --> 00:31:37,941
I had also with me a somewhat old,
but capacious handbag,

369
00:31:38,144 --> 00:31:41,420
in which I had intended to place
a work of fiction

370
00:31:41,624 --> 00:31:46,061
that I had written
during my few unoccupied hours.

371
00:31:47,104 --> 00:31:53,054
In a moment of mental abstraction,
for which I never can forgive myself,

372
00:31:53,264 --> 00:31:56,017
I deposited the manuscript
in the bassinet

373
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:03,020
and placed the baby in the handbag.

374
00:32:16,424 --> 00:32:19,880
Where did you deposit the handbag?

375
00:32:19,904 --> 00:32:24,580
- Do not ask me, Mr Worthing.
- This is a matter of importance to me.

376
00:32:24,784 --> 00:32:30,142
I insist on knowing where you deposited
the handbag that contained that infant.

377
00:32:30,344 --> 00:32:34,735
I left it in the cloakroom of one of
London's larger railway stations.

378
00:32:34,944 --> 00:32:41,213
- What railway station?
- Victoria. The Brighton Line.

379
00:32:55,424 --> 00:32:59,313
Uncle Jack seems strangely agitated.

380
00:33:05,824 --> 00:33:09,679
Is this the handbag, Miss Prism?

381
00:33:14,064 --> 00:33:16,223
Examine it carefully before you speak.

382
00:33:16,224 --> 00:33:19,773
The happiness of more than one life
depends on your answer.

383
00:33:19,984 --> 00:33:25,854
That is undoubtedly mine. I am delighted
to have it so unexpectedly restored to me.

384
00:33:26,064 --> 00:33:29,579
It has been a great inconvenience
being without it.

385
00:33:29,784 --> 00:33:34,221
More is restored to you
than this handbag. I was the baby.

386
00:33:36,184 --> 00:33:37,742
You?

387
00:33:38,744 --> 00:33:42,817
- Mother!
- Mr Worthing, I am unmarried.

388
00:33:43,024 --> 00:33:47,176
Unmarried? I cannot deny
that is a serious blow.

389
00:33:47,384 --> 00:33:51,536
But who has the right to cast a stone
against one who has suffered?

390
00:33:51,744 --> 00:33:55,532
Cannot repentance wipe out
an act of folly?

391
00:33:55,744 --> 00:33:59,498
- I forgive you!
- No, Mr Worthing, there is some error.

392
00:34:00,784 --> 00:34:04,743
There is the lady who can tell you
who you really are.

393
00:34:08,784 --> 00:34:14,700
Lady Bracknell, I hate to seem inquisitive,
but would you inform me who I am?

394
00:34:14,904 --> 00:34:18,055
You are the son of my poor sister,
Mrs Moncrieff,

395
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:21,700
and, consequently,
Algy's younger brother.

396
00:34:27,664 --> 00:34:31,120
Algy's younger brother?

397
00:34:54,464 --> 00:34:57,615
So I have a brother, after all.

398
00:34:59,624 --> 00:35:00,898
Yes.

399
00:35:06,864 --> 00:35:10,320
I knew I had a brother!

400
00:35:10,904 --> 00:35:13,063
I always said I had a brother.

401
00:35:13,064 --> 00:35:16,022
How could you ever have doubted
I had a brother?

402
00:35:16,224 --> 00:35:18,943
Dr Chasuble, my unfortunate brother.

403
00:35:19,144 --> 00:35:21,783
Miss Prism, my unfortunate brother.

404
00:35:21,784 --> 00:35:24,423
Gwendolen, my unfortunate brother.

405
00:35:24,424 --> 00:35:28,074
Lady Bracknell, my brother!

406
00:35:44,184 --> 00:35:49,338
Under these strange and unforeseen
circumstances, Mr Moncrieff,

407
00:35:49,544 --> 00:35:53,319
you may kiss your Aunt Augusta.

408
00:36:03,384 --> 00:36:06,543
Mr Moncrieff...

409
00:36:06,544 --> 00:36:08,703
...after all that has occurred

410
00:36:08,704 --> 00:36:13,061
and any inconvenience I may have
caused you in your infancy,

411
00:36:13,264 --> 00:36:16,620
it is my duty to resign my position
in this household.

412
00:36:16,824 --> 00:36:19,503
That is absurd. I won't hear of it.

413
00:36:19,504 --> 00:36:23,053
Sir, it is my duty to leave.

414
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:27,098
I have really nothing more
to teach dear Cecily.

415
00:36:27,304 --> 00:36:30,933
In the very difficult accomplishment
of getting married,

416
00:36:31,144 --> 00:36:35,934
I fear my sweet and clever pupil
has far outstripped her teacher.

417
00:36:55,184 --> 00:36:58,800
A moment, Miss Prism.

418
00:37:00,864 --> 00:37:02,623
Dr Chasuble.

419
00:37:02,624 --> 00:37:05,980
I have come to the conclusion
that the Primitive Church

420
00:37:06,184 --> 00:37:10,143
is in error on certain points
on the question of matrimony.

421
00:37:11,864 --> 00:37:15,493
Corrupt readings seem to have
crept into the text.

422
00:37:16,344 --> 00:37:19,017
In consequence...

423
00:37:19,224 --> 00:37:24,344
...I beg to solicit the honour of your hand.

424
00:37:25,464 --> 00:37:29,298
- Frederick!
- Laetitia!

425
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:33,583
- My dear Cecily!
- My dearest Algernon!

426
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:36,735
- My own Gwendolen.
- My own... But wait, who are you?

427
00:37:36,944 --> 00:37:41,893
I mean, what is your Christian name
now you have become someone else?

428
00:37:42,104 --> 00:37:46,620
I'd forgotten that point. The question
had better be cleared up at once.

429
00:37:46,824 --> 00:37:52,262
At the time when Miss Prism left me
in the handbag, had I been christened?

430
00:37:52,464 --> 00:37:55,103
I think you were christened
after your father.

431
00:37:55,304 --> 00:37:57,943
What was my father's Christian name?

432
00:37:58,144 --> 00:38:03,172
I cannot now recall what the General's
name was. I've no doubt he had one.

433
00:38:03,384 --> 00:38:05,943
Can't you recollect what his name was?

434
00:38:05,944 --> 00:38:09,493
We were hardly on speaking terms.
He died when I was three.

435
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:12,821
His name would appear on the army lists.

436
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:17,973
The General was a man of peace,
except in his domestic life.

437
00:38:18,184 --> 00:38:20,982
But his name would appear
on any military directory.

438
00:38:24,624 --> 00:38:29,459
Army lists of the last 40 years are here.
They should've been my constant study.

439
00:38:29,664 --> 00:38:33,816
Lieutenants... captains... colonels...

440
00:38:35,184 --> 00:38:37,744
...colonels... generals!

441
00:38:37,944 --> 00:38:39,536
M.

442
00:38:39,744 --> 00:38:42,338
Maxbolm, Magley,

443
00:38:42,544 --> 00:38:45,217
Markby, Migsby, Mobbs, Moncrieff!

444
00:38:45,424 --> 00:38:48,097
Lieutenant, 1860. Christian names.

445
00:39:03,144 --> 00:39:08,172
I always told you, Gwendolen,
that my name was Ernest, didn't I?

446
00:39:10,944 --> 00:39:13,902
Well, it is Ernest, after all.

447
00:39:16,784 --> 00:39:19,903
It naturally is Ernest.

448
00:39:19,904 --> 00:39:24,659
My own Ernest, I felt from the first
that you could have no other name.

449
00:40:02,104 --> 00:40:04,583
My nephew...

450
00:40:04,584 --> 00:40:07,735
...you seem to be displaying signs
of triviality.

451
00:40:07,944 --> 00:40:10,303
On the contrary, Aunt Augusta,

452
00:40:10,304 --> 00:40:14,297
I've realised for the first time
the vital importance of being earnest.

453
00:40:49,104 --> 00:40:52,733
<i>The western wind is blowing fair</i>

454
00:40:52,944 --> 00:40:56,619
<i>Across the dark Aegean Sea</i>

455
00:40:56,824 --> 00:41:00,339
<i>And at the secret marble stair</i>

456
00:41:00,544 --> 00:41:03,980
<i>My Tyrian galley waits for thee</i>

457
00:41:04,184 --> 00:41:07,972
<i>Come down! The purple sail is spread</i>

458
00:41:08,184 --> 00:41:11,972
<i>The watchman sleeps within the town</i>

459
00:41:12,184 --> 00:41:15,699
<i>Leave thy lily-flowered bed</i>

460
00:41:15,904 --> 00:41:19,294
<i>O lady mine, come down</i>

461
00:41:19,504 --> 00:41:22,703
<i>Come down</i>

462
00:41:22,704 --> 00:41:25,457
<i>Lady, come down</i>

463
00:41:27,064 --> 00:41:30,343
<i>Come down</i>

464
00:41:30,344 --> 00:41:34,098
<i>Lady, come down</i>

465
00:41:34,304 --> 00:41:38,159
<i>O, lady, come down</i>

466
00:41:39,064 --> 00:41:42,613
<i>She will not come, I know her well</i>

467
00:41:42,824 --> 00:41:46,373
<i>Of lover's vows she hath no care</i>

468
00:41:46,584 --> 00:41:50,259
<i>A little good a man can tell</i>

469
00:41:50,464 --> 00:41:53,979
<i>Of one so cruel and so fair</i>

470
00:41:54,184 --> 00:41:57,859
<i>True love is but a woman's toy</i>

471
00:41:58,064 --> 00:42:01,818
<i>They never know the lover's pain</i>

472
00:42:02,024 --> 00:42:05,573
<i>And I who loved as loves a boy</i>

473
00:42:05,784 --> 00:42:09,220
<i>Must love in vain, must love in vain</i>

474
00:42:09,424 --> 00:42:12,676
<i>Come down</i>

475
00:42:12,744 --> 00:42:15,304
<i>Lady, come down</i>

476
00:42:16,864 --> 00:42:20,303
<i>Come down</i>

477
00:42:20,304 --> 00:42:22,864
<i>Lady, come down</i>

478
00:42:24,984 --> 00:42:28,943
I think your high notes
may have damaged our chances.

479
00:42:29,144 --> 00:42:33,262
- You're completely out of tune!
- How dare you!

480
00:42:33,464 --> 00:42:36,023
- I'll take this bit.
- Leave this to me!

481
00:42:36,024 --> 00:42:38,663
- I'll take this bit.
- I'm coming through!

482
00:42:38,664 --> 00:42:45,012
<i>- Go easy, my dear fellow.
- Come down! Come down!</i>

483
00:42:45,224 --> 00:42:49,183
<i>- Lady, come down
- Overdoing it. Less is more.</i>

484
00:42:49,384 --> 00:42:52,899
<i>Come down</i>

485
00:42:53,104 --> 00:42:55,664
<i>Lady, come down</i>

486
00:43:00,904 --> 00:43:04,360
That wasn't so bad, was it?

487
00:43:05,984 --> 00:43:09,943
Maybe they're not going to come down.
Maybe we should go up.

488
00:43:10,144 --> 00:43:14,422
- Algy, you're always talking nonsense.
- Well, it's better than listening to it.

489
00:43:14,624 --> 00:43:20,972
<i>Lady, come down</i>

490
00:44:24,184 --> 00:44:27,176
Did you hear what
I was playing, Lane?

491
00:44:27,384 --> 00:44:29,898
I didn't think it polite to listen, sir.

492
00:44:30,898 --> 00:44:40,898
