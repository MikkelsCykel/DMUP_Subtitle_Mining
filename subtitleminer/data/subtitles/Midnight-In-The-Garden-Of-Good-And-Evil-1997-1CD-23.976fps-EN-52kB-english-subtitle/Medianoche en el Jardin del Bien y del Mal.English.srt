1
00:01:58,095 --> 00:02:00,370
Quit eyeballing me, Flavius.

2
00:02:00,615 --> 00:02:03,687
I knew you when you was
a two-bit hustler on Bull Street.

3
00:02:48,895 --> 00:02:51,045
Excuse me!
Where can a fella get a cab?

4
00:02:51,295 --> 00:02:52,284
He just left.

5
00:02:52,535 --> 00:02:55,049
You can call the company, but I's you,
I'd wait on him to come back.

6
00:02:55,295 --> 00:02:56,933
'Less you want to take a ride.

7
00:02:57,175 --> 00:02:59,052
- You going to Jones Street?
- I'll get you there.

8
00:02:59,775 --> 00:03:01,049
Put your stuff in there.

9
00:03:06,055 --> 00:03:08,410
<i>To your right, Pirate's House...</i>

10
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:10,930
<i>... built in 1794.</i>

11
00:03:11,175 --> 00:03:14,963
<i>All the ne'er-do-wells and scalawags</i>
<i>divided up their booty there.</i>

12
00:03:16,695 --> 00:03:18,890
<i>Sherman stayed</i>
<i>in the Green-Meldrim House...</i>

13
00:03:19,135 --> 00:03:21,933
<i>... to rest up</i>
<i>after his fiery march through Atlanta.</i>

14
00:03:22,175 --> 00:03:23,813
<i>He was going to burn Savannah...</i>

15
00:03:24,055 --> 00:03:27,047
<i>... but the locals drowned him</i>
<i>in Chatham Artillery punch...</i>

16
00:03:27,295 --> 00:03:29,604
<i>... and fancy parties</i>
<i>till he decided...</i>

17
00:03:29,855 --> 00:03:31,686
<i>... to spare our fair city.</i>

18
00:03:31,935 --> 00:03:34,165
<i>Forsyth Park, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

19
00:03:58,935 --> 00:04:00,368
You looking for something?

20
00:04:02,255 --> 00:04:03,210
No.

21
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:27,130
Mr. Kelso?

22
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:29,206
Are you Mr. Kelso?

23
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:32,811
I'm Lorene Baxter.
Welcome to Savannah.

24
00:04:33,535 --> 00:04:36,732
<i>Town & Country</i>
is my favorite magazine.

25
00:04:37,255 --> 00:04:41,009
Oh, my land, where are my manners?
What can I get you to drink?

26
00:04:41,975 --> 00:04:43,693
Anything cold would be great.

27
00:04:49,735 --> 00:04:51,885
Mr. Williams restored this home.

28
00:04:52,135 --> 00:04:54,933
One of the many he saved
from the wrecking ball.

29
00:04:57,415 --> 00:05:00,134
The carriage house is reserved
for Jim's clients...

30
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:02,809
...and guests, such as yourself.

31
00:05:13,095 --> 00:05:14,289
He's here.

32
00:05:17,095 --> 00:05:19,404
Welcome, Mr. Kelsy.

33
00:05:19,735 --> 00:05:22,488
- I'm sorry, Mr. Kelso?
- John Kelso.

34
00:05:22,735 --> 00:05:24,566
Yes. I'm Betty Harty.

35
00:05:24,815 --> 00:05:26,328
Sonny's been expecting you.

36
00:05:26,575 --> 00:05:28,486
I'm here to see Jim Williams.

37
00:05:28,735 --> 00:05:30,612
Sonny's Jim's attorney.

38
00:05:34,895 --> 00:05:36,169
Well, hell...

39
00:05:36,415 --> 00:05:37,734
...come on in, coach.

40
00:05:38,335 --> 00:05:39,290
John Kelso.

41
00:05:40,415 --> 00:05:43,452
Welcome to the old curiosity shop.
Take a seat.

42
00:05:51,815 --> 00:05:53,726
You let me know.

43
00:05:56,655 --> 00:05:58,850
- How was your trip?
- Fine. Mr. Williams said...

44
00:05:59,095 --> 00:06:03,054
He will be right along. We have
a little business to attend to first.

45
00:06:03,295 --> 00:06:06,765
Confidentiality agreement.
Just boilerplate stuff.

46
00:06:07,015 --> 00:06:08,334
Plus a paragraph...

47
00:06:08,615 --> 00:06:11,493
...outlining Jim's editorial privileges.

48
00:06:12,935 --> 00:06:17,087
<i>Town & Country</i> flew me down to write
a 500-word story on a Christmas party.

49
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:19,929
It's a literary postcard.
Are you serious about this?

50
00:06:20,495 --> 00:06:22,167
It's not just any party.

51
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:25,688
Have you asked the magazine?

52
00:06:25,935 --> 00:06:28,768
I'd rather have your word
than some New York lawyer.

53
00:06:30,495 --> 00:06:32,213
Be that as it may...

54
00:06:33,015 --> 00:06:34,733
...I'm not going to sign that.

55
00:06:35,935 --> 00:06:37,573
Damn! How come?

56
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:40,246
It's just a little old party write-up.

57
00:06:40,695 --> 00:06:42,811
All the more reason
not to compromise my ethics.

58
00:06:43,055 --> 00:06:45,853
As a professional,
I'm sure you understand.

59
00:06:50,895 --> 00:06:52,294
Promise to be fair?

60
00:06:52,815 --> 00:06:54,533
Yes, of course.

61
00:07:02,735 --> 00:07:03,645
Jim...

62
00:07:05,135 --> 00:07:06,853
...this is John Kelso.

63
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,170
Hello.

64
00:07:09,855 --> 00:07:11,925
Let's take a walk,
shall we, sport?

65
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:18,085
We'll go around Forsyth Park.

66
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:30,649
Would y'all mind...?

67
00:07:30,895 --> 00:07:32,533
Not at all, Betty.

68
00:07:33,575 --> 00:07:34,530
Come on.

69
00:07:41,775 --> 00:07:43,333
Did you sign Sonny's papers?

70
00:07:43,655 --> 00:07:44,770
Actually, no.

71
00:07:45,935 --> 00:07:49,894
Good for you. Sonny's
overly protective of my interests.

72
00:07:50,495 --> 00:07:52,645
- Still walking the dog, Mr. Glover?
- Yes, sir.

73
00:07:52,895 --> 00:07:55,250
Patrick do love his morning walk.

74
00:08:00,775 --> 00:08:03,847
Would you mind? Could I please have
my picture made with Uga?

75
00:08:04,255 --> 00:08:05,210
Great.

76
00:08:05,495 --> 00:08:06,530
Thanks.

77
00:08:08,335 --> 00:08:10,007
All right. Smile.

78
00:08:12,215 --> 00:08:13,933
Thanks. Dang good dog.

79
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,405
Thank you very much.

80
00:08:16,695 --> 00:08:17,923
Thank you for asking.

81
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:22,333
No matter what you and I ever do
in our lives, Mr. Kelso...

82
00:08:22,615 --> 00:08:24,731
...neither of us
will be as famous as Uga.

83
00:08:25,535 --> 00:08:26,604
He's the university mascot.

84
00:08:26,855 --> 00:08:28,686
- "The Georgia Bulldog."
- Is that right?

85
00:08:29,015 --> 00:08:32,928
I know I'm going to regret asking,
but that man said he was walking a dog.

86
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,850
What dog?

87
00:08:36,135 --> 00:08:38,285
Mr. Glover was the law firm porter.

88
00:08:38,735 --> 00:08:42,853
Mr. Bouhan said in his will that
Mr. Glover should continue to be paid...

89
00:08:43,135 --> 00:08:46,252
...$ 15 every week for walking Patrick,
his Labrador.

90
00:08:46,575 --> 00:08:47,610
So...

91
00:08:48,455 --> 00:08:49,444
...where's Patrick?

92
00:08:49,735 --> 00:08:54,365
Patrick went on to his great rewards
2 years after Mr. Bouhan, about 1974.

93
00:08:54,655 --> 00:08:56,532
- The dog's dead.
- Quite.

94
00:08:57,615 --> 00:08:59,765
Why doesn't Mr. Glover walk Uga?

95
00:09:02,735 --> 00:09:04,612
Well, then, who'd walk Patrick?

96
00:09:08,295 --> 00:09:09,694
I see.

97
00:09:12,215 --> 00:09:14,171
- There it is.
- This is your house?

98
00:09:14,975 --> 00:09:18,934
Built by General Hugh Mercer in 1860,
but he never lived in this house.

99
00:09:19,215 --> 00:09:21,171
His great-grandson was Johnny Mercer.

100
00:09:21,455 --> 00:09:22,524
The songwriter?

101
00:09:22,815 --> 00:09:24,043
Savannah's own.

102
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:26,686
What's your favorite of his tunes?

103
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:30,253
My mother was always partial
to "Fools Rush In."

104
00:09:30,655 --> 00:09:31,804
Your mother.

105
00:09:32,615 --> 00:09:33,491
Indeed.

106
00:09:33,895 --> 00:09:38,685
I'd love to give you the grand tour, but
they're still setting up for the party.

107
00:09:39,615 --> 00:09:41,446
I thought the party was tomorrow night.

108
00:09:41,735 --> 00:09:43,214
There are two parties.

109
00:09:43,455 --> 00:09:46,413
Tonight is for bachelors.
Gentlemen only.

110
00:09:47,575 --> 00:09:48,690
Would you like to come?

111
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:50,890
I'd like to cover it.

112
00:09:51,135 --> 00:09:54,286
I'm sorry. It's private.
Reporters aren't allowed.

113
00:09:54,535 --> 00:09:57,527
Would you like to see my shop?
It's back here in the carriage house.

114
00:10:00,015 --> 00:10:04,691
This house is one of the largest
in Savannah. It covers an entire block.

115
00:10:04,975 --> 00:10:06,328
It's right in here.

116
00:10:06,615 --> 00:10:08,446
This is where we do all of our...

117
00:10:08,695 --> 00:10:10,174
...restorations.

118
00:10:21,735 --> 00:10:23,566
This landscape, is it a Stubbs?

119
00:10:24,255 --> 00:10:25,404
Very good.

120
00:10:26,015 --> 00:10:27,448
My father was a dealer.

121
00:10:27,695 --> 00:10:30,732
It's called <i>Newmarket Heath</i>
<i>with a Rubbing-Down House.</i>

122
00:10:30,975 --> 00:10:33,648
It's a recent purchase I will unveil
at tomorrow night's event.

123
00:10:34,055 --> 00:10:35,568
It's an odd piece.

124
00:10:36,175 --> 00:10:37,893
The impasto is interesting.

125
00:10:38,935 --> 00:10:40,004
Where's your black light?

126
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:50,770
It's an overpaint.

127
00:10:51,575 --> 00:10:53,247
Very good, sport.

128
00:10:57,575 --> 00:10:59,566
- You had it x-rayed yet?
- No.

129
00:11:00,495 --> 00:11:02,247
How will you know
what it's obscuring?

130
00:11:04,055 --> 00:11:05,886
I rather enjoy not knowing.

131
00:12:02,015 --> 00:12:03,209
Just a minute.

132
00:12:11,055 --> 00:12:12,693
- Who is it?
- Mandy.

133
00:12:12,975 --> 00:12:13,851
Who?

134
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:16,884
I don't know a Mandy.

135
00:12:17,135 --> 00:12:19,603
Of course not.
You won't open the damn door.

136
00:12:21,295 --> 00:12:23,172
Hi. Nice to meet you.

137
00:12:31,655 --> 00:12:33,566
You all got some ice?

138
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:37,174
Sure, help yourself.

139
00:12:37,655 --> 00:12:40,727
Joe Odom's fridge is on the blink.
And plus, at present...

140
00:12:40,975 --> 00:12:43,045
...we don't have electricity.

141
00:12:44,975 --> 00:12:46,249
Thirsty?

142
00:12:47,295 --> 00:12:49,445
Me? No.
No, not really.

143
00:12:51,215 --> 00:12:55,208
If you're thirsty, a drink'll cure it.
If you're not, a drink'll prevent it.

144
00:12:55,495 --> 00:12:57,804
Prevention is better than a cure.

145
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:02,611
Put on some pants, John Kelso.

146
00:13:05,135 --> 00:13:06,648
Sure, just let me get a pair.

147
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,333
This is our newest addition
to the Odom House.

148
00:13:12,655 --> 00:13:15,965
As you see, Joe's been creative
with our electrical dilemma.

149
00:13:18,455 --> 00:13:22,084
I done this before
and I ain't never been killed yet.

150
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:24,724
But there's a first time for everything.

151
00:13:32,135 --> 00:13:33,011
There we go!

152
00:13:33,255 --> 00:13:34,449
We got it!

153
00:13:35,655 --> 00:13:36,565
No problem.

154
00:13:37,015 --> 00:13:38,084
Joe Odom?

155
00:13:38,335 --> 00:13:39,563
The one, the only.

156
00:13:39,935 --> 00:13:41,288
Where's my libation?

157
00:13:41,575 --> 00:13:42,405
Hold these.

158
00:13:44,135 --> 00:13:46,330
To Savannah Electric and Power!

159
00:13:46,975 --> 00:13:49,284
And let's not forget our friends...

160
00:13:49,855 --> 00:13:50,765
...the...

161
00:13:51,215 --> 00:13:51,931
...whoever!

162
00:13:53,455 --> 00:13:55,764
Here's to you!
All right, inside.

163
00:13:56,775 --> 00:14:01,132
Honey, that's a tough job,
but you're talking to the lady. Hello!

164
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:05,008
Have you met Mr. Kelso,
our newest addition to Savannah?

165
00:14:05,295 --> 00:14:06,614
Jerry Spence.

166
00:14:06,855 --> 00:14:08,573
- How are you?
- I'm charmed now.

167
00:14:08,855 --> 00:14:10,971
- How are you?
- I'm pretty good.

168
00:14:11,215 --> 00:14:13,331
- I wonder if he goes to my church?
- I wonder.

169
00:14:13,655 --> 00:14:14,644
Episcopalian.

170
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:16,089
We'll find out.

171
00:14:16,335 --> 00:14:17,563
<i>Sanitation</i>

172
00:14:18,175 --> 00:14:20,735
<i>I see all night long</i>
<i>Hauling in great big cans</i>

173
00:14:23,015 --> 00:14:26,246
<i>I'm hoping one day soon</i>
<i>She'll let me be a Hefty man</i>

174
00:14:27,695 --> 00:14:30,084
<i>In the Dumpster</i>
<i>We'll be making love</i>

175
00:14:30,335 --> 00:14:32,485
<i>In the Dumpster</i>
<i>Beneath the stars above</i>

176
00:14:32,815 --> 00:14:35,170
<i>In the Dumpster</i>
<i>I smell paradise</i>

177
00:14:35,455 --> 00:14:37,286
<i>Don 't have to ask me twice</i>

178
00:14:37,575 --> 00:14:39,531
<i>It's all I'm thinking of</i>

179
00:14:39,775 --> 00:14:42,335
<i>Just me and that trash girl</i>
<i>Making that Dumpster love</i>

180
00:14:54,575 --> 00:14:55,451
Do you like that?

181
00:14:55,695 --> 00:14:56,844
Strong.

182
00:14:57,215 --> 00:14:59,888
Strong and good.
Chatham Artillery punch.

183
00:15:00,175 --> 00:15:01,130
What's in it?

184
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,093
3 parts fruit, 7 parts liquor.

185
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:05,331
Whatever's available on both counts.

186
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:07,293
Great party. Great house.

187
00:15:08,335 --> 00:15:12,692
The fella that owns it is in Europe
for a year. Asked me to look in on it.

188
00:15:12,975 --> 00:15:14,294
Water the plants.

189
00:15:17,575 --> 00:15:18,371
Squatting?

190
00:15:19,735 --> 00:15:21,487
That's a vicious word.

191
00:15:21,815 --> 00:15:23,453
You're not a lawyer, are you?

192
00:15:25,135 --> 00:15:28,207
Good. They're the scum of the earth.
And I should know...

193
00:15:28,495 --> 00:15:31,055
...being an ex-barrister myself.

194
00:15:31,455 --> 00:15:32,410
Ex?

195
00:15:33,055 --> 00:15:36,206
Ceremoniously disbarred
not two years ago.

196
00:15:36,495 --> 00:15:38,372
Had a little accounting snafu.

197
00:15:38,975 --> 00:15:40,203
What do you do now?

198
00:15:40,455 --> 00:15:43,253
Me and Mandy,
we're going to open a piano bar.

199
00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:44,610
You already have one.

200
00:15:44,855 --> 00:15:46,334
Looks that way, doesn't it?

201
00:15:46,855 --> 00:15:49,005
Wait a minute. Hold the music.

202
00:15:49,295 --> 00:15:50,171
Look.

203
00:15:52,095 --> 00:15:53,323
Look at this.

204
00:15:53,655 --> 00:15:54,724
Jerry Spence.

205
00:15:55,895 --> 00:15:58,614
You have outdone yourself again.

206
00:15:58,855 --> 00:16:02,450
That is a coif definitely befitting
your stature as the future ex...

207
00:16:02,775 --> 00:16:04,174
...Mrs. Joe Odom.

208
00:16:04,895 --> 00:16:06,613
Keep dreaming, darling.

209
00:16:07,015 --> 00:16:08,209
You're in love.

210
00:16:11,815 --> 00:16:13,806
She is one beautiful woman.

211
00:16:14,175 --> 00:16:15,574
You two engaged?

212
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:17,844
Not yet.

213
00:16:19,575 --> 00:16:22,647
It's getting late. I'm going to
hit the road. Nice meeting you.

214
00:16:22,895 --> 00:16:24,248
No, wait a minute.

215
00:16:25,135 --> 00:16:26,773
Joe's rule #2:

216
00:16:27,055 --> 00:16:31,048
If you have to leave a party,
you always take a traveler.

217
00:16:32,015 --> 00:16:34,404
I can live with that one.
Nice to meet you.

218
00:16:41,735 --> 00:16:42,724
Hey, there.

219
00:16:43,655 --> 00:16:46,169
Better to be on the edge of a party,
don't you think?

220
00:16:48,415 --> 00:16:49,689
Thanks for inviting me.

221
00:16:49,935 --> 00:16:50,970
Anytime.

222
00:16:51,215 --> 00:16:52,489
Every time.

223
00:16:58,895 --> 00:17:00,010
Earlier...

224
00:17:00,255 --> 00:17:01,574
...how'd you know my name?

225
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:03,447
Welcome to Savannah.

226
00:17:11,215 --> 00:17:12,330
Mr. John Kelso?

227
00:17:14,415 --> 00:17:15,370
This is for you.

228
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:26,685
<i>I'm not in. Leave a message</i>
<i>and I'll get back to you.</i>

229
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:48,373
- Mr. Kelso?
- Yes.

230
00:17:48,615 --> 00:17:51,209
I'm Lucille Wright.
I cater Mr. Williams' parties.

231
00:17:51,455 --> 00:17:53,173
- Nice to meet you.
- He'll be down shortly.

232
00:17:53,415 --> 00:17:55,167
Would you like to see what we'll serve?

233
00:17:55,415 --> 00:17:56,609
Of course.

234
00:17:56,855 --> 00:17:57,924
Come in.

235
00:18:00,215 --> 00:18:02,490
Lots of fresh vegetables...

236
00:18:02,735 --> 00:18:04,293
...hot bread...

237
00:18:04,535 --> 00:18:05,934
...jumbo shrimp.

238
00:18:07,535 --> 00:18:10,129
Let's see.
This is smoked ham and turkey.

239
00:18:10,735 --> 00:18:11,451
Both.

240
00:18:11,695 --> 00:18:15,654
A big fruit platter.
And this is a wonderful crab dish.

241
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:16,805
A bisque?

242
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:18,125
Jeff Braswell.

243
00:18:19,735 --> 00:18:23,011
- I shoot Jim's parties.
- Let's get a shot of the whole spread.

244
00:18:23,255 --> 00:18:25,644
<i>Town & Country</i>
loves its pretty pictures.

245
00:18:26,135 --> 00:18:28,091
And pumpkin cornbread.

246
00:18:29,455 --> 00:18:33,004
Mr. Williams insists on
low-country cooking for his parties.

247
00:18:33,495 --> 00:18:36,293
Oh, you're going to have fun tonight.

248
00:18:36,535 --> 00:18:38,287
Indeed he is, Lucille.

249
00:18:39,415 --> 00:18:41,724
Good fit. 44 long.

250
00:18:45,335 --> 00:18:47,610
I have an eye for framing things.

251
00:18:49,935 --> 00:18:51,926
Welcome to Mercer House, Mr. Kelso.

252
00:18:52,855 --> 00:18:55,244
You have outdone yourself again
this year.

253
00:18:55,495 --> 00:18:56,974
Well, thank you.

254
00:19:31,575 --> 00:19:32,928
I'm glad to see you.
Merry Christmas.

255
00:19:33,295 --> 00:19:34,648
Merry Christmas.

256
00:19:34,895 --> 00:19:38,365
There you are. The man with the cigar.
So happy you're back.

257
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:40,050
Emma.

258
00:19:41,615 --> 00:19:44,209
Did you watch my drink for me?
Merry Christmas.

259
00:19:44,455 --> 00:19:46,810
I thought you'd tried
to steal it from me.

260
00:19:47,335 --> 00:19:48,927
- Senator, how are you?
- Great.

261
00:19:49,575 --> 00:19:52,772
Merry Christmas to you.
So happy to have you here.

262
00:19:53,615 --> 00:19:54,809
Look at you.

263
00:19:57,175 --> 00:19:59,052
Welcome to Mercer House.

264
00:20:18,895 --> 00:20:21,455
I think we have
quite a party going tonight.

265
00:20:22,335 --> 00:20:24,451
Look at that niece of mine.
Come over here.

266
00:20:28,855 --> 00:20:30,652
- How are you?
- John Kelso.

267
00:20:41,895 --> 00:20:45,604
Oh, darling!
You look so pretty tonight.

268
00:20:45,855 --> 00:20:47,607
I have one just like that at home.

269
00:20:48,615 --> 00:20:51,129
I see our emerald bird has arrived.

270
00:20:51,775 --> 00:20:54,164
Good to see you.
Handsome as ever.

271
00:20:54,415 --> 00:20:56,724
- How are you, dear?
- I'm just fine.

272
00:21:01,575 --> 00:21:03,645
Now who is that magnificent creature?

273
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:05,169
That is Serena Dawes.

274
00:21:05,415 --> 00:21:07,610
Serena, you are
as gorgeous as ever.

275
00:21:07,855 --> 00:21:09,083
I try.

276
00:21:09,335 --> 00:21:11,132
Celebrated beauty in her day.

277
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:14,890
When her tycoon husband died, she
moved back to Savannah and created...

278
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:17,933
...sort of a museum to herself
in her boudoir.

279
00:21:18,175 --> 00:21:19,574
I'll introduce you.

280
00:21:19,815 --> 00:21:22,090
- You look very nice.
- Who are these people?

281
00:21:23,855 --> 00:21:26,369
How lovely to see you out of bed.

282
00:21:27,735 --> 00:21:31,205
Why, Jim,
I'd get out of bed for you anytime.

283
00:21:35,095 --> 00:21:39,213
Harry was just about to show us
the latest addition to his arsenal.

284
00:21:41,575 --> 00:21:44,135
You know what that is?
That is a.25.

285
00:21:44,415 --> 00:21:47,532
My late husband blew his brains out
with one of those.

286
00:21:47,775 --> 00:21:49,686
- So did mine.
- What?

287
00:21:50,055 --> 00:21:53,843
I was fixing myself a drink and <i>Gunsmoke</i>
was on TV and I heard a shot.

288
00:21:54,175 --> 00:21:58,691
I thought it was part of the show till
I walked in and Lyman was bleeding...

289
00:21:58,935 --> 00:22:01,403
...sprawled in his favorite chair.

290
00:22:01,655 --> 00:22:04,169
Everyone knew
our marriage was a disaster.

291
00:22:04,415 --> 00:22:09,011
If I'd so much as touched that gun,
they'd have charged me with murder.

292
00:22:11,775 --> 00:22:13,731
Yes, well, one day...

293
00:22:17,615 --> 00:22:21,085
...I will shoot a man.
I may start with you. Or you.

294
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:29,093
- Is that loaded?
- Oh, yeah.

295
00:22:31,175 --> 00:22:32,654
Which conversation shall we join?

296
00:22:32,895 --> 00:22:35,455
The one least likely to involve gunfire.

297
00:22:35,975 --> 00:22:37,613
Excuse me for a moment.

298
00:22:57,775 --> 00:23:00,130
That's from Napoleon's
coronation carriage.

299
00:23:01,175 --> 00:23:02,813
You have an impressive collection.

300
00:23:03,775 --> 00:23:07,370
No, Mr. Kelso. Look around.
It's not a collection, it's my home.

301
00:23:07,615 --> 00:23:09,765
- Fabergé?
- I'm a minor enthusiast.

302
00:23:10,015 --> 00:23:12,085
Minor? Three eggs...

303
00:23:12,495 --> 00:23:15,214
...a jewelry box and, I believe,
a gold-leaf album.

304
00:23:15,655 --> 00:23:18,613
Nicholas himself would be lucky
to have so much Fabergé.

305
00:23:21,575 --> 00:23:22,405
Wouldn't he?

306
00:23:22,655 --> 00:23:23,929
I admit to that.

307
00:23:25,175 --> 00:23:27,609
Would you care
to see something a little more...

308
00:23:27,895 --> 00:23:29,169
...unusual?

309
00:23:29,415 --> 00:23:30,894
That'd be very nice.

310
00:23:36,855 --> 00:23:38,527
Hello, Mother, darling.

311
00:23:38,775 --> 00:23:41,528
- Are you enjoying yourself?
- I'm having a wonderful time.

312
00:23:41,775 --> 00:23:42,969
John Kelso.

313
00:23:43,615 --> 00:23:45,173
He's a writer, Mother.

314
00:23:53,495 --> 00:23:55,725
This is what we call the ballroom.

315
00:24:00,575 --> 00:24:02,293
Is this the prized relic?

316
00:24:02,655 --> 00:24:04,964
It's a very rare relic.

317
00:24:08,215 --> 00:24:11,412
This is the dagger
that Prince Yussopov used...

318
00:24:11,895 --> 00:24:13,328
...to murder Rasputin.

319
00:24:16,055 --> 00:24:18,523
He sliced off
his cock and balls with it.

320
00:24:18,775 --> 00:24:19,969
True story...

321
00:24:20,215 --> 00:24:22,809
...and deliciously evil,
don't you think?

322
00:24:23,575 --> 00:24:24,724
Delicious.

323
00:24:28,015 --> 00:24:29,084
German Luger?

324
00:24:29,335 --> 00:24:32,054
Be careful, it's loaded.
We've had burglaries.

325
00:24:33,175 --> 00:24:35,370
Everybody's got loaded guns around here.

326
00:24:37,295 --> 00:24:39,855
So tell me.
Has your family always collected?

327
00:24:40,095 --> 00:24:44,008
That's a very genteel way of asking
if I come from old money.

328
00:24:44,735 --> 00:24:46,248
- Do you?
- No.

329
00:24:47,295 --> 00:24:50,367
I was born in Gordon, Georgia,
a little town outside of Macon.

330
00:24:50,615 --> 00:24:52,845
My father was a barber,
sometime house builder.

331
00:24:53,095 --> 00:24:54,687
My mother was a secretary.

332
00:24:54,935 --> 00:24:57,449
What money I have is about 11 years old.

333
00:24:57,895 --> 00:24:59,931
So, yes, I am...

334
00:25:00,175 --> 00:25:01,733
<i>... nouveau riche.</i>

335
00:25:01,975 --> 00:25:04,330
But then it's the <i>riche</i> that counts.

336
00:25:05,015 --> 00:25:06,687
There's only 2 things
that interest me...

337
00:25:06,935 --> 00:25:07,924
...work...

338
00:25:08,175 --> 00:25:11,565
...and those trappings of aristocracy
that I find worthwhile.

339
00:25:11,855 --> 00:25:15,530
The very things they're forced to sell
when the money runs out.

340
00:25:15,775 --> 00:25:17,413
And it always runs out.

341
00:25:17,775 --> 00:25:19,811
And then all they're left with...

342
00:25:20,375 --> 00:25:22,047
...is their lovely manners.

343
00:25:22,295 --> 00:25:25,207
Fuck you, goddamn bitch!

344
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:27,726
Wouldn't even let me in the house.

345
00:25:27,975 --> 00:25:29,567
Had to come in the servants' entrance.

346
00:25:30,655 --> 00:25:32,008
Excuse me for a minute?

347
00:25:34,535 --> 00:25:36,446
We agreed you'd stay away tonight.

348
00:25:36,695 --> 00:25:38,447
Don't give me that drag-ass shit.

349
00:25:38,695 --> 00:25:41,892
I got stood up tonight, I'm pissed off.
Give me $20.

350
00:25:43,295 --> 00:25:45,889
You get paid on Friday
like everyone else.

351
00:25:46,135 --> 00:25:47,170
Give me $20.

352
00:25:47,415 --> 00:25:51,010
- I need it to get fucked up, is what.
- You've accomplished that, sport.

353
00:25:51,695 --> 00:25:52,605
Give me the money.

354
00:25:52,895 --> 00:25:55,534
I ain't even close to getting fucked up
the way I want to get.

355
00:25:55,775 --> 00:25:58,573
I'm not going to give you money
for liquor or marijuana...

356
00:25:58,815 --> 00:26:00,328
...or whatever else you've invited...

357
00:26:01,215 --> 00:26:02,330
Fuck you, Jim!

358
00:26:02,575 --> 00:26:06,284
You don't give me warnings! I give them
to you! I can back mine up.

359
00:26:11,855 --> 00:26:13,573
And you, you piece of shit!

360
00:26:16,015 --> 00:26:17,653
You better watch yourself.

361
00:26:20,055 --> 00:26:21,170
Fuck you.

362
00:26:35,095 --> 00:26:38,883
That's Billy Hanson.
He works part-time in the shop...

363
00:26:39,415 --> 00:26:42,134
...and can, on occasion,
be a very colorful character.

364
00:27:06,095 --> 00:27:09,690
I don't know who hates me more,
the Atwells or their dogs.

365
00:27:09,935 --> 00:27:13,928
Lon Atwell's been upset with me since I
had him removed from the museum board.

366
00:27:18,655 --> 00:27:20,850
There's only one way to remedy this.

367
00:28:23,015 --> 00:28:24,528
Thank you, Senator.

368
00:28:24,775 --> 00:28:26,686
It was a hell of a bash, Jim.

369
00:28:26,975 --> 00:28:29,330
- You've outdone yourself.
- Delightful.

370
00:28:29,615 --> 00:28:32,254
We thoroughly enjoyed it.
Thanks for having us.

371
00:28:42,375 --> 00:28:43,933
This...
You have my book.

372
00:28:44,255 --> 00:28:45,927
You seem surprised.

373
00:28:46,815 --> 00:28:49,568
It didn't exactly
fly off the bookshelves.

374
00:28:56,575 --> 00:28:59,373
What a coincidence,
that I'd be assigned...

375
00:28:59,695 --> 00:29:02,767
...to this story
and you'd have read my only book.

376
00:29:04,655 --> 00:29:06,646
There are no coincidences.

377
00:29:07,215 --> 00:29:09,683
Have you ever written
for <i>Town & Country</i> before?

378
00:29:09,975 --> 00:29:10,885
No.

379
00:29:14,815 --> 00:29:16,248
You requested me?

380
00:29:18,615 --> 00:29:21,493
They've wanted to cover
my Christmas party for years.

381
00:29:21,775 --> 00:29:26,166
My acceptance of their offer this year
was contingent on one thing:

382
00:29:26,415 --> 00:29:27,973
Your participation.

383
00:29:31,135 --> 00:29:32,329
Thank you for that.

384
00:29:33,375 --> 00:29:34,854
No, thank you.

385
00:29:36,175 --> 00:29:40,851
Now sit back, relax, enjoy your brandy
and tell me your life story, John Kelso.

386
00:29:45,215 --> 00:29:47,490
It's getting late
and I have an early flight...

387
00:29:47,735 --> 00:29:51,205
...so maybe I can take
a rain check on that. Next Christmas.

388
00:29:52,015 --> 00:29:53,653
If you make the cut.

389
00:29:54,615 --> 00:29:56,333
We'll hope for the best.

390
00:29:56,615 --> 00:29:59,846
I can't wait to see the article,
and I hope you have enough...

391
00:30:00,335 --> 00:30:01,814
...for your 500-word essay.

392
00:30:02,095 --> 00:30:03,926
Believe me, I could use 10,000.

393
00:30:04,175 --> 00:30:06,086
Thanks for everything.
I'll show myself out.

394
00:30:10,335 --> 00:30:11,848
Oh, and sport...

395
00:30:14,255 --> 00:30:15,973
...I really did like your book.

396
00:30:17,375 --> 00:30:18,410
Thank you.

397
00:30:39,935 --> 00:30:42,733
That's a beautiful jacket.
I believe it's an endangered species.

398
00:30:42,975 --> 00:30:46,251
Look at that 14-karat gold dress
and Tony Manero.

399
00:30:46,495 --> 00:30:47,769
Who's hungry?

400
00:30:48,615 --> 00:30:50,412
Want some punch, baby?

401
00:30:50,655 --> 00:30:53,169
Oh, that's such a good pony.

402
00:30:53,735 --> 00:30:56,169
What are you doing,
getting that horse drunk?

403
00:30:57,295 --> 00:30:58,205
What happened?

404
00:30:58,535 --> 00:31:00,810
That Jim Williams
went and shot somebody.

405
00:31:01,055 --> 00:31:02,090
Canapé?

406
00:31:02,815 --> 00:31:03,691
What?

407
00:31:03,975 --> 00:31:07,285
He sure did. Those lights
ain't part of the Christmas display.

408
00:31:07,575 --> 00:31:08,405
For real?

409
00:31:08,655 --> 00:31:10,771
Yes, sir. He shot somebody.

410
00:31:12,095 --> 00:31:13,687
Look at that man go.

411
00:31:13,935 --> 00:31:15,766
I'm starting to like that Yankee.

412
00:31:16,015 --> 00:31:19,644
What's that saying?
Curiosity killed the Yankee? That's it.

413
00:31:25,535 --> 00:31:28,971
He was drunker when he got back,
and I'll tell you...

414
00:31:29,615 --> 00:31:33,927
...when he's been drinking,
he's got another personality altogether.

415
00:31:34,855 --> 00:31:37,289
He'd already smashed things upstairs
earlier.

416
00:31:37,615 --> 00:31:40,652
And he must've gone
to some drive-in B movie...

417
00:31:40,935 --> 00:31:42,846
...with throats being slashed.

418
00:31:43,095 --> 00:31:47,566
No doubt it had an effect,
because I've never seen him that angry.

419
00:31:48,135 --> 00:31:50,410
He and I got into an argument.

420
00:31:50,735 --> 00:31:54,728
He destroyed this beautiful,
priceless antique clock in the hallway.

421
00:31:55,015 --> 00:31:56,209
If you'd like to...

422
00:31:56,775 --> 00:31:57,844
...spike that up...

423
00:31:58,095 --> 00:31:59,494
...the bar's in the living room.

424
00:31:59,735 --> 00:32:01,646
No, thank you.
I'm still on duty.

425
00:32:03,775 --> 00:32:04,844
I know that.

426
00:32:06,575 --> 00:32:07,690
I'm sorry.

427
00:32:08,055 --> 00:32:09,966
This is very upsetting.

428
00:32:10,855 --> 00:32:13,085
How much longer
is this going to take?

429
00:32:21,895 --> 00:32:23,408
What are you doing here?

430
00:32:23,735 --> 00:32:26,010
I work for the city, too.
I got the film from that party.

431
00:32:26,255 --> 00:32:27,449
I'll get it to you.

432
00:32:27,735 --> 00:32:28,929
Great, great.

433
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:41,691
He came into the office
and he stood there and he yelled...

434
00:32:41,975 --> 00:32:45,570
..."I might be leaving tomorrow, but
goddamn it, you're leaving tonight."

435
00:32:45,815 --> 00:32:49,808
Then he fired at me twice and I pulled
the Luger from my desk and fired back.

436
00:32:50,095 --> 00:32:53,132
If it had happened to you,
you would've done exactly what I did.

437
00:32:53,375 --> 00:32:56,572
I have never been so scared in my life.
If I had not shot at Billy...

438
00:32:56,815 --> 00:33:00,012
...I have no doubt it'd be my obituary
you'd be reading tomorrow.

439
00:33:00,255 --> 00:33:02,371
- What're you doing here?
- The thing was open.

440
00:33:02,615 --> 00:33:03,889
Jesus Christ, Frank!

441
00:33:05,055 --> 00:33:06,966
My client has nothing to say.

442
00:33:09,215 --> 00:33:12,093
I can't believe you would do this
without calling me!

443
00:33:12,335 --> 00:33:14,087
How long have we known each other?!

444
00:33:14,375 --> 00:33:17,208
Is this entrapment, Frank?
What the hell is going on?

445
00:33:56,255 --> 00:33:58,769
Sorry, I'm not going to have time
to process this.

446
00:33:59,015 --> 00:34:00,926
Film from the party.

447
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:15,133
Jim told me
you heard Hanson threaten him.

448
00:34:15,815 --> 00:34:17,407
No-good street hustler.

449
00:34:17,735 --> 00:34:19,885
I told Jim he was dangerous.

450
00:34:25,655 --> 00:34:27,088
<i>Forget about</i> Town & Country.

451
00:34:27,335 --> 00:34:31,169
I know I've been here only 3 days and
it's just a shooting, but give it time.

452
00:34:31,455 --> 00:34:34,572
This place is fantastic. It's like
<i>Gone With the Wind</i> on mescaline.

453
00:34:35,375 --> 00:34:37,764
I know you're my agent.
Listen to me.

454
00:34:38,015 --> 00:34:41,132
They walk imaginary pets here
on a fucking leash, okay?

455
00:34:41,375 --> 00:34:43,684
They're all heavily armed and drunk.
New York is boring.

456
00:34:43,935 --> 00:34:45,129
I'll call you later.

457
00:34:46,575 --> 00:34:50,614
Finley Largent's up for reelection,
so he'll try to get this to trial.

458
00:34:50,855 --> 00:34:52,925
He won't take my damn phone calls...

459
00:34:53,175 --> 00:34:55,211
...so we'll have to use the back door.

460
00:34:55,455 --> 00:34:56,774
I'll be back.

461
00:34:57,015 --> 00:34:58,926
Thanks for coming over, coach.

462
00:34:59,415 --> 00:35:01,007
Jim's in the office.

463
00:35:06,615 --> 00:35:08,970
We talked about something
we'd like to run by you.

464
00:35:09,255 --> 00:35:11,086
You want me to kill the story.

465
00:35:11,815 --> 00:35:12,725
Done.

466
00:35:14,735 --> 00:35:16,214
Great, great.

467
00:35:19,015 --> 00:35:19,925
Why?

468
00:35:21,175 --> 00:35:22,608
Actually, I was...

469
00:35:23,015 --> 00:35:24,289
...considering...

470
00:35:24,695 --> 00:35:25,889
...writing a book.

471
00:35:26,455 --> 00:35:28,764
Sweet Jesus. A book about what?

472
00:35:29,015 --> 00:35:30,767
Self-defense happens all the time.

473
00:35:31,015 --> 00:35:34,052
Then why are you worried about the D.A.?
I overheard in the lobby.

474
00:35:34,295 --> 00:35:35,887
We're a small town.

475
00:35:36,135 --> 00:35:38,603
We defend ourselves, our reputations...

476
00:35:38,935 --> 00:35:40,687
...against the outside world.

477
00:35:41,095 --> 00:35:44,132
Word gets around a New Yorker's
trying to make us look bad...

478
00:35:44,655 --> 00:35:46,930
...you'll find Savannahians
can get tight-lipped.

479
00:35:47,975 --> 00:35:49,886
If there's a trial, will I be a witness?

480
00:35:50,295 --> 00:35:51,569
You threatening me?

481
00:35:51,855 --> 00:35:52,810
Absolutely not.

482
00:35:53,175 --> 00:35:55,814
You perjure yourself,
you'll find yourself in jail.

483
00:35:56,135 --> 00:35:59,252
I wouldn't do it. When it comes
to this, I'm at ground zero.

484
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:01,173
If there's nothing worth writing...

485
00:36:01,615 --> 00:36:02,934
...then you got no worries.

486
00:36:03,415 --> 00:36:06,851
That's what I get paid for.
I will not permit this.

487
00:36:10,935 --> 00:36:13,244
I don't need anyone's permission.

488
00:36:14,215 --> 00:36:15,409
Not really.

489
00:36:17,815 --> 00:36:19,726
Then why are you soliciting it?

490
00:36:23,335 --> 00:36:24,768
You need my permission...

491
00:36:25,015 --> 00:36:26,050
...my help...

492
00:36:26,295 --> 00:36:27,853
...my acquiescence...

493
00:36:28,535 --> 00:36:30,207
...or you don't have a story.

494
00:36:31,175 --> 00:36:32,369
Not really.

495
00:36:33,175 --> 00:36:34,893
We both know that.

496
00:36:37,535 --> 00:36:40,003
So would the river flow both ways?

497
00:36:40,775 --> 00:36:41,890
Meaning?

498
00:36:43,895 --> 00:36:47,729
Would you share whatever information
you garner with me and Sonny?

499
00:36:49,655 --> 00:36:52,328
Yes, but it won't change what I write.

500
00:36:52,655 --> 00:36:55,533
And you don't get to see a word of it
until it's published.

501
00:37:06,735 --> 00:37:07,724
So...

502
00:37:08,295 --> 00:37:10,650
...who'd be the main character
in this book?

503
00:37:17,335 --> 00:37:19,690
Have you written up cases
like this before?

504
00:37:19,935 --> 00:37:21,891
A few of them for <i>Esquire,</i> yeah.

505
00:37:22,135 --> 00:37:23,363
What do you think?

506
00:37:23,615 --> 00:37:24,843
What do I think?

507
00:37:25,295 --> 00:37:28,332
If you're worried about the D.A.,
grand juries read papers.

508
00:37:28,575 --> 00:37:30,850
Proper spin control
could make a big difference.

509
00:37:31,095 --> 00:37:32,926
What the hell are you talking about?

510
00:37:33,175 --> 00:37:35,973
You said Hanson was a street hustler.
Did he have a record?

511
00:37:36,215 --> 00:37:38,012
Take drugs?
Deal drugs? Pimp?

512
00:37:38,255 --> 00:37:40,485
That kind of spin
can influence a grand jury.

513
00:37:40,735 --> 00:37:42,373
Get investigators to hit the streets.

514
00:37:42,615 --> 00:37:45,288
Every P.I. In town's an off-duty cop.

515
00:37:45,815 --> 00:37:48,454
Besides, why would we need a P. I...

516
00:37:48,695 --> 00:37:51,812
...when we got ourselves
a hotshot New York writer...

517
00:37:52,055 --> 00:37:53,807
...filling all the gaps?

518
00:37:56,175 --> 00:37:57,494
Take care, bubba.

519
00:38:17,455 --> 00:38:19,446
- Are you the flower man?
- No, I'm John Kelso.

520
00:38:19,695 --> 00:38:21,925
Good morning, I'm a writer
and wanted to ask you...

521
00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:24,564
If you're not the flower man,
leave me be.

522
00:38:24,815 --> 00:38:28,569
The Lady's in mourning, and
I haven't received a flower or a rose...

523
00:38:28,815 --> 00:38:31,727
...or anything to show for it.
Please leave me be.

524
00:38:35,215 --> 00:38:39,049
I know Billy Hanson used to live here.
I wanted to ask a few questions.

525
00:38:39,295 --> 00:38:41,968
And if it's an inappropriate time,
I'll come back later.

526
00:38:42,215 --> 00:38:46,891
I can't believe you're running around
ringing my doorbell. Where you from?

527
00:38:47,215 --> 00:38:48,887
Where are your manners?

528
00:38:49,135 --> 00:38:50,887
Just leave me be.

529
00:38:53,615 --> 00:38:55,731
My condolences.
I'll call...

530
00:38:56,495 --> 00:38:58,725
I'll come back another time, or...

531
00:40:22,575 --> 00:40:24,964
I apologize for the delay.

532
00:40:26,735 --> 00:40:31,445
Why, thank you. They're lovely.
They're absolutely lovely.

533
00:40:31,695 --> 00:40:34,414
I'd love to ask you a few questions,
if you have a minute.

534
00:40:34,895 --> 00:40:36,613
Is this your car?

535
00:40:38,575 --> 00:40:40,133
How about a ride home?

536
00:40:44,135 --> 00:40:45,250
Thank you.

537
00:40:53,895 --> 00:40:56,967
What I want to know is,
what is a white boy like you...

538
00:40:57,215 --> 00:41:01,527
...doing driving a big old brother's
jive-ass heap like this shit here?

539
00:41:01,775 --> 00:41:04,926
I just bought this.
I kind of like it. It's not a bad car.

540
00:41:05,175 --> 00:41:07,769
No, it's not bad.
Did I hurt your feelings?

541
00:41:08,015 --> 00:41:10,609
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.

542
00:41:10,855 --> 00:41:14,165
I can't help it.
I just call things out as I see it.

543
00:41:14,415 --> 00:41:16,292
I just can't help it.
I just do that.

544
00:41:16,775 --> 00:41:19,209
- One thing you needn't worry about.
- What's that?

545
00:41:19,455 --> 00:41:23,004
Ain't nobody going to try
to steal this piece of shit.

546
00:41:23,655 --> 00:41:26,965
I'm just practicing up till I can save
enough money to get my Rolls.

547
00:41:27,215 --> 00:41:30,013
Chablis is a pretty name.
It's unusual.

548
00:41:30,255 --> 00:41:34,328
Thank you. I got it off a wine bottle.
It's a show name.

549
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:38,284
- You're an actress?
- I'm not an actress. I'm a showgirl.

550
00:41:38,535 --> 00:41:40,969
I work at the Pick-Up on Congress.

551
00:41:41,215 --> 00:41:44,890
I lip-synch, I emcee, I dance.
You know, shit like that.

552
00:41:45,135 --> 00:41:48,889
The person you see now
is just little old simple Chablis.

553
00:41:49,135 --> 00:41:50,454
But in the evenings...

554
00:41:50,695 --> 00:41:53,926
...when I put on my gowns
and my makeup...

555
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:56,769
...and my jewelry and my perfume...

556
00:41:57,015 --> 00:41:59,165
...I become "The Lady Chablis."

557
00:42:01,575 --> 00:42:03,930
You are just so cute.

558
00:42:04,175 --> 00:42:06,450
A cool white wine for a cool black girl.

559
00:42:06,695 --> 00:42:09,732
And you're full of flattery too.

560
00:42:10,535 --> 00:42:14,892
It's getting hot up in here, honey.
My shots are kicking in.

561
00:42:16,415 --> 00:42:17,325
Excuse me?

562
00:42:17,575 --> 00:42:20,089
Yes, honey, my shots.
Never mind that.

563
00:42:20,335 --> 00:42:22,405
What'd you want to talk to me about?

564
00:42:23,935 --> 00:42:25,050
Billy Hanson.

565
00:42:26,975 --> 00:42:30,570
No. Billy's dead.
Case closed.

566
00:42:31,175 --> 00:42:32,574
Was he your boyfriend?

567
00:42:32,815 --> 00:42:34,328
Billy, my boyfriend?

568
00:42:34,575 --> 00:42:35,974
Were you two lovers?

569
00:42:36,775 --> 00:42:38,003
No. Hell, no.

570
00:42:38,255 --> 00:42:41,053
Billy was way too trashy for me, honey.
I'm a lady.

571
00:42:41,295 --> 00:42:43,934
However, he did date
my roommate Corinne for a while.

572
00:42:45,455 --> 00:42:49,084
The two of those
had some wild times together.

573
00:42:53,135 --> 00:42:56,445
- Those are beautiful.
- So, tell me more about Corinne.

574
00:42:57,175 --> 00:42:59,450
Corinne's like a lot of girls.

575
00:43:00,055 --> 00:43:03,286
She found herself attracted
to the wrong type of man.

576
00:43:04,095 --> 00:43:07,804
Billy was not the right type of man.
She thought she could change him.

577
00:43:08,055 --> 00:43:11,252
But there was no way of changing
that evil son of a bitch.

578
00:43:11,495 --> 00:43:13,963
- I'd love to speak to Corinne.
- I'd like to too.

579
00:43:14,215 --> 00:43:18,288
But she skipped town
owing me two months' rent.

580
00:43:18,535 --> 00:43:21,368
And Billy said he would pay for it,
but now he's...

581
00:43:23,895 --> 00:43:25,533
But you know...

582
00:43:25,775 --> 00:43:27,845
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

583
00:43:28,095 --> 00:43:30,814
But you know,
it's like my mama always said...

584
00:43:32,895 --> 00:43:34,851
..."Two tears in a bucket...

585
00:43:35,095 --> 00:43:37,211
...motherfuck it."

586
00:43:38,535 --> 00:43:39,888
I have to remember that one.

587
00:43:40,135 --> 00:43:42,410
Don't remember that one.
That's off-the-record.

588
00:43:50,055 --> 00:43:51,534
Let me get your door for you.

589
00:44:04,655 --> 00:44:06,088
Thank you, hon.

590
00:44:11,855 --> 00:44:15,643
In the phone book,
you were listed as F. De Veau.

591
00:44:17,575 --> 00:44:19,133
What's the "F" stand for?

592
00:44:20,975 --> 00:44:23,364
The "F" stands for Frank, hon.

593
00:44:23,615 --> 00:44:24,843
That's me.

594
00:44:38,855 --> 00:44:40,686
- She's a he.
- Correct.

595
00:44:40,855 --> 00:44:42,129
You're shitting me.

596
00:44:42,375 --> 00:44:45,094
If this thing heats up,
I think you'll want to talk to her.

597
00:44:45,335 --> 00:44:47,166
Proper folks don't discuss such things.

598
00:44:47,615 --> 00:44:49,446
She paints a rotten picture of Billy.

599
00:44:49,695 --> 00:44:52,846
Let me tell you a story.
There was a judge here years ago.

600
00:44:53,095 --> 00:44:56,565
His oldest boy was messing around
with a gangster's girlfriend.

601
00:44:57,535 --> 00:44:59,412
One morning they found him...

602
00:45:00,055 --> 00:45:03,445
...lying under the porch
with his privates tucked into his lapel.

603
00:45:05,815 --> 00:45:07,806
Dead men tell no tales.

604
00:45:08,695 --> 00:45:10,686
Next day, headline read...

605
00:45:10,935 --> 00:45:12,766
..."Fall From Porch Proves Fatal."

606
00:45:13,975 --> 00:45:15,806
Some fall.
What's your point?

607
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:20,533
Saving face in the light of unpleasant
circumstances is the Savannah way.

608
00:45:21,975 --> 00:45:24,614
I'll try to track down that real girl.
Corinne, you said?

609
00:45:25,215 --> 00:45:26,933
Well, I got to skedaddle.

610
00:45:27,175 --> 00:45:30,133
Doing Christmas at Tybee Island.
We got all sorts of folks coming.

611
00:45:30,375 --> 00:45:31,694
Have a great Christmas.

612
00:45:31,935 --> 00:45:34,290
- You too, John.
- See you later, Uga.

613
00:45:43,135 --> 00:45:45,171
<i>Merry Christmas!</i>

614
00:46:27,375 --> 00:46:28,933
He's got it on a string!

615
00:46:50,855 --> 00:46:52,413
Luther's not eating!

616
00:47:00,495 --> 00:47:01,689
Check, please.

617
00:47:03,015 --> 00:47:04,334
You didn't like it?

618
00:47:04,775 --> 00:47:07,050
No, they were very good.
Excellent.

619
00:47:09,495 --> 00:47:10,894
What was in the vial?

620
00:47:12,495 --> 00:47:15,692
He says it's enough poison
to kill everybody in the county.

621
00:47:17,495 --> 00:47:19,451
If he eats and it's a good day...

622
00:47:19,695 --> 00:47:20,605
...fine.

623
00:47:21,295 --> 00:47:22,410
If he doesn't eat...

624
00:47:22,655 --> 00:47:26,933
...let's put it this way: If I were
you, I wouldn't drink the water today.

625
00:47:27,335 --> 00:47:28,848
Where does he put the poison?

626
00:47:29,095 --> 00:47:31,404
In the water supply system.

627
00:47:33,775 --> 00:47:35,208
Is that true?
Do you believe that?

628
00:47:37,255 --> 00:47:41,646
I've lived here a long time, honey.
I believe most anything about anybody.

629
00:47:45,135 --> 00:47:46,409
Where are we going?

630
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:48,532
Patience, dear boy.

631
00:47:52,895 --> 00:47:56,774
It's time you meet the most important
member of my defense team.

632
00:47:57,255 --> 00:47:58,654
We're going to the cemetery?

633
00:47:58,895 --> 00:48:02,365
Not Bonaventure.
The colored cemetery's down the road.

634
00:49:03,255 --> 00:49:06,292
Looks like we got the garden
all to ourselves tonight.

635
00:49:08,935 --> 00:49:10,334
Meet Minerva.

636
00:49:13,335 --> 00:49:14,290
How do you do?

637
00:49:15,975 --> 00:49:17,693
You trying to work me, boy?

638
00:49:18,975 --> 00:49:21,045
Put that hand back in your pocket.

639
00:49:28,535 --> 00:49:30,491
I feel sorry for you.

640
00:49:31,295 --> 00:49:32,887
Do tell, Minerva.

641
00:49:33,375 --> 00:49:35,286
He think nobody love him.

642
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:40,533
That's silly.
We've never met.

643
00:49:43,415 --> 00:49:44,814
You got a hole in you.

644
00:49:45,055 --> 00:49:46,613
Too many questions.

645
00:49:46,855 --> 00:49:50,973
Don't know whether to be this way
or that without the answers.

646
00:49:53,175 --> 00:49:55,735
There ain't no answers.

647
00:50:00,935 --> 00:50:04,211
You come a long way to find that out,
didn't you?

648
00:50:07,175 --> 00:50:09,973
Now we got to get to work.
You bring the money?

649
00:50:12,255 --> 00:50:13,324
Put it on the grave.

650
00:50:15,655 --> 00:50:18,169
Kiss it first,
so it come back to you.

651
00:50:20,535 --> 00:50:22,685
You bring the shiny dimes?

652
00:50:29,735 --> 00:50:30,850
Bury them.

653
00:50:31,975 --> 00:50:34,967
He's working hard against you, James.

654
00:50:35,255 --> 00:50:36,893
Who? Dr. Buzzard?

655
00:50:39,135 --> 00:50:41,171
The boy. The dead boy.

656
00:50:41,695 --> 00:50:43,686
Oh, Billy.
That doesn't surprise us.

657
00:50:43,935 --> 00:50:45,334
Dr. Buzzard?

658
00:50:47,415 --> 00:50:48,848
Ain't got much dead time left.

659
00:50:49,895 --> 00:50:51,089
Dead time?

660
00:50:51,975 --> 00:50:53,533
Lasts an hour.

661
00:50:53,855 --> 00:50:57,086
Half-hour before midnight
till half past.

662
00:50:57,535 --> 00:51:00,413
Half-hour before midnight
for working good.

663
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:02,805
Half-hour after for evil.

664
00:51:03,055 --> 00:51:05,250
We'll need a little of both tonight.

665
00:51:05,535 --> 00:51:07,127
You got the bottle of water?

666
00:51:09,455 --> 00:51:11,173
Ain't been through no pipe?

667
00:51:12,455 --> 00:51:13,729
Give it to me.

668
00:51:18,495 --> 00:51:20,008
We got to make him...

669
00:51:20,255 --> 00:51:23,167
...Ioosen up on James.

670
00:51:26,895 --> 00:51:28,214
I need Shango...

671
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:30,965
...and a little <i>hungan.</i>

672
00:51:43,855 --> 00:51:44,890
Come.

673
00:51:46,295 --> 00:51:47,410
Come!

674
00:51:52,375 --> 00:51:54,286
Tell me something about him.

675
00:51:55,095 --> 00:51:56,494
He tried to kill me?

676
00:51:56,735 --> 00:51:59,124
No, before then.
Something good.

677
00:52:00,935 --> 00:52:02,050
Your kind words...

678
00:52:02,295 --> 00:52:04,763
...take root, flower,
come back to bless you.

679
00:52:06,135 --> 00:52:07,966
Something that made him happy?

680
00:52:11,455 --> 00:52:12,570
His Camaro.

681
00:52:13,295 --> 00:52:15,934
He loved his Camaro.
He wouldn't let anyone near it.

682
00:52:16,175 --> 00:52:18,325
That car was his pride and joy.

683
00:52:18,975 --> 00:52:21,170
Keep talking. It's working.
It's working!

684
00:52:22,695 --> 00:52:25,653
He spray painted it flat black.

685
00:52:25,895 --> 00:52:29,171
You should've seen him.
He spent hours on that car, fixing it...

686
00:52:29,415 --> 00:52:30,370
...cleaning it.

687
00:52:30,615 --> 00:52:32,810
He painted racing stripes on it...

688
00:52:33,055 --> 00:52:34,773
...and all kinds of other things.

689
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:36,888
He was very creative.

690
00:52:39,575 --> 00:52:41,725
That's something
most people didn't know.

691
00:52:41,975 --> 00:52:43,374
He was an artist.

692
00:52:44,135 --> 00:52:46,603
Just now,
when you were saying them things...

693
00:52:46,855 --> 00:52:48,846
...I felt him ease off.

694
00:52:49,655 --> 00:52:51,691
He heard you say you love him.

695
00:52:54,815 --> 00:52:57,329
That's preposterous.
He tried to kill me.

696
00:52:59,615 --> 00:53:02,004
He was working against you,
and now I know why.

697
00:53:02,415 --> 00:53:05,691
He wants you to tell the whole world
you hated him.

698
00:53:06,695 --> 00:53:09,004
Maybe they think you hated him
enough to kill him.

699
00:53:09,735 --> 00:53:11,691
If you do that, you go to jail...

700
00:53:11,935 --> 00:53:13,209
...and he know that.

701
00:53:14,815 --> 00:53:16,646
Most important thing:

702
00:53:17,735 --> 00:53:21,694
You got to beg that boy's forgiveness
each and every day.

703
00:53:27,455 --> 00:53:29,286
Time for evil.

704
00:53:34,015 --> 00:53:36,449
Quick, quick.
Tell me his name.

705
00:53:36,935 --> 00:53:38,334
Finley Largent.

706
00:53:38,975 --> 00:53:43,526
When you get home, write his name
7 times on a piece of paper.

707
00:53:43,775 --> 00:53:45,766
Connect all the names into one.

708
00:53:46,015 --> 00:53:48,051
Dot no I's, cross no T's.

709
00:53:48,335 --> 00:53:50,610
Fold it twice and put it in your pocket.

710
00:53:54,975 --> 00:53:56,090
Get a picture.

711
00:53:56,335 --> 00:53:59,054
Sew up the mouth with dove's blood.

712
00:53:59,295 --> 00:54:00,444
Blacken the eyes.

713
00:54:00,695 --> 00:54:02,731
Now go!
I got works to do.

714
00:54:06,695 --> 00:54:07,730
Boy!

715
00:54:08,615 --> 00:54:10,333
Take these words to heart.

716
00:54:12,335 --> 00:54:14,485
To understand the living...

717
00:54:14,815 --> 00:54:17,283
...you got to commune with the dead.

718
00:54:20,615 --> 00:54:21,525
Now go!

719
00:54:21,775 --> 00:54:23,572
And don't you dare look back!

720
00:54:53,615 --> 00:54:54,968
On the grave...

721
00:54:55,335 --> 00:54:56,973
Who is Dr. Buzzard?

722
00:54:57,255 --> 00:54:59,211
Minerva was married to Dr. Buzzard...

723
00:54:59,455 --> 00:55:02,845
...the foremost voodoo practitioner
in Beaufort County.

724
00:55:03,095 --> 00:55:05,893
You may not know it,
but you are deep in voodoo country.

725
00:55:06,655 --> 00:55:08,964
I don't believe
in the hocus-pocus of it...

726
00:55:09,215 --> 00:55:11,604
...but the spiritual force behind it.

727
00:55:12,215 --> 00:55:15,013
The shiny dimes were easy...

728
00:55:15,255 --> 00:55:17,928
...but the virgin water
was a trick or two.

729
00:55:18,575 --> 00:55:21,453
How do you know she wouldn't know
the difference if it was tap water?

730
00:55:22,575 --> 00:55:24,406
Not by looking or taste...

731
00:55:24,655 --> 00:55:27,453
...but she would've known
in an instant by looking at my face.

732
00:55:32,575 --> 00:55:33,769
I think...

733
00:55:34,015 --> 00:55:36,813
...the photo-doctoring
is going to be good therapy.

734
00:55:38,935 --> 00:55:41,403
What about the pleas
for daily forgiveness?

735
00:55:42,655 --> 00:55:46,534
No, I don't think that's
going to be happening. Definitely not.

736
00:55:54,335 --> 00:55:55,848
- Thank you.
- Have a good day.

737
00:55:57,175 --> 00:55:58,574
- Hey, you.
- How are you?

738
00:55:58,815 --> 00:55:59,964
- How you doing?
- Good.

739
00:56:00,215 --> 00:56:01,170
You work here?

740
00:56:01,655 --> 00:56:03,327
What you see is what you get.

741
00:56:03,575 --> 00:56:04,803
Nothing wrong with that.

742
00:56:05,055 --> 00:56:06,568
Gee, thanks.

743
00:56:25,335 --> 00:56:26,563
These are nice.

744
00:56:27,015 --> 00:56:29,006
You want to send some flowers?

745
00:56:30,135 --> 00:56:32,285
I think so.
I don't know, though.

746
00:56:32,535 --> 00:56:34,014
It's kind of complicated.

747
00:56:34,615 --> 00:56:35,889
For whom?

748
00:56:36,815 --> 00:56:38,009
What's she like?

749
00:56:38,255 --> 00:56:40,007
I don't know her that well.

750
00:56:40,255 --> 00:56:41,449
Roses are a favorite.

751
00:56:41,695 --> 00:56:43,606
A bit presumptuous.

752
00:56:43,855 --> 00:56:45,174
How about...

753
00:56:45,415 --> 00:56:46,291
...poinsettias?

754
00:56:46,535 --> 00:56:48,844
Perennials might
give the wrong impression.

755
00:56:49,455 --> 00:56:52,413
- Too long-term?
- Yeah, it's hard to say.

756
00:56:52,655 --> 00:56:54,566
This is complicated.

757
00:56:55,375 --> 00:56:56,808
How about petunias?

758
00:56:57,055 --> 00:57:00,843
They're pretty without
being presumptuous, smell nice...

759
00:57:01,095 --> 00:57:02,926
...and in 3 days you throw them out.

760
00:57:03,615 --> 00:57:05,367
Sound like what you're looking for?

761
00:57:09,535 --> 00:57:11,765
Sorry, we're all out of petunias.

762
00:57:21,815 --> 00:57:23,931
Come on, get up, Lewis.
Get up.

763
00:57:26,975 --> 00:57:28,249
Get on up.

764
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:31,493
Good afternoon, Yankee John.

765
00:57:33,015 --> 00:57:35,768
That sounds like a dead battery.

766
00:57:40,655 --> 00:57:43,249
Woman that owns the tour company
rear-ended me...

767
00:57:43,495 --> 00:57:44,848
...so to speak.

768
00:57:45,095 --> 00:57:46,369
Where we headed?

769
00:57:48,615 --> 00:57:50,446
How about live entertainment?

770
00:57:51,695 --> 00:57:52,923
Get on up, Lewis.

771
00:57:53,175 --> 00:57:54,927
That's a good horse.

772
00:57:55,175 --> 00:57:56,403
<i>Hey, bitch!</i>

773
00:57:56,655 --> 00:57:57,974
Hey, bitch!

774
00:57:58,335 --> 00:58:02,123
Let the house say it like you mean it.
Let the house say, "Hey, bitch!"

775
00:58:02,375 --> 00:58:03,967
Hey, bitch!

776
00:58:04,655 --> 00:58:07,215
Yes, I am a bitch,
and proud of it, honey.

777
00:58:07,455 --> 00:58:11,494
Your mama is just sweating. I'm putting
a sweating in front of you white folks.

778
00:58:11,735 --> 00:58:16,365
But then again, I want you all to know
how hard a girl is working for you.

779
00:58:16,615 --> 00:58:18,685
Excuse me, darling.

780
00:58:19,695 --> 00:58:20,684
Excuse me.

781
00:58:20,935 --> 00:58:21,811
Oh, my God!

782
00:58:22,055 --> 00:58:25,684
"Oh, my God," nothing, honey.
"Oh, my empress" is what you should say.

783
00:58:25,935 --> 00:58:28,688
Y'all been necking
since I walked out on stage.

784
00:58:29,095 --> 00:58:33,373
Look, our Ivory Soap-using girl.
Love them kind of bitches, baby.

785
00:58:33,615 --> 00:58:37,210
Either he got some good old stuff,
girl, or you horny as hell.

786
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:42,211
Is this your boyfriend?
Your husband?

787
00:58:42,535 --> 00:58:43,763
My husband.

788
00:58:44,175 --> 00:58:45,972
What does Mr. Man do for a living?

789
00:58:46,455 --> 00:58:47,808
He's a doctor.

790
00:58:48,055 --> 00:58:49,044
A doctor?

791
00:58:49,295 --> 00:58:53,686
You better grow you some nails, because
if he's a gynecologist, he's mine.

792
00:58:54,415 --> 00:58:55,894
I am serious, honey.

793
00:58:57,055 --> 00:59:01,685
He is mine. A doctor. Grow your nails,
I'm going to take him away from you.

794
00:59:04,095 --> 00:59:07,371
Look at him just blushing.
You're so cute.

795
00:59:07,615 --> 00:59:09,446
You want to give me a physical?

796
00:59:11,535 --> 00:59:13,765
I have nothing to hide.

797
00:59:17,455 --> 00:59:19,810
You better have American Express, baby.

798
00:59:20,055 --> 00:59:22,250
But you know what?
That's okay about him.

799
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:25,214
Because the Doll has already got
some white boy...

800
00:59:25,455 --> 00:59:27,366
...running after her good old stuff.

801
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:30,846
Spotlight, shine a spotlight over there.
Right over there.

802
00:59:31,095 --> 00:59:34,246
You see that fine white man right there?
That one, there.

803
00:59:34,495 --> 00:59:38,807
He has been running the Doll
all around Savannah trying to get some.

804
00:59:39,055 --> 00:59:42,411
First day I met him,
he brought the girl roses.

805
00:59:42,655 --> 00:59:44,088
Then again, as you well know...

806
00:59:44,335 --> 00:59:46,610
...ain't nothing too good for the Doll.

807
00:59:46,855 --> 00:59:50,404
Ain't nothing too good for the Lady.
I am serious about that.

808
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:54,170
If I catch any of you bitches
near him, honey...

809
00:59:54,415 --> 00:59:58,090
...I want you to know you'll have
to deal with the Lady Chablis...

810
00:59:58,335 --> 01:00:01,691
...the Doll, the Grand Empress,
and my motherfucking ice pick.

811
01:00:02,295 --> 01:00:04,172
So keep your hands off of that one.

812
01:00:06,815 --> 01:00:07,964
Hey, honey love.

813
01:00:08,215 --> 01:00:09,330
How are you, Doll?

814
01:00:09,815 --> 01:00:12,170
I'm fine.
Who is that handsome man?

815
01:00:12,975 --> 01:00:13,851
Joe Odom.

816
01:00:14,055 --> 01:00:15,044
Pleased to meet you.

817
01:00:15,295 --> 01:00:18,492
My pleasure. We met before.
We slept together one night.

818
01:00:18,735 --> 01:00:23,251
Narrow it down for the Doll. There are
certain nights I cannot remember.

819
01:00:23,495 --> 01:00:25,247
That's another tale for another time.

820
01:00:26,255 --> 01:00:30,726
My ice cubes are getting a bit dry.
I'll leave you two alone. Ma'am.

821
01:00:30,975 --> 01:00:34,570
Thank you. I'll talk to you later,
you sentimental gentleman.

822
01:00:34,815 --> 01:00:35,850
Hurry back.

823
01:00:36,495 --> 01:00:39,089
Don't let him hurry back.
I need to spend time with you.

824
01:00:39,335 --> 01:00:40,211
How are you?

825
01:00:40,455 --> 01:00:44,414
I'm fine, honey. Still hiding my candy.
Want me to unwrap it for you?

826
01:00:44,655 --> 01:00:46,327
- You don't have to.
- You sure?

827
01:00:46,575 --> 01:00:47,803
Not yet.
I mean, not ever.

828
01:00:48,055 --> 01:00:49,727
- It's a small little wrapper.
- Please.

829
01:00:49,975 --> 01:00:51,124
Like a Tootsie Roll.

830
01:00:51,375 --> 01:00:52,854
Some people don't need to see candy.

831
01:00:54,215 --> 01:00:57,252
Okay, that's fine.
But I got something to tell you.

832
01:00:57,495 --> 01:01:02,125
I got something to tell you.
I have boyfriend number four.

833
01:01:02,375 --> 01:01:03,524
Really?

834
01:01:03,775 --> 01:01:07,131
A tall, blond hunk of a hunk of man.

835
01:01:07,375 --> 01:01:10,094
He's a mechanic on Abercorn Street.
Know where that is?

836
01:01:10,335 --> 01:01:13,407
- I know where that is.
- Treats me like a queen.

837
01:01:13,815 --> 01:01:15,567
No pun intended.
None whatsoever.

838
01:01:17,255 --> 01:01:20,725
You must promise if you
ever meet him, which I doubt you will...

839
01:01:20,975 --> 01:01:23,773
...if you should meet him,
you must never tell him my "T."

840
01:01:24,015 --> 01:01:25,528
- He has no idea.
- Your "T"?

841
01:01:25,775 --> 01:01:27,606
You know, my "T," my truth.

842
01:01:27,855 --> 01:01:29,413
The hide-my-candy thing.

843
01:01:29,935 --> 01:01:33,610
He doesn't know,
so you mustn't say anything.

844
01:01:34,375 --> 01:01:36,889
- Promise me you won't.
- Don't you think he'll find out?

845
01:01:37,135 --> 01:01:39,695
When I'm ready for him to find out,
he'll find out.

846
01:01:39,975 --> 01:01:41,693
Like when I was ready for you
to find out.

847
01:01:41,935 --> 01:01:43,687
But I wasn't looking for your candy.

848
01:01:43,935 --> 01:01:45,254
But you was smelling for it.

849
01:01:45,495 --> 01:01:48,089
- I did not smell your candy.
- Why are you here?

850
01:01:48,335 --> 01:01:49,529
I want to interview you.

851
01:01:50,215 --> 01:01:51,534
Your show was terrific.

852
01:01:51,775 --> 01:01:53,572
Thank you.
You want to interview me?

853
01:01:53,815 --> 01:01:55,328
Yes, very much so.

854
01:02:11,055 --> 01:02:11,965
What happened?

855
01:02:12,215 --> 01:02:14,206
9 jurors indicted murder one.

856
01:02:14,455 --> 01:02:16,810
They're trying to put our friend away
for life.

857
01:02:22,615 --> 01:02:23,730
Your Honor...

858
01:02:24,055 --> 01:02:26,967
...the community that put us both
in the positions we now hold...

859
01:02:27,215 --> 01:02:31,094
...would be less than pleased with
an order allowing a wealthy defendant...

860
01:02:31,335 --> 01:02:33,769
...in a first-degree murder case bail.

861
01:02:34,375 --> 01:02:35,854
And they'd be right.

862
01:02:39,855 --> 01:02:41,129
All right, gentlemen.

863
01:02:41,455 --> 01:02:44,447
I have listened carefully
to these arguments.

864
01:02:44,695 --> 01:02:49,086
Mr. Williams is charged
with a very violent crime...

865
01:02:49,335 --> 01:02:52,293
...and Mr. Seiler, I can't grant bail
under these circumstances.

866
01:02:53,975 --> 01:02:56,489
But I will put this case
on a fast track...

867
01:02:56,935 --> 01:02:58,163
...for a speedy trial.

868
01:02:58,455 --> 01:02:59,604
That's all.

869
01:03:12,055 --> 01:03:15,889
Well, sport, looks like there might be
a book in this after all.

870
01:03:22,495 --> 01:03:25,771
Does he have any idea
how serious this is?

871
01:03:26,015 --> 01:03:28,370
You know it and I know it...

872
01:03:29,535 --> 01:03:32,174
...and after tonight,
damn hell, so will he.

873
01:03:43,015 --> 01:03:43,891
What is it?

874
01:03:44,135 --> 01:03:47,764
You told Sonny I heard Billy
threaten you the night you shot him.

875
01:03:48,575 --> 01:03:50,930
I heard you threaten him too.
If I testify...

876
01:03:51,175 --> 01:03:52,164
I didn't threaten him.

877
01:03:52,415 --> 01:03:53,450
I warned him.

878
01:03:54,255 --> 01:03:57,133
He had a history of violence.
He was drunk and high.

879
01:03:57,455 --> 01:04:00,253
While trespassing,
he profanely demanded money...

880
01:04:00,495 --> 01:04:02,770
...and brandished
a broken bottle in my face.

881
01:04:03,015 --> 01:04:04,892
Is that not your recollection as well?

882
01:04:05,135 --> 01:04:08,525
- More or less.
- Then your testimony can only help me.

883
01:04:11,935 --> 01:04:14,051
What was it between the two of you?

884
01:04:17,695 --> 01:04:18,650
We'll turn this off.

885
01:04:19,735 --> 01:04:21,293
I don't mind that.

886
01:04:27,055 --> 01:04:28,534
Was it just sex?

887
01:04:29,095 --> 01:04:31,404
Tell me about the relationship.

888
01:04:36,895 --> 01:04:39,568
Billy and I had a bond.

889
01:04:39,815 --> 01:04:42,409
That's not something
they're going to understand.

890
01:04:43,495 --> 01:04:45,247
They'll just see the sex...

891
01:04:45,495 --> 01:04:47,247
...and the age difference.

892
01:04:48,815 --> 01:04:51,409
But Billy was going to make something
of himself.

893
01:04:53,135 --> 01:04:55,205
Great things, great people...

894
01:04:56,775 --> 01:04:59,448
...can come from humble beginnings.

895
01:04:59,695 --> 01:05:01,686
He needed what I gave him...

896
01:05:03,695 --> 01:05:05,686
...and I needed what he gave me.

897
01:05:08,255 --> 01:05:10,723
Now, do you wish
to pass judgement on that?

898
01:05:11,535 --> 01:05:12,604
No.

899
01:05:15,135 --> 01:05:16,614
I'm innocent, John.

900
01:05:17,855 --> 01:05:19,811
It's important that you believe that.

901
01:05:20,935 --> 01:05:22,527
Do you believe that?

902
01:05:24,655 --> 01:05:26,088
Yes, I do.

903
01:05:30,055 --> 01:05:32,774
I'm having trouble
getting anyone to talk to me.

904
01:05:34,575 --> 01:05:36,088
I'll make some arrangements.

905
01:05:36,335 --> 01:05:39,930
Tomorrow, can you bring the Sotheby's
and Christie's catalogues?

906
01:05:40,175 --> 01:05:43,565
They serve dinner here at 7,
so that's when we'll make our calls.

907
01:05:45,255 --> 01:05:46,574
Our calls?

908
01:05:55,695 --> 01:05:57,731
Yes, accept the charges, operator.

909
01:05:59,855 --> 01:06:01,732
Jim. How are you?

910
01:06:02,535 --> 01:06:05,208
All right, sport,
let's give this a try, shall we?

911
01:06:06,335 --> 01:06:08,087
Let's see if we can work this.

912
01:06:23,455 --> 01:06:24,774
All right, it's ringing.

913
01:06:27,055 --> 01:06:31,048
Hello, Jim Williams calling
for Geza von Habsburg.

914
01:06:32,055 --> 01:06:33,010
Thank you.

915
01:06:34,015 --> 01:06:34,970
Thank you.

916
01:06:39,095 --> 01:06:39,971
Geza.

917
01:06:40,495 --> 01:06:43,293
James! How nice of you to call.

918
01:06:43,535 --> 01:06:46,254
Would you be interested
in my Maximilian desk?

919
01:06:49,495 --> 01:06:51,087
Someone, ask him to be quiet.

920
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:58,328
It sounds like your dog
doesn't want to sell. What's his breed?

921
01:07:00,295 --> 01:07:02,570
That's a Russian wolfhound.

922
01:07:04,095 --> 01:07:05,653
Sounds more like a Shar-Pei.

923
01:07:06,295 --> 01:07:09,014
No, no, that's my Yorkie.

924
01:07:16,535 --> 01:07:18,969
Would someone please
put the dogs in the garden?

925
01:07:19,335 --> 01:07:21,565
I'll take care of the dog for you.

926
01:07:23,855 --> 01:07:27,052
Now, Geza,
you know I'll want top dollar.

927
01:07:27,575 --> 01:07:29,133
As always.

928
01:07:31,335 --> 01:07:32,370
Shut up!

929
01:08:14,815 --> 01:08:17,375
Is this the Married Women's Card Club?

930
01:08:17,895 --> 01:08:19,169
Yes.

931
01:08:21,935 --> 01:08:23,687
Is anyone going to ring the doorbell?

932
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:25,607
Oh, heavens, no!

933
01:08:25,855 --> 01:08:28,972
We have very strict rules.
The door opens precisely at 4.

934
01:08:33,335 --> 01:08:34,688
You all look lovely.

935
01:08:35,055 --> 01:08:36,408
Actually, Jim...

936
01:08:36,655 --> 01:08:39,533
...suggested
that I introduce you around.

937
01:08:39,775 --> 01:08:42,448
But if we could just keep that
between us...

938
01:08:43,455 --> 01:08:45,685
- Why?
- Just a minute.

939
01:08:46,535 --> 01:08:48,173
Everything all right, ladies?

940
01:08:48,935 --> 01:08:49,924
Good.

941
01:08:51,175 --> 01:08:53,530
Jim was a true friend to me
over the years.

942
01:08:53,775 --> 01:08:56,005
But most of these ladies
are still deciding...

943
01:08:56,255 --> 01:08:59,292
...how they'll respond
to this current predicament.

944
01:08:59,775 --> 01:09:00,924
You know...

945
01:09:01,175 --> 01:09:02,449
...the incident.

946
01:09:02,775 --> 01:09:05,972
I have work to do in the kitchen.
Would you like to take a seat?

947
01:09:06,215 --> 01:09:08,809
- I don't play bridge.
- Oh, I don't mean play.

948
01:09:09,095 --> 01:09:10,164
Men aren't allowed.

949
01:09:11,095 --> 01:09:12,767
Especially single men.

950
01:09:13,015 --> 01:09:16,052
But you could sit down and wait.
I'll be right back.

951
01:09:25,255 --> 01:09:28,008
It was a <i>crime passionnel.</i>
A lover's quarrel.

952
01:09:28,255 --> 01:09:31,452
That may be, but I gather
it's going to be rather sticky for Jim.

953
01:09:32,335 --> 01:09:33,290
Really?

954
01:09:33,695 --> 01:09:37,131
There's no gunpowder on that boy's hand.
He didn't fire the gun...

955
01:09:37,375 --> 01:09:38,967
...as Jim claims.

956
01:09:41,335 --> 01:09:43,849
And the location
of the bullet wounds...

957
01:09:44,095 --> 01:09:47,531
Seems to be at odds with
Mr. Williams' scenario of self-defense.

958
01:09:47,775 --> 01:09:48,605
How so?

959
01:09:48,855 --> 01:09:52,484
One entered the chest. The second
bullet hit the boy in the back.

960
01:09:52,735 --> 01:09:55,090
And the third, well,
the third bullet...

961
01:09:55,335 --> 01:09:56,893
What do you think'll happen to Jim?

962
01:09:58,815 --> 01:10:00,726
It's difficult to say.

963
01:10:01,015 --> 01:10:05,406
Those who are happy Billy is no longer
burning rubber through the squares...

964
01:10:05,695 --> 01:10:07,970
...are the exact people who think...

965
01:10:08,215 --> 01:10:12,970
...that Jim picked a very unseemly way
to exit the closet...

966
01:10:13,335 --> 01:10:14,450
...if you will.

967
01:10:15,015 --> 01:10:16,130
With a bang.

968
01:10:17,495 --> 01:10:18,928
Literally.

969
01:10:20,215 --> 01:10:21,170
And then...

970
01:10:21,415 --> 01:10:22,564
...there are the others.

971
01:10:23,135 --> 01:10:24,534
Tell me about the others.

972
01:10:25,375 --> 01:10:29,448
There's bound to be a certain
resentment about Jim killing that boy.

973
01:10:29,695 --> 01:10:32,289
That boy in particular, I mean.

974
01:10:33,015 --> 01:10:34,004
Why?

975
01:10:34,735 --> 01:10:37,772
Billy was a very accomplished hustler.

976
01:10:38,015 --> 01:10:40,813
By all accounts,
very good at his trade...

977
01:10:41,055 --> 01:10:45,048
...and very much appreciated
by both men and women.

978
01:10:46,735 --> 01:10:48,009
The trouble is...

979
01:10:48,255 --> 01:10:51,008
...he hadn't finished
making the rounds, no.

980
01:10:51,935 --> 01:10:54,130
Billy Hanson was known to be...

981
01:10:54,375 --> 01:10:55,888
...a good time...

982
01:10:56,135 --> 01:10:57,170
...but...

983
01:10:57,415 --> 01:11:00,805
...a good time not yet had by all.

984
01:11:01,255 --> 01:11:05,089
They're saying Jim Williams killed
the best piece of ass in Savannah.

985
01:11:05,335 --> 01:11:06,484
- Is that true?
- I don't know.

986
01:11:06,735 --> 01:11:08,930
You know about ass in Savannah.
What do you think?

987
01:11:09,175 --> 01:11:11,052
Great God!

988
01:11:11,775 --> 01:11:15,734
Good gossip's hard currency in this
town. Folks just paying their bills.

989
01:11:15,975 --> 01:11:20,287
When the chips are down,
they'll be there for Jim. Trust me.

990
01:11:20,535 --> 01:11:23,333
- Rather hear your legal strategies.
- Our game plan's still percolating.

991
01:11:23,575 --> 01:11:26,408
We had a deal.
I've shared every bit of information...

992
01:11:26,655 --> 01:11:27,974
Come along in.

993
01:11:28,215 --> 01:11:30,092
Now, don't mind us.

994
01:11:34,575 --> 01:11:35,690
Trial date.

995
01:11:36,095 --> 01:11:38,131
Big game 3 weeks from now.

996
01:11:38,375 --> 01:11:39,490
It's a shootout.

997
01:11:39,855 --> 01:11:42,050
Both teams got one silver bullet.

998
01:11:42,535 --> 01:11:45,368
Gunshot residue test, that's theirs.

999
01:11:45,815 --> 01:11:48,727
No gunshot residue on Billy's hands
means he didn't fire.

1000
01:11:48,975 --> 01:11:51,887
Means Jim killed him in cold blood...

1001
01:11:52,855 --> 01:11:54,208
...mocked up the scene.

1002
01:11:54,455 --> 01:11:56,093
How you plan to counter that?

1003
01:11:56,455 --> 01:12:01,085
Gunshot residue test is unreliable.
It's inadmissable in some jurisdictions.

1004
01:12:01,335 --> 01:12:04,771
Finley's got Doc Poe. We will counter
with cutting-edge science...

1005
01:12:05,015 --> 01:12:07,404
...with an expert we got from up north.

1006
01:12:09,255 --> 01:12:12,327
They say the scene was contrived.
What do you say?

1007
01:12:12,695 --> 01:12:14,128
That's our silver bullet.

1008
01:12:15,055 --> 01:12:16,727
Shoddy police work.

1009
01:12:16,975 --> 01:12:18,488
Take a look at this.

1010
01:12:25,095 --> 01:12:26,448
That's me!

1011
01:12:26,695 --> 01:12:28,048
Just like you said.

1012
01:12:28,295 --> 01:12:30,729
Ground zero.
Cops should never have let you in.

1013
01:12:31,855 --> 01:12:34,574
I kind of let myself in
through the back gate.

1014
01:12:35,855 --> 01:12:37,971
They shouldn't have let you get in.

1015
01:12:39,535 --> 01:12:41,810
<i>Happy together</i>

1016
01:12:42,615 --> 01:12:45,049
<i>Unhappy together</i>

1017
01:12:45,815 --> 01:12:48,010
<i>And won 't it be fine</i>

1018
01:12:53,095 --> 01:12:56,132
<i>Days may be cloudy or sunny</i>

1019
01:12:59,175 --> 01:13:02,804
<i>We're in or we're out of the money</i>

1020
01:13:06,935 --> 01:13:08,846
<i>But I'm with you always</i>

1021
01:13:10,895 --> 01:13:12,806
<i>Come rain or</i>

1022
01:13:14,775 --> 01:13:16,686
<i>Shine</i>

1023
01:13:27,335 --> 01:13:28,529
Joe Odom.

1024
01:13:32,295 --> 01:13:34,286
You're good.
I didn't know you sang.

1025
01:13:34,535 --> 01:13:35,888
- You never asked.
- How you doing?

1026
01:13:36,135 --> 01:13:37,363
Good, how are you?

1027
01:13:38,015 --> 01:13:41,212
- You got another set?
- No, me and Joe's just sitting in.

1028
01:13:41,455 --> 01:13:42,729
Want to get a cup of coffee?

1029
01:13:42,975 --> 01:13:44,727
Business or pleasure?

1030
01:13:45,095 --> 01:13:46,084
Come on.

1031
01:13:48,735 --> 01:13:53,286
Normally, there'd be no problem.
The general rule is rich people get off.

1032
01:13:53,535 --> 01:13:55,446
Problem is, they're usually straight.

1033
01:13:55,735 --> 01:13:57,805
See, so it's a volatile issue.

1034
01:13:58,055 --> 01:14:00,489
- I'm not crazy?
- No. Neither is Sonny.

1035
01:14:00,735 --> 01:14:02,532
Jim's friends knew he was gay.

1036
01:14:02,775 --> 01:14:06,563
Secretly, they congratulated themselves
on being so cosmopolitan.

1037
01:14:06,815 --> 01:14:11,525
If they knew he was completely open with
his sexuality, they'd have shunned him.

1038
01:14:11,975 --> 01:14:13,727
Maybe the jury will too.

1039
01:14:13,975 --> 01:14:14,851
You think?

1040
01:14:16,695 --> 01:14:19,846
Of course, no one'll ever really know
what happened that night.

1041
01:14:20,095 --> 01:14:22,848
But Jim's told the story
a thousand times, never wavered.

1042
01:14:23,095 --> 01:14:24,767
You're quite the advocate.

1043
01:14:25,015 --> 01:14:28,644
What happened to
"Stick around and stay objective"?

1044
01:14:28,895 --> 01:14:32,490
Objectively, it's looking like
they'll hang him for his sexuality.

1045
01:14:32,735 --> 01:14:35,329
Something that would never happen
in New York, right?

1046
01:14:36,695 --> 01:14:38,970
Well, you said it, not me.

1047
01:14:41,095 --> 01:14:42,767
You don't seem like you're from here.

1048
01:14:43,015 --> 01:14:45,449
I was born here, didn't like it...

1049
01:14:45,695 --> 01:14:46,810
...moved away.

1050
01:14:47,055 --> 01:14:49,125
Figured out the part
I didn't like was me.

1051
01:14:49,375 --> 01:14:52,173
So I worked on that,
and I moved back.

1052
01:14:54,175 --> 01:14:55,767
I got my first kiss right here.

1053
01:14:56,015 --> 01:14:58,449
Sammy Jenks.
Gave him a black eye.

1054
01:14:58,695 --> 01:15:00,413
You did? How hard?

1055
01:15:03,055 --> 01:15:04,488
That's what love'll do.

1056
01:15:04,975 --> 01:15:09,446
I have trouble picturing what kind of
woman you'd take the trouble to marry.

1057
01:15:12,855 --> 01:15:14,493
First love situation.

1058
01:15:15,135 --> 01:15:19,208
We got married a week after graduating
college, if you can believe that.

1059
01:15:19,455 --> 01:15:20,683
So what happened?

1060
01:15:20,935 --> 01:15:22,527
You want to hear my sob story?

1061
01:15:22,775 --> 01:15:26,006
I think she thought
she was marrying Norman Mailer.

1062
01:15:26,855 --> 01:15:28,527
She thought I'd be famous.

1063
01:15:29,095 --> 01:15:33,566
After the book was published, she'd wake
up at the crack of dawn on Sunday...

1064
01:15:33,815 --> 01:15:36,045
...make coffee, cross her fingers...

1065
01:15:36,295 --> 01:15:39,446
...and look in that Sunday <i>Times,</i>
sure it was going to be a bestseller.

1066
01:15:39,815 --> 01:15:43,854
One Sunday, she didn't wake up early,
didn't make coffee...

1067
01:15:44,095 --> 01:15:45,926
...didn't cross her fingers...

1068
01:15:47,095 --> 01:15:48,289
...and I knew.

1069
01:15:49,335 --> 01:15:52,008
She left you
because your book wasn't a hit?

1070
01:15:52,775 --> 01:15:56,245
I don't know, Kelso.
It seems pretty shallow to me.

1071
01:15:58,295 --> 01:15:59,967
What about you and Joe Odom?

1072
01:16:00,975 --> 01:16:02,374
Me and Joe.

1073
01:16:02,615 --> 01:16:04,253
We're just friends.

1074
01:16:04,615 --> 01:16:07,129
We have a real musical relationship.

1075
01:16:07,695 --> 01:16:10,892
We're like the Steve and Eydie
of Savannah.

1076
01:16:16,375 --> 01:16:18,127
My God, it's quiet.

1077
01:16:18,495 --> 01:16:19,405
Too quiet.

1078
01:16:19,655 --> 01:16:22,169
Joe'll be playing at that bar
until dawn.

1079
01:16:27,335 --> 01:16:28,768
I should probably go.

1080
01:16:34,975 --> 01:16:39,253
In case you're wondering,
this is the perfect time for a kiss.

1081
01:16:40,575 --> 01:16:42,645
Sammy Jenks warned me about you.

1082
01:17:02,175 --> 01:17:03,244
Good night.

1083
01:17:10,535 --> 01:17:14,164
Ladies and gentlemen,
you constitute our jury for this trial.

1084
01:17:14,415 --> 01:17:16,167
It's expected to last several days.

1085
01:17:16,415 --> 01:17:18,087
I'll let you go home for the evening...

1086
01:17:18,335 --> 01:17:22,374
...instruct you to be back
in the morning at 9:30 in the jury room.

1087
01:17:22,615 --> 01:17:25,368
If anybody tries to approach you
about this case...

1088
01:17:25,615 --> 01:17:28,083
...report it to me
the first thing in the morning.

1089
01:17:28,655 --> 01:17:30,532
You're excused for the evening.

1090
01:17:33,415 --> 01:17:35,929
Mr. Driggers, let me speak to you.

1091
01:17:41,615 --> 01:17:43,287
Luther, listen.

1092
01:17:43,535 --> 01:17:46,845
This is a courtroom. Don't bring
those flies in here tomorrow.

1093
01:17:47,175 --> 01:17:51,805
And leave that vial of water,
or whatever that stuff is, at home.

1094
01:17:52,415 --> 01:17:53,564
Sam...

1095
01:17:53,895 --> 01:17:57,888
...you know, when we were in Georgia,
I know how you hated my bugs...

1096
01:17:58,135 --> 01:17:59,853
...and you know how I love them.

1097
01:18:00,455 --> 01:18:02,810
We're no longer at the university.
This is a courtroom.

1098
01:18:03,055 --> 01:18:06,525
I'm telling you to leave
all that foolishness at home.

1099
01:18:07,535 --> 01:18:09,571
I do take umbrage.

1100
01:18:10,055 --> 01:18:11,534
But I'll do it.

1101
01:18:12,655 --> 01:18:15,215
What is the story with the guy
with the horsefly epaulets?

1102
01:18:15,455 --> 01:18:16,888
Luther Driggers.

1103
01:18:17,135 --> 01:18:18,329
He's a genius.

1104
01:18:18,575 --> 01:18:20,566
Developed the "No-Bug" strip.

1105
01:18:20,815 --> 01:18:23,568
The company he worked for
took the credit and the money.

1106
01:18:23,815 --> 01:18:26,966
Now he just wanders around town
with a bottle of poison in his pocket.

1107
01:18:27,215 --> 01:18:28,091
Of course.

1108
01:18:28,335 --> 01:18:32,010
Says someday he's going to put it
in the water supply, do us all in.

1109
01:18:32,255 --> 01:18:33,927
Why do you want him on the jury?

1110
01:18:34,175 --> 01:18:37,212
We're the defense team.
We need all the nuts we can get.

1111
01:18:37,455 --> 01:18:38,854
What about Largent?

1112
01:18:39,175 --> 01:18:41,245
Finley's up for reelection.

1113
01:18:41,615 --> 01:18:42,889
If he strikes Luther...

1114
01:18:43,135 --> 01:18:44,773
...he might upset him enough to...

1115
01:18:45,615 --> 01:18:46,570
...you know...

1116
01:18:48,655 --> 01:18:50,566
I'll be back in on Sunday.

1117
01:18:51,335 --> 01:18:54,566
You've got a murder trial
starting in 3 days. Where you going?

1118
01:18:56,815 --> 01:18:58,851
Home opener against 'Bama.

1119
01:19:00,775 --> 01:19:02,208
Go, Dogs!

1120
01:19:05,055 --> 01:19:06,010
Is he really leaving?

1121
01:19:06,255 --> 01:19:07,973
Oh, yeah.
Better say a prayer.

1122
01:19:10,175 --> 01:19:11,449
All right, Mr. Largent...

1123
01:19:11,695 --> 01:19:15,131
...the state has the burden of proof,
and you have the opening.

1124
01:19:18,215 --> 01:19:19,284
Your Honor.

1125
01:19:22,655 --> 01:19:25,408
Good morning, Your Honor,
ladies and gentlemen of the jury.

1126
01:19:27,295 --> 01:19:30,685
The state of Georgia is ready
and most anxious to proceed.

1127
01:19:40,255 --> 01:19:41,893
If the court pleases.

1128
01:19:53,735 --> 01:19:56,090
The philosopher Thomas Hobbes
is quoted as saying...

1129
01:19:56,335 --> 01:19:57,734
...that life is...

1130
01:19:57,975 --> 01:19:59,806
...nasty, brutish...

1131
01:20:00,415 --> 01:20:01,609
...and short.

1132
01:20:03,335 --> 01:20:06,532
And surely it must have seemed so
to Billy Hanson...

1133
01:20:07,295 --> 01:20:09,047
...as he lay wounded...

1134
01:20:09,415 --> 01:20:11,724
...his blood and his life...

1135
01:20:11,975 --> 01:20:15,172
...oozing out
onto Jim Williams' Persian rug.

1136
01:20:17,415 --> 01:20:20,134
It's important for you to know
that the defendant...

1137
01:20:22,455 --> 01:20:24,207
By the end of this trial...

1138
01:20:24,735 --> 01:20:25,724
...I believe...

1139
01:20:26,455 --> 01:20:29,174
...that when faced with the evidence...

1140
01:20:29,695 --> 01:20:30,889
...you will render...

1141
01:20:31,135 --> 01:20:33,968
...the verdict that is fair and just:

1142
01:20:36,575 --> 01:20:38,770
Guilty of first-degree murder.

1143
01:20:44,055 --> 01:20:45,090
Thank you.

1144
01:20:54,295 --> 01:20:58,493
All right, Mr. Seiler,
we've been going for some time now.

1145
01:20:58,735 --> 01:21:02,250
Would you prefer to make
your opening statement after recess?

1146
01:21:05,335 --> 01:21:08,566
I would prefer to address
the jury now, Your Honor.

1147
01:21:11,415 --> 01:21:13,531
What I have to say won't take long.

1148
01:21:17,295 --> 01:21:19,331
I apologize if I look tired...

1149
01:21:20,615 --> 01:21:22,412
...if my eyes are red...

1150
01:21:23,135 --> 01:21:25,205
...if my complexion is sallow.

1151
01:21:25,975 --> 01:21:28,045
But I came by it honestly.

1152
01:21:29,135 --> 01:21:30,363
Because...

1153
01:21:30,615 --> 01:21:32,810
...I have not had much sleep lately.

1154
01:21:33,335 --> 01:21:35,610
For while my bed is soft...

1155
01:21:36,455 --> 01:21:38,650
...my client's is not.

1156
01:21:39,255 --> 01:21:42,531
And while I'm surrounded
by my loving family...

1157
01:21:43,495 --> 01:21:45,008
...Jim Williams...

1158
01:21:45,775 --> 01:21:47,094
...my friend...

1159
01:21:47,695 --> 01:21:48,923
...my client...

1160
01:21:50,215 --> 01:21:51,728
...is locked up in a room...

1161
01:21:51,975 --> 01:21:55,251
...full of thieves,
murderers and rapists.

1162
01:21:58,495 --> 01:22:00,008
You're the ones I want.

1163
01:22:00,895 --> 01:22:02,886
You're the ones I trust.

1164
01:22:04,255 --> 01:22:08,407
Because although it is Jim Williams
on trial here today...

1165
01:22:08,855 --> 01:22:11,369
...when I look at the circumstances...

1166
01:22:11,695 --> 01:22:13,367
...I think to myself...

1167
01:22:13,735 --> 01:22:14,690
...there...

1168
01:22:14,935 --> 01:22:17,733
...but for the grace of God,
go you...

1169
01:22:18,095 --> 01:22:19,050
...or I.

1170
01:22:19,735 --> 01:22:22,488
You know why?
Because I guaran-damn-tee you:

1171
01:22:22,735 --> 01:22:25,693
Someone comes into my home
and shoot at me, I will shoot back.

1172
01:22:25,935 --> 01:22:28,130
And I'll shoot back again and again...

1173
01:22:28,375 --> 01:22:30,889
...and again,
until I'm sure that they're dead.

1174
01:22:31,135 --> 01:22:35,367
Until I'm sure that my home
and my family are safe.

1175
01:22:39,855 --> 01:22:41,004
And then...

1176
01:22:41,775 --> 01:22:43,686
...old Finley here, my friend...

1177
01:22:44,335 --> 01:22:46,246
...would be prosecuting me.

1178
01:22:46,615 --> 01:22:48,412
I'd be the one on trial.

1179
01:22:48,975 --> 01:22:50,374
And my life...

1180
01:22:50,615 --> 01:22:52,014
...would be in the hands...

1181
01:22:52,655 --> 01:22:54,930
...of good folks like you.

1182
01:22:55,055 --> 01:22:57,091
He is way out-of-bounds.

1183
01:22:57,615 --> 01:23:01,449
He didn't object once during ours.
We'll look like assholes.

1184
01:23:01,695 --> 01:23:03,606
Folks not swayed by fancy words.

1185
01:23:04,295 --> 01:23:06,604
Folks who would not be prejudiced...

1186
01:23:07,695 --> 01:23:09,970
...who would not judge a man...

1187
01:23:10,215 --> 01:23:12,126
...by the color of his skin...

1188
01:23:12,735 --> 01:23:14,885
...or the amount of money that he makes.

1189
01:23:15,255 --> 01:23:16,404
I will say...

1190
01:23:17,015 --> 01:23:19,006
...the simple fact of the matter...

1191
01:23:19,255 --> 01:23:20,370
...is...

1192
01:23:21,175 --> 01:23:22,847
...Jim Williams...

1193
01:23:23,775 --> 01:23:25,766
...murdered no one.

1194
01:23:29,895 --> 01:23:32,489
How did you think it went?
Because I was very pleased.

1195
01:23:32,735 --> 01:23:35,693
Sonny has a certain style,
a flair, doesn't he?

1196
01:23:35,935 --> 01:23:37,084
From what I've seen...

1197
01:23:37,335 --> 01:23:40,213
...that man could weave horseshit
into Egyptian cotton.

1198
01:23:40,615 --> 01:23:42,571
Pleasantly surprised.

1199
01:23:43,615 --> 01:23:45,810
John Kelso,
I hope you understand.

1200
01:23:46,215 --> 01:23:48,046
Might I consider you my friend?

1201
01:23:49,615 --> 01:23:50,650
Yes.

1202
01:23:54,535 --> 01:23:58,369
The lack of gunshot residue in the hand,
plus the other things I mentioned...

1203
01:23:58,615 --> 01:24:01,368
...led me to the conclusion
that the scene was contrived.

1204
01:24:03,695 --> 01:24:05,413
Thank you, Detective Boone.

1205
01:24:05,655 --> 01:24:07,134
No further questions.

1206
01:24:09,735 --> 01:24:11,134
Detective...

1207
01:24:12,535 --> 01:24:15,732
...I'd like to revisit
some of the things...

1208
01:24:16,335 --> 01:24:18,849
...you said just then in direct.

1209
01:24:22,015 --> 01:24:25,849
You testified there was blood
on Hanson's hand, correct?

1210
01:24:26,095 --> 01:24:29,405
Yes. There was blood in the palm
of the victim's hand.

1211
01:24:29,895 --> 01:24:33,171
And that's important because if Hanson
had been holding the gun...

1212
01:24:33,415 --> 01:24:34,734
...there'd be no blood.

1213
01:24:36,855 --> 01:24:40,291
But you never saw the blood
on the victim's hand, did you?

1214
01:24:40,655 --> 01:24:41,610
No.

1215
01:24:42,615 --> 01:24:45,004
The blood was noted
in the autopsy report.

1216
01:24:45,255 --> 01:24:47,610
I didn't turn them over
when I bagged them.

1217
01:24:48,295 --> 01:24:50,650
I believe you also testified that...

1218
01:24:50,895 --> 01:24:55,571
...you believe the final shot was fired
from above the victim, is that correct?

1219
01:24:56,335 --> 01:25:00,328
I concluded that the shot came
from someone standing over the victim...

1220
01:25:00,655 --> 01:25:01,974
...execution style.

1221
01:25:04,455 --> 01:25:05,968
A <i>coup de grâce.</i>

1222
01:25:06,575 --> 01:25:08,008
A <i>coup de grâce</i>?

1223
01:25:15,375 --> 01:25:17,650
Will you tell the jury, please...

1224
01:25:18,615 --> 01:25:22,449
...did you find Jim's prints
on Billy's gun?

1225
01:25:26,095 --> 01:25:29,246
The Luger handle has a textured surface.

1226
01:25:30,855 --> 01:25:32,891
Is the answer no, Detective?

1227
01:25:33,855 --> 01:25:36,415
Yes, the answer was no.

1228
01:25:36,655 --> 01:25:38,532
Yes, the answer is no.

1229
01:25:39,935 --> 01:25:41,926
State's 22, Your Honor.

1230
01:25:45,935 --> 01:25:47,846
Who's this handsome fellow?

1231
01:25:48,135 --> 01:25:49,090
That's me.

1232
01:25:52,055 --> 01:25:53,568
Who's this?

1233
01:25:55,015 --> 01:25:57,575
That's that reporter fella
from up north.

1234
01:25:57,815 --> 01:26:00,045
The one that's working with Williams.

1235
01:26:00,655 --> 01:26:02,373
I don't know how he got in.

1236
01:26:02,815 --> 01:26:04,168
And this?

1237
01:26:04,975 --> 01:26:06,328
Young officer...

1238
01:26:06,575 --> 01:26:07,974
...name escapes me.

1239
01:26:08,215 --> 01:26:12,766
Understandable. You'd need a program
to keep track of everyone in that room.

1240
01:26:13,015 --> 01:26:14,209
Objection!

1241
01:26:14,455 --> 01:26:16,252
Counsel's testifying.

1242
01:26:16,655 --> 01:26:17,974
Strike that.

1243
01:26:18,615 --> 01:26:21,209
I would much rather have
the detective tell us.

1244
01:26:21,535 --> 01:26:23,890
How many people was in that room?

1245
01:26:25,255 --> 01:26:26,449
Seven.

1246
01:26:27,335 --> 01:26:28,324
No, eight.

1247
01:26:28,575 --> 01:26:31,647
"Seven, no, eight."
And a pussycat.

1248
01:26:34,855 --> 01:26:36,607
Read the funny papers, Detective?

1249
01:26:37,255 --> 01:26:38,574
Not often.

1250
01:26:39,175 --> 01:26:42,133
In the funny papers they sometimes
have this little competition...

1251
01:26:42,375 --> 01:26:44,570
...to find an animal
hidden in an illustration.

1252
01:26:44,815 --> 01:26:47,534
I love to play it with my grandson.
You know that game?

1253
01:26:49,255 --> 01:26:51,610
We're going to play "Where's Shelton?"

1254
01:26:51,855 --> 01:26:56,565
I don't know what Mr. Seiler's trying
to prove with all this, but I assume...

1255
01:26:57,135 --> 01:27:00,366
Mr. Finley, we can all play.
Shelton Williams...

1256
01:27:00,615 --> 01:27:02,651
...is the defendant's tabby cat.

1257
01:27:04,015 --> 01:27:05,573
Now, Detective...

1258
01:27:06,535 --> 01:27:08,332
...let's play "Where's Shelton?"

1259
01:27:11,135 --> 01:27:12,534
I'll give you a clue.

1260
01:27:14,175 --> 01:27:15,927
Take a look at the rug.

1261
01:27:20,716 --> 01:27:22,946
Is the answer "yes"?

1262
01:27:24,956 --> 01:27:26,912
State's 22, Your Honor.

1263
01:27:28,596 --> 01:27:29,745
Tabby cat.

1264
01:27:30,396 --> 01:27:32,751
Is Shelton Williams on your payroll?

1265
01:27:36,516 --> 01:27:38,746
I've heard tell of cat burglars.

1266
01:27:38,996 --> 01:27:40,395
Is this a cat detective?

1267
01:27:42,116 --> 01:27:43,788
Don't be ridiculous.

1268
01:27:44,036 --> 01:27:45,833
I'll tell you what's ridiculous.

1269
01:27:46,076 --> 01:27:49,034
You saying that
the scene of the crime was secured.

1270
01:27:49,436 --> 01:27:50,869
That's what's ridiculous.

1271
01:27:51,876 --> 01:27:56,313
Seven, no, eight people, and a pussycat,
walking all around that room...

1272
01:27:58,436 --> 01:28:00,154
You call that secure?

1273
01:28:09,516 --> 01:28:11,188
We hung around a lot.

1274
01:28:11,796 --> 01:28:14,833
Billy had a car
and he'd give me rides sometimes.

1275
01:28:16,756 --> 01:28:19,668
Mr. Tucker, do you,
of your own knowledge...

1276
01:28:19,916 --> 01:28:23,829
...know anything of the relationship
between Billy Hanson and...

1277
01:28:24,076 --> 01:28:25,270
...Jim Williams?

1278
01:28:25,516 --> 01:28:26,631
Objection.

1279
01:28:26,876 --> 01:28:28,150
Objection, Your Honor.

1280
01:28:31,836 --> 01:28:34,111
Let me see you gentlemen
over here a minute.

1281
01:28:40,316 --> 01:28:41,715
What's this about?

1282
01:28:42,556 --> 01:28:46,231
Your Honor, if this boy says
what I think he's going to say...

1283
01:28:46,476 --> 01:28:48,228
...you can't ask the jury to ignore it.

1284
01:28:48,476 --> 01:28:52,071
You can't let a skunk go in the box
and then say they didn't smell it.

1285
01:28:52,316 --> 01:28:56,514
Our intention with Mr. Tucker is to show
the victim was afraid of the defendant.

1286
01:28:56,756 --> 01:29:00,385
To do that, he has to describe
the nature of the relationship.

1287
01:29:00,636 --> 01:29:04,151
Your intention
is to paint Jim Williams pink...

1288
01:29:04,396 --> 01:29:06,785
...then rely on some prejudice
in the jury.

1289
01:29:07,036 --> 01:29:09,948
Besides which, whatever he says
will be secondhand.

1290
01:29:10,196 --> 01:29:11,629
It would be hearsay.

1291
01:29:12,556 --> 01:29:15,548
He asked the witness
if he knew of his own knowledge.

1292
01:29:15,796 --> 01:29:18,151
If he knows, it's not hearsay.

1293
01:29:18,996 --> 01:29:20,031
I'll allow it...

1294
01:29:20,396 --> 01:29:23,194
...but I'll grant you the same latitude
when it's your turn.

1295
01:29:23,436 --> 01:29:24,949
Objection's overruled.

1296
01:29:32,716 --> 01:29:36,595
Mr. Tucker, the question was,
"Do you, of your own knowledge...

1297
01:29:36,836 --> 01:29:41,148
...know anything of the relationship
between Hanson and the defendant?"

1298
01:29:41,796 --> 01:29:42,831
Yes, sir.

1299
01:29:43,796 --> 01:29:46,310
Jim would give Billy money
when he needed it.

1300
01:29:46,556 --> 01:29:50,469
He bought him a car and clothes
for going to bed with him.

1301
01:29:52,076 --> 01:29:54,385
To sleep with him?
To...

1302
01:29:55,116 --> 01:29:56,515
...have sex with him?

1303
01:29:57,196 --> 01:29:58,231
Yes, sir.

1304
01:30:02,476 --> 01:30:04,387
Now, did Billy and Jim Williams...

1305
01:30:04,636 --> 01:30:05,910
...have any disagreements...

1306
01:30:06,156 --> 01:30:07,271
...if you know?

1307
01:30:08,476 --> 01:30:09,829
All the time.

1308
01:30:10,236 --> 01:30:12,796
Jim would be pissed off at Billy...

1309
01:30:13,036 --> 01:30:14,833
...for one thing or another.

1310
01:30:15,516 --> 01:30:17,188
He was real jealous of Billy.

1311
01:30:19,196 --> 01:30:21,915
And what feelings, if any...

1312
01:30:22,156 --> 01:30:25,114
...did Billy have about the defendant?

1313
01:30:26,556 --> 01:30:29,195
Jim is a rich and powerful man.

1314
01:30:30,036 --> 01:30:32,311
Billy was a little afraid of him,
I guess.

1315
01:30:36,676 --> 01:30:37,745
Thank you.

1316
01:30:55,116 --> 01:30:56,595
Minerva.

1317
01:30:59,796 --> 01:31:00,785
Tell me...

1318
01:31:01,596 --> 01:31:04,110
...how well did you know Billy Hanson?

1319
01:31:05,316 --> 01:31:06,908
What kind of friends were you?

1320
01:31:07,916 --> 01:31:09,235
Yes, sir.

1321
01:31:09,476 --> 01:31:11,467
He was my best friend in the world.

1322
01:31:12,276 --> 01:31:14,107
We saw each other all the time.

1323
01:31:14,876 --> 01:31:16,309
There's nothing he wouldn't do for me.

1324
01:31:16,556 --> 01:31:18,831
And nothing you wouldn't do for him.

1325
01:31:19,596 --> 01:31:22,110
If you're trying to say I'm lying,
I'm not.

1326
01:31:22,916 --> 01:31:24,747
Take it easy, young man.

1327
01:31:24,996 --> 01:31:26,714
Everything I say is true.

1328
01:31:26,956 --> 01:31:30,426
Of course. There's no reason for it
not to be. That's all we're after here.

1329
01:31:33,316 --> 01:31:37,628
How well did you know Jim Williams?
You never did meet him, did you?

1330
01:31:38,556 --> 01:31:40,387
Not shaking hands or nothing.

1331
01:31:41,356 --> 01:31:45,190
But I stood next to him in the emergency
room when Billy O.D.'d.

1332
01:31:45,556 --> 01:31:46,784
Billy Hanson...

1333
01:31:47,036 --> 01:31:48,674
...overdosed on drugs?

1334
01:31:51,316 --> 01:31:52,351
When?

1335
01:31:54,836 --> 01:31:56,667
About a month before Jim killed him.

1336
01:32:00,036 --> 01:32:01,469
So Jim Williams...

1337
01:32:01,716 --> 01:32:04,788
...took Billy Hanson to the hospital.
He saved his life.

1338
01:32:05,036 --> 01:32:06,549
If he wanted him dead...

1339
01:32:06,796 --> 01:32:08,514
...why would he do that?

1340
01:32:09,156 --> 01:32:10,509
I don't know.

1341
01:32:12,036 --> 01:32:13,469
I guess...

1342
01:32:14,276 --> 01:32:15,470
Did you...

1343
01:32:16,036 --> 01:32:17,788
...ever have sex with Billy?

1344
01:32:18,516 --> 01:32:20,427
No. No, sir.

1345
01:32:25,236 --> 01:32:27,227
Are you yourself a homosexual?

1346
01:32:28,956 --> 01:32:30,071
Objection.

1347
01:32:32,156 --> 01:32:33,111
Relevance?

1348
01:32:33,996 --> 01:32:35,987
Mr. Largent, you opened that door.

1349
01:32:36,396 --> 01:32:38,512
What's good for the goose
is good for the gander.

1350
01:32:38,756 --> 01:32:39,825
I'll let it in.

1351
01:32:41,636 --> 01:32:43,115
Thank you, Your Honor.

1352
01:32:45,876 --> 01:32:47,867
Want me to repeat the question, George?

1353
01:32:48,116 --> 01:32:51,028
I could have the court reporter
read it out.

1354
01:32:51,276 --> 01:32:53,107
No, sir. I ain't no fairy.

1355
01:33:00,556 --> 01:33:03,195
I've had some experiences, but...

1356
01:33:04,076 --> 01:33:05,634
...I'm out of it now.

1357
01:33:06,676 --> 01:33:07,825
Out of it?

1358
01:33:08,076 --> 01:33:09,191
Yes, sir.

1359
01:33:10,196 --> 01:33:13,427
Would you care to explain to the jury
what you mean by that?

1360
01:33:14,716 --> 01:33:15,785
It's wrong.

1361
01:33:16,156 --> 01:33:17,350
The Bible says so.

1362
01:33:19,356 --> 01:33:21,472
Bible also says
it's wrong to lie.

1363
01:33:23,516 --> 01:33:26,474
How long have you been out of it?

1364
01:33:29,876 --> 01:33:31,628
Almost 3 weeks.

1365
01:33:35,156 --> 01:33:36,908
Congratulations, George.

1366
01:33:38,676 --> 01:33:39,665
Good for you.

1367
01:33:44,756 --> 01:33:46,747
No further questions, Your Honor.

1368
01:33:55,516 --> 01:33:58,030
- Please.
- Chablis, it's a subpoena!

1369
01:33:58,276 --> 01:33:59,789
They'll hold you in contempt.

1370
01:34:00,036 --> 01:34:04,507
I don't care if it's an invitation
from God. They fuck with the Doll...

1371
01:34:04,756 --> 01:34:06,553
- You got that off TV.
- Whatever.

1372
01:34:06,796 --> 01:34:08,309
They'll hold you in contempt.

1373
01:34:08,556 --> 01:34:10,911
I've been held in contempt before.

1374
01:34:11,156 --> 01:34:12,475
A man's life is at stake.

1375
01:34:12,716 --> 01:34:16,470
What do I have to do
with that man's life? Nothing.

1376
01:34:16,716 --> 01:34:17,865
Absolutely nothing.

1377
01:34:18,116 --> 01:34:20,869
Wait. I'll tell you what.
I'll make you a deal.

1378
01:34:21,116 --> 01:34:22,708
What kind of deal?

1379
01:34:24,636 --> 01:34:25,864
What kind of deal?

1380
01:34:26,636 --> 01:34:28,752
Wait, John, be patient.

1381
01:34:30,396 --> 01:34:31,829
I'll tell you what.

1382
01:34:32,076 --> 01:34:35,785
You bring me a truckload of
good-Iooking boys to my show tonight...

1383
01:34:36,036 --> 01:34:37,469
...and I'll think about it.

1384
01:34:37,716 --> 01:34:40,594
I'd love to, but I can't.
I got to go to some cotillion.

1385
01:34:41,036 --> 01:34:44,108
How boring.
What cotillion are you going to?

1386
01:34:44,356 --> 01:34:45,550
The Alpha Phi.

1387
01:34:46,236 --> 01:34:47,794
The black people's ball?

1388
01:34:48,036 --> 01:34:50,391
You're going to the black people's ball?

1389
01:34:53,516 --> 01:34:55,905
- Absolutely not.
- Please? Take me.

1390
01:34:56,156 --> 01:34:57,669
I'll be on my best behavior.

1391
01:34:57,916 --> 01:35:00,988
I promise, John.
Please take me.

1392
01:35:01,236 --> 01:35:02,669
- I can't.
- I won't shake my ass or cuss.

1393
01:35:02,916 --> 01:35:04,235
I won't do anything.
Please.

1394
01:35:04,476 --> 01:35:05,829
These girls are debutantes.

1395
01:35:06,076 --> 01:35:09,989
What does that mean? I can't clientele
with uptown black-ass people?

1396
01:35:10,236 --> 01:35:13,148
No, but, you know,
debs are carefully scrutinized.

1397
01:35:14,676 --> 01:35:16,553
Please. And?

1398
01:35:17,876 --> 01:35:19,434
For the most part...

1399
01:35:20,756 --> 01:35:22,712
...not many of them hide their candy...

1400
01:35:23,116 --> 01:35:25,266
...and few have been caught shoplifting.

1401
01:35:26,396 --> 01:35:27,829
You know, not many.

1402
01:35:28,836 --> 01:35:32,875
These bitches must do it damn good,
if they haven't gotten caught yet.

1403
01:35:33,116 --> 01:35:35,676
I imagine they do
a lot of volunteer work, Frank.

1404
01:35:35,916 --> 01:35:38,908
Stay out of bars, go to churches.
Those kind of ladies.

1405
01:35:39,156 --> 01:35:43,069
First of all,
don't you ever call me Frank again.

1406
01:35:43,356 --> 01:35:46,428
And are these black girls
we're talking about?

1407
01:35:46,676 --> 01:35:50,669
If these are black girls,
they must be some ugly bitches, honey.

1408
01:35:51,196 --> 01:35:52,185
Take me.

1409
01:35:52,436 --> 01:35:53,869
- Please?
- Come on.

1410
01:35:54,116 --> 01:35:54,946
Take me.

1411
01:35:55,196 --> 01:35:56,993
- Cut it out.
- Please take me.

1412
01:36:28,436 --> 01:36:30,506
It's good to have you here.

1413
01:36:30,756 --> 01:36:32,633
You know, this is our 40th year.

1414
01:36:32,876 --> 01:36:33,865
It's lovely.

1415
01:36:39,596 --> 01:36:43,509
I do believe
we've almost caught the white cotillion.

1416
01:36:45,676 --> 01:36:47,155
Congratulations.

1417
01:37:31,636 --> 01:37:32,591
Good evening.

1418
01:37:34,556 --> 01:37:36,353
Sir, is this spot taken?

1419
01:37:36,596 --> 01:37:39,064
- No, ma'am.
- Please don't call me ma'am.

1420
01:37:39,316 --> 01:37:40,988
My name's Chablis.
What's yours?

1421
01:37:41,236 --> 01:37:42,828
Phillip. I'm an escort.

1422
01:37:43,836 --> 01:37:44,871
An escort.

1423
01:37:45,116 --> 01:37:47,266
Do you work for a service?

1424
01:37:47,516 --> 01:37:48,869
No, I'm escorting my sister.

1425
01:37:49,116 --> 01:37:51,027
Don't tell me you're doing it with her.

1426
01:37:52,636 --> 01:37:56,151
My sister's boyfriend decided
not to come, so I got roped into it.

1427
01:37:57,756 --> 01:37:59,030
Let me ask you something.

1428
01:38:00,956 --> 01:38:02,674
You ever been arrested?

1429
01:38:03,276 --> 01:38:04,391
Oh, come on.

1430
01:38:04,636 --> 01:38:05,864
Once, sort of.

1431
01:38:06,196 --> 01:38:09,347
I had a few drinks.
I got a ticket for disturbing the peace.

1432
01:38:10,036 --> 01:38:12,186
Disturbing the peace.

1433
01:38:13,076 --> 01:38:15,271
I got a piece you can disturb, hon.

1434
01:38:18,196 --> 01:38:20,152
I've been admiring your gown.

1435
01:38:20,436 --> 01:38:22,870
Thank you very much.
This old thing?

1436
01:38:23,116 --> 01:38:24,913
It's very glamorous.

1437
01:38:25,156 --> 01:38:26,874
Thank you very much.

1438
01:38:27,116 --> 01:38:28,708
Of whom are you a guest?

1439
01:38:29,156 --> 01:38:30,555
I'm here with my cousin.

1440
01:38:35,076 --> 01:38:35,986
My cousin...

1441
01:38:37,076 --> 01:38:38,350
...LaVella.

1442
01:38:38,836 --> 01:38:39,951
LaVella.

1443
01:38:40,516 --> 01:38:42,313
She's a lovely girl.

1444
01:38:42,556 --> 01:38:46,185
Oh, I think so too.
She's always wanted this...

1445
01:38:46,436 --> 01:38:49,906
...since we were kids.
She never thought she'd get it.

1446
01:38:50,156 --> 01:38:52,954
She had nothing to worry about.

1447
01:38:53,476 --> 01:38:56,229
You know what, hon?
I told her the same thing.

1448
01:38:56,476 --> 01:38:59,627
If Vanessa Williams can pull one off
on the Miss America committee...

1449
01:38:59,876 --> 01:39:02,948
...then her little whoring around
in Atlanta, Georgia...

1450
01:39:03,196 --> 01:39:07,906
...was not going to mean anything to
a little steering committee in Savannah.

1451
01:39:08,436 --> 01:39:10,267
And she got it.
I'm so happy for her.

1452
01:39:12,116 --> 01:39:13,549
Would you watch my purse?

1453
01:39:15,196 --> 01:39:17,312
Phillip and I are going to go
disturb the peace.

1454
01:39:17,556 --> 01:39:18,830
What do you think?

1455
01:39:19,076 --> 01:39:21,465
Let's go disturb some peace.
Come on.

1456
01:40:19,596 --> 01:40:20,824
Oh, Jesus!

1457
01:40:26,916 --> 01:40:28,793
Would you excuse me for one moment?

1458
01:40:51,476 --> 01:40:54,036
You have a lot of nerve busting in
on me like this.

1459
01:40:54,276 --> 01:40:56,471
I got plenty of nerve
to do anything I want to do.

1460
01:40:56,716 --> 01:40:58,946
- How far are you going to take this?
- I'm just starting.

1461
01:40:59,196 --> 01:41:00,595
Then I'm going to leave.

1462
01:41:00,836 --> 01:41:04,033
I don't intend on insulting these people
any more than I have to.

1463
01:41:07,596 --> 01:41:09,154
Behave yourself.

1464
01:41:20,516 --> 01:41:22,029
Come on. Let's go.

1465
01:41:29,076 --> 01:41:31,351
Stop pushing me. I'm going.

1466
01:41:37,596 --> 01:41:39,871
Bartender, could I please have
two apple schnapps?

1467
01:41:40,116 --> 01:41:41,947
I think you better make those doubles.

1468
01:41:43,556 --> 01:41:46,024
So, John, tell me,
you mad at me, honey?

1469
01:41:46,276 --> 01:41:47,550
Are you mad?

1470
01:41:47,916 --> 01:41:48,792
Are you?

1471
01:41:49,036 --> 01:41:51,550
- We're still friends.
- I hope so. I must tell you something.

1472
01:41:51,796 --> 01:41:54,310
You are so sexy when you're mad.

1473
01:41:54,556 --> 01:41:56,751
- Behave yourself.
- Stop telling me what to do.

1474
01:41:57,396 --> 01:41:59,352
I want to propose a toast.

1475
01:41:59,836 --> 01:42:01,906
From my top...

1476
01:42:02,156 --> 01:42:03,794
...to your bottom...

1477
01:42:04,036 --> 01:42:06,675
...from your bottom to my top...

1478
01:42:07,036 --> 01:42:09,709
...from my middle to your middle...

1479
01:42:10,556 --> 01:42:12,911
...be good, John,
I just might give you a little.

1480
01:42:13,156 --> 01:42:16,114
- Just behave yourself.
- Stop telling me what to do.

1481
01:42:16,356 --> 01:42:19,712
Besides,
your star witness is testifying.

1482
01:42:22,396 --> 01:42:23,306
Since when?

1483
01:42:23,556 --> 01:42:25,148
Since I thought about it.

1484
01:42:25,396 --> 01:42:28,115
And I realized how nice
you've been to me.

1485
01:42:28,356 --> 01:42:29,391
You know what?

1486
01:42:29,636 --> 01:42:31,911
You've treated me like a perfect lady.

1487
01:42:32,156 --> 01:42:34,716
You've even made me feel
so very special.

1488
01:42:34,996 --> 01:42:38,033
You know,
people can be so mean sometimes.

1489
01:42:38,276 --> 01:42:39,789
But not you.

1490
01:42:40,996 --> 01:42:42,714
I want to ask you something.

1491
01:42:43,316 --> 01:42:45,432
John, do you think I'm beautiful?

1492
01:42:47,996 --> 01:42:50,191
Yes, I think you're very pretty.

1493
01:42:50,836 --> 01:42:53,270
Pretty? I'm just not your type?

1494
01:42:54,716 --> 01:42:56,388
Are you testifying for me?

1495
01:42:56,636 --> 01:42:59,514
Of course I am. You think I give a shit
about Miss Jim Williams?

1496
01:42:59,756 --> 01:43:02,475
I don't even know that bitch.
Never even met her.

1497
01:43:02,716 --> 01:43:03,831
Listen...

1498
01:43:04,076 --> 01:43:08,433
...on cross-examination they'll be
pretty rough on you and your background.

1499
01:43:08,676 --> 01:43:13,227
I have nothing to hide and I'm
not ashamed of anything I've ever done.

1500
01:43:13,476 --> 01:43:17,833
You should know that you taking the
stand is a blanket indictment of Hanson.

1501
01:43:18,076 --> 01:43:20,192
Let me get this right, now.

1502
01:43:20,436 --> 01:43:24,668
You're saying because Billy hung out
with drag queens, he deserved to die?

1503
01:43:24,916 --> 01:43:26,872
- It's fucked up, but, yeah.
- That's fucked up.

1504
01:43:28,996 --> 01:43:30,907
Maybe you shouldn't testify.

1505
01:43:31,956 --> 01:43:34,629
John, how sweet. You really care.

1506
01:43:35,476 --> 01:43:38,195
Good. Because, guess what?
I'm testifying.

1507
01:43:38,436 --> 01:43:39,949
I am testifying.

1508
01:43:40,196 --> 01:43:43,154
You see, those folks think
they're using the Doll...

1509
01:43:43,396 --> 01:43:45,307
...but the Doll's using them right back.

1510
01:43:45,556 --> 01:43:50,266
I'm going to use that courtroom
as my coming-out party.

1511
01:43:50,516 --> 01:43:51,949
You see, you know who I am.

1512
01:43:52,196 --> 01:43:54,426
I'm the Lady Chablis.

1513
01:43:54,676 --> 01:43:55,995
Hear me roar.

1514
01:43:56,236 --> 01:43:57,146
Look out!

1515
01:43:58,756 --> 01:44:01,031
Besides,
I've already bought a new ensemble.

1516
01:44:01,276 --> 01:44:03,710
- Really? Is it nice?
- You'll see, hon.

1517
01:44:04,196 --> 01:44:05,470
Listen to me.

1518
01:44:05,796 --> 01:44:07,388
We must get out of here.

1519
01:44:07,636 --> 01:44:10,594
It's rude of you to bust in on me.
I'd never do that to you.

1520
01:44:10,916 --> 01:44:13,111
LaVella's mother
is about to have a seizure.

1521
01:44:13,356 --> 01:44:16,075
Somebody put a spoon in her mouth, then,
because I'm not leaving.

1522
01:44:16,316 --> 01:44:17,465
You're leaving now.

1523
01:44:17,716 --> 01:44:19,388
- I am not.
- I'll buy you a drink.

1524
01:44:19,636 --> 01:44:20,785
- Buy me a drink.
- Outside of here.

1525
01:44:21,036 --> 01:44:22,708
- Buy me a diamond.
- I'll buy you a diamond.

1526
01:44:22,956 --> 01:44:24,867
- Give me some.
- I'm not giving you shit.

1527
01:44:25,116 --> 01:44:26,629
Oh, come on!

1528
01:44:26,876 --> 01:44:28,309
You know I'm straight.

1529
01:44:28,556 --> 01:44:29,625
So am I.

1530
01:44:29,876 --> 01:44:31,867
Straight to my house. Let's go.

1531
01:44:38,196 --> 01:44:39,311
Raise your right hand.

1532
01:44:39,556 --> 01:44:43,947
Do you swear the evidence you're about
to give is the truth, so help you God?

1533
01:44:44,196 --> 01:44:45,072
I do.

1534
01:44:47,196 --> 01:44:48,754
Now, Miss De Veau...

1535
01:44:49,276 --> 01:44:52,905
...I'll ask you a question and
I want you to answer to the jury...

1536
01:44:53,156 --> 01:44:56,228
...so that they can understand.

1537
01:44:57,956 --> 01:45:00,868
Yes, and what is that?
You'd like me to explain my "T"?

1538
01:45:01,436 --> 01:45:03,154
Your "T"?

1539
01:45:05,116 --> 01:45:06,435
My "T."

1540
01:45:06,676 --> 01:45:08,507
Yeah, explain your "T"...

1541
01:45:08,756 --> 01:45:12,795
...in as plain a language
as you possibly can for our friends.

1542
01:45:13,036 --> 01:45:16,153
I will try my best to explain
to you jurors.

1543
01:45:16,396 --> 01:45:19,513
I could throw words and labels
at all of you...

1544
01:45:19,756 --> 01:45:21,428
...but you seem like nice people.

1545
01:45:21,956 --> 01:45:24,186
So I'm going to be open and honest.

1546
01:45:25,476 --> 01:45:28,274
I have a man's toolbox...

1547
01:45:29,036 --> 01:45:31,152
...but everything else about me
is pure lady.

1548
01:45:32,676 --> 01:45:34,155
I love to dress in women's clothes.

1549
01:45:35,116 --> 01:45:37,072
I love to go shopping.

1550
01:45:37,316 --> 01:45:39,227
I love to have my nails done...

1551
01:45:39,476 --> 01:45:41,910
...and I love men.

1552
01:45:45,236 --> 01:45:46,908
Any questions?

1553
01:45:49,316 --> 01:45:51,830
And, ma'am,
I hope you don't mind my saying...

1554
01:45:52,116 --> 01:45:55,108
...blue is definitely not your color.

1555
01:45:55,396 --> 01:45:57,148
Okay, gals, you're both pretty, now.

1556
01:45:57,796 --> 01:46:01,186
What I want to know
and want you to tell the jury is...

1557
01:46:01,436 --> 01:46:03,950
...how you and Billy Hanson first met.

1558
01:46:04,796 --> 01:46:07,947
Billy hit on me one night at the...
Strike that, Your Honor.

1559
01:46:08,476 --> 01:46:09,704
Billy and I clienteled.

1560
01:46:10,076 --> 01:46:11,065
"Clienteled."

1561
01:46:11,316 --> 01:46:13,113
Will you explain what that means?

1562
01:46:13,356 --> 01:46:17,872
We socialized together for a little
while, until he met my roommate Corinne.

1563
01:46:18,116 --> 01:46:20,346
Corinne.
Now, you telling me that...

1564
01:46:20,596 --> 01:46:24,111
...Corinne and Billy Hanson
were intimate?

1565
01:46:25,516 --> 01:46:27,586
Hot and intimate.

1566
01:46:29,876 --> 01:46:31,707
Will you tell the jury...

1567
01:46:32,156 --> 01:46:33,908
...did Billy Hanson use drugs?

1568
01:46:37,636 --> 01:46:41,345
Yes. Billy did pills, smoked pot...

1569
01:46:41,596 --> 01:46:42,870
...little coke.

1570
01:46:43,116 --> 01:46:45,346
He sold drugs.

1571
01:46:45,796 --> 01:46:50,312
He'd stay with us sometimes, so
sometimes we had stash around the house.

1572
01:46:52,596 --> 01:46:54,666
- Mrs. Chablis...
- Miss.

1573
01:46:55,076 --> 01:46:57,067
Course, Miss Chablis.

1574
01:46:58,316 --> 01:47:00,068
Do you yourself take drugs?

1575
01:47:01,876 --> 01:47:03,867
I smoke a little pot.

1576
01:47:04,116 --> 01:47:06,027
I'm a mellow kind of girl.

1577
01:47:06,796 --> 01:47:07,865
I understand.

1578
01:47:08,236 --> 01:47:12,229
Well, tell me
if you know what effect, if any...

1579
01:47:12,476 --> 01:47:14,865
...these drugs
had on the relationship...

1580
01:47:15,116 --> 01:47:17,471
...between your friend Corinne
and Billy.

1581
01:47:17,716 --> 01:47:21,948
Well, now, when Billy got high,
he could be very, very hostile.

1582
01:47:22,676 --> 01:47:24,075
Hostile, when he was high.

1583
01:47:24,316 --> 01:47:27,114
Would you explain to the jury
what you mean by hostile?

1584
01:47:27,356 --> 01:47:30,587
I can do more than that, hon.
Let me show you something.

1585
01:47:30,836 --> 01:47:32,872
Look at my driver's license.

1586
01:47:33,116 --> 01:47:35,391
- Just a minute.
- Objection.

1587
01:47:35,716 --> 01:47:36,671
This isn't proper.

1588
01:47:36,916 --> 01:47:37,985
Be quiet.

1589
01:47:38,236 --> 01:47:39,271
I'll handle this.

1590
01:47:39,516 --> 01:47:40,392
Just a minute.

1591
01:47:40,636 --> 01:47:42,308
That's not proper procedure.

1592
01:47:44,156 --> 01:47:45,714
Pick up this item, please.

1593
01:47:46,676 --> 01:47:50,635
My eye. He hit me. I looked like
that dog from <i>The Little Rascals.</i>

1594
01:47:50,876 --> 01:47:54,551
Members of the jury, I'm instructing you
to disregard this outburst.

1595
01:47:54,796 --> 01:47:56,866
Pay no attention to that picture.

1596
01:47:58,156 --> 01:48:00,431
Your Honor? It's the truth.
I'm not lying.

1597
01:48:00,676 --> 01:48:02,587
Your Honor, the people...

1598
01:48:02,916 --> 01:48:03,951
Be quiet.

1599
01:48:04,196 --> 01:48:06,949
Now we got to get this thing
under control.

1600
01:48:07,196 --> 01:48:08,754
You sit down, Mr. De Veau.

1601
01:48:08,996 --> 01:48:11,146
Miss De Veau. I'm a single girl.

1602
01:48:11,516 --> 01:48:13,188
Miss De Veau, whatever.

1603
01:48:13,436 --> 01:48:14,391
Have a seat.

1604
01:48:15,156 --> 01:48:17,750
Okay, but please don't get too huffy.

1605
01:48:18,156 --> 01:48:19,748
You listen to me.

1606
01:48:20,956 --> 01:48:23,390
I'm in charge of this courtroom,
not you.

1607
01:48:23,636 --> 01:48:24,955
Here's the way it works:

1608
01:48:25,196 --> 01:48:28,074
These lawyers
are going to ask you questions...

1609
01:48:28,316 --> 01:48:29,715
...and you answer them.

1610
01:48:30,156 --> 01:48:32,067
If I tell you to stop, you stop.

1611
01:48:32,996 --> 01:48:34,987
If I tell you to sit, you sit.

1612
01:48:35,236 --> 01:48:38,592
And I don't want you to communicate
directly with that jury.

1613
01:48:38,836 --> 01:48:40,235
Don't produce any more items.

1614
01:48:40,756 --> 01:48:43,873
Don't show any photographs.
Do you understand that?

1615
01:48:45,436 --> 01:48:47,631
Yes, Your Honor.
I understand.

1616
01:48:52,156 --> 01:48:54,590
Mrs. Wright threw in some gumbo.

1617
01:48:55,716 --> 01:48:57,035
I got you cigarettes.

1618
01:48:58,396 --> 01:49:02,514
Thank you. How are we coming
with our character witnesses?

1619
01:49:02,756 --> 01:49:07,432
I thought we would limit it to 3 because
we don't need too much fawning and...

1620
01:49:08,076 --> 01:49:09,270
Why not?

1621
01:49:09,516 --> 01:49:11,950
Tell him how many friends
are lining up to defend me.

1622
01:49:12,196 --> 01:49:15,268
I suggest Wanda Javitz.
She has a commanding vocal presence.

1623
01:49:15,516 --> 01:49:17,666
She declined, Jim...

1624
01:49:17,916 --> 01:49:19,190
...along with some others.

1625
01:49:20,556 --> 01:49:21,705
Declined?

1626
01:49:26,996 --> 01:49:28,907
They clamored for my friendship.

1627
01:49:29,156 --> 01:49:32,353
Hoping and praying
for invitations to my parties.

1628
01:49:33,316 --> 01:49:35,227
Where were their judgments then?

1629
01:49:36,876 --> 01:49:40,471
I hope Wanda knows this puts her
in the out box for my Christmas party.

1630
01:49:41,796 --> 01:49:44,868
I don't think we have to worry
about character witnesses.

1631
01:49:45,116 --> 01:49:46,390
They got theirs, we got ours.

1632
01:49:47,356 --> 01:49:48,789
When do I take the stand?

1633
01:49:49,476 --> 01:49:50,431
Last.

1634
01:49:50,836 --> 01:49:51,825
Good.

1635
01:49:52,076 --> 01:49:55,466
They'll have heard all the theories.
We'll finish with the truth.

1636
01:49:55,716 --> 01:49:56,865
I look forward to this.

1637
01:49:57,116 --> 01:50:01,553
It's important, not that I'm acquitted,
but that everyone knows I'm innocent.

1638
01:50:03,276 --> 01:50:05,949
I refuse to live in a world
where whispers become fact.

1639
01:50:06,196 --> 01:50:09,074
Guilty men murmur.
The innocent shout to the rafters.

1640
01:50:09,316 --> 01:50:10,590
Hear, hear.

1641
01:50:11,636 --> 01:50:16,107
We may need you to come clean
about the relationship with Billy.

1642
01:50:17,996 --> 01:50:19,429
Your sexuality, Jim.

1643
01:50:20,196 --> 01:50:23,506
Finley's taken this thing in a direction
we didn't count on.

1644
01:50:23,756 --> 01:50:25,951
His own private witch-hunt.

1645
01:50:27,956 --> 01:50:29,833
It's going to destroy Mother.

1646
01:50:31,636 --> 01:50:33,115
Jim, she was in court.

1647
01:50:33,356 --> 01:50:34,709
She heard George Tucker.

1648
01:50:35,196 --> 01:50:37,232
Face it, she already knows.

1649
01:50:38,076 --> 01:50:39,907
Not from me she doesn't.

1650
01:50:46,756 --> 01:50:48,667
What if she wasn't in court?

1651
01:50:59,356 --> 01:51:01,347
What's the matter?
Gunpowder?

1652
01:51:04,116 --> 01:51:06,152
Damn gunshot residue test.

1653
01:51:06,396 --> 01:51:09,786
Your expert witness covered it.
He said the tests are unreliable.

1654
01:51:10,036 --> 01:51:11,833
Jury thinks that's a cop-out.

1655
01:51:12,316 --> 01:51:14,591
Every one of them knows Doc Poe.

1656
01:51:15,516 --> 01:51:18,588
Why listen to some egghead
from up north? No offense.

1657
01:51:18,836 --> 01:51:19,951
No, none taken.

1658
01:51:20,796 --> 01:51:24,391
He said gunpowder wipes off.
Maybe when they handled the body...

1659
01:51:24,636 --> 01:51:26,592
Boone says he bagged them.

1660
01:51:27,356 --> 01:51:31,031
Doc Poe says they were bagged
when he performed the autopsy.

1661
01:51:31,676 --> 01:51:33,871
When are they going to get wiped off?

1662
01:51:35,276 --> 01:51:36,470
I don't know.

1663
01:51:40,476 --> 01:51:44,230
Do you remember when you told me
that dead men tell no tales?

1664
01:51:45,916 --> 01:51:47,031
See, I think...

1665
01:51:47,276 --> 01:51:51,030
...that may be true,
but it does not apply here.

1666
01:51:51,636 --> 01:51:53,274
I mean, look around.

1667
01:51:54,596 --> 01:51:57,793
Every picture on every wall in this town
is of someone who's gone.

1668
01:51:58,036 --> 01:52:01,187
Every story you hear begins
with someone who's dead.

1669
01:52:02,076 --> 01:52:06,388
The only living national treasure
you have is your own slavering mutt.

1670
01:52:07,116 --> 01:52:11,189
You writing your book?
What the hell are you talking about?

1671
01:52:11,436 --> 01:52:14,189
Billy Hanson may not be talking,
but his hands are.

1672
01:52:14,676 --> 01:52:16,553
Billy Hanson's hands?

1673
01:52:19,676 --> 01:52:20,950
I got to go.

1674
01:52:23,236 --> 01:52:24,510
Where you going?

1675
01:52:27,796 --> 01:52:29,627
"To understand the living...

1676
01:52:30,076 --> 01:52:32,510
...you got to commune with the dead.

1677
01:52:33,116 --> 01:52:34,390
I need Shango.

1678
01:52:37,116 --> 01:52:38,265
Now go.

1679
01:52:38,516 --> 01:52:40,666
And don't you dare look back."

1680
01:52:42,156 --> 01:52:45,034
I hope you can communicate
with someone.

1681
01:52:50,876 --> 01:52:52,867
Feel like going for a walk?

1682
01:52:54,676 --> 01:52:56,029
Where you headed?

1683
01:52:57,036 --> 01:53:00,267
I don't know, I was thinking about
maybe stopping by the morgue.

1684
01:53:01,076 --> 01:53:02,794
Are you a necrophiliac or something?

1685
01:53:03,036 --> 01:53:05,152
We agreed you wouldn't talk
about my ex-wife.

1686
01:53:05,436 --> 01:53:08,269
- How long you been at the bar?
- Long enough. It'll be fun.

1687
01:53:08,516 --> 01:53:09,915
Why do you want to go?

1688
01:53:10,156 --> 01:53:12,989
If I could answer that question,
I wouldn't have to go.

1689
01:53:13,236 --> 01:53:17,070
The morgue's closed, and by tomorrow
this won't seem like such a good idea.

1690
01:53:17,316 --> 01:53:22,026
Precisely. I'll break in if I have to.
I don't care. I'll pretend I'm dead.

1691
01:53:22,796 --> 01:53:25,310
- You sure you want to do this?
- I think so.

1692
01:53:26,236 --> 01:53:28,545
There is a back way...

1693
01:53:28,796 --> 01:53:31,515
...a hallway off the emergency room.
It's off-limits.

1694
01:53:31,756 --> 01:53:34,031
- How do you know that?
- I candy-striped one summer.

1695
01:53:34,276 --> 01:53:35,675
At the morgue?

1696
01:53:36,036 --> 01:53:38,231
- We'll create a distraction...
- We?

1697
01:53:38,476 --> 01:53:42,435
You create the distraction
and I'll just slip in and check it out.

1698
01:53:44,076 --> 01:53:45,748
No, you'll get lost.

1699
01:53:46,356 --> 01:53:48,916
All right, it's a 3-man job.
Where's Joe?

1700
01:53:49,156 --> 01:53:52,273
Perfect casting, but he's out of town
till tomorrow.

1701
01:53:53,916 --> 01:53:56,066
Who do we know
who can cause a commotion?

1702
01:54:03,676 --> 01:54:04,950
Hello! Nurse!

1703
01:54:09,036 --> 01:54:10,515
- What's wrong with her?
- Her stomach.

1704
01:54:10,756 --> 01:54:12,348
Appendicitis.
My water broke.

1705
01:54:12,596 --> 01:54:15,554
Get the doctor to exam 4.
Water broke? She's pregnant.

1706
01:54:15,796 --> 01:54:17,787
I don't know what's up. Just help.

1707
01:54:18,036 --> 01:54:20,152
- What's wrong?
- A stomach problem.

1708
01:54:20,396 --> 01:54:22,068
Let's get her up on the table.

1709
01:54:28,876 --> 01:54:30,150
Okay, here we are.

1710
01:54:30,396 --> 01:54:31,954
Commune away.

1711
01:54:32,196 --> 01:54:33,390
Is this where it hurts?

1712
01:54:33,636 --> 01:54:35,115
Just...
Oh, doctor, wait.

1713
01:54:35,916 --> 01:54:36,792
Here?

1714
01:54:37,036 --> 01:54:39,755
You know, I think you need to go
just a little bit lower.

1715
01:54:40,596 --> 01:54:41,665
Never been in a morgue.

1716
01:54:41,916 --> 01:54:43,349
What are we looking for?

1717
01:54:45,356 --> 01:54:48,712
I don't know. Something about
the bagging of the hands.

1718
01:54:49,196 --> 01:54:51,266
Oh, look. Teddy Lipscomb.

1719
01:54:52,076 --> 01:54:53,191
Excuse me?

1720
01:54:53,716 --> 01:54:56,833
- You know this guy?
- Yeah, he was my dad's dentist.

1721
01:54:57,556 --> 01:54:59,194
Oh, man!

1722
01:55:00,836 --> 01:55:01,712
Cardiac arrest.

1723
01:55:01,956 --> 01:55:06,347
Right. Medical term for dying in the
arms of a 25-year-old cocktail waitress.

1724
01:55:06,596 --> 01:55:07,346
Poor guy.

1725
01:55:09,436 --> 01:55:12,667
See, now, remind me
never to get sick in Savannah.

1726
01:55:12,916 --> 01:55:14,827
He's wearing a hospital I.D. Bracelet.

1727
01:55:15,076 --> 01:55:17,874
You're supposed to get well
in hospitals, but not in this city.

1728
01:55:18,196 --> 01:55:22,474
The morgue doesn't have its own ramp,
so all DOA's come through emergency.

1729
01:55:22,716 --> 01:55:24,946
Technically, they'd have to be admitted.

1730
01:55:27,556 --> 01:55:28,875
They're all wearing bracelets.

1731
01:55:29,116 --> 01:55:32,074
It's bureaucratic red tape.
I told you, I candy-striped.

1732
01:55:32,316 --> 01:55:34,227
You did.
That's like volunteer work?

1733
01:55:34,476 --> 01:55:36,751
Yeah, cute little striped outfit,
short skirt.

1734
01:55:36,996 --> 01:55:38,065
Girl Scouts.

1735
01:55:38,796 --> 01:55:40,468
- Is this where it hurts?
- Almost.

1736
01:55:40,716 --> 01:55:42,832
Just a tad bit...

1737
01:55:43,076 --> 01:55:45,636
That's the spot.
I love you.

1738
01:55:45,916 --> 01:55:49,113
I love you.
Oh, Dr. Feelgood, that's the spot.

1739
01:55:49,356 --> 01:55:50,550
You got it.

1740
01:55:55,876 --> 01:55:59,915
You wouldn't take a bag off
to put an I.D. Bracelet on, would you?

1741
01:56:00,756 --> 01:56:02,075
Yeah, probably.

1742
01:56:02,316 --> 01:56:03,271
Maybe.

1743
01:56:07,716 --> 01:56:10,469
Pleasure's been all mine, Doctor.

1744
01:56:10,956 --> 01:56:11,991
How you doing, Mom?

1745
01:56:12,236 --> 01:56:14,511
Nurse, I have a question for you.

1746
01:56:14,756 --> 01:56:17,509
Were you on duty the night
Billy Hanson's body came in?

1747
01:56:17,756 --> 01:56:19,428
I was.
How'd you get back there?

1748
01:56:19,676 --> 01:56:22,236
Back door.
I was here with the sick lady?

1749
01:56:22,476 --> 01:56:25,388
I have a question.
Hanson's hands were bagged.

1750
01:56:25,636 --> 01:56:27,274
Someone had to put the I.D. Bracelet on.

1751
01:56:27,516 --> 01:56:30,314
Would you take the bag off
to slide the bracelet on?

1752
01:56:30,556 --> 01:56:32,387
No, they snap on.

1753
01:56:33,356 --> 01:56:34,675
They snap on?

1754
01:56:36,476 --> 01:56:37,386
Thank you.

1755
01:56:37,636 --> 01:56:40,389
It was easier with him
because I bagged him after.

1756
01:56:43,436 --> 01:56:44,551
Excuse me?

1757
01:56:45,116 --> 01:56:49,587
Doc Poe called from the crime scene and
said to bag the hands when he came in.

1758
01:56:51,636 --> 01:56:52,989
You bagged the hands?

1759
01:56:53,436 --> 01:56:55,950
Yes, I wrote it up
on the admission sheet.

1760
01:56:56,196 --> 01:56:57,345
May I see that?

1761
01:57:00,156 --> 01:57:02,306
We'll let Sonny tell you.
He'll be here any minute.

1762
01:57:02,556 --> 01:57:06,071
Before Sonny gets here,
I'd like to run something by you.

1763
01:57:06,316 --> 01:57:08,466
- Fire away.
- About that night.

1764
01:57:15,956 --> 01:57:17,309
What do you got?

1765
01:57:19,076 --> 01:57:21,636
The evening started out
as I've always said.

1766
01:57:22,756 --> 01:57:23,825
<i>The argument...</i>

1767
01:57:24,236 --> 01:57:25,351
<i>... the shouting...</i>

1768
01:57:28,956 --> 01:57:30,947
You let me down, like everyone else.

1769
01:57:31,796 --> 01:57:35,391
My mama let me down. She hates me
because I look like my daddy.

1770
01:57:35,636 --> 01:57:38,070
- What are you yelling about?
- I'm yelling about you!

1771
01:57:38,316 --> 01:57:42,434
It's fine for you to talk to me
about living in this grandeur and all.

1772
01:57:42,676 --> 01:57:44,667
You could do it
if you took responsibility.

1773
01:57:44,916 --> 01:57:46,429
Bullshit, Jim!

1774
01:57:46,676 --> 01:57:49,713
If you don't like it,
why don't you just get the hell out?!

1775
01:57:49,996 --> 01:57:51,349
Get the hell out.

1776
01:57:51,596 --> 01:57:54,315
This candle is about ready
to go through that painting!

1777
01:57:54,556 --> 01:57:58,344
I'll stop paying the insurance
on your Camaro.

1778
01:57:58,596 --> 01:58:02,271
You want to leave,
you can do it tomorrow morning.

1779
01:58:05,116 --> 01:58:06,549
<i>The damaged clock...</i>

1780
01:58:17,596 --> 01:58:18,745
Goddamn it.

1781
01:58:18,996 --> 01:58:22,147
Walk into my house
and ruin my furniture. I've had it.

1782
01:58:22,396 --> 01:58:24,990
You're going to jail, young man.
That's it.

1783
01:58:26,396 --> 01:58:28,148
<i>Billy pointing the Luger...</i>

1784
01:58:28,396 --> 01:58:29,875
I may be leaving tomorrow...

1785
01:58:30,756 --> 01:58:31,871
...but goddamn it...

1786
01:58:32,236 --> 01:58:35,034
<i>But here's the difference:</i>
<i>When he pulled the trigger...</i>

1787
01:58:35,276 --> 01:58:36,152
...you're leaving tonight.

1788
01:58:37,116 --> 01:58:38,151
<i>... nothing happened.</i>

1789
01:58:38,396 --> 01:58:40,512
<i>The gun was on safety.</i>

1790
01:58:40,756 --> 01:58:43,907
<i>As he fumbled to take the safety off,</i>
<i>I grabbed my own gun...</i>

1791
01:58:49,716 --> 01:58:50,944
<i>... and I shot him.</i>

1792
01:59:06,876 --> 01:59:08,150
He fell dead.

1793
01:59:13,436 --> 01:59:15,267
He never fired?

1794
01:59:16,916 --> 01:59:17,871
No.

1795
01:59:19,036 --> 01:59:21,504
<i>I thought, "What have you done?!"</i>

1796
01:59:51,356 --> 01:59:52,994
It explains...

1797
01:59:53,236 --> 01:59:56,273
...why there's no powder
on Billy's hands.

1798
01:59:56,516 --> 01:59:59,952
When I sit on that stand
and I tell this to the jury...

1799
02:00:00,196 --> 02:00:01,675
...Largent's case...

1800
02:00:01,916 --> 02:00:03,634
...will crumble.

1801
02:00:10,756 --> 02:00:12,633
I don't see how you figure that.

1802
02:00:14,556 --> 02:00:16,308
If you tell that story...

1803
02:00:16,836 --> 02:00:18,155
...you're admitting...

1804
02:00:18,396 --> 02:00:19,624
...that you lied.

1805
02:00:21,956 --> 02:00:23,105
Lied to everyone.

1806
02:00:23,356 --> 02:00:24,675
The police...

1807
02:00:25,036 --> 02:00:26,389
...the press...

1808
02:00:28,076 --> 02:00:29,350
...everyone.

1809
02:00:32,316 --> 02:00:33,385
Yes.

1810
02:00:35,036 --> 02:00:36,389
Of course.

1811
02:00:38,556 --> 02:00:42,947
I'd rather be convicted of lying
than of murder.

1812
02:00:44,956 --> 02:00:45,911
So...

1813
02:00:46,916 --> 02:00:47,985
Hey, coach.

1814
02:00:48,236 --> 02:00:49,385
We got it.

1815
02:00:50,836 --> 02:00:51,825
Keep your seat.

1816
02:00:52,556 --> 02:00:54,547
Sonny, I need to tell you something.

1817
02:00:55,036 --> 02:00:58,312
Now, me first.
You know that gunshot residue test?

1818
02:00:58,556 --> 02:01:01,309
What I have to say has direct bearing
on the gunshot residue...

1819
02:01:01,556 --> 02:01:02,830
Can I get this out?

1820
02:01:06,476 --> 02:01:08,194
We got them by the gonads.

1821
02:01:08,436 --> 02:01:10,313
Detective Boone lied.

1822
02:01:11,356 --> 02:01:15,713
Doc Poe called the admitting nurse
and told her to bag the hands...

1823
02:01:15,956 --> 02:01:17,708
...if they were not already.

1824
02:01:17,956 --> 02:01:19,514
Which she did.

1825
02:01:19,796 --> 02:01:21,195
Right here in this document.

1826
02:01:26,876 --> 02:01:31,233
Many could have handled the body
between the crime scene and the hospital.

1827
02:01:31,956 --> 02:01:34,265
Which explains how the powder
got rubbed off.

1828
02:01:34,996 --> 02:01:36,145
There it is.

1829
02:01:37,036 --> 02:01:41,712
The death knell to Finley Largent's
precious gunshot residue test.

1830
02:01:45,196 --> 02:01:46,231
Your turn.

1831
02:01:47,116 --> 02:01:48,151
What was it?

1832
02:01:52,396 --> 02:01:53,988
Oh, it's not important.

1833
02:02:00,796 --> 02:02:02,070
Take a look here.

1834
02:02:03,116 --> 02:02:05,027
We got them, Jimbo.

1835
02:02:13,476 --> 02:02:15,068
Going somewhere, coach?

1836
02:02:23,396 --> 02:02:24,875
What's his story?

1837
02:02:45,156 --> 02:02:46,953
You're still under oath.

1838
02:02:47,676 --> 02:02:48,586
Frank...

1839
02:02:49,756 --> 02:02:52,031
...are you absolutely sure...

1840
02:02:52,276 --> 02:02:55,586
...that you bagged Billy Hanson's hands
at Mercer House?

1841
02:02:55,836 --> 02:02:56,951
Yes.

1842
02:03:00,516 --> 02:03:02,586
I have no further questions.

1843
02:03:03,156 --> 02:03:05,067
Redirect, Mr. Largent?

1844
02:03:09,396 --> 02:03:10,431
No, Your Honor.

1845
02:03:11,236 --> 02:03:15,787
Detective, you're excused. You're still
under subpoena. Thank you very much.

1846
02:03:16,276 --> 02:03:18,836
Defense calls Sara Warren...

1847
02:03:19,076 --> 02:03:20,191
...R.N.

1848
02:03:25,276 --> 02:03:27,028
You won't find her in your notes.

1849
02:03:27,276 --> 02:03:29,107
She's not on your list, Finley.

1850
02:03:29,356 --> 02:03:33,474
Sara Warren is a direct rebuttal
to the testimony of Detective Boone.

1851
02:03:34,396 --> 02:03:36,591
She is, in fact, an admitting nurse...

1852
02:03:36,836 --> 02:03:38,428
...at Chandler Emergency Room.

1853
02:03:58,996 --> 02:04:03,467
<i>Mr. Williams, will you describe</i>
<i>your relationship with the deceased?</i>

1854
02:04:05,716 --> 02:04:09,868
I met Billy Hanson when he came around
to the house wanting a job.

1855
02:04:10,796 --> 02:04:11,706
So...

1856
02:04:11,956 --> 02:04:14,424
...I hired him in the workshop
to refinish furniture.

1857
02:04:14,676 --> 02:04:17,190
He had some talent,
and I wanted to encourage him.

1858
02:04:17,716 --> 02:04:18,990
During this time...

1859
02:04:19,236 --> 02:04:23,024
...I developed hypoglycemia. I
blacked-out at times. I don't eat well.

1860
02:04:23,276 --> 02:04:24,948
The doctor told me...

1861
02:04:25,196 --> 02:04:28,586
...it was not good for me to be alone
when this condition occurs.

1862
02:04:28,836 --> 02:04:30,633
So Billy would stay over...

1863
02:04:30,876 --> 02:04:32,628
...and take care of me
when I wasn't well.

1864
02:04:32,876 --> 02:04:36,073
He did not live at Mercer House,
as has been stated.

1865
02:04:39,116 --> 02:04:43,906
Is that the full extent of your
relationship with Billy Hanson?

1866
02:04:45,876 --> 02:04:50,154
No. Over time, it evolved
into something less formal.

1867
02:04:51,076 --> 02:04:52,225
We became intimate.

1868
02:04:52,916 --> 02:04:54,747
Billy could be very charming.

1869
02:04:54,996 --> 02:04:57,351
He had his girlfriends and I had mine.

1870
02:04:57,836 --> 02:04:58,825
But to me...

1871
02:04:59,076 --> 02:05:01,431
...sex is a perfectly natural thing.

1872
02:05:01,756 --> 02:05:03,712
It didn't bother me.
It didn't bother him.

1873
02:05:04,276 --> 02:05:08,792
It was just an occasional natural
occurrence between consenting adults.

1874
02:05:14,476 --> 02:05:16,387
Would you describe to the jury...

1875
02:05:16,636 --> 02:05:19,389
...the events
that occurred in your house...

1876
02:05:19,636 --> 02:05:20,910
...after the party?

1877
02:05:23,116 --> 02:05:25,994
By the time Billy got back to the house
he was quite high...

1878
02:05:26,236 --> 02:05:29,069
...and we got into an argument
about a planned trip to London.

1879
02:05:29,476 --> 02:05:33,230
I was going to an auction, and Billy was
to accompany me because of my condition.

1880
02:05:34,716 --> 02:05:37,071
But he insisted on taking
marijuana cigarettes.

1881
02:05:37,316 --> 02:05:40,786
I do not approve of drugs
and I told him he could not go.

1882
02:05:41,036 --> 02:05:43,914
He became verbally abusive
and I ordered Billy out of the house.

1883
02:05:44,156 --> 02:05:45,509
He went into the hallway.

1884
02:05:45,756 --> 02:05:49,590
The argument continued there.
Then he knocked over a clock.

1885
02:05:50,756 --> 02:05:54,112
I went to call the police.
He followed me with a gun.

1886
02:05:54,356 --> 02:05:55,471
<i>He said...</i>

1887
02:05:56,996 --> 02:05:58,907
...and I'll never forget this:

1888
02:05:59,156 --> 02:06:00,555
<i>"I might leave tomorrow...</i>

1889
02:06:00,796 --> 02:06:03,264
...but goddamn it,
you're leaving tonight."

1890
02:06:05,716 --> 02:06:06,785
I saw that Luger...

1891
02:06:07,036 --> 02:06:07,832
<i>... and moved.</i>

1892
02:06:08,076 --> 02:06:10,192
I reached in a drawer
for my own weapon.

1893
02:06:10,436 --> 02:06:12,188
As I came up,
the first shot...

1894
02:06:12,756 --> 02:06:14,314
<i>... I felt breeze by my shoulder.</i>

1895
02:06:18,756 --> 02:06:19,745
And I fired.

1896
02:06:23,236 --> 02:06:24,749
I don't remember how many times.

1897
02:06:27,436 --> 02:06:28,915
<i>It was horrible.</i>

1898
02:06:53,516 --> 02:06:55,393
<i>We're all Savannahians.</i>

1899
02:06:55,636 --> 02:06:58,787
<i>Our paths cross from time to time.</i>

1900
02:06:59,276 --> 02:07:00,709
<i>We greet each other.</i>

1901
02:07:01,156 --> 02:07:03,226
<i>Smile here, nod there.</i>

1902
02:07:04,196 --> 02:07:06,152
<i>But even if we don 't know each other...</i>

1903
02:07:06,916 --> 02:07:08,668
<i>... we have one thing in common.</i>

1904
02:07:09,876 --> 02:07:12,709
<i>This beautiful place where we all live.</i>

1905
02:07:13,796 --> 02:07:15,468
<i>And as one Savannahian...</i>

1906
02:07:15,716 --> 02:07:16,865
<i>... to 12...</i>

1907
02:07:17,716 --> 02:07:21,152
<i>... I'd like to thank you</i>
<i>for your civic pride...</i>

1908
02:07:21,516 --> 02:07:22,949
<i>... for your diligence...</i>

1909
02:07:23,396 --> 02:07:25,193
<i>... and here in this courtroom...</i>

1910
02:07:25,676 --> 02:07:27,234
<i>... for your rapt attention.</i>

1911
02:07:27,476 --> 02:07:29,512
I've watched you taking notes.

1912
02:07:30,676 --> 02:07:33,634
The prosecution
started this whole thing...

1913
02:07:33,876 --> 02:07:36,344
...quoting someone
by the name of Hobbes.

1914
02:07:36,596 --> 02:07:38,029
I don't know who that is...

1915
02:07:39,276 --> 02:07:40,072
...but...

1916
02:07:40,356 --> 02:07:42,950
...I do know who Perry Mason is.

1917
02:07:43,636 --> 02:07:44,705
You watch <i>Perry Mason</i>?

1918
02:07:45,996 --> 02:07:46,985
I do.

1919
02:07:47,916 --> 02:07:49,269
And I got to thinking...

1920
02:07:49,516 --> 02:07:51,427
...if some TV writer...

1921
02:07:51,956 --> 02:07:53,947
...was to come to Perry Mason
and say...

1922
02:07:54,196 --> 02:07:58,030
..."Here you are, Mr. Raymond Burr,
here's a story like this."

1923
02:07:58,276 --> 02:07:59,948
You know what I think he'd say?

1924
02:08:00,196 --> 02:08:01,948
I think old Raymond would say...

1925
02:08:02,116 --> 02:08:04,584
"That's not a very good story.

1926
02:08:04,836 --> 02:08:07,350
I wouldn't have to be
a very good lawyer...

1927
02:08:07,596 --> 02:08:09,791
...to get that man off,
now would I?"

1928
02:08:10,636 --> 02:08:11,785
He'd be right!

1929
02:08:13,796 --> 02:08:14,785
Because...

1930
02:08:15,076 --> 02:08:18,910
...by all the evidence,
Jim Williams is an innocent man.

1931
02:08:20,676 --> 02:08:22,268
But I'm not Perry Mason.

1932
02:08:23,716 --> 02:08:25,672
I'm not some TV lawyer.

1933
02:08:26,876 --> 02:08:31,586
So I got to scratch and tear
at the prosecution's case...

1934
02:08:32,356 --> 02:08:35,189
...trying to whittle it down to nothing.

1935
02:08:35,836 --> 02:08:37,986
And darned if I don't think I have!

1936
02:08:39,836 --> 02:08:44,466
Because the fabrication
of the prosecution's case is in pieces.

1937
02:08:44,756 --> 02:08:47,429
When you consider
how Detective Boone...

1938
02:08:47,676 --> 02:08:51,908
...has consistently lied
about bagging the hands.

1939
02:08:55,476 --> 02:08:57,034
Does that surprise you...

1940
02:08:58,036 --> 02:08:59,788
...that a detective would lie?

1941
02:09:01,236 --> 02:09:02,874
Of course he will.

1942
02:09:03,476 --> 02:09:04,989
He's not a bad man.

1943
02:09:05,236 --> 02:09:07,511
But how else will he play the cards...

1944
02:09:07,796 --> 02:09:10,435
...that have been dealt to him
from a pack of lies?

1945
02:09:12,956 --> 02:09:14,230
If Jim Williams...

1946
02:09:14,916 --> 02:09:16,634
...is guilty of anything...

1947
02:09:17,676 --> 02:09:19,871
...he's guilty of bad association.

1948
02:09:21,276 --> 02:09:23,665
But that's not why he's on trial for.

1949
02:09:24,676 --> 02:09:26,348
If you don't like...

1950
02:09:26,596 --> 02:09:30,066
...or if you don't cotton
to his lifestyle...

1951
02:09:30,596 --> 02:09:32,188
...just think about this:

1952
02:09:32,796 --> 02:09:34,787
We deal with these people all the time.

1953
02:09:35,116 --> 02:09:36,151
Some good...

1954
02:09:36,396 --> 02:09:37,670
...some bad.

1955
02:09:39,196 --> 02:09:40,834
They're a part of our community.

1956
02:09:42,596 --> 02:09:44,712
You can't judge a man for that.

1957
02:09:45,636 --> 02:09:47,035
This is God's world.

1958
02:09:47,996 --> 02:09:49,907
Let God be the judge of that.

1959
02:09:51,556 --> 02:09:53,035
And let you good folks...

1960
02:09:54,076 --> 02:09:55,668
...be the judge of this.

1961
02:09:58,276 --> 02:09:59,550
Come on, now.

1962
02:10:02,636 --> 02:10:04,354
You let this man go home.

1963
02:10:08,556 --> 02:10:09,784
He's had enough.

1964
02:10:16,316 --> 02:10:17,431
Thank you.

1965
02:10:54,156 --> 02:10:57,466
Mr. Foreman,
has the jury reached a verdict?

1966
02:10:58,236 --> 02:10:59,749
Yes, we have, Your Honor.

1967
02:11:00,476 --> 02:11:01,704
Is it unanimous?

1968
02:11:02,796 --> 02:11:03,865
Yes!

1969
02:11:08,276 --> 02:11:09,914
Hand it to the sheriff, please.

1970
02:11:22,556 --> 02:11:24,035
Pick that up.

1971
02:11:28,356 --> 02:11:29,709
Hand it to me.

1972
02:11:37,916 --> 02:11:39,474
Give it back to him.

1973
02:11:50,396 --> 02:11:52,956
Defendant and attorneys,
rise, please.

1974
02:11:56,396 --> 02:11:57,988
Publish the verdict.

1975
02:12:00,476 --> 02:12:03,115
"We, the jury,
find the defendant...

1976
02:12:04,476 --> 02:12:05,511
...not guilty."

1977
02:12:14,676 --> 02:12:17,509
Members of the jury,
this concludes your work.

1978
02:12:17,756 --> 02:12:21,715
You've rendered great service
to Savannah and Chatham County.

1979
02:12:21,996 --> 02:12:24,829
I'm going to dismiss you now
with the thanks of the court.

1980
02:12:38,476 --> 02:12:39,704
Congratulations, Jim.

1981
02:12:39,956 --> 02:12:41,105
Thank you, John.

1982
02:13:12,116 --> 02:13:13,435
Hey, boy!

1983
02:13:18,396 --> 02:13:19,795
What do you got?

1984
02:13:20,756 --> 02:13:22,155
Come on down.

1985
02:13:23,196 --> 02:13:25,266
We gots to go visit the boy.

1986
02:13:28,716 --> 02:13:31,276
We got to make him
quit working James.

1987
02:13:31,996 --> 02:13:33,873
Trial's over, Minerva.

1988
02:13:34,556 --> 02:13:36,751
Billy can't do anything to James now.

1989
02:13:37,796 --> 02:13:39,388
Why I come to you?

1990
02:13:40,196 --> 02:13:41,754
Because you...

1991
02:13:41,996 --> 02:13:44,510
...out of everybody,
know it ain't over yet.

1992
02:13:46,156 --> 02:13:51,184
I know, the boy know, and you know
justice ain't been done yet.

1993
02:13:57,236 --> 02:13:58,874
I'll come down for a minute.

1994
02:14:01,916 --> 02:14:03,429
I don't know about this.

1995
02:14:03,676 --> 02:14:06,509
That's exactly why you come this far.

1996
02:14:32,996 --> 02:14:35,829
Billy always loved Wild Turkey.

1997
02:14:36,676 --> 02:14:38,348
He ain't happy here.

1998
02:14:41,316 --> 02:14:43,147
Ain't what he thought it would be.

1999
02:14:45,836 --> 02:14:49,146
If you ain't in heaven yet, you want
to get there, don't you, boy?

2000
02:14:51,836 --> 02:14:54,908
The only way you're going to get up...

2001
02:14:55,156 --> 02:14:57,624
...is if you quit playing with James.

2002
02:15:10,196 --> 02:15:12,630
I has influence with the dead.

2003
02:15:12,876 --> 02:15:14,707
They can lift you up.

2004
02:15:14,956 --> 02:15:18,073
Nobody else can do that for you.
Nobody!

2005
02:15:26,516 --> 02:15:28,268
Don't you laugh at me!

2006
02:15:28,956 --> 02:15:31,231
You think you had a harsh life?

2007
02:15:31,476 --> 02:15:33,546
You got no idea.

2008
02:15:37,556 --> 02:15:40,116
Never had no bills to pay...

2009
02:15:40,436 --> 02:15:43,473
...no children to feed,
no house to clean.

2010
02:15:44,876 --> 02:15:46,867
You had it easy.

2011
02:15:49,196 --> 02:15:51,551
You can just lay there.

2012
02:16:24,036 --> 02:16:25,185
Where's Jim?

2013
02:16:41,956 --> 02:16:43,708
Thanks for dropping by.

2014
02:16:47,076 --> 02:16:50,751
I've finished my Christmas party list...

2015
02:16:53,116 --> 02:16:54,026
...and you made the cut.

2016
02:16:54,276 --> 02:16:56,665
I'm honored,
but I won't be here.

2017
02:16:57,116 --> 02:16:59,186
Many will be disappointed.

2018
02:17:00,316 --> 02:17:02,750
So, obviously,
you've decided to stay in town.

2019
02:17:04,476 --> 02:17:07,354
Living here pisses off
all the right people.

2020
02:17:09,116 --> 02:17:12,233
- What can I do for you?
- I have something for you.

2021
02:17:12,476 --> 02:17:15,309
Yussopov's dagger may have seemed...

2022
02:17:15,556 --> 02:17:17,706
...more useful,
given your profession...

2023
02:17:17,956 --> 02:17:20,516
...but the painting
somehow seemed appropriate.

2024
02:17:20,756 --> 02:17:22,792
I hope you will accept it...

2025
02:17:23,036 --> 02:17:24,947
...as an expression of my gratitude.

2026
02:17:25,196 --> 02:17:26,834
<i>Newmarket Heath,</i> the overpaint.

2027
02:17:28,076 --> 02:17:28,952
Thank you.

2028
02:17:29,196 --> 02:17:31,551
I'll have it sent along.

2029
02:17:33,036 --> 02:17:35,345
I don't want to keep you
from your party.

2030
02:17:38,956 --> 02:17:41,789
But one more question, for the book.

2031
02:17:44,476 --> 02:17:46,387
Do you want to tell me
what really happened?

2032
02:17:52,836 --> 02:17:53,905
Sport...

2033
02:17:55,436 --> 02:17:57,711
...truth, like art...

2034
02:17:57,956 --> 02:17:59,867
...is in the eye of the beholder.

2035
02:18:02,956 --> 02:18:04,708
You believe what you choose...

2036
02:18:05,796 --> 02:18:07,707
...and I'll believe what I know.

2037
02:18:09,116 --> 02:18:10,390
Good luck, Jim.

2038
02:20:38,916 --> 02:20:40,269
Why didn't you come in?

2039
02:20:41,556 --> 02:20:44,070
I never enter the office on Sunday.

2040
02:20:44,316 --> 02:20:45,385
Bad juju.

2041
02:20:47,076 --> 02:20:48,794
I still got a lot of questions.

2042
02:20:50,756 --> 02:20:52,474
You know all you need to know.

2043
02:20:53,236 --> 02:20:54,510
One thing...

2044
02:20:54,916 --> 02:20:57,749
...don't commune so long with the dead
you forget the living.

2045
02:21:02,396 --> 02:21:03,670
What's this?

2046
02:21:14,716 --> 02:21:16,149
I love you, boy.

2047
02:21:16,916 --> 02:21:20,113
But I ain't the only one.
You know that, don't you?

2048
02:21:39,356 --> 02:21:41,074
How long's your lease?

2049
02:21:43,196 --> 02:21:44,595
Six months.

2050
02:21:46,996 --> 02:21:48,668
Welcome to Savannah.

2051
02:21:49,396 --> 02:21:50,272
You hungry?

2052
02:21:50,516 --> 02:21:52,427
- Come on.
- Let's go, girl.

2053
02:22:01,116 --> 02:22:04,426
You two know you're not going anywhere
without a chaperone.

2054
02:22:04,676 --> 02:22:08,954
I cooked my Chablis' famous chicken.
Let's go have a picnic.

2055
02:22:10,036 --> 02:22:11,264
And guess what?

2056
02:22:11,516 --> 02:22:14,269
You get your choice of breast or thigh.

2057
02:22:14,876 --> 02:22:16,673
What's it called, the chicken?

2058
02:22:17,076 --> 02:22:19,192
Chablis' Kicking Chicken.

2059
02:22:25,436 --> 02:22:26,994
Still walking the dog, Mr. Glover?

2060
02:22:27,236 --> 02:22:29,796
Yes, sir.
Patrick do like his morning walk.

2061
02:22:31,476 --> 02:22:34,707
Patrick is walking kind of fancy
this morning, isn't he?
