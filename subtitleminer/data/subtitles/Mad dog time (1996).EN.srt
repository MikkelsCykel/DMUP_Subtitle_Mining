But Vic is sick, Mick.

127
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:02,666
Vic is a sick prick, Mick.

128
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:07,370
Vic is a paranoid scIhizopIhrenic.

129
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:12,280
W Iho wouId Ihave tIhougIht it?
<i>O</i>ur. Vic, a paranoid scIhizopIhrenic.

And I tIhougIht Ihe was just a putz.

131
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:17,388
Vic toId me,

132
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:21,755
tIhat God speaks to Ihim
aII day and aII nigIht.

133
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:27,560
He can ,t get a good nigIht,s sIeep
because God won ,t stop yakking.

134
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:31,500
And Ihere ,s tIhe bombsIheII, Mick.

135
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:35,972
Vic does not want you dead anymore .

136
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:39,840
But God does.
At Ieast, tIhat,s wIhat Vic cIaims.

137
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:43,608
So, you,re off tIhe Ihook witIh Vic.

138
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:46,309
But you,re in deep sIhit witIh God.

139
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:53,458
TIhere are Iong periods of time
wIhen Vic Ioses contact witIh reaIity.

140
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:58,861
TIhat means Ihe couId kiII you

00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:05,394
I tIhink you sIhouId teII Ihim

143
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:11,206
Hey, Ben . Do you want a drink?

144
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:17,647
TIhe onIy otIher. tIhing is
Ihis personaIity. No Ionger. integrated.

145
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:23,654
In fact, Ihis personaIity Ihas spIit

Geez, wIhat,s tIhat second part

313
00:38:30,341 --> 00:38:36,007
witIh tIhis
sIhattering of tIhe sIhin sIhit?

314
00:38:37,181 --> 00:38:42,847
W ouIdn ,t it be better. to bury
a buncIh of buIIets in my beIIy,

315
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:48,857
skip tIhe second part of tIhe first part ,
go into tIhe first of tIhe second part ,

316
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:52,486

TIhe world is an ungracious pIace.

324
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:32,692
Y ou gotta Iook at it in a positive way.

It,s kinda Zen .

330

Zen by way of Ben . Ben Zen .

331
00:39:57,828 --> 00:40:00,922
I,m a practicing Ben BuddIhist.

332
00:40:01,031 --> 00:40:05,400
In certain circIes I,m known
as ,,Bubba,, Ben London .

333
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:14,940
Y ou,re not so Ihot

334
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:19,445
Is Ihe aIready dead?

335
00:41:00,224 --> 00:41:04,183

W Ihat do you figure is better.
over. tIhe Iong IhauI?

339
00:41:17,274 --> 00:41:20,141
Cunning or. baIIs?

340
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,472
A IheaItIhy mix.

341
00:41:24,582 --> 00:41:27,642
Jake was cunning,
but outfoxed IhimseIf.

342
00:41:27,785 --> 00:41:32,654
In my opinion ,
Ihe Ihad a reaIIy crappy Grand Design .

343
00:42:03,254 --> 00:42:07,520
Angina. TIhere ,s notIhing wrong

came out of tIhe woodwork .

348
00:42:43,594 --> 00:42:46,028
Let me fuck witIh tIhem for. a wIhiIe.

360
00:43:58,102 --> 00:44:01,230
Do you tIhink
Vic wants Grace dead, Mickey?

361
00:44:04,742 --> 00:44:08,109
TIhat,s a tougIh one to caII.

362
00:44:08,212 --> 00:44:13,309
But I gotta stick around to find out.

363
00:44:15,185 --> 00:44:16,812
I...

364
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:22,823
Y ou know, I went dead inside

So, I owe Iher

367
00:44:34,304 --> 00:44:38,968
Before Grace disappeared,
sIhe said sIhe was stiII nuts for. Vic.

368
00:44:39,076 --> 00:44:45,413
SIhe wants to get back togetIher. witIh Ihim
if everytIhing is rigIht witIh Ihis Ihead.

369
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:50,317

370
00:44:59,496 --> 00:45:02,590
Are you torcIhing for. Iher, Mickey?

371
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:06,127
No.

372
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:11,464
If you,re buIIsIhitting me

00:47:05,722 --> 00:47:08,714
I,m gonna go get you sometIhing to eat.

377
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:16,095
Don ,t dawdIe, Mickey.

378
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:32,982
Mickey.

379
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:35,746
Mickey.

380
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:41,915
I...

381
00:47:43,594 --> 00:47:46,427
I tIhougIht you sIhouId know:

382
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:50,933
SIeepy Joe got Ihis Ihead
fuII of IhoIes Iast nigIht.

383
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:55,164
He got Ihis brains bIown out.
In fact, Ihe,s dead.

384
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:10,249
Y ou don ,t know tIhe size
of someone,s brain ,

385
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:13,550
untiI you,ve swept it up
off tIhe carpet.

386
00:48:13,657 --> 00:48:19,653
Let me teII you,
SIeepy Joe Ihad quite a brain .

387
00:48:19,763 --> 00:48:24,894
Let,s face it, Mick.
Vic didn ,t beIieve you Iast nigIht.

388
00:48:26,169 --> 00:48:27,466
Tic Tac?

389
00:48:31,008 --> 00:48:33,340
TIhank you, Ben London .

390
00:48:37,014 --> 00:48:39,209
Rita, Ihow are you?

391
00:48:40,484 --> 00:48:45,114
Are you coming to Vic,s party?
It,s gonna be some wing-ding.

392
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:49,749
Be sure to bring Mick,s
dentaI cIharts for. identification .

393
00:48:49,893 --> 00:48:53,420
TonigIht we,II get to see
eacIh otIher' s cards.

394
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:56,624
And tIhe way I figure it is tIhis:

395
00:48:56,733 --> 00:49:01,670
Mick is bIuffing.
Vic isn ,t pIaying witIh a fuII deck.

396
00:49:01,805 --> 00:49:05,502
And I get to take Ihome
tIhe wIhoIe kitty, Rita.

397
00:49:08,812 --> 00:49:11,372
See you at Vic,s party tonigIht.

398
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:36,795
Rita.

399
00:49:37,908 --> 00:49:41,901
-GIad you made it. Y ou Iook beautifuI.
-TIhanks, Vic.

400
00:49:42,012 --> 00:49:46,915
Ladies and gentIemen . FoIks.

401
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:50,245
And Vic.

402
00:49:56,693 --> 00:50:00,686
I cooked up a IittIe sometIhing.

403
00:50:00,797 --> 00:50:04,927
It,s kind of my way of saying:

404
00:50:05,035 --> 00:50:07,629
,,W eIcome Ihome, Vic.,,

405
00:50:09,072 --> 00:50:14,066
Ladies and gentIemen ,
Mr. Danny Marks!

406
00:50:24,388 --> 00:50:26,856
Take it away.

407
00:50:26,957 --> 00:50:28,982
Vic, tIhis is for. you.

408
00:50:31,128 --> 00:50:36,191
And now, tIhe end is near.

409
00:50:36,299 --> 00:50:42,067
And so I face tIhe finaI curtain

410
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:46,001
My friends

411
00:50:46,109 --> 00:50:49,135
I,II say it cIear.

412
00:50:49,246 --> 00:50:52,215
I,II state my case

413
00:50:52,315 --> 00:50:55,216
<i>O</i>f wIhicIh I,m certain

414
00:50:55,352 --> 00:51:01,120
He Iived a Iife tIhat,s fuII

415
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:04,853
He traveIed eacIh

416
00:51:04,961 --> 00:51:08,590
And every IhigIhway

417
00:51:08,698 --> 00:51:13,226
But more , mucIh more tIhan tIhis

418
00:51:13,336 --> 00:51:15,736
Vic did it Vic,s way

419
00:51:17,941 --> 00:51:21,707
He did it Ihis way

420
00:51:21,812 --> 00:51:25,043
Regrets, Ihe Ihad a few

421
00:51:25,148 --> 00:51:29,778
-Introducing Grace to Mickey. K idding.
-But tIhen again

422
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:33,185
Too few to mention

423
00:51:34,224 --> 00:51:38,285
He did wIhat Ihe Ihad to do

424
00:51:39,396 --> 00:51:41,762
And Ihe saw it tIhrougIh

425
00:51:43,667 --> 00:51:44,759
W itIhout exemption

426
00:51:44,868 --> 00:51:48,998
-Y ou,re a paranoid scIhizopIhrenic, Vic.
-He pIanned

427
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:52,598
EacIh cIhartered course

428
00:51:52,709 --> 00:51:58,306
EacIh carefuI step aIong tIhe byway

429
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:03,852
But more , mucIh more tIhan tIhis

430
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:07,856
Vic,s gonna do it Ben ,s way

431
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:11,189
He did it Ihis way

432
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:14,729
-He Ioved
-Not IateIy.

433
00:52:14,831 --> 00:52:17,766
He IaugIhed, Ihe cried

434
00:52:17,868 --> 00:52:23,807
He,s Ihad Ihis fiII, Ihis sIhare of Iosing

435
00:52:23,907 --> 00:52:25,340
A Iot of tIhat IateIy.

436
00:52:25,442 --> 00:52:30,812
But now, as tears subside

01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:23,310
A sIhort pIhiIosopIhy
isn ,t necessariIy tIhe best.

574
01:06:23,412 --> 01:06:27,678
Sometimes it pays
to sIhop around for. one.

575
01:06:27,783 --> 01:06:31,446
I tIhink tIhey Iocked

577
01:06:35,858 --> 01:06:41,797

to searcIh for. IhimseIf.

578
01:06:45,434 --> 01:06:47,026

W Ihat do you tIhink of tIhe new gent?

580

Vic ain ,t interested.
He doesn ,t want to Iive anymore .

693
01:20:20,015 --> 01:20:24,179
It was triggered
by a goddamn profound ennui.

694
01:20:25,754 --> 01:20:28,052
Not tIhat again .

TIhat Vic is not
going to tIhrow it aII away.

703
01:21:02,624 --> 01:21:05,559
Grace triggered Ihappiness in Ihim once.

704
01:21:05,660 --> 01:21:10,256
I,m betting Ihe,s coming back
