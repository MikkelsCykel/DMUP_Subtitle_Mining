1
00:00:48,178 --> 00:00:49,805
She likes you.

2
00:00:51,974 --> 00:00:52,933
You see, Melanie...

3
00:00:53,225 --> 00:00:55,686
she's every bit as pretty.

4
00:01:06,154 --> 00:01:08,115
You've been very nice.

5
00:01:08,699 --> 00:01:10,951
Now you can have what you want.

6
00:01:25,048 --> 00:01:26,175
Hey, you!

7
00:01:26,717 --> 00:01:28,010
Birdboy!

8
00:01:42,065 --> 00:01:45,527
Mrs. Angelucci said them feathers
can give you asthma.

9
00:02:01,877 --> 00:02:03,587
I've got a great idea.

10
00:02:04,588 --> 00:02:05,964
Let's enlist.

11
00:02:16,683 --> 00:02:18,060
Kids got to play, honey.

12
00:02:18,352 --> 00:02:20,312
Go tell that to your son.

13
00:02:30,864 --> 00:02:32,574
Birdy!

14
00:02:33,575 --> 00:02:35,118
Are you all right?

15
00:02:58,475 --> 00:02:59,685
Switch shifts on Th8ursday?

16
00:03:03,313 --> 00:03:05,315
How come they didn't
change the bandages?

17
00:03:05,607 --> 00:03:07,985
No, ma'am.
He's 8unavailable right now.

18
00:03:08,277 --> 00:03:10,070
Can I have him call you?

19
00:03:19,246 --> 00:03:20,539
That's Doctor Moore.

20
00:03:59,369 --> 00:04:00,829
How long do I wear these things?

21
00:04:01,205 --> 00:04:04,458
We'll take them off when you
get back from seeing your friend.

22
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:07,628
Then I'll see if you got
everything back in the right place.

23
00:04:07,878 --> 00:04:11,048
Should be okay,
give or take an ear or two.

24
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,593
I think the graft is
going to be just fine, Al.

25
00:04:15,344 --> 00:04:19,014
After a while it'll start itching,
but you can't scratch it.

26
00:04:21,433 --> 00:04:22,976
This ought to hold you.

27
00:04:23,268 --> 00:04:24,478
How do you feel?

28
00:04:26,188 --> 00:04:28,065
Like the invisible Man.

29
00:04:28,482 --> 00:04:30,442
Come see me when you get back, okay?

30
00:04:30,692 --> 00:04:31,860
Sure thing.

31
00:04:32,152 --> 00:04:33,529
Don't worry.

32
00:05:44,558 --> 00:05:46,018
Don't stare, honey.
It's rude.

33
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:56,153
Shit, Birdy.

34
00:05:56,403 --> 00:05:58,280
The things you put me through.

35
00:05:59,114 --> 00:06:02,284
They always said you were weird.
Even my kid brother.

36
00:06:02,868 --> 00:06:04,953
Do you remember the time
with the knife?

37
00:06:33,941 --> 00:06:36,235
Jesus Christ!
These damn kids!

38
00:06:36,944 --> 00:06:40,405
Way to go! Now we'll never
get it back. The lady's a witch.

39
00:06:40,822 --> 00:06:41,865
Stay out of my yard!

40
00:06:42,157 --> 00:06:42,950
You hear?

41
00:06:43,242 --> 00:06:46,161
We don't have another ball.
How else we going to play?

42
00:06:46,453 --> 00:06:48,872
By not hitting it here.
Go somewhere else and play.

43
00:06:49,164 --> 00:06:52,167
This ain't no ballpark.
This is my yard.

44
00:06:54,044 --> 00:06:55,587
Why don't you do something about it?

45
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,339
Kids got to play, honey.

46
00:06:57,631 --> 00:06:59,508
You tell that to your own boy.

47
00:07:17,067 --> 00:07:18,443
I don't want to.

48
00:07:18,735 --> 00:07:20,279
Come on, why not?

49
00:07:20,863 --> 00:07:22,072
I just don't feel like it.

50
00:07:22,364 --> 00:07:24,241
Sure you feel like it.

51
00:07:28,787 --> 00:07:30,080
Well, if I let you...

52
00:07:30,372 --> 00:07:32,332
can I wear your letter jacket?

53
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:34,001
Yes.

54
00:07:34,376 --> 00:07:35,252
Hey, Al.

55
00:07:35,544 --> 00:07:36,670
- Al!
- What?

56
00:07:36,962 --> 00:07:38,839
He's down the street.
The weird kid.

57
00:07:39,131 --> 00:07:40,507
Later, Mario. Get lost.

58
00:07:40,757 --> 00:07:42,843
Come on, you promised.

59
00:07:57,316 --> 00:07:58,859
Hey, birdboy!

60
00:08:01,653 --> 00:08:02,738
What's your name?

61
00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:09,411
This is like talking to the air.

62
00:08:24,843 --> 00:08:27,763
Got a knife I can borrow, kid?
Got a splinter.

63
00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:36,522
This it, Mario?

64
00:08:36,855 --> 00:08:38,315
Yeah, that's my knife.

65
00:08:38,565 --> 00:08:40,526
You thief!
My brother says it's his.

66
00:08:41,151 --> 00:08:42,778
Back off!
Don't mess with me!

67
00:08:43,028 --> 00:08:44,571
Don't mess with my brother!

68
00:08:44,947 --> 00:08:46,406
He's a wrestling champion!

69
00:09:00,337 --> 00:09:03,090
Now you're in trouble!
This really better be your knife.

70
00:09:03,549 --> 00:09:05,342
It is.
Ziegenfuss stole it from me.

71
00:09:05,592 --> 00:09:07,386
I thought you said he stole it!

72
00:09:07,636 --> 00:09:09,096
No! I just said he had it.

73
00:09:10,264 --> 00:09:11,098
Jesus, Mario.

74
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:15,936
I bought it from Ziegenfuss.
But if he stole it, you can have it.

75
00:09:17,187 --> 00:09:18,063
Don't touch it.

76
00:09:18,605 --> 00:09:20,566
- It's mine.
- We'll get you another.

77
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:21,817
Here.

78
00:09:23,569 --> 00:09:24,611
Thanks.

79
00:09:27,573 --> 00:09:30,576
Where'd you learn all that stuff?
You wrestle or something?

80
00:09:30,826 --> 00:09:31,785
No.

81
00:09:32,494 --> 00:09:33,745
You should.

82
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:36,123
You like pigeons?

83
00:09:37,082 --> 00:09:38,250
What's to like?

84
00:09:38,542 --> 00:09:39,668
They fly.

85
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,044
They fly. So what?

86
00:09:42,462 --> 00:09:43,755
That's enough.

87
00:09:45,966 --> 00:09:47,843
Come on, Al. Are we going, or what?

88
00:09:49,761 --> 00:09:52,139
I'm training these
to be carrier pigeons.

89
00:09:53,015 --> 00:09:54,975
You mean with the notes,
like in a war?

90
00:09:57,853 --> 00:10:00,105
I got a class. I've got to go.

91
00:10:00,397 --> 00:10:01,356
So go.

92
00:10:01,648 --> 00:10:02,816
Up yours!

93
00:10:07,237 --> 00:10:08,405
Pretty ugly birds.

94
00:10:08,697 --> 00:10:12,492
You know, if he really can train
them to carry notes, I'd buy one.

95
00:10:12,784 --> 00:10:15,787
- You would?
- Sure. A lot of kids would.

96
00:10:20,709 --> 00:10:22,002
Wait a minute!

97
00:10:23,212 --> 00:10:25,589
How about if I help you catch some?

98
00:10:46,318 --> 00:10:48,028
It's funny how they do that.

99
00:10:48,445 --> 00:10:51,532
If it hadn't happened every
five minutes for the last 50 years....

100
00:10:51,823 --> 00:10:52,699
Dumb.

101
00:10:52,991 --> 00:10:54,451
They always come back
to the same place.

102
00:10:56,286 --> 00:10:57,287
See?

103
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:01,041
Same exact spot every time, and just
carry on with their business.

104
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:03,126
- Come on.
- Where you going?

105
00:11:03,377 --> 00:11:04,419
Higher.

106
00:11:04,711 --> 00:11:07,381
- We got to get up to talk to them.
- Are you kidding?

107
00:11:09,466 --> 00:11:11,343
Are we allowed up here?

108
00:11:11,844 --> 00:11:13,136
Looks awful high to me.

109
00:11:41,373 --> 00:11:42,416
Fuck you!

110
00:12:05,856 --> 00:12:06,773
It worked!

111
00:12:51,235 --> 00:12:52,861
Birdy, where are you?

112
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:59,034
Very funny.
Now where the fuck are you?

113
00:12:59,952 --> 00:13:02,704
Come the hell out.
I know you're in here, birdbrain.

114
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,002
What's that?

115
00:13:11,672 --> 00:13:13,549
A pigeon suit I'm making for you.

116
00:13:16,385 --> 00:13:18,428
This way, they'll think
you're one of them.

117
00:13:20,514 --> 00:13:22,683
I don't want them to think
I'm one of them.

118
00:13:23,684 --> 00:13:25,060
Come on, just try it.

119
00:13:28,605 --> 00:13:30,566
No way would I be caught dead in that.

120
00:13:41,285 --> 00:13:42,452
I feel ridiculous.

121
00:13:42,953 --> 00:13:44,163
You look terrific.

122
00:13:44,454 --> 00:13:45,247
Come on.

123
00:13:45,539 --> 00:13:46,832
It's over here.

124
00:14:02,431 --> 00:14:04,224
I want to go change.
I look stupid!

125
00:14:04,474 --> 00:14:06,185
Not to a bird, Al.

126
00:14:39,968 --> 00:14:41,595
That's some view.

127
00:14:42,012 --> 00:14:44,014
Can you see the Tower Theatre?

128
00:14:44,389 --> 00:14:46,725
That must be City Hall over there.

129
00:14:48,769 --> 00:14:50,229
Stars, Al.

130
00:14:50,521 --> 00:14:52,314
Look at the stars.

131
00:14:52,981 --> 00:14:54,525
What stars?

132
00:14:56,068 --> 00:14:58,195
We should come back
to just look at them.

133
00:15:00,489 --> 00:15:03,408
What are you doing?
For chrissakes, get down!

134
00:15:10,123 --> 00:15:11,834
Hold my legs, will you, Al?

135
00:15:15,504 --> 00:15:17,130
You'll like this one, Al.

136
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:19,883
She looks like your dad.

137
00:15:21,677 --> 00:15:23,387
I got to get a little lower.

138
00:15:23,637 --> 00:15:24,888
Let me down a bit more.

139
00:15:25,848 --> 00:15:27,391
Jesus, Birdy!

140
00:15:28,058 --> 00:15:29,184
Give me a bag.

141
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,608
Fuck!

142
00:15:42,739 --> 00:15:44,449
No! Birdy!

143
00:15:47,035 --> 00:15:48,245
Hold on, I'll get help.

144
00:15:49,371 --> 00:15:50,831
I can't hold on that long.

145
00:15:51,206 --> 00:15:52,833
What's so funny?

146
00:15:53,542 --> 00:15:54,459
You.

147
00:15:54,751 --> 00:15:55,627
You look so serious.

148
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:57,546
It is fucking serious!

149
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:00,757
Shit!

150
00:16:02,217 --> 00:16:04,219
Look, this isn't going to work.

151
00:16:05,053 --> 00:16:07,264
I'll try to make it to the sand pile.

152
00:16:07,556 --> 00:16:09,516
- What are you talking about?
- It's easy.

153
00:16:09,808 --> 00:16:10,684
You'll jump?

154
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:13,854
No, Al, I'm going to fly.

155
00:16:14,146 --> 00:16:15,022
Don't jump!

156
00:16:15,314 --> 00:16:16,440
Let go!

157
00:16:56,188 --> 00:16:57,981
Birdy, are you all right?

158
00:17:01,318 --> 00:17:03,570
Birdy, are you all right?

159
00:17:05,155 --> 00:17:06,198
I flew, Al.

160
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:07,616
Sure, you flew.

161
00:17:07,908 --> 00:17:09,284
It was beautiful.

162
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:13,330
It was like....

163
00:17:14,706 --> 00:17:16,416
You look awful pale, Birdy.

164
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:18,085
Should I go get somebody?

165
00:17:18,544 --> 00:17:20,796
You might have busted something inside.

166
00:17:21,213 --> 00:17:23,882
You'll break your crazy neck
one of these days.

167
00:17:30,013 --> 00:17:32,850
God, Birdy!
Don't do anything like that again.

168
00:17:47,656 --> 00:17:49,283
What do you think, sergeant?

169
00:17:50,617 --> 00:17:51,618
Sir?

170
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:53,120
Your friend.

171
00:17:53,412 --> 00:17:55,289
How does he look to you?

172
00:17:55,581 --> 00:17:58,667
It's hard to say.
I'm not sure I understand your question.

173
00:17:58,959 --> 00:18:00,335
It's a simple question.

174
00:18:00,586 --> 00:18:02,379
How does your friend look?

175
00:18:03,213 --> 00:18:04,923
Are you his doctor?

176
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:08,260
Why are you asking me?

177
00:18:08,844 --> 00:18:12,097
Obviously, because I want to hear
what you have to say.

178
00:18:14,349 --> 00:18:17,603
He doesn't look good.
Does he just sit there like that?

179
00:18:17,895 --> 00:18:19,438
For the most part.

180
00:18:20,189 --> 00:18:21,106
Was he wounded?

181
00:18:21,398 --> 00:18:23,025
Yes, but his wounds
were relatively minor.

182
00:18:23,317 --> 00:18:25,444
This is not a physiological condition.

183
00:18:25,736 --> 00:18:27,362
Then how'd he get like this?

184
00:18:27,613 --> 00:18:31,033
All we know is that he was
missing in action for a month.

185
00:18:31,325 --> 00:18:33,577
For a while, we didn't even
know who he was.

186
00:18:33,869 --> 00:18:35,120
Does he know who he is?

187
00:18:35,412 --> 00:18:36,622
I don't know.

188
00:18:36,914 --> 00:18:38,999
He hasn't talked since he was found.

189
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:42,085
So you really don't know anything.

190
00:18:42,377 --> 00:18:45,380
I think I know a few things, sergeant.

191
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:47,841
It was my idea to bring you here.

192
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,344
Why am I here?

193
00:18:50,594 --> 00:18:52,846
The patient's mother
thought you might be...

194
00:18:53,138 --> 00:18:55,015
well, of some help.

195
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:57,893
Frankly, I'm willing to try anything.

196
00:18:58,644 --> 00:19:00,812
- And I'm it?
- For now.

197
00:19:02,147 --> 00:19:04,107
When I found out about
your condition....

198
00:19:05,859 --> 00:19:08,612
It seems like it might be
an interesting therapy.

199
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,490
For him or for me?

200
00:19:11,782 --> 00:19:13,492
I hope for both of you.

201
00:19:13,784 --> 00:19:16,537
Come with me.
There's something I want you to see.

202
00:19:24,253 --> 00:19:25,963
No, tuna salad, not chicken salad.

203
00:19:26,255 --> 00:19:28,841
Lots of mayonnaise and none of those
little celery chunks.

204
00:19:29,132 --> 00:19:30,092
Two of them.

205
00:19:30,384 --> 00:19:31,552
Do you want anything?

206
00:19:32,678 --> 00:19:33,512
Coffee?

207
00:19:34,179 --> 00:19:36,265
Two coffees, cream and sugar.

208
00:19:38,308 --> 00:19:39,768
Okay, yeah, that's it.

209
00:19:45,107 --> 00:19:46,358
Strange, huh?

210
00:19:47,526 --> 00:19:50,612
Jumping and twisting,
like he was trying to escape.

211
00:19:50,904 --> 00:19:52,698
You sure can't blame him for that.

212
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:54,867
No one is, sergeant.

213
00:19:55,159 --> 00:19:57,286
He wouldn't like being cooped up here.

214
00:19:58,328 --> 00:20:02,875
What do you suppose impels him
into these strange positions?

215
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:04,418
Like what?

216
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:05,627
Like this...

217
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:07,713
cringing position.

218
00:20:08,755 --> 00:20:12,634
Was there any psychological trouble
before he was in the military?

219
00:20:13,177 --> 00:20:14,136
How close were you?

220
00:20:14,428 --> 00:20:17,181
We was real good buddies.
Pretty close.

221
00:20:17,431 --> 00:20:18,223
Very close?

222
00:20:18,724 --> 00:20:21,727
We weren't queer for one another
or anything like that.

223
00:20:21,977 --> 00:20:24,104
We were normal, crazy Philly kids.

224
00:20:24,396 --> 00:20:25,189
How crazy?

225
00:20:25,522 --> 00:20:27,065
You ever been to Philly, sir?

226
00:20:27,357 --> 00:20:29,902
You have to be pretty crazy
to live there.

227
00:20:33,113 --> 00:20:35,532
I don't understand yet
what's brought him to this.

228
00:20:36,867 --> 00:20:37,993
You got any ideas?

229
00:20:41,497 --> 00:20:42,706
He got drafted.

230
00:20:43,081 --> 00:20:45,125
All wars have
their casualties, sergeant...

231
00:20:45,417 --> 00:20:47,211
and the Army takes care
of their own.

232
00:20:47,628 --> 00:20:49,338
Certainly took care of me, doctor.

233
00:20:49,671 --> 00:20:50,506
Major, sergeant.

234
00:20:51,173 --> 00:20:52,466
Major, sir.

235
00:20:53,175 --> 00:20:55,928
I know that this is difficult
for you at this time.

236
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:59,473
And I know it's hard for you
to come here like this.

237
00:21:00,182 --> 00:21:01,350
How does your face feel?

238
00:21:02,518 --> 00:21:03,602
It's okay.

239
00:21:04,061 --> 00:21:05,020
No problems?

240
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,233
The bandages are a little hard
to get used to, sir.

241
00:21:09,483 --> 00:21:10,859
When the doctor...
The major...

242
00:21:11,109 --> 00:21:14,947
said one of the things they
had to do was give me a steel jaw...

243
00:21:15,239 --> 00:21:17,699
l thought, "Great!
A steel jaw!

244
00:21:17,991 --> 00:21:19,952
Maybe I'll be the next La Motta."

245
00:21:20,244 --> 00:21:22,913
Turns out, a punch could knock
the pins into my brain...

246
00:21:23,163 --> 00:21:24,957
so it's worse than a glass jaw.

247
00:21:25,249 --> 00:21:26,875
It's pretty funny, huh?

248
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:30,045
A lot of people wouldn't think so.
Aren't you concerned?

249
00:21:31,505 --> 00:21:33,382
Sure, kind of.

250
00:21:34,758 --> 00:21:36,802
You know what would be
a good idea, Alfonso?

251
00:21:37,344 --> 00:21:39,721
- Al.
- It might be helpful...

252
00:21:40,013 --> 00:21:42,057
if you visited your friend now.

253
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:45,769
It's important that
I make some progress soon.

254
00:21:47,104 --> 00:21:50,023
Ronsky? Send Renaldi in here.

255
00:21:51,233 --> 00:21:54,653
You'll like Renaldi, Alfonso.
He's Italian too.

256
00:21:57,698 --> 00:21:59,575
What's going on here?

257
00:21:59,867 --> 00:22:02,703
Occupational therapy.
Some genius at Boeing thought it up.

258
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:06,540
Who better to sort out
the nuts than nuts, right?

259
00:22:06,915 --> 00:22:09,251
- What do you do here?
- Pretty much everything.

260
00:22:09,543 --> 00:22:11,545
Mostly I help take care
of the patients.

261
00:22:11,837 --> 00:22:14,214
I take them for walks,
read them the funnies...

262
00:22:14,506 --> 00:22:16,633
blow their noses,
change the bedpans...

263
00:22:16,925 --> 00:22:19,344
wheel them into the TV room.
Stuff like that.

264
00:22:19,636 --> 00:22:22,222
How'd you get that shitty job?
They bust you?

265
00:22:22,514 --> 00:22:24,141
I'm a conscientious objector.

266
00:22:24,391 --> 00:22:25,767
You're kidding.

267
00:22:26,643 --> 00:22:28,520
An Italian conscientious objector?

268
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:30,063
That's right.

269
00:22:31,815 --> 00:22:33,859
Hi, Ned. Nice day.

270
00:22:34,651 --> 00:22:37,029
Ned's elevator doesn't go
up to the top floor.

271
00:22:37,321 --> 00:22:39,781
Combat stress. He's quiet today.

272
00:22:40,073 --> 00:22:42,826
Normally, he's throwing shit
against the walls.

273
00:22:43,994 --> 00:22:45,370
Here he is.

274
00:22:48,624 --> 00:22:51,001
I'll be back soon, and
I'll take you to your bunk.

275
00:22:51,293 --> 00:22:52,920
They have you in with me.

276
00:22:55,964 --> 00:22:57,257
Take it easy.

277
00:23:12,564 --> 00:23:13,732
Hey, Birdy.

278
00:23:16,485 --> 00:23:18,654
Is this for real, or what?

279
00:23:20,197 --> 00:23:23,992
If this is some act you cooked up to
get out of Nam, it worked.

280
00:23:24,284 --> 00:23:25,994
You can stop now.

281
00:23:37,339 --> 00:23:38,882
Come on, Birdy.

282
00:23:41,009 --> 00:23:42,970
It's me under all these bandages.

283
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:44,596
It's Al.

284
00:23:49,351 --> 00:23:52,187
Maybe I'll get into
something crazy myself.

285
00:23:53,063 --> 00:23:54,690
Can't you see it?

286
00:23:55,107 --> 00:23:59,319
" Neighborhood Boy Turned a Lunatic
by the Horrors of War."

287
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:02,489
All I'd have to do
for a pension is growl...

288
00:24:02,739 --> 00:24:05,325
or go beat somebody up
on Market Street.

289
00:24:07,411 --> 00:24:09,371
So much for that.

290
00:24:30,601 --> 00:24:33,145
God, this place gives me the creeps.

291
00:24:34,646 --> 00:24:37,107
It's awful quiet for a loony bin.

292
00:24:42,821 --> 00:24:45,324
You know, they keep saying
I'll be fine.

293
00:24:46,241 --> 00:24:48,035
I keep hearing them.

294
00:24:49,286 --> 00:24:52,372
"Quit worrying how you look,
Columbato."

295
00:24:56,543 --> 00:24:59,922
But I saw a guy at Dix
who they also said would be fine.

296
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:03,842
And he had a face like
a medium-rare cheeseburger.

297
00:25:15,646 --> 00:25:20,275
I'm scared I won't recognize
who I'm shaving in the morning.

298
00:25:24,696 --> 00:25:27,366
Jesus, Birdy, what happened to you?

299
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:33,372
That fat-gut shrink,
he wants me to jog up your brain...

300
00:25:33,664 --> 00:25:36,917
by getting you to remember
the things we did together.

301
00:25:37,209 --> 00:25:40,128
Did we jack one another off?
Stuff like that.

302
00:25:41,797 --> 00:25:43,674
I don't trust that guy.

303
00:25:43,966 --> 00:25:46,802
Everything's too interesting to him.

304
00:25:48,303 --> 00:25:50,681
So what do you want to talk about?

305
00:25:56,436 --> 00:25:59,523
Maybe we should talk about
one of the 85 million times...

306
00:25:59,815 --> 00:26:03,443
we tried to find where your mother
hid the goddamn baseballs.

307
00:26:09,783 --> 00:26:11,952
Okay, you don't like that one.

308
00:26:20,752 --> 00:26:24,214
Remember that statue of Billy Penn
on top of City Hall?

309
00:26:25,048 --> 00:26:28,135
How, from certain angles,
it looked like he had a hard-on?

310
00:26:28,385 --> 00:26:31,763
And how we used to stand there
with the pigeons?

311
00:26:32,055 --> 00:26:35,309
Every time some old lady would walk by,
we'd point at Billy Penn.

312
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:38,979
They'd look up, and they'd see
Billy with his dong sticking up.

313
00:26:44,776 --> 00:26:45,819
Shit!

314
00:26:46,111 --> 00:26:47,905
Do you need a hand?

315
00:26:48,614 --> 00:26:49,781
What are you doing here?

316
00:26:50,199 --> 00:26:52,075
I'm his friend.
The doctor brought me.

317
00:26:53,076 --> 00:26:54,119
Right!

318
00:26:56,288 --> 00:26:57,915
Now I remember.

319
00:27:00,167 --> 00:27:02,711
- What's your name?
- Columbato, Al.

320
00:27:03,629 --> 00:27:05,005
You know, I'm not in the Army.

321
00:27:05,255 --> 00:27:08,091
You can tell me your name
frontways if you want to.

322
00:27:09,343 --> 00:27:10,511
I'm Hannah.

323
00:27:11,136 --> 00:27:12,513
He eats that?

324
00:27:13,138 --> 00:27:16,767
Looks horrible, doesn't it?
It's all he'll let me feed him.

325
00:27:17,059 --> 00:27:18,685
You have to feed him?

326
00:27:19,478 --> 00:27:20,646
Can't he feed himself?

327
00:27:20,938 --> 00:27:22,481
I don't know.

328
00:27:22,731 --> 00:27:24,191
He doesn't.

329
00:27:25,067 --> 00:27:27,402
He won't let the orderlies feed him.

330
00:27:27,694 --> 00:27:29,154
For some reason, he lets me.

331
00:27:29,446 --> 00:27:31,782
Shit, maybe I'll stop talking.

332
00:27:33,116 --> 00:27:34,493
I like your friend.

333
00:27:35,035 --> 00:27:37,162
But I wish he wouldn't do this.

334
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:42,876
Listen, I'm going to go.

335
00:27:43,293 --> 00:27:44,837
You can stay if you want.

336
00:27:45,128 --> 00:27:47,714
That's all right.
I'll go bunk out for a while.

337
00:27:48,006 --> 00:27:50,217
Okay, hang on. I'll unlock you.

338
00:28:13,532 --> 00:28:15,993
Hi there.
Let me take a look at your back.

339
00:28:22,166 --> 00:28:23,959
Tell me where it hurts.

340
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:46,064
My buddy's broken his leg.

341
00:28:46,356 --> 00:28:47,983
Maybe his back.

342
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:51,820
I hope not his back,
because that can make you crazy.

343
00:28:53,071 --> 00:28:56,408
He's a little crazy.
He thinks he can fly.

344
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,660
He thinks he's a bird.

345
00:29:25,562 --> 00:29:28,899
It's all here, the whole thing,
how he fell off the gas tank.

346
00:29:29,775 --> 00:29:33,737
There's a picture showing where he
jumped and an "X" where he landed!

347
00:29:34,112 --> 00:29:37,908
I don't want to hear any more!
Not birds, not nothing!

348
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:39,827
You can start now...

349
00:29:40,077 --> 00:29:42,830
by cleaning the pigeon shit
off the front porch.

350
00:29:48,252 --> 00:29:50,712
Face it, we're out of
the pigeon business.

351
00:29:51,004 --> 00:29:54,007
- They ain't coming back.
- They'll come back, they were homed.

352
00:29:54,299 --> 00:29:58,095
What kind of home is it when
your witch of a mom chops it up...

353
00:29:58,387 --> 00:30:00,264
and chases the birds away?

354
00:30:00,514 --> 00:30:01,640
It's home to them.

355
00:30:01,932 --> 00:30:04,309
It's not the lumber and nails.
It's the place.

356
00:30:04,601 --> 00:30:06,562
I got to tell you something.

357
00:30:06,854 --> 00:30:09,106
But you have to promise
not to go ape-shit on me.

358
00:30:09,398 --> 00:30:10,190
What?

359
00:30:10,482 --> 00:30:11,733
Do you promise?

360
00:30:13,819 --> 00:30:15,988
You're right.
Those birds kept coming back.

361
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,699
Your mom puts down poison
and knocks off half of them.

362
00:30:18,991 --> 00:30:22,077
But those blue bars get smart
and still keep coming back.

363
00:30:22,369 --> 00:30:24,163
So she calls Mr. Solari.

364
00:30:24,454 --> 00:30:26,331
Mr. Solari, the poultry guy?

365
00:30:26,582 --> 00:30:27,666
Yeah, the butcher.

366
00:30:27,958 --> 00:30:30,294
That guy would dress his mother
as a chicken...

367
00:30:30,586 --> 00:30:32,296
if he got 69 cents a pound.

368
00:30:32,588 --> 00:30:35,257
He must've taken them.
They ain't been back since.

369
00:30:35,507 --> 00:30:37,134
No, you don't get it, Al.

370
00:30:37,384 --> 00:30:38,844
Those blue bars saw Solari.

371
00:30:39,136 --> 00:30:41,013
That's why they didn't come back.

372
00:30:41,305 --> 00:30:43,015
You're wrong!
Solari bagged them.

373
00:30:43,307 --> 00:30:46,059
They're dead!
Plucked and fucked!

374
00:30:46,643 --> 00:30:48,937
You don't understand birds, Al.

375
00:30:49,521 --> 00:30:52,441
I got an idea for something else
we can go partners on.

376
00:30:52,733 --> 00:30:54,943
You know that old Ford
at the junkyard?

377
00:30:55,235 --> 00:30:56,612
Yeah, okay.

378
00:30:57,863 --> 00:31:00,949
It's a good thing those blue bars
recognized Solari, huh?

379
00:31:01,492 --> 00:31:03,118
Pigeons ain't stupid, Al!

380
00:31:52,584 --> 00:31:55,838
Remember that statue
of Billy Penn on top of City Hall?

381
00:31:56,088 --> 00:31:59,633
How, from certain angles,
it looked like he had a hard-on?

382
00:32:16,441 --> 00:32:19,695
If I'm going to learn,
I'll have to watch them closer.

383
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:24,116
Be there when they fly.

384
00:32:26,535 --> 00:32:29,538
I want them to be
as free as possible.

385
00:32:30,497 --> 00:32:32,666
Nobody wants to be in a cage.

386
00:34:39,251 --> 00:34:41,253
How are you doing back there?

387
00:34:41,545 --> 00:34:44,006
- You okay?
- Yeah, just great.

388
00:35:17,915 --> 00:35:20,250
That is some piece of shit.

389
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:22,002
Does it go?

390
00:35:22,753 --> 00:35:24,213
Not yet.

391
00:35:24,505 --> 00:35:25,339
But it will.

392
00:35:26,715 --> 00:35:29,176
- How'd it get here?
- We pushed it.

393
00:35:29,468 --> 00:35:31,929
- It's a piece of shit.
- Thank you.

394
00:35:34,181 --> 00:35:35,807
Don't use any of my tools.

395
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,684
No, sir.

396
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:40,812
You'll have to register that
before you sell it.

397
00:35:41,396 --> 00:35:42,648
How, Mr. Columbato?

398
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:45,692
You wait till you're old enough.

399
00:35:45,984 --> 00:35:49,071
- Maybe I'll do it for you.
- That'd be great, Dad.

400
00:35:51,323 --> 00:35:52,950
Fucking garbageman!

401
00:36:08,966 --> 00:36:10,843
Come on, sister!

402
00:36:13,345 --> 00:36:14,596
All right.

403
00:36:25,315 --> 00:36:26,108
Well, now!

404
00:36:26,358 --> 00:36:27,192
Top down!

405
00:36:29,987 --> 00:36:31,029
There she goes!

406
00:36:31,488 --> 00:36:33,448
We're doing 80 on the expressway.

407
00:36:33,699 --> 00:36:36,451
Look for 76 and the Walt Whitman.
Watch out for cops.

408
00:36:36,827 --> 00:36:38,287
We need quarters for the toll.

409
00:36:38,537 --> 00:36:40,164
No, I'll drive straight through.

410
00:36:41,748 --> 00:36:44,501
It's not my fault you left
the gate down!

411
00:36:44,751 --> 00:36:46,837
Yeah, you too, motherfucker!

412
00:36:47,129 --> 00:36:48,130
Watch out!

413
00:36:48,714 --> 00:36:50,340
That was a close one.

414
00:36:50,674 --> 00:36:51,925
Tailspin.

415
00:37:00,601 --> 00:37:01,894
We're just driving.

416
00:37:02,644 --> 00:37:03,562
Where we going?

417
00:37:04,188 --> 00:37:05,480
Where else? The ocean.

418
00:37:07,399 --> 00:37:08,525
I've never been there.

419
00:37:09,943 --> 00:37:10,861
You're kidding.

420
00:37:18,994 --> 00:37:21,747
This is great!
It's like flying in thick air!

421
00:37:22,122 --> 00:37:26,668
Are we going to go see the boardwalk
and pick up some chicks?

422
00:37:27,503 --> 00:37:30,756
Okay, just one more time,
all right? You ready?

423
00:37:31,048 --> 00:37:32,007
On your mark.

424
00:37:33,008 --> 00:37:34,468
Goddamn it!

425
00:37:37,346 --> 00:37:39,139
One Mississippi, two Mississippi...

426
00:37:39,389 --> 00:37:41,642
three Mississippi,
four Mississippi...

427
00:37:41,934 --> 00:37:43,393
five Mississippi....

428
00:37:49,608 --> 00:37:52,694
Ten Mississippi, Birdy!

429
00:37:55,989 --> 00:37:57,241
Thirteen Mississippi.

430
00:37:57,533 --> 00:38:00,536
It's a 15 Mississippi, Birdy!

431
00:38:00,786 --> 00:38:02,579
Sixteen Mississippi!

432
00:38:09,336 --> 00:38:11,839
I don't know how to swim!

433
00:38:17,928 --> 00:38:20,514
Now don't go do
anything stupid, Birdy.

434
00:38:20,806 --> 00:38:23,809
I know what's in that
goddamned fool mind of yours.

435
00:39:00,053 --> 00:39:03,390
Right down here, on this
same street, they got this ride....

436
00:39:09,313 --> 00:39:10,689
Expectant mothers, the young...

437
00:39:10,981 --> 00:39:14,443
go see the greatest attraction
in the world today.

438
00:39:14,735 --> 00:39:17,029
See Apasha, the Gorilla Girl.

439
00:39:17,321 --> 00:39:22,034
See her change from a woman
to an ape. A gorilla!

440
00:39:26,622 --> 00:39:27,873
It's gross!

441
00:39:28,248 --> 00:39:30,209
- Horrible!
- Was he born like this?

442
00:39:30,501 --> 00:39:32,586
No way, it's a gyp.
His legs are stuck.

443
00:39:32,878 --> 00:39:35,047
- It's a false bottom.
- Isn't it amazing?

444
00:39:35,464 --> 00:39:38,300
Introducing Zimmy, the human fish.

445
00:39:38,592 --> 00:39:40,844
Folks, let's hear it for Zimmy.

446
00:39:45,849 --> 00:39:47,809
- How does he do it?
- Does what?

447
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:51,605
Hold his breath so long.
I have to keep coming up for air.

448
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:54,733
We've been here four minutes.
He hasn't come up for air.

449
00:39:54,983 --> 00:39:56,693
Think he has a wife?

450
00:40:00,823 --> 00:40:02,115
You okay?

451
00:40:08,413 --> 00:40:11,500
I can hold my breath
for two minutes, 40 seconds now.

452
00:40:13,335 --> 00:40:14,628
Do you want to try?

453
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:26,390
You play sports?

454
00:40:27,307 --> 00:40:28,851
Of course not.

455
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,520
AI and I throw the discus sometimes.

456
00:40:31,812 --> 00:40:33,522
So you play on a team?

457
00:40:35,482 --> 00:40:37,985
We just throw it
to see how far it'll go.

458
00:40:39,736 --> 00:40:41,446
AI used to be on a team.

459
00:40:42,072 --> 00:40:43,782
He used to be a wrestling champ.

460
00:40:53,876 --> 00:40:55,419
Are you guys finished yet?

461
00:40:56,003 --> 00:40:56,795
I'm leaving!

462
00:40:57,087 --> 00:41:00,090
I ain't hanging around with
that creep no more!

463
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:11,476
Why do you always do this?

464
00:41:11,727 --> 00:41:12,644
You stuck me with...

465
00:41:12,936 --> 00:41:14,104
Shut up!

466
00:41:15,647 --> 00:41:17,441
What are you going to do now?

467
00:41:17,691 --> 00:41:18,901
Fuck it!

468
00:41:22,362 --> 00:41:23,363
What?

469
00:41:23,655 --> 00:41:25,449
You have got to learn...

470
00:41:25,741 --> 00:41:27,993
to be more sociable!

471
00:41:28,785 --> 00:41:30,245
I don't think she liked me.

472
00:41:30,496 --> 00:41:32,206
You got to make them like you.

473
00:41:32,498 --> 00:41:36,043
Talk like you're interested
in all that crap they go on about.

474
00:41:36,335 --> 00:41:37,878
You just got to talk more.

475
00:41:38,128 --> 00:41:41,673
I don't care about what,
as long as it's not flying and birds!

476
00:41:41,965 --> 00:41:44,176
What if that's what
I'm really thinking about?

477
00:41:44,468 --> 00:41:48,514
That's the first thing you got to
understand in your dealings with women.

478
00:41:48,764 --> 00:41:50,724
Never let them know
what you're thinking.

479
00:41:50,974 --> 00:41:52,100
I'm not thinking about them.

480
00:41:52,392 --> 00:41:54,436
Then just lie, for God sakes!

481
00:41:54,728 --> 00:41:57,564
You're the best
goddamn liar I ever met.

482
00:41:58,774 --> 00:42:01,860
Don't you know your chick
had great jugs on her?

483
00:42:03,362 --> 00:42:05,697
I don't understand.
What's the big deal?

484
00:42:05,989 --> 00:42:09,159
- They're just overgrown mammary glands.
- Mammary glands?

485
00:42:09,409 --> 00:42:11,119
Mammary glands?

486
00:42:14,373 --> 00:42:16,250
We're talking tits here!

487
00:42:16,542 --> 00:42:17,584
Big tits!

488
00:42:17,876 --> 00:42:19,253
Round tits.

489
00:42:19,545 --> 00:42:20,379
Fleshy tits.

490
00:42:20,671 --> 00:42:23,257
- Just a lot of dumb development to me.
- Full tits.

491
00:42:23,549 --> 00:42:25,425
Women carry them around
their whole lives.

492
00:42:25,676 --> 00:42:28,679
- Flopping around, getting in the way.
- They don't get in the way.

493
00:42:28,971 --> 00:42:30,848
They're needed.
They're necessary.

494
00:42:31,139 --> 00:42:34,059
I seen a picture in
National Geographic.

495
00:42:35,185 --> 00:42:37,396
Just like on a cow,
but in a more stupid place.

496
00:42:37,688 --> 00:42:39,147
It's not like a cow at all.

497
00:42:39,439 --> 00:42:40,983
I'm telling you for your own good.

498
00:42:41,275 --> 00:42:43,068
You don't know what you're missing.

499
00:42:44,653 --> 00:42:46,113
That girl, Shirley...

500
00:42:46,947 --> 00:42:48,949
l didn't even have to ask her.

501
00:42:49,533 --> 00:42:52,369
She just lifted her shirt
and put my hand under it.

502
00:42:52,619 --> 00:42:54,913
And then she undoes her bra for me.

503
00:42:55,205 --> 00:42:58,041
I start feeling the whole tit,
nipple and all.

504
00:42:58,333 --> 00:43:00,836
She's poking her tongue down my throat.

505
00:43:01,170 --> 00:43:03,922
And then, I'm reaching down
with my hand.

506
00:43:04,173 --> 00:43:05,799
I'm working my way down.
She's work...

507
00:43:06,049 --> 00:43:08,886
- That your '53 Ford back there?
- Sure, why?

508
00:43:21,273 --> 00:43:23,692
Could you stop walking around?
You make me nervous.

509
00:43:23,984 --> 00:43:26,278
I cannot stand this much longer.

510
00:43:27,529 --> 00:43:29,156
I hope your old man comes soon.

511
00:43:29,406 --> 00:43:30,324
Well, I don't.

512
00:43:40,083 --> 00:43:41,084
Hi, Dad.

513
00:43:42,002 --> 00:43:43,086
Hi, Mom.

514
00:44:40,602 --> 00:44:44,439
Ever wonder what our lives down here
must seem like to a bird?

515
00:44:44,773 --> 00:44:46,316
You two shut up!

516
00:44:52,614 --> 00:44:54,658
Fucking fuck!
I'm always fucked!

517
00:44:59,997 --> 00:45:01,707
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

518
00:45:28,609 --> 00:45:30,486
Hi, Al. How are you?

519
00:45:31,236 --> 00:45:33,322
I'm pretty good, Birdy, thanks.

520
00:45:34,156 --> 00:45:35,282
You know, Al...

521
00:45:35,574 --> 00:45:38,076
I'm glad you came to see me.

522
00:45:38,368 --> 00:45:40,078
We haven't seen each other
in a while...

523
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:42,706
and there's a lot of water
under the bridge.

524
00:45:42,998 --> 00:45:46,084
But it's good just to sit here
and not talk with you.

525
00:45:46,793 --> 00:45:49,713
Yeah, it's a real blast.
But, you know....

526
00:45:49,963 --> 00:45:52,007
Come on, Birdy!

527
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:54,510
Talk to me.

528
00:45:57,137 --> 00:45:59,181
Okay, don't talk to me.

529
00:46:00,516 --> 00:46:02,392
You think I don't know
what you're doing...

530
00:46:02,684 --> 00:46:05,771
with this squatting
and sideways staring stuff?

531
00:46:06,855 --> 00:46:09,858
So you're finally a bird.
Big deal!

532
00:46:11,735 --> 00:46:14,655
If Weiss finds out, he'll put
you in a display case...

533
00:46:14,947 --> 00:46:16,740
and write papers on you forever.

534
00:47:02,327 --> 00:47:04,329
Damn cats are driving me crazy!

535
00:47:04,621 --> 00:47:06,790
I'll get a BB gun and pop them off.

536
00:47:07,082 --> 00:47:10,878
They'll give the birds a heart attack,
scaring them all day.

537
00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:14,256
Let's get this door closed
so they don't get out here.

538
00:47:14,756 --> 00:47:15,883
That's it.

539
00:47:17,259 --> 00:47:18,886
You know my mother.

540
00:47:19,136 --> 00:47:21,013
And that's Mr. Tate.

541
00:47:21,471 --> 00:47:23,182
He's deaf.
He doesn't hear anything.

542
00:47:23,473 --> 00:47:25,601
He loves the birds singing,
like Beethoven.

543
00:47:25,893 --> 00:47:27,102
I said you're like Beethoven.

544
00:47:35,611 --> 00:47:37,321
You like that one, huh?

545
00:47:37,613 --> 00:47:39,656
She's a good-looker, all right.

546
00:47:39,948 --> 00:47:43,118
But don't go for flyers when
you're looking for a good breeder.

547
00:47:46,497 --> 00:47:47,748
Come on, honey.

548
00:47:48,749 --> 00:47:49,750
Come here.

549
00:47:51,502 --> 00:47:53,128
Don't you want to eat?

550
00:47:53,712 --> 00:47:56,798
She's a pretty one,
but won't notice any of the daddies.

551
00:47:57,049 --> 00:47:59,259
She's a heartbreaker.
So particular!

552
00:47:59,551 --> 00:48:01,887
Rhett and Ashley can't get near her.

553
00:48:02,221 --> 00:48:04,264
It sure ain't like in the movie.

554
00:48:04,556 --> 00:48:07,559
I don't let them mate
more than one at a time.

555
00:48:07,809 --> 00:48:09,353
No brothers and sisters.

556
00:48:09,645 --> 00:48:11,980
It ain't right.
Says so in the Bible.

557
00:48:12,272 --> 00:48:13,148
Mr. Tate...

558
00:48:13,982 --> 00:48:16,735
lets them all in together,
like a Roman orgy.

559
00:48:16,985 --> 00:48:18,529
Ain't natural.

560
00:48:21,198 --> 00:48:21,990
Here's Melanie.

561
00:48:22,282 --> 00:48:23,992
Come here, Melanie.

562
00:48:24,243 --> 00:48:25,619
The first day I saw Perta...

563
00:48:26,286 --> 00:48:28,372
l knew she was special.

564
00:48:28,705 --> 00:48:30,666
The way she took to the air...

565
00:48:30,958 --> 00:48:32,668
Iike it was hers.

566
00:48:39,174 --> 00:48:40,884
She likes you.

567
00:48:41,134 --> 00:48:43,262
Don't get taken in
'cause she's a flyer.

568
00:48:43,554 --> 00:48:47,474
Melanie here, she's a darling bird.
Every bit as pretty.

569
00:48:47,766 --> 00:48:49,643
No, I'll take this one.

570
00:48:54,064 --> 00:48:55,858
You can't do anything about it.

571
00:48:56,150 --> 00:48:58,235
He sold it before he ever
told me about it.

572
00:48:58,527 --> 00:49:00,779
At least we got
what we paid for the car.

573
00:49:01,071 --> 00:49:04,158
I'll give you my share.
We can use it for your ornithopter.

574
00:49:04,408 --> 00:49:05,868
I don't care about the money.

575
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:07,327
It's the principle of the thing.

576
00:49:07,619 --> 00:49:10,706
The only principle is my old man
does whatever he wants.

577
00:49:10,956 --> 00:49:13,792
Do you want me to pin him?
I wish I could, but I can't!

578
00:49:14,084 --> 00:49:15,127
We're going to get it back.

579
00:49:15,419 --> 00:49:18,172
Are you crazy? Suicidal?
He doesn't even like you.

580
00:49:18,422 --> 00:49:19,631
He'll break your neck.

581
00:49:19,923 --> 00:49:20,799
I don't care.

582
00:49:21,091 --> 00:49:22,050
It's our car.

583
00:49:22,342 --> 00:49:24,386
You can't do this.
You know what he's like.

584
00:49:24,678 --> 00:49:25,888
I tell you, he'll kill you!

585
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:28,432
Jesus, sometimes you're
so full of shit!

586
00:49:28,724 --> 00:49:30,726
All right, but you're on your own.

587
00:49:31,018 --> 00:49:32,477
I'm not going with you.

588
00:49:32,769 --> 00:49:35,439
I don't want blood
splattered all over me.

589
00:49:37,357 --> 00:49:38,150
Shit!

590
00:49:42,321 --> 00:49:44,364
- I want the car back.
- What do you mean?

591
00:49:44,656 --> 00:49:47,409
- You got your money!
- You had no right to sell it!

592
00:49:47,701 --> 00:49:49,244
It's worth more than the money!

593
00:49:49,536 --> 00:49:51,497
It belongs to us.
We didn't want to...!

594
00:49:51,747 --> 00:49:53,916
That car was in my name.
I'll sell it to whoever.

595
00:49:54,208 --> 00:49:57,211
Would you get out of here?
I'm trying to read my paper.

596
00:49:57,628 --> 00:50:00,547
Tell me the man's name
who thinks he bought it...!

597
00:50:00,797 --> 00:50:02,508
Get out of here. I'll call the cops!

598
00:50:02,799 --> 00:50:06,470
I was about to do that myself!
I'd like to report a stolen car!

599
00:50:06,762 --> 00:50:09,431
Are you calling me
a crook in my own house?!

600
00:50:09,681 --> 00:50:11,225
Are you crazy?!

601
00:50:11,475 --> 00:50:13,894
Are you trying to say
I stole that junk heap?!

602
00:50:14,186 --> 00:50:16,688
Don't embarrass me
in front of my family!

603
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:19,024
You sold something that wasn't yours!

604
00:50:19,316 --> 00:50:21,735
Give me the man's name
who thinks he bought it!

605
00:50:22,027 --> 00:50:23,237
I'll tell him you made a mistake!

606
00:50:23,529 --> 00:50:26,365
I sold the car to a friend
of my brother-in-law!

607
00:50:26,657 --> 00:50:29,326
This guy is not
giving you the car back!

608
00:50:29,618 --> 00:50:33,205
You mess around with him and you'll
wind up in a concrete shirt...

609
00:50:33,497 --> 00:50:34,790
at the bottom of the river!

610
00:50:35,082 --> 00:50:36,875
I don't want to go to the police...

611
00:50:37,125 --> 00:50:39,962
but I got a receipt of purchase
from Mr. Russo...

612
00:50:40,212 --> 00:50:41,213
at the junkyard!

613
00:50:41,505 --> 00:50:44,174
You think it's yours
because you registered it for us.

614
00:50:44,424 --> 00:50:47,803
It's legally ours because
you don't got no proof-of-purchase!

615
00:50:48,095 --> 00:50:50,138
Why do you want to be a hard-nose for?

616
00:50:50,430 --> 00:50:52,224
I can't get you the car back...

617
00:50:52,516 --> 00:50:55,185
even if I wanted to!
- So tell me his name!

618
00:50:55,435 --> 00:50:58,438
Shut up, you skinny bucket of piss!

619
00:50:58,730 --> 00:51:00,941
You're not worth going
to jail for, for murder.

620
00:51:01,233 --> 00:51:02,067
Here's what I'll do.

621
00:51:02,359 --> 00:51:04,153
- Here's the money.
- I don't want it.

622
00:51:04,403 --> 00:51:06,446
- That's all I got...
- It wasn't yours to sell!

623
00:51:06,738 --> 00:51:07,865
Shut the fuck up!

624
00:51:08,157 --> 00:51:10,033
He's going to take it.

625
00:51:10,659 --> 00:51:13,495
Read your paper, honey. Please.
He'll take the money.

626
00:51:13,787 --> 00:51:15,080
You'll take the money.

627
00:51:15,372 --> 00:51:17,791
I'll get you more from
my brother if you want.

628
00:51:18,876 --> 00:51:21,545
Don't make no trouble.
Please!

629
00:51:24,464 --> 00:51:26,008
Here.
I don't want it.

630
00:51:26,633 --> 00:51:28,510
Half of it's yours.
You deserve it.

631
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:30,220
It was our car, Al.

632
00:51:32,139 --> 00:51:35,642
I could never stand up
to my old man like that.

633
00:51:35,934 --> 00:51:37,477
Maybe life is shitty.

634
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:40,063
It is shitty.

635
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:44,776
I'll tell you something.

636
00:51:46,236 --> 00:51:48,780
I'm not trying to pin life anymore.

637
00:51:49,364 --> 00:51:51,700
I don't even fucking understand it.

638
00:51:52,326 --> 00:51:56,163
I just want to make it through with
some dignity, like everybody else.

639
00:51:58,540 --> 00:52:02,419
Of course, if there was any real
dignity, there wouldn't be any sex.

640
00:52:05,255 --> 00:52:07,341
I'm going to go now, all right?

641
00:52:17,893 --> 00:52:18,936
All right?

642
00:52:23,941 --> 00:52:25,651
But I'll be back.

643
00:52:38,413 --> 00:52:39,540
Renaldi!

644
00:52:43,210 --> 00:52:45,629
Let me out! Let me out!
Let me out!

645
00:53:37,389 --> 00:53:38,765
You okay, Al?

646
00:53:39,057 --> 00:53:42,394
You were moaning as if in pain.
Is your face bothering you?

647
00:53:42,728 --> 00:53:46,190
- You won't tell anyone about this?
- No, of course not.

648
00:53:52,821 --> 00:53:54,281
No, sir, not yet.

649
00:53:55,699 --> 00:53:57,409
Yeah, he's here right now.

650
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:01,413
His file came in this morning.

651
00:54:04,541 --> 00:54:06,335
Would you come over here, please?

652
00:54:24,394 --> 00:54:29,024
Is your serial number
10107003 or 10107008?

653
00:54:31,401 --> 00:54:33,362
It's 003. Why?

654
00:54:33,821 --> 00:54:35,823
I want to get it right.

655
00:54:37,908 --> 00:54:41,703
It's C-O-L-U-M-B-A-T-O,
Sergeant Alfonso?

656
00:54:44,748 --> 00:54:46,917
What is this?
Am I being taken prisoner?

657
00:54:47,376 --> 00:54:49,711
The major wants some more
information on you.

658
00:54:51,755 --> 00:54:52,881
What do you got, my file?

659
00:54:54,550 --> 00:54:56,677
Everything about you.

660
00:55:09,148 --> 00:55:10,524
There we go.

661
00:55:15,404 --> 00:55:18,407
Is there any history of insanity
in your family?

662
00:55:19,158 --> 00:55:19,992
No.

663
00:55:20,284 --> 00:55:21,326
Why are you asking me?

664
00:55:21,618 --> 00:55:22,911
Suicides?

665
00:55:23,203 --> 00:55:23,996
What?

666
00:55:24,288 --> 00:55:25,205
Any suicides?

667
00:55:25,873 --> 00:55:26,832
Not yet.

668
00:55:32,588 --> 00:55:34,882
Finish that later.
Bring me what you've got.

669
00:55:35,174 --> 00:55:36,466
Come on in.

670
00:55:48,687 --> 00:55:49,688
Excuse me, Major.

671
00:55:50,314 --> 00:55:51,940
Is something wrong
with your secretary?

672
00:55:53,901 --> 00:55:55,444
Oh, you mean the spitting.

673
00:55:55,694 --> 00:55:58,947
Ever since combat,
he's had a bad taste in his mouth.

674
00:55:59,239 --> 00:56:02,618
Don't worry. We're working on him.
Have a seat.

675
00:56:06,788 --> 00:56:09,458
Why was he asking me
all those questions?

676
00:56:10,042 --> 00:56:11,126
I'm not a patient here.

677
00:56:11,418 --> 00:56:13,670
I like to know who I'm dealing with.

678
00:56:14,963 --> 00:56:16,757
How do you think
the Army's treated you?

679
00:56:17,674 --> 00:56:20,093
Not bad. Okay, I guess.

680
00:56:21,303 --> 00:56:23,597
It says you attacked
a superior officer...

681
00:56:23,889 --> 00:56:25,682
just after you arrived in Saigon.

682
00:56:26,350 --> 00:56:27,976
We were in a bar.

683
00:56:29,144 --> 00:56:30,145
I just hit him.

684
00:56:30,437 --> 00:56:32,481
You knocked out four teeth
and broke his nose.

685
00:56:32,773 --> 00:56:34,733
I hit him hard.
He was dogging me.

686
00:56:35,192 --> 00:56:37,736
- You think you might have overreacted?
- Maybe.

687
00:56:38,487 --> 00:56:40,197
Sir, we all make mistakes.

688
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:44,284
But it's important to learn
from our mistakes. Don't you think?

689
00:56:44,827 --> 00:56:47,663
Shouldn't we be talking
about the patient here?

690
00:56:49,915 --> 00:56:52,751
Whose idea was it to steal that car?
Yours or his?

691
00:56:53,001 --> 00:56:54,294
Steal a car?

692
00:56:54,586 --> 00:56:56,630
I believe it was in Atlantic City.

693
00:56:57,089 --> 00:56:58,131
Oh, that!

694
00:56:58,423 --> 00:56:59,967
That was a misunderstanding.

695
00:57:00,259 --> 00:57:02,511
My father had it registered
in his name.

696
00:57:02,803 --> 00:57:05,013
We were having a good time, you know.

697
00:57:05,305 --> 00:57:07,015
Is that how your father saw it?

698
00:57:07,891 --> 00:57:09,101
No, not exactly.

699
00:57:09,726 --> 00:57:10,769
What did he do?

700
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:13,272
He took away my allowance.

701
00:57:13,564 --> 00:57:14,690
Listen, you wise guy.

702
00:57:14,982 --> 00:57:17,734
I've got better things to do
than play games with you!

703
00:57:18,026 --> 00:57:19,736
I should probably
send you back.

704
00:57:19,987 --> 00:57:21,446
You don't have to do that, sir.

705
00:57:22,072 --> 00:57:23,615
Maybe you haven't noticed...

706
00:57:23,907 --> 00:57:27,452
what happens to men like your friend,
without special attention.

707
00:57:28,453 --> 00:57:29,246
What do you mean?

708
00:57:29,538 --> 00:57:31,331
They stay here for
the rest of their lives.

709
00:57:31,582 --> 00:57:33,584
They rot.
Sometimes they just die.

710
00:57:34,418 --> 00:57:38,172
I'm sure I can get through to him.
I just need some more time.

711
00:57:40,757 --> 00:57:42,467
All right, sergeant.

712
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:45,804
This is not an
indefinite stay for you.

713
00:57:46,430 --> 00:57:47,389
You can go.

714
00:57:50,934 --> 00:57:52,311
One more thing.

715
00:57:53,770 --> 00:57:56,523
Did you or your friend
resent your father...

716
00:57:56,815 --> 00:57:59,026
for that misunderstanding
about the car?

717
00:58:00,027 --> 00:58:00,986
No, sir.

718
00:58:01,278 --> 00:58:03,572
We both really liked my father.

719
00:58:04,031 --> 00:58:05,657
He was a heck of a guy.

720
00:58:29,223 --> 00:58:30,933
Not so bad, right?

721
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:37,773
Oh, shit! I should be done
with him by now.

722
00:58:38,232 --> 00:58:40,234
Would you feed him
while I go finish up?

723
00:58:40,526 --> 00:58:41,485
- Sure.
- Thanks.

724
00:58:41,777 --> 00:58:42,736
Take this.

725
00:58:43,028 --> 00:58:44,404
I'll be right back.

726
00:58:49,034 --> 00:58:51,703
I saw that cockeyed look of yours.

727
00:58:51,995 --> 00:58:54,039
That look always means something.

728
00:58:54,331 --> 00:58:56,625
You think I was hitting on her,
don't you?

729
00:58:56,917 --> 00:58:58,794
You think maybe she likes me?

730
00:59:01,129 --> 00:59:03,715
You really got to quit it
with this crap.

731
00:59:04,383 --> 00:59:06,176
I got to get out of here.

732
00:59:06,468 --> 00:59:08,637
That shrink gives me the eye
like I'm crazy.

733
00:59:08,929 --> 00:59:10,138
It's not a great feeling.

734
00:59:10,430 --> 00:59:12,683
Not that it ever
seemed to bother you.

735
00:59:14,810 --> 00:59:16,687
Come on, Birdy, eat it.

736
00:59:17,646 --> 00:59:20,190
If you could see yourself
squatting here...

737
00:59:20,482 --> 00:59:22,943
and me shovelling
this crap down your throat...

738
00:59:23,235 --> 00:59:25,320
you'd probably laugh
yourself to death.

739
00:59:27,698 --> 00:59:28,699
What?

740
00:59:31,493 --> 00:59:34,830
I won't have another
talking-to-the-wall conversation.

741
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:36,874
Decide if you're listening or not.

742
00:59:42,963 --> 00:59:44,506
We'll do it your way.

743
00:59:45,299 --> 00:59:48,302
We'll sit here and commune
like goddamn birds.

744
01:01:07,297 --> 01:01:08,590
Hey, pretty.

745
01:01:13,303 --> 01:01:14,346
Come here.

746
01:01:18,976 --> 01:01:20,060
How do you do that?

747
01:01:26,441 --> 01:01:29,695
Your mother said enough for tonight.
It's almost 3 o'clock.

748
01:01:30,863 --> 01:01:32,656
I'm working on my ornithop...

749
01:01:32,948 --> 01:01:35,409
Come on, enough's enough!
We're supposed to be asleep!

750
01:01:35,784 --> 01:01:37,578
Tell him.
You're his father.

751
01:01:37,870 --> 01:01:39,037
Come on, son.

752
01:01:39,329 --> 01:01:40,956
Leave the bird alone.

753
01:01:45,711 --> 01:01:47,754
Then the bird's feather.

754
01:01:48,046 --> 01:01:51,758
It has a hollow shaft, with
feeders for blood circulation.

755
01:01:52,050 --> 01:01:54,720
On either side are branches, barbs...

756
01:01:55,262 --> 01:01:57,055
which branch into barbules...

757
01:01:57,306 --> 01:02:00,225
which have little barbicels
with hooks on the end of them.

758
01:02:00,517 --> 01:02:03,520
It can all be pulled apart,
like a zipper.

759
01:02:06,690 --> 01:02:07,900
And then re-zipped.

760
01:02:08,192 --> 01:02:10,402
A bird runs its beak
through its feather...

761
01:02:10,694 --> 01:02:13,030
re-zipping feathers
that have come apart.

762
01:02:13,447 --> 01:02:15,657
Flying is much more than flapping wings.

763
01:02:15,949 --> 01:02:18,327
A bird can flap its wings
and not move an inch.

764
01:02:18,619 --> 01:02:19,995
When it wants to fly...

765
01:02:20,287 --> 01:02:23,373
the slightest flicker
sends it up to the sky.

766
01:02:24,875 --> 01:02:27,961
You must feel that air has substance
and can hold you up.

767
01:02:29,129 --> 01:02:31,423
It's mostly a matter of confidence.

768
01:02:47,523 --> 01:02:49,483
Fuck them.
What do they know, anyway?

769
01:02:49,775 --> 01:02:52,861
Did you notice Doris Robinson
giving you the eye?

770
01:02:53,111 --> 01:02:55,656
She must be hot for
mad-scientist types.

771
01:02:55,948 --> 01:02:58,283
- You ought to ask her out.
- I don't think so.

772
01:02:58,575 --> 01:03:00,369
I can't afford to take her out.

773
01:03:00,619 --> 01:03:02,412
It doesn't cost anything.

774
01:03:02,704 --> 01:03:05,165
You think Cheryl's charging me for it?

775
01:03:05,457 --> 01:03:07,709
I'll go to the cafeteria.
You want to come?

776
01:03:08,001 --> 01:03:10,671
I want to go down and talk to my dad.

777
01:03:22,641 --> 01:03:23,767
Dad?

778
01:03:26,979 --> 01:03:27,896
Dad!

779
01:03:28,188 --> 01:03:29,231
I'm in here.

780
01:03:30,941 --> 01:03:32,109
Come on in.

781
01:03:37,072 --> 01:03:38,866
You had lunch yet?

782
01:03:39,116 --> 01:03:41,243
- I'm not hungry.
- You got to eat.

783
01:03:41,535 --> 01:03:43,579
Grab a sandwich and sit down.

784
01:03:44,621 --> 01:03:45,414
Dad...

785
01:03:45,706 --> 01:03:47,249
l want to ask you a question.

786
01:03:47,958 --> 01:03:49,084
Shoot.

787
01:03:49,543 --> 01:03:52,045
I want another canary,
a male for mating.

788
01:03:52,337 --> 01:03:53,964
Maybe you can talk to Mom.

789
01:03:54,256 --> 01:03:56,675
I don't know.
We don't want to antagonize her.

790
01:03:57,467 --> 01:04:00,554
I had a heck of a time getting her
to let you build the aviary.

791
01:04:00,846 --> 01:04:02,389
She's worried...

792
01:04:02,681 --> 01:04:04,641
about what it's costing
for the feed...

793
01:04:04,933 --> 01:04:06,310
the lumber and whatnot.

794
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:08,187
The birdseed's cheap.

795
01:04:08,479 --> 01:04:11,565
- AI and I swipe the lumber.
- I sure won't tell her that.

796
01:04:11,857 --> 01:04:14,067
She's convinced
your friend is AI Capone.

797
01:04:14,359 --> 01:04:15,319
I know.

798
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:18,697
Don't think your mom
doesn't want what's best.

799
01:04:18,989 --> 01:04:21,575
She's concerned that you develop
interests and friends...

800
01:04:21,867 --> 01:04:23,869
that'll help you fit in.

801
01:04:24,620 --> 01:04:25,579
Fit into what?

802
01:04:25,871 --> 01:04:27,831
Whatever. You know, life.

803
01:04:28,123 --> 01:04:30,709
She thinks I won't fit
in with AI and a canary?

804
01:04:31,835 --> 01:04:33,962
It's not that.
It's just, well....

805
01:04:34,254 --> 01:04:35,464
Take me.

806
01:04:35,797 --> 01:04:38,342
I've always had an interest in wicker.

807
01:04:38,634 --> 01:04:41,053
When I met your mom,
I could make a better wicker chair...

808
01:04:41,345 --> 01:04:43,388
than any man in Philadelphia.

809
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:46,183
I still could, if anybody wanted one.

810
01:04:46,475 --> 01:04:49,061
But nobody cares about wicker anymore.

811
01:04:49,353 --> 01:04:51,730
So I don't fit into
the scheme of things.

812
01:04:52,022 --> 01:04:53,482
You see what I'm saying?

813
01:04:53,774 --> 01:04:56,610
Your mother just wants you
to wind up better than me.

814
01:04:57,402 --> 01:04:59,196
Every parent wants that.

815
01:04:59,780 --> 01:05:04,576
I'm just saying you should be
interested in something practical too.

816
01:05:06,870 --> 01:05:09,790
It's hard to be good
at something nobody wants, huh?

817
01:05:13,460 --> 01:05:15,254
You really want this, don't you?

818
01:05:20,175 --> 01:05:21,635
I'll talk with your mom.

819
01:05:34,523 --> 01:05:37,526
Don't worry, I won't let him out
till you're sure of him.

820
01:05:42,656 --> 01:05:44,283
I think he's mostly bluff.

821
01:05:49,830 --> 01:05:51,206
How you doing?

822
01:05:51,456 --> 01:05:53,458
You got another one!

823
01:05:55,127 --> 01:05:57,087
- His name's Alfonso.
- What?

824
01:05:58,297 --> 01:06:00,007
He likes to fight and show off a lot.

825
01:06:00,257 --> 01:06:02,217
You named him after me.
Thanks a lot.

826
01:06:02,509 --> 01:06:05,762
- It's not really his real name.
- What's his real name?

827
01:06:06,555 --> 01:06:08,807
I don't know.
I don't speak canary yet.

828
01:06:17,816 --> 01:06:18,942
Fuck!

829
01:06:22,446 --> 01:06:24,406
This is getting weird.

830
01:06:25,991 --> 01:06:27,618
Didn't I tell you to stop that?

831
01:06:28,035 --> 01:06:29,828
I told you, Mom.
It's for gym.

832
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:31,914
I don't know.
It looks crazy.

833
01:06:32,539 --> 01:06:33,999
She's calling you crazy.

834
01:06:34,249 --> 01:06:38,378
Ask her what she's been doing
with our baseballs all these years!

835
01:06:39,254 --> 01:06:42,508
I think she buries them.
We just have to find out where.

836
01:06:42,966 --> 01:06:46,136
I think she burns them.
We'll never find them.

837
01:06:46,386 --> 01:06:48,096
Yeah, probably.

838
01:06:52,810 --> 01:06:53,685
How long?

839
01:06:53,977 --> 01:06:54,812
Same.

840
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:56,063
An hour.

841
01:06:56,355 --> 01:06:57,815
I'm up to 10 pounds.

842
01:06:58,106 --> 01:07:02,653
With that and all the weight you lost,
you could really clean up in wrestling.

843
01:07:03,070 --> 01:07:06,406
Do you realize that's 40 pounds
of flapping power?

844
01:07:07,658 --> 01:07:09,993
You won't fly any more than I could.

845
01:07:10,285 --> 01:07:13,539
You couldn't fly because
you don't believe you could fly.

846
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:28,303
It's a snake!

847
01:07:29,513 --> 01:07:31,056
Damn snake!

848
01:07:33,725 --> 01:07:35,519
Got its whole foot in its mouth.

849
01:07:43,026 --> 01:07:44,653
It must have been two feet long.

850
01:07:44,945 --> 01:07:48,282
- I think it was a rat snake.
- I don't believe you.

851
01:07:49,992 --> 01:07:52,995
- It was that long!
- Yeah, right.

852
01:07:53,871 --> 01:07:56,039
Are we getting started or what?

853
01:07:56,915 --> 01:07:59,585
Patience, Al.
You just got to have patience.

854
01:08:00,335 --> 01:08:01,712
This place is a garbage dump.

855
01:08:02,004 --> 01:08:03,463
Four, five, six....

856
01:08:03,714 --> 01:08:04,756
It smells.

857
01:08:05,048 --> 01:08:06,592
Nine, ten, eleven....

858
01:08:06,884 --> 01:08:08,760
You sure this is going to work?

859
01:08:09,636 --> 01:08:10,679
Sixteen.

860
01:08:10,971 --> 01:08:13,891
Stop at the edge. I don't want you
or my bike in the water.

861
01:08:14,141 --> 01:08:15,767
How about you?

862
01:08:16,143 --> 01:08:17,686
I've been practising off my roof.

863
01:08:17,978 --> 01:08:20,189
I can fall 20 feet
without hurting myself.

864
01:08:20,481 --> 01:08:23,317
That's got to be
a 40-foot drop out there.

865
01:08:23,692 --> 01:08:26,361
It's all a matter of weight
versus density.

866
01:08:26,612 --> 01:08:29,281
At my weight,
travelling at 32 feet a second...

867
01:08:29,531 --> 01:08:32,784
my downward velocity
won't increase after I fall 20 feet.

868
01:08:33,076 --> 01:08:34,536
What does that mean?

869
01:08:34,786 --> 01:08:38,207
The worst thing that can happen
is I get the wind knocked out of me.

870
01:08:38,499 --> 01:08:40,918
It won't happen.
I'm going to fly.

871
01:08:41,210 --> 01:08:42,002
How do I look?

872
01:08:42,294 --> 01:08:43,337
Dumb.

873
01:08:45,380 --> 01:08:46,381
Ready.

874
01:08:53,764 --> 01:08:54,556
Faster!

875
01:08:54,848 --> 01:08:56,016
Faster!

876
01:09:18,872 --> 01:09:19,748
Birdy!

877
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:20,999
I'm coming!

878
01:09:21,333 --> 01:09:22,709
Just hold on!

879
01:09:28,048 --> 01:09:29,591
Are you okay?

880
01:09:31,134 --> 01:09:32,094
Yeah.

881
01:09:32,386 --> 01:09:33,178
Are you?

882
01:09:33,470 --> 01:09:34,388
Sure.

883
01:09:35,639 --> 01:09:38,809
I don't know what happened.
I was going really good and just...

884
01:09:39,434 --> 01:09:41,145
fell out of the sky.

885
01:09:43,105 --> 01:09:43,897
Gesundheit.

886
01:09:52,948 --> 01:09:55,450
How come every time
I tried to save your ass...

887
01:09:55,742 --> 01:09:57,703
l ended up getting sick?

888
01:10:00,956 --> 01:10:02,916
You thought that was funny, huh?

889
01:10:05,377 --> 01:10:08,130
Who are you supposed to be,
the Mona Lisa or what?

890
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:11,884
That is a smile, isn't it?

891
01:10:16,972 --> 01:10:18,765
" Dissociative behaviour"?

892
01:10:19,057 --> 01:10:21,226
- A smile's a smile.
- Not necessarily.

893
01:10:21,518 --> 01:10:25,481
It might be an involuntary manifestation
of some unconnected emotion.

894
01:10:25,772 --> 01:10:27,774
To be significant,
it must be reactionary.

895
01:10:28,066 --> 01:10:29,151
He was reacting.

896
01:10:29,443 --> 01:10:30,486
To what?

897
01:10:30,944 --> 01:10:32,988
- The joke.
- What joke?

898
01:10:34,114 --> 01:10:36,408
I always got sick when he was hurt.

899
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:38,160
Do you think he smiled at that?

900
01:10:38,410 --> 01:10:39,953
It's a private joke.

901
01:10:40,204 --> 01:10:42,080
Why don't you explain it to me?

902
01:10:42,998 --> 01:10:45,334
I don't know if I can.
It's complicated.

903
01:10:46,835 --> 01:10:49,922
I wish this gave me hope,
but there's no concrete progress.

904
01:10:50,172 --> 01:10:52,049
He's more responsive to drug therapy...

905
01:10:52,341 --> 01:10:53,133
Yeah, right!

906
01:10:53,425 --> 01:10:56,595
You pump him up so full of shit,
he doesn't know who he is!

907
01:10:56,887 --> 01:10:58,514
Who do you think you are?

908
01:10:58,764 --> 01:11:01,308
I'm his doctor
and your superior officer!

909
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:05,103
I am familiar with your
anti-authoritarian tendencies!

910
01:11:05,395 --> 01:11:07,898
And I don't care to see them here!

911
01:11:09,900 --> 01:11:13,695
Why do you think it's difficult for you
to control your violent impulses?

912
01:11:13,987 --> 01:11:14,947
It's not.

913
01:11:15,239 --> 01:11:17,241
Then why do they keep recurring?

914
01:11:19,201 --> 01:11:20,410
Look...

915
01:11:20,702 --> 01:11:21,620
l'm sorry.

916
01:11:21,912 --> 01:11:23,455
I'm frustrated.

917
01:11:23,705 --> 01:11:25,165
I just want to help my friend.

918
01:11:25,415 --> 01:11:26,875
I don't think you can anymore.

919
01:11:27,125 --> 01:11:28,377
I can. I know it.

920
01:11:28,794 --> 01:11:30,796
Sorry, I don't see any point to this.

921
01:11:31,421 --> 01:11:33,423
It's time you return to Fort Dix.

922
01:11:33,715 --> 01:11:36,468
It's time for your bandages to come off.

923
01:11:36,718 --> 01:11:37,761
Excuse me.

924
01:11:38,679 --> 01:11:41,431
Ronsky, see Sergeant Columbato out,
would you?

925
01:11:50,399 --> 01:11:54,027
You wanted me to remember something
about his past that might help.

926
01:11:54,319 --> 01:11:56,029
Well, there is one thing.

927
01:11:56,321 --> 01:11:58,198
It sounds a little crazy, but...

928
01:11:58,490 --> 01:12:01,743
He lived just over the field fence
of our baseball park.

929
01:12:02,035 --> 01:12:05,038
When anyone hit a homer,
his mother hid the balls.

930
01:12:05,330 --> 01:12:07,207
She wouldn't give them up.
It's weird.

931
01:12:07,499 --> 01:12:09,459
It's almost like
he felt guilty about it.

932
01:12:09,710 --> 01:12:13,839
He was always apologizing to somebody,
swearing he'd get their balls back.

933
01:12:14,089 --> 01:12:17,009
It was an obsession.
He spent hours looking for them.

934
01:12:17,259 --> 01:12:19,219
We figured maybe she buried them.

935
01:12:19,469 --> 01:12:22,014
He never found them.
I was wondering...

936
01:12:22,306 --> 01:12:25,142
if she sends them here,
that might do something.

937
01:12:25,434 --> 01:12:27,060
How long ago was this?

938
01:12:27,352 --> 01:12:29,062
All through high school, sir.

939
01:12:29,354 --> 01:12:32,357
There must be a lot of baseballs
in that collection.

940
01:12:32,941 --> 01:12:36,403
I'll extend your visit till
I find out about these baseballs.

941
01:12:36,695 --> 01:12:38,989
- I hope this works.
- Me too.

942
01:13:06,141 --> 01:13:07,768
- How's it going?
- How you doing?

943
01:13:08,018 --> 01:13:10,437
- Just shooting some hoops.
- Fucking A!

944
01:13:50,018 --> 01:13:53,355
Funny, any other war,
we would've been heroes.

945
01:13:56,316 --> 01:13:57,526
Oh, man!

946
01:13:58,694 --> 01:14:03,073
We didn't know what we were getting
into with this John Wayne shit.

947
01:14:10,330 --> 01:14:12,040
Boy, were we dumb!

948
01:14:16,962 --> 01:14:18,755
We were always dumb.

949
01:14:19,631 --> 01:14:22,801
Before the government, it was
some asshole on a street corner.

950
01:14:27,973 --> 01:14:30,142
Remember with Sagessa and the dogs?

951
01:14:43,614 --> 01:14:45,699
Somebody buys a cute puppy
for Christmas.

952
01:14:46,450 --> 01:14:50,329
Once they find out how much it eats
and shits, they dump it cross-town.

953
01:14:50,621 --> 01:14:54,208
Soon you got packs of wild dogs,
big, hungry and not so cute.

954
01:14:54,500 --> 01:14:57,503
- People want to shoot them.
- How do you find homes for the dogs?

955
01:14:57,753 --> 01:15:00,172
If I tell you that, you don't need me.

956
01:15:00,464 --> 01:15:04,218
You forget my dollar-a-dog proposition.
You go into business for yourself.

957
01:15:04,510 --> 01:15:05,969
This ain't like you, Sagessa.

958
01:15:06,261 --> 01:15:08,347
Since when were you out to make
the world better?

959
01:15:08,639 --> 01:15:10,933
You never heard of
enlightened self-interest?

960
01:15:11,225 --> 01:15:12,601
The way I got it figured...

961
01:15:12,893 --> 01:15:16,438
we're doing a good deed
and making a buck besides.

962
01:15:19,441 --> 01:15:20,651
There's one!

963
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:34,122
These dogs can really bite.

964
01:15:35,749 --> 01:15:37,709
There she is! Watch this.

965
01:15:39,586 --> 01:15:40,838
Go slow.

966
01:15:45,884 --> 01:15:47,427
Okay, watch me now.

967
01:15:48,095 --> 01:15:50,097
Slow and dangerous.

968
01:15:51,223 --> 01:15:53,392
You got to let them know who you are.

969
01:16:01,733 --> 01:16:02,943
Okay now.

970
01:16:03,235 --> 01:16:04,278
Watch me.

971
01:16:08,615 --> 01:16:09,658
Shit!

972
01:16:10,075 --> 01:16:11,118
Dollar a dog.

973
01:16:13,620 --> 01:16:15,164
All right, we got them now.

974
01:16:15,414 --> 01:16:17,708
I'll take this mean one.
He's the leader.

975
01:16:25,757 --> 01:16:26,550
Damn it!

976
01:16:47,654 --> 01:16:48,697
Shit!

977
01:16:56,830 --> 01:16:58,040
Lift him up!

978
01:17:03,128 --> 01:17:04,046
Grab that one.

979
01:17:22,022 --> 01:17:23,148
Where we going?

980
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:26,610
That's my department. Do you want
to get out of here or what?

981
01:17:26,860 --> 01:17:28,487
I just thought this was some...

982
01:17:28,821 --> 01:17:30,781
You sons of bitches!
You got my dog!

983
01:17:31,406 --> 01:17:33,617
My dog is in the goddamn truck!

984
01:17:35,035 --> 01:17:35,869
He's crazy!

985
01:17:42,334 --> 01:17:43,210
You got my dog!

986
01:17:50,634 --> 01:17:51,593
What's your problem?

987
01:17:51,885 --> 01:17:54,972
You got my dog in the back
of your truck, you little shit!

988
01:17:55,264 --> 01:17:58,433
If it's his dog, you should stop
and give it to him.

989
01:17:58,725 --> 01:18:00,686
- Bullshit, we're almost there.
- Where?

990
01:18:30,716 --> 01:18:31,717
Jesus!

991
01:18:32,968 --> 01:18:34,511
What is this place?

992
01:18:37,681 --> 01:18:39,975
I've never seen so many flies.

993
01:18:44,104 --> 01:18:45,105
What's going on here?

994
01:18:45,397 --> 01:18:48,150
They're electrocuting them, morons!
Where's my dog?

995
01:18:49,067 --> 01:18:51,028
Are they electrocuting these dogs?

996
01:18:51,445 --> 01:18:53,906
It's humane, ain't it?
What do you want them to do?

997
01:18:54,239 --> 01:18:55,282
Hit them over the head?

998
01:18:56,658 --> 01:18:59,828
Get off my truck!
Your goddamn dog ain't here!

999
01:19:02,289 --> 01:19:04,958
- What the fuck is going on here?!
- Get the dogs out!

1000
01:19:05,209 --> 01:19:07,169
They're killing them
to make dog food!

1001
01:19:07,461 --> 01:19:08,337
Dogs got to eat too.

1002
01:19:09,713 --> 01:19:10,547
Chico, come here!

1003
01:19:10,839 --> 01:19:12,049
Run, Birdy!

1004
01:19:42,663 --> 01:19:43,455
What is it?

1005
01:19:47,876 --> 01:19:49,127
The cat.

1006
01:20:01,723 --> 01:20:05,477
I'm starting to worry I'll never fly
the way I've been going.

1007
01:20:09,690 --> 01:20:12,151
As scary as a bird's life must be...

1008
01:20:12,442 --> 01:20:14,570
at least they have that.

1009
01:20:14,862 --> 01:20:17,614
They can always fly away.

1010
01:20:46,685 --> 01:20:49,438
Do you know them damn birds
attract mice?

1011
01:20:53,150 --> 01:20:56,069
Mrs. Angelucci said them feathers
can give you asthma.

1012
01:22:16,984 --> 01:22:19,736
Time's running out.
I'm not giving up on you.

1013
01:22:22,281 --> 01:22:25,617
I'm going to get you to talk,
even if I have to punch you out.

1014
01:22:26,034 --> 01:22:28,620
I'm not kidding around.
I can't hold Weiss off.

1015
01:22:28,912 --> 01:22:31,456
I almost told him
about the flying yesterday.

1016
01:22:31,748 --> 01:22:33,834
Goddamn it!
Why can't you listen to me?!

1017
01:22:34,126 --> 01:22:35,502
You want to fly?

1018
01:22:35,752 --> 01:22:38,589
He'll send you air freight
to a cage in a nut house!

1019
01:22:38,881 --> 01:22:40,424
He'll probably send me too!

1020
01:22:40,674 --> 01:22:43,051
We'll have perches, cups,
the whole fucking deal!

1021
01:22:43,343 --> 01:22:45,220
Maybe your mom can dig up
your pigeon suit!

1022
01:22:45,512 --> 01:22:47,639
Weiss can sell you to a sideshow!

1023
01:22:47,931 --> 01:22:51,018
You can double bill
with Zimmy the Fish!

1024
01:22:52,644 --> 01:22:54,188
All right, Birdy.

1025
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:56,773
It's time to start
flapping your wings and peeping.

1026
01:22:57,065 --> 01:22:58,775
I don't believe it, you know.

1027
01:22:59,067 --> 01:23:02,404
If you want to spend your life
as a bird, at least be consistent.

1028
01:23:02,696 --> 01:23:05,073
Look at you.
You don't hop like a bird.

1029
01:23:05,365 --> 01:23:07,242
You don't really sit like one.

1030
01:23:07,534 --> 01:23:10,204
And you sure as hell
can't fly like one.

1031
01:23:10,454 --> 01:23:14,166
If you don't like what I'm saying,
why don't you tell me to shut up?

1032
01:23:14,458 --> 01:23:16,627
You always were hard to hurt, Birdy.

1033
01:23:18,003 --> 01:23:19,379
Real losers never hurt.

1034
01:23:23,008 --> 01:23:25,260
Here you go!
Here comes Hannah to feed you.

1035
01:23:25,552 --> 01:23:27,513
You like that, don't you?

1036
01:23:28,222 --> 01:23:30,557
- What are you doing?
- I'm going to watch you.

1037
01:23:30,849 --> 01:23:33,852
It's fun, watching him be fed.
He's cute when he's fed.

1038
01:23:34,102 --> 01:23:35,312
Stop taunting him.

1039
01:23:35,604 --> 01:23:36,688
He's reacting to me!

1040
01:23:36,980 --> 01:23:39,233
He's giving me that look.
You're pissed!

1041
01:23:39,525 --> 01:23:40,776
Stop it! It isn't working.

1042
01:23:41,068 --> 01:23:42,861
- How do you know?
- It's obvious.

1043
01:23:43,153 --> 01:23:45,030
You fucked it up!
Why did you come in?

1044
01:23:45,489 --> 01:23:47,199
I work here.
He's part of my job.

1045
01:23:47,449 --> 01:23:50,369
Yeah? Well, he's
part of my goddamn life!

1046
01:23:55,374 --> 01:23:56,750
Come on. Look up.

1047
01:23:57,125 --> 01:23:59,545
Look up. Open your eyes.

1048
01:24:44,423 --> 01:24:46,049
Can I talk to you?

1049
01:24:52,973 --> 01:24:54,141
Back there...

1050
01:24:55,642 --> 01:24:57,895
l didn't mean to
make you feel worse.

1051
01:25:01,064 --> 01:25:03,150
I know he means a lot to you.

1052
01:25:08,530 --> 01:25:10,157
It's all right.

1053
01:25:33,931 --> 01:25:34,723
What?

1054
01:25:35,015 --> 01:25:36,475
I'm sorry.

1055
01:25:37,142 --> 01:25:39,645
- I didn't mean to do that to you.
- Don't be.

1056
01:25:39,937 --> 01:25:42,606
I haven't touched
a woman in a long time.

1057
01:25:42,856 --> 01:25:44,983
Al, it's all right.

1058
01:25:45,275 --> 01:25:46,276
Really.

1059
01:25:47,861 --> 01:25:49,321
I got to go.

1060
01:26:35,492 --> 01:26:36,660
Come here.

1061
01:26:38,078 --> 01:26:39,454
What do you want?

1062
01:26:41,915 --> 01:26:43,542
You want to go outside?

1063
01:26:47,504 --> 01:26:49,882
Want to go outside
and play with the other birds?

1064
01:26:55,762 --> 01:26:57,306
You going to give me a kiss?

1065
01:27:01,143 --> 01:27:02,686
In a dream...

1066
01:27:02,978 --> 01:27:05,814
I'm trying to decide what I am.

1067
01:27:06,482 --> 01:27:09,401
When I sleep,
I'm giving myself strength.

1068
01:27:09,651 --> 01:27:12,488
I'm reaching for the force to fly.

1069
01:27:14,323 --> 01:27:15,949
Perta waits...

1070
01:27:16,283 --> 01:27:18,660
cups herself to receive me.

1071
01:27:19,036 --> 01:27:19,995
I hover...

1072
01:27:20,287 --> 01:27:22,831
then lower myself into her.

1073
01:27:23,248 --> 01:27:26,001
Perta and I become one.

1074
01:27:26,418 --> 01:27:28,921
I see through her eyes.

1075
01:27:29,213 --> 01:27:31,089
Fly on her wings.

1076
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:34,927
I am no longer alone.

1077
01:28:17,427 --> 01:28:18,428
It occurs to me...

1078
01:28:19,179 --> 01:28:22,266
that all I did was
put two birds in the aviary.

1079
01:28:22,516 --> 01:28:26,728
Food and water and nothing else,
and now there are four of them.

1080
01:28:27,396 --> 01:28:29,690
I know this is perfectly natural.

1081
01:28:29,982 --> 01:28:32,109
It's one of the things
life is about.

1082
01:28:32,901 --> 01:28:35,237
But to see it happen
in my bedroom...

1083
01:28:35,529 --> 01:28:37,239
under my own eyes...

1084
01:28:37,531 --> 01:28:39,158
is magic.

1085
01:28:41,869 --> 01:28:44,872
All I want to do now
is watch the birds.

1086
01:28:46,707 --> 01:28:51,253
I don't care about the things
that happen in the outside world.

1087
01:28:51,670 --> 01:28:54,047
I feel turned upside down.

1088
01:29:10,814 --> 01:29:14,651
Somehow the babies seem to know
their place is in the air.

1089
01:29:15,027 --> 01:29:16,653
It must be the knowing...

1090
01:29:16,945 --> 01:29:19,198
not the flapping of wings.

1091
01:29:44,056 --> 01:29:45,516
Are you sleeping or what?

1092
01:29:45,766 --> 01:29:48,685
Doris is on the phone.
She wants to talk about the prom.

1093
01:29:50,312 --> 01:29:52,689
Don't give me that look.
I swear to you...

1094
01:29:52,981 --> 01:29:55,234
if you don't go to the prom
like other kids...

1095
01:29:55,526 --> 01:29:57,569
I'm getting rid of these birds!

1096
01:31:24,156 --> 01:31:25,866
- Hi, Dad.
- Hello, son.

1097
01:31:26,158 --> 01:31:28,368
Kind of a mess in here,
with these boys drinking.

1098
01:31:28,660 --> 01:31:30,454
Can't hold their liquor.

1099
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:34,416
I was looking for you.

1100
01:31:34,708 --> 01:31:37,085
I didn't want to embarrass you
with your date.

1101
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:39,630
You wouldn't embarrass me.

1102
01:31:40,172 --> 01:31:44,092
I wanted to give you this,
so you could go someplace afterwards.

1103
01:31:44,384 --> 01:31:46,512
Your girl there is real pretty.

1104
01:31:48,931 --> 01:31:50,724
She's not really my girl.

1105
01:31:51,683 --> 01:31:52,768
Thanks.

1106
01:32:15,958 --> 01:32:18,710
Well, here we are.

1107
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:22,756
I'd like to keep it as a souvenir.

1108
01:32:27,886 --> 01:32:30,722
I know you didn't want to take me.

1109
01:32:32,141 --> 01:32:33,851
You've been very nice about it...

1110
01:32:34,143 --> 01:32:36,895
and now you can have
what you want.

1111
01:32:45,779 --> 01:32:47,156
I'm sorry.

1112
01:32:49,366 --> 01:32:50,534
What?

1113
01:32:51,618 --> 01:32:53,328
I'm not very good at this.

1114
01:32:53,620 --> 01:32:54,913
It's okay.

1115
01:32:55,205 --> 01:32:56,748
It doesn't matter.

1116
01:32:59,418 --> 01:33:01,044
How do they do it?

1117
01:33:02,963 --> 01:33:04,423
I don't know.

1118
01:33:07,843 --> 01:33:09,386
We should go.

1119
01:33:14,850 --> 01:33:17,186
Will I see you again?

1120
01:33:18,937 --> 01:33:20,814
I'll see you in school on Monday.

1121
01:35:37,993 --> 01:35:41,538
The dream is as real to me now
as my waking life.

1122
01:35:42,873 --> 01:35:44,333
I don't know where one begins...

1123
01:35:44,625 --> 01:35:46,418
and the other ends.

1124
01:35:47,419 --> 01:35:49,213
I wish I could tell Al.

1125
01:35:49,838 --> 01:35:51,715
But I'm afraid to.

1126
01:35:53,467 --> 01:35:54,927
In my dreams...

1127
01:35:55,219 --> 01:35:57,513
nothing holds me down.

1128
01:35:57,805 --> 01:36:00,265
Everything is out and away.

1129
01:36:02,726 --> 01:36:06,396
There's nothing in my life
to keep me here anymore.

1130
01:36:07,022 --> 01:36:11,235
I wish I could die
and be born again as a bird.

1131
01:38:43,428 --> 01:38:44,638
Here you go.

1132
01:38:54,690 --> 01:38:56,733
Come on, go ahead.

1133
01:38:57,860 --> 01:38:59,945
I'm sorry about before.

1134
01:39:03,031 --> 01:39:04,658
You got to eat.

1135
01:39:08,704 --> 01:39:10,998
I'll just leave it here for you.

1136
01:39:22,301 --> 01:39:24,303
You got to come back, Birdy.

1137
01:40:07,888 --> 01:40:09,139
Help! Help!

1138
01:40:10,140 --> 01:40:11,683
Medics! Smitty's been hit.

1139
01:40:12,059 --> 01:40:13,602
He's been hit!

1140
01:40:54,852 --> 01:40:55,936
Jesus, Birdy!

1141
01:40:56,228 --> 01:40:58,021
I'm losing it.

1142
01:41:48,030 --> 01:41:50,240
Here comes Santa Claus
Here comes Santa Claus

1143
01:41:50,532 --> 01:41:53,869
Right down Santa Claus Lane
How you doing, Al?

1144
01:41:54,411 --> 01:41:55,704
- What's this?
- I don't know.

1145
01:41:55,996 --> 01:41:58,290
- His mother sent it to you.
- You're kidding!

1146
01:41:58,582 --> 01:41:59,958
No, it couldn't be!

1147
01:42:00,209 --> 01:42:01,251
I don't believe this!

1148
01:42:01,543 --> 01:42:03,879
Okay, I got you now.

1149
01:42:04,296 --> 01:42:06,256
Just wait till you see this.

1150
01:42:06,507 --> 01:42:09,927
Direct from their endless
engagement in South Philadelphia.

1151
01:42:10,219 --> 01:42:13,472
You thought you'd never see them,
but here they are!

1152
01:42:14,431 --> 01:42:15,808
It's the baseballs!

1153
01:42:16,058 --> 01:42:18,477
Your mom sent them.
Can you believe it?

1154
01:42:19,228 --> 01:42:20,854
Come on!
This is it!

1155
01:42:21,104 --> 01:42:22,898
This is your last chance!

1156
01:42:23,148 --> 01:42:25,818
You got to give me
some kind of reaction!

1157
01:42:27,361 --> 01:42:28,529
Come on!

1158
01:42:28,821 --> 01:42:30,531
I need you!

1159
01:42:33,534 --> 01:42:37,454
If Weiss gets a look inside my head,
he's going to lock me up too.

1160
01:42:40,040 --> 01:42:41,667
I'm scared, Birdy.

1161
01:42:41,959 --> 01:42:44,044
I'm more scared now
than I was in the war...

1162
01:42:44,336 --> 01:42:46,797
and I was more scared there
than anybody I knew.

1163
01:42:53,387 --> 01:42:55,472
Talk to me again.

1164
01:42:59,768 --> 01:43:01,562
Hey, Birdy, where are you?

1165
01:43:02,563 --> 01:43:03,730
Oh, no!

1166
01:43:05,065 --> 01:43:06,275
Well, now!

1167
01:43:08,527 --> 01:43:10,487
What happened to you?

1168
01:43:10,779 --> 01:43:14,658
You get so hot with Doris,
you forgot to put your clothes on?

1169
01:43:15,534 --> 01:43:19,037
If your old lady saw you like this,
she'd have a stroke.

1170
01:43:20,372 --> 01:43:22,166
Okay, lover-boy!

1171
01:43:22,458 --> 01:43:25,836
Tell me about Doris,
with plenty of details.

1172
01:43:26,128 --> 01:43:26,962
There's nothing to tell.

1173
01:43:27,254 --> 01:43:29,131
Don't give me this
gentleman-of-honour crap.

1174
01:43:29,423 --> 01:43:32,259
I want to hear about last night.

1175
01:43:32,593 --> 01:43:34,386
I'm not sure I can explain it to you.

1176
01:43:34,678 --> 01:43:36,680
I knew it!
I knew she'd do it.

1177
01:43:36,972 --> 01:43:37,890
Tell me what happened.

1178
01:43:38,807 --> 01:43:40,851
Not with her. With me.

1179
01:43:41,393 --> 01:43:42,686
Last night I flew.

1180
01:43:42,978 --> 01:43:44,605
I know what
it feels like to fly.

1181
01:43:44,855 --> 01:43:46,815
Oh, you flew?
How you flew?

1182
01:43:47,983 --> 01:43:49,526
I'm not sure.

1183
01:43:50,194 --> 01:43:52,738
It's not something you can
really take apart.

1184
01:43:55,240 --> 01:43:57,284
When I fly, it's like in a dream.

1185
01:43:58,035 --> 01:43:59,745
Only it's not a dream.

1186
01:44:01,330 --> 01:44:04,833
You can't put it into words.
You kind of have to feel it.

1187
01:44:06,126 --> 01:44:07,669
You can fly like a bird?

1188
01:44:09,379 --> 01:44:10,672
When I fly...

1189
01:44:11,715 --> 01:44:12,841
l am a bird.

1190
01:44:15,135 --> 01:44:17,638
This is getting too weird.
You got to stop it.

1191
01:44:19,014 --> 01:44:20,974
I thought you would understand.

1192
01:44:21,266 --> 01:44:22,893
Well, I don't.

1193
01:44:23,268 --> 01:44:25,312
- I don't want to hear about it.
- Why?

1194
01:44:25,604 --> 01:44:27,147
Because I'm tired of it!

1195
01:44:29,149 --> 01:44:31,026
We used to have fun together.

1196
01:44:31,276 --> 01:44:32,986
Now you're always off by yourself...

1197
01:44:33,278 --> 01:44:35,948
flying around inside
your goddamn head!

1198
01:44:37,157 --> 01:44:40,869
I hope this dream,
or whatever it is, goes away.

1199
01:44:41,578 --> 01:44:43,622
I think it's bullshit.

1200
01:44:55,843 --> 01:44:57,803
I shouldn't have said that.

1201
01:44:59,012 --> 01:45:01,098
I shouldn't have left you then.

1202
01:45:10,691 --> 01:45:13,193
It's working.
He just needs a little more time.

1203
01:45:14,820 --> 01:45:16,363
I'm not blind.

1204
01:45:16,864 --> 01:45:18,574
I'm sorry the baseballs didn't work.

1205
01:45:18,866 --> 01:45:20,826
There's no sense
in going on with this.

1206
01:45:21,076 --> 01:45:22,870
His condition is deteriorating.

1207
01:45:23,120 --> 01:45:25,080
He hardly moves anymore.
He's stopped eating.

1208
01:45:25,372 --> 01:45:27,166
We'll have to put him on an IV.

1209
01:45:27,416 --> 01:45:30,335
- I could stay and...
- You should be back at Fort Dix.

1210
01:45:30,586 --> 01:45:33,005
There's nothing to keep you
here any longer.

1211
01:45:33,380 --> 01:45:34,756
I just want to say goodbye.

1212
01:45:35,632 --> 01:45:36,800
Go ahead.

1213
01:45:37,259 --> 01:45:38,302
Alone.

1214
01:45:39,595 --> 01:45:41,847
I'll see you in my office afterwards.

1215
01:46:02,784 --> 01:46:04,786
Perta! Come back!

1216
01:50:14,828 --> 01:50:16,121
Don't worry.

1217
01:50:17,539 --> 01:50:19,625
I'm not leaving you again.

1218
01:50:44,358 --> 01:50:45,150
You all right?

1219
01:50:47,319 --> 01:50:49,655
Doctor Weiss asked me
to come and get you.

1220
01:50:50,656 --> 01:50:52,449
I'm not leaving him.

1221
01:50:53,283 --> 01:50:55,869
- They're not going to let you stay.
- Why not?

1222
01:50:56,578 --> 01:50:58,372
Don't you have to go back
to the hospital?

1223
01:50:58,622 --> 01:51:00,249
I'm not going back.

1224
01:51:07,631 --> 01:51:09,424
Come outside and we can talk.

1225
01:51:09,675 --> 01:51:11,301
I don't want to talk.

1226
01:51:11,593 --> 01:51:13,637
That's all I've done
since I've been here.

1227
01:51:13,929 --> 01:51:18,559
Besides, nobody listens to anybody
anyway, even if they aren't crazy.

1228
01:51:18,851 --> 01:51:21,603
You go tell Weiss
I'm staying with my friend.

1229
01:51:22,604 --> 01:51:23,981
Tell him!

1230
01:51:28,902 --> 01:51:31,822
Don't worry, they can't
make me leave you.

1231
01:51:34,283 --> 01:51:36,243
I can't go out there.

1232
01:51:37,327 --> 01:51:39,121
I couldn't make it.

1233
01:51:41,498 --> 01:51:43,709
They got the best of us, Birdy.

1234
01:51:45,669 --> 01:51:48,005
We're both totally screwed up.

1235
01:51:50,215 --> 01:51:55,220
We haven't had anything to do
with making our own lives. Fuck!

1236
01:52:00,100 --> 01:52:02,060
I was always so damned sure...

1237
01:52:02,311 --> 01:52:04,271
about being myself...

1238
01:52:04,771 --> 01:52:08,650
and how nobody was going to
make me do anything I didn't want.

1239
01:52:09,443 --> 01:52:11,320
And now, here I am.

1240
01:52:12,321 --> 01:52:16,241
They finish you off with a discharge
or put you on a casualty list.

1241
01:52:17,701 --> 01:52:20,788
It doesn't matter
how special you are or were.

1242
01:52:22,122 --> 01:52:25,292
I feel like one of those dogs
nobody wanted, remember?

1243
01:52:28,796 --> 01:52:31,882
You know, when that shell
went off in my face...

1244
01:52:34,510 --> 01:52:36,762
l could smell burning flesh.

1245
01:52:37,888 --> 01:52:39,681
And it was crazy...

1246
01:52:41,183 --> 01:52:43,143
because the smell was so sweet...

1247
01:52:43,393 --> 01:52:45,103
so familiar.

1248
01:52:47,773 --> 01:52:51,360
Then I realized that it was
my own skin that was frying.

1249
01:52:54,696 --> 01:52:57,533
And I couldn't even touch the pain.

1250
01:53:00,619 --> 01:53:03,705
I don't even know
what I look like anymore.

1251
01:53:04,540 --> 01:53:06,875
I don't know if it's me
under these bandages...

1252
01:53:07,167 --> 01:53:10,087
or what some Army meat-cutter
thinks is me.

1253
01:53:11,004 --> 01:53:15,634
I don't want a patched-up,
instant-pity excuse for a face.

1254
01:53:17,845 --> 01:53:20,764
I just want it to be AI under here.

1255
01:53:21,098 --> 01:53:24,268
Not some sewn-together freak mask.

1256
01:53:26,103 --> 01:53:27,062
Shit!

1257
01:53:28,272 --> 01:53:31,525
What's so great about
their fucking world anyway?

1258
01:53:32,693 --> 01:53:35,362
We'll just stay here
and keep the hell out of it.

1259
01:53:36,989 --> 01:53:39,658
I don't have to go get
these bandages off.

1260
01:53:42,202 --> 01:53:44,455
I figured out what you're doing.

1261
01:53:45,456 --> 01:53:46,748
You're right.

1262
01:53:48,625 --> 01:53:51,545
We should just hide out
and not talk with anybody.

1263
01:53:53,755 --> 01:53:55,632
And every so often...

1264
01:53:56,383 --> 01:53:58,010
go crazy...

1265
01:53:58,552 --> 01:54:00,596
and run up the wall...

1266
01:54:00,929 --> 01:54:02,181
and spit!

1267
01:54:02,598 --> 01:54:06,143
And throw shit at them,
like the loony across the hall!

1268
01:54:06,894 --> 01:54:09,021
That's what we can do.

1269
01:54:09,480 --> 01:54:11,440
That's what we can do.

1270
01:54:15,027 --> 01:54:17,571
Sometimes you're so full of shit.

1271
01:54:19,072 --> 01:54:20,782
Was that you?

1272
01:54:22,743 --> 01:54:24,119
It was!

1273
01:54:24,411 --> 01:54:27,748
You talked!
It's really you!

1274
01:54:28,415 --> 01:54:30,375
I can't believe it.
Say something else.

1275
01:54:33,921 --> 01:54:36,924
I can't believe it.
It's really you!

1276
01:54:37,591 --> 01:54:39,760
How come you decided to talk?

1277
01:54:40,052 --> 01:54:41,428
I didn't decide.

1278
01:54:41,720 --> 01:54:43,514
It just happened.
I don't know.

1279
01:54:43,764 --> 01:54:45,307
You needed me, didn't you?

1280
01:54:45,599 --> 01:54:47,226
They think we're both crazy.

1281
01:54:47,518 --> 01:54:48,310
What's going on?

1282
01:54:48,602 --> 01:54:51,021
He talked!
Come on, say something.

1283
01:54:52,689 --> 01:54:53,649
Goddamn it, talk!

1284
01:54:53,941 --> 01:54:55,901
- He talked before.
- This won't work.

1285
01:54:56,151 --> 01:54:58,987
I'm telling the truth!
What are you doing, dumbshit?

1286
01:54:59,738 --> 01:55:01,990
Don't you know
they'll keep you forever?!

1287
01:55:02,282 --> 01:55:03,992
Goddamn it, talk!

1288
01:55:04,284 --> 01:55:06,662
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!
Birdy, talk!

1289
01:55:06,954 --> 01:55:09,248
- Come on, let's go.
- No! Goddamn it!

1290
01:55:09,540 --> 01:55:11,500
I'm staying here with him!

1291
01:55:12,626 --> 01:55:15,295
This isn't a game anymore.
Why wouldn't you talk?

1292
01:55:16,004 --> 01:55:17,714
I didn't have anything to say to him.

1293
01:55:18,006 --> 01:55:19,967
What are you, crazy?

1294
01:55:21,218 --> 01:55:23,220
We have to get out of here.

1295
01:55:34,356 --> 01:55:35,440
Come on!

1296
01:56:28,076 --> 01:56:29,620
Birdy, don't!

1297
01:56:43,550 --> 01:56:44,426
What?
