Hotlanta, home of the Hawks,
the Atlanta Stomp,

2
00:00:17,117 --> 00:00:19,585
and that fine-ass Michael Vick!

3
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:23,713
Michael. If you out there listenin'.
Come on over to WJLM

4
00:00:23,823 --> 00:00:26,291
and touch down
on a sister's backside

5
00:00:26,393 --> 00:00:30,454
Your girl Helen's got an end zone
you wouldn't believe baby!

6
00:00:30,563 --> 00:00:31,996
Holler at your girl!

7
00:00:33,566 --> 00:00:36,000
Call me anytime

8
00:00:36,102 --> 00:00:40,232
Call me if you need
someone to talk to

9
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:44,470
Call me,
satisfaction guaranteed

10
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:48,943
- Darnelle, you see my blue sweater?
- Leave me alone.

11
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,643
Darnelle, I know
you be dippin' in my closet

12
00:00:51,751 --> 00:00:53,548
and I'm not going anywhere until...

13
00:00:54,687 --> 00:00:57,520
- Leave me alone.
- You missed.

14
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:02,854
Hey, Nana.

15
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:06,159
Look at you!

16
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:09,394
- Come on, sit down, baby.
- No, thanks. I'm late.

17
00:01:09,502 --> 00:01:11,129
Nana, have you seen
my blue sweater?

18
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:12,499
I ain't seen it.

19
00:01:12,605 --> 00:01:15,130
- Go ask your mama.
- Mama!

20
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:17,106
Stop screaming.
I'm back here.

21
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:20,611
Satisfaction guaranteed

22
00:01:20,713 --> 00:01:21,975
You almost ready, baby girl?
We gotta go.

23
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,549
I can't find my blue sweater.

24
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:25,675
That's because it's in the truck
where you left it,

25
00:01:25,785 --> 00:01:27,582
where you
pretty much leave everything.

26
00:01:27,687 --> 00:01:29,314
Okay, I guess I'm ready.

27
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:31,447
You ain't strollin' up in school
with that pimp hat on.

28
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:36,154
Mom, it's not a pimp hat, it's fashion.
Alicia Keys has the same one.

29
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:38,127
Well, good for her.
Lose the hat.

30
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:39,789
Why send me
to a performing arts school

31
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:43,335
if you're not gonna allow me
to be creative or express myself?

32
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:45,597
Sounds
like a contradiction to me.

33
00:01:45,705 --> 00:01:47,696
"Sounds
like a contradiction to me."

34
00:01:47,807 --> 00:01:51,573
Lose the hat and the attitude.
I'll meet you in the car. Go ahead.

35
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:56,649
- Vanessa!
- Yeah?

36
00:01:56,749 --> 00:01:59,411
Do you think these pants
make my butt look big?

37
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:02,147
- Yeah, they do.
- Perfect.

38
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:07,526
Call me if you need
someone to talk to

39
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:10,562
I'm gonna get the hell out of here.
I'll mess with it at the shop.

40
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:25,676
- I see my blue sweater.
- Yep.

41
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:44,128
Hi!

42
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:47,928
Told you.

43
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:50,130
Go ahead, get out.

44
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:53,167
Wait.
Fly me some fingers.

45
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:57,803
- All right, have a good day. Love you.
- Love you, too.

46
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:03,013
Can't believe it.
She was right.

47
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:07,617
Hollering with Helen
in the morning

48
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,551
Hotlanta, how y'all is?

49
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:11,783
Hope y'all feeling somethin' like me

50
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:14,485
reckon y'all checkin'
my good mood this mornin'.

51
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:17,995
'cause your girl Helen
is doin' quite well. Thank you very much

52
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:21,464
See. one of my many mens-es
came through last night

53
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:24,264
and got crunk with my trunk.
If you know what I'm sayin'

54
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,837
Yeah. He got a sister smilin'

55
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:28,499
like she just got
a thousand-dollar credit increase

56
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:31,873
on her gas card
and ready to get pumped!

57
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:37,611
Y'all know I ain't lyin' to you
Just keepin' it real. For real. For real

58
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:41,447
Holler at your girl Helen
I'll holler

59
00:03:41,854 --> 00:03:43,651
Don't even worry about it.
I'll get the hair.

60
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:45,849
You just come on in and we...
Yeah, we'll see you at 10:00.

61
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,256
All right, bye-bye.

62
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:54,061
No, no, I can't go.
I have my consultation later.

63
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:56,730
Finally getting those implants.

64
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:58,938
Dr. Kopelin says it'll take
like a week or so to recover,

65
00:03:58,938 --> 00:04:00,462
Dr. Kopelin says it'll take
like a week or so to recover,

66
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:04,270
but I'll be so doped up
on Vicodin, who cares?

67
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:06,470
Okay, I'll talk to you later.

68
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:11,783
Joanne, Joanne, girl,
I'm telling you, don't do it.

69
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:14,284
Or you know what? You'll be going
hot and heavy with your boyfriend,

70
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:16,855
he squeeze too hard,
that thing fly right out your mouth.

71
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:19,985
Besides, you don't need that, girl.
Do you know why?

72
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:23,494
- Why?
- Because you are beautiful.

73
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:27,965
- Oh, my God, Gina! It's amazing.
- Well, you know.

74
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:30,627
You just have to give me a bottle
of that special conditioner you make.

75
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:32,534
Hey, you gotta keep that on the low,

76
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,403
because Jorge only likes us
using Jorge products.

77
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:36,566
Oh, forget about Jorge.

78
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:39,406
I swear, you're the best thing
that ever happened to him.

79
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:44,279
Is she now? I thought the best thing
to ever happen to Jorge's was Jorge.

80
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:48,115
My God, Joanne, you look fantastic.
You look incredible.

81
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:50,788
So, when you getting the implants?

82
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,824
Soon.

83
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:55,052
Jorge, you have a gem
on your hands.

84
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:59,427
- Gina is a miracle worker.
- Yeah. She's a... worker.

85
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,768
Sweetie, I gotta run.

86
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:07,362
I got some crow's feet screaming
for some Botox, so next week?

87
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:08,735
I'll be here.

88
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:13,872
Great to see you, baby.

89
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:16,806
So, Gina, nice work.

90
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:19,441
Thanks. Just doing what I do.

91
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:23,318
Well, about that, just remember
that in doing what you do,

92
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:25,891
you're actually doing what I do,
what Jorge does,

93
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,857
the person whose name
is on the moniker, ja?

94
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,489
"My nigga"? What?

95
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:36,265
"Moniker."
As in the name on the building.

96
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:40,103
So, that being said,
you just have a marvelous day, ja?

97
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:43,671
You need to learn
how to pronounce that correctly.

98
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:46,241
Jorge's time of the month again?

99
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,143
Let's go get some lunch.

100
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:51,915
I could use some air, anyway.

101
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:54,509
You got a dictionary?
I gotta look up this word: "ma-nigga."

102
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,110
- "Moniker"?
- "Ma-nigga."

103
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:58,417
- "Ma-nigger"?
- That's what I thought he said.

104
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,321
- You said, "My nigga"?
- "My nigger"?

105
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:01,586
- Don't you ever say that again.
- What?

106
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,252
You know, you whites,
you can't really say that word,

107
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,388
but that's what I thought Jorge said!

108
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:08,365
The guy can do some hair.
Well, he can work a flip.

109
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:11,733
- But he's a idiot to work for.
- At least you got a chair.

110
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:15,035
- I'm stuck in shampoo hell.
- Girl, you'll get out.

111
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:17,666
Oh, dear God, let it be soon!

112
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:19,836
I've been dying
to show you something.

113
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:22,710
Pictures from a hair show
I worked last weekend.

114
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:25,109
Those are my models.

115
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,379
What?

116
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:31,312
You did this?

117
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:36,452
Girl, this is good.
Jorge is trippin' not giving you a chair.

118
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:39,895
Well, if it means anything to you,
you always got a chair in my shop.

119
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:42,627
- Why, thank you.
- Well, when I get a shop.

120
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:46,368
What do you want a shop for?
Too much of a headache.

121
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:49,930
I always wanted my own shop.
Shoot, sell my own products.

122
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,970
Vanessa getting accepted
into that expensive-ass music school

123
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,776
just moved it
from Chicago to here.

124
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:59,078
- But it'll happen.
- Yes, it will.

125
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:03,315
Until then, I'm just gonna kick back,
stack my chips at Jorge's...

126
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,448
And try not to kill him.

127
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:30,143
- She can play, can't she?
- Yeah, just like her daddy.

128
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,642
Rest his soul.

129
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:37,522
She don't have the same passion
for it since he died, though.

130
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:40,182
But still, all I got to do
is hear her play

131
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:43,023
to know why I put up
with Jorge's nonsense.

132
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,063
I want my daughter
to have the best, you know?

133
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:47,564
Hell, at this point,
all I want from my daughter

134
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:50,761
is some common sense
and some clothes that fit.

135
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,997
Gina, the girl put on a pair of pants

136
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:55,665
that came down
to the top of her burning bush.

137
00:07:56,642 --> 00:08:00,339
Sometimes that girl
make me mad enough to chew bricks.

138
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:02,641
Don't mess
your dental work up over it.

139
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:06,013
- I don't know.
- She gonna be all right.

140
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,925
You look absolutely fantastic.

141
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:24,366
We going to make another appointment,
touch up the roots, ja?

142
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:27,030
- Ja Thank you, Jorge.
- Great to see you.

143
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,577
Don't be afraid to hop on top.

144
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:42,120
Listen, a man like a lady in the streets
and a freak in the bedroom.

145
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:44,655
You know, you got,
what, seven kids? I'm telling you...

146
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,289
Terri is here.
I must go to Pilates.

147
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:49,691
Please make sure
that she's taken care of, ja?

148
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:51,660
Okay, soon as I square away
Mrs. Dexter.

149
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:52,731
Pronto, Gina.

150
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:56,193
Fine, Jorge. Right away.

151
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:03,533
You might want to find a frame
for your memories.

152
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:05,668
Preferably not one from K-Mart.

153
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:08,942
Jorge's was not named
Best Designed Salon in Atlanta

154
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,448
for having Scottish tape
on some mirrors, right? Ja?

155
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,143
Okay, I go now.

156
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:20,223
Hey, Terri. How you doin'?
Come on, get comfortable.

157
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:28,898
I'm having this major party
for Steven and a few of his clients.

158
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:32,129
And I just have to look remarkable.
I just have to.

159
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,433
So I was hoping that, you know,

160
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,269
you would do a little
of your magic on me.

161
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,570
I think I can conjure up
somethin' for you.

162
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:41,772
You know what?
Lynn, I got this.

163
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:44,509
Why don't you go finish
setting Mrs. Dexter for me?

164
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:49,679
I don't know. I was just supposed
to shampoo till an available chair opens.

165
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:51,723
Well, do you see me at my chair?

166
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:52,813
No.

167
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:56,019
Then it's open.
Go ahead, girl, do your thing.

168
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,292
Come on back.

169
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:03,829
- So tell me about this dinner party.
- Big, big party.

170
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:06,029
But, don't worry,
I've got everything under control.

171
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:10,541
I have caterers,
the kids all have play dates...

172
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:12,076
- Well, that's good to hear.
- Life is good.

173
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:13,941
You know,
life is just really, really good.

174
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:15,843
You havin' problems with Steven again?

175
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:18,746
Yeah, I am.

176
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:22,719
He just looks at me
like he hates me.

177
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:24,016
- He does.
- Come on, now.

178
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,091
He doesn't hate you.
Don't even worry about it.

179
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:29,320
I got my special conditioner
to take care of that, so...

180
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:31,555
You know, I just don't know what to do.
I try to please him.

181
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:33,723
I do everything.
I've bought sex toys.

182
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,061
Did you get any
of them Chinese balls?

183
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:37,431
- Do you think that'll work?
- Oh, man.

184
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:39,231
That's the move right there.

185
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:42,034
I mean, I hear
they make men go crazy.

186
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:44,632
You just sneak 'em up in there
and then go...

187
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:47,872
I don't know about that!

188
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:54,151
...out.
- Shampooer.

189
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:57,980
I guess.

190
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:01,389
So don't forget you gotta drink
a lot of water, take those vitamins,

191
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,654
and come on back next week.

192
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:04,195
Let me give you
another treatment, okay?

193
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:06,423
Thank you, Gina.
Your cream has just saved my hair.

194
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:07,499
- Oh, Terri, come on.
- Thank you.

195
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,931
Take care now. Have fun!

196
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:10,969
- You're so sweet!
- Don't stress!

197
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:14,062
Hello, shampooing girl.
Have you gone cuckoo clock in the head?

198
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:16,607
I don't remember saying
you could leave the shampooing area.

199
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:19,678
You are the shampooing girl.
You should be shampooing, no?

200
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:23,340
Lynn! Girl, you got
some skills on you!

201
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:24,939
Look at this. This is great!

202
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:32,557
- I hope I didn't get her in trouble.
- I hope not.

203
00:11:32,658 --> 00:11:35,957
So, this is not the way
we do things here at Jorge's, ja?

204
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:38,223
Look, I know
it wasn't proper protocol,

205
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:41,060
but you were gone,
and I was busy and Lynn...

206
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:45,232
Look, Lynn has her license.
So I just told her to take a shot.

207
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:48,238
So you told her to take a shot.

208
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,706
Yeah.
And she dunked it.

209
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,645
I don't care
if she dunked it, alley-ooped it,

210
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:57,045
touch-downed it, or any
of your other little street colloquialisms.

211
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:59,879
You don't get to give shots
here at Jorge's, okay?

212
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:03,284
I give the shots...
unless you're diabetic.

213
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:07,086
Right? The stylists here, they work
for me, they don't work for you.

214
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:09,093
So if you wish
to continue working here,

215
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:11,129
I suggest that you
get with the program

216
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,925
and you give me
some proper respect, ja?

217
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:15,967
I showed you the proper respect
when I took care of your client

218
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:18,059
while you took a Pilates class.

219
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:19,831
So you wish to altercate with me?

220
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:22,806
You have no idea
what I wish to do with you.

221
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,603
You know, you act
like you own me or something.

222
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:27,577
Gina, Gina, of course I do.

223
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:30,547
Without me, you would be
back in Chicago, baby,

224
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:32,617
washing hair
in your mama's kitchen.

225
00:12:32,718 --> 00:12:34,208
Now you wanna talk
about my mama?

226
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,345
So do I own you?

227
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:38,855
Technically,
as in "have papers on you"? No.

228
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,391
Get your fingers out my face.

229
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:43,621
I've given you the lifestyle
that you have grown accustomed to.

230
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:45,196
Get your fingers out my face.

231
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:49,791
And, like all things, what Jorge giveth,
Jorge can also taketh away.

232
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:52,700
You know what, Jorge?
I don't need a damn thing from you.

233
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:53,863
You hear me?

234
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:56,635
And you cannot "taketh"
anything away from me.

235
00:12:56,742 --> 00:13:00,178
You know, matter of fact,
I giveth it back. I quit.

236
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,304
- Oh, you quit?
- Yeah. I don't need this.

237
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:04,575
Shoot. I quit.

238
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,117
Outta here.
Snatch my picture off the wall.

239
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:11,712
Everybody knows I am the shit
all up and through Jorge's.

240
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:13,689
And what's up
with the K-Mart thing, huh?

241
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,055
Is it 'cause I'm black?

242
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:18,028
Is it 'cause I'm black?
'Cause I'm black?!

243
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:21,566
Let me tell you something, baby.
You're nothing without me.

244
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:24,158
You're going to fall flat on your ass,
I promise you that.

245
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,362
Well, I got a little cushion.

246
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,666
You wanna kiss it?
I didn't think so!

247
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:52,125
- What you doin' up?
- Can't sleep.

248
00:13:58,204 --> 00:13:59,728
I miss him.

249
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:04,435
- So do I.
- Wait a minute.

250
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:07,307
Does this mean I'm gonna have
to leave music school now?

251
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:09,278
No. Why would you
say that, Vanessa?

252
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:12,350
Because, Mom... you got fired.

253
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:15,716
No. I quit.
There's a difference.

254
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:19,154
Please. If I wanted to go get
a job tomorrow at a shop, I could.

255
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:23,354
But that's not where my heart is.
It's time I owned somethin'.

256
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:35,629
I can't approve this,
not for this much.

257
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:38,574
But didn't you read my business plan
or my letters of recommendation?

258
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:41,544
All very impressive, but...

259
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:47,040
But...

260
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:51,179
Miss Norris, see, you're
missing what we like to call here

261
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:54,555
at Southern Mutual
and Savings "the three C's."

262
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,457
- Credit, collateral...
- Color.

263
00:14:57,196 --> 00:14:58,493
No. I was gonna say capital,

264
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:00,565
which is something
that you could earn

265
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:03,226
by acquiring
one of our secured credit cards,

266
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:06,668
as opposed to you
throwing around your... race one.

267
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:13,740
And that's my lunch calling me,
but nature's calling me first.

268
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:16,474
So, Miss Norris,
good day to you.

269
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:44,208
Don't kill me.

270
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:50,309
Stay still, now, or I'ma mess around
and take your eye out.

271
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:51,508
Relax, woman.

272
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:54,746
There. Okay, okay.

273
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:56,377
Let me get a look at you.
All right.

274
00:15:56,488 --> 00:15:59,013
There.
A new face at the bank.

275
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,986
- You like it?
- Oh, you...

276
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:07,930
I guess that's a "yes,"
or is that the way you fight?

277
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:10,661
No. I like it. I love it.

278
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,238
I haven't seen this woman in years.

279
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:18,333
Well, now you got her back.
Try not to lose her.

280
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:22,479
All right, go get
that cutie bank manager now.

281
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:25,742
Loan approved.

282
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:27,678
What?

283
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,087
You got your loan.

284
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:32,885
I got it? Oh, yes!

285
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,892
Go Gina,
it's your birthday

286
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,428
I got a hundred-fifty thou',
a hundred-fifty thou'

287
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:38,518
- No, Gina, no, no.
- A hundred-fifty...

288
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:41,098
No, I... No, we...
Not quite that much.

289
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,792
That's cool.

290
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:44,163
I'll take a hundred thousand!

291
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:48,103
- No, no, Gina.
- What? What? No?

292
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:51,040
What? Like 95? 85?

293
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:54,579
- I can work with sev... Lower than that?
- Thirty.

294
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:59,014
Thirty thousand dollars?
What kind of shop can I buy with that?

295
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:04,750
Lord Jesus, have mercy!

296
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:08,088
Look like somebody swallowed
the '70s and threw it up in here.

297
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:11,356
Now, Gina, I've been
in some messed up salons, but damn!

298
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:14,626
Girl, this is just straight-up nasty!

299
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:17,565
Thanks, Darnelle.
Tell me how you really feel.

300
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:24,599
What's that supposed to be?

301
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:29,872
Looks like some kind of skylight.

302
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:33,379
Mama, that look like a big ol' hole
in the ceilin' to me.

303
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:36,113
I got an electrician
coming to look at that tomorrow.

304
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:40,749
Listen to that.
Whoever's up there can play.

305
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:42,292
And they need to stop.

306
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:45,989
The realtor told me I'd be inheriting
a few stylists, not a whole damn band.

307
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:48,999
Well, Gina, let's just look
at the blessing in it.

308
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:51,695
You've got your own beauty shop!

309
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:54,500
Be happy. It's yours!

310
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:56,540
Come on,
let's make this place sparkle!

311
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:58,701
I'm ready!
Let's turn this into Gina's!

312
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:00,472
Turn that music on!

313
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:05,000
There we go...
Madam C.J.

314
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:10,340
Hi, can I help you?

315
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:13,714
Yes, ma'am.
I received a message yesterday.

316
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:16,549
Joe's Electrical Repairs.
I'm Joe.

317
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:20,456
I found your business card
on Miss Angeline's desk,

318
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,550
and I was guessing
you had done some work here before?

319
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:26,392
A little. Miss Angeline
wasn't exactly into repair and upkeep.

320
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:29,490
- Who you telling?
- Well, it looks nice.

321
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:31,091
- You've done a great job with it.
- Thank you.

322
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:32,500
And you are?

323
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:34,663
I'm Gina. Sorry.

324
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:38,334
And this is my mother-in-law,
that's Paulette and her daughter Darnelle.

325
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:41,412
- And that's my baby, Vanessa.
- Ladies.

326
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:47,875
So, you're familiar with the place.
How bad is it?

327
00:19:49,154 --> 00:19:50,849
The place needs a lot of work.

328
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:55,086
Rotting wires, outdated sockets...

329
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:59,297
And the main breaker
keeps getting tripped.

330
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:02,697
- Is that a problem?
- Not if you like standing in the dark.

331
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:06,698
A lot just needs to be done.
A total upgrade.

332
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:10,536
Well, right now, I just need you
to take care of this one thing for me.

333
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:14,912
Now, you see
this big ol' hole in the ceilin'?

334
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:16,139
That just ain't workin' for me.

335
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:19,149
Neither's the piano playing coming
out of it, if you know what I'm saying,

336
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:21,048
so I just need you to take those wires

337
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:24,589
and sort of stuff 'em back up in there
so I can patch up the ceiling.

338
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:25,724
Can you do that for me?

339
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:26,053
Can you do that for me?

340
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:29,650
I could, but that's not going
to solve your dilemma.

341
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:32,995
So, let's say I do
the whole upgrade thingamajig.

342
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:34,463
How much is that gonna cost me?

343
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,828
I'd say between 4,000 to 6,000.

344
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:42,335
Well, don't let the doorknob
hit you on the way out.

345
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:46,643
Okay, then... Good luck.

346
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:50,406
Wait, wait.
Come on, what about the ceilin'?

347
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:51,607
Don't look at it.

348
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:55,281
I guess I'm supposed to ignore
the piano playin' comin' through it?

349
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:57,287
I'll try to play more quietly.

350
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:04,585
I play piano, too.

351
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:06,186
Is that right, mademoiselle?

352
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:08,789
Yeah. Maybe I can come up
and play some time?

353
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:14,964
Maybe. We'll see, little one.

354
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:20,402
- Ladies, ciao.
- Bye.

355
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:29,312
Mama, I like him.

356
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:33,287
And I like you
with this broom in your hand.

357
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:39,120
Gina, it's looking beautiful.

358
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:42,029
You think the ladies will like it
when they come in tomorrow?

359
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,364
Please, compared
to what they were workin' with

360
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:46,903
before we got here,
they should love it.

361
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:49,507
So, what don't you like
about the place?

362
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:51,803
I ain't sayin' I don't like it.

363
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:56,370
I just say, you know, I don't think
it's all o' that. That's all.

364
00:21:56,481 --> 00:22:00,474
For real. It's gonna take more
than a new little paint job

365
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:02,018
and some posters to impress me.

366
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,953
This coming from a woman
who had Popeye's cater her wedding.

367
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:06,991
Church's.
It was Church's, Josephine.

368
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:09,652
- It was chicken.
- I ain't mad at you.

369
00:22:09,761 --> 00:22:12,127
I had Gladys Knight
Chicken and Waffles cater mine.

370
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:13,720
I still got waffles in the freezer.

371
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,595
Would y'all let the woman
who own the shop talk?

372
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:16,827
Go on, Gina.

373
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:17,902
Thank you, Miss Josephine.

374
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:20,665
Say what you got to say.
It's your shop, sister.

375
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:22,364
All right, now,
what I was trying to say wa...

376
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:24,305
They ain't gonna listen, no way.

377
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:26,835
Talk to us, go on.

378
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:28,604
Go on.

379
00:22:31,883 --> 00:22:33,851
What I was tryin' to say was, no...

380
00:22:33,952 --> 00:22:35,044
What about the booth rent?

381
00:22:35,153 --> 00:22:37,087
I hope you don't plan on raisin' it.

382
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:38,918
Can't be coming outta pocket, Gina.

383
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:41,356
I can't come outta pocket.

384
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:44,952
M.J. Got basketball camp,
baby A-Rod need a new stroller,

385
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:47,088
and little Shaq, he need braces.

386
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:50,427
Dang, girl. You got you
a little Dream Team over there, huh?

387
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:55,268
And look, Auntie Gina, this one here
is Venus Serena Marion Jones, Junior.

388
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:58,468
Right, that's Auntie Gina's baby.

389
00:22:59,611 --> 00:23:03,809
So, look, as of right now,
no, I'm not gonna raise the booth rent,

390
00:23:03,915 --> 00:23:06,315
but I will be making
some changes around here.

391
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:10,252
Look, I'm trying to create an environment
where you can come and relax.

392
00:23:10,355 --> 00:23:12,915
All right? We are professionals.
Professionals.

393
00:23:13,024 --> 00:23:15,492
And you never know, Oprah
might come strollin' up in here one day.

394
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:19,655
Yeah, you know, if she mistook the place
for, what, a Krispy Kreme joint?

395
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:23,434
You need to hush, little sister.
You ain't got a pot to piss in.

396
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:25,799
Oprah pot platinum, baby.

397
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:29,840
You know that poem Maya Angelou wrote?
"Phenomenal Woman"?

398
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:34,242
"Pretty woman,
wonder where my secret lies?

399
00:23:34,346 --> 00:23:38,749
I ain't cute or built to fit
a fashion-model size."

400
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:40,977
She's talking about Oprah, hon!

401
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:45,920
Yes, she was! And just like Oprah,
I wanna be the best.

402
00:23:46,024 --> 00:23:49,255
And in order to be the best,
we got to change the game a little bit.

403
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:52,057
Which brings me to this...
please, no more food on the counters.

404
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:54,098
Let's try to keep it
as clean as we can.

405
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:56,224
You know what?
I make you this promise.

406
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:58,666
I ain't gonna get
no food on your stuff.

407
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,032
Don't sit...

408
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:03,537
That's a little syrup
spilled on the seat.

409
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:04,609
That's a white couch.

410
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:06,336
But it look like Louis Vuitton.

411
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:08,276
They ain't gonna know.

412
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,438
- High fashion.
- Turn it over.

413
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:11,140
- You can Shout it out.
- Shout it out.

414
00:24:11,249 --> 00:24:13,149
- Pull it out and throw it in the dryer.
- What's up?

415
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:15,310
Yo, look,
we gotta work as a team.

416
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:19,356
In order to work as a team,
we have to look like a team.

417
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:22,552
New smocks, one size fits all.
Porsche, Mercedes.

418
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:24,356
- What?
- Okay?

419
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:27,796
They ain't had none
of these with some Kente cloth

420
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:31,835
or somethin' more with a little
Motherland flavor, a cheetah print?

421
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:35,065
This ain't got no breast flap.
I mean, how am I supposed to...

422
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:38,665
If I... Maybe right here.
Maybe it'll slip through the hole.

423
00:24:41,346 --> 00:24:42,313
Am I late?

424
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:43,381
Hey! No, no, no.

425
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:45,143
You right on time, girl.
Come on in.

426
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,241
Everybody, this is Lynn.

427
00:24:47,352 --> 00:24:50,981
Lynn is one of the baddest hair stylists
to ever set foot out of Augusta...

428
00:24:51,089 --> 00:24:52,056
Blue Ridge.

429
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:53,590
Blue Ridge, Georgia.

430
00:24:53,692 --> 00:24:56,092
She got mad skills.
The girl is talented.

431
00:24:56,194 --> 00:24:58,094
And she gonna be working
here in the shop with us.

432
00:24:58,196 --> 00:25:00,221
Working here. As what?

433
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:02,858
As a stylist.

434
00:25:02,968 --> 00:25:04,560
Hell, no!

435
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:06,432
Hell, no!

436
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:09,507
Come on.
Okay, you know what?

437
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:12,509
I'm sorry, but you doing
a little too much around here, okay?

438
00:25:12,611 --> 00:25:15,478
I mean, you ain't tryin'
to, what, brighten up the place.

439
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,741
You's tryin' to whiten up the place.

440
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:19,009
For real.

441
00:25:19,117 --> 00:25:21,278
So, here's what I'ma do, Gina.

442
00:25:21,386 --> 00:25:25,982
I'ma let you and little Miss Blue Ridge,
here, you know, have the shop.

443
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:29,618
Do your thang.
Go on, girl! Do your thang.

444
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:34,165
'Cause I can't be a part of this, okay?
Porsche, are you rollin'?

445
00:25:36,067 --> 00:25:38,433
Yeah. I ain't gonna be able
to do it, either.

446
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:41,904
- I didn't mean to run 'em out.
- No, no, don't even worry about it.

447
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:44,407
Better we get rid
of the bad apples now.

448
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:46,500
Besides, them girls
got too much attitude.

449
00:25:46,611 --> 00:25:49,079
I 'bout to slap the shit
out of one o' they asses.

450
00:25:49,948 --> 00:25:53,440
A'ight, anybody else leavin'?
'Cause this white bitch here is stayin'.

451
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:55,745
Chanel.

452
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:58,448
You know, no white girl
is gonna mess up me and my money.

453
00:25:58,557 --> 00:25:59,649
Y'all can go.

454
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:03,250
- Whatever.
- A'ight... whatever.

455
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:07,422
All right. Y'all, you wanna fly
outta here with them birds?

456
00:26:07,532 --> 00:26:10,501
'Cause I got a business to run.
I need to know something.

457
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:16,107
That's what I'm talking about.
All right.

458
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:26,107
Gina's Beauty Shop.

459
00:26:28,386 --> 00:26:31,219
No problem.
Thank you. Bye-bye.

460
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:35,490
- Excuse me.
- May I offer you a cappuccino?

461
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:38,222
I don't want
no damn cappa-whatever-it-is.

462
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:40,025
Where's Angeline at?

463
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,528
I'm sorry.
She's no longer here.

464
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:46,764
- She die?
- No, no, no, she didn't die.

465
00:26:46,871 --> 00:26:48,532
Then where is she?
'Cause I got an appointment.

466
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,609
Well, my name is Gina.
I bought the shop from Miss Angeline.

467
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:54,508
I can have one of my other operators
assist you, if you like, Miss...

468
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:56,376
Mrs. Towner.

469
00:26:56,481 --> 00:26:57,448
Mrs. Towner.

470
00:26:57,549 --> 00:27:00,450
"T" as in "Tom,"
"O" as in "Othavee,"

471
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:04,420
"W" as in "Willacoochee, Georgia."

472
00:27:04,522 --> 00:27:06,387
- Willacoochee.
- And "ner" as in...

473
00:27:06,491 --> 00:27:08,516
"I don't live 'ner' here."

474
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:11,061
Well, don't let me
keep you waiting any longer.

475
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:14,393
Come on, now. Would you like
some water or something, Mrs. Towner?

476
00:27:14,499 --> 00:27:15,761
Yes, please. Thank you.

477
00:27:15,867 --> 00:27:18,802
Lynn, would you take care
of Mrs. Towner, please?

478
00:27:18,903 --> 00:27:22,066
Of course.
Hi, Mrs. Towner.

479
00:27:22,874 --> 00:27:25,672
When'd you all get to be
so integrated 'round here?

480
00:27:25,777 --> 00:27:29,213
This morning.
What can I do for you today?

481
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:32,806
Don't give me no 'fro.
Just keep my curls neat and tight.

482
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:34,908
And then maybe
you can pin it up for me.

483
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,044
Not a problem.

484
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:38,714
Girl, what you know
'bout doin' black folks' hair?

485
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:41,087
I'm not gonna screw it up,
if that's what you mean.

486
00:27:41,192 --> 00:27:42,386
Good for you.

487
00:27:43,061 --> 00:27:45,529
Here's your water, Miss Towner... Mrs.

488
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:46,756
Well, thank you, sweetie.

489
00:27:58,376 --> 00:28:01,573
...and I'm tellin' him to move back
just a little bit, you know what I mean?

490
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,409
But he wouldn't even move back.

491
00:28:05,917 --> 00:28:08,784
Well, either I'm still buzzin'
from last night's party,

492
00:28:08,887 --> 00:28:10,115
or Miss Angeline done come up.

493
00:28:10,221 --> 00:28:13,418
For real, though, from backwood
to Hollywood. This is nice.

494
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,993
Ladies, hi. I'm Gina.
I'm the new owner.

495
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:17,459
Can I offer you some cappuccinos?

496
00:28:17,562 --> 00:28:19,291
- Or water? Some coffee?
- Don't mind if I do.

497
00:28:19,397 --> 00:28:22,230
- I like you already, Miss Gina.
- Me, too.

498
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:26,360
Damn! Look at you
with that big ol' rock on your finger!

499
00:28:26,471 --> 00:28:28,302
You ought to be careful
rollin' with that.

500
00:28:28,406 --> 00:28:31,569
Just a little six-karat keepsake
my husband bought me.

501
00:28:31,676 --> 00:28:35,271
Christopher Clark...
power forward... Atlanta Hawks?

502
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,940
"Three-point Chris"?
That's your husband?

503
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:40,244
Oh, my God, girl, he got game.

504
00:28:40,351 --> 00:28:41,443
Yes, he does.

505
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:43,922
Anywho, I have an appointment
with Mercedes today.

506
00:28:43,922 --> 00:28:44,616
Anywho, I have an appointment
with Mercedes today.

507
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:48,790
She no longer works here.

508
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:51,589
Well, we'll take Porsche today, then.

509
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:54,120
She gone, too.

510
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:56,700
Actually, we got rid
of all of our foreign cars.

511
00:28:57,869 --> 00:29:00,360
Well, damn!
I couldn't get a heads-up or something?

512
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:02,667
You know, we should
just go on over to Aspire, girl,

513
00:29:02,774 --> 00:29:04,503
and get in where we fit in,
'cause obviously this...

514
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:07,737
Well, you could do that or...
you could let me do your hair.

515
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:11,441
I know how you like to roll.
You like to keep it tight. I can tell.

516
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:13,073
You don't play about your look.

517
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:16,676
And let me tell you somethin', I will have
you lookin' fly as a mug courtside.

518
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:19,484
Did I tell you my name was Gina?
I don't play about my edges.

519
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,183
I will lay that hair down.

520
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:23,954
I'll have it shining
up on that big ol' Jumbotron,

521
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:26,292
that big monitor TV
that be in the arena.

522
00:29:26,397 --> 00:29:27,523
Yeah, that's right.

523
00:29:27,632 --> 00:29:30,294
You gonna have to just stop
and take a look at yourself,

524
00:29:30,401 --> 00:29:32,301
because everybody else
gonna be looking at you.

525
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:36,334
I'm so sorry,
but I don't really know you.

526
00:29:38,643 --> 00:29:39,974
I'll do it for free.

527
00:29:40,078 --> 00:29:41,773
So where should I sit?

528
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,279
No, I can't do highlights.

529
00:29:43,381 --> 00:29:47,477
My client has an important game tonight,
and I'm trying to go with the P-I-M-P look.

530
00:29:47,585 --> 00:29:50,418
Well, perhaps Jorge
is not for you, then.

531
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:56,060
No, you know...
Maybe Jorge is for me.

532
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:58,459
- Let's do this.
- Great.

533
00:29:58,563 --> 00:30:00,531
Stacy, where is the shampooing girl,
what's her name?

534
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:02,156
We need to get Corky washed.

535
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:03,996
You mean Lynn? She quit.

536
00:30:04,102 --> 00:30:05,660
Come again?

537
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:06,737
She quit.

538
00:30:06,838 --> 00:30:09,033
She called this morning.
I left a message on your desk.

539
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:12,667
She said that if anyone asks,
that she was working down at Gina's.

540
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:14,840
Working at Gina's what?

541
00:30:14,946 --> 00:30:16,106
Gina's salon.

542
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:21,049
Okay, well...

543
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:24,588
Today is your lucky day.
I'll wash you myself. Come with me.

544
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:28,548
Have a seat.

545
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,627
Don't forget to use a cape.

546
00:30:30,728 --> 00:30:34,960
It's not my first day at the picnic, Stacy.
I know all about the cape, ja?

547
00:30:37,302 --> 00:30:39,099
Shouldn't I be taking my jacket off?

548
00:30:39,204 --> 00:30:41,229
Leave the jacket,
take off your pants. I'm kidding.

549
00:30:44,576 --> 00:30:46,373
Stacy! Stacy!

550
00:30:50,648 --> 00:30:52,343
I'm sorry, I just need a moment.

551
00:30:57,322 --> 00:30:58,914
Looks good, don't it?

552
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:01,548
Girl, it looks good.
That's all you?

553
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:04,287
This is my hair. Blown out.

554
00:31:04,395 --> 00:31:07,387
Yup, girl, it's nice!

555
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:14,461
Well, Gina, I'm booking you, girl.
When can you get me in?

556
00:31:15,073 --> 00:31:19,237
- I can take you tomorrow at 10:00.
- I'll be here at 8:45.

557
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,811
Say, now, mama,
how you doing?

558
00:31:29,988 --> 00:31:33,651
Damn!
You a nice little pound cake.

559
00:31:36,494 --> 00:31:37,825
How y'all doin'?

560
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:40,489
Y'all want a little chocolate?
Y'all don't want nothin'?

561
00:31:40,598 --> 00:31:43,032
Y'all looking, sittin' over here,
lookin' all done up and thang.

562
00:31:43,134 --> 00:31:44,863
So, I figured y'all want somethin'.

563
00:31:45,703 --> 00:31:48,866
So y'all just gonna float on
past a brother.

564
00:31:48,973 --> 00:31:51,635
Brother can't get no communicato?
A'ight, then.

565
00:31:55,213 --> 00:31:56,612
How you doin'?

566
00:31:56,714 --> 00:32:00,548
Damn, you a thick one!
You got top and bottom.

567
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:04,653
Gimme a quarter. I promised my mama
I'd call her as soon as I fell in love.

568
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:07,589
Whassup, little man?
What you sellin'?

569
00:32:07,692 --> 00:32:09,057
Candy bars.

570
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,957
See, I'm raisin' money
so I can shoot my music video.

571
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:13,189
If you want, you could be in it.

572
00:32:13,298 --> 00:32:14,890
Come and get low wit' it.
Shake it like a salt shaker.

573
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:16,500
Shake it like a salt shaker!

574
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:18,360
What is your name?

575
00:32:18,469 --> 00:32:21,870
I'm Willie, a.k.a. Will-Boogie,
from Decatur, Georgia.

576
00:32:21,973 --> 00:32:23,565
That my daddy pawn shop next door.

577
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:25,142
What yo' name, meal?

578
00:32:25,243 --> 00:32:27,370
My name is Gina. I own the shop.

579
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:29,776
And if you want to sell
your candy in here,

580
00:32:29,881 --> 00:32:32,873
you gonna have to learn how to be
a little more courteous to the ladies.

581
00:32:32,984 --> 00:32:35,316
- I got that, no doubt. My bad, Gina.
- All right. Okay.

582
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,888
So, Miss Gina, you gonna buy
some five-dollar chocolate

583
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:40,287
to go with those healthy
milk-sacks you got?

584
00:32:50,101 --> 00:32:53,332
Don't bring your little behind back here
till you learn how to speak to a lady!

585
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:58,074
That's what you get!

586
00:33:02,113 --> 00:33:04,104
She loves me.

587
00:33:19,697 --> 00:33:22,894
Don't you even try, girl.
I don't know whose bike this is.

588
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,730
- Can I have one?
- Can you have one?

589
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:25,803
Can I have one?

590
00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:28,797
Hey, Nana.

591
00:33:28,906 --> 00:33:30,498
- How's my girls?
- Good.

592
00:33:30,608 --> 00:33:31,870
- Hey, Paulette.
- All right?

593
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:33,375
Go and get cleaned up, baby.

594
00:33:37,648 --> 00:33:39,275
It feels good to be home.

595
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:41,875
So, Gina, how was it?

596
00:33:41,986 --> 00:33:43,647
Well, it was...

597
00:33:47,258 --> 00:33:49,089
I know that bike out there ain't yours.

598
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:51,093
No, girl. That's P.J.'s bike.

599
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:54,187
- I ain't even gonna ask.
- A'ight, Mama.

600
00:33:54,298 --> 00:33:55,788
I'm gone.

601
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,891
- Bye.
- Bye, Darnelle.

602
00:33:58,002 --> 00:34:02,098
- You be careful on that bike, hear?
- Mama, I will.

603
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:08,376
Gina, I swear, it's more trouble
havin' that girl than it was makin' her.

604
00:34:08,479 --> 00:34:10,777
See, your father-in-law
had a crooked one.

605
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:14,249
I had to walk around the corner
just to get on it.

606
00:34:14,352 --> 00:34:15,580
So, what were you...

607
00:34:22,026 --> 00:34:25,689
So. Must've put it on the brother.
'cause the fool wouldn't leave me alone

608
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:29,062
I mean, he was blowin' up my phone,
my girlfriend's phone,

609
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:31,101
drivin' by my house.
My mama's house

610
00:34:31,202 --> 00:34:33,033
This dude was straight trippin'

611
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:36,470
So I did what any other normal
black woman would do

612
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:38,098
'Cause a white girl wouldn't do this.

613
00:34:38,209 --> 00:34:40,268
- They go down to the police station
- Come on.

614
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:43,472
Get a restrainin' order.
Piss the man off and have him waitin'

615
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:46,277
in the damn bushes
with a butcher knife ready to kill a bitch

616
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,883
- had to get creative
- That's great.

617
00:34:49,987 --> 00:34:52,114
Go ghetto on a black man

618
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:54,987
- Y'all say "ghetto"
- Ghetto!

619
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:59,257
- Ghetto!
- A sistah had to get sinister on a Negro

620
00:34:59,363 --> 00:35:02,628
Basically. A woman
had to do what she had to do

621
00:35:02,733 --> 00:35:05,293
- What'd you do?
- I lied and told him was pregnant

622
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:10,340
I ain't seen that fool in ten years
I ain't lyin'. Ladies wrong or right?

623
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:11,965
I wanna hear from ya, Hotlanta.

624
00:35:12,076 --> 00:35:14,306
Holler at Helen
or hit me on my website

625
00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:18,143
at www.how-to-shake-a-nigga.com.

626
00:35:18,249 --> 00:35:20,376
No, she didn't.

627
00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:23,113
I didn't know you could say
the "N" word on the radio.

628
00:35:23,221 --> 00:35:28,181
No, no, sweetie.
She can say it, you just can't.

629
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,384
You know what?

630
00:35:30,495 --> 00:35:34,329
Now, you could be black, white,
ghetto past, no ghetto past,

631
00:35:34,432 --> 00:35:36,627
I ain't nobody sayin'
the "N" word up in this shop.

632
00:35:37,502 --> 00:35:41,529
And no "bitches" and "hos," either.
'Cept for the ones who don't leave a tip.

633
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:44,039
That's for real, that's for real.

634
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:46,667
But we will be wearin' our smocks
unless your name is Gina.

635
00:35:46,777 --> 00:35:48,540
I forgot.

636
00:35:53,951 --> 00:35:58,285
Look good, don't it?
I had to put a little Motherland flavor on it.

637
00:35:58,389 --> 00:36:00,016
Some sexiness.

638
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:04,290
It's a little too sexy.

639
00:36:04,395 --> 00:36:05,953
You might wanna use
some of that mud cloth

640
00:36:06,063 --> 00:36:07,860
and like, kinda, you know,
cover up the girls.

641
00:36:07,965 --> 00:36:10,490
"Does my sexiness offend you?"

642
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:12,193
No. I'm just sayin'...

643
00:36:12,303 --> 00:36:14,771
"Does it come as a surprise?"

644
00:36:14,872 --> 00:36:15,839
Ah, Lord!

645
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:20,536
"That I dance like I got diamonds
at the meetin' of my thighs?"

646
00:36:20,645 --> 00:36:23,273
Lord, here we go.
Her and her Miss Angeloo.

647
00:36:23,381 --> 00:36:27,579
Angelou.
"Does my haughtiness offend you?

648
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:30,518
"Don't you take it awful hard

649
00:36:30,621 --> 00:36:35,024
"'cause I laugh
like I got gold mines

650
00:36:35,126 --> 00:36:37,617
diggin' in my own backyard."

651
00:36:38,896 --> 00:36:40,989
Don't dig too deep,
Miss Josephine.

652
00:36:42,066 --> 00:36:46,366
"Leavin' behind nights
of terror and fear

653
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:52,170
"I rise into a daybreak
that is wondrously clear.

654
00:36:52,276 --> 00:36:56,872
"I rise bringin' the gifts
that the ancestors gave.

655
00:36:56,981 --> 00:37:00,815
"I am the dream
and the hope of the slave.

656
00:37:00,918 --> 00:37:02,749
I rise."

657
00:37:02,853 --> 00:37:04,047
I rise!

658
00:37:04,188 --> 00:37:05,883
I rise!

659
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:07,014
Yeah, I rise!

660
00:37:13,598 --> 00:37:16,533
All right, let's rise our asses
back to work. Come on, now.

661
00:38:08,986 --> 00:38:11,819
Hotlanta. Helen be talkin'
to ya standin' up.

662
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:14,823
'Cause I just went
and got me a bikini wax.

663
00:38:14,925 --> 00:38:17,826
damn! That ain't natural.
Doin' that torture to yourself!

664
00:38:17,928 --> 00:38:19,896
What's the big deal
'bout some stray hair?

665
00:38:19,997 --> 00:38:22,363
You be doin' it to look
all clean for your man.

666
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:25,196
But it hurts so damn much. You don't
want him comin' nowhere hear it!

667
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:27,567
Man, Gina, you can make
some serious bling,

668
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:29,867
you start doin' some waxes
up in here, girl.

669
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:32,408
You like landscapin',
why don't you plant yourself a garden?

670
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:35,138
Please, honey. My man loves it.

671
00:38:35,246 --> 00:38:36,406
I know that's right.

672
00:38:36,514 --> 00:38:38,243
And it helps 'em
know where they goin'.

673
00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:40,909
Girl, ain't nobody gonna come
over to your house if they can't find it.

674
00:38:41,018 --> 00:38:44,249
Well, my man
found my door just fine.

675
00:38:44,355 --> 00:38:45,652
That's a revolvin' door.

676
00:38:45,756 --> 00:38:47,485
Okay, nasty heifers.

677
00:38:47,591 --> 00:38:50,924
You know, real men
like a woman natural and wild!

678
00:38:51,028 --> 00:38:54,225
Girl, please, you are preaching
to your damn self, honey.

679
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:58,393
My man likes it trimmed and perfect.
He even waxes his own brows.

680
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:01,164
Oh, girl, you got one
o' them cryin' men, don't you?

681
00:39:01,272 --> 00:39:03,263
No. No, I don't.

682
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:04,773
You show me a man can't cry,

683
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:07,036
and I'll show you one
that's hittin' somebody.

684
00:39:07,144 --> 00:39:08,736
I'm gonna let him cry.

685
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,939
I only got time for one cryin' man.

686
00:39:11,048 --> 00:39:13,573
And in my house,
it better be the one wearin' the diapers.

687
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:18,948
Well, how about when you're
makin' mad, passionate love...

688
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:22,417
...and he reaches his climax,

689
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:25,086
and that one little tear
starts rollin' down his face

690
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:28,461
like Denzel Washington in Glory?

691
00:39:31,635 --> 00:39:33,500
Then you got him whipped!

692
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:37,964
She had to say Denzel.
She couldn't have said Brad Pitt.

693
00:39:38,075 --> 00:39:39,702
Hell, she coulda said Bozo the Clown.

694
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:41,471
Hey, darlin'!

695
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:44,514
How you doin'?
Bet you no good, darlin'.

696
00:39:45,816 --> 00:39:48,478
Look at this!
Is that Italian marble?

697
00:39:48,586 --> 00:39:51,817
Girl, who y'all got invested
up in here, Ted Turner?

698
00:39:51,922 --> 00:39:54,117
Lord, Miss Rita got catfish dinner,

699
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:56,420
sock-it-to-me cake
and blueberry bean pie.

700
00:39:56,527 --> 00:39:59,360
- What y'all want, darlings?
- Excuse me. Excuse me, Rita?

701
00:39:59,463 --> 00:40:00,987
How you doin', darlin'?
Get in line, sweetheart.

702
00:40:01,098 --> 00:40:02,565
Get in line?
I don't think you understand.

703
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:04,156
I'm Gina.
I'm the new owner of this place.

704
00:40:04,268 --> 00:40:06,065
- And I'd appreciate...
- You the new owner?

705
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:07,899
I'm so glad
you the new owner, baby,

706
00:40:08,005 --> 00:40:11,406
'cause, you know, Miss Angeline,
well, she used to skim off my fish dinners.

707
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:13,340
You know, she's a Christian,
but I think she La Cosa Nostra

708
00:40:13,444 --> 00:40:14,411
Hold this for me.

709
00:40:14,512 --> 00:40:18,710
Here, darlin', I'll always have
a plate of food for you, Gina.

710
00:40:18,816 --> 00:40:21,250
That's free food.
You need a extra piece of monkey bread?

711
00:40:21,352 --> 00:40:23,786
The monkey just jump right outta me.
I don't know what happens to her.

712
00:40:23,888 --> 00:40:25,150
- And then lookit, we got the greens...
- Oh, you!

713
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:27,247
Yeah, you, there. Hey.

714
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:31,658
Could you go ahead and park my car,
and just let me tip you later, because...

715
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:33,229
Shit. Hold this for me.

716
00:40:35,065 --> 00:40:37,056
Terri, how you doin'?
One second.

717
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:41,628
'Scuse me? Gimme them damn keys!
What's wrong with you?

718
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:46,536
Where'd the valet go?

719
00:40:46,644 --> 00:40:49,010
He's... goin' to take a coffee break.

720
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:53,641
- What are you doin' around here?
- Look what Mindy at Jorge's did to me!

721
00:40:54,351 --> 00:40:56,080
I look like a scarecrow!

722
00:40:58,722 --> 00:41:00,485
You saved my hair, Gina.

723
00:41:00,591 --> 00:41:02,889
Well, don't make me
have to save it again, girl.

724
00:41:02,993 --> 00:41:04,085
I'm coming here.

725
00:41:04,995 --> 00:41:07,429
Monkey bread?
It just come out of me like that.

726
00:41:07,531 --> 00:41:09,624
- No, no, thank you.
- For sure?

727
00:41:09,733 --> 00:41:11,530
I made it fresh this mornin'!
You gonna love it.

728
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:13,626
- I got some greens, some okra, knuckles.
- Rita, Rita.

729
00:41:13,737 --> 00:41:14,863
You gonna love it.

730
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:16,337
She says she don't want none.

731
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,705
Okay, my bad. I'm just tryin'
to put a little fat on her.

732
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,573
- Take that with you, darlin'.
- No, I really shouldn't.

733
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:24,011
You see, Steven wants me
to lose a few pounds.

734
00:41:24,114 --> 00:41:26,412
- Who is Steven?
- Her husband.

735
00:41:26,517 --> 00:41:27,711
He wouldn't be singin' that song

736
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:30,013
if you had one of them
J. Lo/Beyonc booties.

737
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:33,619
Or if he had one o' those.

738
00:41:34,358 --> 00:41:35,689
This is the picture
I was talkin' about...

739
00:41:35,793 --> 00:41:39,388
Damn! Now, see,
that's just too much ass.

740
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:42,728
See, now, if a plane crash,
we could eat for days.

741
00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:46,096
- That's all burger, right there.
- Enjoy the view?

742
00:41:46,203 --> 00:41:48,228
- Take a picture.
- All right.

743
00:41:48,772 --> 00:41:51,832
Look at these... Get yo' ass
out of my window 'fore I call the police!

744
00:41:51,942 --> 00:41:55,400
This ain't Magic City!
Broke-asses!

745
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,614
- You see them pervs over there?
- You know, I really do miss Steven.

746
00:41:58,716 --> 00:42:01,549
- Seems like he's been gone forever.
- He gone again?

747
00:42:01,652 --> 00:42:04,246
Well, where's he off to this time,
Mr. Big-Time Sports Attorney?

748
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:08,849
Hawaii, three weeks.
He's closin' some big deal or somethin'.

749
00:42:08,959 --> 00:42:12,224
He's tryin' to close a deal
on smackin' some Hawaiian ass.

750
00:42:12,329 --> 00:42:15,526
Girl, he's down there
bein' a Don Ho.

751
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:18,597
- He tappin' on somethin'.
- Tappin'? What's tappin?

752
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:23,001
- Tappin', tappin', tappin'.
- No, Steven's not like that.

753
00:42:23,107 --> 00:42:26,770
He, you know, he loves me.
He just works really hard.

754
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:28,174
I bet he do.

755
00:42:29,179 --> 00:42:32,114
- I do want to look pretty for him, though.
- And you will.

756
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:34,548
I cannot believe that Jorge
passed me off on Mindy.

757
00:42:34,652 --> 00:42:36,779
I mean, that shop is completely
out of control since you left.

758
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:39,014
- Well, good. That's what he gets.
- Sorry.

759
00:42:40,791 --> 00:42:42,122
Speak o' the devil!

760
00:42:44,628 --> 00:42:47,153
My angel, sweetness,
my God, I'm so sorry.

761
00:42:47,264 --> 00:42:48,993
I heard about the mishap
with your hair,

762
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:52,125
and I want you to know
that Mindy has been released.

763
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:56,673
Sweetheart, don't worry about that.
Gina's taking care of me.

764
00:42:56,774 --> 00:42:57,741
Gina who?

765
00:42:57,841 --> 00:42:59,365
You know, Gina Gina.

766
00:42:59,476 --> 00:43:01,603
- Say "hello," Gina.
- It's Gina, bitch.

767
00:43:02,479 --> 00:43:03,741
Bye, Jorge.

768
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:06,807
- That felt good!
- Yes, it did!

769
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:12,016
Can you get her
a free cappuccino, please?

770
00:43:12,122 --> 00:43:14,784
- The devil is everywhere. It don't mean...
- Be nice!

771
00:43:14,892 --> 00:43:16,325
I ain't talking to that woman.

772
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:19,260
So what you girls think
about that Janice Jackson?

773
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:21,621
Janet. Janet, baby.

774
00:43:21,732 --> 00:43:23,324
Janet... Jackson.

775
00:43:24,468 --> 00:43:26,026
She's crazy, huh?

776
00:43:26,136 --> 00:43:29,765
- Why she gotta be crazy?
- Well, you know, with the titty and all that.

777
00:43:29,873 --> 00:43:32,000
- What's wrong with the titty?
- No, I like...

778
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:33,098
You like titties?

779
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:34,404
No, I mean...

780
00:43:36,981 --> 00:43:39,347
I don't know if I'm fittin' in here.

781
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:41,543
- Well, you just got here.
- Yeah, I know.

782
00:43:41,652 --> 00:43:46,783
I know I just got here,
but I feel really, really...

783
00:43:47,658 --> 00:43:48,625
white.

784
00:43:48,726 --> 00:43:52,162
You feel really white
as opposed to what other color?

785
00:43:52,262 --> 00:43:55,527
You know what I mean.
I'm not as hip as you guys are.

786
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:58,932
Don't get me wrong, I can handle
the girls, as lame as I think they are.

787
00:43:59,036 --> 00:44:00,970
I can roll with the punches.

788
00:44:01,071 --> 00:44:04,529
But the fact is, I've only
had one client since I got here,

789
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:05,904
and you gave her to me.

790
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:08,205
So... maybe I should just go.

791
00:44:09,213 --> 00:44:11,579
Who should go
is that crazy-ass lady out there

792
00:44:11,682 --> 00:44:13,741
hustlin' them bean pies
and monkey bread.

793
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:16,513
- Like she got Tourette's or somethin'.
- I don't know.

794
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:18,019
I ain't never seen
nobody do nothin' like that.

795
00:44:18,122 --> 00:44:21,717
Got a twitch or somethin'.
No, Lynn, you fine.

796
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:23,520
You know,
like when I was at Jorge's.

797
00:44:23,627 --> 00:44:28,655
Shoot. You think it wasn't hard
bein' the only "moniker" up in the shop?

798
00:44:29,299 --> 00:44:32,268
But I stuck it out,
and people warmed up...

799
00:44:32,369 --> 00:44:36,738
And eventually, it was like, blam!
I was doin' the damn thing.

800
00:44:38,642 --> 00:44:40,075
And so will you.

801
00:44:42,413 --> 00:44:44,847
Besides, you can't leave me
with these crazy people.

802
00:44:45,315 --> 00:44:48,011
Girl, I knew you liked them greens!

803
00:44:48,585 --> 00:44:52,487
You keep eatin' like that,
you gonna grow a big ol' Petey Pablo,

804
00:44:52,589 --> 00:44:55,717
Lil Jon and the EastSide Boyz,
Ying Yang Twin booty!

805
00:44:56,627 --> 00:44:59,926
Big booty just like Ida got.
You know, turnips did all o' that.

806
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:01,388
Girl, I knew you liked 'em.

807
00:45:01,498 --> 00:45:03,625
- Thank you, Gina.
- No problem, girl.

808
00:45:03,734 --> 00:45:05,861
- I got your back.
- Me, too.

809
00:45:05,969 --> 00:45:07,095
All right.

810
00:45:07,838 --> 00:45:10,568
- What?!
- I got hungry.

811
00:45:10,674 --> 00:45:12,699
- They're good.
- I see.

812
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:15,910
The oppressor.

813
00:45:16,013 --> 00:45:18,481
- Who?
- State Board.

814
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:26,287
I'm Gina. I'm the new owner.

815
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,381
Well, guess what, Gina-new-owner?

816
00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:31,950
You have some major problems.
Inspector Crawford, State Board.

817
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:34,792
I have to cite you
for the discarded equipment

818
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:36,195
you have stacked up
out in the alley.

819
00:45:37,468 --> 00:45:39,868
Big Mike's Moving & Hauling
is picking that up today.

820
00:45:41,004 --> 00:45:43,871
- They always are.
- No. They real...

821
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:52,743
This is for $500.
Come on, man, I just bought this place.

822
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:54,977
I can't afford to be gettin' hit
with tickets like this.

823
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:57,610
You sure can't.
Next one will be 1,000.

824
00:45:57,721 --> 00:45:59,621
One more after that
and I shut you down.

825
00:45:59,723 --> 00:46:01,247
Have a nice day.

826
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:03,019
"Have a nice day."

827
00:46:08,065 --> 00:46:09,396
Now y'all comin'.

828
00:46:15,038 --> 00:46:18,007
Well, your timin' is perfect.
Y'all slow.

829
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:19,871
My bad. I been
runnin' solo for a month,

830
00:46:19,977 --> 00:46:22,468
and my boss, he think
I'm some kind of slave.

831
00:46:22,579 --> 00:46:23,841
Sign here.

832
00:46:24,848 --> 00:46:26,042
How long was you down for?

833
00:46:27,551 --> 00:46:29,849
Four months. Paroled out early.

834
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:33,047
- Possession?
- Now, why you gotta assume a brother...

835
00:46:33,857 --> 00:46:36,451
Illegal sale of a restricted narcotic.

836
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:40,062
So, where's the countertops and stuff?

837
00:46:40,931 --> 00:46:44,162
- Everything is back there in the alley.
- A'ight.

838
00:46:44,268 --> 00:46:47,931
By the way, who does your hair?
Your braids is tight.

839
00:46:48,505 --> 00:46:50,166
Thanks. I do it myself.

840
00:46:50,274 --> 00:46:51,639
Come on.

841
00:46:51,742 --> 00:46:54,233
For real. I used to braid
in the shop around the way.

842
00:46:54,344 --> 00:46:56,175
Then I caught this little case,
you know.

843
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,714
But even in the pen, I did braid
all the homies' hair on the block.

844
00:47:02,252 --> 00:47:03,412
You like drivin' that truck?

845
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,011
Ain't nothin' really else out there.

846
00:47:08,258 --> 00:47:09,782
Well... we may take...

847
00:47:10,894 --> 00:47:13,920
Dawg, how long it gon' take?

848
00:47:20,938 --> 00:47:23,372
Our boy is fine.

849
00:47:23,473 --> 00:47:25,065
Damn fine.

850
00:47:25,709 --> 00:47:28,303
I'd do him in a heartbeat
if I wasn't so damn fertile.

851
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,877
- And didn't have a husband.
- He is cute.

852
00:47:34,885 --> 00:47:35,943
Thanks.

853
00:47:37,588 --> 00:47:38,714
Thanks.

854
00:47:39,957 --> 00:47:41,720
You got me next, right?

855
00:47:42,659 --> 00:47:44,388
I think I was here before you.

856
00:47:44,494 --> 00:47:46,758
What the hell is you talkin' about?
You ain't got no hair.

857
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:49,492
- What?
- What's he gon' do, braid your scalp?

858
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:50,794
- You watch your...
- Ladies, listen.

859
00:47:50,901 --> 00:47:52,869
I promise I'll take care of both o' y'all.

860
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:54,904
- I think she was here first.
- But she...

861
00:47:55,005 --> 00:47:57,997
Let me just take care o' her
and then I'll definitely gon' get back to you,

862
00:47:58,108 --> 00:48:01,339
'cause in my mind, I'm still tryin'
to figure out how I'm gonna...

863
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:09,717
But I'm telling you,
somethin' just ain't right.

864
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:14,821
It's like he's too good-looking.

865
00:48:14,925 --> 00:48:17,325
You can't tell by looking
at the brother if he's gender-specific.

866
00:48:17,427 --> 00:48:21,056
Josephine, come on!
Look at the muscles on that boy.

867
00:48:21,164 --> 00:48:22,995
Fifty percent pumpin' iron,

868
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:26,968
and the rest from fightin'
the brothers off that booty.

869
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:28,901
He got a little swish down river.

870
00:48:31,141 --> 00:48:33,075
He is beautiful, ain't he?

871
00:48:34,845 --> 00:48:37,075
- Straight diamond in the rough.
- All shiny.

872
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:38,807
'Scuse me. Let me see
if he wants some cappuccino.

873
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:40,315
No, sh...

874
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:42,408
- Dang.
- I don't know.

875
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:44,487
I think he's straight.

876
00:48:46,189 --> 00:48:47,451
You are so new.

877
00:48:47,557 --> 00:48:48,751
James, you want a cappuccino?

878
00:48:48,859 --> 00:48:50,190
- Yeah, please.
- Here you go.

879
00:48:50,861 --> 00:48:52,795
- You want one?
- No. I'm okay, thanks.

880
00:48:52,896 --> 00:48:54,090
Cappuccino?

881
00:48:59,202 --> 00:49:00,294
Swish-swish.

882
00:49:00,404 --> 00:49:02,201
You better work

883
00:49:02,306 --> 00:49:03,398
Work it, girl

884
00:49:03,507 --> 00:49:04,872
- Cover girl.
- Do your thing!

885
00:49:04,975 --> 00:49:07,205
- Shante, shante.
- On the runway!

886
00:49:07,311 --> 00:49:08,835
- Work, cover gir...
- Get that phone.

887
00:49:12,015 --> 00:49:14,313
It's a great day
for a press and curl here at Gin...

888
00:49:17,888 --> 00:49:19,150
Hold on.

889
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:21,951
It's a Darnelle.

890
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,052
What up, D?

891
00:49:25,228 --> 00:49:26,422
You where?

892
00:49:41,945 --> 00:49:45,278
How does a grown-ass woman
get herself into this kind of trouble?

893
00:49:45,382 --> 00:49:48,078
How was I supposed to know
the bike was stolen?

894
00:49:48,185 --> 00:49:49,447
It don't matter.

895
00:49:49,553 --> 00:49:52,579
You gonna have to start makin'
some better choices with these men.

896
00:49:52,689 --> 00:49:54,919
This is the last time
I'm bailin' you out.

897
00:49:55,025 --> 00:49:57,255
Next time, I'ma let
your little butt sit there

898
00:49:57,361 --> 00:50:01,161
and let the chicks from "C" Block
pass you around for a carton o' cigarettes.

899
00:50:01,264 --> 00:50:03,255
They'll love a little freak like you.

900
00:50:03,367 --> 00:50:07,030
- You gonna tell my mom about this?
- No, I ain't gonna tell your mama.

901
00:50:07,137 --> 00:50:08,934
I should.

902
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:11,132
- Look...
- Why raise her blood pressure?

903
00:50:11,241 --> 00:50:14,802
Thank you, okay? Thank you.
Look, I'm sorry and I'll pay you back.

904
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:19,314
- With what, D? You ain't even workin'.
- I know that.

905
00:50:19,416 --> 00:50:22,749
But, look, I'll find a way.
I promise.

906
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:25,754
That's for sure. Ain't no secret
I'm gettin' my money back.

907
00:50:26,723 --> 00:50:29,715
I'ma get my money
one way or another.

908
00:50:45,509 --> 00:50:46,806
Cappuccino?

909
00:50:51,581 --> 00:50:53,913
Cappuccino? Water?

910
00:50:54,985 --> 00:50:57,647
There you go.
Say it like you mean it.

911
00:50:57,754 --> 00:51:00,154
No, scratch that.
Like you love it.

912
00:51:03,593 --> 00:51:06,289
- You want a cappuccino?
- No, baby.

913
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:08,762
I don't eat or drink
nothing I can't spell.

914
00:51:14,538 --> 00:51:16,938
You must be
like the spellin' bee champ.

915
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,600
Don't look like your mouth
is shy to a fork at all.

916
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:26,511
Y'all hold it down.
I'm goin' to make a bank run.

917
00:51:39,229 --> 00:51:40,719
Say now, lover.

918
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:45,125
Lookin' like a piece o' red velvet cake,
so nice and sweet.

919
00:51:45,235 --> 00:51:48,227
Is your body named Visa?
'Cause it's everywhere I wanna be.

920
00:51:49,739 --> 00:51:51,206
Why don't you get some business?

921
00:51:51,308 --> 00:51:53,970
I got some business.
I'm shootin' footage for my music video.

922
00:51:54,077 --> 00:51:56,545
If you want, you can come be in it.
Come shake a little somethin'.

923
00:51:56,646 --> 00:51:59,114
Let me guess, you probably
want me to wear a bathing suit

924
00:51:59,216 --> 00:52:02,014
or some tight booty shorts
with a fishnet halter top, right?

925
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:05,145
You ain't gotta wear no fishnet.
You could just wear a T-shirt.

926
00:52:06,156 --> 00:52:08,249
Just as long as you
don't mind gettin' it wet.

927
00:52:09,759 --> 00:52:12,387
- What's that you're listenin' to?
- Bach.

928
00:52:12,496 --> 00:52:14,657
Are you listenin' to Pac, too?
That's what I listen to.

929
00:52:14,764 --> 00:52:19,133
Bach... as in Johann Sebastian.
Classical composer.

930
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:23,405
He the one look like the old dude
on the oatmeal box, right?

931
00:52:23,507 --> 00:52:25,168
Yeah. That's the one.

932
00:52:25,275 --> 00:52:26,833
Why you listen to that boring stuff?

933
00:52:26,943 --> 00:52:29,002
It's not boring. It's art.

934
00:52:30,614 --> 00:52:34,482
Dang.
Well, you got yo' art...

935
00:52:35,952 --> 00:52:37,419
...and I got mine.

936
00:52:37,521 --> 00:52:39,512
Now that's a money shot right there.

937
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:42,148
Let's hat up, y'all.

938
00:52:42,259 --> 00:52:44,557
Cracker Barrel "bring-a-friend"
gon' be over!

939
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:47,186
I'm drivin'.
Y'all gon' be too full to walk back.

940
00:52:52,636 --> 00:52:53,603
Is that a purse?

941
00:52:53,703 --> 00:52:55,898
Nah. It's a man bag.

942
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:57,098
A man bag?

943
00:52:57,207 --> 00:52:58,333
Yeah, a man bag.

944
00:52:58,441 --> 00:53:00,636
It's like the hottest new accessory
in men's fashion.

945
00:53:00,744 --> 00:53:03,304
You got some man lipstick
in that bag, James?

946
00:53:05,448 --> 00:53:08,349
They done took metrosexual too far.

947
00:53:08,451 --> 00:53:12,251
- Darnelle, you wanna come?
- I gotta stay and watch Vanessa.

948
00:53:14,624 --> 00:53:15,591
Lynn, you comin'?

949
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:18,388
No, I'ma hang out. I'll be fine.

950
00:53:18,495 --> 00:53:20,292
A'ight. I'ma bring you
back somethin' anyway.

951
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:34,810
Them girls don't like me
so much, do they?

952
00:53:34,911 --> 00:53:36,640
They don't even know you.

953
00:53:36,746 --> 00:53:40,238
How do you get to know someone
without trying to get to know someone?

954
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:41,840
Like askin' 'em to lunch?

955
00:53:41,952 --> 00:53:44,045
I mean, well, some folks
just feel comfortable

956
00:53:44,154 --> 00:53:46,247
kickin' it with people they
have somethin' in common with.

957
00:53:46,356 --> 00:53:49,223
That's just racial profilin'.
That's all that is.

958
00:53:49,326 --> 00:53:51,260
When I worked
in my mama's shop in Blue Ridge,

959
00:53:51,361 --> 00:53:53,522
I did black, white, polka-dotted hair.

960
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:54,597
It don't matter.

961
00:53:54,698 --> 00:53:57,189
Well, this ain't your mama's shop
in Blue Ridge.

962
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:59,427
This is the SWATS, the ghetto.

963
00:53:59,536 --> 00:54:01,834
And you need to show people
that you tryin' to fit in, girl.

964
00:54:01,938 --> 00:54:03,064
I mean, look the part.

965
00:54:03,173 --> 00:54:04,936
I'm not followin'.

966
00:54:05,041 --> 00:54:08,169
Okay, Lynn, look,
it is all about the visual, okay?

967
00:54:08,278 --> 00:54:10,303
You could be
the best hair stylist up in here,

968
00:54:10,413 --> 00:54:12,176
but can't nobody tell by lookin' at you!

969
00:54:12,282 --> 00:54:16,184
Girl, presentation... is the key.

970
00:54:16,286 --> 00:54:19,585
Presentation?
What do you suggest?

971
00:54:19,689 --> 00:54:21,247
Just wait and see.

972
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:24,691
Just trust me.

973
00:54:24,794 --> 00:54:26,318
Miss Gina! I've been seein'

974
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:28,897
everything you have been doin'
around here with the beauty shop,

975
00:54:28,999 --> 00:54:30,933
and the shop is fabulous, honey!

976
00:54:31,034 --> 00:54:33,332
- Thank you, hon.
- But if you wanna let these divas have it,

977
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:35,131
you need one of my handbags
for the runway,

978
00:54:35,238 --> 00:54:37,968
because it's spring,
and you don't want to be caught in suede.

979
00:54:38,074 --> 00:54:39,837
- That is cute.
- Yes, Miss Thing, honey.

980
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:41,171
And the pink,
you gotta have your pink.

981
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:44,907
It's spring, girl.
Push, push, fierce! It's fierce!

982
00:54:45,015 --> 00:54:46,607
You always gettin' me started out here.

983
00:54:46,716 --> 00:54:49,241
- Come on, now, Chris.
- Girl, honey.

984
00:54:49,352 --> 00:54:51,718
- Better work it.
- I'm gonna work it, girl.

985
00:54:51,821 --> 00:54:53,948
- I'll catch you.
- I'll catch you.

986
00:54:54,057 --> 00:54:56,685
- Now, push, baby.
- Push, diva, and catch it, honey.

987
00:54:56,793 --> 00:55:00,251
I know that's right! I done talked to you
about slammin' in front of my shop!

988
00:55:00,363 --> 00:55:02,092
...if you're gonna let
these girls have it, diva!

989
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:09,665
Oh, my God.

990
00:55:10,607 --> 00:55:13,235
Hi, Gina!

991
00:55:14,077 --> 00:55:15,840
You like it?
Isn't it cute?

992
00:55:15,945 --> 00:55:18,675
And don't look over here, honey.
Darnelle did that.

993
00:55:18,782 --> 00:55:20,545
- It look good, right?
- It sure do.

994
00:55:22,185 --> 00:55:24,085
- Right?
- Right.

995
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:27,620
I just said,
"When in Rome..."

996
00:55:36,566 --> 00:55:37,828
Don't shake that baby loose.

997
00:55:37,934 --> 00:55:41,802
Oh, Lord. Don't do that or we gon' get
indecency charges up in here.

998
00:55:41,905 --> 00:55:44,465
See. I'm not one of these
so-called salad-chompin' sistahs

999
00:55:44,574 --> 00:55:47,702
that weighs 52 pounds
with a wet T-shirt on

1000
00:55:47,811 --> 00:55:51,440
I got hips, thighs and don't discriminate
against pies, you feel me?

1001
00:55:51,548 --> 00:55:55,348
But. Ladies. Y'all with this gettin'
your stomach stapled just to lose weight?

1002
00:55:55,452 --> 00:55:56,817
That ain't good

1003
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:00,253
Y'all know damn well that ain't no staples
in the stomach gonna stop you

1004
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:02,882
from poppin' one o' yo' mama's
famous biscuits in the mouth

1005
00:56:02,992 --> 00:56:04,960
Am in line?

1006
00:56:05,061 --> 00:56:07,427
Hotlanta. You know Helen's
keepin' it real with you

1007
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:09,293
Holler back at me.
I'll holler.

1008
00:56:09,399 --> 00:56:11,094
Holler!

1009
00:56:15,705 --> 00:56:16,865
Be quiet, y'all.
Oprah's on.

1010
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:25,078
- Where you think you goin'?
- I will be right back, okay?

1011
00:56:25,181 --> 00:56:26,341
I'll be right back.

1012
00:56:31,855 --> 00:56:33,345
That's what I'm talkin' about.

1013
00:56:34,791 --> 00:56:38,488
- Gimme some of that thug love.
- Thank you for comin' to see me.

1014
00:56:38,595 --> 00:56:40,028
What's happenin' with ya?
How ya livin'?

1015
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:42,598
Oh, man!

1016
00:56:43,633 --> 00:56:46,727
I got in some trouble,
and Gina loaned me this money,

1017
00:56:46,836 --> 00:56:48,997
so she got me workin' it off
in her salon.

1018
00:56:49,105 --> 00:56:51,096
They got you twisted, huh?

1019
00:56:51,207 --> 00:56:53,505
Come on, get with the money train
and let's ride.

1020
00:56:53,610 --> 00:56:54,941
Money train?

1021
00:56:55,044 --> 00:56:58,480
- I got a plan for you, Shorty.
- Oh, hell, yeah.

1022
00:56:58,581 --> 00:56:59,775
They'll be a'ight.

1023
00:56:59,883 --> 00:57:01,510
- Can we go shopping?
- I hear that.

1024
00:57:01,618 --> 00:57:03,279
I got somethin' for you, too.

1025
00:57:08,491 --> 00:57:12,427
Word for today is "chutzpah"
it is... if you don't... do you know that word?

1026
00:57:15,131 --> 00:57:18,726
- Who keeps unplugging this?
- It is a Yiddish word that means...

1027
00:57:22,806 --> 00:57:28,767
Amazing grace

1028
00:57:28,878 --> 00:57:30,402
Shut up, Josephine!

1029
00:57:32,649 --> 00:57:36,779
Dang! Are y'all havin' a slumber party?
Y'all didn't invite me?

1030
00:57:36,886 --> 00:57:39,719
- Willie, now is not the time!
- A'ight then.

1031
00:57:39,823 --> 00:57:41,347
Hey, but I just came by here to tell ya

1032
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:43,653
that I saw that inspector dude
over there at the barber shop.

1033
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:46,194
Damn! Like I need somethin' else
to be worried about.

1034
00:57:46,930 --> 00:57:48,795
Look, just hold him off, okay?
I'll be right back.

1035
00:57:48,898 --> 00:57:50,593
- I got that, Miss Gina.
- Go on over there with Auntie Lynn.

1036
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:52,600
Go on, go on, get...
come up outta here. Go ahead.

1037
00:57:55,972 --> 00:57:59,203
Come on, please be home, Joe.
I can't believe this.

1038
00:58:00,243 --> 00:58:02,234
Excuse me, sir,
you wanna buy some candy bars?

1039
00:58:02,345 --> 00:58:04,677
- No, thank you.
- I got Kit Kat, Mars, Snickers.

1040
00:58:04,781 --> 00:58:06,578
Come on, kid, not tonight.

1041
00:58:06,683 --> 00:58:09,151
Please let his sarcastic ass be here.

1042
00:58:10,887 --> 00:58:13,412
Please be there,
please be there, please be there.

1043
00:58:22,866 --> 00:58:23,958
I need your help.

1044
00:58:24,801 --> 00:58:26,632
Okay, let me grab a shirt.

1045
00:58:29,272 --> 00:58:31,172
I got... I got cherry, apple.

1046
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:33,733
Okay, well, how 'bout you buy
some candy, right?

1047
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:37,438
And I don't tell the fellas right here
that you got a Rolex in that briefcase.

1048
00:58:37,547 --> 00:58:38,673
I don't have a...

1049
00:58:47,624 --> 00:58:49,524
All right.
You say you got Blow Pops?

1050
00:58:49,626 --> 00:58:51,753
- Blow Pops.
- Every flavor, dawg.

1051
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:54,022
- Okay, I'll have a cherry.
- Five dollars. Okay, yeah.

1052
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:55,427
- You kinda broke.
- All right.

1053
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:04,004
All right, Joe!

1054
00:59:05,675 --> 00:59:08,439
Oh, my God!
Thank you, Joe. You saved me.

1055
00:59:10,246 --> 00:59:12,544
The generator is only
going to hold for a while.

1056
00:59:12,649 --> 00:59:14,139
You need to get this place fixed.

1057
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:15,376
I will.

1058
00:59:15,485 --> 00:59:19,854
- I just... I have to find the money to do it.
- You'll pay me later.

1059
00:59:19,956 --> 00:59:21,253
I'll help you out.

1060
00:59:27,463 --> 00:59:28,691
Bye, ladies.

1061
00:59:28,798 --> 00:59:30,459
Bye, Joe.

1062
00:59:34,404 --> 00:59:35,701
Miss Norris.

1063
00:59:36,773 --> 00:59:40,436
What, are we the only shop
in Atlanta you like to harass?

1064
00:59:40,543 --> 00:59:43,842
When Miss Angeline owned this place,
I ain't never seen y'all up in here.

1065
00:59:43,947 --> 00:59:45,414
I'm just doing my job.

1066
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:49,217
All right, look,
the generator is just temporary,

1067
00:59:49,319 --> 00:59:51,879
but I have an electrician,
he's coming on Monday,

1068
00:59:51,988 --> 00:59:53,649
he's gonna rewire
the whole place for me.

1069
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:56,884
It's all very nice, very nice,
but there's a new state regulation

1070
00:59:56,993 --> 00:59:58,927
that says all hairdryers
of this capacity

1071
00:59:59,028 --> 01:00:01,155
have to have
their own independent wall plug.

1072
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:02,231
This is a new regulation.

1073
01:00:02,332 --> 01:00:04,357
Well, how the hell
am I supposed to know about it?

1074
01:00:04,467 --> 01:00:05,969
I just told you.
That's how.

1075
01:00:05,969 --> 01:00:07,459
I just told you.
That's how.

1076
01:00:07,570 --> 01:00:11,301
Get up to speed, Miss Norris.
One more of those... closed for good.

1077
01:00:12,375 --> 01:00:14,240
Ladies.

1078
01:00:14,344 --> 01:00:16,312
A thousand dollars?!

1079
01:00:16,412 --> 01:00:19,973
I mean, it's like I take two steps forward
to get knocked three steps back.

1080
01:00:20,083 --> 01:00:23,280
Can you go down to the bank
and ask 'em to increase your loan?

1081
01:00:23,386 --> 01:00:27,152
Ask for a increase? I'm barely
keepin' up with the payments I got now.

1082
01:00:27,256 --> 01:00:29,247
I mean, somethin'
gotta turn around for this thing,

1083
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:31,554
otherwise, it ain't lookin'
too good for the shop.

1084
01:00:31,661 --> 01:00:34,061
No, Gina.
Now, we can do somethin'.

1085
01:00:34,163 --> 01:00:37,223
I got a little bit stored away.
We can have a garage sale.

1086
01:00:37,333 --> 01:00:39,426
I mean, how much do we need?

1087
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:43,897
Oh, shit!
Excuse me, Lord.

1088
01:00:44,007 --> 01:00:45,872
We need Jesus.

1089
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:47,534
Hey, y'all.

1090
01:00:48,544 --> 01:00:52,708
In before dawn.
Good night, Gina.

1091
01:00:55,618 --> 01:00:58,212
- Gina, did you tell her?
- No, I ain't tell her.

1092
01:00:58,321 --> 01:01:00,221
I swear Mama stay mad at me.

1093
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:01,290
I wonder why.

1094
01:01:01,391 --> 01:01:03,188
What happened
to "I'll be right back"?

1095
01:01:04,894 --> 01:01:05,952
My bad, Gina.

1096
01:01:06,562 --> 01:01:10,089
Glen just came down from New York,
and I hadn't seen him.

1097
01:01:10,199 --> 01:01:11,826
Girl, he has his own record label,

1098
01:01:11,934 --> 01:01:14,528
and he wants me
to be on his next album.

1099
01:01:15,438 --> 01:01:16,598
You can't even sing.

1100
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:20,206
A'ight. Look at this.

1101
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:25,677
What's this?

1102
01:01:25,782 --> 01:01:28,182
That's the bail money that I owe you.

1103
01:01:28,284 --> 01:01:30,912
Glen gave me some cash,
so now we even.

1104
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:32,510
I don't have to work
in the shop no more.

1105
01:01:32,622 --> 01:01:34,089
What'd you do to get that money?

1106
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:36,090
Now, Gina, come on, please!

1107
01:01:36,192 --> 01:01:38,786
You know I don't get down
like that, okay?

1108
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:43,192
But, look, if a dude wanna pay my bills,
I'm gonna let him pay my bills.

1109
01:01:43,299 --> 01:01:46,291
You know what? Shut up, Darnelle,
'cause you sound real stupid right now.

1110
01:01:46,402 --> 01:01:50,099
Okay? You just lazy.
You lazy and you wastin' your life.

1111
01:01:50,206 --> 01:01:51,798
And you wastin' my time!

1112
01:01:51,908 --> 01:01:54,433
Why don't you use
your little money to go buy a clue?

1113
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:13,556
Stacy, I don't understand.

1114
01:02:13,663 --> 01:02:16,154
Joanne Marcus
was supposed to be here at 10:00.

1115
01:02:16,265 --> 01:02:20,167
And this is not a coffee shop.
If you want to eat, you eat in the back.

1116
01:02:41,190 --> 01:02:43,055
Doughnuts!

1117
01:02:44,527 --> 01:02:46,188
You killin' me, D.
Come on, now.

1118
01:02:46,295 --> 01:02:49,287
If you change your mind and you
don't want any, they'll be in the back.

1119
01:02:49,398 --> 01:02:52,196
And I'll even restock
the shelves while I'm at it.

1120
01:02:55,972 --> 01:02:59,032
Joanne Marcus!
Terri, where'd you find her?

1121
01:02:59,142 --> 01:03:00,507
Look at you!

1122
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:02,908
Oh, why not? Everyone else is.

1123
01:03:03,579 --> 01:03:04,705
You grew.

1124
01:03:04,814 --> 01:03:06,111
Yes, I did.

1125
01:03:06,215 --> 01:03:08,979
Eight thousand a pop.
Had my nipples done, too.

1126
01:03:09,085 --> 01:03:10,052
You wanna feel them?

1127
01:03:10,153 --> 01:03:11,711
Maybe later.

1128
01:03:11,821 --> 01:03:14,187
I ran into Joanne
down at Saks and told her

1129
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:16,724
how wonderful your new place was
and dragged her down to see you.

1130
01:03:16,826 --> 01:03:18,987
And not a moment too soon.
Girl, what you doin' with that hair?

1131
01:03:19,095 --> 01:03:21,290
I know.
My hair misses you, Gina.

1132
01:03:21,397 --> 01:03:23,422
Well, your timin' is good.
My chair is open.

1133
01:03:24,967 --> 01:03:28,232
Girl! I got the same purse.

1134
01:03:28,337 --> 01:03:31,170
Did you get yours from Bernard
at the Piggly Wiggly in Decatur?

1135
01:03:31,274 --> 01:03:32,571
Piggly Wiggly?

1136
01:03:32,675 --> 01:03:34,609
Yeah. He sells thongs, too.

1137
01:03:38,314 --> 01:03:39,372
He works here?

1138
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:41,382
That he does.

1139
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:44,419
Gina, is that monkey-fish cat-bread lady
gonna be here today?

1140
01:03:55,765 --> 01:03:56,732
Bitch.

1141
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:05,769
So, if you had to take a wild guess,
how many grams of fat

1142
01:04:05,875 --> 01:04:08,002
would you say
are in a plate of your greens?

1143
01:04:08,110 --> 01:04:09,873
Baby, my greens is all fat.

1144
01:04:09,979 --> 01:04:12,948
Matter of fact, I found every fat
you could find to put in my greens.

1145
01:04:13,049 --> 01:04:16,280
I got fatback, salt pork,
Vienna sausage, ham slices,

1146
01:04:16,385 --> 01:04:19,513
pork chop, pork rinds,
and I got bacon bits in these greens.

1147
01:04:19,622 --> 01:04:20,987
- Talk dirty to me!
- That's right.

1148
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:22,557
Say it with me. "Fat is good."

1149
01:04:22,658 --> 01:04:25,286
- Fat is good.
- That's right. Sho nuff is!

1150
01:04:25,394 --> 01:04:28,454
- You should cater.
- Baby, franchise. Think big.

1151
01:04:28,564 --> 01:04:31,362
Please tell me you have some
of that magic potion hair stuff for me.

1152
01:04:31,467 --> 01:04:32,695
You know I do.

1153
01:04:33,636 --> 01:04:35,536
Some o' your magic what-what?

1154
01:04:35,638 --> 01:04:36,605
It's not no magic.

1155
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:39,072
It's just some conditioner
that I mix up in my kitchen. What?

1156
01:04:39,175 --> 01:04:42,440
Mix up in yo' kitchen?
What is it? Hair crack?

1157
01:04:44,146 --> 01:04:47,013
The stuff is great.
They should be sellin' it in stores!

1158
01:04:47,116 --> 01:04:49,311
They should.
They really should.

1159
01:04:49,418 --> 01:04:52,478
Gina, I know a few corporate vendors
on the beauty supply side.

1160
01:04:52,588 --> 01:04:54,613
They're always lookin'
for the next big thing.

1161
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:56,783
Well, hey, you know
I wanna be the next big thing.

1162
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:59,555
Well, float me a few bottles,
I'll see what I can do.

1163
01:04:59,662 --> 01:05:00,993
Girl, I will float you a damn case.

1164
01:05:01,097 --> 01:05:04,260
Why you holdin' out, Gina?
Hook us up with some o' your hair crack.

1165
01:05:04,367 --> 01:05:06,426
It is not hair crack. It's conditioner.

1166
01:05:06,535 --> 01:05:08,696
Yeah, Gina, hook us up!

1167
01:05:11,674 --> 01:05:13,437
Either you got a bee sting
of the breasts

1168
01:05:13,542 --> 01:05:16,340
or you got some serious work
done to your bosom area.

1169
01:05:16,445 --> 01:05:18,572
I sure did and I love 'em.

1170
01:05:18,681 --> 01:05:21,275
Well, for $8,000 a pop,
you better love 'em.

1171
01:05:21,384 --> 01:05:22,817
Hold up, Heidi.

1172
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:27,652
You paid 8,000
American dollars... per titty?

1173
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:29,418
Yes, I did.

1174
01:05:29,525 --> 01:05:32,221
Girl, you coulda bought
yourself a Saturn with that.

1175
01:05:32,328 --> 01:05:35,456
Now, you see all this right here,
all this ludicrousness goin' on here?

1176
01:05:35,564 --> 01:05:39,193
Okay, this implant, plastic surgery stuff?
It's more of a white girl thing.

1177
01:05:39,302 --> 01:05:42,294
No, Chanel.
Black girls get it done, too.

1178
01:05:42,405 --> 01:05:43,429
I'm not sayin' we don't.

1179
01:05:43,539 --> 01:05:46,440
I'm just sayin', you know,
we don't get all crazy like y'all do.

1180
01:05:46,542 --> 01:05:49,443
You know, injecting your asses
in your lips is just nasty.

1181
01:05:49,545 --> 01:05:50,534
Girl, who you tellin'?

1182
01:05:50,646 --> 01:05:54,047
Now, I may get a couple
o' unruly back or chest hairs plucked,

1183
01:05:54,150 --> 01:05:56,618
other than that,
I just be chillin'. I don't...

1184
01:06:00,856 --> 01:06:01,823
What?

1185
01:06:02,725 --> 01:06:06,126
So, what I'm saying is,
you know, some folks, you know,

1186
01:06:06,228 --> 01:06:10,528
have to pay to look good,
while other are just born that way.

1187
01:06:10,633 --> 01:06:11,998
It's the Motherland, baby.

1188
01:06:12,101 --> 01:06:14,092
Well, which way were you born,
ass-backwards?

1189
01:06:14,837 --> 01:06:17,635
Because statements
like that just personifies your ignorance

1190
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:20,334
as it pertains to the topic of beauty.

1191
01:06:24,146 --> 01:06:28,913
Excuse me? I know Botox Barbie
isn't tryin' to call me ignorant.

1192
01:06:29,018 --> 01:06:30,849
- I heard her say "your mama."
- Hey, calm down, hussies.

1193
01:06:30,953 --> 01:06:33,183
This ain't no remake
o' "Black Mama, White Mama"!

1194
01:06:33,289 --> 01:06:34,813
I throw the peace card on ya.

1195
01:06:34,924 --> 01:06:36,289
Thank you, Miss Josephine.

1196
01:06:36,392 --> 01:06:39,555
Come on, let's go get this hair done.
So you need to shampoo...

1197
01:06:48,304 --> 01:06:50,772
Does he ever leave that apartment?

1198
01:06:52,775 --> 01:06:54,538
That piano playin'
is gettin' on my nerves.

1199
01:06:55,378 --> 01:06:57,539
Which is why you
haven't patched up the ceiling yet.

1200
01:06:57,646 --> 01:07:01,673
Excuse you.
I've been busy, "mademoiselle."

1201
01:07:01,784 --> 01:07:04,776
Why don't you get your things together
so I can take you to church to practice?

1202
01:07:06,055 --> 01:07:08,216
Have you decided
what you wanna play for your recital yet?

1203
01:08:19,061 --> 01:08:20,358
Shoot.

1204
01:08:27,069 --> 01:08:32,564
I was just...
checkin' out your big... spear.

1205
01:08:33,242 --> 01:08:34,539
Sorry.

1206
01:08:36,312 --> 01:08:37,779
Would you like to join us?

1207
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:40,405
Can you show me the intervals again?

1208
01:08:40,516 --> 01:08:43,883
Well, each chord progression
is three steps apart.

1209
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:51,889
See? That's why
he called it "Giant Steps."

1210
01:08:51,994 --> 01:08:54,588
You won't hear anybody
playin' this at my recital.

1211
01:08:54,697 --> 01:08:58,360
- So what are you gonna play?
- I don't know.

1212
01:08:59,001 --> 01:09:01,629
- I'm all confused.
- What are you confused about?

1213
01:09:01,737 --> 01:09:03,068
Listen to your heart...

1214
01:09:05,174 --> 01:09:06,732
...and your fingers will follow.

1215
01:09:17,887 --> 01:09:21,516
So. This next song
goes out to all the finger-in-your-face.

1216
01:09:21,624 --> 01:09:23,717
Callin'- me- out -my- name heifers

1217
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:26,056
You can get all up
in my face if you want to.

1218
01:09:26,162 --> 01:09:27,527
But don't get it twisted. Baby.

1219
01:09:27,630 --> 01:09:28,722
'Cause guess what?

1220
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:36,327
Well, I'll take your man
right out the box

1221
01:09:36,438 --> 01:09:38,565
And put him
under my padlocks

1222
01:09:38,674 --> 01:09:41,074
So when you see us together
chillin' in the place

1223
01:09:41,177 --> 01:09:43,372
Cold walkin' and sportin' him
in your face

1224
01:09:43,479 --> 01:09:45,743
Go ahead, roll your eyes,
suck your teeth

1225
01:09:45,848 --> 01:09:48,146
Keep huffin' and puffin'
like a dog in heat

1226
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:50,411
You know whassup
I ain't no poo-putt

1227
01:09:50,519 --> 01:09:53,920
'Cause Pepa kicks butt off
young bucks like you

1228
01:09:54,023 --> 01:09:55,456
And the rest of your crew

1229
01:09:55,558 --> 01:09:57,753
If moms want static
I'll diss her, too

1230
01:09:57,860 --> 01:10:00,260
So scram,
you know who I am

1231
01:10:00,362 --> 01:10:01,954
Damn, chick,
don't play me close

1232
01:10:02,064 --> 01:10:03,122
'Cause I'll take your m...

1233
01:10:09,838 --> 01:10:12,136
You know, I was just...

1234
01:10:12,241 --> 01:10:13,503
Takin' someone's man?

1235
01:10:16,545 --> 01:10:18,706
I'll take your man

1236
01:10:18,814 --> 01:10:20,577
So I'm not playin'
any Beethoven or Mozart.

1237
01:10:20,683 --> 01:10:24,587
Too overdone.
I'm thinkin' Coltrane or Monk.

1238
01:10:24,587 --> 01:10:26,248
Too overdone.
I'm thinkin' Coltrane or Monk.

1239
01:10:26,355 --> 01:10:30,052
Then again, some Miles
or Stevie Wonder. Maybe some...

1240
01:10:30,159 --> 01:10:32,684
Girl, go and play
with your little friend, please.

1241
01:10:34,730 --> 01:10:35,754
Clown.

1242
01:10:35,864 --> 01:10:36,831
Yo, whassup, V?

1243
01:10:36,932 --> 01:10:39,400
- Still shootin' behinds, huh?
- Yup.

1244
01:10:39,501 --> 01:10:42,664
The booty is the cornerstone
of all hip-hop videos today.

1245
01:10:42,771 --> 01:10:44,671
If it ain't shakin', it ain't sellin'.

1246
01:10:44,773 --> 01:10:45,762
Whatever.

1247
01:10:45,874 --> 01:10:48,707
Are you down for some Krispy Kreme?
I got the hook-up.

1248
01:10:48,811 --> 01:10:50,506
My play cousin, Howard,
works over there.

1249
01:10:50,613 --> 01:10:53,810
He got shrimp doughnuts.
He got buffalo doughnuts...

1250
01:10:53,916 --> 01:10:56,817
He got... big booty doughnuts.

1251
01:10:56,919 --> 01:10:57,977
No, you didn't.

1252
01:10:58,087 --> 01:11:00,817
I don't eat doughnuts
with boys who exploit women.

1253
01:11:00,923 --> 01:11:01,981
Well, how about a burger, then?

1254
01:11:02,091 --> 01:11:05,356
I don't want any of your shrimp burgers
or your buffalo burgers.

1255
01:11:05,461 --> 01:11:08,362
So, you and your two play cousins
can get to steppin'!

1256
01:11:08,464 --> 01:11:10,455
See, that's why I like older women.

1257
01:11:12,801 --> 01:11:14,132
There's one o' your men.

1258
01:11:17,606 --> 01:11:20,336
- I'll be right back.
- That's what you always say.

1259
01:11:20,442 --> 01:11:22,171
I don't know if she's a ho or not.

1260
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:24,906
I ain't gon' say nothin'
'cause that's Gina's sister-in-law.

1261
01:11:28,450 --> 01:11:29,940
Hey, baby.

1262
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:33,484
- Are you happy to see me?
- Hey, baby.

1263
01:11:33,589 --> 01:11:36,649
- You're so sweet.
- Thank you.

1264
01:11:36,759 --> 01:11:38,454
This is how sweet you are.

1265
01:11:40,062 --> 01:11:42,553
Oh, my good... Is that for me?
Oh, baby.

1266
01:11:42,665 --> 01:11:45,759
You and only... you.

1267
01:11:46,602 --> 01:11:47,864
So here's the plan.
Let's get outta here.

1268
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:51,030
Go get a drink, listen to some music,
just chill out for the rest of the day.

1269
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:53,438
- How's that sound?
- Baby, it sounds so good.

1270
01:11:53,542 --> 01:11:56,511
I wish I could, but I gotta work.

1271
01:11:56,612 --> 01:11:58,637
Baby, don't work the whole day away.
I'll bring you back.

1272
01:11:58,747 --> 01:12:01,272
I know, but you know what?
I've really gotta work, 'cause Gin...

1273
01:12:01,383 --> 01:12:02,850
I'm tryin' to get close to you.

1274
01:12:02,951 --> 01:12:05,419
Gina needs me, okay, baby?
Thank you.

1275
01:12:05,521 --> 01:12:07,421
I don't give a damn about no Gina!

1276
01:12:08,123 --> 01:12:09,715
Don't you ever grab me up like that!

1277
01:12:09,825 --> 01:12:11,315
You know how much money
I just spent on you?

1278
01:12:11,427 --> 01:12:13,861
- What the hell?
- Gina, you all right?

1279
01:12:14,530 --> 01:12:15,827
What's this goin' on?

1280
01:12:16,432 --> 01:12:18,764
Shut your rantin' ass
and get in my car, you hear me?

1281
01:12:18,867 --> 01:12:20,300
- Hell, no!
- D, you all right?

1282
01:12:20,402 --> 01:12:22,666
I know I just didn't see you
put yo' hands on that girl.

1283
01:12:22,771 --> 01:12:23,897
Take your ass back in there,
do some heads.

1284
01:12:24,006 --> 01:12:25,496
Don't be tellin' me
where to take my ass.

1285
01:12:25,607 --> 01:12:27,131
You take your ass
from the front of my shop!

1286
01:12:27,242 --> 01:12:29,005
- Bitch, get out of my f...
- Bitch?

1287
01:12:29,111 --> 01:12:31,341
I will burn yo' ass
with this damn curlin' iron.

1288
01:12:31,447 --> 01:12:33,347
- Careful with that.
- You're crazy, you fake-ass Avon!

1289
01:12:33,449 --> 01:12:34,814
But you need to keep
your hands to yourself.

1290
01:12:34,917 --> 01:12:36,578
- I'll be back.
- Don't try to call me some type of bi...

1291
01:12:36,685 --> 01:12:38,277
- What you? What you?
- What?

1292
01:12:38,387 --> 01:12:39,718
When you gonna do
some hair? What you?

1293
01:12:39,822 --> 01:12:41,687
- I'll burn yo' ass.
- Hold on, hold on, hold on.

1294
01:12:41,790 --> 01:12:44,452
- We got a problem here?
- No, we ain't got no problem here, man.

1295
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:46,221
What you,
the mascot of the shop?

1296
01:12:46,328 --> 01:12:47,556
Take yo' foo-foo ass
back in there.

1297
01:12:47,663 --> 01:12:49,790
Go braid your eyebrows
or somethin', dawgs.

1298
01:12:50,866 --> 01:12:52,060
Check this out, dude.

1299
01:12:54,002 --> 01:12:55,833
Did you see that?

1300
01:12:57,206 --> 01:12:58,298
I hate violence.

1301
01:13:00,175 --> 01:13:01,301
See? That's what you get.

1302
01:13:01,410 --> 01:13:05,107
You come here talkin' all that stuff
and you got knocked out!

1303
01:13:05,214 --> 01:13:08,775
See, that's why you need to learn
how to respect women.

1304
01:13:08,884 --> 01:13:13,947
Now, see, Willie got it all on camera
and he sell 'em in the hood for 14.99!

1305
01:13:39,848 --> 01:13:42,612
Well, I'll be damned!

1306
01:13:44,119 --> 01:13:45,381
I'm gonna get him.

1307
01:13:48,791 --> 01:13:50,315
Remember me?

1308
01:13:51,427 --> 01:13:53,190
Oh, ja The shampooing girl.

1309
01:13:53,295 --> 01:13:55,354
So, how goes it
with the shampooing? Good?

1310
01:13:55,464 --> 01:14:00,299
The name is Lynn,
and I'm a stylist now, for your F.Y.I.

1311
01:14:00,402 --> 01:14:01,869
So?

1312
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:07,504
So... yup.

1313
01:14:09,211 --> 01:14:11,771
Well, well, well,
you must be lost or somethin'.

1314
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:14,371
Did you make a wrong turn
in your BMW?

1315
01:14:14,483 --> 01:14:17,509
No, actually, I took the "Yaguar,"
and it's good to see you, too, Gina.

1316
01:14:18,187 --> 01:14:19,279
He's in the "Yaguar."

1317
01:14:19,388 --> 01:14:21,413
Sorry, I thought
you were in the Beamer.

1318
01:14:21,523 --> 01:14:22,512
Anyway, what do you want?

1319
01:14:22,624 --> 01:14:24,114
Gina, I am Jorge.

1320
01:14:24,226 --> 01:14:26,820
I want for nothing.
I just came by to see the shop.

1321
01:14:26,929 --> 01:14:29,955
I was curious about the place
that's been stealing all of my best clients.

1322
01:14:30,065 --> 01:14:33,000
Now I see why.
It's very trendy.

1323
01:14:33,101 --> 01:14:35,661
Very SoHo-loftish.
I love it.

1324
01:14:35,771 --> 01:14:37,739
I guess I'm not doin' too bad,
you know,

1325
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:40,502
'specially for a woman
who should be fallin' flat on her ass.

1326
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:43,210
Ja. Well... about that,

1327
01:14:43,312 --> 01:14:46,281
you know, Gina, I want you to know
I'm truly sorry for my words.

1328
01:14:46,381 --> 01:14:48,246
I was speaking
from that angry place,

1329
01:14:48,350 --> 01:14:51,183
and I do not wish
to reside there anymore.

1330
01:14:51,286 --> 01:14:56,485
I mean, I wish no ill will
upon you or your shop or your peeps.

1331
01:14:56,592 --> 01:14:58,492
I mean, girlfriend,
you are doing it, ja?

1332
01:14:58,594 --> 01:14:59,686
Right?

1333
01:15:00,896 --> 01:15:04,627
It can't be easy, what with the overhead
and the paying of the fine

1334
01:15:04,733 --> 01:15:06,291
and the State Board coming by
at the worst times,

1335
01:15:06,401 --> 01:15:09,564
'cause believe me, baby, I've been there
and back to the other place.

1336
01:15:10,172 --> 01:15:11,196
And your point?

1337
01:15:11,306 --> 01:15:14,036
I just wanted to come by
to say that, you know,

1338
01:15:14,142 --> 01:15:18,841
if you ever need anything,
anything at all, lean on me.

1339
01:15:18,947 --> 01:15:22,212
When you're not strong,
I will be there, you know?

1340
01:15:22,317 --> 01:15:25,411
I mean, I am Jorge,
and there will always be

1341
01:15:25,521 --> 01:15:28,217
an open chair at Jorge's for Gina, ja?

1342
01:15:28,323 --> 01:15:31,417
Well, thanks, Jorge.
That means a lot comin' from you.

1343
01:15:31,527 --> 01:15:33,586
But I don't think
I'm gonna be needin' that.

1344
01:15:34,463 --> 01:15:38,991
Okay, well, fair enough.
Ciao Wiederseheh

1345
01:15:44,139 --> 01:15:49,600
Congratulations on the twins,
but I see that they are not identical.

1346
01:15:54,683 --> 01:15:57,652
- What the hell did he want?
- He came over to hate.

1347
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:00,454
He's just jealous.

1348
01:16:00,556 --> 01:16:04,617
- Who was that?
- That was the infamous Jorge.

1349
01:16:04,726 --> 01:16:05,784
Got some nice shoes, though.

1350
01:16:05,894 --> 01:16:07,225
You got some issues.

1351
01:16:07,329 --> 01:16:10,025
- Gina, who's your girl?
- You are.

1352
01:16:10,132 --> 01:16:13,431
Yes. And who, when asked
to make something happen,

1353
01:16:13,569 --> 01:16:14,900
is making something happen?

1354
01:16:15,003 --> 01:16:16,937
- You again?
- Correct.

1355
01:16:17,039 --> 01:16:19,269
And who was it
that talked up your conditioner

1356
01:16:19,374 --> 01:16:21,740
to the head of marketing
for CoverGirl's line of boutique products?

1357
01:16:21,843 --> 01:16:23,572
And why do they
want to meet with you?

1358
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:25,874
- Don't play with me. I can't take it.
- I'm serious.

1359
01:16:25,981 --> 01:16:28,245
They wanna meet with you,
fly you to New York, talk some business.

1360
01:16:28,350 --> 01:16:31,285
They wanna fly me
to New York? Me?!

1361
01:16:31,386 --> 01:16:32,478
Oh, my God!

1362
01:16:33,221 --> 01:16:35,189
- What?
- Thank you, Joanne!

1363
01:16:35,290 --> 01:16:37,417
- What's up?
- Oh, my God! Thank you!

1364
01:16:37,526 --> 01:16:39,357
Oh, my God!

1365
01:16:39,461 --> 01:16:42,988
CoverGirl
"CoverGirl" is interested in my conditioner.

1366
01:16:45,033 --> 01:16:46,000
I can't believe it!

1367
01:16:46,101 --> 01:16:48,695
- You talkin' about that hair crack?
- Yes, I'm talkin' about the ha...

1368
01:16:48,804 --> 01:16:51,272
They can call it whatever they want,
as long as they sell it.

1369
01:16:51,373 --> 01:16:53,637
You hear me?
I feel like I just won the lottery.

1370
01:16:53,742 --> 01:16:55,039
That's great, it's brilliant.

1371
01:16:55,143 --> 01:16:56,701
Why don't you feel
like takin' us out to celebrate?

1372
01:16:56,812 --> 01:16:58,677
- Oh, yeah, man.
- I think I can do that.

1373
01:16:58,780 --> 01:17:01,044
We got to toast on this somewhere.

1374
01:17:01,149 --> 01:17:04,778
I can't drink, but I sure can eat
Cosmopolitan cheesecake!

1375
01:17:07,322 --> 01:17:11,258
Tonight we goin' out and we celebratin'.
We are gettin' it on, we gettin' tipsy...

1376
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:13,794
Go on. Go sit your butt down.

1377
01:17:13,895 --> 01:17:17,558
We goin' out tonight! We partyin'!
Joanne, please.

1378
01:17:19,368 --> 01:17:21,097
- Hey, Joe.
- Hey, little one.

1379
01:17:21,203 --> 01:17:23,637
Guess what? CoverGirl
might buy my mom's conditioner.

1380
01:17:23,739 --> 01:17:26,503
So her and the girls
are goin' out tonight to celebrate.

1381
01:17:27,442 --> 01:17:30,707
Thought maybe you'd wanna come
and meet them there?

1382
01:17:31,446 --> 01:17:33,676
I'm not sure she wants me there.

1383
01:17:33,782 --> 01:17:37,081
But tell your mom I said congratulations.
That's great news.

1384
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:42,347
- Talk to you later.
- Keep practicing.

1385
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:00,364
Hey, baby.

1386
01:18:01,843 --> 01:18:03,504
- Look at that girl over there.
- For real.

1387
01:18:03,612 --> 01:18:07,139
Girl, if I wasn't married, pregnant,
and my feet didn't hurt,

1388
01:18:07,249 --> 01:18:10,013
I'd get with one
of these little chocolate kisses.

1389
01:18:10,118 --> 01:18:13,519
Yup. I can definitely see
why they call it Happy Hour!

1390
01:18:13,622 --> 01:18:16,591
Please, honey, Happy Hour
ended a long time ago.

1391
01:18:16,692 --> 01:18:19,422
- It is Get Crunked Hour, okay?
- All right.

1392
01:18:19,528 --> 01:18:22,019
Okay, ladies... and James,

1393
01:18:22,130 --> 01:18:25,361
I just want to say thank you so much
for hangin' in there with me, y'all.

1394
01:18:27,135 --> 01:18:29,069
You thought you wanted a Jorge's,

1395
01:18:29,171 --> 01:18:31,765
but you belong right here
in the 'hood with us.

1396
01:18:31,873 --> 01:18:34,137
- A'ight?
- Right. You ain't lyin'.

1397
01:18:34,242 --> 01:18:37,575
I ain't gonna front. When I met y'all
at Miss Angeline's that mornin',

1398
01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:39,306
I thought I was in for the worst.

1399
01:18:39,414 --> 01:18:41,245
- What?
- And that's what I got.

1400
01:18:41,349 --> 01:18:44,682
Until them two birds left the shop,
and then I had the best!

1401
01:18:44,786 --> 01:18:46,151
All right, we'll toast to that.

1402
01:18:47,089 --> 01:18:50,957
Ah, yes, yes, I do.

1403
01:18:51,059 --> 01:18:54,859
To Gina.
Sistah, you are an inspiration.

1404
01:18:54,963 --> 01:18:59,764
"Whether it's the arch o' your back
or the sun o' your smile,

1405
01:18:59,868 --> 01:19:04,601
"the ride o' your breasts
or the grace o' your style.

1406
01:19:04,706 --> 01:19:10,008
"You are and always will be
a woman phenomenally.

1407
01:19:10,112 --> 01:19:13,741
Phenomenal woman!"
That's you.

1408
01:19:13,849 --> 01:19:15,282
Yes, it is.

1409
01:19:16,318 --> 01:19:18,684
Congratulations, Gina.
Would you like to dance?

1410
01:19:18,787 --> 01:19:20,254
What are you doing here?

1411
01:19:20,355 --> 01:19:22,448
Asking you to dance.

1412
01:19:22,557 --> 01:19:25,355
Now, please, say yes so it can look
like I have a little bit of game.

1413
01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:27,951
- Okay.
- Oh, my God, girl!

1414
01:19:30,031 --> 01:19:34,229
- I wanna get tribal with y'all.
- That was like 1989.

1415
01:19:34,336 --> 01:19:36,770
Okay, hand me the scissor.

1416
01:19:40,475 --> 01:19:41,499
So, Lynn...

1417
01:19:43,078 --> 01:19:44,204
You wanna move a little somethin'?

1418
01:19:45,147 --> 01:19:46,114
Move what?

1419
01:19:46,214 --> 01:19:48,011
He askin' you to dance, crazy girl.

1420
01:19:49,217 --> 01:19:52,550
I thought he wanted me
to move some chairs or somethin'!

1421
01:19:54,923 --> 01:19:58,484
- Sure.
- All right, go have fun.

1422
01:19:58,593 --> 01:20:00,823
- Go ahead.
- Go on, now.

1423
01:20:00,929 --> 01:20:03,261
Her gonna need
some scissor, for real.

1424
01:20:03,365 --> 01:20:06,198
Did you see that?
Did you see that?

1425
01:20:06,301 --> 01:20:09,600
All these beautiful black girls
and he goes straight for the white girl.

1426
01:20:09,704 --> 01:20:12,138
I'm tellin' you, MTV is the devil.

1427
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:14,606
Girl, what is wrong with you?
Okay, who gives a damn?

1428
01:20:14,709 --> 01:20:16,836
The boy is gayer than Peter Pan
on a pair o' ice skates.

1429
01:20:28,523 --> 01:20:29,751
Okay, you know what?

1430
01:20:46,374 --> 01:20:48,137
- She dropped it like it's hot!
- Oh, damn!

1431
01:21:02,057 --> 01:21:05,823
- I think we're bein' outdone.
- What? You think?

1432
01:21:14,302 --> 01:21:16,930
- What?!
- James is gay, all right.

1433
01:21:17,038 --> 01:21:18,801
He happier than hell!

1434
01:21:23,011 --> 01:21:24,308
- Girls...
- Yeah, let's go.

1435
01:21:24,412 --> 01:21:26,471
- I see somethin' I need. Come on, now.
- I'ma show her how you really do that.

1436
01:21:26,581 --> 01:21:27,639
Come on.

1437
01:21:37,092 --> 01:21:39,652
This goes out to my girl Gina

1438
01:21:39,761 --> 01:21:43,720
Some old school
Chicago steppin' music. Girl

1439
01:21:47,636 --> 01:21:48,898
- That's my song.
- Come on.

1440
01:22:22,771 --> 01:22:23,965
Is this your family?

1441
01:22:25,373 --> 01:22:28,433
My happily married sister
and her two kids.

1442
01:22:28,543 --> 01:22:29,805
They live in France.

1443
01:22:29,911 --> 01:22:32,277
Well, what about a wife and kids?

1444
01:22:34,115 --> 01:22:35,605
That never happen for you?

1445
01:22:38,253 --> 01:22:40,517
Many things
never happened for me.

1446
01:22:51,166 --> 01:22:52,724
And many things have.

1447
01:23:02,110 --> 01:23:04,374
I don't think I'm really...

1448
01:23:24,232 --> 01:23:26,757
You just played
the most beautiful chord ever.

1449
01:23:56,931 --> 01:23:59,161
- Pass the ball!
- Oh, really?

1450
01:24:03,238 --> 01:24:04,762
Come on, man, pass the ball!

1451
01:24:20,522 --> 01:24:23,013
Gotta make sure you arrive safely.

1452
01:24:27,062 --> 01:24:30,259
Oh, my goodness.
That's it.

1453
01:24:31,666 --> 01:24:34,066
A case of my future
is on its way to CoverGirl

1454
01:24:34,169 --> 01:24:37,104
Okay, now, listen. If they call you
and they need some more...

1455
01:24:37,205 --> 01:24:39,070
No, Gina. This is more than enough.

1456
01:24:39,340 --> 01:24:41,604
- Let's not get frantic, okay?
- Okay.

1457
01:24:44,779 --> 01:24:46,644
Come on, stop doin' that.

1458
01:24:47,849 --> 01:24:51,512
Could you carry this to my car for me?
It's just outside.

1459
01:24:51,619 --> 01:24:54,486
- Yeah, I'll take it.
- Thanks.

1460
01:24:57,992 --> 01:24:59,323
Firm.

1461
01:25:04,065 --> 01:25:05,828
Excuse me, Joanne.

1462
01:25:06,634 --> 01:25:08,829
Would you mind
not doing that anymore?

1463
01:25:08,937 --> 01:25:09,995
Doing what?

1464
01:25:10,105 --> 01:25:13,006
You know, the whole
smacking-on-the-butt thing.

1465
01:25:13,108 --> 01:25:16,737
James and I are kinda,
you know, hanging out now.

1466
01:25:16,845 --> 01:25:18,745
I didn't know you guys were...

1467
01:25:18,847 --> 01:25:20,041
Yes, we are.

1468
01:25:20,148 --> 01:25:21,809
So, you understand.

1469
01:25:21,916 --> 01:25:23,406
Yeah, I understand...

1470
01:25:24,953 --> 01:25:26,682
...that you're afraid
of a little competition.

1471
01:25:28,723 --> 01:25:31,317
What's the matter, Lynn?
You afraid James might grow tired

1472
01:25:31,426 --> 01:25:35,863
of your wannabe-black girl routine
and fall for somethin' real, like me?

1473
01:25:36,698 --> 01:25:38,029
Real?

1474
01:25:38,133 --> 01:25:40,795
Since when are two air bags
for breasts real, Joanne?

1475
01:25:40,902 --> 01:25:42,767
Maybe on my daddy's Chevy
they's real,

1476
01:25:42,871 --> 01:25:45,203
but on you,
they's just... ridiculous.

1477
01:25:47,475 --> 01:25:48,499
Excuse me?

1478
01:25:48,610 --> 01:25:49,872
You heard me.

1479
01:25:49,978 --> 01:25:51,468
Yeah, but I think I shouldn't have.

1480
01:25:51,579 --> 01:25:52,603
Yeah, but you did.

1481
01:25:52,714 --> 01:25:55,512
And I think what my girl
is sayin' is that she wants you

1482
01:25:55,617 --> 01:25:57,983
and your tetherball titties
to leave her man alone, all right?

1483
01:25:58,086 --> 01:26:01,852
Okay, Little Miss Hip-Hop,
I think I was speaking to Lynn.

1484
01:26:01,956 --> 01:26:03,890
White girl gone crazy.

1485
01:26:03,992 --> 01:26:06,517
What did you say to me?
Little Miss Hip-Hop?

1486
01:26:06,628 --> 01:26:09,290
- I will hip-hop my foot up...
- She threatened me.

1487
01:26:09,397 --> 01:26:12,423
- Did you hear that, Gina?
- Yeah, I heard all y'all.

1488
01:26:12,534 --> 01:26:15,128
I'm the client.
She should be fired. Right now!

1489
01:26:15,803 --> 01:26:18,363
Joanne, calm down.
You know how we clown around here.

1490
01:26:18,473 --> 01:26:21,101
Now, look, y'all are grown women.
Y'all can work this out.

1491
01:26:21,209 --> 01:26:22,403
So you're not gonna fire her?

1492
01:26:22,510 --> 01:26:23,943
No.

1493
01:26:29,083 --> 01:26:31,711
Okay, fine. Yeah.

1494
01:26:31,819 --> 01:26:33,844
I see how things work around here.

1495
01:26:33,955 --> 01:26:36,981
You know what? You can forget
about your meeting with CoverGirl

1496
01:26:37,091 --> 01:26:39,059
And you can forget
about me as a client.

1497
01:26:39,160 --> 01:26:40,286
How's that?

1498
01:26:45,667 --> 01:26:48,966
- Fine.
- I'm so sorry, Gina.

1499
01:26:49,070 --> 01:26:51,595
No. Ain't nothin'
to be sorry about.

1500
01:26:51,706 --> 01:26:53,674
I guess
it just wasn't meant to be.

1501
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:13,288
What's going on?

1502
01:27:15,263 --> 01:27:16,992
There's a problem at the shop.

1503
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:55,763
I still have men checking the area.
I'll let you know if we find something.

1504
01:27:57,038 --> 01:27:58,505
Thanks.

1505
01:28:14,289 --> 01:28:17,622
You try doin' your own thing,
and then somethin' like this happens.

1506
01:28:18,826 --> 01:28:22,922
Sorry, Gina.
I'm so sorry this happened to you.

1507
01:28:25,900 --> 01:28:28,801
I can't catch a break. I just...

1508
01:28:35,843 --> 01:28:38,311
I have Vanessa's recital tomorrow,

1509
01:28:38,413 --> 01:28:42,042
and I have to go up in there
with all o' this on my brain.

1510
01:28:42,150 --> 01:28:45,745
It's okay, Gina.
You'll get through this.

1511
01:28:47,522 --> 01:28:51,788
- You'll get through this.
- I wish that was true, Joe.

1512
01:28:51,893 --> 01:28:52,985
You will.

1513
01:28:57,899 --> 01:28:59,230
It's okay.

1514
01:28:59,334 --> 01:29:03,964
No. I can't...
I can't fix this one. I can't.

1515
01:29:10,678 --> 01:29:16,173
And now, coming to the stage
for a piano solo... Vanessa Norris.

1516
01:29:53,454 --> 01:29:56,446
Play from your heart.

1517
01:30:22,683 --> 01:30:25,846
Go, baby. That's my baby girl.

1518
01:30:27,455 --> 01:30:28,820
Everything's gonna be all right.

1519
01:30:28,923 --> 01:30:30,982
- I love you, Mom.
- I love you, too.

1520
01:31:01,856 --> 01:31:04,723
That's my baby! That's my baby!

1521
01:31:13,968 --> 01:31:15,936
Mom, how'd I do?

1522
01:31:17,104 --> 01:31:18,731
You were everything
I ever imagined.

1523
01:31:24,278 --> 01:31:26,678
Mom... you okay?

1524
01:31:26,781 --> 01:31:28,749
Yeah. I'm fine.

1525
01:31:28,850 --> 01:31:30,283
I'm just happy.

1526
01:31:30,384 --> 01:31:32,352
Come here.

1527
01:31:32,453 --> 01:31:34,216
Fly me some fingers, girl.

1528
01:31:35,056 --> 01:31:36,250
Let's get outta here.

1529
01:32:18,032 --> 01:32:20,432
Surprise!

1530
01:32:21,736 --> 01:32:24,000
What? What... what the...

1531
01:32:24,672 --> 01:32:27,266
Y'all, I don't know what to say.
This is...

1532
01:32:27,375 --> 01:32:28,774
This is crazy.

1533
01:32:28,876 --> 01:32:32,107
No. This is Gina's House of...

1534
01:32:32,213 --> 01:32:35,376
House of... Okay, maybe
it's just Gina's House, okay?

1535
01:32:38,252 --> 01:32:39,981
Check that out. Oh, yeah!

1536
01:32:41,756 --> 01:32:45,021
D, that's what I'm talkin' about, girl!

1537
01:32:45,126 --> 01:32:46,923
Oh, man, y'all...

1538
01:32:48,029 --> 01:32:49,724
This is nice.

1539
01:32:50,765 --> 01:32:51,823
It is.

1540
01:32:54,001 --> 01:32:55,468
But I don't think we can do this.

1541
01:32:55,570 --> 01:32:57,162
Why not?

1542
01:32:57,271 --> 01:33:01,139
We brought blow dryers
and curlin' irons and hot c...

1543
01:33:01,242 --> 01:33:03,642
A new picture
of Madam C.J. Walker.

1544
01:33:03,744 --> 01:33:09,114
- Money. Did you bring any o' that?
- The point is, Gina, we're here.

1545
01:33:09,216 --> 01:33:12,208
The shop's here!
We're with you.

1546
01:33:13,054 --> 01:33:17,821
Lord! It is hotter
than a jalapeno's coochie out there!

1547
01:33:18,526 --> 01:33:20,016
Thank God y'all open.

1548
01:33:20,127 --> 01:33:24,359
Child, I done been to five shops in four
blocks and all them bitches is booked.

1549
01:33:24,465 --> 01:33:26,797
And I got a weddin'
to get to in three hours!

1550
01:33:26,901 --> 01:33:30,496
Lord, please, can somebody
do me? Please?

1551
01:33:30,605 --> 01:33:32,596
Anybody, please.

1552
01:33:36,677 --> 01:33:38,508
Yeah, sure. I'll hook you up, girl.

1553
01:33:38,613 --> 01:33:40,410
Let me see
what we workin' with under this hat.

1554
01:33:41,248 --> 01:33:43,079
- Damn!
- Oh, my God!

1555
01:33:43,184 --> 01:33:44,651
- Hear me, Lord!
- God!

1556
01:33:44,752 --> 01:33:47,619
I'm havin'
some Don King issues, damn it.

1557
01:33:49,457 --> 01:33:53,154
- Just one o' you heifers do me, please!
- Okay, okay.

1558
01:33:53,260 --> 01:33:54,727
You know what?
I can work with this.

1559
01:33:54,829 --> 01:33:56,729
- Don't even worry about it.
- Thank you.

1560
01:33:57,465 --> 01:34:00,992
Darnelle, get her shampooed
and use a bottle of my conditioner.

1561
01:34:01,102 --> 01:34:03,468
No! Make that two bottles.

1562
01:34:03,571 --> 01:34:06,972
And... James, get that percolator
percolatin', baby.

1563
01:34:07,074 --> 01:34:09,599
We back in business!
Shoot!

1564
01:34:09,710 --> 01:34:11,575
And, everybody else...

1565
01:34:13,914 --> 01:34:15,142
Thank you.

1566
01:34:15,249 --> 01:34:17,615
- Gina, we love you.
- Thank you, thank you.

1567
01:34:17,718 --> 01:34:19,982
That's right, girl,
we open for business.

1568
01:34:21,322 --> 01:34:22,846
- What happened here?
- Good morning.

1569
01:34:22,957 --> 01:34:25,448
Hey, well, put it like this.
Not enough to make us quit.

1570
01:34:25,559 --> 01:34:27,322
- How you doin', girl?
- Fine.

1571
01:34:27,428 --> 01:34:29,521
I'm terrific, actually,
now that Steven and I split up.

1572
01:34:29,630 --> 01:34:31,723
- You all right?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

1573
01:34:31,832 --> 01:34:35,962
Hell, y'all all knew he was cheatin' on me.
Now I know and now I'm free.

1574
01:34:36,070 --> 01:34:39,335
Well, good for you.
Hey, Ida, why don't you hook Terri up?

1575
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:42,136
- Oh, good. Hi.
- Come on, girl.

1576
01:34:42,243 --> 01:34:44,473
You want me to sic
my cousin Travis on him?

1577
01:34:44,578 --> 01:34:47,046
He just got out the pen,
but he don't mind goin' back early.

1578
01:34:47,148 --> 01:34:49,639
- I just might take you up on that.
- All right, come on, sit down.

1579
01:34:49,750 --> 01:34:53,413
Oh, shoot! Look
what the collard greens did to her booty!

1580
01:34:54,121 --> 01:34:56,453
- Go girl!
- Back that thing up, girl!

1581
01:34:56,557 --> 01:34:57,819
Where'd you get that?

1582
01:34:58,626 --> 01:35:01,493
That is a ass, Terri.
You have a ass, girl!

1583
01:35:04,398 --> 01:35:05,797
- Hi, Gina.
- Hi, honey.

1584
01:35:05,900 --> 01:35:07,367
- For me?
- Something to brighten your day?

1585
01:35:07,468 --> 01:35:09,561
Thank you.

1586
01:35:11,305 --> 01:35:14,001
But you brightened my day
as soon as you came through that door.

1587
01:35:14,709 --> 01:35:16,643
- Excuse me.
- What a transformation.

1588
01:35:16,744 --> 01:35:18,769
Yeah. They hooked me up.

1589
01:35:20,114 --> 01:35:22,082
Looks like you're
stickin' around, Miss Norris.

1590
01:35:22,183 --> 01:35:24,617
- Yeah, I guess I am, huh?
- Yes.

1591
01:35:25,686 --> 01:35:29,315
No, it ain't goin' down like that.
How you doin', Miss Gina?

1592
01:35:29,423 --> 01:35:31,983
- Hey, Willie. What's up wit' you?
- I'm a'ight.

1593
01:35:32,093 --> 01:35:33,685
What, you feelin' froggy? Jump!

1594
01:35:35,162 --> 01:35:36,754
What is this?

1595
01:35:44,538 --> 01:35:48,406
Stacy? Yeah. Hi, baby.
How ya doin'? This is me.

1596
01:35:48,509 --> 01:35:51,876
No, I'm just closing up,
so I'll meet you at the spa, ja?

1597
01:35:57,818 --> 01:35:58,944
I call you back.

1598
01:36:21,242 --> 01:36:22,641
- What a...
- Surprise.

1599
01:36:24,445 --> 01:36:27,642
I bet you I'm the last person on earth
you expected to see in here, huh?

1600
01:36:27,748 --> 01:36:29,978
No. In fact,
I knew you would be back.

1601
01:36:30,885 --> 01:36:34,343
Well, I'm afraid I don't have time
for such a sudden intrusion.

1602
01:36:34,455 --> 01:36:36,320
I have a prior engagement.

1603
01:36:36,423 --> 01:36:40,120
Sorry. I didn't mean to intrude.
What kind o' engagement?

1604
01:36:40,227 --> 01:36:42,821
What, you goin' to meet up
with Inspector Crawford

1605
01:36:42,930 --> 01:36:44,989
and figure out how you
can burn my place down this time?

1606
01:36:45,099 --> 01:36:49,593
Gina, I just love it when you
let that imagination of yours run wild.

1607
01:36:49,703 --> 01:36:50,897
It's so street.

1608
01:36:51,872 --> 01:36:54,067
You haven't even begun
to see the street.

1609
01:36:54,175 --> 01:36:56,370
You know, I knew you
had somethin' to do with it.

1610
01:36:56,477 --> 01:37:00,470
You know, comin' by my salon, talkin'
'bout how hard it is to own a business,

1611
01:37:00,581 --> 01:37:03,516
what with the payin' o' fines
and the State Board comin' by.

1612
01:37:04,418 --> 01:37:08,115
And I asked myself,
"Why would he say somethin' like that?"

1613
01:37:10,057 --> 01:37:12,890
Look at me.
Look to Jorge.

1614
01:37:12,993 --> 01:37:14,551
Do I seem
like the type of person

1615
01:37:14,662 --> 01:37:17,529
that would reside
in such deviant behavior, huh?

1616
01:37:20,334 --> 01:37:22,359
With those split ends?
Yeah, you kinda do.

1617
01:37:22,469 --> 01:37:26,200
- What is this?
- That is "World's Dumbest Criminals."

1618
01:37:26,307 --> 01:37:28,138
Starrin' you and Inspector Crawford.

1619
01:37:28,709 --> 01:37:32,338
You should be a little more secretive
about the way you do dirt.

1620
01:37:32,446 --> 01:37:35,040
So... George Christie...

1621
01:37:35,883 --> 01:37:39,375
...of Austria, via Nebraska.

1622
01:37:39,486 --> 01:37:41,613
Yeah, I know about you.
I know your secret.

1623
01:37:42,857 --> 01:37:43,915
The point is this.

1624
01:37:45,125 --> 01:37:48,617
You didn't break me.
I'm still standin'.

1625
01:37:48,729 --> 01:37:52,859
And my shop is open
and doin' very good business.

1626
01:37:52,967 --> 01:37:57,529
And you will never,
ever intimidate me,

1627
01:37:57,638 --> 01:37:59,299
'cause I'm a phenomenal woman.

1628
01:37:59,406 --> 01:38:03,274
Kinda like what you try to be
but don't really pull off.

1629
01:38:06,580 --> 01:38:10,539
Have a nice ride back
to that rib shack you call a shop!

1630
01:38:10,651 --> 01:38:13,643
Don't cut yourself
on the broken glass, bitch!

1631
01:38:14,555 --> 01:38:15,749
Did somebody say "Cut"?

1632
01:38:16,490 --> 01:38:18,424
What? Was ist das?
What?!

1633
01:38:20,527 --> 01:38:23,690
- Sit up, man.
- No! No! Shit!

1634
01:38:29,169 --> 01:38:32,104
Hotlanta! Whassup?

1635
01:38:32,206 --> 01:38:33,605
Once again, it's your girl Helen,

1636
01:38:33,707 --> 01:38:37,609
hollerin' at ya this mornin'.
Tellin' ya to get your ass up.

1637
01:38:37,711 --> 01:38:39,269
'cause it is a lovely day

1638
01:38:41,682 --> 01:38:44,276
It's good, right?
It always is.

1639
01:38:44,385 --> 01:38:45,977
Gina, telephone.

1640
01:38:47,521 --> 01:38:49,113
Hello. Gina Norris.

1641
01:38:49,223 --> 01:38:52,056
- Hey. Gina. It's hollerin' Helen
- Shut up.

1642
01:38:52,159 --> 01:38:55,560
You lyin'.
Turn the radio up, turn it up.

1643
01:38:58,565 --> 01:39:01,466
Gina. Y'all doin'
the damn thing down there!

1644
01:39:01,568 --> 01:39:03,365
I'm on the radio!
I'm on the radio!

1645
01:39:05,039 --> 01:39:07,940
Ask her if she'd give a shout out to my kid,
Venus Serena Marion Jones, Junior!

1646
01:39:08,042 --> 01:39:09,373
Shout out to Africa!

1647
01:39:09,476 --> 01:39:11,910
Gina, I just called
to say thanks again

1648
01:39:12,012 --> 01:39:15,971
for hookin' my head up for my cousin
Shondrella's weddin' a couple o' days ago.

1649
01:39:16,083 --> 01:39:18,210
Girl, you saved my life!

1650
01:39:18,919 --> 01:39:20,978
That hair crack conditioner of yours

1651
01:39:21,088 --> 01:39:23,613
got me lookin'
all Halle Berry-ish and thangs

1652
01:39:23,724 --> 01:39:26,852
- Don King? That was you?
- Sure was

1653
01:39:26,961 --> 01:39:29,361
and I'ma need me
a touch-up in a minute

1654
01:39:29,463 --> 01:39:32,557
My man came over last night
and kinda sweated out my flip!

1655
01:39:32,666 --> 01:39:35,567
Now, see, that's what got you
in trouble the last time.

1656
01:39:35,669 --> 01:39:38,160
Hotlanta, if you want
to get your crop dusted,

1657
01:39:38,272 --> 01:39:40,331
your do did, or your flip whipped,

1658
01:39:40,441 --> 01:39:42,102
jump yo' butt in the hoopty,

1659
01:39:42,209 --> 01:39:44,803
get on down
to Gina's Hair Salon in the SWATS

1660
01:39:44,912 --> 01:39:49,008
and let 'em hook you up with some
of Gina's famous hair crack conditioner.

1661
01:39:50,317 --> 01:39:52,342
Now, since y'all my peeps,

1662
01:39:52,453 --> 01:39:55,786
I'ma let you ladies in the shop
pick Helen's topic for the day.

1663
01:39:55,889 --> 01:39:57,356
Holler at me, ladies.

1664
01:39:57,458 --> 01:39:59,085
I'll holler!

1665
01:40:00,627 --> 01:40:03,323
Talk about how come there's never
a black man as The Bachelor. Okay?

1666
01:40:03,430 --> 01:40:05,022
The revolution needs to be televised.

1667
01:40:05,132 --> 01:40:07,225
You know what? I think you should talk
about people who name their kids

1668
01:40:07,334 --> 01:40:09,029
names that they
ain't never gon' live up to,

1669
01:40:09,136 --> 01:40:11,331
like a Porsche
that look like a Buick

1670
01:40:11,438 --> 01:40:14,430
and a Mercedes
that look like a doggone Pinto!

1671
01:40:14,541 --> 01:40:16,873
Talk about these athletes
goin' to jail these days.

1672
01:40:16,977 --> 01:40:19,411
They spend more time in the court
than on the court.

1673
01:40:19,513 --> 01:40:22,448
Keep this up,
halftime gon' be a plea bargain.

1674
01:40:23,650 --> 01:40:26,483
No, talk about interracial love.

1675
01:40:26,587 --> 01:40:27,679
You know you black.

1676
01:40:27,788 --> 01:40:32,885
No, let's talk about legalizin' marijuana,
'cause my glaucoma's gettin' bad now.

1677
01:40:32,993 --> 01:40:34,255
Talk about how
if you have sex with a man,

1678
01:40:34,361 --> 01:40:35,760
he put you out
before he give you breakfast.

1679
01:40:35,863 --> 01:40:39,424
After some good lovin', I like to go
cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs for damn sho'!

1680
01:40:40,300 --> 01:40:41,597
Watch it, y'all

1681
01:40:41,702 --> 01:40:45,536
Big ups to you, Gina.
I'll be callin' you in a minute for a touch-up.

1682
01:40:45,639 --> 01:40:47,903
Y'all keep holdin' it down.
I'll holler.

1683
01:40:48,008 --> 01:40:50,340
Holler!

1684
01:40:51,340 --> 01:41:01,340
