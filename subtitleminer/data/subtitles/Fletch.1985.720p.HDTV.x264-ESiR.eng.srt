My name is Erwin Fletcher.

26
00:02:03,267 --> 00:02:05,735
I'm an investigative reporter
for a Los Angeles paper.

27
00:02:05,803 --> 00:02:08,796
You've probably read my stuff
under the byline of Jane Doe.

28
00:02:08,874 --> 00:02:11,240
Is better than Erwin.

29
00:02:11,309 --> 00:02:14,301
Recently I've been
loitering around the beach...

30
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:17,679
trying to pass for
a minor league junkie.

31
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,275
I don't nod out or drool;
thas too obvious.

32
00:02:20,353 --> 00:02:22,948
Act like you don't care
and you fit right in.

33
00:02:23,023 --> 00:02:25,787
[Whistles]
Business has really picked up.

34
00:02:25,859 --> 00:02:27,292
I'm still closed.

35
00:02:27,361 --> 00:02:29,352
Is it a Colombian national holiday?

36
00:02:34,202 --> 00:02:35,863
What do you figure, Sam?

37
00:02:35,937 --> 00:02:37,632
No idea.

38
00:02:37,705 --> 00:02:40,504
- No idea at all?
- Some idea.

39
00:02:40,576 --> 00:02:41,907
Like when?

40
00:02:41,977 --> 00:02:44,036
When it comes, it comes.

41
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,438
I got some reds.

42
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:49,408
You don't mean communists,
do you?

43
00:02:49,486 --> 00:02:51,977
Is everything a joke
to you, Fletch?

44
00:02:52,055 --> 00:02:53,579
Everything, Sam.

45
00:02:55,892 --> 00:02:58,657
- Hey, Gummy!
- Hey, Fletch. Hey, Sam.

46
00:02:58,729 --> 00:03:00,356
How's the eye?

47
00:03:00,431 --> 00:03:02,456
Is OK.
The cops did it.

48
00:03:02,533 --> 00:03:04,593
They always
beating up on me.

49
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:26,683
- He doesn't know.
- Son of a bitch!

50
00:03:28,329 --> 00:03:30,389
Thas what he said.

51
00:03:30,465 --> 00:03:33,957
He doesn't know?
How come he doesn't know?

52
00:03:34,035 --> 00:03:36,265
I don't know.
He just doesn't know.

53
00:03:36,338 --> 00:03:38,398
Son of a bitch!

54
00:03:39,675 --> 00:03:41,666
I wonder how he
gets the stuff.

55
00:03:41,744 --> 00:03:43,371
I have no idea.

56
00:03:43,446 --> 00:03:45,573
Sam never leaves the beach.

57
00:03:45,648 --> 00:03:48,982
He sits in that chair.
He's out of shit.

58
00:03:49,052 --> 00:03:51,953
Suddenly he gets up,
he's got shit.

59
00:03:52,022 --> 00:03:54,821
Where's it coming from?
The sand?

60
00:03:55,827 --> 00:03:57,886
Thas highly unlikely, Grease.

61
00:03:59,097 --> 00:04:01,258
I oughta get some sleep.

62
00:04:05,004 --> 00:04:07,063
Grease, how old are you?

63
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:08,504
Nineteen.

64
00:04:09,808 --> 00:04:12,369
You're not taking
very good care of yourself.

65
00:04:20,188 --> 00:04:24,522
[Fletch]
If you haven't guessed, there's been
a lot of drug traffic on the beach.

66
00:04:24,592 --> 00:04:26,822
I'm not talking about No-Doze.

67
00:04:26,894 --> 00:04:30,092
I talkin' about the hard stuff.
A lot of it.

68
00:04:31,133 --> 00:04:34,125
I've been trying to find out
who's behind it.

69
00:04:34,203 --> 00:04:36,229
It hasn't been easy.

70
00:04:36,306 --> 00:04:38,297
I don't shower much.

71
00:04:46,884 --> 00:04:50,581
Excuse me. I have something
I'd like to discuss with you.

72
00:04:50,654 --> 00:04:53,647
- Whas that?
- We can't talk about it here.

73
00:04:53,725 --> 00:04:56,785
- Why not?
- Because we can't.

74
00:04:57,963 --> 00:05:02,298
You on a scavenger hunt, or did I
forget to pay my dinner check?

75
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:04,802
Come to my house
to talk.

76
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,394
Wrong gal, fella.

77
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:08,497
I'll give you
$1,000 cash.

78
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,004
What?

79
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:15,137
Come to my house
and listen to the proposition.

80
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:20,746
If you reject the proposition,
you keep the thousand...

81
00:05:21,589 --> 00:05:23,079
and your mouth shut.

82
00:05:27,196 --> 00:05:30,188
Does this entail
my dressing up as Little Bo Peep?

83
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,098
- Is nothing of a sexual nature.
- Yeah.

84
00:05:35,171 --> 00:05:37,264
One thousand just to listen?

85
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,934
How can you pass that up,
Mister...

86
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:43,037
Nugent. Ted Nugent.

87
00:05:44,115 --> 00:05:45,514
Alan Stanwyk.

88
00:05:46,584 --> 00:05:48,074
Alan, charmed.

89
00:05:50,054 --> 00:05:53,547
For an extra grand, I'll let you
take me out to dinner.

90
00:06:15,115 --> 00:06:16,845
What a coincidence.

91
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,818
What?

92
00:06:18,887 --> 00:06:21,583
I almost bought
this place.

93
00:06:21,656 --> 00:06:24,591
Then I found out Hopalong Cassidy
killed himself here. Blew it for me.

94
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,753
- Who?
- Hopalong Cassidy.

95
00:06:26,829 --> 00:06:29,593
Bow and arrow.
Very weird.

96
00:06:29,665 --> 00:06:31,496
Are you doped up?

97
00:06:31,567 --> 00:06:34,560
Don't talk to me like that.
I don't work for you.

98
00:06:39,409 --> 00:06:41,172
- Buenos días.
- Buenos días.

99
00:06:41,244 --> 00:06:42,234
Pup 'N' Taco.

100
00:06:43,781 --> 00:06:46,306
Oh, you've remodeled
the garage.

101
00:06:46,384 --> 00:06:48,443
Must have
cost you hundreds.

102
00:06:51,223 --> 00:06:53,350
Good idea.
I oughta frame mine.

103
00:06:54,193 --> 00:06:56,184
Will the Pope
be in later?

104
00:07:13,013 --> 00:07:14,503
Here's my proposition.

105
00:07:14,582 --> 00:07:16,107
I'm all ears.

106
00:07:16,184 --> 00:07:18,118
I want you
to murder me.

107
00:07:22,057 --> 00:07:23,389
Here...

108
00:07:23,459 --> 00:07:24,926
on Thursday.

109
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:28,186
I'd like you
to shoot me dead.

110
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:36,366
The reason
I ask for this service...

111
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,068
is because I'm already facing
a very long...

112
00:07:39,143 --> 00:07:42,636
painful and most certain death.

113
00:07:42,747 --> 00:07:45,716
You see, I have bone cancer.

114
00:07:45,784 --> 00:07:49,881
I don't know if you
know about bone cancer.

115
00:07:49,955 --> 00:07:52,048
Is the worst kind you can get.

116
00:07:52,124 --> 00:07:55,150
It just eats you up
bit by bit.

117
00:08:00,634 --> 00:08:02,659
You don't look sick.

118
00:08:02,769 --> 00:08:05,034
I don't feel sick. Not yet.

119
00:08:05,106 --> 00:08:07,666
Ill get bad
in a month.

120
00:08:07,742 --> 00:08:10,768
After that, I'd rather
not be around for it.

121
00:08:12,313 --> 00:08:13,906
Why not try suicide?

122
00:08:13,982 --> 00:08:15,677
I've thought about it.

123
00:08:15,751 --> 00:08:18,948
My company's taken out
a large life insurance policy on me.

124
00:08:19,021 --> 00:08:23,459
Suicide would nullify it,
but murder does not.

125
00:08:28,798 --> 00:08:31,700
- Why me?
- You're a drifter.

126
00:08:31,769 --> 00:08:35,296
A, uh... pardon the expression...
a junkie.

127
00:08:35,372 --> 00:08:38,137
Nobody would notice
if you disappeared.

128
00:08:39,211 --> 00:08:42,339
I've been watching you
for a couple of weeks.

129
00:08:42,414 --> 00:08:44,575
Maybe I'm
just on vacation.

130
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:48,086
Not with the scum
you hang out with.

131
00:08:48,154 --> 00:08:51,851
No, I've watched...
and I've thought.

132
00:08:51,924 --> 00:08:53,653
Is an elegant plan.

133
00:08:53,726 --> 00:08:55,854
I've even figured out
your escape.

134
00:08:55,963 --> 00:08:57,328
Swell.

135
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:03,569
Has it ever occurred to you
I might not want to murder you?

136
00:09:04,572 --> 00:09:07,405
I've got $50,000
says you will.

137
00:09:08,176 --> 00:09:10,576
50,000.

138
00:09:10,645 --> 00:09:12,637
And a guarantee you
won't get caught.

139
00:09:12,715 --> 00:09:14,706
I'm still here.

140
00:09:16,018 --> 00:09:18,077
I want it done Thursday
around 8:00 p.m.

141
00:09:18,153 --> 00:09:21,817
My wife will be out,
and is the staff's night off.

142
00:09:22,893 --> 00:09:25,157
- These will be open.
- Wouldn't they normally be locked?

143
00:09:25,228 --> 00:09:27,992
Sometimes. The staff
usually forgets.

144
00:09:28,064 --> 00:09:30,397
I have the same trouble
with my help.

145
00:09:30,468 --> 00:09:33,733
I'll be here
waiting for you.

146
00:09:33,804 --> 00:09:35,863
The safe will be open.

147
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:39,942
There will be
$50,000 in it.

148
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:43,709
You'll be wearing rubber gloves.
Do you own rubber gloves?

149
00:09:43,782 --> 00:09:46,877
I rent 'em. I have
a lease with an option to buy.

150
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,912
Now in this drawer...

151
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:52,949
Ah!

152
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:54,494
A.357 Magnum.

153
00:09:54,562 --> 00:09:56,928
My.357. You use it.

154
00:09:56,997 --> 00:09:59,329
No one can trace it to you.

155
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,391
The room will be
in disarray.

156
00:10:01,468 --> 00:10:03,903
Like a burglary attempt?

157
00:10:04,906 --> 00:10:08,034
You come in and catch me
stealing your ties and money?

158
00:10:08,109 --> 00:10:13,047
We scuffle. The gun
gets loose and I shoot you.

159
00:10:13,115 --> 00:10:14,707
Precisely.

160
00:10:15,952 --> 00:10:18,854
- Are you a good shot?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

161
00:10:18,922 --> 00:10:22,380
Get me on the first shot,
if you can.

162
00:10:22,459 --> 00:10:25,223
- Do you have a passport?
- Can dig one up.

163
00:10:25,295 --> 00:10:29,665
Good. Now, after you kill me,
take the Jaguar.

164
00:10:29,734 --> 00:10:32,259
The keys will be
in the glove compartment.

165
00:10:33,338 --> 00:10:35,432
- Take it where?
- L.A.X.

166
00:10:35,507 --> 00:10:37,771
Pan Am will have a ticket for you.

167
00:10:37,843 --> 00:10:39,834
- Where am I going?
- Rio.

168
00:10:39,912 --> 00:10:42,312
It departs at 11 p.m.

169
00:10:42,381 --> 00:10:44,612
They serve dinner onboard?

170
00:10:44,684 --> 00:10:46,777
And a movie and drinks.

171
00:10:46,853 --> 00:10:50,345
Stay down there
for a year.

172
00:10:51,391 --> 00:10:52,689
So?

173
00:10:54,395 --> 00:10:55,987
So...

174
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,360
You certainly
thought this out.

175
00:11:01,436 --> 00:11:03,961
I don't leave
a great deal to chance.

176
00:11:06,441 --> 00:11:08,239
Those will be open?

177
00:11:08,311 --> 00:11:10,836
Take care of the gloves,
the passport and the aim.

178
00:11:10,913 --> 00:11:12,312
I'll handle
everything else.

179
00:11:12,382 --> 00:11:15,317
The gun, the money,
the tickets...

180
00:11:15,385 --> 00:11:16,819
and the dying.

181
00:11:16,887 --> 00:11:18,878
Thas right.

182
00:11:19,957 --> 00:11:22,255
Looks like you
get the hard part.

183
00:11:22,326 --> 00:11:24,260
What do you say?

184
00:11:24,328 --> 00:11:26,923
You'll be doing me
a great service.

185
00:11:29,367 --> 00:11:31,494
Will you kill me?

186
00:11:36,275 --> 00:11:37,469
Sure.

187
00:11:51,793 --> 00:11:53,886
Hey! Good to see you.

188
00:11:53,961 --> 00:11:56,452
Slouch,
how are you?

189
00:11:57,965 --> 00:11:59,490
Can I steal you?

190
00:11:59,568 --> 00:12:01,331
If you promise
not to return me.

191
00:12:01,403 --> 00:12:03,337
- Magic today?
- Yeah, Kareem's in the wash.

192
00:12:03,405 --> 00:12:05,032
I need a favor.

193
00:12:05,107 --> 00:12:07,599
- Fletch!
- Did you hear something?

194
00:12:07,677 --> 00:12:10,669
See what we have on Alan Stanwyk
in Beverly Hills.

195
00:12:10,747 --> 00:12:12,544
I need this right away.

196
00:12:12,615 --> 00:12:15,244
- I take it the story's done.
- W-Y-K.

197
00:12:15,319 --> 00:12:17,310
Tell me I'm right.

198
00:12:17,388 --> 00:12:19,379
You're right,
but you're very peaked.

199
00:12:19,457 --> 00:12:22,017
Want to vomit?
Come on in.

200
00:12:22,093 --> 00:12:24,426
- The story's done, right?
- Uh... almost.

201
00:12:24,496 --> 00:12:26,327
Almost is not an answer.

202
00:12:26,398 --> 00:12:28,525
Yes is an answer.

203
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,330
And a damn fine answer.

204
00:12:31,436 --> 00:12:33,496
Professional journalism time now.

205
00:12:33,573 --> 00:12:36,736
Go back and finish
the story!

206
00:12:36,809 --> 00:12:39,676
Frank, I will.
I swear it.

207
00:12:39,746 --> 00:12:41,112
Something came up.

208
00:12:41,181 --> 00:12:43,308
You've got
a deadline tomorrow.

209
00:12:43,383 --> 00:12:45,374
Did you see Sunday's ad?

210
00:12:45,452 --> 00:12:48,445
I don't read the paper.
Whas the spread on tonighs game?

211
00:12:48,523 --> 00:12:51,253
- Lakers by six.
- Take a look.

212
00:12:52,727 --> 00:12:54,820
Shame of the City.
Thas very nice.

213
00:12:54,896 --> 00:12:56,797
Try to follow this.

214
00:12:56,866 --> 00:12:59,858
You can't run the ad
and then not run the story.

215
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:02,594
You can't? Why not?

216
00:13:03,906 --> 00:13:05,397
Shit. Really?

217
00:13:06,977 --> 00:13:10,378
I'm putting you on. You'll get
the story. You'll be proud of it.

218
00:13:10,447 --> 00:13:12,813
You broke it?
You know the source?

219
00:13:12,883 --> 00:13:14,181
Practically.

220
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:17,085
Is it Fat Sam?
You said you had pictures of him.

221
00:13:17,155 --> 00:13:20,352
- I do have pictures of him dealing.
- Les go. We'll run them.

222
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:21,983
You can't do that.

223
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:25,223
Fat Sam isn't the story.
There's a source behind him.

224
00:13:25,297 --> 00:13:27,197
Who?

225
00:13:27,266 --> 00:13:28,893
Thas a gray area.

226
00:13:28,967 --> 00:13:30,128
How gray?

227
00:13:31,204 --> 00:13:32,364
Charcoal.

228
00:13:35,074 --> 00:13:37,065
May I help you with that?

229
00:13:38,211 --> 00:13:39,873
OK. A little lighter.

230
00:13:39,947 --> 00:13:41,915
Can you go higher?

231
00:13:41,982 --> 00:13:44,974
Over to the right.
Higher. Perfect.

232
00:13:45,052 --> 00:13:48,079
Nice and hard.
Thas good. Thank you.

233
00:13:48,156 --> 00:13:50,147
- That it?
- Perfect.

234
00:13:50,225 --> 00:13:51,988
Everything's recent.

235
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:55,553
Let me see that. Alan Stanwyk,
commercial airline pilot...

236
00:13:55,631 --> 00:13:57,565
from Provo, Utah."

237
00:13:57,633 --> 00:14:00,534
Formerly a test pilot,
member of the Jaycees.

238
00:14:00,603 --> 00:14:02,332
- Move on?
- Yeah.

239
00:14:03,774 --> 00:14:05,241
Married Boyd Aviation.

240
00:14:05,309 --> 00:14:07,368
He's no dummy.
Thas big bucks.

241
00:14:07,444 --> 00:14:11,312
His parents are Marvin and Velma,
were unable to attend the wedding.

242
00:14:11,381 --> 00:14:15,284
Those are three names I enjoy:
Marvin, Velma and Provo.

243
00:14:17,055 --> 00:14:18,818
Hold it there.

244
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:22,122
Cancer.
Cancer Society Benefit.

245
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:25,630
Internist Dr. Joseph Dolan.

246
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:28,827
I wonder if
thas his doctor.

247
00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:30,893
One way to find out.

248
00:14:30,971 --> 00:14:32,666
There is.

249
00:14:32,906 --> 00:14:35,500
Where do you
know Alan from?

250
00:14:35,575 --> 00:14:38,477
We play tennis
at the club.

251
00:14:38,546 --> 00:14:40,013
California Racquet Club?

252
00:14:40,081 --> 00:14:42,606
- Right.
- Thas my club too.

253
00:14:44,318 --> 00:14:46,583
I don't remember
seeing you there.

254
00:14:46,655 --> 00:14:50,523
I haven't been playing
because of these kidney pains.

255
00:14:50,592 --> 00:14:54,825
Right. How long have you
had these pains, Mr. Barber?

256
00:14:54,898 --> 00:14:56,456
No, thas Babar.

257
00:14:57,967 --> 00:14:59,059
Two B's?

258
00:15:00,069 --> 00:15:01,867
One B.
B-A-B-A-R.

259
00:15:01,939 --> 00:15:04,237
- Thas two.
- Yeah, but not together.

260
00:15:04,308 --> 00:15:06,208
I thought
thas what you meant.

261
00:15:09,213 --> 00:15:10,681
Arnold Babar.

262
00:15:10,749 --> 00:15:12,683
Aren't there
children's books...

263
00:15:12,751 --> 00:15:14,981
about an elephant
named Babar?

264
00:15:16,054 --> 00:15:19,183
- I don't know. I don't have any.
- No children?

265
00:15:19,258 --> 00:15:21,692
No, elephant books.

266
00:15:21,761 --> 00:15:23,695
Open wide.

267
00:15:24,463 --> 00:15:25,589
Say, Ah.

268
00:15:25,665 --> 00:15:27,031
Aah.

269
00:15:28,035 --> 00:15:30,003
Is an odd name.

270
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:32,971
I haven't seen it
on the club registry.

271
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,499
I don't formally belong.
I'm a guest of my auns.

272
00:15:36,577 --> 00:15:37,942
Your aunt?

273
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,073
- Right. Mrs. Smith.
- Joan or Margaret?

274
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:42,582
Uh-huh.

275
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,050
Which one?

276
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,212
Margaret.

277
00:15:48,123 --> 00:15:49,784
Funny old bird.

278
00:15:49,858 --> 00:15:51,884
I could tell you
some stories.

279
00:15:51,962 --> 00:15:53,452
I bet.

280
00:15:55,532 --> 00:15:58,797
You know,
is a shame about Ed.

281
00:15:58,868 --> 00:16:01,804
It was.
That was really a shame.

282
00:16:01,872 --> 00:16:03,806
To go so suddenly.

283
00:16:03,874 --> 00:16:06,035
He was dying
for years.

284
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:09,376
But the end
was very sudden.

285
00:16:11,283 --> 00:16:13,274
He was in intensive care
for eight weeks.

286
00:16:13,352 --> 00:16:15,343
But the very end,
when he actually died...

287
00:16:15,454 --> 00:16:17,423
was extremely sudden.

288
00:16:19,492 --> 00:16:23,087
Alan and I were recently
speaking of dying.

289
00:16:23,162 --> 00:16:26,462
He told me Boyd Aviation took out
a large insurance policy on him.

290
00:16:27,768 --> 00:16:29,793
You've got to be
in perfect shape...

291
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:32,600
to get that sort
of a policy, I bet.

292
00:16:32,673 --> 00:16:35,165
Drop your shorts
and bend over, Mr. Babar.

293
00:16:35,243 --> 00:16:38,269
No, really.
We don't need to.

294
00:16:38,346 --> 00:16:40,610
We don't want
to do that.

295
00:16:41,884 --> 00:16:43,943
My kidneys feel better
in this position.

296
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:46,921
Maybe is that I'm not doing
any calisthenics.

297
00:16:46,989 --> 00:16:49,184
If I did sit-ups
or bent over like this...

298
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,227
I'd feel 100% bet...

299
00:16:51,294 --> 00:16:54,491
# Moon River ##

300
00:16:54,564 --> 00:16:57,556
Whew! Thank you, Doc.
You ever serve time?

301
00:16:57,634 --> 00:16:59,796
- Breathe easy.
- Breathe easy.

302
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:04,199
I was surprised Alan
got that policy.

303
00:17:04,275 --> 00:17:06,470
There's a history of cancer
in the family.

304
00:17:06,544 --> 00:17:08,672
- There is?
- Yeah.

305
00:17:08,747 --> 00:17:12,239
As a matter of fact... Aah!
You using the whole fist?

306
00:17:12,317 --> 00:17:13,784
Just relax.

307
00:17:15,422 --> 00:17:18,687
I saw Alan the other day.
He was looking peaked.

308
00:17:18,758 --> 00:17:21,226
Are you sure
he's all right?

309
00:17:21,294 --> 00:17:24,287
I can't discuss another patient.
You know that.

310
00:17:25,132 --> 00:17:27,896
Well, I don't find
anything wrong with you.

311
00:17:27,968 --> 00:17:31,131
I'm sure is not
for a lack of looking.

312
00:17:33,508 --> 00:17:35,032
12 noon.

313
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:37,510
I was anxious
to return to my drug story.

314
00:17:37,579 --> 00:17:40,242
But since Dr. Jellyfinger
wasn't talking...

315
00:17:40,316 --> 00:17:43,308
I had to find out
about Stanwyk's health.

316
00:17:47,824 --> 00:17:50,225
May I help you, Dr., uh...

317
00:17:50,294 --> 00:17:52,421
Dr. Rosenpenis. I'm here
to check Stanwyk's file.

318
00:17:52,496 --> 00:17:53,690
Doctor who?

319
00:17:53,764 --> 00:17:55,129
Dr. Rosenrosen.

320
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,134
Your name again.

321
00:17:57,202 --> 00:17:58,897
Is Dr. Rosenhite.

322
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:00,597
Doctor who?

323
00:18:00,672 --> 00:18:02,697
Dr. Rosen.
Where's the records room?

324
00:18:02,774 --> 00:18:05,835
- Next to Pathology.
- Would you take care of these things?

325
00:18:05,911 --> 00:18:09,369
I'd like to check
Alan Stanwyk's file.

326
00:18:09,448 --> 00:18:12,315
Where the hell's
the records room?

327
00:18:12,384 --> 00:18:14,615
Next to Pathology, B1.

328
00:18:14,688 --> 00:18:17,521
Collate these for me.
Where did you say that was?

329
00:18:17,591 --> 00:18:19,559
- B1.
- Thank you very much.

330
00:18:19,626 --> 00:18:21,560
- Take the elevator.
- Thank you.

331
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:59,302
Give me a hand, Doctor.

332
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:01,202
Me?

333
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:02,900
Come on!

334
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:09,609
Yeah.

335
00:19:13,587 --> 00:19:15,987
Have you ever seen a spleen
that large?

336
00:19:16,056 --> 00:19:19,321
No, not since breakfast.

337
00:19:19,393 --> 00:19:20,952
Here. Hold this.

338
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:24,260
I haven't sterilized
my hands.

339
00:19:24,332 --> 00:19:27,495
You won't make him
any sicker.

00:19:38,014 --> 00:19:40,608
I'll get it.

00:19:43,887 --> 00:19:45,549
Ah, oh!

00:19:45,623 --> 00:19:48,717
You never get used
to the smell, do ya?

[Crash]

347
00:19:56,902 --> 00:20:00,429
Oh, Doctor.
Are you all right?

348
00:20:00,505 --> 00:20:01,836
Where am I?

349
00:20:01,907 --> 00:20:04,376
- The records room.
- The records room?

350
00:20:04,444 --> 00:20:07,345
- I'm fine.
- Can I get you something?

351
00:20:07,413 --> 00:20:10,474
Do you have
The Beatles' White Album?

352
00:20:10,551 --> 00:20:12,678
Never mind. Get me
a glass of hot fat.

353
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,744
And bring me the head
of Alfredo Garcia.

354
00:20:14,822 --> 00:20:19,021
Dr. Holmes was
surprised you fainted.

355
00:20:19,094 --> 00:20:21,153
He was surprised?

356
00:20:21,229 --> 00:20:23,254
I thought that body
was my dead brother.

357
00:20:23,331 --> 00:20:25,231
Oh!

358
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,201
That spleen was
the spitting image.

359
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:29,170
No, I'm fine.

360
00:20:32,308 --> 00:20:34,902
Nurse, I'm hyperventilating.

361
00:20:34,977 --> 00:20:36,969
Would you get me
a paper bag?

362
00:20:37,047 --> 00:20:39,106
- Yes, right away.
- Thank you.

363
00:21:28,371 --> 00:21:30,305
Here you are, Doctor.

364
00:21:30,373 --> 00:21:31,772
Oh, thank you.

365
00:21:31,841 --> 00:21:33,775
Can I help you?

366
00:21:33,844 --> 00:21:35,835
No. Uh, yes, there is,
actually.

367
00:21:39,516 --> 00:21:42,509
One of my associates
was doing a biopsy on this man.

368
00:21:42,587 --> 00:21:46,353
They said he had a melanoma,
carcinoma... some kind of noma.

369
00:21:47,859 --> 00:21:49,952
There's no record
of it here.

370
00:21:50,028 --> 00:21:52,930
If he had one,
it would be in here.

371
00:21:54,533 --> 00:21:56,125
Wait. Here it is.

372
00:21:56,202 --> 00:21:58,193
Surgical removal
of two moles.

373
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:00,330
Tissue was benign."

374
00:22:02,008 --> 00:22:04,340
Benign? There's no mention
of cancer? Thas it?

375
00:22:04,411 --> 00:22:05,901
Thas it.

376
00:22:07,482 --> 00:22:09,507
This is one month ago.

377
00:22:10,651 --> 00:22:13,882
According to this hospital,
Alan Stanwyk does not have cancer.

378
00:22:13,955 --> 00:22:15,479
I guess not.

379
00:22:16,325 --> 00:22:17,986
He'll be so relieved.

380
00:22:19,962 --> 00:22:22,430
- Thank you very much.
- My pleasure.

381
00:22:22,498 --> 00:22:24,490

I'm not finished.

384
00:22:54,667 --> 00:22:56,862
- Sorry, Mr. Underhill.
- Do I look finished?

385
00:22:56,936 --> 00:22:58,336
I guess not.

386
00:22:59,673 --> 00:23:02,733
- Now I'm finished.
- Whatever you say.

387
00:23:10,685 --> 00:23:13,085
You're expecting
a nice gratuity, right?

388
00:23:15,724 --> 00:23:17,316
Maybe next time.

389
00:23:21,363 --> 00:23:22,695
Gail Stanwyk?

390
00:23:22,766 --> 00:23:25,098
Yeah.

391
00:23:25,168 --> 00:23:27,033
I haven't seen you
since the wedding. You look great.

392
00:23:27,103 --> 00:23:29,401
I do?
Thas sweet of you.

393
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:34,472
I musve been plowed
at your wedding.

394
00:23:34,545 --> 00:23:36,410
I don't know you.

395
00:23:37,648 --> 00:23:39,640
Not my wedding,
your wedding.

396
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:42,812
Oh, my wedding.
Thank God.

397
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:46,289
Doesn't really help me.
Are you a friend of Alan's?

398
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:48,486
Yes, we flew together.
I'm John.

00:23:48,561 --> 00:23:50,495
Oh, John.

Oh, yes.

John Cocktoasttoy.

Beautiful name.

404
00:24:01,842 --> 00:24:03,309
Is Scotch-Rumanian.

405
00:24:03,377 --> 00:24:05,778
- An odd combination.
- So were my parents.

406
00:24:06,815 --> 00:24:10,251
Do you mind if I
practice some more?

407
00:24:10,318 --> 00:24:11,808
Go ahead.

408
00:24:19,228 --> 00:24:21,891
You're a member
of the club, señor?

409
00:24:21,965 --> 00:24:24,433
No. I'm with the Underhills.

410
00:24:24,501 --> 00:24:26,059
They left, señor.

411
00:24:26,136 --> 00:24:29,129
He'll be back
after his urinalysis.

412
00:24:29,207 --> 00:24:31,266
Would you like some drinks?

413
00:24:31,342 --> 00:24:33,401
I'll put it on
the Underhills' bill.

414
00:24:35,346 --> 00:24:37,713
Yes. I'll have
a Bloody Mary...

415
00:24:37,783 --> 00:24:40,547
a steak sandwich,
and a steak sandwich.

416
00:24:45,792 --> 00:24:47,191
So how's Alan?

417
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:51,560
He's been so busy lately,
I hardly see him.

418
00:24:51,631 --> 00:24:54,396
- He's been preoccupied.
- With what?

419
00:24:54,468 --> 00:24:57,096
I don't know.
Personal stuff.

420
00:24:57,171 --> 00:24:59,696
Whoa!
I hit one.

421
00:24:59,774 --> 00:25:01,867
Lobs are important
in tennis.

422
00:25:01,943 --> 00:25:03,036
Sorry, sir.

423
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:08,577
I'll show you
a couple things.

424
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:10,413
Stand here.

425
00:25:10,485 --> 00:25:13,683
When the ball comes,
face it like this.

426
00:25:13,756 --> 00:25:15,246
Yeah.

427
00:25:15,325 --> 00:25:16,917
And then
pivot your body,

428
00:25:16,993 --> 00:25:19,485
step in
with your left foot.

429
00:25:19,563 --> 00:25:21,394
Just like this.

430
00:25:21,465 --> 00:25:22,864
OK?

431
00:25:22,933 --> 00:25:24,594
Go ahead. Try one.

432
00:25:24,668 --> 00:25:26,158
All right.
Go ahead.

433
00:25:26,236 --> 00:25:28,171
Get in position.

434
00:25:28,239 --> 00:25:31,436
The ball's going to come.
Ready?

435
00:25:31,509 --> 00:25:33,170
How many are
in the machine?

436
00:25:33,244 --> 00:25:35,839
- A lot, I thought.
- Is finished.

437
00:25:35,915 --> 00:25:37,712
Good.
Much better.

438
00:25:38,951 --> 00:25:42,352
I must be having an off day.
I'm usually a fabulous player.

439
00:25:42,421 --> 00:25:44,447
I affect women this way.

440
00:25:44,524 --> 00:25:46,458
I bet you do.

441
00:25:46,526 --> 00:25:50,155
I bumped into Alan
this morning.

442
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:52,221
You know what
I can't figure out?

443
00:25:52,299 --> 00:25:53,927
Alan's in Utah.

444
00:25:54,002 --> 00:25:57,733
I can't figure out what I was doing
in Utah this morning.

445
00:26:00,508 --> 00:26:04,104
I'm very flattered,
but I'm also very married.

446
00:26:05,614 --> 00:26:08,048
You're hitting
on me, aren't you?

447
00:26:08,117 --> 00:26:09,380
How did you guess?

448
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:13,618
I'm such a heel.
Don't know what came over me.

449
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:17,787
If I had a nickel
for every one of Alan's flyboy
buddies who tried to pick me up...

450
00:26:17,862 --> 00:26:19,261
I'd be rich.

451
00:26:19,363 --> 00:26:21,160
You are rich.

452
00:26:21,232 --> 00:26:22,961
See what I mean?

453
00:26:25,837 --> 00:26:29,273
The vice president knew
I was opening the door...

454
00:26:29,341 --> 00:26:31,070
but the Secret Service...

455
00:26:31,143 --> 00:26:32,610
Whack!
And blood...

456
00:26:34,914 --> 00:26:36,506
Washington.

457
00:26:36,582 --> 00:26:38,345
Sugar, Mr. Poon?

458
00:26:38,418 --> 00:26:40,579
No, never, never.
Thank you.

459
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,760
Well, now,
let me reiterate...

460
00:26:48,829 --> 00:26:51,196
that this is not
a formal investigation.

461
00:26:51,266 --> 00:26:55,498
If Alan Stanwyk isn't involved
in improprieties...

462
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:58,971
Alan Stanwyk is not involved
in any improprieties.

463
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:02,909
How can the S.E.C.
make such an accusation?

464
00:27:02,978 --> 00:27:05,242
You know that,
and I know that...

465
00:27:05,314 --> 00:27:08,614
but somebody's bucking
for a promotion.

466
00:27:08,685 --> 00:27:10,812
Is probably that
pederast Hanrahan.

467
00:27:10,887 --> 00:27:12,946
If I don't go back
with something...

468
00:27:13,023 --> 00:27:15,389
you and your son-in-law
will be the scapegoats.

469
00:27:15,459 --> 00:27:18,122
Unbelievable.
This is unbelievable.

470
00:27:18,196 --> 00:27:21,131
They want to know
why he's in Utah.

471
00:27:21,199 --> 00:27:24,692
Jesus H. Christ
on a Popsicle stick.

472
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:26,032
First of all...

473
00:27:26,105 --> 00:27:29,438
Alan Stanwyk does not own
one single share of stock.

474
00:27:30,309 --> 00:27:32,402
The $3 million
for the ranch in Provo...

475
00:27:32,479 --> 00:27:34,640
was entirely provided
by my daughter...

476
00:27:34,714 --> 00:27:40,050
who converted her personal,
non-corporate holdings.

477
00:27:41,422 --> 00:27:44,118
So, if any
of your D.C. boys...

478
00:27:44,191 --> 00:27:47,524
want to challenge that,
bring them on.

479
00:27:47,595 --> 00:27:52,624
Otherwise, tell them
to get out of my face.

480
00:27:55,871 --> 00:27:58,238
God, I admire you.

481
00:28:01,911 --> 00:28:03,435
Well...

482
00:28:03,513 --> 00:28:05,504
consider
this case closed.

483
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:11,781
It stopped bleeding.
Isn't that something?

484
00:28:11,855 --> 00:28:13,288
My pleasure.

485
00:28:13,357 --> 00:28:15,349
Thank you and good day.

486
00:28:15,426 --> 00:28:16,757
By the way...

487
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:20,454
what kind

488
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:23,799
Comanche Indian.
Good-bye.

489

Madeline, Frieda lost the number
for Alan's realtor in Provo, Utah.

490
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:30,099
Could you get me that?

491
00:28:30,176 --> 00:28:32,236
- Jim Swarthout?
- Yeah.

492
00:28:35,982 --> 00:28:37,882
- Who are you again?
- I'm Frieda's boss.

493
00:28:38,885 --> 00:28:41,286
- Who's Frieda?
- My secretary.

494
00:28:44,292 --> 00:28:47,386
I knew my junkie pals were awaiting
my good cheer on the beach...

495
00:28:47,461 --> 00:28:50,454
but I needed a second wind,
a beer and a wardrobe change.

496
00:28:54,169 --> 00:28:56,900
As I pulled up to
my imitation apartment building...

497
00:28:56,973 --> 00:29:01,706
I observed the Oldsmobuick
of Mr. Arnold T. Pants, Esquire...

498
00:29:01,778 --> 00:29:04,839
attorney for the former
Mrs. Erwin Fletcher.

499
00:29:06,116 --> 00:29:08,778
Time to use
the service entrance.

500
00:29:43,925 --> 00:29:47,862
Refusal to pay alimony
is a jailable offense, Fletch.

501
00:29:51,467 --> 00:29:53,901
What about trespassing
and loitering?

502
00:29:53,969 --> 00:29:56,131
I am neither loitering
nor trespassing.

503
00:29:56,206 --> 00:29:58,538
I've simply chosen
an advisable location...

504
00:29:58,608 --> 00:30:01,133
to await my cliens
delinquent husband.

505
00:30:01,211 --> 00:30:04,306
I prefer to discuss
business inside.

506
00:30:08,085 --> 00:30:10,076
Leave your rubbers outside.

507

A little one-on-one?

508
00:30:18,764 --> 00:30:21,097
He draws the foul.

509
00:30:23,836 --> 00:30:26,066
You owe Wendy $918.

510
00:30:26,139 --> 00:30:29,234
She doesn't need it. She's been
living with somebody for months.

511
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:31,335
I don't
what you're referring to.

512
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:33,277
Wendy maintains
her own residence.

513
00:30:33,347 --> 00:30:34,780
This stinks.

514
00:30:34,848 --> 00:30:38,216
I empathize, Fletch.
However, you threw her out.

515
00:30:38,286 --> 00:30:40,345
She slept with everybody.

516
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:42,219
Prove that in court.

517
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:44,155
My lawyer was a bum.

518
00:30:44,225 --> 00:30:45,523
I agree.

519
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:47,152
They slept together.

520
00:30:47,229 --> 00:30:49,754
You may be right.

521
00:30:49,832 --> 00:30:51,231
Are you serious?

522

be solved. Ed McMahon.

just won $1 million.

527

Erwin M. Fletcher,
you choose.

528
00:31:11,357 --> 00:31:13,882
Whoo-ee! I lost. Sorry.

529
00:31:13,959 --> 00:31:15,620
Is no joke, Fletch.

530
00:31:15,694 --> 00:31:20,655
If some kind of payment isn't made,
I'll have to garnish your wages.

531
00:31:21,901 --> 00:31:24,426
I can't have
my wages garnish-ied.

532
00:31:24,504 --> 00:31:25,493

533

Cash? I'm impressed.

534
00:31:29,043 --> 00:31:31,034
I saw my pimp today.

535

Open your raincoat.

536
00:31:33,414 --> 00:31:35,815
Come on. Just once.
Is worth it.

- Till then.

a nice piece of ass.

Our guest is
the most valuable player...

541
00:32:06,284 --> 00:32:08,480
of the National
Basketball Association...

542
00:32:08,554 --> 00:32:10,488
from the Los Angeles Lakers...

543
00:32:10,556 --> 00:32:13,684
the all-time scoring champion
of the N.B.A., Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

544
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:16,695
He's coming off a game that was
second to none in his brilliant career.

545
00:32:16,763 --> 00:32:18,128
You must be proud.

546
00:32:18,198 --> 00:32:20,325
Definitely, Chick.
It was a great effort.

547
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,494
But I had a lot of help,
and we're just glad to be here.

How about Fletch?

549
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:28,703
What can I say about Fletch?
He's been fantastic.

550
00:32:28,776 --> 00:32:31,574
He boxes out for us,
gets the tough rebounds...

551
00:32:31,646 --> 00:32:33,808
and does what
we need to win.

552
00:32:33,882 --> 00:32:37,045
Is great working with him. I don't
know where we'd be without him.

553
00:32:38,387 --> 00:32:41,915
Les look at the play.
He's 6'5. With the Afro, 6'9.

554
00:32:41,991 --> 00:32:45,791
Good dribbler. Comes in deep.
His club is behind by one point.

555
00:32:45,862 --> 00:32:49,594
Fletch puts the ball through the legs.
What a great play!

556
00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:52,101
He puts it in!
The Lakers have the lead!

557
00:32:52,169 --> 00:32:56,230
Was that some play! This kid
from Harlem really creates excitement.

558
00:32:56,307 --> 00:33:00,642
$4 million a year,
but he earns every nickel.

559
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:04,808
Look how he shakes off
four or five defenders with ease.

560
00:33:04,883 --> 00:33:08,479
Fletch... he truly defines
grace under pressure.

561
00:33:13,259 --> 00:33:17,856
See if you've got anything on Stanwyk
from when he lived in Utah.

562
00:33:17,931 --> 00:33:21,230
Yeah. And check out a realtor
in Provo named Swarthout.

00:33:41,491 --> 00:33:43,322
Take off, Fletch!

Gummy again.

Don't...

00:34:00,979 --> 00:34:02,571

577
00:34:23,171 --> 00:34:25,162
Hey, you're really nuts.

578
00:34:26,408 --> 00:34:27,602
You OK?

579
00:34:27,676 --> 00:34:29,702
Yeah. I feel like $100.

580
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:34,045
- They didn't do anything.
- What are you talking about?

581
00:34:34,116 --> 00:34:36,016
I busted their window.

You're lucky.

583
00:34:38,055 --> 00:34:40,080
Is not luck.
They didn't want me.

584

They wanted Gummy.

Relax, Frank.
I need more time.

587
00:34:59,378 --> 00:35:01,278

on the back burner.

I hate dogs.

644
00:41:15,298 --> 00:41:16,959
Come on. Smile.
Say, Fletch.

645
00:41:21,372 --> 00:41:23,306
Look, defenseless babies.

646
00:41:28,313 --> 00:41:30,338
Fell for the oldest trick
in the book.

647
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:54,399
# Strangers in the night #

648
00:41:54,476 --> 00:41:56,876
# Exchanging clothing #

649
00:41:56,945 --> 00:41:59,379
# Strangers in my pants... ##

650
00:42:01,684 --> 00:42:03,174
Surprise!

651
00:42:03,252 --> 00:42:05,618
- What the hell's...
- Police. Spread 'em!

652
00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:10,223
- Got a gun?
- Shamu's got one. Borrow his.

653
00:42:11,395 --> 00:42:13,556
- What have we here?
- Thas my dick.

654
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:15,564
Oh, funny boy.

655
00:42:15,632 --> 00:42:17,225
What have we here?

656
00:42:17,302 --> 00:42:19,202
Looks like heroin, Gene.

657
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:21,261
You just planted that.

658
00:42:21,339 --> 00:42:24,365
- Whad you say?
- Wanna read me my rights?

659
00:42:24,442 --> 00:42:26,707
You have the right
to remain silent.

660
00:42:26,779 --> 00:42:28,804
You have the right
to have your face kicked in.

661
00:42:28,881 --> 00:42:29,939
Nice.

662
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:32,142
You have the right to have
your balls stomped by him.

663
00:42:32,952 --> 00:42:34,318
I'll waive my rights.

664
00:42:45,166 --> 00:42:46,963
Whas the booking, gentlemen?

665
00:42:47,034 --> 00:42:49,696
Possession of narcotics.
The chief wants to talk to him.

666
00:42:49,771 --> 00:42:53,173
You'll like Chief Karlin.
He's a nice man.

667
00:42:53,242 --> 00:42:56,370
I hear he's mellowed
since he came out of the closet.

668
00:42:56,445 --> 00:42:58,937
Take his picture
while he still has a face.

669
00:42:59,015 --> 00:43:01,210
That hurts.
You've been hurting.

670
00:43:02,619 --> 00:43:04,109
Give him a buzz.

671
00:43:04,187 --> 00:43:05,711
Come in.

672
00:43:05,789 --> 00:43:07,781
Here he is, Chief.

673
00:43:10,895 --> 00:43:13,227
Easy, fellas. I'll be
with you in a moment.

674
00:43:26,813 --> 00:43:29,577
Did Mrs. Chief of Police
help you decorate?

675
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:34,947
So... whas your name?

676
00:43:35,022 --> 00:43:36,489
Fletch.

677
00:43:36,557 --> 00:43:40,289
- Full name.
- Fletch. F. Fletch.

678
00:43:40,361 --> 00:43:44,559
I see. What do you do
for a living, Mr. Fletch?

679
00:43:44,632 --> 00:43:46,122
I'm a shepherd.

680
00:43:47,335 --> 00:43:50,999
Officers, could you excuse us
for a few moments?

681
00:43:52,141 --> 00:43:54,336
Go to the gym
and pump each other.

682
00:43:58,715 --> 00:44:00,979
Why are you doing this?

683
00:44:01,985 --> 00:44:03,179
I like men.

684
00:44:03,253 --> 00:44:05,245
I like to be manhandled.

685
00:44:07,091 --> 00:44:08,956
I like you.

686
00:44:09,026 --> 00:44:12,462
For someone caught holding
a bag of heroin...

687
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:16,023
- That was planted.
- We're looking at maybe 10 years.

688
00:44:16,101 --> 00:44:18,262
Is that what you want, Jane Doe?

689
00:44:19,271 --> 00:44:21,330
Your editor phoned me...

690
00:44:21,406 --> 00:44:23,432
to respond to allegations
you're about to print...

691
00:44:23,509 --> 00:44:26,808
concerning police involvement
in narcotics dealings.

692
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:30,874
Uh-uh. I'm about to bust
that beach wide open.

693
00:44:30,951 --> 00:44:33,351
I don't need some penny-ante
Woodward and Bernstein...

694
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:35,479
to get in the way
of my men.

695
00:44:35,556 --> 00:44:39,493
Your men may be involved in this.
I would think that might interest you.

696
00:44:39,561 --> 00:44:41,188
Idiot!

697
00:44:43,698 --> 00:44:46,189
All right.
Strictly off the record, OK?

698
00:44:46,268 --> 00:44:47,634
Yeah, OK.

699
00:44:47,703 --> 00:44:50,638
I got that beach crawling
with undercover cops.

700
00:44:50,706 --> 00:44:54,972
But if you go nosing around,
you'll make the bad guys more cautious.

701
00:44:55,044 --> 00:44:57,309
Makes my job harder.

702
00:44:57,381 --> 00:45:01,249
And listen, if you print
your story this week...

703
00:45:01,318 --> 00:45:03,879
it might get
some of my men killed.

704
00:45:03,955 --> 00:45:06,617
I can't have that,
Mr. Fletch.

705
00:45:06,691 --> 00:45:08,022
You understand?

706
00:45:08,092 --> 00:45:09,423
Yeah.

707
00:45:09,494 --> 00:45:10,984
I understand.

708
00:45:13,132 --> 00:45:14,531
I got a deadline.

709
00:45:15,734 --> 00:45:17,725
The name's Karlin
with a K?

710
00:45:17,803 --> 00:45:19,668
You dipshit!

711
00:45:20,807 --> 00:45:23,833
Go back to that beach,
you won't live to regret it!

712
00:45:23,910 --> 00:45:25,537
All right?

713
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:28,612
Hey, you and
Tommy Lasorda.

714
00:45:28,683 --> 00:45:31,208
- Yeah.
- I hate Tommy Lasorda.

715
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:40,225
Hey!

716
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:44,689
I'll take care of it now.

717
00:45:44,766 --> 00:45:47,702
# Swing low,
sweet chariot #

718
00:45:47,770 --> 00:45:50,204
I'll handle it from here.

719
00:45:50,273 --> 00:45:53,903
# Comin' for
to carry me home ##

720
00:45:53,978 --> 00:45:55,468
Can't keep me here.

721
00:45:55,546 --> 00:45:57,946
Maybe I won't keep you.

722
00:45:58,015 --> 00:46:01,041
Maybe I'll blow
your brains out.

723
00:46:02,854 --> 00:46:05,914
I do believe thas
a violation of my rights.

724
00:46:05,991 --> 00:46:10,052
After I shoot you,
I stick myself with this knife...

725
00:46:10,128 --> 00:46:12,222
and place it
in your dead hand.

726
00:46:12,298 --> 00:46:14,596
Self-defense.

727
00:46:14,667 --> 00:46:18,262
We don't do it anymore,
but back in the old days...

728
00:46:20,741 --> 00:46:21,969
You're serious.

729
00:46:22,042 --> 00:46:24,101
Ask anybody.

730
00:46:25,178 --> 00:46:27,807
Can I ask anybody now?

731
00:46:27,882 --> 00:46:29,941
Can I call my mom,
tell her I love her.

732
00:46:30,018 --> 00:46:32,111
Uh... guess not.

733
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,662
I'm a newspaper reporter. You don't
blow away newspaper reporters.

734
00:46:46,736 --> 00:46:48,727
Kinda stupid, isn't it?

735
00:46:48,805 --> 00:46:50,534
What will it be, Fletch?

736
00:46:56,547 --> 00:46:59,277
Hey, I hate the beach anyway.

737
00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:01,342
Is not even my story.

738
00:47:03,388 --> 00:47:05,481
I've got a deadline
on the off-track betting...

739
00:47:05,557 --> 00:47:07,081
in the Himalayas.

740
00:47:07,159 --> 00:47:09,651
Smaller story, but I know
you've been following it.

741
00:47:12,131 --> 00:47:15,362
You have things
under control down there.

742
00:47:15,435 --> 00:47:17,461
Your beach.

743
00:47:24,545 --> 00:47:26,537
Come on out.
Come on.

744
00:47:26,581 --> 00:47:28,014
May I? Thank you.

745
00:47:28,249 --> 00:47:29,978
How could you call him?

746
00:47:30,051 --> 00:47:31,313
Fletch, I'm sorry.

747
00:47:31,386 --> 00:47:33,354
You know how close
to death I came?

748
00:47:33,421 --> 00:47:35,253
Yeah, is awful.

749
00:47:36,325 --> 00:47:39,692
He had a gun at my head
and a knife in his hand!

750
00:47:39,762 --> 00:47:41,593
He threatened
to kill me.

751
00:47:41,664 --> 00:47:43,826
Hey, thas a shame.

752
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:45,834
He woulïve shot me.

753
00:47:45,902 --> 00:47:46,926
Unbelievable.

754
00:47:52,777 --> 00:47:54,301
You don't believe me.

755
00:47:54,345 --> 00:47:55,835
Nope.

756
00:47:56,681 --> 00:47:58,946
- He thinks I'm lying.
- Unbelievable.

757
00:47:59,017 --> 00:48:01,247
I need an article
by tomorrow.

758
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:03,254
- You believe me.
- Yes, I do.

759
00:48:03,322 --> 00:48:06,223
I don't want unsubstantiated charges
about dope-dealing cops...

760
00:48:06,291 --> 00:48:10,786
or paranoid fantasies
about homicidal police chiefs.

761
00:48:10,864 --> 00:48:12,957
Give me something
I can print!

762
00:48:14,467 --> 00:48:15,560
Print this.

763
00:48:18,706 --> 00:48:20,139
Me, too.

764
00:48:20,207 --> 00:48:23,769
Hey, watch it.
You're on thin ice, Larry.

765
00:48:31,286 --> 00:48:34,415
It was time to hang out
at Boyd Aviation...

766
00:48:34,490 --> 00:48:37,982
to find out what Stanwyk
was doing with that plane.

767
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:39,823
I splurged.

768
00:48:39,896 --> 00:48:42,889
I invested 49 cents
on some novelty teeth.

769
00:48:53,144 --> 00:48:55,203
Hey!

770
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:58,182
- You the guy from Ajax?
- Yeah, you bet.

771
00:48:58,250 --> 00:48:59,308
All right.

772
00:48:59,385 --> 00:49:01,376
- Thought you were bringing the eight?
- They're coming.

773
00:49:01,453 --> 00:49:05,184
I'm the supervisor.
I don't carry the stuff.

774
00:49:05,257 --> 00:49:07,158
Freddie's bringing them?

775
00:49:07,227 --> 00:49:08,694
Yeah. Freddie.

776
00:49:08,762 --> 00:49:12,163
You were supposed to be here
an hour ago.

777
00:49:12,232 --> 00:49:14,633
Traffic was murder.

778
00:49:14,702 --> 00:49:18,661
A manure spreader
jackknifed on the Santa Ana.

779
00:49:18,739 --> 00:49:20,673
God-awful mess.

780
00:49:20,741 --> 00:49:23,142
You should see my shoes.

781
00:49:23,212 --> 00:49:25,146
Whew!

782
00:49:27,950 --> 00:49:29,383
Stanwyk's baby, huh?

783
00:49:29,451 --> 00:49:31,113
Yeah.

784
00:49:31,187 --> 00:49:32,779
Uh-huh.

785
00:49:38,361 --> 00:49:39,886
Looks well-used.

786
00:49:39,964 --> 00:49:41,989
Travels to Utah every weekend.

787
00:49:42,066 --> 00:49:43,863
Is that right?

788
00:49:43,934 --> 00:49:45,629
Is he a Mormon?

789
00:49:48,173 --> 00:49:50,539
I don't think he's doing
a lot of singing...

790
00:49:50,609 --> 00:49:52,804
with the Tabernacle Choir.

791
00:49:52,877 --> 00:49:55,711
These executives live high.
Know what I mean?

792
00:49:55,781 --> 00:49:57,271
I sure do.

793
00:50:06,193 --> 00:50:09,026
Thas a terrific wing.
I love this shape.

794
00:50:11,698 --> 00:50:13,530
Do us a favor, pal.

795
00:50:13,601 --> 00:50:15,330
Name's Liddy.
Gordon Liddy.

796
00:50:15,403 --> 00:50:18,304
Take a look
at the seventh Fetzer valve.

797
00:50:18,373 --> 00:50:19,840
Is been sticking.

798
00:50:21,377 --> 00:50:23,038
Probably the humidity.

799
00:50:24,346 --> 00:50:25,745
Thas funny.

800
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:29,273
I think is
the by-pass line.

801
00:50:30,453 --> 00:50:33,889
It could be the by-pass line.
I should look at it.

802
00:50:38,562 --> 00:50:40,052
Uh, Gordo?

803
00:50:41,098 --> 00:50:42,588
Back here?

804
00:50:43,734 --> 00:50:45,999
Don't tell me
my business, boy!

805
00:50:46,071 --> 00:50:48,801
Just checking the luggage.

806
00:50:48,874 --> 00:50:52,571
Somebody should clean these windows.
There's gook all over 'em.

807
00:50:52,644 --> 00:50:54,374
Look at that.

808
00:50:55,548 --> 00:50:57,539
You use a lot of fuel
to go to Utah?

809
00:50:57,617 --> 00:50:59,209
I ask that, too.

810
00:50:59,285 --> 00:51:01,879
Burns enough to go
to South America and back.

811
00:51:01,954 --> 00:51:03,980
South America and back.

812
00:51:05,693 --> 00:51:07,251
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

813

Nothing.
He just gives me that look.

817
00:51:19,241 --> 00:51:21,402
You know,
he's got that look.

818
00:51:21,477 --> 00:51:23,945
Yeah, he just gives him
that look.

819
00:51:24,013 --> 00:51:25,913
Sure.
He's the boss.

820

Oh, ho ho.

I'll need some pliers...

828
00:51:47,773 --> 00:51:50,333
and a set of 30-weight
ball bearings.

- Yeah.

830
00:51:52,645 --> 00:51:55,170
Tell ya what.
I gotta go to my truck.

831
00:51:55,248 --> 00:51:58,217
If Fred gets here before I'm back,
tell him to start without me.

832
00:51:58,284 --> 00:52:01,311
Why do you need
ball bearings?

833
00:52:01,389 --> 00:52:02,788
Come on, guys.

834
00:52:02,857 --> 00:52:05,587
Maybe you need
a refresher course.

835
00:52:05,659 --> 00:52:08,651
Hey, is all
ball bearings nowadays.

836
00:52:11,933 --> 00:52:14,629
Prepare that valve
with 3-in-1 oil...

837
00:52:14,703 --> 00:52:16,762
and gauze pads.

838
00:52:16,838 --> 00:52:19,069
And I'll need 10 quarts

No, make that
Quaker State.

841
00:52:25,248 --> 00:52:27,945
And wash those windows.
They got muck on 'em.

Hi. Where's
Mrs. Stanwyk?

I'm supposed to meet her.
Cabana six?

846

Cabana one. You would like
something to eat or drink?

847
00:52:38,430 --> 00:52:39,897
Actually, I would.

848
00:52:39,964 --> 00:52:41,955
Charge it
to the Underhills?

849
00:52:42,033 --> 00:52:44,161
Right.
Do you have any caviar?

850
00:52:44,236 --> 00:52:46,932
Sí, señor. Beluga.
But it is $80 a portion.

851
00:52:47,006 --> 00:52:49,270
I better just take
two portions.

you'd say that.

Yeah.
Can I borrow your towel?

a water buffalo.

868
00:53:39,431 --> 00:53:41,024
Nice place.

869

I'm surprised to see you.
What are you doing here?

870
00:53:45,738 --> 00:53:47,638

For here?

872
00:53:48,976 --> 00:53:51,171
I knew this is where
my mouth would be.

873
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,209
I really should change.

874
00:53:55,282 --> 00:53:58,252
No, you should stay
the wonderful person you are today.

875
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:00,116
I mean put clothes on.

Um, because I'm bored.

If you're bored, why didn't you
go to Utah with Alan?

911
00:55:40,734 --> 00:55:44,363
Utah's not exactly
a cure for boredom.

Good point.

00:58:13,538 --> 00:58:15,836
Stop it. Stop.

966
00:58:15,941 --> 00:58:17,966
He's told me a lot of things.

967
00:58:18,043 --> 00:58:21,240
So far, not one has been true.

968
00:58:21,313 --> 00:58:23,281
I'm sorry to have to
tell you these things.

969
00:58:23,348 --> 00:58:25,476
- Mrs. Stanwyk!
- Just wait a minute!

970
00:58:26,653 --> 00:58:29,781
- I'll call my father. He'll know.
- No, you can't.

971
00:58:29,856 --> 00:58:33,850
I know you don't know me,
but you've gotta trust me.

972
00:58:36,363 --> 00:58:38,092
Give me 24 hours.

973
00:58:38,165 --> 00:58:40,099
Mrs. Stanwyk!

974
00:58:42,737 --> 00:58:44,398
You a Laker fan?

975
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:47,908
No.

976
00:58:47,976 --> 00:58:50,377
- Just a minute!
- I'll take you to a game.

977
00:58:50,446 --> 00:58:52,778
Mrs. Stanwyk!

978
00:58:55,418 --> 00:58:57,717
Sorry. Thanks. Bye.

979
00:58:57,788 --> 00:59:02,157
- What are you talking about?
- I'd like to take you to a Laker game.

980
00:59:02,192 --> 00:59:05,959
- If you need me, call the paper.
- What do I do for 24 hours?

981
00:59:06,030 --> 00:59:09,090
- Act natural.
- I was afraid you'd say that.

982
01:00:45,007 --> 01:00:49,104
Oh, Jesus. Whas he
doing with the chief?

983
01:00:50,113 --> 01:00:52,274
[Fletch] Seeing Bone Cancer
and Chief Karlin together...

984
01:00:52,349 --> 01:00:54,614
might lead
to a page one item.

985
01:00:54,685 --> 01:00:58,086
but without real evidence,
Frank wouldn't print it.

986
01:00:58,155 --> 01:01:01,147
I had to keep digging...
without a shovel.

987
01:01:39,535 --> 01:01:41,696
Smog Patrol.
Had your emissions checked?

988
01:01:41,771 --> 01:01:43,568
- No, sir.
- Fluorocarbons? Ozone?

989
01:01:43,639 --> 01:01:45,870
- No, sir.
- Well, les check it out.

990
01:01:45,942 --> 01:01:47,739
What do you say?

991
01:01:48,845 --> 01:01:49,869
Smells pretty good.

992
01:01:57,321 --> 01:01:59,380
Thas him.

993
01:02:00,625 --> 01:02:02,093
Unit 12, in pursuit.

994
01:02:09,234 --> 01:02:12,227
Catch some shuteye.
Lay back and enjoy.

995
01:02:13,306 --> 01:02:16,366
- Try to breathe through your nose.
- Aaah!

996
01:02:31,827 --> 01:02:35,389
I use chewing gum on these rides.
It filters out the pollutants.

997
01:02:35,465 --> 01:02:36,796
Aw, shit!

998
01:02:36,866 --> 01:02:39,334
You've got good grillwork.
Keep out the ozone.

999
01:02:39,402 --> 01:02:43,169
I gotta get this thing up to 95,
check out the fluorocarbon output.

1000
01:02:45,909 --> 01:02:49,845
Don't worry about the speed limit.
Thas why we've got the police escort.

1001
01:02:49,913 --> 01:02:51,973
- You a cop?
- As far as you know.

1002
01:02:52,050 --> 01:02:55,383
You gonna take me to jail
for car theft?

1003
01:02:55,453 --> 01:02:57,944
- Why, did you steal the car?
- I sure did!

1004
01:02:58,022 --> 01:03:01,015
I'm not even sure
thas a crime anymore.

1005
01:03:01,093 --> 01:03:02,526
Pull over!

1006
01:03:05,030 --> 01:03:07,191
Hey, look out
for that truck!

1007
01:03:11,371 --> 01:03:15,205
Just a game I play with my buddies.
Hide-and-seek kind of thing.

1008
01:03:15,275 --> 01:03:16,675
They love it.

1009
01:03:19,046 --> 01:03:20,673
What a day!

1010
01:03:20,748 --> 01:03:23,012
Must be a stage two.

1011
01:03:23,084 --> 01:03:24,985
Do a little slip-streaming.

1012
01:03:25,053 --> 01:03:27,248
Whoa! There's Fred!
Won't he be surprised!

1013
01:03:41,505 --> 01:03:44,872
Don't you hear me?
I said pull over...

1014
01:03:48,279 --> 01:03:49,577
Uh-oh.

1015
01:03:53,251 --> 01:03:55,014
Got a license?

1016
01:03:55,086 --> 01:03:56,883
Not on me.
You have one?

1017
01:03:56,955 --> 01:03:59,356
- No.
- Pull over, buddy!

1018
01:03:59,425 --> 01:04:03,623
- Hey, Freddie, how's the herpes?
- Pull over!

1019
01:04:03,696 --> 01:04:07,098
- I did before. I'll pull over later.
- Pull over!

1020
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:10,864
Thas it.
Turn your bike in!

1021
01:04:10,938 --> 01:04:13,406
- You're a disgrace to the force!
- [Kid] Aaah!

1022
01:04:33,263 --> 01:04:34,287
Get the door!

1023
01:04:44,075 --> 01:04:46,737
Congratulations.
You passed the test.

1024
01:04:46,811 --> 01:04:49,975
Raise your left hand.
My men will be right with you.

1025

01:05:28,391 --> 01:05:29,882
and Harold Arthur.

1030
01:05:31,962 --> 01:05:34,760
I would like for you to meet
our friends on the dais.

1031
01:05:34,831 --> 01:05:39,235
- Hold your applause until I'm finished.
- More coffee?

1032
01:05:39,304 --> 01:05:41,431
- Kitty Domaine, Selby Desner.
- There you go.

1033
01:05:41,506 --> 01:05:45,408
Barbara Wattell,
Walter Smith...

1034
01:05:45,476 --> 01:05:48,776
Martha Sterling
and Paul Fleming.

1035
01:05:48,847 --> 01:05:51,975
And to my right,
Michael Kenyon...

1036
01:05:53,085 --> 01:05:54,883
Olivia D. Williams...

1037

Bea Dorfman.

1039
01:05:58,692 --> 01:06:00,250
And now...

1040
01:06:00,327 --> 01:06:04,389
the Father of
Internal Bushings...

1041
01:06:04,465 --> 01:06:07,059
our very own
and beloved leader...

1042
01:06:07,134 --> 01:06:09,625
A man who needs
no introduction!

1043
01:06:09,704 --> 01:06:10,864
Thank you very much, Sammy.

1044
01:06:10,938 --> 01:06:12,372
I couldn't wait.

1045
01:06:12,441 --> 01:06:15,239
That was a very nice introduction,
and I am...

1046
01:06:15,310 --> 01:06:18,245
very thrilled
and proud to be here.

1047
01:06:18,313 --> 01:06:21,772
Is been a wonderful ceremony
here on behalf of our own Fred...

1048
01:06:21,851 --> 01:06:24,251
The Dorf Dorfman!

1049
01:06:25,288 --> 01:06:30,226
- Who is he?
- Fred was darn near death recently.

1050
01:06:30,294 --> 01:06:33,127
He wasn't ashamed to admit to me
that he had syphilis.

1051
01:06:33,197 --> 01:06:37,225
Thank God he stopped it
in its tracks.

1052
01:06:38,470 --> 01:06:41,132
It takes a lot for a man...

1053
01:06:42,407 --> 01:06:45,571
to admit where he got it from
and how he got it.

1054
01:06:45,644 --> 01:06:48,477
Look at him today.
Fred, you look just wonderful.

1055
01:06:48,547 --> 01:06:51,880
The nose looks normal again.
The face has come back into shape.

1056
01:06:51,951 --> 01:06:54,546
Is not drooling anymore.

1057
01:06:54,621 --> 01:06:58,216
And hats off to Marge, his wife,
because that whole experience...

1058
01:06:58,291 --> 01:07:01,728
the three weeks that she stayed
at Trembling Hills has paid off.

1059
01:07:01,796 --> 01:07:05,061
No more alcohol
or sedatives in her life.

1060
01:07:05,133 --> 01:07:07,863
There are many other things
I wanna tell you about Fred...

1061
01:07:07,935 --> 01:07:11,497
things that maybe many of you
already know.

1062
01:07:11,573 --> 01:07:14,872
Sammy, you're not going
to sing for us, are you?

1063
01:07:14,943 --> 01:07:19,074
Did you know that Fred
spent much of his life...

1064
01:07:19,149 --> 01:07:23,677
honoring a profession that has gone
largely unsung around here?

1065
01:07:23,753 --> 01:07:27,588
Some of them are here tonight.
The profession is law enforcement.

1066
01:07:27,658 --> 01:07:31,651
I know Fred feels that too often
our feelings are locked in...

1067
01:07:31,729 --> 01:07:34,197
and we feel restrained
and perhaps even embarrassed...

1068
01:07:34,265 --> 01:07:36,826
to reach out and touch
an officer of the law.

1069
01:07:36,902 --> 01:07:39,496
After all, they are people,
aren't they?

1070
01:07:39,571 --> 01:07:43,303
Stand up. Pat them on the back.
Reach out.

1071
01:07:43,376 --> 01:07:46,834
Shake hands with any one
of these men in blue.

1072
01:07:46,913 --> 01:07:49,381
Hug a cop!
Yeah, go ahead. I said it.

1073
01:07:49,449 --> 01:07:51,178
Yeah!
Thas a wonderful feeling!

1074
01:07:51,250 --> 01:07:53,242
I'm so proud tonight!

1075
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:58,053
# Oh, say can you see #

1076
01:07:58,125 --> 01:08:03,655
# By the dawn's
early light #

1077
01:08:03,731 --> 01:08:08,135
# What so proudly we hail #

1078
01:08:08,204 --> 01:08:10,570
# At the twilighs
last gleaming ##

1079
01:08:10,639 --> 01:08:12,368
Hip, hip, hooray!

1080
01:08:12,441 --> 01:08:14,306
Hooray!
Hooray!

1081
01:08:14,376 --> 01:08:15,707
Hooray!
Hooray!

1082
01:08:24,387 --> 01:08:26,720
Mr. Stanwyk,
you are confirmed on Flight 441...

1083
01:08:26,791 --> 01:08:30,022
to Rio de Janeiro tomorrow evening,
11 p.m., first class.

1084
01:08:30,094 --> 01:08:32,324
Thas terrific.
Thank you.

1085
01:08:32,396 --> 01:08:34,922
- You reconfirmed this morning.
- You bet I did.

1086
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,991
I'm a bear for detail.

1087
01:08:37,069 --> 01:08:39,333
I hope there's nobody
sitting next to me.

1088
01:08:39,404 --> 01:08:43,205
I always travel first class,
and I take both seats up.

1089
01:08:43,276 --> 01:08:46,177
I'm in bridge work.
Bridge construction.

1090
01:08:46,246 --> 01:08:49,682
These fold-outs
take a lot of space.

1091
01:08:49,749 --> 01:08:51,615
There is someone
next to you.

1092
01:08:51,685 --> 01:08:56,384
Oh, for God don don!
Who is it? Mr. Singleton?

1093
01:08:57,725 --> 01:09:01,287
- No. The name is Cavanaugh.
- Cavanaugh?

1094
01:09:01,363 --> 01:09:02,762
Ah! Morris or Pierre?

1095
01:09:04,232 --> 01:09:06,359
Sally Ann Cavanaugh.

1096
01:09:06,434 --> 01:09:08,562
Sally Ann?
Well, terrific.

1097
01:09:08,638 --> 01:09:11,471
In fact, you purchased
the ticket for Miss Cavanaugh.

1098
01:09:11,541 --> 01:09:14,339
Doesn't mean I want her
sitting next to me.

1099
01:09:15,646 --> 01:09:18,979
The flighs full.
She's connecting out of Provo.

1100
01:09:20,083 --> 01:09:22,210
Oh. All right, fine.

1101
01:09:22,286 --> 01:09:24,414
Provo, Spain?

1102
01:09:24,489 --> 01:09:26,150
Utah.

1103
01:09:26,224 --> 01:09:27,384
Utah.

1104
01:09:27,458 --> 01:09:31,224
Frank, don't give me crap
about the beach story.

1105
01:09:31,296 --> 01:09:34,061
- I'm at the airport.
- [Frank] The airport?

1106
01:09:34,133 --> 01:09:36,397
There are two dozen cops
after my ass.

1107
01:09:36,468 --> 01:09:40,030
I can't go home or to the office.
I'm a man without a country.

1108
01:09:40,106 --> 01:09:43,837
If cops are really after you,
come in here. You'll be OK.

1109
01:09:43,944 --> 01:09:46,913
I couldn't
get through the front door.

1110
01:09:46,980 --> 01:09:48,676
I'm going to Utah.

1111
01:09:48,749 --> 01:09:51,217
You go to Utah,
you stay in Utah.

1112
01:09:51,285 --> 01:09:54,686
I'm turning the story over
to a professional reporter.

1113
01:09:54,755 --> 01:09:57,418
The story is Utah.
Trust me.

1114
01:09:57,492 --> 01:10:00,518
You're going to Utah?
Fine.

1115
01:10:00,596 --> 01:10:03,622
If you're story is not on my desk
by 11:30, you're fired.

1116
01:11:33,066 --> 01:11:34,397
Cujo?

1117
01:12:48,416 --> 01:12:50,816
Who the hell are you?

1118
01:12:50,886 --> 01:12:52,514
Get up!

1119
01:12:52,588 --> 01:12:54,180
I'm up.

1120
01:12:55,958 --> 01:12:58,290
- Door was unlocked.
- Lock's busted.

1121
01:12:58,361 --> 01:12:59,692
There you have it.

1122
01:13:00,931 --> 01:13:03,365
I work for the landlord.

1123
01:13:03,433 --> 01:13:06,163
He told me to watch out
for the place.

1124
01:13:06,270 --> 01:13:09,138
- I commend him on his choice.
- What?

1125
01:13:09,207 --> 01:13:11,107
I commend him
on his choice.

1126
01:13:13,845 --> 01:13:15,904
I was supposed to meet
Mrs. Cavanaugh here.

1127
01:13:15,980 --> 01:13:17,141
Who are you?

1128
01:13:17,216 --> 01:13:20,708
I'm Don Corleone,
Mrs. Cavanaugh's cousin.

1129
01:13:20,820 --> 01:13:22,811
You know where she is?

1130
01:13:22,888 --> 01:13:24,287
Moved out.

1131
01:13:24,356 --> 01:13:28,453
Moved out?
Isn't that something.

1132
01:13:28,528 --> 01:13:31,497
I talked to her last week.
She didn't say a thing about it.

1133
01:13:31,565 --> 01:13:33,830
- She moved out.
- You're saying she moved out.

1134
01:13:34,936 --> 01:13:37,234
- This morning.
- This morning?

1135
01:13:37,305 --> 01:13:40,706
God! Uh. We had
so much to talk about.

1136
01:13:42,144 --> 01:13:44,135
Mo Green is out
of the Tropicana.

1137
01:13:44,213 --> 01:13:46,681
My sons, Mike and Fredo,
are taking over.

1138
01:13:46,748 --> 01:13:49,774
What did you
want under the bed?

1139
01:13:52,922 --> 01:13:56,722
I have to pull rank on you.
I didn't want to have to do this.

1140
01:13:56,793 --> 01:14:00,787
I'm with the mattress police.
There are no tags on these mattresses.

1141
01:14:02,499 --> 01:14:04,933
I'm taking you downtown.
Give me the weapon.

1142
01:14:06,170 --> 01:14:08,366
I'm calling the cops.

1143
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:12,035
- This is for the cops.
- Come on, man. I'm her cousin.

1144
01:14:12,110 --> 01:14:13,475
Tell the cops.

1145
01:14:17,283 --> 01:14:20,912
OK. You wanna call the cops,
call the cops.

1146
01:14:22,088 --> 01:14:24,387
Better tie
your shoelaces first.

1147
01:14:46,815 --> 01:14:47,804
Thanks a lot!

1148
01:14:56,861 --> 01:14:58,328
Stretch, whas happening?

1149
01:14:58,396 --> 01:15:01,229
- Got an unbelievable story here.
- Yeah? Great.

1150
01:15:01,299 --> 01:15:03,733
- What can I do?
- Write this down. Sally Ann Cavanaugh.

1151
01:15:03,801 --> 01:15:05,770
Sally Ann Cavanaugh.

1152
01:15:05,837 --> 01:15:08,704
Check every hotel in L.A.
Start near the airport.

1153
01:15:08,774 --> 01:15:11,004
He's supposed to leave the country
with her tomorrow night.

1154
01:15:11,076 --> 01:15:12,634
Got that, honey?

1155
01:15:12,711 --> 01:15:14,771
I love your body, Larry.

1156
01:15:14,881 --> 01:15:19,045
[Pigs Grunting, Squealing]

1157
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:34,031
Good afternoon.

1158
01:15:34,102 --> 01:15:36,002
Howdy.

1159
01:15:36,071 --> 01:15:38,096
They should
recall these things.

1160
01:15:38,173 --> 01:15:41,769
Hit one bump
and the window explodes.

1161
01:15:41,844 --> 01:15:43,402
You're Marvin Stanwyk?

1162
01:15:43,479 --> 01:15:44,946
- Yeah.
- Hi there.

1163
01:15:45,014 --> 01:15:47,643
Harry S. Truman,
Casewell Insurance underwriters.

1164
01:15:47,718 --> 01:15:49,151
Harry S. Truman?

1165
01:15:49,219 --> 01:15:52,382
My parents were fans
of the former president.

1166
01:15:52,456 --> 01:15:55,118
Isn't that nice.
He was a good man.

1167
01:15:55,192 --> 01:15:57,593
- He sure was.
- He showed the Japs a thing or two.

1168
01:15:57,662 --> 01:16:00,688
- Dropped the big one, huh?
- He dropped two big ones on them.

1169
01:16:00,765 --> 01:16:02,824
- He was a real fighter.
- Yeah.

1170
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:05,631
You're in insurance, Harry?

1171
01:16:05,704 --> 01:16:07,365
Thas right.

1172
01:16:07,439 --> 01:16:10,966
- Well, I'm fully covered.
- I don't doubt it, Mr. Stanwyk.

1173
01:16:11,043 --> 01:16:14,605
Actually, my company
sub-insures a policy...

1174
01:16:14,681 --> 01:16:18,117
held by Alan Stanwyk,
who I believe is your son.

1175
01:16:18,184 --> 01:16:19,549
Yeah, he is.

1176
01:16:19,619 --> 01:16:22,111
Mr. Truman,
meet my wife Velma.

1177
01:16:22,189 --> 01:16:24,020
- My pleasure.
- Nice to meet you.

1178
01:16:24,091 --> 01:16:26,855
Sit down and have
a glass of lemonade.

1179
01:16:26,927 --> 01:16:30,364
- Thank you.
- Velma makes the most unusual lemonade.

1180
01:16:30,432 --> 01:16:33,629
Is hard to keep it cold
on a day like this.

1181
01:16:35,604 --> 01:16:37,573
Where you from, Harry?

1182
01:16:38,708 --> 01:16:40,835
I'm from California.

1183
01:16:40,910 --> 01:16:42,844
San Berdoo.

1184
01:16:42,912 --> 01:16:45,780
Yeah. Utah is
part of my route.

1185
01:16:47,184 --> 01:16:51,587
You folks don't mind if I ask you
a couple of questions, do you?

1186
01:16:51,655 --> 01:16:54,090
- Shoot.
- Thank you very much.

1187
01:16:54,159 --> 01:16:56,650
We'll start with
some routine things.

1188
01:16:58,296 --> 01:17:01,129
You and your wife
are currently alive, I take it?

1189
01:17:02,601 --> 01:17:05,161
- Harry, if there's...
- Is just regulations.

1190
01:17:06,806 --> 01:17:10,937
Now, you, Marvin,
and your wife named Velma...

1191
01:17:11,978 --> 01:17:15,914
are the parents of one Alan Stanwyk
of Beverly Hills...

1192
01:17:15,982 --> 01:17:18,177
Executive Vice President
of Boyd Aviation.

1193
01:17:18,251 --> 01:17:20,117
- [Marvin] Check.
- Check.

1194
01:17:20,188 --> 01:17:22,281
And when did you last see Alan?

1195
01:17:23,658 --> 01:17:25,592
Oh... uh...

1196
01:17:25,660 --> 01:17:27,185
about 10 days ago.

1197
01:17:27,262 --> 01:17:28,695
10 days ago?

1198
01:17:28,764 --> 01:17:32,325
He comes and visits
about every three weeks.

1199
01:17:34,036 --> 01:17:37,370
Isn't that nice.
How long has he done that?

1200
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:39,135
Since he moved to L.A.

1201
01:17:43,681 --> 01:17:49,347
Pardon me if I seem a bit personal here.
I don't know how to put it.

1202
01:17:49,420 --> 01:17:54,688
We understand that there's
a young lady friend in Provo...

1203
01:17:54,759 --> 01:17:56,556
that Alan's been seeing.

1204
01:17:56,628 --> 01:17:58,687
Whas this got to do
with insurance?

1205
01:17:58,763 --> 01:18:01,198
This is a comprehensive policy.

1206
01:18:01,267 --> 01:18:03,667
Forget about
that lady friend business.

1207
01:18:03,736 --> 01:18:06,500
Alan is
a loving husband.

1208
01:18:06,572 --> 01:18:08,563
He dotes on his bride.

1209
01:18:08,641 --> 01:18:10,075
Who?

1210
01:18:10,144 --> 01:18:11,839
His wife.

1211
01:18:13,180 --> 01:18:15,648
You've met her?

1212
01:18:15,716 --> 01:18:18,311
Of course we have.
He brings her with him.

1213
01:18:22,390 --> 01:18:25,588
Has Alan ever mentioned
the name Sally Ann Cavanaugh?

1214
01:18:26,495 --> 01:18:28,190
Has he?

1215
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:34,535
Boy, what in the hell's
the matter with you?

1216
01:18:34,604 --> 01:18:36,868
- He has.
- Of course he has.

1217
01:18:36,940 --> 01:18:38,271
Thas his wife.

1218
01:18:40,010 --> 01:18:41,534
Of course.

1219
01:18:41,611 --> 01:18:44,206
His wife's name
is Sally Ann Cavanaugh.

1220
01:18:44,282 --> 01:18:47,308
Cute as a button.

1221
01:18:47,385 --> 01:18:50,354
You wouldn't have
a picture of them, would you?

1222
01:18:50,422 --> 01:18:52,583
We've got lots of pictures.

1223
01:18:52,658 --> 01:18:54,785
- Let me get you some.
- Great.

1224
01:18:56,762 --> 01:18:58,822
Still married are they,
Alan and Sally Ann?

1225
01:18:58,898 --> 01:19:00,263
Yes, they are.

1226
01:19:00,333 --> 01:19:02,392
How long have
they been married?

1227
01:19:02,468 --> 01:19:06,427
It was before
he moved to L.A.

1228
01:19:06,506 --> 01:19:08,498
Eight years April.

1229
01:19:08,576 --> 01:19:10,703
This gets heavier
each year.

1230
01:19:10,778 --> 01:19:14,236
There we are.
Here it is.

1231
01:19:14,315 --> 01:19:16,580
- Thas the one.
- Oh, my goodness.

1232
01:19:16,651 --> 01:19:18,949
She is a button,
isn't she?

1233
01:19:19,020 --> 01:19:20,578
Isn't she cute?

1234
01:19:20,655 --> 01:19:24,217
Could I borrow this picture?
I promise to send it back.

1235
01:19:24,293 --> 01:19:28,195
- Is routine. The actuarial people...
- Thas all right. We have more.

1236
01:19:28,264 --> 01:19:31,358
- Want to see the reception?
- No, thank you. I'm trying to quit.

1237
01:19:31,434 --> 01:19:33,494
How about Marvin's
65th birthday party?

1238
01:19:33,570 --> 01:19:36,664
- How about that, Marvin?
- They got a picture of me in here.

1239
01:19:38,508 --> 01:19:41,672
This is Alan?
I can't believe this!

1240
01:19:41,746 --> 01:19:44,112
Is really Alan,
and is really bigamy.

1241
01:19:44,182 --> 01:19:47,242
- How long have they been married?
- About eight years.

1242
01:19:47,352 --> 01:19:48,444
Who is this woman?

1243
01:19:48,519 --> 01:19:52,149
I think is Alan's
high school sweetheart.

1244
01:19:53,259 --> 01:19:55,090
Sally Ann something or other.

1245
01:19:55,928 --> 01:19:59,365
Alan's been keeping
many secrets lately.

1246
01:19:59,432 --> 01:20:01,024
I'm calling the police.

1247
01:20:01,101 --> 01:20:02,591
No, Gail, don't.

1248
01:20:02,669 --> 01:20:05,935
- I'm calling my father.
- Give me one more day.

1249
01:20:06,007 --> 01:20:09,841
Why? Do you have any idea
how humiliating this is?

1250
01:20:09,910 --> 01:20:12,037
Yes, I do.
I really do.

1251
01:20:14,683 --> 01:20:17,948
Remember what I told you?
Tomorrow night you have a club meeting.

1252
01:20:18,020 --> 01:20:20,989
Stay away from the house.
I'll take care of him.

1253
01:20:21,056 --> 01:20:23,116
- Don't worry.
- She looks like a hooker.

1254
01:20:23,192 --> 01:20:26,491
Look at her. Could you love
someone who looked like that?

1255
01:20:26,562 --> 01:20:28,553
What are you talking about?
Of course not.

1256
01:20:30,033 --> 01:20:32,832
5, 10 minutes tops,
maybe.

1257
01:20:34,238 --> 01:20:35,728
Is funny.

1258
01:20:36,974 --> 01:20:38,703
I know. Listen.

1259
01:20:39,778 --> 01:20:44,579
Why don't we relax and lie down
and I'll fill you in.

1260
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:51,047
This is a good time
to make a pass at me.

1261
01:21:20,522 --> 01:21:23,959
- Gum?
- Who? Go somewhere else.

1262
01:21:24,027 --> 01:21:26,086
Gum, is me.

1263
01:21:27,430 --> 01:21:30,730
- Fletch. Really, is that you?
- Shut up. Don't say my name.

1264
01:21:30,801 --> 01:21:33,793
Shut up. Don't look at me.
I gotta talk to you.

1265
01:21:33,871 --> 01:21:36,066
All right. About what?

1266
01:21:37,843 --> 01:21:40,209
There are cops all around here.
They're after me.

1267
01:21:40,278 --> 01:21:43,406
- You mean those surfers over there?
- Lay back down.

1268
01:21:43,482 --> 01:21:46,213
- Don't point. Just lay back.
- OK.

1269
01:21:46,285 --> 01:21:49,686
- Why they after you?
- I'm a newspaper reporter.

1270
01:21:49,756 --> 01:21:52,623
I'm nailing Chief Karlin as
the major drug source on this beach.

1271
01:21:55,295 --> 01:21:57,320
Sit back.

1272
01:21:58,399 --> 01:22:01,425
Fat Sam's turning
State's evidence.

1273
01:22:01,502 --> 01:22:02,993
Whas that?

1274
01:22:04,105 --> 01:22:06,096
He wrote me
a nice deposition.

1275
01:22:06,174 --> 01:22:08,165
Said he received the drugs
and you did the selling.

1276
01:22:08,243 --> 01:22:11,736
He said what?
Fletch, he's lying.

1277
01:22:11,814 --> 01:22:14,874
I didn't sell nothing.
You gotta believe me.

1278
01:22:14,950 --> 01:22:17,942
I just carried the drugs
from the chief to Sam.

1279
01:22:18,020 --> 01:22:21,457
- Sure you did, Gum.
- Honest, man. Thas all I did.

1280
01:22:21,525 --> 01:22:26,155
20 years in prison, Gum.
Unless you want to play ball.

1281
01:22:30,101 --> 01:22:32,092
You don't leave me
much choice.

1282
01:22:36,475 --> 01:22:38,466
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

1283
01:22:38,544 --> 01:22:42,002
These robes...
I got another question.

1284
01:22:42,080 --> 01:22:44,743
Where does the chief
get his drugs?

1285
01:22:44,818 --> 01:22:46,149
I don't know.

1286
01:22:47,921 --> 01:22:50,446
Have fun.
Don't bend over for the soap.

1287
01:22:50,523 --> 01:22:51,956
Fletch.
Fletch, OK.

1288
01:22:54,462 --> 01:22:56,453
Is somewhere
in South America.

1289
01:23:01,503 --> 01:23:03,437
Mind if I sit here?

1290
01:23:03,505 --> 01:23:04,904
Fletch?

1291
01:23:04,973 --> 01:23:06,565
Man...
[Laughing]

1292
01:23:06,641 --> 01:23:09,475
- You don't know me, Sam.
- My pleasure, brother.

1293
01:23:09,545 --> 01:23:11,410
I'm a reporter, Sam.

1294
01:23:11,481 --> 01:23:14,973
I'm breaking the story
on the drug traffic around here.

1295
01:23:15,051 --> 01:23:16,746
Gummy's turning
State's evidence.

1296
01:23:16,819 --> 01:23:19,186
I got good proof
is the chief.

1297
01:23:19,256 --> 01:23:21,247
You gonna bust the chief?

1298
01:23:21,325 --> 01:23:23,088
Gonna bust the chief.

1299
01:23:25,262 --> 01:23:27,254
I could use your help.

1300
01:23:30,101 --> 01:23:33,093
I'm a slave to that
son of a bitch.

1301
01:23:33,171 --> 01:23:35,402
He busted me,
third offense.

1302
01:23:35,474 --> 01:23:40,036
Said push for him or do 15 long.
All I get from this is free junk.

1303
01:23:40,112 --> 01:23:42,843
- You don't have a piece of the action?
- No. Free junk, thas it.

1304
01:23:48,655 --> 01:23:50,350
Hey, how you doing?

1305
01:23:50,423 --> 01:23:53,587
Albert Einstein's forehead.
You like it? Won it in a raffle.

1306
01:23:53,661 --> 01:23:55,891
Fellas, stay with me.

1307
01:23:55,963 --> 01:23:58,056
Fletch?

1308
01:23:59,201 --> 01:24:00,566
Whas up?

1309
01:24:00,636 --> 01:24:02,797
- I'm quitting at midnight.
- Who are they?

1310
01:24:02,871 --> 01:24:05,840
This is Fat Sam and Gummy.
Come with me.

1311
01:24:05,908 --> 01:24:07,900
Their statements
name Chief Karlin...

1312
01:24:07,977 --> 01:24:10,605
as the number one drug pusher
from here to Oxnard.

1313
01:24:10,680 --> 01:24:13,478
I want them to have Federal protection
sponsored by the paper. OK?

1314
01:24:17,788 --> 01:24:20,382
- This is wonderful.
- I'm out, Frank.

1315
01:24:20,457 --> 01:24:23,517
- You lost faith in me.
- Fletch, I got nervous.

1316
01:24:23,594 --> 01:24:25,790
Forget it.
I'm writing the story.

1317
01:24:25,864 --> 01:24:28,230
Hold the last two paragraphs
till 10:00.

1318
01:24:28,300 --> 01:24:30,768
You want an apology?

1319
01:24:30,835 --> 01:24:33,430
- You were going to can me, right?
- No, not really.

1320
01:24:33,506 --> 01:24:36,964
- Not really?
- I was upset. You know.

1321
01:24:39,779 --> 01:24:42,977
OK. Jesus,
I'm sick of this place.

1322
01:24:43,050 --> 01:24:44,142
Ow.

1323
01:24:44,217 --> 01:24:47,914
I'll try out for the Lakers.
They need a power forward.

1324
01:24:47,988 --> 01:24:50,753
This is a hell of a story.

1325
01:24:50,825 --> 01:24:51,849
Thanks.

1326
01:24:51,926 --> 01:24:54,087
- About these guys...
- They're fine.

1327
01:24:54,162 --> 01:24:57,290
You don't have valuables
in there, do you?

1328
01:27:14,285 --> 01:27:15,809
Good evening.

1329
01:27:22,261 --> 01:27:24,855
I like your outfit.

1330
01:27:24,930 --> 01:27:26,921
Did you bring the 50 grand
and the tickets?

1331
01:27:26,999 --> 01:27:28,934
Of course.

1332
01:27:29,002 --> 01:27:32,199
Oh, oh, oh. You forgot
your rubber gloves.

1333
01:27:32,272 --> 01:27:34,763
You're planning
on killing me, aren't you?

1334
01:27:37,078 --> 01:27:39,672
You catch on real quick,
Mr. Nugent.

1335
01:27:39,747 --> 01:27:41,874
Thas a hostile thing to do.

1336
01:27:41,949 --> 01:27:46,080
You were gonna kill me.
I look at this as self-defense.

1337
01:27:46,155 --> 01:27:50,182
Now, if you would be so kind
as to put your passport on my desk.

1338
01:27:54,230 --> 01:27:56,892
You're wearing my suit.
Where did you get that?

1339
01:27:58,301 --> 01:28:01,294
Where did you get my suit,
Mr. Nugent?

1340
01:28:01,372 --> 01:28:04,170
The name's Fletcher.
I'm a newspaper reporter.

1341
01:28:04,241 --> 01:28:06,334
I write a column
under the name Jane Doe.

1342
01:28:06,410 --> 01:28:09,903
- What is this?
- Read this.

1343
01:28:09,981 --> 01:28:12,609
- I don't have time...
- Cut the crap.

1344
01:28:12,684 --> 01:28:14,675
Come read this.
I'm not going anywhere.

1345
01:28:28,135 --> 01:28:31,070
Unless my people hear differently,
that letter goes out at midnight.

1346
01:28:40,048 --> 01:28:41,515
Dear Mr. Boyd:

1347
01:28:41,583 --> 01:28:43,643
Alan Stanwyk
murdered me tonight.

1348
01:28:47,156 --> 01:28:50,023
Charred remains found in the Jaguar
are mine, not his.

1349
01:28:51,194 --> 01:28:53,253
Mr. Stanwyk,
using my name and passport...

1350
01:28:53,330 --> 01:28:55,457
boarded Pan Am Flight 306.

1351
01:28:55,532 --> 01:28:57,557
- On arrival, he intends..."
- Pretty hefty.

1352
01:28:59,737 --> 01:29:01,364
Keep reading.

1353
01:29:01,439 --> 01:29:03,930
...with his legal wife...

1354
01:29:04,008 --> 01:29:06,033
the former
Sally Ann Cavanaugh..."

1355
01:29:06,110 --> 01:29:07,669
Don't stop, Alan.

1356
01:29:12,718 --> 01:29:15,744
- Uh-oh. The missus.
- What are you doing here?

1357
01:29:15,821 --> 01:29:18,586
I know most of it. I want
to hear the rest from you.

1358
01:29:19,759 --> 01:29:23,320
He doesn't read my stuff very well.
Let me take a crack at it.

1359
01:29:23,396 --> 01:29:26,594
Sally Ann and Alan
were married eight years ago...

1360
01:29:29,103 --> 01:29:31,970
never divorced, making Stanwyk
a bigamist, even in Utah.

1361
01:29:33,108 --> 01:29:35,804
Stanwyk is traveling
with $3 million in cash...

1362
01:29:35,877 --> 01:29:39,142
the result of Gail Stanwyk's
conversion of Boyd Aviation stock."

1363
01:29:44,287 --> 01:29:46,118
Is true, isn't it?

1364
01:29:46,188 --> 01:29:48,122
Sally Ann
can confirm this...

1365
01:29:48,190 --> 01:29:50,182
when the police pick her up
at the Airport Marriott."

1366
01:29:50,260 --> 01:29:52,125
Isn't that where she is?

1367
01:29:53,797 --> 01:29:56,493
By the way,
Alan is a big drug smuggler.

1368
01:29:56,566 --> 01:30:00,003
But you can read about that
in tomorrow's paper.

1369
01:30:00,838 --> 01:30:03,272
Sincerely, I.M. Fletcher.
P.S. Have a nice day."

1370
01:30:04,275 --> 01:30:06,676
Bravo, Mr. Fletcher.
Bravo.

1371
01:30:06,745 --> 01:30:10,511
What tipped me was something your wife
said while we were in bed together.

1372
01:30:14,788 --> 01:30:18,019
Oh?
And what was that?

1373
01:30:18,091 --> 01:30:21,583
She said we had roughly
the same build.

1374
01:30:21,661 --> 01:30:23,687
From the waist up,
I imagine.

1375
01:30:25,866 --> 01:30:27,766
Then I figured it.

1376
01:30:27,835 --> 01:30:29,928
You bump me off,
plop me in the car...

1377
01:30:30,004 --> 01:30:31,495
and burn me up.

1378
01:30:33,442 --> 01:30:36,002
What the heck,
same bone structure.

1379
01:30:36,078 --> 01:30:37,636
You son of a bitch.

1380
01:30:37,713 --> 01:30:40,615
But I'm not a stupid
son of a bitch.

1381
01:30:40,683 --> 01:30:43,243
I was prepared to commit
one murder, assface.

1382
01:30:43,319 --> 01:30:46,755
What makes you think
I won't commit two?

1383
01:30:46,823 --> 01:30:49,725
- Whoops.
- What do you mean, Whoops?

1384
01:30:49,793 --> 01:30:52,387
By the time your story's published,
I'll be on the beach.

1385
01:30:52,463 --> 01:30:56,230
I understand extradition
from South America's complicated.

1386
01:30:56,301 --> 01:30:58,326
For two murders,
is even more so.

1387
01:30:59,404 --> 01:31:01,668
That thing loaded?

1388
01:31:01,740 --> 01:31:03,207
If you shoot me...

1389
01:31:03,274 --> 01:31:05,436
you're liable to lose
those humanitarian awards.

1390
01:31:05,511 --> 01:31:07,206
Tough shit, Hopalong.

1391
01:31:07,279 --> 01:31:08,541
Greetings, everyone.

1392
01:31:10,416 --> 01:31:12,281
Thank God, the police.

1393
01:31:12,351 --> 01:31:14,820
What are you doing here?

1394
01:31:14,888 --> 01:31:17,516
Put the gun down.
I can take care of them.

1395
01:31:17,591 --> 01:31:20,583
Thought you had this figured out.
Nice going, Erwin.

1396
01:31:20,660 --> 01:31:22,925
Don't ever
call me Erwin.

1397
01:31:22,997 --> 01:31:25,591
Fat Sam and Gummy
left the beach today.

1398
01:31:25,666 --> 01:31:30,798
It occurred to me that maybe there are
things happening I should be aware of.

1399
01:31:30,873 --> 01:31:34,206
I'll take care of this.
It doesn't involve you. Go home.

1400
01:31:34,276 --> 01:31:36,210
- I'll call you tomorrow.
- What? Long distance?

1401
01:31:36,712 --> 01:31:39,705
Overheard you say something
about South American extradition.

1402
01:31:39,783 --> 01:31:44,311
Are you taking that $800,000
I staked you with on the next load?

1403
01:31:44,387 --> 01:31:46,447
You two have a lot
to talk over.

1404
01:31:46,524 --> 01:31:49,550
We'll just catch the last
ten minutes of Dynasty.

1405
01:31:49,627 --> 01:31:51,822
[Alan] Jerry,
you're gonna have to trust me!

1406
01:31:51,896 --> 01:31:55,060
I got a way to get rid of this asshole,
and you're jeopardizing everything!

1407
01:31:55,133 --> 01:31:57,226
Your way is gonna land my butt
on the front page...

1408
01:31:57,302 --> 01:31:59,065
while you're basking
in the sun!

1409
01:31:59,137 --> 01:32:00,729
With your money.

1410
01:32:16,490 --> 01:32:18,583
The second one's
going to be more fun.

1411
01:32:18,659 --> 01:32:20,525
Go ahead, make my day.

1412
01:32:46,257 --> 01:32:47,451
Thanks.

1413
01:32:48,893 --> 01:32:50,724
No, this is getting absurd.

1414
01:32:50,795 --> 01:32:53,629
One Bob Haldeman wig,
a gorilla suit.

1415
01:32:53,699 --> 01:32:55,633
- A gibbon suit.
- Tennis shorts.

1416
01:32:55,701 --> 01:32:57,396
leather sneakers,
wrist bands."

1417
01:32:57,469 --> 01:33:00,131
- Is business. I hate tennis.
- Whas novelty teeth?

1418
01:33:00,205 --> 01:33:03,505
Frank, is all business.

1419
01:33:03,576 --> 01:33:05,669
A nun's habit.
Six tubes of Crazy Glue.

1420
01:33:05,745 --> 01:33:07,337
Thas personal.

1421
01:33:07,413 --> 01:33:10,577
- Take it out of my raise.
- You're not getting a raise. Come on.

1422
01:33:10,651 --> 01:33:14,417
I would think the D.A. would need
these tickets for evidence.

1423
01:33:14,488 --> 01:33:15,682
Not necessarily.

1424
01:33:15,756 --> 01:33:17,987
- Not necessarily?
- Larry!

1425
01:33:20,162 --> 01:33:22,357
In the court ruling
U.S. vs. Fishbein...

1426
01:33:22,430 --> 01:33:24,990
a man subjected to
potential incineration...

1427
01:33:25,066 --> 01:33:26,898
while wearing
another man's suit...

1428
01:33:26,969 --> 01:33:28,994
is entitled to $10,000 worth
of airline tickets.

1429
01:33:30,006 --> 01:33:32,668
Is an obscure ruling
but very important one to me.

1430
01:33:32,742 --> 01:33:36,941
Why don't you say that you want
to take me to Rio with you?

1431
01:33:37,014 --> 01:33:40,245
There's a different slant.

1432
01:33:42,252 --> 01:33:44,517
The thing is, we haven't
really dated formally.

1433
01:33:44,589 --> 01:33:46,580
I take first dates
to Laker games.

1434
01:33:46,658 --> 01:33:49,786
I don't want to go
to a Laker game.

1435
01:33:49,861 --> 01:33:51,123
I don't like basketball.

1436
01:33:51,196 --> 01:33:53,961
Maybe thas because
you don't understand basketball.

1437
01:33:54,033 --> 01:33:56,729
You haven't learned the fundamentals.
The pick and roll.

1438
01:33:56,802 --> 01:33:58,736
Sounds like a fast-food chain.

1439
01:33:58,804 --> 01:34:00,796
- Reverse stuff.
- That I've done.

1440
01:34:00,874 --> 01:34:02,967
I'll bet you have,
you little vixen.

1441
01:34:03,043 --> 01:34:05,307
[Fletch] The coroner
had certified Stanwyk dead...

1442
01:34:05,378 --> 01:34:07,539
or extremely sleepy.

1443
01:34:07,614 --> 01:34:11,244
And Chief Karlin was facing
20 years in the fun house.

1444
01:34:11,319 --> 01:34:13,310
I decided
to accompany Gail to Rio...

1445
01:34:13,387 --> 01:34:16,185
and personally assist her
in her grief therapy.

1446
01:34:16,257 --> 01:34:19,853
On the beach, I explained basketball
to her, but she didn't grasp it.

1447
01:34:19,928 --> 01:34:22,055
- Fletch?
- Call me Erwin.

1448
01:34:22,130 --> 01:34:25,123
[Gail Laughs]

1449
01:34:25,201 --> 01:34:27,465
Why do they bounce
the ball the whole time?

1450
01:34:27,537 --> 01:34:30,199
Doesn't it seem
a little childish?

1451
01:34:30,273 --> 01:34:32,571
Well, it may seem that,
but thas called dribbling.

1452
01:34:32,642 --> 01:34:35,203
- Dribbling?
- If they stop bouncing the ball...

1453
01:34:35,279 --> 01:34:37,008
they get called for traveling.

1454
01:34:37,081 --> 01:34:39,311
Traveling. Aha.

1455
01:34:39,383 --> 01:34:41,579
Thas what they call it
when you don't bounce the ball.

1456
01:34:41,653 --> 01:34:44,281
When it came to basketball,
Gail was a loss.

1457
01:34:44,356 --> 01:34:46,347
But we had our own version
of one-on-one...

1458
01:34:46,424 --> 01:34:50,054
and she thought I was the bravest man
in the world, which I am.

1459
01:34:50,129 --> 01:34:53,724
By the way, I charged the vacation to
Mr. Underhill's American Express card.

1460
01:34:53,799 --> 01:34:55,130
Want the number?

1461
