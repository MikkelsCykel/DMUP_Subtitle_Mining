00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:19,561
Man, what's takin' you so long?
It's cold as a motherfucker out here.

2
00:04:19,654 --> 00:04:21,695
I had to get the last stop.
Quiet, punk.

3
00:04:21,782 --> 00:04:24,905
- I'll shut your hairy ass up, man.
- Come on, man. I'm freezin' my fuckin' nuts out here!

4
00:04:24,997 --> 00:04:26,908
Mush, motherfucker, mush!

5
00:04:33,136 --> 00:04:36,472
Ant, Juanita gave you
some of that pussy yet?

6
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,853
- Man, get out of here, man.
- What?

7
00:04:39,982 --> 00:04:42,439
Man, I thought we was homies, man.
I'm just askin'.

8
00:04:42,694 --> 00:04:45,651
Well, why you gotta be
askin' me all that? I mean...

9
00:04:45,784 --> 00:04:47,659
I'm just lookin' out for you.

10
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:51,788
All I'm sayin', man, fine as she is,
she should be giving you something.

11
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:55,588
I bet you ain't even
smelled the pussy, eh?

12
00:04:55,676 --> 00:04:57,754
You two realize that soon
we're gonna be out of school, right?

13
00:04:57,889 --> 00:05:01,806
- Oh, sure.
- After four long years of that shit, man.

14
00:05:01,938 --> 00:05:05,107
I can't fuckin' wait to get out. That's
all I've been thinkin' about, man.

15
00:05:05,194 --> 00:05:08,399
You know? I just be thinkin' about like
what am I gonna do afterwards, right?

16
00:05:08,491 --> 00:05:11,863
You know, I can dig some travelling.

17
00:05:11,997 --> 00:05:13,873
Nigger, you sound like
you rich or somethin'.

18
00:05:14,001 --> 00:05:17,254
Hear this nigger?
He ain't even got a fuckin' job.

19
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:21,341
- I know.
- Man, you better take your ass off to college, man, I'm tellin' you...

20
00:05:21,473 --> 00:05:23,800
before Uncle Sam grab your ass like
he gonna do this stupid motherfucker.

21
00:05:23,935 --> 00:05:26,475
Oh, bullshit, Skip, man.
Ain't nobody gonna grab me.

22
00:05:26,606 --> 00:05:30,987
Jose, a recruiter
can see your dumb ass a mile away.

23
00:05:31,074 --> 00:05:34,326
Look at you.
You're a recruiter's dream. You a 1-A.

24
00:05:34,412 --> 00:05:37,167
A one-way ticket to motherfuckin'
Vietnam if I ever saw one.

25
00:05:37,251 --> 00:05:40,456
That's why I'm goin' to Hunter College.
You goddam right.

26
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:42,673
I ain't fightin'
no white man's war. Shit.

27
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,681
Them Vietcongs, chongs, whatever
the fuck, ain't done shit to me.

28
00:05:45,766 --> 00:05:48,722
I don't even know
them motherfuckers, man.

29
00:05:48,854 --> 00:05:51,431
And I ain't afraid of no war.

30
00:05:51,568 --> 00:05:53,646
Man, what the fuck you been smokin'?

31
00:05:53,739 --> 00:05:57,490
Look, y'all might think
I'm crazy, but...

32
00:05:57,579 --> 00:05:59,490
I just wanna do somethin'
that's different.

33
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:03,536
Yeah, well, gettin' your
fuckin' head blown off is different.

34
00:06:03,632 --> 00:06:06,255
Hey, man, turn that shit down!
And slow this motherfucker down!

35
00:06:06,386 --> 00:06:09,723
- Ain't nobody in a hurry to go to school.
- Man, leave that shit up.

36
00:06:14,943 --> 00:06:18,445
You know I fucked Monica, right? Her
mama came in, caught us the other day.

37
00:06:18,574 --> 00:06:20,699
Came in, seen my dick,
jumped in the bed too.

38
00:06:20,787 --> 00:06:22,828
- Later on, you chump suckers.
- Ah, fuck you.

39
00:06:22,957 --> 00:06:24,832
- Your mama!
- Punk ass, jivin' around.

40
00:06:24,961 --> 00:06:27,501
- Hey, this is for you, Anthony, right here.
- Close this motherfuckin' door.

41
00:06:27,633 --> 00:06:29,674
It's cold as hell out here.
Sit your nasty ass down.

42
00:06:39,613 --> 00:06:42,152
Oh, hey. How you doin'?

43
00:06:42,284 --> 00:06:44,444
You up kinda early.

44
00:06:44,538 --> 00:06:46,781
Um, I heard your truck.

45
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:49,665
Seems like you hear my truck
every mornin'.

46
00:06:49,797 --> 00:06:53,633
Well, uh, morning
is the best time to study, so...

47
00:06:53,763 --> 00:06:57,098
You should, uh, try workin'
on your first boyfriend.

48
00:06:58,646 --> 00:07:01,139
I'm too busy studyin'
to be worryin' about boys.

49
00:07:03,363 --> 00:07:05,654
Your sister up?

50
00:07:05,743 --> 00:07:09,410
Uh, Sleeping Beauty?
Yeah.

51
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:13,673
Look, uh, tell her I said hey.
See ya.

52
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:21,309
- Good morning, Anthony.
- Oh, hey.

53
00:07:21,395 --> 00:07:26,026
- I thought you were sleeping.
- You woke me up.

54
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:29,281
- Uh, so you goin' to school today?
- Mmm.

55
00:07:29,409 --> 00:07:31,368
I could lay in bed all mornin'.

56
00:07:31,455 --> 00:07:34,328
Oh. See, now...
Now that'd be real nice.

57
00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:38,206
- Don't even think about it.
- Well, look, uh...

58
00:07:38,301 --> 00:07:40,675
I'm gonna get on out of here.
I'll talk to you later.

59
00:07:40,763 --> 00:07:44,182
- Okay.
- See ya.

60
00:07:47,108 --> 00:07:49,814
Keep on pushin'

61
00:07:52,284 --> 00:07:55,073
Keep on pushin'

62
00:07:55,206 --> 00:07:58,993
- I'll be down there later on.
- Got to keep on pushin'

63
00:08:00,298 --> 00:08:02,293
I can't stop now

64
00:08:02,427 --> 00:08:04,302
Hard shoe.
Come here, hard shoe.

65
00:08:04,431 --> 00:08:06,425
Come here, man.
What's up? What's up?

66
00:08:06,518 --> 00:08:09,604
Listen, I want you...
I want you to tell Kirby I want 645.

67
00:08:09,731 --> 00:08:12,190
- Straight, now. Listen. And, uh...
- Straight.

68
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,279
- We've been rollin' here.
- Come on, man. I ain't got time.

69
00:08:14,365 --> 00:08:16,276
- Let me get the money.
- I want you to be back here tonight...

70
00:08:16,369 --> 00:08:19,206
- Man, straighten your hat out.
- With my money, you little motherfucker.

71
00:08:21,127 --> 00:08:23,620
- What's goin' on, baby? - All right,
baby. - All right, cat daddy. All right.

72
00:08:23,756 --> 00:08:26,297
- Hey, Anthony. How you doin'?
- Hey.

73
00:08:26,387 --> 00:08:30,470
You know, you brought me luck the other
day. So look, ten of that's for you.

74
00:08:30,603 --> 00:08:34,390
- See? Now, that's how it goes.
- Hey, now.

75
00:08:34,526 --> 00:08:36,686
- L-I'm gonna use the same number too.
- Don't forget me, man.

76
00:08:36,822 --> 00:08:39,991
What's goin' on?
Hey, what's goin' on?

77
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,909
Hey there, Jellybean.
What's goin' on?

78
00:08:56,357 --> 00:08:58,517
Hey, what's goin' on?
How you been?

79
00:08:58,611 --> 00:09:01,365
Kirby back there?
All right. Cool.

80
00:09:03,536 --> 00:09:06,742
- Go on, get that shot. Get that shot.
- All right, thanks, youngblood.

81
00:09:06,876 --> 00:09:09,368
Hey there, Peanut! What's goin' on?
What's up there? What...

82
00:09:14,932 --> 00:09:16,843
Blood.

83
00:09:18,605 --> 00:09:20,730
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Kirby's back there in the back, man.

84
00:09:20,859 --> 00:09:22,984
Put that in Brooklyn
and get ahold of that fuckin' Spyder.

85
00:09:23,113 --> 00:09:26,235
- Okay, man.
- Hey, brother.

86
00:09:26,326 --> 00:09:28,903
- Aw, man, take them.
- Yeah, yeah.

87
00:09:28,999 --> 00:09:32,702
Here's the numbers and the cash.

88
00:09:35,635 --> 00:09:38,841
- We got five.
- Hubba hubba!

89
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:42,471
Ain't you supposed to be
duck huntin' with your daddy?

90
00:09:42,607 --> 00:09:45,360
Oh, yeah.
We gonna go next weekend.

91
00:09:56,172 --> 00:09:59,793
- Aw, shit!
- Oh, man, Kirby.

92
00:09:59,929 --> 00:10:02,719
Made me miss my shot.

93
00:10:02,851 --> 00:10:04,726
You know these motherfuckers down South.

94
00:10:04,855 --> 00:10:08,226
I wonder if half the time
they believe what they be sayin'.

95
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,271
What's a nigger gonna do?

96
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:14,324
We got blood in this land
from slaves.

97
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:17,500
Been to war. Spilt our blood.
Shit, I been to war. I spilt blood.

98
00:10:17,627 --> 00:10:19,668
Ha! That's right.
Tell 'em, Kirby.

99
00:10:19,798 --> 00:10:21,958
You over there fightin' in Korea.

100
00:10:22,051 --> 00:10:25,637
That's how I got this plastic-ass leg.
Nicky, fix me a drink.

101
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:28,265
Ko-motherfuckin'- rea.

102
00:10:33,239 --> 00:10:35,447
Damn! Mmm!

103
00:10:35,576 --> 00:10:37,700
Never gonna give you up

104
00:10:37,788 --> 00:10:40,162
That's why I had to leave that
motherfucker, because if I'd have...

105
00:10:40,251 --> 00:10:42,875
If I'd have still been down there,
I'd have killed me a motherfucker.

106
00:10:42,964 --> 00:10:46,882
Man, shit ain't gonna change.
What make you think shit gonna change?

107
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:49,553
Nigger, what's your little
narrow ass doin' up in here, man?

108
00:10:51,646 --> 00:10:54,519
Leave that boy alone
and let him shoot.

109
00:10:54,609 --> 00:10:58,991
Aw, Kirby, man, you know he too
goddam young to be up in here, man.

110
00:10:59,118 --> 00:11:01,693
He can outshoot you.

111
00:11:01,789 --> 00:11:03,831
Oh, shit.

112
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,583
Oh, I know you out
your motherfuckin' mind, man.

113
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:11,212
Put your money
where your mouth is.

114
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:18,731
I take your money.
Rack 'em, boy.

115
00:11:22,743 --> 00:11:25,616
- Uh, huh, huh, huh
- Watch this.

116
00:11:25,749 --> 00:11:28,456
I got the feelin'

117
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:30,830
Baby, baby, I got the feelin'

118
00:11:32,427 --> 00:11:34,718
- Yes!
- You don't know

119
00:11:34,848 --> 00:11:37,139
You got my two dollars?

120
00:11:37,228 --> 00:11:39,555
Game ain't over yet, man.

121
00:11:39,691 --> 00:11:41,981
Got the eight ball,
corner pocket.

122
00:11:43,447 --> 00:11:46,236
Oh, man!

123
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,834
Don't run out of here without payin' me
after that boy whup you.

124
00:11:52,964 --> 00:11:55,172
Yeah, at least I will
run out of this, motherfucker.

125
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:57,836
People that owe me money don't pay me,
I take care of 'em.

126
00:12:02,564 --> 00:12:05,734
Man, will you get the fuck off
my motherfuckin' table, please?

127
00:12:07,365 --> 00:12:11,829
- Baby-baby-baby, baby-baby-baby
- Chicken-haired motherfucker.

128
00:12:11,915 --> 00:12:15,037
Ain't no goddam business
bein' here in the first place.

129
00:12:21,264 --> 00:12:23,390
Ooh, missed it by that much.

130
00:12:23,477 --> 00:12:26,564
- Cleanup time.
- You don't never play with me.

131
00:12:28,778 --> 00:12:31,152
Eight ball, corner pocket.

132
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:38,997
Oh! Yes! Game.

133
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:44,844
Hey, that's a good game, Cowboy.

134
00:12:44,974 --> 00:12:47,098
You're a lucky motherfucker,
you know that?

135
00:12:49,064 --> 00:12:52,187
Aw, I wouldn't say luck,
but, you know.

136
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,109
- Just know how to play a little bit.
- Here's the money.

137
00:12:55,242 --> 00:12:59,195
- Give that to Kirby.
- All right.

138
00:12:59,332 --> 00:13:02,206
Uh, wait, wait.
This is two dollars.

139
00:13:02,338 --> 00:13:06,802
See, uh, you bet me, so that means,
uh, you owe me some money too.

140
00:13:08,224 --> 00:13:11,976
Man, fuck you.

141
00:13:12,106 --> 00:13:14,515
Why you gotta cheat?

142
00:13:14,652 --> 00:13:17,608
Man, who the fuck you think
you talkin' to, man?

143
00:13:17,699 --> 00:13:19,990
You know what? I'm gonna tell
everybody around here...

144
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:23,742
when it comes to playin' pool,
Cowboy likes to cheat.

145
00:13:23,877 --> 00:13:26,168
Nigger, I'll kick
your little monkey ass, man.

146
00:13:26,298 --> 00:13:28,292
Oh, man.

147
00:13:28,385 --> 00:13:30,925
Shut your motherfuckin' mouth, man.

148
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,011
I oughta cut you.

149
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:38,318
Little motherfucker. Yeah.

150
00:13:38,403 --> 00:13:42,024
It hurt, don't it?

151
00:13:42,118 --> 00:13:44,955
What the fuck?
What the fuck are you doin'?

152
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:50,381
Get the fuck off of me, man!
Kirby, what the fuck you doin', man?

153
00:13:50,466 --> 00:13:52,710
- What the fuck are you doin'?
- What the fuck are you doin', man?

154
00:13:52,803 --> 00:13:56,851
- Get on out of here!
- You a bad motherfucker!

155
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:59,226
- And don't you come back in here unless you come correct.
- Fuck you!

156
00:14:07,454 --> 00:14:10,126
- You all right, kid?
- Oh, yeah.

157
00:14:10,252 --> 00:14:12,744
Just a little cut, you know.
It's all right.

158
00:14:14,551 --> 00:14:19,015
Yep. You do a real good job
for me with them numbers.

159
00:14:19,142 --> 00:14:21,350
Well, you know, I try.

160
00:14:21,479 --> 00:14:26,276
But, uh, you better be cool.
Don't let your mom and pop find out.

161
00:14:26,364 --> 00:14:28,441
Oh, no way.
I won't do that.

162
00:14:34,837 --> 00:14:36,712
It's for you.

163
00:14:38,093 --> 00:14:42,474
Oh, man. Whoa!

164
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:45,182
- Hey, thanks, Kirby.
- Ain't nothin' to thank me for.

165
00:14:45,314 --> 00:14:49,646
- You earned it.
- Oh. Twenties.

166
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:53,567
Hey, kid, you wanna take
a little run with me?

167
00:14:56,501 --> 00:14:59,338
Yeah, I'll take
a little run with you.

168
00:15:03,847 --> 00:15:06,341
Say, uh, Kirby, where we goin'?

169
00:15:06,435 --> 00:15:08,975
Like I told you,
just a little run.

170
00:15:09,065 --> 00:15:12,353
A run. Okay. All right.

171
00:15:14,366 --> 00:15:17,618
- Wanna drive, kid?
- Who, me?

172
00:15:17,747 --> 00:15:20,323
No, not "me. "
You, motherfucker.

173
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,330
Well, Kirby,
I don't have my licence yet.

174
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:25,176
Aw, shit. Fuck the dumb shit.
You wanna drive or what?

175
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,836
Yeah. All right, I'll drive.
Yeah.

176
00:15:32,106 --> 00:15:34,564
- Pull over here.
- All right.

177
00:15:34,653 --> 00:15:37,062
Come on. Come on.

178
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,905
What you call her, Nellie?
Come on, Nellie.

179
00:15:39,995 --> 00:15:42,535
I call this bitch
whatever I wanna call her.

180
00:15:55,982 --> 00:15:58,820
Listen here.
Keep that motor runnin'.

181
00:15:58,946 --> 00:16:01,189
- I'll just be a minute here.
- Yeah, all right.

182
00:16:26,244 --> 00:16:30,327
- Stop messin' with my gold! - Wait a
minute! - How many times I gotta tell you?

183
00:16:35,469 --> 00:16:39,304
I ain't no motherfuckin'
play toy! I'll kick your ass!

184
00:16:39,393 --> 00:16:43,441
- Get the fuck up!
- You get the fuck up off of Spyder!

185
00:16:43,567 --> 00:16:46,440
No.

186
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:48,697
You got more heart than
your punk-ass old man. Come here.

187
00:16:51,498 --> 00:16:54,454
- Oh, man, Kirby!
- Oh, what the...

188
00:16:54,586 --> 00:16:57,127
Give me my fuckin' leg,
you stupid son-of-a-bitch!

189
00:16:57,259 --> 00:16:59,798
You grabbed the wrong leg,
you stupid cocksucker. Come here!

190
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:02,719
- Get on back in here now, Spyder.
- You asshole!

191
00:17:02,809 --> 00:17:05,303
- I want my motherfuckin' money, hear?
- Easy, Kirby.

192
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,398
- Now! - Easy, man!
- Dumb son-of-a...

193
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:09,901
Give me my fuckin' leg,
you stupid cocksucker.

194
00:17:10,031 --> 00:17:13,403
- I'll fuck you up.
- Get on back down there.

195
00:17:13,538 --> 00:17:17,752
- They gonna call the police.
- I got 15 miles to go now

196
00:17:17,878 --> 00:17:21,831
- Come on. Come on!
- And I can hear my baby callin' my name

197
00:17:21,969 --> 00:17:25,092
Floor this motherfucker.

198
00:17:25,225 --> 00:17:27,101
Floor it.

199
00:17:29,775 --> 00:17:33,478
Now I'll be so glad
to see my baby

200
00:17:33,615 --> 00:17:37,236
And hold her in my arms
one more time

201
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:39,455
Now when I kiss her lips

202
00:17:39,584 --> 00:17:42,706
- I'll turn a backward flip
- You did good, kid.

203
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:45,131
You're almost as good
a getaway driver as me.

204
00:17:45,261 --> 00:17:48,762
Uh, thanks. Say, uh...

205
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:51,308
So you were a getaway driver, huh?

206
00:17:55,529 --> 00:17:59,150
- Son-of-a-bitch!
- What? Wh-What's wrong?

207
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:01,737
- I oughta go back there and kill that bastard.
- Why? What happened?

208
00:18:01,874 --> 00:18:04,164
Motherfucker made me lose
a whole pack of cigarettes.

209
00:18:04,295 --> 00:18:07,667
A pack of cigarettes?
A pack of cigarettes?

210
00:18:07,801 --> 00:18:11,089
I thought maybe you should be
worried about your leg or somethin'.

211
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:15,141
- Oh, that shit's funny to you, huh?
- No, no, it's not funny.

212
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:17,141
I tell you what. The next time
the motherfucker grabs me by...

213
00:18:17,234 --> 00:18:20,606
the wrong leg, I'm gonna use it to kick
his ass between his shoulder blades.

214
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:25,034
- Hey, man, you really did that sucker.
- Yeah, everybody in town...

215
00:18:25,123 --> 00:18:27,451
know I got one leg, and that
motherfucker grab the wrong one.

216
00:18:27,587 --> 00:18:30,673
Me and Kirby, baby. Yeah.

217
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:40,807
- This is wonderful news, Edward.
- Thank you.

218
00:18:40,943 --> 00:18:44,814
All right, all right.
You see, Anthony?

219
00:18:44,951 --> 00:18:48,322
You be thankful you can go to City
College on the financial aid programme.

220
00:18:50,669 --> 00:18:53,458
Yeah, in four years,
you can be just like me.

221
00:18:55,219 --> 00:18:57,629
Just like you?

222
00:18:57,766 --> 00:19:01,516
You can graduate and maybe even
go to graduate school too.

223
00:19:03,024 --> 00:19:06,028
Well, I'll tell y'all one thing.
My mama sure would've been proud.

224
00:19:06,156 --> 00:19:09,610
Never would've believed
I got two college graduates.

225
00:19:12,917 --> 00:19:15,375
You think about what
you're gonna major in, baby?

226
00:19:17,635 --> 00:19:19,962
The Marine Corps.
Uh, Dad, could you pass the salt?

227
00:19:20,055 --> 00:19:22,727
What'd you say?

228
00:19:24,021 --> 00:19:28,770
Thanks. I said
the, uh, Marine Corps.

229
00:19:28,863 --> 00:19:30,821
- I'm... I'm joinin'.
- Marine Corps?

230
00:19:30,908 --> 00:19:34,861
- Yeah.
- Now that's original.

231
00:19:34,957 --> 00:19:36,915
What you talkin' about, Anthony?

232
00:19:37,044 --> 00:19:40,166
I'm talkin' about
I wanna do somethin' else.

233
00:19:40,258 --> 00:19:43,676
I don't wanna go to college.

234
00:19:43,764 --> 00:19:46,637
I'm sick of school.

235
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:51,684
I mean, I don't know why everybody
got this strange look on their face.

236
00:19:51,778 --> 00:19:55,280
- It's my life.
- Yeah.

237
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:57,285
It's your life.

238
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:01,914
Looks like to me
you're tryin' to ruin it, baby.

239
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:09,265
You're an idiot.
You know that?

240
00:20:13,442 --> 00:20:17,942
Dad, I don't wanna go to college.
I'm just not ready for no college.

241
00:20:19,996 --> 00:20:24,329
You always said the marines and fightin'
over in Korea made a man out of you.

242
00:20:26,841 --> 00:20:29,678
I figure I be, you know,
livin' my own life.

243
00:20:31,933 --> 00:20:34,308
I'll talk to your mama.

244
00:20:47,044 --> 00:20:50,546
When your baby and you are tight
and everything is right

245
00:20:50,676 --> 00:20:52,753
- And you is mellow
- Give me that.

246
00:20:52,888 --> 00:20:55,297
There you go.
Now, drink some wine.

247
00:20:55,392 --> 00:20:57,386
You keep everything all right

248
00:20:57,521 --> 00:21:00,275
And you know that
you're the only fellow

249
00:21:02,739 --> 00:21:04,614
Ain't that a groove

250
00:21:06,579 --> 00:21:08,538
Ain't that a groove

251
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:12,461
Ain't that a groove

252
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:14,549
Told your little ass
you couldn't drink with me.

253
00:21:14,635 --> 00:21:17,211
- Ain't that a groove
- Hey, James. Want some of this?

254
00:21:17,348 --> 00:21:19,556
- Now, lookee here, fella
- Yeah! Whoo!

255
00:21:19,644 --> 00:21:23,312
Girls like to be in the mood
whenever they think their man is yellow

256
00:21:23,442 --> 00:21:26,565
- Whoo! Yeah!
- Hit me, baby

257
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:31,661
Say, Skeeter, I still can't
believe you graduated, man.

258
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:34,878
- Man, shut up.
- Glad we out of school, man.

259
00:21:34,963 --> 00:21:37,456
I'm sick of these
stupid-ass brothers.

260
00:21:37,593 --> 00:21:39,587
I'm about to get
my pimp thing on started.

261
00:21:39,721 --> 00:21:42,261
You know, I got so many ho's now, man,
I gotta get an assistant pimp...

262
00:21:42,393 --> 00:21:45,396
just to keep in track of 'em, you know,
make sure they on the right streets and shit.

263
00:21:45,482 --> 00:21:49,399
Say, Skippy, why... why you always talkin'
about this pimp stuff, man? What's happenin'?

264
00:21:49,489 --> 00:21:52,326
'Cause it's real, man. I'm a pimp.
Pimpin' run in my family.

265
00:21:52,452 --> 00:21:55,076
My great-great granddaddy was a slave,
and he was a pimp.

266
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:58,918
He used to have his ho's pick his cotton
in the field. He didn't have to do shit.

267
00:21:59,006 --> 00:22:01,464
You better be careful, man. You're
gonna catch something, Skip. Watch.

268
00:22:01,594 --> 00:22:04,598
That's all right, motherfucker. I was
born by the pussy, I'll die by the pussy.

269
00:22:04,683 --> 00:22:06,594
Don't worry about
what the fuck I do.

270
00:22:06,687 --> 00:22:08,598
Hey, Skip, do you
believe in superstition?

271
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:11,479
Hell, no.

272
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:16,319
Well, you should, man.
Your stupid ass jinxed me.

273
00:22:16,453 --> 00:22:20,122
- What the fuck you talkin' about?
- Uncle Sam, man.

274
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:23,333
Dropped a motherfuckin' 1-A on me.

275
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:25,336
I told you, didn't I?
Didn't I tell you?

276
00:22:25,428 --> 00:22:27,838
- Say, when did that happen?
- Last week, Anthony, man.

277
00:22:27,974 --> 00:22:30,764
Yeah, right, motherfucker.
Pass the joint.

278
00:22:33,276 --> 00:22:35,317
- Anthony, man.
- What?

279
00:22:35,405 --> 00:22:38,859
You know that, um,
that me and Marisol, we tight, man.

280
00:22:38,953 --> 00:22:41,161
Yeah, man, y'all are...
Y'all pretty down.

281
00:22:41,248 --> 00:22:43,457
- You would say I love her?
- I don't know.

282
00:22:43,586 --> 00:22:45,545
I could say that you love her.

283
00:22:45,631 --> 00:22:48,254
- I'm thinkin' about marrying her, man.
- Oh, wait a minute.

284
00:22:48,386 --> 00:22:52,517
- Hey, don't do that shit.
- Hey, man, you might be goin' a little too fast now.

285
00:22:52,601 --> 00:22:57,232
Hey, I love her, man, and did you see
how she looks today at that party, man?

286
00:22:57,361 --> 00:23:00,566
- She looks good enough to marry.
- I'm glad to hear you want me.

287
00:23:04,039 --> 00:23:05,914
What you over here
talkin' about, Anthony?

288
00:23:06,042 --> 00:23:09,130
- Why you standin' over here?
- Shut up, Skippy. - Shut up.

289
00:23:12,345 --> 00:23:15,931
Anthony, I know you ain't gonna stay over
here talkin' to Skip while my song's playin'.

290
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:18,725
Not if they expect to be
with us tonight.

291
00:23:20,693 --> 00:23:22,771
- Look here, Skippy, we gonna have to cut on out, bro.
- Uh, yeah.

292
00:23:22,906 --> 00:23:25,197
- Man, where y'all goin'?
- Uh, we gonna go hang on out.

293
00:23:25,327 --> 00:23:27,369
- Look it, have some chicken. - I thought we
was hangin', man. - Have some chicken, man.

294
00:23:27,498 --> 00:23:30,833
I told you about them broads,
old punk-ass.

295
00:23:30,962 --> 00:23:33,538
And anyway, Skip,
Brenda lookin' for you.

296
00:23:33,675 --> 00:23:37,297
I don't give a fuck. You tell her I'm
at where I at and I'll be where I be.

297
00:23:37,391 --> 00:23:41,688
Motherfuckin' pimp. If I gotta go where
every ho want me to be, I be confused.

298
00:23:41,815 --> 00:23:43,940
Motherfucker. Tell her
don't make me hurt my hand again.

299
00:23:44,027 --> 00:23:50,865
If you want a do-right all day

300
00:23:50,998 --> 00:23:52,873
Woman

301
00:23:55,423 --> 00:23:59,471
You gotta be a do-right

302
00:23:59,555 --> 00:24:01,348
All night

303
00:24:01,475 --> 00:24:04,395
Jose, I love you.

304
00:24:06,692 --> 00:24:09,482
I love you too, mama.

305
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:12,244
If you give my pussy away
to somebody else...

306
00:24:12,369 --> 00:24:14,328
while I'm gone...

307
00:24:14,415 --> 00:24:17,917
I'm gonna come back
and blow that motherfucker up.

308
00:24:19,089 --> 00:24:22,378
I got this itch
I need to be scratched.

309
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:33,022
S- S-S-So... So you're sayin'
that y-your, your mama...

310
00:24:33,115 --> 00:24:35,025
is workin' a night shift tonight?

311
00:24:35,118 --> 00:24:38,573
Mm-hmm.
And you know what else?

312
00:24:38,708 --> 00:24:41,546
You could scratch it
all night long if you want to.

313
00:24:45,136 --> 00:24:48,722
You know I'm the nigger. I'm the nigger.
You know I'm the nigger. I'm the nigger.

314
00:24:48,893 --> 00:24:51,302
You swear Big Bertha
won't get off work early?

315
00:24:51,439 --> 00:24:54,526
She's not gonna get off
from work early.

316
00:24:54,653 --> 00:24:56,813
- You scared?
- No, I ain't scared. I just don't...

317
00:24:56,949 --> 00:24:59,525
You act like you're scared.
Come on. Shut up.

318
00:25:00,664 --> 00:25:02,872
- Where Delilah at?
- She in her room. Come on!

319
00:25:08,011 --> 00:25:11,133
- Say it loud
- I'm black and I'm proud

320
00:25:11,266 --> 00:25:13,225
- Get out.
- Say it loud

321
00:25:13,353 --> 00:25:16,143
- I'm black and I'm proud
- Go to your own room.

322
00:25:16,234 --> 00:25:20,235
- Say it loud
- I'm black and I'm proud

323
00:25:24,957 --> 00:25:29,089
Once upon a time
I almost lost my mind

324
00:25:29,215 --> 00:25:30,841
I was lonely

325
00:25:33,514 --> 00:25:37,100
So lonely

326
00:25:37,229 --> 00:25:40,067
Once upon a time

327
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:44,360
Oh, Juanita.

328
00:25:44,451 --> 00:25:46,825
Look, it's okay.

329
00:25:46,913 --> 00:25:49,953
It's all right.
It's okay.

330
00:25:50,086 --> 00:25:52,875
- Okay. Okay.
- Let me get your bra.

331
00:25:52,966 --> 00:25:54,877
- Okay.
- Let me get it.

332
00:25:57,682 --> 00:26:01,304
- Ow. Just unhook it. Just unhook the...
- I can't. I can't.

333
00:26:01,439 --> 00:26:04,526
I'll get it.
I'll do it. I'll do it.

334
00:26:04,612 --> 00:26:06,855
- Okay. Okay.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

335
00:26:06,949 --> 00:26:10,653
Don't peek. Don't look at...
Don't look at me. Okay.

336
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:13,365
Okay. Okay.

337
00:26:15,548 --> 00:26:17,423
- Oh!
- What?

338
00:26:17,551 --> 00:26:21,968
That's not it.
Up, up, up, up. Higher. Ow.

339
00:26:22,102 --> 00:26:24,642
- That's too high. Wait. Down, down.
- Okay, wait.

340
00:26:24,773 --> 00:26:27,776
- Right there? Okay.
- Yeah.

341
00:26:27,903 --> 00:26:31,275
- Okay. Okay.
- All right.

342
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:35,493
- It's okay.
- Uh-oh. Wait.

343
00:26:35,625 --> 00:26:40,041
Okay. Easy. Ow!

344
00:26:40,176 --> 00:26:42,050
Ah!

345
00:27:08,393 --> 00:27:12,263
Oh, shit. Wait, wait, wait.

346
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,103
- Oh, shit.
- Okay.

347
00:27:16,239 --> 00:27:18,864
- Okay.
- Baby.

348
00:27:18,953 --> 00:27:22,289
You know, Marisol and Jose
goin' down to city hall tomorrow.

349
00:27:22,418 --> 00:27:24,958
Oh, yeah? What for?

350
00:27:25,089 --> 00:27:26,964
To get married.

351
00:27:28,804 --> 00:27:31,558
- Is that right?
- What you think about that?

352
00:27:34,063 --> 00:27:35,938
Nothin', I guess.

353
00:27:37,069 --> 00:27:40,607
So I guess you don't want me
to wait for you either.

354
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:43,662
Look, Juanita,
I didn't say that.

355
00:27:43,789 --> 00:27:46,497
So then you're gonna marry me
when you get back?

356
00:27:49,341 --> 00:27:51,964
I mean, if you
ain't got somebody else.

357
00:27:54,099 --> 00:27:56,723
I don't want nobody else.

358
00:27:59,108 --> 00:28:02,064
Juanita, have you
ever thought maybe...

359
00:28:03,825 --> 00:28:07,576
maybe I might get hurt out there
and never come back?

360
00:28:07,665 --> 00:28:11,037
You know, I don't want
you waitin' for nothin'.

361
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:16,087
You're not scared of losing me?

362
00:28:17,349 --> 00:28:20,686
I didn't say that either.

363
00:28:20,814 --> 00:28:22,689
I'm scared of losing you.

364
00:28:30,874 --> 00:28:35,872
So, do you think we could probably
do it one more time before I go?

365
00:28:36,007 --> 00:28:37,883
Uh-huh.

366
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:56,160
Oh, no.

367
00:28:59,425 --> 00:29:01,882
- It's Ma!
- Shh! But it's just 6:30!

368
00:29:02,012 --> 00:29:05,716
- She just pulled up.
- Well, go stall her. And close my door!

369
00:29:05,811 --> 00:29:07,852
- Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!
- Oh, man.

370
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:10,729
I shouldn't have never messed around
with you in the first place.

371
00:29:10,861 --> 00:29:12,902
- Right. - You know Bertha
gonna kill us. - Wait a minute.

372
00:29:13,032 --> 00:29:15,027
- Uh-uh. Ain't gonna wait no minute.
Would you move? - Wait a minute!

373
00:29:17,457 --> 00:29:19,416
Come on. Let me help you
with them packages.

374
00:29:20,545 --> 00:29:22,420
- Delilah!
- I got it.

375
00:29:22,549 --> 00:29:24,923
Girl, you got my good groceries
all on the ground.

376
00:29:25,012 --> 00:29:28,099
Pick those up.

377
00:29:28,184 --> 00:29:31,104
Since I work, the least you girls
could do is keep this place clean.

378
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,288
You know I'm gonna
wait for you, Anthony.

379
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,951
Juanita, I gotta go.

380
00:30:15,477 --> 00:30:17,353
I gotta go, Juanita.

381
00:30:19,693 --> 00:30:23,564
- Nigger, get out of my yard!
- Fuck you!

382
00:30:27,541 --> 00:30:29,416
Shut up!

383
00:30:30,754 --> 00:30:32,665
What's your status? Over.

384
00:30:44,612 --> 00:30:47,070
Shit.

385
00:30:47,158 --> 00:30:50,079
Head for the rally point!
Get back to the rally point!

386
00:30:52,293 --> 00:30:54,371
Get the fuck outta here!

387
00:30:59,055 --> 00:31:01,762
Let's go! Pick it up!
Pick it up! Come on! Come on!

388
00:31:01,894 --> 00:31:05,229
Come on! Move!
Move! Let's go!

389
00:31:05,316 --> 00:31:08,070
Load 'em up! Load 'em up!

390
00:31:11,493 --> 00:31:14,450
Oh, fuck!
I'm out of ammo!

391
00:31:14,583 --> 00:31:17,289
- Devaughn! Cover me!
- Stay down!

392
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:21,298
I got him! Hurry up!

393
00:31:23,598 --> 00:31:26,555
Don't check out on us, Martin. You're gonna
be all right. You're gonna be all right.

394
00:31:26,688 --> 00:31:29,607
- I got him!
- Cover fire!

395
00:31:31,029 --> 00:31:34,317
Goddam it! They got us pinned down!
We'll never make the rally point!

396
00:31:36,455 --> 00:31:38,829
Dugan!

397
00:31:38,918 --> 00:31:42,586
You think it's time we get these
fucking dinks off our asses? Huh?

398
00:31:42,716 --> 00:31:44,592
- Relax.
- Fuck you!

399
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,056
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you!

400
00:31:48,185 --> 00:31:51,472
Radio, up!

401
00:31:51,565 --> 00:31:54,189
God don't like dinks.

402
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:58,494
- How's he doin', Curtis?
- Thanks. Thanks for not leavin' me, man.

403
00:31:58,578 --> 00:32:01,830
- Where the fuck is that radio? Get that radio up here!
- No, no, no, no, no.

404
00:32:01,918 --> 00:32:04,589
Radio comin'! Radio comin'!

405
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:08,051
Get that cover fire, Ferguson.
You wanna die, boy?

406
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,308
Sir, sir! Lieutenant!
Arty freak!

407
00:32:14,941 --> 00:32:18,526
Hammerhead, Hammerhead. Recon Cobra.
Emergency fire mission. Over.

408
00:32:19,574 --> 00:32:21,901
Hold on, brother. Come on.
Come on, come on.

409
00:32:21,995 --> 00:32:24,073
You gonna make it, dude.
You only got a little longer.

410
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:26,961
- You gonna make it.
- Grid five, seven, one-niner.

411
00:32:27,087 --> 00:32:30,755
- Tell my mama...
- No, no, I don't...

412
00:32:35,936 --> 00:32:38,691
Gooks in the bush.
Request firecracker salvo. Will adjust.

413
00:32:38,817 --> 00:32:40,692
How copy? Over.

414
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:43,776
Roger. Solid copy.
Firecracker shot out.

415
00:32:43,909 --> 00:32:46,485
Incoming!

416
00:32:46,623 --> 00:32:49,578
Down! Down! Down!

417
00:32:49,669 --> 00:32:52,043
Curtis, get down!
Curtis, get down!

418
00:33:33,748 --> 00:33:36,538
Out-fucking-standing job.

419
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:39,839
Saddle up. Let's get to the rally point,
take that whirlybird home.

420
00:33:39,926 --> 00:33:43,629
- We got some beer to drink.
- We goin' to the rally point now?

421
00:33:47,398 --> 00:33:50,651
The mission's been compromised.
We're goin' to site 37.

422
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,739
It ain't compromised no more.

423
00:33:53,826 --> 00:33:56,865
They're dead.
Now this is Sneaky Pete.

424
00:33:56,957 --> 00:34:00,458
Reconnaissance.
Some of them dead gooks...

425
00:34:00,588 --> 00:34:03,591
they could have important
intelligence papers on their bodies.

426
00:34:07,308 --> 00:34:09,635
All right.

427
00:34:09,771 --> 00:34:12,061
- Move 'em out.
- Move out!

428
00:34:14,655 --> 00:34:17,907
Hammerhead, Hammerhead.
Cobra on site of your mission now.

429
00:34:17,994 --> 00:34:22,707
I count ten... say again, ten...
November-Victor-Alpha-Kilo-India-Alpha.

430
00:34:22,836 --> 00:34:27,418
- How copy? Over.
- I copy, one-zero. Good job.

431
00:34:27,511 --> 00:34:30,467
Hammerhead, Cobra. Solid copy.
Good job. Cobra out.

432
00:34:34,733 --> 00:34:38,483
Aw, shit, man! What you doin'?
He already dead.

433
00:34:49,551 --> 00:34:52,174
Motherfucker.

434
00:34:52,263 --> 00:34:54,423
Looks like we nailed us
an officer.

435
00:34:55,853 --> 00:35:01,065
You lucky bastard. You get back to C.P.,
you name your own price, sir.

436
00:35:01,197 --> 00:35:05,328
No way, D'Ambrosio.
I'm keepin' this one.

437
00:35:05,412 --> 00:35:07,905
Been lookin' for one of these
since Cleon and I got here in '66.

438
00:35:08,042 --> 00:35:10,795
Ain't that right, Cleon?

439
00:35:13,385 --> 00:35:15,296
I walked right by that guy.

440
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:18,005
You gotta keep your eyes open.

441
00:35:29,455 --> 00:35:31,615
Oh, man, what the fuck?

442
00:35:53,123 --> 00:35:55,081
You hungry or somethin', Cleon?

443
00:35:56,962 --> 00:35:59,634
Just like you, sir.

444
00:35:59,759 --> 00:36:02,596
I'm collectin' me a souvenir.

445
00:36:07,941 --> 00:36:09,816
Saddle up. We're movin' out.

446
00:36:11,656 --> 00:36:15,573
That's all he's gonna say? You ain't got
nothin' to tell this fuckin' shit, man?

447
00:36:34,738 --> 00:36:38,075
- Man, that nigger Cleon crazy.
- Yeah.

448
00:36:38,203 --> 00:36:40,078
- Did you see that shit?
- I saw it.

449
00:36:40,207 --> 00:36:42,248
- Nigger, did you see that shit?
- Yes.

450
00:36:42,377 --> 00:36:44,834
I heard that nigger's supposed
to be a preacher's son and shit.

451
00:36:44,923 --> 00:36:47,843
He cuttin' off motherfucker's
heads for souvenirs and shit.

452
00:36:47,929 --> 00:36:50,932
Now, if you hadn't flunked out
of Hunter College, pimp daddy Skippy...

453
00:36:51,059 --> 00:36:53,184
you would've missed all this
good shit down in Vietnam.

454
00:36:53,271 --> 00:36:57,402
Kiss my ass, nigger. You the reason
why I'm at this motherfucker anyway.

455
00:36:57,488 --> 00:36:59,398
You didn't tell me 'bout
this recon shit.

456
00:36:59,492 --> 00:37:01,818
- That's 'cause you didn't ask me when you were writin' me.
- Nigger, I didn't have to.

457
00:37:01,954 --> 00:37:04,826
- Shit, I figured it was better than being a grunt.
- It is.

458
00:37:04,959 --> 00:37:08,082
Ant, motherfucker,
we out in the woods all day.

459
00:37:08,215 --> 00:37:10,542
Them motherfuckin' gooks jumpin' out
like Indians every five minutes.

460
00:37:10,636 --> 00:37:13,425
- Man, a nigger ain't made for this shit.
- You thought this was a skate.

461
00:37:13,557 --> 00:37:15,766
Nigger, ain't nothin'
wrong with no skate.

462
00:37:15,896 --> 00:37:18,519
You could just call me
a skatin' motherfucker.

463
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:21,439
I skate my ass right out of here,
they give me a chance to.

464
00:37:23,534 --> 00:37:27,202
- Ain't no shitbirds on my squad.
- Man, what you jivin' about?

465
00:37:43,277 --> 00:37:45,568
Hey. Hey.

466
00:37:45,698 --> 00:37:49,485
Ant. To the Bronx.

467
00:37:49,622 --> 00:37:51,497
Yeah, uh...

468
00:37:51,626 --> 00:37:54,914
to the youngblood
who couldn't be with us today.

469
00:37:55,049 --> 00:37:58,005
- Lance Corporal Martin.
- To Lance Corporal Martin.

470
00:38:06,069 --> 00:38:09,771
- Yes.
- Yo, Ant, man.

471
00:38:09,909 --> 00:38:11,867
What they be puttin'
in your head out here, man?

472
00:38:11,954 --> 00:38:15,372
I mean, you done got into this shit
a little bit too deep, don't you think?

473
00:38:15,502 --> 00:38:19,039
You're in recon now, Skip.
You in deep too.

474
00:38:21,137 --> 00:38:23,178
Man, fuck this shit, man.

475
00:38:23,266 --> 00:38:25,474
- Oh, come on, man.
- Man, this ain't our war, man.

476
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:28,809
Shit, our black ass should be
back in the Bronx where we belong.

477
00:38:28,943 --> 00:38:32,860
Joe-ass got lucky. They sent him
home, gettin' wounded and shit.

478
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:35,621
Heard he wounded his hand
pretty bad, man.

479
00:38:35,746 --> 00:38:38,666
Shit, that's all right, though.
He got out of this shit.

480
00:38:38,794 --> 00:38:41,999
I rather be home with a fucked-up hand
up in some pussy than to be out here...

481
00:38:42,133 --> 00:38:44,092
healthier than
a motherfucker without it.

482
00:38:44,179 --> 00:38:47,265
- Shit.
- Same old Skip. Boy, you ain't changed.

483
00:38:47,392 --> 00:38:49,267
That's right.

484
00:38:49,396 --> 00:38:52,353
You heard from Juanita?

485
00:38:52,485 --> 00:38:54,610
She used to write me a lot
during my first tour.

486
00:38:54,739 --> 00:38:56,982
We got a package for ya!

487
00:38:57,118 --> 00:39:01,830
Turns out, man, before I left,
fucked around and got her pregnant.

488
00:39:03,838 --> 00:39:05,713
- Man, you bullshittin'.
- No, I ain't.

489
00:39:05,842 --> 00:39:08,964
- No shit?
- Dead serious, man. Got a little girl back at home.

490
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:13,353
Oh, man, that's groovy, man. That's
groovy. I can dig it. That's cool.

491
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,391
Hey, dig, man, I know
you got a picture, man.

492
00:39:15,526 --> 00:39:19,064
- Let me see her picture. Shit.
- Can't even look at her, man.

493
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:21,277
Man, what the fuck
you mean, bro?

494
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:23,530
That's your little girl, man.
That's your baby.

495
00:39:23,665 --> 00:39:26,123
You know how I survived
26 months in the bush?

496
00:39:26,211 --> 00:39:30,593
Because I don't think about the world,
Skip. That shit don't exist to me.

497
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,928
I don't give a fuck about anything
or anyone in it...

498
00:39:33,057 --> 00:39:37,853
because the minute I do, I'm a dead man
out here, and you remember that shit.

499
00:39:37,982 --> 00:39:41,520
We'll talk about the world
when we get back.

500
00:39:41,656 --> 00:39:44,113
Yeah, whatever, man.

501
00:39:44,244 --> 00:39:46,368
I'm gonna go get high.

502
00:39:46,498 --> 00:39:50,201
I mean real high. And I'm gonna
get my dick sucked too.

503
00:39:56,934 --> 00:39:58,726
Big dick. Big.

504
00:39:58,854 --> 00:40:01,062
Very, very big.
Can you handle it?

505
00:40:04,572 --> 00:40:08,407
"Hey there, Kirby.
What's happenin' back in the world?

506
00:40:08,495 --> 00:40:10,536
If you hadn't heard,
doin' my second tour. "

507
00:40:12,169 --> 00:40:14,627
- Fire in the hole!
- Fire in the hole!

508
00:40:18,346 --> 00:40:20,590
"We spend most of our time
livin' in the bush.

509
00:40:23,147 --> 00:40:25,272
Kind of numb to
everything out here.

510
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:27,769
Tryin' to keep
my head clear.

511
00:40:27,863 --> 00:40:31,117
Our lieutenant is this crazy
white boy named Dugan from Ohio.

512
00:40:36,295 --> 00:40:38,503
He's good at gettin' us
out of crazy situations.

513
00:40:42,222 --> 00:40:44,846
We got this one wild-ass
brother out here named Cleon. "

514
00:40:44,978 --> 00:40:46,972
Gook fuck.

515
00:40:47,065 --> 00:40:50,650
"His daddy's this big-time preacher, but
you'd never know from his crazy son. "

516
00:40:50,737 --> 00:40:55,534
Now you're good.
Now Jesus loves you.

517
00:40:55,663 --> 00:40:59,000
"He's from Mount Vernon.
Oh, yeah. You won't believe it...

518
00:40:59,086 --> 00:41:01,758
but Skip volunteered
for my unit.

519
00:41:01,883 --> 00:41:03,758
I don't think he's
cut out for recon.

520
00:41:03,886 --> 00:41:09,347
He's always gettin' high and shit,
tryin' to keep his mind off things.

521
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:13,433
Me, I'm just tryin' to take it one day
at a time and do what's right...

522
00:41:14,948 --> 00:41:17,322
whatever that is.

523
00:41:17,411 --> 00:41:19,950
See you when I get
back to the Bronx.

524
00:41:20,082 --> 00:41:21,957
Anthony. "

525
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,835
That fuckin' shit stinks.

526
00:42:38,848 --> 00:42:43,644
I don't wanna pull rank, Cleon, but if
you don't get rid of that fuckin' head...

527
00:42:43,732 --> 00:42:45,856
I don't hear nobody else
complainin' but you.

528
00:42:47,237 --> 00:42:49,696
Well, maybe you should
listen to your team.

529
00:42:49,826 --> 00:42:52,698
Medical advice, Cleon:
You dump that shit.

530
00:42:52,831 --> 00:42:55,870
Hey, Doc, shut the fuck up.
You don't know shit.

531
00:42:55,962 --> 00:42:59,630
Fuck you, man. It stinks like
a sack full of assholes.

532
00:42:59,761 --> 00:43:02,633
Ain't a one of us got as much
as a splinter in his finger...

533
00:43:02,765 --> 00:43:04,760
since I cut this head off.

534
00:43:04,894 --> 00:43:07,387
This head is our
good-luck charm.

535
00:43:08,776 --> 00:43:12,943
Nah, this here's
our good-luck charm.

536
00:43:13,075 --> 00:43:16,245
If you don't mind, Sergeant, I...
My vote is to get rid of it.

537
00:43:16,332 --> 00:43:19,003
Man, Cleon, you need to get the fuck on
with that bullshit, man.

538
00:43:19,128 --> 00:43:22,880
- That head smell like shit.
- Bottom line, Staff Sergeant.

539
00:43:25,013 --> 00:43:28,101
You either get rid of that fuckin' head
A.S.A. fuckin' P., or I'm gonna...

540
00:43:28,228 --> 00:43:32,478
have your ass court-martialed
when we get back to the rear.

541
00:43:32,611 --> 00:43:35,150
We clear?

542
00:43:46,219 --> 00:43:49,138
Cobra, Cobra, Delta six. Over.

543
00:43:49,265 --> 00:43:51,889
Delta six, Delta six, Cobra.
Copy. Over.

544
00:43:52,021 --> 00:43:54,145
Cobra, Delta six.
Execute Charlie, Michael...

545
00:43:54,233 --> 00:43:59,397
We're in a world of shit now.
I just buried our luck.

546
00:43:59,533 --> 00:44:03,285
Listen up. Change of mission.
A patrol from 25 has found...

547
00:44:03,374 --> 00:44:06,876
a shitload of weapons in a vill
about a klik and a half to our whisky.

548
00:44:07,005 --> 00:44:08,881
Platoon commander wants us
to interrogate on the spot.

549
00:44:09,009 --> 00:44:11,882
Betancourt, you're the closest one in
the area that speaks that gook shit.

550
00:44:12,015 --> 00:44:16,347
So that's where we're headin'.
All right, saddle up. We're movin' out.

551
00:44:16,439 --> 00:44:21,235
- So now where's D'Ambrosio?
- He went to go take a shit.

552
00:44:21,364 --> 00:44:24,072
- When?
- When Cleon was diggin' the hole.

553
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:26,078
- Why the hell didn't you go with him?
- You know how he is.

554
00:44:26,207 --> 00:44:29,459
- He don't like nobody around when he's shittin'.
- Oh, man.

555
00:44:29,587 --> 00:44:31,878
Grab his shit.
Let's find him.

556
00:44:40,733 --> 00:44:42,608
Aww.

557
00:44:42,736 --> 00:44:45,609
Fuck! Doc.

558
00:44:45,741 --> 00:44:48,780
- 360!
- D'Ambrosio, what'd they do?

559
00:44:48,914 --> 00:44:52,962
You'll be all right.
Doc's gonna take care of you, okay?

560
00:45:00,810 --> 00:45:03,054
This morphine is all
I can do for him right now.

561
00:45:08,449 --> 00:45:11,654
Here, Doc. You can use mine
if that's not enough.

562
00:45:11,788 --> 00:45:14,827
Are you crazy? Another one of those
would kill him right now.

563
00:45:25,604 --> 00:45:28,144
What the fuck
you got there, Curtis?

564
00:45:28,234 --> 00:45:32,186
Somethin' about
"Black men, go home.

565
00:45:33,493 --> 00:45:35,322
This isn't your war. "

566
00:45:35,455 --> 00:45:38,827
You get rid of that cocksucking
commie bullshit right now.

567
00:45:42,342 --> 00:45:44,551
- Yeah. Right.
- Hey, Curtis.

568
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:47,553
- Apply some pressure here.
- We gotta hump this man back to the rally point.

569
00:45:47,685 --> 00:45:49,561
Oh, shit.

570
00:45:52,653 --> 00:45:54,528
Save me, Curtis.

571
00:45:54,657 --> 00:45:56,734
Look, Adam, you don't
worry 'bout nothin'.

572
00:45:56,869 --> 00:45:59,029
We're a team,
okay, brother?

573
00:45:59,123 --> 00:46:02,042
- We gonna take care of you.
- Please.

574
00:46:02,128 --> 00:46:05,215
Yeah. It's not much longer.
We're almost there.

575
00:46:06,511 --> 00:46:08,386
Kill me.

576
00:46:10,769 --> 00:46:12,644
Kill me!

577
00:46:14,316 --> 00:46:16,810
I would do it
for you.

578
00:46:16,946 --> 00:46:19,237
I would do it
for you, Curtis.

579
00:46:19,325 --> 00:46:21,783
Buttermilk 17.
Cobra, over.

580
00:46:21,913 --> 00:46:26,663
Cobra, Cobra. Buttermilk 17. Inbound
your buzz. Contact on your visual.

581
00:46:26,797 --> 00:46:28,673
- Shh.
- Buttermilk 17. Cobra.

582
00:46:28,801 --> 00:46:31,009
Hey, you gonna be all right.

583
00:46:31,138 --> 00:46:34,474
The medevac will be here
in a minute.

584
00:46:34,602 --> 00:46:36,728
Do it.

585
00:46:40,823 --> 00:46:42,697
You think
I don't mean it?

586
00:46:44,830 --> 00:46:47,916
I can't go home like this.

587
00:46:48,001 --> 00:46:51,290
- Hey, what's he saying?
- He's delirious, man.

588
00:46:57,686 --> 00:46:59,644
- Please.

00:48:22,128 --> 00:48:25,215
It's better to check out

596
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:29,555
No shit.

Look, man, you wear that motherfucker for about

640
00:52:51,485 --> 00:52:53,978
You stay up now, all right?

641
00:52:56,368 --> 00:52:58,528
What's happening, blood?

642
00:52:58,664 --> 00:53:00,539
Hey, man, I'm back.

643

Tell your sister I'm gonna

00:53:15,111 --> 00:53:17,485
Hey, fuck you!

648
00:53:19,368 --> 00:53:23,120
Man, the neighbourhood is changin'.

649
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:26,586
Aw, it's still a good place.
White people movin' out, though.

650
00:53:28,551 --> 00:53:31,508
Oh, dig. I saw Juanita

651
00:53:31,598 --> 00:53:34,601
Man, she finer than a motherfucker.

00:53:34,728 --> 00:53:37,518
Is that right?

653
00:53:37,609 --> 00:53:40,981
You need to go check her out, man.
Go see your little daughter.

654
00:53:41,116 --> 00:53:43,869
Remember them big-ass ears
you had when you was young?

655
00:53:43,954 --> 00:53:47,041
She got 'em, just like you.
That's how I know it was yours.

656
00:53:48,670 --> 00:53:51,674
So, what's up with Joe, man?
Is he, uh... Is he workin' or what?

657
00:53:51,801 --> 00:53:55,672
Aw, post office, you know.
Three-quarter gig, part-time.

658
00:53:55,808 --> 00:53:58,645
He gotta do what he gotta do.
He got mouths to feed, you know.

659
00:53:58,771 --> 00:54:01,182
What about you, man?
How you doin'?

660
00:54:01,318 --> 00:54:03,147
- Who, me?
- Yeah.

661
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:05,820
I'm cool, baby. I'm Skippy, baby.
I'm still pimpin'.

662
00:54:08,831 --> 00:54:11,289
Need any money
or anything, you know?

663
00:54:11,378 --> 00:54:13,953
Man, I got over like a fat rat
when I got out, man.

664
00:54:14,049 --> 00:54:17,635
Dig, I got my school money comin'
from the government once a month.

665
00:54:17,764 --> 00:54:20,387
I got my veteran's cheque
comin' once a month.

666
00:54:20,519 --> 00:54:25,101
I got my fifty percent medical cheque
comin' to me for the rest of my life.

667
00:54:25,195 --> 00:54:28,648
I ain't gotta do a goddam thing else
but go to the mailbox, you dig?

668
00:54:28,784 --> 00:54:31,456
Hey, man, how the hell you pull
a fifty percent medical?

669
00:54:31,539 --> 00:54:33,580
Nigger, you ain't disabled.

670
00:54:33,710 --> 00:54:35,585
Man, some shit got
into me over there, man.

671
00:54:36,881 --> 00:54:38,840
What?

672
00:54:38,927 --> 00:54:42,381
All I know is my blood cells
are all fucked up.

673
00:54:42,517 --> 00:54:45,092
Some nights I wake up
in cold sweats and shit.

674
00:54:46,566 --> 00:54:48,975
Don't look at me like that, man.
It ain't the heroin.

675
00:54:49,070 --> 00:54:52,608
The heroin ain't never did nothin' to me.
A lot of vets comin' down with this shit.

676
00:54:52,743 --> 00:54:55,830
- And they don't know what it is?
- Square biz.

677
00:54:58,253 --> 00:55:03,002
Damn. Look, man, you wanna
come on in the crib or somethin', man?

678
00:55:03,095 --> 00:55:05,470
Nah, man. I'm cool, baby.
Hey, I'm gonna split.

679
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:08,437
But you here, baby. You home.
We got plenty of time to do our thing.

680
00:55:08,563 --> 00:55:10,356
You know what I'm sayin'?

681
00:55:15,367 --> 00:55:17,277
- Brother.
- Brother. Go see your mama.

682
00:55:17,412 --> 00:55:20,250
- Right on. I'm gonna check her out.
- With her fine ass.

683
00:55:20,334 --> 00:55:22,412
You know, I been takin' care
of your mama while you been gone.

684
00:55:22,505 --> 00:55:24,416
Boy, I'll kick your head in.
Don't talk like that.

685
00:55:37,991 --> 00:55:39,569
Mmm.

686
00:55:50,555 --> 00:55:52,430
You all right?

687
00:55:53,811 --> 00:55:55,354
Yeah.

688
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:01,448
Well, can't you look me in my eyes?
I ain't seen you in four years.

689
00:56:10,758 --> 00:56:12,752
Well, what'd you do over there?
What was it like?

690
00:56:12,887 --> 00:56:17,433
Look, uh, I'd rather not
talk about that right now.

691
00:56:17,561 --> 00:56:19,520
Well, Anthony, you gonna have
to tell us something.

692
00:56:19,648 --> 00:56:23,519
Now, you know a lot of them boys went over there
and got hooked on them drugs and stuff. You know.

693
00:56:23,655 --> 00:56:27,491
Look, I was in a special unit
out there...

694
00:56:27,579 --> 00:56:30,073
and bad habits could've cost us
our lives.

695
00:56:30,210 --> 00:56:32,168
Well, that's what I'm talkin' about,
them bad habits, honey.

696
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:36,588
Now, if you picked up some of them things,
there's a lot of places you can go and get help.

697
00:56:36,721 --> 00:56:39,178
No bad habits, Ma.

698
00:56:39,267 --> 00:56:41,842
'Cept a little killin'.

699
00:56:41,938 --> 00:56:43,813
For my country, of course.

700
00:56:45,695 --> 00:56:47,606
Hey. Let me give you some more
of these collards.

701
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:49,402

702
00:57:06,566 --> 00:57:10,353
Oh, shit. Look who back.

Hey, what's goin' on?
Hey, I got next game.

709
00:57:33,030 --> 00:57:35,605

710
00:57:35,701 --> 00:57:39,038

711
00:57:39,166 --> 00:57:42,620
Say, chump.
Don't I know you from somewhere?

712
00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:47,967

716
00:57:56,739 --> 00:57:59,659
Say, man,

717
00:57:59,786 --> 00:58:04,202
Yeah, man. I was in demolitions
and my fuckin' hand gets blown off, man.

718
00:58:04,335 --> 00:58:08,383
- Oh, man. Shit.

721
00:58:15,439 --> 00:58:18,526
Man, hey. You gotta check out Kirby,

722
00:58:18,612 --> 00:58:20,736
Yeah. Let's go on back.

00:58:36,184 --> 00:58:40,055
when she pulled off them drawers,
I thought I'd never stop seein' ass!"

731
00:58:43,865 --> 00:58:47,034

00:58:51,796 --> 00:58:53,671
Youngblood! Come on, boy!

734
00:58:55,553 --> 00:58:59,885
- How you doin'? Come on in the back here, boy. Come on.
- Oh, boy. All right.

735
00:59:04,819 --> 00:59:09,449
Man, I been everywhere
lookin' for a gig.

736
00:59:09,578 --> 00:59:12,997
Aw, motherfuckers forget about you
gettin' your ass almost blown off...

737
00:59:13,126 --> 00:59:14,621
or whatever the fuck.

738
00:59:14,753 --> 00:59:18,505
Yeah. Look, uh, Kirby, uh...

739
00:59:18,635 --> 00:59:21,972
I was thinkin', man.
Maybe, uh, come back and work for you.

740
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:24,938
What? Work for me?

741
00:59:25,022 --> 00:59:28,975
Yeah. You know. Runnin' numbers.
Like we used to do.

742
00:59:29,071 --> 00:59:33,321
Shh. Fuckin' pigs run me
out of business.

743
00:59:33,454 --> 00:59:37,751
How... How the pigs run you outta
business, man? You had 'em on the payroll.

744
00:59:37,878 --> 00:59:39,872
Pigs are greedy.

745
00:59:40,007 --> 00:59:42,167
And you gotta remember I'm dealing
with the NYPD...

746
00:59:42,261 --> 00:59:44,884
greediest, most corrupt pigs
on the face of the earth.

747
00:59:46,727 --> 00:59:48,223
So I got the fuck out.

748
00:59:48,355 --> 00:59:51,478
I told that motherfucker I'd rather
eat cat shit with a knittin' needle.

749
00:59:51,570 --> 00:59:55,405
I wasn't gonna bust my ass sendin'
some cop kids to college. Shit.

750
00:59:56,912 --> 00:59:59,370
I dig it.

751
00:59:59,459 --> 01:00:01,951
This place ain't never
made much money.

752
01:00:02,088 --> 01:00:05,709
So I'm just hustlin' here and there.

753
01:00:05,803 --> 01:00:08,130
Tryin' to get over,
just like everybody else.

754
01:00:12,481 --> 01:00:14,606
It's gonna be all right, kid.

755
01:00:15,613 --> 01:00:18,402
Here's to gettin' over.

756
01:00:18,492 --> 01:00:22,030
I hope, man. Hope. Shit.

757
01:00:24,294 --> 01:00:29,174
- You afraid of blood?
- Uh, that's all I been around for the past three years.

758
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:34,427
Anthony Curtis.

759
01:00:34,521 --> 01:00:37,809
You related to Tony?
The actor?

760
01:00:37,944 --> 01:00:42,277
N- No. Not...
Oh! The act... No, no, no.

761
01:00:42,410 --> 01:00:45,367
- Different colour, right?
- Yeah! He's a white cat. Yeah.

762
01:00:45,499 --> 01:00:49,120
And his name was Schwartz.
Schwartz, not Curtis.

763
01:00:49,214 --> 01:00:52,087
- Okay.
- Know anything about butchering?

764
01:00:52,178 --> 01:00:53,971
Uh, I'm a fast learner.

765
01:00:54,056 --> 01:00:55,967
Here, put that on.

766
01:00:57,438 --> 01:00:59,562
- Here. Take this.
- Need some help, man!

767
01:00:59,691 --> 01:01:01,686
All right.

768
01:01:24,444 --> 01:01:26,485
Hey, uh, is Juanita in?

769
01:01:26,572 --> 01:01:28,946
No, she's not,
but she'll be back in a...

770
01:01:31,122 --> 01:01:33,033
in a while.

771
01:01:35,296 --> 01:01:38,502
So you gonna stand out there,
or you comin' in?

772
01:01:38,594 --> 01:01:40,505
I'm gonna come on in.

773
01:01:43,143 --> 01:01:45,387
Girl, check you out.

774
01:01:50,156 --> 01:01:52,198
I thought you were goin' over
to the communists.

775
01:01:52,285 --> 01:01:55,822
Ah. Nah. Not me.

776
01:01:55,958 --> 01:01:58,451
Now, dig, if you were smart,
that's what you would've done.

777
01:01:58,588 --> 01:02:00,629
What?

778
01:02:00,758 --> 01:02:03,465
Man, you don't know what the hell
you talkin' about, girl.

779
01:02:03,596 --> 01:02:07,680
No, it's cool. I mean it's not your
fault you been brainwashed by America.

780
01:02:10,317 --> 01:02:13,154
I mean, at least you made it back
alive, right?

781
01:02:13,281 --> 01:02:16,653
You know, "Hello, how you doin'?"
That would've been real nice...

782
01:02:16,787 --> 01:02:19,992
before you got off
onto all this political shit.

783
01:02:22,004 --> 01:02:25,008
Welcome home.

784
01:02:25,135 --> 01:02:27,545
And welcome to the revolution.

785
01:02:31,897 --> 01:02:34,936
- So, this is Sarah's?
- Mm-hmm.

786
01:02:36,906 --> 01:02:38,817
Oh, wow.

787
01:02:41,372 --> 01:02:45,789
- So, is she a smart baby?
- Ahh.

788
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:48,124
Why don't you find out for yourself?

789
01:02:50,931 --> 01:02:56,523
Hey, y'all. Sorry I'm late.
Traffic on the Cross Bronx was a mess.

790
01:02:59,363 --> 01:03:03,234
Oh. All righty.

791
01:03:03,370 --> 01:03:05,530
There we go.

792
01:03:05,666 --> 01:03:07,459
There you go.

793
01:03:07,586 --> 01:03:10,079
Go play with your blocks.
Go play with your blocks.

794
01:03:19,983 --> 01:03:21,894
Hey.

795
01:03:32,213 --> 01:03:36,296
Oh, no. Look, Juanita.
I'm in one piece.

796
01:03:41,772 --> 01:03:43,647
Hey, I got somebody
I want you to meet.

797
01:03:43,776 --> 01:03:47,527
Come here, Sarah.
Come to Mommy.

798
01:03:47,658 --> 01:03:51,824
Good girl. Come here.
Look at that.

799
01:03:51,957 --> 01:03:54,532
- That's Daddy. Say hi.
- Hi.

800
01:03:54,670 --> 01:03:56,998
This is Sarah Marie Curtis.

801
01:03:57,133 --> 01:03:59,211
- Hi.
- Hello.

802
01:03:59,345 --> 01:04:02,099
Hold her, silly. She's yours.

803
01:04:02,183 --> 01:04:04,059
Oh.

804
01:04:04,187 --> 01:04:06,596
Hey. Mmm.

805
01:04:10,573 --> 01:04:11,855
Hey, um...

806
01:04:11,993 --> 01:04:15,412
Oh, yeah. Be advised.
What's goin' on, my brothers?

807
01:04:19,048 --> 01:04:22,003
- This is it, huh?
- Yeah. This is home.

808
01:04:22,136 --> 01:04:24,629
Dig it. Dig it.

809
01:04:24,724 --> 01:04:26,552
Check out Sleepin' Beauty
back there.

810
01:04:28,982 --> 01:04:32,068
Boy, I still can't get over
how gorgeous she is.

811
01:04:32,196 --> 01:04:34,106
Oh, she got that from her mama.

812
01:04:34,241 --> 01:04:36,200
Oh. Okay.

813
01:04:39,668 --> 01:04:42,243
You know, Juanita...

814
01:04:42,380 --> 01:04:47,260
I wanna let you know I...
I did miss you. A lot.

815
01:04:47,390 --> 01:04:49,847
Don't you think I know that, Anthony?

816
01:04:49,936 --> 01:04:53,806
It's not important anyway. The important
thing is that you're here now.

817
01:04:53,943 --> 01:04:56,317
Shh. Come here.

818
01:04:57,658 --> 01:04:59,403
Oh.

819
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:18,477
Hey, baby girl.

820
01:05:18,612 --> 01:05:20,939
Hey, Cutty.

821
01:05:23,287 --> 01:05:25,780
Came by to see you a little earlier,
but you weren't home.

822
01:05:28,671 --> 01:05:30,381
Oh, you know I had class tonight
after work...

823
01:05:30,508 --> 01:05:32,633
and then I stopped over by my mother's.

824
01:05:35,434 --> 01:05:38,009
- Oh, yeah. I forgot. It's Saturday.
- Yeah.

825
01:05:39,148 --> 01:05:41,642
I see my little girl's sleepin'
back there, huh?

826
01:05:41,737 --> 01:05:44,656
Yeah. She's all played out.

827
01:05:47,998 --> 01:05:51,452
- Cutty, I wanted you to meet, um...
- Look here.

828
01:05:51,546 --> 01:05:54,039
- Got a little somethin' for Sarah.
- Smiling faces

829
01:05:54,176 --> 01:05:59,007
- Buy her something real nice.
- Smiling faces sometimes

830
01:05:59,101 --> 01:06:01,855
Hey, Cutty, I told you
to stop spoilin' her like this.

831
01:06:01,981 --> 01:06:04,308
Smiling faces

832
01:06:04,402 --> 01:06:07,988
Smiling faces tell lies

833
01:06:08,076 --> 01:06:11,530
- Somebody's gotta do it.
- And I got proof

834
01:06:11,666 --> 01:06:15,749
- Beware
- Cutty, I want you to meet Anthony.

835
01:06:21,015 --> 01:06:23,805
Okay. All right.

836
01:06:23,937 --> 01:06:26,940
Let me just put her to bed. You come on
in and make yourself at home.

837
01:06:27,067 --> 01:06:28,943
Come on in.

838
01:06:53,281 --> 01:06:56,071
Okay. Can I get you something
to drink, or...

839
01:06:56,162 --> 01:06:59,783
Look, Juanita.
Uh, I think I better go.

840
01:06:59,919 --> 01:07:02,079
But you just got here.

841
01:07:02,172 --> 01:07:05,924
Who knows, you could be
expectin' company or something.

842
01:07:06,013 --> 01:07:08,340
Nobody's comin' here, Anthony.

843
01:07:08,475 --> 01:07:10,351
I think I still should go.

844
01:07:15,362 --> 01:07:17,771
Anthony.

845
01:07:17,866 --> 01:07:20,325
I used to see Cutty.
Is that what you wanna hear?

846
01:07:20,413 --> 01:07:23,202
Oh. Blood made that very clear to me.

847
01:07:23,335 --> 01:07:25,412
So then, what's the problem?

848
01:07:25,547 --> 01:07:27,837
Problem?

849
01:07:27,927 --> 01:07:31,843
Why, man throwed two yards on your car.

850
01:07:31,933 --> 01:07:35,103
You askin' me what's the problem?
Shit. Obviously nothin'.

851
01:07:35,231 --> 01:07:37,190
Don't come up in here judgin' me.

852
01:07:37,318 --> 01:07:39,989
What the fuck, man?
You got a pimp around my daughter?

853
01:07:40,074 --> 01:07:41,866
Oh, he is not a pimp.

854
01:07:41,993 --> 01:07:44,202
And besides, if you cared anything
about havin' a daughter...

855
01:07:44,331 --> 01:07:46,906
you'd have wrote me back
after I sent you our picture.

856
01:07:47,044 --> 01:07:49,085
But don't jump on me
for havin' a life.

857
01:07:49,214 --> 01:07:51,505
You didn't want one with me.

858
01:07:53,389 --> 01:07:56,642
So now what?

859
01:07:56,770 --> 01:07:59,726
Are you gonna leave?

860
01:07:59,858 --> 01:08:01,734
Some bullshit.

861
01:08:09,334 --> 01:08:11,375
Come here.

862
01:08:11,463 --> 01:08:14,134
Come on. Come here.

863
01:08:26,991 --> 01:08:28,901
Ooh, hey

864
01:08:30,455 --> 01:08:33,126
Ya gotta, gotta payback
Payback

865
01:08:33,252 --> 01:08:35,460
- Damn!
- Revenge

866
01:08:41,183 --> 01:08:43,889
A man
The big payback

867
01:08:44,021 --> 01:08:45,979
Got to get back

868
01:08:46,108 --> 01:08:48,316
Cleanup time, Cowboy.

869
01:08:48,446 --> 01:08:51,899
See, man, why the fuck
you always gotta talk some shit?

870
01:08:52,035 --> 01:08:55,573
Payback
Right there

871
01:08:55,708 --> 01:08:58,831
- See, that's why I kicked his fuckin' ass when he was a little kid, man.
- Payback

872
01:08:58,923 --> 01:09:02,758
- Always gettin' smart and shit.
- A man

873
01:09:02,888 --> 01:09:05,381
Get down with my girlfriend

874
01:09:06,770 --> 01:09:09,477
That ain't right

875
01:09:09,608 --> 01:09:12,231
Now you gonna play this marine
war hero.

876
01:09:12,363 --> 01:09:14,524
Out of touch

877
01:09:14,618 --> 01:09:16,742
You know what I think?

878
01:09:16,872 --> 01:09:19,578
- I think y'all was some goddam fools goin' over there...
- Gonna fight

879
01:09:19,710 --> 01:09:22,285
fightin' that white man's war.

880
01:09:22,422 --> 01:09:25,426
- That's right.
- Payback everything you got to see

881
01:09:25,512 --> 01:09:28,718
- What you got when you get back here, huh?
- Yeah

882
01:09:28,810 --> 01:09:31,302
- Never do any damn thing
- Not a goddam thing.

883
01:09:34,152 --> 01:09:36,906
Course, you do got
that fine-ass Juanita.

884
01:09:36,991 --> 01:09:40,278
- Throw me out
- Now, what the fuck you lookin' at me like that for, man?

885
01:09:40,413 --> 01:09:41,957
I'm just complimentin' you
on your taste.

886
01:09:42,083 --> 01:09:46,629
Throw me away
You had all the rage

887
01:09:46,717 --> 01:09:49,839
- You had me down
- Course you know...

888
01:09:49,972 --> 01:09:52,050
- That's the facts
- Baddest motherfucker this side of Nicky Barnes...

889
01:09:52,184 --> 01:09:54,511
- Now, you punk
- My boss man Cutty...

890
01:09:54,647 --> 01:09:57,187
Gettin' ready for the big payback

891
01:09:57,319 --> 01:09:59,147
I thought that might ring a bell.

892
01:09:59,281 --> 01:10:01,524
The big payback
That's where I learned

893
01:10:01,660 --> 01:10:05,114
He used to tap that ass
while you was over in Nam.

894
01:10:05,208 --> 01:10:07,119
- The big payback
- Motherfucker!

895
01:10:07,212 --> 01:10:11,544
- Goddam!
- You do some fuckin' talkin', don't you, goddam it!

896
01:10:11,678 --> 01:10:13,471
Try this on, motherfucker.

897
01:10:13,556 --> 01:10:16,179
- No, no, no. He needs his ass whipped.
- What you mean "no"?

898
01:10:17,939 --> 01:10:21,311
Get the fuck outta here!
Talk shit now, huh, motherfucker?

899
01:10:21,404 --> 01:10:24,525
- Shut the fuck up. Come on. Come on. Motherfucker. Now what?
- I'm ready to be respected

900
01:10:24,659 --> 01:10:27,117
You wanna fuck with me or what?
I'm gonna fuckin' kill your ass!

901
01:10:27,247 --> 01:10:29,871
- Say somethin' now, motherfucker.
- That's enough, youngblood.

902
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:34,257
- Pull out your goddam knife!
- No! That's enough. Come on!

903
01:10:34,385 --> 01:10:36,213
- I gonna kill this motherfucker!
- That's enough!

904
01:10:36,305 --> 01:10:38,180
That mother! I'm gonna kill
this motherfucker!

905
01:10:38,267 --> 01:10:40,842
- Let me go, Kirby! Let me go!
- No. He's already beat up. Come on now.

906
01:10:40,938 --> 01:10:45,734
- Oh, shit.
- Come on. Let's go get some air.

907
01:10:45,864 --> 01:10:48,238
Don't need no fuckin' air!
Let me go!

908
01:10:48,326 --> 01:10:50,617
- Let me hit him, hit him, hit him
- That's game.

909
01:11:13,205 --> 01:11:15,115
Shit.

910
01:11:15,208 --> 01:11:17,748
Gonna have the aeroplane corn bread.

911
01:11:17,838 --> 01:11:20,295
Here we go.
Ooh!

912
01:11:20,384 --> 01:11:22,959
- You gonna spoil that girl.
- Mm-hmm.

913
01:11:23,097 --> 01:11:25,851
Gonna spoil that one in your belly too.

914
01:11:25,977 --> 01:11:28,897
I don't need no spoiled kids.

915
01:11:28,982 --> 01:11:30,976
Hey, why not?

916
01:11:31,111 --> 01:11:32,904
Not enough black babies are spoiled.

917
01:11:32,989 --> 01:11:35,448
Ain't that right, Sarah, hmm?

918
01:11:35,578 --> 01:11:37,406
You got a point there.

919
01:11:38,499 --> 01:11:40,624
Come on. Sit on down.

920
01:11:42,799 --> 01:11:45,755
Big girl. Come here.

921
01:11:47,516 --> 01:11:49,391
Come here.

922
01:11:50,813 --> 01:11:53,485
Look at you.

923
01:11:53,569 --> 01:11:55,777
Fat girl.

924
01:11:55,864 --> 01:11:58,439
See what we got ourselves here.

925
01:11:58,535 --> 01:12:01,623
Oh, you know what? I think we're gonna
have ourselves a little boy.

926
01:12:03,712 --> 01:12:06,335
Yeah, come on, man.
You got to be a boy.

927
01:12:06,466 --> 01:12:09,339
Boy, boy, boy. Mm.

928
01:12:09,471 --> 01:12:14,102
Ant Junior.
See, it's the power of the mind.

929
01:12:14,230 --> 01:12:16,723
We will ourselves a little boy.

930
01:12:18,696 --> 01:12:21,023
Then can you will yourself
a better job?

931
01:12:24,665 --> 01:12:27,240
Can you will yourself to stop
drinkin' so much?

932
01:12:27,378 --> 01:12:30,252
Come on, honey.
Don't even start that shit, all right?

933
01:12:30,384 --> 01:12:33,589
I thought we supposed to be havin'
a nice time here.

934
01:12:39,901 --> 01:12:41,694
Look, Juanita.

935
01:12:42,823 --> 01:12:45,910
I- I'm gonna get myself
a... a good job.

936
01:12:45,996 --> 01:12:49,913
You know how long you been singin'
that same old song now, Anthony?

937
01:12:50,003 --> 01:12:52,756
I mean, in case you haven't noticed,
this here's the real world.

938
01:12:52,882 --> 01:12:55,256
Ain't no free meals here
like in the marines.

939
01:12:58,142 --> 01:13:01,762
Say, let me tell you somethin'.
Wasn't nothin' free in the marines.

940
01:13:01,857 --> 01:13:04,694
I earned every meal
and every fuckin' dollar, all right?

941
01:13:09,370 --> 01:13:11,281
Look, everything's gonna be cool.

942
01:13:14,797 --> 01:13:17,336
You know I'll be
five months next week.

943
01:13:17,468 --> 01:13:20,721
You're five months pregnant,
you can't be no nurse's aide.

944
01:13:20,849 --> 01:13:22,724
I said we'll be all right.

945
01:14:04,135 --> 01:14:08,302
Hey, um... Anybody want some speed?

946
01:14:08,435 --> 01:14:11,141
Get the fuck outta here
with that shit.

947
01:14:11,273 --> 01:14:13,646
Say, why don't you
cut the bullshit, Joe?

948
01:14:13,777 --> 01:14:16,697
Can't you clear your mind
for one sec, man?

949
01:14:16,783 --> 01:14:18,943
Now, you sure that they
pick up cash money?

950
01:14:19,078 --> 01:14:20,989
Hey, cash money, bro.

951
01:14:21,124 --> 01:14:23,533
Like clockwork, once a month.
Then they stop by the post office...

952
01:14:23,628 --> 01:14:26,916
before they make their final run
to Washington, man.

953
01:14:27,009 --> 01:14:29,965
All the way to Washington, D.C.,
where they burn the money.

954
01:14:30,098 --> 01:14:32,258
Can you believe that shit?

955
01:14:32,352 --> 01:14:34,928
Old bills, man.
Sometimes a couple million.

956
01:14:35,024 --> 01:14:38,110
- How many guards?
- Four.

957
01:14:38,195 --> 01:14:40,819
Two in the front
and one in the back carry revolvers.

958
01:14:40,951 --> 01:14:45,616
The other one, 12-gauge shotgun, man.

959
01:14:45,709 --> 01:14:47,502
You think we can take 'em?

960
01:14:50,385 --> 01:14:53,423
I can't say, man.
I mean...

961
01:14:53,515 --> 01:14:56,637
four guards, and all of 'em
packin'?

962
01:14:56,729 --> 01:15:00,600
I put up the guns. I get the money
together to get the plans goin'.

963
01:15:00,736 --> 01:15:02,695
But you got to be the master planner.

964
01:15:02,782 --> 01:15:05,357
You got medals for blowin'
motherfuckers up out there.

965
01:15:05,495 --> 01:15:09,745
- Man, I heard you were like John Wayne.
- Well, then that's the deal.

966
01:15:09,877 --> 01:15:12,037
Yeah, all that money.

967
01:15:12,173 --> 01:15:14,048
Ah, man.

968
01:15:16,263 --> 01:15:19,184
Anthony. You down?

969
01:15:22,399 --> 01:15:24,275
- Ahh.
- The look

970
01:15:25,656 --> 01:15:28,575
- Of love
- Let's drink on it anyway.

971
01:15:28,661 --> 01:15:33,161
- Is in your eyes
- Mmm.

972
01:15:34,797 --> 01:15:36,792
- Ahh.
- A look

973
01:15:36,926 --> 01:15:38,920
- Ooh, ooh, ooh.
- Your heart

974
01:15:39,055 --> 01:15:43,186
- Say, man. Shhh. -
Can't disguise - Hmm?

975
01:15:43,312 --> 01:15:47,016
Put the goddam thing away.
Get your little pyromaniac ass...

976
01:15:47,111 --> 01:15:49,900
- You gonna be walkin' in a minute.
- Aw, cool out, Kirby, man.

977
01:15:50,032 --> 01:15:52,740
I'm not gonna burn your car.
Not yet, at least.

978
01:16:00,927 --> 01:16:04,096
Don't go

979
01:16:04,224 --> 01:16:06,598
Forget it, Juanita.

980
01:16:06,687 --> 01:16:08,598
Come on. Watch out there.

981
01:16:12,406 --> 01:16:14,614
The look of love

982
01:16:17,665 --> 01:16:20,205
What's the problem, Anthony?

983
01:16:20,337 --> 01:16:24,040
What is it? I mean,
is it because I'm pregnant?

984
01:16:24,177 --> 01:16:25,922
Shh. Come on.
Now, don't be silly.

985
01:16:26,014 --> 01:16:27,924
So, then what's the problem?

986
01:16:32,149 --> 01:16:34,025
Come on. Talk to me.
What is it?

987
01:16:39,204 --> 01:16:41,958
I told you. You need to
leave that alcohol alone.

988
01:17:06,878 --> 01:17:09,668
- No! No!
- Anthony! Anthony, baby!

989
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:11,883
It's me.
It's me. It's all right.

990
01:17:11,971 --> 01:17:13,882
It's all right.
Come here.

991
01:17:13,974 --> 01:17:18,640
Shh. Shh. Shh.
It's just another dream.

992
01:17:18,774 --> 01:17:20,650
It's just another dream.

993
01:17:28,417 --> 01:17:30,660
This is my best cut,
Mrs Stein. Enjoy.

994
01:17:30,796 --> 01:17:33,336
Thank you very much, Saul.

995
01:17:33,468 --> 01:17:37,171
- He's such a nice man.
- What did he give you?

996
01:17:37,308 --> 01:17:39,349
- We need to talk.
- Oh.

997
01:17:43,318 --> 01:17:46,405
- So what's happenin'?
- You're a good man.

998
01:17:46,491 --> 01:17:50,361
Aw, come on, Saul. I ain't got time to kibitz
with ya. I got a whole lot of meat to cut.

999
01:17:52,585 --> 01:17:54,496
I'm closing down the shop.

1000
01:17:56,634 --> 01:17:59,305
Should've told you sooner,
but I thought maybe...

1001
01:17:59,388 --> 01:18:01,965
business, you know,
pick up a little.

1002
01:18:03,689 --> 01:18:05,349
Sorry.

1003
01:18:07,111 --> 01:18:10,530
- Here.
- Oh, no, look, Saul... No. I can't.

1004
01:18:10,659 --> 01:18:13,616
What am I gonna do with it?
I have to get rid of it.

1005
01:18:13,707 --> 01:18:15,415
Come on.

1006
01:18:23,223 --> 01:18:25,134
Now I know

1007
01:18:25,226 --> 01:18:29,013
We have great respect

1008
01:18:29,150 --> 01:18:32,024
For the sister and mother

1009
01:18:32,156 --> 01:18:34,031
It's even better yet

1010
01:18:36,497 --> 01:18:39,072
But there's the joker in the street

1011
01:18:39,210 --> 01:18:43,211
Here you go, brother.
Don't let the bullshit get to you.

1012
01:18:43,300 --> 01:18:45,211
I'm tryin', man. I'm tryin'.

1013
01:18:45,304 --> 01:18:47,512
You wanna get the man's foot
off your neck?

1014
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:50,473
Come check us out.

1015
01:18:50,605 --> 01:18:53,442
Take care of yourself, brother.
Live righteous.

1016
01:18:53,569 --> 01:18:55,943
Here you go, brother.
Here you go.

1017
01:18:56,074 --> 01:18:59,112
Take care of yourself, brother.
Come see us now.

1018
01:18:59,246 --> 01:19:01,406
Don't let us hang around this town

1019
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:05,798
- Here you go, sister.
- And let what others say come true

1020
01:19:05,925 --> 01:19:07,503
Brothers and sisters, here you go.

1021
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:25,607
Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh.
Hey, youngblood.

1022
01:19:29,079 --> 01:19:30,872
Bringin' in the groceries, huh?

1023
01:19:32,418 --> 01:19:34,911
Lord, have mercy.

1024
01:19:35,048 --> 01:19:37,720
Man, I remember
when I was married.

1025
01:19:37,845 --> 01:19:41,014
I used to love
to bring home the groceries.

1026
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:43,594
Made me feel real good.

1027
01:19:43,731 --> 01:19:47,779
Like a man. Know what I mean?

1028
01:19:49,115 --> 01:19:50,908
Hey, listen, youngblood. Uh...

1029
01:19:51,035 --> 01:19:52,994
I just dropped by
to see Juanita and Sarah.

1030
01:19:53,122 --> 01:19:56,126
- You know, lay a little somethin' on 'em.
- Stopped by to see my baby?

1031
01:19:56,253 --> 01:19:57,914
Is that right?

1032
01:19:58,048 --> 01:19:59,923
You know, youngblood...

1033
01:20:00,051 --> 01:20:03,054
I took care of your woman and your baby
when you were in the war.

1034
01:20:03,140 --> 01:20:06,594
Now, a man oughta get a little respect
for somethin' like that.

1035
01:20:06,688 --> 01:20:08,433
Now, I ain't gonna lie to you.

1036
01:20:08,525 --> 01:20:11,944
I care about Juanita.
I care about her a whole lot.

1037
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:16,079
But you back now, and I'm gone.

1038
01:20:16,164 --> 01:20:19,832
So from this point on, you should
consider me like a friend of the family.

1039
01:20:19,962 --> 01:20:22,122
Find yourself in a jam and shit,
need a little cash...

1040
01:20:22,258 --> 01:20:25,095
you come see me,
I'll front you.

1041
01:20:25,179 --> 01:20:27,637
- Keep your shit.
- Listen, brother.

1042
01:20:27,726 --> 01:20:29,970
I know about pride.

1043
01:20:30,105 --> 01:20:32,146
But you got mouths to feed.

1044
01:20:32,276 --> 01:20:34,186
Now, I laid a little cash
on Juanita.

1045
01:20:34,321 --> 01:20:37,158
Say, man, stay the fuck
away from my family.

1046
01:20:37,242 --> 01:20:38,868
What did you say?

1047
01:20:38,996 --> 01:20:41,453
You heard me, goddam it.

1048
01:20:41,542 --> 01:20:43,584
I said, "Stay the fuck away
from my family. "

1049
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:47,544
See, I ain't the enemy, youngblood.

1050
01:20:50,391 --> 01:20:52,516
I don't want no trouble.

1051
01:20:59,700 --> 01:21:01,694
Shit.

1052
01:21:07,254 --> 01:21:10,757
See, I tried to be a friend,
motherfucker.

1053
01:21:18,442 --> 01:21:20,352
Surprise, nigger.

1054
01:21:22,824 --> 01:21:25,744
Big bad marines.

1055
01:21:25,830 --> 01:21:27,740
Look at you now.

1056
01:21:28,918 --> 01:21:31,458
Does she suck you?

1057
01:21:31,590 --> 01:21:33,133
Fuck you?

1058
01:21:34,262 --> 01:21:36,933
Make you feel like a man?

1059
01:21:37,016 --> 01:21:38,927
Make you feel real good?

1060
01:21:40,940 --> 01:21:43,777
Huh, boy?

1061
01:21:43,904 --> 01:21:46,777
Now, she wasn't doin' it like that
before you went to the war, now was she?

1062
01:21:51,500 --> 01:21:53,708
Now you gettin'
all that good lovin'...

1063
01:21:55,174 --> 01:21:57,845
and you can't even put food
on your fuckin' table.

1064
01:21:59,640 --> 01:22:03,261
Come on, Santa Claus.
Open your mouth and suck this.

1065
01:22:03,355 --> 01:22:05,978
Come on. I got a present for you.
Suck it!

1066
01:22:06,110 --> 01:22:09,647
- Suck it, nigger!
- Kill me, motherfucker.

1067
01:22:09,741 --> 01:22:11,700
Shoot me right now.

1068
01:22:11,828 --> 01:22:13,657
What you gonna do, shoot me?

1069
01:22:20,302 --> 01:22:23,222
You lucky this is personal, nigger.

1070
01:22:23,349 --> 01:22:25,509
I ain't gonna kill you
over no woman.

1071
01:22:26,730 --> 01:22:28,725
Don't you ever...

1072
01:22:28,859 --> 01:22:30,853
in your fuckin' life...

1073
01:22:32,031 --> 01:22:34,607
bite the hand
that feeds you, nigger.

1074
01:22:41,715 --> 01:22:44,005
See ya, Santa Claus.

1075
01:22:50,440 --> 01:22:52,814
- Hold still now.
- I'm all right.

1076
01:22:52,944 --> 01:22:55,318
- Hold still.
- No, I'm all right. Damn!

1077
01:23:12,144 --> 01:23:15,101
You givin' him that money back.

1078
01:23:15,192 --> 01:23:17,649
He won't take it back.

1079
01:23:17,780 --> 01:23:21,946
What the fuck you talkin'...
You better get his shit back to him!

1080
01:23:22,079 --> 01:23:26,080
Even if I wanted to give it back to him,
Anthony, he wouldn't take it back.

1081
01:23:26,169 --> 01:23:30,170
W- W-W-Wait. What the fuck you talkin'
about, "if you wanted to give it back"?

1082
01:23:31,429 --> 01:23:33,091
No, no, no, no.
Fuck that shit.

1083
01:23:33,183 --> 01:23:36,768
Have you forgotten you just lost your
damn job? We need that fuckin' money.

1084
01:23:36,856 --> 01:23:39,609
- We don't need his money.
- Yeah, well, Anthony, I'll tell you what.

1085
01:23:39,694 --> 01:23:44,110
You start bringin' some real money in here, like a real
man, and then I'll think about givin' it back to him.

1086
01:23:44,202 --> 01:23:47,740
Until then, I don't wanna hear shit.

1087
01:23:47,875 --> 01:23:52,672
You need to get your tight ass together, that's what you
need to do, and stop feelin' sorry for your damn self.

1088
01:23:52,801 --> 01:23:56,672
Sometimes it's like you ain't even
the same man I knew before the war.

1089
01:23:56,808 --> 01:23:59,847
That's who I was in love with. That's who
I thought showed the fuck back up here.

1090
01:23:59,980 --> 01:24:02,854
I don't know who the fuck you are.

1091
01:24:02,944 --> 01:24:05,781
So, what? You just, uh,
suck his dick so good...

1092
01:24:05,907 --> 01:24:08,995
he just start
throwin' money at you, right?

1093
01:24:09,080 --> 01:24:10,742
What is with you?

1094
01:24:10,875 --> 01:24:13,913
Why you so damn paranoid?
I ain't fuckin' him.

1095
01:24:14,047 --> 01:24:16,088
Not at this moment, you ain't. No.

1096
01:24:16,217 --> 01:24:17,927
But the motherfucker
ain't sniffin' around here...

1097
01:24:18,054 --> 01:24:20,844
tossin' money in your
motherfuckin' face for nothin'!

1098
01:24:20,935 --> 01:24:24,057
Yeah, well, I sleep with you
every night, don't I?

1099
01:24:24,190 --> 01:24:27,527
You know, Juanita,
that's a damn good question.

1100
01:24:29,241 --> 01:24:32,161
Come on. Go ahead.

1101
01:24:32,288 --> 01:24:34,995
Admit this shit, man. Be honest.
You fuckin' him, right?

1102
01:24:35,127 --> 01:24:37,620
- Is that what you wanna hear, Anthony? That's
what you wanna hear? - Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah.

1103
01:24:37,756 --> 01:24:40,463
Fine. I'm fuckin' him.

1104
01:24:44,017 --> 01:24:46,890
So, uh, whose baby is that?

1105
01:24:49,986 --> 01:24:52,396
D- Don't even answer that shit.

1106
01:24:52,491 --> 01:24:54,615
No, you right. I ain't gonna answer it.
I mean, shit. You Anthony.

1107
01:24:54,703 --> 01:24:58,157
You the big marine man with no damn job.
You know every fuckin' thing.

1108
01:24:58,293 --> 01:25:04,300
Answer this for me: If you think I'm jivin' you
so much, Anthony, why the hell you with me? Huh?

1109
01:25:04,387 --> 01:25:08,340
Why the fuck you with me? What, you think
I need you? Do you think I need this shit?

1110
01:25:08,478 --> 01:25:10,851
Fuck. You can't get a decent job,
you won't fuck me.

1111
01:25:10,982 --> 01:25:13,772
The only time I get to hold you is when you're
havin' one of them silly-ass nightmares...

1112
01:25:13,862 --> 01:25:15,821
Shut the fuck up!
Shut the fuck up!

1113
01:25:15,908 --> 01:25:18,447
You don't know, girl.
You really don't know.

1114
01:25:21,543 --> 01:25:24,250
- Don't you fuckin' walk away from...
- You better get the fuck off of me!

1115
01:25:24,381 --> 01:25:27,301
- Don't walk away from me, Anthony.
- Let me go.

1116
01:25:27,387 --> 01:25:29,714
- Don't you... What about Sarah?
- I'll fuckin' kill you, girl!

1117
01:25:29,849 --> 01:25:33,352
Don't you ever run up on me! Ever!
Ever run up on me again!

1118
01:25:33,481 --> 01:25:37,185
I'll fuckin' kill you, Juanita!
Get the fuck off me!

1119
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:39,189
Bunch of shit!

1120
01:25:57,941 --> 01:26:00,434
- Yeah!
- That's right. You can't trust them!

1121
01:26:04,119 --> 01:26:07,990
- Now, they send our men off to Vietnam...
- That's what they do.

1122
01:26:08,126 --> 01:26:11,545
to fight for this
so-called democracy.

1123
01:26:11,633 --> 01:26:14,090
- That's right. Preach, sister.
- Yeah! Yeah!

1124
01:26:14,220 --> 01:26:16,215
But when they get back down
to the South Bronx...

1125
01:26:16,307 --> 01:26:19,477
and to Bed-Stuy and Harlem
and Watts, etc., etc...

1126
01:26:19,605 --> 01:26:22,312
shit is worse than ever.

1127
01:26:25,992 --> 01:26:29,695
- There is something very sick about that.
- He's a devil.

1128
01:26:29,832 --> 01:26:31,660
That's right,
he's the devil.

1129
01:26:33,839 --> 01:26:35,999
That's right!

1130
01:26:38,597 --> 01:26:42,052
Go, sister! Go on!

1131
01:26:42,187 --> 01:26:44,810
- Power to the people!
- Power to the people!

1132
01:26:46,862 --> 01:26:50,068
- In 'n' out.
- Never, never gonna give you up

1133
01:26:50,201 --> 01:26:52,825
I'm never, ever gonna stop

1134
01:26:52,914 --> 01:26:55,324
Not the way
I feel about you

1135
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:58,583
- Girl, I just can't live without you
- There you go.

1136
01:26:58,716 --> 01:27:01,043
- I'm never, ever gonna quit
- What can I get you, baby?

1137
01:27:01,179 --> 01:27:03,553
Anyway, so like I was sayin',
I ran into this brother...

1138
01:27:03,684 --> 01:27:05,642
and he, uh, gave me
this flyer.

1139
01:27:05,730 --> 01:27:07,973
So I figured I'd go over
and check it out.

1140
01:27:08,067 --> 01:27:13,278
And there you were, up there
talkin' that ol' righteous shit.

1141
01:27:13,409 --> 01:27:17,576
I'm just a college student tryin' to do
her part to rally the people together.

1142
01:27:17,708 --> 01:27:22,042
But, dig, we need more
than talk. It's... It's time to do.

1143
01:27:22,134 --> 01:27:24,709
- Do what?
- Revolution.

1144
01:27:24,805 --> 01:27:27,892
Oh, wait a minute. See.
Y'all a little outta my league now.

1145
01:27:27,978 --> 01:27:30,138
Is that what you're gonna say
when the revolution comes?

1146
01:27:30,273 --> 01:27:33,229
W- When it's time
to pick up a gun?

1147
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:35,231
What you know
about weapons?

1148
01:27:37,202 --> 01:27:39,279
I'm qualified
to handle a. 45...

1149
01:27:39,414 --> 01:27:42,584
an M-16 rifle,
a. 38-calibre pistol...

1150
01:27:42,712 --> 01:27:44,753
and a Russian AK-47.

1151
01:27:44,841 --> 01:27:48,094
An AK-47?

1152
01:27:52,187 --> 01:27:54,182
Why don't you join us?

1153
01:27:54,316 --> 01:27:57,105
A lot of brothers
from the war have.

1154
01:27:57,238 --> 01:28:00,325
Baby, I got enough
heavy shit to deal with.

1155
01:28:08,007 --> 01:28:10,085
- I got you, brother.
- Relax.

1156
01:28:12,974 --> 01:28:15,301
You're so uptight.

1157
01:28:15,437 --> 01:28:18,560
Damn, I got to make
some fuckin' bread.

1158
01:28:18,693 --> 01:28:21,612
I'm through
with your sister, but...

1159
01:28:21,698 --> 01:28:25,319
I still got to take care
of my baby girl, Sarah.

1160
01:28:25,455 --> 01:28:28,412
Shit, and the one
that's on the way.

1161
01:28:28,544 --> 01:28:31,037
Damn!

1162
01:28:31,173 --> 01:28:35,506
Look, anyway, uh, I got
this plan to make some money.

1163
01:28:35,640 --> 01:28:38,179
I want you to keep
this shit to yourself.

1164
01:28:40,482 --> 01:28:43,604
At 6:15 a. m., the truck
pulls outta the post office...

1165
01:28:43,737 --> 01:28:46,990
at 149th and Grand Concourse.

1166
01:28:47,077 --> 01:28:50,330
Now, it makes one stop
before it goes to D. C...

1167
01:28:50,417 --> 01:28:54,583
which is a mail drop-off
at First Federal Loan and Savings...

1168
01:28:54,716 --> 01:28:57,672
which is on Noble Street
and West.

1169
01:28:57,762 --> 01:28:59,673
Now, Kirby...

1170
01:28:59,766 --> 01:29:01,760
you're gonna position yourself
in a getaway car...

1171
01:29:01,895 --> 01:29:05,231
at the end of the corner,
where you can see everything.

1172
01:29:05,318 --> 01:29:09,568
Jose. Me and you gonna
position ourselves behind the bank...

1173
01:29:09,659 --> 01:29:14,324
underneath the left
and the right side of the loadin' dock.

1174
01:29:14,460 --> 01:29:18,626
Delilah, you're gonna position
yourself inside the Dumpster...

1175
01:29:18,759 --> 01:29:21,845
which is located directly across
from the loadin' dock.

1176
01:29:24,853 --> 01:29:27,476
Now, Skippy, I want you
to position yourself...

1177
01:29:27,608 --> 01:29:30,814
approximately ten feet
from the alleyway.

1178
01:29:30,947 --> 01:29:34,401
There, you post
a lookout.

1179
01:29:34,496 --> 01:29:36,405
We all know what to do
at the point of attack...

1180
01:29:36,498 --> 01:29:39,372
because we've gone
over that shit enough.

1181
01:29:39,504 --> 01:29:44,169
If anybody gets caught, you shut
the fuck up, and we'll keep your money.

1182
01:29:44,304 --> 01:29:46,845
Shh! Fuck that shit, man.

1183
01:29:46,976 --> 01:29:49,433
I'm telling you right now,
if I get caught...

1184
01:29:51,609 --> 01:29:54,232
- I'm shooting my fuckin' way out.
- Nigger, put that shit down.

1185
01:29:54,363 --> 01:29:57,201
I think we need another man
on the street with Skip.

1186
01:29:57,328 --> 01:29:59,156
Someone to cover
the other side.

1187
01:29:59,248 --> 01:30:02,204
- I agree.
- Oh, man! Hell, no!

1188
01:30:02,336 --> 01:30:04,330
We don't need no 'nother man.
Shit, I can see.

1189
01:30:04,423 --> 01:30:07,842
- Besides, we got too many motherfuckers anyway.
- Fuck that shit, Kirby, man.

1190
01:30:07,930 --> 01:30:11,017
Everybody trusts
everybody here, right?

1191
01:30:14,441 --> 01:30:16,566
I can get somebody
from our organization.

1192
01:30:16,695 --> 01:30:20,827
Oh, no, no, no, no. I don't want none
of them revolutionary niggers involved.

1193
01:30:20,912 --> 01:30:23,369
You can cut your eye at me
all you want to.

1194
01:30:23,499 --> 01:30:25,707
I ain't too keen on havin'
that broad up in here neither.

1195
01:30:25,837 --> 01:30:29,291
Well, you the one talkin' about we need
another man. Make up your goddam mind.

1196
01:30:29,427 --> 01:30:32,264
You have somebody in mind,
Anthony?

1197
01:30:32,390 --> 01:30:36,058
We might as well put a motherfuckin' ad
in the paper. Then we gonna get everybody.

1198
01:30:36,188 --> 01:30:38,978
Shit, ain't gonna be
no money left for a nigger.

1199
01:30:42,867 --> 01:30:46,820
Oh, yes! Y'all didn't know
your reverend was a gamblin' man?

1200
01:30:46,958 --> 01:30:51,090
A sinnin' man?

1201
01:30:51,174 --> 01:30:54,011
I was a man who maimed!

1202
01:30:56,141 --> 01:30:58,016
I was a man who killed!

1203
01:31:00,232 --> 01:31:04,731
We all know it was done
in the name of the wicked one.

1204
01:31:04,823 --> 01:31:08,776
The one that was
cast down from heaven.

1205
01:31:08,913 --> 01:31:12,368
- Hallelujah!
- Amen!

1206
01:31:12,503 --> 01:31:16,967
I said y'all know
who I'm talkin' about!

1207
01:31:17,096 --> 01:31:19,767
Can I get a "hallelujah"
in this house of God?

1208
01:31:19,850 --> 01:31:22,010
Hallelujah!

1209
01:31:22,146 --> 01:31:23,725
Hallelujah!

1210
01:31:23,857 --> 01:31:27,312
Well, look here, man.
Skip is in. Period. All right?

1211
01:31:27,406 --> 01:31:31,157
I stand a lot to lose
if this thing blows up in my face.

1212
01:31:31,288 --> 01:31:34,326
The last time I saw him, he was
shooting poison in his veins.

1213
01:31:34,418 --> 01:31:37,457
Yeah, I know. Well, you know,
he's tryin' to shake that shit, man.

1214
01:31:37,549 --> 01:31:41,466
- He's still on drugs.
- And I still trust him with my life, Cleon.

1215
01:31:43,226 --> 01:31:46,727
Remember that last battle?

1216
01:31:46,856 --> 01:31:48,767
He froze up.

1217
01:31:48,902 --> 01:31:52,487
For a minute.
Then h-he broke out of it.

1218
01:31:52,575 --> 01:31:57,205
And when he "broke out of it,"
Dugan was dead.

1219
01:31:57,292 --> 01:31:59,536
Come on, Cleon. You know that
could've happened to any of us.

1220
01:31:59,630 --> 01:32:03,381
Now either you in
or you out. Which one?

1221
01:32:03,512 --> 01:32:06,052
How much money did you say
was in that truck?

1222
01:34:29,022 --> 01:34:30,980
We still got
about 15 minutes.

1223
01:34:31,067 --> 01:34:33,476
I tell ya, I could've
used another cup of coffee.

1224
01:34:33,613 --> 01:34:35,488
Let's make this quick.

1225
01:34:42,713 --> 01:34:44,588
Bank security.

1226
01:34:50,602 --> 01:34:52,513
- How ya doin'?
- Good.

1227
01:34:52,606 --> 01:34:54,517
- Mornin'.
- Good mornin'.

1228
01:35:30,674 --> 01:35:32,882
Oh, f...

1229
01:35:47,162 --> 01:35:49,950
You waitin' on
the number 11 bus?

1230
01:35:50,083 --> 01:35:51,994
Yes.

1231
01:35:52,128 --> 01:35:55,132
I don't think
she runs this early.

1232
01:35:55,259 --> 01:35:59,806
I caught it the other morning,
uh, at this same time.

1233
01:35:59,934 --> 01:36:01,311
You sure about that?

1234
01:36:02,690 --> 01:36:04,599
Uh-huh.

1235
01:36:04,693 --> 01:36:07,981
- Let me check for you.
- No need to go to any trouble, Officer.

1236
01:36:08,115 --> 01:36:09,991
No, no, no.
No trouble at all, brother.

1237
01:36:13,041 --> 01:36:15,615
I see by that patch
on your jacket you were in recon.

1238
01:36:15,650 --> 01:36:19,865
I was a 5th marine. Always willin'
to help out a fellow leatherneck.

1239
01:36:25,251 --> 01:36:27,162
Brown on patrol.
Brown on patrol.

1240
01:36:27,255 --> 01:36:30,709
Requesting off-hour route check
on number 11.

1241
01:36:30,803 --> 01:36:33,378
Dispatch to Brown.
Hold for schedule.

1242
01:36:33,474 --> 01:36:35,385
That's a copy.

1243
01:36:35,478 --> 01:36:37,686
Do somethin', Cleon.

1244
01:37:13,462 --> 01:37:16,466
- Ambush! Ambush!
- Drop it, motherfucker!

1245
01:37:51,989 --> 01:37:54,565
What the hell?

1246
01:37:56,915 --> 01:37:58,708
Shit!

1247
01:38:31,519 --> 01:38:34,605
Joe! Come on. Let's move.

1248
01:38:44,834 --> 01:38:47,541
Oh, goddam it!

1249
01:39:28,328 --> 01:39:31,166
Fuck! Shit!

1250
01:39:37,637 --> 01:39:40,260
Oh, shit!

1251
01:39:41,769 --> 01:39:43,894
Anthony!

1252
01:40:17,542 --> 01:40:20,830
- Did you see that shit, man?
- Hey, what the fuck wrong with you?

1253
01:40:20,964 --> 01:40:23,338
- See the way the fuckin' doors blew off, man?
- No, motherfucker!

1254
01:40:23,427 --> 01:40:25,801
Motherfuckin' Joe, you blew the whole
motherfuckin' truck up, motherfucker!

1255
01:40:25,890 --> 01:40:28,430
- It blew up like that, man!
- That's how you fucked your hand up last time!

1256
01:40:28,561 --> 01:40:31,054
You... And the money... You fucked up.
I'm gonna kick your motherfuckin' ass!

1257
01:40:31,191 --> 01:40:33,684
Grab what you can, motherfucker,
before the whole thing burns!

1258
01:40:33,779 --> 01:40:35,857
Hey, Anthony and Delilah
gotta see this shit, man.

1259
01:40:35,991 --> 01:40:38,199
I'm gonna go get 'em!
Hey, Anthony!

1260
01:40:40,082 --> 01:40:43,786
You gotta see the shit I did, man.
I blew that shit up, man!

1261
01:40:43,922 --> 01:40:47,376
You gotta see it, man!
You gotta see the shit I did!

1262
01:40:49,641 --> 01:40:52,216
Let's get outta here.
Put the gun down. Put the gun down.

1263
01:40:52,354 --> 01:40:54,265
Come on, Delilah.
Let's get up. Up. Let's go.

1264
01:40:56,445 --> 01:40:59,281
Come on, bro.

1265
01:40:59,408 --> 01:41:02,328
We gotta go, man.

1266
01:41:02,455 --> 01:41:05,577
I can't...
I can't leave her.

1267
01:41:05,670 --> 01:41:08,589
You ain't gotta
leave her, bro...

1268
01:41:08,675 --> 01:41:11,167
'cause she's already gone.

1269
01:41:15,395 --> 01:41:16,938
Get up here!
Go on!

1270
01:42:16,421 --> 01:42:19,340
Unit 1004, do you copy?

1271
01:42:19,426 --> 01:42:21,634
Please respond.

1272
01:42:21,763 --> 01:42:25,716
Do you require assistance?
Do you copy?

1273
01:42:25,812 --> 01:42:28,140
Any available units
in the vicinity of Noble Street.

1274
01:42:28,276 --> 01:42:30,603
Two-eleven in progress.
Code three. Repeat.

1275
01:42:30,738 --> 01:42:32,779
Two-eleven in progress.
Code three.

1276
01:43:02,085 --> 01:43:04,959
God's not gonna
forgive me for this one.

1277
01:43:05,091 --> 01:43:09,258
I'll tell you what, Reverend. With this kind
of money, you can buy your way into heaven.

1278
01:43:11,019 --> 01:43:13,772
That's where you're wrong, brother.

1279
01:43:13,857 --> 01:43:18,487
We done bought our way into hell.

1280
01:43:18,574 --> 01:43:22,657
The plain fact is that I promised
the Lord I would never sin like this.

1281
01:43:25,336 --> 01:43:28,708
To tell you the truth, I'm not sure
I even want any of this dirty money.

1282
01:43:30,219 --> 01:43:32,795
Well, I'll tell you what,
Reverend.

1283
01:43:32,891 --> 01:43:34,802
We'll find somethin'
to do with your share.

1284
01:43:34,895 --> 01:43:38,765
- Amen to that shit.
- No. No, no, no, no.

1285
01:43:38,902 --> 01:43:41,573
- I'll take the money.
- You lyin' sack o' shit.

1286
01:43:43,743 --> 01:43:46,913
I'm sure the Lord will find
another way for me to do my penance.

1287
01:43:48,753 --> 01:43:51,080
Just tell me
one thing, Cleon.

1288
01:43:51,215 --> 01:43:53,542
Why the fuck
you didn't grab the cop?

1289
01:43:53,636 --> 01:43:56,925
You killed him.
A young brother.

1290
01:43:57,059 --> 01:44:00,395
If you wouldn't have froze up like a bitch, maybe
I wouldn't have had to do that shit, now wouldn't I?

1291
01:44:00,481 --> 01:44:02,641
Would y'all
shut the fuck up?

1292
01:44:04,155 --> 01:44:07,443
Man, Delilah. Shit.

1293
01:44:07,578 --> 01:44:10,748
Man, radio said they got
Joe's stupid ass.

1294
01:44:10,876 --> 01:44:14,578
Fucked it up.
The whole plan was fucked up.

1295
01:44:17,387 --> 01:44:20,425
We ain't do shit right
out there, man. Shit.

1296
01:44:23,315 --> 01:44:27,398
Y'all make sure that Jose's share
goes to Marisol and his kids.

1297
01:44:27,489 --> 01:44:29,530
- Walk on by
- Done.

1298
01:44:35,878 --> 01:44:39,001
Your junkie ass really
messed up out there.

1299
01:44:39,135 --> 01:44:40,795
Don't blame me
for your fuck-ups.

1300
01:44:40,888 --> 01:44:46,348
I told Anthony I didn't want nothin' to
do with a crazy, devil-filled junkie!

1301
01:44:46,480 --> 01:44:49,235
- What?
- You listenin' to me? Look at him.

1302
01:44:50,613 --> 01:44:53,617
- Oh, shit!
- Now say some more shit!

1303
01:44:53,702 --> 01:44:55,613
I'll knock your ass
right back down.

1304
01:44:55,706 --> 01:44:58,459
Fake-ass wanna-be preacher,
no-members-havin' motherfucker!

1305
01:44:58,544 --> 01:45:02,545
Why don't y'all stop actin'
like some fuckin' clowns?

1306
01:45:02,676 --> 01:45:05,633
You know, you niggers
sure is silly.

1307
01:45:05,724 --> 01:45:09,392
Now, you're standin' here fightin',
and we got over $300,000...

1308
01:45:09,522 --> 01:45:12,810
of cold, hard, unmarked U.S. cash
to split up five ways.

1309
01:45:12,903 --> 01:45:16,357
Let me tell ya somethin'. You make me lose
count again, I'm gonna shoot me a motherfucker...

1310
01:45:16,493 --> 01:45:18,534
and then we gonna be splittin'
this thing up four ways, hear?

1311
01:45:21,836 --> 01:45:25,967
Man, I can't believe this.
They was gonna burn all this shit.

1312
01:45:26,093 --> 01:45:29,049
All this shit, and a nigger
can't even find a job.

1313
01:45:30,643 --> 01:45:34,596
Well, that's Uncle Sam
for you, baby.

1314
01:45:34,733 --> 01:45:36,609
Money to burn.

1315
01:45:39,242 --> 01:45:42,245
Police have issued an all-points
bulletin for the remaining...

1316
01:45:42,331 --> 01:45:44,241
...Reserve Bank
on Noble Street.

1317
01:45:44,334 --> 01:45:45,830
Faces painted skeleton white.

1318
01:45:45,962 --> 01:45:48,716
Cobra, request your status.
Over.

1319
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:50,676
- Five federal security guards...
- Anthony!

1320
01:45:50,804 --> 01:45:53,558
- She's already gone.
- Do it. Kill me.

1321
01:45:53,643 --> 01:45:55,304
The bloody shootout erupted...
an armoured truck... explosives...

1322
01:45:55,438 --> 01:45:59,140
No, motherfuckin' Joe. You blew the whole
motherfuckin' truck up, motherfucker!

1323
01:45:59,277 --> 01:46:00,607
...the deaths of nine people.

1324
01:46:00,697 --> 01:46:04,282
The heroin ain't never
did nothin' to me.

1325
01:46:04,370 --> 01:46:06,744
...just moments away from the scene
of the crime... Robbery turned bloody...

1326
01:46:06,832 --> 01:46:10,335
- Had some shit got into me over there, man.
- Crushed to death by...

1327
01:46:10,464 --> 01:46:13,551
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer

1328
01:46:13,679 --> 01:46:16,800
Had a very shiny nose

1329
01:46:16,934 --> 01:46:18,893
- And if you ever saw it
- What you slowin' down for?

1330
01:46:19,021 --> 01:46:20,220
- Be cool. Be cool.
- What you doin'?

1331
01:46:20,357 --> 01:46:23,895
- Come on. Come on.
- What the fuck, man? Aw, shit!

1332
01:46:24,030 --> 01:46:27,734
- All of the other reindeer
- What the fuck we doin' over here?

1333
01:46:27,871 --> 01:46:30,446
- Say, man, check out all these kids.
- Man!

1334
01:46:30,542 --> 01:46:32,417
Hey, let's go to the liquor store
and go to the club.

1335
01:46:32,545 --> 01:46:35,299
Look, man, I'm gonna take care of you.
We're gonna go down to the club.

1336
01:46:35,383 --> 01:46:37,461
- We don't know them motherfuckers!
- That's the whole point, baby.

1337
01:46:37,555 --> 01:46:39,929
Come on. Get in the spirit.
Hey, y'all come on over here!

1338
01:46:40,059 --> 01:46:43,181
- Nigger, we gonna get robbed.
- Hey, be cool, nigger. Y'all come on over here.

1339
01:46:43,273 --> 01:46:48,153
- Be cool, man. Damn.
- Rudolph, with your nose so bright

1340
01:46:48,240 --> 01:46:50,365
All of y'all gonna get some.
All right. All right.

1341
01:46:50,452 --> 01:46:52,363
- Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
- What, motherfu...

1342
01:46:52,456 --> 01:46:54,616
Yeah, man. Merry Christmas,
motherfucker. Go on. Leave me alone.

1343
01:46:54,752 --> 01:46:58,539
Say, say, Skippy. Hey, man, why don't you
bring your ass over here and quit that jivin'.

1344
01:46:58,675 --> 01:47:01,631
Come on. Yeah, yeah. Y'all take
all the toys. All right. Get one.

1345
01:47:01,765 --> 01:47:04,340
- See what I'm sayin'? I ain't kiddin'. We givin' it away.
- All right. All right. Yeah.

1346
01:47:04,436 --> 01:47:07,392
That's why Santa Claus don't wanna come 'round here
'cause he's scared he's gonna get shot or robbed.

1347
01:47:07,524 --> 01:47:12,487
All right. Just one. Hey, hey, hey. Give
me this, man. Get a... Get a... Get a toy.

1348
01:47:12,617 --> 01:47:14,658
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Why you stealin'? You ain't gotta steal.

1349
01:47:14,788 --> 01:47:17,078
- All right, all right, all right.
- Funky little brothers. I talked to him.

1350
01:47:17,167 --> 01:47:19,921
He says he ain't never gonna come down
here unless he's got police protection.

1351
01:47:20,006 --> 01:47:22,795
Last year, one of y'all niggers
stole one of his reindeer.

1352
01:47:30,316 --> 01:47:34,447
No, no. I say let's just go up there
and kill that motherfucker.

1353
01:47:36,201 --> 01:47:39,703
Man, me and Anthony gave out
a couple of things, but that was it.

1354
01:47:39,832 --> 01:47:43,785
You gave toys and turkeys to people.
Then you got the hell outta Dodge.

1355
01:47:43,923 --> 01:47:48,304
Man. Y'all sayin' my man is
goin' around handin' out $100 bills...

1356
01:47:48,390 --> 01:47:50,799
and sayin' that
God Almighty gave it to him?

1357
01:47:50,894 --> 01:47:54,645
My cousin lives up there in Mount Vernon. He
says that Cleon's up there actin' a goddam fool.

1358
01:47:54,734 --> 01:47:56,894
That ol' high-profile ass
nigger.

1359
01:47:57,030 --> 01:47:58,905
Bought a brand-new Caddy.

1360
01:47:59,033 --> 01:48:00,743
Folk know he can't afford it.

1361
01:48:00,870 --> 01:48:04,491
- Look, man, I'm gonna go over there and talk to him.
- No, no, no. Fuck the talk!

1362
01:48:04,585 --> 01:48:07,504
I'm drivin' up there, and I'm gonna
take him out before he rats us out.

1363
01:48:07,590 --> 01:48:10,510
Look, Kirby.
I'm gonna handle everything, all right?

1364
01:48:10,638 --> 01:48:14,341
- I'm gonna straighten this shit out.
- All right.

1365
01:48:14,478 --> 01:48:18,015
But if you don't take care of this,
Anthony, I promise you, I will.

1366
01:48:18,110 --> 01:48:20,318
I told you we didn't
need another man.

1367
01:48:20,405 --> 01:48:23,325
That's y'all's motherfuckin'
punk-ass friend!

1368
01:48:23,410 --> 01:48:26,864
People runnin' from their worries

1369
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,290
While the judge and his juries

1370
01:48:30,757 --> 01:48:34,259
They take the law
that's part of the flaw

1371
01:48:34,389 --> 01:48:38,390
No. Oh, shit, Cleon!

1372
01:48:38,479 --> 01:48:40,557
Love, fallin', fussin' and a-cussin'

1373
01:48:40,650 --> 01:48:42,229
Damn!

1374
01:48:43,404 --> 01:48:45,695
The feelin' now is killin'

1375
01:48:47,245 --> 01:48:49,571
For peace no one is willin'

1376
01:48:50,960 --> 01:48:53,037
Kinda make you get that feelin'

1377
01:48:55,676 --> 01:48:57,587
Everybody's startin'

1378
01:48:59,183 --> 01:49:01,510
Use the pill and the dope

1379
01:49:03,482 --> 01:49:05,642
Educated fools

1380
01:49:06,988 --> 01:49:09,362
From uneducated schools

1381
01:49:13,333 --> 01:49:17,168
Right now we'd like to bring on a young man
who believes in doing things his own way.

1382
01:49:17,298 --> 01:49:20,587
And based on the way he kinda get next to
all of the folks who've seen him work...

1383
01:49:20,680 --> 01:49:22,258
his way has gotta be
pretty hip.

1384
01:49:22,349 --> 01:49:26,266
So let's lay some noise
on the mighty Al Green.

1385
01:49:33,536 --> 01:49:35,411
Apartment 13!

1386
01:49:36,583 --> 01:49:38,661
I'm so tired of bein' alone

1387
01:49:38,795 --> 01:49:41,169
I'm so tied up on my own

1388
01:49:41,258 --> 01:49:43,632
Won't you help me, girl

1389
01:49:43,720 --> 01:49:48,184
Just as soon as you can

1390
01:49:53,697 --> 01:49:55,905
Don't move, mister!

1391
01:49:56,034 --> 01:49:59,572
I been wantin' to get
next to you, baby

1392
01:49:59,707 --> 01:50:01,618
You see, sometime
I fold my arms, I say

1393
01:50:01,753 --> 01:50:05,255
- Ooo-ooo
- Mmm-hmm-mmm

1394
01:50:05,384 --> 01:50:07,877
Whoa-oh-oh

1395
01:50:08,014 --> 01:50:10,589
Oh, baby, hey

1396
01:50:12,104 --> 01:50:15,891
Needing you has proven to be

1397
01:50:15,986 --> 01:50:19,524
To be my greatest dream
Yeah

1398
01:50:19,618 --> 01:50:23,072
- I'm so tired of being alone
- Oh, tired, baby

1399
01:50:25,379 --> 01:50:27,705
- Here's the rest of the fifties.
- Put it in there.

1400
01:50:30,053 --> 01:50:33,888
You know, I still feel fucked-up
about this whole situation.

1401
01:50:33,977 --> 01:50:38,108
Look, feelin' fucked-up don't help a goddam
thing and it ain't gonna bring nobody back.

1402
01:50:38,234 --> 01:50:41,903
- Shit!
- So, just worry about yourself. We just gotta get outta here.

1403
01:50:41,991 --> 01:50:46,372
- Come on.
- Say, man, you got everything?

1404
01:50:46,499 --> 01:50:48,458
Yeah, grab that bag.

1405
01:50:50,757 --> 01:50:53,215
This is a bitch.

1406
01:50:53,345 --> 01:50:56,716
This is it, man.
This is it.

1407
01:50:56,851 --> 01:50:58,810
All we got to do, boy,
is make it to Mexico.

1408
01:50:58,938 --> 01:51:01,479
We'll be fine.
We'll get us a villa, see?

1409
01:51:01,610 --> 01:51:04,281
And then, and buy a boat
and sail all around the gulf.

1410
01:51:04,365 --> 01:51:07,368
Everything will be fine.
We just gotta get the fuck outta here.

1411
01:51:07,496 --> 01:51:09,739
Yeah, maybe I can send
for Sarah once we get down there.

1412
01:51:09,875 --> 01:51:12,830
Well, anything's possible.
Come on.

1413
01:51:12,963 --> 01:51:15,457
Wait a minute.
Run, Anthony! Hyah!

1414
01:51:15,552 --> 01:51:19,005
Y'all get back!
Get away right there! Get off me!

1415
01:51:20,685 --> 01:51:23,144
Shit!

1416
01:51:23,232 --> 01:51:26,852
- You pity fool, you pity fool
- Fuck!

1417
01:51:26,946 --> 01:51:29,903
You better have some sympathy

1418
01:51:30,036 --> 01:51:34,950
Yeah
'Cause there's educated people

1419
01:51:35,086 --> 01:51:38,789
Runnin' the lives of our society

1420
01:51:40,805 --> 01:51:42,431
Makin' up the rules

1421
01:51:44,220 --> 01:51:48,267
Mr Curtis, you have been
lawfully tried in this court...

1422
01:51:48,352 --> 01:51:50,680
and found guilty on all charges.

1423
01:51:50,774 --> 01:51:54,560
Do you have anything to say on your own
behalf before I pronounce sentence?

1424
01:51:54,697 --> 01:51:56,358
Uh...

1425
01:51:56,450 --> 01:51:59,537
no, ain't nothin' I say
gonna get me out of this.

1426
01:52:01,084 --> 01:52:04,585
But things were gettin' bad
for me, and...

1427
01:52:04,715 --> 01:52:07,291
I had to do what I had to do
to s... to survive.

1428
01:52:10,600 --> 01:52:12,594
Maybe it was wrong, but I...

1429
01:52:12,730 --> 01:52:15,401
I certainly didn't mean
for anybody to be hurt.

1430
01:52:15,484 --> 01:52:18,024
Uh, Your Honour,
please consider before sentencing...

1431
01:52:18,155 --> 01:52:21,112
that my client served his country proud
in the Marine Corps.

1432
01:52:21,245 --> 01:52:23,572
As a matter of fact, he was
a member of an elite unit...

1433
01:52:23,665 --> 01:52:25,743
a sergeant,
decorated with many medals.

1434
01:52:25,836 --> 01:52:29,967
In fact, one of those medals
was the, uh, Silver Star, for valour.

1435
01:52:30,052 --> 01:52:32,806
I realize that my client had
a difficult time adjusting when he...

1436
01:52:32,891 --> 01:52:35,680
Excuse me, Counsel.
I, too, was a marine...

1437
01:52:35,770 --> 01:52:39,558
and I served my country proudly
in World War Il, a real war, I may add.

1438
01:52:39,694 --> 01:52:41,569
- Yes, Your Honor...
- I'm not finished yet, please.

1439
01:52:41,698 --> 01:52:45,070
I received the Purple Heart
at Guadalcanal.

1440
01:52:45,204 --> 01:52:47,697
Now, this young man has obviously
forgotten some very...

1441
01:52:47,792 --> 01:52:52,089
fundamental things like decency
and dedication and honor...

1442
01:52:52,216 --> 01:52:53,926
everything the corps taught us.

1443
01:52:54,053 --> 01:52:56,628
He is a disgrace to everyone
that has ever put on that uniform...

1444
01:52:56,766 --> 01:53:02,061
and I will not permit you or him to use
the Vietnam War as a cop-out here.

1445
01:53:03,821 --> 01:53:07,109
Anthony Curtis, for your
participation in this crime...

1446
01:53:07,244 --> 01:53:10,911
a crime that took the lives of several
innocent people, I do hereby...

1447
01:53:11,001 --> 01:53:14,253
sentence you to the custody of the
Attorney General of the United States...

1448
01:53:14,339 --> 01:53:16,797
for a period of 15 years to life.

1449
01:53:16,927 --> 01:53:19,599
Oh, my God.

1450
01:53:19,682 --> 01:53:23,766
These proceedings are concluded.
This court is adjourned.

1451
01:53:23,857 --> 01:53:27,193
"Life"? What the fuck
he mean "life"?

1452
01:53:27,280 --> 01:53:29,772
After all the shit I did
for this motherfuckin' country?

1453
01:53:29,867 --> 01:53:33,156
What the fuck he talkin' about, "life"?
Man, fuck you! Fuck you!

1454
01:53:33,290 --> 01:53:35,201
- Hey!
- Oh, Anthony!

1455
01:53:35,336 --> 01:53:37,460
After all the shit I did
for this motherfuckin' country?

1456
01:53:37,548 --> 01:53:39,376
You, remove the prisoner
from the court!

1457
01:53:39,468 --> 01:53:42,554
- You hear me? - Fuck you! Fuck
you! - Restrain the prisoner!

1458
01:53:42,681 --> 01:53:46,018
Get him outta here! Let the record
show... Let the record show...

1459
01:53:46,146 --> 01:53:48,022
that a chair was thrown
at the judge.

1460
01:53:54,953 --> 01:53:56,829
Whoa, whoa

1461
01:54:03,302 --> 01:54:07,553
If you see me
walkin' down the street

1462
01:54:07,685 --> 01:54:10,557
And I start to cry

1463
01:54:10,648 --> 01:54:13,141
Each time we meet

1464
01:54:16,784 --> 01:54:18,743
Then walk on by

1465
01:54:22,419 --> 01:54:25,375
Walk on by

1466
01:54:27,637 --> 01:54:30,047
Make believe

1467
01:54:30,142 --> 01:54:33,810
That you don't see the tears

1468
01:54:35,108 --> 01:54:37,898
You just let me grieve
in private

1469
01:54:37,989 --> 01:54:41,277
'Cause each time I see you

1470
01:54:41,370 --> 01:54:46,166
I just can't help myself
I think about how tight we used to be

1471
01:54:46,296 --> 01:54:50,628
I break down and cry

1472
01:54:50,720 --> 01:54:52,761
Oh, baby

1473
01:54:52,849 --> 01:54:55,555
Walk on by

1474
01:55:05,287 --> 01:55:08,375
Hmm-mmm-mmm

1475
01:55:14,304 --> 01:55:18,886
I just can't get over
losing you

1476
01:55:19,020 --> 01:55:22,642
So if I seem

1477
01:55:22,736 --> 01:55:25,359
Broken in two

1478
01:55:27,870 --> 01:55:31,573
Please walk on by

1479
01:55:33,129 --> 01:55:35,752
Walk on by

1480
01:55:38,180 --> 01:55:40,720
Foolish pride

1481
01:55:40,851 --> 01:55:44,140
Is all that I have left

1482
01:55:44,274 --> 01:55:47,230
So let me hide

1483
01:55:47,321 --> 01:55:51,987
The tears and the sadness
you gave me

1484
01:55:52,122 --> 01:55:53,997
You put the hurt on me

1485
01:55:54,125 --> 01:55:56,001
You socked it to me, mama

1486
01:55:56,129 --> 01:56:01,008
When you said goodbye

1487
01:56:02,599 --> 01:56:06,053
So, please, walk on by

1488
01:56:08,025 --> 01:56:11,443
Make believe you never see
the tears I cry

1489
01:56:14,203 --> 01:56:16,114
So do me a favour

1490
01:56:16,248 --> 01:56:19,750
And walk on by

1491
01:56:21,507 --> 01:56:23,418
So I'm beggin' you to

1492
01:56:23,511 --> 01:56:26,135
Walk on by

1493
01:56:26,225 --> 01:56:27,968
Oh, yeah

1494
01:56:28,103 --> 01:56:31,022
And make believe you never see
the tears I cry

1495
01:56:33,028 --> 01:56:35,069
So I'm beggin' you
I'm beggin' you

1496
01:56:35,198 --> 01:56:37,489
To walk on by

1497
01:56:40,082 --> 01:56:43,370
Make believe you never see
the tears I cry

1498
01:56:46,344 --> 01:56:48,219
Oh

1499
01:56:48,347 --> 01:56:50,674
There's no dust in my eye

1500
01:56:50,810 --> 01:56:52,804
Oh, no

1501
01:56:54,692 --> 01:56:56,567
Smoke ain't makin' me cry

1502
01:56:56,696 --> 01:56:59,367
No, no, no

1503
01:56:59,492 --> 01:57:02,531
It's the hurt
you put on me, yeah

1504
01:57:04,543 --> 01:57:07,380
I don't want you
to see this man cry

1505
01:57:09,468 --> 01:57:14,298
Where is the love

1506
01:57:14,436 --> 01:57:24,407
Where is the love

1507
01:57:24,537 --> 01:57:26,781
Where is the love

1508
01:57:26,916 --> 01:57:29,243
Ooh, yeah, yeah

1509
01:57:29,379 --> 01:57:32,251
Where is the love

1510
01:57:32,342 --> 01:57:34,966
You said you'd give to me

1511
01:57:35,097 --> 01:57:37,590
Soon as you were free

1512
01:57:37,685 --> 01:57:41,982
Will it ever be

1513
01:57:42,109 --> 01:57:47,109
Where is the love

1514
01:57:48,831 --> 01:57:53,626
You told me that you
didn't love him

1515
01:57:53,714 --> 01:57:58,629
And you were gonna say goodbye

1516
01:57:58,765 --> 01:58:03,810
But if you really
didn't mean it

1517
01:58:03,899 --> 01:58:09,657
Why did you have to lie

1518
01:58:09,742 --> 01:58:12,663
Where is the love

1519
01:58:12,748 --> 01:58:15,502
You said was mine
all mine

1520
01:58:15,628 --> 01:58:18,168
Till the end of time

1521
01:58:18,257 --> 01:58:22,305
Was it just a lie

1522
01:58:22,390 --> 01:58:27,187
Where is the love

1523
01:58:29,111 --> 01:58:34,025
If you had had a sudden
change of heart

1524
01:58:34,119 --> 01:58:39,082
I wish that you
would tell me so

1525
01:58:39,212 --> 01:58:44,091
Don't leave me hangin'
on these promises

1526
01:58:44,221 --> 01:58:50,014
You've gotta let me know

1527
01:58:50,106 --> 01:58:52,681
Oh-ohh

1528
01:58:52,777 --> 01:58:57,823
Do-do do-do

1529
01:58:57,912 --> 01:59:02,661
Do-do do-do-do

1530
01:59:03,661 --> 01:59:13,661
