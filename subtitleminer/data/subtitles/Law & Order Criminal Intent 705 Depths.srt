In New York City's war on crime,

2
00:00:03,588 --> 00:00:06,778
the worst criminal offenders
are pursued by the detectives

3
00:00:06,778 --> 00:00:08,686
of the Major Case Squad.

4
00:00:08,686 --> 00:00:10,704
These are their stories.

5
00:00:14,166 --> 00:00:16,684
Allahu Akbar.

6
00:00:18,636 --> 00:00:21,129
Allahu Akbar.

7
00:00:22,524 --> 00:00:25,124
Allahu Akbar.

8
00:00:25,416 --> 00:00:27,874
Allahu Akbar.

9
00:01:05,876 --> 00:01:10,186
Chilly, don't leave these behind.
He wears bikinis.

10
00:02:20,951 --> 00:02:23,382
Cold beer.
Cold beer here.

11
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:26,618
Cold beer. Cold beer here.
Nice, cold beer.

12
00:02:26,618 --> 00:02:28,405
Cold beer.

13
00:02:28,847 --> 00:02:31,050
Cold beer. Cold beer.

14
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:34,332
Dude, look what I found.

15
00:02:34,586 --> 00:02:36,300
This is awesome.

16
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,363
It's probably worth a lot of money.

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON USA: 2007/11/01

28
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:48,574
Floater in a scuba suit washing up
on the hottest day of the year.

29
00:03:48,574 --> 00:03:51,207
No ID.
He might have been stabbed.

30
00:03:51,207 --> 00:03:54,051
I hate the beach.
Why call major case?

31
00:03:54,051 --> 00:03:56,962
Someone called the FBI
told them he looked Middle Eastern.

32
00:03:56,962 --> 00:03:58,735
Thought you'd want to get here
before they did.

33
00:03:58,735 --> 00:04:01,532
What about the coast guard?
Anyone call in a missing diver?

34
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:02,911
Not in two weeks.

35
00:04:02,911 --> 00:04:05,004
Seems fresher than that.

36
00:04:07,962 --> 00:04:12,221
Yeah, his corneas,
they're not even cloudy.

37
00:04:12,221 --> 00:04:14,641
He's been in the water
less than a day.

38
00:04:14,641 --> 00:04:16,564
And who decided
that he was Middle Eastern?

39
00:04:16,564 --> 00:04:20,860
I mean, take a look around.
Half our CSU guys look like him.

40
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:25,456
Digital camera might
have a date stamp.

41
00:04:25,456 --> 00:04:27,599
Might even have a picture of his killer.

42
00:04:27,599 --> 00:04:30,770
We got entry wounds...
Right here on his side.

43
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,656
Something penetrated his suit.

44
00:04:32,656 --> 00:04:34,390
And slashed his air tube.

45
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:36,650
It's a closed circuit re-breather.

46
00:04:36,995 --> 00:04:39,669
Agent Corbett, FBI.

47
00:04:40,011 --> 00:04:41,850
Instead of exhaling into the water,

48
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:44,127
the diver breathes out
to that CO2 scrubber.

49
00:04:44,127 --> 00:04:46,371
Come back at him as oxygen.

50
00:04:46,882 --> 00:04:49,180
No bubbles.
Technical divers use it

51
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,333
when they stay underwater
for long periods of time.

52
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,148
Or a terrorist who doesn't
wanna be detected

53
00:04:53,148 --> 00:04:56,648
while he's taking pictures of
our underwater gas lines.

54
00:04:57,098 --> 00:04:59,017
So you think he's a terrorist?

55
00:04:59,017 --> 00:05:02,165
Why else would someone
go diving in this muck?

56
00:05:02,165 --> 00:05:03,732
It's late summer, you know.

57
00:05:03,732 --> 00:05:07,793
Gulf stream brings in non-native
species from the Caribbean.

58
00:05:07,793 --> 00:05:11,165
Yeah, butterfly fish.
You know angel fish.

59
00:05:11,165 --> 00:05:13,268
You'd be surprised.

60
00:05:13,496 --> 00:05:17,824
If I find any pictures of Nemo,
you'll be the first one I call.

61
00:05:28,272 --> 00:05:30,794
He drowned?
He was stabbed.

62
00:05:30,794 --> 00:05:34,314
Twice. In the side.
Pierced his kidney.

63
00:05:34,314 --> 00:05:37,588
Didn't kill him, but made it hard for him
to swim to the surface.

64
00:05:37,588 --> 00:05:39,060
What was he stabbed with?

65
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,848
Based on the morphology
of the wound blunt on top,

66
00:05:41,848 --> 00:05:44,446
serrated on the bottom,
a notch right there,

67
00:05:44,446 --> 00:05:46,623
it'd be something like this.

68
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:48,990
This knife's his,
but the killer would have had his own.

69
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:51,950
And they say it's safer
to dive with a partner.

70
00:05:52,232 --> 00:05:53,951
Good morning, Rogers.

71
00:05:53,951 --> 00:05:54,947
Captain.

72
00:05:54,947 --> 00:05:58,862
FBI matched the prints from the body
with a British national.

73
00:05:58,862 --> 00:06:00,549
They give you a name?

74
00:06:00,549 --> 00:06:02,687
We've been summoned.

75
00:06:03,241 --> 00:06:07,232
Our lab managed to salvage these photos.
From the diver's camera.

76
00:06:07,232 --> 00:06:10,018
Underwater natural gas line.

77
00:06:11,059 --> 00:06:13,216
Holland Tunnel.

78
00:06:14,737 --> 00:06:17,697
Retaining wall near the UN.

79
00:06:17,697 --> 00:06:20,158
All high value targets.

80
00:06:20,158 --> 00:06:22,273
As for the deceased,

81
00:06:22,273 --> 00:06:24,854
inspector Lindsay
from Scotland yard will take over.

82
00:06:24,854 --> 00:06:27,304
Diver's name is Tarek Agiza.

83
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:29,964
Goes by the western name of Rick.

84
00:06:29,964 --> 00:06:32,062
29, born in Egypt.

85
00:06:32,062 --> 00:06:35,348
Comes from a scholarly family
of Islamic extremists.

86
00:06:35,348 --> 00:06:38,751
- Which one, Jamaat Al-Islamiyya?
- You got it.

87
00:06:38,751 --> 00:06:42,274
His father and grandfather
have been active since the 70s.

88
00:06:42,274 --> 00:06:45,940
Rick has mostly managed
to stay under the radar.

89
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,095
Mostly?

90
00:06:47,095 --> 00:06:49,741
You arrested him for something
non-terror related?

91
00:06:49,741 --> 00:06:51,529
Yeah, for public drunkenness in 2000.

92
00:06:51,529 --> 00:06:54,576
Shortly after he arrived in London
to start University.

93
00:06:54,576 --> 00:06:56,220
He dropped out after 9/11.

94
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:59,341
Since then, Rick has traveled
extensively to Muslim countries.

95
00:06:59,341 --> 00:07:04,880
Or ones with large Muslim communities.
Croatia, New Zealand, Indonesia.

96
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,094
New Zealand. Wow.

97
00:07:09,305 --> 00:07:14,037
Is there a large community
of Muslims in New Zealand?

98
00:07:14,037 --> 00:07:16,780
Relatively small, but growing fast.

99
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:19,083
All this travel,
how's he pay for it?

100
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:21,338
He has no known job,
but look in his bank account,

101
00:07:21,338 --> 00:07:24,996
and, oh my, erratic deposits
of large amounts of cash.

102
00:07:24,996 --> 00:07:29,039
So, protocol, we'll continue with
the murder investigation.

103
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,255
While we track down
the rest of Rick's cell.

104
00:07:31,255 --> 00:07:36,264
Remember, Patriot Act gives us
certain liberties regarding searches.

105
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:38,711
We'll keep each other posted.

106
00:07:38,938 --> 00:07:42,362
Hopefully Rick's terror cell
won't get past the research stage.

107
00:07:42,362 --> 00:07:45,814
Rick dropped out of college
and was arrested for drinking.

108
00:07:45,814 --> 00:07:48,328
Aren't terrorist supposed
to be a little more disciplined than that?

109
00:07:48,328 --> 00:07:51,064
Well, with his family history,
maybe he didn't wanna fit the profile.

110
00:07:51,064 --> 00:07:53,631
Yeah, or maybe he's just
the black sheep of the family.

111
00:07:53,631 --> 00:07:58,256
And his travel.
Could be another explanation.

112
00:07:59,188 --> 00:08:01,823
We gotta go back to Coney Island.

113
00:08:02,163 --> 00:08:05,378
I'm out here every day, I told you.

114
00:08:08,712 --> 00:08:12,697
You keep on ignoring
the beeps, why is that?

115
00:08:12,945 --> 00:08:16,293
Can you tell the difference between
a bottle cap and a coin with that thing?

116
00:08:16,293 --> 00:08:18,598
Oh, yeah, yeah.
It beeps different.

117
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:22,034
My partner, he loves Gadgets.

118
00:08:23,062 --> 00:08:27,053
I hid a bottle cap and a coin.
Tell me which is which.

119
00:08:30,865 --> 00:08:33,703
- There's your bottle cap.
- Yeah?

120
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,752
That's coin.

121
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:41,356
That's another coin.

122
00:08:41,356 --> 00:08:43,684
This a new hobby for you, Walter?

123
00:08:43,684 --> 00:08:46,091
Yesterday, when the body washed up,

124
00:08:46,091 --> 00:08:50,242
you and a bunch of guys
were looking for something. What?

125
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,600
Dammit, I gave that kid ten bucks
and an icy for that coin.

126
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,787
And I let him keep the fish
he found it in.

127
00:08:56,787 --> 00:08:58,320
A fish with a coin in its mouth?

128
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,051
Where did you read that,
in the Bible, Walter?

129
00:09:00,051 --> 00:09:02,587
In its belly.
Bluefish will eat anything.

130
00:09:02,587 --> 00:09:04,704
I don't believe it.

131
00:09:13,331 --> 00:09:15,715
We're gonna wanna borrow this.

132
00:09:15,715 --> 00:09:18,121
You just, um...

133
00:09:21,535 --> 00:09:23,792
It's an 1861 double eagle.

134
00:09:23,792 --> 00:09:25,103
Is this what Rick was after?

135
00:09:25,103 --> 00:09:27,662
Exotic travel, unexplained cash.

136
00:09:27,662 --> 00:09:31,874
Rick wasn't a terrorist.
He was a treasure hunter.

137
00:10:10,664 --> 00:10:14,862
- I'll take one of those.
- What, you still don't trust me?

138
00:10:20,294 --> 00:10:22,175
Where's Rick? Huh?

139
00:10:22,175 --> 00:10:23,618
- What?
- What's he doing?

140
00:10:23,618 --> 00:10:26,152
I don't know.
I swear to God I don't know.

141
00:10:45,367 --> 00:10:47,420
Okay.

142
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:50,509
All right. Have it your way.

143
00:10:50,509 --> 00:10:53,704
One key for you, one key for me.

144
00:10:53,704 --> 00:10:57,998
Until we hear from Rick...
You and me stick together.

145
00:11:08,613 --> 00:11:10,124
What do we know about the diver?

146
00:11:10,124 --> 00:11:13,926
Every country Rick Agiza traveled
to has a coast known for wreck diving.

147
00:11:13,926 --> 00:11:15,253
Including here.

148
00:11:15,253 --> 00:11:20,036
This area between Long Island
and New Jersey, it's called wreck valley.

149
00:11:20,036 --> 00:11:22,017
Each X marks a sunken ship.

150
00:11:22,017 --> 00:11:23,925
Well, it marks some of them.
There are thousands.

151
00:11:23,925 --> 00:11:27,922
Dating back to the 1600s.
Privateer ships, gunrunners, slave ships.

152
00:11:27,922 --> 00:11:32,094
So Rick's dive partner killed him
then framed him as a terrorist.

153
00:11:32,094 --> 00:11:34,553
Modern day pirates
still killing over treasure.

154
00:11:34,553 --> 00:11:37,296
Divers and recovery companies
are supposed to file for permission

155
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:40,196
before bringing anything up,
so check the court records,

156
00:11:40,196 --> 00:11:41,743
but don't hold your breath.

157
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:46,855
You know, one 1861 gold coin
sells for around $3,000.

158
00:11:46,855 --> 00:11:48,645
You mean sold for 3,000.

159
00:11:48,645 --> 00:11:53,715
In the last two days, prices have
dropped on several civil war-era coins.

160
00:11:56,362 --> 00:11:59,005
I'd give you 800 bucks.

161
00:11:59,276 --> 00:12:03,796
Well, for Pete's sake,
it's a 150 years old.

162
00:12:03,796 --> 00:12:07,006
The numismatic market
is extremely volatile.

163
00:12:07,006 --> 00:12:09,313
- Take it somewhere else.
- We already did.

164
00:12:09,313 --> 00:12:11,572
They said you're the guy
who buys stolen coins.

165
00:12:11,572 --> 00:12:13,171
Oh, man. Those were stolen?

166
00:12:13,171 --> 00:12:15,649
No, she told me that she inherited them
from her great aunt.

167
00:12:15,649 --> 00:12:17,536
She. Let me guess,

168
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:20,544
she was pretty
and you didn't ask questions.

169
00:12:20,544 --> 00:12:23,592
Between you and I, she was smokin'.

170
00:12:23,804 --> 00:12:25,094
How smokin'?

171
00:12:25,094 --> 00:12:27,317
Kinda old. Like, 28.

172
00:12:27,317 --> 00:12:30,595
But kickass body,
short, blond hair.

173
00:12:30,801 --> 00:12:32,905
Did she bring any double eagles?

174
00:12:32,905 --> 00:12:35,005
Maybe a couple.

175
00:12:35,005 --> 00:12:36,299
Or more.

176
00:12:36,299 --> 00:12:39,196
I checked the police sheet.
None of these were reported stolen.

177
00:12:39,196 --> 00:12:41,600
Did you even ask for ID?

178
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,116
I was asking for her license,
but she flew out of here.

179
00:12:44,116 --> 00:12:46,091
- She was getting a ticket.
- Yeah, right.

180
00:12:46,091 --> 00:12:49,855
No, really, she was parked
in front of the hydrant.

181
00:12:50,131 --> 00:12:52,902
Meter maid wouldn't cut her a break.

182
00:12:54,155 --> 00:12:57,113
I got 9 company cars
and 15 authorized drivers.

183
00:12:57,113 --> 00:12:58,960
I have no idea who got this ticket.

184
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,809
So this would be the bright pink
Benz convertible

185
00:13:01,809 --> 00:13:04,975
driven by a smokin blond with a great body.

186
00:13:04,975 --> 00:13:07,290
Maybe your girlfriend.

187
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:09,022
Somebody you'd want to be your girlfriend.

188
00:13:09,022 --> 00:13:11,628
She's my wife, buddy.

189
00:13:13,342 --> 00:13:15,710
Dana and I are separated.

190
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:18,766
- Recently?
- Two years ago.

191
00:13:18,766 --> 00:13:20,863
But she still works with you
here at Camelot.

192
00:13:20,863 --> 00:13:22,995
No, not for two years.

193
00:13:22,995 --> 00:13:25,215
Dana's a diver. It's...

194
00:13:25,215 --> 00:13:29,269
one of two things
she has a special talent for.

195
00:13:29,567 --> 00:13:33,926
She ever dive with a guy named
Rick Agiza?

196
00:13:35,501 --> 00:13:37,218
I wouldn't know.

197
00:13:37,218 --> 00:13:38,792
We're out of touch.

198
00:13:38,792 --> 00:13:41,202
What's the last address
you have for her, Mr. Stipe?

199
00:13:41,202 --> 00:13:44,847
It's a condo on Manhattan beach
two years old.

200
00:13:44,847 --> 00:13:47,382
I gave her the down payment.

201
00:13:47,752 --> 00:13:49,678
Do me a favor.

202
00:13:49,678 --> 00:13:52,912
Tell her to pay
her own parking tickets.

203
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:02,609
Guess she didn't bother to tell Stipe

204
00:14:02,609 --> 00:14:05,410
she cashed out his condo
and traded down for this.

205
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:07,053
Wait for a warrant?

206
00:14:07,053 --> 00:14:11,328
I don't know, it's still an active
terror investigation.

207
00:14:13,555 --> 00:14:17,980
I got three pairs of Jimmy Choo heels.

208
00:14:18,585 --> 00:14:21,300
Four Versace dressed, never worn.

209
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:24,374
Looks like Dana went on a shopping spree.

210
00:14:26,233 --> 00:14:27,835
Eames.

211
00:14:32,147 --> 00:14:35,091
I've got Rick Agiza's passport.

212
00:14:35,445 --> 00:14:38,016
So he's staying here?

213
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:46,356
I can see a European in these.

214
00:14:47,496 --> 00:14:49,401
But these?

215
00:14:50,874 --> 00:14:52,534
Different size.

216
00:14:52,534 --> 00:14:55,637
Another guy.
Dana's been busy.

217
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:07,727
Last call was from Camelot.

218
00:15:07,727 --> 00:15:10,510
Maybe Stipe did know she moved.

219
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:13,889
- 2:00 pm.
- Right after we left.

220
00:15:13,889 --> 00:15:18,105
So he sent us on a goose chase
and then tipped her off.

221
00:15:21,972 --> 00:15:24,815
Uh, excuse me, Mr. Harper.

222
00:15:26,002 --> 00:15:28,218
- Do I know you?
- My name's Chilly.

223
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:30,293
I work with Rick.

224
00:15:30,793 --> 00:15:34,402
I need to talk to you
about the expedition.

225
00:15:34,402 --> 00:15:39,257
Uh, Derek, why don't you
get us a couple lattes?

226
00:15:43,672 --> 00:15:46,044
I'm not sure if you know this,

227
00:15:46,044 --> 00:15:48,368
but we found something down there.

228
00:15:48,368 --> 00:15:50,702
A lot more than Rick told you about.

229
00:15:50,702 --> 00:15:53,485
It's gonna cost a lot to bring it out.

230
00:15:54,455 --> 00:15:57,263
I didn't tip Dana off.

231
00:15:57,263 --> 00:15:59,281
I called to tell her
I want my car back.

232
00:15:59,281 --> 00:16:01,399
You're a bad liar, Mr. Stipe.

233
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:05,084
Which brings us
to your wife's lover, Rick Agiza.

234
00:16:05,084 --> 00:16:06,502
Sure you don't remember him?

235
00:16:06,502 --> 00:16:11,255
Yeah, okay, Rick did a job for me
in Charleston a few years ago.

236
00:16:11,677 --> 00:16:14,768
He was trying to con my clients
into financing his expedition.

237
00:16:14,768 --> 00:16:16,500
- Now, if you will excuse me...
- Hey, hey, hey...

238
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:21,882
You think we could see a picture of Dana?
You don't happen to have one, do you?

239
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,113
Wow, she's beautiful.

240
00:16:30,997 --> 00:16:34,233
Guess you could see it
all day long right there.

241
00:16:34,974 --> 00:16:36,932
Guess you're still in love with her, huh?

242
00:16:36,932 --> 00:16:40,039
Makes me wonder how far
you'd go to get her back.

243
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:42,459
Maybe this far?

244
00:16:43,425 --> 00:16:47,339
Someone killed Rick
while he was still underwater.

245
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:50,655
- I had nothing to do with this.
- Come on, man.

246
00:16:50,655 --> 00:16:54,626
You own of the largest wreck recovery
businesses in the east coast.

247
00:16:54,626 --> 00:16:58,779
You're telling me that you had nothing to do
with Dana's dive in wreck valley.

248
00:16:58,779 --> 00:17:00,306
I can't dive.

249
00:17:00,306 --> 00:17:03,351
I tore my labyrinthine
membrane five years ago.

250
00:17:05,602 --> 00:17:07,631
All right, then it's not you, it's Dana.

251
00:17:07,631 --> 00:17:10,706
Dana would never willingly go along
with something like this.

252
00:17:10,706 --> 00:17:12,562
Willingly?

253
00:17:14,092 --> 00:17:17,660
Yesterday, when I called to ask her
what this was all about,

254
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:22,179
she sounded... off, like someone else
was in the room.

255
00:17:22,179 --> 00:17:23,446
Did you hear a voice?

256
00:17:23,446 --> 00:17:27,641
No, but I know Dana's.
I could hear fear in it.

257
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,083
And that's why I told her
to get out of there.

258
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,441
And go where?

259
00:17:32,441 --> 00:17:34,289
Well, how would I know?

260
00:17:34,736 --> 00:17:38,514
Before yesterday, I hadn't
talked to her in over a year.

261
00:17:40,715 --> 00:17:43,166
They found Dana Stipe's
pink Benz at JFK,

262
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:44,882
but there's no flight record.

263
00:17:44,882 --> 00:17:48,122
And she hasn't used her credit
card or cell phone since yesterday.

264
00:17:48,122 --> 00:17:51,052
And we believe Stipe when he says
he hasn't been in contact with her.

265
00:17:51,052 --> 00:17:52,161
I pulled his LUDs.

266
00:17:52,161 --> 00:17:54,928
He called her obsessively
for the first six months,

267
00:17:54,928 --> 00:17:57,880
then went cold turkey till yesterday.

268
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,774
Doesn't rule out Stipe
as Agiza's murderer.

269
00:18:00,774 --> 00:18:02,006
That's all we need to know.

270
00:18:02,006 --> 00:18:07,036
So Stipe's doctor confirms that
he has an inner ear condition.

271
00:18:07,036 --> 00:18:09,223
He can only dive as deep as a pool.

272
00:18:09,223 --> 00:18:13,159
Well, then maybe he captained the boat
and Dana killed Agiza.

273
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:14,378
Or maybe there's a third man.

274
00:18:14,378 --> 00:18:17,834
Stipe told us that he sensed
someone else in the room

275
00:18:17,834 --> 00:18:19,896
threatening Dana
when he spoke to her.

276
00:18:19,896 --> 00:18:24,554
And we did find two different sizes
of men's underwear at her place.

277
00:18:24,554 --> 00:18:26,917
If there was someone else
on the treasure dive,

278
00:18:26,917 --> 00:18:30,202
whoever funded the expedition
might know who it was.

279
00:18:30,202 --> 00:18:32,005
Take a look at Stipe's investor list.

280
00:18:32,005 --> 00:18:34,670
Tell him we'll subpoena
if he doesn't hand it over.

281
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:42,471
I met Rick on a dive I funded in Charleston.

282
00:18:42,471 --> 00:18:45,510
The Philomela?
Tom Stipe said it was a civil war wreck.

283
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:47,647
Yes, they never found it.

284
00:18:47,647 --> 00:18:51,191
And then over Christmas
I bumped into Rick in St. Bart's.

285
00:18:51,191 --> 00:18:53,315
Was he with this woman?

286
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:56,916
No.

287
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:59,100
That was the first time
Rick and I hung out.

288
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:02,959
He's charismatic.
Great ocean stories.

289
00:19:02,959 --> 00:19:05,396
My wife and I were enthralled.

290
00:19:05,396 --> 00:19:07,162
Well, after enthralling you,

291
00:19:07,162 --> 00:19:10,115
did he approach you
about the dive in wreck valley?

292
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:14,220
Yes, he said he had a good lead
on a revolutionary war era ship.

293
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,797
Revolutionary war?

294
00:19:15,797 --> 00:19:19,011
We were told that it was civil war era.

295
00:19:19,011 --> 00:19:22,142
Must be a different expedition.

296
00:19:22,944 --> 00:19:24,530
Excuse me.

297
00:19:25,918 --> 00:19:28,948
Here's a copy of his proposal.

298
00:19:29,493 --> 00:19:32,437
Maps, sketches, budget.

299
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:36,049
The HMS Falkirk.
After the battle.

300
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:38,640
We don't have any record
of you applying for ownership.

301
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,423
Well, Rick said they hadn't...
found anything yet.

302
00:19:41,423 --> 00:19:44,270
I've been calling him for days.

303
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:48,991
He won't be calling you back.
Rick's body washed up on Monday.

304
00:19:50,504 --> 00:19:53,789
Oh, my God.

305
00:19:56,293 --> 00:20:00,349
I didn't realize...

306
00:20:00,349 --> 00:20:03,514
Something you're not
telling us, Mr. Harper?

307
00:20:04,602 --> 00:20:10,598
Yesterday I was approached by this man
who called himself Chilly.

308
00:20:10,598 --> 00:20:12,384
He said he's working on the dive.

309
00:20:12,384 --> 00:20:15,543
And that Rick took off
with my seed money.

310
00:20:15,543 --> 00:20:17,885
50 grand.

311
00:20:18,503 --> 00:20:19,901
You call the cops?

312
00:20:19,901 --> 00:20:22,368
I was waiting to hear
Rick's side of the story.

313
00:20:22,368 --> 00:20:26,353
This man, Chilly, he knew Rick
wasn't coming back.

314
00:20:26,353 --> 00:20:29,545
Did he want money?
To further the expedition?

315
00:20:29,545 --> 00:20:33,502
Yes, he wanted half a million to launch
a full-scale operation.

316
00:20:33,502 --> 00:20:36,011
I tried to get a number, an address.

317
00:20:36,011 --> 00:20:39,107
He said he lived on a boat.
That' he'd get in touch with me.

318
00:20:39,107 --> 00:20:41,326
What'd he look like?

319
00:20:41,326 --> 00:20:46,269
Six foot. Athletic, tan.
I'm not good with faces.

320
00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:49,792
Detectives, this is my wife Trisha.

321
00:20:53,621 --> 00:20:56,785
You're, uh... congratulations.

322
00:20:56,785 --> 00:20:58,063
Thank you.

323
00:20:58,063 --> 00:20:59,461
- Are we done here?
- Yes.

324
00:20:59,461 --> 00:21:02,376
If... if you hear from your
friend again, Mr. Harper,

325
00:21:02,376 --> 00:21:05,075
- give us a call.
- I certainly will.

326
00:21:05,075 --> 00:21:06,955
You don't by chance
know what you're having?

327
00:21:06,955 --> 00:21:08,417
A boy.

328
00:21:08,417 --> 00:21:10,030
Simon Harper IV?

329
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:12,645
Oh, we were thinking of Josiah.

330
00:21:13,001 --> 00:21:14,646
Nice.

331
00:21:16,659 --> 00:21:19,614
Well, if he was hanging out
at a marina with Dana,

332
00:21:19,614 --> 00:21:22,045
someone will remember her.

333
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:25,429
Sure, who wouldn't remember her?

334
00:21:25,429 --> 00:21:27,934
A girl like that who can
captain a grand banks?

335
00:21:27,934 --> 00:21:30,842
- She have her own boat?
- Nah.

336
00:21:30,842 --> 00:21:32,983
She and some guy worked Chilly's boat.

337
00:21:32,983 --> 00:21:34,743
Chilly?

338
00:21:35,026 --> 00:21:37,108
He's the treasure hunter, right?

339
00:21:38,098 --> 00:21:41,700
Takes people fishing, dives.
You know, anything to make a buck.

340
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,397
- His boat here now?
- It was here at sunrise.

341
00:21:44,397 --> 00:21:46,646
But when I got back at 3:00,
it was gone.

342
00:21:48,192 --> 00:21:49,964
All right, thanks.

343
00:22:29,746 --> 00:22:34,268
Well, it doesn't look like Chilly's boat
was headed towards Harper's treasure.

344
00:22:34,268 --> 00:22:36,718
Wreck site is closer to Southern Jersey.

345
00:22:36,718 --> 00:22:40,053
The suspects went in the opposite direction,
heading northeast.

346
00:22:40,053 --> 00:22:42,243
Hugging the coast
of Long Island for an hour.

347
00:22:42,243 --> 00:22:43,981
Then they shut off their GPS.

348
00:22:43,981 --> 00:22:46,505
Chilly's boat should be in this area.

349
00:23:04,575 --> 00:23:06,340
Dana Stipe.

350
00:23:07,496 --> 00:23:09,162
Chilly?

351
00:23:13,958 --> 00:23:16,720
Someone pulled the anchor.

352
00:23:17,066 --> 00:23:20,095
There's no one on this ship.
It's a ghost ship.

353
00:23:40,387 --> 00:23:44,452
So they used these lift bags
to bring up the buckets of coins.

354
00:23:45,105 --> 00:23:47,200
Could be Dana's size.

355
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,531
I found a computer.

356
00:23:52,841 --> 00:23:54,662
Still wet.

357
00:24:01,126 --> 00:24:04,813
In the trash.
A folder named Rick.

358
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:12,757
Those are the photos from the FBI
from Rick's camera.

359
00:24:12,757 --> 00:24:15,524
On Chilly's computer.

360
00:24:16,161 --> 00:24:21,310
Chilly might have framed Rick
as a terrorist before he killed him.

361
00:24:22,066 --> 00:24:25,951
So, Dana and Chilly, they took
the rest of the treasure.

362
00:24:25,951 --> 00:24:28,593
Staged their disappearance.

363
00:24:29,717 --> 00:24:32,652
If they did, they'd need another boat.

364
00:24:32,652 --> 00:24:35,506
I wonder where Dana would go to get one.

365
00:24:35,915 --> 00:24:37,431
Yeah, that's Chilly.

366
00:24:37,431 --> 00:24:40,506
His real name is Stan Chilton.

367
00:24:40,506 --> 00:24:44,601
Used him as a day hire on charter boats.

368
00:24:44,601 --> 00:24:47,597
He's working with Dana?

369
00:24:47,862 --> 00:24:50,300
It looks like more than that.

370
00:24:50,679 --> 00:24:53,323
From you to Rick to Chilly.

371
00:24:53,323 --> 00:24:55,491
Dana's trading down.

372
00:24:55,491 --> 00:25:00,913
You're the only one who actually...
cared about Dana, aren't you?

373
00:25:02,587 --> 00:25:06,985
Come on, Mr. Stipe.
Where is she?

374
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:08,452
I don't know.

375
00:25:08,452 --> 00:25:11,385
Yesterday afternoon where were you?

376
00:25:14,436 --> 00:25:19,199
I was on my way to see
a client in Connecticut.

377
00:25:21,323 --> 00:25:24,918
Dana is like...
she's like a black widow.

378
00:25:24,918 --> 00:25:28,608
Isn't she? And you're just staring at that
red hourglass on her belly.

379
00:25:28,608 --> 00:25:31,949
And you're just thinking
that she's not gonna bite.

380
00:25:40,742 --> 00:25:42,371
Stipe's covering for Dana.

381
00:25:42,371 --> 00:25:46,871
I can't tell if he's in on it,
or if he's protecting her out of stupidity.

382
00:25:46,871 --> 00:25:49,960
Meanwhile, Dana's probably
on some beach with Chilly.

383
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:53,937
Unlikely. A fishing boat found Chilly's body
off the coast of Fire Island.

384
00:25:53,937 --> 00:25:56,710
According to Rogers,
it's not a pretty picture.

385
00:25:56,710 --> 00:26:00,956
Whether Stipe's stupid or in on it,
he's lying.

386
00:26:00,956 --> 00:26:03,148
Call the coast guard
and the harbor unit.

387
00:26:03,148 --> 00:26:07,206
Have them search every boat
owned by Camelot undersea recovery.

388
00:26:10,487 --> 00:26:13,501
I'll add this to the list of "things
I didn't need to see."

389
00:26:13,501 --> 00:26:16,639
Worst example of Caisson disease
I've ever seen.

390
00:26:16,639 --> 00:26:19,564
The bends are rarely fatal.
What killed him? An embolism?

391
00:26:19,564 --> 00:26:20,830
Yeah.

392
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:23,542
The excess nitrogen
formed bubbles in his blood,

393
00:26:23,542 --> 00:26:25,716
one of them got to his heart
and stopped it.

394
00:26:25,716 --> 00:26:30,388
But he'd know better
than to ascend too quickly.

395
00:26:30,388 --> 00:26:32,907
Something made him panic.

396
00:26:33,197 --> 00:26:35,302
Like the sight of his anchor pulling up?

397
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:36,957
It was on the deck of his boat.

398
00:26:36,957 --> 00:26:39,039
He was in open water?

399
00:26:39,509 --> 00:26:41,186
That'd do it.

400
00:26:41,428 --> 00:26:43,761
Yeah, Goren.

401
00:26:43,761 --> 00:26:46,454
Okay, thanks.
Harbor unit found Dana.

402
00:26:46,667 --> 00:26:50,466
I should have gone to the cops
when Rick disappeared,

403
00:26:50,466 --> 00:26:52,681
but I panicked.

404
00:26:52,681 --> 00:26:54,497
I can get helpless.

405
00:26:54,497 --> 00:26:56,378
It's not my best side.

406
00:26:56,378 --> 00:27:00,265
So you turned to Chilly for support.

407
00:27:00,524 --> 00:27:02,463
Is that what he told you?

408
00:27:03,187 --> 00:27:06,122
I had to sleep with Chilly.

409
00:27:06,122 --> 00:27:08,497
He thought Rick and I
were cheating him,

410
00:27:08,497 --> 00:27:11,937
and I just wanted to show him
that he could trust me.

411
00:27:11,937 --> 00:27:13,947
That helpless thing again.

412
00:27:13,947 --> 00:27:20,888
How much treasure did the three of you...
bring up, Dana?

413
00:27:20,888 --> 00:27:24,911
Just a handful, I swear.

414
00:27:24,911 --> 00:27:28,550
Enough to buy three pairs of Jimmy Choos
and four Versace dresses.

415
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:34,073
And those diamond earrings
really highlight your tan.

416
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:38,482
Okay, so we skimmed
a little bit off the top.

417
00:27:38,482 --> 00:27:41,049
What, you've never worked as a waitress?

418
00:27:41,728 --> 00:27:45,132
Blonde like you?
I'm sure you did.

419
00:27:45,583 --> 00:27:48,747
I mean, Rick and Chilly said that there's
so many trunks down there,

420
00:27:48,747 --> 00:27:51,441
nobody was gonna miss
a handful of coins.

421
00:27:51,441 --> 00:27:54,060
What about your employer,
Simon Harper?

422
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:57,519
Well, Rick said Harper
didn't care about the money.

423
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:00,303
He was just looking for a thrill.

424
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:04,484
I had no idea that Rick was dead
until Tommy called me.

425
00:28:04,484 --> 00:28:07,207
Tommy. Tom Stipe,
your ex-husband.

426
00:28:07,207 --> 00:28:08,837
Yeah.

427
00:28:08,837 --> 00:28:11,329
He called when I was with Chilly.

428
00:28:11,329 --> 00:28:13,566
And he somehow sensed
that I was in trouble.

429
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:18,192
So he said to go hide out
on our old boat, The Guinevere.

430
00:28:18,421 --> 00:28:20,450
He'd take care of me.

431
00:28:26,591 --> 00:28:28,375
That's nice.

432
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:35,753
Let's see. He did.
He took care of you.

433
00:28:36,025 --> 00:28:38,062
Oh, my God.

434
00:28:40,522 --> 00:28:44,532
Well, don't get all helpless now.
You have a bigger problem.

435
00:28:44,532 --> 00:28:48,097
We have evidence
you were on Chilly's boat.

436
00:28:50,047 --> 00:28:51,972
You can't think I did this.

437
00:28:51,972 --> 00:28:53,914
Oh, now I can.

438
00:28:54,207 --> 00:28:57,426
Yeah. Well, you sent Chilly
down for the treasure.

439
00:28:57,426 --> 00:29:01,893
You had Tom come along
with one of his boats.

440
00:29:01,893 --> 00:29:03,139
You know, you went away.

441
00:29:03,139 --> 00:29:05,798
You left Chilly to claw his way
to the surface.

442
00:29:05,798 --> 00:29:10,498
No, I've been dry docked
on Tommy's boat for the last two days.

443
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,240
Where's you stash, Dana?

444
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:18,408
It... it's at a warehouse.

445
00:29:18,408 --> 00:29:21,127
Chilly and I each had a key.

446
00:29:35,748 --> 00:29:38,739
You gotta be freaking kidding me!
Damn it.

447
00:29:38,739 --> 00:29:40,707
Someone other than Chilly have the key?

448
00:29:40,707 --> 00:29:44,658
No. No, I bought the locks myself.
It was just me and him.

449
00:29:44,658 --> 00:29:46,325
You guys show anybody else
where the treasure was?

450
00:29:46,325 --> 00:29:49,796
No... why would... I...

451
00:29:52,959 --> 00:29:56,159
Oh... Tommy.

452
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:00,087
That baldheaded little bastard.

453
00:30:00,087 --> 00:30:02,710
I should have known never to trust him.

454
00:30:04,483 --> 00:30:07,114
Chilly is a loose cannon.

455
00:30:07,114 --> 00:30:10,076
With the money involved,
I knew he was a threat to Dana.

456
00:30:10,076 --> 00:30:14,334
I gave her a port in the storm.

457
00:30:14,334 --> 00:30:21,664
Well, this is the chance you've been
waiting for with Dana, isn't it?

458
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:23,208
How's that?

459
00:30:23,208 --> 00:30:26,358
Well, a chance to restore... Camelot.

460
00:30:26,358 --> 00:30:29,398
You know, Dana's your Guinevere.

461
00:30:29,398 --> 00:30:32,535
Name of the boat that we found her on.
That's sweet.

462
00:30:32,535 --> 00:30:36,559
You killed Rick because
he stole your queen.

463
00:30:37,227 --> 00:30:40,748
I couldn't have killed Rick.
I can't dive.

464
00:30:40,748 --> 00:30:43,032
So you had Chilly do it for you.

465
00:30:43,032 --> 00:30:46,671
But whoever killed Chilly
didn't need to dive.

466
00:30:46,671 --> 00:30:49,676
He just had to pull anchor.

467
00:30:49,925 --> 00:30:52,597
He died of the bends,
trying to save himself.

468
00:30:52,597 --> 00:30:57,306
Our ME told us it was an agonizing death.

469
00:30:57,930 --> 00:31:01,205
I could never do this to another diver.

470
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:05,461
Dana has an alibi.
She was on your boat.

471
00:31:05,461 --> 00:31:10,860
Every guy at the marina watched her
bronze herself on the deck.

472
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:13,695
Who's gonna vouch for you?

473
00:31:18,448 --> 00:31:22,646
Dana's gonna let me go down for this.

474
00:31:22,646 --> 00:31:27,298
God. I have done nothing
but help her out with you,

475
00:31:27,298 --> 00:31:30,354
with the Chilly... warehouse.

476
00:31:30,354 --> 00:31:32,715
That warehouse, did you help her...

477
00:31:32,715 --> 00:31:36,006
- Or did you just help yourself?
- What?

478
00:31:36,006 --> 00:31:37,937
No, I...

479
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:41,189
She told me where it was.
I never went there.

480
00:31:47,751 --> 00:31:51,375
This is what happens
when you can't let go of your ex.

481
00:31:51,375 --> 00:31:52,889
So much for Camelot.

482
00:31:52,889 --> 00:31:55,678
Dana had Chilly kill Rick.

483
00:31:55,678 --> 00:31:57,505
And then had Stipe kill Chilly.

484
00:31:57,505 --> 00:32:01,822
She takes the money,
and leaves Stipe holding the lift bag.

485
00:32:02,746 --> 00:32:05,614
Um, maybe.

486
00:32:08,029 --> 00:32:10,286
Uh, excuse me, counselor.

487
00:32:10,286 --> 00:32:16,900
Mr. Stipe, uh, a minute ago you told me
that you helped Dana with the warehouse.

488
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:19,036
What did you mean?

489
00:32:20,902 --> 00:32:24,513
Simon Harper called me... really upset.

490
00:32:24,513 --> 00:32:27,713
He knew Chilly and Dana
had taken some of the treasure.

491
00:32:27,713 --> 00:32:29,955
He wanted it back.

492
00:32:30,971 --> 00:32:34,589
So you were, um...

493
00:32:34,589 --> 00:32:37,328
So you played the middle man.

494
00:32:39,223 --> 00:32:41,337
Yeah.

495
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:47,252
And you told Harper
where the warehouse was.

496
00:32:53,473 --> 00:32:56,787
I never called Stipe.
I dealt exclusively with Rick.

497
00:32:56,787 --> 00:32:59,870
Until that other con artist came up to me.

498
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:02,921
Tom Stipe said he told you
where the coins were.

499
00:33:02,921 --> 00:33:04,888
And now they're gone.

500
00:33:05,115 --> 00:33:10,073
Sister, I manage hundreds of millions
of dollars through my family trust.

501
00:33:10,073 --> 00:33:13,022
I don't need a bunch of coins
to support my family.

502
00:33:13,022 --> 00:33:15,436
In fact, you don't need to work at all
to support your family.

503
00:33:15,436 --> 00:33:17,460
No, I don't.

504
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,937
Nor do I need to get caught up
in a murder investigation.

505
00:33:19,937 --> 00:33:23,034
Or two. We found Chilly's body
near Fire Island.

506
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:25,829
He'd been diving at the wreck site.

507
00:33:25,829 --> 00:33:29,001
No, that's wrong.
That's nowhere near my wreck site.

508
00:33:29,001 --> 00:33:31,772
All right, maybe Rick lied to you
to confuse you.

509
00:33:31,772 --> 00:33:35,321
He obviously lied to you
about what kind of ship it was.

510
00:33:35,321 --> 00:33:39,975
Revolutionary war ship wouldn't be
carrying coins from the 1860s.

511
00:33:39,975 --> 00:33:42,852
My point exactly.
Obviously, that's not my ship.

512
00:33:42,852 --> 00:33:45,128
Rick take you to the wreck site?

513
00:33:45,128 --> 00:33:49,708
No, I was waiting to hear back from him
about that day he disappeared.

514
00:33:50,781 --> 00:33:53,914
It's my wife.
She may be going into labor.

515
00:33:53,914 --> 00:33:56,904
Oh, okay.
Uh, we'll be in touch.

516
00:33:57,974 --> 00:34:01,399
Why would he hire treasure hunters
if he doesn't want the treasure?

517
00:34:01,399 --> 00:34:03,597
This isn't the first ship
he's tried to salvage.

518
00:34:03,597 --> 00:34:06,948
He hired Stipe two years ago
to find a wreck in Charleston.

519
00:34:06,948 --> 00:34:08,506
Now, that was a civil war wreck.

520
00:34:08,506 --> 00:34:11,401
Harper said that they never found it.

521
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,402
So find it.

522
00:34:23,094 --> 00:34:25,157
Any luck?

523
00:34:25,157 --> 00:34:30,184
Well, the Charleston boat
was called The Philomela.

524
00:34:30,184 --> 00:34:33,589
But I can't find its page
in the ship registry.

525
00:34:33,589 --> 00:34:36,466
It should be here somewhere.

526
00:34:46,939 --> 00:34:48,570
Look.

527
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:52,074
This shadow.
A page has been cut out.

528
00:34:52,074 --> 00:34:55,166
It's just cut really close to the spine.

529
00:34:55,166 --> 00:34:59,571
The only people allowed in here
are academics and historians.

530
00:35:06,377 --> 00:35:09,355
Well, I bet they let benefactors in.

531
00:35:14,065 --> 00:35:19,798
You were right. Simon Harper made
a $100,000 donation to the archives.

532
00:35:20,616 --> 00:35:22,517
The Philomela.

533
00:36:47,443 --> 00:36:48,904
Josiah.

534
00:36:48,904 --> 00:36:50,976
That rings a bell.

535
00:36:51,981 --> 00:36:56,698
Josiah Roundtree.
The Quaker turncoat.

536
00:36:56,698 --> 00:37:00,537
The roundtrees were a revered
New York Quaker family,

537
00:37:00,537 --> 00:37:03,232
till Josiah's greed got in the way.

538
00:37:03,232 --> 00:37:06,101
The furs and the horseshoes to Brazil,
that's just a cover.

539
00:37:06,101 --> 00:37:10,531
He was sending money to the south
to help keep slavery legal.

540
00:37:10,531 --> 00:37:15,300
So the coins in the boat
prove Josiah's guilt.

541
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:19,572
Is Harper so desperate to erase
his ancestor's shame,

542
00:37:19,572 --> 00:37:21,343
he'd murder two people?

543
00:37:21,343 --> 00:37:24,929
Well, can you imagine him
having to explain this to his wife?

544
00:37:24,929 --> 00:37:28,510
That's why Harper doesn't
want to bring the coins up.

545
00:37:28,772 --> 00:37:31,461
There's something on that ship that's...

546
00:37:31,461 --> 00:37:35,031
that will cost him more than it's worth.

547
00:37:38,763 --> 00:37:40,683
How's he doing with his new baby?

548
00:37:40,683 --> 00:37:45,288
That might have been another cover.
His wife never checked into a hospital.

549
00:37:47,958 --> 00:37:49,992
Okay, well, that's good.

550
00:37:49,992 --> 00:37:53,529
We have time to tell Harper
that we're raising The Philomela.

551
00:38:08,086 --> 00:38:09,592
Mr. Harper!

552
00:38:10,186 --> 00:38:11,832
Good news.

553
00:38:11,832 --> 00:38:15,337
I think we found your wreckage.
Philomela.

554
00:38:15,337 --> 00:38:18,073
I got Captain Fox,
part of our scuba unit,

555
00:38:18,073 --> 00:38:19,507
on the other end of this thing.

556
00:38:19,507 --> 00:38:23,752
He says as soon as they ID this wreck,
they can start recovery.

557
00:38:27,855 --> 00:38:30,322
That's not my ship.
Mine is The Falkirk.

558
00:38:30,322 --> 00:38:32,650
No, don't you remember?

559
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:36,628
The Philomela is the name of the boat
you looked for off Charleston.

560
00:38:36,628 --> 00:38:39,135
Turns out your divers found it here.

561
00:38:39,135 --> 00:38:40,764
It's yours.

562
00:38:40,764 --> 00:38:43,490
I don't want to pay for the recovery.
Leave it.

563
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:44,867
- Captain!
- What do you mean?

564
00:38:44,867 --> 00:38:47,359
There could be tens of millions of dollars
of gold coins on that thing.

565
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:49,505
- Captain.
- Why wouldn't you wanna claim that?

566
00:38:49,505 --> 00:38:50,577
Bring that boat back.

567
00:38:50,577 --> 00:38:52,033
I told you before,
I don't need the money.

568
00:38:52,033 --> 00:38:54,445
Ah, that's just the Quaker in you talking.

569
00:38:54,445 --> 00:38:56,966
My family hasn't been religious
for generations.

570
00:38:56,966 --> 00:38:58,769
Family? The Harpers?

571
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:02,903
Your father, grandfather?
Or the Roundtrees, as in Josiah?

572
00:39:03,227 --> 00:39:06,012
- We're all the same family.
- Oh, hardly.

573
00:39:06,012 --> 00:39:10,308
The Roundtrees have lived in disgrace,
while the harpers, well...

574
00:39:10,308 --> 00:39:14,416
they've prospered.
Especially you.

575
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:16,676
You're the only Harper of your generation.

576
00:39:16,676 --> 00:39:18,413
And the last.

577
00:39:18,413 --> 00:39:20,134
I want my son to have the Roundtree name.

578
00:39:20,134 --> 00:39:22,691
Well, that's why you hired Rick the first time.

579
00:39:22,691 --> 00:39:25,313
To prove there was no money
on the Philomela.

580
00:39:25,313 --> 00:39:29,240
To prove your great grandfather
Josiah wasn't a traitor.

581
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,894
Very good, detective.
You figured it out.

582
00:39:31,894 --> 00:39:35,035
If you raise those coins,
you'll reopen the family wound.

583
00:39:35,035 --> 00:39:36,175
Now get me out of here.

584
00:39:36,175 --> 00:39:38,509
No, we think there's more to it than that.

585
00:39:38,509 --> 00:39:42,161
You know, when Rick told you
they found that treasure,

586
00:39:42,161 --> 00:39:46,391
I guess you realized that that money
would prove that Josiah...

587
00:39:46,391 --> 00:39:49,344
Josiah defrauded his father.

588
00:39:49,344 --> 00:39:53,242
Josiah got wiped out
in the stock market in 1861.

589
00:39:53,242 --> 00:39:57,815
His father amended his will,
gave the land to him instead of his brother.

590
00:39:57,815 --> 00:39:59,259
But Josiah lied.

591
00:39:59,259 --> 00:40:02,787
He didn't lose that money,
he put it on The Philomela.

592
00:40:02,787 --> 00:40:04,290
What, you were there?

593
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:05,827
I didn't have to be.

594
00:40:05,827 --> 00:40:10,824
Wills are filed in surrogate court.
We found a handwritten codicil.

595
00:40:10,824 --> 00:40:17,017
Statute of Limitations on fraud doesn't run out
until three years after discovery.

596
00:40:17,988 --> 00:40:19,511
That boat comes up,

597
00:40:19,511 --> 00:40:23,262
the Roundtrees... they could be entitled
to your entire fortune.

598
00:40:23,262 --> 00:40:25,863
No wonder you panicked
when Rick called you.

599
00:40:25,863 --> 00:40:28,254
So you convinced Rick to take you
down to the wreck

600
00:40:28,254 --> 00:40:30,232
so you could see for yourself.

601
00:40:30,232 --> 00:40:33,837
And once you did, you were
prepared to get rid of him.

602
00:40:33,837 --> 00:40:34,951
You know, that was good work.

603
00:40:34,951 --> 00:40:38,728
Planting those photos on Rick's camera
and then on Chilly's computer.

604
00:40:38,728 --> 00:40:41,041
We found the transom,
it's The Philomela.

605
00:40:41,041 --> 00:40:42,722
Shall we start the recovery?

606
00:40:42,722 --> 00:40:44,664
Yeah, hand on a second.
Wait till my orders.

607
00:40:44,664 --> 00:40:47,804
What do you think, Mr. Harper,
you gonna tell us what happened?

608
00:40:48,692 --> 00:40:50,765
Or should we bring up
Josiah's blood money

609
00:40:50,765 --> 00:40:52,601
and prove that the Roundtrees
were defrauded?

610
00:40:52,601 --> 00:40:53,869
No.

611
00:40:54,398 --> 00:40:56,087
Don't.

612
00:40:57,510 --> 00:40:59,657
The family trust is my son's birthright.

613
00:40:59,657 --> 00:41:02,229
Yeah, if you erase history.
That's what you tried to do, right?

614
00:41:02,229 --> 00:41:03,550
With Rick.

615
00:41:03,731 --> 00:41:05,767
With Chilly.
Dana was next.

616
00:41:05,767 --> 00:41:08,766
These people are lowlifes.
Bums.

617
00:41:08,766 --> 00:41:11,513
Rick, he's been dead
to his family for years.

618
00:41:11,513 --> 00:41:12,981
And you think they chose that?

619
00:41:12,981 --> 00:41:15,644
A man with no parents, no kids.

620
00:41:15,644 --> 00:41:17,211
What is he?
Nothing.

621
00:41:17,211 --> 00:41:18,419
His life is wasted.

622
00:41:18,419 --> 00:41:21,683
Yeah, well, not everyone can get
these things that they want.

623
00:41:21,955 --> 00:41:24,634
To you, they're what,
just orphans, right?

624
00:41:24,634 --> 00:41:28,780
All unloved. You left them floating
like driftwood, right?

625
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:31,260
Is that why you got rid of them
the way that you did?

626
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:33,242
I was just protecting my family.

627
00:41:33,242 --> 00:41:35,074
Protecting your family?

628
00:41:35,074 --> 00:41:36,915
You should have seen
the greed in Rick's eyes.

629
00:41:36,915 --> 00:41:39,377
- And Chilly's.
- No one can protect their family.

630
00:41:39,377 --> 00:41:40,918
- Not even you.
- My wife and son deserve...

631
00:41:40,918 --> 00:41:43,560
Simon Harper, you are under arrest
for the murder of Tarek Agiza...

632
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,293
You won't take it from them.

633
00:41:50,879 --> 00:41:53,470
Fish him out and cuff him.

634
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:01,427
So... what happened?

635
00:42:01,427 --> 00:42:03,979
Harper slipped and fell.

636
00:42:04,979 --> 00:42:14,979
