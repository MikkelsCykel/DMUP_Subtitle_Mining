1
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:31,401
You stepped over the line.

2
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:38,784
- Huh?
- You stepped over the line, miss.

3
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,786
Uh, it's Ms.

4
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,790
Sorry, Ms., but, um-

5
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,542
I meant to.

6
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:49,545
You're not supposed to do that.
Or the photos.

7
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:52,881
- That's why I tried it.
- Why?

8
00:02:52,965 --> 00:02:54,883
To see what would happen.

9
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:56,635
Well, uh,

10
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:58,637
I mean,
I'm what happens.

11
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:02,933
I-I ha-- I have to walk over, like I've
done, and ask you to take a step back.

12
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:06,979
And if someone doesn't,
what then?

13
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:08,939
I'm not sure.

14
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:11,942
I've never had anyone
not step back.

15
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,903
I've only said it, like, four times,
and every time they've done it.

16
00:03:14,987 --> 00:03:18,365
What if I'm your first?
Non-stepper, I mean. Then what?

17
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:21,785
Look, I'm off in 10 minutes. I'd probably just
stand here, make sure you didn't touch anything.

18
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:23,620
Really?
Pretty much.

19
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:27,583
Yeah-- No, I'd let the next shift talk
to you, kick you out, or whatever.

20
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:30,127
You wouldn't grab me or anything?

21
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:36,592
You're not gonna mess up
my weekend with this, are you?

22
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:39,595
I wasn't planning on it, but I'm
not completely against it either.

23
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:43,098
See, if you get all crazy, then I gotta
write up a report and stuff.

24
00:03:43,182 --> 00:03:47,644
I'm here till 5:00, 5:30 easy, and I have
a second job to get to- the video store.

25
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:51,106
Oh, that's where I--

26
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:54,818
I've seen you in there.
you helped me once, I think.

27
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:57,154
Yeah? With what?

28
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,156
The Picture of Dorian Gray.

29
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,159
You found it in " Drama,"
not "Classics."

30
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,161
Right!
I remember that!

31
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,747
Somebody misplaced it. Yes!
Yeah, behind Cabaret.

32
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,749
Mmm.
That's funny.

33
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,627
Anyway, you helped me.
That was... nice.

34
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:15,088
Thanks.

35
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,799
But you're not gonna
return the favor, right?

36
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:19,801
You mean, step back over-

37
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:22,679
- No, I-I'm- I'm sorry. I can't.
- Why is that?

38
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:25,182
It's a pretty good-sized sculpture.

39
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,643
You could see it just fine from here.

40
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:30,896
Truthfully?
I'm gonna deface the statue.

41
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:33,565
Oh.
Uh, is that paint?

42
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,567
Yes, it is.
Great.

43
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:39,905
Hey, uh, paint's not really a great
thing to bring into a museum.

44
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:42,908
Why do you have that?

45
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:45,911
I'm gonna do something to the nude.
What, like, color it?

46
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:49,206
I'm thinking more of
painting a big dick on it.

47
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,084
And would "Why?" be completely
out of the question here?

48
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:55,337
- Because I don't like art that isn't true.
- True?

49
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,131
This sculpture, it's fake, it's not real.

50
00:04:58,215 --> 00:05:00,133
Therefore, false art.

51
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:02,135
No, it's a Fornicelli.

52
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:05,597
It definitely is.
I read the little thing there one time.

53
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,724
- Yes, but the leaf isn't.
- It's not?

54
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:11,186
Well, what is it? A paste or something,
like strippers have?

55
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:13,188
It's plaster...

56
00:05:13,272 --> 00:05:16,733
that was added by a committee who had
complaints from local townspeople.

57
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,735
Really?
I didn't know that.

58
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:22,239
They took issue with his thing-
you know, the shape of it.

59
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,491
Said it was too lifelike.

60
00:05:24,575 --> 00:05:27,828
It's supposed to be God. You know,
that's what pisses them off.

61
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:29,830
Look.

62
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:32,291
See, it's right behind
the leaf there.

63
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,960
You can just see his-

64
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:40,757
Yeah, but they didn't even cover it properly.
It's shoddy craftsmanship.

65
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:44,178
I mean, if you're gonna do it, at least do it--
Exactly. Do it right.

66
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:52,728
So, you're a student, then,
or is this just basic anarchy?

67
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:54,730
Student.
Me too.

68
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:58,233
What's your emphasis?
Taking out school loans, mostly.

69
00:05:58,317 --> 00:06:01,320
But I do sit in on
a few English classes.

70
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,406
You're in art?
Mm-hmm. MFA.

71
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,408
Oh.
Applied Theory and Crit.

72
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,410
So, is this, like, a project,
then, or--

73
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:11,413
No, I am just getting started
on my thesis project now.

74
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:15,083
It's a big sort of
installation... thing.

75
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:17,544
That's a good word, huh?
"Thing."

76
00:06:17,628 --> 00:06:19,546
It is.

77
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:24,801
Anyway, this is just...
an idea I had.

78
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:31,099
You're cute.

79
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,187
I don't like your hair.

80
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,231
Thanks... I think.

81
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:40,234
No, you're definitely cute,
but you should-

82
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:42,736
You should do something
with it, your hair.

83
00:06:42,778 --> 00:06:45,113
Okay.
I-I'll try that.

84
00:06:48,534 --> 00:06:50,869
Your relief's late.
Yeah. Typical.

85
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:55,332
Yeah, so do you have to stay
at your station until they spell you, or-

86
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:58,335
Oh, no, no. At punch-out time I'm
supposed to get down there and do it.

87
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,337
They can really be pricks
about that.

88
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,381
Oh, you should go, then.

89
00:07:03,966 --> 00:07:05,968
Yeah.

90
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:20,691
Can I call you?

91
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:26,196
What do you want to call me?

92
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,949
Um...just up...

93
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:30,909
for right now.

94
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:34,413
I mean, talk.
Maybe get crazy.

95
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,456
Um, take you to dinner?

96
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,543
Okay.

97
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:41,545
Uh, sure.

98
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:44,548
Do they... allow you
to do that here?

99
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,884
What, eat dinner?

100
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:49,636
I meant, hit on the patrons.
Uh, no.

101
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,639
They've got a pretty strict policy
about that too actually.

102
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:55,100
But--
Ah. The great equalizer.

103
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:57,269
" But."
Exactly.

104
00:07:57,311 --> 00:08:01,273
I'll take the risk.
Good answer, Grasshopper.

105
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:03,192
What?

106
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:05,194
Kung Fu. On TV?

107
00:08:05,277 --> 00:08:09,406
Remember when he was a kid, there was
an old guy with fake contact lenses-

108
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,408
Right!

109
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,744
Grasshopper.

110
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:16,747
I don't really watch
much television.

111
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,790
Yeah.

112
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,756
So, do you want
a number?

113
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,175
Hmm? Oh, God.
Absolutely.

114
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:31,803
Oh, dang it.
I don't have a pen.

115
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:33,847
Me either.

116
00:08:34,932 --> 00:08:36,808
Here.
What?

117
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,810
Give me the jacket.

118
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:40,854
Hmm? Oh.

119
00:08:45,943 --> 00:08:47,861
Uh-- Uh--
That's my own.

120
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:50,948
That's not part of the uniform.
That's mine.

121
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:56,036
Good. Now you'll
always have it on you.

122
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:59,039
3-3-0--

123
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:01,124
Great.

124
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,629
Yeah.

125
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:08,632
- So, I'll call you?
- Yeah.

126
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:11,260
It was nice
to meet you... again.

127
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:13,345
You too.

128
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:49,173
You can definitely tell.
you can.

129
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:52,676
- Really.
- I bet your friends say something.

130
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:55,137
Twenty bucks.

131
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,639
Okay.

132
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:03,103
- I mean, I can't tell, so I figured-
- That's because you see you every day,
shower, getting dressed-

133
00:10:03,187 --> 00:10:06,190
- So do you.
- I don't see you shower or getting dressed.

134
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:09,359
I meant everyday.
So far, anyways.

135
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:11,361
I know. I'm kidding.
Oh.

136
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,102
I'd like that, though,

137
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:46,772
if... you would.

138
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:48,774
What?

139
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:52,611
Showering and...
getting dressed, you know-

140
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:55,614
Both, if you want.

141
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:58,617
Either. Anything.
Any moment I can get with you.

142
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:00,619
That's what I'd like.

143
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:02,663
Ask and you shall receive.

144
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:08,627
So I'm asking, then.

145
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:11,004
So you shall be
receiving, then.

146
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:30,482
PDA.
What?

147
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,569
Public display of affection.
Oh.

148
00:11:33,652 --> 00:11:35,571
I'm not used to that.
No?

149
00:11:35,654 --> 00:11:37,573
I don't mind.
Really?

150
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:40,576
Nah. Whose business is it?
Ours, right?

151
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:44,079
Kiss if we want to. Make love
in a bathroom stall. Who cares?

152
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:46,915
I'd start with
the administration.

153
00:11:46,999 --> 00:11:50,919
Why should they? We're two adults.
We know what we're doing.

154
00:11:51,003 --> 00:11:54,423
I think this is a bigger discussion
than before Jenny and Philip get here.

155
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:56,425
Whatever.
Oh, no, I mean--

156
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:59,428
I'd love to have it with you-
uh, the discussion.

157
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:01,763
And I agree... somewhat.
I understand.

158
00:12:01,847 --> 00:12:03,932
No, another time
we'll definitely discuss it.

159
00:12:04,016 --> 00:12:06,435
"Another time."

160
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:08,437
I'd rather do it.

161
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:13,525
We'll, let me go
check the men's room.

162
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:18,447
You amaze me.

163
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,782
And you amaze me.

164
00:12:20,866 --> 00:12:23,118
You do. Look at you.

165
00:12:23,202 --> 00:12:25,078
It's just a little jogging.

166
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:27,080
I'm very proud of you.

167
00:12:27,164 --> 00:12:29,082
Thank you...

168
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,585
Henry Higgins.

169
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:34,880
What's that?
That's from a book.

170
00:12:34,922 --> 00:12:36,882
Well, it's a play actually.

171
00:12:36,924 --> 00:12:39,218
Not the one we're seeing,
though, is it?

172
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:42,387
No, we're... seeing Medea.
Oh, yeah, right.

173
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:44,973
I read this as an undergrad.
I like it.

174
00:12:45,057 --> 00:12:48,602
- Should I be nervous?
- No, not too much.

175
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:50,729
I mean, unless we have kids.

176
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:55,108
Now, what about you?

177
00:12:55,192 --> 00:12:57,444
What about me?

178
00:12:57,528 --> 00:13:00,322
- I don't know anything about you.
- Yes, you do.

179
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:02,282
I don't. Not really.

180
00:13:02,366 --> 00:13:06,078
- Where am I from?
- Illinois, near Chicago.

181
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:09,748
- Sign.
- Gemini, I think.

182
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:13,377
- The twins, yes.
- Does that mean that you have a split personality?

183
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,171
- No, it means I was born in June.
- Ah. Okay.

184
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:19,591
Anything else you wanna know?

185
00:13:20,592 --> 00:13:22,678
Why do you like me?

186
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:25,347
- What?
- Why would you like me?

187
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,349
I'm not anything. I mean-

188
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:31,311
Don't do that, okay? That's the
only thing about you I don't like.

189
00:13:31,353 --> 00:13:34,857
What you see in yourself
or don't see.

190
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:38,819
Fuckin' insecurities.

191
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,085
Sorry.

192
00:13:55,169 --> 00:13:57,087
Do you like me?
Of course.

193
00:13:57,171 --> 00:14:00,090
- And do I appear to like you? Huh?
- Yeah.

194
00:14:00,174 --> 00:14:03,760
I mean, it seems like it, yes.
I do like you.

195
00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:06,763
Do I seem to know my own mind?
No question.

196
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:10,267
So don't you trust me, then, to know how I feel?
Yeah- No, you're right-

197
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,769
I mean,
don't worry about "why..."

198
00:14:12,853 --> 00:14:17,316
when... "what"
is right in front of you.

199
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:20,319
Those are very wise words...

200
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:24,198
from someone
with such a great ass.

201
00:14:27,201 --> 00:14:29,161
Kiss me...

202
00:14:30,621 --> 00:14:33,790
Grasshopper.

203
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:43,884
Ah-ah-ah!

204
00:14:43,926 --> 00:14:45,886
PDA.

205
00:14:45,928 --> 00:14:48,889
I don't think anybody wants
to watch you kiss, Adam.

206
00:14:50,933 --> 00:14:52,893
Hi, guys.

207
00:14:52,935 --> 00:14:54,686
- Hey, Phil.
- Hello.

208
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:56,730
Hi.
Hey!

209
00:14:57,856 --> 00:14:59,775
Evelyn, this is Philip.

210
00:14:59,858 --> 00:15:01,777
- Hello.
- Hi.

211
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,779
And his fiancee, Jenny.

212
00:15:03,862 --> 00:15:05,781
- Hi.
- Hey.

213
00:15:05,864 --> 00:15:07,783
So, should we grab our tickets?

214
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:09,785
Adam, what's up with you?

215
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:11,787
Did you lose weight?

216
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:14,289
Um... a little, maybe.

217
00:15:14,373 --> 00:15:17,125
No, it's--
He cut his hair or something.

218
00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:19,628
- That's it, right?
- Right.

219
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:22,130
Yeah, well, uh, both, sort of.

220
00:15:22,214 --> 00:15:24,132
Huh.

221
00:15:24,216 --> 00:15:26,510
Okay, so, let's, uh-
Come on.

222
00:15:31,265 --> 00:15:33,267
Oh.

223
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,066
Come on.

224
00:16:07,926 --> 00:16:10,846
- So tell me this again. You guys are gonna-
- Underwater.

225
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:12,848
We're gonna get married underwater.

226
00:16:12,931 --> 00:16:17,144
You gotta be kidding me. Like in those
Life magazine photos you see, or whatever.

227
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:19,354
Is that, like,
a... California thing?

228
00:16:19,438 --> 00:16:22,357
No. We wanted to try something bold.

229
00:16:22,441 --> 00:16:24,860
That oughta do it.
That is crazy. Really.

230
00:16:24,943 --> 00:16:27,863
So if we want to attend,
we have to--

231
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:30,032
Get in the tank with us.
you bet.

232
00:16:30,115 --> 00:16:32,201
- No. Honey, I thought we said the guests-
- U h, we haven't--

233
00:16:32,284 --> 00:16:35,787
We haven't settled
that part completely.

234
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:39,333
- That is nuts.
- No, I applaud you. I think it is very bold.

235
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:42,336
Yeah, well, don't expect my buddy
here to follow in our footsteps.

236
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:44,671
- He's the least adventurous
person I know. - Really?

237
00:16:44,755 --> 00:16:47,508
Absolutely.
Oh, and the marriage thing?

238
00:16:47,591 --> 00:16:50,427
Uh-uh.
It's not gonna happen. Sorry.

239
00:16:50,511 --> 00:16:53,430
I don't know how many nights
I listened to this guy say,

240
00:16:53,514 --> 00:16:56,725
" Not me, man. I'm never
gettin' hooked. No way, man."

241
00:16:56,808 --> 00:16:59,394
Well, well!
Listen, don't encourage him.

242
00:16:59,478 --> 00:17:02,481
My room doesn't need
any more encouragement.

243
00:17:02,523 --> 00:17:04,441
Former roommate.

244
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:09,947
You're gonna look stupid
in one of it hose wet suits.

245
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:13,242
Hey, let's not be
a party pooper, my friend.

246
00:17:13,325 --> 00:17:15,285
This could have been yours.

247
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:18,247
Oh, Phil, stop being-

248
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:26,296
Adam and I had a class together, and he
never got up the nerve to ask me out.

249
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:30,092
I'm borrowing his pen, like, all the time--
hint, hint--

250
00:17:30,175 --> 00:17:32,886
and he's this total monk
the whole semester.

251
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:37,516
Anyway, Phil picks him up
from class one day, sees me,

252
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:40,686
and we went to mini golf
that same night.

253
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:43,689
I cannot tell a lie.
I got the moves, God help me.

254
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:46,316
Whoo!
God help all of us.

255
00:17:46,692 --> 00:17:49,319
Well, like I said,
I think it's great.

256
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:51,989
It's really amazing- it is-

257
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:55,993
to find anybody willing
to take a risk these days,

258
00:17:56,076 --> 00:18:00,497
to look a little silly
or different or anything.

259
00:18:00,581 --> 00:18:03,834
Bravo.
To people with balls.

260
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:06,420
To balls.
Long may they wave.

261
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:12,217
I'll tell you
what took some balls.

262
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:16,221
That museum thing a few
weeks back, with the balls.

263
00:18:16,263 --> 00:18:18,223
Did you guys
read about that?

264
00:18:18,265 --> 00:18:21,476
Oh, Adam, of course you did.
you were supposed to be guarding it.

265
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:25,230
But, uh--
Evelyn, did you hear about it?

266
00:18:25,314 --> 00:18:28,108
- The penis.
- Yes, I did.

267
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:30,027
Why are we whispering?

268
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:32,779
Because you don't say "penis"
in Jenny's house.

269
00:18:32,863 --> 00:18:37,743
But we're at my place now,
so we sing it from the eaves.

270
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:39,870
# Penis, penis #

271
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:41,872
Bar's closed.
Last call.

272
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:44,625
- # Penis, penis #
- Nice.

273
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:47,127
Seriously, though,
can you believe that shit?

274
00:18:47,211 --> 00:18:51,507
Somebody with the gall to pull that kind
of bullshit on our campus? Fuckin' burns me up.

275
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:53,634
Shh.
I'm an artist, so...

276
00:18:53,717 --> 00:18:55,719
Maybe we should-
I don't really have the same reaction as--

277
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:59,973
I mean, this isn't Berkeley. What does
that mean anyway- " I'm an artist"?

278
00:19:00,057 --> 00:19:01,975
Mmm, nothing.

279
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:04,228
It means nothing really.

280
00:19:04,311 --> 00:19:06,813
Just that
I understand the impulse.

281
00:19:06,897 --> 00:19:09,233
You what?
Um, Evelyn, we should probably-

282
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:11,735
No, no. Wait, Adam.
I wanna hear.

283
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:15,113
What impulse?
It's called vandalism.

284
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:17,366
Uh, does anybody want dessert?
Holdon.

285
00:19:17,449 --> 00:19:19,868
This is rich. Go ahead.

286
00:19:19,952 --> 00:19:23,872
Just that, um, I don't think
it was just kids playing.

287
00:19:23,956 --> 00:19:27,125
I think it was
a sort of statement, a kind of--

288
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:29,419
- Statement?
- Yeah, I do.

289
00:19:29,503 --> 00:19:32,464
What kind of statement would that be?
It was pornography.

290
00:19:32,506 --> 00:19:34,800
- Oh, no, it wasn't.
- Yes, it was.

291
00:19:34,842 --> 00:19:37,302
No. Pornography is meant
to titillate, to excite you.

292
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:40,639
- Did you see a picture of what happened?
- We did, yeah.

293
00:19:40,681 --> 00:19:42,641
And does a penis excite you?

294
00:19:42,683 --> 00:19:45,102
I mean, just any old penis?

295
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:47,271
Uh, you're funny,
and that's not the point.

296
00:19:47,354 --> 00:19:49,273
It's totally the point!

297
00:19:49,356 --> 00:19:53,694
How about you, Jenn? Did you like
what you saw? Did it get you hot?

298
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:55,863
This is, like,
uncalled for, okay?

299
00:19:55,946 --> 00:19:58,907
- All she said was--
- I know what she said. Why don't you let her speak?

300
00:20:01,535 --> 00:20:04,496
Did you wanna say
anything else? Huh?

301
00:20:15,716 --> 00:20:18,135
Okay.

302
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:21,680
Then, look, all I'm--
I'm saying is that, in my opinion,

303
00:20:21,722 --> 00:20:25,017
it wasn't pornography,
it was a statement.

304
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:27,477
Wow.
The postgraduate mind at work.

305
00:20:27,561 --> 00:20:30,564
You know, I still don't see
how that makes it a statement.

306
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:33,066
- What do you mean?
- It's graffiti.

307
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:36,904
It would be a huge statement,
especially for a town like this.

308
00:20:36,987 --> 00:20:40,365
Which "Take Back the Night" rally
did you find her at, Adam?

309
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:43,577
You're really the obnoxious type.
You know that?

310
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:47,080
- I mean, how long did you have
to stomach this guy? - Evelyn-

311
00:20:47,164 --> 00:20:50,542
Anyhow, who knows what the person
was saying by it. We don't.

312
00:20:50,584 --> 00:20:55,297
But I think it was a gesture,
a kind of manifesto, if you will-

313
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:59,426
W-W-Wait. I don't think a person's
dick can be a manifesto. Uh-uh.

314
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:02,262
You can write a manifesto
on your thing,

315
00:21:02,346 --> 00:21:04,348
but your thing can't be one.

316
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:09,394
I'm sure I read that somewhere.
See, you're just trying to be really-

317
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:12,272
Hey, I'm not trying to be anything.
Who the hell do you think you are?

318
00:21:12,356 --> 00:21:15,651
A few double dates, and telling me
anything about who I am.

319
00:21:15,734 --> 00:21:19,154
- Un-fucking-believable!
- Okay, this is getting a little-

320
00:21:19,238 --> 00:21:22,282
Adam, you can really pick 'em.
Let's just forget the whole-

321
00:21:22,366 --> 00:21:25,911
- You are not gonna take his side in this, are you?
- No.

322
00:21:25,953 --> 00:21:28,914
Jesus! I'm just trying to get out of here
with a touch of dignity.

323
00:21:28,956 --> 00:21:30,832
I've got a test tomorrow anyway.
"Statement."

324
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:32,918
Just shut the fuck up!

325
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,049
Fuck right off.

326
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:41,051
How would you know?

327
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:44,680
I think she was making one.
So, that's my opinion.

328
00:21:49,643 --> 00:21:51,603
Jenny,
thanks for everything.

329
00:21:51,645 --> 00:21:54,940
Yeah, how'd you know
it was a girl?

330
00:21:54,982 --> 00:21:57,442
I don't.
I just said.

331
00:21:57,484 --> 00:22:00,445
It's a guess-
what it was, where it was placed.

332
00:22:00,487 --> 00:22:02,447
An educated guess.

333
00:22:02,489 --> 00:22:04,449
Oh, you're not-

334
00:22:04,491 --> 00:22:07,452
She's not trying to take a poke
at my being an undergrad, is she?

335
00:22:07,494 --> 00:22:10,455
Okay, can we just stop this now, please?
Adam, tell me she didn't just-

336
00:22:10,497 --> 00:22:14,126
Hey, artiste, how did you know it was
a woman who painted the cock?

337
00:22:14,168 --> 00:22:16,128
Very, very suspicious there.

338
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:18,964
You're such a prick.

339
00:22:19,006 --> 00:22:22,467
Man, how do you go on
day after day?

340
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:24,511
Let's go.

341
00:22:27,181 --> 00:22:29,141
Adam,
are you coming?

342
00:22:29,183 --> 00:22:31,059
Yeah.

343
00:22:31,143 --> 00:22:35,063
I'll meet you out front?
I just wanna-
Okay.

344
00:22:35,147 --> 00:22:37,065
You're very sweet.

345
00:22:37,149 --> 00:22:39,067
Good luck.

346
00:22:39,151 --> 00:22:42,070
"Good luck"?
Hey, fuck you!

347
00:22:42,154 --> 00:22:44,072
Oh, come on, m-man!

348
00:22:44,156 --> 00:22:47,409
Where in hell did you meet that bitch?
At the museum.

349
00:22:47,492 --> 00:22:50,579
What, did she give you a haircut
and a blowjob, now you're her puppy?

350
00:22:50,662 --> 00:22:52,664
Phil!
I'm not her puppy!

351
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:56,251
The wedding sounds great.

352
00:22:56,335 --> 00:22:59,254
Really, it sounds- Yeah.

353
00:22:59,338 --> 00:23:01,340
You don't have to leave.

354
00:24:22,838 --> 00:24:24,923
Were you...

355
00:24:25,007 --> 00:24:26,967
always like this before?

356
00:24:27,009 --> 00:24:29,303
So...

357
00:24:29,344 --> 00:24:31,221
You know.

358
00:24:31,305 --> 00:24:33,724
Shy?
Mm-hmm.

359
00:24:33,807 --> 00:24:36,727
Just about the fact that no one
would ever sleep with me. That's all.

360
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:38,729
Come on!
No, seriously.

361
00:24:38,812 --> 00:24:41,732
I mean, you're, like,
I don't know,

362
00:24:41,815 --> 00:24:43,734
only the third person
I've ever--

363
00:24:43,817 --> 00:24:45,736
Really?
Yeah.

364
00:24:45,819 --> 00:24:47,738
I mean it.

365
00:24:47,821 --> 00:24:49,781
And they were both young.

366
00:24:51,325 --> 00:24:53,744
I mean, I was too.

367
00:24:53,827 --> 00:24:57,080
I wasn't, like, hanging out
by a day care or anything.

368
00:24:57,164 --> 00:24:59,583
It was during high school, mostly.

369
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:02,586
So you're sort of
in uncharted waters here.

370
00:25:02,669 --> 00:25:06,256
I don't wanna
blow your cover, but...

371
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:09,593
I could kinda tell.

372
00:25:09,676 --> 00:25:11,595
Yeah?

373
00:25:11,678 --> 00:25:13,597
Yeah.

374
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,600
Well, that's okay.
Nobody here at school?

375
00:25:16,683 --> 00:25:18,602
Well, nothing serious.

376
00:25:18,685 --> 00:25:20,604
Dates.
Some close calls.

377
00:25:20,687 --> 00:25:22,606
But not anyone,
you know-

378
00:25:22,689 --> 00:25:25,609
Like Jenny?
No, no.

379
00:25:25,692 --> 00:25:28,612
Are you sorry
you didn't ask her out?

380
00:25:28,695 --> 00:25:31,031
Hmm? I mean, if--

381
00:25:31,114 --> 00:25:33,283
if I wasn't in the equation.

382
00:25:38,288 --> 00:25:40,207
Not really.

383
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:42,292
Hmm.

384
00:25:43,293 --> 00:25:45,879
We just never got the right-

385
00:25:45,963 --> 00:25:47,881
What--

386
00:25:47,965 --> 00:25:51,218
I sort of blew that one.

387
00:25:51,301 --> 00:25:53,887
Anyway, it's kinda weird
talking about it now that-

388
00:25:53,971 --> 00:25:55,889
That's okay.

389
00:25:55,973 --> 00:26:00,853
You know, it's nice to see,
every so often, someone... gallant.

390
00:26:00,894 --> 00:26:03,897
So, did you enjoy tonight?

391
00:26:04,982 --> 00:26:06,900
Uh-huh.

392
00:26:06,984 --> 00:26:08,902
Dinner was great.

393
00:26:08,986 --> 00:26:11,905
The trip into the city-
that was fun. I like your car.

394
00:26:11,989 --> 00:26:14,241
I meant the performance.

395
00:26:14,324 --> 00:26:16,243
Oh, right, that.

396
00:26:16,326 --> 00:26:18,328
Um--

397
00:26:19,997 --> 00:26:21,999
Not really.

398
00:26:24,835 --> 00:26:26,837
Well...

399
00:26:28,005 --> 00:26:29,923
that's all right.

400
00:26:30,007 --> 00:26:33,594
- That's fine.
- Oh, no, it's not that I didn't enjoy it. It was okay.

401
00:26:33,677 --> 00:26:35,387
You didn't think it was amazing?

402
00:26:35,429 --> 00:26:38,849
I thought it was amazing that the cops
didn't bust in and stop her.

403
00:26:38,932 --> 00:26:40,726
Oh, come on!

404
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:43,729
- How could you not find that moving,
what she was doing? - Easy.

405
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:46,732
I mean, granted, I usually love it when
a woman removes her tampon in front of me.

406
00:26:46,773 --> 00:26:50,194
- Very sexy.
- It's not supposed to be sexy.

407
00:26:50,277 --> 00:26:52,696
I was joking. You know that.

408
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:56,742
I mean, Jesus, it's an expression
of herself as an artist, as a woman,

409
00:26:56,783 --> 00:26:58,493
a person.

410
00:26:58,577 --> 00:27:01,747
I couldn't believe what I was seeing.

411
00:27:01,788 --> 00:27:03,957
Me either. You didn't get it.
That's all.

412
00:27:04,041 --> 00:27:08,003
No, that's not true.
We just don't agree. That's all.

413
00:27:08,086 --> 00:27:10,506
- I wanted to like it.
- Then why didn't you?

414
00:27:10,589 --> 00:27:13,467
Maybe because she was finger painting
portraits of her daddy using menstrual blood.

415
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:16,303
She... is completely influential,

416
00:27:16,386 --> 00:27:18,305
totally vanguard.

417
00:27:18,388 --> 00:27:23,644
To me, it was nasty, it was private, and I felt like
it was something I wasn't supposed to be seeing.

418
00:27:23,727 --> 00:27:26,104
She allowed you to though.

419
00:27:26,146 --> 00:27:30,275
She allowed you into her world,
into her work,

420
00:27:30,317 --> 00:27:32,361
but in a highly theatrical way.

421
00:27:32,444 --> 00:27:34,821
Exactly my point.
It's called theater, not therapy.

422
00:27:34,905 --> 00:27:36,782
No, it's called performance art!

423
00:27:36,823 --> 00:27:40,327
- It's called her period!
- It's called your taste up your ass!

424
00:28:17,656 --> 00:28:20,075
Did we just have our first fight?

425
00:28:22,995 --> 00:28:24,997
I think so.

426
00:28:30,002 --> 00:28:32,129
Yeah, we did.

427
00:28:33,297 --> 00:28:35,299
Cool.

428
00:28:36,341 --> 00:28:38,844
Better mark it down in our diaries.

429
00:28:42,264 --> 00:28:44,975
- Yeah.
- Hey.

430
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:48,979
We can do that- fight.
That's good.

431
00:28:50,063 --> 00:28:52,816
- Why good?
- 'Cause, um,

432
00:29:06,955 --> 00:29:09,291
now we get to make up.

433
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,982
Were you nervous before?

434
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:37,361
I mean, about us with the video.

435
00:29:38,654 --> 00:29:40,656
Oh, not really.

436
00:29:43,325 --> 00:29:45,285
- A bit.
- Sure.

437
00:29:45,327 --> 00:29:48,288
Yeah. It's just, let's not watch it. Okay?
Do we have to do that?

438
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:50,624
- Not if you don't want to.
- Good.

439
00:29:50,666 --> 00:29:54,253
'Cause I don't think I could get into
that actually. See, I'm totally different.

440
00:29:54,336 --> 00:29:57,297
I think everyone should
see themselves doing it,

441
00:29:57,339 --> 00:29:59,299
and their friends
should see it too.

442
00:29:59,341 --> 00:30:02,928
That's why the tape's going back to my place.
Don't be so frightened of everything.

443
00:30:03,011 --> 00:30:05,305
I'm not.
I'm not frightened anyway.

444
00:30:05,347 --> 00:30:08,934
I just don't think that's a thing other
people need to see, ever- my ass.

445
00:30:09,017 --> 00:30:12,604
People like who? Philip?

446
00:30:12,688 --> 00:30:14,982
No, that's fine.
you can show him.

447
00:30:15,023 --> 00:30:16,984
Are you crazy?

448
00:30:17,025 --> 00:30:20,320
Why is he your friend?
Oh, God, you don't wanna go over all that.

449
00:30:20,362 --> 00:30:23,323
I just don't think you need
that kind of person in your life.

450
00:30:23,365 --> 00:30:25,325
I mean, no one does.

451
00:30:25,367 --> 00:30:28,954
It- It may be a touch early to start
dictating who my friends are.

452
00:30:29,037 --> 00:30:32,416
Yeah... I suppose.

453
00:30:34,501 --> 00:30:37,421
Boy, he really got under
your skin, didn't he?

454
00:30:37,504 --> 00:30:40,924
Under, over, around.
I hate that kind of guy.

455
00:30:41,008 --> 00:30:42,926
What kind?
That kind.

456
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:45,929
Whatever he is, that's what I hate.
I'll let him know.

457
00:30:46,013 --> 00:30:49,933
No! God, no.
Don't give him the satisfaction.

458
00:30:50,017 --> 00:30:53,437
And he'd take it too. Believe me.
I don't know.

459
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,440
Maybe it would help him,
you know, be better or something.

460
00:30:56,523 --> 00:30:59,985
The only thing that would help him
is a fuckin' knife through his throat.

461
00:31:04,031 --> 00:31:06,950
Okay, I'm glad I don't have
a pet rabbit or anything.

462
00:31:07,034 --> 00:31:08,952
You know what I mean.

463
00:31:09,036 --> 00:31:10,954
Um... no, not really.

464
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:14,958
I've just been around his type,
that's all, and I don't like him.

465
00:31:15,042 --> 00:31:16,960
Yeah, I got that part.
No big deal.

466
00:31:17,044 --> 00:31:22,299
Right. No, it was the "knife through the throat"
part that was the big deal, I thought.

467
00:31:22,382 --> 00:31:24,635
Oh, that's just an expression.

468
00:31:24,718 --> 00:31:26,637
From where?
Transylvania?

469
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,639
No.

470
00:31:28,722 --> 00:31:31,558
From the Scorned Girl's Handbook.

471
00:31:31,642 --> 00:31:33,560
Oh, yeah, page 333.

472
00:31:33,644 --> 00:31:36,230
You've been peeking.

473
00:31:36,313 --> 00:31:39,233
You know what happens
to peekers, don't you?

474
00:31:39,316 --> 00:31:42,736
Well, if they're deejays, they usually get asked
to play " Misty" on the radio all the time.

475
00:31:42,819 --> 00:31:46,573
Close.
No, I'll show you.

476
00:31:46,657 --> 00:31:49,576
But you have to do me a favor.
What's that?

477
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:52,371
Just... smile.

478
00:31:53,372 --> 00:31:56,375
Smile into the camera...

479
00:32:00,671 --> 00:32:03,257
for as...

480
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:05,342
long as you can.

481
00:32:45,966 --> 00:32:47,926
Jenny!

482
00:32:47,968 --> 00:32:49,970
Adam! Hi!

483
00:32:52,556 --> 00:32:54,558
Hey.

484
00:33:00,147 --> 00:33:02,149
Hi.

485
00:33:03,317 --> 00:33:05,277
Oh!
So--

486
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:07,988
Thanks for coming.
I appreciate it.

487
00:33:09,114 --> 00:33:11,533
Of course.
How's it going?

488
00:33:11,617 --> 00:33:13,869
You know... okay.

489
00:33:13,952 --> 00:33:15,954
Right.

490
00:33:26,173 --> 00:33:28,300
Lots to do for a wedding.
I bet.

491
00:33:28,383 --> 00:33:31,762
Yeah. Invitations to get out,
arrangements to make.

492
00:33:31,845 --> 00:33:34,431
Air tanks to fill.
That too.

493
00:33:34,515 --> 00:33:38,685
So you guys are still
going through with that, huh?
That's what we're saying.

494
00:33:38,769 --> 00:33:41,146
- What do you mean, "saying"?
- No, no, no. We are.

495
00:33:41,188 --> 00:33:43,649
It's what we're doing.
I just-

496
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:46,068
-Jenny, what?
- I don't know.

497
00:33:46,151 --> 00:33:48,946
- I'm just, you know, worried.
- Why?

498
00:33:49,029 --> 00:33:51,490
About what?
What do you think? Philip.

499
00:33:51,532 --> 00:33:53,742
He's just, I don't know, being funny.

500
00:33:53,825 --> 00:33:56,912
- Funny how?
-Just kinda funny odd.

501
00:33:56,995 --> 00:33:58,914
Like nice.

502
00:33:58,997 --> 00:34:00,916
- Nice?
- Yeah. You know, sweet?

503
00:34:00,999 --> 00:34:03,919
Now, I love him and all.
I do. You know that.

504
00:34:04,002 --> 00:34:07,631
But that is not the way I would describe him
to people- sweet. Would you?

505
00:34:07,714 --> 00:34:11,927
I wouldn't exactly use his name
and "sweet" in the same...

506
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:13,929
short story.

507
00:34:14,012 --> 00:34:15,931
And that's
what's bugging me.

508
00:34:16,014 --> 00:34:19,101
I mean, he's only been like this
once before, maybe twice.

509
00:34:19,184 --> 00:34:23,438
But definitely once, when we were first
going out and he was seeing somebody else.

510
00:34:23,522 --> 00:34:26,859
- You remember that?
- Yeah. I do. The other one.

511
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:29,403
The other Jenny. Exactly.

512
00:34:29,444 --> 00:34:31,822
I'd call and I could hear him
freeze up, you know,

513
00:34:31,905 --> 00:34:34,783
get all sort of... sweet,

514
00:34:34,867 --> 00:34:39,580
fish around slowly until he
figured out if it was her or me.

515
00:34:39,663 --> 00:34:41,874
God, I used to hate that.

516
00:34:43,876 --> 00:34:46,128
Maybe I'm just
making it all up, you know?

517
00:34:46,211 --> 00:34:51,508
I mean, my own insecurities
and looking for a reason to not-

518
00:34:51,592 --> 00:34:53,510
Dive in?

519
00:34:53,594 --> 00:34:56,722
- Take the plunge?
- Oh, God!

520
00:34:56,763 --> 00:34:59,224
Jump off the deep end?
Stop me before I-

521
00:34:59,266 --> 00:35:02,311
Cute, but yes.

522
00:35:02,394 --> 00:35:06,190
That might be it,
but I don't think so.

523
00:35:06,273 --> 00:35:08,901
I mean, I wanna get married.
I do.

524
00:35:08,984 --> 00:35:11,278
Even if it is underwater.

525
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:14,281
And I love the guy,
whether he's sweet or not.

526
00:35:14,323 --> 00:35:18,243
It's just, I don't believe him
now that he is.

527
00:35:19,995 --> 00:35:21,955
Well, you got me.

528
00:35:21,997 --> 00:35:25,584
Really? I mean, you don't know anything?
Haven't felt that?

529
00:35:25,667 --> 00:35:30,547
I only see him, like, once a week in our survey
course, so it's not like I'm in the inner circle anymore.

530
00:35:30,631 --> 00:35:34,051
I know. I just thought that maybe you'd
tell me if you knew something.

531
00:35:34,134 --> 00:35:37,054
But I would tell you, Jenny.
I would. Seriously.

532
00:35:37,137 --> 00:35:40,057
Really?
I think so.

533
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:44,228
I mean-- Oh, look, that's a lousy thing
to pass on to a person.

534
00:35:44,311 --> 00:35:47,564
And if I did, you know, know something
and then told you,

535
00:35:47,648 --> 00:35:50,567
You'd more likely hate me forever
than be grateful.

536
00:35:50,651 --> 00:35:52,903
Yeah,
that's probably true.

537
00:35:52,986 --> 00:35:55,072
Um, you could lie.
Feel free.

538
00:35:55,155 --> 00:35:59,076
No, you're probably right. So that doesn't
exactly make me want to come clean here.

539
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:02,079
Which I have nothing to come
clean about, okay? Honestly.

540
00:36:02,162 --> 00:36:04,081
It's just-

541
00:36:04,164 --> 00:36:06,834
I-I just feel that I would.
I-I do.

542
00:36:12,089 --> 00:36:14,091
Because I think you're pretty amazing...

543
00:36:14,174 --> 00:36:17,344
if the, uh, truth be known.

544
00:36:19,429 --> 00:36:22,391
And you're almost married,
so why shouldn't it be?

545
00:36:22,474 --> 00:36:24,476
Uh, the truth, I mean.

546
00:36:36,113 --> 00:36:38,115
Thank you.

547
00:36:42,786 --> 00:36:44,788
Not a problem.

548
00:36:47,457 --> 00:36:49,376
Anyway, that's all I know.

549
00:36:49,459 --> 00:36:51,795
Which is nothing.
Okay!

550
00:36:55,632 --> 00:36:57,634
Hwah!

551
00:37:10,147 --> 00:37:12,107
I'm just being stupid.

552
00:37:12,191 --> 00:37:14,109
Hey.

553
00:37:14,359 --> 00:37:16,695
If you feel it, it's not stupid.

554
00:37:25,996 --> 00:37:27,915
God!

555
00:37:33,253 --> 00:37:35,214
You're a lovely person.
You know that?

556
00:37:35,255 --> 00:37:37,216
" Lovely"?

557
00:37:37,257 --> 00:37:40,219
Jesus, why don't you just
call me gay and get it over with?

558
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:42,888
Hey! Lovely is nice.

559
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:45,891
No, I wish there were a few more
lovely people in the world.

560
00:37:45,933 --> 00:37:48,268
I mean it. You are.

561
00:37:50,437 --> 00:37:54,733
And getting cuter by the day.
What is that girl doing to you?

562
00:37:54,775 --> 00:37:56,735
Lots.

563
00:37:56,777 --> 00:37:58,779
She's amazing. Really.

564
00:38:00,781 --> 00:38:02,908
What happened to your glasses?

565
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:04,910
- Are you wearing-
- No! Adam!

566
00:38:04,952 --> 00:38:07,412
- Are those contacts?
- Yep.

567
00:38:07,454 --> 00:38:09,414
Contacts.
Oh, my God.

568
00:38:09,456 --> 00:38:12,417
This from the former
tape-around-the-nose-thing champion.

569
00:38:12,459 --> 00:38:15,420
That was only for, like, a week!
That one time!

570
00:38:15,462 --> 00:38:17,923
I know, but still, you gotta admit-

571
00:38:17,965 --> 00:38:20,592
I do. It's great.
I feel better.

572
00:38:20,634 --> 00:38:23,929
" Better."
I mean, you're, like, this totally hot guy now.

573
00:38:23,971 --> 00:38:28,433
No. No, I mean, I always thought
you were handsome before, but...

574
00:38:28,475 --> 00:38:31,353
I didn't think you'd go in
for the makeover thing.

575
00:38:31,436 --> 00:38:33,355
Me either.

576
00:38:33,438 --> 00:38:35,357
Who knew?

577
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,442
Well, apparently she did.

578
00:38:49,955 --> 00:38:52,374
You are still seeing her, aren't you?

579
00:38:52,457 --> 00:38:55,043
Oh, yeah. She's-

580
00:38:55,127 --> 00:38:58,046
You don't hold a grudge, do ya?
All she said that night-

581
00:38:58,130 --> 00:39:01,049
Oh, God, I couldn't believe that!
No, it was great.

582
00:39:01,133 --> 00:39:05,053
No, truthfully, it was. I mean, Phil needed
to hear every word of that.

583
00:39:05,137 --> 00:39:07,556
He did, too.
Hear it, I mean.

584
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:10,559
You know, he even said something
after you guys left.

585
00:39:10,642 --> 00:39:13,061
I mean, not an admittance
of guilt, exactly,

586
00:39:13,145 --> 00:39:15,731
but as close to one as we're
likely to hear from the guy.

587
00:39:15,814 --> 00:39:18,233
Really? What'd he say? I'm amazed.
As was I.

588
00:39:18,317 --> 00:39:21,236
He put on quite the show.
I remember vaguely.

589
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,238
They both did.

590
00:39:23,322 --> 00:39:26,241
Anyway, later on
he said something like,

591
00:39:26,325 --> 00:39:28,327
" He could do worse."

592
00:39:29,369 --> 00:39:31,330
Not exactly a seal of approval.

593
00:39:31,371 --> 00:39:33,790
No, but a lot for him.

594
00:39:34,791 --> 00:39:36,793
And after what she said?

595
00:39:38,337 --> 00:39:40,255
You're right.

596
00:39:40,339 --> 00:39:42,257
Huh.

597
00:39:42,341 --> 00:39:45,928
Hey, her middle name's
not Jenny or anything, is it?

598
00:39:46,011 --> 00:39:48,263
No such luck.
Whew!

599
00:39:48,347 --> 00:39:50,933
No, it's Ann.

600
00:39:51,016 --> 00:39:53,936
Evelyn Ann Thompson.

601
00:39:54,019 --> 00:39:55,938
It's nice, right?

602
00:39:56,021 --> 00:39:57,940
Eat?

603
00:39:58,023 --> 00:39:59,942
What?

604
00:40:00,025 --> 00:40:01,944
Eat.
Those are her initials.

605
00:40:02,027 --> 00:40:03,946
The acronym of her name is E-A-T.

606
00:40:04,029 --> 00:40:06,949
Hey, that's cute.
Oh, God, you're a goner.

607
00:40:07,032 --> 00:40:09,117
I know.
It's pathetic, isn't it?

608
00:40:09,201 --> 00:40:11,453
Somewhat.
But lovely.

609
00:40:11,537 --> 00:40:13,539
No, not that again!

610
00:40:14,748 --> 00:40:17,292
What the heck is this?

611
00:40:17,376 --> 00:40:19,294
- What is this?
- What?

612
00:40:19,378 --> 00:40:22,297
Did you stop biting your nails?
Yeah, for, like, a month now.

613
00:40:22,381 --> 00:40:24,800
Don't tell me she--
It's true.

614
00:40:24,883 --> 00:40:27,803
She gave me some kind of crap to put
on 'em, and that was it. I just stopped.

615
00:40:27,886 --> 00:40:30,055
You have nails!
This is crazy!

616
00:40:30,138 --> 00:40:32,099
It's no biggie.

617
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:35,102
The whole time I've known you-
three years now-

618
00:40:35,143 --> 00:40:37,729
Your fingers have looked
like raw meat.

619
00:40:37,813 --> 00:40:39,773
Anyway, awful.

620
00:40:39,815 --> 00:40:42,901
And now you just quit.
This girl is the messiah.

621
00:40:42,985 --> 00:40:46,071
I've quit before.
For, like, an hour.

622
00:40:46,154 --> 00:40:48,115
I love this woman.

623
00:40:48,156 --> 00:40:50,117
Me too.

624
00:40:50,158 --> 00:40:52,661
Yeah, I can see that.
Wow.

625
00:40:59,168 --> 00:41:02,129
And you'd really tell me
if you knew something?

626
00:41:02,171 --> 00:41:04,173
I would, yes.
Okay.

627
00:41:07,509 --> 00:41:10,179
Geez, when did you get so cute?

628
00:41:16,185 --> 00:41:19,188
Whew.

629
00:41:38,165 --> 00:41:40,083
Shit.

630
00:41:40,167 --> 00:41:42,294
Yeah.

631
00:41:45,005 --> 00:41:47,925
What was that all about?
I don't know.

632
00:41:48,008 --> 00:41:50,177
Uh, I'm not sure.

633
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:53,055
Look, I'm sorry.

634
00:41:53,138 --> 00:41:56,058
- No. Don't be.
- I am.

635
00:41:56,141 --> 00:41:59,603
Uh, I'm the one with the ring on.

636
00:41:59,686 --> 00:42:02,314
Yeah, it's...
my friend's ring.

637
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:06,276
Good point.
Thanks for reminding me.

638
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,320
You're welcome.

639
00:42:15,536 --> 00:42:17,454
Aw, dang it!

640
00:42:17,538 --> 00:42:20,624
Oh, no, listen,
it wasn't because of,

641
00:42:20,707 --> 00:42:24,127
You know, my worries or whatever,
how I'm feeling about Philip right now.

642
00:42:24,211 --> 00:42:26,171
It wasn't.
Okay.

643
00:42:27,714 --> 00:42:29,633
It just-
Happened.

644
00:42:29,716 --> 00:42:31,635
Right.

645
00:42:39,142 --> 00:42:42,145
I've wanted to do that for a long time.

646
00:42:43,438 --> 00:42:45,399
Three years.

647
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,442
Me too.

648
00:42:58,829 --> 00:43:02,249
Now we take it down to the--
the beach and bury it.

649
00:43:02,332 --> 00:43:04,251
Don't we?

650
00:43:04,334 --> 00:43:06,587
Yeah, we do.
Of course.

651
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:10,257
Um...
don't you want to?

652
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:12,259
Bury it?

653
00:43:12,342 --> 00:43:14,261
Yes. Or--

654
00:43:14,344 --> 00:43:16,263
No. No, we can't talk about it.

655
00:43:16,346 --> 00:43:18,348
Don't even say the-

656
00:43:19,683 --> 00:43:22,603
God. Do you have
a shovel in your car?

657
00:43:22,686 --> 00:43:24,605
Uh, I don't, no.

658
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:29,026
But... I have my car.

659
00:43:31,111 --> 00:43:33,113
My bike's right over there.

660
00:43:34,615 --> 00:43:38,118
Then it... 
should be fine if we were to...

661
00:43:39,453 --> 00:43:41,455
go to the beach.

662
00:43:42,539 --> 00:43:44,541
I suppose so.

663
00:43:47,794 --> 00:43:50,088
Good.

664
00:43:52,132 --> 00:43:55,135
Oh, come on.
We should go bury this.

665
00:43:57,804 --> 00:43:59,806
On the beach.

666
00:44:46,562 --> 00:44:48,522
What time did they say?

667
00:44:48,564 --> 00:44:50,524
10:30.
It's 10:50 now.

668
00:44:50,566 --> 00:44:53,527
No big deal. You always wait
at the doctor's office.

669
00:44:53,569 --> 00:44:56,864
I know. I just had to be
at work by 12:00.

670
00:44:56,905 --> 00:44:59,199
Today?

671
00:44:59,241 --> 00:45:01,201
Yeah, I told you that.

672
00:45:01,243 --> 00:45:03,203
No, you didn't.
Yeah, I did.

673
00:45:03,245 --> 00:45:05,205
I always work Wednesdays.

674
00:45:05,247 --> 00:45:07,749
Really?
Yeah. Every Wednesday.

675
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:11,920
It's okay.
I can be late if I have to.

676
00:45:12,004 --> 00:45:13,922
Are you sure?
Yeah.

677
00:45:14,006 --> 00:45:16,925
I mean, they hate it,
but I'll come up with something.

678
00:45:17,009 --> 00:45:19,595
Or we can go.
No.

679
00:45:19,678 --> 00:45:21,763
I wanna do this. I do.

680
00:45:21,847 --> 00:45:26,393
I mean, w-who wouldn't want to pay a lot
of money to get their nose chopped off?

681
00:45:28,228 --> 00:45:32,357
Well, you're only talking to them
anyway. That's all.

682
00:45:32,399 --> 00:45:34,902
It's just weird to think-
People do it all the time.

683
00:45:34,985 --> 00:45:36,987
Especially out here.

684
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:42,367
Right.
No, you're right. You're right.

685
00:45:44,036 --> 00:45:48,081
- I just never imagined myself to be one of those people.
- I'm one of those people.

686
00:45:48,165 --> 00:45:50,042
What? you are not.
Take a look.

687
00:45:50,083 --> 00:45:52,419
Where?

688
00:45:56,298 --> 00:45:59,259
I don't see anything.
Exactly.

689
00:45:59,301 --> 00:46:01,261
You got your nose done?
Honestly?
