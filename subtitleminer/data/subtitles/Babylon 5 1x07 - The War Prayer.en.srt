00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:11,753
- The last poem you read.
- "In the Light of Two Moons."

2
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,190
Did I not hear it when we were-?

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,712
Both too young to know
anything about anything.

4
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:23,118
We could only feel and wonder
what it all meant.

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,556
But you recall correctly.

6
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,390
I did start it then,
poor and groping for meaning.

7
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,798
It has matured
and changed over the years.

8
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:38,272
I finally knew it was ready.
Tonight was its first performance.

9
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,637
- I remember it.
- I thought you might.

10
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,956
Our lives were simpler then.

11
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,315
Do you regret the choices
that you made to be here?

12
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,714
Sometimes.

13
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,751
Only sometimes. You?

14
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,152
I would be nothing other
than what I am.

15
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,199
- It's been a long day.
- I have kept you too late.

16
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,996
I have a performance in the morning
and must prepare to go to Earth.

17
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,471
I hope humans appreciate
the spirit you bring.

18
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,831
If they do not, I shall
retire to a doxhouse...

19
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:20,033
...and devote my remaining years
to the songs of Heefa.

20
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,232
It is good to have you here, Mayan.

21
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:35,399
- Shall I walk you to your quarters?
- Thank you, dear friend.

22
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,990
But I'm sure your day
begins even earlier than mine.

23
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,391
- Good night then.
- Good night.

24
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,679
Stay away from Earth, freak!

25
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,757
It was the dawn
of the Third Age of mankind...

26
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,793
...10 years after
the Earth-Minbari War.

27
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,878
The Babylon Project
was a dream given form.

28
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,356
Its goal: to prevent another war
by creating a place...

29
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:40,399
...where humans and aliens
could work out their differences.

30
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,273
It's a port of call,
home away from home...

31
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,718
...for diplomats, hustlers,
entrepreneurs and wanderers.

32
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:52,113
Humans and aliens,
wrapped in 2,500,000 tons...

33
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:56,956
...of spinning metal,
all alone in the night.

34
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,436
It can be a dangerous place.

35
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,393
But it's our last,
best hope for peace.

36
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:06,195
This is the story of the last
of the Babylon stations.

37
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,550
The year is 2258.

38
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:13,038
The name of the place is Babylon 5.

39
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,798
This is an outrage, commander!
An outrage!

40
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,117
Shaal Mayan is a cultural
treasure of my people!

41
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:05,030
This brutal attack affects not only
her but the soul of my entire race!

42
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,997
We'll get the attacker.

43
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,512
Will that take away Mayan's pain,
her terror, her humiliation?

44
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,518
She refused my offer for an escort.

45
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,473
She did not think
anyone wished her harm.

46
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,674
There was a time when one could walk
through Green Sector without escorts!

47
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,475
We' re doing everything
we can to correct that.

48
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:31,276
Then you are required to do better,
commander. Much better!

49
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,833
This is the sixth attack
on a prominent alien in two weeks.

50
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,237
Earth and Mars have had
a rash of similar incidents.

51
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,000
- Home Guard?
- That brand is their calling card.

52
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:49,159
Their numbers are growing
along with other pro-Earth groups.

53
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,429
Pro-Earth?

54
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:54,189
They're playing off fear
to turn human against alien.

55
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,755
But I won't have it on Babylon 5.

56
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,191
- I want these scum, Michael.
- I'll do my best.

57
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,030
But there's many who agree with them,
and even more who don't give a damn.

58
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,195
Then make them give a damn!

59
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,670
I've just been informed of the latest
atrocity committed by your people.

60
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,753
My people did not attack Shaal Mayan.

61
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,636
Whoever did will be found and punished
to the full extent of the law.

62
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,434
I have no special love
for the Minbari.

63
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:29,555
But I warn you, if any Narn is harmed
in this way, there'll be retribution!

64
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:34,231
And I warn you, any disruption
of Babylon 5 will be dealt with...

65
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,877
...even if I have to throw the entire
Narn population into the brig.

66
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,957
Now, if you'll excuse me.

67
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,348
All I could see was a shadow.
I'm sorry.

68
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,516
This shadow, was it humanoid,
alien, big, small?

69
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,838
It was a shadow.
That is all that I know.

70
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,918
That, and the pain...

71
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,553
...and this.

72
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,597
Is there anyone here
who has reason to harm you?

73
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,679
Mr. Garibaldi,
I create and perform ti'la...

74
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:15,318
...poem songs that attempt to recall
old memories and prompt new ideas.

75
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,548
While a number of them have provoked
discussions of some heat...

76
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:24,150
...I have never before
been stabbed and branded.

77
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,396
Thank you for your time.

78
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,831
- I could remove that mark-
- No.

79
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,991
It is a lesson.

80
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,388
One that should not be forgotten.

81
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,712
Babylon Control
to Centauri liner Carbo...

82
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,559
...we'll take custody
of the detainees.

83
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,753
- What kind? Raiders? Hijackers?
- Unknown.

84
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:58,192
He said they don't look dangerous
and he wants to hand them over.

85
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,391
- If you have a minute-
- I don't.

86
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,313
I'm up to my eyeballs
with these attacks.

87
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,670
- One minute.
- I don't have one.

88
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,190
Would you like me to get
the commander to do it?

89
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,113
- Okay, all right, I'll do it.
- Good.

90
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:16,279
Quick stop first. I found
an illegal planter in the garden.

91
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,278
Someone's using our
hydroponic system to grow coffee.

92
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,274
We all know the garden's only
for fruits, vegetables, grains...

93
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,716
...so I figured I'd rip it out
of the planter.

94
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:32,711
It's too bad. The beans looked ripe
and coffee is so expensive to import.

95
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,478
I'm taking a walk, so I might
as well pick up the detainees.

96
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,795
You're vicious.

97
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,236
I'm head of security.
It's in the job description.

98
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:50,071
Let go! I am a Centauri citizen.
You have no right to manhandle me.

99
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,555
We demand to see Ambassador Cotto!

100
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:56,548
Lead them to Blue 5 and inform
the Centauri representative.

101
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,394
Susan.

102
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,632
It's been a long time.

103
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,913
It's been eight years, Malcolm.
What are you doing here?

104
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:15,148
I'm looking for something.
Something I never stopped wanting.

105
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,354
- I have to go. I have duties.
- Same old Susan. Duty first.

106
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,877
That's right. Enjoy your stay.

107
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,759
- But you wrote that you were ambassador.
- It's difficult to explain right now.

108
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,480
This is a great
disappointment, cousin.

109
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,110
All right, Sinclair,
what is it this time?

110
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,437
- I suggest you ask Ambassador Cotto.
- Who?

111
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:46,475
Ambassador Mollari, may I present
Aria Tensus and my cousin, Kiron Maray.

112
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,910
They arrived from Centauri Prime...

113
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,510
...and were taken into custody
by Earthforce security!

114
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,395
Can you explain this affront
to our noble citizens?

115
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,637
Your noble citizens
had stolen credit chips.

116
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,353
Oh, I see.

117
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:06,350
I'll release them into your custody
pending further investigation.

118
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,516
What am I supposed to do?

119
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,669
You' re always saying the Centauri are
an advanced race. You figure it out.

120
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,954
So you do take a break
every now and then.

121
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,994
- Actually, my shift just ended.
- Then maybe we can talk.

122
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:39,351
There was a time when you and I
would spend entire evenings...

123
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,996
...just talking, when we weren't...

124
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:50,833
That was a long time ago, Malcolm.
A different place, a different me.

125
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,713
All the more reason to start over.

126
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,835
- I'm tired. I have to go.
- Susan.

127
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,834
It's been eight years.
Let's take it slow, all right?

128
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:13,108
So when marriages were arranged
for them, they fled here.

129
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,231
Yes, but why?

130
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,637
I'm to marry the ugliest woman
on Centauri Prime.

131
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,031
She is to marry a man
as old as her grandfather!

132
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,912
Ugly and old, yes?

133
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,317
Then their families
must be rich and powerful.

134
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:31,638
Your parents made fine choices.
I still don't see the problem!

135
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:36,231
- We don't want to marry anyone else!
- We want to marry each other.

136
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,790
- We love each other.
- Love?!

137
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,754
What does love have to do
with marriage?!

138
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,759
My dear, beautiful children.

139
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:58,157
Consider for a moment
what you are doing.

140
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,990
For a thousand years, marriages have
been arranged among our people.

141
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,954
Marriages which meld
the noble houses together...

142
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,789
...and keep the fabric
of the Republic strong.

143
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,915
Sometimes, these marriages
call for sacrifice.

144
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,279
Great sacrifice.

145
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,836
But we make this sacrifice...

146
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,272
...because this is what it means
to be Centauri!

147
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,355
If you deny this tradition,
you lose the very thing...

148
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:35,917
...which makes you what you are.
Do you understand?

149
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,190
But it's so unfair!

150
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,715
Are you aware of the
regulations regarding weapons?

151
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,516
I got a right to defend myself!
You've seen the things around here.

152
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,555
- They could tear a man's head off!
- Were you doing that the other night?

153
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,193
What do you mean?

154
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:05,029
Mayan was attacked.
There's fresh blood on your knife.

155
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,476
It's mine.
I cut myself opening a crate.

156
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:13,390
- Ever hear of the Home Guard?
- Yeah, sure. They got the right idea.

157
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,956
It's about time we humans
stood up for our rights!

158
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,391
Damn aliens are ruining
everything for us!

159
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,834
Book him for the weapon
and run a DNA check on that blood.

160
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,919
- What the hell is this crap?!
- I don't like your attitude.

161
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:34,035
If the blood matches, I'll give you
over to the Minbari and let them play!

162
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,151
I don't know what's worse:

163
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,830
Damn aliens or the traitors
who suck up to them!

164
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,951
Get him out of here!

165
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,436
Earth Alliance transport,
proceed to jumpgate.

166
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,278
Roger, Babylon Control.

167
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:14,875
Ambassador Kosh, I thought
I'd make sure you'd been informed.

168
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:18,038
There have been attacks
on non-humanoids.

169
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,677
We' re thoroughly investigating it
and hope to wrap it up soon.

170
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,514
Good.

171
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,589
Meanwhile, it might be helpful if you
spoke with the other ambassadors.

172
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,957
We take no interest
in the affairs of others.

173
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,998
I hope you'll reconsider.
If you could give us a hand, we-

174
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,474
Yes?

175
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,151
Nothing. We'll respect your wishes.

176
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:52,076
That's quite a viewer. I've never
seen anything quite like it before.

177
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,998
- What is it?
- Efficient.

178
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:58,798
Those are images from my world.
If I may ask, what are you-?

179
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,758
- I am studying.
- Studying what?

180
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,315
Ambassador?

181
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,869
- Any word from Earth Central?
- No.

182
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:49,591
There's something I've been thinking
about all day. I can't forget it.

183
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,915
What's that?

184
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,159
Were you briefed on what happened
when Ambassador Kosh arrived?

185
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,636
A radical Minbari organization
tried to kill him.

186
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,553
He was poisoned through the hand.

187
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,958
Talking with Kosh, I remembered
something I never figured out.

188
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,836
His suit protects him from our
atmosphere, so how'd he get poisoned?

189
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,315
His hand should've been covered.

190
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,959
Vorlons are secretive.

191
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:19,199
And they hide what they look like,
how their biology works.

192
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:24,554
Who knows if the suit is necessary
or if it camouflages what's inside?

193
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:29,072
The only person who knows is
Dr. Ben Kyle, who saved Kosh's life.

194
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,555
Bound by oath of confidentiality...

195
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:35,429
...he never told me what he saw
inside the encounter suit.

196
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:40,668
Right after that, he was transferred
to Earth to work with the president.

197
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,839
Lyta Alexander, the only
Psi Corps member to scan a Vorlon...

198
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,558
...was transferred back.

199
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:51,356
- You think there's a connection?
- I don't know. Maybe.

200
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,752
Do you know how much trouble
these lovebirds have given me?

201
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,832
I have a dozen messages
from Centauri Prime.

202
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:05,396
The families are outraged
and are after my head!

203
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,114
- What will you do?
- What will I do?

204
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,632
Send them home where they belong
and hope they come to their senses!

205
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:17,118
- But they love each other.
- Love. Overrated!

206
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,915
Here, look.

207
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,671
These are my three wives:

208
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,511
Pestilence, famine and death.

209
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,598
Did I marry them
for their personalities?

210
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:34,070
Their personalities could
shatter entire planets.

211
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,555
Arranged marriages, every one.

212
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,399
But they worked out. They inspired me.

213
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,559
Knowing that they were waiting
at home for me keeps me here.

214
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,393
Seventy-five light-years away.

215
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:52,190
- They' re just going to run away again.
- Happily, that's not my problem.

216
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:57,474
Now, you go find your little lovebirds
and tell them to be ready.

217
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:02,589
A transport is leaving for Centauri
Prime tonight and I want them on it.

218
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,712
If you need me, I'll be in the Casino.

219
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,592
Commander.

220
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,755
The Abbai delegation is docking.

221
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:21,316
Have a liaison officer
meet them at customs.

222
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:27,392
- You wanted to see me?
- You have a suspect in Mayan's assault?

223
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,149
Had. DNA scan showed
the blood on his knife was his.

224
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,033
He fit the profile, though.
A hate freak.

225
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,959
- You let him go?
- Under surveillance.

226
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:42,188
He's more useful running loose. He's
a logical recruit for the Home Guard.

227
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,550
Good. What else have you found?

228
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:48,594
I haven't had time. There's been
fights all over the station.

229
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,917
- Things are getting ugly.
- That's what they want.

230
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:56,830
If Babylon 5 becomes a war zone, all
we've worked for will be destroyed.

231
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:00,191
- We better wrap this one up quickly.
- I know.

232
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:08,517
We had some good times together.

233
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,910
Yeah, we sure did.

234
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,070
Tell me, do you...

235
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,189
Do you ever regret leaving me?

236
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,833
Regret?

237
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,874
No.

238
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:27,119
lo was a great career move.
It opened a lot of doors...

239
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,198
...and serving there
was very exciting for me...

240
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,915
...even if I cried myself to sleep
the first few months.

241
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:38,557
I never wanted to let you go.
I feel the same today.

242
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:43,670
I'm still committed to my career.
And you know what that means.

243
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,599
And I can accept that now.

244
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,317
Which is why I'm going
into business here.

245
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,635
What?

246
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,912
This is the first time
I've ever surprised you.

247
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,556
- But you' re not serious, are you?
- Absolutely.

248
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:02,639
In fact, I've already secured
an office and quarters.

249
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:07,960
All I need is a few more clients.
I hope you might help me with that.

250
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,836
But the important thing is
that we'll be together again.

251
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,553
Right?

252
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,431
Kiron! Aria!

253
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,596
Let's get out of here!

254
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,354
Kiron.

255
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:07,875
He's in a coma. Thoracic wound,
PPG at close range.

256
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,959
- He's in Intensive Care in Medlab 2.
- How's Aria?

257
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:16,517
Stunned with a shock stick. Scared.
Physically, she'll be fine.

258
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,875
- Does she remember anything?
- No.

259
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,195
And the boy?

260
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:24,353
He may be able to identify
his attacker if he wakes up.

261
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:30,078
Chief, we have a disturbance
in Central Corridor, Brown Sector.

262
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,910
We can no longer stand idly by...

263
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:37,635
...as our peoples are slaughtered
by cowardly humans!

264
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,833
We must fight back
with every means at our disposal!

265
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,155
He's right!

266
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:50,479
- Is there a problem, Ambassador G'Kar?
- Problem, indeed!

267
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:54,719
Eight non-humans brutally attacked
in the space of two weeks...

268
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,037
...and you have yet to make
even a single arrest!

269
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,677
- We have a lead in the last incident-
- Spare us the usual platitudes.

270
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,589
You know very well
why these crimes remain unsolved.

271
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:10,514
It is because
the perpetrators are human!

272
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,559
- I want you out of here now!
- Not until they listen.

273
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,593
Anything you say will
only make them hotter.

274
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:24,918
Get out of here and let me do my job.
I promise I'll be gentle.

275
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:29,358
So this is your response, Sinclair?

276
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:33,633
So much for Babylon 5's
highly vaunted justice!

277
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:39,119
Justice, you'll taste firsthand.
I'll charge you with inciting to riot.

278
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:42,949
Or you can leave
and we'll call it a misunderstanding.

279
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,428
Che duga. You. You, I hear.

280
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,269
- You one who hunts.
- Out of my way!

281
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,988
Thank you. I had a lovely evening.

282
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:48,591
Well, I was hoping
that it wasn't over.

283
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,394
Yet.

284
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,949
- That's not too flattering.
- It's duty. Ivanova here.

285
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:07,914
- We've had a near riot. I need you.
- I'm on my way.

286
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,037
- You have to go.
- A riot?

287
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,117
Malcolm, out!

288
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,915
- Catch you on your next break?
- Yes.

289
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,230
It's cooled down. But we've had a few
incidents, one involving Roberts.

290
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,555
How serious?

291
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:36,191
He's in Medlab. We had him on
surveillance. We nabbed the perps.

292
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:41,838
Keep it quiet. This could provoke more
trouble. I could strangle that G'Kar.

293
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,155
Love your new look.

294
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,670
I'd think you'd have something
else on your mind.

295
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,474
- Sir?
- Let's begin.

296
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,868
Aria.

297
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:04,670
- I'm so sorry.
- My dear child, don't worry.

298
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:08,828
Kiron will be fine.
Dr. Franklin is a veritable wizard.

299
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,878
- They won't let me near him.
- Of course not.

300
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:17,831
But he wouldn't want that.
If he senses I'm here, he'll recover.

301
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,758
I know it.

302
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,952
- Can't you do something?
- Go back and rest.

303
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:27,870
- There's nothing you can do here.
- I'm not leaving Kiron.

304
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,559
Ambassador.

305
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,031
You should listen to her.

306
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,949
We Minbari consider love
a potent force for healing.

307
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:45,393
She cares deeply for him. Such feelings
can turn the tide when all else fails.

308
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,798
Oh, I see. And if he dies
despite this great power of love-

309
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,992
If he dies, she will
suffer enormous grief.

310
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,879
But every moment together
will lessen it.

311
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,390
I would expect such logic from a poet.

312
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:02,950
What can a Minbari know
about Centauri feeling?

313
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:06,118
I have traveled far and seen much.

314
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:10,637
What I've seen tells me all
sentient beings are best defined...

315
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,798
...by their capacity
and their need for love.

316
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,679
And she will learn to live without it!

317
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,029
As you did?

318
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:34,035
- You wanted to see me?
- Roberts had an interesting visitor.

319
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,119
Computer, play surveillance tape 917,
count 16.

320
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,038
Commencing.

321
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:49,472
I know that man. He was in
Ivanova's quarters last night.

322
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,996
Mr. Roberts? I'm Malcolm Biggs.

323
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,515
What's happened to you is...

324
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,870
Well, it's a disgrace.

325
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,952
Tell me about it.

326
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:04,073
There are some of us who don't like
what's happening here.

327
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:07,670
Alien ambassadors
setting policy for humans.

328
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,553
Alien workers
taking jobs from humans.

329
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,593
Inhuman criminals preying...

330
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,758
...on decent people like yourself.

331
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,633
We want to put a stop to that.

332
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:24,069
And we think you can help us.

333
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,874
End of recording.

334
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,677
I never would've dreamed...

335
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,078
A man can change a lot in 8 years.
There's no reason you should've known.

336
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,796
What is it you wanted me to do?

337
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,676
Introduce me. Say I'm unhappy with
aliens forcing themselves on Earth.

338
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,668
Groups like this like to recruit
friends in high places.

339
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:53,834
If they accept me, we may be able to
nail them before they do more damage.

340
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,593
Very well.

341
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,711
- On one condition.
- Name it.

342
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,792
I wanna be there
when you take them down.

343
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:11,674
There's a diplomatic reception tonight.
That might be a good way to start.

344
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,393
As you wish.

345
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:41,834
- I've been looking everywhere for you.
- Yes, what do you want?

346
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,708
- To tell you something.
- Well?

347
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,829
- You were wrong.
- What?

348
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:55,079
Kiron and Aria wanna be together
because they love each other.

349
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:58,158
Would that destroy
the Centauri Republic?

350
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:02,592
- We cannot turn our back on tradition.
- Damn tradition!

351
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,991
Kiron may die because
our glorious tradition...

352
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:09,078
...values wealth and power over love.

353
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:12,078
My shoes are too tight.

354
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,759
Excuse me?

355
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,349
Something my father said.

356
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,192
He was...

357
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,914
...old.

358
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:22,429
Very old at the time.

359
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:26,109
I went into his room...

360
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:30,473
...and he was sitting alone
in the dark, crying.

361
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,549
So I asked him what was wrong.

362
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,716
And he said:

363
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,918
" My shoes are too tight.

364
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,350
But it doesn't matter...

365
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:47,919
...because I have forgotten
how to dance."

366
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:51,516
I never understood
what that meant until now.

367
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,833
My shoes are too tight...

368
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,433
...and I have forgotten how to dance.

369
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,468
I don't understand.

370
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,278
Nor should you.

371
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,272
Commander Sinclair.

372
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,675
May I introduce Mila Shar...

373
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,555
...head of the agricultural delegation
from Abba Four.

374
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:46,237
We look forward to studying
your hydroponic cultivation methods.

375
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,796
- I hear they' re most successful.
- They should be.

376
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,709
The best technos from Earth set it up.
It's state of the art.

377
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:58,311
- Your security is equally efficient?
- Absolutely.

378
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:02,433
We understand there have been
attacks on non-humans lately.

379
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,319
I'm concerned about our delegates.

380
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,358
Don't be. Everything is under control.

381
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:13,156
But wasn't a Centauri youth
seriously injured just last night?

382
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,437
He'll recover.

383
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,198
- They' re nervous.
- About what?

384
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:31,991
The recent attacks.
They' re afraid they' re next.

385
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:35,909
What if they are?
On the Line, we had a motto:

386
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:40,318
"The only good alien is a dead alien."
True then, true now.

387
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:45,389
The job description says I must play
diplomat. I don't have to like it.

388
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:56,238
- Were you in the war?
- No, I missed it.

389
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:59,113
Sit down. Let me tell you something.

390
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:03,233
I fought. My best friends died...

391
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:07,389
...and we won.
Not because we out-fought them.

392
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,956
Not because we were luckier,
stronger or smarter.

393
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:14,470
We won because the damn Minbari
let us win.

394
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:18,229
You know what that victory
tasted like? Ashes.

395
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:23,433
You'd be surprised
how many times I've heard that.

396
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,274
There's a movement back on Earth.

397
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:31,873
It's growing, gaining in support
from people just like you.

398
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,433
So I've heard.

399
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,359
We want to put Earth back
at the center of the universe.

400
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,959
Our universe.

401
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,756
Get rid of alien influences!
Get rid of aliens!

402
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,791
Put Earth first!

403
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:48,952
We must get back to our roots.

404
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:53,712
Let's let humans be humans!

405
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,515
Who's we?

406
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:11,759
Friends of mine.
And perhaps soon of yours.

407
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,151
I want you to meet them.

408
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,598
Both of you.

409
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,431
I'd like that.

410
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,914
Yes.

411
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:26,353
Of course, we must be discreet.
Not everyone agrees with us.

412
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:32,112
So I'd like a small gesture.
To show where your sentiments lie.

413
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,595
What sort of gesture?

414
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:39,515
Something to put every alien
on this station in their place.

415
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,432
To Earth!

416
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,675
I know you' re concerned
about the violence onboard.

417
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,348
There is no longer any danger.

418
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:03,758
Good! You've arrested the criminals!
Why weren't we informed?

419
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,632
Mr. Garibaldi.

420
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:10,353
We have good reason to believe
the perpetrators fled to Earth.

421
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:13,996
- You identified them?
- That information is classified.

422
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:17,954
- Why is it classified?
- Do you think we are pouchlings?

423
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:21,118
Are we to believe that
they are simply gone?

424
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:24,551
- I do not accept a word of it!
- Neither do I!

425
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,591
Believe what you like.

426
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:31,271
The fact is the investigation
is over! Thank you.

427
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,077
Dr. Franklin!

428
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,358
Welcome back.

429
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,312
How do you feel?

430
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,313
Tired.

431
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,112
Well, that'll pass.

432
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:53,279
When you're up to it,
Mr. Garibaldi has some questions.

433
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:58,600
And Ambassador Mollari wants
to have a long talk with both of you.

434
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,838
- Malcolm set the meeting.
- Where is it?

435
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:16,194
He won't tell me. He'll meet us and
take us there. We 're to be unarmed.

436
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,590
- He's cagey.
- I expected that.

437
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:22,958
You can monitor us. If they
suspect us, this could be a trap.

438
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:26,550
I'll be all ears. You need us,
we' re there. Good luck.

439
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:31,231
You'll be able to travel in
a few days. I've made arrangements.

440
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,470
- But-
- No more arguments.

441
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:37,468
You will return to Centauri Prime
as is your duty!

442
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:40,074
However, upon arrival...

443
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:43,716
...you'll be met by Andilo Mollari,
my second cousin.

444
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:47,589
He will escort you
to his estate in the capital...

445
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:52,715
...where you will enter a period
of fosterage until you are adults.

446
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,951
- I don't understand.
- Fosterage?

447
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,628
A common practice in the old days.

448
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,997
Seldom done nowadays,
the law still allows it.

449
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,795
Vir, very impressive.
I can see you've been studying.

450
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,992
You will live with Andilo
and his wives.

451
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:14,175
They will instruct you in proper
decorum for Centauris of your rank.

452
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,237
Our parents will object.

453
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:20,115
I doubt it. You see,
Andilo is a very powerful man.

454
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,312
It is a great honor
to be fostered by him.

455
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,398
To object would be
to defy all tradition.

456
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,158
What will become of us?

457
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:31,750
You will study our culture,
learning all you can.

458
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:37,956
When you are old enough, Andilo will
let you decide for yourselves...

459
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,111
...whom you wish to marry!

460
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,754
Even if it's only for love?

461
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,439
- If you insist!
- Thank you.

462
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:50,791
All right, enough.
You two need to rest.

463
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,195
Now, we'll talk more later.

464
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,913
Ambassador.

465
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,673
Why?

466
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,555
Because. You are still children.

467
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:04,639
And children should be
allowed to dance.

468
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,754
Vir.

469
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,716
They're entering Cargo Bay 5.

470
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,758
This is it.

471
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,712
Where are the others?

472
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,434
Already here, commander.

473
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:57,349
Worth, activate the jammer.
Alvarez, on scan.

474
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:02,918
- We don't want to be disturbed.
- I'm impressed.

475
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,752
What are those things?

476
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,509
Black-light camouflage,
developed by Earthforce.

477
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:14,759
They' re still under wraps in R and D,
but our friends got us prototypes.

478
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:19,238
We have friends everywhere.
We hope you'll be one of them.

479
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,870
- I'll help any way I can.
- We're counting on it.

480
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:26,277
- Worth, is the jammer up?
- Perimeter secured.

481
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:29,753
Damn! They jammed us. Let's move.

482
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:35,432
The recent attacks on Earth, Mars
and here were just a prelude.

483
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:40,670
In two days' time,
there'll be a mass assassination.

484
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:46,278
In one night, we'll take out the four
major ambassadors stationed here.

485
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:51,430
Mollari, Delenn, G'Kar and Kosh.

486
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:56,914
Their deaths will be a signal
to terminate the ambassadors on Earth.

487
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:00,715
But the scale of it.
You'd need hundreds of people.

488
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:03,480
As he said, we got friends everywhere.

489
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:08,113
Clear it out, clear it out!
Coming through, coming through!

490
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,550
What do you want us to do?

491
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,194
Get us into the ambassadorial wing...

492
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:19,875
...and off the station undetected
after we've finished.

493
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:25,318
- No problem.
- Good.

494
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:29,190
Then there's just one more thing.

495
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,990
I call it a little loyalty test.

496
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,114
Commander, please!

497
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,834
- I don't know what these men-
- Shut up!

498
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,871
- Kill it.
- No, please. No! Please!

499
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:53,756
Come on, you said it yourself.
The only good alien is a dead one!

500
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:57,032
Have mercy on me, commander, please.

501
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,513
Malcolm.

502
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:04,674
The scanner shows a whole
lot of people heading our way.

503
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,915
Move it out. Clear it.

504
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:35,716
I wouldn't.
Give me an excuse and you're dead.

505
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:54,517
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

506
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:08,996
Earth Alliance Special Transport
is now departing from Docking Bay 6A.

507
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,590
All assigned personnel,
please report immediately.

508
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:20,198
Such great hatred
for so little real reason.

509
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,153
It seems incomprehensible to me.

510
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:26,830
Human ways are often unfathomable.

511
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,474
But one learns to live with them.

512
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:33,474
If one has an exceedingly
strong constitution.

513
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,998
I can't believe you
did this to me, Susan.

514
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:56,113
What kind of a human are you
to side with them?

515
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:00,279
I find many of them are more
human than you and your kind.

516
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,118
You wouldn't understand.

517
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:05,517
- I don't know you anymore.
- I never knew you.

518
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:47,669
