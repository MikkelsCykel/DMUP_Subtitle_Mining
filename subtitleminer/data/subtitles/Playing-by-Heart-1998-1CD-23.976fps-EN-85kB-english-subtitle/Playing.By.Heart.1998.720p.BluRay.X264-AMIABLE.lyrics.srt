1
00:00:02,076 --> 00:00:05,337
I have a friend,
a jazz musician, trumpet player.

2
00:00:05,408 --> 00:00:08,000
Really terrific. And I go
and hear him jam every month or so.

3
00:00:08,076 --> 00:00:11,531
And he plays this piece I love:
an old Chet Baker song.

4
00:00:11,609 --> 00:00:15,905
And he blows the same notes every time,
but every time it sounds different.

5
00:00:15,976 --> 00:00:19,965
And we had drinks one night--
when I used to drink--

6
00:00:20,043 --> 00:00:22,508
and I tried to tell him
how that song made me feel...

7
00:00:22,576 --> 00:00:26,771
how the music made me feel
and how his playing made me feel.

8
00:00:26,844 --> 00:00:29,810
And he just kept shakin'
his head, and he said...

9
00:00:29,877 --> 00:00:31,866
"Joan, you can't talk about music.

10
00:00:31,943 --> 00:00:35,808
Talking about music is like
dancing about architecture."

11
00:00:35,877 --> 00:00:38,570
I just said, "Well, gonna
get all philosophical on me.

12
00:00:38,644 --> 00:00:40,576
It's just as pointless as
talking about a lot of things.

13
00:00:40,644 --> 00:00:42,576
Love, for instance."

14
00:00:42,644 --> 00:00:46,407
And my friend laughed, and he said,
"Definitely. Most definitely.

15
00:00:46,478 --> 00:00:50,171
Talking about love is
like dancing about architecture."

16
00:00:51,777 --> 00:00:55,642
So I don't know.
He might be right.

17
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,869
But it ain't gonna stop me from trying.

18
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:06,373
# Ooh, ah, ooh #

19
00:01:06,446 --> 00:01:11,878
# Ooh, ah, ooh #

20
00:01:11,945 --> 00:01:17,571
# Tell me, tell me
Tell me, tell me #

21
00:01:17,645 --> 00:01:23,102
# Tell me, tell me
Tell me, tell me #

22
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:25,645
# Woke up again this mornin'
with the sun in my eyes #

23
00:01:25,712 --> 00:01:28,678
# We might change the movie script
Surprise #

24
00:01:28,746 --> 00:01:31,473
# A Mafioso story with a twist #

25
00:01:31,546 --> 00:01:33,603
# Two more films
You know, you are a hit #

26
00:01:33,679 --> 00:01:36,804
# You get your ass out there #

27
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:39,210
# All right #

28
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,872
# Feeling nothing #

29
00:01:41,947 --> 00:01:44,469
# Absolutely nothing that day #

30
00:01:44,547 --> 00:01:50,173
# And I say what the hell
am I doing drinking in L.A. #

31
00:01:50,246 --> 00:01:52,940
# How can you sit there #

32
00:02:24,449 --> 00:02:27,244
I'm alone, and I want
to keep it that way.

33
00:02:27,315 --> 00:02:29,906
I lost my wife and son.

34
00:02:29,981 --> 00:02:33,744
- Well, ask the bartender. He can find anything.
- No.

35
00:02:33,816 --> 00:02:35,612
They're dead.

36
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:41,007
Do you wanna talk about it?

37
00:03:10,285 --> 00:03:12,409
Any guys here
taking this Viagra? Let's see.

38
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:14,541
Not one honest guy.

39
00:03:14,617 --> 00:03:17,344
Have you--
Okay?

40
00:03:17,417 --> 00:03:21,180
You know, you have to be--
A friend of mine dropped one of
these Viagra pills on the floor...

41
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,978
and his dog swallowed it.

42
00:03:24,051 --> 00:03:26,574
Now he has a pointer. Anyway--

43
00:03:29,019 --> 00:03:32,610
- We have to talk about this.
- I know. You're right.

44
00:03:35,385 --> 00:03:37,613
But do you really think
we can save this marriage...

45
00:03:37,685 --> 00:03:40,674
now that I've decided I like Leno
better than Letterman?

46
00:03:40,752 --> 00:03:44,082
Don't. I'm sorry.

47
00:03:44,152 --> 00:03:47,084
I remember when my jokes
used to make you laugh.

48
00:03:47,152 --> 00:03:49,084
They do. I just--

49
00:03:54,252 --> 00:03:58,241
- We have to talk about this.
- There's nothing to talk about.

50
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,377
Oh, of course there is.

51
00:04:01,454 --> 00:04:03,386
But I don't want to.

52
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,852
Okay.

53
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,752
What about the party?

54
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,412
Well, nothing's changed.
I have a brain tumor...

55
00:04:16,487 --> 00:04:19,215
but I'm going to that party,
with or without you.

56
00:04:19,288 --> 00:04:21,810
We've put a deposit down.

57
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,553
Mission accomplished.

58
00:04:29,088 --> 00:04:30,145
I am in love.

59
00:04:30,887 --> 00:04:32,376
In love?

60
00:04:32,455 --> 00:04:34,387
Yes, in love.

61
00:04:34,455 --> 00:04:37,888
But before we go further,
let me say this.

62
00:04:37,955 --> 00:04:41,648
Before we go...
further--

63
00:04:41,721 --> 00:04:46,086
I can't go any further.

64
00:04:46,155 --> 00:04:49,917
It's almost 1:00, Meredith. 1:00.

65
00:04:49,988 --> 00:04:53,921
- And I got a day job, remember?
- Yeah. Phil needs his sleep.
He's a postal worker.

66
00:04:53,989 --> 00:04:56,182
All right, slackers.
Trot off home.

67
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,551
Good night.

68
00:04:59,622 --> 00:05:02,486
- Settle a bet I have with Phillip?
- Yeah.

69
00:05:02,556 --> 00:05:05,750
He claims you have
no personal life whatsoever.

70
00:05:05,823 --> 00:05:07,948
I say that's impossible.

71
00:05:08,023 --> 00:05:10,614
I hope it wasn't a large bet.

72
00:05:10,689 --> 00:05:13,588
On equity waiver salary
you can't afford to lose much.

73
00:05:13,657 --> 00:05:15,589
No Mr. Right?

74
00:05:16,723 --> 00:05:19,154
Ms. Right?

75
00:05:19,223 --> 00:05:22,815
No inclination for either at the moment.
Thank you very much.

76
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:26,583
But if you're fishing,
"mister" is my gender of choice.

77
00:05:26,657 --> 00:05:30,055
You're a wonderful person.
You should have someone in your life.

78
00:05:30,124 --> 00:05:32,056
That's all I'm saying.

79
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:36,784
I can still be a wonderful person
and not have anybody in my life.

80
00:05:36,857 --> 00:05:39,846
Look, I'm just not interested
in a relationship right now.

81
00:05:39,924 --> 00:05:41,856
You are such a liar.

82
00:05:43,324 --> 00:05:46,119
I am such a liar.

83
00:05:55,092 --> 00:05:57,683
Front desk.

84
00:05:57,758 --> 00:05:59,690
Hold that, please!

85
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:08,525
Did she not say,
"Hold that, please"?
Or isn't English your first language?

86
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:23,892
Any trouble getting away?

87
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,188
He has his acting class tonight.

88
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:29,919
- You want me to get champagne?
- I don't think I have time for that.

89
00:06:31,793 --> 00:06:34,850
In case you're planning on
being gentle tonight...

90
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,689
don't be.

91
00:07:23,196 --> 00:07:25,128
Mom?

92
00:07:27,362 --> 00:07:29,884
Welcome to Chicago.

93
00:07:31,629 --> 00:07:34,857
You look awful.

94
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:38,726
- You should get some sleep.
- I'll sleep when you sleep.

95
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:49,089
It happened three days ago.

96
00:07:49,163 --> 00:07:53,392
The last time I talked with her--
my wife Leann--

97
00:07:54,564 --> 00:07:56,689
It was about 3:00.

98
00:07:56,764 --> 00:08:00,753
She was taking our son Jamey
to, uh, soccer practice.

99
00:08:03,098 --> 00:08:07,462
Uh, I had a meeting at a bar.

100
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:11,861
I'd had a few drinks. No more
than usual-- standard four-drink buzz.

101
00:08:11,932 --> 00:08:13,864
Maybe five.

102
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:20,428
After, I was gonna meet Leann and Jamey
at the Pizza Hut.

103
00:08:22,198 --> 00:08:24,756
Every Tuesday night
Jamey wants Pizza Hut.

104
00:08:26,498 --> 00:08:28,897
So I was late.

105
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:31,363
I was driving fast.

106
00:08:31,432 --> 00:08:35,057
Not too fast, I think.

107
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:39,531
The light, it just turned.

108
00:08:41,499 --> 00:08:43,431
It was red for only a second.

109
00:08:43,499 --> 00:08:45,523
Less than.
I swear.

110
00:08:48,133 --> 00:08:50,065
I ran the light.

111
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:55,124
I saw the car.

112
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,825
I hit my wife's car.

113
00:08:57,899 --> 00:08:59,831
Oh, my God.

114
00:08:59,899 --> 00:09:03,832
I saw her face through the windshield
just as I hit them.

115
00:09:06,334 --> 00:09:09,323
She saw me.

116
00:09:09,401 --> 00:09:12,060
She knew it was me.

117
00:09:13,267 --> 00:09:15,199
Oh.

118
00:09:16,534 --> 00:09:18,557
You shouldn't be alone.

119
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:21,958
Yes, I should.

120
00:09:22,035 --> 00:09:24,524
I should be alone in hell.

121
00:09:24,601 --> 00:09:26,533
That's where I am.

122
00:09:59,303 --> 00:10:03,759
Twenty minutes at 350 degrees
is absolutely essential.

123
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:05,860
No more, no less.

124
00:10:05,937 --> 00:10:09,562
And the delicacy of this fish
is best appreciated by its taste...

125
00:10:09,636 --> 00:10:12,864
not necessarily by its appearance.

126
00:10:12,937 --> 00:10:14,961
Once you remove the fish
from the oven...

127
00:10:16,971 --> 00:10:20,232
transfer it directly
onto a heated plate.

128
00:10:27,137 --> 00:10:31,468
There's one thing that's
paramount for every cook to keep
in the back of their mind.

129
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:40,232
Only you know
what goes on in the kitchen.

130
00:10:40,305 --> 00:10:43,738
Join me next week:
Hannah's Country Kitchen Cooking.

131
00:10:45,938 --> 00:10:47,870
And we're clear.

132
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:52,429
Hannah, that was incredible!
I smell a fourth Emmy.

133
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:58,602
I don't wanna see any more
of these. Hmm?

134
00:10:58,672 --> 00:11:00,934
Tough. Oh, I--

135
00:11:01,005 --> 00:11:04,403
Mmm. It's delicious.
What?

136
00:11:04,473 --> 00:11:06,870
Nothing.

137
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,528
You can never stop, can you?

138
00:11:14,606 --> 00:11:18,266
- Stop what?
- Organizing things.

139
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:21,794
- Oh, I'll stop if it bothers you.
- No.

140
00:11:21,873 --> 00:11:24,863
It doesn't bother me.
It takes me back.

141
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:30,302
Sit next to me.

142
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,073
It's a hell of a way
for you to find out, huh?

143
00:11:44,141 --> 00:11:47,232
- Find out what?
- Well, that I'm gay, for one.

144
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:51,597
Come on.
You never suspected?

145
00:11:51,675 --> 00:11:55,573
- You were always so good at sports.
- Mom!

146
00:11:55,641 --> 00:12:00,096
I'm really glad you're here.

147
00:12:01,609 --> 00:12:04,905
- And what's the second thing?
- What second thing?

148
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:09,237
You said it was a hell of a way
for me to find out that you
were gay for "one" thing.

149
00:12:09,309 --> 00:12:11,741
- So what's the second thing?
- That I'm dying.

150
00:12:11,809 --> 00:12:15,605
- Don't say that!
- Oh, stop! I can't go back into
our classic mother-son pattern.

151
00:12:15,676 --> 00:12:20,768
Okay? I can't play the Iverson family
game of denying reality...

152
00:12:20,843 --> 00:12:23,435
- where reality is over there, somewhere...
- Oh, honey, don't.

153
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:26,805
and we hide from it over here
and pretend it doesn't exist.

154
00:12:26,876 --> 00:12:30,706
Okay? It takes too much energy.
Energy that I don't have.

155
00:12:30,776 --> 00:12:32,969
All right. Maybe I don't either...
have the energy.

156
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:35,032
God, that would be good.

157
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:37,577
All right, we'll start fresh.

158
00:12:37,643 --> 00:12:39,575
Pattern-free.

159
00:12:39,643 --> 00:12:43,803
Within these four walls,
reality will prevail.

160
00:12:43,877 --> 00:12:47,173
And if I slip up,
you-- you let me know.

161
00:12:47,244 --> 00:12:49,142
You'll--
You'll be the first.

162
00:12:53,244 --> 00:12:56,540
They say first steps
are the hardest.

163
00:13:02,578 --> 00:13:05,635
The doctor said
you haven't had any visitors.

164
00:13:05,711 --> 00:13:10,507
You know me, Mom. I've never been
one to have a lot of friends.

165
00:13:10,578 --> 00:13:14,568
Besides, I seem to be
the last of my small crowd.

166
00:13:14,645 --> 00:13:16,702
What about your roommate Jack?

167
00:13:19,046 --> 00:13:23,239
He wasn't my roommate, Mother,
and he died a year ago.

168
00:13:28,112 --> 00:13:30,079
Hey, how's the commercial going?

169
00:13:30,146 --> 00:13:32,078
It's on hold for a week.

170
00:13:32,146 --> 00:13:36,704
The geniuses at Pacific Motors
have now decided to spotlight the car...

171
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,712
and dumb down the concept.

172
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:43,439
- No Fellini?
- Who? Most definitely no Fellini.

173
00:13:43,513 --> 00:13:46,172
But my play's not falling apart.

174
00:13:46,246 --> 00:13:48,270
- I'm happy for you.
- Thank you.

175
00:13:48,347 --> 00:13:50,438
Bosco, where do you keep
Theater Week?

176
00:13:50,514 --> 00:13:54,537
Top shelf. Between Psychology Today
and Martha Stewart Living.

177
00:13:57,247 --> 00:13:59,179
Uh-oh!
Whoa!

178
00:13:59,247 --> 00:14:02,338
Jesus! Meredith?

179
00:14:02,414 --> 00:14:05,404
Jimmy, grab that side! Grab that side.
Okay. Everyone. All right, fellas.

180
00:14:05,482 --> 00:14:09,073
On three. One--
Oh. Okay. All right.

181
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:11,807
- Can we say "lawsuit"?
- Uh, are you okay?

182
00:14:11,881 --> 00:14:14,904
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Fine.
I landed on a stack of George.

183
00:14:14,981 --> 00:14:18,072
- Plenty of padding.
- Meet the architect.

184
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:22,274
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Thank you.

185
00:14:22,348 --> 00:14:25,837
- If I can just find one, Theater Week is on me.
- And dinner is on me.

186
00:14:25,915 --> 00:14:29,870
- No, no. Not necessary. Truly.
- Please. I insist.
It's the least I can do. I mean--

187
00:14:29,949 --> 00:14:33,313
- Look, I'm not gonna sue you, okay?
- I didn't think you were gonna sue me.

188
00:14:35,782 --> 00:14:38,543
Not that I couldn't, mind you.
But something tells me...

189
00:14:38,615 --> 00:14:41,878
that you'd be able to convince
the jury that this was my fault.

190
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:46,746
You know I'm not just asking you
to dinner as a preemptive strike
against litigation.

191
00:14:46,816 --> 00:14:49,304
- I'm asking because--
- I'll have dinner with you.

192
00:14:50,983 --> 00:14:54,210
- What changed your mind?
- Anybody who can say "preemptive strike...

193
00:14:54,282 --> 00:14:57,373
against litigation" with a straight face
deserves a dinner companion.

194
00:14:57,449 --> 00:15:00,280
Thank you.

195
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:02,973
This is last week's.

196
00:15:03,117 --> 00:15:06,811
I'm thinking of putting
the show on hiatus.

197
00:15:06,884 --> 00:15:09,475
And I'm thinking
you'll do no such thing.

198
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:14,881
- But, Paul--
- No. I don't want anything to be any different.

199
00:15:14,951 --> 00:15:18,679
- Things are different.
- I don't want to have a fight with you.

200
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:21,944
I don't want a fight. I just--
I just want to talk and make--

201
00:15:22,017 --> 00:15:26,347
Look. What about what I want?
You've always controlled everything:

202
00:15:26,418 --> 00:15:28,407
your shows, the kids.

203
00:15:28,485 --> 00:15:31,212
Stop trying to control me.

204
00:15:31,284 --> 00:15:33,273
I'm not trying
to control anybody.

205
00:15:33,351 --> 00:15:36,147
- I just think maybe--
- Don't think.

206
00:15:36,219 --> 00:15:40,015
Let us just proceed as if
nothing has changed. All right?

207
00:15:44,219 --> 00:15:48,276
- I don't know if I can do that.
- You have no choice.

208
00:15:50,185 --> 00:15:53,448
I may have just enough time left
to become an alcoholic.

209
00:16:00,153 --> 00:16:15,078
#

210
00:16:27,255 --> 00:16:30,846
I don't care who had her first. I poke
around her stool looking for worms.

211
00:16:30,921 --> 00:16:32,978
I feed the fucking thing.
I take her to the vet.

212
00:16:33,055 --> 00:16:35,180
All you do is pet her twice a day.

213
00:16:35,254 --> 00:16:38,153
Which is a hell of a lot more
than you've been doing to me lately.

214
00:16:38,221 --> 00:16:40,380
Okay, let's discuss this calmly.

215
00:16:40,454 --> 00:16:44,216
We're adults.
We've been together a long time.

216
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,652
Well, not a long time,
but an adequate four months.

217
00:16:46,722 --> 00:16:50,586
Adequate until you fuckin' cheated on me
with that skag from Bloomingdale's!

218
00:16:50,655 --> 00:16:52,587
You fu--
Harry?

219
00:16:52,655 --> 00:16:56,314
Don't you dare hang up.
Harry! Harry?

220
00:16:57,589 --> 00:17:00,077
Shit! Shit.

221
00:17:07,423 --> 00:17:10,014
Hi. You got a quarter?

222
00:17:14,623 --> 00:17:16,555
Thank you.

223
00:17:22,023 --> 00:17:23,955
The fucking cat is mine.

224
00:17:25,124 --> 00:17:27,919
No, no.
On this I'm not negotiable, Harry.

225
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:30,922
Harry. Hey! Hey!
Don't be a fuckin' infant, okay?

226
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:34,945
You can take anything that came from IKEA.
I want the cat, and I want Pottery Barn.

227
00:17:35,023 --> 00:17:37,455
It--
One more time.

228
00:17:37,524 --> 00:17:40,423
You hang up one more time and I--

229
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:42,424
Damn it.

230
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:48,649
- It's my last one.
- Negotiations are almost over.

231
00:17:50,691 --> 00:17:52,623
Thank you.

232
00:17:56,859 --> 00:18:00,189
All right. Okay, scumbag.
You're robbing me blind...

233
00:18:00,259 --> 00:18:04,055
but I will give up Pottery Barn
if I can just have the cat.

234
00:18:05,558 --> 00:18:08,922
No! No. Pottery Barn does not
include Williams Sonoma.

235
00:18:08,992 --> 00:18:12,186
They're two separate
establishments, Harry.

236
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:14,691
Oh, Christ on crutches!
Okay, you know what, Harry?

237
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:18,714
I want to get rid of you as much as I
want to get rid of that junk from IKEA.

238
00:18:18,793 --> 00:18:21,224
So here's the thing.

239
00:18:21,292 --> 00:18:25,281
You can walk away with Pottery Barn,
Williams Sonoma, IKEA.

240
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:30,223
And just to show you that I'm
a grown-up, I will throw in all
the crap from Hold Everything!

241
00:18:30,292 --> 00:18:33,088
Yeah! Yeah, that includes
the hanging shoe sorter.

242
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:37,024
That's right.
Do we have a deal? Great.

243
00:18:37,093 --> 00:18:40,184
So here's the thing.
I will be home in two hours.

244
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:43,590
You and all your junk
from the catalogs will be gone...

245
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:46,285
and the cat will be there waiting
for me, purring contentedly.

246
00:18:50,294 --> 00:18:54,420
Well, the least I can do
after taking your last quarter
is let you buy me a drink.

247
00:19:07,261 --> 00:19:10,285
I work in the Twin Towers.
Entertainment law.

248
00:19:12,395 --> 00:19:14,792
- And you?
- Me?

249
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:16,987
I'm not very good company.
I'm-- I'm sorry.

250
00:19:19,362 --> 00:19:21,294
No problem.

251
00:19:24,828 --> 00:19:27,954
- I'm not gonna bother you.
- Uh, don't go. l-l-I'm sorry.

252
00:19:28,029 --> 00:19:30,961
- No, I'm sorry. Really.
- Again, I'm sorry.

253
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:36,525
- You've had a bad day.
- A killer.

254
00:19:36,596 --> 00:19:40,858
You know, yesterday I would have
said that things couldn't
possibly get any worse.

255
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:43,361
They sure as hell
got worse today.

256
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:48,760
I'm, uh--
I work in the, uh, Twin Towers too.

257
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:52,318
I'm a development executive
over at ABC.

258
00:19:52,396 --> 00:19:56,158
I'm responsible for all those shit shows
that you don't watch on Thursday night.

259
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:58,594
You're to blame for those?

260
00:19:58,663 --> 00:20:01,028
Afraid so.

261
00:20:01,098 --> 00:20:03,030
Everybody blames me.

262
00:20:03,097 --> 00:20:07,052
My boss, my wife, my secretary.

263
00:20:07,131 --> 00:20:09,063
Hell, even my kids.
They watch NBC.

264
00:20:09,131 --> 00:20:12,859
And I work like a dog...

265
00:20:12,931 --> 00:20:16,624
trying to find some way to fix
the Thursday night schedule.

266
00:20:20,532 --> 00:20:23,259
Well, I don't find a way to fix
the Thursday night schedule...

267
00:20:23,332 --> 00:20:25,457
and my boss,
today he tells me...

268
00:20:25,532 --> 00:20:29,430
that coming into the office
tomorrow isn't necessary.

269
00:20:29,499 --> 00:20:34,227
Or coming in ever again,
for that matter.

270
00:20:36,065 --> 00:20:39,555
I wish you could
spend the night.

271
00:20:39,633 --> 00:20:41,565
You know I can't.

272
00:20:42,999 --> 00:20:45,124
- Is this all you want from us?
- Roger...

273
00:20:45,199 --> 00:20:48,722
and I mean this really sweetly,
there isn't any us.

274
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:52,595
- Mmm. There's only this.
- Well, this could be different.

275
00:20:52,665 --> 00:20:54,791
Well, anything
can be different.

276
00:20:54,867 --> 00:20:57,026
But I don't want this to be.

277
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:01,964
I want it to be what it is:
two very sexually compatible
people enjoying each other...

278
00:21:02,033 --> 00:21:05,431
with no obligations,
no complications...

279
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,796
no individual history,
no mutual history...

280
00:21:07,867 --> 00:21:10,299
and no guilt.

281
00:21:10,367 --> 00:21:12,856
- That's awfully cold.
- It's awfully realistic.

282
00:21:12,934 --> 00:21:15,957
- I know you don't love your husband.
- Oh, but I know...

283
00:21:16,034 --> 00:21:18,659
that you do love your wife.

284
00:21:23,567 --> 00:21:25,999
I'll have a vodka martini,
very dry and straight up...

285
00:21:26,068 --> 00:21:31,092
- with three olives, and my sullen friend here will have--
- A Coke.

286
00:21:31,169 --> 00:21:34,794
The poster boy for designated drivers
will have a Coke.

287
00:21:37,069 --> 00:21:39,728
- The guy on the phone?
- Harry.

288
00:21:39,802 --> 00:21:42,290
Harry, right.
We were together for five months.

289
00:21:42,368 --> 00:21:44,926
- I thought it was four.
- You were paying attention.

290
00:21:45,002 --> 00:21:47,263
Everyone in this club
was paying attention.

291
00:21:47,335 --> 00:21:49,768
We were together for five months.
But I knew it wasn't gonna work out...

292
00:21:49,836 --> 00:21:53,393
'cause the first time he comes over
I find out that he sits down to pee.

293
00:21:53,469 --> 00:21:56,924
- You don't do that, do you?
- No.

294
00:21:57,002 --> 00:21:58,968
So fuckin' lazy.
And in my experience...

295
00:21:59,035 --> 00:22:02,661
it extends to other aspects
of an individual's personality.

296
00:22:02,736 --> 00:22:07,567
Last time I saw him, Harry was wearing a
blue sweater and an idiotic expression.

297
00:22:07,637 --> 00:22:10,034
The sweater was new.

298
00:22:10,103 --> 00:22:12,262
Here's to good riddance Harry.

299
00:22:13,337 --> 00:22:15,269
Good riddance Harry.

300
00:22:24,571 --> 00:22:27,435
Hey, again please.

301
00:22:27,505 --> 00:22:30,664
And drier this time,
and three olives, not two.

302
00:22:30,737 --> 00:22:33,169
Three.
Nutritional value.

303
00:22:33,238 --> 00:22:35,227
Now, where were we?
Oh, so Harry.

304
00:22:35,304 --> 00:22:37,633
Right.

305
00:22:37,704 --> 00:22:39,761
The sex part wasn't bad.

306
00:22:39,837 --> 00:22:41,770
You know, for a while.

307
00:22:41,838 --> 00:22:46,930
And then his consummate laziness
and lack of imagination
became tediously self-evident.

308
00:22:47,005 --> 00:22:51,994
Every time, everything was
exactly the same as the time previous.

309
00:22:52,072 --> 00:22:56,367
It was as if he had followed
some step-by-step instructional video.

310
00:22:56,438 --> 00:22:59,928
And about two weeks ago,
guess what I found in the apartment.

311
00:23:00,006 --> 00:23:04,995
- A step-by-step instructional video.
- Right! Here's the topper.

312
00:23:05,073 --> 00:23:08,130
I timed his performance
one night. Right?

313
00:23:08,205 --> 00:23:11,569
And then I checked the running time
on the video. And guess what.

314
00:23:11,639 --> 00:23:14,230
- To the minute.
- Right down to it.

315
00:23:14,305 --> 00:23:16,237
Twenty-three minutes, to be exact.

316
00:23:16,305 --> 00:23:18,238
Including credits.

317
00:23:19,306 --> 00:23:22,864
Anyway, he's history.

318
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:26,030
- But I still have Blanche.
- Who would be the cat.

319
00:23:26,106 --> 00:23:28,595
Oh, a great cat.
Very feline.

320
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:30,764
The best cats are.

321
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:34,398
Blanche can look at you with a gaze
of unflappable superiority...

322
00:23:34,474 --> 00:23:38,873
that seems to spring from near total
detachment and disinterest.

323
00:23:40,307 --> 00:23:43,068
Not unlike
how you're looking at me now.

324
00:23:47,274 --> 00:23:49,206
Thank you.

325
00:23:51,141 --> 00:23:53,869
You don't say very much, do you?

326
00:23:53,941 --> 00:23:57,873
- Does anyone, when they're with you?
- Don't get mean.

327
00:23:59,908 --> 00:24:03,965
We don't know each other well enough
yet. When we do, then you can get mean.

328
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:09,137
So we should do this again sometime.

329
00:24:09,208 --> 00:24:12,663
- We're not doing anything.
- Okay. Then let's not do this.

330
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:15,368
Let's do something else.

331
00:24:15,443 --> 00:24:17,738
I'll even let you be the man.
You can decide where we go on our date.

332
00:24:19,976 --> 00:24:22,806
I don't date.

333
00:24:22,876 --> 00:24:26,638
Well. Gee, I don't have
a witty comeback for that one.

334
00:24:26,709 --> 00:24:28,972
I mean, I'm used to
any number of brush-offs...

335
00:24:29,043 --> 00:24:31,508
but that's, uh, that's a new one.

336
00:24:31,576 --> 00:24:34,542
Doesn't date.

337
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:38,065
I'll admit I've seen you around. You're
always-- You're always dancing alone.

338
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:42,740
- That's the way I like it.
- Why is that?

339
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:47,338
I don't want to be
rude or unkind...

340
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:49,842
or... mean.

341
00:24:52,111 --> 00:24:55,406
But I just don't come out with my entire
life story over martinis and a Coke.

342
00:24:59,144 --> 00:25:01,542
I'm sorry, really.

343
00:25:01,611 --> 00:25:04,134
Your cat's lucky to have you.

344
00:25:12,211 --> 00:25:15,644
My wife had moved them out.

345
00:25:15,712 --> 00:25:18,507
Moved everything out.
Left a note.

346
00:25:18,578 --> 00:25:20,907
Very thoughtful.
Didn't realize she felt that way.

347
00:25:20,978 --> 00:25:22,809
What way?

348
00:25:26,613 --> 00:25:29,078
That I was a failure.

349
00:25:29,146 --> 00:25:32,942
Not only professionally,
but personally as well.

350
00:25:33,012 --> 00:25:36,842
Just like ABC no longer required
my services. She let me know...

351
00:25:36,912 --> 00:25:42,346
that she and the kids no longer
required my services or my presence.

352
00:25:42,413 --> 00:25:46,505
It turns out she's been
seeing some guy for a year...

353
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:49,704
for a fucking year,
and I never suspected a thing.

354
00:25:49,779 --> 00:25:52,075
- And you know what the worst of it is?
- What?

355
00:25:52,147 --> 00:25:54,942
The guy that she left me for?
The fucker works for NBC!

356
00:25:55,013 --> 00:25:58,447
He's got my wife and my kids,
my cat and my dog...

357
00:25:58,514 --> 00:26:02,277
and he doesn't have to lose
any sleep over the Thursday
night fucking schedule!

358
00:26:10,647 --> 00:26:12,875
Honey?

359
00:26:12,947 --> 00:26:16,812
You should come to bed.
What are you working on so late?

360
00:26:16,882 --> 00:26:19,212
I was just checking on
your TV residuals.

361
00:26:19,281 --> 00:26:21,679
They're still robbing us blind.

362
00:26:21,748 --> 00:26:24,839
I happen to know you're
a tremendous hit on WWFU.

363
00:26:24,915 --> 00:26:26,608
Which is where?

364
00:26:26,681 --> 00:26:28,840
Intercourse, Pennsylvania.

365
00:26:28,915 --> 00:26:31,437
Oh, Intercourse.

366
00:26:31,515 --> 00:26:33,982
And they can't get enough
of you in Intercourse.

367
00:26:34,049 --> 00:26:35,981
And I know exactly
how they feel.

368
00:26:37,916 --> 00:26:40,643
Bed.

369
00:26:42,082 --> 00:26:44,810
Come on, Molly. Come on, Crackers.

370
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:56,373
There you are, sir. Okay?

371
00:26:56,450 --> 00:27:00,678
- Cheers.
- I've been meaning to ask you about your wedding ring.

372
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:07,148
It's really just force
of habit. I, uh...

373
00:27:07,216 --> 00:27:11,445
divorced...
four chilling years ago.

374
00:27:12,518 --> 00:27:15,245
- Acrimonious?
- No.

375
00:27:15,317 --> 00:27:18,511
Oh, wait, that means
hostile and bitter. Yes.

376
00:27:18,584 --> 00:27:22,448
In the divorce papers she referred to me
as the "architect of her misfortune."

377
00:27:23,551 --> 00:27:27,177
- Ouch.
- Yeah. No kids, luckily.

378
00:27:27,252 --> 00:27:31,843
I wanted them,
but she didn't.

379
00:27:31,918 --> 00:27:33,850
- You know, if this makes you uncomfortable--
- No.

380
00:27:33,918 --> 00:27:36,248
- I can take it off, the ring. It's not a problem.
- No, no. Stop.

381
00:27:36,318 --> 00:27:40,773
Don't be silly.
That would be two of us being silly.

382
00:27:40,851 --> 00:27:44,875
I really only wear it to keep
the construction guys from harassing me.

383
00:27:46,153 --> 00:27:48,846
Does it work?

384
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:51,976
Depends on what I'm wearing.

385
00:27:54,519 --> 00:27:58,576
I think you can tell
that I'm not very good at this.

386
00:28:01,253 --> 00:28:04,481
You're charming.

387
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:09,447
And real.

388
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,986
Lovely.

389
00:28:12,053 --> 00:28:14,348
What did I say?

390
00:28:14,419 --> 00:28:16,476
Nothing.

391
00:28:16,553 --> 00:28:18,542
No, no. Nothing.

392
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:21,712
I just, um--

393
00:28:21,787 --> 00:28:26,913
Before I came here tonight,
I was discussing you with my sister.

394
00:28:26,987 --> 00:28:30,476
We were coming up with
a psychological profile.

395
00:28:30,554 --> 00:28:32,486
Several, actually.

396
00:28:32,554 --> 00:28:36,418
- And which did I fit into?
- Oh, none.

397
00:28:36,487 --> 00:28:39,682
I think I'm gonna have to
revise the filing system.

398
00:28:39,755 --> 00:28:43,710
Put you in
the "too good to be true" category.

399
00:28:43,788 --> 00:28:47,720
Mmm.
But not to worry.

400
00:28:47,787 --> 00:28:50,618
I just know you'll turn out
to be involved with somebody else...

401
00:28:50,688 --> 00:28:54,211
or... gay or crazy.

402
00:28:58,489 --> 00:29:01,455
Well, it's a definite possibility.

403
00:29:04,222 --> 00:29:06,154
Crazy, huh?

404
00:29:07,322 --> 00:29:09,254
Certifiable.

405
00:29:13,123 --> 00:29:15,055
Mom.

406
00:29:16,489 --> 00:29:19,047
I know you've spoken to my doctor.

407
00:29:19,123 --> 00:29:22,248
I know. I know he told you
I don't have long...

408
00:29:22,323 --> 00:29:24,788
so let's not pretend
that I do, okay?

409
00:29:26,923 --> 00:29:28,855
Want to watch another movie?

410
00:29:28,923 --> 00:29:31,481
No. God, no.

411
00:29:33,457 --> 00:29:36,912
I tell you what I would like,
is I'd like to play a game.

412
00:29:36,991 --> 00:29:42,117
- Should I get a deck of cards?
- No. Not that kind of game.

413
00:29:42,191 --> 00:29:46,021
- What?
- I want each of us to take some time...

414
00:29:46,091 --> 00:29:50,285
and think of something that we have
always wanted to tell the other.

415
00:29:51,358 --> 00:29:54,052
Something private, some secret...

416
00:29:54,124 --> 00:29:56,522
some feeling or memory.

417
00:29:56,591 --> 00:30:00,148
It could be anything.
Just as long as it's truthful.

418
00:30:00,224 --> 00:30:03,520
Uh, I don't know
if I'd be good at that kind of game.

419
00:30:03,591 --> 00:30:05,489
Will you try for me?

420
00:30:12,025 --> 00:30:13,957
Um--

421
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,490
I'm waiting.

422
00:30:30,126 --> 00:30:32,592
I never loved your father.

423
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:34,592
Not for a minute.

424
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:39,255
Wow. You're good at this.

425
00:30:43,161 --> 00:30:46,252
- Why did you marry him?
- Oh.

426
00:30:46,327 --> 00:30:48,350
I was pushing 30.

427
00:30:48,427 --> 00:30:52,291
Back then we called that
a last chance for happiness.

428
00:30:52,361 --> 00:30:55,849
He had a good business.
I remember my mother saying, "Marry him.

429
00:30:55,927 --> 00:30:58,018
He's an undertaker
and will never be out of work.

430
00:30:58,094 --> 00:30:59,993
People will always--"

431
00:31:01,995 --> 00:31:03,927
People will always die.

432
00:31:07,661 --> 00:31:09,593
People will always die.

433
00:31:17,829 --> 00:31:20,886
I hope it's okay for me
to say this, but...

434
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:24,325
you strike me
as someone who's been...

435
00:31:24,395 --> 00:31:26,793
burned romantically.

436
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:30,553
Scalded.

437
00:31:30,629 --> 00:31:33,322
Repeatedly.

438
00:31:33,395 --> 00:31:36,624
Married?

439
00:31:36,696 --> 00:31:39,958
- Divorced?
- Yes.

440
00:31:40,029 --> 00:31:42,154
But that was a long time ago...

441
00:31:42,229 --> 00:31:44,491
and, believe it or not,
one of my better experiences.

442
00:31:44,563 --> 00:31:46,495
Let me guess.

443
00:31:46,563 --> 00:31:49,723
Uh, he was either involved
with somebody else...

444
00:31:49,796 --> 00:31:51,920
or gay...

445
00:31:51,996 --> 00:31:53,929
or crazy.

446
00:31:53,997 --> 00:31:55,929
Actually, yes.

447
00:31:57,664 --> 00:32:00,323
Involved with someone else?

448
00:32:00,397 --> 00:32:04,124
- Crazy?
- No. He was gay.

449
00:32:04,197 --> 00:32:06,459
- Wow. Really?
- Yeah.

450
00:32:06,531 --> 00:32:09,258
- I mean, I'm sorry.
- No.

451
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:11,524
I mean, I'm not sorry. I mean, uh--

452
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:15,920
- Save me.
- It's okay.

453
00:32:15,998 --> 00:32:18,556
He was a great guy.

454
00:32:18,631 --> 00:32:22,587
I married the boy next door.
Literally. We were 19.

455
00:32:22,664 --> 00:32:25,630
It didn't last very long.
Couldn't, of course.

456
00:32:27,331 --> 00:32:31,059
I haven't seen him in a long time,
but, uh, but we're still friends.

457
00:32:31,132 --> 00:32:35,428
Which is more than I can say for the
parade of total losers that followed.

458
00:32:35,498 --> 00:32:40,090
Are there any, uh,
recent or current losers?

459
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:42,155
No.

460
00:32:42,232 --> 00:32:46,256
I've been in a holding pattern
where romance is concerned.

461
00:32:46,333 --> 00:32:49,856
- Well, things can change quickly.
- Yeah.

462
00:32:54,432 --> 00:32:57,523
I'm sorry.

463
00:32:57,599 --> 00:33:01,656
This is, uh, going
a little too quickly for me.

464
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:05,532
I can go slow.

465
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,632
Look, Trent,
you're a nice guy. I--

466
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:12,792
- Aw! Aw. That's-- You know?
- What?

467
00:33:12,867 --> 00:33:15,298
- I'm swimming ashore. You can call the Coast Guard.
- Oh, come on.

468
00:33:15,367 --> 00:33:17,765
"Nice guy"? That's--

469
00:33:17,834 --> 00:33:22,199
I haven't been dismissed
with that since high school.

470
00:33:22,268 --> 00:33:24,757
Does that mean no second date?

471
00:33:24,835 --> 00:33:27,164
I have a hard time trusting men.

472
00:33:27,234 --> 00:33:31,064
I'm not men.
I'm not a group. Just me.

473
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:34,699
Who probably has
a lot of women after him.

474
00:33:34,768 --> 00:33:37,961
- So?
- So--

475
00:33:38,034 --> 00:33:40,627
Look, you know,
you seem to want honesty...

476
00:33:40,702 --> 00:33:42,634
so I'll be honest with you.

477
00:33:42,702 --> 00:33:44,860
I don't really have
a problem getting dates.

478
00:33:44,935 --> 00:33:48,459
But I'm 38 years old.
I don't just want dates anymore.

479
00:33:48,536 --> 00:33:51,001
I'll tell you what I don't want.

480
00:33:51,068 --> 00:33:54,432
I don't want all of
this calculated artificiality.

481
00:33:54,502 --> 00:33:59,595
This isn't me, Trent--
this dress, the stupid little bows
in my hair. And look at you.

482
00:33:59,669 --> 00:34:03,658
I mean, I don't imagine you sit around
your house in an Armani suit. Do you?

483
00:34:03,736 --> 00:34:07,134
No. My house is black-tie.

484
00:34:13,602 --> 00:34:16,126
- Look, I'm sorry, but--
- I know, you have to go.

485
00:34:16,204 --> 00:34:19,567
- I'm already-- Jesus-- two hours late.
- You're leavin' me too.

486
00:34:19,637 --> 00:34:22,432
It's okay. Really.
Just go. Go.

487
00:34:22,503 --> 00:34:26,663
- Until the day I die, I'll remember that story.
- Yeah, listen. Listen.

488
00:34:26,737 --> 00:34:30,829
You have been swell,
listening to me like this.

489
00:34:30,904 --> 00:34:35,428
Bet you'll think twice about striking up
a conversation in this bar again, huh?

490
00:34:35,504 --> 00:34:37,868
Take care. All right?

491
00:34:37,938 --> 00:34:40,403
- For once I really, really mean that.
- Yeah.

492
00:34:40,471 --> 00:34:42,835
- Good-bye.
- Bye.

493
00:34:48,638 --> 00:34:50,571
Taxi money.

494
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:53,104
Don't even think of allowing
that guy to drive.

495
00:34:53,172 --> 00:34:55,866
I'm a lawyer.
I'll hunt you down.

496
00:35:02,405 --> 00:35:04,701
Look, Trent...

497
00:35:04,772 --> 00:35:08,067
if by some miracle,
after this explosion of neuroses...

498
00:35:08,138 --> 00:35:10,537
you still want to see me,
we can start from the top.

499
00:35:10,606 --> 00:35:13,037
You can cook dinner
for me Tuesday.

500
00:35:14,273 --> 00:35:16,705
- Okay.
- Good.

501
00:35:17,906 --> 00:35:20,338
- Tuesday.
- Yeah.

502
00:35:20,406 --> 00:35:23,566
- You can come to my apartment.
- Okay.

503
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:26,800
Meet my better half.

504
00:35:26,873 --> 00:35:31,272
- Better half?
- Yeah. My dog. Barley.

505
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:34,067
Your dog Barley? That'd be great.
I'd love to meet Barley.

506
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:36,072
- Good.
- I'll bring the wine.

507
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:38,265
- Great.
- Good.

508
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,931
- Tuesday night.
- Absolutely.

509
00:35:41,007 --> 00:35:44,770
You know, Meredith,
those stupid little bows?

510
00:35:45,841 --> 00:35:47,773
I think they're adorable.

511
00:37:05,611 --> 00:37:08,577
Why did you stay with him?

512
00:37:08,645 --> 00:37:11,906
Well, you.

513
00:37:11,977 --> 00:37:16,138
I guess I was the last generation
of women who actually did that.

514
00:37:16,212 --> 00:37:19,974
It never even occurred to me
to get a divorce.

515
00:37:20,045 --> 00:37:24,068
I was so relieved when he died.

516
00:37:24,145 --> 00:37:29,476
- Don't hold anything back, Mom.
- Mmm.

517
00:37:29,545 --> 00:37:33,501
Ah, I like this
new spirit of frankness.

518
00:37:33,579 --> 00:37:36,137
It's oddly cleansing.

519
00:37:46,979 --> 00:37:49,639
I want to know
what you're like away from me here.

520
00:37:49,713 --> 00:37:53,873
That can't happen. The fact that you and
I aren't involved beyond this room...

521
00:37:53,947 --> 00:37:56,276
is what-- ahh-- appeals to me.

522
00:37:56,346 --> 00:38:00,335
You know how to play
your role damn well.

523
00:38:00,413 --> 00:38:03,107
Guilty as charged.

524
00:38:11,848 --> 00:38:16,109
- Roger, what do you want?
- I don't want much.

525
00:38:16,181 --> 00:38:19,306
I just want more of you.

526
00:38:21,347 --> 00:38:23,279
I can't give you that.

527
00:38:25,882 --> 00:38:29,507
Roger.
Don't be an anger ball.

528
00:38:29,582 --> 00:38:31,514
"An anger ball"?

529
00:38:33,115 --> 00:38:36,513
Don't you see?
What's great about you and me...

530
00:38:36,582 --> 00:38:41,412
right here, this very moment,
is that we don't come through
that door with a lot of baggage.

531
00:38:41,482 --> 00:38:45,245
We don't come through that door
with any baggage at all.

532
00:38:45,316 --> 00:38:49,271
And aren't we lucky?
We don't bring anything in...

533
00:38:49,349 --> 00:38:52,644
and we don't take anything out.

534
00:38:58,449 --> 00:39:08,213
#

535
00:39:08,284 --> 00:39:10,977
You're not the only one
who can dance alone.

536
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:14,982
- What?
- I said you look like a man in need of a Coke.

537
00:39:19,151 --> 00:39:21,844
#

538
00:39:24,684 --> 00:39:27,980
Uh, my friend here will have a Coke,
and I'll have a--

539
00:39:28,051 --> 00:39:31,744
Vodka martini,
very dry, three olives.

540
00:39:31,817 --> 00:39:33,749
Good memory.

541
00:39:33,817 --> 00:39:36,978
My mind has an endless capacity
for useless information.

542
00:39:39,485 --> 00:39:42,144
I've had a terrible day.

543
00:39:42,218 --> 00:39:45,582
I know we were talking about you for
a moment there, but my day was so bad.

544
00:39:45,652 --> 00:39:48,117
"How bad was it?" you might ask.

545
00:39:48,185 --> 00:39:51,208
- I might if you gave me the opportunity.
- I was saving you the effort...

546
00:39:51,285 --> 00:39:54,218
so that after I tell you my tale of woe
we can move on to happier topics.

547
00:39:54,286 --> 00:39:58,048
Perhaps one of your choosing. Anyway,
I'm an actress. Did I tell you that?

548
00:39:58,119 --> 00:40:02,484
- No. But I'm not surprised.
- I had this monologue in class today.

549
00:40:02,553 --> 00:40:06,212
And I was prepared.
You know, I mean, like really prepared.

550
00:40:06,286 --> 00:40:08,616
You know Suddenly Last Summer
by Tennessee Williams?

551
00:40:08,686 --> 00:40:12,312
- No.
- Oh, it's one of my favorites. Great story.

552
00:40:12,387 --> 00:40:15,080
It's about this girl, Katherine-- moi--

553
00:40:15,153 --> 00:40:18,880
who is slated for a lobotomy
because the mother of her cousin
wants to keep her mouth shut...

554
00:40:18,953 --> 00:40:22,351
about certain goings-on involving
the old lady's son Sebastian.

555
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:26,546
You see, the women sort of pimp
for Cousin Sebastian.
Are you following this?

556
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:28,415
- Amazingly, yes.
- Anyway, it turns out...

557
00:40:28,487 --> 00:40:32,580
on their travels together Cousin
Sebastian liked to troll the beaches...

558
00:40:32,654 --> 00:40:37,110
looking for young native boys
in order to satisfy his base instincts.

559
00:40:37,188 --> 00:40:39,915
One hot afternoon in Cartagena...

560
00:40:39,987 --> 00:40:43,646
the boys decide they have had quite
enough of Sebastian's shenanigans...

561
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:47,154
and they--
well, they eat him.

562
00:40:47,222 --> 00:40:50,745
- You mean metaphorically.
- No. They really eat him.

563
00:40:50,821 --> 00:40:55,480
They devour him.
In short, he's lunch.

564
00:40:55,555 --> 00:40:58,419
And Katherine witnesses
every course...

565
00:40:58,488 --> 00:41:00,818
from soup to nuts.

566
00:41:00,888 --> 00:41:03,116
If you'll pardon the expression.

567
00:41:03,189 --> 00:41:06,713
Anyway, I'm about to do
this killer monologue. I'm up next--

568
00:41:06,789 --> 00:41:10,346
If one more actor saunters
into this class...

569
00:41:10,422 --> 00:41:15,218
and recites Katherine's "native boys
ate my cousin Sebastian" speech...

570
00:41:15,289 --> 00:41:17,482
from Suddenly Last Summer...

571
00:41:17,556 --> 00:41:20,420
I am going to puke.

572
00:41:20,489 --> 00:41:23,854
Now, who is up next?

573
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:29,179
Um... Joan! You're on.

574
00:41:30,657 --> 00:41:34,316
The teacher didn't lose
his lunch. I did.

575
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:38,151
- I'm sorry.
- So am I.

576
00:41:41,024 --> 00:41:45,184
Now, on to happier topics, I promise.
How about a movie?

577
00:41:45,257 --> 00:41:47,086
- I told you.
- I know.

578
00:41:47,157 --> 00:41:49,987
I know. You don't date.
Is it a religious thing?

579
00:41:50,057 --> 00:41:54,114
- No.
- Well, you like movies, don't you?

580
00:41:54,191 --> 00:41:56,123
- They're okay.
- How about tomorrow night?

581
00:41:56,191 --> 00:41:58,987
It doesn't have to be a date.
We'll meet at the theater.

582
00:42:00,692 --> 00:42:04,317
- I don't know.
- Look. I'll make it easy. Okay, blue boy?

583
00:42:04,392 --> 00:42:08,222
Tomorrow night I'm going to the
late show of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre
at the Sunset Five.

584
00:42:08,292 --> 00:42:11,224
If you decide you would like to
join the human race, meet me there.

585
00:42:16,692 --> 00:42:21,022
Uh, now, in other news, they found
a cure for cancer. Okay. Uh, moving on.

586
00:42:21,092 --> 00:42:24,217
- No, they--
- Do you ever hear from Wendy?

587
00:42:24,293 --> 00:42:27,884
What on Earth made you think of Wendy?

588
00:42:27,959 --> 00:42:32,550
- Oh, I don't know.
Just thinking about the old days. - Yes.

589
00:42:32,625 --> 00:42:35,024
Very old. Ancient.

590
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:41,456
Well, do you?
Do you ever hear from her?

591
00:42:41,526 --> 00:42:43,458
Any reason I should?

592
00:42:43,526 --> 00:42:47,050
Any reason you should keep
her picture in your desk?

593
00:42:49,927 --> 00:42:54,156
None that you should concern yourself with.

594
00:42:54,227 --> 00:42:58,853
Viagra. Oh, God.

595
00:42:58,928 --> 00:43:02,792
Viagra. That's what everyone's
talking about. Are you on it yet?

596
00:43:02,861 --> 00:43:05,020
Just the men.
Okay, uh, well...

597
00:43:05,093 --> 00:43:07,321
it's so successful,
you know, of course--

598
00:43:17,695 --> 00:43:19,627
- Hey. I made it.
- Hi.

599
00:43:19,695 --> 00:43:23,821
- Uh, casually attired.
- Wow.

600
00:43:23,894 --> 00:43:26,326
Yeah, I know. The flowers are
a little much, and I'm late.

601
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:28,521
But only because I had second thoughts
about the flowers...

602
00:43:28,596 --> 00:43:31,619
and I threw them away halfway down the
block, and then I had third thoughts...

603
00:43:31,696 --> 00:43:33,719
and went back and got them.

604
00:43:33,795 --> 00:43:36,057
Well, I'm glad you did.

605
00:43:36,129 --> 00:43:38,425
Thank you.

606
00:43:38,496 --> 00:43:40,428
Come in.
Come in, come in, come in.

607
00:43:40,496 --> 00:43:44,623
- Thanks.
- I, uh-- I hope you like Italian.

608
00:43:44,696 --> 00:43:46,889
- I hope you like merlot.
- I do.

609
00:43:46,963 --> 00:43:48,986
Wow! That's a--

610
00:43:49,063 --> 00:43:50,995
- Barley.
- That's some dog! That's, uh--

611
00:43:51,063 --> 00:43:54,291
- Barley, get down, sweetie. Come on. Come on.
- Whoa.

612
00:43:54,363 --> 00:43:56,988
- My family has a thing for pets.
- Yeah. Oh.

613
00:43:57,063 --> 00:43:59,529
That's, uh--
That's certainly impressive.

614
00:43:59,596 --> 00:44:04,121
Suddenly I'm feeling
a little inadequate. That's--

615
00:44:05,198 --> 00:44:07,823
I, uh-- It's almost ready.
I, uh--

616
00:44:07,897 --> 00:44:12,556
Sorry that took me so long. I was
on the phone with one of my sisters.

617
00:44:13,864 --> 00:44:17,387
- The married one.
- The one who's having an affair?

618
00:44:17,463 --> 00:44:19,691
Yeah, well, the one
who's always having an affair.

619
00:44:19,764 --> 00:44:22,027
Her husband doesn't
suspect anything?

620
00:44:22,098 --> 00:44:25,723
Her husband is sweet,
but he's a bit dim.

621
00:44:27,264 --> 00:44:29,856
He doesn't have
much of an imagination.

622
00:44:29,932 --> 00:44:32,864
Chandler girls like their men
with imagination?

623
00:44:32,932 --> 00:44:35,227
Yeah. It helps.

624
00:44:36,565 --> 00:44:40,828
You know, I'm told
I have a good imagination.

625
00:44:42,832 --> 00:44:45,025
I don't want
to have sex tonight.

626
00:44:48,732 --> 00:44:52,061
- Okay.
- I mean if that's why you thought I invited you over here--

627
00:44:52,132 --> 00:44:54,257
- I invited myself over here.
- Well, whatever.

628
00:44:54,332 --> 00:44:57,322
- I mean, I know that must be kind of unusual.
- It's not unusual. I--

629
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,332
I mean, I'm sure that most women
don't turn you down.

630
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,798
Meredith, can we talk about
something else?

631
00:45:01,867 --> 00:45:04,492
Honestly, sex is the last thing
on my mind right now.

632
00:45:04,567 --> 00:45:06,795
- Okay, okay.
- Okay?

633
00:45:06,866 --> 00:45:10,026
Okay. Okay.

634
00:45:10,099 --> 00:45:13,658
Want a taste? I mean, I-I'm sorry
if I ruined your plans. That's all.

635
00:45:13,734 --> 00:45:16,666
I didn't have any plans!
I just think--

636
00:45:16,734 --> 00:45:19,165
You know, you've got
a few too many rules working for you...

637
00:45:19,234 --> 00:45:22,200
and way too many rules
workin' against me!

638
00:45:22,267 --> 00:45:25,461
I really like you, but--

639
00:45:25,534 --> 00:45:28,125
This kind of thing
is pissing me off.

640
00:45:31,535 --> 00:45:34,296
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.

641
00:45:37,402 --> 00:45:40,526
I can't understand why you haven't had
a relationship lately.

642
00:45:43,534 --> 00:45:47,228
Really?
Well, that doesn't take long, does it?

643
00:45:47,302 --> 00:45:49,530
- What doesn't?
- I mean, you turn a guy down...

644
00:45:49,602 --> 00:45:52,727
a-and wham, he just metamorphoses
into an anger ball.

645
00:45:52,802 --> 00:45:54,961
- "Anger ball"?
- See?

646
00:45:55,036 --> 00:45:58,468
All I said was
I have a good imagination.

647
00:45:58,535 --> 00:46:01,729
- I wasn't talking about sex.
- Really.

648
00:46:01,802 --> 00:46:04,791
I've had enough... sex.

649
00:46:04,869 --> 00:46:06,802
Mostly with women
I didn't really like...

650
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:10,132
a-and probably
didn't really like me.

651
00:46:12,636 --> 00:46:14,829
Call me nuts, man,
but I-- I like you.

652
00:46:14,903 --> 00:46:17,232
And...

653
00:46:17,303 --> 00:46:20,792
yeah, if something happens between us,
sex will probably enter into it.

654
00:46:20,870 --> 00:46:24,667
But not until you break
the brick wall down around yourself...

655
00:46:24,737 --> 00:46:28,066
and certainly not tonight.

656
00:46:31,037 --> 00:46:32,970
Are you finished?

657
00:46:34,070 --> 00:46:36,536
- Yeah.
- I'll show you out.

658
00:46:38,137 --> 00:46:41,695
- What!
- Look, this is exactly what I don't want.

659
00:46:41,771 --> 00:46:43,670
- Somebody being straight with you?
- Yes!

660
00:46:43,738 --> 00:46:46,965
Yes, yes.

661
00:46:47,038 --> 00:46:51,562
You know what, Trent?
I do not have the stamina for this.

662
00:46:51,638 --> 00:46:53,570
I don't.

663
00:46:53,638 --> 00:46:56,570
- Meredith, we haven't even started anything.
- You know what?

664
00:46:56,638 --> 00:47:00,298
We're not going to.

665
00:47:00,372 --> 00:47:04,031
Because let me just jump ahead
to the inevitable. Okay?

666
00:47:05,105 --> 00:47:07,037
We get together.

667
00:47:07,105 --> 00:47:10,071
You hurt me.
It ends badly.

668
00:47:10,139 --> 00:47:14,299
That's a really depressing way
to look at a fledgling relationship.

669
00:47:14,372 --> 00:47:17,735
Well, there's nothing
fledgling about it.

670
00:47:17,805 --> 00:47:20,704
And honestly, that is
the only viewpoint that I have.

671
00:47:23,673 --> 00:47:27,469
Then I feel sorry for you,
Meredith, because I didn't
come over here to hurt you.

672
00:47:33,106 --> 00:47:36,470
- I hope Barley likes Italian.
- He does.

673
00:47:51,107 --> 00:47:52,834
What?

674
00:48:04,641 --> 00:48:07,072
What are you watching?

675
00:48:07,141 --> 00:48:09,403
Midnight Lace.

676
00:48:09,474 --> 00:48:12,908
Ah. Doris Day.

677
00:48:12,975 --> 00:48:15,567
Oh, yeah. That's the one
where she thinks she's going crazy...

678
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:18,335
but it's really her husband
that's driving her to suicide...

679
00:48:18,409 --> 00:48:20,398
for her money.

680
00:48:20,475 --> 00:48:22,997
Well, thank you, Paul!

681
00:48:23,075 --> 00:48:26,508
Why don't you just go-- go find
a theater that's showing Citizen Kane...

682
00:48:26,576 --> 00:48:29,168
and yell out
"Rosebud is a sled"?

683
00:48:29,243 --> 00:48:31,709
- I'm sorry. I thought you'd seen it before.
- Well, I hadn't.

684
00:48:31,777 --> 00:48:34,140
I mean, I thought we'd seen it before.

685
00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:36,801
Perhaps you have me confused
with Wendy.

686
00:48:36,876 --> 00:48:38,808
So that's what this is all about.

687
00:48:38,876 --> 00:48:43,332
- What "this"? There isn't any "this."
- No? No "this"?

688
00:48:43,410 --> 00:48:45,467
Do you normally speak
through clenched teeth?

689
00:48:45,543 --> 00:48:48,374
I'm not speaking any different
than normal.

690
00:48:48,444 --> 00:48:51,001
- Differently.
- Oh!

691
00:49:01,974 --> 00:49:03,906
You are being idiotic.

692
00:49:03,974 --> 00:49:08,566
Well, you wouldn't want me to act
any different than normal, would you?

693
00:49:08,641 --> 00:49:12,005
- "Differently."
- This isn't exactly what I had in mind.

694
00:49:12,075 --> 00:49:14,563
- Do you still see her?
- Who?

695
00:49:14,641 --> 00:49:17,471
"Who?" Who?
Doris Day!

696
00:49:17,541 --> 00:49:20,064
Oh, you mean Wendy.

697
00:49:20,142 --> 00:49:22,734
You thought I didn't know,
didn't you?

698
00:49:22,809 --> 00:49:26,400
You think the little woman doesn't know
when her husband has an affair.

699
00:49:26,475 --> 00:49:31,135
Hannah, it was 25 years ago,
and it wasn't an affair.

700
00:49:31,209 --> 00:49:33,402
Oh, don't insult my intelligence.

701
00:49:33,475 --> 00:49:37,067
Your intelligence, at the moment,
is in serious doubt.

702
00:49:37,142 --> 00:49:39,904
- Screw you!
- Hannah.

703
00:49:39,976 --> 00:49:42,465
Paul.

704
00:49:48,810 --> 00:49:53,071
Do you really want
to talk about this? Hmm?

705
00:49:53,143 --> 00:49:58,338
Because if you do, I'll tell you
everything you want to know.

706
00:49:58,411 --> 00:50:01,343
You might start
by being honest with me.

707
00:50:01,411 --> 00:50:04,206
- It wasn't an affair?
- It wasn't.

708
00:50:04,277 --> 00:50:08,868
- I never slept with Wendy.
- Oh, please!

709
00:50:08,944 --> 00:50:11,342
Hey, calm down.
You're overwrought.

710
00:50:11,411 --> 00:50:13,673
I am perfectly wrought.

711
00:50:13,743 --> 00:50:16,835
Given the circumstances,
I'm even a bit underwrought.

712
00:50:16,911 --> 00:50:19,673
- There's no such word.
- There is now.

713
00:50:21,579 --> 00:50:25,511
Do you want to know...
why I didn't sleep with Wendy?

714
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:34,703
I am, as they say, all ears.

715
00:50:34,779 --> 00:50:38,212
Well, I never
slept with Wendy...

716
00:50:38,279 --> 00:50:41,268
because I was
too much in love with her.

717
00:50:43,679 --> 00:50:45,611
Oh.

718
00:50:50,445 --> 00:50:53,640
You couldn't have died
without telling me that?

719
00:51:07,379 --> 00:51:09,642
Keenan? You going out?

720
00:51:09,714 --> 00:51:13,305
Yes, Dad.

721
00:51:17,714 --> 00:51:20,475
Hi. I know for this technically
not to be a date...

722
00:51:20,547 --> 00:51:23,980
we should have gone dutch, but the
tickets were selling out so fast, so--

723
00:51:24,047 --> 00:51:27,071
What would you have done
if I didn't show up?

724
00:51:27,148 --> 00:51:29,637
Um, well, after I recovered from
the supreme disappointment...

725
00:51:29,715 --> 00:51:32,306
and picked up the pieces
of my fractured ego...

726
00:51:32,381 --> 00:51:36,143
I would have run down the escalator and
invited the guy standing on the corner.

727
00:51:36,215 --> 00:51:38,147
You know, the one holding the sign.

728
00:51:38,215 --> 00:51:40,807
The one that says,
"Will work for food"?

729
00:51:40,881 --> 00:51:44,143
Or a movie.
You should have read the fine print.

730
00:51:47,549 --> 00:51:50,310
# I'll plant my own tree #

731
00:51:50,382 --> 00:51:54,075
# And I'll make it grow #

732
00:51:54,149 --> 00:51:56,910
# My tree will not be #

733
00:51:56,982 --> 00:52:00,880
# Just one in a row #

734
00:52:00,949 --> 00:52:03,916
# My tree will offer shade #

735
00:52:03,983 --> 00:52:07,779
# When strangers go by #

736
00:52:07,849 --> 00:52:10,077
# If you're a stranger #

737
00:52:10,150 --> 00:52:12,412
# Brother, well, so am I #

738
00:52:12,483 --> 00:52:14,449
Gin gimlet, rocks.

739
00:52:14,517 --> 00:52:16,449
Make it two.

740
00:52:16,516 --> 00:52:18,573
- I'm Lana.
- Hugh.

741
00:52:18,649 --> 00:52:21,276
I haven't seen you here before.

742
00:52:21,351 --> 00:52:25,078
- Well, how do you know that?
- Honey, you sounded
like John Wayne in a bathhouse.

743
00:52:25,151 --> 00:52:28,083
Well, as a matter of fact, this is my first time here.

744
00:52:28,151 --> 00:52:31,412
I'm 28 years old,
in case you're wondering.

745
00:52:31,483 --> 00:52:34,245
And that's in real years,
not Heather Locklear years.

746
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:36,284
I'm also a drag queen.

747
00:52:36,350 --> 00:52:40,250
- I think I figured that out.
- Well, I just didn't want
there to be any misunderstanding.

748
00:52:40,318 --> 00:52:42,546
This ain't no disco, and I don't want
no Crying Game confusion.

749
00:52:42,618 --> 00:52:45,413
I want it understood up front,
I may be a fabulous-looking broad...

750
00:52:45,484 --> 00:52:47,416
but I've got a penis.

751
00:52:47,484 --> 00:52:50,416
- So do I.
- Well, then we'll get along just fine.

752
00:52:50,484 --> 00:52:54,507
So you come on and tell Lana what
the fuck you're doing in this place.

753
00:52:54,585 --> 00:52:58,848
Um... I had a...
fight with my wife.

754
00:52:58,919 --> 00:53:01,350
- Old story.
- Well, it's an old story...

755
00:53:01,419 --> 00:53:04,011
but it's a newish twist.

756
00:53:04,085 --> 00:53:07,017
"Newish twist"? Damn, that's a bitch
to say with my sibilance.

757
00:53:07,085 --> 00:53:09,017
I'll have to roll that one
around my tongue later.

758
00:53:09,085 --> 00:53:13,415
Unless you got better ideas.
"Newish twist." Continue.

759
00:53:13,485 --> 00:53:17,782
My wife discovered
I was stepping out on her.

760
00:53:17,853 --> 00:53:19,751
When does the "newish" part come in?

761
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:21,752
That one's older
than Lauren Bacall.

762
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:25,183
Well, I-I cheated on my wife...

763
00:53:25,253 --> 00:53:27,844
with her brother.

764
00:53:27,919 --> 00:53:32,512
Make that a double, and keep 'em coming.

765
00:53:32,588 --> 00:53:35,019
# It's impossible
Tell you right now #

766
00:53:35,087 --> 00:53:37,553
# If I tried it
I'd never know how #

767
00:53:37,621 --> 00:53:40,984
He's her younger brother. Sam.

768
00:53:41,054 --> 00:53:43,849
I knew he was gay, of course.
You can always tell.

769
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:46,182
It's called "gay-dar."

770
00:53:46,254 --> 00:53:48,845
- I'm not gay or anything.
- No, no, no.

771
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:50,853
Of course not.

772
00:53:50,921 --> 00:53:53,853
It's just something about him.

773
00:53:53,921 --> 00:53:58,183
He always looked at me
like he could see right inside me...

774
00:53:58,255 --> 00:54:00,187
to my true soul.

775
00:54:12,189 --> 00:54:15,621
Don't look at me with that tone of voice.

776
00:54:19,189 --> 00:54:23,553
Let me...
try and explain this.

777
00:54:23,622 --> 00:54:27,612
Wendy came along at a time
when I needed somebody.

778
00:54:27,690 --> 00:54:33,452
If this is supposed to be making me
feel better, you're failing miserably.

779
00:54:33,523 --> 00:54:35,614
It didn't mean
that I didn't love you.

780
00:54:35,690 --> 00:54:37,883
In fact, it meant that I did love you.

781
00:54:37,957 --> 00:54:40,115
Well...

782
00:54:40,189 --> 00:54:44,782
you seem to have been loving
a lot of people right about then:

783
00:54:44,857 --> 00:54:47,118
the kids...

784
00:54:47,190 --> 00:54:50,122
Wendy, me.

785
00:54:50,190 --> 00:54:52,179
Anybody else?

786
00:54:52,257 --> 00:54:54,723
Hannah, we've been married
for 40 years.

787
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:57,552
There were some rough times.
Admit it.

788
00:54:57,624 --> 00:55:00,055
Oh, I admit it.

789
00:55:00,123 --> 00:55:03,056
This is one of them.

790
00:55:03,124 --> 00:55:06,386
You know I spent a lot of time
that summer with Wendy.

791
00:55:06,458 --> 00:55:09,720
Our production company
did throw us together.

792
00:55:09,791 --> 00:55:12,383
If I remember correctly, I hired her.

793
00:55:12,458 --> 00:55:16,890
Right. We were launching
your first show.

794
00:55:16,958 --> 00:55:20,392
And... well, Wendy was a big help.

795
00:55:20,459 --> 00:55:22,516
Oh, I'll bet.

796
00:55:26,125 --> 00:55:28,886
- Were you really in love with her?
- Yes.

797
00:55:28,959 --> 00:55:32,891
Yeah, I was.
I remember wishing then that I wasn't.

798
00:55:32,959 --> 00:55:35,152
I couldn't think straight
for a whole year.

799
00:55:36,793 --> 00:55:40,555
- That's when you lost all that weight.
- Yes.

800
00:55:40,626 --> 00:55:44,389
- I thought it was overwork.
- It was Wendy.

801
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:49,391
- I didn't love you any less.
- Oh, don't.

802
00:55:49,459 --> 00:55:51,550
- I didn't.
- Don't.

803
00:55:51,626 --> 00:55:55,253
I just loved her...

804
00:55:55,327 --> 00:55:57,260
differently.

805
00:55:57,327 --> 00:55:59,259
Differently.

806
00:55:59,327 --> 00:56:01,259
Mm-hmm.

807
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:06,185
And you really didn't
sleep with her?

808
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:08,192
No.

809
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:12,322
Of course not.

810
00:56:12,394 --> 00:56:15,656
And you didn't want
to sleep with her?

811
00:56:15,728 --> 00:56:18,319
Oh, good God, yes, I did.

812
00:56:21,061 --> 00:56:25,221
You bastard.
You bastard!

813
00:56:25,294 --> 00:56:27,317
What--

814
00:56:27,394 --> 00:56:29,657
- Hey!
- Just don't touch me! Just--

815
00:56:29,729 --> 00:56:32,320
I've had it!

816
00:56:32,395 --> 00:56:34,452
Well, you did ask.

817
00:56:37,729 --> 00:56:39,661
Oh, boy.

818
00:56:51,230 --> 00:56:54,753
A couple times during the movie
I thought you ducked out on me.

819
00:56:54,829 --> 00:56:56,761
I had to use the bathroom.

820
00:56:56,829 --> 00:57:00,091
Well, at crucial times like
these, you should inform a girl
about having a small bladder.

821
00:57:00,163 --> 00:57:02,924
It saves her
from abandonment fantasies.

822
00:57:02,996 --> 00:57:06,430
Would it help at all
if I told you I didn't sit down to pee?

823
00:57:06,497 --> 00:57:09,088
In this theater,
I don't sit down to pee.

824
00:57:16,663 --> 00:57:18,595
Going dancing?

825
00:57:18,663 --> 00:57:20,754
Maybe.

826
00:57:20,830 --> 00:57:23,093
I'm not asking
to go with you, you know.

827
00:57:23,165 --> 00:57:25,596
We can take this slowly.

828
00:57:25,664 --> 00:57:28,755
Joan, this isn't anything.

829
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:32,422
It's not anything now,
and it won't be anything ever.

830
00:57:32,497 --> 00:57:37,759
Wow. Message received.
End of date.

831
00:57:37,831 --> 00:57:40,093
- I'll walk you to your car.
- Oh, that's so sweet.

832
00:57:40,165 --> 00:57:42,098
That is so sweet.
He never wants to see her again...

833
00:57:42,166 --> 00:57:44,757
but he doesn't want her to be
dismembered in the underground parking.

834
00:57:44,832 --> 00:57:48,764
- Where are you parked?
- On the "Artist formerly known as Prince" level.

835
00:57:56,966 --> 00:57:59,694
Which one is yours?

836
00:57:59,766 --> 00:58:02,357
The V.W. in space 23.

837
00:58:02,433 --> 00:58:05,866
Uh, there's nothing in space 23.

838
00:58:05,933 --> 00:58:07,865
Really?

839
00:58:11,766 --> 00:58:14,391
Shit!
Shit!

840
00:58:14,466 --> 00:58:17,695
Shit! Shit!
Shit! Shit!

841
00:58:17,767 --> 00:58:20,130
Shit!
I cannot believe this!

842
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:22,132
I cannot believe this!

843
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:24,132
Maybe you remembered wrong. Maybe
you're on the Rolling Stones level.

844
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:26,632
- No!
- The Madonna level?

845
00:58:26,701 --> 00:58:30,792
- I wouldn't be caught dead on the Madonna level.
- We'll call the police.

846
00:58:30,866 --> 00:58:34,856
- I'm sure they'll be able to find it.
- I can't fucking believe this!

847
00:58:36,435 --> 00:58:38,900
My parents bought me that car.

848
00:58:38,968 --> 00:58:40,900
Joan, don't--

849
00:58:40,968 --> 00:58:42,900
What?
Don't what?

850
00:58:42,968 --> 00:58:46,162
Don't cry?
I don't fucking cry.

851
00:58:46,235 --> 00:58:48,167
It's something
of a thing with me.

852
00:58:50,701 --> 00:58:59,363
#

853
00:58:59,435 --> 00:59:01,697
It's very... nice.

854
00:59:01,768 --> 00:59:06,564
It's a hole, but it suits
me and Blanche just dandy.

855
00:59:06,635 --> 00:59:08,430
Speaking of Blanche--

856
00:59:08,501 --> 00:59:11,060
Jesus!

857
00:59:11,136 --> 00:59:14,465
- You scared her.
- That's the ugliest cat I've ever seen.

858
00:59:14,536 --> 00:59:17,366
- She's an angel.
- She only has one eye.

859
00:59:17,436 --> 00:59:21,596
Yeah, but it's her good one. Come on,
Blanche. That mean man won't hurt you.

860
00:59:21,669 --> 00:59:23,567
Um, I should--
I should be going.

861
00:59:23,636 --> 00:59:25,159
- I can make coffee.
- I don't drink coffee.

862
00:59:26,269 --> 00:59:28,634
He doesn't drink coffee.

863
00:59:29,770 --> 00:59:32,201
- Ovaltine?
- I don't want to--

864
00:59:32,270 --> 00:59:35,862
You don't want to be mean.
Go ahead.

865
00:59:35,937 --> 00:59:38,698
You're terrific.

866
00:59:38,770 --> 00:59:40,702
Sensational, really.

867
00:59:40,770 --> 00:59:43,736
- But I'm not right for you.
- Wow.

868
00:59:43,804 --> 00:59:46,362
You should write
these kiss-offs down.

869
00:59:46,438 --> 00:59:50,063
They'd be perfect for a chapter
called, "Piercing the heart
in exactly ten words."

870
00:59:50,137 --> 00:59:52,069
That was ten words, wasn't it?

871
00:59:52,137 --> 00:59:56,433
"You are terrific. Sensational, really.
But I'm not right for you." Yep.

872
00:59:56,504 --> 00:59:59,129
I can't say any more
except for that I-I'm sorry...

873
00:59:59,204 --> 01:00:01,931
and... um... good-bye.

874
01:00:02,004 --> 01:00:05,460
Good-bye or good night?

875
01:00:05,539 --> 01:00:07,471
Good-bye.

876
01:00:15,705 --> 01:00:18,467
Hey.

877
01:00:18,539 --> 01:00:21,801
Hi. No, you did it
all perfectly.

878
01:00:21,872 --> 01:00:23,963
I'll pick up the car tomorrow.

879
01:00:24,039 --> 01:00:27,301
No, you won't be meeting him.
It didn't work out.

880
01:00:27,373 --> 01:00:31,135
Oh, how should I put this.
He's virtually non compos mentis.

881
01:00:31,206 --> 01:00:33,138
Any resemblance
between any real person...

882
01:00:33,206 --> 01:00:36,104
living or dead,
is purely coincidental.

883
01:00:37,373 --> 01:00:39,306
You want more?

884
01:00:39,374 --> 01:00:42,135
Well, the lad doesn't say much,
and when he does...

885
01:00:42,207 --> 01:00:46,468
he finds just the right words
to crush my soul.

886
01:00:46,540 --> 01:00:48,472
Of course I'm crazy about him.

887
01:00:51,873 --> 01:00:55,703
- Last call!
- We'll have two more apiece.

888
01:00:56,808 --> 01:00:58,899
No... you won't.

889
01:01:00,008 --> 01:01:04,906
#

890
01:01:05,975 --> 01:01:08,964
So, honey...
what's next for you?

891
01:01:10,307 --> 01:01:13,239
I am going to call a taxi...

892
01:01:13,307 --> 01:01:15,297
and tell him to take me--

893
01:01:15,375 --> 01:01:17,307
- Let me guess. Sam's place.
- Sam's place.

894
01:01:17,375 --> 01:01:19,364
Exactly.

895
01:01:19,442 --> 01:01:21,772
Can I tell you something?

896
01:01:21,842 --> 01:01:24,069
I told you everything.

897
01:01:24,141 --> 01:01:26,232
You can tell me anything.

898
01:01:26,308 --> 01:01:28,866
I have had a good time
with you, darlin'.

899
01:01:28,941 --> 01:01:32,397
Right entertaining, it was.

900
01:01:32,476 --> 01:01:34,408
But, sweetie...

901
01:01:34,476 --> 01:01:36,839
who the fuck do you
think you're kidding?

902
01:01:38,376 --> 01:01:40,308
What do you mean?

903
01:01:42,376 --> 01:01:45,240
Lana may be three sheets
to the proverbial wind...

904
01:01:45,309 --> 01:01:47,400
but I don't believe a word...

905
01:01:47,476 --> 01:01:51,909
out of your pretty,
straight-ass mouth.

906
01:01:54,010 --> 01:01:55,942
Nighty-night.

907
01:02:02,576 --> 01:02:05,338
Taxis.

908
01:02:05,410 --> 01:02:09,002
Or... I get off in ten minutes.

909
01:03:03,513 --> 01:03:05,604
Gracie--

910
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:08,771
You don't have to say anything, Roger.

911
01:03:10,180 --> 01:03:12,112
It's been fun.

912
01:03:14,347 --> 01:03:16,279
It's been fun.

913
01:03:33,014 --> 01:03:35,003
Can I buy you a drink?

914
01:03:36,181 --> 01:03:38,114
I already have one.

915
01:03:44,015 --> 01:03:46,106
How about another?

916
01:03:47,681 --> 01:03:51,613
Yo! She'll have another.
I'm gonna have what she's having.

917
01:03:51,681 --> 01:03:54,705
I, uh--
I like your tight body.

918
01:03:54,782 --> 01:03:56,771
It looks like it would
do what I tell it.

919
01:03:56,849 --> 01:03:58,781
What?

920
01:03:58,849 --> 01:04:01,542
- I said--
- No, I heard what you said.

921
01:04:01,616 --> 01:04:05,708
And I'll admit that "What?" was a rather
banal, cliche, non-colorful response.

922
01:04:05,782 --> 01:04:10,044
What I really meant to say was,
"Why don't you do the world
a big, fat, fucking favor...

923
01:04:10,116 --> 01:04:12,275
and crawl back
into your mother's womb?"

924
01:04:12,350 --> 01:04:14,816
Some girls like men
to say things like that to them.

925
01:04:14,883 --> 01:04:17,542
Some girls like men
to take a dump on them.

926
01:04:17,617 --> 01:04:19,583
I'm not either one of those girls.

927
01:04:19,650 --> 01:04:21,707
I love your dirty little mouth.

928
01:04:21,783 --> 01:04:25,545
- This conversation is so over.
- What-- Hey, what's your problem?

929
01:04:25,617 --> 01:04:29,050
What's my problem?
Wow, that is fucking priceless!

930
01:04:29,116 --> 01:04:31,549
You cannot be for real.
Is there a hidden camera around here?

931
01:04:31,618 --> 01:04:33,709
Now, are you a natural redhead?

932
01:04:33,784 --> 01:04:35,875
If you even so much
as think of touching me...

933
01:04:35,951 --> 01:04:37,940
you're gonna find yourself
limping back to your mother's womb.

934
01:04:38,017 --> 01:04:40,483
- I'll take my chances.
- Yeah?

935
01:04:40,551 --> 01:04:43,073
Dude, you okay?

936
01:04:43,150 --> 01:04:45,207
Good one.

937
01:04:49,951 --> 01:04:52,315
Fuck!

938
01:04:52,385 --> 01:04:56,317
- This isn't how it looks.
- Most things aren't.

939
01:04:56,385 --> 01:04:58,283
- Right.
- Joan...

940
01:04:59,884 --> 01:05:02,544
I've been thinkin'.

941
01:05:02,619 --> 01:05:05,551
- And?
- A-And I feel--

942
01:05:06,885 --> 01:05:08,976
- I feel--
- You could have fooled me.

943
01:05:09,052 --> 01:05:13,109
I mean, that you feel.
That you feel anything.

944
01:05:13,186 --> 01:05:16,152
- Okay, now you're being mean.
- You know what, Keenan?

945
01:05:16,219 --> 01:05:19,310
- Pardon me for being an anger ball.
- "An anger ball"?

946
01:05:19,386 --> 01:05:21,613
But a lot has happened to me
in the last few days...

947
01:05:21,685 --> 01:05:24,312
on the emotional roller coaster
which I laughingly call my life.

948
01:05:24,387 --> 01:05:26,750
Hell, a lot's happened to me
in the last few minutes.

949
01:05:26,820 --> 01:05:28,911
So you know what?
Let's just call this the new me.

950
01:05:28,987 --> 01:05:31,544
There was nothing wrong
with the old you.

951
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:35,152
Man--

952
01:05:35,220 --> 01:05:38,652
You can't treat people
like you treat people...

953
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:42,483
and then say something
adorable like that.

954
01:05:44,054 --> 01:05:46,451
There's some things about me
you don't know.

955
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:49,748
I don't know anything about you!

956
01:05:49,887 --> 01:05:52,978
Stop.
Who's going to pay for all of this?

957
01:05:53,054 --> 01:05:55,077
We don't need the depositions now.

958
01:05:55,154 --> 01:05:57,086
I don't do anything for nothing!

959
01:05:57,154 --> 01:06:00,382
- I'll pay him.
- Then I'll be forgiving.

960
01:06:00,455 --> 01:06:02,421
Good. We must go and give
your mother the good news.

961
01:06:02,488 --> 01:06:04,886
And I'll go count my money.

962
01:06:22,656 --> 01:06:25,713
- We're a hit.
- Yeah, well, let's see what the critics have to say.

963
01:06:25,789 --> 01:06:27,846
Hey, who cares
what the critics have to say?

964
01:06:27,922 --> 01:06:29,855
- I do.
- I do.

965
01:06:29,922 --> 01:06:31,854
- Okay.
- I'm sure they'll love it.

966
01:06:35,323 --> 01:06:37,414
It was a good play.

967
01:06:37,490 --> 01:06:40,251
You mean before
I deconstructed it?

968
01:06:40,323 --> 01:06:42,414
Uh, before and after.

969
01:06:42,490 --> 01:06:45,456
I'd say it was the perfect blend
of Moliere and Meredith.

970
01:06:45,523 --> 01:06:48,080
I'm glad you came.

971
01:06:48,156 --> 01:06:51,952
- Last time we saw each other was a bit--
- Yeah, I know.

972
01:06:52,023 --> 01:06:54,183
It didn't quite go
as I had hoped.

973
01:06:54,258 --> 01:06:56,349
You don't have to apologize.

974
01:06:56,424 --> 01:06:58,515
I'm not...
apologizing.

975
01:06:58,590 --> 01:07:00,988
I didn't do anything wrong.

976
01:07:02,091 --> 01:07:04,852
- Oh, and I did, I suppose.
- Uh-huh.

977
01:07:04,924 --> 01:07:08,448
But I've decided
not to let you get away with it.

978
01:07:08,523 --> 01:07:11,013
So, I'm inviting you
to dinner...

979
01:07:11,092 --> 01:07:13,024
at my house.

980
01:07:13,092 --> 01:07:16,183
Tomorrow night, 8:00 sharp.

981
01:07:19,758 --> 01:07:21,690
Don't bring your dog.

982
01:07:26,058 --> 01:07:28,854
You really want
to kiss me, don't you?

983
01:07:28,926 --> 01:07:31,051
- Boy, do I.
- Tell me how much.

984
01:07:31,126 --> 01:07:33,956
- Tell me.
- What's on?

985
01:07:34,026 --> 01:07:35,958
Psycho's going on in ten minutes.

986
01:07:36,026 --> 01:07:39,117
If you're about to say,
"That's the one where the guy
dresses up in his mother's clothes...

987
01:07:39,192 --> 01:07:41,125
and kills people,"
don't bother.

988
01:07:41,192 --> 01:07:43,681
I've already seen this one.
Alone.

989
01:07:43,759 --> 01:07:47,852
I was just wondering when you were
planning on speaking to me again.

990
01:07:47,927 --> 01:07:50,518
I mean, about something
other than Psycho.

991
01:07:50,593 --> 01:07:53,889
It's almost been 24 hours
since we traded barbs.

992
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:57,756
We don't want to get rusty, do we?

993
01:07:57,827 --> 01:08:02,452
I mean, just how much longer
do I have to wait...

994
01:08:02,526 --> 01:08:04,550
for my next dose of vitriol?

995
01:08:04,628 --> 01:08:06,560
How long have you got?

996
01:08:06,628 --> 01:08:10,889
A good question.

997
01:08:15,027 --> 01:08:17,550
Oh, damn.

998
01:08:17,628 --> 01:08:21,116
On the first date
my husband asked me:

999
01:08:21,194 --> 01:08:25,287
"Gracie... do you dream?"

1000
01:08:26,528 --> 01:08:29,119
And I said, "Yes."

1001
01:08:29,195 --> 01:08:34,355
From the time I get up in the morning
until I go to bed at night.

1002
01:08:34,428 --> 01:08:37,882
You know how they say
the first time is never any good?

1003
01:08:39,529 --> 01:08:42,790
Well, with us, it was wonderful.

1004
01:08:46,695 --> 01:08:49,627
I never felt so awake.

1005
01:08:51,363 --> 01:08:55,954
I had to reassure him that crying
was just my standard reaction...

1006
01:08:56,029 --> 01:08:58,461
to tremendous pleasure.

1007
01:09:01,197 --> 01:09:05,129
He held me, and he said
that he wanted to make me cry...

1008
01:09:05,197 --> 01:09:08,458
for the rest of our lives.

1009
01:09:09,696 --> 01:09:12,128
Flash forward 15 years...

1010
01:09:12,197 --> 01:09:17,459
and somehow the two of us
became one... and one.

1011
01:09:20,297 --> 01:09:24,127
And now I find myself living with
a roommate instead of a husband.

1012
01:09:24,197 --> 01:09:26,288
And I have dogs instead of children...

1013
01:09:26,364 --> 01:09:29,797
because I can have dogs,
but I can't have children.

1014
01:09:29,864 --> 01:09:32,797
And--

1015
01:09:32,865 --> 01:09:36,990
Oh, I've forgotten
who blames who for that.

1016
01:09:41,031 --> 01:09:43,463
And I haven't cried
in a very long time.

1017
01:09:53,965 --> 01:09:59,057
My breaking point
happened this afternoon...

1018
01:09:59,132 --> 01:10:02,530
when I picked up my kids
from day care.

1019
01:10:04,633 --> 01:10:06,565
With you...

1020
01:10:06,633 --> 01:10:10,566
I was spontaneous for the first time
in my entire life.

1021
01:10:11,966 --> 01:10:14,989
And I discovered
I'm not very good at spontaneity.

1022
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:21,232
Is there something that you can see
your husband doing...

1023
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:23,891
or saying that would
make a difference?

1024
01:10:23,966 --> 01:10:27,558
Sometimes I think it could be as simple
as his asking me to go for a walk.

1025
01:10:27,634 --> 01:10:29,566
Um...

1026
01:10:31,467 --> 01:10:34,729
anything, so long as it felt
like a start.

1027
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:37,232
Maybe this was your start.

1028
01:10:37,301 --> 01:10:40,357
You're a fucking optimist.

1029
01:10:40,433 --> 01:10:43,161
That's my job.

1030
01:10:54,568 --> 01:10:58,660
This doesn't change anything
about Saturday, does it?

1031
01:10:58,735 --> 01:11:02,668
This doesn't change anything
about Saturday.

1032
01:11:04,969 --> 01:11:08,867
So, let me take a stab
at Keenan's story.

1033
01:11:10,068 --> 01:11:12,001
You had a great love.

1034
01:11:12,068 --> 01:11:14,000
The romance of your lifetime.

1035
01:11:14,068 --> 01:11:17,296
Totally cosmic, out-of-this-world bond
with little Miss X...

1036
01:11:18,402 --> 01:11:20,335
and she left you.

1037
01:11:20,403 --> 01:11:22,994
You're not far off.

1038
01:11:23,069 --> 01:11:25,194
People get over these things, Keenan.

1039
01:11:25,270 --> 01:11:27,929
Hell, I'm getting over these things...
all the time.

1040
01:11:28,003 --> 01:11:30,162
Well, it can only be once for me.

1041
01:11:30,236 --> 01:11:33,100
You're sweet to believe things
so absolutely...

1042
01:11:33,169 --> 01:11:35,658
but you're also full of shit.

1043
01:11:36,802 --> 01:11:38,735
You can love again.

1044
01:11:38,803 --> 01:11:42,735
I can't.
Any more than you--

1045
01:11:42,803 --> 01:11:45,326
- Any more than I can what?
- I don't know.

1046
01:11:45,404 --> 01:11:47,461
A-Any more than you
can stop drinking.

1047
01:11:55,838 --> 01:11:57,827
- Can I get you another one?
- No, I'm fine. Thanks.

1048
01:11:57,904 --> 01:12:01,132
- It was a gin martini, right?
- Vodka, but, really, I've had enough.

1049
01:12:01,205 --> 01:12:03,932
- I insist, please.
- Look, pal--

1050
01:12:04,005 --> 01:12:07,130
And I mean this affectionately,
all right? Scram.

1051
01:12:08,838 --> 01:12:11,599
Where were we?
Oh, yes, I've just given up alcohol...

1052
01:12:11,671 --> 01:12:14,138
and you're going to tell me
about the great love of your life.

1053
01:12:14,206 --> 01:12:17,933
- Her name was Sarah.
- And she was your first?

1054
01:12:18,006 --> 01:12:19,938
Yes.

1055
01:12:20,006 --> 01:12:23,768
Look... it's natural
to elevate our first love...

1056
01:12:23,839 --> 01:12:26,930
to some sort of
mythic emotional plateau.

1057
01:12:27,006 --> 01:12:29,437
But you fell in love, she left you...

1058
01:12:29,505 --> 01:12:31,768
and now you're dealing with
love's most common byproduct:

1059
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:33,806
suicidal manic depression.

1060
01:12:33,873 --> 01:12:35,668
Right?

1061
01:12:35,740 --> 01:12:38,934
- Do you feel better?
- No.

1062
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:44,101
It-- It's hard to talk about.

1063
01:12:44,172 --> 01:12:47,003
I have a friend,
a jazz musician, trumpet player.

1064
01:12:47,072 --> 01:12:50,096
Really terrific.
I go and hear him jam every month or so.

1065
01:12:50,173 --> 01:12:53,367
He plays this piece I love:
an old Chet Baker song.

1066
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:57,167
And he blows the same notes every time,
but every time it sounds different.

1067
01:12:57,240 --> 01:13:01,536
And we had drinks one night--
when I used to drink--

1068
01:13:01,607 --> 01:13:03,539
and I tried to tell him
how that song made me feel...

1069
01:13:03,607 --> 01:13:07,370
how his playing made me feel,
how the music... made me feel.

1070
01:13:07,441 --> 01:13:10,532
And he just kept shaking
his head and he said...

1071
01:13:10,608 --> 01:13:12,540
"Joan, you can't talk about music.

1072
01:13:12,608 --> 01:13:15,869
Talking about music is like
dancing about architecture."

1073
01:13:16,774 --> 01:13:18,707
I said, "Well, okay, fine.

1074
01:13:18,774 --> 01:13:21,434
Gonna get all philosophical on me.
It's as pointless as talking
about a lot of things.

1075
01:13:21,508 --> 01:13:23,440
Love, for instance."

1076
01:13:23,508 --> 01:13:26,031
And my friend laughed,
and he said...

1077
01:13:26,109 --> 01:13:28,041
"Definitely. Most definitely.

1078
01:13:28,109 --> 01:13:31,303
Talking about love is like
dancing about architecture."

1079
01:13:31,376 --> 01:13:33,705
So, I don't know.
He might be right.

1080
01:13:35,109 --> 01:13:38,269
But it ain't gonna
stop me from trying.

1081
01:13:40,476 --> 01:13:44,409
I wish you'd do that
more often: smile.

1082
01:13:44,476 --> 01:13:47,034
So do I.

1083
01:13:50,110 --> 01:13:53,633
So let me guess. You and Wonder Woman
were together a year?

1084
01:13:53,709 --> 01:13:56,301
A year and a half.

1085
01:13:56,376 --> 01:13:58,399
And you were faithful to her?

1086
01:13:58,476 --> 01:14:00,739
Completely.

1087
01:14:00,810 --> 01:14:03,537
And you shared everything.

1088
01:14:09,677 --> 01:14:13,507
We-- We shared everything.

1089
01:14:14,877 --> 01:14:16,968
That must be nice.

1090
01:14:18,378 --> 01:14:20,970
It was...

1091
01:14:21,045 --> 01:14:22,977
but...

1092
01:14:24,878 --> 01:14:29,640
in addition to sharing
all of those things...

1093
01:14:29,711 --> 01:14:33,803
it turns out I was also sharing her...

1094
01:14:33,878 --> 01:14:36,504
with a variety of other people.

1095
01:14:37,879 --> 01:14:39,811
I hate to say this...

1096
01:14:39,879 --> 01:14:42,436
because l-l don't want
to diminish your feelings...

1097
01:14:42,512 --> 01:14:46,137
but, sadly, that happens every day.

1098
01:14:46,212 --> 01:14:48,735
Those other people shared needles.

1099
01:14:56,647 --> 01:15:00,238
She died last year.

1100
01:15:02,812 --> 01:15:06,904
But not before sharing...

1101
01:15:06,979 --> 01:15:10,537
one final thing with me.

1102
01:15:58,749 --> 01:16:01,806
Can I buy you a drink, Valery?

1103
01:16:01,882 --> 01:16:04,610
You seem to be so good at this.

1104
01:16:04,683 --> 01:16:07,843
Oh, I'm fine in scene class,
on stage.

1105
01:16:07,916 --> 01:16:11,848
It's just this improvisational--
I can't do it.

1106
01:16:11,916 --> 01:16:13,848
- Hmm.
- At least not like this.

1107
01:16:15,249 --> 01:16:18,306
Maybe I'm just better
at pretending I'm someone else.

1108
01:16:20,249 --> 01:16:24,182
Well, I gotta go. Um... I'll see you
in class tomorrow for the reports.

1109
01:16:24,250 --> 01:16:26,841
God knows what I'll say.

1110
01:16:26,916 --> 01:16:30,508
- I won't be there.
- Why?

1111
01:16:30,584 --> 01:16:34,641
I, uh-- I like this too much.

1112
01:16:34,717 --> 01:16:38,842
- I'm too good at it.
- I don't understand.

1113
01:16:38,916 --> 01:16:42,350
I'm better at all these lies
that I've manufactured...

1114
01:16:42,418 --> 01:16:45,009
than I am at the lies I'm living.

1115
01:16:48,418 --> 01:16:51,043
I have a wife.
Did you know that?

1116
01:16:53,651 --> 01:16:55,947
I don't think that
we like each other very much.

1117
01:16:58,052 --> 01:17:00,574
Is that something
to smile about?

1118
01:17:03,019 --> 01:17:06,110
Well, it's just that my wife--
She, um...

1119
01:17:06,185 --> 01:17:09,174
doesn't think that I have
much of an imagination.

1120
01:17:09,252 --> 01:17:11,479
If she only knew.

1121
01:17:13,019 --> 01:17:15,781
If she only knew a lot of things.

1122
01:17:15,853 --> 01:17:18,580
If I only knew a lot of things.

1123
01:17:18,653 --> 01:17:20,585
Such as?

1124
01:17:22,519 --> 01:17:24,451
Where to start:

1125
01:17:24,519 --> 01:17:27,781
with myself...

1126
01:17:27,853 --> 01:17:31,013
with my wife.

1127
01:17:43,787 --> 01:17:46,776
They got it back.

1128
01:17:46,854 --> 01:17:49,581
They got what back?

1129
01:17:49,654 --> 01:17:51,587
The police. Your car.

1130
01:17:51,655 --> 01:17:55,052
Oh, right. Yeah.

1131
01:17:55,121 --> 01:17:57,053
Keenan, listen, I'm--

1132
01:17:57,121 --> 01:18:00,383
You don't have to say anything. l-l told
you because I wanted to tell you.

1133
01:18:02,621 --> 01:18:06,212
I wanted to because for
the first time in a long time
I wish things were different.

1134
01:18:06,288 --> 01:18:08,982
- They can be.
- No, they can't.

1135
01:18:17,122 --> 01:18:19,315
Well, none of this means
you can't love.

1136
01:18:19,389 --> 01:18:22,718
Joan, it means exactly that.
It doesn't mean anything else.

1137
01:18:22,788 --> 01:18:25,254
I don't believe that for a second,
that you can't love.

1138
01:18:25,322 --> 01:18:27,380
- I can't.
- Stop saying that.

1139
01:18:27,456 --> 01:18:31,388
It's the only thing I can say
to make you understand.

1140
01:18:32,989 --> 01:18:37,046
This may sound corny, but--

1141
01:18:37,123 --> 01:18:40,555
But you don't want me.

1142
01:18:40,622 --> 01:18:42,588
I-I'm damaged goods.

1143
01:18:42,656 --> 01:18:47,715
For Christ's sake,
we're all damaged goods.

1144
01:18:47,790 --> 01:18:51,722
I'm wandering around through life
with hardly any purpose or goal at all.

1145
01:18:51,790 --> 01:18:54,222
I don't know what
I'm doing half the time...

1146
01:18:54,291 --> 01:18:56,552
but I know that I can love.

1147
01:18:56,623 --> 01:18:58,885
I know that I can love you.
I know that I do love you.

1148
01:18:58,957 --> 01:19:02,152
- I won't let you love me.
- Why?

1149
01:19:04,791 --> 01:19:07,882
I won't let you love me because...

1150
01:19:12,457 --> 01:19:14,889
because I love you.

1151
01:19:16,691 --> 01:19:19,055
You love me?

1152
01:19:19,124 --> 01:19:21,114
- Can I go?
- No!

1153
01:19:23,191 --> 01:19:25,555
Do you know how long I have waited
for somebody I care about...

1154
01:19:25,625 --> 01:19:28,022
to say that they love me
and for me to actually believe them?

1155
01:19:28,091 --> 01:19:30,216
And if you think you're getting out
of this car, you're insane!

1156
01:19:30,292 --> 01:19:32,383
It will never work.

1157
01:19:33,792 --> 01:19:35,724
It's already working.

1158
01:19:35,792 --> 01:19:38,883
It's working.

1159
01:19:45,126 --> 01:19:47,524
I thought--
I thought you didn't cry.

1160
01:19:47,593 --> 01:19:49,718
I thought you didn't date.

1161
01:19:49,792 --> 01:19:53,657
Surprise, I'm crying...

1162
01:19:53,725 --> 01:19:55,817
and this is very much a date.

1163
01:19:55,893 --> 01:20:00,326
It's unconventional, perhaps,
but it's the best date I've ever had.

1164
01:20:09,227 --> 01:20:12,159
I can't!

1165
01:20:12,227 --> 01:20:16,320
No-- Keenan, please!
Please don't go!

1166
01:20:35,395 --> 01:20:37,327
Hey!

1167
01:20:37,395 --> 01:20:40,987
Hi, buddies.
How are you?

1168
01:20:41,062 --> 01:20:43,153
Who's a good boy?
Who's a good boy?

1169
01:20:50,063 --> 01:20:52,426
You're home early tonight.

1170
01:20:53,663 --> 01:20:55,925
You as well.

1171
01:20:55,996 --> 01:20:58,655
Well, inventory's almost over.

1172
01:20:58,729 --> 01:21:01,752
How is your improv class?

1173
01:21:01,829 --> 01:21:04,488
It finished tonight.

1174
01:21:04,562 --> 01:21:07,427
I thought you had
another couple days.

1175
01:21:07,497 --> 01:21:13,293
Well, I should say that
I finished tonight.

1176
01:21:13,363 --> 01:21:15,522
It wasn't what you had in mind?

1177
01:21:15,597 --> 01:21:17,529
Ultimately, no.

1178
01:21:17,597 --> 01:21:23,086
Well... I'm sure you'll find
something you enjoy.

1179
01:21:26,665 --> 01:21:28,597
I mean, to keep you occupied.

1180
01:21:30,031 --> 01:21:32,589
I'm going to try.

1181
01:21:42,499 --> 01:21:45,090
Well, as the British say,
I'm knackered.

1182
01:21:47,332 --> 01:21:50,196
You know what Saturday is, don't you?

1183
01:21:50,265 --> 01:21:52,197
I do.

1184
01:21:52,265 --> 01:21:54,696
Okay.

1185
01:21:54,765 --> 01:21:57,197
It might be easier if we meet there.

1186
01:21:57,265 --> 01:21:59,856
Whatever's easier.

1187
01:21:59,932 --> 01:22:03,694
All right. Did you feed the dogs?
You gave them their pills?

1188
01:22:03,766 --> 01:22:07,528
Okay. Well, don't forget to turn out
the light before you come to bed.

1189
01:22:07,599 --> 01:22:10,360
- I won't.
- Tomorrow's trash day.

1190
01:22:17,265 --> 01:22:21,596
There isn't much more
we can do, except ease the pain.

1191
01:22:22,700 --> 01:22:25,188
All right.

1192
01:22:25,266 --> 01:22:27,528
Ease the pain.

1193
01:22:41,267 --> 01:22:43,529
- Mom?
- Yes, honey.

1194
01:22:43,601 --> 01:22:45,590
- Mom?
- I'm here.

1195
01:22:45,668 --> 01:22:48,361
Wh-Where's Jack?

1196
01:22:48,434 --> 01:22:52,025
- He's not here.
- He was just here a minute ago.

1197
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:54,999
- No?
- No.

1198
01:22:55,068 --> 01:22:59,296
- It was... you who were here.
- Yes, I'm here.

1199
01:22:59,368 --> 01:23:03,857
- You are here, aren't you?
- Yes, I'm here.

1200
01:23:06,368 --> 01:23:08,630
Tell me about death.

1201
01:23:25,536 --> 01:23:28,468
Remember a long time ago...

1202
01:23:28,536 --> 01:23:31,025
when you were still
inside my belly...

1203
01:23:31,103 --> 01:23:34,796
and the contractions began?

1204
01:23:36,870 --> 01:23:40,200
Well, they're beginning again.

1205
01:23:40,270 --> 01:23:44,134
- Read me that story.
- What story?

1206
01:23:44,203 --> 01:23:47,136
The one with the rabbit
and the rocking chair.

1207
01:23:50,537 --> 01:23:52,696
- Good Night, Moon?
- Yeah.

1208
01:23:52,771 --> 01:23:56,226
I like the ending.
Read me the ending.

1209
01:24:13,471 --> 01:24:17,062
Good night, comb.

1210
01:24:17,138 --> 01:24:20,366
Good night, brush.

1211
01:24:20,438 --> 01:24:22,905
Good night, nobody.

1212
01:24:25,472 --> 01:24:28,404
Good night, mush.

1213
01:24:31,306 --> 01:24:36,238
Good night to the old lady
whispering hush.

1214
01:24:38,306 --> 01:24:40,239
Good night, stars.

1215
01:24:41,973 --> 01:24:46,565
Good night... air.

1216
01:24:49,806 --> 01:24:53,170
Good night, noises...

1217
01:24:56,407 --> 01:24:58,340
everywhere.

1218
01:25:51,242 --> 01:25:56,107
Do you ever wonder if
while we spend all this time
anthropomorphizing our animals...

1219
01:25:56,176 --> 01:25:58,608
maybe they're just
anthropomorphizing us?

1220
01:25:58,677 --> 01:26:00,700
Hmm.

1221
01:26:00,777 --> 01:26:04,265
I didn't think so.
Who? Keenan?

1222
01:26:04,343 --> 01:26:08,105
No. Trust me,
I'll never hear from him again.

1223
01:26:08,176 --> 01:26:12,769
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you,
but I'm fresh out of jokes.

1224
01:26:12,844 --> 01:26:16,276
What, is that a rhetorical question?
Why is my life so complicated?

1225
01:26:16,344 --> 01:26:20,106
Gee, I don't know.
Why is your life so fucking simple?

1226
01:26:20,177 --> 01:26:22,769
Hold on. There's someone at the door.

1227
01:26:22,843 --> 01:26:25,503
Well, I don't know until I answer it,
do I? Yeah, I'll ask who it is.

1228
01:26:25,577 --> 01:26:27,510
Hold on.
Yeah.

1229
01:26:31,778 --> 01:26:33,438
Hi.

1230
01:26:33,512 --> 01:26:35,603
Hi.

1231
01:26:35,678 --> 01:26:39,008
Um, I'm just on the phone.
I'm gonna wrap it up, okay?

1232
01:26:49,246 --> 01:26:51,178
M.C.I.

1233
01:26:51,246 --> 01:26:53,507
They're geniuses at tricking you
into conversation.

1234
01:26:53,578 --> 01:26:56,306
I can't stop thinking about you.

1235
01:26:56,379 --> 01:26:58,208
I love conversations that
start with the guy saying...

1236
01:26:58,279 --> 01:27:00,142
"I can't stop thinking about you."

1237
01:27:00,212 --> 01:27:02,838
Mind you, I've never actually
been on the receiving end
of any of those conversations.

1238
01:27:02,913 --> 01:27:04,845
Just looking at you
makes me happy.

1239
01:27:04,913 --> 01:27:07,038
I have--
I have to sit down.

1240
01:27:10,013 --> 01:27:14,377
When we're together,
whether or not I show it...

1241
01:27:14,446 --> 01:27:18,936
I just can't wait to hear
the next words out of your mouth.

1242
01:27:19,013 --> 01:27:23,140
But right now I need to ask you
to do something for me.

1243
01:27:23,213 --> 01:27:25,146
Anything.

1244
01:27:25,213 --> 01:27:28,873
Shut up.
Just for a moment.

1245
01:27:28,947 --> 01:27:31,674
I've been-- I've been thinking about
what you said last night.

1246
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:37,042
I have no idea
why you're so relentless...

1247
01:27:37,113 --> 01:27:39,706
particularly, given the arsenal
of defenses I've thrown at you.

1248
01:27:39,782 --> 01:27:41,714
But...

1249
01:27:43,448 --> 01:27:49,347
no matter how hard I've tried to block
out everything that you've said...

1250
01:27:49,415 --> 01:27:51,438
the message has been received.

1251
01:27:54,881 --> 01:27:58,144
In a place inside me
that I thought had died.

1252
01:27:59,215 --> 01:28:01,942
But it hasn't.

1253
01:28:03,716 --> 01:28:07,478
And that place inside me
is alive and well.

1254
01:28:11,049 --> 01:28:13,140
I can't make any promises...

1255
01:28:13,215 --> 01:28:15,647
but...

1256
01:28:15,716 --> 01:28:18,478
I'd like to try and be with you.

1257
01:28:21,116 --> 01:28:25,139
It won't be easy,
but I'd like to try.

1258
01:28:25,216 --> 01:28:27,444
Can I say something?

1259
01:28:35,617 --> 01:28:39,311
You're right.
It won't be easy, but...

1260
01:28:42,383 --> 01:28:44,576
that's okay.

1261
01:28:46,051 --> 01:28:50,212
I want to be with you, but,
you have to understand, I, um--

1262
01:28:50,285 --> 01:28:52,307
- We can't--
- Have sex.

1263
01:28:52,384 --> 01:28:55,817
It may not be the conventional wisdom,
but it's the only way I can do this.

1264
01:28:55,885 --> 01:28:58,010
At least for the time being.

1265
01:28:59,384 --> 01:29:01,350
That's not a problem?

1266
01:29:01,418 --> 01:29:06,976
When was having sex
or not having sex not a problem?

1267
01:29:07,053 --> 01:29:11,815
To be honest, it's gonna
be difficult not to express
physically what I feel for you...

1268
01:29:11,886 --> 01:29:16,284
but...
we can look for other ways.

1269
01:29:16,352 --> 01:29:21,444
There's nothing wrong
with holding each other. Hmm?

1270
01:29:21,519 --> 01:29:24,007
Nothing at all.

1271
01:29:24,085 --> 01:29:26,018
And sleeping with each other.

1272
01:29:26,086 --> 01:29:28,018
We can do that.

1273
01:29:28,086 --> 01:29:30,848
And... loving each other forever.

1274
01:29:32,386 --> 01:29:35,477
What did I ever do to deserve you?

1275
01:29:35,553 --> 01:29:39,814
Usually that line is screamed at me
by somebody running out the door...

1276
01:29:39,886 --> 01:29:43,650
not standing in front
of me and staying.

1277
01:29:43,721 --> 01:29:46,482
It makes for a nice change.

1278
01:29:46,554 --> 01:29:50,316
# Lay it down, child #

1279
01:29:53,020 --> 01:29:55,418
# Lay it down, child #

1280
01:29:55,487 --> 01:30:01,079
# And walk into this room #

1281
01:30:07,587 --> 01:30:09,519
Ah, flowers.

1282
01:30:09,587 --> 01:30:12,418
How thoughtful.

1283
01:30:12,487 --> 01:30:15,578
Whoo. We like the same merlot.

1284
01:30:15,654 --> 01:30:18,587
It's actually the very same bottle
that you brought to my house.

1285
01:30:18,655 --> 01:30:21,144
Excellent.

1286
01:30:21,222 --> 01:30:23,245
Come on in.

1287
01:30:23,323 --> 01:30:25,255
Wow.

1288
01:30:30,488 --> 01:30:34,080
- You're wondering where dinner is.
- Uh, I must say.

1289
01:30:34,156 --> 01:30:36,418
I have a little confession to make.

1290
01:30:36,489 --> 01:30:39,751
I invited you to dinner at my house,
but I can't cook.

1291
01:30:39,823 --> 01:30:41,914
Oh.

1292
01:30:41,990 --> 01:30:43,922
I can order delivery.

1293
01:30:43,990 --> 01:30:46,081
All right.

1294
01:30:46,156 --> 01:30:48,418
Chinese food is my specialty.

1295
01:30:58,090 --> 01:31:00,522
What are we making?

1296
01:31:00,590 --> 01:31:02,681
Some hemlock.

1297
01:31:02,757 --> 01:31:05,279
Oh, please, don't deprive
the kids of their mother.

1298
01:31:05,357 --> 01:31:09,687
- Oh, I'm not making it for me.
- Ah, that's the Hannah that I know.

1299
01:31:09,757 --> 01:31:13,622
Well, you seem to know me
a lot better than I know you.

1300
01:31:13,692 --> 01:31:16,021
You know that's not true.

1301
01:31:16,091 --> 01:31:21,388
Do you remember what you told
the kids about falling in love?

1302
01:31:22,757 --> 01:31:25,189
- No.
- Well, I do.

1303
01:31:25,258 --> 01:31:28,690
You said that the wonderful thing
about falling in love...

1304
01:31:28,757 --> 01:31:34,521
is that you learn everything
about that person, and so quickly.

1305
01:31:34,592 --> 01:31:36,524
And if it's true love...

1306
01:31:36,592 --> 01:31:40,024
then you start to see yourself
through their eyes...

1307
01:31:40,092 --> 01:31:42,024
and it brings out
the best in you...

1308
01:31:42,092 --> 01:31:46,524
and it's almost as if you're
falling in love with yourself.

1309
01:31:46,591 --> 01:31:49,854
- I said that?
- Mm-hmm.

1310
01:31:49,926 --> 01:31:54,222
Well, 25 years ago,
I needed to feel that again.

1311
01:31:54,293 --> 01:31:57,622
Feel that I was worth loving.

1312
01:31:57,693 --> 01:32:00,125
Because somehow I knew...

1313
01:32:00,193 --> 01:32:04,522
that would be my last time
to have that particular feeling.

1314
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:09,952
- You couldn't have it with me?
- Oh, I did have it with you...

1315
01:32:10,027 --> 01:32:12,118
but I'd forgotten it.

1316
01:32:12,194 --> 01:32:14,955
I hadn't forgotten
why I loved you...

1317
01:32:15,027 --> 01:32:17,857
but I'd forgotten
why you loved me.

1318
01:32:21,860 --> 01:32:24,622
And Wendy made me remember...

1319
01:32:24,695 --> 01:32:28,286
that I was a pretty terrific fellow.

1320
01:32:28,361 --> 01:32:30,793
Bully for Wendy.

1321
01:32:30,861 --> 01:32:34,793
But I knew that
I couldn't sleep with her.

1322
01:32:34,861 --> 01:32:36,486
Why?

1323
01:32:36,561 --> 01:32:40,722
Because I would have left you...
and the kids.

1324
01:32:51,362 --> 01:32:54,226
What are we thinking?

1325
01:32:54,295 --> 01:32:56,886
Hot liquid and facial burns.

1326
01:32:56,961 --> 01:32:59,224
Oh.

1327
01:32:59,296 --> 01:33:04,388
Remember the day
Wendy left the company...

1328
01:33:04,463 --> 01:33:07,395
- and went to Seattle?
- Yes.

1329
01:33:07,463 --> 01:33:09,554
I thought for a while
you might go with her.

1330
01:33:09,630 --> 01:33:12,562
Me too, but I didn't.

1331
01:33:16,297 --> 01:33:18,888
When I came home that day...

1332
01:33:18,963 --> 01:33:23,055
I realized that I was
more in love with you...

1333
01:33:23,130 --> 01:33:25,392
than ever before.

1334
01:33:27,130 --> 01:33:30,562
How did that thunderbolt strike you?

1335
01:33:30,630 --> 01:33:33,721
Because I'd made a choice.

1336
01:33:34,964 --> 01:33:38,396
I took one look at you...

1337
01:33:38,464 --> 01:33:43,056
and I knew I'd made
the right choice.

1338
01:33:43,131 --> 01:33:45,392
I know that sounds daft...

1339
01:33:45,464 --> 01:33:49,227
but my love for somebody else...

1340
01:33:49,297 --> 01:33:52,163
made me love you more...

1341
01:33:52,231 --> 01:33:56,493
because I sought...

1342
01:33:56,565 --> 01:33:58,497
to reclaim myself.

1343
01:34:00,231 --> 01:34:02,493
And, Hannah...

1344
01:34:02,565 --> 01:34:05,497
you're still the right choice.

1345
01:34:08,565 --> 01:34:11,498
We made a child that day.

1346
01:34:11,566 --> 01:34:13,498
We did, indeed.

1347
01:34:13,566 --> 01:34:16,157
Our Jo-Jo.

1348
01:34:16,232 --> 01:34:19,824
Yeah. We did, indeed.

1349
01:34:35,233 --> 01:34:37,824
- Cheers.
- Thank you.

1350
01:34:40,567 --> 01:34:43,499
Trent...

1351
01:34:43,567 --> 01:34:45,625
I have to tell you something.

1352
01:34:45,701 --> 01:34:49,156
Oh, this doesn't begin with
"Trent, you are a nice guy," does it?

1353
01:34:49,234 --> 01:34:51,530
- No.
- Whew.

1354
01:34:51,601 --> 01:34:55,260
The problem I have with you--

1355
01:34:56,667 --> 01:34:58,929
We have problems?

1356
01:35:02,834 --> 01:35:06,597
The problem I have with you...

1357
01:35:06,668 --> 01:35:09,430
is that I'm attracted to you.

1358
01:35:11,501 --> 01:35:13,467
And that's a problem?

1359
01:35:15,535 --> 01:35:18,660
It is for me.

1360
01:35:18,735 --> 01:35:21,930
It's, um--

1361
01:35:23,170 --> 01:35:25,261
Gosh, this is so embarrassing.

1362
01:35:25,336 --> 01:35:27,268
What?

1363
01:35:27,336 --> 01:35:29,928
Don't be embarrassed.

1364
01:35:33,669 --> 01:35:36,760
I don't deal with passion well.

1365
01:35:36,836 --> 01:35:39,928
Maybe you don't like
that loss of control.

1366
01:35:40,004 --> 01:35:44,096
You prefer to be the director,
telling everyone what to do.

1367
01:35:45,670 --> 01:35:48,261
It's pretty painfully obvious,
isn't it?

1368
01:35:48,337 --> 01:35:51,531
Somewhat painful, yes.

1369
01:35:54,103 --> 01:35:57,366
You know, there's something
you'll find out about me.

1370
01:35:57,438 --> 01:35:59,870
What's that?

1371
01:35:59,937 --> 01:36:03,529
#

1372
01:36:03,604 --> 01:36:06,365
That I take direction pretty well.

1373
01:36:13,771 --> 01:36:16,363
# If love is a healer #

1374
01:36:16,439 --> 01:36:20,701
# We'll be the first ones healed #

1375
01:36:20,771 --> 01:36:24,363
# Lovers will #

1376
01:36:24,439 --> 01:36:28,462
# You know, lovers will #

1377
01:36:31,771 --> 01:36:33,704
- Trent.
- Yeah?

1378
01:36:33,772 --> 01:36:36,364
You're gonna think what I'm about
to say is really ridiculous.

1379
01:36:36,440 --> 01:36:39,201
You're worried about Barley,
and you want to go back to your place.

1380
01:36:39,273 --> 01:36:43,205
Oh, my God.
This is way fucking spooky.

1381
01:36:44,772 --> 01:36:48,034
# Lay it down, child #

1382
01:36:50,107 --> 01:36:53,301
# Lay it down, child #

1383
01:36:53,374 --> 01:36:56,135
# And walk into this room #

1384
01:36:56,207 --> 01:36:59,139
I forgot what it felt like
to be this close to someone.

1385
01:36:59,207 --> 01:37:03,639
I have never been
this close to anyone.

1386
01:37:11,041 --> 01:37:14,302
We're always gonna be honest
with each other, right?

1387
01:37:14,374 --> 01:37:16,806
It's essential.

1388
01:37:16,874 --> 01:37:21,806
Um... I have
to confess something.

1389
01:37:23,008 --> 01:37:24,940
Shoot.

1390
01:37:27,042 --> 01:37:31,736
Um... the night we went to the movies,
and you walked me to my car--

1391
01:37:31,809 --> 01:37:34,138
You mean the car
that you pretended was stolen?

1392
01:37:34,208 --> 01:37:37,538
You knew?

1393
01:37:37,608 --> 01:37:39,904
Joan--

1394
01:37:43,543 --> 01:37:45,974
I may have been a basket case that evening...

1395
01:37:46,042 --> 01:37:48,634
but I wasn't born yesterday.

1396
01:37:48,710 --> 01:37:50,801
I am so embarrassed.

1397
01:37:52,309 --> 01:37:55,571
No. No.

1398
01:37:58,142 --> 01:38:01,836
Oh-- Oh, well.

1399
01:38:01,910 --> 01:38:05,740
#

1400
01:38:05,810 --> 01:38:07,867
I so very much love you.

1401
01:38:07,943 --> 01:38:10,569
And I love you.

1402
01:38:12,477 --> 01:38:14,409
And, Joan?

1403
01:38:14,477 --> 01:38:16,409
Yes, Keenan.

1404
01:38:16,477 --> 01:38:21,103
In time... I may even get
to like this mangy cat of ours.

1405
01:38:23,478 --> 01:38:26,705
She's got her eye on you.

1406
01:38:28,610 --> 01:38:30,576
And that's her good one?

1407
01:38:34,311 --> 01:38:37,505
# Lay it down, child #

1408
01:38:37,645 --> 01:38:42,237
- # You can #
- # You can lay it down, child #

1409
01:38:42,311 --> 01:38:48,074
# And walk into this room #

1410
01:38:54,479 --> 01:38:56,570
I think this is gonna work.

1411
01:38:56,646 --> 01:38:58,578
Yeah?
Why is that?

1412
01:38:58,646 --> 01:39:01,078
- Because on an intimacy scale...
- Mm-hmm.

1413
01:39:01,145 --> 01:39:03,236
having somebody watch me
brush my teeth...

1414
01:39:03,312 --> 01:39:05,904
is right up there with seeing me
on a Sazerac swing...

1415
01:39:05,979 --> 01:39:08,069
and I'm not minding it.

1416
01:39:19,979 --> 01:39:22,878
Hmm?

1417
01:39:27,480 --> 01:39:30,413
This had better be good.

1418
01:39:30,481 --> 01:39:32,413
Oh--

1419
01:39:39,314 --> 01:39:43,246
Uh... I'll catch
the first flight out.

1420
01:40:08,249 --> 01:40:10,181
Mildred.

1421
01:40:29,249 --> 01:40:33,511
You don't know what it means to me,
for you to be here.

1422
01:40:38,249 --> 01:40:40,681
He was my first love.

1423
01:40:42,951 --> 01:40:44,883
And my last.

1424
01:40:44,951 --> 01:40:48,644
Next to Jack.

1425
01:40:48,718 --> 01:40:50,684
Did you know him?
Jack?

1426
01:40:53,684 --> 01:40:55,707
He was good for Mark.

1427
01:40:55,784 --> 01:41:00,114
Well, I would have liked
to have known him.

1428
01:41:02,685 --> 01:41:06,117
I guess you all thought
I couldn't handle it.

1429
01:41:09,818 --> 01:41:12,784
Until just a week ago...

1430
01:41:12,851 --> 01:41:16,875
I still harbored the fantasy that
you and he would get together again.

1431
01:41:20,419 --> 01:41:23,613
We had some nice talks
before he died.

1432
01:41:24,852 --> 01:41:27,410
I'm glad we had those talks.

1433
01:41:27,486 --> 01:41:32,111
I felt like his mother again.

1434
01:41:42,354 --> 01:41:45,615
I'll never know
everything about Mark...

1435
01:41:47,519 --> 01:41:50,974
but I know some things about him now
that I never knew before.

1436
01:41:51,053 --> 01:41:55,884
I don't think we need to know everything
about the people we love.

1437
01:42:08,654 --> 01:42:11,985
Yeah. Hello?

1438
01:42:12,055 --> 01:42:14,213
- Trent?
- Hey.

1439
01:42:14,288 --> 01:42:16,220
How are you?

1440
01:42:16,288 --> 01:42:18,220
I'm good.

1441
01:42:18,288 --> 01:42:20,720
I was, uh-- I was just calling in
for my messages.

1442
01:42:20,788 --> 01:42:22,720
What are you doing there?

1443
01:42:22,788 --> 01:42:25,049
Oh, I, uh--

1444
01:42:25,121 --> 01:42:27,212
I took Barley over to my house...

1445
01:42:27,288 --> 01:42:30,050
and I don't think he liked it.

1446
01:42:30,122 --> 01:42:32,816
Actually, I'm sure he didn't like it.
He peed all over my stuff.

1447
01:42:32,889 --> 01:42:37,218
So... I came back here.

1448
01:42:37,289 --> 01:42:39,551
I'm glad.

1449
01:42:40,622 --> 01:42:42,883
How was everything where you are?

1450
01:42:42,955 --> 01:42:46,548
In its own way,
it was quite beautiful.

1451
01:42:48,123 --> 01:42:51,146
- Trent?
- Yeah?

1452
01:42:53,390 --> 01:42:55,855
Is it too late to say,
"I love you"?

1453
01:42:55,923 --> 01:42:57,912
It's early.

1454
01:43:06,391 --> 01:43:08,323
She's coming back tomorrow.

1455
01:43:12,557 --> 01:43:17,286
And then sleeping arrangements
will definitely be revised.

1456
01:43:30,891 --> 01:43:32,880
Come over later.

1457
01:43:34,058 --> 01:43:36,819
I don't--
I don't know if I'm up to it.

1458
01:43:36,891 --> 01:43:38,880
Well, think about it, Mildred.

1459
01:43:38,959 --> 01:43:41,221
I'd love to have you there.

1460
01:43:41,292 --> 01:43:43,225
I'll think about it.

1461
01:44:21,561 --> 01:44:23,493
Mom?

1462
01:44:26,993 --> 01:44:30,323
- Mom?
- Yes, out here, Meredith.

1463
01:44:31,494 --> 01:44:33,586
Make three--

1464
01:44:33,662 --> 01:44:36,253
Three times as many seems reasonable.

1465
01:44:36,328 --> 01:44:39,089
- Hello, sweetheart.
- Hi. Hi.

1466
01:44:39,161 --> 01:44:43,184
That sister of yours was
supposed to be here an hour ago
to help me with all this.

1467
01:44:43,261 --> 01:44:47,250
And here she is,
looking fabulous I might add.

1468
01:44:47,328 --> 01:44:50,089
I'm so sorry I'm late.
What can I do?

1469
01:44:50,162 --> 01:44:54,356
You can put on a bra,
and then you can do everything else.

1470
01:44:54,429 --> 01:44:56,361
Oh, it's not like
you were any help.

1471
01:44:56,429 --> 01:44:58,361
- Why, you know my play was opening.
- I know.

1472
01:44:58,429 --> 01:45:01,861
That's right. Your father has the review
on the refrigerator already.

1473
01:45:01,929 --> 01:45:04,520
Mr. Crabby from the Times
gave it a rave. Congrats.

1474
01:45:04,595 --> 01:45:07,527
- You mean you read it?
- I'm proud of my younger sister.

1475
01:45:07,595 --> 01:45:11,358
Now to work. Believe it or not,
I have worn these fingers to a frazzle.

1476
01:45:11,429 --> 01:45:14,691
Speed dialing is so strenuous.
I've taken care of the caterers...

1477
01:45:14,763 --> 01:45:18,196
the flowers are being arranged
as we speak, and I've hired a minister.

1478
01:45:18,263 --> 01:45:21,660
You did tell him to go easy
on the God stuff, hmm?

1479
01:45:21,730 --> 01:45:23,696
Yes, Daddy.

1480
01:45:23,763 --> 01:45:26,355
Gracie, Gracie, Gracie.

1481
01:45:26,430 --> 01:45:29,022
The other bearded one
will barely get a mention.

1482
01:45:29,098 --> 01:45:31,030
All right.

1483
01:45:31,098 --> 01:45:33,359
Ah, my Meredith.

1484
01:45:36,297 --> 01:45:38,160
You know, we do have to change.

1485
01:45:38,230 --> 01:45:41,526
Well, if I have to wear a tux,
she has to wear a bra.

1486
01:45:41,597 --> 01:45:43,564
Inside.

1487
01:45:43,631 --> 01:45:46,153
- I never knew what happiness was until I married your mother...
- Just march.

1488
01:45:46,231 --> 01:45:48,356
and by then it was too late.

1489
01:45:48,431 --> 01:45:50,363
You are so--

1490
01:45:50,431 --> 01:45:53,693
Now, listen. I put you in a seat
next to Hugh and me because I figured...

1491
01:45:53,765 --> 01:45:55,697
you might be coming alone and--

1492
01:45:55,765 --> 01:45:59,288
Yeah, well, you might have to do
some rearranging because, um...

1493
01:45:59,365 --> 01:46:02,093
because I have a date.

1494
01:46:02,165 --> 01:46:03,994
We'll change fast.

1495
01:46:04,065 --> 01:46:07,361
You know
you're gonna tell me every single thing.

1496
01:46:12,632 --> 01:46:14,564
Mom, Dad...

1497
01:46:14,632 --> 01:46:16,393
this is Trent.

1498
01:46:16,466 --> 01:46:18,398
- Hi.
- It's a pleasure, Trent.

1499
01:46:18,466 --> 01:46:20,399
- It's a pleasure to meet you. Congratulations.
- Hello.

1500
01:46:20,467 --> 01:46:23,626
- Thank you.
- Hi. I'm the older married sister.

1501
01:46:23,699 --> 01:46:26,688
- Hi.
- Sorry. Gracie.

1502
01:46:26,766 --> 01:46:28,595
I see what you mean.
Okay, we better get started.

1503
01:46:28,666 --> 01:46:32,099
- We're 20 minutes behind
and the minister has another service.
- We can't go without Jo-Jo.

1504
01:46:32,166 --> 01:46:35,189
- Moi.
- Oh! Now we can.

1505
01:46:35,266 --> 01:46:37,199
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Mom, you look beautiful.

1506
01:46:37,267 --> 01:46:39,789
- Thank you. You're forgiven for being late.
- Thank you.

1507
01:46:39,867 --> 01:46:42,628
Dad, wow.

1508
01:46:42,700 --> 01:46:45,461
Forty years ago,
he wore jeans to our wedding.

1509
01:46:45,533 --> 01:46:47,465
You should have heard the fuss
he made this time...

1510
01:46:47,533 --> 01:46:49,465
when he found out
he had to wear a tux.

1511
01:46:49,533 --> 01:46:51,897
What an anger ball.

1512
01:46:51,967 --> 01:46:53,990
Oh, Mom, Dad, everybody...

1513
01:46:54,067 --> 01:46:56,761
- this is Keenan.
- How do you do, Keenan?

1514
01:46:56,835 --> 01:46:59,767
- Very good, sir.
- Good to meet you, Keenan.

1515
01:46:59,835 --> 01:47:02,892
- Nice to meet you.
- Champagne. Jo-Jo?

1516
01:47:02,968 --> 01:47:06,059
- Um... I'm okay.
- Oh.

1517
01:47:06,135 --> 01:47:09,067
Keenan and I are just gonna
have a couple Cokes or something.

1518
01:47:09,135 --> 01:47:13,397
Keenan, did I tell you
how very good it is to meet you?

1519
01:47:13,469 --> 01:47:16,230
Funny.

1520
01:47:21,632 --> 01:47:24,120
Hannah and Paul have asked
their family and friends...

1521
01:47:24,199 --> 01:47:27,632
to join them here today
in their home...

1522
01:47:27,699 --> 01:47:29,892
to reaffirm their wedding vows...

1523
01:47:29,965 --> 01:47:32,694
40 years since the first time.

1524
01:47:34,099 --> 01:47:36,031
#

1525
01:47:36,099 --> 01:47:38,122
What's this?
No applause?

1526
01:47:38,200 --> 01:47:42,894
Don't they realize what a miracle
40 years of marriage is?

1527
01:47:42,966 --> 01:47:46,160
Probably not, but I do.

1528
01:47:46,233 --> 01:47:49,223
#

1529
01:47:49,301 --> 01:47:51,529
Hannah and Paul,
you come here today...

1530
01:47:51,601 --> 01:47:55,033
to repledge your love,
your undying love.

1531
01:47:55,100 --> 01:47:57,532
A love that has lasted many years...

1532
01:47:57,601 --> 01:48:02,192
and will go on lasting, I'm certain,
many years more.

1533
01:48:02,267 --> 01:48:05,028
You stand here today
before God...

1534
01:48:05,100 --> 01:48:08,226
your family and friends
to celebrate...

1535
01:48:08,302 --> 01:48:11,325
to reaffirm your lasting love
for each other.

1536
01:48:11,402 --> 01:48:15,164
Hannah and Paul have asked
to keep the ceremony simple...

1537
01:48:15,235 --> 01:48:18,462
and to that end they each set
a challenge for the other:

1538
01:48:18,534 --> 01:48:22,990
to find a sentence that best describes
their feelings for the other.

1539
01:48:23,068 --> 01:48:25,728
Hannah? Paul?

1540
01:48:29,569 --> 01:48:32,933
You are the tenant of my heart...

1541
01:48:33,002 --> 01:48:36,399
often behind in the rent...

1542
01:48:36,468 --> 01:48:39,730
but impossible to evict.

1543
01:48:39,802 --> 01:48:42,826
If I had to do it all over again...

1544
01:48:42,903 --> 01:48:47,699
I wouldn't do it...
any different.

1545
01:48:57,570 --> 01:49:08,095
#

1546
01:49:30,638 --> 01:49:33,399
Mildred, I'm so sorry.

1547
01:49:33,471 --> 01:49:41,837
#

1548
01:49:45,139 --> 01:49:48,264
- So, that's who I stole your V.W. for, huh?
- Yeah.

1549
01:49:48,339 --> 01:49:51,532
Thank you.

1550
01:49:54,207 --> 01:49:57,661
- And you thought it wasn't gonna work out.
- Yeah.

1551
01:49:57,739 --> 01:50:02,001
#

1552
01:50:02,073 --> 01:50:04,470
That was really...
beautiful.

1553
01:50:05,873 --> 01:50:07,805
It was.

1554
01:50:09,339 --> 01:50:11,273
Yes, it was.

1555
01:50:15,974 --> 01:50:20,100
Think we'll be having
a fortieth wedding ceremony?

1556
01:50:24,041 --> 01:50:26,666
I don't know, Hugh.

1557
01:50:44,007 --> 01:50:45,940
Would you like to think so?

1558
01:50:48,542 --> 01:50:50,599
I don't know, Hugh.

1559
01:50:53,342 --> 01:50:55,501
- Hey.
- Hello.

1560
01:50:55,576 --> 01:50:58,007
Hi.

1561
01:50:58,075 --> 01:51:01,939
- How did you like that improv class?
- That was... interesting.

1562
01:51:02,008 --> 01:51:04,771
I think it's so cool to pretend to be
somebody else every night for a week.

1563
01:51:04,843 --> 01:51:06,775
I took it twice.

1564
01:51:08,210 --> 01:51:10,142
This is Keenan, by the way.

1565
01:51:10,210 --> 01:51:12,835
Hi. Hugh.
I'm, uh, married to Gracie here.

1566
01:51:12,909 --> 01:51:14,603
Hugh designs video games.

1567
01:51:14,676 --> 01:51:19,166
- Any I'd know?
- Um, "Killer Golf." That was the last.

1568
01:51:19,243 --> 01:51:21,106
Oh, man, that game was awesome.

1569
01:51:21,176 --> 01:51:23,870
You have a hell of an imagination.

1570
01:51:23,944 --> 01:51:26,569
Hey, you owe me a dance.

1571
01:51:26,643 --> 01:51:29,132
- Just one?
- No.

1572
01:51:38,543 --> 01:51:40,476
Gracie...

1573
01:51:42,444 --> 01:51:44,376
would you like to dance?

1574
01:51:44,444 --> 01:51:48,342
Yes. Yes, I would.

1575
01:51:50,744 --> 01:51:55,506
#

1576
01:51:55,578 --> 01:51:59,705
You know, I can't think
of a better way to meet your family.

1577
01:51:59,779 --> 01:52:02,336
Other than maybe dropping a bookshelf
on their heads.

1578
01:52:04,846 --> 01:52:07,209
#

1579
01:52:07,278 --> 01:52:09,437
They look so perfect together.

1580
01:52:09,512 --> 01:52:11,444
#

1581
01:52:11,512 --> 01:52:14,035
They look so perfect together.

1582
01:52:14,111 --> 01:52:16,078
Just like we do.

1583
01:52:16,146 --> 01:52:19,203
Ow!

1584
01:52:19,279 --> 01:52:24,302
Sorry. Now you know the real reason
why I like to dance alone.

1585
01:52:24,379 --> 01:52:28,812
It's okay.
You can step on my feet anytime.

1586
01:52:28,880 --> 01:52:32,437
Just, you know, next time I'll wear
some steel-toed shoes or something.

1587
01:52:34,514 --> 01:52:46,505
#

1588
01:52:51,281 --> 01:52:56,941
#

1589
01:52:57,014 --> 01:52:59,446
What are we thinking?

1590
01:52:59,515 --> 01:53:02,310
If only they knew
what we know.

1591
01:53:02,381 --> 01:53:05,904
Then it would be all too easy.

1592
01:53:05,981 --> 01:53:08,675
- The trumpet player--
- Hmm?

1593
01:53:08,748 --> 01:53:11,044
- Your friend?
- Yeah.

1594
01:53:11,115 --> 01:53:14,569
The one who said talking about love
is like dancing about architecture.

1595
01:53:14,648 --> 01:53:16,580
Mm-hmm.

1596
01:53:17,815 --> 01:53:21,179
Well, what do you say
we prove him wrong?

1597
01:53:21,249 --> 01:53:26,910
#

1598
01:53:26,983 --> 01:53:29,574
I think we already have.

1599
01:53:29,649 --> 01:53:42,879
#

1600
01:55:30,621 --> 01:55:33,884
#

1601
01:55:33,956 --> 01:55:35,945
# Don't let 'em get to your heart #

1602
01:55:39,188 --> 01:55:44,780
# They'll leave you damned and swimming
in a lake when it's only a garden #

1603
01:55:44,856 --> 01:55:49,380
# The whole wide world feels like
a shrine built to the worker bees #

1604
01:55:51,356 --> 01:55:54,947
# Who stole it from God anyhow #

1605
01:55:56,089 --> 01:55:59,919
# Lay it down, child #

1606
01:56:01,456 --> 01:56:04,388
# Lay it down, child #

1607
01:56:04,456 --> 01:56:10,356
# And walk into this room #

1608
01:56:13,756 --> 01:56:16,314
# Don't let 'em get to your spark #

1609
01:56:18,823 --> 01:56:22,312
# That little light in the back
of everything that sizzles #

1610
01:56:22,390 --> 01:56:24,720
# It's a full night of love #

1611
01:56:24,791 --> 01:56:28,053
# The whole wide world feels
like a clan of mad scientists #

1612
01:56:28,124 --> 01:56:31,113
# Removing the genes #

1613
01:56:31,191 --> 01:56:36,089
# So they can freeze-dry you
and put you in a box #

1614
01:56:36,158 --> 01:56:39,681
# Lay it down, child #

1615
01:56:41,424 --> 01:56:44,448
# Lay it down, child #

1616
01:56:44,525 --> 01:56:47,514
# And walk into this room #

1617
01:56:47,592 --> 01:56:52,184
# All made with love for you #

1618
01:56:52,258 --> 01:56:54,816
# Lay it down, child #

1619
01:56:54,892 --> 01:56:57,085
- # You can #
- # You can #

1620
01:56:57,159 --> 01:57:00,455
# Lay it down, child #

1621
01:57:00,526 --> 01:57:06,186
# And walk into this room #

1622
01:57:06,259 --> 01:57:09,384
# Oh #

1623
01:57:09,459 --> 01:57:13,050
# A hundred candles to make the walls #

1624
01:57:13,125 --> 01:57:15,057
# Come alive #

1625
01:57:15,125 --> 01:57:20,684
# A little frankincense
to soothe the air just right #

1626
01:57:20,760 --> 01:57:25,590
# Now take my hand #

1627
01:57:27,560 --> 01:57:33,459
- # And open the door #
- # And open the door #

1628
01:57:34,860 --> 01:57:37,191
# Oh, yeah #

1629
01:57:37,261 --> 01:57:40,091
# Oh #

1630
01:57:40,161 --> 01:57:43,321
# Oh, yeah #

1631
01:57:43,394 --> 01:57:46,326
# Oh #

1632
01:57:53,362 --> 01:57:56,157
# Lay it down, child #

1633
01:57:56,229 --> 01:57:58,252
- # You can #
- # You can #

1634
01:57:58,329 --> 01:58:01,056
# Lay it down, child #

1635
01:58:01,128 --> 01:58:03,060
# And walk #

1636
01:58:03,128 --> 01:58:08,583
# Into this room #

1637
01:58:11,896 --> 01:58:14,362
# Walk into this room #

1638
01:58:14,429 --> 01:58:19,362
- # Lay it down, child #
- # Just lay it down Lay it down #

1639
01:58:19,429 --> 01:58:21,987
# Lay it down #

1640
01:58:25,230 --> 01:58:27,752
# Lay it down
Lay it down #

1641
01:58:27,829 --> 01:58:30,819
# Into this room #

1642
01:58:40,064 --> 01:58:54,989
#
