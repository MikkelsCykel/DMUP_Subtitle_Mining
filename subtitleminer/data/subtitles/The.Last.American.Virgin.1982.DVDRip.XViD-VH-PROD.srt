1
00:00:16,029 --> 00:00:17,997
You sure you know
which ones go where?

2
00:00:18,031 --> 00:00:19,089
I'm sure, Gino.

3
00:00:19,132 --> 00:00:20,497
That's what
you told me yesterday.

4
00:00:20,534 --> 00:00:23,196
I ended up driving 12 anchovies
to a customer's house.

5
00:00:23,236 --> 00:00:24,863
That's 'cause of
your lousy handwriting.

6
00:00:24,905 --> 00:00:26,065
I can't read the address.

7
00:00:26,106 --> 00:00:27,767
You ought to spend
more time in school...

8
00:00:27,808 --> 00:00:29,901
instead of cruisin' around
with broads in my car.

9
00:00:29,943 --> 00:00:31,968
Then you'd learn how to read.

10
00:00:32,012 --> 00:00:33,502
Now come on, hurry up.

11
00:00:33,547 --> 00:00:35,242
And this time
bring the car back.

12
00:00:35,282 --> 00:00:36,909
Gino, you said
I could have it tonight.

13
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:38,315
What are you tryin' to do,
ruin me?

14
00:00:38,352 --> 00:00:40,115
I ain't in
the rent-a-car business.

15
00:00:40,153 --> 00:00:42,314
Let's go.
The pizzas are gettin' cold.

16
00:00:42,356 --> 00:00:44,347
And don't squish the boxes.

17
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,951
Be careful how you drive!

18
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:05,104
I'll take a rocky road.

19
00:02:05,138 --> 00:02:06,935
Pink bubble gum, please.

20
00:02:06,973 --> 00:02:08,201
Pink bubble gum?

21
00:02:08,241 --> 00:02:11,210
Yeah, it's the flavor
of the month.

22
00:02:20,153 --> 00:02:21,279
Rocky road.

23
00:02:21,321 --> 00:02:23,016
Oh, thank you.

24
00:02:28,628 --> 00:02:30,255
What do you want?

25
00:02:30,297 --> 00:02:32,162
A rocky road.

26
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,335
She's fine, isn't she?

27
00:02:38,371 --> 00:02:39,895
Yeah, do you know her?

28
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:42,602
Never saw her before
in my life.

29
00:02:47,314 --> 00:02:49,839
Hey. You know those
three chicks over there?

30
00:02:49,883 --> 00:02:51,077
- Where?
- Right there.

31
00:02:51,117 --> 00:02:53,347
You don't mean
those three alien creatures...

32
00:02:53,386 --> 00:02:54,683
sittin' over there, do you?

33
00:02:54,721 --> 00:02:57,485
David's just telling me
that they're easy lays.

34
00:02:57,524 --> 00:02:59,082
You're imagining easy lays.

35
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:00,820
I'm not imagining.
Listen, Gary...

36
00:03:00,861 --> 00:03:03,159
Tommy's brother screws
that blonde like he owns her.

37
00:03:03,196 --> 00:03:05,357
Bullshit. Will you look at 'em?
They're virgins.

38
00:03:05,398 --> 00:03:08,060
They're not. I can tell by
the way they walk. Right, Rick?

39
00:03:08,101 --> 00:03:09,728
That brunette ain't no virgin.

40
00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:11,703
Look at the way
she's suckin' on that straw.

41
00:03:11,738 --> 00:03:13,399
I'm wasting my time here.
Count me out.

42
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,603
Hey, cool it for a second, Gary.
This could be interesting.

43
00:03:16,643 --> 00:03:18,508
David, why don't you
walk over there...

44
00:03:18,545 --> 00:03:21,571
and invite the three ladies
back to our table?

45
00:03:21,615 --> 00:03:23,276
No problem.

46
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:39,296
Hi, girls.
How's it goin' tonight?

47
00:03:41,835 --> 00:03:43,860
Seriously,
will you count me out, Rick?

48
00:03:43,904 --> 00:03:45,599
Hey, do you want
to get laid or not?

49
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:47,470
I'd rather screw Godzilla
than them.

50
00:03:58,018 --> 00:03:59,815
Do you have the key
to your grandmother's house?

51
00:03:59,853 --> 00:04:03,152
No, but we can go to my house.
My parents went out.

52
00:04:03,189 --> 00:04:04,178
Perfect.

53
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:06,886
- Hi, ladies.
- Hi.

54
00:04:06,927 --> 00:04:08,258
Sit down.

55
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:21,334
I'm Rick.

56
00:04:21,374 --> 00:04:22,773
This is Gary.

57
00:04:22,809 --> 00:04:25,039
You've met the Big Apple.

58
00:04:25,078 --> 00:04:26,705
I'm Millie.

59
00:04:26,746 --> 00:04:28,043
I'm Roxanne.

60
00:04:28,081 --> 00:04:29,241
Hi, I'm Brenda.

61
00:04:29,282 --> 00:04:32,911
Let's not let the party
go on without us, girls.

62
00:04:32,953 --> 00:04:33,942
What party?

63
00:04:33,987 --> 00:04:36,751
The best party in town,
sweetheart.

64
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:38,223
Tell 'em about it, Gary.

65
00:04:41,061 --> 00:04:43,689
Yeah, it's gonna be great.

66
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:46,927
There's great music
and people, and...

67
00:04:46,967 --> 00:04:48,730
What about drugs?

68
00:04:48,768 --> 00:04:54,206
Well, we have uppers,
downers...

69
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,605
a little bit of smoke.

70
00:04:55,642 --> 00:04:57,735
All kinds, right guys?

71
00:04:57,777 --> 00:04:59,938
- What about coke?
- Yeah.

72
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:02,608
- Coke?
- Yeah.

73
00:05:02,649 --> 00:05:04,446
Yeah, lots of coke.

74
00:05:04,484 --> 00:05:06,042
Of course.

75
00:05:06,086 --> 00:05:09,988
Yeah, we have a whole big...
plenty of coke.

76
00:05:12,359 --> 00:05:14,486
Well, what do you say, ladies?

77
00:05:14,527 --> 00:05:15,994
No. I say no.

78
00:05:16,029 --> 00:05:18,224
- Told you they were hot to trot.
- Shut up.

79
00:05:18,264 --> 00:05:20,061
OK.

80
00:05:21,935 --> 00:05:23,459
OK, what's the verdict, girls?

81
00:05:24,771 --> 00:05:28,002
Well, as long as you keep
your hands to yourselves...

82
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:29,975
and get us home by 12:00.

83
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:31,375
A quarter till 12:00.

84
00:05:31,411 --> 00:05:33,379
You know I have to be home
at a quarter till 12:00.

85
00:05:33,413 --> 00:05:35,040
You guys fight later.

86
00:05:35,081 --> 00:05:37,242
We have a party
to go to, right?

87
00:05:37,283 --> 00:05:38,875
Yeah!

88
00:06:02,075 --> 00:06:04,066
Step right in, ladies.

89
00:06:05,178 --> 00:06:06,805
Relax, the place is ours.

90
00:06:06,846 --> 00:06:09,212
Gary's parents are out of town.

91
00:06:09,249 --> 00:06:11,410
Everybody
make yourselves at home.

92
00:06:17,123 --> 00:06:19,023
Where is everybody?

93
00:06:19,059 --> 00:06:21,550
- They should be here any minute.
- Yeah, they're on their way.

94
00:06:21,594 --> 00:06:22,891
I don't like this.

95
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,798
Would you like to dance?

96
00:06:29,836 --> 00:06:31,167
OK.

97
00:06:36,076 --> 00:06:38,203
How about you?
Would you like to dance?

98
00:06:38,244 --> 00:06:40,405
Oh, yeah, sure.

99
00:06:50,023 --> 00:06:51,354
Gary.

100
00:07:09,309 --> 00:07:10,936
You know,
you're a great dancer.

101
00:07:10,977 --> 00:07:12,035
Yeah, I know.

102
00:07:13,513 --> 00:07:16,710
- Would you like to dance?
- I really don't care.

103
00:07:18,818 --> 00:07:21,184
Well, you don't care yes...

104
00:07:21,221 --> 00:07:22,813
or you don't care no?

105
00:07:22,856 --> 00:07:24,847
It doesn't make
any difference.

106
00:07:29,696 --> 00:07:32,688
So, what do you say
we dance?

107
00:07:34,134 --> 00:07:35,863
I don't care.

108
00:07:42,442 --> 00:07:45,240
What do you think
about this song?

109
00:07:45,278 --> 00:07:48,611
I really don't care.

110
00:07:48,648 --> 00:07:50,616
What do you care about?

111
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:53,346
Listen, don't start
that small talk with me.

112
00:07:53,386 --> 00:07:55,320
It's not gonna help you anyway.

113
00:07:55,355 --> 00:07:57,414
You're not gonna get
anything from me.

114
00:07:57,457 --> 00:08:01,120
- Listen, I didn't...
- I really don't care.

115
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:05,925
Please don't, Rick.

116
00:08:05,965 --> 00:08:07,455
Please.

117
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,660
Stop.

118
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,360
Please stop.

119
00:08:22,949 --> 00:08:23,938
Rick.

120
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,648
- I think maybe we should go.
- No.

121
00:08:29,689 --> 00:08:31,680
We don't even know
where we are.

122
00:08:36,462 --> 00:08:38,157
So...

123
00:08:38,198 --> 00:08:39,688
What about the drugs?

124
00:08:42,302 --> 00:08:44,133
What about the drugs?

125
00:08:45,572 --> 00:08:47,233
What about the drugs?

126
00:08:49,008 --> 00:08:51,067
They're in the kitchen.

127
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:52,907
They're in the kitchen.

128
00:08:52,946 --> 00:08:54,174
They're in the kitchen.

129
00:08:54,214 --> 00:08:56,648
- They're in the kitchen.
- Yeah.

130
00:08:56,683 --> 00:08:59,447
So you girls sit tight,
and we'll be right back.

131
00:08:59,485 --> 00:09:02,147
You better think
of something quick.

132
00:09:02,188 --> 00:09:04,816
Why the hell did you have
to promise 'em drugs?

133
00:09:04,858 --> 00:09:06,189
Because that's
what they wanted.

134
00:09:06,226 --> 00:09:08,091
You shouldn't have
promised them anything.

135
00:09:08,127 --> 00:09:09,651
If I didn't promise
them something...

136
00:09:09,696 --> 00:09:10,890
they would've
never come, right?

137
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:12,397
What are we supposed
to do now?

138
00:09:12,432 --> 00:09:15,060
Wait a second.
You got any Sweet'N Low?

139
00:09:19,339 --> 00:09:22,502
Here we are, girls.
The best stuff in town.

140
00:09:22,542 --> 00:09:24,169
Yeah, fresh from Peru.

141
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:26,474
And crispy chips.

142
00:09:26,512 --> 00:09:29,174
One hit, and you'll be flyin'.

143
00:09:42,762 --> 00:09:45,595
Really good stuff!

144
00:09:45,632 --> 00:09:47,224
Great.

145
00:09:57,844 --> 00:09:59,209
I love it.

146
00:10:29,008 --> 00:10:32,034
This is the best Colombian
I've ever had.

147
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:34,842
- Want another line?
- You mean, like, now?

148
00:10:34,881 --> 00:10:35,848
Yeah.

149
00:10:35,882 --> 00:10:38,646
- No, no.
- No, thanks a lot.

150
00:10:38,685 --> 00:10:39,743
Good stuff, huh?

151
00:10:39,786 --> 00:10:40,912
Yeah.

152
00:10:59,973 --> 00:11:03,101
Hey, Brenda. Can I talk to you
inside for a second?

153
00:11:03,142 --> 00:11:05,508
Oh, yeah, sure.

154
00:11:09,415 --> 00:11:11,474
Gee, it's sort of dark in here.

155
00:11:11,517 --> 00:11:14,213
Yeah, I guess the bulb
kinda burnt itself out.

156
00:11:14,253 --> 00:11:16,244
Sit down.

157
00:11:18,257 --> 00:11:21,124
So, what did you want
to talk to me about?

158
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,354
You know.

159
00:11:22,395 --> 00:11:23,794
I know what?

160
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:25,457
You know.

161
00:11:25,498 --> 00:11:27,193
You sorta like me, huh?

162
00:11:27,233 --> 00:11:28,393
Yeah.

163
00:11:31,304 --> 00:11:33,534
You got white stuff
all over your nose.

164
00:11:33,573 --> 00:11:35,803
- So do you.
- I do.

165
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,601
This coke is kinda sweet.

166
00:11:39,645 --> 00:11:41,704
It's really good stuff.

167
00:11:41,748 --> 00:11:43,545
Yeah, the best.

168
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:45,710
David, what are you doing?!

169
00:11:48,287 --> 00:11:50,448
Excuse me.

170
00:12:03,369 --> 00:12:05,360
Let's take our business
elsewhere.

171
00:12:05,405 --> 00:12:06,702
OK.

172
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,808
Now, you two have fun.

173
00:12:31,864 --> 00:12:33,058
Do you want a chip?

174
00:12:33,099 --> 00:12:34,430
Thank you.

175
00:12:53,953 --> 00:12:55,784
David, please don't.

176
00:12:55,822 --> 00:12:58,154
Look, I don't wanna
take my blouse off.

177
00:12:58,191 --> 00:12:59,783
I just met you tonight.

178
00:12:59,826 --> 00:13:01,726
But what about
Roxanne and Millie?

179
00:13:01,761 --> 00:13:03,058
What about them?

180
00:13:03,096 --> 00:13:05,257
They don't seem
to be having any problems.

181
00:13:16,909 --> 00:13:18,968
But I'm not on the pill.

182
00:13:19,011 --> 00:13:20,342
Me, neither.

183
00:13:39,132 --> 00:13:40,827
The patio?

184
00:13:40,867 --> 00:13:44,860
Yeah, go out on the patio
and count to 100...

185
00:13:44,904 --> 00:13:48,601
and when you're finished,
I'll be already undressed.

186
00:13:49,876 --> 00:13:51,605
Undressed?

187
00:13:51,644 --> 00:13:53,805
In bed.

188
00:13:53,846 --> 00:13:55,404
You sure?

189
00:13:55,448 --> 00:13:57,507
I'm sure.

190
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:59,745
I'll be on the patio.

191
00:13:59,785 --> 00:14:01,116
OK.

192
00:14:03,789 --> 00:14:05,586
I'll be countin'.

193
00:14:08,327 --> 00:14:10,761
One, two, three...

194
00:14:10,796 --> 00:14:13,196
four, five, six...

195
00:14:13,232 --> 00:14:15,826
seven, eight, nine...

196
00:14:15,868 --> 00:14:18,302
ten, eleven, twelve...

197
00:14:18,337 --> 00:14:20,703
thirteen, fourteen...

198
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:40,256
- Would you like a chip?
- What?

199
00:14:40,293 --> 00:14:42,352
A chip... would you like one?

200
00:14:42,395 --> 00:14:44,056
No, thanks.

201
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:20,426
It really was.
You were wonderful.

202
00:15:20,466 --> 00:15:22,525
Gary, are you home?

203
00:15:22,568 --> 00:15:25,093
What the hell
is going on here?

204
00:15:25,137 --> 00:15:28,766
Hal, I think your son should
explain what's going on here.

205
00:15:28,808 --> 00:15:31,038
Gary, what the hell
is going on here?

206
00:15:31,077 --> 00:15:32,271
Millie?

207
00:15:34,046 --> 00:15:36,310
I'd like you
to meet my parents.

208
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:39,682
Pop...

209
00:15:39,719 --> 00:15:41,016
Millie.

210
00:15:41,053 --> 00:15:42,315
Hi.

211
00:15:42,355 --> 00:15:43,379
Hi.

212
00:15:45,124 --> 00:15:48,787
Oh, my God!
I'm having a heart attack!

213
00:15:50,396 --> 00:15:53,388
Hal! Just don't stand there!

214
00:15:53,432 --> 00:15:55,593
I want these tramps
out of here!

215
00:15:55,635 --> 00:15:56,761
Gary, get them out of here.

216
00:15:56,802 --> 00:15:59,202
Millie, can I borrow
your breath spray?

217
00:15:59,238 --> 00:16:01,138
I'm dying!

218
00:16:02,608 --> 00:16:03,973
I'm dying.

219
00:16:08,814 --> 00:16:10,281
Hurry up!

220
00:16:12,251 --> 00:16:14,116
All right. Where to now?

221
00:16:14,153 --> 00:16:15,780
I think we should
just call it a night.

222
00:16:15,821 --> 00:16:17,652
No, come on,
let's go to the beach!

223
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:19,749
Wait a minute. Where's David?

224
00:16:19,792 --> 00:16:21,760
This is terrible.

225
00:16:21,794 --> 00:16:23,762
I want you to lay down.

226
00:16:23,796 --> 00:16:26,697
- Lay down and rest.
- All right. I will.

227
00:16:26,732 --> 00:16:30,259
Please just do me a favor.
Just please go...

228
00:16:30,303 --> 00:16:34,672
and get me two aspirin
and some water, please.

229
00:16:34,707 --> 00:16:36,607
And then close the door.

230
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:40,178
Oh, what a mess.

231
00:16:40,212 --> 00:16:42,976
96, 97, 98...

232
00:16:43,015 --> 00:16:45,540
99, 100.

233
00:17:06,706 --> 00:17:08,640
Not now, Hal.

234
00:17:08,674 --> 00:17:10,335
Hal?

235
00:17:10,376 --> 00:17:12,435
Mrs. Spencer,
what are you doing here?

236
00:17:12,478 --> 00:17:14,571
What am I doing here?
What are you doing here?!

237
00:17:14,613 --> 00:17:16,478
Oh, Hal!

238
00:17:16,515 --> 00:17:19,609
I brought you a couple of...

239
00:17:19,652 --> 00:17:21,051
Mr. Spencer!

240
00:17:21,087 --> 00:17:22,554
What the hell
is going on here?!

241
00:17:22,588 --> 00:17:25,352
You don't understand.
She told me to go outside, and...

242
00:17:25,391 --> 00:17:27,484
I did not!
He tried to rape me!

243
00:17:27,526 --> 00:17:28,788
- Rape?!
- No! No!

244
00:17:28,828 --> 00:17:31,058
Get out of my house!
Get out of my house!

245
00:17:34,533 --> 00:17:38,629
You pervert!
Get out of my house!

246
00:17:38,671 --> 00:17:40,036
Shame on you!

247
00:17:40,072 --> 00:17:42,165
Here he comes!

248
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:43,334
David!

249
00:17:43,376 --> 00:17:44,843
Come on, David!

250
00:17:44,877 --> 00:17:47,004
You're in your
fucking underwear!

251
00:17:49,281 --> 00:17:51,579
- Hey, guys, you know something?
- What?

252
00:17:51,617 --> 00:17:53,107
Your parents are home.

253
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:52,934
Victor!

254
00:18:52,978 --> 00:18:54,809
What are you doin', Victor?

255
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:59,147
Looks like we've got ourselves
a peeping tom, guys!

256
00:18:59,185 --> 00:19:01,210
I wasn't peeping.

257
00:19:01,253 --> 00:19:02,880
I was just...

258
00:19:02,922 --> 00:19:04,412
I was just looking
at the board.

259
00:19:04,457 --> 00:19:07,017
Sure.

260
00:19:07,059 --> 00:19:09,289
Victor's got himself
a hard-on.

261
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:13,496
What are you hiding, Victor?

262
00:19:13,532 --> 00:19:14,760
It's none of your business.

263
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,358
Buzz off, blimp.

264
00:19:16,402 --> 00:19:19,166
OK, OK, come on, guys.
Let's lay off him.

265
00:19:19,205 --> 00:19:21,833
I mean, it's too small
to see, anyway, right?

266
00:19:21,874 --> 00:19:25,867
Oh, yeah? I just bet you guys
wish you had what I have.

267
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,145
Bullshit, Victor.

268
00:19:30,182 --> 00:19:32,844
Put your money
where your mouth is.

269
00:19:32,885 --> 00:19:34,182
Money? Now he's talkin'.

270
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,984
All right, listen up, guys.
Everybody put in a buck...

271
00:19:37,022 --> 00:19:39,217
and the man who's got
the biggest tool...

272
00:19:39,258 --> 00:19:41,590
he's the one
who wins the pool.

273
00:19:54,139 --> 00:19:55,663
3 and 1/2.

274
00:19:59,178 --> 00:20:01,203
Rick is here!

275
00:20:07,286 --> 00:20:09,345
Holy shit.

276
00:20:09,388 --> 00:20:10,446
It's alive!

277
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:13,285
Jesus Christ.

278
00:20:15,861 --> 00:20:17,226
That's nine inches.

279
00:20:17,263 --> 00:20:19,322
Nine? Who are you
trying to cheat?

280
00:20:19,365 --> 00:20:21,299
It's 9 and 1/2.
Measure it again.

281
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:23,198
We're not including
your balls, Victor.

282
00:20:23,235 --> 00:20:26,864
Neither am I. Look, it's mine.
I should know what it is.

283
00:20:26,906 --> 00:20:28,897
OK, you want to give him
the extra 1/2 inch?

284
00:20:28,941 --> 00:20:30,875
9 and 1/2 for Victor!

285
00:20:40,819 --> 00:20:42,787
One, two, three, four.

286
00:20:42,821 --> 00:20:44,550
Thank you.

287
00:20:48,594 --> 00:20:50,459
- Hey, Gary.
- Hi.

288
00:20:53,232 --> 00:20:54,859
Don't strain your eyeballs.

289
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,800
Hey, you know who she is?

290
00:20:56,835 --> 00:20:58,097
Which one?

291
00:20:58,137 --> 00:20:59,798
The one with the purple streak
in her hair?

292
00:20:59,838 --> 00:21:01,533
No, the other one, turkey.

293
00:21:01,574 --> 00:21:04,236
- I think her name is Karen.
- Karen what?

294
00:21:04,276 --> 00:21:07,404
I don't know. She just
moved here about a week ago.

295
00:21:07,446 --> 00:21:09,573
Can you find out
where she lives?

296
00:21:09,615 --> 00:21:11,242
Sure, no sweat.

297
00:21:11,283 --> 00:21:14,446
For a small fee,
I think I can find out.

298
00:22:29,728 --> 00:22:31,855
- Good morning.
- Oh, morning.

299
00:22:31,897 --> 00:22:33,694
Is something wrong?

300
00:22:33,732 --> 00:22:35,256
I'm not sure.

301
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,097
Well, let me have a look.

302
00:22:42,408 --> 00:22:44,273
Looks like you have a flat.

303
00:22:44,309 --> 00:22:45,776
Can it be fixed?

304
00:22:45,811 --> 00:22:47,039
I don't know.

305
00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:49,604
You must have run over
some small glass or something.

306
00:22:49,648 --> 00:22:52,310
- Do you have a pump?
- No.

307
00:22:52,351 --> 00:22:54,512
Oh, darn, I'm gonna
be late for school.

308
00:22:54,553 --> 00:22:57,386
- Can I give you a lift?
- Which way are you going?

309
00:22:57,423 --> 00:22:59,550
- To Roosevelt High.
- So am I!

310
00:22:59,591 --> 00:23:02,219
- So be my guest.
- OK.

311
00:23:06,765 --> 00:23:08,824
Can I offer you some pizza?

312
00:23:08,867 --> 00:23:10,300
No, thank you.

313
00:23:10,335 --> 00:23:12,064
How about a big
meatball sandwich?

314
00:23:12,104 --> 00:23:14,732
No, thanks.
I just had breakfast.

315
00:23:14,773 --> 00:23:16,502
What's your name?

316
00:23:16,542 --> 00:23:17,839
Karen.

317
00:23:17,876 --> 00:23:19,707
- Sharon?
- Karen.

318
00:23:19,745 --> 00:23:21,576
Marion?

319
00:23:21,613 --> 00:23:22,978
Karen... with a ''K. ''

320
00:23:23,015 --> 00:23:25,540
Oh, ''Karen. ''
Why didn't you say so?

321
00:23:25,584 --> 00:23:26,642
I just did.

322
00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:35,288
Thanks for the ride.

323
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:39,390
Bye.

324
00:23:42,301 --> 00:23:44,292
Karen! Hold on a second.

325
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,907
I wanted to ask what
you were doing tonight.

326
00:23:50,943 --> 00:23:52,535
I'm afraid I'm busy.

327
00:23:52,578 --> 00:23:54,808
Oh. That's too bad.

328
00:23:54,847 --> 00:23:58,010
Because I know about this
really happening party tonight.

329
00:23:58,050 --> 00:24:01,281
Sorry. There's always
a next time.

330
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,753
Thanks again, Gary.

331
00:24:04,256 --> 00:24:05,382
Karen!

332
00:24:06,892 --> 00:24:09,019
Let me ask you
something straight out.

333
00:24:09,061 --> 00:24:11,120
Go ahead.

334
00:24:14,099 --> 00:24:16,590
Do you have a boyfriend?

335
00:24:16,635 --> 00:24:17,897
No.

336
00:24:17,936 --> 00:24:19,062
Well...

337
00:24:19,104 --> 00:24:21,095
Thanks again, Gary.

338
00:24:23,509 --> 00:24:24,737
Come on, move!

339
00:24:24,777 --> 00:24:26,972
That's it, get that lead
out of your ass.

340
00:24:27,012 --> 00:24:28,240
One, two, three!

341
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:35,409
Hey, shake it.

342
00:24:55,674 --> 00:24:57,141
Hey, Big Apple,
what's going on?

343
00:24:57,176 --> 00:24:59,974
- Gary, where have you been?
- My parents. Don't ask.

344
00:25:00,012 --> 00:25:02,207
Don't worry about it.
You came at the perfect time.

345
00:25:02,247 --> 00:25:04,078
The place is really jumping.

346
00:25:04,116 --> 00:25:05,549
Hey, give me a cigarette.

347
00:25:05,584 --> 00:25:08,485
- Come on, I only have nine left.
- Put it on my bill.

348
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,715
Jesus Christ.
You know, you guys.

349
00:25:10,756 --> 00:25:12,690
Hey, Gary, guess who's here?

350
00:25:12,724 --> 00:25:14,885
- Who?
- Karen.

351
00:25:14,927 --> 00:25:16,918
She's right over there
dancing with Rick.

352
00:25:21,166 --> 00:25:24,499
It doesn't take old lover boy
very long, does it?

353
00:25:24,536 --> 00:25:26,470
He's on her like flies to shit.

354
00:25:36,849 --> 00:25:39,818
Come on, you might as well
just forget about her.

355
00:25:39,852 --> 00:25:42,719
Maybe he'll give you
sloppy seconds.

356
00:25:54,299 --> 00:25:55,926
My pleasure, madam.

357
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:57,595
Oh, mine, too.

358
00:25:57,636 --> 00:26:01,197
I want you to meet
my two very best friends.

359
00:26:01,306 --> 00:26:03,706
Gary, David,
how you guys doing?

360
00:26:03,742 --> 00:26:07,007
Listen, I want you to meet
the love of my life.

361
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,738
Gary, this is...

362
00:26:09,781 --> 00:26:11,715
- Hi, Karen.
- Hi, Gary.

363
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:14,218
So you two have met before?

364
00:26:14,253 --> 00:26:17,051
Yeah, I guess
you can say that.

365
00:26:17,089 --> 00:26:19,057
Karen, hi, there you are.

366
00:26:19,091 --> 00:26:20,888
I've been looking
for you all night.

367
00:26:20,926 --> 00:26:22,393
Oh, hi, Rose.

368
00:26:22,427 --> 00:26:24,258
Rose, this is Rick.

369
00:26:25,597 --> 00:26:28,896
And this is Gary.

370
00:26:28,934 --> 00:26:30,424
Hi, Gary.

371
00:26:30,469 --> 00:26:32,801
Oh. Hi, Rose.

372
00:26:32,838 --> 00:26:34,897
All right,
let's cut this shit...

373
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:37,602
and now let's all get serious.

374
00:26:39,478 --> 00:26:41,105
May I have this dance,
princess?

375
00:26:41,146 --> 00:26:42,272
Sure.

376
00:27:12,077 --> 00:27:14,204
Would you like to dance, Gary?

377
00:27:14,246 --> 00:27:15,713
Let's dance.

378
00:27:15,747 --> 00:27:17,044
Rose, I don't know...

379
00:27:17,082 --> 00:27:18,743
Come on, dance with me.

380
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:27,458
You and Rose
are pretty tight, huh?

381
00:27:27,492 --> 00:27:29,892
I guess. Why?

382
00:27:29,928 --> 00:27:33,386
It looks like she's a little bit
more than hot for Gary.

383
00:27:33,432 --> 00:27:35,992
I think it would be great
if they hit it off.

384
00:27:36,034 --> 00:27:37,592
Have we done that?

385
00:27:37,636 --> 00:27:39,831
Done what?

386
00:27:39,871 --> 00:27:41,930
Hit it off.

387
00:27:54,019 --> 00:27:56,749
I really love this song.

388
00:27:56,788 --> 00:28:00,884
This song just drives me crazy.

389
00:28:00,926 --> 00:28:03,622
Yeah, it's great.

390
00:28:03,662 --> 00:28:05,630
Will you excuse me
for one minute?

391
00:28:05,664 --> 00:28:06,722
Sure.

392
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:17,402
Excuse me.
I'll be back in a minute.

393
00:28:19,044 --> 00:28:20,204
May I?

394
00:28:20,245 --> 00:28:21,610
Cool.

395
00:28:21,646 --> 00:28:23,580
Looking real foxy tonight.

396
00:28:36,628 --> 00:28:40,325
What's the matter with you?
Are you drunk?

397
00:28:40,365 --> 00:28:43,528
Not yet.
I'm just getting started.

398
00:28:43,568 --> 00:28:45,900
Well, seems like you're off
to a pretty good start.

399
00:28:45,937 --> 00:28:47,404
The night's still young.

400
00:28:47,439 --> 00:28:50,203
I'm just getting ready
for the good part.

401
00:28:50,242 --> 00:28:52,904
Hey, do you want some?

402
00:28:52,944 --> 00:28:54,935
Oh, no thanks. I'll pass.

403
00:28:57,282 --> 00:29:00,774
How's about a big
meatball sandwich, huh?

404
00:29:03,722 --> 00:29:06,850
You and Rick are
pretty good friends, aren't you?

405
00:29:06,892 --> 00:29:11,192
Yeah. We're partners,
you know? Tight.

406
00:29:11,229 --> 00:29:14,687
You sure like him, don't you?

407
00:29:14,733 --> 00:29:16,462
Why do you ask?

408
00:29:16,501 --> 00:29:19,902
I don't know.
I just felt like asking.

409
00:29:19,938 --> 00:29:24,204
Hey, there you are,
my beautiful baby.

410
00:29:24,242 --> 00:29:26,574
I was looking all over for you.

411
00:29:26,611 --> 00:29:29,205
Well, I was just
talking to Gary.

412
00:29:29,247 --> 00:29:33,377
Gary. I think you better
lighten up on that stuff, man.

413
00:29:33,418 --> 00:29:35,249
It'll turn your brain to shit.

414
00:30:07,252 --> 00:30:09,550
Hey, man, take it easy!

415
00:30:09,588 --> 00:30:12,022
Watch it, jerk!

416
00:30:12,057 --> 00:30:13,217
Gary.

417
00:30:13,258 --> 00:30:15,123
Hey, you're
fucking wrecked, man.

418
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,821
Get it together.

419
00:30:16,862 --> 00:30:19,092
David, will you
take care of him, please?

420
00:30:19,131 --> 00:30:20,325
We got a freak-out
on our hands.

421
00:30:20,365 --> 00:30:23,300
Come on, Gary, it's me... David.

422
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:27,803
What's the matter
with you, man?

423
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:29,602
Hi, David.

424
00:30:29,641 --> 00:30:31,768
You're ruining it
for everybody.

425
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:34,176
Come on, let's take him
out by the pool.

426
00:30:34,212 --> 00:30:36,510
No, I don't want to go.

427
00:30:36,548 --> 00:30:39,016
No, I don't want to go.

428
00:30:46,525 --> 00:30:50,655
Listen, I want you to go home,
get a good night's sleep...

429
00:30:50,695 --> 00:30:52,856
and in the morning
you'll feel 100%% % better.

430
00:30:52,898 --> 00:30:54,297
Thanks, pal.

431
00:30:54,332 --> 00:30:56,960
Look, you go on.
Go on. I'll be all right.

432
00:30:57,002 --> 00:31:00,062
Are you sure you don't want me
to drive you home?

433
00:31:00,105 --> 00:31:03,905
You're gonna get my seats wet,
and my boss is gonna kill me.

434
00:31:03,942 --> 00:31:06,240
Get in the car, come on.

435
00:31:06,278 --> 00:31:08,371
- David?
- What?

436
00:31:08,413 --> 00:31:10,381
Are you going back
to the party?

437
00:31:10,415 --> 00:31:12,747
Of course, what do you think?

438
00:31:12,784 --> 00:31:15,252
Give her my best, will you?

439
00:31:15,287 --> 00:31:16,584
To who?

440
00:31:16,621 --> 00:31:18,748
To her... Karen.

441
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:21,918
Oh, Karen, of course.
Yeah. Come on, get in.

442
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:26,260
David, make sure to tell her
I love her madly.

443
00:31:26,298 --> 00:31:30,325
OK, I'll tell her your love
for her is highly spiritual.

444
00:31:30,368 --> 00:31:32,302
OK? Now come on.

445
00:31:32,337 --> 00:31:33,804
Thanks.

446
00:31:33,838 --> 00:31:35,066
No problem.

447
00:31:35,106 --> 00:31:36,573
Don't forget.

448
00:31:36,608 --> 00:31:37,597
I won't.

449
00:31:37,642 --> 00:31:38,973
Just be careful, all right?

450
00:31:44,783 --> 00:31:46,478
Gary?

451
00:31:46,518 --> 00:31:47,917
Yeah?

452
00:31:47,953 --> 00:31:49,147
Why don't you come in...

453
00:31:49,187 --> 00:31:51,212
and introduce yourself
to our guests?

454
00:31:51,256 --> 00:31:52,348
OK.

455
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:54,585
You'll never get over
how much he's grown...

456
00:31:54,626 --> 00:31:57,026
since the last time
you've seen him.

457
00:31:57,062 --> 00:31:58,222
Hi, everybody!

458
00:31:58,263 --> 00:32:00,390
Gary!

459
00:32:00,432 --> 00:32:06,462
Oh, my goodness, Martha,
how this young man has grown!

460
00:32:06,504 --> 00:32:09,496
Are you in high school
already, Gary?

461
00:32:13,278 --> 00:32:18,079
Gary, Mrs. Roswell
is asking you a question.

462
00:32:19,484 --> 00:32:22,885
Oh, I am so sorry.

463
00:32:22,921 --> 00:32:25,219
He hasn't been
feeling well lately.

464
00:32:25,257 --> 00:32:29,853
What this young man needs
is a long, cold shower.

465
00:32:29,894 --> 00:32:31,259
Oh, yeah?

466
00:32:31,296 --> 00:32:33,696
Only if you join me, baby.

467
00:32:33,732 --> 00:32:36,633
'Cause I know what you need.

468
00:32:37,869 --> 00:32:39,268
Good night, Gary.

469
00:32:39,304 --> 00:32:42,205
Gary, I want you to take this
tray back into the kitchen...

470
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,105
and then go to your room!

471
00:32:44,142 --> 00:32:45,769
Good night, Gary.

472
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:48,244
Good night, everybody!

473
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,305
Good night, Gary!

474
00:32:57,222 --> 00:33:00,214
Good night, Mrs. Roswell.

475
00:33:00,258 --> 00:33:02,590
Good night, Gary.

476
00:33:02,627 --> 00:33:06,063
Good night, My Mrs. Roswell

477
00:33:06,097 --> 00:33:09,396
Good night, my love

478
00:33:09,434 --> 00:33:13,632
Sleep tight, my Mrs. Roswell

479
00:33:13,672 --> 00:33:16,300
Sleep tight, my love

480
00:33:16,341 --> 00:33:17,933
Good night

481
00:33:19,177 --> 00:33:20,906
No, please, nobody get up.

482
00:33:20,945 --> 00:33:22,674
We'll clean it up
in the morning.

483
00:33:22,881 --> 00:33:26,248
An isosceles is a triangle
which has two equal sides.

484
00:33:26,284 --> 00:33:29,185
A scalene is a triangle
with no equal sides...

485
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:30,847
like so.

486
00:33:30,889 --> 00:33:34,450
We have A, B, C.

487
00:33:34,492 --> 00:33:39,156
Now, let's review
yesterday's problem on page 74.

488
00:33:39,197 --> 00:33:41,757
What did we say about
the relationship...

489
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:46,328
between two squares
bisected by lines...

490
00:33:46,371 --> 00:33:49,101
both horizontal and vertical?

491
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,835
Gary?

492
00:33:52,377 --> 00:33:53,366
Gary!

493
00:33:55,647 --> 00:33:57,114
Yes?

494
00:33:57,148 --> 00:33:59,776
Gary, please stand up
and illustrate the theory.

495
00:34:05,757 --> 00:34:07,019
Well...

496
00:34:07,058 --> 00:34:08,548
Gary, please answer.

497
00:34:08,593 --> 00:34:10,390
See, it's really very simple.

498
00:34:10,428 --> 00:34:11,656
You...

499
00:34:11,696 --> 00:34:13,721
Take the side that's longest.

500
00:34:13,765 --> 00:34:15,733
You take the side
that's longest.

501
00:34:15,767 --> 00:34:18,463
- And then...
- And what?

502
00:34:18,503 --> 00:34:20,266
And then you...

503
00:34:22,974 --> 00:34:25,340
And then BC.

504
00:34:25,377 --> 00:34:26,742
And then BC...

505
00:34:26,778 --> 00:34:28,712
you know, the lines cross.

506
00:34:28,747 --> 00:34:30,408
And then?

507
00:34:30,448 --> 00:34:33,349
And then you... sorry.

508
00:34:33,385 --> 00:34:36,980
- And then?
- And then...

509
00:34:37,021 --> 00:34:39,251
and then...

510
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:40,757
and then...

511
00:34:42,827 --> 00:34:45,159
And then you shove it
up your ass.

512
00:35:15,727 --> 00:35:18,787
Un momentita... I'm coming.

513
00:35:20,765 --> 00:35:22,096
Pizza delivery.

514
00:35:22,133 --> 00:35:23,930
Ah, my pizza.

515
00:35:23,968 --> 00:35:25,833
Come on in, chico.

516
00:35:31,576 --> 00:35:36,775
Carmela is pleased to see
such a beautiful delivery.

517
00:35:38,316 --> 00:35:41,581
Where should I put these?

518
00:35:41,619 --> 00:35:44,383
Why don't you put the pizza
in the kitchen.

519
00:35:44,422 --> 00:35:45,719
Over there?

520
00:35:45,757 --> 00:35:48,658
And put the bottles
in the fridge.

521
00:35:48,693 --> 00:35:49,682
OK.

522
00:35:51,029 --> 00:35:53,623
How much do you charge,
my little pizza boy?

523
00:35:53,665 --> 00:35:55,963
It's $7.50 for the pizza...

524
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,458
and $1.50 for the drinks.

525
00:35:59,504 --> 00:36:01,233
It's nine bucks.

526
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:05,207
Jesus, lady, I'm s...

527
00:36:05,243 --> 00:36:07,609
I'm sorry. It slipped.

528
00:36:08,947 --> 00:36:10,471
Here, let me clean it up.

529
00:36:10,515 --> 00:36:13,006
Don't worry, it's nothing.

530
00:36:13,051 --> 00:36:15,815
Could've happened to anyone.

531
00:36:21,626 --> 00:36:25,153
Taste it. It's good?

532
00:36:28,066 --> 00:36:31,763
It's papaya. Don't you like it?

533
00:36:31,803 --> 00:36:33,236
I do.

534
00:36:33,271 --> 00:36:37,105
It's very good, ma'am.

535
00:36:37,141 --> 00:36:39,837
You can call me Carmela.

536
00:36:41,279 --> 00:36:44,737
Don't worry,
Carmela does not bite...

537
00:36:44,782 --> 00:36:47,444
nice, young muchachos.

538
00:36:47,485 --> 00:36:51,717
That's my boss. I gotta go.
I have to go call him.

539
00:36:51,756 --> 00:36:54,725
You must come back
when you have more time.

540
00:36:54,759 --> 00:36:56,351
Hey, the money!

541
00:36:56,394 --> 00:36:58,954
Hey, that's OK. So long!

542
00:36:58,997 --> 00:37:01,727
Come back whenever you like!

543
00:37:42,941 --> 00:37:46,468
Oh, it's my little muchacho.

544
00:37:46,511 --> 00:37:48,240
Back so soon.

545
00:37:48,279 --> 00:37:51,248
Hi. Me and my friends...

546
00:37:51,282 --> 00:37:53,079
we just happened to be
in the neighborhood.

547
00:37:53,117 --> 00:37:55,278
And I thought we'd bring you
some extra pizzas.

548
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:58,881
Oh, you're friends
of my muchacho?

549
00:37:58,923 --> 00:38:01,118
Good, good,
we have a pizza party.

550
00:38:01,159 --> 00:38:02,421
Come in.

551
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:10,033
Yeah, go.

552
00:38:24,949 --> 00:38:27,645
Don't be shy, muchachos.

553
00:38:27,685 --> 00:38:29,744
Please sit down.

554
00:38:33,124 --> 00:38:36,651
Now I will get you
a little drinkito.

555
00:38:43,067 --> 00:38:44,432
Sit down.

556
00:38:44,469 --> 00:38:47,097
You weren't bullshitting.
She is totally hot!

557
00:38:47,138 --> 00:38:48,765
Yeah, tell me about it.

558
00:38:48,806 --> 00:38:50,774
You sure this isn't
going to cost us?

559
00:38:50,808 --> 00:38:54,767
I'm positive.
She does it 'cause she loves it.

560
00:38:57,148 --> 00:38:59,616
If I had known
you were coming...

561
00:38:59,651 --> 00:39:03,519
I would have had
everything just right.

562
00:39:03,554 --> 00:39:07,388
Lucky for us my darling
sailor boy Paco...

563
00:39:07,425 --> 00:39:09,723
left me this bottle of tequila.

564
00:39:21,572 --> 00:39:22,800
Amor.

565
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,034
Amor?

566
00:39:24,075 --> 00:39:25,906
To love.

567
00:39:37,388 --> 00:39:39,754
Let's have some music.

568
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:50,533
Go ahead,
she's waiting for you.

569
00:39:50,568 --> 00:39:52,866
You go.
You're her little muchacho.

570
00:39:52,904 --> 00:39:55,372
Cut the shit. You saw the way
she was looking at you.

571
00:39:55,406 --> 00:39:56,668
Now, go!

572
00:41:18,089 --> 00:41:20,057
Come...

573
00:41:20,091 --> 00:41:22,116
and dance with Carmela.

574
00:42:24,288 --> 00:42:26,279
Get your clothes off.

575
00:42:28,793 --> 00:42:29,987
What are you doing?

576
00:42:30,027 --> 00:42:32,689
Come on, he said
to take our clothes off.

577
00:42:38,536 --> 00:42:41,130
Oh, sí, sí, sí, sí.

578
00:43:04,262 --> 00:43:06,230
Move... let me have a look.

579
00:43:06,264 --> 00:43:08,528
Come on, I gotta look.

580
00:43:08,566 --> 00:43:12,730
Oh, you are so long,
my sweet papaya.

581
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:17,400
You are driving Carmela crazy!

582
00:43:17,441 --> 00:43:21,070
- Come on, I gotta see!
- Shut up! Shut up!

583
00:43:21,112 --> 00:43:22,909
- Oh, God.
- What?

584
00:43:22,947 --> 00:43:24,209
I don't believe this.

585
00:43:24,248 --> 00:43:28,446
More! More!
That's it! Harder!

586
00:43:28,486 --> 00:43:30,784
Yes! Yes!

587
00:43:30,821 --> 00:43:32,254
More! More!

588
00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:34,383
Gary, I can't stand it.
I gotta look.

589
00:43:34,425 --> 00:43:35,449
Wait, no.

590
00:43:38,429 --> 00:43:40,260
Mama! Mama!

591
00:43:40,298 --> 00:43:41,458
Papa!

592
00:43:44,635 --> 00:43:46,535
My angel.

593
00:43:46,570 --> 00:43:49,095
I am ready! I am ready!

594
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:51,267
Jesus Christ, he's fucking her.

595
00:43:51,309 --> 00:43:53,106
He's fucking her!

596
00:43:53,144 --> 00:43:54,975
They're finished.
Here he comes.

597
00:43:58,582 --> 00:44:03,212
Who is the next muchacho
for Carmela?

598
00:44:03,254 --> 00:44:05,484
Go to it, Gary.
She's waiting for you, man.

599
00:44:05,523 --> 00:44:06,547
David's next.

600
00:44:06,590 --> 00:44:08,717
No, you said
you wanted seconds.

601
00:44:08,759 --> 00:44:11,284
Come on, David, you said
you were going after Rick.

602
00:44:11,329 --> 00:44:12,728
Now, go ahead.

603
00:44:12,763 --> 00:44:14,958
I am starting to feel Ionely.

604
00:44:14,999 --> 00:44:17,991
- Rick, I'll tell you why...
- Get in there.

605
00:44:20,604 --> 00:44:22,902
Rick, tell me, how was it?

606
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:25,170
It was great, man.

607
00:44:25,209 --> 00:44:27,143
Hi.

608
00:44:27,178 --> 00:44:30,306
Come to me, my big burrito.

609
00:44:30,348 --> 00:44:31,747
Me?

610
00:44:31,782 --> 00:44:33,773
You are the only man I see.

611
00:44:33,818 --> 00:44:34,978
You sure?

612
00:44:35,019 --> 00:44:38,955
Oh, yes. Come to Carmela.

613
00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:41,015
Hurry up. Come on.

614
00:44:41,058 --> 00:44:43,253
Hurry up.

615
00:44:43,294 --> 00:44:48,095
Carmela wants to feel you.

616
00:44:49,467 --> 00:44:53,028
Carmela wants you to feel good.

617
00:44:59,777 --> 00:45:01,210
Take this off.

618
00:45:01,312 --> 00:45:02,711
What?

619
00:45:02,747 --> 00:45:04,180
Take it off.

620
00:45:06,884 --> 00:45:08,044
Don't be shy.

621
00:45:09,587 --> 00:45:11,145
That's it.

622
00:45:13,257 --> 00:45:14,690
Bueno.

623
00:45:19,597 --> 00:45:21,827
She's going for it.
She's totally going for it.

624
00:45:21,866 --> 00:45:23,959
Let me see.

625
00:45:51,062 --> 00:45:52,324
Here she comes!

626
00:45:54,065 --> 00:45:56,761
Intermission.

627
00:45:56,801 --> 00:46:01,204
I just love a good fiesta.

628
00:46:01,305 --> 00:46:03,330
Let's have some more music.

629
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:11,509
Who is it?

630
00:46:13,584 --> 00:46:15,609
- Paco!
- Carmela.

631
00:46:15,653 --> 00:46:16,847
Oh, shit!

632
00:46:16,887 --> 00:46:19,014
Hurry! Get your clothes on.

633
00:46:19,056 --> 00:46:20,614
Mi amor.

634
00:46:20,658 --> 00:46:23,024
- Mi corazón.
- Hi!

635
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:24,687
Mi vida.

636
00:46:24,728 --> 00:46:27,322
Get your shirt on!
Come on, man!

637
00:46:28,899 --> 00:46:31,424
This is my sailor Paco.

638
00:46:31,469 --> 00:46:34,302
He's arriving from Puerto Rico
to visit Carmela.

639
00:46:34,338 --> 00:46:36,238
Isn't he good?

640
00:46:36,273 --> 00:46:38,901
These are my neighbor boys
from downstairs.

641
00:46:38,943 --> 00:46:41,935
I was helping them
with their Spanish lessons.

642
00:46:41,979 --> 00:46:45,107
That is all for today, boys.
You can go now.

643
00:46:45,149 --> 00:46:46,480
Adiós, muchachos.

644
00:46:48,652 --> 00:46:49,983
What a nympho.

645
00:46:58,162 --> 00:47:00,130
David's still inside!

646
00:47:00,164 --> 00:47:02,394
David, come on! Hurry up!

647
00:47:04,235 --> 00:47:05,793
Shit, my clothes!

648
00:47:07,805 --> 00:47:09,102
Come on, David!

649
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:10,607
Come on,
you're not gonna make it!

650
00:47:10,641 --> 00:47:12,074
Come on, man, hurry up!

651
00:47:12,109 --> 00:47:13,269
Shit!

652
00:47:26,457 --> 00:47:27,788
Come back here!

653
00:47:30,127 --> 00:47:31,059
Come back!

654
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:37,360
Hey, Rick.

655
00:47:37,401 --> 00:47:39,096
Hi, what's happening?

656
00:47:39,136 --> 00:47:40,660
Where's the car?

657
00:47:40,704 --> 00:47:44,868
I couldn't get it tonight.
My boss wouldn't let me have it.

658
00:47:44,909 --> 00:47:46,877
Are you serious?
Gary, you're crazy, man.

659
00:47:46,911 --> 00:47:48,811
Karen and Rose
are gonna be here any second.

660
00:47:48,846 --> 00:47:50,973
I told you to count me out
in the first place.

661
00:47:51,015 --> 00:47:54,212
You're supposed to be my buddy,
help me out tonight, remember?

662
00:47:54,251 --> 00:47:55,980
And you know that Karen
won't hang out with me...

663
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:57,385
unless Rose comes along.

664
00:47:57,421 --> 00:47:59,412
Besides, she's got
the hots for you, man.

665
00:47:59,456 --> 00:48:01,924
Oh, gee. Thanks a lot.

666
00:48:06,363 --> 00:48:08,263
Hey, guys. How's it goin'?

667
00:48:08,299 --> 00:48:11,564
- It's not so great, Victor.
- What's the problem?

668
00:48:14,305 --> 00:48:16,603
Well, you see, Victor,
Gary and I...

669
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:20,906
we invited these three
real hot blondes here tonight.

670
00:48:20,945 --> 00:48:24,847
But the thing is,
we got the rum...

671
00:48:24,882 --> 00:48:27,248
we got the chicks...

672
00:48:27,284 --> 00:48:29,184
but there's only two of us.

673
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:30,482
We need another guy.

674
00:48:30,521 --> 00:48:33,354
Hey, I'll give you a hand.

675
00:48:33,390 --> 00:48:35,688
Aw, no, Victor, really.

676
00:48:35,726 --> 00:48:37,591
No, no, no. No problem.

677
00:48:37,628 --> 00:48:38,788
Look, Victor, no.

678
00:48:38,829 --> 00:48:40,490
If there's any problem at all.

679
00:48:40,531 --> 00:48:41,828
We don't want
to inconvenience you.

680
00:48:41,865 --> 00:48:45,062
Hey, no, it's no inconvenience.
I'd like to.

681
00:48:45,102 --> 00:48:49,232
I mean,
what are friends for, right?

682
00:48:49,273 --> 00:48:52,538
Right. Now, Victor,
I'll park your car...

683
00:48:52,576 --> 00:48:55,443
and you go inside and get
some coke for the rum, OK?

684
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,643
Well...

685
00:48:58,682 --> 00:49:01,674
Come on, what do you say?
Look, it's gettin' late.

686
00:49:01,719 --> 00:49:04,187
Yeah, I don't know.

687
00:49:04,221 --> 00:49:05,415
Well...

688
00:49:07,224 --> 00:49:09,556
OK. All right.

689
00:49:09,593 --> 00:49:11,891
But you guys, really...

690
00:49:11,929 --> 00:49:14,056
park this beauty gently.

691
00:49:14,098 --> 00:49:16,430
- Oh, we will, Victor.
- I just got her painted.

692
00:49:16,467 --> 00:49:17,593
Looks great.

693
00:49:17,635 --> 00:49:19,535
Yeah, it cost me my last buck.

694
00:49:19,570 --> 00:49:21,936
And be careful
with your cigarette.

695
00:49:21,972 --> 00:49:23,963
- No problem.
- Oh, good.

696
00:49:25,376 --> 00:49:26,570
Three blondes?

697
00:49:26,610 --> 00:49:28,441
Three!

698
00:49:28,479 --> 00:49:31,141
Great.

699
00:49:31,181 --> 00:49:32,671
Great.

700
00:49:44,228 --> 00:49:46,059
- Get in the back.
- No way.

701
00:49:46,096 --> 00:49:47,427
Hey, how you doing?

702
00:49:47,464 --> 00:49:48,556
Hi, Gary.

703
00:49:52,403 --> 00:49:54,303
All right.

704
00:49:54,338 --> 00:49:56,431
So, what do you guys
want to to do tonight?

705
00:49:56,473 --> 00:49:57,701
I don't know.

706
00:49:57,741 --> 00:50:00,471
- Why don't we go to the point?
- Hey, that's a great idea!

707
00:50:00,511 --> 00:50:03,605
Oh, God! I've never been
to the point before.

708
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:06,639
That sounds like
a lot of fun! Yeah!

709
00:50:21,799 --> 00:50:24,768
Rose, do you have any mints
or gum or something?

710
00:50:24,802 --> 00:50:27,066
I only have two pieces left...

711
00:50:27,104 --> 00:50:29,197
and that has to last me
all night.

712
00:50:29,239 --> 00:50:33,767
Rose, how'd you like to sit
up front with Gary?

713
00:50:33,811 --> 00:50:35,642
Sure.

714
00:52:03,867 --> 00:52:05,858
Assholes.

715
00:52:09,273 --> 00:52:10,740
Gary, wait up!

716
00:52:10,774 --> 00:52:13,208
I'll see you in a couple.

717
00:52:14,711 --> 00:52:17,839
Listen, Gary, I gotta
ask you a small favor.

718
00:52:17,881 --> 00:52:19,974
Can you lend me the key
to your grandmother's tonight?

719
00:52:20,017 --> 00:52:21,109
What for?

720
00:52:21,151 --> 00:52:24,120
I got a date with Karen,
and I want to be alone.

721
00:52:24,154 --> 00:52:25,883
Yeah, well, I don't...

722
00:52:25,923 --> 00:52:29,518
Listen, Gary.
This is really important to me.

723
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:32,927
Tonight could really be
the big night, you know?

724
00:52:32,963 --> 00:52:34,260
Yeah.

725
00:52:34,298 --> 00:52:36,266
OK, I'll give you
the key tonight.

726
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:39,792
All right! Thanks a lot, man.
I owe you one, OK?

727
00:52:52,316 --> 00:52:53,715
Here he comes.

728
00:52:54,952 --> 00:52:56,419
Hey, what's shakin', guys?

729
00:52:56,453 --> 00:52:57,750
How's it goin', Rick?

730
00:52:57,788 --> 00:52:59,255
Hi, what's happening?

731
00:52:59,289 --> 00:53:01,780
You know what's happening.
Let me have it.

732
00:53:01,825 --> 00:53:02,985
Let you have what?

733
00:53:03,026 --> 00:53:04,789
What do you mean,
''Let me have what''?

734
00:53:04,828 --> 00:53:06,625
I believe we talked
about a key...

735
00:53:06,663 --> 00:53:08,096
to somebody's
grandmother's house.

736
00:53:08,131 --> 00:53:11,396
Oh, that. Look, Rick...

737
00:53:11,435 --> 00:53:13,630
I looked all over for it.
I couldn't find it.

738
00:53:13,670 --> 00:53:16,833
- Didn't we look for it, David?
- We couldn't find it anywhere.

739
00:53:16,874 --> 00:53:18,967
Well, that's great.
Thanks for telling me on time.

740
00:53:19,009 --> 00:53:20,704
Now what am I supposed to do?

741
00:53:20,744 --> 00:53:22,803
David, what about
your parents' guest house?

742
00:53:22,846 --> 00:53:24,837
No way. That's been off limits
since Big Earl...

743
00:53:24,882 --> 00:53:27,373
smoked angel dust
and he ate my mom's parakeet.

744
00:53:27,417 --> 00:53:29,647
I'll be cool.
All I need is an hour with her.

745
00:53:29,686 --> 00:53:31,176
Sorry, man.
I wish I could help you.

746
00:53:31,221 --> 00:53:33,689
Guess you'll just have
to call it off, Rick.

747
00:53:33,724 --> 00:53:35,191
Come on, David, let's go.

748
00:53:35,225 --> 00:53:37,159
What are you guys
in such a rush to do?

749
00:53:37,194 --> 00:53:39,628
There's a lady that's
just waitin' to lay us.

750
00:53:39,663 --> 00:53:42,223
- Oh, yeah? Who?
- The redhead.

751
00:53:42,266 --> 00:53:44,393
The one that Tommy's brother's
been screwing.

752
00:53:44,434 --> 00:53:47,028
- The one with the big tits?
- That's right, pal.

753
00:53:47,070 --> 00:53:49,561
We've been doing business
with her now for a while.

754
00:53:49,606 --> 00:53:50,903
Nine times already.

755
00:53:50,941 --> 00:53:53,637
You guys have screwed her
nine times...

756
00:53:53,677 --> 00:53:55,304
and you haven't even told me?

757
00:53:55,345 --> 00:53:57,142
We can't even talk
to you anymore.

758
00:53:57,180 --> 00:53:59,375
I mean, it's Karen this
and Karen that.

759
00:53:59,416 --> 00:54:01,543
You're too busy teeny-boppin'
all over the place.

760
00:54:01,585 --> 00:54:04,145
I thought you guys
were my friends.

761
00:54:04,187 --> 00:54:08,146
OK, we're asking you now, Rick.
You're comin' or you're not?

762
00:54:08,191 --> 00:54:11,592
How can I, Gary? I got a date
with Karen right now.

763
00:54:11,628 --> 00:54:13,061
There you go again.

764
00:54:13,096 --> 00:54:14,927
Come on, David, let's go.

765
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:19,132
You just go
and play house with Karen.

766
00:54:25,542 --> 00:54:28,067
Wait up, you guys.

767
00:54:39,323 --> 00:54:41,291
So, what's the story, fellas?

768
00:54:41,325 --> 00:54:43,657
Do I have anything you want?

769
00:54:46,597 --> 00:54:48,224
Make up your mind, honey.

770
00:54:48,265 --> 00:54:51,234
You better go home before
your mother starts to miss you.

771
00:54:51,268 --> 00:54:52,826
Look, I don't know about this.

772
00:54:52,869 --> 00:54:55,895
Hey, wait a minute.
Are we gonna get laid or not?

773
00:54:55,939 --> 00:54:59,033
Money, guys, or Ruby walks.

774
00:54:59,076 --> 00:55:00,907
Well, how much
are we talkin' about?

775
00:55:00,944 --> 00:55:03,208
30 bucks is the goin' rate.

776
00:55:03,246 --> 00:55:05,111
Are we on or not?
What do you say?

777
00:55:05,148 --> 00:55:08,606
30 bucks? That's 10 apiece.
I think we can handle that.

778
00:55:08,652 --> 00:55:11,587
That's 30 bucks apiece, guys,
and it ain't negotiable, see?

779
00:55:11,622 --> 00:55:12,987
Jesus, that's 90 bucks!

780
00:55:13,023 --> 00:55:14,957
No, I can't afford that.
No way.

781
00:55:14,992 --> 00:55:18,428
Stop wastin' my time.
Take it or leave it.

782
00:55:18,462 --> 00:55:20,089
How about 75?

783
00:55:20,130 --> 00:55:22,098
How about goin' home to mama?

784
00:55:22,132 --> 00:55:24,623
OK, all right, hold on.

785
00:55:24,668 --> 00:55:27,068
Go ahead. Come on.

786
00:55:27,104 --> 00:55:30,699
Hey, man, I am workin' here,
and you are killin' my action.

787
00:55:37,514 --> 00:55:39,379
Come on, guys. Time is money.

788
00:55:39,416 --> 00:55:40,815
We ain't got all night.

789
00:55:40,851 --> 00:55:44,184
I'll show you a good time,
but let's move it. Come on.

790
00:55:44,221 --> 00:55:46,553
Move your fat ass.

791
00:55:46,590 --> 00:55:48,421
All right, cowboys,
who's first?

792
00:55:48,458 --> 00:55:50,358
I want to get this over with.

793
00:55:50,394 --> 00:55:52,089
Go ahead, Gary. You go first.

794
00:55:52,129 --> 00:55:54,927
Go on, Gary. Go on.

795
00:55:54,965 --> 00:55:56,592
Go.

796
00:55:56,633 --> 00:55:58,658
Come on.
This is my busiest night.

797
00:55:58,702 --> 00:56:00,693
Let's get it on.

798
00:56:03,206 --> 00:56:05,037
Come on, move it. Please?

799
00:56:17,487 --> 00:56:19,352
Come on,
let's get those pants off.

800
00:56:19,389 --> 00:56:21,687
We haven't got all night.

801
00:56:21,725 --> 00:56:24,853
You move like you don't want
to get laid.

802
00:56:31,935 --> 00:56:34,369
Look at that.

803
00:56:34,404 --> 00:56:35,598
What's the matter?

804
00:56:35,639 --> 00:56:37,573
You ain't still a virgin,
are you?

805
00:56:40,077 --> 00:56:42,170
Come on.

806
00:56:42,212 --> 00:56:44,043
Come over here.

807
00:56:53,390 --> 00:56:54,550
There.

808
00:56:56,526 --> 00:56:58,357
There, that's got it.

809
00:56:58,395 --> 00:57:01,626
Yeah, that's a lot better.

810
00:57:01,665 --> 00:57:03,826
Now it's wide awake.

811
00:57:06,203 --> 00:57:08,194
Now we can do business.

812
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:11,800
Come on.

813
00:57:19,082 --> 00:57:21,073
Hurry up. Come on.

814
00:57:24,321 --> 00:57:26,050
No, dummy. Not there.

815
00:57:26,089 --> 00:57:28,683
Move up a little.

816
00:57:28,725 --> 00:57:31,091
There you go. OK, now.

817
00:57:31,128 --> 00:57:33,119
I wonder what's
taking him so long.

818
00:57:33,163 --> 00:57:36,132
Well, he might as well get
his thirty bucks worth, right?

819
00:57:36,166 --> 00:57:38,293
I think you mean my 30 bucks.

820
00:57:38,335 --> 00:57:40,667
Shit, move your ass.

821
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:45,330
Shit.

822
00:57:47,077 --> 00:57:48,772
My goddamn luck.

823
00:57:48,812 --> 00:57:50,803
I get all the live ones.

824
00:57:52,616 --> 00:57:56,074
You've still got a lot to learn,
little boy, you know?

825
00:58:01,324 --> 00:58:04,521
Well, come on, fat-ass.
You're next.

826
00:58:05,595 --> 00:58:06,823
How was it?

827
00:58:06,863 --> 00:58:08,296
Go ahead, David.

828
00:58:08,331 --> 00:58:10,322
Go on, man. Go ahead.

829
00:58:16,206 --> 00:58:17,639
Hey, what's wrong?

830
00:58:27,484 --> 00:58:30,009
Hi, how's it going?

831
00:58:30,053 --> 00:58:32,021
It could be better.

832
00:58:32,055 --> 00:58:34,683
Cigarette?

833
00:58:34,724 --> 00:58:36,385
I have my own.

834
00:58:38,662 --> 00:58:40,254
Busy day for you today, huh?

835
00:58:40,297 --> 00:58:42,697
Are you here to interview me
or to fuck me?

836
00:58:54,077 --> 00:58:58,138
For this examination, you will
have exactly twenty minutes.

837
00:58:59,349 --> 00:59:03,149
I will expect silence,
absolute silence.

838
00:59:03,186 --> 00:59:05,154
There will be no...

839
00:59:05,188 --> 00:59:06,849
You're late again.

840
00:59:06,890 --> 00:59:09,290
There's no excuse
for this kind of behavior.

841
00:59:09,326 --> 00:59:11,556
I'm sorry, Mrs. Applebaum.

842
00:59:11,595 --> 00:59:13,927
I didn't sleep
'cause I haven't...

843
00:59:13,964 --> 00:59:16,159
I haven't been
feeling too well.

844
00:59:16,199 --> 00:59:19,498
Very well.
Go to your seat.

845
00:59:21,104 --> 00:59:22,765
And no talking.

846
00:59:28,311 --> 00:59:29,642
Begin.

847
00:59:32,698 --> 00:59:34,563
Rick.

848
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:39,128
Rick! Shit.

849
00:59:39,171 --> 00:59:42,538
Rick! I can't stop itching!

850
00:59:42,575 --> 00:59:44,736
Me, too. It's driving me crazy.

851
00:59:44,777 --> 00:59:46,972
I know!

852
00:59:47,013 --> 00:59:48,640
What about David?

853
00:59:50,983 --> 00:59:52,245
Get David.

854
00:59:55,554 --> 00:59:58,182
- How do you feel?
- My balls are burning up.

855
00:59:58,224 --> 01:00:00,454
I know. Gary's, too.

856
01:00:00,493 --> 01:00:04,327
David, I'm dying. It hurts.

857
01:00:04,363 --> 01:00:05,853
I know.
I can't take it anymore.

858
01:00:05,898 --> 01:00:07,957
- What is it?
- I think I know.

859
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,831
Gary! David! Richard!

860
01:00:09,869 --> 01:00:11,302
Out of this classroom at once.

861
01:00:11,337 --> 01:00:15,239
I warned you. Out!

862
01:00:19,412 --> 01:00:21,710
Report to the principal's
office right now.

863
01:00:25,685 --> 01:00:26,947
And close the door!

864
01:00:26,986 --> 01:00:28,317
Yes, ma'am.

865
01:00:31,824 --> 01:00:33,189
- Crabs?!
- Crabs?!

866
01:00:33,225 --> 01:00:35,216
Crabs! You know,
like head lice.

867
01:00:35,261 --> 01:00:37,058
What the hell
can we do about them?

868
01:00:37,096 --> 01:00:38,063
Please!

869
01:00:38,097 --> 01:00:39,257
Don't worry about it.

870
01:00:39,298 --> 01:00:42,165
I know a way we can get
rid of them like that.

871
01:00:42,201 --> 01:00:45,227
- You sure this will drown them?
- Positive.

872
01:00:45,271 --> 01:00:47,364
But I thought crabs
loved the water.

873
01:00:47,406 --> 01:00:49,101
Not this kind.

874
01:00:49,141 --> 01:00:51,336
- Yeah? How do you know?
- I know!

875
01:00:51,377 --> 01:00:53,845
Tommy had 'em and drowned them
in his parents' jacuzzi.

876
01:00:53,879 --> 01:00:55,904
It sure takes long enough
to kill these suckers.

877
01:00:55,948 --> 01:00:58,280
Do you know we've been
in here for four hours now?!

878
01:00:58,317 --> 01:01:00,182
Yeah, my back is already baked.

879
01:01:00,219 --> 01:01:02,084
Yeah, well, stop itching,
lover boys.

880
01:01:02,121 --> 01:01:03,554
If you two
remember correctly...

881
01:01:03,589 --> 01:01:06,285
you're the ones
that got me into this.

882
01:01:06,325 --> 01:01:08,486
Hey, guys, look who's here.

883
01:01:11,630 --> 01:01:13,063
Hi, Gary.

884
01:01:13,099 --> 01:01:15,192
Hi.

885
01:01:15,234 --> 01:01:16,724
What happened to you
last night?

886
01:01:16,769 --> 01:01:18,703
I waited till 11:00 for you.

887
01:01:18,738 --> 01:01:21,036
What happened to me?
What happened to you?!

888
01:01:21,073 --> 01:01:23,769
I called you
at least ten times.

889
01:01:23,809 --> 01:01:25,367
My phone didn't ring once.

890
01:01:25,411 --> 01:01:28,574
You're kidding!
You better get it checked, then.

891
01:01:28,614 --> 01:01:30,206
I was worried about you, Karen.

892
01:01:30,249 --> 01:01:32,877
We're gonna get some sun.
Are you staying here?

893
01:01:32,918 --> 01:01:34,886
Yeah, go ahead.
I'll be right with you.

894
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:37,616
Come on.

895
01:01:37,656 --> 01:01:39,851
OK, that should do it.
Let's go.

896
01:01:44,163 --> 01:01:47,257
Rick, would you mind putting
some suntan lotion on my back?

897
01:01:47,299 --> 01:01:48,288
Sure.

898
01:01:48,334 --> 01:01:49,767
Gary?

899
01:01:49,802 --> 01:01:51,736
Yeah?

900
01:01:51,771 --> 01:01:55,502
Would you mind putting
some lotion on my back, too?

901
01:01:55,541 --> 01:01:56,667
Please?

902
01:01:56,709 --> 01:01:58,040
Fine.

903
01:01:58,077 --> 01:01:59,408
Thank you.

904
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:03,844
What's been happening
in your life?

905
01:02:03,883 --> 01:02:07,148
Not a whole
hell of a lot, Rose.

906
01:02:17,830 --> 01:02:19,798
How's the pizza world?

907
01:02:19,832 --> 01:02:21,629
It's round, Rose.

908
01:02:22,802 --> 01:02:25,999
- What's wrong?
- They didn't drown!

909
01:02:28,474 --> 01:02:29,634
I'll see you later.

910
01:02:29,675 --> 01:02:31,108
I'll be right back.

911
01:02:31,143 --> 01:02:33,202
Hey, what's your hurry?

912
01:02:33,245 --> 01:02:35,577
Hey! Who didn't drown?

913
01:02:39,051 --> 01:02:41,713
I need something...

914
01:02:41,754 --> 01:02:43,517
to kill ticks.

915
01:02:43,556 --> 01:02:46,423
Oh, no problem.
What kind of a dog do you have?

916
01:02:46,459 --> 01:02:50,987
A collie, but it's not for him.

917
01:02:51,030 --> 01:02:54,193
I'm afraid I don't know
what you mean.

918
01:02:54,233 --> 01:02:56,827
It's not really ticks.

919
01:02:56,869 --> 01:02:58,928
Not ticks?

920
01:02:58,971 --> 01:03:02,634
Uh-uh. It's...

921
01:03:02,675 --> 01:03:07,510
it's more like... lice.

922
01:03:07,546 --> 01:03:09,207
Oh, lice.

923
01:03:09,248 --> 01:03:11,512
Well, I've got
just the thing for you.

924
01:03:11,550 --> 01:03:14,485
I've got a special comb...

925
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:17,648
and it does very nicely
in these sort of things.

926
01:03:17,690 --> 01:03:20,250
You'll find it
very, very efficient.

927
01:03:20,292 --> 01:03:21,953
No.

928
01:03:21,994 --> 01:03:24,485
- No?
- See...

929
01:03:24,530 --> 01:03:28,364
it's not exactly lice, either.

930
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:30,595
It's...

931
01:03:30,636 --> 01:03:33,537
Well, you see,
it itches a lot.

932
01:03:33,572 --> 01:03:35,403
Let me take a look
at your head here.

933
01:03:35,441 --> 01:03:38,171
I don't see anything
wrong with that.

934
01:03:38,210 --> 01:03:41,509
Did you ever have any
allergy problems or anything?

935
01:03:41,547 --> 01:03:45,745
No. It's not on my head.

936
01:03:45,784 --> 01:03:47,081
So where is it?

937
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:49,110
It's...

938
01:03:51,790 --> 01:03:56,250
it's down there.

939
01:04:02,368 --> 01:04:05,064
Your balls itch?

940
01:04:11,510 --> 01:04:14,809
Crabs! At your age!

941
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:19,375
Young people... not what
they used to be in my...

942
01:04:19,418 --> 01:04:24,481
Don't worry about it.
I got just the thing for you.

943
01:04:24,523 --> 01:04:30,291
If you'll take this and apply it
three times a day...

944
01:04:30,329 --> 01:04:33,025
those little things'll
go away in no time.

945
01:04:33,065 --> 01:04:34,032
Thank you.

946
01:04:34,066 --> 01:04:35,090
You're welcome.

947
01:04:35,134 --> 01:04:36,431
Pay him.

948
01:04:36,468 --> 01:04:37,628
How much do I owe you?

949
01:04:37,670 --> 01:04:39,137
$3.99.

950
01:04:42,241 --> 01:04:46,735
Crab... killer.

951
01:04:46,779 --> 01:04:49,145
$3.99.

952
01:05:15,708 --> 01:05:17,232
Extra points. David...

953
01:05:17,276 --> 01:05:19,437
- Hey, Big Apple.
- Hey, Gary. How's it going?

954
01:05:19,478 --> 01:05:21,571
OK. Have you seen
Karen around here?

955
01:05:21,614 --> 01:05:23,548
Yeah. She should be
around here somewhere.

956
01:05:23,582 --> 01:05:25,174
Because I saw
her moped outside.

957
01:05:25,217 --> 01:05:26,878
I saw her go
with Rick somewhere.

958
01:05:26,919 --> 01:05:28,853
Yeah, but they
should be right back.

959
01:05:28,887 --> 01:05:31,378
- Where did they go?
- They probably went for a walk.

960
01:05:31,423 --> 01:05:33,618
Bullshit, David. He took her
to the football field...

961
01:05:33,659 --> 01:05:36,321
to bust her cherry,
and you know it.

962
01:05:37,463 --> 01:05:39,124
Hey, Gary, hold up!

963
01:05:42,534 --> 01:05:44,195
Asshole!

964
01:09:09,441 --> 01:09:12,501
Gary, what are you doing here?

965
01:09:12,544 --> 01:09:15,012
Nothing much.
Where have you been?

966
01:09:15,047 --> 01:09:17,538
I was out
on the football field.

967
01:09:17,583 --> 01:09:19,050
By yourself?

968
01:09:19,084 --> 01:09:22,611
No, with Karen.
She's right over there.

969
01:09:22,654 --> 01:09:25,145
Just you two?

970
01:09:25,190 --> 01:09:28,091
Of course. I couldn't
wait around for you...

971
01:09:28,126 --> 01:09:30,424
to give me the key
to your grandmother's house.

972
01:09:30,462 --> 01:09:31,554
Meaning what?

973
01:09:31,597 --> 01:09:35,431
Meaning that I was the first one
to get to Miss Thing over there.

974
01:09:35,467 --> 01:09:36,593
You what?

975
01:09:36,635 --> 01:09:38,500
I fucked Karen.

976
01:09:38,537 --> 01:09:41,267
You're full of shit.
You're lying!

977
01:09:41,306 --> 01:09:43,831
What do you want me to do,
show you an instant replay?

978
01:09:43,876 --> 01:09:44,843
You fucked Karen?!

979
01:09:44,877 --> 01:09:47,175
She'll hear you!

980
01:09:50,082 --> 01:09:54,951
Man, you're a fucking liar
and you know it.

981
01:09:54,987 --> 01:09:57,683
Hi, Gary. How's it going?

982
01:10:09,668 --> 01:10:10,965
What's wrong with him?

983
01:10:56,415 --> 01:11:00,112
Just think, three more days
to Christmas vacation.

984
01:11:00,152 --> 01:11:01,346
It's gonna be great.

985
01:11:01,386 --> 01:11:02,910
Yeah, just great.

986
01:11:02,955 --> 01:11:05,321
What's the matter with you?
You should be happy.

987
01:11:05,357 --> 01:11:09,316
Just think, a week from today,
we'll all be on the slopes.

988
01:11:09,361 --> 01:11:11,556
Next time, bring your book
back on time...

989
01:11:11,597 --> 01:11:14,964
if you don't want to pay a fine.
We charge for every day overdue.

990
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,160
- Hi.
- Yes?

991
01:11:16,201 --> 01:11:18,226
Do you have the October issue
of Consumer Reports?

992
01:11:18,270 --> 01:11:19,498
- What year?
- '80.

993
01:11:19,538 --> 01:11:21,802
- I'll look.
- Thanks.

994
01:11:24,209 --> 01:11:26,439
I don't want
to know about it, OK?

995
01:11:26,478 --> 01:11:29,379
We're completely through.
I told you that already.

996
01:11:29,414 --> 01:11:32,212
Why are you coming here with
all these fucking people around?

997
01:11:32,250 --> 01:11:34,150
I told you that
we're through anyway...

998
01:11:34,186 --> 01:11:37,019
so why don't you just split
and leave me alone, OK?

999
01:11:37,055 --> 01:11:39,023
Don't you know what you did?

1000
01:11:39,057 --> 01:11:40,581
Would you get the fuck
out of here already?

1001
01:11:40,626 --> 01:11:43,823
You're embarrassing
the shit out of me. Now split!

1002
01:11:43,862 --> 01:11:45,352
God...

1003
01:12:21,333 --> 01:12:23,301
Karen?

1004
01:12:23,335 --> 01:12:25,303
What's wrong?

1005
01:12:26,872 --> 01:12:29,397
It's got nothing
to do with you.

1006
01:12:29,441 --> 01:12:31,602
I saw you two
arguing in there.

1007
01:12:31,643 --> 01:12:35,511
It's over between us,
so it doesn't matter.

1008
01:12:35,547 --> 01:12:37,412
So why are you crying, then?

1009
01:12:37,449 --> 01:12:41,749
Look... I'll be all right.

1010
01:12:43,488 --> 01:12:48,289
Relax. You know all couples
have their moments.

1011
01:12:48,326 --> 01:12:51,090
He'll cool off. I know him.
Don't worry about it.

1012
01:12:51,129 --> 01:12:53,689
I really don't care
what he does!

1013
01:12:53,732 --> 01:12:55,791
He will get over it.

1014
01:12:55,834 --> 01:12:57,199
I'm...

1015
01:12:57,235 --> 01:12:58,930
I'm pregnant.

1016
01:13:07,713 --> 01:13:11,308
Look, hey, don't worry.

1017
01:13:11,349 --> 01:13:14,750
It's gonna be all right.

1018
01:13:14,786 --> 01:13:18,415
Come on, listen to me.

1019
01:13:18,457 --> 01:13:21,051
OK, I want you to get
yourself together...

1020
01:13:21,093 --> 01:13:25,792
and don't breathe
a word of this to anyone.

1021
01:13:25,831 --> 01:13:28,766
I'm gonna take care of this,
understand?

1022
01:13:31,503 --> 01:13:34,301
I'm gonna help you.

1023
01:13:34,339 --> 01:13:36,705
OK?

1024
01:13:36,742 --> 01:13:38,471
OK.

1025
01:13:50,288 --> 01:13:52,051
What's your problem?

1026
01:13:52,090 --> 01:13:55,082
She's pregnant
and you know it.

1027
01:13:55,127 --> 01:13:57,857
Good news travels fast, huh?

1028
01:13:57,896 --> 01:13:59,625
What are you gonna do,
come to her rescue?

1029
01:13:59,664 --> 01:14:01,359
That's what you should
be doing, Ricky.

1030
01:14:01,399 --> 01:14:03,594
Hey, what's it got
to do with you, man?

1031
01:14:03,635 --> 01:14:05,967
Anyway, I've had it with her.
It's over.

1032
01:14:06,004 --> 01:14:10,498
That's very convenient,
isn't it?

1033
01:14:10,542 --> 01:14:12,567
Hey, she's been getting
on my nerves.

1034
01:14:12,611 --> 01:14:14,408
She's pregnant, you creep!

1035
01:14:14,446 --> 01:14:16,505
So what? She's not the first.

1036
01:14:16,548 --> 01:14:18,277
Yeah, but you were!
Have you forgotten?

1037
01:14:18,316 --> 01:14:21,649
Me? The first?
Forget it, buddy.

1038
01:14:21,686 --> 01:14:23,881
What are you trying to say?

1039
01:14:23,922 --> 01:14:27,449
That I'm probably not the only
guy that ever screwed her.

1040
01:14:27,492 --> 01:14:31,360
You take that back before
I decide to bust your head open!

1041
01:14:31,396 --> 01:14:33,887
I'll say whatever I like,
you asshole!

1042
01:14:39,905 --> 01:14:42,135
Stop it!
I will not have that in here!

1043
01:14:42,174 --> 01:14:43,573
You're jealous
'cause it wasn't you!

1044
01:14:43,608 --> 01:14:45,735
You're a stupid asshole!

1045
01:14:45,777 --> 01:14:49,235
Anytime, pizza boy!
Anytime, man!

1046
01:14:49,281 --> 01:14:51,181
You're the biggest load
I've ever met!

1047
01:14:51,216 --> 01:14:54,811
You are gonna regret this,
Gary, man.

1048
01:14:54,853 --> 01:14:56,912
You're nothing
but a piece of shit!

1049
01:14:56,955 --> 01:15:00,083
I will call the principal
if you don't get out of here!

1050
01:15:09,634 --> 01:15:11,465
David, you geek, come on, man.

1051
01:15:11,503 --> 01:15:13,095
We've been waiting for you.
Get it together.

1052
01:15:13,138 --> 01:15:15,299
- David!
- Come on, man!

1053
01:15:22,147 --> 01:15:24,012
Come on, let's go! Let's go!

1054
01:15:24,049 --> 01:15:26,347
Come on! All right! Come on!

1055
01:15:29,921 --> 01:15:32,481
Hey, come on!

1056
01:15:32,524 --> 01:15:34,617
Hey, wait! Where you going?

1057
01:15:36,795 --> 01:15:39,525
Come on, man!
Hurry up! Get in!

1058
01:15:51,009 --> 01:15:53,273
That's OK. I got it.

1059
01:15:53,311 --> 01:15:55,302
Go on in.

1060
01:16:04,623 --> 01:16:06,716
It's been empty for a year.

1061
01:16:06,758 --> 01:16:09,886
Every since my grandmother died,
nobody's been here.

1062
01:16:11,296 --> 01:16:14,163
It'll look better
once I put up the blinds.

1063
01:16:17,969 --> 01:16:20,233
It needs a little cleaning.

1064
01:16:27,379 --> 01:16:31,543
Good. At least she left us
a working radio.

1065
01:16:31,583 --> 01:16:34,814
Karen, do you want to see
a picture of me when I was two?

1066
01:16:43,061 --> 01:16:46,895
Please... don't cry.

1067
01:16:51,036 --> 01:16:52,799
I promise...

1068
01:16:52,837 --> 01:16:55,499
I promise you
it'll be all right.

1069
01:16:58,977 --> 01:17:01,639
Karen, I know dozens of girls
who have been through it...

1070
01:17:01,680 --> 01:17:03,170
and it was fine.

1071
01:17:07,185 --> 01:17:09,653
Please, I promise.
Just don't cry.

1072
01:17:10,989 --> 01:17:12,320
You know, of course...

1073
01:17:12,357 --> 01:17:14,484
there are certain precautions
you could have taken...

1074
01:17:14,526 --> 01:17:17,620
before the few moments
of pleasure that you enjoyed.

1075
01:17:19,431 --> 01:17:23,094
The operation itself
is quite simple.

1076
01:17:23,134 --> 01:17:26,865
Still, it does cost money.
$250 to be exact.

1077
01:17:26,905 --> 01:17:31,137
That's OK. I can cover that.

1078
01:17:31,176 --> 01:17:34,805
- Cash.
- Cash.

1079
01:17:34,846 --> 01:17:37,838
Fine. You'll bring it
with you this evening.

1080
01:17:37,882 --> 01:17:39,474
Now, I'd like you to leave us.

1081
01:17:39,517 --> 01:17:41,508
Come back at 6:00.
She'll be ready then.

1082
01:18:58,997 --> 01:19:02,296
Look, I need to know
how much I can get for this.

1083
01:19:02,333 --> 01:19:03,800
This is my stereo...

1084
01:19:15,647 --> 01:19:18,013
Thank you.

1085
01:19:32,430 --> 01:19:34,557
Hey, Gino, I gotta talk to you.

1086
01:19:34,599 --> 01:19:37,830
The Olympic ski team is back.
Can't you see I'm busy?

1087
01:19:37,869 --> 01:19:39,598
Gino, please,
will you listen to me?

1088
01:19:39,637 --> 01:19:40,729
What?

1089
01:19:40,772 --> 01:19:42,569
I gotta borrow a hundred bucks.

1090
01:19:42,607 --> 01:19:44,575
You gotta? You gotta get
your ass outta here.

1091
01:19:44,609 --> 01:19:46,509
Hundred bucks. Are you crazy?

1092
01:19:46,544 --> 01:19:48,637
Look, I'm serious. I mean it.

1093
01:19:54,219 --> 01:19:57,484
Gino, please.
It's an emergency.

1094
01:20:16,674 --> 01:20:17,971
How is she?

1095
01:20:18,009 --> 01:20:19,340
She's fine.

1096
01:20:19,377 --> 01:20:21,436
She's resting.

1097
01:20:21,479 --> 01:20:22,969
She's in Room 16.

1098
01:20:23,014 --> 01:20:24,811
You can take her home now.

1099
01:23:00,405 --> 01:23:01,565
Gary?

1100
01:23:01,606 --> 01:23:02,732
Yeah?

1101
01:23:02,774 --> 01:23:04,765
Where did you put
the yellow towel?

1102
01:23:04,809 --> 01:23:07,175
It's on the chair.

1103
01:23:07,211 --> 01:23:08,872
Oh, I see it.

1104
01:23:14,085 --> 01:23:16,144
Come on,
your eggs are getting cold.

1105
01:23:16,187 --> 01:23:17,848
I'll be right there.

1106
01:23:21,793 --> 01:23:22,817
Good morning.

1107
01:23:22,860 --> 01:23:25,021
Good morning. I'm so hungry.

1108
01:23:26,364 --> 01:23:28,594
- How'd you sleep?
- Oh, fine.

1109
01:23:28,633 --> 01:23:30,601
I'm sorry you had to sleep
on the couch...

1110
01:23:30,635 --> 01:23:32,102
because of me last night.

1111
01:23:32,136 --> 01:23:34,036
That's OK.
Look, if we'd gone skiing...

1112
01:23:34,072 --> 01:23:36,666
I would've been sleeping
on a cold floor somewhere.

1113
01:23:36,708 --> 01:23:38,699
I wonder how they're all doing.

1114
01:23:40,578 --> 01:23:43,979
Are you sorry you didn't go?

1115
01:23:44,015 --> 01:23:45,243
A little.

1116
01:23:45,283 --> 01:23:49,083
Do you miss anyone?

1117
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:50,781
What do you mean?

1118
01:23:50,822 --> 01:23:53,017
I don't know. I just...

1119
01:23:53,057 --> 01:23:55,423
No, I just wondered
if you missed, you know...

1120
01:23:55,460 --> 01:23:57,189
the gang, or anything.

1121
01:23:57,228 --> 01:23:59,219
Not really.

1122
01:24:00,965 --> 01:24:02,933
I'll make up for it
at my party.

1123
01:24:02,967 --> 01:24:04,958
- What party?
- My birthday party.

1124
01:24:05,002 --> 01:24:06,333
Your birthday? When?

1125
01:24:06,371 --> 01:24:07,599
This Saturday.

1126
01:24:07,638 --> 01:24:09,230
Am I invited?

1127
01:24:09,273 --> 01:24:11,969
That's a dumb question.

1128
01:24:15,613 --> 01:24:17,979
Why are you doing that now?

1129
01:24:18,015 --> 01:24:21,712
I just wanted
to get everything ready.

1130
01:24:21,753 --> 01:24:23,846
You could do it
tomorrow morning.

1131
01:24:23,888 --> 01:24:27,153
Nah, I'd just rather
get it done now.

1132
01:24:28,493 --> 01:24:30,791
Gary?

1133
01:24:30,828 --> 01:24:32,819
I want you to know
I really appreciate...

1134
01:24:32,864 --> 01:24:36,027
everything you've done for me.

1135
01:24:36,067 --> 01:24:38,535
Karen, you're more
than welcome.

1136
01:24:38,569 --> 01:24:40,628
No, you've been a true friend.

1137
01:24:40,671 --> 01:24:42,730
I can't think of anyone
who would've done...

1138
01:24:42,774 --> 01:24:45,641
what you've done for me.

1139
01:24:45,676 --> 01:24:48,304
Karen...

1140
01:24:50,381 --> 01:24:52,372
it's just that...

1141
01:24:55,420 --> 01:24:56,512
that...

1142
01:25:02,627 --> 01:25:03,992
I love you.

1143
01:25:06,798 --> 01:25:08,959
I always have.

1144
01:25:11,769 --> 01:25:14,101
Ever since I first saw you...

1145
01:25:16,441 --> 01:25:18,568
I've loved you.

1146
01:25:18,609 --> 01:25:20,941
I could never tell you, but...

1147
01:25:25,116 --> 01:25:26,378
I love you.

1148
01:26:25,676 --> 01:26:27,200
Hi, Dad.

1149
01:26:27,245 --> 01:26:29,338
Hey, you're back!

1150
01:26:29,380 --> 01:26:31,610
Martha, Gary's home!

1151
01:26:33,718 --> 01:26:35,743
- So, how was the trip?
- Good.

1152
01:26:35,786 --> 01:26:37,185
I heard you had great snow.

1153
01:26:37,221 --> 01:26:40,156
Wonderful, sweetheart.

1154
01:26:40,191 --> 01:26:42,785
You could've at least sent
your mother a postcard.

1155
01:26:42,827 --> 01:26:43,953
Martha.

1156
01:26:43,995 --> 01:26:46,361
There weren't any mailboxes
where we were, Mom.

1157
01:26:46,397 --> 01:26:49,264
So then how come David's mom
got four postcards?

1158
01:26:49,300 --> 01:26:52,565
You see, David chickened out
and stayed behind...

1159
01:26:52,603 --> 01:26:54,093
while we were up at the slopes.

1160
01:26:54,138 --> 01:26:56,504
You have an excuse
for everything.

1161
01:26:56,541 --> 01:26:58,702
Oh, my God. The roast.

1162
01:26:58,743 --> 01:27:00,608
Come here.

1163
01:27:00,645 --> 01:27:02,977
Come on. Welcome home.

1164
01:27:06,517 --> 01:27:08,109
How much is it?

1165
01:27:08,152 --> 01:27:09,585
Like it?

1166
01:27:09,620 --> 01:27:11,110
It's beautiful.

1167
01:27:11,155 --> 01:27:12,247
$80.

1168
01:27:12,290 --> 01:27:14,554
I'll take it.

1169
01:27:14,592 --> 01:27:17,152
And I'd like something
inscribed on it.

1170
01:27:17,194 --> 01:27:18,821
What would you like on it?

1171
01:27:18,863 --> 01:27:21,331
''To Karen with love. ''

1172
01:27:21,365 --> 01:27:22,957
''To Karen with love. ''

1173
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,969
Yeah, and when
will it be ready?

1174
01:27:26,003 --> 01:27:27,527
Monday.

1175
01:27:27,572 --> 01:27:29,472
No, that's no good.

1176
01:27:29,507 --> 01:27:30,804
Why not?

1177
01:27:30,841 --> 01:27:33,867
You see, it's a birthday present
for my girlfriend...

1178
01:27:33,911 --> 01:27:35,503
and tomorrow night's
her birthday.

1179
01:27:35,546 --> 01:27:37,980
All right. Tomorrow night
it'll be ready.

1180
01:27:38,015 --> 01:27:40,347
It will? Thanks.

1181
01:27:40,384 --> 01:27:41,976
Look, I really appreciate it.

1182
01:27:42,019 --> 01:27:43,680
And remember...

1183
01:27:43,721 --> 01:27:45,848
''To Karen... '' with a ''K''...

1184
01:27:45,890 --> 01:27:46,914
''with love. ''

1185
01:27:46,958 --> 01:27:49,483
''To Karen with love. '' Got it.

1186
01:27:49,527 --> 01:27:51,859
OK. I'll see you tomorrow.
Thanks.

1187
01:28:29,166 --> 01:28:32,226
- Hey, Gary, what's goin' on?
- Not much. Where's Karen?

1188
01:28:32,269 --> 01:28:33,827
She's somewhere around here.

1189
01:28:33,871 --> 01:28:34,963
OK, thanks.

1190
01:28:35,006 --> 01:28:36,405
- Hi, Gary.
- Hi.

1191
01:28:36,440 --> 01:28:37,600
What's that for?

1192
01:28:37,642 --> 01:28:40,110
Oh, it's nothing.
Victor, have you seen Karen?

1193
01:28:40,144 --> 01:28:42,442
Yeah, I think I saw her
go in the kitchen.

1194
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:44,539
Great. Thanks, Vic.

1195
01:28:44,582 --> 01:28:45,879
Sure.

1196
01:28:46,879 --> 01:28:56,879
