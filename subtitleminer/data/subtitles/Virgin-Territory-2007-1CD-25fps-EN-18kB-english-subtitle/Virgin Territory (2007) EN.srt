1
00:00:55,148 --> 00:00:57,018
<i>On the late father advice...</i>

2
00:00:57,132 --> 00:00:58,432
<i>I first became a thief.</i>

3
00:00:59,023 --> 00:01:01,797
<i>but then I discover thieving
gets your hands cut off.</i>

4
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:04,980
<i>or your bits smashed
with a hammer.</i>

5
00:01:05,397 --> 00:01:07,779
<i>or hanged, like my father.</i>

6
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:11,942
<i>So I gave up being a thief
and the next best thing.</i>

7
00:01:12,282 --> 00:01:14,325
<i>I joined the church.</i>

8
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,405
<i>Not as a priest, though
it has good prospect.</i>

9
00:01:16,852 --> 00:01:17,742
<i>No.</i>

10
00:01:18,155 --> 00:01:20,629
<i> As a painter. An artist.</i>

11
00:01:20,773 --> 00:01:26,959
<i>I could do it all.
Angels, devils, virgins and nuns.</i>

12
00:01:27,394 --> 00:01:31,124
<i>Painting bones on angels is not
a bad way of earning a living.</i>

13
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:32,769
<i>And I was happy.</i>

14
00:01:33,772 --> 00:01:35,701
<i>Then everything changed.</i>

15
00:01:36,709 --> 00:01:38,730
<i>Not just for me....
For everyone.</i>

16
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:42,910
<i>The rich, the poor,
everyone...</i>

17
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:46,267
<i>This boy, Lorenzo, he always leading trouble.
Always pushing his luck.</i>

18
00:02:47,561 --> 00:02:52,516
<i>Lorenzo's a gambler, a winner,
but his luck has run out.</i>

19
00:02:52,551 --> 00:02:57,585
<i>This time he won against the wrong person.
Gerbino Della Ratta.</i>

20
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:01,179
<i>They had this fight you see.
And Gerbino's a bad loser.</i>

21
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:03,712
<i>A really bad loser.</i>

22
00:03:03,747 --> 00:03:08,063
<i>Gerbino Della Ratta would resent
losing a dirty sock in a wager.</i>

23
00:03:08,098 --> 00:03:10,636
<i>That's the kind of person he is.</i>

24
00:03:11,871 --> 00:03:16,160
-Come down here and fight me.
-So you can put a scar like that on my cheek.

25
00:03:16,595 --> 00:03:20,902
I've improved your looks, you ugly shit,
but I'm far too beautiful.

26
00:03:33,219 --> 00:03:34,853
Your next.

27
00:03:36,401 --> 00:03:39,063
Into the shit,
where you belong.

28
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:41,524
Why is he still alive,
Andreuccio?

29
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:43,208
I told you, I
want him dead.

30
00:03:54,598 --> 00:03:59,410
<i>Lorenzo De Lamberti was not the
first to have a thing for Pampinea Anastasi.</i>

31
00:04:00,354 --> 00:04:02,967
<i>Although he was the
last one to admit.</i>

32
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:08,110
<i>The richest girl in town.
Pampinea is not so much spoiled...</i>

33
00:04:08,379 --> 00:04:11,035
<i>as laviously as
overindulged.</i>

34
00:04:11,337 --> 00:04:13,345
<i>Poor little rich girl.</i>

35
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:17,398
<i>But that was before the plague.
Not now.</i>

36
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,210
<i>Everything changed.</i>

37
00:04:19,745 --> 00:04:22,128
<i>Even for Pampinea.</i>

38
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:32,974
Lorenzo, quick!

39
00:04:33,109 --> 00:04:34,954
Gerbino waiting for
you’re at your house.

40
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:37,273
He won't rest until
you're dead.

41
00:04:38,673 --> 00:04:40,996
Get the hell out.
Now!

42
00:04:56,651 --> 00:05:00,852
<i>Having painted the bones on 14 angels,
I was still waiting to be paid.</i>

43
00:05:02,027 --> 00:05:04,824
-Did you tell him?
-He's still asleep.

44
00:05:05,431 --> 00:05:07,207
Wait there.

45
00:05:08,721 --> 00:05:10,502
There.

46
00:05:13,943 --> 00:05:17,083
Plague.
Just my luck.

47
00:05:17,198 --> 00:05:19,432
Looks like we're not
getting paid.

48
00:05:20,643 --> 00:05:23,857
Go home.
Your done here.

49
00:05:25,144 --> 00:05:27,492
<i>Then I heard voices.</i>

50
00:05:32,797 --> 00:05:36,768
<i>Come and join us.
Priest, right!</i>

51
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:38,205
<i>They got it all!</i>

52
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,302
Food, money.

53
00:05:40,337 --> 00:05:43,518
<i>And of course,
the key to the convent.</i>

54
00:05:43,553 --> 00:05:46,393
<i>All those beautiful nuns.</i>

55
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:57,002
<i>Rumor has it, Gerbino Della Ratta
is a bit short on his equipment.</i>

56
00:05:57,037 --> 00:06:01,807
<i>You know, not much going on
downstairs in the trouser department.</i>

57
00:06:02,442 --> 00:06:06,799
<i>Its funny, cause I always thought
he was the biggest dick in town.</i>

58
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,077
Pampinea.

59
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:27,770
I offer my symphony

60
00:06:28,411 --> 00:06:30,635
-Thank you.
-It's a tragedy.

61
00:06:31,554 --> 00:06:32,729
This plague...

62
00:06:33,798 --> 00:06:34,760
Terrible

63
00:06:35,649 --> 00:06:36,331
Terrible...

64
00:06:36,655 --> 00:06:37,639
Tragedy

65
00:06:39,344 --> 00:06:41,917
What would you do now,
Pampinea?

66
00:06:43,316 --> 00:06:45,624
I promised to marry
Count Dzerzhinsky.

67
00:06:45,659 --> 00:06:48,161
He's on his way here
from Russia to marry me.

68
00:06:58,491 --> 00:07:00,456
Thank you for
your assistance.

69
00:07:01,746 --> 00:07:03,107
Pampinea.

70
00:07:03,142 --> 00:07:07,114
Before he died, your father
asked me to protect you.

71
00:07:07,149 --> 00:07:10,372
-From what?
-His estate.

72
00:07:10,407 --> 00:07:15,551
He was in debt.
Massive in debt with his business failing.

73
00:07:18,654 --> 00:07:21,568
To who?
To who was he in debt?

74
00:07:22,703 --> 00:07:27,056
Business people.
Merchants. But I paid them off.

75
00:07:27,659 --> 00:07:28,906
You?

76
00:07:28,941 --> 00:07:31,177
It's what's known
as a secured loan.

77
00:07:31,412 --> 00:07:33,765
Your father borrowed money from me,
to pay his debt...

78
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,403
against the security of this house
and all his other assets.

79
00:07:36,542 --> 00:07:38,952
All this. None of this
belong to him anymore

80
00:07:39,021 --> 00:07:42,841
-Who does it belong to then?
-Me.

81
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:47,345
Unless you pay me
the money he owe.

82
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:51,506
You don't have to worry that
Pampinea, I am here for you.

83
00:07:51,841 --> 00:07:55,364
Your father and I discussed this
before he died, and he agreed.

84
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:59,451
-Agreed to what?
-That you should marry me.

85
00:07:59,486 --> 00:08:02,327
I'm promised to marry
Count Dzerzhinsky!

86
00:08:02,362 --> 00:08:07,049
This is a badly arranged marriage.
Your father told me before he died...

87
00:08:07,282 --> 00:08:08,519
He much prefer me.

88
00:08:11,594 --> 00:08:15,527
Pampinea, I am
devoted to you.

89
00:08:18,364 --> 00:08:20,520
Marry me.

90
00:08:20,555 --> 00:08:22,752
I'm your to command.

91
00:08:25,249 --> 00:08:28,012
May I kiss your hand?

92
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:12,184
That always been a problem isn’t it.
You know. Theocracy.

93
00:09:16,929 --> 00:09:19,803
She should've done something about
about that, it doesn’t cost anything, does it?

94
00:09:20,038 --> 00:09:22,245
Hey you!
Where does this road lead?

95
00:09:23,652 --> 00:09:27,277
-Bet your wondering what I'm doing.
-No, not really. No.

96
00:09:27,312 --> 00:09:29,509
-My friend.
-What's the matter with him? Is he drunk?

97
00:09:29,544 --> 00:09:32,989
-No.... Guess.
-Is he dead?

98
00:09:33,024 --> 00:09:35,023
Right!
Good guess!

99
00:09:35,824 --> 00:09:38,021
"I am dead,
check out.."

100
00:09:38,056 --> 00:09:41,201
-Please tell me, where does this road lead to?
-I'm gonna tell you the answer...

101
00:09:41,236 --> 00:09:44,526
to this one, because you'll never
guess and we'll be standing here all day.

102
00:09:44,561 --> 00:09:47,607
-That's what I was thinking.
-This road lead to...

103
00:09:47,642 --> 00:09:51,767
Wait for it... the sacred sisters
of the Bleeding Heart.

104
00:09:51,802 --> 00:09:54,491
The convent.
What was he doing in a convent?

105
00:09:54,526 --> 00:09:59,862
What was he doing in a convent?
We'll give you a clue.

106
00:09:59,897 --> 00:10:04,515
-He was working there as a...
-Gardener?

107
00:10:05,658 --> 00:10:08,153
Right again!
Very clever.

108
00:10:08,188 --> 00:10:10,840
-Do they need a new gardener?
-Do you have special skills.

109
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:13,300
That's not a trick question,
he has special skills.

110
00:10:13,335 --> 00:10:17,386
-Like what, dying?
-No. Guess. Guess!

111
00:10:17,421 --> 00:10:21,697
-I don't know. How the hell should I know?
-Don't get dirty.

112
00:10:21,732 --> 00:10:24,836
-What then, what?!
-Ow, together.

113
00:10:24,871 --> 00:10:29,642
-Come on, tell me!
-He was deaf, and dumb.

114
00:10:29,677 --> 00:10:34,180
Deaf, therefore dumb.
I told you, he had special skills.

115
00:10:34,215 --> 00:10:38,038
Being deaf and dumb is not a skill.
It's a handicap.

116
00:10:38,073 --> 00:10:40,953
For him it weren't.
Bye!

117
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:48,077
Hello there!
I bet your wondering what I...

118
00:12:07,851 --> 00:12:10,350
Straight from heaven.

119
00:12:18,308 --> 00:12:20,388
He's beautiful.

120
00:12:21,334 --> 00:12:22,306
Strong.

121
00:12:24,292 --> 00:12:25,572
Look at him.
He's....

122
00:12:27,045 --> 00:12:28,785
Beautiful.

123
00:12:34,501 --> 00:12:37,223
-Is he hurt?
-I don't know.

124
00:12:40,002 --> 00:12:42,838
Do you think we should take off his coat
to see if he broken his bone?

125
00:12:45,374 --> 00:12:47,156
I think we should...

126
00:12:47,757 --> 00:12:48,939
Just to be sure.

127
00:12:50,923 --> 00:12:52,608
We should we start?

128
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:26,058
Your turn.

129
00:13:42,859 --> 00:13:45,207
His mouth.
Kiss his mouth.

130
00:14:04,955 --> 00:14:07,075
Sisters?

131
00:14:16,582 --> 00:14:19,229
Mother,
He's alive.

132
00:14:20,175 --> 00:14:23,656
He has said nothing mother.
We believe he is deaf and dumb.

133
00:14:29,633 --> 00:14:32,737
Can you hear?

134
00:14:39,974 --> 00:14:42,396
Can you....
speak?

135
00:14:46,254 --> 00:14:48,224
A miracle.

136
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:50,872
An angel.
He fell from heaven.

137
00:14:55,117 --> 00:14:57,009
Take him to the bathroom.

138
00:15:01,437 --> 00:15:02,800
Clean him.

139
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:05,203
<i>For the first time in her life,
Pampinea Anastasi feels the need for friends.</i>

140
00:16:13,465 --> 00:16:18,095
Filomena!
Did you tell the others?

141
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:20,810
We meet them at the church.

142
00:16:39,084 --> 00:16:42,527
Alright you lot.
Girls in front, boys step back.

143
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,090
Quino, I didn't expect to see
you here I must say.

144
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:50,166
You can say, but  you’re
not allow to talk.

145
00:16:50,473 --> 00:16:52,779
No problem, I'm sure you have
enough to say for everyone.

146
00:16:56,753 --> 00:16:59,742
-This is the girl you want to marry?
-Can't wait.

147
00:17:00,234 --> 00:17:01,900
I could eat her alive.

148
00:17:02,353 --> 00:17:04,851
My father has a house in the country.
Our villa.

149
00:17:05,686 --> 00:17:08,066
We could all go there
to escape the plague.

150
00:17:08,201 --> 00:17:09,503
Good, let’s go.

151
00:17:09,538 --> 00:17:12,719
My parent's dying wish was I
to marry Count Dzerzhinsky.

152
00:17:13,054 --> 00:17:15,016
The marriage will take
place at the villa.

153
00:17:16,086 --> 00:17:17,178
You'll all be the guest.

154
00:17:17,294 --> 00:17:19,644
Pampinea.
This is an arranged marriage, yes?

155
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,974
Maybe you should try it first.
At least take a look.

156
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:23,987
Melissa!

157
00:17:24,188 --> 00:17:26,356
That is an insult to Pampinea's
pledge to  chastity.

158
00:17:26,391 --> 00:17:30,176
-We're all virgins here.
-Yes, but some are more virgin than others.

159
00:17:30,211 --> 00:17:31,363
Speak for yourself.

160
00:17:32,064 --> 00:17:35,435
I would rather die than lose
my virginity before marriage.

161
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:38,082
I always thought you had
a thing for Lorenzo.

162
00:17:38,117 --> 00:17:39,598
What's this?

163
00:17:47,012 --> 00:17:49,697
-What are you doing here all of you?
-Praying.

164
00:17:49,732 --> 00:17:52,119
We're praying for the dead.

165
00:17:53,555 --> 00:17:57,454
Anyone of you thinking of leaving the city,
could prove extremely dangerous.

166
00:17:58,289 --> 00:18:02,046
Go home, all of you.
Like good children.

167
00:18:10,729 --> 00:18:14,625
I recognize these two.
They're friends of Di Lamberti.

168
00:18:16,478 --> 00:18:18,297
Perhaps, we should
take a walk.

169
00:18:20,505 --> 00:18:21,599
<i>I knew I should have
kept my mouth shut.</i>

170
00:18:21,748 --> 00:18:22,570
<i>What do I care?</i>

171
00:18:22,924 --> 00:18:24,381
<i>Even if he was
going to kill them.</i>

172
00:18:25,082 --> 00:18:27,087
<i>Then I heard those
damn noise again.</i>

173
00:18:27,122 --> 00:18:32,388
<i>Keep  your  mouth shut! Keep your mouth shut!
Keep your mouth shut...</i>

174
00:18:32,489 --> 00:18:35,449
<i>Keep  your  mouth shut!</i>

175
00:18:36,769 --> 00:18:39,836
<i>Oh what the hell!
I did have a big trough.</i>

176
00:18:44,667 --> 00:18:49,699
You! All of you leave.
Take you swords and leave the church.

177
00:18:50,986 --> 00:18:55,260
This is to Gerbino Della Ratta.
No one speaks to him like that.

178
00:18:55,295 --> 00:18:59,308
This is the house of God and
I speak with his voice.

179
00:19:11,215 --> 00:19:13,046
Who are you?

180
00:19:13,081 --> 00:19:15,733
I'm the servant of God.
I speak with his voice.

181
00:19:15,768 --> 00:19:19,779
You ran across of our Lord.
When did you last take your confession?

182
00:19:19,814 --> 00:19:23,033
The plague that walks our streets,
steal our soul.

183
00:19:23,068 --> 00:19:25,154
It’s the Armageddon.

184
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:29,390
See your face again?

185
00:19:29,425 --> 00:19:32,531
I'll take your blood and
send it to your maker.

186
00:19:36,551 --> 00:19:38,177
Gerbino!

187
00:19:40,524 --> 00:19:43,212
Is he dead?
Lorenzo Di Lamberti?

188
00:19:43,247 --> 00:19:45,556
If I were you,
I'll consider him dead

189
00:19:51,801 --> 00:19:55,584
<i>I never talked such
bollocks in all my life.</i>

190
00:19:55,619 --> 00:19:57,966
<i>Thank God for
being a priest..</i>

191
00:20:03,454 --> 00:20:07,315
Is this it?
I thought you could get a carriage.

192
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:09,497
This is Uncle Bruno.

193
00:20:10,098 --> 00:20:13,515
He's not very bright but he's very strong.
Isn’t that right Uncle Bruno?

194
00:20:15,637 --> 00:20:18,247
And he's a virgin.
Are you Uncle Bruno?

195
00:20:19,155 --> 00:20:21,916
I am.
I'm saving myself.

196
00:20:24,467 --> 00:20:29,082
-Who's that?
-It's the priest, Father Tindero.

197
00:20:29,117 --> 00:20:31,579
If this to be a wedding,
you'll need a priest.

198
00:20:33,587 --> 00:20:37,607
<i>After hanging around in a square for
a couple of hours, waiting for Pampinea.</i>

199
00:20:38,232 --> 00:20:43,836
<i>We discover she'd gone to a convent to escape
from Gerbino and wait for her Russian Count.</i>

200
00:20:45,465 --> 00:20:49,364
<i>What better place to preserve her virginity
than amongst other virgins?</i>

201
00:20:50,723 --> 00:20:52,805
<i>Or so she thought.</i>

202
00:20:57,736 --> 00:21:01,328
-Who's that man?
-He's our gardener.

203
00:21:03,031 --> 00:21:05,225
Sent from heaven.

204
00:21:07,618 --> 00:21:11,703
-He's dead and dumb.
-What?

205
00:21:11,738 --> 00:21:14,201
He can't hear or
speak a word.

206
00:21:14,236 --> 00:21:18,225
How sad. He looks as if he have
alot to say for himself.

207
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:23,749
Hear no evil,
speak no evil.

208
00:21:35,732 --> 00:21:37,852
Come here!

209
00:21:49,503 --> 00:21:52,002
<i>Now jealousy is
a funny thing.</i>

210
00:21:52,037 --> 00:21:54,196
<i>It creeps up on you.
Take you by surprise.</i>

211
00:21:54,231 --> 00:21:58,736
<i>Distracted, Pampinea's
Russian Count have slipped from a line.</i>

212
00:22:45,213 --> 00:22:47,787
What is that?

213
00:23:01,915 --> 00:23:04,034
I am here.
Hello.

214
00:23:05,706 --> 00:23:09,734
I bring gift for you, your wife
and your daughter.

215
00:23:10,937 --> 00:23:12,146
Soon to be my wife.

216
00:23:12,181 --> 00:23:14,130
Soon to be my wife.
You are Pampinea's father, Yes?

217
00:23:14,829 --> 00:23:17,614
I am Pampinea's father.
No

218
00:23:17,827 --> 00:23:18,804
No?

219
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:29,775
I am Gerbino Della Ratta,
Pampinea's husband to be.

220
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:42,449
Sir, there has
been a mistake.

221
00:23:43,282 --> 00:23:46,840
Pampinea Anastasi is suppose
to be married to me.

222
00:23:49,148 --> 00:23:53,044
Count.
You don't mind me calling you a Count?

223
00:23:54,748 --> 00:23:57,283
You look like a big
Count to me...

224
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:02,013
Pampinea Anastasi soon
to be my wife.

225
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:06,289
You just didn't hear about it...
That is a mistake.

226
00:24:09,921 --> 00:24:16,805
So you bring me, all the way from Novgorod
to tell me, that Pampinea Anastasi

227
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:21,573
is marrying a man who is
old enough to be her father?

228
00:24:23,202 --> 00:24:26,492
I did not bring you here,
but I suggest you leave.

229
00:24:27,552 --> 00:24:31,298
Florence is very bad for the
health at this time of year.

230
00:24:34,706 --> 00:24:37,943
Gerbino Della Ratta.

231
00:24:48,362 --> 00:24:49,808
Yes.

232
00:24:50,675 --> 00:24:52,397
Yes, I thought that much.

233
00:25:05,249 --> 00:25:06,498
Sir!

234
00:25:07,597 --> 00:25:11,304
I'm Linguino, servant to  Pampinea Anastasi.
She's safe and well.

235
00:25:11,796 --> 00:25:14,340
And no matter what you hear,
is waiting for your arrival...

236
00:25:14,995 --> 00:25:18,709
This letter will give you instructions on
how to get to her villa in the country.

237
00:25:18,828 --> 00:25:20,387
She'll meet you there
for the wedding.

238
00:25:28,795 --> 00:25:30,918
Sir, you are in danger here.
You want to ride straight to the villa.

239
00:25:31,332 --> 00:25:32,395
Be there as soon
as you can.

240
00:25:32,882 --> 00:25:35,115
For Pampinea,
I will do this.

241
00:26:10,413 --> 00:26:12,985
We know you cannot hear
us or speak to us.

242
00:26:13,286 --> 00:26:17,450
But to us, you are so beautiful like an angel
sent from heaven to bring us joy.

243
00:26:17,485 --> 00:26:23,540
And we pray, that God might restore the
miracle of speech to you and your hearing.

244
00:26:23,575 --> 00:26:26,718
So that you can hear
the birds sing and...

245
00:26:27,212 --> 00:26:29,368
-Get on with it!
-I am!

246
00:26:29,403 --> 00:26:31,829
-No idea what you're saying.
-You do it.

247
00:26:31,864 --> 00:26:38,789
We know that this morning, we met
Sister Catherina in the orchards

248
00:26:38,824 --> 00:26:41,363
and then Sister
Melissabeta in the granary.

249
00:26:41,398 --> 00:26:44,125
We want what you gave them.

250
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,131
And we want it now.

251
00:26:47,152 --> 00:26:48,553
Come on.

252
00:26:58,789 --> 00:27:02,345
<i> There to Florence,
there I was, stuck on the cart.</i>

253
00:27:02,873 --> 00:27:05,153
<i>This Uncle Bruno farting
more than the horse.</i>

254
00:27:05,831 --> 00:27:08,615
<i>and Miss randy-pant banging
about being a virgin.</i>

255
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:12,862
<i>Truth is, those that rattle on
about it, can’t wait to do it.</i>

256
00:27:13,496 --> 00:27:16,259
<i>God, there she goes again.</i>

257
00:27:16,675 --> 00:27:20,658
I'm very proud of my virginity,
Melissa. And so is Dioneo.

258
00:27:21,593 --> 00:27:23,085
<i>The boyfriend, Dioneo.</i>

259
00:27:23,486 --> 00:27:26,300
<i>He's suffering from terminal
randiness as well.</i>

260
00:27:27,344 --> 00:27:28,860
<i>Never done it in his life.</i>

261
00:27:28,995 --> 00:27:29,850
Dioneo!

262
00:27:31,051 --> 00:27:33,293
We don't indulge in sex.
Do we?

263
00:27:33,328 --> 00:27:36,673
Not in broad daylight, in the middle
of the road, we don't. No.

264
00:27:37,345 --> 00:27:40,415
I say, we believe in no
sex before marriage.

265
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:42,263
We're happy to wait, aren't we?

266
00:27:42,298 --> 00:27:43,956
Forever my love.

267
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:45,607
Liar.

268
00:27:53,345 --> 00:27:55,313
Who's that?

269
00:27:56,374 --> 00:27:57,699
Are they waving at us?

270
00:27:58,456 --> 00:28:00,551
No, I think they're
waving at me.

271
00:28:04,069 --> 00:28:05,663
See what they want.
Quick before they come!

272
00:28:05,964 --> 00:28:06,706
Me?

273
00:28:06,741 --> 00:28:08,839
Run before they
come into Filomena!

274
00:28:09,257 --> 00:28:13,191
No, No.
You go. You go.

275
00:28:29,149 --> 00:28:33,576
Do we want any milk or bread? They said
their produce is very fresh...

276
00:28:33,917 --> 00:28:36,036
and we might want to sample
it back at their farm.

277
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,568
It’s too late.

278
00:28:45,083 --> 00:28:46,899
We can get to them.
Come on.

279
00:28:47,845 --> 00:28:48,793
Come on!

280
00:29:02,135 --> 00:29:03,765
Help yourself.

281
00:29:04,443 --> 00:29:06,035
Fresh milk,
there it is.

282
00:29:06,753 --> 00:29:09,114
How do you get
milk out of that?

283
00:29:10,667 --> 00:29:12,445
City boys.

284
00:29:13,581 --> 00:29:16,607
Where we come from,
milk come out of the jug.

285
00:29:16,642 --> 00:29:18,690
I bet you could do it,
if you tried.

286
00:29:21,302 --> 00:29:22,407
Show us.

287
00:29:28,471 --> 00:29:30,023
This is how it’s done.

288
00:29:31,121 --> 00:29:33,392
See how its fit nicely
fit into my hands?

289
00:29:34,527 --> 00:29:37,328
I love this thing in my hands.
Don't you, Mira?

290
00:29:37,933 --> 00:29:39,407
Wonderful.

291
00:29:39,991 --> 00:29:43,032
You'd almost say a little
firmer would be better.

292
00:29:43,677 --> 00:29:45,796
Too late,
can't stop now.

293
00:29:53,855 --> 00:29:57,865
Take it firmly in your hands,
and squeeze.

294
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:03,768
Stroke up.

295
00:30:05,661 --> 00:30:09,633
And pull.

296
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:11,867
I love this.

297
00:30:12,283 --> 00:30:14,326
It’s coming.
I can feel it.

298
00:30:14,856 --> 00:30:17,316
A little strong?
A little faster?

299
00:30:17,999 --> 00:30:19,247
It's coming!

300
00:30:19,828 --> 00:30:21,149
Milky white, hot.

301
00:30:24,017 --> 00:30:27,041
Please!
Yesona, let do it!

302
00:30:44,477 --> 00:30:48,487
Dioneo. Just want are you
doing with that cow?

303
00:30:50,569 --> 00:30:55,075
"Yesona, let do it!?"
Disgusting. Disgusting.

304
00:30:55,754 --> 00:30:58,213
-I told you, we wasn't there for the milk.
-There's the maid.

305
00:30:58,450 --> 00:30:59,923
Those shou not touch!
Remember?

306
00:31:00,351 --> 00:31:04,631
That include beasts and barns,
especially ones with tits and hairy armpits.

307
00:31:04,995 --> 00:31:08,417
Piss off, it’s over! You'll never have
sex with me as long as you live!.

308
00:31:11,595 --> 00:31:14,999
<i>Sometime later, I heard that the
cow was emotional disturbed...</i>

309
00:31:15,034 --> 00:31:17,587
<i>by these events, and
never gave milk again.</i>

310
00:31:17,622 --> 00:31:19,518
<i>Poor cow.</i>

311
00:31:24,219 --> 00:31:26,980
It's a sin what you just said.
And the other two.

312
00:31:27,015 --> 00:31:28,290
Yes, your right.

313
00:31:29,301 --> 00:31:31,224
It’s a sin.
A delicious sin.

314
00:31:31,259 --> 00:31:33,678
The four of you in one day!
You should be ashamed.

315
00:31:33,713 --> 00:31:35,305
I think your jealous.

316
00:31:35,788 --> 00:31:36,731
Huh

317
00:32:22,662 --> 00:32:25,047
I hope you'll drown.

318
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:20,318
Get him, now!

319
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:01,557
Andruccio.

320
00:34:34,483 --> 00:34:35,798
What's that?

321
00:34:36,099 --> 00:34:37,211
See that?

322
00:34:38,039 --> 00:34:40,690
It's fantastic.
I want that!

323
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:42,810
Get me that!

324
00:34:53,301 --> 00:34:55,722
Up your ass!

325
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:01,707
Are you leaving, Father?

326
00:35:01,742 --> 00:35:05,644
From the church... Gerbino.
He was afraid of me, wasn't he?

327
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:08,596
He was afraid of the cross
you wear around your neck.

328
00:35:10,272 --> 00:35:12,808
Allow me to make a
small observation.

329
00:35:12,843 --> 00:35:16,327
-All this talk of virginity.
-Yes?

330
00:35:17,877 --> 00:35:20,231
A kiss mouth doesn't lose its freshness.

331
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:24,043
like the moon,
its rises new again.

332
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:29,607
-Very poetic I'm sure.
-Just an observation.

333
00:35:29,642 --> 00:35:31,743
It wasn't me that said it.

334
00:35:32,383 --> 00:35:33,354
What about the wedding?

335
00:35:33,389 --> 00:35:34,692
I'll be there.

336
00:35:36,246 --> 00:35:38,832
<i>But first I had to make
a pilgrimage of my own.</i>

337
00:35:55,807 --> 00:35:58,076
Yesona.

338
00:36:05,094 --> 00:36:07,478
Yesona!

339
00:36:11,629 --> 00:36:14,353
Yesona, I'm here.

340
00:36:16,851 --> 00:36:20,484
I love you my dear.

341
00:36:21,166 --> 00:36:23,588
Yesona, let’s take ride
into the sunset.

342
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:28,054
You filthy disgusting beast!

343
00:38:32,168 --> 00:38:36,896
Every day I see you...
I'm drawn to you.

344
00:38:39,962 --> 00:38:44,992
Every night I sleep...
I am with you.

345
00:38:57,037 --> 00:38:59,004
Everyday...

346
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:06,499
Every night.

347
00:39:50,332 --> 00:39:54,237
I think it farted up with you Filomena,
that's the true of it.

348
00:39:55,165 --> 00:39:59,036
Well, when it comes to farting,
Uncle Bruno, you should know.

349
00:40:00,397 --> 00:40:02,256
Dioneo...

350
00:40:06,357 --> 00:40:07,735
Dioneo!

351
00:40:16,208 --> 00:40:18,027
Stop this sulking!

352
00:40:19,008 --> 00:40:20,296
I'm not sulking.

353
00:40:22,339 --> 00:40:27,598
Please, Dioneo.
Look at me.

354
00:40:28,699 --> 00:40:30,023
Look at me.

355
00:40:32,672 --> 00:40:35,208
I didn't mean to call
you a filthy beast.

356
00:40:36,355 --> 00:40:39,377
A sweetie pear.
and little honey cucumber.

357
00:40:39,983 --> 00:40:43,880
Please, I'm not a child,
or a cucumber.

358
00:40:45,166 --> 00:40:49,079
I love you.
I love you, cucumber.

359
00:40:49,533 --> 00:40:51,731
-I love you.
-It was only a dream.

360
00:40:53,015 --> 00:40:55,286
I would never be unfaithful
to you, you know that.

361
00:40:56,498 --> 00:41:02,589
It’s like being licked by a dog
when you do that, it really is.

362
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:09,553
Listen to me,
I love you and I forgive you.

363
00:41:12,049 --> 00:41:15,682
Look. Your forgiven
with a proper kiss.

364
00:41:19,518 --> 00:41:21,144
And another.

365
00:41:25,737 --> 00:41:27,100
And another.

366
00:41:32,209 --> 00:41:34,065
And another.

367
00:41:41,536 --> 00:41:43,049
Dioneo.

368
00:41:43,392 --> 00:41:44,979
Stop this now.

369
00:41:45,436 --> 00:41:46,721
Me?

370
00:41:48,044 --> 00:41:51,487
Dio, kiss me.

371
00:41:52,284 --> 00:41:53,913
Kiss me.

372
00:41:56,568 --> 00:41:59,974
My God.
What’s that?

373
00:42:02,473 --> 00:42:04,251
What do you think it is?

374
00:42:08,527 --> 00:42:12,387
When we're married, soon.
You'll see.

375
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:15,413
What a treasure I
have for you.

376
00:42:18,706 --> 00:42:21,467
Give me Give me..
Give me the treasure!

377
00:42:22,416 --> 00:42:24,988
Give me the treasure!
Please.

378
00:42:29,454 --> 00:42:32,517
What's happening? Dioneo!
What's going on?

379
00:42:37,672 --> 00:42:39,791
My God!
What happened?

380
00:42:40,626 --> 00:42:42,290
Nothing. Nothing.

381
00:42:43,237 --> 00:42:46,092
It may be nothing to you,
Dioneo Dugalante,

382
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,323
but it’s a disgrace and
humiliating to me!

383
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:51,372
One kiss and look
what you've done!

384
00:42:52,810 --> 00:42:55,284
You had your hand.
Get out of my loot.

385
00:42:56,144 --> 00:42:58,833
I did nothing of the sort.
That's the trouble with you.

386
00:42:59,438 --> 00:43:00,526
You just don't know
when to stop.

387
00:43:01,113 --> 00:43:02,738
Hello my little crazy flower.

388
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:06,902
Good show.

389
00:43:28,125 --> 00:43:30,887
This way please.

390
00:43:31,832 --> 00:43:33,082
Melissa!

391
00:43:34,803 --> 00:43:36,359
I am Alessandro Felice.

392
00:43:36,987 --> 00:43:38,045
And I am your host.

393
00:43:38,492 --> 00:43:39,376
Welcome.

394
00:43:40,111 --> 00:43:42,343
You're not our host and
we are not your guests.

395
00:43:42,878 --> 00:43:45,067
We are your prisoners.

396
00:43:46,167 --> 00:43:52,409
Show us your body. So beautiful.
The world is waiting for girls like you.

397
00:43:53,167 --> 00:43:55,001
Have you travelled?

398
00:43:57,462 --> 00:43:58,129
I've been to Sienna.

399
00:43:58,806 --> 00:44:00,318
Sienna?

400
00:44:04,293 --> 00:44:07,699
Then you must come with me to Tunisia.
You'll like it there.

401
00:44:09,324 --> 00:44:11,747
-Where is Tunisia?
-Africa.

402
00:44:13,802 --> 00:44:16,966
-Why are you going to Africa?
-What did she just say.

403
00:44:17,765 --> 00:44:20,261
And to work.
Of course.

404
00:44:21,056 --> 00:44:23,025
What you mean, work?

405
00:44:24,401 --> 00:44:26,133
It's easy.
It's relaxing work.

406
00:44:27,496 --> 00:44:29,238
You'll will spend most of
the time on your back.

407
00:44:29,853 --> 00:44:32,501
-Over my dead body.
-That can be always be arranged.

408
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:39,887
My god... He wants to...?

409
00:44:41,326 --> 00:44:43,483
That is what he
means isn't it?

410
00:44:44,731 --> 00:44:46,170
What are we gonna do?

411
00:44:47,913 --> 00:44:50,257
Did you see the
way he looked at us?

412
00:44:53,112 --> 00:44:56,138
He's handsome.
He's sexy.

413
00:44:57,652 --> 00:44:59,241
What do you mean?

414
00:45:00,264 --> 00:45:03,442
Look, if you want to get out of here alive,
we've just have to take control.

415
00:45:03,477 --> 00:45:06,242
Lead the dickheads
by the nose.

416
00:45:33,841 --> 00:45:38,495
These is what commonly known...
as a Chef Palace.

417
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,529
Sit down and
be a good boy.

418
00:45:47,926 --> 00:45:48,880
Put these on.

419
00:45:51,577 --> 00:45:52,193
You’re next.

420
00:45:56,288 --> 00:46:00,376
I will not... I will not... relinquish..

421
00:46:00,411 --> 00:46:04,689
My precious...precious...
jewel.

422
00:46:06,066 --> 00:46:12,576
Not until my Diana...
meet my Apollo...

423
00:46:13,974 --> 00:46:18,393
And the goddess
Venus carries me...

424
00:46:19,301 --> 00:46:21,402
Oh please carry me.

425
00:46:22,187 --> 00:46:25,781
to the threshold...
of my Jupiter.

426
00:46:27,448 --> 00:46:29,188
Who are these guys?

427
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:31,989
Like...You.

428
00:46:36,153 --> 00:46:40,315
I have waited... longing...

429
00:46:40,350 --> 00:46:45,475
But still, my Jupiter
has not come.

430
00:46:47,101 --> 00:46:49,296
I pray him to come.

431
00:46:50,282 --> 00:46:52,833
Yearn him to come.

432
00:46:54,723 --> 00:46:59,113
You, my delicious ?.

433
00:46:59,910 --> 00:47:02,633
You are my Jupiter.

434
00:47:15,246 --> 00:47:19,825
Filomena. Please don't let them
take me away. I need a wee!

435
00:47:20,052 --> 00:47:21,755
Oh shut up, stupid fart!

436
00:47:22,492 --> 00:47:23,081
You have to hold on!

437
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:27,886
-What happened?
-It was boring.

438
00:47:28,482 --> 00:47:29,568
All he wanted to do was look.

439
00:47:29,954 --> 00:47:32,600
Made me dance around the pole
without my knickers and that was it.

440
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:36,069
Where did you get that?

441
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,426
-I'm next.
-Follow me, do actually as I do. Got it?

442
00:47:45,456 --> 00:47:46,779
Gentlemen.

443
00:47:47,627 --> 00:47:49,180
Gentlemen!

444
00:47:49,333 --> 00:47:51,907
Your captain has us to
you for your delight.

445
00:47:52,616 --> 00:47:53,544
For you delight!

446
00:47:54,416 --> 00:47:54,841
Hurray.

447
00:47:58,678 --> 00:48:00,913
This is the lovely
Filomena.

448
00:48:01,858 --> 00:48:04,211
A rad beauty I'll
think you'll agree.

449
00:48:04,705 --> 00:48:07,544
Have you ever seen
such glorious breasts?

450
00:48:08,022 --> 00:48:09,847
Show them.

451
00:48:14,732 --> 00:48:17,986
-They like it!
-Gentlemen, let hear it for Filomena's breasts.

452
00:48:20,597 --> 00:48:24,913
Now, every pussy knows that
there is only one thing matters.

453
00:48:26,086 --> 00:48:28,103
Who get to go first...

454
00:48:28,104 --> 00:48:29,945
And the one to go last.

455
00:48:30,628 --> 00:48:32,838
Who is the biggest
tomcat in town?

456
00:48:33,343 --> 00:48:36,748
Me, Me, Me, Me!

457
00:48:37,357 --> 00:48:40,356
There is only one way to do it.
Off. Get them off.

458
00:48:41,158 --> 00:48:42,972
Let's get a look at the tackle.

459
00:48:43,707 --> 00:48:46,606
Come along. Come along,
in a line, in a line.

460
00:48:46,793 --> 00:48:49,480
All boys together.
Don't be shy.

461
00:48:49,583 --> 00:48:53,796
On the count to three, you big butch bandits.
Drop those loons.

462
00:48:54,250 --> 00:48:55,167
One

463
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:57,408
Two!

464
00:48:58,694 --> 00:49:00,058
Three!

465
00:49:02,329 --> 00:49:04,485
Wonderful...
Magnificent.

466
00:49:05,168 --> 00:49:08,083
Behold... manhood
in all its glory.

467
00:49:08,764 --> 00:49:10,693
God, I never seen
one before!

468
00:49:10,728 --> 00:49:15,272
-Now there's a whole army of them!
-Let's take a closer look.

469
00:49:17,882 --> 00:49:21,630
Order, please, order.
You, stand up straight!

470
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:23,335
Let me see.

471
00:49:23,523 --> 00:49:27,383
I think you should swap
places with him.

472
00:49:30,674 --> 00:49:33,059
And you with him.

473
00:49:34,966 --> 00:49:36,291
Better.

474
00:49:38,713 --> 00:49:40,303
Where is it?

475
00:49:42,045 --> 00:49:44,352
Oh, there is it.

476
00:49:45,337 --> 00:49:46,539
That's very small...

477
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:48,174
and shivery.

478
00:49:51,961 --> 00:49:54,494
-I hope theirs not all like that?
-Thanks very much.

479
00:49:55,064 --> 00:49:57,333
Looks like the end.
Don't you, Melissa?

480
00:49:58,659 --> 00:50:00,891
Off you go,
chop chop.

481
00:50:02,752 --> 00:50:04,716
Wonderful display,
well done everyone.

482
00:50:05,245 --> 00:50:05,752
Now this is it.

483
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:07,964
The moment you've
all been waiting for.

484
00:50:08,498 --> 00:50:11,490
Who goes first?

485
00:50:12,283 --> 00:50:15,046
We do, start with the biggest
and work your way down.

486
00:50:15,501 --> 00:50:18,302
No, start small and
work your way up.

487
00:50:19,514 --> 00:50:22,352
Start in the middle and
work your way out.

488
00:50:24,055 --> 00:50:27,537
-I'm the smallest, I go first.
-You want first, then last?

489
00:50:27,993 --> 00:50:29,823
Watch what you say,
big knob!

490
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:32,966
-Your asking for a thump.
-Try this for size.

491
00:50:34,744 --> 00:50:37,014
Right, that's it.

492
00:50:45,314 --> 00:50:46,603
Gino!

493
00:50:50,408 --> 00:50:54,433
Me next. Come on Gino,
Cone one. Hurry up!

494
00:50:56,167 --> 00:50:57,751
Having fun?

495
00:50:58,899 --> 00:51:01,981
What does it mean
"of your dead body".

496
00:51:05,196 --> 00:51:06,976
Naughty man.

497
00:51:21,925 --> 00:51:24,651
<i>Now comes the news
she didn't wanted to hear. </i>

498
00:51:25,143 --> 00:51:27,073
<i>The Count has arrived in Florence.</i>

499
00:51:30,519 --> 00:51:33,203
<i>Now Pampinea has a dilemma.</i>

500
00:51:33,238 --> 00:51:37,177
<i>How does she feels about feeling
leaving Lorenzo alone with all those nuns?</i>

501
00:51:37,212 --> 00:51:39,107
How to you know this?

502
00:51:39,142 --> 00:51:41,531
I heard him,
singing in the garden.

503
00:51:42,893 --> 00:51:44,938
-You are certain?
-Very.

504
00:51:51,029 --> 00:51:52,592
He has a beautiful voice.

505
00:51:54,258 --> 00:51:55,400
It'll just be hard to resist.

506
00:51:57,918 --> 00:52:00,795
Goodbye and Thank you.

507
00:52:19,029 --> 00:52:24,855
The butcher arrived. He brought a knife.
A very sharp knife.

508
00:52:25,992 --> 00:52:28,807
His ready to cut off your...

509
00:52:28,842 --> 00:52:31,115
Please!

510
00:52:38,646 --> 00:52:40,272
A miracle!

511
00:52:41,182 --> 00:52:43,150
I can speak!

512
00:52:45,151 --> 00:52:46,151
Get out!

513
00:52:52,675 --> 00:52:54,240
Wanker.

514
00:53:36,309 --> 00:53:37,960
Are you human?

515
00:53:38,906 --> 00:53:43,486
No, I'm the spirit of this pool.
I'm enchanted.

516
00:53:44,021 --> 00:53:45,488
I thought that much.

517
00:53:46,437 --> 00:53:50,224
And...
am I now under your spell?

518
00:53:50,982 --> 00:53:55,294
Yes, now that you have drunk the water,
you're under my spell.

519
00:53:56,885 --> 00:54:01,011
Where did you come from?
Before you became an enchantment.

520
00:54:01,765 --> 00:54:04,224
-Florence.
-Where are you travelling?

521
00:54:05,059 --> 00:54:06,533
To a wedding.

522
00:54:10,108 --> 00:54:13,954
-Are you the bride?
-If I were the bride...

523
00:54:15,078 --> 00:54:18,494
on my way to be married...
Would you be the groom?

524
00:54:19,972 --> 00:54:23,378
Well, like you I'm also travelling
to a wedding but if...

525
00:54:23,568 --> 00:54:29,546
by chance you were to tell me that
your name, is Pampinea Anastasi...

526
00:54:29,813 --> 00:54:31,742
my life would be complete.

527
00:54:32,083 --> 00:54:37,418
Because without question, the most
beautiful women, I have ever seen.

528
00:54:38,670 --> 00:54:42,565
If I'm Pampinea Anastasi,
then you must be...

529
00:54:42,726 --> 00:54:45,257
Dimitri Vyacheslav
Alexander Dzerzhinski.

530
00:54:45,484 --> 00:54:50,494
First son of Alexander
Piotr Abramovich Dzerzhinski.

531
00:54:51,061 --> 00:54:53,145
From the kingdom
Novgorod and you...

532
00:54:55,511 --> 00:54:59,296
you are Pampinea Anastasi, soon to be my bride.
Is this is not true?

533
00:55:00,393 --> 00:55:02,760
No, I'm an enchantment.

534
00:55:03,876 --> 00:55:07,260
And you have answered my call.

535
00:55:07,801 --> 00:55:09,395
At that special moment....

536
00:55:10,116 --> 00:55:14,319
when a woman must make her gift.
A precious jewel.

537
00:55:14,354 --> 00:55:17,471
A treasure all women hold dear...

538
00:55:17,968 --> 00:55:20,486
the greatest gift a woman
can dictate to a man.

539
00:55:22,228 --> 00:55:24,217
Something you can't wait.

540
00:55:27,197 --> 00:55:29,655
You must tell no one
of our meeting.

541
00:55:46,767 --> 00:55:51,044
<i>Having ,
Pampinea backtrack pass the convent...</i>

542
00:55:51,079 --> 00:55:55,623
<i>just to be certain the nuns weren't
getting what she fancied for herself.</i>

543
00:56:01,490 --> 00:56:03,314
Lorenzo De Lamberti.

544
00:56:04,184 --> 00:56:06,040
Pampinea Anastasi.

545
00:56:06,918 --> 00:56:07,742
What are you doing here?

546
00:56:08,218 --> 00:56:09,031
You know, just...

547
00:56:09,641 --> 00:56:11,044
enjoying the day.

548
00:56:12,598 --> 00:56:15,020
I've been working as a gardener,
escaping the city life.

549
00:56:15,055 --> 00:56:16,269
A gardener?

550
00:56:16,304 --> 00:56:19,563
I have a strong affinity
with nature.

551
00:56:19,598 --> 00:56:20,812
Oh.

552
00:56:21,747 --> 00:56:26,033
Well good, we'll see you then.
Mingino.

553
00:56:27,594 --> 00:56:29,110
No, Wait, Wait.

554
00:56:30,966 --> 00:56:33,651
-Where're you going?
-On my way to be married.

555
00:56:34,561 --> 00:56:36,694
Yes, I heard about that.

556
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:39,680
Some short fat Russian
from Novgorod?

557
00:56:40,655 --> 00:56:44,371
I hear you're very popular...
very much in demand.

558
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:46,660
You mean Gerbino Della Ratta?

559
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:48,380
He's a turd.

560
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:52,131
I hear you want lesson for your debt.
Mingino.

561
00:56:54,030 --> 00:56:56,604
Enjoy your affinity with nature.

562
00:56:58,195 --> 00:56:59,974
Perhaps I can
come with you...!

563
00:57:02,626 --> 00:57:04,177
To be your escort.

564
00:57:05,614 --> 00:57:08,225
To deliver you safely
into the arms of your?

565
00:57:11,027 --> 00:57:13,450
<i>Like all good pilgrims,
I've followed the path.</i>

566
00:57:13,485 --> 00:57:15,638
<i>I had arrived...</i>

567
00:57:16,922 --> 00:57:17,640
<i>Heaven.</i>

568
00:57:30,707 --> 00:57:33,509
<i>They say the Mother
Superior at his convent...</i>

569
00:57:33,544 --> 00:57:36,649
<i>is a woman of unparallel
lust and randiness.</i>

570
00:57:36,684 --> 00:57:39,640
-Who's there?
-I'm a holy Father...

571
00:57:39,675 --> 00:57:43,099
in search for a place of
contemplation and prayer..

572
00:57:48,254 --> 00:57:51,055
I will take you to
the holy mother.

573
00:57:51,090 --> 00:57:55,256
-Father. Have you any clothes?
-Such as?

574
00:57:55,291 --> 00:58:00,557
-Gardening, perhaps.
-Gardening? A little.

575
00:58:00,592 --> 00:58:01,203
Good.

576
00:58:02,384 --> 00:58:05,828
All this silence you see
upon, it almost if we are....

577
00:58:06,473 --> 00:58:07,328
deaf and dumb.

578
00:58:07,626 --> 00:58:12,700
We may see many things, but we
speak nothing of them in here.

579
00:58:13,216 --> 00:58:14,356
Understand?

580
00:58:19,561 --> 00:58:21,774
Silence...
Deaf and dumb.

581
00:58:23,452 --> 00:58:26,488
And gardening.
Not quite I have in mind.

582
00:58:34,894 --> 00:58:37,956
Would you care...
for a bath?

583
00:58:38,866 --> 00:58:42,992
A bath!?
I was in.

584
00:59:14,168 --> 00:59:17,138
Perfect place for a wedding.

585
00:59:27,533 --> 00:59:28,932
Nobody's here yet,
we're the first.

586
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:33,221
Lorenzo!

587
00:59:37,383 --> 00:59:38,983
Wait, Lorenzo.

588
00:59:41,933 --> 00:59:44,507
You could stay...
just a little longer.

589
00:59:54,876 --> 00:59:58,462
Blindfold?
Is that really true?

590
00:59:59,522 --> 01:00:01,046
You were blindfolded
when you kissed her?

591
01:00:01,501 --> 01:00:02,976
When she kissed me

592
01:00:05,438 --> 01:00:07,706
You'll soon forget her,
that’s what I think.

593
01:00:08,443 --> 01:00:09,699
You'll forget her
and the kiss.

594
01:00:11,198 --> 01:00:14,035
You, Lorenzo Lamberti,
to tell the truth and all.

595
01:00:15,172 --> 01:00:17,178
You don't have
to believe me.

596
01:00:18,253 --> 01:00:20,940
How can you be in love with
a woman you'll never see?

597
01:00:22,076 --> 01:00:24,565
Simple.
It was the kiss.

598
01:00:26,792 --> 01:00:28,245
Everything was in
that one kiss.

599
01:00:31,121 --> 01:00:32,627
How'll you find her?

600
01:00:33,735 --> 01:00:36,525
This woman you never seen,
locked behind convent door?

601
01:00:40,128 --> 01:00:42,096
I don't know.

602
01:00:43,875 --> 01:00:45,541
Perhaps you’re right.

603
01:00:45,576 --> 01:00:48,039
I mean they'll not gonna let me
in that convent, that’s for sure.

604
01:00:52,553 --> 01:00:55,354
I think its best you'll
forget her, Lorenzo.

605
01:00:58,482 --> 01:00:59,632
I won't forget her.

606
01:01:16,127 --> 01:01:17,870
What if you
found her?

607
01:01:17,905 --> 01:01:22,561
What if you found her, kissed her.
And your dream dies?

608
01:01:23,544 --> 01:01:24,627
How will you feel?

609
01:01:24,966 --> 01:01:25,670
It’s not to dream.

610
01:01:26,856 --> 01:01:30,246
Lorenzo, your memory of that precious
kiss will fade, in a temptational way.

611
01:01:30,957 --> 01:01:31,699
You'll see.

612
01:01:32,623 --> 01:01:35,391
Even if I have to kiss
you myself to prove it.

613
01:01:35,426 --> 01:01:37,587
-Sounds like a challenge.
-Maybe it is.

614
01:01:38,331 --> 01:01:41,296
You'll always the girl every
boy wanted to kiss.

615
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:42,775
But?

616
01:01:43,834 --> 01:01:47,320
But... you were
always too...

617
01:01:48,299 --> 01:01:49,511
Do what?

618
01:01:52,765 --> 01:01:55,681
Too good,
too clever, too...

619
01:01:58,633 --> 01:01:59,996
Too beautiful.

620
01:02:01,510 --> 01:02:03,858
Too everything,
always out of reach.

621
01:02:06,970 --> 01:02:08,672
Why don't you kiss
me now, Lorenzo?

622
01:02:09,748 --> 01:02:12,056
To see if I can make
you better.

623
01:02:15,199 --> 01:02:18,603
You mean, all the times that I wanted
to kiss you, but never could?

624
01:02:21,988 --> 01:02:25,205
For all those times.
And more.

625
01:02:30,821 --> 01:02:32,525
Close your eyes.

626
01:02:42,026 --> 01:02:43,526
Gerbino, I know it.

627
01:02:45,569 --> 01:02:46,410
Its him!

628
01:02:47,043 --> 01:02:49,092
Run Lorenzo. Please.
He'll kill you for sure.

629
01:02:50,784 --> 01:02:52,223
Run, Run!

630
01:02:53,357 --> 01:02:56,243
Della Ratta!
You shit.

631
01:02:57,037 --> 01:02:59,157
We could smell
you coming.

632
01:03:00,476 --> 01:03:01,203
Lorenzo!

633
01:03:01,846 --> 01:03:04,532
Come on! You want to kill me?
Do it!

634
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:06,047
Come on!

635
01:03:11,876 --> 01:03:13,013
Come on.

636
01:03:15,513 --> 01:03:16,649
Give me a sword!

637
01:03:19,034 --> 01:03:20,966
Somebody gives a sword to me!

638
01:03:27,809 --> 01:03:30,344
Gerbino Della Ratta!

639
01:03:32,245 --> 01:03:34,064
Leave him!

640
01:03:35,171 --> 01:03:36,911
Leave him!

641
01:03:41,528 --> 01:03:43,314
I will not marry you.
Never!

642
01:03:44,009 --> 01:03:44,772
Not if you kill him!

643
01:03:47,481 --> 01:03:48,540
Marry him?

644
01:03:51,568 --> 01:03:52,945
Is that what this is about?

645
01:03:53,648 --> 01:03:54,627
You marrying him?

646
01:04:21,845 --> 01:04:23,775
Make a mistake,
you’re a dead man.

647
01:04:24,722 --> 01:04:28,281
Kill me today, you'll still
be a ugly shit tomorrow.

648
01:04:55,771 --> 01:04:57,476
He's in trouble, Pampinea.

649
01:04:58,346 --> 01:04:59,786
Alot of trouble.

650
01:05:00,152 --> 01:05:01,850
What kind of trouble?

651
01:05:02,501 --> 01:05:03,184
Theft.

652
01:05:04,290 --> 01:05:05,728
Murder.

653
01:05:07,206 --> 01:05:10,644
I can believe what you said,
and not first say it.

654
01:05:11,231 --> 01:05:12,122
But he's only a boy.

655
01:05:14,584 --> 01:05:15,986
Please.

656
01:05:19,985 --> 01:05:20,862
Please.

657
01:05:21,778 --> 01:05:22,432
What?

658
01:05:23,761 --> 01:05:26,031
Don't lean over.

659
01:05:34,691 --> 01:05:37,152
What are you doing?
Please.

660
01:05:38,968 --> 01:05:40,332
Listen.

661
01:05:48,619 --> 01:05:52,441
-Come down.
-Your afraid of height, aren't you?

662
01:05:53,956 --> 01:05:54,829
No.

663
01:05:57,289 --> 01:05:59,444
Just don't want
you to fall in.

664
01:06:00,054 --> 01:06:00,923
How can I fall?

665
01:06:01,323 --> 01:06:04,277
-I've been playing on this well, since I was a child.
-Just get down

666
01:06:08,408 --> 01:06:11,823
Release Lorenzo and you
can send for the priest.

667
01:06:12,762 --> 01:06:13,702
Now?

668
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:16,423
You'll marry me now?

669
01:06:19,143 --> 01:06:20,073
Yes.

670
01:06:21,245 --> 01:06:23,889
But if I marry you, and
you do not release him.

671
01:06:24,721 --> 01:06:26,154
If you have blood
on your hands...

672
01:06:26,399 --> 01:06:28,635
then you'll spend the rest
of your life in a cold bed.

673
01:06:28,663 --> 01:06:29,856
Do you understand?

674
01:06:30,709 --> 01:06:32,017
I'll give you nothing of
what I have to give.

675
01:06:35,593 --> 01:06:37,008
You have my word.

676
01:06:38,334 --> 01:06:39,695
I'll send for a priest.

677
01:06:41,473 --> 01:06:43,367
How the hell do you find
a priest just like that?

678
01:06:44,352 --> 01:06:46,397
You'll have your balls on
the block if we don't.

679
01:06:48,939 --> 01:06:51,604
-Hey, You!
-What?

680
01:06:51,639 --> 01:06:54,026
Father.
Where're you going?

681
01:06:54,061 --> 01:06:56,411
To Pampinea's house.

682
01:06:57,661 --> 01:06:58,895
To the wedding?

683
01:07:00,181 --> 01:07:03,548
How do you know we wanted a priest,
when we've just been sent to get one?

684
01:07:04,231 --> 01:07:05,895
The word of God, travel fast.

685
01:07:06,130 --> 01:07:08,313
Hey, don't I know you?

686
01:07:08,961 --> 01:07:10,360
Your face is familiar.

687
01:07:11,242 --> 01:07:13,966
It’s the clothes, all
place looks the same.

688
01:07:28,041 --> 01:07:30,539
You must go. Leave before
he changes his mind.

689
01:07:31,297 --> 01:07:32,610
Are you going to marry him?

690
01:07:33,085 --> 01:07:34,090
Not your concern.

691
01:07:36,225 --> 01:07:37,400
The priest's here.

692
01:07:38,837 --> 01:07:40,050
Leave while you can.

693
01:07:47,529 --> 01:07:49,511
He must hear the confession
before the wedding.

694
01:07:50,684 --> 01:07:51,707
I'll go first.

695
01:07:59,730 --> 01:08:03,516
So, just to be clear. How many potential
husbands you have right now?

696
01:08:04,195 --> 01:08:05,939
-Three.
-Which one do you want?

697
01:08:06,355 --> 01:08:07,346
Lorenzo!

698
01:08:07,647 --> 01:08:09,430
I love Lorenzo.

699
01:08:09,836 --> 01:08:11,853
But you not met the Count,
the one you promise to marry.

700
01:08:11,989 --> 01:08:12,946
You could fall in love with him.

701
01:08:13,181 --> 01:08:16,537
-No, only Lorenzo.
-Does he love you?

702
01:08:16,689 --> 01:08:20,700
Yes. No.
He love me but he doesn't know it yet.

703
01:08:21,647 --> 01:08:23,995
It's not easy being a priest.

704
01:08:26,908 --> 01:08:28,913
Please delay as
long as you can.

705
01:09:02,750 --> 01:09:04,113
and I realize that...

706
01:09:04,407 --> 01:09:08,292
stealing other people's money was far
easier than working for my own.

707
01:09:08,844 --> 01:09:12,626
All those killings.
How many people?

708
01:09:18,758 --> 01:09:21,636
-I can't remember.
-That's quite a list.

709
01:09:22,847 --> 01:09:24,284
Not to mention what you
did to your father.

710
01:09:32,850 --> 01:09:34,289
Do I know you?

711
01:09:36,257 --> 01:09:38,867
Your face is familiar,
I'm sure I know you.

712
01:09:40,004 --> 01:09:42,817
It’s the clothes.
All place looks the same.

713
01:09:51,106 --> 01:09:52,076
Too absolve yourself...

714
01:09:52,356 --> 01:09:56,346
from this terrible sins and
hope for an eternal salvation.

715
01:09:56,903 --> 01:09:59,668
you must abstain from all sexual
thought and all sexual deeds..

716
01:10:00,539 --> 01:10:02,203
For a period of 30 days.

717
01:10:04,250 --> 01:10:08,107
But I'm just about to be married!
How can I abstain sex for 30 day?

718
01:10:08,901 --> 01:10:11,174
That's... mean!

719
01:10:11,825 --> 01:10:13,453
and stupid.

720
01:10:13,688 --> 01:10:17,442
Well of course, if you
do something really stupid...

721
01:10:17,905 --> 01:10:20,266
then you must expect to suffer so we
can remain stupid in return...

722
01:10:20,508 --> 01:10:24,125
just to show you how stupid
you were in the first place.

723
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:26,547
It's called a penance.

724
01:10:26,582 --> 01:10:32,678
That's... really,
really stupid.

725
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:37,256
God works in
mysterious ways.

726
01:10:39,151 --> 01:10:41,762
<i>Well, I had him by the nuts...
Well for sure.</i>

727
01:10:42,291 --> 01:10:45,851
<i>But how long could I squeeze,
before he squeeze mine?</i>

728
01:10:49,567 --> 01:10:52,345
You know Gerbino sent
us along to kill you.

729
01:10:53,066 --> 01:10:54,389
I kind of guess that.

730
01:10:55,374 --> 01:10:57,343
Dirty business, killing.

731
01:10:57,378 --> 01:11:00,672
-I'd rather be a gardener.
-I know just the place.

732
01:11:00,707 --> 01:11:04,796
Listen.
We could let you go.

733
01:11:04,831 --> 01:11:08,922
-But you must promise not to tell.
-Really?

734
01:11:15,713 --> 01:11:18,552
-I promise.
-Good.

735
01:11:25,022 --> 01:11:26,575
That's hurt.

736
01:11:28,466 --> 01:11:30,397
Really, really hurt.

737
01:11:31,987 --> 01:11:35,786
Is this the road to the villa of
Pampinea Anastasi?

738
01:11:36,470 --> 01:11:38,475
-That way.
-Thank you.

739
01:11:39,722 --> 01:11:41,086
Who are you?

740
01:11:41,768 --> 01:11:46,595
I am Count Dimitri Alexander
Dzerzhinski...!

741
01:11:47,618 --> 01:11:49,699
Ah!
short, fat Russian

742
01:12:07,685 --> 01:12:09,534
Witness, all of you.

743
01:12:11,027 --> 01:12:13,902
You are Gerbino Della Ratta?

744
01:12:15,226 --> 01:12:15,886
You know who I am.

745
01:12:16,239 --> 01:12:17,428
Please don't be difficult.

746
01:12:18,104 --> 01:12:20,336
How can I marry you if you
don't answer the question?

747
01:12:22,911 --> 01:12:24,917
Are you Gerbino Della Ratta?

748
01:12:26,127 --> 01:12:27,188
I am.

749
01:12:29,193 --> 01:12:32,222
-You are Pampinea Anastasi?
-I am, Father.

750
01:12:32,941 --> 01:12:35,150
And when did you both last take confession?
Pampinea?

751
01:12:36,944 --> 01:12:38,761
I taken confession on
this day, Father.

752
01:12:39,149 --> 01:12:41,382
-Did you confess all your sins?
-I did, Father.

753
01:12:43,235 --> 01:12:44,276
Gerbino Della Ratta.

754
01:12:44,642 --> 01:12:46,008
When did you last take confession?

755
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:49,177
-You know when I last took confession.
-Bad answer.

756
01:12:49,549 --> 01:12:53,416
"I had taken confession
on this day, Father."

757
01:12:55,539 --> 01:12:58,349
-I had taken confession on this day.
-Father.

758
01:12:59,747 --> 01:13:01,147
Father.

759
01:13:02,132 --> 01:13:05,959
Then do you both come to me,
pure in body and soul. Hence I do.

760
01:13:06,143 --> 01:13:08,567
- I do.
- I do.

761
01:13:09,489 --> 01:13:11,042
- Have you bathe?
- What?!

762
01:13:11,297 --> 01:13:12,221
Pampinea?

763
01:13:12,791 --> 01:13:15,604
I have bathe, on this day of day
which is my marriage debt.

764
01:13:16,419 --> 01:13:20,743
Witness all of you, this woman come
to us pure, in both body and soul.

765
01:13:21,048 --> 01:13:22,877
Gerbino Della Ratta.

766
01:13:23,209 --> 01:13:26,263
Have you bathe on this day
of day, that is your wedding day?

767
01:13:26,332 --> 01:13:28,945
- Yes.
- When did you bathe?

768
01:13:29,436 --> 01:13:31,932
- I just told you I bathe!.
- When exactly, when did you last take a bath?

769
01:13:32,151 --> 01:13:33,496
I have bathe!

770
01:13:33,726 --> 01:13:35,963
Thoroughly? All the bits
and pieces, downstairs....

771
01:13:36,042 --> 01:13:38,251
-In between your legs?
-What?

772
01:13:38,839 --> 01:13:40,520
Show me your hands.

773
01:13:41,656 --> 01:13:44,911
-You got dirt on your nails.
-Where?

774
01:13:45,442 --> 01:13:48,468
There. I can't marry you if
you have dirty fingernails.

775
01:13:49,530 --> 01:13:52,747
That ridiculous...
I've never heard anything so ridiculous.

776
01:13:53,199 --> 01:13:58,801
I can hardly say, witness all you, this
man come to us, pure in body and soul.

777
01:13:58,836 --> 01:14:01,715
But with dirty fingernails.
Now can I?

778
01:14:01,750 --> 01:14:03,267
You must wash your hands.

779
01:14:09,035 --> 01:14:10,588
The very least.

780
01:14:22,356 --> 01:14:25,057
-There.
-Thank you.

781
01:14:30,732 --> 01:14:31,943
He only doing his job.

782
01:14:31,978 --> 01:14:33,496
Exactly.

783
01:14:34,820 --> 01:14:38,377
Incidentally, there is a
charge for my services.

784
01:14:46,822 --> 01:14:49,205
This is very jolly.

785
01:14:53,405 --> 01:14:55,185
Pour this fine wine...

786
01:15:12,441 --> 01:15:16,149
A little young, perhaps fine.
Fresh fruit, with a...

787
01:15:16,317 --> 01:15:19,422
A musty, a
musty hint...

788
01:15:21,011 --> 01:15:25,779
A musty hint of what I can
really, only describe as stale fart...

789
01:15:26,083 --> 01:15:28,959
rather like the combination of
this couple here, before me today.

790
01:15:30,456 --> 01:15:32,086
Marry us now,
you bastard.

791
01:15:32,121 --> 01:15:34,849
I declare you man and wife.
There, it’s done.

792
01:15:34,884 --> 01:15:38,444
Your married. Relax, enjoy.
Consummate, whatever you what really.

793
01:15:38,479 --> 01:15:40,072
Hey!

794
01:15:49,609 --> 01:15:52,407
I am Count Dimitri Viacheslav
Alexandrovich Dzerzhinski.

795
01:15:52,442 --> 01:15:56,812
First son of Alexander
Piotr Abramovich Dzerzhinski...

796
01:15:56,847 --> 01:16:02,074
from the kingdom of Novgorod.
I am here to marry Pampinea Anastasi.

797
01:16:02,109 --> 01:16:05,139
I will kill any man who
try to stop me.

798
01:16:05,174 --> 01:16:08,847
You’re too late.
Pampinea Anastasi is already married.

799
01:16:09,182 --> 01:16:10,698
This is my wife.

800
01:16:11,437 --> 01:16:13,687
This is house.
This is my land.

801
01:16:13,722 --> 01:16:16,153
I'll advise you while you
still have air to breathe.

802
01:16:16,188 --> 01:16:17,952
This lady may be your wife.

803
01:16:18,161 --> 01:16:21,018
But I'm sorry to tell you, she'll
about to become a widow.

804
01:16:22,381 --> 01:16:23,783
You piece of rat.

805
01:16:24,084 --> 01:16:27,098
You took 4 men who
were close to my heart.

806
01:16:27,300 --> 01:16:28,397
You stole their lives.

807
01:16:28,598 --> 01:16:30,571
Now you must pay!

808
01:16:40,773 --> 01:16:42,099
Lorenzo!

809
01:16:51,878 --> 01:16:53,355
Run!

810
01:17:17,062 --> 01:17:19,032
-Here we go?
-I don't know.

811
01:17:20,207 --> 01:17:22,059
-You go that way, I go this way.
-Who are you?

812
01:17:22,594 --> 01:17:24,028
Lorenzo Lamberti.

813
01:17:25,203 --> 01:17:28,268
The robber on the road. Yes!
I am Count Dimitri Alexander...

814
01:17:28,303 --> 01:17:30,122
I know, I know.

815
01:17:31,485 --> 01:17:33,063
First son!

816
01:17:33,864 --> 01:17:36,180
Only son.
Nine sisters.

817
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:43,973
Gerbino Della Ratta.

818
01:18:14,721 --> 01:18:16,461
Get her and bring
her to me.

819
01:18:36,590 --> 01:18:38,293
Kill them and throw
them down to me.

820
01:18:38,460 --> 01:18:39,510
Hello.

821
01:18:40,811 --> 01:18:44,949
Tell me...
Are you ready to die?

822
01:19:05,599 --> 01:19:07,248
You dropped your
little sword.

823
01:19:08,255 --> 01:19:08,968
Pick it up.

824
01:19:10,199 --> 01:19:11,528
Fight me.

825
01:19:11,763 --> 01:19:13,944
Fight me or I'll kill
you anyway.

826
01:19:14,147 --> 01:19:15,615
Wait.

827
01:19:17,150 --> 01:19:18,643
We have unfinished business.

828
01:19:20,045 --> 01:19:21,674
Is that not right,
Gerbino?

829
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:25,800
You want to kill me?
Why don't you come up here and join me?

830
01:19:25,835 --> 01:19:27,879
I'm sorry my friend.
I've sworned to kill this man.

831
01:19:27,914 --> 01:19:31,174
You kill him before I kill him,
I may have to kill you.

832
01:19:31,409 --> 01:19:34,164
Here, let this decide.

833
01:19:42,218 --> 01:19:44,187
Alright, if you want.

834
01:19:45,945 --> 01:19:47,381
Why not join him.

835
01:19:48,289 --> 01:19:49,316
I'll fight him.

836
01:19:51,098 --> 01:19:52,101
But don't step in.

837
01:19:55,331 --> 01:19:57,484
I may step in.

838
01:19:59,050 --> 01:20:00,371
I may step out.

839
01:20:02,029 --> 01:20:05,324
I may even decide to have
a little dance with you.

840
01:20:06,986 --> 01:20:08,102
Do not worry my friend.

841
01:20:09,273 --> 01:20:11,711
If he kills you,
I'll kim him, either way.

842
01:20:12,243 --> 01:20:13,147
You're going to die.

843
01:20:45,234 --> 01:20:47,542
Do you need help
getting up?

844
01:21:34,644 --> 01:21:37,446
Kill him... Kill him!

845
01:21:37,481 --> 01:21:39,793
Put your sword into his heart!

846
01:21:42,592 --> 01:21:45,013
Still a gambler, Gerbino.
Want to make a bet?

847
01:21:45,048 --> 01:21:47,512
Go that way, you’re dead.

848
01:21:47,547 --> 01:21:50,653
Come this way to me, dead.

849
01:21:50,688 --> 01:21:54,362
Go that way...
But who knows?

850
01:22:13,524 --> 01:22:15,530
Going down.

851
01:22:15,565 --> 01:22:18,293
Shit!

852
01:22:32,219 --> 01:22:34,794
Friend.
Take my advice.

853
01:22:34,829 --> 01:22:37,860
Do not drink water
from this well.

854
01:22:42,930 --> 01:22:44,480
Sorry.

855
01:22:50,698 --> 01:22:53,611
-So that one's Lorenzo?
-Yes.

856
01:22:53,646 --> 01:22:59,741
By the way I'm not really a priest.
So you're already married.

857
01:23:08,824 --> 01:23:13,327
-Count Dzerzhinski!
-Pampinea Anastasi.

858
01:23:14,691 --> 01:23:21,803
I have travelled here to you,
from my beloved Novogrod.

859
01:23:21,838 --> 01:23:24,342
To make you my wife.

860
01:23:25,514 --> 01:23:27,113
I'm here.
Hello.

861
01:23:27,148 --> 01:23:32,653
Count Dzerzhinski. You are one of the bravest,
most handsome men I've ever met.

862
01:23:32,688 --> 01:23:34,357
Yes, I know.

863
01:23:34,392 --> 01:23:36,172
But I cannot marry you.

864
01:23:43,667 --> 01:23:47,529
How can you say this after
everything that happened between us?

865
01:23:49,308 --> 01:23:52,185
What do you mean? I don't understand.
What exactly happened between us?

866
01:23:53,324 --> 01:23:56,386
But...You are not
Pampinea Anastasi.

867
01:23:58,705 --> 01:24:03,661
-She... is Pampinea Anastasi..
-Melissa!

868
01:24:05,792 --> 01:24:08,099
-You know her?
-Know her?

869
01:24:10,045 --> 01:24:11,344
I am in love with her.

870
01:24:23,178 --> 01:24:25,940
Melissa, really,
kissing a perfect stranger.

871
01:24:28,174 --> 01:24:29,838
This doesn't look much like a wedding,
what's going on?

872
01:24:30,386 --> 01:24:32,115
Filomena, there is going
to be a wedding!

873
01:24:32,565 --> 01:24:34,418
I hope there is going
to be a wedding.

874
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:36,731
Lorenzo

875
01:24:38,193 --> 01:24:39,067
Where are you?

876
01:24:50,813 --> 01:24:52,252
Lorenzo!

877
01:24:58,316 --> 01:24:59,146
Lorenzo

878
01:25:08,464 --> 01:25:09,435
Lorenzo

879
01:25:10,602 --> 01:25:13,100
You have stolen my heart.
I love you.

880
01:25:18,664 --> 01:25:19,810
I love you.

881
01:25:23,747 --> 01:25:24,769
Pampinea...

882
01:25:25,470 --> 01:25:27,834
You're one of the most..
No.

883
01:25:30,673 --> 01:25:35,636
The most beautiful girl,
I ever seen.

884
01:25:35,887 --> 01:25:39,151
But I gave my heart to a kiss,
I can't let go.

885
01:25:41,005 --> 01:25:44,979
If only I can forget her...
I must find her.

886
01:25:48,772 --> 01:25:52,218
Lorenzo, close your eyes.
Please.

887
01:25:53,429 --> 01:25:55,550
Just close your eyes.

888
01:26:05,008 --> 01:26:07,468
Every day I see you...
I'm drawn to you.

889
01:26:07,503 --> 01:26:11,063
Every night as I come
beyond for you.

890
01:26:13,563 --> 01:26:16,598
Every day.
Every night.

891
01:26:29,439 --> 01:26:30,690
You...

892
01:26:34,091 --> 01:26:35,423
With You.

893
01:26:37,862 --> 01:26:41,056
Now will you forget her?
This girl you kissed?

894
01:26:43,403 --> 01:26:44,956
Never.

895
01:27:06,104 --> 01:27:08,489
<i>This is my reward.</i>

896
01:27:08,690 --> 01:27:10,731
<i>I get to stand of
here like a daisy....</i>

897
01:27:11,091 --> 01:27:12,102
<i>While this lot...</i>

898
01:27:12,507 --> 01:27:15,449
<i>Well, you can see
for yourselves.</i>

899
01:27:17,207 --> 01:27:21,658
So tra la tra la,
Heads up...oohh

900
01:27:24,877 --> 01:27:26,426
<i>Romance.</i>

901
01:27:26,461 --> 01:27:28,055
<i>Passion.</i>

902
01:27:31,501 --> 01:27:35,134
<i>Alright, to hell with this.
I'm back off to the convent.</i>

903
01:27:36,119 --> 01:27:39,306
<i>There's an angel there and
her bottom got my name on it</i>

904
01:27:44,491 --> 01:27:46,270
Close your eyes together.

905
01:27:47,305 --> 01:27:48,438
No...

906
01:27:49,939 --> 01:27:51,702
You close yours.
