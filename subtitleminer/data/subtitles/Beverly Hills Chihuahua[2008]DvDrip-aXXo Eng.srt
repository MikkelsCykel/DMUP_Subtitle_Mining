1
00:01:53,293 --> 00:01:54,954
She's on her way.

2
00:02:09,976 --> 00:02:11,443
Good morning, Viv.

3
00:02:11,511 --> 00:02:13,911
Hello, Willow. Lovely to see you.

4
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,347
- Here she comes!
- Is that the new Louis Vuitton?

5
00:02:17,417 --> 00:02:19,715
I might've known
she'd be the first.

6
00:02:19,786 --> 00:02:22,880
Fabulous bag. She's so chic.

7
00:02:24,891 --> 00:02:28,224
Sorry I'm late.
We had to do a little shopping.

8
00:02:28,295 --> 00:02:31,423
Now that's the way to travel.
I'm so jealous.

9
00:02:31,498 --> 00:02:32,965
Faboo!

10
00:02:33,033 --> 00:02:35,007
Louis Vuitton
never looked so good.

11
00:02:35,569 --> 00:02:38,936
Mmm. Tell me the stones
in that collar are not real.

12
00:02:39,005 --> 00:02:42,532
Aren't they gorgeous?
Viv said I had to have it.

13
00:02:43,844 --> 00:02:46,608
- Sorry keep you waiting.
- Armand, it's fine.

14
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,080
A brush and a seaweed wrap,
but I need her by noon.

15
00:02:49,149 --> 00:02:52,482
- We're having lunch with my niece.
- She'll be ready.

16
00:02:52,552 --> 00:02:56,488
I know, sweetheart. I'm going to miss
you, too. You take good care of her.

17
00:02:56,556 --> 00:02:59,320
- No waxing, OK?
- OK, no waxing for her.

18
00:02:59,392 --> 00:03:02,623
I hope she gives me a red bow.
I want to look my best today.

19
00:03:02,696 --> 00:03:05,893
- Bimini has a date with Scooter.
- Nice pedigree.

20
00:03:05,966 --> 00:03:08,935
Please! The dog chases parked cars.

21
00:03:09,002 --> 00:03:12,904
- He's crazier than a Labradoodle.
- I give it a week, tops.

22
00:03:12,973 --> 00:03:16,374
- Hey! Talk to the paw.
- Good for you, Bimini.

23
00:03:16,443 --> 00:03:21,380
It's not easy to find a mate with
papers. Let alone one you could love.

24
00:03:21,448 --> 00:03:26,044
Me, I'd be happy with
one who's not... fixed.

25
00:03:33,393 --> 00:03:34,690
Down, boy.

26
00:03:42,569 --> 00:03:44,127
All right, what's next?

27
00:03:44,471 --> 00:03:46,871
- What do you think?
- Please. She wears Harry Winston.

28
00:03:48,475 --> 00:03:49,567
Viv?

29
00:03:49,643 --> 00:03:51,941
Fabulous. I'll take two.
You should see Chloe.

30
00:03:52,078 --> 00:03:56,981
I'll need at least two days at corporate
in New York to meet with buyers.

31
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:59,211
- You have a little beret?
- Perfection.

32
00:04:00,921 --> 00:04:03,014
Who needs sleep? It's Italy.

33
00:04:03,757 --> 00:04:04,951
Preppy little beauty.

34
00:04:05,091 --> 00:04:07,423
- This just came in.
- She's allergic to wool. No.

35
00:04:08,929 --> 00:04:11,955
- Love that.
- Oh! Fabulous!

36
00:04:12,766 --> 00:04:15,428
- Viv.
- I love it. And do you love it?

37
00:04:15,835 --> 00:04:19,066
You may have it.
I'll get you anything you want.

38
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:22,165
Yes, I will. No, not you, Patrick.

39
00:04:23,043 --> 00:04:25,568
Hello, Jackie O.

40
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:41,418
- Love the smell of dirt in the morning.
- Sam, the garden looks gorgeous.

41
00:04:41,494 --> 00:04:44,986
And I love the new designs
for the waterfall that you did.

42
00:04:45,065 --> 00:04:46,726
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

43
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,701
For everything. For giving me
a chance to prove myself.

44
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:53,496
Oh, good job, Papi. Very symmetrical.

45
00:04:55,642 --> 00:04:57,007
<i>Ciao. Ciao,</i> Papi.

46
00:04:58,044 --> 00:05:02,947
Yes, yes. We did it, Papi.
Yes. Yes!

47
00:05:03,016 --> 00:05:05,951
Go on, take a break, Papi.
You're doing great, buddy.

48
00:05:15,228 --> 00:05:17,093
Hello, beautiful.

49
00:05:18,498 --> 00:05:20,227
You're blocking my sun.

50
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:24,168
<i># Mi corazón, you shine</i>
<i>much brighter than the sun</i>

51
00:05:24,704 --> 00:05:27,264
<i># Why won't you be my one #

52
00:05:28,975 --> 00:05:31,102
- What's that smell?
- Which one?

53
00:05:32,045 --> 00:05:34,946
The sweat of my labor
or the mint patch I rolled in for you?

54
00:05:35,015 --> 00:05:38,542
- Neither.
- Then it must be the fertilizer.

55
00:05:38,618 --> 00:05:41,985
Gross! You're covered in it.

56
00:05:42,055 --> 00:05:45,183
Of course. I am a landscaper.

57
00:05:48,795 --> 00:05:50,228
Grasshopper, <i>mi corazón?</i>

58
00:05:50,997 --> 00:05:53,795
I caught it myself. Very tasty.

59
00:05:53,867 --> 00:05:56,927
Papi, that's so... disgusting.

60
00:05:57,003 --> 00:06:00,734
I see you're tempted. I'll leave it here
in case you change your mind.

61
00:06:00,807 --> 00:06:03,037
Excuse me. We have guests.

62
00:06:03,109 --> 00:06:05,236
Guests? You got guests... OK.

63
00:06:06,046 --> 00:06:09,880
You want to go have a drink later?
There's a great puddle by the garage.

64
00:06:09,949 --> 00:06:11,644
OK, never mind.

65
00:06:11,718 --> 00:06:13,879
Aunt Viv! I'm here!

66
00:06:13,953 --> 00:06:15,784
An hour late, as usual.

67
00:06:15,855 --> 00:06:17,447
Aunt Viv, hello!

68
00:06:17,524 --> 00:06:21,051
How do you keep a job?
Oh, that's right, you don't.

69
00:06:21,127 --> 00:06:25,029
Where's Aunt Viv?
Where's Aunt Viv? Chloe, go find her.

70
00:06:25,098 --> 00:06:28,966
- Go on. Go find her.
- Who am I, Lassie?

71
00:06:29,035 --> 00:06:30,969
You're so completely useless.

72
00:06:31,037 --> 00:06:33,164
Of course I understand.

73
00:06:33,239 --> 00:06:36,970
It's just that I'm headed to
Europe to promote my new cosmetic line.

74
00:06:37,043 --> 00:06:39,876
No, this is wonderful news.
It's the best news.

75
00:06:39,946 --> 00:06:42,676
Yes, yes. OK. Wonderful. Bye.

76
00:06:44,718 --> 00:06:48,779
- Is everything OK, Aunt Viv?
- I don't know what I'm going to do.

77
00:06:48,855 --> 00:06:53,155
I am getting on a plane at 4:00,
and I gave the staff the week off...

78
00:06:53,226 --> 00:06:56,627
and Chloe's dog nanny just
had her baby three weeks early.

79
00:06:56,696 --> 00:06:59,790
- You're not taking Chloe with you?
- No, no.

80
00:06:59,866 --> 00:07:04,735
Obviously if it was a vacation,
of course, but this is a business trip.

81
00:07:04,804 --> 00:07:06,999
Four cities in ten days.

82
00:07:07,073 --> 00:07:10,873
She's much too delicate for that kind
of travel. Plus she hates Berlin.

83
00:07:10,944 --> 00:07:13,139
- What about a kennel?
- Kennel?

84
00:07:13,213 --> 00:07:14,942
No.

85
00:07:15,014 --> 00:07:18,506
No, no. I could never leave her
in the hands of strangers.

86
00:07:18,585 --> 00:07:21,213
Never in a million years.

87
00:07:22,288 --> 00:07:23,755
But you're not a stranger.

88
00:07:25,925 --> 00:07:27,756
- What?
- What?

89
00:07:29,462 --> 00:07:33,592
Here is Chloe's schedule.
Try to stay to it as much as possible.

90
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:35,497
I could skip the dog park on Wednesday

91
00:07:35,568 --> 00:07:38,264
because Chloe's friend, Stella,
came down with fleas.

92
00:07:38,972 --> 00:07:42,703
I'm about to entrust you with
my greatest treasure.

93
00:07:42,776 --> 00:07:45,108
Take good care.

94
00:07:45,178 --> 00:07:46,907
I love you, sweetheart.

95
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:50,279
I love you so much.
Mommy loves you so much.

96
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:52,750
Bye-bye! Have fun, you two!

97
00:07:52,819 --> 00:07:55,413
OK. Bye!

98
00:07:56,923 --> 00:07:58,288
Playdate?

99
00:08:03,329 --> 00:08:05,229
Here you go. Good luck.

100
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:30,153
Don't worry, Chloe.
Viv will be back before you know it.

101
00:08:30,223 --> 00:08:31,918
Rachel doesn't look so bad.

102
00:08:31,991 --> 00:08:34,084
You don't know the half of it.

103
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,788
They all look so cute
in their little outfits.

104
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:39,229
You didn't have to dress her.
She's so picky.

105
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:43,201
- You're talking about a Chihuahua.
- She's not any Chihuahua, Angela.

106
00:08:43,736 --> 00:08:48,901
She's a bossy, arrogant, manipulative,
Beverly Hills Chihuahua.

107
00:08:48,975 --> 00:08:52,911
She has no direction. She can't keep
a job. She's never on time.

108
00:08:52,979 --> 00:08:55,004
I'm going to be late to my appointments.

109
00:08:55,081 --> 00:08:57,106
Don't get me started on her schedule.

110
00:08:57,183 --> 00:09:00,380
Shiatsu massages, doggy birthday
parties, couture fittings.

111
00:09:00,453 --> 00:09:02,887
I have to change
her outfit four times a day.

112
00:09:02,956 --> 00:09:04,685
I mean, look at her.

113
00:09:04,757 --> 00:09:06,452
She's so...

114
00:09:06,526 --> 00:09:08,426
...irresponsible.
...spoiled.

115
00:09:08,595 --> 00:09:10,187
Woof.

116
00:09:10,263 --> 00:09:12,823
- I need to cool off.
- Dive in, girl.

117
00:09:16,502 --> 00:09:17,491
Whoa!

118
00:09:17,871 --> 00:09:19,429
Hi, <i>mami.</i>

119
00:09:19,505 --> 00:09:20,529
Oh!

120
00:09:20,607 --> 00:09:23,041
Who is that hunk
of Chihuahua over there?

121
00:09:23,109 --> 00:09:25,100
- Nice.
- <i>Mi corazón!</i>

122
00:09:25,178 --> 00:09:27,009
The gardener.

123
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,377
You are more lovely...

124
00:09:29,148 --> 00:09:31,082
- than the dawn.
- Wow.

125
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:32,378
<i>Mi corazón!</i>

126
00:09:33,052 --> 00:09:36,920
<i>You are more lovely...</i>
than the dawn!

127
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:40,118
So embarrassing. Maybe he'll go away.

128
00:09:41,294 --> 00:09:42,283
I only...

129
00:09:42,829 --> 00:09:47,163
Excuse me while I bravely defend
your garden against that dangerous bird.

130
00:09:48,067 --> 00:09:49,056
Hey, bird!

131
00:09:49,903 --> 00:09:52,565
That is one hot dog.

132
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,573
Excuse me.
Coming through. Nice legs.

133
00:09:56,576 --> 00:09:58,339
Mud all over me.

134
00:09:58,411 --> 00:10:01,642
Hey, hey! Excuse me!

135
00:10:01,714 --> 00:10:04,581
Excuse me! Excuse me, <i>señor?</i>
Gardener guy?

136
00:10:06,052 --> 00:10:10,216
Your dog is <i>muy</i> bad.
<i>Muy, muy, muy</i> bad. <i>Mucho</i> naughty.

137
00:10:15,395 --> 00:10:17,488
Can you get... your...

138
00:10:18,531 --> 00:10:20,431
...doggie-o out of here?

139
00:10:21,367 --> 00:10:24,393
<i>Perdóname, por favor,</i>
but my heart must speak.

140
00:10:25,338 --> 00:10:27,431
I only wish to say...

141
00:10:27,507 --> 00:10:31,500
that if you ever need someone
to lick inside your ears...

142
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:35,445
or chew the hard to reach places...

143
00:10:35,515 --> 00:10:38,484
or share your slumber in the sun...

144
00:10:39,185 --> 00:10:42,279
I would be most honored
to be that special someone.

145
00:10:42,355 --> 00:10:46,018
- Woof.
- Put your tongue back in your mouth.

146
00:10:46,793 --> 00:10:51,560
Oh. I don't think so, Papi.

147
00:10:51,631 --> 00:10:53,690
You mean, not now.

148
00:10:54,367 --> 00:10:57,029
I mean... not ever.

149
00:10:58,137 --> 00:11:02,301
I see. Of course. Well...

150
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:03,501
This thing.

151
00:11:06,312 --> 00:11:08,303
Papi!

152
00:11:09,048 --> 00:11:12,950
Duty calls! Please have
a most wonderful day.

153
00:11:21,227 --> 00:11:23,024
Cool. Thanks a lot.

154
00:11:32,438 --> 00:11:35,032
Rachel, wake up.
I've got a mani-pedi at 11:00,

155
00:11:35,108 --> 00:11:37,235
and you have to make my waffles.

156
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:39,301
Get up!

157
00:11:52,792 --> 00:11:54,054
Aunt Viv's.

158
00:11:55,028 --> 00:11:57,258
Hi, Angela.

159
00:11:59,565 --> 00:12:00,623
What?

160
00:12:01,701 --> 00:12:03,328
You're a genius.

161
00:12:03,403 --> 00:12:06,497
Yes, I can be ready
in 30 minutes. OK, bye!

162
00:12:08,307 --> 00:12:11,140
Pack your swimsuit, Chloe.
We're going on a trip.

163
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:14,475
A trip? Ooh, where are we going?

164
00:12:15,415 --> 00:12:19,078
Mexico! Yeah!

165
00:12:36,769 --> 00:12:38,999
I love this town!

166
00:12:43,109 --> 00:12:45,771
- Let's check it out.
- Surfer boys, hi!

167
00:12:46,112 --> 00:12:47,306
Hi.

168
00:12:51,818 --> 00:12:53,445
I love this town!

169
00:12:54,387 --> 00:12:57,356
I could totally live here.
Isn't this great?

170
00:12:57,423 --> 00:13:00,824
I'm starting to get the feeling
there's no Four Seasons here.

171
00:13:03,429 --> 00:13:04,760
Whoo!

172
00:13:21,147 --> 00:13:23,138
- Third floor, baby.
- Woo!

173
00:13:24,851 --> 00:13:28,150
Hello? Somebody forget something?

174
00:13:28,221 --> 00:13:30,883
- I'm walking by myself.
- Chloe!

175
00:13:35,595 --> 00:13:38,621
I'm starving.
What's taking them so long?

176
00:13:38,998 --> 00:13:41,523
Wait. What time are
we supposed to meet the guys?

177
00:13:41,601 --> 00:13:43,569
Right now, at that club.

178
00:13:43,636 --> 00:13:46,127
Wait a minute. I forgot
the name of the club.

179
00:13:46,205 --> 00:13:50,005
- Cayuca Club!
- Right. Cayuca!

180
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:51,634
Be right back.

181
00:13:52,512 --> 00:13:53,877
- Dinner time!
- Finally.

182
00:13:53,946 --> 00:13:55,880
You should dance with Bryan, Rache.

183
00:13:55,948 --> 00:13:57,745
- I'm gonna dance with him.
- He's cute!

184
00:13:57,817 --> 00:14:00,980
You'd better be making me
either prime rib or reservations.

185
00:14:03,256 --> 00:14:04,484
There you go.

186
00:14:05,758 --> 00:14:07,453
You're joking, right?

187
00:14:07,527 --> 00:14:10,394
I am ready to dance all night!

188
00:14:10,463 --> 00:14:13,921
There's only one thing this is good for.

189
00:14:14,901 --> 00:14:17,267
- Try this on for size.
- Come on, let's go!

190
00:14:20,106 --> 00:14:21,266
Chloe!

191
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:25,109
That's a bad dog!
That's a very bad dog!

192
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:29,248
Rachel. What did you do to her?

193
00:14:29,315 --> 00:14:32,512
Nothing! She's faking! Let's go.

194
00:14:32,585 --> 00:14:35,053
- You silly girl.
- She's so cute.

195
00:14:35,121 --> 00:14:38,056
- We should take her with us.
- Yes! Take me out for food.

196
00:14:38,124 --> 00:14:40,422
- I'm not taking the dog dancing.
- Cayuca!

197
00:14:40,493 --> 00:14:42,154
Hey! Wait!

198
00:14:45,898 --> 00:14:48,264
Come back here! Oops.

199
00:14:50,303 --> 00:14:52,271
Just add that to the bill.

200
00:14:57,009 --> 00:14:58,271
Hello?

201
00:14:58,344 --> 00:15:00,312
<i>Hola</i> and <i>adiós.</i>

202
00:15:06,886 --> 00:15:10,049
You want to dance, Rachel? Let's dance.

203
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:24,235
OK. Guy with a giant knife. Moving on.

204
00:15:28,874 --> 00:15:32,469
If I wasn't starving,
this might actually be fun.

205
00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:35,474
Oh! There you are.

206
00:15:35,982 --> 00:15:39,383
You are in so much troub...

207
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:42,581
Put me down! Who are you?

208
00:15:48,628 --> 00:15:53,759
Rachel, help me! Somebody, please.
I'm being dognapped!

209
00:15:55,768 --> 00:15:56,757
Rachel!

210
00:16:00,473 --> 00:16:02,805
- So... good night.
- Seriously?

211
00:16:03,743 --> 00:16:04,835
No kiss?

212
00:16:05,578 --> 00:16:06,909
Chloe!

213
00:16:08,414 --> 00:16:09,847
Chloe, come out.

214
00:16:13,119 --> 00:16:15,587
I'm not kidding. I mean it. Stop hiding.

215
00:16:16,322 --> 00:16:20,656
Chloe?
I'm sorry I gave you dog food.

216
00:16:21,894 --> 00:16:22,952
Chloe?

217
00:16:23,029 --> 00:16:26,089
I'll order you room service
for breakfast in the morning!

218
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,333
- Chloe?
- What's up, love bug?

219
00:16:33,306 --> 00:16:34,603
Chloe's missing.

220
00:16:41,213 --> 00:16:44,546
I don't know where she would go.
She doesn't like to walk anywhere,

221
00:16:44,617 --> 00:16:47,643
- let alone run.
- Well...

222
00:16:50,056 --> 00:16:53,150
- What?
- <i>Las peleas de perros</i> were in town.

223
00:16:55,161 --> 00:16:58,688
Dogfights. They're criminals.
Always on the move.

224
00:16:59,832 --> 00:17:01,322
How do I find them?

225
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,924
I have heard rumors.

226
00:17:04,337 --> 00:17:05,804
Mexico City?

227
00:17:07,006 --> 00:17:09,736
Then there's nothing more you can do.

228
00:17:09,809 --> 00:17:12,209
You've done everything you can.

229
00:17:12,278 --> 00:17:14,974
Why don't you go
put your suit on and join us?

230
00:17:15,047 --> 00:17:16,810
I'm going to keep looking for Chloe.

231
00:17:16,882 --> 00:17:19,874
And if I can't find her,
I'm going to Mexico City.

232
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,044
Rache...

233
00:17:23,122 --> 00:17:24,487
Chloe!

234
00:17:43,609 --> 00:17:45,008
Where am I?

235
00:17:45,077 --> 00:17:47,307
You're in the dogfights.

236
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:50,440
Dogfights? What?

237
00:17:50,516 --> 00:17:52,484
This is outrageous.

238
00:17:52,551 --> 00:17:57,545
I was born to shop, not fight.
Unless it's at a sales rack.

239
00:17:57,623 --> 00:18:02,492
- Quit whining, <i>princesa.</i>
- Chloe Winthrop Ashe does not whine.

240
00:18:02,561 --> 00:18:05,189
A delusional Chihuahua.

241
00:18:05,264 --> 00:18:09,792
You won't get any sympathy from Delgado,
<i>señorita.</i> He's a gladiator.

242
00:18:09,869 --> 00:18:11,427
A gladiator?

243
00:18:11,504 --> 00:18:15,372
You know. A fighter.
Delgado is the best of the best.

244
00:18:15,441 --> 00:18:20,140
Don't listen to Rafa, <i>chica.</i>
El Diablo's the meanest dog in the fights.

245
00:18:20,212 --> 00:18:25,081
Word is they fought once before,
and Delgado did not come out on top.

246
00:18:29,922 --> 00:18:31,685
What's he saying?

247
00:18:31,757 --> 00:18:34,590
<i>Ay, bendito,</i> he always
prays before a fight.

248
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,685
Don't you speak any Spanish,
<i>chica?</i>

249
00:18:36,762 --> 00:18:41,699
The name's Chloe, not <i>chica.</i>
And why would I speak Spanish?

250
00:18:41,767 --> 00:18:44,395
- Hello! You're a Chihuahua, <i>mi hija!</i>
- So?

251
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:48,873
I'm from Beverly Hills. You know, 90210,
the shopping capital of the world?

252
00:18:48,941 --> 00:18:51,239
She's a <i>gringa</i> from California.

253
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:54,575
That's right. The only reason
I'm here is because I was stolen.

254
00:18:54,647 --> 00:18:58,014
- You think I volunteered for this?
- But I'm an heiress.

255
00:18:58,083 --> 00:19:01,109
- A hairless?
- No, an heiress.

256
00:19:01,821 --> 00:19:04,289
- I have a trust fund.
- Look.

257
00:19:04,356 --> 00:19:06,916
If you're worth something,
they'll ransom you.

258
00:19:06,992 --> 00:19:09,620
And if they ransom you,
they won't fight you.

259
00:19:10,296 --> 00:19:14,892
- Guess you have nothing to worry about.
- Well, that's a relief.

260
00:19:14,967 --> 00:19:18,368
I am so glad you feel better.
Now can we get a little quiet?

261
00:19:19,638 --> 00:19:22,903
I can't wait until Viv finds out
what Rachel's done.

262
00:19:26,846 --> 00:19:30,612
<i># Mi corazón,</i>
<i>I think of you day and night #

263
00:19:30,683 --> 00:19:32,617
Hold your tacos.

264
00:19:34,587 --> 00:19:36,487
These scents are old.

265
00:19:37,189 --> 00:19:40,386
Papi? Time to go home!

266
00:19:40,459 --> 00:19:42,723
Where is she? Where is my Chloe?

267
00:19:45,931 --> 00:19:46,989
Whoa!

268
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,263
What's going on?

269
00:19:49,935 --> 00:19:51,903
Hey, Papi, come on. Let's go.

270
00:19:53,172 --> 00:19:55,766
- Hi. <i>Hola.</i>
- Hi.

271
00:19:55,841 --> 00:19:59,743
I'm Rachel's friend, and...
you're the gardener, right?

272
00:19:59,812 --> 00:20:03,839
- I'm Sam.
- Your garden is <i>muy bonita.</i>

273
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:07,784
And when I get a <i>casa,</i>
I'm so calling you to be my gardener...

274
00:20:07,853 --> 00:20:09,787
- because it's...
- Thank you very much.

275
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:13,484
- Where's Rachel?
- Forget her, dude. Where's Chloe?

276
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,221
And what are you hiding there?

277
00:20:18,531 --> 00:20:21,091
Chloe's lost in Mexico.
Rachel stayed to find her.

278
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:23,657
The love of my life
is out there in trouble?

279
00:20:23,736 --> 00:20:26,762
She wants me to e-mail
this to her in Mexico City.

280
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:28,272
So...

281
00:20:36,348 --> 00:20:38,316
<i>Señoras y señores!</i>

282
00:20:38,851 --> 00:20:41,718
You know him, you love him.

283
00:20:42,221 --> 00:20:46,453
<i>El campeón, El Diablo!</i>

284
00:20:56,235 --> 00:21:00,467
Oh. It's about time someone's
upgrading my accommodations.

285
00:21:01,874 --> 00:21:03,967
And now, the challenger.

286
00:21:04,043 --> 00:21:07,740
Weighing in at a whopping six pounds.

287
00:21:07,813 --> 00:21:11,510
I give you Chi-Chihuahua!

288
00:21:12,985 --> 00:21:13,974
Hey!

289
00:21:17,022 --> 00:21:18,250
Thank you.

290
00:21:19,091 --> 00:21:22,549
Thank you. You're too kind, really.

291
00:21:23,796 --> 00:21:27,254
This is so much nicer
than that stinky corral.

292
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:31,531
Oh! I'm sorry.
I thought I was alone.

293
00:21:31,604 --> 00:21:35,631
- Mister...
- They call me El Diablo.

294
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:40,270
It's certainly nice to meet you.
Clearly I'm in the wrong place.

295
00:21:40,346 --> 00:21:44,112
So perhaps we could
speak to the concierge or someone.

296
00:21:44,183 --> 00:21:45,172
Stop talking!

297
00:21:45,985 --> 00:21:50,217
You know, I've got a dentist who could
do something about that yellowing.

298
00:21:50,289 --> 00:21:51,950
- What?
- I get the idea that teeth...

299
00:21:52,024 --> 00:21:56,256
- are important in your line of work.
- You don't like my smile?

300
00:21:57,162 --> 00:21:59,790
Watch it! Say it, don't spray it!

301
00:22:01,533 --> 00:22:04,525
- What am I going to do?
- Sounds like he's closing in.

302
00:22:05,537 --> 00:22:07,698
Dog that size?
Won't be much left of her.

303
00:22:07,773 --> 00:22:10,105
<i>Gringa, gringa.</i>

304
00:22:10,175 --> 00:22:11,904
She's <i>adiós.</i> She's bye-bye.

305
00:22:11,977 --> 00:22:13,877
Poor little hairless.

306
00:22:15,948 --> 00:22:17,279
OK, that's it.

307
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:20,618
Delgado? What are you doing?

308
00:22:20,686 --> 00:22:22,847
Huh?

309
00:22:22,921 --> 00:22:25,287
- What's going on?
- Where are you going?

310
00:22:25,357 --> 00:22:28,121
- How do you do that?
- Bro, give me the combination!

311
00:22:28,193 --> 00:22:29,922
- Yeah, save us!
- Save us, Delgado!

312
00:22:29,995 --> 00:22:31,587
- Don't leave us!
- Come back!

313
00:22:31,664 --> 00:22:36,192
This is highly inappropriate.
Hey, hey, hey! That's cashmere!

314
00:22:38,037 --> 00:22:39,026
Ow!

315
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,470
- <i>Vámonos!</i>
- <i>Hasta la</i> bye-bye!

316
00:22:45,978 --> 00:22:49,539
Let go before it... rips.

317
00:22:52,317 --> 00:22:55,753
I know it's rude to leave early,
but I really must be going now.

318
00:22:55,821 --> 00:22:58,119
The show's over for you, <i>chica.</i>

319
00:22:58,724 --> 00:23:02,091
You know, "dog eat dog" is
just an expression!

320
00:23:02,661 --> 00:23:04,959
- Not this time, Diablo!
- Delgado!

321
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:06,691
- Move it!
- OK.

322
00:23:06,765 --> 00:23:09,893
You'll pay for this, Delgado!
I'll find you!

323
00:23:18,677 --> 00:23:21,510
Wait, wait!
Slow down, you guys! Slow down!

324
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:24,071
- What's wrong?
- I told you, it wasn't my fault!

325
00:23:24,149 --> 00:23:26,242
Where'd the dogs go? Go, go!

326
00:23:27,186 --> 00:23:29,017
I want that Chihuahua!

327
00:23:38,697 --> 00:23:41,461
- English, please!
- Move it! Let's go!

328
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,364
- This way! This way!
- OK.

329
00:23:56,148 --> 00:23:58,548
- My bootie!
- Your what?

330
00:23:58,617 --> 00:23:59,982
- My bootie!
- Forget it!

331
00:24:00,052 --> 00:24:01,212
- Forget it?
- Forget it!

332
00:24:01,286 --> 00:24:04,050
- The Chihuahua!
- That's Italian leather, mister!

333
00:24:04,957 --> 00:24:06,288
Look out!

334
00:24:08,727 --> 00:24:10,490
Go! Go!

335
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,161
One at a time!

336
00:24:16,802 --> 00:24:20,203
Hey! Wait a minute!
You won't fit!

337
00:24:20,272 --> 00:24:21,330
I got it!

338
00:24:22,241 --> 00:24:24,607
Oh, no. I lost another bootie.

339
00:24:27,146 --> 00:24:29,512
I am sure I locked those cages, sir.

340
00:24:29,581 --> 00:24:31,981
I want that Chihuahua!

341
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:33,244
Why?

342
00:24:39,792 --> 00:24:41,384
She's worth something.

343
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:45,021
Judging by the diamonds
around her neck, it's a lot.

344
00:24:45,097 --> 00:24:46,086
Look out.

345
00:24:50,169 --> 00:24:52,569
What is all of this?

346
00:24:56,074 --> 00:24:57,405
The Day of the Dead.

347
00:24:57,976 --> 00:25:00,410
This is so beautiful.

348
00:25:01,146 --> 00:25:03,444
It's what humans do
to honor their ancestors.

349
00:25:04,216 --> 00:25:07,310
It keeps them... alive in their hearts.

350
00:25:08,253 --> 00:25:12,121
Helps them remember who they are,
where they came from.

351
00:25:12,191 --> 00:25:13,453
Wow!

352
00:25:13,959 --> 00:25:16,484
- You're my dog!
- Delgado, <i>gracias,</i> bro.

353
00:25:18,397 --> 00:25:21,230
- I'm out of here!
- I'll see ya, kid.

354
00:25:22,134 --> 00:25:25,626
Wait! Wait... Delgado!

355
00:25:29,241 --> 00:25:31,835
"See ya?" That's it?

356
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:35,903
Number one rule of the streets,
<i>princesa.</i> Every dog for himself.

357
00:25:35,981 --> 00:25:38,040
Now, get lost.

358
00:25:38,116 --> 00:25:41,051
My name is not "Princesa." It's Chloe.

359
00:25:42,221 --> 00:25:46,920
And I am lost. And I want to be found.

360
00:25:50,562 --> 00:25:54,089
Look, <i>princesa...</i>
I mean... look, kid.

361
00:25:54,166 --> 00:25:55,895
I got my own problems.

362
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:59,301
I can't go back to the fights.
I got to get out of town.

363
00:25:59,371 --> 00:26:02,238
- How does Beverly Hills sound?
- Too far.

364
00:26:02,307 --> 00:26:05,208
Come on! If you could
figure out a way back,

365
00:26:05,277 --> 00:26:07,541
you could live with us on our estate.

366
00:26:07,613 --> 00:26:10,377
If you haven't noticed,
I'm a little large for a lapdog.

367
00:26:10,449 --> 00:26:13,441
But you're the perfect size
for a guard dog.

368
00:26:13,518 --> 00:26:17,215
Our old one... Papi, he... ran off.

369
00:26:17,289 --> 00:26:19,086
You had a guard dog named Papi?

370
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,019
- What hotel you staying in?
- You'll do it?

371
00:26:24,096 --> 00:26:26,564
Answer the question
before I change my mind!

372
00:26:26,632 --> 00:26:30,466
I don't know the name, but believe me,
it was no Carthay Hotel.

373
00:26:30,535 --> 00:26:34,335
The Carthay? There's one here.
Would they know you?

374
00:26:34,406 --> 00:26:38,809
They should. We're preferred guests.
We have a gold card.

375
00:26:39,511 --> 00:26:42,571
Why me? Of all the dogs in Mexico.

376
00:26:42,648 --> 00:26:45,344
Why me? All I need,
Chihuahua with booties.

377
00:26:45,417 --> 00:26:47,351
This'll be fun! You'll see.

378
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,444
Here's the GPS.

379
00:26:52,925 --> 00:26:53,983
We're hot.

380
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:57,490
Diablo, you go get me that Chihuahua.

381
00:26:58,463 --> 00:26:59,725
Go! Go!

382
00:27:22,054 --> 00:27:24,249
- Hold up a second.
- Uh...

383
00:27:24,756 --> 00:27:26,621
What's that sound?

384
00:27:26,692 --> 00:27:29,490
Hmm. Hold your breath.

385
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:35,661
- What did you do that for?
- El Diablo's got your scent.

386
00:27:35,734 --> 00:27:39,067
Of course he does. It's Chanel No. 5.

387
00:27:39,137 --> 00:27:41,970
- Congratulations.
- Now I've lost another bootie...

388
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,600
- and I stink.
- I don't smell anything.

389
00:27:44,676 --> 00:27:47,474
Are you kidding? I smell like a wet dog.

390
00:27:47,546 --> 00:27:48,808
You are a wet dog.

391
00:27:53,652 --> 00:27:56,917
- Look... <i>señorita...</i>
- Ashe.

392
00:27:56,989 --> 00:27:59,514
Ashe. I'm sorry.

393
00:28:00,325 --> 00:28:02,987
We're already trying to stop the fights.

394
00:28:04,129 --> 00:28:08,964
And we don't have time to look
for every lost dog in Mexico.

395
00:28:09,034 --> 00:28:11,002
This is not just any dog.

396
00:28:11,069 --> 00:28:14,197
This is my Aunt Viv's dog.
Chloe means everything to her.

397
00:28:16,074 --> 00:28:17,564
I'll tell you what.

398
00:28:18,176 --> 00:28:22,840
Go back to your hotel, download
that photo you were telling me about

399
00:28:23,682 --> 00:28:26,674
and I will see what I can do.

400
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:29,380
- <i>Gracias.</i>
- You're welcome!

401
00:28:34,526 --> 00:28:37,188
- Hi, Aunt Viv.
- Ciao, Rachel.

402
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:40,225
Yes, Capri's fantastic.

403
00:28:40,298 --> 00:28:44,394
I was trying the house earlier.
I was worried because nobody was there.

404
00:28:44,469 --> 00:28:47,404
Yeah, we went out for Mexican.

405
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,471
Could I talk to her just a second?

406
00:28:50,542 --> 00:28:52,772
Um... I'll put her on.

407
00:28:56,715 --> 00:29:00,344
Hi, baby! How's my little baby?

408
00:29:04,256 --> 00:29:06,349
I miss you, too! I miss you, too!

409
00:29:17,903 --> 00:29:22,772
OK, here you are,
Your Highness. Carthay Hotel.

410
00:29:22,841 --> 00:29:26,277
I feel like I'm home already!

411
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:32,111
- Thank you, Delgado. Thank you!
- All in a day's work.

412
00:29:32,651 --> 00:29:37,088
But... maybe you should wait out here.

413
00:29:37,155 --> 00:29:39,783
- Yeah, whatever.
- I don't mean it like it sounds,

414
00:29:39,858 --> 00:29:44,192
but they can be a little particular
about the dogs they let in.

415
00:29:45,597 --> 00:29:46,894
Knock yourself out.

416
00:29:47,532 --> 00:29:50,160
We'll be eating gourmet food in no time.

417
00:29:50,669 --> 00:29:53,399
- <i>Bienvenidos al</i> Hotel Carthay.
- Thank you.

418
00:29:59,778 --> 00:30:03,373
Excuse me. Would you be so kind
as to look at my collar?

419
00:30:03,448 --> 00:30:05,541
You'll find my owner's
name and number.

420
00:30:08,787 --> 00:30:10,755
Tshh! Get out!

421
00:30:11,189 --> 00:30:13,749
Hello! Ew!

422
00:30:14,459 --> 00:30:15,858
It touched me!

423
00:30:15,927 --> 00:30:17,827
Get this mutt out of here.

424
00:30:18,697 --> 00:30:21,097
- Mutt? How dare you!
- Edgar!

425
00:30:21,166 --> 00:30:24,158
I've been a preferred customer
at this hotel for years!

426
00:30:24,236 --> 00:30:26,261
Don't you dare!

427
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:32,900
- I'm sorry.
- You are making a big mistake. Huge.

428
00:30:33,612 --> 00:30:37,275
Really!

429
00:30:38,116 --> 00:30:39,845
Oh, no.

430
00:30:39,918 --> 00:30:41,146
I'm...

431
00:30:41,219 --> 00:30:44,120
I'm... hideous.

432
00:30:46,491 --> 00:30:48,152
What's taking her so long?

433
00:31:10,248 --> 00:31:12,239
Hmm. Figures.

434
00:31:14,586 --> 00:31:17,953
What did I expect...
<i>de una princesa?</i>

435
00:31:27,666 --> 00:31:32,603
Delgado, it was so humiliating.
You won't believe...

436
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:36,500
Delgado?

437
00:31:42,147 --> 00:31:44,138
Delgado.

438
00:32:55,487 --> 00:32:58,217
Excuse me. I'm here to see
Detective Ramirez.

439
00:33:01,159 --> 00:33:05,357
Detective Ramirez is already with someone,
<i>señorita.</i> Five minutes, please.

440
00:33:16,141 --> 00:33:19,110
Psst. Don't look now,
Hannah Montana, three o'clock.

441
00:33:21,246 --> 00:33:25,876
What are you doing here?
I mean, <i>qué</i> are you doing here?

442
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:28,680
Isn't it obvious? To find Chloe.

443
00:33:28,753 --> 00:33:30,243
Angela told me everything.

444
00:33:30,322 --> 00:33:32,722
Why did you pretend
you couldn't speak English?

445
00:33:32,791 --> 00:33:34,952
I didn't. You just assumed.

446
00:33:35,026 --> 00:33:37,927
Thought you'd let me go along
and make a fool of myself?

447
00:33:37,996 --> 00:33:39,793
Didn't need any help with that.

448
00:33:39,864 --> 00:33:42,298
What makes you think
I need help from a gardener?

449
00:33:43,335 --> 00:33:45,064
Oh, no, she didn't.

450
00:33:45,136 --> 00:33:48,469
It's not that I have a
problem with that word, but,

451
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:50,303
actually, I am a landscaper.

452
00:33:50,375 --> 00:33:52,741
And I'm not here for you.

453
00:33:52,811 --> 00:33:56,269
I'm here for Vivian,
because she's like family to me.

454
00:34:01,219 --> 00:34:06,452
I e-mailed a description
of the dog's collar to all our stations.

455
00:34:06,524 --> 00:34:08,651
Chloe's collar. It's worth a fortune.

456
00:34:08,727 --> 00:34:09,853
You're welcome.

457
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:14,961
Maybe a picture of the collar
might be even more helpful.

458
00:34:15,033 --> 00:34:16,466
Yeah, a lot. <i>Gracias.</i>

459
00:34:17,302 --> 00:34:19,770
So what should we do now?

460
00:34:19,838 --> 00:34:21,328
We? Nothing.

461
00:34:21,406 --> 00:34:24,807
You go back to
your hotel and wait. Please.

462
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:30,172
He's right. There's nothing you can do.

463
00:34:30,248 --> 00:34:33,274
What? We're Mexi-can, not Mexi-can't!

464
00:34:33,351 --> 00:34:36,548
I'm not going to stop looking.
He only cares about the collar.

465
00:34:36,621 --> 00:34:37,610
I need the dog.

466
00:34:38,857 --> 00:34:41,655
I'm with her, <i>amigo.</i>
My Chloe's in trouble.

467
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,050
Hey! Papi! Hey!

468
00:34:44,129 --> 00:34:47,121
- Come on, fool. Let's go!
- Papi, where're you going?

469
00:35:00,412 --> 00:35:02,710
I cannot believe Chloe's missing this.

470
00:35:02,781 --> 00:35:05,875
Sebastian! Thank you.

471
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:08,418
Going to be on the cover
of <i>Purebred Monthly.</i>

472
00:35:08,486 --> 00:35:10,386
- Oh.
- Whoo hoo!

473
00:35:10,455 --> 00:35:13,185
This party is off the leash!

474
00:35:13,258 --> 00:35:15,590
Whoa! Party!

475
00:35:16,961 --> 00:35:18,690
So Scooter.

476
00:35:18,763 --> 00:35:20,958
- Come here, Birthday Dog.
- No, Whiskey.

477
00:35:21,032 --> 00:35:23,500
No, that really isn't necessary.

478
00:35:23,568 --> 00:35:26,093
OK. Thank you, thank you.

479
00:35:26,171 --> 00:35:27,570
Ooh.

480
00:35:27,639 --> 00:35:30,540
Hey, you guys don't think
Chloe's in trouble, do you?

481
00:35:30,608 --> 00:35:34,669
Paa-lease. I bet Rachel whisked her
off to some faboo place.

482
00:35:34,746 --> 00:35:36,338
If I know Chloe...

483
00:35:36,414 --> 00:35:40,407
she's sitting under a palm tree
being waited on by some hunky husky.

484
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:50,652
Oh! Thank you!

485
00:35:51,162 --> 00:35:53,630
I must be starving.

486
00:35:53,698 --> 00:35:57,828
- Yeah. That's our churro.
- <i>Sí,</i> our churro.

487
00:35:57,902 --> 00:36:00,598
Excuse me, but... I saw it first!

488
00:36:00,672 --> 00:36:04,199
Better back off, <i>muchachos.</i>

489
00:36:04,275 --> 00:36:07,108
Looks like we have
one of those Chihuahua warriors!

490
00:36:07,178 --> 00:36:11,979
Now look, I've been dognapped,
lost my favorite cashmere sweater...

491
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:16,111
slept in a box and I'm starting another
in a series of bad hair days.

492
00:36:16,187 --> 00:36:18,655
So don't... push me!

493
00:36:18,723 --> 00:36:22,318
- Let's get out of here, man.
- Sorry... sorry.

494
00:36:22,393 --> 00:36:25,794
That's what I thought. Ha!

495
00:36:25,864 --> 00:36:29,493
It's time to pay the piper,
<i>perra pequeña.</i>

496
00:36:29,567 --> 00:36:31,558
- Where were we?
- Hang on, kid!

497
00:36:33,438 --> 00:36:38,341
Still trying to be the hero!
I'll smell you out, Delgado.

498
00:36:42,614 --> 00:36:45,913
The Aztec Empire's heart
was right here in Chapultepec Park.

499
00:36:45,984 --> 00:36:48,350
Once used by the kings
as a royal retreat.

500
00:37:01,833 --> 00:37:03,562
- Move it! Hurry up!
- I am!

501
00:37:03,635 --> 00:37:06,604
- Come on! Two at a time!
- I have four-inch legs.

502
00:37:06,671 --> 00:37:09,936
Come on. This way.

503
00:37:10,008 --> 00:37:12,135
Not this way.

504
00:37:15,013 --> 00:37:17,880
- Where to now?
- Now we're trapped.

505
00:37:18,182 --> 00:37:20,582
- Now what?
- I'm thinking, I'm thinking.

506
00:37:32,463 --> 00:37:34,363
Why did you abandon me?

507
00:37:35,166 --> 00:37:37,361
I've already been abandoned once.

508
00:37:38,469 --> 00:37:40,630
You left me, I didn't leave you!

509
00:37:40,705 --> 00:37:43,503
I saw you in there
getting pampered, and eating...

510
00:37:43,575 --> 00:37:46,009
The closest I came to food
was a used churro.

511
00:37:54,218 --> 00:37:55,742
Come on, let's go.

512
00:37:58,156 --> 00:38:01,216
- Where are we going?
- I'm taking you to Puerto Vallarta.

513
00:38:01,292 --> 00:38:04,455
- Somebody there can help us.
- That on the way to Beverly Hills?

514
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,399
Over here. Jump in.

515
00:38:14,205 --> 00:38:16,002
- Delgado?
- What?

516
00:38:16,074 --> 00:38:18,736
Why is El Diablo after me?

517
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:20,971
Vasquez must have sent him.

518
00:38:21,045 --> 00:38:23,240
Who's Vasquez?

519
00:38:23,314 --> 00:38:26,772
He runs the dog fights and anything
else he can make a quick buck at.

520
00:38:26,851 --> 00:38:30,048
The police have been after him
for years, but he's slippery.

521
00:38:30,121 --> 00:38:32,351
How do you know all that?

522
00:38:33,658 --> 00:38:35,319
Were you a criminal or something?

523
00:38:36,127 --> 00:38:39,119
Or something. Get some sleep.

524
00:38:39,697 --> 00:38:41,790
It's a long ride
and tomorrow's a big day.

525
00:38:41,866 --> 00:38:45,427
What did El Diablo mean by,
"Still trying to be the hero?"

526
00:38:50,675 --> 00:38:51,699
Never mind.

527
00:38:59,717 --> 00:39:04,518
What the...
What's this? That's Chloe's bootie!

528
00:39:05,323 --> 00:39:06,654
Hey, lady!

529
00:39:10,528 --> 00:39:13,895
What? What is it?
Chloe's bootie. Good job.

530
00:39:13,965 --> 00:39:16,798
She is near. I can feel it.

531
00:39:17,935 --> 00:39:19,163
Hey, wait for me!

532
00:39:22,106 --> 00:39:23,130
He said...

533
00:39:23,207 --> 00:39:27,268
he saw a white Chihuahua
with a bunch of dogs run through here.

534
00:39:28,046 --> 00:39:30,446
She was being carried
by a German Shepherd...

535
00:39:30,515 --> 00:39:33,678
- German Shepherd carried my Chloe?
- Let's go!

536
00:39:33,751 --> 00:39:36,652
I'm going to kick some tail. Papi style!

537
00:39:36,854 --> 00:39:39,322
Yes?

538
00:39:39,457 --> 00:39:41,948
<i>Someone else</i>
<i>is looking for that dog.</i>

539
00:39:43,561 --> 00:39:47,327
There is a lot of money riding on
this Chihuahua, do you understand?

540
00:39:47,398 --> 00:39:49,593
They cannot find her before we do.

541
00:39:49,667 --> 00:39:51,362
- <i>I'm on it.</i>
- Good.

542
00:39:56,908 --> 00:39:58,466
Come on, baby.

543
00:39:59,477 --> 00:40:01,035
Come on, Diablo.

544
00:40:16,728 --> 00:40:19,925
OK, this is us. We're here.
Shake your last bootie and let's go.

545
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:28,971
- What's your plan?
- OK, here's the deal.

546
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:33,204
Plant your paws here, keep your muzzle
shut, and wait for me to come back.

547
00:40:33,277 --> 00:40:37,008
But... where are you going?
Delgado?

548
00:40:37,882 --> 00:40:40,612
You're very withholding, you know that?

549
00:40:44,388 --> 00:40:46,822
I guess this is my day at the spa.

550
00:40:59,604 --> 00:41:01,162
Ahh.

551
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,071
Much better.

552
00:41:07,478 --> 00:41:10,072
There she is.
Now, you remember the con, right?

553
00:41:10,148 --> 00:41:12,048
I don't really have to eat you, do I?

554
00:41:12,116 --> 00:41:16,780
Only swallow my legs.
OK, here we go. Easy on the teeth.

555
00:41:17,922 --> 00:41:19,913
- Act scary.
- OK.

556
00:41:19,991 --> 00:41:23,222
Help! Help, please help me!

557
00:41:23,294 --> 00:41:27,458
- Help me, somebody! Help!
- You're choking me.

558
00:41:27,532 --> 00:41:29,523
Keep your tongue to yourself.

559
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,500
Help me! Somebody, please!

560
00:41:31,569 --> 00:41:34,629
This is just like <i>Animal Planet.</i>
What do I do?

561
00:41:34,705 --> 00:41:37,538
Something! Anything! Help!

562
00:41:37,608 --> 00:41:41,271
Shoo, lizard. Shoo, shoo.
Regurgitate that rat!

563
00:41:42,413 --> 00:41:43,744
Ew.

564
00:41:45,116 --> 00:41:48,142
Oh, my gosh. Are you all right? Hello?

565
00:41:52,723 --> 00:41:56,250
Are you an angel? Am I dead?

566
00:41:56,327 --> 00:41:58,955
No. And I'm not an angel.

567
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:02,056
And yet you're wearing a halo.

568
00:42:02,133 --> 00:42:06,001
This? This is my collar
from Harry Winston.

569
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:08,334
- Is that in heaven?
- Well...

570
00:42:08,406 --> 00:42:10,966
Sort of. Beverly Hills.

571
00:42:11,042 --> 00:42:12,509
Ahh.

572
00:42:12,577 --> 00:42:16,069
Beverly Hills.
You're a long way from home.

573
00:42:16,147 --> 00:42:20,641
Perhaps I can be of assistance.
I am Manuel.

574
00:42:20,718 --> 00:42:22,948
I work on a luxury cruise ship
as a porter...

575
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:28,014
tending to the discriminating needs
of refined, upscale dogs like yourself.

576
00:42:28,092 --> 00:42:31,289
Really? Do you think you
could help me get home?

577
00:42:31,362 --> 00:42:36,766
Well, you saved my life.
It's the very least I can do.

578
00:42:57,755 --> 00:43:01,156
Delgado?

579
00:43:01,225 --> 00:43:02,522
Delgado?

580
00:43:02,593 --> 00:43:05,323
- Hey, Tomas.
- It's really you, cuz?

581
00:43:05,396 --> 00:43:08,388
What happened? Where you been?
Nobody's seen you since...

582
00:43:08,466 --> 00:43:10,127
You know, a while.

583
00:43:10,835 --> 00:43:13,827
Look... I'm doing this
little security gig.

584
00:43:13,905 --> 00:43:16,874
I'm taking a rich Chihuahua
back to Beverly Hills.

585
00:43:16,941 --> 00:43:18,636
She's got a tag
on her collar.

586
00:43:18,709 --> 00:43:20,506
So take her to a rescue shelter.

587
00:43:20,578 --> 00:43:23,342
- They'll read it and call the owner.
- Not that simple.

588
00:43:23,414 --> 00:43:26,747
Vasquez is looking for her,
he's got informants everywhere.

589
00:43:27,885 --> 00:43:30,012
He's even got El Diablo after her.

590
00:43:30,087 --> 00:43:33,147
El Diablo. That's why you're doing it?

591
00:43:33,224 --> 00:43:35,158
That <i>delincuente</i> is behind me.

592
00:43:35,226 --> 00:43:38,457
It's just a job. Can you get
Officer Mendez to call her tag?

593
00:43:38,529 --> 00:43:40,497
Yeah, OK. Bring it to me.

594
00:43:40,564 --> 00:43:42,361
- I'll see what I can do.
- <i>Gracias.</i>

595
00:43:46,671 --> 00:43:49,834
Come on, let's go.
I found someone to read your tag.

596
00:43:49,907 --> 00:43:53,172
- Really? So did I.
- Where's your collar?

597
00:43:53,244 --> 00:43:55,872
You're not the only one
who can get things done.

598
00:43:55,947 --> 00:43:58,177
- What?
- I gave my collar to Manuel...

599
00:43:58,249 --> 00:44:00,740
He is taking it to
the ship's captain to read.

600
00:44:00,818 --> 00:44:02,786
Manuel? Who's Manuel?

601
00:44:02,853 --> 00:44:05,321
The kindly pack rat
who's helping me out.

602
00:44:05,389 --> 00:44:08,119
I saved him from
being eaten by an iguana.

603
00:44:08,192 --> 00:44:10,752
An iguana? An iguana!

604
00:44:10,828 --> 00:44:14,264
That is the oldest con in the book!
Iguanas are vegetarians!

605
00:44:14,332 --> 00:44:18,359
I'm sorry. I don't meet
many iguanas on Rodeo Drive.

606
00:44:18,436 --> 00:44:20,267
Without your ID tag...

607
00:44:20,338 --> 00:44:24,297
there's nothing to separate you
from any collarless stray on the street!

608
00:44:24,375 --> 00:44:25,899
But... Well...

609
00:44:25,977 --> 00:44:29,276
Manuel promised me
he'd be right back from the ship.

610
00:44:29,347 --> 00:44:31,474
What ship? That ship?

611
00:44:31,549 --> 00:44:34,643
What happened to the
"don't talk to strangers"?

612
00:44:34,719 --> 00:44:36,687
You said nothing about iguanas.

613
00:44:43,961 --> 00:44:48,762
then I said, "Are you an
angel?" American dogs are so gullible.

614
00:44:48,833 --> 00:44:52,200
Chico, who is the
greatest con man in Mexico?

615
00:44:52,269 --> 00:44:55,830
You are. And now,
can we steal some lunch? I'm hungry.

616
00:44:55,906 --> 00:44:58,500
- Where did you get that?
- Please don't eat me, man!

617
00:44:58,576 --> 00:45:00,669
I got a wife and 300 kids to feed.

618
00:45:00,745 --> 00:45:03,509
- Eat him first!
- Where is the Chihuahua?

619
00:45:03,581 --> 00:45:07,642
Chihuahua? I don't know any Chihuahua.
I'm from the Yucatán.

620
00:45:07,718 --> 00:45:11,677
Of course if you'd like to meet one,
I could arrange it for the right price.

621
00:45:11,756 --> 00:45:13,917
You're about to be lunch.

622
00:45:13,991 --> 00:45:16,892
That's the right price.
How'd you know?

623
00:45:16,961 --> 00:45:18,155
Do something, Manuel.

624
00:45:18,229 --> 00:45:21,494
You're trying my patience,
<i>chaparrito.</i>

625
00:45:21,565 --> 00:45:23,226
Stop trying his patience.

626
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:25,700
- Where is she?
- By the fountain, near the docks.

627
00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:30,764
I didn't know she was a friend of yours.
I was just borrowing it.

628
00:45:30,841 --> 00:45:32,331
Please don't hurt me.

629
00:45:34,111 --> 00:45:35,703
Hmm. Hmm.

630
00:45:35,813 --> 00:45:39,112
Ha! That's dog's lucky
I didn't cha-cha on his chest.

631
00:45:39,183 --> 00:45:42,584
You know, Manuel, I don't think
that dog was a friend of hers.

632
00:45:42,653 --> 00:45:44,848
It's not our problem, Chico.

633
00:45:44,922 --> 00:45:48,358
Come on, let's go raid a piñata.
I feel like feeding my sweet tooth.

634
00:45:48,426 --> 00:45:53,295
Leave me out of this, Manuel.
Where there's a piñata, there's a stick.

635
00:45:56,767 --> 00:45:59,395
- Uh, Delgado?
- Yeah?

636
00:45:59,470 --> 00:46:01,461
What are we doing here?

637
00:46:01,539 --> 00:46:05,100
- This is where we meet the coyote.
- A coyote?

638
00:46:05,176 --> 00:46:09,237
A smuggler. They sneak collarless dogs
like us across the border.

639
00:46:12,683 --> 00:46:16,141
You used to be a police dog, didn't you?

640
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:20,987
That's how you know Sergeant Tomas.
That's how you can do all those things.

641
00:46:21,058 --> 00:46:24,391
- I don't want to talk about it.
- Did you quit? Did you get fired?

642
00:46:24,462 --> 00:46:26,259
Did you do something wrong?

643
00:46:26,330 --> 00:46:29,925
Yes, I did something wrong, OK?
You satisfied?

644
00:46:30,734 --> 00:46:31,826
Now, just drop it.

645
00:46:32,603 --> 00:46:34,298
OK. OK.

646
00:46:35,773 --> 00:46:39,106
There he is. We're on. Follow me.

647
00:46:39,844 --> 00:46:42,745
- And no more questions.
- OK. OK.

648
00:46:44,782 --> 00:46:48,445
- But what was it? Was someone hurt?
- Drop it! Just drop it!

649
00:46:49,587 --> 00:46:51,077
You're driving me crazy.

650
00:46:51,155 --> 00:46:55,091
You're not exactly the most charming
traveling companion either.

651
00:46:55,159 --> 00:46:57,593
- Good, because we're parting ways.
- What?

652
00:46:58,662 --> 00:47:01,529
Wait, wait! What are you doing?

653
00:47:02,266 --> 00:47:04,257
This train will take you to Tijuana.

654
00:47:04,335 --> 00:47:05,461
- But...
- But nothing.

655
00:47:05,536 --> 00:47:07,470
The coyote will take you
over the border.

656
00:47:07,671 --> 00:47:09,901
- <i>Buenos Días.</i>
- <i>Wha...</i>

657
00:47:09,974 --> 00:47:12,966
Make yourself at home.

658
00:47:13,677 --> 00:47:15,201
Best of luck.

659
00:47:15,713 --> 00:47:18,739
But... you promised.

660
00:47:24,421 --> 00:47:26,321
Delgado...

661
00:47:45,276 --> 00:47:48,439
Don't turn around. Don't turn around.

662
00:47:48,512 --> 00:47:50,377
Don't... What am I doing?

663
00:47:56,687 --> 00:47:59,349
- Delgado!
- Chloe!

664
00:48:01,725 --> 00:48:04,717
- Delgado!
- Chloe!

665
00:48:06,197 --> 00:48:07,926
Come on. Jump!

666
00:48:07,998 --> 00:48:10,262
It's a fast train!

667
00:48:10,334 --> 00:48:13,167
You can do it! Jump!

668
00:48:14,572 --> 00:48:16,472
That hurt.

669
00:48:16,607 --> 00:48:18,234
OK, good.

670
00:48:18,676 --> 00:48:21,770
- I could use a little help.
- I'll pull you up.

671
00:48:25,683 --> 00:48:29,346
Don't help. Don't help.

672
00:48:36,026 --> 00:48:39,154
What can I say? A promise is a promise.

673
00:48:39,230 --> 00:48:41,221
Sure thing, Delgado.

674
00:48:44,368 --> 00:48:47,496
Sam! How do you say
"lost" in Spanish?

675
00:48:57,548 --> 00:48:59,140
Chloe.

676
00:48:59,850 --> 00:49:01,249
Wait, he's got something.

677
00:49:03,854 --> 00:49:06,345
Papi! Papi!

678
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:12,655
You! That scent.
Where did you get that scent?

679
00:49:12,730 --> 00:49:14,322
Maybe you haven't noticed,

680
00:49:14,398 --> 00:49:16,764
but I'm currently napping
in a sewage pipe.

681
00:49:16,834 --> 00:49:19,564
You mean the moldy taco?

682
00:49:19,637 --> 00:49:23,004
No, fool. The perfume. It's Chloe's.

683
00:49:23,073 --> 00:49:25,598
She's an American Chihuahua.

684
00:49:25,676 --> 00:49:28,338
Her ears are as pink as seashells...

685
00:49:28,412 --> 00:49:32,212
and her nose is like a raspberry.

686
00:49:32,283 --> 00:49:35,013
- You serious, bro?
- Eh? A berry?

687
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:41,748
Is she kind of uppity?
Wears matching clothes?

688
00:49:41,825 --> 00:49:44,817
- You know her? Where is she?
- Last we saw her...

689
00:49:44,895 --> 00:49:47,557
- she was with Delgado on the run.
- Yeah.

690
00:49:47,631 --> 00:49:50,794
- Mm-hm.
- Delgado? Who is this Delgado?

691
00:49:52,269 --> 00:49:54,464
I want to hear more. Come with me.

692
00:49:56,774 --> 00:49:59,038
Looks like he found a couple of friends.

693
00:49:59,109 --> 00:50:01,839
Just what we need, stray dogs.

694
00:50:03,147 --> 00:50:07,584
Papi was a stray dog.
I saved him from the pound.

695
00:50:08,786 --> 00:50:09,844
Hey, buddy.

696
00:50:11,622 --> 00:50:15,718
He inspires me every day.
What inspires you, Rachel?

697
00:50:17,695 --> 00:50:19,390
Get back to you on that.

698
00:50:19,463 --> 00:50:21,431
Hey.

699
00:50:21,498 --> 00:50:25,958
Look at that. How you doing? Hello.

700
00:50:26,904 --> 00:50:29,930
I guess he is kind of cute.
We could take them with us,

701
00:50:30,007 --> 00:50:32,305
but you have to give them a bath,
they stink.

702
00:50:32,376 --> 00:50:33,775
I can handle that.

703
00:50:33,844 --> 00:50:36,506
- You stink! Oh!
- You just need a bath.

704
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:39,811
Oh, I love this!

705
00:50:39,883 --> 00:50:42,977
I think I'm in love
with the <i>gringa.</i>

706
00:50:46,357 --> 00:50:49,656
- I think he likes it.
- I think he likes you.

707
00:50:52,296 --> 00:50:53,729
Where you going? Wait for me!

708
00:51:06,009 --> 00:51:09,137
Oh, yeah. <i>Mira,</i> I'm clean.
I'm clean. I never knew clean.

709
00:51:09,213 --> 00:51:10,578
I know clean now.

710
00:51:10,647 --> 00:51:13,582
I have never had
my teeth brushed before.

711
00:51:13,650 --> 00:51:15,584
It's... minty.

712
00:51:15,652 --> 00:51:17,449
It's weird.

713
00:51:17,521 --> 00:51:19,318
Papi, this is great!

714
00:51:19,390 --> 00:51:22,018
- We should call room service.
- Let's order a movie.

715
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:24,989
Have we found a home, Papi?

716
00:51:25,062 --> 00:51:28,998
I don't know, but they'll make sure
you're safe.

717
00:51:29,066 --> 00:51:31,728
Sam did it for me.

718
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:34,728
See you tomorrow.

719
00:51:34,805 --> 00:51:36,898
- Come on.
- No, they can stay with me.

720
00:51:38,108 --> 00:51:39,302
I take responsibility.

721
00:51:40,144 --> 00:51:41,372
Cool.

722
00:51:41,445 --> 00:51:43,242
Papi, what do you see, <i>compa?</i>

723
00:51:43,313 --> 00:51:45,247
It's a big place, my little friend.

724
00:51:45,983 --> 00:51:49,885
I may be small, but I am fighting...

725
00:51:49,953 --> 00:51:52,615
for something... bigger than all of it.

726
00:51:54,291 --> 00:51:56,350
<i>Mi Corazón.</i>

727
00:52:18,982 --> 00:52:21,610
Excuse me. Where are you from?

728
00:52:21,685 --> 00:52:25,451
- I'm from Beverly Hills.
- Where is that?

729
00:52:25,522 --> 00:52:30,289
Well... it feels like
a long way from here.

730
00:52:31,328 --> 00:52:34,263
<i>Señorita,</i> what is that?

731
00:52:34,331 --> 00:52:37,095
It's a bootie. I lost the others.

732
00:52:37,167 --> 00:52:40,261
All the dogs in Beverly Hills
wear them to protect their feet.

733
00:52:40,337 --> 00:52:42,567
It must be very dirty there.

734
00:52:42,639 --> 00:52:47,133
No. Actually, it's probably
the cleanest place I know.

735
00:52:47,978 --> 00:52:50,742
Then that's pretty silly
to wear a bootie.

736
00:52:50,814 --> 00:52:52,281
Pedro, be polite.

737
00:52:53,851 --> 00:52:55,443
You know something, Pedro?

738
00:52:58,155 --> 00:52:59,213
You're right.

739
00:53:34,258 --> 00:53:36,249
Rachel.

740
00:53:37,494 --> 00:53:38,483
Rachel.

741
00:53:38,562 --> 00:53:41,030
Come on, Sleeping Beauty, let's go.

742
00:53:41,098 --> 00:53:42,793
Detective Ramirez called.

743
00:53:42,866 --> 00:53:46,165
A white Chihuahua and a German
Shepherd were seen in Puerto Vallarta.

744
00:53:46,236 --> 00:53:49,330
They're not sure if it was her,
she wasn't wearing her collar.

745
00:53:49,406 --> 00:53:51,704
What? Someone stole Chloe's collar?

746
00:53:51,775 --> 00:53:54,710
I'm going to go
all kinds of Mexican on him.

747
00:53:58,081 --> 00:54:00,606
Chico, I have this pain
in the pit of my stomach.

748
00:54:00,684 --> 00:54:04,484
- Must have been the Pop Rocks.
- Or it could be... guilt.

749
00:54:04,555 --> 00:54:07,183
We should have never
stolen that <i>chica's</i> collar.

750
00:54:07,257 --> 00:54:08,747
Now she'll never get home.

751
00:54:15,265 --> 00:54:16,755
Let's get out of here!

752
00:54:35,352 --> 00:54:37,217
Make a left, make a left.

753
00:54:37,287 --> 00:54:39,312
Aisle four, tortillas on the floor.

754
00:54:40,857 --> 00:54:44,088
- I feel naked.
- Every man for himself!

755
00:54:47,164 --> 00:54:49,325
- My head!
- Go through his legs!

756
00:54:49,399 --> 00:54:50,798
This way. Come on!

757
00:54:50,867 --> 00:54:52,061
Back the other way!

758
00:54:55,539 --> 00:54:56,801
Get off me!

759
00:54:59,910 --> 00:55:02,208
Hey, Chico! We're home free!

760
00:55:06,550 --> 00:55:08,017
Back up, back up!

761
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:11,987
That's what you get!

762
00:55:20,430 --> 00:55:22,295
Hey! He's got my diamonds!

763
00:55:22,366 --> 00:55:24,095
- Our diamonds.
- Whatever.

764
00:55:39,883 --> 00:55:43,250
Wake up! The conductor's coming!
Hide! <i>Rápido,</i> hide!

765
00:55:48,158 --> 00:55:49,489
What's going on?

766
00:55:49,559 --> 00:55:52,289
- Delgado, what's happening?
- We got trouble.

767
00:55:53,230 --> 00:55:55,289
Hide behind the crate.
I'll distract him.

768
00:55:55,365 --> 00:55:57,390
Don't come out,
no matter what happens.

769
00:55:57,467 --> 00:55:58,559
But, Delgado...

770
00:55:58,635 --> 00:56:00,603
Don't come out,
no matter what happens.

771
00:56:00,671 --> 00:56:02,866
- What are you gonna do?
- Something crazy.

772
00:56:26,496 --> 00:56:28,396
Well, that used to be easier.

773
00:56:33,103 --> 00:56:34,400
Just my luck.

774
00:56:34,471 --> 00:56:36,735
Delgado!

775
00:56:37,441 --> 00:56:39,409
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, my back.

776
00:56:39,476 --> 00:56:41,376
- Did you see that?
- Yes.

777
00:56:41,445 --> 00:56:46,542
I just jumped off a train!
By myself! And it was moving.

778
00:56:47,417 --> 00:56:49,851
I told you to stay onboard.

779
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:53,447
But we're in this together.
I couldn't leave you here.

780
00:56:55,225 --> 00:56:57,455
I've never had a friend like you.

781
00:56:58,495 --> 00:57:01,521
You should have stayed, kid.
Look around.

782
00:57:02,566 --> 00:57:04,033
You should have stayed.

783
00:57:08,271 --> 00:57:11,069
I told the local police
I found the collar on a rat.

784
00:57:11,141 --> 00:57:13,166
But they didn't believe me.

785
00:57:13,243 --> 00:57:16,371
I went to turn the diamonds in,
and they tried to arrest me.

786
00:57:16,446 --> 00:57:18,937
Sorry for the confusion, <i>señor.</i>

787
00:57:19,015 --> 00:57:21,381
The rat, he's clever.

788
00:57:21,451 --> 00:57:23,351
<i>Oye,</i> this <i>hombre</i>
needs help.

789
00:57:23,420 --> 00:57:26,514
I set traps to keep him out,
but he always gets in!

790
00:57:27,257 --> 00:57:28,986
Sneaky, sneaky mouse.

791
00:57:29,059 --> 00:57:30,321
You know what you need?

792
00:57:30,393 --> 00:57:33,157
A guard dog.

793
00:57:33,230 --> 00:57:36,028
- He's a stray.
- Yeah, he's a stray...

794
00:57:36,099 --> 00:57:38,226
but he's a really good dog.

795
00:57:45,909 --> 00:57:48,002
Thanks for
returning Chloe's collar.

796
00:57:48,078 --> 00:57:51,047
Congratulations, <i>amigo.</i>
You have a home.

797
00:57:51,114 --> 00:57:54,106
<i>Gracias,</i> Rafa.
It will happen for you, too.

798
00:57:54,184 --> 00:57:55,776
Stay brown, brother.

799
00:57:55,852 --> 00:57:58,082
Come on.
Ain't nothing to it but to do it.

800
00:57:58,155 --> 00:58:00,487
- <i>Adiós</i>
- <i>Adiós,</i> Chucho.

801
00:58:00,557 --> 00:58:02,149
Hey, don't chew the furniture.

802
00:58:02,225 --> 00:58:04,250
- Good luck finding your dog.
- Thank you.

803
00:58:06,029 --> 00:58:08,395
I just got off
with the Puerto Vallarta police.

804
00:58:08,465 --> 00:58:12,299
There was some dog trouble
on the northbound train this morning.

805
00:58:12,369 --> 00:58:14,166
A German Shepherd jumped off.

806
00:58:15,405 --> 00:58:16,463
Chloe.

807
00:58:17,340 --> 00:58:19,865
- Thank you.
- Call me if you find out anything.

808
00:58:19,943 --> 00:58:23,470
- Follow the tracks north.
- Through the Sonoran Desert.

809
00:58:23,547 --> 00:58:25,139
This will be great.

810
00:58:25,215 --> 00:58:27,240
She's getting away with my diamonds.

811
00:58:27,317 --> 00:58:30,514
I think that that's like...
karma, man.

812
00:58:30,587 --> 00:58:34,580
See, you steal it,
and eventually it is stolen from you.

813
00:58:34,658 --> 00:58:36,216
And I steal it back.

814
00:58:37,093 --> 00:58:39,061
- How you going to do that?
- Quiet!

815
00:58:57,814 --> 00:59:01,045
So, Bimini says that
she's going out with Scooter...

816
00:59:01,117 --> 00:59:03,278
who I happen to know
is completely crazy.

817
00:59:03,353 --> 00:59:05,116
Please, make it stop.

818
00:59:05,188 --> 00:59:08,351
I can't say that to her.
I have to be supportive, right?

819
00:59:09,326 --> 00:59:12,352
Wait a minute. Haven't we
passed this tree before?

820
00:59:13,163 --> 00:59:16,997
No, you're mistaken.
We've been walking for hours.

821
00:59:17,067 --> 00:59:20,059
- But I tinkled there.
- You what?

822
00:59:20,136 --> 00:59:22,127
You tinkled?

823
00:59:22,205 --> 00:59:23,399
Can't you tell?

824
00:59:26,610 --> 00:59:31,206
Oh, my... You can't smell, can you?

825
00:59:34,517 --> 00:59:36,985
- No.
- What happened?

826
00:59:37,053 --> 00:59:39,214
It's OK, you can tell me.

827
00:59:40,423 --> 00:59:42,721
I didn't... quit the police force.

828
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:47,260
They let me go because
I could no longer follow a scent.

829
00:59:49,099 --> 00:59:51,192
Now we're out here walking in circles.

830
00:59:52,202 --> 00:59:53,396
I'm sorry, kid.

831
00:59:55,171 --> 00:59:57,230
- What's that?
- Mountain lions!

832
00:59:57,774 --> 01:00:00,538
- I'm scared, Delgado.
- I know.

833
01:00:01,278 --> 01:00:03,872
We better get moving.
We got to get out of the open.

834
01:00:03,947 --> 01:00:05,642
- OK.
- Let's go. Double time.

835
01:00:18,061 --> 01:00:21,622
Delgado, what happened to you?

836
01:00:21,698 --> 01:00:23,689
Why can't you smell anything?

837
01:00:28,838 --> 01:00:30,169
Well...

838
01:00:32,509 --> 01:00:36,741
My partner and I...
we were on a major bust.

839
01:00:38,415 --> 01:00:39,677
<i>I was on point.</i>

840
01:00:40,650 --> 01:00:44,711
<i>Before I knew it I was blind-sided.</i>
<i>Then it all went bad.</i>

841
01:00:49,426 --> 01:00:52,953
<i>While I was down,</i>
<i>my partner got hurt.</i>

842
01:00:55,966 --> 01:01:00,494
<i>He was never the same after that.</i>
<i>And neither was I.</i>

843
01:01:04,908 --> 01:01:07,103
I should have sensed him coming.

844
01:01:07,177 --> 01:01:10,203
Next day I woke up
and couldn't smell a thing.

845
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:12,180
Were you hurt?

846
01:01:12,248 --> 01:01:14,739
No. They say it's all in my head.

847
01:01:15,852 --> 01:01:17,149
In my head.

848
01:01:18,321 --> 01:01:19,310
They found us!

849
01:01:19,389 --> 01:01:22,722
I'll hold them off as long as I can
while you run. Understand?

850
01:01:22,792 --> 01:01:24,783
They're just cats.
You could take them.

851
01:01:27,130 --> 01:01:29,724
We need a miracle. Run when I say run!

852
01:01:30,367 --> 01:01:32,392
Come on! Take them!

853
01:01:32,469 --> 01:01:33,766
Yeah, you can do it!

854
01:01:35,505 --> 01:01:36,767
Don't be afraid!

855
01:01:38,308 --> 01:01:40,742
Go, Delgado! Go, Delgado!

856
01:01:43,513 --> 01:01:45,845
- Run, kid! Run, now!
- OK, OK.

857
01:01:45,915 --> 01:01:47,507
- Run and hide!
- Here. I'm here.

858
01:01:47,584 --> 01:01:49,313
This is not hiding.

859
01:02:14,511 --> 01:02:16,604
Say hello to my little friends.

860
01:02:23,453 --> 01:02:25,683
Whoa! That's some bark you guys got.

861
01:02:25,755 --> 01:02:29,213
I am Montezuma!
Come with us if you want to live.

862
01:02:29,292 --> 01:02:31,419
Yeah, I want to live.

863
01:02:32,295 --> 01:02:33,762
Now I've seen it all.

864
01:02:38,802 --> 01:02:42,169
Can you help us get back
to civilization, Montezuma?

865
01:02:42,238 --> 01:02:43,671
Of course.

866
01:02:43,740 --> 01:02:46,937
But it is too dangerous
to travel these canyons after dark.

867
01:02:47,010 --> 01:02:49,877
You will spend the night here with us.

868
01:02:49,946 --> 01:02:51,607
Where are we?

869
01:02:51,681 --> 01:02:56,175
You are in Chihuahua.
Birthplace of our mighty breed.

870
01:02:56,252 --> 01:02:58,812
I was born in Beverly Hills.

871
01:02:58,888 --> 01:03:02,881
<i>Sí,</i> but your ancestors
came from here.

872
01:03:03,993 --> 01:03:08,157
The Aztec people left long ago,
but we remain.

873
01:03:10,533 --> 01:03:12,467
Wow.

874
01:03:27,350 --> 01:03:29,341
Did you hear what he said, Delgado?

875
01:03:29,419 --> 01:03:33,185
- I come from a mighty breed.
- Yeah, mighty annoying.

876
01:03:33,256 --> 01:03:37,022
You're just mad because
we were saved by little dogs.

877
01:03:37,093 --> 01:03:38,321
Very little dogs.

878
01:03:40,230 --> 01:03:43,028
Tonight we celebrate your arrival.

879
01:03:44,134 --> 01:03:45,863
Thank you, Montezuma.

880
01:03:45,935 --> 01:03:48,597
Please, call me Monte.

881
01:03:49,539 --> 01:03:51,530
<i>Ay yi yi.</i>

882
01:03:57,947 --> 01:04:00,677
Wow! All this for me, Monte?

883
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:02,183
Yes, Chloe.

884
01:04:02,252 --> 01:04:06,211
When a Chihuahua comes home,
it is cause for celebration.

885
01:04:06,289 --> 01:04:08,917
Even a Beverly Hills Chihuahua?

886
01:04:08,992 --> 01:04:13,952
Of course. No matter where
you come from, you are one of us.

887
01:04:14,030 --> 01:04:16,931
Tiny but mighty.

888
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:21,334
Mighty? But I'm just... a lapdog.

889
01:04:21,404 --> 01:04:23,269
A lapdog? No.

890
01:04:24,007 --> 01:04:28,103
Do not insult yourself. Do not insult
the Chihuahua race.

891
01:04:28,178 --> 01:04:31,170
- <i> No más.</i>
- No más?

892
01:04:31,247 --> 01:04:35,081
<i>Sí,</i> it means "no more."

893
01:04:35,151 --> 01:04:39,611
We Chihuahuas are not toys
or fashion accessories.

894
01:04:39,689 --> 01:04:41,020
<i> No más.</i>

895
01:04:41,090 --> 01:04:45,686
We were not bred to wear silly hats
and ride in purses!

896
01:04:45,762 --> 01:04:46,888
<i>No más.</i>

897
01:04:46,963 --> 01:04:50,831
We will no longer
be spoken to with baby talk.

898
01:04:50,900 --> 01:04:54,859
We have been called "teacup"
and "tiny toy" for too long.

899
01:04:54,938 --> 01:04:56,337
<i>No más!</i>

900
01:04:56,406 --> 01:04:59,068
Names like Fifi, Foo-Foo...

901
01:04:59,142 --> 01:05:01,940
Pookie, Pumpkin, or Squirt.

902
01:05:02,011 --> 01:05:03,342
<i>No más!</i>

903
01:05:03,413 --> 01:05:08,476
Yes, we Chihuahuas shake, but not for
the amusement of humans.

904
01:05:08,551 --> 01:05:13,614
We shake because we know the power
of our inner strength. Our bark.

905
01:05:13,690 --> 01:05:14,714
<i>No más!</i>

906
01:05:14,791 --> 01:05:18,887
Yes, we are tiny, but we are mighty!

907
01:05:18,962 --> 01:05:22,955
<i>No más! No más! No más!</i>

908
01:05:23,032 --> 01:05:28,197
Join with us, Chloe.
Embrace <i>no más.</i> Find your bark.

909
01:05:28,271 --> 01:05:30,705
My bark?

910
01:05:30,773 --> 01:05:34,265
<i>Sí!</i> That which makes you mighty.

911
01:05:34,344 --> 01:05:37,006
That which makes you... you.

912
01:05:37,714 --> 01:05:41,548
We are Chihuahuas, hear us roar.

913
01:05:50,827 --> 01:05:52,226
That was embarrassing.

914
01:05:52,295 --> 01:05:56,561
Don't worry, little one. Your bark will
come when you need it most.

915
01:06:29,098 --> 01:06:30,759
Last one in the house is a chew toy!

916
01:06:33,236 --> 01:06:34,225
They have room.

917
01:06:34,304 --> 01:06:35,862
Come on. Little more.

918
01:06:35,938 --> 01:06:38,429
- You got it now. Now pull.
- I got it, I got it.

919
01:06:38,508 --> 01:06:41,409
- Sweet smell of success.
- I'm smelling something else.

920
01:06:42,845 --> 01:06:47,248
There's the bag. There's the bag that's
got my diamonds. Hey, watch your nose!

921
01:06:47,317 --> 01:06:49,785
I don't feel right about this.

922
01:06:49,852 --> 01:06:52,753
Look, my neck flap is swelling up.

923
01:06:53,423 --> 01:06:57,223
Stop with the guilt.
Iguanas are supposed to be cold-blooded.

924
01:06:57,293 --> 01:07:01,457
You know I was born in captivity.
I grew up under a heat lamp.

925
01:07:01,531 --> 01:07:03,522
Snap out of it. We got a job to do.

926
01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:07,228
Ah-hah! You're the pack rat
who stole the collar!

927
01:07:07,303 --> 01:07:09,794
See? You're so busted, Manuel.

928
01:07:09,872 --> 01:07:14,036
Hey, dude, you got me mixed up with
another rat. You know we all look alike.

929
01:07:14,110 --> 01:07:16,340
- No, no. It's him. He did it.
- What?

930
01:07:16,412 --> 01:07:18,846
Now the love of my life
is out there in trouble.

931
01:07:18,915 --> 01:07:20,542
- Not because of us.
- No?

932
01:07:20,616 --> 01:07:22,743
- We were trying to... save her.
- Yeah.

933
01:07:22,819 --> 01:07:25,014
From the demon dog that's hunting her.

934
01:07:25,088 --> 01:07:27,818
Tell me about this demon dog.

935
01:07:55,585 --> 01:07:59,316
Chloe, you can always stay here with us.

936
01:08:00,123 --> 01:08:02,717
This place is amazing, Monte.

937
01:08:02,792 --> 01:08:07,786
But there's someone at home who's
probably worried and missing me...

938
01:08:07,864 --> 01:08:09,832
and I miss him.

939
01:08:09,899 --> 01:08:11,958
Your <i>corazón?</i>

940
01:08:12,034 --> 01:08:15,492
<i>Mi corazón.</i> What does that mean?

941
01:08:15,571 --> 01:08:17,266
My heart.

942
01:08:18,441 --> 01:08:21,035
I never even gave him a chance.

943
01:08:21,110 --> 01:08:24,944
We Chihuahuas come
in many shapes and colors...

944
01:08:25,014 --> 01:08:29,951
but when you look not with your eyes,
but with your soul,

945
01:08:30,019 --> 01:08:32,647
there we're all the same.

946
01:08:32,722 --> 01:08:36,658
Listen... back there with the lions...

947
01:08:36,726 --> 01:08:40,423
...uh... uh... thanks.

948
01:08:40,496 --> 01:08:44,728
But of course. We are Chihuahuas.

949
01:08:47,437 --> 01:08:51,635
Ah! Civilization at last.
We made it, Delgado.

950
01:08:52,341 --> 01:08:54,241
- Delgado!
- Just keep paddling!

951
01:08:54,310 --> 01:08:56,642
Whoa!

952
01:08:56,712 --> 01:09:00,671
- That was fun!
- Yeah, you're a real aquatic goddess.

953
01:09:01,250 --> 01:09:03,878
- Delgado, look!
- What?

954
01:09:03,953 --> 01:09:06,478
Is that you? Nice toga.

955
01:09:06,556 --> 01:09:10,014
I can't believe Rachel's looking for me.

956
01:09:10,092 --> 01:09:11,582
Let's get some help.

957
01:09:23,439 --> 01:09:25,168
- Chloe.
- <i>Sí.</i>

958
01:09:37,954 --> 01:09:41,583
We always kept a dog
when my husband was alive.

959
01:09:43,292 --> 01:09:48,252
He'd make a great companion.
You guys are perfect for each other.

960
01:09:48,331 --> 01:09:50,265
Somebody's got a lady friend.

961
01:09:50,333 --> 01:09:52,164
I have a home.

962
01:09:53,035 --> 01:09:57,165
We're on our way. Hey, Rachel,
that was Ramirez. They found Chloe.

963
01:10:06,883 --> 01:10:08,908
Whoa. Awkward.

964
01:10:10,586 --> 01:10:13,783
We should go.
Ramirez is going to meet us there.

965
01:10:13,856 --> 01:10:16,086
I told you,
everything's going to be fine.

966
01:10:30,973 --> 01:10:32,406
This is the place.

967
01:10:36,445 --> 01:10:37,434
Chloe!

968
01:10:43,286 --> 01:10:44,275
Hello?

969
01:10:45,154 --> 01:10:48,988
OK, how about here?
You American dogs are so picky.

970
01:10:51,727 --> 01:10:54,662
OK, go. What?

971
01:10:56,465 --> 01:11:00,367
Ah. Excuse me, <i>señorita.</i>
Please, please, go.

972
01:11:05,775 --> 01:11:08,107
I've seen that <i>gringo</i> before.

973
01:11:11,147 --> 01:11:14,583
<i>Oye,</i> that van.
My Chloe's been there.

974
01:11:14,650 --> 01:11:16,914
Right on, Mighty Dog. Power to the Papi.

975
01:11:16,986 --> 01:11:19,352
- Now go get her!
- Go get your <i>princesa.</i>

976
01:11:19,422 --> 01:11:21,652
- <i>¡Mi corazón!</i>
- So romantic.

977
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:26,721
Man, I thought we'd
never get rid of him.

978
01:11:26,796 --> 01:11:29,424
- Come on.
- Now I'll finally get my diamonds.

979
01:11:29,498 --> 01:11:31,693
For the love of a banana,
hurry. Ow!

980
01:11:42,278 --> 01:11:43,267
<i>Señora?</i>

981
01:11:46,415 --> 01:11:48,747
Oh, no. No!

982
01:11:51,354 --> 01:11:52,480
Chloe!

983
01:11:54,857 --> 01:11:57,451
- Turn me loose!
- What did he say?

984
01:11:57,526 --> 01:11:59,960
- Don't worry, we're going to find her.
- What?

985
01:12:00,029 --> 01:12:01,291
Oh!

986
01:12:02,298 --> 01:12:03,629
I'm going to look for her.

987
01:12:05,434 --> 01:12:06,423
Kid!

988
01:12:09,705 --> 01:12:12,367
Kid! Where are you? Chloe!

989
01:12:13,809 --> 01:12:17,404
Where are you taking me?

990
01:12:36,532 --> 01:12:38,693
Good job, Diablo. Good job.

991
01:12:42,838 --> 01:12:46,399
You've been a lot of trouble, huh?
I hope you're worth it.

992
01:12:46,475 --> 01:12:49,069
I need to call the owners,
so get the dog in the van.

993
01:12:49,145 --> 01:12:50,237
Yes, sir.

994
01:12:57,153 --> 01:12:58,381
Surprise!

995
01:13:00,089 --> 01:13:02,649
Don't mess with a Chihuahua!

996
01:13:05,394 --> 01:13:07,692
Papi! What are you doing here!

997
01:13:07,763 --> 01:13:09,958
Rescuing you. Run!

998
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:12,360
- Come on.
- I'm coming.

999
01:13:14,270 --> 01:13:15,737
Go! Diablo, go!

1000
01:13:17,373 --> 01:13:20,274
- Get that Chihuahua!
- Which one?

1001
01:13:20,342 --> 01:13:21,502
- The mean one!
- Papi!

1002
01:13:21,577 --> 01:13:24,478
- We're trapped!
- I will protect you, <i>mi corazón.</i>

1003
01:13:30,086 --> 01:13:31,519
Hold on, Chloe!

1004
01:13:31,954 --> 01:13:33,546
Come on, little brat.

1005
01:13:40,429 --> 01:13:41,521
Ow!

1006
01:13:41,597 --> 01:13:43,861
Oh, my back. I need an aspirin.

1007
01:13:43,933 --> 01:13:46,163
- Doesn't that hurt?
- You see a tooth around?

1008
01:13:46,235 --> 01:13:48,203
You two! What are you doing here?

1009
01:13:48,270 --> 01:13:49,567
It's not what you think.

1010
01:13:49,638 --> 01:13:52,698
Look... we're not trying
to steal this collar.

1011
01:13:52,775 --> 01:13:54,709
- Right.
- Maybe we are.

1012
01:13:54,777 --> 01:13:57,746
Look, what my partner's
trying to say is, if you hurry,

1013
01:13:57,813 --> 01:14:00,043
- you can pick up her scent using this.
- Yeah.

1014
01:14:01,183 --> 01:14:03,048
- I can't.
- What?

1015
01:14:03,119 --> 01:14:06,088
I make this noble gesture,
you're not even going to try?

1016
01:14:06,155 --> 01:14:09,022
What's the point of having that
thing on the end of your face?

1017
01:14:10,659 --> 01:14:13,059
- I can't!
- She needs you, man.

1018
01:14:13,129 --> 01:14:16,724
- What part don't you understand?
- She needs you, man!

1019
01:14:16,799 --> 01:14:18,858
You can do it! Smell.

1020
01:14:21,670 --> 01:14:24,332
- That's it.
- You can do it, Delgado. Come on.

1021
01:14:25,074 --> 01:14:27,372
Smell.

1022
01:14:27,443 --> 01:14:31,174
I'm getting something. Pack rat.

1023
01:14:32,081 --> 01:14:33,912
Old nachos.

1024
01:14:35,918 --> 01:14:38,352
Chanel No. 5.

1025
01:14:38,854 --> 01:14:40,253
He's got it!

1026
01:14:40,756 --> 01:14:42,383
I have a Chihuahua to save.

1027
01:14:44,593 --> 01:14:46,925
- He's got my collar!
- Yeah, he's got it.

1028
01:14:46,996 --> 01:14:50,261
You did a good thing, Manuel.
You know you did a good thing.

1029
01:14:50,332 --> 01:14:54,029
You're blushing. You're blushing.

1030
01:14:58,073 --> 01:14:59,768
That's Chloe's collar.

1031
01:15:00,843 --> 01:15:04,904
He wants to lead us
to the Chihuahua. Let's go.

1032
01:15:13,722 --> 01:15:17,021
Be careful.
The whole structure is crumbling.

1033
01:15:24,133 --> 01:15:26,601
Rafferty,
there's no sign of the dog.

1034
01:15:26,669 --> 01:15:29,433
Hey, tough guy,
you're lucky I'm locked in.

1035
01:15:29,505 --> 01:15:30,836
Rafferty, come in.

1036
01:15:31,974 --> 01:15:33,339
You look confused.

1037
01:15:33,409 --> 01:15:36,867
Hey, man, where you going?
To find the rest of your tail?

1038
01:15:36,946 --> 01:15:38,573
Rafferty, come in.

1039
01:15:41,217 --> 01:15:45,017
I know you're here, <i>chica.</i>
I can smell you.

1040
01:15:45,087 --> 01:15:47,055
Rafferty, come in, come in.

1041
01:15:49,792 --> 01:15:52,283
- <i>Rafferty.</i>
- Sorry, you're breaking up, boss.

1042
01:15:57,066 --> 01:15:59,091
I'm going to get you now, you rat.

1043
01:16:02,705 --> 01:16:04,297
Hello. One down.

1044
01:16:06,375 --> 01:16:09,742
Rafferty, what's going on?
Talk to me. What's going on?

1045
01:16:09,812 --> 01:16:11,803
- Chloe, you're okay.
- Shhh.

1046
01:16:12,448 --> 01:16:14,348
Come in. I cannot hear you. Come on.

1047
01:16:16,285 --> 01:16:19,550
- Who you been hanging around with?
- Diablo, let's get out...

1048
01:16:20,522 --> 01:16:22,285
- Get them. Get them!
- Run!

1049
01:16:22,358 --> 01:16:23,882
- Follow me!
- We can do it!

1050
01:16:23,959 --> 01:16:27,326
Whoa, you heard the man.
Come on, get me.

1051
01:16:27,396 --> 01:16:28,693
Too slow, gotta go!

1052
01:16:32,568 --> 01:16:34,627
Come here. Come here!

1053
01:16:36,872 --> 01:16:40,399
You better watch out, dog.
I'm going to beat you like a piñata!

1054
01:16:40,476 --> 01:16:42,376
They don't call me
Papi Loco for nothing!

1055
01:16:42,444 --> 01:16:45,174
Come on, little rat. Come on!

1056
01:16:45,748 --> 01:16:47,306
- Whoa!
- Papi!

1057
01:16:47,383 --> 01:16:50,216
Say goodbye to your <i>corazón.</i>

1058
01:16:50,286 --> 01:16:53,619
<i>No... más.</i>

1059
01:16:54,623 --> 01:16:56,750
<i>No más.</i>

1060
01:16:56,825 --> 01:16:57,849
It's over.

1061
01:16:57,927 --> 01:17:00,157
- Chloe!
- <i>No más!</i>

1062
01:17:03,966 --> 01:17:05,831
Wow! That's my bark.

1063
01:17:17,513 --> 01:17:19,037
I barked!

1064
01:17:21,183 --> 01:17:22,707
I barked!

1065
01:17:27,623 --> 01:17:28,817
Two down.

1066
01:17:28,891 --> 01:17:30,290
He's all yours, Officer.

1067
01:17:32,094 --> 01:17:33,527
<i>Señor</i> Vasquez.

1068
01:17:33,595 --> 01:17:35,222
- Did you see that?
- Wow.

1069
01:17:35,297 --> 01:17:36,286
I barked!

1070
01:17:36,365 --> 01:17:39,801
<i>Ai, Mami!</i> Nice set of pipes!

1071
01:17:39,868 --> 01:17:41,893
Run!

1072
01:17:41,971 --> 01:17:44,405
It's time to finish what I started.

1073
01:17:44,473 --> 01:17:46,600
You don't scare me anymore!

1074
01:17:46,675 --> 01:17:48,540
Then why are you shaking?

1075
01:17:48,610 --> 01:17:50,339
Because I am a Chihuahua!

1076
01:17:52,214 --> 01:17:53,408
Diablo!

1077
01:17:54,249 --> 01:17:55,910
Big mistake.

1078
01:17:55,985 --> 01:17:57,680
Leave him alone!

1079
01:17:57,753 --> 01:18:01,348
- Chloe, what are you doing?
- You owe me a cashmere sweater.

1080
01:18:01,423 --> 01:18:03,550
- Hang on, Chloe!
- Kid, hang on.

1081
01:18:03,625 --> 01:18:05,855
- How dare you!
- Chloe, watch out!

1082
01:18:10,933 --> 01:18:13,925
It's over, Diablo! It is over!

1083
01:18:14,003 --> 01:18:16,369
You took everything from me.

1084
01:18:16,438 --> 01:18:19,339
Now, we're even.

1085
01:18:19,441 --> 01:18:20,499
Chloe?

1086
01:18:21,710 --> 01:18:23,940
Mi corazón?

1087
01:18:29,551 --> 01:18:30,609
Kid?

1088
01:18:31,687 --> 01:18:34,520
She's... gone.

1089
01:18:36,191 --> 01:18:37,749
Wake up, <i>mi corazón.</i>

1090
01:18:38,827 --> 01:18:41,990
It's me. Your Papi.

1091
01:18:43,499 --> 01:18:44,625
Speak to me.

1092
01:18:45,401 --> 01:18:48,768
Fill my ears with your beautiful voice.

1093
01:18:49,972 --> 01:18:54,375
Without you, the sun
will have no warmth...

1094
01:18:54,443 --> 01:18:56,741
the flowers, no beauty.

1095
01:18:57,846 --> 01:19:01,680
Chloe, my tail will have no wag.

1096
01:19:02,518 --> 01:19:07,717
Come back to Beverly Hills with me,
and I will tend your garden forever.

1097
01:19:08,757 --> 01:19:12,989
Your love is the rain
that falls upon my earth.

1098
01:19:14,463 --> 01:19:16,988
Don't stop now. It's just getting good.

1099
01:19:17,299 --> 01:19:19,096
<i>Ai Chihuahua!</i>

1100
01:19:19,168 --> 01:19:22,535
Papi, that was beautiful.

1101
01:19:22,604 --> 01:19:25,129
Chloe, you're back. You're back.

1102
01:19:25,207 --> 01:19:26,401
Chloe?

1103
01:19:26,475 --> 01:19:27,806
She's back!

1104
01:19:29,812 --> 01:19:31,143
You're OK.

1105
01:19:32,347 --> 01:19:35,214
Chloe, where have you been?

1106
01:19:36,285 --> 01:19:40,551
Rachel, you missed all the fun.

1107
01:19:41,790 --> 01:19:44,020
You are one tough Chihuahua.

1108
01:19:44,093 --> 01:19:47,085
Tiny but mighty.

1109
01:19:47,162 --> 01:19:48,561
Hi, Chloe.

1110
01:19:51,133 --> 01:19:53,158
Hi. Hi.

1111
01:20:12,754 --> 01:20:15,552
So you're the... guard dog.

1112
01:20:16,191 --> 01:20:19,388
No, man. I'm a landscaper.

1113
01:20:19,761 --> 01:20:22,389
- Oops.
- Right.

1114
01:20:23,098 --> 01:20:24,759
Well, <i>adiós,</i> kid.

1115
01:20:25,534 --> 01:20:27,627
Oh, uh... Delgado.

1116
01:20:27,703 --> 01:20:31,867
You know,
Vivian could still use a guard dog.

1117
01:20:31,940 --> 01:20:36,104
Thanks for the offer,
but someone has to go after El Diablo.

1118
01:20:36,178 --> 01:20:41,047
Besides, <i>princesa,</i> I think you
can take care of things yourself now.

1119
01:20:41,483 --> 01:20:43,508
I'll miss you.

1120
01:20:43,585 --> 01:20:47,817
Yeah, I'll miss you, too, kid.
But this isn't goodbye.

1121
01:20:48,724 --> 01:20:50,851
I'm sure we'll be
seeing each other again.

1122
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,662
Don't turn around. Don't turn around.

1123
01:21:03,338 --> 01:21:06,171
Maybe you could use
a little extra help on the force.

1124
01:21:09,244 --> 01:21:11,405
Where do you think
you are going, officer?

1125
01:21:25,027 --> 01:21:26,619
Ready to get back on the job?

1126
01:21:28,697 --> 01:21:30,187
Officer!

1127
01:21:34,870 --> 01:21:37,668
Yeah. Good boy. Good boy.

1128
01:21:43,111 --> 01:21:45,739
Chloe! Papi! Let's go home.

1129
01:21:46,215 --> 01:21:48,240
We gotta get home before Aunt Viv does.

1130
01:21:49,952 --> 01:21:51,385
Hey, come here.

1131
01:21:52,955 --> 01:21:54,980
Goodbye, my friends.

1132
01:21:56,525 --> 01:22:00,484
- <i>Adiós, amigo.</i>
- <i> Adiós,</i> kid.

1133
01:22:00,562 --> 01:22:02,621
<i>Muchas gracias,</i> Delgado.

1134
01:22:04,032 --> 01:22:08,799
Thank you, Chloe.
I've never had a friend like you.

1135
01:22:13,175 --> 01:22:16,702
Great, she's not home yet.
She'll be here any minute.

1136
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:21,114
- Can you get the bags?
- Yeah, I'll get the bags.

1137
01:22:21,183 --> 01:22:23,481
- I'll put her in the tub.
- Go, go, go.

1138
01:22:23,552 --> 01:22:24,541
Hurry up!

1139
01:22:25,687 --> 01:22:27,348
Come on. We're going to make it.

1140
01:22:29,157 --> 01:22:30,556
Oh-oh. Think fast, <i>amigo.</i>

1141
01:22:35,464 --> 01:22:38,797
Hi! How are you? Welcome.

1142
01:22:38,867 --> 01:22:43,201
- Welcome. Hi.
- What a surprise. Hello.

1143
01:22:43,272 --> 01:22:46,139
I took photographs
of the most wonderful gardens.

1144
01:22:46,208 --> 01:22:49,268
You're not going to believe.
First, I want to go see Chloe.

1145
01:22:49,344 --> 01:22:53,747
- Actually, I need you to see something.
- That's the best you can do?

1146
01:22:53,815 --> 01:22:56,750
- Something you're gonna love.
- Should I bite her leg?

1147
01:22:56,818 --> 01:23:00,618
By the way, you look exhausted.
You've been working too hard.

1148
01:23:00,689 --> 01:23:04,216
Chloe? Chloe.

1149
01:23:04,293 --> 01:23:06,659
- Sam, put my bags over there, please?
- Yes.

1150
01:23:06,728 --> 01:23:10,391
Chloe? Rachel?

1151
01:23:10,465 --> 01:23:13,559
- Hi, Aunt Viv.
- Hi.

1152
01:23:13,635 --> 01:23:15,432
- Hi.
- Hi.

1153
01:23:17,673 --> 01:23:19,334
Your hair is all wet.

1154
01:23:20,008 --> 01:23:21,805
I was in a bath.

1155
01:23:21,877 --> 01:23:25,643
- Oh. Where's my Chloe?
- There she is.

1156
01:23:26,348 --> 01:23:28,213
Hi, sweetheart.

1157
01:23:29,184 --> 01:23:32,950
Hi. Come here.
Hi, sweetheart.

1158
01:23:34,056 --> 01:23:37,685
My baby girl. My sweet angel.

1159
01:23:37,759 --> 01:23:39,727
I missed you so much. I did.

1160
01:23:39,795 --> 01:23:41,160
Yes, I did.

1161
01:23:41,897 --> 01:23:44,730
What's that smell? What's that...

1162
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:49,362
It's sort of... urban and...

1163
01:23:49,438 --> 01:23:53,602
kind of earthy... and it's fabulous.

1164
01:23:53,675 --> 01:23:55,700
That's Mexico No. 5.

1165
01:23:57,879 --> 01:24:01,872
I can't believe I'm running over
a pond in my best dress.

1166
01:24:01,950 --> 01:24:06,080
So does this mean you're no longer a
prissy Beverly Hills Chihuahua?

1167
01:24:06,154 --> 01:24:10,284
Beverly Hills, <i>sí.</i> Prissy,
<i>no más.</i>

1168
01:24:10,992 --> 01:24:14,860
How do you say "What are you doing
on Friday night" in Spanish?

1169
01:24:22,437 --> 01:24:25,929
Me? Nothing. And you?

1170
01:24:26,007 --> 01:24:29,568
- <i>Nada.</i>
- <i>Bueno,</i> let's...

1171
01:24:29,644 --> 01:24:32,238
After the way I treated you,

1172
01:24:32,314 --> 01:24:35,511
I can't believe you came after me.

1173
01:24:35,584 --> 01:24:37,347
How could I not?

1174
01:24:43,892 --> 01:24:47,089
I think I'm... going to cry.

1175
01:24:51,466 --> 01:24:54,196
Oh, Chloe.

1176
01:24:54,269 --> 01:24:57,534
Papi likes.

1177
01:25:03,779 --> 01:25:05,713

<i>El Diablo was adopted by a rich lady</i>
