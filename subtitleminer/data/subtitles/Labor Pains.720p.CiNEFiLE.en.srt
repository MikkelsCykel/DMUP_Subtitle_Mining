00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,431
The I-10 Santa Monica
Freeway westbound

2
00:00:42,504 --> 00:00:44,563
is jammed due to
a three-car accident...

3
00:00:44,639 --> 00:00:47,233
blocking lanes one and two
just past Hoover Street.

4
00:00:46,308 --> 00:00:49,869
In Van Nuys there's stop and go
traffic on the 405 southbound...

5
00:00:49,945 --> 00:00:51,936
Hey, loser!
Get up. You're late.

6
00:00:54,316 --> 00:00:55,613
We need money.

7
00:00:55,684 --> 00:00:56,878
For what?

8
00:00:56,952 --> 00:00:58,613
Food.

9
00:01:06,462 --> 00:01:09,056
I've only got two dollars.
How much is a Happy Meal?

10
00:01:09,131 --> 00:01:10,291
Oopf.

11
00:01:13,202 --> 00:01:14,760
Good morning, Thea.

12
00:01:14,837 --> 00:01:16,168
Oh, hi.

13
00:01:16,238 --> 00:01:18,365
There's this
thing called rent.

14
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,431
Monday.
You have my word.

15
00:01:20,509 --> 00:01:22,636
Could you put your
word on an actual check?

16
00:02:28,577 --> 00:02:31,774
Whoo! Look
at that foxy momma!

17
00:02:31,847 --> 00:02:33,212
Hey.

18
00:02:33,282 --> 00:02:36,911
Hey, look. I, uh, I
saved you one of these.

19
00:02:36,986 --> 00:02:39,113
It wasn't easy. These
people are animals.

20
00:02:39,188 --> 00:02:41,383
Thanks. It's all
downhill after the donut.

21
00:02:41,457 --> 00:02:43,584
Hey. Let's go
camping right now.

22
00:02:43,659 --> 00:02:45,559
Oh, don't tempt me.
You know I can't.

23
00:02:45,628 --> 00:02:49,621
Come on. Don't be such a buzz
kill. Just call in sick from work.

24
00:02:49,698 --> 00:02:52,428
Oh, Miles. It was hard
enough getting Monday off.

25
00:02:52,501 --> 00:02:55,197
Hey. You really need to
bail on this lame job, babe.

26
00:02:55,271 --> 00:02:58,798
Bailing isn't exactly in my vocabulary
right now. I'm late. I'm late.

27
00:03:06,448 --> 00:03:08,075
Alarm clock
on the fritz again?

28
00:03:09,852 --> 00:03:11,376
Thea.

29
00:03:11,453 --> 00:03:12,943
Thea!

30
00:03:17,293 --> 00:03:19,124
Four minutes
after nine, Thea.

31
00:03:19,194 --> 00:03:21,059
We agreed to 8:59.

32
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:23,690
I know. I'm sorry. I've
got your coffee piping hot.

33
00:03:23,766 --> 00:03:26,200
Greg already
got it for me.

34
00:03:26,268 --> 00:03:28,065
All right.
Let's get started.

35
00:03:28,137 --> 00:03:30,901
I found two errors
in your transcription.

36
00:03:30,973 --> 00:03:34,739
Ur-Nammu, the Mesopotamian
ruler, has a hyphen in his name.

37
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:37,745
Are you sure? I checked it
in Oxford English Dictionary.

38
00:03:37,813 --> 00:03:41,180
You should always cross reference
with the Military Encyclopedia.

39
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,740
It is
the definitive source.

40
00:03:42,818 --> 00:03:44,308
Absolutely right, Greg.

41
00:03:44,386 --> 00:03:47,184
The intern shouldn't be
more thorough than you.

42
00:03:47,256 --> 00:03:51,352
You have to remember that every
mistake you make, impacts history.

43
00:03:51,427 --> 00:03:53,361
I'm sorry I didn't give enough thought

44
00:03:53,429 --> 00:03:55,897
to the long reaching
impact of a missing hyphen.

45
00:03:55,965 --> 00:03:58,229
Think of it next time,
or someone else will.

46
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,758
There are a million people out
there who'd kill for your job.

47
00:04:01,837 --> 00:04:05,364
The secretary to the publisher,
it's a dream for so many of us.

48
00:04:05,441 --> 00:04:07,909
I have a big
project for you.

49
00:04:07,977 --> 00:04:11,674
Now, you can make up for this
morning's mistakes by acing this one.

50
00:04:11,747 --> 00:04:13,510
Okay. What
can I do for you?

51
00:04:13,582 --> 00:04:17,143
MacArthur rolled
in some poop.

52
00:04:17,219 --> 00:04:18,516
Again?

53
00:04:18,587 --> 00:04:20,179
She's got one
good eye, Thea.

54
00:04:20,255 --> 00:04:23,554
I don't appreciate
you taking that tone. Now.

55
00:04:25,928 --> 00:04:27,657
Hi, there.

56
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:31,689
Let's really try and nail
it this time, shall we?

57
00:04:40,109 --> 00:04:41,872
No way. She
rolled in poop again?

58
00:04:41,944 --> 00:04:43,172
Uh-hm.

59
00:04:43,245 --> 00:04:44,906
How come Greg never washes her?

60
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:47,505
I'm glad that I don't have
to wash the poop off Greg

61
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:50,609
since he spends most of his time
with his head up Jerry's ass.

62
00:04:50,686 --> 00:04:53,655
Tell me about it. Last week
he CC'd me on an email to Jerry

63
00:04:53,722 --> 00:04:56,589
complaining that I ordered
too many rainbow Post-Its.

64
00:04:56,658 --> 00:04:58,455
Said it creates
a party atmosphere.

65
00:04:58,527 --> 00:05:00,620
Come here, MacArthur.

66
00:05:00,696 --> 00:05:03,358
MacArthur.

67
00:05:03,432 --> 00:05:05,764
Do you think we'll
ever get out of here?

68
00:05:05,834 --> 00:05:09,099
How long 'til your little
sister graduates college?

69
00:05:09,171 --> 00:05:11,162
Five years.
Five long years.

70
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,265
Wow.

71
00:05:13,342 --> 00:05:16,140
When you finally ditch this
place I'm gonna leave, too.

72
00:05:16,211 --> 00:05:18,372
I can't survive this
hellhole without you.

73
00:05:18,447 --> 00:05:21,473
I don't even know if I'm gonna
survive Monday without you.

74
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,848
Oh, well, your rainbow
Post-Its should help.

75
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:26,547
Ha, ha, ha.
Just promise me

76
00:05:26,622 --> 00:05:30,991
that when you're celebrating with Miles the
big 25, you'll have two extra shots for me.

77
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,654
Done. Two for
you, two for me

78
00:05:33,729 --> 00:05:35,219
and two
for MacArthur.

79
00:05:35,297 --> 00:05:37,458
And cold beer chasers and a sliced lime.

80
00:05:37,533 --> 00:05:39,000
Gets me right here.

81
00:05:43,172 --> 00:05:44,662
What is MacArthur eating?

82
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:47,538
Oh, that's not
good. Hold on.

83
00:05:47,609 --> 00:05:48,769
No, no, that's soap!

84
00:05:53,649 --> 00:05:55,913
Well, Thea, you are
a sopping mess.

85
00:05:55,984 --> 00:05:57,315
I know, I'm sorry.

86
00:05:57,386 --> 00:05:58,580
Well, don't apologize.

87
00:05:58,654 --> 00:06:00,315
This one
has two staples.

88
00:06:00,389 --> 00:06:01,413
Yeah. And?

89
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:02,821
It's bad feng shui.

90
00:06:02,891 --> 00:06:04,381
It'd be nice
to give the agenda

91
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,519
to the guy
the disability first.

92
00:06:06,595 --> 00:06:08,529
When I gave you yours
first last month,

93
00:06:08,597 --> 00:06:11,327
you reprimanded me for
giving you special treatment.

94
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,698
I don't like your giving
me special back talk.

95
00:06:13,769 --> 00:06:16,397
Good morning, everyone.
Ready for Abbott?

96
00:06:17,606 --> 00:06:18,971
Sorry.

97
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:20,838
Let's have another round!

98
00:06:20,909 --> 00:06:24,174
Hey, Johnny, my good man.
How's the book coming?

99
00:06:24,246 --> 00:06:25,304
Jerry!

100
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,541
War. What is
it good for?

101
00:06:27,616 --> 00:06:31,518
Apparently lots
of things, Jerry.

102
00:06:33,288 --> 00:06:36,155
If you could just tell us
what chapter you're up to.

103
00:06:36,225 --> 00:06:37,351
Sweet.

104
00:06:37,426 --> 00:06:38,825
Pigs in the blanket

105
00:06:38,894 --> 00:06:40,987
for everybody on me.

106
00:06:41,063 --> 00:06:43,463
Alright, bye-bye.

107
00:06:43,532 --> 00:06:45,625
Hemingway used
to write in bars.

108
00:06:45,701 --> 00:06:49,501
Ah. We're so pleased you decided to
bless us with your presence, Nicky

109
00:06:49,571 --> 00:06:52,563
Sorry, uh, bad,
bad traffic.

110
00:06:52,641 --> 00:06:55,542
Hm. Got hung up at the
divorce lawyer's office?

111
00:06:55,611 --> 00:06:58,546
I kind of wanted that
to be private, Jerry.

112
00:06:58,614 --> 00:07:01,139
Well, well, privacy is
for people who are on time.

113
00:07:01,216 --> 00:07:03,207
So how's
Abbott's book coming?

114
00:07:03,285 --> 00:07:08,018
Extremely well. There's a
method to his mad genius.

115
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:11,526
And now we're ready to
go over the cost report.

116
00:07:11,593 --> 00:07:13,584
Whenever you feel
like presenting it.

117
00:07:13,662 --> 00:07:15,630
Oh, okay.

118
00:07:15,697 --> 00:07:19,827
Sales for The Complete History
of Bullets are below projections.

119
00:07:19,902 --> 00:07:23,269
Uh, marketing says people
have been intimidated

120
00:07:23,338 --> 00:07:25,169
by the 1400 page length.

121
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,869
There are a lot of bullets in
the world. We're not making it up.

122
00:07:28,944 --> 00:07:31,936
Let's talk about the next
order of order of business.

123
00:07:32,014 --> 00:07:35,415
I've given this
a lot of thought.

124
00:07:35,484 --> 00:07:39,045
Next week's
softball game.

125
00:07:39,121 --> 00:07:42,921
Now, we're all tired
of losing to Presidio.

126
00:07:42,991 --> 00:07:45,221
So I'm moving Garth
to short stop.

127
00:07:45,294 --> 00:07:47,091
I'm not
quite finished.

128
00:07:47,162 --> 00:07:50,791
I've told you. You're staying
in left field. We need you there.

129
00:07:50,866 --> 00:07:52,458
This isn't softball related.

130
00:07:52,534 --> 00:07:54,934
You know our textbook
writer, Suzie Cavendish?

131
00:07:55,003 --> 00:07:56,027
Of course I know her.

132
00:07:56,104 --> 00:07:57,366
I read her new manuscript

133
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:59,236
and I thought
it was really good.

134
00:07:59,308 --> 00:08:01,708
How did you
get a manuscript?

135
00:08:01,777 --> 00:08:04,245
I ran into her at lunch.
She told me about her book.

136
00:08:04,313 --> 00:08:06,747
You don't send the
accountant your manuscript.

137
00:08:06,815 --> 00:08:10,216
Thanks, but I've already
told Suzie it's not for us.

138
00:08:10,285 --> 00:08:12,082
It's not our
subject matter.

139
00:08:12,154 --> 00:08:14,486
Baby, what's wrong?

140
00:08:14,556 --> 00:08:17,855
MacArthur?

141
00:08:17,926 --> 00:08:21,453
What's wrong with you?
Come here, baby.

142
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:24,124
What is wrong?
Talk to daddy.

143
00:08:27,703 --> 00:08:28,897
Ew!

144
00:08:28,971 --> 00:08:31,269
What did you feed her?

145
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,569
I'm so so sorry
about your dog.

146
00:08:33,642 --> 00:08:37,009
I just scheduled a full body
scan for MacArthur on Monday.

147
00:08:37,079 --> 00:08:39,604
I have the day off Monday
but I'll take her Tuesday.

148
00:08:39,681 --> 00:08:41,148
You'll take her Monday.

149
00:08:41,216 --> 00:08:43,207
I asked for this time
off two months ago.

150
00:08:43,285 --> 00:08:45,378
It's just one day.
I promised my boyfriend

151
00:08:45,454 --> 00:08:47,388
we'd go camping
for his 25th birthday.

152
00:08:47,456 --> 00:08:49,014
It's his 25th birthday?

153
00:08:49,091 --> 00:08:50,285
Yeah, it is.

154
00:08:50,359 --> 00:08:52,554
God, I had no idea.

155
00:08:52,628 --> 00:08:55,153
I'm sorry. Why don't you
take the whole week off?

156
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:56,254
Really?

157
00:08:56,331 --> 00:08:57,696
No!

158
00:08:57,766 --> 00:09:00,667
Okay, no problem.

159
00:09:00,736 --> 00:09:02,795
Come on, things
can't be that bad.

160
00:09:02,871 --> 00:09:05,806
Okay. Let's see what I have
to look forward to in life.

161
00:09:05,874 --> 00:09:07,603
Washing my boss's dog.

162
00:09:07,676 --> 00:09:09,507
Blow-drying my boss's job.

163
00:09:09,578 --> 00:09:10,738
Uh-mm.

164
00:09:10,812 --> 00:09:12,575
Taking my boss's
dog for a CAT scan.

165
00:09:12,648 --> 00:09:14,513
I'm officially
a pathetic loser.

166
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:17,416
Well, at least we still
have Skittles and cigarettes.

167
00:09:20,055 --> 00:09:22,888
Maybe you and Miles
can reschedule the weekend.

168
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:26,450
Oh, yeah. I'll see if Miles
can reschedule his birthday.

169
00:09:26,528 --> 00:09:28,325
No, maybe Jerry's
onto something.

170
00:09:28,397 --> 00:09:31,594
Who needs a significant other
when you're dating your own dog?

171
00:09:31,667 --> 00:09:34,864
Jerry's repulsive. Have you
smelled his breath lately?

172
00:09:34,936 --> 00:09:37,063
He's lucky he can get
a dog to date him.

173
00:09:37,139 --> 00:09:41,075
You know, it's one thing if Jerry is an
undersexed jerk who takes no joy in life

174
00:09:41,143 --> 00:09:44,579
But why does he have to make the
rest of us that way? I hate him!

175
00:09:46,948 --> 00:09:49,644
In my office. Now!

176
00:09:51,553 --> 00:09:55,182
You've got some pretty strong
opinions about my personal choices.

177
00:09:55,257 --> 00:09:57,384
You find my relationship
with MacArthur

178
00:09:57,459 --> 00:09:58,858
something to deride?

179
00:09:58,927 --> 00:10:01,293
Not at all. I respect
your devotion to animals.

180
00:10:01,363 --> 00:10:03,593
You're involvement
with PETA is inspiring.

181
00:10:03,665 --> 00:10:04,791
Don't bullshit me.

182
00:10:04,866 --> 00:10:06,265
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it.

183
00:10:06,335 --> 00:10:08,496
It was childish
and it won't happen again.

184
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:10,367
If you hate me so much,

185
00:10:10,439 --> 00:10:13,931
I don't really think it's healthy
for you to continue working with me.

186
00:10:14,009 --> 00:10:16,000
But, please.
You can't do this.

187
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:17,102
Watch me.

188
00:10:17,179 --> 00:10:18,203
But I need this job.

189
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,304
Here I go.

190
00:10:19,381 --> 00:10:20,405
I support my sister.

191
00:10:20,482 --> 00:10:21,506
You're fired.

192
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:22,607
But I'm...

193
00:10:22,684 --> 00:10:24,549
You're what? You're?

194
00:10:24,619 --> 00:10:25,677
I'm pregnant.

195
00:10:25,754 --> 00:10:26,846
Pregnant?

196
00:10:26,922 --> 00:10:29,288
Yes, pregnant.
Totally pregnant.

197
00:10:29,358 --> 00:10:32,691
The doctor says the chemicals
or hormones or whatever...

198
00:10:32,761 --> 00:10:36,857
are messing up my system and you can't
take anything I say too seriously.

199
00:10:36,932 --> 00:10:39,662
Except for when I say I'm
pregnant because, I am.

200
00:10:47,809 --> 00:10:48,935
Oh, God.

201
00:10:59,087 --> 00:11:00,145
When are you due?

202
00:11:00,222 --> 00:11:02,087
Octember.
I mean, October.

203
00:11:02,157 --> 00:11:03,488
October what?

204
00:11:03,558 --> 00:11:05,526
Uh, probably the 6th.
Could be the 7th,

205
00:11:05,594 --> 00:11:08,188
could be the 8th. But fingers
are crossed for the 6th

206
00:11:08,263 --> 00:11:10,356
by then I'll just want
this thing out of me.

207
00:11:10,432 --> 00:11:12,366
You're almost four
months pregnant?

208
00:11:12,434 --> 00:11:14,265
Yeah.
Isn't that crazy?

209
00:11:14,336 --> 00:11:18,466
Feels like yesterday I wasn't.
But I was because I'm four months

210
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:21,100
The legal department
is backing your story

211
00:11:21,176 --> 00:11:23,906
about not being able
to fire a pregnant woman

212
00:11:23,979 --> 00:11:27,779
no matter how much
she might deserve it.

213
00:11:27,849 --> 00:11:30,340
So get back to work.

214
00:11:30,419 --> 00:11:32,011
Thank you
so much, Jerry.

215
00:11:32,087 --> 00:11:35,648
I really appreciate it.
Thank you. From both of us.

216
00:11:40,295 --> 00:11:44,732
Congratulations on the baby. The
entire legal department is thrilled.

217
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,201
Hey, why didn't you tell
me earlier? Oh, I know.

218
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:51,364
Probably because there's so
much that can go horribly wrong.

219
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,671
I mean, I'm out of the woods.
But I do everything right.

220
00:11:54,743 --> 00:11:58,008
Anyway, so I'm having my baby
first, not that it's a competition.

221
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,842
But I win!

222
00:11:59,915 --> 00:12:02,782
Anyway, no, really,
congratulations.

223
00:12:02,851 --> 00:12:05,820
Oh, Thea! Oh, I'm so excited for you.

224
00:12:05,887 --> 00:12:08,378
No wonder you've
been spacey lately.

225
00:12:08,457 --> 00:12:09,719
What's going on?

226
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:11,691
Everybody, Thea's pregnant!

227
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,660
Don't look at me.
I never touched her.

228
00:12:13,728 --> 00:12:16,526
Never would have guessed.
You still look sexy.

229
00:12:16,598 --> 00:12:19,362
I had to tell everyone.
Couldn't keep it a secret.

230
00:12:19,434 --> 00:12:22,665
Of course. How can you
hide that kind of thing?

231
00:12:22,737 --> 00:12:26,503
I should've known. My left knee's
been hurting. When my knee hurts,

232
00:12:26,575 --> 00:12:28,543
it usually means
someone's pregnant.

233
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:32,512
Yeah, or they're stuck underwater
in a car. Anyway, I'm glad it's this.

234
00:12:32,581 --> 00:12:35,141
So who's
the very lucky fella?

235
00:12:35,217 --> 00:12:37,651
You didn't tell 'em
the rest of the news?

236
00:12:37,719 --> 00:12:39,482
Thea and Miles
are engaged!

237
00:12:39,554 --> 00:12:42,250
Oh!

238
00:12:42,324 --> 00:12:44,884
That's so great!

239
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:49,454
I mean, I got married before I got
pregnant, but better late than never.

240
00:12:49,531 --> 00:12:51,021
Whoo-hoo!
Yay for you!

241
00:12:51,099 --> 00:12:53,260
Yeah, I'm, I'm really
excited, everyone.

242
00:12:53,335 --> 00:12:56,702
Yeah, thrilled. Over
the moon. Way over it!

243
00:12:59,641 --> 00:13:00,835
Psst.

244
00:13:06,515 --> 00:13:08,676
Pregnant? It's brilliant.

245
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,377
Where did you
come up with that?

246
00:13:10,452 --> 00:13:13,148
I saw it on an episode
of Law and Order.

247
00:13:13,221 --> 00:13:15,212
Yeah. You can't fire
a pregnant woman.

248
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:17,884
Discrimination, lawsuits,
bad mojo, whatever.

249
00:13:17,959 --> 00:13:20,359
Smart.

250
00:13:20,428 --> 00:13:22,055
By the way,
thanks for your help.

251
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:24,655
Pregnant wasn't bad enough.
I had to get engaged.

252
00:13:24,733 --> 00:13:28,328
Well, I didn't want people to think
you were some kind of wayward skank.

253
00:13:28,403 --> 00:13:30,462
Is that what you
think of single mothers?

254
00:13:30,539 --> 00:13:34,100
No, of course not. I just happen to
know that a lot of people in the office

255
00:13:34,175 --> 00:13:37,633
think you're a wayward skank and I
thought this could turn it around.

256
00:13:37,712 --> 00:13:41,409
Thanks. Crap, Lisa. What am I gonna
do? How will I get out of this?

257
00:13:41,483 --> 00:13:44,884
Can't we just say that you
know, something happened to,

258
00:13:44,953 --> 00:13:48,787
I don't know, one
of your tubes. Sprung a leak.

259
00:13:48,857 --> 00:13:50,825
Do you know what
you're talking about?

260
00:13:50,892 --> 00:13:53,156
Let's just go along with
it for a little while

261
00:13:53,228 --> 00:13:55,162
and then we'll say
it was a false alarm.

262
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:58,722
You thought you were pregnant, but
it turns out you just had crabs.

263
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,960
Ew.

264
00:14:07,142 --> 00:14:09,940
I'm so sorry, Em. I had
a crazy day at work

265
00:14:10,011 --> 00:14:12,809
and I lost track of time.
Am I too late?

266
00:14:12,881 --> 00:14:16,749
The meeting was at four and it's
five o'clock now. You do the math.

267
00:14:16,818 --> 00:14:18,718
I'm really sorry.

268
00:14:20,789 --> 00:14:22,051
Have you been drinking?

269
00:14:22,123 --> 00:14:23,988
I had a cocktail.

270
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,957
Come on. You're 17. You should
be out drinking and smoking

271
00:14:34,736 --> 00:14:38,035
I'll reschedule with your
guidance counselor next week.

272
00:14:38,106 --> 00:14:41,701
Don't bother. I already met with Miss
Talbot and we discussed my options

273
00:14:41,776 --> 00:14:43,903
What options?

274
00:14:43,979 --> 00:14:47,380
She suggested I start taking
some cooking classes after school.

275
00:14:47,449 --> 00:14:50,043
You have
tennis after school.

276
00:14:50,118 --> 00:14:52,416
Yeah, but I'm
sick of tennis.

277
00:14:52,487 --> 00:14:56,924
I was thinking maybe I could go to the
Culinary Institute in San Francisco.

278
00:14:56,992 --> 00:14:59,586
No way. You're staying
right here and going to UCLA.

279
00:14:59,661 --> 00:15:03,654
Tennis will cover the tuition and I'm
busting my ass off to cover the rest.

280
00:15:03,732 --> 00:15:07,725
I know. You keep telling me when Mom
and Dad died, we lost out on options.

281
00:15:07,802 --> 00:15:11,898
Just do me a favor, be a grown-up and
accept the hand that you've been dealt.

282
00:15:11,973 --> 00:15:13,440
So that's
what you do?

283
00:15:13,508 --> 00:15:15,339
Yeah, that's
what I do.

284
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:19,744
Really? 'Cause you were at a bar
instead of my parent teacher conference.

285
00:15:28,323 --> 00:15:30,621
Oh, hello, Mr. Abbott.

286
00:15:30,692 --> 00:15:33,388
Jerry? Jerry,
where are you?

287
00:15:33,461 --> 00:15:34,860
Mr. Abbott,
can I help you?

288
00:15:34,929 --> 00:15:37,329
Is there anything
to drink in this place

289
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:39,799
or do I have to go to my
car and get my divining rod?

290
00:15:39,868 --> 00:15:41,597
I could get you
some water.

291
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:45,037
Go ahead, soldier. Three
parts scotch, one part water.

292
00:15:45,106 --> 00:15:47,040
Okay. Move, move,
move. Hey, soldier.

293
00:15:47,108 --> 00:15:48,666
What brings
you to the office?

294
00:15:48,743 --> 00:15:51,837
How are you? Well, your
brother wants my book.

295
00:15:51,913 --> 00:15:54,939
Jerry's at lunch. But Thea can
take your manuscript for you

296
00:15:55,016 --> 00:15:56,540
Who's Thea?

297
00:15:56,618 --> 00:15:59,052
Jerry's secretary. You
talk to her every day.

298
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,216
Congratulations are probably in order.
Thea has good news. She's having a baby

299
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:04,553
Hm.

300
00:16:04,626 --> 00:16:07,060
She looks like
she's strong stock.

301
00:16:07,128 --> 00:16:12,031
Maybe she can give us
a strong future Marine.

302
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,863
Thea, do you
have a minute?

303
00:16:13,935 --> 00:16:15,425
So, uh, how are you?

304
00:16:15,503 --> 00:16:17,494
Fine, thanks. You?

305
00:16:17,572 --> 00:16:22,566
Oh, I'm fine. But I'm not the one with a
magical bundle of joy growing inside of me.

306
00:16:22,644 --> 00:16:25,636
So, no morning sickness?
No bloating?

307
00:16:25,714 --> 00:16:28,512
No. Nuh-unh. Guess
I'm just really lucky.

308
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:30,278
A little too lucky,
if you ask me.

309
00:16:30,351 --> 00:16:31,443
Yeah.

310
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,919
And uh, where
is your ring?

311
00:16:33,988 --> 00:16:36,320
Well, we...

312
00:16:36,391 --> 00:16:38,951
Her fianceé is saving
up for her ring.

313
00:16:39,027 --> 00:16:41,621
It's not very nice to
try to embarrass people.

314
00:16:41,696 --> 00:16:45,359
So why don't you get back to lying
about yourself on your dating websites?

315
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:52,306
Don't worry about him. He doesn't
know anything. He's an idiot.

316
00:16:52,373 --> 00:16:54,307
And I'm sure Greg
is still a virgin.

317
00:16:56,611 --> 00:16:58,044
Come on, Jerry.

318
00:16:58,113 --> 00:16:59,603
Oh! Alright, Jerry.

319
00:16:59,681 --> 00:17:00,909
Oh! Watch it!

320
00:17:00,982 --> 00:17:02,108
Dumbass.

321
00:17:02,183 --> 00:17:04,310
Come on, Nick.

322
00:17:04,385 --> 00:17:06,216
Come on Nick,
you can do it.

323
00:17:14,996 --> 00:17:16,088
Hit it!

324
00:17:16,164 --> 00:17:17,358
Ow!

325
00:17:17,432 --> 00:17:19,423
Ball. Take your base.

326
00:17:19,501 --> 00:17:20,798
Take your base!

327
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:23,064
Come on, Thea.

328
00:17:23,138 --> 00:17:24,196
Come on, Thea!

329
00:17:24,272 --> 00:17:25,569
Let's go, Thea!

330
00:17:26,775 --> 00:17:28,299
Go, go. Home run.

331
00:17:28,376 --> 00:17:29,707
Come on, come on.

332
00:17:29,778 --> 00:17:31,837
Go, go.
Get home, get home.

333
00:17:33,815 --> 00:17:35,476
Come on, come on.

334
00:17:37,285 --> 00:17:38,616
Safe!

335
00:17:41,289 --> 00:17:42,347
Are you okay?

336
00:17:42,423 --> 00:17:43,583
Yeah. I'm great.

337
00:17:45,393 --> 00:17:48,089
Come on, Colonel.
You can do it.

338
00:17:48,163 --> 00:17:49,289
You got it!

339
00:17:49,364 --> 00:17:50,353
Great.

340
00:17:50,431 --> 00:17:51,489
Thea.

341
00:17:51,566 --> 00:17:54,433
Kristen. Come
here, please now.

342
00:17:54,502 --> 00:17:58,563
You shouldn't be playing
in your condition.

343
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,766
What condition?

344
00:17:59,841 --> 00:18:01,433
Your baby.

345
00:18:01,509 --> 00:18:03,477
Lisa, get your
ass out on base?

346
00:18:03,545 --> 00:18:04,739
Of course.

347
00:18:04,813 --> 00:18:06,906
We are taking you
out. For the season.

348
00:18:08,183 --> 00:18:10,583
All season.

349
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,988
Come on!

350
00:18:15,056 --> 00:18:16,489
Hey, thanks
for the RBI.

351
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:18,617
Yeah, well,
no more RBIs.

352
00:18:18,693 --> 00:18:22,322
Jerry says I'm a liability, so
I can't play 'cause I'm pregnant.

353
00:18:22,397 --> 00:18:25,389
Sounds like the most reasonable
opinion he's had in years.

354
00:18:26,434 --> 00:18:28,231
Oh!

355
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:36,934
Yes!

356
00:18:48,623 --> 00:18:50,090
MacArthur?

357
00:18:50,158 --> 00:18:51,591
Good heavens.

358
00:18:51,659 --> 00:18:54,787
Oh, it's okay. I'm
coming for you, baby.

359
00:19:04,205 --> 00:19:06,070
I need a copy
of Abbott's manuscript.

360
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:09,075
I'm gonna read it in the car
on the way to his funeral.

361
00:19:09,143 --> 00:19:12,010
What? You've never seen a
manuscript on napkins before?

362
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,878
When genius strikes, you
write it down. Do it now.

363
00:19:14,949 --> 00:19:16,177
Okay.

364
00:19:20,388 --> 00:19:24,415
Oh. Thea, um, should you
still be using the copier?

365
00:19:24,492 --> 00:19:27,290
Copy machines emit
electro magnetic waves.

366
00:19:27,362 --> 00:19:29,057
And what does that do?

367
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:32,429
Well, no one knows yet. But I've
been reading on the message boards

368
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:36,596
and it seems like something you should avoid
if you're trying to have a well pregnancy.

369
00:19:36,671 --> 00:19:38,195
I think I should be okay.

370
00:19:38,273 --> 00:19:41,868
Oh, good. Well, if it
doesn't bother you,

371
00:19:41,943 --> 00:19:44,138
then can you make 50
copies of that for me?

372
00:19:44,212 --> 00:19:45,873
Thank you.

373
00:19:48,316 --> 00:19:50,011
You know, I,
I find it fascinating

374
00:19:50,084 --> 00:19:52,609
that Kristen is only a
month further along than you

375
00:19:52,687 --> 00:19:56,418
and yet she's the size of a school bus
and you're still the size of Kate Moss.

376
00:19:56,491 --> 00:19:58,982
Different strokes,
I guess.

377
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:03,156
Perhaps it's easier to feel
the bump than to see it.

378
00:20:03,231 --> 00:20:06,689
What's the big deal? Everyone
likes to touch a pregnant stomach.

379
00:20:06,768 --> 00:20:08,963
Because you're
a gross weirdo, Greg.

380
00:20:10,772 --> 00:20:13,741
And the baby doesn't
like gross weirdos, Greg.

381
00:20:15,043 --> 00:20:16,476
Hmpf.

382
00:20:16,544 --> 00:20:18,671
You and me are going
shopping after work.

383
00:20:30,892 --> 00:20:32,792
What on earth
are you doing?

384
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,225
I'm stealing
you a belly.

385
00:20:34,295 --> 00:20:35,353
What?

386
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:36,897
You're four
months pregnant

387
00:20:36,965 --> 00:20:39,365
and you've got the abs
of a Jenku swimsuit model.

388
00:20:39,434 --> 00:20:40,958
Sh. Cover me. Okay?

389
00:20:41,035 --> 00:20:43,731
Look. If you want people
to think you're pregnant,

390
00:20:43,805 --> 00:20:47,935
you've gotta start talking the
talk and walking the... waddle

391
00:20:50,411 --> 00:20:51,901
I don't know
if I can do this.

392
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:54,107
You can do this.
Just do it for a week.

393
00:20:54,182 --> 00:20:57,879
But you've gotta look the part or
people are gonna get suspicious.

394
00:20:57,952 --> 00:21:00,386
I look ridiculous.

395
00:21:00,455 --> 00:21:02,719
These jeans
are elastic on the top.

396
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:05,088
I feel like I'm wearing
a condom on my stomach.

397
00:21:05,159 --> 00:21:09,027
You don't look like you've
been anywhere near a condom.

398
00:21:09,097 --> 00:21:13,796
Gross. Did you know that when women
are in labor they sometimes poop?

399
00:21:13,868 --> 00:21:15,358
Ew.

400
00:21:15,436 --> 00:21:19,202
Have you ever heard of an
episiotomy? Or cankles? Hmm?

401
00:21:19,273 --> 00:21:20,501
Agh.

402
00:21:20,575 --> 00:21:23,567
Well, we should get
this as a reference.

403
00:21:23,644 --> 00:21:26,613
I thought this whole thing was
gonna blow over in a few days.

404
00:21:26,681 --> 00:21:30,310
Yeah, but until then you should know
the ins and outs of being preggers.

405
00:21:30,385 --> 00:21:33,411
There's a whole world of stuff
here you know nothing about.

406
00:21:33,488 --> 00:21:36,252
Yeah. And I'd kind of
like to keep it that way.

407
00:21:36,324 --> 00:21:38,724
Ew. Look
at those nipples.

408
00:21:38,793 --> 00:21:40,260
Wait a second,
wait a second.

409
00:21:40,328 --> 00:21:41,352
What?

410
00:21:41,429 --> 00:21:42,760
Here. Here.

411
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:44,923
No. Can I keep
the stomach at your house?

412
00:21:44,999 --> 00:21:47,263
No. That's like keeping
your arm at my house.

413
00:21:47,335 --> 00:21:50,498
No, no. I don't want Emma to
find out and she hates when I lie.

414
00:21:50,571 --> 00:21:51,595
You lie all the time.

415
00:21:51,672 --> 00:21:52,866
No, really.

416
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:55,306
It stays with you.
It's your stomach.

417
00:22:07,121 --> 00:22:08,679
Hey! Can I get
a little privacy?

418
00:22:08,756 --> 00:22:11,384
Whoa, what are you doing in
there? Can I just come in?

419
00:22:11,459 --> 00:22:13,051
I'm trying
to talk to you.

420
00:22:13,127 --> 00:22:16,096
It doesn't matter what I'm
doing right now, I am busy. Shoo.

421
00:22:19,133 --> 00:22:21,431
Morning, Thea,
you got my check?

422
00:22:21,502 --> 00:22:25,131
Wow. Look at you.

423
00:22:25,206 --> 00:22:28,198
Yeah, look at me.
Oh, it's not what, um...

424
00:22:28,276 --> 00:22:31,211
Oh, geez, I mean. You've
obviously got a lot on your plate.

425
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:34,510
I'm sorry about the other day.
Don't worry about the rent check.

426
00:22:34,582 --> 00:22:36,550
Take another
week or two.

427
00:22:36,617 --> 00:22:38,244
You just take
care of yourself.

428
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:40,651
Oh, my God.

429
00:22:40,721 --> 00:22:43,815
Oh, how
exciting.

430
00:22:43,891 --> 00:22:45,859
I have so much baby
stuff I can lend you.

431
00:22:45,927 --> 00:22:48,452
Let me know if you need to
borrow my old breast pump.

432
00:22:48,529 --> 00:22:49,689
I just have
to rinse it.

433
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:12,019
My favorite lubricant,
Ann? WD-40.

434
00:23:12,086 --> 00:23:15,988
Thea. I've made some brownies
for you to fatten you up.

435
00:23:16,057 --> 00:23:17,081
Oh, thank you.

436
00:23:17,158 --> 00:23:18,386
It popped.

437
00:23:18,459 --> 00:23:20,450
Yeah, once you pop,
you can't stop.

438
00:23:20,528 --> 00:23:23,429
You're carrying low.
It's definitely a boy.

439
00:23:23,498 --> 00:23:27,229
Whatever it is, you've obviously
begun that slippery slide into obesity.

440
00:23:27,301 --> 00:23:30,168
Well, you had a nice run
there, didn't you, champ?

441
00:23:30,238 --> 00:23:32,763
Oh, good morning.

442
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,831
Look at you.

443
00:23:34,909 --> 00:23:37,503
Oh, my God. I think
I just felt it kick.

444
00:23:37,578 --> 00:23:40,570
Oh. Yeah, mark it in the
baby journal for me, will you?

445
00:23:40,648 --> 00:23:41,808
I will.

446
00:23:41,883 --> 00:23:43,180
Are people buying it?

447
00:23:43,251 --> 00:23:45,742
Totally. Totally.
Ann made me brownies.

448
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,811
I got a seat
on the bus today.

449
00:23:47,889 --> 00:23:49,982
And Garth is not
attracted to me anymore.

450
00:23:50,057 --> 00:23:52,048
It's the best morning
I've had in years.

451
00:23:52,126 --> 00:23:54,788
Okay, you want to hear
something even more amazing?

452
00:23:54,862 --> 00:23:56,989
Have you read Abbott's
new manuscript?

453
00:23:57,064 --> 00:23:58,827
I get asked
to Xerox, not to read.

454
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:01,892
Okay. Get ready
to have your mind blown.

455
00:24:01,969 --> 00:24:05,427
Ah, "Philip of Macedon
had a hard-on. "

456
00:24:05,506 --> 00:24:08,168
"Scaled great peaks
to conquer the Greeks. "

457
00:24:08,242 --> 00:24:10,710
It's all rhyming couplets
and dirty limericks.

458
00:24:10,778 --> 00:24:13,076
And this is what Jerry's
betting the bank on.

459
00:24:14,048 --> 00:24:15,515
It's insane.

460
00:24:15,583 --> 00:24:16,777
Oh, you're welcome.

461
00:24:20,588 --> 00:24:22,351
Well, you
look different.

462
00:24:22,423 --> 00:24:25,290
Sorry. I'll move you to the
shitty corner in a second.

463
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:28,385
It's all right, dear.
You've got your hands full.

464
00:24:28,462 --> 00:24:30,657
You've exploded.

465
00:24:30,731 --> 00:24:31,789
Well, yes, she has.

466
00:24:35,903 --> 00:24:38,463
Well, people. I'm sure
you'll be relieved to hear

467
00:24:38,539 --> 00:24:42,134
that MacArthur is expected
to make a full recovery.

468
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:43,871
I've gotten her a spot

469
00:24:43,945 --> 00:24:47,346
at the McElroy Center for Veterinary
Rehabilitation in Bethesda.

470
00:24:47,415 --> 00:24:49,246
It's the best in the country.

471
00:24:49,317 --> 00:24:52,980
They tell me she should be at 90
percent tail-wagging capability

472
00:24:53,054 --> 00:24:54,316
after just six weeks.

473
00:24:54,388 --> 00:24:56,379
I'll be out of
the office for a while.

474
00:24:56,457 --> 00:24:58,982
I'll be working out of the
rehab center in Bethesda

475
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:02,188
where I've taken a room for the
duration of MacArthur's stay.

476
00:25:02,263 --> 00:25:05,721
Until I get back, Nicky will
be holding down the fort.

477
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,928
I'm giving him strict instructions
not to do anything stupid.

478
00:25:09,003 --> 00:25:10,732
Code red.

479
00:25:10,805 --> 00:25:13,069
Seriously, Nick.

480
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:15,005
Don't blow it.

481
00:25:17,178 --> 00:25:18,770
Check it out.

482
00:25:18,846 --> 00:25:21,940
There's our fearless leader
plotting our brilliant future.

483
00:25:22,016 --> 00:25:25,315
Well at least with him in
charge, I'm off the hook.

484
00:25:25,386 --> 00:25:27,581
Well, things
are looking up.

485
00:25:27,655 --> 00:25:30,249
Okay, let's figure out how
to get me out of this mess.

486
00:25:30,324 --> 00:25:33,953
I'll Google what kind of mishaps
can happen when you're pregnant.

487
00:25:34,028 --> 00:25:36,019
Hi, guys. Sorry
to bother you.

488
00:25:36,097 --> 00:25:39,533
You're boss now, Nick. You
can bother us anytime you want.

489
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:45,300
Right. Um, Thea, I kind of need
a favor. Would you, come with me?

490
00:25:48,242 --> 00:25:49,869
We're meeting
Suzie Cavendish.

491
00:25:49,944 --> 00:25:52,276
I mentioned her in
the meeting last week.

492
00:25:52,346 --> 00:25:55,372
You see, Suzie's written
this hilarious book

493
00:25:55,449 --> 00:25:58,816
about pregnancy. It, it's true
stories about pregnant women

494
00:25:58,886 --> 00:26:02,879
getting stuck in bathtubs and
throwing up under their desks at work

495
00:26:02,957 --> 00:26:05,721
and farting
by mistake in meetings.

496
00:26:05,793 --> 00:26:09,354
It, it's stuff you, you must know
a lot more about than me, obviously.

497
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:11,489
Yeah, totally. Totally.

498
00:26:11,565 --> 00:26:14,898
I'm trying really, really
hard not to fart right now.

499
00:26:14,969 --> 00:26:18,302
Anyway, I want
to publish Suzie's book

500
00:26:18,372 --> 00:26:21,307
and, and while Jerry's
gone, I'm gonna do it.

501
00:26:21,375 --> 00:26:23,639
You know, carpe diem
and all that stuff.

502
00:26:23,711 --> 00:26:25,406
Yeah, definitely.

503
00:26:25,479 --> 00:26:29,438
I actually used to be a pretty
carpe diem kind of person myself.

504
00:26:29,517 --> 00:26:30,711
But not anymore.

505
00:26:30,785 --> 00:26:32,013
Because I'm pregnant.

506
00:26:32,086 --> 00:26:33,815
See, that's just it.

507
00:26:33,888 --> 00:26:36,823
Suzie's not convinced that
Steinwald's the right place.

508
00:26:36,891 --> 00:26:40,190
So I thought you might
help convince her otherwise.

509
00:26:40,261 --> 00:26:41,853
Yeah, sure.

510
00:26:41,929 --> 00:26:45,262
I mean, I'll just talk to her
about the whole farting thing.

511
00:26:47,868 --> 00:26:50,701
Uh, one thing. Uh, Suzie kind
of thinks you're an editor.

512
00:26:50,771 --> 00:26:52,329
Why would
she think that?

513
00:26:52,406 --> 00:26:53,930
I kind of implied it.

514
00:26:54,008 --> 00:26:55,032
What?

515
00:26:55,109 --> 00:26:56,133
Suzie!

516
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:58,678
Hi. Nice to see you.

517
00:26:58,746 --> 00:27:02,682
Most pregnancy books make
you feel totally inadequate

518
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:05,275
and how you're destined to
be a failure as a parent.

519
00:27:05,353 --> 00:27:07,913
No one writes about what
pregnancy is really like,

520
00:27:07,988 --> 00:27:10,456
how you feel fat and clumsy and stupid.

521
00:27:10,524 --> 00:27:12,424
The absolute worst

522
00:27:12,493 --> 00:27:16,190
is "What to Expect When You're
Expecting. " Have you read that?

523
00:27:16,263 --> 00:27:20,893
Oh, no, I was told it was so
bad I shouldn't even go near it.

524
00:27:20,968 --> 00:27:22,765
So, what are you reading?

525
00:27:22,837 --> 00:27:25,328
Uh,

526
00:27:25,406 --> 00:27:28,375
You know, just
the usual suspects.

527
00:27:28,442 --> 00:27:29,932
Like?

528
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:34,276
Well, I was banking on
finding Pregnancy for Dummies.

529
00:27:34,348 --> 00:27:36,908
I love
that series. Yeah.

530
00:27:36,984 --> 00:27:39,248
Hm. Interesting.

531
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,515
Come on, Nicky, how can
you guys sell my book

532
00:27:41,589 --> 00:27:43,955
if you're not familiar
with the competition?

533
00:27:44,024 --> 00:27:46,424
Thea has had a pretty
full workload lately.

534
00:27:46,494 --> 00:27:50,294
I don't know, guys. I don't know
if this is the right marriage.

535
00:27:50,364 --> 00:27:53,697
Come on. From the people who
brought you the Kalashnikov diaries

536
00:27:53,768 --> 00:27:57,260
comes a comedic send-up
of 21st century pregnancy?

537
00:27:57,338 --> 00:28:00,273
It's just, the right
home is so important.

538
00:28:00,341 --> 00:28:01,933
I know. We are
the right home.

539
00:28:02,009 --> 00:28:06,139
I mean, sure, our, uh,
plumbing is a little leaky

540
00:28:06,213 --> 00:28:08,613
and maybe we need
a new paint job.

541
00:28:08,682 --> 00:28:12,778
But our backyard is a really great
place for a barbecue in the summer.

542
00:28:12,853 --> 00:28:16,220
You know?

543
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:21,023
If we can make a bestseller out of the "Defeat
of Darius at Issus" we've gotta be good.

544
00:28:21,095 --> 00:28:23,029
I mean, that couldn't
be easy, right?

545
00:28:23,097 --> 00:28:24,826
Absolutely.

546
00:28:24,899 --> 00:28:27,561
The thing about pregnancy
is it's incredibly messy.

547
00:28:27,635 --> 00:28:30,536
Those other books are teaching
you how to avoid the mess.

548
00:28:30,604 --> 00:28:32,037
You're embracing the mess.

549
00:28:32,106 --> 00:28:35,132
And you've written
an incredible insightful,

550
00:28:35,209 --> 00:28:39,202
hilarious,
controversial manifesto.

551
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:42,215
Just give us a shot. It has
bestseller written all over it.

552
00:28:42,283 --> 00:28:44,148
We promise we
won't let you down.

553
00:28:46,587 --> 00:28:47,713
So you've read it.

554
00:28:47,788 --> 00:28:50,052
Oh. I live it.
Love it. Every day.

555
00:28:51,959 --> 00:28:54,655
Let me think about it.

556
00:28:54,728 --> 00:28:57,219
Hey, I'm starting a new
birthing class tomorrow.

557
00:28:57,298 --> 00:28:58,856
Maybe Thea could
come with me.

558
00:28:58,933 --> 00:29:00,230
She'll be there.

559
00:29:00,301 --> 00:29:01,962
And bring your partner.

560
00:29:02,036 --> 00:29:05,199
Her fiancee. Miles, right?

561
00:29:05,272 --> 00:29:08,298
Yeah. Could you excuse
me for a second?

562
00:29:08,375 --> 00:29:09,569
Yes.

563
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:18,445
Vodka. Straight up.

564
00:29:24,158 --> 00:29:25,819
Thanks.

565
00:29:34,001 --> 00:29:35,593
You okay?

566
00:29:35,669 --> 00:29:38,001
I just set the world
record for bullshitting.

567
00:29:38,072 --> 00:29:39,596
What happened?

568
00:29:39,673 --> 00:29:42,164
Long story. I can't
handle doing it again.

569
00:29:43,811 --> 00:29:44,903
A promotion?

570
00:29:44,979 --> 00:29:47,277
You are the new
Associate Editor

571
00:29:47,348 --> 00:29:49,111
of our brand
new Family division.

572
00:29:49,183 --> 00:29:50,844
Family division?

573
00:29:50,918 --> 00:29:53,785
Suzie called. She wants to
give us a shot, thanks to you.

574
00:29:53,854 --> 00:29:56,254
Now, Suzie's book will
launch our new division.

575
00:29:56,323 --> 00:29:59,224
It's a perfect opportunity
to capture a new demographic

576
00:29:59,293 --> 00:30:01,488
and help the company
to grow vertically...

577
00:30:01,562 --> 00:30:03,120
Nick.

578
00:30:03,197 --> 00:30:05,893
Look, there's something
I need to tell you.

579
00:30:05,966 --> 00:30:07,433
This whole thing
is a big lie.

580
00:30:07,501 --> 00:30:09,799
I feel terrible,
but I'm not really...

581
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:11,599
An editor?

582
00:30:11,672 --> 00:30:14,038
I know, I'm the one
who forced you to lie.

583
00:30:14,108 --> 00:30:18,477
Which as a rule isn't great but what's not
a lie is that you did really good today.

584
00:30:18,546 --> 00:30:20,571
There's so many
people more qualified.

585
00:30:20,648 --> 00:30:23,640
So many people in ways
you don't even know.

586
00:30:23,717 --> 00:30:28,120
Thea. To be a good editor all you
need is a, a feel for the material

587
00:30:28,188 --> 00:30:30,782
It's what my father had
when he started this company

588
00:30:30,858 --> 00:30:32,689
and it's
what you have.

589
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:36,218
You're living through the
thrills of starting a family.

590
00:30:36,297 --> 00:30:38,629
What about Kristen?
She's pregnant.

591
00:30:38,699 --> 00:30:41,998
Obviously I am too, but
she's, she's really pregnant.

592
00:30:42,069 --> 00:30:46,506
First of all, Kristen's a lawyer
without a creative bone in her body.

593
00:30:46,574 --> 00:30:51,170
And then there's the indisputable
fact that she's a complete weirdo.

594
00:30:51,245 --> 00:30:55,306
Oh. Look, Nick,
I mean, I see your point.

595
00:30:55,382 --> 00:30:57,577
I do. And I wanna help.

596
00:30:57,651 --> 00:31:00,586
But I just, I can't.

597
00:31:00,654 --> 00:31:02,679
I'm not your accountant.

598
00:31:02,756 --> 00:31:05,054
But the other thing
you should know is that

599
00:31:05,125 --> 00:31:08,891
associate editors make a lot
more money than secretaries.

600
00:31:08,963 --> 00:31:10,055
A lot?

601
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:11,757
Let's just say,

602
00:31:11,832 --> 00:31:14,027
you'll have your own
secretary and office.

603
00:31:14,101 --> 00:31:17,036
So are you my new
associate editor?

604
00:31:17,104 --> 00:31:19,629
I guess I am.

605
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:25,938
"War Stories From the Pregnancy
Front" by Suzie Cavendish.

606
00:31:26,013 --> 00:31:28,982
You loved it,
you live it.

607
00:31:29,049 --> 00:31:30,641
You should
probably read it.

608
00:31:30,718 --> 00:31:33,380
I do, I agree with
what you're saying.

609
00:31:33,454 --> 00:31:36,252
If you have your colon
health you do have everything.

610
00:31:36,323 --> 00:31:40,157
But, I do, I thought it interesting
when you said we were going wrong

611
00:31:40,227 --> 00:31:45,961
and we should be sort of on the seat like
a gargoyle as opposed to just sitting.

612
00:31:46,033 --> 00:31:49,025
Not now, Miles.

613
00:31:49,103 --> 00:31:53,005
Don't you know enough about
being fake pregnant already?

614
00:31:53,073 --> 00:31:56,565
How can this be this
big of a deal?

615
00:31:56,644 --> 00:32:00,307
I mean, come on, you do the
nasty, you're knocked up,

616
00:32:00,381 --> 00:32:04,283
you inflate and then, uh, eight,
nine months? Nine months later

617
00:32:04,351 --> 00:32:08,515
you shoot that puppy out. I mean, how
can there be 8 million books about this?

618
00:32:08,589 --> 00:32:10,682
Just promise me
you won't write one.

619
00:32:10,758 --> 00:32:14,159
Okay. If you promise you're
still on birth control.

620
00:32:14,228 --> 00:32:16,025
Believe me, I am.

621
00:32:16,096 --> 00:32:17,290
Oh, yeah?

622
00:32:17,364 --> 00:32:18,388
Uh-huh.

623
00:32:18,465 --> 00:32:19,557
Excellent.

624
00:32:44,058 --> 00:32:45,355
Nice new digs, huh?

625
00:32:45,426 --> 00:32:46,484
Yeah.

626
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,027
So, what did you think?

627
00:32:48,095 --> 00:32:49,289
About what?

628
00:32:49,363 --> 00:32:51,194
Uh, Suzie's book.
Any thoughts?

629
00:32:52,833 --> 00:32:55,529
Oh, yeah, it was great.

630
00:32:55,602 --> 00:32:57,433
What do you think?

631
00:32:57,504 --> 00:33:00,132
How much did
you actually read?

632
00:33:00,207 --> 00:33:02,539
The first two chapters.

633
00:33:02,609 --> 00:33:06,238
But I'm gonna finish the rest of it
today. I just got a little distracted.

634
00:33:06,313 --> 00:33:08,008
Nick, please,
let me explain.

635
00:33:08,082 --> 00:33:10,141
Thanks for your thoughts.

636
00:33:10,217 --> 00:33:15,211
You have
shelves. And a door.

637
00:33:17,324 --> 00:33:19,918
Congratulations, Thea.

638
00:33:19,993 --> 00:33:22,018
Thank you, Greg.

639
00:33:25,232 --> 00:33:28,531
You really think you can get to
the top by playing games, don't ya?

640
00:33:28,602 --> 00:33:31,901
I know what you're up to, Thea.
And I think that it stinks.

641
00:33:31,972 --> 00:33:34,440
Hm.

642
00:33:34,508 --> 00:33:38,308
Really? Do you think that it stinks that
I want to hire you to be my Assistant?

643
00:33:38,378 --> 00:33:40,312
Really?

644
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:43,747
You'll start first thing Monday
after I put the paperwork through.

645
00:33:43,817 --> 00:33:47,514
Oh, wow, Thea. Thea, thank you so
much. I, I could kiss you right now.

646
00:33:47,588 --> 00:33:49,021
You don't have
to do that.

647
00:33:49,089 --> 00:33:50,420
I'll see you later, boss.

648
00:33:50,491 --> 00:33:52,482
Look at you,
Little Miss Executive.

649
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:55,255
Hardly. I don't even really
know what I'm doing here.

650
00:33:55,329 --> 00:33:57,889
I didn't finish the
manuscript last night and Nick

651
00:33:57,965 --> 00:34:00,331
just asked for my opinion
and I didn't have one.

652
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:06,498
You might wanna get one. This is your
ticket out of the secretarial pool.

653
00:34:20,754 --> 00:34:23,780
If your last name is O'Keeffe,
why do you look Jewish?

654
00:34:23,857 --> 00:34:27,850
Well, it's true.
You don't look Irish.

655
00:34:45,012 --> 00:34:46,377
Steinwald Publishing.

656
00:34:55,189 --> 00:34:58,647
So O'Keeffe got a new girlfriend.
He's robbing the cradle.

657
00:34:58,725 --> 00:35:00,317
She's 95.

658
00:35:04,131 --> 00:35:05,655
Did you hear me?

659
00:35:09,002 --> 00:35:11,027
I loved it. It
was funny and smart

660
00:35:11,104 --> 00:35:13,572
and you don't even have
to be pregnant to enjoy it.

661
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:16,040
I'm guessing about that
because I am pregnant.

662
00:35:16,109 --> 00:35:17,974
I enjoyed it and I'm
not pregnant.

663
00:35:18,045 --> 00:35:21,446
I was thinking, you could organize
the chapters like a pregnancy.

664
00:35:21,515 --> 00:35:24,245
You know, group each
woman's stories by trimester.

665
00:35:24,318 --> 00:35:27,719
So, so the book would start with
stories about the awkward moments

666
00:35:27,788 --> 00:35:30,780
when everyone thinks you've
been eating too many cupcakes.

667
00:35:30,858 --> 00:35:32,917
Exactly. And then
the second trimester.

668
00:35:32,993 --> 00:35:36,326
Like Sally's story when she threw
up in her purse at her kid's play.

669
00:35:36,396 --> 00:35:40,127
Nick, I'm sorry I didn't finish the
book last night. It won't happen again.

670
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,963
I'm glad you like it.

671
00:35:42,035 --> 00:35:45,334
We've got our work cut out for us.
It'll be in bookstores in 6 weeks.

672
00:35:45,405 --> 00:35:50,741
I'd like to see your notes, but Suzie's
class starts in 20 minutes so you should go.

673
00:35:50,811 --> 00:35:56,113
I totally forgot. The thing is, Miles
is, is going out of town for work.

674
00:35:56,183 --> 00:35:57,275
That's too bad.

675
00:35:57,351 --> 00:35:58,978
Do you think
I could reschedule?

676
00:35:59,353 --> 00:36:03,653
Now it's time for partner
relaxation techniques

677
00:36:03,757 --> 00:36:05,782
for when your
special marathon begins.

678
00:36:05,859 --> 00:36:09,260
So, partners, I want you to
move behind your marathoners

679
00:36:09,329 --> 00:36:11,388
with your legs
open in a big V.

680
00:36:11,465 --> 00:36:14,093
Hm. Welcome home.

681
00:36:14,167 --> 00:36:18,866
Now, take this opportunity to
stroke your wives or girlfriends.

682
00:36:18,939 --> 00:36:20,998
Stroke it out.

683
00:36:21,074 --> 00:36:24,271
Now why don't you whisper
something special to her, okay?

684
00:36:24,344 --> 00:36:27,575
Something that only you two would
share in this private moment.

685
00:36:27,648 --> 00:36:31,516
It could be funny,
It could be naughty.

686
00:36:31,585 --> 00:36:33,780
I'm not listening.

687
00:36:33,854 --> 00:36:36,152
Let that relaxation
wash over you.

688
00:36:36,223 --> 00:36:37,747
I am so sorry
about this.

689
00:36:37,824 --> 00:36:40,258
It's, you know, you don't
have to stroke my hair.

690
00:36:40,327 --> 00:36:41,988
Okay, I'm sorry.

691
00:36:42,062 --> 00:36:44,189
Uh, you know, you can
lean back if you want.

692
00:36:44,264 --> 00:36:46,232
I, I can tell you're
kind of straining.

693
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,426
I am.

694
00:36:47,501 --> 00:36:49,867
Great. Now that
we're all relaxed,

695
00:36:49,937 --> 00:36:52,497
let's try some
birthing positions, okay?

696
00:36:52,572 --> 00:36:55,803
Mary? Could I borrow
your partner for just a sec?

697
00:36:55,876 --> 00:36:58,276
I promise I'll give
him back. Maybe.

698
00:36:58,345 --> 00:37:00,711
I'm just kidding. Come
here, cutie. All right.

699
00:37:00,781 --> 00:37:05,480
I want you to get on all fours with
your palms firmly placed to the ground

700
00:37:05,552 --> 00:37:10,012
and then we're gonna rock back.
We're gonna rock back into it. Oh.

701
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:12,388
Feel that womb open up.

702
00:37:12,459 --> 00:37:16,020
It feels familiar, right? This is
how we got ourselves into this mess.

703
00:37:16,096 --> 00:37:20,226
For some of us, not all of us.
The position's not for everybody.

704
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:25,237
Partners, I want you to
envelope your marathoner, okay?

705
00:37:25,305 --> 00:37:28,638
And just get in a deep
stretch here around the belly

706
00:37:28,709 --> 00:37:32,975
keep moving back and forth, right?
Get your hands on the tummy back there.

707
00:37:33,046 --> 00:37:36,072
And keep pushing in. Keep
pushing in and envelope.

708
00:37:36,149 --> 00:37:38,674
Get right on top of there.
Feel that, feel... Oop.

709
00:37:38,752 --> 00:37:40,083
Man down, okay.

710
00:37:40,153 --> 00:37:41,415
It's okay.

711
00:37:41,488 --> 00:37:44,355
Just hop back on.
No mistakes here.

712
00:37:44,424 --> 00:37:50,226
Okay. All right. Finish up when
you feel done. I need a few more.

713
00:37:50,297 --> 00:37:52,697
If you'll indulge
me Mary, thank you.

714
00:37:52,766 --> 00:37:56,167
Okay, and just keep the
rocking. Never stop rocking.

715
00:37:56,236 --> 00:38:01,697
Oh! Yes. Give it to me,
Rob, we're doing it now.

716
00:38:01,775 --> 00:38:05,643
Oh! Oh!

717
00:38:05,712 --> 00:38:09,045
Okay.
And we're done.

718
00:38:09,116 --> 00:38:12,017
Wonderful, thank you.
This guy's good, right?

719
00:38:12,085 --> 00:38:14,679
I'm gonna borrow
you for another class.

720
00:38:14,755 --> 00:38:18,282
Or after class.
I'm kidding.

721
00:38:22,229 --> 00:38:23,457
Bye, guys.

722
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:26,556
That was great.
Thanks a lot.

723
00:38:26,633 --> 00:38:27,827
Bye.

724
00:38:27,901 --> 00:38:29,801
Wow.
That was up there

725
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:33,306
as one of the most
embarrassing moments of my life.

726
00:38:33,373 --> 00:38:36,171
Hey, here, let me
get you something.

727
00:38:36,243 --> 00:38:39,371
No, no, it's the least I can
do after nearly paralyzing you.

728
00:38:41,481 --> 00:38:43,941
Hi.

729
00:38:47,587 --> 00:38:49,054
Thanks.

730
00:38:49,122 --> 00:38:51,647
Did you always work
in the family business?

731
00:38:51,725 --> 00:38:57,163
Uh, I wanted to be a writer. But I
was scared I might be a total hack

732
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:59,391
so I got
an accounting degree.

733
00:38:59,466 --> 00:39:02,765
I figured I'd make a living doing
that while I finished my book...

734
00:39:02,836 --> 00:39:05,396
but kind of been stuck in
the middle for a few years.

735
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:07,303
What do you wanna
be when you grow up?

736
00:39:07,374 --> 00:39:10,207
Well, in college I played
in a badass metal band.

737
00:39:10,277 --> 00:39:12,336
Really?
You're a badass?

738
00:39:12,412 --> 00:39:14,812
A little bit, kind of.

739
00:39:14,881 --> 00:39:18,578
Fascinating. A little
terrifying but fascinating.

740
00:39:18,652 --> 00:39:22,782
So is that what you did in
college, badass metal band studies?

741
00:39:22,856 --> 00:39:24,915
No, I didn't
finish college.

742
00:39:24,991 --> 00:39:28,017
Oh, why not? Too boring?
Not Joan Jett enough for you?

743
00:39:28,095 --> 00:39:33,533
No. Um, I loved college. It's just my
parents passed away in a car accident,

744
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,899
so I had to leave to take
care of my little sister.

745
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:39,200
I'm sorry. I shouldn't
have said anything.

746
00:39:39,272 --> 00:39:42,139
Oh, n-no. I, I'm
glad you told me.

747
00:39:42,209 --> 00:39:45,007
I'm just so sorry
that happened.

748
00:39:45,078 --> 00:39:46,511
Thanks.

749
00:39:48,548 --> 00:39:50,413
So is your sister
a badass like you?

750
00:39:50,484 --> 00:39:52,577
No, she's more
of a smart ass.

751
00:39:52,652 --> 00:39:55,246
Here.

752
00:39:57,591 --> 00:40:00,651
Hey, you know, uh, Suzie's
having a pool party this weekend.

753
00:40:00,727 --> 00:40:02,456
You should come.
And bring Miles.

754
00:40:02,529 --> 00:40:04,053
Pool party?

755
00:40:04,131 --> 00:40:06,497
Yeah. I promise, I won't
be wearing a Speedo.

756
00:40:21,515 --> 00:40:23,005
Nice look!

757
00:40:23,083 --> 00:40:25,916
Do we have a secret steam
room you never told me about?

758
00:40:25,986 --> 00:40:27,453
No, I'm going
to a pool party.

759
00:40:27,521 --> 00:40:29,989
Ah. Well, good thing
you've got that towel on now.

760
00:40:30,056 --> 00:40:33,082
Wouldn't wanna leave that 'til
when you actually get there.

761
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:36,095
Enough of the sass, smarty
pants. What are you doing here?

762
00:40:36,163 --> 00:40:37,824
Tennis ended early.

763
00:40:37,898 --> 00:40:39,889
What's the bag for?

764
00:40:39,966 --> 00:40:41,490
Nothing.

765
00:40:41,568 --> 00:40:44,162
Come on, you can
do better than that.

766
00:40:44,237 --> 00:40:45,761
At least I'm wearing pants.

767
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:47,602
Pants? You call
those pants?

768
00:40:47,674 --> 00:40:49,801
They're shorts.

769
00:40:49,876 --> 00:40:54,643
All right, bye. Don't
call if you need me.

770
00:40:57,984 --> 00:41:02,011
Okay, you really have to act
like you're the father, okay?

771
00:41:02,088 --> 00:41:03,350
Yeah.

772
00:41:03,423 --> 00:41:05,482
You're the father.
It's serious.

773
00:41:05,559 --> 00:41:06,753
Oh, come on.

774
00:41:06,826 --> 00:41:08,691
You have to appear
to be responsible.

775
00:41:08,762 --> 00:41:10,730
Are you kidding me?
I'm totally psyched.

776
00:41:10,797 --> 00:41:13,960
I thought about this. Everyone's
gonna think I'm a super-stud

777
00:41:14,034 --> 00:41:15,934
for knocking up a
hot chick like you.

778
00:41:16,002 --> 00:41:18,994
Okay, so, that's an example
of something you wouldn't say.

779
00:41:19,072 --> 00:41:22,473
Baby. Well, I think you're
beautiful even with your...

780
00:41:22,542 --> 00:41:23,770
Thank you.

781
00:41:30,350 --> 00:41:31,874
Hey.

782
00:41:31,952 --> 00:41:33,419
How are you?

783
00:41:33,486 --> 00:41:36,683
Nick, this is my fiance,
Miles. Miles, this is Nick.

784
00:41:36,756 --> 00:41:39,657
Congratulations.
You must be so excited.

785
00:41:39,726 --> 00:41:43,423
Oh, it's, I just can't wait
for the little guy to pop out.

786
00:41:43,496 --> 00:41:44,690
Oh, you're
having a boy.

787
00:41:44,764 --> 00:41:45,788
Yeah.

788
00:41:45,865 --> 00:41:47,162
We, uh, we
just found out.

789
00:41:47,234 --> 00:41:48,724
And do you
have a name yet?

790
00:41:48,802 --> 00:41:50,429
Now, see,
I didn't think any...

791
00:41:50,503 --> 00:41:51,595
Hey.

792
00:41:51,671 --> 00:41:53,605
Garth, this is
my fiance, Miles.

793
00:41:53,673 --> 00:41:56,198
Miles, Garth. He's an
editor at the company.

794
00:41:56,276 --> 00:41:57,675
You're a lucky guy, huh?

795
00:41:57,744 --> 00:42:02,374
Yes, I am. You look pretty
lucky yourself there.

796
00:42:02,449 --> 00:42:04,883
I'm gonna go inside
and say hi to Suzie.

797
00:42:04,951 --> 00:42:06,475
Oh, yeah,
hold up, babe.

798
00:42:06,553 --> 00:42:08,987
I'm taking a dip. It's
blazing here. Babes.

799
00:42:09,055 --> 00:42:10,079
Yeah?

800
00:42:10,156 --> 00:42:11,384
Right there.

801
00:42:11,458 --> 00:42:12,925
Anybody care to join?

802
00:42:12,993 --> 00:42:14,085
I will. Let's go in.

803
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,525
That's what
I like to hear.

804
00:42:15,595 --> 00:42:17,119
I don't wanna
get my chain wet.

805
00:42:17,197 --> 00:42:20,030
Listen, I have two friends
that I want you to meet.

806
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:23,695
They're both writers and they're
actually looking for a new publisher,

807
00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:25,567
so I think they'll
really like you.

808
00:42:25,639 --> 00:42:26,901
Really?

809
00:42:26,973 --> 00:42:28,770
You and Nick
make such a good team.

810
00:42:28,842 --> 00:42:30,070
Thank you.

811
00:42:37,350 --> 00:42:40,842
Hey, guys. I want you
to meet Audrey Gold

812
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:44,651
and Dr. Terry Bournachle. Terry
wrote the Bournachle Baby Book,

813
00:42:44,724 --> 00:42:46,589
which is the bible.

814
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:50,289
I won't even touch that. I don't wanna
be accused of having a God complex.

815
00:42:50,363 --> 00:42:53,093
And Audrey just finished
a book on single parenting

816
00:42:53,166 --> 00:42:57,500
and I hear from reliable sources that
she's not very happy at Boyle Donner.

817
00:42:57,570 --> 00:43:00,505
Oh, well we would love
to meet with you guys.

818
00:43:02,475 --> 00:43:06,002
Yeah, Nick and Thea just started
a parenting division at Steinwald.

819
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:08,445
Hmm. You have
the most unique shape.

820
00:43:08,515 --> 00:43:12,952
If you don't mind me asking, you
don't have a distended uterus, do you?

821
00:43:13,019 --> 00:43:17,251
Uh, no, no, I,
I don't think so.

822
00:43:17,324 --> 00:43:19,815
Well, who's your OB?

823
00:43:19,893 --> 00:43:24,159
Dr. Draken Barysinwitz.

824
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:27,358
You mean Hans?
Frogenberry Schoenewitz?

825
00:43:27,434 --> 00:43:29,994
I thought he moved
back to Vienna.

826
00:43:31,338 --> 00:43:32,862
Oh!

827
00:43:32,939 --> 00:43:36,500
My bad. I just, I was trying
to, totally going for her.

828
00:43:36,576 --> 00:43:38,009
Very funny, Miles.

829
00:43:38,078 --> 00:43:41,980
Hey. You should, uh, you
should totally come in.

830
00:43:42,048 --> 00:43:43,982
We're having such a good time in there.

831
00:43:44,050 --> 00:43:45,984
I don't feel like
swimming right now.

832
00:43:46,052 --> 00:43:47,986
Come on. It's
so nice in there.

833
00:43:48,054 --> 00:43:50,921
No one cares that you're fat.
Kids, tell her to come in.

834
00:43:50,990 --> 00:43:54,255
Come in. Come in. Come in.

835
00:43:54,327 --> 00:43:56,124
It's okay.

836
00:43:56,196 --> 00:43:58,426
You don't want to
disappoint the children.

837
00:43:58,498 --> 00:43:59,522
Woo!

838
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:00,861
Shit.

839
00:44:03,636 --> 00:44:04,830
What is that?

840
00:44:04,904 --> 00:44:07,834
Oh!

841
00:44:10,243 --> 00:44:11,540
That's not cool.

842
00:44:18,752 --> 00:44:20,652
It was so humiliating.

843
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:23,985
On the way home I told him to drop
me off and never speak to me again.

844
00:44:24,057 --> 00:44:27,390
Good. I always thought Miles
was a bit of a numbnut anyway.

845
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:31,362
I'm just so embarrassed that Nick
thinks he's the father of my child.

846
00:44:31,431 --> 00:44:33,058
Who cares
what Nick thinks?

847
00:44:33,133 --> 00:44:34,930
He's just the first
person in years

848
00:44:35,001 --> 00:44:38,232
that thinks I'm capable of doing
more than just pouring coffee.

849
00:44:38,304 --> 00:44:40,534
What do you think he'll
say when he finds out

850
00:44:40,607 --> 00:44:44,737
your baby is a piece of polyurethane
foam we swiped off a mannequin?

851
00:44:44,811 --> 00:44:47,609
He's actually kinda cute
though, don't you think?

852
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:48,942
Who?

853
00:44:49,015 --> 00:44:50,710
Um, Nick.

854
00:44:50,784 --> 00:44:52,547
Um, no.

855
00:44:52,619 --> 00:44:54,109
Cigarette?

856
00:44:54,187 --> 00:44:56,621
No, I probably shouldn't.

857
00:44:59,426 --> 00:45:03,760
Okay, uh, to recap, uh

858
00:45:03,830 --> 00:45:07,129
only one of you would even
bother to look at the book.

859
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:11,728
And the rest of you wouldn't
buy it with a gun to your head...

860
00:45:11,805 --> 00:45:14,273
which can't
be good for sales.

861
00:45:17,977 --> 00:45:21,037
Can any of you tell me why
the cover doesn't speak to you?

862
00:45:21,114 --> 00:45:25,414
Maybe comparing pregnancy to a
battle is, uh, putting you off.

863
00:45:25,485 --> 00:45:26,850
Yes.

864
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:29,115
I can't stay for the
rest of the focus group.

865
00:45:29,189 --> 00:45:31,817
Can I still
get my check?

866
00:45:31,891 --> 00:45:33,916
Just stop by reception.

867
00:45:39,466 --> 00:45:41,627
Okay. Uh, one down.

868
00:45:44,571 --> 00:45:47,335
Maybe we should forget what's
on the cover for a second.

869
00:45:47,407 --> 00:45:50,001
What makes this book great
is that it's a collection

870
00:45:50,076 --> 00:45:53,671
of real stories for real women talking
about how it feels to be pregnant.

871
00:45:53,746 --> 00:45:56,078
So let's talk about some
of us feel right now.

872
00:45:57,484 --> 00:45:58,849
I feel like crap.

873
00:45:58,918 --> 00:46:01,978
That's good. I mean,
that's bad. But keep going.

874
00:46:02,055 --> 00:46:06,014
How come no one talks about
how much pregnancy sucks!

875
00:46:06,092 --> 00:46:08,253
Oh, there's no
glow in my house.

876
00:46:08,328 --> 00:46:11,297
Okay, so what I'm hearing is
that you're all so over it.

877
00:46:11,364 --> 00:46:13,093
Yeah.

878
00:46:13,166 --> 00:46:15,896
Hello, I'm Orca the Whale.
Like, what's up with that?

879
00:46:15,969 --> 00:46:18,062
I know, they're not
even bloated at all.

880
00:46:18,137 --> 00:46:20,367
Thea, your
sister's at reception.

881
00:46:25,211 --> 00:46:27,111
Hey, what are
you doing here?

882
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:30,980
You forgot to sign the release for my
trip to Lake Arrowhead. It's due today.

883
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:34,918
Thea, aren't you going to
introduce me to your sister?

884
00:46:34,988 --> 00:46:37,957
Oh, Nick, Emma.
Emma, Nick.

885
00:46:38,024 --> 00:46:39,889
She's in a real rush.
She has to go.

886
00:46:41,394 --> 00:46:45,990
Okay, well, this has been
fun. It's been fun.

887
00:46:46,065 --> 00:46:47,225
What is that?

888
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:49,097
Just because you
don't like my dress

889
00:46:49,168 --> 00:46:50,795
doesn't mean you
have to be rude.

890
00:46:50,870 --> 00:46:52,735
Move. I'll
tell you outside.

891
00:46:52,805 --> 00:46:54,067
What's wrong with you?

892
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:56,199
I'm a big fat liar,
but Jerry was firing me

893
00:46:56,276 --> 00:46:57,971
I had to come up
with something.

894
00:46:59,946 --> 00:47:02,471
You are one sandwich shy
of a picnic, you know that?

895
00:47:02,549 --> 00:47:04,744
You're crazy. What
are you thinking?

896
00:47:04,817 --> 00:47:08,514
You might be interested to know
that I got a promotion and a raise.

897
00:47:08,588 --> 00:47:11,182
I can't believe we're
actually related.

898
00:47:11,257 --> 00:47:13,054
As soon as I can
I'm gonna come clean.

899
00:47:13,126 --> 00:47:16,152
Things are complicated.
The company depends on me.

900
00:47:16,229 --> 00:47:20,393
I have heard enough.
I am out of here.

901
00:47:28,675 --> 00:47:29,733
Morning, Thea.

902
00:47:29,809 --> 00:47:31,367
Last month's
and this month's.

903
00:47:31,444 --> 00:47:33,002
Wow, early.
That's a first.

904
00:47:35,281 --> 00:47:36,942
I've got
something for you.

905
00:47:37,016 --> 00:47:38,813
Oh, you made these?

906
00:47:38,885 --> 00:47:40,147
Yes.

907
00:47:40,219 --> 00:47:43,313
I went with marigold
because it's neutral.

908
00:47:43,389 --> 00:47:45,050
Thank you.

909
00:47:48,161 --> 00:47:49,355
Hey.

910
00:47:49,429 --> 00:47:52,592
Hey. Okay, not that
you're interested,

911
00:47:52,665 --> 00:47:55,657
but the word is that Nick's
divorce is finalized this week.

912
00:47:55,735 --> 00:47:56,929
Garth told me.

913
00:47:57,003 --> 00:47:58,595
Garth told you?

914
00:47:58,671 --> 00:48:01,265
I've been hanging out
with him, Miss Busy.

915
00:48:01,341 --> 00:48:04,606
I took the liberty of picking
you up a calcium-enriched smoothie

916
00:48:04,677 --> 00:48:08,078
and a bran muffin. I figured you
might be getting a little backed up.

917
00:48:08,147 --> 00:48:09,136
Thanks, Greg.

918
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:11,308
You're welcome.
Excuse me.

919
00:48:11,384 --> 00:48:13,875
Greg's worried about
you being backed up?

920
00:48:13,953 --> 00:48:16,751
Constipation is a common
problem for pregnant women.

921
00:48:16,823 --> 00:48:18,950
Ach.

922
00:48:19,025 --> 00:48:22,620
Well, lucky for you you're
not actually pregnant.

923
00:48:22,695 --> 00:48:24,629
Or do you even
know that anymore?

924
00:48:24,697 --> 00:48:26,528
Of course I know
that. Obviously.

925
00:48:28,001 --> 00:48:29,628
Hi, sorry to interrupt.

926
00:48:29,702 --> 00:48:33,138
Wanted to get you a little
something. I ordered it off of eBay.

927
00:48:35,008 --> 00:48:37,909
It's an armadillo foot for,
for when you're in labor.

928
00:48:37,977 --> 00:48:40,207
It, it wards
off the evil eye.

929
00:48:40,279 --> 00:48:42,679
Thank you so much, Carl.
That's so sweet of you.

930
00:48:42,749 --> 00:48:45,240
I'll keep it with
me the whole time.

931
00:48:45,318 --> 00:48:49,618
Oh-kay. I know I told you to go
along with this for a few weeks,

932
00:48:49,689 --> 00:48:51,657
but you're starting
to freak me out.

933
00:48:51,724 --> 00:48:53,624
Things are going
really well for me.

934
00:48:53,693 --> 00:48:56,662
It's not because of the
stomach. You're doing good work.

935
00:48:56,729 --> 00:48:59,220
The only thing you're
doing bad is walking around

936
00:48:59,298 --> 00:49:01,766
with a load of bullshit
strapped to your stomach.

937
00:49:01,834 --> 00:49:03,028
Nick. Nick.

938
00:49:03,102 --> 00:49:04,330
Nick.

939
00:49:04,404 --> 00:49:05,803
What's up?

940
00:49:05,872 --> 00:49:08,033
You won't believe who
left me a voicemail.

941
00:49:08,107 --> 00:49:10,041
An Associate
producer from the Vista.

942
00:49:10,109 --> 00:49:11,235
No way.

943
00:49:11,310 --> 00:49:12,709
She read the book,
loves it,

944
00:49:12,779 --> 00:49:14,804
with Claire's
approval, we'll be in.

945
00:49:14,881 --> 00:49:16,872
That would be
the greatest thing ever.

946
00:49:16,949 --> 00:49:18,746
Oh!

947
00:49:18,818 --> 00:49:20,012
Oh.

948
00:49:20,086 --> 00:49:23,522
Sorry. I, I'm a bit
of a closet hugger.

949
00:49:23,589 --> 00:49:25,147
I, that won't
happen again.

950
00:49:25,224 --> 00:49:26,714
That's, that's okay.

951
00:49:26,793 --> 00:49:28,488
Nick, Jerry for you.

952
00:49:28,561 --> 00:49:30,893
Oh. Uh, put
him through.

953
00:49:30,963 --> 00:49:32,863
How you holding
down the fort, Nicky?

954
00:49:32,932 --> 00:49:35,025
Good, Everything's
going great.

955
00:49:35,101 --> 00:49:36,659
Working on a little project.

956
00:49:36,736 --> 00:49:38,966
You haven't done
anything stupid, have you?

957
00:49:39,038 --> 00:49:40,369
No, of course not.

958
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:43,375
You're doing
great, sweetie.

959
00:49:45,111 --> 00:49:49,343
Do me a favor, Nick. No little
projects. Don't do anything.

960
00:49:49,415 --> 00:49:54,114
Don't touch anything. If you
need a project, try Match. Com.

961
00:49:54,187 --> 00:49:56,587
It's been awhile since
you've seen any action.

962
00:49:56,656 --> 00:49:59,147
Okay, Jerry. I'll talk
to you later. Thank you.

963
00:50:00,893 --> 00:50:02,554
It really hasn't
been that long.

964
00:50:02,628 --> 00:50:04,255
I'm, I'm sure.

965
00:50:04,330 --> 00:50:07,322
Um, okay. I got a lot of work
to do. So, I'm gonna go do it.

966
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:10,028
Okay. Bye.

967
00:50:15,241 --> 00:50:17,106
So the book comes
out in three weeks.

968
00:50:17,176 --> 00:50:19,804
That, that gives us
plenty of time for publicity.

969
00:50:25,885 --> 00:50:27,682
I hope you don't mind.

970
00:50:27,754 --> 00:50:30,188
I just couldn't
take it anymore.

971
00:50:34,427 --> 00:50:36,019
Oh, wow.

972
00:50:36,095 --> 00:50:37,426
I can see!

973
00:50:39,332 --> 00:50:42,096
God. I don't know if you know
this, but you're pregnant.

974
00:50:42,168 --> 00:50:45,365
Your sense of humor really takes
a dive after nine o'clock, huh?

975
00:50:45,438 --> 00:50:46,803
Is it after nine?

976
00:50:46,873 --> 00:50:48,238
Yeah.

977
00:50:48,307 --> 00:50:50,707
Oh, my God, I'm slave-driving
a pregnant woman.

978
00:50:50,777 --> 00:50:52,404
Not at all,
I want to be here.

979
00:50:52,478 --> 00:50:55,447
I do, I feel I'm
making up for lost time.

980
00:50:55,515 --> 00:50:58,143
And I'm really grateful
you've given me this shot.

981
00:50:58,217 --> 00:51:00,242
So, thanks.

982
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:01,616
It's my pleasure.

983
00:51:06,726 --> 00:51:08,717
You should be at
home with your fiance.

984
00:51:08,795 --> 00:51:11,093
Right. My fiance.

985
00:51:15,401 --> 00:51:17,198
I'm taking you home.

986
00:51:17,270 --> 00:51:21,434
But, I promise to have
ridiculously high expectations

987
00:51:21,507 --> 00:51:22,633
of you in the morning.

988
00:51:23,776 --> 00:51:25,209
Thank you.

989
00:51:25,278 --> 00:51:27,508
Well, here, no, no.

990
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:28,945
Okay.

991
00:52:16,996 --> 00:52:18,020
Is this your first?

992
00:52:18,097 --> 00:52:20,622
Yeah. I can't wait.
And you?

993
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:21,826
It's mine, too.

994
00:52:24,103 --> 00:52:25,627
Would you
sign this, please?

995
00:52:31,811 --> 00:52:33,335
Oh, that's amazing.

996
00:52:33,412 --> 00:52:36,973
What about
Thea? Thea?

997
00:52:37,049 --> 00:52:38,641
Absolutely, you.

998
00:52:38,718 --> 00:52:39,776
No, no, no.

999
00:52:39,852 --> 00:52:42,113
Yes.

1000
00:52:42,188 --> 00:52:43,883
No, I stay
behind the camera.

1001
00:52:43,956 --> 00:52:45,821
You, over here
right now.

1002
00:52:45,892 --> 00:52:47,757
Come on, give it a shot.

1003
00:52:50,096 --> 00:52:51,154
Oh, yeah.

1004
00:52:51,230 --> 00:52:52,322
Work it.

1005
00:52:52,398 --> 00:52:53,490
Nick.

1006
00:52:53,566 --> 00:52:55,363
Make love
to the...

1007
00:52:55,434 --> 00:52:58,164
Sorry. I know you don't
actually say that. I'm sorry.

1008
00:53:01,974 --> 00:53:04,568
Thanks for coming here with
me. I had such a craving.

1009
00:53:04,644 --> 00:53:06,635
Are you kidding me?
I love mud slide pie.

1010
00:53:06,712 --> 00:53:09,112
I think we could use a
little more whipped cream.

1011
00:53:09,181 --> 00:53:11,206
Oh, did I tell you we
signed Bournachle?

1012
00:53:11,284 --> 00:53:12,979
Thanks for hooking
us up with him.

1013
00:53:13,052 --> 00:53:15,714
My pleasure. Oh, I may
have some good news.

1014
00:53:15,788 --> 00:53:19,053
I may have gotten us two
spots in Sunshine Daycare.

1015
00:53:19,125 --> 00:53:22,253
Great. Thanks. I haven't
even thought about daycare.

1016
00:53:22,328 --> 00:53:25,092
I don't know how you do it,
with your kid, your pregnancy

1017
00:53:25,164 --> 00:53:28,224
and your job. I can't even take
care of my little sister, Emma.

1018
00:53:28,301 --> 00:53:30,462
I wish my mother left
me user instructions.

1019
00:53:30,536 --> 00:53:32,902
Well, there are no
hard and fast rules.

1020
00:53:32,972 --> 00:53:34,701
You just have to go
with your gut.

1021
00:53:34,774 --> 00:53:37,937
Yeah, well I certainly have no
shortage of gut at the moment.

1022
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:41,571
Well, when all else
fails, sugar and shopping.

1023
00:53:41,647 --> 00:53:43,638
Very persuasive.

1024
00:53:57,396 --> 00:53:58,454
Hi.

1025
00:53:58,531 --> 00:54:00,123
Hi. Is Emma here?

1026
00:54:00,199 --> 00:54:02,963
Hi, Emma. Can you
babysit tomorrow night?

1027
00:54:03,035 --> 00:54:04,969
Oh, I can't,
Donna. Sorry.

1028
00:54:05,037 --> 00:54:07,369
I have to study
with my friend Chloe.

1029
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:10,341
Um, I can do it.

1030
00:54:10,409 --> 00:54:12,104
You know, good practice.

1031
00:54:12,178 --> 00:54:15,477
That's right. Oh, God.
Thea, you are the best.

1032
00:54:15,548 --> 00:54:17,015
Tomorrow night at eight?

1033
00:54:17,083 --> 00:54:18,277
Yes.

1034
00:54:18,351 --> 00:54:19,477
Great. Bye.

1035
00:54:22,655 --> 00:54:26,386
I don't even know who you are right
now, but you're definitely not the best.

1036
00:54:26,459 --> 00:54:30,418
Do you wanna make cupcakes and then
maybe go shopping at Forever Twenty-One?

1037
00:54:30,496 --> 00:54:35,365
No. Actually I'd rather scrub
myself down with a pineapple

1038
00:54:35,434 --> 00:54:37,163
than do that.

1039
00:54:39,572 --> 00:54:41,540
I don't know what to do.

1040
00:54:41,607 --> 00:54:47,341
This was Dan's idea. He was all, like,
let's have a baby. It'll be so cute.

1041
00:54:47,413 --> 00:54:49,711
You know? I was,
like really?

1042
00:54:49,782 --> 00:54:53,775
Really? Well, let's strap 50
pounds of cement to your torso

1043
00:54:53,853 --> 00:54:57,289
and see how fun it is then.
You know, I just...

1044
00:54:57,356 --> 00:55:00,450
Yeah. I know.
I understand.

1045
00:55:00,526 --> 00:55:03,324
I just need a drink.
Or some weed.

1046
00:55:03,396 --> 00:55:05,057
I know it's scary.

1047
00:55:05,131 --> 00:55:09,363
I mean, the fact that we're gonna
have these tiny fragile humans

1048
00:55:09,435 --> 00:55:12,768
totally dependent on us. It's
kind of freaking me out, too

1049
00:55:12,838 --> 00:55:14,100
Really?

1050
00:55:14,173 --> 00:55:15,470
Yeah.

1051
00:55:15,541 --> 00:55:17,873
'Cause, Thea, you just,
you seem so together.

1052
00:55:17,943 --> 00:55:19,410
Oh, hi.

1053
00:55:19,478 --> 00:55:20,877
We need to talk.

1054
00:55:20,946 --> 00:55:22,641
What happened?

1055
00:55:22,715 --> 00:55:24,580
Okay, thanks
for listening.

1056
00:55:29,455 --> 00:55:30,979
Uh,

1057
00:55:31,057 --> 00:55:33,025
I uh,

1058
00:55:33,092 --> 00:55:35,390
I kind of got into
an altercation with Miles.

1059
00:55:35,461 --> 00:55:36,928
What are you talking about?

1060
00:55:36,996 --> 00:55:39,590
He was kissing another
woman. So I confronted him.

1061
00:55:39,665 --> 00:55:42,828
And he told me
he's not the father.

1062
00:55:42,902 --> 00:55:44,301
So I punched him.

1063
00:55:44,370 --> 00:55:45,496
You what?

1064
00:55:45,571 --> 00:55:48,904
I punched him.
I couldn't help it.

1065
00:55:48,974 --> 00:55:51,568
You deserve better than
that, Thea, a, a lot better.

1066
00:55:51,644 --> 00:55:54,875
Nick, Miles
is not the father.

1067
00:55:54,947 --> 00:55:56,744
He's not even
my boyfriend anymore.

1068
00:55:56,816 --> 00:55:59,080
The truth is,
there is no father.

1069
00:55:59,151 --> 00:56:02,951
I mean, there is but it was a one-night
stand and he's out of the picture now.

1070
00:56:03,022 --> 00:56:08,050
Thea, there is nothing wrong
with being a single mother.

1071
00:56:08,127 --> 00:56:09,287
Okay.

1072
00:56:11,063 --> 00:56:14,692
The printer has a
question He's on line one.

1073
00:56:14,767 --> 00:56:16,564
Okay.

1074
00:56:17,970 --> 00:56:19,528
Oh.

1075
00:56:19,605 --> 00:56:21,800
What was that about?
He looks like a maniac.

1076
00:56:21,874 --> 00:56:23,341
I just told
Nick the truth.

1077
00:56:23,409 --> 00:56:25,138
How'd he take it?

1078
00:56:25,211 --> 00:56:27,975
Okay. He doesn't think I
should be with Miles anyway.

1079
00:56:28,047 --> 00:56:30,379
Yeah, but what did he
say about the pregnancy?

1080
00:56:30,449 --> 00:56:32,747
He didn't say anything
about the pregnancy.

1081
00:56:32,818 --> 00:56:34,410
What's there to say?

1082
00:56:34,487 --> 00:56:37,581
Thea. We should talk. Do you
want to get a beer after work?

1083
00:56:37,656 --> 00:56:40,591
A beer? You know
I can't drink.

1084
00:56:45,798 --> 00:56:47,766
Is your stomach growing?

1085
00:56:47,833 --> 00:56:49,767
Well, I'm nearly
six months now.

1086
00:56:56,108 --> 00:56:57,370
Hi, how are you?

1087
00:56:57,443 --> 00:56:59,570
Where's my
sister, Emma?

1088
00:57:01,413 --> 00:57:04,007
Hey.

1089
00:57:04,083 --> 00:57:05,914
How was practice?

1090
00:57:05,985 --> 00:57:07,816
Fine. Same as usual.

1091
00:57:07,887 --> 00:57:12,654
Really? That's funny because Coach
Henretti told me you quit a month ago.

1092
00:57:12,725 --> 00:57:16,627
I found this in your backpack.
You've got some explaining to do.

1093
00:57:16,695 --> 00:57:19,220
That's dried cilantro.

1094
00:57:19,298 --> 00:57:20,356
Yeah, right.

1095
00:57:20,432 --> 00:57:22,024
Smell it.

1096
00:57:24,904 --> 00:57:27,134
Okay, maybe it is. But
where were you today?

1097
00:57:27,206 --> 00:57:30,073
At Jake's,
waiting tables.

1098
00:57:30,142 --> 00:57:32,440
You've been
lying for weeks.

1099
00:57:32,511 --> 00:57:34,001
Hey, I learn
from the best.

1100
00:57:40,553 --> 00:57:44,045
Hey, um, your
boss is here.

1101
00:57:44,123 --> 00:57:45,488
What?

1102
00:57:45,558 --> 00:57:47,856
Maybe he wants
to make cupcakes with you.

1103
00:57:47,927 --> 00:57:50,054
Um, can you get my
stomach? It's in my room.

1104
00:57:50,129 --> 00:57:54,623
Yeah. But, um, it'll
cost you 25 bucks.

1105
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:55,962
15!

1106
00:57:56,035 --> 00:57:57,627
Sold.

1107
00:57:57,703 --> 00:58:00,467
She'll be right with you.
She's just getting dressed.

1108
00:58:00,539 --> 00:58:01,528
Okay, thanks.

1109
00:58:07,479 --> 00:58:11,142
Does it make you feel weird knowing
she's naked only, like, ten feet away.

1110
00:58:11,217 --> 00:58:12,741
Em!

1111
00:58:12,818 --> 00:58:14,342
Coming.

1112
00:58:14,420 --> 00:58:15,478
Stomach.

1113
00:58:15,554 --> 00:58:16,782
No. Pay me.

1114
00:58:16,855 --> 00:58:18,846
I'll pay you after.
Give me the stomach.

1115
00:58:18,924 --> 00:58:22,223
A promise from Thea? I can't take
that to the bank. Just pay me know.

1116
00:58:26,665 --> 00:58:29,657
Thank you.
Here's your fake belly.

1117
00:58:29,735 --> 00:58:30,702
Shut up. Get out.

1118
00:58:33,239 --> 00:58:34,297
Hello.

1119
00:58:34,373 --> 00:58:35,533
Hey.

1120
00:58:35,608 --> 00:58:37,508
Okay.

1121
00:58:37,576 --> 00:58:38,907
Hey.

1122
00:58:38,978 --> 00:58:41,503
Um, I, I just, I thought
I'd stop by, uh...

1123
00:58:41,580 --> 00:58:44,515
I wanted to show
you something.

1124
00:58:44,583 --> 00:58:49,020
It's our very first complete copy of
the book with cover and everything.

1125
00:58:49,088 --> 00:58:52,751
That's, that's great!
And, wow, I'm on the cover.

1126
00:58:52,825 --> 00:58:56,261
Oh. And we booked, uh, Tynan's
bookstore for the book launch.

1127
00:58:56,328 --> 00:58:57,625
That's awesome.

1128
00:58:57,696 --> 00:58:59,857
Well, um, I should
probably get outta here

1129
00:58:59,932 --> 00:59:01,797
and let you
enjoy your Saturday.

1130
00:59:01,867 --> 00:59:04,563
Well, um, if you're free
then do you wanna get coffee?

1131
00:59:04,637 --> 00:59:05,899
Sure.

1132
00:59:09,141 --> 00:59:13,407
I had a dog once. Then Jerry stole
it, took it to college with him.

1133
00:59:13,479 --> 00:59:14,969
Oh.

1134
00:59:15,047 --> 00:59:18,380
There's something amazing
about having a child.

1135
00:59:18,450 --> 00:59:23,786
It makes you feel like a
part of something bigger,

1136
00:59:23,856 --> 00:59:28,452
you know, even if it's not
real. Well, for me, that is.

1137
00:59:30,296 --> 00:59:34,289
Lydia didn't want children.
And I never questioned it.

1138
00:59:34,366 --> 00:59:36,596
But now I,

1139
00:59:36,669 --> 00:59:42,630
I realize, I, I do
wanna be a father.

1140
01:00:02,294 --> 01:00:05,821
I've been wanting to do
that for a really long time.

1141
01:00:05,898 --> 01:00:08,196
Actually, I just,
just did that.

1142
01:00:08,267 --> 01:00:09,894
Right.

1143
01:00:09,968 --> 01:00:12,698
We should probably take
things slowly though.

1144
01:00:12,771 --> 01:00:14,238
Absolutely.

1145
01:00:14,306 --> 01:00:16,035
Yeah.

1146
01:00:28,854 --> 01:00:31,186
I have to...
I just realized...

1147
01:00:31,256 --> 01:00:32,814
I have to go.

1148
01:00:32,891 --> 01:00:35,382
There's somewhere...
I have to go somewhere.

1149
01:00:35,461 --> 01:00:36,621
Sure. Okay.

1150
01:00:36,695 --> 01:00:38,560
My sister...
I'll talk to you later.

1151
01:00:38,630 --> 01:00:39,961
Okay.

1152
01:00:57,015 --> 01:00:59,279
Yes, she's due
the sixth of October.

1153
01:00:59,351 --> 01:01:01,945
Alright. Okay.

1154
01:01:02,020 --> 01:01:05,251
That was your friend,
Rachel. And these are for you.

1155
01:01:05,324 --> 01:01:07,224
She saw the book
at Crown Books.

1156
01:01:07,292 --> 01:01:09,658
How come you didn't
tell her you were pregnant?

1157
01:01:09,728 --> 01:01:12,196
I thought I told her. It
must have slipped my mind.

1158
01:01:12,264 --> 01:01:13,856
Pregnancy brain.

1159
01:01:13,932 --> 01:01:17,026
I was planning on waiting a
little longer to start a family.

1160
01:01:17,102 --> 01:01:19,332
Sow my wild oats
a little bit.

1161
01:01:19,405 --> 01:01:22,499
But, I feel like there is
a larger purpose for me.

1162
01:01:22,574 --> 01:01:27,739
Thea, you need someone who
is smart and responsible.

1163
01:01:27,813 --> 01:01:29,337
Oh, God.

1164
01:01:29,415 --> 01:01:32,942
I offer myself to you, mind
and body, heart and soul.

1165
01:01:33,018 --> 01:01:35,486
Let me be your
baby daddy.

1166
01:01:35,554 --> 01:01:39,217
Uh-uh-uh, that's
very generous of you.

1167
01:01:39,291 --> 01:01:43,523
But it's, you know...
that's not gonna ha...

1168
01:01:43,595 --> 01:01:46,359
Don't worry about it.
It's a tough decision.

1169
01:01:46,432 --> 01:01:48,332
Thea, can I
talk to you?

1170
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:49,867
Yeah, sure, yes.

1171
01:01:49,935 --> 01:01:51,197
Yes, absolutely.

1172
01:01:51,270 --> 01:01:53,135
If you could let me know before lunch.

1173
01:01:53,205 --> 01:01:55,070
I have a J date
I'd have to cancel.

1174
01:01:55,140 --> 01:01:58,507
I don't want to do that if I don't
have to. She's a little older...

1175
01:02:00,712 --> 01:02:02,202
So you're
ready for tonight?

1176
01:02:02,281 --> 01:02:04,272
Yeah. Totally.

1177
01:02:04,349 --> 01:02:06,544
We should clear the air.

1178
01:02:10,088 --> 01:02:12,613
I've been thinking a lot
about what happened.

1179
01:02:12,691 --> 01:02:14,852
And I feel
terrible about it.

1180
01:02:14,927 --> 01:02:16,519
You do?

1181
01:02:16,595 --> 01:02:20,258
I'm your boss and I made...
I made a pass at you.

1182
01:02:20,332 --> 01:02:22,630
Nick, that's not it.
I made a pass at you.

1183
01:02:22,701 --> 01:02:24,896
I caught that pass
and I threw it back.

1184
01:02:24,970 --> 01:02:25,994
And I liked it.

1185
01:02:26,071 --> 01:02:27,402
You did?

1186
01:02:27,473 --> 01:02:29,270
Look, that's not
what it is,

1187
01:02:32,211 --> 01:02:34,008
I'm just afraid of...

1188
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:37,378
There's a guy, Philip, at
reception. He says he's the father?

1189
01:02:37,449 --> 01:02:39,041
Do want me
to talk to this guy?

1190
01:02:39,117 --> 01:02:40,914
No, no, no.
It's okay.

1191
01:02:40,986 --> 01:02:42,248
I'll talk to him.

1192
01:02:42,321 --> 01:02:44,653
It's okay. Thank you both. Excuse me.

1193
01:02:44,723 --> 01:02:47,487
Young man, don't you have
any sense of responsibility?

1194
01:02:47,559 --> 01:02:50,392
I didn't even know, lady.
She never returned my calls.

1195
01:02:50,462 --> 01:02:53,056
Christ, is it
mine, Thea?

1196
01:02:53,131 --> 01:02:54,530
Believe me,
it's not yours.

1197
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:56,761
You can't be sure.
I did the math.

1198
01:02:56,835 --> 01:02:58,166
Believe me.
I can be sure.

1199
01:02:58,237 --> 01:02:59,932
I demand a DNA test!

1200
01:03:00,005 --> 01:03:01,063
Yeah. I'll tell her.

1201
01:03:01,139 --> 01:03:02,538
Bye.

1202
01:03:02,608 --> 01:03:04,405
Your sister
needs you at home.

1203
01:03:04,476 --> 01:03:06,068
A fire
in the toilet?

1204
01:03:06,144 --> 01:03:09,136
Your toilet's on fire? Isn't
that technically impossible?

1205
01:03:09,214 --> 01:03:10,613
Who's Philip?

1206
01:03:10,682 --> 01:03:13,708
Uh, an old, old boyfriend.
Big misunderstanding.

1207
01:03:13,785 --> 01:03:15,047
Everything okay?

1208
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:17,714
Yeah. Everything's okay.
No worries here.

1209
01:03:17,789 --> 01:03:21,725
Completely under control. But, uh, I,
I should probably get home to my sister.

1210
01:03:21,793 --> 01:03:24,284
I'll meet you at the party. Whoa. Sorry.

1211
01:03:38,410 --> 01:03:41,376
Surprise!

1212
01:03:43,382 --> 01:03:44,872
Hi, everyone.

1213
01:03:44,950 --> 01:03:46,611
Oh my God,
Aunt Betty!

1214
01:03:46,685 --> 01:03:49,313
Surprise, darlin'. Darlin'.

1215
01:03:49,388 --> 01:03:52,186
It's so good
to see you.

1216
01:03:52,257 --> 01:03:55,249
Aunt Jane and I just
drove in from Seattle.

1217
01:03:55,327 --> 01:03:58,490
Oh, Aunt, thank you, it's
so sweet of you to do this.

1218
01:03:58,564 --> 01:04:01,055
Thank you.

1219
01:04:03,735 --> 01:04:04,963
Oooh!

1220
01:04:05,037 --> 01:04:07,062
Ooh, it's a onesies.
Just what I needed.

1221
01:04:07,139 --> 01:04:08,663
We all decorated them.

1222
01:04:08,740 --> 01:04:10,605
Who made this one?

1223
01:04:13,879 --> 01:04:14,903
And this one?

1224
01:04:16,582 --> 01:04:18,345
What a good job, Sam!

1225
01:04:21,653 --> 01:04:23,382
That one's mine.

1226
01:04:23,455 --> 01:04:24,979
I just thought

1227
01:04:25,057 --> 01:04:27,525
it was
a little ironic.

1228
01:04:27,593 --> 01:04:31,188
More people are
coming. Hi. Who is it?

1229
01:04:31,263 --> 01:04:33,993
Whoa.

1230
01:04:34,066 --> 01:04:37,627
Hey, well, I hate to break up the
party, but, uh, we need to talk.

1231
01:04:37,703 --> 01:04:39,637
Everybody hang
onto your seats

1232
01:04:39,705 --> 01:04:41,935
just in case something
happens to her story.

1233
01:04:42,007 --> 01:04:44,908
Uh, no, I should get changed.
I need to be at a work event.

1234
01:04:44,977 --> 01:04:47,172
So thank you
for the shower, everyone.

1235
01:04:47,245 --> 01:04:49,042
Thank you.

1236
01:04:49,114 --> 01:04:50,411
Bye.

1237
01:04:53,619 --> 01:04:57,487
She is so out of control.
Look. She has stockpiled

1238
01:04:57,556 --> 01:05:01,686
all of this random stuff in her
closet. I mean, what is this? Seriously.

1239
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:03,421
It was on sale.

1240
01:05:03,495 --> 01:05:07,158
Okay. I need you to say, My name
is Thea and I am not pregnant.

1241
01:05:07,232 --> 01:05:09,860
This is ridiculous.
And I've gotta go.

1242
01:05:09,935 --> 01:05:11,061
Come here.

1243
01:05:13,105 --> 01:05:15,471
You have got
to come clean.

1244
01:05:17,075 --> 01:05:21,512
I will. Okay?
I promise. Just not yet.

1245
01:05:21,580 --> 01:05:25,311
It's just I'm better pregnant.
For once, my life doesn't suck.

1246
01:05:25,384 --> 01:05:29,218
And I can't go back to being
Jerry's secretary or unemployed.

1247
01:05:29,287 --> 01:05:32,723
What are you gonna do? Stay
pregnant for the rest of your life?

1248
01:05:32,791 --> 01:05:36,249
People will
get suspicious.

1249
01:05:36,328 --> 01:05:38,660
Act like a grown-up.
Stop playing dress-up.

1250
01:05:38,730 --> 01:05:41,995
Oh, my God, this is ridiculous.
Take off the stomach now!

1251
01:05:42,067 --> 01:05:43,227
No.

1252
01:05:43,301 --> 01:05:45,030
Then I'm gonna
take it off for you.

1253
01:05:45,103 --> 01:05:46,297
Get off of me!

1254
01:05:46,371 --> 01:05:47,531
Let me take it off!

1255
01:05:47,606 --> 01:05:48,800
Get off of me.

1256
01:05:48,874 --> 01:05:52,332
Oh, hey! Hey, guys! Emma, stop it!

1257
01:05:52,411 --> 01:05:53,969
Stop it!

1258
01:05:54,046 --> 01:05:55,308
Let me take it off!

1259
01:05:55,380 --> 01:05:56,813
Making noise.

1260
01:05:56,882 --> 01:05:58,110
They are
making noise.

1261
01:05:58,183 --> 01:05:59,377
Hey! Stop it!

1262
01:05:59,451 --> 01:06:00,577
Take that thing off.

1263
01:06:00,652 --> 01:06:03,212
I said stop. Gosh.

1264
01:06:03,288 --> 01:06:05,552
Come on.

1265
01:06:05,624 --> 01:06:06,784
Stay back!

1266
01:06:06,858 --> 01:06:08,382
I'll get that
thing off of you.

1267
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:09,586
Get off of me!

1268
01:06:09,661 --> 01:06:11,356
I'm gonna take
that thing off now!

1269
01:06:11,430 --> 01:06:12,454
Give it back!

1270
01:06:12,531 --> 01:06:13,828
Agh.

1271
01:06:13,899 --> 01:06:15,457
What are you doing?

1272
01:06:18,070 --> 01:06:19,901
You are so grounded!

1273
01:06:19,971 --> 01:06:21,233
Forever!

1274
01:06:26,678 --> 01:06:29,146
Uh, ladies.

1275
01:06:29,214 --> 01:06:31,148
I think we need
to re-group.

1276
01:06:31,216 --> 01:06:34,083
Stark raving mad.

1277
01:06:39,357 --> 01:06:40,415
Excuse me.

1278
01:06:43,095 --> 01:06:45,256
What are you doing?

1279
01:06:51,236 --> 01:06:53,101
I thought
she was pregnant.

1280
01:06:54,339 --> 01:06:56,330
Um.

1281
01:06:56,408 --> 01:06:58,273
I'm really confused.

1282
01:07:08,887 --> 01:07:13,722
Well, that is the last time I
throw a surprise party for anyone.

1283
01:07:13,792 --> 01:07:15,521
That baked zitti
goes home with me.

1284
01:07:22,234 --> 01:07:24,634
Sorry. I had to take
care of things with Em.

1285
01:07:24,703 --> 01:07:26,193
The toilet fire?

1286
01:07:26,271 --> 01:07:28,102
Yeah, I got the blaze under control.

1287
01:07:28,173 --> 01:07:31,040
You guys are amazing. This
is a great turnout. Thank you.

1288
01:07:31,109 --> 01:07:33,009
Okay.

1289
01:07:33,078 --> 01:07:37,845
Time to struggle with public
speaking. Sit back and enjoy.

1290
01:07:37,916 --> 01:07:39,281
You're gonna
be great.

1291
01:07:39,351 --> 01:07:40,375
Thanks.

1292
01:07:44,055 --> 01:07:46,546
What was that?
Are you guys...

1293
01:07:46,625 --> 01:07:49,116
I don't know.
Maybe. Kinda.

1294
01:07:49,194 --> 01:07:50,661
Hey. Good.

1295
01:07:50,729 --> 01:07:54,756
Good evening,
everyone. I'm back!

1296
01:07:54,833 --> 01:07:57,301
MacArthur finished
rehab a week early.

1297
01:07:57,369 --> 01:08:00,998
What's the matter, Nicky? You
don't look happy to see me.

1298
01:08:01,072 --> 01:08:03,939
Of course I am, Jerry.
Welcome back.

1299
01:08:04,009 --> 01:08:06,170
You're just in time
for Suzie's reading.

1300
01:08:06,244 --> 01:08:07,905
I got a little
surprise for you.

1301
01:08:07,979 --> 01:08:11,005
I just signed Rumsfeld
for his first book deal!

1302
01:08:11,082 --> 01:08:12,447
Donald?

1303
01:08:12,517 --> 01:08:14,644
No, Carlos.
Of course Donald.

1304
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:16,710
I met him
at the rehab facility.

1305
01:08:16,788 --> 01:08:18,779
His cat had a terrible
case of sciatica.

1306
01:08:18,857 --> 01:08:22,588
They had to put the poor thing on
oxycontin. She got addicted. It was a mess.

1307
01:08:22,661 --> 01:08:24,390
I'm in the middle
of something.

1308
01:08:24,462 --> 01:08:27,295
Rummy's book is genius. It's
gonna put us back on the map.

1309
01:08:27,365 --> 01:08:29,993
It's a completely unique
opus about his time in Iraq

1310
01:08:30,068 --> 01:08:32,366
sprinkled with some
of his favorite recipes.

1311
01:08:32,437 --> 01:08:34,905
It's called "Fire It Up. "
Here's the manuscript.

1312
01:08:34,973 --> 01:08:38,238
It sounds great, Jerry, but I've
got a reading now. Can this wait?

1313
01:08:38,310 --> 01:08:40,540
You know what?
I'll be reading my book.

1314
01:08:40,612 --> 01:08:43,206
I'm shutting down
your little operation.

1315
01:08:45,417 --> 01:08:47,180
Jerry, Suzie's
book is a real gem.

1316
01:08:47,252 --> 01:08:48,947
It could be a hit
for the company.

1317
01:08:49,020 --> 01:08:52,512
What are you so afraid of? That
I might do a better job than you?

1318
01:08:52,591 --> 01:08:54,752
Hmm. Let me think.

1319
01:08:54,826 --> 01:08:58,455
Have you ever done better
than me at anything?

1320
01:08:58,530 --> 01:09:01,863
Hello, everybody. I've got
a treat for you tonight.

1321
01:09:01,933 --> 01:09:05,164
I'm gonna be reading from
Donald Rumsfeld's new book.

1322
01:09:05,237 --> 01:09:07,603
Here's a particularly
touching passage

1323
01:09:07,672 --> 01:09:11,073
about a short rib recipe he
picked up while in Baghdad.

1324
01:09:11,142 --> 01:09:14,339
Suzie's reading. Go read your
cookbook somewhere else, Jerry.

1325
01:09:14,412 --> 01:09:16,846
Step away
from the podium now!

1326
01:09:18,016 --> 01:09:19,984
Make me.

1327
01:09:20,752 --> 01:09:21,810
He begins.

1328
01:09:21,887 --> 01:09:23,047
Agh!

1329
01:09:30,028 --> 01:09:31,620
Get off!

1330
01:09:31,696 --> 01:09:34,563
Okay. Okay.
Stop itl That's enough.

1331
01:09:34,633 --> 01:09:37,830
That's enough.
Stop it. Get off of him.

1332
01:09:37,903 --> 01:09:41,464
How pathetic. You have to
have your secretary defend you.

1333
01:09:41,539 --> 01:09:43,063
She's not a secretary.

1334
01:09:43,141 --> 01:09:46,201
Oh, really? Then what is
she, other than shrill?

1335
01:09:46,278 --> 01:09:48,906
She's a fantastic editor.

1336
01:09:48,980 --> 01:09:52,882
Oh, that's rich.
An editor?

1337
01:09:52,951 --> 01:09:56,819
So I go away for a few months,
and the world's lamest accountant

1338
01:09:56,888 --> 01:09:59,914
is running my company with
the world's dumbest secretary.

1339
01:09:59,991 --> 01:10:02,357
All I can say is,

1340
01:10:02,427 --> 01:10:04,861
I hope your kid
doesn't inherit your brains.

1341
01:10:06,731 --> 01:10:07,925
Oh!

1342
01:10:07,999 --> 01:10:09,762
Be careful!
Be careful

1343
01:10:09,834 --> 01:10:11,096
Oh, God!

1344
01:10:14,973 --> 01:10:17,441
Oh.

1345
01:10:17,509 --> 01:10:20,307
What happened
to your stomach?

1346
01:10:27,285 --> 01:10:29,845
Oh, Nicky.

1347
01:10:29,921 --> 01:10:32,822
You always were such
a good judge of character.

1348
01:10:32,891 --> 01:10:36,156
Nick. I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

1349
01:10:36,227 --> 01:10:40,323
I never meant for things to go this far.

1350
01:10:40,398 --> 01:10:44,698
Jerry was gonna fire me and I
couldn't afford to get fired.

1351
01:10:44,769 --> 01:10:48,466
And I thought the whole thing
would blow over in a day or two.

1352
01:10:48,540 --> 01:10:51,008
Blow over
in a day or two?

1353
01:10:54,946 --> 01:10:57,346
What kind of person
pretends to be pregnant?

1354
01:11:02,654 --> 01:11:04,918
Nick. I'm sorry. Just...

1355
01:11:04,990 --> 01:11:06,890
Please, just... Nick.

1356
01:11:24,909 --> 01:11:27,571
Hey, Nick, it's Thea, um

1357
01:11:27,645 --> 01:11:29,840
I'm kinda wondering
what you're up to.

1358
01:11:29,914 --> 01:11:33,406
Kinda of assuming that what
you're up to is hating me.

1359
01:11:33,485 --> 01:11:36,477
Kinda feeling very
bad about that.

1360
01:11:36,554 --> 01:11:39,022
Anyway. Call me.

1361
01:11:41,693 --> 01:11:43,854
Hi, Nick.
Thea again.

1362
01:11:43,928 --> 01:11:48,297
I just wanna say
that I'm so so sorry.

1363
01:11:48,366 --> 01:11:50,891
I was talking to
your mother about it.

1364
01:11:50,969 --> 01:11:53,301
She and I are on the
same page on this thing.

1365
01:11:53,371 --> 01:11:57,535
I would rather say extra virgin olive
oil. I don't wanna abbreviate it.

1366
01:11:57,609 --> 01:12:02,103
Hi, Nick, it's me. Uh.

1367
01:12:02,180 --> 01:12:05,149
I know you haven't been
interested in picking up the phone

1368
01:12:05,216 --> 01:12:09,277
But I just wanted to tell you
how much I really, really...

1369
01:12:20,932 --> 01:12:22,399
Hi.

1370
01:12:22,467 --> 01:12:24,526
Hi!

1371
01:12:26,104 --> 01:12:27,537
Wow!

1372
01:12:30,241 --> 01:12:32,106
So...

1373
01:12:32,177 --> 01:12:35,169
what have
you been up to?

1374
01:12:35,246 --> 01:12:38,841
Watching the Vista
on an endless loop.

1375
01:12:38,917 --> 01:12:40,714
It's self-inflicted torture.

1376
01:12:40,785 --> 01:12:42,377
That sounds healthy.

1377
01:12:42,454 --> 01:12:45,321
Well, it smells like
something died in here.

1378
01:12:45,390 --> 01:12:46,880
It did.

1379
01:12:46,958 --> 01:12:49,051
My soul.

1380
01:12:49,127 --> 01:12:51,721
Thea. You've gotta give
yourself a tiny break.

1381
01:12:51,796 --> 01:12:53,024
People make mistakes.

1382
01:12:53,098 --> 01:12:54,531
I majorly screwed up.

1383
01:12:54,599 --> 01:12:56,692
Well, look on
the bright side.

1384
01:12:56,768 --> 01:12:58,895
They're still talking
about it at work.

1385
01:12:58,970 --> 01:13:00,096
How's Nick doing?

1386
01:13:00,171 --> 01:13:02,605
I don't know.
He resigned.

1387
01:13:02,674 --> 01:13:04,369
What?

1388
01:13:04,442 --> 01:13:06,706
Did he say anything
about what he's gonna do?

1389
01:13:06,778 --> 01:13:10,111
If you're asking me if he said he'd
track you down and propose to you

1390
01:13:10,181 --> 01:13:12,547
and spend the rest
of your lives together?

1391
01:13:12,617 --> 01:13:14,380
No. He wasn't specific.

1392
01:13:14,452 --> 01:13:17,216
I've been calling
him and calling him.

1393
01:13:17,288 --> 01:13:19,153
And he won't call me back.

1394
01:13:19,224 --> 01:13:21,317
Yeah, well maybe that
has something to do

1395
01:13:21,392 --> 01:13:25,158
with the massively twisted lie you've
told him for the last few months.

1396
01:13:25,230 --> 01:13:27,164
Do you think
he'll ever forgive me?

1397
01:13:29,367 --> 01:13:32,700
Do you want me to be honest or do
you want me to make you feel better?

1398
01:13:32,770 --> 01:13:35,068
How are Suzie's book sales?

1399
01:13:35,140 --> 01:13:36,937
Good.

1400
01:13:37,008 --> 01:13:40,910
You know, uh, there's
still a few boxes

1401
01:13:40,979 --> 01:13:43,277
that we need to
distribute here and there.

1402
01:13:43,348 --> 01:13:44,610
Oh, no.

1403
01:13:56,628 --> 01:13:57,890
Sorry.

1404
01:13:57,962 --> 01:14:00,959
Hey.

1405
01:14:01,032 --> 01:14:02,329
Mind if I join you?

1406
01:14:03,902 --> 01:14:05,392
It's a free country.

1407
01:14:17,382 --> 01:14:19,373
Hm. What's
in this? Mint?

1408
01:14:19,450 --> 01:14:21,008
Yup.

1409
01:14:21,085 --> 01:14:23,519
It's perfect
with the pear.

1410
01:14:23,588 --> 01:14:25,385
It's so unexpected.

1411
01:14:25,456 --> 01:14:29,153
That was actually, um, my idea. I
kind of just thought it would work.

1412
01:14:30,862 --> 01:14:32,591
Dad would
have loved it.

1413
01:14:32,664 --> 01:14:35,292
Mom would have
thought it was too fussy.

1414
01:14:35,366 --> 01:14:39,928
But she would have polished off the
leftovers after everyone went to bed.

1415
01:14:45,176 --> 01:14:48,077
I'm a big fat liar and I'm
sorry you got stuck with me.

1416
01:14:50,215 --> 01:14:52,911
Listen, Em. We're gonna
make this work. Okay?

1417
01:14:52,984 --> 01:14:56,943
I made an appointment with the Culinary
Institute to talk about student loans.

1418
01:14:57,021 --> 01:15:00,616
And I talked to Ms.
Talbot about scholarships.

1419
01:15:00,692 --> 01:15:03,923
You know, Mom and Dad would
have been so proud of you.

1420
01:15:03,995 --> 01:15:05,587
Thanks.

1421
01:15:17,308 --> 01:15:19,003
It needs, um...

1422
01:15:20,445 --> 01:15:21,935
I think
ten more minutes.

1423
01:15:22,013 --> 01:15:23,537
I don't have
ten more minutes.

1424
01:15:23,615 --> 01:15:25,378
But it's gonna
be all gooey inside.

1425
01:15:25,450 --> 01:15:27,213
I'll just have
to take my chances.

1426
01:15:27,285 --> 01:15:30,448
Here she comes. Here
comes Claire, everybody.

1427
01:15:30,521 --> 01:15:32,751
I love you.

1428
01:15:32,824 --> 01:15:35,019
I haven't missed
a show in five years.

1429
01:15:35,093 --> 01:15:37,061
Thank you. But you
should get out more.

1430
01:15:37,128 --> 01:15:38,288
I'm kidding.

1431
01:15:38,363 --> 01:15:40,228
I'm Thea Clayhill,
your biggest fan.

1432
01:15:40,298 --> 01:15:43,062
I made you a pineapple cake.
It's your favorite, right?

1433
01:15:43,134 --> 01:15:45,227
Yes. Good reconnaissance. Good for you.

1434
01:15:45,303 --> 01:15:48,636
How did you know
about the cake?

1435
01:15:48,706 --> 01:15:51,300
Her May 15th show.
She said it in passing.

1436
01:15:54,345 --> 01:15:56,074
Hi. I have some
books for you.

1437
01:15:56,147 --> 01:15:58,342
Oh, great. Just leave
'em right over there.

1438
01:15:58,416 --> 01:16:00,714
Okay. Keep your womb open.

1439
01:16:00,785 --> 01:16:02,309
You've got it.

1440
01:16:02,387 --> 01:16:05,948
I actually would like even
more toppings on my... Hello.

1441
01:16:06,024 --> 01:16:09,357
Hey. Thea Clayhill, your number
one fan with banana cream pie.

1442
01:16:09,427 --> 01:16:12,919
You do your homework. I hope it's
as delicious as your pineapple cake.

1443
01:16:22,674 --> 01:16:24,835
You can hit a few more
potholes next time.

1444
01:16:24,909 --> 01:16:26,206
Claire, I love you.

1445
01:16:26,277 --> 01:16:27,767
There she is. Claire.

1446
01:16:27,845 --> 01:16:30,211
There she is. My number
one fan, Thea Clayhill.

1447
01:16:30,281 --> 01:16:32,215
Uh, pear ginger pie.

1448
01:16:32,283 --> 01:16:34,342
Nicely done,
Betty Crocker.

1449
01:16:34,419 --> 01:16:36,649
It's actually not me,
it's my little sister.

1450
01:16:36,721 --> 01:16:38,814
What's your angle
besides making me a pig?

1451
01:16:38,890 --> 01:16:40,687
Wanna get your
little sister on TV?

1452
01:16:40,758 --> 01:16:44,216
I really want to get this book
on TV. It's really special.

1453
01:16:44,295 --> 01:16:47,423
Okay. Thank you.

1454
01:16:47,498 --> 01:16:48,863
Thanks.

1455
01:16:50,435 --> 01:16:51,595
Good luck.

1456
01:17:03,081 --> 01:17:06,378
Hi.

1457
01:17:09,087 --> 01:17:11,817
I bet I'm the last person
you wanted to see right now.

1458
01:17:11,889 --> 01:17:15,290
Well, maybe
not the last person.

1459
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:17,954
Maybe the second
or third to last person.

1460
01:17:18,029 --> 01:17:22,159
I wouldn't want to see my 6th grade
English teacher, Ms. Posey. She was awful.

1461
01:17:22,233 --> 01:17:25,361
Or my college boyfriend. He
dumped me on an answering machine.

1462
01:17:25,436 --> 01:17:28,803
Listen, Suzie.
I'm really sorry,

1463
01:17:28,873 --> 01:17:32,036
I really wish I could have been
the person you thought I was.

1464
01:17:32,110 --> 01:17:34,078
I just figured
if I told you the truth,

1465
01:17:34,145 --> 01:17:38,241
you wouldn't want me in your life
and I really enjoyed being in yours.

1466
01:17:38,316 --> 01:17:41,342
I really enjoyed
being in your life, too,

1467
01:17:41,419 --> 01:17:43,444
for what it's worth.

1468
01:17:43,521 --> 01:17:45,819
Well, I've got some
really good news.

1469
01:17:45,890 --> 01:17:47,050
We're gonna...

1470
01:17:47,125 --> 01:17:48,319
Ow!

1471
01:17:48,393 --> 01:17:50,054
Oh, my God,
are you okay?

1472
01:17:50,128 --> 01:17:52,153
The baby's coming.

1473
01:17:52,230 --> 01:17:53,322
Right now?

1474
01:17:53,398 --> 01:17:55,025
My water broke
this morning.

1475
01:17:55,099 --> 01:17:57,329
My contractions
started an hour ago. Ow!

1476
01:17:57,402 --> 01:17:58,801
Where is everyone?

1477
01:17:58,870 --> 01:18:01,600
Jesse's on his way.

1478
01:18:01,672 --> 01:18:06,700
What should I do? Hot water? Towels? Let's
just get in the car and go to the hospital.

1479
01:18:06,778 --> 01:18:10,077
A lot of people can help us
there. I can't really do much here.

1480
01:18:10,148 --> 01:18:12,241
No, no, no.
I'm fine. I'm fine.

1481
01:18:12,316 --> 01:18:14,011
My contraction ended.

1482
01:18:14,085 --> 01:18:16,019
It'll be hours before
I have this baby.

1483
01:18:16,087 --> 01:18:17,520
It's already
that painful?

1484
01:18:17,588 --> 01:18:19,988
You ain't seen
nothin' yet.

1485
01:18:20,057 --> 01:18:23,220
It's gonna get a whole lot worse
before we turn this mother out.

1486
01:18:23,294 --> 01:18:25,285
What were you saying?

1487
01:18:25,363 --> 01:18:27,126
Oh, um, the Vista
wants you.

1488
01:18:28,833 --> 01:18:30,300
Are you sure
this is normal?

1489
01:18:30,368 --> 01:18:34,361
Yes, it's fine. The Vista?
That's amazing. When?

1490
01:18:34,439 --> 01:18:36,737
In two hours.
They had a cancellation.

1491
01:18:36,808 --> 01:18:39,368
Yeah. That's not
gonna work for me.

1492
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:45,278
Hurry! We're
gonna be late!

1493
01:18:49,887 --> 01:18:51,650
Hello.

1494
01:18:57,929 --> 01:18:59,328
Hi.

1495
01:19:01,132 --> 01:19:03,794
I think I'm sitting on
something. Like this.

1496
01:19:03,868 --> 01:19:07,804
Hey, Em, it's me.
I desperately need a favor.

1497
01:19:07,872 --> 01:19:10,534
Here you go.
Don't cry.

1498
01:19:20,985 --> 01:19:22,043
Emma.

1499
01:19:22,119 --> 01:19:23,211
Hi, Nick.

1500
01:19:23,287 --> 01:19:24,515
What are
you doing here?

1501
01:19:24,589 --> 01:19:26,147
I have to take
you somewhere.

1502
01:19:26,224 --> 01:19:27,885
Excuse me?

1503
01:19:27,959 --> 01:19:30,086
Please, don't
make me explain.

1504
01:19:30,161 --> 01:19:32,721
So if you just get your
keys. We really have to go.

1505
01:19:32,797 --> 01:19:33,923
Emma.

1506
01:19:33,998 --> 01:19:35,397
Come on!

1507
01:19:35,466 --> 01:19:38,435
You're pulling our
legs. Collectively.

1508
01:19:38,503 --> 01:19:41,836
We absolutely have to begin in 3
minutes. Your guy better get here.

1509
01:19:41,906 --> 01:19:43,430
I promise
he'll be here.

1510
01:19:43,508 --> 01:19:45,942
He'll be here.
It's gonna be great.

1511
01:19:46,010 --> 01:19:48,137
I don't know what's
keeping him so long.

1512
01:19:48,212 --> 01:19:50,612
It'd be really fun
to have you back again.

1513
01:19:50,681 --> 01:19:53,514
When we come back,
"I'm So Over This,

1514
01:19:53,584 --> 01:19:56,451
What It's Really Like to Be
Pregnant. " So stick around.

1515
01:19:57,755 --> 01:19:59,552
I need four asses
in those seats now.

1516
01:19:59,624 --> 01:20:01,489
Oh, my God, Lisa.
What are we gonna do?

1517
01:20:01,559 --> 01:20:02,651
You're gonna go.

1518
01:20:02,727 --> 01:20:03,819
What?

1519
01:20:03,895 --> 01:20:05,021
I don't wanna go.

1520
01:20:06,931 --> 01:20:09,399
How are you?
Thank you. Loved the book.

1521
01:20:09,467 --> 01:20:13,563
Come on in. Hello,
little baby. Come on up.

1522
01:20:13,638 --> 01:20:14,969
Hi. Hello.

1523
01:20:15,039 --> 01:20:18,600
Wow, Laura.
What an amazing story.

1524
01:20:18,676 --> 01:20:21,839
I cannot believe that beautiful
baby was born at the DMV.

1525
01:20:21,913 --> 01:20:24,848
So Thea,
any kids?

1526
01:20:24,916 --> 01:20:26,907
No, never
been pregnant.

1527
01:20:26,984 --> 01:20:30,215
So why another pregnancy book?
Isn't the market a bit flooded?

1528
01:20:30,288 --> 01:20:32,222
Well, this
one's different.

1529
01:20:32,290 --> 01:20:36,386
It's not a how-to book or a
bunch of rules and recipes.

1530
01:20:36,460 --> 01:20:39,918
These stories are ultimately
about the birth of a new love.

1531
01:20:39,997 --> 01:20:41,191
We're late.

1532
01:20:41,265 --> 01:20:43,199
I can't believe she
booked with Vista.

1533
01:20:43,267 --> 01:20:45,758
It can be messy but in the
end you're much stronger

1534
01:20:45,836 --> 01:20:47,428
for having
gone through it.

1535
01:20:47,505 --> 01:20:50,770
Even if you did
something you may regret.

1536
01:20:50,841 --> 01:20:54,072
And to be honest,
I was just helping out.

1537
01:20:54,145 --> 01:20:58,479
You know, I shouldn't even really be
sitting up here. It was Nick Steinwald

1538
01:20:58,549 --> 01:21:00,676
who's sitting in
the audience right now.

1539
01:21:00,751 --> 01:21:02,685
He's responsible
for the whole thing.

1540
01:21:02,753 --> 01:21:06,484
He believed in the book
from the beginning and...

1541
01:21:06,557 --> 01:21:08,457
believed in me.

1542
01:21:08,526 --> 01:21:11,757
And I really can't thank
him enough for that.

1543
01:21:17,001 --> 01:21:18,798
Stand up!

1544
01:21:18,869 --> 01:21:21,201
Get him a mike.

1545
01:21:24,208 --> 01:21:27,803
She sings your praises. What is
about the book that appealed to you?

1546
01:21:27,878 --> 01:21:31,473
Um, well, uh...

1547
01:21:31,549 --> 01:21:35,315
I thought Suzie's book had a fresh
and funny perspective on pregnancy.

1548
01:21:35,386 --> 01:21:37,411
Thea was right when
she said it was a book

1549
01:21:37,488 --> 01:21:39,718
about how love can
see you through anything.

1550
01:21:42,526 --> 01:21:44,221
And how...

1551
01:21:44,295 --> 01:21:46,820
if you love someone,

1552
01:21:46,897 --> 01:21:50,924
you can forgive
them for all of the...

1553
01:21:51,002 --> 01:21:54,267
crazy and idiotic
things they do.

1554
01:21:54,338 --> 01:21:57,398
Because love
is a leap of faith.

1555
01:21:57,475 --> 01:22:00,103
And...

1556
01:22:00,177 --> 01:22:02,975
sometimes you just
have to jump.

1557
01:22:03,047 --> 01:22:05,447
Don't you?

1558
01:22:07,918 --> 01:22:11,183
Wow. Okay. I'm gonna
jump in here for a second

1559
01:22:11,255 --> 01:22:15,521
and, uh, thank you both so much.
Again, the book is "I'm So Over This,

1560
01:22:15,593 --> 01:22:17,925
What It's Really
Like to Be Pregnant. "

1561
01:22:17,995 --> 01:22:20,429
There's a link on
our website, TheVista. Com

1562
01:22:20,498 --> 01:22:23,524
One last thing, Nick. Do
you know how cute you are?

1563
01:22:23,601 --> 01:22:24,966
Uh, no.

1564
01:22:25,036 --> 01:22:26,970
No, he
doesn't, does he?

1565
01:22:27,038 --> 01:22:30,269
Okay, thank
you very much.

1566
01:22:49,994 --> 01:22:52,053
Hey. Guess what?

1567
01:22:52,129 --> 01:22:54,620
The producer said there's
been over 100,000 hits

1568
01:22:54,699 --> 01:22:57,930
on the show's link
to your book. Yeah.

1569
01:22:58,002 --> 01:22:58,991
That's fantastic.

1570
01:22:59,070 --> 01:23:00,230
Thanks, Claire.

1571
01:23:00,304 --> 01:23:01,703
Thank you.

1572
01:23:03,340 --> 01:23:05,001
Hey.

1573
01:23:06,377 --> 01:23:07,935
Thank you.

1574
01:23:08,012 --> 01:23:09,946
It's the least
I could do.

1575
01:23:10,014 --> 01:23:13,472
I meant what I said about
I can't thank you enough,

1576
01:23:13,551 --> 01:23:16,418
you know, now
that it's all over.

1577
01:23:16,487 --> 01:23:17,681
What's over?

1578
01:23:18,956 --> 01:23:20,651
Working together,

1579
01:23:20,725 --> 01:23:24,217
being together, just
togetherness in general.

1580
01:23:25,696 --> 01:23:27,493
It doesn't have to be.

1581
01:23:27,565 --> 01:23:30,432
We made a good book together.
We can make another one.

1582
01:23:30,501 --> 01:23:32,492
Would you
wanna do that?

1583
01:23:32,570 --> 01:23:34,868
Yes. Yes, I would.

1584
01:23:57,094 --> 01:23:58,755
Still feel backed up?

1585
01:23:58,829 --> 01:24:00,319
Thanks, Greg.

1586
01:24:00,397 --> 01:24:01,955
Should it
freak me out

1587
01:24:02,032 --> 01:24:04,364
that he knows more about
your bowels than I do?

1588
01:24:04,435 --> 01:24:06,027
Uh, maybe that's
a good thing.

1589
01:24:07,838 --> 01:24:10,432
If I've been timing these
right, and I'm sure I have,

1590
01:24:10,508 --> 01:24:13,568
you're up in ten,
nine, eight, seven...

1591
01:24:13,644 --> 01:24:15,111
Ow!

1592
01:24:15,179 --> 01:24:16,976
Yesl Just six
seconds off.

1593
01:24:17,047 --> 01:24:18,207
What I'd miss?

1594
01:24:18,282 --> 01:24:20,182
We're contracting
every half hour.

1595
01:24:20,251 --> 01:24:21,843
You okay?

1596
01:24:21,919 --> 01:24:24,410
We're gonna kick
this puppy out at 0900.

1597
01:24:24,488 --> 01:24:26,080
They should
head out now.

1598
01:24:26,157 --> 01:24:27,647
No one's
going anywhere

1599
01:24:27,725 --> 01:24:29,818
the doctor said to
wait until every 15...

1600
01:24:31,295 --> 01:24:33,058
Wait. You're way off.

1601
01:24:33,130 --> 01:24:34,995
That one was not good.

1602
01:24:35,065 --> 01:24:36,930
Jesus. She's
having a baby. Now!

1603
01:24:37,001 --> 01:24:38,298
What do you mean?

1604
01:24:38,369 --> 01:24:39,802
Okay. No, no, no.

1605
01:24:39,870 --> 01:24:41,633
What the hell
are we going to do?

1606
01:24:41,705 --> 01:24:43,036
Move! Move!

1607
01:24:43,107 --> 01:24:45,598
My baby got ten
on the APGAR scores

1608
01:24:45,676 --> 01:24:47,906
your baby's maybe
like a seven or a eight.

1609
01:24:47,978 --> 01:24:50,378
If it's a boy, feel
free to name him Carl.

1610
01:24:50,447 --> 01:24:52,278
I forgot. Okay.

1611
01:24:52,349 --> 01:24:53,873
Get the epidural.

1612
01:24:53,951 --> 01:24:55,942
Don't screw this up.

1613
01:24:56,020 --> 01:24:57,351
Are you ready?

1614
01:24:57,421 --> 01:24:58,718
Let's hope.

1615
01:24:58,789 --> 01:25:00,381
I Love you.

1616
01:25:00,457 --> 01:25:02,448
I love you, too.
It's your fault.

1617
01:25:02,526 --> 01:25:03,754
Semper Fi.

1618
01:25:03,828 --> 01:25:05,819
Push!
Oh, not yet.
