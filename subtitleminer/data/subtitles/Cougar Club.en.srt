00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:09,635
(rock music playing )

2
00:00:17,117 --> 00:00:21,952
Liberate me,
liberate me

3
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:27,483
Liberate me, liberate me...

4
00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:33,831
Around the sun

5
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,562
On the run

6
00:00:36,636 --> 00:00:40,094
Nothing can stop me...

7
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:42,073
- ( loud kissing )
- Man: You've got your whole life

8
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:43,370
- ahead of you.
- Woman: Yeah.

9
00:00:43,443 --> 00:00:45,741
- People you are still gonna meet.
- Woman: I know.

10
00:00:45,812 --> 00:00:48,303
Whole college experience
still in front of you.

11
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:55,546
- Woman: Mmm, you're right.
- Mmm.

12
00:00:55,622 --> 00:00:57,988
Woman: You promise
you're gonna write and call me?

13
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,424
Hogan! Man, what the hell
are you doing?

14
00:01:00,493 --> 00:01:02,757
- They're already on the Ds.
- ( Hogan groans )

15
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:06,196
- Mm-hmm. Shit.
- Mmm.

16
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:08,097
Hello, Professor Goodbey.

17
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:09,965
- ( moans )
- Come on.

18
00:01:10,036 --> 00:01:12,800
We gotta go.

19
00:01:12,872 --> 00:01:14,965
Gladys, I'm never
gonna forget you.

20
00:01:16,042 --> 00:01:18,101
- You're so hot.
- No no no.

21
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:19,543
All right. Sorry.

22
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:21,079
- I love you.
- I love you, Gladys.

23
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:23,581
Man over P.A.:
Rebecca Gephardt.

24
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:29,279
Indigo Goldstein.

25
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:31,755
Thank you very much, sir.

26
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:34,760
Liberate me...

27
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:36,955
Dag Griffiths.

28
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,930
Well done.

29
00:01:38,998 --> 00:01:40,989
- Hi!
- Hey.

30
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:44,093
- Oh, lip gloss.
- Man: Chris Grizma, magna cum laude.

31
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:45,762
( whispering )
Hey, where were you?

32
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:48,103
We were supposed
to take pictures before the ceremony!

33
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:51,337
- Moffy Gurner.
- I know. Uh... um...

34
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:54,141
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

35
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:56,182
- Cindy Guilley.
- Here.

36
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:57,910
Open it and put it on.

37
00:01:57,984 --> 00:02:01,317
Oh my God.
That is so sweet, Spence.

38
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:04,185
- Man: Rebecca Hartowicz.
- Oh.

39
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:05,781
- Oh...
- Man: Hello, Rebecca.

40
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:08,089
Let me see it.
( gasps )

41
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:11,130
- Oh...
- That's nice.

42
00:02:11,197 --> 00:02:12,994
Fuck off, Hogan!

43
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:16,502
- Marshall Hogan lll.
- That is my name. I must go.

44
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:18,594
Shit, I think I caught my dress.
Did I rip something?

45
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:20,696
- ( flatulence )
- Oh.

46
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:23,139
You're such an ingrate, Hogan!

47
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:25,541
Spencey, please meet me
in the quad

48
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:28,240
after the ceremony
for pictures with my family, okay?

49
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:31,249
This is the photo that will define us
for the rest of our lives--

50
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:33,478
where we met and fell in love.

51
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:36,619
- ( chuckles )
- ( giggles )

52
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:39,886
Spencer Holmes,
with honors.

53
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,553
Okay, I'll see you there.
I love you.

54
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:50,236
Mmm...

55
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:52,337
( moans )

56
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:57,573
Congratulations.

57
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:02,515
Ladies and gentlemen,
meet our business class graduates.

58
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:16,689
( sighs ) It's just not the same
as standing in the quad

59
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:18,993
- in our cap and gown.
- Oh, I'm sorry,

60
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:21,158
- but I had to take Hogan home.
- Mmm.

61
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:23,566
You know he has a problem
dumping in public bathrooms.

62
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:23,658
- Nice image, thanks.
- Okay, look.

63
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,901
We have a photo in front
of my childhood tree house

64
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:31,705
I built when I was nine.
Isn't that good enough?

65
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:36,340
- It's just not the same.
- ( sighs )

66
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:39,078
- Let's go get a drink.
- Okay.

67
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:42,087
- ( sighs )
- ( sighs )

68
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:46,219
Hey, can I get a beer

69
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:48,453
and a shot of tequila and a--

70
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:50,792
a thumb in the ass
for my girlfriend?

71
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:57,102
Look, all our problems revolve

72
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:00,071
around your geriatric-loving
loser creep of a friend.

73
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:02,004
And as soon as you outgrow him,
the sooner you'll be

74
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:05,875
- to reaching your potential.
- Just enough with Hogan, please.

75
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:08,243
No. No, Spencey.
If you spend the rest of your life

76
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:10,305
associating yourself
with that vermin,

77
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:12,248
you will become
that vermin.

78
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:14,377
Spencey-- hey, I love you,

79
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:16,422
I just want
what's best for you.

80
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:18,389
- I love you too. You know--
- Mmm...

81
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,585
( woman laughing )

82
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:24,786
Oh my God.
I'll be right back.

83
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:26,923
Just so you know,
he will not be in our wedding.

84
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:33,137
( laughing )

85
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:36,232
What is that young man
doing out there with Edith?

86
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:38,140
I never saw anybody dance like that.

87
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:41,305
Hey, are you sure they're dancing?

88
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:44,043
If they're not,
he owes me some fucking money!

89
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:48,479
- Hogan, what the hell are you doing?
- Spence!

90
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:51,352
- I'd like you to meet Edith Birnbaum.
- Spence!

91
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:55,758
Hello. Marshall here says
I'm the hottest chick at the party.

92
00:04:55,828 --> 00:04:58,092
- What do you think?
- Yeah.

93
00:04:58,164 --> 00:04:59,927
- Whoo!
- Hogan, I'm sorry.

94
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:01,933
- I gotta borrow him for one minute.
- Ooh.

95
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:04,697
- One second, we'll be right back.
- What?

96
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:06,602
Do you really think
it's wise to get all grindy

97
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:08,436
with our future boss's wife?

98
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:11,409
Dude, she is so fucking fine
and you know it!

99
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,274
Look at that little tush.
Look at her tushy.

100
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:16,804
- I don't understand you.
- Hey, how's the graduation boy doing?

101
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:18,817
Hey, all right.

102
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:20,477
Hey, thanks-- thanks
for the party, Dad.

103
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:22,646
Yeah, my pleasure, son.
My pleasure.

104
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:24,485
Yeah, Dad, thank you.
You really outdid yourself.

105
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:28,224
Just remember to mention
Stan Birnbaum in your speech today.

106
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:30,194
The guy never leaves
his frigging hospital.

107
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:32,697
He came out for your graduation
because he believes in you, son.

108
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:34,198
We'll get you at Yale Law in no time.

109
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:36,292
Stan, it's my boy right here!
Here he is!

110
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:40,271
Stan. Nobody is more connected
to Yale Law than Stan Birnbaum.

111
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,865
Thank you for putting in a good word
for me, by the way.

112
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:45,069
Mrs. Holmes is responsible
for that, Marshall.

113
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:47,339
Maybe you should talk to her.

114
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:49,540
- Don't forget, Spence.
- ( stomach grumbles )

115
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:51,515
( burps )

116
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:55,680
Guess I lost that bet
we had two years ago.

117
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:58,986
- What-- what bet?
- I bet you wouldn't graduate.

118
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:01,219
Oh, yeah? Oh.

119
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:03,421
- Okay.
- Now I have to show you my tits.

120
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:07,023
- Really? That's so great!
- Mm-hmm.

121
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,863
- Excuse me.
- Do you wanna touch them?

122
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:11,495
Yes. Oh!

123
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:14,039
Hi, sweet-- oh, hello.
Who's this pretty thing?

124
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:15,404
Casey Dixon.

125
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:18,137
Oh, aren't you just
the most charming girl?

126
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,441
It's nice to see you two
getting along so well.

127
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:22,447
Spencey, cake in 10 minutes.

128
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:26,110
Thanks, Mom.
Ahem, excuse me.

129
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:31,050
- Where's Hogan?
- Uh...

130
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:34,389
I don't know.

131
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,156
- ( feedback )
- Thank you all for being here today.

132
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:40,097
First, I'd like to take
this opportunity

133
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:43,966
to thank my parents for all
the love and support they've given me.

134
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:47,870
- I couldn't be more blessed.
- ( applauding )

135
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,636
I would also like to thank
my girlfriend Amanda

136
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,110
- for all the lov--
- Oh. Whoo-hoo!

137
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:56,910
- ( laughs )
- I'll begin work next week

138
00:06:56,983 --> 00:07:00,077
at Birnbaum, Arthur,
Hollace, Craft & Steel.

139
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:02,451
Uh, that's Birnbaum, Hollace,

140
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:04,854
- Arthur, Craft & Steel.
- ( laughing )

141
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:07,119
I'm sorry.
I should probably learn that.

142
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:10,754
In any case, I am very grateful
to you, Mr. Birnbaum,

143
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,731
and I look forward to working
for you and learning a great deal.

144
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,462
- ( Edith moaning )
- What can I say?

145
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:19,596
- I'm a very lucky man.
- ( wood groans )

146
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:22,641
- ( screams )
- ( all gasp )

147
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:30,311
- Amanda: Eww.
- ( murmuring )

148
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:33,443
- Woman: Oh my God.
- Man: Busted.

149
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:36,147
Uh...

150
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:38,622
- Sorry.
- ( clamoring )

151
00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:46,857
( pants )

152
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:54,532
- Well...
- You okay?

153
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:57,974
...I don't think I ever actually begged
a man before today.

154
00:07:58,044 --> 00:07:59,909
Well, what did Mr. Birnbaum say?

155
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:04,616
( choked )
I'm sorry, Spence, but, uh...

156
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:07,847
he will no longer require
your services at his firm.

157
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,013
( sighs )

158
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:13,650
What about me?
Would he require my services?

159
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:18,220
( yelling )

160
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:20,197
Dad! Dad.

161
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:27,205
- ( Mrs. Holmes sighs )
- ( grunts )

162
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:35,712
You know what, Dad?
It's okay, I got accepted into Baker.

163
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:37,248
- Maybe I should--
- Mr. Holmes: Nonsense!

164
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:38,806
No one's heard of Baker!

165
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:41,319
We are gonna solve this one.

166
00:08:41,387 --> 00:08:43,685
- Mm-hmm.
- There's a man at the club.

167
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:45,587
- Oh.
- Barry Stack is his name.

168
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:48,491
- He's an 18-holer, fine man.
- Uh-huh. Oh... Oh!

169
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:51,155
A Yalie and he's head
of the biggest divorce firm in LA.

170
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,755
- See?
- Not as connected as Birnbaum,

171
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:56,597
but that's okay.
I'll make a call on your behalf.

172
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:59,194
- Spence: Thanks, Dad.
- Yeah.

173
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:02,105
What about Marshall?

174
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:05,371
Well, he's practically family, Fred.

175
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:07,605
And I'm sure he's very sorry
for what happened, aren't you, dear?

176
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,275
Yes, I am. I really--
I truly am, ma'am-- Mom.

177
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:14,751
Come on, Dad.
Give him another chance.

178
00:09:17,356 --> 00:09:19,221
- Fine.
- Spence: Yes.

179
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:22,261
- Oh.
- Fine fine fine. If he screws this up,

180
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:23,795
- he's our punter this month.
- No problem.

181
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:28,323
And for you, son, I would be
disappointed beyond repair.

182
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,369
- ( stomach rumbling )
- ( burping )

183
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:32,404
- Spence: Dad.
- Oh!

184
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:34,564
Excuse me.

185
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:37,768
- Yes, sir.
- Oh...

186
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:43,747
( woman giggles )

187
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:51,946
( sighs )
I'll try Mr. Stack again, all right?

188
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:55,256
Oh, nice.

189
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:58,764
Oh... nice.

190
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:00,458
Beautiful.

191
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:01,932
Good. Good good good.

192
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:04,265
Woman over intercom:
Mr. Stack, your interview is here.

193
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:06,134
I'm coming.

194
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:11,276
- He'll be right out.
- Thank you.

195
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:12,834
Thanks.

196
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:15,972
You look so...
refreshing today.

197
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:18,346
And the flower
is a very sweet touch.

198
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:19,714
You look lovely.

199
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:23,121
Stop.

200
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:29,460
( grunts )

201
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:31,519
Oh!

202
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:37,527
You're so fucking good-looking.

203
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:43,141
( grunts )
Ahh.

204
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:46,178
( snorting )

205
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:55,845
- What was that?
- I don't know.

206
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:58,389
- ( club thunks )
- ( metal clangs )

207
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:02,052
- ( woman screams )
- ( panting )

208
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:11,260
Why the hell are you two
just sitting there?

209
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,703
Us?

210
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:17,231
- Did you pass the bar yet?
- Haven't been to law school yet, sir.

211
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:19,573
"Oh, we haven't been
to law school yet, sir."

212
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:22,546
So you're just
a couple of shit turds.

213
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:25,015
- Excuse me?
- Yes, sir, we are.

214
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:28,178
- Do you shit turds wanna work here?
- Both: Yes, sir.

215
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:30,984
Well, then, why am l...

216
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:34,618
Iooking for my ball
and you're just sitting in there?!

217
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:39,531
And you!

218
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:43,227
Those plants--
they need dusting.

219
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:46,465
- Plants?
- Uh, dusting?

220
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,007
Good. Good good good.

221
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:52,067
You're hired, you're hired,
you're all fucking hired!

222
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:54,374
- ( Archibald laughing )
- Woman: He forgets sometimes

223
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:56,813
he hired me over 15 years ago.

224
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,679
Oh.

225
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:02,152
- Is that Mr. Stack?
- Oh, no. That was Mr. Archibald.

226
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:05,713
But don't worry, he has hiring
and firing privileges too.

227
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:08,487
I'll show you where we keep
the plant maintenance kit.

228
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:12,560
Don't they have plant maintenance
people for stuff like that?

229
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:14,963
Oops. They only come
once a week.

230
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:17,468
Mr. Archibald
likes it done twice.

231
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:20,664
It's okay.
Once you make partner

232
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,731
you won't have to do it anymore.

233
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:26,701
Woman over radio:
Good morning, Angelenos.

234
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:28,076
- ( clock beeping )
- It's gonna be a hot,

235
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:30,342
muggy one out there today,
busting up to the century mark.

236
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:33,943
And on to the news.
The stock market is up 12 points

237
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:37,887
and, in sports, the LA Cougars
won the WABA Championship

238
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:39,925
- by 16 points.
- ( meows )

239
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:43,086
And in entertainment news,
it says here a '60s sex symbol...

240
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:46,529
- ( beeping continues )
- Spence, would you get that?

241
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,533
...on Pacific Coast Highway.
That's right, that's what it says.

242
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,404
( grunts )

243
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:55,599
You bar-flunking freak!

244
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:58,006
Where in the hell
did you get these numbers?

245
00:12:58,077 --> 00:13:00,045
I don't know.

246
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,614
( whispers )
It's that Karl guy.

247
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:05,582
( whispering )
You know what I heard?

248
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:08,620
The poor bastard fucks
the file cabinets to blow off steam.

249
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:11,281
You butt-licker!

250
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:15,623
What part of your maggot-rotten brain
shit out these numbers?

251
00:13:15,694 --> 00:13:18,424
- Well, obviously, I made a mistake.
- Well, obviously.

252
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:22,524
And now Sarah Tucker's alimony
is on the line!

253
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:24,865
Better fix it--
best piece of ass I've ever had.

254
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:27,963
- ( licks )
- Did you hear that?

255
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,338
The best piece of ass
he's ever had.

256
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:32,468
Who brought you in here, anyway?

257
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:35,946
Well, my Uncle William is
a good friend of Mr. Conrad.

258
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:39,678
Well, that's not gonna save you
when you flunk the bar next month,

259
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:42,812
because next month
you're gonna be good and fired.

260
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:45,755
- I hope not.
- Good and fired!

261
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:50,896
Karl, do you need to use the bathroom
or did you already shit in your pants?

262
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:54,127
I might have
dripped a little, but, umm--

263
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:58,034
It wasn't a real question,
you taint-licking hemorrhoid.

264
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:02,833
- ( crying )
- These guys are fuckers.

265
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:08,205
I gotta go get the file boxes.

266
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:12,217
Loosen up, would you?

267
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:18,123
( whimpering loudly )

268
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:22,058
( ballad playing )

269
00:14:37,743 --> 00:14:40,371
Hi.

270
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:42,414
( gasps )

271
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:45,746
- Are you gay?
- What?

272
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:47,843
No.

273
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,514
No...

274
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:52,523
Whoa, big fella. Down.

275
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:54,115
It's not polite to point
in the office.

276
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:57,454
Gonna plant that mushroom?

277
00:14:57,529 --> 00:15:00,521
A little young for me, but--
oh, for you...

278
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:02,396
( chuckles )

279
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:05,904
I have-- I have to get
the file boxes.

280
00:15:05,971 --> 00:15:08,098
- Okay.
- Okay. Take care of some business

281
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:09,970
- while you're in there.
- Okay.

282
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:11,907
I'm gonna push out
a little turtle head.

283
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:13,706
- I'll meet you back in there.
- All right.

284
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:17,044
Hey hey hey!
You two-- shit-turd guys--

285
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:21,052
get in here and get
the jelly out of my toes.

286
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,089
- Uh...
- Mmm, mmm.

287
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:26,886
I want you to really get in there--
under the nail.

288
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,928
And give us a nice trim
while you're down there.

289
00:15:32,564 --> 00:15:33,758
( phone beeps )

290
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:35,265
Stack:
What's going on with Doreen Wyes?

291
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:38,667
- I gave you that lead a week ago.
- I'm on it, I'm sending an employee

292
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:40,762
over to Formosa
Wednesday at 6:00,

293
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:43,433
'cause that's where her husband
meets his girlfriend.

294
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:45,841
Stack: Took you a fucking week
to figure that out?!

295
00:15:45,911 --> 00:15:48,573
There was some confusion
about which restaurant.

296
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:51,548
Whatever.
Send someone fucking good this time.

297
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:54,743
( phone beeps )

298
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,755
- Ouch!
- Sorry. Sorry.

299
00:15:57,823 --> 00:16:01,350
I-- I didn't know this was
part of your body.

300
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:03,691
( retches )

301
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:08,098
Oh, that's good, that's good.
That's good, that's good.

302
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:11,432
Oh...
( chuckles )

303
00:16:11,503 --> 00:16:13,994
Uh, anything else, sir?

304
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:16,303
Yeah yeah, there is.

305
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:19,708
I got to this little piece
of dried-up shit turd

306
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:22,645
that needs to be pulled
out of my ass.

307
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:25,582
Come on.
( laughing )

308
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:28,347
I'm kidding you!

309
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:33,553
- Get out.
- ( retches )

310
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:41,124
Dude, these lawyers...

311
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,168
( chuckles )
are a bunch of sweaty jackals,

312
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:45,897
feeding off
of the weak and sick

313
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:47,962
and injured little gazelles and shit.

314
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,066
I mean, do you really want
one of these... scavengers

315
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:54,010
- referring you to Yale?
- Right now,

316
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,172
it's the best contact I have,

317
00:16:56,248 --> 00:17:00,150
but there's no reason
you should stay here.

318
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:02,244
Where the hell am I gonna go?

319
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:04,846
Go wherever you want.

320
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:09,326
Spence, now you know
I can't stand

321
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:12,193
anyone that isn't
a hot older woman or you.

322
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:14,755
- ( chuckles )
- So wherever you go, I follow.

323
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,994
This may sound
a little weak, lame,

324
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:19,435
- even a little gay to some people...
- Yeah.

325
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:21,905
...but fuck it.
I know what I like.

326
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:25,735
- Hogan.
- All right.

327
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:29,504
Let's get you in Yale.

328
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:32,209
Archibald: Karl!

329
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:34,275
Out of my office, butt-licker!

330
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:41,092
Hey, shit turd!

331
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,391
Grab your shit-turd friend
and get in here.

332
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:46,431
( laughing )

333
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:50,602
Hogan!

334
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:04,072
Hey!

335
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:14,758
Silver BMW 535--
it's in the parking lot

336
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:18,126
in the golf club in Bel Air.
Here's the license plate.

337
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:20,665
Find it and slash the tires.

338
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:23,098
Go. Now.

339
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:25,033
Isn't that illegal?

340
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,072
( laughs )

341
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,231
Okay. No, I know
that it's illegal,

342
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:33,608
but why would you want us
to do something illegal?

343
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,943
Hogan:
My guess would be

344
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:38,505
that the driver has
an afternoon court appearance

345
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:40,575
that if he were to miss

346
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:43,280
would cause him to severely fall
out of favor with the judge,

347
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:46,654
considering that
it's probably over custody

348
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:49,660
or some sticky issue like that.
The judge will look more favorably

349
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:54,529
on the party that is actually in
the courtroom standing in front of him.

350
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,160
Very good, shit-turd's friend.

351
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:02,096
Now, when you're done with that,
you deliver these papers to my wife.

352
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:04,768
She's at some bake sale
with her girlfriends.

353
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:07,539
The address is on the envelope.
Tell her she can have her divorce

354
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:10,013
as long as she understands
that she's now...

355
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:12,516
totally fucked.
Tell her that--

356
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:15,109
- verbatim.
- Yes, sir.

357
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:17,348
You're still here. Why?

358
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:35,339
Dude, these guys make
so much fucking bank here.

359
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:36,874
- Wow.
- I'm quitting my job.

360
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:38,910
Man:
Hey, assholes.

361
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:42,472
I've been rotting here
for five minutes.

362
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:46,143
I don't wanna put you out or anything,
but do you mind fetching my car?!

363
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:49,210
( Slavic accent )
"Studman." Studman!

364
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:51,222
Of course, we help you.

365
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:54,316
- I run for studs.
- ( whispers ) What do we do?

366
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:56,657
( whispers ) I don't know.
A couple of things feel good to me.

367
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:58,696
Okay, I go fast
for you now.

368
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:00,891
A couple jerk-off
valet parkers.

369
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:02,934
So listen, I changed
at the country club

370
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:05,162
and I'll be in court
within the hour.

371
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:07,262
What the fuck
are you looking at?

372
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:09,034
Que?

373
00:20:09,107 --> 00:20:11,905
Just some valet puke
giving me the stinkeye.

374
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:13,604
Guy's a moron.

375
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,671
So listen, wrap up the Chicago deal,
let's get to Vegas.

376
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:19,774
Yeah, I've got the four tee times
and strippers lined up.

377
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:22,615
No, I'm not bringing my wife.
What are you talking about?

378
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:24,679
She starting to take me
to the cleaners in this divorce.

379
00:20:24,756 --> 00:20:26,883
No, I'm thinking of taking
that cute little court reporter

380
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:28,950
from the Stony case.
She was pretty good orally,

381
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:30,756
- but I tell you...
- ( car tires screeching )

382
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:33,389
...she had a snatch the size
of the Lincoln Tunnel.

383
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:36,229
It's like fucking
a warm bucket of water.

384
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:38,326
No, but I'll give you five...

385
00:20:40,939 --> 00:20:43,066
Wha-- what the fuck?

386
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:45,268
( normal voice )
It's a little sticky

387
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:47,312
coming out of second,
but other than that--

388
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:48,937
I'm gonna kick your face in!

389
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:51,244
Hogan, holy shit, man!
Come on, let's go!

390
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:53,250
- Come on, go go go go go!
- Ah!

391
00:20:53,318 --> 00:20:55,479
You son of a bitch!

392
00:20:57,322 --> 00:20:59,313
That was crazy, Hogan.

393
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:02,224
I think maybe you took
that one a little too far, huh?

394
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:04,888
( Slavic accent )
What? You have job, you do it right.

395
00:21:04,963 --> 00:21:06,430
- Okay.
- Huh?

396
00:21:06,498 --> 00:21:08,125
This is it.

397
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,997
Whoa.

398
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:12,263
Gotta work on
your accent, by the way.

399
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:14,271
- Really?
- It was terrible.

400
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:16,671
I told you to prepare, you're not--
you're not getting prepared.

401
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:19,233
- Weird, I thought I was pretty good.
- You almost blew it.

402
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:20,869
Hmm.

403
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:27,145
- Come in.
- ( women chatting )

404
00:21:34,826 --> 00:21:37,989
Woman:
I'm sure you will enjoy these.

405
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:40,327
They come
in all different kinds.

406
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:42,526
They're like Easter eggs.

407
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:45,365
And it will go
with anything you're wearing...

408
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:48,304
or not wearing.

409
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:51,809
This one, my little darlings,
is called "The Fire Alarm."

410
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:55,278
And trust me,
where your orgasms are concerned--

411
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:58,373
all of you--
this one is the four-alarm fire

412
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:00,509
that you have
been begging for.

413
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:03,315
( laughs )
Look at it. Isn't it cute?

414
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:06,118
Feliney metropolitanis.

415
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:07,317
What?

416
00:22:07,392 --> 00:22:09,622
Cougars.
Everywhere.

417
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:12,630
Oh my God,
look at the variety.

418
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:16,634
Oh my, that's a Rolls-Royce,
very hard to nab.

419
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:18,192
...spankings!

420
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,670
There's some Cadillacs,
a little bit easier.

421
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:22,366
Oh my God, a Trans Am.

422
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:25,672
Not exactly my flavor,
but definitely has appeal.

423
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:28,212
Oh my God.
My personal favorite,

424
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:32,216
a Silver Fox. Oh, so many
possibilities in one sitting.

425
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:33,410
Down.

426
00:22:33,485 --> 00:22:36,010
Thank you very much.

427
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:38,522
We'll have some refreshments.

428
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:44,919
Woman:
This is a private party,

429
00:22:44,996 --> 00:22:48,659
but what can I do
for you two hunky hunks?

430
00:22:48,734 --> 00:22:53,034
We are Spence Holmes
and Marshall Hogan lll,

431
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:56,836
and we're looking
for a Daniela Stack.

432
00:22:56,908 --> 00:22:59,240
Woman:
And what is this regarding?

433
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:02,178
Well, we work
for her husband and...

434
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:05,182
he wanted us to...

435
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,877
give her this.

436
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:10,183
Oh. Oh, then you work
for my husband too.

437
00:23:10,255 --> 00:23:11,882
I'm Teddy Archibald.

438
00:23:11,957 --> 00:23:15,393
- No way.
- No way.

439
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,451
So...

440
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:20,521
what exactly goes on
at this sort of party?

441
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:23,397
Well, we're just looking to spice up
our libidos a little bit.

442
00:23:23,468 --> 00:23:25,732
Aha. Yeah, I see. I see.

443
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:29,205
Edith: Marshall!
What a pleasant surprise!

444
00:23:29,274 --> 00:23:30,798
Oh, hey.

445
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:32,241
Oh.

446
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:35,973
Ladies, meet Marshall Hogan lll.

447
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:38,982
Our spectacular afternoon together

448
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:41,450
became my inspiration

449
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,080
for finding Lulu here

450
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:46,488
and her "Art of Pleasure" schooling.

451
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:48,617
Praise the clitoris, Edith.

452
00:23:48,693 --> 00:23:50,285
Yes!

453
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:53,923
I came alive under
Mr. Hogan's tutelage,

454
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:55,830
and my life's mission

455
00:23:55,901 --> 00:23:58,461
is to help you experience

456
00:23:58,537 --> 00:24:00,437
an awakening such as mine.

457
00:24:00,505 --> 00:24:03,963
Aside from handling me so expertly,

458
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:07,443
he suggested I switch
to the Vivelle Dot

459
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:09,776
hormone replacement therapy.

460
00:24:09,848 --> 00:24:11,611
And I must say

461
00:24:11,683 --> 00:24:14,743
it's worked wonders.

462
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,788
Wonders!

463
00:24:18,356 --> 00:24:20,483
Whoo!

464
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:23,323
Marshall.

465
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:26,853
Perhaps you and your friend

466
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:29,560
can help us out?

467
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:32,962
Oh, anything.

468
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:35,598
Well, maybe...

469
00:24:35,674 --> 00:24:38,768
you could gather a group
of your friends

470
00:24:38,844 --> 00:24:41,540
who enjoy doing
what you enjoy doing,

471
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:45,640
and we could connect them

472
00:24:45,717 --> 00:24:47,878
with my friends

473
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:51,252
who enjoy doing
what I enjoy doing.

474
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:03,033
Sounds like the cougars
need their prey.

475
00:25:03,101 --> 00:25:04,796
Ooh, well said.

476
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:06,701
We'll be in touch.

477
00:25:06,771 --> 00:25:08,898
Now, ladies,

478
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:11,204
Lulu will take
your orders here.

479
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:13,676
Grab a clipboard.

480
00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:17,506
Cindy Conrad,

481
00:25:17,582 --> 00:25:19,914
Iet me formally introduce you

482
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:19,985
to Spence Holmes
and Marshall Hogan.

483
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:22,180
to Spence Holmes
and Marshall Hogan.

484
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:22,254
They work for the firm.

485
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:24,313
They work for the firm.

486
00:25:24,389 --> 00:25:24,389
Ah. So you know that
ass-waxing prick that I'm married to.

487
00:25:24,389 --> 00:25:27,358
Ah. So you know that
ass-waxing prick that I'm married to.

488
00:25:27,425 --> 00:25:27,425
( all laugh )

489
00:25:27,425 --> 00:25:29,256
( all laugh )

490
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:29,327
Have you seen Daniela around?

491
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:30,988
Have you seen Daniela around?

492
00:25:31,062 --> 00:25:31,062
They have something for her.

493
00:25:31,062 --> 00:25:33,360
They have something for her.

494
00:25:33,431 --> 00:25:33,431
Oh yeah, I dragged her here.
She's inside somewhere.

495
00:25:33,431 --> 00:25:35,922
Oh yeah, I dragged her here.
She's inside somewhere.

496
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:36,001
Mmm, happy birthday to me.

497
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:38,834
Mmm, happy birthday to me.

498
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:43,364
If you want,
I could give the papers to Daniela.

499
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:46,308
That's okay, Teddy.
I'll take them.

500
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:01,625
Oops.

501
00:26:05,163 --> 00:26:07,631
I assume he finally signed
my divorce papers?

502
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:10,896
Yeah, um...

503
00:26:10,969 --> 00:26:13,631
and he-- he also said--

504
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:16,003
he said he wanted us to say...

505
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:19,636
well, 'cause he wanted to--

506
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:21,406
Hello, Marshall Hogan lll.

507
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:24,039
It's nice to see you again.
And may I say

508
00:26:24,115 --> 00:26:26,777
you deserve a future
of lasting happiness and peace?

509
00:26:26,851 --> 00:26:28,819
And may I also say
you've probably never

510
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:30,752
Iooked or felt better in your life,

511
00:26:30,822 --> 00:26:32,119
am I right?

512
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:34,818
- ( laughs )
- Daniela Stack,

513
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:37,657
this is my best friend,
Spencer Holmes.

514
00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:39,663
Hi.

515
00:26:39,731 --> 00:26:41,995
Daniela Darren now.

516
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:43,500
Nice to meet you.

517
00:26:43,568 --> 00:26:46,128
Hi.

518
00:26:46,204 --> 00:26:49,401
Hogan:
Our job is done here,

519
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:54,002
and we hope
to see you again.

520
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:56,673
I hope so.

521
00:26:56,748 --> 00:26:58,648
Hi.

522
00:27:00,218 --> 00:27:02,186
Stop saying hi.

523
00:27:03,688 --> 00:27:05,622
- Hi.
- You're dehydrated.

524
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:07,658
Bye.

525
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:12,354
Hi.

526
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:22,199
I mean,

527
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:26,935
she just looked
right at me and said,

528
00:27:27,012 --> 00:27:29,503
"l hope so."

529
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:32,641
Oh my God.
What am I gonna do?

530
00:27:32,717 --> 00:27:34,207
You know what you're gonna do?

531
00:27:34,285 --> 00:27:36,219
Whatever the fuck you want.

532
00:27:36,287 --> 00:27:38,448
Now, you want to be with this woman,
be with this woman.

533
00:27:38,523 --> 00:27:40,855
Be with her and Amanda, who cares?
Be with all of 'em.

534
00:27:40,925 --> 00:27:43,120
Yeah, Stack too.
Fuck him...

535
00:27:43,194 --> 00:27:45,162
good and hard,
right up the ass.

536
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:46,697
Just fuckin' do what you want.

537
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:48,699
- I tell you what else you're gonna do.
- What?

538
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:50,325
This Edith thing.

539
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:53,064
Dude, right now my whole life
revolves around Yale Law.

540
00:27:53,138 --> 00:27:55,038
I know,
and you're going to Yale Law.

541
00:27:55,106 --> 00:27:56,698
Okay, I have no doubt
about that.

542
00:27:56,775 --> 00:27:59,539
But that's, like, the future.
I'm talking now,

543
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:02,409
- and you're doing this Edith thing.
- What are you talking about?

544
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,004
Edith!

545
00:28:04,082 --> 00:28:05,879
Edith and the cougars!

546
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:07,815
What?

547
00:28:07,886 --> 00:28:11,879
Wait, you want us to charge them
to have sex with us?

548
00:28:11,956 --> 00:28:13,651
No.

549
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:15,522
No.

550
00:28:15,593 --> 00:28:20,257
We charge our friends
to have sex with them.

551
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:21,821
- All right.
- You see?

552
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:24,198
Now listen.
We start a little country club, okay?

553
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:26,533
A "Cougar Club," if you will, right?

554
00:28:26,604 --> 00:28:29,334
And we charge membership fees
and shit like that.

555
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:31,568
- Is that legal?
- Fuck it-- yes!

556
00:28:31,643 --> 00:28:34,237
I don't know.
Who cares?

557
00:28:34,312 --> 00:28:36,542
I care! I have to.

558
00:28:36,614 --> 00:28:39,742
I, uh, no.

559
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:41,718
- No no no no no, I can't do it.
- Oh...

560
00:28:41,786 --> 00:28:44,550
- "Cougar Club."
- Oh come, Spence, would you stop

561
00:28:44,622 --> 00:28:46,715
saying no to everything?

562
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:49,919
Do you not get bored of that?
Say "yes."

563
00:28:49,994 --> 00:28:53,020
Yes, 'cause it feels so good.

564
00:28:53,098 --> 00:28:56,932
Yes, because you've never
taken a risk in your life, my friend.

565
00:28:57,001 --> 00:28:59,299
Yes, because
Daniela Darren said,

566
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:01,600
"l hope so"!

567
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:04,233
Yes, because Edith Birnbaum
fucking demands it.

568
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:06,743
"Supply us nice, horny cougars

569
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:10,247
with nice, horny young prey."

570
00:29:10,315 --> 00:29:13,409
Aw, shit.
Why can't I ever say yes to you?

571
00:29:13,485 --> 00:29:18,218
Because sometimes Spencey
says "no" when he means "yes."

572
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:20,587
Thank you, Mom.

573
00:29:20,658 --> 00:29:22,592
Thanks, Mom.

574
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,890
Okay, well... night.

575
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:26,954
- Spence: Good night.
- Hogan: Good night.

576
00:29:27,031 --> 00:29:29,591
Mmm!

577
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:35,601
"Because sometimes Spencey
says 'no' when he means 'yes."'

578
00:29:35,673 --> 00:29:38,938
- That was a fucking omen.
- Okay okay, shut up.

579
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:42,138
For once in your life,
would you do something just for you?

580
00:29:42,213 --> 00:29:46,411
Say what you really want to say.

581
00:29:46,484 --> 00:29:49,510
How will it work?

582
00:29:50,588 --> 00:29:53,113
Hogan's voice:
We'll target 100 guys to start.

583
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:56,319
That first group will pay $500
for the first year to join,

584
00:29:56,394 --> 00:29:58,760
and any members
after that will pay $1,000.

585
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:02,664
They'll have direct access
of all our cougar-sponsored events.

586
00:30:02,734 --> 00:30:06,830
Now that includes access to profiles,
phone numbers-- whole thing.

587
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:09,339
And on the women's side,
Edith will be out in the wild

588
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:13,673
gathering our hunters, marking them
with the gold Cougar Club necklace.

589
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:16,839
All of our picks will
be those who strive to be with

590
00:30:16,915 --> 00:30:19,850
and who embrace
the older woman, or the cougar.

591
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:24,287
And finally, we'll save room
for our one "must join."

592
00:30:24,355 --> 00:30:28,223
You tell me when, okay?
You tell me when!

593
00:30:28,293 --> 00:30:31,660
You-you tell me when.

594
00:30:31,729 --> 00:30:34,892
Want a whole dance, do ya?

595
00:30:34,966 --> 00:30:37,059
You want a whole d--

596
00:30:37,135 --> 00:30:39,865
ahh! You're looking right at me.

597
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:42,634
( cabinet squeaking )

598
00:30:42,707 --> 00:30:45,267
Karl? Karl, Karl.

599
00:30:48,546 --> 00:30:50,844
How long has this disaster
been going on, man?

600
00:30:50,915 --> 00:30:53,315
- Too long.
- Spence: Mmm.

601
00:30:53,384 --> 00:30:55,716
We're concerned, Karl.

602
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:58,813
Yeah. And we--
we understand your need here.

603
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:02,257
We do, it's just maybe you
and your little plastic friend

604
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:04,659
would like to bang
something other than the files?

605
00:31:04,729 --> 00:31:05,855
Like what?

606
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:07,363
- Like a woman...
- Yeah.

607
00:31:07,432 --> 00:31:08,660
...for God's sakes.

608
00:31:08,733 --> 00:31:11,998
( snickers )
Yeah right.

609
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:14,265
Not just any woman-- no.

610
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:16,398
Larry Archibald's woman.

611
00:31:16,474 --> 00:31:20,035
- His mistress?
- No, dude, his wife.

612
00:31:20,111 --> 00:31:22,944
We're starting a cougar club

613
00:31:23,014 --> 00:31:24,914
for guys just like you,

614
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:27,713
and we want you
to be a member.

615
00:31:27,785 --> 00:31:29,218
You do?

616
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:31,016
Yeah.

617
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:33,717
Now, it's 500 bucks to join,

618
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:35,952
but it's well worth all the access
you're gonna have

619
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:39,053
not only to Archibald's wife,
but all the other wives

620
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:41,189
and the cougar friends
they're gonna bring with them.

621
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:43,757
Yeah, but $500-- that's--

622
00:31:43,835 --> 00:31:46,929
I mean, God, l...

623
00:31:49,007 --> 00:31:51,271
Okay, you know what?
Yes, please.

624
00:31:51,342 --> 00:31:53,572
Yes, I'll-- yeah, all right.

625
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:55,670
What's a cougar?

626
00:31:57,882 --> 00:31:59,873
- We'll explain later.
- Yeah.

627
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:03,250
Clean yourself up.
We'll explain it to you.

628
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:05,653
Here you go.
Congratulations.

629
00:32:05,723 --> 00:32:07,315
Thank you.

630
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:11,961
Here you go.

631
00:32:13,965 --> 00:32:16,763
All right, man,
welcome to the club.

632
00:32:16,834 --> 00:32:19,359
- Oh thanks.
- Whoa, you're hot.

633
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:26,003
All right,
welcome to the club.

634
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:28,477
All right.

635
00:32:28,546 --> 00:32:32,744
Okay, welcome to Cougar Club.

636
00:32:32,817 --> 00:32:34,648
( all cheer )

637
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:39,088
All right, now, all of your credit cards
will be swiped

638
00:32:39,157 --> 00:32:41,921
at every event to ensure
that all payments

639
00:32:41,993 --> 00:32:44,154
have been received.
If they're not,

640
00:32:44,228 --> 00:32:47,425
you will have the opportunity to make
these payments at the event.

641
00:32:47,498 --> 00:32:50,626
Now, for a little taste

642
00:32:50,702 --> 00:32:53,694
of what your new membership's
gonna bring you.

643
00:32:55,273 --> 00:32:57,434
Mmm!

644
00:32:57,508 --> 00:32:59,942
( man grunts )

645
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:03,447
Yeah, this little sweetie's
name is lngrid Stone,

646
00:33:03,514 --> 00:33:05,846
subcategory: Ferrari.

647
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:08,147
She's a divorcée,

648
00:33:08,219 --> 00:33:11,154
working at one
of LA's finest financial firms,

649
00:33:11,222 --> 00:33:15,215
and she enjoys the headrush
she gets from a vertical 69.

650
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:16,851
( all chuckle )

651
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:22,991
( sighs )
So, gentlemen,

652
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:25,695
Iet the hunt begin.

653
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:28,034
( all cheer )

654
00:33:31,609 --> 00:33:32,075
( Dolly moaning )

655
00:33:34,979 --> 00:33:37,209
Hogan:
Dolly.

656
00:33:37,281 --> 00:33:40,148
- Oh God, oh...
- ( Dolly squealing )

657
00:33:40,218 --> 00:33:44,177
- Sorry, Dolly.
- Don't fuckin' stop!

658
00:33:45,723 --> 00:33:49,250
Hey, shit turd,
meet me in my office.

659
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:51,989
Shouldn't I clean
the bathrooms first?

660
00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:55,032
Stack:
You heard me. Get in here!

661
00:33:55,099 --> 00:33:59,559
So why are you
working at this firm,

662
00:33:59,637 --> 00:34:01,571
shit turd?

663
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:04,574
Can you please stop
calling me "shit turd"?

664
00:34:04,642 --> 00:34:06,906
Mmm.

665
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:10,072
Why are you here...

666
00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:12,742
shit turd?

667
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:17,516
I want real-world experience
before I attend law school.

668
00:34:17,588 --> 00:34:20,523
Well, most people go straight
to law school. Why didn't you?

669
00:34:20,591 --> 00:34:24,391
Well, I was accepted to Baker
and Anderson Lee--

670
00:34:24,462 --> 00:34:26,020
- Never heard of 'em.
- Right right.

671
00:34:26,097 --> 00:34:28,861
And what school
weren't you accepted to?

672
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:31,299
Well, that would be Yale, sir.

673
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:34,270
Now you see?
That one I've heard of.

674
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:36,533
So when I asked you
why you were here,

675
00:34:36,607 --> 00:34:38,541
you didn't tell me
the truth, did you?

676
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:40,042
Oh.

677
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:42,443
The truth is you're here

678
00:34:42,513 --> 00:34:45,812
because you need me to give you
a recommendation letter

679
00:34:45,883 --> 00:34:48,545
to guarantee you
acceptance into Yale.

680
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:51,452
You're here because you're
too stupid to get in on your own,

681
00:34:51,522 --> 00:34:55,288
and you need me
to help do it for you.

682
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:59,056
Now it seems
your dear old dad

683
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:03,066
is on his hands and knees
ready to blow

684
00:35:03,134 --> 00:35:06,069
to make sure his shit turd
of a son gets into Yale.

685
00:35:06,137 --> 00:35:11,006
Now what do you think
I should tell dear old Dad?

686
00:35:14,345 --> 00:35:16,279
I don't know.

687
00:35:16,347 --> 00:35:18,508
Well, I think you should tell him

688
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:20,676
that you're my bitch.

689
00:35:20,751 --> 00:35:23,777
And maybe if you do
everything I tell you,

690
00:35:23,855 --> 00:35:27,985
your shit-turd ass might
wind up in Yale.

691
00:35:30,895 --> 00:35:34,763
Who authorized you
to change the locks to my house?

692
00:35:34,832 --> 00:35:37,426
You did.
Read the pre-nup, sugar.

693
00:35:37,502 --> 00:35:39,834
You know I still have
my things in there, don't you?

694
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:42,099
Look, if you can't read the pre-nup,

695
00:35:42,173 --> 00:35:46,109
why don't you have your lawyer
or some hack read it for you?

696
00:35:46,177 --> 00:35:48,645
Or if you want to make it
easy on yourself,

697
00:35:48,713 --> 00:35:51,648
just stay married to me.

698
00:35:51,716 --> 00:35:53,650
I'd rather be dead.

699
00:35:53,718 --> 00:35:56,482
And by the way,

700
00:35:56,554 --> 00:35:58,215
this box of lingerie...

701
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:02,282
not mine,

702
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:05,659
you son of a bitch.

703
00:36:10,401 --> 00:36:12,369
( Stack sniffs )

704
00:36:13,905 --> 00:36:17,170
Don't you have
a toilet bowl to lick dry?

705
00:36:17,241 --> 00:36:19,607
Yeah. Yup.

706
00:36:29,787 --> 00:36:33,154
- Dolly: Are you okay?
- Go. Go.

707
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:34,851
Go go.

708
00:36:36,994 --> 00:36:38,825
Dolly:
What's-- what's going on?

709
00:36:38,896 --> 00:36:40,693
( car alarm beeps )

710
00:36:43,568 --> 00:36:46,560
Hey. Hi.

711
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:49,829
What you did
back there was...

712
00:36:49,907 --> 00:36:52,501
was good.
It was really good,

713
00:36:52,577 --> 00:36:56,172
and I just want you
to know that...

714
00:36:56,247 --> 00:36:58,340
if you need
a place to stay,

715
00:36:58,416 --> 00:37:01,715
you can stay at my house.
Let me give you my number.

716
00:37:01,786 --> 00:37:05,187
That's very sweet,
but I'm staying with a friend.

717
00:37:05,256 --> 00:37:07,554
Nice to see you again, Spence.

718
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:10,219
Wait wait wait, um...

719
00:37:10,294 --> 00:37:14,230
Would it be totally inappropriate
to invite you to dinner?

720
00:37:14,298 --> 00:37:18,257
I just don't think
I'm ready to see anybody right now.

721
00:37:20,271 --> 00:37:22,296
Thanks for asking.

722
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:24,307
It's nice to be asked.

723
00:37:34,952 --> 00:37:38,285
I just invited her
to stay at my parents' house.

724
00:37:39,824 --> 00:37:43,157
Wow.
What am I doing?

725
00:37:47,164 --> 00:37:48,791
( grunts )

726
00:37:48,866 --> 00:37:50,333
Archibald just called me.

727
00:37:50,401 --> 00:37:52,665
He's screaming
for a foot scrub.

728
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:55,137
- ( siren wails )
- I told him you'd be right up.

729
00:37:57,241 --> 00:37:58,674
( grunts )

730
00:37:58,743 --> 00:38:00,438
And stay away from the wives!

731
00:38:00,511 --> 00:38:03,139
Present, future, uh... past.

732
00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:04,977
Got it, dick hole?

733
00:38:08,486 --> 00:38:10,283
- Come on, Karl.
- Karl: Okay.

734
00:38:10,354 --> 00:38:11,446
- Let's go.
- All right.

735
00:38:11,522 --> 00:38:13,319
So good, they don't know shit
about Cougar Club.

736
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:15,154
- No, but we gotta be careful.
- ( squeals )

737
00:38:15,226 --> 00:38:17,251
Their antennas are up,
all of their antennas are up.

738
00:38:17,328 --> 00:38:19,296
- 'Night, boys.
- Good night, my little carnation.

739
00:38:19,363 --> 00:38:21,263
Oh!
( giggles )

740
00:38:21,332 --> 00:38:23,266
Hogan?

741
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:24,801
Thank you, baby.

742
00:38:24,869 --> 00:38:26,666
Hey.

743
00:38:29,073 --> 00:38:31,541
Is Conrad's wife hot?
I don't remember.

744
00:38:31,609 --> 00:38:34,669
Yeah, but she's like 38.

745
00:38:34,745 --> 00:38:37,441
Oh. Little young for me.
I'll do her anyway,

746
00:38:37,515 --> 00:38:39,949
that way Karl here
can do Archibald's wife,

747
00:38:40,017 --> 00:38:42,008
I'll hit Conrad's,
you can hit Stack's.

748
00:38:42,086 --> 00:38:44,111
- Cool.
- I'm not hitting Stack's wife.

749
00:38:44,188 --> 00:38:46,122
I don't even know what
I'm doing with Stack's wife.

750
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,782
- You can do it.
- ( car honks )

751
00:38:47,858 --> 00:38:49,382
Spence:
Oh shit.

752
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:52,293
( pop music playing )

753
00:38:52,363 --> 00:38:55,526
Hi. Did you lose my number?

754
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:58,591
- No.
- Get in.

755
00:38:59,904 --> 00:39:03,203
There you go.
See you at home.

756
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:06,175
( growls )

757
00:39:08,112 --> 00:39:09,636
- Hi.
- Hi.

758
00:39:09,714 --> 00:39:13,548
- Ah. This is a nice surprise.
- Mm-hmm.

759
00:39:14,585 --> 00:39:17,520
You are the boys,
I'm just a girl

760
00:39:17,588 --> 00:39:20,056
We're not the same,
we're from different worlds

761
00:39:20,491 --> 00:39:23,392
You think you're smart
but you're no fun

762
00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:28,398
How hard is it
to fall in love?

763
00:39:28,466 --> 00:39:30,400
Boys...

764
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:32,868
So, why are you avoiding me?

765
00:39:32,937 --> 00:39:36,873
I'm-- I'm not. I just--
work has been really--

766
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:40,104
If you have something important
to say to me, then just say it.

767
00:39:40,177 --> 00:39:42,372
- ( turns off music )
- Amanda, I don't.

768
00:39:42,446 --> 00:39:46,348
I just-- just wanna go in
and go to sleep.

769
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:48,749
Fine, let's go in
and go to sleep.

770
00:39:48,819 --> 00:39:52,687
Can't sleep with you
at my parents' house.

771
00:39:52,757 --> 00:39:54,691
That's right.

772
00:39:54,759 --> 00:39:57,023
That's why I think
you should move in with me.

773
00:39:57,094 --> 00:39:58,356
Oh, Amanda.

774
00:39:58,429 --> 00:40:01,023
We are ready
for that next step, Spencey--

775
00:40:01,098 --> 00:40:04,261
our first apartment.
And I'm even willing to cover the rent,

776
00:40:04,335 --> 00:40:07,065
because I know you'll be
facing enormous law-school bills

777
00:40:07,138 --> 00:40:10,266
and I know my assistance to you
will be paid back to me tenfold

778
00:40:10,341 --> 00:40:12,809
once you're out of law school
and we're married!

779
00:40:12,877 --> 00:40:13,969
Wow, Amanda--

780
00:40:14,044 --> 00:40:16,444
It'll be like that movie,
"Pay It Forward," with Kevin Spacey.

781
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:19,210
You'll be Helen Hunt,
I'll be Kevin Spacey.

782
00:40:19,283 --> 00:40:21,478
Okay, I didn't see that one.
Amanda, look, I think we--

783
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:24,282
- Spencey, I love you.
- I love you too.

784
00:40:24,355 --> 00:40:25,879
( chuckles )
It's just, I'm not--

785
00:40:25,956 --> 00:40:27,446
Shh shh shh shh.

786
00:40:27,525 --> 00:40:29,550
Just think about it.

787
00:40:29,627 --> 00:40:31,959
It's perfect. Okay?

788
00:40:32,029 --> 00:40:33,428
- Kiss.
- Okay.

789
00:40:33,497 --> 00:40:34,725
Lip gloss, though.

790
00:40:34,799 --> 00:40:36,630
All right.

791
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,668
( gardener whistling
"Battle Hymn of the Republic" )

792
00:40:48,379 --> 00:40:51,212
- ( sighs )
- ( music blaring )

793
00:40:53,484 --> 00:40:57,147
Four-leaf clover. Agh!

794
00:40:58,923 --> 00:41:00,390
Here we go.

795
00:41:01,926 --> 00:41:03,450
You boys sleep tight.

796
00:41:03,527 --> 00:41:05,518
- Thanks, Mom.
- Thanks, Mom.

797
00:41:05,596 --> 00:41:08,588
See, you think Amanda's gonna
do shit like this for you?

798
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:10,293
What are you doing?

799
00:41:10,367 --> 00:41:12,460
What? This is avocado
and banana.

800
00:41:12,536 --> 00:41:14,197
You use this stuff,
you never go bald.

801
00:41:14,271 --> 00:41:15,465
- Really?
- Yup.

802
00:41:15,539 --> 00:41:17,530
- It's tingling.
- Is it supposed to?

803
00:41:17,608 --> 00:41:18,768
I don't know.

804
00:41:18,843 --> 00:41:21,937
So, what's the deal again
with Mrs. Birnbaum?

805
00:41:22,012 --> 00:41:24,537
Okay, now Edith's gonna get a 10% fee

806
00:41:24,615 --> 00:41:27,482
for supplying us
with hundreds of hot cougars.

807
00:41:27,551 --> 00:41:29,610
- Totally worth it.
- All right.

808
00:41:29,687 --> 00:41:31,712
- Wow.
- Did you give her the divorcée files

809
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:33,222
- from the office?
- Yes.

810
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:35,622
And she's totally set up for success.
Now, all we need

811
00:41:35,693 --> 00:41:37,160
is one kick-ass party

812
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:40,061
to get the word-of-mouth
we kind of need to expand here.

813
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:42,621
And I want to go all the way
with this Cougar Club thing.

814
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:46,534
I'm talking lnternet,
magazines, calendars.

815
00:41:46,604 --> 00:41:49,471
I want to go full-on,
nationwide organization.

816
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:51,474
- It's burning! Burning now!
- Man, you should really

817
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:52,839
- just wash that out.
- Yes!

818
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:55,572
- Hoo!
- ( shower running )

819
00:41:55,646 --> 00:41:58,410
So, where should
our first party be?

820
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:01,711
Marshall, I just don't know
how to thank you for this.

821
00:42:01,785 --> 00:42:04,549
Barnaby's in Manhattan Beach
is one of our absolute favorites.

822
00:42:04,622 --> 00:42:05,589
Isn't it, Fred?

823
00:42:05,656 --> 00:42:07,521
Oh no, are you kidding me?
Thank you

824
00:42:07,591 --> 00:42:09,718
for letting me show
my gratitude to you two.

825
00:42:09,793 --> 00:42:11,693
Oh, isn't that sweet, Fred?

826
00:42:11,762 --> 00:42:13,525
- Okay, come on.
- ( stomach growling )

827
00:42:13,597 --> 00:42:15,724
- Hey, what are you guys doing tonight?
- Let's go.

828
00:42:15,799 --> 00:42:17,562
Tonight's gonna be
a big night actually,

829
00:42:17,635 --> 00:42:19,830
- 'cause we have a meeting of all...
- Wow!

830
00:42:19,904 --> 00:42:22,338
- Might have a few people over...
- Oh.

831
00:42:22,406 --> 00:42:24,101
...watch some movies,
play some games.

832
00:42:24,174 --> 00:42:26,574
- Naked Marco Polo.
- That sounds nice.

833
00:42:26,644 --> 00:42:28,407
Well, there are plenty
of sodas in the fridge.

834
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:30,413
- Awesome.
- Have a good time.

835
00:42:30,481 --> 00:42:32,381
Thanks, Mom.

836
00:42:33,417 --> 00:42:35,408
Come on, honey.

837
00:42:35,486 --> 00:42:38,887
Do you have any idea how much
hot cougar ass is gonna be here tonight?

838
00:42:38,956 --> 00:42:41,390
Completely out of control.

839
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:43,926
All three of the bosses' wives
are gonna be represented.

840
00:42:43,994 --> 00:42:46,292
- ( sighs )
- ( car engine turns over )

841
00:42:46,363 --> 00:42:48,058
- Wow.
- Operation Bosses'-wife-Fuck

842
00:42:48,132 --> 00:42:50,396
is definitely a go.

843
00:42:50,467 --> 00:42:52,901
Bye-bye!

844
00:42:54,705 --> 00:42:56,639
- Okay, calm down.
- Yeah, okay.

845
00:42:56,707 --> 00:42:59,437
- Seriously, calm down.
- Man:  Roll, bitches!

846
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:01,102
One two three four

847
00:43:01,178 --> 00:43:03,408
( rock music playing )

848
00:43:06,383 --> 00:43:08,647
Loaded cougar
motherfuckers!

849
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:11,745
Comin' atcha...

850
00:43:20,831 --> 00:43:23,959
Teddy Archibald.

851
00:43:24,034 --> 00:43:26,764
Hey, you look ravishing tonight.

852
00:43:26,837 --> 00:43:28,896
- Doesn't she, guys?
- Well, thank you, Hogan.

853
00:43:28,973 --> 00:43:30,634
Oh, you're so welcome.

854
00:43:30,708 --> 00:43:32,733
Who's your little friend?

855
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:36,371
Teddy Archibald, I'd like you
to meet Karl Dessler.

856
00:43:38,082 --> 00:43:39,913
Hello, Karl.

857
00:43:39,984 --> 00:43:42,179
Hi... ah!

858
00:43:42,252 --> 00:43:44,220
( laughs ) Hey!

859
00:43:46,657 --> 00:43:48,454
I'm not sure she's even a woman.

860
00:43:48,525 --> 00:43:51,255
Uh, I'm not sure he'll even notice.

861
00:43:51,328 --> 00:43:52,625
Mm, you're right.

862
00:43:52,696 --> 00:43:54,425
( woman laughing )

863
00:43:54,498 --> 00:43:56,489
Whoo!

864
00:43:56,567 --> 00:43:59,502
Cindy Conrad is here.

865
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:01,504
Oh.

866
00:44:01,572 --> 00:44:04,166
- I remember now, Trans Am.
- Uh-huh.

867
00:44:04,241 --> 00:44:07,438
Hogan:
Let's go get reacquainted.

868
00:44:07,511 --> 00:44:09,843
Holy shit, she's here. I can't--

869
00:44:09,913 --> 00:44:12,279
Spence, no. Hey, come on.

870
00:44:12,349 --> 00:44:14,749
Don't puss out now.

871
00:44:15,853 --> 00:44:18,879
Oh, Cindy Conrad.

872
00:44:18,956 --> 00:44:20,048
Wow.

873
00:44:20,124 --> 00:44:22,058
- Marshall Hogan.
- Hi.

874
00:44:22,126 --> 00:44:23,718
- It's so good to see you again.
- Yeah.

875
00:44:23,794 --> 00:44:26,422
Wanna fuck?

876
00:44:30,534 --> 00:44:32,058
( gasps )

877
00:44:34,738 --> 00:44:36,535
Okay.

878
00:44:37,941 --> 00:44:39,909
( both giggling )

879
00:44:44,581 --> 00:44:46,776
- Hi, Spence.
- Hi.

880
00:44:50,154 --> 00:44:53,555
Can l, uh, get you a drink or...

881
00:44:53,624 --> 00:44:55,854
anything? Yeah.

882
00:44:55,926 --> 00:44:58,224
Do you mind if l...?

883
00:44:58,295 --> 00:45:00,661
Thanks.

884
00:45:00,731 --> 00:45:02,562
So...

885
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:05,227
how's it going?

886
00:45:05,302 --> 00:45:08,738
Never better. He's dating someone
he thinks he could marry,

887
00:45:08,806 --> 00:45:11,502
so I'm hearing less from him,
which is great.

888
00:45:11,575 --> 00:45:13,509
Can I ask you something?

889
00:45:13,577 --> 00:45:15,568
"Why did I marry him
in the first place?"

890
00:45:15,646 --> 00:45:18,444
No no no, I didn't mean to pry,
it's just that...

891
00:45:18,515 --> 00:45:22,281
you are too beautiful and smart

892
00:45:22,352 --> 00:45:24,912
and nice to be married
to a guy like him.

893
00:45:24,988 --> 00:45:27,718
I won't miss the way
you're looking at me right now.

894
00:45:27,791 --> 00:45:30,589
Everyone looks at me that way,
even when they hear he's my husband.

895
00:45:30,661 --> 00:45:33,596
- I feel bad for you.
- Well don't,

896
00:45:33,664 --> 00:45:35,461
because I kinda hate that.

897
00:45:35,532 --> 00:45:37,932
I'm not a victim. I left.

898
00:45:39,837 --> 00:45:43,864
Look, Cindy dragged me here tonight,

899
00:45:43,941 --> 00:45:45,602
but it's really not my scene.

900
00:45:45,676 --> 00:45:47,871
I'm not into
a meaningless relationship

901
00:45:47,945 --> 00:45:51,346
with some guy who wasn't even
born before disco.

902
00:45:52,382 --> 00:45:54,213
Excuse me.

903
00:45:54,284 --> 00:45:56,184
Wait.

904
00:46:13,137 --> 00:46:15,435
Peek-a-boo.

905
00:46:15,506 --> 00:46:17,906
- Trans...
- Mmm!

906
00:46:17,975 --> 00:46:20,944
...am.
( giggles )

907
00:46:21,011 --> 00:46:22,273
Uh-oh.

908
00:46:22,346 --> 00:46:25,076
- Watcha doin' down there?
- Hide...

909
00:46:25,149 --> 00:46:26,343
and seek.

910
00:46:26,416 --> 00:46:29,112
( sings )
What is she doing?

911
00:46:29,186 --> 00:46:31,677
- She's in there.
- ( both laugh )

912
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:34,855
Uh-oh! Can l...

913
00:46:37,361 --> 00:46:39,261
Ow!

914
00:46:39,329 --> 00:46:41,627
Ah!

915
00:46:43,066 --> 00:46:45,193
( Karl pants, yelps )

916
00:46:45,269 --> 00:46:47,032
Sorry about the bed.

917
00:46:47,104 --> 00:46:50,471
The... king size
is on back order,

918
00:46:50,541 --> 00:46:52,509
so...

919
00:46:52,576 --> 00:46:54,271
Do you and Hogan
share a room?

920
00:46:54,344 --> 00:46:55,936
What?

921
00:46:56,013 --> 00:46:59,278
No. No no no no.

922
00:46:59,349 --> 00:47:00,714
Nope.

923
00:47:01,885 --> 00:47:03,352
- Mm.
- Mm.

924
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:05,513
( Karl moaning )

925
00:47:15,432 --> 00:47:17,900
( Cindy laughing )

926
00:47:17,968 --> 00:47:19,367
Mm-- ow.

927
00:47:19,436 --> 00:47:21,336
How do you feel...

928
00:47:25,742 --> 00:47:27,539
about feet?

929
00:47:36,753 --> 00:47:37,845
Ow.

930
00:47:44,494 --> 00:47:46,655
Mm, oh!

931
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:48,254
Oh, just...

932
00:47:48,332 --> 00:47:51,358
- it's so hard, just need a minute.
- Okay okay.

933
00:47:52,803 --> 00:47:54,771
( Cindy moaning )

934
00:47:57,674 --> 00:48:00,541
( Cindy panting )

935
00:48:03,347 --> 00:48:06,316
Shh shh.

936
00:48:09,653 --> 00:48:11,518
Okay.

937
00:48:11,588 --> 00:48:13,886
- No more "shush."
- I'm ready.

938
00:48:13,957 --> 00:48:17,120
I know,
I can feel it.

939
00:48:17,194 --> 00:48:18,923
- Ooh!
- Mm.

940
00:48:18,996 --> 00:48:21,521
- So young.
- Yeah, so young.

941
00:48:21,598 --> 00:48:22,758
So young.

942
00:48:37,281 --> 00:48:40,580
( Teddy moaning )

943
00:48:40,651 --> 00:48:42,881
Oh yeah!

944
00:48:42,953 --> 00:48:44,318
Take your time!

945
00:48:51,862 --> 00:48:54,660
You know that if you smack my ass,
it doesn't move.

946
00:48:55,699 --> 00:48:57,633
Yeah. Go ahead.

947
00:48:57,701 --> 00:48:59,396
Smack it.

948
00:48:59,469 --> 00:49:01,664
Punch it if you want to.
Go ahead.

949
00:49:01,738 --> 00:49:05,003
Smack it! Smack it!

950
00:49:06,043 --> 00:49:08,273
- Okay?
- Whoo! Ha ha ha!

951
00:49:08,345 --> 00:49:10,540
Wah!

952
00:49:12,983 --> 00:49:14,416
Mommy.

953
00:49:14,484 --> 00:49:18,580
Drop your panties
to the floor

954
00:49:18,655 --> 00:49:21,818
-  Come on... 
- Wanna do it again?

955
00:49:21,892 --> 00:49:23,757
Drop your panties...

956
00:49:23,827 --> 00:49:25,089
Yep.

957
00:49:25,162 --> 00:49:27,960
Drop your panties
to the floor

958
00:49:28,031 --> 00:49:30,659
To the floor,
to the floor

959
00:49:30,734 --> 00:49:32,998
Drop your panties

960
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:36,233
-  Drop your panties... 
- ( horn honks )

961
00:49:42,012 --> 00:49:45,379
Holy shit.

962
00:49:45,449 --> 00:49:47,576
It's my parents.

963
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:52,782
Spencer, you're a 22-year-old man.
You're allowed to have sex.

964
00:49:52,856 --> 00:49:55,324
No no, it's not--
it's not the sex part.

965
00:49:55,392 --> 00:49:57,724
It's the--
the party part.

966
00:50:04,134 --> 00:50:06,125
Holy shit, it's Barry.

967
00:50:06,203 --> 00:50:08,728
- What?
- Barry, my ex-husband.

968
00:50:08,805 --> 00:50:10,136
Your boss!

969
00:50:10,207 --> 00:50:13,040
Fuck! Don't move.

970
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:15,442
Stay here until I get back.

971
00:50:22,486 --> 00:50:24,579
- Nice place.
- Oh, thanks.

972
00:50:25,922 --> 00:50:28,686
Mom and Dad are home,
and they're with Barry Stack.

973
00:50:28,759 --> 00:50:29,748
- Fuck!
- Fuck!

974
00:50:29,826 --> 00:50:32,260
Go outside, make sure everyone stays
out of the fuckin' house.

975
00:50:32,329 --> 00:50:34,524
Yeah. Go go go go.

976
00:50:34,598 --> 00:50:37,897
- Go go go go go go!
- Come on!

977
00:50:37,968 --> 00:50:39,697
( mutters )

978
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:41,704
( woman moaning )

979
00:50:45,409 --> 00:50:48,606
Oh, come on.
Are you kidding me?

980
00:50:48,678 --> 00:50:50,873
Take it outside!

981
00:50:52,082 --> 00:50:54,107
Fred:
Okay, here we... come on.

982
00:50:54,184 --> 00:50:55,515
Here we are.

983
00:50:55,585 --> 00:50:57,849
Mom, Dad!
Mr. Stack!

984
00:50:57,921 --> 00:51:00,082
Wow, what a surprise.
Well, this is great.

985
00:51:00,157 --> 00:51:02,216
Look who we ran into
at Barnaby's, huh?

986
00:51:02,292 --> 00:51:04,692
He was at a wedding reception
in the outside garden.

987
00:51:04,761 --> 00:51:06,524
- Oh, it was stunning.
- Oh, I see, I see.

988
00:51:06,596 --> 00:51:10,555
I thought-- I thought you and Mom
were gonna spend the night, but...?

989
00:51:10,634 --> 00:51:13,467
- Well...
- Oh, your dad had a touch of diarrhea.

990
00:51:13,537 --> 00:51:15,767
So let's--
let's just go sit in the living room.

991
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:18,637
Uh, the living room, Mom,
that's a great idea.

992
00:51:18,708 --> 00:51:22,701
No no, nonsense, nonsense.
The living room's for Yale-bred.

993
00:51:22,779 --> 00:51:24,713
Men talk in the den.

994
00:51:24,781 --> 00:51:27,272
- Hmm?
- Mmm.

995
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:29,716
Ah! Now we're talking, huh?

996
00:51:29,786 --> 00:51:31,083
Oh-- whoa!

997
00:51:31,154 --> 00:51:33,145
Fred:
Watch your step there.

998
00:51:34,958 --> 00:51:36,619
- Mom: Okay now, Fred,
- Yeah?

999
00:51:36,693 --> 00:51:38,786
I'm gonna go get you
your little orange miracle-worker.

1000
00:51:38,862 --> 00:51:40,489
Anybody for coffee
or bundt cake?

1001
00:51:40,564 --> 00:51:42,225
- Fantastic.
- You know what, Mom?

1002
00:51:42,299 --> 00:51:45,427
Why don't you stay here
and I'll go get the coffee...

1003
00:51:45,502 --> 00:51:47,060
Oh honey, no, you sit.

1004
00:51:47,137 --> 00:51:48,900
Honey, Dad and Mr. Stack
are gonna talk

1005
00:51:48,972 --> 00:51:50,667
about your
recommendation letter to Yale.

1006
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:53,072
- You stay.
- It would be inappropriate

1007
00:51:53,143 --> 00:51:56,840
for me to try to influence
Mr. Stack directly.

1008
00:51:56,913 --> 00:51:58,505
Fred:
No no no, sit sit sit.

1009
00:51:58,582 --> 00:51:59,810
Excuse me.

1010
00:52:00,884 --> 00:52:04,012
He's an... impetuous kid,
you know?

1011
00:52:18,568 --> 00:52:21,366
- Mo-- Mom!
- Oh honey! Didn't know you were here.

1012
00:52:21,438 --> 00:52:24,305
Sweetheart, would you look in
the fridge and get that bundt cake?

1013
00:52:24,374 --> 00:52:25,341
Sure, absolutely.

1014
00:52:25,408 --> 00:52:27,774
- Oh, and a can of whipped cream.
- Uh...

1015
00:52:27,844 --> 00:52:30,677
- I don't see it.
- Really, I know I bought some.

1016
00:52:30,747 --> 00:52:32,874
- ( can spraying )
- Oh good, you found it.

1017
00:52:32,949 --> 00:52:34,917
I knew I bought that.

1018
00:52:40,056 --> 00:52:43,219
- ( spraying )
- Honey, is that your tummy?

1019
00:52:43,293 --> 00:52:45,955
Yeah yeah, I think I have a touch
of what Dad has.

1020
00:52:46,029 --> 00:52:48,020
Oh, sweetheart,
is there burning in your anus?

1021
00:52:48,098 --> 00:52:49,565
Yep yep, just a little bit.

1022
00:52:49,633 --> 00:52:51,498
Well, maybe you need
one of Dad's little orange pills.

1023
00:52:51,568 --> 00:52:54,230
Yeah, you know what?
I'm just gonna let it pass.

1024
00:52:54,304 --> 00:52:55,293
- You sure?
- Yes.

1025
00:52:55,372 --> 00:52:57,203
- That's a good idea.
- Well, all right.

1026
00:52:57,274 --> 00:52:58,901
You know where they are.
Come on, sweetheart,

1027
00:52:58,975 --> 00:53:00,966
follow me with that bundt cake.
Let's go.

1028
00:53:01,044 --> 00:53:02,705
Yeah, we don't want
to keep them waiting.

1029
00:53:02,779 --> 00:53:04,303
I know.

1030
00:53:04,381 --> 00:53:06,315
( whispering )
Get the fuck out of here!

1031
00:53:06,383 --> 00:53:08,078
- Gesundheit.
- Thank you.

1032
00:53:08,151 --> 00:53:11,177
( music playing )

1033
00:53:12,322 --> 00:53:14,347
- Here we go.
- Ah, here.

1034
00:53:14,424 --> 00:53:16,153
- ( laughs )
- All right.

1035
00:53:16,226 --> 00:53:18,217
Yeah, beautiful beautiful.

1036
00:53:18,295 --> 00:53:20,263
- ( water splashes outside )
- Oh.

1037
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:24,357
Wow. Hogan's got a hell
of a Marco Polo game going on.

1038
00:53:24,434 --> 00:53:27,232
Marco Polo--
it's still popular, isn't it?

1039
00:53:27,304 --> 00:53:29,329
You sit--
you sit there, honey.

1040
00:53:29,406 --> 00:53:32,204
So Barry was telling me
there that...

1041
00:53:32,275 --> 00:53:35,506
you are quite the ambitious,
hard-working employee.

1042
00:53:35,579 --> 00:53:38,742
And you've got quite
the aptitude for the law.

1043
00:53:38,815 --> 00:53:40,942
- That-- that's great, Spence.
- Yeah.

1044
00:53:41,017 --> 00:53:42,882
- Here you go, Barry.
- Thanks, Mr. Stack.

1045
00:53:42,953 --> 00:53:45,080
- Yeah.
- ( belches )

1046
00:53:45,155 --> 00:53:46,452
- Oh.
- ( stomach growling )

1047
00:53:46,523 --> 00:53:49,856
Oh, that sounds like
it's really deep in your cavity, honey.

1048
00:53:49,926 --> 00:53:52,918
- Just give me the pill, honey.
- Ooh.

1049
00:53:52,996 --> 00:53:55,123
( music playing )

1050
00:54:01,004 --> 00:54:03,973
- ( whispering ) What are you doing?
- I'm in Cougar Club.

1051
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:05,598
Right, and rule number one
of Cougar Club

1052
00:54:05,675 --> 00:54:07,302
is you don't fucking talk
about Cougar Club!

1053
00:54:07,377 --> 00:54:09,106
Now take her back
to your place.

1054
00:54:09,179 --> 00:54:13,411
All the beauty in the world

1055
00:54:13,483 --> 00:54:15,610
All the beauty
in the world...

1056
00:54:28,331 --> 00:54:30,595
- ( all laughing )
- I'm so glad that we...

1057
00:54:30,667 --> 00:54:33,261
- Hi!
- Amanda.

1058
00:54:33,336 --> 00:54:34,997
- Where were you?
- What are you doing here?

1059
00:54:35,071 --> 00:54:36,834
- What?
- We were supposed to go

1060
00:54:36,906 --> 00:54:39,636
on the horseback ride from
Beachwood Canyon to Glendale.

1061
00:54:39,709 --> 00:54:41,142
How could you forget that?

1062
00:54:41,211 --> 00:54:44,305
- It was sunset.
- Oh.

1063
00:54:44,381 --> 00:54:47,509
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I had a meeting here

1064
00:54:47,584 --> 00:54:52,078
with my boss. Mr. Stack,
this is my girlfriend, Amanda.

1065
00:54:52,155 --> 00:54:55,249
Yeah, except you didn't know
I was gonna be here tonight.

1066
00:54:55,325 --> 00:54:57,156
How very nice
to meet you, Amanda.

1067
00:54:57,227 --> 00:54:59,161
I'm Barry Stack.

1068
00:54:59,229 --> 00:55:00,594
Is this true, Spencey?

1069
00:55:00,664 --> 00:55:03,531
It's, um--
what was the question?

1070
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:06,933
Well, obviously you didn't
invite me to your party.

1071
00:55:07,003 --> 00:55:09,267
I mean, apparently I'm just
a little too young.

1072
00:55:09,339 --> 00:55:11,136
All the women
out there are really old.

1073
00:55:11,207 --> 00:55:13,698
Why are you partying
with a bunch of 50-year-olds?

1074
00:55:13,777 --> 00:55:16,177
Are you into old ladies, Spencey?

1075
00:55:16,246 --> 00:55:18,441
What? No.

1076
00:55:18,515 --> 00:55:20,312
I-- I don't know what
she's talking about.

1077
00:55:20,383 --> 00:55:24,149
I-l-l-l-I I don't know-- I don't know
how to thank you enough, Barry,

1078
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:27,678
for this letter of recommendation.
It just means the world to us.

1079
00:55:27,757 --> 00:55:29,520
No thanks necessary, Fred.

1080
00:55:29,592 --> 00:55:31,355
Anyway, after all is said and done,

1081
00:55:31,428 --> 00:55:34,363
I think Spencey's
gonna earn that letter.

1082
00:55:34,431 --> 00:55:37,229
Of course-- of course--
of course he is. Of course, of course.

1083
00:55:45,442 --> 00:55:47,501
Let's go. Let's...

1084
00:55:52,148 --> 00:55:54,139
Oh.

1085
00:55:54,217 --> 00:55:56,208
Good night, Spence.

1086
00:55:56,286 --> 00:55:58,914
- Spence, what's going on?
- It's not--

1087
00:55:58,988 --> 00:56:00,853
Isn't she a little old
for Marco Polo?

1088
00:56:00,924 --> 00:56:02,414
Daniela, wait!

1089
00:56:02,492 --> 00:56:05,256
Spence? Spence!

1090
00:56:07,597 --> 00:56:11,033
I had no idea
he would be here, I swear.

1091
00:56:11,101 --> 00:56:12,398
Don't go.

1092
00:56:12,469 --> 00:56:14,528
Spence, I'm sorry.
You're a really nice guy,

1093
00:56:14,604 --> 00:56:16,538
but I don't want
anything here, okay?

1094
00:56:16,606 --> 00:56:18,938
- Come on, can't we just talk about it?
- Good night, Spence.

1095
00:56:19,008 --> 00:56:20,737
What the--?

1096
00:56:20,810 --> 00:56:23,108
You're not over him yet, are you?

1097
00:56:23,179 --> 00:56:24,373
Spence?

1098
00:56:24,447 --> 00:56:27,280
Are you having
a relationship with this old lady?

1099
00:56:28,818 --> 00:56:32,254
Oh my Go-- you know, I would
expect this from Hogan, okay?

1100
00:56:32,322 --> 00:56:35,018
He's-- he's sick!
But you?

1101
00:56:35,091 --> 00:56:37,924
Amanda, not now, just go home.

1102
00:56:37,994 --> 00:56:40,588
- Daniela, wait!
- ( gasps )

1103
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,831
You're a fucker, Spence!

1104
00:57:06,222 --> 00:57:09,157
Good morning, guys.
Your applicants are here.

1105
00:57:09,225 --> 00:57:11,216
( whispering )
What?

1106
00:57:11,294 --> 00:57:12,761
They're not supposed
to come here.

1107
00:57:12,829 --> 00:57:14,421
Thank you very much,
sweetheart.

1108
00:57:14,497 --> 00:57:16,931
I think we can take it from here.
Gentlemen?

1109
00:57:18,334 --> 00:57:20,734
So, tell us why

1110
00:57:20,804 --> 00:57:23,170
you want to be members
of Cougar Club.

1111
00:57:23,239 --> 00:57:26,072
Well, it's like--
I've been fantasizing

1112
00:57:26,142 --> 00:57:28,667
about my mom's friends
for a long time.

1113
00:57:29,746 --> 00:57:31,737
- So has he.
- Mm-hmm.

1114
00:57:31,815 --> 00:57:33,874
Right. Welcome.

1115
00:57:35,051 --> 00:57:37,611
- Yeah, okay.
- Thanks.

1116
00:57:37,687 --> 00:57:41,088
- Congratulations.
- Why don't you guys read these over?

1117
00:57:41,157 --> 00:57:43,648
A couple times.
Get the hell out of here.

1118
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:55,002
That's 345 and 346.
We've more than tripled our membership.

1119
00:57:55,071 --> 00:57:57,301
It's just like you said.

1120
00:57:57,373 --> 00:57:59,466
- La-la-la!
- You know I don't like that.

1121
00:57:59,542 --> 00:58:01,669
- What?
- This, gross.

1122
00:58:01,744 --> 00:58:05,874
So I look at the question and the answer
just seems to pop into my head.

1123
00:58:05,949 --> 00:58:08,509
And I've been here
so many times before,

1124
00:58:08,585 --> 00:58:11,213
- and I go blank, so--
- Oh! Okay okay.

1125
00:58:11,287 --> 00:58:14,313
( clears throat )
Is it a foot?

1126
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:15,652
Mm-hmm.

1127
00:58:17,594 --> 00:58:19,858
Oh hell no.

1128
00:58:19,929 --> 00:58:22,329
No, try it, it's good.

1129
00:58:22,398 --> 00:58:25,561
Have you tried the toenail?
It's a secret ingredient.

1130
00:58:25,635 --> 00:58:27,500
What the...?
What is this?

1131
00:58:27,570 --> 00:58:29,868
Guys, I passed the bar.

1132
00:58:29,939 --> 00:58:32,373
- No, you didn't!
- I did.

1133
00:58:32,442 --> 00:58:33,807
Way to go, man.

1134
00:58:33,877 --> 00:58:35,310
( grunts )

1135
00:58:35,378 --> 00:58:37,369
I couldn't have done it
without you guys.

1136
00:58:37,447 --> 00:58:39,142
- Oh.
- Cougar Club--

1137
00:58:39,215 --> 00:58:41,513
I swear--
changed my life.

1138
00:58:41,584 --> 00:58:43,677
- That's sweet, man.
- lsn't he sweet?

1139
00:58:43,753 --> 00:58:46,551
- It's true.
- Oh.

1140
00:58:46,623 --> 00:58:48,022
Hey, okay.

1141
00:58:48,091 --> 00:58:49,524
Okay, all right, Karl.

1142
00:58:49,592 --> 00:58:51,150
( laughs )

1143
00:58:51,227 --> 00:58:53,821
Have some celebratory cake.

1144
00:58:53,897 --> 00:58:57,560
Well well well.
Congratulations, butt-licker.

1145
00:58:57,634 --> 00:58:59,158
Thanks, Mr. Archibald.

1146
00:58:59,235 --> 00:59:01,066
( grunts )

1147
00:59:02,772 --> 00:59:05,536
And your wife.
Thank her for me too.

1148
00:59:06,609 --> 00:59:08,577
Stack:
Attention shit turd

1149
00:59:08,645 --> 00:59:10,374
and shit-turd's friend.

1150
00:59:10,446 --> 00:59:13,040
Put down the fucking snacks
and get in here.

1151
00:59:13,116 --> 00:59:17,177
Oh, and a special congratulations
to douche bag.

1152
00:59:17,253 --> 00:59:20,450
I never thought you'd pass.

1153
00:59:24,027 --> 00:59:25,756
He knew my name.

1154
00:59:31,034 --> 00:59:34,128
( door opens, closes )

1155
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:59,121
Assignment time.

1156
00:59:59,195 --> 01:00:01,993
I need you shit turds to go
to L Oberman's house with a camera.

1157
01:00:02,065 --> 01:00:03,760
His address is in the folder.

1158
01:00:03,833 --> 01:00:06,165
I have knowledge
he does hookers by the pool

1159
01:00:06,235 --> 01:00:07,600
on Wednesdays at 3:00.

1160
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:09,900
Take pictures
and bring them back to me.

1161
01:00:09,973 --> 01:00:11,497
Go!

1162
01:00:12,642 --> 01:00:14,166
You are aware, sir--

1163
01:00:14,243 --> 01:00:16,734
Are you speaking to me?

1164
01:00:16,813 --> 01:00:19,611
- It's not what--
- ( speaks gibberish )

1165
01:00:27,757 --> 01:00:29,850
Spence?

1166
01:00:29,926 --> 01:00:32,258
By the way, I was wondering
if you were able

1167
01:00:32,328 --> 01:00:34,694
to finish my letter
of recommendation?

1168
01:00:34,764 --> 01:00:37,631
Not yet, shit turd.

1169
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:40,669
Do you know when you might be
able to finish it? Because I really--

1170
01:00:40,737 --> 01:00:43,035
You'll know when
you're fucking looking at it!

1171
01:00:43,106 --> 01:00:45,438
Okay! Yeah.

1172
01:00:45,508 --> 01:00:47,669
We will know that
when we're looking at it.

1173
01:00:47,744 --> 01:00:49,609
We look forward to that.

1174
01:00:49,679 --> 01:00:51,704
( whispers )
Don't kill the asshole yet.

1175
01:00:51,781 --> 01:00:53,578
( door opens, closes )

1176
01:00:56,853 --> 01:01:00,084
Look what I found
in shit-turd friend's backpack.

1177
01:01:01,424 --> 01:01:03,187
"Cougar Club"?

1178
01:01:03,259 --> 01:01:04,817
Hmm.

1179
01:01:06,429 --> 01:01:09,227
I think our wives
are involved in this.

1180
01:01:09,298 --> 01:01:11,596
( girls hooting, splashing )

1181
01:01:13,569 --> 01:01:15,332
( camera clicking )

1182
01:01:18,908 --> 01:01:22,036
I can't believe she's still in love
with that fucking guy.

1183
01:01:23,279 --> 01:01:25,247
Why won't she call me back?

1184
01:01:25,314 --> 01:01:27,544
Conrad's wife
won't stop calling me.

1185
01:01:27,617 --> 01:01:28,811
It's like, "Dude,

1186
01:01:28,885 --> 01:01:30,750
Ieave me the fuck alone."

1187
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:32,583
( camera clicking )

1188
01:01:34,991 --> 01:01:38,051
Your mind should be dug out
and studied, man.

1189
01:01:38,127 --> 01:01:40,027
Why?

1190
01:01:40,096 --> 01:01:42,223
I know what I like.

1191
01:01:42,298 --> 01:01:45,563
Oh, ladies, I gotta go
pull on my bow.

1192
01:01:47,670 --> 01:01:49,001
Spence:
What is that?

1193
01:01:49,072 --> 01:01:53,839
That, my friend, is a gold lamé
banana hammock.

1194
01:01:53,910 --> 01:01:55,571
No.

1195
01:01:55,645 --> 01:01:58,637
No, that's a bow and arrow.

1196
01:02:03,953 --> 01:02:06,114
Gardener:
Ay, caramba.

1197
01:02:10,159 --> 01:02:11,649
Oh shit.

1198
01:02:15,665 --> 01:02:18,259
- ( boys grunting )
- Who the fuck?

1199
01:02:29,512 --> 01:02:31,343
( groaning )

1200
01:02:36,018 --> 01:02:39,044
Oh, sorry, shit turds.

1201
01:02:39,122 --> 01:02:41,352
I heard you got banged up a little,

1202
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:44,791
but the firm really appreciates
you going that extra mile.

1203
01:02:44,861 --> 01:02:48,456
And hey, I'll write that letter
of recommendation

1204
01:02:48,531 --> 01:02:49,828
real soon.

1205
01:02:53,169 --> 01:02:54,602
- Everyone's paid up.
- Okay.

1206
01:02:54,670 --> 01:02:56,297
- Cool cool cool.
- Thanks for checking, Karl.

1207
01:02:56,372 --> 01:02:57,964
- You all right?
- Yeah. Ahem.

1208
01:03:01,043 --> 01:03:02,635
Hello, Cougar Club.

1209
01:03:02,712 --> 01:03:04,680
( cheering )

1210
01:03:08,084 --> 01:03:11,576
All right, nice to see you guys
showed up here today.

1211
01:03:11,654 --> 01:03:14,646
Let's talk about it.

1212
01:03:14,724 --> 01:03:16,589
How great was pool party?

1213
01:03:16,659 --> 01:03:18,854
( cheering )

1214
01:03:22,698 --> 01:03:25,462
How about Film-Your-Own-
Threesome Thursdays?

1215
01:03:27,737 --> 01:03:30,297
I'm gonna take it down
a notch here

1216
01:03:30,373 --> 01:03:32,534
because some of you are
a little skittish about this one--

1217
01:03:32,608 --> 01:03:34,838
you're regretting it now--
a little something called

1218
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:38,574
"Midnight Graveyard
Cougar Hunt."

1219
01:03:42,785 --> 01:03:44,446
Oh yeah!

1220
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:48,149
All right, all right.
So now, as all of you know,

1221
01:03:48,224 --> 01:03:50,818
September 19th

1222
01:03:50,893 --> 01:03:55,159
is our big Cougar Club extravaganza

1223
01:03:55,231 --> 01:03:57,028
in Beverly Hills.

1224
01:03:57,099 --> 01:04:00,330
That's right.
Okay, guys,

1225
01:04:00,403 --> 01:04:02,530
so it just comes down to this--
simple.

1226
01:04:02,605 --> 01:04:05,699
Don't be pussies,
take care of your cougars,

1227
01:04:05,775 --> 01:04:07,265
'cause they take care of you.

1228
01:04:09,579 --> 01:04:12,514
( all chanting )
Cougar cougar cougar...

1229
01:04:12,582 --> 01:04:15,949
( girl hooting )

1230
01:04:27,163 --> 01:04:28,892
Hello, BMW.

1231
01:04:32,568 --> 01:04:34,934
Nice. A Lexus.

1232
01:04:36,439 --> 01:04:40,273
Ah. Miss Cadillac.
Very nice.

1233
01:04:40,343 --> 01:04:43,403
Ooh. ( growls )
Jaguar.

1234
01:04:43,479 --> 01:04:46,243
- Spence: Oh yeah.
- Hogan: Come over and sort you out.

1235
01:04:46,315 --> 01:04:48,442
( growls )

1236
01:04:50,353 --> 01:04:53,015
Oh shit, it's the Trans Am.
Hide me.

1237
01:04:53,089 --> 01:04:54,886
Hey, Hogan.

1238
01:04:54,957 --> 01:04:58,051
Still ain't moving, baby. Yeow!

1239
01:04:58,127 --> 01:04:59,822
Look at that.

1240
01:05:01,998 --> 01:05:04,523
- Hey.
- You know it, I'll show it.

1241
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:06,067
Whoo!

1242
01:05:07,803 --> 01:05:10,772
- Welcome.
- Guess Daniela didn't come with her.

1243
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:13,934
Okay, Cameron, pay up.

1244
01:05:14,010 --> 01:05:15,944
ATM's inside.
Here you go.

1245
01:05:16,012 --> 01:05:18,572
Tried to run one by Karl?
Not gonna happen, pal.

1246
01:05:18,648 --> 01:05:20,411
He's got eyes like a hawk.

1247
01:05:22,285 --> 01:05:25,413
Look at her.
Here she comes, there she goes.

1248
01:05:25,488 --> 01:05:27,979
( hip-hop music playing )

1249
01:05:38,668 --> 01:05:40,533
Hey!

1250
01:05:52,581 --> 01:05:56,142
Karl. Karl.
Did you-- you swipe this guy in?

1251
01:05:56,218 --> 01:05:57,845
Ooh!

1252
01:05:58,888 --> 01:06:02,016
No, l-- no, I don't know
how he got in here.

1253
01:06:02,091 --> 01:06:03,820
- No.
- Cougar crasher.

1254
01:06:03,893 --> 01:06:06,521
( making lewd noises )

1255
01:06:07,563 --> 01:06:10,123
Well, look at you, baby. Hey.

1256
01:06:10,199 --> 01:06:12,167
Um, can I see
your Cougar card?

1257
01:06:12,234 --> 01:06:13,633
Cougar card?

1258
01:06:14,670 --> 01:06:17,104
I'm gonna have to pull him away
for a sec, will you excuse us?

1259
01:06:17,173 --> 01:06:18,162
Sure.

1260
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:20,674
This is a private party,
and I'm really sorry, members only.

1261
01:06:20,743 --> 01:06:22,677
- You're gonna have to go.
- Come on, man.

1262
01:06:22,745 --> 01:06:27,273
That girl, she wants me.
I can get with her in like five minutes.

1263
01:06:27,350 --> 01:06:30,376
Well, unfortunately,
only members get that chance.

1264
01:06:30,453 --> 01:06:31,613
Members only.

1265
01:06:31,687 --> 01:06:34,019
Well, what do I got to do
to become a member?

1266
01:06:34,090 --> 01:06:37,856
Well, I mean, there's a whole
extensive screening process.

1267
01:06:37,927 --> 01:06:40,623
My partner and l
have to interview you...

1268
01:06:40,696 --> 01:06:42,220
And then if they approve,

1269
01:06:42,298 --> 01:06:46,166
- then you pay a fee of like--
- $3,000 to join,

1270
01:06:46,235 --> 01:06:48,965
and then there is individual fees
for each event.

1271
01:06:49,038 --> 01:06:50,665
Great, I've interviewed.

1272
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:54,005
I just won like, five grad cash
at one of the lndian casinos.

1273
01:06:54,076 --> 01:06:57,512
I'll slide that your way,
and then I'll be a member.

1274
01:06:57,580 --> 01:06:59,878
Okay.

1275
01:06:59,949 --> 01:07:03,043
- $5,000?
- Come here. Come here!

1276
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:05,019
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay.

1277
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:09,046
Let's-- just hold on
just a second, Cindy.

1278
01:07:09,125 --> 01:07:10,490
Hold.

1279
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:13,084
Meet my partner, we'll finish
this transaction, all right?

1280
01:07:13,162 --> 01:07:14,424
- All right.
- Right this way.

1281
01:07:14,497 --> 01:07:16,988
- After you, sir. Please, after you.
- That's fine.

1282
01:07:17,066 --> 01:07:18,556
Attaboy.

1283
01:07:26,275 --> 01:07:29,176
What the hell are you
doing over here, man?

1284
01:07:29,245 --> 01:07:31,543
- I can't fuckin' believe it.
- What?

1285
01:07:31,614 --> 01:07:33,707
Spence:
She's here with him.

1286
01:07:33,783 --> 01:07:36,047
Oh damn.

1287
01:07:36,118 --> 01:07:37,585
I'm so sorry, man.

1288
01:07:37,653 --> 01:07:39,917
Look, just real quick,
I got something I got to ask you.

1289
01:07:39,989 --> 01:07:41,616
- Now?
- Yeah, just two seconds.

1290
01:07:41,690 --> 01:07:45,126
There's this guy here and he's
willing to pay five grand tonight

1291
01:07:45,194 --> 01:07:47,458
to join Cougar Club.
What do you think?

1292
01:07:47,530 --> 01:07:49,862
Spence, what do you think?

1293
01:07:49,932 --> 01:07:51,900
- It's-- it's fine.
- Yeah?

1294
01:07:51,967 --> 01:07:53,400
- Yeah.
- Okay, cool.

1295
01:07:53,469 --> 01:07:55,096
Damn, so sorry.

1296
01:07:55,171 --> 01:07:56,695
- Okay.
- Yes, sir.

1297
01:07:56,772 --> 01:07:58,865
- Now look, my friend is busy here.
- Okay.

1298
01:07:58,941 --> 01:08:00,636
Okay?
But he's gonna give you a shot...

1299
01:08:00,709 --> 01:08:02,074
- Oh.
-...on this, all right?

1300
01:08:02,144 --> 01:08:03,873
- One shot.
- Wow.

1301
01:08:03,946 --> 01:08:07,712
So-- so basically
I give you this...

1302
01:08:07,783 --> 01:08:11,810
5,000 bucks
and I get to go nail that hottie?

1303
01:08:12,988 --> 01:08:15,752
You are a charmer.
Yeah, you get to nail that cougar.

1304
01:08:15,825 --> 01:08:18,123
- Cougar. Eh...
- Cougar.

1305
01:08:18,194 --> 01:08:19,627
Cougar.

1306
01:08:19,695 --> 01:08:20,821
Nice.

1307
01:08:22,231 --> 01:08:24,062
It's there.

1308
01:08:24,133 --> 01:08:26,727
- Welcome to Cougar Club.
- All right.

1309
01:08:26,802 --> 01:08:28,167
Welcome to Cougar Club, man.

1310
01:08:28,237 --> 01:08:29,261
- Ow!
- Hey, what are you--

1311
01:08:29,338 --> 01:08:31,966
- What the hell?
- I'm Detective John Butler.

1312
01:08:32,041 --> 01:08:33,838
You're both under arrest
for pandering.

1313
01:08:33,909 --> 01:08:35,274
- What?
- Beat it, douche bag.

1314
01:08:35,344 --> 01:08:36,834
Oh my... God,
he knew my name!

1315
01:08:36,912 --> 01:08:38,436
Butler: You both have
the right to remain silent.

1316
01:08:38,514 --> 01:08:40,311
- Anything you say...
- Policeman: Turn around.

1317
01:08:40,382 --> 01:08:42,179
...can and will be
used against you.

1318
01:08:42,251 --> 01:08:45,778
- Blah blah blah blah blah...
- No way, not the shit turds.

1319
01:08:45,855 --> 01:08:49,291
Officer, these boys work for me.
Why are they being arrested?

1320
01:08:49,358 --> 01:08:50,757
- Butler: Pandering.
- ( Stack gasps )

1321
01:08:50,826 --> 01:08:53,351
Wow, you think
you know people.

1322
01:08:53,429 --> 01:08:56,125
You hear that, honey?
Pandering!

1323
01:08:56,198 --> 01:09:00,157
Should I put that in your
recommendation letter, Spencey?

1324
01:09:02,338 --> 01:09:04,067
Whoo!

1325
01:09:08,177 --> 01:09:11,169
Here's your car, boys!

1326
01:09:13,249 --> 01:09:15,615
Amanda said
if I kept associating with you,

1327
01:09:15,684 --> 01:09:17,777
it would eventually destroy me,
and she was right.

1328
01:09:17,853 --> 01:09:19,718
Oh, so, this is all my fault?

1329
01:09:19,788 --> 01:09:21,722
I did all this by myself?

1330
01:09:21,790 --> 01:09:23,621
'Cause you were there.
You said, "Fine."

1331
01:09:23,692 --> 01:09:26,286
I wasn't even looking at you
when I said it.

1332
01:09:26,362 --> 01:09:28,694
Obviously, I had
other things on my mind.

1333
01:09:28,764 --> 01:09:31,164
Do you not see how much
I lose in this thing?

1334
01:09:31,233 --> 01:09:33,531
Is that not perfectly clear to you?

1335
01:09:33,602 --> 01:09:37,299
Yale? Totally fucked.
My job? Fucked.

1336
01:09:37,373 --> 01:09:39,307
Oh, what, I didn't lose my job?

1337
01:09:39,375 --> 01:09:40,967
- ( laughs )
- No, I didn't lose my job?

1338
01:09:41,043 --> 01:09:43,170
Don't even pretend
that meant anything to you,

1339
01:09:43,245 --> 01:09:46,009
because you don't have to
care about anything, Hogan.

1340
01:09:46,081 --> 01:09:48,242
You have no responsibilities,
no obligations,

1341
01:09:48,317 --> 01:09:50,547
no one breathing down your
fucking neck every day of your life

1342
01:09:50,619 --> 01:09:52,746
demanding you do something
acceptable so their friends

1343
01:09:52,821 --> 01:09:55,255
won't think badly of them
when they're asked about you.

1344
01:09:55,324 --> 01:09:56,916
You don't even live
in your own house.

1345
01:09:56,992 --> 01:09:58,550
- You know what your problem is?
- What?

1346
01:09:58,627 --> 01:10:00,185
You're a fucking pussy, Spence. Yeah.

1347
01:10:00,262 --> 01:10:03,493
You let people breathe down your neck
and tell you what you should feel

1348
01:10:03,566 --> 01:10:06,865
and what you should be and
what you should do with your life.

1349
01:10:06,936 --> 01:10:09,200
My advice:
Grow up, and be a man.

1350
01:10:09,271 --> 01:10:11,364
All right, you know what?
I'm done.

1351
01:10:14,076 --> 01:10:16,772
Uh, hey...

1352
01:10:16,845 --> 01:10:20,508
You know, I've always,
I've always wondered

1353
01:10:20,583 --> 01:10:23,916
what it would be like to have
my dick in a man.

1354
01:10:23,986 --> 01:10:25,817
( laughs )

1355
01:10:27,523 --> 01:10:30,720
( siren wails )

1356
01:10:46,175 --> 01:10:48,234
I can explain.

1357
01:10:50,613 --> 01:10:52,581
Just get in.

1358
01:11:02,458 --> 01:11:04,551
Come on, let's go.

1359
01:11:04,627 --> 01:11:07,152
You, stay.

1360
01:11:31,587 --> 01:11:34,681
Man on TV:
So goodbye, Susie. Goodbye.

1361
01:11:34,757 --> 01:11:36,452
- Jack.
- Goodbye.

1362
01:11:36,525 --> 01:11:38,652
Jack, please.

1363
01:11:38,727 --> 01:11:41,287
Jack! Don't do this.

1364
01:11:46,869 --> 01:11:49,167
All right, Will,
what do you have for me?

1365
01:11:49,238 --> 01:11:52,696
Will:
Next, State of California versus Holmes

1366
01:11:52,775 --> 01:11:54,868
and Hogan lll.

1367
01:12:08,290 --> 01:12:10,690
Representing ourselves, are we?

1368
01:12:33,282 --> 01:12:34,715
Uh-huh.

1369
01:12:34,783 --> 01:12:36,341
You're late, counsel.

1370
01:12:36,418 --> 01:12:38,010
Yes. Yes, uh...

1371
01:12:38,087 --> 01:12:40,021
How do your clients plead?

1372
01:12:40,089 --> 01:12:42,421
I think I have that.

1373
01:12:42,491 --> 01:12:44,356
Uh, just--

1374
01:12:44,426 --> 01:12:45,688
- Not guilty, dude.
- Not guilty.

1375
01:12:45,761 --> 01:12:47,786
Not guilty, dude.

1376
01:12:48,997 --> 01:12:51,158
Very well.

1377
01:12:51,233 --> 01:12:54,134
Your court date will be set for...

1378
01:12:55,471 --> 01:12:58,201
three weeks from today...

1379
01:12:58,273 --> 01:12:59,672
dude.

1380
01:12:59,742 --> 01:13:01,266
- ( bangs gavel )
- Next.

1381
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:09,545
Hey-- hey, don't worry.

1382
01:13:09,618 --> 01:13:11,245
I've done all the research.

1383
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:15,620
I think I can convince
the judge to drop the charges.

1384
01:13:15,691 --> 01:13:18,182
See?

1385
01:13:18,260 --> 01:13:20,558
Karl, your shoes don't match.

1386
01:13:22,598 --> 01:13:24,395
Oh, fuck!

1387
01:13:24,466 --> 01:13:26,764
I hope the judge didn't notice.

1388
01:13:26,835 --> 01:13:28,769
Oh shit.
I've gotta get back to work.

1389
01:13:28,837 --> 01:13:30,532
Archibald's gonna be on my ass.

1390
01:13:30,606 --> 01:13:33,131
Uh, bye.
I'll see you later, Hogan.

1391
01:13:34,643 --> 01:13:37,544
Ah!
Ha-ha! Hee-hee!

1392
01:13:37,613 --> 01:13:39,706
Think he was
a wise choice for an attorney?

1393
01:13:39,782 --> 01:13:41,750
- He's a free choice.
- Yeah.

1394
01:13:41,817 --> 01:13:43,648
See, it won't close.
That's the problem.

1395
01:13:45,654 --> 01:13:47,918
- So how are you?
- Good.

1396
01:13:47,990 --> 01:13:52,290
Yeah, I'm moving in
with Amanda this weekend.

1397
01:13:52,361 --> 01:13:53,794
- Really?
- Yeah.

1398
01:13:53,862 --> 01:13:56,160
She's been really supportive.

1399
01:13:56,231 --> 01:13:57,698
- Wow.
- Yeah.

1400
01:13:58,734 --> 01:14:02,295
- Is that really what you want?
- I don't know, Hogan.

1401
01:14:02,371 --> 01:14:06,569
I need to go to law school
and get something going with my life.

1402
01:14:06,642 --> 01:14:08,837
- Yeah, well--
- Yeah.

1403
01:14:08,911 --> 01:14:11,038
Bye, Hogan.

1404
01:14:17,586 --> 01:14:19,679
( cheering on TV )

1405
01:14:27,830 --> 01:14:29,127
Hey, Karl.

1406
01:14:29,198 --> 01:14:30,529
Hey.

1407
01:14:38,740 --> 01:14:40,799
Another one of those
in the freezer?

1408
01:14:40,876 --> 01:14:42,810
Yeah, the Salisbury steak,
it's all yours.

1409
01:14:42,878 --> 01:14:45,403
Nice distance.

1410
01:14:55,624 --> 01:14:59,685
So did the three-headed monster give you
any shit about taking a long lunch?

1411
01:14:59,761 --> 01:15:01,353
- ( beeps )
- Karl: No.

1412
01:15:01,430 --> 01:15:03,364
There was other stuff going on.

1413
01:15:06,602 --> 01:15:08,627
What other stuff?

1414
01:15:08,704 --> 01:15:11,036
What, they know--
they know you're a member?

1415
01:15:11,106 --> 01:15:13,040
- No.
- What?

1416
01:15:13,108 --> 01:15:15,702
No way. They know about you
and Archibald's wife?

1417
01:15:15,777 --> 01:15:18,974
No, they know about you
and Conrad's wife.

1418
01:15:19,047 --> 01:15:20,412
- Shut up.
- Yeah.

1419
01:15:22,417 --> 01:15:24,681
Yeah, I heard him say
he's gonna divorce her,

1420
01:15:24,753 --> 01:15:27,347
and then he spent the rest
of the day trying to find out

1421
01:15:27,422 --> 01:15:29,583
if you owned a car.

1422
01:15:29,658 --> 01:15:31,023
And when he found out
you didn't,

1423
01:15:31,093 --> 01:15:33,391
he said it was a good thing,
'cause if you did, he'd find it,

1424
01:15:33,462 --> 01:15:35,555
plant a bomb in it,
and quote,

1425
01:15:35,631 --> 01:15:37,531
"blow you beyond
dental records."

1426
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:39,396
He said that?

1427
01:15:39,468 --> 01:15:41,265
- Uh-huh.
- ( laughs )

1428
01:15:41,336 --> 01:15:43,668
Well, that's a fucking bona fide
terrorist threat,

1429
01:15:43,739 --> 01:15:45,570
punishable by like, 25 years.

1430
01:15:45,641 --> 01:15:47,939
I don't know. I could look it up.
I don't know.

1431
01:15:48,010 --> 01:15:49,841
Think you could get him
to say it again?

1432
01:15:49,912 --> 01:15:51,539
I don't know.

1433
01:15:51,613 --> 01:15:54,707
No, I know you don't know, but if I sent
you in there with a body wire,

1434
01:15:54,783 --> 01:15:57,684
you could provoke him into
repeating it, couldn't you, Karl?

1435
01:15:57,753 --> 01:16:00,244
Oh God. I don't know.
I mean--

1436
01:16:00,322 --> 01:16:02,415
you know what?
Okay, I want to, but l--

1437
01:16:02,491 --> 01:16:04,254
Karl, don't help me, okay?

1438
01:16:04,326 --> 01:16:06,191
Fuck me,
this is about the club.

1439
01:16:06,261 --> 01:16:08,593
Where would you be without the club,
Karl? I'll tell you where you'd be:

1440
01:16:08,664 --> 01:16:10,689
You're be fucking files
Q through R.

1441
01:16:10,766 --> 01:16:12,290
Don't go back there.

1442
01:16:12,367 --> 01:16:14,665
The paper cuts haven't even
healed yet, have they?

1443
01:16:16,305 --> 01:16:18,603
No. Come on.

1444
01:16:18,674 --> 01:16:21,643
From the top rope, baby.
Top ropes.

1445
01:16:21,710 --> 01:16:22,802
Yes!

1446
01:16:22,878 --> 01:16:25,472
- ( knocks on door )
- Stack: Come in!

1447
01:16:32,354 --> 01:16:35,414
Uh, hello, Mr. Stack.

1448
01:16:35,490 --> 01:16:38,721
- Mr. Conrad, Mr. Archibald.
- ( curtain remote beeping )

1449
01:16:38,794 --> 01:16:40,659
What do you want, douche bag?

1450
01:16:40,729 --> 01:16:42,822
May l...

1451
01:16:42,898 --> 01:16:45,628
you know...

1452
01:16:46,702 --> 01:16:49,227
How do you-- how do you do this?
I don't know.

1453
01:16:49,304 --> 01:16:51,329
- Ah-- oh!
- ( door closes )

1454
01:16:51,406 --> 01:16:54,341
All right, there we go.

1455
01:16:54,409 --> 01:16:58,243
Hmm, um...
I just couldn't help but hear

1456
01:16:58,313 --> 01:17:00,781
your conversation yesterday about

1457
01:17:00,849 --> 01:17:03,477
Marshall Hogan and how he,

1458
01:17:03,552 --> 01:17:05,281
you know,
did stuff with your wife.

1459
01:17:05,354 --> 01:17:07,254
What did you say about my wife?
You don't understand!

1460
01:17:07,322 --> 01:17:09,415
- ( squealing )
- Huh? I will rip your dick off

1461
01:17:09,491 --> 01:17:11,959
and shove it up your ass!
You hear me, you scrawny little bastard?

1462
01:17:12,027 --> 01:17:13,289
No, I'm on your side.

1463
01:17:13,362 --> 01:17:16,024
Let's hear what
the butt-licker has to say.

1464
01:17:20,535 --> 01:17:22,025
( feedback )

1465
01:17:22,104 --> 01:17:24,334
- Speak, Karl.
- Okay.

1466
01:17:24,406 --> 01:17:28,035
Well... I saw him this morning.

1467
01:17:28,110 --> 01:17:30,374
So I couldn't help but notice
that he had--

1468
01:17:30,445 --> 01:17:34,211
he was driving
this '91 convertible Camaro

1469
01:17:34,282 --> 01:17:37,774
that was red. And so I said,
you know, "Hey, nice car."

1470
01:17:37,853 --> 01:17:39,514
And he said, you know,
"Hell-- uh, thank you.

1471
01:17:39,588 --> 01:17:41,681
Yeah, it's brand new,
I just got it today."

1472
01:17:41,757 --> 01:17:45,523
So, on impulse,
I then took out my work pen--

1473
01:17:45,594 --> 01:17:47,789
which I brought back--

1474
01:17:47,863 --> 01:17:50,058
and I wrote down
his license plate number

1475
01:17:50,132 --> 01:17:52,657
while he was driving away,
because you said

1476
01:17:52,734 --> 01:17:57,330
that if he owned a car,
you would--

1477
01:17:57,406 --> 01:18:00,034
oh darn, what was it?

1478
01:18:00,108 --> 01:18:02,474
What-- what did you say?
I ca-- I can't remember.

1479
01:18:02,544 --> 01:18:05,672
I said I'd put a bomb in it
and blow him up beyond dental records.

1480
01:18:05,747 --> 01:18:08,181
Get to the fuckin' point, Karl!

1481
01:18:08,250 --> 01:18:11,811
I just thought you should know
that he owns a car now.

1482
01:18:11,887 --> 01:18:14,321
And that...

1483
01:18:14,389 --> 01:18:17,017
this is his...

1484
01:18:17,092 --> 01:18:20,391
Iicense plate number
and current address.

1485
01:18:20,462 --> 01:18:23,056
How nice of you, butt-licker.

1486
01:18:23,131 --> 01:18:25,531
- Way to look out for the team.
- Oh.

1487
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:27,693
Oh, thank you, Mr. Stack.

1488
01:18:31,773 --> 01:18:34,173
- Yes.
- Hey, shit turd?

1489
01:18:34,242 --> 01:18:36,676
Why so forthcoming?

1490
01:18:36,745 --> 01:18:39,543
Uh-oh. Uh, well,

1491
01:18:39,614 --> 01:18:44,278
you know, my mom,
she used to cheat on my father

1492
01:18:44,352 --> 01:18:45,785
- constantly.
- Fucking slut.

1493
01:18:45,854 --> 01:18:48,448
No, she--
okay, all right, yeah.

1494
01:18:48,523 --> 01:18:50,787
She-- and I want, uh...

1495
01:18:50,859 --> 01:18:53,726
I don't want anyone to have to
suffer that kind of indignity,

1496
01:18:53,795 --> 01:18:58,255
be it you, Mr. Stack, or Mr. Conrad,
or for that matter,

1497
01:18:58,333 --> 01:19:00,858
Mr. Archibald.
So... ah!

1498
01:19:00,936 --> 01:19:03,803
Ah! Ow, oh!

1499
01:19:03,872 --> 01:19:05,965
Conrad:
Go fuck yourself, Karl!

1500
01:19:06,041 --> 01:19:07,406
Thank you.

1501
01:19:10,946 --> 01:19:12,914
That's lunch.

1502
01:19:12,981 --> 01:19:14,710
All-you-can-eat sushi,
strip bar.

1503
01:19:14,783 --> 01:19:15,943
In.

1504
01:19:18,687 --> 01:19:20,951
Thanks for letting us
use your car.

1505
01:19:21,022 --> 01:19:25,049
I promise, bomb squad'll reverse
anything before it explodes.

1506
01:19:25,127 --> 01:19:27,061
Oh, that's okay, baby.

1507
01:19:27,129 --> 01:19:29,757
I'm just glad
I could be of some help.

1508
01:19:29,831 --> 01:19:31,628
That's my Gladys.

1509
01:19:31,700 --> 01:19:33,827
It's good to see you.

1510
01:19:33,902 --> 01:19:35,631
You too, Marshall.

1511
01:19:37,839 --> 01:19:40,740
Now, no bombs have
been promised here, okay?

1512
01:19:40,809 --> 01:19:42,470
I just delivered
the information.

1513
01:19:42,544 --> 01:19:45,069
There's no guarantee
they're gonna use it at all.

1514
01:19:45,147 --> 01:19:49,083
I mean, the whole threat
can be a threat, and--

1515
01:19:49,151 --> 01:19:51,779
- holy shit!
- ( tires screech )

1516
01:19:51,853 --> 01:19:53,650
Fuck! They're here.

1517
01:19:53,722 --> 01:19:55,121
They're here. Fuck fuck!

1518
01:19:55,190 --> 01:19:57,784
Look at this, fuck!
Oh my fucking God.

1519
01:19:57,859 --> 01:20:00,453
My God. Oh my...

1520
01:20:00,529 --> 01:20:02,121
Look at that fucking-- look.

1521
01:20:02,197 --> 01:20:04,495
- Holy shit.
- Stack: Go go go.

1522
01:20:04,566 --> 01:20:08,832
Karl:
Oh my God. I am gonna shit my pants.

1523
01:20:08,904 --> 01:20:10,531
Oh!

1524
01:20:10,605 --> 01:20:13,665
No, Lord! They meant it!
They actually meant it!

1525
01:20:13,742 --> 01:20:15,869
( Hogan whispers )
Shh! Of course they meant it.

1526
01:20:15,944 --> 01:20:18,845
You ever see what happens to people
in the divorce who aren't their clients?

1527
01:20:18,914 --> 01:20:21,212
- Now calm your shit down.
- Gladys: There are two of them.

1528
01:20:21,283 --> 01:20:23,877
No no no, I think
that one's a monkey or something.

1529
01:20:23,952 --> 01:20:26,045
You think it's Mr. Stack
and Mr. Conrad?

1530
01:20:26,121 --> 01:20:28,681
- They might have hired people.
- Circus people.

1531
01:20:28,757 --> 01:20:31,055
Yeah.

1532
01:20:33,128 --> 01:20:36,063
Oh, they're highly organized.

1533
01:20:36,131 --> 01:20:38,998
( sirens wailing )

1534
01:20:39,067 --> 01:20:41,160
( guns cocking )

1535
01:20:41,236 --> 01:20:42,863
Freeze, you little freak!

1536
01:20:42,938 --> 01:20:45,236
- ( all sigh )
- They got 'em.

1537
01:20:45,307 --> 01:20:47,707
- You're going down!
- ( laughing )

1538
01:20:47,776 --> 01:20:50,176
I swear to God
I'll blow your brains out!

1539
01:20:50,245 --> 01:20:52,338
( Dolly mumbles )

1540
01:20:52,414 --> 01:20:54,041
Ah!

1541
01:20:54,115 --> 01:20:56,583
Hey, don't move there!

1542
01:20:56,651 --> 01:20:58,710
I had no--
l-- I didn't call them.

1543
01:20:58,787 --> 01:21:01,984
Oh yeah, that's the baby.

1544
01:21:02,057 --> 01:21:04,719
- Don't do it!
- Down down down down down!

1545
01:21:04,793 --> 01:21:06,590
Gun down! Right now!

1546
01:21:14,569 --> 01:21:15,934
- ( tears )
- Shit!

1547
01:21:17,005 --> 01:21:18,563
Mommy.

1548
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:21,700
- Down down down down down!
- Ah!

1549
01:21:23,311 --> 01:21:25,973
Down down down down down!

1550
01:21:34,756 --> 01:21:36,621
Amanda:
Spencey, will you get that?

1551
01:21:36,691 --> 01:21:38,989
I'm on the phone
with the wedding planner.

1552
01:21:40,795 --> 01:21:42,922
Hold on a second, Rita.
Spence?

1553
01:21:42,998 --> 01:21:45,228
I thought he didn't
have our address.

1554
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:46,699
- Please, just--
- I want him gone.

1555
01:21:46,768 --> 01:21:47,894
- Okay.
- I mean it!

1556
01:21:47,969 --> 01:21:50,767
- Okay!
- Sorry. Mom gave me the address.

1557
01:21:50,839 --> 01:21:53,740
I... figured she would.

1558
01:21:53,808 --> 01:21:55,469
Hi.

1559
01:21:55,543 --> 01:21:57,067
Thanks. Oh.

1560
01:22:02,217 --> 01:22:04,981
- Really?
- Yeah.

1561
01:22:05,053 --> 01:22:08,079
She's thrilled.
It's really--

1562
01:22:08,156 --> 01:22:10,090
it's a dream come true.

1563
01:22:10,158 --> 01:22:12,922
- Well, congratulations, Spence.
- Thanks.

1564
01:22:12,994 --> 01:22:15,428
Red roses? No no, nobody said
anything about red roses.

1565
01:22:15,497 --> 01:22:18,295
I want perfect white calla lilies.

1566
01:22:18,366 --> 01:22:20,766
Write it down!

1567
01:22:20,835 --> 01:22:23,429
- And I'm going to law school.
- Really? That's great.

1568
01:22:23,505 --> 01:22:26,065
Yeah, Baker accepted me a while ago,
so I'm gonna go.

1569
01:22:26,141 --> 01:22:27,506
I mean, it's not Yale,

1570
01:22:27,575 --> 01:22:29,440
but hey, my dad understands

1571
01:22:29,511 --> 01:22:31,979
- and Amanda's all for it.
- Yeah.

1572
01:22:32,047 --> 01:22:35,414
Well, I'll get out of you two
lovebirds' hair in just a minute,

1573
01:22:35,483 --> 01:22:37,974
but l-- I just wanted
to see your face

1574
01:22:38,053 --> 01:22:39,884
when I showed you this.

1575
01:22:48,063 --> 01:22:49,826
( whispers )
No way.

1576
01:22:49,898 --> 01:22:51,991
And get--

1577
01:22:52,067 --> 01:22:55,093
get this--
they searched Conrad's desk.

1578
01:22:55,170 --> 01:22:57,365
They found one
of our Cougar Club folders.

1579
01:22:57,439 --> 01:23:00,374
Those bastards knew about
our extravaganza all along.

1580
01:23:00,442 --> 01:23:02,205
The whole thing was a setup.

1581
01:23:02,277 --> 01:23:04,108
Oh my gosh.
What does Karl say?

1582
01:23:04,179 --> 01:23:06,044
Well, in light
of what's happened,

1583
01:23:06,114 --> 01:23:07,979
he's arranged a little meeting
with Judge Emerson

1584
01:23:08,049 --> 01:23:11,075
to review our case.
And he wants to talk with us right now.

1585
01:23:13,788 --> 01:23:16,552
Everything's gonna be fine.

1586
01:23:16,624 --> 01:23:18,888
Hey, I'll call you back.

1587
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:20,860
Hi. Hey.

1588
01:23:20,929 --> 01:23:22,487
- Hey.
- Where the hell are you going?

1589
01:23:22,564 --> 01:23:25,294
I... just gotta go meet my lawyer.

1590
01:23:25,367 --> 01:23:26,391
With him?

1591
01:23:26,468 --> 01:23:28,732
- Well, yeah.
- l...

1592
01:23:30,071 --> 01:23:32,699
Spence, I thought
we talked about this.

1593
01:23:32,774 --> 01:23:35,971
If you want to be married to me,
then no more Hogan--

1594
01:23:36,044 --> 01:23:37,238
permanently!

1595
01:23:37,312 --> 01:23:39,746
( mutters )
Fuck you, bitch.

1596
01:23:39,814 --> 01:23:41,509
( chuckling )

1597
01:23:43,885 --> 01:23:45,819
- Oh.
- ( Amanda chuckles )

1598
01:23:45,887 --> 01:23:48,651
Mwah!

1599
01:23:48,723 --> 01:23:50,418
I'm sorry, Amanda.

1600
01:23:50,492 --> 01:23:53,222
I mean, l-- I never even
asked you to marry me.

1601
01:23:53,294 --> 01:23:55,387
Here.

1602
01:23:57,432 --> 01:23:59,992
Wait.

1603
01:24:00,068 --> 01:24:03,595
But wait, Spence, but--
you complete me!

1604
01:24:03,671 --> 01:24:06,071
- God, I almost did that, didn't l?
- Yeah.

1605
01:24:06,141 --> 01:24:09,372
Shake it off, brother. The bullet
to the forehead's been dodged.

1606
01:24:09,444 --> 01:24:13,244
Spence! Come back! Ahh!

1607
01:24:13,314 --> 01:24:15,839
So what's the deal
with this judge?

1608
01:24:15,917 --> 01:24:19,216
Margaret Emerson.
You saw her at the plea hearing.

1609
01:24:19,287 --> 01:24:22,051
She's a nasty one,
real ball-breaker type.

1610
01:24:22,123 --> 01:24:26,787
But when she heard about
the recent arrest at the law firm,

1611
01:24:26,861 --> 01:24:29,125
the almost-certain setup
at the hotel,

1612
01:24:29,197 --> 01:24:31,097
she seemed intrigued.

1613
01:24:31,166 --> 01:24:32,724
- Oh.
- ( stomach growling )

1614
01:24:32,801 --> 01:24:34,428
Oh shit.

1615
01:24:34,502 --> 01:24:36,732
Excuse me, I've gotta--

1616
01:24:36,805 --> 01:24:39,797
um, you know what?
If she comes in,

1617
01:24:39,874 --> 01:24:43,002
just tell her I'll be right back, okay?

1618
01:24:45,380 --> 01:24:47,280
- ( Karl farting )
- Karl, man.

1619
01:24:47,348 --> 01:24:49,714
That's coming
from your anal cavity.

1620
01:24:49,784 --> 01:24:51,945
Just take an orange pill,
it's in the briefcase.

1621
01:24:52,020 --> 01:24:55,285
No, that's okay.
It's gonna be the last time.

1622
01:25:07,635 --> 01:25:11,469
Spencer Holmes
and Marshall Hogan lll.

1623
01:25:11,539 --> 01:25:13,973
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

1624
01:25:16,010 --> 01:25:17,944
Sit down.

1625
01:25:38,032 --> 01:25:39,966
So...

1626
01:25:40,034 --> 01:25:43,197
I'm supposed to believe
that you two punks

1627
01:25:43,271 --> 01:25:45,000
started a club

1628
01:25:45,073 --> 01:25:49,669
so you could hook up
with old broads like me.

1629
01:25:49,744 --> 01:25:52,338
Well, are there really
any other broads to hook up with?

1630
01:25:52,413 --> 01:25:54,210
( both chuckle )

1631
01:25:54,282 --> 01:25:58,013
Your Honor?
May I call you Margaret?

1632
01:25:58,086 --> 01:26:01,351
Margaret, I'm looking
at you right now

1633
01:26:01,422 --> 01:26:03,515
and all I want to do

1634
01:26:03,591 --> 01:26:06,219
is just jump over this table

1635
01:26:06,294 --> 01:26:09,024
and go to town.
I mean, you are a goddess,

1636
01:26:09,097 --> 01:26:11,156
and I'm sorry if I'm, like,
overstepping the bounds

1637
01:26:11,232 --> 01:26:12,563
of polite society here,

1638
01:26:12,634 --> 01:26:15,660
but I would make love to you
all day and all night,

1639
01:26:15,737 --> 01:26:18,672
until you screamed
with an unbearable ecstasy

1640
01:26:18,740 --> 01:26:20,401
- like you've never felt before.
- And we, we--

1641
01:26:20,475 --> 01:26:22,534
we want to be very clear.
In no way did we ever

1642
01:26:22,610 --> 01:26:25,170
exchange money
for sex in our organization.

1643
01:26:25,246 --> 01:26:28,909
We charged membership fees.
No different than, uh, meetmart.net

1644
01:26:28,983 --> 01:26:31,213
or Christdate.net for that matter.

1645
01:26:31,286 --> 01:26:33,754
It's just that our target
was a little more specific,

1646
01:26:33,821 --> 01:26:35,152
- one could say.
- Margaret,

1647
01:26:35,223 --> 01:26:36,656
I'm gonna venture a guess here.

1648
01:26:36,724 --> 01:26:39,215
If I were to come around this table
and gently caress

1649
01:26:39,294 --> 01:26:42,286
the back of your neck
with my tongue...

1650
01:26:43,631 --> 01:26:46,191
a slight chill would
run down your spine?

1651
01:26:46,267 --> 01:26:48,326
Might.

1652
01:26:48,403 --> 01:26:50,371
Wow. Ma'am,
this is no pimp operation.

1653
01:26:50,438 --> 01:26:52,065
- No ma'am, no ma'am.
- We assure you, it's--

1654
01:26:52,140 --> 01:26:54,836
No ma'am, we're bona fide businessmen
with a goal to expand our website

1655
01:26:54,909 --> 01:26:57,343
which-- yes, we have a website now.

1656
01:26:57,412 --> 01:26:59,243
Eventually we plan
to have a magazine

1657
01:26:59,314 --> 01:27:00,906
and then we'll tour
around the country,

1658
01:27:00,982 --> 01:27:03,280
branching out to all
the major metropolitan areas,

1659
01:27:03,351 --> 01:27:05,444
all so that we can
become acquainted

1660
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:07,215
with women such as yourself.

1661
01:27:07,288 --> 01:27:09,882
So sublime, so lush,

1662
01:27:09,958 --> 01:27:12,392
- seasoned, exquisite.
- Really?

1663
01:27:12,460 --> 01:27:13,620
Yeah.

1664
01:27:13,695 --> 01:27:16,186
What about your partner?
Does he feel the same way?

1665
01:27:16,264 --> 01:27:18,061
This guy?

1666
01:27:18,132 --> 01:27:20,259
This guy. Oh my God.
And then some.

1667
01:27:20,335 --> 01:27:22,860
Yeah. Ha.

1668
01:27:22,937 --> 01:27:25,132
Prove it.

1669
01:27:26,608 --> 01:27:28,735
What-- oh.

1670
01:27:47,061 --> 01:27:49,086
Woman:
 You drink whiskey

1671
01:27:49,163 --> 01:27:52,496
But I drink wine

1672
01:27:54,836 --> 01:27:59,136
You wear the watch,
but I keep the time

1673
01:28:03,411 --> 01:28:06,141
You're so delicious

1674
01:28:06,214 --> 01:28:10,344
But I'm tasty, yeah

1675
01:28:12,186 --> 01:28:15,155
You may be fine

1676
01:28:15,223 --> 01:28:20,126
- ( moaning )
-  But I'm sexy, baby

1677
01:28:20,194 --> 01:28:25,257
You may be fine,
but I'm sexy

1678
01:28:25,333 --> 01:28:29,929
You may be cute, but I'm sexy

1679
01:28:30,004 --> 01:28:33,838
You may be pretty,
but I'm sexy

1680
01:28:33,908 --> 01:28:37,776
But I'm sexy,
but I'm...

1681
01:28:37,845 --> 01:28:42,509
You may be fine,
but I'm sexy

1682
01:28:42,583 --> 01:28:43,675
You may be cute...

1683
01:28:43,751 --> 01:28:45,446
Hogan:
Congratulations, Karl.

1684
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:48,353
A few more cases, you can actually
get a car from the 21st century.

1685
01:28:48,423 --> 01:28:50,323
Yeah!
And a new bike.

1686
01:28:50,391 --> 01:28:51,790
- Stop the car, stop the car.
- What?

1687
01:28:51,859 --> 01:28:53,520
- Why? Why?
- Hmm?

1688
01:28:53,594 --> 01:28:56,927
- Oh.
- Mm-hmm.

1689
01:28:59,067 --> 01:29:01,695
- I'm not gonna waste gas.
- Just give me one second.

1690
01:29:01,769 --> 01:29:03,600
- Karl: Okay.
- Hogan: Let us dream.

1691
01:29:04,639 --> 01:29:06,231
Hey.

1692
01:29:10,278 --> 01:29:12,542
I'm sorry that I haven't
returned your phone calls.

1693
01:29:12,613 --> 01:29:15,173
I-- I've just been swamped

1694
01:29:15,249 --> 01:29:17,376
with getting my real estate license.

1695
01:29:17,452 --> 01:29:20,888
It's great to see you.
I didn't know if I ever would again.

1696
01:29:20,955 --> 01:29:22,752
I'm glad you're okay.

1697
01:29:22,824 --> 01:29:24,758
Yeah yeah.

1698
01:29:24,826 --> 01:29:28,523
We're having a party
Saturday night, if you're interested.

1699
01:29:28,596 --> 01:29:31,793
It's at 8:00. I'd love to see you.

1700
01:29:33,401 --> 01:29:34,868
Yeah.

1701
01:29:34,936 --> 01:29:36,904
Sounds good.

1702
01:29:36,971 --> 01:29:38,563
Good.

1703
01:29:38,639 --> 01:29:40,573
Maybe.

1704
01:29:42,410 --> 01:29:44,139
Okay, bye.

1705
01:29:49,517 --> 01:29:52,384
( woman vocalizing )

1706
01:29:56,190 --> 01:29:57,623
Let's go...

1707
01:29:59,794 --> 01:30:02,388
All:
Whoa!

1708
01:30:02,463 --> 01:30:04,761
Here we go, here we go.

1709
01:30:07,502 --> 01:30:09,436
- Whoa.
- Nice nice.

1710
01:30:09,504 --> 01:30:12,564
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. Ho.

1711
01:30:12,640 --> 01:30:16,076
To Stack, Conrad
and Archibald.

1712
01:30:16,144 --> 01:30:18,544
- ( hoots )
- Cheers!

1713
01:30:18,613 --> 01:30:20,274
Bastards.

1714
01:30:21,315 --> 01:30:23,977
- To Cougar Club!
- Cheers!

1715
01:30:24,051 --> 01:30:25,746
- Oh!
- Whoo!

1716
01:30:25,820 --> 01:30:27,617
- Cougar Club!
- Damn it, Karl.

1717
01:30:29,991 --> 01:30:32,186
I'm feeling it. Mmm!

1718
01:30:35,797 --> 01:30:37,458
Take a look around.

1719
01:30:37,532 --> 01:30:41,298
This is what can happen
when you dare to say yes.

1720
01:30:42,470 --> 01:30:44,495
Couldn't have done it
without you.

1721
01:30:46,541 --> 01:30:49,442
True, man. There's so many
ways to say yes.

1722
01:30:49,510 --> 01:30:52,673
Yeah, uh-huh, yep,

1723
01:30:52,747 --> 01:30:55,011
all right, okay, sure.
