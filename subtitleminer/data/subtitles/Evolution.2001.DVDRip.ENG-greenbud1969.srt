1
00:00:15,099 --> 00:00:17,977
I deliver perfection...
and don't brag about it! :D

2
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:36,991
Despite all the warnings,
she was smoking in bed, fell asleep.

3
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:40,202
Bad move.

4
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:50,629
And the fire begins.

5
00:02:57,928 --> 00:03:01,140
It's showtime.

6
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:07,563
Don't worry, ma'am! I'm here to save you!

7
00:03:10,316 --> 00:03:13,777
Keep those people back!
This is an emergency!

8
00:03:14,028 --> 00:03:17,698
Don't you dare die on me!

9
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:21,660
Breathe, damn it, breathe!

10
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:26,498
She's going to make it!

11
00:03:32,046 --> 00:03:34,673
What the...?

12
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:21,136
Damn!

13
00:04:49,373 --> 00:04:53,210
Though it may be hard to believe
a single biology professor...

14
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:57,756
...making in excess of $17,500 a year
could find time...

15
00:04:58,007 --> 00:05:01,427
...to grade your first biology
research papers, I did.

16
00:05:01,677 --> 00:05:05,306
As you can see,
there was a shocking statistical anomaly:

17
00:05:05,556 --> 00:05:09,143
Pretty much all of you got A's.

18
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:16,358
Congratulate yourselves.
I have a good feeling about this group.

19
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:21,613
And I think the parade of A's
will continue to the end of the semester.

20
00:05:21,864 --> 00:05:23,949
So much for the bell curve.

21
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:26,785
Bell curves suck!

22
00:05:27,036 --> 00:05:28,620
- Mr. Kane?
- Dr. Kane?

23
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:31,957
There seems to be a mistake here.

24
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:35,044
My brother and I each got a C-.

25
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:37,796
C-. Me, too.

26
00:05:38,047 --> 00:05:41,300
Allow me to share something
with the entire class.

27
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:47,306
As I was grading papers, I came across
two gems, both entitled "Cells are Bad".

28
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:52,102
Both with just one paragraph, which
I unfortunately committed to memory.

29
00:05:52,353 --> 00:05:54,146
"Cells are Bad."

30
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:56,148
"My uncle lives in a cell."

31
00:05:56,398 --> 00:06:01,654
"It's 10 by 12 and he has to read
the same boring magazine every day."

32
00:06:01,904 --> 00:06:05,032
"The end."

33
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:09,787
You're talking about our papers,
aren't you, Dr. Kane?

34
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:11,080
Yes, I am.

35
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:14,583
And although my standards
are nowhere near where they used to be...

36
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:20,339
...I couldn't put an A on those beauties.
I hope you understand.

37
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:23,342
- Sure.
- Yeah, okay.

38
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:28,180
Okay, let's get back to work
at the periodic table, which...

39
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:31,976
A meteor? Where?

40
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:38,065
Route 89A. Yeah, I got it.

41
00:06:38,774 --> 00:06:43,821
Rest assured, I will be there. Okay, 'bye.

42
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:50,911
How does it look, Professor?

43
00:06:50,953 --> 00:06:52,871
It's tight.

44
00:06:53,122 --> 00:06:55,541
Really, really tight, Nadine.

45
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:59,712
But not too tight.
You just don't have the points. Sorry.

46
00:06:59,962 --> 00:07:03,048
Don't take it too hard.
Geology's tougher than people think.

47
00:07:03,299 --> 00:07:05,551
Are you sure? Could you check again?

48
00:07:05,801 --> 00:07:10,097
I need this credit
to get into nursing school.

49
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,725
Nursing school?

50
00:07:12,975 --> 00:07:15,102
Wouldn't you prefer a different profession?

51
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:19,481
One where lives
were not dependent on you?

52
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:23,402
Actually, what I want to be
is Miss Arizona.

53
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:27,990
But my pageant consultant says
nursing school will impress the judges.

54
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,159
They'll think I want to help people...

55
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:33,454
Ready for lunch?

56
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:37,291
Or have you already eaten?

57
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:41,086
I'm just concluding
a teacher-student conference with Nadine.

58
00:07:41,337 --> 00:07:47,718
Harry, your dedication to your job
is an inspiration to us all.

59
00:07:47,885 --> 00:07:51,764
Regrettably, I have a prior lunch
engagement with Professor Kane.

60
00:07:52,014 --> 00:07:57,227
We'll discuss your extra credit later.
Cheer up.

61
00:07:57,853 --> 00:08:00,981
Let me grab my stuff.

62
00:08:05,361 --> 00:08:06,779
Where are you taking me?

63
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:10,949
- A meteor hit last night.
- That's what that was.

64
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,453
As Glen Canyon's representative
for the U.S. Geological Survey...

65
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:16,497
...I have to check it out.

66
00:08:16,747 --> 00:08:19,541
I'm taking you in case
I have to do something scientific.

67
00:08:19,792 --> 00:08:20,626
Then we eat.

68
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:23,295
You're with the USGS?

69
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:26,298
I signed up over the Internet.

70
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:31,637
Or were you on a cheerleader site and
accidentally got linked to the USGS site?

71
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:34,306
Something like that.

72
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:35,349
Watch it. Take it easy.

73
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,104
That's my baby. Take it easy.

74
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:42,815
Come on! Be careful!

75
00:08:43,065 --> 00:08:46,151
Who's going to pay for the damage
to my goddamn car?

76
00:08:46,402 --> 00:08:49,405
I told you, we don't do that.
It's "force majeure".

77
00:08:49,655 --> 00:08:55,119
"Force majeure", my ass!
That car's a classic '73 Buick Riv.

78
00:08:55,953 --> 00:08:57,162
Who are you?

79
00:08:57,413 --> 00:09:00,582
Harry Block,
United States Geological Survey.

80
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:04,378
My secretary, Ira Kane.
We're here to investigate the meteor...

81
00:09:04,628 --> 00:09:06,505
...if that is what it is.

82
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:09,508
Of course it is. It almost blew up my car.

83
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:12,511
I'm still fuzzy
on why you were here at night.

84
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:14,346
With Betty Lou here.

85
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:19,518
I was practicing for my fireman's exam,
which started seven minutes ago.

86
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:22,604
So I'd appreciate it if you'd let me go.

87
00:09:22,855 --> 00:09:25,441
So you and the blonde found the meteor?

88
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:29,778
Yeah, I found it.
It bounced my car 200 feet in the air.

89
00:09:30,029 --> 00:09:34,742
- Can I go?
- Bob, get him out of here.

90
00:09:36,869 --> 00:09:39,830
Don't leave town.

91
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:44,126
Well, Sheriff, is this the...

92
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:46,462
...point of penetration?

93
00:09:46,712 --> 00:09:52,092
Yeah. It punched through into a cavern
about 80 feet down.

94
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:56,347
Now that's a hole!

95
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:00,643
Damn it!

96
00:10:00,893 --> 00:10:02,478
Next time, you carry the case.

97
00:10:02,728 --> 00:10:07,274
You're the USGS representative.
That responsibility comes with the badge.

98
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:11,737
Oh, my God. Look at that.

99
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:14,823
I believe we've located the target.

100
00:10:15,074 --> 00:10:16,659
Two big smiles, fellas.

101
00:10:16,909 --> 00:10:18,827
Cheese!

102
00:10:19,078 --> 00:10:22,957
Okay, hold it up now.

103
00:10:23,582 --> 00:10:25,834
- Got it.
- It's really hot.

104
00:10:26,085 --> 00:10:28,545
I'll hold you up.

105
00:10:28,796 --> 00:10:30,589
Show a little more nightstick.

106
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:32,508
Look at these jackasses.

107
00:10:32,758 --> 00:10:36,512
Muscle pose. Give me big smiles!
Looking good.

108
00:10:36,762 --> 00:10:40,516
At ease, gentlemen! The feds are here.

109
00:10:40,766 --> 00:10:42,851
Feds? What feds?

110
00:10:43,102 --> 00:10:44,436
Who let you down here?

111
00:10:44,687 --> 00:10:46,605
Let's not get combative.

112
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:50,859
The USGS and local law enforcement
have a long history of cooperation.

113
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:55,364
We're just here to get
some scientific samples. If that's okay.

114
00:10:55,614 --> 00:11:01,120
Yeah, sure. We got
all the photographic evidence we need.

115
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:05,499
- Carry on.
- Thanks. Keep up the good work.

116
00:11:07,918 --> 00:11:10,754
Wow.

117
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:24,935
It just hit last night
and it has stuff growing on it.

118
00:11:25,644 --> 00:11:26,812
Could be cave moss.

119
00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:29,898
After just a few hours? That's peculiar.

120
00:11:30,149 --> 00:11:34,194
Let's get a sample and get out of here.

121
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:46,040
It's bleeding.

122
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:50,336
It's a rock that bleeds.

123
00:11:50,461 --> 00:11:54,632
Now that's really peculiar.

124
00:11:54,882 --> 00:11:57,843
Let's bag it.

125
00:12:06,477 --> 00:12:10,731
I don't know if this USGS gig
is all it's cracked up to be.

126
00:12:10,981 --> 00:12:15,319
I mean, it pads out my résumé,
but am I growing as a person?

127
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:20,658
Am I growing as a Division 3
women's volleyball coach?

128
00:12:22,493 --> 00:12:24,995
You going to do that spectro-thingy test?

129
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:28,707
Spectrograph.
Yeah, I will do a spectroscopic analysis.

130
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:31,001
Your résumé will shine.

131
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:35,839
I got to get to the game.
Let me know if you find anything.

132
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:44,431
Ira, are you sure you can handle this
by your lonesome?

133
00:12:44,974 --> 00:12:47,726
All right.

134
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:26,265
That's impossible.

135
00:14:04,386 --> 00:14:07,765
Ten base pairs.

136
00:14:10,059 --> 00:14:12,728
That can't be.

137
00:14:15,439 --> 00:14:19,652
Come on, ladies! Look alive up here!

138
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:28,452
Tina! When Lisa goes for the spike,
you have to cover the line!

139
00:14:28,702 --> 00:14:31,830
Lisa! Two hands, okay? Two hands!

140
00:14:32,081 --> 00:14:34,208
God gave you two hands for a reason!

141
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:36,877
Big news. The most amazing thing.

142
00:14:37,127 --> 00:14:39,880
The meteor samples are teeming
with one-celled organisms.

143
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:42,091
Their metabolic rates are off the charts.

144
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:45,803
They're dividing at an incredible rate.
Almost exponential.

145
00:14:46,053 --> 00:14:48,722
Their DNA has ten base pairs.

146
00:14:48,973 --> 00:14:51,183
Ten base pairs. That's good to know.

147
00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:55,229
Harry, the DNA of all earth life
has only four base pairs.

148
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:59,566
Come on, ladies! Look alive!

149
00:14:59,817 --> 00:15:01,568
Harry...

150
00:15:01,819 --> 00:15:05,739
...these are organisms from another world.

151
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:09,201
They're aliens.

152
00:15:11,036 --> 00:15:14,581
Is the Nobel Prize paid in instalments
or a lump sum, like the lottery?

153
00:15:14,832 --> 00:15:17,251
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

154
00:15:17,501 --> 00:15:23,382
I'm not. I'm concerned about
the potential tax consequences.

155
00:15:26,385 --> 00:15:30,764
- Why in here?
- I just want to be cautious.

156
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:35,561
Our discovery.

157
00:15:35,811 --> 00:15:38,856
I'm all tingly.

158
00:15:41,317 --> 00:15:43,986
Wow.

159
00:15:46,155 --> 00:15:51,910
I'm no biologist, but how many cells
do single-celled organisms have?

160
00:15:51,994 --> 00:15:56,415
If we want to be big important scientists,
you have to act the part.

161
00:15:56,665 --> 00:15:59,877
Take a look.

162
00:16:14,141 --> 00:16:18,103
There are multi-cellular organisms in there.

163
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:19,188
I know.

164
00:16:19,438 --> 00:16:21,774
- They weren't there before.
- They snuck in.

165
00:16:22,024 --> 00:16:25,736
No, there was no sneaking in.

166
00:16:25,944 --> 00:16:29,531
It's too amazing.

167
00:16:30,532 --> 00:16:32,451
It's like they're evolving.

168
00:16:32,701 --> 00:16:34,203
They're growing.

169
00:16:34,453 --> 00:16:38,207
Growing into more complex organisms.

170
00:16:38,374 --> 00:16:41,210
It's evolution.

171
00:16:41,377 --> 00:16:44,880
Nobel, here we come.

172
00:16:45,381 --> 00:16:50,386
But it's 200 million years worth
in just a few hours.

173
00:16:51,971 --> 00:16:54,723
That's fast.

174
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:58,435
You have no idea.

175
00:16:58,727 --> 00:17:00,104
Get ready!

176
00:17:00,354 --> 00:17:04,566
On my signal! Go!

177
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:07,695
Recruit, wake up.

178
00:17:07,945 --> 00:17:09,697
Wake up!

179
00:17:09,947 --> 00:17:12,825
Go!

180
00:17:13,075 --> 00:17:17,997
- The hose! This thing here!
- Sorry.

181
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,415
Move it!

182
00:17:19,665 --> 00:17:23,836
Wayne, go! Come on!

183
00:17:29,091 --> 00:17:32,344
These things happen, buddy.

184
00:17:32,594 --> 00:17:34,847
There's another test in six months.

185
00:17:35,097 --> 00:17:38,517
Six months? I can't wait six months!

186
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:41,520
At least you have the pool gig
at the country club.

187
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:44,356
Great. Thanks a lot.

188
00:17:44,606 --> 00:17:47,401
Drive careful.

189
00:17:47,651 --> 00:17:52,031
I got it. I do this.

190
00:17:58,203 --> 00:18:01,915
Looks like we have visitors.

191
00:18:08,297 --> 00:18:13,552
Class, since this is our first field trip,
I want you to obey some simple rules.

192
00:18:13,802 --> 00:18:15,054
Dirt.

193
00:18:15,304 --> 00:18:16,639
Nice footwear.

194
00:18:16,889 --> 00:18:19,350
Perfect for spelunking.
Now don't touch anything.

195
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,186
Don't move anything.
Don't even breathe unless we say.

196
00:18:22,436 --> 00:18:24,229
Wear your protective gloves at all times.

197
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,814
Why do we have to do this?

198
00:18:26,065 --> 00:18:29,735
Field experience.
The meat and potatoes of geology.

199
00:18:29,985 --> 00:18:32,071
- Will this be on the final?
- Yes.

200
00:18:32,321 --> 00:18:34,657
- Officer, nice to see you.
- What's up, Professor?

201
00:18:34,907 --> 00:18:36,408
We came to pick up the rock.

202
00:18:36,659 --> 00:18:39,536
Pick it up? What?

203
00:18:39,787 --> 00:18:43,749
Orders from the USGS.
They want it under controlled conditions.

204
00:18:43,999 --> 00:18:46,085
It's very technical.

205
00:18:46,335 --> 00:18:48,587
Oh, technical stuff. It's technical.

206
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:50,339
Okay. Go right ahead.

207
00:18:50,589 --> 00:18:52,758
- We'll just haul it right out.
- Sure.

208
00:18:53,008 --> 00:18:55,678
Deke and Danny?
Remember what we talked about?

209
00:18:55,928 --> 00:18:59,431
You're in charge of hoisting.
Get the winch to the hole.

210
00:18:59,682 --> 00:19:04,311
Fellas? Stop nodding, and stare at me
for a second, okay?

211
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:06,438
Focus.

212
00:19:06,689 --> 00:19:09,942
- You understand what I want you to do?
- Yeah.

213
00:19:10,192 --> 00:19:12,903
Go do it.

214
00:19:22,037 --> 00:19:26,125
Ira, I'm picking up
a heavy creepy vibe here.

215
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:29,920
Yeah, a lot has changed.

216
00:19:31,422 --> 00:19:37,428
Class, I know these look like mushrooms,
but refrain from eating them.

217
00:19:40,222 --> 00:19:42,224
It smells disgusting.

218
00:19:42,474 --> 00:19:45,811
Nadine, sometimes science stinks.

219
00:19:46,061 --> 00:19:49,523
It's the game we play, baby.

220
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:55,612
Rotten egg smell. Hydrogen sulfide, right?

221
00:19:55,863 --> 00:19:58,991
With ammonia and methane.
It's converting the atmosphere.

222
00:19:59,241 --> 00:20:03,662
Look at all this rudimentary plant life.
It's amazing.

223
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:10,878
Not to get all girly here, but I feel
something wiggling around my toes.

224
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:18,469
The ground does seem to be moving.

225
00:20:28,437 --> 00:20:29,563
Flatworms.

226
00:20:29,813 --> 00:20:31,857
Millions of them!

227
00:20:32,107 --> 00:20:34,568
Yuck!

228
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:40,366
Barely 18 hours
and we already have flatworms.

229
00:20:40,616 --> 00:20:42,117
- Look.
- There they are!

230
00:20:42,368 --> 00:20:45,579
Hi, Dr. Kane!

231
00:20:47,081 --> 00:20:50,793
- I almost went down on that one!
- Awesome.

232
00:20:52,962 --> 00:20:56,215
Come here, little buddy.

233
00:20:58,926 --> 00:21:01,887
I won't hurt you.

234
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:09,478
You didn't hurt it. You killed it.

235
00:21:09,728 --> 00:21:12,106
The oxygen must have killed it.

236
00:21:12,356 --> 00:21:16,151
It must need its own atmosphere to live.

237
00:21:16,318 --> 00:21:21,740
Grab a specimen jar. We'll scoop
some atmosphere in there with them.

238
00:21:22,992 --> 00:21:27,746
It took us two billion years to do
what they did in a couple of days.

239
00:21:27,997 --> 00:21:32,167
Those germs are the embodiment
of the American dream.

240
00:21:32,418 --> 00:21:35,087
I'm sorry to interrupt, Professor Block.

241
00:21:35,337 --> 00:21:38,757
But I was wondering if I'm correct
in assuming that that field trip...

242
00:21:39,008 --> 00:21:41,760
...fulfilled any of my missing
credit assignments?

243
00:21:42,011 --> 00:21:43,762
Nadine, you are a very...

244
00:21:44,013 --> 00:21:48,809
...very smart girl. If you would just focus.

245
00:21:52,438 --> 00:21:56,942
Professor, the little wiggly worm things
are breaking.

246
00:21:57,192 --> 00:22:00,070
Ira, look.

247
00:22:03,365 --> 00:22:05,784
It's not breaking. It's splitting.

248
00:22:06,035 --> 00:22:09,121
It's mitosis. That's how they reproduce.

249
00:22:09,371 --> 00:22:11,123
No sex?

250
00:22:11,373 --> 00:22:13,542
No time for sex.

251
00:22:13,792 --> 00:22:16,128
Bummer.

252
00:22:16,378 --> 00:22:19,298
- They're splitting again.
- Put it away.

253
00:22:19,548 --> 00:22:23,135
We call no one, we tell no one.
This is our secret.

254
00:22:23,385 --> 00:22:26,055
What about the government?
They usually get involved.

255
00:22:26,305 --> 00:22:31,435
- No government. I know those people.
- You do?

256
00:22:31,727 --> 00:22:34,647
This is our discovery.
We must maintain absolute control.

257
00:22:34,897 --> 00:22:40,277
We have to do more research and
check our findings. Document everything.

258
00:22:47,284 --> 00:22:50,162
Wayne?

259
00:22:50,621 --> 00:22:53,374
What's this?

260
00:22:53,624 --> 00:22:57,211
That would be an all-cotton towel, sir.
I believe it's a Fieldcrest.

261
00:22:57,461 --> 00:23:02,257
It's a damp towel.
What is a damp towel doing on my "chaise"?

262
00:23:02,883 --> 00:23:05,928
- Let me take care of this for you.
- You should, as pool manager.

263
00:23:06,178 --> 00:23:11,433
If anyone knows what to do
about the dampness on my chair, it's you.

264
00:23:12,643 --> 00:23:17,564
"You know what to do with the towels
because you're the pool boy."

265
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:25,364
What the hell?

266
00:23:34,832 --> 00:23:38,210
Where did you guys come from?

267
00:23:52,683 --> 00:23:55,978
You're dead now.

268
00:24:22,212 --> 00:24:26,800
When I checked the samples this morning
I found three different subspecies.

269
00:24:27,051 --> 00:24:32,598
They're evolving so quickly God knows
what we'll find when we get back.

270
00:24:37,394 --> 00:24:41,649
- Please tell me there's an air show today.
- Damn.

271
00:24:43,984 --> 00:24:47,112
Shit.

272
00:24:55,621 --> 00:24:56,830
Can I help you?

273
00:24:57,081 --> 00:25:00,000
Harry Block, Ira Kane.
United States Geological Society.

274
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:04,505
We're doing some important research.
This is our site.

275
00:25:04,755 --> 00:25:07,341
Not anymore. You're not on the list.

276
00:25:07,591 --> 00:25:09,593
What? We come here all the time.

277
00:25:09,843 --> 00:25:13,013
Well this is not a nightclub.
Why don't you take it somewhere else.

278
00:25:13,263 --> 00:25:15,724
I know my constitutional rights.
You can't tell...

279
00:25:15,975 --> 00:25:21,522
Harry! Maybe you can call your superior,
we can have a word with him?

280
00:25:23,774 --> 00:25:26,527
I have a Harry Block and an Ira Kane here...

281
00:25:26,777 --> 00:25:29,488
Punk.

282
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:33,033
- Talk nice to the white man.
- I'll whup his ass.

283
00:25:33,284 --> 00:25:35,786
White man doesn't like to be yelled at.

284
00:25:36,036 --> 00:25:37,538
Ira Kane?

285
00:25:37,788 --> 00:25:40,207
The Ira Kane?

286
00:25:40,457 --> 00:25:44,378
I've looked forward to this for a long time.
You bastard!

287
00:25:44,628 --> 00:25:47,214
You're history! You're done!

288
00:25:47,464 --> 00:25:48,799
Get his gun!

289
00:25:49,049 --> 00:25:51,385
Take it easy! Okay, they're going up.

290
00:25:51,635 --> 00:25:55,472
You're responsible for the worst month
of my life!

291
00:25:55,723 --> 00:25:58,058
- What the hell was that about?
- I don't know.

292
00:25:58,309 --> 00:26:02,396
Drive down to the command tent.
They're expecting you.

293
00:26:02,646 --> 00:26:03,814
Go.

294
00:26:04,064 --> 00:26:07,067
That guy had me in diapers
for over a month!

295
00:26:07,318 --> 00:26:10,529
What the hell was that?

296
00:26:38,349 --> 00:26:43,479
- General Woodman's expecting you.
- Russell Woodman?

297
00:26:48,525 --> 00:26:50,194
What an unexpected surprise.

298
00:26:50,444 --> 00:26:53,614
For me, too.
I didn't know we were on a hugging basis.

299
00:26:53,864 --> 00:26:55,991
Same old Ira Kane. And you are?

300
00:26:56,241 --> 00:27:01,872
Harry Block, this is Gen. Russell Woodman,
head of U.S. Army Research.

301
00:27:02,706 --> 00:27:05,125
You two know each other?

302
00:27:05,376 --> 00:27:06,961
Ira used to work for me, right?

303
00:27:07,211 --> 00:27:10,047
I worked with you, actually.

304
00:27:10,297 --> 00:27:12,925
You worked in Army Research
in the Pentagon?

305
00:27:13,175 --> 00:27:15,719
All this time I thought you were just
a schoolteacher.

306
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:19,056
No. How did you find out about this?

307
00:27:19,306 --> 00:27:22,810
You leave the Pentagon,
you don't call, you don't write.

308
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:25,312
We like to keep tabs on our prodigal sons.

309
00:27:25,562 --> 00:27:27,481
You tapped my phone?

310
00:27:27,731 --> 00:27:29,483
No. We're not the KGB.

311
00:27:29,733 --> 00:27:33,612
We've been monitoring your computer.

312
00:27:33,904 --> 00:27:35,906
His computer?

313
00:27:36,156 --> 00:27:39,493
All those girls in the photos are over 18.

314
00:27:39,743 --> 00:27:40,911
Yes, I'm sure.

315
00:27:41,161 --> 00:27:42,663
I should have figured, Russell.

316
00:27:42,913 --> 00:27:46,500
You should've known better than
to keep something this big from us.

317
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:48,085
And the CDC.

318
00:27:48,335 --> 00:27:53,674
Just in time. Ira, this is Allison Reed,
senior researcher in epidemiology at...

319
00:27:53,924 --> 00:27:55,843
...the CDC.

320
00:27:56,093 --> 00:27:57,303
Nice underwear.

321
00:27:57,553 --> 00:27:59,930
A garter belt? At a day function?

322
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,515
I can do it. Thank you.

323
00:28:01,765 --> 00:28:03,684
I'm okay.

324
00:28:03,934 --> 00:28:04,810
Dr. Kane.

325
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:08,522
I'd heard about your recklessness
but you are way out of line on this one.

326
00:28:08,772 --> 00:28:11,942
Didn't you realise how dangerous
the situation could have become?

327
00:28:12,192 --> 00:28:13,360
Nice to meet you, too.

328
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:18,032
No need to play the blame game, Allison.
No harm, no foul.

329
00:28:18,282 --> 00:28:22,286
We're all appreciative about the discovery
made by Dr. Kane and Mr. Black.

330
00:28:22,536 --> 00:28:23,871
Block.

331
00:28:24,121 --> 00:28:25,456
Block. I'm sorry.

332
00:28:25,706 --> 00:28:28,208
The confirmation that life exists
outside this planet...

333
00:28:28,459 --> 00:28:31,003
Would be the greatest
scientific discovery of our time.

334
00:28:31,253 --> 00:28:34,548
- Yes, actually.
- Yes, it would.

335
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:37,718
You have my word you'll be
kept in the loop from this point on.

336
00:28:37,968 --> 00:28:39,303
You son of a bitch.

337
00:28:39,553 --> 00:28:42,056
Kept in the loop? We are the loop.

338
00:28:42,306 --> 00:28:44,558
We won't cut you out
but we need to take control.

339
00:28:44,808 --> 00:28:48,312
We're following protocol, Ira.
You remember protocol, don't you?

340
00:28:48,562 --> 00:28:51,231
I have some protocol right here for you,
come and get it.

341
00:28:51,482 --> 00:28:56,570
Look! The fact is, this research
must continue under government control.

342
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,322
We've already secured the area.

343
00:28:58,572 --> 00:29:02,743
We're constructing an airlock
and a state-of-the-art field research facility.

344
00:29:02,993 --> 00:29:06,080
So there's not a whole lot
for the science department...

345
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:08,916
...of Glen Canyon Community College
to do here.

346
00:29:09,166 --> 00:29:11,502
Did you catch that condescending tone?

347
00:29:11,752 --> 00:29:14,296
We are following well-established
federal guidelines...

348
00:29:14,546 --> 00:29:17,591
Please, don't pull this crap.
We deserve to be here.

349
00:29:17,841 --> 00:29:20,594
You deserve to be here?

350
00:29:20,844 --> 00:29:25,599
You're lucky anybody's ever let you
near a science laboratory again.

351
00:29:25,849 --> 00:29:30,270
You're a disgrace,
and a dangerous one at that.

352
00:29:32,356 --> 00:29:35,442
Lieutenant, show these men out.

353
00:29:35,693 --> 00:29:38,445
This is horseshit.

354
00:29:38,696 --> 00:29:40,781
It's not over.

355
00:29:41,031 --> 00:29:44,118
You're in for a fight, Russell.

356
00:29:44,368 --> 00:29:48,205
Would you stop following me? Thank you.

357
00:29:48,455 --> 00:29:50,958
We won't bend over and take this!

358
00:29:51,208 --> 00:29:53,961
Fruit basket for Russell Woodman!

359
00:29:54,211 --> 00:29:57,631
Happy holidays, General!

360
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:02,845
Cute.

361
00:30:03,345 --> 00:30:07,975
Dr. Kane, are you asking me to bar
the federal government from involvement...

362
00:30:08,225 --> 00:30:10,644
...in a discovery as significant as this one?

363
00:30:10,894 --> 00:30:15,733
No. We're asking you to ensure the local
scientists who made the discovery...

364
00:30:15,983 --> 00:30:17,860
...continue to play a significant role.

365
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:20,112
They've kept us out for almost two weeks.

366
00:30:20,362 --> 00:30:24,074
We put our lives on the line to find
these little guys, Your Majesty.

367
00:30:24,325 --> 00:30:27,328
We just want to be there for them
as they grow up.

368
00:30:27,578 --> 00:30:32,082
We were first team at the meteor site and
all the initial testing was done in our lab.

369
00:30:32,333 --> 00:30:36,795
The facilities at Glen Canyon
Community College are a joke.

370
00:30:37,046 --> 00:30:41,008
They weren't a joke
when I went there, General.

371
00:30:42,509 --> 00:30:46,680
Your Honour, if the court would allow me
to depose Dr. Kane.

372
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:48,307
Depose me?

373
00:30:48,557 --> 00:30:50,851
We think your past
is very relevant, Dr. Kane.

374
00:30:51,101 --> 00:30:56,440
These issues speak directly
to his competence as a scientist.

375
00:30:56,774 --> 00:31:01,570
Dr. Kane, you were a top-level researcher
at USAMRID from '94 to '97...

376
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:02,780
...were you not?

377
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:04,365
That's correct.

378
00:31:04,615 --> 00:31:10,704
You were summarily dismissed
in the summer of 1997. Any idea why?

379
00:31:10,955 --> 00:31:14,375
My services were no longer required?

380
00:31:14,625 --> 00:31:18,629
So your firing had nothing to do
with an experimental anthrax vaccine...

381
00:31:18,879 --> 00:31:25,052
...you developed and administered to
140,000 U.S. Soldiers in May of that year?

382
00:31:25,469 --> 00:31:27,596
I see where you're going with this.

383
00:31:27,846 --> 00:31:32,226
It may have been a factor.
You need to ask the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

384
00:31:32,476 --> 00:31:36,230
I'll do that. For now, can you tell me
what happened...

385
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,565
...to the soldiers who were inoculated?

386
00:31:38,816 --> 00:31:43,737
None of them got anthrax,
if that's what you're asking.

387
00:31:43,988 --> 00:31:45,489
What did they get?

388
00:31:45,739 --> 00:31:48,909
Well, as with any new vaccine...

389
00:31:49,159 --> 00:31:51,662
...there were certain side effects
associated with...

390
00:31:51,912 --> 00:31:53,664
Could you be more specific?

391
00:31:53,914 --> 00:31:58,252
It's very technical.
I'd hate to waste the court's time with it.

392
00:31:58,502 --> 00:32:01,130
Humour me.

393
00:32:01,338 --> 00:32:04,925
Some debilitating stomach cramps.

394
00:32:05,175 --> 00:32:06,927
Severe diarrhoea.

395
00:32:07,177 --> 00:32:09,096
Memory loss.

396
00:32:09,346 --> 00:32:13,767
Yes. Go on. Any more symptoms?

397
00:32:14,351 --> 00:32:18,939
Partial facial paralysis,
temporary blindness, drooling...

398
00:32:19,189 --> 00:32:22,276
...bleeding gums, erectile dysfunction...

399
00:32:22,526 --> 00:32:25,070
...uncontrollable flatulence.

400
00:32:25,321 --> 00:32:27,448
I think that's it.

401
00:32:27,698 --> 00:32:29,450
One more question.

402
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:34,371
Do you remember
what the soldiers called this illness?

403
00:32:39,877 --> 00:32:43,714
They called it the Kane Madness.

404
00:32:47,718 --> 00:32:50,304
Keep your head up.

405
00:32:50,554 --> 00:32:53,223
You know she wants to give you some.

406
00:32:53,474 --> 00:32:55,976
Were you even in that courtroom?

407
00:32:56,226 --> 00:33:01,940
Getting barbecued like babyback ribs?
It's all foreplay.

408
00:33:10,074 --> 00:33:11,241
We've been hit.

409
00:33:11,492 --> 00:33:15,621
Forget the foreplay. We just got screwed.

410
00:33:18,415 --> 00:33:21,335
- Empty.
- This is bad. This is very, very bad.

411
00:33:21,585 --> 00:33:24,588
Damn it!

412
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:30,803
I don't care who they are.
Stealing is stealing!

413
00:33:38,268 --> 00:33:42,064
They took the rock, the samples,
all the little wormy critters.

414
00:33:42,314 --> 00:33:46,443
All the data's gone. The JPEG files,
the DNA sequences. They cleaned us out.

415
00:33:46,694 --> 00:33:49,029
- I'm calling the cops.
- The cops?

416
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:52,324
They are the cops!

417
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:55,286
Then what?

418
00:34:07,798 --> 00:34:09,174
Let me ask you something.

419
00:34:09,425 --> 00:34:12,136
How come you get to be a colonel
and I'm just a private?

420
00:34:12,386 --> 00:34:13,595
I was a colonel.

421
00:34:13,846 --> 00:34:16,432
And you obviously served
your country with distinction.

422
00:34:16,682 --> 00:34:17,933
Consider yourself lucky.

423
00:34:18,183 --> 00:34:21,270
The penalty for impersonating an officer
is five years in prison.

424
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:25,441
Maybe for you, white boy. Me, they hang.

425
00:34:25,691 --> 00:34:28,902
Colonels first.

426
00:34:30,112 --> 00:34:36,118
We been out here for twelve hours.
My toe is starting to hurt.

427
00:34:39,455 --> 00:34:42,458
Stop it.

428
00:34:45,711 --> 00:34:49,923
- Just act like you belong.
- Don't worry, I got this.

429
00:34:50,049 --> 00:34:51,967
- Pick up that butt, soldier.
- Sorry, sir.

430
00:34:52,217 --> 00:34:54,887
- And tuck that shirt in.
- Yes, sir.

431
00:34:55,137 --> 00:34:57,931
Get the door.

432
00:34:59,725 --> 00:35:01,310
Thank you, Private.

433
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:04,813
Don't get used to this.

434
00:35:32,257 --> 00:35:34,969
Look at that.

435
00:35:38,597 --> 00:35:42,059
Enjoy your lunch, gentlemen.

436
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:51,652
Your girlfriend, 11:00.

437
00:35:53,279 --> 00:35:55,531
Darn it.

438
00:35:55,781 --> 00:35:58,033
The woman's a menace.

439
00:35:58,284 --> 00:36:01,203
Testing, one, two.

440
00:36:01,453 --> 00:36:05,040
This is DJ Harry Block here
and I'm an Aquarius.

441
00:36:05,291 --> 00:36:06,959
Stop. I can hear you.

442
00:36:07,209 --> 00:36:12,756
Don't snap at me, unless you want
an angry "Solid Gold" dancer on your hands.

443
00:36:12,965 --> 00:36:15,843
Lieutenant?

444
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:20,848
Who's that?

445
00:36:21,724 --> 00:36:24,852
I don't know.

446
00:36:25,477 --> 00:36:28,314
I don't have anything on my schedule.

447
00:36:28,564 --> 00:36:32,735
Maybe it's the guys from Sector 12
doing a nocturnal specimen run.

448
00:36:32,985 --> 00:36:36,155
You know how those guys are.

449
00:36:41,493 --> 00:36:44,872
This place has changed.

450
00:37:03,724 --> 00:37:05,267
Can you believe this?

451
00:37:05,517 --> 00:37:08,729
Harry, look at that.

452
00:37:22,451 --> 00:37:26,163
Our little babies are growing up.

453
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:36,423
Three weeks,
it's already like a rain forest in here.

454
00:37:37,883 --> 00:37:42,179
Looks like the kitchen
from my first apartment.

455
00:37:48,268 --> 00:37:49,937
Harry...

456
00:37:50,187 --> 00:37:53,357
...check that guy out.

457
00:37:58,737 --> 00:38:01,907
Is it coming or going?

458
00:38:07,413 --> 00:38:09,498
That tree just ate it.

459
00:38:09,748 --> 00:38:14,503
Everything here seems to be food for
something else, so let's stay off the menu.

460
00:38:14,753 --> 00:38:17,798
You got that right.

461
00:38:22,511 --> 00:38:26,056
Come here, look at these little things.

462
00:38:30,811 --> 00:38:32,187
Cool.

463
00:38:32,438 --> 00:38:34,523
Snag one.

464
00:38:34,773 --> 00:38:36,108
Snag one?

465
00:38:36,358 --> 00:38:38,527
Yeah. Snag one and put it in the bucket.

466
00:38:38,777 --> 00:38:41,697
I've seen this movie.
The black dude dies first. You snag it.

467
00:38:41,947 --> 00:38:45,284
Don't be scared.
We came for a specimen, now snag one.

468
00:38:45,534 --> 00:38:49,371
He won't hurt you,
he's turned the other way. He's eating.

469
00:38:49,622 --> 00:38:51,040
Come on.

470
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:53,709
Come on, my little red lobster.

471
00:38:53,959 --> 00:38:59,173
Come on, my sexy little crustacean.

472
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,892
Look at that backside.

473
00:39:10,142 --> 00:39:15,230
Theatre-in-the-round. That's the kind of
trunk space you want in a late model car.

474
00:39:15,481 --> 00:39:17,232
Who does that remind you of?

475
00:39:17,483 --> 00:39:19,568
I have no idea what you're talking about.

476
00:39:19,818 --> 00:39:22,404
She's been throwing it at you enough.

477
00:39:22,655 --> 00:39:24,573
- Dr. Reed?
- Bull's-eye.

478
00:39:24,823 --> 00:39:28,410
Excuse me. Dr. Reed?
Did you authorise a walk-through?

479
00:39:28,661 --> 00:39:30,913
No. Why?

480
00:39:31,163 --> 00:39:34,416
You should probably
take a look at something.

481
00:39:34,667 --> 00:39:37,294
Here.

482
00:39:38,045 --> 00:39:42,091
<i>That's the kind of rump you'd like to roast.
Kind of mother you'd like to butter.</i>

483
00:39:42,341 --> 00:39:45,678
<i>That is a nice image.
And I appreciate your assumption...</i>

484
00:39:45,928 --> 00:39:48,847
<i>... that there is
an actual sexual human being...</i>

485
00:39:49,098 --> 00:39:52,267
<i>... underneath
all Dr. Reed's deep-seated neuroses...</i>

486
00:39:52,518 --> 00:39:54,770
<i>...but I don't think so.
- What?</i>

487
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:58,607
<i>I think she is a humourless ice queen.</i>

488
00:39:58,857 --> 00:40:03,779
<i>That's just a cover, don't you know that?
All she needs is a good humping.</i>

489
00:40:04,029 --> 00:40:08,242
<i>Oh, Ira. Ira!</i>

490
00:40:08,367 --> 00:40:13,664
<i>We have to get a piece of the asteroid.
And cut that out, it disturbs me.</i>

491
00:40:13,914 --> 00:40:15,916
<i>Don't do that behind my back like that.</i>

492
00:40:16,166 --> 00:40:17,793
- I'm not doing it.
- Cut it out.

493
00:40:18,043 --> 00:40:21,005
I'm just walking.

494
00:40:26,343 --> 00:40:28,470
Let's bag that and get the hell out of here.

495
00:40:28,721 --> 00:40:33,726
I'm ready when you are, Colonel.
This disco suit is making me chafe.

496
00:40:35,894 --> 00:40:38,814
Shoo, fly.

497
00:40:39,273 --> 00:40:42,818
Hold it. Right there.

498
00:40:42,901 --> 00:40:45,654
Dr. Reed. Nice to see you again.
We were just leaving.

499
00:40:45,904 --> 00:40:49,700
You realise you're in violation of the
judge's orders. I could have you arrested.

500
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:52,286
Talk about violations. What about our lab?

501
00:40:52,536 --> 00:40:53,829
Anyone have a can of Raid?

502
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:57,499
- What are you talking about?
- You stole our computer files, our samples.

503
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:59,918
- I didn't steal anything.
- Your buddies did.

504
00:41:00,169 --> 00:41:02,004
- They cleaned us out.
- No, we didn't.

505
00:41:02,254 --> 00:41:03,047
Damn right.

506
00:41:03,297 --> 00:41:05,049
You've been trying to grab credit...

507
00:41:05,299 --> 00:41:09,011
...on our discovery from the beginning.
We just want what's rightfully ours.

508
00:41:09,261 --> 00:41:12,431
Credit has nothing to do with it.
I'm concerned with public safety.

509
00:41:12,681 --> 00:41:15,768
- Is any of this true, Flemming?
- Absolutely not.

510
00:41:16,018 --> 00:41:19,396
- Something's in my suit.
- You're not going to believe him!

511
00:41:19,647 --> 00:41:20,939
Something's in my suit.

512
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:24,360
- What?
- There's something in my suit!

513
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:27,029
That's impossible, it's sealed!

514
00:41:27,279 --> 00:41:31,700
The fly! There's a fly in my suit!

515
00:41:31,951 --> 00:41:35,037
Take off your helmet! Turn up the oxygen!

516
00:41:35,287 --> 00:41:38,165
It'll kill it!

517
00:41:39,792 --> 00:41:42,962
Do you see it? Look. Do you see it?

518
00:41:43,212 --> 00:41:44,880
No.

519
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:46,966
- You're all right. Who's the man?
- You are.

520
00:41:47,216 --> 00:41:48,550
- No, you're the man!
- I'm the man.

521
00:41:48,801 --> 00:41:50,886
- You're the man!
- Okay.

522
00:41:51,136 --> 00:41:54,014
Oh, God.

523
00:41:56,976 --> 00:42:00,145
It's in me!

524
00:42:03,482 --> 00:42:06,652
For the love of everything holy,
get this thing out of me!

525
00:42:06,902 --> 00:42:09,405
You'll be okay! Cut him open and get it.

526
00:42:09,655 --> 00:42:12,658
Cut me open?
There goes your Christmas gift, you Judas!

527
00:42:12,908 --> 00:42:14,702
It's moving down his leg!

528
00:42:14,952 --> 00:42:16,912
- What do we do?
- Might have to amputate.

529
00:42:17,162 --> 00:42:19,832
Don't take my leg!
Don't let them take my leg!

530
00:42:20,082 --> 00:42:22,584
Anything else you can do?
He thinks he's an athlete.

531
00:42:22,835 --> 00:42:25,629
Doctor, look.

532
00:42:26,672 --> 00:42:28,340
It's heading for his testicles.

533
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:31,093
Take it! Take the leg!

534
00:42:31,343 --> 00:42:34,221
Wait!

535
00:42:34,346 --> 00:42:35,556
It's going the other way.

536
00:42:35,806 --> 00:42:38,934
Give me some forceps.
I might be able to catch it in his colon.

537
00:42:39,184 --> 00:42:41,937
- How will you go in?
- Rectally.

538
00:42:42,187 --> 00:42:43,397
I'll get the lubricant.

539
00:42:43,647 --> 00:42:46,066
- No time.
- There's always time for lubricant!

540
00:42:46,317 --> 00:42:47,860
Flip him!

541
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:50,279
Okay, here we go.

542
00:42:50,529 --> 00:42:52,531
- You have to try to relax.
- It'll be okay.

543
00:42:52,781 --> 00:42:55,284
I'll shove this gurney up your ass,
see if you relax!

544
00:42:55,534 --> 00:42:56,952
Cheek spreader.

545
00:42:57,202 --> 00:42:59,997
I'm going in.

546
00:43:02,124 --> 00:43:05,044
- Don't clench.
- You're so brave.

547
00:43:05,294 --> 00:43:07,129
- A little more.
- No more!

548
00:43:07,379 --> 00:43:08,797
A little deeper.

549
00:43:09,048 --> 00:43:10,799
No deeper!

550
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:12,468
Squeeze my hand.

551
00:43:12,718 --> 00:43:15,054
- Almost there.
- Open up.

552
00:43:15,304 --> 00:43:17,389
- Breathe.
- I'm breathing.

553
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:21,393
- Almost there.
- You're there!

554
00:43:21,644 --> 00:43:22,645
Got it!

555
00:43:22,895 --> 00:43:26,357
It's over.

556
00:43:27,566 --> 00:43:29,652
It just died.

557
00:43:29,902 --> 00:43:34,281
Don't you ever do that again!

558
00:43:36,408 --> 00:43:39,495
Those forceps were like this.
You took it like a man.

559
00:43:39,745 --> 00:43:43,332
You did great. Can we get you anything?

560
00:43:43,582 --> 00:43:46,502
Ice cream. I'd like an ice cream, please.

561
00:43:46,752 --> 00:43:48,087
What flavour?

562
00:43:48,337 --> 00:43:52,716
It doesn't matter. It's for my ass.

563
00:44:04,436 --> 00:44:05,854
Man!

564
00:44:06,105 --> 00:44:08,524
Now I'm a Hawaiian warrior?

565
00:44:08,774 --> 00:44:13,696
I'm thinking seriously about moving.
Maybe to California. Start over.

566
00:44:13,946 --> 00:44:17,199
Because of the fireman thing?
Big deal. You flunked out.

567
00:44:17,449 --> 00:44:20,035
You know how many times
I've flunked in my life?

568
00:44:20,286 --> 00:44:21,287
A ton.

569
00:44:21,537 --> 00:44:24,373
Pool boy, you watering down the mai tais?

570
00:44:24,623 --> 00:44:29,920
No, sir.
But let me fix you something special.

571
00:44:29,962 --> 00:44:33,716
Because you're nothing
but a big, fat monkey turd.

572
00:44:33,966 --> 00:44:36,677
Excuse me?

573
00:44:36,802 --> 00:44:40,139
Drink's almost ready.

574
00:44:41,307 --> 00:44:45,352
Here you go. That should tide you over.

575
00:44:58,157 --> 00:45:01,577
"Don't forget, folks
That's what you get, folks"

576
00:45:01,827 --> 00:45:06,582
"For makin' whoopee"

577
00:45:16,175 --> 00:45:17,926
Damn it!

578
00:45:18,177 --> 00:45:21,388
That's going to stain.

579
00:45:39,031 --> 00:45:41,116
Barry!

580
00:45:41,367 --> 00:45:44,286
Barry, where are you? I can't see you?

581
00:45:44,536 --> 00:45:46,121
Where are you?

582
00:45:46,372 --> 00:45:50,334
I'm down here, my pet, by the water.

583
00:46:16,402 --> 00:46:21,448
Something just ate Barry Cartwright!

584
00:46:22,908 --> 00:46:26,120
That's too bad.

585
00:46:30,249 --> 00:46:34,086
I don't get it. How does someone
with your background...

586
00:46:34,336 --> 00:46:39,341
...credentials, and talent end up...

587
00:46:39,591 --> 00:46:42,177
...like you?

588
00:46:42,428 --> 00:46:43,345
Thank you.

589
00:46:43,595 --> 00:46:46,890
Your partner could have died.
What were you thinking?

590
00:46:47,141 --> 00:46:48,350
I was desperate.

591
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:51,270
I've been exiled out here in Arizona
for five years...

592
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,272
...watching the world pass me by...

593
00:46:53,522 --> 00:46:59,445
...and this amazing discovery
falls into my lap. It's my ticket out of here.

594
00:47:01,488 --> 00:47:04,908
I don't suppose you would understand that.

595
00:47:05,159 --> 00:47:11,707
No, how could I? I'm just a humourless
ice maiden in need of a good humping.

596
00:47:13,208 --> 00:47:14,627
You heard that?

597
00:47:14,877 --> 00:47:17,254
Loud and clear.

598
00:47:17,504 --> 00:47:20,049
Don't think you know so much about me.

599
00:47:20,299 --> 00:47:22,009
You don't.

600
00:47:22,259 --> 00:47:25,220
I'm sure I don't.

601
00:47:26,847 --> 00:47:30,476
Thank you for not calling the cops.

602
00:47:39,693 --> 00:47:44,073
- Be careful!
- Stop being such a baby.

603
00:47:46,367 --> 00:47:49,745
We've seen that car before.

604
00:47:50,162 --> 00:47:53,707
No more bran for me.

605
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:57,711
Hey, girls.

606
00:48:03,926 --> 00:48:06,136
Cut it out.

607
00:48:06,387 --> 00:48:08,138
It's the meteor guy.

608
00:48:08,389 --> 00:48:10,557
What's in the bag, your blow-up doll?

609
00:48:10,808 --> 00:48:14,645
No. I've got something
you're really going to like.

610
00:48:14,895 --> 00:48:18,607
- What happened to you?
- Shut up.

611
00:48:19,608 --> 00:48:22,361
You guys teach here?

612
00:48:22,611 --> 00:48:25,239
I was thinking about taking some classes...

613
00:48:25,489 --> 00:48:30,786
...but I decided to hit the job market
early and get a jump start on things.

614
00:48:31,745 --> 00:48:33,914
Can we help you?

615
00:48:34,164 --> 00:48:37,293
A guy got killed
at my country club last night.

616
00:48:37,543 --> 00:48:39,837
A real douchebag, but...

617
00:48:40,087 --> 00:48:43,841
...that just doesn't make it right.

618
00:48:43,882 --> 00:48:47,136
It was an animal attack.

619
00:48:50,723 --> 00:48:52,474
Isn't that something?

620
00:48:52,725 --> 00:48:57,229
Happened by the water hazard on the 4th
green. The lady he was banging saw it.

621
00:48:57,479 --> 00:49:01,483
We chased this sucker on the fairway,
then it died in a sand trap.

622
00:49:01,734 --> 00:49:05,237
It just died? How?

623
00:49:05,237 --> 00:49:08,741
Like it was choking to death.

624
00:49:08,741 --> 00:49:11,410
You know? Stopped breathing.

625
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:17,416
It's like nothing I ever saw before.
I thought you guys might want to see it.

626
00:49:30,262 --> 00:49:34,808
Jill, you've got some kind
of infestation here.

627
00:49:35,267 --> 00:49:39,480
You have a serious bug problem.

628
00:49:46,111 --> 00:49:50,824
Jill? There's something in your closet.

629
00:49:53,452 --> 00:49:55,204
Open the door, Grace.

630
00:49:55,454 --> 00:49:58,999
Me? It's your house.

631
00:50:18,477 --> 00:50:21,855
When did you guys get a dog?

632
00:50:23,691 --> 00:50:26,986
We don't have a damn dog.

633
00:50:27,152 --> 00:50:30,906
I don't think that's a dog.
It's like some kind of rodent.

634
00:50:31,156 --> 00:50:34,702
Or a muskrat or a pig.

635
00:50:34,827 --> 00:50:36,495
How did it get in here?

636
00:50:36,745 --> 00:50:39,415
It doesn't look too healthy, does it?

637
00:50:39,665 --> 00:50:42,084
Well, it's frightened.

638
00:50:42,334 --> 00:50:47,256
He can barely breathe, he's so scared.

639
00:50:47,506 --> 00:50:50,592
Come on, cutie pie.

640
00:50:50,843 --> 00:50:52,428
Don't be afraid.

641
00:50:52,678 --> 00:50:56,807
Come on. That's a good boy...

642
00:51:05,024 --> 00:51:07,651
911?

643
00:51:22,374 --> 00:51:25,836
What the hell is that thing?

644
00:51:31,508 --> 00:51:34,094
Thanks.

645
00:51:34,345 --> 00:51:36,930
Pick me up in an hour. No, two.

646
00:51:37,181 --> 00:51:41,560
Well, an hour and a half would be good.

647
00:51:54,198 --> 00:51:58,243
Hi. Do you have any messages for me?

648
00:52:00,496 --> 00:52:03,624
Two single beds, please. We're fighting.

649
00:52:03,874 --> 00:52:08,128
Come on. I'm tired. I've had two hours
of sleep. I need a shower.

650
00:52:08,379 --> 00:52:10,047
They're spreading.

651
00:52:10,297 --> 00:52:14,969
You mean the golf course? Woodman sent
a team out there two hours ago.

652
00:52:15,219 --> 00:52:19,306
Too bad you missed the 5-foot
amphibian that's lying dead in my lab.

653
00:52:19,556 --> 00:52:22,059
They're adapting.
We have got to shut it down.

654
00:52:22,309 --> 00:52:25,980
You're overreacting. We can handle this.

655
00:52:26,230 --> 00:52:28,816
I used to be arrogant like you.

656
00:52:29,066 --> 00:52:31,485
We're both aware of what that led to.

657
00:52:31,735 --> 00:52:35,114
Take me seriously, Allison.

658
00:52:35,406 --> 00:52:37,992
I do take you seriously.

659
00:52:38,242 --> 00:52:41,996
Then talk to Woodman,
because he won't listen to me.

660
00:52:42,246 --> 00:52:46,625
We have to kill these things
while we still can.

661
00:52:47,584 --> 00:52:51,005
All right. I'll talk to him,
but I can't promise anything.

662
00:52:51,255 --> 00:52:53,340
Thank you.

663
00:52:53,590 --> 00:52:57,469
Just one more thing.

664
00:52:57,761 --> 00:53:01,724
Could you ever be attracted to me?

665
00:53:02,266 --> 00:53:06,312
- 'Bye, Ira.
- Just food for thought.

666
00:53:12,109 --> 00:53:15,321
She's mine.

667
00:53:17,489 --> 00:53:20,034
I've been an adjunct professor
for almost four years.

668
00:53:20,284 --> 00:53:26,206
I'm hoping this whole alien brouhaha will
net me an honorary doctorate somewhere.

669
00:53:26,457 --> 00:53:28,876
You going to finish that bacon?

670
00:53:29,126 --> 00:53:32,546
Yeah, I am. I ordered it, didn't I?

671
00:53:32,796 --> 00:53:38,010
So, about the coaching. Girls volleyball?

672
00:53:38,135 --> 00:53:40,220
Do you ever get to see them take showers?

673
00:53:40,471 --> 00:53:44,892
Yeah, all the time.
Sometimes I shower with them.

674
00:53:45,142 --> 00:53:47,227
You're kidding, right?

675
00:53:47,478 --> 00:53:49,897
- So?
- She's going to talk to Woodman.

676
00:53:50,147 --> 00:53:52,232
Thank goodness.

677
00:53:52,483 --> 00:53:55,277
I'm okay.

678
00:53:55,486 --> 00:53:57,571
So, level with me, fellows.

679
00:53:57,821 --> 00:54:00,574
Is there some sort of alien...

680
00:54:00,824 --> 00:54:03,827
...attack happening here?

681
00:54:04,078 --> 00:54:06,872
We don't know.

682
00:54:09,583 --> 00:54:12,211
Could I borrow your cream?

683
00:54:12,336 --> 00:54:13,587
Hi, Denise.

684
00:54:13,837 --> 00:54:17,675
Hello, Ira. Still setting the world on fire?

685
00:54:17,925 --> 00:54:20,511
That's Ira's ex over there
sitting with the cop.

686
00:54:20,761 --> 00:54:24,765
Why the police escort?
You're not under arrest, are you?

687
00:54:25,015 --> 00:54:28,268
Funny. This is Sam.
He's about to make detective.

688
00:54:28,519 --> 00:54:33,190
I know Sam. Maybe you can look into
what happened to my missing shirts.

689
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:36,193
Did I tell you? She left
with two or three of my shirts.

690
00:54:36,443 --> 00:54:38,279
See what I mean?

691
00:54:38,529 --> 00:54:43,242
I'm not up on the law,
but is it against the law to...

692
00:54:43,492 --> 00:54:45,869
...walk out of someone's house
with what they own?

693
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:48,789
You want your shirt? Seriously, take it.

694
00:54:49,039 --> 00:54:52,293
You must be cold, right? Is that it?

695
00:54:52,543 --> 00:54:54,962
Why should I wear a shirt that's yours?

696
00:54:55,212 --> 00:54:56,213
Calm down.

697
00:54:56,463 --> 00:54:59,633
It's amazing how many women
just open their shirt to him.

698
00:54:59,883 --> 00:55:03,304
He'll let you borrow the shirt
for just today. Right, Professor?

699
00:55:03,554 --> 00:55:07,975
<i>10-99, we have a code 12-72
over in Valley Vista...</i>

700
00:55:08,225 --> 00:55:10,477
12-72? That's an animal attack.

701
00:55:10,728 --> 00:55:12,313
10-99 responding.

702
00:55:12,563 --> 00:55:14,481
- Got to go, babe.
- Now?

703
00:55:14,732 --> 00:55:17,610
They're calling.

704
00:55:18,902 --> 00:55:20,321
Be careful out there.

705
00:55:20,571 --> 00:55:24,033
You'll take care of the check, right?

706
00:55:31,749 --> 00:55:35,461
I want those shirts back, Denise.

707
00:55:35,753 --> 00:55:41,675
You have to admit, this animal attack
has kind of an ominous feel, doesn't it?

708
00:55:41,925 --> 00:55:44,011
- Check it out?
- Check it out.

709
00:55:44,261 --> 00:55:47,139
All right!

710
00:55:58,943 --> 00:56:04,365
Looks like we're under the microscope,
so let's be subtle. No cowboy stuff, okay?

711
00:56:04,615 --> 00:56:06,367
- No problem.
- Professionals.

712
00:56:06,617 --> 00:56:08,619
Officer Johnson.

713
00:56:08,869 --> 00:56:10,496
What are you doing here?

714
00:56:10,746 --> 00:56:12,122
We heard about the attack.

715
00:56:12,373 --> 00:56:16,710
Part of our job
is to ascertain if there's any health risk.

716
00:56:16,961 --> 00:56:19,755
No. Not this time. Forget about it.

717
00:56:20,005 --> 00:56:22,883
- You didn't touch it, right?
- That would be a serious no-no.

718
00:56:23,133 --> 00:56:26,637
- You did? He touched it.
- He shouldn't have touched it.

719
00:56:26,887 --> 00:56:28,555
- What do we do?
- I don't know.

720
00:56:28,806 --> 00:56:31,725
Okay. Why don't you come in
and take a look?

721
00:56:31,976 --> 00:56:33,894
I'll be checking things out...

722
00:56:34,144 --> 00:56:38,023
...around here in this vicinity.

723
00:56:44,488 --> 00:56:46,573
This dog is all ass.

724
00:56:46,824 --> 00:56:51,203
Jeez. Ira, look at this, man.

725
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:55,582
He would have come from in here, right?

726
00:56:55,833 --> 00:57:00,212
It's just used for storage
and access under the house.

727
00:57:04,675 --> 00:57:08,887
Looks like he crawled through the dirt.

728
00:57:10,514 --> 00:57:11,932
Hey, guys.

729
00:57:12,182 --> 00:57:13,767
I was conducting...

730
00:57:14,018 --> 00:57:19,106
...a parameter check,
and there's something you better see.

731
00:57:19,356 --> 00:57:21,191
You liked that thing,
you're going to love this.

732
00:57:21,442 --> 00:57:23,444
What is it?

733
00:57:23,694 --> 00:57:26,739
What is it?

734
00:57:34,371 --> 00:57:36,790
Great googa-mooga!

735
00:57:37,041 --> 00:57:40,085
What did I tell you?

736
00:57:41,045 --> 00:57:43,797
They're crawling out.

737
00:57:44,048 --> 00:57:47,801
They're trying to breathe
in our atmosphere.

738
00:57:48,052 --> 00:57:52,431
Fortunately, they haven't been able
to adapt yet.

739
00:57:56,060 --> 00:58:00,439
- I think I know how these things got here.
- How?

740
00:58:01,065 --> 00:58:05,653
This entire area is just a honeycomb
of caves and old mine shafts.

741
00:58:05,903 --> 00:58:09,990
I believe the Moenave cave system
starts a few miles away...

742
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:13,702
...west of the golf course.
It runs into the foothills, continues to...

743
00:58:13,953 --> 00:58:18,332
...the Kaibab Plateau
and goes right into Lake Powell.

744
00:58:19,083 --> 00:58:21,835
Our cave...

745
00:58:22,086 --> 00:58:27,466
...is smack dab in the middle
of the system. It's all connected.

746
00:58:28,384 --> 00:58:30,844
- Could you repeat that?
- I'm impressed.

747
00:58:31,095 --> 00:58:36,600
Beneath this calm, sexy exterior
beats the heart of a true scientist.

748
00:58:36,850 --> 00:58:39,895
That one's moving.

749
00:58:44,066 --> 00:58:47,152
What the hell is it doing?

750
00:58:49,530 --> 00:58:53,117
I think it's trying to breathe.

751
00:59:01,625 --> 00:59:05,170
That's like a big loogie!

752
00:59:20,644 --> 00:59:24,356
"Mazel tov." It's a boy.

753
00:59:26,483 --> 00:59:29,612
It's oxygen tolerant.

754
00:59:36,785 --> 00:59:38,746
It's flying away. Is that a bad thing?

755
00:59:38,996 --> 00:59:42,458
Only if you're a human being.

756
00:59:43,792 --> 00:59:45,419
You know how I hate shopping.

757
00:59:45,669 --> 00:59:51,383
- You need something for Thanksgiving.
- I have enough clothes.

758
00:59:53,010 --> 00:59:57,222
I think that colour is great on you.

759
01:00:29,755 --> 01:00:33,050
I think this may be the place.

760
01:00:40,474 --> 01:00:42,393
Ever used one of these before?

761
01:00:42,643 --> 01:00:44,895
Just 'cause I'm a teacher
don't make me a pussy.

762
01:00:45,145 --> 01:00:51,402
Ladies, there's a flying extraterrestrial
in the store. Can we focus?

763
01:00:58,742 --> 01:01:02,454
I'm in here. Just a minute.

764
01:01:03,747 --> 01:01:07,001
Just a second, please!

765
01:01:07,251 --> 01:01:12,131
I said, just a second, bitch.

766
01:01:13,716 --> 01:01:17,970
How would you like me
to scratch out your eyes?

767
01:01:45,456 --> 01:01:50,002
Here, birdy-birdy-birdy-birdy-birdy!

768
01:02:00,638 --> 01:02:05,476
If I was a giant, nasty alien bird
in a department store, where would I be?

769
01:02:05,726 --> 01:02:08,354
- Lingerie.
- Not you, the bird.

770
01:02:08,604 --> 01:02:11,357
Lingerie.

771
01:02:13,150 --> 01:02:16,195
Help!

772
01:02:34,922 --> 01:02:38,717
You go low. I'm going high.

773
01:02:59,863 --> 01:03:01,782
We'll never find this damn thing.

774
01:03:02,032 --> 01:03:03,617
I lost him!

775
01:03:03,867 --> 01:03:08,247
How do you lose a 20-foot bird in a mall?

776
01:03:09,540 --> 01:03:11,625
I don't know.

777
01:03:11,875 --> 01:03:15,004
What do we do now?

778
01:03:25,973 --> 01:03:27,808
Wayne.

779
01:03:28,058 --> 01:03:32,396
I think we've established that
"ca-caw" and "tookie-tookie" don't work.

780
01:03:32,646 --> 01:03:35,649
Right. Sorry.

781
01:03:35,899 --> 01:03:40,446
So what do you say, Ira? Pack it in?

782
01:03:47,911 --> 01:03:49,705
Step back. I'm going to shoot him.

783
01:03:49,955 --> 01:03:53,751
Stand down. I'll kill this one myself.

784
01:03:54,001 --> 01:03:57,880
Give me a chance.
I'm communicating here.

785
01:04:03,761 --> 01:04:08,974
Wayne, please stop.
You are embarrassing me.

786
01:04:30,955 --> 01:04:32,456
It's working.

787
01:04:32,706 --> 01:04:36,251
Sing. Rub some funk on it.

788
01:04:44,134 --> 01:04:48,847
Here he comes!
You grab the girl, I'll get the bird.

789
01:05:17,584 --> 01:05:20,421
All right! Nice shot!

790
01:05:20,671 --> 01:05:23,424
I am so sorry. I swear to God...

791
01:05:23,674 --> 01:05:26,593
...I will never shoplift again.

792
01:05:26,844 --> 01:05:29,638
Good.

793
01:05:38,355 --> 01:05:41,609
So what do you want, light meat or dark?

794
01:05:41,859 --> 01:05:44,903
You have to ask?

795
01:05:50,534 --> 01:05:53,871
It's dead now.

796
01:06:36,956 --> 01:06:40,668
<i>I'm standing at the edge of
the Valley Vista housing community...</i>

797
01:06:40,918 --> 01:06:46,173
<i>... where just below me are dozens of giant,
odd-looking, dead creatures.</i>

798
01:06:46,423 --> 01:06:50,511
<i>We should stress that, to this point,
we have had no official word from...</i>

799
01:06:50,761 --> 01:06:55,849
<i>This ugly tentacle came out of the ground
and tried to grab my private parts.</i>

800
01:06:56,100 --> 01:06:58,269
<i>I batted it away. It got my hand.</i>

801
01:06:58,519 --> 01:07:01,605
<i>There is anxiety and confusion
in the Glen Canyon area.</i>

802
01:07:01,855 --> 01:07:06,860
<i>We're outside the state capitol building
awaiting comment from the Governor...</i>

803
01:07:07,111 --> 01:07:12,992
<i>... concerning the nature and origin
of these extraordinary creatures.</i>

804
01:07:25,296 --> 01:07:27,381
Governor Lewis, this way.

805
01:07:27,631 --> 01:07:30,134
Can someone tell me
why I was not informed...

806
01:07:30,384 --> 01:07:33,178
...that we have aliens
crawling all over my beloved state?

807
01:07:33,429 --> 01:07:36,557
Right now, 400 media vultures
are camped outside my office.

808
01:07:36,807 --> 01:07:38,851
They know more about this than I do.

809
01:07:39,101 --> 01:07:42,187
I should throw the bunch of you
into prison.

810
01:07:42,438 --> 01:07:47,109
Not the cushy federal place with jumpsuits.
State prison, with crotch binders.

811
01:07:47,359 --> 01:07:52,114
I'm sorry, but there were earlier security
breaches by Dr. Kane and his team.

812
01:07:52,364 --> 01:07:54,700
Wait a minute. No, no. Excuse me.

813
01:07:54,950 --> 01:07:57,620
That's not exactly true, Gen. Woodman.

814
01:07:57,870 --> 01:08:00,456
I believe the Governor's question
was directed at me.

815
01:08:00,706 --> 01:08:03,751
Put a plug in it!
I'm not interested in bureaucratic crapola.

816
01:08:04,001 --> 01:08:06,545
I want to know how bad this thing is.

817
01:08:06,795 --> 01:08:09,048
It's bad, Governor.

818
01:08:09,298 --> 01:08:13,552
According to the new ground sensors
and satellite thermal scans...

819
01:08:13,802 --> 01:08:16,889
...they indicate a potential problem.

820
01:08:17,139 --> 01:08:19,308
I can't read this. What kind of problem?

821
01:08:19,558 --> 01:08:22,478
Someone take this bag of snakes
and lay them out straight.

822
01:08:22,728 --> 01:08:23,729
Allow me.

823
01:08:23,979 --> 01:08:26,023
- And you are?
- Dr. Allison Reed.

824
01:08:26,273 --> 01:08:29,234
Carla? Would you mind?

825
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:35,866
The red markings indicate the growth
of the alien ecosystem.

826
01:08:37,326 --> 01:08:42,247
Unless we act immediately,
we will lose Glen Canyon in three days.

827
01:08:42,498 --> 01:08:44,750
Great merciful Christ.

828
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,419
In a week, the rest of Arizona.

829
01:08:47,670 --> 01:08:50,589
Then, the entire southwest.

830
01:08:50,839 --> 01:08:55,094
In two months, the United States
officially belongs to them.

831
01:08:55,344 --> 01:08:57,137
And we are extinct.

832
01:08:57,388 --> 01:09:00,391
You must be shitting me!

833
01:09:04,812 --> 01:09:07,606
Admit it. You're glad to see us.

834
01:09:07,856 --> 01:09:10,943
Yes, I am. Call the MP's.
Have them arrested.

835
01:09:11,193 --> 01:09:15,948
We just blew a giant alien bird out of
a store. We're covering up your mess.

836
01:09:16,198 --> 01:09:18,784
I'm Dr. Ira Kane,
chairman of the science department...

837
01:09:19,034 --> 01:09:22,121
...Glen Canyon Community College.
This is my associate.

838
01:09:22,371 --> 01:09:26,375
Harry Block, adjunct professor of geology.
Voted for you.

839
01:09:26,625 --> 01:09:31,380
Wayne Gray.
I took some chemistry in high school.

840
01:09:32,923 --> 01:09:36,135
You two are the original discoverers
of the phenomena, correct?

841
01:09:36,385 --> 01:09:40,055
Yes, and they're also responsible
for the mess we're in now.

842
01:09:40,306 --> 01:09:41,307
Here we go.

843
01:09:41,557 --> 01:09:44,685
They broke into the contained area,
breaching security procedures.

844
01:09:44,935 --> 01:09:48,647
Disseminating the alien organisms
outside the secured area.

845
01:09:48,897 --> 01:09:50,232
Liar, liar, pants on fire!

846
01:09:50,482 --> 01:09:52,151
Criminal charges are in order!

847
01:09:52,401 --> 01:09:54,069
- This is bullshit!
- It is not!

848
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:55,863
Shut up all of you! Listen.

849
01:09:56,113 --> 01:09:58,324
My state is being overrun by aliens.

850
01:09:58,574 --> 01:10:02,661
Now you're supposed to be experts.
I want to know, and quick:

851
01:10:02,911 --> 01:10:05,331
How will you deal with this?

852
01:10:05,581 --> 01:10:10,836
This is an outline of the infected area
as of this afternoon.

853
01:10:11,086 --> 01:10:15,841
My plan is to evacuate everyone
from within five miles of the perimeter.

854
01:10:16,091 --> 01:10:18,177
You're talking about 10,000 people.

855
01:10:18,427 --> 01:10:21,347
Yes, sir. We evacuate, make it safe...

856
01:10:21,597 --> 01:10:24,516
...then burn the alien menace
the hell out of there.

857
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:27,019
With what?

858
01:10:27,269 --> 01:10:30,856
With napalm. Lots and lots of napalm.

859
01:10:31,106 --> 01:10:34,193
Napalm? Why don't you just nuke them?

860
01:10:34,443 --> 01:10:36,028
What about nukes?

861
01:10:36,278 --> 01:10:39,281
Nobody's dropping an H-bomb on my state.

862
01:10:39,531 --> 01:10:42,743
All this talk about napalm
and burning makes me nervous.

863
01:10:42,993 --> 01:10:46,872
And we don't know how they'd react
to such an attack on a cellular level.

864
01:10:47,122 --> 01:10:50,918
Governor, it's time for a military solution.
This will work.

865
01:10:51,168 --> 01:10:56,382
General? Sorry to interrupt.
You better take a look at this.

866
01:11:01,261 --> 01:11:02,346
What?

867
01:11:02,596 --> 01:11:04,181
You called me out for this?

868
01:11:04,431 --> 01:11:07,184
Sir, one of the creatures
just destroyed video four.

869
01:11:07,434 --> 01:11:11,146
What's going on down there?

870
01:11:12,940 --> 01:11:17,653
My God. They've evolved into primates.

871
01:11:17,945 --> 01:11:21,657
That's a face for radio.

872
01:11:34,461 --> 01:11:36,714
They took out six and seven.

873
01:11:36,964 --> 01:11:38,716
All the monitors are down.

874
01:11:38,966 --> 01:11:41,552
Well, that can't be good.

875
01:11:41,802 --> 01:11:44,388
That's the elevator.

876
01:11:44,638 --> 01:11:46,724
We have no personnel down there.

877
01:11:46,974 --> 01:11:48,976
They breached the air lock.

878
01:11:49,226 --> 01:11:51,770
The fuzzy no-nose chimp?

879
01:11:52,021 --> 01:11:54,648
Call for backup.

880
01:11:55,482 --> 01:11:56,817
We need backup!

881
01:11:57,067 --> 01:12:00,404
They're coming through the elevator!

882
01:12:00,654 --> 01:12:02,573
They're coming through the elevator!

883
01:12:02,823 --> 01:12:05,159
- Cover the elevator!
- Give me a sidearm!

884
01:12:05,409 --> 01:12:07,661
Okay, just stay behind me!

885
01:12:07,911 --> 01:12:11,290
Get off me! I want to see!

886
01:12:15,586 --> 01:12:18,672
Be prepared to fire.

887
01:12:32,853 --> 01:12:35,898
It's empty, sir.

888
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:52,206
The Governor! Don't shoot!

889
01:12:52,456 --> 01:12:54,917
Help!

890
01:13:04,218 --> 01:13:05,469
Do something!

891
01:13:05,719 --> 01:13:09,890
Hold your fire. You'll get someone killed.

892
01:13:33,163 --> 01:13:34,581
Nice shot.

893
01:13:34,832 --> 01:13:37,793
I'll take that now.

894
01:13:42,006 --> 01:13:45,676
You have my full support
to do whatever you need to do...

895
01:13:45,926 --> 01:13:47,553
...however much firepower it takes.

896
01:13:47,803 --> 01:13:51,432
Melt the place down to beaded glass,
if that's what it takes.

897
01:13:51,682 --> 01:13:53,767
Get these hellish creazoids
out of my state!

898
01:13:54,018 --> 01:13:56,854
Thank you, Governor.
I'll be ready to go by noon tomorrow.

899
01:13:57,104 --> 01:13:58,272
Good, sir.

900
01:13:58,522 --> 01:14:01,066
- Where've you two been?
- Just getting out of the way...

901
01:14:01,317 --> 01:14:03,652
Get me out of here.

902
01:14:03,902 --> 01:14:05,946
Science project is over.

903
01:14:06,196 --> 01:14:09,283
I want you and your people gone.

904
01:14:09,533 --> 01:14:13,412
Soldier, escort these men out.

905
01:14:18,709 --> 01:14:21,462
Don't you have work to do?

906
01:14:21,712 --> 01:14:25,341
You are such an asshole.

907
01:14:28,218 --> 01:14:30,638
When a woman expresses anger,
it's often because...

908
01:14:30,888 --> 01:14:34,308
Shut up, Flemming.

909
01:14:34,558 --> 01:14:39,438
Okay. I know where the car is.

910
01:14:39,563 --> 01:14:41,482
Wipe my ass, too.

911
01:14:41,732 --> 01:14:45,110
Hey, guys!

912
01:14:45,819 --> 01:14:48,155
Got room for one more?

913
01:14:48,405 --> 01:14:50,157
Hell, yeah.

914
01:14:50,407 --> 01:14:52,660
Who wants to be deputy director
of the CDC, anyway?

915
01:14:52,910 --> 01:14:56,538
The real money's in the private sector.

916
01:14:56,664 --> 01:14:59,667
- Are you sure about this?
- Oh, yeah.

917
01:14:59,917 --> 01:15:01,961
Listen, it may not seem like much now...

918
01:15:02,211 --> 01:15:07,091
...but I got your research files
and original samples.

919
01:15:07,091 --> 01:15:08,509
So...

920
01:15:08,759 --> 01:15:13,347
...if we survive this,
you guys will get the credit.

921
01:15:16,100 --> 01:15:17,184
Thank you.

922
01:15:17,434 --> 01:15:19,186
- It's nothing.
- Let me get it.

923
01:15:19,436 --> 01:15:22,273
No, I got it.

924
01:15:26,193 --> 01:15:27,569
Sorry. Excuse me.

925
01:15:27,820 --> 01:15:30,614
We haven't been formally introduced.
I'm Wayne Gray.

926
01:15:30,864 --> 01:15:32,616
I'm kind of with him.

927
01:15:32,866 --> 01:15:36,078
That's cool.

928
01:15:36,578 --> 01:15:38,330
Buckle up, Allison. We're rolling.

929
01:15:38,580 --> 01:15:41,375
Oh, my goodness!

930
01:15:44,128 --> 01:15:47,089
<i>Facilities are being provided for you
and your families.</i>

931
01:15:47,339 --> 01:15:51,343
<i>Please move in an orderly fashion.</i>

932
01:15:59,727 --> 01:16:02,646
They're going to blow up the whole town.

933
01:16:02,896 --> 01:16:05,566
Hey! Hold on!

934
01:16:05,816 --> 01:16:09,111
Where the hell you going?

935
01:16:25,002 --> 01:16:28,047
<i>We need to clear this area, people.</i>

936
01:16:28,297 --> 01:16:33,510
<i>For your own safety,
evacuate immediately.</i>

937
01:16:48,067 --> 01:16:49,151
Professor Kane!

938
01:16:49,401 --> 01:16:52,529
Arizona! It's going down, baby!

939
01:16:52,780 --> 01:16:57,117
This may not be the best time
to be drinking.

940
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:07,461
I was your first. We discovered you
in that cave. You were scared and alone.

941
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:09,296
It was just you, me and Harry.

942
01:17:09,546 --> 01:17:11,966
Those were good times.

943
01:17:12,216 --> 01:17:14,802
So, why not level with me now?

944
01:17:15,052 --> 01:17:18,180
You can trust me. Just talk to me.

945
01:17:18,430 --> 01:17:23,686
Tell me the secret. Tell me the answer.
Tell me how to kill you.

946
01:17:23,936 --> 01:17:26,355
You are losing it, pal.

947
01:17:26,605 --> 01:17:29,191
What is that stuff anyway?

948
01:17:29,441 --> 01:17:32,361
Some of the original liquid material
from inside the meteor.

949
01:17:32,611 --> 01:17:37,700
- Why hasn't it evolved like the rest?
- I don't know. Maybe being refrigerated?

950
01:17:37,950 --> 01:17:44,623
Being in an airtight case, nothing to
metabolise with. But we've still no clue...

951
01:17:47,126 --> 01:17:48,794
When did you start smoking?

952
01:17:49,044 --> 01:17:52,965
Not much of a point
to clean living anymore.

953
01:18:17,823 --> 01:18:20,492
They react to fire like it was Miracle-Gro.

954
01:18:20,743 --> 01:18:22,828
Fire.

955
01:18:23,078 --> 01:18:27,499
The organisms were dormant in space.
They hit Earth's atmosphere and bam!

956
01:18:27,750 --> 01:18:31,086
Heat. Fire. That's the catalyst.

957
01:18:31,337 --> 01:18:34,673
So if a tiny match catalyses
this stuff like this...

958
01:18:34,923 --> 01:18:37,343
...what's a ton of napalm going to do?

959
01:18:37,593 --> 01:18:41,221
So much for the military option.

960
01:18:46,435 --> 01:18:49,647
Better call that dick general.

961
01:18:53,609 --> 01:18:57,529
- That's a lot of napalm.
- Yes, it is.

962
01:18:57,780 --> 01:19:01,200
We're going to blow those creatures
straight to hell.

963
01:19:01,450 --> 01:19:05,079
We'll flush them out along the mine shafts
then mop up the edges as they...

964
01:19:05,329 --> 01:19:06,956
...run trying to escape the flames.

965
01:19:07,206 --> 01:19:10,376
Excuse me, sir.
There's an urgent call from Dr. Reed.

966
01:19:10,626 --> 01:19:13,295
She says she has important information
about the mission.

967
01:19:13,545 --> 01:19:18,717
Oh, really?
Well, unfortunately, I'm not available.

968
01:19:23,305 --> 01:19:24,890
Anything more?

969
01:19:25,140 --> 01:19:27,851
No, sir.

970
01:19:32,815 --> 01:19:35,150
He blew me off. Can you believe it?

971
01:19:35,401 --> 01:19:39,571
- He wouldn't even take my call.
- You did call him an asshole.

972
01:19:39,822 --> 01:19:41,240
Dr. K!

973
01:19:41,490 --> 01:19:43,158
- We got beer!
- Time to party!

974
01:19:43,409 --> 01:19:46,078
- I'll take one of those.
- Me, too. I just quit smoking.

975
01:19:46,328 --> 01:19:48,080
What are you boys doing here?

976
01:19:48,330 --> 01:19:50,749
Thought you could use a brew
so you can mellow out.

977
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,210
Kick back and chill.

978
01:19:53,460 --> 01:19:55,921
Have a beer, relax.
It'll help with your research.

979
01:19:56,171 --> 01:19:58,924
Yeah, help with your research.

980
01:19:59,174 --> 01:20:01,844
Look at that thing.

981
01:20:02,094 --> 01:20:04,388
Can we have that
when you're done with it?

982
01:20:04,638 --> 01:20:08,100
Fellas, thanks for the beers,
but we're working.

983
01:20:08,350 --> 01:20:10,936
Hold it.

984
01:20:11,437 --> 01:20:13,105
- Look.
- What are you doing?

985
01:20:13,355 --> 01:20:15,733
Selenium. It could be the answer.

986
01:20:15,983 --> 01:20:20,237
I'm looking at the periodic table
on your T-shirt. I'm seeing a pattern.

987
01:20:20,487 --> 01:20:21,905
Take off your shirt.

988
01:20:22,156 --> 01:20:23,198
Yes.

989
01:20:23,449 --> 01:20:25,451
- No.
- All right, look.

990
01:20:25,701 --> 01:20:28,037
We are a carbon-based life form.

991
01:20:28,287 --> 01:20:29,455
Keep pulling.

992
01:20:29,705 --> 01:20:33,292
We move down here
and you find our poison: Arsenic.

993
01:20:33,542 --> 01:20:35,961
But the aliens are nitrogen-based, right?

994
01:20:36,211 --> 01:20:37,421
You make the same move...

995
01:20:37,671 --> 01:20:43,052
...down and over,
and where do you find yourself?

996
01:20:43,218 --> 01:20:45,095
Selenium.

997
01:20:45,346 --> 01:20:47,806
It could be as lethal to them
as arsenic is to us.

998
01:20:48,057 --> 01:20:52,478
With their metabolic rates,
it'll kill them fast.

999
01:20:53,896 --> 01:20:57,942
Selenium. How much do we need?

1000
01:20:59,735 --> 01:21:02,404
Five hundred gallons should do it.

1001
01:21:02,655 --> 01:21:05,866
Five hundred gallons?

1002
01:21:05,950 --> 01:21:09,662
I hate to be a buzzkill,
but where will we get that at 2:00 a.m.?

1003
01:21:09,912 --> 01:21:11,497
No problem.

1004
01:21:11,747 --> 01:21:14,792
We can get that.

1005
01:21:17,378 --> 01:21:18,837
Head & Shoulders.

1006
01:21:19,088 --> 01:21:20,339
The dandruff shampoo?

1007
01:21:20,589 --> 01:21:25,761
Yeah, that's the stuff.
The active ingredient is selenium sulphide.

1008
01:21:27,930 --> 01:21:30,182
How do you know that?
You don't know anything.

1009
01:21:30,432 --> 01:21:35,396
Haven't you noticed
how shiny and flake-free our hair is?

1010
01:21:38,274 --> 01:21:41,527
Okay, this is the best idea we got.

1011
01:21:41,777 --> 01:21:44,488
Let's give it a shot. Come on.

1012
01:21:44,738 --> 01:21:47,366
We'll get the troops together.
We're getting shampoo!

1013
01:21:47,616 --> 01:21:49,285
I have the perfect vehicle.

1014
01:21:49,535 --> 01:21:54,915
Good! Donalds, you just got your A's.

1015
01:22:02,881 --> 01:22:05,634
Almost full.

1016
01:22:08,971 --> 01:22:13,892
There's something I should tell you,
but I don't know exactly how.

1017
01:22:14,143 --> 01:22:20,190
Just say it. We're adults and we're
about to die a horrible death soon anyway.

1018
01:22:21,150 --> 01:22:25,029
I would have rocked your world.

1019
01:22:28,866 --> 01:22:31,243
- You already have.
- All full.

1020
01:22:31,493 --> 01:22:35,205
Battle stations!

1021
01:22:36,999 --> 01:22:40,878
Can we continue this discussion later?

1022
01:22:41,253 --> 01:22:44,131
Let's do this!

1023
01:22:44,506 --> 01:22:47,760
Let's shampoo us some aliens!

1024
01:23:06,278 --> 01:23:09,490
Lots of soldiers around.

1025
01:23:14,161 --> 01:23:19,166
There's an old mine half a click south.
We can sneak into the cave through there.

1026
01:23:19,416 --> 01:23:21,585
"Half a click"? What are you, in Vietnam?

1027
01:23:21,835 --> 01:23:26,340
Hey, I'm digging this. Work with me.

1028
01:23:44,316 --> 01:23:48,612
It's over here! It's right here!

1029
01:23:50,447 --> 01:23:53,867
- Are you okay?
- I'm good.

1030
01:23:54,076 --> 01:23:55,327
Let's go!

1031
01:23:55,577 --> 01:23:57,788
Let's do this.

1032
01:23:58,038 --> 01:23:59,915
You sure this leads to the main cavern?

1033
01:24:00,165 --> 01:24:04,461
It'll lead somewhere.
Geology's not an exact science.

1034
01:24:06,422 --> 01:24:08,841
Where are you?

1035
01:24:09,091 --> 01:24:11,885
Where are you, my little aliens?

1036
01:24:12,136 --> 01:24:15,180
Show yourself.

1037
01:24:24,023 --> 01:24:27,318
Warm to the touch.

1038
01:24:29,612 --> 01:24:31,196
Highly acidic.

1039
01:24:31,447 --> 01:24:34,450
We've no time for you
to act like you know what you're doing.

1040
01:24:34,700 --> 01:24:35,909
What happened to the respect?

1041
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:40,247
Woodman's going at noon.
We have to hurry.

1042
01:24:42,374 --> 01:24:45,210
- Good. Are the troops in place?
- Ahead of schedule.

1043
01:24:45,461 --> 01:24:48,213
Excellent. We can go early.

1044
01:24:48,464 --> 01:24:52,843
Oh, no. What is he doing here?

1045
01:24:54,470 --> 01:24:55,804
Governor Lewis.

1046
01:24:56,055 --> 01:24:58,933
I don't see anything burning.
Where are all the explosions?

1047
01:24:59,183 --> 01:25:02,478
We're just getting underway.
I didn't know you were coming to watch.

1048
01:25:02,728 --> 01:25:05,230
Well, better make it a good one, Sergeant.

1049
01:25:05,481 --> 01:25:06,815
That's General.

1050
01:25:07,066 --> 01:25:11,153
Not if you screw this up.
Keeping my chair warm for me?

1051
01:25:11,403 --> 01:25:13,238
Thank you.

1052
01:25:13,489 --> 01:25:16,033
I'll take a pair of spy glasses
and a hot chocolate.

1053
01:25:16,283 --> 01:25:18,077
Give me the hose.

1054
01:25:18,327 --> 01:25:22,706
Get up top. When I give the signal,
start pumping the selenium.

1055
01:25:22,957 --> 01:25:25,918
Got it.

1056
01:25:44,103 --> 01:25:46,689
We'll spray all around the meteor...

1057
01:25:46,939 --> 01:25:51,068
...then get out of here as fast as we can.

1058
01:25:52,861 --> 01:25:56,407
Blue monkey!

1059
01:25:57,032 --> 01:26:00,911
Wayne, charge the line now!

1060
01:26:09,211 --> 01:26:10,879
That's the napalm!

1061
01:26:11,130 --> 01:26:14,174
Woodman went early.

1062
01:26:23,225 --> 01:26:25,227
Bad!

1063
01:26:25,477 --> 01:26:28,564
Wayne, come on!

1064
01:26:30,065 --> 01:26:32,943
I'm out.

1065
01:26:39,241 --> 01:26:42,536
We've got to go!

1066
01:26:43,746 --> 01:26:48,792
Go! Faster! Get up there!

1067
01:26:49,501 --> 01:26:53,047
Run for your life!

1068
01:26:56,926 --> 01:27:00,596
Quite a bonfire we've got.
Should have brought some wieners.

1069
01:27:00,846 --> 01:27:02,181
That can be arranged.

1070
01:27:02,431 --> 01:27:07,311
- First reports are excellent, sir.
- Very good.

1071
01:27:08,854 --> 01:27:12,107
Keep it together, Wayne.

1072
01:27:12,441 --> 01:27:15,152
Oh, my God.

1073
01:27:21,533 --> 01:27:24,495
What's happening?

1074
01:27:24,536 --> 01:27:27,998
- It's coming!
- What's coming?

1075
01:27:28,499 --> 01:27:31,001
Get the hell out of here!

1076
01:27:31,293 --> 01:27:35,881
- Great flaming whore balls!
- General, look!

1077
01:27:49,561 --> 01:27:51,146
Hurry!

1078
01:27:51,397 --> 01:27:54,275
- Drive!
- Go!

1079
01:27:54,525 --> 01:27:57,736
All right!

1080
01:28:48,454 --> 01:28:51,999
Fall back!

1081
01:28:55,502 --> 01:28:57,421
What the hell is that thing?

1082
01:28:57,671 --> 01:29:03,093
The napalm forced an evolutionary
response, like the match in the petri dish.

1083
01:29:03,344 --> 01:29:04,762
That's evolution?

1084
01:29:05,012 --> 01:29:09,350
Survival of the fittest. Often,
the simplest organism is the strongest.

1085
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:11,435
Guys? It's freaking out!

1086
01:29:11,685 --> 01:29:15,773
It's starting to have
some sort of spaz attack.

1087
01:29:16,023 --> 01:29:19,610
That's not spazzing out.

1088
01:29:19,860 --> 01:29:23,155
It's getting ready to divide.

1089
01:29:26,200 --> 01:29:28,035
Mitosis.

1090
01:29:28,285 --> 01:29:31,455
Wait. There's going to be more
of these things?

1091
01:29:31,705 --> 01:29:35,125
- A lot more.
- Its cycle is starting again.

1092
01:29:35,376 --> 01:29:39,630
It will go on growing and doubling
until it takes over.

1093
01:29:39,880 --> 01:29:43,425
But we were here first.

1094
01:29:44,051 --> 01:29:49,306
So that Head & Shoulders idea.
Is that still the plan?

1095
01:29:52,059 --> 01:29:53,060
I'm driving.

1096
01:29:53,310 --> 01:29:56,981
So what if he's on "Air Force One"?
It has phones. I've seen them!

1097
01:29:57,231 --> 01:30:01,026
I don't think this can wait an hour.

1098
01:30:01,318 --> 01:30:05,281
What's that fire truck doing out there?

1099
01:30:20,129 --> 01:30:22,881
Mama.

1100
01:30:28,762 --> 01:30:30,514
Can you believe this?

1101
01:30:30,764 --> 01:30:34,893
We have to find a point of attack.

1102
01:30:38,272 --> 01:30:41,150
There!

1103
01:30:48,449 --> 01:30:49,867
Nasty!

1104
01:30:50,117 --> 01:30:53,996
Allison, stop. Right here.

1105
01:30:55,456 --> 01:30:57,541
Here we go!

1106
01:30:57,791 --> 01:31:01,003
Get the ladder up!

1107
01:31:01,045 --> 01:31:03,297
Feed me the hose, Deke.

1108
01:31:03,547 --> 01:31:05,883
- What are you doing?
- Going up top.

1109
01:31:06,133 --> 01:31:09,219
Not before me.
I got a major score to settle.

1110
01:31:09,470 --> 01:31:12,681
Go, go, go!

1111
01:31:27,321 --> 01:31:32,368
We don't have much time, guys! Hurry!

1112
01:31:36,664 --> 01:31:38,749
- Left!
- Left!

1113
01:31:38,999 --> 01:31:43,379
Got it.
I haven't had much practice with this.

1114
01:31:45,506 --> 01:31:49,218
Stop!

1115
01:31:50,803 --> 01:31:53,639
- What's going on?
- I don't know, but it's getting bigger.

1116
01:31:53,889 --> 01:31:58,269
What are they doing with that ladder?

1117
01:31:58,435 --> 01:32:02,439
Looks like they're getting ready
to administer a jumbo enema.

1118
01:32:02,690 --> 01:32:05,609
We got one shot. Let's do this.

1119
01:32:05,859 --> 01:32:10,072
It's payback time!

1120
01:32:13,367 --> 01:32:14,952
Keep it in there!

1121
01:32:15,202 --> 01:32:18,455
What's it look like I'm doing?

1122
01:32:18,706 --> 01:32:22,084
It's working!

1123
01:32:26,463 --> 01:32:29,341
Shit!

1124
01:32:29,967 --> 01:32:31,135
What the hell?

1125
01:32:31,385 --> 01:32:33,637
Oh, my God!

1126
01:32:33,887 --> 01:32:36,974
Give me back my friend, you big sphincter!

1127
01:32:37,224 --> 01:32:38,559
She's going to blow!

1128
01:32:38,809 --> 01:32:39,893
Stop kicking!

1129
01:32:40,144 --> 01:32:41,979
It's horrible in here!

1130
01:32:42,229 --> 01:32:44,815
- I got you!
- Help me!

1131
01:32:45,065 --> 01:32:49,278
Hold me, Ira! Don't let me go!

1132
01:32:51,530 --> 01:32:54,283
We have to get out of here!
This thing's going to blow!

1133
01:32:54,533 --> 01:32:56,994
You cannot imagine what I saw in there!

1134
01:32:57,244 --> 01:32:58,537
Hurry up, guys!

1135
01:32:58,787 --> 01:33:03,208
Ira! Don't you ever tell anyone
where I've been!

1136
01:33:03,459 --> 01:33:06,086
Dear Lord.

1137
01:33:10,299 --> 01:33:13,510
Uh-oh. Time to go.

1138
01:33:14,720 --> 01:33:17,514
Go!

1139
01:33:39,453 --> 01:33:42,331
We did it!

1140
01:34:16,365 --> 01:34:21,370
Here we go, sir. Just relax
and we'll have you as good as new.

1141
01:34:21,620 --> 01:34:25,457
I am happy to report
that all remaining traces...

1142
01:34:25,708 --> 01:34:27,876
...of the alien menace
have been eradicated...

1143
01:34:28,127 --> 01:34:31,297
...using the selenium shampoo formula
developed right here.

1144
01:34:31,547 --> 01:34:35,718
Let me introduce our civilian scientist
heroes and their team...

1145
01:34:35,968 --> 01:34:42,182
...the best the great state of Arizona
has been privileged to produce.

1146
01:34:44,393 --> 01:34:49,982
So this is your moment. You wouldn't
want to miss this for anything.

1147
01:34:50,232 --> 01:34:55,321
Firstly, I would like you all
to meet Wayne Gray.

1148
01:34:55,571 --> 01:34:59,658
As of today, a fully credentialed fire-fighter.

1149
01:34:59,908 --> 01:35:01,994
I spoke to the chief.

1150
01:35:02,244 --> 01:35:05,205
Thanks, Governor.

1151
01:35:07,249 --> 01:35:08,584
Now, our next hero...

1152
01:35:08,834 --> 01:35:11,712
...Professor Harry Block, noted geologist...

1153
01:35:11,962 --> 01:35:14,840
...and winningest coach
in north Arizona women's volleyball.

1154
01:35:15,090 --> 01:35:17,009
I appreciate that, Governor.

1155
01:35:17,259 --> 01:35:20,346
First, I thank God.
With Him, all things are possible.

1156
01:35:20,596 --> 01:35:24,266
We just played tough defence,
took it one alien at a time...

1157
01:35:24,516 --> 01:35:28,145
...and came away with the big W.

1158
01:35:32,441 --> 01:35:34,360
And finally...

1159
01:35:34,610 --> 01:35:37,363
...Doctors Ira Kane and Allison Reed...

1160
01:35:37,613 --> 01:35:43,369
...whose tireless efforts, research,
and academic findings led to the...

1161
01:35:43,619 --> 01:35:47,831
I think he's giving her
a bit of the Kane Madness.

1162
01:36:00,886 --> 01:36:03,973
Fighting the alien menace
can be tough work.

1163
01:36:04,223 --> 01:36:06,934
So is keeping your hair clean,
shiny and dandruff-free.

1164
01:36:07,184 --> 01:36:10,271
So we always keep a healthy supply of...

1165
01:36:10,521 --> 01:36:14,233
...Head & Shoulders around the house.
