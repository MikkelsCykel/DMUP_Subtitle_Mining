<i>Hello?</i>

2
00:00:15,462 --> 00:00:17,623
<i>Hello? Who is this?</i>

3
00:00:18,198 --> 00:00:19,927
<i>Why do you keep calling?</i>

4
00:00:49,463 --> 00:00:50,987
Hey.

5
00:00:51,732 --> 00:00:53,290
I know you.

6
00:00:54,268 --> 00:00:56,793
No, I don't think so.

7
00:01:04,978 --> 00:01:07,503
Oh, look, there's Sammy's mom.

8
00:01:07,681 --> 00:01:09,649
- Hi, Sammy's mom.
- Hi.

9
00:01:09,817 --> 00:01:11,648
We're just bringing you
some cookies.

10
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:13,480
- We heard you got a new kitten.
- Yeah.

11
00:01:13,654 --> 00:01:16,521
Max would love to come over
and see it soon, wouldn't you, babe?

12
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:18,681
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Want a cookie?

13
00:01:18,859 --> 00:01:20,884
No, thanks.

14
00:01:21,061 --> 00:01:23,495
Marla, sorry about the construction.

15
00:01:23,664 --> 00:01:25,256
I know it's been really noisy.

16
00:01:25,632 --> 00:01:27,122
See you.

17
00:01:27,734 --> 00:01:29,725
<i>You care too much</i>
<i>what people think.</i>

18
00:01:30,504 --> 00:01:32,131
But we're friends. It's...

19
00:01:32,306 --> 00:01:35,104
We've had so many play dates
together. It was crazy.

20
00:01:35,275 --> 00:01:37,869
So she's in a bad mood.
Who cares?

21
00:01:38,045 --> 00:01:40,138
I care.

22
00:01:40,314 --> 00:01:44,114
Just because you can remove yourself
to feel superior, doesn't mean I can.

23
00:01:44,751 --> 00:01:46,184
What the hell is that?

24
00:01:46,353 --> 00:01:49,345
It's what you do
so you're never affected by people.

25
00:02:34,234 --> 00:02:35,929
I can take the next customer.

26
00:02:38,505 --> 00:02:39,995
No, no, no. Wait. Excuse me.

27
00:02:40,474 --> 00:02:42,908
- I was next.
- No, you weren't.

28
00:02:43,677 --> 00:02:46,441
But you can't do that. Hey.

29
00:02:46,613 --> 00:02:50,413
- I was waiting in line. It's not right.
- Let me help them, then I'll help you.

30
00:02:52,619 --> 00:02:54,348
You see that?
Were they in front of me?

31
00:02:55,055 --> 00:02:58,115
No. This is crazy.
I've been waiting in line.

32
00:02:58,926 --> 00:03:00,860
How important could
being in front of me be?

33
00:03:01,028 --> 00:03:03,496
- Calm down.
- Really. What kind of person are you?

34
00:03:03,664 --> 00:03:06,792
Feel you got away with something?
Is this really worth it to you?

35
00:03:06,967 --> 00:03:09,128
Sorry, could you step over there,
wait your turn?

36
00:03:09,303 --> 00:03:12,136
- Seriously.
- Is there a manager here?

37
00:03:12,306 --> 00:03:14,604
- Is there a manager here?
- I'm the manager.

38
00:03:14,808 --> 00:03:16,605
How can I help you?
Everything all right?

39
00:03:16,777 --> 00:03:19,746
Everything's not all right.
These two people cut in front of me.

40
00:03:19,913 --> 00:03:21,938
Everyone is letting them
get away with it.

41
00:03:22,616 --> 00:03:25,380
Them. There. Those two people
with their stupid fucking faces.

42
00:03:25,552 --> 00:03:28,749
I'm sorry. I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave the store, ma'am.

43
00:03:29,323 --> 00:03:32,554
Me, you kick out,
and to them you do nothing?

44
00:03:32,726 --> 00:03:35,126
Let's go, ma'am. I'm sorry.

45
00:03:35,596 --> 00:03:36,858
Just let me buy what I need.

46
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,861
I don't think that's going to happen.

47
00:03:39,032 --> 00:03:41,865
Well, then take it all, then!

48
00:03:45,606 --> 00:03:48,575
On top of it, I don't get the part...

49
00:03:48,742 --> 00:03:51,575
...where the guy tells the other guy
not to come to the house.

50
00:03:51,745 --> 00:03:53,940
No, no. I don't think
you're supposed to get it.

51
00:03:54,114 --> 00:03:56,981
It's like... It's deliberately confusing.

52
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,378
Really? You sure?

53
00:03:58,552 --> 00:04:02,044
I... I don't know what I'm saying.

54
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:04,216
Are you hungry?

55
00:04:04,391 --> 00:04:07,360
Yeah, I'm starving. Let's... Should
we go and find somewhere to eat?

56
00:04:07,527 --> 00:04:10,223
I actually... Just earlier today
I went to a farmers' market.

57
00:04:10,397 --> 00:04:13,560
I live right up the street. So, I mean,
I could make us something.

58
00:04:13,734 --> 00:04:16,635
- Oh, listen, I don't want to impose.
- No. Please, I love to cook.

59
00:04:16,803 --> 00:04:18,566
I would... It would be my pleasure.

60
00:04:18,739 --> 00:04:21,435
You've got such a great place.

61
00:04:21,608 --> 00:04:25,203
Your paintings and stuff.
Did your wife decorate or did you?

62
00:04:25,379 --> 00:04:29,475
You know, my wife pretends to be
interested in that stuff, but she's not.

63
00:04:29,816 --> 00:04:32,114
I ended up doing the whole thing
myself pretty much.

64
00:04:32,285 --> 00:04:34,776
My wife's into her designing,
but I did the house.

65
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:37,514
I think we're ready.
Do you mind grabbing that?

66
00:04:37,691 --> 00:04:40,091
- No.
- Thank you.

67
00:04:40,894 --> 00:04:43,260
So how long
have you guys been married?

68
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:44,454
Eight and a half years.

69
00:04:44,631 --> 00:04:45,962
- Really?
- Yeah.

70
00:04:46,133 --> 00:04:47,691
- Us too.
- No.

71
00:04:47,868 --> 00:04:49,699
- Yeah.
- You have kids?

72
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:52,168
No. No. You guys?

73
00:04:52,339 --> 00:04:54,773
Yeah. We have a son.

74
00:04:55,008 --> 00:04:58,102
Was that a...?
Like a conscious decision?

75
00:04:58,812 --> 00:05:01,303
We... We tried actually, for years.

76
00:05:01,481 --> 00:05:05,577
But at this point, it looks like
it's not gonna work out.

77
00:05:05,752 --> 00:05:07,583
- Sorry.
- Yeah.

78
00:05:07,754 --> 00:05:10,279
It's actually been a huge strain
on our relationship.

79
00:05:10,457 --> 00:05:11,481
How so?

80
00:05:11,658 --> 00:05:15,424
You know, just not being able
to get pregnant and...

81
00:05:15,862 --> 00:05:17,420
You know.

82
00:05:20,801 --> 00:05:22,428
I'm sorry, this is weird.

83
00:05:22,602 --> 00:05:25,503
Maybe I... I mean,
maybe I'm being too intimate.

84
00:05:25,672 --> 00:05:29,699
No, no. It's okay. It's funny, I just feel...
I feel really comfortable with you, so...

85
00:05:29,876 --> 00:05:32,310
Me too. I'm glad.

86
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,074
Usually, when I become friends with
a guy, he thinks I'm hitting on him.

87
00:05:36,249 --> 00:05:38,183
Just because you care
about what you wear...

88
00:05:38,351 --> 00:05:40,649
...doesn't meant to say you're gay.
- Exactly.

89
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:45,490
I love your shirt, by the way.

90
00:05:48,128 --> 00:05:50,653
<i>Her hair alone</i>
<i>should have been a sign.</i>

91
00:05:51,498 --> 00:05:53,989
You think she just stopped bathing?

92
00:05:54,868 --> 00:05:58,167
No, just shampooing.

93
00:05:58,805 --> 00:06:02,673
Maybe she's upset
because her husband's gay.

94
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:06,675
God, why do you always say that?
He's not gay.

95
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:08,314
But what else could he be?

96
00:06:08,482 --> 00:06:10,279
Well, he's not. He's just Aaron.

97
00:06:11,718 --> 00:06:14,482
Hi. I can't believe
I had my phone off.

98
00:06:14,654 --> 00:06:16,849
I was at the movies
and forgot to turn it back on.

99
00:06:17,023 --> 00:06:18,456
- She's not out yet.
- Is she okay?

100
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:20,559
Yeah. Yeah.

101
00:06:21,962 --> 00:06:25,762
Well, you know,
she always did want a nose job.

102
00:06:25,932 --> 00:06:27,160
It's not funny.

103
00:06:27,334 --> 00:06:29,029
- Hi.
- How bad is her face?

104
00:06:29,202 --> 00:06:31,670
- My God.
- She broke her nose.

105
00:06:31,838 --> 00:06:33,135
Was she in a lot of pain?

106
00:06:33,306 --> 00:06:35,740
Actually, she couldn't stop laughing.

107
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:38,173
When she was conscious.

108
00:06:38,578 --> 00:06:41,012
What's even weirder
is that she hates Old Navy.

109
00:06:41,181 --> 00:06:43,376
- I mean...
- I love Old Navy.

110
00:06:44,951 --> 00:06:46,543
That's good.

111
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,085
So where were you?

112
00:06:48,255 --> 00:06:50,553
I was at the movies
with a friend of mine.

113
00:06:51,158 --> 00:06:54,594
- Which friend?
- New friend. This guy I met.

114
00:06:59,099 --> 00:07:03,695
So, Olivia, are you gonna
talk to me or what?

115
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,098
You know...

116
00:07:05,272 --> 00:07:07,740
Look, it was a really stupid idea.
Let's just forget it.

117
00:07:07,908 --> 00:07:11,309
No, I won't. I can't believe
you won't talk to me...

118
00:07:11,478 --> 00:07:13,241
...because I asked you
two questions.

119
00:07:13,413 --> 00:07:16,143
It wasn't just about two questions,
Franny. It was your tone.

120
00:07:16,316 --> 00:07:19,342
- What happened, huh?
- She...

121
00:07:21,021 --> 00:07:24,889
She wants to be a personal trainer.

122
00:07:29,362 --> 00:07:31,694
Oh, you know what?
Fuck all of you guys, all right?

123
00:07:31,865 --> 00:07:34,732
Look, I'm sorry I don't have
my entire life figured out.

124
00:07:34,901 --> 00:07:37,768
Olivia, we love you.

125
00:07:37,938 --> 00:07:39,200
We're the ones who love you.

126
00:07:40,407 --> 00:07:42,602
It's not like we have
all our lives figured out.

127
00:07:42,776 --> 00:07:44,937
Oh, that is such bullshit.

128
00:07:45,111 --> 00:07:47,102
You chose to quit your job.

129
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,645
That job was intolerable.

130
00:07:49,516 --> 00:07:50,915
That's still you.

131
00:07:51,084 --> 00:07:52,449
<i>Wheelchair to Admitting.</i>

132
00:07:53,086 --> 00:07:55,384
<i>Wheelchair to Admitting.</i>

133
00:07:55,555 --> 00:07:59,321
Well, I hope Jane will be okay
for the benefit thing.

134
00:07:59,492 --> 00:08:01,119
Shit. What am I gonna wear?

135
00:08:01,528 --> 00:08:03,257
- My God.
- I don't understand...

136
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:05,091
I don't understand
these fundraisers.

137
00:08:05,265 --> 00:08:09,531
I mean, they waste all this money
on the these parties.

138
00:08:09,803 --> 00:08:14,297
Why don't they just give the money
to the scientists or to the sick people?

139
00:08:14,474 --> 00:08:17,136
But you know what? They don't.

140
00:08:17,344 --> 00:08:19,812
They throw a party
so rich people like me...

141
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:22,540
...can spend $ 10,000 on a table...

142
00:08:22,782 --> 00:08:26,218
...and then they give it
to the sick people.

143
00:08:26,653 --> 00:08:29,281
Okay? That's how it's done.

144
00:09:04,691 --> 00:09:07,990
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hi. It's Olivia.

145
00:09:08,161 --> 00:09:09,594
You cannot call me here.

146
00:09:09,763 --> 00:09:14,962
Come on. You know. I really...
I really, really need to see you.

147
00:09:15,135 --> 00:09:17,035
<i>That's not possible.</i>

148
00:09:17,203 --> 00:09:20,229
Yeah, but don't you miss me at all?

149
00:09:21,107 --> 00:09:24,235
- <i>I have to hang up.</i>
- Come on. Just answer me.

150
00:09:24,411 --> 00:09:27,005
<i>I gotta go. I'll see you.</i>

151
00:09:34,621 --> 00:09:36,020
<i>Hello?</i>

152
00:09:38,358 --> 00:09:40,826
Hi. This is Olivia.

153
00:09:40,994 --> 00:09:42,825
<i>Olivia?</i>

154
00:09:43,463 --> 00:09:45,488
<i>My husband's one-night stand?</i>

155
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:47,230
Yeah.

156
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,891
I guess, if you consider two months
a one-night stand.

157
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:52,334
Could you please
put him on the phone?

158
00:09:52,505 --> 00:09:56,373
<i>Olivia, why don't you go find</i>
<i>a husband of your own.</i>

159
00:09:58,278 --> 00:10:02,908
I would if I fucking could, Edie!

160
00:10:04,217 --> 00:10:05,775
Fuck off!

161
00:10:05,952 --> 00:10:08,011
Hey, what about this one, honey?

162
00:10:08,221 --> 00:10:10,849
That one, Christine,
is scrawny and dead.

163
00:10:11,024 --> 00:10:12,889
I'm not spending
$ 100 on that.

164
00:10:13,059 --> 00:10:15,755
- They're all $ 100.
- It's disgusting.

165
00:10:15,929 --> 00:10:18,830
Why? You'd spend it on something
else, why not a Christmas tree?

166
00:10:18,999 --> 00:10:21,695
- Because we throw them away.
- That's crazy.

167
00:10:21,868 --> 00:10:25,429
No, $ 100 on a Christmas tree,
that's what's crazy.

168
00:10:26,272 --> 00:10:27,739
What's that?

169
00:10:27,907 --> 00:10:31,172
Nothing. I'm just trying to be
more like Franny. Not annoyed.

170
00:10:31,378 --> 00:10:35,041
Good. So let's not get one.

171
00:10:35,215 --> 00:10:36,341
Fine.

172
00:10:36,516 --> 00:10:38,711
But I want one.

173
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,548
- All right.
- Sorry, honey.

174
00:10:43,723 --> 00:10:46,590
- That one's more money.
- Fuck it.

175
00:10:48,094 --> 00:10:50,858
See, there are a lot of things
that are wrong and right.

176
00:10:51,031 --> 00:10:53,727
As you get older, you try to figure out
which ones are which.

177
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,265
And some are big and obvious...

178
00:10:55,435 --> 00:10:58,268
...like don't kill anybody
or hurt anybody on purpose.

179
00:10:58,438 --> 00:10:59,666
And some are trickier.

180
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:01,670
And sometimes you do
the wrong thing...

181
00:11:01,841 --> 00:11:04,105
...before you know
you're doing the wrong thing.

182
00:11:04,277 --> 00:11:05,744
Want some?
These are cute.

183
00:11:05,912 --> 00:11:07,573
Like what?

184
00:11:08,348 --> 00:11:10,043
Oh, I don't know.

185
00:11:10,483 --> 00:11:14,146
Okay, say you're taking a test,
and you don't know the answer.

186
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,949
So you look at the guy's paper sitting
next to you, and you copy his answer.

187
00:11:18,124 --> 00:11:20,888
- That's bad, right?
- Right. You should not do that.

188
00:11:21,061 --> 00:11:23,495
But while you're doing it,
you're thinking to yourself:

189
00:11:23,663 --> 00:11:26,496
"Well, this doesn't hurt anybody,
what difference does it make?"

190
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:30,033
Well, it does make a difference
because those little things add up.

191
00:11:30,203 --> 00:11:32,364
So, Wyatt,
what you should understand...

192
00:11:32,539 --> 00:11:35,337
There are a lot of injustices,
a lot of things aren't fair.

193
00:11:35,508 --> 00:11:37,999
When people make it worse
by doing the wrong things...

194
00:11:38,178 --> 00:11:40,112
...like taking your parking space...

195
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,544
...or cutting in front of you
in line at a store...

196
00:11:42,715 --> 00:11:45,343
...and then they're just
making the world an uglier place.

197
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:28,890
I figured out why Christine
always thinks Aaron is gay.

198
00:12:29,062 --> 00:12:32,293
Because she wants someone else to
have as bad a marriage as she does.

199
00:12:32,465 --> 00:12:36,367
And then she just gets mad
because she thinks Jane's in denial.

200
00:12:36,536 --> 00:12:39,232
You know,
I have no idea what you just said.

201
00:12:41,241 --> 00:12:42,640
Don't you think we have enough?

202
00:12:42,809 --> 00:12:44,299
A couple more.

203
00:12:44,477 --> 00:12:46,035
Well, they won't know
what hit them.

204
00:12:46,212 --> 00:12:48,271
Yeah, well, isn't that the point?

205
00:12:51,885 --> 00:12:53,614
Hey, lookit.

206
00:12:54,187 --> 00:12:56,553
- Lookit.
- Hey, stop... Don't go through her stuff.

207
00:12:56,723 --> 00:12:59,055
Well, she leaves it right here.

208
00:12:59,225 --> 00:13:01,853
Well, it's her house. Where else
is she supposed to put it?

209
00:13:02,028 --> 00:13:05,464
I don't know. Hidden somewhere.
Isn't she scared you're gonna find it?

210
00:13:05,632 --> 00:13:07,657
I didn't. You did.

211
00:13:07,834 --> 00:13:10,064
Did you clean those shelves?

212
00:13:10,236 --> 00:13:11,669
Yeah.

213
00:13:15,542 --> 00:13:17,942
I got you a Christmas present.

214
00:13:26,753 --> 00:13:28,687
Hey.

215
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:35,220
You... You missed a spot over there.

216
00:13:35,395 --> 00:13:36,953
Get it.

217
00:13:39,232 --> 00:13:40,824
Back here.

218
00:13:41,067 --> 00:13:43,035
Yeah, back here.

219
00:13:44,504 --> 00:13:47,439
Faster. Faster.

220
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:51,836
- Okay, turn it off.
- What?

221
00:13:52,011 --> 00:13:54,502
Put the vacuum down.
You're done with that now.

222
00:13:59,819 --> 00:14:02,811
Dust... Dust... Dust the trellis.

223
00:14:02,989 --> 00:14:07,426
And don't... Don't miss any spots.
It's delicate. It's very delicate.

224
00:14:07,594 --> 00:14:09,721
Yeah. Yeah.

225
00:14:09,896 --> 00:14:11,989
- Yes.
- Yes, what?

226
00:14:13,866 --> 00:14:15,163
Yes, Mr. Mike.

227
00:14:15,335 --> 00:14:17,462
Yeah. Get the lower bits.

228
00:14:18,972 --> 00:14:21,770
- Don't be sloppy. They're delicate...
- All right, you know what?

229
00:14:21,941 --> 00:14:23,966
I thought this maid's thing
was about sex.

230
00:14:25,378 --> 00:14:27,312
- It will be.
- When?

231
00:14:43,463 --> 00:14:44,725
I'll be right back.

232
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,741
Well, what the fuck did you think?

233
00:15:05,918 --> 00:15:09,285
That somehow we could all
just see through it?

234
00:15:11,824 --> 00:15:15,590
Excuse me. You guys have to stop,
okay? You have to stop working.

235
00:15:15,762 --> 00:15:18,230
Guys, you have to stop, okay?
You have...

236
00:15:18,398 --> 00:15:20,992
Everybody, the job's over, all right?
No more work. Please.

237
00:15:21,267 --> 00:15:23,667
Go home. You guys can go...
Does anybody speak English?

238
00:15:23,836 --> 00:15:26,634
Anyone? No work. You can
all go home. You understand?

239
00:15:26,806 --> 00:15:28,899
- No work?
- No work. Exactly. No work.

240
00:15:29,075 --> 00:15:32,511
- You can all go home, okay? <i>Adiós</i>.
- Go home?

241
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:35,113
Hey, hey.
Hey, what the hell are you doing?

242
00:15:35,281 --> 00:15:38,739
We have completely ruined our street.
Do you know what we've done?

243
00:15:38,918 --> 00:15:40,579
Guys, go back to work, please.

244
00:15:40,753 --> 00:15:44,382
- Yes.
- No. No, you have to stop. Please.

245
00:15:44,957 --> 00:15:47,949
No, David. Listen.
I just came from Marla's house.

246
00:15:48,127 --> 00:15:50,527
We've completely ruined her view
and everybody else's.

247
00:15:50,697 --> 00:15:53,723
Our house is so fucking huge
no one can see the sky anymore.

248
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,959
Are you serious?
You didn't know? Right.

249
00:15:56,135 --> 00:15:58,831
Know what? That we were doing
something really, really gross?

250
00:15:59,005 --> 00:16:00,700
- No, I didn't.
- What planet are you on?

251
00:16:00,873 --> 00:16:02,864
Everybody in the neighborhood
is doing this.

252
00:16:03,042 --> 00:16:06,443
Marla's trying to make you feel guilty.
You're the one that wanted the view.

253
00:16:06,612 --> 00:16:10,639
How the fuck else would you see
the ocean from the bedroom?

254
00:16:30,303 --> 00:16:32,669
<i>Hi, Christine.</i>
<i>This is Melanie Charney.</i>

255
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:34,363
<i>You know that maid</i>
<i>you recommended?</i>

256
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:37,805
<i>I'm sure this isn't the case, I wanted</i>
<i>to know how well you know her...</i>

257
00:16:37,977 --> 00:16:39,877
<i>... because, I don't know,</i>
<i>this is silly...</i>

258
00:16:40,046 --> 00:16:42,606
<i>... but I'm missing</i>
<i>a $75 jar of face cream.</i>

259
00:16:42,782 --> 00:16:44,579
<i>And I just can't imagine</i>
<i>where it went.</i>

260
00:16:45,118 --> 00:16:47,916
<i>I mean, what kind of person</i>
<i>would steal someone's face cream?</i>

261
00:16:48,087 --> 00:16:50,282
<i>Will you give me a call</i>
<i>when you can?</i>

262
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:54,526
We're more than halfway through.
We're not stopping now.

263
00:16:54,694 --> 00:16:56,628
- You don't care about others.
- You knew.

264
00:16:57,096 --> 00:16:58,961
You just didn't want
to pay attention.

265
00:16:59,132 --> 00:17:02,101
- I didn't know!
- You notice what you want.

266
00:17:02,835 --> 00:17:04,928
Shit!

267
00:17:06,239 --> 00:17:07,797
I'm going out for a while.

268
00:17:08,908 --> 00:17:10,637
"You all right?
Did you burn yourself?"

269
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:12,334
What are you talking about?

270
00:17:12,512 --> 00:17:15,140
Nothing. I just burned
the fuck out of my hand...

271
00:17:15,314 --> 00:17:17,714
...and I politely asked myself
if I was all right.

272
00:17:17,884 --> 00:17:20,045
It's something you seem
to be incapable of doing.

273
00:17:20,553 --> 00:17:23,113
- What?
- I just burned my hand.

274
00:17:23,289 --> 00:17:26,452
- Did you notice?
- I don't... I don't know. Yes, I guess so.

275
00:17:26,626 --> 00:17:29,026
Does it ever occur to you to say,
"Are you all right?"

276
00:17:29,195 --> 00:17:32,892
- You are all right.
- But does it ever occur to you to ask?

277
00:17:33,065 --> 00:17:35,056
If you're all right,
which you clearly are...

278
00:17:35,234 --> 00:17:37,395
...then what the fuck
is the difference?

279
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:40,368
If you want me to know you're all right,
why don't you tell me?

280
00:17:44,477 --> 00:17:48,140
Okay. So say I scrape
the fuck out of my arm.

281
00:17:48,314 --> 00:17:50,805
And I yell:

282
00:17:54,153 --> 00:17:55,882
And you don't say anything.

283
00:17:56,055 --> 00:17:59,252
I should say,
"Don't worry, honey, I'm all right."

284
00:17:59,425 --> 00:18:02,121
Yes. What's wrong with that?

285
00:18:18,411 --> 00:18:22,404
So I'll speak to you soon.
I had a good time.

286
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:26,245
I thought we were gonna go
to dinner or something.

287
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,778
I can't. I can't. I wish I could.

288
00:18:29,088 --> 00:18:33,047
I already have a plan for dinner.
I'm sorry.

289
00:18:36,262 --> 00:18:38,287
Thanks for my present.

290
00:18:39,465 --> 00:18:42,764
We... We almost forgot.

291
00:18:44,837 --> 00:18:46,304
My cut.

292
00:18:50,977 --> 00:18:53,104
You really want this money?

293
00:18:53,646 --> 00:18:55,477
I helped.

294
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:59,350
You're a fuck.

295
00:20:15,628 --> 00:20:18,688
You just will. People do.

296
00:20:19,932 --> 00:20:23,368
But how? I can't even imagine.

297
00:20:23,903 --> 00:20:26,235
Does one of us move out?

298
00:20:27,173 --> 00:20:29,573
- Him or me?
- Him.

299
00:20:37,016 --> 00:20:40,577
I can't believe I'm talking about this.

300
00:20:46,659 --> 00:20:49,059
I'm sorry, Aaron,
you can have your wife back.

301
00:20:49,228 --> 00:20:51,856
I just... I should go anyway.

302
00:20:57,937 --> 00:21:00,269
Just take your time.

303
00:21:13,052 --> 00:21:15,350
Hi, my name is Olivia...

304
00:21:15,521 --> 00:21:19,355
...and I am the lady
that cleans your house.

305
00:21:19,525 --> 00:21:20,753
And I'm calling to say...

306
00:21:20,926 --> 00:21:24,054
...that I'm not going to be able
to come to work anymore.

307
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:26,289
Actually, I got another job.

308
00:21:26,465 --> 00:21:28,592
I'm... So I'm very sorry.

309
00:21:39,912 --> 00:21:42,073
<i>Hey, it's Marty.</i>
<i>Leave a message after the beep.</i>

310
00:21:42,248 --> 00:21:43,476
<i>All right.</i>

311
00:21:43,649 --> 00:21:46,482
Hi, this is Olivia.
I'm the lady that cleans your house...

312
00:21:46,652 --> 00:21:49,314
...and I'm calling to say
that I'm not gonna be able to...

313
00:21:49,488 --> 00:21:50,978
<i>Hey.</i>

314
00:21:51,557 --> 00:21:53,991
Oh, hi. You're there.

315
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,321
- Yeah.
- <i>I'm calling to tell you...</i>

316
00:21:56,495 --> 00:22:00,989
<i>... that I'm not gonna be able</i>
<i>to do it anymore.</i>

317
00:22:01,167 --> 00:22:02,464
Well, how come?

318
00:22:03,369 --> 00:22:05,496
Be... Well...

319
00:22:05,671 --> 00:22:07,571
Because I just...

320
00:22:08,174 --> 00:22:10,972
- Well, actually, I got a job.
- What is it?

321
00:22:12,978 --> 00:22:14,741
In cosmetics.

322
00:22:17,917 --> 00:22:19,316
Yeah.

323
00:22:23,856 --> 00:22:25,414
Hey, what do you do?

324
00:22:27,026 --> 00:22:31,861
I am presently not employed
at the moment.

325
00:22:32,031 --> 00:22:33,464
Well, what did you do?

326
00:22:33,632 --> 00:22:36,328
<i>A little bit of everything.</i>
<i>A lot of nothing.</i>

327
00:22:44,577 --> 00:22:46,340
Do you wanna go out sometime?

328
00:22:50,282 --> 00:22:51,510
Sure.

329
00:22:52,518 --> 00:22:53,917
Good.

330
00:23:00,726 --> 00:23:03,490
- Pretty good, huh?
- That's very nice.

331
00:23:06,665 --> 00:23:08,098
- Very pretty.
- God.

332
00:23:08,267 --> 00:23:10,326
Is this too dressy
for homeless people?

333
00:23:10,503 --> 00:23:12,061
ALS, ALS.

334
00:23:12,238 --> 00:23:14,604
Why do I keep forgetting that?

335
00:23:15,708 --> 00:23:18,506
Oh, wow, this is soft.

336
00:23:18,677 --> 00:23:20,611
When did you start working
with this fabric?

337
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:22,714
- It gets little holes in it, though.
- Really?

338
00:23:23,082 --> 00:23:25,141
I'm kind of afraid to move.

339
00:23:25,317 --> 00:23:27,285
It looks cuter
when it gets little holes.

340
00:23:27,453 --> 00:23:30,251
Jesus, not when you're paying
800 bucks for it.

341
00:23:30,422 --> 00:23:31,787
Well, you're not paying for it.

342
00:23:31,957 --> 00:23:33,891
- I didn't mean anything by that.
- It's okay.

343
00:23:34,059 --> 00:23:36,118
I know it's overpriced,
but it has to be.

344
00:23:36,295 --> 00:23:38,263
- I'm paying for mine.
- Shut up.

345
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:39,692
- I will.
- Just shut up.

346
00:23:39,865 --> 00:23:43,062
- Why shouldn't I?
- Because it's a gift.

347
00:23:43,969 --> 00:23:46,369
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

348
00:23:46,539 --> 00:23:48,097
- All right.
- Thank you.

349
00:23:55,748 --> 00:23:57,409
I don't know about that.

350
00:23:57,716 --> 00:23:58,740
- I know.
- This?

351
00:23:58,918 --> 00:24:00,249
Take it off.

352
00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:01,784
Take it off, take it off.

353
00:24:01,954 --> 00:24:04,252
Oh, thank you so much.
I... It's just a little runny.

354
00:24:04,423 --> 00:24:05,788
Oh, sorry. I'll make it again.

355
00:24:05,958 --> 00:24:08,893
You should not apologize.
He should be apologizing.

356
00:24:09,061 --> 00:24:11,086
You should've order them
over-medium, honey.

357
00:24:11,263 --> 00:24:13,288
No, then they come back dry.

358
00:24:13,465 --> 00:24:15,592
Always. Especially here.

359
00:24:15,768 --> 00:24:17,429
Oh, we've never been here actually.

360
00:24:17,603 --> 00:24:19,264
- Who picked it?
- I did.

361
00:24:19,438 --> 00:24:21,201
I really like it, I really like it.

362
00:24:21,373 --> 00:24:23,307
- So do I. There's such...
- What do you do?

363
00:24:23,475 --> 00:24:25,670
- Oh, we run the company together.
- Yeah, yeah.

364
00:24:25,845 --> 00:24:28,336
Aaron's the artist,
and I'm pretty much the bookkeeper.

365
00:24:28,514 --> 00:24:31,142
- No.
- I always give socks as presents.

366
00:24:31,317 --> 00:24:32,545
- Really?
- I have for years.

367
00:24:32,718 --> 00:24:35,983
So did we, but you can only give
your wares away for so long...

368
00:24:36,155 --> 00:24:38,419
...and then you actually
have to buy something.

369
00:24:38,924 --> 00:24:41,085
Didn't I ask for coffee an hour ago?
Excuse me.

370
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:44,457
Could I have some more co...?
Fell off the face of the fucking earth.

371
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:48,066
What do you have to do...? They have
one job and they can't do that right.

372
00:24:48,234 --> 00:24:50,259
- Jane. Please.
- What? What?

373
00:24:50,436 --> 00:24:51,994
Will you not have one of your fits.

374
00:24:52,171 --> 00:24:55,834
I mean, we're having
a really lovely time. Okay?

375
00:25:01,647 --> 00:25:03,171
He's gay.

376
00:25:03,349 --> 00:25:05,544
He's not gay.

377
00:25:05,718 --> 00:25:07,185
- Oh, okay.
- You just met his wife.

378
00:25:07,353 --> 00:25:08,980
Who has a serious bug up her ass...

379
00:25:09,154 --> 00:25:11,315
...and has a reason.
- She does.

380
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:13,082
What does she have
to complain about?

381
00:25:13,259 --> 00:25:16,285
Do you know how much her clothes
cost? They're hideously overpriced.

382
00:25:16,462 --> 00:25:19,090
- Sweetheart, you buy them.
- Oh, they're gorgeous.

383
00:25:19,265 --> 00:25:21,096
Who cares if you don't get
another coffee?

384
00:25:21,267 --> 00:25:23,428
Was it worth making us look
like crazy people...

385
00:25:23,602 --> 00:25:26,093
...in front of our new friends?

386
00:25:26,372 --> 00:25:28,033
Just tell me.

387
00:25:29,141 --> 00:25:33,441
What horrible injustice was done
to you that you have to act this way?

388
00:25:33,612 --> 00:25:35,079
What is it that you don't have...

389
00:25:35,247 --> 00:25:39,206
...that you have to walk straight
into a plate-glass window?

390
00:25:39,585 --> 00:25:42,611
Or that you can't get up the incentive
to wash your fucking hair.

391
00:25:42,788 --> 00:25:45,348
- I wash my hair.
- Yeah, when?

392
00:25:45,791 --> 00:25:47,588
Have you seen it recently?

393
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,025
Just tell me, are you intending
to go to the benefit looking like that?

394
00:25:51,196 --> 00:25:54,222
What's the point? It gets dirty
and you have to wash it all again.

395
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,494
That's what civilized people do.
They get up and they wash their hair.

396
00:25:57,670 --> 00:25:59,729
And when it gets dirty,
they wash it again.

397
00:25:59,905 --> 00:26:03,898
- Well, I don't want to.
- Jesus. Is this your idea of rebelling...

398
00:26:04,076 --> 00:26:06,340
...against the way things are?
- I'm not rebelling.

399
00:26:06,512 --> 00:26:09,106
- What are you doing?
- I'm just tired.

400
00:26:10,883 --> 00:26:12,578
Of what?

401
00:26:14,019 --> 00:26:18,422
I just guess I feel like there's no more
wondering what it's gonna be like.

402
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:21,081
Like what's gonna be like?

403
00:26:22,928 --> 00:26:25,522
My fabulous life.

404
00:26:30,169 --> 00:26:32,501
You don't like your life?

405
00:26:35,574 --> 00:26:38,008
No, I do. I like my life.

406
00:26:40,746 --> 00:26:42,077
Good.

407
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:46,481
I hate black tie.

408
00:26:46,852 --> 00:26:50,049
You know,
Olivia's bringing some guy again.

409
00:26:50,856 --> 00:26:52,653
We're buying some guy
a $ 1000 dinner?

410
00:26:52,825 --> 00:26:54,725
I know. At first,
I was kind of annoyed.

411
00:26:54,893 --> 00:26:58,260
But then I just feel so bad
that I introduced her to Mike.

412
00:26:58,430 --> 00:26:59,692
I mean...

413
00:26:59,865 --> 00:27:02,857
I had no idea he'd be such a dick.

414
00:27:03,035 --> 00:27:05,026
And then she knew
David wasn't coming...

415
00:27:05,204 --> 00:27:07,434
...and there's an extra seat,
so you know.

416
00:27:07,706 --> 00:27:09,264
Still have to talk to him.

417
00:27:09,441 --> 00:27:11,875
<i>Well, just sit</i>
<i>at the other side of the table.</i>

418
00:27:12,044 --> 00:27:14,069
<i>It's for a good cause.</i>

419
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:17,043
<i>What? ALS or Olivia?</i>

420
00:27:19,752 --> 00:27:21,743
Wow, you look amazing.

421
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,854
Thank you.

422
00:27:24,523 --> 00:27:27,185
<i>Maybe this guy will be the right one.</i>

423
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:28,553
<i>It only takes one.</i>

424
00:27:29,995 --> 00:27:31,257
Do I have a smudge?

425
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:32,692
No.

426
00:27:32,865 --> 00:27:35,834
It's just, I think
you might be a little casual.

427
00:27:36,001 --> 00:27:37,263
Do you have a tie?

428
00:27:37,436 --> 00:27:38,903
I... Oh...

429
00:27:42,708 --> 00:27:44,141
<i>So, what's he like?</i>

430
00:27:44,376 --> 00:27:46,367
<i>He sounded kind of nice.</i>

431
00:27:46,545 --> 00:27:49,776
<i>More like her</i>
<i>than her other boyfriends.</i>

432
00:27:49,948 --> 00:27:52,849
Isn't it weird how they throw
these fancy parties for money?

433
00:27:53,018 --> 00:27:55,714
Why don't they give the money
to the sick people directly?

434
00:27:55,888 --> 00:27:59,016
It seems like such a waste, right?

435
00:27:59,191 --> 00:28:00,818
Anyway...

436
00:28:02,694 --> 00:28:06,425
You know, I don't think
the two of you have much in common.

437
00:28:07,199 --> 00:28:10,396
I know. I sometimes wonder
if we met now...

438
00:28:10,569 --> 00:28:12,264
...if we'd be friends.

439
00:28:12,438 --> 00:28:14,406
Not likely.

440
00:28:15,507 --> 00:28:17,202
Probably not.

441
00:28:21,246 --> 00:28:22,873
That's good.

442
00:28:23,048 --> 00:28:24,982
- That's so true.
- Yeah.

443
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:27,311
That is so true.

444
00:28:27,886 --> 00:28:29,581
You're funny.

445
00:28:29,755 --> 00:28:31,017
- <i>Max?</i>
- <i>Yes?</i>

446
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:32,817
<i>Do you like these shoes?</i>

447
00:28:34,193 --> 00:28:35,455
Or are they too clunky?

448
00:28:35,627 --> 00:28:39,188
- What's "clunky" mean?
- It means, you know, heavy.

449
00:28:39,364 --> 00:28:41,855
Not delicate. Like chunky.

450
00:28:47,439 --> 00:28:50,203
You're not gonna give me
any help, are you?

451
00:28:50,709 --> 00:28:52,404
Good boy.

452
00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:57,043
When we met, I had like
400 different kinds, remember?

453
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:58,706
Yeah, I do.

454
00:28:58,884 --> 00:29:01,444
I was obsessed with shampoo.

455
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:03,850
I thought if I could find
the right one...

456
00:29:04,022 --> 00:29:06,582
...my hair would be
the hair I always wanted.

457
00:29:06,859 --> 00:29:09,123
Like, every time I washed
it was a new opportunity.

458
00:29:09,294 --> 00:29:12,354
A new chance to be pretty.

459
00:29:12,931 --> 00:29:15,058
Just right.

460
00:29:17,169 --> 00:29:18,397
Then I married you...

461
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:21,004
...and I found out they all have
the same shit in them.

462
00:29:28,614 --> 00:29:29,876
<i>You guys...</i>

463
00:29:30,048 --> 00:29:31,447
<i>... I love this stuff.</i>

464
00:29:31,617 --> 00:29:33,482
This is amazing.

465
00:29:33,652 --> 00:29:36,917
Lookit, this is expensive stuff.

466
00:29:37,389 --> 00:29:39,949
Oh, my God,
would you smell that candle.

467
00:29:40,993 --> 00:29:42,017
- Vomit.
- What?

468
00:29:42,194 --> 00:29:43,752
- Here.
- Oh, please. You serious?

469
00:29:43,929 --> 00:29:45,829
- Yeah.
- You know what?

470
00:29:45,998 --> 00:29:47,522
Give her the whole thing.

471
00:29:47,966 --> 00:29:50,298
Thank you. Oh, my God.

472
00:29:50,469 --> 00:29:52,403
Listen, I'm keeping mine.

473
00:29:53,605 --> 00:29:55,630
It's what you put in this bag anyway.

474
00:29:55,807 --> 00:29:59,607
If you want to, you could
just donate that directly to ALS.

475
00:29:59,778 --> 00:30:00,972
Oh, fuck you.

476
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:06,811
- How is Max?
- He's okay.

477
00:30:06,985 --> 00:30:09,283
He's gonna go to a shrink.
I think it'll help him.

478
00:30:09,454 --> 00:30:11,581
- Yeah, that's good.
- In case you're wondering...

479
00:30:11,757 --> 00:30:15,090
...my husband and I just split.
- I know, Olivia told me everything.

480
00:30:17,396 --> 00:30:19,296
Sorry. I'm divorced too.

481
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:22,323
It's really hard at first.

482
00:30:22,501 --> 00:30:23,934
Marty has a daughter.

483
00:30:24,102 --> 00:30:26,832
And I actually saw a picture of her.
She's so cute.

484
00:30:27,005 --> 00:30:28,734
- She's 10. She's beautiful.
- Really?

485
00:30:28,907 --> 00:30:30,568
- What's her name?
- Ivy.

486
00:30:30,742 --> 00:30:32,767
Ivy. I love that name.

487
00:30:33,412 --> 00:30:36,677
So, Marty, what do you...?
What do you do?

488
00:30:36,848 --> 00:30:38,145
I mean, for a living?

489
00:30:39,284 --> 00:30:42,048
I dabble in some stuff...

490
00:30:42,221 --> 00:30:43,620
...and...

491
00:30:43,789 --> 00:30:46,314
...opportunities, investments.

492
00:30:46,491 --> 00:30:48,925
I get stuff done.

493
00:30:51,964 --> 00:30:56,094
- There's so much stuff in this auction.
- Yeah, there are.

494
00:30:56,268 --> 00:30:58,327
Reese Witherspoon
will knit me a sweater.

495
00:30:58,704 --> 00:31:00,467
- Sweetheart, look at this.
- So weird.

496
00:31:00,639 --> 00:31:02,664
Tandem bike.
We could get that and ride that.

497
00:31:02,841 --> 00:31:04,206
How long would that take?

498
00:31:04,376 --> 00:31:06,606
Does anyone know
what a Donzi boat is?

499
00:31:06,778 --> 00:31:08,177
- I don't.
- Oh, my God.

500
00:31:08,347 --> 00:31:11,111
Who would pay to walk on
<i>Nip/Tuck</i>?

501
00:31:11,283 --> 00:31:13,183
Oh, God, I would.

502
00:31:13,352 --> 00:31:14,944
I'd be there in a shot.

503
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,712
That surprises me.

504
00:31:17,489 --> 00:31:19,081
Why?

505
00:31:20,125 --> 00:31:22,389
Is this pretty fucking small
for 1000 bucks.

506
00:31:22,561 --> 00:31:25,325
Jane, please.

507
00:31:25,697 --> 00:31:28,530
Before we start eating
our really small food...

508
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,997
...I wanna make a toast...

509
00:31:30,168 --> 00:31:33,604
...to the fact that, you know,
we don't have ALS...

510
00:31:33,772 --> 00:31:36,172
...or anything horrible.

511
00:31:37,909 --> 00:31:40,002
- Yet.
- Jesus, Matt.

512
00:31:40,178 --> 00:31:41,406
No, no, no, it's true.

513
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,309
This is when starts. This is the age.

514
00:31:43,482 --> 00:31:46,542
No shit, man. I just found out
I have 15 percent bone loss.

515
00:31:46,718 --> 00:31:48,208
- Which bone?
- What is bone loss?

516
00:31:48,387 --> 00:31:49,684
It's absolutely normal.

517
00:31:49,855 --> 00:31:52,221
It's like kind of before osteoporosis
sets in.

518
00:31:52,391 --> 00:31:57,021
Welcome and thank you all for being
part of this very important evening.

519
00:31:57,195 --> 00:32:01,564
Project ALS is driving
scientific research forward.

520
00:32:01,733 --> 00:32:06,500
And tonight, we are paying tribute
to the individuals...

521
00:32:19,084 --> 00:32:21,518
You were the prettiest one there.

522
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:29,452
<i>He was actually really nice.</i>

523
00:32:29,628 --> 00:32:31,220
And did you see his jacket?
It was...

524
00:32:31,396 --> 00:32:33,387
It was really quite beautiful.

525
00:32:33,565 --> 00:32:35,328
- Whose?
- Olivia's boyfriend.

526
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,434
The fabric, it was quite gorgeous.

527
00:32:37,602 --> 00:32:38,830
Oh, I don't think so.

528
00:32:39,004 --> 00:32:40,471
And I know fabric.

529
00:32:40,639 --> 00:32:42,436
No, no. I felt it on the way out.

530
00:32:42,607 --> 00:32:45,974
It was cashmere.

531
00:32:46,845 --> 00:32:48,073
Pretty expensive.

532
00:32:48,246 --> 00:32:50,146
He does seem nice, you know?

533
00:32:50,315 --> 00:32:53,443
And she looked sort of happy.

534
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:58,380
And the girls just looked great
in your clothes.

535
00:33:03,395 --> 00:33:05,989
You were the prettiest one there.

536
00:33:21,346 --> 00:33:22,574
- Hi.
- Hi.

537
00:33:22,748 --> 00:33:24,010
Did he go to sleep okay?

538
00:33:24,182 --> 00:33:26,309
- Yeah, it was fine.
- Good.

539
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,351
Thanks. Good night.

540
00:33:30,522 --> 00:33:32,251
Good night.

541
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:37,991
I know they're a really depressed
group of people.

542
00:33:38,163 --> 00:33:41,997
No. That's probably why I was
so comfortable around them.

543
00:33:42,167 --> 00:33:43,464
Really? You liked them?

544
00:33:43,635 --> 00:33:45,193
Yeah.

545
00:33:46,338 --> 00:33:47,327
I'm sorry about Matt.

546
00:33:47,506 --> 00:33:51,909
God, he asked all those questions
about, you know, your work.

547
00:33:59,684 --> 00:34:03,848
I don't usually tell people this...

548
00:34:04,423 --> 00:34:07,187
...unless I've known them
for a long time...

549
00:34:08,326 --> 00:34:09,918
...but I don't work.

550
00:34:10,095 --> 00:34:12,757
Yeah. I don't blame you.

551
00:34:12,931 --> 00:34:16,423
I mean, if I could figure out a way
not to do it, I wouldn't either.

552
00:34:16,601 --> 00:34:18,501
I mean, right?

553
00:34:19,171 --> 00:34:20,934
No, I mean...

554
00:34:21,106 --> 00:34:25,133
...l'm really rich.

555
00:34:29,648 --> 00:34:31,206
Yeah, you wish.

556
00:34:31,383 --> 00:34:32,748
No, I mean it.

557
00:34:32,918 --> 00:34:36,376
My family, my father actually...

558
00:34:36,655 --> 00:34:41,149
...was incredibly wealthy,
and I inherited all his money.

559
00:34:43,128 --> 00:34:46,120
I don't need to work.

560
00:34:46,832 --> 00:34:48,663
So I don't.

561
00:34:52,471 --> 00:34:55,963
Well, that's... I mean, that's great.

562
00:34:56,208 --> 00:34:58,073
Good for you.

563
00:35:10,555 --> 00:35:12,682
I just can't take the in-laws
anymore, Richard.

564
00:35:12,858 --> 00:35:14,985
They're wearing down my nerves.

565
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,287
Well, what do you think
it's like for me?

566
00:35:17,462 --> 00:35:20,693
Your sister
with those spaghetti dishes.

567
00:35:20,866 --> 00:35:22,993
I thought you liked
the way my sister cooked.

568
00:35:23,168 --> 00:35:24,658
She...

569
00:35:39,851 --> 00:35:43,048
You okay, Miss Christine?

570
00:36:01,873 --> 00:36:05,969
So I was thinking, like,
a nice armoire over there.

571
00:36:06,144 --> 00:36:07,577
- Oh, yeah.
- You know?

572
00:36:07,746 --> 00:36:09,373
I like those.

573
00:36:09,548 --> 00:36:11,675
And maybe some new curtains.

574
00:36:13,518 --> 00:36:15,713
I always...
I always wanted to get this...

575
00:36:15,887 --> 00:36:18,788
...but I just don't know where to go.
- Oh, I know where to go.

576
00:36:18,957 --> 00:36:20,185
- Really?
- Yeah.

577
00:36:20,358 --> 00:36:22,292
- So you'll help me?
- Oh, yeah.

578
00:36:22,794 --> 00:36:25,661
- That would be great.
- Yeah. No, there's...

579
00:36:33,838 --> 00:36:36,830
Hey, can I...?
Can I ask you something?

580
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,071
You know,
remember when we first met?

581
00:36:44,249 --> 00:36:47,707
And you bargained down my price?

582
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,312
Yeah?

583
00:36:50,655 --> 00:36:52,646
Why would you do that?

584
00:36:53,191 --> 00:36:55,386
I mean, when you have
a lot of money.

585
00:36:57,462 --> 00:36:58,952
I'm sorry.

586
00:37:00,398 --> 00:37:01,888
That's...

587
00:37:02,067 --> 00:37:04,058
I just...

588
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:09,732
I... I guess I have some issues.

589
00:37:11,076 --> 00:37:12,338
You do?

590
00:37:14,379 --> 00:37:20,011
I... You know,
people sort of problems.

591
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:22,916
I have them.

592
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,625
That's okay.

593
00:37:40,705 --> 00:37:42,764
I got problems.

594
00:37:43,764 --> 00:37:53,764
