1
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:54,900
Doc.

2
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:57,407
Those pills you
gave me for my back?

3
00:02:57,544 --> 00:02:59,409
I'm not sure that they work.

4
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:02,606
I'm not sure either,
but you don't hear me complain.

5
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:06,082
Stop by the office
at the end of the afternoon.

6
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:07,481
Thanks, Doc.

7
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:10,286
They're kidding, right?

8
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:12,983
No, they're not kidding.
This is your movie.

9
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:15,094
This is small-town America.

10
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:17,992
Town in New Hampshire was
small-town America too.

11
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:21,100
$40,000 a day to shoot on the street.
Then they kick us out.

12
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:24,897
That's life in the movie business.
But look here

13
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:28,007
A jacket for five dollars.
I could buy this whole town for 50 bucks.

14
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:30,905
- You said that about the last town.
- They never shot a movie here.

15
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,103
I'm bleeding, Bill.
I'm bleeding.

16
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:36,511
- Why am I here?
- What can pass for the old mill?

17
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:38,276
There you go.

18
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:42,286
'The Waterford Mill, built 1825.
Long a tourist attraction.'

19
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,088
Wake up Uberto.

20
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:49,992
- We're here.
- Where are we?

21
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:51,289
Give him a cigarette.

22
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:53,296
They sended the old mill
from New Hampshire?

23
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:55,094
They're holding it for ransom.

24
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,702
- We build one?
- They got one.

25
00:03:56,836 --> 00:03:58,497
We build a firehut?

26
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,802
Okay. But we have to
lose the window.

27
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:05,604
We can't lose the window.

28
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,804
Then I can't do this shot, Wally.

29
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:10,381
You wants me to push in
through the window.

30
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:13,883
Look! I can't push in
through the window.

31
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,681
- We go back to New Hampshire?
- No.

32
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:16,982
We can't ever go back
to New Hampshire.

33
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:19,785
No.
We're going to stay here.

34
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,484
This is what my people died for

35
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:23,892
The right to make
a movie in this town.

36
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:26,098
That traffic light.

37
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:28,393
What was wrong
with the old traffic light?

38
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:29,899
I'm glad you asked.

39
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:33,494
I'll tell you what was wrong with it.
It was behind the times.

40
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,902
- Morning, darling.
- Morning.

41
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,305
You want to bring business
to this town?

42
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:42,107
You have to plan for a Waterford
that does not exist at this moment.

43
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:45,684
You have to live in the present, folks.
You cannot live in the past.

44
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:47,376
Good morning.

45
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,579
- Hi, Annie.
- Hi, Carla.

46
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:52,589
Annie, I'll be a little late
for the rehearsal tonight.

47
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:54,488
Okay, Maude.
Do you know your lines?

48
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:57,494
I know them. I don't know
what order they come in.

49
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,291
We'll work it out.

50
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:02,697
What shall we have that's
good to eat? Something yummy.

51
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:04,894
- What're they on about?
- Traffic light.

52
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:08,303
Jack's right.
Public office is a public trust.

53
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:10,102
This is why this is America.

54
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:12,905
Right. Question is,
who owns the street?

55
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:14,809
That is the question.

56
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:33,797
Lots of room.

57
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:42,697
Marty, we got a new town.
Yeah. It's...

58
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,810
- Where are we again?
- Waterford, Vermont.

59
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:48,107
Waterford, Vermont.
It's...

60
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:51,478
Where is it?
That's where it is.

61
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:53,676
Here, Talk to Bill.

62
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,378
You got to get me
Main St. For nothing.

63
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,079
I will.

64
00:05:57,223 --> 00:06:02,593
Marty. Bill.
Okay, put her on.

65
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:05,789
Kathy.
Stand by.

66
00:06:09,235 --> 00:06:12,898
Everyone goes to
Waterford, Vermont.

67
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:18,003
Well, look on a bigger map.

68
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:20,612
- God, she makes me cranky.
- May I help you?

69
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,572
Yeah. I'd like to
speak to the manager.

70
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:25,775
Would you like a room?

71
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:28,682
No. We want to rent
the whole hotel.

72
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:34,986
Because. Because.

73
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:38,495
Because we don't have to build
an old mill. They have one.

74
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:41,896
Yeah, It's on a stream.
That's where you put an old mill.

75
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:43,592
They run on water.

76
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:46,899
Okay, I'm looking at...
I've got scene twelve.

77
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,301
Come in.

78
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:50,400
Thank you.

79
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:54,111
- Shouldn't you be in school?
- It's night.

80
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:58,576
Scene twelve:
The arrival at the mill.

81
00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:00,276
Alright, Work it out
and get back to me.

82
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,184
- Mr. Price?
- What?

83
00:07:03,322 --> 00:07:05,290
What is it?
We're working.

84
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:09,888
'Bring it in on time,
there'll be more of these. Marty.

85
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:12,998
P.S. I want to talk to you
about a product tie-in.'

86
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:15,191
Somebody make a note.
I want li...

87
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:17,097
- What does the broad like?
- Lilacs.

88
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:20,501
Ok, A truckload of lilacs
when the broad comes.

89
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:24,098
And get something for
Bob Barrenger. What does he like?

90
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:26,803
- Bob Barrenger's in this movie?
- That's correct.

91
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,311
He's staying here?
Bob barrenger's...

92
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:31,281
- What does he like?
- Fourteen-year-old girls.

93
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:35,183
Well, get him something else.
Let's get out of here in one piece.

94
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:37,983
Get him half a
28-year-old girl.

95
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,785
How's my math?

96
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:43,091
Who wanted these story boards?

97
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:47,798
Sound department said
there's no hold up on the KMR81.

98
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:50,698
Two of the caterers are
down with botulism.

99
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:52,896
And Uberto says
he can't take this shot

100
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,098
without taking out
the firehouse window.

101
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:56,299
I need my lucky pillow.

102
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:58,603
Walt, we must talk
about her nude scene.

103
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:00,405
I need that permit
to shoot on Main St.

104
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:01,604
I need to speak
to the Mayor.

105
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:03,374
- Speak to him.
- We can't find him.

106
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:05,882
- Aren't you ever in school?
- There's other things to be learned.

107
00:08:06,018 --> 00:08:08,782
- Is that true? Like what?
- Like the Mayor's here.

108
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:10,582
- What's his name?
- Mr. Bailey.

109
00:08:10,723 --> 00:08:13,191
- Hi, Mr. Bailey.
- You got to do these again.

110
00:08:14,026 --> 00:08:14,788
Okay

111
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:17,896
Mr. Bailey. Mr. Bailey.

112
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,793
Walt Price.
I'm going to be your director.

113
00:08:19,932 --> 00:08:20,899
I lost my typewriter.

114
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:24,594
I have to tell you,
I cannot express to you how happy...

115
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:26,796
- We're glad to have you here.
- Well...

116
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:28,998
No phone calls,
I'm with the Mayor.

117
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:31,908
Yes, can I speak
to my wife, please?

118
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:33,807
This isn't our firehouse.

119
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:35,914
No, it's a firehouse
in New Hampshire.

120
00:08:36,048 --> 00:08:37,481
Why did you leave
New Hampshire?

121
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:39,084
Would you like a cigar?

122
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:42,287
- Aren't these illegal?
- Why would they be?

123
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:45,481
Well, the trade embargo
against Cuba.

124
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,786
Nobody tells me anything.

125
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:50,691
Well, you know, Walt...

126
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:54,095
I'd like to say that
anything I could do...

127
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:56,701
That's very kind of you.
As a matter of fact, one...

128
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:58,599
- I hate to bother you...
- Not at all.

129
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:00,706
We need a shooting permit
for Main St.

130
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,398
Whatever you need.

131
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,705
- The city council will have to pass...
- The city council.

132
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:09,713
Yeah, pass on your permit.
But that's less than a formality.

133
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:12,784
- It is?
- Yeah. I am the city council.

134
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:15,478
Well, Mr. Mayor,
that's very kind of you.

135
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:20,786
My wife would like to invite you
to have dinner with us, at our home.

136
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:23,293
I'd like to welcome you.
And I hate to be a pain...

137
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:26,887
Oh, I would be delighted.
Are you kidding me?

138
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:29,592
I won't take more
of your time...

139
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:32,795
- Not at all.
- I can't imagine the responsibility.

140
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:35,499
Actually, I can, because...

141
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:38,906
once I had to video
my grandniece's confirmation.

142
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:41,513
Walt, it's Marty on the coast.

143
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:45,879
- We'll see you Tuesday for dinner.
- It's a great pleasure meeting you.

144
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:48,885
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Bye- bye.

145
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,584
I found your lucky pillow.

146
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,588
It's Marty on the coast.

147
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:59,391
Of course he's on the coast.
Where's he going to be, the Hague?

148
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,698
What?
Marty! Hi.

149
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:07,294
The new town's cheaper than
the old town. We'll save a fortune.

150
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,409
Because we don't have to
rebuild the old mill.

151
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:14,309
They've got an old mill.
They've got a firehouse.

152
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:18,884
Baby, baby, baby. I want to save
the money just as much as you do.

153
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:21,987
Just put it on the end
of the counter there.

154
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,486
Right on the counter.

155
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:27,889
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You wiped out the board.

156
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:30,291
Dinner with the mayor.
Write it big.

157
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:32,693
Just what we need,
to miss that dinner with the Mayor.

158
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:35,397
Marty, we must talk
about the schedule.

159
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:38,094
I need an extra day
on the dead horse gag.

160
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:40,405
I'm serious.

161
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:44,202
It gets worse. I need another
half day on the old mill pond.

162
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:46,903
We can't shoot in the old mill.

163
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:50,674
Marty, one sec...
Call me back. Two minutes.

164
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,181
We can't shoot
in the old mill.

165
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,878
I just talked to the mayor
he told me anything we need.

166
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:57,387
- It burnt down.
- When did it burn down?

167
00:10:57,523 --> 00:10:59,081
1960

168
00:11:01,627 --> 00:11:05,188
'Part of a spate of
suspicious fires, the old mill... '

169
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,799
- You said they had an old mill.
- 'Suspicion of arson.

170
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:10,197
The fires, believed
set by a teenager...

171
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:13,499
were the inspiration
for the Waterford Huskies.'

172
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:14,697
Hi

173
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,502
Must it be an old mill?
Where have you been?

174
00:11:17,643 --> 00:11:20,009
I was in New Hampshire
at the old location.

175
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:21,909
We can't shoot the old mill.

176
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:24,380
That's the truest words
you'll ever hear.

177
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:28,283
They told me there would be jokes.
Kid the new guy.

178
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:31,584
- That's not quite it.
- The old mill burnt down.

179
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:36,889
'- Can't you build the old mill?
- We're out of money.

180
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,894
You built it in New Hampshire.

181
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:42,000
They're holding
the old mill for ransom.

182
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:46,304
Why did we have to
leave New Hampshire?

183
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,605
Hello? Marty.

184
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:58,876
What would they have used instead
of an old mill? I need it tonight.

185
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:01,885
- Marty, you were saying?
- I can't write it.

186
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:03,181
Why?

187
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:06,382
- I lost my typewriter.
- Get Mr. White a typewriter.

188
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:08,390
I can only write on manual.

189
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:09,892
I know the feeling.

190
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:11,496
Typewriter for Mr. White!

191
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:15,896
You know, that's a lie.
You know, that's a real fault.

192
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:19,004
It's not a lie,
it's a gift for fiction.

193
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:22,097
Off you go.

194
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:24,804
Bill.

195
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:29,908
- How big is this horse?
- Fifteen hands.

196
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:34,281
What is that in fingers?
Just kidding. Get me this horse.

197
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,980
- That horse is booked.
- Get me this horse.

198
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:40,581
Tell the guy I'll give him
an associate producer credit.

199
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:54,001
I'll give the horse
an associate producer credit.

200
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:59,541
Put a VHS, an air-conditioner
and a fridge in that room, she'll blow.

201
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:01,408
The labor with a first child

202
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:04,175
can sometimes be
prolonged, as much as...

203
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:06,284
What's an
associate producer credit?

204
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:09,285
It's what you give to your
secretary instead of a raise.

205
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:11,087
This isn't Evian water.

206
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:13,282
- It's water.
- Can't sign for it. Sorry.

207
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:15,985
- She's going to blow.
- You rewire.

208
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,596
I rewire, I got to tear out
half the wall.

209
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:20,599
I'm looking for my typewriter.

210
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:22,792
I found lilacs!

211
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:24,800
Why don't you put them
in her room?

212
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,903
Tommy, you got to send somebody
running for a new dead horse.

213
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,305
Did they find my typewriter?

214
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:32,910
Oh, my God.

215
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:38,977
I told you! All of you get back!
This man is a guest here!

216
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:41,580
- Hi, I'm...
- Sir, I know who you are.

217
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,780
- Bob Barrenger, I'm with the movie.
- Sir, we're so...

218
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:46,482
Front! Front!

219
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:52,086
I know everybody says this, but
I've seen every one of your movies.

220
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:53,994
Show Mr. Barrenger
to his room.

221
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:56,897
Your room's 214 through 217.
I'm Scott Larkin.

222
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:59,197
Anything you need,
this is my private line.

223
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,397
Thank you, Scottie.
I'm just here to do a job...

224
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:05,101
- Hey, Bob
- Hey, Tommy.

225
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:07,712
Heard your wife's having a baby.
Do you know who the father is?

226
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:10,475
- They think it's your first wife.
- That could be.

227
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,485
Get out of here.

228
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:18,386
I'll get you a list of Mr. Barrenger's
dietary requirements.

229
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,992
Chuckie, not today.
Mr. Barrenger's just arrived.

230
00:14:21,126 --> 00:14:23,185
That's all right.

231
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,793
Chuckie.
How do you spell that, son?

232
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:28,490
With an IE?

233
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:33,296
- Chuck, what are your hobbies?
- Baseball!

234
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:34,804
Baseball?

235
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:38,604
Chuckie...

236
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:41,008
that's the national sport.

237
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:46,284
Thank you.

238
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,986
Here you go, Dad.

239
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:53,590
In the land of freedom, we get to
choose what we have for breakfast.

240
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,694
You think that's nothing,
go live under Communism.

241
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:58,296
Here's your bowl of kasha
Eat it and shut up.

242
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:00,694
Vanilla frappe.
Two tuna BLT's.

243
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,996
- What's a Tuna BLT?
- It's for the movie people.

244
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:08,095
Well, I'm glad of a little diversion.
I'm glad they're here.

245
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,004
I'm saying, we have to
look out for our own.

246
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:12,701
They want to close down Main St.

247
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:15,814
You want to talk about Main St.,
why don't you fix the pothole?

248
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:18,473
Doug, its...
Three, four days.

249
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:22,075
You know what we'll have?
A record of our wonderful life.

250
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:27,284
Annie, stick to the amateur theatricals.
This is not quite the same thing.

251
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:31,487
This is big business, in which
our life is no less a commodity than...

252
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:34,190
- Help me out here. Than our...
- Water or mineral deposits.

253
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,198
Well, that's what I'm saying.

254
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:39,596
- I think they're nice.
- I'm sure they are.

255
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:45,902
Why? Because they don't
live under Communism.

256
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:47,012
Communism's over.

257
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:50,172
They said that about
Warner Brothers, 1985...

258
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:52,375
but look at their
price-per-share today.

259
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:54,782
Hard to argue with that.

260
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,184
Dad, I've got to go to
Terry's to study.

261
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:58,984
Be home by nine.

262
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:02,587
I want to tell you something.

263
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:05,390
You stay soft all your life,
people despise you.

264
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:08,193
It awakens avarice in them,
they take advantage of you.

265
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:10,199
That's human nature.

266
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,104
Will you be home tonight?

267
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:15,001
I might have something
important to tell you.

268
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,700
- What is it, a surprise?
- That's right.

269
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:23,676
She could have
done better than him.

270
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,374
It takes all kinds.

271
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:28,975
That's what it takes?
I always wondered what it took.

272
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,590
Excuse me.

273
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:39,994
Your sign says
you'll be back at two o'clock.

274
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:41,690
It's a quarter to three.

275
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:57,474
- You're doing a play.
- Local drama group.

276
00:16:58,217 --> 00:16:59,582
Northern Books.

277
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:02,480
No, it hasn't come in yet.

278
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:04,486
As soon as it does.

279
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:06,489
You too, Marge.

280
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,691
Small town. You have to
make your own fun.

281
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:16,892
If you don't make it yourself,
it ain't fun, it's entertainment.

282
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:20,496
See my point?
Northern Books.

283
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,402
What can I do for you?

284
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,202
I need a typewriter.

285
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:25,503
We got them.

286
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:30,274
No, Henry James was the novelist.
Frank James was a criminal.

287
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,976
Yeah, you came
to the right place.

288
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:35,177
Jessie James was the brother.

289
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:38,385
Of the novelist, that's right.

290
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:41,687
That's all right, Susie.
See you tomorrow, Susie.

291
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:49,394
- I'll rent this one.
- Why not buy it? Forty bucks.

292
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:52,003
I had one, but they lost it.

293
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:55,106
Buy this, I'll get it
spruced up good as new.

294
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,299
Better than new,
because it has history.

295
00:17:57,443 --> 00:18:00,412
Other one had history too.
I wrote my play on it.

296
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:02,912
- What play is that?
- You never heard of it.

297
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:04,379
What's it called?

298
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:06,381
Anguish.

299
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:09,487
Anguish by Joseph Turner White?

300
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:11,589
You're Joseph Turner White?

301
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:13,782
- That's right.
- Afternoon, Annie.

302
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:18,295
Girls, this man wrote this play.

303
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,294
That a fact?

304
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:22,992
- Is it a good play?
- Yes, Maude. It is a very good play.

305
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:25,501
A very good play, indeed.

306
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:28,906
- What's he doing here?
- What're you doing here?

307
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:31,908
- Writing the movie.
- You're writing the movie?

308
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:34,205
- Yeah
- What's it about?

309
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:36,405
It's about the quest for purity.

310
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:42,687
Scene blah, blah, blah.
They meet.

311
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:47,190
'Sister, I've just come from a fire.
There're things I want to think out.'

312
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:48,987
That's bad because?

313
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,096
He wouldn't say that. Look:

314
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:54,791
'Sister, I've just come from a fire.
There're things I want to think out.'

315
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:59,302
Come on. Come on.
'Leave me alone' a gesture, all right?

316
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:01,099
- What else?
- Page three.

317
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,403
'Lt's a nice evening.' I'm not going
to say that 'lt's a nice evening.'

318
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:08,212
- Come on.
- Yeah, come in.

319
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:11,778
Joe, good. You know Bob?

320
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:13,682
I grew up on your movies.

321
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,684
You mind if I don't
go through the usual bullshit

322
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,482
about how much I loved it?

323
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:20,387
I mean Ok, fine.
But it's a motion picture.

324
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:23,290
- You'll bore them to death.
- Come in.

325
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:27,699
I brought your sandwich.

326
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:32,293
Thanks, honey. Next time,
bring two, save yourself a trip.

327
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:35,804
The people came to see
a motion picture.

328
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:38,409
- Hold on.
- No, no. You can go.

329
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:42,213
Page five:
The fucking horse dies.

330
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:45,180
- She could be in the movie.
- Oh, boy

331
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:47,182
She's got a good face.
She could be the doctor's...

332
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:49,685
Why does it have to be his wife?
It could be...

333
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:52,381
Bob, stick to business, will you?

334
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:55,186
- Can we do that?
- You're absolutely right.

335
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:58,589
You go start
with that stuff in this town...

336
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,595
Hey, everybody needs a hobby.

337
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:02,791
Okay, look. Page...

338
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:05,996
Claire.

339
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,202
You know Bob Barrenger?

340
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:12,902
I just saw Desert Sun.
I want to tell you...

341
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:16,879
No, I was just learning on it.

342
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:18,073
How'd you like working
with Richard Hill?

343
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:22,381
- Oh, I loved it.
- He's a real...

344
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:24,787
Joe White.

345
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:29,187
How can I thank you?

346
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:34,391
How can I repay you for this part?

347
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:38,594
Thank you for this part.
The first scene at the old mill...

348
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:43,105
Joe's been having some thoughts
about the old mill scene, Claire.

349
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,210
What is there to think about?

350
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:48,006
The scene is perfect.
I get to say...

351
00:20:48,146 --> 00:20:52,583
Yeah, but, Joe's been, well,
he's been having a few thoughts.

352
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:57,087
How many times in your life
do you get a speech like that?

353
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,983
This scene is why
I'm doing the movie.

354
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:04,584
'Look at the mill, Frank.
Look at the way it goes around.

355
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:08,689
Half of the time, the darned wheel's
under water, but still it rises up.

356
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:12,600
It rises up.
As high as it can go.'

357
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:22,111
Yeah... That's true...

358
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:24,875
Joe, you want to...

359
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:29,078
tell Claire about
the thoughts you've been having...

360
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,090
about the old mill scene.

361
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:58,275
So young, so innocent,
so full of promise.

362
00:21:58,417 --> 00:22:00,282
I beg your pardon?

363
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:09,790
I've got your typewriter.

364
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:11,589
I don't need it. I quit.

365
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,698
- You quit?
- Quit the movie.

366
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,493
Why'd you quit?

367
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:17,499
Hey! Why would you quit?

368
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:21,902
Why I quit is not important.
But thank you for your help.

369
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:43,388
Actually, I'm not sure if I quit.
I think I got fired.

370
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:44,790
No.

371
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:47,592
I'm such a liar.
I never could tell the truth.

372
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:49,291
Don't be hard on yourself.

373
00:22:49,434 --> 00:22:53,302
But, I just got kicked off
my first movie.

374
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,599
Well, everybody has reversals.

375
00:22:56,742 --> 00:23:00,303
If you were never down, how would
you know when you were up?

376
00:23:00,946 --> 00:23:02,607
You have a gift for words.

377
00:23:02,748 --> 00:23:04,477
It's in your play.

378
00:23:10,922 --> 00:23:13,288
Evening, Annie.
See you at rehearsal.

379
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:14,392
You know your line?

380
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:18,189
'Rise, one need not bend the knee
before the throne of justice.'

381
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:21,299
- Go you Huskies.
- Go you Huskies.

382
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:22,991
He leaves the clothing
out all night?

383
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:24,500
Yup

384
00:23:24,836 --> 00:23:27,896
- Isn't he afraid it'll get stolen?
- Ain't worth stealing.

385
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,898
Only thing in town worth anything
is that stained glass window.

386
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:36,876
Waterford
historic firehouse, 1851.

387
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:40,280
Do you ever wonder why Dalmatian's
the symbol of the firehouse?

388
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:43,388
First organized fire department was
on the border of Dalmatian Sardinia...

389
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:45,581
in the year 642.

390
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:50,886
- That's why the Dalmatian?
- It was either that or a sardine.

391
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:56,591
Morning, Bucky.

392
00:23:58,336 --> 00:24:01,100
There you go, pal.

393
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:02,706
You grow up here?

394
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:05,708
Central High, and matinees,
the Bijou Theater.

395
00:24:05,844 --> 00:24:08,108
- Nice town.
- Oh, yeah.

396
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:13,982
You want to talk about it?

397
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:25,089
You see...

398
00:24:27,432 --> 00:24:31,198
the sanctity...
of everyday things...

399
00:24:31,336 --> 00:24:34,601
- Everyday things, yes.
- For example:

400
00:24:34,739 --> 00:24:38,197
He's coming from a fire and...

401
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:41,412
That's a fine house.

402
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:44,481
When you look at that,
you know nice people live there.

403
00:24:44,616 --> 00:24:46,174
I live there.

404
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:49,776
Really? With the porch swing
and everything.

405
00:24:49,921 --> 00:24:51,786
Surest thing you know.

406
00:24:55,126 --> 00:24:57,686
I don't mean to impose, but...

407
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:00,794
do you think we might...

408
00:25:00,932 --> 00:25:02,695
That's what the swing's there for.

409
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:05,198
That's what the swing
is there for?

410
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:08,001
That's its purpose, isn't it?

411
00:25:08,139 --> 00:25:10,004
I always thought so.

412
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:22,880
It's such a pleasant sound.

413
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:28,286
Because it's...

414
00:25:28,426 --> 00:25:31,486
it's the simple things, that...

415
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:33,393
Well, there you are.

416
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:37,193
And have I got big news for you.

417
00:25:38,336 --> 00:25:41,999
This is Joe White and this is...

418
00:25:45,243 --> 00:25:48,804
My fianc, Doug MacKenzie.

419
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:50,778
It's a pleasure.

420
00:25:51,316 --> 00:25:54,581
Guess who is this close
to a nomination to State Senate.

421
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:58,883
Which is this close
to one step from Congress.

422
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:00,986
Who?

423
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:12,896
It was lovely meeting...

424
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:15,199
Mister White
is working on the movie.

425
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,399
- It's a pleasure meeting you.
- And we were just...

426
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:21,706
They were coy at first.
I said, 'The people are tired.

427
00:26:21,846 --> 00:26:25,475
They'll vote their pocketbook, yes,
but they'll vote their heart.

428
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:28,085
How do I know? I'm out there
with them every day.

429
00:26:28,219 --> 00:26:31,188
Go down to the lumber mills.
Go down to the trucks stops...

430
00:27:03,321 --> 00:27:05,687
What happened in 1975?

431
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:17,601
In 197...

432
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,701
Don't run off.

433
00:27:24,943 --> 00:27:27,605
Don't run off. We need you.

434
00:27:27,746 --> 00:27:29,111
You know why?

435
00:27:29,948 --> 00:27:32,473
You're why we're here.

436
00:27:32,617 --> 00:27:34,778
Your script is why we're here.

437
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:39,185
Big deal, we fight a little bit.
You show me a family that doesn't.

438
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:42,293
But we got something good here.
You know what it is?

439
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:44,886
We're here to make a movie.

440
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:48,592
We can't use the old mill.
That happens.

441
00:27:48,733 --> 00:27:51,600
What you got to do is
figure out the essence.

442
00:27:51,736 --> 00:27:54,500
What is it that brought us
all here?

443
00:27:54,639 --> 00:27:56,698
It wasn't the building, Joe.

444
00:27:57,742 --> 00:27:59,107
It was an idea.

445
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:01,712
What is the essence
of your story, Joe?

446
00:28:02,447 --> 00:28:05,177
It's about a man
who gets a second chance.

447
00:28:05,316 --> 00:28:07,181
Then you write that.

448
00:28:07,318 --> 00:28:11,277
And then this is our second chance.
That's why we're all here.

449
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:13,084
I want to make a good film.

450
00:28:13,224 --> 00:28:14,191
I know you do.

451
00:28:14,325 --> 00:28:19,695
And maybe it will be
a better film without the old mill.

452
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:21,196
Hey, it's with the gods.

453
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:24,301
We don't have the money.
We got to write it out.

454
00:28:25,837 --> 00:28:27,395
And that's a lesson.

455
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:30,506
- Did you get your typewriter yet?
- No.

456
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:35,306
Grace, get on the other phone.
Get Mr. White his typewriter.

457
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:37,472
Yeah, Have what's-her-name
send up some nosh.

458
00:28:37,615 --> 00:28:39,480
- What do you drink?
- I don't drink.

459
00:28:39,617 --> 00:28:41,778
Did my matzos come?

460
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,979
Get some for everybody.

461
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:45,487
Thank you.

462
00:28:46,324 --> 00:28:48,383
Let me tell you
about my first picture.

463
00:29:09,948 --> 00:29:11,575
The chairs go.

464
00:29:11,716 --> 00:29:14,583
- The La-Z-Boy goes.
- Not the La-Z-Boy.

465
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:16,380
The La-Z-Boy goes.

466
00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:19,388
- Hi, Sherry. Where do you want it?
- In the living room.

467
00:29:19,524 --> 00:29:22,584
- And we have thirteen at table.
- We don't have thirteen.

468
00:29:22,727 --> 00:29:24,695
Bob Barrenger, Claire Wellesley,
the director.

469
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:25,989
Then, you can
invite someone else.

470
00:29:26,131 --> 00:29:28,998
I don't want to.
This is the most exclusive dinner...

471
00:29:29,134 --> 00:29:32,001
Do whatever makes you happy.

472
00:29:32,137 --> 00:29:33,900
I'll be back
with the butter churn.

473
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:36,097
And we need a blender bus.

474
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:39,506
That woman's gone crazy
about this dinner party.

475
00:29:39,644 --> 00:29:43,375
George, I want
a city council meeting.

476
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:46,973
City council?
Doug, the traffic light...

477
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:48,085
Fuck the trafic light.

478
00:29:48,219 --> 00:29:51,882
I'm talking about three percent of
the adjusted gross of a major movie

479
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:55,786
Hi...

480
00:29:56,227 --> 00:29:57,990
I love your script.

481
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:01,494
- What?
- You're still here.

482
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:04,397
- Morning, Annie.
- See you at rehearsal tonight.

483
00:30:04,536 --> 00:30:08,700
'Ln the name of justice, sir,
I bid you pause, for she is our queen.'

484
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,807
That's very good.

485
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:10,908
In fact...

486
00:30:11,042 --> 00:30:15,206
I'm not sure if I gave them a second
chance or they're giving it to me.

487
00:30:15,346 --> 00:30:17,780
That's the truth.
The truth's best, don't you think?

488
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:19,679
You'd know better than me.

489
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,877
How can you say that?

490
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:23,882
It's in your script.

491
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:26,786
It's about getting
a second chance, isn't it?

492
00:30:26,925 --> 00:30:30,793
- 'You can go back.'
- How do I...

493
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:35,798
How do I do a film called The Old Mill
when I don't have an old mill?

494
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:38,402
First, you got to change the title.

495
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:43,303
No, he doesn't want to work
out with the Waterford Huskies.

496
00:30:43,441 --> 00:30:45,409
Because he's Bob Barrenger.

497
00:30:45,543 --> 00:30:48,011
Tell his girl in Aspen
to ship his weights.

498
00:30:48,146 --> 00:30:49,408
There you go, sir.

499
00:30:49,547 --> 00:30:52,482
Well, fine. Then he won't
do the pond scene.

500
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:54,585
Not unless he can work out.

501
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:58,778
Call his girl in Aspen.
Get her to ship the weights out.

502
00:30:59,724 --> 00:31:01,589
How much can they weigh?

503
00:31:02,627 --> 00:31:03,286
Are these the ones?

504
00:31:03,428 --> 00:31:06,488
Yes, who designed
these costumes?

505
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:09,395
Who designed them?
It looks like Edith Head puked

506
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:12,594
and that puke designed them.
Get Courtney.

507
00:31:12,737 --> 00:31:15,501
- Your wife's on the phone.
- I have no wife.

508
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:17,803
Ok...

509
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:24,272
We need a new name
for the movie. Where's the writer?

510
00:31:24,415 --> 00:31:25,575
Roger.

511
00:31:27,318 --> 00:31:31,687
Wally, I got to takes out
the window from the dog.

512
00:31:31,823 --> 00:31:33,791
- I can't shoot through...
- What?

513
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:35,392
Claire has a problem.

514
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:38,086
Wally, If I have
a moment of your time, look here.

515
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:40,288
I can not do this
shot you want.

516
00:31:40,431 --> 00:31:43,195
- Why not?
- It gots a window with a dogs in it.

517
00:31:43,334 --> 00:31:45,700
Should I push in,
or lose the shot?

518
00:31:45,837 --> 00:31:48,305
No, no, no.
You cannot lose the shot.

519
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:50,600
The meaning
of the film is in that shot.

520
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:51,902
But, Wally,
the window to the firehut...

521
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:54,705
I don't care. Fix it.

522
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:58,181
Courtney...

523
00:31:59,517 --> 00:32:00,882
did you show Claire these?

524
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:02,782
- Yes.
- Did she throw up?

525
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,286
That's not very nice.

526
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:07,391
Oh, really? Why don't you
sue me in the world court?

527
00:32:07,525 --> 00:32:09,083
Did she like the costumes?

528
00:32:09,227 --> 00:32:10,592
- I can't tell.
- Why not?

529
00:32:10,728 --> 00:32:12,491
She won't stop crying.

530
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:14,097
Oh, goody.

531
00:32:14,232 --> 00:32:17,793
Find out when Marty Rossen's
arriving. Get lilacs for the broad.

532
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:19,494
Town's out of lilacs.

533
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:24,602
You go to her room.
You take the lilacs from the water

534
00:32:24,742 --> 00:32:29,805
dry them, get some cellophane,
wrap them up, get a card from Marty.

535
00:32:30,515 --> 00:32:31,573
Right.

536
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:34,478
What's her problem?

537
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:36,280
She doesn't want to
bare her breasts.

538
00:32:36,421 --> 00:32:38,981
She doesn't wanna bare her
breasts. What? In the nude scene?

539
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:40,988
Why are we paying her
three million dollars?

540
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:42,683
She got religion.

541
00:32:42,827 --> 00:32:46,285
Her religion bars her
from fulfilling her contract.

542
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:48,729
What is she doing in there?

543
00:32:49,834 --> 00:32:50,994
What?

544
00:33:22,233 --> 00:33:23,791
Claire.

545
00:33:24,535 --> 00:33:25,900
Claire.

546
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:29,800
Claire.

547
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:34,605
What is it, pal?

548
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:37,778
What?

549
00:33:39,417 --> 00:33:41,180
I can't do it, Walt.

550
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:42,479
You can't do what?

551
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:46,886
It isn't right. I can't.
I know I signed the contract.

552
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:50,586
I don't know if they told me
it was in the contract.

553
00:33:50,728 --> 00:33:53,094
Forget the contract, Claire.
What is it?

554
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:56,200
I don't want to
take my shirt off.

555
00:33:56,334 --> 00:33:59,599
What are these things
they're asking of me?

556
00:33:59,737 --> 00:34:02,297
I try to be good.
All I care about is...

557
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,805
I know that.

558
00:34:03,941 --> 00:34:06,705
- Is the movie.
- I know that. We all know.

559
00:34:06,844 --> 00:34:08,505
Everybody, they...

560
00:34:08,646 --> 00:34:11,877
- They treat me like a child.
- No, they don't.

561
00:34:12,016 --> 00:34:13,779
Now, Claire.

562
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:16,580
To bare my body.

563
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:18,586
What are they asking of me?

564
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:20,987
Now, look, Claire.

565
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:23,093
I want to tell you a story.

566
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:24,694
What?

567
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:31,493
Fuck flowers.
This isn't about flowers.

568
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:33,900
This is about a human being.

569
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,400
Lilacs.

570
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:39,100
- Who are these from?
- Marty.

571
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:42,110
Well, that's very
thoughtful of him.

572
00:34:44,816 --> 00:34:46,181
- Eleanora Duse.
- I can't.

573
00:34:46,317 --> 00:34:51,482
Listen to me. Eleanora Duse was
playing Hamlet in London in 1905.

574
00:34:51,622 --> 00:34:53,988
And royalty
could not get a ticket.

575
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:58,585
She said, 'I'm not doing the
seven shows a week I signed for.'

576
00:34:58,729 --> 00:35:03,496
She said, 'I can't bare my soul
seven times a week. I am an artist.

577
00:35:03,634 --> 00:35:05,192
I'll do four shows a week.'

578
00:35:05,336 --> 00:35:07,201
The greatest actress of her time.

579
00:35:07,338 --> 00:35:09,602
And do you know
what her producer said?

580
00:35:10,241 --> 00:35:15,201
- What?
- Nothing. He held her and he wept.

581
00:35:15,346 --> 00:35:20,477
Because he understood that that
was her life's blood on the stage.

582
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:23,485
I know. I know.

583
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:27,489
And did she?
She did the seven shows?

584
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:31,083
No, Claire, she didn't.
But I think you should do this scene.

585
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:34,790
- Wally
- I know. I know. I know.

586
00:35:34,932 --> 00:35:36,991
It's the hardest thing
in the world.

587
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:40,696
And sometimes it seems
that everybody wants a...

588
00:35:40,838 --> 00:35:43,398
- Wants a piece of us.
- Yes!

589
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:45,008
And do you know what?

590
00:35:47,245 --> 00:35:49,008
We have to give it.

591
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:52,981
What's her problem? She removes
her shirt to do a voice over.

592
00:35:53,718 --> 00:35:57,586
What's her problem? The country
could draw her tits from memory.

593
00:36:08,132 --> 00:36:10,999
Bill, call her agent in New York.

594
00:36:11,135 --> 00:36:14,901
Tell him she's breaking her contract.
We're very upset with her.

595
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:18,497
Get someone to double for her,
her tits, the tits scene.

596
00:36:18,643 --> 00:36:22,101
Call L.A. I want to see
pictures of women's tits.

597
00:36:22,246 --> 00:36:23,110
I'm very sorry.

598
00:36:23,247 --> 00:36:26,273
You're very sorry, you
passive aggressive, son of a bitch!

599
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:29,181
- Can we replace him?
- We shoot in three days.

600
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:32,483
You wanna see the firman's costume
I found this moleskin for collars.

601
00:36:32,623 --> 00:36:34,386
Marty Rossen's touched down.

602
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:37,187
It's not black,
but looks black. Not brown...

603
00:36:37,328 --> 00:36:40,593
Yup. It's faggy
without being homosexual.

604
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:47,697
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

605
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:51,103
He gets a second chance,
and you get a second chance.

606
00:36:51,242 --> 00:36:52,402
No, I don't.

607
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:54,408
He doesn't go back to the mill.

608
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:57,981
He gets a second chance
to go back to the firehouse.

609
00:36:58,115 --> 00:37:00,879
You don't need the old mill.

610
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,687
This is what... You see...

611
00:37:03,821 --> 00:37:06,381
this is what
the script is saying.

612
00:37:06,524 --> 00:37:07,183
Hi, Annie

613
00:37:07,325 --> 00:37:09,589
- Hi, Emma. See you tonight.
- Go you Huskies!

614
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:10,989
Go you Huskies!

615
00:37:11,128 --> 00:37:14,393
You have the two elements,
fire and water.

616
00:37:14,532 --> 00:37:17,797
The firehouse, and the old mill.
You know? You could...

617
00:37:17,935 --> 00:37:20,802
- What are you doing tonight?
- Me?

618
00:37:20,938 --> 00:37:24,806
Tonight? Tonight
I have play practice.

619
00:37:28,045 --> 00:37:30,570
Well, that's important.

620
00:37:34,051 --> 00:37:35,916
Come on, people. Let's go!

621
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:39,480
Yeah.

622
00:37:40,024 --> 00:37:42,993
Let's go, let's go!
Come on, come on.

623
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:49,195
- You cool the broad out?
- No, I left that for you.

624
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:50,994
That's thoughtful.

625
00:37:51,135 --> 00:37:54,195
- This is good. You try this?
- Oh, I'm going to eat carbohydrates.

626
00:37:54,338 --> 00:37:56,397
Hey, dump this somewhere.

627
00:38:00,645 --> 00:38:02,909
- Did you build this?
- How was your flight?

628
00:38:03,047 --> 00:38:05,277
We're flying over pigs and sheep.

629
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:08,476
- Did you bring Bob's weights?
- They're coming FedEx.

630
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:09,984
What's in the bags?

631
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:13,284
My undies. If you can't get the
picture off on time I'll wet myself.

632
00:38:13,424 --> 00:38:16,985
- I'll get it off.
- 55 days I take home the camera.

633
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:19,596
I got an idea
for a product placement.

634
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:21,391
- Hi, Sally.
- Hiya, Doc.

635
00:38:21,532 --> 00:38:23,693
- How's the arm?
- Still itching.

636
00:38:23,834 --> 00:38:26,598
Good.
A sign it's getting well.

637
00:38:27,438 --> 00:38:28,996
Afternoon.

638
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,604
- Stop.
- That's what I told you.

639
00:38:31,742 --> 00:38:34,108
How are you getting on
with these fine people?

640
00:38:34,245 --> 00:38:36,304
Like dykes and dogs.

641
00:38:37,214 --> 00:38:39,682
Did you see the grosses
for Gandhi 2?

642
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:46,688
Yeah. Come in.

643
00:38:48,926 --> 00:38:50,188
Oh, good.

644
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:53,492
I just...

645
00:38:56,534 --> 00:38:58,195
Prices are going up.

646
00:39:00,037 --> 00:39:02,904
That's the way of the world, isn't it?
Everybody's got to eat.

647
00:39:04,141 --> 00:39:05,608
Way of the world.

648
00:39:07,545 --> 00:39:10,878
Well, I'm being pretty impolite.

649
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:12,880
Would you like some?

650
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:14,985
I don't eat vegetables.

651
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:18,479
I could offer you
something to drink.

652
00:39:18,622 --> 00:39:20,783
Sure, what have you got?

653
00:39:20,925 --> 00:39:22,483
What do you drink?

654
00:39:22,626 --> 00:39:24,685
Bourbon and milk.

655
00:39:27,431 --> 00:39:29,194
How old are you?

656
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:40,206
I hope you wouldn't tell anyone
that I gave this to you.

657
00:39:40,845 --> 00:39:43,109
I would never tell anyone anything
that happened between

658
00:39:43,247 --> 00:39:45,579
me and my friend.

659
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:56,591
Nice town you got here.

660
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:59,287
We could see it a lot better
from the roof.

661
00:40:00,431 --> 00:40:03,195
Wouldn't that be dangerous?

662
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:05,802
Not if you have something
to hold on to.

663
00:40:12,042 --> 00:40:17,070
The requirement is
you tell me what the shot is.

664
00:40:17,214 --> 00:40:20,479
Because if you cannot
tells me what is it...

665
00:40:20,618 --> 00:40:22,677
how can I take pictures of it?

666
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:28,190
Wally wants me to
push in through the window.

667
00:40:28,826 --> 00:40:29,986
How can I push in
through the window?

668
00:40:30,127 --> 00:40:31,890
Telephone.

669
00:40:32,029 --> 00:40:33,394
Sucuza

670
00:40:39,336 --> 00:40:40,598
Sure.

671
00:40:51,015 --> 00:40:54,781
- Hello. How are you?
- I thought you had play practice.

672
00:40:54,919 --> 00:40:57,285
- What happened?
- Cast stood me up.

673
00:40:57,421 --> 00:41:00,788
They're all preparing
for the auditions for your movie.

674
00:41:03,327 --> 00:41:05,295
My glasses fell apart.
I lost...

675
00:41:05,429 --> 00:41:07,090
Lost the screw?

676
00:41:07,231 --> 00:41:08,892
- Evening, Annie.
- Evening, sweetheart.

677
00:41:09,033 --> 00:41:11,501
- Go you Huskies!
- You said it.

678
00:41:14,738 --> 00:41:16,103
Do you like kids?

679
00:41:16,941 --> 00:41:19,102
I never saw the point of them.

680
00:41:19,243 --> 00:41:20,710
Me too.

681
00:41:22,046 --> 00:41:23,308
You have a paper clip?

682
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:25,974
- To fix my glasses.
- Better idea.

683
00:41:28,018 --> 00:41:30,179
- Hold up, Kathy. I need you.
- Ok.

684
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:32,380
Oh, watch out for that lure.

685
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:36,893
Can I get some
fishing line from you?

686
00:41:38,229 --> 00:41:40,197
Okay, let's see what we got.

687
00:41:45,436 --> 00:41:47,996
A little fishing line
and country wisdom...

688
00:41:48,138 --> 00:41:49,901
and the world's our oyster.

689
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,406
I'll fix you up
with a brand-new hinge.

690
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:54,010
Will be good as new.

691
00:41:54,144 --> 00:41:56,612
Better than new,
because it has a story.

692
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:59,676
Presto chango.

693
00:41:59,817 --> 00:42:04,777
The inherently helpful qualities
of everyday household things.

694
00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:09,284
- There you go.
- Thank you. Let me try.

695
00:42:11,428 --> 00:42:13,396
Careful you don't burn yourself.

696
00:42:20,938 --> 00:42:24,499
You know what you got there?
A fishhook in your finger.

697
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:27,511
I'm right proud of you.

698
00:42:30,314 --> 00:42:32,282
Let me tell yousomething
Wally is a pussycat.

699
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:35,579
My thing is to see everybody
does what they said they would.

700
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:36,583
Now, what is this?

701
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:40,178
You want $800,000 to do
what you're being paid to?

702
00:42:40,324 --> 00:42:42,690
You already signed you'd do?
What is that?

703
00:42:42,826 --> 00:42:46,592
I think I should talk
to my agent, Marty. You and I...

704
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:48,288
- Who's her agent?
- Mitch Cohen.

705
00:42:48,432 --> 00:42:50,297
- Get him on the phone.
- He's on the Island...

706
00:42:50,434 --> 00:42:52,994
get him on the phone.
I want you to hear this.

707
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:54,601
It's ringing.

708
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:57,901
I think that business matters
should be discussed between...

709
00:42:58,042 --> 00:43:00,909
I'm discussing them between you,
babe, because it's your idea.

710
00:43:01,045 --> 00:43:03,673
And you think you're going
to sign to do a job, then hold us up,

711
00:43:03,814 --> 00:43:05,076
Sweetheart, you're in error.

712
00:43:05,215 --> 00:43:07,183
- He's on the phone.
- Thank you.

713
00:43:07,318 --> 00:43:09,684
Mitch, this is Marty Rossen.
I'm in...

714
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:12,983
I'm somewhere in the...
I'm on location.

715
00:43:13,123 --> 00:43:15,091
I'm going to solve it,
or this bimbo...

716
00:43:15,225 --> 00:43:18,786
will be doing a donkey act
on Public Access Television.

717
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:19,486
Hi

718
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:23,396
Her tits. Her tits.
Her tits. Her tits. Her tits.

719
00:43:23,534 --> 00:43:25,900
That she signed in her contract.

720
00:43:26,036 --> 00:43:28,300
We hired her because
of ten years at the Actors Studio?

721
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:32,603
Her last two pictures laid there
on the screen like my first wife.

722
00:43:32,743 --> 00:43:34,802
- You have no right...
- Cool it. You started this.

723
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:36,674
- What...
- Where have you been?

724
00:43:36,814 --> 00:43:39,282
No, you tell me. You tell me now.

725
00:43:39,416 --> 00:43:42,385
I got to shoot on Wednesday.
I won't pay your blood money.

726
00:43:42,519 --> 00:43:44,487
And P.S., I put the word out

727
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:47,887
and Betty Boop can find work
in squigglevision. Sit down.

728
00:43:48,025 --> 00:43:50,892
I don't think you should
talk to a lady like that.

729
00:43:51,028 --> 00:43:54,794
- Would you excuse me, please?
- You can't treat me like this.

730
00:43:54,932 --> 00:43:58,993
- She's absolutely right.
- I'm not a child. I have feelings.

731
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:02,594
I mean, don't you...
Don't... Don't...

732
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:04,503
Because I want to
tell you something

733
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:07,509
and I think
you know what I mean.

734
00:44:10,914 --> 00:44:14,475
Well, you call him,
and call me back. But this is it, pal.

735
00:44:14,618 --> 00:44:19,487
You fuck with me, I'll tear out
your heart and piss on your lungs.

736
00:44:19,623 --> 00:44:21,386
And the best to Marion.

737
00:44:22,126 --> 00:44:23,184
Where have you been?

738
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:24,885
He says they're
looking for you all day.

739
00:44:25,029 --> 00:44:29,398
You're on salary. He needs pages.
You been haying? Now...

740
00:44:29,533 --> 00:44:32,900
Later, Walt. Let's get this.
We need the pages for The Old Mill.

741
00:44:33,037 --> 00:44:36,905
- We need a new title, a...
- Rewrite for Bob's dead horse scene.

742
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:39,601
Go do it.
How you doing on the permit?

743
00:44:39,743 --> 00:44:42,109
- It's just a formality.
- That's why I want it.

744
00:44:42,246 --> 00:44:44,077
Type it and get it back to me at...

745
00:44:44,214 --> 00:44:45,374
I can't.

746
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:48,576
- Don't tell me you can't write it?
- I can't type it.

747
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:49,777
Why?

748
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,285
Hurt my finger.

749
00:44:51,422 --> 00:44:54,880
Get him a typist.
Get out of here.

750
00:44:55,926 --> 00:44:58,190
Get out, or we'll have you killed.

751
00:45:02,733 --> 00:45:05,896
- Eight hundred grand to show her tits.
- Pay her.

752
00:45:06,036 --> 00:45:07,799
- I don't got the money.
- Find it.

753
00:45:07,938 --> 00:45:11,601
A company'll give us $1,000,000
to put their product in the film.

754
00:45:11,742 --> 00:45:13,903
- Product placement? What is it?
- Take a look.

755
00:45:16,246 --> 00:45:20,080
No, no, no...
Just find me the money.

756
00:45:29,526 --> 00:45:31,994
Okay. No, thank you. It's here.

757
00:45:32,129 --> 00:45:33,187
Come in.

758
00:45:34,131 --> 00:45:35,598
Hi.

759
00:45:37,134 --> 00:45:38,294
Hi...

760
00:45:38,435 --> 00:45:40,300
May I come in?

761
00:45:40,437 --> 00:45:41,802
Please.

762
00:45:49,546 --> 00:45:53,175
You said, 'You can't
talk that way to a lady.'

763
00:45:53,317 --> 00:45:55,581
You stood up for me.

764
00:45:57,521 --> 00:46:00,490
- What do you have to drink?
- I don't drink.

765
00:46:00,624 --> 00:46:02,592
Matzo.

766
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:07,794
Are you Jewish?

767
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:08,989
Well, actually...

768
00:46:09,133 --> 00:46:10,998
I love Jewish men.

769
00:46:12,136 --> 00:46:13,603
Why?

770
00:46:13,737 --> 00:46:15,705
You know.

771
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:18,599
Where's your bathroom?

772
00:46:22,746 --> 00:46:24,475
So, you liked the script?

773
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:33,987
- Where have you been?
- Hi.

774
00:46:37,828 --> 00:46:40,092
- We had a date.
- We did?

775
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:43,097
- Where have you been?
- I've been thinking.

776
00:46:43,233 --> 00:46:46,999
I know, because they told me
you were with that writer from the...

777
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:48,798
You see?
This is what I mean.

778
00:46:48,939 --> 00:46:53,308
The whole town's been warped by
the presence of the movie company.

779
00:46:53,443 --> 00:46:55,104
They holler, and we jump.

780
00:46:55,245 --> 00:46:57,975
You have a date. They call,
you do business 9:00 at night...

781
00:46:58,115 --> 00:47:00,879
I wasn't doing business.

782
00:47:01,218 --> 00:47:03,482
What were you doing that's so
important you shouldn't call your fianc?

783
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:09,388
I have to tell you that
it's all over between us, Doug.

784
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:14,787
I met somebody else

785
00:47:14,932 --> 00:47:18,197
and it's very serious
and it's over.

786
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:21,395
Wait, so serious you couldn't call
to tell me you'd be...

787
00:47:21,538 --> 00:47:22,698
What did you say?

788
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:27,106
It's all over between us.
I've met someone else.

789
00:47:28,245 --> 00:47:30,577
Who is this person
that you've found?

790
00:47:31,114 --> 00:47:32,877
He works on the movie.

791
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:35,576
No. Don't tell me that.

792
00:47:35,719 --> 00:47:37,584
I'm sorry.

793
00:47:47,431 --> 00:47:48,693
Can you type?

794
00:47:48,832 --> 00:47:52,495
If you can type, they need you
over at the hotel. Can you type?

795
00:47:52,636 --> 00:47:54,797
Never admit you can type.

796
00:47:55,339 --> 00:47:56,897
Ok...

797
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:09,776
All right, look.

798
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,478
I feel so close to you.

799
00:48:11,622 --> 00:48:13,283
I like you very much.

800
00:48:13,423 --> 00:48:14,981
I like you too.

801
00:48:15,125 --> 00:48:17,184
Look, I met someone.

802
00:48:18,829 --> 00:48:20,797
- Who is it?
- Room service.

803
00:48:20,931 --> 00:48:22,398
Could you leave it
outside the door?

804
00:48:22,532 --> 00:48:24,500
You have to sign for it.

805
00:48:26,637 --> 00:48:29,197
- Excuse me.
- Of course.

806
00:48:31,541 --> 00:48:33,304
- Hi
- Oh, God.

807
00:48:33,443 --> 00:48:36,412
I'm going to be your typist
for this evening.

808
00:48:36,546 --> 00:48:38,070
And here's some
hydrogen peroxide.

809
00:48:38,215 --> 00:48:40,877
- I don't drink.
- It's for your finger.

810
00:48:41,018 --> 00:48:42,883
That's very thoughtful.

811
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:45,887
Here I am.
Should we get down to it?

812
00:48:51,628 --> 00:48:54,096
- Thought you might like these.
- Thank you.

813
00:48:55,632 --> 00:48:57,497
Read the card.

814
00:48:57,634 --> 00:49:00,603
'To the love of my life.
Love, Doug.'

815
00:49:00,737 --> 00:49:02,295
The other side.

816
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:05,806
Wait. Wait.
Where are you going?

817
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:08,002
Shouldn't we put these in water?

818
00:49:08,145 --> 00:49:09,908
For God's sake, why?

819
00:49:10,013 --> 00:49:12,379
Because if you don't, they die.

820
00:49:14,918 --> 00:49:19,184
And in my opinion that makes
them so much less attractive.

821
00:49:19,323 --> 00:49:22,087
Wait. You shouldn't do that.

822
00:49:22,225 --> 00:49:23,385
Wait.

823
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:26,493
Yup.
The little things mean a lot.

824
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:30,691
Yes, little things mean a lot.
That's so true.

825
00:49:30,834 --> 00:49:32,995
For example,
I once had an uncle...

826
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:37,004
who was bit by a spider
and he lost his sense of smell.

827
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:40,507
- Can I have a cracker?
- Please.

828
00:49:47,617 --> 00:49:49,175
Shouldn't we start?

829
00:49:50,721 --> 00:49:52,586
Start?

830
00:49:53,223 --> 00:49:55,191
Start typing.

831
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:56,986
This isn't a good time.

832
00:49:57,127 --> 00:49:59,288
Oh. All right.

833
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:05,097
Then I'll come back
at a better time.

834
00:50:05,235 --> 00:50:07,795
- What would be a better time?
- Later on.

835
00:50:07,938 --> 00:50:09,997
Then I'll come back then.

836
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:17,677
You going out
with your fianc tonight?

837
00:50:17,814 --> 00:50:19,679
No. That's not happening.

838
00:50:21,118 --> 00:50:22,983
I'll see you tomorrow.

839
00:50:35,732 --> 00:50:36,994
Hi

840
00:50:38,135 --> 00:50:39,500
Hi

841
00:50:39,936 --> 00:50:43,099
It occurred to me you'd want to
have this memento of our...

842
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:46,698
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

843
00:50:48,445 --> 00:50:50,276
She came in here...

844
00:50:50,414 --> 00:50:52,075
Wait, she...

845
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:54,274
I was giving her a massage.

846
00:50:54,818 --> 00:50:56,285
Wait.

847
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:59,981
Wait. She came in here. She...

848
00:51:00,123 --> 00:51:02,785
With due respect,
she took off her clothes...

849
00:51:02,926 --> 00:51:05,895
and got into bed
and I said we could not

850
00:51:06,029 --> 00:51:07,587
because we don't
know each other.

851
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:09,699
We had a script conference.

852
00:51:09,833 --> 00:51:11,892
And I said thank you very much.

853
00:51:12,892 --> 00:51:22,892
