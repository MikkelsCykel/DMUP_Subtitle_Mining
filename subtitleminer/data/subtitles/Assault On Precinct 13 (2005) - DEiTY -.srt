<i>Listen to me.
What are we talkin' about, really?</i>

2
00:00:15,281 --> 00:00:18,444
Getting high? No.
We're talking about a journey, man.

3
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:23,649
A subconscious safari. A mental
expedition, okay? A mind trek.

4
00:00:23,723 --> 00:00:27,955
This planet has been raped,
pillaged and fucked, all right?

5
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:32,055
And the mind is-is the only
uncharted territory.

6
00:00:32,132 --> 00:00:36,068
<i>And this shit is the ship. It's the Nina,
the Pinta and the Santa Maria,</i>

7
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:38,263
and you are fuckin' Magellan.

8
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:42,274
Oh, fuck! I spilled some!

9
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:45,505
So what do you say,
my Serbian motherfuckin' friend?

10
00:00:45,578 --> 00:00:48,638
Do you wanna take a trip,
or do you wanna sit on your ass?

11
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,307
Okay, Napoleon,
let's see what you got.

12
00:00:55,121 --> 00:00:58,579
Robi.

13
00:00:58,658 --> 00:01:01,126
That dog is really creeping me out.

14
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:05,290
<i>It's a big fuckin' dog. It makes my girl
very uneasy. I don't really like dogs.</i>

15
00:01:05,365 --> 00:01:07,856
The pooch was not invited.

16
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:10,960
You don't talk about my fuckin' dog,
okay? I'll handle it.

17
00:01:11,037 --> 00:01:13,597
Can you tie it up or something?

18
00:01:13,673 --> 00:01:15,368
He'll do what I say.

19
00:01:16,876 --> 00:01:21,609
<i>Once I show him who's boss
with a few treats and some smacks.</i>

20
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:35,526
Good boy. Here's treat.

21
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,995
He knows who's boss, yes?

22
00:01:38,064 --> 00:01:40,396
Shit, man!
Hey, hey, I got a dog too.

23
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:44,369
<i>Yo, Tony.! I love this guy.
He works his ass off for piss.</i>

24
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:48,965
All right, once I show him who's boss
with some few smacks and some treatsies.

25
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:51,738
- You got that? You got a smoke?
- No, no. I'm fuckin' out. I told you.

26
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:55,872
<i>- Are you giving me some static?
- No.</i>

27
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:58,850
Huh? You giving me the hairy eyeball?
You Irish fucking pig!

28
00:01:58,918 --> 00:02:03,821
Fuck, man! See? Whoo!
I got my dog too.

29
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:13,031
<i>Here you go, dog.</i>

30
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:15,397
- Are you guys in? Are you in?
- Fuck you!

31
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:25,402
- What's your fucking lackey saying?
- He say that he knows your dog.

32
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:30,882
<i>- My dog?
- He say that your dog testify at his brother's trial three years ago.</i>

33
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:36,684
- Oh, shit.
- He also say that your dog is not even a fucking dog.

34
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:39,418
He's a dirty, fucking pig!

35
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:42,925
And I believe him.

36
00:02:44,697 --> 00:02:47,495
God!

37
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:54,967
- Fuck! Call for backup! Call for backup!
- Unit 17 requesting backup.

38
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:58,238
- Fuck!
- Fourth floor, one suspect.

39
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:00,643
<i>- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm all right. Come on!</i>

40
00:03:00,713 --> 00:03:03,580
Good dog. Good dog.
Shit! Shit!

41
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:06,949
All right, Coral, take that
back stairwell there. Got it.

42
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:11,286
Tony, come on. Come on.
Oh, shit. Okay.

43
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:13,723
You take this hallway on the right.
All right.

44
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:15,761
I'll take the left.
Gotcha.

45
00:03:15,828 --> 00:03:17,762
<i>Can you believe
that cocksucker shot me?</i>

46
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:20,890
<i>Shit.! Shit.!</i>

47
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,400
Tony! Tony?

48
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,342
Ah, shit! Ah!

49
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,812
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

50
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:42,878
Officer down!
I repeat: Officer down!

51
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:46,858
Suspect on north stairway!
I'm going after him!

52
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:49,656
And where the fuck is my backup!

53
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:08,376
Freeze! Shit!

54
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:24,963
Shit. Shit. Shit. Help me!

55
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:29,297
I'm a police officer! Help me!
Call an ambulance!

56
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:33,203
Shit! Shit! Call an ambulance!

57
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,207
Shit!

58
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:50,707
Hello? Yeah. Shit, yeah.

59
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:54,310
No. No, no, I'm up. I'm up.

60
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:57,049
I'll be right there. All right. Bye.

61
00:05:57,123 --> 00:06:00,889
Mornin', buddy.

62
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:04,819
Come here, shithead.
Come here.

63
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:07,823
Good morning.

64
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,040
Ohh!

65
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:07,459
<i>It's cold, people. Detroit's
gonna have a white New Year's this year,</i>

66
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:10,291
<i>because we're getting hit with
yet another storm. No shit!</i>

67
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:12,593
<i>Sports comin' up.</i>

68
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:48,590
<i>#In the lane, snow is glistening #</i>

69
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:52,195
<i>#A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight #</i>

70
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:55,263
This kind of sex
is evolutionary instinct, gentlemen.

71
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:59,744
Example: Tiger Stadium.
Bleachers empty, except me and a friend.

72
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:04,112
We always get it on
whenever and wherever we can.

73
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:06,344
<i>No one saw us
except for the left fielder.</i>

74
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:09,911
<i>Let's just say he enjoyed the show,
and I didn't mind the audience.</i>

75
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:13,425
Impulsive sex is in our genes, boys.
Don't deny yourselves.

76
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,757
I gotta go jump in the snow
to cool my shit off.

77
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:19,924
<i>- Have a good New Year, I.
- You too, babe.</i>

78
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,900
That animal was your type, Iris.
Probably an ex-con.

79
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:26,097
- You two should hook up.
- Fuck off, Carlyle.

80
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:29,073
We were just talking about acting
on impulses with no guilt.

81
00:08:29,141 --> 00:08:31,735
Don't get angry, I. You only bed
criminals. Everyone knows that.

82
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:34,279
Which is unfortunate for me,
because I am in love with you.

83
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,645
I don't bed criminals.
I fuck bad boys. Big difference.

84
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:40,311
I just hope I don't have to become
a fuckin' ax murderer to prove I'm worthy.

85
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:42,980
<i>What the hell is this? Fun and games?</i>

86
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:46,024
- Buzzkill.
- Does anybody work around here anymore?

87
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:48,026
Hey, Sarge. You're late.
Happy New Year.

88
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:50,927
Hey, you're pissing me off. Get outta here
before I give you something to do.

89
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:53,932
You boys don't wanna get stuck
with us here tonight. Bye, boys.

90
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,434
I'll see you guys at the new precinct.
Happy New Year, Iris.

91
00:08:56,502 --> 00:09:00,302
<i>Later, Iris. Stuck.
That's not very nice, boss.</i>

92
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:05,743
You're right. I apologize.
You're lovely and amazing,

93
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:09,611
and it's my honor
to spend New Year's Eve with you.

94
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:13,516
You're a sarcastic prick, aren't you? We
are going to have a good time tonight, boss.

95
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:16,817
We officially shut down at midnight,
but all calls are being diverted,

96
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:19,483
so we might as well be closed now.

97
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:22,323
We could start gettin' fucked up
real early!

98
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:25,796
All right, but not too early, all right?
We still gotta pack this shit up.

99
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:28,595
<i>Not much. All the computers
are gone. Most of the gear.</i>

100
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:32,832
Now, come on, Sarge.
It's my favorite holiday.

101
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:36,841
I even put on my very special,
sexy holiday boots.

102
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,934
Even though we're here,
I wanna do it right.

103
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:41,275
How could you possibly
do it wrong?

104
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:44,282
<i># We will conspire #</i>

105
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:48,252
<i>#As we dream by the fire #</i>

106
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:50,983
<i># To face unafraid #</i>

107
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:53,252
<i># The plans that we made #</i>

108
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:57,126
<i># Walkin' in a winter wonderland ##</i>

109
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:03,567
<i>Never take for
granted the greatest power of all...</i>

110
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:05,763
<i>the power to choose.</i>

111
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:09,934
<i>Consider the choices
you have made in the past.</i>

112
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:14,139
<i>And when they led you astray,
faith in times of opposition...</i>

113
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:16,875
<i>will lead to your salvation,</i>

114
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:20,680
<i>or often the easy way
will lead only to temptation.</i>

115
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:24,648
<i>Think of consequences...</i>

116
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:28,922
and cherish your power
to choose the righteous path.

117
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:33,455
You figure I'd be more liable
to tell the truth with God watchin'.

118
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:38,565
If you believe in God, Mr. Portnow.

119
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:42,699
You don't? I never met a brother
who didn't have faith.

120
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:47,310
I've stood in front of dozens of men...

121
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,315
who were all staring death in the face.

122
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:54,376
Every single one of them
begged for God's help.

123
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:58,914
After seeing all those pleas
go unanswered,

124
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:04,019
I... lost my faith.

125
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:09,968
So what's the what?

126
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:13,563
My answer... is this.

127
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,944
No.

128
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:25,707
I guess we're done here.

129
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:34,251
What'd you think? I was gonna let you walk outta
here with the crowd for protection? Get the fuck up.

130
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:37,784
<i>Walk in front of me.</i>

131
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:44,166
#Amazing grace #

132
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:49,037
<i>#How sweet the sound #</i>

133
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:53,704

00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:56,145
# Like me #

135
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:22,040
<i>Police.!</i>

136
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:44,795
Hold it right there!
Freeze, Bishop! Drop your weapon!

137
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:50,068
Drop it now, motherfucker!

138
00:12:53,305 --> 00:12:56,069
We're here at the new Precinct 21,

139
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:59,441
<i>where one of the city's most powerful
crime figures, Marion Bishop,</i>

<i>is being held in the alleged murder
of an undercover police officer.</i>

141
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:07,040
<i>Move back! Bishop, notorious
for his brutal execution methods,</i>

142

<i>in the Detroit area.</i>

00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,828
Bishop's crew.

145
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:31,069
Yeah?

146
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,784
Now is not the time.

147
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:41,786
I'm Lieutenant Holloway.

148
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:45,051
Marcus Duvall, Organized Crime
and Racketeering squad.

149

This is my team.
I know who you are.

150
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:50,385
Sorry about your man.
Where is this son of a bitch?

151
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:54,762
I don't spend one night,
not one night, inside,

152
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,768
and we both know why.

153
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,532
You do whatever you have to do
to get me out of here.

154
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:02,699
Do you understand?

155
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:06,176
That guy's a cop killer.

156
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:09,180
Judge hands down bail,

157
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:11,739
I swear to Christ I'll...

158
00:14:11,817 --> 00:14:14,650
<i>No arraignment 'cause of the holiday.</i>

159
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,212
Bishop spends two days inside
until he has a chance to make bail.

160
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:21,555
Don't worry, Cap. We got him.
We ain't gonna fuckin' let him go.

161
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,668
Happy New Year!

162
00:14:33,739 --> 00:14:35,969
Come on, man.
There's only three of us here.

163
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:39,408
Yeah, well, one of us is Irish.
My God, look at this thing.

164
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:43,938
It's gotta be older than me.
You'll never take me alive, G-man!

165
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:46,280
Look at this room.

166
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:50,413
Boy, there's gotta be evidence in here
from some of my first busts back in the day.

167
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:53,356
Uh, they got rid of all
the Civil War stuff. Oh, ho!

168
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:57,191
Hey, that's so funny.
Don't quit the day job, all right?

169
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:59,197
Sarge?
Yeah?

170
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:01,358
Friday appointment's here.

171
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:03,367
Are you kiddin' me?

172
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:06,131
Any feelings of anxiety lately?

173
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:10,869
<i>Yeah. Two words. The Lions.</i>

174
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:13,343
<i>They give me a lot of anxiety.</i>

175
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:17,212
<i>Please stop avoiding
my questions, Sergeant.</i>

176
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:19,274
Are you still taking
the painkillers?

177
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:21,876
Come on, Doc.

178
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:26,550
<i>I mean, even you have got to be getting
a little bored of these conversations.</i>

179
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:29,958
Why don't we talk
about the real reason...

180
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:33,294
<i>that you would come down here
on New Year's Eve...</i>

181
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:35,492
in the middle of this storm.

182
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:39,230
Okay. Uh, let's see.
We had an appointment.

183
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:44,538
I think the real reason...
is you're in love with me.

184
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,340
Huh. Interesting.
I can see it in your eyes.

185
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:49,813
That's why you come
wearing these fancy clothes.

186
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:52,146
It's very flattering,

187
00:15:52,217 --> 00:15:55,152
but I think you should stop
denying it, you know?

188
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,279
I hear... No, I hear you.
You're right. You're right.

189
00:15:57,356 --> 00:16:00,154
You're right.
My face obviously betrays me.

190
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:04,093
<i>I didn't get dressed up like this because I'm
going to a New Year's Eve party later tonight.</i>

191
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:08,998
Oh, no. No, Sergeant.
This was all for you.

192
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:12,003
A form of seduction.
Is it working?

193
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:14,005
Wonderfully.

194
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:17,042
<i>I'm glad.</i>

195
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:21,569
Okay, well, we'll have to finish
this conversation another time.

196
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:25,276
What is this thing
here? Hey, hey, hey, hey!

197
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:28,752
That's mine. All right, relax.
I don't care about the file.

198
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:32,951
So, uh, you got a desk job
at Precinct 21, I see.

199
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:35,892
You don't quit, do you?
How do you feel about it?

200
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:39,192
How do I feel about it?
It's no big change.

201
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:43,132
So I guess the new year's
not bringing anything different for you.

202
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:46,501
How's your leg, by the way?
I noticed you weren't limping anymore.

203
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:49,803
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It's just an observation.

204
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:52,776
Five years of undercover work,
and now this. Wow!

205
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,745
Good-bye.

206
00:16:54,813 --> 00:16:57,976
You must be itching to get back on
the streets. Good-bye. Happy New Year.

207
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:02,111
Happy New Year to you. I'll see you at the
new precinct. God, you know, I cannot wait.

208
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:05,622
I'd walk you out, you know,
but I just have so much...

209
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:08,956
I know the way. Thank you.
So much to do.

210
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:20,330
Jake, you should see this.

211
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:22,738
And now Lieutenant Marcus Duvall...

212
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:26,005
that's Officer Ray Portnow's superior...
is coming out of...

213
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:29,775
<i>Hey, that's Duvall.
Good cop. Good man.</i>

214
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:32,646
<i>Crime
kingpin Marion Bishop in custody.</i>

215
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,913
That man is in hell right now.

216
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:38,650
<i>...responsible for the slaying,
the fifth in Motor City this year alone.</i>

217
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,817
Hey, you okay, Jake?

218
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:46,292
Everybody in the bus.
You know what a bus looks like.

219
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:50,426
New Year's Eve in a house
of a thousand doors. How about that?

220
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:53,062
Huh? You'll be sittin'
in that cell of yours.

221
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:56,301
You're gonna want some "cham-pag-ne,"
and you're not gonna get any. No.

222
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:59,867
<i>No "Dick Clark's
Happy Rockin' New Year's Eve. "</i>

223
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:02,505
Losers.
I ain't no loser, baby, a'ight.

224
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:07,041
I'm just tryin' to exist 'cause my people lack the
power to consume what the media emphasizes in society.

225
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:10,213
So I'm forced to take shit that
ain't mine. Beck, your eyes are red.

226
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:13,554
You been snortin'? You been drinkin'? Your
eyes look glazed. You been eatin' doughnuts?

227
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,786
That's funny. Think
that's funny, motherfucker?

228
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:18,125
<i>What'd you read that in? A comic
book?</i>

229
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:20,131
Get in the fuckin' back.

230
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,039
Round 'em up!

231
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:49,287
<i># You're nobody
till somebody loves you #</i>

232
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:51,693
Well, we won't need that anymore.

233
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:58,062
All right, boys and girls.
We must raise our glasses in a toast.

234
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:02,005
A toast to this old shit-hole
before they tear it down.

235
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:04,269
I got a terrible feeling
I'm gonna miss this place.

236
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:07,107
Not as much as I'm gonna miss you
two. What are you talkin' about?

237
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:12,344
I have news, boys and girls.
Old school here is retiring.

238
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:14,408
You're kidding.
I'm packin' it in.

239
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:18,889
<i>- Just like this place.
- Congratulations, Jasper. Why didn't you tell us?</i>

240
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:23,519
I just got the word officially.
Anyway, here's to this old shit-hole.

241
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:25,620
Here's to me,
and here's to my new life.

242
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:28,427
Huh?
Cheers.

243
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,627
Cheers.
Cheers.

244
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:37,104
And now, little lady,
may I have this dance?

245
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,303
To celebrate
my retirement, huh?

246
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:42,074
Come on. Oh.

247
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:44,547
Don't go away.
Maybe you'll learn something.

248
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:47,676
#The world still is the same #

249

255
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:49,439
We never should've left in this shit.

256
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:54,042
Ah, shit. You mean their captain
didn't want these scumbags in there?

257
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:56,986
Wanted to give his men
more time off for the holiday.

258
00:20:57,055 --> 00:20:59,683
Marion Bishop. Marion Bishop.

259
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:02,784
<i>Chief, head cheddar
and whatnot, baby.</i>

260
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:07,059
You know, I heard... I heard about you
getting shot five times, man.

261
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:11,933
Five fuckin' times! What was it... your left shoulder,
your stomach, upper back, lower back, right hip?

262
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:14,939
Ain't that a bitch?
You didn't wanna die, though, right?

263
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:18,636
'Cause you're a persistent motherfucker.
You're like the black Rasputin and whatnot.

264
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:21,440
Serious, man.

265
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:25,540
Um, let me introduce myself.
My-My name is Beck.

266
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:30,384
I'm an entrepreneurial motherfucker
like yourself, slash lawyer, slash...

267
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:35,188
Got any openings, man?
Throw me a bone or somethin'?

268
00:21:42,267 --> 00:21:46,567
<i>Yo, pump the brakes! Don't slam 'em!</i>

269
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:50,005
- Shut the fuck up!
- Hey, Ray Charles! Slow this motherfucker down, man!

270
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:55,103
Officer Balls and Officer Cock.
Psst. Psst. Eye contact, man.

271
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:58,081
Eye contact. Let
me tell you somethin'.

272
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:01,745
The Constitution requires
that the state provide secure...

273
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:06,587
- Sit down. - Incarceration. I'm-I'm just
sayin' that I'm feelin' pretty fuckin' unsafe.

274
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:11,417
<i>- Shut the fuck up.
- Transport 1121, this is Dispatch.</i>

275
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:16,962
Transport 1121, Dispatch. Go.

276

<i>We're gonna have to reroute
you to Precinct 13 until the storm breaks.</i>

<i>No problem.
What's goin' on, Dispatch?</i>

278
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:25,876
<i>There was an injury accident
on the Parkway 101.</i>

279
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:29,209
<i>We're gettin' everyone off the road.
You'll stay at 13 until further orders.</i>

<i>They've already been advised.
Copy.</i>

281
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,943
Thirteen. What a piece of shit.

282
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,886
I don't care.
I'll be glad to get out of this.

283
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:57,107
Well, how about
this for a New Year's present?

284
00:22:57,175 --> 00:23:00,144
That scumbag Bishop
is hand-delivered to us!

285
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:04,342
- I'm gonna get some righteous payback from that skel for Ray Portnow.
- What are you doin' here?

286
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:08,910
What? I've heard so much about this
Bishop guy over the years. I wanna see him.

287
00:23:08,987 --> 00:23:11,922
I thought you gave up bad boys.
Get back inside.

288
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:15,323
It's not the new year yet, Sarge.

289
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,027
You must be Roenick. No offense, Officer,
but I'm pretty fuckin' perturbed about this.

290
00:23:26,104 --> 00:23:28,436
<i>We're closing down.
We're short-staffed.</i>

291
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:31,169
Central said we park here overnight
until the road's clear.

292
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,541
You got a problem with that, call in.
I tried. I'll give it another shot.

293
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:38,447
Jake, come on. You're not gonna send these
guys back out in that weather. Nah. Now, look.

294
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:40,644
We'll lock 'em up,
and we'll let 'em be. No problem.

295
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:42,778
All right, fine.
But they're your responsibility.

296
00:23:42,854 --> 00:23:45,618
I don't wanna hear jack shit
about them or from them.

297
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:48,659
<i>- Let's go inside.
- Bring 'em in.! Come on. Bring 'em in.!</i>

298
00:23:57,302 --> 00:23:59,236
Interesting cast.

299
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:01,169
Yeah, we got a female gangbanger...

300
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:04,208
<i>who swears she never
committed a crime in her life.</i>

301
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:08,144
This guy here specializes
in counterfeit merchandise.

302
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:11,705
<i>Need a fake Rolex, he's your man.</i>

303
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:15,150
Some junkie who robbed a deli.

304
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,654
- Allegedly.
- Allegedly.

305
00:24:17,722 --> 00:24:19,747
He's still ridin' on a high right now.

306
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:23,090
<i>And the star of the show.
He needs no intro.</i>

307
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:25,686
You know his credits.

308
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:31,266
<i>Sarge, when it rains, it snows.</i>

309
00:24:31,336 --> 00:24:33,327
Got another freakin' guest.

310
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:37,666
How's your car?

311
00:24:37,742 --> 00:24:41,838
Won't move. Must've walked
two miles in this damn weather.

312
00:24:41,913 --> 00:24:44,677
I'm soaking. Look at me.
Well, thank God you're not hurt.

313
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:47,240
So how did you enjoy your file?

314
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,344
Oh, yeah, yeah. You dropped this.

315
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:53,187
Oh, really? I dropped it? That's strange,
because I was sure that you took it.

316
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:55,692
Definitely dropped it.

317
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:00,564
That's disappointing.

318
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:03,362
<i>If you had stolen it,
it would've been the first time...</i>

319
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:06,063
you were taking a proactive
interest in your therapy.

320
00:25:06,137 --> 00:25:08,935
- You know it's a bunch of bullshit.
- So you read it.

321
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,939
Yeah, I fuckin' read it.

322
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:15,206
Did you steal it?

323
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,214
You know I stole it, all right?

324
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:19,546
And stop being so goddamn happy
about it, Dr. Sabian.

325
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:21,586
<i>It makes me sick.</i>

326
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:24,383
"I think he's hiding behind his injury.
He's not really hurt.

327
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:26,481
Jake Roenick no longer
considers himself a cop. "

328
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:29,391
<i>What kind of bullshit is that? Huh?</i>

329
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:31,622
You think I'm scared?
That's what it is, right?

330
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:34,096
If you'd read further on,
you would see that's not what I think.

331
00:25:34,165 --> 00:25:37,794
All right, well, then tell me what it is
that you think, Dr. Mrs. Mind-Fuck.

332
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,860
<i>What is it that
you think I'm hiding from?</i>

333
00:25:39,938 --> 00:25:43,465
I'm not gonna explain myself to you if
you're gonna act like a child. Excuse me.

334
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:48,070
Run away. We both know you can't handle
this shit, 'cause you want to fuck me.

335
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:55,014
Sergeant, if I wanted to fuck you,
it would've happened already.

336
00:25:55,086 --> 00:25:59,250
Gotta learn to control yourself, Doc. It's
affecting your work. It's very unprofessional.

337
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:02,191
Don't try to discredit me
because you're afraid I may be right.

338
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,693
<i>Right?
Yes.</i>

339
00:26:03,762 --> 00:26:06,526
About what? Come on. Tell me
what it is you think I'm hiding from,

340
00:26:06,598 --> 00:26:09,089
and then I'll tell you
whether I think you're right.

341
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:15,003
Okay! I believe that the prospect
of responsibility has rendered you impotent!

342
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,506
Impotent?
Yes!

343
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:19,100
And that's why you're working
at this old precinct behind a desk.

344
00:26:19,177 --> 00:26:22,112
I'm injured, all right?
That's why I'm here. Bullshit!

345
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:26,674
You feel responsible for the death of your team
eight months ago, and that's why you're here.

346
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:29,777
I didn't do anything wrong.
A board of inquiry cleared me.

347
00:26:29,854 --> 00:26:31,788
That's right.
You didn't do anything wrong.

348
00:26:31,856 --> 00:26:35,121
<i>But it was your decision that sent them
down the left hallway...</i>

349
00:26:35,193 --> 00:26:38,924
and not the right,
out the front door and not the back.

350
00:26:40,198 --> 00:26:43,463
And you don't want to make
decisions like that again.

351
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:47,972
Yeah. So? Maybe you're right.
What? You want a medal?

352
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:54,641
So now you're hiding
behind that desk.

353
00:26:54,713 --> 00:26:57,546
And behind that liquor
in your drawer...

354
00:26:57,616 --> 00:27:01,245
and those... pills
in that stupid little matchbox.

355
00:27:03,822 --> 00:27:06,518
But there's still one life you're
responsible for, no matter where you go.

356
00:27:06,591 --> 00:27:09,788
- Oh, let me guess. My own?
- Yeah, your own.

357
00:27:11,329 --> 00:27:15,766
And if you don't start taking care of yourself,
you're never gonna be the cop you used to be.

358
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:33,508
Bish.

359
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:40,758
Bish. Bishop.

Hi.

362
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:59,242
Yo, Bish, Bish. Just check it out.
Check it out, man.

363
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:02,108
Puerto Rican guy and a black guy
in a car. Who's drivin'?

364
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:06,142
The cops.

365
00:28:06,217 --> 00:28:09,380
You're killin'
me, man. You're killin' me.

366
00:28:09,454 --> 00:28:13,720
That was... That was...
We had somethin'.

367
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:16,090
Did you feel that?

368
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:19,487
All right.

369
00:28:19,564 --> 00:28:22,965
This jail shit ain't for Smiley.

370
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:25,628
This is definitely
out of Smiley's essence.

371
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:28,104
Who the fuck is Smiley?

372
00:28:28,173 --> 00:28:31,267
I'm Smiley. Me. I'm Smiley.

373
00:28:31,342 --> 00:28:34,004
Look, I'm facing a lot of jail time here.

374
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:37,207
I didn't do shit
to be up in this bitch.

375
00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:40,012
They lookin' for my sister,
and they picked me up.

376
00:28:40,085 --> 00:28:44,419
I ain't never committed a crime

386
00:29:19,457 --> 00:29:24,451
<i>For me it was I wanted this bicycle.
I was always prayin' for it, right?</i>

387
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:27,965
And God, in all his wisdom,
decided not to give it to me,

388
00:29:28,032 --> 00:29:31,661
so I stole it, and then I asked him
to forgive me after that.

00:29:31,736 --> 00:29:35,001
<i>But that was the beginning, man.

The threat is over!

444
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,343
You fuckin' kidding me, Sergeant?

445
00:34:08,646 --> 00:34:11,547
<i>I know. I know. Shh.
How's he doin; Iris?</i>

446
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:14,608
I'm sorry about your partner.
We just moved him to an office.

447
00:34:14,685 --> 00:34:17,245
Oh, shit.
He needs a doctor fast.

448
00:34:17,321 --> 00:34:19,812
Why wasn't there an alarm
on your back door?

449
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:24,191
<i>That alarm hasn't worked in months.
They're still out there.</i>

450
00:34:24,262 --> 00:34:27,561
Some kind of a truck out there
in the forest. It's not moving.

451
00:34:27,632 --> 00:34:32,501
<i>Are you kidding me? They must
have assumed we'd call for backup.</i>

452
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:36,028
I'm having a little problem here.
The phones aren't working.

453
00:34:36,107 --> 00:34:39,167
<i>Sure, they cut the wires. The
storm could've taken the phones out.</i>

454
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:42,576
Bullshit! Those are Bishop's guys
out there. They cut the wires.

455
00:34:42,647 --> 00:34:46,481
Just try the radios! Forget
it. Frequencies are blocked.

456
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:49,213
The frequencies are blocked?
That's not easy to do.

457
00:34:49,287 --> 00:34:52,654
Well, they must've got professional help,
because all the frequencies are blocked.

458
00:34:52,723 --> 00:34:55,191
They probably screwed up
your cell phones too.

459
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:57,227
I'm not getting a signal.

460
00:34:57,295 --> 00:35:00,355
Neither am I.
What the hell is this!

461
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:02,797
I told you!
They're Bishop's guys out there!

462
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:05,392
They're gonna break him outta here
one way or another.

463
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:08,462
<i>Maybe somebody heard the gunshots
and will come check it out.</i>

464
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:11,440
There's nothing out there but factories.
No, no. I don't buy any of that.

465
00:35:11,509 --> 00:35:13,909
They, whoever they are, are gone.
They're gonna think they're fireworks.

466
00:35:13,978 --> 00:35:17,641
<i>They don't give a shit about me, and I'm going! Thank you.</i>

467
00:35:17,715 --> 00:35:21,845
<i>Oh, my God. Oh, my God.</i>

468
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:26,356
What the hell is happening here? This is a fucking
police precinct, for God's sake! Jesus Christ!

469
00:35:26,424 --> 00:35:30,451
<i>Sarge, if you're all right,
you better take a look at this.</i>

470
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,265
<i>They're surrounding the place.</i>

471
00:35:39,337 --> 00:35:42,238
It's a goddamn siege.

472
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:45,036
I am not supposed to be here.
I am not supposed to be here.

473
00:35:45,109 --> 00:35:48,704
I am not supposed to be here.

474
00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:52,943
- Shit!
- Cease fire! Cease fire! Cease fire!

475
00:35:53,017 --> 00:35:57,044
<i>- It wasn't gunshots.
- Bishop.!</i>

476
00:35:57,121 --> 00:36:00,090
I told you. Those are
Bishop's troops out there.

477
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:02,456
<i>They're taking him outta here
tonight, no matter what.!</i>

478
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:05,018
This doesn't make any sense.
This is a police precinct!

479
00:36:05,096 --> 00:36:07,690
Shut the fuck up, Doc.
You said that already.

480
00:36:07,765 --> 00:36:10,495
All right, look.
Everybody just listen up.

481
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:14,197
Maybe they're trying
to give us a way out of this.

482
00:36:14,272 --> 00:36:17,366
<i>Let's just give them what they want.
Let 'em have Bishop, and it's all over.</i>

483
00:36:17,441 --> 00:36:20,638
<i>- Nobody else gets hurt.!
- Not a bad fuckin' idea.</i>

484
00:36:22,446 --> 00:36:26,780
No, we can't let that scumbag gangster,
a cop killer, walk out of our precinct!

485
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:29,718
<i>It's not an option! I'm
trying to defuse this situation.</i>

486
00:36:29,787 --> 00:36:33,052
- You got a wounded cop over there!
- I already said no!

487
00:36:33,124 --> 00:36:35,786
What in God's name
are we supposed to do then, Sergeant?

488
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:39,352
- They're gettin' ready to storm the fort.
- I don't think so, all right?

489
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:43,161
I think they're just tryin'
to scare us into giving up Bishop.

490
00:36:44,502 --> 00:36:47,130
They're doin' a damn good job.

491
00:36:58,983 --> 00:37:02,214
See, this blackout, this is the kind of shit
that deflates human smugness...

492
00:37:02,286 --> 00:37:05,278
about government's
so-called miraculous technologies.

493
00:37:05,356 --> 00:37:08,689
Doesn't it? Shove it up their
lyin' corporate fuckin' asses.

494
00:37:08,759 --> 00:37:12,559
This ain't no blackout, junkie.
Something suspect is goin' on.

495
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:15,258
I wanna know what the funk it is.

496
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:20,735
I know it hurts, but we
gotta get you away from these windows.

497
00:37:24,976 --> 00:37:27,536
Jasper, you got those flashlights?

498
00:37:27,612 --> 00:37:31,639
<i>I don't know where the fuck the are.!
Everything's been packed.! Roenick!</i>

499
00:37:31,716 --> 00:37:34,207
Get down! Get down!

500
00:37:34,285 --> 00:37:36,219
Jasper, get the blinds!

501
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:45,051
All right. All right.

502
00:37:45,129 --> 00:37:47,120
Yeah, we're perfectly safe now.

503
00:37:51,802 --> 00:37:54,100
These are just scare tactics, all right?

504
00:37:54,171 --> 00:37:57,402
They don't know how much firepower
we have or don't have.

505
00:37:57,475 --> 00:38:01,206
<i>They're not gonna come in here again.
It's too risky.</i>

506
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:05,306
What about us
gettin' out there, Sergeant?

507
00:38:05,383 --> 00:38:08,511
L-I need help real bad.

508
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,654
I need it.

509
00:38:24,101 --> 00:38:27,070
Let's barricade up
these doors and windows,

510
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:30,335
and I'll figure out
how to get some help in here.

511
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:49,589
What are you doing this for, Jake? Nobody
gives a shit anymore about anything.

512
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:53,255
We can end this right now. I can't
let a murderer walk out of here.

513
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:55,697
I can't do that.

514
00:38:55,766 --> 00:38:58,428
I'll get us out of this, Jasper.
I will. I promise.

515
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:02,199
You got almost no chance
out there, buddy.

516
00:39:02,273 --> 00:39:04,798
That cop in there dies if I don't try.

517
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:10,975
You keep the place locked down
until I get some help.

518
00:39:13,784 --> 00:39:15,718
All right.

519
00:39:15,786 --> 00:39:20,814
I'd better cover from the front windows.
I can see the truck better from there.

520
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,828
Keep your head down.

521
00:39:26,897 --> 00:39:29,161
Schmuck.

522
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:02,832
Oh, shit!

523
00:41:05,563 --> 00:41:09,021
<i>Oh, shit.!</i>

524
00:41:45,636 --> 00:41:48,036
I found this on our friend out there.

525
00:41:55,679 --> 00:42:00,309
Fuck it. Fact or fiction? You pulled
a guy's spine out once, didn't you?

526
00:42:00,384 --> 00:42:02,249
<i>Are you a surgeon?</i>

527
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:06,756
<i>I heard that bullet you took in your belly
is still lodged in there, rattling around.</i>

528
00:42:06,824 --> 00:42:11,124
<i>I bet you it's causing you a lot of
intestinal issues. Right? Right, man?</i>

529
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:16,762
<i>Bishop, I need to talk to you.</i>

530
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:23,139
So I just killed a man.

531
00:42:24,608 --> 00:42:28,567
His name was Danny Barbero.
A cop.

532
00:42:28,646 --> 00:42:32,742
A cop who works for Ray Portnow.

533
00:42:32,816 --> 00:42:34,750
The man you killed.

534
00:42:34,818 --> 00:42:39,517
<i>So tell me why cops are risking
their lives to get to you, Bishop.</i>

535
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:43,287
Why should I answer that question?

536
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:47,660
Because I'm thinking about sending you out to
the wolves and saving my own ass if you don't.

537
00:42:56,206 --> 00:42:59,141
I assume you know
who I am, Sergeant.

538
00:42:59,209 --> 00:43:00,972
You're a scumbag gangster.

539
00:43:01,045 --> 00:43:05,880
And one of my scumbag partners in crime
is your fellow officer, Marcus Duvall.

540
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:08,714
<i>Marcus Duvall and his entire team.</i>

541
00:43:08,786 --> 00:43:12,882
We used to split things 50-50.
Marcus got greedy. He wanted more.

542
00:43:12,957 --> 00:43:16,222
- So you killed Ray Portnow.
- After he tried to kill me.

543
00:43:16,293 --> 00:43:18,523
Mm. Right.

544
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:21,588
<i>They're here to execute me,
because if I make it to court,</i>

545
00:43:21,665 --> 00:43:25,863
every single one of them goes to jail
for the rest of their days.

546
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:28,370
How many cops
are involved in this?

547
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:32,239
I can't say exactly, but the blood money
runs through your entire department.

548
00:43:32,309 --> 00:43:36,803
I bet they're all here now, and they can't
allow me to leave this precinct alive.

549
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,077
They can't allow any of us
to leave here alive.

550
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:44,018
Now that we all know
it's them out there.

551
00:43:44,088 --> 00:43:46,022
Sarge.

552
00:43:47,257 --> 00:43:51,921
<i>Poor guy, he never had a chance.
Anyone know if he had any family?</i>

553
00:43:51,996 --> 00:43:54,988
<i>Someone's coming.!
Shit, someone's coming.!</i>

554
00:43:55,065 --> 00:43:57,863
- Someone's coming.
- Hit squad, Sergeant.

555
00:44:04,341 --> 00:44:06,935
They're here for all of us.

556
00:44:07,011 --> 00:44:11,846
Me?
All of us. You especially.

557
00:44:11,915 --> 00:44:14,748
<i>Fuck you, dealer.
This is all your fault.</i>

558
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:17,548
<i>Those are your brethren
out there, old man, not mine.</i>

559
00:44:17,621 --> 00:44:22,422
Don't compare me with your scumbag friends out there.
If it was up to me, I'd kick your ass out the door.

560
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:26,793
- I'd like to see you come try.
- Yeah, sure. You'd love to kill another cop today, wouldn't you?

561
00:44:26,864 --> 00:44:28,957
Only you.

562
00:44:29,033 --> 00:44:32,127
<i>They'll be coming on strong now.</i>

563
00:44:32,202 --> 00:44:35,035
Why? Why are cops
coming to kill us?

564
00:44:35,105 --> 00:44:39,132
They need to kill him
before he fingers them in court.

565
00:44:39,209 --> 00:44:43,236
They need to kill us too,
now that we know it's them.

566
00:44:43,313 --> 00:44:47,545
So... here's what we're gonna do.

567
00:44:47,618 --> 00:44:50,314
We're gonna take positions
all around the precinct,

568
00:44:50,387 --> 00:44:52,947
and we're gonna hold 'em off
until dawn.

569
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:55,958
Iris, Alex, you know
how to use a firearm?

570
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:57,960
No. No.

571
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:02,222
Why don't you give me
one of them guns, Sergeant.

572
00:45:02,299 --> 00:45:04,563
I'll help you fend off the black hats.

573
00:45:22,252 --> 00:45:26,484
Oh. Oh, shit. Men are here.
Good.

574
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:29,082
What a fuckin' mess this is.

575
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:31,753
I know.

576
00:45:31,829 --> 00:45:36,266
I'm lookin' at this as a matter
of simple mathematics.

577
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:39,427
If we walk
and those eight people survive,

578
00:45:39,503 --> 00:45:42,666
then 33 lives are destroyed.

579
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:47,942
The lives of my men
and their families.

580
00:45:48,011 --> 00:45:50,775
People I'm responsible for.

581
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:55,711
People I...

582
00:45:55,786 --> 00:45:58,687
People I love.

583
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:01,190
I don't see any other way, Marcus.

584
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:04,989
The blood trail leads right back to us.
We have no choice.

585
00:46:06,396 --> 00:46:08,455
If we go through this,

586
00:46:08,532 --> 00:46:12,992
we are gonna have to live with this
for the rest of our lives.

587
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:16,164
But you know something, Mike?

588
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:20,574
I could live with that
more than I could live with a cell mate.

589
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:25,240
<i>Once we step outside,</i>

590
00:46:25,315 --> 00:46:29,046
those people are no longer
civilians or cops.

591
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:34,352
We gotta put 'em all down.

592
00:46:34,424 --> 00:46:39,828
Without pause, without regard.

593
00:46:39,897 --> 00:46:45,563
1,024. 2,048.

594
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:48,901
Um, 4,096.

595
00:46:55,078 --> 00:46:57,842
Obsessive-compulsive disorder.

596
00:46:57,915 --> 00:47:01,874
The complex problems
force me to concentrate,

597
00:47:01,952 --> 00:47:05,547
neutralizing any feelings of fear
I have at a given moment.

598
00:47:07,524 --> 00:47:11,119
I hide behind its structure.

599
00:47:11,195 --> 00:47:13,959
You're gonna be all right, Doc.

600
00:47:14,031 --> 00:47:19,901
We don't know that.
Don't know that. You're so calm.

601
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:28,474
Thank you so much. Thanks.

602
00:47:31,815 --> 00:47:34,409
You don't have to do this.

603
00:47:34,484 --> 00:47:37,351
Yes, I do. I do.

604
00:47:37,421 --> 00:47:41,323
If I'm gonna die,
at least I should die gracefully.

605
00:47:45,629 --> 00:47:48,154
How are you keeping it together?

606
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:54,827
I just think about living.
I want to live,

607
00:47:54,905 --> 00:47:58,432
as opposed to
I don't want to die.

608
00:48:01,178 --> 00:48:05,706
That, and I keep telling myself
everybody's gonna make it this time.

609
00:48:07,417 --> 00:48:10,352
We both know what
could happen here, Sergeant.

610
00:48:23,934 --> 00:48:28,462
Safety off.
Yeah. Right.

611
00:49:01,705 --> 00:49:06,369
All right! Wake up!
Wake up! Wake up!

612
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:08,673
<i>- All right, already.
- Come on. Get up.</i>

613
00:49:08,745 --> 00:49:11,839
Oh, come on.

614
00:49:11,915 --> 00:49:15,544
Look, uh, here's the deal.

615
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:19,851
Those men that came in here...
they're still outside.

616
00:49:19,923 --> 00:49:24,860
<i>And... I have no idea
how many there are...</i>

617
00:49:24,928 --> 00:49:27,556
or what they're prepared to do.

618
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:31,192
Don't sweat it. There's nothin' you
can do. You can't stop Bishop's people.

619
00:49:31,268 --> 00:49:35,068
<i>Go ahead, Sergeant. Tell them.</i>

620
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:41,672
They're not Bishop's people.
They are police officers.

621
00:49:41,745 --> 00:49:47,081
What! "Po-po" popping each other?
This is the fuckingest shit I ever seen.

622
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:52,019
This ain't Smiley's fight, man.
Let Smiley go. Let me go.

623
00:49:52,089 --> 00:49:55,252
<i>I totally figured it out.</i>

624
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:58,317
Assassination politics, right?

625
00:49:58,395 --> 00:50:01,694
By the government-sanctioned thugs
abusing their authority again, man.

626
00:50:01,765 --> 00:50:05,394
Who's gonna save us from your
corrupt brethren, Sarge? You?

627
00:50:05,469 --> 00:50:07,460
You?

628
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:14,769
I'm gonna do my best to protect you.
All right? All of you.

629
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:17,245
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
I feel real safe, man.

630
00:51:20,177 --> 00:51:22,338
Fuck!

631
00:51:23,547 --> 00:51:24,946
Fuck!

632
00:51:45,869 --> 00:51:48,997
What the fuck is goin' on now?

633
00:52:10,994 --> 00:52:13,258
Get down!

634
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:18,597
Fuck!

635
00:52:23,507 --> 00:52:25,566
- Fuck!
- They blew out the fuckin' window!

636
00:52:27,444 --> 00:52:30,538
Cover the front.

637
00:52:30,614 --> 00:52:32,275
I'll be right back.

638
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:46,561
<i>- The window, Sergeant! The window!
- Look out.! Look out.!</i>

639
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:59,536
<i>- Shoot him again.! Shoot him again.!
- Shoot him.! He's not dead.!</i>

640
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:05,543
Man down. Denied entry.

641
00:53:19,829 --> 00:53:24,266
You gotta get us outta here, man. Smiley feels very
fuckin' unsafe. It's scary. I'm scared to death.

642
00:53:24,334 --> 00:53:27,929
You can't use us as fuckin' live bait.
Come on. Think about it. We're hostages.

643
00:53:28,004 --> 00:53:30,564
I know. They're gonna come
for us. Come on, man. Come on.

644
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:33,473
<i>- You can't do that. Think about it.
- Please. Come on, man.</i>

645
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:37,104
<i>- You can't leave us here as fuckin' animals to fuckin' die.!
- Smiley's scared shitless, man.</i>

646
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:41,241
<i>Please. We're sittin' ducks here.
Come on. Don't leave us like this, man.</i>

647
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:09,374
All right, choose a weapon.
Anything you see.

648
00:54:13,016 --> 00:54:16,611
<i>Tell me again why we should help
your little skinny white ass?</i>

649
00:54:16,686 --> 00:54:19,985
'Cause if you don't, you'll die.

650
00:54:26,196 --> 00:54:31,031
No resistance. Advancing
to the front door. We're going in.

651
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:35,060
<i>Spread out across the
precinct. Stop anything that approaches.</i>

652
00:54:35,138 --> 00:54:37,868
<i>- We might make it through this night.
- Christ Almighty. What are you doin'?</i>

653
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:42,708
- You can't trust these people.
- What the hell are you doin'? You're supposed to be coverin' the front. Goddamn it!

654
00:54:52,656 --> 00:54:57,320
Come on.

655
00:55:41,771 --> 00:55:44,035
430.

656
00:55:53,416 --> 00:55:55,884
<i>13,760.</i>

657
00:55:58,021 --> 00:56:02,788
All right. Just hold the front.
And don't move this time!

658
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:20,509
508.

659
00:56:41,765 --> 00:56:45,098
You fucker!

660
00:56:46,302 --> 00:56:51,638
You make me your defendant, you
son of a bitch! Make me set bail!

661
00:56:57,414 --> 00:57:02,010
- You all right?
- I feel better. I'm better.

662
00:57:15,565 --> 00:57:18,898
I got mine, baby.
Oh, yeah.

663
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:31,476
Oh, yeah.

664
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:37,245
Come on, you motherfuckers!
Come on! Run!

665
00:58:17,093 --> 00:58:20,187
Come on.

666
00:58:20,263 --> 00:58:24,791
Come on. Yeah.
There you go, secretary.

667
00:58:44,454 --> 00:58:46,513
Jesus Christ.

668
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:49,757
All right!
They're pullin' back!

669
00:58:49,826 --> 00:58:52,158
You all right?
He saved me.

670
00:58:52,228 --> 00:58:55,994
There's nobody out there in the front.
Them motherfuckers runnin' scared.

671
00:58:56,065 --> 00:58:59,626
All right. All right. I drove
'em back, baby. I drove 'em back.

672
00:58:59,702 --> 00:59:02,136
We're gonna have a red-raw revolution
on our hands, man. All right. Good job.

673
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:04,400
Good job. Good job.

674
00:59:04,474 --> 00:59:07,966
Maybe they'll leave for fucking good
now. They're not going anywhere.

675
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:10,535
- Put that goddamn weapon down.
- J...

676
00:59:10,613 --> 00:59:14,014
Old man, you do not
wanna point that weapon at me.

677
00:59:14,083 --> 00:59:17,177
<i>That is not a bright thing to do.</i>

678
00:59:17,253 --> 00:59:21,314
<i>Put that goddamn weapon down slowly, then back away from it, all of ya.!</i>

679
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:24,554
Jake, get their weapons.
Take their weapons.

680
00:59:24,627 --> 00:59:27,721
Ain't this a bitch. We saved your
asses. Now you wanna turn on us?

681
00:59:27,797 --> 00:59:31,528
Yeah, well, thank you for that, sweet
cheeks. Now, put your weapon down.

682
00:59:31,601 --> 00:59:35,230
The problem is outside, not inside.
Put the gun down, Jasper.

683
00:59:35,305 --> 00:59:37,865
<i>No, no. You know what the problem is?
That we criminals got rights, baby.</i>

684
00:59:37,941 --> 00:59:43,277
That's right. We got rights to be protected
against assault under any circumstances.

685
00:59:43,346 --> 00:59:46,907
- If you can't provide that, well, fuck you... we will.
- You're a fuckin' psycho.

686
00:59:46,983 --> 00:59:50,578
Jesus Christ, Jake! What? Are
you gonna trust these freaks?

687
00:59:50,653 --> 00:59:54,350
Huh? The first chance they get to blow our
brains out, they'll try to make a break for it.

688
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:57,154
<i>They need us as much
as we need them.</i>

689
00:59:57,226 --> 01:00:01,754
We all gotta start trusting each other right
now if we're gonna make it through this night.

690
01:00:01,831 --> 01:00:04,026
Put the gun down,
Jasper.

691
01:00:08,705 --> 01:00:11,105
Put the goddamn gun down!

692
01:00:25,822 --> 01:00:28,120
What?

693
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:42,128
<i>- Shit.
- All right. All right.</i>

694
01:00:42,205 --> 01:00:47,142
Now, let's all introduce ourselves to each other.
It's New Year's Eve. Let's turn over a new leaf.

695
01:00:49,879 --> 01:00:52,848
All right. Let's not
all fuckin' speak at once.

696
01:00:52,915 --> 01:00:57,477
The name's Smiley.
I'm a Libra, and...

697
01:00:57,553 --> 01:01:01,182
I'll handle these jokers.

698
01:01:01,257 --> 01:01:05,193
You handle your people,
maybe we get out of here tonight.

699
01:01:11,434 --> 01:01:14,028
He armed his prisoners.

700
01:01:14,103 --> 01:01:16,936
It's a smart play.

701
01:01:17,006 --> 01:01:20,100
Must be at least eight guns
in there now.

702
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:25,011
Just a couple hours till the sun's up.
If we can't breach, what do we do?

703
01:01:27,784 --> 01:01:30,116
Get the A.V. -5 here.
Are you sure about that?

704
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:32,984
Yep. I'm not takin'
any more chances.

705
01:01:33,056 --> 01:01:36,150
It's gonna take
a while in this weather.

706
01:01:36,225 --> 01:01:40,559
Marcus? What the fuck do we do
if it doesn't arrive in time?

707
01:01:40,630 --> 01:01:43,827
We'll have to think of some
other way of ending this.

708
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:48,796
You either flirting with me or clocking
my game 'cause you don't trust me.

709
01:01:48,871 --> 01:01:53,501
I don't like your beady little eyes all
over my goodies, so turn the fuck away.

710
01:01:55,812 --> 01:01:59,714
You're manipulative, weak knees
and that sexy copper complexion.

711
01:01:59,782 --> 01:02:02,979
You're definitely an Aries,
baby. You're pretty good.

712
01:02:03,052 --> 01:02:05,577
Smiley thanks you.

713
01:02:05,655 --> 01:02:08,852
<i>We got something in common,
you know that?</i>

714
01:02:08,925 --> 01:02:12,326
You comin' down
off some shit, ain't ya?

715
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:15,091
Don't be ashamed, man.
Don't be ashamed.

716
01:02:15,164 --> 01:02:17,325
What's your poison?

717
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:21,359
Seconal to bring me down.
Adderall to bring me back up.

718
01:02:21,437 --> 01:02:24,838
You gotta get up to get down.
Oh, yeah, baby. Oh, yeah.

719
01:02:24,907 --> 01:02:27,899
All right. That's enough.
Come on. Let's pay attention.

720
01:02:27,977 --> 01:02:31,174
I want a cigarette so bad.

721
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:34,944
Stupid New Year's resolutions.

722
01:02:35,952 --> 01:02:41,049
Hey, gangster,
you make any resolutions? Hmm?

723
01:02:41,124 --> 01:02:43,285
What do you think,
secretary?

724
01:02:46,362 --> 01:02:49,229
Oh, my God. I can't stop
thinking about sex.

725
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:55,460
<i>I mean, I usually think
about sex a lot, but this is crazy.</i>

726
01:02:55,538 --> 01:02:58,632
<i>Sex and death
are very closely related.</i>

727
01:02:58,708 --> 01:03:03,611
The Greeks called it Eros
and Thanatos... love and death.

728
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:08,241
<i>Or sex as a way
of nullifying thoughts of dying.</i>

729
01:03:08,317 --> 01:03:12,720
What's your deal, gangster?
You actually been shot five times?

730
01:03:20,062 --> 01:03:22,053
Six.

731
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:26,634
You really
pull a man's spine out?

732
01:03:26,702 --> 01:03:29,796
It was an Adam's apple.

733
01:03:32,708 --> 01:03:37,270
If you ever get
into tussles, secretary,

734
01:03:37,346 --> 01:03:41,009
you grab a man
by his throat, hmm?

735
01:03:41,083 --> 01:03:45,144
Dig it?
And then you squeeze.

736
01:03:47,223 --> 01:03:51,683
I guarantee you he will drop. He
will not get up for quite some time.

737
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:01,261
Oh, God. It's really quiet
out there now.

738
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:06,299
Yeah.

739
01:04:08,911 --> 01:04:11,903
That's what worries me.

740
01:04:13,482 --> 01:04:16,246
<i>We're not gonna make
it till morning. Marcus Duvall will not allow it.</i>

741
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:20,688
We've got eight people covering six entry
points. If we work together, we will make it.

742
01:04:20,756 --> 01:04:25,318
Look at it this way. That's me out there. You
think I'd let you survive until the morning?

743
01:04:25,394 --> 01:04:29,455
- We don't have a lot of options here.
- Well, we got to figure something,

744
01:04:29,532 --> 01:04:34,469
'cause I'm not gonna stay here all night
waitin' to get killed.

745
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:38,303
If you use the situation to try
and escape, it's about me and you,

746
01:04:38,374 --> 01:04:40,899
'cause when this is over,
you're goin' back to jail.

747
01:04:40,977 --> 01:04:43,741
- Relax, Sergeant.
- "Relax. "

748
01:04:43,813 --> 01:04:46,680
This ain't about me and you.
Not yet.

749
01:04:46,749 --> 01:04:50,185
- Our shit's on pause, huh?
- Yeah. Our shit's on pause.

750
01:04:52,121 --> 01:04:56,558
You saved my ass back there.
Why?

751
01:04:56,626 --> 01:04:59,424
Everyone in here
is my responsibility.

752
01:04:59,495 --> 01:05:02,157
It's my job.
That's noble.

753
01:05:02,231 --> 01:05:05,860
Unfortunately,
I don't share the sentiment.

754
01:05:05,935 --> 01:05:09,598
I see a cop in jeopardy,
he's on his own,

755
01:05:09,672 --> 01:05:12,732
unless it benefits me
to jump in for the save.

756
01:05:12,808 --> 01:05:16,107
<i>Listen. I don't try
to be anything I'm not.</i>

757
01:05:16,178 --> 01:05:18,373
That ain't gonna change;
I don't care what day it is.

758
01:05:18,447 --> 01:05:21,575
<i>You remember that,
Sergeant.</i>

759
01:05:21,651 --> 01:05:24,415
<i>Hey.! Someone's comin;</i>

760
01:05:33,195 --> 01:05:36,790
Oh, God.
It's Capra, Sarge!

761
01:05:36,866 --> 01:05:39,699
<i>You know this guy?
He's a cop. He works here.</i>

762
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:42,237
They'll execute him.

763
01:05:43,372 --> 01:05:45,932
- Capra!
- Shh!

764
01:05:52,548 --> 01:05:56,040
Yeah. Drive. Drive!

765
01:05:56,118 --> 01:05:59,417
<i>Oh, my God. He's gonna make it.
He still has to get by the sniper.</i>

766
01:05:59,488 --> 01:06:01,888
<i>Come on, Capra.!</i>

767
01:06:12,234 --> 01:06:15,601
He's still moving.
They didn't get him yet.

768
01:06:15,671 --> 01:06:17,662
<i>Where are you going?</i>

769
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:27,240
Come on. Come on.

770
01:06:29,185 --> 01:06:31,813
<i>Come on, Capra.! Come on.!</i>

771
01:06:36,225 --> 01:06:38,250
Come on!

772
01:06:42,932 --> 01:06:46,060
What the fuck is goin' on?

773
01:06:46,135 --> 01:06:48,831
Who's fuckin' shootin' at
us, Sarge?

774
01:06:50,339 --> 01:06:52,671
Who the fuck
are all these people?

775
01:06:52,742 --> 01:06:58,237
<i>What are you doin' here, Capra?
What are you doin’ here?</i>

776
01:06:58,314 --> 01:07:00,612
It's New Year's Eve.
I knew you'd be here alone.

777
01:07:00,683 --> 01:07:06,053
- I came to have a drink with Iris.
- You picked the wrong night to make your move, baby, believe me.

778
01:07:06,122 --> 01:07:08,386
You know, that's really sweet.

779
01:07:08,457 --> 01:07:12,188
That's really sweet, but, unfortunately,
I don't believe a fuckin' word of it.

780
01:07:13,396 --> 01:07:17,127
Put that goddamn weapon down,
you psycho! He works here!

781
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:19,724
I don't care that he fuckin' works
here, man. He could be a plant.

782
01:07:19,802 --> 01:07:23,397
<i>No, Jasper. Put the gun down, all right?
Let's not start that again, all right?</i>

783
01:07:23,472 --> 01:07:28,000
<i>He comes here in the guise of courting
that lady. It's a fuckin' ingenious plan.</i>

784
01:07:28,077 --> 01:07:31,513
They get one of their boys in here and then
take us out one by one by one. Come on. Tell 'em.

785
01:07:31,580 --> 01:07:34,014
They shot at him. All right? They
shot at him. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

786
01:07:34,083 --> 01:07:38,247
Oh, but they conveniently fuckin' missed,
didn't they? The act is a fuckin' charade!

787
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:39,685
<i>Come on. Tell 'em.
He's fuckin' right, Anna.</i>

788
01:07:39,755 --> 01:07:41,916
<i>Isn't it a fucking
charade? Do I have a gun?</i>

789
01:07:41,991 --> 01:07:44,824
<i>Do I have a fucking gun?
I can't hurt you.</i>

790
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:48,660
It's not fuckin' good enough, rat-bitch. Come on.
Just lock him up, man, so he doesn't do any damage.

791
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:52,360
<i>Come on. Come on, Roenick. Listen to
me, man. We're not lockin' this man up.</i>

792
01:07:52,435 --> 01:07:55,199
Not in my precinct, all right?
I vouch for him.

793
01:07:57,640 --> 01:08:02,339
Okay. Okay, I'm fuckin' sorry, but your
authority has been super-fuckin'-seded.

794
01:08:02,411 --> 01:08:05,574
<i>You understand?
You're not in charge anymore.</i>

795
01:08:05,648 --> 01:08:08,742
Right, Bish? Bish, tell 'em.

796
01:08:08,818 --> 01:08:11,912
<i>He could be one of them, man,
so fuckin' easily.</i>

797
01:08:11,987 --> 01:08:14,478
<i>You don't think we see right through
you? Fuckin' believe that shit?</i>

798
01:08:14,557 --> 01:08:18,926
<i>Comes in here playing that game,
playing stupid. You don't think we know?</i>

799
01:08:18,994 --> 01:08:21,861
Right, man?
Let's do the math.

800
01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:26,191
Let's put him away, man,
just play it safe, you know?

801
01:08:26,268 --> 01:08:30,705
Put it down. No, no, no. Come
on. Come on, man. Come on.

802
01:08:30,773 --> 01:08:33,537
Just do the math. Come on. Motherfucker
comes in like that, playing...

803
01:08:45,654 --> 01:08:50,591
Come here. Sergeant Roenick
is in charge. Understand?

804
01:08:55,397 --> 01:08:57,627
"Yes. "

805
01:08:58,667 --> 01:09:01,135
Let's go.

806
01:09:05,841 --> 01:09:11,370
Only because I respect you. But I still say this
shit is fuckin' illogical bullshit, all right?

807
01:09:11,447 --> 01:09:15,611
He may not be who he says he is. Just mull that
shit over. Think it over. Think it over, man.

808
01:09:21,223 --> 01:09:24,351
Iris, look after Capra,
fill him in on what's goin' on.

809
01:09:24,426 --> 01:09:27,657
All right, Capra? Just be cool
so no one else here gets spooked.

810
01:09:27,730 --> 01:09:31,689
Everybody else,
back to your positions.

811
01:09:39,508 --> 01:09:42,477
Thank you. Don't. That
was self-preservation.

812
01:09:42,545 --> 01:09:46,641
The more men we have,
the better chance we stand.

813
01:09:46,715 --> 01:09:51,015
Are you sure you vouch
for this man? I do.

814
01:09:52,454 --> 01:09:54,547
Come with me.

815
01:09:56,725 --> 01:10:01,128
You know, I hate to admit it, but Smiley
agrees with what you said back there.

816
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:04,325
Smiley want a fuckin' medal?
Hear me out, man.

817
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:07,563
Look, we're out of our shackles for what?
The last time in the next 15, 20 years?

818
01:10:07,636 --> 01:10:10,434
All right, man. Get to the point.
What do you want?

819
01:10:10,506 --> 01:10:13,737
Listen to me, man. Look out that
window. That's freedom, baby.

820
01:10:13,809 --> 01:10:16,869
<i>Get what I'm sayin'?</i>

821
01:10:16,946 --> 01:10:19,972
Look, maybe this New Year's can bring
something different for us after all.

822
01:10:20,049 --> 01:10:23,075
Beck like Smiley now.

823
01:10:23,152 --> 01:10:26,212
Eight months ago he loses
his team when a deal goes sour.

824
01:10:26,288 --> 01:10:28,222
Problem with drugs and alcohol
since the incident.

825
01:10:28,290 --> 01:10:34,058
Burned-out cop. Only a matter of
time before he drops his guard.

826
01:10:34,129 --> 01:10:38,498
Watch the truck.
They'll eye it as a way out.

827
01:10:38,567 --> 01:10:43,436
- What's the word on the A.V.?
- Storm's starting to let up, so it shouldn't be long now.

828
01:10:45,274 --> 01:10:47,401
Good.

829
01:10:52,982 --> 01:10:56,713
Someone gets inside,
takes off, goes for help.

830
01:10:56,785 --> 01:10:59,515
It's too obvious.
We'd need a distraction.

831
01:10:59,588 --> 01:11:02,318
We also need the keys. Your cop
said he dropped 'em in the snow.

832
01:11:02,391 --> 01:11:06,760
<i>- I could hot-wire a car. - I thought
you never committed a crime in your life?</i>

833
01:11:06,829 --> 01:11:09,627
- I haven't.
- Yeah.

834
01:11:09,698 --> 01:11:13,259
<i>Just picked up some shit
along the way. Whoa. Hold on.</i>

835
01:11:13,335 --> 01:11:19,069
How do we know she's not just gonna drive out of here and leave us
all here to die? Who the fuck are you, Miss Fuckin' Little Skirt?

836
01:11:19,141 --> 01:11:22,542
Shake that skinny ass
in somebody else's face.

837
01:11:22,611 --> 01:11:26,138
Okay, Anna. No offense, but I'll
feel better if somebody goes with you.

838
01:11:26,215 --> 01:11:31,482
Maybe I should go. I promise I'll
make her get help. Scout's Honor.

839
01:11:35,924 --> 01:11:38,757
<i>It's either me or Jasper.
Can't be.</i>

840
01:11:38,827 --> 01:11:41,762
We need your guns.
It's gotta be...

841
01:11:41,830 --> 01:11:44,060
<i>Me.</i>

842
01:11:46,769 --> 01:11:49,738
<i>- Me.
- You?</i>

843
01:11:54,143 --> 01:11:57,442
- Shoot.
- Hey, I'll go. I'll do it.

844
01:11:58,514 --> 01:12:01,972
<i>- What? It's the only thing that makes sense, right?
- Whatever.</i>

845
01:12:02,051 --> 01:12:04,485
Whatever the fuck ever.
Let's just do this. Come on.

846
01:12:04,553 --> 01:12:06,919
Me and... me and the doc.

847
01:12:06,989 --> 01:12:09,583
Fine. Okay.

848
01:12:09,658 --> 01:12:13,924
What? It's the right move,
Sergeant. I know that.

849
01:12:13,996 --> 01:12:16,260
All right. All right.
I'm the doctor, right?

850
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:18,266
Right. You can handle that? Yes.

851
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:20,529
You can?
I don't know. I don't know.

852
01:12:20,602 --> 01:12:24,971
But I have to try, okay?
No. No.

853
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:28,373
Please. I have to go.

854
01:12:28,444 --> 01:12:31,208
I have to do it.

855
01:12:35,250 --> 01:12:37,810
Shit!

856
01:12:42,691 --> 01:12:47,788
Hey! Those two skels are buggin' out,
just like I told you they would.

857
01:12:47,863 --> 01:12:51,731
<i>They torched the bus
for a diversion, I guess.</i>

858
01:12:53,635 --> 01:12:55,159
Come on!

859
01:12:59,441 --> 01:13:02,968
<i>- Aw, Jesus. They're gonna get themselves killed.
- They're dead already.</i>

860
01:13:06,982 --> 01:13:09,542
We can use this.

861
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:16,817
<i>Very smart.</i>

862
01:13:16,892 --> 01:13:20,919
They knew we'd expect them
to make for the car.

863
01:13:20,996 --> 01:13:22,759
Free life, baby! We
did it. Yeah. I told ya.

864
01:13:22,831 --> 01:13:26,733
Happy New Year. Now, how are we
gonna get the fuck out of here?

865
01:13:26,802 --> 01:13:30,363
Visual on two men. No shot.

866
01:13:31,573 --> 01:13:34,701
Moving to a better vantage.

867
01:13:41,984 --> 01:13:46,045
Hey. You sure
you wanna do this?

868
01:13:47,456 --> 01:13:50,016
Yeah.
All right.

869
01:13:56,598 --> 01:13:59,590
<i>Aw, shit!</i>

870
01:13:59,668 --> 01:14:01,568
- They're fucking shooting!
- Where'd they hit you, man?

871
01:14:01,637 --> 01:14:03,571
<i>My shoulder.</i>

872
01:14:03,639 --> 01:14:06,733
Let's go! Come on! Let's
haul ass now! Okay, okay.

873
01:14:06,809 --> 01:14:09,300
Go. Go.
You go.

874
01:14:23,859 --> 01:14:27,955
All right. Come on.
Come on, baby. Come on.

875
01:14:28,030 --> 01:14:31,158
This was not the plan, man!
This was your idea.

876
01:14:31,233 --> 01:14:34,225
Come on. We're so fucking close.
Come on. I think I can still make it.

877
01:14:34,303 --> 01:14:36,328
Come on, man. You can do it.

878
01:14:37,406 --> 01:14:41,069
<i>I'm on target.</i>

879
01:14:46,148 --> 01:14:50,482
Thirty-six, 45, 54, 63,
72, 81, 90, 99...

880
01:14:50,552 --> 01:14:53,953
Come on, man. What am I gonna
do? What am I gonna do, man?

881
01:14:54,022 --> 01:14:57,958
<i>- Don't make me go at this alone!
- Target two blocked.</i>

882
01:14:58,026 --> 01:15:03,464
- No shot.
- Have position but no shot.

883
01:15:03,532 --> 01:15:06,365
What the fuck's
up with that multiplication table shit?

884
01:15:06,435 --> 01:15:08,369
Fuck you!
It's freakin' me out.

885
01:15:08,437 --> 01:15:11,338
You couldn't hot-wire my
ass! You're a liar! Liar?

886
01:15:11,406 --> 01:15:13,431
I will bite your little white head
right the fuck off! Forty-five, 54,

887
01:15:13,509 --> 01:15:17,605
63, 72, 81, 90, 9, 18, 27, 36, 45...

888
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:21,547
What is taking so long?

889
01:15:21,617 --> 01:15:24,347
I'm gonna make it for you, man!
I'm gonna do this for you!

890
01:15:41,103 --> 01:15:44,539
<i>- - Seventy-two,
81, 90, 99... - Damn, motherfucker!</i>

891
01:15:44,606 --> 01:15:47,803
What did I tell y'all?

892
01:16:02,958 --> 01:16:06,394
What'd I tell you? You and your
sergeant boyfriend didn't believe me.

893
01:16:06,461 --> 01:16:10,522
- What?
- Sergeant boy. That's your boyfriend, right?

894
01:16:10,599 --> 01:16:13,568
- No.
- Yeah.

895
01:16:16,138 --> 01:16:18,902
They made it.
They're clear!

896
01:16:18,974 --> 01:16:21,875
<i>We made it.! We made it.!</i>

897
01:16:21,944 --> 01:16:25,209
Whoo!
Whoo!

898
01:17:01,683 --> 01:17:04,151
The skels are dead.

899
01:17:10,792 --> 01:17:13,693
We don't have a goddamn chance,
do we?

900
01:17:17,766 --> 01:17:22,965
<i>Sarge. Sarge. God-fucking-damn it,
the five of us can't hold them back.</i>

901
01:17:23,038 --> 01:17:28,032
They're gonna take out each and every one
of us. What are we supposed to do, Sarge?

902
01:17:29,878 --> 01:17:33,143
<i>What are we supposed to do?</i>

903
01:17:33,215 --> 01:17:36,184
What the fuck
are we supposed to do?

904
01:17:41,723 --> 01:17:44,385
I don't know.

905
01:18:06,014 --> 01:18:08,812
<i>What do you wanna
do, Marcus?</i>

906
01:18:13,522 --> 01:18:16,389
How many inside?

907
01:18:21,196 --> 01:18:23,721
Uh...

908
01:18:25,133 --> 01:18:27,124
A hundred.

909
01:18:31,239 --> 01:18:33,469
Answer the question.

910
01:18:46,188 --> 01:18:48,486
You're a brave woman.

911
01:19:00,035 --> 01:19:03,732
What do you want to do
with the body, Marcus?

912
01:19:03,805 --> 01:19:08,606
Bishop's men were responsible
for all this, remember?

913
01:19:10,746 --> 01:19:13,715
Let's get this thing done.

914
01:19:29,998 --> 01:19:32,432
<i>Time's up, Sergeant.</i>

915
01:19:32,501 --> 01:19:37,302
<i>Last stand.
Your gun would be appreciated.</i>

916
01:19:43,545 --> 01:19:46,139
Why did I let her go?

917
01:19:51,486 --> 01:19:55,217
I know a lot about dying,
Sergeant.

918
01:19:55,290 --> 01:19:57,952
There are two ways
you can handle it:

919
01:19:58,026 --> 01:20:01,621
With the self-pity or without it.

920
01:20:01,696 --> 01:20:05,894
Fuck you.
Get out of my office.

921
01:20:07,702 --> 01:20:12,571
I see you've made your decision.

922
01:20:57,986 --> 01:20:59,954
<i>Sun's almost up.</i>

923
01:21:00,021 --> 01:21:04,685
<i>Whatever Duvall's gonna do, he's gonna do
now. We need to get ready, or we'll be trapped.</i>

924
01:21:04,759 --> 01:21:07,785
Now, who the fuck asked you?

925
01:21:07,863 --> 01:21:11,060
You know, I've had all the shit
I'm gonna take from you, old man.

926
01:21:11,132 --> 01:21:14,727
- Hey, fuck you, dealer.
- No.

927
01:21:14,803 --> 01:21:17,169
Fuck with me.

928
01:21:17,239 --> 01:21:19,503
- I should've fucked with you...
- Enough!

929
01:21:20,642 --> 01:21:23,202
Bishop's right.

930
01:21:23,278 --> 01:21:26,406
<i>Jasper, you just watch the front here.
Iris, the cell block.</i>

931
01:21:26,481 --> 01:21:31,646
<i>Capra, you're on.
Take the back stairs.</i>

932
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:36,589
<i>Bishop and I'll roam,
coverin' all the other entrances.</i>

933
01:22:35,550 --> 01:22:37,609
Hey.

934
01:22:39,154 --> 01:22:43,989
What were you doing by the back door? What were
you doing? What the fuck are you talking about?

935
01:22:44,059 --> 01:22:49,019
I saw you. What did you tell 'em?
Why didn't you let 'em inside?

936
01:22:49,097 --> 01:22:52,066
Hmm? What's the plan? Aah!

937
01:22:52,133 --> 01:22:56,832
<i>- What's goin' on?
- You were wrong. He's workin' for Duvall.</i>

938
01:22:56,905 --> 01:23:00,898
He removed the handcuffs
from the back door.

939
01:23:00,976 --> 01:23:03,410
<i>What's the plan? Answer me.!</i>

940
01:23:03,478 --> 01:23:09,314
<i>Fuck.! I'm a fuckin' police officer.!
I don't have to fuckin' answer you.!</i>

941
01:23:09,384 --> 01:23:14,981
What's the plan, Officer?

942
01:23:17,892 --> 01:23:22,420
Oh, so it's about you and me now,
huh, Sergeant?

943
01:23:22,497 --> 01:23:25,523
<i>It's not about me and
you. Not yet.</i>

944
01:23:26,601 --> 01:23:29,866
<i>What were you doin' by the back
door, Capra? It wasn't me, Jake.</i>

945
01:23:29,938 --> 01:23:32,202
- What's the plan?
- I wasn't there.

946
01:23:32,273 --> 01:23:35,674
We let 'im live once.
He almost got us killed.

947
01:23:35,744 --> 01:23:38,770
We let him live twice,
we deserve to die.

948
01:23:40,682 --> 01:23:44,641
<i>You and I are friends, Jake. You gonna do this to me?</i>

949
01:23:44,719 --> 01:23:47,847
- What is the plan?
- There is no fucking plan!

950
01:23:47,922 --> 01:23:53,019
- Don't make me fucking kill you!
- What the fuck are you doin' to him? Listen! They're coming!

951
01:23:55,163 --> 01:23:58,655
<i>A. V. -5, getting
into position. Ten seconds to target.</i>

952
01:24:21,122 --> 01:24:25,388
- What the fuck are they doin' up there?
- What do you think?

953
01:24:38,073 --> 01:24:41,907
Save your ammo.

954
01:24:41,976 --> 01:24:45,241
<i>We don't know where they are.</i>

955
01:24:45,313 --> 01:24:47,577
We need to make a move
outside.

956
01:24:47,649 --> 01:24:52,609
- That's what they'd want us to do.
- Yeah. They'll pick us off, one by one.

957
01:24:54,856 --> 01:24:58,519
Jake, I found a way out!
Down in the basement.

958
01:24:58,593 --> 01:25:00,891
All right, Iris, Capra.

959
01:25:09,871 --> 01:25:12,499
All right. Go.

960
01:25:12,574 --> 01:25:15,566
Bishop, I need you.

961
01:25:29,357 --> 01:25:32,884
Come on. Come on.

962
01:27:02,417 --> 01:27:06,080
- It's an old sewer tunnel.
- Why didn't you mention it before?

963
01:27:06,154 --> 01:27:10,022
I didn't think of it.
We've been a little bit busy.

964
01:27:11,993 --> 01:27:17,556
<i>I don't even know where it goes.
Of course, we can always stay here.</i>

965
01:27:17,632 --> 01:27:19,361
<i>It doesn't
matter. Good job, Jasper.</i>

966
01:27:30,411 --> 01:27:35,508
Okay. We need to move.
Fire department'll be here soon.

967
01:27:57,639 --> 01:27:59,607
Here it is.

968
01:28:23,665 --> 01:28:27,328
All right. It's all clear.
Everybody up.

969
01:28:35,843 --> 01:28:38,243
Come on, Jasper.

970
01:28:47,388 --> 01:28:49,822
Thanks.

971
01:28:49,891 --> 01:28:53,292
<i>- Son of a bitch! Jake!
- All right. Now.</i>

972
01:28:53,361 --> 01:28:56,819
Me and the secretary are going bye-bye.
You don't follow, she don't get hurt.

973
01:28:56,898 --> 01:28:59,867
You lower your weapons, gentlemen,
we can end this on a happy note.

974
01:29:05,907 --> 01:29:09,843
My apologies, secretary.
Apology not fuckin' accepted.

975
01:29:09,911 --> 01:29:12,277
<i>Hold it right there.! Drop
your fuckin' weapons right now.!</i>

976
01:29:12,347 --> 01:29:17,546
<i>Down, motherfucker! Down! Goddamn it.!</i>

977
01:29:17,618 --> 01:29:19,848
Get down!

978
01:29:25,259 --> 01:29:28,387
<i>How the hell did they find us?</i>

979
01:29:45,413 --> 01:29:50,009
Oh, my God. It was Jasper at the back
door. You set us up, you motherfucker!

980
01:29:51,986 --> 01:29:55,513
You just killed us, Jasper.
Fuck you, Jake!

981
01:29:55,590 --> 01:30:00,550
Goddamn it. I told you, "Just let 'em have
the son of a bitch. Nobody else gets hurt. "

982
01:30:00,628 --> 01:30:04,530
'Cause I ain't dyin'
for that piece of shit!

983
01:30:08,002 --> 01:30:12,564
- Or for you either, Jake.
- I thought you were a cop.

984
01:30:15,676 --> 01:30:19,635
Go in the truck, Jas.
You don't need to see this.

985
01:30:24,018 --> 01:30:28,387
Bishop, you should've
taken that deal.

986
01:30:34,162 --> 01:30:37,495
These men aren't cops, Sergeant.
They're criminals.

987
01:30:37,565 --> 01:30:40,693
They're killers, just like me.
Ain't that right, old man?

988
01:30:42,770 --> 01:30:48,436
Yeah, that's right. That's right.
You're goddamn right, you son of a bitch!

989
01:30:48,509 --> 01:30:52,445
Not with your weapon.

990
01:30:59,954 --> 01:31:02,946
Give me a clean piece. Goddamn
it! Give me a clean piece!

991
01:31:03,024 --> 01:31:05,925
Close your eyes.

992
01:31:05,993 --> 01:31:09,588
Let him finish it.

993
01:31:09,664 --> 01:31:11,632
Oh!

994
01:31:11,699 --> 01:31:13,894
<i>Shit.! Get down.!</i>

995
01:31:19,207 --> 01:31:23,405
<i>The truck.! The truck.! The truck.!</i>

996
01:31:32,753 --> 01:31:35,187
<i>Go!</i>

997
01:31:45,099 --> 01:31:47,124
Get them!

998
01:32:53,100 --> 01:32:55,898
You
breathin'? Good. Okay.

999
01:32:59,507 --> 01:33:04,570
Oh, fuck. Fuck.
Just act like you're dead, okay?

1000
01:34:05,640 --> 01:34:09,167
Motherfucker!

1001
01:34:09,243 --> 01:34:11,803
Fuck you!

1002
01:34:16,484 --> 01:34:19,749
You fuckin' bitch!

1003
01:35:47,508 --> 01:35:50,033
Hello, Sergeant.

1004
01:35:50,111 --> 01:35:54,172
What the
hell are you still doin' here?

1005
01:35:54,248 --> 01:35:56,910
Marcus Duvall still lives.

1006
01:35:56,984 --> 01:35:59,612
For me, this is unacceptable.

1007
01:35:59,687 --> 01:36:03,248
So our shit's back on pause.
Is that it?

1008
01:36:06,794 --> 01:36:08,785
Yeah.

1009
01:36:11,999 --> 01:36:14,900
We have a problem.

1010
01:36:14,969 --> 01:36:18,769
Duvall and his men can see us.
We can't see them.

1011
01:36:23,611 --> 01:36:28,844
I'll draw their fire. Their muzzle
flashes will give away their position.

1012
01:36:31,185 --> 01:36:33,551
Don't miss, Bishop.

1013
01:36:33,621 --> 01:36:35,782
Run fast, Sergeant.

1014
01:37:10,424 --> 01:37:13,587
Call Roenick.
Who's Roenick?

1015
01:37:17,031 --> 01:37:19,693
<i>Hurts like a bitch, doesn't it?</i>

1016
01:37:19,767 --> 01:37:22,258
Call Roenick.
Tell him I'm dead.

1017
01:37:22,336 --> 01:37:26,705
You know me, Marcus.
I cannot tell a lie.

1018
01:37:28,909 --> 01:37:32,470
Look at you.

1019
01:37:32,546 --> 01:37:37,916
When I first approached you 10 years
ago, you couldn't look me in the eye.

1020
01:37:37,985 --> 01:37:41,045
One of them nervous,
God-fearin' types.

1021
01:37:41,121 --> 01:37:44,215
Now you put a bullet in me,
no hesitation.

1022
01:37:44,291 --> 01:37:47,124
You're quite the changed man
this New Year's, Marcus.

1023
01:37:48,462 --> 01:37:52,125
Now, for the last fucking
time, call him.

1024
01:37:52,199 --> 01:37:55,327
<i>He doesn't have to.
Drop your weapon.!</i>

1025
01:38:07,781 --> 01:38:10,181
- What are you waitin' for?
- Shut up!

1026
01:38:10,251 --> 01:38:13,812
- Put the gun down, Duvall.
- What are you gonna do? Shoot me?

1027
01:38:13,888 --> 01:38:18,825
- Arrest me? You gonna kill a cop?

1028
01:38:18,893 --> 01:38:22,488

- You didn't call my name.

1039
01:39:35,369 --> 01:39:39,601
That was self-preservation,
Sergeant, and it worked.

I told ya.
I'm not gonna change.

All right. Help me up.

Ow! Ow.

1054
01:40:49,276 --> 01:40:53,736
We have some questions for you, Sergeant.
I'd like to get this wound looked at first.

1055
01:40:54,815 --> 01:40:57,249
Anybody else out there?

1056
01:40:58,952 --> 01:41:03,685
No, man. There's nobody else.
Just me and... and them.

1057
01:41:03,757 --> 01:41:07,488

show up at the new precinct tomorrow?

Shit. This is fucking tempting.

1061
01:41:22,976 --> 01:41:25,911
No. Don't
break your resolution, huh?

1062
01:41:25,979 --> 01:41:28,812
Give me one.
I didn't make that promise.

1063
01:41:32,419 --> 01:41:36,378
You know, Sarge, I didn't
even recognize you tonight.

1064
01:41:36,457 --> 01:41:39,517
You were like a whole different
bad-ass motherfucker back there, huh?

1065
01:41:39,593 --> 01:41:42,426
Mm. You think so?
Yeah.
