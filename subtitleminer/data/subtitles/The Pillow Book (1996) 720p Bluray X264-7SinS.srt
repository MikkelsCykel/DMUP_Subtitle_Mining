1
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,235
It was on my fourth birthday...

2
00:08:15,302 --> 00:08:17,536
When my aunt was reading
Sei Shonagon...

3
00:08:17,604 --> 00:08:20,073
That I saw my father and
his publisher together...

4
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:22,341
For the first time.

5
00:08:22,408 --> 00:08:26,179
Though I'm certain that any clear
understanding of what I had witnessed...

6
00:08:26,247 --> 00:08:28,814
Would have to wait
until I was much older.

7
00:11:13,078 --> 00:11:15,011
on my sixth birthday...

8
00:11:15,079 --> 00:11:18,215
At the Matsuo Tiasha shrine
in Kyoto,

9
00:11:18,283 --> 00:11:20,217
Encouraged by my aunt,

10
00:11:20,285 --> 00:11:23,220
I vowed I would keep
a diary.

11
00:11:23,288 --> 00:11:25,322
A pillow book of my own.

12
00:11:37,134 --> 00:11:40,371
I would fill it with
all manner of observations,

13
00:11:40,439 --> 00:11:42,940
Just like Sei Shonagon.

14
00:11:43,007 --> 00:11:45,709
Perhaps one day, like her,

15
00:11:45,777 --> 00:11:48,644
I could fill it with accounts
of all my lovers.

16
00:14:18,528 --> 00:14:22,530
on the same day as I started
to keep my own pillow book,

17
00:14:22,598 --> 00:14:26,100
I met my future husband
for the first time.

18
00:14:26,167 --> 00:14:29,036
I was six.
He was ten.

19
00:14:29,104 --> 00:14:31,472
We did not exchange a word.

20
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:34,276
He had been handpicked
by my father's publisher.

21
00:15:00,835 --> 00:15:06,140
like Sei Shonagon, my sense
of smell was very strong.

22
00:15:06,207 --> 00:15:09,543
I enjoyed the smell of paper
of all kinds.

23
00:15:09,611 --> 00:15:13,113
It reminded me
of the scent of skin.

24
00:16:34,027 --> 00:16:36,796
my mother had
taught me mandarin.

25
00:16:36,864 --> 00:16:39,165
When my father painted
a Japanese greeting...

26
00:16:39,233 --> 00:16:41,800
On my face on my birthday,

27
00:16:41,868 --> 00:16:45,271
She played her favorite
Chinese record.

28
00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:49,576
It had been popular when my
parents had met in shanghai.

29
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:44,154
in remembrance of my father
and in memory of Sei Shonagon,

30
00:18:44,222 --> 00:18:46,724
I was determined to take lovers
who would remind me...

31
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,727
Of the pleasures
of calligraphy.

32
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:53,130
I could not be sure
which was more important-

33
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:56,667
An indifferent calligrapher
who was a good lover...

34
00:18:56,735 --> 00:19:00,538
Or an excellent lover who
was a poor calligrapher.

35
00:22:30,478 --> 00:22:32,480
I became a wife.

36
00:22:34,283 --> 00:22:36,618
I married.

37
00:22:36,686 --> 00:22:39,054
I acquired a husband.

38
00:22:40,022 --> 00:22:42,523
Whichever way you say it,

39
00:22:42,591 --> 00:22:45,326
It was bound to end badly.

40
00:22:47,763 --> 00:22:51,065
I had a ceremonial wedding
in style.

41
00:24:46,413 --> 00:24:49,015
separated from my parents
and my aunt,

42
00:24:49,083 --> 00:24:52,886
I confided in my own pillow book
more and more frequently.

43
00:24:54,588 --> 00:24:58,958
Like the pillow book of Sei
Shonagon, it was full of lists.

44
00:24:59,025 --> 00:25:02,328
Unlike Sei Shonagon,
all the lists were negative.

45
00:28:48,219 --> 00:28:50,553
that was the first fire.

46
00:28:50,621 --> 00:28:52,990
There was to be a second.

47
00:28:53,057 --> 00:28:55,825
Both fires marked
a big change in my life.

48
00:30:20,677 --> 00:30:23,811
when I first arrived
in Hong Kong, I hid.

49
00:30:23,879 --> 00:30:28,283
I lived in Kowloon city in the
cheapest rooming houses I could find.

50
00:30:28,351 --> 00:30:31,520
I did not want to be found
by my parents...

51
00:30:31,588 --> 00:30:33,555
Or by my husband.

52
00:30:42,798 --> 00:30:46,801
I tried hard to improve the
Chinese my mother had taught me.

53
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:59,314
In the meantime,
I was determined...

54
00:30:59,382 --> 00:31:01,883
To keep alive
my father's tradition.

55
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:07,455
I learned to type
on my 21st birthday,

56
00:31:07,523 --> 00:31:10,558
I tried to give myself
my father's blessing.

57
00:32:14,622 --> 00:32:17,691
I found work in the offices
of a Japanese designer.

58
00:32:21,997 --> 00:32:25,966
And I was determined to speak
English with an American accent.

59
00:32:27,068 --> 00:32:29,570
I was planning
to go to California.

60
00:32:33,575 --> 00:32:37,744
Twenty meter of pale
green organdy, pattern 14.

61
00:32:39,981 --> 00:32:42,316
A meter of type-b tulle.

62
00:32:45,052 --> 00:32:48,054
Uh, the small net size.

63
00:32:51,993 --> 00:32:54,628
The type-b tulle
with the small net size.

64
00:33:10,512 --> 00:33:13,747
we went to Kyoto,
back to japan,

65
00:33:13,814 --> 00:33:16,048
To work
in the Matuso Tiasha shrine,

66
00:33:16,116 --> 00:33:18,784
Which Sei Shonagon
had visited regularly.

67
00:33:21,021 --> 00:33:23,923
I couldn't give up
such an opportunity.

68
00:33:23,991 --> 00:33:27,461
I was also
a little homesick.

69
00:33:27,529 --> 00:33:31,064
We didn't finish walking
the catwalk until midnight...

70
00:33:31,132 --> 00:33:34,066
When all the audience
had gone.

71
00:33:34,134 --> 00:33:36,935
Sei Shonagon had watched
the moon rise in that garden...

72
00:33:37,003 --> 00:33:39,238
A thousand years ago.

73
00:33:39,306 --> 00:33:43,042
I could have walked up and down
that path all night long.

74
00:33:47,715 --> 00:33:50,683
you are not in a position
to preach clean living.

75
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:54,753
oh, yes, I am.
And in blood red.

76
00:33:54,821 --> 00:33:56,789
You could join us.

77
00:33:56,856 --> 00:33:59,758
I'm too beautiful...
And too rich.

78
00:33:59,826 --> 00:34:03,329
What's wealth got to do with
it? A great deal, I'd think.

79
00:34:03,397 --> 00:34:05,864
I design material.
You can wear it.

80
00:34:05,931 --> 00:34:07,900
Frighten the buyers.

81
00:34:07,967 --> 00:34:09,935
Then I'd soon
cease to be wealthy.

82
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:16,775
You wouldn't need to be paid.
You would do it for free.

83
00:34:16,843 --> 00:34:19,378
Oh, yeah?

84
00:34:19,446 --> 00:34:23,081
what else would you
do for free?

85
00:34:23,148 --> 00:34:25,983
I've been waiting to waste
my talent on your body...

86
00:34:26,051 --> 00:34:28,052
For a little reward.

87
00:34:29,956 --> 00:34:33,826
my search for the ideal
lover-calligrapher continued.

88
00:34:33,893 --> 00:34:38,231
But it was becoming less and
less likely that I would find him.

89
00:34:38,298 --> 00:34:41,199
If they were old, they were
invariably in no position...

90
00:34:41,267 --> 00:34:44,536
To take advantage
of what I had to offer.

91
00:34:44,604 --> 00:34:47,639
And if they were young, they
were often easily distracted.

92
00:34:59,218 --> 00:35:01,586
It's them!

93
00:35:15,167 --> 00:35:18,436
Don't look!
Don't look.

94
00:35:20,038 --> 00:35:22,641
What are you doing here?
Are you responsible for this?

95
00:35:22,708 --> 00:35:25,143
You shrimp!
What do you think you're doing?

96
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:27,178
Shut up!

97
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:20,365
they were children
playing a game.

98
00:36:22,568 --> 00:36:25,836
They used hoki, the Japanese
photographer from Tokyo,

99
00:36:25,903 --> 00:36:27,938
As a pawn to find me.

100
00:36:28,005 --> 00:36:29,973
I want those photos.

101
00:36:30,041 --> 00:36:33,877
I had once kissed him on the
cheek in a moment of happiness.

102
00:36:33,945 --> 00:36:36,814
You're a creep.
I'm sorry.

103
00:36:36,881 --> 00:36:40,384
I have watched you,
followed you everywhere.

104
00:36:40,452 --> 00:36:43,520
It's only too obvious.
And I could help you.

105
00:36:43,588 --> 00:36:48,359
Oh? You haven't done
too well so far.

106
00:36:48,426 --> 00:36:50,527
You are very beautiful.

107
00:37:14,285 --> 00:37:16,252
I employed a calligrapher...

108
00:37:16,319 --> 00:37:19,054
With an obsession
for mathematics.

109
00:37:19,122 --> 00:37:22,492
While his wife sang
and waited in the kitchen,

110
00:37:22,559 --> 00:37:26,329
This account clerk
filled my back with additions,

111
00:37:26,398 --> 00:37:28,866
My front with subtractions.

112
00:37:45,082 --> 00:37:47,618
I contacted
a magazine designer...

113
00:37:47,685 --> 00:37:51,954
Who insisted that I came back to
his apartment in the new territories,

114
00:37:52,022 --> 00:37:55,591
Where he could show me off to his
parents who wanted grandchildren.

115
00:37:56,927 --> 00:37:59,395
Write "dear Nagiko. "
what?

116
00:37:59,463 --> 00:38:02,364
I took risks.
Where?

117
00:38:02,433 --> 00:38:05,000
Here
I can't.

118
00:38:05,068 --> 00:38:08,905
Yes, you can. Who knows what casual
meeting would produce a surprise.

119
00:38:08,972 --> 00:38:12,174
Nagiko?

120
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:15,411
Some of the great
Japanese calligraphers...

121
00:38:15,479 --> 00:38:18,514
Were very modest
and unassuming men.

122
00:38:18,582 --> 00:38:22,852
Humble clerks by day,
daring poets by night.

123
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:28,424
Good. Now write
something else here.

124
00:38:37,501 --> 00:38:39,435
with great trepidation,

125
00:38:39,503 --> 00:38:42,571
I sought to move away
from what I knew best.

126
00:38:42,638 --> 00:38:46,007
After all, there were other
great calligraphic traditions.

127
00:38:59,088 --> 00:39:02,256
What have you written?
That's for you to find out.

128
00:39:02,324 --> 00:39:04,292
How am I
going to do that?

129
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:07,395
You know, some cultures
permit no images.

130
00:39:07,463 --> 00:39:10,599
Perhaps some cultures ought
to permit no visible text.

131
00:39:10,666 --> 00:39:13,503
I need writing.

132
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:16,170
Don't ask me why.
Just take out your pen and,

133
00:39:16,238 --> 00:39:18,974
Please, write your name
on my arm.

134
00:39:19,041 --> 00:39:21,175
Go on.

135
00:39:21,243 --> 00:39:24,579
I met an English translator
at the cafe typo.

136
00:39:24,647 --> 00:39:27,682
He said he spoke four languages,
including Yiddish.

137
00:39:52,007 --> 00:39:54,474
I'll give you
another chance.

138
00:39:55,645 --> 00:39:57,612
Write on my back.

139
00:39:59,882 --> 00:40:02,483
Well,
what shall I write?

140
00:40:02,552 --> 00:40:04,519
Write...

141
00:40:04,587 --> 00:40:07,454
"we met for the first time
at the cafe typo. "

142
00:40:07,522 --> 00:40:09,489
Write in three languages-

143
00:40:09,558 --> 00:40:12,593
Japanese, French
and English.

144
00:40:54,402 --> 00:40:56,670
Waitress!

145
00:41:09,117 --> 00:41:11,885
Are we going to do
more writing?

146
00:41:11,953 --> 00:41:14,354
Perhaps.

147
00:41:14,422 --> 00:41:17,090
You smell strange.

148
00:41:17,157 --> 00:41:20,093
Do you use perfume?

149
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,096
And your fingers.

150
00:41:22,163 --> 00:41:24,632
What's wrong
with my fingers?

151
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:29,103
I'll give you another chance.
The last one.

152
00:41:33,306 --> 00:41:36,943
Write on my breasts.
A little inappropriate.

153
00:41:37,011 --> 00:41:40,212
I'll decide what's
inappropriate.

154
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:43,249
Write in Yiddish.
What's Yiddish for "breasts"?

155
00:41:43,316 --> 00:41:46,286
If you're a writer, surely
you'd write on anything?

156
00:42:18,819 --> 00:42:21,888
This is not going to work.

157
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:26,391
You're not a writer.

158
00:42:26,458 --> 00:42:29,361
This is not writing;
it's scribbling.

159
00:42:29,429 --> 00:42:31,397
Distasteful scribbling.

160
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:35,968
Get out.

161
00:42:36,036 --> 00:42:39,505
You're not a writer;
you're a scribbler.

162
00:42:39,573 --> 00:42:42,874
I've watched you with your little
typewriter go click, click, clack.

163
00:42:42,942 --> 00:42:46,011
Get out. Go!

164
00:42:49,482 --> 00:42:52,318
You could show me.

165
00:42:52,385 --> 00:42:55,554
Go on.
No. I can't.

166
00:42:55,622 --> 00:42:58,223
How can I get pleasure
writing on you?

167
00:42:58,290 --> 00:43:00,558
You have to write on me.

168
00:43:00,626 --> 00:43:03,161
Go on.

169
00:43:06,565 --> 00:43:10,301
Use my body
like the pages of a book.

170
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:12,338
Of your book.

171
00:45:46,958 --> 00:45:49,658
not a special
writing instrument at all.

172
00:45:52,562 --> 00:45:54,463
I began very tentatively,

173
00:45:54,531 --> 00:45:59,402
Thinking of Sei Shonagon's
lists of anatomical comparisons.

174
00:45:59,469 --> 00:46:01,637
The thoughts were often hers,

175
00:46:01,705 --> 00:46:04,207
But the words
were entirely mine.

176
00:46:06,244 --> 00:46:10,113
For my first experiment
in using flesh as paper,

177
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:15,084
I made a deal with an Englishman who was
entirely ignorant of oriental languages.

178
00:46:23,627 --> 00:46:26,930
Hoki, this is where you can prove
you have my interests at heart.

179
00:46:26,997 --> 00:46:29,132
Come here quickly.

180
00:46:39,243 --> 00:46:42,411
off you go.
Beautiful photographs.

181
00:46:42,478 --> 00:46:45,314
And you don't get paid
because you owe me.

182
00:46:57,061 --> 00:47:00,562
This is where I begin
to do the writing.

183
00:47:00,629 --> 00:47:04,333
I'm now going to be the pen,
not just the paper.

184
00:47:54,984 --> 00:47:56,951
I could help you.

185
00:47:57,020 --> 00:47:59,254
I think not.

186
00:47:59,322 --> 00:48:02,690
Why not?
What's wrong with me?

187
00:48:02,758 --> 00:48:06,495
Because you are from Kyoto,
and you're young.

188
00:48:06,562 --> 00:48:09,830
And your handwriting
is illegible.

189
00:48:09,898 --> 00:48:14,601
Besides, your skin
does not make a good paper.

190
00:48:14,670 --> 00:48:16,671
Watch.

191
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:33,220
You see? In my diary,
I called you "the blotter. "

192
00:48:33,288 --> 00:48:35,256
Hoki the blotter.

193
00:48:42,364 --> 00:48:44,598
I could help you.

194
00:48:48,236 --> 00:48:50,538
I think not.

195
00:48:50,605 --> 00:48:52,573
Why not?

196
00:48:55,843 --> 00:48:58,345
You're none too smart
with compliments.

197
00:49:05,687 --> 00:49:07,654
let me try.

198
00:49:09,458 --> 00:49:11,425
Let me try.

199
00:50:20,027 --> 00:50:22,862
hoki set off at dawn for
a foreign language bookshop...

200
00:50:22,929 --> 00:50:26,832
In Kowloon city in a street
full of restaurants.

201
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:29,502
He finally gave the packet
to some doorman.

202
00:50:34,241 --> 00:50:37,009
"we feel that we are unable
to consider...

203
00:50:37,077 --> 00:50:40,012
"publication
of this material.

204
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:42,947
It's not worth the paper
it's written on. "

205
00:50:50,291 --> 00:50:53,125
So they're not satisfied
with the quality of the paper.

206
00:50:55,996 --> 00:50:58,463
Perhaps it's not
Japanese enough.

207
00:51:02,502 --> 00:51:04,703
Try writing on me.

208
00:51:13,046 --> 00:51:15,014
Seduce him.

209
00:54:17,027 --> 00:54:20,063
I met Jerome in the cafe typo...

210
00:54:20,130 --> 00:54:23,632
And asked him for the services
of a translator.

211
00:54:25,002 --> 00:54:27,536
He gave me a choice
of six languages.

212
00:54:27,604 --> 00:54:31,174
They had increased by two.

213
00:54:31,241 --> 00:54:34,343
I talked to him
and I flattered him,

214
00:54:34,411 --> 00:54:37,780
And I admired all the books
he had yet to write.

215
00:55:11,115 --> 00:55:13,883
you have to sign here.

216
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:20,455
our first transaction
was strictly financial.

217
00:55:20,522 --> 00:55:24,993
He wanted to pay the bill
but had no money.

218
00:55:25,061 --> 00:55:30,032
He offered to write a check
but had no checkbook.

219
00:55:31,735 --> 00:55:35,070
I volunteered the palm
of my hand.

220
00:56:30,025 --> 00:56:33,227
If I could not seduce
the publisher,

221
00:56:33,295 --> 00:56:39,067
Then perhaps I could seduce
the publisher's lover.

222
00:56:43,338 --> 00:56:45,539
His writing,
in so many languages,

223
00:56:45,606 --> 00:56:51,045
Made me a signpost pointing
east, west, north and south.

224
00:56:52,247 --> 00:56:55,482
I had shoes in German,
stockings in French,

225
00:56:55,550 --> 00:57:00,454
Gloves in Hebrew,
a hat with a veil in Italian.

226
00:57:00,521 --> 00:57:05,926
He only kept me naked where I was
most accustomed to wear clothes.

227
00:57:34,889 --> 00:57:39,125
Shut up.
Go away. Go away.

228
01:01:13,771 --> 01:01:18,576
I would like to honor my
father by becoming a writer.

229
01:01:21,379 --> 01:01:25,015
I could help.

230
01:01:38,662 --> 01:01:41,465
I could learn
new languages...

231
01:01:43,168 --> 01:01:45,936
To make you
understood...

232
01:01:47,205 --> 01:01:49,673
All over the world.

233
01:02:43,994 --> 01:02:49,031
When god made
his first human being-

234
01:02:49,099 --> 01:02:52,402
He painted in the eyes.

235
01:03:27,103 --> 01:03:30,005
And lips.

236
01:03:40,583 --> 01:03:43,084
And the sex.

237
01:03:58,468 --> 01:04:01,970
And when god approved
of his creation-

238
01:04:03,072 --> 01:04:05,907
He was obliged
to sign his name.

239
01:04:39,409 --> 01:04:43,611
There are so many publishers in
the world. Why worry about this one?

240
01:04:45,414 --> 01:04:47,915
I have my reasons.

241
01:04:49,818 --> 01:04:53,086
I suspect it's because
he rejected you so swiftly,

242
01:04:53,154 --> 01:04:55,424
And few people, if any,
have ever done that.

243
01:04:56,426 --> 01:04:58,427
Perhaps.

244
01:05:02,731 --> 01:05:06,867
But... If you're so determined
to be published by him,

245
01:05:06,935 --> 01:05:10,705
The publisher who rejects
you and who loves me...

246
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:14,809
Then I have a plan.

247
01:05:16,611 --> 01:05:20,681
I could be your messenger.
You could write on me.

248
01:05:20,749 --> 01:05:24,618
And with your permission and, of
course, your blessing, I could, um-

249
01:05:24,686 --> 01:05:27,488
Pay your publishing friend
a visit?

250
01:05:29,524 --> 01:05:31,692
A sacrifice?

251
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:33,960
But not without pleasure
for you?

252
01:05:34,027 --> 01:05:36,529
Perhaps.

253
01:05:36,597 --> 01:05:38,666
You could be jealous?

254
01:05:39,601 --> 01:05:41,502
Vtamo?

255
01:09:03,201 --> 01:09:06,136
It's worked. He won't
let me go. Wait for me.

256
01:09:06,204 --> 01:09:08,172
He's thinking
of an edition of 3,000...

257
01:09:08,239 --> 01:09:10,541
If there are more, and there
will be more, won't there?

258
01:09:10,609 --> 01:09:12,543
I'll see you this evening.
Wait for me here.

259
01:09:12,611 --> 01:09:15,547
Hey, you are enjoying
it too much.

260
01:09:15,615 --> 01:09:19,984
But with your permission. And only
according to the quality of the writing.

261
01:09:20,052 --> 01:09:24,188
If you don't hurry it along,
I'll be looking for someone else.

262
01:09:24,255 --> 01:09:26,223
You dare.

263
01:10:04,930 --> 01:10:07,665
He's making me wait.
buy some new paper.

264
01:10:07,733 --> 01:10:12,769
Don't get so upset.
you could use me.

265
01:10:12,837 --> 01:10:15,739
Give me two more of these and some
more of this and some stuff for him.

266
01:10:15,806 --> 01:10:18,842
You could have babies.

267
01:10:18,909 --> 01:10:23,748
They're not bad-looking ladies. I
need some skin, two meters and a half.

268
01:10:23,815 --> 01:10:25,849
Sorry?
Back and front.

269
01:10:25,916 --> 01:10:29,986
I could give you
three and a half.

270
01:10:30,054 --> 01:10:34,858
True, but the quality of the paper would
not attract my fastidious publisher.

271
01:10:35,559 --> 01:10:41,067
Jerome! Jerome.

272
01:10:46,203 --> 01:10:48,204
Jerome!

273
01:10:55,245 --> 01:10:57,413
Jerome!

274
01:10:59,515 --> 01:11:04,320
Jerome!

275
01:11:54,270 --> 01:11:57,472
I need you both.
Come with me?

276
01:11:57,540 --> 01:12:00,242
I really do.
It's like wild kingdom.

277
01:12:03,113 --> 01:12:05,347
All right, you're gonna like
this one. This one's funny.

278
01:12:05,414 --> 01:12:07,816
Okay. There are these two lesbians,
all right? And one says to the other-

279
01:13:35,203 --> 01:13:38,206
Oh, keep going. Keep
going. It felt good.

280
01:13:38,273 --> 01:13:40,274
It felt good,
I swear to god.

281
01:13:40,342 --> 01:13:43,544
You know something? If
you had a pair of tits-

282
01:13:43,611 --> 01:13:46,381
Hey, you know something? They
got a song about you in America.

283
01:13:46,448 --> 01:13:48,816
You know what it's called?
It's called "the hokey pokey. "

284
01:13:48,884 --> 01:13:51,985
You get it?
"the hokey pokey. "

285
01:13:52,053 --> 01:13:55,189
Ready? you put your right foot
in you put your right foot out

286
01:13:55,256 --> 01:13:58,059
your put your right foot in
and you shake it all about

287
01:13:58,126 --> 01:14:00,995
you do the hokey pokey. You turn your
- oh!

288
01:14:01,063 --> 01:14:03,164
Hello. Sorry.

289
01:14:03,232 --> 01:14:06,367
Americans always say
they have nothing to hide.

290
01:14:06,435 --> 01:14:08,669
I can see that's true.

291
01:14:08,736 --> 01:14:10,870
Look what I got here?
It is a menu.

292
01:14:10,938 --> 01:14:13,240
It's a menu to my very own
restaurant. So you come on in.

293
01:14:13,308 --> 01:14:17,377
No, get off! Come on in. And you've known
me a long time. I'll let you in free.

294
01:14:17,445 --> 01:14:19,447
Moo goo gai pan
and all that stuff.

295
01:14:19,515 --> 01:14:22,083
You wanna come in?

296
01:14:22,150 --> 01:14:26,119
How 'bout a little kiss? How 'bout you
kiss me in the hay? How does that sound?

297
01:14:26,187 --> 01:14:28,988
love me a long time, baby,
love me a long-

298
01:15:49,170 --> 01:15:52,772
Nagiko? C'est moi.
C'est Jerome.

299
01:15:52,839 --> 01:15:56,676
Nagiko?

300
01:15:56,743 --> 01:16:01,980
Nagiko!

301
01:16:02,048 --> 01:16:04,049
Nagiko-

302
01:16:06,119 --> 01:16:09,588
Nagiko! Nagiko!

303
01:16:09,656 --> 01:16:12,858
I know you're there!
Let me in!

304
01:16:12,926 --> 01:16:16,128
Don't play games!
I know you're there!

305
01:16:17,397 --> 01:16:20,833
Nagiko!

306
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:25,269
I met your friend.
I met your fat friend.

307
01:16:25,338 --> 01:16:27,806
He was nice, huh?
Was he nice?

308
01:16:27,873 --> 01:16:33,379
He was covered in my paint!
My paint for my body!

309
01:16:33,447 --> 01:16:37,450
Nagiko! Nagiko!

310
01:16:41,722 --> 01:16:45,357
Nagiko! Nagiko!

311
01:16:49,562 --> 01:16:53,065
Oh, my god! What have I
done? What have I done?

312
01:16:53,132 --> 01:16:55,668
I'll make it-
make it up!

313
01:16:59,072 --> 01:17:02,507
please let me in!

314
01:17:04,377 --> 01:17:06,978
I love you, Nagiko.

315
01:17:07,045 --> 01:17:09,748
I love you.
Talk to me.

316
01:17:11,149 --> 01:17:13,952
Nagiko!

317
01:17:14,020 --> 01:17:16,021
Please!

318
01:17:17,923 --> 01:17:20,124
I won't play games.

319
01:17:20,192 --> 01:17:23,060
let me in!
Let me in!

320
01:17:23,128 --> 01:17:25,029
let me in!

321
01:18:06,338 --> 01:18:08,806
Hoki, why won't
she talk to me?

322
01:18:08,873 --> 01:18:11,975
Nagiko, why won't she
talk to me? I don't know.

323
01:18:12,043 --> 01:18:13,944
What do you mean, you don't
know? Have you seen her?

324
01:18:14,011 --> 01:18:16,647
When did
you last see her?

325
01:18:28,827 --> 01:18:30,794
Oi.

326
01:18:36,668 --> 01:18:38,802
Whiskey.

327
01:18:38,870 --> 01:18:41,205
Uh, whiskey.

328
01:18:56,287 --> 01:19:01,657
She comes here, you know,
to pick up her clients.

329
01:19:01,725 --> 01:19:04,795
She almost lives here.

330
01:19:08,933 --> 01:19:12,669
The waiters are
all pimps.

331
01:19:33,090 --> 01:19:38,260
She makes sure
they are very smooth-skinned.

332
01:19:40,831 --> 01:19:43,533
You know?
Between the legs?

333
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:46,202
Her maid usually washes them...

334
01:19:46,270 --> 01:19:50,440
With lemon juice
to make their skin soft...

335
01:19:50,508 --> 01:19:52,608
And smooth.

336
01:19:54,611 --> 01:19:57,379
But you could scare her.

337
01:19:57,447 --> 01:19:59,615
You are a writer,

338
01:19:59,683 --> 01:20:04,486
Like in Romeo and Juliet.

339
01:20:07,358 --> 01:20:10,159
Shakespeare?

340
01:24:52,906 --> 01:24:57,109
Jerome? Jerome?
Jerome?

341
01:24:57,177 --> 01:25:00,011
Jerome? Jerome?
I'm sorry.

342
01:25:00,079 --> 01:25:02,580
We can start again
from where we left off.

343
01:25:02,648 --> 01:25:05,416
I was angry.
You deceived me...

344
01:25:05,484 --> 01:25:10,755
With a man I detest, with a
man who blackmailed my father.

345
01:25:10,823 --> 01:25:13,492
But... We can
revenge him.

346
01:25:13,560 --> 01:25:15,561
We need to work.

347
01:25:45,524 --> 01:25:47,525
Jerome.

348
01:25:49,061 --> 01:25:51,595
Jerome?

349
01:25:51,662 --> 01:25:55,733
Jerome! Jerome!
Jerome!

350
01:25:57,770 --> 01:25:59,771
Jerome!

351
01:28:38,562 --> 01:28:41,531
Jerome always wanted
to be foreign,

352
01:28:41,598 --> 01:28:44,966
Though not
necessarily oriental.

353
01:28:46,169 --> 01:28:48,403
English wasn't enough
for him.

354
01:28:48,471 --> 01:28:51,207
He'd never have made
a writer.

355
01:28:51,275 --> 01:28:53,376
He didn't have
enough imagination.

356
01:28:53,444 --> 01:28:56,446
Jerome was dyslexic
until he was 12,

357
01:28:56,513 --> 01:29:00,248
Before it became
fashionable.

358
01:29:00,316 --> 01:29:04,286
And he broke every pair
of glasses I gave him.

359
01:29:04,353 --> 01:29:07,055
He hated wearing glasses.

360
01:29:07,123 --> 01:29:10,125
He was very good
at breaking things,

361
01:29:10,193 --> 01:29:13,929
Especially relationships,
just like his father.

362
01:29:13,997 --> 01:29:19,734
His father was a catholic convert,
always experimenting with faith.

363
01:29:19,802 --> 01:29:23,238
We called our first son Paul
and our second Jerome...

364
01:29:23,306 --> 01:29:27,775
After his father's confessor,
who was a Jesuit in Singapore.

365
01:29:29,912 --> 01:29:32,615
Jerome never liked me.

366
01:29:32,682 --> 01:29:35,417
He preferred my sister,

367
01:29:35,485 --> 01:29:38,520
A little fool who was
excited by modern literature.

368
01:29:38,588 --> 01:29:43,992
All swear words and scatology,
before it became fashionable.

369
01:29:45,294 --> 01:29:47,962
I hear you're fashionable.

370
01:29:48,030 --> 01:29:51,566
I suppose that's
what excited Jerome.

371
01:30:03,779 --> 01:30:07,081
we burned an effigy
of Jerome’s car.

372
01:30:07,150 --> 01:30:10,217
We didn't burn his books.

373
01:30:10,285 --> 01:30:12,586
They were too damp.

374
01:31:15,550 --> 01:31:17,983
I burned my books...

375
01:31:18,051 --> 01:31:20,886
And my clothes
and shoes...

376
01:31:20,955 --> 01:31:24,558
And the photographs
and diaries.

377
01:31:24,626 --> 01:31:28,696
It was the second major fire
in my life.

378
01:31:28,763 --> 01:31:32,165
The first fire had taken me
out of japan.

379
01:31:32,234 --> 01:31:36,436
The second took me back.

380
01:35:37,541 --> 01:35:39,809
hoki wrote to me.

381
01:35:39,877 --> 01:35:44,014
Even after Jerome’s death,
he was still very, very jealous.

382
01:35:44,082 --> 01:35:48,586
He wrote to tell me about the
publisher's act of sacrilege.

383
01:35:48,653 --> 01:35:52,522
I had promised Jerome 13 books.

384
01:35:52,590 --> 01:35:55,758
I could not now write them
on Jerome’s body.

385
01:35:55,826 --> 01:35:59,428
I found substitutes in japan.

386
01:35:59,497 --> 01:36:02,465
I would write the books for
the publisher as a bargain...

387
01:36:02,533 --> 01:36:06,770
For the return of the pillow
book he had made of Jerome’s body.

388
01:36:12,710 --> 01:36:15,011
Now you've been signed by me,

389
01:36:15,078 --> 01:36:17,514
You can go and do my business.

390
01:39:27,235 --> 01:39:30,270
Excuse me. Can I see
the manager, please?

391
01:39:54,028 --> 01:39:56,529
Let's take
another photograph.

392
01:40:13,513 --> 01:40:16,950
Excuse me. Give it to the
manager and tell him we are here.

393
01:42:23,376 --> 01:42:25,344
Mm-hmm.

394
01:53:30,534 --> 01:53:34,137
this is the writing
of Nagiko Yujikino,

395
01:53:34,205 --> 01:53:36,538
And I know you
to have blackmailed,

396
01:53:36,605 --> 01:53:39,774
Violated and humiliated
my father.

397
01:53:39,843 --> 01:53:44,079
I suspect you also
of ruining my husband.

398
01:53:44,147 --> 01:53:47,482
You have now committed
the greatest crime.

399
01:53:47,550 --> 01:53:51,087
You have desecrated
the body of my lover.

400
01:53:51,155 --> 01:53:53,488
You and I now know...

401
01:53:53,556 --> 01:53:57,226
That you have lived
long enough.

402
01:56:17,198 --> 01:56:20,000
today, I am 28 years old.

403
01:56:20,067 --> 01:56:24,805
And on my 28th birthday
I have experiences enough...

404
01:56:24,873 --> 01:56:26,974
To write my own pillow book.

405
01:56:27,042 --> 01:56:29,075
Think of that.

406
01:56:38,486 --> 01:56:42,423
The pillow book
of Nagiko Kiyohara.

407
01:56:50,664 --> 01:56:53,033
I can now make my own list
of things...

408
01:56:53,100 --> 01:56:55,502
That make
the heart beat faster.
