1
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,840
lt's a big claim. Cops want to
nail the guy who stole it too.

2
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:43,040
We have to pay out $30,000.
To them, it's another heist.

3
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,520
Has the owner
stashed it someplace?

4
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,280
ls she trying to defraud us
out of a lot of money?

5
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,080
lf you have a large sums of cash
in the house,

6
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,080
we insist on certain alarm and
security alarms

7
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,520
which my supervisor has to approve.

8
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,840
But what we usually do is handle
the installation ourselves.

9
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,640
Sweetheart, can l get you?

10
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,120
John, do you have a minute?

11
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,480
-l haven't had lunch.
-What do you want?

12
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,760
Cherry cheesecake, prune Danish
and some Hershey bars.

13
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,600
And something sweet.
Some chocolate covered raisins.

14
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,800
-l found the missing Picasso.
-l don't believe it.

15
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:25,200
Galaxie Opticals. They rolled it up,
it's in a telescope.

16
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,840
How'd you figure it out?

17
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,880
lt wasn't easy.
l was looking for a picture

18
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,000
of a woman with a guitar,
but it's all little cubes.

19
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,560
Took me two hours to find the nose.
Better call the cops.

20
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,920
Right away.

21
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,400
Would you excuse me?

22
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,120
Rosie, get me the fingerprints
on the Leland claim.

23
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,720
-Who won the 6th at Aqueduct?
-Your horse came in 7th..

24
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,840
Never bet on a horse
with Parkinson's.

25
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,880
Congratulations.
l heard you recovered the Picasso.

26
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,040
-Yeah, congrats.
-lt was a breeze.

27
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,920
Here's something till
your order arrives.

28
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,680
You want to be my date tonight?

29
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,280
-What' tonight?
-George's birthday.

30
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,280
We're taking George out.

31
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,240
Sure. But you have to get me home
and in bed by midnight.

32
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,680
That's exactly what l was planning.

33
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,760
That girl has a body
that won't quit.

34
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,840
lt won't stop 5 minutes
for a coffee break.

35
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,560
Briggsie, l forgot to tell you...

36
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,480
Where are my... Rosie!
Where are my files?

37
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,400
-Where are my files?
-Moved.

38
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,480
They moved the files? Why?

39
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,800
Streamlining.

40
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,640
-This is Fitzgerald?
-Who else?

41
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,360
Did you take the files out
of my office?

42
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,640
-Can you come in like a human being?
-Did you move my files?

43
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:55,440
Or like an orangutan.
That would be a step up, too.

44
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,760
Put them back now. This instant.

45
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,800
You knew about the move.

46
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,080
Take my files and put them back
in my office now.

47
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,360
You had time
to move them yourself?

48
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,240
lf you were a man, l'd slam you
in the teeth.

49
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,320
lf l were a man, you'd be hiding
under the desk.

50
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,160
l gave you an order.

51
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,840
An order?
Who you think l am

52
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,880
some peroxide stenographer with brains
in her sweater who rear you pinch?

53
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,280
Pinch? l couldn't get
my arms around it.

54
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,400
l work for Magruder, not you.
We're turning this place around.

55
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,560
l've been working here twenty years.

56
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:34,120
You're here six months.
l'm not interested in your ideas.

57
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,000
Get my files and put them back now.

58
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,800
Or what?

59
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,960
''Or what?''

60
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,120
This is the question you ask me?

61
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,920
''Or what?''

62
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,760
Are you saying, ''or what?'' to me?

63
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,960
Get off my toe, or you'll sing
castrati with a glee club.

64
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,360
l hated you from the day you
set foot in this office.

65
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,000
You hate any woman who doesn't have
a double-digit l.Q.

66
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,760
l'm a good judge of character.
l hate you

67
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,560
and the chancellor of Germany with
the moustache but not in that order.

68
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:09,760
Don't let the door hit your back
and fracture the your pelvis.

69
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,920
You tell her who's boss?

70
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,320
How can she talk to me like that?
She thinks she's smarter

71
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,160
because she graduate from Vassar
and l went to driving school.

72
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,080
Does she know how many
cases l cracked?

73
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,080
Never trust a woman who whistles
for her own cabs.

74
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,720
Miss Fitzgerald?

75
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
ls that Miss Fitzgerald's lunch?

76
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,760
Sorry it's so late.

77
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,480
No problem.
Here, keep that.

78
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:40,400
This is Fitzgerald's lunch.
l'll deliver it to her.

79
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,280
You got to come
to some terms with her.

80
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:48,240
We don't need an efficiency expert.
The old man wouldn't have got one.

81
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,080
You were going to take her for
a drink to clear the air.

82
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,040
l did. l took her two weeks ago
to Rocky's Bar.

83
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,800
You and her at Rocky's Bar?

84
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,840
Sorry l'm late.

85
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,640
No problem.
lt's just and hour and fifteen.

86
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,400
My meeting ran long.

87
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,840
No, l understand.

88
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,560
We're getting rid of
that antiquated filing system.

89
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,440
l can find anything
l need.

90
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,960
l got a feel for where all
the stuff is in my office.

91
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,720
A central data file will be on
the 2nd floor. You'll get used to it.

92
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,200
What's wrong? You look flushed.

93
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,520
l'm just a little warm,
that's all.

94
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,160
You have all your
business meetings here?

95
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:43,280
lt's near the office.
Coat check girl's pretty.

96
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,320
-You don't like it?
-lt's fine.

97
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:49,040
lt gives new meaning to the word
''dive'' but it it's convenient.

98
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:53,960
l thought you'd like the thick smoke.
You don't need as much make up.

99
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,240
-What's the lady is having?
-Tequila.

100
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,480
So,...

101
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,760
Betty...

102
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,720
Betty Ann...

103
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,400
Can l call you...?

104
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:12,000
l can call you Miss Fitzgerald.
l have no problem with that.

105
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,800
l,... tell me about yourself.

106
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,120
Myself?

107
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,000
Your hopes,
your dreams.

108
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,760
Are you married? Obviously not
or it wouldn't be ''Miss Fitzgerald''.

109
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,960
Do you have a boyfriend?

110
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,200
ls this why you got me here?

111
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,880
l just,...

112
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,760
What's your life like?
Do you have any hobbies?

113
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,360
l have a meeting
in 1 5 minutes, so...

114
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,840
Your marital status is none
of my business.

115
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,400
Maybe it's a touchy point
with you.

116
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,920
You're possibly divorced
or widowed.

117
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,680
Maybe your husband committed
suicide. l could understand that.

118
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,880
Mr. Magruder hired me to streamline
the office. l'm going to.

119
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:01,520
But if something's not broken, l say,
why fix it?

120
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,880
There's a reason North Coast
has slipped from the top five.

121
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,560
There's enormous waste
and duplication.

122
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,240
Not in my department.

123
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,600
Any department can be run more
efficiently and economically.

124
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:16,520
Perhaps North Coast should eliminate
the investigative division

125
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,760
and farm out cases privately.

126
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,120
Would it be possible to
have a drink and discuss that?

127
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,200
We are having a drink.

128
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,000
You don't know what you're saying.
You came in here like a steamroller.

129
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,000
You felt threatened by me
the day l started.

130
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:43,240
l was l a challenge to your little
state-within-a-state...

131
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,520
and l'm not some wind-up doll
to tickle at the cooler.

132
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,720
l'm smarter than you.
l'm faster.

133
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,840
l see right through you.
You're right to feel threatened.

134
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,960
l am threatened by you?

135
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,560
lt's fascinating how many men
l meet with a fragile masculinity.

136
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,240
Fragile masculinity?

137
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,400
One more crack about
my religion and l'll...

138
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,920
l have to go.

139
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,600
Honey, let me level with you.

140
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,280
Despite all your highfalutin'
talk about streamlining

141
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,720
what you really need is
a good roll in the hay.

142
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,040
You wouldn't know
which end is up.

143
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,520
ln your case,
it would be hard to tell.

144
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,360
Don't see me out.
Someone may think we're together.

145
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,080
Do l look like
an organ grinder?

146
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,640
No. Just an organ.

147
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,280
Get used to her.
She's here to stay.

148
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,160
There's something about her
l don't trust. She's evil.

149
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:42,280
We have a reservation at the
Rainbow Room for George's 50th.

150
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,080
That'll be fun.

151
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:48,520
l don't have time to go home
to change. Does look okay?

152
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,880
No matter how bad the economy gets,
you'll never starve.

153
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,040
Good.

154
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,760
Wait. Miss Fitzgerald?
Okay, take a card.

155
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,680
You got to see this, Fitz.

156
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,160
That's the six of hearts.

157
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,600
That's amazing! How'd you do that?

158
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,760
-Magic.
-He could do it all afternoon.

159
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,280
l want you to teach me
one of those tricks.

160
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,520
Mr. Magruder, the report
will be done tomorrow.

161
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,600
You coming to George's birthday
celebration?

162
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,600
No. l'm up to my neck in work.

163
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,640
lt'll be fun.
George is a great guy.

164
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:27,560
Everyone here's nice. Only Briggs
gives me the dry heaves.

165
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,840
C.W? He's cracked
a lot of cases.

166
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,400
l don't see how. Such a drone.

167
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,640
Gets his tips from street contacts,
like ex-cons and blind beggars.

168
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,920
There's something about him
l don't trust.

169
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,160
-Any examples?
-Many.

170
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,840
He's smarmy, with those wisecracks
and double-meaning jokes.

171
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,560
l mean, who is he, really?

172
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,040
A shallow, skirt-chasing egomaniac
who's probably more lucky than good.

173
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,520
Sometimes it's better to be lucky.

174
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:59,040
You're being too rough on him.
He's just an insecure schnook.

175
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,440
He has no wife or family.

176
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,800
He was married. Short and stormy.
Picked a tramp.

177
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,120
That's a surprise.

178
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,720
Come tonight.
We'll get to be together.

179
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:15,000
lt's the perfect excuse,
an employee's birthday

180
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,160
How much longer will this go on?

181
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:21,040
Not much longer.
l'll be free by the end of year.

182
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,960
You love me, but spend all the
important holidays with her.

183
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:29,520
Life can get so complicated when
you think it's simple. Come tonight.

184
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,040
So we can eye each other and
play little games in code?

185
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,600
Yes. That's part of the romance.

186
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,160
We'll look back and know that...

187
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,640
when one of us brought up Paris,
it meant...

188
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,120
we are dying to make love.

189
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,120
You are such adolescent.

190
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,800
But cute?

191
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,040
Look at this.

192
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,320
Here's to George Bond,
insurance man, father.

193
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,760
Amateur magician.

194
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,080
George, no card tricks tonight.

195
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,280
Happy fiftieth, George.

196
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,880
Everyone, l'd like to make
a toast to C.W. Briggs.

197
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,280
Thanks to you, the police now
have the stolen Picasso.

198
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,000
What made you think of looking
in the telescope?

199
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,920
What l do is put myself
in the criminal's position.

200
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:36,880
l try to anticipate what
he'll do next. l think like him.

201
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,400
Fantastic.

202
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,880
l would hate to have me
after me.

203
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,440
What are you thinking, Mr. Magruder?
You look lost in reverie.

204
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:52,760
Sorry. l was just reading about
the Germans occupying Paris.

205
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,280
Doesn't look good.

206
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,440
-C.W., ever been to Paris?
-l've never been out of the country.

207
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,600
Six-zero-dash-six...

208
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,760
eight-dash-five...

209
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,920
eight-five-seven.

210
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,920
That's right.
That's exactly correct.

211
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:13,800
And now for something l call
''The Power of Jade Scorpion''.

212
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:18,160
For this, l'll need some victims,
l mean, volunteers from the audience.

213
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,560
A few nice people.
Miss, would you?

214
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,040
Sir?

215
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:30,040
-Here's another one!
-There's a sucker born every minute!

216
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,600
Represent us well, Briggs!

217
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,200
Many years ago...

218
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,560
an emperor in China received
as a gift this precious pendant.

219
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,080
A Jade Scorpion.

220
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:47,600
lt was said to possess extraordinary
powers to darken men's minds.

221
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,440
l can't get hypnotized.
l'm a bad subject.

222
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,800
Eyes only on the Scorpion, please.
Ears open...

223
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:58,120
to the sound of my voice.
Look at the Scorpion.

224
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,080
The surrender of the mind.

225
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,960
The surrender of the mind.

226
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,600
They resist and resist.

227
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,920
But the Scorpion
likes resistance.

228
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,520
What is your name, sir?

229
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,640
C.W. Briggs.

230
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,440
And what do you do, Mr. Briggs?

231
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,000
l'm an insurance investigator

232
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,800
for North Coast Casualty and
Fidelity of New York.

233
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,000
What is your name, miss?

234
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:33,200
Betty Ann Fitzgerald.
l also work at North Coast.

235
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,200
So you work together?

236
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,040
l can't stand her.

237
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,960
Don't pay attention to him.

238
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,640
He's a sleazy megalomaniac who's
frightened of women.

239
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,440
Enough. Sleep.

240
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,160
Silence.

241
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:53,320
The Jade Scorpion wants
you to go to the deepest level.

242
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:58,880
When l say ''Constantinople'', you'll
drop into the deepest trance.

243
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,040
All resistance will disappear.

244
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,360
When l say ''Madagascar'',

245
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,800
you will go to the deepest level
of hypnotic sleep.

246
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,560
You will obey all my orders.
Ready.

247
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,000
Constantinople. Madagascar.

248
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,920
C.W. Briggs,

249
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:22,280
Miss Betty Ann Fitzgerald,
l now pronounce you man and wife.

250
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,960
When l snap my fingers you'll awaken,
not knowing you're in a trance.

251
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,520
You will be madly in love
with each other.

252
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,120
You're on your honeymoon
on a desert island.

253
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,520
Maestro?

254
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,400
The moon shines down
its magical glow

255
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,920
on you two honeymooners.
You're deeply in love.

256
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,000
Ready?

257
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:48,480
One, two, three. Awaken
to your tropical paradise.

258
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,960
What are you thinking?

259
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,800
l'm thinking

260
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,840
l'm the luckiest man
in the world

261
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,920
to have you.

262
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,640
l'm the lucky one, C.W.

263
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,680
l was in love with you
the first moment l saw you.

264
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,800
Make love to me here

265
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,360
under the stars, to the sound
of the ocean.

266
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,840
Miss Fitzgerald.

267
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:23,400
You're making a mistake.
l'm not longer Miss Fitzgerald.

268
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,800
l'm Mrs. C.W. Briggs.

269
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,560
Betty Ann!

270
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,840
Make love here to me here. Now.

271
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,360
Stop. Enough.

272
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:37,360
Unfortunately, every dream must
turn to reality.

273
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:42,120
When l snap my fingers, you'll awaken
with no memory of this event.

274
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:46,600
You'll return to your regular lives,
with whatever destinies await you.

275
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,600
l hope they are pleasant ones.

276
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,400
Ready?
On the snap of my fingers.

277
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,640
One, you're beginning to come up.
Two, the memory is fading completely.

278
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:00,440
Three, the Jade Scorpion has created
the miracle of love.

279
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,400
And four, awaken.

280
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,600
How do you feel?

281
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,080
Waiting for something to happen.

282
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,760
How do you feel?

283
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,680
l'm not very good subject.

284
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,240
Me, neither. l told you wouldn't work.

285
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,560
Well, l tried my best.

286
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,200
George, back me. You gazed into
her eyes and said you loved her.

287
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,440
You're crazy. Never. lt's a
conspiracy to make me look crazy.

288
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,080
l hope someone talks to me
like that someday.

289
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,440
l can't bear Fitzgerald.

290
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,480
Speaking of that

291
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,120
shouldn't we be getting home
to feed your cat?

292
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:42,560
l'm getting a cold. l want to
go to bed with some tea.

293
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,120
lf you got a cold, someone has to
rub your chest with Vicks.

294
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,640
Anyone rubs my chest,
better bring a ring.

295
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,000
Good for you.

296
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,720
Good night, baby.

297
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,560
l knew we'd get some
time alone if you came.

298
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,920
l'm glad l came.

299
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,160
Hello?

300
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,160
Constantinople.

301
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,040
<i>You are
in a deep trance.</i>

302
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,960
<i>You will fall deeper
under the sway of my words.</i>

303
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:06,160
You will obey my instructions
carefully.

304
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:10,680
You will go to the Kensington
estate, where you will obtain

305
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,520
all the jewels
from the safe.

306
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,280
With the utmost secrecy,

307
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,960
you will use all the information and
techniques at your command.

308
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,680
You will do it with
ease and facility.

309
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,680
Then you will return to
your apartment, with the jewels.

310
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,080
You'll hide them in a safe and
secure hiding place,

311
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,040
awaiting further instructions
from me.

312
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,880
You'll then fall into a deep slumber
and awake refreshed

313
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,720
without no memory
of what has occurred.

314
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,160
You will wait to hear from me.

315
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:47,200
Your life will be as your life is,
until you hear from me.

316
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,400
Obey my instructions
to the letter.

317
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:55,280
You'll remember nothing that occurred
under trance. ls that clear to you?

318
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,800
Very clear.

319
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,720
<i>Go. the Jade Scorpion
commands it.</i>

320
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,920
Awful late, Mr. Briggs.
Hot on a case?

321
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,600
The Kensington safe
was broken into.

322
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,920
Jewels worth millions,
all gone.

323
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:12,120
Cops haven't a clue.
Magruder is numb.

324
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:16,000
l don't understand, l burglar-
proofed that placed myself.

325
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,640
Tell that to the perpetrator.

326
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:22,720
We're on the hook for big money,
so get over there fast.

327
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,400
Those stones could be on the market
in Tangier or Cairo.

328
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:33,000
Everything, my emerald tiara,
my sapphire necklace from lndia.

329
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,360
That sapphire is the most perfect
in the world.

330
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,840
No fingerprints,
but a partial shoe print.

331
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,080
-Man or woman?
-l can't be sure.

332
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:44,720
l want to interview everybody,
butlers, gardeners, everybody.

333
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:49,040
l think your gut reaction
is betraying you, C.W.

334
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:52,200
Nobody in this house is involved.
l'd bet my life.

335
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,520
l want to search.
Can l go upstairs?

336
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:58,840
lf you must, be fast. We've had
enough excitement for one day.

337
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,520
Mrs. Kensington? You know
Alfie and l would never...

338
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,560
Lotte, of course not.

339
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,760
What are you doing
in my mother's closet?

340
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,520
Well, hello.

341
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,880
You're one of those grubby
private detectives, aren't you?

342
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:30,840
A private eye, they're called.
A shamus. A gumshoe.

343
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,200
No, l'm a grubby
insurance investigator.

344
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,680
Private eyes are romantic.
l'm just grubby.

345
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,720
You always get your kicks
fondling women's shoes?

346
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,960
No, once in a while l'll fondle
a whole woman.

347
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,560
You have a fresh mouth.
l'm not sure l like you.

348
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:51,280
l grow on people. We could meet
later, and l could grow on you.

349
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,240
You don't seem tough enough
to go after criminals.

350
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:57,120
Maybe if l slap you around,
you'll change your mind.

351
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,720
l could slap you back.

352
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,840
This is starting to sound like fun.
Shall we put some music on?

353
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,400
Why are you snooping around?

354
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,840
You're Laura Kensington, right?

355
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,680
That's right.

356
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:12,360
And l have a strawberry mark on
my thigh to prove it. Want to see?

357
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:15,080
Maybe later, when l can take
the full tour.

358
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,080
My fiancé
might not appreciate that.

359
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,320
Which one?

360
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,160
So you follow my life.

361
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,520
l read the tabloids.

362
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,640
You've seen photos of me
diving into a public fountain.

363
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,560
And getting arrested for speeding
and throwing champagne at El Morocco.

364
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:36,400
While l live the fast life,
you snoop in people's closets.

365
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,120
Can l help it
if l'm paid by the clue?

366
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:43,640
-Did the burglar leave any?
-No. Because he's still among us.

367
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,480
-Says who?
-The little man who lives inside me.

368
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,200
So you're C.W. Briggs.

369
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:55,400
l hear you're a sharp investigator
with an impressive record.

370
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,600
l looked forward to meeting you.

371
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,520
They say l always get my man.

372
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,520
Me, too.

373
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,120
Right.

374
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:10,040
l'm glad we could have this chat.
Too bad the house is full of people.

375
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,000
Where shall we go tonight?

376
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,960
Chinatown or Harlem?
You prefer jazz or opium?

377
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,000
l prefer the rug
in front of my fireplace.

378
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:25,160
Directly to your apartment?
You always begin with the dessert?

379
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,440
lt depends what l'm eating.

380
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:33,040
This will be
an interesting experiment.

381
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:37,400
l usually prefer more attractive,
athletic, muscular men.

382
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,280
Maybe l could do a few push-ups
before you came over.

383
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,280
What about your fiancé?

384
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,080
lf you don't invite him, l won't.

385
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,480
-Any leads?
-lt's an inside job. No question.

386
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,440
-That's not what the cops say.
-They're wrong.

387
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,440
The Giants playing this afternoon?

388
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,600
They're playing the Cardinals,
in St. Louis.

389
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:08,120
Call my bookmaker. Make a bet for me
1 00 dollars on the Giants.

390
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,520
The Giant to win?

391
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,080
Naturally. What do you think,
to place?

392
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,160
Mr. Magruder? Tilt.

393
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,600
-The Kensington situation?
-lnside job, l'd bet my life on it.

394
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,480
You bet your life on the Giants,
and they're in 6th place.

395
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,920
Can we talk without the warden.

396
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,480
Miss Fitzgerald is part
of the company.

397
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,120
We must work together
in harmony.

398
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,720
Why do you think
it's an inside job?

399
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,280
Only an inside job would be
that smooth.

400
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:39,120
Miss Fitzgerald suggests
expanding our investigation.

401
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,960
-Meaning what?
-l appreciate the value of intuition.

402
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:46,240
But we're moving into a decade
of scientific innovation.

403
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,880
Miss Fitzgerald suggested
we might get you some help

404
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:53,560
by farming out some work to
an outside detective agency.

405
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:59,120
See if a new approach, fresh
techniques make a difference.

406
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,240
Don't be threatened immediately.

407
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:05,520
You said l'm only threatened by
women with high lQs.

408
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,720
North Coast has to keep up
with the marketplace.

409
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,080
There's a lot of money at stake.
The trail's growing cold.

410
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,160
lf Coopersmith Detective Agency
contributes, fine.

411
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,360
lf not, we're only out
a few bucks.

412
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:22,480
The Coopersmiths are like
Fric and Frac. They're submental.

413
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:26,560
We're moving into a new decade,
the 1 940s. Things are different.

414
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,920
Max Baer needs
a sparring partner.

415
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:35,120
You're the only person giving me
this kind of resistance.

416
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,280
You're a dinosaur, with your street
ways and disorganized methods.

417
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:42,320
Please. My father
always stressed harmony.

418
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,160
l've got to go.
l'm working on a case.

419
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,040
We'll have lunch. l know a restaurant
you'll love. Gestapo food.

420
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,920
Don't get hit by a bus, your body
mangled beyond recognition.

421
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,800
l ain't heard a word
about any job.

422
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:02,360
Nobody tried to fence anything
or do any bragging.

423
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,120
Charlie, you've got to help me
with this.

424
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,440
Keep your ears open. Anything
you hear, l got to know.

425
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,960
lt's very important to me.

426
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,840
50? You must be desperate.

427
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:17,920
You know where to reach me.
Keep eating carrots. They're working.

428
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,920
l think they're gone up there,
Mr. Briggs.

429
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:30,240
l just have to check something.
l'll be right down.

430
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,520
You startled me.
l was working late.

431
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,080
Eddie said he didn't think
anyone was up here.

432
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,960
Well, l'm here.

433
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,120
Obviously, l'm here.

434
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,400
Why are you so nervous?

435
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,960
l'm not nervous.
Why would l be nervous?

436
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:01,240
l'm working alone.
l didn't expect to see you.

437
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:05,040
Don't you always work late?
That's what l hear.

438
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,920
ls this Twenty Questions?

439
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,960
You scared me.
l'm alone, filling out reports.

440
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:14,360
Asking Magruder to remove
the water coolers?

441
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,240
Make wisecracks somewhere else.
l'm busy.

442
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:22,520
Don't work too late. The bags
under your eyes are getting bigger.

443
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,280
Good night. And if you have a sudden
coronary thrombosis,

444
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,360
go straight to the hospital.

445
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:36,160
You were right. We shouldn't
fool around at the office.

446
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:39,520
-He gives me the willies.
-He's harmless.

447
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:06,960
-How did you get in?
-lt wasn't hard.

448
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,120
You had your father
buy the building?

449
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:12,120
A small tip to the super
was all it took.

450
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:15,920
For you, maybe. l give the super
a small tip, he spits on my shoes.

451
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:20,240
l brought some very expensive
Russian vodka, 1 20 proof.

452
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,640
Don't drop that.
You'll blow up the building.

453
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:27,920
There's nothing to read but detective
magazines and the racing form.

454
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:31,680
No, l have a deck of cards
with naked women on them.

455
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,320
Let me guess,
you use it to play solitaire?

456
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,920
l used to date
the six of spades.

457
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,960
l love where you live.

458
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,000
lt's just what l thought,
a grimy, little rathole.

459
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,360
l'll tell my decorator.
lt's the effect we were going for.

460
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,280
You dying to see
my strawberry mark?

461
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:54,680
lf it's in the same spot
it was this afternoon.

462
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,440
This is a novelty for me.

463
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:01,040
l'm used to penthouses and yachts,
gorgeous European lovers who...

464
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,320
sweep me off my feet.

465
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:08,360
Yet, l find it strangely exciting
standing here in a grungy hovel

466
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,360
with a myopic
insurance clerk

467
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:15,360
There's a compliment in there
somewhere l just don't know where.

468
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:21,560
You taking that coat off?
lt hasn't rained in here in 20 years.

469
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,000
What do you think?

470
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,680
lf l happen to pass away while
we're doing anything,

471
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:39,360
have the embalmer leave
the smile on my face.

472
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,600
Perfect timing.

473
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:46,280
l'll slip into something more
comfortable and wait in bed.

474
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:50,000
More comfortable? Are you going
to put on Jergens lotion?

475
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,760
<i>Constantinople.</i>

476
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:58,080
You are in the power
of the Jade Scorpion.

477
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,320
<i>You will proceed
to the Dillworth mansion.</i>

478
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,720
You will enter and open the safe.

479
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,040
Ever heard of an lndian book
called the Kama Sutra?

480
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:17,440
l'm sorry, but we have to postpone
our little rendezvous.

481
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:18,840
Pardon me?

482
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:22,440
l just recalled a prior engagement.
l hope you don't mind.

483
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:27,320
The doorman will get you a taxi.
l had a wonderful evening. Thank you.

484
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,320
You're joking.

485
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,920
l'll turn around so you can
get dressed. Please hurry.

486
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,760
l'm rather pressed for time.

487
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,840
Have you got a loose screw?

488
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:41,720
Tonight was very meaningful to me.
l'll think of it in a cherished way.

489
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,560
lf you're in the neighborhood
again, drop in.

490
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,880
What's come over you?

491
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:50,000
Should you want a snack for
the way back home,

492
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,800
l have a dish of peanuts
in the other room.

493
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,520
You hate women, don't you?

494
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,960
Not at all.
They're a splendid gender.

495
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,720
Really.
A very pleasant variation.

496
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,880
l should have known.

497
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,680
A mousy, little clerk like you,
chasing criminals your entire life.

498
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:12,560
Laura, don't be cross.
Drop in again in the spring.

499
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,680
The oleander will be in bloom.

500
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,040
l'm going. l'm getting out.

501
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,080
l'm not used to getting kicked out
of a man's bed.

502
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,600
You're very sick.

503
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,600
Thanking you in advance for
understanding.

504
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:29,960
God bless you.
You have splendidly shaped buttocks.

505
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,640
l can't believe it. lt's identical.

506
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:15,200
Think someone from the Kensington
house pulled this one, too?

507
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:19,120
We did the security here.
We made the place foolproof.

508
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,760
Someone's a step ahead of you.

509
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,280
l want to speak
to the Dillworths.

510
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:26,000
The Coopersmith detectives
are grilling them.

511
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,320
l can't believe it!

512
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,480
She convinced Magruder to hire
the Coopersmiths.

513
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,520
We need all the help
we can get on this case.

514
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,520
You want to talk to me, fellas?

515
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,920
We're in on this now, C.W.

516
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,800
This is my case,
just so you know.

517
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:50,040
Like we horned in.
Hey, they called us.

518
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,960
-That was their first mistake.
-Maybe they think you're slipping.

519
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:56,080
-You know my brother Joe?
-The one who died at birth?

520
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,320
l hear you're having trouble.

521
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,920
-You guys got any clues?
-A few.

522
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,840
Want to share them with me?

523
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:07,360
l'll let you know if they're
real clues or a laundry list.

524
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:11,400
lf we make a collar, it'll mean
a long-term deal with North Coast.

525
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,840
l hear they're
making changes up there.

526
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,680
l'm going to make this bust

527
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:19,640
them you'll be back at your
old jobs finding lost poodles.

528
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:24,680
We laughed when we heard you said
the Kensington's was an inside job.

529
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,320
l can see we'll be tripping
all over each other.

530
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,200
One of us is going to fall down.

531
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,800
We don't plan on falling.

532
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:36,440
You're in over your heads.
This is a very smart burglar

533
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:40,360
and you can't figure it out
if you get a confession.

534
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:44,920
We figure we're looking for
a tall man, heavy set,

535
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,840
athletic, about
thirty years old.

536
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,600
Belly button in or out?

537
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:54,080
lf he's short, he's too fat to
squeeze through the kitchen window.

538
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,040
Show him the big clue.

539
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:59,040
Did the guy leave behind
his birth certificate?

540
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,280
Show him.

541
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,800
No one in this house was ever
to Rocky's Bar.

542
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:11,040
l've been to Rocky's Bar. Big deal.
6 million people eat there.

543
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,280
We're gonna nail this guy.

544
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,520
The important thing is,
don't think of us as competition.

545
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,760
Don't worry.
l don't.

546
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:26,640
Why are you upset? We'll get him.

547
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,520
Can you believe she talked Magruder
into hiring those jerks?

548
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:34,760
You've been moping all day.
What's going on?

549
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,520
l have a confession to make.

550
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:43,520
l woke up this morning and found
this on the floor of my apartment.

551
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,120
So?

552
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,240
l have no memory of being
with anybody last night.

553
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,960
That happens to everybody.

554
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,360
You pick up a broad, get drunk.
You didn't remember.

555
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:58,600
There was an empty bottle of vodka
on the floor. l don't drink vodka.

556
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,640
That's why you blacked out.
Vodka does funny things to a person.

557
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:05,640
l've gotten up with some
strange-looking heads under my arm.

558
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:10,240
No, there's something wrong, Al.
l came back here.

559
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:15,240
<i>I wanted to check something
in my office. I remember that.</i>

560
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:18,600
<i>This was about nine o'clock.</i>

561
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:22,920
<i>Wait a minute. I ran in.
Wait a minute.</i>

562
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,400
What?

563
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:28,840
Of course. No wonder l thought
it was an inside job.

564
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:33,160
But not inside the Dillworths'
or the Kensingtons'.

565
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,600
lt's inside our company.

566
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,600
lt's obvious.
Why didn't l see it right away?

567
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:44,040
Only Mize, Bond and me have
access to your security set-ups.

568
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,920
And what if someone else
was given access?

569
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,400
Someone we don't know as well

570
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:52,840
because she hasn't worked here
as long as we have?

571
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,880
Fitzgerald?

572
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,240
Why not? Why not?

573
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:00,840
We've had female
jewel thieves before.

574
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,520
She always saying she can do
anything a man can do.

575
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,720
l doubt she meant stealing.

576
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,080
What do we know about her? Nothing.

577
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:12,240
She has expensive tastes.
She wears good jewelry.

578
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,800
-l got to get into her office.
-Don't.

579
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,600
-l must.
-lf you get caught,

580
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:22,480
she'll take a gun a shoot you.
She goes duck hunting.

581
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,160
lt makes perfect sense.
She's here late every night.

582
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,120
We've given her the files.

583
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:32,080
She knows the security information.
l got to search her place.

584
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,200
Don't rifle her desk.
You'll get caught.

585
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,560
-What are you doing?
-Me?

586
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,600
You're going through my desk.

587
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,320
l beg your complete pardon.

588
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,560
You were snooping in my papers.

589
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:55,840
Only a suspicious, paranoid mind
would say something like that.

590
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:01,040
l doubt Amish people or Quakers
would come to that conclusion.

591
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,160
You wormy little ferret.

592
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,320
Now you're mixing metaphors.

593
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,240
-l know why you're snooping.
-l wasn't snooping.

594
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,520
To find the Coopersmiths' report.

595
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:13,200
You hired them to give me
a hard time.

596
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:16,200
lt's too many cooks,
we're all over each other.

597
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:20,360
They made more progress in a few
hours than you have in 2 days.

598
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,200
Were you crying? Your mascara.

599
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:26,120
Don't tap dance out of getting
caught searching my desk.

600
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,720
l wasn't searching.
l was rummaging.

601
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,800
Get out. lf l catch you going
through my stuff again...

602
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:36,080
-What are you afraid l'll find?
-You can't find your nose in the dark.

603
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:40,600
Watch out. l'm onto you.
l know what you are.

604
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:44,880
This is silly. We should both
calm down.

605
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,200
You could have a stroke

606
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:50,680
killing you instantly
or paralyzing half your body.

607
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:58,160
She hit the ceiling
when she caught me before.

608
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:01,640
Because she's guilty.
Look behind her eyes. She's bad.

609
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:02,920
She has pretty eyes.

610
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,280
l said look behind the eyes.
There's something wrong.

611
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,040
The minute l met her,
l sensed trouble.

612
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:13,000
lf you two were boxers, we could get
a millions dollar gate.

613
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,800
l got to get into her place.

614
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:18,440
Being an investigator doesn't
put you above the law.

615
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,800
She could get you locked up.

616
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:24,240
That ever stopped me before?
She's out tonight.

617
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:27,400
-How do you know?
-l went through her appointments.

618
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,880
She's meeting her sister for dinner.

619
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,680
She said her sister's
an invalid in Detroit.

620
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,440
See? Nothing she says ever
checks out.

621
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:38,600
You can't break into her apartment.
lt's unethical.

622
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,560
l won't break in. l got the key.

623
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,480
-How'd you get that?
-Stole it from her purse.

624
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:46,320
What happens when she finds it
missing?

625
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,520
She won't. l copied it and
put the original back.

626
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,520
You've a touch of larceny in you.
You'd have made a great thief.

627
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:57,360
lt takes one to catch one,
don't forget that. See you.

628
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,040
Can l take your coat, honey?

629
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,280
What did you want to tell me?

630
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,080
No drink?

631
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,680
How much alcohol do you need
to be completely honest?

632
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,840
-You're not making this easy.
-Why should l?

633
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,120
Because we care about each other.

634
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,400
Before you loved me.
Now you care for me?

635
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,960
-Betty Ann, sit down.
-l won't faint. l've been dumped.

636
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,840
Don't say things like that.

637
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:14,560
You got me out of the restaurant
because you were afraid

638
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,600
l'd make a scene or pass out.

639
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,360
You are a volatile woman.

640
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,040
Am l? Most men complain
l'm cool as ice.

641
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:24,080
-l care about you.
-You said that.

642
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:27,880
-l want to leave Caroline.
-But you're not.

643
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,680
l've tried to find the courage
a hundred times.

644
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,600
All those promises? Stories about
how miserable you were at home?

645
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,600
-You're making this into a nightmare.
-lsn't it?

646
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,880
Try to understand.
We can still be friends.

647
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,520
We can even continue
to sleep together.

648
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:48,160
Are you nuts? l only got involved
because you told me

649
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,480
your marriage was
on its last legs.

650
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,560
-Sounds like l deceived you.
-Haven't you?

651
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:57,440
l didn't mean to.
l respect you too much.

652
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:01,680
We went from ''love'' to you
''care for'' to you ''respect'' me.

653
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:04,200
Soon you'll be buying me
a prayer shawl.

654
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:08,960
Leave me alone. Okay?
Just go. l'll be fine.

655
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,240
-Honey, listen.
-Leave me alone!

656
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:17,240
l hope you stay at North Coast.
You're turning our company around.

657
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:20,360
Guess we won't be honeymooning
in Positano.

658
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,320
l feel like such a jerk!

659
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:25,360
Don't. l got into this against
my better judgment.

660
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,400
-Oh, honey.
-Just go.

661
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:13,680
Goodbye, Chris.

662
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:15,520
Goodbye, New York.

663
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:24,000
Miss Fitzgerald!
What are you doing?

664
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:26,600
What are you doing here?

665
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:29,160
-What do you mean?
-What are you doing here?

666
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:31,320
l was passing through.

667
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:36,120
-l was hiding behind your screen.
-Behind what?

668
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:39,440
That nice Japanese screen.
l was hiding behind it.

669
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:42,760
How did you get in?
How long have you been here?

670
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:44,720
Quite a while, actually.

671
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,000
-You broke into my apartment?
-No.

672
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,920
-How did you get in?
-You want to know?

673
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:51,600
-How did you get in?
-l made a copy of your key.

674
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:52,880
You what?

675
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:57,200
You can have it for no charge.
lt's good to have two keys.

676
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,200
Why did you do this?

677
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:03,120
l'm convinced that someone
at North coast

678
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,640
is responsible for
the jewel robbery.

679
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:06,920
Who, me?

680
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:10,000
-You're a prime suspect, yes.
-Based on what?

681
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:14,440
l know everyone better than you
and you have access to the data.

682
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,040
So do you.

683
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:18,720
But you were so nervous
the other night.

684
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:22,760
You acted strange and you have
a Rocky's matchbook.

685
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,360
Remember we had a drink at Rocky's?
lt didn't go too well.

686
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:29,840
So you broke into my apartment
and spied on me?

687
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:34,280
l wasn't spying.
l'm a big rummager.

688
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,240
You what?

689
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:40,720
l was rummaging and the afternoon
and saw ''dinner with my sister''.

690
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:45,080
All those dinners with your sister
were Magruder, right?

691
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,080
God, l'm mortified!

692
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:50,920
lf not for me, they'd be scraping
you up with spoon.

693
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:52,960
That's none of your business.

694
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:54,880
And over a jerk like Magruder.

695
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,400
He's not a jerk. He's twice
the man you are, you roach.

696
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:02,360
Don't you see? He tells you
stories to get in your pants.

697
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,040
He won't leave his wife.

698
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:05,640
You witnessed my humiliation.

699
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:09,560
lt's humiliating taking advantage
of a smart woman like you.

700
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:12,080
You're not fit to discuss
Chris Magruder.

701
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:14,760
Look at this. She still loves him.

702
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:18,240
Get out before l call the police
and have you arrested.

703
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:21,400
l'm not letting you alone here.
Are you crazy?

704
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:24,960
l'd ask if you had any friends,
but l know the answer.

705
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:28,160
Give me this. Jesus.

706
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:33,000
Great.

707
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:35,360
Are you okay?

708
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,000
Hello?

709
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:07,040
What are you doing here?

710
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:09,000
l'm making coffee.

711
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:13,920
l remember. You came here because
you thought l stole the jewels.

712
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:16,240
This is a very confusing case.

713
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:19,000
l'll say you're confused.
Why didn't you go home?

714
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,960
And let you do something crazy?

715
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,480
-like what?
-Like dive out the window.

716
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:27,680
-l wouldn't even with you here.
-Because l watched over you.

717
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:29,720
You stayed up watching me?

718
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:33,720
Yes. And you snore like a grizzly
bear with a sinus condition.

719
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,720
l had a bad moment.
l'm fine now.

720
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,960
-You talk in your sleep.
-You probably took notes, inchworm.

721
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:43,720
-Who's Rita?
-The woman my ex ran off with.

722
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:46,040
You sure know how to pick men.

723
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:48,360
There's not a lot to pick from.

724
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:52,240
You mentioned me, too.
You said l should rot in hell.

725
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:55,120
-l was probably awake.
-l figured you were felling better.

726
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:59,600
Now, if you'll go. Don't gossip
about what you saw last night.

727
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:04,200
Nobody's going to because l
couldn't care less about your life.

728
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:08,280
l couldn't stand you when l met you
and can't stand you now.

729
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,720
l find you obnoxious and pompous.

730
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:14,920
Do me a favor, if you see me
in the office walk the other way.

731
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:18,320
And if Magruder tells you
he's leaving his wife...

732
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:21,080
if l were you,
l'd keep my legs crossed.

733
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:23,440
Don't choke on breakfast
and die, unable to dislodge

734
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:27,480
a piece of toast,
no matter how hard you cough!

735
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:35,480
Mr. Magruder?

736
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:41,000
lf you'll all open your hymn books
to page 90.

737
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,720
Sit down, C.W.
We have a situation.

738
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:46,600
Your brother looks good.
The embalmer did nice work.

739
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:49,080
l'll let the Coopersmiths
fill you in.

740
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:53,480
After a careful search, using
up-to-the-minute techniques...

741
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:55,600
we found some interesting clues.

742
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,960
Leading to who,
Eleanor Roosevelt?

743
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:01,040
We got a shoe print
at the Kensington place.

744
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,160
So?

745
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:05,240
<i>An 8 1 l2-C Florsheim cordovan.</i>

746
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:10,160
Worn by 20 million Americans.
l wear them.

747
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:14,520
For this money, you cannot get
a better shoe.

748
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:16,800
We also found a couple of hairs.

749
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:21,640
One on the rug at the Kensington's,
the other in the Dillworth safe.

750
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,040
They match.

751
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:25,400
Forgive me if l'm not knocked out.

752
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:29,080
We don't mean just each other.
They match yours.

753
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:32,280
<i>Just like the 8 1 l2-C cordovans.</i>

754
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:35,080
l know you're angling
for my job...

755
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:39,680
-We got a print off the matchbook.
-A fingerprint off a matchbook?

756
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,120
Our lab uses sensitive apparatus.

757
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:46,600
-You're not going to say it's mine?
-lt is.

758
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:50,040
Well, so what?
So l leave a footprint or

759
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:52,440
inadvertently drop a matchbook.

760
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:55,600
The matchbook was found before
you got to the place.

761
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:01,200
You don't doubt my honesty, do you?
l was a Boy Scout for three years.

762
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:04,520
l have several merit badges and
my clergyman

763
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:07,880
who is wanted for pederasty,
will vouch for me.

764
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:10,440
Nobody's making any accusations.

765
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:15,040
You do have outstanding debts from
betting on baseball, the ponies.

766
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:17,320
Are you investigating me?

767
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:21,800
l assure you this is only
an inquiry in-house at this time.

768
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:25,600
We're not looking for bad publicity.

769
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:29,080
Miss Fitzgerald, what do you think?

770
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:32,000
You're a bright woman.
You think l did it?

771
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:36,040
Let's not have the daily bloodbath
between you and Miss Fitzgerald.

772
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:39,640
-She's not an investigator.
-But she has lots of ideas.

773
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,320
She brought these
mouth-breathers in.

774
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:44,640
C.W., lt's nothing personal.

775
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:48,320
We all want to catch the thief.
l'm on your side.

776
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:51,360
l think we have to get
team jackets.

777
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:56,280
Rosie, l want to get resumes
of all our employees.

778
00:49:56,520 --> 00:50:00,040
Don't worry, C.W. We'll get
to the bottom of this.

779
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:03,400
Miss Fitzgerald, l wanted to meet
with you later.

780
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:06,440
-About what?
-Our Paris account.

781
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:08,560
l believe that account is closed.

782
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,840
l have to see you,
just to talk.

783
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:14,720
l behaved like such a fool.
Later, just for a drink.

784
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:42,760
Well.

785
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:44,520
Can l come in?

786
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:48,440
Sure. l'm shocked.
The place is a little messy.

787
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:52,760
lf l knew you were coming, l'd have
had the maid rearrange the dirt.

788
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:54,280
Are you alone?

789
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:56,520
Alone? Of course.

790
00:50:56,840 --> 00:51:00,080
l'd have called, but l decided
it was safer to talk in person.

791
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:03,040
-''Safer''?
-l can't stay long.

792
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,160
You meeting Magruder in Paris?

793
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:07,080
That's none of your business.

794
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:10,960
Thanks for defending me today.
lt was nice of you.

795
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:12,960
That's what l want to discuss.

796
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:16,760
The Coopersmiths questioned
Laura Kensington today.

797
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,600
She said she was with you
the night before last.

798
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:22,640
You got a phone call,
began acting very strangely...

799
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:26,080
and got rid of her because
you had somewhere to go.

800
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:28,120
She's lying.

801
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:29,840
Why would she lie?

802
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:34,400
Use you head. Would l kick
Laura Kensington out of bed?

803
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:36,640
Even if the President needed me.

804
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:40,360
-Why are you lying?
-Why this crazy story?

805
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:44,880
Because l should've spoken up today.
Even if you are a mealy-mouthed...

806
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:48,000
-Reptile.
-...reptile, you're no jewel thief.

807
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:49,560
Why are you so positive?

808
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:52,280
lt's too daring for you.
You're not romantic enough.

809
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:56,360
lt requires flair, imagination.
My instincts say it's not you.

810
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:59,040
-l didn't think you had instincts.
-l do.

811
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:03,520
l don't usually trust them
about men, but this time l do.

812
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:07,040
You're good at weasely things,
like snooping and spying.

813
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:09,120
You're not man enough for a burglar.

814
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:11,600
Sounds like you're attracted to
men who break the law.

815
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:15,360
Let's not discuss me.
Let's discuss what Laura said.

816
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:19,120
Laura Kensington was not here.
She...

817
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:21,000
She was not here.

818
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:24,360
She said she left
her stocking here.

819
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:28,720
That could be anybody's.
Lots of women pass through here.

820
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:31,000
There's a lot of action here.

821
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:33,440
l'm sure you're not particular.

822
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:36,480
Look, what do you want from me?

823
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:41,040
l enjoy a well-proportioned
member of the opposite sex.

824
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:45,120
That's how God created us.
Who am l to quibble with His concept?

825
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:48,240
A case is building against you.
Be honest with me!

826
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:50,720
-l'm honest.
-Where did you get this stocking?

827
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:55,280
Some broad's. Women lose an
earring, a stocking, l don't know.

828
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:59,440
Laura says it's hers.
She says the super let her in.

829
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:01,080
The story checks out.

830
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:03,640
Whoever that is, l'm not here.

831
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:08,720
-Who is it?
-Herb and Joe Coopersmith.

832
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:10,760
l don't want to be seen here.

833
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,560
Why? Am l a leper?

834
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:15,240
You're a suspect.
l'd have explaining to do.

835
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:19,200
You're still hooked on Magruder.

836
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:22,040
Go to the bedroom, shut the door.

837
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:24,800
Can l sit down,
or will l catch something?

838
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:28,480
Germs can't live in your blood.
lt's too cold.

839
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:36,080
Open up, C.W.!

840
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:37,680
Coming.

841
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:51,080
Sure you got the right apartment?
The mousetraps are in the basement.

842
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:53,080
Can we come in?

843
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:57,160
Wait. l got a chorus girl
in the back room.

844
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:00,040
lt isn't Laura Kensington, is it?

845
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:03,840
l don't know. They all look
the same upside down.

846
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:06,400
She says she was here
the other night,

847
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:09,800
till you dumped her to go out
on some mysterious business.

848
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:12,960
Would l dump Laura Kensington?
l eat Wheaties.

849
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:16,440
But Eddie, the night guard
at the North Coast building,

850
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:21,000
said you made strange, middle-
of-the-night visits to your office

851
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,120
the nights of both robberies.

852
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:27,280
l'd love to chat, but there's
a nurse in the other room.

853
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:29,920
-l thought she was a chorus girl.
-Who does a little nursing.

854
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:34,600
Gimme a break. Can we talk tomorrow?

855
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:39,520
How can you make love?
You're facing a long jail sentence.

856
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:43,160
That's why l got to get in
all l can now.

857
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:46,160
We'll turn this over
to the police tomorrow.

858
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:48,640
The case is pretty incriminating.

859
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:51,040
lt's just circumstantial evidence.

860
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:54,760
Many a man's gone to the gallows
on circumstantial evidence.

861
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:59,200
The gallows will have to wait.
l got a cocktail waitress.

862
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:00,920
Cocktail waitress?

863
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:04,600
A nurse who's a bit of
a chorus girl

864
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:06,920
and works a lounge now and then.

865
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:10,920
Tell me if you catch the thief.
l'll get you both new yo-yos.

866
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:18,920
What is this?

867
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:22,240
l was browsing through
your bookshelf...

868
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:26,720
and l found this deck of
naked playing cards and these.

869
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:30,560
What? This is the
Kensington jewels!

870
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:35,520
This is the Dillworth jewels.
And this is...

871
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:39,600
Why are you looking
at me like that?

872
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:43,760
Because you found them among
my collection of female art studies?

873
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:46,640
What? l used to go with
the six of spades.

874
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:49,520
Then the four of diamonds
caught us together and...

875
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:53,760
l knew you sneaked up to the office
and the guard caught you.

876
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:58,120
You have Laura's stocking and
she swears you kicked her out of bed

877
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:00,840
to take care of
some sudden business.

878
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:04,240
They have a footprint,
a matchbook with your fingerprint.

879
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:07,120
Still, l believed that
you didn't do it.

880
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:11,520
But now the stolen property
turns up hidden in your bedroom.

881
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:14,040
And what?
This makes you suspect me?

882
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:18,160
l was touched you stayed up
all night watching over me.

883
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:22,080
l thought, ''Maybe he's not the
scummy vermin he seems to be.''

884
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:26,840
l may be scummy vermin, but l'm
honest. l didn't take these jewels.

885
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:28,960
How can you deny it?

886
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:33,200
Yes, l grant you,
there's a fingerprint of mine,

887
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:37,360
and a footprint and the jewels
are in my bedroom.

888
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:41,080
l'm starting to think
l'm in tremendous trouble.

889
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:42,760
l'm calling the police.

890
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:45,840
Forget logic. Give me
the benefit of the doubt.

891
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:48,520
-That makes me an accessory.
-Not if l'm innocent.

892
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:51,040
lnnocent? You haven't a
kosher bone in your body.

893
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:55,720
That's how you get into problems.
Magruder's waiting for you, right?

894
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:59,800
You make wrong decisions because
you make them here, not here.

895
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:04,520
They're not reliable because this
is gray cells and this is blood.

896
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:08,840
Blood circulates, it gets around.
lt knows the score.

897
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:13,320
Gray cells just lay there
and think. See what l mean?

898
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:18,880
Constantinople.

899
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:22,200
You will take all of the jewels.

900
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:24,360
<i>Make sure you have them all.</i>

901
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:28,160
<i>Wrap them in brown paper so
no on can tell what they are.</i>

902
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:32,000
Go to Grand Central Station.
Rent a locker. Lock them in.

903
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:35,800
Go home, taking the key with you.
Put it in your mailbox.

904
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:38,080
Leave the mailbox open.

905
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:41,200
Then you will go into
a deep, refreshing slumber.

906
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:45,040
When you awake, you will remember
nothing of what transpired.

907
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:52,600
Miss Fitzgerald,

908
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:56,480
have l ever told you...

909
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:01,160
you're one of the most beautiful
women l've ever met?

910
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:04,120
-l'm turning you in.
-l mean it.

911
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:07,560
Your eyes are what made me
first fall in love with you.

912
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:10,720
Unbelievable. You're trying to
sweet talk me?

913
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:14,680
l resisted because down deep
l thought you might hurt me.

914
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:17,360
l don't want to be
in that position again.

915
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:22,400
l wouldn't be interested in you
if you were the last man on Earth.

916
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:26,840
And l'm insulted you think l would
fall for such a heavy-handed ploy.

917
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:29,360
You must have a low opinion of me.

918
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:32,400
Thank you for dropping by.
l'm a little busy now.

919
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:35,480
Maybe tomorrow night
we can have dinner.

920
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:39,360
l can look into your eyes and
tell you how crazy about you l am.

921
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:42,920
lf l didn't know what a
squirming, trapped rat you were,

922
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:45,400
l'd think you had a brain tumor.

923
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:04,440
-You're late.
-l'm still trembling.

924
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:06,720
Over last night?
l didn't sleep.

925
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,800
lt's not that, Chris.
lt's Briggs.

926
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:13,400
He's guilty, isn't he?
lt's a sad story.

927
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:16,000
Don't make me
go into the details,

928
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:19,440
but l wonder if he's
having a mental breakdown.

929
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:23,320
He may be realizing
the consequences of his deeds.

930
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:26,440
Could he have a split personality?

931
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:30,320
Many criminals play crafty games
when it suits their purposes.

932
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:31,920
l need a drink.

933
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:36,360
lf l tell you something, promise
not to go off half-cocked?

934
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:39,360
Okay, but hurry.
l have some big news.

935
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:41,320
l found the jewels.

936
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:56,120
Keep me apprised, will you?
Thank you.

937
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:02,200
The police are on the way.
lt's an open and shut case.

938
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:05,360
l hate the publicity,
but l'm elated at the recovery.

939
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:08,640
lt's clear there's much more
to this, Chris.

940
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:12,400
Being around big money
can drive men to extremes.

941
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:17,200
These guys expose exotic schemes
to defraud and rob people.

942
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:22,160
Some think ''l know why they fail.
l won't make mistakes''.

943
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:26,360
So he's cracked from
so many years of hard work?

944
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:30,360
He's a driven man. He had a
terrible marital experience.

945
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:35,600
Turned him off women, except for
secretaries and barflies.

946
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:39,720
Crushed when he caught his wife
cheating, he's feeling older,

947
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,200
he looks around and says
''Maybe it's time l get mine.''

948
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:48,080
Guy named Peterson tried the same.
Now he's a houseguest in Sing Sing.

949
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:51,280
l'm sure you know him
better than l do.

950
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:53,600
lt'll resolve itself.

951
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:58,000
Betty Ann, l spoke with Caroline.

952
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:00,360
You did?

953
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:03,040
l told her
l wanted my freedom.

954
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:04,640
Really?

955
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:07,840
-lsn't that fabulous?
-lt's surprising.

956
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:10,080
l thought you'd be
knocked off your feet.

957
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:14,280
Well, it was last night.
lt's sort of a roller coaster.

958
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:17,640
Forget last night. l knew
l made a mistake right away.

959
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:19,680
What did she say?

960
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:24,040
She sensed we were drifting apart.
She was very poised.

961
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:27,920
Said if l was sure
that's what l wanted.

962
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:31,120
Another one of these, please.

963
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:35,800
You're not as euphoric
as l'd imagined.

964
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:39,920
You can't expect me to
change gears and turn on a dime.

965
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:42,800
Have you changed your mind?

966
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:45,320
No.

967
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:48,840
-You haven't met someone else?
-No, l haven't.

968
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:01,280
l don't understand.
What's going on? What did l do?

969
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:05,080
These are the ones.
They were in his bookcase.

970
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:09,440
He bets every day
and he usually loses.

971
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:12,240
He's into the bookmakers
for a bundle.

972
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:18,280
l was with him Tuesday till 1 2.
He got a call and was different.

973
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:24,680
lf it was anyone but C.W.,
we wouldn't be discussing this.

974
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,600
The jewels were in his locker.
An air-tight case.

975
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:32,400
l knew you guys wanted my job,
but l could get 30 years for this.

976
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,360
With good behavior,
you'll be out in 20.

977
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:40,240
l'll check every low-l.Q. club.
l'll find you and kill you.

978
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:42,720
Low l.Q., some genius.

979
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:46,480
lf you needed money, C.W.,
you could've come to me.

980
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:50,200
l'd have listened, though l
warned you about your gambling.

981
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:52,560
Can't you see
this is a conspiracy?

982
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:56,280
They plant some prints.
The night guard forges my signature.

983
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:59,080
This crazy girl who smokes opium
invents a story.

984
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:01,600
Fitzgerald plants the jewels
in my house.

985
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:05,200
There's a word for people who think
everyone's conspiring against them.

986
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:06,440
Yeah, ''perceptive''.

987
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:09,560
You tried to swallow
the key to the locker

988
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:12,400
where we found
the stolen goods.

989
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:14,840
-You got any witnesses?
-Yeah, me.

990
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:16,920
You'd take your word over mine?

991
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:18,760
Let's get him to the courthouse.

992
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:20,640
You better get a lawyer, C.W.

993
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:22,960
l'm shocked.
He was one of my best men.

994
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:25,360
You know how long l've know him?
Tommy, come with me.

995
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:29,960
Okay, Mike. Sorry, C.W.,
l'll arrange things. Stick around.

996
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:51,080
Well, well, if it isn't
Mr. Fast-Talking lnvestigator

997
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:54,320
caught with his hand
in the cookie jar.

998
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:56,400
Did l really throw you out of bed?

999
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:59,520
Why? You planning on using
the insanity defense?

1000
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:02,760
Honey, l need help,
and you're going to help me.

1001
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:04,240
Am l?

1002
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:07,160
What makes you think that?

1003
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:10,920
This is your kind of thing.
lt'll look great on your resume.

1004
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:14,680
A suspected felon, a daring escape
in broad daylight.

1005
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:17,040
You like this kind of thing.

1006
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:22,120
Check the top drawer.
There must be a handcuff key.

1007
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:23,720
l'm nervous.

1008
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:27,160
See if there's a key.
Go. Hurry up.

1009
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:29,520
l got to make this fast.

1010
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:33,840
Or they'll put me away. l'll be
showering with men my whole life.

1011
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:36,840
Miss, l'm sorry.
No one's allowed in here.

1012
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:39,440
You want to come with me?

1013
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:55,200
Let's go, unless you want to
be locked up, too.

1014
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:58,240
-Sorry things didn't work out.
-Let's go.

1015
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:01,240
-You want to lock me up?
-What's wrong?

1016
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:04,360
-Take your hands off me!
-Something wrong with you?

1017
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:33,920
Caroline and l are working on
the separation agreement.

1018
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:36,800
l move out in 2 weeks.
The divorce will take longer.

1019
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:39,520
That's why the agreement
must be secure.

1020
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:42,360
l could get killed if
we were found together.

1021
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:45,400
-Where are you?
-Do you think he's guilty?

1022
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:49,480
-That's what you're thinking about?
-l have this uneasy feeling.

1023
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:52,000
That he's innocent?
He was caught red-handed.

1024
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:54,320
lt just doesn't feel right.

1025
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:57,880
l don't see that snoopy termite
as a romantic jewel thief.

1026
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:00,600
l'd hardly call breaking
the law romantic.

1027
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:02,360
l didn't mean it that way.

1028
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:04,880
Well, what did you mean?

1029
01:06:05,080 --> 01:06:07,160
l don't know what l mean anymore.

1030
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:14,000
Yes, he is. Hold on.

1031
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:16,440
lt's the Coopersmiths.

1032
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:22,120
Really?

1033
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:25,040
How?

1034
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:28,640
Okay. Yes, l certainly will.

1035
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:34,280
This should allay your doubts
about his culpability. He escaped.

1036
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:38,920
Unlocked the handcuffs and
leaped to the building next door.

1037
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:41,840
-C.W. Briggs?
-Like a common burglar.

1038
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:45,880
l'm starting to realize
none of us really knew him.

1039
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:50,520
l have to go to police headquarters.
Your little termite ate his way out.

1040
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:08,520
-Did you forget...?
-Resist the urge to scream.

1041
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:10,880
What are you doing here,
you jewel thief!

1042
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:14,000
l'm not a thief, l'm a suspect.
Completely different.

1043
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:18,400
A promising suspect, but l didn't
do it and l need time to prove it.

1044
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:23,120
Or they'll lock me up and you could
only insult me on visiting days.

1045
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:26,040
-Why did you come here?
-l have no one else to turn to.

1046
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:29,720
Everyone knows you hate me
so no one will look for me here.

1047
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:32,080
l need a place to sleep.
l'm exhausted.

1048
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:35,120
You can't sleep here. l can't
afford the fumigation bills.

1049
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:37,960
You want to call the police,
call them. l don't care.

1050
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:42,240
l'm sleeping here. lf you want to
call them, then call them.

1051
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:50,280
Get me the 1 1th Precinct.

1052
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:16,840
<i>Miss Fitzgerald?</i>

1053
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:20,040
<i>Madagascar.</i>

1054
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:23,960
You are in a deep trance.

1055
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:27,720
You will obey every command
the Jade Scorpion gives you.

1056
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:32,160
You will acquire all security data
for the Adrian Greenwood mansion.

1057
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:37,160
You will proceed there,
and after disabling the system

1058
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:41,600
you will remove all the jewels
from the safe, each and every one.

1059
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:46,200
These jewels you will hide
in your apartment. ls this clear?

1060
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:47,720
Yes.

1061
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:46,920
What's the matter?
Can't sleep?

1062
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:48,480
No.

1063
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:51,480
l've had the strangest dreams.

1064
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,560
l've had some crazy dreams
myself lately.

1065
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:56,760
l dreamed we were
finally together.

1066
01:09:57,040 --> 01:10:01,480
You and Magruder? A match made
in heaven by a retarded angel.

1067
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:05,640
You misunderstand. l dreamed
you and l wound up together.

1068
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:08,320
That's funny.
l didn't hear screaming.

1069
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:11,680
The minute l met you,
l knew inside l'd found...

1070
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:14,440
what l'd been searching for
all my life.

1071
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:19,440
A roach? A vermin? A worm?
Did l call you a Black Widow?

1072
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:24,320
l knew that sooner or later
we'd wind up in each other's arms.

1073
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:27,400
Have you been gargling
with the tequila?

1074
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:32,000
You're a very romantic man.

1075
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:35,160
What did you smoke
before l woke up?

1076
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:39,520
And if l told you l had the most
passionate crush on you l ever felt?

1077
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:43,640
l'd fear for my life because
l'd think it was a set-up.

1078
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:47,240
This song was playing
the time we met at Rocky's Bar.

1079
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:51,400
You remember? Not that l didn't have
a good time, but l didn't.

1080
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:55,240
My passion for you is so intense,
it scares me.

1081
01:10:55,920 --> 01:11:00,120
Can't you see l've submerged it
under hostile acts and words?

1082
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:04,480
Don't worry, l never really
took it seriously.

1083
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:08,800
''Crush you like an insect''
just meant ''back off a little''.

1084
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:12,200
Couldn't you see l was
just protecting myself?

1085
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:14,360
-Miss Fitzgerald...
-Call me Betty Ann.

1086
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:16,200
l hate to be a killjoy,

1087
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:20,760
but if this is a scheme to take
advantage of me, it's not subtle.

1088
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:24,480
You're the man l'm going to marry.
l knew it right away.

1089
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:28,200
We should call Bellevue.
You need electric shock, honey.

1090
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:29,840
Kiss me?

1091
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:32,840
Me? Lay a wet one on you?

1092
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:37,920
l imagined if you kissed me,
l'd feel those fireworks.

1093
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:41,520
-Are you like this out of the office?
-What are you thinking?

1094
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:46,000
lt's a pity we hate each other
or we could've had a large family.

1095
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:47,440
l'm going to swoon.

1096
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:50,040
Steady. l affect women
this way sometimes.

1097
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:51,880
-l can't stay awake.
-Easy.

1098
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:53,720
l'll rest my head on you.

1099
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:58,240
Easy. l must remember what soap
l used this morning.

1100
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,600
What are you doing here?

1101
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,520
Good morning, sweetheart.

1102
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:16,840
Don't call me that.
What's going on?

1103
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:21,360
l stayed awake thinking about
those things you said.

1104
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:25,240
And all of that rang
a deep bell with me.

1105
01:12:25,720 --> 01:12:29,600
There were so many times when
we were arguing in the office

1106
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:33,160
that l had the feeling that
down deep, underneath,

1107
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:35,080
you were crazy about me.

1108
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:37,960
About you?
Were you dropped on your head?

1109
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:42,040
Hey, toots, l got to tell you,
last night, for a cold fish,

1110
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:43,680
you were hot stuff.

1111
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:46,840
Buster, don't call me
''toots'' or ''sweetheart''.

1112
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:50,640
l'm not some Available Annie
who takes dictation on your lap.

1113
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:54,040
What'd you do, sneak in here
and slip into my arms?

1114
01:12:54,280 --> 01:12:58,280
What's going on? Last night you
tried to undress me and kiss me.

1115
01:12:58,520 --> 01:13:02,840
What? You came in here and
passed out. l'm confused.

1116
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:07,760
<i>The Kensington and Dillworth
jewel thief has struck again.</i>

1117
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:13,080
<i>C.W. Briggs, former employee of
North Coast Fidelity and Casualty,</i>

1118
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:18,120
<i>is the chief suspect in the
Adrian Greenwood robbery.</i>

1119
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:21,760
<i>The details of the crime
are the same as the first two.</i>

1120
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:26,520
<i>The thief took $ 1 million in
jewelry and a like amount in cash.</i>

1121
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:29,760
<i>Police recovered the jewels
from the earlier burglaries</i>

1122
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:33,480
<i>which led to the capture
and arrest of C.W. Briggs.</i>

1123
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:35,480
So that's why you escaped.

1124
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:38,960
Not to prove your innocence,
but for unfinished business.

1125
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:40,880
But l was here with you!

1126
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:45,000
For some reason l can't remember.
But l was asleep.

1127
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:47,200
You could've awakened,

1128
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:51,040
robbed these people and come back.
You used this as a safe haven.

1129
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:55,760
l could've, but l didn't.
You tried to undress and kiss me.

1130
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:59,120
l've never tried to undress you
in my life.

1131
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:03,520
l wouldn't kiss you if we were
on a desert island for 20 years.

1132
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:08,080
After 20 minutes l'd make a bow
and arrow and kill you.

1133
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:12,440
What are you thinking?
l'm marrying Chris Magruder.

1134
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:14,720
-You are?
-Yes.

1135
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:17,840
We set a spring date,
when his divorce is final.

1136
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:21,880
So if l was trying to kiss you,
l must have multiple personalities.

1137
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:26,040
lf you marry Chris Magruder,
you have multiple stupidity.

1138
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:28,920
lt must have been
the booze.

1139
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:32,440
You were like a changed person,
and a much better one.

1140
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:36,600
lf you're here after l take
a shower, l'm calling the police.

1141
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:42,000
For a minute you dropped your guard.
Your were actually sexy.

1142
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:46,880
Though in some lights,
you resemble Mussolini.

1143
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:58,600
Pretty snazzy
for an office worker.

1144
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:03,040
Magruder must love you
in an extravagant way.

1145
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:07,840
He probably likes going to Paris
with you more than with his wife.

1146
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:21,360
l understand you and Charlie
got something.

1147
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:23,600
l came up with a name.

1148
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:26,040
Really? Well, lay it on me.

1149
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:28,560
Eddie Polgar.

1150
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:30,360
Who's that?

1151
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:33,400
l don't know,
but it's come up twice.

1152
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:35,000
Eddie Polgar?

1153
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:39,160
There's no police record.
lt could be an alias.

1154
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:43,520
Blue men coming.
Keep moving.

1155
01:15:46,160 --> 01:15:48,400
-Charlie.
-C.W., is that you?

1156
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:51,240
-l heard you wanted me.
-You're hot as a pistol.

1157
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:55,600
The police want to give me
a lifetime achievement award.

1158
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:59,400
Does the name Eddie Polgar mean
anything to you?

1159
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:03,240
-Zero.
-l can't get a break.

1160
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:05,320
Stick your hand in the cup.

1161
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:08,120
-ln the cup?
-ln the cup, yeah.

1162
01:16:12,160 --> 01:16:14,120
38 cents and a wad of paper.

1163
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:17,000
And someone threw away their gum
in your business establishment.

1164
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:19,160
Open the wad of paper.

1165
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:22,680
-Why?
-lt's a clue.

1166
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:24,200
What kind of clue?

1167
01:16:24,440 --> 01:16:28,480
From last night's heist.
Coopersmiths found it on the driveway.

1168
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:32,520
Charlie...

1169
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:34,560
The burglar dropped it.

1170
01:16:34,760 --> 01:16:35,960
How'd you get it?

1171
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:40,120
A friend of a friend works
in the Coopersmiths' building.

1172
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:42,360
l thought you might want it.

1173
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:45,080
These earrings
are grand larceny.

1174
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:48,280
l see by the look on your face
that l helped you.

1175
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:53,200
Cherchez la femme.
You know what that means?

1176
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:55,360
''Find the woman''.

1177
01:16:55,720 --> 01:16:57,080
ls there a woman?

1178
01:16:57,480 --> 01:16:59,640
At first l thought so.

1179
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:01,560
Then l didn't.

1180
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:03,840
Now l think l got her.

1181
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:07,440
You work next to a person
for years and one day...

1182
01:17:07,680 --> 01:17:10,440
l don't believe it.
Not C. W. lt makes no sense.

1183
01:17:10,720 --> 01:17:14,000
None of us expected it,
but there is proof.

1184
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:17,000
Fitzgerald saw the jewels
in his apartment.

1185
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:20,600
-He fought the cops over that key.
-Exactly.

1186
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:25,200
lt's open-and-shut. You don't run
from the police if you're innocent.

1187
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:30,200
What about the nerve it took to strike
twice? C.W. deserves some credit.

1188
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:33,520
He turned out
to be a gutsy guy.

1189
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:40,440
Where are you?

1190
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:44,280
Never mind where l am.
l got to get up to the office.

1191
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:48,720
l think more people are involved
in this thing.

1192
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,960
l think Fitzgerald
is behind it.

1193
01:17:52,280 --> 01:17:57,280
Does the name Eddie Polgar mean
anything to you?

1194
01:17:57,680 --> 01:17:58,360
No.

1195
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:02,800
l got to get to the office and
go over the Coopersmiths' report.

1196
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:06,720
And l want to check out
Fitzgerald's desk again.

1197
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:20,000
There's no question, Fitzgerald
is involved in this up to her neck.

1198
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:24,480
You can't let your feelings
for this woman color your judgment.

1199
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:28,960
lt has nothing to do with that.
lt's the only thing that makes sense.

1200
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:33,120
l go to her house, figuring no one
will look for me there

1201
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:36,040
because she hates me so.
l go to sleep.

1202
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:39,760
Middle of the night, l hear
a noise and wake up. l find her.

1203
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:42,560
l figure, she can't sleep,
either.

1204
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:47,160
But, no. She'd done the Greenwood
heist and coming back.

1205
01:18:47,680 --> 01:18:51,000
l'd caught her, so she starts
to act very peculiar.

1206
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:55,480
l trap her, so she starts
seducing me with her feminine wiles.

1207
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:56,920
Meaning what?

1208
01:18:57,120 --> 01:19:01,360
Suddenly, l'm handsome and
and she can't her hands off me.

1209
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,120
Does that sound like
Fitzgerald?

1210
01:19:04,360 --> 01:19:07,240
Or a schemer trying to play me
for a sucker?

1211
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:11,560
lt sounds like that magic show
demonstration by Voltan Polgar.

1212
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:14,640
Yeah. The night
of the first robbery.

1213
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:16,920
l think she has feelings for you.

1214
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:19,480
Don't be ridiculous.
She hates me.

1215
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:23,800
What's the name of the magician
whose name

1216
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:26,400
l've completely repressed?

1217
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:28,280
Voltan.

1218
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:31,560
Voltan the lnscrutable.
The Jade Scorpion.

1219
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:33,200
What is his name?

1220
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:36,840
Voltan Polgar.
Eli Voytak Polgar.

1221
01:19:39,160 --> 01:19:41,840
l'm just theorizing...

1222
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:45,280
on an incredible sequence
of events.

1223
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:49,120
You look like my Uncle Jerry
after a truck hit him.

1224
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:53,880
What happened? l know you told me
before, but what happened?

1225
01:19:54,240 --> 01:19:56,320
They brought me onstage...

1226
01:19:56,600 --> 01:20:00,320
He put you in a trance, easily,
despite your resistance.

1227
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:03,440
Right, yes. Then he brought...

1228
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,440
Fitzgerald was with me
at the time.

1229
01:20:06,720 --> 01:20:09,640
Then you were awakened
in a post-hypnotic state

1230
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:12,360
with a word that
would put you back under.

1231
01:20:12,680 --> 01:20:13,920
''Constantinople''.

1232
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:16,520
Then he started making these...

1233
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:21,600
C.W.?

1234
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:23,600
C.W.?

1235
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:25,400
Yes?

1236
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:27,200
Are you okay?

1237
01:20:28,280 --> 01:20:31,920
l'm fine, Alvin.
How is your aging mother?

1238
01:20:32,280 --> 01:20:35,160
Obviously, he was never released
from the key word.

1239
01:20:35,680 --> 01:20:37,880
Wake him up, George.
This is scary.

1240
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:41,160
Don't be scared.
This is right up my alley.

1241
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:44,480
When l snap my fingers,
you will awaken.

1242
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:48,680
You will have no memory
of what occurred. ls that clear?

1243
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:54,760
You'll awaken feeling happy
and refreshed. ls that clear?

1244
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:01,000
So the guy gets me onstage.
Then what?

1245
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:04,080
Wait. l have an idea.
Constantinople.

1246
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:08,760
What a sense of power.

1247
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:13,080
Can you make him recall everything,
then free him from it for good?

1248
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:17,640
When l snap my fingers,
you will awaken.

1249
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:20,760
Your memory will be clear,
crystal clear.

1250
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:24,200
The events of the past week
will come to you vividly.

1251
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:26,040
And with no distraction.

1252
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:29,040
You will be freed
from your trance...

1253
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:32,840
and the word ''Constantinople''
will have no meaning to you.

1254
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:36,640
lt will not put back into your
hypnotic state.

1255
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:40,200
One, you're coming out of it.

1256
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:44,520
Two, your memories of the past week
are coming back.

1257
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:47,880
Three, you're fully awake.

1258
01:21:49,080 --> 01:21:53,600
l took the jewels!
The Kensington and the Dill...

1259
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:58,000
Then he probably tried to get me
and couldn't.

1260
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:02,960
The Greenwood thing was her...
what is Fitzgerald's key word?

1261
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:04,920
Madagascar.

1262
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,200
<i>The Jade Scorpion
wants the jewels.</i>

1263
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:12,520
Wrap them in brown paper
and bring them to him.

1264
01:22:12,760 --> 01:22:15,640
Mark down the following
address in Chinatown.

1265
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:49,080
Miss Fitzgerald?

1266
01:23:06,920 --> 01:23:11,520
Sergeant, his name's Voltan Polgar.
Someone just gave me an address.

1267
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:33,360
Miss Fitzgerald.
The Jade Scorpion welcomes you.

1268
01:23:34,240 --> 01:23:36,160
You have my package.

1269
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:39,600
Thank you.

1270
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:42,960
You will now return home
and go to sleep...

1271
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:46,880
a wonderful sleep, from
which you'll awaken cheerfully.

1272
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:51,640
You will remember nothing
of these events. Ever.

1273
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:05,040
l was just passing through.
l thought l'd say hello.

1274
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:09,520
C.W. Briggs, l seem to have
underestimated you.

1275
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:12,960
The story of my life.
Everybody underestimates me.

1276
01:24:13,240 --> 01:24:16,760
They think l'm a pushover.
lt makes my work much easier.

1277
01:24:17,160 --> 01:24:20,640
l've seen some exotic schemes,
but this one was a beauty.

1278
01:24:20,840 --> 01:24:23,960
But l figured it out.
That's why l get top-dollar.

1279
01:24:24,440 --> 01:24:28,280
Don't force me to take extreme
measures, Mr. Briggs.

1280
01:24:29,160 --> 01:24:32,320
-You'd never pull that trigger.
-Oh? Why?

1281
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:36,800
Murder's not your game. My instinct
tells me that. You're a jewel thief.

1282
01:24:37,480 --> 01:24:40,800
There's a big difference between
doing time for stealing jewels

1283
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:43,400
and frying
in the electric chair.

1284
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:47,360
Once they pump 200 millions volts
of electricity through you

1285
01:24:47,640 --> 01:24:51,480
you have a tendency to spend
the rest of your days in an ashtray.

1286
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:09,120
For a minute, l thought
l overplayed my hand.

1287
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:18,960
You're the bravest, most brilliant,
most courageous man l've ever met.

1288
01:25:19,640 --> 01:25:22,440
l would go to the ends
of the earth with you.

1289
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:26,360
Everybody should have someone
they feel that way about.

1290
01:25:26,640 --> 01:25:30,640
lt's such a shame that
you have to wake up from

1291
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:33,680
this fabulous illusion.

1292
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:36,960
Just once,

1293
01:25:37,400 --> 01:25:40,800
before the ugly curtain
of reality

1294
01:25:41,320 --> 01:25:43,240
drops on both of us.

1295
01:25:57,880 --> 01:25:59,800
You kiss great.

1296
01:26:05,720 --> 01:26:06,960
What a wrap-up.

1297
01:26:07,160 --> 01:26:09,760
-See Herb Coopersmith's face?
-Serves him right.

1298
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:14,000
Where will Fitzgerald and Magruder
go for their romantic getaway?

1299
01:26:14,360 --> 01:26:17,680
His divorce isn't for months.
l hear his wife couldn't care less.

1300
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:20,040
l hear the wedding's in June.

1301
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:23,080
l heard him talking about
going to Paris.

1302
01:26:27,480 --> 01:26:30,400
Mr. Magruder, l just came
to say l'm leaving.

1303
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:34,120
What can l say?
We all make mistakes.

1304
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:38,280
You have to admit, they had
a strong case against you.

1305
01:26:38,680 --> 01:26:40,720
l know you could get
a job anywhere.

1306
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,960
But if you decide to stay,
you'll have a raise.

1307
01:26:44,280 --> 01:26:48,240
Miss Fitzgerald won't be in your way.
Between us, once we marry

1308
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:51,120
she's retiring
whether she wants to or not.

1309
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:54,760
l'm not having a wife at work
in my own office.

1310
01:26:55,160 --> 01:26:59,280
Think positively. l'll be away
a few weeks, we're going to Paris.

1311
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:02,320
The actual city, or...?

1312
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:07,440
You need a vacation. Why not see if
you can get Laura Kensington to go?

1313
01:27:07,720 --> 01:27:09,800
l wouldn't mind that action myself.

1314
01:27:10,040 --> 01:27:13,160
She seemed struck by you.
She's a bit demented, but

1315
01:27:13,480 --> 01:27:15,800
in a hotel room,
that can be fun.

1316
01:27:21,080 --> 01:27:22,680
l came to say good-bye.

1317
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:25,640
Right. Chris and l have
a plane to catch.

1318
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:28,920
No. l mean l'm leaving.
l'm quitting.

1319
01:27:32,360 --> 01:27:35,320
lt should make you happy.
You can enjoy your vacation

1320
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:38,240
because when you come back,
you wont see me.

1321
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:40,720
You can revamp everything.
No static.

1322
01:27:43,720 --> 01:27:45,640
Want to have a parting drink?

1323
01:27:46,440 --> 01:27:48,360
At ten o'clock in the morning?

1324
01:27:50,040 --> 01:27:51,360
lt's only tequila.

1325
01:27:52,920 --> 01:27:57,080
What can you say about a woman who
keeps Mexican booze in her desk?

1326
01:27:57,880 --> 01:28:00,840
Let's drink to both
our futures.

1327
01:28:03,720 --> 01:28:06,640
Today, Mr. Magruder.
Tomorrow the world.

1328
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,920
l'll let that pass because
this is goodbye.

1329
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:14,160
You're really going to marry him.

1330
01:28:14,440 --> 01:28:16,160
For a brilliant woman

1331
01:28:16,440 --> 01:28:19,560
l've got to say you have
the worst taste in men.

1332
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:23,160
l didn't take up with you.
How bad could my taste be?

1333
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:27,760
You know behind those
nasty remarks...

1334
01:28:28,080 --> 01:28:30,960
is a very vulnerable, sweet,
sexy woman.

1335
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:33,600
But don't ever let that come out

1336
01:28:33,800 --> 01:28:37,520
because you could risk being happy.
And that would kill you.

1337
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:41,760
We will be happy. Your instinct
said he'd never leave his wife.

1338
01:28:42,120 --> 01:28:45,600
My instincts are good,
but they're not infallible.

1339
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:48,120
This was one where l was wrong.

1340
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:52,880
Have a terrific rest of your life
and try not to jump out of windows.

1341
01:28:53,560 --> 01:28:56,080
Be sure the elevator's there
before you get in.

1342
01:28:56,280 --> 01:28:59,360
One man plunged 1 5 stories and
wound up a vegetable.

1343
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,640
l'll let that pass,
'cause this is goodbye.

1344
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:10,760
Briggsie, l was just saying,
you quit, l go with you.

1345
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:14,320
C.W. you're our hero.
This was a tough nut to crack.

1346
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:16,920
No, this was all luck.

1347
01:29:17,240 --> 01:29:20,840
lf George didn't know hypnosis,
l wouldn't have known anything.

1348
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:22,720
lt's amazing.

1349
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:26,560
You can put someone under and force
them to do outrageous things.

1350
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:28,240
That's absolutely wrong.

1351
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:32,000
A hypnotized person won't do anything
they won't do in real life.

1352
01:29:32,240 --> 01:29:33,240
Really?

1353
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:36,280
Are you saying, at heart,
l'm a thief?

1354
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:40,400
We knew there was a little bit
of larceny in you.

1355
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:43,440
You always said
''lt takes one to catch one.''

1356
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:48,000
There was also a bit of larceny
in miss Fitzgerald. What a shock.

1357
01:29:48,360 --> 01:29:50,920
Turns out there are a lot of
surprises in her.

1358
01:29:51,160 --> 01:29:52,240
Come here.

1359
01:29:54,680 --> 01:29:56,440
You have a crush on her,
don't you?

1360
01:29:57,440 --> 01:30:00,640
Who? Fitzgerald?
What are you talking about?

1361
01:30:01,240 --> 01:30:02,640
l've always known it.

1362
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:06,560
You can't hate someone that much
without feeling some attraction.

1363
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:08,000
Says who?

1364
01:30:08,200 --> 01:30:12,440
My instinct. Come on, you were
the one who taught me to trust it.

1365
01:30:14,920 --> 01:30:16,280
l think l'm in love
with her.

1366
01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:20,320
lt's the stupidest thing
that's ever happened to me.

1367
01:30:20,600 --> 01:30:25,000
Take the bull by the horns.
She's leaving in about 3 minutes.

1368
01:30:30,440 --> 01:30:31,320
Go!

1369
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:39,280
Miss Fitzgerald,
marry me.

1370
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:43,520
l guess C.W.'s had a few.
Pretty early for that.

1371
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:47,200
l had some tequila or l wouldn't
be able to say this.

1372
01:30:47,480 --> 01:30:48,920
l love you. Marry me.

1373
01:30:49,200 --> 01:30:51,040
You embarrassing me.

1374
01:30:51,200 --> 01:30:54,720
You can't marry the wrong person,
when you love me.

1375
01:30:54,920 --> 01:30:56,560
You're making her uncomfortable.

1376
01:30:56,880 --> 01:31:01,280
What could make you think l could
think of you that way, you...

1377
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:06,000
l know. ''nearsighted cockroach''
Can't you see the venom under...

1378
01:31:06,520 --> 01:31:09,200
Betty, let's go.
C.W., leave here at once.

1379
01:31:09,480 --> 01:31:12,160
Your idea of moving on
wasn't so crazy.

1380
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:15,880
l'm opening up to you.
l'm putting my heart in your hands.

1381
01:31:16,120 --> 01:31:19,320
l was hard because l feared you,
like you feared me.

1382
01:31:19,560 --> 01:31:22,120
This is the real thing
and it terrifies us.

1383
01:31:22,360 --> 01:31:24,560
Yes, l fear you.
You and Boris Karloff.

1384
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:28,560
Your heroics do not entitle you
to be an obnoxious boor.

1385
01:31:28,840 --> 01:31:32,320
How is a man confessing love
be an obnoxious boor?

1386
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:35,920
Betty and l have a plans,
and they don't include you.

1387
01:31:36,200 --> 01:31:39,000
You want to spend your life
married to the wrong guy?

1388
01:31:39,280 --> 01:31:43,160
-Why would l marry you?
-Stop talking like l'm not here.

1389
01:31:43,480 --> 01:31:45,320
Because it's me you love.

1390
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:49,440
You're too old, too nearsighted
for me too short for me.

1391
01:31:49,680 --> 01:31:52,480
You left out the best part.
l'm losing my hair.

1392
01:31:52,720 --> 01:31:55,120
Goodbye, C.W.
And l mean for good.

1393
01:31:55,440 --> 01:31:59,000
Wait a minute.
Betty Ann, where are you going?

1394
01:31:59,880 --> 01:32:01,280
Madagascar?

1395
01:32:01,480 --> 01:32:03,760
Someone call the plane.
Say we might be late.

1396
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:07,320
You go ahead, Chris.

1397
01:32:08,840 --> 01:32:10,640
l'm staying here.

1398
01:32:13,160 --> 01:32:15,600
l'm staying with C.W.

1399
01:32:16,280 --> 01:32:18,360
We have an announcement
to make.

1400
01:32:20,040 --> 01:32:23,400
Betty Ann, You have
a crazy look in your eye.

1401
01:32:23,720 --> 01:32:26,120
l've never felt so normal
in my life.

1402
01:32:26,520 --> 01:32:30,280
l can't guarantee every time
l kiss you there'll be fireworks.

1403
01:32:30,640 --> 01:32:34,160
l fell in love the second
l saw you.

1404
01:32:34,440 --> 01:32:37,120
l want this woman helped!
Get an ambulance.

1405
01:32:37,440 --> 01:32:41,440
Call my wife's attorney!
Have them halt the separation!

1406
01:32:42,440 --> 01:32:46,360
She'll take you back, with some
new ground rules, but you'll adapt.

1407
01:32:46,920 --> 01:32:49,960
So much passion
in a lousy insurance office.

1408
01:32:53,960 --> 01:32:55,200
Congratulations.

1409
01:32:56,720 --> 01:32:59,040
A little going-away
present for you.

1410
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:03,520
Should we get out of here

1411
01:33:04,160 --> 01:33:07,960
and find somewhere to start
making up for lost time?

1412
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:10,240
How about my place?

1413
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:13,160
l think l can live with that.

1414
01:33:13,960 --> 01:33:18,240
God bless everyone.
And God bless Tiny Tim.

1415
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:19,720
Shall we?

1416
01:33:20,120 --> 01:33:21,680
Good luck, you two.

1417
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:26,720
What'll happen when she wakes
up and is back to her old self?

1418
01:33:27,480 --> 01:33:30,560
He'll have to say ''Madagascar''
first thing every morning.

1419
01:33:30,920 --> 01:33:33,400
My gosh, who'd have thunk it?

1420
01:33:33,680 --> 01:33:37,680
What a break for C.W. that you
forgot to deprogram Miss Fitzgerald.

1421
01:33:38,360 --> 01:33:41,920
What are you saying?
l deprogrammed her last night.

1422
01:33:43,800 --> 01:33:47,040
You don't have to worry.
l'll never leave you.

1423
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:49,680
Tell me how you feel about me.

1424
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:52,400
You're the most wonderful man
in the world.

1425
01:33:52,840 --> 01:33:55,600
The handsomest, the most brilliant,
the sexiest.

1426
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:59,640
Someday l'm going to make you
really feel those things.

1427
01:34:00,080 --> 01:34:02,000
Anything's possible.

1428
01:34:02,280 --> 01:34:05,800
l made you feel that way and l
didn't have to say ''Constantinople''.

1429
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:07,480
That's right!

1430
01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:18,480
