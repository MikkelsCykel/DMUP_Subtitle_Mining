1
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,480
<i>Live, until they drop dead...</i>

2
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,000
<i>...from the beautiful
Carlou Theater...</i>

3
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,320
<i>...in the heart of sunny
Miami Beach, Florida...</i>

4
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,320
<i>...it's the Veterans Day
Polio Telethon!</i>

5
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,960
<i>And now, please
welcome your hosts...</i>

6
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,200
<i>...the beautiful, the talented,
Lanny Morris...</i>

7
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,200
<i>...and Vince Collins!</i>

8
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,640
Do you realize
we have to present ourselves...

9
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,280
...in front of these lovely
people for the next three days?

10
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,680
Hello, lovely people
for the next three days.

11
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,680
-Look at you. You're a disgrace.
-What?

12
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,360
Look, your hair's a mess, your shoes
aren't shined, your shirt's not pressed.

13
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,440
-Look at your tie. It's not even straight.
-Look at yours. It doesn't even clip on.

14
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,960
Now...

15
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,800
...I'm upset.

16
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,600
You know what
happens when I get upset.

17
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,280
No, no, no. Please.
Please don't hurt me, Vince.

18
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,520
I've had a terrible day already.
All sorts of bad things have happened.

19
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,920
I don't wanna be hurt again.

20
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,520
-You've been hurt already, have you?
-Been hurt real bad.

21
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,880
And what happened,
pray tell?

22
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,800
-Want me to pray or want me to tell?
-I think you better pray.

23
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,560
<i>-I saw this stranger
-I don't know whether you're...</i>

24
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,880
<i>-... singing or speaking.
-Leave my pad</i>

25
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,480
<i>-One thing I do know...
-And I said, "Baby...</i>

26
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,560
<i>-... what explanation do you have?"
-There's always a woman involved.</i>

27
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,040
<i>And she said:</i>

28
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,960
<i>-Next time?
-Next time</i>

29
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,320
<i>And I said, "There will be
No next time"</i>

30
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,480
That's what you said last time,
Lanny, and the time before that.

31
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,720
You have to make sure there's no first
time, then there can't be a next time.

32
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,240
Or a last time.

33
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,000
<i>-That was the last time for me
-Let's hope so, Lanny.</i>

34
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,000
Lanny Morris,
ladies and gentlemen.

35
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,040
My manager sent me over
some of your work.

36
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,400
It's funny how you're
really in them a lot.

37
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,280
Whenever I read these
interviews where the writer says:

38
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,320
"This is how I felt the morning
I woke up to meet the pope"...

39
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,200
..."how I felt when the pope greeted
me, how he reminded me...

40
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,760
...so much of my friend Mike"...

41
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,520
...I always think,
"Who the fuck is Mike?"

42
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,840
So who are you?

43
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,760
<i>I was a young journalist...</i>

44
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,360
<i>...with a few awards...</i>

45
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,560
<i>...a couple of cover stories...</i>

46
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,600
<i>...and a desperate need
to prove myself.</i>

47
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,560
If you look through my work,
you'll see I try to present...

48
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,400
...a balanced view of my subjects.

49
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,440
I leave the conclusions
to the reader.

50
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,880
I'm not sure we like balance.

51
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,800
Or leaving
the conclusions to the reader.

52
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,800
I'm used to being publicized,
not analyzed.

53
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,360
It would be your words.

54
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,800
We'd publish it as a transcript:

55
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,480
My questions, your answers.

56
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,200
If you say it, I can use it.

57
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,680
If you don't, I can't.

58
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,680
And they're gonna pay me
a million for this?

59
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,160
An excerpt will be published
in a magazine as a way...

60
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,560
...of amortizing the investment
they'll be making in the book.

61
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,360
They're looking for some...

62
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,320
...provocative stories
for the first issue.

63
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,600
Any thoughts on what these
provocative stories might be about?

64
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,120
The breakup.
Why Lanny and you split.

65
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,080
And the girl.

66
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,000
Maureen.

67
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,320
What happened
to Maureen O'Flaherty.

68
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,800
<i>No one had ever been able
to pin Lanny Morris...</i>

69
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,280
<i>...or Vince Collins
to the girl's death.</i>

70
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,080
<i>All that was clear...</i>

71
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,760
<i>...was that Maureen was
found dead in their hotel suite.</i>

72
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,760
<i>It was unthinkable to me
that Lanny and Vince...</i>

73
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,680
<i>...could have had
anything to do with it.</i>

74
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,760
<i>They were my heroes.</i>

75
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,240
"The reason I consider
myself to be a miracle girl...

76
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,160
...is because
I had the good fortune...

77
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,880
...to meet Lanny and Vince
when I was sick.

78
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,560
Their love of life
is what gave me hope...

79
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:39,120
...and it's hope
that gives us the power to live. "

80
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,840
Thank you, Lanny.

81
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,920
Thank you, Vince.

82
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,760
Come on, let's hear it for her.

83
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,160
<i>Denise handled publicity
for the polio foundation.</i>

84
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,600
<i>And it was her idea to plug
the girl's story on the telethon.</i>

85
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:12,600
<i>The day before, it was my idea to plug
Denise at the Miami Versailles Hotel.</i>

86
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,880
Don't stop! Don't stop!

87
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,080
Don't stop!

88
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,080
<i>You can tell a lot about a woman
by the way she acts...</i>

89
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,760
<i>...when you're having sex
and room service comes in.</i>

90
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,960
<i>Some girls will sit up
and light a cigarette...</i>

91
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,880
<i>...like there's nothing funny
in the world about her being naked.</i>

92
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,280
<i>"It's obvious we were
in the process of screwing...</i>

93
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,360
<i>...so why not let
a stranger into the room?"</i>

94
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,760
Come on in.

95
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,320
<i>Then there's the kind that will
pull the sheets up...</i>

96
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,000
<i>...and act like they're asleep.</i>

97
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,120
Where would you like it, sir?

98
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,000
Sweetheart, wherever you'd like it.

99
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,720
<i>Then, of course, there's
the ones who scrunch real flat...</i>

100
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,720
<i>...thinking that the bed
will look empty.</i>

101
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,320
<i>With Denise, it was kind of hard
to tell which way she'd go.</i>

102
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,400
Can I have your autograph,
Mr. Morris?

103
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,200
Sure.

104
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,280
Should I make it out to Maureen?

105
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,440
I mean, your autograph on the bill.

106
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,360
Okay.

107
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,200
I mean, I'd love
to have your autograph.

108
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,880
And maybe a few minutes
of your time.

109
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,800
I'm a huge fan and...

110
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,120
...well, I was thinking about...

111
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,240
...writing an article on you
for my campus paper.

112
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,800
I'm the editor.

113
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,080
Any interview requests
go through me, honey.

114
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,960
You know, it's just a college paper.

115
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,640
Thank you.

116
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,040
No, thank you.

117
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,680
Thank you, Maureen.

118
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,520
<i>I say goodbye to Maureen,
knowing I'd see her again...</i>

119
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,880
<i>...close the door and
then turn to look at Denise...</i>

120
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,880
<i>...thinking, "I know this girl from every
college town we have ever played. "</i>

121
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,400
<i>They're called career girls.</i>

122
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,760
<i>The absolute easiest lays...</i>

123
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,640
<i>...in this great nation of ours.</i>

124
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,400
<i>Since you're reading this,
you'd be interested to know...</i>

125
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,800
<i>...that my favorite catches
were the intellectuals.</i>

126
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,960
<i>They'd be the ones in the straight
black dresses, severe black hair.</i>

127
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,200
<i>Your basic neurotic,
eyeglasses, cool jazz, liberal...</i>

128
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,960
<i>..."I'll fuck any black guy as
part of my personal apology...</i>

129
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,320
<i>...for racism in America" type.</i>

130
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,720
<i>Anyhow, on this particular night,
we're in a club in New Jersey...</i>

131
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,320
<i>...it's the '50s, and I'm mingling
with the crowd.</i>

132
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,760
<i>Now, when I say "mingling, "
what I mean is...</i>

133
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,880
<i>...I was scouting
for who I would sleep with.</i>

134
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,120
<i>Didn't matter if the girls
came with dates.</i>

135
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,440
<i>That was Reuben's job.
Reuben is my valet.</i>

136
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,320
<i>I never figured out how he
helped them get rid of their dates...</i>

137
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,800
<i>...but they were always gone
by the second show.</i>

138
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,000
<i>Reuben could clean up
any situation.</i>

139
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,000
Excuse me, miss.
May I say that I think...

140
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,240
...you have the most beautiful eyes
I have ever seen.

141
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,760
Notice I say, "I think you've got the
most beautiful eyes I've ever seen. "

142
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,520
I haven't seen them yet.
I've been staring at your cans.

143
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,920
Now, Lanny.

144
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,720
-I can't believe he just said that.
-That is completely unacceptable.

145
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,240
Madam, I apologize.
I apologize, ladies and gentlemen...

146
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,080
...for my friend. You cannot
speak that way to a stranger.

147
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,480
Look, her husband's not offended.

148
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,560
-He's not?
-No, her husband's not offended.

149
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,160
Her husband's not here.
This lucky guy is her boyfriend.

150
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,680
And even he's not offended,
and do you know why?

151
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,600
Well, I can certainly hazard a guess.

152
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,560
What the hell is that? For chrissake,
Vince, this is America.

153
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,160
We don't say, "hazard a guess. "
We say "yes" or we say "no. "

154
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,960
Well, I say "no" to you, Morris.

155
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,600
Excuse me?
Could you repeat that?

156
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,920
I don't think
the entire audience heard you.

157
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,520
Go back to where
you came from, bastard!

158
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,400
<i>I get hecklers all the time,
but this schmuck came off personal.</i>

159
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,880
<i>Where did he think I came from?</i>

160
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,120
Bastard! Bastard!
He called me a bastard.

161
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,160
Now, it doesn't show
from the front, Lanny.

162
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,720
Now, please, would you kindly not
mount me? It's very disagreeable.

163
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,080
<i>Vince plunges straight into
quoting lines I wrote...</i>

164
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,200
<i>...from a song
from our first motion picture.</i>

165
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,200
<i>I happen to be honored
to work with this jerk</i>

166
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,320
Is that a compliment?

167
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,000
<i>I never frown with this clown</i>

168
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,120
Never, never, never.

169
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,520
<i>I get a kick from this...</i>

170
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,600
<i>...friend of mine</i>

171
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,080
Fine, but don't give
the mike to this kike.

172
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,360
-Well...
-Just relax.

173
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:52,520
It's not often we get topped by
a member of our audience, but...

174
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,440
...this gentleman has
done the impossible.

175
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,320
What is your name?

176
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,840
-It's Joe.
-Joe...

177
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,120
...we were just wondering
if you'd be a great sport...

178
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,520
...and help us out on stage.
What do you say, folks?

179
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,160
Go on.

180
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,280
Joe here is going to play
a crazy high school professor...

181
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,720
...who's about to give Lanny
and I our final high school exam.

182
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,600
So if you'll just excuse us while
we help Joe change into his...

183
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,000
...crazy-professor outfit.

184
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,200
Lanny, a little
costume-changing music...

185
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,280
...if you please.

186
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,440
Step this way.

187
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,520
I'll have a word with him...

188
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,440
...about the way
he spoke to your wife.

189
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,160
Completely unnecessary.

190
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,960
Just this way.

191
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,360
You call any Jew on this planet
anything you like.

192
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:10,040
But nobody calls my partner a kike.
Do you understand?

193
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,600
<i>Boffing ladies and
bashing gentlemen.</i>

194
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,280
<i>I tell you, there was
nothing under the sun...</i>

195
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,120
<i>...Vince and I wouldn't do
for each other.</i>

196
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,120
Are you finished?

197
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,560
Thank you, Mamie.

198
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,520
I'm sorry about that, Miss O'Connor.

199
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,760
We just needed to be sure
you didn't take any notes.

200
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,960
Lanny gave me very specific
instructions on that point.

201
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,440
I don't understand why
he'd want me to read this.

202
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,400
Why would he ever want
anyone to see this side of him?

203
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,160
When you contacted us about
meeting Lanny for your book...

204
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:12,000
...it wasn't simply about letting you
know he didn't want to speak with you.

205
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:15,520
I believe my client wanted you
to understand that he, in fact...

206
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,080
...was completing a book
of his own which would serve...

207
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,040
...not only as his autobiography...

208
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,040
...but also as the definitive account of
the joint careers of Morris and Collins.

209
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,000
You've had, at first hand,
a sample of Lanny's writing voice.

210
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,280
Yes, I have.

211
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,160
Such a book, Miss O'Connor...

212
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,720
...this raw, this honest...

213
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,000
...would make your own efforts look-

214
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,480
There's been some very nice...

215
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:41,080
...translations of the Bible
over the centuries...

216
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,080
...but they would run
a very poor second in popularity...

217
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,880
...to the discovery
of the actual Ten Commandments.

218
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,400
Single best part about teaching
grade two is the difference...

219
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,240
...between the bright ones and
the dumb ones isn't so obvious.

220
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,720
-What's so great about that?
-The results of my work...

221
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,440
...as a teacher
aren't so depressing.

222
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:02,120
Also, there's no homework
to correct in the evenings and...

223
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,800
...well, none of the kids
know how to use drugs.

224
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,640
<i>Bonnie had come from New York
to visit me that summer.</i>

225
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,280
<i>We'd been best friends
since kindergarten.</i>

226
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,280
<i>At school we started the
Lanny and Vince Fan Club...</i>

227
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,520
<i>...raising almost $200
for that year's telethon.</i>

228
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,480
All of you send in
a bit of your allowance.

229
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,680
Just a little bit.
A dime, a nickel, a penny.

230
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,320
Every bit helps.

231
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,280
<i>The goal of the telethon that year...</i>

232
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,600
<i>...was $3.9 million, which was
a lot of dough at that time.</i>

233
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,400
Thank you, Tom.
You're a prince among men.

234
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,960
Whoa, Lanny. There are
children watching!

235
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,600
Where does he get his energy?

236
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,520
<i>To remind viewers of the goal...</i>

237
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,640
<i>...we agreed the telethon
could run 39 hours nonstop.</i>

238
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,600
<i>The show would begin at 9 p. m. on
Friday and finish at noon on Sunday.</i>

239
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,040
<i>We paced it so that
Vince and I were together...</i>

240
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,240
<i>...for the kickoff,
most of the day Saturday...</i>

241
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,800
<i>...then the big finale
on Sunday with us bleary-eyed...</i>

242
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,800
<i>...and weeping as America
got ready to go to church.</i>

243
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,200
Lanny, Lanny. What are you doing?

244
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,680
I'm ordering a pizza. I'm starving.

245
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,440
No anchovies on mine, Lanny.
Hey, so who are you talking to?

246
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:21,680
I'm talking to little Suzie
from Whittier, California...

247
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:25,240
...and she is going to donate
three weeks of allowance.

248
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,480
-How about that, folks?
-Suzie from Whittier, thank you.

249
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,080
Three weeks of allowance.

250
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,640
That's a challenge for all you-

251
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,960
<i>What you have to understand
is that Vince and me...</i>

252
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,240
<i>...were essentially a boy-girl act.</i>

253
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,920
<i>I was the tramp,
ready for any sort of action...</i>

254
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,640
<i>...and Vince was the gentleman...</i>

255
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,880
<i>...always trying to make me
behave myself.</i>

256
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,440
<i>I was pleasure, and he was control.</i>

257
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,720
<i>I was rock 'n' roll,
and he was class.</i>

258
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:53,080
<i>His presence gave America
permission to like me.</i>

259
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,320
<i>My deal with the publisher
gave me first-class travel...</i>

260
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,000
<i>...a luxury I'd never enjoyed.</i>

261
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,480
Is there any chance of switching
to a window seat?

262
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,840
Sorry, we're completely booked
in first.

263
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,920
But these center seats
are really wonderful. See...

264
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,120
...if you push here-
Can I show you?

265
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,000
Sure.

266
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,160
The chair swivels
to the left and the right.

267
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,560
And this converts
to a full-sized dining table...

268
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,440
...during our
Pan Am platinum service...

269
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,080
...with damask linen
and silverware by Fornari...

270
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,440
...so you don't have to eat off a tray.

271
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,200
Again, that's only
for these center seats.

272
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,360
How does that sound?

273
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,240
<i>At that time, when you
traveled first class...</i>

274
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,360
<i>...people would always ask you if you
met someone famous on the flight.</i>

275
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,440
-Mr. Morris.
-Thank you.

276
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,720
You're welcome.

277
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:54,080
<i>Though he would later accuse me
of engineering this, I didn't.</i>

278
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,560
<i>It just...</i>

279
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,400
<i>...happened.</i>

280
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,400
Reuben. So they-
They record these songs...

281
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,240
...in a studio that I am paying for.

282
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,200
Songs that are recorded for me...

283
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,040
...that they are
contracted to provide.

284
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,120
-Are you with me here?
-Yes, it's just that-

285
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:17,360
No, it's just that nothing, Irv.
Please, let me finish. They record...

286
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:20,880
<i>I read an interview where Lanny was
given credit for insisting his butler...</i>

287
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,760
<i>...travel in the same class and stay
at the same hotels as his boss.</i>

288
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,600
<i>The valet's attentiveness
was impressive.</i>

289
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,720
Looks like you'll be having
dinner with Lanny Morris.

290
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,280
-Hello.
-Hi.

291
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,880
We should get a waiter to slide
a matchbook under the airplane.

292
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,480
There we go.

293
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,320
That should hold.

294
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,960
This is my friend Reuben.

295
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,320
-Hi.
-Hi.

296
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,960
And this is also my friend,
technically speaking...

297
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,080
-... and business manager, Irv.
-Hi.

298
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,400
My name is Lanny.

299
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,480
And what's your name?

300
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,960
Bonnie. Bonnie Trout.

301
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,440
What do you do, Bonnie?

302
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,120
I teach.

303
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,880
And what do you teach?

304
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,200
-Second grade.
-Well, we have a lot in common.

305
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,800
You teach second grade,
I went to second grade.

306
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,040
-Irv, you went to second grade too?
-Many times.

307
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,640
Tell me, Miss Trout-

308
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,200
I don't mean to be impolite...

309
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,920
...but I was wondering...

310
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,520
...how a second-grade schoolteacher
affords to fly first class.

311
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,680
Well, I have a pass...

312
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,200
...that allows me free use
of the subway on weekends...

313
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,440
...and the hot lunches
at school are only 50 cents.

314
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,120
And I'm the mistress...

315
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,720
...of a wealthy married man...

316
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,440
...and when he and his wife
go on vacation, he treats me...

317
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,680
...to a first-class trip
in the opposite direction.

318
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:05,720
But look at me, talking only about
myself. What do you do for a living?

319
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,440
I'm a French impressionist
painter out of Tahiti, mainly.

320
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,960
I'm doing that to pay the bills.
My ambition is to be...

321
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,120
...a stockbroker in Paris.

322
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,000
-I don't get it.
-Paul Gauguin.

323
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,080
He gave up being
a successful stockbroker...

324
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,600
...to become a painter
in the South Seas.

325
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,360
You think the average
person knows that?

326
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,760
Well, we're not talking about
the average person, Irv.

327
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,200
<i>In some ways...</i>

328
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,440
<i>...he had never stopped
being a hero to me.</i>

329
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,240
<i>That's why it was impossible
to think he might also be a killer.</i>

330
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,160
Well, this has been great.

331
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,400
I'm gonna see you
inside your apartment.

332
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,960
-There's really no need.
-Don't be silly.

333
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,920
I'm not gonna try to come in.

334
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,560
Promise.

335
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,800
You've been away from your
apartment for how long now?

336
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,600
-Ages.
-You never know if somebody's...

337
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,320
...broken in while you were gone.

338
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,080
I'll just see you inside your door.

339
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,520
Believe me, I'm-
I'm not trying to seduce you.

340
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,600
<i>I have to do the Today show
at 7 a. m.</i>

341
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,080
They want me in Makeup at 6:15.

342
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,440
<i>Bonnie had moved to New York
for the teaching job...</i>

343
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,520
<i>...a little over a year ago.</i>

344
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:21,600
<i>I had never visited her and had
no idea if this was the right place.</i>

345
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,200
Which floor?

346
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,560
Why...

347
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,840
-Four-D.
-Forty?

348
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,120
It only goes up to six.

349
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,040
Four-D-

350
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,360
Four-D, the fourth floor.

351
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,680
Which way?

352
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,400
-Guess.
-Why?

353
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,800
It's a test.

354
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,440
A test?

355
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,680
Okay.

356
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,240
This way.

357
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,840
So why didn't we take this elevator?

358
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,600
Doesn't work.

359
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,120
Well...

360
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,240
...good night.

361
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,320
No, I'm going to see you
into your apartment.

362
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,920
And then I'm gonna leave you
alone until tomorrow.

363
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,240
I never get which key goes in
which lock the first time.

364
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,880
Hey, looks like they fixed it.

365
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,200
You okay?

366
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,720
Maybe we should turn on a light.

367
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,160
Well...

368
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,760
I'm going to leave you now.

369
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,160
I have Reuben and Irv waiting
in the limousine downstairs...

370
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,440
<i>...and I should get some sleep
for the Today show.</i>

371
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,960
So...

372
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,680
It was lovely to meet you, Bonnie.

373
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,520
<i>By the end of the telethon,
we had no voices.</i>

374
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:07,160
<i>Thirty-nine hours
of nonstop entertainment.</i>

375
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,080
<i>A telethon was a superhuman feat.</i>

376
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:13,600
<i>We weren't just heroes,
we were gods.</i>

377
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,960
<i>A couple of the boys were there
to make sure we got out alive...</i>

378
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,400
<i>...to make the flight to New York.</i>

379
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,920
Everyone. Listen. Listen.

380
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,120
Gentlemen. Gentlemen, please.

381
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:33,440
Gentlemen, if I could just
have your attention.

382
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,560
Everyone, Mr. Collins
and Mr. Morris...

383
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,920
...will answer questions
at the press conference...

384
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,720
...at the Palace Del Sol.

385
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,840
Gentlemen, there will be
plenty of time...

386
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,320
...to answer your questions
at the Palace Del Sol.

387
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,480
Thank you, we will answer your
questions at the press conference.

388
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,560
Thank you for coming.

389
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,200
<i>We had a full police escort, along
with bodyguards who were there...</i>

390
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,160
<i>...to protect us from any thoughts
we might have of going AWOL...</i>

391
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,040
<i>...prior to this press conference.</i>

392
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,240
<i>A pair of New Jersey's finest
walked on either side of us...</i>

393
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,920
<i>...as we entered
the lobby of the hotel.</i>

394
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,720
<i>It was an indication of how
legitimate the Mob had gone...</i>

395
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,040
<i>...that they could
bring in the local police...</i>

396
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,600
<i>...to guard the façade of their racket.</i>

397
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:22,120
<i>The local chief was a man
named Jack Scaglia.</i>

398
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,080
And of course, the two
gentlemen on my right...

399
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:28,440
...who need no introduction,
have come here directly...

400
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,160
...from their record-breaking
polio telethon in Miami, Florida.

401
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,480
So the first thing I'd like to announce
is that Mr. Sanmarco...

402
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,160
<i>I wish I could tell you...</i>

403
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,840
<i>...that Sally Sanmarco
was a slim, 6-foot-6 guy...</i>

404
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,880
<i>...who looked like a prince
and spoke with an English accent.</i>

405
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,360
<i>Then I wouldn't be
falling back on the stereotype.</i>

406
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,080
<i>The trouble was, Sally was
straight out of central casting.</i>

407
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,800
<i>A gangster
who looked and talked...</i>

408
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,560
<i>...just like you would expect
from the movies.</i>

409
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,240
How did it feel to raise
all that money for polio?

410
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,840
It felt great. It felt really great.

411
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,800
<i>From a publicity angle, and in
terms of giving him legitimacy...</i>

412
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,120
<i>...this was a huge coup for Sally.</i>

413
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,720
<i>Like I said, we were gods.</i>

414
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:13,400
<i>We'd only been in the New York area
for an hour or so, during which time...</i>

415
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,240
<i>...we were constantly watched
by police and reporters...</i>

416
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:19,080
<i>...which ended up being
a good thing for us.</i>

417
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,600
We got you our best bridal suite.

418
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,000
Fucking nice, huh?

419
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,680
People talk about having fancy
apartments and hotel rooms...

420
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,880
...on the West Side of Manhattan.
What do they see?

421
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,120
Fucking New Jersey.
Here, you see New York City.

422
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,400
<i>Unfortunately,
Vince and I were acquainted...</i>

423
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:46,720
<i>...with the dead girl in the bathroom
of our hotel suite in New Jersey.</i>

424
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:50,320
<i>Her last name was O'Flaherty.</i>

425
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:53,760
<i>Her first name was Maureen.</i>

426
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,480
<i>Karen, we decided to trade
apartments, not identities.</i>

427
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,160
<i>Why didn't you make up a name?</i>

428
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,760
Bonnie, I was looking
at a five-hour flight.

429
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I didn't wanna make up a life story
that wasn't attached to anything.

430
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,520
Well, I returned the offense.
I got to pretend I was you.

431
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,240
<i>-What?
-You received a package.</i>

432
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,640
Messenger service.
I signed your name.

433
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,360
-Who's it from?
-No address. Want me to open it?

434
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,000
-Sure.
-That's good. I already did.

435
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,440
It's a manuscript.

436
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,960
"Excerpt From the Memoirs of...

437
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,840
...Lanny Morris. "

438
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:26,880
Hey, all your dreams are coming true.
He's writing you love letters already.

439
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,960
Bonnie, I need
to know what he's written.

440
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:32,960
-Well, I'll send it to you.
-Now. Before he calls me tomorrow.

441
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,920
-Please?
-All right.

442
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,000
All right.

443
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,600
Here we go.

444
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,640
"Let me explain to you why two
very famous guys just finishing...

445
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:52,800
...a nationally broadcast telethon
ended up in New Jersey. "

446
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:02,240
<i>For years, the Palace Del Sol was
one of the centers of Mob prosperity.</i>

447
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,280
<i>Needless to say, a major
headliner in the showroom...</i>

448
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,520
<i>...helped legitimize
the entire operation.</i>

449
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,400
Give her a kiss. Yeah, beautiful.

450
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,480
One more, guys. That's it.
That's great. Thank you.

451
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:16,040
<i>Vince and I needed help

<i>It wasn't "serious" serious.
It was like running a red light.</i>

455
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:29,240
<i>Everyone used bennies. Vince added
them to his morning coffee like sugar.</i>

456
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
<i>Not that you could tell.</i>

457
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,640
<i>When we did finally
decide to flatten out...</i>

458
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,640
<i>...we'd take two or three Tuinals,
or three or four "Threeinals. "</i>

459
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,080
<i>They were really good.</i>

460
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,480
<i>Between the moment you took them
and passing out...</i>

461
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,720
<i>...it felt really sexy.</i>

462
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:25,960
Sure.

463
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,200
-Enjoyed the show.
-Thank you.

464
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,320
<i>The walls of the Blue Grotto...</i>

465
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:37,080
<i>...were made of a mixture
of plaster and Styrofoam.</i>

466
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:40,040
<i>Flammable as all hell. But the boys
had learned it was cheaper...</i>

467
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,520
<i>...to give the inspector 200 bucks
and a ringside table to our show...</i>

468
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,840
<i>...than to spend thousands
of dollars on fireproofing.</i>

469
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:50,120
<i>Besides, it was always vital in
a business enterprise of this sort...</i>

470
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,880
<i>...to have the option to torch the place
at a moment's notice...</i>

471
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,360
<i>...should the need present itself.</i>

472
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,320
<i>One night, after our show,
we were taken to Sally's office.</i>

473
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,040
<i>We wondered
what we had done wrong...</i>

474
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,800
<i>...but what we had done
was done good.</i>

475
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,160
<i>Sally started going on about
how much he liked us...</i>

476
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,000
<i>...how he thought we were
a good fit with his crowd...</i>

477
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,840
<i>...meaning that we brought in
an audience of heavy drinkers...</i>

478
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,800
<i>...adulterers and gamblers.</i>

479
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,400
So, what we want is for you boys
to come back here...

480
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,280
...three months from now
and open our new showroom for us.

481
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,080
A two-week,
exclusive limited engagement...

482
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:27,080
...that we want you to do for us
for six weeks.

483
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,080
<i>God help you when a killer
takes a shining to you.</i>

484
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:35,000
<i>I looked at Vince and scratched my
nose, which meant our strongest "no. "</i>

485
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,840
That's a very great honor, Sally.

486
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,440
-You're damn fucking right it is.
-The thing is...

487
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,560
...we're just trying to cut down on
the nightclub work at the moment.

488
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,240
We turned down the Sands
so we could do a TV special...

489
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,280
...and the only reason we still work the
Versailles is out of friendship for you.

490
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:56,080
-What dates were you thinking of?
-We open November 15th.

491
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,760
Sally, any other day
we would be here in a flash...

492
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,880
...but, you know, that's the day
right after the next polio telethon.

493
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,000
I mean, we always take two weeks off
right after that to recover.

494
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,360
-Right, Vince?
-At least.

495
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,560
-I mean, we're tired.
-That's the way I want you.

496
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:12,240
After the fucking telethon,
we fly you up from Miami...

497
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:15,040
...hold a press conference,
all fucking exhausted...

498
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,120
...so people know
what heroes you are.

499
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,520
I'll keep a suite for you
with the best hookers I got.

500
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,720
Your own personal cathouse.

501
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,320
And I'll have them send you up...

502
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,360
...a shipment of lobsters
and stone crabs.

503
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,880
-You like lobsters?
-Love them.

504
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,720
And a case of these...

505
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,440
...special grapefruits...

506
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:36,360
...that I get special down there.

507
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:39,560
The most delicious thing
you ever tasted in your life.

508
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,920
Juicy, thin skin.

509
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:46,280
<i>Months later, on the night
before the telethon in Miami...</i>

510
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,760
<i>...we got back to our room
and found that Sally...</i>

511
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,040
<i>...had been more than good
to his word.</i>

512
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,360
<i>Laid out around the room
were various crates...</i>

513
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,920
<i>...bearing the addresses
of their destination:</i>

514
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,360
<i>Our suite at the Palace Del Sol
hotel in New Jersey.</i>

515
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:07,360
"You like lobsters?
See you in New Jersey. "

516
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,400
"Thin skin, fucking most delicious
fucking thing...

517
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,200
...you ever had in your fucking life. "

518
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,080
"What I thought was a box
of beach balls turned out to be...

519
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,440
...the thinnest-skinned,
dripping-wet grapefruits...

520
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,200
...I'd ever tasted in my life.

521
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,880
The 6-foot crate was filled
with fruits of the sea...

522
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,800
...slowly shifting over a bed of ice. "

523
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,440
Yeah, this is Lanny Morris.
Send up three steaks, all right?

524
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,920
Yeah. Make them rare this time.

525
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,360
-Yeah, rare.
-Like bloody.

526
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:35,720
Bloody. And a couple of bottles
of that champagne.

527
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,800
-Make that three.
-Three bottles of champagne.

528
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,240
And can you make sure
that Maureen delivers them?

529
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,000
Yeah, Maureen.

530
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,920
<i>We called down for Maureen...</i>

531
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,880
<i>...the room-service girl
I'd met earlier...</i>

532
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,440
<i>...who wanted the interview
for her school paper.</i>

533
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:52,160
<i>She brought up three steaks,
one for her...</i>

534
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:55,080
<i>...as her last official delivery
of the day.</i>

535
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,760
<i>As much as I love lobster...</i>

536
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,880
<i>...seeing all that shellfish
nestled on ice in the crate...</i>

537
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,880
<i>...put me in the mood
for hooves, not claws.</i>

538
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:25,440
<i>The interview for Maureen's campus
paper went better than expected.</i>

539
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,760
<i>Vince and I popped some Tuinals...</i>

540
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,160
<i>...to insure that
we would sleep like babes...</i>

541
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:35,040
<i>...after we wore off the general
horniness that the pills first give you.</i>

542
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:40,840
<i>Vince bought insurance on his bet
by having a few babes on hand.</i>

543
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:44,080
<i>Well, not exactly on his hand.</i>

544
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,600
<i>That wasn't his preference.</i>

545
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:49,040
"Not exactly on his hand.
That wasn't his preference. "

546
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:54,160
"Not exactly on his hand"?
"That wasn't his preference"?

547
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,640
"The Tuinals, coupled with
a nice amount of booze...

548
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,280
...guaranteed us
the sleep of the dead.

549
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,840
Late the next morning,
Maureen was sent packing...

550
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:08,720
...and Vince and I prepared ourselves
for that night's broadcast. "

551
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:13,120
Well, I guess this is one story my kids
won't have to give a book report on.

552
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,560
Thanks.

553
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,920
Must be weird to find out...

554
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:22,680
...that the object of all your
adolescent fantasies is a pig.

555
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,560
He's not like that.

556
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:30,280
Oh, so it's just the way
he describes himself.

557
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,760
<i>She was right.</i>

558
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,360
<i>Which was the real Lanny?</i>

559
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,840
<i>I'd find out later that the story
of the hookers in the hotel suite...</i>

560
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,400
<i>...was a complete fabrication.</i>

561
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,200
<i>That night, Maureen was alone.</i>

562
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,440
<i>-Hello?
-So how did you like the show?</i>

563
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,080
<i>Lanny?</i>

564
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,760
<i>The Today show.</i>

565
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,280
You did watch, didn't you?

566
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,400
<i>-The show.
-You didn't watch.</i>

567
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,640
<i>Wow, that's scary.</i>

568
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,240
You see, when you're a star...

569
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:33,320
...you live in terror,
wondering if it's all over yet.

570
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,280
You keep looking for the signs.

571
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:38,440
You're shooting a scene from a movie
on a New York street...

572
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:39,760
...and a crowd doesn't form.

573
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,680
You meet a girl on a plane
and tell her...

574
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,440
<i>...that you're gonna be on the
Today show the next morning...</i>

575
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:47,280
...and she doesn't
wake up early to watch.

576
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,160
It's very scary.

577
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,840
Hey, you know,
I mentioned you on the air.

578
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,760
<i>-You did?
-Yes, I proposed to you on the air.</i>

579
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,720
Your building is probably
surrounded with photographers...

580
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,480
<i>-... at this very moment.
-You're kidding.</i>

581
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:05,480
Yes, I'm kidding.

582
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,240
So...

583
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,520
...what time would you like to meet?

584
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,440
Stanley, this is Bonnie.
Bonnie, Stanley.

585
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,040
Nice to meet you.

586
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,560
Is the food almost ready, Stan?

587
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,560
Yeah. I'll bring it right out,
Mr. Lanny.

588
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,480
I was very hungry, so I asked Stanley
to prepare us something special.

589
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,600
That sounds great.

590
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,840
Tell me, what kind of a meeting...

591
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,800
...does a schoolteacher have to go to
during the summer vacation?

592
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,960
I'm exploring the possibility
of another job.

593
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:02,640
-Something in publishing.
-How did it go?

594
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,240
Okay.

595
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,240
Have you ever thought
about writing a book?

596
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,840
-About what?
-Your life.

597
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,760
Sure. When I'm dead.

598
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,720
No, seriously.

599
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,960
It would have to be published
after I died...

600
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,920
...when I wouldn't care what
anybody thought about me.

601
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:24,600
So, what would you write about,
if you were going to tell the truth?

602
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,440
In my book?

603
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,080
Well, the truth is,
I've met four presidents.

604
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,000
They all seemed like
they were out of it.

605
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,040
Like they had no idea
what was going on.

606
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,400
Even J.F.K. left me unimpressed.
I felt like I was with the boss' son.

607
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,080
You don't think you could say that?

608
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,240
Not if I was planning
on living in this country. No, no.

609
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:45,240
I don't think that Judy Garland
was such a great singer...

610
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,760
...after she turned 16.

611
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:50,200
That quiver, you know,
it was like she had no control over it.

612
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,280
I would get killed for saying that.

613
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,600
Or that Marilyn Monroe
was no better an actress...

614
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:59,160
...after she studied with
Lee Strasberg than before.

615
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:04,080
I'm saying what really happened.

616
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,800
Having to be a nice guy...

617
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,200
...is the toughest job in the world
when you're not.

618
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,120
This is a lamb in tea sauce.

619
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:24,000
This is twice-cooked pork
with shredded, pickled cabbage.

620
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,760
Kung Pao chicken.

621
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,400
And this is Kung Ping Loh Haa...

622
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:34,000
...lobster in tangerine peel
for you and your lovely lady friend.

623
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,280
You shouldn't have
done that, Stanley.

624
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,240
I don't eat lobster. I'm Jewish.

625
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,640
But you eat pork.

626
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,360
-Do you have a problem with that?
-No, I just thought-

627
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:47,240
No shrimp, no lobster.
They're disgusting. Take it away.

628
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,040
I will pay for the dish,
but take it away, please.

629
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,040
I'll change it.

630
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,400
I'm sorry, I...

631
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,800
I should have asked.
Maybe you love lobster.

632
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,680
I'm fine.

633
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,920
Have you ever had
Szechwan cuisine before?

634
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,560
It's from the northern part of China.

635
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,040
It must be strange for you.

636
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:13,560
If you complain to a waiter,
you're not just some jerk at table five...

637
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,920
...you're Lanny Morris.

638
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:18,400
I know that everyone
dreams about being famous...

639
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,320
...but it would be interesting
to know...

640
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,400
...what it's like
to relinquish all anonymity.

641
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,400
-Gets me a date.
-Does that bother you?

642
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,320
That people only wanna be with you
because of who you are?

643
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,480
-As opposed to?
-Well...

644
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,440
...the real you.

645
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,440
The real me.

646
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:48,360
The real me was brought up
as a nice middle-class kid...

647
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,120
...which is not the easiest thing...

648
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,640
...when you are extremely poor
and living in a slum.

649
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:58,840
The real me spent most of his time
getting the shit kicked out of him...

650
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,440
...and dreaming about
something better.

651
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,880
Like being here
with someone like you.

652
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:10,960
<i>Fifteen years ago, he had,
for one brief moment...</i>

653
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,920
<i>...made me feel like
the most special person in the world.</i>

654
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:18,320
"The miracle in my life
is not that I survived polio...

655
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,360
...and am standing here today.

656
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:24,400
No. The reason I consider myself
to be a miracle girl...

657
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,200
...is because I had
the good fortune...

658
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,440
...to meet Lanny and Vince
when I was sick. "

659
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:32,520
<i>It was a moment
seen by millions of people...</i>

660
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:36,240
<i>...but felt only by me.</i>

661
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:43,880
<i>That moment had changed my life.</i>

662
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,720
<i>I was about to find my own way
into Lanny's book...</i>

663
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:55,400
<i>...after he had found
such a powerful way into mine.</i>

664
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,160
Checking out today?

665
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,440
Is there a message
for Bonnie Trout?

666
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,920
-From one of our guests?
-Yes, Lanny Morris.

667
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,240
I'm afraid not.

668
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:37,440
-Are you sure?
-Oh, yes, I'm sure.

669
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,560
Do you need a cab?

670
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:51,280
I still don't understand
why Vince Collins is willing...

671
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:54,800
...to be involved in such
an exposé of himself.

672
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,720
Vince is a realist.

673
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:59,520
The days of his box-office
power are drawing to a close.

674
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,640
Given the amount of money
we're offering-

675
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:05,320
And it's because the investment
in Mr. Collins is so large...

676
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:11,200
...I've compiled a list of questions
we'd like the miracle girl to ask.

677
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,320
I don't wanna look at your questions.
I have my own approach.

678
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:24,480
Ms. O'Connor, we're not paying
a million dollars for your approach...

679
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,760
...we're paying for what
Vince Collins has to say.

680
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,960
To me. What he has to say to me.

681
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,440
Greg, this is not as easy as it looks.

682
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,640
If you go to Vince Collins
and ask him a series of questions...

683
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:39,000
...you'll come back here
with a 300-page press book.

684
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:42,160
Well, as I've always understood
this company's policy...

685
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,320
...while the book is being written...

686
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:48,760
...the relationship between the author
and editor is sacrosanct.

687
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,800
This isn't your typical book deal.

688
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:56,000
We've really just leased
an oil well called Vince Collins...

689
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:59,400
...and granted Ms. O'Connor
the right to tap.

690
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:02,920
I think we have a responsibility to...

691
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,600
...monitor the drilling.

692
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:30,240
-Hello.
-Mrs. O'Flaherty?

693
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:32,280
Yes.

694
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:36,000
My name's O'Connor.
I'm the one writing the book.

695
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:51,640
The book will be
centered around Vince Collins.

696
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:54,560
I'll be asking him a lot of questions.

697
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:59,560
I wanted to know if there were any
you'd like to have answered yourself.

698
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:07,680
Maureen and I planted this tree
on her fifth birthday.

699
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:12,360
Father did most of the digging,
of course.

700
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,480
She'd be 38.

701
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:19,200
I'm 59 myself.

702
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,880
If she were alive now...

703
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:28,640
...we'd be talking about things,
back and forth...

704
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,600
...like two women.

705
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:33,480
Like you and I are doing.

706
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,000
And Maureen's father?

707
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:44,360
Frank died six years ago.

708
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,040
He took his own life.

709
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:50,560
One night, just before he died...

710
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:53,760
...he dug up the earth
around this tree...

711
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,920
...he took the urn
with Maureen's ashes in it...

712
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:59,720
...and spread them around its roots.

713
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:05,160
So this is my daughter.

714
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:09,240
This is what I have of her.

715
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,560
<i>-Are you Catholic?
-My- My mother was.</i>

716
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,720
<i>Then you will understand
my dilemma.</i>

717
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:25,480
<i>Our faith offers an afterlife.</i>

718
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,840
A daughter needs her mother.

719
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:35,680
So I have to live out this life
as far from sin as I can manage.

720
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:41,000
<i>I'll never see my husband again.</i>

721
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,840
<i>He's consigned himself to hell.</i>

722
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,480
<i>But what if Maureen
killed herself too?</i>

723
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,560
She's in hell, with my husband.

724
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:59,720
The life I'm trying to lead
will bring me to heaven's grace...

725
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:04,000
...only to hear
their screams of torment.

726
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:07,600
<i>Chief Scaglia,
you were in the hotel room...</i>

727
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:10,840
<i>...when they found
Maureen's body in the tub.</i>

728
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:15,000
So was Sally, so was Lanny,
so was Vince.

729
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:20,400
And there was also
a PR lady there from the hotel.

730
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,280
How do you think she died?

731
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:25,880
She died in an auto accident
two weeks later. It was terrible.

732
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,360
No, Maureen.

733
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:33,120
-How did Maureen die?
-She drowned.

734
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:35,040
-Why?
-What do you mean, why?

735
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:37,640
You and I take baths all the time.
We don't drown in them.

736
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:40,760
You and I do not mix
sleeping pills with booze.

737
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:43,760
-She committed suicide?
-Overdose is the official story.

738
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:47,640
What's the official story on the fact
that the staff of the hotel in Miami...

739
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:50,760
<i>...all seemed to know she delivered
room service to the boys' suite...</i>

740
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,680
...three days before
and was never seen alive again?

741
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:55,160
What happened to her?

742
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:57,720
How did she end up
in a hotel room in New Jersey?

743
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:01,640
Sally never had any problem
moving girls around. Okay?

744
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:02,960
He had two hotels.

745
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:05,080
-So Sally arranged it?
-No, I don't think so.

746
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,040
You see, she was brought up there
as a reward for the boys...

747
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:10,760
...and I think she started
to party just a little too early.

748
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:13,360
She was a student.
This was a summer job.

749
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:14,760
Listen to me...

750
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:20,880
...the Palace Del Sol was very
important to Sally, okay?

751
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:24,120
He launched his new wing...

752
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:27,480
...with a push
from Lanny and Vince...

753
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:33,080
...and this stupid girl
shows up dead.

754
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:37,720
She's not gonna come back.
We do the best thing for all of us.

755
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:42,200
We speed up the investigation
and we cremate her. Okay?

756
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,520
End of story.

757
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:50,640
-Here you are.
-Here's your lobster.

758
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:53,640
-Enjoy.
-Looks great.

759
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:58,640
"Sally said, 'I'll have them send you
up your own shipment of lobsters.

760
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:00,800
<i>You like lobster?"'</i>

761
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:04,520
<i>We said we did
because we really did.</i>

762
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:08,040
<i>You shouldn't have done that,
Stanley. I don't eat lobster.</i>

763
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:13,160
<i>Were there any signs of violence
on her body?</i>

764
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:17,480
No, no. There were some
small scratches on the torso.

765
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:24,440
<i>Why did my daughter die?
Did she kill herself?</i>

766
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:28,720
<i>What had they done to her
that would make her do that?</i>

767
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:33,360
<i>What had they done?</i>

768
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:40,280
<i>Once upon a time...</i>

769
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:44,000
<i>...when terrible things
happened to people...</i>

770
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:46,640
<i>...they were left as a mystery.</i>

771
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:51,840
<i>Even the tabloids kept a distance.</i>

772
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:02,560
<i>Some things were allowed
to be left just the way they were.</i>

773
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,760
Any trouble with the directions
I gave you?

774
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:16,240
-Only the parts where I had to turn.
-Sorry.

775
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:19,400
It's the price of seclusion.

776
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:26,200
You haven't switched over
to cassette?

777
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:30,120
-Actually, it's my dad's.
-And what does he do?

778
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,480
He was a journalist too.

779
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:36,720
He did a big story on you once.

780
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:39,480
Followed a little girl who had polio.

781
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,960
You took her under your wing...

782
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:45,320
...and now she's interviewing you.

783
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,840
He must be proud that his daughter's
making such a name for herself.

784
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:54,360
I'd like to think so.

785
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:58,960
-He died last year.
-Sorry to hear that.

786
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:04,040
-Would you like some coffee?
-Sure.

787
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,600
Are you alone here?

788
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:16,640
Yes. The thought of having live-in help
is a little poisonous to me.

789
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,200
Why's that?

790
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,200
Well, I'd have to talk to them...

791
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,760
...ask them how
their family was doing...

792
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:25,480
...hear about this and that,
introduce them to the guests...

793
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:28,200
...and tell them
how their family was doing.

794
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:31,960
All so that I would
seem to be a nice guy...

795
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:33,680
...which is an awful lot of work...

796
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:36,200
...considering what I cherish
most in life these days...

797
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,400
...is not to have to be Vince Collins.

798
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:39,960
No Reuben in your life?

799
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,120
How do you know about Reuben?

800
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:46,880
He was in a lot of the material
I've been looking at.

801
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:48,480
No, I never had a Reuben.

802
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:50,920
Lanny always paid him directly.
He was Lanny's man.

803
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:52,520
Right.

804
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:56,800
You know, what I like is to...

805
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,560
...read...

806
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:00,960
...think.

807
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:03,240
It's to have the freedom...

808
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:05,840
...to get up and leave
without telling anyone about it...

809
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:07,880
...any time of day.

810
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:12,040
Or even having to say goodbye.

811
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:17,920
To be backstage, surrounded
by acrobats, actors, magicians...

812
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:19,920
...it was intoxicating.

813
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:21,880
You know, I was only 12 years old.

814
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:23,640
That's a...

815
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:25,280
That's a pretty impressionable age.

816
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:28,440
<i>-To hear all these stories of touring...
-My father always told me...</i>

817
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:32,000
<i>...that nothing had meaning
unless it could be put on the record.</i>

818
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:35,360
<i>Yet things had changed.</i>

819
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:38,440
<i>As Vince had pointed out
at our first meeting...</i>

820
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:42,760
<i>...it had become fashionable
to put yourself into the story.</i>

821
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:46,600
<i>The question became
how far you were prepared to go.</i>

822
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:13,120
-Excuse me. That's not mine.
-Oh, I'm sorry.

823
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:18,040
Aren't you Miss Trout?

824
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:20,760
We've met,
on the plane to New York.

825
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,120
-Reuben.
-Excuse me, sir.

826
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:24,960
Can I leave you
for just a second, please?

827
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:31,200
I'm so deeply sorry, Miss Trout,
the way you were treated.

828
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:35,240
-He could have left a note.
-Of course.

829
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:39,880
Miss Trout, I would like you
to understand something.

830
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:45,240
I have a great loyalty to Mr. Morris.
He's treated me very well.

831
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,080
I'm very grateful.

832
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:51,320
He has done wonderful things
for many people...

833
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:56,280
...and I have been privileged
to work for him.

834
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:00,000
But I do have certain principles...

835
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:04,240
...especially about how women
are to be treated and respected.

836
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:09,800
Mr. Morris can be very attentive,
but once he has a woman...

837
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:13,640
Oh, God, I think
it's almost a sickness.

838
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:17,320
When he left you that morning...

839
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:20,040
...you may have felt bad,
but believe me, Miss Trout...

840
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:21,960
...to have him out of your life...

841
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:24,760
...is the best thing that
could have happened to you.

842
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:29,320
At that point, you may have felt
your life was wounded.

843
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:32,520
It wasn't.

844
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:34,600
It was saved.

845
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:45,600
<i>Vince, I was very clear about this
from the beginning.</i>

846
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:47,320
<i>I'm not out to play games with you.</i>

847
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,800
<i>This is why you're being paid
a huge amount of money.</i>

848
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:52,520
<i>This isn't entirely about money,
you know.</i>

849
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:55,160
A million dollars is more than
the gross of your last film.

850
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,600
I was somehow
under the impression that my life...

851
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:01,640
...might have been of more than
passing interest.

852
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:04,680
But if my fleeting encounter with
a girl named Maureen O'Flaherty...

853
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:07,720
...is all you really want to talk about,
then that's what we'll do.

854
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:11,360
I have to make an appearance
at the clinic tomorrow.

855
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:13,600
We can come back
and talk after that.

856
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:16,240
It's Wonderland.

857
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:17,960
I imagine you might remember that.

858
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:35,560
<i>He was right.
I did remember Wonderland.</i>

859
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:38,040
-You ready?
-Ready.

860
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:43,280
<i>When I was a girl, the entire hospital
was devoted to children with polio.</i>

861
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:47,960
<i>Since that time,
it had become a clinic for kids...</i>

862
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:51,240
<i>...with a variety of different
physical handicaps.</i>

863
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:57,960
<i>Once a year, the children
would put on a pageant...</i>

864
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:01,320
<i>...playing different characters
from Alice in Wonderland.</i>

865
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:04,640
<i>Vince, in his continuing support
of the hospital...</i>

866
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:07,200
<i>...had hired a band and a singer.</i>

867
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,040
Who is that?

868
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:19,880
I don't know.
She's good, whoever she is.

869
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:33,960
Karen, do you mind if we start
this conversation tomorrow?

870
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:37,640
I'm just...
I'm not feeling all that well.

871
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:39,720
-Vince-
-In fact, it won't make...

872
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,120
...any difference over there.
The office is closed.

873
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:43,440
They've been working late.

874
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:45,560
Then they've been working
much too hard.

875
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:49,360
First thing tomorrow. First thing.

876
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:58,360
I hope your editors were reasonable.

877
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:01,400
Reasonable? No, they weren't.

878
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:03,560
We can go as late as you like.

879
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,000
That's good.

880
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:06,560
It might take us
into the evening.

881
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:08,640
I had a feeling
that might be the case.

882
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:11,680
So I've ordered a hot and cold
smorgasbord to be brought in.

883
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:13,280
We can work through dinner.

884
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:15,560
-We'll be having company?
-Yes.

885
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,440
I have...

886
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:20,280
...a surprise for you.

887
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,840
Actually, this is a fairly big deal
for me as well.

888
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,280
I've asked Lanny to join us today.

889
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:29,520
Lanny?

890
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:32,880
Well, this is something.

891
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:36,640
Neuman and Newberry will certainly
be getting their money's worth.

892
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:39,400
I thought that if I was
going to discuss something...

893
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:41,320
...that had such an impact
on our lives...

894
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:44,000
...it would be fair for Lanny
to hear what I had to say.

895
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:46,280
Given that we've
never talked about it.

896
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:49,040
I'm sure I'll have lots to ask him.
When is he coming?

897
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:51,080
He should be here any minute now.

898
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:53,400
This is very exciting.

899
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:55,680
Shit.

900
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:11,880
<i>-Yes?
-Bonnie, I have to talk fast.</i>

901
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:15,000
I need you to do exactly as I tell you
and I can't tell you why, okay?

902
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:16,360
<i>Sure.</i>

903
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:19,360
Excuse me, that might actually
be him now.

904
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:21,960
Yes, hello?

905
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:35,360
Yes, thank you.

906
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:38,280
That was my office.

907
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:40,840
There's a woman-
A friend, a relative of yours?

908
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:43,360
She said she called
on a number you gave her.

909
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,800
She's gonna call back.

910
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:54,080
<i>-Yes?
-Hi, kiddo.</i>

911
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:57,280
<i>Listen, your brother Clifford
has just been rushed to the hospital.</i>

912
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:59,160
<i>He was doing construction
when a thing-</i>

913
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:01,080
<i>-A steel girder?
-That's it.</i>

914
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:03,680
<i>You better come to the city
and make your peace with him.</i>

915
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:05,960
<i>You're booked on the next
flight to San Francisco.</i>

916
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:08,200
<i>I'm waiting here for you
in front of the terminal.</i>

917
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:11,000
They reserved me a seat
on the next flight to San Francisco.

918
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:12,440
-I'll drive you there.
-No, no.

919
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:15,560
Sharon is waiting at the airport for me.
You can't stand Lanny up.

920
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:18,120
Please give him
my deepest apologies.

921
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:29,840
-Hey.
-Please, I can explain.

922
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:32,840
You've broken the law,
Bonnie-fucking-Trout.

923
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:34,760
You've assumed
another person's identity...

924
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:37,240
...to get information
from a business competitor.

925
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:40,000
Obviously I lied about who I was.
I'm sorry.

926
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:42,280
It was a huge untruth.
It wasn't planned.

927
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:46,840
I was just freaked out about
suddenly being on the plane with-

928
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:49,160
With you...

929
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:51,560
How did you get the seat
behind me on the plane?

930
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:53,320
-It was pure coincidence.
-Bullshit!

931
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:54,880
It's true.

932
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:02,320
How could you-? How could you have
just left me at the hotel like that?

933
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:03,880
You were asleep.

934
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:07,120
Reuben woke me to say
I had to be a substitute performer...

935
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:11,400
...at a charity concert at the Hollywood
Bowl. I had to get the first flight out.

936
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:13,080
You could have left a note
or called.

937
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:15,240
-I did leave you a note.
-Where?

938
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:20,480
I don't know why we're even talking
about this. I don't like you.

939
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:23,480
All right? I wish we had never met.

940
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:30,280
Hello, Vince.

941
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,640
What the fuck's going on?

942
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:37,040
Vince, a few days after we first met...

943
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,960
...I found myself next to Lanny
on a flight to New York.

944
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,720
It was a complete coincidence.

945
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:43,520
-He asked my name-
-And she lied.

946
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:46,840
I had just finished reading the first
chapter of Lanny's own biography.

947
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:50,280
His lawyers had let me see it in the
hope of discouraging our own project.

948
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:52,920
As a reflex, since I knew he
would view me as the enemy...

949
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:54,680
...I gave him the name of a friend...

950
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:56,880
...whose apartment I was
staying at in Manhattan.

951
00:59:57,080 --> 01:00:00,240
I thought I just had to get through
the awkwardness of the flight itself...

952
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:02,360
-... but the trouble is-
-You slept with him.

953
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:07,400
-Vince-
-You slept with my ex-partner.

954
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:09,960
Technically.

955
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:14,400
Doesn't sound like things were
particularly technical.

956
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:37,240
Now, you listen to me, sweetheart.

957
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,760
Vince doesn't always do
what's best for Vince.

958
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:44,440
That's why he needed me
here today.

959
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:48,920
The story of this girl is the
most painful thing in his life.

960
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:51,200
What happened to her, Lanny?

961
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:54,120
Well, you're not gonna find out.

962
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:56,520
Not now.

963
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:59,320
Not after what you've done to him.

964
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:09,880
Vince.

965
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:11,320
Oh, shit.

966
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:15,160
Vince...

967
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:17,240
...I made a terrible mistake
in New York.

968
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:20,680
I apologize to you
more than I know how to say.

969
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:23,000
I'm so sorry.

970
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:35,560
Vince, the realization
of your life story...

971
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:38,280
...shouldn't be threatened
because of my failings.

972
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:43,040
Please let me continue
to work with you again.

973
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,440
I'll help you tell your story right.

974
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:50,760
Come back tonight.

975
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:54,360
Let me think about it.

976
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:10,200
-How do you like the wine?
-It's magnificent. What is it?

977
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:12,800
1961 Haut-Brion.

978
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,640
People make a big deal of 1959...

979
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:18,040
...but I don't think there'll be
a year as special as 1961.

980
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:21,320
It was a great year for French wines.

981
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:26,360
Will you join me?

982
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:28,680
What are they?

983
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:33,200
They're like very mild-mannered
Quaaludes.

984
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:35,440
Must've done a few of those
in your time, right?

985
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:38,520
Are you sure they're okay
with alcohol?

986
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:42,080
Oh, they're even better with alcohol.
Believe me, I'd know.

987
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:50,080
Come on in, honey. The water's fine.

988
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:55,720
<i>All my life, I've had this idea
that I could always be in control.</i>

989
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:58,160
<i>Ever since I was sick,
I had this sense...</i>

990
01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:01,400
<i>...that I could make my body
do anything I wanted.</i>

991
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:03,200
<i>If I could will my polio away...</i>

992
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:06,720
<i>...I'd certainly be able to will away
the effect of any drug.</i>

993
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:23,400
Do you mind if I close the drapes?
The sun's in my eyes.

994
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:26,920
It's moonlight.

995
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:29,760
Go ahead.

996
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:31,120
I remember you.

997
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:33,360
You're Alice.

998
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,040
In Wonderland.

999
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:38,840
Oh, I don't know.

1000
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:41,320
I'm really stoned
out of my head already.

1001
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:44,080
Is it good?

1002
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:53,320
Jesus, Vince. It's like monster grass.

1003
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:55,720
Do you get this stuff all the time?

1004
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:57,800
All the time.

1005
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:09,120
You're Alice.

1006
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:13,440
You're so beautiful.

1007
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:43,080
She's ours.

1008
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:45,680
Isn't that so, Alice?

1009
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:48,920
I'm yours.

1010
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:22,600
I like you.

1011
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:37,880
<i>I had always been fascinated by how
some women could cross the line...</i>

1012
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:42,520
<i>...between who they were and who
they would let themselves become.</i>

1013
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:44,840
<i>Maureen...</i>

1014
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:47,280
<i>...Alice...</i>

1015
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:49,440
<i>...and now...</i>

1016
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:51,120
<i>...me.</i>

1017
01:06:57,360 --> 01:06:58,640
Morning.

1018
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:02,000
That was not a Quaalude you
gave me. I've had Quaaludes.

1019
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:04,520
I said it was like a Quaalude.

1020
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:07,000
And you didn't take one yourself.
You palmed the pill.

1021
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:09,120
Somebody had to drive.

1022
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:11,760
Don't worry, you won't get pregnant.

1023
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:13,720
Not from Alice,
and certainly not from me.

1024
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:16,360
I never took off my pants,
as you may or may not remember.

1025
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:18,160
There are laws against
drugging people.

1026
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:22,200
Oh, please. You took it voluntarily.
Nobody slipped it into your drink.

1027
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:26,960
And you chased it with one of the most
expensive wines in the world.

1028
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:30,440
You're just in a dither because you've
discovered you can swing both ways.

1029
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:34,400
You see...

1030
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:37,200
...I needed to get something on you.

1031
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:40,520
Of course, your behavior with Lanny
might have been even better than this.

1032
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:42,440
But I'd already set the wheels
in motion.

1033
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:46,440
And as I was dying to see
you and Alice get it on...

1034
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:48,960
Well, these are just a sample.

1035
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:58,960
Why would she agree to do this?
Doesn't she want a career?

1036
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:01,320
Well, it's your career
I'm worried about.

1037
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:04,120
You're a journalist
playing loose with the rules.

1038
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:06,920
She's just a vulnerable young singer
you seduced.

1039
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:10,040
A promising- Oh, good heavens.

1040
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:13,000
Promising artist
that I happen to manage.

1041
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:14,920
You met her through me...

1042
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:16,960
...and had your way with her.

1043
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:23,040
What do you want from me?

1044
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:28,120
You're going to continue
writing the book.

1045
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:32,040
I'm going to continue telling you
juicy stories, funny stories...

1046
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:34,240
...heart-tugging stories.

1047
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:36,640
And you're not going to ask me
a single question...

1048
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:38,960
...about what happened
to the girl in New Jersey.

1049
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:42,920
You're going to go to your publisher,
say you tried every angle...

1050
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:45,960
...but you could find nothing odd
or suspicious in what I told you.

1051
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:55,240
I'll even try to spice it up a little,
talk about how...

1052
01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:58,280
...the night before the telethon,
I wanted to sleep like a babe...

1053
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:00,680
...so to cover my bets,
I kept a few babes on hand.

1054
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:03,080
Well, not exactly on my hand...

1055
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:06,520
...and that's not my preference,
as you might have gathered by now.

1056
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:19,440
So you get your bestseller,
I get my million.

1057
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:20,840
Everyone goes home happy.

1058
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:24,160
You've dreaded talking about
Maureen O'Flaherty since we met.

1059
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:26,440
If it's something you're so
desperate to avoid...

1060
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:28,520
...why would you ever agree
to do this book?

1061
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:30,800
I need the money.

1062
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,280
Vince, anything you say
in my presence is mine to use.

1063
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:38,000
Everything you said last night
and everything you've just told me.

1064
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:40,840
And since I'm also allowed to include
contextual background...

1065
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,960
...I can write about
how you set me up...

1066
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:46,400
...how you tried to blackmail me.
I'll even include those Polaroids.

1067
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:49,800
It's your word against mine. We have
a contract. Everything's in my words.

1068
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:53,160
We've agreed to your answers,
but there's nothing to stop me...

1069
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:57,840
...from putting any information I want
into a question I ask.

1070
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:01,720
Information that I'd like to be
public knowledge...

1071
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:05,000
...or that the police
might wanna look into.

1072
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:13,600
Would you like me to fire one of my
loaded questions, on the record?

1073
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:16,120
Sure.

1074
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:24,800
Vince...

1075
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:28,600
...in your suite
at the Versailles Hotel in Miami...

1076
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:31,520
...was it your or Lanny's idea...

1077
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:34,920
...to put Maureen's body into the case
containing shellfish and ice...

1078
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:36,680
...and have it shipped
to New Jersey?

1079
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:44,120
No answer, Mr. Collins?
So noted.

1080
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:47,480
Oh, and incidentally,
by not answering...

1081
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:50,160
...you're in violation of your contract.

1082
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:53,800
What a shame.
I understood you needed that money.

1083
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:10,000
Oh, no. Oh, God.

1084
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:13,760
Oh, God.
Oh, God. Oh, God!

1085
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:23,880
Was that how
you murdered Maureen?

1086
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:38,520
Ask Lanny.

1087
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:43,120
He's the one who knows.

1088
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:04,400
<i>It wasn't that hard for him
to get the suite he wanted.</i>

1089
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:08,440
<i>The Versailles was still one of the
fanciest of the hotels along the beach.</i>

1090
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:11,200
<i>But by then, its era had passed.</i>

1091
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:14,080
Thank you, sir.

1092
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:25,360
<i>All the furniture was new.</i>

1093
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:27,840
<i>It had been 15 years...</i>

1094
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:30,400
<i>...but the floor plan...</i>

1095
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:32,680
<i>...was still the same.</i>

1096
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:35,600
<i>In that spot...</i>

1097
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:38,720
<i>...that was where the truth
had come out.</i>

1098
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:42,400
<i>That was why she had to die.</i>

1099
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:55,240
Are you Japanese or Chinese?

1100
01:12:56,440 --> 01:12:58,080
Vietnamese.

1101
01:12:58,520 --> 01:13:01,640
The kitchen tell me
you famous person.

1102
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:03,720
Why you famous?

1103
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:06,080
They didn't tell you my name?

1104
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:07,440
No.

1105
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:09,280
What is it?

1106
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:13,240
Lanny Morris.

1107
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:15,560
It's a Jewish name...

1108
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:17,160
...but I'm a nebbish.

1109
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:20,680
You ordered three bottle
of champagne.

1110
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:22,120
You want me to open one now?

1111
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:24,720
Or wait until friend come?

1112
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:27,240
Open all three.

1113
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:31,040
Are you really famous, Mr. Morris?

1114
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:33,760
In my day.

1115
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:36,160
Before your time, I suppose.

1116
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:39,600
I come from the north of Vietnam.

1117
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:42,040
In my town, there is no television.

1118
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:46,360
<i>She explained that American movies
had been banned where she grew up.</i>

1119
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:53,960
<i>She got better tips pretending
she was Madame Butterfly...</i>

1120
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:57,080
<i>...than by telling people
where she was really from.</i>

1121
01:13:58,160 --> 01:14:00,160
What did you do, Mr. Morris?

1122
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:03,640
I made Vince Collins' life...

1123
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:06,080
...very difficult.

1124
01:14:06,280 --> 01:14:09,320
<i>She didn't understand, but her policy
was not to linger in the rooms...</i>

1125
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:11,400
<i>...of solitary gentlemen.</i>

1126
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:16,840
<i>He signed the room-service check
under Lanny's name.</i>

1127
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,480
Thank you.

1128
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:44,760
<i>There was no ice or water
left in the buckets...</i>

1129
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:47,640
<i>...when his body was discovered
the next morning.</i>

1130
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:52,440
<i>He had dumped the ice into
the bathtub and died in it.</i>

1131
01:14:53,640 --> 01:14:56,600
<i>He must have felt
there was some poetry in it.</i>

1132
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:02,120
<i>His plan was to drink
enough champagne...</i>

1133
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:03,680
<i>...with enough sleeping pills...</i>

1134
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:07,600
<i>...so that ending things would
become an acceptable idea.</i>

1135
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:10,120
<i>He could manage that.</i>

1136
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:14,120
<i>He knew for certain
he couldn't manage anything else.</i>

1137
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:19,040
Hi.

1138
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:23,800
I thought you were
gonna be out all afternoon.

1139
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:30,040
I'm sorry.

1140
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:32,240
It's okay.

1141
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:35,120
This was under the door.

1142
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:43,600
What is it?

1143
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:47,200
Chapter three.

1144
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:53,040
<i>John, as my lawyer, I want you
to know that this next chapter...</i>

1145
01:15:53,240 --> 01:15:56,080
<i>...is to be read
after Vince and my death...</i>

1146
01:15:56,280 --> 01:16:00,760
<i>...and is only to be used under
the most extreme of circumstances.</i>

1147
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:04,400
<i>We knew we wanted to make
an early night of it...</i>

1148
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:07,880
<i>...with the telethon starting the next
day, so Vince suggested we dine in...</i>

1149
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:10,960
<i>...so Maureen could do
the interview for her campus paper.</i>

1150
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:15,960
This is a gift for us
from the audience...

1151
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:20,360
...from the people,
the people that are out there.

1152
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:25,240
Sooner or later you gotta say,
"We wanna give something back. "

1153
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:27,040
I think that's really important.

1154
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:31,360
Not many people would take
the time out to do that. Thank you.

1155
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:34,160
<i>She actually hid her tape recorder
in the room-service cart...</i>

1156
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:37,000
<i>...because she didn't want
the hotel to find out.</i>

1157
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:47,600
<i>We finished the interview
and then asked her to stay.</i>

1158
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:54,440
<i>To help us get into the mood,
I did a Tuinal...</i>

1159
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:56,200
<i>...then she did one...</i>

1160
01:16:56,400 --> 01:17:00,360
<i>...and Vince, he did two,
because he was always doing two.</i>

1161
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:05,000
<i>We got into the second of the
three bottles of Moët we'd ordered.</i>

1162
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:10,160
<i>We thought it would be better to keep
the action to neutral territory.</i>

1163
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:14,840
<i>God...</i>

1164
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:16,760
<i>...she was beautiful.</i>

1165
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:21,480
<i>I chain-locked the front door
to the living room...</i>

1166
01:17:21,640 --> 01:17:25,040
<i>...to make sure that housekeeping,
eager to turn down our beds...</i>

1167
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:27,680
<i>...didn't walk in on an employee
having a ménage à trois...</i>

1168
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:29,920
<i>...with the hotel's headliners.</i>

1169
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:32,840
<i>Then I went to chain-lock
the door to Vince's room.</i>

1170
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:36,200
<i>I took a quick shower,
I put on my robe...</i>

1171
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:40,480
<i>...and brought a robe for Maureen,
in case she felt a little bashful.</i>

1172
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:46,120
<i>So much for bashful.</i>

1173
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:49,800
<i>I threw the robe on the bed
and moved into the room...</i>

1174
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,880
<i>...half-worried that they would
finish without me.</i>

1175
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:02,400
<i>I've always preferred
the missionary position.</i>

1176
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:06,080
<i>I have to see their faces,
look into their eyes.</i>

1177
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:10,320
<i>Unless they're acting, and I'd like
to think I can tell the difference...</i>

1178
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:12,480
<i>...there comes that moment...</i>

1179
01:18:12,680 --> 01:18:14,640
<i>...when, if you're looking...</i>

1180
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:17,200
<i>...if you're really looking...</i>

1181
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:20,600
<i>...you'll see exactly who she is.</i>

1182
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:23,560
<i>This was different.</i>

1183
01:18:23,720 --> 01:18:27,360
<i>It was like
she saw exactly who I was.</i>

1184
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,280
<i>Watch it there, compadre.</i>

1185
01:18:48,040 --> 01:18:50,720
It's a little hard to tell who's who,
under the circumstances.

1186
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:54,160
I'm the one that's more than
a little hard, you dumb fucking limey.

1187
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:58,240
Well, I'm- I'm the one with a foreskin.
Don't you forget that.

1188
01:19:01,640 --> 01:19:03,480
Watch it. You got the end zone
there, Vince.

1189
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:06,560
-Come on, come on. Fuck.
-You're gonna like it.

1190
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:08,760
It's like from another planet
when you come.

1191
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:10,680
-Get the fuck off me.
-I'd never hurt you.

1192
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:12,640
-I'd never hurt you.
-Get the fuck off me!

1193
01:19:12,840 --> 01:19:15,920
-No, trust me. It's like double the sex-
-Get the fuck off me!

1194
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:18,520
We don't fuck, Vince!

1195
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:22,080
We're buddies, we're pals,
we're partners, we're a duo.

1196
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:25,400
We love each other,
but we don't fuck!

1197
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:28,360
We're fucking stars!

1198
01:19:28,520 --> 01:19:29,880
-We can travel together.
-Okay.

1199
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:34,680
We can hang out together, we can live
together, but we can't be queers!

1200
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:37,760
It's not funny!

1201
01:19:59,680 --> 01:20:01,720
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1202
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:03,320
About?

1203
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:07,360
About your nose.

1204
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:11,560
It's not broken, is it?

1205
01:20:14,120 --> 01:20:15,520
It's how I am.

1206
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:19,320
Guess the question is,
who's gonna pay me?

1207
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:21,560
<i>This surprised me.</i>

1208
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:24,040
<i>The girl was not a hooker.</i>

1209
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:36,680
<i>My wallet was on top of my robe.</i>

1210
01:20:37,160 --> 01:20:39,040
<i>I took out some money.</i>

1211
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:41,520
<i>I don't remember how much.</i>

1212
01:20:57,480 --> 01:20:58,840
I don't think so.

1213
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:02,600
That's more than you would
make in a month of tips.

1214
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:05,000
I'm not looking for a tip.

1215
01:21:06,040 --> 01:21:07,600
What the hell are you saying?

1216
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:10,080
Honey, I'm in my last year
of college.

1217
01:21:10,280 --> 01:21:12,840
This is a summer job.

1218
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:17,760
I wanna write.

1219
01:21:17,960 --> 01:21:20,400
I wanna be a journalist.

1220
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:27,640
So I could either
use this information...

1221
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:30,240
...or I could use a lot of money.

1222
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:35,240
I promise you
this will only cost you once.

1223
01:21:38,280 --> 01:21:41,480
I'm so tired, I don't even think
I'm going home.

1224
01:21:42,440 --> 01:21:44,000
I think it's the Tuinals.

1225
01:21:46,280 --> 01:21:49,360
Hey, Lanny, don't take it personally.

1226
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:51,840
You were a great lover.

1227
01:21:52,040 --> 01:21:55,320
You have got the cutest little butt.

1228
01:21:59,720 --> 01:22:02,280
I guess Vince thinks so too.

1229
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:08,880
Night, Lanny.

1230
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:14,200
<i>I would never see her alive again.</i>

1231
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:18,800
<i>I put a "Do Not Disturb" sign
on my door...</i>

1232
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:22,080
<i>...fastened the chain lock,
in case the maid didn't read.</i>

1233
01:22:22,280 --> 01:22:24,120
<i>I left a wake-up call for 8...</i>

1234
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:26,640
<i>...and went to sleep
knowing that a telethon...</i>

1235
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:30,680
<i>...was the least of the ordeals I was
going to have to face in the morning.</i>

1236
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:37,240
<i>The Tuinals had really
conked me out...</i>

1237
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:40,440
<i>...and I slept through
my wake-up call that morning.</i>

1238
01:22:40,640 --> 01:22:42,680
<i>The operator had called Reuben
down the hall...</i>

1239
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:44,520
<i>...to see if he could wake me...</i>

1240
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:47,760
<i>...but he couldn't get in because
we had chain-locked all the doors.</i>

1241
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:50,560
Reuben!

1242
01:22:50,760 --> 01:22:53,480
<i>I yelled for Reuben to wake up Vince
while I worked on Maureen...</i>

1243
01:22:53,680 --> 01:22:57,320
<i>...trying to make myself believe
that she was still sleeping.</i>

1244
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:01,280
Fuck.

1245
01:23:01,680 --> 01:23:03,240
No, no. Fuck.

1246
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:06,800
<i>The autopsy revealed the drugs
and alcohol in her body...</i>

1247
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,600
<i>...but I knew
it wasn't enough to kill her.</i>

1248
01:23:13,640 --> 01:23:15,320
<i>All three doors to the suite...</i>

1249
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:18,920
<i>...were chain-locked from the inside
when I found her.</i>

1250
01:23:19,480 --> 01:23:20,720
<i>I hadn't touched her.</i>

1251
01:23:20,920 --> 01:23:26,760
<i>That's how I know that my former
partner and friend, Vince Collins...</i>

1252
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:30,080
<i>...murdered Maureen O'Flaherty.</i>

1253
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:37,000
<i>You must have guessed by now
that Vince and I had found a way...</i>

1254
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:40,040
<i>...to relocate Maureen's body
to New Jersey.</i>

1255
01:23:40,240 --> 01:23:43,640
<i>This is the one criminal act
the both of us committed...</i>

1256
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:48,200
<i>...but we were in a panic and
needed to create an ironclad alibi.</i>

1257
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:50,800
<i>The crates were delivered
to our room.</i>

1258
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,600
<i>The publicist had opened the crates
for a photo op.</i>

1259
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:55,240
<i>But the official story became...</i>

1260
01:23:55,440 --> 01:23:58,000
<i>...that she found Maureen's
overdosed body in the tub.</i>

1261
01:23:58,200 --> 01:24:02,040
<i>A police officer called Scaglia
was there to witness the whole thing.</i>

1262
01:24:02,240 --> 01:24:04,160
<i>Live, until they drop dead...</i>

1263
01:24:04,360 --> 01:24:05,680
<i>During the telethon...</i>

1264
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:09,760
<i>...I kept telling myself that I could
forgive Vince for two reasons.</i>

1265
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:12,720
<i>First of all, I don't think he could
have known what he was doing.</i>

1266
01:24:12,920 --> 01:24:16,120
<i>He was completely out of it,
even more than usual.</i>

1267
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:18,120
<i>The second is that he was terrified...</i>

1268
01:24:18,280 --> 01:24:21,280
<i>...that this incident would become
public knowledge.</i>

1269
01:24:21,480 --> 01:24:25,000
<i>In those days, the slightest hint
that he could swing both ways...</i>

1270
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:28,640
<i>...would destroy his
show-business career in an instant.</i>

1271
01:24:29,480 --> 01:24:32,240
<i>As it was, it was only to destroy us.</i>

1272
01:24:32,840 --> 01:24:34,800
<i>We completed the telethon...</i>

1273
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,480
<i>...but we both knew
we were finished.</i>

1274
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:39,600
<i>The marriage...</i>

1275
01:24:40,040 --> 01:24:41,720
<i>...was over.</i>

1276
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:45,760
<i>There was a moment
in the middle of the telethon...</i>

1277
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:48,440
<i>...where I actually broke down.</i>

1278
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:51,680
<i>I just couldn't control myself.</i>

1279
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:54,240
<i>I remember I mumbled something...</i>

1280
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:58,760
<i>...to a little girl who was recounting
her experiences with the disease.</i>

1281
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:01,680
<i>I don't remember what I said...</i>

1282
01:25:02,120 --> 01:25:04,840
<i>...but I do remember
feeling worthless.</i>

1283
01:25:06,440 --> 01:25:09,120
<i>Everyone thought that my tears
were for her.</i>

1284
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:12,680
<i>It made for a great picture
in the papers the next day.</i>

1285
01:25:14,920 --> 01:25:16,680
Mr. Morris will see you now.

1286
01:25:40,120 --> 01:25:43,160
I expected to see you
at Vince's funeral.

1287
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:48,600
Kind of heartless of you not to
show up, don't you think, Karen?

1288
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:52,000
Considering you're probably
the one that...

1289
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:55,320
...drove him to it.

1290
01:25:56,840 --> 01:25:58,360
I won't answer that.

1291
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:02,560
So don't.

1292
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:04,640
So get the fuck out of my office.

1293
01:26:05,320 --> 01:26:09,840
Lanny, I have interview material with
Vince up until the moment he met you.

1294
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:12,120
It would be great if this...

1295
01:26:12,440 --> 01:26:14,880
...warm, funny side of Vince
could reach the public.

1296
01:26:15,080 --> 01:26:18,520
And what the fuck do you know
about Vince's warm and funny side?

1297
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:23,200
What about the warm and funny fact
that he killed himself?

1298
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:26,760
-Why would he do that?
-I don't know.

1299
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:30,440
That's the answer I'm giving you...

1300
01:26:30,640 --> 01:26:32,640
...and anyone else that asks.

1301
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:35,800
-"I don't know. "
-But you do know, don't you, Lanny?

1302
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:37,960
Whatever I know, sweetheart...

1303
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:39,400
...I'm writing in my book.

1304
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:43,680
Except you're never
going to finish your book.

1305
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:45,600
You don't have to.

1306
01:26:46,640 --> 01:26:48,520
The person who needed
your book is dead.

1307
01:26:50,120 --> 01:26:52,040
You always wrote the material
for your shows.

1308
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:53,960
Every single word was rehearsed.

1309
01:26:54,160 --> 01:26:56,520
The book was a manual,
a set of notes...

1310
01:26:56,720 --> 01:26:59,440
...so Vince would get
every detail of the official story.

1311
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:03,080
"A couple of extra babes for him
to sleep with that night.

1312
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:05,160
A few of them on hand.

1313
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:08,040
Well, not exactly on his hand.
That wasn't his preference. "

1314
01:27:09,640 --> 01:27:12,560
-So, what's your point?
-He quoted that very line to me.

1315
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:16,800
Quoted it from your manuscript as if
he were saying it for the first time.

1316
01:27:18,920 --> 01:27:21,160
You wrote it because you loved him.

1317
01:27:24,920 --> 01:27:26,960
And feared for him.

1318
01:27:29,680 --> 01:27:31,200
And feared for yourself.

1319
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:37,800
And then you wrote this:

1320
01:27:43,120 --> 01:27:44,520
Where the fuck did you get that?

1321
01:27:44,720 --> 01:27:47,160
-Delivered to my room.
-Bullshit. You stole it.

1322
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:51,480
Maureen O'Flaherty was killed
in the Versailles Hotel, in your room...

1323
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:54,120
...the night before the telethon.

1324
01:27:56,440 --> 01:27:58,720
The night before we met.

1325
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:06,920
Get out of my office.

1326
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:55,160
Miss Trout?

1327
01:28:56,240 --> 01:28:59,200
<i>We walked through the deserted
backlot of the studio...</i>

1328
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:03,480
<i>...and I confessed
that I wasn't Bonnie Trout.</i>

1329
01:29:03,680 --> 01:29:05,680
<i>That I was writing a book
about Vince Collins.</i>

1330
01:29:05,880 --> 01:29:07,920
<i>And that I was trying
to uncover the secret...</i>

1331
01:29:08,120 --> 01:29:10,360
<i>...behind what happened
to Maureen O'Flaherty.</i>

1332
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:13,200
<i>I told him what I found out.</i>

1333
01:29:13,400 --> 01:29:14,960
<i>He prayed that he would
be forgiven...</i>

1334
01:29:15,160 --> 01:29:17,360
<i>...for having been there
as the murder was concealed.</i>

1335
01:29:17,560 --> 01:29:19,200
Miss O'Connor...

1336
01:29:19,480 --> 01:29:23,280
...I have a tape recording of
the night Miss O'Flaherty was killed.

1337
01:29:23,880 --> 01:29:26,920
She had brought a machine.

1338
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:30,880
-For the interview.
-Yes.

1339
01:29:31,080 --> 01:29:34,080
I found it as I was
getting rid of her things.

1340
01:29:35,720 --> 01:29:38,280
She kept it on?

1341
01:29:40,040 --> 01:29:42,880
Could you use this tape
for your book?

1342
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:48,480
Of course.

1343
01:29:49,080 --> 01:29:50,680
Miss O'Connor...

1344
01:29:51,560 --> 01:29:53,320
...is it something...?

1345
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:55,920
Oh, my.

1346
01:29:56,120 --> 01:29:58,080
Is it something I could sell?

1347
01:29:59,080 --> 01:30:02,040
Reuben, I can't speak
on behalf of my publishers...

1348
01:30:02,240 --> 01:30:04,680
...but I'm sure that we can
settle on a price.

1349
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:07,160
Oh, thank you, Miss O'Connor.

1350
01:30:10,760 --> 01:30:13,240
<i>I'll even spice it up a little,
talk about how...</i>

1351
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:16,320
<i>...the night before the telethon,
I wanted to sleep like a babe.</i>

1352
01:30:16,520 --> 01:30:19,160
So to cover my bets,
I kept a few babes on hand.

1353
01:30:19,720 --> 01:30:21,480
Well, not exactly on my hand.

1354
01:30:21,640 --> 01:30:24,840
That's not my preference,
as you may have gathered by now.

1355
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:28,520
I need the money.

1356
01:30:30,360 --> 01:30:32,960
Did you have a figure in mind?

1357
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:37,960
Would you think a million dollars
would be too much?

1358
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:42,600
Vince was being paid
a million dollars for his life.

1359
01:30:42,760 --> 01:30:44,040
This is one night.

1360
01:30:44,960 --> 01:30:46,880
The most important night.

1361
01:30:48,280 --> 01:30:50,200
<i>You could have left me a note
or called me.</i>

1362
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:52,960
<i>-I did leave you a note.
-Where?</i>

1363
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:04,520
Lanny left this for me
at my apartment.

1364
01:31:05,560 --> 01:31:08,120
It's his version
of what happened that night.

1365
01:31:09,400 --> 01:31:12,960
On its own,
it's absolutely useless to me.

1366
01:31:13,160 --> 01:31:15,440
I could have typed it myself.

1367
01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:23,040
But if it matched
what's recorded on your tape...

1368
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:27,400
...it would make it priceless.

1369
01:31:32,160 --> 01:31:33,960
Which is why you sent it to me.

1370
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:39,800
You just said
Mr. Morris left it at your apartment.

1371
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,320
He was surprised I had it.

1372
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:47,800
Like he was surprised I hadn't found
the note he left for me at the hotel.

1373
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,600
The note you must've disposed of
as you were tidying the room.

1374
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:52,840
I told you how he deals with women.
I was afraid.

1375
01:31:53,040 --> 01:31:54,760
<i>Really afraid of what
he might do to you.</i>

1376
01:31:54,920 --> 01:31:56,960
<i>Maybe you were afraid of what I'd-</i>

1377
01:31:57,160 --> 01:31:59,560
I'd do to him. And to you.

1378
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:03,520
Why would I be afraid of
a schoolteacher called Bonnie Trout?

1379
01:32:03,720 --> 01:32:06,160
Because you knew I was
Karen O'Connor.

1380
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:09,000
When I woke up,
you folded my clothes...

1381
01:32:09,160 --> 01:32:11,000
...and placed my pocketbook
on the bed.

1382
01:32:11,200 --> 01:32:15,040
The pocketbook that had my name
and the letter from my publisher.

1383
01:32:16,680 --> 01:32:19,840
I was writing about the one thing
you wanted to have total control over:

1384
01:32:20,040 --> 01:32:21,920
Collins and Morris.

1385
01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:27,320
You made me abandon any thought
of trying to contact Lanny.

1386
01:32:27,880 --> 01:32:30,200
You made me feel like I was
less than nothing to him...

1387
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:32,480
...because you were playing
your own complex game.

1388
01:32:32,680 --> 01:32:38,120
And what exactly was this complex
game I was playing, Miss O'Connor?

1389
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:57,600
You were in the room.

1390
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:00,520
That night.

1391
01:33:01,240 --> 01:33:03,840
Lanny had a robe.
He dropped it on the bed.

1392
01:33:04,040 --> 01:33:06,520
After Maureen asked for money...

1393
01:33:06,720 --> 01:33:08,600
...the wallet was on top.
It had been folded.

1394
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:12,160
Well, I always, always arranged
Mr. Morris' things.

1395
01:33:12,360 --> 01:33:15,480
After he went to bed.
You were there before.

1396
01:33:15,680 --> 01:33:18,720
How would I get out?
All three doors were chain-locked.

1397
01:33:36,320 --> 01:33:38,400
Through Vince's room.

1398
01:33:39,800 --> 01:33:41,280
Then, the next morning...

1399
01:33:41,480 --> 01:33:44,680
<i>...you must have chain-locked the
door before you went to wake him up.</i>

1400
01:33:48,600 --> 01:33:50,640
Fuck!

1401
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:55,880
Lanny let me read the first chapter.

1402
01:33:56,080 --> 01:33:58,320
Vince sent me the second.

1403
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:02,600
And you stole this.

1404
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:04,160
To whet my appetite.

1405
01:34:27,680 --> 01:34:29,320
<i>I wanna write.</i>

1406
01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:31,360
<i>I wanna be a journalist.</i>

1407
01:34:31,960 --> 01:34:34,880
<i>So I could either
use this information...</i>

1408
01:34:35,720 --> 01:34:37,600
<i>...or I could use a lot of money.</i>

1409
01:34:37,800 --> 01:34:40,080
Is that why you killed her?

1410
01:34:41,320 --> 01:34:42,520
To protect them?

1411
01:34:49,560 --> 01:34:53,280
<i>For 15 years...</i>

1412
01:34:53,480 --> 01:34:56,400
<i>...he tormented Vince and Lanny.</i>

1413
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:03,360
<i>He could never blackmail Vince
while Sally Sanmarco was alive...</i>

1414
01:35:04,240 --> 01:35:08,440
<i>...so he waited until Sally died
to activate his retirement plan:</i>

1415
01:35:10,920 --> 01:35:13,880
<i>A million dollars from Vince.</i>

1416
01:35:14,600 --> 01:35:18,760
<i>A million dollars for the same tape
he offered to me.</i>

1417
01:35:23,480 --> 01:35:27,200
<i>He would never get his money,
and I would never see him again.</i>

1418
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,520
<i>He had taken her life...</i>

1419
01:35:35,720 --> 01:35:38,360
<i>...and with it her mother's heart...</i>

1420
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,200
<i>...and her father's mind.</i>

1421
01:35:42,760 --> 01:35:44,200
<i>And now...</i>

1422
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:47,520
<i>...all that remained
of Maureen O'Flaherty...</i>

1423
01:35:47,720 --> 01:35:51,560
<i>...was a tree
in her mother's garden.</i>

1424
01:36:05,720 --> 01:36:08,840
Your daughter learned something
about Vince Collins...

1425
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,520
...that he didn't want anyone to know.

1426
01:36:11,800 --> 01:36:13,440
Because of that...

1427
01:36:13,640 --> 01:36:15,120
...she was killed.

1428
01:36:15,320 --> 01:36:18,360
If it's of any small comfort,
she probably didn't suffer.

1429
01:36:18,920 --> 01:36:22,400
I want people
to know about this man.

1430
01:36:22,960 --> 01:36:25,640
I want them to know
why he killed her.

1431
01:36:30,760 --> 01:36:32,840
There is someone in all this...

1432
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:35,040
...who is totally innocent
of any involvement...

1433
01:36:35,240 --> 01:36:37,080
...in the events of that night...

1434
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:41,920
...but whose life will be made infinitely
worse if I tell the truth at this time.

1435
01:36:42,920 --> 01:36:46,280
I wanna protect this person
from any further pain.

1436
01:36:49,200 --> 01:36:51,080
I promise you-

1437
01:36:51,640 --> 01:36:55,000
I promise you I will write down
the truth that I've learned...

1438
01:36:55,200 --> 01:36:58,080
...but I have to let matters lie
until this person has died...

1439
01:36:58,280 --> 01:37:00,360
...and the truth
can no longer touch them.

1440
01:37:05,360 --> 01:37:08,320
<i>I saw no indication on her face...</i>

1441
01:37:08,520 --> 01:37:11,000
<i>...that she knew
I was talking about her.</i>

1442
01:37:43,400 --> 01:37:45,880
You're a very special girl.

1443
01:37:53,680 --> 01:37:56,040
Forgive me.
