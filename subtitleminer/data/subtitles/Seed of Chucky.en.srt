00:02:41,066 --> 00:02:46,060
That's the ugliest thing
I've ever seen in my whole life.

2
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,708
It certainly is.
Who sent it?

3
00:02:51,811 --> 00:02:55,508
That's strange, it doesn't say.
Who could've come from?

4
00:02:55,948 --> 00:02:59,440
I don't like it.
It's staring at me.

5
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:01,946
It's probably one of
your uncle's jokes.

6
00:03:02,121 --> 00:03:03,918
I don't think it's funny
at all.

7
00:03:52,404 --> 00:03:54,804
<i>Darling, I'm just going
to have a shower.</i>

8
00:03:55,007 --> 00:03:57,168
<i>I'll be there in a minute.</i>

9
00:04:31,543 --> 00:04:35,809
Claudia, I told you not to leave
your toys laying about.

10
00:04:39,084 --> 00:04:42,019
Good God, you are hideous.

11
00:04:42,688 --> 00:04:44,986
<i>- Claudia?
- What?</i>

12
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:47,055
I had a bond with you,
young lady.

13
00:04:47,426 --> 00:04:50,953
We had an agreement, didn't we?
Didn't we?

14
00:04:51,096 --> 00:04:52,893
<i>But daddy, I didn't
leave it there.</i>

15
00:04:53,032 --> 00:04:56,331
In a civilized society,
our word is our bond.

16
00:04:56,568 --> 00:04:58,866
<i>I don't know what
you're talking about.</i>

17
00:04:59,004 --> 00:05:02,371
Just because it's your birthday,
doesn't mean you can...

18
00:05:33,305 --> 00:05:34,499
Richard?

19
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:37,372
Richard, what was that?

20
00:07:10,135 --> 00:07:12,865
You killed my mommy and daddy.

21
00:07:16,008 --> 00:07:19,535
And now you're pissing your pants,
you're pissing your pants...

22
00:07:19,678 --> 00:07:21,543
your pissing your pants!

23
00:07:24,483 --> 00:07:27,008
Wake up!
You're pissing your pants!

24
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:32,254
<i>And now,
ladies and gentlemen...</i>

25
00:07:32,691 --> 00:07:35,558
<i>what you've all
been waiting for!</i>

26
00:07:36,061 --> 00:07:37,790
<i>Shitface...</i>

27
00:07:37,963 --> 00:07:42,093
<i>and the greatest ventriloquist
in Europe!</i>

28
00:07:42,367 --> 00:07:45,700
<i>The psychotic Psychs!</i>

29
00:07:52,711 --> 00:07:53,973
<i>Come on!</i>

30
00:08:00,185 --> 00:08:02,551
This grotesque abomination...

31
00:08:03,222 --> 00:08:06,680
is not even anatomically correct.

32
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,896
Don't laugh,
it's a serious condition.

33
00:08:13,031 --> 00:08:16,330
Six years ago, I found him in
a cemetery back in the US...

34
00:08:16,468 --> 00:08:20,461
the little fucker tried
to rip me from hell.

35
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,437
I was trying to give you
a hug.

36
00:08:29,047 --> 00:08:31,038
<i>I don't know much
about myself.</i>

37
00:08:32,217 --> 00:08:35,618
<i>I know I'm an orphan,
I know I'm a freak...</i>

38
00:08:36,121 --> 00:08:38,919
<i>and of course,
I know that I'm Japanese.</i>

39
00:08:39,525 --> 00:08:43,017
<i>But why do I have such
terrible nightmares?</i>

40
00:08:43,629 --> 00:08:46,928
<i>Filled with rate and
blood and guts.</i>

41
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,991
<i>I'm not like that at all.</i>

42
00:08:50,903 --> 00:08:53,064
<i>I would even hurt a fly.</i>

43
00:08:53,472 --> 00:08:56,566
<i>There it goes,
back to his family.</i>

44
00:08:57,242 --> 00:08:58,800
<i>I envy him.</i>

45
00:08:59,545 --> 00:09:02,571
<i>Sometimes, I wonder about
my own parents.</i>

46
00:09:03,248 --> 00:09:05,011
<i>Were they Zen masters?</i>

47
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,150
<i>Did they serve the emperor?</i>

48
00:09:07,419 --> 00:09:11,378
<i>Sometimes I wonder what my mom
and dad were really like.</i>

49
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:21,324
So, you don't believe
in Santa Claus.

50
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:25,701
Trust me honey, tonight
I'm gonna make you believe.

51
00:09:26,104 --> 00:09:28,971
Wait to see what Santa is bringing
you, you naughty girl.

52
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:31,441
No, I can hear you fine,
you're not breaking up.

53
00:09:32,945 --> 00:09:34,936
Sheila I just said,
you're not breaking up.

54
00:09:39,284 --> 00:09:41,548
You're breaking up with me?

55
00:09:42,387 --> 00:09:45,788
Wait! You're breaking up
with me on Christmas's Eve?

56
00:09:46,091 --> 00:09:49,959
Sheila, you've got to be
fucking kidding me!

57
00:09:52,097 --> 00:09:54,190
That's just great.

58
00:11:00,699 --> 00:11:02,132
I knew it!

59
00:11:03,335 --> 00:11:05,326
You're not real!

60
00:11:11,677 --> 00:11:13,645
You were never real!

61
00:11:14,012 --> 00:11:17,504
You know what that kind of
disappointment can do to somebody?

62
00:11:17,783 --> 00:11:23,312
You have any idea how that
can fuck with your mind?

63
00:11:23,455 --> 00:11:27,448
Fuck with your mind?
Fuck with your mind?

64
00:11:27,626 --> 00:11:32,859
Fuck with your mind?
Fuck with your mind?

65
00:11:32,998 --> 00:11:36,456
Chucky broke again.
This is bloody ridiculous!

66
00:11:36,702 --> 00:11:38,670
Cut! Cut!

67
00:11:39,938 --> 00:11:41,633
<i>Thirty-four, take 1.</i>

68
00:11:42,774 --> 00:11:45,242
- Don't help me.
- Tony, what was that?

69
00:11:45,344 --> 00:11:47,812
- I'm sorry, it's...
- This is unprofessional...

70
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:51,246
- and I can't work like this.
- No Jason, I'm sorry! Wait!

71
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:54,078
We're here in Hollywood
where production is underway...

72
00:11:54,186 --> 00:11:56,746
on the new horror flick
"Chucky Goes Psycho".

73
00:11:56,922 --> 00:11:59,948
The film tell the urban legend
of Chucky and Tiffany.

74
00:12:00,158 --> 00:12:03,252
Two dolls supposedly possessed
by serial killers.

75
00:12:03,462 --> 00:12:06,158
The dolls were found in the scene
of real life murders...

76
00:12:06,264 --> 00:12:08,232
which remain unsolved
to this day.

77
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:14,796
Guys, I think Tiffany's
left arm is loose again.

78
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:22,340
I'm looking for Jennifer?
Does anyone have a 20 on Jennifer?

79
00:12:31,189 --> 00:12:34,056
Jennifer.
Got your skinny-quick.

80
00:12:35,394 --> 00:12:36,884
We're ready for you on set.

81
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:41,897
- Jennifer, I'm so proud of you.
- For what?

82
00:12:42,167 --> 00:12:46,399
- For sticking to your diet.
- Thank you.

83
00:12:52,377 --> 00:12:54,368
What's going on
in the world today?

84
00:12:55,614 --> 00:12:58,583
Julia Roberts is getting 25
million for her next film.

85
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:01,676
I'm so tired of hearing
about Julia Roberts.

86
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:04,186
You know, I should've
played Erin Brockovich.

87
00:13:04,289 --> 00:13:06,086
I could've done it
without the WonderBra.

88
00:13:06,191 --> 00:13:08,625
Julia stole that part right
out from under me.

89
00:13:08,727 --> 00:13:12,026
You know how? She slept with the
director, that's what I think.

90
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,560
Jennifer, you know
that's not true.

91
00:13:14,699 --> 00:13:17,327
How come I don't ever get
any of the good roles anymore?

92
00:13:17,469 --> 00:13:20,029
How come nobody
takes me seriously?

93
00:13:20,338 --> 00:13:22,602
- Nice tits.
- Thank you.

94
00:13:24,509 --> 00:13:26,977
Look at me, I'm an Oscar nominee,
for Christ's sake...

95
00:13:27,078 --> 00:13:28,773
and now I'm fucking a puppet.

96
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,543
Got no fan mail,
no paparazzi, no stalkers.

97
00:13:32,884 --> 00:13:35,045
There must be something
I'm right for.

98
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,210
Let's see...

99
00:13:39,391 --> 00:13:42,383
Hip Hop Superstar,
turned director Redman...

100
00:13:42,794 --> 00:13:45,661
is still looking for the right
actress to take the female lead...

101
00:13:45,764 --> 00:13:47,933
in his upcoming Bible epic.

102
00:13:47,933 --> 00:13:50,629
That sounds good.
What's the role?

103
00:13:52,938 --> 00:13:54,405
Virgin Mary.

104
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,274
- What's so funny?
- Nothing.

105
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:01,106
It's perfect! It's just what I need
to reinvent myself.

106
00:14:01,246 --> 00:14:05,046
The Virgin Mary. I always loved
the way she wears robes...

107
00:14:05,116 --> 00:14:08,142
her hair off her face,
kinda like this.

108
00:14:08,253 --> 00:14:10,551
Joan, get Morty on the phone...

109
00:14:10,789 --> 00:14:14,748
and tell him I need to have a meeting
with this Redman right away.

110
00:14:15,861 --> 00:14:19,126
<i>That's a wrap for Access Hollywood
reporting from Hollywood.</i>

111
00:14:19,331 --> 00:14:22,664
<i>For as you can see, Chucky
and Tiffany are alive and well.</i>

112
00:14:22,834 --> 00:14:25,894
<i>You can catch their movie in
theaters next Halloween.</i>

113
00:14:26,271 --> 00:14:27,533
<i>Thank you, Chucky.</i>

114
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,271
<i>Fuck you very much.</i>

115
00:14:37,749 --> 00:14:40,115
I'm not orphan after all.

116
00:14:42,821 --> 00:14:43,981
Well...

117
00:14:44,823 --> 00:14:47,519
you were shit last night...

118
00:14:47,659 --> 00:14:52,187
- you're gonna have to be more scary.
- Scary?

119
00:14:55,467 --> 00:14:58,334
Let's rehearse, shall we?

120
00:15:14,786 --> 00:15:16,117
Hello.

121
00:15:19,724 --> 00:15:24,127
Look, you gotta learn tapping
your killer instincts.

122
00:15:24,229 --> 00:15:28,757
Give in to your natural
impulses, or else I'll have to...

123
00:15:31,336 --> 00:15:32,735
fire your arm?

124
00:15:39,511 --> 00:15:40,500
Hey!

125
00:15:46,284 --> 00:15:49,981
Come here! Come here!

126
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:02,928
Come here!

127
00:16:52,917 --> 00:16:56,580
Mary, you're truly a vision
of solid innocence.

128
00:16:56,821 --> 00:17:00,450
Unique among all women,
as pure as the virgin snow...

129
00:17:00,659 --> 00:17:02,889
but I ask,
what is troubling you?

130
00:17:03,028 --> 00:17:07,089
Joseph, husband,
there's been a miracle.

131
00:17:07,332 --> 00:17:10,597
As I stand before you,
I must tell you...

132
00:17:10,969 --> 00:17:12,869
I'm with child.

133
00:17:13,138 --> 00:17:15,038
But Mary, how could this be?

134
00:17:15,473 --> 00:17:17,998
In accordance with God's whishes,
we never lay together...

135
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:20,810
as man and wife.

136
00:17:20,945 --> 00:17:25,780
Yes it is true, and I beg you
that you believe when I tell you...

137
00:17:25,984 --> 00:17:28,748
I've never lain with
any man at all.

138
00:17:29,287 --> 00:17:32,415
Do you believe me, Joseph?
Do you?

139
00:17:33,892 --> 00:17:36,554
- Do you?
- Yes, yes I do.

140
00:17:38,029 --> 00:17:41,692
- You're great. You're super.
- Thank you, Mr. Man.

141
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,665
Could I call you Red?

142
00:17:43,902 --> 00:17:47,030
There's a whole lot different ways
I can do it, not just the way you saw.

143
00:17:47,439 --> 00:17:52,570
I can do it faster, I can do it
slower, I could do it as a rap.

144
00:17:52,977 --> 00:17:54,808
No.

145
00:17:55,013 --> 00:17:58,676
You already showed me a side of the
character I've never seen before.

146
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,909
Thank you.

147
00:18:00,418 --> 00:18:03,046
But I think I'm gonna have
to go with my first choice.

148
00:18:03,621 --> 00:18:05,680
Thanks for coming by anyway.

149
00:18:05,824 --> 00:18:08,019
I'm a huge, huge fan...

150
00:18:08,093 --> 00:18:10,186
I really wanna work with you
one day, we should call you...

151
00:18:10,295 --> 00:18:13,287
Excuse me, I hope you don't
mind my asking but...

152
00:18:13,698 --> 00:18:16,895
- who is your first choice?
- Julia Roberts.

153
00:18:17,302 --> 00:18:18,737
But thanks for
coming by anyways.

154
00:18:18,737 --> 00:18:21,069
Listen Red...

155
00:18:21,873 --> 00:18:25,400
I've been giving a lot
of thought to this project...

156
00:18:25,577 --> 00:18:28,842
and I have a lot of interesting
ideas about the character...

157
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,713
and I was thinking maybe...

158
00:18:30,882 --> 00:18:37,446
you'd like to discuss it in a more
intimate setting. Just the 2 of us.

159
00:18:38,556 --> 00:18:42,925
Well, I didn't know you were that
passionate about the role.

160
00:18:43,194 --> 00:18:46,823
Yes, very passionate.

161
00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:52,599
So, shall we say, my place...

162
00:18:54,539 --> 00:18:56,268
eight 'o clock?

163
00:19:27,605 --> 00:19:28,663
Pardon me, sir.

164
00:19:33,478 --> 00:19:34,376
Sorry.

165
00:19:36,281 --> 00:19:37,942
Sorry, sir.

166
00:19:39,284 --> 00:19:42,776
Don't mind me.
Excuse me.

167
00:19:44,856 --> 00:19:46,016
Oh dear.

168
00:20:07,178 --> 00:20:08,406
Mom?

169
00:20:10,148 --> 00:20:11,376
Dad?

170
00:20:11,616 --> 00:20:13,982
I've dreamed of this moment
all my life.

171
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:17,386
I know this must come
as quite a shock.

172
00:20:18,223 --> 00:20:20,384
It's going to be an
adjustment for all of us.

173
00:20:24,128 --> 00:20:27,063
Look, I still have the
necklace you left me.

174
00:20:27,665 --> 00:20:30,634
I've always wanted to know,
what does this words mean?

175
00:20:31,202 --> 00:20:32,897
Is it our family motto?

176
00:20:34,205 --> 00:20:35,900
Please say something!

177
00:20:37,876 --> 00:20:40,811
It's because of the way
I look, isn't it?

178
00:20:42,447 --> 00:20:46,349
For pity's sake,
please wake up!

179
00:20:48,486 --> 00:20:50,215
Wake up.

180
00:20:52,523 --> 00:20:57,256
"Aguei Due Dambala. Awake!"

181
00:21:32,196 --> 00:21:35,256
- Tiff?
- Chucky?

182
00:21:38,269 --> 00:21:40,533
Who the hell are you?

183
00:21:41,139 --> 00:21:42,333
Shitface.

184
00:21:44,842 --> 00:21:47,140
Now what kind of a name
is that?

185
00:21:47,278 --> 00:21:49,303
Where are you mother
and father?

186
00:21:49,614 --> 00:21:52,583
Checking from that face,
my guess is they're hiding.

187
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,615
Shut up, you asshole.

188
00:21:54,819 --> 00:21:57,617
Come on, it looks like the kid
fell off the ugly tree...

189
00:21:57,755 --> 00:22:00,087
and hit every branch
on the way down.

190
00:22:03,227 --> 00:22:07,129
You gotta feel bad for the parents.
I wonder what they must look like.

191
00:22:15,406 --> 00:22:17,772
Oh my God.

192
00:22:29,821 --> 00:22:33,882
What? No you didn't...
we didn't...

193
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:39,655
Sweet Face, come to mommy!

194
00:22:50,074 --> 00:22:53,771
What's going on?
Where are we?

195
00:22:54,078 --> 00:22:57,138
In Hollywood.
I saw you on the TV.

196
00:22:57,482 --> 00:23:01,077
Chucky, wake up!
Look at us!

197
00:23:01,285 --> 00:23:05,483
We've had a make over!
We're movie stars!

198
00:23:07,992 --> 00:23:10,460
Shit! Barbie mode!

199
00:23:10,595 --> 00:23:14,326
They're puppets. They don't
walk and talk by themselves.

200
00:23:14,866 --> 00:23:18,927
Listen, if you want them to work,
I'm gonna have to take them apart.

201
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:40,714
Is mommy ill?

202
00:23:41,292 --> 00:23:42,987
The courts thought so.

203
00:24:14,158 --> 00:24:15,386
Heads up!

204
00:24:34,579 --> 00:24:36,547
I'll stop believing that.

205
00:24:56,067 --> 00:24:58,627
Hey, you're pissing your pants.

206
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:01,803
Chucky, she's just had
an accident.

207
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:06,637
You mean "he" had an accident.

208
00:25:10,248 --> 00:25:11,476
Don't look at me.

209
00:25:21,025 --> 00:25:24,188
See? What did I tell you?

210
00:25:24,428 --> 00:25:29,195
- A beautiful little girl.
- What? Are you blind?

211
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,892
That's my boy!

212
00:25:32,336 --> 00:25:35,828
It's just that he hasn't had
his growth spurt yet.

213
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:40,509
Don't worry about it, son.
You're a later bloomer, that's all.

214
00:25:40,645 --> 00:25:43,045
And it's high time
that you had a real name.

215
00:25:43,514 --> 00:25:46,972
Let's see, I'm gonna call you...

216
00:25:48,953 --> 00:25:50,079
Glen.

217
00:25:51,122 --> 00:25:54,819
Glen? What kind of name
is that for a girl?

218
00:25:54,992 --> 00:25:59,486
Don't listen to him, honey.
From now on, your name is...

219
00:26:00,164 --> 00:26:01,392
Glenda.

220
00:26:05,937 --> 00:26:07,234
Run, Glenda!

221
00:26:17,882 --> 00:26:19,850
Geez! What a mess!

222
00:26:27,992 --> 00:26:30,358
There you are, mister good bar.

223
00:26:47,745 --> 00:26:51,044
<i>Jennifer Tilly!</i>

224
00:27:05,496 --> 00:27:06,656
Hello!

225
00:27:13,004 --> 00:27:16,098
Oh my God!
You look so real.

226
00:27:17,341 --> 00:27:19,070
You look so real!

227
00:27:21,812 --> 00:27:24,246
You're cuter than
my last boyfriend.

228
00:27:24,649 --> 00:27:26,549
I think we make
a lovely couple.

229
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:45,933
Jennifer! Mrs. Tilly!
Were you having an affair with him?

230
00:27:46,103 --> 00:27:47,900
I don't know what
you're talking about.

231
00:27:49,206 --> 00:27:50,833
Pete Peters,
Celebrities Reveal.

232
00:27:51,008 --> 00:27:53,772
- Jennifer, what did you see?
- You want me to draw a picture?

233
00:27:53,878 --> 00:27:58,008
- Somebody give her a piece of paper!
- I'm not going to draw a picture.

234
00:27:58,115 --> 00:28:00,675
Don't feel bad, you're an
actress, not an artist, uh?

235
00:28:00,751 --> 00:28:02,309
What were you doing
when you saw the body?

236
00:28:03,187 --> 00:28:04,347
No comments.

237
00:28:04,722 --> 00:28:06,815
Jennifer, I love you.

238
00:28:08,359 --> 00:28:10,452
Jennifer, I love you.

239
00:28:13,497 --> 00:28:14,987
Is it true that you and
Redman talked about...

240
00:28:15,099 --> 00:28:16,726
you starring in his
new movie?

241
00:28:18,536 --> 00:28:21,994
- Yes, as a matter of fact, I...
- Can I have your autograph?

242
00:28:23,174 --> 00:28:24,607
Okay, sure.

243
00:28:25,609 --> 00:28:27,907
<i>We've heard about
your obsession with chocolate.</i>

244
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,484
Hey, hold on,
you forgot the head.

245
00:28:38,556 --> 00:28:39,256
Excuse me, excuse me.

246
00:28:39,256 --> 00:28:39,984
<i>Jennifer, how old
are you really?</i>

247
00:28:40,057 --> 00:28:43,720
<i>- Paparazzi scum bag!
- What year were you born?</i>

248
00:28:43,861 --> 00:28:46,193
- I want the set of the film, okay?
- Sure.

249
00:28:48,332 --> 00:28:50,892
<i>What are you hiding?</i>

250
00:28:54,939 --> 00:28:59,205
- Are you okay?
- I am now.

251
00:29:16,193 --> 00:29:19,560
So are you a pair
of ninja assassins?

252
00:29:21,198 --> 00:29:23,530
Are you hit men for the Yakuza?

253
00:29:23,667 --> 00:29:27,125
We're not from Japan.
We're from Jersey.

254
00:29:27,471 --> 00:29:31,532
Just think. Jennifer Tilly
is playing me in a movie.

255
00:29:31,742 --> 00:29:35,371
- It's absolutely perfect casting.
- But that voice?

256
00:29:35,613 --> 00:29:39,709
I know, she sounds
just like an angel.

257
00:29:40,151 --> 00:29:42,244
Now I've got it all
figured it out.

258
00:29:42,686 --> 00:29:44,711
I'm gonna transfer my soul
into Jennifer...

259
00:29:44,855 --> 00:29:47,688
and you're gonna transfer your
soul into Redman.

260
00:29:47,892 --> 00:29:49,154
I'm down with that.

261
00:29:49,293 --> 00:29:51,818
We'll diss these plastic bodies
once and for all...

262
00:29:51,962 --> 00:29:54,453
and we'll be Hollywood's
hottest couple!

263
00:29:54,732 --> 00:29:57,064
- What about me?
- Don't worry, Glenda.

264
00:29:57,234 --> 00:29:59,168
I've got that
figured it out too.

265
00:29:59,437 --> 00:30:02,531
You are going to be
a real life girl.

266
00:30:02,606 --> 00:30:04,233
- Boy.
- How?

267
00:30:04,408 --> 00:30:08,504
Well, I'm not getting pregnant
again, I'll tell you that much.

268
00:30:08,712 --> 00:30:10,145
My mother always told me...

269
00:30:10,414 --> 00:30:13,247
"once is a blessing,
twice is a curse. "

270
00:30:13,517 --> 00:30:15,610
That would explain your sister.

271
00:30:15,786 --> 00:30:19,153
The only sensible option
is a surrogate mother.

272
00:30:30,634 --> 00:30:34,229
- I have something important...
- Hold on a second, sweetheart.

273
00:30:38,809 --> 00:30:41,073
<i>- Hello?
- What are you doing?</i>

274
00:30:41,212 --> 00:30:42,440
I'm busy.

275
00:30:44,348 --> 00:30:47,943
<i>- I do have a life, you know?
- Turn on the news.</i>

276
00:30:50,788 --> 00:30:52,779
<i>We have discovered
the victim's body.</i>

277
00:30:52,923 --> 00:30:55,414
<i>As of yet there's no
official confirmation...</i>

278
00:30:55,526 --> 00:30:58,017
<i>as to whether or not
Mrs. Tilly is a suspect</i>

279
00:30:58,162 --> 00:31:00,027
<i>- Jesus!
- Can you believe it?</i>

280
00:31:00,164 --> 00:31:01,461
Are you okay?

281
00:31:02,566 --> 00:31:04,261
I've had better days.

282
00:31:04,602 --> 00:31:06,331
Listen Joan, I need you
to do something for me.

283
00:31:06,437 --> 00:31:08,302
I need you to get me
a bottle of champagne...

284
00:31:08,539 --> 00:31:10,006
and bring it by my house.

285
00:31:10,674 --> 00:31:11,766
<i>What for?</i>

286
00:31:15,112 --> 00:31:16,739
I've got a big night tonight.

287
00:31:16,881 --> 00:31:19,213
<i>Tonight? With who?</i>

288
00:31:20,017 --> 00:31:21,177
Redman.

289
00:31:23,487 --> 00:31:26,888
- Jennifer, what are you up to?
- Thank you, Joan.

290
00:31:30,728 --> 00:31:35,358
Come on, Stan. It's just business.
He'll be outta there by midnight.

291
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:43,401
Oh my God!
She's a complete slut!

292
00:32:00,224 --> 00:32:02,920
Good night, Glenda.
Sleep tight.

293
00:32:04,261 --> 00:32:05,319
Leave it on.

294
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:10,188
Oh sweetie.
There's nothing to be scared of.

295
00:32:10,501 --> 00:32:12,833
Your dad and I will be
right here.

296
00:32:17,575 --> 00:32:19,270
Why do you kill people?

297
00:32:20,678 --> 00:32:21,804
Excuse me?

298
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,170
Why do you kill?

299
00:32:28,485 --> 00:32:31,655
It's a hobby, really.
It helps us relax.

300
00:32:31,655 --> 00:32:33,520
Am I going to be a killer?

301
00:32:33,591 --> 00:32:37,288
Of course! It's been a family
tradition for generations!

302
00:32:37,595 --> 00:32:41,429
But violence is bad, isn't it?
They said so on TV.

303
00:32:41,699 --> 00:32:46,602
Not violence. Violins.
Violins are bad.

304
00:32:46,837 --> 00:32:49,772
That scrutchy music is gonna
ruin the godamn country.

305
00:32:50,474 --> 00:32:51,964
Chucky, Glenda is right.

306
00:32:52,142 --> 00:32:54,110
It's time we owned up to it.

307
00:32:54,278 --> 00:32:56,974
We have a problem with killing.

308
00:32:57,181 --> 00:33:00,412
I don't have a "problem"
with killing.

309
00:33:00,751 --> 00:33:04,517
I like a little killing now and
then. What's wrong with that?

310
00:33:04,655 --> 00:33:08,352
Killing is an addiction
like any other drug.

311
00:33:08,592 --> 00:33:12,824
But we're parents now.
We have to set a good example.

312
00:33:14,798 --> 00:33:18,632
Let's quit, Chucky.
Right now!

313
00:33:19,069 --> 00:33:21,128
You have got to be kidding.

314
00:33:21,505 --> 00:33:23,735
Promise me, Chucky,
no more killing.

315
00:33:23,841 --> 00:33:24,865
- No.
- Chucky.

316
00:33:24,975 --> 00:33:27,068
- No, no...
- No more killing!

317
00:33:27,177 --> 00:33:28,576
- No, no...
- We can't do it anymore!

318
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:30,340
- No, no...
- We have the future to think of!

319
00:33:30,481 --> 00:33:31,880
- No, no!
- We have a child!

320
00:33:32,016 --> 00:33:36,009
Fine! Alright already!
I promise.

321
00:33:37,021 --> 00:33:40,081
Thank you, doll baby.
You're a sweetheart.

322
00:33:40,257 --> 00:33:43,693
Now we really will be
the perfect family.

323
00:33:51,402 --> 00:33:52,494
Did you hear that?

324
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:56,369
Maybe you should forget the director
and fuck the exterminator instead.

325
00:33:57,574 --> 00:34:00,771
So how do I look? Never mind.

326
00:34:01,045 --> 00:34:03,343
Jennifer, this is beneath you.

327
00:34:03,681 --> 00:34:06,775
Think about what you're doing.
What the people are gonna say?

328
00:34:06,917 --> 00:34:08,885
Who cares what people will say?

329
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,853
- Don't you see how evil this is?
- I don't wanna hear it.

330
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:16,523
You're prostituting yourself
so you can play the Virgin Mary.

331
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:18,760
Joan, I don't wanna hear it.

332
00:34:19,463 --> 00:34:22,364
This is so evil.
You're going to hell.

333
00:34:22,499 --> 00:34:25,525
No, hell would be ending up
on "Celebrity Fear Factor"...

334
00:34:25,669 --> 00:34:28,638
in a worm-eating contest
with Ann and Nicole Smith.

335
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:31,132
Which you'd win.

336
00:34:36,113 --> 00:34:39,412
- He's here.
- Let yourself out the back.

337
00:34:41,151 --> 00:34:44,052
And while you're at it,
leave your key on the counter.

338
00:34:44,855 --> 00:34:48,757
- What are you saying?
- You think I'm so disgusting...

339
00:34:48,959 --> 00:34:50,790
you think I'm going to hell.

340
00:34:51,462 --> 00:34:53,487
I'm only trying
to survive here, Joan.

341
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:55,860
God knows I wouldn't wanna
drag you down with me.

342
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:58,395
I'm saying you're fired.

343
00:35:12,082 --> 00:35:14,983
I'm gonna get that ass...

344
00:35:22,025 --> 00:35:25,722
Now in artificial insemination,
timing is everything...

345
00:35:25,829 --> 00:35:29,287
so you have to hurry. That
shouldn't be a problem for you.

346
00:35:29,867 --> 00:35:33,234
Yeah, just don't let that player
get into her pants.

347
00:35:33,437 --> 00:35:35,234
I don't want him touching
my woman...

348
00:35:35,339 --> 00:35:37,807
- until I'm him, and you're her.
- Right.

349
00:35:43,914 --> 00:35:47,577
Hey, aren't you gonna give me
a hand here?

350
00:36:01,765 --> 00:36:03,323
Too tall.

351
00:36:04,701 --> 00:36:06,168
Lesbos!

352
00:36:09,406 --> 00:36:10,373
Done her.

353
00:36:15,179 --> 00:36:17,113
Here we go!

354
00:36:18,215 --> 00:36:20,911
Come to papa!

355
00:37:02,893 --> 00:37:04,155
Cheers!

356
00:37:05,529 --> 00:37:09,226
You know, I wasn't bullshitting
when I told you I was a fan.

357
00:37:09,399 --> 00:37:11,526
That's so sweet, Redman.

358
00:37:11,902 --> 00:37:13,870
Which of my films
is your favorite?

359
00:37:14,037 --> 00:37:16,232
That movie where you and
that chick were making out.

360
00:37:16,373 --> 00:37:19,968
"Bound".
Everybody likes that one.

361
00:37:20,077 --> 00:37:21,942
- You're still in touch with her?
- Gina?

362
00:37:22,112 --> 00:37:23,773
Yeah, we're friends.

363
00:37:24,448 --> 00:37:25,506
Close friends.

364
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:28,384
Very close friends.

365
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:33,112
Maybe the three of us
can hang out together sometime.

366
00:37:34,524 --> 00:37:37,891
- I'd really like that a lot.
- Okay.

367
00:37:38,328 --> 00:37:41,491
- I'll see if I can make it happen.
- The bottom is up, baby.

368
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:46,736
Redman, I was wondering...

369
00:37:47,471 --> 00:37:50,372
what's gonna take to make you
seem me as a Virgin?

370
00:37:51,275 --> 00:37:53,300
Well, you tell me!

371
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:28,635
A masturbating midget?

372
00:38:36,753 --> 00:38:38,414
Get it, Mini-Me!

373
00:38:53,136 --> 00:38:55,969
Sweet Jesus!
God bless the little people!

374
00:38:59,843 --> 00:39:02,903
- I don't know if I can do this?
- Why not?

375
00:39:04,181 --> 00:39:07,639
- What will people say?
- Fuck what people will say!

376
00:39:07,784 --> 00:39:10,344
You know what I'm saying?
This was meant to be, for real.

377
00:39:10,687 --> 00:39:13,713
You know how I know? 'Cause
the man upstairs told me so.

378
00:39:14,024 --> 00:39:15,855
- Really?
- Hell yeah!

379
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:20,289
Mel Gibson ain't the only one God's
been talking to in Hollywood.

380
00:39:20,464 --> 00:39:24,025
And He personally told me,
that you was my Virgin.

381
00:39:31,074 --> 00:39:32,598
What the hell?

382
00:39:39,649 --> 00:39:40,673
Pig!

383
00:39:41,651 --> 00:39:45,781
And you should be
ashamed yourself.

384
00:39:45,922 --> 00:39:48,254
Where's your self-respect?

385
00:39:48,558 --> 00:39:51,823
You know what my mother
used to say about dirty girls?

386
00:39:52,162 --> 00:39:58,067
She said "You can always smell
it on the girls who sell it".

387
00:39:59,002 --> 00:40:02,130
By the way, can I have
your autograph?

388
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:03,763
I'm a big fan.

389
00:40:10,781 --> 00:40:12,874
What am I supposed to do
with this?

390
00:40:28,131 --> 00:40:31,066
Mrs. Tilly, I know
you're frightened.

391
00:40:31,168 --> 00:40:34,763
You're probably even wondering
if you've gone completely insane.

392
00:40:35,105 --> 00:40:37,972
But I promise you, tomorrow
you're going to wake up...

393
00:40:38,075 --> 00:40:40,509
and this will all seem
just like a bad dream.

394
00:40:41,144 --> 00:40:42,270
In the mean time...

395
00:40:42,446 --> 00:40:47,281
we can do this the easy way,
or the hard way.

396
00:40:48,785 --> 00:40:50,810
It's really up to you.

397
00:40:58,361 --> 00:41:00,727
No wonder the girl
is always in trouble.

398
00:41:05,001 --> 00:41:08,562
Check it out.
Look at the size of his feet.

399
00:41:09,339 --> 00:41:10,863
You know what they say.

400
00:41:12,242 --> 00:41:13,709
Geez, she's fat.

401
00:41:14,945 --> 00:41:17,607
I can't believe it, she's not
even pregnant yet.

402
00:41:24,287 --> 00:41:25,982
Paparazzi scum bag!

403
00:41:36,066 --> 00:41:37,966
Looks like you've got
everything under control.

404
00:41:38,068 --> 00:41:39,899
I'll just leave you to it.

405
00:41:45,575 --> 00:41:48,874
Motherhood is so beautiful.

406
00:41:55,685 --> 00:41:58,950
No, no...

407
00:42:12,035 --> 00:42:14,936
Sorry, just messing with you.

408
00:42:15,205 --> 00:42:16,570
What time is it?

409
00:42:19,876 --> 00:42:21,867
Time to get dressed.

410
00:42:22,679 --> 00:42:26,809
We're gonna have our own boys'
night out, just you and me.

411
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:29,578
- How does that sound?
- Where are we going?

412
00:42:30,187 --> 00:42:31,711
Hunting.

413
00:42:38,828 --> 00:42:43,094
I can't see anything.
Maybe we should slow down?

414
00:42:43,266 --> 00:42:45,496
Now, you're doing great!

415
00:42:54,211 --> 00:42:56,008
Son of a bitch!

416
00:42:58,915 --> 00:43:01,440
- Up yours, asshole!
- What?

417
00:43:01,651 --> 00:43:04,586
Not you, son.
Come on, floor it!

418
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:23,100
<i>Ops! I did it again!</i>

419
00:44:10,387 --> 00:44:12,548
Jesus Christ!

420
00:44:53,663 --> 00:44:56,029
No!

421
00:45:19,556 --> 00:45:22,992
- Oughta a boy!
- No, I didn't...

422
00:45:23,093 --> 00:45:25,687
And I thought you
weren't ready, kid!

423
00:45:25,862 --> 00:45:28,330
You're a fucking natural!

424
00:45:28,732 --> 00:45:30,529
But he hit the shelf!

425
00:45:30,967 --> 00:45:33,902
And don't worry about your
mother, it'll be our little secret.

426
00:45:40,510 --> 00:45:42,978
Say "cheese".

427
00:46:04,567 --> 00:46:05,591
Good morning.

428
00:46:07,070 --> 00:46:08,264
Hi.

429
00:46:09,339 --> 00:46:11,739
We must have really gotten
wild last night.

430
00:46:13,810 --> 00:46:15,744
Redman, did we...?

431
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:20,147
- You don't remember?
- No, it's all blur.

432
00:46:21,418 --> 00:46:25,149
- What about you?
- I remember you screaming a lot.

433
00:46:25,989 --> 00:46:28,219
I seem to remember that too.

434
00:46:28,358 --> 00:46:31,088
I have that effect on women.

435
00:46:31,895 --> 00:46:33,829
- Really?
- Yeah.

436
00:46:35,698 --> 00:46:39,156
Wait, I do remember.

437
00:46:40,103 --> 00:46:42,094
I had the strangest dream.

438
00:46:43,072 --> 00:46:45,632
I dreamt my guardian angel
came to me.

439
00:46:46,409 --> 00:46:49,640
She had the sweetest voice
I've ever heard.

440
00:46:50,213 --> 00:46:52,511
She told me
to respect myself...

441
00:46:53,883 --> 00:46:55,976
and then she asked for
my autograph.

442
00:46:57,153 --> 00:47:01,214
Let' see, step number one,
admit I have an addiction.

443
00:47:01,558 --> 00:47:03,150
Okay, check.

444
00:47:03,293 --> 00:47:07,525
Step number two, give myself
over to a higher power?

445
00:47:08,131 --> 00:47:09,223
Whatever.

446
00:47:14,037 --> 00:47:15,299
Here we go.

447
00:47:15,538 --> 00:47:19,804
Step number nine:
The recovering addict...

448
00:47:19,909 --> 00:47:24,539
must make amendments to anyone
he or she has harmed.

449
00:47:35,592 --> 00:47:39,221
<i>- Hello?
- Good morning. Is this Ruth Bailey?</i>

450
00:47:39,329 --> 00:47:42,093
<i>- Speaking.
- The widow of Robert Bailey?</i>

451
00:47:42,565 --> 00:47:45,466
<i>- Yes, who is this?
- Mrs. Bailey...</i>

452
00:47:45,668 --> 00:47:47,602
my name's Tiffany Ray.

453
00:47:48,037 --> 00:47:51,529
You don't know me, but a few
years ago I killed your husband.

454
00:47:51,674 --> 00:47:55,041
And I'm so very sorry.

455
00:47:55,211 --> 00:47:57,304
<i>Is this some kind of sick joke?</i>

456
00:47:57,447 --> 00:48:00,610
No, I'm completely serious.

457
00:48:00,683 --> 00:48:02,173
But I want you to know...

458
00:48:02,318 --> 00:48:06,618
I'm recovering now and
I've put all of that behind me.

459
00:48:06,756 --> 00:48:10,248
<i>I don't know who you are,
but...</i>

460
00:48:10,593 --> 00:48:13,960
Thank you Mrs. Bailey,
have a nice day.

461
00:48:16,633 --> 00:48:18,362
I feel better already.

462
00:48:33,182 --> 00:48:34,547
Good morning, Stan.

463
00:48:35,618 --> 00:48:38,086
What is so important
you wanted to tell me?

464
00:48:39,856 --> 00:48:43,952
Well, the things is, Jennifer...

465
00:48:50,166 --> 00:48:53,431
I'm sorry, I don't know
what's got into me.

466
00:48:55,605 --> 00:48:57,004
So you were saying...

467
00:48:59,042 --> 00:49:01,840
- Forget it.
- Okay.

468
00:49:05,148 --> 00:49:08,140
Now, let's see...

469
00:49:08,651 --> 00:49:11,620
what should we do today?

470
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:38,677
I'm pregnant.

471
00:49:41,317 --> 00:49:43,785
Redman, I said I'm pregnant.

472
00:49:45,088 --> 00:49:47,147
Congratulations.
Who's the baby's daddy?

473
00:49:49,959 --> 00:49:51,324
Don't even look at me.

474
00:49:52,095 --> 00:49:53,619
I haven't slept with anyone else...

475
00:49:53,696 --> 00:49:55,527
to advance my career lately.

476
00:49:55,698 --> 00:49:58,496
- Who are you kidding?
- It's true, Redman, look.

477
00:49:59,636 --> 00:50:04,266
I know I come off all sluty,
but that's for my image.

478
00:50:04,674 --> 00:50:07,234
You think anyone would cast me
in these sexy roles...

479
00:50:07,477 --> 00:50:09,877
if they knew I hadn't been
laid in a year?

480
00:50:10,713 --> 00:50:13,045
I haven't even slept
with my driver yet...

481
00:50:13,383 --> 00:50:15,112
and I think he really likes me.

482
00:50:15,518 --> 00:50:19,420
That's all very touchy and shit,
but I'm telling you it can't be me.

483
00:50:19,956 --> 00:50:20,980
Why not?

484
00:50:21,257 --> 00:50:23,384
I had a vasectomy as soon as
I got to Hollywood.

485
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:24,991
I ain't no idiot.

486
00:50:25,695 --> 00:50:29,791
- That's impossible, because...
- Hey, Jennifer.

487
00:50:30,199 --> 00:50:31,257
I hate to break it to you...

488
00:50:31,534 --> 00:50:34,094
but I can't hire you
if you're pregnant.

489
00:50:34,370 --> 00:50:37,635
That's ridiculous.
The character is pregnant.

490
00:50:37,807 --> 00:50:42,369
I know, but I have a very
specific vision of Mary.

491
00:50:42,612 --> 00:50:46,378
What can I say?
She's gotta be hot.

492
00:50:51,988 --> 00:50:53,979
That pig!

493
00:51:13,176 --> 00:51:15,644
<i>- Recovery Hotline.
- Yes, I'm in recovery.</i>

494
00:51:15,878 --> 00:51:18,711
And I'm afraid I'm going
to have a slip.

495
00:51:18,981 --> 00:51:23,475
<i>- Can you get to a meeting?
- No, it's really not an option.</i>

496
00:51:23,753 --> 00:51:27,814
<i>- I just freak everybody out.
- Don't be so hard on yourself.</i>

497
00:51:28,091 --> 00:51:29,558
<i>We're not here to judge you.
What's your name?</i>

498
00:51:29,826 --> 00:51:32,226
<i>- Tiffany.
- Listen to me, Tiffany.</i>

499
00:51:32,562 --> 00:51:35,827
<i>- I know what you're going through.
- You do?</i>

500
00:51:36,099 --> 00:51:39,591
<i>Yes, I do. In fact, I'm gonna
let you in a little secret.</i>

501
00:51:39,836 --> 00:51:42,236
<i>- Just last week I had a slip.
- Really?</i>

502
00:51:42,572 --> 00:51:45,939
<i>Yeah, and believe me,
it was not pretty.</i>

503
00:51:46,242 --> 00:51:48,335
<i>- It never is, is it?
- No.</i>

504
00:51:48,611 --> 00:51:51,409
<i>In fact it took me three hours
just to clean up the mess.</i>

505
00:51:52,248 --> 00:51:55,411
Oh God, don't remind me.

506
00:51:56,152 --> 00:51:58,177
<i>But I'm not beating myself
over it.</i>

507
00:51:58,387 --> 00:52:00,116
<i>- You know why, Tiffany?
- Why?</i>

508
00:52:00,690 --> 00:52:04,023
<i>Because Rome wasn't built
in a day.</i>

509
00:52:05,695 --> 00:52:10,826
You're right.
You're absolutely right.

510
00:52:20,042 --> 00:52:24,775
<i>Hello?
Speaking. Who's this?</i>

511
00:52:25,648 --> 00:52:30,585
<i>I understand who you are, I just
don't know how you got my number.</i>

512
00:52:30,787 --> 00:52:33,813
<i>Because it's a private number.</i>

513
00:52:35,091 --> 00:52:39,118
<i>Pete Peters?
Yeah, I saw him yesterday.</i>

514
00:52:40,062 --> 00:52:42,496
<i>I don't have any relationship
with him.</i>

515
00:52:42,799 --> 00:52:45,700
<i>He's a paparazzi who
started taking pictures of me...</i>

516
00:52:46,035 --> 00:52:47,696
<i>in compromising positions.</i>

517
00:52:48,704 --> 00:52:53,300
<i>Redman is a director...
Oh yeah...</i>

518
00:52:53,676 --> 00:53:00,081
<i>he's a rapper too...
he's a rapper director, okay?</i>

519
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:05,382
Bye-bye.

520
00:53:08,791 --> 00:53:10,520
Jennifer.

521
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:13,090
Do you mind?
I'm on the phone.

522
00:53:22,171 --> 00:53:23,900
There's been another murder.

523
00:53:24,173 --> 00:53:26,334
What? I told where I was.

524
00:53:26,609 --> 00:53:28,941
I was right here all night
with Redman.

525
00:53:29,612 --> 00:53:32,479
<i>What? I don't...</i>

526
00:53:33,216 --> 00:53:36,083
<i>You're not telling me I'm
a suspect, are you?</i>

527
00:53:37,987 --> 00:53:40,922
<i>Okay. Alright.
I'm on my way.</i>

528
00:53:41,858 --> 00:53:44,326
I'm leaving.
You can let yourself out.

529
00:53:44,594 --> 00:53:48,189
By the way Redman,
drop dead.

530
00:53:54,537 --> 00:54:00,635
Glenda, honey,
everything is okay.

531
00:54:00,910 --> 00:54:05,347
It was just a little slip.
No need to tell your daddy.

532
00:54:05,581 --> 00:54:08,982
It'll be our little secret, okay?

533
00:54:21,898 --> 00:54:24,264
<i>It's "D" day here
in San Quentin.</i>

534
00:54:24,533 --> 00:54:26,558
<i>Who would've thought
it would ever come to this?</i>

535
00:54:26,903 --> 00:54:29,667
They're executing Martha Stewart
this morning.

536
00:54:31,073 --> 00:54:34,565
I don't think I can take
nine months of this shit.

537
00:54:35,011 --> 00:54:40,415
Silly Chucky. It's a voodoo
pregnancy. It's accelerated.

538
00:54:40,650 --> 00:54:42,584
How accelerated?

539
00:54:42,852 --> 00:54:45,548
<i>It's 102,7 Kiss FM, LA's number
one music station.</i>

540
00:54:45,888 --> 00:54:50,154
<i>Ryan Seacrest, Ally Kay "I don't
know if I can't take it" on the way.</i>

541
00:54:50,426 --> 00:54:54,556
<i>We have bad weather on the way,
LA, Hollywood.</i>

542
00:54:54,830 --> 00:54:56,730
<i>Bad weather? We're not
used to bad weather.</i>

543
00:54:56,999 --> 00:54:58,432
<i>No, we're not.</i>

544
00:54:58,734 --> 00:55:01,703
<i>I'm pretty sure it's gonna
affect my whole life.</i>

545
00:55:03,205 --> 00:55:07,107
<i>I'd like to hear more reports
on the weather...</i>

546
00:55:20,990 --> 00:55:21,718
<i>This is Joan.</i>

547
00:55:21,958 --> 00:55:25,325
Joan, I'm fat.

548
00:55:25,628 --> 00:55:28,995
- You're not fat.
- No, I'm fat, I'm huge!

549
00:55:29,298 --> 00:55:31,528
For the love of Mary,
I'm pregnant.

550
00:55:31,767 --> 00:55:33,701
- Oh my God.
- No, I should've listened to you.

551
00:55:34,003 --> 00:55:36,733
You said it was evil
and I was going to hell.

552
00:55:37,039 --> 00:55:39,473
You're right and
now God is punishing me.

553
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:43,905
- My God. Is it Redman's?
- No, it's definitely not Redman's.

554
00:55:44,146 --> 00:55:45,113
- What?
- What?

555
00:55:45,348 --> 00:55:48,044
It's definitely not Redman's.
What an asshole!

556
00:55:48,284 --> 00:55:50,218
- What makes you say that?
- Say what?

557
00:55:50,553 --> 00:55:53,522
- That Redman's is an asshole.
- I didn't say, you did.

558
00:55:53,723 --> 00:55:55,657
- No I didn't.
- So he's not an asshole?

559
00:55:55,925 --> 00:55:59,258
- Yes he is.
- Joan, will you stop doing that?

560
00:55:59,528 --> 00:56:02,520
- Doing what?
- Imitating, I don't sound like that!

561
00:56:02,765 --> 00:56:04,858
Yes you do! I do!

562
00:56:05,134 --> 00:56:10,572
Joan, shut up! There's something
wrong with me, I'm pregnant, I...

563
00:56:11,907 --> 00:56:13,534
Jennifer, what's wrong?

564
00:56:14,443 --> 00:56:16,638
Nothing, I'm fine.

565
00:56:16,912 --> 00:56:20,473
I heard you scream.
I can still hear you screaming.

566
00:56:22,051 --> 00:56:24,884
It's just, "Bound"
is on cable.

567
00:56:25,154 --> 00:56:27,520
Gina Gershon is fingering me.

568
00:56:29,325 --> 00:56:31,555
<i>I love this movie, don't you?</i>

569
00:56:33,896 --> 00:56:34,760
Jennifer?

570
00:56:34,997 --> 00:56:38,933
Yeah, that's really interesting,
but I gotta go. Bye.

571
00:56:40,136 --> 00:56:41,398
Jennifer?

572
00:56:43,973 --> 00:56:45,941
- Too tight?
- Yes.

573
00:56:46,909 --> 00:56:49,241
Ain't no such thing.

574
00:56:53,215 --> 00:56:56,275
What are you doing? Stop it!

575
00:56:57,286 --> 00:56:59,151
What the hell is going on
in here?

576
00:57:00,656 --> 00:57:03,250
She came on to me.

577
00:57:03,426 --> 00:57:06,452
- Help me! Somebody help me!
- Shut up, asshole!

578
00:57:07,396 --> 00:57:10,593
Somebody help me!

579
00:57:11,333 --> 00:57:13,096
Somebody help me!

580
00:57:19,942 --> 00:57:21,569
What the hell is this?

581
00:57:21,877 --> 00:57:23,708
We had an agreement, Chucky!

582
00:57:23,846 --> 00:57:26,406
We decided,
for the sake of our child...

583
00:57:26,515 --> 00:57:29,643
we weren't gonna do
this shit anymore.

584
00:57:29,785 --> 00:57:31,650
No, you decided!

585
00:57:31,754 --> 00:57:35,155
Just like you decided
our son was a girl.

586
00:57:35,257 --> 00:57:38,021
- He is a girl!
- He's a boy, godamn it!

587
00:57:38,127 --> 00:57:42,223
And he's the most promising
killer I've ever seen.

588
00:57:42,331 --> 00:57:44,299
You should've been there, Tiff.

589
00:57:44,433 --> 00:57:46,628
You would've been
so proud of him.

590
00:57:46,702 --> 00:57:49,603
- I want a girl!
- I want a boy!

591
00:57:49,772 --> 00:57:52,206
You're tearing me apart!

592
00:57:52,441 --> 00:57:55,069
What about what I want?

593
00:57:55,878 --> 00:57:57,209
- What?
- What?

594
00:57:57,379 --> 00:58:00,348
Doesn't what I want
mean anything at all?

595
00:58:02,118 --> 00:58:05,053
Okay, interesting. Tell us.

596
00:58:05,287 --> 00:58:07,380
What do you want, Sweet Face?

597
00:58:08,023 --> 00:58:12,016
I think I want to be a boy.

598
00:58:12,194 --> 00:58:15,322
Yes! In your face, lady!

599
00:58:15,898 --> 00:58:18,867
But being a girl would be
nice too.

600
00:58:20,603 --> 00:58:23,538
- Well, which is it?
- I'm not sure.

601
00:58:23,672 --> 00:58:25,435
Sometimes I feel like a boy...

602
00:58:25,841 --> 00:58:27,604
sometimes I feel like a girl.

603
00:58:29,512 --> 00:58:30,740
Can I be both?

604
00:58:30,913 --> 00:58:34,974
- Well, some people...
- No way!

605
00:58:35,151 --> 00:58:37,051
But one thing I do know
for sure.

606
00:58:37,620 --> 00:58:39,884
I don't want to be a killer.

607
00:58:40,122 --> 00:58:44,081
Glenda, Glen, whatever.

608
00:58:44,226 --> 00:58:46,251
I'm so proud of you.

609
00:58:46,328 --> 00:58:48,091
No matter what happens...

610
00:58:48,197 --> 00:58:51,963
we'll deal with it together,
as a family.

611
00:58:52,101 --> 00:58:53,568
Okay, Tiff-san.

612
00:58:55,137 --> 00:58:56,229
Wait a minute!

613
00:58:56,505 --> 00:58:59,235
I'm not gonna let you poison
our son's mind...

614
00:58:59,341 --> 00:59:02,208
with your touchy-feely
twelve-step bullshit.

615
00:59:02,511 --> 00:59:05,105
If you two don't wanna kill
anymore, that's your loss.

616
00:59:05,247 --> 00:59:08,307
But don't look down
your noses at me.

617
00:59:08,551 --> 00:59:12,112
I'm not ashamed to be a killer,
I'm proud of it.

618
00:59:12,454 --> 00:59:15,446
It's not an addiction,
it's a choice.

619
00:59:15,758 --> 00:59:19,660
And it's not something that you
should have to hide in the closet.

620
00:59:26,802 --> 00:59:29,327
- Oh dear!
- Oh God!

621
00:59:31,740 --> 00:59:34,004
Well, well, well...

622
00:59:34,109 --> 00:59:39,274
Looks like Ms. High and Mighty
ain't so perfect after all.

623
00:59:39,448 --> 00:59:41,245
It was just a little slip.

624
00:59:41,383 --> 00:59:43,851
Rome wasn't built in a day,
you know?

625
00:59:44,486 --> 00:59:47,250
Besides, the fucker
really had it coming.

626
00:59:53,028 --> 00:59:55,929
- And what about my body?
- I'll take care of it.

627
01:00:03,038 --> 01:00:06,337
Jennifer, I love you.
Jennifer, I love you.

628
01:00:06,675 --> 01:00:08,074
I love you.

629
01:00:10,279 --> 01:00:14,909
- This is Stan.
- Hello. It's Jennifer.

630
01:00:16,151 --> 01:00:19,848
<i>Baby, I need your body.</i>

631
01:00:20,889 --> 01:00:22,379
I'll be right there.

632
01:00:29,865 --> 01:00:32,857
Jennifer, if anything happens to
me I want you to know...

633
01:00:37,339 --> 01:00:40,240
They really do make a cute couple,
don't you think?

634
01:00:40,476 --> 01:00:41,943
It's like my mother
always said...

635
01:00:42,044 --> 01:00:45,036
Christ! Enough with your
mother already!

636
01:00:45,180 --> 01:00:48,308
I killed that bitch twenty years
ago and she still won't shut up.

637
01:00:53,989 --> 01:00:57,152
There, there, won't be
long now.

638
01:01:08,003 --> 01:01:09,300
<i>Jennifer!</i>

639
01:01:15,010 --> 01:01:16,568
Jennifer!

640
01:01:18,914 --> 01:01:20,779
<i>- Who is it?
- Jennifer!</i>

641
01:01:20,883 --> 01:01:23,317
It's that nosy bitch Joan.

642
01:01:24,553 --> 01:01:26,316
I'll take care of her.

643
01:01:26,455 --> 01:01:30,858
I wouldn't want you to violate
your delicate sensibilities.

644
01:01:35,764 --> 01:01:37,561
<i>Jennifer!</i>

645
01:01:56,585 --> 01:01:57,779
Jennifer?

646
01:02:04,293 --> 01:02:05,453
Jennifer!

647
01:02:41,063 --> 01:02:42,257
Jennifer?

648
01:02:52,074 --> 01:02:53,302
<i>Oh my God!</i>

649
01:03:01,150 --> 01:03:02,310
Jennifer.

650
01:03:04,153 --> 01:03:07,645
Look out behind you!
Joan!

651
01:03:27,810 --> 01:03:30,370
Look, I'm not gonna
give you crap.

652
01:03:31,780 --> 01:03:34,044
Nobody is perfect, Tiff.

653
01:03:34,917 --> 01:03:37,681
I've got a few
skeletons in the closet myself.

654
01:03:43,625 --> 01:03:46,526
See? Come on, Tiff?

655
01:03:46,662 --> 01:03:49,222
How long did it take
to build Rome anyway?

656
01:03:51,166 --> 01:03:52,394
Tiff?

657
01:03:56,772 --> 01:03:57,932
Glen?

658
01:03:58,307 --> 01:04:00,639
Guess again, daddy.

659
01:04:02,177 --> 01:04:05,146
- Glenda?
- That's my name.

660
01:04:05,314 --> 01:04:09,375
- Don't you ever hear?
- Oh shit!

661
01:04:13,121 --> 01:04:16,090
- What did I miss?
- Nothing much.

662
01:04:16,325 --> 01:04:18,555
I just fired Joan.

663
01:04:23,031 --> 01:04:25,556
Looks like you win after
all, Tiff.

664
01:04:25,801 --> 01:04:29,202
- Congratulations.
- You both win.

665
01:04:29,771 --> 01:04:34,401
I'm a real lady killer,
if you catch my drift.

666
01:04:34,543 --> 01:04:37,944
I'm a boned bonus baby.

667
01:04:40,382 --> 01:04:43,840
Jesus Christ Chucky,
what did you do to him?

668
01:04:44,019 --> 01:04:47,682
What did I do? At least I spent
time with the kid.

669
01:04:49,658 --> 01:04:51,523
Glen, wake up!

670
01:04:51,927 --> 01:04:55,488
Stop it, mommy.
You'll wrinkle my dress.

671
01:04:56,131 --> 01:04:59,294
How do you like it?
I made it myself.

672
01:04:59,835 --> 01:05:02,167
Like mother, like daughter,
right?

673
01:05:03,138 --> 01:05:07,871
Like mother, like daughter.
Like mother, like daughter.

674
01:05:09,978 --> 01:05:11,843
Wake up! Right now!

675
01:05:21,690 --> 01:05:24,090
Mom? Dad?

676
01:05:38,206 --> 01:05:39,673
What am I?

677
01:05:50,118 --> 01:05:52,450
Push, Mrs. Tilly.
Push!

678
01:05:52,654 --> 01:05:55,248
I'm pushing,
you little star fucker!

679
01:05:57,559 --> 01:06:00,824
Pay no attention to little
Mrs. Potty Mouth. She's hormone.

680
01:06:05,067 --> 01:06:08,195
Oh my God! It's coming!

681
01:06:08,370 --> 01:06:10,497
I can see it's little head.

682
01:06:18,413 --> 01:06:19,778
What is it? What is it?

683
01:06:22,017 --> 01:06:25,384
- It's a boy.
- A boy.

684
01:06:25,487 --> 01:06:27,045
Thank God.

685
01:06:27,255 --> 01:06:29,120
Give me my baby.

686
01:06:45,974 --> 01:06:49,273
Chucky, we're not done
here yet.

687
01:06:49,444 --> 01:06:51,878
- What?
- Jennifer isn't done.

688
01:06:52,147 --> 01:06:54,342
We've got another one here.

689
01:06:54,583 --> 01:06:57,108
Push, Jennifer. Push!

690
01:06:57,252 --> 01:06:59,777
Push! Push it out!

691
01:07:03,492 --> 01:07:04,925
What's this one?

692
01:07:08,196 --> 01:07:10,164
It's a girl.

693
01:07:23,111 --> 01:07:24,874
Chucky, it's time.

694
01:07:29,251 --> 01:07:32,345
- Give me the power, I beg of you.
- Hold it!

695
01:07:32,454 --> 01:07:34,854
Hold it. Chucky.
First he has to choose.

696
01:07:35,123 --> 01:07:37,353
I beg your pardon?

697
01:07:37,526 --> 01:07:39,892
Sorry, she has to choose.

698
01:07:40,662 --> 01:07:42,357
We don't have time for this shit.
- Wait Chucky!

699
01:07:43,098 --> 01:07:47,831
We have a son and a daughter.
Glen and Glenda.

700
01:07:48,203 --> 01:07:51,570
Don't you get it?
Maybe they don't have to choose.

701
01:07:54,409 --> 01:07:58,277
- Help!
- Hurry Chucky, do the chant!

702
01:07:58,380 --> 01:08:00,905
- Somebody help!
- Chucky, do it now!

703
01:08:01,049 --> 01:08:03,779
- Help! Help us!
- We won't get another chance.

704
01:08:08,356 --> 01:08:11,086
What are you waiting for,
Chucky?

705
01:08:12,761 --> 01:08:15,559
- Help!
- Do it! Do it!

706
01:08:15,664 --> 01:08:18,690
Everybody shut up!

707
01:08:19,501 --> 01:08:21,799
I've had it! That's it!

708
01:08:22,370 --> 01:08:24,964
There's a limit
to how much I can take.

709
01:08:25,373 --> 01:08:26,965
What are you talking about?

710
01:08:27,275 --> 01:08:30,176
Look around you, Tiff.
This is nuts!

711
01:08:30,479 --> 01:08:33,846
And I have a very high
tolerance for nuts.

712
01:08:33,982 --> 01:08:35,973
If this is what it takes
to be human...

713
01:08:36,318 --> 01:08:39,913
then I'd rather take my chances as
a supernaturally possessed doll...

714
01:08:40,021 --> 01:08:41,818
it's less complicated.

715
01:08:41,957 --> 01:08:45,358
- You can't be serious.
- As a heart attack.

716
01:08:45,694 --> 01:08:49,357
Think about it. What's so great
about being human anyway?

717
01:08:49,464 --> 01:08:54,367
You get sick, you get old,
you can't get it up anymore.

718
01:08:54,469 --> 01:08:56,334
I'm not looking forward
to that.

719
01:08:57,272 --> 01:09:00,935
Honey, I wanna be
Jennifer Tilly.

720
01:09:01,576 --> 01:09:03,840
I wanna be a star.

721
01:09:03,979 --> 01:09:06,311
And I don't wanna be
your chauffer.

722
01:09:06,615 --> 01:09:09,550
As a doll, I'm fucking infamous!

723
01:09:09,951 --> 01:09:13,443
I'm one of the most notorious
slashers in history.

724
01:09:13,555 --> 01:09:15,284
And I don't wanna give that up!

725
01:09:15,624 --> 01:09:18,650
I'm Chucky,
the Killer Doll!

726
01:09:18,994 --> 01:09:20,393
And I dig it!

727
01:09:24,266 --> 01:09:27,997
I have everything I want.
A beautiful wife.

728
01:09:30,605 --> 01:09:32,573
A multi-talented kid.

729
01:09:32,808 --> 01:09:35,470
This is who I am, Tiff.

730
01:09:35,744 --> 01:09:37,507
This is me!

731
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:42,182
Chucky, I don't know what the
fuck you're talking about...

732
01:09:42,617 --> 01:09:45,142
I don't know who the fuck
you are anymore.

733
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:48,221
But it's not enough for me.

734
01:09:48,957 --> 01:09:50,288
I want more.

735
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:52,951
What are you saying?

736
01:09:53,595 --> 01:09:54,926
It's over.

737
01:09:56,198 --> 01:09:58,098
We've gotta get out of here,
Sweet Face.

738
01:09:59,768 --> 01:10:02,259
I'm leaving you, Chucky,
and I'm taking the kid.

739
01:10:03,305 --> 01:10:07,571
Nobody leaves me!
Nobody!

740
01:10:09,110 --> 01:10:12,705
No! No!

741
01:10:16,852 --> 01:10:20,549
Jennifer, I love...

742
01:10:23,291 --> 01:10:26,055
Stan tell me, tell me...

743
01:10:48,016 --> 01:10:49,210
Jesus!

744
01:10:55,323 --> 01:10:58,781
- Oh my God!
- My babies!

745
01:11:10,038 --> 01:11:11,903
I just wanna know
where they are.

746
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:14,406
They're fine, Jennifer.
They're in the maternity ward.

747
01:11:14,509 --> 01:11:16,739
- Alright...
- The important thing for you...

748
01:11:16,912 --> 01:11:20,109
to think about now is getting well
so you can get on with your career.

749
01:11:20,215 --> 01:11:22,775
I don't care about my career,
I want my babies.

750
01:11:22,884 --> 01:11:25,352
I'm working on it Jennifer,
but you're not making it easy.

751
01:11:25,487 --> 01:11:27,921
I already talked to the cops,
they cleared me.

752
01:11:27,989 --> 01:11:29,479
They know that you're
not a killer...

753
01:11:29,557 --> 01:11:31,726
they didn't say you were
mentally competent.

754
01:11:31,726 --> 01:11:34,126
What do you expect
after the story you told?

755
01:11:34,829 --> 01:11:36,057
It's true.

756
01:11:37,065 --> 01:11:39,966
I suggest from now on you
keep that to yourself.

757
01:11:43,138 --> 01:11:44,696
We'll talk later.

758
01:11:48,877 --> 01:11:50,572
Try to get some sleep.

759
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:03,380
Wish me luck, Sweet Face.
Mommy is gonna be a star.

760
01:13:20,001 --> 01:13:23,732
I can't think of a thing to say.
Fuck it!

761
01:13:28,176 --> 01:13:30,906
Give me the power,
I beg of you.

762
01:13:40,722 --> 01:13:44,658
Switch! Switch! Switch!
Switch!

763
01:13:49,798 --> 01:13:53,325
Nobody leaves me! Nobody!

764
01:14:14,422 --> 01:14:16,083
What can I say?

765
01:14:17,792 --> 01:14:20,818
Honey...

766
01:14:21,863 --> 01:14:23,592
be a good girl...

767
01:14:24,265 --> 01:14:27,632
or boy, whatever.

768
01:14:29,938 --> 01:14:33,271
Don't make the same mistakes
your mom and dad made.

769
01:14:36,111 --> 01:14:38,272
Specially your dad.

770
01:15:26,227 --> 01:15:27,353
Let's go.

771
01:15:43,077 --> 01:15:45,068
- Glenda?
- No, dad.

772
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:47,748
It's me, your boy.

773
01:15:47,882 --> 01:15:50,350
Your chipper-filled block.

774
01:15:53,221 --> 01:15:56,679
Are you proud of me now, daddy?
Are you?

775
01:16:08,903 --> 01:16:12,999
Oughta boy, kid!
Oughta boy!

776
01:16:33,261 --> 01:16:37,721
Glen, there, there.

777
01:16:38,900 --> 01:16:43,030
It's alright. It's alright.

778
01:16:44,239 --> 01:16:46,002
You're gonna be alright.

779
01:16:48,109 --> 01:16:49,701
There, there.

780
01:16:51,946 --> 01:16:55,814
Honey, it's alright.

781
01:17:17,538 --> 01:17:22,373
Yesterday, she gave him a bloody
nose and took pictures for showing.

782
01:17:23,177 --> 01:17:27,477
And I'm pretty sure she's been
taking money from my purse.

783
01:17:27,715 --> 01:17:29,182
That's ridiculous.

784
01:17:29,284 --> 01:17:33,015
Glen is an angel, an absolute
dream. But Glenda...

785
01:17:34,289 --> 01:17:37,725
she's a bad girl, Mrs. Tilly.
A very bad girl.

786
01:17:38,159 --> 01:17:39,956
I'm not listening to this.

787
01:17:42,196 --> 01:17:45,563
- I hate that thing.
- Some of the kids wanna see her.

788
01:17:45,667 --> 01:17:47,100
- Mrs. Tilly...
- What?

789
01:17:47,235 --> 01:17:48,793
I'm afraid of her.

790
01:17:48,936 --> 01:17:51,734
Fulvia, it's only a doll.

791
01:17:54,042 --> 01:17:56,306
I was talking about Glenda.

792
01:17:58,446 --> 01:18:02,712
Fulvia, just exactly are you
trying to say?

793
01:18:03,985 --> 01:18:05,748
I can't work here anymore.

794
01:18:06,020 --> 01:18:08,215
- What?
- I'm sorry, I just can't.

795
01:18:08,356 --> 01:18:12,952
If you only saw the way she
looks at me with such... hate.

796
01:18:15,997 --> 01:18:19,455
Alright Fulvia,
if that's what you want.

797
01:18:20,535 --> 01:18:23,698
- We'll miss you.
- Thank you, Mrs. Tilly.

798
01:18:25,139 --> 01:18:26,538
God bless.

799
01:19:01,376 --> 01:19:05,574
<i>Mom got her wish.
She's a bright shining star.</i>

800
01:19:06,447 --> 01:19:08,540
<i>Now we're the perfect family.</i>

801
01:19:09,217 --> 01:19:11,378
<i>I've learned a lot about myself.</i>

802
01:19:11,619 --> 01:19:15,385
<i>I know I'm not alone.
I know I'm not a freak.</i>

803
01:19:15,890 --> 01:19:17,983
<i>And even though we had
our differences...</i>

804
01:19:18,326 --> 01:19:21,056
<i>I know my dad really
loved me.</i>

805
01:19:22,830 --> 01:19:25,458
Glen sweetheart,
come over here.

806
01:19:28,202 --> 01:19:30,432
Sweetheart look,
here's another one.

807
01:19:31,439 --> 01:19:33,964
- Who is it from, mommy?
- I don't know.

808
01:19:34,809 --> 01:19:36,071
Let's see.

809
01:19:36,911 --> 01:19:41,075
It doesn't say. Strange.
Doesn't say who it is.

810
01:19:41,382 --> 01:19:43,748
Sweetheart don't run so fast,
you can trip.

811
01:19:43,918 --> 01:19:45,010
So anyway...

812
01:23:03,517 --> 01:23:06,350
<i>he was on a movie,
he was gonna go after...</i>
