00:00:34,572 --> 00:00:38,192
Oh, my bar!
Why they do that?

2
00:00:46,191 --> 00:00:48,200
Get back!

3
00:00:52,648 --> 00:00:56,089
- You can't just leave 'em in this shit here. Come on.
- This boy's gone.

4
00:01:04,535 --> 00:01:06,934
Let's go. Come on.
Come on.

5
00:01:07,039 --> 00:01:09,228
Get back.

6
00:01:14,964 --> 00:01:19,030
<i>...fire is worse, and the fire is
lapping the outside of the building.</i>

7
00:01:31,022 --> 00:01:32,898
Hey, where's he going?

8
00:01:37,383 --> 00:01:40,616
What do you think you're doing? You know you're
forbidden to read anything not checked by this office.

9
00:01:40,651 --> 00:01:42,910
- What's there to check? I was there. It happened.
- Airman, you know the rules.

10
00:01:43,013 --> 00:01:45,726
If this is a legitimate news story,
it must go through proper channels.

11
00:01:45,829 --> 00:01:48,749
Listen, Tweedle-dee, it's an actual event.
Where do you think this came from, shaving?

12
00:01:48,784 --> 00:01:51,251
It's the truth. I just want to report
the truth. It'd be a nice change of pace.

13
00:01:51,356 --> 00:01:54,484
- What's goin' on here?
- Sir, will you listen to me?

14
00:01:58,552 --> 00:02:00,845
This is not official news, Airman. As
far as I'm concerned, it didn't happen.

15
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,896
- It did happen and I was-
- You shut your mouth.

16
00:02:02,931 --> 00:02:05,120
What are you afraid of, Dickerson? People
might find out there's a war goin' on?

17
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:07,102
This news
is not official, Airman.

18
00:02:07,207 --> 00:02:10,335
You want everyone going under the assumption it's
perfectly safe here, don't you? Well, it's not.

19
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,524
The fighting's not just in the hills. It's
downtown. It's a couple of fuckin' blocks-

20
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:15,757
I said it is none of
your goddam business!

21
00:02:18,468 --> 00:02:22,709
I see your point.
I'm sorry.

22
00:02:22,744 --> 00:02:26,288
I guess I get inside, hit these
air conditioners, I get a little dizzy.

23
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:32,650
Thanks for settin' me straight.
I'll be okay.

24
00:02:35,048 --> 00:02:38,176
<i>That about wraps it up for me,
Marty Lee, filling in for my buddy...</i>

25
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,826
<i>vacationing Eddie Kirk, who, despite all
your requests, will return tomorrow.</i>

26
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:45,267
<i>Right now, it's once again time
for the King Kong of Saigon...</i>

27
00:02:45,371 --> 00:02:47,248
<i>Adrian Cronauer.</i>

28
00:02:54,235 --> 00:02:59,866
Good morning, Vietnam!

29
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:02,159
<i>Hey, I know it's not the morning,
but that's my trademark...</i>

30
00:03:02,264 --> 00:03:04,610
<i>and "good evening"
sounds too depressing.</i>

31
00:03:04,645 --> 00:03:06,956
<i>Hey, we're goin'
right now to the news.</i>

32
00:03:09,876 --> 00:03:13,735
From England, today,
Princess Margaret threw a shoe!

33
00:03:13,838 --> 00:03:18,115
Easy, Madge. Also, uh, Elizab-
Queen Elizabeth, Liz- Elizabeth Taylor!

34
00:03:18,218 --> 00:03:21,347
Elizabeth Taylor.
She's still married after six months.

35
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:25,726
Way to go, Liz. Yea!

36
00:03:25,831 --> 00:03:29,272
All right! In Saigon today,
according to official sources...

37
00:03:29,307 --> 00:03:31,254
nothing actually happened.

38
00:03:31,357 --> 00:03:35,111
One thing that didn't officially happen was a
bomb didn't officially explode at 1430 hours...

39
00:03:35,146 --> 00:03:37,405
unofficially destroying
Jimmy Wah's Cafe.

40
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:41,264
- Get him out of there.
- Three men were unofficially wounded, and two men...

41
00:03:41,368 --> 00:03:44,705
<i>- whose identities are still not known at this time are unofficially dead.
- It's locked!</i>

42
00:03:44,809 --> 00:03:49,293
<i>- Well, break the goddam door down!
- Although the police, ambulance and fire department responded...</i>

43
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:52,108
what's believed to be unofficial
at this present moment.

44
00:03:52,213 --> 00:03:56,801
- Turn the power off in that studio.
- But his show is- - Turn it off! Now!

45
00:03:56,905 --> 00:04:00,659
I just wanted
to think that you should-

46
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,603
The man should be
court-martialed, sir.

47
00:04:45,707 --> 00:04:48,419
You think this is the most serious set
of affairs I have to address this week?

48
00:04:48,522 --> 00:04:50,921
- Well, it's not.
- I can't believe you're gonna pass on this, General.

49
00:04:51,025 --> 00:04:53,423
- The man is a goddamned subversive.
- He made a mistake, Dick.

50
00:04:53,528 --> 00:04:57,698
Mistake, sir? I don't want to be around when he
broadcasts US troop movements to the other side.

51
00:04:57,733 --> 00:05:00,931
I run the station according to strict
guidelines set by military intelligence.

52
00:05:01,036 --> 00:05:03,851
Military intelligence?
There's a contradiction in terms.

53
00:05:03,956 --> 00:05:05,937
Sir, the man is
a walking keg of dynamite.

54
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:10,316
In the eight weeks he's been on the air, General,
he's disobeyed orders as to style and content.

55
00:05:10,421 --> 00:05:13,757
He's read unofficial news.
What's he gonna be like in six months?

56
00:05:13,862 --> 00:05:16,676
What's he gonna be like when
he's ten times as popular, General?

57
00:05:16,781 --> 00:05:21,890
- How easy is it gonna be to get him off the air then?
- Who'll do the Cronauer show?

58
00:05:21,996 --> 00:05:25,541
Well, Hauk can do it, sir,
till I find a replacement.

59
00:05:27,209 --> 00:05:30,963
- Okay, for now, suspend him.
- Sir, you've made the correct choice.

60
00:05:31,067 --> 00:05:36,594
Right here, right here on our show,
Diana Ross and the "Suprawns. "

61
00:05:36,697 --> 00:05:39,304
<i>Set me free why don't you, babe</i>

62
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,911
<i>Set me free
why don't you, babe</i>

63
00:05:42,016 --> 00:05:46,396
<i>You don't really need me
You just keep me steamin'on</i>

64
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:50,045
Thank you very much. Let me introduce
the members of the band. Larry, Pisces.

65
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:52,653
Thank you very much.

66
00:05:52,756 --> 00:05:55,885
- What'd he say?
- He say you drink too much already.

67
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,700
Well, tell him I drink
so I can be this funny.

68
00:06:02,872 --> 00:06:04,853
It's not funny at all,
he said.

69
00:06:04,957 --> 00:06:07,460
Tell him thanks. It's nice
to bomb in another language.

70
00:06:07,565 --> 00:06:11,214
You will get sick
if you drink some more. Come on.

71
00:06:13,299 --> 00:06:16,740
My village not too far from here.
You could come there for resting.

72
00:06:16,775 --> 00:06:18,721
You could see
how we live.

73
00:06:18,825 --> 00:06:23,413
<i>Listen, Sparky, I don't think seeing your little
production of Our Town is gonna cheer me up.</i>

74
00:06:23,518 --> 00:06:26,855
- You see Trinh there.
- I'll drive.

75
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:29,148
Red leather, yellow leather.
Red- Led-

76
00:06:29,254 --> 00:06:32,695
<i>- Red- Red leather, yellow leather.
Red leather, yellow leather- - Sir, sir.</i>

77
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,136
<i>Reading the news is one thing, but this stuff you wrote, i
- it's not funny, sir. It's sad.</i>

78
00:06:36,241 --> 00:06:40,203
<i>Sir? I'm begging you. Don't try to
do comedy. It's not in your blood.</i>

79
00:06:40,307 --> 00:06:42,288
<i>I'll do fine.
Comedy is what you make it.</i>

80
00:06:42,392 --> 00:06:45,937
<i>I've got pages and pages
of great material. Right, Abersold?</i>

81
00:06:46,043 --> 00:06:49,066
<i>I'm afraid you're gonna
be hittin'bottom, sir.</i>

82
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:52,194
If it isn't funny, then why did I
hear you laughing when you typed it?

83
00:06:52,299 --> 00:06:54,384
<i>I was thinking
of something else.</i>

84
00:06:54,489 --> 00:06:58,243
Thank you for your support.
Now I've got a show to do.

85
00:06:58,347 --> 00:07:00,710
<i>Sir, you're not funny.
Ask around.</i>

86
00:07:00,745 --> 00:07:03,422
<i>Ask me. Sir,
with all due respect...</i>

87
00:07:03,457 --> 00:07:05,750
<i>uh, uh, I think you're gonna-
you might lay an egg- I mean a big egg.</i>

88
00:07:05,855 --> 00:07:09,087
<i>I mean, I know funny, and I don't think
you're it. But hey, such is life.</i>

89
00:07:09,122 --> 00:07:12,841
<i>Me, I'm not much
with power tools.</i>

90
00:07:12,946 --> 00:07:15,448
<i>Hey, that was the great,
exciting sound of Petula Clark.</i>

91
00:07:15,553 --> 00:07:18,785
<i>- Beach Boys. Those were guys.
- Of the Beach Boys.</i>

92
00:07:18,889 --> 00:07:21,079
<i>Hey, that wraps it up for me,
Marty Lee Dreiwitz.</i>

93
00:07:21,114 --> 00:07:23,495
<i>Adrian Cronauer is on
temporary assignment...</i>

94
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:25,876
<i>but boy, do I have
a surprise for you.</i>

95
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:29,108
<i>- Don't build him up. You'll only let 'em down.
- Please welcome to the microphone...</i>

96
00:07:29,212 --> 00:07:34,114
<i>the lieutenant of laughs, the officer
of oral, the Westmoreland of wit...</i>

97

<i>swingin'Steven Hauk!</i>

98
00:07:38,597 --> 00:07:41,622
<i>Hello, Vietnam.
And greetings.</i>

99
00:07:41,726 --> 00:07:44,750
<i>Soon, the news.
Then-</i>

100
00:07:44,854 --> 00:07:47,982
<i>"Lieutenant Steve!
Lieutenant Steve!"</i>

101
00:07:48,086 --> 00:07:51,319
<i>Who's that?
"It's me, your old pal Frenchy. "</i>

102
00:07:51,424 --> 00:07:54,760
Listen, Frenchy, let me ask you
something. Do you like good food?

103
00:07:54,865 --> 00:07:58,201
"Oh, but of course.
Uh, the French love good food. "

104
00:07:58,306 --> 00:08:03,102
Well, then, I guess that would
make you an "Eatie Gourmet. "

105
00:08:03,207 --> 00:08:06,126
"Oh, ho, ho, ho, Lieutenant Steve. "

106
00:08:06,231 --> 00:08:10,298
- Oh, Frenchy.
- "Oh, ho, ho, Lieutenant Steve. "

107
00:08:11,862 --> 00:08:14,886
Frenchy. You know,
I really shouldn't kid Frenchy...

108
00:08:14,989 --> 00:08:18,327
because sometimes he
"Stan Getz" mad at me...

109
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:20,934
and he could "Al Hirt" me.

110
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:23,854
"Uh, Lieutenant Steve,
let's play some music. "

111
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:26,460
Okay, Frenchy.
What would you like to hear?

112
00:08:26,564 --> 00:08:30,214
"Well, uh, I love a good polka
as much as the next man. "

113
00:08:30,249 --> 00:08:34,178
Well, a good polka it is
for my good friend Frenchy.

114
00:08:42,623 --> 00:08:45,125
I think some apologies
are in order.

115
00:08:55,345 --> 00:08:58,786
You're not gonna continue
this broadcast, are you, sir?

116
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:42,583
- What are they doing?
- Oh, they're Buddhists.

117
00:09:42,688 --> 00:09:46,441
They're sitting
for peace, wisdom and knowledge.

118
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:49,047
They're waiting
for enlightenment.

119
00:10:05,628 --> 00:10:08,860
This man lose one son
from blasting American mine.

120
00:10:10,842 --> 00:10:14,283
His father and brother
was killed by French long ago.

121
00:10:14,386 --> 00:10:16,786
I think it's not fair to him.

122
00:11:15,598 --> 00:11:17,892
Look.

123
00:11:17,995 --> 00:11:20,186
He's going,
"No big deal. " Look.

124
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:23,836
<i>How lovin'can you feel
when you got that moment when</i>

125
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:27,381
<i>Don't you know that the time can be
thataway, wacka-wack wacka-wack, wacka-wack</i>

126
00:11:27,485 --> 00:11:30,926
<i>And don't you know that it ain't gonna
be and you feel that the time you see</i>

127
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:34,367
<i>And it all wacka-wack wacka-wacka,
wacka-wacka I know and I'm movin'</i>

128
00:11:34,472 --> 00:11:36,870
Look. Up there. Pull.

129
00:11:36,974 --> 00:11:39,373
Pull.

130
00:11:58,246 --> 00:12:01,896
You not understand.
You not.

131
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,233
We no future together, "Cronow. "

132
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:09,509
My country, maybe no future.

133
00:12:13,158 --> 00:12:15,417
Hey, I like you. I just want
to be your friend, okay?

134
00:12:15,452 --> 00:12:18,998
- I know it sounds dumb.
- I- I not can do this, "Cronow. "

135
00:12:20,561 --> 00:12:23,273
No. No friend, "Cronow. "

136
00:12:24,941 --> 00:12:27,131
Not good for, for me.

137
00:12:27,235 --> 00:12:30,259
My brother,
okay, friends.

138
00:12:30,363 --> 00:12:34,118
But Vietnam ladies not friends.

139
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,706
Please. Okay?

140
00:12:39,853 --> 00:12:41,834
Not friends.

141
00:12:52,262 --> 00:12:54,869
Great week.

142
00:13:37,622 --> 00:13:40,438
That's about as good a polka
as you'll ever hear.

143
00:13:44,922 --> 00:13:47,424
You want Cronauer
back on the air.

144
00:13:49,509 --> 00:13:53,369
We've gotten duffel bags filled with
information asking for Cronauer's reinstatement.

145
00:13:53,472 --> 00:13:56,705
The men all hate Hauk.
They want Cronauer back.

146
00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:00,564
He's an exhilarating personality,
and polkas are just no substitute.

147
00:14:00,667 --> 00:14:04,316
- I think I see a pattern forming here.
- Sir, these letters are unequivocal.

148
00:14:04,351 --> 00:14:07,549
Uh, e. g. "Hey, Hauk, eat a bag
of shit. You suck. "

149
00:14:07,654 --> 00:14:10,574
That's pretty much to the point, sir.
Not much grey area in this one.

150
00:14:10,678 --> 00:14:15,058
We got one positive call from some guy in Wichita who
thought Hauk's comedy was visionary and interesting.

151
00:14:15,163 --> 00:14:19,750
The other 1,100 calls said that the man
can't do comedy to save his dick.

152
00:14:19,854 --> 00:14:24,234
- That's a direct quote, sir.
- I've taken 90 calls this morning. They just don't like Hauk.

153
00:14:24,339 --> 00:14:29,656
From a marine in Da Nang: "Captain Hauk
sucks the sweat off a dead man's balls. "

154
00:14:29,761 --> 00:14:33,724
I have no idea what that means, sir,
but it seems very negative to me.

155
00:14:33,828 --> 00:14:36,330
I think the troops are tryin'
to tell us somethin', fellas.

156
00:14:37,581 --> 00:14:40,779
Sir, if it is my programming
choices, I can change.

157
00:14:40,814 --> 00:14:44,255
I've been broadcasting the polkas because
I thought a certain segment of the men...

158
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,801
weren't represented by Cronauer's
broadcasts of rock and roll.

159
00:14:47,904 --> 00:14:50,789
But I can easily play
an occasional Gary Lewis record.

160
00:14:50,824 --> 00:14:55,309
It doesn't make a damn whether you play
polkas or don't play polkas. Military politics.

161
00:14:55,413 --> 00:14:58,019
Nothing personal. The men just
like him better than they do you.

162
00:14:58,124 --> 00:15:02,087
He maliciously and with purposeful
intent read unofficial news.

163
00:15:02,191 --> 00:15:04,589
No, no, no, no.
He made a mistake.

164
00:15:04,693 --> 00:15:09,803
We all make mistakes. Now this thing
is a delicate balance over here...

165
00:15:09,907 --> 00:15:12,410
and I don't want it
dependent on a disc jockey.

166
00:15:12,515 --> 00:15:14,496
The men want him back,
I want him back.

167
00:15:14,599 --> 00:15:20,230
Sir, you heard from the men who don't like my
humour, but what about the silent masses who do?

168
00:15:20,334 --> 00:15:24,402
And as far as polkas, they are
a much-maligned musical taste.

169
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:29,616
Lieutenant, you don't know whether you're shot, fucked,
powder-burned or snake-bit. I don't care about polkas.

170
00:15:29,651 --> 00:15:33,682
They're rioting in Hue. We're bringin'
in thousands of troops every month.

171
00:15:33,787 --> 00:15:36,046
Terrorism's on the uprise
in Saigon.

172
00:15:36,081 --> 00:15:39,210
The problems of this country have not
one goddamned thing to do with...

173
00:15:39,245 --> 00:15:41,607
whether you play polkas
or don't play polkas.

174
00:15:41,712 --> 00:15:44,840
The men want him back.
I want him back.

175
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:46,926
Reinstate the man.

176
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:50,262
Sir, in my heart...

177
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:52,451
I know I'm funny.

178
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:55,789
Thank you, Lieutenant.

179
00:16:04,757 --> 00:16:07,781
- There you are, sir.
- Please don't call me "sir. "

180
00:16:07,886 --> 00:16:10,388
It just came down the pike.
You're back on the air, sir.

181
00:16:10,492 --> 00:16:14,245
- I'm not goin' on.
- What do you mean you're not goin' on?

182
00:16:14,351 --> 00:16:18,833
If you don't understand what I said, maybe you
should take my English class. I'm not goin' on.

183
00:16:18,868 --> 00:16:21,754
You're a very attractive man, Abersold.
Don't think I haven't noticed.

184
00:16:24,047 --> 00:16:27,488
- You'll be bored, you know. What are you gonna do with your time?
- I don't know.

185
00:16:27,593 --> 00:16:31,451
I may go downtown, look
for a Vietnamese man named Phil.

186
00:16:31,556 --> 00:16:34,475
Or I may just stay here
and listen to old Pat Boone records.

187
00:16:34,581 --> 00:16:39,690
Try and find some hidden meaning 'cause basically
I believe that that man is a misunderstood genius.

188
00:16:40,732 --> 00:16:43,757
Genius. What are you
saying to me?

189
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:47,614
I'm sayin' I'm through, Ed. I'm tired
of people tellin' me what I can't say.

190
00:16:47,719 --> 00:16:50,951
This news isn't official.
That comment is too sarcastic.

191
00:16:51,055 --> 00:16:55,227
I can't even make fun of Richard Nixon, and
there's a man who's screaming out to be made fun of.

192
00:16:55,331 --> 00:16:58,356
So fuck it. Sorry.

193
00:17:00,127 --> 00:17:02,526
- Is he all right?
- No, Phil, he's not all right.

194
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:06,801
A man does not refer to Pat Boone as a
beautiful genius if things are all right.

195
00:17:11,181 --> 00:17:14,309
- Sir.
- Garlick?

196
00:17:14,414 --> 00:17:18,168
I'd like you to collate these
one-minute spots prior to broadcast.

197
00:17:18,272 --> 00:17:21,818
You have a problem
with that, young man?

198
00:17:21,921 --> 00:17:25,154
Absolutely not.
I live to collate, sir.

199
00:17:25,259 --> 00:17:29,429
Good. So do I.

200
00:17:32,245 --> 00:17:36,798
- "Get AJob. "
- Get a job. Again.

201
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:40,691
- Get a job. Right. You got it. You're cookin' now.
- Sir?

202
00:17:40,796 --> 00:17:44,237
- Edward.
- I'd like an explanation.

203
00:17:44,341 --> 00:17:48,407
- On anything in particular?
- A lot of people went to the mat for you.

204
00:17:48,513 --> 00:17:53,727
Thousands of guys wrote in, called in,
tryin' to get you reinstated.

205
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:58,627
And I literally think that you owe it to
all of them to get your ass back on the air.

206
00:17:58,731 --> 00:18:01,546
If you haven't noticed,
the army doesn't really want me, Ed.

207
00:18:01,651 --> 00:18:03,945
They've been harassing me since
the day I got off the plane.

208
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:09,680
So what? It's the guys in the field that matter,
remember? Those are the guys that are dyin'.

209
00:18:09,785 --> 00:18:13,226
Edward, I tried to tell the truth,
and they kicked me off the air.

210
00:18:13,329 --> 00:18:16,875
I screw up once more, Dickerson sends me into
the field with a rifle. I come home in a box.

211
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:19,378
What you do is important
to a lot of people.

212
00:18:19,413 --> 00:18:22,471
Forget it, will ya?
Listen. I give up.

213
00:18:22,506 --> 00:18:26,365
I'm gonna phone 'em in, okay? Enough
bullshit. I'm outta here. See you, fellas.

214
00:18:26,468 --> 00:18:28,972
- Buy you some lunch.
- Can't let you do that.

215
00:18:29,076 --> 00:18:32,726
Listen, if I don't get to my class, there's gonna be a
bunch of Vietnamese speaking in short, choppy sentences.

216
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:36,167
- Look, we gotta talk. We gotta talk now.
- Not now, man. Come on.

217
00:18:36,271 --> 00:18:40,198
I can't believe you!
What? That's it?

218
00:18:40,233 --> 00:18:43,153
You're gonna leave the whole fuckin' thing behind.
You're gonna leave everything fuckin' hanging.

219
00:18:43,257 --> 00:18:47,429
- People are depending on you!
- Edward, please.

220
00:18:47,533 --> 00:18:49,931
That's two nasty words
in one year.

221
00:18:50,035 --> 00:18:52,712
- Forgive me.
- Hey.

222
00:18:52,747 --> 00:18:56,084
Hey, you wanna give me a ride to school
or am I gonna have to buy another bike?

223
00:18:56,188 --> 00:18:58,274
You're pissin' me off.

224
00:19:09,222 --> 00:19:12,142
- What the hell's the hold-up?
- Check it out.

225
00:19:17,251 --> 00:19:21,736
Garlick, will you cut it out? You're beginning
to sound like a priest in a '40s movie.

226
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:24,656
We are not firing you
when the boys are dependin' on you.

227
00:19:32,789 --> 00:19:35,916
- Gentlemen?
- What are you doing, Ed?

228
00:19:36,021 --> 00:19:38,732
Hey, guys. Guess who the hell
I got in here.

229
00:19:38,837 --> 00:19:41,339
- Uh-oh. Don't do this shit.
- Groucho Marx!

230
00:19:41,444 --> 00:19:43,425
- Senator Dirksen.
- Hey, Curly!

231
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:46,971
- Moe. - Come on, come on, come on. Guess
again. - Oh, bag it. Bag it, Garlick.

232
00:19:47,006 --> 00:19:52,601
The fellow I got in here is
the gentleman, the one and the only...

233
00:19:52,706 --> 00:19:56,773
- You're a dead man.
- king of the airwaves, Adrian Cronauer.

234
00:19:56,877 --> 00:19:59,901
Hey, Peterson, get up here, man.
I think we got Cronauer here.

235
00:20:00,005 --> 00:20:04,176
Hey, Cronauer, say
"Good morning, Vietnam. "

236
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,992
Oh, give me a break, man.
It's too hot for radio shit, okay?

237
00:20:07,027 --> 00:20:09,077
- Come on.
- Come on!

238
00:20:09,181 --> 00:20:12,518
- How do we know it's Adrian Cronauer?
- Okay.

239
00:20:12,622 --> 00:20:14,708
I'll give her the best shot.

240
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:19,088
Good morning, Vietnam!

241
00:20:22,112 --> 00:20:24,510
All right! All right!

242
00:20:26,596 --> 00:20:30,038
We love you, Cron!

243
00:20:30,141 --> 00:20:32,956
All right, this is Adrian Cronauer.
I'm on at 6:00 and again at 4:00.

244
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,772
Hey, we'd like to welcome you to Vietnam,
the country that is more stimulating...

245
00:20:35,876 --> 00:20:38,657
than a strong cup of cappuccino
or an espresso enema.

246
00:20:38,692 --> 00:20:43,175
That one's comin' right at you right now, but first, our
fashion report from Special Forces Sergeant Ernest Lee Sincere.

247
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:47,451
"Thank you. I think this fall, the discerning
GI is gonna be wearing green in the jungle.

248
00:20:47,555 --> 00:20:49,953
Why? Because it matches
with the green. I don't know.

249
00:20:50,059 --> 00:20:53,500
The leaves, they fall upon the helmets,
says yes to me. " Thank you.

250
00:20:53,535 --> 00:20:56,592
Here's a little news flash
comin' your way right now.

251
00:20:56,627 --> 00:21:01,215
We can't afford the teletype. Here it is,
comin' for you right now. Quick news flash.

252
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,718
Former President Eisenhower,
actually cartoon character Elmer Fudd.

253
00:21:03,753 --> 00:21:06,220
He was quoted as saying:
"Thank you, America.

254
00:21:06,325 --> 00:21:08,514
It was fun being Pwesident. "

255
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:11,539
Also, Gina Lollobrigida has been declared
the Italian National Mountain Range.

256
00:21:11,643 --> 00:21:14,527
Thank you, Gina. "Look out.
Look, I don't see the sun any more. "

257
00:21:14,562 --> 00:21:19,151
Let's play a little game show while we're waiting.
And who can tell me who sang the song "My Guy"?

258
00:21:19,256 --> 00:21:21,236
- Hi. Where you from?
- Uh, Boston.

259
00:21:21,341 --> 00:21:24,782
- Boston, you know who sang the song "My Guy"?
- Yeah, shit, I can't think of it.

260
00:21:24,817 --> 00:21:28,223
Thank you for playing! "Yeah, shit,
I can't think of it. " That's right.

261
00:21:28,327 --> 00:21:32,394
You don't win the case of fish balls and
lizard testicles. Thank you for playing anyway.

262
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:35,940
- Here it is right now. Hey, what's
your name? - Patrick O'Ma- O'Malley.

263
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:41,258
Patrick O-O-O-O'Malley. I don't know.
I'm just so happy. I'm O-O-O'Malley.

264
00:21:41,362 --> 00:21:44,178
Oh, he's good.
I don't know. It's the Irish boy.

265
00:21:44,282 --> 00:21:47,479
I'm just so full of semen.
I haven't gotten laid yet.

266
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:50,852
I'm sittin' out there, and I'm the Catholic
boy and I don't know when I'll be gettin' laid.

267
00:21:50,955 --> 00:21:54,501
- I'm just goin' off to Vietnam. Where you from?
- From the Village. New York.

268
00:21:54,536 --> 00:21:58,047
From the Village? Well, nice to have you
here. Nice to have you here in Vietnam.

269
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:01,696
Obviously, you just said, "Well, fuck it. I'll
join the army and be with people in green. "

270
00:22:01,731 --> 00:22:04,303
- It's a special thing to do. Hey, what's your name?
- Jimmy Wilkes.

271
00:22:04,408 --> 00:22:06,702
- Jimmy Wilkes. Where you from,Jimmy?
- I'm also New York.

272
00:22:06,737 --> 00:22:08,683
Ohh! Two boys
joined together.

273
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:11,394
Hey, said, "Well, I got drunk, man.
All of a sudden, I went for a tattoo.

274
00:22:11,498 --> 00:22:13,896
Next thing you know, I'm on
a fuckin' truck. What happened?"

275
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,816
It's wild, baby. I don't know what's
goin' down. But you're both from New York.

276
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,006
Nice to have you here.
Like, you just, like hangin' out?

277
00:22:19,109 --> 00:22:21,404
- You're headed north. Where you goin' to?
- Nha Trengh.

278
00:22:21,509 --> 00:22:23,490
Well, you gotta be careful,Jack.
That's some heavy stuff up there.

279
00:22:23,594 --> 00:22:26,202
That's like Newark after dark.
You gotta watch out.

280
00:22:26,305 --> 00:22:28,564
There's some heavy shit
goin' down, baby.

281
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:31,623
You'll feel like George Wallace campaigning
in Harlem. "Hi, have you seen my face?"

282
00:22:31,658 --> 00:22:34,613
"Get yo' ass outta here!" You gotta
watch it. What type of music do you like?

283
00:22:34,648 --> 00:22:37,254
- You like, uh- You like Little Anthony?
You like Little Anthony? - Yeah! Stones.

284
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:40,070
- I like James Brown better.
- You like James Brown better. Yes, sir.

285
00:22:40,174 --> 00:22:42,468
And the Stones. Oh, you like
Mick Jagger? Mick Jagger, right.

286
00:22:42,572 --> 00:22:45,909
Do you think he looks like a photo
negative of Little Richard or am I crazy?

287
00:22:46,013 --> 00:22:48,933
Really. And that hair. I think-
I don't know. All right!

288
00:22:49,037 --> 00:22:51,297
Gentlemen, I don't know-
Oh, my God, these lips!

289
00:22:51,332 --> 00:22:54,147
My God, they're moving!
I'm gonna flap my eyebrows to death.

290
00:22:54,251 --> 00:22:57,796
Look out. I'm singing, everybody.
I'm singing. Oh, get outta here.

291
00:22:57,902 --> 00:23:01,760
- Watch out. All right. Where are you from? Where you from?
- I'm from, uh, Cleveland, man.

292
00:23:01,795 --> 00:23:04,470
- Cleveland. - Yeah. - Obviously, Vietnam's
not that much of a change for you, then.

293
00:23:04,576 --> 00:23:07,286
Aw, nah.

294
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:12,604
You guys take care of yourself, 'cause you all look
like: I don't know what's gonna happen, man. I don't know.

295
00:23:12,708 --> 00:23:15,836
- What's this thing on the side of your helmet? What is that thing you're wearing? What do you got there?
- Here. Why don't you try it out?

296
00:23:15,941 --> 00:23:19,486
Well, "Why don't you try it out?" Look at this. Look
at that. It says here, it says what sizes you got.

297
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:22,371
You got large, medium
and Caucasian.

298
00:23:22,406 --> 00:23:27,098
Look at this thing. A little Italian party
favour there. Oh! "Oh, no, Bozo, boys and girls. "

299
00:23:27,203 --> 00:23:29,497
Look at this thing. Obviously, this
is goin' like, "Yeah, check it out. "

300
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,521
Hold on. Look. How big is this thing?
Hold on. How big is this?

301
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:36,171
Black man's goin', "It's just for
the tip. That's all I need is the tip. "

302
00:23:36,274 --> 00:23:39,090
It's a bathing cap.
I just like to put a bathing cap.

303
00:23:39,195 --> 00:23:43,575
Remember, this is the Vietnamese word
"Con Dum. " Look. Italian moon launch.

304
00:23:43,678 --> 00:23:47,224
There. Whoa, jeez.
It almost blew up in my face.

305
00:23:47,329 --> 00:23:50,248
There's prophylactic everywhere, man.
It's not a pretty picture.

306
00:23:50,352 --> 00:23:52,542
There's pieces of rubber
all over his face.

307
00:23:52,646 --> 00:23:55,566
I don't know what to say.
You guys, be careful. What's your name?

308
00:23:55,671 --> 00:23:58,799
- My name is Lewis Striker.
- Lewis Striker, Brother Striker. Thank you, Brother Striker.

309
00:23:58,903 --> 00:24:00,988
- Sean Donum. - Sean
Donum. - Jay Snyder.

310
00:24:01,093 --> 00:24:04,325
Feels like the Mouseketeers show.
Annette, Cubby, Roy!

311
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:08,391
Well, you guys, you take care
of yourselves. I won't forget you.

312
00:24:08,497 --> 00:24:12,980
All right, guys, let's say goodbye
to the radio star. We're outta here.

313
00:24:16,838 --> 00:24:20,280
Bye-bye-bye-bye!

314
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:40,300
All right!

315
00:25:34,212 --> 00:25:38,383
<i>Good morning, Vietnam!</i>

316
00:25:38,487 --> 00:25:41,928
<i>Hey, it's another delightful day
here in Vacationland.</i>

317
00:25:42,033 --> 00:25:44,170
<i>Everybody, time to get up.</i>

318
00:25:44,205 --> 00:25:46,308
<i>Get up, wherever you are.</i>

319
00:25:46,412 --> 00:25:50,270
<i>That's right, rise and shine,
rise and shine!</i>

320
00:25:50,375 --> 00:25:53,816
Got some songs goin' out right now to a
couple of guys on the road to Nha Trengh.

321
00:25:53,851 --> 00:25:56,944
You know what I'm talkin' about.
Hey, Mr O'Malley, O'Malley.

322
00:25:56,979 --> 00:25:59,134
You know.
The Irish Dolby twins.

323
00:25:59,238 --> 00:26:02,888
They're out there. Special song
goin' out to you, right now.

324
00:26:07,476 --> 00:26:10,604
<i>I see trees of green</i>

325
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:15,297
<i>Red roses too</i>

326
00:26:15,401 --> 00:26:18,738
<i>I see them bloom</i>

327
00:26:18,842 --> 00:26:21,136
<i>For me and you</i>

328
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,473
<i>And I think to myself</i>

329
00:26:26,141 --> 00:26:29,478
<i>What a wonderful world</i>

330
00:26:34,066 --> 00:26:37,299
<i>I see skies of blue</i>

331
00:26:38,551 --> 00:26:41,540
<i>And clouds of white</i>

332
00:26:41,575 --> 00:26:45,224
<i>The bright, blessed day</i>

333
00:26:45,329 --> 00:26:48,300
<i>The dark, sacred night</i>

334
00:26:48,335 --> 00:26:51,272
<i>And I think to myself</i>

335
00:26:52,836 --> 00:26:55,965
<i>What a wonderful world</i>

336
00:27:01,282 --> 00:27:04,412
<i>The colours of the rainbow</i>

337
00:27:04,515 --> 00:27:07,853
<i>So pretty in the sky</i>

338
00:27:07,956 --> 00:27:10,824
<i>Are also on the faces</i>

339
00:27:10,859 --> 00:27:13,692
<i>Of people going by</i>

340
00:27:13,797 --> 00:27:17,863
<i>I see friends shakin'hands</i>

341
00:27:17,898 --> 00:27:21,930
<i>Sayin'
How do you do</i>

342
00:27:22,034 --> 00:27:27,456
<i>They're really saying
I love you</i>

343
00:27:27,491 --> 00:27:31,227
<i>I hear babies crying</i>

344
00:27:31,262 --> 00:27:34,964
<i>I watch them grow</i>

345
00:27:35,069 --> 00:27:38,092
<i>They'll learn much more</i>

346
00:27:38,197 --> 00:27:41,221
<i>Than I'll ever know</i>

347
00:27:41,325 --> 00:27:44,246
<i>And I think to myself</i>

348
00:27:46,435 --> 00:27:48,834
<i>What a wonderful world</i>

349
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:57,488
<i>Yes, I think to myself</i>

350
00:28:00,199 --> 00:28:03,745
<i>What a wonderful world</i>

351
00:28:10,001 --> 00:28:13,442
<i>- Oh, yeah
- Oh, yeah</i>

352
00:28:15,423 --> 00:28:18,760
That was Louis B. Armstrong,
the great Satchmo.

353
00:28:22,515 --> 00:28:27,521
Want to interview some Gls in the field,
sir? And play those tapes on the radio?

354
00:28:27,556 --> 00:28:29,501
God only knows
what they'd say, sir.

355
00:28:29,605 --> 00:28:32,943
It involves Cronauer, which
makes me suspicious immediately.

356
00:28:33,046 --> 00:28:38,052
An Lac. And Cronauer would definitely
be going along? Hold on a minute, sir.

357
00:28:43,058 --> 00:28:45,455
G-2, Corporal Tiser, sir.

358
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:48,896
One moment.

359
00:28:53,381 --> 00:28:57,969
- Route One-A, sir, is the only route to An
Lac, sir. - Does that road have a secure status?

360
00:28:58,004 --> 00:29:01,306
No, sir, it does not.
That road is Victor Charlie, sir.

361
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:05,163
- It is definitely not a friendly area.
- Negative, sir. It is not.

362
00:29:05,268 --> 00:29:08,814
It is hazardous and, uh,
has been for about 48 hours.

363
00:29:08,917 --> 00:29:12,150
Heavily fortified and considered
very unsafe, sir.

364
00:29:12,255 --> 00:29:14,549
Thank you.

365
00:29:17,364 --> 00:29:21,640
Sir, I recommend we issue
a 24-hour pass.

366
00:29:38,637 --> 00:29:41,973
So this is the country where
they grow rattan love seats.

367
00:29:42,078 --> 00:29:45,206
God, is it hot.
What a country.

368
00:29:45,311 --> 00:29:50,108
Heat, humidity, terrorism. Still,
it's better than New York in the summer.

369
00:29:50,143 --> 00:29:53,131
Hey, fellas,
how's the cough drop business?

370
00:30:01,578 --> 00:30:04,705
You know, we haven't passed
too many checkpoints since Chon Thanh.

371
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:08,356
Why do you make every Vietnamese town
sound like a Mexican restaurant?

372
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:10,927
Britain imposed an oil embargo
on Rhodesia today...

373
00:30:10,962 --> 00:30:13,987
after that country's unilateral
declaration of independence.

374
00:30:14,091 --> 00:30:18,784
Gambia, Singapore and the Maldive
Islands join the United Nations.

375
00:30:18,887 --> 00:30:21,598
Sertse Khama becomes
the first premier of Bechuanaland.

376
00:30:21,704 --> 00:30:24,622
<i>In sports, all-star rookie
Pete Rose's three hits-</i>

377
00:30:24,726 --> 00:30:27,647
What do you think you'll do after all
this, Ed? When you get out of the army?

378
00:30:27,682 --> 00:30:29,628
I think I learned enough
about radio stations-

379
00:30:29,732 --> 00:30:32,443
I mean, maybe I can work
in a station back home or something.

380
00:30:32,548 --> 00:30:34,737
Really? Give me your best shot.
Lay somethin' on me.

381
00:30:34,842 --> 00:30:36,928
Give it a go.
Give it a go.

382
00:30:37,032 --> 00:30:40,265
This is Eddie Garlick comin' to you live
from AFRS, Armed Forces Radio Saigon.

383
00:30:40,369 --> 00:30:45,165
Now funkify it. Give me some real funk.
Give it to me, Edward.

384
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,460
This is Eddie Garlick, com-

385
00:30:47,563 --> 00:30:50,692
Good morning, Vietnam!

386
00:31:01,537 --> 00:31:06,541
You're listening to Eddie Kirk
on AFRS. I have a big special-

387
00:31:31,255 --> 00:31:33,445
<i>...for, but we need
to hear your requests.</i>

388
00:31:33,549 --> 00:31:36,574
<i>So send in your postcards
to Eddie Kirk, right here.</i>

389
00:31:38,242 --> 00:31:40,119
Hey!

390
00:31:44,603 --> 00:31:49,192
You fine. How you are?
Take you home.

391
00:31:50,964 --> 00:31:53,675
You come out.
No problem.

392
00:31:53,779 --> 00:31:57,742
Take you home.
Safe now from VC.

393
00:32:11,298 --> 00:32:14,217
Hi. This is Marty Lee Dreiwitz
at Cronauer Control Centre.

394
00:32:14,252 --> 00:32:16,721
Adrian Cronauer is on
temporary assignment...

395
00:32:16,824 --> 00:32:20,230
and I'll be filling in until he arrives,
hopefully sometime this morning.

396
00:32:20,265 --> 00:32:24,124
Right now, let's play a song from Adrian's
own playlist, one of AC's favourites.

397
00:32:34,761 --> 00:32:39,870
It's going to be an exciting day of
listening and learning, so please, tune in.

398
00:32:41,538 --> 00:32:45,709
"Sukiyaki," "Volare,"
"The Portuguese Washerwoman"...

399
00:32:45,813 --> 00:32:51,549
<i>- and "Third Man Theme" on the Kirk
International- - Baby, please don't go</i>

400
00:32:51,653 --> 00:32:54,572
<i>Baby, please don't go</i>

401
00:32:54,676 --> 00:32:56,936
<i>Baby, please don't go
down to New Orleans</i>

402
00:32:56,971 --> 00:32:59,996
<i>You know I love you so
Baby, please don't go</i>

403
00:33:02,706 --> 00:33:06,565
<i>- Baby, I'm done gone Baby, I'm done gone
- Hold it, hold it, hold it.</i>

404
00:33:11,152 --> 00:33:14,489
- What's up?
- I try to find "Cronow. " He don't show up in class.

405
00:33:14,594 --> 00:33:19,182
He didn't show up for work today
either. You know anything about this?

406
00:33:19,286 --> 00:33:20,711
Listen, jerkoff!

407
00:33:20,746 --> 00:33:24,291
We're here fighting for your country!
Now where did Cronauer go?

408
00:33:24,396 --> 00:33:26,480
An Lac. His pass say "An Lac. "

409
00:33:26,585 --> 00:33:29,713
An Lac? Shit!

410
00:33:42,019 --> 00:33:45,772
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah. You okay?

411
00:33:45,877 --> 00:33:47,858
No.

412
00:33:49,526 --> 00:33:51,820
Come on, pal.
We'll make it.

413
00:33:51,926 --> 00:33:54,011
- I have a hunch.
- Yeah.

414
00:33:54,046 --> 00:33:56,096
<i>Baby, please don't go</i>

415
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,954
- VC. The fuckin' VC.
- Tell me somethin' I don't know, okay?

416
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:05,167
<i>On that midnight train</i>

417
00:34:13,823 --> 00:34:15,700
<i>Baby, please don't go</i>

418
00:34:15,804 --> 00:34:20,705
- How far you think we've gone?
- Ten, fifteen miles.

419
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:23,520
Think we've reached Cambodia yet?

420
00:34:23,624 --> 00:34:26,857
How can you fight a war
in this shit?

421
00:34:26,961 --> 00:34:29,360
I don't know where they are.
I don't even know where I am.

422
00:34:29,395 --> 00:34:33,322
Can't see dick.
Like hunting with Ray Charles.

423
00:34:38,223 --> 00:34:41,213
It okay! You can come out now.

424
00:34:41,248 --> 00:34:45,105
If you here, I cannot find you
unless you talk to me.

425
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:47,086
It's too dangerous
staying here.

426
00:34:47,191 --> 00:34:52,406
You don't believe it's me?
Okay. Flip them the bird!

427
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,306
- Tuan?
- Hey, there you are, "Cronow. "

428
00:34:57,410 --> 00:34:59,601
How the hell'd you
find us, Sparky?

429
00:34:59,636 --> 00:35:02,937
Your Jeep.

430
00:35:03,042 --> 00:35:06,274
We're obviously not in Cambodia.

431
00:35:09,089 --> 00:35:11,384
Try it again.

432
00:35:13,365 --> 00:35:16,181
One more time.

433
00:35:18,683 --> 00:35:22,750
God damn it. Our Jeep gets blown off
the road, and his van won't start.

434
00:35:22,855 --> 00:35:27,025
- That's great. You know why we ended up in the same place?
- Why is that?

435
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:29,632
Your limp pulled us to the right.
We were going around in circles.

436
00:35:29,667 --> 00:35:32,552
Stick with me. I don't want
to go around again.

437
00:35:35,054 --> 00:35:37,348
We're not in Kansas
any more, Toto.

438
00:35:43,501 --> 00:35:45,586
Listen.

439
00:35:52,991 --> 00:35:55,180
Somewhere over there.

440
00:35:57,161 --> 00:35:59,664
There it is, man. Yo!

441
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:04,982
Yo! Right there!

442
00:36:05,086 --> 00:36:08,111
Yo, GI!
Hello, sailor! Hello!

443
00:36:09,153 --> 00:36:11,552
Boogaloo, boogaloo! Hey!

444
00:36:48,152 --> 00:36:53,366
To avoid razor burn problems, always rinse
your razor with cold water instead of hot.

445
00:36:53,471 --> 00:36:56,702
Your skin will look and feel
a whole lot better.

446
00:36:56,808 --> 00:36:59,414
That's it for "Hygiene in the Heat. "
Tomorrow we'll-

447
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:02,751
- Welcome back.
- Thank you, Sergeant. I've missed you.

448
00:37:05,776 --> 00:37:11,301
I'm informing you that you're outta here. I want
your bags packed and ready to go tomorrow afternoon.

449
00:37:11,406 --> 00:37:15,473
- You don't have the power. I'll take this right to the authorities.
- I am the authorities, you moron!

450
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:24,754
Oh, I got your pansy ass
in a sling now, Cronauer. Who's Tuan?

451
00:37:24,857 --> 00:37:28,820
The guys who flew you in from An Lac radioed they'd picked
up a young South Vietnamese boy with you and Garlick.

452
00:37:28,925 --> 00:37:33,304
- Who is this South Vietnamese boy?
- He's a friend from my class who risked his ass to save my life.

453
00:37:33,408 --> 00:37:37,372
A friend?
Your friend is a VC terrorist.

454
00:37:37,475 --> 00:37:39,456
Yeah, and my mother's
a werewolf, right? Yeah.

455
00:37:39,561 --> 00:37:41,959
Tuan is also known as
Phan Duc Tho.

456
00:37:42,063 --> 00:37:46,548
He's currently wanted by the South Vietnamese police
in connection with several bombings in the area...

457
00:37:46,651 --> 00:37:49,467
including the one
at Jimmy Wah's.

458
00:37:49,571 --> 00:37:52,804
Surely you're familiar
with that incident.

459
00:37:52,908 --> 00:37:58,539
Did you ever wonder how a young South Vietnamese
boy gets into and out of VC-held territory.

460
00:37:58,643 --> 00:38:02,398
It's dangerous out there.
Things just jump out at you.

461
00:38:02,502 --> 00:38:05,735
And yet this boy can get in
and out without a scratch.

462
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:08,966
And what about Jimmy Wah's? Didn't you
ever wonder why you were pulled out...

463
00:38:09,071 --> 00:38:11,991
just moments before
the whole place blew up?

464
00:38:12,095 --> 00:38:15,015
Or are you normally
not that inquisitive?

465
00:38:17,622 --> 00:38:20,125
Friends of Phan Duc Tho.

466
00:38:20,228 --> 00:38:24,504
These three were executed shortly
after this photo was taken.

467
00:38:29,092 --> 00:38:31,074
Your friend is next.

468
00:38:33,367 --> 00:38:35,557
I don't recommend that you tangle
with me on this one, Airman.

469
00:38:35,661 --> 00:38:40,771
There's not too many high-ranking officers would be
sympathetic to a serviceman with links to terrorists.

470
00:38:40,875 --> 00:38:43,795
The army is kind of
quirky that way.

471
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:47,341
A conviction on the charge of treason against the
United States carries with it some penalties...

472
00:38:47,444 --> 00:38:50,573
kind of on the stiff side,
if you know what I mean.

473
00:38:50,677 --> 00:38:55,474
I have arranged for an honourable discharge,
provided you leave without incident.

474
00:38:55,579 --> 00:38:58,186
- Ten hut.
- At ease.

475
00:39:02,565 --> 00:39:06,214
Cronauer, I'm sorry as hell about
this thing. God damn it, I like you, son.

476
00:39:06,319 --> 00:39:10,595
I like what you do. Most of all,
I like what you've done for the men.

477
00:39:10,698 --> 00:39:13,827
But facts are facts.

478
00:39:13,931 --> 00:39:18,832
This could give the army a black eye. I'm
not gonna cover for you this time, son.

479
00:39:18,936 --> 00:39:21,648
Sir? What about the show?

480
00:39:23,837 --> 00:39:26,027
We'll handle it.

481
00:39:26,131 --> 00:39:28,948
I'm sorry, son.

482
00:39:33,223 --> 00:39:36,873
Why'd you do this?

483
00:39:36,977 --> 00:39:40,939
I don't like your style,
your politics or your sense of humour.

484
00:39:41,043 --> 00:39:43,755
I don't like what you say
or how you say it.

485
00:39:43,859 --> 00:39:47,404
From now on, the fighting men of Vietnam will
hear exactly what they're supposed to hear.

486
00:39:47,508 --> 00:39:51,680
You're on a DC-8 from Tan Son Nhut
airport tomorrow at 1830 hours.

487
00:39:51,784 --> 00:39:54,494
I recommend
you pack quietly.

488
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:57,414
That's all I have
for you, Airman.

489
00:40:08,363 --> 00:40:10,136
You know...

490
00:40:10,242 --> 00:40:13,994
you're in more dire need of a blow job
than any white man in history.

491
00:40:19,729 --> 00:40:24,318
Whoa, there, Dick. Put the brakes on. I wanted
to wait till the airman left to talk with you.

492
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:27,655
Uh, Dick,
I'm transferring you.

493
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:30,053
- Transferring me, sir?
- Mm-hmm.

494
00:40:30,157 --> 00:40:33,390
- Where to, sir?
- You're going to Guam.

495
00:40:33,494 --> 00:40:36,623
Guam, sir! There's nothin' goin'
on in Guam! Why Guam?

496
00:40:36,726 --> 00:40:40,689
Dick, I've covered for you a lot of times
'cause I thought you was a little crazy.

497
00:40:40,794 --> 00:40:45,381
But you're not crazy. You're mean.
And this is just radio.

498
00:40:54,871 --> 00:41:00,085
"More dire need of a blow job than
any white man in history. " That's funny.

499
00:41:10,408 --> 00:41:13,953
Hey, Teacher! When are you gonna
teach us the softball?

500
00:41:14,058 --> 00:41:16,769
Listen, I gotta talk to you.
Now! Come on.

501
00:41:16,873 --> 00:41:18,959
- Mr Cronauer, I must talk to you.
- Oh, Minh, not now.

502
00:41:19,063 --> 00:41:21,149
- Listen, you gotta tell me where your brother is.
- Don't know.

503
00:41:21,253 --> 00:41:24,903
Listen, his life is in danger.
You gotta tell me where the hell he is.

504
00:41:25,007 --> 00:41:26,988
- No, I don't-
- Bullshit!

505
00:41:27,093 --> 00:41:31,785
Listen. No more games, okay?
The army knows about your brother.

506
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:34,913
I have to leave the country
because of my association with him.

507
00:41:35,018 --> 00:41:38,667
They have pictures of him.
If they find him, they will shoot him.

508
00:41:38,772 --> 00:41:42,421
If you want to continue to have
a brother, you take me to him now!

509
00:42:54,059 --> 00:42:56,353
Phan Duc Tho!

510
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:03,340
Get back here!

511
00:44:03,299 --> 00:44:05,280
Know about
the bombings, Sparky.

512
00:44:06,845 --> 00:44:09,556
No wonder you hauled ass.

513
00:44:16,125 --> 00:44:18,106
You were my friend.

514
00:44:20,609 --> 00:44:22,591
I trusted you.

515
00:44:26,448 --> 00:44:29,160
You hear me?

516
00:44:29,264 --> 00:44:33,122
You naive man, "Cronow. "
You take a stupid side.

517
00:44:33,227 --> 00:44:36,146
Now you have to go.
It's better off.

518
00:44:36,251 --> 00:44:38,753
That's not the fucking point!

519
00:44:40,317 --> 00:44:42,612
Understand me?

520
00:44:42,717 --> 00:44:47,617
I fought to get you into that bar,
and then you blow the fuckin' place up.

521
00:44:49,076 --> 00:44:54,708
Listen. I gave you
my friendship and my trust...

522
00:44:54,812 --> 00:44:58,462
and now they tell me that
my best friend is the goddam enemy!

523
00:44:58,566 --> 00:45:01,069
Enemy? What is enemy?

524
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:05,448
You killing my own people
so many miles from your home.

525
00:45:05,552 --> 00:45:09,098
We not the enemy.
You the enemy!

526
00:45:09,201 --> 00:45:13,269
You used me to kill two people.
Two people died in that fuckin' bar.

527
00:45:13,374 --> 00:45:16,084
Big fucking deal!

528
00:45:16,189 --> 00:45:18,691
My mother is dead.

529
00:45:18,796 --> 00:45:23,280
And my older brother,
who be 29 years old, he dead.

530
00:45:23,384 --> 00:45:25,261
Shot by Americans.

531
00:45:26,512 --> 00:45:30,266
My neighbour, dead.
His wife, dead.

532
00:45:30,370 --> 00:45:32,664
Why?

533
00:45:32,768 --> 00:45:35,271
Because we're not
human to them.

534
00:45:35,376 --> 00:45:37,565
We're only little Vietnamese.

535
00:45:41,528 --> 00:45:44,761
And I'm stupid enough to save
your bullshit life at An Lac.

536
00:45:52,268 --> 00:45:54,145
Wait.

537
00:45:54,249 --> 00:45:58,525
We're here to help this country.
Where the fuck you goin'?

538
00:46:07,805 --> 00:46:10,204
It's unbelievable.

539
00:46:10,308 --> 00:46:12,810
Five months in Saigon...

540
00:46:12,915 --> 00:46:16,564
and my best friend
turns out to be a VC.

541
00:46:16,670 --> 00:46:19,902
This will not look good
on a rsum!

542
00:46:35,126 --> 00:46:38,358
- You guys mind if I drive?
- Be my guest.

543
00:46:52,853 --> 00:46:57,234
It's a simple rule. If the engine's
humming, it's already started.

544
00:46:57,337 --> 00:47:01,299
Never fails. You guys mind if we make a little
unscheduled stop? I got something I gotta do.

545
00:47:01,404 --> 00:47:05,992
If you attempt to deviate from the aforeplanned
schedule, you're under arrest, Cronauer.

546
00:47:06,930 --> 00:47:08,808
Okay, everybody, let's play ball!

547
00:47:08,912 --> 00:47:11,414
Go into conference.
That point. That fence.

548
00:47:11,519 --> 00:47:14,126
- Okay, here we go.
- Go, batter. Go, batter.

549
00:47:15,168 --> 00:47:17,358
Whoa! Headin' north!

550
00:47:17,463 --> 00:47:20,277
Let's go! Was it a double
or a daiquiri?

551
00:47:20,382 --> 00:47:23,823
Wait a minute.
All right!

552
00:47:23,928 --> 00:47:26,847
Thank you!

553
00:47:26,951 --> 00:47:30,184
Whoa. A little conference here, Wilk.
A little conference. Time out, everyone.

554
00:47:30,288 --> 00:47:35,606
This not like a real baseball. It's much
smaller and harder than- than this one.

555
00:47:35,711 --> 00:47:38,735
You got me there, Wilk, because-
I'm sorry. We have no budget, you see.

556
00:47:38,838 --> 00:47:42,802
And I gotta get on a plane, and we have
to do with what we can. Give me your hand.

557
00:47:42,906 --> 00:47:45,096
- Thank you. - Thank you.
- Thank you all the same.

558
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:49,267
- Thank you all the same, and-
You wanna take the ball? - No.

559
00:47:49,372 --> 00:47:51,665
Okay. We gotta play, Wilk.
You're pitchin'. There's only-

560
00:47:51,769 --> 00:47:54,063
I want to turn in the ball to the-
see, the original place.

561
00:47:54,167 --> 00:47:57,296
- Okay. Let's take one more ball here. This one's a better one.
- No, no.

562
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:59,903
- Not that one? - No need. - We
haven't got a real baseball, Wilk.

563
00:48:00,008 --> 00:48:02,615
- Bear with me, okay? - Okay.
- We haven't got the money, pal.

564
00:48:02,719 --> 00:48:06,160
- Anyway- - Okay? Is that one okay? - I
accept that this is a very good substitute.

565
00:48:06,264 --> 00:48:09,393
- Okay. Let's just play with the substitute then, okay?
- Okay.

566
00:48:09,497 --> 00:48:11,999
- Okay. - This is a deal. -
It's a deal? - This is a deal.

567
00:48:12,103 --> 00:48:14,919
Okay, take the ball with you, then, Wilk.
I'll give you money if you take the ball.

568
00:48:15,023 --> 00:48:17,004
- No. - No? -
I'm sorry. - Okay.

569
00:48:17,109 --> 00:48:20,967
- I'm-I'm- I've no money. Sorry.
- Is there a psychiatrist here?

570
00:48:24,199 --> 00:48:26,806
Whoa! Whoa!

571
00:48:26,911 --> 00:48:29,727
Whoa! Whoa!

572
00:48:29,831 --> 00:48:34,106
Yeah! Go!
Run, run, run! Okay.

573
00:48:34,209 --> 00:48:37,130
He's not out till you have
both hands on the ball!

574
00:48:37,234 --> 00:48:40,154
Keep your eye on the fruit.
That's it. Eye on the fruit.

575
00:48:40,258 --> 00:48:42,239
Okay, on the fruit,
on the fruit.

576
00:48:42,343 --> 00:48:45,056
- Go, go! Run, Minh! Run! -
Come on, Minh! - Run, Minh!

577
00:48:48,184 --> 00:48:50,060
Keep go- Keep going!

578
00:48:50,165 --> 00:48:55,379
<i>- She's actually goin' home.
- Well, I'm goin'out West where I belong</i>

579
00:48:55,482 --> 00:49:01,217
<i>- That's it. We'll all change sides.
- Where the days are short and the night are long</i>

580
00:49:01,322 --> 00:49:04,658
<i>- Yes, Wilkie!
- Well, they walk and I walk</i>

581
00:49:04,763 --> 00:49:07,996
<i>- They twist and I'll twist
- Hey, Wilk. Wilk, you got a base hit.</i>

582
00:49:08,099 --> 00:49:12,792
<i>They shimmy and I'll shimmy
They fly and I'll fly</i>

583
00:49:12,897 --> 00:49:15,921
<i>Well, they're out there
a- havin'fun</i>

584
00:49:16,025 --> 00:49:18,736
<i>In that warm California sun</i>

585
00:49:18,841 --> 00:49:22,386
<i>Well, I'm goin'out West
out on the coast</i>

586
00:49:23,950 --> 00:49:26,870
<i>Where the California girls
are really the most</i>

587
00:49:29,477 --> 00:49:31,666
<i>Where they walk
and I'll walk</i>

588
00:49:31,772 --> 00:49:34,691
<i>They twist
and I'll twist</i>

589
00:49:34,794 --> 00:49:38,340
<i>They shimmy
and I'll shimmy</i>

590
00:49:38,445 --> 00:49:41,051
<i>They fly
and I'll fly</i>

591
00:49:41,156 --> 00:49:44,180
<i>Well, they're out there

592
00:49:44,215 --> 00:49:47,204
<i>In that warm California sun</i>

593
00:49:52,626 --> 00:49:55,233
Yeah, me too.
Hey, hey. Oh, hey.

594
00:49:55,338 --> 00:49:57,944
When you look like Goliath,
so might you...

595
00:49:58,048 --> 00:50:01,073
- You take care. Take care.
- beware of-of some-some David.

596
00:50:01,177 --> 00:50:03,158
We had a great day.

597
00:50:04,305 --> 00:50:06,182
Thank you.

598
00:50:07,851 --> 00:50:12,752
Well, Mr Cronauer, we, we thank-thank you
for your fine teaching about softball...

599
00:50:12,855 --> 00:50:17,444
and we have learned a lot from you
and we wish you good luck and success.

600
00:50:17,548 --> 00:50:19,426
- Thank you, Wilkie. -
Thank you. - Thank you.

601
00:50:19,529 --> 00:50:21,823
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

602
00:50:27,872 --> 00:50:31,208
- You guys ready to go?
- Can you give me a minute?

603
00:50:34,546 --> 00:50:37,882
Man, he's gonna say goodbye to
the whole goddam country now.

604
00:50:47,163 --> 00:50:50,604
I want to say goodbye
before you go.

605
00:50:53,107 --> 00:50:55,296
To tell you...

606
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:58,216
thank you for being so kind.

607
00:50:59,676 --> 00:51:03,014
So many things not happen
the way you want it.

608
00:51:05,933 --> 00:51:08,957
You so good person...

609
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:11,355
but I could not with you.

610
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,839
We are so different.

611
00:51:15,943 --> 00:51:18,654
I say "tomato. "
You say "xioh phoung. "

612
00:51:40,553 --> 00:51:42,429
See you.

613
00:51:51,814 --> 00:51:55,464
- Staggers the imagination.
- Makes me unique, doesn't it?

614
00:51:55,568 --> 00:52:00,156
- What a plus.
- Flip them the bird!

615
00:52:22,993 --> 00:52:25,288
Left, right!

616
00:52:45,204 --> 00:52:47,185
Three, four!

617
00:52:52,712 --> 00:52:54,901
Left, left!
Left, right, left!

618
00:52:55,006 --> 00:52:57,718
Left, left!
Left, right, left!

619
00:53:00,950 --> 00:53:05,016
Left, left!
Left, right, left!

620
00:53:24,413 --> 00:53:28,583
It was a pleasure making
your acquaintance, sir. Thanks.

621
00:53:28,687 --> 00:53:33,171
- Cut that out, Garlick. We're the same rank.
- What will I do without you, sir?

622
00:53:33,276 --> 00:53:37,239
- Well, you carry on, Montesque.
- Carry on, Montesque.

623
00:53:37,342 --> 00:53:41,930
Carry on. I like that. It makes me feel,
uh, British or something.

624
00:53:42,034 --> 00:53:44,642
I've got something here
for you.

625
00:53:44,747 --> 00:53:48,188
I want you to play this. It says
goodbye to everybody stayin' behind.

626
00:53:48,291 --> 00:53:51,524
- I'll take care of it pronto, sir.
- You could get in trouble for that.

627
00:53:51,629 --> 00:53:55,278
I requisitioned for a name change.
Trouble is actually my new middle name.

628
00:53:58,719 --> 00:54:01,847
Well, I'll give you the old chuck
on the shoulder now.

629
00:54:01,952 --> 00:54:05,288
It's a stupid thing to do,
isn't it?

630
00:54:05,393 --> 00:54:07,791
You take care.

631
00:54:07,896 --> 00:54:10,816
Ed, your fly's open.

632
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:13,943
Made you look.

633
00:54:36,051 --> 00:54:39,805
Good morning, Vietnam!

634
00:54:39,908 --> 00:54:42,933
This is Eddie Garlick
coming to you live from AFRS...

635
00:54:43,037 --> 00:54:45,330
Armed Forces Radio Saigon.

636
00:54:45,435 --> 00:54:50,024
It's 1629 hours here in Saigon, and
Airman Adrian Cronauer is going home today.

637
00:54:50,128 --> 00:54:54,298
But he left a farewell message for all you guys
out there still sweating it out in the fields.

638
00:54:54,403 --> 00:54:58,261
So without further ado,
here's a farewell extravaganza.

639
00:54:58,366 --> 00:55:02,536
<i>Goodbye, Vietnam!</i>

640
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:06,395
<i>That's right, I'm history. I'm out of
here. I got the lucky ticket home, baby.</i>

641
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:10,045
<i>Rollin', rollin', rollin'
Keep them wagons rollin', Rawhide</i>

642
00:55:10,149 --> 00:55:12,859
<i>Yeah, that's right.
The final Adrian Cronauer broadcast.</i>

643
00:55:12,964 --> 00:55:15,571
<i>And this one is brought to you
by our friends at the Pentagon.</i>

644
00:55:15,676 --> 00:55:19,325
<i>Remember the people who brought you
Korea? That's right. The US Army.</i>

645
00:55:19,430 --> 00:55:23,705
<i>If it's being done correctly, here or abroad,
it's probably not being done by the Army.</i>

646
00:55:23,809 --> 00:55:27,459
<i>"I heard that. "Oh, ho,
you're here! Good to see you.</i>

647
00:55:27,563 --> 00:55:32,464
<i>"I'm here to make sure
you don't say anything controversial. "</i>

648
00:55:32,568 --> 00:55:37,157
<i>Speaking of things controversial, is it true
that there is a marijuana problem here in Vietnam?</i>

649
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:41,119
<i>"No, it's not a problem.
Everybody has it. "</i>

650
00:55:41,223 --> 00:55:43,934
<i>"I don't know, Adrian. "
Leo! Leo.</i>

651
00:55:44,039 --> 00:55:48,418
<i>"Adrian, take care of yourself.
I just want you to know one thing.</i>

652
00:55:48,523 --> 00:55:52,172
<i>If you're going to be dressing in
civilian clothes, don't forget pumps. "</i>

653
00:55:52,277 --> 00:55:55,197
<i>Thank you, Leo. Thanks for these.
Oh, these are special.</i>

654
00:55:55,301 --> 00:55:59,472
<i>"They're ruby slippers, Adrian. Put these
on and say, 'There's no place like home...</i>

655
00:55:59,576 --> 00:56:02,495
<i>there's no place like home, '
and you can be there. "</i>

656
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:05,624
<i>I hope.
I hope we all could.</i>

657
00:56:06,624 --> 00:56:16,624
