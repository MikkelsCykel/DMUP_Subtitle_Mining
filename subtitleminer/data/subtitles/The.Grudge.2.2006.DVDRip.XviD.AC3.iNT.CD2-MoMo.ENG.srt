1
00:00:03,362 --> 00:00:04,522
Come in.

2
00:00:08,467 --> 00:00:11,834
Vanessa, please have a seat.

3
00:00:17,977 --> 00:00:23,142
Allison has been telling me an
interesting story that I'd like you to verify.

4
00:00:23,282 --> 00:00:24,943
A story about what?

5
00:00:26,285 --> 00:00:31,052
About a visit you made with her
and Miyuki Nazawa to a certain house.

6
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:33,852
I'm sorry, Miss Dale,
but I don't know what she told you.

7
00:00:33,993 --> 00:00:38,657
Please, Vanessa,
no one is in trouble here.

8
00:00:39,398 --> 00:00:43,266
I just need to find out exactly
what happened in that house.

9
00:00:52,612 --> 00:00:54,375
Miyuki is missing.

10
00:00:55,214 --> 00:00:57,079
We just got the call.

11
00:00:57,216 --> 00:01:00,583
Apparently she never came home
last night.

12
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:04,178
She said she was going to be
with her boyfriend, Michael.

13
00:01:04,323 --> 00:01:09,192
Yes, we've spoken with him.
He said she disappeared.

14
00:01:09,328 --> 00:01:14,095
Now you can understand, Vanessa,
how important it is that we hear the truth.

15
00:01:15,735 --> 00:01:17,794
Why did you do this to me?

16
00:01:19,038 --> 00:01:22,496
Why did you take me to that place?

17
00:01:24,744 --> 00:01:26,609
You wanted to come.

18
00:01:26,746 --> 00:01:29,044
What did I ever do to you?

19
00:01:29,181 --> 00:01:30,842
Allison, wait!

20
00:01:30,983 --> 00:01:32,348
Wait here.

21
00:03:34,974 --> 00:03:36,236
Miyuki?

22
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:12,974
Miyuki... is that you?

23
00:04:54,587 --> 00:04:56,851
- Wait here.
- No, II... want --

24
00:04:56,989 --> 00:04:59,753
Please. Just stay here.

25
00:06:52,771 --> 00:06:53,931
Eason...

26
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:21,156
Aubrey...

27
00:07:22,701 --> 00:07:24,965
please don't go in that house.

28
00:07:37,549 --> 00:07:40,211
Aubrey! What are you doing in here?

29
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:43,221
Something pulled me in.

30
00:07:44,957 --> 00:07:47,721
- I told you to stay outside.
- I didn't know...

31
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,923
We have to go. Now.

32
00:07:59,672 --> 00:08:02,334
Kayako kept this journal her whole life.

33
00:08:03,175 --> 00:08:05,837
She was only eight
when she wrote this part.

34
00:08:09,381 --> 00:08:12,350
I don't understand it,
but it looks creepy as hell.

35
00:08:13,886 --> 00:08:17,549
It's not creepy. It's sad.

36
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:20,158
Apparently, her mother was an Itako.

37
00:08:20,893 --> 00:08:22,554
Itako? What is that?

38
00:08:26,198 --> 00:08:27,995
It's a kind of channeler.

39
00:08:28,634 --> 00:08:32,001
People believe they can talk with
deceased loved ones through them.

40
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:37,598
But... I don't understand this part.

41
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:44,013
I have a friend. He's really into folklore.
I think he can help us.

42
00:08:52,057 --> 00:08:54,218
This is not Itako.

43
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:59,027
Wait.

44
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:10,740
This person who is written in diary
did channeler, but...

45
00:09:10,876 --> 00:09:16,246
I can't say
this is channeler exactly.

46
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:21,346
I mean, something...

47
00:09:23,989 --> 00:09:28,289
He says what Kayako wrote was about
the rituaIs her mother performed...

48
00:09:29,228 --> 00:09:31,492
and how they were somewhat abnormal.

49
00:09:40,939 --> 00:09:45,205
I can't explain it in English.

50
00:09:45,744 --> 00:09:46,904
Shaman...

51
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:50,208
Exorcist.

52
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:55,215
It must be named Exorcist.

53
00:09:56,755 --> 00:10:01,624
There's no real word to
describe it in English, but...

54
00:10:03,262 --> 00:10:05,730
the closest thing would be 'exorcist'.

55
00:10:14,573 --> 00:10:18,942
She did this to her daugter.

56
00:10:19,478 --> 00:10:25,348
Take demon away from
people's mind or body.

57
00:10:26,285 --> 00:10:29,152
- What is it?
- She let daugter eat

58
00:10:29,288 --> 00:10:31,654
- Eason...?
- demon everyday.

59
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:32,950
Eason!

60
00:10:33,792 --> 00:10:36,158
I've never heard bout it.

61
00:10:37,296 --> 00:10:40,959
It... it sounds like her mother
was able to cure people

62
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:43,659
through extracting evil spirits...

63
00:10:44,303 --> 00:10:46,271
out of their bodies...

64
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:51,872
and feeding them to her daughter.

65
00:10:53,011 --> 00:10:54,171
What?

66
00:11:18,837 --> 00:11:20,896
First thing tomorrow
morning we have to go see her.

67
00:11:22,441 --> 00:11:23,601
See who?

68
00:11:25,844 --> 00:11:27,243
Kayako's mother.

69
00:11:34,086 --> 00:11:38,455
I've tried everything.
I even went back to the house. I...

70
00:11:41,193 --> 00:11:42,353
Look...

71
00:11:43,395 --> 00:11:49,061
if she can really take evil spirits
out of people, maybe she can help us.

72
00:11:53,305 --> 00:11:55,671
I don't know what to believe any more.

73
00:11:59,811 --> 00:12:03,679
We don't have a choice.
It's our only hope.

74
00:12:05,817 --> 00:12:07,079
Okay.

75
00:12:23,235 --> 00:12:25,897
This is the research
I was doing for the story.

76
00:12:26,038 --> 00:12:28,836
I've got her childhood address...

77
00:12:31,577 --> 00:12:32,737
right here.

78
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:46,955
It's a small village.

79
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:57,665
The train will only take us haIfway.
We'lI have to switch to a bus.

80
00:13:08,113 --> 00:13:11,378
Last time I saw Karen,
we got into this huge fight.

81
00:13:13,218 --> 00:13:14,981
It was really stupid.

82
00:13:18,924 --> 00:13:23,486
She took me out to lunch and she
dropped this college application on me...

83
00:13:23,629 --> 00:13:26,826
and I... I was just...

84
00:13:38,877 --> 00:13:40,845
I was so pissed.

85
00:13:46,084 --> 00:13:48,644
I thought she was trying to be
just like my mother.

86
00:13:50,889 --> 00:13:55,553
I screamed at her to stop trying
to change my life and leave me alone.

87
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:01,560
She did.

88
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:06,964
We never spoke again until last night.

89
00:14:11,109 --> 00:14:17,878
I always, I always blamed Karen for
my mother's indifference towards me.

90
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:24,389
But I know that wasn't true,
and I really...

91
00:14:26,124 --> 00:14:27,614
I really regret...

92
00:14:31,063 --> 00:14:34,931
Well, you know, it's strange.

93
00:14:35,467 --> 00:14:40,632
Back in Hong Kong, my brother lived
a few blocks away from me for four years.

94
00:14:41,373 --> 00:14:44,137
We never even tried to see each other.

95
00:14:52,384 --> 00:14:53,646
I'll make some tea.

96
00:14:54,286 --> 00:14:55,548
Yeah, thanks.

97
00:17:48,159 --> 00:17:49,524
Eason?

98
00:18:01,373 --> 00:18:02,635
Eason?

99
00:18:25,096 --> 00:18:27,394
Eason? Are you in here?

100
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,802
Eason?

101
00:19:06,071 --> 00:19:07,231
Eason?

102
00:19:12,978 --> 00:19:14,138
Eason...

103
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:19,341
Eason... Eason!

104
00:19:19,484 --> 00:19:20,644
Eason!

105
00:19:51,549 --> 00:19:53,608
Jeez, you sick or something?

106
00:19:56,354 --> 00:19:58,914
So... what do you think?

107
00:20:16,775 --> 00:20:18,538
Sally, are you okay?

108
00:20:38,196 --> 00:20:39,356
Jake?

109
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,268
No, it's okay.
I'll be right there.

110
00:20:46,204 --> 00:20:47,671
I have to go.

111
00:20:59,818 --> 00:21:00,978
Jake?

112
00:21:17,435 --> 00:21:18,595
Jake?

113
00:21:30,682 --> 00:21:32,741
God!

114
00:21:33,184 --> 00:21:35,744
Jake. What are you doing in here?

115
00:21:35,887 --> 00:21:39,755
I... I was scared.

116
00:21:39,891 --> 00:21:41,950
What were you scared of?

117
00:21:42,093 --> 00:21:43,560
Trish.

118
00:21:45,096 --> 00:21:46,563
And Dad.

119
00:21:50,401 --> 00:21:52,665
They were fighting, Lacey.

120
00:21:55,306 --> 00:21:56,671
Where are they?

121
00:21:58,109 --> 00:22:01,875
I... I don't know...

122
00:22:02,814 --> 00:22:05,282
But I wish Mom was here.

123
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:11,383
Jake...

124
00:23:06,611 --> 00:23:08,169
Mr. Fleming?

125
00:24:15,913 --> 00:24:17,073
Hi...

126
00:24:58,289 --> 00:24:59,756
What's wrong, Jake?

127
00:24:59,891 --> 00:25:02,758
I went next door and I...

128
00:25:03,494 --> 00:25:06,156
- You went where?
- Next door.

129
00:25:07,598 --> 00:25:11,659
I saw something in the window -- eyes.

130
00:25:11,803 --> 00:25:14,169
It's all right, Jake. It's okay.

131
00:25:14,305 --> 00:25:16,671
Something is really wrong, Lacey.

132
00:25:18,009 --> 00:25:21,467
Tomorrow l promise
I'll go there with you. Okay?

133
00:25:23,314 --> 00:25:26,283
Just try and get some sleep now.

134
00:26:07,992 --> 00:26:09,357
Dammit!

135
00:26:57,775 --> 00:26:59,640
You got home late last night.

136
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:04,042
Where were you?

137
00:27:10,988 --> 00:27:12,148
Come in.

138
00:27:23,701 --> 00:27:25,066
Allison...

139
00:27:26,938 --> 00:27:28,906
Allison, are you all right?

140
00:27:30,541 --> 00:27:32,509
Maybe we should go see the nurse.

141
00:27:33,444 --> 00:27:35,002
I want to go home.

142
00:27:42,253 --> 00:27:44,118
Take a breath.

143
00:27:44,255 --> 00:27:48,214
Tell me what's going on.
You can talk to me.

144
00:27:52,763 --> 00:27:54,424
It was that house.

145
00:27:57,068 --> 00:28:01,129
There was something there
when I was there.

146
00:28:01,272 --> 00:28:02,432
I...

147
00:28:09,881 --> 00:28:13,248
I just want to go home.

148
00:28:14,385 --> 00:28:19,755
Allison, Listen...
I've been to that house with the police.

149
00:28:19,891 --> 00:28:22,257
There's nothing there.

150
00:28:22,393 --> 00:28:25,658
It's just an abandoned house.

151
00:28:26,931 --> 00:28:30,992
You... went there?

152
00:28:35,439 --> 00:28:37,805
Yes, I did.

153
00:28:38,843 --> 00:28:40,708
She's going to come for you.

154
00:28:42,847 --> 00:28:46,613
She got Miyuki and Vanessa...

155
00:28:46,751 --> 00:28:49,117
and now she's after me.

156
00:28:49,253 --> 00:28:50,413
Allison...

157
00:28:53,558 --> 00:28:55,719
I don't know what you're talking about.

158
00:28:58,462 --> 00:29:00,726
- What?
- They are right here.

159
00:31:35,386 --> 00:31:36,648
Hello?

160
00:32:13,324 --> 00:32:16,487
I need to speak to you about
your daughter Kayako.

161
00:32:20,231 --> 00:32:24,497
I saw the journal.
I know you can get rid of evil spirits.

162
00:32:27,171 --> 00:32:29,036
She is dead.

163
00:32:30,674 --> 00:32:32,835
You did this.
You made her what she was.

164
00:32:32,977 --> 00:32:35,445
Now, I need you to help me
help me end this.

165
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:36,944
Wait...!

166
00:32:42,887 --> 00:32:46,254
People came looking for me.

167
00:32:47,792 --> 00:32:50,659
Full of pain and suffering...

168
00:33:02,606 --> 00:33:05,973
I took the dark spirits from them.

169
00:33:08,012 --> 00:33:10,572
And so did my daughter.

170
00:33:11,115 --> 00:33:15,074
You poisoned her.
Look what she has become.

171
00:33:17,421 --> 00:33:20,879
I didnot create this evil.

172
00:33:21,025 --> 00:33:26,088
Kayako was killed by her
husband because she was foolish.

173
00:33:27,064 --> 00:33:29,430
That is where the curse started.

174
00:33:30,467 --> 00:33:33,732
I didnot make her what she is now.

175
00:33:36,874 --> 00:33:40,435
My sister tried to burn down
the house where Kayako was killed.

176
00:33:41,478 --> 00:33:43,446
She thought if she burned down
the house that it would stop?

177
00:33:43,581 --> 00:33:46,448
This is not about a house.

178
00:33:47,785 --> 00:33:51,653
You are just making things worse.

179
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:54,749
This is rage.

180
00:33:56,093 --> 00:34:00,359
She wants us to suffer the way
she has suffered.

181
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:07,360
- No. We have to make it stop.
- No, it will not stop.

182
00:34:09,106 --> 00:34:13,770
It will grow
and destroy everything it touches.

183
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:17,574
It will spread beyond the house.

184
00:34:19,617 --> 00:34:23,178
There can be no end to what has started.

185
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:32,120
You brought her here.

186
00:36:27,845 --> 00:36:29,005
Hey.

187
00:36:30,047 --> 00:36:31,605
Are you okay?

188
00:36:31,749 --> 00:36:33,307
Something bad.

189
00:36:35,052 --> 00:36:36,212
What?

190
00:36:36,353 --> 00:36:38,719
Something bad lives there.

191
00:36:40,057 --> 00:36:42,719
That is what's making
everything eIse bad here.

192
00:36:47,765 --> 00:36:50,734
Come on, Jake.
Let's go.

193
00:37:04,081 --> 00:37:05,241
Dad...?

194
00:37:06,984 --> 00:37:08,349
Trish?

195
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:24,762
Dad...?

196
00:37:45,756 --> 00:37:47,314
Just wait here.

197
00:37:48,659 --> 00:37:51,719
Dad? Trish?

198
00:38:07,578 --> 00:38:08,738
Hello?

199
00:38:11,882 --> 00:38:13,247
Hi, Mom, it's me.

200
00:38:13,383 --> 00:38:16,352
I've been waiting for you.

201
00:38:17,788 --> 00:38:22,555
Where have you been?
How is Karen?

202
00:38:28,332 --> 00:38:30,994
She's gone, mom.

203
00:38:33,537 --> 00:38:36,097
- I'm sorry.
- She's gone?

204
00:38:43,247 --> 00:38:45,909
I know how much you loved her. I...

205
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:48,811
I know she was everything to you.

206
00:38:48,952 --> 00:38:53,616
Why have you done this? You were...
You were supposed to bring her back!

207
00:38:55,058 --> 00:38:57,720
You could never do anything
on your own

208
00:39:01,265 --> 00:39:03,324
I love you so much...

209
00:39:05,769 --> 00:39:08,738
but you can't talk to me
like this any more.

210
00:39:11,775 --> 00:39:13,834
This has to end.

211
00:39:13,977 --> 00:39:15,239
Aubrey...!

212
00:39:19,583 --> 00:39:22,450
- Aubrey!
- I love you, Mom. Goodbye.

213
00:40:02,759 --> 00:40:04,624
My sister is dead.

214
00:40:08,465 --> 00:40:10,228
You killed her...

215
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:15,029
just like you killed the others.

216
00:40:19,276 --> 00:40:22,143
You won't stop. Why?

217
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,341
What do you want?

218
00:40:31,688 --> 00:40:32,848
Doug?

219
00:40:38,895 --> 00:40:41,261
Wait... Karen!

220
00:40:44,501 --> 00:40:45,763
Karen?

221
00:40:48,305 --> 00:40:49,670
Karen, no!

222
00:42:01,011 --> 00:42:02,273
Lacey!

223
00:42:05,816 --> 00:42:08,876
Lacey! Lacey!

224
00:42:16,426 --> 00:42:18,587
Lacey! Lacey!

225
00:42:18,729 --> 00:42:21,493
No. no

226
00:42:21,631 --> 00:42:23,394
Lacey!

227
00:42:23,533 --> 00:42:25,296
- No!
- Jake.

228
00:42:44,488 --> 00:42:46,251
It's time for your bath.

229
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:44,940
Karen?

230
00:46:19,302 --> 00:46:24,569
They say this is one of the most
haunted houses...

231
00:46:24,708 --> 00:46:27,609
in all of Japan.

232
00:46:27,744 --> 00:46:29,211
Yeah.

233
00:46:29,346 --> 00:46:32,509
And that anyone who goes
inside gets the curse.

234
00:46:48,965 --> 00:46:51,627
All the other girIs
have been too afraid to try.

235
00:46:51,768 --> 00:46:54,737
Only me and Miyuki
have been able to do it so far.

236
00:47:18,795 --> 00:47:20,057
Help me!

237
00:47:20,997 --> 00:47:23,158
Please, you have to help me!

238
00:47:33,943 --> 00:47:35,501
He killed her.

239
00:47:36,846 --> 00:47:38,814
He snapped her neck.

240
00:47:40,350 --> 00:47:45,219
If you close your eyes
and count to ten...

241
00:47:45,355 --> 00:47:48,518
when you open them again,
you'll see her.

242
00:47:55,665 --> 00:47:59,328
It's all your fauIt!
What did you do?

243
00:48:00,870 --> 00:48:02,735
What did you bring here?

244
00:48:02,872 --> 00:48:08,037
It followed me here.
They followed me here.
