1
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:43,333
Go! Go! Go! Move!

2
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,467
Move!

3
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:53,135
Go!

4
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:38,847
This is yet another liberal attack on our values,

5
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:41,433
our families and on our way of life.

6
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,685
On the subject of gay marriage,
remember this, people.

7
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,897
This is not about the union of
two people of the same sex.

8
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:50,442
This, this is clearly the work of liberal judges

9
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:54,571
who are trying to force their will
on you, the American people.

10
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:56,532
Society at large is better served

11
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:59,660
by maintaining the sacred tradition of marriage.

12
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:04,748
As in a man and a woman joined
together by holy matrimony.

13
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:07,376
The people know it. You know it.

14
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:11,588
And I know it. This is Jim O'Bannon reporting.

15
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:15,217
Good night, everybody, and thanks
for watching The O'Bannon Files.

16
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:06,560
Yeah?

17
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:07,769
Arbor's gone, sir.

18
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:09,438
Missed his assignment in Seattle.

19
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,898
What happened? I'm not sure what happened.

20
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:12,107
He just vanished.

21
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,735
So the guy doesn't complete his assignment,

22
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:17,237
and you have no fucking idea where he is.

23
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:18,655
This is unacceptable.

24
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:20,032
Do you understand?

25
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:22,367
I understand. I'm gonna make it right.

26
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:25,287
I have Senate Oversight all over my ass.

27
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:27,497
And I'm meeting with the director tonight.

28
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,625
The last thing I need is a failed assignment

29
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:32,836
by a rogue agent who disappeared
and didn't follow orders.

30
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:35,881
He is your man. He is your responsibility.

31
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:37,549
Find him and fix it.

32
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,176
Yes, sir. Consider it done.

33
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:21,004
Good morning. How are you?

34
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,714
Good. Excellent.

35
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,831
This is Allan Campbell.

36
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,959
Hello, Allan. Do you know who this is?

37
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,296
Uh... No...

38
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,424
You're forgetting me already, Allan?

39
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,176
Listen, you know,

40
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,344
like I said, I'll...

41
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,804
I'll get you the money.

42
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:12,180
It's just a matter of time.

43
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:15,016
Well, that's great. Can you do it today?

44
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,726
No, no, no. Actually, I have a promotion today.

45
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:18,979
And after that happens, then I got it all covered.

46
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:22,065
The next time I see you, you better have my money.

47
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,985
Yeah, no, I understand. And I appreciate it.

48
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:26,361
Congrats on your career.

49
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,571
Thanks.

50
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:38,790
Oh, shit. Fuck.

51
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,959
Shit. God damn it.

52
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:44,171
You all right?

53
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,547
Huh?

54
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,551
Nicely done.

55
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:53,472
That's a good look. Don't laugh at me, Drew. Come on.

56
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:54,681
What happened to your eye anyway?

57
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:55,891
My eye's fine.

58
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,058
Just let me... Let me have your shirt, please.

59
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,727
What?

60
00:07:58,811 --> 00:07:59,895
Just let me have your shirt.

61
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,062
I'm not gonna give you my shirt.

62
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,189
I can't go in to Gates like this.

63
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:03,356
You shouldn't have spilled coffee on it then.

64
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:04,483
Okay, well, I did.

65
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:05,609
And now I need your shirt, please.

66
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,360
Just... All right. All right.

67
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:11,323
Spill anything on your pants? You
want me to give you those, too?

68
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:13,366
Come on. Stop being like that.

69
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,832
Hey, everybody, I made it. Just kidding.

70
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:24,503
Big day, huh? Everybody pretty excited about it?

71
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:26,421
Hey, Allan made it.

72
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:28,757
Whoa.

73
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:32,177
What

74
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,262
happened with your eye, bud?

75
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,848
Nothing, man. I'm okay.

76
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:37,974
Yeah? Mmm-hmm.

77
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:40,060
I'm fine. Nothing, huh?

78
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:42,479
Doesn't look like nothing to me.

79
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,191
You got a new tie there, huh?

80
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:51,613
Classy. Gray. Didn't know that
was the new power color.

81
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,823
Strong choice. Thanks.

82
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:55,033
Mr. Gates.

83
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:57,494
Okay, fellas, we all have a lot of work to get back to,

84
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:59,579
so I'm gonna keep this snappy.

85
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:03,083
I've looked through all of your proposals.

86
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,252
And while I think all of you have

87
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:07,337
more than a little something to offer,

88
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:10,006
the proposal that hits the nail on the head

89
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:12,050
is the one that shows the most leadership

90
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:14,010
and vision that is gonna be required

91
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,595
to take this company into the future.

92
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:18,431
Congratulations, Felzner.

93
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,643
Thank you, sir. You are welcome.

94
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:24,729
And you can move into that new office
of yours whenever you'd like.

95
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,191
Excuse me, sir? Mr. Gates?

96
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:29,401
Yes, Allan?

97
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:32,237
Listen, you said that you liked my work.
You said that it was strong...

98
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:34,447
I said I liked your work, Allan. And I do.

99
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,157
Okay, so why am I not getting the promotion?

100
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,617
I mean, I've been here longer than Felzner.

101
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:40,287
Felzner is the future, Allan. It's as simple as that.

102
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:43,873
Are you okay?

103
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,292
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

104
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,137
Sorry, bro.

105
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:25,332
Hey, honey, it's me. Call me when you get a chance.

106
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:10,418
Come on. Fuck.

107
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:15,090
Where are you? Shit.

108
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:34,693
Campbell.

109
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,700
Brian, this is Allan.

110
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:43,451
You stole my idea.

111
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,619
And I know it.

112
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,204
And I'm gonna let Gates know it.

113
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:48,206
You can't get away with this. You hear me?

114
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,041
I'm not gonna let you get away with this.

115
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,306
Come on, lady.

116
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:46,014
Hey, honey. I've been trying to call
you. Why didn't you answer?

117
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:52,020
Where's Mike? I saw his car downstairs.

118
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,448
You all right? Something wrong?

119
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:12,540
Hey, Allan.

120
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:23,051
When did you become so detached?

121
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:24,969
What?

122
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,179
I'm gonna go.

123
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:27,847
Please.

124
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:34,312
Jesus, Mike.

125
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,900
I'm sorry.

126
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,165
I wanted you to know.

127
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,252
Hmm.

128
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:58,878
This isn't working, Allan.

129
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:03,800
You are always so distant, so concerned
with climbing the ladder.

130
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,134
For us, Syd.

131
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:07,011
It was always for us.

132
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:09,180
I believe you. I do.

133
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,766
But somewhere along the line,
you actually forgot about me.

134
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:20,817
I mean, look at us. We don't even
fight with passion anymore.

135
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:23,778
The hot and cold I can take, but
this numbness in between...

136
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,031
So does that make this all okay?

137
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,575
No, it doesn't make it okay.

138
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,410
But don't pretend like I'm the only one with secrets.

139
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:32,412
Look at your face.

140
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:34,455
You think I actually believe that was an accident?

141
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,166
No, I just was trying to get ahead, Syd.

142
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,461
That's all I've ever done.

143
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:42,380
Well, maybe trying to get ahead,

144
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:43,798
you just fell behind.

145
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,802
Okay.

146
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:58,771
I'll go... I'll go get a hotel.

147
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:06,362
Allan, wait...

148
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,175
Can I get a J D straight up, please?

149
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:29,218
Big night ahead?

150
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:31,721
Epic.

151
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:38,561
You okay?

152
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,188
Yeah.

153
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:44,567
Thank you.

154
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:53,284
Can I get another one? Preferably in
a bigger glass, if you don't mind.

155
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:55,036
That's the biggest glass I got, sir.

156
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:57,747
I guess I'll be keeping you busy then tonight.

157
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,353
What are you drinking?

158
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,273
Water.

159
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,942
Seriously?

160
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,279
If it was a joke, would it be funny?

161
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:35,159
No, no, I mean, to each his own.

162
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:36,577
We interrupt this game to bring you

163
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:38,621
this breaking news story right now.

164
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:41,833
Jim O'Bannon, host of The O'Bannon files,

165
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:46,337
a sometimes controversial news and
opinion show viewed by millions,

166
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,548
was found dead just minutes ago

167
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:50,550
outside a downtown restaurant.

168
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:51,676
At this time... Barkeep.

169
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,136
...police tell us that apparently

170
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,805
he was shot to death at close range

171
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:58,975
alongside two of his bodyguards.

172
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:02,937
Jim O'Bannon was 58. We now
return you back to the game.

173
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:05,106
So Jim O'Bannon, huh?

174
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:07,859
That's kind of crazy, him getting killed.

175
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,653
Him being a big TV star and all, don't you think?

176
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:13,114
Fame doesn't make you invincible.

177
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,869
Yeah, and I always thought he was a bit of a jackass,

178
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:19,787
but nobody deserves to die, you know.

179
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:36,512
I'm Allan. How you doing?

180
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:40,808
What is this, some kind of fag bar?

181
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,354
No, I was just... I'm sorry.

182
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,484
I was just trying to make some
friendly conversation, that's all.

183
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:54,822
It's like I got "Everlast" stamped across my face, man.

184
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,199
Like a human punching bag.

185
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,160
Can I have another one, please?

186
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:06,834
Thanks.

187
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:17,595
I'm sorry.

188
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,600
Whatever, man. It's cool.

189
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:23,935
When I spoke to you earlier,

190
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,394
I must have given off the impression

191
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,688
that I was game for conversation.

192
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,066
If I wasn't, I should have kept my mouth shut.

193
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:36,697
Name's Jonas.

194
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,575
Allan. Allan Campbell.

195
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:50,128
What you said about being a human punching bag,

196
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,505
you definitely look the part.

197
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:54,423
Yeah, I guess you're right.

198
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:58,928
Corporate world's a bitch.

199
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,222
How'd you know that?

200
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:03,975
I read The Wall Street Journal.

201
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,519
No, I mean how did you know that
I... I work for a corporation?

202
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:07,728
How'd you know that?

203
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:10,064
Doesn't everyone?

204
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:17,572
I'm an engineer.

205
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,699
You like it?

206
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:21,993
Not at the moment, no.

207
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:23,161
Why's that?

208
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:26,205
You ever...

209
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:29,417
You ever have a really, like, a really bad day,

210
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,294
I mean a really fucking bad day?

211
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:35,006
Until recently, no. But recently, yes.

212
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:38,467
Well, my boss, he all but promised me

213
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,761
a promotion and then gave it to the new guy.

214
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,806
I mean, I've been working there for nine years.

215
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:50,771
I mean, I was relying on it. I had... Investments.

216
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:56,861
There's always someone else.

217
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:02,200
Our own expendability, that's all you
can ever really count on in this life.

218
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:04,660
Yeah, tell me about it.

219
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:08,331
Doesn't really explain the eye, though.

220
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:14,212
It's a bit complicated,

221
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,088
to say the least.

222
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:19,550
I guess some investments can really cost you.

223
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:23,846
Yeah.

224
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:30,561
Can you keep them coming, please? Thanks.

225
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:34,690
I've known her for years.

226
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:36,317
Since college.

227
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:40,821
I've known Mike... I met him just before.

228
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,073
And Mike is?

229
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,451
He was my best friend.

230
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:47,161
Your best friend that's fucking your wife?

231
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:51,415
Yeah, well, he's not my... Yeah, yeah.

232
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:53,417
Well, it's okay, then.

233
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:56,837
Yeah, son of a bitch was my best man at our wedding.

234
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:02,426
You know, Allan, what you said before, you were right.

235
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,679
You are a human punching bag.

236
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:09,767
You allow your boss to pass you
over like a Jewish holiday.

237
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:12,812
You obviously allowed someone to
work one over on you pretty good.

238
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:15,398
And you allowed your wife to fuck another guy.

239
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:16,607
I wouldn't say I allowed it.

240
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:19,902
Yes, you did, Allan. You allowed it. All of it.

241
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:22,697
You're the one who said it.

242
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,407
You're so afraid to stand up for yourself

243
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:26,951
no matter what anyone does to you.

244
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:30,079
That makes you a self-perpetuating
victim of circumstance.

245
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:31,205
I'm not looking for any sympathy here.

246
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,415
I just wanted to have some...

247
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:36,919
Shoulder. I get it. Your problem,
Allan, is that you're weak.

248
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:40,589
Your wife sees it. That's why she figures

249
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:42,049
she can sleep with your best friend.

250
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,843
Your best friend, he sees it.

251
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,219
That's why he figures he can wrap legs with her

252
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,595
and not suffer any real consequences.

253
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,930
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

254
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:50,725
I think you're... You're crossing the line a little bit.

255
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:52,059
Okay.

256
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:54,186
Who the hell are you

257
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:57,315
to tell me who I am and who I'm not?

258
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:01,152
As far as I see it, I'm the closest thing

259
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:02,903
to a friend you've ever really had.

260
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:07,992
I mean, we've known each other
for what, two hours? Come on...

261
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:11,287
How long did you know Mike?
Look how that turned out.

262
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,166
I'm your friend, Allan,

263
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,626
because I got the balls to be brutally honest with you.

264
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,130
Complete and total openness,

265
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:22,673
no skipping paragraphs.

266
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,676
Everybody else in your life is full of shit.

267
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:31,932
You know, for somebody who claims
to know so little about people,

268
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,518
you certainly got everything figured out.

269
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:38,147
Hmm?

270
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:41,108
It's part of my job.

271
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:47,156
What's that? You're like a...

272
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:50,451
You a shrink? You shrink heads
for a living? What do you do?

273
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:53,204
I'm a professional killer, Allan.

274
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:01,670
Bullshit.

275
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:03,005
Jim O'Bannon,

276
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,840
that guy we saw on the TV earlier?

277
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,384
Hmm. What about him?

278
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:17,395
Yeah, right.

279
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:23,609
When I said I wasn't much of a people person,

280
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:26,779
I meant I always work alone.

281
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,116
But I always know my opponent.

282
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,118
That's how I can read people so well.

283
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:34,787
Seriously?

284
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:37,415
If it was a joke, would it be funny?

285
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:39,959
Seriously?

286
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:49,176
Okay, fine. Let's say hypothetically,

287
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:54,473
you killed O'Bannon. Why?

288
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:58,644
I was paid to perform a job, but then decided

289
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:01,480
to come here and do O'Bannon instead.

290
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,315
Personal reasons.

291
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:07,403
That's pretty sloppy for a so-called professional.

292
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:09,029
I mean, you come here, you kill O'Bannon,

293
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:14,201
and then you give a tell-all to a complete stranger.

294
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:17,663
But we're not complete strangers,
Allan. We're friends, remember?

295
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:19,623
Here we go.

296
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:24,462
Here, I'll prove it.

297
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:30,926
Write down five names.

298
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:32,219
What?

299
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,513
Pretend you just paid me a considerable
amount of money.

300
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,682
I work for you now.

301
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:39,226
You want five people dead, and you're gonna

302
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:40,603
write their names on that napkin.

303
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:43,022
Okay, come on. Come on.

304
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:45,274
Everybody has names, Allan.

305
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:46,692
Especially you.

306
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:55,367
Okay. I'll play along.

307
00:24:56,536 --> 00:25:00,998
So what, like, what specific order do you want?

308
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:02,208
What do you want?

309
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:07,254
Let's say number five dies first
and then I work my way up.

310
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:09,590
Number one being the priority.

311
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:16,597
Five, okay, so I'll put, five. Okay,
how about... Okay, five.

312
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:20,643
Fred Gates. You know, the boss
that I was telling you about.

313
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:24,438
Okay. Thanks.

314
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,857
Okay, Fred Gates.

315
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:31,195
Number four. Brian Felzner.

316
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,696
The guy that got your promotion.

317
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:34,198
He stole my idea.

318
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:37,826
He did. He stole my idea. He put
his little spin on it, whatever.

319
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:39,745
But he stole my idea, Jonas.

320
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:41,830
And this is the kind of douchebag, let me tell you.

321
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:43,290
I hate people like this.

322
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,334
They drive around in their little
cars, and they have these...

323
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:47,044
You know, the personalized license plates.

324
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:49,129
His says "Feltz" on it.

325
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,800
I mean, he should die just for that reason.

326
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:55,886
Okay, so Brian Felzner. That's number four.

327
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:59,306
Like I said, Allan, I can read you like an open book.

328
00:25:59,432 --> 00:26:00,808
Number three.

329
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,602
You're gonna like this one.

330
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:07,231
Dom Escatdo.

331
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:09,275
Is that a cartoon character?

332
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:13,737
That's the one who, you know,
gave me the bump here.

333
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:15,155
The investment. Yeah.

334
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:17,408
Then his number's definitely up.

335
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,285
Number two.

336
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:24,415
It's a tough one. Mike Dodd.

337
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:27,126
Again, not without just cause.

338
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:29,295
And number one...

339
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:36,844
My sweet little wife.

340
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:39,096
Well, then that bitch definitely got to go.

341
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:47,479
Okay, okay. There you go.

342
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:50,274
There you go.

343
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:55,321
Now you can psychoanalyze me all you want.

344
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:00,826
It's a good list, Allan. No Dr. Phils.

345
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:05,956
I'm gonna take a leak. This is...

346
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:07,625
This is therapeutic. This feels good.

347
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,878
It's too bad you're not the real thing, Jonas.

348
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:32,626
What the hell!

349
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:48,767
As far as I see it, I'm the closest thing

350
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:50,227
to a best friend you've ever had.

351
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:52,479
I just wanted you to know we slept together, Allan.

352
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:53,647
We slept together, Allan.

353
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:57,776
You allowed your wife to fuck another guy.

354
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:58,944
Hey, Allan.

355
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:00,863
You care? You really don't care, do you?

356
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:02,531
Felzner is the future.

357
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:03,824
Congratulations. Thank you, sir.

358
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:05,492
It's as simple as that.

359
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:07,828
Your problem, Allan, is that you're weak.

360
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:08,954
Hey.

361
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:10,205
Yeah, trying to get ahead.

362
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:11,498
Is that the new power color?

363
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:12,708
Trying to get ahead.

364
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:14,168
Strong choice, man.

365
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:16,503
Trying to get ahead, you fell behind.

366
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:18,172
You are a human punching bag.

367
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:20,257
Look at your fucking face. Look at your fucking face.

368
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:22,342
You think I actually believe that's an accident.

369
00:29:22,635 --> 00:29:23,677
I work for you now.

370
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,220
You want five people dead,

371
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:26,638
and you're gonna write their names on that napkin.

372
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:29,349
Fucking your wife. Fucking your
wife. Fucking your wife.

373
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:45,991
Oh, God. Hello?

374
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:47,242
Where are you?

375
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:49,661
Why haven't you called me back?

376
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:53,415
Maybe 'cause I knew it was you, Syd.

377
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:54,875
I've been calling you all night, Allan.

378
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:58,754
I thought maybe with the way your face looked...

379
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:01,548
Why do you care? Why do you care where I've been?

380
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:04,676
I care, and you know that.

381
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:06,970
I just needed...

382
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:08,180
Shit.

383
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:28,242
McKay!

384
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:31,036
Come on, boss. I just got here.

385
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,913
We just got another shooting.

386
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,706
Where? Out by Frankfurt.

387
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:36,917
Weird thing is it looks like it ties into O'Bannon.

388
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:38,502
Oh, yeah? How so?

389
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:40,504
Ballistics matched the slugs we took out of O'Bannon

390
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:42,256
and his bodyguards.

391
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:45,759
They've ID'd them as something
called a 5.7 millimeter.

392
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:47,469
Really?

393
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,304
You know something?

394
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:51,098
The 5.7's only been on the market a few years.

395
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:52,683
It's nasty shit.

396
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:54,726
Super accurate, screaming hot velocity,

397
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:56,520
kind of stuff you find on the battlefield,

398
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:58,522
not in your backyard. That's just great.

399
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:00,190
So tell me more about this new one.

400
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:02,359
Like I said, same MO as before.

401
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:04,862
Only this time it looks like he took his time with it.

402
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:07,573
Crime scene figures after the first shot to the belly,

403
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:09,283
he let him flail around for an hour or so

404
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:11,410
before finishing him off with two more to the head.

405
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:14,621
Okay, so this one's a little more
personal. Who's the vic?

406
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:29,970
Hey, man.

407
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:32,556
What the hell is going on?

408
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,016
You didn't hear?

409
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:35,809
No, Drew. What's going on?

410
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:38,812
Gates, man. He's dead.

411
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:41,481
What?

412
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:43,525
He's dead.

413
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:46,945
The cops are supposed to be by this morning
and ask us all some questions.

414
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:51,283
Number five. My boss, Fred Gates.

415
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:55,537
Have you seen Felzner around?

416
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:57,998
Number four. Brian Felzner.

417
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:00,375
Brian? I don't know.

418
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:03,003
I think he had a meeting over at Victor Rosen's. Why?

419
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:05,839
No, I was just... I was just curious.

420
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:08,634
You okay, man?

421
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:09,843
Hmm?

422
00:32:10,386 --> 00:32:11,511
You don't look so good.

423
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:14,264
No, yeah, no... I'm fine. Will you
put that at my desk, please?

424
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:16,224
I just... I drank a lot last night, Drew.

425
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:25,817
Hey, do you work here?

426
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:28,570
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

427
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:29,780
Detective McKay. Hi.

428
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:31,031
What's your name? Allan Campbell.

429
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:33,116
Hey, Allan. Look, I don't know if you're aware,

430
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:35,202
but your boss was murdered last night.

431
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:36,620
No, yeah, no, I heard. That's...

432
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:39,164
Yeah, someone broke into his house and shot him.

433
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:41,041
What are you guys thinking, a robbery or...

434
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:42,584
Well, you can only be robbed

435
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:44,378
if something gets taken, right? Hmm.

436
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:46,296
Look, I'm here to talk to all the employees,

437
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:47,547
but now that we've already met,

438
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:48,674
why don't I start with you?

439
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:49,883
You know, Detective, if you don't mind,

440
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:51,051
I have a really important meeting

441
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:52,177
that I'm already late for.

442
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:53,345
So if I could come back anytime,

443
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:54,930
I can come back today or...

444
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:57,015
Yeah, yeah, sure.

445
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,600
How about noon?

446
00:32:58,726 --> 00:32:59,810
Does that work for you?

447
00:32:59,894 --> 00:33:01,144
Yeah. Noon's fine.

448
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:04,064
Let me give you this just in case. And...

449
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,525
I hope you don't mind me asking,

450
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:07,651
but where were you last night?

451
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:08,819
Huh?

452
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:10,237
Where... Where were you last night?

453
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:13,115
Oh, at home with my wife. Yeah.

454
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:15,742
Okay? Yeah, I gotta ask.

455
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:16,994
I'll see you back here...

456
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:18,161
Thank you very much. Appreciate it.

457
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:19,830
Hey, you've reached Brian Felzner.

458
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:21,748
Please leave a message, and have a great day.

459
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,750
Hey, Brian. This is Allan Campbell.

460
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:25,419
Will you please give me a call
when you have a chance?

461
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:30,799
Victor Rosen's office.

462
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:32,050
Is Brian Felzner there?

463
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:33,468
Brian Felzner?

464
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:34,594
Yes, the engineer.

465
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:36,638
Oh, right. He's actually with Mr. Rosen.

466
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:37,764
Thanks.

467
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:56,241
Morning, Allan.

468
00:33:57,618 --> 00:33:58,660
Jonas?

469
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:01,997
What the hell are you doing here?

470
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:03,957
Waiting for you, obviously.

471
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:13,258
You killed Gates?

472
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:15,427
You're welcome.

473
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:20,974
Why are you doing this?

474
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:23,894
I'm your friend, remember?

475
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:27,105
Jonas, this is fucking crazy. Stop it, please.

476
00:34:27,982 --> 00:34:33,987
Some people never go crazy. What
truly horrible lives they must lead.

477
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:36,156
I don't want you to do this. Please.

478
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:38,867
How are you planning on stopping me, Allan?

479
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:40,827
By going to the police?

480
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:42,746
Be sure to mention your involvement

481
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,331
as my employer when you do.

482
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:46,500
What! Are you... What!

483
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:48,919
I'm sure there's no legal ramifications

484
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:50,378
for something like that.

485
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:53,799
Listen, God damn it! I was just having a drink,

486
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:55,926
having a conversation, just friendly conversation!

487
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:58,220
I don't... This is a joke! I thought it was a joke!

488
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:00,680
Allan, lower your voice.

489
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:02,432
I don't want people to die!

490
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:05,227
What the hell did you think a hit list was?

491
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:09,272
Okay. Look, fine.

492
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:12,859
Fine, if I'm your employer,

493
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:15,904
then you're fired. Okay?

494
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:17,405
You're fired. That's it.

495
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:18,573
Let's just end this.

496
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:20,367
No can do, Allan.

497
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:23,703
I'm not the kind of guy to turn his back on a friend

498
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:24,955
when he sees that he's sick.

499
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,083
Sick? What the...

500
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:29,709
What are you talking about?

501
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:33,421
You allow the people in your life to walk all over you.

502
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:34,589
That's a sickness.

503
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:37,592
No. They have to learn

504
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:39,928
that there are consequences when they fail you.

505
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:47,227
Number four hasn't been crossed off the list yet.

506
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:50,814
I can't let you do this.

507
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:52,649
Then stop me, Allan.

508
00:35:53,901 --> 00:35:55,068
Stop me.

509
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,016
Come on, Brian. Pick up.

510
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,434
Come on. Come on. Pick up.

511
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:35,984
Shit!

512
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:47,871
Come on. Come on.

513
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:52,417
Would you say he was angry?

514
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:54,961
I wouldn't say he was angry. He
was just really disappointed.

515
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:58,423
McKay.

516
00:36:58,507 --> 00:36:59,966
Detective McKay, this is Allan Campbell.

517
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:01,676
We just met a few minutes ago.

518
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:03,720
You know, it's funny, your buddy Drew, here,

519
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:05,305
and I were actually just talking about you.

520
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:06,556
What?

521
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:09,809
Yeah, you and your boss had some kind
of disagreement yesterday, Allan?

522
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,228
No, no, no, no. Just listen to me.

523
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:13,730
I didn't kill him, okay, but I know who did.

524
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:15,273
Oh, yeah? And who might that be?

525
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:16,608
Look, there was a guy I was drinking with

526
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:17,776
in a bar last night.

527
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:18,985
His name is Jonas.

528
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,153
You gotta trust me, okay?

529
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:21,905
And you're saying this drinking buddy of yours,

530
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:23,323
he was the one who clipped Gates?

531
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:25,533
Yeah! And he's going after Felzner next!

532
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:27,494
Who's Felzner? Brian Felzner!

533
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:28,870
The guy who took my promotion!

534
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:30,080
Your promotion?

535
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:32,082
Listen, God damn it! I don't have time for this!

536
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:33,625
You have to come and meet me! Please.

537
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:34,834
Allan, calm down.

538
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,086
Why don't you come back into the office

539
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:37,337
and we'll take care of that interview already?

540
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:38,463
No, no. You come to me.

541
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:39,839
I'll explain everything to you

542
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:41,091
when I see you, okay? Please.

543
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:42,259
Where are you?

544
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:43,843
The Rosen building. Just please hurry!

545
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:47,889
Shit. Don't go anywhere.

546
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:50,392
This is Detective McKay.

547
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:52,394
I need a unit to meet me over at the Rosen building.

548
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:17,294
Come on.

549
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:44,404
Can I help you?

550
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:45,572
Yeah, I'm looking for Brian Felzner.

551
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:47,282
You called earlier, right? Yeah. Yeah.

552
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:48,491
You just missed him.

553
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:49,826
I did?

554
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:12,474
Hello, there.

555
00:39:48,677 --> 00:39:50,053
Hey, Brian! Brian! Brian.

556
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:51,221
Campbell!

557
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:52,472
What the hell are you doing here?

558
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:53,848
Look, somebody's trying to kill you.

559
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:55,058
What?

560
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:56,684
Please. You have to believe me. Okay, just...

561
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:58,728
If this has something to do with the Gates proposal...

562
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:01,314
Listen, God damn it! It has nothing
to do with that, okay?

563
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:05,151
You know something about what happened to Gates?

564
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:09,948
Yeah, yeah. Yes, I...

565
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:11,991
Look, yeah, yeah, you stay the hell away from me.

566
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:13,159
No, no, no. No, please!

567
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:14,911
No! You stay the fuck away from me! All right, Allan...

568
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,513
No!

569
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:37,851
Time to go, Allan.

570
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:40,019
I'm not going with you. I'm not
going with you anywhere, man.

571
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:41,187
Let's go. Please don't!

572
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:42,439
Let's go. Come on.

573
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:45,692
What did you do... Get in the car!

574
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:48,862
Do you want to be here with Brian?
Get your ass in that car!

575
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:50,613
Do it!

576
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:52,449
Let's go, Allan!

577
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:54,200
Jesus Christ... Get in the car!

578
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:55,577
Open the door!

579
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:57,203
I don't want to open it.

580
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:00,790
Please, Jonas... Get your ass in...

581
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:02,876
Please, Jonas! Please! Get in the fucking car!

582
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,245
Hang on.

583
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:54,928
Shit!

584
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:57,138
Whoa!

585
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:00,433
Stop it!

586
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:13,947
Whoa!

587
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:23,623
Jesus!

588
00:42:39,765 --> 00:42:41,307
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa!

589
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,562
Fuck.

590
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:49,816
No! God!

591
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:35,028
What about our uni? Is he gonna make it?

592
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:39,532
You got a 20 on that black caddy yet?

593
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:41,200
All right, okay, let me know.

594
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:44,329
So, get this, guy goes bananas

595
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:46,664
right out in the open for everyone to see.

596
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:48,833
He flattens Felzner in the Caddy, and then he hops out

597
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:50,877
and he double taps him for good measure.

598
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:52,754
And we're sure that Campbell wasn't the shooter?

599
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:53,963
Not according to witnesses.

600
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:55,340
And we got a building security camera

601
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:56,799
that shows a black male, mid-40s.

602
00:43:57,217 --> 00:43:58,968
Witnesses say he puts a gun up to Campbell's head

603
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:00,803
and he forces him into the car.

604
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:02,013
Campbell mentioned another guy,

605
00:44:02,097 --> 00:44:04,015
somebody he met at a bar last night.

606
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:05,558
Said this guy was the one that clipped Gates.

607
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,519
We traced Campbell's cell phone back to his car.

608
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:10,229
Okay, good. We need to talk to Campbell's wife

609
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:11,856
and anyone else who's seen him the last couple days.

610
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:13,149
I'm on it.

611
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:15,360
This just doesn't make any sense.

612
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:17,487
The shooter, you've seen his shot groupings.

613
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:18,738
He's a pro.

614
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:21,366
Why run him over and make a show of it?

615
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:23,242
It's like he's doing all this just for fun.

616
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:29,666
Let's go.

617
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:35,004
He had a family.

618
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:36,172
He still does.

619
00:44:56,443 --> 00:44:57,944
How can you do that?

620
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:00,655
How can you just kill somebody like that?

621
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:05,785
God doesn't discriminate. I guess
he made me in his own image.

622
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:10,289
Life's a fluke, Allan.

623
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:13,126
A flash in the pan and then it's over.

624
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:17,630
A trigger's like a fast forward button.

625
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:21,008
I just skip to the end credits on other people's lives.

626
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:24,137
Or not.

627
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:26,556
The choice is mine to make.

628
00:45:32,312 --> 00:45:33,479
Where are we going, Jonas?

629
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:35,314
Get in the car.

630
00:45:40,487 --> 00:45:42,155
Number three comes after four.

631
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:51,205
Number three.

632
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:53,666
Dom Escatdo.

633
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:22,028
Ford here.
- Any news?

634
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:23,446
Not yet, sir. Just landed.

635
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:26,199
I know you landed 'cause I can track a goddamn flight.

636
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:27,950
Do we have a 20 on our friend?

637
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:30,703
No, but we have very good reason
to believe he's in the city.

638
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:34,040
So nothing has changed since our last conversation.

639
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:35,792
Do you think he's dead?

640
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:38,085
Possibly, but unlikely.

641
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:42,131
Well, he is a dying man. Maybe he'll
die before you fuck it up again.

642
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:44,425
If he doesn't, it's your ass. Are we clear?

643
00:46:44,551 --> 00:46:45,885
Yes, sir. I'll find him.

644
00:46:50,724 --> 00:46:53,643
Police are pursuing the suspect
who, according to witnesses,

645
00:46:53,727 --> 00:46:55,311
murdered a man by running him over

646
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:56,979
with a car and then shooting him.

647
00:46:57,397 --> 00:47:00,441
The suspect, who you can see here
in this surveillance photo,

648
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:02,819
was seen speeding away from the scene of the crime

649
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:04,862
with a white male in his mid-30s.

650
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:06,656
Ford is taking care of our problem.

651
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:10,243
It's unclear whether that man
is working with the suspect

652
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:11,828
or was taken hostage.

653
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:15,414
Did we get a hit from his cell? Okay.

654
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:18,793
Any Internet activity? Okay.

655
00:47:19,294 --> 00:47:21,254
Check the local hotels and rental car agencies

656
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:23,339
using every known alias.

657
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:27,426
It's a small town. How hard can it be to find him?

658
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:29,512
Local law enforcement's on him.

659
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:32,807
I'm headed downtown to meet
with the lieutenant in charge.

660
00:47:54,454 --> 00:47:56,205
Will you please tell me what's going on?

661
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:57,957
Just a precaution.

662
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:02,044
Just get in the car and we'll explain
down at the station. Okay?

663
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:13,139
I've told you everything I know.

664
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:14,515
Yeah, you did.

665
00:48:14,641 --> 00:48:16,225
Except that everything you've been telling us

666
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:19,061
is inconsistent with what's been developing.

667
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:22,815
Your husband's boss was murdered
last night. Did you know that?

668
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:25,484
No, I didn't.

669
00:48:26,486 --> 00:48:29,363
A couple hours ago Brian Felzner was also killed.

670
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:30,990
Does that name sound familiar to you?

671
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:33,159
No.

672
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:36,287
He's one of your husband's co-workers, Mrs. Campbell.

673
00:48:36,371 --> 00:48:38,581
He's the one who got the promotion.

674
00:48:38,665 --> 00:48:42,335
You're aware that Allan didn't get the promotion, right?

675
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:43,586
Yes.

676
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:46,380
So in light of all of this, you're still claiming

677
00:48:46,506 --> 00:48:49,216
that your husband was with you the whole night?

678
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:53,095
I'm sorry, I can't hear you.

679
00:48:53,513 --> 00:48:54,680
Yes.

680
00:48:55,557 --> 00:48:56,849
He was.

681
00:48:57,017 --> 00:48:59,602
What are your husband's thoughts
on Jim O'Bannon, Mrs. Campbell?

682
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:01,395
What?

683
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:03,189
I'm sorry,

684
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:05,358
are you suggesting Allan had
something to do with that?

685
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:07,944
Yeah, that's what we're trying to figure out.

686
00:49:08,695 --> 00:49:10,613
You ever seen this man before, Mrs. Campbell?

687
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:16,077
Just from this photo from the
news. But besides that, no.

688
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:17,244
You've never seen him before?

689
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:19,080
You have absolutely no idea who he is?

690
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:20,748
No. I don't. Then why in the hell

691
00:49:20,874 --> 00:49:21,958
was your husband in the car with him

692
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:23,125
when he killed one of my men?

693
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:25,461
I don't know! Look, I don't know
what the hell is going on!

694
00:49:25,545 --> 00:49:26,921
But trust me, Allan would never

695
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:28,381
have gotten involved with something like this.

696
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:30,049
He couldn't have.

697
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:32,259
And yet, strangely enough, he does have motive

698
00:49:32,427 --> 00:49:33,970
for at least two of these victims.

699
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:36,639
Okay. What about any disputes he may have had?

700
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:39,976
Aside from the one with his boss and Brian Felzner.

701
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:41,560
Any enemies, maybe?

702
00:49:42,604 --> 00:49:44,355
No, just because he didn't get a promotion at work

703
00:49:44,439 --> 00:49:46,565
does not make these people his enemies, Detective.

704
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:47,733
Not necessarily, no.

705
00:49:47,901 --> 00:49:51,320
But it doesn't make them his
friends now, either, does it?

706
00:49:51,446 --> 00:49:52,989
What about his eye? How'd that happen?

707
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:56,450
I don't know.

708
00:49:57,411 --> 00:49:58,744
You don't know?

709
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:04,917
I'm sorry, Mrs. Campbell, but he's your husband.

710
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:07,169
I mean, I'm not a married guy,

711
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:08,921
so maybe I'm speaking out of turn here.

712
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:10,631
But I'd like to think that if I was

713
00:50:10,757 --> 00:50:12,675
and I came home looking like
I'd been decked in the face

714
00:50:12,759 --> 00:50:14,969
that maybe my wife would at least inquire

715
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:16,345
as to how the hell it happened.

716
00:50:16,763 --> 00:50:19,306
Look, he just said it was an accident.

717
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:21,142
And I trust him.
- And that's it?

718
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:22,351
Yes.

719
00:50:22,811 --> 00:50:25,271
You just left it at that? No further questions?

720
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:26,814
Yes.

721
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:29,900
You and your husband having any
problems lately, Mrs. Campbell?

722
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:31,277
Trouble at home? I'm sorry.

723
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:33,029
What... What does that have to do with anything?

724
00:50:33,488 --> 00:50:35,614
Hmm. It's just a question.

725
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:37,950
Everybody has problems.

726
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:42,121
Yeah.

727
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:12,026
Here we are, Allan.

728
00:51:16,823 --> 00:51:18,157
Jonas,

729
00:51:19,201 --> 00:51:20,326
this is the one guy

730
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:21,702
on the list I don't care about.

731
00:51:23,663 --> 00:51:25,915
I mean, look what he did to my eye.

732
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:02,368
What's the story with you and that cartoon, anyway?

733
00:52:05,413 --> 00:52:08,207
You don't seem like the degenerate type.

734
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:13,254
A friend of mine at work told me about
a fix. Said it was a sure thing.

735
00:52:13,421 --> 00:52:16,382
Aside from death, there is no sure thing, my friend.

736
00:52:17,217 --> 00:52:19,218
I promise you that shit.

737
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:38,320
We ain't open yet.

738
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:41,907
Let's get out of here.

739
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:44,076
I was wondering if I could talk to Dom.

740
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:46,203
And what the fuck do you want to see him for?

741
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:48,747
Tell him it's Allan Campbell regarding
the money he owes him.

742
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:07,933
I'm telling you, all right. You gotta come down here.

743
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:10,603
No, we got the place gutted. It still needs a lot of work.

744
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:15,357
But your money's being well spent. Trust me.

745
00:53:15,483 --> 00:53:16,567
When we're through with this place,

746
00:53:16,651 --> 00:53:19,486
it's gonna be the hottest fucking
nightclub in town. All right?

747
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:20,654
Yes.

748
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:25,201
I think these guys want to see
you about a little bit of money.

749
00:53:28,496 --> 00:53:30,372
I gotta call you back.

750
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:35,002
I remember you.

751
00:53:35,503 --> 00:53:37,004
Your eye looks good.

752
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:39,590
You got my money already?

753
00:53:39,674 --> 00:53:41,508
No. I... No.

754
00:53:42,135 --> 00:53:43,219
Hmm.

755
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:45,137
Then what the fuck are you doing here?

756
00:53:46,139 --> 00:53:49,975
What did I say to you the first and
last time we spoke? Hmm?

757
00:53:51,144 --> 00:53:54,396
You have two weeks and the next time I see you

758
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:56,649
you better have my fucking money.

759
00:53:56,733 --> 00:54:02,404
Mr. Escatdo, I'm afraid Allan has
given you all that he has to give.

760
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:05,741
What are you, his lawyer?

761
00:54:05,825 --> 00:54:08,035
Who the hell are you? What the
fuck are you even doing here?

762
00:54:08,161 --> 00:54:09,203
I'm his friend.

763
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:13,499
His friend? Is this some kind of fucking joke?

764
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:15,876
If it was, would it be funny?

765
00:54:21,841 --> 00:54:23,342
So let me get this straight.

766
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:26,303
You bring this Shaft wannabe in here

767
00:54:26,388 --> 00:54:30,516
to intimidate me out of the money you owe me?

768
00:54:31,017 --> 00:54:33,102
Does that sound about right? Some shit like that?

769
00:54:33,186 --> 00:54:34,353
Yeah.

770
00:54:34,562 --> 00:54:37,064
Do you even know who the fuck I am?

771
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:41,193
Mr. Escatdo, Allan is not a gambling man.

772
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:44,029
He had a lapse in judgment.

773
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:45,906
Made a mistake.

774
00:54:46,032 --> 00:54:47,074
And I'm pretty sure

775
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:50,369
he had every intention of paying you
back once he got his promotion.

776
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:54,206
Oh. So what, I'm supposed to
just cut my losses? Is that it?

777
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:56,292
That would be greatly appreciated.

778
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,377
Listen, you little piece of shit.

779
00:54:59,212 --> 00:55:01,922
I'm not afraid of this sly motherfucker here!

780
00:55:02,048 --> 00:55:05,759
But if you do not get me my money,
I will fucking smoke you

781
00:55:06,261 --> 00:55:08,053
and everyone who's ever fucking known you!

782
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:10,806
And when I say everyone, I mean every fucking body!

783
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:12,433
You...

784
00:55:16,771 --> 00:55:18,063
Fuck you!

785
00:55:23,069 --> 00:55:24,111
Fuck.

786
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:29,408
Whoa, whoa. No, no, no.

787
00:55:29,492 --> 00:55:31,076
Come. No, no, no.

788
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:34,079
Jesus Christ.

789
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:39,668
Shoot him. What?

790
00:55:40,503 --> 00:55:41,628
Shoot him, Allan.

791
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:43,297
What are you doing? Hey, come on.

792
00:55:44,257 --> 00:55:46,133
Shoot him, Allan. No, no, no.

793
00:55:46,259 --> 00:55:49,094
You don't owe me anything. All
right? The debt's cleared.

794
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:50,262
You said it.

795
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:51,972
You don't care what happens to him, right?

796
00:55:52,932 --> 00:55:54,600
Isn't that what you said to me?

797
00:55:56,978 --> 00:55:58,270
You think I'm fucking stupid?

798
00:55:58,355 --> 00:55:59,438
No.

799
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:01,648
No. What was your plan?

800
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:03,692
I don't have... You put Dom and I in a room together

801
00:56:03,777 --> 00:56:05,235
and then we just wipe each other out?

802
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:06,362
Was that it? Seriously?

803
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:07,613
I'm sorry.

804
00:56:07,655 --> 00:56:08,864
No. Hey. Please don't make me a part of this.

805
00:56:08,948 --> 00:56:10,074
I don't want to be a part...

806
00:56:10,158 --> 00:56:11,533
You are a part of it, Allan.

807
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:13,786
Whether you like it or not, you're a part of this.

808
00:56:14,287 --> 00:56:15,329
God.

809
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:16,872
The part you play is up to you.

810
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:18,707
Shoot him.

811
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:20,000
Don't! Don't listen to him!

812
00:56:20,126 --> 00:56:22,044
I will fucking pay you! I will pay you!

813
00:56:22,128 --> 00:56:23,212
Anything you want, all right.

814
00:56:23,296 --> 00:56:24,338
Anything you want!

815
00:56:25,131 --> 00:56:27,007
Anything! Shoot him, Allan!

816
00:56:27,133 --> 00:56:28,175
Don't listen to him!

817
00:56:28,301 --> 00:56:29,343
Don't you fucking listen to him!

818
00:56:29,803 --> 00:56:32,471
Do it. Allan, do it. Please! Please don't!

819
00:56:33,473 --> 00:56:34,890
Do it! Do it! I don't want to!

820
00:56:34,974 --> 00:56:36,558
Shoot him, Allan! Don't fucking kill me!

821
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:37,726
Shoot him, you fucking pussy!

822
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:39,311
Shoot him! Please don't!

823
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:41,230
See, I'm not like you! No!

824
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:42,564
Fuck!

825
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:53,325
Fuck. You motherfucker.

826
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:55,744
Oh, now you're showing initiative?

827
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:01,250
I like it, Allan.

828
00:57:02,669 --> 00:57:03,710
Yes.

829
00:57:04,671 --> 00:57:06,672
Do it. Shoot me.

830
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:09,091
I'm not a killer.

831
00:57:09,175 --> 00:57:10,509
Neither was I once.

832
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:13,345
But you'll get there.

833
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:19,852
Unless you physically stop me, this list gets completed.

834
00:57:20,353 --> 00:57:21,437
No. Yes.

835
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:26,024
We work our way up. Number one is still the priority.

836
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:28,068
No! You don't hurt her! You hear me?

837
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:30,237
God, no!

838
00:57:50,925 --> 00:57:52,342
Hey! Hey! Hey!

839
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:54,595
Stop! Stop! He's inside!

840
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:55,929
He's inside! Drop the gun!

841
00:57:56,055 --> 00:57:58,390
Drop the gun right now! Drop the
gun! He's in there! He just shot...

842
00:57:58,892 --> 00:58:00,392
Drop the gun right now! Face away from me!

843
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:02,102
Listen to me! He's right fucking there.

844
00:58:02,228 --> 00:58:05,230
Drop the gun! Face away from
me! Face away from me!

845
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:06,940
He just killed some people!

846
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:08,358
- God damn it!
- Get down on your knees!

847
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:09,902
Okay. Get down on your knees!

848
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:11,069
Get down! Get down! Get down!

849
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:12,237
All right!

850
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:13,489
You gotta believe me! He's right there!

851
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:14,823
Hands out to the side!

852
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:16,575
He's right inside! Hands out to the side!

853
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:18,285
Stay right there! Get your hands out to the side!

854
00:58:19,454 --> 00:58:21,079
Bring your other hand back!

855
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:23,499
Sir, listen to me! He's inside!

856
00:58:38,306 --> 00:58:41,808
Why don't you open the goddamn
door! Where are you?

857
00:58:43,937 --> 00:58:48,357
Son of a bitch! Where the fuck are you?

858
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:55,614
Please, you need to help me find my wife. You...

859
00:58:55,698 --> 00:58:57,157
Settle down. Settle down, hotrod.

860
00:58:57,283 --> 00:58:58,659
We need to find my wife, you hear...

861
00:58:58,785 --> 00:58:59,868
She's fine.

862
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:01,787
She's upstairs. She's fine.

863
00:59:01,871 --> 00:59:02,955
She what?

864
00:59:03,289 --> 00:59:04,706
Take a seat.

865
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:07,209
We picked her up after your little incident downtown.

866
00:59:07,293 --> 00:59:09,545
I figured, with the body count you're
leaving in your wake today,

867
00:59:09,963 --> 00:59:11,547
keeping her with us was a pretty safe bet.

868
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:15,425
What's your relationship to Mike Dodd?

869
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:16,969
He's a friend of mine. Listen, he's in trouble.

870
00:59:17,053 --> 00:59:19,638
Okay, you need to find him. He's
number two on the list. All right?

871
00:59:19,722 --> 00:59:21,139
You mean this list?

872
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:22,683
Jesus.

873
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:26,353
Don't worry, I'm sending a car
over to pick him up. Sit down.

874
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:28,480
Hmm? Sit down!

875
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:36,905
Now what the fuck is going on here, Campbell?

876
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:41,243
You got ties to at least two of these
vics and possibly a third.

877
00:59:41,327 --> 00:59:43,870
I got one dead cop and you at the scene waving a gun.

878
00:59:43,997 --> 00:59:45,247
Listen, I tried to tell you...

879
00:59:45,331 --> 00:59:46,582
No, you told me a joke.

880
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:49,418
Two guys walk into a bar. Fucking hilarious.

881
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:52,337
The shooter, Campbell.

882
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:53,672
Who is he?

883
00:59:55,174 --> 00:59:56,341
His name is Jonas.

884
00:59:56,801 --> 00:59:57,884
You got a last name?

885
00:59:58,011 --> 00:59:59,803
No. I... I don't know.

886
01:00:04,475 --> 01:00:06,059
Well, how the hell do you fit into all this?

887
01:00:06,185 --> 01:00:09,896
Because if I'm perfectly honest, from where I stand,

888
01:00:10,023 --> 01:00:12,899
you could very much look like an accessory.

889
01:00:14,027 --> 01:00:17,988
Okay, I told you I went into a bar last
night, and I wanted to have a few...

890
01:00:18,072 --> 01:00:19,865
No, no, no. You told me that you were at home

891
01:00:19,991 --> 01:00:21,033
with your wife last night.

892
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:22,534
And so did she.

893
01:00:24,662 --> 01:00:26,163
She said that?

894
01:00:27,248 --> 01:00:30,292
You better start cutting me a clue here, Campbell.

895
01:00:30,376 --> 01:00:32,044
What's your relationship to this Jonas?

896
01:00:32,337 --> 01:00:35,213
There is no relationship. Okay?

897
01:00:35,506 --> 01:00:37,716
Please just trust me. All right?

898
01:00:37,842 --> 01:00:40,927
I went into a bar. I got a little drunk.
I wanted to talk to somebody.

899
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:44,848
I thought all this was... It was just a joke.

900
01:00:44,932 --> 01:00:48,435
Then I woke up in the morning
in my car. I went into work

901
01:00:48,561 --> 01:00:50,187
and I found out that Gates was dead.

902
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:53,649
Now if you don't get to Mike Dodd

903
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:55,108
before he does,

904
01:00:55,234 --> 01:00:56,735
he's gonna be dead, too.

905
01:01:36,275 --> 01:01:37,693
I've heard some crazy shit in my time,

906
01:01:37,777 --> 01:01:40,237
but that's got to be about up there
with the goddamn craziest.

907
01:01:41,239 --> 01:01:42,823
I don't know, I think I believe him.

908
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:44,116
Seriously?

909
01:01:44,784 --> 01:01:45,826
Yeah, look at this guy.

910
01:01:45,952 --> 01:01:46,952
He's in way over his head.

911
01:01:47,078 --> 01:01:48,120
His record's squeaky clean.

912
01:01:48,246 --> 01:01:51,581
He hadn't had so much as a parking ticket in six years.

913
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:54,668
He doesn't have that level of crazy in him.

914
01:01:54,794 --> 01:01:56,586
Well, we're not sure of anything right now.

915
01:01:56,963 --> 01:01:59,423
And until we are, he stays here.

916
01:02:00,299 --> 01:02:01,842
How about Dodd?

917
01:02:02,135 --> 01:02:04,469
Unit's on its way to pick him up.

918
01:02:20,778 --> 01:02:22,696
We're here to see Mike Dodd.

919
01:02:25,825 --> 01:02:31,830
Come on. Jesus Christ. Come on.

920
01:02:46,846 --> 01:02:50,348
What the hell? Excuse me?

921
01:02:51,976 --> 01:02:53,185
What is going on here?

922
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:00,525
Are you Mike Dodd?

923
01:03:00,651 --> 01:03:01,985
Yes, I am.

924
01:03:02,069 --> 01:03:04,362
Do you know an Allan Campbell, sir?

925
01:03:04,489 --> 01:03:05,614
Yes, I do.

926
01:03:05,698 --> 01:03:06,865
Detective said somebody would be coming by

927
01:03:06,991 --> 01:03:07,991
to explain something to me.

928
01:03:08,075 --> 01:03:09,117
What's going on?

929
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:11,369
Well, apparently, he broke in here looking for you.

930
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:14,164
I'm afraid you're gonna have to come with me.

931
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:16,166
For your own protection, sir.

932
01:03:17,668 --> 01:03:20,837
This is just great. Oh, my God.

933
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:44,277
I've been so worried.

934
01:03:48,032 --> 01:03:49,074
I'm sorry, Allan.

935
01:03:50,785 --> 01:03:53,078
You slept with my best friend.

936
01:03:54,747 --> 01:03:56,081
And you want me dead for it.

937
01:03:57,708 --> 01:03:58,750
No.

938
01:04:02,964 --> 01:04:05,298
Oh, man, I didn't mean for any of this...

939
01:04:07,301 --> 01:04:09,094
Why do you think Mike was there, Allan?

940
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:12,764
What's wrong?

941
01:04:13,808 --> 01:04:15,100
I can't do this.

942
01:04:22,441 --> 01:04:23,984
This was a mistake, Mike.

943
01:04:24,986 --> 01:04:27,112
Allan, we never slept together.

944
01:04:28,281 --> 01:04:29,406
What?

945
01:04:31,993 --> 01:04:33,910
I feel like you left our marriage,

946
01:04:33,995 --> 01:04:36,496
and you've been so distant for so long.

947
01:04:37,999 --> 01:04:43,461
I just... I wanted you to find me with Mike.

948
01:04:47,008 --> 01:04:50,135
I wanted to know that I still mattered to you.

949
01:04:51,512 --> 01:04:54,431
What I did was a mistake, and I'm so sorry.

950
01:04:56,976 --> 01:05:00,478
Yeah. Me, too.

951
01:05:10,865 --> 01:05:11,948
Man.

952
01:05:14,201 --> 01:05:15,785
Those people, Syd,

953
01:05:17,163 --> 01:05:19,456
those people are dead because of me.

954
01:05:19,832 --> 01:05:20,874
No.

955
01:05:22,293 --> 01:05:23,793
No, if this guy hadn't found you,

956
01:05:23,878 --> 01:05:25,378
he would have met somebody else.

957
01:05:26,172 --> 01:05:27,881
But I did meet him.

958
01:05:29,342 --> 01:05:31,509
And I wrote those names down.

959
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:35,889
No. Come here.

960
01:05:43,814 --> 01:05:45,899
What do you think he wants?

961
01:05:48,527 --> 01:05:50,487
He wants me to kill him.

962
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:14,010
Can I help you?

963
01:06:14,095 --> 01:06:15,387
Lieutenant Harp?

964
01:06:15,763 --> 01:06:17,138
That's right.

965
01:06:17,223 --> 01:06:18,556
Special Agent Ford.

966
01:06:18,724 --> 01:06:22,102
My agents and I are here to help
solve your little problem.

967
01:06:22,228 --> 01:06:23,478
What's this about?

968
01:06:23,562 --> 01:06:25,855
We're here regarding Jonas Arbor.

969
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:27,190
Whatever information you attain

970
01:06:27,274 --> 01:06:30,443
on the whereabouts of him must
be shared with us immediately.

971
01:06:30,569 --> 01:06:32,445
Then we'll take it from there. Just like that?

972
01:06:34,448 --> 01:06:37,450
You have no idea who you're dealing with here.

973
01:06:37,576 --> 01:06:42,247
You go after a man like Arbor, and
it ends only one way. Bad.

974
01:06:42,790 --> 01:06:44,791
This is a direct order, Lieutenant.

975
01:06:44,917 --> 01:06:47,752
Yeah, can I talk to you guys for a second?

976
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:00,306
You wanted me to check on Mike Dodd's ETA?

977
01:07:00,433 --> 01:07:01,641
Yeah. We can't reach the cops

978
01:07:01,767 --> 01:07:04,394
we sent to pick him up. They won't respond.

979
01:07:04,478 --> 01:07:07,939
It's got to be Jonas. What about the spooks?

980
01:07:08,315 --> 01:07:10,442
We'll keep them entertained.

981
01:07:13,446 --> 01:07:14,988
Jonas works for the US government?

982
01:07:15,489 --> 01:07:18,283
Did. Now he's just an embarrassment to them

983
01:07:18,409 --> 01:07:20,452
with a little too much press coverage.

984
01:07:20,578 --> 01:07:22,078
That's the reason these guys are here.

985
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:25,248
So the same guys that created him
now want to take him down.

986
01:07:25,332 --> 01:07:27,083
Look, I'm not thrilled about the way it is, either.

987
01:07:27,168 --> 01:07:29,127
But it is what it is.

988
01:07:46,103 --> 01:07:48,438
I think they're looking for us.

989
01:07:48,647 --> 01:07:53,777
Please stop now.

990
01:07:53,861 --> 01:07:58,031
No can do, Mike. We got a schedule to keep.

991
01:08:00,701 --> 01:08:05,163
Why are you doing this?

992
01:08:08,626 --> 01:08:09,834
I saw a friend in need.

993
01:08:11,837 --> 01:08:13,129
Please!

994
01:08:15,382 --> 01:08:19,511
There are penalties to be paid
for our indiscretions, Mike.

995
01:08:21,305 --> 01:08:22,514
Allan?

996
01:08:24,517 --> 01:08:27,143
You've been a very bad boy, Mikey.

997
01:08:28,312 --> 01:08:29,896
Nothing happened!

998
01:08:31,398 --> 01:08:35,318
Sydney, it was a mistake!

999
01:08:35,986 --> 01:08:38,571
It's really too late for all of that.

1000
01:08:39,824 --> 01:08:44,869
Please. Please. I need a doctor.

1001
01:08:49,333 --> 01:08:53,169
Some people are beyond saving. Trust me on this one.

1002
01:09:03,556 --> 01:09:04,889
Detective?

1003
01:09:07,226 --> 01:09:08,351
Oh!

1004
01:09:09,895 --> 01:09:12,772
Son of a bitch. He's headed to the station.

1005
01:10:00,779 --> 01:10:03,114
Look at this guy. What the fuck?

1006
01:10:19,924 --> 01:10:21,633
Dispatch, this is Detective McKay.

1007
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:23,801
Son of a bitch stole a police uniform.

1008
01:10:23,928 --> 01:10:25,637
I think he's headed your way.

1009
01:11:01,674 --> 01:11:02,674
What the hell was that?

1010
01:11:03,509 --> 01:11:04,801
It's him.

1011
01:11:09,223 --> 01:11:10,348
Code red. Code red.

1012
01:11:10,474 --> 01:11:11,933
All available to Metro Police Station.

1013
01:11:12,017 --> 01:11:13,059
All units respond.

1014
01:11:14,478 --> 01:11:15,895
Hey, get out of the goddamn way!

1015
01:11:22,027 --> 01:11:23,152
He went down...

1016
01:11:29,201 --> 01:11:30,868
Come on. Come on.

1017
01:11:36,709 --> 01:11:39,544
Watch them. If things go bad, take them out the back.

1018
01:11:40,504 --> 01:11:43,673
Evacuate all non-essential personnel immediately.

1019
01:11:49,513 --> 01:11:50,972
Hello, Jonas.

1020
01:11:51,724 --> 01:11:52,849
Ford.

1021
01:11:53,559 --> 01:11:56,144
You vanished like a puff of smoke in Seattle.

1022
01:11:56,895 --> 01:11:58,813
Just left us hanging.

1023
01:12:00,816 --> 01:12:04,986
So, what, the doc gave you the
news and you just snapped?

1024
01:12:08,032 --> 01:12:10,074
Realized you're not a God?

1025
01:12:10,826 --> 01:12:12,535
I stopped having any fun.

1026
01:12:14,663 --> 01:12:16,164
Then I met Allan.

1027
01:12:16,248 --> 01:12:19,250
You figured you'd go out with a bang. Is that it?

1028
01:12:19,376 --> 01:12:20,752
Whatever it takes.

1029
01:12:24,757 --> 01:12:29,260
I don't have to tell you what a liability you've become.

1030
01:12:29,386 --> 01:12:31,012
I played my part.

1031
01:12:31,847 --> 01:12:34,432
And all I was left with in the end is this dreaded cough.

1032
01:12:36,226 --> 01:12:39,687
And they say depleted uranium doesn't kill.

1033
01:12:39,897 --> 01:12:42,690
Well, I'm here to speed that up for you.

1034
01:12:44,109 --> 01:12:47,779
I've come to terms with my own mortality, my friend.

1035
01:12:48,113 --> 01:12:50,698
All that's left is to finish what I started.

1036
01:12:51,116 --> 01:12:53,117
We all die with food on our plate.

1037
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:55,453
What's on yours?

1038
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:34,492
McKay.

1039
01:13:34,576 --> 01:13:36,661
SWAT's on the way, boss. Just hold him off.

1040
01:13:39,164 --> 01:13:40,289
What are you doing?

1041
01:13:54,763 --> 01:13:55,847
He's coming for me, isn't he?

1042
01:13:56,682 --> 01:13:58,516
All right, people, you all know what to do.

1043
01:14:02,521 --> 01:14:05,022
Taylor, check the hallway. Williams, watch him.

1044
01:14:23,542 --> 01:14:26,043
Cease fire! Cease fire! God damn it!

1045
01:14:34,887 --> 01:14:36,053
Down!

1046
01:15:10,547 --> 01:15:11,589
You son of a bitch!

1047
01:15:27,397 --> 01:15:28,439
Go. Get out.

1048
01:15:35,447 --> 01:15:36,864
Let's go. Come on.

1049
01:16:12,651 --> 01:16:13,818
Shit.

1050
01:16:27,791 --> 01:16:29,000
Freeze!

1051
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:52,356
Oh! Fuck me. Come on. We gotta get in there.

1052
01:17:13,879 --> 01:17:15,046
Shit.

1053
01:17:53,251 --> 01:17:54,919
Attaboy, Allan.

1054
01:18:05,430 --> 01:18:06,597
God, no!

1055
01:18:09,101 --> 01:18:11,686
It's up to you how this ends, Allan!

1056
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:36,627
Sydney.

1057
01:18:37,754 --> 01:18:39,630
I see you.

1058
01:18:44,302 --> 01:18:46,262
Shit. How do we get out?

1059
01:18:52,978 --> 01:18:54,145
Allan.

1060
01:18:56,565 --> 01:19:02,486
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1061
01:19:08,952 --> 01:19:10,661
Sydney.

1062
01:19:10,996 --> 01:19:12,163
Jesus.

1063
01:19:12,497 --> 01:19:16,250
Sydney. I can't do it. I can't keep running.

1064
01:19:25,594 --> 01:19:27,011
There you are. Okay.

1065
01:19:29,347 --> 01:19:31,974
Okay. You're okay, honey. Listen...

1066
01:19:33,977 --> 01:19:35,519
Clear! Move up!

1067
01:19:38,857 --> 01:19:41,525
All right. You're fine. That's right.

1068
01:19:43,528 --> 01:19:45,613
Okay, that's all right.

1069
01:19:45,947 --> 01:19:47,615
What are we doing?

1070
01:19:48,867 --> 01:19:50,785
What are we doing, Allan?

1071
01:19:50,869 --> 01:19:52,495
He's not gonna stop, Sydney.

1072
01:19:52,704 --> 01:19:54,205
He's not gonna stop until he kills you.

1073
01:20:20,398 --> 01:20:21,690
Come on. Keep it moving.

1074
01:20:33,411 --> 01:20:34,578
Allan.

1075
01:20:37,082 --> 01:20:39,250
Only you can end this, Allan.

1076
01:20:43,255 --> 01:20:45,589
You can't hide from me, Allan.

1077
01:20:47,092 --> 01:20:48,759
This is what I do.

1078
01:20:55,016 --> 01:20:56,767
Sydney.

1079
01:20:58,270 --> 01:20:59,770
Whoo!

1080
01:21:00,981 --> 01:21:02,857
Sydney.

1081
01:21:04,484 --> 01:21:07,236
Where are you?

1082
01:21:10,782 --> 01:21:12,408
There you are.

1083
01:21:23,795 --> 01:21:26,463
You're number one in my book, Syd.

1084
01:22:03,710 --> 01:22:05,836
A trigger's like a fast forward button.

1085
01:22:06,838 --> 01:22:09,673
I just skip to the end credits on other people's lives.

1086
01:22:11,635 --> 01:22:12,843
Or not.

1087
01:22:13,303 --> 01:22:14,929
The choice is mine to make.

1088
01:22:15,847 --> 01:22:17,973
I knew you had it in you.

1089
01:22:38,078 --> 01:22:39,161
Don't move!

1090
01:22:39,245 --> 01:22:40,913
Nobody move! Let me see your hands!

1091
01:22:40,997 --> 01:22:45,876
Get down! Get down!

1092
01:22:46,711 --> 01:22:49,171
Stand down! Stand down!

1093
01:24:09,711 --> 01:24:11,003
I can't let you do this.

1094
01:24:11,087 --> 01:24:12,421
Then stop me, Allan.

1095
01:24:12,797 --> 01:24:13,881
Stop me.

1096
01:24:18,428 --> 01:24:19,845
The hostage situation

1097
01:24:19,929 --> 01:24:22,222
at the police station in Spokane, Washington,

1098
01:24:22,307 --> 01:24:23,891
ended early this morning

1099
01:24:23,975 --> 01:24:28,353
when Metro SWAT engaged and
killed the suspect, Jonas Arbor.

1100
01:24:28,772 --> 01:24:30,981
Arbor's hostages, Allan and Sydney Campbell,

1101
01:24:31,066 --> 01:24:34,276
suffered non-life-threatening
injuries during their ordeal

1102
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:36,987
and are now safely recovering at a local hospital.

1103
01:24:37,655 --> 01:24:41,366
It could be several days until the full death
toll from the rampage is known.

1104
01:24:42,285 --> 01:24:45,287
At this time, 18 deaths have been reported.

1105
01:24:45,371 --> 01:24:47,998
Three of the bodies are still unidentified.

1106
01:24:48,583 --> 01:24:51,960
It's now believed Campbell is innocent
of any criminal involvement with Arbor

1107
01:24:52,170 --> 01:24:56,090
and was simply an unwilling participant
in Arbor's deadly game.
