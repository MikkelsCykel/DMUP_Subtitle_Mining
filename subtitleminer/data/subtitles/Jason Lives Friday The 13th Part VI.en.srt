00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,200
I don't know how
you talked me into this, Tommy.

2
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,500
Hell, I must be crazy!

3
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:05,900
You know, if the institution
ever found out about this,

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,300
they'd haul our butts
back in in straitjackets, permanent!

5
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,900
You didn't have to come, Hawes.
This is between me and Jason.

6
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,500
I know.
I still don't get the therapy here.

7
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,500
All you need to know
is Jason's dead, right?

8
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:25,000
Seeing his corpse
won't stop the hallucinations.

9
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,800
Seeing it won't,
but destroying it will.

10
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,900
Jason belongs in hell,
and I'm gonna see he gets there.

11
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,600
OK, there it is.

12
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,200
There's his grave.

13
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,400
- OK, let's go.
- Wait a second.

14
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,500
- What?
- I got to be sure.

15
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:39,000
There's your proof.
There's his coffin. Let's go.

16
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:44,600
- Hand me the crowbar.
- You're not gonna open that.

17
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,800
Hand me the crowbar.

18
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,700
I got it.

19
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,600
I really don't like this.

20
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,200
Die!

21
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,400
- Die!
- Tommy!

22
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,800
Tommy, get the hell out of here!

23
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,300
Where are you going?

24
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,300
What's that for?
Tommy, what are you doing?

25
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,900
Shit.

26
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:34,000
Die, die! Bastard! Die!

27
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,200
Oh, boy. He must have
really messed you over.

28
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,300
Yeah, fuck you, Jason.

29
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,900
What are you doing?

30
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,100
Tommy! Would you just
leave that thing alone?

31
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,000
Please!

32
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:06,900
Tommy, please, let's get out of here.
My heart can't take any more!

33
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:24,100
- Don't shoot! Please!
- Are you in show business?

34
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,400
- You know how to make an entrance.
- You got to do something.

35
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:32,800
- Jason's alive. He's coming for me.
- You almost got your head blown off.

36
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,200
- Listen, damn it!
- Don't piss me off, junior.

37
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:41,800
Jason is alive. We dug up his body.
I was going to cremate it.

38
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,400
Hold it. What's your name, son?

39
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,100
Tommy Jarvis.
He's even more powerful now...

40
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,700
Didn't that maniac
kill your mother and friends?

41
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:54,800
- Jason murdered them.
- You were in a psychiatric clinic.

42
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,200
What's going on with the weather?!
Sorry. I didn't know...

43
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:03,700
No problem, Rick. This is Tommy, a
former resident. He's got some prank.

44
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,500
There's no time for this bullshit!
Jason's got to be stopped!

45
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:13,500
"That's known as ""screwing the pooch"".
Iron this punk."

46
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,800
You got to listen to me!
Jason's coming. He's after me!

47
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,200
I tried to destroy him
but I fucked up!

48
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,800
- You got that right.
- Listen to me.

49
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I'm sorry about your folks,

50
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:28,600
but no one in Forest Green
wants to remember that maniac.

51
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,200
That's why we changed the name. They
wanna forget this was Crystal Lake.

52
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,800
They don't need you
stirrin' up Jason shit.

53
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,400
Now just lie down and get some rest.
Tomorrow I'll call that clinic.

54
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,700
Go to the cemetery.
You'll see I'm not lying.

55
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,800
Get some sleep,
or I'll come in and put you out.

56
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,300
You'll be sorry you didn't listen.

57
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,700
You'll be sorry if you don't shut up.

58
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:53,100
Take a nap, junior!

59
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,000
Easy! It's hard enough
to read this thing.

60
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,100
Who said to take this cow path?

61
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:22,300
"You admit the sign did say
""Camp Forest Green"""

62
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,600
with an arrow pointing this way?

63
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,900
I admit nothing without my lawyer.
We should have left a trail.

64
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,900
Don't start.

65
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,500
So much for the head counselors
getting back to camp on their own.

66
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,600
Let's get out and start
screaming for help.

67
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:44,200
- I was just kidding, Lizbeth.
- Darren, we better turn around.

68
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,900
- Why?
- I've seen enough horror movies

69
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,900
to know any weirdo in a mask
is never friendly.

70
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:05,600
There's no way. If the car drops in
that gully, we'll never get it out.

71
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,900
Do you have a better suggestion?

72
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,600
Yeah. We're gonna scare him.

73
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,600
- We're going to scare him?
- Drive towards him. He'll move.

74
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,400
- Nobody wants to die.
- Least of all us!

75
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,600
Will you just drive?
He'll get out of our way.

76
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,800
Yeah, that really scared the shit
out of him!

77
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,800
Oh, no.

78
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:51,500
- We're driving back in reverse.
- The hell we are.

79
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,300
- Where did you get that?
- Don't worry about it. Stay cool.

80
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,500
Stay cool? You ain't Dirty Harry!
Stop it.

81
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:11,000
All right, scumbag.
Get out of the road.

82
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,300
Now!

83
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,400
Get back in now. He'll kill you.

84
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,400
Not if I get him first.

85
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,200
Please! Give me a second!

86
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,000
Please!

87
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:58,100
Please! You can have the...

88
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:43,400
Dad, you could at least drive out
to Cunningham Road and look for them.

89
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:48,000
Megan, we don't have time to look for
camp counselors with car trouble.

90
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,500
Can't you put out
an all points bulletin?

91
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:55,600
- Can your mother sew, kid?
- Excuse me?

92
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:58,800
- Off.
- Sorry.

93
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:04,800
Darren and my sister Lizbeth
are organizing the new campgrounds.

94
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
- We don't know what to do.
- And the kiddies arrive today.

95
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,800
I sympathize with you kids.

96
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:15,500
I'll tell the station in Carpenter
to look out for them.

97
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,000
I've got a bad feeling about it.

98
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,900
Hopefully they're fine,
but with Jason out there...

99
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,500
- Shut up.
- Jason who?

100
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:26,000
Megan, stay away. He's dangerous!

101
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,600
I'm not dangerous.
Jason is out there.

102
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,900
He's looking for me.
He's probably gone to the camp.

103
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,500
- I said shut up!
- You mean the Jason of Camp Blood?

104
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,800
- Yes!
- No! You kids better leave.

105
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:43,400
This boy is not well.
I need to talk to him in private.

106
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,600
- Come on, Dad!
- Megan! Go back to camp.

107
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:50,000
- I'll call you if I hear anything.
- Don't beat him up too bad.

108
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,600
- He's kinda cute.
- Megan, leave!

109
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,600
He's cute!

110
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,500
I was gonna call that clinic
to collect you,

111
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:14,500
but I don't want you around poisoning
people with your warped humor.

112
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,300
They have to be warned, Sheriff.

113
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:22,100
Jason will return to what's familiar.
It's still camp Crystal Lake to him.

114
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,900
We'll escort you
to the edge of my jurisdiction.

115
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:31,500
Then we'll say goodbye and never see
you around here again. Understand?

116
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,100
Shit! Shit, damn!
I know I'll get blamed for this.

117
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,100
They'll say old Martin
ain't a good caretaker.

118
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:54,300
I'm a damn high school graduate.
I deserve this job. I earned it.

119
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,700
Nobody's gonna find out.

120
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,100
Shitheads couldn't
even stick him back in right.

121
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,000
I ain't gonna touch the slimy sucker.

122
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,100
Why did they have
to go and dig up Jason?

123
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,300
Some folks have a strange idea
of entertainment.

124
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,700
- Anything else?
- You guys, I'm getting worried.

125
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:32,400
- About Jason?
- No. About Darren and Lizbeth.

126
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:36,000
They should've at least called,
don't you think? Megan?

127
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,000
- What?
- Hello?

128
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:44,600
This girl's back in the jail cell
with her prisoner of love.

129
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:48,500
Don't mess with no jailbird, girl.
Those dudes are bad news.

130
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:52,400
- And how do you know?
- I seen plenty on TV.

131
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,100
- TV?
- Yeah!

132
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,600
I don't know about that guy, Megan.

133
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,500
He seemed weird
with all that Jason stuff.

134
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,900
Megan, like I told you,
you need a guy like me.

135
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:09,000
- Guy who's not twisted.
- Maybe he was telling the truth.

136
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,000
Just because our parents
say Jason was only a legend,

137
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,100
doesn't mean it wasn't true.

138
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,600
What if he did come back here,

139
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:22,900
looking for the camp counselor
that caused him to drown as a boy?

140
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,800
Searching for the one
that decapitated his vengeful mother.

141
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:34,500
And you know what
today's date is, don't you?

142
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:40,000
I can think of only one thing
even more terrifying.

143
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,500
What?

144
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,300
The kids are here.

145
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:58,100
You'll trip.
Be careful. You may fall.

146
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,500
There they are and they're all yours.

147
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,200
Think I'd rather deal with old Jason.

148
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,900
Crap.

149
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,900
Once we nail Roy, that's it.
Victory is ours.

150
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,400
It's taking forever. I'm starving.

151
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:44,100
Larry, that's why your sales
are always behind quota.

152
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:47,500
Your instinct to eat is
stronger than your instinct to win.

153
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,800
- You're a real ass!
- Better than being all ass!

154
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,400
That is so unfair!

155
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,400
Here we go with unfair again.
War is not fair.

156
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,400
Give me a break.
This is not war, this is a game.

157
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:04,500
- I want a sandwich.
- Wait till we've killed something.

158
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:08,800
- Easy! You're an insurance salesman.
- Death is my business.

159
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,200
You become another person
when we're out here, Stan.

160
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,200
- I don't like it.
- This is a man's game.

161
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:18,300
It requires a man's cunning
and intelligence...

162
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,700
With a woman's touch.

163
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,100
Wait a minute!
I thought Burt shot you!

164
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,200
See any paint?

165
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:32,800
Sorry, guys, I did in Mr. Commando,
weapons and all.

166
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:36,300
Survival's the name of the game
and that flag is mine.

167
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,700
I can't believe this.
Burt never gets shot.

168
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:45,800
- Never should have let her play.
- She's a damn company exec!

169
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:50,300
Now, boys. Don't be spoilsports.
Put on your headbands.

170
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:08,500
Dumb broad! She tricked me!
They're gonna laugh for months!

171
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,600
She should have stayed
in the kitchen!

172
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,300
A woman shouldn't be allowed
in these games!

173
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,500
It's not a game, it's life!

174
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,600
Jason really screwed up
that poor son of a bitch's mind.

175
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:45,500
He really believes that
Jason's still alive, doesn't he?

176
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:49,400
What worries me is how far he'll go
to try and prove it.

177
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,100
Darn.

178
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,300
Oh, no.

179
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,700
Oh, my God! No!

180
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,800
Where... Come on!

181
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,300
Where? Oh, no!

182
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,600
Oh, no! Oh, God!

183
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:52,300
Come on out, you guys.
The game's over.

184
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,800
What about Roy? Nobody's seen him.

185
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,100
Unless he's accidentally pelleted
himself, I'm sure he's lost.

186
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,000
- It's not over till it's over.
- Right.

187
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,800
Wait a second. What was that?

188
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,900
- What?
- Nothing.

189
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,000
I could swear I heard something.

190
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,000
- I'm hungry.
- Be quiet.

191
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:41,900
Oh, my God! My God!

192
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,000
Help, guys! Help me!

193
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,900
Help! Oh, no!

194
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:52,200
Help me, guys! Help! Oh, God!

195
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:59,000
Help me! Somebody help me!

196
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,300
He's gonna kill me!

197
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,900
Eternal Peace Cemetery.
1 MILE.

198
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,300
What did I tell you?
Hit the noise and the cherries.

199
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:26,400
- Sheriff, wait! You gotta listen!
- I'm tired of listening to you.

200
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:31,600
- I gotta show you Jason's grave!
- Come on! Get up! Get up!

201
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,800
Please. You'll see we dug it up.

202
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:38,600
He must have got chilly
and pulled the dirt back over.

203
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:42,400
That's not right.
Somebody covered it over.

204
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,200
- I gotta see it!
- Freeze it, psycho.

205
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,700
Now see, you made my deputy
draw his revolver.

206
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,800
He's been dying to try
his new laser scope.

207
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,600
Wherever the red dot goes...

208
00:26:55,800 --> 00:27:00,000
- What's the problem, Sheriff?
- No problem. It's under control.

209
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,100
- Did you cover up Jason's grave?
- What?!

210
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,700
Don't concern yourself, Martin.

211
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:09,800
Jason's not in his grave, Hawes is!
You've gotta dig it up!

212
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,000
You've gotta dig it up!

213
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:24,100
Dig him up?
Does he think I'm a farthead?

214
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,300
OK! Is this gonna be
the best weekend ever?

215
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,100
Are we gonna go fishing?

216
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:39,200
Are we going to scare all the boys?

217
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,200
Are we going to...

218
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,700
Are we going to
not eat Brussels sprouts?

219
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,600
What happened to Cort?

220
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:55,100
Are you ready? He's teaching
the young men my favorite sport.

221
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:58,300
- Which is?
- Boy scouting, honey.

222
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,900
Cort? You've got to be kidding?

223
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,500
You've got to be kidding.

224
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:06,900
You obviously don't know anything
about Indians. None of you do.

225
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,700
These are called Indian markers.

226
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:14,200
You have a chief, right,
and he dumps his squaw or whatever.

227
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,400
He decides to pick another woman
and take off.

228
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,900
So he leaves his son with the mother.

229
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,200
Later, the son wants to find his dad

230
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,000
to learn how to kill buffalo,
or whatever.

231
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,200
So he comes along, sees the rocks.
Sees his dad went that way.

232
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:34,700
So he knocks them all down
so his mother won't know where to go.

233
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,300
So that's the basic story.
Tells you where they go.

234
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:42,400
If this is as exciting as it gets,
we're in big trouble.

235
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,400
Let's go.

236
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:59,700
Like the sign says,
you are now leaving Forest Green.

237
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:03,900
You are damn lucky, kid!
With the grief you've given me,

238
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,900
you should be wearing your balls
as earrings.

239
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,700
If I see you again,
you can guarantee it.

240
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,500
Let's get the hell out of here, Rick.

241
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:46,200
Steven, it's beautiful.

242
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,900
God, I love it. I really do.

243
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:54,500
I don't know.
I mean, I'm sort of hurt.

244
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:58,300
You thought I brought you
up here just to... Never mind.

245
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,200
Yeah. Well, I guess I do owe you.

246
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:07,200
Yeah. No, look. I have a headache.
I've been working out. I'm sore.

247
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,800
- And...
- Forget about it.

248
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:12,800
It's a messy act and...
What the heck?

249
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,800
Great!

250
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:25,800
Where did the road go?
I can't find the road.

251
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,200
Where is the road?

252
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,500
Kathleen, you led me astray.

253
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,700
What's that? What's that?

254
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,700
Darling, you're gonna be
the death of me.

255
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,500
Yeah, but what a way to go.

256
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,600
- Stay here.
- No, Steven. Please.

257
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,700
- Stay here!
- Steven, don't!

258
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:49,600
- Steven, what's going on?
- Annette, let's go! Never mind!

259
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:58,000
- What are we gonna do?
- Get the sheriff!

260
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,800
- Pick a card.
- I don't wanna play any more, Sissy.

261
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:46,000
- Come on, pick a card!
- I really don't.

262
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:51,200
OK. I've got a great game.
It's called Camp Blood.

263
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,800
Great.

264
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:57,100
First you take this jack of spades,
which is Jason.

265
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,100
Then you have face cards
which represent counselors.

266
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:05,000
The queen of hearts is me.
Who do you want to be?

267
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:09,200
- Come on, Sissy.
- OK. You be the queen of diamonds.

268
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:13,000
Now, you shuffle Jason up
in these cards here,

269
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:17,400
and you put them in piles.
The piles represent cabins.

270
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:23,000
The object of the game is to find out
which cabin Jason is in.

271
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,400
Did Megan say when she's coming back?

272
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:30,200
Of course not. I bet she took him
a loaf of bread with a saw in it.

273
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,800
I'll call her.

274
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,800
Her dad may know something
about Darren and Lizbeth.

275
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:41,800
I say if they're not here tomorrow,
we send the kids home. We're not...

276
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,600
- She saw a monster!
- Who did?

277
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,400
- It's OK. We're here.
- Yeah, we're here.

278
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,900
What happened?

279
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,100
There was this monster and he was
after me. He wanted to kill me.

280
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,200
- Where?
- He was everywhere.

281
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:21,700
- You mean you had a bad dream?
- No! It was real, just like on TV.

282
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,500
Listen, sweetie. What's your name?

283
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:28,400
- Nancy.
- Well, Nancy. I'm Paula, remember?

284
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,700
And this is Sissy.

285
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,800
We'll be right out there all night
so nothing can hurt you, OK?

286
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:39,600
So no more bad dreams
can come around here.

287
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:43,100
Good. OK, lay down.

288
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,600
There. OK?

289
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:59,400
Wait a minute. Where's Cort?
I haven't seen him for hours.

290
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:02,300
I don't know.
He called somebody and just took off.

291
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,700
Mentioned checking out things
that go bump in the night.

292
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:17,900
You're the best! The best!

293
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,700
Keep it up till the end of this song.

294
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:31,200
- How much longer?
- It's only ten more minutes.

295
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:11,500
Fuck! Wait a second.

296
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,600
- Cort, you didn't already?
- Wasn't that the end of the song?

297
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:18,900
Great. Just great!

298
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,100
If this is burned out,
Horace will have my butt.

299
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,200
Who's Horace?

300
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,300
My stepfather and asshole
in residence.

301
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:39,700
- How did that happen?
- What?

302
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,500
- Plug the cord back in.
- Who unplugged it?

303
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:49,100
- I don't know. Just do it!
- It's cold out there!

304
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,200
I don't give a shit! Go do it.

305
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:56,500
You're a real pain in the ass.
A major pain in the ass.

306
00:36:56,600 --> 00:37:00,500
Hurry. I have to get this back
before Horace finds out I took it.

307
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:02,700
Hurry up!

308
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,400
- Will you come on?
- All right!

309
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,400
I'm going! I'm going, OK?

310
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,500
Shut the hell up.

311
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,100
What are you doing?

312
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,700
- Look at this.
- What happened to it?

313
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,200
I don't know, but unless you
wanna look like it, we go right now!

314
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,300
Nikki, somebody's out there.

315
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,800
- What if it's that Jason?
- I don't want to know.

316
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:41,200
- No way. This isn't happening.
- You're right. It isn't.

317
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:47,700
- Are you gonna drive or not?
- Outta here!

318
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:54,200
Shit! Damn it, Cort!

319
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,400
Shit!

320
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,800
Go!

321
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:10,500
Shit! Cort!

322
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,700
This baby jams!
For a big truck, it's not bad at all.

323
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,300
- Pull over! I'm driving!
- No way. I wanna rock!

324
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,300
This is great!

325
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:34,200
I've never driven a house before.
I like this. This is great.

326
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:51,800
Sounds like you're having fun.
Need some company?

327
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,800
That sounds great.
Do you need some company or what?

328
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:09,000
This is great.
I'm having such a good time.

329
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,100
This is great.

330
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:23,300
Nikki, what are you doing,
taking a dump?

331
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:29,000
Can I come back and snatch a peek?
Or vice versa?

332
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:52,800
Nikki, listen to this.

333
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,500
What makes you so high and mighty?

334
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:36,000
"- Remember, I'm the parent...
- ""And you're the child."""

335
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:38,800
- Right.
- Stop treating me like one.

336
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:41,100
Stop acting like one.

337
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:43,300
Tommy Jarvis is a very sick boy.

338
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:46,100
How do you know?
Did you take his temperature?

339
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,300
Watch that smart-mouthing, lady.

340
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,800
If your mother were still alive...

341
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,700
That's it. Out. I don't need this
tonight. Out, Megan.

342
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:01,200
Sheriff's office.
He can't come to the phone now.

343
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:04,900
He's in the can draining his lizard.
May I take a message?

344
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,500
Here he comes. Please hold.

345
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,500
- It's Rick.
- What? What kind of problem?

346
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:16,200
You better get down here. I found
what's left of those counselors.

347
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,500
Looks like someone did them in
using Jason's old MO.

348
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:23,500
I knew I should have done something
about that son of...

349
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,600
Where are you?

350
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:30,100
- All right, I'm on my way.
- What is it?

351
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:33,900
Seems your boyfriend wants people
to believe Jason's back.

352
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:38,500
- I thought Jason was just a legend.
- Tommy wants to prove it's true.

353
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:42,100
You stay put and I'm not kidding.

354
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,800
30 YEARS AMOGN THE DEAD.

355
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:05,100
THE DEAD ARE  ALIVE!

356
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,200
A MANUAL OF OCCULTISM.

357
00:43:56,500 --> 00:44:00,600
Sheriff's office. Sorry, he's not in.
Can I take a message?

358
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,700
Hi! This is his daughter Megan.
I met you this morning.

359
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:08,000
Yeah, hi. Let me talk
to your dad about Jason.

360
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:11,200
I've got a plan.
First, I need some supplies...

361
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,400
My father's looking for you.

362
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:16,700
Something happened
and he's sure you're responsible.

363
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:20,200
- If he finds you, he'll...
- Yeah. He made that clear.

364
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:24,600
Jason is out there. He's headed
back to the camp. He's gonna...

365
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,500
- Where are you? I'll pick you up.
- What?

366
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:32,000
If my father sees you in your car,
he'll nail you. Where are you?

367
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:35,600
Karloff's General something...

368
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:39,100
I know just where it is.
I'll see you in a half-hour.

369
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:28,300
OK, lift it.

370
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:35,600
Alert all officers and stations in a
50-mile radius about this wacko kid.

371
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:38,300
- Yes, sir.
- I want roadblocks.

372
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:41,500
- Sheriff, get over here!
- Shit! Now what?

373
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,700
Come on.

374
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,900
Mike! Over here.

375
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:56,000
- That all you found?
- I wish it was.

376
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:10,300
I'll order up some body bags.

377
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:13,500
Our boy sure wants us
to believe his story.

378
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:16,800
He picked the right day
to pull this shit.

379
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,900
- What do you mean?
- Happy Friday the 13th.

380
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,400
MEN at PLAY.

381
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:14,800
- All right, who's out there?
- What's going on?

382
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,600
I think I hear somebody
fooling around out there.

383
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:25,800
It's got to be Cort.

384
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:30,100
You know how he loves to try
and scare us. Teach him a lesson.

385
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:45,100
You guys, try not to wake the kids.

386
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,400
I need your car.
You can't come, it's too dangerous.

387
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:08,100
Leaving that truck in plain sight
is dangerous! Hide it and let's go.

388
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:12,700
This isn't a game. You're not coming.
I'm already responsible for...

389
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:15,700
- You said you needed some supplies.
- Yes, but...

390
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:20,100
Then let's get going. Tell me what
you need, I'll see that you get it.

391
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:24,300
And nobody drives this puppy but me.
Hide the heap and let's book.

392
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:04,900
- Can't this tub go any faster?
- You got it.

393
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:09,000
- Just watch for roadblocks.
- OK. There's one.

394
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:18,200
Get down!

395
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,800
Officer Pappas to Sheriff Garris,
do you copy?

396
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:43,600
I'm here.

397
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:47,300
We got a different vehicle
that took off when they saw us.

398
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:50,400
- Got a description?
- The whole enchilada.

399
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:54,500
It's a '77 orange Camaro.
License number Mary, William 8510.

400
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,200
That's my daughter's car.

401
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:03,200
- How do you want us to proceed, sir?
- With extreme care, asshole.

402
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:06,100
If that kid is with her,
he might do something crazy.

403
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,100
Don't do anything crazy.

404
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:22,100
I know what I'm doing.
I got you your supplies.

405
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:33,600
If I reach Cunningham Road,
I can lose them. Stay down!

406
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,900
Whatever you say.

407
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:46,700
That's what I want.

408
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:51,500
It's gonna be a hairy turn. Hang on.

409
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:06,600
Megan, step out of the car.

410
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,400
End of the line.

411
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:14,000
Oh, shit.

412
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:55,300
Paula, I can't sleep. I'm scared.
I saw someone at my window.

413
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:58,500
- Where did you get this?
- I found it outside.

414
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:03,600
You know what?
Sissy and Cort are playing jokes.

415
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:07,900
- You know, scaring each other?
- Why?

416
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,400
Grown-ups think it's funny
to be scared.

417
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:13,100
- What?
- Never mind.

418
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,800
I can't believe it's that late.

419
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,500
- No one called. I better...
- Who are you calling?

420
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:26,800
Why don't we go find Sissy and Cort
first? Then you can go to bed.

421
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:32,100
- Wait. What if they try to scare us?
- We'll scare them right back!

422
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:40,600
Let's find 'em.

423
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:57,500
- I said shut up!
- He's only asking you to look!

424
00:53:57,700 --> 00:53:59,700
You got me where you want me...

425
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:03,400
If I did, they'd pump your ass
full of formaldehyde.

426
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:07,800
- At least call the camp.
- We have. The phone's disconnected.

427
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,500
- That means something!
- They should pay the bill.

428
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:17,000
Just sit tight, Jason.
When the authorities...

429
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:19,500
Sheriff, you better take this.

430
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:23,300
Sheriff Garris.

431
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:27,900
What time?

432
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:31,100
I'll be right there.

433
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:37,900
- What's happened?
- Rick.

434
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:42,600
Keep an eye on this wacko.
Be back as soon as I can.

435
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:46,700
- What's going on?
- Make sure my daughter stays put.

436
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:50,200
- Tell me!
- They just found Cort and some girl.

437
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:54,200
Her head was crushed. Cort had
a knife rammed through his skull.

438
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:59,700
Tommy Jarvis
is a psychopathic killer.

439
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:03,900
- He wants you to believe...
- It was Jason!

440
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,700
- Sheriff, when did it happen?
- For God's sake, Meggie.

441
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:10,100
Stay away from him, please.

442
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:13,400
- When did this happen?
- Why?

443
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:16,300
- What time?
- Eight thirty, nine. Why?

444
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:19,300
Tommy was with me all that time, Dad.

445
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:31,800
Rick, I'll call you from there.
Lock him up.

446
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:41,100
OK, Flash, into the cage!

447
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:57,400
I'm sure Sissy and Cort are back
in their cabins by now,

448
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:00,200
so go back to sleep and don't worry.

449
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:02,300
But what if I get scared again?

450
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,000
You know what I used to do
when I was little and got scared?

451
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,100
I would close my eyes
and say a little prayer.

452
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:15,400
And you know what? Pretty soon,
everything scary went away.

453
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:20,100
It worked for me.
I bet it'll work for you, too.

454
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:22,500
- Good night.
- Good night.

455
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:26,200
See you in the morning.

456
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:19,500
- So what are you drawing?
- So what's it to you?

457
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:23,700
- Pipe down, Jarvis.
- I was curious about her drawing.

458
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:27,400
There. You happy?

459
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:31,900
- Why?
- Because it stinks.

460
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:42,600
- OK, give it back.
- Come and get it.

461
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:45,300
I'll get it for you, babe.

462
01:00:47,700 --> 01:00:50,400
- Come and get it.
- Give it back, punk!

463
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:12,300
Get your hands off her, animal.

464
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:15,500
You little turd.
I ought to punch you silly.

465
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:18,600
Let him out of there, Rick.

466
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:22,700
Megan! Don't clown around.

467
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:27,700
I'm not the one with the funny red
nose. Open the cell and let him out.

468
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:31,900
- Meggie.
- I'm not kidding.

469
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,400
You better do as she says,
because wherever the red dot goes...

470
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:48,800
You son of a bitch!

471
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:07,000
You're really screwing up here,
missy. Don't do this, Megan!

472
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:16,500
- I thought he took your key.
- He did. But I've got my hide-a-key.

473
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:18,700
Not this time.

474
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:22,900
I appreciate your help,
but I have to finish what I started.

475
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:35,800
Come on, hot lips, let's go.
You drive, I'll navigate.

476
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:57,900
Let me know before we blast into
hyperspace. I'll fasten my seat belt.

477
01:02:58,100 --> 01:03:01,000
I got a bad feeling
we're already too late.

478
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:08,800
Is this gonna work? Why don't
we bring the gun and blow him away?

479
01:03:08,900 --> 01:03:13,000
We can only stop Jason by returning
him to his original resting place,

480
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:16,900
- where he drowned in 1957.
- Lake Forest Green.

481
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:21,300
Crystal Lake,
where this nightmare began.

482
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:33,100
Now I lay me down to sleep,
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

483
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:37,100
If I should die before I wake,
I pray the Lord my soul to take.

484
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:57,100
- What's the story here?
- Why don't you nose around?

485
01:04:57,300 --> 01:04:59,800
I'll tell Megan's friends
what happened.

486
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:02,100
- Holler if you see anything.
- Like what?

487
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:05,600
Anything that don't belong.
Don't wake the kids.

488
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:11,200
Come on, handsome.

489
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,600
Girls?

490
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
It's Sheriff Garris.

491
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:46,100
Oh, my God.

492
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:04,100
All right, come on out of there.

493
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:15,700
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

494
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:19,500
Come on out of there.

495
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:44,400
What are you doing out here?

496
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:48,100
- Go on back to bed.
- No! No! There's a scary man!

497
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:50,400
What scary man?

498
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:16,700
No, no. It's OK. It's OK.

499
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:20,400
Everything's all right.
Everything's OK, honey. It's OK.

500
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:31,000
Come on, boys, let's go.

501
01:08:38,700 --> 01:08:40,700
Come on, kids. Come on.

502
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:46,300
Listen to me very carefully.
I want you all to lie under the beds.

503
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:50,800
Do not get up until I come back, OK?
Now, move! Hurry! Come on.

504
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:54,300
Come on.

505
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,600
Fuck!

506
01:10:49,700 --> 01:10:52,300
- See? They did show up.
- Yeah.

507
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:55,800
We'll have to take... Megan, wait!

508
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:09,200
Oh, God! Dad! Daddy!

509
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:28,500
It's OK. It's Megan. Don't be afraid.
Everything's gonna be all right.

510
01:11:28,700 --> 01:11:30,500
Don't be afraid.

511
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,900
- Is everyone OK?
- Fine.

512
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:37,100
It's OK. Everything's
going to be just fine, OK?

513
01:12:13,300 --> 01:12:17,900
I'll find my daddy, the sheriff,
then we can all go home, OK?

514
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:21,500
Now, lie down where you were before
and stay there.

515
01:12:21,700 --> 01:12:24,700
Go ahead.
We'll come back and get you.

516
01:12:25,700 --> 01:12:27,900
I promise. Lie down. Stay there.

517
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:31,200
- What do you think?
- I think we're dead meat.

518
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:38,400
Daddy!

519
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:44,500
Dad, answer me! Dad, where are you?

520
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:49,700
Megan, use your dad's radio
to call for help and an ambulance.

521
01:13:05,900 --> 01:13:07,800
Daddy, where are you?

522
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:13,000
Daddy, please come help us!

523
01:13:19,700 --> 01:13:21,500
Real dead meat.

524
01:13:22,100 --> 01:13:25,400
So, what were you gonna be
when you grew up?

525
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:28,600
Daddy, where are you?

526
01:13:30,700 --> 01:13:33,500
Daddy, please help us. Please!

527
01:13:39,700 --> 01:13:41,900
No! Not her!

528
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:09,600
Dad! Dad, answer me!

529
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:19,700
You've got to help me find my dad.
We need his help.

530
01:14:19,900 --> 01:14:21,700
Hand me the padlock.

531
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:25,900
- Aren't you listening?
- Yes! Hand me the padlock!

532
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:30,300
- Here! You're going to be sorry.
- I hope not.

533
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:54,500
Megan! Get back to the cabin
with the kids.

534
01:14:54,700 --> 01:14:57,300
- Megan, please!
- Wait! You can't do this!

535
01:14:57,500 --> 01:14:59,400
Go before it's too late!

536
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:28,400
Jason! Jason, come on!

537
01:15:29,700 --> 01:15:32,700
Come and get me!
It's me you want, remember?

538
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:47,300
That's it! Come on, maggot head!
Come on, maggot head!

539
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:49,700
That's it. Come on!

540
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:05,800
Tommy! Get out of there! Hurry!

541
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:12,000
Asshole! It's me you want,
remember! Come on!

542
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:15,300
Come on, chicken shit!
I'm standing here waiting!

543
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:17,400
Come on, you pussy!

544
01:19:55,300 --> 01:19:57,300
Is he killed?

545
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:02,500
Stay here.

546
01:22:44,100 --> 01:22:46,300
It's over.

547
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:48,400
It's finally over.

548
01:22:49,900 --> 01:22:51,900
Jason's home.
