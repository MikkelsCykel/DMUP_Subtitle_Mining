1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
AUTOPSY (2008)

2
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:47,606
She's totally sober saying that, I swear.

3
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,739
I swear. Totally sober.

4
00:00:49,816 --> 00:00:51,807
- Time to cut.
- Not!

5
00:01:26,953 --> 00:01:28,007
so much fun.

6
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:29,852
- Are you videoing this?
- This is the best trip ever.

7
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,015
Can I have a kiss?

8
00:01:58,485 --> 00:01:59,952
All right, here we are... Mardi Gras.

9
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:01,714
When is it?
I don't know when it is.

10
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,517
But we're in Mardi Gras.
It's fuckin' awesome.

11
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:32,846
Who is this kid?

12
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:34,750
- Hey, Russia, I'll introduce you.
- Russia.

13
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,311
- Meet my new buddy, the Russian.
- Russia!

14
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,117
Damitri? Damitri.

15
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:41,319
- Dmitri. Hey.
- Dmitri.

16
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:44,921
Dmitri's over here studyin',
but he's going to jump in a car with us,

17
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,693
and we're gonna take him over to Jack's.

18
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:38,981
Anybody hurt?

19
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,816
I don't know.
I was just driving.

20
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,220
Baby, you all right?
You sure you're not hurt anywhere?

21
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,224
Oh, my God, look at my car!

22
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:49,261
Look at this.
It's a fuckin' mess.

23
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:51,797
Does anybody have a working phone?

24
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:53,092
It doesn't matter.
There's no signal.

25
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,293
How in the hell are we gonna
get outta here?

26
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:57,858
I'm with you. Relax.

27
00:03:57,937 --> 00:03:59,234
Oh, you're cut.

28
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:00,932
It's nothing.
Just a little glass hit me.

29
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:02,565
Look at the state
of this fucking thing, huh?

30
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:04,075
- Look at the window.
- It's gonna be okay.

31
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:06,543
- You were lucky.
- Just take it easy.

32
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:07,807
So damn lucky, man.

33
00:04:09,148 --> 00:04:10,809
Don't cry.

34
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:12,783
I gotta take a piss.

35
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,612
Jude, come on, man.
Move on.

36
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:17,815
You're not even together anymore.

37
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,357
Movin' on.

38
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,416
He's frickin' welcome to her.

39
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:38,868
Jesus Christ!

40
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,945
Motherfucker! Fuck!

41
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:44,005
What is it?

42
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:47,114
- You hit him.
- That's impossible.

43
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:48,983
I didn't see him.
Did you guys see him?

44
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:50,955
- Check his pulse!
- I don't like doing...

45
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:52,855
Motherfucker!

46
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:55,359
Oh, come on!
He bled in my mouth!

47
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:57,487
- Fuck!
- Oh, my God! What...

48
00:04:57,563 --> 00:05:00,225
- How badly is he hurt?
- We need to help him!

49
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,461
And he's in a fuckin' hospital gown!

50
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:03,763
- Calm down!
- He could have anything!

51
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:05,098
- Jesus Christ!
- We have to help him.

52
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:06,604
Bobby, help me, please.

53
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:09,039
- We gotta do something.
- You gotta be fuckin' kidding me!

54
00:05:10,943 --> 00:05:12,535
Hey, over here!

55
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,081
- Over here!
- Here!

56
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,443
Yeah! Hey!

57
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:23,420
Yeah, come on, come on.

58
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:24,979
There's... S-Some guy
came out from nowhere, man.

59
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:26,719
Over here, man.
There's somebody on the ground.

60
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:28,090
He's wearing a hospital gown.

61
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,288
- Can you tell me what happened?
- The guy came from out of nowhere.

62
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:32,194
Is he gonna be okay?

63
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:37,801
That's him.

64
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,771
Easy. Come on.

65
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:46,734
- Easy.
- On 3.

66
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:48,303
1, 2, 3!

67
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:51,412
Jesus.

68
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:54,313
Easy, buddy. Let's go.

69
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:00,948
Come on, buddy.

70
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,824
On 3, baby. Ready?
1, 2, 3, go!

71
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:10,428
What the hell is this guy doing out here?

72
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:12,095
He freaked out before surgery and ran.

73
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:13,263
The drugs do that sometimes.

74
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:15,273
We've been looking for this guy for hours.

75
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:16,899
Doc is gonna be pissed, man.

76
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:17,965
I heard that.

77
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,035
You know, you guys look pretty banged up.

78
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:22,581
You might need some medical attention.

79
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:23,979
What about the car?

80
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,883
Well, you know, I think the most
important thing right now is your health.

81
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:29,251
I mean, we can call a tow truck if you want.

82
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:31,256
If you want to hop in...

83
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:33,121
- Okay.
- Just watch your step.

84
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:37,822
- That's it.
- Now you, cowboy.

85
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,694
Watch your step, buddy.
There you go.

86
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:40,994
Everything's gonna be okay.

87
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:52,604
I can't believe this is happening.

88
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,681
He's not gonna make it.
He's dying.

89
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,986
That's nice.
You a fuckin' doctor?

90
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:12,360
You're gonna be okay.

91
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,764
We're almost at the hospital.
You're gonna make it, okay?

92
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:18,561
No!

93
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:44,829
Okay, everybody.
Come on out.

94
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:45,829
Watch your step, darlin'.

95
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:47,160
It's very slippery here.
Careful.

96
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:49,394
There you go.
Nice and easy.

97
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,061
Step out. It's slippery.

98
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:01,308
It'll be okay, son.
It'll be okay.

99
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:04,075
It's gonna be okay.

100
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,617
Don't worry.

101
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,421
Everyone, please.
Please take a seat.

102
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,321
Thank you.

103
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,961
Aren't we a bunch of lucky ducks?

104
00:08:16,028 --> 00:08:18,462
Now, is anyone experiencing
any dizziness,

105
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:20,226
shortness of breath, or pain?

106
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:23,166
My n... My neck is really sore.

107
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:25,033
Probably whiplash.
We'll take a look.

108
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:27,402
Yeah, ma'am, I swallowed
a ton of that guy's blood, so...

109
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:29,338
All right. Well, nothin' serious.

110
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:30,773
Nothing serious?
What, are you kidding?

111
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:32,401
I could've caught anything.
You see that guy?

112
00:08:32,478 --> 00:08:34,776
Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you to wait

113
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:36,542
while we tend to our more
critical patients first.

114
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:37,708
I got his blood in my mouth!

115
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:39,876
We have been operating
on a skeleton crew

116
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:41,886
ever since Katrina,
and we're very backed up.

117
00:08:41,954 --> 00:08:43,421
I'm sure you understand.

118
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:48,125
Now, if each one of you
will fill out these forms

119
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,788
as thoroughly as possible,
we can get started.

120
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:53,491
- Wait. Where's Emily?
- I think she's still outside.

121
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:55,966
- Do you want me to go get her?
- I'll go.

122
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:06,433
Hey.

123
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:08,875
You okay?

124
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:11,007
It looks like it's gonna rain.

125
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:15,386
Em, he's in good hands.

126
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:18,314
What if he dies?

127
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,256
He's not gonna die.

128
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:23,227
Oh, my God, what if... what if he has kids
waiting for him to come home?

129
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:25,161
Stop.

130
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,426
They're gonna take good care of him inside.

131
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:31,159
Baby, it wasn't your fault.

132
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,795
It was an accident.

133
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:37,670
- Sorry. I'll be fine.
- Don't apologize.

134
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,675
Everything's gonna be all right,

135
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:44,648
and we're gonna get through this together.

136
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:47,843
Listen to me.

137
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,050
I could be infected
with God knows what, okay?

138
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:53,751
Now, what does this guy have?

139
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:56,294
Heart disease.
You can't catch it.

140
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:58,956
Sit.

141
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:06,530
Come on. Let's go inside.

142
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,096
In a minute. I just...

143
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:11,541
I just need to prepare myself
for the smell.

144
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,841
The smell?

145
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:16,245
They all smell the same, hospitals.

146
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:18,374
I hate that smell.

147
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,645
I know.

148
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:22,313
But you still have to go inside
and get checked out.

149
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:24,379
We'll be back on the road in a few hours,

150
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,687
and before you know it,
this will all be over.

151
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,726
I love you.

152
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,230
I love you, too.

153
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:42,003
Bobby, you're bleeding.

154
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:44,167
It's nothing.
It's just a scrape.

155
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:47,304
I'll be all right.

156
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:52,707
- Yes.
- Marian.

157
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:54,377
Dr. Benway.

158
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:58,513
How unfortunate.

159
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:00,286
- Yes, I understand.
- Quickly.

160
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:02,725
- I'll take care of it right away.
- Make it happen.

161
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:03,989
Thank you.

162
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:07,864
Good news, young man.

163
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:09,901
An exam room just opened up.

164
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:12,062
Finally. Thank you.

165
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:14,163
Excuse me, Nurse.
My boyfriend's bleeding.

166
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,730
- Have a seat.
- No, but he's bleeding.

167
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:19,369
- It's nothing.
- Fine. I'll take a look at it.

168
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,837
- You okay?
- Yeah.

169
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,477
She's right.
We gotta take care of that.

170
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,686
Is that glass?

171
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:33,088
- Doesn't even hurt.
- Adrenaline will do that.

172
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:34,956
It's just a little sliver.

173
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,959
Yeah, shit, Bobby.
That doesn't look too good.

174
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,464
Oh, my God.

175
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,557
No.

176
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:43,625
- Don't touch that!
- No. Fuck, dude.

177
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:44,692
Dude.

178
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:48,373
- Jesus, Bobby. You okay?
- Bobby, stop pulling.

179
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,808
You all right?
You okay?

180
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:53,811
Oh, my God! Bobby!

181
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,245
Travis, patient transport now!

182
00:11:57,249 --> 00:11:59,877
Hey, somebody get...
get a fucking doctor here!

183
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:00,941
Stay back.

184
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:04,613
Get over here!

185
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,628
Travis! Hurry up!

186
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:11,754
Hurry up!

187
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:13,890
I want you to take him
to operating room number 2.

188
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:15,433
Baby.

189
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:19,499
No!

190
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,540
Miss? I'm sorry, sugar.

191
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:23,541
This is hospital policy.

192
00:12:26,712 --> 00:12:28,680
Oh, my God.

193
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:34,348
Oh, my God.
I want to go with him.

194
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,512
It's gonna be okay.

195
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,988
I wanna go with him.

196
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:53,833
- I think that's it.
- All right.

197
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:55,931
My boyfriend... is there any news?

198
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:58,135
Not yet.

199
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:00,804
I don't see any contact info

200
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,848
for either you or Bobby.

201
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:04,382
Bobby's parents are in Europe.

202
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,747
I don't know where they're staying.

203
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:07,445
Excuse me.

204
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:11,255
Yes?

205
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:13,154
Of course. Right away.

206
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,687
Dr. Benway would like
to talk to you in person.

207
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:19,697
- What is it?
- Not to worry.

208
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:22,325
- Third floor, fourth door on your left.
- Is he gonna be okay?

209
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:24,266
Elevators are right through that door.

210
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:29,005
Third floor. Thank you.

211
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:31,541
My pleasure.

212
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:07,370
This you're gonna laugh about in a few days.

213
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:08,936
Thanks.

214
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:12,812
You know...

215
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:17,185
you're actually very beautiful
when you're not terrified.

216
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:44,308
Don't leave me here.

217
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:48,185
Don't leave me here.

218
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:54,525
God, that's killing me. Nurse?

219
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:56,788
It's gonna be okay.
I'm with you.

220
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,930
Fuck it. I gotta go take a leak.

221
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:08,530
Yeah, okay.

222
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:26,353
Aw, this is a fuckin' joke.

223
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:56,981
- Emily Hosfield?
- Yes.

224
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:02,519
I'm Dr. Benway.

225
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:03,959
Bobby's gonna be fine.

226
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:05,690
The glass didn't pierce his lung after all.

227
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:06,856
Thank God.

228
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:09,059
I do have a few questions.

229
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:10,123
Sure.

230
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:17,166
Where is he?

231
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:19,669
Who?

232
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:20,905
Your friend.

233
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,416
I need all my little ducks here for triage.

234
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,542
I think he went to the bathroom.

235
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:35,051
Do you happen to know if Bobby
has any immunosuppressive disorders

236
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:37,891
such as lupus, Graves', vasculitis?

237
00:16:37,963 --> 00:16:39,123
Has he ever mentioned anything like that?

238
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:42,463
No. But what does that
have to do with his injury?

239
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:44,331
Well, it's a complicated medical issue.

240
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:46,837
I don't really have time to go over
every little detail.

241
00:16:46,905 --> 00:16:48,896
I did go to medical school.

242
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,943
Wonderful.

243
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,980
When did you graduate?

244
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:56,036
I didn't.

245
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:59,516
I dropped out after my first year.

246
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:01,143
That's a shame.

247
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,950
Well, I'm sure you'll be going
back to school soon.

248
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,684
No, I don't think so.

249
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:07,521
Well, I wouldn't be too sure, Emily.

250
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:09,720
As my wife always tells me,

251
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:12,025
I didn't choose medicine,
medicine chose me.

252
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,300
Now, if you go to the lobby...

253
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:18,461
Wait. Can I see Bobby first?

254
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:21,335
No. The nurse will contact you
if I have any more questions.

255
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,874
Please.
I'd really like to see him.

256
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:25,671
The nurse will contact you
if I have any more questions.

257
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,402
It's Scott. I found him.

258
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:59,841
You know, Dr. Benway really hates it
when people wander off in his hospital.

259
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:04,513
We can go with medicinal purposes, right?

260
00:18:05,717 --> 00:18:09,517
You know, running security
in this place is a full-time job.

261
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:13,684
Think I don't have better things to do
than locate burn-outs in bathrooms?

262
00:18:17,162 --> 00:18:18,686
Burn-outs. Got it.

263
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:21,931
Well, let me just get rid of this.

264
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,093
Yeah, I suggest you do that
immediately because...

265
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:29,399
...I can get you something a lot better.

266
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:22,457
Do you know where
the patient recovery room is?

267
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:25,657
That sounds nice.

268
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:30,126
Are you okay?

269
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:33,968
Do you want me to get a nurse
or a doctor, someone to help you?

270
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:36,337
What makes you think
they're here to help?

271
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:09,005
You want one of my sisters, too?
And I have six of them.

272
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:10,598
- Wow.
- Yes, and I'm the baby,

273
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:13,110
so everyone spoiled me rotten.

274
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:17,437
Yes?

275
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,915
Room 3. Right away.

276
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:23,016
Excuse me.

277
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:25,283
Dmitri Osipov, they're ready for you.

278
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:26,915
Room 3, third floor.

279
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:29,961
I'll wait for her girlfriend to come back
so she's not alone.

280
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:31,893
I'm sorry.
You have to go right away.

281
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:34,091
We run a very tight ship here, I'm afraid.

282
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,691
It's okay, Dmitri.
I'll be fine.

283
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:38,429
It's nothing, right?

284
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:39,492
Sure.

285
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,269
I'll see you later.

286
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:05,560
Well, look at what we got here.

287
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:06,893
The promised land.

288
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:11,500
Go ahead and pick your poison.

289
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:15,131
There's this new synthetic
morphine derivative that's the shit, bro.

290
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:16,504
It's primo.

291
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:19,367
What would you like?

292
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:21,002
What do you have?

293
00:21:56,581 --> 00:21:58,139
Hello?

294
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,924
Is that nitrous?

295
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,663
Yeah, my college roommate was into this.

296
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:19,863
30-second buzz, right?

297
00:22:20,972 --> 00:22:22,439
Not in here, bro.

298
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:24,134
That shit is flammable.

299
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:26,973
Okay. Relax.
I wasn't gonna turn it on.

300
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:28,034
Okay.

301
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:33,345
Okay. All right.

302
00:22:35,053 --> 00:22:36,543
How about a couple of barbiturates?

303
00:22:36,621 --> 00:22:38,589
Strong enough to stop a fucking rhino?

304
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:41,825
You got any antibiotics?

305
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:47,928
I just brought you to chemical Disneyland,
and you want a fucking antibiotic?

306
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:49,626
This guy bled in my mouth.

307
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,965
That's fucked up.
Did you ask him to?

308
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:56,366
Look, I gotta split.
Go ahead and...

309
00:22:56,441 --> 00:22:58,966
- You go ahead and pick your poison.
- Thank you.

310
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:02,268
What's this?

311
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:06,947
Nope. You don't want
to mess with these babies.

312
00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:09,486
These haven't even been submitted
to the FDA for approval yet.

313
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:11,749
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

314
00:23:11,823 --> 00:23:15,987
Doc used to work
for Zidexx Pharmaceuticals.

315
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,790
He gets us all the good shit, man.

316
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:24,295
- You tried those?
- Sure, yeah. It's good.

317
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:29,704
Take care.

318
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:32,175
Amen. Follow me.

319
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:01,634
Doctor?

320
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:10,905
This is bullshit.

321
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:18,365
- Bobby?
- Emil...

322
00:26:18,443 --> 00:26:19,432
Bobby.

323
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:34,721
Emily.

324
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:47,565
- Sorry.
- What are you doing here?

325
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:50,403
I have been looking all over for you.

326
00:26:50,475 --> 00:26:53,308
Dr. Benway told me
he gave you specific instructions.

327
00:26:53,378 --> 00:26:55,710
I'm just trying to find my boyfriend.
I want to be there when...

328
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,873
You have to stop worrying
about your boyfriend

329
00:26:57,949 --> 00:26:59,576
and start worrying about yourself.

330
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:01,278
- Really...
- You need to be checked out as well.

331
00:27:01,353 --> 00:27:03,480
- I'm fine.
- You have been in an accident,

332
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:05,750
young lady,
and whether you like it or not,

333
00:27:05,824 --> 00:27:07,291
once you come through our doors,

334
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:10,920
it is our medical and legal responsibility

335
00:27:10,996 --> 00:27:12,588
to assess your condition.

336
00:27:12,664 --> 00:27:14,188
I'm seriously fine.

337
00:27:18,503 --> 00:27:22,303
Now, please take a seat,
and Dr. Benway will be with you shortly.

338
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:30,880
Don't worry, son.

339
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:34,475
I set up a nice lounge in here.

340
00:27:34,552 --> 00:27:36,417
You know, couches, plasma screen TV.

341
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,820
It's where I like to chill
when I've sampled the merchandise.

342
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:40,221
- Yeah, all right.
- Yeah.

343
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:47,592
<i>Mi casa es su casa, bro.
Check it out.</i>

344
00:27:51,603 --> 00:27:53,594
What... Are you kidding me? Hey!

345
00:27:54,873 --> 00:27:56,363
Hey, come on, man.
This ain't funny.

346
00:27:56,441 --> 00:27:58,932
Hey, come on, man.
I just dropped this fuckin' thing.

347
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,102
- Don't leave me! Please!
- It's Scott.

348
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:01,805
- Listen.
- Motherfucker!

349
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,643
Open the fuckin' door!

350
00:28:03,715 --> 00:28:06,411
Open the fuckin'... I swear to God!
Open the door!

351
00:28:10,121 --> 00:28:11,918
Yeah. I got him.

352
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,473
Jesus Christ.

353
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:59,165
Doctor.

354
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:00,704
Am I going to be okay?

355
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:02,672
I don't think so.

356
00:30:56,154 --> 00:30:58,952
Get the fuck outta here.

357
00:32:30,515 --> 00:32:31,504
Hello?

358
00:32:31,582 --> 00:32:35,575
Help me.

359
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:39,885
Help me.

360
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,222
Hello?

361
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:48,296
Who is this?

362
00:32:48,366 --> 00:32:49,833
Do you need a nurse?

363
00:33:50,128 --> 00:33:51,891
Do you need help?

364
00:34:30,668 --> 00:34:32,158
No.

365
00:35:27,892 --> 00:35:29,189
Impressed?

366
00:35:33,397 --> 00:35:35,524
I'm not nearly as vain as it looks.

367
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:39,627
All these awards and compensation
are really a means to an end.

368
00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:41,763
This hard work has allowed me
to move down here

369
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:44,967
and open this clinic for people
who really need the help.

370
00:35:45,042 --> 00:35:47,135
How's Bobby doing?

371
00:35:47,211 --> 00:35:50,442
I had to remove one last glass fragment
from his left pectoral.

372
00:35:50,515 --> 00:35:52,176
- Yeah?
- He's fine.

373
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:55,308
Have a seat.

374
00:35:55,386 --> 00:35:57,149
I understand you hit your head
in the accident?

375
00:35:57,221 --> 00:35:59,121
It's nothing serious.

376
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:02,717
Well, I'll be the judge of that.

377
00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:07,661
- Gonna look in your eyes.
- Okay.

378
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,192
Tilt your head back, please.

379
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:12,861
Can you open your mouth?

380
00:36:12,937 --> 00:36:14,768
Say "Ahh."

381
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,431
Looks fine.

382
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:19,374
So, why did you leave medical school?

383
00:36:19,443 --> 00:36:21,377
I was hardly ever there.

384
00:36:21,445 --> 00:36:23,913
I think I got about as far as,
"First, do no harm."

385
00:36:23,981 --> 00:36:26,609
Bet your parents wanted you
to be a doctor.

386
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:32,782
Actually, my dad died
about a month ago from bone cancer.

387
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:34,847
So...

388
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:37,683
Yeah.

389
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:42,723
Family illness can be one of the great
life-altering experiences.

390
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,324
- Yep.
- No doubt about it.

391
00:36:44,402 --> 00:36:45,835
I'm sorry.

392
00:36:45,903 --> 00:36:47,928
That's all the more reason
for you to go back

393
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:49,233
to medical school, though, isn't it?

394
00:36:49,307 --> 00:36:51,468
No. I don't think so.

395
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:56,369
- Breathe deeply.
- Okay.

396
00:37:00,851 --> 00:37:03,979
I know what it's like, you know,
to have a loved one suffering.

397
00:37:07,758 --> 00:37:09,487
My wife became ill last year.

398
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,859
Her doctors diagnosed her
with terminal cancer.

399
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:14,591
Traditional medicine didn't work.

400
00:37:14,665 --> 00:37:17,395
- I'm sorry. Did she...
- No, no.

401
00:37:17,468 --> 00:37:19,197
Now with an experimental treatment,

402
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:21,534
she's actually making an amazing recovery.

403
00:37:21,606 --> 00:37:23,574
- Miraculous, really.
- That's great.

404
00:37:23,641 --> 00:37:25,939
- We're going to Italy in a month.
- Really?

405
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:30,003
Yes. I... I couldn't imagine
what would happen if I had lost her.

406
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,281
Yeah.

407
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:37,350
Take off your shirt, please.

408
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:44,785
Yeah.

409
00:37:50,868 --> 00:37:54,463
Keep your face towards the door,
your back to me.

410
00:37:54,538 --> 00:37:56,199
Bring your knees to your chest.

411
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:58,174
The fetal position.

412
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:00,933
Okay.

413
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:10,283
Is that good?

414
00:38:10,354 --> 00:38:13,118
Yes. It's fine, thank you.

415
00:38:16,394 --> 00:38:17,520
What are we doing?

416
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:22,495
A lumbar puncture.

417
00:38:22,566 --> 00:38:25,399
We need to check
your spinal fluid for blood,

418
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:28,165
see if you had an aneurysm
with that head trauma.

419
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:29,968
Shouldn't I just be having a CT scan?

420
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:32,168
No, no, no.
A CT scan isn't necessary.

421
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:34,768
But you see? You can't shake
the instincts of a doctor.

422
00:38:34,845 --> 00:38:37,211
You really do have it in your blood.

423
00:38:37,281 --> 00:38:39,545
No pun intended.

424
00:38:39,617 --> 00:38:42,745
Now, this is gonna pinch a little bit.

425
00:38:47,391 --> 00:38:48,289
Don't move.

426
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:51,157
You don't want this needle
ripping through your spinal cord, do you?

427
00:38:56,734 --> 00:38:57,723
That...

428
00:39:04,108 --> 00:39:06,042
That fucking hurts.
Oh, my God.

429
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:08,908
There's no need for such
coarse language, young lady.

430
00:39:55,826 --> 00:39:56,815
Perfect.

431
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:01,521
You can get dressed now.

432
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:12,101
So, have you talked to Bobby's parents?

433
00:40:15,346 --> 00:40:17,473
They really should know what's going on.

434
00:40:18,949 --> 00:40:21,543
I talked to them a half an hour ago,
as a matter of fact.

435
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:24,816
They're very excited about Bobby
getting home to see them.

436
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:42,256
Oh, man.

437
00:41:52,877 --> 00:41:54,538
Oh, man, I'm tired.

438
00:41:58,649 --> 00:42:00,617
Hey, Travis?

439
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:02,151
The doc wants to examine her.

440
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:04,779
Shit, man, I'm just gettin' started.

441
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:06,618
Goddamn it.

442
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:08,988
You know, they don't
pay me enough for this shit.

443
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:10,151
Come on, man.

444
00:42:10,227 --> 00:42:13,253
It pays hell of a lot more
than making license plates up in Angola.

445
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:15,821
Remember that?
You want to do that again?

446
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,458
We got a good deal here.

447
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,769
When do you think we're moving shop?

448
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:21,827
In a month?

449
00:42:21,906 --> 00:42:23,237
No, it's gonna be sooner.

450
00:42:23,307 --> 00:42:25,969
The doc went all out
on this latest procedure, man.

451
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:29,809
His wife is actually doing better,
if you can believe that.

452
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:33,740
Jesus.

453
00:42:35,452 --> 00:42:37,283
Maybe he's not as crazy as he seems.

454
00:42:37,354 --> 00:42:39,914
Yeah, well, let's not go too far, all right?

455
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:47,660
What are we gonna do
with all these patients when we move?

456
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:48,789
Let's just leave 'em here.

457
00:42:48,866 --> 00:42:50,663
Where are they gonna go on their own?

458
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:52,793
None of 'em can even count to 6
or even feed themself,

459
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:54,861
or wipe their ass, so fuck 'em.

460
00:42:54,939 --> 00:42:58,397
We could bulldoze a big pit,
shove 'em in,

461
00:42:58,475 --> 00:43:00,966
throw gasoline on 'em,
and then watch 'em burn.

462
00:43:01,045 --> 00:43:02,307
- Or we could...
- I gotta go.

463
00:43:02,379 --> 00:43:05,610
Get her up to the exam room now.

464
00:43:05,683 --> 00:43:07,708
- Okay?
- Well, wait a minute.

465
00:43:07,785 --> 00:43:10,413
If you're so worried about it,
you take her up.

466
00:43:10,487 --> 00:43:12,148
I got fingerprints
that I've gotta get rid of.

467
00:43:12,222 --> 00:43:15,089
What's wrong with you?
Why are you being such a little bitch?

468
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,650
Fuck you.

469
00:43:17,728 --> 00:43:21,528
Okay, look, just get her up
to an exam room

470
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:24,693
before the doc notices, please?

471
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:26,463
Yeah. Yeah.

472
00:45:20,117 --> 00:45:21,243
Jude.

473
00:45:22,786 --> 00:45:24,253
Jude.

474
00:45:27,191 --> 00:45:29,989
What did you do? What...

475
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,620
There's something under there
and I just can't find it.

476
00:45:32,696 --> 00:45:35,164
Jude, stop it.
What did they do to you?

477
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:37,723
What happened?

478
00:45:37,801 --> 00:45:39,962
He gave me a pill and...

479
00:45:40,037 --> 00:45:42,301
Okay, Jude, stop it.

480
00:45:42,372 --> 00:45:44,363
You're hallucinating, okay?

481
00:45:45,843 --> 00:45:48,607
We're going to find everyone else,
and we're going to get out of here, okay?

482
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:51,743
Do you know where anyone else is?

483
00:45:51,815 --> 00:45:54,511
I saw it.

484
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:56,576
I saw it.

485
00:45:56,653 --> 00:45:59,816
Whoever said there wasn't life after death?

486
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:03,485
Jude, take it easy, okay?

487
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:04,618
Come on.

488
00:46:15,038 --> 00:46:16,232
Come on.

489
00:46:24,548 --> 00:46:27,176
- Is everything in order, Doctor?
- So far.

490
00:46:27,251 --> 00:46:31,278
Good. And I am fine on this end.

491
00:46:31,355 --> 00:46:34,882
Steady heart rate.
Good healthy beat to it.

492
00:46:45,502 --> 00:46:48,300
By the way, Doctor,
I've just checked on the boy.

493
00:46:48,372 --> 00:46:50,397
I don't think he'll last 12 hours.

494
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:51,498
He has to.

495
00:46:51,575 --> 00:46:53,042
Lisette is doing much better.

496
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:55,704
The organs haven't been rejected.

497
00:46:58,515 --> 00:47:00,244
Tilt your head back, please.

498
00:47:08,091 --> 00:47:09,820
Reflex hammer. Thank you.

499
00:47:13,263 --> 00:47:14,890
This won't hurt a bit.

500
00:47:28,111 --> 00:47:30,079
This might hurt a little.

501
00:47:35,919 --> 00:47:37,386
Marian.

502
00:47:37,454 --> 00:47:38,978
Yes, Dr. Benway?
I'm right here.

503
00:47:39,056 --> 00:47:40,648
What did Travis do to her?

504
00:47:40,724 --> 00:47:43,192
He got carried away.
I'll deal with him.

505
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:45,558
Your job is to prevent these situations.

506
00:47:45,629 --> 00:47:48,496
I'm on the ground floor
of a major medical breakthrough.

507
00:47:48,565 --> 00:47:50,294
We've lost our first host.

508
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:51,527
Now she's useless, too.

509
00:47:51,602 --> 00:47:53,593
- I don't have time for this.
- No, of course not.

510
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:56,730
It won't happen again.
And we still have the other two.

511
00:47:56,807 --> 00:47:58,274
Do your job, Marian.

512
00:47:58,342 --> 00:48:00,333
Have Travis dispose of her.

513
00:48:04,014 --> 00:48:06,005
Pathetic.

514
00:48:06,083 --> 00:48:08,415
That's what we get for hiring ex-cons.

515
00:48:09,486 --> 00:48:10,976
Dr. Benway?

516
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:12,783
I have everything under control, sir.

517
00:48:12,856 --> 00:48:14,414
You don't have to worry.

518
00:48:19,329 --> 00:48:21,695
Clare. Clare.

519
00:48:21,765 --> 00:48:24,734
- No. Jesus.
- Oh, my God.

520
00:48:27,371 --> 00:48:29,532
Oh, shit.

521
00:48:35,946 --> 00:48:37,140
Help me get her up.

522
00:48:37,214 --> 00:48:39,148
Help me...

523
00:48:44,054 --> 00:48:48,115
Clare, baby. No.

524
00:49:08,879 --> 00:49:10,176
I'm done.

525
00:49:10,247 --> 00:49:12,841
I can't take this.
We're getting out of here.

526
00:49:12,916 --> 00:49:15,510
- Not until we find Bobby.
- Hey, don't you get it?

527
00:49:15,585 --> 00:49:16,643
Bobby's dead.

528
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,779
No, he's alive,
and we're going to find him.

529
00:49:18,855 --> 00:49:20,049
Emily, listen to me.

530
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:23,354
Emily, you don't want to end up like Clare.

531
00:49:23,427 --> 00:49:24,917
Huh?

532
00:49:24,995 --> 00:49:26,963
Your skull cracked open,
split up the middle...

533
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:28,019
Is that what you want?

534
00:49:28,098 --> 00:49:31,158
I'm gonna find Bobby.
That's what I want, okay?

535
00:49:31,234 --> 00:49:32,963
You've heard them.
He doesn't have much longer.

536
00:49:33,036 --> 00:49:35,834
I'm going to find him.

537
00:49:35,906 --> 00:49:37,897
Then you go find him.

538
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:39,966
What?

539
00:49:40,043 --> 00:49:41,704
I can't fucking handle this.

540
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:44,135
Jude...

541
00:49:44,214 --> 00:49:45,909
What everyone says about me is true.

542
00:49:48,618 --> 00:49:49,949
You're on your own.

543
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:51,009
Jude.

544
00:52:59,109 --> 00:53:02,510
- 911 emergency.
- I need help. Please.

545
00:53:02,579 --> 00:53:04,740
- Please.
- Hello? Hello?

546
00:53:04,814 --> 00:53:06,281
I can hardly hear you.

547
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:09,113
Someone is killing my friend.
I need you to send help out right away.

548
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:10,244
I'm at Mercy Hospital.

549
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:13,312
Ma'am, Mercy's been closed
for three years.

550
00:53:41,117 --> 00:53:43,244
We'll harvest her nerve tissue first.

551
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:44,912
Nerve tissue, of course.

552
00:53:47,657 --> 00:53:49,852
- What?
- Marian!

553
00:53:49,926 --> 00:53:50,915
No!

554
00:53:50,994 --> 00:53:53,622
This is the second patient
to escape in two days.

555
00:53:53,697 --> 00:53:54,959
I'm sorry, David.
So sorry.

556
00:53:55,031 --> 00:53:57,363
If she gets out of here, she'll jeopardize
everything I've worked for.

557
00:53:57,434 --> 00:53:59,334
- Do you understand me?
- I do.

558
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:02,132
- I know.
- Find her.

559
00:54:02,205 --> 00:54:05,470
Yes. You can count on me, David.

560
00:54:05,542 --> 00:54:07,840
You can... You can count on me.

561
00:54:13,049 --> 00:54:14,380
You can count on me, David.

562
00:54:14,451 --> 00:54:16,043
You can... You can count on me.

563
00:54:41,511 --> 00:54:42,500
Hello?

564
00:54:42,579 --> 00:54:44,945
No, it's Travis.

565
00:54:45,015 --> 00:54:46,642
What?

566
00:54:46,716 --> 00:54:48,547
I don't know where the hell he is.

567
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:51,951
I just found his phone ringing on the floor.

568
00:54:52,022 --> 00:54:53,114
All right.

569
00:55:15,378 --> 00:55:18,541
You can stop panicking.
She's right here.

570
00:55:25,622 --> 00:55:27,283
Fucking cunt!

571
00:55:32,562 --> 00:55:34,393
Come back!

572
00:55:48,645 --> 00:55:50,135
You listen to me.

573
00:55:50,213 --> 00:55:53,273
Try any bullshit,
I will rip your fucking head off.

574
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:54,578
You understand me?

575
00:56:06,396 --> 00:56:07,693
Good evening, Officer.

576
00:56:07,764 --> 00:56:09,095
- Evening.
- How can I help you?

577
00:56:09,165 --> 00:56:12,464
Yeah, I'm following up
on a 911 call we just received.

578
00:56:12,535 --> 00:56:14,935
This facility is listed as closed.

579
00:56:15,004 --> 00:56:17,472
Our funding only came through recently.

580
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:19,201
We're in the midst of reopening.

581
00:56:21,611 --> 00:56:23,602
What happened to your knee?

582
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:24,977
Oh, that?

583
00:56:26,816 --> 00:56:28,147
That's not my blood.

584
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:30,049
That was me.
I'm the one who called.

585
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:31,212
Stand back, ma'am.
Stand back.

586
00:56:31,287 --> 00:56:34,552
Sarah, that was you?
You called them?

587
00:56:34,624 --> 00:56:35,784
What were you thinking?

588
00:56:35,859 --> 00:56:37,258
You did that?

589
00:56:37,327 --> 00:56:39,659
Sarah's a patient up in Psychiatric.

590
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:40,753
I'm not a patient.

591
00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:42,525
No, they're murdering people.

592
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:45,261
My boyfriend, he's missing,
and I don't know where he is.

593
00:56:45,335 --> 00:56:48,361
- Slow down.
- Officer, I am so sorry about this.

594
00:56:48,438 --> 00:56:51,236
- Sarah, sweetie...
- Don't... My name's not Sarah.

595
00:56:51,307 --> 00:56:52,399
I'm Emily.

596
00:56:52,475 --> 00:56:53,772
Let me see some ID.

597
00:56:53,843 --> 00:56:54,969
Okay.

598
00:56:57,414 --> 00:56:59,245
Shit.

599
00:56:59,315 --> 00:57:01,306
Hold on.

600
00:57:01,384 --> 00:57:03,852
One second.

601
00:57:06,222 --> 00:57:08,452
Shit.

602
00:57:08,525 --> 00:57:10,755
Shit.

603
00:57:10,827 --> 00:57:12,294
We were... We were in a car accident.

604
00:57:12,362 --> 00:57:14,057
I must have lost it there.

605
00:57:15,865 --> 00:57:18,425
Really, I'm not crazy.
You have to believe me.

606
00:57:18,501 --> 00:57:21,299
I can show you... I can show you
where Clare's body is.

607
00:57:21,371 --> 00:57:22,668
I'm not crazy.

608
00:57:22,739 --> 00:57:24,104
Okay, Sarah.
Let's go, come on.

609
00:57:24,174 --> 00:57:25,300
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

610
00:57:25,375 --> 00:57:27,900
Let me check out her claim.
It's strictly procedure.

611
00:57:27,977 --> 00:57:29,308
What did you want me to see?

612
00:57:29,379 --> 00:57:31,847
Here, this way.
I can show you where Clare's body is.

613
00:57:31,915 --> 00:57:33,610
Go ahead.

614
00:57:41,057 --> 00:57:43,025
I keep trying to place you.

615
00:57:43,092 --> 00:57:45,424
Have we met before?

616
00:57:45,495 --> 00:57:48,328
I've... I've worked in a lot
of hospitals around here.

617
00:57:49,566 --> 00:57:51,363
No, that's not it.

618
00:57:51,434 --> 00:57:52,560
It's somewhere else.

619
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:55,365
- Maybe it was when...
- Here we are.

620
00:58:06,583 --> 00:58:08,551
She's here laying on...

621
00:58:13,122 --> 00:58:14,453
They... They moved her.

622
00:58:14,524 --> 00:58:16,355
She was... She was laying right here.

623
00:58:16,426 --> 00:58:19,725
I... I don't know where they put her.

624
00:58:19,796 --> 00:58:21,957
I don't know, but she was laying right here.

625
00:58:22,031 --> 00:58:25,933
Again, Officer, sorry you had to come
all the way out here for nothing.

626
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:27,765
I apologize.

627
00:58:27,837 --> 00:58:30,635
Listen to me, okay?

628
00:58:30,707 --> 00:58:32,436
I was with her.
She was laying right there.

629
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:34,306
I swear.
I promise you, okay?

630
00:58:34,377 --> 00:58:36,607
She had no back of her fucking head.

631
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:40,046
There was no... nothing there.
I can... I can...

632
00:58:40,116 --> 00:58:42,084
Listen. I can take you to a room
where there's body parts.

633
00:58:42,151 --> 00:58:43,618
I can show you everything.

634
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:45,745
And we have to find my boyfriend.
I don't know where...

635
00:58:45,822 --> 00:58:47,551
- Ma'am...
- T-55.

636
00:58:47,624 --> 00:58:50,024
Yeah, this is Jacobs.
I'm leaving the hospital now.

637
00:58:50,093 --> 00:58:51,958
You can go ahead and chalk this up
as a prank call.

638
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:53,893
No, I'm telling the truth.

639
00:58:53,963 --> 00:58:55,760
- No.
- Thank you for your cooperation, sir.

640
00:58:55,832 --> 00:58:57,163
- No problem.
- Wait.

641
00:58:57,233 --> 00:58:59,064
We'll make sure a patient
doesn't call you guys again.

642
00:58:59,135 --> 00:59:00,124
- No, wait...
- I'm sorry for...

643
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:02,103
You can't go, all right?
They're going to kill me.

644
00:59:02,171 --> 00:59:03,160
- Please.
- It's okay, Sarah.

645
00:59:03,239 --> 00:59:05,298
- No, you have to believe me.
- Let's get you back upstairs.

646
00:59:31,868 --> 00:59:34,496
How have you let things
get this far out of control?

647
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:36,698
This situation is still manageable.

648
00:59:36,773 --> 00:59:39,640
I'll get the patrol car out of sight,
and I'll take care of the body.

649
00:59:39,709 --> 00:59:41,074
She called 911.

650
00:59:41,144 --> 00:59:42,406
- She brought this on.
- No.

651
00:59:42,478 --> 00:59:45,106
Sir, if we start packing now,
we can be out of here by dawn.

652
00:59:45,181 --> 00:59:47,012
Lisette's not ready.
We're not going anywhere.

653
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:48,607
Get her down to O.R.

654
00:59:48,685 --> 00:59:50,152
Have Marian prep her for surgery.

655
00:59:50,219 --> 00:59:52,312
Yes, sir. Move.

656
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:54,921
No. Please. No.

657
00:59:54,991 --> 00:59:56,686
Please.

658
00:59:56,759 --> 00:59:58,021
No.

659
01:00:50,947 --> 01:00:53,108
Now, now, relax.

660
01:00:53,182 --> 01:00:55,150
It's not like this is brain surgery.

661
01:01:01,090 --> 01:01:02,387
No...

662
01:01:23,613 --> 01:01:25,604
What kind of ridiculous equipment is this?

663
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:29,448
I'm sorry, Doctor.
Everything's made overseas these days.

664
01:01:46,736 --> 01:01:49,398
It always gets harder when it hits the bone.

665
01:02:04,487 --> 01:02:06,580
Shut off the music!

666
01:02:08,424 --> 01:02:09,652
This isn't working.

667
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:10,988
Find me an electric drill.

668
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:12,493
Right away, Doctor.
Right away.

669
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:14,427
I have to go talk to Lisette.

670
01:02:14,497 --> 01:02:16,089
Watch her until I get back.

671
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:34,649
No. No.

672
01:02:41,324 --> 01:02:43,155
Uh-oh, someone's got a boo-boo.

673
01:02:52,468 --> 01:02:55,960
Get the fuck away from me!

674
01:02:57,874 --> 01:02:59,705
You can't do this.
The doctor's gonna...

675
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:01,641
You think I give a shit what the doc says?

676
01:03:01,711 --> 01:03:04,179
He's out of his fucking mind,
in case you haven't noticed.

677
01:03:04,247 --> 01:03:07,045
The way things are going tonight,
it's going to get a lot worse.

678
01:03:18,394 --> 01:03:20,624
No, don't. Don't.

679
01:03:20,696 --> 01:03:22,493
No.

680
01:03:22,565 --> 01:03:23,725
No, no. Don't.

681
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,768
Please, don't.

682
01:03:57,867 --> 01:03:59,459
God! Fuck!

683
01:03:59,535 --> 01:04:01,162
Fucking cunt!

684
01:04:10,112 --> 01:04:12,205
You sick fuck!

685
01:04:12,281 --> 01:04:16,240
You sick piece of shit!

686
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:19,186
You sick fuck!

687
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:26,119
Sick fuck!

688
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:52,310
Miss?

689
01:04:55,458 --> 01:04:56,652
Ma'am?

690
01:04:59,795 --> 01:05:01,319
Excuse me, miss...

691
01:05:03,699 --> 01:05:07,829
...if there's any way you can help me
get out of this hospital...

692
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:09,337
You see, I'm...

693
01:05:11,374 --> 01:05:16,311
I'm... I'm trying to...
trying to find an exit, so...

694
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:45,066
I have to go back to work now, darling.

695
01:05:45,141 --> 01:05:47,166
I know I made promises to you before,

696
01:05:47,243 --> 01:05:49,268
but this time, we're close.

697
01:05:50,813 --> 01:05:52,610
Soon we'll be back in Rome,

698
01:05:52,682 --> 01:05:54,912
strolling through the Piazza Navona,

699
01:05:54,984 --> 01:05:56,815
the Villa Borghese.

700
01:06:00,022 --> 01:06:01,455
Rest.

701
01:06:01,524 --> 01:06:03,492
I'll come visit you soon.

702
01:06:33,122 --> 01:06:35,090
- What do you want me to do with her?
- Hook her up.

703
01:06:35,157 --> 01:06:36,419
No.

704
01:06:36,492 --> 01:06:38,653
First, we do no harm, Emily.

705
01:06:39,662 --> 01:06:43,462
Then after that, things get a little blurry.

706
01:06:48,571 --> 01:06:49,731
Jude!

707
01:07:05,521 --> 01:07:07,216
No!

708
01:07:15,297 --> 01:07:16,594
Oh, shit.

709
01:07:19,502 --> 01:07:20,833
I got it.

710
01:07:21,837 --> 01:07:22,826
Okay.

711
01:07:26,409 --> 01:07:29,503
Okay, I'm going to hold them back.
I need you to run as fast as you can.

712
01:07:29,578 --> 01:07:30,567
- Promise me.
- No, no.

713
01:07:30,646 --> 01:07:32,705
Listen to me.
I'm right behind you, okay?

714
01:07:32,782 --> 01:07:35,148
- Jude, I'm not going without you.
- Come on.

715
01:07:35,217 --> 01:07:37,651
I need you to do this.
Run. I have to.

716
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:39,051
Jude!

717
01:07:39,121 --> 01:07:41,214
Jude, open the fucking door.

718
01:07:48,264 --> 01:07:49,595
Jude, what are you doing?

719
01:07:49,665 --> 01:07:51,030
Come on.

720
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:53,193
Open the door.

721
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:57,437
No, open... Just open the door.

722
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:04,072
Please!

723
01:08:04,146 --> 01:08:06,944
Jude, you don't have to do this!

724
01:08:07,016 --> 01:08:08,210
Please.

725
01:08:09,385 --> 01:08:10,716
Get the fuck out of here, Emily!

726
01:08:10,786 --> 01:08:12,083
- Run, now!
- Not without you.

727
01:08:17,159 --> 01:08:19,150
Don't do this.

728
01:08:23,866 --> 01:08:26,232
Come on.

729
01:08:26,302 --> 01:08:27,394
Come on.

730
01:10:51,747 --> 01:10:52,805
Bobby.

731
01:10:52,881 --> 01:10:54,815
Emily?

732
01:10:54,883 --> 01:10:56,874
I'm here.

733
01:10:56,952 --> 01:10:58,044
I'm here, okay?

734
01:10:58,120 --> 01:11:01,351
I'm going to get you out of here, I promise.

735
01:11:18,941 --> 01:11:21,375
There's something wrong.

736
01:11:21,443 --> 01:11:24,173
I can't really see.

737
01:11:25,848 --> 01:11:31,115
Please, I want to get out of here.

738
01:11:31,186 --> 01:11:33,017
I want to get out of here.

739
01:11:33,088 --> 01:11:34,214
I know.

740
01:11:35,891 --> 01:11:37,722
I know you do.

741
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:40,819
Oh, baby.

742
01:11:42,631 --> 01:11:44,030
Help me.

743
01:11:45,634 --> 01:11:48,603
It's all going to be okay, I promise.

744
01:11:48,671 --> 01:11:50,366
I promise.

745
01:11:53,842 --> 01:11:56,072
Just close your eyes, okay?

746
01:11:57,746 --> 01:12:00,874
- Close your eyes.
- Yeah.

747
01:12:00,949 --> 01:12:02,041
Think of something nice.

748
01:12:06,088 --> 01:12:08,886
New York, last summer.

749
01:12:08,957 --> 01:12:11,482
You remember?

750
01:12:14,096 --> 01:12:16,997
Do you remember our walk
along the East River?

751
01:12:17,066 --> 01:12:18,499
Where you told me...

752
01:12:20,936 --> 01:12:22,563
I told you...

753
01:12:24,707 --> 01:12:27,437
...I loved you.

754
01:12:27,509 --> 01:12:29,238
Yeah.

755
01:12:30,546 --> 01:12:33,242
That was the first time
you ever said it to me.

756
01:12:33,315 --> 01:12:36,045
And it only took me two years.

757
01:12:39,321 --> 01:12:41,118
Are you thinking of that now?

758
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:43,886
- Yeah.
- Good.

759
01:12:48,530 --> 01:12:51,465
- Baby?
- Yeah?

760
01:12:51,533 --> 01:12:54,093
Are you going to get me out of here?

761
01:12:55,471 --> 01:12:57,871
Yes, baby.

762
01:12:57,940 --> 01:13:02,570
Just keep thinking about the river...

763
01:13:04,947 --> 01:13:07,643
...about us, okay?

764
01:13:07,716 --> 01:13:09,274
Just keep thinking.

765
01:13:14,289 --> 01:13:16,450
Just keep thinking.

766
01:14:31,099 --> 01:14:34,535
I have to do every
fucking little thing myself!

767
01:14:48,383 --> 01:14:50,408
You got me dirty!

768
01:15:06,401 --> 01:15:08,198
Bleed out, bitch.

769
01:15:32,961 --> 01:15:34,895
Help me.

770
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:40,527
Help me.

771
01:16:40,762 --> 01:16:45,495
This was all because of you, wasn't it?

772
01:16:45,567 --> 01:16:47,159
Help me.

773
01:16:50,005 --> 01:16:52,337
You're the reason everybody's dead.

774
01:16:54,242 --> 01:16:56,403
Help me.

775
01:16:59,348 --> 01:17:01,145
It was all because of you.

776
01:17:19,968 --> 01:17:21,526
No!

777
01:17:23,338 --> 01:17:24,396
You're next.

778
01:17:57,439 --> 01:17:59,236
No, don't!

779
01:18:13,355 --> 01:18:15,755
Die!

780
01:18:17,392 --> 01:18:19,758
Die!

781
01:19:23,959 --> 01:19:25,517
You were right.

782
01:19:29,798 --> 01:19:32,358
I always was meant to be a doctor.
