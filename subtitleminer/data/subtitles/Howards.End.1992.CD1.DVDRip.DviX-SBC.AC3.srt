"Dearest Meg,
I'm having a glorious time.

2
00:04:21,869 --> 00:04:23,302
I like them all.

3
00:04:23,371 --> 00:04:26,465
They are the happiest,
jolliest family you can imagine.

4
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:29,476
The fun of it is,
they think me a noodle.

5
00:04:29,544 --> 00:04:33,207
And say so.
At least Mr. Wilcox does.

6
00:04:33,281 --> 00:04:36,341
Oh, Meg, shall we ever learn
to talk less.

7
00:04:37,452 --> 00:04:39,716
But dearest Meg...

8
00:04:39,787 --> 00:04:42,221
i don't know what to say
or what you will say.

9
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:45,350
Paul wilcox and I are in love.

10
00:04:45,426 --> 00:04:47,360
We are engaged."

11
00:04:50,698 --> 00:04:54,031
- Well, you Schlegel girls!
- Tibby, look.

12
00:04:54,102 --> 00:04:56,866
Margaret, if I may interfere.

13
00:04:56,938 --> 00:04:59,873
What is going on?

14
00:04:59,941 --> 00:05:04,207
I can tell you nothing, aunt Juley.
I know no more than you do.

15
00:05:04,278 --> 00:05:08,681
We only met the wilcoxes last spring
while we were hiking in germany.

16
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,650
Oh, dear.

17
00:05:10,718 --> 00:05:13,846
Someone must go down to howards house
to make inquiries.

18
00:05:13,921 --> 00:05:17,015
- Howards end.
- Inquiries are necessary.

19
00:05:17,091 --> 00:05:21,892
What do we know about these wilcoxes?
Are they our sort? Likely people?

20
00:05:21,963 --> 00:05:25,057
But aunt Juley, what does it matter?

21
00:05:25,133 --> 00:05:28,762
Helen's in love.
That's all I need to know.

22
00:05:31,072 --> 00:05:33,563
Please get me a train timetable, dear.

23
00:05:52,026 --> 00:05:53,960
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

24
00:05:58,266 --> 00:05:59,790
Paul?

25
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:06,168
I'm afraid Crane
has reported sick again.

26
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,006
He was to take me to the worrington's
today for tennis. I told them.

27
00:06:10,077 --> 00:06:12,011
He's standing, of course.

28
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:14,809
Get rid of him, father,
hire a new chauffeur.

29
00:06:17,451 --> 00:06:19,419
Mother, we're off. Good-bye.

30
00:06:19,487 --> 00:06:21,978
Charlie, wait.

31
00:06:22,056 --> 00:06:23,990
- What?
- Is papa there?

32
00:06:24,058 --> 00:06:27,994
Wait a minute.
I've got some cherries.

33
00:06:49,851 --> 00:06:52,376
- About last night.
- Nothing happened.

34
00:06:54,488 --> 00:06:57,480
- I'm afraid I lost my head.
- Yes, we both did.

35
00:06:57,558 --> 00:07:01,494
Must've been the moonlight,
except there was no moon.

36
00:07:01,562 --> 00:07:04,224
Well, that's quite all right.

37
00:07:06,334 --> 00:07:08,734
- Do you mind?
- No.

38
00:07:15,176 --> 00:07:17,406
I have no money of my own...

39
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:20,470
and I have to make my way
in Nigeria.

40
00:07:20,548 --> 00:07:25,315
It's beastly there for a white woman,
with the climate, natives and all that.

41
00:07:27,088 --> 00:07:30,148
- I think you're a ripping girl.
- It's quite all right.

42
00:07:30,224 --> 00:07:32,385
No one knows about it.

43
00:07:33,527 --> 00:07:36,496
- Meg! I wrote to my sister.
- You didn't!

44
00:07:36,564 --> 00:07:40,022
Yes, I'm sorry.
She's sure to come. We must stop her.

45
00:07:40,101 --> 00:07:43,093
We'll send a telegram.
Crane's off sick.

46
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:46,571
- Isn't there a bicycle?
- Yes, there is somewhere.

47
00:07:56,117 --> 00:07:58,210
That'll be one and threepence 70,
sir.

48
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,848
M.j. Schlegel.
6 Wickham place.

49
00:08:01,923 --> 00:08:03,356
London, west.

50
00:08:04,892 --> 00:08:07,520
"Dear Meg. All over.

51
00:08:07,595 --> 00:08:11,588
Wish i'd never written.
Tell no one. Helen."

52
00:08:36,924 --> 00:08:40,485
Excuse me. I'm looking for somewhere
called howards house.

53
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:45,991
Mr. Wilcox, this lady
wants Howards End.

54
00:08:47,101 --> 00:08:51,197
Forgive my asking. Are you
the younger Mr. Wilcox or the elder?

55
00:08:51,272 --> 00:08:52,705
The younger.

56
00:08:54,241 --> 00:08:57,335
The station's unorganized. If I had
my way, the whole lot would be sacked.

57
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:59,936
- Thank you, bernard.
- Thank you, sir.

58
00:09:00,014 --> 00:09:03,814
I should introduce myself.
I am miss Schlegel's aunt.

59
00:09:03,884 --> 00:09:06,284
Rather. Yes, miss Schlegel's
stopping with us.

60
00:09:06,354 --> 00:09:08,686
- Do you want to see her?
- That would be very nice.

61
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:10,951
I could run you up.

62
00:09:18,232 --> 00:09:20,928
All the Schlegels are exceptional.

63
00:09:21,002 --> 00:09:23,197
They are british to the backbone...

64
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:25,636
but their father was german...

65
00:09:25,706 --> 00:09:28,675
and that is why they care for
literature and art.

66
00:09:28,743 --> 00:09:30,677
Just one minute.

67
00:09:35,383 --> 00:09:37,374
Wilcox, Howards End!

68
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:40,852
Know that I come
in no spirit of interference.

69
00:09:40,921 --> 00:09:43,583
I'm here to represent the family...

70
00:09:43,657 --> 00:09:47,093
and to talk to you about helen wilcox...

71
00:09:47,161 --> 00:09:49,288
my niece, and you.

72
00:09:49,363 --> 00:09:52,560
Miss Schlegel and myself?

73
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:54,794
I trust there's no misunderstanding.

74
00:09:54,869 --> 00:09:56,928
It's true I'm engaged to be married...

75
00:09:57,004 --> 00:09:59,700
but to another young lady,
not to miss Schlegel.

76
00:09:59,774 --> 00:10:03,232
Helen wrote to us.
She has told us everything.

77
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:06,609
Good god!
It's some foolery of Paul's!

78
00:10:07,681 --> 00:10:10,548
- But you are Paul.
- No, I'm not.

79
00:10:10,618 --> 00:10:13,109
- Why did you say so?
- I said nothing of the sort.

80
00:10:13,187 --> 00:10:16,918
- You did.
- I did not. My name is Charles.

81
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:21,121
You mean to tell me that Paul
and your niece have... the idiot!

82
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:24,123
Damn fool!

83
00:10:24,198 --> 00:10:26,723
Look, I warn you.

84
00:10:26,801 --> 00:10:29,429
It's useless.
Paul hasn't a penny.

85
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:32,939
No need to warn us.
The warning is all the other way.

86
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:37,103
He hasn't told us, but your niece
lost no time in publishing the news.

87
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:40,773
If I were a man, for that last remark
i'd box your ears.

88
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:43,009
You're not fit to sit in the same room
as my niece.

89
00:10:43,084 --> 00:10:45,609
- She spread the news, he hasn't.
- Or to clean her boots.

90
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:49,178
- Might I finish my sentence?
- No! I won't argue with such a person.

91
00:10:49,256 --> 00:10:51,520
Let me out of this car this instant.

92
00:10:51,592 --> 00:10:54,390
Don't stand up.
Sit down! Sit down!

93
00:10:54,462 --> 00:10:57,260
Just sit down!
Goodness sakes!

94
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:16,532
It will, I think,
be generally admitted...

95
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,976
that beethoven's fifth symphony...

96
00:12:19,046 --> 00:12:21,879
is the most sublime noise...

97
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:25,578
ever to have penetrated
the ear of man.

98
00:12:25,653 --> 00:12:28,087
But what does it mean?

99
00:12:28,155 --> 00:12:31,124
You can hardly fail to recognize
in this music...

100
00:12:31,192 --> 00:12:33,626
a mighty drama.

101
00:12:33,694 --> 00:12:37,357
The struggle of a hero
beset by perils...

102
00:12:37,431 --> 00:12:41,731
riding to magnificent victory
and ultimate triumph...

103
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:46,432
as described in the development section
of the first movement.

104
00:12:46,507 --> 00:12:51,444
I want to draw your attention
to the third movement.

105
00:12:51,512 --> 00:12:56,074
We no longer hear the hero,
but a goblin.

106
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,118
Thank you, mother.

107
00:13:00,854 --> 00:13:04,415
Single, solitary goblin...

108
00:13:04,491 --> 00:13:08,791
walking across the universe...

109
00:13:08,862 --> 00:13:10,853
from beginning to end.

110
00:13:16,637 --> 00:13:19,606
Why a goblin?

111
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:23,131
- I beg your pardon?
- Why a goblin?

112
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:24,973
It's obvious.

113
00:13:25,045 --> 00:13:27,878
The goblin signifies
the spirit of negation.

114
00:13:27,948 --> 00:13:31,611
But why specifically a goblin?

115
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:34,245
Panic and emptiness.
That is what...

116
00:13:34,321 --> 00:13:36,414
a goblin signifies.

117
00:13:49,903 --> 00:13:51,962
Miss!

118
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:54,132
Excuse me, miss,
but my umbrella.

119
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,613
Miss!

120
00:14:20,934 --> 00:14:22,367
Miss?

121
00:14:30,577 --> 00:14:33,375
Mrs. Wilcox never got
her wedding dress wet.

122
00:14:35,349 --> 00:14:37,283
Hurry up, Charles.

123
00:14:42,389 --> 00:14:44,323
In you go.

124
00:14:51,398 --> 00:14:54,026
Good-bye. See you there.

125
00:15:21,929 --> 00:15:24,227
Astonishing bad luck...

126
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:27,756
that in the whole of london
they could find no flat to rent...

127
00:15:27,835 --> 00:15:30,429
except the one bottled up
against our library window.

128
00:15:30,504 --> 00:15:32,597
Who could find no flat?

129
00:15:32,673 --> 00:15:36,006
Tibby, the wilcoxes.

130
00:15:36,076 --> 00:15:38,636
Surely you remember that business
last summer...

131
00:15:38,712 --> 00:15:40,942
with helen and Paul wilcox.

132
00:15:41,014 --> 00:15:42,606
Paul wilcox?

133
00:15:42,683 --> 00:15:45,675
The one I was expected to thrash
within an inch of his life?

134
00:15:47,254 --> 00:15:49,085
Oh, miss!

135
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:11,235
What is it?
Is Tibby ill?

136
00:16:11,311 --> 00:16:13,142
Tibby's making tea.

137
00:16:15,149 --> 00:16:17,617
Well, there's nothing worse than that.

138
00:16:17,751 --> 00:16:20,447
Now, helen...

139
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:23,012
something odd has happened.

140
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:25,081
Promise me you won't mind.

141
00:16:26,994 --> 00:16:28,928
It's the wilcoxes.

142
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:33,158
They've taken the flat opposite
for the wedding of their son.

143
00:16:33,233 --> 00:16:35,201
The other son.

144
00:16:39,573 --> 00:16:41,006
You do mind.

145
00:16:48,081 --> 00:16:52,245
Will Paul wilcox point and say, '; there
lives the girl who tried to catch me"?

146
00:16:52,319 --> 00:16:53,581
Ridiculous.

147
00:16:55,823 --> 00:16:58,815
They've only taken the flat
for a few weeks, the porter said.

148
00:17:02,496 --> 00:17:04,930
Do we bow or cut them dead?

149
00:17:06,133 --> 00:17:10,536
Darling, why don't you take up
cousin frieda's invitation...

150
00:17:10,604 --> 00:17:13,698
and go to hamburg
for those few weeks?

151
00:17:13,774 --> 00:17:15,708
I think I shall.

152
00:17:15,776 --> 00:17:18,210
Not that it matters, but...

153
00:17:18,278 --> 00:17:20,940
one wouldn't want
to keep bumping into wilcoxes.

154
00:17:25,285 --> 00:17:27,685
Don't hog all those scones, Tibby.

155
00:17:32,993 --> 00:17:35,587
Is that young man for us,
do you suppose?

156
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:39,896
He is for us.

157
00:17:45,672 --> 00:17:49,472
If you'll pardon me, miss.
You took my umbrella.

158
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:52,071
Inadvertently, I'm sure.

159
00:17:52,145 --> 00:17:55,774
At the ethical hall.
;'music and meaning."

160
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:58,715
I'm so sorry.

161
00:17:58,785 --> 00:18:02,277
I do nothing but steal umbrellas.
Come in and choose one.

162
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:06,158
Let's see.
Is yours a hooky or a knobbly?

163
00:18:06,226 --> 00:18:08,160
I think mine's a knobbly.

164
00:18:08,228 --> 00:18:13,256
That's Tibby's. How about this one?
You shouldn't open these indoors.

165
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:15,062
It's gone along the seams.

166
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:18,434
This is an appalling umbrella.
It must be mine.

167
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,473
I'm sorry.

168
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:24,743
Has my sister stolen your umbrella?

169
00:18:24,811 --> 00:18:28,508
Not again, helen. She is
an incorrigible thief. I am so sorry.

170
00:18:28,582 --> 00:18:31,210
Do stay for tea, Mr...

171
00:18:31,285 --> 00:18:33,276
- bast.
- Won't you stay for tea?

172
00:18:33,353 --> 00:18:35,378
Do stay for tea.

173
00:18:35,455 --> 00:18:37,480
It's the least we can do,
having made you all wet.

174
00:18:37,558 --> 00:18:39,526
Our brother's upstairs
to chaperone.

175
00:18:39,593 --> 00:18:43,256
- He's soaked, Meg. Please come up.
- Bring him upstairs.

176
00:18:45,232 --> 00:18:48,292
What did you think of the lecture?
I don't agree about goblins.

177
00:18:48,368 --> 00:18:50,393
But I do about the heroes
and shipwreck.

178
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:54,099
I'd always imagined a trail of elephants
dancing at that point.

179
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:57,337
He obviously didn't.
;'music and meaning," margaret.

180
00:18:57,411 --> 00:19:00,278
Does music have meaning,
of the literary kind, I mean?

181
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:02,440
- That's pure slush.
- We've a guest.

182
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:05,747
- Mr. Bast, take off your coat.
- Trust us with your umbrella.

183
00:19:05,819 --> 00:19:08,287
- Sit down.
- Have some tea.

184
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:10,619
How boring it would be
if it were only the score.

185
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:13,683
China tea? Only the score?
What an insidious omen.

186
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,126
We have other tea if you prefer.

187
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:17,720
Thank you.

188
00:19:17,798 --> 00:19:21,199
Here's some scones
that Tibby hasn't yet consumed.

189
00:19:28,775 --> 00:19:33,712
We're sorry to have inconvenienced you.
I hope you will come another day.

190
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,213
Would you?

191
00:19:36,617 --> 00:19:39,814
We should be so glad.
Do take our card.

192
00:19:39,886 --> 00:19:41,478
Thank you.

193
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:43,853
If you'll excuse me,
i must be going.

194
00:19:49,296 --> 00:19:52,993
I'll see you out. Are you sure
you don't want a spot for the journey?

195
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:56,194
No, thank you.
I must be going. Good-bye.

196
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:23,796
Why didn't you make
that young man welcome, Tibby?

197
00:20:25,198 --> 00:20:28,031
You must do the host a little,
you know.

198
00:20:29,169 --> 00:20:31,137
You could've coaxed him into stopping...

199
00:20:31,204 --> 00:20:34,401
instead of letting him be swamped
by screaming women.

200
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,024
Get your hot soup here!

201
00:20:54,094 --> 00:20:56,528
Hot soup! Lovely and warm.

202
00:21:03,937 --> 00:21:05,370
That you, len?

203
00:21:06,873 --> 00:21:09,899
Where have you been?

204
00:21:09,976 --> 00:21:12,410
- I'm off my head with worrying.
- About what?

205
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:15,073
- About you.
- Let go, jacky.

206
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:18,174
Every time I'm five minutes late,
you see me lying dead in the road...

207
00:21:18,251 --> 00:21:20,219
crushed and killed
in a gruesome accident.

208
00:21:20,287 --> 00:21:23,552
People do get killed in accidents
and don't come home no more.

209
00:21:23,623 --> 00:21:25,056
Anymore, jacky.

210
00:21:26,093 --> 00:21:29,688
I told you I was going to a lecture
on;'music and meaning."

211
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:33,459
I lost my umbrella.

212
00:21:33,533 --> 00:21:35,967
It's all right.
I got it back.

213
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:43,233
Have you had your tea?

214
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:45,369
I've cut you a bit
of tongue and jelly.

215
00:21:46,379 --> 00:21:47,812
Sure?

216
00:21:49,015 --> 00:21:50,607
I'll have it, then.

217
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:53,380
Funny, isn't it?

218
00:21:53,453 --> 00:21:56,013
Every time I worry,
i get starving hungry.

219
00:21:58,258 --> 00:22:01,193
Thoughts that go through my head!

220
00:22:01,261 --> 00:22:02,853
You'd laugh.

221
00:22:02,929 --> 00:22:04,863
You listening, len?

222
00:22:05,766 --> 00:22:07,734
Not only accidents...

223
00:22:07,801 --> 00:22:09,894
but you'll get wet in the rain.

224
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:12,063
- Did you?
- No.

225
00:22:12,139 --> 00:22:14,073
You said you lost your umbrella.

226
00:22:14,141 --> 00:22:18,510
I thought, "lord, he'll catch cold.
It'll go to his chest.

227
00:22:18,578 --> 00:22:20,842
Where's the money to come from
for the doctor?

228
00:22:20,914 --> 00:22:23,348
And what if he is in an accident...

229
00:22:23,416 --> 00:22:25,976
and they take him to the hospital
in the ambulance?

230
00:22:26,052 --> 00:22:28,782
- And him with holes in his socks."
- Hey, jacky!

231
00:22:28,855 --> 00:22:30,516
- I want to see.
- What?

232
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:33,525
- If there's holes in your socks.
- Stop it, jacky!

233
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:38,830
Len...

234
00:22:48,942 --> 00:22:50,409
come to bed.

235
00:22:50,477 --> 00:22:52,502
I'll finish this chapter.

236
00:23:02,189 --> 00:23:05,124
- You love your jacky?
- Let me read.

237
00:23:12,332 --> 00:23:16,735
Len, are you going to make it all right?

238
00:23:16,803 --> 00:23:19,738
You're not starting on that again.

239
00:23:19,806 --> 00:23:24,402
I've told you a hundred times,
we'll get married the day I'm 21.

240
00:23:24,477 --> 00:23:28,573
I'd do it before if my brother
wouldn't come and put a stop to it.

241
00:23:31,885 --> 00:23:34,183
What's it to him?
What's he ever done for me?

242
00:23:34,254 --> 00:23:37,280
That's right.
What's anyone ever done?

243
00:23:37,357 --> 00:23:39,154
It's just you and me.

244
00:23:39,226 --> 00:23:41,888
If you was to leave me,
i don't know what i'd do.

245
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:43,930
I truly don't.

246
00:23:47,601 --> 00:23:49,535
Now go to bed.

247
00:23:50,871 --> 00:23:52,896
You come, too.

248
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:54,463
Come on.

249
00:23:57,844 --> 00:23:59,277
Bookmarker.

250
00:23:59,346 --> 00:24:01,473
"Margaret Schlegel."

251
00:24:01,548 --> 00:24:04,176
And who is margaret Schlegel?

252
00:24:04,251 --> 00:24:06,344
A lady I met.

253
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:08,683
A lady. La-di-da.

254
00:24:08,755 --> 00:24:10,814
Come off it.
She's 100 years old.

255
00:24:10,891 --> 00:24:13,587
Says you.
So that's where you had your tea.

256
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:17,824
Nice cucumber sandwiches
cut ever so thin.

257
00:24:34,147 --> 00:24:37,708
"Ankle deep, he waded
through the bluebells.

258
00:24:37,784 --> 00:24:39,843
His spirit rose and exalted...

259
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:44,323
as he breathed in
the sun-drenched air.

260
00:24:44,391 --> 00:24:47,326
The glorious day
was in its last decline.

261
00:24:47,394 --> 00:24:50,090
Long shadows lay on the sward...

262
00:24:50,163 --> 00:24:54,827
and from above the leaves dripped their
shimmering drops of gold-green light.

263
00:24:56,069 --> 00:24:59,197
Moths and butterflies
swarmed in merry hosts...

264
00:24:59,272 --> 00:25:02,298
flittering here,
glimmering there.

265
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:05,469
But, hush.
Could that be a deer?"

266
00:25:55,996 --> 00:25:59,227
Oh, please, show her in.

267
00:26:09,409 --> 00:26:11,468
So sorry.

268
00:26:11,544 --> 00:26:14,513
Why, miss Schlegel.

269
00:26:14,581 --> 00:26:16,572
How kind of you to call.

270
00:26:16,649 --> 00:26:19,015
I wanted to for ever so long.

271
00:26:19,085 --> 00:26:22,646
But we haven't been here
for ever so long.

272
00:26:23,923 --> 00:26:25,356
Mrs. Wilcox...

273
00:26:26,826 --> 00:26:29,317
may i?

274
00:26:29,396 --> 00:26:32,160
All that business last summer
at Howards End...

275
00:26:32,232 --> 00:26:34,257
no, it goes further than that.

276
00:26:34,334 --> 00:26:37,167
Since we met at speyer.
Do you remember?

277
00:26:37,237 --> 00:26:39,762
That restored cathedral
that we all hated so.

278
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:43,832
What I remember principally
about speyer...

279
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:47,175
was the great pleasure
of meeting you, miss Schlegel.

280
00:26:49,182 --> 00:26:50,774
Helen's gone to germany.

281
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:54,251
And Paul's gone to nigeria.

282
00:26:56,890 --> 00:27:00,291
Now we can meet
because they can't.

283
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:03,386
It's no use beating about the bush.
What happened in the summer...

284
00:27:03,463 --> 00:27:06,091
was unfortunate for both of them,
don't you feel?

285
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:10,193
I'm sure you think the same way.
Because they should not meet.

286
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:11,703
Yes, I feel that.

287
00:27:11,771 --> 00:27:15,468
They belong to types that can fall
in love but can't live together.

288
00:27:15,542 --> 00:27:18,773
I'm afraid that in 8 cases out of 10...

289
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:21,177
nature pulls one way
and human nature the other.

290
00:27:24,717 --> 00:27:28,175
I do rattle on.
I shall tire you out in no time.

291
00:27:28,254 --> 00:27:32,486
It is true, I am not
particularly well today.

292
00:27:34,794 --> 00:27:37,319
But I'm so grateful for your visit.

293
00:27:37,397 --> 00:27:39,331
I'm quite alone.

294
00:27:39,399 --> 00:27:43,563
My husband and daughter have gone
on a motoring tour in yorkshire.

295
00:27:43,636 --> 00:27:47,834
And the young couple are on
their honeymoon. Charles and dolly.

296
00:27:47,907 --> 00:27:49,966
May I see? How lovely.

297
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:52,978
They've gone to naples.

298
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:57,176
- I can't imagine Charles in naples.
- Doesn't he like traveling?

299
00:27:57,250 --> 00:28:00,048
Yes, he likes travel.

300
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,680
But he does see through foreigners.

301
00:28:02,755 --> 00:28:07,192
What he would enjoy most
is a motor tour through england.

302
00:28:07,994 --> 00:28:10,861
Charles takes after me.

303
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:13,398
He truly loves england.

304
00:28:15,768 --> 00:28:19,966
Not, of course, london.
None of us love london.

305
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:25,543
It's so...

306
00:28:27,313 --> 00:28:31,249
it makes one feel so unstable,
impermanent...

307
00:28:32,652 --> 00:28:35,712
with the houses being torn down
on all sides.

308
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:41,887
Including,
in the foreseeable future, ours.

309
00:28:41,961 --> 00:28:45,362
- Are you having to leave wickham place?
- Yes.

310
00:28:45,431 --> 00:28:47,922
In 18 months when the lease expires.

311
00:28:48,001 --> 00:28:50,799
- Have you been there long?
- All our lives. We were born there.

312
00:28:53,673 --> 00:28:55,971
That is monstrous!

313
00:28:56,042 --> 00:28:58,169
I pity you from
the bottom of my heart.

314
00:28:58,244 --> 00:29:01,304
I had no idea this thing
was hanging over you.

315
00:29:01,381 --> 00:29:04,407
How dreadful!

316
00:29:04,484 --> 00:29:06,884
You poor girls.

317
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:09,148
Of course, we are fond of the house...

318
00:29:09,222 --> 00:29:11,986
but it is an ordinary London house.

319
00:29:12,058 --> 00:29:14,356
We shall easily find another.

320
00:29:14,427 --> 00:29:17,954
No, not in this world.

321
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:23,130
Not the house you were born in.

322
00:29:23,203 --> 00:29:26,331
You'll never find that again.
Poor, poor girls.

323
00:29:30,276 --> 00:29:32,972
Howards end was almost pulled down once.

324
00:29:33,046 --> 00:29:35,241
It would've killed me.

325
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:39,547
It's my house. It was left to me
by my brother who died in india.

326
00:29:40,486 --> 00:29:42,852
I love it so.

327
00:29:42,922 --> 00:29:45,948
I even resisted when henry,
my husband...

328
00:29:46,025 --> 00:29:48,755
wanted to make changes
to improve the property.

329
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:51,687
He knew best of course.

330
00:29:54,234 --> 00:29:56,896
We even have a garage...

331
00:30:01,541 --> 00:30:03,475
to the west of the house...

332
00:30:04,444 --> 00:30:08,244
just beyond the chestnut tree...

333
00:30:08,314 --> 00:30:10,282
in the paddock...

334
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:13,376
where the pony used to be.

335
00:30:13,453 --> 00:30:15,387
Where's the pony gone?

336
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:21,085
The pony? Dead, ever so long ago.

337
00:30:23,229 --> 00:30:27,996
The vice of the pan-german mind is that
it only cares for what it can use.

338
00:30:28,067 --> 00:30:31,662
- That is the vice of the imperial mind.
- The vice of the vulgar mind.

339
00:30:31,738 --> 00:30:35,868
But... and this is a tremendous;'but"...
they take poetry seriously.

340
00:30:35,942 --> 00:30:38,809
- They take poetry seriously.
- Is anything gained by that?

341
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:42,211
Yes! The germans
are always striving for beauty.

342
00:30:42,282 --> 00:30:46,514
Mrs. Wilcox, my father
was a german of the old school.

343
00:30:46,586 --> 00:30:48,520
A philosopher, an idealist.

344
00:30:48,588 --> 00:30:50,522
The countryman of hegel and kant.

345
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:53,320
Isn't that your father's sword
upstairs in the drawing room?

346
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:55,827
Yes. He was a soldier, too,
when he had to be.

347
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:58,557
He was so uncomfortable
about being on the winning side...

348
00:30:58,631 --> 00:31:01,361
he just hung up his sword
and never used it again.

349
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:06,531
My idea has always been...

350
00:31:09,208 --> 00:31:13,907
if we could bring the mothers...

351
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:18,144
of the various nations together...

352
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:22,054
there would be no more war.

353
00:31:23,589 --> 00:31:25,716
- Indeed, yes.
- Absolutely.

354
00:31:25,792 --> 00:31:28,659
If the mothers went to war,
there'd be no one left to defend.

355
00:31:29,595 --> 00:31:32,086
- Have another cutlet.
- Thank you.

356
00:31:32,165 --> 00:31:35,532
You are fortunate
in your cook.

357
00:31:35,601 --> 00:31:40,095
We have found it difficult to get
reliable servants in london.

358
00:31:40,173 --> 00:31:42,607
Servants have become
as unreliable as we are.

359
00:31:42,675 --> 00:31:45,667
And we can hardly expect them to listen
to radical discussions at the table.

360
00:31:45,745 --> 00:31:49,579
Annie does very well, don't you annie?
You're very patient with us.

361
00:31:49,649 --> 00:31:53,244
We never discuss at Howards End...

362
00:31:53,319 --> 00:31:55,253
except, perhaps, sport.

363
00:31:55,321 --> 00:31:58,688
But you should.
Discussion keeps a house alive.

364
00:31:58,758 --> 00:32:01,556
You will laugh
at my old-fashioned ideas.

365
00:32:01,627 --> 00:32:03,822
I will not.

366
00:32:03,896 --> 00:32:06,330
I sometimes think...

367
00:32:09,736 --> 00:32:13,137
it would be wiser to leave action
and discussion to men.

368
00:32:14,107 --> 00:32:16,337
Then where would we be
with the suffrage?

369
00:32:18,111 --> 00:32:22,309
L am only too thankful
not to have the vote myself.

370
00:32:28,287 --> 00:32:30,312
Shall we go up for coffee?

371
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:34,225
Will you lead the way?
Thank you.

372
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:52,675
What interesting lives you all lead.

373
00:32:52,745 --> 00:32:54,679
No, we don't.

374
00:32:55,948 --> 00:32:59,213
It's no use you pretending
you enjoyed lunch. You loathed it.

375
00:32:59,285 --> 00:33:01,685
But I hope you will forgive me...

376
00:33:01,754 --> 00:33:04,689
by coming again alone,
or by asking me to you.

377
00:33:04,757 --> 00:33:07,157
I enjoyed my lunch very much.

378
00:33:07,226 --> 00:33:10,389
Truly I did. I only wish
i could've joined in more.

379
00:33:12,932 --> 00:33:17,232
You're so clever, and yet so good.

380
00:33:18,971 --> 00:33:21,098
It's kind of you,
but I'm neither.

381
00:33:21,174 --> 00:33:24,234
You've been very good to me.
You've kept me from brooding.

382
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:26,938
I'm too apt to brood.

383
00:33:27,013 --> 00:33:28,446
About what?

384
00:33:29,449 --> 00:33:31,747
I really don't know.

385
00:33:33,686 --> 00:33:36,154
I think about my house a great deal.

386
00:33:37,123 --> 00:33:40,354
You've never seen Howards End.
I want to show it to you.

387
00:34:04,617 --> 00:34:08,314
Now, this is the scientific approach
to christmas shopping: A list.

388
00:34:08,387 --> 00:34:11,754
A list? What a good idea.

389
00:34:11,824 --> 00:34:14,793
Why don't you put your own name
at the top of the list?

390
00:34:14,861 --> 00:34:16,590
Hooray!

391
00:34:16,662 --> 00:34:21,258
How very kind of you
to start with me. Schlegel.

392
00:34:21,334 --> 00:34:23,768
Now next. Shall I put Mr. Wilcox?

393
00:34:46,092 --> 00:34:47,957
I know, these.

394
00:34:48,027 --> 00:34:50,018
What do you think of that?

395
00:34:50,096 --> 00:34:53,827
Oh, yes. Thank you very much.

396
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:57,666
- Good, I'm glad.
- You are wonderfully efficient.

397
00:34:57,737 --> 00:34:59,932
- Wrap that with a nice paper.
- Certainly.

398
00:35:00,006 --> 00:35:03,066
But your name still remains
at the top of the list.

399
00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:06,077
Yes. So, dolly.

400
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:09,546
I would like to give you something
worth your friendship.

401
00:35:12,018 --> 00:35:14,612
Couldn't you get it renewed?

402
00:35:15,521 --> 00:35:18,046
- I beg your pardon?
- The lease on your house.

403
00:35:18,124 --> 00:35:20,649
Have you been thinking of that?
How kind of you.

404
00:35:20,726 --> 00:35:24,218
- Surely something could be done.
- No, values have risen enormously.

405
00:35:24,297 --> 00:35:26,993
They mean to pull down wickham place
and build flats like yours.

406
00:35:27,066 --> 00:35:29,864
- But they're horrible.
- Landlords are horrible.

407
00:35:29,936 --> 00:35:32,404
And so are the flats they build.

408
00:35:32,471 --> 00:35:34,962
I fail to understand how people...

409
00:35:35,041 --> 00:35:37,805
can actually choose to live in them.

410
00:35:40,313 --> 00:35:42,304
There we are.

411
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:45,817
There we are. Thank you.

412
00:35:46,619 --> 00:35:48,553
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

413
00:35:57,129 --> 00:35:58,562
Thank you.

414
00:36:05,071 --> 00:36:07,904
I sorry. We shouldn't
have done this today.

415
00:36:07,974 --> 00:36:10,465
No, no.
We had to do it before.

416
00:36:11,277 --> 00:36:12,710
Before?

417
00:36:12,778 --> 00:36:15,110
Before my operation.

418
00:36:15,181 --> 00:36:19,277
I still haven't told my family yet.
Everyone hates illnesses.

419
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:23,355
That's as it should be.

420
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:27,852
There's a chestnut tree
at Howards End...

421
00:36:27,927 --> 00:36:30,896
that has pig's teeth
stuck into the trunk...

422
00:36:30,963 --> 00:36:34,091
about four feet from the ground.

423
00:36:34,166 --> 00:36:36,134
Yes, the teeth of a pig.

424
00:36:37,536 --> 00:36:40,334
The country people put them there
long ago...

425
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:43,739
and they think that if they chew
a piece of the bark...

426
00:36:45,511 --> 00:36:47,536
it will cure the toothache.

427
00:36:50,182 --> 00:36:52,116
I love folklore...

428
00:36:52,952 --> 00:36:54,886
and the old superstitions.

429
00:36:54,954 --> 00:36:57,320
Isn't it curious, though,
that unlike greece...

430
00:36:57,390 --> 00:36:59,324
england has no true mythology?

431
00:36:59,392 --> 00:37:01,826
All we have
are witches and fairies.

432
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:07,228
Will you come with me to Howards End?

433
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:12,635
- I would so much like to.
- Come with me now.

434
00:37:12,705 --> 00:37:16,937
- Now? It's too late...
- there's a train at 5:00 if we hurry.

435
00:37:17,009 --> 00:37:19,671
- I want you to see it.
- And I want to see it.

436
00:37:19,745 --> 00:37:22,680
It sounds such a glorious place,
so redolent.

437
00:37:22,748 --> 00:37:26,479
Yes. L lived there long before
i was married.

438
00:37:26,552 --> 00:37:28,952
I was born there.

439
00:37:29,021 --> 00:37:31,421
Might I come some other day?

440
00:37:33,426 --> 00:37:34,859
Yes.

441
00:37:36,662 --> 00:37:39,256
Some other day.

442
00:37:44,036 --> 00:37:47,403
Well, a thousand thanks, miss Schlegel,
for your help.

443
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:50,806
It is a comfort to have the presents
off my mind.

444
00:37:50,876 --> 00:37:53,242
The christmas cards especially.

445
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:55,542
I do admire your choice.

446
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:28,336
Mrs. Wilcox.

447
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:33,685
- I will come, if I still may.
- Return to hilton, please.

448
00:38:35,387 --> 00:38:38,117
You must stop the night, my dear.

449
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:40,852
It's in the morning
my house looks most beautiful.

450
00:38:40,926 --> 00:38:43,520
Two returns, please.

451
00:38:43,596 --> 00:38:45,029
Thank you.

452
00:38:46,065 --> 00:38:47,327
This is yours?

453
00:38:47,399 --> 00:38:51,597
I can't show you my meadow properly
except in sunlight.

454
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:55,003
It was so romantic.
It was in italy.

455
00:38:55,074 --> 00:38:57,838
Yes, and the two trains stopped
on either side.

456
00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:02,813
I opened the window and this man
handed a rose across.

457
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:05,146
I don't know where he got it.

458
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:07,515
- Was he italian?
- Yes, I think so. Italian.

459
00:39:07,586 --> 00:39:09,577
He'd have to be italian,
wouldn't he?

460
00:39:09,655 --> 00:39:12,818
- Mother!
- Evie!

461
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:16,384
- You never wrote. Look who I found.
- What are you doing here?

462
00:39:16,462 --> 00:39:21,399
We crashed the car. Are you going
to Howards End? Why? How are you?

463
00:39:21,467 --> 00:39:24,265
It's such a lovely surprise
I'm fit as a fiddle.

464
00:39:24,336 --> 00:39:28,136
- Do you remember miss Schlegel?
- Yes. How are you?

465
00:39:28,207 --> 00:39:31,472
We crashed the car in yorkshire.

466
00:39:31,544 --> 00:39:35,503
We must go home. You can't go
to Howards End. It's 10 to 5:00.

467
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:39,745
Miss Schlegel, I'm afraid our outing
will have to be another day.

468
00:39:39,819 --> 00:39:42,720
- Before I forget.
- There's a german expression with that.

469
00:39:44,857 --> 00:39:48,418
Yes. Not canceled but postponed.
Come home with us.

470
00:39:48,494 --> 00:39:51,827
No, no. Please. Good-bye.

471
00:39:52,498 --> 00:39:53,931
Till later.

472
00:39:54,834 --> 00:39:57,302
How lovely to see you.

473
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:13,043
I've been thinking of you.

474
00:40:15,888 --> 00:40:18,789
And of our meadow.

475
00:40:18,858 --> 00:40:20,758
Here.

476
00:40:24,496 --> 00:40:27,329
The day you are strong enough...

477
00:40:27,399 --> 00:40:29,890
i shall hold you to your promise.

478
00:41:20,152 --> 00:41:21,585
Oh, miss Schlegel.

479
00:42:42,501 --> 00:42:45,732
So, to repeat.
We have here...

480
00:42:45,804 --> 00:42:49,137
forwarded by the matron
of that nursing home...

481
00:42:49,208 --> 00:42:52,405
sealed and addressed to me...

482
00:42:52,478 --> 00:42:55,743
a note purporting
to be in your mother's handwriting.

483
00:42:55,814 --> 00:42:57,805
And it says...

484
00:42:57,883 --> 00:43:00,784
"i would like miss Schlegel,
margaret...

485
00:43:00,853 --> 00:43:03,321
to have Howards End."

486
00:43:03,389 --> 00:43:05,755
Mother never wrote that.

487
00:43:07,826 --> 00:43:10,192
No date.

488
00:43:10,262 --> 00:43:11,923
No signature.

489
00:43:11,997 --> 00:43:14,557
Of course.
It's a forgery.

490
00:43:17,236 --> 00:43:20,330
Not now. Later. Thank you.

491
00:43:22,241 --> 00:43:25,608
The house was your mother's
to leave to whom she wished.

492
00:43:26,879 --> 00:43:28,847
Let me see it.

493
00:43:32,384 --> 00:43:35,217
It's only in pencil.
Pencil never counts.

494
00:43:35,287 --> 00:43:39,246
Yes, we know it is not legally binding,
dolly. We are aware of that.

495
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:44,452
Of course, my dear, we consider you
as one of the family.

496
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:47,795
But it is better if you don't interfere
with what you don't understand.

497
00:43:49,201 --> 00:43:51,795
The question is...

498
00:43:51,870 --> 00:43:55,067
whether, during the time miss Schlegel
managed to befriend my mother...

499
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:57,472
I don't think this is a case
of undue influence.

500
00:43:57,543 --> 00:44:00,376
To my mind the question is...

501
00:44:00,446 --> 00:44:02,880
the invalid's condition
when the note was written.

502
00:44:02,948 --> 00:44:05,849
My dear father,
consult an expert if you wish...

503
00:44:05,918 --> 00:44:08,478
but I don't admit
it is my mother's handwriting.

504
00:44:08,554 --> 00:44:10,579
You just said it was.

505
00:44:10,656 --> 00:44:13,090
Never mind if I did.

506
00:44:15,894 --> 00:44:20,888
So we're all agreed that I would be
legally justified in tearing this up.

507
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,400
And all else aside...

508
00:44:24,470 --> 00:44:26,768
how is this gift to be conveyed
to miss Schlegel?

509
00:44:26,839 --> 00:44:29,637
Is she to have a life interest in it
or to own it absolutely?

510
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:33,144
She may be on her way down
this very minute to turn us all out.

511
00:44:34,613 --> 00:44:38,049
I don't believe miss Schlegel
knows anything about...

512
00:44:38,117 --> 00:44:39,846
this whim of your mother's.

513
00:44:41,286 --> 00:44:43,277
Mother believed so in ancestors.

514
00:44:43,355 --> 00:44:46,188
She would never have left anything
to an outsider.

515
00:44:46,258 --> 00:44:50,251
If miss Schlegel had been poor,
if she'd wanted a house...

516
00:44:51,763 --> 00:44:54,926
but she has a house.
Why should she want another?

517
00:44:58,470 --> 00:45:01,268
She wouldn't have wanted us
to even see this thing.

518
00:45:03,942 --> 00:45:06,968
Your poor mother
would not have wanted it.

519
00:45:46,084 --> 00:45:48,348
Len, you coming in?

520
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:50,183
In a minute.

521
00:45:50,255 --> 00:45:51,688
Right.

522
00:45:59,064 --> 00:46:01,089
What are you looking at?

523
00:46:01,166 --> 00:46:04,033
See that big one up there?
That's ursa major.

524
00:46:04,102 --> 00:46:06,093
Great bear.

525
00:46:06,171 --> 00:46:09,072
You follow those two down
about four times...

526
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:11,939
and that one there is the polestar,
I'm fairly certain.

527
00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:14,706
They're just stars.

528
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:16,714
Jacky, stop it.
It's important.

529
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:20,110
You'll catch your death.

530
00:46:50,549 --> 00:46:53,211
Excuse me, sir.
The policy.

531
00:46:53,285 --> 00:46:57,153
Yes, yes.
That's all signed.

532
00:47:18,010 --> 00:47:20,240
Would you read that?

533
00:47:20,312 --> 00:47:22,246
Yes, of course.

534
00:47:44,136 --> 00:47:47,367
"The trees reared
in mighty columns...

535
00:47:47,439 --> 00:47:49,839
their tops still radiant
in sunlight...

536
00:47:49,908 --> 00:47:54,311
which, spilling down,
went through the wealth of leaves...

537
00:47:54,379 --> 00:47:58,611
dissolved at last
in the darkness of the mossy earth.

538
00:48:00,152 --> 00:48:03,747
Their color slowly faded
from out of the flowers.

539
00:48:03,822 --> 00:48:07,690
But their scent lingered
to honey the air he breathed."

540
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:44,460
There's a woman to see you, ma'am.

541
00:48:44,529 --> 00:48:46,861
A woman and not a lady, annie?

542
00:48:46,932 --> 00:48:49,958
- She won't give her name.
- Ask her to come up.

543
00:48:50,035 --> 00:48:51,935
She says she won't come up.

544
00:48:52,904 --> 00:48:54,838
Then we shall have to go down.

545
00:49:01,913 --> 00:49:03,346
Good afternoon.

546
00:49:03,415 --> 00:49:05,576
- I'm looking for my husband.
- Here?

547
00:49:05,650 --> 00:49:07,242
Thank you, annie.

548
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:09,810
I have my reasons
to believe he is here.

549
00:49:10,689 --> 00:49:13,988
- You're welcome to search for him.
- I'm so sorry.

550
00:49:14,059 --> 00:49:18,086
- Your husband's name.
- Leonard bast, as I'm sure you're aware.

551
00:49:18,163 --> 00:49:20,631
Margaret, are we concealing
a Mr. Leonard bast?

552
00:49:23,568 --> 00:49:25,502
There appears to have been some mistake.

553
00:49:25,570 --> 00:49:28,164
I do not think we are acquainted
with your husband.

554
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,265
No, there's no mistake.

555
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:32,776
I know for a fact he has visited
in this house.

556
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:36,143
- He had his tea here.
- That is a grave allegation.

557
00:49:36,214 --> 00:49:39,206
Yes, to have corrupted a married man
with giving him tea.

558
00:49:39,284 --> 00:49:40,876
I wish we could help.

559
00:49:40,952 --> 00:49:43,079
It seems you can't...

560
00:49:43,155 --> 00:49:44,645
or won't...

561
00:49:44,723 --> 00:49:47,157
except to have a laugh
at my expense.

562
00:49:47,225 --> 00:49:51,628
I'm sorry to have troubled you,
and wish you a good afternoon.

563
00:49:56,968 --> 00:49:59,869
Do what you can for the house.
The drawing room reeks of smoke.

564
00:49:59,938 --> 00:50:02,202
With rita smoking, too,
the house might be more mousier.

565
00:50:02,274 --> 00:50:03,969
I doubt it.

566
00:50:04,042 --> 00:50:05,976
This is lovely.

567
00:50:06,044 --> 00:50:09,275
There's a Mr. Leonard bast.

568
00:50:09,347 --> 00:50:13,283
- It must be him.
- The one you corrupted with tea.

569
00:50:13,351 --> 00:50:15,876
- I'll do the host.
- Thank you.

570
00:50:15,954 --> 00:50:18,479
Mr. Bast, come this way.

571
00:50:18,557 --> 00:50:22,015
Do come in, Mr. Bast. Good evening.

572
00:50:22,093 --> 00:50:25,620
- Do come in and have pudding with us.
- Or would you prefer some dinner?

573
00:50:25,697 --> 00:50:27,892
- I've had my tea, thank you.
- Have a chair.

574
00:50:27,966 --> 00:50:29,957
Glass of wine? Port?

575
00:50:30,035 --> 00:50:31,468
No, thank you.

576
00:50:31,536 --> 00:50:35,302
Do take a seat, and let us know
how we can help you.

577
00:50:41,146 --> 00:50:44,513
You wouldn't remember giving me this?

578
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:47,746
- Not at the time.
- That was how it happened, you see.

579
00:50:47,819 --> 00:50:50,549
- How what happened?
- Where did we meet, Mr. Bast?

580
00:50:50,622 --> 00:50:52,180
I don't remember.

581
00:50:52,257 --> 00:50:56,284
It was more than a year ago
at the ethical society.

582
00:50:56,361 --> 00:50:58,295
The lecture was on;'music and meaning."

583
00:50:58,363 --> 00:51:01,059
I see. The mistake arose
out of my card, did it?

584
00:51:01,132 --> 00:51:05,068
The lady who called yesterday thought
you were calling too and would find you.

585
00:51:06,371 --> 00:51:08,498
In the afternoon, I said to my wife...

586
00:51:08,573 --> 00:51:11,736
i said to mrs. Bast,
"i have to pay a call on some friends."

587
00:51:11,810 --> 00:51:13,778
Mrs. Bast said to me, ;'do go."

588
00:51:13,845 --> 00:51:18,077
But while I was gone,
she wanted me on important business...

589
00:51:18,149 --> 00:51:20,879
and thought I had come here,
owing to the card.

590
00:51:20,952 --> 00:51:23,079
I tender my apologies, and hers...

591
00:51:23,154 --> 00:51:25,452
for any inconvenience
we may have caused.

592
00:51:25,524 --> 00:51:28,391
- None at all.
- I still don't understand.

593
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:31,554
When did you say you paid
this afternoon call?

594
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:33,928
In the afternoon, of course.

595
00:51:33,999 --> 00:51:35,933
Saturday afternoon or sunday?

596
00:51:37,002 --> 00:51:38,560
- Saturday.
- Really?

597
00:51:38,637 --> 00:51:41,902
And you were still calling on sunday
when your wife came here?

598
00:51:41,973 --> 00:51:43,565
A long visit.

599
00:51:43,642 --> 00:51:45,837
It was good of you to come and explain.

600
00:51:45,911 --> 00:51:48,175
The rest is no concern of ours.

601
00:51:48,246 --> 00:51:51,773
We are going upstairs for coffee.
I do hope you will join us.

602
00:51:53,552 --> 00:51:55,986
- Annie, pour the coffee.
- It's not what you think.

603
00:51:58,056 --> 00:51:59,489
I was...

604
00:52:00,825 --> 00:52:03,020
i left my office and walked.

605
00:52:03,795 --> 00:52:05,786
Right out of london.

606
00:52:05,864 --> 00:52:08,196
I was walking all saturday night.

607
00:52:08,266 --> 00:52:11,099
All night? In the dark?

608
00:52:11,169 --> 00:52:13,137
So dark I couldn't see my own hand.

609
00:52:13,204 --> 00:52:17,197
Mr. Bast, you must be
a born explorer.

610
00:52:18,610 --> 00:52:22,478
I tried to steer by polestar, but
everything gets mixed and I lost it.

611
00:52:22,547 --> 00:52:24,481
Don't tell me about polestar.

612
00:52:24,549 --> 00:52:27,484
It goes round and round,
and you go round with it.

613
00:52:36,094 --> 00:52:40,121
Yes, but why?
Why did you do it?

614
00:52:40,198 --> 00:52:43,998
I wanted to just walk.

615
00:52:44,069 --> 00:52:46,401
Just get out.

616
00:52:46,471 --> 00:52:48,439
I've been reading the ordeal
of richard feverel.

617
00:52:48,506 --> 00:52:50,997
I remember. There's that chapter
where richard walks all night.

618
00:52:51,076 --> 00:52:54,273
- In a forest by moonlight.
- What was that wonderful...

619
00:52:54,346 --> 00:52:57,008
i know exactly what you mean.

620
00:52:57,082 --> 00:53:00,882
"The forest drooped glimmeringly."

621
00:53:00,952 --> 00:53:02,783
Wait, I'll get it.

622
00:53:02,854 --> 00:53:05,049
The chapter's called;'nature speaks."

623
00:53:05,123 --> 00:53:08,820
- Where do your people come from?
- London.

624
00:53:08,893 --> 00:53:10,986
I know. I mean before that.

625
00:53:11,062 --> 00:53:14,088
They didn't always live in a town.

626
00:53:14,165 --> 00:53:16,531
No. They came
from around shropshire.

627
00:53:16,601 --> 00:53:18,535
They worked on the land.

628
00:53:18,603 --> 00:53:20,662
They were agricultural laborers.

629
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:25,073
There. You see?
It was ancestral voices calling you.

630
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:29,338
Here it is.

631
00:53:29,414 --> 00:53:31,882
;'richard was walking hurriedly.

632
00:53:31,950 --> 00:53:35,716
A pale gray light on the skirts of
the flying tempest displayed the dawn."

633
00:53:35,787 --> 00:53:38,221
- Did you see the dawn?
- Yes, suddenly it got light.

634
00:53:38,289 --> 00:53:40,086
- Was it wonderful?
- No.

635
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:46,256
It was only gray. By that time
i was so tired and hungry...

636
00:53:46,331 --> 00:53:50,859
i didn't know when you're walking,
you want breakfast, lunch and tea.

637
00:53:50,935 --> 00:53:52,562
All I had was a packet of woodbines.

638
00:53:56,608 --> 00:53:58,667
Give Mr. Bast money!

639
00:53:58,743 --> 00:54:00,574
We really must go.

640
00:54:00,645 --> 00:54:02,135
Meg, come on.

641
00:54:02,213 --> 00:54:05,376
Mr. Bast wouldn't know what to do
if you gave him money.

642
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:09,443
Nonsense. Money is educational,
more than the things it buys.

643
00:54:09,521 --> 00:54:11,785
Such crass materialism
out of your mouth.

644
00:54:11,856 --> 00:54:15,314
Give him money.
Let us give Mr. Bast money.

645
00:54:15,393 --> 00:54:19,227
What would it profit him if he gained
the whole world and lost his own soul?

646
00:54:19,297 --> 00:54:24,428
He won't gain his soul until he has
enough money. Give Mr. Bast money.

647
00:54:30,341 --> 00:54:32,206
Good-bye.

648
00:54:33,011 --> 00:54:34,444
Thank you.

649
00:54:49,728 --> 00:54:53,494
What do you think is
the most important thing in the world?

650
00:54:53,565 --> 00:54:58,434
I suppose it is whatever matters
to you most.

651
00:54:58,503 --> 00:55:03,406
- Like love, for instance?
- Like love or oxford, if you're Tibby.

652
00:55:03,475 --> 00:55:05,739
- Henry wilcox.
- Oh, hello!

653
00:55:05,810 --> 00:55:08,005
- Good evening.
- How nice to see you.

654
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:12,038
Wonderful surprise.
I heard you ladies talking of love.

655
00:55:12,117 --> 00:55:15,018
We were continuing
a serious discussion.

656
00:55:15,086 --> 00:55:20,217
Yes. We belong to a club which meets
once a week to discuss subjects.

657
00:55:20,291 --> 00:55:24,091
How are you? I would have thought
you'd be down at Howards End.

658
00:55:24,162 --> 00:55:26,790
Howards end is let.
We've bought a house in mayfair.

659
00:55:26,865 --> 00:55:29,265
Supposing you were a millionaire.

660
00:55:29,334 --> 00:55:31,802
But I expect you are one.

661
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:36,170
We have met a young man who is poor,
sensitive and intelligent.

662
00:55:36,241 --> 00:55:39,506
We wondered, if one was a millionaire,
how one could help him.

663
00:55:39,577 --> 00:55:42,341
- What's his profession?
- He's a clerk in...

664
00:55:42,413 --> 00:55:45,246
the porphyrion fire insurance company.

665
00:55:45,316 --> 00:55:47,750
- Porphyrion?
- Yes.

666
00:55:47,819 --> 00:55:52,552
Then, miss Schlegel,
if I were to help your young clerk...

667
00:55:52,624 --> 00:55:55,889
i'd advise him to clear out of
the porphyrion with all possible speed.

668
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:58,485
- Why?
- This is between friends, understand.

669
00:55:58,563 --> 00:56:02,761
The porphyrion will be in
the receivers' hands before christmas.

670
00:56:02,834 --> 00:56:04,825
In other words, it'll smash.

671
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:07,667
Do you hear?
Helen, the porphyrion will smash!

672
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:09,866
We must warn Mr. Bast
to get another place.

673
00:56:09,941 --> 00:56:11,568
I hope quickly.

674
00:56:11,643 --> 00:56:14,703
- But rather than wait to make sure?
- Decidedly.

675
00:56:14,779 --> 00:56:18,271
The man already in a situation
when he applies for work...

676
00:56:18,349 --> 00:56:20,476
stands a better chance.

677
00:56:20,552 --> 00:56:23,180
This is letting you
into state secrets...

678
00:56:23,254 --> 00:56:25,814
but it does affect an employer greatly.

679
00:56:25,890 --> 00:56:27,824
Human nature, I'm afraid.

680
00:56:27,892 --> 00:56:30,360
Our human nature
appears to be the other way.

681
00:56:30,428 --> 00:56:34,125
We employ people because
they're unemployed. The boot man.

682
00:56:34,199 --> 00:56:35,928
- How does he clean the boots?
- Not well.

683
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,729
There you are.

684
00:56:37,802 --> 00:56:40,965
Is it difficult for a clerk
to get a situation?

685
00:56:41,039 --> 00:56:44,099
- Yes, extremely.
- I'm so sorry about Howards End.

686
00:56:44,175 --> 00:56:47,872
That you're not living there.

687
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:51,609
I have some idea how much
her house meant to mrs. Wilcox.

688
00:56:51,683 --> 00:56:54,550
Yes, but to us, the family,
it has certain drawbacks.

689
00:56:54,619 --> 00:56:59,079
Would you be able to help our friend
to a new situation?

690
00:56:59,157 --> 00:57:03,253
Unfortunately we have
very few positions and vacancies.

691
00:57:03,328 --> 00:57:07,094
When there is one,
there's always hundreds of applicants.

692
00:57:07,165 --> 00:57:08,598
Of course.

693
00:57:08,666 --> 00:57:11,601
- It has been a pleasure.
- Yes, indeed.

694
00:57:11,669 --> 00:57:13,899
I hope your young clerk
finds success.

695
00:57:13,972 --> 00:57:15,940
Thank you. Good night.

696
00:57:17,575 --> 00:57:20,100
He was in a hurry to get away.

697
00:57:29,888 --> 00:57:35,087
Mr. Bast, I fear you may have thought
our letter a little odd.

698
00:57:35,159 --> 00:57:37,957
We're not odd,
just over expressive.

699
00:57:38,029 --> 00:57:41,692
The more a lady has to say, the better.
Ladies brighten every conversation.

700
00:57:41,766 --> 00:57:45,395
I know, the darlings
are regular sunbeams.

701
00:57:45,470 --> 00:57:49,065
Your company is the porphyrion,
isn't it?

702
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:51,074
Would you call it a solid concern?

703
00:57:51,142 --> 00:57:54,669
Cake? This big one
or one of these little deadlies?

704
00:57:54,746 --> 00:57:57,476
It depends what you mean by solid.

705
00:57:57,548 --> 00:57:59,880
We were told
the porphyrion's a no-go.

706
00:57:59,951 --> 00:58:04,718
A friend of ours did think
that it's insufficiently reinsured.

707
00:58:04,789 --> 00:58:08,657
- And advised you to clear out.
- You can tell your friend he's wrong.

708
00:58:08,726 --> 00:58:10,284
Oh, good!

709
00:58:11,562 --> 00:58:13,996
Wrong, so to speak.

710
00:58:14,065 --> 00:58:16,499
How, so to speak?

711
00:58:16,567 --> 00:58:18,762
I wouldn't say he was right altogether.

712
00:58:18,836 --> 00:58:20,929
Then he is right partly?

713
00:58:22,106 --> 00:58:25,200
Tell your friend
to mind his own business.

714
00:58:27,645 --> 00:58:30,409
Mr. Wilcox, miss wilcox.

715
00:58:32,517 --> 00:58:34,576
What a surprise!

716
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:39,822
- Pardon the intrusion.
- Mr. Wilcox, do come in.

717
00:58:39,891 --> 00:58:42,792
Please forgive us
for this unexpected visit.

718
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:46,057
Mr. Bast, come play
with the puppies.

719
00:58:46,130 --> 00:58:48,428
This is Mr. Bast.

720
00:58:48,499 --> 00:58:50,433
I must be going.

721
00:58:50,501 --> 00:58:53,527
- Must you really?
- Oh, come again.

722
00:58:53,604 --> 00:58:55,765
No, I shan't come again.

723
00:58:57,475 --> 00:59:01,605
I call that a very rude remark.
What do you want to turn on me for?

724
00:59:01,679 --> 00:59:05,012
I thought you invited me here
for a friendly chat.

725
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:07,745
Instead you want to pick my brains
about my place of business.

726
00:59:07,819 --> 00:59:10,344
Oh, yes, cross-question him,
pick his brains?

727
00:59:11,723 --> 00:59:14,487
Are we intruding?
Shall we go?

728
00:59:15,893 --> 00:59:18,327
Helen, go after him. Explain.

729
00:59:24,836 --> 00:59:26,895
What was all that about?

730
00:59:26,971 --> 00:59:30,907
I shouldn't have come. Before was all
right, but things like that get spoiled.

731
00:59:30,975 --> 00:59:33,466
Things do, but people don't!

732
00:59:33,544 --> 00:59:37,344
Don't you understand? We really did
want to warn you about the porphyrion.

733
00:59:37,415 --> 00:59:39,508
We were worried about you.

734
00:59:39,584 --> 00:59:41,552
Why should you worry about me?

735
00:59:41,619 --> 00:59:45,385
Because we like you!
That's why!

736
00:59:47,191 --> 00:59:50,456
- You noodle.
- No cause to call a person names.

737
00:59:50,528 --> 00:59:54,225
There is when a person
is being tremendously stupid.

738
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:57,898
Listen, this is serious.

739
00:59:57,969 --> 01:00:02,372
Our friend said you should look for
another post before anything happens.

740
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:04,908
- Will you?
- I'll think about it.

741
01:00:04,976 --> 01:00:10,539
You must do more. You must search for
another place while you still have one.

742
01:00:10,615 --> 01:00:15,177
Promise you'll do that at least?
Please!

743
01:00:15,253 --> 01:00:16,914
Ali right.

744
01:00:16,988 --> 01:00:18,956
Thank you, miss Schlegel.

745
01:00:20,224 --> 01:00:23,284
Come and tell us when you've found
another place. Or just come anyway.

746
01:00:23,361 --> 01:00:26,524
Don't say no.
Don't dare to say no!

747
01:00:27,598 --> 01:00:30,658
And don't forget your umbrella
or you'll say we pinched it.

748
01:00:39,277 --> 01:00:43,407
You ought to be more careful. Your
servants should not let such people in.

749
01:00:43,481 --> 01:00:45,608
But we invited him in.

750
01:00:45,683 --> 01:00:49,346
We wanted to see him again,
talk to him and maybe help him.

751
01:00:49,420 --> 01:00:51,615
Not only in a practical way.

752
01:00:51,689 --> 01:00:55,455
You're too kind. You behave too well
to people, and then they impose on you.

753
01:00:55,526 --> 01:00:57,892
I know the world and that type of man.

754
01:00:57,962 --> 01:00:59,793
But he is not a type.

755
01:00:59,864 --> 01:01:04,927
No. He is a quite unusual young man.
And he has something in him.

756
01:01:05,002 --> 01:01:09,166
I don't know what it is except he wants
something better than he's got.

757
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:11,640
- Oh.
- Yes.

758
01:01:11,709 --> 01:01:13,768
He has romantic ambition.

759
01:01:15,146 --> 01:01:18,582
It is your view of him
that is romantic.

760
01:01:24,388 --> 01:01:27,016
We wish you to have something
to remember mrs. Wilcox by...

761
01:01:27,091 --> 01:01:29,286
in return for your kindness.

762
01:01:30,394 --> 01:01:32,419
Oh, thank you so much.

763
01:01:32,497 --> 01:01:34,465
What a lovely thought.
Thank you.

764
01:01:34,532 --> 01:01:37,092
She would want you to have it.
She spoke very fondly of you.

765
01:01:37,168 --> 01:01:40,467
It's beautifull
are you sure?

766
01:01:40,538 --> 01:01:43,268
Is it 18th century?
Must be crystal.

767
01:01:43,341 --> 01:01:45,366
Thank you.
Thank you, evie.

768
01:01:48,412 --> 01:01:50,039
What's she look like?

769
01:01:50,114 --> 01:01:53,345
An old maid type. Goodness knows
why father wanted me to ask her.

770
01:01:53,417 --> 01:01:55,351
She talks and talks...
here she is.

771
01:01:55,419 --> 01:01:58,286
- Miss Schlegel.
- Miss wilcox.

772
01:01:58,356 --> 01:02:01,052
How do you do?
This is my fiance percy cahill.

773
01:02:01,125 --> 01:02:02,558
How do you do?

774
01:02:03,961 --> 01:02:08,625
- Ah, good afternoon!
- Hello. I didn't expect to see you.

775
01:02:08,699 --> 01:02:13,227
Evie told me of her little plot,
so I secured a table. Evie, sit there.

776
01:02:13,304 --> 01:02:15,795
Miss Schlegel, if you please here.

777
01:02:15,873 --> 01:02:17,807
Mr. Cahill, there.

778
01:02:19,143 --> 01:02:22,943
Are you still worrying around
after your young clerks?

779
01:02:23,014 --> 01:02:25,676
- I hope you're hungry.
- Famished. I want to eat heaps.

780
01:02:25,750 --> 01:02:27,718
Good. What will you have?

781
01:02:27,785 --> 01:02:30,652
Fish pie.

782
01:02:30,721 --> 01:02:34,213
Fancy coming for fish pie to simpson's.
It's not a fit thing to go for here.

783
01:02:34,292 --> 01:02:36,954
- Go for something for me then.
- Right.

784
01:02:38,362 --> 01:02:42,799
Roast beef and yorkshire pudding
and cider to drink.

785
01:02:42,867 --> 01:02:45,131
That's the type of thing to go for.

786
01:02:45,203 --> 01:02:49,572
I like this place. It's so thoroughly
old english. Don't you agree?

787
01:02:52,176 --> 01:02:54,508
I began an inventory of our possessions.

788
01:02:54,579 --> 01:02:58,276
There are over 300 things
in the drawing room alone. Thank you.

789
01:02:58,349 --> 01:03:01,841
And that's not counting the books!
Whatever shall I do?

790
01:03:01,919 --> 01:03:06,982
The modern ownership of movables
is reducing us to a nomadic horde.

791
01:03:07,058 --> 01:03:10,221
We are averting
to a civilization of luggage.

792
01:03:11,495 --> 01:03:13,156
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

793
01:03:13,231 --> 01:03:16,530
Always tip the carver.
'; tip everybody" is my motto.

794
01:03:16,601 --> 01:03:20,037
- Perhaps it does make life more human.
- And these fellows remember one again.

795
01:03:20,104 --> 01:03:22,698
Especially in the east. If you tip,
they'll remember you from year to year.

796
01:03:22,773 --> 01:03:25,571
- Have you been in the east?
- Yes. Greece, livanatai.

797
01:03:25,643 --> 01:03:28,510
I used to go for sport
and business to cyprus.

798
01:03:28,579 --> 01:03:31,104
A few piastres help
to keep one's memory green.

799
01:03:31,182 --> 01:03:32,843
How shockingly cynical.

800
01:03:32,917 --> 01:03:35,385
Not a bit.
Simply realistic.

801
01:03:35,453 --> 01:03:37,887
- How would you like your meat?
- Well-done.

802
01:03:40,224 --> 01:03:43,193
You don't like cheese.
You never take cheese.

803
01:03:43,261 --> 01:03:45,252
- I adore cheese.
- You said you didn't.

804
01:03:45,329 --> 01:03:48,924
That's the most despicable lie.
You've grown quite pink.

805
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,992
- I haven't.
- Your ears are pink about the tips.

806
01:03:52,069 --> 01:03:53,502
I like that.

807
01:03:53,571 --> 01:03:56,233
Miss Schlegel expects me to act
as house agent for her.

808
01:03:57,475 --> 01:04:00,273
I want a new home in september,
and someone must find it. I can't.

809
01:04:00,344 --> 01:04:02,278
Do you know of anything, percy?

810
01:04:02,346 --> 01:04:04,007
Can't say I do.

811
01:04:04,081 --> 01:04:06,413
I wish you would give us
Howards End.

812
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:10,785
I'm afraid it's let.

813
01:04:10,855 --> 01:04:13,323
Can't you turn out your tenant,
let it to us?

814
01:04:17,361 --> 01:04:19,556
We're nearly demented.

815
01:04:19,630 --> 01:04:22,292
Mr. Wilcox, I am demented.

816
01:04:23,334 --> 01:04:25,268
One bit of advice.

817
01:04:25,336 --> 01:04:28,499
Fix your district, fix your price,
then don't budge.

818
01:04:28,572 --> 01:04:31,541
That's how I got ducie street
and oniton.

819
01:04:31,609 --> 01:04:33,167
I shall...

820
01:04:34,845 --> 01:04:36,779
i shall look around for you.

821
01:04:38,149 --> 01:04:40,447
- Would you?
- Yes.

822
01:04:40,518 --> 01:04:43,487
Would you really?
How kind!

823
01:04:43,554 --> 01:04:48,218
I warn you, the house has not been built
that would suit the Schlegel family.

824
01:04:48,292 --> 01:04:50,226
It's no fun trying to help us.

825
01:04:50,294 --> 01:04:53,058
Fun? No, but a pleasure
and a privilege...

826
01:04:53,130 --> 01:04:55,655
to do whatever I can
for miss margaret Schlegel.

827
01:04:57,768 --> 01:05:00,259
Thank you very much.

828
01:05:00,338 --> 01:05:02,602
"Dear miss Schlegel...

829
01:05:02,673 --> 01:05:07,007
dare I intrude on your holiday
and request you to come up to london?

830
01:05:07,078 --> 01:05:09,512
Where, I may add,
you are greatly missed.

831
01:05:09,580 --> 01:05:11,548
Matter is of some urgency."

832
01:05:12,750 --> 01:05:15,685
But to interrupt your holiday!

833
01:05:15,753 --> 01:05:18,449
And before we have undertaken
any of our excursions.

834
01:05:18,522 --> 01:05:21,082
You haven't even been
to nine barrows down.

835
01:05:21,158 --> 01:05:23,888
I know, but I shall be back
before long.

836
01:05:23,961 --> 01:05:28,364
Let me go up to town today,
and take the house if it's possible.

837
01:05:28,432 --> 01:05:30,366
Whose house is this?

838
01:05:30,434 --> 01:05:34,461
Mr. Wilcox's.
Are you being obtuse on purpose?

839
01:05:34,538 --> 01:05:36,836
Look. ;'owing to changed circumstances..."

840
01:05:36,907 --> 01:05:39,375
he means that evie's getting married.
That's his daughter.

841
01:05:39,443 --> 01:05:42,207
"I no longer have need
for a london house of this size...

842
01:05:42,279 --> 01:05:44,873
and am willing to let it
on a yearly tenancy."

843
01:05:44,949 --> 01:05:46,416
It's perfect.

844
01:05:46,484 --> 01:05:49,419
Out of all our acquaintances,
Mr. Wilcox is the only one who stuck...

845
01:05:49,487 --> 01:05:51,921
and yet we've met
far more interesting people.

846
01:05:51,989 --> 01:05:54,617
Interesting people
don't get one houses.

847
01:05:54,692 --> 01:05:59,095
I shall never forget that dreadful
motor drive with that dreadful Charles.

848
01:05:59,163 --> 01:06:03,259
My one consolation is that I was able
to be useful to you girls.

849
01:06:03,334 --> 01:06:05,199
Thank you, aunt Juley.

850
01:06:06,971 --> 01:06:09,735
And now it is my turn to be useful.

851
01:06:45,242 --> 01:06:47,369
This is the ballroom.

852
01:06:47,445 --> 01:06:48,935
Goodness!

853
01:06:50,581 --> 01:06:52,549
- Like it?
- Rather!

854
01:06:53,451 --> 01:06:56,909
Even I know a good thing
when I see it.

855
01:06:59,457 --> 01:07:04,258
Yes, but nowadays with
evie always out with her fiance...

856
01:07:04,328 --> 01:07:07,456
when I get home in the evenings,
i can't stand the place.

857
01:07:07,531 --> 01:07:10,329
- It would be very lonely for you.
- Yes.

858
01:07:12,269 --> 01:07:14,237
Do you ever get lonely?

859
01:07:14,305 --> 01:07:16,296
I soon shall horribly.

860
01:07:17,741 --> 01:07:20,710
It's heartbreaking to leave
one's old home.

861
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:24,809
Goodness! How high
this ceiling must be.

862
01:07:26,417 --> 01:07:30,877
Yes, it must be over 30 feet.
No, maybe 40, I should think.

863
01:07:30,955 --> 01:07:32,889
Perhaps even more.

864
01:07:39,563 --> 01:07:42,031
I've had you up here
on false pretenses.

865
01:07:42,099 --> 01:07:45,034
I want to speak on a much more
serious matter than the house.

866
01:07:50,875 --> 01:07:55,539
Do you think you could
be induced to share...

867
01:07:55,746 --> 01:07:57,976
i mean, is it at all probable...

868
01:07:58,048 --> 01:08:00,482
oh, yes, I see.

869
01:08:06,257 --> 01:08:07,519
Miss Schlegel...

870
01:08:09,193 --> 01:08:12,993
margaret, I don't think
you quite understand.

871
01:08:13,063 --> 01:08:14,997
Oh, yes, indeed yes.

872
01:08:15,065 --> 01:08:19,593
- I'm asking you to be my wife.
- Yes, I know. I know.

873
01:08:20,671 --> 01:08:23,663
- Are you offended?
- How could I be?

874
01:08:23,741 --> 01:08:25,732
Perhaps I should have written first.

875
01:08:25,809 --> 01:08:29,370
No! Rather you will receive
a letter from me.

876
01:08:29,446 --> 01:08:33,382
- Thank you.
- Not at all. And it's you I thank.

877
01:08:38,923 --> 01:08:41,483
Should I order the motor around now?

878
01:08:43,561 --> 01:08:45,825
That would be most kind.

879
01:09:12,723 --> 01:09:15,988
I am warning you, evie,
she will never set foot in this house.

880
01:09:16,060 --> 01:09:19,496
- It's not my fault!
- Of course it's your fault.

881
01:09:19,563 --> 01:09:23,021
Going around hobnobbing
with those Schlegel girls.

882
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:25,034
They're hardly girls.

883
01:09:25,102 --> 01:09:27,332
L never dreamt of such a thing.

884
01:09:27,404 --> 01:09:31,397
Dad took me to call,
and made me ask her to simpson's.

885
01:09:31,475 --> 01:09:33,238
I'm altogether off dad.

886
01:09:33,310 --> 01:09:36,473
You've woken diddums.
I knew you would.

887
01:09:36,547 --> 01:09:41,007
Well, miss Schlegel's fairly
got us on toast.

888
01:09:41,085 --> 01:09:44,452
She always meant to get hold
of Howards End.

889
01:09:44,521 --> 01:09:47,456
Now, thanks to you,
she's got it.

890
01:09:47,524 --> 01:09:49,856
I call that most unfair.

891
01:09:49,927 --> 01:09:53,192
Evie, why don't you pretend
to break off your engagement?

892
01:09:53,263 --> 01:09:56,289
Then perhaps your father
will also quarrel with miss Schlegel.

893
01:09:56,367 --> 01:09:57,959
Stop talking nonsense.

894
01:09:58,035 --> 01:10:02,631
I'll get married as soon as possible,
and dad can do what he likes.

895
01:10:02,706 --> 01:10:06,904
Taking mother's place.
The idea!

896
01:10:06,977 --> 01:10:10,640
I could scratch
that woman's eyes out.

897
01:10:10,714 --> 01:10:12,409
Tootle, tootle.

898
01:10:12,483 --> 01:10:16,715
Come on, dolly, I'll have a try.

899
01:10:16,787 --> 01:10:19,221
It's no use talking.

900
01:10:19,289 --> 01:10:23,316
We're in a bad hole,
and must make the best of it.

901
01:10:23,394 --> 01:10:26,124
But I'll keep my eye
on those Schlegels.

902
01:10:27,197 --> 01:10:31,600
And if I find them putting on airs
with their artistic beastliness...

903
01:10:32,970 --> 01:10:34,995
i intend to put my foot down.

904
01:10:35,072 --> 01:10:37,632
Yes. Firmly.

905
01:10:53,857 --> 01:10:58,317
I've had a letter, too. Not a nice one.
I want to talk it over with you.

906
01:10:58,395 --> 01:11:02,195
My letter's about Howards End.
The tenants have decamped.

907
01:11:02,266 --> 01:11:07,397
What is worse,
he's trying to sublet the house.

908
01:11:07,471 --> 01:11:09,962
What are you laughing at?

909
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:13,100
You haven't had a chance to talk
with helen yet, have you?

910
01:11:13,177 --> 01:11:15,873
- A talk with her?
- Well, do before you go.

911
01:11:15,946 --> 01:11:19,279
- What's the matter?
- I'm anxious you two should be friends.

912
01:11:20,284 --> 01:11:23,651
We've always hit it off together.
We do.

913
01:11:23,721 --> 01:11:27,418
There's no clause in the agreement
to allow subletting. Read it yourself.

914
01:11:27,491 --> 01:11:29,459
- That's awfully jolly.
- Thank you.

915
01:11:29,526 --> 01:11:31,357
Yes, especially that.

916
01:11:31,428 --> 01:11:33,919
- Foxgloves.
- Yes, dear old digitalis.

917
01:11:33,997 --> 01:11:36,625
Digitalis.
Sounds like a sneeze.

918
01:11:38,535 --> 01:11:42,096
- Margaret, such nice news from Mr. Bast!
- Really?

919
01:11:42,172 --> 01:11:45,403
Good. Here we all are, then.

920
01:11:45,476 --> 01:11:48,968
Mr. Bast is now with dempster's bank.
That's his news.

921
01:11:49,046 --> 01:11:52,311
Thanks to your hint,
he cleared out of the porphyrion.

922
01:11:52,382 --> 01:11:54,850
Not a bad business, the porphyrion.

923
01:11:54,918 --> 01:11:59,252
I shall have to go to Howards End
and take charge. I'd like you to come.

924
01:11:59,323 --> 01:12:01,621
- Not a bad business?
- I would like that very much.

925
01:12:01,692 --> 01:12:05,560
- Good. What about tomorrow?
- Tomorrow? I couldn't well do that.

926
01:12:05,629 --> 01:12:07,961
You told us the porphyrion
would smash before christmas.

927
01:12:08,031 --> 01:12:12,092
Did i? Yes, it was outside
the tariff ring at the time.

928
01:12:12,169 --> 01:12:14,103
Took some rather bad policies.

929
01:12:14,171 --> 01:12:18,972
Lately it came in. Safe as houses now.
What's wrong with tomorrow?

930
01:12:19,042 --> 01:12:21,306
Aunt Juley would be so disappointed
if I left now.

931
01:12:21,378 --> 01:12:25,906
- Didn't Mr. Wilcox clearly tell us...
- yes. Let's talk about it later.

932
01:12:25,983 --> 01:12:27,917
Aunt Juley regards this...

933
01:12:27,985 --> 01:12:32,149
now it turns out it's safe as houses,
and Mr. Bast should never have left...

934
01:12:32,222 --> 01:12:34,156
at a greatly reduced salary.

935
01:12:34,224 --> 01:12:37,853
My dear helen, I grieve
for your clerk. I really do.

936
01:12:37,928 --> 01:12:40,089
But it is part of the battle of life.

937
01:12:40,164 --> 01:12:43,793
Battle of life? A man who had
little money has less, owing to us.

938
01:12:43,867 --> 01:12:46,734
Come, come. You're not to blame.
No one is to blame.

939
01:12:46,804 --> 01:12:50,171
- Is no one to blame for anything?
- I didn't say that.

940
01:12:51,171 --> 01:13:01,171
