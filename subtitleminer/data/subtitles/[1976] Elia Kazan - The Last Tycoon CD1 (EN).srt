1
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,236
l'll be waiting for you there...

2
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,500
in about one hour.

3
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:48,747
You can trust me.

4
00:00:56,656 --> 00:00:57,782
Ah, signora.

5
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,484
Grazie.

6
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:16,170
Che cosa?

7
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:18,972
Go on.
Go on!

8
00:01:34,961 --> 00:01:36,553
The end is too gory.

9
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:37,858
Cut out one roll of the table.

10
00:01:37,897 --> 00:01:38,864
Okay.

11
00:01:38,898 --> 00:01:40,126
The signal was much too obvious.

12
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:41,724
lt kills the surprise.
Make it shorter.

13
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:42,757
Okay, Monroe.

14
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:43,996
What else?

15
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:46,130
You wanted to see the beach
scene from Dark Moonlight.

16
00:01:46,172 --> 00:01:47,196
Right.

17
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,730
Okay, Jack.

18
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:55,277
No, no, don't go to him at all,
stay on her.

19
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:59,014
You don't need him. Stay on her

20
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,780
all the way down
to the edge of the sea.

21
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,549
She's the one
we're interested in.

22
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:05,854
Remember that scene
from Reaching for the Moon,

23
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:11,091
when Bebe Daniels ran out of
the house, down to the lake?

24
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,962
This is where we shot it.

25
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:15,694
No, of course
you wouldn't remember,

26
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:16,963
you're too young.

27
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,970
l've been here
since the silent days.

28
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:20,267
l knew them all.

29
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:21,466
Did you know the Keystone Kops?

30
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:22,475
All of them!

31
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:23,942
What a bunch of guys.

32
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:27,313
Shh.

33
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:35,487
This was Minna Davis'
dressing room.

34
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:43,793
She was taken ill
for the last time...

35
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,627
in this room.

36
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,633
That's her.

37
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,501
She was beautiful.

38
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:54,905
She was a great friend of mine.

39
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:57,842
l remember we had
to call her husband.

40
00:02:57,877 --> 00:03:01,404
l called him myself.

41
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:04,280
l remember that call well.

42
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:08,549
l said, "Mr. Stahr...

43
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:10,715
l'm afraid your wife
has been taken ill."

44
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:13,620
He said, "l'll be right over."

45
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:17,920
And this is where
it all happened.

46
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:22,234
This is where Mr. Stahr was
when l called him.

47
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:25,203
The administration building.

48
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:26,830
That's where he still is.

49
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:29,068
That's his office up there.

50
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:30,666
Oh...

51
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,907
Gee, it's so big!

52
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:35,778
lt's big, all right.

53
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:38,784
They don't have anything bigger
in the whole world.

54
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:41,480
How did they do the earthquake
in San Francisco?

55
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:42,613
The earthquake?

56
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:45,351
Well, there are various ways
you can do an earthquake.

57
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:48,656
What you can do first is
rock the camera.

58
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:49,662
You see?

59
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:53,325
Or if you're in a room,
you can rock the set.

60
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:55,163
l mean, you can rock the room.

61
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:56,998
Then you throw in
a lot of dust...

62
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:01,598
No, l wasn't asleep.

63
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:04,075
When are you coming home?

64
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,077
Mmm.

65
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:06,578
Oh, l'm all right.

66
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:08,581
l miss you, that's all.

67
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:10,606
Oh, she's with her grandmother.

68
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:11,947
She's fine.

69
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:13,610
She has a new tooth.

70
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:14,620
Mmm.

71
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:16,622
How did it go?

72
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:17,748
Oh, that's good.

73
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:18,757
Mmm...

74
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,486
When are you coming home?

75
00:04:22,695 --> 00:04:24,287
Oh... good.

76
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:25,524
Beautiful baby.

77
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:27,931
And you want me to meet you?

78
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:29,400
Mmm.

79
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,370
Next time
l'll be coming with you.

80
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:33,667
Come on, come on.

81
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:37,836
They owe me a little time off
at the club anyway.

82
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:38,866
Oh...

83
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:42,074
Couldn't be more boring
than being without you.

84
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,640
Yes, me too.

85
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:46,276
Bye, darling.

86
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:00,566
Want me to go?

87
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,726
Yes!

88
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,237
No.

89
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:14,747
Cut!

90
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:15,748
Kill the arc.

91
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:16,908
That's a print.

92
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:17,938
That was really good.

93
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:19,950
l mean, very good.

94
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:21,247
Give me a finder.

95
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:23,448
All right, take it up.

96
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:24,854
Your aspirin, sir.

97
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:28,754
Strike the sofa!

98
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:31,525
Pick up the phone, Harry.

99
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:38,803
Pull the phone back, Fred.

100
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,362
And watch
that cable!

101
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:41,873
Makeup!

102
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:43,398
That was really
very good indeed.

103
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:44,410
Makeup!

104
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:45,433
You think so?

105
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:46,945
lt was absolutely terrific.

106
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:48,378
lt was really wonderful.

107
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:49,506
lt was shit.

108
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:52,982
Here we go again, Billy.

109
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:53,986
Listen, Didi,

110
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:56,248
l have to tell you
it was exquisite.

111
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:58,519
lt was fake.

112
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:00,287
lt was false.

113
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:01,759
Didn't you notice?!

114
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:10,329
l want to do it again.

115
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,270
You'll never do it better.

116
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:14,671
l know l can play
that scene.

117
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:16,698
l want to do it again.

118
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:17,732
lt was good for me.

119
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:19,074
What?

120
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:21,437
Didi...

121
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:23,415
trust me.

122
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,352
Thank you.

123
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,391
l'm ready.

124
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:45,863
Chief?

125
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,032
Let's do it again.

126
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:50,434
We're going to do it again.

127
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:51,443
Bitch.

128
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:52,603
Get it quiet now, damn it!

129
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:53,873
All right, bring it down.

130
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,403
Quiet! Quiet, damn it!

131
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:04,723
Good night, Frank.

132
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:05,724
Good night, Brian.

133
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,350
Yo.

134
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:14,194
Harry, l'm waiting!

135
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:16,602
Night, boys.

136
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:17,864
Night. See you tomorrow, Hank.

137
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:19,337
- Goodnight. Bye.
- See you tomorrow.

138
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:27,312
l love him.

139
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,416
He's a genius.

140
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,152
l've always wanted him to get
every credit.

141
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:34,148
You know that.

142
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:37,712
But what about me?

143
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:39,520
New York has forgotten me.

144
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:40,526
No, no...

145
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,858
New York has forgotten me.

146
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:44,329
You want to know why?

147
00:07:44,364 --> 00:07:45,922
Because l'm too generous.

148
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:46,932
lt's my nature.

149
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:49,594
l make life too easy
for them.

150
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,501
You know what l am?

151
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:56,976
l am the strong base upon which
Monroe Stahr rests.

152
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:58,374
l'm loyal to him,

153
00:07:58,411 --> 00:07:59,537
and l'm loyal to New York.

154
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:01,513
New York knows you're loyal...

155
00:08:01,548 --> 00:08:03,038
and New York respects you
for it.

156
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:04,674
Well, New York
should be loyal, too.

157
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:06,082
New York is loyal.

158
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:07,086
To who?

159
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,178
To you.

160
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:10,121
All l want is recognition.

161
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,748
You've got it.

162
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,088
l want to see it.

163
00:08:13,126 --> 00:08:14,718
l want to see it right here
on this desk.

164
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:16,319
l want to feel it.

165
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:23,602
Just cut it out, would you?

166
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:25,935
You see that bastard
touch my daughter?

167
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:26,937
Who is he?

168
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,634
Some goddamn writer.

169
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:32,372
You know, l went down to the
writers' building this morning.

170
00:08:32,412 --> 00:08:35,779
l stood there and watched them
for 15 minutes.

171
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:38,943
There were two of them there
didn't write a line.

172
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:39,952
You can go right in.

173
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:41,077
Thanks.

174
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,325
Hi.

175
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:55,760
Are you an actress?

176
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:57,793
No, l'm just
Daddy's little daughter.

177
00:08:57,837 --> 00:08:58,895
Uh-huh.

178
00:08:58,938 --> 00:08:59,905
What are you?

179
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:01,839
Oh, l'm just a lawyer

180
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,239
from New York.

181
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:05,176
She's too intelligent
to be an actress.

182
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,906
She's graduating
from Bennington next June,

183
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:07,913
with honors.

184
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:09,778
l love actors, though.

185
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,010
l don't need all this.

186
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,211
Oh, sure you do.

187
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,858
What's the matter,
don't you feel well?

188
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:20,859
l don't feel so good.

189
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:21,882
You want some bicarbonate?

190
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:24,020
l feel so shaky.

191
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,325
Here.

192
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:27,390
What were you doing
with that writer?

193
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:28,593
He's all right.

194
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:31,069
Don't get too close
to writers.

195
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:54,185
Jesus Christ!

196
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:01,791
Cecilia, are you all right?

197
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:06,699
Stahr!

198
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:16,943
Brady!

199
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:18,041
Brady!

200
00:10:25,058 --> 00:10:25,990
Hello?

201
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:26,991
Yeah?

202
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:27,992
Are you all right?

203
00:10:28,061 --> 00:10:28,993
What happened?

204
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:30,154
Geez, yeah.

205
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:32,391
We had an earthquake.

206
00:10:32,432 --> 00:10:34,195
Monroe, pick up the phone,
will you?

207
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:39,296
Yeah.

208
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:40,704
Yeah, l'll be right down.

209
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,867
Robbie!

210
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:04,330
Yeah!

211
00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:05,331
lt's split!

212
00:11:05,365 --> 00:11:06,354
lt's split all the way down...

213
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,366
Help with that spot!

214
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,958
Go on!

215
00:11:09,936 --> 00:11:11,096
ls that where
it's coming from?

216
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:12,126
Yeah, that's it.

217
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,365
Look at the water tower.

218
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:14,634
Get a light on it.

219
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,232
Get a light on
that pipe break!

220
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:18,835
Where's the valve, Robbie?

221
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:20,311
You know where the valve is?

222
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:25,306
Robbie, they're shooting
on 17 and 24.

223
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,784
See the gates are shut tight.

224
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,282
French village is flooded, too.

225
00:11:32,325 --> 00:11:34,589
We'll get the pumps from
the tanks on stage nine.

226
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:35,616
Okay.

227
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:36,889
Robbie, we need more men.

228
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:37,896
Oh, Christ,

229
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:38,954
we need that head next week.

230
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:45,665
Bring in the pumps
from stage nine!

231
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:46,899
Stage nine.

232
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:53,407
Watch those cables!

233
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:55,038
Get the cables
out of the water!

234
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:21,970
Whoa...

235
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:23,268
All right, hold it, right...

236
00:12:24,377 --> 00:12:26,436
Whoa.

237
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:28,447
l'm sorry.

238
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:32,110
We just followed the trucks in.

239
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:07,411
Good evening, sir.

240
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,045
Good evening, Kino.

241
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:17,326
ls everything all right
at the studio, sir?

242
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:18,990
Yes.

243
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:44,089
Would you like some tea?

244
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:45,351
No, thank you.

245
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:47,256
Shall l turn off the lights?

246
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:49,158
Yes.

247
00:13:58,704 --> 00:14:01,696
Darling, l've come home.

248
00:14:01,741 --> 00:14:04,073
Yes.

249
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,202
Yes.

250
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:08,270
l told you, one of them
wore a silver belt.

251
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:11,613
How dare you ask me
that question?

252
00:14:13,486 --> 00:14:16,046
No, l don't know which one
wore it.

253
00:14:16,088 --> 00:14:17,112
Right.

254
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:18,555
Cut!

255
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:20,081
Well, find a cop on duty.

256
00:14:20,126 --> 00:14:21,184
Mm-hmm.

257
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:23,593
And tell Robinson to call me
as soon as he wakes up.

258
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:26,823
Which one, Monroe?

259
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,561
Take six.

260
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:30,364
No, wait, let's see it again.

261
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:32,098
Roll it again, Jack.

262
00:14:32,138 --> 00:14:33,105
Stage 24,

263
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:34,197
take five.

264
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,605
Action!

265
00:14:37,777 --> 00:14:41,144
Yeah?

266
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,670
You found the name?

267
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:45,275
Oh, good work, good work.

268
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:48,915
Uh-huh.

269
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:51,583
Well, no, divide the name
between yourselves

270
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:52,750
and try every one in the book.

271
00:14:52,792 --> 00:14:53,759
Okay?

272
00:14:53,793 --> 00:14:54,782
Good work.

273
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:56,817
Hi.

274
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,390
Will you go to the ball
with me tomorrow night?

275
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:03,402
What ball?

276
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:05,404
Screenwriters' Ball...

277
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:07,497
down at the Ambassador.

278
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,529
Oh, yeah.

279
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:09,563
No, l don't think so.

280
00:15:09,609 --> 00:15:10,906
l might just come in late.

281
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:11,967
Oh?

282
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,422
So...

283
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,648
Uh...

284
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:27,886
So, when do you go
back to college?

285
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,485
l've just got home.

286
00:15:30,997 --> 00:15:32,191
You get the whole summer off.

287
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:34,666
l'm sorry.

288
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,827
l'll go back as soon as l can.

289
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:38,734
Well, don't you want to?

290
00:15:40,206 --> 00:15:43,733
Well, l don't know.

291
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,939
l'm pretty well educated.

292
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:48,412
Maybe l should get married.

293
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:49,745
Well, l'd marry you.

294
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,409
l'm lonely, but...

295
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:53,282
l'm too old and tired
to undertake anything.

296
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:54,843
Undertake me.

297
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:56,252
What?

298
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:05,763
Undertake me.

299
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,062
Oh, no, Cecilia.

300
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,596
l've known you so long.

301
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,366
l've never thought of you
that way.

302
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:17,540
You don't use that line
this year.

303
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:19,545
What?

304
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:20,568
Nothing.

305
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:24,438
Yeah?

306
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,543
Mr. Stahr, Mr. Rodriguez

307
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:27,780
is still waiting to see you.

308
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,787
Oh, yeah. Send him in.

309
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:29,788
l'm sorry.

310
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:30,789
These actors...

311
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,450
Did you press that buzzer
with your foot?

312
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:35,086
Yes.

313
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:37,118
Of course not.

314
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:38,687
But you will dance with me
at the ball.

315
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:40,925
Sure l will.

316
00:16:42,802 --> 00:16:43,791
Hello, Monroe.

317
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:45,838
Hello!

318
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:46,839
How are you?

319
00:16:46,873 --> 00:16:48,363
Wonderful, really great.

320
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:49,431
You look just wonderful.

321
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:50,464
Thank you.

322
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:55,444
l had to see you
in your office.

323
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:57,506
Sit down.

324
00:17:03,923 --> 00:17:07,586
So... what's the trouble?

325
00:17:07,627 --> 00:17:08,651

326
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,423
You're through?

327
00:17:10,463 --> 00:17:11,794
What do you mean,
you're through?

328
00:17:11,831 --> 00:17:12,798
Have you seen Variety?

329
00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:14,891
Your picture's held over
at the Roxy.

330
00:17:14,934 --> 00:17:16,925
lt did 37,000 in Chicago
last week.

331
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:18,959
l know.

332
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:23,407
That's a tragedy.

333
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:25,410
l'm in a tragic mess.

334
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:26,433
lt's...

335
00:17:31,017 --> 00:17:32,814
Well, what are you

336
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:36,181
lt's Esther and me.

337
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:37,348
Mm-hmm?

338
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,379
l love her.

339
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:39,391
She's my wife.

340
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:40,392
Yeah?

341
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:41,950
But l'm through.

342
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,528
l'm washed up.

343
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:46,691
lt's gone.

344
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,826
What's gone?

345
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:51,029
l've gone.

346
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:56,065
l'm ashamed to go to bed
with my wife.

347
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,913
l know Rainy Day grossed
25,000 in Des Moines

348
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:06,177
and broke all records
in St. Louis

349
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:08,482
and did 27,000 in Kansas City?

350
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:09,579
Kansas City.

351
00:18:09,622 --> 00:18:10,748
But here l am,

352
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,917
afraid to go to bed
with my own wife,

353
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:15,789
the woman l love.

354
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:18,058
So l came to you, Monroe.

355
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:21,059
l've been to a doctor.

356
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,426
l've been to a cathouse.

357
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:25,937
Ah.

358
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:27,767
Yeah... nothing.

359
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:29,331
Nothing.

360
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:31,343
So, l... so l came to you.

361
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,946
Yes, you did, l see.

362
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:55,689
Ah...

363
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:04,407
l mean, we both came from
nowhere, from nothing, right?

364
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:05,410
Right.

365
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:07,105
What were you,
a messenger boy?

366
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,113
That's right.

367
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,580
l delivered groceries.

368
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:10,582
Yeah.

369
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:12,049
This is America.

370
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:14,075
Look where we are now.

371
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:17,419
l mean, look at this
office, look at you.

372
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:18,445
Yeah.

373
00:19:20,126 --> 00:19:21,855
We both came from nothing.

374
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:23,885
That's why l can talk to you.

375
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:24,987
l understand.

376
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:28,233
So, how is Esther?

377
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:29,791
She's the greatest girl
in the world.

378
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:30,802
She's my wife.

379
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:31,860
Well, l know that.

380
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:33,098
l mean, she loves me.

381
00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:34,265
Oh, l know, l know.

382
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:35,933
500 girls marched
up to my house

383
00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:37,067
from the high school.

384
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:39,577
l stood behind the curtains
and l watched them.

385
00:19:39,612 --> 00:19:40,579
l couldn't go out.

386
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:42,911
l mean, if they knew...

387
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:44,939
lf my family knew...

388
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,314
l watch myself on the screen

389
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:47,944
and l want to puke!

390
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,510
Mm.

391
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:53,847
Look at me.

392
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:55,224
All right, l'm a big star,

393
00:19:55,261 --> 00:19:57,126
but what's really
profound about me

394
00:19:57,163 --> 00:19:59,427
is that l'm a big star
with a big fan club

395
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:01,228
- Yeah, l-l know.
- who actually loves his wife,

396
00:20:01,267 --> 00:20:03,428
so why would anyone want to play
these lousy tricks on me?

397
00:20:03,469 --> 00:20:04,436
You see what l mean?

398
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,563
Sure, sure.

399
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:10,237
So l came to you.

400
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,705
Yeah.

401
00:20:27,827 --> 00:20:29,454
Oh, yes,
l see.

402
00:20:29,495 --> 00:20:30,894
Just play the part
the way l said.

403
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:31,897
All right then

404
00:20:31,931 --> 00:20:32,898
Thanks, Monroe.

405
00:20:32,932 --> 00:20:33,921
Thanks.

406
00:20:35,034 --> 00:20:36,331
The doctor's here.

407
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:37,630
Ah.

408
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:41,628
Hi, Doc.

409
00:20:41,674 --> 00:20:43,369
Come on in.

410
00:20:59,158 --> 00:21:01,820
When are you going
to take that vacation?

411
00:21:01,861 --> 00:21:03,556
Soon.

412
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:04,790
When?

413
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,798
Oh, sometime
in five or six weeks.

414
00:21:10,169 --> 00:21:11,830
Getting any sleep?

415
00:21:11,871 --> 00:21:13,532
About five hours.

416
00:21:14,874 --> 00:21:16,205
Do you need any more pills?

417
00:21:16,242 --> 00:21:17,641
No, l'm fine.

418
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:22,609
Any... pain?

419
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:25,405
Some.

420
00:21:26,986 --> 00:21:28,886
They'll never get
writers unionized.

421
00:21:28,921 --> 00:21:29,910
You know why?

422
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,090
Hello, Monroe.

423
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,091
Gentlemen.

424
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,092
Monroe.

425
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,115
Gentlemen.

426
00:21:38,898 --> 00:21:39,990
Everything all right?

427
00:21:40,099 --> 00:21:41,088
Fine.

428
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:43,729
l was just saying

429
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:45,737
they'll never get
the writers unionized.

430
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:46,738
You know why?

431
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:48,899
Because they hate
each other's guts.

432
00:21:48,941 --> 00:21:50,499
They'd sell each other out
for a nickel.

433
00:21:50,543 --> 00:21:52,670
This man from New York
seems pretty set on doing it...

434
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:54,144
the one who's coming out
to see me.

435
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,147
What's his name?

436
00:21:55,181 --> 00:21:56,409
Brimmer.

437
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:00,579
Brimmer.

438
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:02,484
Communist, yeah.

439
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:03,818
You mean a real Communist?

440
00:22:03,856 --> 00:22:05,687
Yeah, sure, a real one.

441
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:06,884
l mean,

442
00:22:06,926 --> 00:22:08,416
some of these guys
are just jokers

443
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,950
that call themselves Communists.

444
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,895
And mostly they are fairies,
too.

445
00:22:11,931 --> 00:22:13,922
There are other aspects,
of course.

446
00:22:13,966 --> 00:22:15,263
Well...

447
00:22:15,301 --> 00:22:17,064
l'll find out next week.

448
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:19,070
Better find out.

449
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:21,971
The last thing we need
is a writers' strike.

450
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:25,237
We got 16 pictures
going into production.

451
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:26,437
l'll handle him.

452
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:28,681
Monroe can handle him.

453
00:22:28,814 --> 00:22:30,145
Monroe can handle anybody.

454
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:32,377
Anyway, mostly they are fairies.

455
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:35,313
There are other aspects,
of course.

456
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:39,988
Monroe, tell me, what do
you think of the idea

457
00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:41,754
to make Manon with
a happy ending, huh?

458
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:45,087
lt's been making money
without a happy ending

459
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,324
for a century and a half.

460
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,127
What about
the South American picture?

461
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,564
We're going ahead with that.

462
00:22:52,604 --> 00:22:53,730
With the same budget?

463
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,268
lt's out of proportion.

464
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:00,778
With that budget,
we have no chance.

465
00:23:01,814 --> 00:23:03,611
What do you think, Mr. Marcus?

466
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:11,251
Monroe is our
production genius.

467
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:13,349
l count upon him

468
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,326
and lean heavily
upon him.

469
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:20,889
The balance sheet last year
showed a $27 million profit.

470
00:23:20,933 --> 00:23:22,924
lt's all due to him.

471
00:23:27,473 --> 00:23:29,407
You know who first told him
you were a genius?

472
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:31,932
Guess.

473
00:23:31,977 --> 00:23:32,944
You.

474
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:34,912
Right.

475
00:23:34,947 --> 00:23:35,971
Damn good of you, Pat.

476
00:23:36,014 --> 00:23:36,981
No, no.

477
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:38,641
l admire a man, l say so.

478
00:23:38,684 --> 00:23:40,618
l want the whole world to know.

479
00:23:40,652 --> 00:23:42,677
Perhaps that's
because l'm lrish.

480
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:44,621
The lrish are a very
warm-hearted people.

481
00:23:44,656 --> 00:23:46,248
The Greeks are warm, too.

482
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:47,883
l mean, try to find me
a Greek Communist.

483
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,086
You couldn't find one.

484
00:23:49,128 --> 00:23:51,494
But there's not a $2 million
gross in the country right now.

485
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:53,521
Don't forget, we're in
the middle of a depression.

486
00:23:53,565 --> 00:23:54,532
l know that.

487
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:57,262
l think we can count
on a million and a quarter

488
00:23:57,302 --> 00:23:58,394
from the road show,

489
00:23:58,437 --> 00:23:59,995
perhaps a million and a half,

490
00:24:00,072 --> 00:24:01,903
and a quarter of a million
abroad.

491
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:05,535
But you have a budget
of a million, seven-five-o,

492
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:08,171
and you say you expect
less than that in grosses?

493
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:10,044
What about prints
and advertising?

494
00:24:10,082 --> 00:24:12,050
Distribution costs.

495
00:24:12,084 --> 00:24:14,245
lnterest on the money...
and some profits.

496
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:15,310
Yes, he's here.

497
00:24:15,354 --> 00:24:17,049
l'm not even sure
we'll gross a million.

498
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:19,721
lt's for you, Mr. Stahr.

499
00:24:19,758 --> 00:24:21,191
Thank you.

500
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:22,193
Yes.

501
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:23,216
Hello, Robin.

502
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:27,163
Uh-huh.

503
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:28,826
Good.

504
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:30,562
Yes, leave the number
with Miss Doolin.

505
00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:31,591
l'll call later.

506
00:24:32,671 --> 00:24:34,605
You know, l'm fairly new
out here.

507
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,734
Do l understand you to say that
you expect to gross

508
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:40,506
a half a million short
of your budget?

509
00:24:40,546 --> 00:24:42,241
lt's a quality picture.

510
00:24:42,281 --> 00:24:43,475
"Quality picture."

511
00:24:43,515 --> 00:24:45,244
What the hell are we...?

512
00:24:45,284 --> 00:24:48,310
We've played safe
for two years now.

513
00:24:48,353 --> 00:24:50,753
lt's time we made a picture
that isn't meant to make money.

514
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:52,916
Pat Brady is always saying
at Academy dinners

515
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:54,949
that we have a certain duty
to the public.

516
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:56,085
Okay.

517
00:24:56,128 --> 00:24:57,925
lt's a good thing
for the company

518
00:24:57,963 --> 00:25:00,261
to slip in a picture
that'll lose money...

519
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:01,891
write it off as good will.

520
00:25:03,302 --> 00:25:04,291
Gentlemen.

521
00:25:10,475 --> 00:25:12,170
Thank you.

522
00:25:18,217 --> 00:25:19,206
Boy.

523
00:25:20,385 --> 00:25:21,409
Mr. Stahr!

524
00:25:22,588 --> 00:25:24,522
Hey, that's a good spiral
you got there.

525
00:25:24,556 --> 00:25:25,523
- Hello, Monroe.
- Hi, Dan.

526
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:26,524
- Sir.
- Yes, Wylie.

527
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:27,525
Hello, Mr. Stahr.

528
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:28,526
You going somewhere?

529
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,527
Stage four.

530
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:31,756
Listen, have you read my script?

531
00:25:31,797 --> 00:25:32,957
Uh, yes, l have.

532
00:25:32,998 --> 00:25:35,330
Well, what do you think of it?

533
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,062
l think it's
an interesting script.

534
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:38,364
Uh-huh.

535
00:25:38,403 --> 00:25:40,371
How come you have
two other writers on it?

536
00:25:40,405 --> 00:25:41,372
- Take it away!
- Who told you that?

537
00:25:41,406 --> 00:25:42,532
They're friends of mine.

538
00:25:42,574 --> 00:25:44,064
They didn't know l was doing it.

539
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:45,667
l didn't know
they were doing it.

540
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:46,939
We all found out this morning.

541
00:25:46,979 --> 00:25:48,708
l'm sorry.
What can you do?

542
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:49,714
That's the system.

543
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:50,715
We're back!

544
00:25:50,749 --> 00:25:51,841
You invented that system.

545
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:52,976
You've distorted the girl.

546
00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:55,282
By distorting the girl,
you've distorted the story.

547
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,515
We're back.

548
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:58,682
How?

549
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:00,692
How have l distorted
the damn girl?

550
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:02,626
l'm not interested
in your fantasies.

551
00:26:02,661 --> 00:26:04,219
Eddie.

552
00:26:04,263 --> 00:26:05,230
Eddie!

553
00:26:05,264 --> 00:26:06,231
Hello, Monroe.

554
00:26:06,265 --> 00:26:07,232
Hi.

555
00:26:07,266 --> 00:26:08,790
Listen, two people
at the sneak preview

556
00:26:08,834 --> 00:26:11,029
complained that Morgan's fly
was open for half the picture.

557
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:12,195
What?

558
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,102
Oh, it's probably just a couple
of seconds, but l want you

559
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:15,606
to run the picture
until you find the footage.

560
00:26:15,641 --> 00:26:17,165
Have some people with you.
Someone will spot it.

561
00:26:17,209 --> 00:26:18,176
Sure, l'll take care of it.

562
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:19,177
Okay.

563
00:26:19,211 --> 00:26:20,439
Hi, Cooke.

564
00:26:20,479 --> 00:26:21,741
You've given her a secret life.

565
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,077
She doesn't have a secret life.

566
00:26:23,115 --> 00:26:24,343
You've made her a melancholic.

567
00:26:24,383 --> 00:26:25,407
She's not a melancholic.

568
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:26,417
Mr. Stahr.

569
00:26:26,451 --> 00:26:27,418
How do you know?

570
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:28,544
Because l paid 50,000 bucks
for that book,

571
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:29,713
and because that's
the way l see it.

572
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:31,586
- Mr. Stahr.
- Thank you.

573
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:33,955
lf l want to do a Eugene O'Neill
play, l'll buy one.

574
00:26:34,026 --> 00:26:37,985
The girl stands for health,
vitality, love.

575
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,161
You've made her a whore.

576
00:26:42,401 --> 00:26:44,494
Now, you can work
with Beth and Charlie on this,

577
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:45,969
or l'll take you off
the subject.

578
00:26:46,038 --> 00:26:47,096
lt's up to you.

579
00:26:49,207 --> 00:26:50,731
So how do you want the girl?

580
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:52,801
Perfect.

581
00:26:52,844 --> 00:26:54,106
Mm-hmm.

582
00:26:57,049 --> 00:26:58,448
Gee.

583
00:27:07,225 --> 00:27:09,523
And l always have admired you.

584
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:12,394
Were you wearing a silver belt
last night?

585
00:27:12,431 --> 00:27:14,524
Yes, l was.

586
00:27:16,168 --> 00:27:19,934
l'm glad we got you.

587
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:21,938
We didn't have much to go on.

588
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:25,102
Oh, really?

589
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:27,407
Who are you?

590
00:27:27,446 --> 00:27:29,937
My name is Monroe Stahr.

591
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:31,381
l'd like to see you.

592
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:33,077
There's a reason.

593
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:34,949
What reason?

594
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:39,487
Well, l'd like to talk
to you for a few minutes.

595
00:27:39,524 --> 00:27:40,684
To put me in the movies?

596
00:27:40,726 --> 00:27:43,422
No, that wasn't my idea.

597
00:27:43,462 --> 00:27:44,429
When?

598
00:27:44,463 --> 00:27:45,623
Tonight.

599
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:46,824
Where?

600
00:27:46,865 --> 00:27:48,355
At your house?

601
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,731
No.

602
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:52,100
Somewhere outside.

603
00:27:52,137 --> 00:27:54,605
l'll meet you
somewhere at 9:00.

604
00:27:54,639 --> 00:27:56,971
l'm afraid that's impossible.

605
00:27:57,075 --> 00:27:59,305
Oh.

606
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:00,675
Uh...

607
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:02,373
What about tomorrow?

608
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:03,438
No, no, no.

609
00:28:03,482 --> 00:28:05,416
Okay, tonight, 9:00.

610
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:08,783
On the corner
of Webster and Park?

611
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,481
Okay.

612
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,854
Should l wear
the silver belt?

613
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:14,017
Yes.

614
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:20,498
Hello, Monroe.

615
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:21,590
How's it going?

616
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:23,601
Geez, l'm glad you came down.

617
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:25,996
She's too old for me.

618
00:28:30,742 --> 00:28:33,404
See who it is.

619
00:28:37,115 --> 00:28:38,377
Hello.

620
00:28:38,417 --> 00:28:43,047
Oh, get these photographers
away from me!

621
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:44,612
May l?

622
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:45,782
No, let's go.

623
00:28:47,592 --> 00:28:49,958
These publicity men.

624
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:50,960
How are you?

625
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:52,655
l've got the damn curse,

626
00:28:52,697 --> 00:28:54,824
and l'm having
all these troubles

627
00:28:54,866 --> 00:28:56,356
with my frigging hair.

628
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:57,891
Well, don't worry about it.

629
00:28:57,936 --> 00:28:58,925
lt's like seaweed.

630
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:00,733
They're using
the wrong shampoo.

631
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:02,797
They're trying to screw me,
these bitches.

632
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:03,808
On my word of...

633
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:07,642
We're using
her favorite shampoo!

634
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:10,341
Oh, darling, forgive me.

635
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:17,180
Nobody likes me, or something.

636
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:18,689
l love you, Didi.

637
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:24,418
How do you think l look?

638
00:29:24,463 --> 00:29:27,762
How do you think l look
on the screen?

639
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:29,699
You're going to be beautiful.

640
00:29:29,734 --> 00:29:31,725
You're a great actress.

641
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:37,769
lsn't she a terrible bitch?

642
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:39,470
You can't handle her.

643
00:29:40,912 --> 00:29:43,472
We'll have to call it off, Red.

644
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:44,743
The picture?

645
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:45,875
No.

646
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:48,545
l'm putting Daditch on it.

647
00:29:48,587 --> 00:29:50,111
Oh.

648
00:29:50,155 --> 00:29:52,146
We'll try some other time.

649
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:54,715
Shall l finish this scene?

650
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:57,489
lt's being done now.
Daditch is in there.

651
00:29:57,529 --> 00:29:58,962
Well, what the hell
is he...?

652
00:29:58,997 --> 00:30:00,521
He went in when we came out.

653
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:02,226
He read the script last night.

654
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:03,502
You bastard.

655
00:30:03,502 --> 00:30:05,527
You bastard.

656
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:08,368
Listen, you haven't touched

657
00:30:08,406 --> 00:30:10,397
what she's able to do.

658
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:15,108
How about my coat?

659
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:16,841
l left it on the set.

660
00:30:26,691 --> 00:30:27,919
Here it is.

661
00:30:30,529 --> 00:30:32,190
Okay, that's it.

662
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:37,128
Yes?

663
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:39,102
lt's Mr. Brady.

664
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,407
Yeah.

665
00:30:43,441 --> 00:30:44,408
Monroe,

666
00:30:44,442 --> 00:30:46,672
we've just had a call
from New York... urgent.

667
00:30:46,711 --> 00:30:47,871
Do you have a minute?

668
00:30:47,913 --> 00:30:49,778
No, it'll have to wait
till morning.

669
00:30:49,814 --> 00:30:51,008
We can come in to you.

670
00:30:51,082 --> 00:30:53,073
- All l need is...
- Not now.

671
00:31:25,317 --> 00:31:26,682
Hi.

672
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:31,114
Where are we going?

673
00:31:31,156 --> 00:31:32,316
l don't know.

674
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:36,856
What about a hotel?

675
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,829
No, l'll run you home.
Where do you live?

676
00:31:38,863 --> 00:31:40,831
Run me home?

677
00:31:40,865 --> 00:31:41,991
Mm-hmm.

678
00:31:42,033 --> 00:31:43,398
lt's no hurry.

679
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,601
What's the matter?

680
00:31:47,872 --> 00:31:50,739
Don't you like me?

681
00:31:50,775 --> 00:31:53,972
l thought you liked me.

682
00:31:54,012 --> 00:31:55,707
l've been stupid.

683
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,112
Last night l had an idea

684
00:31:57,148 --> 00:31:59,139
you were the exact double
of someone l knew.

685
00:31:59,184 --> 00:32:01,414
lt was dark, and the light
was in my eyes.

686
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:05,345
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

687
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:08,389
That's funny.

688
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:10,690
Which way?

689
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:12,923
Westwood.

690
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:18,135
l'm an actress.

691
00:32:18,169 --> 00:32:19,830
Hmm.

692
00:32:20,639 --> 00:32:22,766
l'm going to be an actress.

693
00:32:22,807 --> 00:32:24,968
Mm-hmm.

694
00:32:30,582 --> 00:32:33,278
Listen, could you stop here
a minute, please?

695
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:34,683
You said the end of the street.

696
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:37,347
Yes, but l'd like to stop here
a minute, please.

697
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:42,215
Could you wait a second?

698
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:53,099
Kathleen?

699
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:54,662
Edna?

700
00:33:04,382 --> 00:33:06,111
See him? There he is.

701
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:22,561
Who is he?

702
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,760
l think it was you

703
00:33:23,802 --> 00:33:24,769
he wanted to see.

704
00:33:24,803 --> 00:33:26,634
He telephoned me.

705
00:33:37,382 --> 00:33:39,646
l'm afraid we were rude
at the studio.

706
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:41,948
Oh...

707
00:33:41,986 --> 00:33:43,453
We had no business there.

708
00:33:43,488 --> 00:33:47,219
Well, l hope you'll both come
and make a real tour...

709
00:33:47,258 --> 00:33:48,418
of the studio.

710
00:33:49,461 --> 00:33:50,655
Who are you?

711
00:33:53,498 --> 00:33:54,556
He's a producer.

712
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:57,329
He got us mixed up.

713
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:59,165
Phone me, will you?

714
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:03,372
Good night, Mr. Stahr.

715
00:34:04,175 --> 00:34:06,040
Oh, good night.

716
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:13,508
You're lrish.

717
00:34:15,086 --> 00:34:16,747
l've lived in London
a long time.

718
00:34:16,788 --> 00:34:19,279
l didn't think you could tell.

719
00:34:19,324 --> 00:34:20,313
Oh, yes.

720
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,205
You've lived in London?

721
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,071
Yes.

722
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:44,173
l came out here
a few months ago.

723
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:51,985
Was it me you wanted to see,
or Edna?

724
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:52,988
Uh...

725
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,615
l made a silly mistake.

726
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:56,354
l thought you were wearing
the silver belt.

727
00:34:56,394 --> 00:34:58,988
Oh.

728
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,155
But l wasn't.

729
00:35:00,198 --> 00:35:02,632
No, but it was you
who l wanted to see.

730
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:04,396
Yes?

731
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:06,369
Why?

732
00:35:06,404 --> 00:35:07,871
You reminded me of someone.

733
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:13,133
So you're Mr. Stahr,
the producer?

734
00:35:13,178 --> 00:35:14,440
Mm-hmm.

735
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:16,470
l suppose the girls are
all after you

736
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:18,914
to put them on the screen.

737
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,475
They've given up.

738
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:23,453
You didn't want to put me
in the pictures?

739
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:24,512
No.

740
00:35:24,556 --> 00:35:26,421
Good.

741
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:30,892
l feel as if
l had my foot in the door.

742
00:35:30,929 --> 00:35:32,954
Like a collector.

743
00:35:32,997 --> 00:35:35,864
l'm sorry,
l can't ask you in.

744
00:35:43,942 --> 00:35:46,433
Well...

745
00:35:50,682 --> 00:35:51,808
ls this all?

746
00:35:53,852 --> 00:35:56,412
Well, l do hope
we'll meet again.

747
00:35:58,756 --> 00:36:01,156
l'd be sorry if we didn't.

748
00:36:30,955 --> 00:36:32,547
Good evening, sir.

749
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:34,615
Good evening.

750
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:37,150
Will you be running
a movie tonight?

751
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:42,493
No.

752
00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:49,330
Shall l turn off the lights?

753
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:50,636
Yes.

754
00:37:06,591 --> 00:37:08,081
Sit down, Mr. Boxley.

755
00:37:11,029 --> 00:37:12,263
l can't go on.
lt's a waste of time.

756
00:37:12,263 --> 00:37:14,163
l can't go on.
lt's a waste of time.

757
00:37:14,198 --> 00:37:15,756
Why?

758
00:37:15,799 --> 00:37:17,790
You've stuck me with two hacks.

759
00:37:20,004 --> 00:37:21,096
They can't write.

760
00:37:21,138 --> 00:37:22,833
And they... bugger up

761
00:37:22,873 --> 00:37:24,500
everything l write.

762
00:37:24,541 --> 00:37:26,270
Well, why don't you just
write it yourself?

763
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:27,800
l have.
l sent you some.

764
00:37:27,845 --> 00:37:29,472
That was just talk.
We'd lose the audience.

765
00:37:29,513 --> 00:37:31,640
Talk?

766
00:37:31,682 --> 00:37:32,671
Mm-hmm.

767
00:37:32,716 --> 00:37:35,651
l don't think you people
read things.

768
00:37:35,686 --> 00:37:36,653
The men...

769
00:37:36,687 --> 00:37:39,121
The men are dueling...

770
00:37:39,156 --> 00:37:40,953
when this conversation
takes place.

771
00:37:41,058 --> 00:37:43,117
At the end,
one of them falls into a well

772
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,754
and has to be hauled up...

773
00:37:45,796 --> 00:37:47,525
in a bucket.

774
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,891
Would you write that
in a book of your own?

775
00:37:51,935 --> 00:37:54,495
Of course l wouldn't.

776
00:37:54,538 --> 00:37:58,338
l inherited
this absurd situation.

777
00:37:58,375 --> 00:37:59,967
Let me ask you,

778
00:38:00,077 --> 00:38:02,910
do you ever go to the movies?

779
00:38:02,946 --> 00:38:04,208
Rarely.

780
00:38:04,248 --> 00:38:05,840
Because people are always
dueling

781
00:38:05,883 --> 00:38:06,907
and falling down wells?

782
00:38:07,017 --> 00:38:08,075
And talking a load of rubbish!

783
00:38:08,118 --> 00:38:10,086
Listen...

784
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,451
has your office got
a stove in it

785
00:38:11,488 --> 00:38:12,477
that lights with a match?

786
00:38:12,523 --> 00:38:14,650
l think so.

787
00:38:14,692 --> 00:38:16,626
Suppose you're in your office.

788
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:18,423
You've been fighting duels
all day.

789
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:19,486
You're exhausted.

790
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:23,729
This is you.

791
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:28,397
A girl comes in.

792
00:38:45,589 --> 00:38:47,181
She doesn't see you.

793
00:38:49,993 --> 00:38:51,517
She takes off her gloves.

794
00:38:54,198 --> 00:38:55,358
She opens her purse.

795
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:57,594
She dumps it out on the table.

796
00:38:57,634 --> 00:38:59,898
You watch her.

797
00:39:02,172 --> 00:39:03,696
This is you.

798
00:39:06,477 --> 00:39:07,466
Now...

799
00:39:09,279 --> 00:39:13,716
She has two dimes, a matchbox
and a nickel.

800
00:39:15,652 --> 00:39:18,450
She leaves the nickel
on the table.

801
00:39:18,489 --> 00:39:21,549
She puts the two dimes
back into her purse.

802
00:39:21,592 --> 00:39:24,857
She takes the gloves...
they're black.

803
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:28,621
Puts them into the stove.

804
00:39:28,665 --> 00:39:30,929
Lights a match.

805
00:39:30,968 --> 00:39:34,404
Suddenly, the telephone rings.

806
00:39:40,411 --> 00:39:42,242
She picks it up.

807
00:39:42,279 --> 00:39:44,372
She listens.

808
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:48,408
She says, "l've never owned
a pair of black gloves

809
00:39:48,452 --> 00:39:49,612
in my life."

810
00:39:49,653 --> 00:39:51,143
Hangs up.

811
00:39:51,188 --> 00:39:52,314
Kneels by the stove.

812
00:39:52,356 --> 00:39:53,550
Lights another match.

813
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:55,592
Suddenly,

814
00:39:55,626 --> 00:39:56,854
you notice...

815
00:39:59,062 --> 00:40:01,622
...there's another man
in the room...

816
00:40:06,136 --> 00:40:09,435
watching every move
the girl makes.

817
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:42,837
What happens?

818
00:40:43,974 --> 00:40:44,941
l don't know.

819
00:40:44,975 --> 00:40:46,840
l was just making pictures.

820
00:40:48,312 --> 00:40:49,540
What was the nickel for?

821
00:40:50,714 --> 00:40:52,181
Jane, what was the nickel for?

822
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:54,915
The nickel was for the movies.

823
00:41:02,359 --> 00:41:04,793
What do you pay me for?

824
00:41:04,828 --> 00:41:06,819
l don't understand
the damn stuff.

825
00:41:06,864 --> 00:41:09,856
Yes, you do...

826
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,232
or you wouldn't have asked
about the nickel.

827
00:41:21,778 --> 00:41:24,406
Well, Monroe's right.

828
00:41:24,448 --> 00:41:25,745
Lights.

829
00:41:25,782 --> 00:41:27,773
Needs about 20 minutes
out of it.

830
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:30,981
Twice it just lays there
and goes to sleep.

831
00:41:31,054 --> 00:41:33,215
Well, l've got to go to
that damn writers' ball.

832
00:41:33,257 --> 00:41:35,282
l'll talk to you
tomorrow, Eddie.

833
00:41:36,493 --> 00:41:38,188
What's Eddie, asleep?

834
00:41:38,228 --> 00:41:39,195
Jesus.

835
00:41:39,229 --> 00:41:40,196
Goddamn movie

836
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:41,595
even puts the editor
to sleep.

837
00:41:45,035 --> 00:41:46,002
He's not asleep,

838
00:41:46,069 --> 00:41:47,661
Mr. Brady.

839
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:51,037
What do you mean,
he's not asleep?

840
00:41:52,376 --> 00:41:54,139
He's dead, Mr. Brady.

841
00:41:55,178 --> 00:41:56,145
Dead?!

842
00:41:56,179 --> 00:41:58,147
What do you mean,
he's dead?

843
00:41:58,181 --> 00:41:59,148
He-he must have died
during the...

844
00:41:59,182 --> 00:42:00,149
How can he be dead?

845
00:42:00,183 --> 00:42:02,174
We were just watching
the rough cut!

846
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:05,287
Jesus, l didn't...
l didn't hear anything.

847
00:42:05,322 --> 00:42:06,584
Did you hear anything?

848
00:42:06,623 --> 00:42:07,715
Not a thing.

849
00:42:08,926 --> 00:42:09,915
Eddie...

850
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:13,191
he probably didn't want
to disturb the screening,

851
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:14,697
Mr. Brady.

852
00:42:23,006 --> 00:42:25,406
Good evening, Mr. Stahr.

853
00:44:08,779 --> 00:44:11,771
What are you doing here?

854
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:15,080
l'm with Martha Dodd's party.

855
00:44:16,353 --> 00:44:18,378
What's your name?

856
00:44:18,422 --> 00:44:20,014
Kathleen Moore.

857
00:44:22,092 --> 00:44:24,117
Kathleen Moore.

858
00:44:24,394 --> 00:44:25,383
Hmm.

859
00:44:25,896 --> 00:44:27,955
How do you know her?

860
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:29,431
Oh.

861
00:44:31,568 --> 00:44:34,935
l met her...

862
00:44:34,971 --> 00:44:36,905
recently.

863
00:44:38,608 --> 00:44:40,576
Are you married?

864
00:44:40,610 --> 00:44:42,305
No.

865
00:44:44,481 --> 00:44:45,971
l must go back now.

866
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:47,847
l promised this dance.

867
00:44:51,254 --> 00:44:54,849
Can we have lunch
or dinner?

868
00:44:54,891 --> 00:44:56,859
No.

869
00:44:59,229 --> 00:45:02,460
lt's impossible.

870
00:45:02,499 --> 00:45:05,491
l must go back.

871
00:45:05,535 --> 00:45:07,662
Thank you for the dance.

872
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:21,647
Monroe?

873
00:45:21,685 --> 00:45:22,652
Monroe?

874
00:45:22,686 --> 00:45:23,653
Hi, Rod.

875
00:45:23,687 --> 00:45:24,779
Hello, Esther.

876
00:45:24,821 --> 00:45:25,845
Hello, Monroe.

877
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:27,584
Monroe, come here.

878
00:45:27,624 --> 00:45:28,591
lsn't she wonderful?

879
00:45:28,625 --> 00:45:29,956
lsn't she beautiful?

880
00:45:29,993 --> 00:45:31,688
Stop.

881
00:45:31,728 --> 00:45:32,717
How are you, Esther?

882
00:45:32,763 --> 00:45:34,128
Great.
Really great.

883
00:45:34,164 --> 00:45:35,756
This is the greatest country
in the world...

884
00:45:35,799 --> 00:45:37,391
everybody stands a chance
in this country.

885
00:45:37,434 --> 00:45:38,867
There's not going to be
no revolution.

886
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:40,961
The only people who want
a revolution are the Communists.

887
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:42,402
And the fairies.

888
00:45:42,439 --> 00:45:43,736
What kind of
a revolution

889
00:45:43,774 --> 00:45:45,071
- do the fairies want?
- A Communist one.

890
00:45:45,108 --> 00:45:47,702
What else?

891
00:45:47,744 --> 00:45:49,371
Do you think Stalin
likes homosexuals?

892
00:45:49,412 --> 00:45:50,379
Homosexuals, eh?

893
00:45:50,413 --> 00:45:51,573
Let me tell you something.

894
00:45:51,615 --> 00:45:53,105
You know, "homo" is
a Greek word.

895
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:54,981
l come from Europe,
l'm Greek.

896
00:45:55,018 --> 00:45:56,986
That's why he knows so much
about Stalin.

897
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:58,487
But Stalin ain't Greek.

898
00:45:58,522 --> 00:46:00,319
You're damn right he ain't.

899
00:46:00,357 --> 00:46:01,324
He's a fairy.

900
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:02,882
He's a bastard, Communist,

901
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:04,518
Russian fairy...
that's what he is!

902
00:46:04,561 --> 00:46:05,550
Calm down.

903
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:07,497
Fleishacker,

904
00:46:07,531 --> 00:46:08,725
let me tell you something.

905
00:46:08,765 --> 00:46:10,733
After the revolution,

906
00:46:10,767 --> 00:46:11,734
you'll be the only safe one.

907
00:46:11,768 --> 00:46:12,792
You know why?

908
00:46:12,836 --> 00:46:14,394
Because they always need lawyers

909
00:46:14,437 --> 00:46:15,404
after a revolution

910
00:46:15,438 --> 00:46:16,769
to straighten out
the legal end.

911
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:21,301
What do you think, Monroe?

912
00:46:21,344 --> 00:46:23,278
l think so, too.

913
00:46:28,151 --> 00:46:30,244
You know, uh...

914
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:32,152
l saw Highway to Tomorrow.

915
00:46:32,189 --> 00:46:35,317
You're right.

916
00:46:35,358 --> 00:46:36,552
You take 20 minutes
out of it,

917
00:46:36,593 --> 00:46:37,821
you got a fine movie.

918
00:46:37,861 --> 00:46:38,850
Possibly.

919
00:46:38,895 --> 00:46:40,328
The shape's not too bad.

920
00:46:40,363 --> 00:46:41,591
The shape is good.

921
00:46:41,631 --> 00:46:42,962
You know why?

922
00:46:43,066 --> 00:46:44,966
Because Eddie is
one of the best cutters

923
00:46:45,001 --> 00:46:46,730
in the business.

924
00:47:09,292 --> 00:47:10,316
Where are you going?

925
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:11,327
lt's early.

926
00:47:11,361 --> 00:47:13,022
lt's late.

927
00:47:13,930 --> 00:47:15,397
They talked as if
l'd been dancing

928
00:47:15,432 --> 00:47:16,592
with the Prince of Wales.

929
00:47:16,633 --> 00:47:17,600
Meet me tomorrow.

930
00:47:17,634 --> 00:47:18,601
Mr. Stahr?

931
00:47:18,635 --> 00:47:19,932
l've said l can't.
lsn't that enough?

932
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:20,937
Not now.

933
00:47:20,971 --> 00:47:22,268
Can l talk to you
for one minute?

934
00:47:22,305 --> 00:47:23,272
Look, tomorrow is Sunday.

935
00:47:23,306 --> 00:47:24,432
Why don't you come
to the studio.

936
00:47:24,474 --> 00:47:25,532
l'll show you
around the studio.

937
00:47:25,575 --> 00:47:26,872
No, l wouldn't like
to see the studio.

938
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:27,877
You wouldn't?

939
00:47:27,911 --> 00:47:28,878
Monroe, we have that...

940
00:47:28,912 --> 00:47:29,879
Excuse me.

941
00:47:29,913 --> 00:47:30,902
l say, Mr. Stahr...

942
00:47:34,885 --> 00:47:35,852
Look.

943
00:47:35,886 --> 00:47:37,148
Look, where would
you like to go?

944
00:47:41,958 --> 00:47:43,619
l'm a weak woman.

945
00:47:51,735 --> 00:47:54,932
lf l meet you tomorrow...

946
00:47:54,971 --> 00:47:56,939
will you leave me in peace?

947
00:48:04,247 --> 00:48:07,808
No, you won't, will you?

948
00:48:07,851 --> 00:48:10,012
So l'll say no...

949
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:11,213
and thank you.

950
00:48:13,023 --> 00:48:14,047
Going down.

951
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:17,019
Oh!

952
00:48:18,361 --> 00:48:20,659
What does it take to get
you to leave a party?

953
00:48:20,697 --> 00:48:22,665
You're the one
who wanted to come.

954
00:48:22,699 --> 00:48:23,927
l only agreed to come

955
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,433
because you said
we wouldn't stay so long.

956
00:48:25,468 --> 00:48:26,730
Not in the elevator.

957
00:48:31,641 --> 00:48:33,199
Main floor.

958
00:48:40,817 --> 00:48:42,307
They looked so strange
when l came in,

959
00:48:42,352 --> 00:48:45,116
as if they were furious at me
for not being somebody famous.

960
00:48:45,155 --> 00:48:46,122
l know another way out.

961
00:48:46,156 --> 00:48:47,783
Back up, back up,
let them through.

962
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:52,785
How old are you?

963
00:48:52,829 --> 00:48:53,887
l've lost track.

964
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:56,091
About 35, l think.

965
00:48:56,132 --> 00:48:57,827
Where are you from?

966
00:48:57,867 --> 00:48:59,459
l was born on the East Side
of New York.

967
00:48:59,502 --> 00:49:01,527
They said at the table
you were the "boy wonder."

968
00:49:01,571 --> 00:49:02,560
Ah...

969
00:49:02,605 --> 00:49:04,698
Where's your car?

970
00:49:09,612 --> 00:49:11,204
Listen, where will we
meet tomorrow?

971
00:49:11,247 --> 00:49:13,545
l'll come by,
and l'll pick you up at 2:00.

972
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:14,572
Hmm?

973
00:49:14,617 --> 00:49:16,608
No...

974
00:49:16,653 --> 00:49:18,086
No.

975
00:49:34,804 --> 00:49:38,399
l'll meet you here,
the same spot.

976
00:49:55,291 --> 00:49:56,622
Have you been here all night?

977
00:49:56,659 --> 00:49:58,627
Yes.

978
00:49:58,661 --> 00:49:59,650
l'd like some tea,

979
00:49:59,696 --> 00:50:02,665
if it's a place
you're not known.

980
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:05,600
There's a place on the coast
where they have a trained seal;

981
00:50:05,635 --> 00:50:07,330
he knows me pretty well.

982
00:50:07,370 --> 00:50:08,769
He bit me once.

983
00:50:08,805 --> 00:50:11,069
But he won't say a word
unless you're rude to him.

984
00:50:12,609 --> 00:50:13,667
What are you hiding?

985
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:17,207
Nothing.

986
00:50:34,230 --> 00:50:35,219
What'll you have?

987
00:50:35,265 --> 00:50:36,232
Two teas.

988
00:50:36,266 --> 00:50:37,255
Right.

989
00:51:02,092 --> 00:51:03,252
Shake?

990
00:51:04,994 --> 00:51:06,256
See?

991
00:51:06,296 --> 00:51:07,285
He remembers you.

992
00:51:08,965 --> 00:51:10,865
This seal has the memory
of an elephant.

993
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:12,128
He likes him...

994
00:51:13,169 --> 00:51:14,604
'cause he's such a charming guy.

995
00:51:14,737 --> 00:51:16,295
Does he respond to affection?

996
00:51:16,339 --> 00:51:18,864
He responds to fish.

997
00:51:18,908 --> 00:51:20,671
This seal's got taste.

998
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:21,677
Come on out.

999
00:51:21,711 --> 00:51:22,678
Seat.

1000
00:51:22,712 --> 00:51:24,373
How long have you known him?

1001
00:51:24,413 --> 00:51:25,380
Oh, l've known him

1002
00:51:25,414 --> 00:51:27,143
for years.

1003
00:51:27,183 --> 00:51:29,242
His father's
an old friend of mine.

1004
00:51:29,285 --> 00:51:31,719
But the family history
ain't too good.

1005
00:51:31,754 --> 00:51:33,688
His mother ran off
with another seal.

1006
00:51:35,024 --> 00:51:36,252
ls he good to you?

1007
00:51:36,292 --> 00:51:37,987
Well, he's good to me
on the whole.

1008
00:51:39,328 --> 00:51:40,420
Only got one problem.

1009
00:51:40,463 --> 00:51:42,522
He won't ride in the backseat.

1010
00:51:42,565 --> 00:51:43,964
That's right...

1011
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,264
climbs over the back
and rides in front.

1012
00:51:46,302 --> 00:51:48,167
Now, l know
he's a good driver...

1013
00:51:50,573 --> 00:51:52,006
But who owns the car?

1014
00:51:52,074 --> 00:51:53,006
Right?

1015
00:51:53,075 --> 00:51:54,007
Right!

1016
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:56,977
Here.

1017
00:51:57,013 --> 00:51:58,742
Give him this.

1018
00:51:58,781 --> 00:52:00,373
Whoa. Thanks.

1019
00:52:23,339 --> 00:52:25,273
Well, this is it.

1020
00:52:38,621 --> 00:52:41,522
l don't know
why l'm building it.

1021
00:52:41,557 --> 00:52:43,525
Maybe it's for you.

1022
00:52:43,559 --> 00:52:44,856
Well, l think
it's great of you

1023
00:52:44,894 --> 00:52:45,986
to build a big house for me

1024
00:52:46,062 --> 00:52:48,087
without even knowing
what l look like.

1025
00:52:54,070 --> 00:52:55,799
l didn't know what kind
of a roof you wanted.

1026
00:52:58,274 --> 00:52:59,639
l don't need a roof.

1027
00:53:04,146 --> 00:53:05,272
What's that for?

1028
00:53:05,314 --> 00:53:06,508
The projector.

1029
00:53:06,549 --> 00:53:07,516
The what?

1030
00:53:07,550 --> 00:53:09,677
The movie projector.

1031
00:53:18,027 --> 00:53:19,927
l gave a luncheon
out here last week,

1032
00:53:19,962 --> 00:53:22,829
so l had some props
and grass brought out

1033
00:53:22,865 --> 00:53:24,696
to see how the place felt.

1034
00:53:24,734 --> 00:53:26,725
ls that real grass?

1035
00:53:26,769 --> 00:53:27,736
Sure.

1036
00:53:27,770 --> 00:53:28,862
ls it from a film set?

1037
00:53:28,904 --> 00:53:30,303
No.

1038
00:53:30,339 --> 00:53:31,397
Can l walk on it?

1039
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,203
Walk.

1040
00:53:33,242 --> 00:53:35,073
l'll watch you.

1041
00:54:11,647 --> 00:54:13,808
Will you live here alone?

1042
00:54:13,849 --> 00:54:14,873
Yes.

1043
00:54:16,085 --> 00:54:17,882
Alone with your movie projector?

1044
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,444
Mm-hmm.

1045
00:54:19,488 --> 00:54:20,716
Where do you live now?

1046
00:54:20,756 --> 00:54:21,882
l live in my old house.

1047
00:54:27,630 --> 00:54:29,962
What's this?

1048
00:54:30,065 --> 00:54:31,692
Oh, the, uh, swimming pool.

1049
00:54:31,734 --> 00:54:34,362
Or it will be
a swimming pool.

1050
00:54:34,403 --> 00:54:37,839
Well, you need a constant supply
of Nereids to...

1051
00:54:37,873 --> 00:54:39,465
plunge and gambol.

1052
00:54:39,508 --> 00:54:40,497
Nereids, what's that?
