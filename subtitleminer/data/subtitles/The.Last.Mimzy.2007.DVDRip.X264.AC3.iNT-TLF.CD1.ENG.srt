1
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:41,120
Ok, everybody.
Ready?

2
00:00:41,155 --> 00:00:42,635
Let's settle down.

3
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:47,290
Today I'm going to
show you a story.

4
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,990
Let's all tune in together.

5
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,715
<i>A long time ago...</i>

6
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:58,795
<i>...the soul of our planet was sick.</i>

7
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:01,840
<i>People had become isolated...</i>

8
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:03,310
<i>...and warlike.</i>

9
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:06,850
<i>Our world was frightened.</i>

10
00:01:06,885 --> 00:01:08,260
<i>It was dying.</i>

11
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:11,570
<i>But a great scientist...</i>

12
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:13,230
<i>...was trying to save us.</i>

13
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:17,375
<i>He had tried many times...</i>

14
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:22,360
<i>...and he knew
he could only try once more.</i>

15
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:25,700
<i>This was the last mimzy.</i>

16
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,430
It's gotta be my new braces.

17
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,345
I'm not a terrorist, ok?

18
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,800
Ah, you sure about that?
Let's see in your pockets.

19
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,770
That's the third time she's done that.

20
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,270
We're gonna be late for the test.

21
00:01:46,305 --> 00:01:47,235
Have you studied?

22
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:49,270
All night. I'm freaked out.

23
00:01:49,305 --> 00:01:50,270
C'mere.

24
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,230
Check your messages.

25
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,215
Whoa. Gee, thanks, man.

26
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,995
Courtesy of my cousin Bob.

27
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:02,530
Took the test last week. Cool.

28
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,150
Listen up. All right?

29
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,705
Now, just a reminder...

30
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:09,240
Science fair projects are
due one week after vacation.

31
00:02:09,275 --> 00:02:11,205
Oh, come on!

32
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,740
It's gonna be a great fair this year.

33
00:02:12,775 --> 00:02:14,250
There's lots of great exhibits.

34
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,670
Um, you have tests
sitting in front of you.

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,580
Noah, you're not an ameba.

36
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,665
You have a spine.
Use it, sit up straight.

37
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,250
That goes for all of you.
Come on, you guys.

38
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,760
Let's get focused here.

39
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:26,175
You have 30 minutes...

40
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:27,260
...and begin.

41
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,600
So, how d'you do?

42
00:02:36,635 --> 00:02:39,065
Total choke.

43
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,610
You didn't use the text I sent you.

44
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:44,410
Mr. White coughed. I think he saw.

45
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:47,200
You're such a wuss. Hey, look at this.

46
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,700
Whoa. I'm in the front...

47
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:50,700
I have times four.

48
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,045
Hey, dude,
d'you wanna come over?

49
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,340
Can't. Leaving for whidbey in an hour.

50
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,055
Whidbey?

51
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:02,055
For easter vacation?

52
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:05,930
- How lame!
- Tell me about it.

53
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,015
<i>Hey!</i>

54
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:13,020
<i>Oh, hey, sweetheart, how's it going?</i>

55
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:14,580
I packed up the car already.

56
00:03:14,615 --> 00:03:15,770
You were supposed to be home.

57
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,910
Listen, we're gonna leave
first thing in the morning.

58
00:03:17,945 --> 00:03:20,060
I promise. But you gotta tell the kids
there was nothing I could do about it.

59
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,900
- Oh, sweetheart.
- I'm sorry.

60
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:25,820
I'm gonna get home late
so eat without me, ok?

61
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,320
Emma, where are you?
We're eating.

62
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,615
- Coming, mom!
- Ok.

63
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:33,410
Know what? It snapped.

64
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:36,410
Oh, honey, sit down,
we can fix it later.

65
00:03:36,445 --> 00:03:37,375
Please.

66
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:41,420
No, you're the sensitive little genius.

67
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,920
Why don't you do it?

68
00:03:42,955 --> 00:03:44,420
I can't do it.

69
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,340
I don't have dexterity.

70
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:48,720
Dexterity? What kind of mutant are you?

71
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:50,275
Noah. Fine.

72
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,560
Where's the stupid string?

73
00:03:52,595 --> 00:03:54,810
It's in my stupid hand.

74
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:58,310
Why couldn't I have a normal sister
like everyone else?

75
00:03:58,367 --> 00:03:59,785
Come on, sit down...

76
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,190
So that we can eat like a family, ok?

77
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,495
Yuck!

78
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:08,490
They killed it!

79
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:09,940
How else would you eat it?

80
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,540
- Mommy, I don't understand.
- What?

81
00:04:12,575 --> 00:04:14,580
Why did they have to kill it?

82
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,870
He didn't do anything to anyone.

83
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,090
What about that chopped-up cow
you're eating?

84
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:22,420
What chopped-up cow?

85
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:24,290
What do you think hamburger is?

86
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:29,760
Did you have to?

87
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,860
You there?

88
00:04:44,895 --> 00:04:46,325
- Dad!
- Heh!

89
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,280
- You're home.
- Yeah.

90
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:52,700
Hey, I'm sorry about tonight, ok?

91
00:04:52,735 --> 00:04:55,175
Ok?

92
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:58,210
Oh, you're in a bad mood, are you?

93
00:04:58,245 --> 00:05:00,710
Is it 'cause i'm late?

94
00:05:00,745 --> 00:05:01,675
Hm? What is it?

95
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:03,080
Your sister or school, what is it?

96
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:04,800
School! School sucks!

97
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,465
Ok.

98
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,890
What else? Ahhh.

99
00:05:12,925 --> 00:05:14,355
What else?

100
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,390
- Life sucks.
- Life sucks.

101
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:18,365
- I suck.
- You suck.

102
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,295
All right. Well, just put
it on pause for a second...

103
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:24,190
...because I wanna tell you,
you're probably right.

104
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,480
Because sometimes life does suck...

105
00:05:26,515 --> 00:05:28,485
...and sometimes school sucks, but...

106
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,980
...you're completely wrong
on the Noah Wilder front.

107
00:05:31,015 --> 00:05:33,440
I should know, I mean
I've lived with him for...

108
00:05:33,475 --> 00:05:34,530
How old are you? 10?

109
00:05:34,565 --> 00:05:36,500
10 years.

110
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:39,950
And, uh, I will put it in writing...

111
00:05:39,985 --> 00:05:42,450
...money-back guarantee, full warranty...

112
00:05:42,485 --> 00:05:45,722
...whatever you want, to tell you...

113
00:05:45,757 --> 00:05:48,960
...that noah wilder does not suck.

114
00:05:48,995 --> 00:05:49,960
In fact...

115
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,010
...he's the greatest kid I know.

116
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:08,995
Y- Yeah? Yeah?

117
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:11,030
<i>Sorry, hope I didn't wake you up.</i>

118
00:06:11,065 --> 00:06:12,030
No, no.

119
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,505
Ah, no, no, listen...

120
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:18,040
If he accepts the motion, we're done.

121
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,040
Don't you dare,
I'll be there in 20 minutes.

122
00:06:20,075 --> 00:06:22,005
Oh!

123
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,410
Sorry, Jo. Take the kids
to Whidbey, I'll be there later.

124
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,860
Come on, get out.

125
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:56,660
Come on, sweetie. Get out!

126
00:06:56,695 --> 00:06:58,910
Isn't it pretty?

127
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,700
Oh, look at it, it is so beautiful!

128
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:10,710
I'll get the keys.

129
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,690
Oh, look at it!

130
00:07:23,725 --> 00:07:24,940
I love this place.

131
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:32,450
Oh, careful. You ok?

132
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:33,950
The magic staircase.

133
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:35,700
- Up you go.
- Magic?

134
00:07:35,735 --> 00:07:36,950
Well, kinda.

135
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:59,170
Noah, no!
Mommy said you have to wait!

136
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,975
Man, it's cold.

137
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:08,900
Oh, it's really cold.

138
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:13,570
Cold water.

139
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:16,360
What's that?

140
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:20,110
I don't know. I'll go see.

141
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:55,755
Let me.

142
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:56,980
No, don't.

143
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,570
I wonder if it opens.

144
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,890
What's that?

145
00:09:23,925 --> 00:09:25,605
I don't know.

146
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,115
Read the directions.

147
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,980
Do you see any directions?

148
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,150
<i>Come on in, guys.</i>

149
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,660
Keep it a secret.

150
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:56,670
Dinner's almost on,
you coming down?

151
00:09:56,705 --> 00:09:58,247
Yeah, in a sec.

152
00:09:58,282 --> 00:10:02,755
- What is that?
- Oh, it... I don't know.

153
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,130
Em and I found it on the beach.

154
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:06,220
Let me see.

155
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:11,720
Look at all those triangles.

156
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,020
Make a nice paperweight.

157
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:54,095
Mim... Mimzy.

158
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,130
Mimzy.

159
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:57,095
Mimzy?

160
00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:02,630
Mimzy.

161
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,615
What are you doing, Em?

162
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:08,640
Get out of my stuff.

163
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:11,605
What's that new stuff?

164
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,040
And what's that bunny rabbit?

165
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:13,980
Where'd they come from?

166
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:15,310
She was on the side.

167
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,775
No she wasn't.

168
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:19,320
I think she's the easter bunny.

169
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:21,190
Ya-Da-Da da-Da.
Give me that.

170
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,600
Give this to me. No.

171
00:12:22,635 --> 00:12:23,440
- Give it...
- No.

172
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:27,070
Now look what you did.
Give me those.

173
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:42,590
What are they for?

174
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,050
It's like she's talking to me.

175
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,470
Yeah, right.

176
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,450
Like this?

177
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:13,570
It's a spinner, Noah.

178
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:16,075
Uh...

179
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:17,545
What...

180
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,545
How did you do that?

181
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:22,550
I did like this.

182
00:13:22,585 --> 00:13:25,515
No, smooth.

183
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:27,330
Close your eyes.

184
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:30,090
What is this stuff?

185
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:37,060
Wow!

186
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:46,270
Whoa!

187
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:49,740
Oh, sheesh.

188
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,840
No, don't!

189
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,605
Are you crazy?

190
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,560
Do you even know what
just happened to your hand?

191
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:24,060
Is it ok?

192
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,450
This stuff could be dangerous.

193
00:14:30,485 --> 00:14:32,415
Maybe we should tell someone.

194
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:34,950
I showed the green glass thing to mom.

195
00:14:34,985 --> 00:14:37,450
She thought it was a paperweight.

196
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,960
Maybe other people
don't see what we see.

197
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:45,460
Maybe you can use these
for your science proje ct.

198
00:14:45,495 --> 00:14:48,970
I'm not even gonna do
a science project.

199
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:54,340
And I bet Mr. White couldn't care less.

200
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,200
- Morning, Mr. Willpower.
- Morning.

201
00:15:23,235 --> 00:15:24,717
I thought you were dieting.

202
00:15:24,752 --> 00:15:26,165
I thought you were meditating.

203
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,920
Aren't you supposed to be in Nirvana?

204
00:15:27,955 --> 00:15:30,225
I am.

205
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,460
Larry, are you seriously eating that?

206
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,260
I haven't had anything
to eat in 8 hours.

207
00:15:34,295 --> 00:15:36,100
Oh, really?
That's called sleeping.

208
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:38,300
Here. Come on.

209
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,560
Oh, my goodness.

210
00:15:39,595 --> 00:15:40,565
- Ha! No.
- Yes.

211
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,160
I am not so easily tempted.

212
00:15:42,195 --> 00:15:43,720
- What about him?
- Hey, stop it!

213
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,720
Ah, let me focus.

214
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:50,980
I had another one of
those dreams last night.

215
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,150
Were there any lotto numbers?

216
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,775
No, no numbers. Just that...

217
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:58,070
That same light and that...

218
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:00,070
Spinning mandala shape...

219
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:02,370
- Coming down at me.
- Oh, are you sure?

220
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:04,160
Because sometimes you forget.
Historically, you've been...

221
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:08,160
No, no numbers. Just, god,
ever since we left nepal...

222
00:16:08,195 --> 00:16:11,170
It's that same dream.
I don't get it.

223
00:16:11,205 --> 00:16:13,170
It's like the shape is...

224
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:15,670
...sucking me into it.

225
00:16:15,705 --> 00:16:16,670
It's... It...

226
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:18,135
Don't talk.

227
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:22,180
Just... Just try not to lose it.

228
00:16:22,215 --> 00:16:23,645
Just...

229
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,145
See if it can...

230
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:27,600
Come back to you, then...
you can remember...

231
00:16:27,635 --> 00:16:29,282
You're trying to get numbers out of me.

232
00:16:29,317 --> 00:16:30,930
- No, I'm not...
- There were no numbers.

233
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:35,235
It's so sad.

234
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:39,745
Oh, we could've been so rich.

235
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,780
Could you imagine how many
people we could've helped...

236
00:16:41,815 --> 00:16:43,547
...with that money?

237
00:16:43,582 --> 00:16:45,245
Naomi, let it go, ok?

238
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,080
It was a year and a half
a go, it just happened once.

239
00:16:47,115 --> 00:16:48,140
It was a total fluke.

240
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,830
Larry, you dreamt all six numbers
of a winning lottery ticket.

241
00:16:50,865 --> 00:16:53,610
- We could've won 18 million dollars.
- Million dollars, I know.

242
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:55,290
How was that a fluke, larry?

243
00:16:55,325 --> 00:16:56,790
Come on, I'm sorry. I know.

244
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,300
Oh, really?
Is this what's going on right now?

245
00:17:00,335 --> 00:17:01,265
It is, mm-Hm.

246
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,800
You think you can just...

247
00:17:02,835 --> 00:17:04,265
...kiss your way back...
- I do.

248
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,300
You know what?
It's easter vacation, let's celebrate.

249
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:08,970
- You're not allowed to...
- Got you.

250
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:10,935
I tagged you.

251
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:12,945
- You're it.
- Oh...

252
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:15,650
You're not gonna get me,
you can't get me.

253
00:17:15,685 --> 00:17:16,615
You can't get me.

254
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:18,150
I'm gonna get you.

255
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,240
Em!

256
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:34,830
Oh. Man, that feels good.

257
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,850
You got some pretty
intact sand dollars there.

258
00:17:47,885 --> 00:17:49,850
They're nice.

259
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:52,070
Reminds me of Mr. White.

260
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:55,070
Try it. This is mimzy's shell.

261
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:47,740
<i>We'll find a shortwave frequency</i>

262
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,740
<i>The wave connecting you and me</i>

263
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,750
<i>Hello, I love you</i>

264
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,040
Sweet!

265
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:23,050
Wasn't that just
the most beautiful day, huh?

266
00:20:23,085 --> 00:20:24,550
The beach...

267
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:29,590
Sweetie, come here, I'm cold,
I need a cuddle.

268
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:32,645
Yeah, let's...
Aww.

269
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,680
That's good.
Now I'm nice and warm.

270
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:39,645
God, look at it.

271
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,490
It's so beautiful.

272
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:44,655
- I love this.
- Me too.

273
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:46,890
- Look at all the stars, mommy.
- Yeah.

274
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:50,255
It's so big.

275
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:53,700
Are we the only people
in the universe?

276
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:58,200
That is a very big question...

277
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:02,710
And, um, nobody really knows, honey.

278
00:21:02,745 --> 00:21:04,590
I don't think we are.

279
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,460
I think you're probably right.

280
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,425
So what do you say, guys?

281
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:11,880
Uh, how about we make
some s'mores, hm?

282
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,100
Well, actually, I'm not hungry.

283
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,855
I'm full too.

284
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:18,390
My tummy's so full
I'm gonna go upstairs.

285
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:22,890
M- Me too, I'm...
I'm kinda tired, em.

286
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,400
We can do s'mores tomorrow,
ok, mom?

287
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,955
I have a girlfriend named Marcie.

288
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:44,330
But she doesn't always like me.

289
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:46,830
She thinks I'm too smart.

290
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:48,840
And the girls in my class...

291
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:50,805
...don't talk to me.

292
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,840
Because I like astronomy...

293
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:54,305
...and I play the violin.

294
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:57,430
- Mimzy.
- I know, I'm your friend too.

295
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:00,400
Tea, ladies?

296
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,820
What's in there?

297
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:06,000
What did I just do?

298
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:07,625
How did you do that, Noah?

299
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,330
I don't know, with my brain?

300
00:23:09,365 --> 00:23:11,542
I just looked
at it and it...

301
00:23:11,577 --> 00:23:13,720
Disappeared.

302
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:20,230
It's not funny!

303
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:22,475
It is to me.

304
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:24,985
You better clean that up.

305
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:27,020
You're not the boss of me, ok?

306
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:34,020
Hey, Noah, Mimzy knows things.

307
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,280
Oh, yeah? What kind of things?

308
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:38,950
I think she reads minds.

309
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,950
She knows all about us.

310
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:42,385
Like what?

311
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,000
She knows our names...

312
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,465
...where we were born...

313
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,670
...and what kind of french fries I like.

314
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,260
That's nice.

315
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:52,275
And you know what else?

316
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:55,130
She said dad's gonna call.

317
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:59,550
That's daddy.

318
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,970
Come on, Mimz.

319
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:10,155
- Hey, guess what?
- I know. Daddy's coming.

320
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:13,780
Well, how do you know that?
He just called me from the car.

321
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:18,045
- Mimzy told me.
- Yeah, mimzy told her.

322
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:21,890
Daddy! Daddy's here!

323
00:24:21,925 --> 00:24:24,410
Daddy! Yay!

324
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:26,490
- Daddy, daddy, daddy!
- That's dad, all right.

325
00:24:26,525 --> 00:24:28,500
- Daddy's coming!
- Come on, let's go.

326
00:24:28,535 --> 00:24:30,000
- Hey, guys!
- Daddy, yay!

327
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,500
- Daddy's here!
- C'mere, Em.

328
00:24:32,535 --> 00:24:33,965
Hey, bud.

329
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,500
How are ya? Huh?

330
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,010
Oh, I'm happy to see you guys!

331
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:44,010
- Hi!
- Hey, you!

332
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:47,020
Home at last.

333
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:54,020
And they said
we're just looking for carrots...

334
00:24:54,055 --> 00:24:56,037
...and there was no carrots there.

335
00:24:56,072 --> 00:24:57,985
Mom, can you tell a joke? Oh.

336
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,030
And they were really
dreaming of carrots.

337
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:01,530
Come on, come on, tell a joke!

338
00:25:01,565 --> 00:25:04,030
- Hey, did you...
- Come on.

339
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:06,495
I don't know what's got into them.

340
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:09,540
You know, Emma, she just
hangs onto that rabbit...

341
00:25:09,575 --> 00:25:11,005
Day and night.

342
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,540
And Noah, it's just like
he's on another planet...

343
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,505
You know?

344
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:17,290
They're not my babies any more.

345
00:25:17,325 --> 00:25:20,765
Aww. No, it's true.

346
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,800
You know, we haven't
played one board game...

347
00:25:22,835 --> 00:25:24,265
...since we've been here.
Not one.

348
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,800
- Yeah?
- You know, we've barely talked...

349
00:25:25,835 --> 00:25:27,200
Apart from at dinner...

350
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:30,310
And then they run off
before they're done, I...

351
00:25:30,345 --> 00:25:33,187
It's really different, I...

352
00:25:33,222 --> 00:25:36,030
They're growing up.

353
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,480
They'll always be your babies, Jo.

354
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:40,980
Our babies.

355
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:47,410
- All right.
- Thanks, Mike.

356
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:49,995
Grab the bucket, ok.

357
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:52,265
All right, here we go.

358
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,000
This one's for you.

359
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,250
Why are you giving me a club?

360
00:25:56,285 --> 00:25:58,642
Dad, I'm not gonna play golf, am i?

361
00:25:58,677 --> 00:26:01,000
Ah, come on,
we're gonna give it a try.

362
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,020
All right.

363
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:23,280
Noah...

364
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,330
Come give it a try.

365
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:27,450
No, dad, you know I suck at sports.

366
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,750
Oh, now this is not a sport...

367
00:26:29,785 --> 00:26:31,750
This is an obsession. Come on.

368
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:35,360
Come on, you're gonna like this.

369
00:26:35,795 --> 00:26:36,760
Ok.

370
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:39,225
Now, you wanna line up, right?

371
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:42,760
There you go.
Just get in position.

372
00:26:42,795 --> 00:26:44,175
Now, you don't wanna kill it.

373
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:45,740
You don't wanna kill it, all right?

374
00:26:45,775 --> 00:26:47,235
You just wanna let the gravity...

375
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:51,770
...just glide the club
right down to the ball.

376
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:55,280
All right, now then,
it's not about strength...

377
00:26:55,315 --> 00:26:57,180
...it's about control.

378
00:26:57,815 --> 00:26:58,780
Ok?

379
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,780
You ready? Ho-Ho-Ho.
Hold on. Hold on.

380
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,780
Just want to see right
where you are here.

381
00:27:03,815 --> 00:27:04,780
Ok.

382
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,465
Whoa, baby!

383
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,500
I think we've found your sport.

384
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:06,420
And this, ladies and gentlemen...

385
00:28:06,455 --> 00:28:09,050
...is a basic outline
of the story of DNA...

386
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:11,050
And of the doctors Watson and Crick...

387
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:15,805
...who cracked the genetic code
that controls all living things.

388
00:28:16,095 --> 00:28:17,525
And we now believe...

389
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:20,060
...that genes don't just
control the way we look.

390
00:28:20,095 --> 00:28:23,060
But also how we think
and how we act...

391
00:28:23,095 --> 00:28:24,025
...and how we feel.

392
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:27,870
So, when people mess
with mother nature...

393
00:28:27,905 --> 00:28:29,835
Look out.

394
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:32,320
Because pollutants can change us.

395
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:34,790
And not just chemical
and biological ones...

396
00:28:34,825 --> 00:28:36,740
Cultural ones as well.

397
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:40,210
Perfectly good DNA
becomes a bunch of useless junk...

398
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:43,420
...carried from
generation to generation.

399
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,920
And, uh, as a case in point
I'd like you to meet...

400
00:28:45,955 --> 00:28:48,510
...a very special friend of mine.

401
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:50,975
This is Charlie.

402
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:53,260
He'd like to say hello,
he's a little shy.

403
00:28:54,095 --> 00:28:55,710
How you doin'?
You don't wanna come out?

404
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:57,010
No, I think you should.

405
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:00,820
Gotcha!

406
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:04,565
Ew! Gross!

407
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,910
Oh, yes...

408
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:08,110
Gross, oh, that's right.

409
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:11,845
This is what happens when
you screw with the code.

410
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:15,080
And don't tell your parents
i said the word "screw".

411
00:29:15,115 --> 00:29:16,045
Please.

412
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,590
This is what happens
when pollutants...

413
00:29:18,625 --> 00:29:21,465
...contaminate DNA.

414
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:24,095
Let Charlie be a warning.
This could happen to us.

415
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:26,660
You wanna end up with two heads?
I don't think so.

416
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:28,595
This can happen to all living things...

417
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:31,680
And in fact, it may be
happening right now.

418
00:29:32,215 --> 00:29:34,180
Then why don't they do something?

419
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,600
Why don't they stop it?

420
00:29:35,635 --> 00:29:36,912
Excellent question, Wendy.

421
00:29:36,947 --> 00:29:39,947
"Why don't they do something?"
"Why don't they stop it"?

422
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:42,690
Who is this "they" that
wendy's referring to...

423
00:29:42,725 --> 00:29:43,925
I wonder, huh?

424
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:45,153
What do you think?

425
00:29:45,605 --> 00:29:47,627
"They" is all of us.

426
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:49,430
Right?

427
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:53,950
Ok, thank you.
We'll see you on wednesday.

428
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:59,130
Keep working on your
science fair projects.

429
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,260
You play golf?

430
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,725
No. What's goin' on?

431
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,245
Nothing's going on, I mean...

432
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,730
I was bored out of my mind.

433
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,610
Noah! Noah, do you have a sec?

434
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:29,990
I need to talk to you about this.

435
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:31,285
Yeah.

436
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,795
I'm outta here, dude.

437
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:35,110
Just relax, Noah, it's ok.
It's not about the test...

438
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:36,375
It's about this.

439
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:39,920
Um... Hey, did you, uh,
did you draw this?

440
00:30:39,955 --> 00:30:41,885
Yeah.

441
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,885
Ok. Uh, what was your inspiration?

442
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,870
I mean, where did you
come up with this design?

443
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:47,710
I was just scribbling.

444
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:49,145
I do it all the time.

445
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:52,180
And I've got a whole bookful.

446
00:30:52,215 --> 00:30:53,565
May I?

447
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,180
Here are a few of 'em.

448
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,145
That is incredible.

449
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:00,690
My favorite one...
There's a few.

450
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:06,655
Beautiful.

451
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:08,230
Do you know what these are called?

452
00:31:08,265 --> 00:31:09,030
No.

453
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:10,810
They're actually called mandalas.

454
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:13,320
- Have you ever seen one before?
- Mandalas.

455
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:15,785
No. Never...

456
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:17,785
Heard of one or seen.

457
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:19,285
Noah, would it be all right...

458
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:22,160
If I borrowed these for a little while?

459
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:23,990
Borrow all you want.

460
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:27,620
Trade you for an A.
Only kiddin'. See ya.

461
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:31,295
Sure it's not in one of the other books?

462
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:33,340
No, it's in here,
it's one of the old ones.

463
00:31:33,375 --> 00:31:34,670
I know I've seen it.

464
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:38,380
There it is.

465
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,945
I knew it.

466
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,680
It's 12th century,
it's one of the oldest known.

467
00:31:43,715 --> 00:31:45,447
Oh, my god...

468
00:31:45,482 --> 00:31:47,145
That is incredible.

469
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:49,190
It's almost an exact match.

470
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:52,160
And you know something else?

471
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:57,110
This is the same image...

472
00:31:57,145 --> 00:31:58,950
...from my dream.

473
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:01,660
Larry...

474
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:30,155
Hey, Noah...

475
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:31,640
You know what time it is?

476
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:33,200
Yeah, I know, it's late, but...

477
00:32:33,235 --> 00:32:34,665
You gotta see this.

478
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:37,700
What is this? I mean
it's way past your bedtime, bud.

479
00:32:37,735 --> 00:32:40,200
It's... Uh...

480
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,175
What is that?

481
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:46,710
It's part of my exhibit
for the science fair at school.

482
00:32:46,745 --> 00:32:48,660
It's amazing, how did you do that?

483
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,125
It was easy.

484
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:53,130
First i discovered that spiders
are sensitive to sound waves...

485
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:56,170
...and seem to move when they
hear various frequencies.

486
00:32:56,205 --> 00:32:59,170
Then I experimented
with the frequencies...

487
00:32:59,205 --> 00:33:02,680
...to make them move in
specific patterns.

488
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:05,180
I calculated their movements
with my computer...

489
00:33:05,215 --> 00:33:07,145
...and I re-programmed them.

490
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:11,180
Their circular webs started changing
into something more elongated.

491
00:33:11,215 --> 00:33:12,490
I call it...

492
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:15,190
...the structured bridge.

493
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:21,680
This geometric design is
extraordinarily strong...

494
00:33:21,715 --> 00:33:24,450
...and would be equal to
a beam that could hold...

495
00:33:24,485 --> 00:33:26,500
...1,000 pounds per square inch.

496
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:30,320
Did he do this on his own?
Did you help him?

497
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:32,425
No, he's done it all by himself.

498
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:35,460
He's just, sort of,
taken off all of a sudden.

499
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,960
You know,
in the last month or so.

500
00:33:37,995 --> 00:33:39,960
His sister is highly gifted too.

501
00:33:39,995 --> 00:33:40,960
Mm. No, no, no, no.

502
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:43,470
This is more than highly gifted.

503
00:33:43,505 --> 00:33:44,935
This is genius.

504
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:47,970
He's gonna win the
national science fair.

505
00:33:48,005 --> 00:33:50,970
<i>...that exist today,
a bridge of this type...</i>

506
00:33:51,005 --> 00:33:54,140
...could span
the entire solar system.

507
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:03,035
Are there any questions?

508
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:05,140
"It was brillig and the slithy toves...

509
00:34:05,175 --> 00:34:07,192
"Did gyre and gimble in the wabe...

510
00:34:07,227 --> 00:34:09,210
"All mimzy were the borogoves...

511
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,210
"And the mome raths outgrabe."

512
00:34:11,245 --> 00:34:12,960
Wait, did that say mimzy?

513
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,080
Uh, yep.

514
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:15,750
Let me see.

515
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:19,175
Look, she's got mimzy too.

516
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:21,250
- With the white rabbit?
- Yeah.

517
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,430
- Ok.
- And this is mimzy.

518
00:34:23,465 --> 00:34:25,220
She came here to find me.

519
00:34:25,255 --> 00:34:26,645
I don't know why.

520
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:29,145
White rabbit, just like in the book.

521
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:31,180
You know, he was the one
who was always late...

522
00:34:31,215 --> 00:34:32,680
...for a very important date.

523
00:34:34,987 --> 00:34:36,655
Where did you get it?

524
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:39,055
We found her on the beach.

525
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:42,190
Noah thinks she's from outer space...

526
00:34:42,225 --> 00:34:43,660
But he doesn't really know.

527
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:45,500
Outer space.

528
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:47,280
Do you believe in aliens?

529
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:51,120
Aliens? Like flying saucers
and things like that?

530
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:53,950
Yeah, I guess I do, sort of.

531
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:55,290
Noah does too.

532
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:56,670
Oh, well... boys.

533
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:01,090
Do you think aliens
would ever come here?

534
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:03,510
Some people think they
might be here right now...

535
00:35:03,545 --> 00:35:04,510
...and we don't even know it.

536
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:06,485
Really?

537
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,890
But what do they want?

538
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:10,765
I don't know.

539
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,020
Noah doesn't know
if they're good or bad...

540
00:35:13,055 --> 00:35:15,020
They might help us or kill us...

541
00:35:15,055 --> 00:35:17,030
...or maybe steal our brains.

542
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,860
Steal our brains?

543
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:25,350
If I show you something
promise you won't tell?

544
00:35:26,377 --> 00:35:28,700
Oh. Like... a secret?

545
00:35:28,735 --> 00:35:30,175
Really? Cool!

546
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:31,675
What kind of secret?

547
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:34,210
I can do a magic trick
with my hand.

548
00:35:34,245 --> 00:35:36,202
Really? Yeah. Show me.

549
00:35:36,237 --> 00:35:38,160
Ok.
Whoop... Thank you.

550
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:59,485
That's, um... That's...

551
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,020
That's a really great magic trick, Em.

552
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,160
Honey, c'mere.

553
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,080
Sweetheart, please, come here!

554
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,670
Come here, ok? No!

555
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:18,340
- Oh, my god.
- It's ok.

556
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,840
It doesn't hurt.
Watch.

557
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:25,645
Oh, my god! No! No! No! Uh!

558
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,680
Julie! Julie! Wait up! What's
wrong? Don't you wanna get pai d?

559
00:36:27,715 --> 00:36:28,675
I... I gotta go!
I gotta go home!

560
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:31,600
- Julie, what's wrong?
- Honey, are you ok?

561
00:36:31,635 --> 00:36:33,600
- What happened?
- Nothing.

562
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,525
What happened?
What did you do?

563
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:40,560
Nothing, daddy.
I just showed her a magic trick.

564
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:50,700
You know what?
I'll call Julie in the morning.

565
00:36:50,735 --> 00:36:51,665
I'm sure it was nothing.

566
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:54,290
It's not just Julie...

567
00:36:54,325 --> 00:36:56,755
It's everything.

568
00:36:56,790 --> 00:37:00,300
I mean what about
Noah's science project, huh?

569
00:37:00,735 --> 00:37:03,100
How did he do that
all by himself?

570
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,800
I mean, usually he struggles,
he needs my help...

571
00:37:05,835 --> 00:37:07,920
...and suddenly he's in
a league of his own.

572
00:37:07,955 --> 00:37:09,885
I mean, something is just not right.

573
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,390
What's not right? Look,
we got two special kids...

574
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:13,890
...with great minds,
imaginations, it's...

575
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:15,600
No, you're not getting it!

576
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:18,115
You know, I'm scared. I...

577
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:20,100
That... It's... It's
just not normal.

578
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,535
Don't talk like that.

579
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:22,970
Look, you're overreacting
to this whole...

580
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:25,440
David, stop it. Open your eyes.

581
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:27,320
I think we need to do something.

582
00:37:27,355 --> 00:37:29,330
We have to get help.

583
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:36,530
Yeah, well, all right,
we'll get help. Um...

584
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:40,140
What kinda help?

585
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,650
No! Uh!

586
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:25,435
What was that?

587
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:26,810
Hey, George! What's goin' on?

588
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:28,190
Stop messin' around, this isn't funny.

589
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,445
Whoa, I just lost power in sector 4.

590
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,070
Keith, see if you can't rerout
power through substation 5.

591
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,450
Sector 3's offline.

592
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:39,765
Homeland security?

593
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,790
Yeah, no kidding.

594
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:42,290
Oh, my gosh.

595
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:54,300
- Hey, Noah, you all right?
- Daddy, what's happening?

596
00:39:54,335 --> 00:39:55,810
Hey, sweetie. It's...
It's a blackout.

597
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:58,060
The whole neighborhood's dark.

598
00:39:58,095 --> 00:39:59,610
Did you guys hear that sound?

599
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:02,810
They're saying that it's
blacked out half the state.

600
00:40:02,845 --> 00:40:04,260
Unbelievable.

601
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:06,320
They don't know what's caused it.

602
00:40:06,355 --> 00:40:07,785
No, well, they...
They will.

603
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:10,270
They always know exactly
how these things start.

604
00:40:10,305 --> 00:40:11,690
- They do?
- Oh, yeah.

605
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,770
- Yeah!
- That didn't last long.

606
00:40:15,307 --> 00:40:16,740
Are you ok?

607
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:19,665
I'm goin' down there now.

608
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,700
Oh, man, it's been a crazy morning.

609
00:40:21,735 --> 00:40:23,700
The FBI, the Pentagon's been calling.

610
00:40:23,735 --> 00:40:26,472
Look, I can't talk right now, Bill.

611
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:29,175
Well, somebody has to have the keys.

612
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:31,710
Look, Bill, just get
everybody down there now.

613
00:40:31,745 --> 00:40:33,175
- It's Lorna.
- Who?

614
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:35,460
Your daughter, Nate.
She wants to know what's happening.

615
00:40:35,495 --> 00:40:37,710
Tell her so does the president,
he wants to know too.

616
00:40:37,745 --> 00:40:39,220
Hey, baby, you know where
my computer codes are?

617
00:40:39,255 --> 00:40:40,920
He'll call you back, honey.

618
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:44,020
Did you try your dresser,
under your underwear?

619
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,185
Ahh, got it.

620
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:50,695
I knew you should
never have agreed to this.

621
00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:52,730
You had a perfectly good job
at the justice department...

622
00:40:52,765 --> 00:40:55,230
And now, all of a sudden,
you're a terrorism expert.

623
00:40:55,265 --> 00:40:58,295
Look, baby,
the national director appointed me.

624
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:00,370
What do you want me to do,
call in sick?

625
00:41:00,405 --> 00:41:02,120
But no one ever
actually thought you'd...

626
00:41:02,155 --> 00:41:03,410
I mean, this is Seattle, Nate.

627
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:05,070
Why would terrorists attack Seattle?

628
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:06,960
I don't know, Sheila.
Look, we got the Boeing plant...

629
00:41:06,995 --> 00:41:08,425
We got Microsoft...

630
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:10,045
We got the music experience.

631
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:14,130
I don't know, babe.
I gotta go.

632
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:17,090
I'll call you later, baby.

633
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:18,470
- Nate...
- Huh?

634
00:41:18,505 --> 00:41:19,355
- Your fly.
- Who?

635
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:20,640
Zip up your fly.

636
00:41:20,675 --> 00:41:21,890
Oh, oh, thank you.

637
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:23,890
Oh, thank you.
I love you, baby.

638
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:29,265
It grew right in front of my eyes.

639
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:32,020
I moved stuff inside the crystal...

640
00:41:32,055 --> 00:41:34,520
And then... then whoosh.

641
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:37,275
Half of the state blacked out.

642
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:39,530
What do you think it is, noah?

643
00:41:39,565 --> 00:41:40,825
I don't know...

644
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:42,905
But we have to throw it out.

645
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,915
All of them, all of the toys.

646
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:47,700
Everything, it's just too dangerous.

647
00:41:47,701 --> 00:41:48,500
No!

648
00:41:48,830 --> 00:41:50,750
Em, what if something
terrible's about to happen?

649
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,790
- That won't happen.
- How do you know?

650
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:53,960
Mimzy told me.

651
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:56,290
Mimzy, she's one of them.

652
00:41:56,325 --> 00:41:58,290
She came with them.

653
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:22,030
...tesseract.
Acute, hexagon. Rhomboid...

654
00:42:22,065 --> 00:42:24,650
Acute, tesseract, pyramidal, octahedron...

655
00:42:24,685 --> 00:42:26,070
Acute, helix...

656
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:45,590
Whoa!

657
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,480
Good morning.
Good morning, everyone.

658
00:42:49,515 --> 00:42:51,365
- Morning.
- Morning, sir.

659
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,480
For those of you who don't know,
I'm regional director Nathaniel Broadman.

660
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:58,955
And this is briefing one of alert 22d.

661
00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:01,490
I think this is the day we've
been training for, everybody.

662
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:04,110
Training? Nate, we’ve only had
two meetings.

663
00:43:04,330 --> 00:43:05,875
And thank god for those.

664
00:43:05,910 --> 00:43:09,420
Look, we're gonna do this right,
we're gonna do it by the book.

665
00:43:09,455 --> 00:43:10,920
Stu, you're up first.
What do you got?

666
00:43:10,955 --> 00:43:12,330
This is from NSA, uh...

667
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:13,840
Global positioning has zeroed in...

668
00:43:14,290 --> 00:43:17,340
On the Queen Anne section of Seattle.

669
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:19,120
No suspicious net chatter.

670
00:43:19,290 --> 00:43:22,280
How could a surge like that originate
from a residential neighborhood?

671
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,100
That's what we wanna find out.

672
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:26,670
I got a very bad feeling about this one.

673
00:43:27,850 --> 00:43:29,440
This is important.

674
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:33,360
No, I'm not taking them
to the emergency room.

675
00:43:33,395 --> 00:43:35,810
Look, uh, I know Dr. Sherman very well.

676
00:43:35,845 --> 00:43:37,810
Please get him to call me.

677
00:43:40,810 --> 00:43:42,785
Eat up, guys.

678
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:44,220
Can you get me some orange juice?

679
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:47,820
Can you "please" get me
some orange juice?

680
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:54,710
I had a strange dream last night.

681
00:43:56,210 --> 00:43:57,660
I dreamed about a bridge.

682
00:44:04,170 --> 00:44:08,170
- What kind of bridge?
- I don't know what kind.

683
00:44:08,171 --> 00:44:11,640
I dreamed that they were
gonna build a really big one.

684
00:44:11,675 --> 00:44:15,010
Across the whole universe.

685
00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:16,400
And you know what?

686
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:20,350
It's gonna come right to our house.

687
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:26,830
- Hello, Noah.
- Mr. White.

688
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:28,580
- Who is it, Noah?
- Is your mother ar...

689
00:44:28,615 --> 00:44:30,575
Oh, hello, Mrs. Wilder.

690
00:44:30,610 --> 00:44:32,295
I'm so sorry to barge in
on you like this.

691
00:44:32,330 --> 00:44:33,830
I was gonna call
but I thought it would be better...

692
00:44:34,330 --> 00:44:35,830
...if I came by in person.

693
00:44:35,865 --> 00:44:38,717
This is my fiance Naomi.

694
00:44:38,752 --> 00:44:40,370
- Hello.
- Do you have a minute?

695
00:44:40,590 --> 00:44:42,260
- Uh, sure, come on in.
- Great.

696
00:44:42,295 --> 00:44:43,260
Ok, thank you.

697
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:49,470
Uh, please, sit down.

698
00:44:52,970 --> 00:44:56,720
Uh, Noah, do you think your mother and I
could have a moment or two alone, please?

699
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:07,720
