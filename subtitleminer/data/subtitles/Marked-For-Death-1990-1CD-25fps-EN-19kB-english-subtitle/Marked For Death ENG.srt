1
00:01:26,933 --> 00:01:29,811
Did you talk to anyone?
Look at me. Talk to anybody?

2
00:01:29,893 --> 00:01:33,442
Did you see anybody?
Did you talk to anybody, huh?

3
00:01:33,533 --> 00:01:35,683
Did you make a phone call?

4
00:01:37,373 --> 00:01:39,762
Who did you talk to?

5
00:01:52,853 --> 00:01:54,844
You got anything else to say?

6
00:01:54,933 --> 00:01:56,924
I didn't think so.

7
00:02:01,133 --> 00:02:04,728
- How long was he out of your sight?
- Maybe a couple of minutes.

8
00:02:04,813 --> 00:02:07,452
Chico, I'm disappointed in you!
How could you do that?

9
00:02:07,533 --> 00:02:11,492
We can't go into that meeting.
If anyone was ever made, we were made.

10
00:02:11,733 --> 00:02:14,088
You know what I say? We're goin'.

11
00:02:15,253 --> 00:02:19,405
What are you? Are you crazy? Probably
a hundred people saw us chasing him.

12
00:02:19,493 --> 00:02:25,011
Chico, since when did anybody
ever accuse me of being sane?

13
00:02:25,093 --> 00:02:28,881
- We're goin'. All right? Come on.
- Jesus Christ!

14
00:03:30,653 --> 00:03:34,931
- You see anything strange?
- Just the usual weirdness.

15
00:03:39,613 --> 00:03:42,002
The deal's goin' down, man.

16
00:03:44,213 --> 00:03:47,011
- Keep an eye out for me, huh?
- Right, Hatcher.

17
00:03:49,253 --> 00:03:52,006
- Are you sure it's cool?
- It's very cool. Relax.

18
00:03:52,093 --> 00:03:54,971
- Good. Then let's go.
- Bueno.

19
00:03:55,053 --> 00:03:58,762
And the next time, you're gonna
introduce me to Salazar, aren't you?

20
00:03:58,853 --> 00:04:01,765
Yes, I promise. You got it.

21
00:04:06,093 --> 00:04:08,243
No traigo dinero. No tengo dinero.

22
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:10,893
No tengo dinero. No traigo.

23
00:04:14,973 --> 00:04:16,850
Bien. Bien, primo.

24
00:04:18,733 --> 00:04:20,803
Here we are, gentlemen. Right on time.

25
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:24,522
You see, I told you.
This guy, he's been a good customer.

26
00:04:25,413 --> 00:04:30,043
- Did you bring the green?
- Of course. I got it right here.

27
00:04:34,213 --> 00:04:35,965
Half.

28
00:04:36,053 --> 00:04:38,647
- Then what are you here for?
- To do business.

29
00:04:38,733 --> 00:04:41,327
If you don't like that, then I'll take off.

30
00:04:42,413 --> 00:04:44,529
Cálmate. Cálmate, primo.

31
00:04:44,933 --> 00:04:47,572
You know somethin'?
I do business for a long time.

32
00:04:47,653 --> 00:04:51,487
You know why? Cos I'm careful.
You can never be too careful, right?

33
00:04:52,053 --> 00:04:55,443
Careful is good with me, amigo.
Careful never killed nobody.

34
00:04:55,533 --> 00:04:58,252
- Is that right?
- Stupid.

35
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:02,042
Stupid kills. ¿Me entiendes?
OK, gringo. I think we can do business.

36
00:05:02,133 --> 00:05:04,442
Good. Then let's get it over with.

37
00:05:04,973 --> 00:05:07,089
Hey. How ya doin'?

38
00:05:18,373 --> 00:05:20,364
Hey, Colonel!

39
00:05:34,653 --> 00:05:39,329
You know, in our country... we love cops.

40
00:05:39,813 --> 00:05:43,886
And when we do a cop,
it's like a tremendous status symbol.

41
00:05:44,413 --> 00:05:48,850
But an American cop is like a gift from God.

42
00:05:48,933 --> 00:05:51,686
My little friend
is gonna open you up a little bit

43
00:05:51,773 --> 00:05:55,561
so you can tell us where
the rest of the money is, huh?

44
00:05:55,653 --> 00:05:59,407
- There is no more money.
- There's gotta be more money.

45
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:14,006
Hatcher, let's get the hell
outta here! Come on!

46
00:06:15,693 --> 00:06:17,763
Cover me!

47
00:06:18,893 --> 00:06:20,724
- It's clear!
- Let's go!

48
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:21,643
OK!

49
00:06:38,973 --> 00:06:40,804
Por favor, no más.

50
00:06:58,173 --> 00:06:59,401
Hatch!

51
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:04,324
Time to go, Hatch.

52
00:07:36,973 --> 00:07:38,964
I knew the only justice I could get

53
00:07:39,053 --> 00:07:43,171
would be that that I made for myself -
not always by law.

54
00:07:44,013 --> 00:07:47,323
Father... I just killed a woman.

55
00:07:49,973 --> 00:07:53,329
I've lied, I've slept with informants,

56
00:07:53,413 --> 00:07:57,008
I've taken drugs, I've falsified evidence.

57
00:07:57,093 --> 00:08:00,563
I did whatever I had to do to get the bad guys.

58
00:08:02,613 --> 00:08:05,286
And then I realised somethin'.

59
00:08:07,173 --> 00:08:10,131
That I had become what I most despise.

60
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:14,612
- Do you have a family?
- Yes, Father.

61
00:08:14,693 --> 00:08:18,049
Go to them and leave these things.

62
00:08:18,133 --> 00:08:23,207
Try to find the gentle self inside you.
Allow this person to come back.

63
00:08:29,373 --> 00:08:32,922
Well, what are you
going to retire to, Hatcher?

64
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:35,766
You're up to your neck in this life.

65
00:08:37,853 --> 00:08:40,606
I got Bennett burning up
the phone lines every day.

66
00:08:40,693 --> 00:08:45,005
I got the president going on television -
promising results, for Christ's sake.

67
00:08:45,093 --> 00:08:48,085
This is not the time for you
to walk out on me. Not now.

68
00:08:48,173 --> 00:08:50,767
- You can't!
- I've had enough.

69
00:08:53,413 --> 00:08:55,802
Look, John...

70
00:08:57,693 --> 00:09:00,571
There was nothing
you could have done to save Chico.

71
00:09:00,653 --> 00:09:04,885
These things happen when you're in deep.
You know that. Take a leave.

72
00:09:04,973 --> 00:09:06,770
With pay.

73
00:09:06,853 --> 00:09:10,892
Hell, take a month. Take two.
You've felt burned out before this.

74
00:09:10,973 --> 00:09:13,487
I need you, John, OK?

75
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:20,371
Pete, nothin' we ever did
amounted to shit, and you know it.

76
00:10:12,053 --> 00:10:15,045
- Who is it?
- Uncle John.

77
00:10:19,013 --> 00:10:22,050
You're not my uncle.
My Uncle John lives far away.

78
00:10:22,533 --> 00:10:25,730
I am your uncle.
And you've grown up to be a big girl.

79
00:10:27,373 --> 00:10:29,489
You allergic to cats?

80
00:10:29,573 --> 00:10:31,928
- Nope.
- OK. Then you can come in.

81
00:10:32,013 --> 00:10:34,402
Tracey, come on back...

82
00:10:34,933 --> 00:10:36,651
Johnny?

83
00:10:36,733 --> 00:10:40,487
- Johnny! I can't believe it.
- How's my little sister?

84
00:10:46,413 --> 00:10:49,689
- Boys, say hello to your Uncle John.
- Who's this?

85
00:10:49,773 --> 00:10:52,685
- This is Ricky.
- Ricky, how ya doin'? You look great.

86
00:10:52,773 --> 00:10:57,369
- You look good. Everything's all right?
- Yeah. Everything's great.

87
00:10:57,453 --> 00:11:00,411
- Hey, how you doin'?
- All right. Welcome home.

88
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:04,042
- Where you been?
- I've been here waitin' for you.

89
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:10,001
You're home!

90
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:15,410
Let me look at you. Oh, you look great.

91
00:11:15,493 --> 00:11:18,883
You look great.
You look like Melissa now. 20 years younger.

92
00:11:18,973 --> 00:11:24,093
Thank you. I accept all compliments
from handsome men. Everything all right?

93
00:11:24,173 --> 00:11:28,132
- You sounded strange on the phone.
- It's all right. I'm just a little tired.

94
00:11:28,413 --> 00:11:30,722
You've come to the right place to rest.

95
00:13:28,733 --> 00:13:30,724
Head up!

96
00:13:43,293 --> 00:13:45,727
- Cool!
- Make you 'appy?

97
00:13:45,813 --> 00:13:49,010
We have lots more
where dat come from, yuh know.

98
00:13:49,573 --> 00:13:52,167
Don't worry about it. Be 'appy!

99
00:13:53,293 --> 00:13:55,284
- Ready?
- Break!

100
00:13:59,813 --> 00:14:01,804
Let's go! Let's go!

101
00:14:03,013 --> 00:14:05,208
Come up to the play!

102
00:14:05,293 --> 00:14:08,569
Play it again! One more time!
Harris, you're a failure!

103
00:14:08,653 --> 00:14:12,885
Tackling 10 yards down the field ain't shit!
Pardon my French. Get back in the huddle!

104
00:14:12,973 --> 00:14:16,522
- Come on! Let's go!
- Coach! Coach, put me in!

105
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:19,764
Put me in.

106
00:14:21,013 --> 00:14:23,004
I'll be damned.

107
00:14:23,573 --> 00:14:26,167
- Trouble.
- That's me.

108
00:14:27,853 --> 00:14:33,689
- I heard you were shot dead in Bangkok.
- Well, I was in Bangkok. I was there.

109
00:14:33,773 --> 00:14:36,924
But I didn't get shot,
if that's all right with you.

110
00:14:37,013 --> 00:14:39,004
Hell, yeah!

111
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:46,724
- Coach, we're ready!
- Be right back. Show him you can play ball!

112
00:14:46,813 --> 00:14:50,567
You know, if you like dat,
you shoulda try some o' dis ting right here.

113
00:14:50,653 --> 00:14:54,202
Send you right to heaven.
Make cloud nine look sof'.

114
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:57,729
- Is that crack?
- Dat it is, man. You know, the real deal.

115
00:14:57,813 --> 00:15:00,646
- The shit you hear about on de news.
- It's funny

116
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:05,090
how de man always tell lie about
certain tings what make us 'appy.

117
00:15:05,173 --> 00:15:08,483
But you don't waan' try dis. It too tough.

118
00:15:08,573 --> 00:15:11,531
Women, it make dem wan' love
all the time, yuh know.

119
00:15:11,613 --> 00:15:13,843
- I'll try it.
- Sure ting, pretty girl.

120
00:15:13,933 --> 00:15:16,925
Go on. Put it right up to your lips. You ready?

121
00:15:17,013 --> 00:15:20,403
- Break!
- Four laps, then hit the showers!

122
00:15:22,173 --> 00:15:24,482
You were gone so long
you missed my marriage.

123
00:15:24,573 --> 00:15:27,371
- How was it?
- Cambodia was more fun.

124
00:15:27,453 --> 00:15:30,570
I love giving away my possessions!
It makes me feel spiritual.

125
00:15:30,653 --> 00:15:32,723
- And probably poor.
- And poor.

126
00:15:46,453 --> 00:15:48,842
It's all right. Let's go.

127
00:15:49,453 --> 00:15:53,446
Get in the car. Get in the car.
Get in the car. Get in the car.

128
00:16:40,653 --> 00:16:44,965
Tito Barco, we're glad you come
to show some respect.

129
00:16:45,733 --> 00:16:48,167
Walk up.

130
00:16:51,653 --> 00:16:54,292
- Check him clean.
- Cool.

131
00:16:54,373 --> 00:16:56,762
Do your best, man.

132
00:16:59,573 --> 00:17:01,564
Deja.

133
00:17:05,253 --> 00:17:07,972
You very funny, man.

134
00:17:11,173 --> 00:17:13,562
Wait 'ere for de man.

135
00:17:29,413 --> 00:17:31,802
Forward.

136
00:17:38,133 --> 00:17:42,285
You move into my territory.
What do you think I'm going to do?

137
00:17:42,373 --> 00:17:45,490
The streets will be red with blood,
and nobody makes money.

138
00:17:45,573 --> 00:17:50,124
They don't even notice us.
We fit in. We look like them.

139
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:56,842
But you... you go marching into the suburbs
with your rag-head soldiers,

140
00:17:57,173 --> 00:17:59,289
and we're front-page news.

141
00:17:59,373 --> 00:18:03,685
The DEA will be crawling down our throats
long after you've gone!

142
00:18:04,053 --> 00:18:06,647
Everybody waan' go heaven,

143
00:18:07,773 --> 00:18:10,162
but nobody want dead.

144
00:18:12,093 --> 00:18:14,084
Afraid?

145
00:18:28,613 --> 00:18:31,002
Dis is how it a go.

146
00:18:32,213 --> 00:18:34,727
You are work for I man now.

147
00:18:35,053 --> 00:18:37,806
You... a do the sellin'.

148
00:18:38,213 --> 00:18:40,681
You... a be the mule.

149
00:18:42,373 --> 00:18:45,490
I supply the crack and the powder.

150
00:18:45,893 --> 00:18:49,806
- What's the split?
- 20 per cent

151
00:18:50,133 --> 00:18:52,124
to you.

152
00:18:58,813 --> 00:19:02,169
Give me some time
to consider your proposition.

153
00:19:02,533 --> 00:19:05,969
I will give you an answer very soon.

154
00:19:07,093 --> 00:19:09,163
I'll wait

155
00:19:09,253 --> 00:19:11,130
and watch.

156
00:19:11,213 --> 00:19:14,205
I an' I see everyting.

157
00:19:16,493 --> 00:19:18,882
I an' I be everywhere.

158
00:19:30,493 --> 00:19:34,611
The santero told me that you are the one
with the most frightening power,

159
00:19:34,693 --> 00:19:37,207
that you are the one I must see.

160
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:51,168
This man is not only Abakua -
the leopard people -

161
00:19:51,253 --> 00:19:53,244
...pero también es maijumbero.

162
00:19:54,173 --> 00:19:56,209
Muy malo.

163
00:19:56,293 --> 00:19:59,842
This man is using the power of the spirits

164
00:19:59,933 --> 00:20:02,322
to do very evil things.

165
00:20:03,973 --> 00:20:06,567
Will you... will you help me?

166
00:20:08,733 --> 00:20:11,122
Aquí es el derecho.

167
00:20:17,853 --> 00:20:20,447
I hope to see you again.

168
00:20:21,173 --> 00:20:23,164
Adiós.

169
00:20:54,133 --> 00:20:56,966
Ven, gallito. Tranquilo.

170
00:20:57,053 --> 00:20:59,613
Te necesito para mi trabajo.

171
00:20:59,693 --> 00:21:01,684
Ven, gallito.

172
00:21:37,373 --> 00:21:43,005
Acepta la sangre de este gallo que te ofrezco

173
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:47,405
y ayúdame a deshacerme
de este hombre malo.

174
00:21:52,773 --> 00:21:56,288
Gallo, te mato por tu sangre.

175
00:22:29,773 --> 00:22:31,365
- Looks good.
- Mm-hm.

176
00:22:31,453 --> 00:22:34,286
Nice to be back. Your team looks great.

177
00:22:34,373 --> 00:22:39,811
Well, it looks good now. Last year
one of my best players OD'd on cocaine.

178
00:22:39,893 --> 00:22:44,250
I remember when the worst problem to worry
about was one of them knockin' up some girl.

179
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:47,131
- Not any more.
- I think I remember this place.

180
00:22:47,213 --> 00:22:50,922
Wasn't this the place
where all the ugly girls worked?

181
00:22:58,013 --> 00:23:02,370
- Hey, Nurse! Got an emergency here!
- Call a doctor!

182
00:23:02,453 --> 00:23:05,729
Listen, give me a beer,
and give my man here a double.

183
00:23:05,813 --> 00:23:10,125
- I don't do doubles on the first date.
- Now, that's not what I heard!

184
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:14,211
- This is my boy Hatch.
- Hi, Hatch.

185
00:23:19,933 --> 00:23:21,924
- ¿ Tiene miedo?
- No.

186
00:23:22,973 --> 00:23:24,964
Bien. Yo tampoco.

187
00:23:28,093 --> 00:23:30,288
- We're goin'in.
- OK.

188
00:23:46,573 --> 00:23:49,133
- Some hormones in here.
- Oh, yeah.

189
00:23:57,653 --> 00:24:02,602
Looks like one of the locals is doin'
some dealing. Supplementin' his income.

190
00:24:02,693 --> 00:24:07,448
- Leave it alone, man. Leave it alone.
- He's buyin' dope from the Jamaicans

191
00:24:07,533 --> 00:24:11,128
- and sellin' it to his friends.
- I've been all over the world with this.

192
00:24:11,213 --> 00:24:15,570
- It ain'tjust the Jamaicans. It's everybody.
- That's the same guy I saw by the school.

193
00:24:15,653 --> 00:24:19,612
And every time I see somethin' goin' down,
I see him. There he is.

194
00:24:30,973 --> 00:24:34,170
Last month, my 13-year-old nephew died

195
00:24:34,253 --> 00:24:37,848
in a crack house run by these guys.
That cut it for me.

196
00:24:37,933 --> 00:24:40,128
- I'm sorry.
- Look, I've had it!

197
00:24:41,173 --> 00:24:43,971
And now it seems
they're movin' in down here.

198
00:24:44,053 --> 00:24:47,409
- I'm just waitin' to do somethin'.
- Let me tell you somethin'.

199
00:24:47,493 --> 00:24:52,009
There's nothin' you can do about it
and there never was, all right?

200
00:24:52,613 --> 00:24:57,403
But you gotta try to protect your own, or
are you so burnt out you can't relate to that?

201
00:24:57,493 --> 00:24:59,324
No. I can relate to that.

202
00:25:10,333 --> 00:25:11,402
Excuse me.

203
00:25:27,493 --> 00:25:29,609
Blood and fire!

204
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:41,926
Go!

205
00:25:47,893 --> 00:25:49,531
Move out! Move out!

206
00:25:50,453 --> 00:25:53,525
Come on! Call an ambulance!

207
00:26:00,693 --> 00:26:04,368
Hey, bwoy! Somebody about dead tonight!

208
00:26:04,453 --> 00:26:06,330
Raas, what do you...?

209
00:26:06,413 --> 00:26:10,725
Me no know you, but I promise you
you is a dead man walkin'!

210
00:26:10,813 --> 00:26:12,769
So what else is new?

211
00:26:26,733 --> 00:26:29,452
Give us some room here! Come on, let's go.

212
00:26:32,213 --> 00:26:34,966
Let's clear the area. Clear that area.

213
00:26:41,773 --> 00:26:45,482
You're dead, bwoy! Yuh hear? Dead!

214
00:26:46,453 --> 00:26:49,172
- Welcome home.
- Is that the suspect, Mr Hatcher?

215
00:26:49,253 --> 00:26:51,608
Yeah, the first guy up there.

216
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:55,288
All right. Watch it, people.
Stay back behind the line.

217
00:26:55,613 --> 00:26:58,127
Like Los Angeles,
New York, and Washington,

218
00:26:58,213 --> 00:27:01,250
small-town America
now has blood in its streets,

219
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:05,451
as a gang shoot-out in Lincoln Heights
tonight has left four dead.

220
00:27:05,533 --> 00:27:09,208
Although less than one per cent
of Jamaican immigrants are involved,

221
00:27:09,293 --> 00:27:13,889
Jamaican gangs, known as posses, are
now dominating the American drug trade,

222
00:27:13,973 --> 00:27:17,966
with more than 10,000 members
trafficking drugs in 20 states.

223
00:27:18,213 --> 00:27:23,287
According to Justice Department officials,
they are as disciplined as they are violent.

224
00:27:23,373 --> 00:27:25,841
Torture and maiming are posse trademarks,

225
00:27:25,933 --> 00:27:29,972
and posse gunmen are said to prefer
shooting their victims in public.

226
00:27:30,053 --> 00:27:34,922
Sources estimate they have committed
1400 murders in three and a half years.

227
00:27:35,413 --> 00:27:38,530
Dale Harimoto, WXTV, Chicago.

228
00:27:38,613 --> 00:27:41,081
- Stay back. Watch it.
- Sheriff O'Dwyer.

229
00:27:43,693 --> 00:27:48,244
- I'm Sheriff O'Dwyer. Who might you be?
- Roselli. FBI, OC task force.

230
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,722
- We're taking over here.
- By what authority?

231
00:27:50,813 --> 00:27:53,885
United States Government Code,
Title 18, Section 111.

232
00:27:53,973 --> 00:27:58,205
Go get their statements.
Keep the looky-loos out of the crime scene.

233
00:27:58,293 --> 00:28:01,490
- You're excused, Sheriff.
- Roselli, I won't forget this.

234
00:28:01,573 --> 00:28:07,045
You and your agents so much as spit on
the deck, and I'll personally write the citation.

235
00:28:08,093 --> 00:28:12,450
Hatcher! Jesus Christ!
What the hell are you doin' back here?

236
00:28:12,533 --> 00:28:16,731
Thought I'd visit my mother, you know?
I'm retired now.

237
00:28:16,813 --> 00:28:19,930
Retired, huh? Well, that's cosy.
What the hell went down?

238
00:28:20,013 --> 00:28:23,801
Gee, I don't know. What does it look like?
It's a shoot-out... Colombians...

239
00:28:23,893 --> 00:28:26,805
- What do you want me to say?
- Probably Tito Barco's clan.

240
00:28:26,893 --> 00:28:32,490
- What would Tito Barco be doing up this far?
- Losing. The turf is spreading out, Hatcher.

241
00:28:32,573 --> 00:28:37,089
The Jamaican posse's more organised than
the others. They got more guns, more balls.

242
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:39,482
Jimmy Fingers is giving them everything.

243
00:28:39,573 --> 00:28:42,929
Jimmy Fingers...
ex-casino man out of Atlantic City.

244
00:28:43,013 --> 00:28:45,891
That's a piece of cake.
You pop him, you got it.

245
00:28:45,973 --> 00:28:49,124
- Why don't you help us out on this one?
- Cos I'm out.

246
00:28:49,213 --> 00:28:53,809
- Come on, Hatcher. It's in the blood.
- If it's in the blood, I'll get a transfusion.

247
00:28:53,893 --> 00:28:58,683
Lieutenant, may I see yuh for a moment? The
professor has found something interesting.

248
00:28:58,773 --> 00:29:02,448
- Charles, how ya doin'?
- We'll see you around, Hatcher.

249
00:29:02,533 --> 00:29:05,923
- The sign on de wall is Abakua.
- More of this voodoo bullshit?

250
00:29:06,013 --> 00:29:09,130
Professor, you call the markings
on de wall voodoo bullshit?

251
00:29:09,213 --> 00:29:12,842
Nope. I've seen them in New York,
Los Angeles and now here.

252
00:29:12,933 --> 00:29:18,326
Sal, dis is no bullshit, man. Those markings
were put dere by a man named Screwface.

253
00:29:18,413 --> 00:29:21,052
Know what it means
when we say a man's face is screwed?

254
00:29:21,133 --> 00:29:24,921
- No.
- Well, I pray you never have to find that out.

255
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:27,163
Who's that?

256
00:29:27,893 --> 00:29:31,886
It's John Hatcher. He was an undercover
troubleshooter for the DEA.

257
00:29:31,973 --> 00:29:36,046
- We worked together a couple of years ago.
- I know him. Him comin' in wid us?

258
00:29:36,133 --> 00:29:38,249
No. He thinks he's retired.

259
00:29:38,293 --> 00:29:41,012
He still looks functional to me.

260
00:30:04,693 --> 00:30:07,491
I have a message for you

261
00:30:08,053 --> 00:30:10,009
from Tito!

262
00:30:10,293 --> 00:30:13,683
Him say meet him in hell!

263
00:30:28,013 --> 00:30:32,882
# I work day and night to find my daily needs

264
00:30:34,293 --> 00:30:38,571
# Freedom is suppressed
by another one's greed

265
00:30:40,533 --> 00:30:45,129
# Why should certain ones
control another one's needs?

266
00:30:46,813 --> 00:30:51,489
# It's rebellion these kind of actions breed

267
00:30:51,573 --> 00:30:54,007
# I can't get no justice

268
00:30:55,133 --> 00:30:57,124
# Under this system

269
00:30:57,773 --> 00:31:00,162
# I can't get no justice...

270
00:31:01,413 --> 00:31:03,722
- Dem let you out?
- No jail can hold me

271
00:31:03,813 --> 00:31:06,691
- when Jimmy Fingers is on my side.
- Same.

272
00:31:07,373 --> 00:31:09,364
Jimmy Fingers.

273
00:31:09,453 --> 00:31:13,241
Give t'anks for
bringin' out my bredren. Same?

274
00:31:13,333 --> 00:31:17,770
Bondsman knew he was gonna skip,
so I figured I'd throw him a little extra.

275
00:31:17,853 --> 00:31:21,243
- Monkey, time for business.
- Let's take care o' dis.

276
00:31:21,333 --> 00:31:23,324
Come.

277
00:31:24,453 --> 00:31:28,526
# Why should one be judged
by the colour of their skin?

278
00:31:30,653 --> 00:31:32,291
# Instead of the quality...

279
00:31:44,213 --> 00:31:47,728
No, man. I just think
you have to take it one step at a time.

280
00:31:52,653 --> 00:31:56,726
Nobody. Yuh know what I'm sayin'?
Me notjokin', bwoy.

281
00:31:56,813 --> 00:31:59,247
Yes, man. Yes. Hold on. Hold on.

282
00:31:59,333 --> 00:32:03,485
Listen up, you see?
Our provider, the man of science, a come!

283
00:32:03,573 --> 00:32:05,370
All right!

284
00:32:05,453 --> 00:32:08,570
Dreadlocks, Monkey be wid us again.
Dat no good?

285
00:32:08,653 --> 00:32:09,529
Yeah!

286
00:32:09,613 --> 00:32:12,002
And the magic be everywhere.

287
00:32:13,053 --> 00:32:16,409
The warriors... Conquerors!

288
00:32:16,493 --> 00:32:20,805
Respec'. The Almighty
has given I an' I his hand.

289
00:32:20,893 --> 00:32:23,043
His rod of correction I hold.

290
00:32:26,093 --> 00:32:29,483
Let no man here fear for his own life!

291
00:32:29,853 --> 00:32:34,449
Dem dat wish I an' I
to be left in poverty and squalor

292
00:32:34,533 --> 00:32:36,728
will demselves be damned!

293
00:32:40,493 --> 00:32:43,087
If a man commit a crime against you,

294
00:32:44,813 --> 00:32:49,045
he must be paid back a t'ousand times!

295
00:32:52,293 --> 00:32:54,284
Who you fear?

296
00:32:55,213 --> 00:32:58,842
Him... or me?

297
00:33:06,133 --> 00:33:11,366
Let no man here steer
from de path I 'ave prepared!

298
00:33:16,613 --> 00:33:19,889
Dem de streets out dere
belong to you now!

299
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:26,162
- Take it.
- Yeah!

300
00:33:26,653 --> 00:33:28,052
Take it!

301
00:33:28,653 --> 00:33:30,644
Take it!

302
00:33:31,413 --> 00:33:33,404
- Come.
- Yes.

303
00:33:38,693 --> 00:33:43,164
I still don't believe you. If you don't see
the shit that's happening around us,

304
00:33:43,253 --> 00:33:46,450
- you're blind or you don't wanna see.
- Maybe I've seen enough.

305
00:33:46,533 --> 00:33:50,890
- I don't think the world wants to change.
- Look, things do change, man.

306
00:33:50,973 --> 00:33:55,489
It's like you see this big dam with a leak
in it. You plug it with your finger.

307
00:33:55,573 --> 00:34:00,408
Soon you see more holes. You plug it with
your other fingers, your toes, your tongue.

308
00:34:00,493 --> 00:34:03,451
But the water keeps on gushing out.
That's the way it is.

309
00:34:03,533 --> 00:34:05,728
Pretty soon, you quit or get killed.

310
00:34:05,813 --> 00:34:09,442
Five days later, they got
some shitbird cherry to take your place,

311
00:34:09,533 --> 00:34:12,127
they give him your shield,
and you're forgotten.

312
00:34:12,213 --> 00:34:16,286
The way I look at it, you come home, mind
your own business, watch your own yard.

313
00:34:16,373 --> 00:34:20,332
And then, if trouble finds you,
you go after it and you bite its head off

314
00:34:20,413 --> 00:34:22,927
before it does the same thing to you.

315
00:34:23,013 --> 00:34:26,801
Look, Hatch,
you haven't been here in a long time,

316
00:34:26,893 --> 00:34:31,330
and I'm telling you, trouble is tapping us
both on the shoulder right now,

317
00:34:31,413 --> 00:34:35,850
- and you don't want to turn around.
- Well, I hope you're wrong.

318
00:34:38,653 --> 00:34:42,613
- You look a little winded there, big guy.
- Gimme a break. I'm on vacation.

319
00:34:42,613 --> 00:34:44,490
Tracey has something to show you.
She's been waiting.

320
00:35:08,613 --> 00:35:09,932
Get down!

321
00:35:25,053 --> 00:35:27,044
Johnny!

322
00:35:28,613 --> 00:35:31,650
They hurt my baby!

323
00:35:47,373 --> 00:35:51,286
Tracey is in serious condition,
and she's unstable.

324
00:35:51,373 --> 00:35:55,048
There's pressure on the brain
that we'll have to relieve.

325
00:35:55,133 --> 00:35:59,411
- Well, what does that mean?
- Surgery. I can't give you a prognosis.

326
00:35:59,493 --> 00:36:02,690
She's fighting for her life, and so are we.

327
00:36:07,853 --> 00:36:11,607
Doc, you treat this girl like she's
the president of the United States.

328
00:36:11,693 --> 00:36:15,527
- Money isn't a consideration.
- We treat all of our patients exactly...

329
00:36:15,613 --> 00:36:20,209
Let me tell you somethin'.
Like the president of the United States, OK?

330
00:36:24,293 --> 00:36:27,171
Don't touch me, John. Don't touch me.

331
00:36:27,253 --> 00:36:31,371
This is your fault.
Do you understand? This is your fault.

332
00:36:31,453 --> 00:36:34,604
God damn you! God damn you!

333
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:38,049
This is your fault! And my baby...

334
00:36:38,133 --> 00:36:40,124
My baby...

335
00:37:55,253 --> 00:37:58,484
- Jimmy, how ya doin'?
- Hatch, what the fuck are you doin' here?

336
00:37:58,573 --> 00:38:02,930
Why don't you guys take a hike?
Go find another trick, all right?

337
00:38:04,453 --> 00:38:08,446
You bailed out a Jamaican, street name
Monkey, the other day. I want him.

338
00:38:08,533 --> 00:38:11,650
This other piece of shit - Screwface -
I want him.

339
00:38:11,733 --> 00:38:14,327
You're a scumbag and a puke.
I don't mind that.

340
00:38:14,413 --> 00:38:17,689
Gimme what I need, I leave here a nice guy.
You don't, I fuck you up.

341
00:38:17,773 --> 00:38:20,412
You fuckin' know better than that, Hatcher.

342
00:38:23,053 --> 00:38:26,841
Come here. I just wanna talk to you
for a minute. Come here.

343
00:38:28,053 --> 00:38:31,762
The Mob throws you out of Atlantic City.
Now you sell guns to the Jamaicans.

344
00:38:31,853 --> 00:38:36,529
Fuckin' sell anything to anybody, except you.
Wouldn't sell you the sweat off my balls!

345
00:38:36,613 --> 00:38:38,331
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

346
00:38:41,213 --> 00:38:43,204
Watch it!

347
00:38:49,333 --> 00:38:51,767
- You're a fuckin' dead man, Hatcher!
- Yeah?

348
00:38:51,853 --> 00:38:55,163
I'm fuckin' Jimmy Fingers!
I'm a made fuckin' man!

349
00:38:59,973 --> 00:39:02,362
God made men.

350
00:39:06,013 --> 00:39:08,208
I wanna know where Screwface is.

351
00:39:08,653 --> 00:39:12,328
- Screwface? Me don't know no Screwface.
- Really?

352
00:39:12,413 --> 00:39:13,846
Hm. That's strange.

353
00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:18,411
- Does that remind you?
- Just shoot me now, man!

354
00:39:18,493 --> 00:39:21,087
I got a better idea. We're gonna go for a ride.

355
00:39:21,173 --> 00:39:26,930
Everybody's gonna see us, and Screwface
is gonna find out what good buddies we are.

356
00:39:27,773 --> 00:39:29,445
Come on.

357
00:39:32,213 --> 00:39:35,410
- Let's go! Let's go!
- All right, man! All right!

358
00:39:37,653 --> 00:39:40,406
Just easy. I will take you.

359
00:39:40,493 --> 00:39:43,166
Good. I wanna get there while I'm still young.

360
00:39:43,533 --> 00:39:46,172
Screwface kill me
a t'ousand deaths worse dan you.

361
00:39:46,253 --> 00:39:49,563
- Yeah?
- Find him your fuckin' self!

362
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,768
Well?

363
00:40:17,853 --> 00:40:21,687
One thought he was invincible.
The other thought he could fly.

364
00:40:21,773 --> 00:40:24,333
- So?
- They were both wrong.

365
00:40:34,373 --> 00:40:37,729
I wanna know the second
that call comes in, OK?

366
00:40:37,813 --> 00:40:38,882
So?

367
00:40:38,973 --> 00:40:43,649
Two dead. Dis one was shot in de forehead.
De other one was forced out de window.

368
00:40:43,733 --> 00:40:45,724
Did you find the hookers?

369
00:40:45,813 --> 00:40:48,771
Do you honestly believe
now is the time for findin' them?

370
00:40:48,853 --> 00:40:51,128
- This job was done by a pro.
- Is that right?

371
00:40:51,213 --> 00:40:55,570
That's right, and I'll bet my money
it was John Hatcher. Find me somethin'.

372
00:40:55,653 --> 00:40:59,646
- Sal, I will find you somethin'.
- He thinks he can do things his own way,

373
00:40:59,733 --> 00:41:02,850
but I'll tell you something - he can't.

374
00:41:03,773 --> 00:41:06,162
Stay close to home, Charles.

375
00:41:07,133 --> 00:41:09,522
Do it, man. Do it.

376
00:41:26,893 --> 00:41:29,282
Where Nesta?

377
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:38,526
Jimmy Fingers and Nesta are not too good.

378
00:41:38,613 --> 00:41:41,969
Nesta dead? Who do it?
De white boy Hatcher?

379
00:41:58,813 --> 00:42:01,532
I want... Hatcher dead!

380
00:42:03,093 --> 00:42:05,812
I want his family dead!

381
00:42:07,653 --> 00:42:10,486
And if you cannot kill him,

382
00:42:10,573 --> 00:42:13,292
I go kill him!

383
00:42:13,373 --> 00:42:15,762
And then I go kill you.

384
00:43:04,333 --> 00:43:08,167
- What about protection for my family?
- They're assigned.

385
00:43:08,253 --> 00:43:11,563
- Good.
- I should probably have them tailing you.

386
00:43:12,573 --> 00:43:15,804
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Where were you last night?

387
00:43:15,893 --> 00:43:17,884
With a friend.

388
00:43:18,613 --> 00:43:21,002
Stay retired.

389
00:43:45,773 --> 00:43:47,764
Hello?

390
00:43:51,173 --> 00:43:54,370
Hi. I'm John Hatcher.
I saw you the other night.

391
00:43:55,533 --> 00:43:58,809
- Yes. At the Shamrock.
- I kind of need some help.

392
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:01,692
Hold on. I'll be right down.

393
00:44:03,973 --> 00:44:06,089
It's an African black magic symbol.

394
00:44:06,173 --> 00:44:09,483
It was used by the Jamaican
drug gang the other night.

395
00:44:09,573 --> 00:44:14,044
- The FBI said I'd be getting photos today.
- I'm not with the FBI, you know.

396
00:44:15,853 --> 00:44:19,607
Well... the cow's tongue means
you've talked or exposed them,

397
00:44:19,693 --> 00:44:23,003
and have been marked for death.
Where did you get these?

398
00:44:23,133 --> 00:44:27,524
I got these...
at my family's house this morning.

399
00:44:29,853 --> 00:44:32,413
What about this black cross?

400
00:44:32,493 --> 00:44:36,691
This may seem ridiculous to you,
Hatcher, but these people are for real.

401
00:44:36,773 --> 00:44:39,162
Your family has been marked.

402
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:46,642
- Could I use your phone for a minute?
- Yeah, sure.

403
00:44:59,213 --> 00:45:01,602
- Hello?
- It's me. Is everything all right?

404
00:45:01,693 --> 00:45:05,686
Yeah, Johnny. I'm fine.
I just got back here from the hospital.

405
00:45:05,773 --> 00:45:09,083
Mom's there with Tracey.
She's better. She's stable.

406
00:45:09,173 --> 00:45:14,088
- I just had to come home and get some rest.
- Go look out the window. Is the guard there?

407
00:45:14,173 --> 00:45:16,562
Um, waitjust a minute.

408
00:45:22,053 --> 00:45:25,363
Yeah. The car's there,
but, uh, I don't see the guard.

409
00:45:27,533 --> 00:45:29,285
Johnny?

410
00:45:30,213 --> 00:45:31,123
Johnny!

411
00:45:33,453 --> 00:45:35,444
My God.

412
00:45:49,173 --> 00:45:51,562
Somebody help me!

413
00:45:54,213 --> 00:45:56,807
- What do you want?!
- I want you.

414
00:45:56,893 --> 00:46:01,045
What do you want? Just leave me alone.
Somebody's coming.

415
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:04,170
- You're making a big mistake.
- You're lying!

416
00:46:32,893 --> 00:46:36,044
Stop the blood claat cryin'.

417
00:46:36,133 --> 00:46:38,203
Everybody must dead!

418
00:46:38,293 --> 00:46:40,727
No! No, no...

419
00:46:42,333 --> 00:46:43,925
It's your turn.

420
00:46:54,413 --> 00:46:56,404
My father...

421
00:46:57,853 --> 00:47:01,084
I an' I go take you to a place, you see.

422
00:47:02,693 --> 00:47:05,082
Far, far away.

423
00:47:05,773 --> 00:47:08,367
You never been dere before.

424
00:47:11,693 --> 00:47:14,412
You a go dere now.

425
00:47:21,053 --> 00:47:23,248
It's not your body me want, no.

426
00:47:23,893 --> 00:47:26,282
It's your dreams.

427
00:47:34,333 --> 00:47:36,688
No, you bastard!

428
00:47:38,533 --> 00:47:40,524
I own you now.

429
00:47:41,133 --> 00:47:44,284
- No!
- Now I have power!

430
00:47:58,533 --> 00:48:02,208
Help me! Help me! Johnny, help me!

431
00:48:12,693 --> 00:48:16,686
He said... He said he'd be back.
He said he'd kill us both.

432
00:48:17,373 --> 00:48:21,127
Somehow, I don't think
he's gonna get the chance.

433
00:48:47,693 --> 00:48:50,412
I can't wait to nail this fucker.

434
00:48:50,493 --> 00:48:53,007
This is gonna be fun.

435
00:48:53,093 --> 00:48:55,084
Serious fun.

436
00:49:37,733 --> 00:49:40,566
Time to have fun.

437
00:49:57,173 --> 00:49:59,607
- What's happenin', brother?
- Irie, irie.

438
00:50:00,413 --> 00:50:02,563
- You want some blow?
- I want some blow.

439
00:50:02,653 --> 00:50:07,932
- Put your hands up or I'll blow your head off.
- Oh, cool, now. Keep a cool head, man.

440
00:50:08,013 --> 00:50:10,129
- See dem 'ere?
- Right there.

441
00:50:10,213 --> 00:50:11,612
Hatch!

442
00:51:18,773 --> 00:51:20,092
Watch out!

443
00:53:03,293 --> 00:53:07,127
- Take the right side! Take the right side!
- I got it! I got it!

444
00:53:11,573 --> 00:53:13,564
Shit!

Say, bwoy! I goin' kill

446
00:53:24,573 --> 00:53:26,643
You are a blood claat!

00:53:26,733 --> 00:53:28,928
Bumbo-claat!

Me say back off! You didn't hear me say?
You want her dead?

451
00:53:41,053 --> 00:53:44,648
Go ahead, kill her. I don't know her.
I don't care about her.

452
00:53:44,733 --> 00:53:47,566
I got you where I want you.
You like a dog wid no teeth.

453
00:53:47,653 --> 00:53:51,532
You wanna kill her, kill her.
I don't mind if you kill her. I don't know her.

454
00:53:53,493 --> 00:53:57,611
You a bad bwoy. Me a carve you now, bwoy.
Me a carve you! Me a carve you!

455
00:53:57,933 --> 00:54:00,367
Me a carve blood!

456
00:54:09,413 --> 00:54:11,404
Run, dread! Run!

457
00:54:19,933 --> 00:54:23,369
Raas, didn't you see it?
Blood claat, what run for?

458
00:54:23,453 --> 00:54:26,684
A one white boy and two bredda enough!

459
00:54:26,773 --> 00:54:31,449
Let's kick dis little blood claat.
Batty-hole, yuh see.

460
00:54:31,933 --> 00:54:34,606
- I ready a ready.
- Get him!

461
00:54:36,893 --> 00:54:38,884
Hold on. Hold on, now.

462
00:54:48,733 --> 00:54:51,122
Tear you, Rasta!

463
00:55:10,853 --> 00:55:13,321
You fuck with my family and you die.

464
00:55:22,013 --> 00:55:26,291
- Now we're talking serious fun, man.
- Abso-fucking-lutely.

465
00:55:37,093 --> 00:55:40,324
I've never met anyone quite like you, Hatcher.

466
00:55:40,693 --> 00:55:44,481
Go down to any soup kitchen,
you're gonna find a lot of guys just like me.

467
00:55:44,573 --> 00:55:48,088
- Why a soup kitchen?
- I'm just another unemployed guy.

468
00:55:48,173 --> 00:55:51,483
I don't think there is a lot of guys
like you anywhere.

469
00:55:51,573 --> 00:55:54,212
What's that supposed to mean?

470
00:55:54,293 --> 00:55:58,127
I've met a guy who is nice, not married,
gay, or trying to find himself,

471
00:55:58,213 --> 00:56:01,523
and he's trying very hard
to get himself killed.

472
00:56:01,613 --> 00:56:04,969
Well, I have some
unfinished business, you know,

473
00:56:05,053 --> 00:56:08,443
and I was hoping that you'd maybe
give me some of your advice.

474
00:56:09,213 --> 00:56:12,762
- What are you planning to do?
- I'm gonna take out the posse.

475
00:56:15,453 --> 00:56:17,364
Then destroy their system.

476
00:56:17,453 --> 00:56:21,287
When Screwface kills he wants
everyone to see he did it, or ordered it.

477
00:56:21,373 --> 00:56:24,365
That way he's both feared and worshipped.

478
00:56:25,493 --> 00:56:29,372
You'd have to kill him so the posse
thinks you've taken his power.

479
00:56:29,453 --> 00:56:32,047
That way they will believe
your magic is bigger.

480
00:56:32,093 --> 00:56:36,723
Otherwise they'll never stop
until you and your family are dead.

481
00:58:15,513 --> 00:58:17,788
I want you to meet my sister.

482
00:58:21,633 --> 00:58:23,908
Goddess of fire.

483
00:59:27,313 --> 00:59:31,431
This is what you ordered. Do you want
anything else? Wires? Surveillance?

484
00:59:31,513 --> 00:59:34,585
- No. Just firearms this time.
- OK. You got it.

485
00:59:34,673 --> 00:59:36,664
- For you.
- Thank you.

486
00:59:38,553 --> 00:59:42,910
- You still sober?
- Five years, man. One day at a time.

487
00:59:42,993 --> 00:59:44,904
Stay away from that dope.

488
00:59:53,873 --> 00:59:55,864
Hang on. Hang on.

489
01:00:08,353 --> 01:00:11,470
Max, meet Charles. Charles, meet Max.

490
01:00:17,113 --> 01:00:21,026
Man, I been after Screwface
for five long years, yuh see?

491
01:00:21,113 --> 01:00:25,152
I have followed him
from Kingston to here. All around.

492
01:00:25,233 --> 01:00:28,908
- You break my heart.
- Your tactic is makin' him tougher to snatch.

493
01:00:28,993 --> 01:00:31,382
Him jump already, yuh know?

494
01:00:34,073 --> 01:00:37,986
An' it's only I... who can guide you
to what it is yuh seek.

495
01:00:39,153 --> 01:00:41,747
I don't know if that'd be
a wise career move for you.

496
01:00:41,953 --> 01:00:46,265
Come on! Look close!
Who you think me work for? The DEA?

497
01:00:46,353 --> 01:00:49,425
I'm a Jamaican cop, man,
and Screwface is my career!

498
01:00:49,753 --> 01:00:55,111
Look, man. I don't really care who you work
for. You got your reasons and I got mine.

499
01:01:00,673 --> 01:01:03,506
Screwface has gone back to Jamaica.

500
01:01:08,833 --> 01:01:11,745
You know, Charles, sometimes

501
01:01:11,833 --> 01:01:13,983
three's not a crowd.

502
01:01:14,073 --> 01:01:16,712
The way I look at it, we need each other.

503
01:01:17,833 --> 01:01:19,471
Know what I mean?

504
01:01:27,793 --> 01:01:29,670
Let's do it, man.

505
01:02:22,913 --> 01:02:25,302
How ya doin'? Care package.

506
01:02:31,473 --> 01:02:33,862
Uncle Sam's contribution?

507
01:02:34,833 --> 01:02:36,983
Welfare for warfare, yuh know?

508
01:02:58,073 --> 01:03:00,633
This is my silent partner.

509
01:03:01,753 --> 01:03:04,825
A whisper in the ear
from this girl goes a long way.

510
01:03:19,793 --> 01:03:23,342
You didn't hear a thing.
You heard the slide click a little.

511
01:03:23,433 --> 01:03:25,793
Massive cool.

512
01:03:25,793 --> 01:03:27,784
Forward, Jamaica.

513
01:03:42,073 --> 01:03:46,351
# I work day and night to find my daily needs

514
01:03:47,753 --> 01:03:52,383
# Freedom is suppressed
by another one's greed

515
01:03:54,513 --> 01:03:59,143
# Why should certain ones
control another one's needs?

516
01:04:00,753 --> 01:04:05,429
# It's rebellion this kind of action breeds

517
01:04:05,513 --> 01:04:07,822
# I can't get no justice

518
01:04:08,913 --> 01:04:11,268
# Under this system

519
01:04:11,353 --> 01:04:14,425
# I can't get me no justice

520
01:04:14,513 --> 01:04:17,311
# In this society

521
01:04:20,353 --> 01:04:24,187
These are the streets dat breed
de Screwfaces o' de world.

522
01:04:24,273 --> 01:04:28,551
This is the first time I ever got the idea
it's not all sunshine and bikinis.

523
01:04:28,913 --> 01:04:33,623
I owe you an apology. Until today I thought
all Jamaicans were dope-dealing dreads.

524
01:04:33,713 --> 01:04:38,343
Don't feel you have to apologise for nothin'.
Man, these streets are hard out here.

525
01:04:38,433 --> 01:04:43,109
And some people make a bad choice,
dat's all. They say life is hard.

526
01:05:01,673 --> 01:05:04,233
# I can't get no justice

527
01:05:05,473 --> 01:05:07,464
# Under this system

528
01:05:08,113 --> 01:05:10,911
# I can't get no justice

529
01:05:10,993 --> 01:05:13,826
# In this society

530
01:05:14,113 --> 01:05:17,549
# I can't get me no justice

531
01:05:18,913 --> 01:05:20,710
# Under this system

532
01:05:26,273 --> 01:05:28,264
- What, man?
- Nothin'.

533
01:05:28,353 --> 01:05:32,949
What are you doin' all de way up here?
Not enough trouble in Kingston, beast-boy?

534
01:05:33,193 --> 01:05:36,230
Back with country, boy. You do your duty?

535
01:05:37,753 --> 01:05:39,744
Pay him.

536
01:05:44,313 --> 01:05:48,147
Dis gal... she hang
with Screwface more time.

537
01:05:48,233 --> 01:05:52,306
Dey always partying together.
I usually find her at de Cat Club.

538
01:05:52,553 --> 01:05:56,068
# If you been a wicked boy,
your time has come

539
01:05:56,153 --> 01:05:59,350
# You don't live right,
you will have no more fun

540
01:06:00,033 --> 01:06:03,389
# John Crow, we're goin'
nyam your supper soon, boy

541
01:06:03,473 --> 01:06:06,909
# John Crow, we're goin'
lead the children astray

542
01:06:06,993 --> 01:06:10,303
# John Crow, I don't need de retribution

543
01:06:10,393 --> 01:06:13,669
# Justice has finally find a way

544
01:06:15,513 --> 01:06:19,222
# Screwface, you know
that your time has come

545
01:06:19,313 --> 01:06:22,908
# You don't do right,
you're gonna dead tonight

546
01:06:22,993 --> 01:06:26,065
# So now I goin' take you
down the road to doom

547
01:06:26,153 --> 01:06:30,032
# And John Crow I goin'
nyam out your supper soon

548
01:06:30,113 --> 01:06:33,469
# John Crow, we're goin'
nyam your supper soon, boy

549
01:06:33,553 --> 01:06:36,989
# John Crow, I goin' lead the children astray

550
01:06:37,073 --> 01:06:40,383
# John Crow, I don't need de retribution

551
01:06:40,473 --> 01:06:44,386
# Justice has finally find a way

552
01:06:46,513 --> 01:06:49,744
# Are you worried it's just
a wolf in sheep's clothing?

553
01:06:49,833 --> 01:06:52,745
# Tryin' to lead the children astray

554
01:06:53,393 --> 01:06:56,590
# But don't you know our 'ope it brighten?

555
01:06:56,673 --> 01:07:00,302
# Take my hands, I will show you the way

556
01:07:00,393 --> 01:07:03,465
# John Crow, we're goin'
nyam your supper soon, boy

557
01:07:03,553 --> 01:07:06,989
# John Crow, we're goin'
lead the children astray

558
01:07:07,073 --> 01:07:10,383
# John Crow, we don't need de retribution

559
01:07:10,473 --> 01:07:14,751
# Justice has finally find a way

560
01:07:16,233 --> 01:07:18,428
Screwface?

561
01:07:20,153 --> 01:07:22,144
Road to doom.

562
01:07:22,953 --> 01:07:27,185
- Sounds like you know this guy pretty well.
- Yeah, I know him.

563
01:07:27,273 --> 01:07:29,309
I partied wid him.

564
01:07:29,393 --> 01:07:33,625
I don't care him sell the drugs, sir.
It's part o' doin' business.

565
01:07:33,713 --> 01:07:38,389
But my sister, she lost a shipment
and him cut her dead.

566
01:07:38,473 --> 01:07:43,183
And for dat, somehow,
someday, him a go dust off.

567
01:07:43,673 --> 01:07:48,747
Why don't you just tell me what I gotta know,
and I'll go do what I gotta do?

568
01:07:51,913 --> 01:07:55,906
Screwface have two head and four eyes,

569
01:07:55,993 --> 01:07:58,826
an' dat is de secret to his magic.

570
01:08:33,753 --> 01:08:36,551
Look 'pon dis madman.

571
01:08:38,073 --> 01:08:41,827
Him dead, and him don't even know it.

572
01:15:06,353 --> 01:15:08,583
Welcome to I island.

573
01:15:08,873 --> 01:15:11,262
Fuck you.

574
01:15:12,593 --> 01:15:15,232
You a woman? Me know what you is.

575
01:15:15,313 --> 01:15:17,986
You is a dog after a bone!

576
01:15:18,393 --> 01:15:21,191
An' yuh have no teeth.

577
01:15:44,913 --> 01:15:47,268
You was conceived in darkness.

578
01:15:48,833 --> 01:15:52,872
An' I goin' deliver you into de light.

579
01:16:04,673 --> 01:16:07,107
I got him! I got him!

580
01:16:11,513 --> 01:16:13,583
Get up!

581
01:16:50,833 --> 01:16:53,905
I know you. You love de killin'.

582
01:16:54,753 --> 01:16:57,506
But you is an empty shell inside.

583
01:17:19,753 --> 01:17:21,869
Fall out.

584
01:17:21,953 --> 01:17:24,023
Charles. Move out.

585
01:17:51,193 --> 01:17:55,869
So, bredds... tell me one more time.
Did you tell them exactly what I told you to?

586
01:17:55,953 --> 01:17:58,626
I told 'em exactly what you told me to tell 'em.

587
01:17:58,713 --> 01:18:02,831
- And what did they say?
- Exactly what you said they was goin' to say.

588
01:18:02,913 --> 01:18:07,350
- Is that right? And what was that?
- "Business is business, man."

589
01:18:07,433 --> 01:18:09,628
Ten dollars.

590
01:18:09,713 --> 01:18:13,592
- It ain't over yet.
- Does this guy ever pay you on time?

591
01:19:14,753 --> 01:19:17,062
So who's the boss-man?

592
01:19:17,153 --> 01:19:19,986
- I man.
- Thanks for taking this meeting, man.

593
01:19:20,073 --> 01:19:22,667
I got a message for you. Screwface is dead.

594
01:19:23,193 --> 01:19:25,627
You raasclat stupid.

595
01:19:26,313 --> 01:19:28,543
Hey! Anybody ever see this?

596

Screwface is dead!
Now, you get the fuck outta town or die!

597
01:19:35,033 --> 01:19:38,628
Yuh must want me and me bumbo-claat
posse shoot you down, bwoy.

598
01:19:45,393 --> 01:19:47,668
Dead and about to be buried!

599
01:19:49,273 --> 01:19:51,503
The evil is demolished.

600
01:19:53,993 --> 01:19:57,303
I give you guys till tomorrow... or you die.

601
01:20:03,633 --> 01:20:06,022
Don't even think about it.

602
01:20:16,393 --> 01:20:20,909
- Magic power!
- Screwface no dead. Screwface no dead.

603
01:20:21,753 --> 01:20:25,746
- Judas!
- The man is everywhere, man!

604
01:20:41,073 --> 01:20:42,426
- You all right?
- Yeah.

605
01:20:42,513 --> 01:20:44,822
Here. Just take this.
