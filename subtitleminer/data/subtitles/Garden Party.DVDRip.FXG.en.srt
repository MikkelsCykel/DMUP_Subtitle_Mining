00:00:34,984 --> 00:00:38,147
Hey. You need a ride?

2
00:00:39,489 --> 00:00:41,480
I'm Davey Diamond.

3
00:00:42,358 --> 00:00:44,053
You're sitting on my face.

4
00:00:45,095 --> 00:00:47,256
Turn around.
That's me. See?

5
00:00:47,397 --> 00:00:49,388
Good-looking guy, right?

6
00:00:49,566 --> 00:00:50,806
You need an apartment?

7
00:00:50,807 --> 00:00:53,400
I can help you with that.
I'll find you a gem.

8
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:57,034
That's my motto:
"I'll find you a gem."

9
00:00:57,173 --> 00:00:59,573
You get it?
Diamond. Gem.

10
00:00:59,876 --> 00:01:00,759
Give me a call.

11
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,642
You know you're gonna
need a friend in this town.

12
00:02:03,573 --> 00:02:06,007
Let's get a move on.

13
00:02:06,142 --> 00:02:08,133
I'll be in the truck.

14
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:20,913
I don't know if that's what you guys
were looking for, or whatever.

15
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:23,143
No, man. It was cool.
So, what's your story?

16
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:25,184
I'm just looking for a band, you know.

17
00:03:25,355 --> 00:03:27,619
No. I mean, where you from?
Where you living?

18
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,588
We're from everywhere, you know.
We moved around a lot.

19
00:03:30,727 --> 00:03:32,718
Oh, yeah.
I lived all over the Valley.

20
00:03:32,862 --> 00:03:35,057
I'm new in town,
so I'm still looking for a place.

21
00:03:35,198 --> 00:03:38,167
- Who are you staying with, man?
- I got some friends.

22
00:03:38,334 --> 00:03:40,529
Okay. So we gotta chat.

23
00:03:40,703 --> 00:03:42,796
But it was good.
We liked it.

24
00:03:43,206 --> 00:03:46,004
So I'll just call you guys
in a couple of days, then.

25
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:48,702
Yeah, you know what?
Let me grab your cell phone.

26
00:03:49,012 --> 00:03:51,276
I'm still working on getting a phone...

27
00:03:51,414 --> 00:03:53,405
...so I'll probably have to call you.

28
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:56,711
You know what?
Here. Grab our old fliers.

29
00:03:56,853 --> 00:03:58,844
Number. E-mail.
Call us tomorrow.

30
00:03:59,289 --> 00:04:01,280
All right, cool.

31
00:04:01,891 --> 00:04:03,984
Hey, you guys mind
if I have another slice?

32
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,420
Take the rest, man.
Grab a beer. It's cool.

33
00:04:11,634 --> 00:04:13,158
Okay.

34
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:17,636
I need you to make
copies of these listings,

35
00:04:17,637 --> 00:04:19,101
and bring them to The Standard.

36
00:04:19,242 --> 00:04:21,005
- Got it.
- Then...

37
00:04:22,045 --> 00:04:24,775
...make copies of these,
and bring them to the Simpsons.

38
00:04:24,914 --> 00:04:27,940
- They are so ready to buy.
- Awesome.

39
00:04:28,117 --> 00:04:29,584
Do that, and then call me.

40
00:04:29,752 --> 00:04:32,585
Is it cool if, after I do all this,
I just go home?

41
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:37,950
Just call me, in case.

42
00:04:38,261 --> 00:04:39,728
Yeah.

43
00:04:40,797 --> 00:04:43,357
- You're up for this, aren't you?
- Oh, of course.

44
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:45,933
So many people would love your job.
You have a free car...

45
00:04:46,069 --> 00:04:47,730
- I know.
...and a nice place to live.

46
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,134
But I need you 24/7.

47
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:16,887
Hey. How's it going?

48
00:05:17,367 --> 00:05:18,891
He's a fucking pig.

49
00:05:19,035 --> 00:05:21,162
Yeah, my stepdad's always trying
to do that kind of shit.

50
00:05:21,304 --> 00:05:25,502
- At least he didn't try to touch you.
- Yeah. That would be gross.

51
00:05:25,641 --> 00:05:28,194
How long you gonna
stay there, anyway?

52
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:29,634
Where's your mom again?

53
00:05:30,446 --> 00:05:34,109
- She's in Vegas.
- She still stripping?

54
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:38,543
I don't know. She says she's working
as a cocktail waitress.

55
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:44,654
- Why don't you just move to Vegas?
- She won't let me.

56
00:05:44,827 --> 00:05:47,660
Lock your doors at night.
That's what I do.

57
00:05:47,797 --> 00:05:51,392
I mean, I was, like, hoping that I could
get a job and save up some money.

58
00:05:51,534 --> 00:05:53,263
What kind of job?

59
00:05:53,803 --> 00:05:56,931
I don't know.
My cousin, she lives in Silver Lake.

60
00:05:57,073 --> 00:05:59,974
And her roommate, or something,
is moving out in a couple weeks.

61
00:06:00,143 --> 00:06:01,735
And the rent's like 450 a month.

62
00:06:01,878 --> 00:06:06,406
I know a job where you can make a
quick 450 bucks for a couple hours' work.

63
00:06:08,351 --> 00:06:10,148
Nice.

64
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:13,949
You need to feel like you want me.
Like you're hot for me.

65
00:06:17,026 --> 00:06:20,291
Nice. You want some more wine?

66
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,454
No, I'm fine.

67
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:25,957
Am I... Am I doing something wrong?

68
00:06:26,102 --> 00:06:27,831
You just need to relax a little bit.
Okay?

69
00:06:28,004 --> 00:06:29,670
You need to look at
me like you want me.

70
00:06:29,671 --> 00:06:30,564
Like you're hot for me.

71
00:06:30,706 --> 00:06:33,300
You know what it's like
to be hot for someone, right?

72
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:38,578
Okay, you wanna fuck me.
And I got a big dick.

73
00:06:38,714 --> 00:06:39,976
Yeah.

74
00:06:40,783 --> 00:06:42,774
You can see that, can't you?

75
00:06:43,853 --> 00:06:45,251
Yeah. You know what?

76
00:06:45,252 --> 00:06:48,187
Talk to me a little
bit about my big dick.

77
00:06:50,259 --> 00:06:52,989
What do you...?
What do you want me to say?

78
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:58,266
Tell me how much you wanna suck it,
how you wanna lick it.

79
00:06:58,401 --> 00:07:02,201
I wanna...
I wanna suck your big dick.

80
00:07:06,275 --> 00:07:08,266
<i>Are you watching?</i>

81
00:07:21,224 --> 00:07:24,216
Yeah. Hi, Anna.
Can you hold on a second?

82
00:07:30,433 --> 00:07:33,051
Yeah, well, I had to
run from the other side

83
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:35,029
of the studio to pick the phone up.

84
00:07:37,773 --> 00:07:39,764
Well, I'm painting.

85
00:07:40,576 --> 00:07:42,567
I don't know.

86
00:07:43,446 --> 00:07:45,243
I don't know.

87
00:07:46,983 --> 00:07:49,383
A few hours, maybe.

88
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:50,918
Yeah.

89
00:07:54,423 --> 00:07:57,119
<i>I'll just pick up some sushi</i>
<i>on the way home.</i>

90
00:08:00,196 --> 00:08:02,596
- Forget it.
- Thanks, Sally.

91
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,324
Anytime.

92
00:08:13,609 --> 00:08:15,600
Shit.

93
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:22,575
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

94
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,811
Do you know
how to get gum off a shoe?

95
00:08:24,954 --> 00:08:26,945
Yeah. I can do that.

96
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:50,646
If you get it right away,
it usually comes right off. There we go.

97
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:54,440
Just some realtor's card
I won't ever use, anyway.

98
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:56,613
Buyer or seller?

99
00:08:58,321 --> 00:09:02,155
Me? My mother left me her house.

100
00:09:02,325 --> 00:09:04,054
But my girlfriend hates it.

101
00:09:04,193 --> 00:09:06,184
You should have me check it out.

102
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:10,926
Ask anyone.
I'm the best in the neighborhood.

103
00:09:12,168 --> 00:09:14,159
Houses are like cars.

104
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:17,605
After a while,
you wanna trade it in.

105
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:20,300
I've lived in that house my whole life.

106
00:09:25,681 --> 00:09:28,013
Thanks for saving my shoe.

107
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:31,877
<i>I went to a garden party</i>

108
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:36,207
<i>To reminisce with my old friends</i>

109
00:10:37,286 --> 00:10:40,483
<i>A chance to share old memories</i>

110
00:10:40,623 --> 00:10:42,818
<i>Sing our songs again</i>

111
00:10:47,296 --> 00:10:50,026
Can I get a pack of rolling
papers too, please?

112
00:10:50,433 --> 00:10:53,425
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

113
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:55,093
$7.89.

114
00:11:00,776 --> 00:11:04,769
You got a few bucks I could borrow?
For some food?

115
00:11:05,448 --> 00:11:08,281
Sorry, man.
I don't have anything.

116
00:11:09,018 --> 00:11:12,749
- All right.
- Hey, where you headed?

117
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:18,991
I'm just, you know, hanging out.
I got some friends...

118
00:11:19,662 --> 00:11:23,655
- You need a ride?
- Yeah, that'd be great.

119
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:25,323
All right, cool. Hop in.

120
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:03,561
I like your jeans.

121
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:11,107
They just... They... They're cool.

122
00:12:17,853 --> 00:12:20,913
- You live here?
- Well, it's my boss' place.

123
00:12:21,056 --> 00:12:23,786
It's kinda part of the deal.
I get to live here...

124
00:12:23,926 --> 00:12:28,158
...as long as I'm on call 24 hours a day,
and I watch over the plants.

125
00:12:33,102 --> 00:12:35,798
So do you have a girlfriend?

126
00:12:38,574 --> 00:12:41,873
Sorry, that's kind of
a personal question.

127
00:12:45,414 --> 00:12:47,541
Whoa, man, this is crazy.

128
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:51,619
Yeah, and pretty elaborate.
It's all for Sally and her clients.

129
00:12:51,754 --> 00:12:54,621
Why do you think she's the
best realtor in the neighborhood?

130
00:12:54,757 --> 00:12:57,089
So okay.
You get all you want for free?

131
00:12:57,226 --> 00:12:59,694
Yeah. Sally warned me to be careful...

132
00:12:59,829 --> 00:13:01,854
...'cause the last guy that worked
for her ended up in rehab.

133
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:04,499
So I try to be cool
and only smoke at night.

134
00:13:05,501 --> 00:13:07,765
Plus, a couple nights a week
I go to the gym.

135
00:13:08,437 --> 00:13:10,701
So I don't smoke on those nights.

136
00:13:12,975 --> 00:13:16,103
- Do you work out?
- No, man.

137
00:13:16,245 --> 00:13:18,577
I'm a musician.

138
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:20,978
You can have some bud,
if you want any.

139
00:13:21,984 --> 00:13:25,112
- You serious?
- Yeah.

140
00:13:25,254 --> 00:13:27,245
It's pretty kind.

141
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:31,055
Holy shit.

142
00:13:31,193 --> 00:13:33,388
You can have that.
She won't notice.

143
00:13:50,813 --> 00:13:53,873
Wow. You're up early.

144
00:13:54,683 --> 00:13:57,015
Yeah, I guess.

145
00:13:57,152 --> 00:14:00,349
I heard the coyotes this morning.
I couldn't go back to sleep.

146
00:14:01,357 --> 00:14:04,520
- These albums are amazing.
- It's just a bunch of old shit.

147
00:14:05,027 --> 00:14:07,461
I think they were here
when Sally bought the house.

148
00:14:09,498 --> 00:14:12,797
I love them, though.
I listen to them a lot.

149
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:14,763
All the time.

150
00:14:15,971 --> 00:14:18,030
Oh, I'm making a pot of coffee.
Is that cool?

151
00:14:18,173 --> 00:14:20,505
Oh, yeah.
Help yourself.

152
00:14:21,644 --> 00:14:23,703
But I gotta get going.

153
00:14:23,846 --> 00:14:25,863
Sally expects me to be there early,

154
00:14:25,864 --> 00:14:28,340
and I have to pick up
coffee for everybody.

155
00:14:29,652 --> 00:14:31,779
So are you gonna stick around?

156
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:36,617
I mean... See ya tonight?

157
00:14:37,192 --> 00:14:38,853
- Yeah, definitely.
- Okay.

158
00:14:38,994 --> 00:14:42,259
- All right.
- See ya.

159
00:14:44,533 --> 00:14:46,933
Nathan. Get in here.

160
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,428
More packets to go out.

161
00:14:53,429 --> 00:14:56,339
And make sure you put
samples in everybody's packet.

162
00:14:56,512 --> 00:14:58,503
I thought I put them in every packet.

163
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:00,274
- Okay, okay. Shut up.
- Sorry.

164
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:03,010
By the way,
how are my samples doing?

165
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,211
I haven't been in there in a couple days.

166
00:15:07,756 --> 00:15:10,554
That is not our agreement.
You go in there tonight...

167
00:15:10,726 --> 00:15:12,717
...and make sure
my babies are doing okay.

168
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:16,831
- Are you stoned?
- No. Why would I...? Why would I be...?

169
00:15:16,966 --> 00:15:19,730
- I don't want you being stoned at work.
- I'm not stoned.

170
00:15:19,902 --> 00:15:24,168
All right, bye. Hurry up.
The phone is ringing.

171
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:28,040
Sally St. Clair's office.

172
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,510
- How you doing?
- Real good.

173
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:41,918
I'd like you to meet a friend of mine.

174
00:15:43,892 --> 00:15:45,883
She's...

175
00:15:47,396 --> 00:15:49,227
...kinda young.

176
00:15:49,398 --> 00:15:51,389
I thought that's how you liked them.

177
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:54,696
Look, just take care of her,
and we'll take care of you.

178
00:15:55,137 --> 00:15:58,265
- Both of you?
- You know it.

179
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:35,176
This is so frickin' sweet.
I'm diggin' it.

180
00:16:35,177 --> 00:16:36,703
Yeah, it's tight.
I've got some ideas.

181
00:16:36,845 --> 00:16:41,339
- We should blow the fuck up, fool!
- For sure.

182
00:17:04,073 --> 00:17:06,050
Hold up, hold up.
Dude, that was awesome.

183
00:17:06,051 --> 00:17:07,133
When did you write that?

184
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:11,735
This morning. I was thinking about
what you guys played yesterday.

185
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,594
I put on a pot of coffee,
and went at it.

186
00:17:13,595 --> 00:17:15,145
You wanna play a
show Friday night?

187
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,045
We're supposed to play this party.

188
00:17:17,046 --> 00:17:19,220
John was gonna sing,
but he fuckin' sucks.

189
00:17:19,354 --> 00:17:22,289
You're, like, killer.
Let's just have him sing, man.

190
00:17:22,424 --> 00:17:24,415
The parents are out of town.

191
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,688
It's gonna be a sweet party,
up in the hills. You should come.

192
00:17:27,863 --> 00:17:30,058
Yeah. Sounds good.

193
00:17:30,232 --> 00:17:32,223
Dirk, give him the address.

194
00:17:32,835 --> 00:17:34,826
Here. Take a flier.

195
00:17:36,171 --> 00:17:38,639
I'm gonna have to bum a ride.
Is it cool if I bring somebody?

196
00:17:38,774 --> 00:17:42,369
It's like 10 bucks for beer, but I'm sure
we can get your buddy in. Right?

197
00:17:42,544 --> 00:17:44,202
For sure. Get there around 5.

198
00:17:44,203 --> 00:17:46,776
We can set up, play.
We might play Hollywood.

199
00:17:46,915 --> 00:17:49,907
- You wanna do this again?
- Yeah, count it off.

200
00:18:02,564 --> 00:18:04,930
- <i>Studio.</i>
- Hello.

201
00:18:05,067 --> 00:18:07,058
- <i>Can I help you?</i>
- Yeah. Hi.

202
00:18:07,202 --> 00:18:09,329
I was wondering
if I could get my photo taken.

203
00:18:09,471 --> 00:18:11,268
<i>Did you see my site?</i>

204
00:18:11,406 --> 00:18:13,874
- No, a friend.
- <i>A friend?</i>

205
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:17,069
Yeah, she told me that a friend
of hers got her photo taken.

206
00:18:17,212 --> 00:18:19,419
<i>You know the kind
of pictures I take?</i>

207
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,204
Yeah, I know.

208
00:18:21,283 --> 00:18:25,344
<i>- Okay. And it's 450, right?</i>
<i>- It's 450 if you're good.</i>

209
00:18:25,487 --> 00:18:27,955
<i>Okay. So, what do I have to do?</i>

210
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:32,550
- <i>Studio.</i>
- Hi. I'm here to get my picture taken.

211
00:18:45,741 --> 00:18:48,232
- You're early.
- I took Metro.

212
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:50,709
Really? How was that?
I've never been on it.

213
00:18:50,846 --> 00:18:52,404
It's easy.

214
00:18:53,649 --> 00:18:56,641
Come in.
So your friends told you about us.

215
00:18:56,785 --> 00:18:59,583
What did they say?
Good things, I hope.

216
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:01,188
Stop.

217
00:19:03,792 --> 00:19:07,660
I wanna see you in that light.
Beautiful.

218
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:11,266
God, I can't wait to take
your picture. You're beautiful.

219
00:19:11,433 --> 00:19:14,425
People tell you you're beautiful
all the time, don't they?

220
00:19:15,771 --> 00:19:18,934
Okay. You know what?
Let's make this easy, all right?

221
00:19:19,608 --> 00:19:20,851
There's a robe in there.

222
00:19:20,852 --> 00:19:23,544
Take off your clothes,
put on the robe, come on out.

223
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,274
We'll just start
with some simple headshots, okay?

224
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,816
Come on, let me hear you say "okay".

225
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,242
Okay.

226
00:19:59,381 --> 00:20:02,043
- Sally St. Clair's office.
- Yeah, hi. Is Sally in?

227
00:20:02,217 --> 00:20:05,118
- Yeah, may I ask who's calling?
- This is Todd Winger.

228
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:08,188
- I'm sorry, one more time?
- Todd Winger.

229
00:20:08,357 --> 00:20:10,655
Todd Winger.
Okay, can you hold please? Thank you.

230
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:12,657
We got a live one.

231
00:20:14,696 --> 00:20:16,823
Name, please? Hello?

232
00:20:18,934 --> 00:20:21,198
Todd Wang...? Wanger?

233
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:23,361
Todd Winger.

234
00:20:25,874 --> 00:20:28,468
Hello, Todd.
So are you ready?

235
00:20:28,944 --> 00:20:32,903
Yeah. I'm the guy
who took the gum off your shoe.

236
00:20:33,348 --> 00:20:36,476
And you did a damn fine job of it.

237
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:41,088
<i>Mother left you a house.</i>
<i>When can I see it?</i>

238
00:20:43,892 --> 00:20:46,827
Tomorrow afternoon?
How would that work?

239
00:20:46,962 --> 00:20:49,396
How about 3:00?

240
00:20:49,965 --> 00:20:51,523
Yeah, that sounds good.

241
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:54,431
<i>You know I'm not really sure</i>
<i>that I wanna sell.</i>

242
00:20:54,569 --> 00:20:58,096
Yes, of course.
This is just an exploratory meeting.

243
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:04,236
Your girlfriend doesn't like
this place because...?

244
00:21:04,379 --> 00:21:06,108
She says it's too big.

245
00:21:07,449 --> 00:21:10,976
You could pretty much move anywhere
you want if you sold this house.

246
00:21:11,653 --> 00:21:16,181
- What did your mother do?
- Nothing. She married well.

247
00:21:16,925 --> 00:21:19,223
My dad was a lot older.

248
00:21:19,394 --> 00:21:21,472
He developed a lot of
property out in the Valley.

249
00:21:21,473 --> 00:21:22,386
He was pretty well off.

250
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:25,591
So I take it you don't need the money.

251
00:21:26,134 --> 00:21:28,034
No, not really.

252
00:21:28,804 --> 00:21:30,795
Well, you could always rent it out.

253
00:21:30,939 --> 00:21:33,134
Yeah, I just don't know
if I'm ready to move.

254
00:21:33,275 --> 00:21:36,108
I grew up in this house.

255
00:21:37,145 --> 00:21:39,739
So how did you get into real estate?

256
00:21:43,285 --> 00:21:44,877
I was...

257
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:48,254
...desperate for a job where
I didn't have to take my clothes off.

258
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:54,025
Some guy walked into the club where
I was working and offered me a job.

259
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,494
He figured I'd be an easy lay.

260
00:21:58,266 --> 00:22:00,257
So...

261
00:22:01,269 --> 00:22:04,705
...I stole all of his clients,
and here we are.

262
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:10,808
I've seen your picture before
on the Internet.

263
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,071
You were much younger.

264
00:22:16,018 --> 00:22:18,009
What pictures?

265
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:22,284
Show me.

266
00:22:37,672 --> 00:22:39,765
How did you find these photos?

267
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:42,341
They've been on there forever.

268
00:22:43,311 --> 00:22:45,108
Is it your head
on someone else's body?

269
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:48,040
Nope.

270
00:22:49,885 --> 00:22:51,876
It's me.

271
00:22:52,888 --> 00:22:55,982
A few years ago, but it's still me.

272
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:57,955
You look good.

273
00:22:58,293 --> 00:23:00,284
I still do.

274
00:23:02,364 --> 00:23:04,628
So who owns the pictures?

275
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:09,293
A real low-life.

276
00:23:11,373 --> 00:23:14,137
I guess you could call him
my first boyfriend.

277
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:16,815
I sold 15 million dollars
worth of real estate

278
00:23:16,816 --> 00:23:18,575
for that son-of-a
bitch last year.

279
00:23:18,713 --> 00:23:21,307
He is not gonna cut
my commission now.

280
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:24,715
No. No. I want my full commission.
I don't give a shit.

281
00:23:24,853 --> 00:23:27,481
I do not give one shit.

282
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:29,647
- David?
- He doesn't have the money? Fuck him.

283
00:23:29,791 --> 00:23:32,157
I'll fight him
all the way to the courthouse.

284
00:23:32,594 --> 00:23:34,585
I gotta go. I gotta go.

285
00:23:34,796 --> 00:23:38,197
- Hi, I'm Leni.
- Leni, I'm David.

286
00:23:39,734 --> 00:23:41,463
Come here.

287
00:23:42,804 --> 00:23:46,467
Wow. Wow, you're a knockout.

288
00:23:46,608 --> 00:23:50,135
- Your picture doesn't do you justice.
- Thank you.

289
00:23:50,278 --> 00:23:52,269
So you hungry?

290
00:23:52,414 --> 00:23:54,405
- Sure.
- Come on.

291
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:06,751
Excellent.

292
00:24:11,566 --> 00:24:14,433
- I hope you like Indian food.
- I do.

293
00:24:14,569 --> 00:24:16,833
I like spicy food.

294
00:24:22,444 --> 00:24:23,968
Thank you.

295
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:29,380
So here's to new
and exciting opportunities.

296
00:24:40,929 --> 00:24:43,921
You looked a lot
different in your picture.

297
00:24:45,667 --> 00:24:47,965
That picture was taken a year ago.

298
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:54,300
And you're 40?

299
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:57,101
You're starting to insult me now, Leni.

300
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:00,737
No, no, no. It's just that I'm still new
to the online dating...

301
00:25:00,882 --> 00:25:02,975
...and I get confused.

302
00:25:03,151 --> 00:25:06,746
Then let me tell you something:
There's nothing to be confused about.

303
00:25:06,888 --> 00:25:10,949
Hey, you're a beautiful woman.
I'm a very successful guy.

304
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:12,136
And afterwards,

305
00:25:12,137 --> 00:25:15,090
I'll take you back to my estate
and I'll show you around.

306
00:25:18,033 --> 00:25:20,024
You confused still?

307
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:25,763
Have a drink.

308
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:29,175
- Come on.
- No, no. I wait for my car.

309
00:25:29,311 --> 00:25:32,906
No, no. We'll come back for your car.
It'll be better that way.

310
00:25:33,048 --> 00:25:34,709
- I wait for my car!
- Come on!

311
00:25:34,849 --> 00:25:36,840
I wait for my car.

312
00:25:36,985 --> 00:25:39,112
Oh, yeah? Okay, I get it.

313
00:25:39,254 --> 00:25:42,781
I mean, you let a guy take you out
for an expensive meal, right?

314
00:25:42,924 --> 00:25:45,154
And that's it?
I hope you enjoyed it.

315
00:25:45,327 --> 00:25:47,522
Here. Come on.
Go get her car.

316
00:25:47,662 --> 00:25:50,790
Piece of shit.
What is it? A fuckin' Yugo?

317
00:25:53,068 --> 00:25:55,059
So I'm not good enough for you?
Is that it?

318
00:25:55,203 --> 00:25:57,467
You want somebody younger?

319
00:25:57,606 --> 00:25:59,904
You want somebody better-looking?

320
00:26:00,075 --> 00:26:01,633
Yes.

321
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:02,793
What are you looking at?

322
00:26:02,794 --> 00:26:04,677
You know how much money
I spend in this place?

323
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:07,873
- Yeah. Not enough, though.
- Leni, huh?

324
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:11,009
Leni. I bet that's
not even your real name.

325
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:13,313
Go on back to the strip club, Leni!

326
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:36,276
Hello?

327
00:26:56,131 --> 00:26:58,258
It's nice, huh?

328
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,867
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

329
00:27:00,001 --> 00:27:03,869
You know, my mom always promised
she was gonna put in a pool.

330
00:27:04,005 --> 00:27:06,064
And then she never did it.

331
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:08,330
Come on. Playtime's over.
Let's get out. 

332
00:27:08,331 --> 00:27:08,937
All right.

333
00:27:09,077 --> 00:27:11,068
I'll show you the house.

334
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:18,413
- Wow, pretty swank.
- Yeah.

335
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:20,817
The guy's dad is, like, a software dude.

336
00:27:20,955 --> 00:27:23,219
Makes a lot of cash, I guess.

337
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,885
No, I'm cool.

338
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:31,565
You wanna call me?
I mean, I'll pick you up.

339
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:35,292
Don't worry about it.
I'll find a ride home.

340
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,840
- Hey, Sammy.
- Yeah?

341
00:27:42,644 --> 00:27:44,134
Nothing.

342
00:27:44,312 --> 00:27:46,303
They're all out here.

343
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:51,575
It's a cool house, huh?

344
00:27:53,455 --> 00:27:55,446
There's the band.

345
00:28:03,398 --> 00:28:06,663
Sammy, you made it.
Very cool.

346
00:28:06,801 --> 00:28:10,328
- What's up, man? You want a beer?
- No, not right now.

347
00:28:10,739 --> 00:28:12,730
I see you met Becky.

348
00:28:13,875 --> 00:28:16,901
- These are the rest of our groupies.
- Shut up, Wayne.

349
00:28:17,045 --> 00:28:19,036
All right, man.
You wanna go set up, or what?

350
00:28:23,218 --> 00:28:25,209
Five-letter word for "enlightenment"?

351
00:28:25,353 --> 00:28:27,617
You're asking the wrong guy, pal.

352
00:28:29,023 --> 00:28:31,617
Not tonight, please.

353
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,228
I'll do it first thing in the morning.
I promise, yeah.

354
00:28:34,362 --> 00:28:36,455
Oh, right now?

355
00:28:36,831 --> 00:28:40,631
Yeah, I'm out pulling the signs
out of the yards of your competitors.

356
00:28:41,369 --> 00:28:44,634
Yeah, okay. 8 a.m.
Absolutely. Bye.

357
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:49,967
Hey, I'll have a beer.
You know, whatever's cheapest.

358
00:28:56,518 --> 00:28:58,349
Your phone is ringing.

359
00:28:59,921 --> 00:29:01,320
Thanks.

360
00:29:06,928 --> 00:29:08,828
Five-letter word for "enlightenment"?

361
00:29:09,464 --> 00:29:12,262
I never was any good at that stuff.

362
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,597
"African nut-bearing tree"?
Four letters.

363
00:29:15,737 --> 00:29:19,537
- Life is my fucking puzzle.
- Okay. What do you do for fun?

364
00:29:22,877 --> 00:29:27,007
Honestly? Nothing.
Yeah, my life is a joyless existence.

365
00:29:27,148 --> 00:29:30,345
I work, I sleep, I do a bit of pot,
and I drink. That's it.

366
00:29:30,485 --> 00:29:32,919
I'm basically totally alone,
and lonely all the time.

367
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,046
Aren't you glad you asked?

368
00:29:34,222 --> 00:29:36,690
Yeah. I am.

369
00:29:39,494 --> 00:29:43,225
- What do you do for a living?
- I work for a real estate agent.

370
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:45,355
How's that going?

371
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:48,364
Does "joyless existence" ring a bell?

372
00:29:49,437 --> 00:29:51,769
Hey, let me buy you a shot.

373
00:29:51,906 --> 00:29:54,739
And let's get you a real beer.

374
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,527
April.

375
00:30:14,529 --> 00:30:16,861
Hey. How are you?

376
00:30:16,998 --> 00:30:19,057
I'm okay.

377
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,998
What...? What kind of bar is this?

378
00:30:23,805 --> 00:30:27,502
It's... It's a lesbian bar.

379
00:30:28,943 --> 00:30:30,934
So I got my money.

380
00:30:32,013 --> 00:30:35,210
- What money?
- The money for my month's rent.

381
00:30:35,817 --> 00:30:37,512
What rent?

382
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:41,420
Rent for your apartment...

383
00:30:41,556 --> 00:30:44,684
...'cause you said
that your roommate was moving out.

384
00:30:44,826 --> 00:30:46,817
I am her roommate.

385
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:50,860
Your cousin can be a
little bitch sometimes.

386
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:55,092
Listen, I can't go back home.

387
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:56,832
Why?

388
00:30:58,506 --> 00:31:00,235
Long story, but...

389
00:31:00,375 --> 00:31:03,833
...can I just stay with you guys
for a couple nights, or something?

390
00:31:03,978 --> 00:31:07,436
Yeah, sweetie.
Take a walk on the wild side.

391
00:31:08,516 --> 00:31:11,041
<i>I went to a garden party</i>

392
00:31:11,185 --> 00:31:14,450
<i>To reminisce with my old friends</i>

393
00:31:15,056 --> 00:31:18,514
<i>A chance to share old memories</i>

394
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,855
<i>And play our songs again</i>

395
00:31:21,396 --> 00:31:25,059
<i>When I got to the garden party</i>

396
00:31:25,233 --> 00:31:28,134
<i>They all knew my name</i>

397
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:31,864
<i>But no one recognized me</i>

398
00:31:32,006 --> 00:31:34,236
<i>I didn't look the same</i>

399
00:31:34,342 --> 00:31:39,541
<i>But it's all right now</i>
<i>I learned my lesson well</i>

400
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:41,672
Hey...

401
00:31:41,849 --> 00:31:44,545
<i>You see, you can't please everyone</i>

402
00:31:44,686 --> 00:31:47,917
<i>So you gotta please yourself</i>

403
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:51,686
<i>People came from miles around</i>

404
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:54,727
<i>Everyone was there</i>

405
00:31:54,862 --> 00:31:59,060
<i>Well, he was playing guitar</i>
<i>Just like ringing a bell</i>

406
00:31:59,233 --> 00:32:00,996
<i>And lookin' like he should</i>

407
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:05,162
<i>Well, if you gotta
play garden parties</i>

408
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,467
<i>I wish you a lot of luck</i>

409
00:32:08,109 --> 00:32:11,977
<i>But if memories were all I sang</i>

410
00:32:12,113 --> 00:32:14,274
<i>I'd rather drive a truck</i>

411
00:32:14,382 --> 00:32:16,612
<i>But it's all right now...</i>

412
00:32:16,784 --> 00:32:18,843
One: I'm not afraid to love.

413
00:32:18,987 --> 00:32:22,855
Two: I'm not afraid to be loved.
I know that sounds weird...

414
00:32:22,991 --> 00:32:26,188
...but I'm ready to make something
happen with the three of us together.

415
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:29,656
Do you hear that?

416
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:50,039
Hey.

417
00:32:51,953 --> 00:32:53,284
Hey.

418
00:32:54,622 --> 00:32:56,886
I really liked your songs.
They were amazing.

419
00:32:57,291 --> 00:32:59,555
That's cool. Thanks.

420
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:01,718
No, I mean it.

421
00:33:02,363 --> 00:33:05,764
So do you go to school
with Wayne and the guys?

422
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,562
I don't really go to school.

423
00:33:09,837 --> 00:33:13,568
- You live around here?
- I'm staying with a friend.

424
00:33:13,975 --> 00:33:16,284
I didn't go to the Tony Awards
with Lance Bass.

425
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:17,968
I don't bat left-handed.
I gotta go.

426
00:33:18,112 --> 00:33:20,239
How are you? I'm Joey Zane.
Nice to meet you.

427
00:33:20,715 --> 00:33:23,342
Put 'er there, big guy.
That's an Army handshake.

428
00:33:23,343 --> 00:33:24,708
That's a lot of confidence.

429
00:33:24,852 --> 00:33:27,412
I gotta tell you: I love you, kid.
I think you're very talented.

430
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:29,920
You're one of the best.
You can go straight to the top.

431
00:33:30,058 --> 00:33:32,482
I'm managing a band.
We're looking for a lead singer.

432
00:33:32,483 --> 00:33:33,425
We got great material.

433
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:36,188
I think you should come on down
and meet some of the guys.

434
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:39,925
What's this? Uh-oh. Shabba!
Yeah. It's my business card.

435
00:33:40,068 --> 00:33:41,831
With you on board,
this could be huge.

436
00:33:42,003 --> 00:33:44,597
I know this because of my dad,
Chucky Lane.

437
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:47,434
The Chucky Lane.
Come on, guy.

438
00:33:47,809 --> 00:33:50,539
He found Kurt Cobain working
at a fucking Abercrombie and Fitch.

439
00:33:50,678 --> 00:33:52,669
Where do you think
The Finals came from?

440
00:33:52,814 --> 00:33:55,078
He found the Ohio Players in Michigan.

441
00:33:55,216 --> 00:33:57,844
Look, I've been doing this
since I was in 8th grade.

442
00:33:58,019 --> 00:34:00,852
I've already signed a dozen bands
to major labels. You could be next.

443
00:34:01,022 --> 00:34:03,490
I just said that out loud.
Sounds good. Got a nice ring to it.

444
00:34:03,825 --> 00:34:06,350
Okay, you promise
you're gonna call me, daddy?

445
00:34:06,494 --> 00:34:09,361
- Yeah. I promise.
- You got a boyish grin.

446
00:34:09,497 --> 00:34:11,580
You're slick as a wolf.
I don't trust you.

447
00:34:11,581 --> 00:34:12,694
Hit me with your number.

448
00:34:12,867 --> 00:34:16,803
- I don't really have a number.
- What are you, fuckin' Amish?

449
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:18,962
No, I just got into town.

450
00:34:19,107 --> 00:34:19,900
I fuckin' love it.

451
00:34:19,901 --> 00:34:22,235
He's like a Poison video
waiting to happen, this guy.

452
00:34:22,376 --> 00:34:25,504
I tell you what: I'm gonna give you
my backup phone, okay?

453
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:27,311
I'm gonna call you on this.

454
00:34:27,312 --> 00:34:30,208
When I call you,
I want you to answer. Take it.

455
00:34:30,918 --> 00:34:32,579
Free minutes on the weekend, okay?

456
00:34:33,121 --> 00:34:35,316
Don't worry.
I only use it when I can't get a signal.

457
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:37,651
I'm outta here.
You look beautiful.

458
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:50,069
- Hello.
- Yes, daddy! You're on the team.

459
00:34:50,204 --> 00:34:53,002
That was a fuckin' test, and guess
who just passed. You did, my man.

460
00:34:53,141 --> 00:34:54,867
Does that girl play tambourine?

461
00:34:54,868 --> 00:34:57,373
I got another business
card for you, sweetie.

462
00:35:08,289 --> 00:35:11,281
No, no, leave those. We're counting.
He's gotta drive home to Orange County.

463
00:35:11,425 --> 00:35:13,416
Bullshit. Take 'em away.
I wanna lose count.

464
00:35:13,561 --> 00:35:15,620
Leave these.
I like these ones.

465
00:35:15,763 --> 00:35:18,163
- Put some more in that one.
- Fill me up. Thank you very much.

466
00:35:18,299 --> 00:35:19,823
Two of those.

467
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:24,314
Listen, I hate to do
it to you, sweetheart,

468
00:35:24,315 --> 00:35:25,435
but I gotta see some ID.

469
00:35:25,573 --> 00:35:27,404
That's fine.
I just want something to eat.

470
00:35:27,575 --> 00:35:28,240
Excuse me.

471
00:35:28,241 --> 00:35:31,102
I'll pay for whatever
it is that she wants.

472
00:35:31,979 --> 00:35:35,312
How's it going, huh? How are you?
You remember me.

473
00:35:35,449 --> 00:35:39,977
Come down here, just for a second.
Come down here for one second.

474
00:35:40,121 --> 00:35:42,248
I want you to meet
a good friend of mine. This is Nathan.

475
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:45,518
- How's it going?
- Just come down for one second.

476
00:35:46,327 --> 00:35:48,591
There we go.
That's my girl.

477
00:35:54,435 --> 00:35:57,131
- Do you get high?
- Not in years.

478
00:35:57,471 --> 00:35:59,564
Mind if I fire up?

479
00:36:00,541 --> 00:36:04,443
- It won't affect your driving?
- No, not really.

480
00:36:05,813 --> 00:36:07,974
I probably drive better stoned.

481
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:13,751
I'll take that as a yes.

482
00:36:24,298 --> 00:36:28,291
- How'd you find that picture of me?
- Ever since I saw that picture...

483
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:32,304
...I've been obsessed with you.
I always look at it.

484
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:36,303
I guess you're my dream girl.

485
00:36:38,713 --> 00:36:40,977
That picture was 10 years ago.

486
00:36:48,589 --> 00:36:50,887
I'm a working stiff.

487
00:36:51,058 --> 00:36:53,458
But I'm flattered.

488
00:36:54,195 --> 00:36:56,254
Do you have a boyfriend?

489
00:36:57,031 --> 00:36:58,828
Nope.

490
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:02,125
I live alone.

491
00:37:06,073 --> 00:37:08,303
Are you okay?

492
00:37:09,677 --> 00:37:11,736
Wow, that was quick.

493
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,747
Yeah.

494
00:37:13,948 --> 00:37:17,281
You know,
my girlfriend would love this place.

495
00:37:17,418 --> 00:37:19,409
How long you been here?

496
00:37:20,354 --> 00:37:22,345
Two years.

497
00:37:22,623 --> 00:37:26,150
But I'm just renting.
I already own a couple houses.

498
00:37:26,294 --> 00:37:29,286
I don't want all my money
in L.A. Real Estate.

499
00:37:31,365 --> 00:37:33,356
Smart.

500
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:42,840
Is this your fantasy?

501
00:37:44,979 --> 00:37:47,379
Something like that, yeah.

502
00:37:48,783 --> 00:37:53,379
If I acted out your fantasy,
would you do something for me?

503
00:37:53,654 --> 00:37:57,055
Maybe. I guess.

504
00:37:57,658 --> 00:37:59,649
Well, which is it?

505
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:02,519
What do you want me to do?

506
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:09,660
It depends.
What do you want me to do?

507
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:32,215
I'm sorry.

508
00:38:41,302 --> 00:38:43,293
No, no, no. Come here.

509
00:38:43,471 --> 00:38:45,962
Nathan, get a little closer to her.
She's not gonna bite.

510
00:38:46,107 --> 00:38:48,735
There you go. That's good.

511
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:54,345
Wow. God, you two look great together.
You should let me take your picture.

512
00:38:54,515 --> 00:38:57,507
- You just did.
- That's not what he means.

513
00:38:57,651 --> 00:39:01,018
- Well, what do you mean?
- Sexy pictures.

514
00:39:01,722 --> 00:39:05,658
You mean...? Well, how much?
I mean, like, how sexy?

515
00:39:05,793 --> 00:39:07,784
You know, that depends.

516
00:39:09,463 --> 00:39:11,097
Oh, man. You're packing.

517
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:14,093
That could be a pretty
good chunk of change.

518
00:39:15,403 --> 00:39:18,804
- You're kidding, right?
- No, he's not.

519
00:39:19,407 --> 00:39:22,035
I don't want my picture
all over the Internet.

520
00:39:22,176 --> 00:39:23,752
Sweetheart already sat for me.

521
00:39:23,753 --> 00:39:26,010
I don't even want your
head in my pictures.

522
00:39:26,147 --> 00:39:28,672
In fact, my clients prefer it
if they don't even see your face.

523
00:39:28,816 --> 00:39:30,807
It makes them
a little bit uncomfortable...

524
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:33,715
...to see another man's face
while they're... you know...

525
00:39:34,822 --> 00:39:36,483
...enjoying my pictures.

526
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:39,058
- I don't know.
- Come on. Listen, sweetheart.

527
00:39:39,226 --> 00:39:43,424
Another 2000, for an hour's work. 2000.

528
00:39:43,564 --> 00:39:46,897
Nathan. 2000, man.

529
00:39:47,435 --> 00:39:51,531
Come on. Look at her, dude.
She's asking you with her eyes, man.

530
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:54,501
Let's party.
Let's do this.

531
00:39:54,909 --> 00:39:57,309
- Okay, but I need another shot.
- Another shot for all of us.

532
00:39:57,445 --> 00:39:59,811
Come on, come on.
Hey, Huey.

533
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:05,381
Sammy. It's a really cool name.
It's, like, totally biblical, right?

534
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:06,982
I really think your
music's amazing.

535
00:40:06,983 --> 00:40:08,682
I can totally hear you
on the radio already.

536
00:40:12,059 --> 00:40:15,790
All right, you have to be quiet.
My aunt's sleeping. Okay?

537
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:32,505
I wanna take your picture.

538
00:40:35,082 --> 00:40:36,481
Okay.

539
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:41,010
Take off your shirt.

540
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:05,869
Now your pants.

541
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:23,795
What's wrong with you?
Come on, look at her.

542
00:41:23,931 --> 00:41:26,331
What?
She doesn't do it for you?

543
00:41:26,467 --> 00:41:28,594
I'm sorry.

544
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:31,568
Okay. I still get paid, no matter what.

545
00:41:33,541 --> 00:41:35,008
All right.

546
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:39,076
Already a seasoned professional.

547
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,880
All right, look.
What's going on?

548
00:41:42,016 --> 00:41:44,484
Okay. Look, man,
I really don't think this is a good idea.

549
00:41:44,618 --> 00:41:46,415
Why? Come on, it'll be fun.

550
00:41:46,554 --> 00:41:50,012
I'm just not into her.
You know what I mean?

551
00:41:53,561 --> 00:41:56,621
Oh, right. Okay.
I understand. Hold on.

552
00:41:59,166 --> 00:42:01,691
I think this is more your style, huh?

553
00:42:03,304 --> 00:42:05,772
It figures, with a
schlong like yours, huh?

554
00:42:10,911 --> 00:42:12,902
All right, come on over here.

555
00:42:15,916 --> 00:42:17,907
Take your coat off.

556
00:42:32,466 --> 00:42:34,457
All right, now turn around.

557
00:42:36,003 --> 00:42:38,631
Didn't you check it out before?

558
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:41,138
Yeah, I did.
I wanna see it again.

559
00:42:55,022 --> 00:42:57,252
- Everything in its place?
- Very nice.

560
00:43:07,735 --> 00:43:09,225
Very good.

561
00:43:13,407 --> 00:43:15,898
I don't want you talking anymore.

562
00:43:16,043 --> 00:43:18,204
The only thing
I want you to say is, "Yes, sir."

563
00:43:19,113 --> 00:43:20,774
Yes, sir.

564
00:43:20,948 --> 00:43:23,246
Now go look at yourself in the mirror.
Fix it.

565
00:43:23,384 --> 00:43:25,249
Yes, sir.

566
00:43:29,923 --> 00:43:32,790
Okay. Interesting.

567
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:52,979
All right, that's good.
Now come over here.

568
00:44:05,392 --> 00:44:09,021
All right, hold it.
That's nice.

569
00:44:09,563 --> 00:44:13,226
Let me just look at that.

570
00:44:14,768 --> 00:44:17,293
Okay, now go lay down on the couch.

571
00:44:19,106 --> 00:44:21,097
Yes, sir.

572
00:44:30,117 --> 00:44:31,584
Whoa.

573
00:44:33,253 --> 00:44:35,244
Let's get some breakfast.

574
00:44:37,191 --> 00:44:39,785
I gotta feed my dog,
and get to the office.

575
00:44:42,129 --> 00:44:43,596
Well...

576
00:44:44,331 --> 00:44:47,926
...then I'll just wait
for you to call me.

577
00:44:50,804 --> 00:44:53,602
I'd never done anything like that before.

578
00:45:05,753 --> 00:45:08,620
Hey. Where did you go?
I was worried.

579
00:45:08,756 --> 00:45:11,088
I just went out with some friends.

580
00:45:11,225 --> 00:45:15,093
- You stayed up all night.
- Yeah.

581
00:45:15,229 --> 00:45:17,220
You should be more careful.

582
00:45:21,168 --> 00:45:23,500
Go get some sleep in my bed.

583
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:12,141
What are you doing here?

584
00:46:15,756 --> 00:46:17,223
Hey.

585
00:46:18,125 --> 00:46:21,617
Hey. What are you doing here?

586
00:46:21,795 --> 00:46:23,956
I'm a friend of Nathan's.

587
00:46:25,566 --> 00:46:27,557
Are you two lovers?

588
00:46:29,436 --> 00:46:32,496
No. Nothing like that.

589
00:46:34,775 --> 00:46:38,040
Well, don't let me disturb you.

590
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:02,865
- What can I get for you?
- Actually, I saw your sign outside.

591
00:47:03,003 --> 00:47:04,994
I was wondering
if you guys are still hiring.

592
00:47:05,138 --> 00:47:07,606
Yeah, we're hiring. But we may
have already found someone.

593
00:47:08,742 --> 00:47:12,940
Well, could I at least write down
my name or something, just in case...

594
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:17,676
- You looking for a job?
- Kind of. I mean, yeah.

595
00:47:21,688 --> 00:47:23,087
Call me.

596
00:47:24,625 --> 00:47:27,617
- What do you want? It's on me.
- Really?

597
00:47:27,761 --> 00:47:31,094
- Yeah. What do you want?
- Okay. Can I get a hot chocolate?

598
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:33,756
Hot chocolate.
Good, very good. Very sweet.

599
00:47:33,901 --> 00:47:37,769
So I'll have a latte,
extra hot, non-fat.

600
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:44,907
Hello? Anna?

601
00:47:54,788 --> 00:47:56,380
Anna?

602
00:47:59,526 --> 00:48:01,517
Anna, hey.
What's going on?

603
00:48:01,662 --> 00:48:05,223
I'm leaving.
I can't take another day of this.

604
00:48:05,732 --> 00:48:07,324
Of what?

605
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:11,127
I don't know, Todd.

606
00:48:11,271 --> 00:48:15,799
Everything around here is so dark,
and I'm just looking for some light.

607
00:48:18,011 --> 00:48:20,241
Can you close that?

608
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:22,615
Yeah.

609
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:28,485
- It's broken.
- All right.

610
00:48:28,622 --> 00:48:30,487
Where you gonna go?

611
00:48:30,624 --> 00:48:32,819
I'm gonna go stay at Donna's.

612
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:35,861
I'll come back for my stuff
in a couple of days.

613
00:48:36,763 --> 00:48:39,357
- We broke up.
- Why?

614
00:48:39,499 --> 00:48:40,966
I don't know.

615
00:48:44,638 --> 00:48:47,630
We hardly ever
saw each other anymore.

616
00:48:48,575 --> 00:48:51,703
- I don't think she thought I loved her.
- Did you?

617
00:48:51,845 --> 00:48:56,043
I don't know.
Can we not get into this today?

618
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:58,515
What does love mean to you?

619
00:49:00,988 --> 00:49:04,185
Love. Love is something I can't have.

620
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:09,989
I don't believe love exists for me.

621
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:12,521
Did you love Anna?

622
00:49:14,001 --> 00:49:17,596
I wanna talk about something else.
I don't wanna talk about this.

623
00:49:17,738 --> 00:49:20,468
It's your session.
What do you want to talk about?

624
00:49:21,274 --> 00:49:23,936
Well, I don't know.

625
00:49:24,111 --> 00:49:28,275
It was good. All right, here he comes.
I'll call you later.

626
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:33,686
That's your phone.
Maybe it's Joey.

627
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:37,381
- Yeah, or somebody for Joey.
- Oh, just answer it.

628
00:49:43,030 --> 00:49:45,089
- Hello?
- <i>Hey, kid. How's it going?</i>

629
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:47,894
- <i>You get some last night?</i>
- Get some what?

630
00:49:48,035 --> 00:49:49,233
<i>Hey, that's your business.</i>

631
00:49:49,234 --> 00:49:50,902
<i>My business is music,
daddy, all right?</i>

632
00:49:51,038 --> 00:49:53,621
<i>I want you to come by the
studio and meet some people.</i>

633
00:49:53,622 --> 00:49:54,496
<i>You have a pen?</i>

634
00:49:54,641 --> 00:49:56,370
- Yes.
- Yeah, yeah.

635
00:49:56,510 --> 00:49:57,948
<i>You're playing coy.
I like that.</i>

636
00:49:57,949 --> 00:50:00,105
<i>I saw that sexy little devil
you were with last night.</i>

637
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:01,852
<i>It's on Rowena
and Silver Lake.</i>

638
00:50:01,853 --> 00:50:03,580
<i>I want you to get
there around 4:00.</i>

639
00:50:03,717 --> 00:50:05,346
<i>You're gonna see
me waiting outside.</i>

640
00:50:05,347 --> 00:50:07,050
<i>I'm gonna walk you up,
so don't be late.</i>

641
00:50:07,187 --> 00:50:09,781
Yeah, okay. All right.

642
00:50:13,393 --> 00:50:14,860
That is so cool!

643
00:50:15,028 --> 00:50:16,080
Is this "Making the Band"?

644
00:50:16,081 --> 00:50:17,861
I'm not holding auditions.
Yeah, I gotta go.

645
00:50:17,998 --> 00:50:19,989
Let's go.
Time is money, time is money.

646
00:50:20,133 --> 00:50:22,727
I'm sweating like Patrick Ewing
in the 4th quarter of game seven.

647
00:50:22,869 --> 00:50:25,599
- Jesus, kid. Where you sleeping?
- At a friend's house.

648
00:50:25,739 --> 00:50:29,004
Yeah? Who's your friend, baby Jesus?
Look like you been sleeping in a manger.

649
00:50:29,142 --> 00:50:31,372
Let's go.
Whatever, it's a look.

650
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:33,323
Hey. What's crackin', guys?

651
00:50:33,324 --> 00:50:35,810
Dude, this is the fucking
kid I was telling you about.

652
00:50:35,949 --> 00:50:37,940
This is Sammy.
The kid's a fucking genius.

653
00:50:38,085 --> 00:50:39,142
Sammy, this is Everbright.

654
00:50:39,143 --> 00:50:41,418
That's Harry, that's Kevin,
and that's Neil right there.

655
00:50:41,555 --> 00:50:43,113
How's it going, Sam?

656
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:45,417
- So you ready to sing something?
- Yeah, whatever.

657
00:50:45,559 --> 00:50:48,392
I love it. The kid's always on the go.
Kev, give me the lyric sheet.

658
00:50:50,797 --> 00:50:52,788
- Dude, how was that weed I gave you?
- So good.

659
00:50:52,933 --> 00:50:55,231
Dude, it melted your face off, didn't it?

660
00:50:55,368 --> 00:50:58,633
- Can I hear the track?
- Roll that shit, roll that shit.

661
00:51:02,576 --> 00:51:05,773
It's like listening to the Beatles'
White Album for the first time.

662
00:51:11,585 --> 00:51:14,053
Pop off this shit, pop off it.

663
00:51:17,190 --> 00:51:20,921
This is cool. I like it. It's poppy.

664
00:51:21,094 --> 00:51:23,324
You should give me a minute
to work on the lyrics, or whatever.

665
00:51:23,463 --> 00:51:26,193
He's gonna feel it out
like Ray Charles looking for a cricket.

666
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:29,325
I'll be his silent mom in the corner.
I'm not gonna say a goddamn thing.

667
00:51:29,469 --> 00:51:31,869
How 'bout you, sweetie?
You party on a school night?

668
00:51:32,005 --> 00:51:33,905
Oh, my gosh.

669
00:51:38,145 --> 00:51:40,909
Fifty bucks.
PayPal it to me.

670
00:51:41,081 --> 00:51:43,072
Yeah, okay, hold on.

671
00:51:50,557 --> 00:51:52,957
- <i>You should have it.</i>
- The URL is registered...

672
00:51:53,093 --> 00:51:58,690
...to 5045 Prospect, box #409.
It's a mailbox shop.

673
00:51:59,032 --> 00:52:01,500
- <i>The name on the account is fake.</i>
- How do you know?

674
00:52:01,635 --> 00:52:04,536
<i>"IB Horny".</i>
<i>Sound real to you?</i>

675
00:52:23,256 --> 00:52:27,249
God bless, brother. God bless.

676
00:52:48,748 --> 00:52:52,514
Thanks... Mr. Horny.

677
00:52:55,288 --> 00:52:56,880
Check.

678
00:52:58,825 --> 00:53:02,158
<i>Yeah, I could come up a bit.
It's cool.</i>

679
00:53:02,562 --> 00:53:04,553
Check. Yeah, it's good.

680
00:53:25,719 --> 00:53:27,710
He changed the lyrics.

681
00:53:27,854 --> 00:53:29,981
Just listen to it for a second.

682
00:53:40,066 --> 00:53:43,524
What did I tell you? The kid's a genius.
Remember who found him.

683
00:53:44,604 --> 00:53:46,595
Wonderboy changed the lyrics, man.

684
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:49,800
It's sounding better, honestly.
It's still good quality.

685
00:53:49,943 --> 00:53:51,934
Well, it sounds good.
He's got a good voice.

686
00:53:52,078 --> 00:53:54,876
But it's not the same.
I mean, he changed all the lyrics.

687
00:54:19,572 --> 00:54:23,508
- Do you want one?
- No, I'm cool.

688
00:54:25,578 --> 00:54:29,309
She's pretty.
What is she, like seventeen?

689
00:54:29,449 --> 00:54:31,940
Eighteen, I think.

690
00:54:32,786 --> 00:54:35,914
- Is that her BMW outside?
- Yeah.

691
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:41,118
Anyway...

692
00:54:41,194 --> 00:54:44,652
...I just came by to get my stuff...

693
00:54:46,933 --> 00:54:49,527
...and thank you.
- Thank me?

694
00:54:50,270 --> 00:54:52,329
Are you really gonna thank me?

695
00:54:53,873 --> 00:54:55,864
What do you mean?

696
00:54:56,009 --> 00:55:00,469
I don't know. I guess I just thought
this would turn into something more.

697
00:55:01,147 --> 00:55:03,138
You staying here.

698
00:55:10,290 --> 00:55:14,226
Yeah, okay.
But I want some pot.

699
00:55:23,803 --> 00:55:25,794
- Hey.
- Hey.

700
00:55:27,707 --> 00:55:31,040
I gotta help Nathan with something.

701
00:55:31,177 --> 00:55:35,238
So I'll... I should get a ride
back to your place later.

702
00:55:36,449 --> 00:55:38,917
- No, I'll wait for you.
- No.

703
00:55:40,387 --> 00:55:42,514
That's not gonna work.

704
00:55:50,263 --> 00:55:52,390
I'll see you in a couple hours.

705
00:56:05,945 --> 00:56:08,607
<i>- Greetings, soldier.</i>
<i>- Greetings, my friend.</i>

706
00:56:08,748 --> 00:56:11,148
<i>I hail from the Kirklactic Empire.</i>

707
00:56:11,284 --> 00:56:14,048
<i>I've heard quite a
bit about that place.</i>

708
00:56:14,554 --> 00:56:17,284
<i>We've penetrated</i>
<i>the far reaches of space.</i>

709
00:56:17,424 --> 00:56:20,018
<i>You've penetrated everything</i>
<i>you've come in contact with...</i>

710
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:22,151
<i>... according to my sources.</i>

711
00:56:37,911 --> 00:56:39,572
<i>Studio.</i>

712
00:56:39,712 --> 00:56:43,307
Yeah. Hi.
I'd like to model.

713
00:56:43,450 --> 00:56:46,222
<i>You and everyone
else in this town.</i>

714
00:56:46,223 --> 00:56:47,318
<i>Come on in.</i>

715
00:56:52,125 --> 00:56:55,151
- What the hell is going on?
- Hey, come on back here.

716
00:56:55,328 --> 00:56:56,259
It's an amateur site.

717
00:56:56,260 --> 00:56:58,786
Half of the pictures I receive
are from fans of the site.

718
00:56:58,932 --> 00:57:03,733
They send in pictures of ex-girlfriends,
strippers, girls they saw on the beach.

719
00:57:03,870 --> 00:57:07,533
- Isn't that illegal?
- When they hit the return button...

720
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:12,270
...they agree they have the rights to the
pictures, and it's no longer my problem.

721
00:57:12,412 --> 00:57:15,540
So do you know
who sent you those photos?

722
00:57:15,715 --> 00:57:16,591
All right, look.

723
00:57:16,592 --> 00:57:19,549
I'll take them off the site, okay?
Just give me $5000.

724
00:57:19,686 --> 00:57:21,677
They're one of the most popular
set of pictures on the site.

725
00:57:21,821 --> 00:57:24,016
Yeah, fine.

726
00:57:24,157 --> 00:57:27,354
- Two thousand.
- Honey, he just agreed to five.

727
00:57:27,494 --> 00:57:30,361
If you wanna renegotiate,
the price is gonna go up.

728
00:57:30,497 --> 00:57:32,423
All right, look.
I know who you are.

729
00:57:32,424 --> 00:57:34,558
I read the real estate
section on Sundays.

730
00:57:35,034 --> 00:57:38,231
Actually, I was maybe gonna
talk to you about my house.

731
00:57:38,371 --> 00:57:41,169
Tell me, do you think
this is a good time to sell, or...?

732
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:49,372
Call my office.

733
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:52,518
Wow. Who took the picture?

734
00:57:52,652 --> 00:57:55,917
I could do a much better job,
Sally St. Clair.

735
00:57:56,589 --> 00:57:59,524
- If you change your mind, call me.
- Thank you.

736
00:57:59,659 --> 00:58:02,594
As you see,
that's only some of my work.

737
00:58:03,463 --> 00:58:06,330
- Sorry about the stairs.
- No problem.

738
00:58:06,466 --> 00:58:07,933
Nice... I like your stuff.

739
00:58:17,210 --> 00:58:20,145
- You're early.
- Yeah, well...

740
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:22,510
I didn't know how long this would take.

741
00:58:23,616 --> 00:58:27,074
- Where do you live?
- I'm staying with my cousin right now.

742
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:31,418
But I wanna get my own place soon.
I'm saving up some money.

743
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:33,885
Well, I can help you out with that.

744
00:58:35,228 --> 00:58:37,508
Go get me a large,
non-fat latte, extra hot.

745
00:58:37,509 --> 00:58:39,028
And get something for yourself.

746
00:58:39,165 --> 00:58:40,564
Okay.

747
00:58:42,902 --> 00:58:46,360
Becky? Hello, Becky.

748
00:58:46,506 --> 00:58:48,497
Unlock this door, young lady.

749
00:58:48,641 --> 00:58:51,474
- Shh, be quiet.
- Is someone in there with you?

750
00:58:51,644 --> 00:58:53,005
I heard voices last night.

751
00:58:53,006 --> 00:58:55,307
You're not allowed to
keep this door locked.

752
00:58:55,448 --> 00:58:57,439
What are you talking about?
It's unlocked.

753
00:59:09,195 --> 00:59:10,662
April?

754
00:59:14,467 --> 00:59:16,594
What are you doing here?

755
00:59:17,737 --> 00:59:21,229
- Sally, she offered me a job.
- A job? What job? My job?

756
00:59:21,541 --> 00:59:25,136
Nathan. This is our new intern, April.

757
00:59:25,945 --> 00:59:28,641
- Nathan. It's nice to meet you.
- It's nice to meet you too.

758
00:59:28,815 --> 00:59:31,340
You know, you look really familiar to me.

759
00:59:32,852 --> 00:59:36,515
- Do you two know each other?
- I don't think so.

760
00:59:36,689 --> 00:59:39,283
Maybe I've just seen a picture of you
someplace, then.

761
00:59:39,425 --> 00:59:42,519
No. I don't think so.

762
00:59:45,765 --> 00:59:48,165
I told April she could stay at your
place for a couple of days.

763
00:59:48,301 --> 00:59:51,429
No really, that's okay.
I can just go stay at my cousin's.

764
00:59:51,604 --> 00:59:53,629
And sleep on the sofa? No.

765
00:59:53,773 --> 00:59:57,903
It's fine. We have an extra bedroom.
It's no problem. Right, Nathan?

766
00:59:58,678 --> 01:00:00,669
Of course not.

767
01:00:01,981 --> 01:00:06,315
Sally St. Clair's office.
Postcard in the mail?

768
01:00:06,452 --> 01:00:09,444
Okay, enough small talk. Nathan,
I'm sure you can keep April busy.

769
01:00:09,589 --> 01:00:11,716
I'll do my best.
What are you doing here?

770
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:14,986
I ran into Sally at a coffee shop.
I was applying for a job.

771
01:00:15,128 --> 01:00:16,527
Sally St. Clair's office.

772
01:00:16,663 --> 01:00:19,325
I don't know what's going on,
but you find your own apartment.

773
01:00:19,465 --> 01:00:21,524
Can you hold please?
Thank you.

774
01:00:23,469 --> 01:00:27,337
Carlos.
Hi, it's me, Becky.

775
01:00:27,473 --> 01:00:30,806
Listen, I need you
to do something for me...

776
01:00:36,482 --> 01:00:39,883
This neighborhood is a little sketch,
but you can crash here for a while.

777
01:00:53,633 --> 01:00:55,489
Carlos said he would be here.

778
01:00:55,490 --> 01:00:58,434
Dude's a real stoner,
so anything is possible.

779
01:01:02,842 --> 01:01:05,037
I just talked to him.

780
01:01:13,586 --> 01:01:16,851
Yo, Becky. What's up?

781
01:01:16,989 --> 01:01:18,980
Carlos, you reek.

782
01:01:19,325 --> 01:01:22,192
Just doin' some B-52s.
Did you guys want one?

783
01:01:22,662 --> 01:01:24,721
No. But it smells like some good shit.

784
01:01:24,864 --> 01:01:26,991
Yeah. Some dude out of Diamond Bar.

785
01:01:27,133 --> 01:01:29,795
Hydroponic,
featured in <i>High Times.</i>

786
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:33,929
I mean, everybody's going crazy for it.
I'm just lucky I got it.

787
01:01:36,209 --> 01:01:38,939
Dude, take the trash out
every once in a while.

788
01:01:39,078 --> 01:01:41,273
I know.

789
01:01:42,281 --> 01:01:44,772
I've been really, really busy.

790
01:01:57,463 --> 01:02:00,330
- What are you doing?
- What do you mean?

791
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:04,960
- You left me to lock up the office.
- I asked Sally if I could go.

792
01:02:05,638 --> 01:02:09,597
Look, you're the low man
on the totem pole, okay? You ask me.

793
01:02:09,642 --> 01:02:11,735
Okay.
Now can I take my fucking shower?

794
01:02:12,712 --> 01:02:14,703
Yeah, sure.

795
01:02:14,847 --> 01:02:16,838
Finish your shower.

796
01:02:16,983 --> 01:02:19,417
You better not use my washcloth, okay?

797
01:02:25,792 --> 01:02:28,852
So you're the guy
responsible for all of this.

798
01:02:29,662 --> 01:02:33,530
You're really not supposed to be in here.
But no, I'm not responsible for all this.

799
01:02:33,666 --> 01:02:35,793
There's a guy that comes by
a couple times a week...

800
01:02:35,935 --> 01:02:38,335
...to make sure everything's
doing what it's supposed to.

801
01:02:38,738 --> 01:02:40,729
I just kinda like spraying 'em.

802
01:02:42,141 --> 01:02:44,132
It relaxes me.

803
01:02:52,618 --> 01:02:55,815
Sorry, do you want a couple buds?

804
01:02:56,155 --> 01:02:59,682
Sure. Yeah, yeah.
That'd be great.

805
01:03:01,761 --> 01:03:05,697
Here you go.
Let it dry out for a couple days first.

806
01:03:05,898 --> 01:03:07,525
Wow.

807
01:03:18,177 --> 01:03:20,702
This is some good stuff, man.

808
01:03:22,048 --> 01:03:25,711
- Where'd you get it?
- This cat I know.

809
01:03:26,519 --> 01:03:29,920
You get some more of this stuff, man,
I want some.

810
01:03:30,056 --> 01:03:33,253
Turn the fuckin' music down, man!

811
01:03:33,392 --> 01:03:36,850
- So, what's Becky's story?
- She's a sweetheart, man.

812
01:03:36,996 --> 01:03:41,296
I mean, her dad's, like,
this really rich guy. He's never home.

813
01:03:42,201 --> 01:03:43,862
She's into me.

814
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:50,573
We met in this creative writing class.

815
01:03:50,743 --> 01:03:53,075
She really likes my poetry.

816
01:03:57,817 --> 01:04:02,151
I wanna go to fuckin' sleep, man!
Turn the fuckin' music off!

817
01:04:02,288 --> 01:04:06,418
- It's warm.
- Don't worry about it. Fridge is broke.

818
01:04:08,828 --> 01:04:11,353
What do you think you can get
for that weed, man?

819
01:04:12,164 --> 01:04:14,155
I don't know, man.

820
01:04:15,034 --> 01:04:17,025
A lot of money.

821
01:04:17,169 --> 01:04:20,161
This is, like,
the best stuff I've smoked in years.

822
01:04:21,173 --> 01:04:23,300
I smoke a lot of pot.

823
01:04:24,977 --> 01:04:28,037
So do you know "Free Bird"?

824
01:04:28,714 --> 01:04:32,514
Fucking Christ! Turn it off!

825
01:04:32,685 --> 01:04:34,676
Come on, let's smile now.
Come on.

826
01:04:34,820 --> 01:04:38,312
Look like you're enjoying it,
all right? Yeah.

827
01:04:38,457 --> 01:04:40,448
Okay, isn't that enough?

828
01:04:40,860 --> 01:04:44,193
You said you'd let me
take some pictures. Come on.

829
01:04:44,730 --> 01:04:47,198
This has nothing to do with real estate.

830
01:04:48,801 --> 01:04:50,928
How's that tape treating you?

831
01:04:51,671 --> 01:04:54,936
I transferred it to my computer
so I can edit it.

832
01:04:57,143 --> 01:04:59,134
Do I get a copy?

833
01:04:59,278 --> 01:05:01,269
Do you want a copy?

834
01:05:03,950 --> 01:05:06,942
- I'll get back to you on that.
- Oh, okay.

835
01:05:10,756 --> 01:05:12,815
You know, my girlfriend moved out.

836
01:05:15,761 --> 01:05:17,228
That was sudden.

837
01:05:17,363 --> 01:05:21,163
We haven't had sex for six months,
so that's not really.

838
01:05:24,036 --> 01:05:27,836
Are you one of those freaks that can
only get off on tapes and everything?

839
01:05:31,243 --> 01:05:34,576
I don't know what came first:
My lack of interest in her...

840
01:05:34,714 --> 01:05:37,410
...or my complete obsession with you.

841
01:05:47,126 --> 01:05:49,321
It's good I get into bed early tonight.

842
01:05:49,462 --> 01:05:52,192
I got a yoga class in the morning.

843
01:05:53,466 --> 01:05:56,867
- I was that young.
- Younger.

844
01:05:58,871 --> 01:06:00,930
Yeah, you're right.

845
01:06:01,107 --> 01:06:03,667
- You do yoga?
- Yeah.

846
01:06:04,276 --> 01:06:06,073
Birkram.

847
01:06:06,212 --> 01:06:09,238
- Can you unlock the door?
- You know, you sweat. You're sweaty.

848
01:06:10,683 --> 01:06:15,017
Wait, wait, wait. Let him
get to the bottom of the street first.

849
01:06:15,821 --> 01:06:19,279
And don't turn on the lights
'til they get out of the hills.

850
01:06:47,653 --> 01:06:50,087
- He's not gonna walk her to the door.
- This is great.

851
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:53,054
He's waiting for her to get in.
Now's our chance. Just follow me.

852
01:06:53,192 --> 01:06:56,650
- Wait. What's the plan?
- Just stick with me.

853
01:07:04,737 --> 01:07:08,138
Hey! What?
No, no! What the fuck?

854
01:07:10,276 --> 01:07:13,871
Who are you, man? What do
you want? What are you doing?

855
01:07:14,013 --> 01:07:16,481
- Shut up.
- Stop.

856
01:07:19,385 --> 01:07:22,411
We've got a little surprise
for you, David.

857
01:07:25,725 --> 01:07:28,489
Now I'm gonna pull you into the car.

858
01:07:28,627 --> 01:07:31,027
If you try anything, I'll break
your fucking neck. You got that?

859
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:24,072
- It's my favorite song.
- I can tell.

860
01:08:27,419 --> 01:08:30,411
- Where are you going?
- My cousin, she invited me to a dinner.

861
01:08:30,556 --> 01:08:33,116
It's a congratulations
for me getting a new job.

862
01:08:34,460 --> 01:08:35,984
You want?

863
01:08:37,096 --> 01:08:41,556
They're gonna give me shit.
But I don't care.

864
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:46,098
I knew Sally was gonna
find somebody else.

865
01:08:46,238 --> 01:08:49,105
I'm too stoned all the time.
I'm fucking shit up.

866
01:08:49,241 --> 01:08:51,232
It's exactly what happened
to the last guy.

867
01:08:51,410 --> 01:08:53,401
Oh, don't say that.

868
01:08:53,546 --> 01:08:56,174
Maybe you should just stop smoking
every night, and mellow out.

869
01:08:56,315 --> 01:08:59,375
You think I care about this job?
You think I wanna work in real estate?

870
01:08:59,518 --> 01:09:02,180
I mean, every other person...
Nobody knows what they want.

871
01:09:02,321 --> 01:09:04,312
It's like, if they want a house
with a sauna...

872
01:09:04,456 --> 01:09:06,447
...the full bedroom
can have only partial light.

873
01:09:06,592 --> 01:09:08,054
But Mrs. Son-of-a-Bitch
can't sleep

874
01:09:08,055 --> 01:09:09,720
unless there's a lot
of light in the room.

875
01:09:09,862 --> 01:09:13,821
Mr. Son-of-a-Bitch can't sleep because
there's too much light in the room.

876
01:09:13,999 --> 01:09:16,399
It's like Goldilocks grew up
and got married.

877
01:09:16,535 --> 01:09:19,663
And all of a sudden,
nobody knows what they want anymore.

878
01:09:19,805 --> 01:09:23,536
That's not what I want.
I mean, you wanna work in real estate?

879
01:09:25,511 --> 01:09:27,911
I don't even really know
what I wanna do.

880
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:31,811
Me, I came out here to be a dancer.

881
01:09:33,819 --> 01:09:37,949
Like I was gonna be one of those people
poppin' in the Missy Elliott videos.

882
01:09:39,358 --> 01:09:40,916
Funny, huh?

883
01:09:43,028 --> 01:09:44,859
You know, we should go dancing.

884
01:09:46,165 --> 01:09:49,623
- No, I don't wanna go dancing.
- Come on, I'm in my party dress.

885
01:09:49,802 --> 01:09:51,929
What about your cousin?

886
01:09:52,438 --> 01:09:54,998
You think I really wanna see them
making out?

887
01:09:56,909 --> 01:09:59,036
Okay, okay.

888
01:09:59,211 --> 01:10:01,839
Come, come. Come on.

889
01:10:02,014 --> 01:10:03,191
<i>Since the mid-1990s,</i>

890
01:10:03,192 --> 01:10:05,108
<i>the central government

01:10:20,132 --> 01:10:22,794
Yeah. I got it.

- Hello?
- <i>What are you doing?</i>

899

- Nothing, really.
- <i>Well, who are you with?</i>

900
01:10:39,485 --> 01:10:42,943
- Just hanging with Carlos.
- <i>Carlos?</i>

901
01:10:43,889 --> 01:10:46,413

my deep, dark secrets?

904
01:10:55,234 --> 01:10:56,701
Sure.

905
01:10:57,736 --> 01:11:00,569
No. I wanna hear you say it.

906
01:11:00,706 --> 01:11:02,731
I want you to say it in front of Carlos.

907
01:11:02,908 --> 01:11:05,570
I just farted, man.
Can you smell it?

908
01:11:08,781 --> 01:11:12,717
I... I miss you.

909
01:11:15,721 --> 01:11:17,712
Do you want me to come over?

910
01:11:19,591 --> 01:11:22,788
Sure, I guess. What are we gonna do,
sleep on the floor?

911
01:11:22,962 --> 01:11:25,624
I don't care.
I just wanna see you.

912
01:11:26,065 --> 01:11:28,056
You're pussy-whipped, dude.

913
01:11:31,270 --> 01:11:34,603
Okay. I'll see you soon.

Hey. Hope that didn't hurt too much.

919
01:12:16,482 --> 01:12:17,915

Come over here, Sally.
Come on over.

922
01:12:32,865 --> 01:12:34,992
Okay, Dave.

See this?

I'm gonna pull this ball gag out of
your mouth. But if you try anything...

01:12:51,483 --> 01:12:54,884
...I'm gonna hit you so hard,
you'll lose your hearing. You got that?

927
01:12:55,020 --> 01:12:56,487
All right.

928
01:12:57,289 --> 01:13:01,350
- Jesus, Sally. What is this?
- Where are the pictures?

929
01:13:01,493 --> 01:13:03,552
- What pictures?
- All of 'em.

930
01:13:04,430 --> 01:13:06,830
Of Sally. Of everyone.

931
01:13:07,499 --> 01:13:11,026
I want all the pictures,
you fuckin' pervert.

932
01:13:11,437 --> 01:13:12,532
I don't know who you are,

933
01:13:12,533 --> 01:13:14,372
or what it is that
you think you're doing.

934
01:13:14,506 --> 01:13:17,566
He is my friend.
And he's here to help me.

935
01:13:17,709 --> 01:13:20,439
Now, I want all the pictures
you've taken of me.

936
01:13:20,979 --> 01:13:24,745
You see, Davey, some of those pictures
ended up on the Internet.

937
01:13:24,917 --> 01:13:28,683
Sure. I mean, whatever.
Take all the pictures.

938
01:13:28,854 --> 01:13:32,255
And I want three of your listings.

939
01:13:32,858 --> 01:13:35,053
Three of your houses
that you have on the market.

940
01:13:35,227 --> 01:13:37,320
Come on, how can I do that?

941
01:13:37,463 --> 01:13:41,194
Call 'em up and say
you can't help them anymore.

942
01:13:41,333 --> 01:13:43,597
A medical problem.

943
01:13:43,735 --> 01:13:45,726
And that you recommend me.

944
01:13:46,138 --> 01:13:48,368
You don't think
you're gonna get away with this, do ya?

945
01:13:48,540 --> 01:13:52,135
With all the underage girls you parade
through here for photo shoots?

946
01:13:52,277 --> 01:13:56,008
What are you, gonna go to the cops?
I don't think so.

947
01:13:56,148 --> 01:13:58,946
Honey, what are you doing
with a guy like that?

948
01:13:59,751 --> 01:14:01,878
What was I doing
with a guy like you, huh?

949
01:14:03,021 --> 01:14:05,751
I'm always looking
for someone to help me.

950
01:14:05,891 --> 01:14:07,722
You know what Dad was like.

951
01:14:09,294 --> 01:14:12,752
This is some good stuff.
You're very talented.

952
01:14:12,931 --> 01:14:15,729
Yeah, thank you. Asshole.

953
01:14:16,969 --> 01:14:19,529
- Are my photos in there?
- Well, there's lots of boxes.

954
01:14:19,705 --> 01:14:22,435
We'll just have to take it all.

955
01:14:30,048 --> 01:14:32,039
I love this song.

956
01:14:33,652 --> 01:14:36,849
- So, what's your story?
- Oh, my story?

957
01:14:37,923 --> 01:14:41,450
I'm from Lincoln Nebraska,
and I was raised by my grandma.

958
01:14:41,593 --> 01:14:44,338
And my only friend in high
school joined the Army.

959
01:14:44,339 --> 01:14:45,791
So I had to get outta there.

960
01:14:45,931 --> 01:14:47,922
No...

961
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:50,791
I mean...

962
01:14:51,470 --> 01:14:53,461
Do you like girls?

963
01:14:54,673 --> 01:14:56,937
Yeah, I like girls.

964
01:14:57,075 --> 01:14:59,066
Do you like me?

965
01:15:00,479 --> 01:15:02,071
Yeah, I like you.

966
01:15:05,217 --> 01:15:08,345
Do you like guys
more than you like girls?

967
01:15:18,263 --> 01:15:20,527
Come on, Little Miss Missy.
Learn how to dance.

968
01:15:20,699 --> 01:15:24,601
Just give me a second, okay?
I'm not exactly used to this sort of...

969
01:15:24,770 --> 01:15:27,637
- Excuses, excuses.
- You just gotta give me a minute, okay?

970
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:38,477
Yeah, go. Peace.
Bye! Have fun.

971
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:23,751
Follow me.

972
01:16:40,312 --> 01:16:42,303
You don't like guys.

973
01:16:44,316 --> 01:16:46,307
Are you some frat boy fucking with me?

974
01:16:46,451 --> 01:16:49,181
No, man.
I never even went to college.

975
01:16:49,354 --> 01:16:52,380
Where do you think you're going, man?
Stay there.

976
01:16:52,524 --> 01:16:54,719
I didn't come in here for nothing.

977
01:17:29,061 --> 01:17:31,052
You can't stay here.

978
01:17:32,097 --> 01:17:34,565
It's fine, don't worry about it.

979
01:17:36,568 --> 01:17:39,503
No, this place is gross.

980
01:17:39,638 --> 01:17:41,367
I'll clean it up.

981
01:17:43,842 --> 01:17:47,972
How can you be inspired to write
anything beautiful in a place like this?

982
01:17:49,381 --> 01:17:51,576
Just leave that to me.

983
01:17:52,084 --> 01:17:53,642
No.

984
01:17:55,253 --> 01:17:59,155
I found you.
You're my discovery.

985
01:18:01,460 --> 01:18:03,951
Hey. Can I get a large, non-fat latte...

986
01:18:04,129 --> 01:18:06,654
...and a regular, small coffee.

987
01:18:07,199 --> 01:18:09,190
Okay. That'll be $5.65.

988
01:18:32,290 --> 01:18:36,021
Good morning.
Didn't I see you at the coffee shop?

989
01:18:36,361 --> 01:18:37,726
Yeah.

990
01:18:40,232 --> 01:18:44,066
- Is Sally here?
- Yeah. What was your name?

991
01:18:44,236 --> 01:18:45,999
I'm Todd.

992
01:18:47,305 --> 01:18:49,136
- April.
- April.

993
01:18:49,841 --> 01:18:53,504
Nice to meet you. You're a bit young
to be doing this, aren't you?

994
01:18:53,678 --> 01:18:57,478
Why would you say that?
I mean, Sally says I'm doing a great job.

995
01:18:58,817 --> 01:19:01,149
I'm just kidding with you.
I'm just...

996
01:19:02,053 --> 01:19:04,180
Todd, is it?

997
01:19:04,322 --> 01:19:06,313
- It is.
- Come back, please.

998
01:19:06,458 --> 01:19:08,187
Bye. Nice to meet you.

999
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:10,453
Very professional.

1000
01:19:11,463 --> 01:19:13,658
Very impressive.

1001
01:19:13,932 --> 01:19:16,400
I just got a call
from one of Davey's clients.

1002
01:19:16,535 --> 01:19:19,663
- Oh, good.
- He's going down.

1003
01:19:20,672 --> 01:19:23,402
Hey, what do you wanna do
with the pictures?

1004
01:19:23,575 --> 01:19:27,067
You can keep 'em.
Do what you want with them.

1005
01:19:27,212 --> 01:19:29,476
I know you're a total perv.

1006
01:19:32,818 --> 01:19:34,217
Yeah.

1007
01:19:35,687 --> 01:19:37,518
What are you looking at?

1008
01:19:38,156 --> 01:19:41,353
I was looking at April.

1009
01:19:47,632 --> 01:19:49,896
What do you think?
I love it.

1010
01:19:51,636 --> 01:19:53,627
I look like a douchebag in these clothes.

1011
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:58,840
You look great,
and you are so not a douchebag.

1012
01:19:59,578 --> 01:20:01,842
Come on, let's just go.
We're gonna be late.

1013
01:20:01,980 --> 01:20:05,848
Sammy. We're gonna go.
You look great.

1014
01:20:07,519 --> 01:20:10,181
Sabrina, don't listen to him.
We'll take it.

1015
01:20:13,158 --> 01:20:15,619
Call me tomorrow, and
we'll figure it out.

1016
01:20:15,620 --> 01:20:16,821
I gotta call you back.

1017
01:20:19,664 --> 01:20:22,497
- I thought you were sick.
- Hung over.

1018
01:20:24,636 --> 01:20:26,900
Those are the keys
to the house and the car.

1019
01:20:27,873 --> 01:20:30,740
What's happening, Nathan?

1020
01:20:30,876 --> 01:20:33,743
I'm moving back to Nebraska.

1021
01:20:33,912 --> 01:20:37,939
Nebraska?
Why would you wanna do that?

1022
01:20:38,083 --> 01:20:40,278
I'm done. I talked to my dad...

1023
01:20:40,418 --> 01:20:42,716
...and he said he'd help me
with school next semester.

1024
01:20:42,854 --> 01:20:44,845
I'm just not cut out
for Hollywood and all this.

1025
01:20:45,023 --> 01:20:46,547
You can't quit.

1026
01:20:46,691 --> 01:20:49,159
You're always one step ahead
of everybody.

1027
01:20:49,294 --> 01:20:51,819
I mean, that's why you got
April in here, isn't it?

1028
01:20:54,833 --> 01:20:56,824
Yeah, you're right.

1029
01:21:00,972 --> 01:21:04,373
You know, out of all the screwups
I've had...

1030
01:21:04,509 --> 01:21:08,673
...you had days
when you almost got everything right.

1031
01:21:09,314 --> 01:21:13,808
Well, I'd like to think that today
is one of those days. Thanks, Sally.

1032
01:21:57,629 --> 01:21:58,960
Thanks.

1033
01:22:09,441 --> 01:22:11,375
Hey.

1034
01:22:11,509 --> 01:22:13,238
Call me.

1035
01:22:25,590 --> 01:22:27,581
It's your day, big boy.

1036
01:22:27,759 --> 01:22:29,784
Second page, sign under "artist".

1037
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:50,671
I left her with you.

1038
01:22:51,416 --> 01:22:53,611
Don't fucking touch me.
Where is she?

1039
01:22:53,752 --> 01:22:55,743
I don't know.

1040
01:22:57,555 --> 01:22:59,580
What was the last time you saw her?

1041
01:23:29,854 --> 01:23:32,254
- We love these.
- Yeah, we wanna do a show.

1042
01:23:32,390 --> 01:23:34,722
We're looking for
something for this fall.

1043
01:23:36,594 --> 01:23:39,461
- What do you think?
- Yeah, okay.

1044
01:23:39,597 --> 01:23:41,588
We'll do it.
They wanna show my stuff.

1045
01:23:41,733 --> 01:23:43,724
- Really?
- Yeah.

1046
01:23:43,868 --> 01:23:45,927
- That's cool, huh?
- Yeah.

1047
01:23:50,275 --> 01:23:53,335
No, no, that one's just being leased.
Hold on.

1048
01:23:53,478 --> 01:23:57,278
Hey. Do you like that picture?

1049
01:23:59,017 --> 01:24:02,180
- Do you think I look sexy enough?
- You're a pretty sexy lady.

1050
01:24:02,353 --> 01:24:04,344
Yeah, I am.

1051
01:24:05,023 --> 01:24:08,015
Wow, that's beautiful.
Beautiful. Yes.

1052
01:24:08,159 --> 01:24:11,686
Okay, now look at me like you want me.

1053
01:24:12,697 --> 01:24:16,633
Come on, tell me that
you want me. Come on, Sally.

1054
01:24:17,168 --> 01:24:19,636
Wow, that's beautiful.
Beautiful.

1055
01:24:19,771 --> 01:24:23,070
Yes, I like the attitude.
That works. That was good.

1056
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:37,007
Hey,
you need a ride?

1057
01:24:38,723 --> 01:24:41,191
- Where you going?
- Hop in.

1058
01:24:41,793 --> 01:24:43,818
I'll take you any place you wanna go.

1059
01:24:54,472 --> 01:24:57,737
Put your seatbelt on.
You been waiting long?
