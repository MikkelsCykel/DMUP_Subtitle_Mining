<i>Hi Max.</i>

15
00:03:44,361 --> 00:03:46,874
You can let the hostages out...
He's jumped.

16
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,398
Ok. Where are you?

17
00:03:48,399 --> 00:03:50,320
In the centre,
I'll be at your place in 20 minutes.

18
00:03:50,321 --> 00:03:51,912
But it's an hour's drive?!

19
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,713
I've got a new car.

20
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,680
Where's the mask?

21
00:04:04,681 --> 00:04:06,959
What mask?

22
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,279
Balaclava.

23
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,839
Wow, are you going to wear one?

24
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,559
If I am to free the hostages,

25
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,755
I can't show them my face, now can I?
Get it?

26
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,159
Ok, guys, you're going home.

27
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,320
Do we have to go so soon?

28
00:04:41,321 --> 00:04:44,278
Move it, move it. Your father
has done you a great favour.

29
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:55,039
Man, this car is a real toy...
Can I go for a drive?

30
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,039
Sure, no problem... but we're taking yours.

31
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,839
Why are we always taking mine?
That's not fair.

32
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,718
'Cause a hole or two more in yours
won't make any difference anyway.

33
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:07,119
- You were supposed to fix that.
- The garage's been fully booked lately.

34
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,634
Welcome, gentlemen.

35
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,429
Assholes.

36
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,518
Sorry.
I just feel uneasy in tight places.

37
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,356
Next time you're taking the stairs.

38
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:28,118
Well done boys. The loo's clean.
Even smells good.

39
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,680
I've only got one observation.

40
00:07:29,681 --> 00:07:32,877
There is nothing to wipe your ass
with in cubicle two.

41
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,679
Hey, joker!
Do you know who we are?

42
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,036
We've even got a web site:
Www.gypsy.pl

43
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,080
Shut your gob.

44
00:07:40,081 --> 00:07:42,399
We are a new gang in town.

45
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,472
My name is Gypsy
and these are my men.

46
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,279
Tell your boss that from now on,
I call the shots in this area.

47
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,398
Wow, that's what you call
a well-prepared self-presentation.

48
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,674
There's one problem.
I'm the one who decides

49
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,236
where and when I make friends
and I don't usually do that in the loo

50
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,154
so get the fuck out of here!

51
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,596
We've got ourselves a bloody clown!

52
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,118
I never repeat the same thing twice.

53
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,234
Any questions, you twit?

54
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:18,960
<i>Attention passengers,</i>

55
00:08:18,961 --> 00:08:22,599
<i>we are sorry to announce that today's</i>
<i>train to Zaosie and Tomaszow Mazowiecki</i>

56
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,113
<i>has been cancelled.</i>

57
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,112
<i>We apologise</i>
<i>for any inconvenience.</i>

58
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,320
<i>I repeat:</i>

59
00:08:27,321 --> 00:08:31,119
<i>Today's train to Zaosie and</i>
<i>Tomaszow Mazowiecki has been cancelled.</i>

60
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,917
I hate public toilets.

61
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,670
Get a move on, we're already late.

62
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,593
Assholes.

63
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,599
Mister Norman!

64
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,910
- What is it?
- You've got a phone call, Mister Norman.

65
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,473
Fuck off.

66
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,638
It's the hotel. They say it's important.

67
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,552
Drives you fucking crazy.

68
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,116
Bring it on!

69
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,879
- Is there anything else?
- That's all.

70
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,233
Screw off then.

71
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,115
What do you want?

72
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,390
- I think you should come here.
- I will. And I'll kick your ass.

73
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,320
The thing is... it's about your men.

74
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,756
Right now my men
<i>should be in your hotel.</i>

75
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,799
Technically speaking... they are.

76
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,640
<i>Well... if they are, that means that</i>
they have some important errands to run.

77
00:09:54,641 --> 00:09:58,239
And you have to do what you're told to.
And if you disturb them in any way...

78
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,151
That's what I was going to tell you.

79
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,400
What the fuck
were you going to tell me?

80
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:05,039
They have already... been disturbed.

81
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,029
Have you been drinking?

82
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,512
If you hurry up you'll make it
before the cops get here.

83
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,510
Where?

84
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,556
Fuck!

85
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,039
Ta-dah!

86
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,599
What are you doing here?

87
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,039
Yeah, I'm happy to see you, too.

88
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,110
I've asked you a million times,
not when I'm at work.

89
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:21,119
Relax, honey.
Everybody knows we're together anyway.

90
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,635
It's no reason for you to come here. It's
going to spark off unnecessary rumours.

91
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,279
Take a chill pill, honey.

92
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,597
- Why are you here anyway?
- What do you mean?

93
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,599
I brought my son,
as you wanted me to.

94
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,799
Where is he?

95
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,080
He's in your office.
Don't be too hard on him, will you?

96
00:11:36,081 --> 00:11:37,759
He's sort of sensitive by nature.

97
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,319
Not too hard? Not too hard?

98
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,992
You want him
to be a good cop or not?

99
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,550
He's my only son!

100
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,999
OK, OK. But you have to go now.

101
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,599
Pop in tonight, will you?

102
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,999
- I can't.
- Why not?

103
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,438
I promised my wife
we'd go out somewhere together.

104
00:11:52,439 --> 00:11:54,800
- What, again? This miserable old cow!
- Stop it.

105
00:11:54,801 --> 00:11:58,999
- If you promise you'll give me a call...
- Well... I will.

106
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,753
- I'll be waiting. Bye, honey.
- Bye.

107
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,679
Goodbye, ma'm.

108
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,875
Bye!

109
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,520
Stand to attention!

110
00:12:24,521 --> 00:12:27,319
Sir, my name is Malinowski
and I'm in the rank of...

111
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,517
Shut your gob!
You only speak when I let you.

112
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,879
How come a beautiful woman
like your mother had YOU?

113
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,916
By the way,
who was your father?

114
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,079
Dad left us on the day I was born.

115
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,991
As soon as he saw you, I bet.

116
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,036
If it wasn't for your mother...

117
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,511
...you'd be a bobby on the beat
till the end of your life.

118
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,720
Have you filled in the application?

119
00:12:52,721 --> 00:12:55,799
I've taken the liberty of putting my CV
and the application on your desk, Sir.

120
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,199
Taken the liberty?

121
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,878
Fuck,
what sort of language is this?

122
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:01,360
Do you think you are in for
a Sunday school session?

123
00:13:01,361 --> 00:13:05,759
This is the big bad world. There's no
time for smooth talking. Understood?

124
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,476
Yes, sir!

125
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:07,631
Ok.

126
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,595
From what I can see in the papers you're
not the sharpest tool in the box.

127
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,748
But with me, you'll be making strides.

128
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,479
The first lesson, Malinowski,
is the following. Listen carefully.

129
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:28,157
If you want to teach someone to swim,
you throw him in at the deep end.

130
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,435
But I can swim.

131
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,839
It was a metaphor
to help you understand.

132
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:39,999
What I mean is that if you want
to amount to something in this job,

133
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,159
you need to start
with a serious investigation.

134
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,196
That's why
you'll be working with me.

135
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:51,798
Murders. Bank robberies. Muggings.
Are you ready for it, Malinowski?

136
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,639
I am, sir.

137
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:59,159
I promised your mother that
I'd make a man out of you.

138
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:03,119
And I do keep my word,
so if you blow it...

139
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,479
...I'll make your time difficult,
understood?

140
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,515
Yes, sir.

141
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:10,950
Come in.

142
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,438
Excuse me, Superintendent...

143
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,350
Get to the point.

144
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,439
There's been trouble at the hotel.

145
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,068
- Any corpses?
- Four.

146
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,556
This is what I had in mind.

147
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,274
Where?

148
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,479
Can you see what I see, Malinowski?
Are you paying attention?

149
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,150
I am, sir.

150
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,071
What would you call
what you see here?

151
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,553
Fucking Armageddon, sir.

152
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,598
I can see you're getting more
matter-of-fact.

153
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,272
At last something has come up

154
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,669
to liven up this bloody dull weekend.

155
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,115
- What the hell is this?
- Handcuffs. At least they used to be.

156
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,634
Makes you wonder
what they were cuffed to, doesn't it?

157
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,399
- Well, what on Earth has happened
here? - I know as much as you.

158
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,238
- Don't feed me lines.
- I'm not feeding you lines.

159
00:15:25,239 --> 00:15:28,198
What I know is that Norman has been
doing his dirty business in your hotel.

160
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,079
I had nothing to do with it.

161
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,991
But you could...
am I making myself clear?

162
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,349
One of those four suckers
was carrying something, wasn't he?

163
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,958
Oh, I'm so sorry...
It slipped my mind completely...

164
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,753
What was it?

165
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,356
When they were going in one of them
seemed to be carrying a suitcase...

166
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,912
Well, well... a suitcase.

167
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:54,594
I can see two options: Drugs or fake
dough. Malinowski, what do you reckon?

168
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,753
I think it was dough, sir.

169
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,428
If that's what you think...
it must have been drugs.

170
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,951
- Don't tell me it is him
we are going to. - We are.

171
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:26,199
Fuck you, Gula. Is this supposed
to be the guy who's got our gats?

172
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,520
He's a fucking twat and piss-head.
You can't rely on him.

173
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:31,796
Borys's turned over a new leaf.
He only drinks still mineral water now.

174
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,551
For hangover?

175
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,679
Listen, Gula. We have to get the money
from four fucking Russian thugs, today.

176
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,558
And they won't be happy
to give it to us.

177
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:39,879
- Have you thought about it?
- I have.

178
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,999
So how are we going to protect
ourselves? It's four against two.

179
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,558
We need choppers
to get out of there alive.

180
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:45,640
Stop bitching out on me,
will you?

181
00:16:45,641 --> 00:16:48,559
- What you hear is not bitching, man.
- What is it then?

182
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,913
Constructive criticism.

183
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,834
- Why does Borys have this nick?
- What nick?

184
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:01,749
Motherfucker?
They say he's done his own mother.

185
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,753
What do you mean?

186
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,316
He's done her.
With a hammer.

187
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,434
Go on, man.

188
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,709
- What the hell was that?
- Otherwise he won't open up.

189
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,309
- One more time.
- Wait, let me do it.

190
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,551
What the fuck!!!
Get the fuck out of here!

191
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,676
Borys, it's us. Gula and Max.

192
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,758
How am I supposed
to know it's you?

193
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,354
Look through the peephole
you idiot!

194
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,755
I can't see a fuckin' thing.
Move away from the door.

195
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,752
You're sure you're alone?

196
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,749
No, there's Santa here too, but he got
wasted and fell asleep in the sledge.

197
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,555
Really?

198
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,678
For fucks sake, man, open the door.
We're sort of in a hurry.

199
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,233
Paradoxically... I've been
waiting for you.

200
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,119
I've heard
you've given up the booze?

201
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,679
I have. But you know what it's like,
dudes.

202
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,438
A mate from the army
popped in and...

203
00:18:32,439 --> 00:18:34,158
- Have you been in the army?
- No. Why?

204
00:18:34,159 --> 00:18:36,037
- So where is he?
- He's having a rest.

205
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,957
Find yourselves somewhere to sit,
will you.

206
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,315
Right.

207
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,118
What brings you here?

208
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,799
We had a contract, remember?

209
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,870
Ehm... what kind of contract?

210
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:00,068
You were supposed to do us... a favour.
We've come to collect it.

211
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,278
Right... collect what?

212
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,960
Has your last grey cell evaporated?

213
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,952
Guns, damn it Borys, guns!

214
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,756
Guns! Why didn't you just
say so to start with?

215
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,593
It just... slipped my mind.
Paradoxically.

216
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:21,316
I'll get it for you.
Give me a moment.

217
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,630
I hope you're not angry
about the door scene.

218
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:39,191
I just need to double check
who's hanging round here these days.

219
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,999
Take yesterday.
These four funny guys looking like...

220
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,719
- Gypsies?
- How come You know?

221
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,798
I'll tell you some other time.

222
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,711
They said they wanted
to buy a piece.

223
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,313
Don't tell me
you actually sold them one?

224
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:58,031
I don't trade with just anybody.
I sold those suckers a dud.

225
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,272
A precise copy of Magnum 500,
half an inch caliber...

226
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,749
the biggest there is.

227
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:09,270
Might rip off your arm
if you try to shoot it.

228
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,034
Are you sure you've actually got guns?
Or was it just in your head?

229
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:23,277
One moment... I'm not quite sure...
where I've put it.

230
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,751
Guys! I love you...

231
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,391
We'll need help for this job.

232
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,351
- No! Not this gobshite!
- We have to. We're taking Johnny.

233
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,080
- I hate this fag.
- You and I both then.

234
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:01,598
Hello...

235
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:16,554
Oh, I forgot to tell you.
I picked up a new bird.

236
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,035
Pop in and meet her.
I'm telling you Max...

237
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,556
...the chick's hot.
Can't pull my dick out.

238
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,839
Has she got... a name?

239
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,479
I call her Chick. But I'm working on
a new nickname.

240
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,711
You have to call everyone names,
don't you?

241
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,677
Ok, I'll tell you,
but keep it to yourself.

242
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,237
I call her Chick cause I'm not so
found of her real name... Zofia!

243
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,233
- Zofia?
- I told you!

244
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,358
She was an unwanted child and her parents
gave her this name that to spite her.

245
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,120
She ran away from home...

246
00:21:44,121 --> 00:21:47,396
cause her stepfather started
flinging at her. Pathetic prick.

247
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,157
- Hey...
- Hey.

248
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:59,478
Isn't that a bit too scanty?
Put something on.

249
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,999
And? Isn't she hot?

250
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,118
She looks even better
when she tries a little harder.

251
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:06,838
- How old is she?
- She's old enough.

252
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,399
If she's a minor, she's illegal.

253
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,949
This whole country's illegal.

254
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,958
You've already been up shit creek once,
because of this fifteen-year-old...

255
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,992
- She looked twenty.
- Right.

256
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,391
How was I supposed to know that
her old man was a cop?

257
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,272
- But this one's... OK.
- OK?

258
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,353
- OK, OK?
- OK.

259
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,509
Hey...

260
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,278
Well, I'd like you two to meet.
This is my friend Max.

261
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,557
Hey.

262
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,799
Hello.

263
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,999
Ta-dah!

264
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,275
Hello! Elvis's come to town!

265
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,679
- Lord, I must be hallucinating.
- Are you fuckin' nuts? You look...

266
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,193
Bitchin' awesome!

267
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:12,519
I don't know
what your plans are but...

268
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:16,752
I'm gonna mop the floor with
those fuckin' Russians tonight!

269
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:23,116
Got it from my old man.
Awe-inspiring, don't you think?

270
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,359
Made my willie shrink with terror.

271
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,558
I don't know what the Boss told you,

272
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,398
but there's no way you're going
with us like this. Is that clear?

273
00:23:28,399 --> 00:23:30,878
When those Russians see
two grumpy tuxedos like you

274
00:23:30,879 --> 00:23:32,600
they'll dig up what's going on
in no time! And me?

275
00:23:32,601 --> 00:23:36,673
Ain't I grand?
That's what chill out means.

276
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:42,553
I'll pull the wool, and then... bang!
Get the piece out and...

277
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,755
Read my mouth.
There'll be no floor mopping.

278
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,470
- Max, say yes!
- Cut it!

279
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,557
Gula, do something
or I'm gonna have a fit.

280
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,553
No... no, no, no.

281
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,558
Same here.

282
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,391
Thanks.

283
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,193
Have you known each other long?

284
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,628
Ever since I remember.

285
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:30,799
Sounds like a long time, then.
I've known him for two weeks.

286
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,712
- I ran away from home, you know?
- Really?

287
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,313
My old man was pissing me off.

288
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,630
How do you like it?

289
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,552
I liked it more before.

290
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:17,190
I want you to hang around here a little
and keep your eyes peeled.

291
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,116
There's only one number
on contact list, mine.

292
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,034
Use it as a last resort thing, ok?

293
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,799
Why won't you tell Gula to stand
guard... I want to go with you.

294
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,710
Not this time, man.

295
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,119
It's never the right time.

296
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:35,317
How am I supposed to learn to be a gangster
if I never even get out of the car?

297
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,833
Scratch my car and you're dead.

298
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,760
I hope they scratch you out there.

299
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,238
There'll come a time when I get to
kill this poof with my bare hands.

300
00:25:46,239 --> 00:25:47,638
Stay centered on
what we're doing here.

301
00:25:47,639 --> 00:25:49,960
What do we do
if things start getting out of hand?

302
00:25:49,961 --> 00:25:52,315
We'll do what we always do.
Play it by ear.

303
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,119
The last time
you played it by ear,

304
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,159
I had to take
a bullet out of your ass.

305
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:00,470
And trust me, your ass is not a pleasant
view. It's still giving me nightmares.

306
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,197
- Interesting. Have you consulted
a dream-book? - Focus, man.

307
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,674
We must be back before it burns down
to the filter line.

308
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,273
Or else we get our fingers burnt.

309
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,319
You always say this before a job.

310
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,118
But when we're in,
it's you and your big mouth!

311
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:02,353
Sasha, the Poles are here.

312
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,551
Welcome. How is it going?

313
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,109
Vodka?
Good Russian moonshine.

314
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,272
It clearly is Russian.

315
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,552
But we'll be speaking Polish.

316
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,479
Polish manners...

317
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:48,994
Hey, you, sit down and drink with us.
Is he always so serious?

318
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,828
Only today.

319
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,236
So, how do you like the house?

320
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:59,873
Not really.
We'd better talk about money.

321
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:05,154
- We've got the money.
- If so, I'd like to see it.

322
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,630
Fetch me the bag.

323
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:18,436
- Is everything ok?
- You were late.

324
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,228
- A wee bit.
- A wee bit. Two weeks.

325
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,079
And so what?

326
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,593
- Do you ever plan anything up front?
- Sorry?

327
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,831
Do you ever plan
what you do up front?

328
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,678
Just like everybody else.

329
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,953
You see... the thing is, we always
have a very precise plan.

330
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,872
Now according to this plan the money was
supposed to be invested two weeks ago.

331
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:42,879
And by now the amount
would have doubled.

332
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,111
The people we were to do business
with couldn't wait for so long.

333
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,159
I don't know what it's like
where you come from, but here...

334
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,515
we expect punctuality.

335
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,394
Get it?

336
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:58,113
If you're not happy,
get the bag and get out!

337
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,358
From what I've heard it takes
some effort to find a new supplier.

338
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,239
And you wouldn't be saying this

339
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:06,232
unless you have already made
a deal with someone else.

340
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,795
Do you know what I think?

341
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,879
I think the money here
is only a bait.

342
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:21,555
And you'll put a bullet in my
brain as soon as I turn around.

343
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,350
Let's take it easy, shall we?

344
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:34,915
I've done some talking here and
there but it was only... consulting.

345
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:40,190
I'm sure we can work it out somehow,
can't we?

346
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:41,956
What's up?

347
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:47,394
Guys, are you done yet?
I'm bored out of my skull.

348
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,954
You're not going to kill Johnny.
I will.

349
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,428
Are you alright?

350
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:29,433
Johnny, why didn't you tell me anything?
It's time to brag a little bit.

351
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,153
Brag about what?

352
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,274
Picking the hottest hunk in town.

353
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,759
What do you know about
a true male friendship?

354
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,716
So that's what it's called
these days, huh?

355
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,958
I didn't know that every time
I was banging a chick

356
00:33:42,959 --> 00:33:44,240
I was actually... making friends.

357
00:33:44,241 --> 00:33:45,434
You oaf.

358
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:49,119
My new boyfriend
is a very special man.

359
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,554
He's so sweet and understanding...

360
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,392
...and his ass smells of violets!

361
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,389
Look who's talking!
Our girl-lover.

362
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,239
And you guys, when it's over,
when you're getting out of bed...

363
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,232
...do you talk of art
and the meaning of life?

364
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,795
You're getting on my nerves.

365
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:12,196
I think the most exciting thing
about a woman is her brains.

366
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,829
Shagging a bimbo
is like jerking off.

367
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,439
How do you know?

368
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,559
Not only is she thick
but apparently blind, too.

369
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,519
I wonder what she sees in you.

370
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,439
Even...

371
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:27,559
if I was a desperate whore without a penny,
I would never shag with you.

372
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,629
Ditto.

373
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:34,916
Speaking of which, I've been wondering,
what is it like between you fags?

374
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,591
I mean two guys together,
how does it work technically?

375
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,913
Do you mean sex?

376
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,310
For lack of a better word.

377
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:48,794
The name's irrelevant.
When I'm with my partner...

378
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,799
...or, technically speaking,

379
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,314
when my partner is in me, 'cause
I guess that's what you want to know...

380
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:57,719
I'm trying not to think
about the discomfort

381
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:01,079
but focus on how beautiful it is
to give something to a loved person...

382
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:05,232
And that, naturally, at some point
we'll get to swap roles.

383
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:11,629
Jesus... thank God there's no such
issue with women.

384
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,719
Well, it depends.

385
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,475
Huh? On what?

386
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:21,793
You may come across one
who will stick a dildo up your ass.

387
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,030
Wow, at last, at last!

388
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,838
Seriously.
I know one who would.

389
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,999
She won't shag with you
unless you do it for her.

390
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,038
Everybody knows you've got
a whole lot of inspiring friends.

391
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:34,393
I guess. After all, I know you.

392
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:47,109
So did you... sleep with her?

393
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,232
Only once.

394
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:56,599
Damn! This bloody dildo was the size
of a baguette. Anyway, it felt like that.

395
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,039
I'll be stuffed!

396
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,719
A guy who calls himself a gangster
had a fake shlong up his butt.

397
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:04,315
- When send word to the boys...
- Say a word and you're dead, man.

398
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,680
I know now why you're so curious
to learn more about anal sex.

399
00:36:06,681 --> 00:36:09,799
It was just this one time. I was young.
It was the experimenting stage.

400
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,360
Clearly the experience
has left lasting trauma...

401
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,953
There's only one perv among us!

402
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:16,958
There are more and more queers
and you can't do anything about it.

403
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,270
- There'll be one less when I bust you.
- Go fuck your new girlfriend...

404
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,429
- Stop it!
- Crypto gay!

405
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,350
- Stop it!
- Faggot!

406
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,790
- I won't take it anymore.
- I said stop it!

407
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,835
I'm going to the loo...

408
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:41,917
Hey, did you have a good look
at his new lady? I mean her mouth?

409
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:46,068
- Her lips are full.
- Full?

410
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,954
Critical for a good blow job, man.
Trust me. I know what I'm saying.

411
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,678
I'm sure you do.

412
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:54,795
And her feet?
Have you seen her feet?

413
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,709
- I can see you did have a good look.
- They're gigantic, man.

414
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,280
I'd never seen anything like that.

415
00:36:59,281 --> 00:37:02,559
I was even going
to borrow her shoes, but I'd drown.

416
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,151
Zip it.

417
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,999
With these feet, she could squeeze
cabbage juice in two barrels at once.

418
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,276
- You'd better shut up when
he's around, OK? - OK.

419
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,919
Max... uh,

420
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:20,357
have you heard that someone managed
to capture Yeti, the Bigfoot, on film.

421
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,710
You know, half man, half bear, living up
in the mountains.

422
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,719
Come on, Bigfoot's a myth.

423
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:33,238
I wouldn't be so sure.
Max, what do you reckon?

424
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:39,512
Hey, this isn't fair. You can't blame her
for having big feet.

425
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,910
Please, it's not mine either, is it now?

426
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:45,755
Ok, fine! You come out on top!
I almost forgot about her huge feet.

427
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:49,159
God, how can you be living
under the same roof pretending

428
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,958
that everything's fine when it's not?

429
00:37:50,959 --> 00:37:52,480
Say one more thing
about her feet and...

430
00:37:52,481 --> 00:37:55,759
I wouldn't be able to get over the thought
of this minor imperfection.

431
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,759
Shut up.

432
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:00,230
She's like an expensive sports car...
with bird crap on the windscreen!

433
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,391
I don't want to see the two of you
together ever again!

434
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,157
Take a taxi.

435
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,639
Why is it always me
who gets back by taxi?

436
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,755
Naff off man!

437
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:14,673
Ok. I'm getting the fuck out of here.
See you later, Max.

438
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:19,552
And piss on you, Gula.

439
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,830
Get in the car.

440
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,440
Now by the very fact
of being in this job

441
00:38:30,441 --> 00:38:33,919
we often face the necessity
of contacting a specific social class

442
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,434
called berks, airheads, boobies...

443
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:40,235
and generally people less intelligent
than a dog...

444
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,992
I mean a dafter breed,
like a Doberman.

445
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:47,080
Here's a typical representative
of this group.

446
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:50,479
Now, hypothetically, let's assume we're
in the following operational situation.

447
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,879
This is your suspect and you're
carrying out the interrogation.

448
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:56,110
You want to get him to talk.

449
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,952
What would you do?

450
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,749
What do I want to know?

451
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:04,349
Nevermind... say, what time it is.
Oh, right, I see...

452
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,238
Excuse me,
have you got the time?

453
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,670
Go on, go on!

454
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:15,920
Tell me what time it is, smeghead,
or I'll kick your ass.

455
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,309
Act this lively and they'll
take away your sick benefit, son.

456
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:22,836
What's wrong with you, Malinowski?
He's even still got his cap on.

457
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,549
My mother-in-law is breezier than this,
and she's in a wheelchair.

458
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,755
It's us or them, Malinowski.

459
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,953
If you're not tough
they'll eat you alive.

460
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,070
Here, let me show you
how to do this properly.

461
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:58,797
The time, retard, tell me the time
or I'll bite your head off!

462
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:04,874
The time...
Get it, you son-of-a-bitch?

463
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:15,875
Like a fat cock bursting the cherry,
Malinowski. Knock him out.

464
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,999
Are you with me?

465
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,069
I get it.

466
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:25,036
If you ask a question in this way,
you're bound to receive an answer.

467
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,751
Unless the guy has lost his watch.

468
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,878
Yes, I can see your point.

469
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,118
Come on in, boys
please, take your seats.

470
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,199
Would you like some snacks?

471
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:47,239
How about a fresh, home-made
bread roll? They're excellent.

472
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,390
- We've just eaten.
- I'll have one.

473
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,839
I always pig out
when I have a shitty day.

474
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,876
And I don't give a damn
about putting on weight.

475
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,555
Quite right, boss.

476
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,799
So, tell me, how did it go?

477
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,870
They weren't too eager
to give the money back.

478
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,837
I hope they were the first
to start shooting.

479
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,309
Uhm uhm.

480
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:20,349
Look, boss, they wanted to fuck with us.
There was no other way.

481
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,835
Norman?

482
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,595
He'd made a deal with them.

483
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,553
This bandit is getting cheeky!

484
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:42,551
And what about Johnny?
Is he a no-hoper?

485
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:47,111
He was standing guard.

486
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,670
Will he amount to something
in this business?

487
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,311
He's got a lot of enthusiasm.

488
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,799
Fuck! I can't stand it!

489
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,159
Why is this
happening to me?

490
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:05,159
My own son being a... a...

491
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,912
...queer?
- Queer!

492
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:12,558
If he wasn't my son I'd personally
break his fuckin' neck long ago.

493
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,430
Shut the fuck up!

494
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,794
But tha'is just a side plot,
let's get back to the point.

495
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,040
There's a new door-to-door salesman
in town

496
00:42:29,041 --> 00:42:33,279
who offers to sell loads of smack
at a very good price.

497
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,599
Who is it?

498
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:42,072
It's a woman.

499
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:51,160
Max! Max, wake up.

500
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:57,319
I've arranged for an appointment
in our office tomorrow.

501
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:59,640
You're going to buy
half a kilo to test it first.

502
00:42:59,641 --> 00:43:02,552
Play for time if you can but
don't scare her away.

503
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:07,399
If everything goes smoothly we'll
close the deal in a few days' time.

504
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,197
Here's the money.

505
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,113
No, gentlemen,
you've got it all wrong!

506
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:34,311
I wish I'd been born thirty years earlier.
But what's gone is gone, damn it.

507
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:41,359
Now... where were we?

508
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:43,874
Right, I was saying how much
I hated to use names...

509
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:48,273
since it may lead you to get too
friendly with the customer.

510
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,319
But since I have to communicate
with you somehow

511
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:53,629
I'm gonna give you numbers.

512
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:58,240
Now note that the numbers
are related to your assignments,

513
00:43:58,241 --> 00:44:00,549
so there's no chance of swapping.

514
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,718
Were you going to say something?

515
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,359
Now I'll take this tape off
but you have to be quiet.

516
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:43,635
My mum lives upstairs
and she really hates noise.

517
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,278
- Give me another chance.
- Are you going to give the money back?

518
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:53,632
That's not what I meant.
Let's make a deal.

519
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,037
What do you think? Should I
'make a deal' with him?

520
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,999
Ok, here's what we'll do.
I count to three.

521
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,754
If you can get a million bucks to jump
out of your ass, you're free to go.

522
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:15,599
Now if I was to squeeze
a million bucks out of mine,

523
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:20,720
I'd try real hard... so you'd better do
your best 'cause you'll only have one go.

524
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:29,993
Are you centered? Focused? Fine.
Ready, steady, go! One... Two... Three!!!

525
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,072
One!

526
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:41,232
Taking into account the case of number one,
does anyone else want another chance?

527
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:50,998
What's up?

528
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:06,951
- What is it? You're making my clients
suspicious... - You have to help me. Now.

529
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:09,279
'Have to'? 'Now'? Really?

530
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,077
Stefan, fuck,
they've gunned down my men!

531
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:15,797
Seems like you'd pissed someone off.
What have you done?

532
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,400
I have no time for bullshit.

533
00:46:17,401 --> 00:46:20,679
I need to get the product back
before it gets on the market.

534
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:23,638
- And you're gonna help me do it.
- Why would I help you?

535
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,639
Cause you're one greedy bastard,
and I pay well.

536
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:27,675
What's it gonna be then?

537
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,111
I want 20%.

538
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,239
Stefan, damn it,
nobody pays that much.

539
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:36,760
It's gonna make you
the first one ever, isn't it?

540
00:46:36,761 --> 00:46:39,194
20%.
Not a bloody penny less.

541
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,834
You wouldn't do that
if I wasn't in a deadlock.

542
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:45,594
In this industry,
everyone's in a deadlock.

543
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:49,911
I'll give you 10%.

544
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:51,119
15%.

545
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:53,429
And you don't interfere
with my sidelines. Deal?

546
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,911
Deal. But you're starting now.

547
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:00,960
If this shit is no good...

548
00:47:00,961 --> 00:47:03,713
You'll be coming back for more.
You can thank me later.

549
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,877
Hey, Baldy,
someone wants to see you.

550
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,310
Baldy, get in the car!

551
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:14,797
- I'm outta here.
- Me, too. See ya.

552
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:20,191
Don't even think about it.

553
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:30,195
Why don't they
ever listen to me?

554
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:57,837
For fucks sake, Baldy,
I'm gonna get you anyway...

555
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:16,556
I was in a good mood.
And you've ruined everything.

556
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:22,958
Do you like my shoes? Ace, huh?
I think you should have a closer look.

557
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:26,279
They look awesome
but are fuckin' of tight.

558
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:28,879
If I had wanted to go jogging,
I'd have put on sneakers.

559
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:31,110
- Fuck off!
- Why did you make a bolt for it anyway?

560
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:34,835
I owe money, I run.
I thought you were here to do me in.

561
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,959
Do you, you plank?
You're a bloody retailer.

562
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:40,513
What the fuck do you want then?

563
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:44,674
Mind your manners!

564
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,559
What can I do for you?

565
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:49,472
I'm looking for merchandise,
and I need some advice.

566
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:50,515
I know nothing.

567
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:52,078
In a second
I'm gonna shit down your lungs

568
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:54,116
and you'll have bad breath
till the end of your life.

569
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:57,476
- But I might find out.
- Now, that's better.

570
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:04,714
Take my advice. Don't play the giddy goat.
Get in the car. Slowly.

571
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:09,192
My corn hurts.

572
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:13,359
I'm gonna wait one more minute.

573
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:16,875
If your buddy doesn't call,
we're going to the garage.

574
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,560
What the fuck is this?

575
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:23,074
- I got a text message.
- Where d'you get such ringtone from?

576
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:27,472
- From the web.
- Don't be such a whiz.

577
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:29,520
That's the contact for the bloke
you're looking for.

578
00:49:29,521 --> 00:49:32,079
This much I can see myself.
Are you sure it's him?

579
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:35,159
This guy's tipped everybody off that
he was expecting a shed-load of drugs.

580
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:37,078
He's already got a line of
dealers waiting.

581
00:49:37,079 --> 00:49:37,910
No kidding!

582
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,115
That's what the boys say.

583
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:44,069
They'd better be right or else
I stomp a mug hole in your ass.

584
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,519
Can I go now?

585
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:49,239
Baldy's done his job,
Baldy's free to do a bunk!

586
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,593
- Can I have my phone?
- You can get smacked in the jaw.

587
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:00,840
Listen carefully.

588
00:50:00,841 --> 00:50:04,199
There's been some talk that there's
a 'big deal' coming up in town.

589
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,919
Big deal, like in the movies.

590
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,480
What's a 'big deal', boss?

591
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:12,599
Thick as two short planks.
You don't know what 'big deal' is?

592
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:16,350
You want me to tell you
what 'big deal' is?

593
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:21,396
You don't know what 'big deal' is?

594
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:25,998
'Big deal' is...
tell the man what it means.

595
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:30,719
In American English,
it means 'an important transaction'.

596
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:33,999
Big deal.
Trans-action.

597
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,035
Precisely.

598
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:39,199
We just have to find out
where and when.

599
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,919
And then we can get both drugs
and beans in one go.

600
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:43,872
I've got everything planned.

601
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,999
And if you screw up
like you did last time...

602
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:51,152
Boss, it was you
who screwed up the last time...

603
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:53,796
And the one the time before...

604
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:57,157
Oh! But it's gonna be different
this time, right?

605
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:59,279
And you know why?

606
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,430
Because this time
we're going the whole hog!

607
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:06,355
If anyone kicks up, bang!
Bullet in the head.

608
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:10,274
That's what I've got myself
a piece for, right?

609
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:28,748
There!

610
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,599
What is this?

611
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:31,874
It's a car.

612
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:36,069
It's a piece of crap.
You were supposed to get me a CAR.

613
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,514
There only was this so I took it.

614
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:43,593
Where did you get it from?
A special offer at the junkyard?

615
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:46,279
I borrowed it from my brother.

616
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:49,477
Boss, we'd better take this
one than hoof it.

617
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:51,158
Amen to that.

618
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:53,551
Who the fuck do I have to work with?

619
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:55,918
Get in the car!

620
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:22,155
Leave the bottle.

621
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:25,279
Don't get me wrong, but...

622
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:27,839
you've been coming here too often
and drinking too much.

623
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:29,751
Would you like to talk about it?

624
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:33,037
I miss her too, she was like a daughter
to me, you know that...

625
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:35,276
I know what you're going to say
and I appreciate it.

626
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:37,472
But it's none of your business.

627
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:50,320
You've got a very dynamic drive style.

628
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:56,912
Deep down we're all road hogs, man.

629
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:06,754
Don't step on it any harder
or we might travel in time.

630
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:11,110
Stop the fuckin' car!

631
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:15,270
Not right in the middle
of the fuckin' road!

632
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:18,830
Go back and park behind
that Mercedes, I know this car.

633
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:23,755
I'm picking up some
good vibes, gentlemen.

634
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,799
Look what you've done, you twit.

635
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:28,314
- What I've done?!
- Yes, you, you airhead.

636
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:45,269
You seem to be having
shitty day, amigo!

637
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,279
Do you always
make an entrance like this?

638
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:54,035
What, you're not scared?
If I were you I'd shit myself.

639
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:59,279
First you break my friend's furniture,
and then you threaten me with a gun.

640
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:02,590
It makes me annoyed, not scared.

641
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:05,629
What the hell???

642
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:09,639
But sometimes annoyance
may turn into rage.

643
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:15,033
I wouldn't like so I suggest you
pay for the damage and leave.

644
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:18,279
Are you fuckin' blind man?
Can't you see I've got a piece?

645
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:20,157
- Gentlemen, please...
- You stay out of it.

646
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:23,919
There's talk of a 'big deal' in town.

647
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:29,517
Tell me what you know or...
you'll have an extra hole in your head.

648
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:35,474
- Are you sure you know how to use it?
- What kind of question is this?

649
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:39,435
Prove it.

650
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:41,919
Can you see this teapot?

651
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:47,152
I'll bet you can't hit it
from a distance of one meter.

652
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:56,315
Bets must be your weakness, man.
One meter...

653
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:07,119
And... what if I win?

654
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:09,953
I'll tell you all I know
about the big deal.

655
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:17,958
I must ask out of curiosity,
what happens if...

656
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:21,351
...you don't hit the target?
- Let's assume that.

657
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:25,952
You'll have to apologise to my friend,
pay for the damage and leave politely.

658
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:29,675
You see, boys, that's what
hitting the right tone is all about.

659
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:21,479
Will you be all right?

660
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:27,677
Fair enough.

661
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:54,079
- Who the hell are you?
- An oversized dwarf.

662
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:55,559
No doubts about that.

663
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:22,199
Stop!

664
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:28,430
He's too high.

665
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:46,669
Stop!

666
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:52,999
A word of advice. Don't act a hero,
just start talking.

667
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:57,312
Sooner or later I'll make you squeal.

668
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:00,198
I'll turn your arse into
a still nature painting.

669
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:09,110
This toy has five gears and that was the
low one. Start singing before I change up.

670
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:12,359
I'll make you die a painful death.

671
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,999
One gear up
and we're having a ball already.

672
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,399
I can see you want
to make it to the top.

673
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:21,755
Are you gonna ask him
about the suitcase or not?

674
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,833
Stay put, you back seat driver,
will you?

675
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:33,159
I haven't got a clue
what you're talking about.

676
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:37,756
A suitcase, filled to the brim
with merchandise. Does it ring a bell?

677
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:43,275
- I haven't got it.
- I'm changing up again.

678
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:46,233
I'm going to buy it, though.

679
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:52,995
I see. Interesting.
When, where and from whom?

680
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:58,991
- I only know when. In two days.
- Where and from whom?

681
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:03,310
I don't know that.
She picks the spot.

682
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:04,910
It's a she?

683
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:11,950
Yes. She. Female gender.

684
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:16,039
Norman, you never said
you got rolled by female gender.

685
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:19,030
Shut your gob and get the job done.

686
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:24,518
- In two days, is it?
- In two days. The day after tomorrow.

687
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:27,158
In that case, I'm gonna have to ask you
to cancel all previous arrangements.

688
00:59:27,159 --> 00:59:28,878
You're spending the weekend with me.

689
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,194
What are you doing?

690
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,319
You've got to gank him.

691
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,959
Jesus. I am deeply surprised
with your ignorance.

692
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:38,000
What if he's dealing funk?

693
00:59:38,001 --> 00:59:40,560
You know best how
to make him tell the truth.

694
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:43,599
I may do, but it's sort of hard
to verify at the moment.

695
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:46,240
There's nothing else to do but wait.

696
00:59:46,241 --> 00:59:48,959
Fuck, whatever, do what you want.
What matters is the drugs.

697
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:52,270
But when it's over, you're gonna
do him or his men will go after us.

698
00:59:54,000 --> 01:00:00,519
Don't teach your dick how to suck eggs.
Now, bring him down.

699
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:14,994
Stop. Down, man. Down.

700
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:21,316
Do I have to do everything myself?
