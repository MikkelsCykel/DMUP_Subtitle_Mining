a good speaker.

he's getting a deal,

- Hello.
- All right, Mr.Stone.

776
00:55:47,710 --> 00:55:50,040
We came very close
to killing your wife,

777
00:55:50,110 --> 00:55:54,050
but she begged us repeatedly
for just one more chance.

778
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:57,050
So in the spirit of
compassion and mercy,

779
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:59,710
we decided not to kill her
just yet.

- We are, Mr.Stone.
- Then what's this phone call about?

We called to make you
an offer,

- an offer even you can't refuse.

I believe this is a joke, pal,
and you're it.

you've seen this man.

He was sighted in the area
a few weeks ago and then
again this morning.

He's psychotic, extremely

Maybe we'll just put him
in a jockstrap.

01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:58,140
Let's get the coast guard
and fish him out.

1221
01:27:01,180 --> 01:27:03,280
You can't do that!

1222
01:27:03,350 --> 01:27:05,650
That's not your money!

1223
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:09,050
That's my money!
Stop 'em!

1224
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:10,680
Aaah!

1225
01:27:32,750 --> 01:27:34,940
The bedroom killer!

1226
01:27:35,020 --> 01:27:37,680
[ Sam ]
What about the money?

1227
01:27:37,750 --> 01:27:40,980
They recovered a
few thousand dollars.
The rest washed away.

1228
01:27:41,060 --> 01:27:45,010
He said if anything
went wrong,

1229
01:27:45,090 --> 01:27:47,530
they'd kill Barbara.

1230
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:51,260
Things couldn't have gone more
wrong than this, could they?

1231
01:27:53,330 --> 01:27:56,130
That means she's dead.

1232
01:28:02,180 --> 01:28:06,880
[ Sobbing ]

1233
01:28:06,950 --> 01:28:08,640
[ Laughing ]

1234
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,120
- Mrs.Stone!
- I'll be damned!

1235
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:27,190
- Mrs.Stone?
- Yes.

1236
01:28:27,270 --> 01:28:30,100
I'm Lt.Walters.
We're glad to see you're okay.

1237
01:28:30,170 --> 01:28:32,770
I'm sorry to have to ask
you to do this right now,

1238
01:28:32,840 --> 01:28:36,470
but I'm afraid we need you
to identify the body.

1239
01:28:40,150 --> 01:28:43,050
Yes!
That's him!

1240
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:45,240
Oh, I could
never forget that face.

1241
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:47,380
What hell
he put me through.

1242
01:28:47,460 --> 01:28:49,720
- You're sure he worked alone?
- Positive.

1243
01:28:49,790 --> 01:28:54,820
- He mentioned a partner.
- He was schizophrenic.
He thought he had partners.

1244
01:28:54,900 --> 01:28:56,860
Where's Sam?

1245
01:28:56,930 --> 01:28:58,830
He's over there,
Mrs.Stone.

1246
01:28:58,900 --> 01:29:01,530
Would you excuse me
for a moment?

1247
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:03,800
I'd just like to be alone
with my husband.

1248
01:29:03,870 --> 01:29:06,400
- Certainly.
- Thank you.

1249
01:29:08,110 --> 01:29:10,700
Hello, Sam.

1250
01:29:13,910 --> 01:29:15,970
Barbara!

1251
01:29:17,550 --> 01:29:19,580
You look terrific!

1252
01:29:19,650 --> 01:29:22,320
You think so?

1253
01:29:23,960 --> 01:29:25,480
I mean,

1254
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:27,860
- you're so thin.
- Really?

1255
01:29:27,930 --> 01:29:30,950
Does it show?

1256
01:29:33,430 --> 01:29:37,270
I mean,
you're beautiful!

1257
01:29:37,340 --> 01:29:40,970
- Oh, Sam!
- Oh, Barbara!

1258
01:29:43,180 --> 01:29:46,310
I hope my marriage
is as strong as theirs after 15 years.

1259
01:29:46,380 --> 01:29:49,180
I can't believe
we doubted Stone's
affection for his wife.

1260
01:29:49,250 --> 01:29:52,190
- We almost blew it.
Thank God she's alive.
- [ Grunting ]

1261
01:29:52,250 --> 01:29:56,210
Ol' buddy, you work,
you put in long hours.
It's a tough beat.

1262
01:29:56,290 --> 01:29:58,880
But it all seems worth it
when you get a moment like this.

1263
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:01,050
[ Walters ]
Yeah, I love a happy ending.

1264
01:30:01,130 --> 01:30:03,430
[ Grunting ]
Barbara!

1265
01:30:03,500 --> 01:30:05,430
[ Splash ]

1266
01:31:03,290 --> 01:31:07,690
[ "Modern Woman" ]

1267
01:31:17,300 --> 01:31:19,900
You see her sittin'
with a coffee and a paper

1268
01:31:19,970 --> 01:31:23,600
With her high-top sneakers
of Italian design

1269
01:31:23,680 --> 01:31:27,240
With her long, cool stare
she aggravates attention

1270
01:31:27,310 --> 01:31:30,680
Makes up her face
while she makes up her mind

1271
01:31:30,750 --> 01:31:33,980
Now you're in trouble
maybe she's an intellectual

1272
01:31:34,050 --> 01:31:36,990
What if she figures out
you're not very smart

1273
01:31:37,060 --> 01:31:40,150
Maybe she's the quiet type
who's into heavy metal

1274
01:31:40,230 --> 01:31:44,060
You've got to get it settled
'cause she's breaking your heart

1275
01:31:44,130 --> 01:31:45,600
Don't try to
put on an act

1276
01:31:45,670 --> 01:31:50,800
You can't do that
to a modern woman

1277
01:31:50,870 --> 01:31:52,530
When you're an
old-fashioned man

1278
01:31:52,610 --> 01:31:57,480
She understands
the things you're doing

1279
01:31:57,550 --> 01:32:01,350
She's a modern woman

1280
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:08,860
She looks sleek
she seems so professional

1281
01:32:08,920 --> 01:32:12,190
She's got a lot of confidence
it's easy to see

1282
01:32:12,260 --> 01:32:15,630
You want to make a move
but you feel so inferior

1283
01:32:15,700 --> 01:32:19,260
'Cause under that exterior
is someone who's sleek

1284
01:32:19,330 --> 01:32:21,890
She's got style
she's got her own money

1285
01:32:21,970 --> 01:32:26,000
So she's not another honey
you can quickly disarm

1286
01:32:26,070 --> 01:32:29,100
She's got the eyes
that make you realize

1287
01:32:29,180 --> 01:32:32,740
She won't be hypnotized
by your usual charm

1288
01:32:32,810 --> 01:32:39,480
You've got your plan of attack
that won't attract
a modern woman

1289
01:32:39,550 --> 01:32:41,280
When you're an
old-fashioned man

1290
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:46,120
She understands
the things you're doin'

1291
01:32:46,190 --> 01:32:50,560
She's a modern woman

1292
01:32:54,440 --> 01:32:57,840
As time goes by and
you're sharing an apartment

1293
01:32:57,910 --> 01:33:00,840
She says she loves you
but she doesn't know why

1294
01:33:00,910 --> 01:33:04,170
The morning she gives you
your coffee and your paper

1295
01:33:04,250 --> 01:33:08,050
It's a strange situation
for an old-fashioned guy

1296
01:33:08,120 --> 01:33:11,310
But times have changed
things are not the same, baby

1297
01:33:11,390 --> 01:33:14,150
You won't be changed
it's your bad attitude

1298
01:33:14,220 --> 01:33:17,620
Rock'n'roll just used
to be for kicks and
nowadays it's politics

1299
01:33:17,690 --> 01:33:21,460
And after 1986
what else could be new

1300
01:33:21,530 --> 01:33:28,130
You've got to learn
to relax and face
the facts of a modern woman

1301
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:29,930
And you're an
old-fashioned man

1302
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:34,840
She understands
the things you're doin'

1303
01:33:34,910 --> 01:33:38,810
She's a modern woman

1304
01:33:41,620 --> 01:33:45,180
She's a modern woman
