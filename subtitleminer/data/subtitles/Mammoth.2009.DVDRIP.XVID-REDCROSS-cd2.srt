1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,236
I can help with the fishing nets.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:10,428
No, we can take care of it.
Perhaps when you're older...

3
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,951
Good day. I was wondering,
could I work here?

4
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,795
That's not possible.
You're too young.

5
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,509
I'm good at cooking,
I always help my grandma at home.

6
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:38,313
- It's not possible... Go away.
- I'm a fast learner.

7
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,359
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon to you.

8
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,069
I'm just wondering
if there's work for me here.

9
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,598
See this sack of rice...
It must be emptied.

10
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,629
Put this plastic bag on the scale.
You're going to repack the rice.

11
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,758
Each plastic bag should weigh 1 kilo.

12
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,278
Put the rice in the plastic bag,
like this.

13
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:12,639
Just make sure the scale needle
doesn't go past number one.

14
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:17,271
It doesn't matter if it goes
under the line, but not over.

15
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,034
Mother, I can't do this any longer.

16
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:25,149
Glorla, I know you can do lt.
You're strong.

17
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,390
I feel like my chest will explode.

18
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:33,317
Mother, I'll never get used
to this. Not ever!

19
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,631
This is not what God wants.

20
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:41,157
You feel that way now,
but I belleve It's God's wlll-

21
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,959
- that you glve your chlldren
a better future.

22
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,236
No, mother!

23
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:51,952
God wants me to be with my children.

24
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,998
Can you understand that?

25
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,435
- I want to come home.
- No...

26
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,989
I miss my children.

27
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:04,153
Be strong my chlld,
you can do lt.

28
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:11,158
Try to be strong.
I know you can do lt.

29
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,434
I'm done now.

30
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,470
- Are you finished?
- Yes.

31
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,111
- Is the sack empty?
- Yes.

32
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,319
Let me see.
You're a really good boy.

33
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:36,349
Wait, I'll go inside.
I have a reward for you.

34
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,634
Here you are...
Some candy and mango juice.

35
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,190
- That's your favourite, isn't it?
- Yes, thank you.

36
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,070
You're a really nice boy,
a hard working boy.

37
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,196
You like that, don't you?

38
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:12,950
I just wanted to ask how...

39
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,918
What?

40
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:22,792
- How much will you pay me?
- Pay you?

41
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:27,351
- I'm not giving you any money.
- But you must pay me.

42
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:31,513
- I did all of this.
- Did you help me for money?

43
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,992
Get out of here. Shame on you!
Are you trying to trick me?

44
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:42,315
Go on, leave! Shame on you!
I'm not that easily fooled!

45
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:31,030
- And no sex?
- No.

46
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,670
- Nothing?
- No.

47
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,195
- Where is he from?
- America.

48
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,351
I love Americans.

49
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,398
I hate them,
but this one was different.

50
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:48,111
- You hate Americans?
- Why?

51
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,714
They think they're so good in bed.

52
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,839
The Italians are worse.

53
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,913
Yes, they think they're so good,
they shouldn't have to pay.

54
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:05,189
- But the Germans are the worst.
- The Germans? They're OK.

55
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,989
They're dirty.

56
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,469
No, not all of them.

57
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:18,034
But the Arabs...
The Arabs are the worst of all.

58
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:23,638
- I wouldn't go with them.
- Nobody would. They stink.

59
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:28,715
How about the Japanese?
I wouldn't go with them.

60
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,190
No way, not with a Jap...
I hate the Japanese.

61
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:37,036
You wouldn't because their dicks
are the size of my little finger.

62
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,751
My little finger, not yours.

63
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,710
I'm going to look for him tomorrow.
I know where he lives.

64
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:45,550
Time to get up!
We're going somewhere today.

65
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:49,679
Hurry up and get dressed.
Wake up!

66
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:53,515
- But I have school today.
- You're not going to school.

67
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,196
I'll be your teacher today.

68
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:06,837
This is yours...
...and this is yours.

69
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,278
Tell your brother's teacher
he's home sick today.

70
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,637
So you've worked
for that old miserly cheat!

71
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,598
Rita told me everything.

72
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:28,754
- I take good care of you, don't I?
- Yes, grandmother.

73
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:34,836
So why do you keep calling
your mother to complain?

74
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,669
Do you know where we're going?

75
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,711
Let's go.

76
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,270
Look at them.

77
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:30,232
This is what they do every day.

78
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:40,954
Look at those kids.
Is this the kind of life you want?

79
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:50,796
Look, he's only your age
and he's already collecting garbage.

80
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:14,629
- Here's some bread, eat it!
- I don't want it.

81
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:18,475
Why not?
You haven't eaten anything today.

82
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,154
Go on, eat it!

83
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:25,108
Do you know why your mother
is working in America?

84
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,955
So you won't have to eat this bread.

85
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,749
So that you can have a good life.

86
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:37,835
A good life, proper food, nice house.

87
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,072
A good education.

88
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,949
Money, so when you get sick
you can go to the doctor.

89
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,829
Those kids can't go to the doctor.

90
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:56,998
When they get sick, they just die.

91
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,594
They just die.

92
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,349
Are you enjoying your ice cream?

93
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:24,036
We should pity those people
who live in the dumpsite.

94
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:28,398
No one should have to live
in a place like that.

95
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:37,430
You know, there's something worse
happening here at night.

96
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,030
Kids come here to sell themselves.

97
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:47,149
- Sell themselves?
- They sell themselves to tourists.

98
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:50,756
They buy kids and take
them to their hotels.

99
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:54,708
Why are they taking the kids
to their hotels?

100
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,112
I don't know, they just want
someone to sleep with.

101
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,118
Do they get paid?

102
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:07,319
What else do they do?

103
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:13,828
Let's not talk about it.
They just sleep, nothing else.

104
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,074
They don't do anything,
they just sleep there.

105
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,549
Just eat your ice cream.

106
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,675
Hey, that's my bike.
What are you doing with it?

107
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:39,949
- It's mine now.
- It's not yours, it's ours.

108
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:42,793
Your slippers... take them off.

109
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,430
- Take off your clothes.
- Do you have any money?

110
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,990
You're new around here,
don't be a show off!

111
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:00,469
Hey, go away!

112
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:07,149
Wake up!

113
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,550
It's time to eat soon.

114
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:18,079
- Have you seen your brother?
- No.

115
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:33,512
- Have you seen Salvador?
- No.

116
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:38,595
It's very early and he's not here.
I wonder where he is.

117
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:42,389
He's probably just hanging
out with the neighbours.

118
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:46,348
- Are you sure you haven't seen him?
- Yes.

119
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,759
- Have you seen Badong?
- No, I haven't.

120
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:23,993
He's not in his room
and his bike is missing.

121
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:27,038
Big brother!

122
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:33,473
- Miss, have you seen Badong?
- No, I haven't.

123
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:36,916
OK. Thank you.

124
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:11,713
There's a child here!
He's bleeding. Help me!

125
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:16,277
Check his pulse.

126
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:19,238
Call an ambulance.
Hurry up!

127
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:22,312
Where is he?

128
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:26,553
He's still breathing.
Help me carry him.

129
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,233
We need a tricycle!

130
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:33,311
Hello...
Gloria, is that you?

131
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:41,432
My dear daughter,
I don't know how to say this...

132
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:45,115
...but something's happened
to Salvador.

133
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:10,995
- This is a very nice pen.
- I'm not really interested in pens.

134
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:15,915
I'll give you 25 dollars for all
of these, you'll get less elsewhere.

135
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:20,517
- Only 25 dollars?
- 25, max.

136
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:23,956
I can't give you more.
This one's a copy.

137
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:29,240
Okay, I'll give you 30.
That's my last offer. Agreed?

138
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:44,237
I'm here now, my son.

139
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:48,632
I will never leave you again.

140
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:09,994
Never ever.

141
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:16,031
How are you, my sweet one?
Are you not asleep yet?

142
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:23,952
I miss you. Do you miss me?

143
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:29,478
I'll be comlng to see you soon.

144
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:32,677
I promise to come and see you.

145
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:38,951
Are you falling asleep?
Do you want me to sing you a lullaby?

146
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:45,315
Close your eyes

147
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:49,234
And have a sweet dream,
my dear child

148
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:56,795
I'll be here to protect you
and to watch over you
