00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:58,793
<i>Mr. Hauser</i>
<i>Is there something else you need?</i>

13
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:02,767
I don't know.

<i>Go on. </i>

15
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:08,880
Like a refuge from the
Island of Dr. Moreau.

16
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:13,683
Some morally inverted, twisted
character from a Celine novel.

17
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:16,054
The hot sauce helps.

<i>You still getting those nightmares</i>

They're coming back faster and faster. I
don't know if I can keep outrunning 'em.

20
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:27,196
That'll be it, Jerry.
I gotta go.

<i>Hello, Hauser!</i>

29
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:51,650
Hello, Mr. Vice President.

30
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:53,885
I haven't been vice president
for five months.

31
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,860
Otherwise, this all might
be a conflict of interest.

32
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,463
Tamerlane and the U.S. government,
and I in particular, were cleared...

33
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:03,024
<i>of any and all violations of federal,</i>
<i>state and international laws... </i>

34
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:05,038
<i>by the bipartisan committee. </i>

35
00:05:05,073 --> 00:05:06,596
Just read the report.

36
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:09,834
I'm sure anything you weren't supposed
to be doing you were cleared of.

37
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:12,810
And of course I was preemptively
pardoned by the president.

38
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:16,041
I got the snapshots.
Love your work.

39
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,640
- We're all big fans.
- Yes.

40
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:20,218
Let's see if the
damn Krauts...

41
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:22,948
will cross us in the
Security Council now.

42
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:25,386
We seem to be heading southeast.
Where am I going?

43
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,152
Hope you like the smell
of fresh liberation.

44
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:29,323
Give me a sec.

45
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:32,460
I gotta growler down there
the size of a cane frog.

46
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:37,164
Turaqistan.

47
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:38,462
What's the gig?

48
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:42,305
<i>Omar Sharif. </i>

49
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:44,037
- Omar Sharif?
<i>- Yeah. </i>

50
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:47,208
<i>The CEO of Ugi Gas, the</i>
<i>Ugikistani conglomerate. </i>

<i>He is building a pipeline</i>
<i>through his country. </i>

<i>to get hustled by a fez head. </i>

53
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:56,379
<i>Terminate. </i>

54

<i>Do do that voodoo</i>
<i>that you do so well. </i>

55
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:01,652
You'll be working directly under the
viceroy just appointed by the president.

56
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:05,253
His identity is still being withheld
on a need to know basis.

57
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:08,027
- And no one needs to know.
- He asked for you personally.

58
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:11,101
- What's my cover?
- Trade show producer.

59
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:14,628
Trade show? What show?
What show?

60
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:15,969
It's gonna be huge.

61

Tamerlane is sponsoring
a trade expo, Brand USA.

62
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:22,710
It's our big launch bringing democracy
to this part of the world.

63
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:25,918
We've bombed the shit out of them,
there's a lot of rebuilding to do.

64
00:06:25,953 --> 00:06:28,944
- Shows a nice spirit.
- Somebody has to help them.

65
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:32,957
<i>This is a great opportunity</i>
<i>for Tamerlane and the U.S.</i>

66
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:35,450
<i>Not to mention the</i>
<i>people of Turaqistan. </i>

67
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:38,964
And to top it all off, there's gonna
be a gala wedding. Isn't that great?

68
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:42,967
Seems like a pretty elaborate cover. I'm
gonna be responsible for all that shit?

69
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:44,468
This is a historic moment.

70
00:06:45,204 --> 00:06:49,766
The first war ever to be 100%
outsourced to private enterprise.

71
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:53,005
Tamerlane jets, Tamerlane
tanks, Tamerlane soldiers.

72
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:56,447
And to top it all off,
the Brand USA expo.

73
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:58,347
It's your show, baby.

74
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:56,407
Welcome to the Turaqi
Green Zone, sir.

75

<i>Tamerlane welcomes Expo</i>
<i>Turaqistan, Brand USA.</i>

76
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:44,017
Welcome to Turaqistan, sir.
I'm Marsha Dillon...

77
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,148
hoping you're
ready to kill.

78
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:46,054
I've been briefed.

79
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:49,427
SPF-Eighty-seven, sir.

80
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:51,252
- Shall we?
- Yes.

81
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:02,163
It all looks good.

82
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,009
Great lights.

<i>Take out the Tamercard. </i>

84

What's your cover, by the way?

85
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,441
Undergrad Wharton with a masters in
communication at the Annenberg School.

86
00:09:11,517 --> 00:09:12,950
- Very impressive.
- Well, it's fake.

87
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:16,986
- Tell me that's not the stage?
- I think it is.

88
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,284
East, honey, east.

89
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:21,823
Do you want people turning away from
the stage to pray five times a day?

90
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:24,362
Cultural sensitivity.
That's what we're about here.

91
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:25,863
Sorry, sir.

92
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:31,535
What exactly is wrong
with my credentials?

93
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:34,265
I've been cleared. My
colleagues are going in.

94
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,976
- Am I being singled out for some reason?
- I can't allow that.

95
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:39,477
Very curious.

96
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:42,946
- Find out who she is.
- Very curious situation.

97
00:09:43,015 --> 00:09:44,607
- Let's go, ma'am.
- Oh. Okay.

98
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,015
And set up a meeting
with her in my office.

99
00:09:49,488 --> 00:09:50,978
Do I have an office?

100
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,589
Great. Carry on.

101
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:56,059
Yes, and I'll just try to
rearrange the entire place.

102
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:57,652
- Just see if you can spin it.
- Yes.

103
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:03,601
Ms. Hegalhuzen.

104
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:12,834
Your 2:30's here.

105
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:16,747
I read your piece in
"Atlantic Monthly".

106
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,044
Very provocative.

107
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:22,079
- Nice office.
- It's bulletproof.

108
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:27,256
<i>Send her in. </i>

109
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:39,093
Passion. This

110
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:44,873
Thank you!

111
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:47,573
Hey, okay, okay,
we'll be in touch.

112
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,149
- It's a gift. I brought a gift to you.
- Thank you.

113
00:10:50,184 --> 00:10:52,117
- It's a form of dance.
- Thank you. Good stuff.

114
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:54,379
Pay-for-view TV.
Next week!

115
00:10:57,623 --> 00:10:58,869
And you are an angel.

116
00:10:58,904 --> 00:11:00,116
Thanks for the bag!

117
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:04,454
Ms. "Hugelhazen".

118
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:05,360
Hegalhuzen.

119
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:08,367
- Hegalhuzen. Brand Hauser.
- Hello.

120
00:11:08,402 --> 00:11:09,356
- Hi.
- Hey.

121
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:10,333
Come on in.

122
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:15,701
Now...

123
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:18,903
Holy shit!

124
00:11:21,313 --> 00:11:24,146
So, you're here to cover
our little trade show...

125
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:27,617
"... that's being billed as
a liberating Turaqistan...

126
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,349
satisfy the American consumer's
dreams just the opposite now.

127
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:35,052
The proposed Expo Turaqistan offers
nothing more than the auctioning of...

128
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:39,291
Turaqistan's future to the cause of
profit and international branding.

129
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:41,531
Yeah, I remember that because I wrote it.

130
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,303
There's no corruption here. Just
read the Silverman James Report.

131
00:11:44,338 --> 00:11:45,936
I have. It's bullshit.

132
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:51,043
Look. We've already kicked out of this
place. What are we supposed to do?

133
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:54,376
Turn our backs on all of the
entrepreneurial possibilities?

134
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:58,941
Business is human response
to a moral or cosmic crisis.

135
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:02,555
Whether it's a tsunami or a
sustained aerial bombardment...

136
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:04,955
there's the same urgent
call for urban renewal.

137
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:09,019
When did they start attacking
inside the Emerald City?

138
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:10,460
I wouldn't call that an attack.

139
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:15,558
Well, technically, that was a bombing.
At least it sounded like it was.

140
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:17,636
Not an attack, which would
imply something else.

141
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:20,530
Do you really think
I'm as bad as all this?

142
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:23,070
- I don't know anything about you.
- Would you like to?

143
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:24,232
It's my job.

144
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:27,074
You make it sound so
tedious. Could be fun.

145
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:29,545
- Then why don't I begin?
- Thought you'd never ask.

146
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:33,316
Would you excuse me for one minute?

147
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:41,082
- Call me soon.
- When?

148
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:42,091
You'll feel it.

149
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:45,991
- All righty then. Where were we?
- I haven't said anything yet.

150
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:47,798
Excellent, 'cause I don't
remember hearing anything.

151
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,994
- Then we're off to a great start.
- What can I do for you?

152
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:53,561
Why do I have access?
Even on such a low level.

153
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:54,999
Ouch.

154
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:59,472
All my writings have called this
a violation of international law...

155
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:01,103
and its practitioners are criminals.

156
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,582
Do you really believe
all the stuff you write?

157
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:06,378
Anyone who could cause this much
mayhem when he didn't have to?

158
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:08,743
The amount of suffering
that I've seen?

159
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:10,214
Hang on.

160
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:14,521
Okay. Hold on a sec.

161
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:16,493
But the way I look at it is this.

162
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:20,464
The day we can actually feel and
hear all the suffering of mankind...

163
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:22,728
that's the day when the
Christ will come back.

164
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:26,030
So we got that going for us.
I'll be out in a minute.

165
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:30,207
Or the Buddha, or Allah,
whoever floats your boat.

166
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:32,266
Ms. Hagenhazel.

167
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:34,278
- Call me Natalie.
- Natalie.

168
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:37,975
I really must run. I feel like we're
on the verge of something important.

169
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:42,080
Do you think we could continue
this conversation over drinks?

170
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:45,349
- Drinks?
- Yeah, I know a friendly place.

171
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,290
Marsha, will you set that up?
9, 10-ish?

Hello, sir. Welcome to Popeye's.
How can I help you?

174
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:17,483
I'll have crawfish etouffee, the Big
Flava chicken sandwich with Boss Sauce...

175
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:20,116
and to top off my meal,
a frothy orange drink.

176
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,653
- I'm here to see the viceroy.
- Sir.

177
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:26,287
Don't mention his name.
Follow me!

178
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,363
Okay!

179
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:44,316
Let's go, boys.
One, two, one, two march!

Diet Coke. You get it?

236
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,167
And pickles.

237
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:06,869
She wants pickles.
Clausen classic dill pickles.

land-grab masquerade.

267

Are you with Tamerlane employee
or a freelance producer?

268
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:39,094
That's complicated.
Let's get to that later.

269
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:41,338
I just wanted to get to know you.

270
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:45,975
Okay, tell me about yourself.

271
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:50,813
Just doing this gig, trying to
make the best of a bad situation.

272
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:53,942

273
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:55,943

274
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:56,952
How about me what?

275
00:20:57,055 --> 00:20:59,319
You know, tell me about you.
Where're you from?

276
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,886
Who gives a fuck? Are you serious?

277
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:06,024
I'm serious as a deacon. I'd like
to get to know you as a person.

278
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:09,159
For God's sakes... why?

279
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:15,601
Well, what the hell else are we gonna
do on this dark and lonely night?

280
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:20,010
So you wanna seduce the journalist
whose politics you despise?

281
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:21,739
How dare you?
I have no politics.

282
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:23,838
Everyone does, even if
they don't know it.

283
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:27,685
- Not me.
- Just a straight mercenary?

284
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,549
I'm a host. I'm a showman.
I'm an organizer.

285
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:32,923
There's just people here. Some good,
some bad. All interesting.

286
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:36,018
You seem like an interesting person and
I try not to over-think these things.

287
00:21:36,094 --> 00:21:39,791
You're a clever guy.
Some would even call you charming.

288
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:44,099
But it gets tired, doesn't it? All that
patter, the show biz, it's just a mask.

289
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,865
There's gotta be a person
in there somewhere.

290
00:21:49,574 --> 00:21:53,169
Did you know that "person" comes from
the Latin word persona which means mask?

291
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:55,938
Being human means we
invite spectators...

292
00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:57,879
to ponder what lies behind.

293
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,976
Each of us would be composed
of a variety of masks.

294
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:05,924
And if we can see behind the mask,
we would get a burst of clarity.

295
00:22:05,959 --> 00:22:09,883
If that flame was bright
enough, then we fall in love.

296
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,694
What's your opinion on
these divine matters?

297
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,227
I'm not gonna fuck you.
You know that, right?

298
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:20,901
Oh, I hope that you
know that somewhere.

299
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:23,736
I sense you're such an angry woman.

300
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:27,059
You're just intent to laying
waste to all of us, aren't you?

301
00:22:27,094 --> 00:22:30,309
That was the best half-true
frontier gibberish I've heard.

302
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:31,506
Thanks.

303
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:33,876
- Hey. Listen.
- Yes?

304
00:22:33,952 --> 00:22:36,420
All access pass to the trade show,
compliments of the house.

305
00:22:37,322 --> 00:22:39,085
- Don't be a stranger.
- I won't be.

306
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:44,893
Now, let's get these passe's right.

307
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:46,861
Ayat, a little knee jerk.

308
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:48,994
Make it work. Make it work.

309
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:50,931
Very good.

310
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:53,766
All in the legs, girls.

311
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:55,568
How many times do we have
to say this? Ayat!

312
00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:57,266
Higher!

313
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,846
Big smile, Reshbeck!
For God's sake.

314
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,047
Thank you.

315
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:07,379
You're back for some more gibberish.

316
00:23:07,452 --> 00:23:08,885
You remember Marsha?
This is Peter Parker.

317
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:12,879
Choreographer, worked with Rob
Marshall, all the big musicals.

318
00:23:12,991 --> 00:23:15,861
It's incredible. Each girl
is a trans-femoral amputee...

319
00:23:15,896 --> 00:23:17,158
who had lost her leg
during the liberation.

320
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:23,691
And thanks to Tamerlane, we can
have you up and dancing in no time.

321
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:26,033
Just another example of
how American know-how...

322
00:23:26,104 --> 00:23:27,594
alleviates the suffering it creates.

323
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:32,837
Look at this. Hamy Shenkman had her leg
blown off by an M-18 Claymore landmine.

324
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:37,949
And, Conyel Bisland...
an M-72 rocket-propelled grenade...

325
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:39,541
that mistakenly hit her high school.

326
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:42,519
And Tamerlane used the exact same RPG
firing pin rod assembly technology...

327
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:44,919
that it uses in the prosthetic
knees of its.

328
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:46,514
Talk about vertical integration.

329
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:48,286
It's hot in here.
Let me get that for ya.

330
00:23:48,393 --> 00:23:49,758
Krishmish, come over here.

331
00:23:52,063 --> 00:23:55,157
This is Ms. Hegalhuzen, she's
writing a story about the show.

332
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,529
All right. Okay.

333
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:58,330
Ms. Babyyeah's ready
for her run-through.

334
00:23:59,137 --> 00:24:00,806
We've gotta go. My trade
show's your trade show.

335
00:24:00,841 --> 00:24:02,034
Come on, girls. Gather here.

336
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:26,830
<i>You say you want to</i>
<i>invade me, baby</i>

337
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:30,723
<i>You say you want to</i>
<i>enslave me, baby</i>

338
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:35,802
<i>I want to blow you up</i>

339
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:41,612
<i>You say you want</i>
<i>to free me, baby</i>

340
00:24:42,047 --> 00:24:45,710
<i>BGut you cannot</i>
<i>even see me, baby</i>

341
00:24:47,853 --> 00:24:49,821
<i>I want to blow you up</i>

342
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:57,384
<i>I want to blow you sky</i>
<i>high, high, go fly</i>

343
00:24:59,865 --> 00:25:04,069
<i>I want to blow</i>

344
00:25:04,104 --> 00:25:04,865
<i>You</i>

345
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,175
<i>You want to occupy</i>
<i>my heart and soul</i>

346
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:14,804
<i>A black widow in</i>
<i>a spider hole</i>

347
00:25:17,415 --> 00:25:19,212
<i>I want to blow you up</i>

348
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:26,218
<i>I want to blow you up</i>

349
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:33,789
<i>I want to blow you</i>
<i>down if it's okay</i>

350
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:37,029
Mr. Hauser, how do you feel about
the image of Turaqi women...

351
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:39,462
My coat!

352
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:42,905
Cut!

353
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:53,348
So there's this reporter
who really despises me.

354
00:25:54,185 --> 00:25:57,848
I mean, she doesn't really despise me,
she despises what I represent.

355
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:03,091
I think if she knew the real me,
she'd hate me even more.

356
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:04,487
I mean, don't you think?

357
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,964
<i>I wasn't there. </i>
<i>Does it really matter?</i>

358
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:10,467
Actually, I think I just like
the sound of her voice.

359
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:13,132
I could listen to her
revile me for hours.

360
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:16,639
Do you think with her, the reporter
I mean, it's just about sex?

361
00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:19,101
<i>- What do you mean just?</i>
- I don't know.

362
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:23,840
There's this Turaqi pop star. She
disturbs me and I can't figure out why.

363
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,316
<i>Could you be attracted to her sexually?</i>

364
00:26:27,485 --> 00:26:29,316
No, are you crazy?
She's just a little...

365
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:32,049
<i>I'm not calling you in the</i>
<i>middle of the night, Mr. Hauser. </i>

366
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:34,025
- I gotta go.
<i>- Whatever. </i>

367
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,356
You're a fuckin' asshole.

368
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:36,823
<i>GuideStar!</i>

369
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:45,228
This has to end for me, sir. I
want a different kind of life.

370
00:26:46,037 --> 00:26:47,402
I want to get married, start a family.

371
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:49,973
Operation Chickenhawk
never ends.

372
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:53,035
The ceaseless epic struggle
to dominate...

373
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:56,808
the destiny of man obliges his noble
cares to continually purge the world...

374
00:26:56,881 --> 00:26:59,247
of those who are evil-doers.

375
00:26:59,317 --> 00:27:01,182
But that's not just working
for me right now, sir.

376
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:02,787
A woman?

377
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:08,085
You and I, Hauser, are
a part of a rug hook.

378
00:27:08,994 --> 00:27:13,431
All these years I felt a special
bond. Don't you feel that?

379
00:27:15,533 --> 00:27:16,090
No.

380
00:27:16,668 --> 00:27:17,760
Well, you think about it.

381
00:27:18,503 --> 00:27:20,471
If you still feel this
way in a couple of days...

382
00:27:20,538 --> 00:27:21,470
I already told you, sir.

383
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:24,168
- That'll be all.
- Yes, sir.

384
00:28:05,283 --> 00:28:06,850
Marsha, this is kind of a bad time.

385
00:28:06,885 --> 00:28:11,379
<i>Hey! I wanted to give you the heads up. </i>
<i>A delivery should be there any second. </i>

386
00:28:11,456 --> 00:28:12,354
When, now?

387
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:16,783
Oh, shit.

388
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:37,971
Sir, I have your
dry cleaning, sir!

389
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:40,340
Thank you. Thank you.

390
00:28:41,686 --> 00:28:42,744
I need the ticket, sir.

391
00:28:43,755 --> 00:28:46,246
- I have that somewhere.
- Yeah, I need that claim ticket, sir.

392
00:28:46,324 --> 00:28:50,954
I think I put it... should
be around here somewhere.

393
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:54,590
- You're talking about the claim ticket?
- It's around here somewhere.

394
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:56,827
- Sir, can you hurry?
- Yep.

395
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:58,732
Sir, I gotta have that ticket or...

396
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:02,730
No, no...

397
00:29:05,376 --> 00:29:06,365
Oh, here it is.

398
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:09,809
- Sir, you have a nice day.
- Sure.

399
00:29:12,283 --> 00:29:14,751
Yo, yo, yo, mother fuckers!

400
00:29:38,243 --> 00:29:38,800
It's me.

401
00:29:45,683 --> 00:29:46,650
- Hi.
- Hi.

402
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:50,053
Straight from the dry
in Rammstein, Germany

403
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:52,886
You can't believe these guys. 20
years ahead of the rest of the world.

404
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:55,653
And this cost the U.S. taxpayers, what?
Three, four grand?

405
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,591
Be nice.
I'm really sorry about the jacket.

406
00:29:57,695 --> 00:29:58,525
Okay.

407
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,461
Listen, would you like to get
a Turaqi coffee?

408
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:03,262
I hear they make it great here.
Cardamom mace. The good kind.

409
00:30:03,334 --> 00:30:05,029
I was just about to wash my hair.

410
00:30:05,103 --> 00:30:07,264
It's a delicacy. Sweetened
with pomegranate honey.

411
00:30:08,506 --> 00:30:09,302
One cup?

412
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:14,779
Give me a minute.

413
00:30:25,757 --> 00:30:26,314
What?

414
00:30:26,391 --> 00:30:29,360
There's just something irresistible
about a Western woman speaking Turaqi.

415
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:31,190
Is that a recognized
international phenomena?

416
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:32,991
No. It's a personal sensibility.

417
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:38,264
Look. I admit I don't actually
believe any of this stuff we say.

418
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,998
I mean, not in the sense that I
believe it to be actually true.

419
00:30:41,072 --> 00:30:44,041
You talk too much. I want
to ask you something.

420
00:30:45,043 --> 00:30:49,173
Doesn't it hurt you to put yourself
in such a contorted moral position?

421
00:30:49,247 --> 00:30:52,114
Can you tell me, for example,
one completely honest thing?

422
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:55,785
One.

423
00:31:00,925 --> 00:31:04,156
This is Donny Loo's
favorite juice.

424
00:31:04,229 --> 00:31:07,721
It is rated at just under a quarter
million Scoville units.

425
00:31:08,766 --> 00:31:11,936
When I find the demands of
life to be challenging...

426
00:31:11,971 --> 00:31:13,198
I take a wee drop.

427
00:31:14,572 --> 00:31:15,903
The more challenging...

428
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:19,475
the higher the Scoville units.

429
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:23,342
- Let me.
- Be careful.

430
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:27,250
But the trick, you see...

431
00:31:27,318 --> 00:31:29,878
that I've taught myself, is to
never allow my eyes to tear up.

432
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:38,256
One completely honest thing.

433
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:42,859
If you really knew me, you'd despise
me even more than you do.

434
00:31:42,934 --> 00:31:44,367
No. I don't despise you.

435
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:48,869
I don't really care enough.

436
00:32:16,534 --> 00:32:17,057
Marsha.

437
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:22,671
It's fucking great.
Michael Bay can blow me.

438
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:23,968
He can and he should.

439
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:26,306
- We do all of Yonica's videos.
- We're blowing up.

440
00:32:26,377 --> 00:32:27,810
A bad choice
of words.

441
00:32:27,845 --> 00:32:29,813
Listen, guys, this has been great.
Thank you.

442
00:32:29,881 --> 00:32:32,327
I have another meeting. I have to run.
But I, I really enjoyed it.

443
00:32:32,362 --> 00:32:34,774
Let us have some footage of the
wedding. We'll hook you up, dude.

444
00:32:34,852 --> 00:32:37,047
Hey, we know everything that
goes on in Turaqistan.

445
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:40,557
No place we cannot go, no one we
don't know, nothing we cannot do.

446
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:41,250
Okay.

447
00:32:41,326 --> 00:32:43,817
Does one of you have a card?
Whoever the leader is.

448
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:45,055
Here we go. The Jackpot.

449
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:46,926
Here, thank you. Thank you.

450
00:32:47,832 --> 00:32:50,767
There you go. You have his,
and he has yours.

451
00:32:50,835 --> 00:32:51,893
- Yes.
- He's got yours.

452
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,164
- It's gonna be great.
- Bye-bye, guys.

453
00:32:56,908 --> 00:32:58,569
Where's my package?

454
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:01,869
The shipment left the warehouse
in Dubai 2 days ago.

455
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:03,439
We're tracking it.

456
00:33:05,516 --> 00:33:07,484
Just get me a fuckin' cobra,
all right?

457
00:33:08,252 --> 00:33:10,243
- A snake?
- Yeah. Chop-chop.

458
00:33:18,796 --> 00:33:20,525
Come on, spit it out.

459
00:33:25,069 --> 00:33:27,594
Is only me, Mr. Big

460
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:31,639
Yonica. Hi.

461
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:36,047
Listen. Sorry about my reaction to
your song. I didn't mean to offend you.

462
00:33:36,082 --> 00:33:41,417
No. I am sorry. I am so stupid to
not understand that you are woman.

463
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:42,247
Uh, sorry?

464
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:47,084
In Turaqi we have no word for
this. Same as for a woman.

465
00:33:48,593 --> 00:33:50,927
No, no, no.
That's not it.

466
00:33:50,962 --> 00:33:54,295
I predict most people.
Why not you?

467
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,630
How my ass make
you puke?

468
00:33:57,735 --> 00:34:00,203
Bad babakanoosh or something.

469
00:34:00,271 --> 00:34:02,398
I think you're lovely.
Stunning, actually.

470
00:34:02,473 --> 00:34:03,838
- Lovely?
- Yes.

471
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:07,639
You think attractive?

472
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:10,771
Yep. Definitely.

473
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:18,649
- Does her ass make you puke?
- Who? Who? Who?

474
00:34:18,756 --> 00:34:22,021
That skinny bitch reporter
with the tape recorder.

475
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,049
No.

476
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:26,028
You're a tit man.
Do you want massage?

477
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:28,055
Be a happy ending.

478
00:34:31,002 --> 00:34:32,993
Does your father know that you
talk this way?

479
00:34:33,471 --> 00:34:34,699
- My father?
- Yeah.

480
00:34:35,473 --> 00:34:37,031
I do not speak to him anymore.

481
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:42,744
But he sends me money for dancing
lessons and singing lessons.

482
00:34:44,615 --> 00:34:46,048
I am with Ooq-Mi-Fay now.

483
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,909
And he wants for me
to be big success.

484
00:34:49,554 --> 00:34:52,955
Yonica rules.
That is what he says to me.

485
00:34:53,858 --> 00:34:55,018
- What about your mother?
- Dead.

486
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:56,184
I'm sorry.

487
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,785
For why? You did not kill her.

488
00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:00,998
I don't think so.

489
00:35:02,066 --> 00:35:05,695
Too much sorry. Too much.

490
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:10,000
Jesus Christ!
What is wrong with you?

491
00:35:10,074 --> 00:35:13,202
You are a fucking asshole,
do you know that?

492
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:14,835
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

493
00:35:14,912 --> 00:35:17,476
"I'm sorry".
You're always sorry.

494
00:35:17,511 --> 00:35:20,040
Fuck you, Mr. Sorry.
Fuck you.

495
00:35:20,184 --> 00:35:21,549
Yonica, don't go away mad.

496
00:35:31,095 --> 00:35:31,891
Marsha?

497
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:35,028
<i>Get me a dinner reservation</i>
<i>tonight. Somewhere with soup. </i>

498
00:35:38,102 --> 00:35:41,799
So everything's OK? You're closing
some big deals at the trade show?

499
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:43,807
Is there an actual
reason for this meeting?

500
00:35:45,443 --> 00:35:46,501
I am not big on bullshit.

501
00:35:46,577 --> 00:35:49,947
I'm your host. I want you to be
happy nd that everything is...

502
00:35:49,982 --> 00:35:51,812
well and you're
taken care of.

503
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:54,045
A beautiful woman.

504
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:56,544
There is something we can
agree on after all, then.

505
00:35:57,588 --> 00:35:58,850
Can you get me an introduction?

506
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:01,648
- She's a journalist.
- Who cares?

507
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,688
Sit.
Don't eat all your soup.

508
00:36:06,063 --> 00:36:06,791
Thank you.

509
00:36:11,068 --> 00:36:14,595
<i>So between your father's indictments,</i>
<i>were you still on the lacrosse team?</i>

510
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:16,970
No. I actually blew out my fuckin' knee.
Hey, you.

511
00:36:18,442 --> 00:36:20,342
Hey, we are doing
an interview here.

512
00:36:20,444 --> 00:36:21,978
Omar Sharif wants to meet you.

513
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:24,038
- The actor?
- Better. The president of Ugi Gas.

514
00:36:25,049 --> 00:36:26,038
Sorry. Just one minute.

515
00:36:26,984 --> 00:36:28,315
I'm gonna pick this up in one.

516
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:34,386
who do I have to shoot to get
a fuckin' drink around here?

517
00:36:41,098 --> 00:36:42,065
What are you looking at?

518
00:36:42,633 --> 00:36:43,565
What are you looking at?

519
00:36:47,805 --> 00:36:48,601
Get back to normal!

520
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:54,608
Natalie Hegalhuzen,
Omar Sharif.

521
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:56,680
Exquisitely enraptured, ma chere.

522
00:36:57,114 --> 00:36:59,207
- Pleased to meet you, too.
- Shall we dance?

523
00:37:08,192 --> 00:37:08,988
How're you doin'?

524
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:41,187
How come we Americans
a hard time?

525
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:42,658
An interesting conundrum, isn't it?

526
00:37:43,828 --> 00:37:45,318
Very shrewd of you to ask.

527
00:37:45,963 --> 00:37:47,328
What would I get
for telling you?

528
00:37:48,032 --> 00:37:51,900
The thrill of knowing you're
my confidential source.

529
00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:54,869
The thought of this
leaves me breathless.

530
00:38:05,182 --> 00:38:07,013
My dear, let me explain
something to you.

531
00:38:07,652 --> 00:38:08,914
The Americans
had no plan.

532
00:38:09,854 --> 00:38:11,788
Perhaps next year they
will invade my country.

533
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:15,123
And then, they will either
kill me or throw me in jail.

534
00:38:15,726 --> 00:38:16,420
Or kill me in jail.

535
00:38:17,361 --> 00:38:18,953
Or maybe make me president.

536
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:22,296
Or maybe make me president,
then kill me.

537
00:38:23,067 --> 00:38:26,298
That still doesn't
answer you question.

538
00:38:26,671 --> 00:38:29,834
Why hasn't the U.S. stopped
the Ugi Gas pipeline?

539
00:38:30,074 --> 00:38:32,770
See what you can find out about
Operation Chickenhawk.

540
00:38:32,843 --> 00:38:33,707
Chickenhawk?

541
00:39:26,263 --> 00:39:27,321
Yeah, baby!

542
00:39:28,065 --> 00:39:29,032
Get it out.

543
00:39:45,649 --> 00:39:47,116
<i>A message from the viceroy. </i>

544
00:39:47,852 --> 00:39:48,841
<i>Freedom is messy. </i>

545
00:39:49,453 --> 00:39:52,047
<i>Employees must wash hands</i>
<i>before returning to work. </i>

546
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:08,830
What stinks here?

547
00:40:09,507 --> 00:40:14,035
Yeah. You look like piece of shit.
You smell like piece of shit.

548
00:40:14,111 --> 00:40:15,237
You want some shit?

549
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:30,287
Where're you going?
Night's young.

550
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:31,555
This place is crazy.

551
00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:34,462
Would you like to come back to
my suite for a quiet drink?

552
00:40:34,532 --> 00:40:38,366
Oh, no thank you, Omar. But I will
look into that thing about you told.

553
00:40:41,972 --> 00:40:42,836
Enjoyed it.

554
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:54,009
- I think I'll go back to my hotel.
- Can I drive you?

555
00:40:54,084 --> 00:40:55,278
Oh, no, that's okay.

556
00:40:55,352 --> 00:40:57,286
Let me give you a lift.
I can help you. It's safer that way.

557
00:40:59,156 --> 00:41:01,021
Please.
I'll feel better.

558
00:41:02,059 --> 00:41:03,424
When did all that construction start?

559
00:41:03,994 --> 00:41:07,760
Oh. They're diverting the river Tures
so it runs by the trade show.

560
00:41:07,832 --> 00:41:11,359
They wanted a clear view from
the Tiki Room. It's cute, huh?

561
00:41:13,537 --> 00:41:15,027
What do you think
of that girl, Yonica?

562
00:41:16,273 --> 00:41:17,467
You don't wanna know.

563
00:41:18,008 --> 00:41:19,805
- Come on. Try me.
- Okay.

564
00:41:20,678 --> 00:41:25,327
I think that she's a sad little
girl who's been pimped out...

565
00:41:25,362 --> 00:41:29,977
into a pathetic monstrosity of
alienated Western sexuality.

566
00:41:30,921 --> 00:41:32,855
How do you feel about that, Mr. Hauser?

567
00:41:33,557 --> 00:41:36,924
She's a disaster.
This whole place is a disaster.

568
00:41:37,561 --> 00:41:39,153
So, you're sleeping with her.

569
00:41:39,864 --> 00:41:40,455
No.

570
00:41:40,531 --> 00:41:41,998
Why not?
She seems game.

571
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:46,059
It must be nice to be who you say you
are. To do things you believe in.

572
00:41:46,971 --> 00:41:48,996
That's so simple. So clean.

573
00:41:50,608 --> 00:41:52,269
It's like, you know: "why didn't
I think of that"?

574
00:41:53,077 --> 00:41:57,207
Well, it's hard not to feel like...

575
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:01,418
I'm always on
the losing side.

576
00:42:01,485 --> 00:42:02,509
Well, you are.

577
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,117
Yeah. It gets kinda lonely.

578
00:42:05,956 --> 00:42:09,483
That's why you got all those peasants
and workers to keep you company.

579
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,391
I don't have that big a bed.

580
00:42:12,096 --> 00:42:13,120
Tell me more.

581
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:17,192
I think that you should
take me home now.

582
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:23,032
Yes, well...

583
00:42:23,607 --> 00:42:25,438
thanks for
taking me home.

584
00:42:26,076 --> 00:42:27,134
Oh. Good night then.

585
00:42:41,091 --> 00:42:42,285
Jesus, what was that?

586
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:46,522
I can't do that...

587
00:42:47,965 --> 00:42:50,058
No. You yourself said,
I just don't want to.

588
00:42:50,134 --> 00:42:51,931
- Yeah. Sure.
- And good night.

589
00:42:57,608 --> 00:42:58,870
Tomorrow can I see ya?

590
00:42:59,376 --> 00:43:00,866
- Tomorrow?
- Yeah.

591
00:43:01,512 --> 00:43:03,275
Reporter's Pool, ten a. m.

592
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:06,246
Progress update, people.

593
00:43:06,317 --> 00:43:09,343
Banks West didn't even wait
for the opening ceremony...

594
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:13,049
closing a one point 3
billion dollar deal...

595
00:43:13,157 --> 00:43:17,958
with Roof Branch and Blossom to
restore essential water services...

596
00:43:18,028 --> 00:43:20,826
to the people of Turaqistan!

597
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:22,960
Oh, come on!

598
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:27,761
I'm sure they'd like to give a shout-out
to the Tamerlane- Furg-Bomber...

599
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:31,001
Wing for, for those
humane position strikes...

600
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:35,512
that created this wonderful
opportunity for everyone.

601
00:43:38,882 --> 00:43:40,076
So is this like a date?

602
00:43:41,218 --> 00:43:42,480
This is like obscene.

603
00:43:43,387 --> 00:43:46,049
There's something you can do
for me that would mean a lot.

604
00:43:46,423 --> 00:43:47,048
Name it.

605
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:50,020
Get me a pass out of the Emerald City
so I can see what's really going on.

606
00:43:50,094 --> 00:43:51,925
- Very dangerous.
- I wanna see Fallof.

607
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:53,922
Natalie, there's nothing there.

608
00:43:53,998 --> 00:43:56,296
I wanna know if it's true that
Tamerlane used chemical weapons.

609
00:43:56,367 --> 00:43:58,995
Isn't it a little late to be worrying
about international conventions?

610
00:43:59,737 --> 00:44:04,504
Is nerve gas worse than getting your
head blown off by a laser missile?

611
00:44:04,575 --> 00:44:06,875
Frankly, it's a nuance
that's lost on me.

612
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:09,470
Besides they were cleared,
just read the report.

613
00:44:09,546 --> 00:44:11,173
We're trying to watch
a battle here.

614
00:44:11,248 --> 00:44:12,215
Sorry.

615
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:19,054
Come on, come on, come on.
Give me something. Give me something.

616
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:22,614
Anything's gotta be better
than this Xbox bullshit!

617
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:23,727
Okay, okay.

618
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:29,026
These guys are big in the
Turaqi arts community.

619
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:30,498
You know, the whole downtown scene?

620
00:44:30,567 --> 00:44:32,057
Might give you a good lead.

621
00:44:35,806 --> 00:44:37,831
I'm hit!
I'm hit!

622
00:44:38,308 --> 00:44:40,276
Where's the damn Medevac?

623
00:44:40,811 --> 00:44:42,802
<i>The Tamerlane custom</i>
<i>E-Z missile mount can... </i>

624
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:47,078
<i>be adapted to fit over 200</i>
<i>automobile models... </i>

625
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:48,981
I thought we were all
set with the Ayatollah.

626
00:44:49,053 --> 00:44:49,849
Pick it up, boys.

627
00:44:50,387 --> 00:44:52,821
What do you mean he won't
do a mixed wedding? Who's mixed?

628
00:44:53,323 --> 00:44:56,884
Yonica's Episcopalian?
How the fuck did that happen?

629
00:44:57,261 --> 00:44:58,387
Will the Sufi work?

630
00:44:58,962 --> 00:45:00,691
Let me call you back.
I got another call.

631
00:45:00,764 --> 00:45:01,958
Just get a number for Cat Stevens.

632
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:05,524
Hello. Can you calm down?
Yeah, he's right here.

633
00:45:07,337 --> 00:45:09,237
Yoni...
That was the girl.

634
00:45:09,606 --> 00:45:11,506
She said she can't do the
wedding if you're involved.

635
00:45:11,575 --> 00:45:12,940
She thinks you don't like her.

636
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:14,807
- What?
- She can't work with you.

637
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:16,436
I'm on it, I'm on it.
Okay.

638
00:45:16,513 --> 00:45:19,711
And then Anderson Cooper,
Mr. Salt and Pepper Integrity...

639
00:45:19,746 --> 00:45:22,909
is arriving today and, and all
we have left is a junior suite.

640
00:45:22,986 --> 00:45:25,181
Is that okay? I mean, he is
a Vanderbilt and everything.

641
00:45:25,255 --> 00:45:27,052
There could be repercussions!

642
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:36,763
<i>GuideStar!</i>

643
00:45:36,834 --> 00:45:39,234
<i>You seem a little bit, Mr. Hauser. </i>
<i>Is everything all right?</i>

644
00:45:39,303 --> 00:45:43,239
My hand was shaking.
My hand never shakes.

I can't focus.

647
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:50,774
This girl. This reporter.
They're in my head.

648
00:45:50,848 --> 00:45:51,974
They're in my fucking brain.

<i>That's not good, Mr. Hauser. </i>
<i>Not good. </i>

650
00:45:55,052 --> 00:45:58,419
No, I know it isn't. And now I
gotta see her, the little one.

651
00:45:58,522 --> 00:46:01,013
I gotta bring her food. 'Cause
she won't go to the thing.

652
00:46:02,893 --> 00:46:03,587
Fuck!

<i>Phone cut out</i>
<i>When we were talking today</i>

658
00:46:54,378 --> 00:46:55,310
That was beautiful.

659
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:02,851
- You recorded that yet?
- Fat fucking chance.

660
00:47:02,953 --> 00:47:03,920
Well you should.

661
00:47:05,055 --> 00:47:07,182
I feel like it's like I'm
seeing you for the first time.

662
00:47:07,257 --> 00:47:10,454
Well, you've seen my ass.
And you not liking it.

663
00:47:10,961 --> 00:47:12,451
- Why do you do that?
- Do what?

664
00:47:12,529 --> 00:47:13,996
Talk as if you have no soul.

665
00:47:14,031 --> 00:47:19,264
Nobody cares for my beautiful soul.
They care for my ass.

666
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:21,770
- You sound like a tramp.
- Bitches rule.

667
00:47:22,539 --> 00:47:24,268
Yonica rules.

668
00:47:25,242 --> 00:47:28,507
Virgins are good for
getting fucked. Right?

669
00:47:29,046 --> 00:47:32,209
That is what I am good for. Right?

670
00:47:32,282 --> 00:47:34,011
That's what everybody knows.

671
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:39,219
You know what I think?

672
00:47:40,791 --> 00:47:44,283
I think the girl that wrote
that song was a poet.

673
00:47:45,395 --> 00:47:46,794
I thought that song was really great.

674
00:48:00,844 --> 00:48:02,709
I am not from this world.

675
00:48:04,815 --> 00:48:06,680
I have special powers.

676
00:48:08,285 --> 00:48:11,186
I can see inside
people's brains.

677
00:48:13,924 --> 00:48:15,016
What do you see?

678
00:48:20,797 --> 00:48:22,856
You think you care about me.

679
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:27,393
Neither one of us know why.

680
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:31,730
You're not an
alien life form.

681
00:48:33,477 --> 00:48:36,310
You're just very confused.

682
00:48:38,148 --> 00:48:39,877
And you live in a terrible world.

683
00:48:56,934 --> 00:49:03,100
I cannot be from this place.
I do not belong here.

684
00:49:05,242 --> 00:49:06,834
We have to find a way.

685
00:49:10,047 --> 00:49:11,810
We just have to find a way.

686
00:49:14,051 --> 00:49:15,450
Who are you?

687
00:49:18,522 --> 00:49:19,580
We got stuff here.

688
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:22,059
We got a side of
Clausen Classic Dill,

689
00:49:22,094 --> 00:49:24,118
and Turaqi brand soda.

690
00:49:26,029 --> 00:49:29,089
Extra crispy, all white meat.
You want a piece?

691
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:32,333
It's actually a horrible way
to soothe bad feelings...

692
00:49:34,237 --> 00:49:35,864
but can lead to compulsive eating...

693
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:37,804
But, you know, sometimes you
just gotta do it, right?

694
00:49:46,917 --> 00:49:48,942
What the fuck?

695
00:49:55,025 --> 00:49:55,889
You know what?

696
00:49:57,294 --> 00:50:01,663
I'm gonna blow you up.
you mother fuckin' nice...

697
00:50:01,765 --> 00:50:04,859
suit necktie piece of shit!

698
00:50:07,471 --> 00:50:09,666
Take a rain check on that.

699
00:50:11,108 --> 00:50:12,735
Out of the Emerald City?

700
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:16,870
In fact, baby, the money is right,
I can take you to Chechnya.

701
00:50:17,414 --> 00:50:20,815
I could scrape together
a thousand dollars.

702
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,855
Honey, for a thousand dollar
we take you to Starbucks.

703
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:29,590
So, we open on her,
she's like Snow White.

704
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:34,061
Then he arrives. A two-shot, like in,
Ford's My Darling Clementine.

705
00:50:34,131 --> 00:50:35,996
When Victor Mature
returns to her.

706
00:50:36,066 --> 00:50:38,091
Fuck film, assholes.

707
00:50:41,405 --> 00:50:43,930
I want her on all fours.

708
00:50:44,007 --> 00:50:50,037
Waiting for her phallic
warlord, Ooq-Mi-Fay.

709
00:50:50,113 --> 00:50:52,377
I know it's none of my business,
what are you guys talking about?

710
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:56,018
We're shooting the
wedding night's video.

711
00:50:56,453 --> 00:50:58,318
Yeah, check it out.
We already made the card.

712
00:50:59,456 --> 00:51:01,048
My God.

713
00:51:02,459 --> 00:51:05,019
- How much you guys want for this?
-500 bucks.

714
00:51:05,095 --> 00:51:07,029
I'll give you 50
right now, cash.

715
00:51:07,097 --> 00:51:07,791
Done.

716
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:12,536

There will be ample time
for loving recriminations.

735
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:18,627
But let's deal with this from
a practical perspective.

736
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:24,172
What if we publically
remove one of his testicles?

737
00:52:24,274 --> 00:52:26,003
- Dad, please!
- Shut up.

738
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:28,977
That's not an entirely
unappealing suggestion...

739
00:52:29,012 --> 00:52:31,242
but I'm not sure if that really
gets us where we wanna go.

740
00:52:31,581 --> 00:52:36,018
Honestly, your Excellency, if we're gonna
pull this off so a man of your stature...

741
00:52:36,086 --> 00:52:38,919
you know, a four-time convicted
extortionist and an embezzler like...

742
00:52:39,022 --> 00:52:42,617
yourself is to lead Turaqistan to
its bright and shining future...

743
00:52:42,726 --> 00:52:45,820
Yonica's bridegroom must
be blamelessly pristine.

744
00:52:48,064 --> 00:52:49,929
In other words, we
need a fall guy.

745
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,798
How about your homeboy outside
with the perforated septum?

746
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:54,902
P- per... what?

747
00:52:54,971 --> 00:52:59,965
Go, Marsha. Go, Marsha. You're so fine.
I'm gonna make her change her mind!

748
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:03,911
I have a can of Mace!

749
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:06,642
And I will use it!
Sit down!

750
00:53:13,423 --> 00:53:18,861
I think Bodhi organized this whole thing
and you didn't know anything about it.

751
00:53:18,929 --> 00:53:20,396
Yeah, of course, man.
I didn't know shit.

752
00:53:22,265 --> 00:53:24,893
But, you know, we wanna be
culturally sensitive here.

753
00:53:25,001 --> 00:53:28,061
What is the traditional punishment
for pimping a pop star?

754
00:53:30,006 --> 00:53:32,201
- Wow, that's fucking cold, Pop.
- Shut up.

755
00:53:32,976 --> 00:53:35,137
Drowning in sheep dung.

756
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:36,912
Marsha will make the arrangements.

757
00:53:36,947 --> 00:53:40,815
All right. We've dealt with
the groom. Now for the bride.

758
00:53:41,785 --> 00:53:46,017
20 minutes on TV and the world will
know that this sweet, young girl...

759
00:53:46,089 --> 00:53:51,652
would never participate in such
a foul, foul enterprise. Right?

760
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:53,895
And, Yonica, you didn't
know anything about this.

761
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:57,923
So it has the added benefit of being
true, as my father used to say.

762
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:00,870
All right. We'll announce
the execution tonight.

763
00:54:00,971 --> 00:54:02,233
We'll do the interview tomorrow...

764
00:54:02,305 --> 00:54:05,741
and we go ahead with the wedding
and close the whole damn show.

765
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:07,771
I think we got this worked out, don't you?

766
00:54:08,144 --> 00:54:10,080
- Great.
- All right. Good to see you.

767
00:54:10,115 --> 00:54:11,206
No, no, no...

768
00:54:11,982 --> 00:54:13,040
Thank you so much, sir.

769
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:15,711
Yonica... Honey!
Honey!

770
00:54:16,386 --> 00:54:17,353
Yonica, Yonica!

771
00:54:23,326 --> 00:54:24,884
Thank you. I like bag.

772
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:33,001
Marsha. Get me Katie Couric, Al Jazeera
and a hundred gallons of sheep shit.

773
00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:54,923
<i>Slaves, but... </i>

774
00:54:58,128 --> 00:55:01,564
<i>Slaves, plebians, patricians,</i>
<i>ladies and gentlemen. </i>

775
00:55:02,065 --> 00:55:03,760
<i>Welcome to Pax Romana... </i>

776
00:55:03,833 --> 00:55:06,461
<i>Virginia's number one</i>
<i>Roman-era theme park. </i>

777
00:55:09,539 --> 00:55:13,475
The glory that was Rome.
The grandeur that was Six Flags.

778
00:55:14,577 --> 00:55:17,307
Unfortunately the financing fell
through in the real estate crash...

779
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:20,008
and the whole place went down the
toilet. But it makes my point.

780
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:21,380
Which is...?

781
00:55:24,254 --> 00:55:27,052
Every empire is summed up in
Rome. The Romans, Hauser.

782
00:55:27,857 --> 00:55:30,655
Dudes of the human race.
Torch-bearers of culture.

783
00:55:31,061 --> 00:55:32,221
You and I are Centurions.

784
00:55:32,562 --> 00:55:35,759
Honor bound to defend civilization
against the Barbarians.

785
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:37,390
Let's cut the shit, Walken.

786
00:55:37,467 --> 00:55:39,264
I like killing people as
much as the next guy...

787
00:55:39,369 --> 00:55:43,772
but I signed up to kill the bad ones.
Health clinics, trade unionists...

788
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:48,072
journalists, agricultural co-ops,
Catholic liberation theologians...

789
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:50,408
impoverished Colombian
coffee farmers...

790
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:53,643
These are barbarians, the depraved
opponents of civilization?

791
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:56,844
We turned Central America
into a fucking graveyard.

792
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:59,980
Whoever momentarily interrupts
the accumulation of our wealth...

793
00:56:00,056 --> 00:56:01,318
we pulverize.

794
00:56:02,158 --> 00:56:04,388
I'm just not feeling good
about that anymore, sir.

795
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:09,855
Then do what you
have to do, son.

796
00:56:11,468 --> 00:56:13,459
Thank you for understanding, sir.

797
00:56:14,637 --> 00:56:16,730
- Oh! You asshole.
- Weapon, please?

798
00:56:21,311 --> 00:56:22,209
Let's walk and talk.

799
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:25,775
You didn't really think
I'd let you go, did you?

800
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:28,681
- I was kinda hoping you might, yeah.
- For her?

801
00:56:29,152 --> 00:56:31,780
Please, Walken. We had such
a good working relationship.

802
00:56:31,855 --> 00:56:34,847
Let's not end it like this,
like savages in a theme park.

803
00:56:34,924 --> 00:56:37,093
You get the thumbs down
from the crowd, Hauser.

804
00:56:37,128 --> 00:56:38,059
You're obsolete, dude.

805
00:56:38,094 --> 00:56:40,494
Past your expiration
date, discontinued.

806
00:56:40,563 --> 00:56:42,258
Garbagio, as they say in Latin.

807
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:44,560
Relegated to the trash bin of history.

808
00:56:57,113 --> 00:56:59,781
You shouldn't rummage in the garbage.
Fuck.

809
00:56:59,816 --> 00:57:02,080
Is this one of those plastic
toys you can choke on?

810
00:57:04,187 --> 00:57:05,085
You mother fucker!

811
00:57:29,512 --> 00:57:32,481
Help! I get it. I get it.
Help! Turn it off!

812
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:40,490
Ten minutes with Katie Couric would
get you ten times the audience...

813
00:57:40,525 --> 00:57:42,481
of a whole season of Frontline.
Now, that's a fact.

814
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:44,254
Yeah, but wh-why would they
want me to do the interview?

815
00:57:44,327 --> 00:57:46,056
You? Your uncompromising
integrity...

816
00:57:46,196 --> 00:57:48,998
your movie star good looks and
I don't think Katie Couric...

817
00:57:49,033 --> 00:57:50,932
wants to come to this beautiful
fucking vacation spot.

818
00:57:51,601 --> 00:57:53,870
You know I'm not gonna do
a P.R. puff piece, right?

819
00:57:53,905 --> 00:57:55,497
Just do the story.
Get the real girl.

820
00:57:55,572 --> 00:57:58,268
The real girl?
Is there anything real left to get?

821
00:57:58,341 --> 00:57:59,569
Can she actually talk?

822
00:57:59,642 --> 00:58:01,303
She's just a needy
little kid, Natalie.

823
00:58:01,377 --> 00:58:04,369
I know, and she's spoiled, she's
over-sexed, she's tone deaf.

824
00:58:04,447 --> 00:58:05,709
Well she's a brand, Hauser.

825
00:58:05,782 --> 00:58:07,272
Stuff happens.
She needs a mom.

826
00:58:08,051 --> 00:58:10,952
- Yeah. And don't look at me.
- I like looking at you.

827
00:58:13,122 --> 00:58:17,388
You can say anything you want, okay?
No holds barred delay. I'll make it live.

828
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:19,951
You're crazy.
This bitch hates me.

829
00:58:20,029 --> 00:58:22,429
- She doesn't hate you.
- She hates me.

830
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:24,694
- No she doesn't.
- She does. I know.

831
00:58:26,903 --> 00:58:27,801
Yeah, hello.

832
00:58:27,871 --> 00:58:30,237
<i>I have lists of</i>
<i>Omar's whereabouts. </i>

833
00:58:30,306 --> 00:58:31,102
I'll get to it.

834
00:58:31,774 --> 00:58:33,366
- Put your seatbelt on.
- Fuck off.

835
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:35,739
Shit.

836
00:58:52,095 --> 00:58:53,619
So we're all set?

837
00:58:54,797 --> 00:58:57,231
This sucks.
I hate this.

838
00:58:58,768 --> 00:59:00,827
- What sucks, sweetheart?
- This location.

839
00:59:01,604 --> 00:59:02,935
What's wrong with it?

840
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:06,308
I am not liking it.
It blows.

841
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:11,803
This is 2000 years of Turaqi culture.
It's a nice spot for it, actually.

842
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:12,973
Okay, sweetie?

843
00:59:15,184 --> 00:59:16,845
I want to do it...

844
00:59:19,122 --> 00:59:19,850
there.

845
00:59:22,659 --> 00:59:26,755
- We're all set up right here.
- There or nowhere.

846
00:59:28,998 --> 00:59:29,692
Okay?

847
00:59:32,268 --> 00:59:33,599
There's nice too.

848
00:59:35,471 --> 00:59:35,960
Hello.

849
00:59:38,007 --> 00:59:38,871
Hello.

850
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:52,315
What is this place?

851
00:59:53,456 --> 00:59:54,115
Beautiful.

852
00:59:55,525 --> 00:59:57,254
You see? She's just
a needy little kid.

853
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:02,326
This light is so cool.

854
01:00:04,901 --> 01:00:05,890
Look at this!

855
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:07,865
Be careful.

856
01:00:16,112 --> 01:00:19,809
I want to do it here.
Come, inspect this from me.

857
01:00:20,817 --> 01:00:21,511
Beautiful.

858
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:25,485
This place is so sad.
I love that.

859
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:27,923
I'm going to see the rest.

860
01:00:34,263 --> 01:00:35,992
Hey, cowboy. You happen
to have a Cliff bar?

861
01:00:36,099 --> 01:00:37,088
- You hungry?
- I could eat.

862
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:38,292
Let's find the kitchen.

863
01:00:39,836 --> 01:00:42,464
Look at this. An 82 margaux.
They must have left in a hurry.

864
01:00:43,539 --> 01:00:45,006
We can be shot
for looting.

865
01:00:45,074 --> 01:00:47,099
We can be shot for
anything in Turaqistan.

866
01:00:48,578 --> 01:00:50,842
Let's see. There must be
an opener here somewhere.

867
01:00:51,714 --> 01:00:54,342
I just don't know if I'm domestic
enough to make a meal out of...

868
01:00:54,417 --> 01:00:57,352
olives and caviar
and peanut butter.

869
01:00:58,354 --> 01:01:00,888
Yonica! There's food!

870
01:01:00,923 --> 01:01:02,356
Very high-tech
for Turaqistan.

871
01:01:03,993 --> 01:01:05,790
Crazy little brat.

872
01:01:06,095 --> 01:01:08,188
If she's a virgin...

873
01:01:08,564 --> 01:01:09,792
I'm Dick Cheney.

874
01:01:22,111 --> 01:01:23,510
Yonica, would you like some wine?

875
01:01:25,048 --> 01:01:28,313
No. I hate wine.
It's so sour.

876
01:01:31,287 --> 01:01:32,345
Milk is good.

877
01:01:39,595 --> 01:01:42,894
- I want a picture of you two.
- No pictures.

878
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:45,567
Okay, one.

879
01:01:46,235 --> 01:01:47,065
Get in.

880
01:01:59,048 --> 01:02:00,413
So you two getting married?

881
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:08,885
Because you are already
married with wife in America?

882
01:02:09,292 --> 01:02:11,453
Everybody wants
American wife.

883
01:02:11,961 --> 01:02:12,655
No.

884
01:02:13,429 --> 01:02:14,225
Never were married?

885
01:02:17,467 --> 01:02:18,525
Was once actually.

886
01:02:21,104 --> 01:02:21,968
What happened?

887
01:02:25,875 --> 01:02:27,900
It's not that interesting.

888
01:02:47,029 --> 01:02:48,053
What happened?

889
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:55,934
Haven't spoken of it in a long time.

890
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:05,238
<i>She was killed. </i>

891
01:03:06,349 --> 01:03:07,179
<i>Murdered. </i>

892
01:03:09,819 --> 01:03:12,754
I came home one night and my
beautiful wife had been slaughtered.

893
01:03:15,091 --> 01:03:20,256
I had a little girl
and she was taken.

894
01:03:21,931 --> 01:03:24,229
No ransom note, nothing.
Just gone.

895
01:03:26,669 --> 01:03:28,534
- Why?
- I don't know.

896
01:03:29,939 --> 01:03:31,031
Who would do that?

897
01:03:31,674 --> 01:03:36,338
I don't know anything except
it was all because of me.

898
01:03:39,415 --> 01:03:40,347
What do you mean?

899
01:03:41,450 --> 01:03:45,250
I had many enemies.
I've done many things.

900
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:52,192
What was her name?
Your daughter?

901
01:03:55,364 --> 01:03:55,955
Cara.

902
01:03:59,802 --> 01:04:00,962
There's a reason
I do this work.

903
01:04:05,174 --> 01:04:06,300
I don't have to feel anything.

904
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:10,779
That's so fucked up.

905
01:04:14,784 --> 01:04:15,546
Hey. Whassup?

906
01:04:20,556 --> 01:04:21,215
Get out!

907
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:28,056
Sometimes I think is better
not to feel. Just skip it.

908
01:04:29,232 --> 01:04:31,029
How long can you
live that way?

909
01:04:31,601 --> 01:04:34,536
The poison's just old. It's
like a slow motion suicide.

910
01:04:34,937 --> 01:04:37,804
Or wake up every day and wonder if
you have the courage to walk away...

911
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:42,004
to say: no, I won't do that. I'm
not that person. I'm not that thing.

912
01:04:47,984 --> 01:04:50,350
You think I should
not marry Ooq-Mi-Fay?

913
01:04:52,922 --> 01:04:54,514
<i>Hey, boss we have a problem. </i>

914
01:04:57,226 --> 01:04:58,318
Hold that thought.

915
01:05:02,632 --> 01:05:04,031
What's the problem, guys?

916
01:05:11,007 --> 01:05:12,133
Try some caviar.

917
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:13,834
It's so good!

918
01:05:16,212 --> 01:05:17,042
I love.

919
01:05:17,546 --> 01:05:20,037
My mom would always try to
get me to eat weird stuff.

920
01:05:20,182 --> 01:05:22,446
Tempeh and
wheatgrass...

921
01:05:22,518 --> 01:05:24,850
and all I ever wanted
was peanut butter.

922
01:05:27,790 --> 01:05:29,155
He's a complicated guy, huh?

923
01:05:33,029 --> 01:05:34,223
Not what'd you think.

924
01:05:41,537 --> 01:05:43,801
Hey, not so tough
today, huh?

925
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:50,840
Hey, look, the little
girl has crowns.

926
01:05:51,547 --> 01:05:54,243
You think you can drown
me with the sheep shit.

927
01:05:55,051 --> 01:05:56,279
I don't think so.

928
01:05:56,953 --> 01:05:58,545
You want we should
take video now?

929
01:05:59,121 --> 01:06:00,281
Or kill him first?

930
01:06:01,057 --> 01:06:05,494
Be less blood if you kill me first, more
fun if you cut it off while I'm alive.

931
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:07,028
- Shut up.
- Okay.

932
01:06:07,063 --> 01:06:10,692
I think I could take those two ears
and I can put them on my Harley.

933
01:06:10,766 --> 01:06:13,257
Maybe I can pick up
KROQ on my radio.

934
01:06:13,903 --> 01:06:16,098
Oh, pretty face. Bye.

935
01:06:20,176 --> 01:06:23,976
You ought to do some face.
Taste.

936
01:06:42,198 --> 01:06:42,892
Stay!

937
01:07:43,826 --> 01:07:47,387
Cut off the fingers I
used to wipe my ass.

938
01:08:08,217 --> 01:08:10,151
I cannot believe you just did that!

939
01:08:53,896 --> 01:08:57,832
What person could squeeze
eyeballs from Bodhi Bhundhang?

940
01:09:00,503 --> 01:09:03,495
And that asshole tells me
not to marry Ooq-Mi-Fay?

941
01:09:03,606 --> 01:09:05,801
I'm fucking marry Ooq-Mi-Fay.

942
01:09:05,875 --> 01:09:09,333
He's pig.
And I'm whore.

943
01:09:10,246 --> 01:09:12,771
- You want me to take the freeway?
- Yeah. Whatever.

944
01:09:13,282 --> 01:09:16,979
It is who I am.
I am that person.

945
01:09:17,686 --> 01:09:20,655
And if I'm going to be whore,
at least I can be rich.

946
01:09:21,056 --> 01:09:25,060
I just want to make soulful
music and be sad and rich.

947
01:09:25,095 --> 01:09:27,426
You don't have to marry
some asshole to do that.

948
01:09:28,230 --> 01:09:31,461
Natalie, you will
be my bridesmaid?

949
01:09:33,636 --> 01:09:34,295
Please?

950
01:09:36,038 --> 01:09:40,600
My father, he's coming. I haven't
seen him since I was baby.

951
01:09:42,311 --> 01:09:43,869
It will be nice to meet him.

952
01:09:48,017 --> 01:09:50,850
And if you are there
I will not be so afraid.

953
01:09:59,628 --> 01:10:01,027
What am I gonna wear?

954
01:10:01,997 --> 01:10:04,830
- What about Katie Courich?
- Fuck her.

955
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:05,832
Fuck them all.

956
01:10:14,810 --> 01:10:16,175
Miami Beach Hotel.

957
01:10:19,114 --> 01:10:22,015
Jeff? I just sent you a photo
of that Tamerlane guy.

958
01:10:22,084 --> 01:10:25,955
He just slaughtered half a dozen
of Ooq- Mi-Fay Taqnufmini's posse...

959
01:10:25,990 --> 01:10:27,752
Find out who the fuck this guy is.

960
01:10:33,062 --> 01:10:35,553
<i>Hey. I just got this message</i>
<i>from the Viceroy. </i>

961
01:10:37,967 --> 01:10:42,199
<i>"We didn't front you $1.3 million to</i>
<i>whack a bunch of Fifty Cent wannabes. </i>

962
01:10:42,304 --> 01:10:46,400
<i>You know what I'm saying? You</i>

963
01:10:46,475 --> 01:10:48,568
<i>And may I just</i>
<i>add personally. </i>

964
01:10:48,644 --> 01:10:51,010
<i>What the fuck are you doing?</i>

965
01:10:51,413 --> 01:10:56,180
<i>Will you kill the mother fucker so we</i>
<i>can get the hell out of this shithole?</i>

966
01:10:56,552 --> 01:10:58,019
<i>What are you doing?</i>

967
01:10:58,153 --> 01:11:00,553
<i>Hello? Is there anyone in th-?</i>

968
01:11:06,795 --> 01:11:07,727
<i>Hey, it's Natalie. </i>

969
01:11:07,796 --> 01:11:10,663
<i>I'm either unmasking corporate</i>
<i>greed or washing my hair. </i>

970
01:11:10,766 --> 01:11:11,664
<i>So leave a message. </i>

971
01:11:26,015 --> 01:11:27,744
That's good. Thanks. Great.

972
01:11:29,785 --> 01:11:30,479
Is that good?

973
01:11:31,487 --> 01:11:33,682
That looks great. Everything you're
doing is great. It's really great.

974
01:11:33,789 --> 01:11:36,917
My communications degree
is finally paying off.

975
01:11:37,726 --> 01:11:38,920
Where is Omar?

976
01:11:39,028 --> 01:11:42,363
Well, let me check. Omar?

977
01:11:42,398 --> 01:11:45,196
<i>- Camera Four, Marsha. Camera Four. </i>
- Omar's Camera Four.

978
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:46,461
Why don't you pull in?

979
01:11:47,036 --> 01:11:48,298
Do you have his
Blackberry address?

980
01:11:48,370 --> 01:11:49,394
Laptop.

981
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:54,902
By the way, Anderson Cooper
cannot make the wedding.

982
01:11:54,977 --> 01:11:58,469
- What room was he going to stay in?
- Eleven-oh-one.

983
01:12:02,818 --> 01:12:05,286
Just you, Cowboy.

984
01:12:12,161 --> 01:12:16,222
Oh, jeez. Gosh. By the
way. This came for you.

985
01:12:16,999 --> 01:12:17,624
I think...

986
01:12:19,034 --> 01:12:21,298
...It must have
been this morning and...

987
01:12:27,943 --> 01:12:29,274
<i>This is Natalie Hegalhuzen. </i>

988
01:12:29,345 --> 01:12:33,076
<i>I am being held by the Provisional</i>
<i>Liberation Army of Greater Turaqistan. </i>

989
01:12:33,782 --> 01:12:37,411
<i>I will be executed unless the</i>
<i>following demands are met by 6 pm. </i>

990
01:12:40,422 --> 01:12:45,257
The complete unconditional withdrawal of
all Tamerlane forces from Turaqistan.

991
01:12:47,262 --> 01:12:50,254
The dissolution of the criminal's
INS state of Israel.

992
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:55,532
Three. The acquisition by the Turaqi
National Basketball team...

993
01:12:55,604 --> 01:12:59,404
of LeBron James for a player
to be named later.

994
01:13:01,076 --> 01:13:03,670
I'm unhurt and
well-treated...

995
01:13:04,213 --> 01:13:06,181
And am right where I wanted to be.

996
01:13:07,249 --> 01:13:09,084
You're improvising, bitch.
I hate that!

997
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:10,142
I know where she is.

998
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:12,983
No. Wait a second!
We're live in 6 hours.

999
01:13:13,055 --> 01:13:14,420
I trust you.
You handle everything.

1000
01:13:14,490 --> 01:13:17,891
Oh, Jesus Mary and Joseph.

1001
01:13:21,830 --> 01:13:23,058
How are you, sir?
Nice to see you, sir.

1002
01:13:23,265 --> 01:13:23,856
You can go.

1003
01:13:32,775 --> 01:13:34,037
Jerry, how do I get to Fallaf?

1004
01:13:34,109 --> 01:13:35,804
<i>Fallaf. </i>
<i>Are you out of your mind?</i>

1005
01:13:35,878 --> 01:13:38,938
<i>Here at GuideStar we definitely</i>
<i>call Fallaf a no-go zone. </i>

1006
01:13:40,215 --> 01:13:41,546
<i>That's snuff city, dude. </i>

1007
01:13:41,650 --> 01:13:43,845
Hey, don't get cute. Just
give me the damn directions.

1008
01:13:43,919 --> 01:13:46,149
<i>You sound a little angry, rather</i>
<i>emotional. It's a good thing. </i>

1009
01:13:46,221 --> 01:13:47,586
<i>Good. Let it go. </i>

1010
01:13:48,056 --> 01:13:50,547
Is that the best you can do for
seventy-nine ninety-five a month?

1011
01:13:52,594 --> 01:13:54,892
Steven Seagal is like
500 pounds now.

1012
01:13:55,798 --> 01:13:58,562
They use body doubles for
everything, but this.

1013
01:14:01,303 --> 01:14:02,905
How many times do I have to tell you?

1014
01:14:02,940 --> 01:14:05,169
I am opposed to the occupation.

1015
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:10,268
I have railed against it in every
significant journal in the world!

1016
01:14:13,916 --> 01:14:19,047
I think you are mistaking me with
someone who actually gives a fuck.

1017
01:14:21,023 --> 01:14:22,752
Hey, you're just a
gift for us, babe.

1018
01:14:22,825 --> 01:14:24,324
What do I do when
I get to Nafluni?

1019
01:14:24,359 --> 01:14:27,760
<i>There's a Mobil station</i>
<i>on your right. See it?</i>

1020
01:14:27,830 --> 01:14:29,062
Yeah. I think so.

1021
01:14:29,097 --> 01:14:32,191
<i>Great. Take the next</i>
<i>right. Follow the road. </i>

1022
01:14:33,068 --> 01:14:35,059
<i>If you're a praying man,</i>
<i>I'd start about now. </i>

1023
01:14:37,506 --> 01:14:39,599
Can we kill her already?
I'm getting hungry.

1024
01:14:39,708 --> 01:14:42,472
We're still working out the
international distribution rights.

1025
01:14:45,781 --> 01:14:47,772
I want to...

1026
01:14:49,585 --> 01:14:51,519
put the camera
lower this time.

1027
01:14:52,087 --> 01:14:54,248
Oh, you mean like the construction
guard decapitation, huh?

1028
01:14:55,023 --> 01:14:56,991
But you want it from here to
there or from there to here?

1029
01:14:57,059 --> 01:14:58,924
- All the way.
- All the way's gonna be messy.

1030
01:14:59,027 --> 01:15:00,085
Yeah, but it's art.

1031
01:15:36,832 --> 01:15:39,062
- Do you have any candy?
- No. Get lost.

1032
01:15:39,935 --> 01:15:42,335
I told you these assholes
never have shit.

1033
01:15:43,505 --> 01:15:44,904
Looking for the kidnapped bitch?

1034
01:15:47,676 --> 01:15:48,475
American?

1035
01:15:48,510 --> 01:15:51,138
We have three. Two yellow
hair and one dark hair.

1036
01:15:51,246 --> 01:15:52,235
Dark hair.

1037
01:15:56,952 --> 01:15:57,577
Where?

1038
01:16:01,056 --> 01:16:02,023
Show me.

1039
01:16:14,770 --> 01:16:22,734
10? No. How about 20?
Okay. It's a deal.

1040
01:16:23,845 --> 01:16:25,608
Shut up!
Let's do it.

1041
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:36,455
Don't shoot, man!

1042
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:39,889
Hey, we're sorry. Chill.

1043
01:16:39,995 --> 01:16:41,860
I'm sorry, just take the girl.
We don't want the girl.

1044
01:16:41,930 --> 01:16:44,228
We just, we do movies, man.
We love to make movies.

1045
01:16:44,299 --> 01:16:45,493
Yeah, yeah, movies.

1046
01:16:46,368 --> 01:16:47,892
Don't get up, guys.
We gotta run.

1047
01:16:52,541 --> 01:16:54,805
Fuck, dude. That was intense.

1048
01:16:57,312 --> 01:16:59,507
Okay. We're okay.

1049
01:17:05,387 --> 01:17:08,379
Next time bring
some candy asshole.

1050
01:17:10,025 --> 01:17:13,984
<i>Mr. Hauser? I told you Fallaf</i>
<i>was not a good idea, didn't I?</i>

1051
01:17:14,062 --> 01:17:17,156
<i>It's a no-go zone. </i>
<i>And you went. </i>

1052
01:17:17,232 --> 01:17:18,699
<i>That was not a good idea. </i>

1053
01:17:29,811 --> 01:17:30,368
Get down!

1054
01:17:34,016 --> 01:17:34,573
Go.

1055
01:17:40,622 --> 01:17:43,056
Could you please try
to call Natalie again?

1056
01:17:49,197 --> 01:17:50,858
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1057
01:17:50,932 --> 01:17:52,957
What, my English
not so good?

1058
01:17:53,035 --> 01:17:54,525
Come on.
I love you.

1059
01:17:56,938 --> 01:17:59,372
Come on here.
Come on here.

1060
01:18:10,485 --> 01:18:13,010
Get down, get down!

1061
01:18:18,593 --> 01:18:19,560
Get up.

1062
01:18:39,915 --> 01:18:41,143
Hey, you in charge?

1063
01:18:41,216 --> 01:18:44,344
- Who the fuck's in charge?
- No one! I'm no one!

1064
01:18:44,419 --> 01:18:46,853
- What are you lookin' at, bitch?
- I'm no one!

1065
01:20:07,369 --> 01:20:10,429
A couple of quick announcements.

1066
01:20:11,006 --> 01:20:14,737
The panel discussion, the Redemptive
Power of the Hedge Fund Derivative...

1067
01:20:15,210 --> 01:20:17,542
has been moved to the mini ballroom.

1068
01:20:18,046 --> 01:20:21,538
Don't forget to go to the Meet
and Greet cocktail reception...

1069
01:20:22,083 --> 01:20:26,918
at the Tiki Room at five
and pick up your gift bags.

1070
01:20:27,322 --> 01:20:31,622
They've got a coffee mug
and a desert umbrella...

1071
01:20:31,693 --> 01:20:34,025
foam beer
Koozie and a...

1072
01:20:35,030 --> 01:20:37,555
autographed copy
from you know who...

1073
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:41,500
of "How I Conquered the World and
Worked Out Issues With My Dad".

1074
01:21:34,389 --> 01:21:35,413
Take care of the kid.

1075
01:21:37,192 --> 01:21:38,557
'Cause I might have to go too.

1076
01:21:42,898 --> 01:21:43,990
You don't have to.

1077
01:21:46,268 --> 01:21:47,098
Yes, I do.

1078
01:23:20,929 --> 01:23:21,759
Natalie.

1079
01:23:22,263 --> 01:23:25,824
I saw your face and
creation held its breath.

1080
01:23:26,501 --> 01:23:27,763
I'm coming.

1081
01:23:32,207 --> 01:23:34,175
No, no, no...

1082
01:23:41,449 --> 01:23:44,247
Silly me. I was expecting
a beautiful woman.

1083
01:23:44,319 --> 01:23:45,081
Sorry.

1084
01:23:45,553 --> 01:23:46,281
Hauser...

1085
01:23:46,955 --> 01:23:49,389
Love does get one into
difficult situations.

1086
01:23:50,325 --> 01:23:51,553
Somebody's gonna kill you.

1087
01:23:54,062 --> 01:23:55,086
It was supposed to be me.

1088
01:23:56,598 --> 01:23:57,826
Triple your security.

1089
01:23:59,134 --> 01:24:00,294
Stay off the streets.

1090
01:24:00,902 --> 01:24:03,336
With a little skill you
may actually stay alive.

1091
01:24:16,084 --> 01:24:18,382
- How may I thank you?
- No need.

1092
01:24:26,494 --> 01:24:28,962
We're in a constant
state of war, Hauser.

1093
01:24:29,964 --> 01:24:32,023
We kill our brothers,
complete strangers...

1094
01:24:32,100 --> 01:24:33,260
the guilty and the innocent.

1095
01:24:34,936 --> 01:24:36,961
We are at war with
our own hearts.

1096
01:24:37,439 --> 01:24:40,237
Love is a cease-fire
that's destined to fail.

1097
01:24:41,009 --> 01:24:43,170
But, as I said...

1098
01:24:44,045 --> 01:24:46,513
it does get us into
tricky situations.

1099
01:24:48,917 --> 01:24:51,351
Sometimes the back
of a garbage truck.

1100
01:24:56,357 --> 01:24:59,190
The ultimate Chickenhawk
is roosting close-by.

1101
01:25:07,068 --> 01:25:07,932
Good luck.

1102
01:25:21,249 --> 01:25:22,876
She says she's a bridesmaid.

1103
01:25:25,086 --> 01:25:28,214
- You got an extra dress?
- Yes.

1104
01:25:29,858 --> 01:25:31,120
<i>For all of us at Tamerlane... </i>

1105
01:25:31,759 --> 01:25:34,489
<i>I extend a heartfelt</i>
<i>good luck and God bless... </i>

1106
01:25:34,562 --> 01:25:35,995
<i>whoever that god may be. </i>

1107
01:25:36,498 --> 01:25:38,864
<i>To our happy young couple. </i>
<i>Shalom. </i>

1108
01:25:40,635 --> 01:25:41,158
<i>Shit. </i>

1109
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:07,419
We have someone to do
your hair and makeup.

1110
01:26:08,396 --> 01:26:09,795
I could do this.

1111
01:26:10,498 --> 01:26:11,965
Sit down!

1112
01:26:14,469 --> 01:26:15,458
Clean yourself!

1113
01:26:19,541 --> 01:26:23,033
We gotta go to the viceroy.
Where the hell is Hauser?

1114
01:26:24,546 --> 01:26:25,308
Asshole.

1115
01:26:27,982 --> 01:26:28,539
All right.

1116
01:26:32,554 --> 01:26:36,490
I am going to tell that bastard that
I want to go shopping in America.

1117
01:26:37,025 --> 01:26:40,051
And I never come back.
Can I stay with you?

1118
01:26:40,695 --> 01:26:42,890
Yes. Yes. Yes.

1119
01:26:57,679 --> 01:26:58,646
It's time.

1120
01:27:22,537 --> 01:27:25,870
Where are you?
I wanna see you.

1121
01:27:25,940 --> 01:27:28,500
<i>Hauser. I'm about to</i>
<i>address the weddin'.</i>

1122
01:27:28,576 --> 01:27:30,476
<i>You're just gonna have</i>
<i>to wait 'til I'm done. </i>

1123
01:27:30,979 --> 01:27:32,207
I've waited long enough.

1124
01:27:48,863 --> 01:27:49,955
Hauser.

1125
01:27:51,199 --> 01:27:54,965
Hello, Walken.
You look fabulous.

1126
01:27:55,637 --> 01:27:57,036
How did you know?

1127
01:27:57,639 --> 01:27:59,505
Where else would you be?

1128
01:27:59,540 --> 01:28:01,701
And going to the
Viceroy in five...

1129
01:28:01,776 --> 01:28:04,301
four, three, two...

1130
01:28:05,113 --> 01:28:07,479
<i>Wonderful opportunities</i>
<i>here, Hauser. </i>

1131
01:28:07,548 --> 01:28:11,848
<i>As long as these towel-heads don't</i>
<i>look up freedom in the dictionary. </i>

1132
01:28:11,953 --> 01:28:16,822
<i>To use one of your own homespun colloquialisms</i>
<i>let's cut the shit, shall we?</i>

1133
01:28:16,891 --> 01:28:18,119
That is your viceroy?

1134
01:28:18,192 --> 01:28:20,854
You know what your problem is, Hauser?
You're a moralist.

1135
01:28:20,962 --> 01:28:23,829
That's why you're so
much fun to fuck with.

1136
01:28:23,898 --> 01:28:28,460
War is the improvement of
investments by other means.

1137
01:28:28,536 --> 01:28:32,870
For dummies. The USA is a
subdivision of Tamerlane.

1138
01:28:32,974 --> 01:28:36,432
Democracy, the war on
terror, the war on drugs...

1139
01:28:36,511 --> 01:28:39,639
these are all focus group
slogans for Tamerlane.

1140
01:28:39,747 --> 01:28:44,878
You murdered my wife.
And I'm here to kill you for that.

1141
01:28:44,986 --> 01:28:49,047
You were such a superb
killing machine, Hauser.

1142
01:28:49,157 --> 01:28:50,124
What happened to you?

1143
01:28:50,925 --> 01:28:52,859
You've had a whole week to kill Omar.

1144
01:28:53,361 --> 01:28:57,491
Of course I could have liquidated you
after you thought you'd killed me.

1145
01:28:57,565 --> 01:29:01,126
Right after I tried to kiss you and
you threw me in the garbage truck.

1146
01:29:01,202 --> 01:29:06,003
It's gonna be hard to torture
someone who's mostly dead.

1147
01:29:07,208 --> 01:29:08,971
But I'm gonna try...

1148
01:29:10,945 --> 01:29:12,071
to enjoy it.

1149
01:29:12,146 --> 01:29:16,549
But, by killing the woman
and kidnapping the girl...

1150
01:29:16,651 --> 01:29:17,481
Oh, my God.

1151
01:29:17,585 --> 01:29:19,314
<i>... that was so much more satisfying. </i>

1152
01:29:19,387 --> 01:29:22,015
I left you in a state
of constant agony.

1153
01:29:22,123 --> 01:29:26,526
<i>You ever wonder what the ideology</i>
<i>of vibrio cholerae bacterium... </i>

1154
01:29:26,627 --> 01:29:32,122
<i>or the system of Yersinia pestis the</i>
<i>bacteria that causes bubonic plague. </i>

1155
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:33,428
I'll tell you, Hauser.

1156
01:29:34,168 --> 01:29:35,726
Perpetuation.

1157
01:29:36,270 --> 01:29:38,329
An infinite succession of generations.

1158
01:29:38,439 --> 01:29:40,634
Immortality on the installment plan.

1159
01:29:40,742 --> 01:29:42,977
I wish I had that
sort of esprit d'corps.

1160
01:29:43,012 --> 01:29:44,945
That bacterial team spirit.

1161
01:29:45,780 --> 01:29:50,046
Talk about legacy.
Talk about empire.

1162
01:29:51,085 --> 01:29:54,646
You're gonna tell me
what you did with her...

1163
01:29:56,824 --> 01:29:58,291
then I'm gonna kill you again.

1164
01:29:58,926 --> 01:30:01,121
- Do you understand, old man?
- Don't you get it?

1165
01:30:01,963 --> 01:30:03,328
Your daughter happens...

1166
01:30:07,902 --> 01:30:09,335
Shut it down!

1167
01:30:10,838 --> 01:30:12,465
<i>Your daughter, Hauser. </i>

1168
01:30:17,178 --> 01:30:24,550
Your daughter is about to be married.
And, Daddy you're the father of the bride.

1169
01:30:28,589 --> 01:30:31,387
God, that's a
conversation stopper.

1170
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:35,051
Well, you just sit back
and enjoy the show.

1171
01:30:35,863 --> 01:30:38,423
You must be a real proud daddy.

1172
01:30:41,302 --> 01:30:42,360
Here she comes.

1173
01:30:46,641 --> 01:30:49,007
Ain't you the proudest daddy?
Look at that.

1174
01:30:49,377 --> 01:30:50,469
She turned out good.

1175
01:30:50,878 --> 01:30:55,110
She looks good in that white dress
and those little white boots.

1176
01:30:59,353 --> 01:31:02,049
A white dress
and white boots.

1177
01:31:07,495 --> 01:31:08,325
Oh, look at that.

1178
01:31:08,896 --> 01:31:11,262
Don't you think the little
whore turned out well?

1179
01:31:11,332 --> 01:31:14,902
I promised her Daddy would
be here. And here you are.

1180
01:31:14,937 --> 01:31:15,732
Shoot him!

1181
01:31:16,571 --> 01:31:18,402
The father of the bride!

1182
01:31:46,968 --> 01:31:49,027
Hauser!
Where are you, Hauser?

1183
01:31:49,904 --> 01:31:52,940
Come on, fight me like a dude.
Face me Hauser.

1184
01:31:52,975 --> 01:31:53,940
Come on!

1185
01:31:53,975 --> 01:31:56,705
I can control all of
this with my eyes.

1186
01:32:36,117 --> 01:32:36,811
Yonica!

1187
01:32:39,120 --> 01:32:40,382
- Yonica.
- Shut the fuck up!

1188
01:32:41,789 --> 01:32:43,518
- Yonica. Yonica.
- Shut the fuck up! Shut up.

1189
01:32:46,294 --> 01:32:47,226
Get done, come on.

1190
01:32:48,029 --> 01:32:52,133
Dearly beloved, friends,
believers and infidels.

1191
01:32:52,168 --> 01:32:53,725
We are gathered here today...

1192
01:32:54,402 --> 01:32:58,338
to join together in holy
matrimony this man and this...

1193
01:32:58,406 --> 01:33:01,637
Yonica! Yonica!

1194
01:33:01,742 --> 01:33:02,401
Hauser!

1195
01:33:09,350 --> 01:33:12,842
You can't do this.
I won't let you.

1196
01:33:15,056 --> 01:33:16,182
I'm your father.

1197
01:33:19,627 --> 01:33:20,184
Catch him.

1198
01:33:24,999 --> 01:33:25,795
It's me.

1199
01:33:28,002 --> 01:33:30,232
I've loved you since the
minute you were born.

1200
01:33:30,838 --> 01:33:32,032
I will kill you!

1201
01:33:41,449 --> 01:33:42,575
It's gonna be okay.

1202
01:33:58,799 --> 01:34:00,767
We're gonna be a family again.

1203
01:34:18,919 --> 01:34:22,252
Come on!

1204
01:34:33,100 --> 01:34:34,829
Yonica, Yonica.

1205
01:34:34,902 --> 01:34:36,062
Let go of that!
Don't do that.

1206
01:34:37,605 --> 01:34:39,072
What's going on?

1207
01:34:43,044 --> 01:34:43,738
Go, go, go, go, go!

1208
01:34:44,111 --> 01:34:44,975
Go, go, go!

1209
01:34:51,952 --> 01:34:55,479
Get me back to the bunker.
Headset.

1210
01:34:56,557 --> 01:34:57,990
Get me a tomahawk.

1211
01:34:59,093 --> 01:35:00,993
Blow this whole fuckin' place to shit.

1212
01:35:01,062 --> 01:35:01,861
Yes, sir.

1213
01:35:01,896 --> 01:35:05,093
Terrorists at the weddin'.
We've got 'em cornered.

1214
01:35:05,800 --> 01:35:07,791
So close to the bunker
could be dangerous, sir.

1215
01:35:08,703 --> 01:35:10,796
Haven't you heard of
a surgical strike?

1216
01:35:12,773 --> 01:35:14,468
- Launch it.
- Firing two-one.

1217
01:35:28,589 --> 01:35:30,955
Viceroy coming through.
Viceroy coming through.

1218
01:35:32,893 --> 01:35:34,952
You should have let
me finish the job!

1219
01:35:50,077 --> 01:35:53,012
Tamerlane weapons are
precision-guided...

1220
01:35:53,080 --> 01:35:54,980
to minimize
collateral damage.

1221
01:35:55,916 --> 01:35:59,647
Not only is our technology the
most advanced in the world...

1222
01:35:59,787 --> 01:36:02,823
but also with a smart
missile system...

1223
01:36:02,858 --> 01:36:06,242
we can launch a matchstick
in Milwaukee...

1224
01:36:06,277 --> 01:36:09,626
and stick it up the ass
of termite in Tehran.

1225
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:27,274
Shit happens.

1226
01:36:37,057 --> 01:36:38,115
This blows.

1227
01:36:39,794 --> 01:36:42,888
"Killer, Whores and Jackals.
Behind Brand USA".

1228
01:36:42,997 --> 01:36:43,895
Good title, huh?

1229
01:36:43,964 --> 01:36:44,828
It's a little wordy.

1230
01:36:44,899 --> 01:36:45,991
Vehicle from the front!

1231
01:36:48,536 --> 01:36:50,026
All right, that's it! Hold it!

1232
01:36:53,874 --> 01:36:57,469
We are going to honeymoon.

1233
01:36:59,446 --> 01:37:01,846
Dude, it's the newlyweds!

1234
01:37:01,949 --> 01:37:02,779
Hey! Stand down!

1235
01:37:02,850 --> 01:37:07,412
Yonica, congratulations.
Your chariot's right this way.

1236
01:37:07,955 --> 01:37:08,853
Thank you.

1237
01:37:09,523 --> 01:37:12,287
- I have your poster on my wall.
- No, he's lyin'. It's my wall.

1238
01:37:12,827 --> 01:37:14,954
I used to... no. Bye.

1239
01:37:29,543 --> 01:37:30,771
Run, run, run.

1240
01:37:31,312 --> 01:37:32,279
Run, run, run.

1241
01:37:36,050 --> 01:37:37,881
I cannot fucking believe this.

1242
01:37:40,087 --> 01:37:44,023
Yonica, I know I saved you but I don't
want you putting me up on a pedestal.

1243
01:37:44,091 --> 01:37:45,820
I'm just a person, just a man.

1244
01:37:45,893 --> 01:37:47,326
Are you crazy? Where have you been?

1245
01:37:48,295 --> 01:37:51,025
- You are a fucking asshole, you know?
- Oh, I feel much better.

1246
01:37:51,932 --> 01:37:53,126
Go. Turn this thing on!

1247
01:37:58,672 --> 01:38:01,664
<i>So you don't want her to</i>
<i>be an assassin like you. </i>

1248
01:38:01,742 --> 01:38:04,233
<i>Well, don't worry because</i>
<i>I want to be like you. </i>

1249
01:38:04,311 --> 01:38:05,835
<i>- Yonica, don't be so sarcastic. </i>
<i>- I'm not. </i>

1250
01:38:07,715 --> 01:38:10,206
<i>- Where are we going?</i>
<i>- I don't know. </i>

1251
01:38:10,751 --> 01:38:12,082
<i>What do you mean, I don't know?</i>

1252
01:38:12,152 --> 01:38:13,854
<i>When I said I don't know,</i>
<i>it means I don't know. </i>

1253
01:38:13,889 --> 01:38:15,515
<i>- GuideStar!</i>
<i>- Welcome back, Mr. Hauser. </i>

1254
01:38:15,623 --> 01:38:17,614
<i>I can book you an hotel,</i>
<i>make you a dinner reservation. </i>

1255
01:38:17,725 --> 01:38:18,953
<i>You wanna just be spontaneous?</i>

1256
01:38:19,026 --> 01:38:22,325
<i>Spontaneous? It's Memorial Day</i>
<i>weekend, what if everything's full?</i>

1257
01:38:22,396 --> 01:38:24,296
<i>It's not gonna be full. </i>
<i>Jerry, am I right?</i>

1258
01:38:24,365 --> 01:38:25,923
<i>Don't get Jerry involved in this. </i>

1259
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:27,831
Would you two stop fighting?

1260
01:38:27,902 --> 01:38:29,733
We're not fighting.
We're just discussing.

1261
01:38:29,803 --> 01:38:31,703
<i>- It be sounding like fighting. </i>
<i>- Now she hates fighting. </i>

1262
01:38:31,772 --> 01:38:33,569
<i>Well, what do you expect?</i>
<i>Look at her father!</i>

1263
01:38:33,674 --> 01:38:35,699
This is the former vice
president speaking.

1264
01:38:35,776 --> 01:38:39,212
In response to the cowardly
and unprovoked terrorist...

1265
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:41,009
attack on the Emerald
City mall...

1266
01:38:41,081 --> 01:38:44,778
Tamerlane is pleased to announce
that it has been awarded the contract...

1267
01:38:44,852 --> 01:38:46,581
to preemptively strike Ugikistan...

1268
01:38:47,221 --> 01:38:49,746
which intelligence has
confirmed is behind this...

1269
01:38:49,823 --> 01:38:51,757
and hundreds of other
attacks in Turaqistan.

1270
01:38:52,293 --> 01:38:55,854
America cannot stand idly by and
allow hostile foreign powers...

1271
01:38:55,930 --> 01:38:57,761
to meddle in Turaqi affairs.

1272
01:38:58,165 --> 01:38:59,996
Intelligence has also conclusively stated...

1273
01:39:00,067 --> 01:39:03,434
that the Ugikis are developing
a nuclear arsenal...

1274
01:39:03,504 --> 01:39:07,167
and we cannot let the smoking gun come
in the form of a mushroom cloud.
