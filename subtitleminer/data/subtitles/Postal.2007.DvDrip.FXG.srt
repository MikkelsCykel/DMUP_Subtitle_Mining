1
00:00:13,212 --> 00:00:15,180
Tower two.

2
00:00:16,615 --> 00:00:18,450
Stand by.

3
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:25,590
That's affirmative.

4
00:00:25,658 --> 00:00:29,194
Congratulations, Nabi.

5
00:00:29,261 --> 00:00:31,930
We are at the doorstep
of our martyrdom.

6
00:00:31,997 --> 00:00:32,997
Praise Allah.

7
00:00:33,065 --> 00:00:34,299
Praise him!

8
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:38,737
Soon we will be greeted
by Allah, the one true god,

9
00:00:38,804 --> 00:00:41,373
and by the cheers
of our forefathers

10
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,442
and by 99 perfect virgins

11
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:46,978
who will worship us
for all eternity!

12
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:48,813
I thought it was 100.

13
00:00:48,881 --> 00:00:50,148
What's that?

14
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:52,450
100 virgins ...
they promised me 100.

15
00:00:52,518 --> 00:00:54,886
99, 100 ...
what's the difference?

16
00:00:54,954 --> 00:00:57,522
If they're telling you one thing
and they're telling me another,

17
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:58,757
maybe they don't know
for sure.

18
00:00:58,824 --> 00:01:00,592
Maybe.

19
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:03,661
Maybe the exact number
of virgins is not precise.

20
00:01:03,729 --> 00:01:05,697
I mean, if it's in the 90s,
I can live with that.

21
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:07,465
Or 75.

22
00:01:07,533 --> 00:01:10,101
Hey, I'm not greedy,
but what if it's 10?

23
00:01:11,437 --> 00:01:12,604
Well...

24
00:01:12,671 --> 00:01:16,007
What if it's 10, but we have
to split them between us?

25
00:01:16,075 --> 00:01:17,742
Then you'll have
five more virgins

26
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:19,377
than you have right now,
right?

27
00:01:19,445 --> 00:01:21,112
We're talking
about eternity here!

28
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,982
How long will five virgins
last you, maybe a month?

29
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:26,684
They're not going to be virgins
for long, right?

30
00:01:26,752 --> 00:01:29,554
Look, would it make
you feel better

31
00:01:29,622 --> 00:01:31,256
if we called the big guy?

32
00:01:31,323 --> 00:01:32,357
Yes.

33
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:34,192
Take the stick.
-Okay.

34
00:01:41,834 --> 00:01:43,301
It's ringing.

35
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:45,570
Osama, yes, it's Asif.

36
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:46,871
No, we're on it.

37
00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:50,308
It was fine, but security
takes forever, you know?

38
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:51,609
What are you going to do?

39
00:01:51,677 --> 00:01:53,445
Anyway, look,
Nabi has a question.

40
00:01:53,512 --> 00:01:54,446
Will you talk to him?

41
00:01:54,513 --> 00:01:55,447
No!

42
00:01:57,216 --> 00:01:58,717
You do it!

43
00:02:00,352 --> 00:02:02,487
Hello!

44
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:04,322
Yes.

45
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:07,258
Uh, it's about the virgins.

46
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:10,361
Really?

47
00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:12,797
It was 100 when I signed up.

48
00:02:14,633 --> 00:02:16,835
He said
it's not that many anymore.

49
00:02:16,902 --> 00:02:18,970
Too many martyrs
in the first go-around.

50
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:21,106
You've got to be kidding me.
Does he know where we are here?

51
00:02:21,173 --> 00:02:22,107
Give me the phone.

52
00:02:22,174 --> 00:02:24,442
Take the stick.

53
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,244
Osama, it's Asif.

54
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:30,548
Right now, can you tell me
the number, absolutely,

55
00:02:30,616 --> 00:02:32,617
that you can guarantee
Nabi and myself,

56
00:02:32,685 --> 00:02:35,120
as far
as virgins are concerned?

57
00:02:37,156 --> 00:02:39,657
No, that's fine.

58
00:02:39,725 --> 00:02:41,059
Do it!

59
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:42,694
Come on, man!

60
00:02:42,762 --> 00:02:45,196
He can't guarantee
more than 20.

61
00:02:45,264 --> 00:02:48,199
Open the goddamn door,
you bastards!

62
00:02:48,267 --> 00:02:50,168
We're gonna fucking
kill you, you motherfucker!

63
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:51,302
Lying pieces of shit!

64
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:53,505
Open the door!
-Open this fucker!

65
00:02:53,572 --> 00:02:55,006
Screw this, right?

66
00:02:55,074 --> 00:02:56,207
I'm glad you said it first.

67
00:02:56,275 --> 00:02:58,410
Okay, get on the intercom
to the passengers.

68
00:02:58,477 --> 00:03:00,612
We are changing course
for the Bahamas.

69
00:03:00,679 --> 00:03:02,614
Bahamas!

70
00:03:02,681 --> 00:03:03,982
Aah!

71
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:08,420
We're going to the Bahamas!

72
00:03:12,758 --> 00:03:17,128
Aah!

73
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:49,761

I can't hear my show.

Yeah,
nothing's good on anyway.

93
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:32,971
Just, uh, preparing
for my interview.

94
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:34,105
Fight!

95
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:36,775
Aw, you fight like a pussy.

96
00:04:36,842 --> 00:04:38,710
No one's gonna hire
your sorry ass.

97
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:41,012
Why don't you go suck up
to your Uncle Dave already?

98
00:04:45,851 --> 00:04:47,252
God damn it!

99
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:49,821
What the hell
is going on out there?!

100
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:51,656
Ugh.

101
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:53,058
Nothing.

102
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:55,527
Make sure you pick up
that welfare check!

103
00:04:55,594 --> 00:04:58,797
Kiss, kiss,
sweetie pie...

104
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:02,400
Come on!

105
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,235
Come on!

106
00:05:04,303 --> 00:05:05,236
No.

107
00:05:05,304 --> 00:05:07,172
Bad boy.
Bad boy.

108
00:05:07,239 --> 00:05:08,873
I told you ...
no poopies in our yard.

109
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:10,141
No poopies in this yard.

110
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:12,610
You only poop in
the next-door neighbor's yard.

111
00:05:15,614 --> 00:05:17,849
Feces in the yard.

112
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:19,918
That's a violation

113
00:05:19,985 --> 00:05:23,021
of trailer-park
ordinance number 101-40.

114
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:24,289
Stop eating the poop.

115
00:05:24,356 --> 00:05:25,690
I'll add that to the list.

116
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:26,791
Th-the list?

117
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:28,259
The list. Great. The list.
W-what else?

118
00:05:28,327 --> 00:05:29,961
What else
you got on the list?

119
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:33,098
Ordinance number 143-11.

120
00:05:33,165 --> 00:05:35,300
Yesterday around lunchtime.

121
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:37,836
Now, I don't care what you two
do in your own bedroom,

122
00:05:37,903 --> 00:05:40,405
but ordinance number 143-11

123
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:43,708
says if I hear your lewd
lovemaking after 10:00 a.M.,

124
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:45,810
I get to file a grievance
against your sorry ass,

125
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:47,712
which is
exactly what I'm gonna do!

126
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,948
Oh. Oh.
-Oh, okay.

127
00:05:50,015 --> 00:05:52,784
Well, at least I wasn't boning
my sister, you inbred hick.

128
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:55,854
Oh, for your information,
hillbilly,

129
00:05:55,921 --> 00:05:58,823
I wasn't even here
yesterday afternoon.

130
00:06:06,031 --> 00:06:07,332
I hate this town.

131
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,234
Matt!
-Whatever!

132
00:06:09,301 --> 00:06:10,702
This fucking sucks.

133
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,003
And NASA,

134
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:15,173
The National Aeronautics
and Space Administration,

135
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:17,275
does not exist.

136
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,878
All the space missions
that we've heard about

137
00:06:19,945 --> 00:06:22,113
since we were little kids
in school ...

138
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:24,149
creations of Hollywood.

139
00:06:24,216 --> 00:06:25,984
We did not land on the moon.

140
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,219
There is no John Glenn.

141
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:31,056
Well, there's a John Glenn
who's a Senator...

142
00:06:31,123 --> 00:06:32,424
Hey, hello?

143
00:06:32,491 --> 00:06:33,491
You, professor.

144
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,026
What is this,
a reading library?

145
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:36,327
Yeah, yeah.
Two minutes, buddy.

146
00:06:36,395 --> 00:06:37,962
Ah, no "two minutes" now.

147
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,064
You buy now, or bye-bye.

148
00:06:39,131 --> 00:06:40,365
Bye-dee now now.

149
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:42,267
Ah, go on, bye-bye.
Go on.

150
00:06:42,334 --> 00:06:43,435
Bye-bye.
You bye-bye.

151
00:06:43,502 --> 00:06:44,536
Goodbye. Goodbye.
-Hey.

152
00:06:44,603 --> 00:06:46,404
Don't let the door
hit you on the way out.

153
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:50,275
Daddy, Mohammed says he needs
to talk to you again.

154
00:06:50,342 --> 00:06:51,276
What about?

155
00:06:51,343 --> 00:06:52,610
What else?

156
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:56,081
Okay, so, what did she say
about me exactly?

157
00:06:56,148 --> 00:06:57,782
That slut.

158
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,784
# killer, yeah,
and rhyme till I die #

159
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:01,953
# with an AK-47
from side to side #

160
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:03,054
# jihad killers #

161
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:04,355
# man, it's hot in here #

162
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:06,758
# you just to stake that
out of this atmosphere #

163
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:07,926
# jihad killers #

164
00:07:07,993 --> 00:07:10,195
My brother.

165
00:07:10,262 --> 00:07:12,430
Any police come around today?
Anything suspicious?

166
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:14,232
No, nothing, Mohammed.

167
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,533
Trust me...

168
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:18,370
you are safely hidden here
for as long as you want.

169
00:07:18,437 --> 00:07:21,433
Well, that may not
be for much longer.

170
00:07:21,434 --> 00:07:21,740
Oh?

171
00:07:21,807 --> 00:07:24,209
We have news
from Afghanistan.

172
00:07:24,276 --> 00:07:26,344
News? Oh.

173
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:28,313
It is all coming together.

174
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:31,449
The shipment
left three days ago.

175
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:32,851
Oh.

176
00:07:32,918 --> 00:07:35,053
Praise Allah.

177
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,621
When, uh, will be it here?

178
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:38,256
Tomorrow!

179
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:43,428
The time has come for us
to place our swords

180
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:46,698
to the genitals
of the infidels.

181
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,901
Whoo-hoo!

182
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:10,922
Gah.

183
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:16,094
I see
you noticed the heads ...

184
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,796
motivational.

185
00:08:17,863 --> 00:08:19,364
Those are
every fucking bastard

186
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:22,434
that I had to climb over
to get this job.

187
00:08:22,501 --> 00:08:23,968
Jesus.

188
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:28,173
Foul.
They're paper-mache.

189
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,774
They're ...
he thought they were real.

190
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:32,277
Sit down.

191
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,380
Let's get started.

192
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:38,249
So, I hope you don't mi ...

193
00:08:39,618 --> 00:08:41,486
I hope you don't mind
the recording.

194
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:45,056
Uh, we're gonna use it
as training later.

195
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:46,357
Ready?

196
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:49,027
Uh, yeah, yeah.
It's good.

197
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:51,396
What the fuck is wrong
with you?

198
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:53,398
It's, uh ...
the chair is actually ...

199
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:54,632
All right,
we're on a time clock,

200
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,501
So let's get started,
shall we?

201
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:57,869
Yes, sir.

202
00:08:57,937 --> 00:08:59,471
Good.

203
00:08:59,538 --> 00:09:01,005
Well...

204
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:04,075
Um, so, I'm here
for the job, sir.

205
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:06,244
Right.
You're a factory worker.

206
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:07,512
I was.

207
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,582
I was a factory worker, but
the factory got closed down,

208
00:09:10,649 --> 00:09:12,751
so I got laid off, and ...

209
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:14,853
I've interviewed 15 other people
for this job.

210
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,721
What makes you think
you're better than them?

211
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:18,523
Well, I don't know
if I am better than them.

212
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,824
Well, god damn it, pal.

213
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,926
If you want this job, you better
reach out and grab it.

214
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:23,995
You better put
those fucking heads on the wall.

215
00:09:26,031 --> 00:09:28,033
You know what? Fuck it.
Let's go to the questions.

216
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,468
What is
your greatest strength?

217
00:09:30,536 --> 00:09:31,569
Um...

218
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:34,506
I'm a really good team player.

219
00:09:34,573 --> 00:09:36,241
Wrong.

220
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:40,412
What is
your biggest weakness?

221
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:43,381
Um, I'd say I work too hard.

222
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:45,283
Wrong.

223
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:48,263
How would you move a
mountain using only a spoon?

224
00:09:48,264 --> 00:09:48,787
A spoon?

225
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:51,356
If you were in a box,
how would you think outside it?

226
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,391
Uh, it's ...
well, if you're in a ...

227
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:55,093
Wrong.

228
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:57,195
Last question ...

229
00:09:57,263 --> 00:10:00,532
What is
the difference between a duck?

230
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:07,372
And?

231
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:18,283
What the hell
is wrong with you people?!

232
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:19,718
A d...a wh... duck?

233
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:22,821
I don't ...
I came here for a job, a job!

234
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:24,355
As far as I know, that job

235
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:27,625
has nothing to do with a
cocksucking, motherfucking duck!

236
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:33,398
Congratulations, pal.

237
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,433
You're
our leading candidate.

238
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:37,602
How does it feel?

239
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,339
It feels good.

240
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:43,842
No, no, no, no, no.
How's it feel?

241
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:45,810
How does it feel?

242
00:10:45,878 --> 00:10:46,845
I mean, how does it feel

243
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:48,980
to put fucking 15 heads
on that wall?

244
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:50,115
I'll tell you how it feels.

245
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:51,649
It feels fucking great,
doesn't it?

246
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:55,720
Fucking great, like, unh,
unh, unh, unh, unh, unh...

247
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:58,022
So, I got it?
I got the job?

248
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,391
Oh, hell, no.
No, no, no.

249
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:01,159
This was just a like
a getting-to-know-you interview.

250
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:04,229
Oh, yeah, no, no, we have ...
we have a couple of more ... 120.

251
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:07,198
Yeah, we have some, uh, more ...
more candidates to talk to.

252
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:09,801
But hell of a start, though.
-Absolutely.

253
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:13,004
Last thing before you go ...

254
00:11:13,072 --> 00:11:15,306
I'd like you to sing
the company fight song.

255
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,852
# it's not a flag,
it's a company #

256
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,454
# a high-flying company #

257
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:32,590
# and it will cheerfully
work you to death #

258
00:11:32,658 --> 00:11:36,528
# by the time you are old,
the pension is sold #

259
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:39,831
# and your cube
will be your casket #

260
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:43,201
# it's a company,
a high-flying company #

261
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:46,905
# now please get back to work #

262
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:50,108
We'll get back to you.

263
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:58,316
I hate this town.

264
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:04,255
# change has begun #

265
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:05,790
# ah, ah #

266
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:08,993
# spread the word today #

267
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:11,396
# ah, ah, ah, ah #

268
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:15,300
# follow the flower children #

269
00:12:15,368 --> 00:12:18,036
# let them lead the way #

270
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:21,172
Brothers and sisters...

271
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:26,945
I am proud
to introduce to you the one.

272
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:33,318
Hold up your energies
for Uncle Dave!

273
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:39,724
Good group, good group.

274
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:45,764
Welcome to the Denomination
of Organic Monotheism.

275
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:50,068
I congratulate you all on taking
the first step to freedom

276
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:52,570
by completing
your training program.

277
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:56,341
Obviously, you've come
to the correct conclusion

278
00:12:56,409 --> 00:13:00,178
that the American dream
is not a dream for you.

279
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:01,413
That's right!

280
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,415
In fact...

281
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:05,050
it is a nightmare...

282
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:09,387
yeah!

283
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,891
...a nightmare that soon
will be engulfed

284
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:17,495
in the all-encompassing flames
of God's damnation!

285
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:20,532
Yeah!

286
00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:24,335
Pious people in the house,
say, "oh!"

287
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:26,004
-Oh!
-Oh! -Oh!

288
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:27,739
Who loves God?

289
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,507
We do!
-We do! -We do!

290
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:32,510
David?

291
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:33,578
Huh?

292
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:37,782
Oh, yeah.
Initiation.

293
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,217
I love this part.

294
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:41,553
No, no, Richie, no, no,
this is...

295
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:44,522
this is just ... this
is just inner-sanctum stuff,

296
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:45,890
strictly ritualistic.

297
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:48,259
Uh, Uncle Dave, uh,
sorry to bother you,

298
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:52,163
but we've got some rather
important business.

299
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:54,666
The girls ...
they need to go.

300
00:13:54,734 --> 00:13:55,800
Oh!

301
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:57,635
Mm. Okay.

302
00:13:57,703 --> 00:14:00,638
Children, it appears
that Brother Richard here

303
00:14:00,706 --> 00:14:04,709
has to, uh, commingle
our ... our energies.

304
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:05,844
Sweetie ... sweetie ...

305
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:07,212
Let's go.
Come on, ladies, move.

306
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:09,881
There we go.

307
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:11,649
But I want more communion.
-Wa-kah!

308
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:13,251
Oh, we'll do communion,
I promise.

309
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:14,786
It's my favorite meal
of the day.

310
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,454
Don't worry about it.
-That's nice.

311
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:19,724
Now go.
-Oh, hello.

312
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:22,127
God bless it.

313
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:24,596
Ah, Richie, what the fuck is it?
What's the problem?

314
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:27,165
We're having something

315
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:29,367
of a cash-flow problem.

316
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:31,503
What the fuck
you talking about, Richie?

317
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,371
Did you see all those recruits
out there today?

318
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:34,506
It's true.

319
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:36,908
Membership and donations
are at an all-time high,

320
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:39,310
and we got more tail running
around here than the ...

321
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,546
than the Playboy Mansion,
but it's ...

322
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:46,418
Yeah? So?
Then what's the problem, Rich?

323
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:47,685
Well...

324
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:50,288
...it's the IRS.

325
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:51,823
Yeah?
Well, what do they want?

326
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:55,226
Uh, it seems we haven't paid
our taxes in three years.

327
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:57,562
So what, man?

328
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,197
I tried to explain,
of course,

329
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:01,366
that with our continued expectation
of the end of the world,

330
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:03,401
it's difficult
to justify contributing

331
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:06,571
to long-term programs like
Medicare or Social Security,

332
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,673
but, um...

333
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:13,578
...apparently even
a selective tax payment

334
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:14,879
is not an option.

335
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:17,082
Oh, come on, Richie, you know
I don't like to micromanage.

336
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:18,883
What the fuck do we do
about this, all right?

337
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:20,285
Well...
-Huh?

338
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:21,953
What's your plan?

339
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:26,391
We pay them or, uh ...

340
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:29,260
Ohh!

341
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:33,264
We pay them,
or everything is all over ...

342
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:35,467
the weenie whacking,
the pantless parties,

343
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:37,202
the tacos, everything.

344
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:40,305
And you...
you go to jail.

345
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:43,274
So, how much do we owe?

346
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:44,909
Mm...

347
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:53,785
$1.3 million and 79 cents.

348
00:15:53,853 --> 00:15:56,521
Oh, fuck, Rich.

349
00:15:56,589 --> 00:15:59,991
Oh, d-d-don't despair,
Uncle Dave.

350
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:04,129
When the government
slams the doors shut,

351
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:08,833
G-O-D always opens
a window.

352
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:10,735
Oh.

353
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:15,173
That's a beautifully
retarded sentiment, Richie.

354
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:18,643
Now, if you don't mind,
I'd like to be alone.

355
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,550
Well, if you need me,
I'm in the other room.

356
00:16:25,618 --> 00:16:28,520
It seems
pretty unlikely, Rich.

357
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:31,623
<i>Unfortunately, the supply of Krotchy
dolls can't meet the demand,</i>

358
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,272
<i>And parents and
children alike have been</i>

359
00:16:33,273 --> 00:16:34,926

See you then.</i>

362
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:41,633

00:16:44,437 --> 00:16:46,004
Hey, yo, hi.

365
00:16:46,072 --> 00:16:48,306
Come here.
Help me out with a few bucks.

366
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:50,775
Yeah, I ... I don't have
any money.

367
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,143
Come on.
Come on, I'm serious.

368
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:53,445
Come over here.

369
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:56,014
I need a few bucks to get a bus
to go see my kids.

370
00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:57,649
I ... yo, I don't have ...

371
00:16:57,717 --> 00:16:59,284
sorry, I don't have any money.
-Hey, come here.

372
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:02,020
Come here.
I want to talk ... come here.

373
00:17:02,088 --> 00:17:03,555
Get the fuck out of here.

374
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:05,690
I'm sick and tired
of people like you, you know?

375
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:08,193
You got a good job.
You got a big car.

376
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,661
You got everything,
and I got nothing.

377
00:17:09,729 --> 00:17:10,762
Well, fuck you,

378
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:12,997
And fuck everybody
who even looks like you!

379
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:14,699
Get the fuck out of here!

380
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:16,601
# brace yourself #

381
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:18,503
I'll fucking knock you out, pal.

382
00:17:18,571 --> 00:17:20,305
# just to see how it feels #

383
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:25,477
It's green.

384
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,312
Look, you can make the light!

385
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,214
Hey!

386
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:31,082
Oh.

387
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:34,819
You can make the light!

388
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,855
Come on, bitch!

389
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:38,089
God damn.

390
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:39,557
She could have made
the fucking light.

391
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,226
She forget her glass.

392
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:43,061
You say "glass"?
-Yes.

393
00:17:43,129 --> 00:17:46,231
You say "glass," you
frankfurt-eating motherfucker?

394
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:47,866
I bought all these goddamn English CDs

395
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:49,334
For you
to say fucking "glass"?

396
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:50,535
It's "glasses."

397
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:52,037
You fucking foreigners
come over here,

398
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:53,171
and you fuck up
the language,

399
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:55,373
and this bitch
is fucking up the traffic!

400
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:56,374
Come down, Greg.

401
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:57,442
You fucking calm down!

402
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,010
This flat-ass bitch
comes over here,

403
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,278
she takes over
the convenience stores,

404
00:18:00,346 --> 00:18:02,514
and they eat up
all our goddamn dogs!

405
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:04,616
Go and help her.
Come on.

406
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:07,052
What's the holdup?!

407
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:08,420
You're right.

408
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:10,622
I'm trippin'.

409
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:13,792
I'll just get out of the car
and make sure she's doing okay.

410
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:16,528
She's an old lady.

411
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:17,562
I feel bad now.

412
00:18:23,703 --> 00:18:25,437
Hi.
The light is green.

413
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:28,273
The light is green.

414
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,742
You could have
went through the light.

415
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,610
The light turned gr ...
what did you say?

416
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:35,280
What'd you say, bitch?

417
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:36,414
Aah!

418
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:38,883
Why don't you stir-fry that?

419
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:42,854
Holy fuck!

420
00:18:42,922 --> 00:18:43,922
Damn!

421
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:46,191
Yeah, that'll get her moving!

422
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,361
Man.

423
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:51,730
What happened over there?

424
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,865
Bitch called me nigger.

425
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:03,842
Ooh.

426
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:05,777
Whoa-ho-ho!
Did you see that?

427
00:19:05,845 --> 00:19:07,746
Yeah.

428
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,347
One date with me,

429
00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:12,450
she'll look like she's been hit
with a mayonnaise truck.

430
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:15,286
That's right, Mr. Stickum.

431
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:19,124
Yeah, I hope she comes back.

432
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:20,658
You got to hold it.

433
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:22,127
Thank you.

434
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:23,161
Okay.

435
00:19:23,229 --> 00:19:24,262
All set?
-Yes.

436
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:27,699
What do you got?
-I will have a medium...

437
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:33,204
No, you know what?
I'm gonna have a large.

438
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:35,540
I'll have a large mocha.

439
00:19:35,608 --> 00:19:36,708
Okay.

440
00:19:36,776 --> 00:19:37,942
No.

441
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:41,046
No, you know what?
Maybe a ... maybe a vanilla.

442
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:42,514
Okay.

443
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:44,983
W-w-what do you think
goes better with bagels?

444
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:46,184
Unh!

445
00:19:46,252 --> 00:19:49,888
You had 10 minutes
to make up your fucking mind!

446
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:52,123
What is it with you people?
Can somebody please tell me?

447
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,626
I mean, we sell coffee.
That's it, nothing else.

448
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:55,960
You're not buying a car,
I mean, right?

449
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,796
Make a fucking decision, huh?
How about it?

450
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,197
I know.
Here we go.

451
00:19:59,265 --> 00:20:02,233
You're gonna have
a regular coffee.

452
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:05,870
Careful ... the beverage you're
about to enjoy is extremely hot.

453
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:06,871
Next?

454
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:08,640
Uh...

455
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,408
What?

456
00:20:10,476 --> 00:20:11,943
I, um ...

457
00:20:12,011 --> 00:20:15,246
Two lattes,
no foam, please.

458
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,298
I can't believe
this is the first time

459
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:34,366
you've ever been here.

460
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:36,234
Huh.

461
00:20:36,302 --> 00:20:38,670
I mean, all these fucking idiots
calling me Uncle Dave,

462
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:40,772
And here I am ...
I actually am your Uncle Dave.

463
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,607
Yeah.

464
00:20:42,675 --> 00:20:46,044
So, when was the last time
I saw you?

465
00:20:46,112 --> 00:20:48,947
The bachelor party,
right before the wedding night.

466
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:51,383
Oh, fuck, yeah, right.
That was fun.

467
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,451
I wonder
if that donkey survived.

468
00:20:55,054 --> 00:20:57,722
Well, what do you think
of the place?

469
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:00,892
Ah, it's ... it's amazing.

470
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,094
Yeah. I kind of owe it
all to you, you know?

471
00:21:03,162 --> 00:21:04,763
Me?

472
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,998
Well, we always talked

473
00:21:07,066 --> 00:21:08,900
about running a con like this, right?
-Yeah.

474
00:21:08,968 --> 00:21:11,002
You know,
about how gullible people are,

475
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,337
how they'll believe anything

476
00:21:12,405 --> 00:21:14,539
if you just tell it to them
a couple of times?

477
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:17,909
Anyway, I just took all that
talk, put it into action,

478
00:21:17,977 --> 00:21:20,712
pushed it to the next level,
and...

479
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,314
here I fucking am.

480
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:25,116
Man.

481
00:21:25,184 --> 00:21:27,752
I just can't believe it,
you know?

482
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,655
Yeah.

483
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:36,294
You know, it's funny you showing
up here like this, you know,

484
00:21:36,362 --> 00:21:39,864
'cause I find myself in a ...
in a financial situation.

485
00:21:39,932 --> 00:21:42,333
And I have a plan
for getting out of it,

486
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:43,868
But I could use a partner.

487
00:21:43,936 --> 00:21:45,470
Uh, no.
No, no, no.

488
00:21:45,538 --> 00:21:47,305
I know where this is going,
Uncle Dave.

489
00:21:47,373 --> 00:21:50,275
I ... I don't do
that type of shit anymore.

490
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:52,377
Come on,
it'd be like old times.

491
00:21:52,445 --> 00:21:55,547
Remember when we stole the flag
from the Governor's Mansion?

492
00:21:55,614 --> 00:21:56,948
Twice.

493
00:21:57,016 --> 00:21:58,149
Yeah.

494
00:21:58,217 --> 00:22:00,385
And this plan
is foolproof, man.

495
00:22:00,453 --> 00:22:02,587
I got arrested
the second time.

496
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:04,723
<i>Well, that plan
wasn't foolproof.</i>

497
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,858
Yeah, they prosecuted me

498
00:22:06,926 --> 00:22:09,327
under the new flag protection amendment,

499
00:22:09,395 --> 00:22:10,762
and with that on my record,

500
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:14,332
I couldn't get into a good
college or get a good job or ...

501
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,768
I pretty much just play
by the rules.

502
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:19,604
Look, man, nobody plays
by the rules, all right?

503
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:21,639
You bend them,
or you break them.

504
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:24,142
Anything else
is just slow death.

505
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:25,677
Yeah,
that's what it feels like.

506
00:22:25,745 --> 00:22:26,678
Yeah.

507
00:22:26,746 --> 00:22:27,912
All right,
well, fuck it, man.

508
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,447
I never push you
to do anything, right?

509
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:31,116
I always let you go your own way.
-Yeah.

510
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,218
Besides, it's working out great
for you, right?

511
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:36,654
I mean, you got the beautiful
wife, the nice home.

512
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:40,692
If you change your mind, though,
you let me know.

513
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,762
Here,
have a souvenir ashtray.

514
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:45,430
Thanks.

515
00:22:46,399 --> 00:22:49,708
Now, you're gonna get a
welfare check for $168, right?

516
00:22:49,709 --> 00:22:50,535
Fuck you, man.

517
00:22:50,603 --> 00:22:51,636
You give me that check,

518
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:53,738
I'll give you $250 worth
of food stamps.

519
00:22:53,806 --> 00:22:55,907
You understand what I'm saying?
Major profit there.

520
00:22:55,975 --> 00:22:58,376
This is a good deal, pal.
It's a fucking great deal.

521
00:22:58,444 --> 00:22:59,411
Shit.

522
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:00,678
That's $82.

523
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:02,147
$82. You're good at math.

524
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,214
Hey, that's you.
You're next.

525
00:23:03,282 --> 00:23:04,315
Here, use my pen.

526
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:06,551
Use my pen
and don't forget to date it.

527
00:23:06,619 --> 00:23:09,020
23-6.

528
00:23:09,088 --> 00:23:11,189
Hey, have you heard
that since the United States

529
00:23:11,257 --> 00:23:13,658
has closed their borders they're
getting rid of the Statue of Liberty?

530
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:14,893
I don't understand you.

531
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,829
All that scrap copper's
gonna be for sale.

532
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:19,731
I don't want copper!
You go away!

533
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:20,799
Wrong form.

534
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:21,833
What?!

535
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:23,101
Wrong form!

536
00:23:23,169 --> 00:23:25,770
Look, I don't care
what form I have, all right?!

537
00:23:25,838 --> 00:23:27,338
I'm not leaving here
until I get my money!

538
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:29,074
Buddy, come on.
Hey, buddy, let's go.

539
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:30,108
Come on.

540
00:23:30,176 --> 00:23:31,609
Where's the pen?
Where's my pen?

541
00:23:31,677 --> 00:23:34,212
Hey, come here.
He's got my pen.

542
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,613
Hey! Hey!

543
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:38,750
Down! Down!
Shit!

544
00:23:50,963 --> 00:23:52,797
Fuck me!

545
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:56,868
Help me!

546
00:23:58,104 --> 00:24:00,572
Ugh!

547
00:24:01,674 --> 00:24:02,607
Aah!

548
00:24:02,675 --> 00:24:03,608
Oh, my god!

549
00:24:03,676 --> 00:24:05,410
Just get down!
Get down!

550
00:24:06,979 --> 00:24:08,480
That does it!

551
00:24:09,482 --> 00:24:12,117
Don't do it!
Don't do it!

552
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:13,952
Don't do it!
Don't do it!

553
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:15,420
Don't do it!

554
00:24:18,858 --> 00:24:20,992
I need backup!
Unh! Unh!

555
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:31,102
Sweet.

556
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:37,042
Aah!

557
00:24:37,109 --> 00:24:39,177
More fucking backup!

558
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:41,746
Number 25!

559
00:24:43,516 --> 00:24:44,449
Right here.

560
00:24:44,517 --> 00:24:47,085
Here.
Right here.

561
00:24:47,153 --> 00:24:48,820
Sorry, we're closed.

562
00:24:48,888 --> 00:24:50,889
My baby!

563
00:24:52,892 --> 00:24:55,527
Ha! Unh!

564
00:24:55,594 --> 00:24:56,528
Unh!

565
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:59,497
Unh! Oof!

566
00:25:01,767 --> 00:25:04,769
Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!

567
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:07,605
Oh!

568
00:25:08,708 --> 00:25:11,342
Oh, yes!

569
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:13,712
Come on!

570
00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:15,613
Give it to me, daddy.

571
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:17,849
Give it to your bad girl.

572
00:25:22,755 --> 00:25:24,889
Oh, yes!
Give it to me!

573
00:25:24,957 --> 00:25:26,057
Oh!

574
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:27,859
Oh, yes!

575
00:25:34,433 --> 00:25:37,502
I'll be back in a second,
sweet cheeks.

576
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,813
Hi, neighbor.

577
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:53,184
Guess I won't be needing
that grievance after all, huh?

578
00:25:53,252 --> 00:25:55,353
Okay.

579
00:25:55,421 --> 00:25:57,188
# love #

580
00:25:57,256 --> 00:25:58,590
# I'm sucker for love #

581
00:25:58,657 --> 00:26:03,294
# your love is a love
that I can't get enough of #

582
00:26:03,362 --> 00:26:05,930
# I'm a sucker for love,
your love #

583
00:26:05,998 --> 00:26:08,233
Got to find the wet spot.

584
00:26:17,276 --> 00:26:19,878
Leave the welfare check
on the counter.

585
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:21,413
Oh, yeah.

586
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,947
There. Oh, yeah.

587
00:26:23,015 --> 00:26:24,983
Oh!

588
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:30,288
Give it to me, you stud.

589
00:26:30,356 --> 00:26:31,356
Yes.

590
00:26:31,424 --> 00:26:33,691
Oh!
Oh, yeah!

591
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:35,760
Yes!

592
00:26:37,129 --> 00:26:40,065
Get me a large bottle
of cooking oil.

593
00:26:40,132 --> 00:26:42,934
The extra-virgin kind!

594
00:26:43,002 --> 00:26:45,303
Oh, yes!
Yes!

595
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:50,008
Oh, yes!

596
00:26:50,076 --> 00:26:51,810
Oh!

597
00:26:51,877 --> 00:26:55,113
Please, Uncle Dave, please,
just a few hundred bucks,

598
00:26:55,181 --> 00:26:58,450
just ... just enough to get me
out of this fuckhole town

599
00:26:58,517 --> 00:27:00,518
for the rest
of my life, please?

600
00:27:00,586 --> 00:27:02,353
Hey, sport.

601
00:27:02,421 --> 00:27:03,722
Last chance.
Come on.

602
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:05,256
Help me out with a few bucks.

603
00:27:05,324 --> 00:27:08,727
I don't have anything.

604
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:11,563
Who the fuck do you think
you're talking to, huh?

605
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,566
What, do you think I'm stupid
or something, huh?

606
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:18,103
Listen, you're not gonna help me
out, I'll help out myself.

607
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:19,671
Open up the wallet.

608
00:27:19,739 --> 00:27:21,906
Dude, who you talking to?

609
00:27:23,242 --> 00:27:24,442
No.

610
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:26,845
Let go of my gun.
What's the matter with you?

611
00:27:26,912 --> 00:27:28,079
Bro, you still there?

612
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,082
Hey, bro?

613
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,351
Hey, while I got you,
I got to ask you ...

614
00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:36,821
What do you think of those ...
those mileage rewards programs?

615
00:27:36,889 --> 00:27:39,391
What's the matter with you? Let go.
-No!

616
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:41,726
You know, I thought you could
use those miles anytime

617
00:27:41,794 --> 00:27:43,161
To get tickets, right?

618
00:27:43,229 --> 00:27:46,331
But, you know, I tried, and
you can't use them at Christmas.

619
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:48,466
Last chance.
-No.

620
00:27:48,534 --> 00:27:50,035
Give me the gun!
-No.

621
00:27:52,938 --> 00:27:55,273
Aw, shit, sport.

622
00:28:01,313 --> 00:28:02,881
It's like at every holiday
it's blacked out.

623
00:28:02,948 --> 00:28:05,283
Like, anytime you want to use the
fucking thing, it's blacked out.

624
00:28:05,351 --> 00:28:07,619
That's bullshit, isn't it?

625
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,154
Dave?
-Yeah?

626
00:28:09,221 --> 00:28:10,221
I'm in.

627
00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:11,623
You are?

628
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,558
Oh, fuck,
that's great, man.

629
00:28:16,562 --> 00:28:18,096
But you know what?

630
00:28:18,164 --> 00:28:21,466
You caught me at kind of
a busy time right now, so, uh...

631
00:28:22,735 --> 00:28:24,669
We, the people under Allah,

632
00:28:24,737 --> 00:28:26,571
give you a new beacon
of strength

633
00:28:26,639 --> 00:28:29,107
against the great Satan
of the West.

634
00:28:29,175 --> 00:28:31,443
They believe we are weakened,

635
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:32,911
but in only a few days,

636
00:28:32,978 --> 00:28:36,514
we will strike a blow against
America so swift and terrible

637
00:28:36,582 --> 00:28:40,051
that the evil ones will collapse
once and for all.

638
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:42,754
We are asking those
of the true faith

639
00:28:42,822 --> 00:28:44,656
to wait, pray,

640
00:28:44,724 --> 00:28:49,327
and praise Allah when
the glorious slaughter begins.

641
00:28:49,395 --> 00:28:52,697
And cut!

642
00:28:52,765 --> 00:28:55,533
Wonderful scene, Sammy.
Just wonderful!

643
00:28:55,601 --> 00:28:57,202
You truly outdid yourself
this time.

644
00:28:57,269 --> 00:28:59,003
You ... you hold the screen.

645
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:01,539
You ... you are forceful,
yet unbelievable.

646
00:29:01,607 --> 00:29:03,074
I almost cried
in the middle there.

647
00:29:03,142 --> 00:29:04,609
You have
such a ... a star quality.

648
00:29:04,677 --> 00:29:06,845
You can't put it into words.
You are a true superstar.

649
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:07,912
Your voice...

650
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,180
Your eyes ...
they were popping.

651
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:10,749
What?

652
00:29:10,816 --> 00:29:12,751
Don't you know
I'm lactose intolerant?

653
00:29:12,818 --> 00:29:14,686
Are you trying to kill me?

654
00:29:16,188 --> 00:29:18,556
Who writes this shit?

655
00:29:20,292 --> 00:29:22,260
They're not listening anymore,
Mohammed.

656
00:29:22,328 --> 00:29:24,396
I tell them
about Allah and glory.

657
00:29:24,463 --> 00:29:27,198
And what do I get?
What do I get every damn time?

658
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:28,533
Virgins.

659
00:29:28,601 --> 00:29:30,101
Ding ding ding
ding ding ding.

660
00:29:30,169 --> 00:29:33,738
Nobody wants to die anymore
unless they get virgins.

661
00:29:33,806 --> 00:29:36,207
But no one has to die
this time.

662
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:39,310
That is genius
of the shipment.

663
00:29:39,378 --> 00:29:40,945
Ooh, the shipment!

664
00:29:41,013 --> 00:29:43,214
Ooh, big whoop!

665
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:45,517
What is it this time ...
more Anthrax?

666
00:29:47,153 --> 00:29:49,487
Sammy, sammy...

667
00:29:49,555 --> 00:29:51,056
Why do you have
to be like that?

668
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:53,591
Remember the thing with
the planes a few years back?

669
00:29:53,659 --> 00:29:55,293
Do you remember that, hmm?

670
00:29:55,361 --> 00:29:57,896
Do you remember that?
Come on, do you remember that?

671
00:29:57,963 --> 00:29:59,030
Child's play!

672
00:29:59,098 --> 00:30:02,200
Tomorrow is
when we really make our mark ...

673
00:30:02,268 --> 00:30:03,668
you, me...

674
00:30:03,736 --> 00:30:07,972
and the shipment
of Krotchy dolls.

675
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:11,276
I'm gonna go watch "Oprah."

676
00:30:11,343 --> 00:30:13,611
She's looking good
these days.

677
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:15,480
The diet is working.

678
00:30:15,548 --> 00:30:18,316
I will do anything it takes to
get the fuck out of Paradise ...

679
00:30:18,384 --> 00:30:20,852
anything, anything!

680
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,020
Okay.

681
00:30:22,088 --> 00:30:25,323
Take me up the ass.

682
00:30:27,093 --> 00:30:29,094
Just kidding.

683
00:30:30,262 --> 00:30:32,764
No, no, here, here.

684
00:30:32,832 --> 00:30:34,999
You know these things?

685
00:30:35,067 --> 00:30:37,435
Krotchy dolls?
-Yeah.

686
00:30:37,503 --> 00:30:39,304
Yeah.

687
00:30:39,372 --> 00:30:42,474
Biggest show on TV, number one.

688
00:30:42,541 --> 00:30:44,342
Oh, and the guy
who does the voice for it ...

689
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:45,744
he's some big
international star, right?

690
00:30:45,811 --> 00:30:47,112
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.

691
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:48,313
All that matters

692
00:30:48,381 --> 00:30:51,249
is everybody wants one
of those dolls, right?

693
00:30:51,317 --> 00:30:53,818
But, sadly...

694
00:30:53,886 --> 00:30:57,889
the Chinese tanker
bringing them over here sank.

695
00:30:57,957 --> 00:31:01,726
They were able to save
about 100,000 dolls.

696
00:31:01,794 --> 00:31:03,862
Unfortunately, none of the crew
was rescued.

697
00:31:03,929 --> 00:31:07,565
So, what,
there's not enough dolls?

698
00:31:07,633 --> 00:31:08,733
Check this out, man.

699
00:31:08,801 --> 00:31:11,770
One of these dolls
sold at auction this morning

700
00:31:11,837 --> 00:31:15,373
for $4,000.

701
00:31:15,441 --> 00:31:16,908
Fuck me.

702
00:31:16,976 --> 00:31:18,543
Yeah.

703
00:31:20,112 --> 00:31:21,413
And...

704
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:26,684
And 2,000 times $4,000
times $4,000 is, uh...

705
00:31:26,752 --> 00:31:27,685
is 8, uh...

706
00:31:27,753 --> 00:31:29,621
that's like ...
no, it's 800 ...

707
00:31:29,688 --> 00:31:31,456
no, it's 8 ...
well, you move ...

708
00:31:31,524 --> 00:31:33,758
well, if it's three zeros h ...

709
00:31:33,826 --> 00:31:35,026
you move the decimal back.

710
00:31:35,094 --> 00:31:37,295
I don't think ... no, well, wait.
-Or...

711
00:31:37,363 --> 00:31:38,596
It's a fucking lot of money!

712
00:31:38,664 --> 00:31:39,764
Oh, it's an ass-load
of money.

713
00:31:39,832 --> 00:31:41,566
Dude, a couple of asses.

714
00:31:41,634 --> 00:31:43,902
Yeah.

715
00:31:43,969 --> 00:31:45,704
Okay.

716
00:31:45,771 --> 00:31:47,706
Okay.

717
00:31:47,773 --> 00:31:49,574
So, what do you want out of me?

718
00:31:51,544 --> 00:31:53,945
Come up with the plan.

719
00:31:54,013 --> 00:31:57,015
'Cause if you remember
the whole flag-stealing thing,

720
00:31:57,083 --> 00:31:58,349
that was my plan.

721
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:00,085
That sucked.

722
00:32:00,152 --> 00:32:02,253
It had
certain structural flaws.

723
00:32:02,321 --> 00:32:04,689
Yeah. Yeah.

724
00:32:04,757 --> 00:32:05,724
Okay.

725
00:32:05,791 --> 00:32:08,626
Okay. Okay.

726
00:32:08,694 --> 00:32:10,862
What we got to do
is we got to ...

727
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:13,131
we got to go to little Germany...
-Yeah.

728
00:32:13,199 --> 00:32:15,066
...And we got to break in there,

729
00:32:15,134 --> 00:32:17,602
and we got to, uh,
get the dolls,

730
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:19,537
and we got to ... we got
to bring them back here.

731
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:21,406
So, we're gonna need
some sort of a, uh...

732
00:32:21,474 --> 00:32:22,407
truck.

733
00:32:22,475 --> 00:32:24,209
Truck.
A truck would be good.

734
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:27,112
Uh, one they can't trace back to us.
-Right.

735
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,784
Aha.

736
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,220
Huh?

737
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:36,421
Yeah.

738
00:32:36,489 --> 00:32:37,655
You got an idea?

739
00:32:37,723 --> 00:32:40,191
I got ...
yeah, I got something.

740
00:32:40,259 --> 00:32:41,393
No, it's gone.

741
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,594
Oh.

742
00:32:42,661 --> 00:32:46,131
George W. Bush is a sham.

743
00:32:46,198 --> 00:32:47,632
He's an actor.

744
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,667
That's not even his real name.

745
00:32:49,735 --> 00:32:53,271
He knows too much.

746
00:32:53,339 --> 00:32:56,307
Mohammed, he's crazy.

747
00:32:56,375 --> 00:32:58,176
He suspects nothing.

748
00:32:58,244 --> 00:32:59,811
I'm sorry.

749
00:32:59,879 --> 00:33:01,446
You are a good man, Habib,

750
00:33:01,514 --> 00:33:05,350
but we are at a critical point
in the plan,

751
00:33:05,418 --> 00:33:06,684
and we must take no chances.

752
00:33:06,752 --> 00:33:07,752
No.

753
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:12,524
Ohh!

754
00:33:29,542 --> 00:33:30,975
Goodbye, heaven tarts...

755
00:33:31,043 --> 00:33:33,812
sugar logs...

756
00:33:33,879 --> 00:33:34,913
powdered flakes...

757
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,781
and sweetie o's.

758
00:33:48,861 --> 00:33:51,563
Goodbye, low-calorie
fudge ice cream.

759
00:33:58,671 --> 00:34:00,305
Allah!

760
00:34:17,757 --> 00:34:18,757
Huh.

761
00:34:22,194 --> 00:34:23,862
How much is this?

762
00:35:39,238 --> 00:35:43,241
Harry!

763
00:35:43,309 --> 00:35:46,911
You got my money, Harry.

764
00:35:52,885 --> 00:35:56,221
What you got
for us today, Harry, huh?

765
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:02,160
No, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

766
00:36:02,228 --> 00:36:04,195
Harry, come on.

767
00:36:04,263 --> 00:36:06,865
You've been out here
for two hours and ...

768
00:36:06,932 --> 00:36:09,434
donating.

769
00:36:09,502 --> 00:36:10,435
H-help the retards.

770
00:36:11,537 --> 00:36:14,739
Doing $13,
motherfucker.

771
00:36:14,807 --> 00:36:17,175
Let's go.

772
00:36:17,243 --> 00:36:18,410
What?

773
00:36:18,477 --> 00:36:20,111
Oh, okay, I thought
you said something.

774
00:36:23,516 --> 00:36:25,417
$5s and $10s only.

775
00:36:26,852 --> 00:36:28,953
No bath this month,
you son of a bitch.

776
00:36:36,495 --> 00:36:39,230
I put some extra nutrients
in your dinner.

777
00:36:39,298 --> 00:36:40,899
You're gonna like it.

778
00:36:40,966 --> 00:36:43,168
Let me see.
Come on.

779
00:36:43,235 --> 00:36:45,136
Mmm!

780
00:36:45,204 --> 00:36:46,838
Good, isn't it?

781
00:36:46,906 --> 00:36:48,039
All righty, baby.

782
00:36:48,107 --> 00:36:50,108
Well, uh, good night.

783
00:36:50,176 --> 00:36:51,543
Big day tomorrow, okay?

784
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:52,677
All right.

785
00:36:54,146 --> 00:36:55,346
What?

786
00:36:55,414 --> 00:36:58,583
Oh, I'm trippin'.

787
00:36:58,651 --> 00:37:00,118
Sorry, buddy.

788
00:37:00,186 --> 00:37:02,487
It does get cold in my garage
late at night.

789
00:37:02,555 --> 00:37:04,756
All right.

790
00:37:04,824 --> 00:37:06,791
Night, Harry.

791
00:37:10,463 --> 00:37:13,364
Welcome to Little Germany
amusement park,

792
00:37:13,432 --> 00:37:16,701
Entertainment center
for Paradise city.

793
00:37:16,769 --> 00:37:19,537
Now, tomorrow the major
media event will happen...

794
00:37:20,673 --> 00:37:23,108
...here at stage,

795
00:37:23,175 --> 00:37:26,644
celebrating the unveiling
of the Krotchy dolls.

796
00:37:26,712 --> 00:37:31,282
The huge international star
of "The Krotchy Show"

797
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:32,584
will be there.

798
00:37:32,651 --> 00:37:35,587
And that is when we'll strike!

799
00:37:35,654 --> 00:37:37,055
Oh!
-Oh! -Oh!

800
00:37:37,123 --> 00:37:39,357
Oh.

801
00:37:39,425 --> 00:37:42,360
Dave and I
will be in the truck,

802
00:37:42,428 --> 00:37:45,063
accessing
the employee entrance.

803
00:37:45,131 --> 00:37:48,633
You are a blessing upon us,
my brother.

804
00:37:48,701 --> 00:37:51,503
It is as it was foretold
in the good book.

805
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:55,040
"And then there will come
one amongst them,

806
00:37:55,107 --> 00:37:57,909
"an apos-tle
who carries within him

807
00:37:57,977 --> 00:37:59,911
the holy torch
of righteousness."

808
00:37:59,979 --> 00:38:01,112
Uh-huh.

809
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:03,915
"He will lead us out
of the clutches of consumerism."

810
00:38:03,983 --> 00:38:05,450
Mm-hmm.
-Mm-hmm.

811
00:38:05,518 --> 00:38:08,420
You wrote a fucking bible
for these people?

812
00:38:08,487 --> 00:38:10,922
Group "C" rappels down

813
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:13,758
and takes the dolls
from the storeroom.

814
00:38:13,826 --> 00:38:17,395
Group "E"
must control the perimeter,

815
00:38:17,463 --> 00:38:19,764
as our intelligence indicates

816
00:38:19,832 --> 00:38:24,569
that another organization
may be after the dolls, as well.

817
00:38:29,809 --> 00:38:32,010
I'll get that.

818
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:37,582
Bin Laden.
Hello? It's your dime.

819
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:40,118
Osama, you old fucker.

820
00:38:40,186 --> 00:38:41,653
It's G.W.

821
00:38:41,721 --> 00:38:43,722
You know how many innocent
people we've had to torture

822
00:38:43,789 --> 00:38:45,090
Trying to get a lead on you?

823
00:38:45,157 --> 00:38:46,524
So?
It's not my fault.

824
00:38:46,592 --> 00:38:47,859
What is it, Georgie?

825
00:38:47,927 --> 00:38:49,661
I, uh ... kind of busy here.

826
00:38:49,729 --> 00:38:54,132
You know how pops has those
oil pipelines in Saudi Arabia?

827
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:57,035
I'm wondering if we ought
to file an insurance claim,

828
00:38:57,103 --> 00:38:59,738
You know,
after the whole thing blows up.

829
00:39:00,873 --> 00:39:02,674
All right, well,
drop me an e-mail,

830
00:39:02,742 --> 00:39:04,209
tell me what pipe
you're talking about,

831
00:39:04,276 --> 00:39:05,710
and I'll blow it
all the way to Mecca.

832
00:39:05,778 --> 00:39:07,412
We'd really appreciate it.

833
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,381
I'll ask Laura
to type that up ...

834
00:39:09,448 --> 00:39:12,183
you know,
me and spelling and all.

835
00:39:13,619 --> 00:39:16,321
All right, later.

836
00:39:18,391 --> 00:39:19,457
Jihad!

837
00:39:31,237 --> 00:39:33,705
First they promise me
a private jet.

838
00:39:33,773 --> 00:39:35,974
Then they send me
a freakin' bus?

839
00:39:36,042 --> 00:39:37,242
Geez!

840
00:39:37,309 --> 00:39:40,078
Don't they know
I'm an international superstar?

841
00:39:40,146 --> 00:39:41,846
Ugh!

842
00:39:41,914 --> 00:39:43,548
Jesus!

843
00:39:46,752 --> 00:39:48,787
Aw, Jesus.

844
00:39:54,627 --> 00:39:57,629
Paradise 8 miles?

845
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:59,364
God!

846
00:40:00,833 --> 00:40:03,234
Motherfuckers.

847
00:40:17,783 --> 00:40:19,517
I'm telling you, Mohammed.

848
00:40:19,585 --> 00:40:22,253
I know I've seen that gas
station before. We're lost.

849
00:40:22,321 --> 00:40:24,255
We are not lost.
All gas stations look alike.

850
00:40:24,323 --> 00:40:25,390
What's wrong with you?

851
00:40:25,458 --> 00:40:27,859
Will you just pull over
and ask for directions?

852
00:40:27,927 --> 00:40:29,260
Get off my back!

853
00:40:29,328 --> 00:40:31,429
You know,
I'm doing my best here, okay?

854
00:40:31,497 --> 00:40:32,897
I should be driving.

855
00:40:32,965 --> 00:40:34,632
What, do you think
you're gonna do everything,

856
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,701
be the face of the organization
and also do the driving?

857
00:40:36,769 --> 00:40:38,236
What is wrong with you, man?

858
00:40:49,882 --> 00:40:52,250
Mommy, Krotchy!

859
00:40:53,319 --> 00:40:54,919
Aww!

860
00:40:59,225 --> 00:41:01,726
Hey!

861
00:41:01,794 --> 00:41:04,896
I'm here at the theme park
Little Germany

862
00:41:04,964 --> 00:41:07,999
with owner and controversial
director Uwe Boll.

863
00:41:09,335 --> 00:41:11,603
Uwe, you made your fortune

864
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:13,972
turning video games
into hit movies,

865
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,107
but this theme park
has always been your passion,

866
00:41:16,175 --> 00:41:18,977
and today is a big day
for Little Germany.

867
00:41:19,045 --> 00:41:20,678
Absolutely.
I'm totally happy

868
00:41:20,746 --> 00:41:22,881
that that freighter
went down from China

869
00:41:22,948 --> 00:41:24,182
with all the Krotchy dolls,

870
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:27,185
So we, as the only people
in North America

871
00:41:27,253 --> 00:41:30,688
having the Krotchy dolls
exclusively here on sale.

872
00:41:37,897 --> 00:41:39,164
Yay!

873
00:41:39,231 --> 00:41:43,468
All right,
what is all this shit, man?

874
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:47,639
Ooh, Harry,
it's time to go to work.

875
00:41:47,707 --> 00:41:50,108
Get your hat on.
Let me see.

876
00:41:50,176 --> 00:41:52,343
Yeah!

877
00:41:52,411 --> 00:41:53,445
Watch this. Watch this.

878
00:41:53,512 --> 00:41:55,280
Say "will work for food"
in German.

879
00:41:56,816 --> 00:41:58,149
You the shit.

880
00:41:58,217 --> 00:41:59,718
All right, go on, now.

881
00:41:59,785 --> 00:42:02,287
All right, no $1s.

882
00:42:02,354 --> 00:42:04,522
That's my motherfucker
right there.

883
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:07,625
Watch out for the flowers,
Harry.

884
00:42:07,693 --> 00:42:10,328
But I want to use the situation
here, where I'm live in TV,

885
00:42:10,396 --> 00:42:13,364
and I want to explain a little
about the financing of my movies

886
00:42:13,432 --> 00:42:16,234
and also from Little Germany,
where the money comes from

887
00:42:16,302 --> 00:42:18,169
because, you know,
there are all the rumors out

888
00:42:18,237 --> 00:42:20,505
that my movies
are financed with Nazi gold.

889
00:42:20,573 --> 00:42:22,907
And what should I say?
It's true.

890
00:42:22,975 --> 00:42:25,043
But somebody must do something
with the money.

891
00:42:25,111 --> 00:42:26,244
Ja!

892
00:42:26,312 --> 00:42:29,447
I get a little horny here
onstage sometimes,

893
00:42:29,515 --> 00:42:31,716
if I see a crowd
and all the children.

894
00:42:31,784 --> 00:42:33,718
Are you fucking kidding me?

895
00:42:44,497 --> 00:42:46,331
Master, allow me.

896
00:42:57,743 --> 00:42:59,677
What about me?

897
00:42:59,745 --> 00:43:02,080
Do your job.

898
00:43:02,148 --> 00:43:03,248
Stupid.

899
00:43:03,315 --> 00:43:06,785
Oh, what,
are you gonna fire me?

900
00:43:06,852 --> 00:43:08,386
For saying "fuck"?

901
00:43:08,454 --> 00:43:10,522
Well, fucky-fuck-fuck you, Dan.

902
00:43:10,589 --> 00:43:13,425
I'm the fucking show.
You mind if I go to work now?

903
00:43:13,492 --> 00:43:16,061
Thank you.

904
00:43:16,128 --> 00:43:19,531
Five, four ...
I got shit in my teeth?

905
00:43:19,598 --> 00:43:21,533
Thank you.

906
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,768
Hi, we're live in Little Germany
in Paradise.

907
00:43:23,836 --> 00:43:25,370
It's an amazing sight.

908
00:43:25,438 --> 00:43:27,205
The crowd
is trembling with excitement.

909
00:43:27,273 --> 00:43:29,641
People have been lining up
for days to be the first

910
00:43:29,709 --> 00:43:32,877
to get their hands
on the coveted Krotchy dolls.

911
00:43:40,119 --> 00:43:41,586
Ladies...

912
00:43:41,654 --> 00:43:43,888
Today we do God's work,

913
00:43:43,956 --> 00:43:46,291
so get in there
and give those boys a God job.

914
00:43:46,358 --> 00:43:48,960
Yes, sir.

915
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:52,597
Hi, boys.

916
00:43:54,734 --> 00:43:58,336
Uh-oh.
Looks like I'm gonna get a burn.

917
00:43:59,405 --> 00:44:00,638
Oops.

918
00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:07,779
Oh, God.

919
00:44:07,847 --> 00:44:08,947
They're so creepy.

920
00:44:09,014 --> 00:44:10,315
Yeah, so?

921
00:44:10,383 --> 00:44:12,317
Come on, boys!

922
00:44:12,385 --> 00:44:14,753
Can you guys
give me a hand?

923
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:17,789
Okay.
Let's go.

924
00:44:17,857 --> 00:44:19,257
Come on, boys.

925
00:44:19,325 --> 00:44:20,658
Whoo!

926
00:44:20,726 --> 00:44:22,627
Come here.

927
00:44:26,532 --> 00:44:27,665
Huh.

928
00:44:28,934 --> 00:44:30,969
Ha ha!

929
00:44:31,037 --> 00:44:33,338
Whoa-ho!

930
00:44:33,406 --> 00:44:34,506
Oh, yes!

931
00:44:34,573 --> 00:44:37,108
Oh, you sexy little
motherfucker.

932
00:44:37,176 --> 00:44:39,077
Unh! Unh!

933
00:44:39,145 --> 00:44:41,713
Gayle, is that Verne's limo?

934
00:44:41,781 --> 00:44:44,449
Uh, I can't see, Bob.

935
00:44:44,517 --> 00:44:48,286
There seems to be a pickup truck
in the way.

936
00:44:48,354 --> 00:44:51,189
A pickup truck?

937
00:44:51,257 --> 00:44:52,457
Well, that's classy.

938
00:44:55,928 --> 00:44:57,228
Yo, man.

939
00:45:03,703 --> 00:45:07,672
I just can't possibly explain
how ... how unbelievably sorry

940
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:08,807
we are, Mr. Troyer.

941
00:45:08,874 --> 00:45:10,842
I personally will take
full responsibility

942
00:45:10,910 --> 00:45:12,310
for this confusion
with the pickup.

943
00:45:12,378 --> 00:45:13,645
I don't want you fired.

944
00:45:13,713 --> 00:45:15,346
I want
your fucking boss fired.

945
00:45:15,414 --> 00:45:17,182
So, what did you do
with the guards?

946
00:45:17,249 --> 00:45:18,516
They're all worn out.

947
00:45:18,584 --> 00:45:20,185
Mm.

948
00:45:20,252 --> 00:45:21,619
All right.
Okay, ladies.

949
00:45:21,687 --> 00:45:24,456
Get to work
on lifting the crates.

950
00:45:24,523 --> 00:45:25,790
This is great.

951
00:45:25,858 --> 00:45:27,392
That means that...

952
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:30,479
The whole park is busy
with the pissed-off V.I.P.

953
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:30,962
Mm-hmm.

954
00:45:31,030 --> 00:45:33,231
That means
my plan is genius!

955
00:45:33,299 --> 00:45:34,366
Yeah.

956
00:45:35,668 --> 00:45:37,569
Come on, cowboy up.
Cowboy up!

957
00:45:57,523 --> 00:45:59,858
It's locked.

958
00:46:03,295 --> 00:46:06,030
There must be
another way in!

959
00:46:15,207 --> 00:46:17,542
Where's my money, asswipe?

960
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:19,277
I have even better ...

961
00:46:19,345 --> 00:46:21,713
gold teeth.

962
00:46:23,916 --> 00:46:25,650
Hello, Paradise.

963
00:46:28,387 --> 00:46:30,021
Help me, Krotchy.

964
00:46:30,089 --> 00:46:31,356
I'm a beautiful lady.
Help me.

965
00:46:31,424 --> 00:46:33,224
Well, you know
what the good and noble Krotchy

966
00:46:33,292 --> 00:46:34,659
says about people in need.

967
00:46:34,727 --> 00:46:37,395
Only my father and
my priest can touch me there.

968
00:46:39,632 --> 00:46:40,832
Uncle Dave, look out!

969
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:42,967
What the fuck?

970
00:46:43,035 --> 00:46:44,736
Get to the truck.
We'll meet you out front.

971
00:46:44,804 --> 00:46:46,037
Come on!

972
00:46:46,105 --> 00:46:48,406
Anne Frank, you better have
some chaos out there.

973
00:46:48,474 --> 00:46:49,507
We're coming your way!

974
00:46:51,544 --> 00:46:53,578
This is Anne Frank.
Abort mission!

975
00:46:53,646 --> 00:46:56,347
You come down here,
you'll be arrested in a second!

976
00:46:56,415 --> 00:46:59,017
You are the envy
of the entire country.

977
00:46:59,085 --> 00:47:01,720
Anne Frank,
we need a distraction.

978
00:47:01,787 --> 00:47:04,155
We need a distraction now!

979
00:47:06,659 --> 00:47:08,359
You are the first city

980
00:47:08,427 --> 00:47:11,896
to receive
the officially licensed...

981
00:47:11,964 --> 00:47:13,364
Krotchy doll.

982
00:47:16,569 --> 00:47:19,771
Oh, powerful lord,
hear my plea.

983
00:47:21,073 --> 00:47:22,540
Boll, I'm Vince Desi.

984
00:47:22,608 --> 00:47:24,376
What the fuck did you do
to my game "Postal"?

985
00:47:24,443 --> 00:47:25,977
I don't know
what your fucking problem is.

986
00:47:26,045 --> 00:47:27,379
The movie is great.

987
00:47:30,916 --> 00:47:32,050
Oh, shit!

988
00:47:32,118 --> 00:47:33,218
Oh!

989
00:47:38,391 --> 00:47:39,858
Officers, you realize

990
00:47:39,925 --> 00:47:42,527
there's a huge fight going on
onstage right now?

991
00:47:42,595 --> 00:47:44,062
Yeah.
-Yeah.

992
00:47:45,064 --> 00:47:46,965
Unh!

993
00:47:47,032 --> 00:47:49,968
Anne Frank,
we're coming your way now!

994
00:47:51,303 --> 00:47:52,871
Party's over.

995
00:47:52,938 --> 00:47:55,240
Freaking Nazi
motherfucker!

996
00:47:55,307 --> 00:47:56,641
Get your hands
off me!

997
00:47:56,709 --> 00:47:57,809
For video games!

998
00:47:59,445 --> 00:48:01,413
No!
He shot Harry!

999
00:48:05,084 --> 00:48:06,317
Son of a bitch!

1000
00:48:06,385 --> 00:48:08,486
Aah!

1001
00:48:12,625 --> 00:48:14,325
Be careful.

1002
00:48:19,065 --> 00:48:21,533
Harry! I'm gonna come
and help you, baby!

1003
00:48:26,372 --> 00:48:27,939
Aah!

1004
00:48:31,544 --> 00:48:32,877
Whoa!

1005
00:48:43,622 --> 00:48:45,223
Ooh!

1006
00:48:47,193 --> 00:48:49,861
I hate video games.

1007
00:48:51,530 --> 00:48:53,264
Aah!

1008
00:48:53,332 --> 00:48:55,033
Aah!

1009
00:48:55,101 --> 00:48:57,135
Let's get the hell
out of here!

1010
00:49:08,914 --> 00:49:10,281
Aah!

1011
00:49:24,096 --> 00:49:25,630
Get out of the way!

1012
00:49:27,666 --> 00:49:29,000
Ohh!

1013
00:49:29,068 --> 00:49:30,468
Oh! My shit!

1014
00:49:30,536 --> 00:49:31,803
I'm so sorry!

1015
00:49:31,871 --> 00:49:33,738
What are you doing with my shit?
-I'm a huge fan.

1016
00:49:33,806 --> 00:49:35,807
Let me give you a hand with that.
-Leave it alone.

1017
00:49:35,875 --> 00:49:37,842
I had no idea you be c ...

1018
00:49:37,910 --> 00:49:40,178
A dildo on a stick? That's crazy!
-That's mine.

1019
00:49:41,914 --> 00:49:43,586
Let me see if I can help
you get everything in!

1020
00:49:43,587 --> 00:49:44,282
What are you doing?

1021
00:49:45,651 --> 00:49:47,952
Jesus!

1022
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:49,521
What the fuck?!

1023
00:49:49,588 --> 00:49:51,890
God damn!

1024
00:49:51,957 --> 00:49:53,391
What ...

1025
00:49:53,459 --> 00:49:56,494
God ...
I'm in my fucking suitcase.

1026
00:49:59,999 --> 00:50:00,965
Richard, what the fuck?

1027
00:50:01,033 --> 00:50:02,133
It's a present.

1028
00:50:03,035 --> 00:50:05,136
Hey! Assholes!

1029
00:50:10,042 --> 00:50:12,711
Uh...

1030
00:50:12,778 --> 00:50:14,479
Coffee shop.

1031
00:50:14,547 --> 00:50:15,980
Lattes, no foam.

1032
00:50:16,048 --> 00:50:18,917
Yeah.

1033
00:50:18,984 --> 00:50:20,652
Uh, I got to go.

1034
00:50:29,061 --> 00:50:30,462
Why did you bring him?

1035
00:50:30,529 --> 00:50:32,197
Mind your own business
and get us out of here!

1036
00:50:32,264 --> 00:50:34,299
Shut up, you big crybaby.

1037
00:50:35,301 --> 00:50:37,135
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

1038
00:50:37,203 --> 00:50:38,303
Hey!

1039
00:50:38,371 --> 00:50:40,805
Move, move, move, move, move.
Go, go, go.

1040
00:50:44,844 --> 00:50:46,244
Let's go, baby.

1041
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:50,648
Where is...the damn key?

1042
00:50:50,716 --> 00:50:52,584
You don't have the keys?

1043
00:50:52,651 --> 00:50:54,452
I thought you had the keys.

1044
00:51:02,428 --> 00:51:03,895
It's like
when you were a kid.

1045
00:51:03,963 --> 00:51:05,997
Sometimes it helps to retrace your steps.
-Oh.

1046
00:51:06,065 --> 00:51:07,132
Mohammed.

1047
00:51:07,199 --> 00:51:10,101
You're under arrest!

1048
00:51:10,169 --> 00:51:12,170
You killed Harry!

1049
00:51:12,238 --> 00:51:14,672
Start shooting, John.
Do something. Shit!

1050
00:51:16,108 --> 00:51:18,176
Harry wasn't hurting nobody.

1051
00:51:19,512 --> 00:51:20,645
What the fuck am I gonna do

1052
00:51:20,713 --> 00:51:22,380
with all those damn diapers
I bought him?

1053
00:51:23,582 --> 00:51:24,849
Good God!

1054
00:51:24,917 --> 00:51:27,786
You're stepping
on my thing! Oh!

1055
00:51:27,853 --> 00:51:29,187
Allah be praised.

1056
00:51:29,255 --> 00:51:33,224
Now you will give your lives
to avenge this outrage.

1057
00:51:33,292 --> 00:51:36,227
Or we could just kill
the other guys.

1058
00:51:36,295 --> 00:51:37,228
Yeah!

1059
00:51:53,546 --> 00:51:55,680
Jesus Christ,
can you control this thing?

1060
00:51:55,748 --> 00:51:57,048
Yes!

1061
00:51:58,484 --> 00:52:01,386
Watch where you're going!

1062
00:52:01,454 --> 00:52:02,420
Oh, god.

1063
00:52:08,461 --> 00:52:11,596
It's the moo cow
from the welfare office.

1064
00:52:11,664 --> 00:52:13,231
"sorry, we're closed."

1065
00:52:13,299 --> 00:52:14,699
Bitch!

1066
00:52:17,803 --> 00:52:18,737
What was that?

1067
00:52:22,408 --> 00:52:24,909
Oh.

1068
00:52:24,977 --> 00:52:28,480
I thought we had a flat,
but we just ran over some girl.

1069
00:52:28,547 --> 00:52:31,282
Whew! Thank god.

1070
00:52:31,350 --> 00:52:33,084
Got a body on maple.

1071
00:52:33,152 --> 00:52:36,321
Tag 22,
please repeat your location.

1072
00:52:36,389 --> 00:52:38,757
Maple, like the syrup.

1073
00:52:38,824 --> 00:52:41,493
Oh, this is
fucking fantastic.

1074
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:44,529
Oh, my God,
these kids are heavy!

1075
00:52:44,597 --> 00:52:47,165
Okay.
All right.

1076
00:52:47,233 --> 00:52:49,267
Gary ... wait.

1077
00:52:49,335 --> 00:52:50,535
Just wait.
Wait.

1078
00:52:50,603 --> 00:52:52,604
Oh, yeah.

1079
00:52:52,671 --> 00:52:53,605
Okay.

1080
00:52:53,672 --> 00:52:55,373
Roll it, Gary.

1081
00:52:55,441 --> 00:52:57,175
Make me a star.

1082
00:52:57,243 --> 00:52:58,843
Oh, my god.

1083
00:52:58,911 --> 00:53:01,012
This is Gayle Ravenson

1084
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:03,782
reporting live
from Little Germany theme park,

1085
00:53:03,849 --> 00:53:05,150
on what will forevermore

1086
00:53:05,217 --> 00:53:08,453
be known as the place
where the laughter died.

1087
00:53:08,521 --> 00:53:10,889
Celebrity icon Verne Troyer

1088
00:53:10,956 --> 00:53:13,892
is currently missing
or presumed dead.

1089
00:53:13,959 --> 00:53:16,494
The coward responsible
for this massacre

1090
00:53:16,562 --> 00:53:19,998
has been described as
a rodent-like man with red hair

1091
00:53:20,066 --> 00:53:22,033
and wearing
a "peace" T-shirt.

1092
00:53:22,101 --> 00:53:24,569
Back to you, Bob.

1093
00:53:24,637 --> 00:53:26,004
Oh, that's right.

1094
00:53:26,072 --> 00:53:27,972
You're dead.

1095
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:30,408
These kids
are starting to smell.

1096
00:53:32,278 --> 00:53:35,747
I can't believe
I took this fucking job.

1097
00:53:35,815 --> 00:53:37,415
Fucking bullshit.

1098
00:53:37,483 --> 00:53:40,018
God damn it.

1099
00:53:40,086 --> 00:53:41,853
This helps.

1100
00:53:41,921 --> 00:53:43,722
Definitely helps.

1101
00:53:52,364 --> 00:53:54,399
We need to get him
inside immediately,

1102
00:53:54,467 --> 00:53:56,201
along with the merchandise!
-Yes.

1103
00:53:56,268 --> 00:53:58,503
Jesus titty-fuck,
they're already here.

1104
00:53:58,571 --> 00:53:59,671
Now what do we do?

1105
00:53:59,739 --> 00:54:01,506
That was the safest place
in all of Paradise.

1106
00:54:01,574 --> 00:54:02,907
You guys don't have
like a bomb shelter

1107
00:54:02,975 --> 00:54:04,509
or a basement or something,
you know,

1108
00:54:04,577 --> 00:54:06,857
that the Taliban couldn't
have found themselves, right?

1109
00:54:06,858 --> 00:54:07,345
No, we don't.

1110
00:54:07,413 --> 00:54:08,413
We do.
-What?

1111
00:54:08,481 --> 00:54:09,614
We do.

1112
00:54:09,682 --> 00:54:11,583
There's
a massive underground shelter

1113
00:54:11,650 --> 00:54:13,518
beneath the main compound.

1114
00:54:13,586 --> 00:54:14,819
It's perfect.

1115
00:54:14,887 --> 00:54:16,588
You know
what would be perfect?

1116
00:54:16,655 --> 00:54:18,089
My foot up your ass.

1117
00:54:19,658 --> 00:54:21,626
Who the fuck
are you people?

1118
00:54:21,694 --> 00:54:23,428
What the fuck
did you bring him for?

1119
00:54:23,496 --> 00:54:25,230
You'll see, Uncle Dave.

1120
00:54:25,297 --> 00:54:26,998
Do you think we can sneak him
past the Taliban

1121
00:54:27,066 --> 00:54:28,299
without them finding out?

1122
00:54:28,367 --> 00:54:30,802
And where the fuck are
you gonna hide my Krotchy dolls?

1123
00:54:30,870 --> 00:54:32,070
In plain sight.

1124
00:54:32,138 --> 00:54:33,705
Somebody grab
the little guy.

1125
00:54:33,773 --> 00:54:35,206
Come on, little guy.

1126
00:54:35,274 --> 00:54:37,208
What the fuck's going on?

1127
00:54:37,276 --> 00:54:38,209
Come on.

1128
00:54:38,277 --> 00:54:39,477
Okay.
Shut up.

1129
00:54:39,545 --> 00:54:40,812
Come on.

1130
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:44,416
Citizens of this great nation ...

1131
00:54:44,483 --> 00:54:45,817
town...

1132
00:54:45,885 --> 00:54:51,723
be on the lookout for this
psychopathic, deranged killer,

1133
00:54:51,791 --> 00:54:53,124
also known as...

1134
00:54:53,192 --> 00:54:54,592
Postal Dude.

1135
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:56,127
...Postal Dude.

1136
00:54:56,195 --> 00:54:58,563
That's the best
we could come up ... Postal Dude.

1137
00:54:58,631 --> 00:55:00,799
He's wanted in conjunction
with the kidnapping,

1138
00:55:00,866 --> 00:55:02,734
the shooting
at the welfare office...

1139
00:55:02,802 --> 00:55:04,803
the assassination
of candidate Wells...

1140
00:55:04,870 --> 00:55:06,271
and killing a Chinese woman.

1141
00:55:06,338 --> 00:55:09,607
He killed
a poor, innocent Chinese lady.

1142
00:55:09,675 --> 00:55:10,909
So, if you see him...

1143
00:55:10,976 --> 00:55:12,644
You ever just have
one of those days?

1144
00:55:12,712 --> 00:55:14,479
Mm, no.

1145
00:55:14,547 --> 00:55:15,647
Hey! Hey!

1146
00:55:15,715 --> 00:55:17,248
The Postal Dude!

1147
00:55:17,316 --> 00:55:18,249
Get him!

1148
00:55:18,317 --> 00:55:19,250
Hey, come on!

1149
00:55:20,386 --> 00:55:23,254
Uh, I don't think that's him.

1150
00:55:23,322 --> 00:55:26,157
See how his hair flows,
though?

1151
00:55:26,225 --> 00:55:28,493
This guy
looks more like Jesus.

1152
00:55:32,665 --> 00:55:34,232
Shit. Shit.

1153
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:35,767
Shit, shit, shit.

1154
00:55:35,835 --> 00:55:37,936
Let's go!

1155
00:55:38,003 --> 00:55:39,404
Thank you!

1156
00:55:41,173 --> 00:55:42,674
Get him!
Come on!

1157
00:55:42,742 --> 00:55:44,676
Hey, which way did he go?

1158
00:55:44,744 --> 00:55:45,910
This way!

1159
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:49,481
Why did you help him?

1160
00:55:49,548 --> 00:55:51,049
Want to clean
the windows again?

1161
00:55:51,117 --> 00:55:53,017
Yeah, fuck.

1162
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:09,501
Hold it!

1163
00:56:09,568 --> 00:56:11,569
Up against the wall now!

1164
00:56:11,637 --> 00:56:12,871
Ow!

1165
00:56:12,938 --> 00:56:14,072
Huh?

1166
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:17,375
Look like I bagged me
the Postal Dude.

1167
00:56:17,443 --> 00:56:19,511
Ugh!

1168
00:56:19,578 --> 00:56:21,613
God damn!

1169
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:23,748
You son of a bitch!

1170
00:56:23,816 --> 00:56:25,984
I think
you busted my nose!

1171
00:56:26,052 --> 00:56:28,219
Ohh, fuck!

1172
00:56:28,287 --> 00:56:30,755
You fucking asshole!

1173
00:56:30,823 --> 00:56:32,190
I'm gonna fuck you up!

1174
00:56:32,258 --> 00:56:33,525
Ugh!

1175
00:56:33,592 --> 00:56:35,693
Sorry.

1176
00:56:40,833 --> 00:56:42,434
I think he went
that way!

1177
00:56:49,442 --> 00:56:52,711
No wonder cops are crabby.
This weighs a fucking ton.

1178
00:56:52,778 --> 00:56:55,313
Handcuffs ... those are cool.

1179
00:56:55,381 --> 00:56:57,549
What is that?
Is that like a flashlight?

1180
00:56:57,616 --> 00:56:59,184
Pepper spray.

1181
00:56:59,251 --> 00:57:00,518
Pepper spray is neat.

1182
00:57:00,586 --> 00:57:02,620
Officer!

1183
00:57:02,688 --> 00:57:06,224
Paul Lipscombe, neighborhood
watchdog group, Chapter 232.

1184
00:57:06,292 --> 00:57:08,326
Good job, citizen.

1185
00:57:08,394 --> 00:57:09,861
Did you see the Postal Dude?

1186
00:57:09,929 --> 00:57:11,763
Yes, uh, yes.

1187
00:57:11,831 --> 00:57:13,231
He went down
thataway.

1188
00:57:13,299 --> 00:57:14,332
Right.

1189
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:16,901
Citizens united,
let's get this fucker!

1190
00:57:16,969 --> 00:57:18,503
Get him!

1191
00:57:24,076 --> 00:57:25,744
Hey, hey.

1192
00:57:25,811 --> 00:57:26,945
Nice outfit.

1193
00:57:27,012 --> 00:57:30,081
Like you couldn't be
more of an ass already.

1194
00:57:30,149 --> 00:57:31,416
You look like a penguin.

1195
00:57:31,484 --> 00:57:33,551
So, I dropped the junk off.

1196
00:57:33,619 --> 00:57:34,652
Yeah.

1197
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:38,456
Now, where is
that underground shelter place?

1198
00:57:38,524 --> 00:57:40,658
Shh.
Go through the bedroom.

1199
00:57:40,726 --> 00:57:41,860
Yeah, the ... okay.

1200
00:57:41,927 --> 00:57:42,861
Zzzhhh!

1201
00:57:42,928 --> 00:57:44,229
All right, all right,
I'm going in.

1202
00:57:44,296 --> 00:57:45,463
All right.

1203
00:57:45,531 --> 00:57:47,499
All right, I'm going in.
Stay.

1204
00:57:52,138 --> 00:57:53,538
Have you heard
from Osama?

1205
00:57:53,606 --> 00:57:54,739
No.

1206
00:57:54,807 --> 00:57:56,074
Heard from the truck?

1207
00:57:56,142 --> 00:57:57,175
No.

1208
00:57:57,243 --> 00:57:59,177
Have you seen the dog?
-No!

1209
00:57:59,245 --> 00:58:00,378
Do you know anything?
-I don't know.

1210
00:58:00,446 --> 00:58:01,513
You are stupid!

1211
00:58:01,580 --> 00:58:02,747
Mohammed, I'm sorry.

1212
00:58:02,815 --> 00:58:03,782
Stupid...

1213
00:58:18,864 --> 00:58:21,399
<i>...Why the World Trade
Center victims deserved to die,</i>

1214
00:58:21,467 --> 00:58:22,667
<i>after the break.</i>

1215
00:58:22,735 --> 00:58:24,836

1220
00:58:45,558 --> 00:58:47,659
Psst!
Puss, puss, puss.

1221
00:58:47,727 --> 00:58:49,494
Here, you stupid cat.

1222
00:59:04,477 --> 00:59:05,510
Meow!

1223
00:59:05,578 --> 00:59:06,845
Hmm?

1224
00:59:06,912 --> 00:59:08,546
Aah!

1225
00:59:10,416 --> 00:59:12,183
Good kitty.

1226
00:59:15,688 --> 00:59:17,956
Psst, psst.
Come on. Come on.

1227
00:59:18,023 --> 00:59:19,591
Gah.

1228
00:59:21,761 --> 00:59:23,561
Stay low.

1229
00:59:23,629 --> 00:59:25,263
I already am.

1230
00:59:25,331 --> 00:59:26,398
Go.
Go, go, go.

1231
00:59:33,906 --> 00:59:37,175
Let's go. Come on.
Up, up, up, up, up, up.

1232
00:59:37,243 --> 00:59:39,577
Get him.
Get him. Get him.

1233
00:59:39,645 --> 00:59:42,680
Shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

1234
00:59:42,748 --> 00:59:44,149
Line up, my sexies.

1235
00:59:44,216 --> 00:59:47,485
That includes you, too,
Mr. Troyer.

1236
00:59:48,988 --> 00:59:52,090
Jenny, would you mind
opening it?

1237
00:59:52,158 --> 00:59:55,193
My pleasure.

1238
00:59:55,261 --> 00:59:57,195
Jenny, you, too, huh?

1239
00:59:57,263 --> 00:59:59,130
Am I the only fucking person

1240
00:59:59,198 --> 01:00:02,534
who didn't know there was a bomb
shelter underneath my bedroom?

1241
01:00:02,601 --> 01:00:06,204
It's not a bomb shelter,
Uncle Dave.

1242
01:00:08,841 --> 01:00:11,342
I can't believe
this fucking shit.

1243
01:00:11,410 --> 01:00:13,611
It's a god shelter.

1244
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:19,784
Richie,
what the fuck is this?

1245
01:00:19,852 --> 01:00:21,019
This is amazing.

1246
01:00:21,087 --> 01:00:22,487
This is a shithole.

1247
01:00:23,856 --> 01:00:25,657
What is
all this for?

1248
01:00:25,725 --> 01:00:28,860
Dave's bible,
Chapter 11, Psalm 23 ...

1249
01:00:28,928 --> 01:00:31,196
"and in the end,
the fire and the plagues

1250
01:00:31,263 --> 01:00:33,198
"will come
at the behest of the Lord,

1251
01:00:33,265 --> 01:00:35,500
"and the sores and the boils,

1252
01:00:35,568 --> 01:00:38,436
"and the intestinal ulcers
and testicular tumors

1253
01:00:38,504 --> 01:00:42,140
shall befall
all of humanity"...

1254
01:00:42,208 --> 01:00:47,112
except for those who hide
like rabbits below the ground.

1255
01:00:47,179 --> 01:00:49,414
Hey, this is pretty sweet.

1256
01:00:49,482 --> 01:00:50,582
You ever, uh, fire ...

1257
01:00:50,649 --> 01:00:52,584
Don't touch anything!

1258
01:00:52,651 --> 01:00:53,952
Aah!

1259
01:00:54,019 --> 01:00:58,623
We will need every bullet
for the end of all things.

1260
01:00:58,691 --> 01:01:00,358
That's great, Richie.

1261
01:01:00,426 --> 01:01:03,661
But right now we've got
a problem, all right?

1262
01:01:03,729 --> 01:01:06,564
My house is full of a bunch
of fucking religious fanatics

1263
01:01:06,632 --> 01:01:09,000
who think they're gonna be the
chosen people at the end of the world.

1264
01:01:09,068 --> 01:01:10,735
As opposed to ...
shut the fuck up.

1265
01:01:10,803 --> 01:01:12,137
Why don't you
shut the fuck up?

1266
01:01:12,204 --> 01:01:14,039
You don't think I'll come over there?
I'll come over there.

1267
01:01:14,106 --> 01:01:16,107
I'll stick this finger
up your ass.

1268
01:01:16,175 --> 01:01:17,642
Yeah, you
and what fucking ladder?

1269
01:01:17,710 --> 01:01:19,144
I'll get you.
-I'll fucking ...

1270
01:01:19,211 --> 01:01:20,145
Take this.

1271
01:01:20,212 --> 01:01:21,279
God damn.

1272
01:01:21,347 --> 01:01:22,981
Richie, the point is...

1273
01:01:23,049 --> 01:01:26,051
We don't need to be worried
about the end right now, okay?

1274
01:01:26,118 --> 01:01:27,852
We just need
to take those guns,

1275
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:29,687
go upstairs,
kill some motherfuckers,

1276
01:01:29,755 --> 01:01:31,589
get my merchandise back,

1277
01:01:31,657 --> 01:01:34,659
sell it so we can pay off
the IRS, all right?

1278
01:01:34,727 --> 01:01:38,029
Not gonna sell the merchandise,
Uncle Dave.

1279
01:01:38,097 --> 01:01:39,364
What?!

1280
01:01:39,432 --> 01:01:41,866
I am sorry to inform you,

1281
01:01:41,934 --> 01:01:44,669
but that was never part
of the plan.

1282
01:01:50,876 --> 01:01:53,678
So, what is the plan?

1283
01:01:53,746 --> 01:01:56,981
To end the world,
of course.

1284
01:01:57,049 --> 01:01:59,884
You guys have issues, man.

1285
01:01:59,952 --> 01:02:01,519
Did you know about this?

1286
01:02:01,587 --> 01:02:03,688
No, I didn't fucking know about this.
-But he works for you.

1287
01:02:03,756 --> 01:02:04,689
Apparently not.

1288
01:02:04,757 --> 01:02:06,524
Dah!
I can hear you.

1289
01:02:07,593 --> 01:02:09,094
Richie...

1290
01:02:09,161 --> 01:02:10,995
Richie...

1291
01:02:13,399 --> 01:02:15,433
Now it is time
for the rest of you

1292
01:02:15,501 --> 01:02:18,236
to know the full extent
of our plan.

1293
01:02:18,304 --> 01:02:22,841
This is why we need
the Krotchy dolls.

1294
01:02:22,908 --> 01:02:26,244
What happens up my ass
stays up my ass.

1295
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:31,015
The Avian Bird Flu ...

1296
01:02:31,083 --> 01:02:36,321
the plague for which
the western devil has no cure.

1297
01:02:36,389 --> 01:02:37,922
If these dolls

1298
01:02:37,990 --> 01:02:41,092
are to be distributed
throughout the United States,

1299
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:43,595
there will be
death and destruction

1300
01:02:43,662 --> 01:02:45,497
beyond all comprehension!

1301
01:02:45,564 --> 01:02:48,233
Yeah!

1302
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:50,535
That is
what I'm talkin' about.

1303
01:02:51,604 --> 01:02:54,639
So, to make a long story short,

1304
01:02:54,707 --> 01:02:57,075
the Taliban wanted
to get ahold of the flu,

1305
01:02:57,143 --> 01:02:59,644
and ma-na na-na na-na na-na na,
and they were gonna spread it.

1306
01:02:59,712 --> 01:03:01,913
Whatever.
I mean, we stopped them, right?

1307
01:03:01,981 --> 01:03:03,048
We're good.

1308
01:03:03,115 --> 01:03:04,482
Exactly!

1309
01:03:04,550 --> 01:03:05,717
We stopped them...

1310
01:03:05,785 --> 01:03:07,719
so that we could do it
our own way.

1311
01:03:07,787 --> 01:03:09,154
What?

1312
01:03:09,221 --> 01:03:13,124
See, they only wanted to spread
it in the United States,

1313
01:03:13,192 --> 01:03:16,995
but in order to fulfill
the prophecy in Dave's bible,

1314
01:03:17,063 --> 01:03:20,799
We must wipe out
the entire planet.

1315
01:03:20,866 --> 01:03:22,801
He's fucking nuts.

1316
01:03:22,868 --> 01:03:26,471
Which brings us to you,
Mr. Verne Troyer!

1317
01:03:26,539 --> 01:03:29,974
If he wrote anything about me
in that bible,

1318
01:03:30,042 --> 01:03:31,776
we're gonna have
some serious problems.

1319
01:03:31,844 --> 01:03:36,948
"and you shall know when the
final day of reckoning begins

1320
01:03:37,016 --> 01:03:38,950
"because on that day,

1321
01:03:39,018 --> 01:03:41,686
"a tiny entertainer

1322
01:03:41,754 --> 01:03:45,123
will be raped
by 1,000 monkeys!"

1323
01:03:45,191 --> 01:03:47,625
That's it.
I'm gonna kick your fucking ass.

1324
01:03:47,693 --> 01:03:48,827
I'm sorry, little ...

1325
01:03:48,894 --> 01:03:49,861
Ohh!

1326
01:03:49,929 --> 01:03:50,962
Ohh!

1327
01:03:51,030 --> 01:03:53,298
Enough! Enough! Enough!

1328
01:03:53,365 --> 01:03:56,768
Stop him!
We must do as god commands!

1329
01:03:56,836 --> 01:03:58,536
God damn it.

1330
01:03:58,604 --> 01:04:01,339
Bring on the monkeys!

1331
01:04:03,609 --> 01:04:05,977
Oh, not the monkeys.

1332
01:04:08,381 --> 01:04:10,048
Where'd you get
so many monkeys?

1333
01:04:10,116 --> 01:04:11,182
I don't fucking know.

1334
01:04:11,250 --> 01:04:12,684
I got nothing to do
with this shit.

1335
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:15,420
Oh.

1336
01:04:15,488 --> 01:04:16,721
Oh, shit.

1337
01:04:16,789 --> 01:04:18,323
Ohh!

1338
01:04:23,729 --> 01:04:25,830
Don't fuck the pants up, please.

1339
01:04:25,898 --> 01:04:29,834
All in all, this has really
not been a very pleasant day.

1340
01:04:29,902 --> 01:04:31,169
Yeah.
-But...

1341
01:04:35,107 --> 01:04:38,510
Unfortunately, the desperate
nature of our situation

1342
01:04:38,577 --> 01:04:40,912
suggests that we may
need another of us

1343
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:45,583
to embrace martyrdom as we bring
our fight to the Infidels.

1344
01:04:45,651 --> 01:04:46,751
Now...

1345
01:04:50,189 --> 01:04:52,991
How about Abdul?
-Hey, let's go do some drugs.

1346
01:04:54,293 --> 01:04:57,929
Oh, that is a great idea,
a great idea ... genius!

1347
01:04:57,997 --> 01:05:01,700
Of course,
one must agree willingly.

1348
01:05:01,767 --> 01:05:04,269
Now, Abdul...

1349
01:05:04,336 --> 01:05:08,506
If you don't want to be blown
into a tiny million pieces,

1350
01:05:08,574 --> 01:05:12,243
raise your hand, hop on
one foot, and sing "Free Bird."

1351
01:05:16,449 --> 01:05:18,049
Abdul it is.

1352
01:05:18,117 --> 01:05:22,053
Now, if we just had Osama.

1353
01:05:22,121 --> 01:05:25,590
Does anybody know
where the fuck he is?!

1354
01:05:28,127 --> 01:05:31,529
So, you can see that just
by changing the words you use,

1355
01:05:31,597 --> 01:05:34,899
you can motivate your employees
in all new ways.

1356
01:05:34,967 --> 01:05:39,571
If you master my 117 steps
to dominating your employees,

1357
01:05:39,638 --> 01:05:41,706
I personally guarantee
you will have a team

1358
01:05:41,774 --> 01:05:46,444
of little killer bees ready
to live or die at your command.

1359
01:05:46,512 --> 01:05:49,981
You can make them work
for 72 hours straight at a time,

1360
01:05:50,049 --> 01:05:52,784
especially if you put
crystal meth in the water.

1361
01:05:52,852 --> 01:05:55,787
Now, some of you may be asking,
"isn't crystal meth illegal?"

1362
01:05:55,855 --> 01:05:57,355
Technically, yes,

1363
01:05:57,423 --> 01:06:00,525
but the U.S. Air force uses it
to fuel their pilots

1364
01:06:00,593 --> 01:06:02,660
when they're on night missions
over Afghanistan.

1365
01:06:02,728 --> 01:06:06,531
So it can't be that illegal
if the U.S. Air force uses it.

1366
01:06:08,801 --> 01:06:10,835
So...what now?

1367
01:06:10,903 --> 01:06:13,171
So, you're
just gonna shoot us?

1368
01:06:13,239 --> 01:06:17,008
Yeah, you know,
I'm really sorry, man.

1369
01:06:17,076 --> 01:06:19,611
I mean, obviously, this is
some sort of misunderstanding,

1370
01:06:19,678 --> 01:06:21,246
But you can see

1371
01:06:21,313 --> 01:06:24,516
where I kind of have to go
with it at this point. Hmm?

1372
01:06:24,583 --> 01:06:27,252
I mean, you're my nephew,
but these are my people.

1373
01:06:27,319 --> 01:06:29,687
Got to lead them
to the Promised Land.

1374
01:06:29,755 --> 01:06:31,089
You're a douche.

1375
01:06:31,157 --> 01:06:33,792
Not.
-Yeah.

1376
01:06:33,859 --> 01:06:37,529
Actually, the bible
doesn't say to kill you.

1377
01:06:41,133 --> 01:06:43,668
What the fuck, Richie?

1378
01:06:43,736 --> 01:06:44,803
Come on, what?

1379
01:06:44,870 --> 01:06:46,404
I'm ... I'm god on earth,
remember?

1380
01:06:46,472 --> 01:06:47,772
Read your fucking bible.

1381
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:50,742
When you read
between the lines,

1382
01:06:50,810 --> 01:06:54,312
it's remarkable
how the meanings change.

1383
01:06:54,380 --> 01:06:56,147
Now, the way I read it

1384
01:06:56,215 --> 01:07:00,652
was god chose you as a pawn
to get this movement going.

1385
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:04,389
But now it's time for someone
else to take charge...

1386
01:07:04,457 --> 01:07:06,124
someone...

1387
01:07:08,127 --> 01:07:11,329
...who truly believes.

1388
01:07:13,365 --> 01:07:15,033
No, Richie.

1389
01:07:18,137 --> 01:07:19,404
Oh!

1390
01:07:27,313 --> 01:07:28,480
Ugh!

1391
01:07:28,547 --> 01:07:30,582
Ew!

1392
01:07:34,086 --> 01:07:36,888
I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I whoo!

1393
01:07:36,956 --> 01:07:39,758
Whoo! Whoo!

1394
01:07:45,798 --> 01:07:47,065
Fuck!

1395
01:07:47,133 --> 01:07:49,000
Fuck me!

1396
01:07:49,068 --> 01:07:51,336
I'm fucking gay!

1397
01:07:51,404 --> 01:07:52,904
Who the fuck knew?

1398
01:07:52,972 --> 01:07:55,673
I had no clue, man,
but this explains a lot.

1399
01:07:55,741 --> 01:07:59,711
Oh, I can finally learn
to love myself for who I am.

1400
01:07:59,779 --> 01:08:02,080
I'm a fucking chubby chaser,
too!

1401
01:08:02,148 --> 01:08:03,515
Fuck it, man!

1402
01:08:03,582 --> 01:08:05,383
This is great.

1403
01:08:05,451 --> 01:08:06,484
Aww!

1404
01:08:06,552 --> 01:08:08,319
You know what?

1405
01:08:08,387 --> 01:08:10,955
Today is the start
of my whole new life.

1406
01:08:11,023 --> 01:08:12,690
Right.

1407
01:08:14,026 --> 01:08:16,027
Aah!

1408
01:08:21,901 --> 01:08:22,967
Mitzi.

1409
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:30,408
Okay, so I'm bi.

1410
01:08:34,413 --> 01:08:35,880
Yuck!

1411
01:08:38,384 --> 01:08:39,484
You.

1412
01:08:41,454 --> 01:08:44,556
You we are grateful to,

1413
01:08:44,623 --> 01:08:47,792
so we will let you live...

1414
01:08:47,860 --> 01:08:51,496
Until the bird flu gets you.

1415
01:08:51,564 --> 01:08:55,133
Or we can put you out of your
misery right now ... either way!

1416
01:08:55,201 --> 01:08:58,069
Actually...

1417
01:09:00,439 --> 01:09:01,639
Actually...

1418
01:09:01,707 --> 01:09:03,475
Uh, no.

1419
01:09:03,542 --> 01:09:08,713
Um, you have
to leave me alive...

1420
01:09:08,781 --> 01:09:10,181
Richie...

1421
01:09:10,249 --> 01:09:15,954
if you want to have
your little...Apocalypse.

1422
01:09:16,021 --> 01:09:18,857
And why is that?

1423
01:09:18,924 --> 01:09:22,894
Uh, because I am the only guy

1424
01:09:22,962 --> 01:09:28,533
who knows where the truck
filled with bird flu is parked.

1425
01:09:36,675 --> 01:09:38,443
Yeah! That's clever!

1426
01:09:38,511 --> 01:09:39,778
That is clever!

1427
01:09:39,845 --> 01:09:43,348
But it's
not insurmountable.

1428
01:09:43,416 --> 01:09:45,283
You didn't go far.

1429
01:09:45,351 --> 01:09:47,385
We'll just find it ourselves,

1430
01:09:47,453 --> 01:09:49,754
and then we'll kill you!

1431
01:09:49,822 --> 01:09:52,490
Or not, remember?

1432
01:09:52,558 --> 01:09:55,393
The bible said that
you didn't have to kill me,

1433
01:09:55,461 --> 01:09:57,095
And you said
you weren't going to,

1434
01:09:57,163 --> 01:09:58,963
And you killed Dave.

1435
01:09:59,031 --> 01:10:02,000
Yeah, but as soon
as I said that, I just ...

1436
01:10:02,068 --> 01:10:05,203
it just was a lousy idea,
so ha-ha.

1437
01:10:05,271 --> 01:10:08,006
We'll be right back.

1438
01:10:10,576 --> 01:10:11,976
Get in there!

1439
01:10:24,990 --> 01:10:26,024
Aah. Aah.

1440
01:11:14,573 --> 01:11:16,041
What are you still doing here?

1441
01:11:16,108 --> 01:11:18,043
We're supposed to wait
for Richard

1442
01:11:18,110 --> 01:11:19,744
to get back
with the truck.

1443
01:11:19,812 --> 01:11:22,380
And then we eat
the poison brownies

1444
01:11:22,448 --> 01:11:25,650
and ascend into god's love.

1445
01:11:25,718 --> 01:11:27,452
Starr couldn't wait.

1446
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:29,154
She was on a cleanse.

1447
01:11:29,221 --> 01:11:31,656
Yeah, that all
sounds like a real good plan.

1448
01:11:33,025 --> 01:11:35,326
Me ...

1449
01:11:35,394 --> 01:11:37,929
I'm gonna go upstairs...

1450
01:11:37,997 --> 01:11:39,764
kill me some terrorists...

1451
01:11:39,832 --> 01:11:43,268
probably die
in a hail of bullets.

1452
01:11:43,335 --> 01:11:47,005
If by some miracle
I make it out alive,

1453
01:11:47,073 --> 01:11:50,275
I'm gonna find that fat fuck
of yours, Richard,

1454
01:11:50,342 --> 01:11:54,412
and stick this machine gun
up his self-righteous ass.

1455
01:11:56,515 --> 01:11:58,616
Yeah.

1456
01:11:58,684 --> 01:12:00,785
Decisions, decisions.

1457
01:12:14,133 --> 01:12:17,335
Uh-oh.

1458
01:12:24,577 --> 01:12:26,111
Aah!

1459
01:12:30,383 --> 01:12:32,183
Mine.

1460
01:12:32,885 --> 01:12:34,152
Mine.

1461
01:12:34,220 --> 01:12:35,687
What?
-Yours.

1462
01:12:37,790 --> 01:12:39,090
Aww!

1463
01:12:40,059 --> 01:12:41,393
Oh, you are good.

1464
01:12:41,460 --> 01:12:43,061
Well, you are better.
-I know.

1465
01:12:43,129 --> 01:12:44,562
Come on.

1466
01:12:46,165 --> 01:12:47,966
Aah!

1467
01:12:48,034 --> 01:12:49,501
Let's go.

1468
01:12:50,770 --> 01:12:53,638
You cunning little bitch.

1469
01:12:53,706 --> 01:12:55,840
You're not retarded,
are you?

1470
01:12:55,908 --> 01:12:57,742
You've just been faking it.

1471
01:13:02,248 --> 01:13:03,248
Mine.

1472
01:13:03,315 --> 01:13:04,783
Aah!

1473
01:13:09,722 --> 01:13:10,889
They'll meet us later.

1474
01:13:18,497 --> 01:13:20,231
All right, ladies.

1475
01:13:20,299 --> 01:13:21,633
This is
where we split up.

1476
01:13:21,701 --> 01:13:22,701
Aw.

1477
01:13:22,768 --> 01:13:24,002
Go home
to your families.

1478
01:13:24,070 --> 01:13:25,804
Think for yourselves,

1479
01:13:25,871 --> 01:13:27,706
And no more crazy cults

1480
01:13:27,773 --> 01:13:29,374
that look forward
to the end of the world.

1481
01:13:29,442 --> 01:13:30,942
Don't worry.

1482
01:13:31,010 --> 01:13:33,378
We've decided to be Christians
from now on.

1483
01:13:33,446 --> 01:13:35,213
Well...

1484
01:13:45,458 --> 01:13:47,959
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

1485
01:13:48,027 --> 01:13:49,994
Hold on.
Hold on.

1486
01:13:50,062 --> 01:13:51,029
Why?

1487
01:13:51,097 --> 01:13:52,263
Because you're married?

1488
01:13:52,331 --> 01:13:55,533
No, I just want
to give Karen a turn.

1489
01:13:55,601 --> 01:13:57,135
Oh!

1490
01:13:57,203 --> 01:13:58,503
Hey.
-Hi!

1491
01:14:00,873 --> 01:14:02,273
Oh, my God.

1492
01:14:15,321 --> 01:14:18,390
Paradise, here I come.

1493
01:14:22,895 --> 01:14:25,096
Speaking of wild shit,

1494
01:14:25,164 --> 01:14:27,966
have you seen
that guy's wife?

1495
01:14:28,034 --> 01:14:29,934
Yeah, she's hard to miss.

1496
01:14:30,002 --> 01:14:31,002
Yeah.

1497
01:14:32,671 --> 01:14:35,273
She's a good fuck, though.

1498
01:14:35,341 --> 01:14:37,409
You fucked her?

1499
01:14:37,476 --> 01:14:39,277
Several times.

1500
01:14:39,345 --> 01:14:40,845
She's got a clapper
in her trailer.

1501
01:14:40,913 --> 01:14:44,015
The lights go on and off
and on and off.

1502
01:14:45,251 --> 01:14:47,318
Makes you feel
like a rock star!

1503
01:14:47,386 --> 01:14:49,020
Let's go to the trailer.

1504
01:14:49,088 --> 01:14:50,622
Aw, right.

1505
01:14:58,364 --> 01:15:00,198
Hey,
it's the Postal Dude!

1506
01:15:00,266 --> 01:15:01,299
Get him!

1507
01:15:05,237 --> 01:15:06,938
Go! Go! Go!

1508
01:15:16,849 --> 01:15:18,083
Come on!

1509
01:15:18,150 --> 01:15:19,317
Go! Go!

1510
01:15:26,625 --> 01:15:28,093
Unh!

1511
01:15:39,939 --> 01:15:40,905
Come on.
-Shoot him!

1512
01:15:40,973 --> 01:15:42,006
Eat this!

1513
01:15:44,377 --> 01:15:45,910
I'm sorry!

1514
01:15:47,079 --> 01:15:48,346
Bye, cowards!

1515
01:15:49,915 --> 01:15:54,219
Aah!

1516
01:16:25,618 --> 01:16:27,752
You are so hot.

1517
01:16:27,820 --> 01:16:30,455
And you turned
into a crazy psychopath.

1518
01:16:30,523 --> 01:16:33,792
There were
some pretty good reasons.

1519
01:16:33,859 --> 01:16:35,693
That's what they all say.

1520
01:16:35,761 --> 01:16:39,497
I have to destroy a postal truck
filled with lethal microbes

1521
01:16:39,565 --> 01:16:41,533
before a doomsday cult
or a terrorist group

1522
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:43,835
Gets their hands on it
and destroys the entire world.

1523
01:16:43,903 --> 01:16:45,737
Yeah, like I believe that.

1524
01:16:45,805 --> 01:16:47,539
Jihad!

1525
01:16:47,606 --> 01:16:50,175
Huh?
-Jihad!

1526
01:16:53,512 --> 01:16:55,780
Okay.
Uh, where's that truck?

1527
01:17:02,488 --> 01:17:03,555
Great.

1528
01:17:03,622 --> 01:17:05,323
Okay.

1529
01:17:07,927 --> 01:17:11,563
Oh.
I'm sorry, Mr. Laden.

1530
01:17:11,630 --> 01:17:14,091
It looks like your credit
card's been declined.

1531
01:17:14,092 --> 01:17:14,399
What?

1532
01:17:14,467 --> 01:17:17,268
It looks like every
free government on the planet

1533
01:17:17,336 --> 01:17:19,471
has frozen your assets.

1534
01:17:19,538 --> 01:17:20,772
Would you take a check?

1535
01:17:22,174 --> 01:17:23,775
Cash, American.

1536
01:17:23,843 --> 01:17:25,276
I'm a little short.

1537
01:17:25,344 --> 01:17:28,213
Sammy, we need you
right away.

1538
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:29,714
Do you have any cash?

1539
01:17:29,782 --> 01:17:31,816
No.

1540
01:17:35,020 --> 01:17:36,654
Run!

1541
01:17:36,722 --> 01:17:39,124
Freakin' Arabs.

1542
01:17:39,191 --> 01:17:41,926
Go back to Mecca and run around
your big black box!

1543
01:17:44,830 --> 01:17:46,765
Oh, god.
-You okay?

1544
01:17:46,832 --> 01:17:48,733
Yeah, you ever get
like a hangnail?

1545
01:17:48,801 --> 01:17:50,502
Yeah, it's brutal.
-Aah!

1546
01:17:52,304 --> 01:17:53,938
What the hell was that?

1547
01:17:56,308 --> 01:17:57,275
Fuck her, Greg.

1548
01:17:57,343 --> 01:17:59,144
Yeah, come on.
Fuck her, Greg.

1549
01:17:59,211 --> 01:18:01,513
How's that, huh?

1550
01:18:01,580 --> 01:18:03,748
A little to the left,
motherfucker.

1551
01:18:03,816 --> 01:18:04,916
Oh.

1552
01:18:04,984 --> 01:18:05,917
Yeah.

1553
01:18:05,985 --> 01:18:07,452
Oh, okay.
Oh! Okay!

1554
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:08,686
You're right.
You're right.

1555
01:18:10,256 --> 01:18:12,857
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.

1556
01:18:12,925 --> 01:18:14,559
There you go.
Oh!

1557
01:18:14,627 --> 01:18:15,660
Oh, yeah!

1558
01:18:15,728 --> 01:18:17,495
Yes!

1559
01:18:17,563 --> 01:18:19,030
oh!

1560
01:18:20,633 --> 01:18:23,134
Yes!
Give it to me.

1561
01:18:23,202 --> 01:18:24,135
Whoo-hoo!

1562
01:18:24,203 --> 01:18:26,304
Who is that?
Ugh.

1563
01:18:26,372 --> 01:18:28,506
My soon-to-be-ex-wife.

1564
01:18:28,574 --> 01:18:29,507
Oh.

1565
01:18:29,575 --> 01:18:31,576
Yeah! Yeah!

1566
01:18:31,644 --> 01:18:32,677
Yeah! Yeah!

1567
01:18:32,745 --> 01:18:33,678
Oh, yeah!

1568
01:18:33,746 --> 01:18:34,679
You like that?
-Yes!

1569
01:18:34,747 --> 01:18:37,015
Great job!
A little faster.

1570
01:18:37,083 --> 01:18:40,685
That ought to do it.

1571
01:18:43,322 --> 01:18:44,656
All right.

1572
01:18:44,724 --> 01:18:46,157
Here, champ!
Come on, buddy.

1573
01:18:46,225 --> 01:18:48,560
Champ?

1574
01:18:48,627 --> 01:18:50,095
Come on!

1575
01:18:50,162 --> 01:18:51,696
Ah, poop.

1576
01:18:51,764 --> 01:18:53,732
Let's get out of here.

1577
01:18:53,799 --> 01:18:55,066
All right.

1578
01:18:59,739 --> 01:19:01,072
Too late.

1579
01:19:03,509 --> 01:19:05,510
Whoo-hoo!

1580
01:19:07,179 --> 01:19:08,513
What the fuck was that?

1581
01:19:11,217 --> 01:19:15,220
Fucking guy!
We're gonna fucking mess you up!

1582
01:19:16,088 --> 01:19:18,089
Back! Back!

1583
01:19:18,157 --> 01:19:19,724
Fucking die!

1584
01:19:19,792 --> 01:19:22,927
Shoot that motherfucker down!

1585
01:19:22,995 --> 01:19:25,029
I love you, Greggie.
I love you, too.

1586
01:19:31,670 --> 01:19:33,538
Go back!
Go back!

1587
01:19:43,983 --> 01:19:45,917
Let's do it!
All right!

1588
01:19:52,058 --> 01:19:53,091
Hey!

1589
01:19:54,794 --> 01:19:56,694
God damn it!

1590
01:19:56,762 --> 01:20:00,165
Get the hell off my property!

1591
01:20:03,903 --> 01:20:06,671
Motherfucking piece of shit!

1592
01:20:12,078 --> 01:20:15,447
Hand over the Avian Flu,
Infidel!

1593
01:20:17,817 --> 01:20:21,519
Hello?

1594
01:20:21,587 --> 01:20:23,288
That's their truck, right?

1595
01:20:29,895 --> 01:20:31,496
Oh, there he is...

1596
01:20:31,564 --> 01:20:33,131
the guy
who killed Uncle Dave.

1597
01:20:35,768 --> 01:20:37,435
We must
rebalance our energies

1598
01:20:37,503 --> 01:20:39,838
by cutting out his spleen!

1599
01:20:44,877 --> 01:20:46,778
Okay.

1600
01:20:46,846 --> 01:20:47,879
Fuck this.

1601
01:20:47,947 --> 01:20:49,214
Uh-huh.

1602
01:20:49,281 --> 01:20:50,315
Bomb!

1603
01:20:50,383 --> 01:20:52,484
Bomb!

1604
01:20:52,551 --> 01:20:53,651
Bomb!

1605
01:20:53,719 --> 01:20:55,887
B-b-b-b-bomb!
Bomb!

1606
01:20:55,955 --> 01:20:57,555
Hold up!
Fuck!

1607
01:20:59,859 --> 01:21:04,696
"big bomb that could take out
a whole city block" bomb.

1608
01:21:06,832 --> 01:21:10,068
Do I have your attention?

1609
01:21:23,249 --> 01:21:24,315
Get down here!

1610
01:21:24,383 --> 01:21:27,786
What is wrong with you people?

1611
01:21:27,853 --> 01:21:31,656
You're so busy trying to blow up
the world in the name of God.

1612
01:21:31,724 --> 01:21:33,992
News flash, fucktards ...

1613
01:21:34,060 --> 01:21:36,361
God doesn't need your help.

1614
01:21:36,429 --> 01:21:39,364
He's God!

1615
01:21:39,432 --> 01:21:44,069
And he, she, it ...

1616
01:21:44,136 --> 01:21:46,538
they gave you life.

1617
01:21:46,605 --> 01:21:50,442
And you're wasting it.

1618
01:21:50,509 --> 01:21:52,944
Look around you.

1619
01:21:53,012 --> 01:21:54,079
Look.

1620
01:21:55,314 --> 01:21:57,382
Look, God damn it!

1621
01:22:02,621 --> 01:22:04,856
See?

1622
01:22:04,924 --> 01:22:08,093
We're not that different

1623
01:22:08,160 --> 01:22:12,230
'cause we all come
from the same family...

1624
01:22:12,298 --> 01:22:14,966
known as humanity.

1625
01:22:16,869 --> 01:22:19,371
Now, what do families do?

1626
01:22:19,438 --> 01:22:20,572
Do they fight?

1627
01:22:20,639 --> 01:22:22,741
Yeah, sure.

1628
01:22:22,808 --> 01:22:26,444
But they work it out
'cause they love each other,

1629
01:22:26,512 --> 01:22:29,414
and they know that
they're stuck with each other,

1630
01:22:29,482 --> 01:22:30,949
just like all of us are,

1631
01:22:31,016 --> 01:22:36,388
here on the crazy big mud ball

1632
01:22:36,455 --> 01:22:38,223
called Earth.

1633
01:22:42,395 --> 01:22:44,896
So, come on, people.

1634
01:22:44,964 --> 01:22:49,501
Let's try and find
some common ground, huh?

1635
01:22:49,568 --> 01:22:52,737
Uh, well,
we all hate Jews!

1636
01:22:54,240 --> 01:22:55,306
Yeah.

1637
01:22:55,374 --> 01:22:57,242
Yeah, well,
everybody knows that, yeah.

1638
01:22:57,309 --> 01:23:00,578
No, no, no, no,
not a hate thing.

1639
01:23:00,646 --> 01:23:01,679
Ah, sh ...

1640
01:23:01,747 --> 01:23:03,982
A happy thing.

1641
01:23:04,050 --> 01:23:05,517
I don't get it.

1642
01:23:05,584 --> 01:23:10,955
I think it's time
to empty our hands of guns

1643
01:23:11,023 --> 01:23:13,825
so we can fill our hands

1644
01:23:13,893 --> 01:23:16,594
with hugs.

1645
01:23:22,702 --> 01:23:26,604
If you want to waste this
precious gift we call life,

1646
01:23:26,672 --> 01:23:29,340
I can't stop you.

1647
01:23:32,545 --> 01:23:34,379
So, go ahead.

1648
01:23:34,447 --> 01:23:36,381
Shoot.

1649
01:23:36,449 --> 01:23:37,916
Or...

1650
01:23:42,054 --> 01:23:43,788
...hug.

1651
01:23:47,359 --> 01:23:49,160
Shoot him.

1652
01:23:50,329 --> 01:23:51,996
Oh, you motherfuckers!

1653
01:23:59,138 --> 01:24:00,839
God damn!

1654
01:24:07,480 --> 01:24:08,813
Aah!

1655
01:24:16,222 --> 01:24:17,756
I'm starting to get pissed.

1656
01:24:22,495 --> 01:24:23,862
Greggie, I'm still wet,
though!

1657
01:24:23,929 --> 01:24:26,398
Just plug that little thing in.
I'll be there in one second.

1658
01:24:26,465 --> 01:24:27,432
Ugh!

1659
01:24:41,580 --> 01:24:44,949
You've got
to be fucking kidding me.

1660
01:24:47,820 --> 01:24:50,688
Aah!

1661
01:24:50,756 --> 01:24:54,192
Aah!

1662
01:24:54,260 --> 01:24:55,727
You like that?

1663
01:25:09,442 --> 01:25:13,144
Aah!

1664
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:17,615
Hey, Mo,
save some virgins for me.

1665
01:25:28,994 --> 01:25:31,062
Aah!

1666
01:25:38,671 --> 01:25:41,272
Please insert
an additional 25 cents

1667
01:25:41,340 --> 01:25:43,808
to complete
your long-distance call.

1668
01:25:57,857 --> 01:25:59,691
Hello,
this is George W. Bush.

1669
01:25:59,759 --> 01:26:00,859
It's Osama.

1670
01:26:00,926 --> 01:26:02,627
I need some help, man!

1671
01:26:02,695 --> 01:26:03,695
Hi, there, Osama.

1672
01:26:03,763 --> 01:26:04,829
How are you?

1673
01:26:04,897 --> 01:26:06,064
You got to speak up,
George.

1674
01:26:06,132 --> 01:26:08,099
I can't hear you over the gunfire.
-Hmm?

1675
01:26:08,167 --> 01:26:11,036
Gunfire. I'm trapped in
a trailer park in Paradise city.

1676
01:26:11,103 --> 01:26:13,204
I'm here for you, buddy.

1677
01:26:13,272 --> 01:26:14,973
We got you on satellite.

1678
01:26:15,041 --> 01:26:17,108
Should I send a couple
cruise missiles down there?

1679
01:26:17,176 --> 01:26:18,343
Uh-oh.

1680
01:26:20,112 --> 01:26:21,513
No, I ...

1681
01:26:21,580 --> 01:26:24,215
Please insert
an additional 25 cents

1682
01:26:24,283 --> 01:26:26,918
to continue
your long-distance call.

1683
01:26:28,754 --> 01:26:32,624
I was thinking maybe
a helicopter to come pick me up.

1684
01:26:32,691 --> 01:26:34,592
Hey, that ... that could work.

1685
01:26:34,660 --> 01:26:36,728
Uh, there's a field
just south of you.

1686
01:26:36,796 --> 01:26:38,496
I'll pick you up there.

1687
01:26:38,564 --> 01:26:40,632
Aw, thanks, Georgie.

1688
01:26:40,700 --> 01:26:41,666
I, um...

1689
01:26:41,734 --> 01:26:43,868
Yes?

1690
01:26:43,936 --> 01:26:45,470
I just wish
I knew how to quit you.

1691
01:27:02,922 --> 01:27:03,855
Shit.

1692
01:27:07,893 --> 01:27:09,194
Oh!

1693
01:27:13,799 --> 01:27:16,101
No hand-to-hand combat,
no hand-to-hand combat.

1694
01:27:22,141 --> 01:27:23,842
No, no, no, no.

1695
01:27:32,585 --> 01:27:33,585
Hello.

1696
01:27:33,652 --> 01:27:37,155
Internal Revenue Service,
Frank Dumont.

1697
01:27:37,223 --> 01:27:40,425
We're here to conduct an audit
on a Mr. David Clark.

1698
01:27:40,493 --> 01:27:44,095
You are
American government?

1699
01:27:44,163 --> 01:27:46,398
Yes, sir.
Is Mr. Clark at home?

1700
01:27:46,465 --> 01:27:49,534
Hold on one moment,
government man.

1701
01:27:49,602 --> 01:27:52,504
I have someone
to speak to you.

1702
01:27:56,609 --> 01:27:58,643
Unauthorized fruit sales.

1703
01:27:58,711 --> 01:28:00,111
I should have brought that dip.

1704
01:28:04,383 --> 01:28:06,317
Jihad!
Jihad!

1705
01:28:06,385 --> 01:28:08,153
Ji ... oh, yeah.

1706
01:28:08,220 --> 01:28:09,320
Jihad, yeah.

1707
01:28:09,388 --> 01:28:12,157
Abdul!

1708
01:28:12,224 --> 01:28:15,393
Abdul, where is your belt?

1709
01:28:15,461 --> 01:28:18,096
You're not wearing
your explosive belt.

1710
01:28:22,668 --> 01:28:25,103
We're taking
the cop car.

1711
01:28:31,644 --> 01:28:32,644
Abdul.

1712
01:28:34,747 --> 01:28:36,381
Lorraine, Lorraine...

1713
01:28:36,449 --> 01:28:37,982
Stop licking
your own asshole, okay?

1714
01:28:38,050 --> 01:28:39,184
You're my publisher.

1715
01:28:39,251 --> 01:28:40,952
You tell them
that this is a prime example

1716
01:28:41,020 --> 01:28:42,620
of why everybody
should buy my book,

1717
01:28:42,688 --> 01:28:44,889
"how to fire an employee
without making him go postal" ...

1718
01:28:44,957 --> 01:28:46,224
Because I'm a ...

1719
01:28:52,965 --> 01:28:54,666
Aah!

1720
01:29:00,406 --> 01:29:03,441
Aah!

1721
01:29:03,509 --> 01:29:05,643
You ruined everything!

1722
01:29:06,846 --> 01:29:07,946
Oh.

1723
01:29:08,013 --> 01:29:10,382
Oh, shit!
Oh, shit!

1724
01:29:10,449 --> 01:29:12,851
Don't be a dick...

1725
01:29:12,918 --> 01:29:13,885
No!

1726
01:29:13,953 --> 01:29:16,020
...dick.

1727
01:29:33,706 --> 01:29:35,740
At an Alabama high school today...

1728
01:29:35,808 --> 01:29:38,543
Did you ... champ!

1729
01:29:38,611 --> 01:29:39,611
Hey, buddy.

1730
01:29:39,678 --> 01:29:42,747
Hey! Hey!

1731
01:29:42,815 --> 01:29:44,082
I thought
I smelled poo-poo breath.

1732
01:29:44,150 --> 01:29:46,818
...garbage duty
for a week as punishment.

1733
01:29:46,886 --> 01:29:48,720
Nice to see you, pal.

1734
01:29:48,788 --> 01:29:50,855
We're interrupting
our regular broadcast

1735
01:29:50,923 --> 01:29:53,458
to take you live
for this emergency announcement

1736
01:29:53,526 --> 01:29:55,460
from the President.

1737
01:29:57,797 --> 01:29:59,064
This is the President

1738
01:29:59,131 --> 01:30:00,565
of the United States of America.

1739
01:30:02,068 --> 01:30:03,768
C.I.A. Intelligence
has confirmed

1740
01:30:03,836 --> 01:30:06,404
that the governments
of China and India

1741
01:30:06,472 --> 01:30:09,274
were directly responsible
for the terrorist cell

1742
01:30:09,341 --> 01:30:13,445
recently uncovered in Paradise.

1743
01:30:13,512 --> 01:30:18,683
Worse still, they continue to
make T-shirts for well under $1.

1744
01:30:18,751 --> 01:30:21,019
In response, we've been forced

1745
01:30:21,087 --> 01:30:24,522
to destroy both countries
with "nucular" force.

1746
01:30:24,590 --> 01:30:28,159
China, despite
all our freedom-loving efforts,

1747
01:30:28,227 --> 01:30:31,863
was able to send
30 atomic warheads our way.

1748
01:30:35,634 --> 01:30:39,304
They should hit
in a little under two minutes.

1749
01:30:39,372 --> 01:30:43,274
I wish you all the best of luck
with your future endeavors,

1750
01:30:43,342 --> 01:30:45,577
and God Bless America.

1751
01:30:53,352 --> 01:30:55,053
Well?

1752
01:30:59,225 --> 01:31:01,192
I regret nothing.

1753
01:31:01,260 --> 01:31:03,428
You know what?
Forget the stuff.

1754
01:31:03,496 --> 01:31:04,896
Oh!
-What are you doing?

1755
01:31:04,964 --> 01:31:07,232
Don't you want me
to get out of here? Come on!

1756
01:31:07,299 --> 01:31:08,800
Come on!

1757
01:31:08,868 --> 01:31:10,668
Come on.

1758
01:31:12,204 --> 01:31:14,406
Go out!

1759
01:31:32,358 --> 01:31:34,426
Ugh.

1760
01:31:34,493 --> 01:31:35,660
They got a hu ...

1761
01:31:36,929 --> 01:31:38,363
Oh, god!

1762
01:31:53,279 --> 01:31:58,750
# oo-oo-oo-ooh #

1763
01:31:58,818 --> 01:32:04,856
# oo-oo-oo-ooh #

1764
01:32:04,924 --> 01:32:10,361
# hand in hand, we'll stroll the
land in the peace and harmony #

1765
01:32:10,429 --> 01:32:13,031
# we'll be friends
till the end #

1766
01:32:13,099 --> 01:32:14,899
# buddies, you and me #

1767
01:32:14,967 --> 01:32:17,335
Georgie, I think
this is the beginning

1768
01:32:17,403 --> 01:32:18,803
of a beautiful friendship

1769
01:32:18,871 --> 01:32:21,406
# flowers all around #

1770
01:32:21,474 --> 01:32:23,875
# from the birth
of mother earth #

1771
01:32:23,943 --> 01:32:27,011
# we hear the magic sound,
singing #

1772
01:32:27,079 --> 01:32:32,517
# oo-oo-oo-ooh #

1773
01:32:32,585 --> 01:32:37,956
# oo-oo-oo-ooh #

1774
01:32:38,023 --> 01:32:40,959
# devils cast into the sea #

1775
01:32:41,026 --> 01:32:43,395
# brothers without love #

1776
01:32:43,462 --> 01:32:46,498
# ripple to a tidal wave #

1777
01:32:46,565 --> 01:32:49,334
# swelling to a flood #

1778
01:32:49,402 --> 01:32:52,237
# brave the storm,
you lonesome ships #

1779
01:32:52,304 --> 01:32:54,839
# courage, it's not far #

1780
01:32:54,907 --> 01:32:56,408
# sail away #

1781
01:32:56,475 --> 01:33:00,678
# we'll find a day in the land
of la-la-la, singing #

1782
01:33:00,746 --> 01:33:06,051
# oo-oo-oo-ooh #

1783
01:33:06,118 --> 01:33:11,723
# oo-oo-oo-ooh #

1784
01:33:11,791 --> 01:33:17,195
# oo-oo-oo-ooh #

1785
01:33:17,263 --> 01:33:22,967
# oo-oo-oo-ooh #

1786
01:33:23,035 --> 01:33:28,606
# oo-oo-oo-ooh #

1787
01:33:28,674 --> 01:33:33,912
# oo-oo-oo-ooh #

1788
01:33:47,827 --> 01:33:50,862
# tree of life bearing fruit #

1789
01:33:50,930 --> 01:33:53,465
