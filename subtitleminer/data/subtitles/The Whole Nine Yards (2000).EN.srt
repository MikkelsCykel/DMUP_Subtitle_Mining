00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,452
- I need money.
- Yes, it is a lovely morning, isn't it?

2
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:00,048
The sun is shining, the birds are chirping.

3
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,419
Only dentist I know who can't make money.

4
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,656
Oh, really? What about her father?

5
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:09,092
As a dentist,
my husband was very successful.

6
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:12,257
- It was just that other stuff.
- Yes, there's a word for that.

7
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:14,336
It's called embezzlement.

8
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:18,298
Speaking of which,
how much do you need, dear?

9
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,812
- Five should probably do it.
- Thousand? For what?

10
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,980
You know what? Your father would be proud.

11
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,932
I'll... see what I can do. In the meantime,
you ladies have a lovely day.

12
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,180
I would... if you'd do me a favour and die!

13
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,611
Life is driving you to drink

14
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:41,610
You sit around wondering just what to think

15
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,856
Well, I got some consolation

16
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,134
I'll give it to you if I might

17
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,016
You know, I don't worry 'bout a thing

18
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:55,450
Cos I know nothing's gonna be all right

19
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:02,777
You know, this world
is just one big trouble spot

20
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:06,929
Cos some have plenty and some have not

21
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:09,016
You know, I used to be troubled

22
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,815
But I finally saw the light

23
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,172
Now I don't worry 'bout a thing

24
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:21,373
Cos I know nothing's going to be all right

25
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:28,290
Don't waste your time
trying to be a go-getter

26
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,937
Things'll get worse
before they get any better

27
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,255
You know, there's always somebody

28
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,496
Playin' with dynamite

29
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,696
But I don't worry 'bout a thing

30
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:46,369
Cos I know nothing's going to be all right

31
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,770
Excuse me. Are you threatening me?

32
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,732
I didn't think so.
Look, I changed my mind, OK?

33
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,571
Yes, I'll get you your money back.

34
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:05,898
Oui, oui madame DuPré. Mardi à trois heures.

35
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,778
Oui. A bientôt.

36
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,976
Morning, Doctor.

37
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,931
OK. Good news, Monsieur Boulez.

38
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,494
We're not gonna pull the tooth.
We'll just drill.

39
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,656
Ecoutez-moi, docteur. No drill.

40
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,736
- No drill?
- No drill.

41
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:27,332
I hate the drill. So you just gas me, pull
the tooth out and we'll still be friends. OK?

42
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,052
Good!

43
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:38,976
- I just want a hamburger and fries.
- I'm gonna have a hamburger

44
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,091
- with no mayonnaise this time.
- No?

45
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,973
No mayonnaise. Not at all. OK?

46
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:49,295
- She's gonna put mayonnaise on it.
- Do you mind if I say something?

47
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:51,690
Leave the bitch.

48
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:55,054
- Excuse me?
- Your wife. Leave her.

49
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,171
Find somebody else and just start over.

50
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,894
- Jill...
- Oz, look. I know it's none of my business.

51
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:03,057
I know I've only been working
for you for three weeks.

52
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:07,970
But I'm just telling you what I see, mister.
Your wife is not a good person.

53
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:12,412
- You're expecting an argument?
- So why torture yourself? Just divorce her!

54
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:16,738
I can't afford to. She'd take me to the
cleaners. I'm already paying her father's debt.

55
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:20,939
So she's gonna ride it out till Daddy's
debt gets paid. She's just charming.

56
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,694
She can't help it. Her mother...

57
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:26,653
What's a nice way of... Her... It's...

58
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,532
Well, she's the Antichrist.

59
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:33,856
You know, you'd be doing the world
a favour if you'd just have her whacked.

60
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:39,293
- You know somebody who would do this?
- Present company excluded?

61
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,411
- Voilà.
- Merci.

62
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:44,054
Talking hypothetically
or shall I name a price?

63
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:47,490
You should talk to my wife.
You'd make a fortune.

64
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,975
- What makes you say that?
- Life insurance.

65
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,819
I'm worth more dead than alive.

66
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:20,173
Yeah, just, dining room.
Take the plastic junk off of there.

67
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,416
Can you move any slower than this, fellas?

68
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:27,218
Hi! You must be our new neighbour.
I'm Nicholas Oseransky. Call me Oz.

69
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,416
- Jimmy.
- Hi.

70
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,496
Jimmy Jones.

71
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,897
- Have we met before?
- No.

72
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:38,409
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

73
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:42,499
- I'd remember. I got a thing with faces.
- You look familiar. Where are you from?

74
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,770
Mr Jones, where do you want this?

75
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,456
Order! Order!

76
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:17,538
Upstairs, back bedroom.
What were you saying?

77
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:24,016
- You all right?
- Yes.

78
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:27,576
You sure? Because you look...
like you got some gas.

79
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,695
I-I-I had a hamburger for lunch.

80
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,216
- They put mayonnaise on it?
- Yes.

81
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:36,376
Can you tell me why they do that?

82
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:41,889
Every red-blooded American knows the only
condiment you ever put on a hamburger

83
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,976
is ketchup!

84
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:48,568
Or maybe some of that special sauce
you like so much here in Canada!

85
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,656
Which I think has mayonnaise in it too!

86
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:54,614
But when they slap that mayonnaise
on there, I could kill somebody!

87
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,499
I really, really didn't wanna upset you.

88
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:01,056
Who's upset?
I'm just having a conversation here.

89
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,938
- I'm gonna go home.
- OK.

90
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:09,016
- Feel better.
- Thank you.

91
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,410
- Oz!
- Yes!

92
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:20,013
Thanks for stopping by...
welcoming me to the neighbourhood.

93
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,616
OK.

94
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,495
Pack up! Pack up! We're leaving.

95
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,576
Jesus!

96
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,738
Jesus! I just bumped into
our new next-door neighbour.

97
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:44,250
- Do you have any idea who that is?
- I suppose you're going to tell me.

98
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,496
That's Jimmy the Tulip Tudeski.

99
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:51,171
- And that means something?
- He was a hit man for the Gogolak gang!

100
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:56,059
The Gogolak gang! The Hungarian gang
back in Chicago that ran the North Side?

101
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:59,650
That guy Jimmy was
Lazlo Gogolak's key enforcer!

102
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:13,729
- Sexy!
- Sophie, the man's killed 17 people.

103
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,536
- Why the stupid name?
- The Tulip?

104
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:20,619
That's his flower of choice.
It's what he sent to his victims' funerals.

105
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:23,459
- I wonder what he's doing here?
- Hiding out, most likely.

106
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:27,334
He ratted out Lazlo Gogolak. Lazlo's
spending the rest of his life in prison.

107
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:32,011
Jimmy only got five years.
Dave told me he refused witness protection.

108
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:35,337
- Protection from?
- I'm sure Lazlo's son Janni wants to put

109
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:38,452
one of those... you know, a price on his head.

110
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,136
You mean a... a contract?

111
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,016
A mob contract?

112
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:12,653
- Feelin' better?
- Yes, thank you.

113
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,812
- Let's go for a drive.
- A drive?

114
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:18,170
- Yeah, a drive.
- Well...

115
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,336
I don't know anyone else in town.

116
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:24,499
I figure we could go for a drive.
Show me the sights, you know?

117
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:28,816
- It won't kill you.
- Promise?

118
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:34,249
- So I take it you're not Canadian?
- Only by marriage.

119
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,976
- Where are you from?
- Chicago.

120
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,574
Not Chicago... Chicago.

121
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:45,535
I was born there but... I don't really know
anything about Chicago any more.

122
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,295
OK.

123
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:51,891
Yeah! Totally oblivious
to anything even related to Chicago.

124
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,890
- I'm from Jersey.
- New Jersey?

125
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,977
Yeah. New Jersey.

126
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:00,415
If you're from Jersey, you're from Jersey.

127
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:04,055
Jersey is another place
I know absolutely nothing about.

128
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,375
- You always this nervous?
- Yes.

129
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:17,170
Like virtually everything else that's wrong
in my life, it all started with the little missis.

130
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:21,293
Back home, her father and I
ran a dental practice together.

131
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,976
- You're a dentist?
- 'Fraid so.

132
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:28,699
- You suicidal?
- See, now, why would you say that?

133
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:31,493
I once read that dentists are prone to suicide.

134
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:35,295
Jimmy, I may hate my life
but I certainly don't wanna die.

135
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:38,293
You better get used to it
because you're going to.

136
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:41,378
I'm gonna kill you! I'm gonna strangle you!

137
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,136
Everybody dies...

138
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:49,536
sooner or later.

139
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,218
- Tulip?
- No!

140
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,893
So you were sayin', your father-in-law...

141
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:58,409
Well, ironically, he was a suicide.

142
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:02,249
- Stats don't lie.
- He got caught molesting a patient.

143
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:05,690
An underage patient.
An underage male patient.

144
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:10,177
- Please, stop!
- I know. So this kid starts to blackmail him.

145
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:14,259
And this is at the exact same time the IRS
decides to investigate him for tax fraud.

146
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:18,658
So big Aaron needs money, and fast,
so he goes to a loan shark,

147
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:23,410
takes out a loan against our company,
which I had no idea about, then proceeds...

148
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,576
To hit Vegas, Atlantic City, Reno.

149
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:29,773
Loses all the money
and sticks you with the bill. Am I right?

150
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:32,573
You are right. That's exactly right.

151
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:37,690
So, after the ensuing scandal
and bankruptcy and embarrassment,

152
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:42,450
my wife and her mother decided
it would be best that we move back here.

153
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,975
You like livin' in Canada?

154
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,455
No, I... I live here with my wife.

155
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,771
You sure you're a dentist?

156
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,892
- Yeah. Why?
- Cos I've never met a dentist I liked.

157
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:01,010
Well, I try to keep things
as painless as possible.

158
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,934
Me too.

159
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,498
Hey.

160
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:20,169
It's been good.
I'm glad we got to know each other.

161
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,849
You know what? Me too.

162
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:28,051
- You can go now.
- Right.

163
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,651
- Oz!
- Yes, dear.

164
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:35,330
- Thank God you're home.
- Thank God I'm home?

165
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:39,009
I had an idea. I figured out a way
we can pay off Daddy's debt.

166
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,569
- You're getting ajob!
- No!

167
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:45,488
- No.
- Our neighbour. There's a price on his head?

168
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,815
That's your plan? Murder our neighbour?

169
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,652
Here's what you're going to do.

170
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:55,808
You're going to Chicago to find out who
it is who's offering this price on his head.

171
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:59,853
- Jimmy Tudeski's head!
- Then you tell them you know where he is...

172
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:04,770
- after you negotiate a finder's fee.
- A finder's fee on a murder contract?

173
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:09,732
- Is there a problem?
- It would make me a party to... a murder.

174
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:15,011
- But he's a killer. You said so yourself.
- That's another good reason not to do it.

175
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:19,179
OK? And whatever he's done, he's been
to prison. He's paid his debt to society.

176
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,256
Well, now he can pay our debt, too.

177
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,814
Look, I know this is gonna sound crazy,

178
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:29,650
but I spent some time with the guy
today and he's... pretty nice, you know?

179
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:32,340
Besides, he hasn't done anything to me.

180
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,330
- He came on to me.
- What?

181
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:38,699
He came on to me!
That animal - he made a pass at me!

182
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:41,175
When?

183
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,860
Earlier. This morning.
Before you came home.

184
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:46,653
He said you guys haven't even met.

185
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:50,056
- Who do you believe? A killer or your wife?
- Do I have to answer that?

186
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:52,011
- Nicholas!
- OK, OK!

187
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:55,337
Let's say... that he did make a pass at you.

188
00:15:55,460 --> 00:16:00,056
He's been in prison for five years. He's
desperate. He'd sleep with a meat grinder.

189
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,740
You pig! You disgust me!

190
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:05,328
There's a known killer living right next door

191
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:08,736
who might slaughter us in our sleep
and you won't lift a finger!

192
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:13,058
That's right. I'm not gonna lift
a finger, because this is crazy.

193
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,056
You do this for me...

194
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,134
and I give you your divorce.

195
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:37,738
And if you don't do this for me, I swear,
I'll make your life so damned miserable

196
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:41,648
it'll make these past few years
seem like a pleasure cruise.

197
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:46,533
I already booked your flight.
You leave tomorrow at 9am.

198
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,776
You better start packing.

199
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:02,492
OK, well, when are you coming back?
I have to reschedule all your appointments.

200
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:05,373
- No more than a couple of days.
- Are you going alone?

201
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,489
Yes.

202
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:11,410
Good. Can you do me a huge favour
while you're there? Go out and get laid!

203
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:15,410
- Jill!
- Call me the second you get back.

204
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:20,056
Better yet, call me right after.
Call me during. I want all the details.

205
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:32,818
All right, now don't expect too much.
I'm not even sure I'll be able to make contact.

206
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:37,138
It's not as if the Gogolaks
have a 1800 number or anything.

207
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,216
I know you'll do what you can.

208
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,856
What is this?

209
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,130
Good luck, my darling.

210
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,216
And hurry home.

211
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,130
Do they have vomit bags on the flight?

212
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,617
You're Jimmy Tudeski, aren't you?
Jimmy the Tulip?

213
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:29,657
Don't worry. Your secret's safe with me, sexy.

214
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:34,219
But... you will never believe
what my darling husband is up to.

215
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:51,339
You're back in Chicago? Great!

216
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:55,248
Tell you what.
Meet me at Ekins Oyster Bar in 45 minutes.

217
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:03,693
- Dave, you got nothin' to worry about.
- How can I not worry?

218
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:07,051
You say you're here to rat
Jimmy Tudeski out to Janni Gogolak...

219
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:10,490
But I'm not going to rat him out.
Do you think I'm suicidal?

220
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:13,214
Well, you are a dentist.

221
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:15,934
Look, I have no intention
of ratting anybody out.

222
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:19,496
The only reason I'm here is
because I want Sophie off my back.

223
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:23,533
I've got a deadline. I'll come by
your hotel room as soon as I'm finished.

224
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:27,448
- Now, promise you won't do anything stupid.
- Why would you even say that?

225
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,536
You married Sophie, didn't you?

226
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,893
I'll get the check, then?

227
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:51,692
- I'm sorry. I must have the wrong...
- What room you lookin' for?

228
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:55,850
- 519.
- You're in the right place.

229
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,936
You Nicholas Oseransky?

230
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:02,180
- Who are you?
- We understand you have information

231
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:05,929
regarding the whereabouts
of Jimmy the Tulip.

232
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:08,176
- Who told you that? Dave?
- Who's Dave?

233
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:11,098
- What... What did he tell you?
- Forget about Dave.

234
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:15,611
For our immediate purposes,
there is no Dave. Dave does not exist.

235
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:20,859
So... just answer my question.
Do you or don't you?

236
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:27,252
Have information regarding
the whereabouts of Jimmy the Tulip?

237
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:31,168
- I don't know what you're talking about, man.
- Really?

238
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:36,295
Then I must have been misinformed.

239
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:39,690
- I apologise.
- It's OK.

240
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:46,739
Now... let's try this again.

241
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:51,817
- We understand you have information...
- Who told you that?

242
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:55,330
Why do you wanna go cluttering your mind
with the inconsequential?

243
00:20:55,460 --> 00:21:00,250
What's important is we know
that you know where Jimmy Tudeski is.

244
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,850
Look, I really have no i...

245
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:07,419
- Aren't you gonna cry out for help?
- Would it do any good?

246
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,814
No.

247
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:11,613
- Who are you?
- Franklin Figueroa.

248
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:15,694
Aka Frankie Figs. I work for Janni Gogolak.

249
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,697
Oh, my God.

250
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:21,095
So... where's Jimmy?

251
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,177
Look, I sw...

252
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:28,292
My brother, believe me.
You don't wanna dance with me all night.

253
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:32,334
And for a scumbag like Jimmy T?
Save yourself the pain.

254
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,816
Look, I really have no idea...

255
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,930
I may know where he is.

256
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:43,972
Well, all right. But don't tell me.
Let's go tell Janni.

257
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,979
OK. Do you mind if I piss a little blood first?

258
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,056
- Please, by all means.
- Thanks.

259
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:23,136
My father...

260
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:26,096
is a great man.

261
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,656
A man of "wision" and...

262
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,929
character.

263
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:39,014
A man who stood up for his beliefs.

264
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:45,131
Unlike that rat fuck

265
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:49,414
piece of shit... Tudeski.

266
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:55,136
Can you...

267
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:00,500
ask Cynthia to join us, please?

268
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,696
- You want a drink?
- Oh, no, thanks.

269
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:10,932
- Have a drink.
- I'll have a Scotch and soda, please.

270
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,056
I want you to understand.

271
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:19,372
Frankie explained to me you're having
a problem with your conscience.

272
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:24,335
- Yes, it's just that none of this was my idea.
- Do you think it was mine? No.

273
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,375
If I had my way, my father...

274
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:31,973
would still be running things
and I'd be somewhere like...

275
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,730
I dunno.

276
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,652
Aruba.

277
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:45,215
Actually, Aruba's not that nice.

278
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:49,329
- Excuse me?
- You may like it.

279
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:53,859
See, I honeymooned there
and that's probably why I didn't like it.

280
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:58,852
The thing you gotta remember is,
when we're talkin' about Jimmy Tudeski,

281
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:01,813
we're not talkin' about a human being.

282
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,932
We're talkin' about a rodent.

283
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,416
We're talking about...

284
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,816
"wermin".

285
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:21,694
- Where was I?
- "Wermin". I think "wermin".

286
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:25,730
We're talkin' about someone... Screw that!

287
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:28,328
Some thing

288
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:31,213
that doesn't deserve to be breathing...

289
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,936
the air.

290
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:36,415
Janni, talkin' about yourself again?

291
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:40,375
Mr Oseransky,

292
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,536
this is Cynthia.

293
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,055
Jimmy's wife.

294
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:01,059
- Cynthia, it seems that Mr...
- Doctor.

295
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:06,495
- Excuse me?
- Dr Oseransky. He's a dentist.

296
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:08,448
Whatever.

297
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:13,017
It seems that our dentist friend here
knows where Jimmy is.

298
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:17,089
- Oh? Come to collect on the contract?
- No.

299
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:21,338
Janni, just so you know, since I'm
the one that found this guy... I want it.

300
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:24,020
- The contract's mine.
- As long as I'm in on the kill.

301
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:29,578
- So long as I get full price.
- I wanna see that spineless rat beg.

302
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:35,339
- Money doesn't matter.
- Well, now I've heard everything!

303
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:39,898
Don't you believe it.
This one? Kill you for a quarter.

304
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,416
Mr Oseransky.

305
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:47,298
Frankie will accompany you back to Canada.

306
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:50,969
You will lead him to the man
you believe is Jimmy Tudeski.

307
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,739
- But, sir...
- Frankie, you'll let me know?

308
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,896
All right, then.

309
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,936
Mr... Mr Gogolak?

310
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:04,494
My wife would make my life
even more miserable than it already is

311
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:06,929
if I didn't at least ask.

312
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:14,009
Is there gonna be any kind
of finder's fee for this?

313
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:20,731
Finder's fee?

314
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:41,491
I tell you what.
Tell your wife we'll work somethin' out.

315
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:53,891
Cynthia, don't rush off.
We should chat a little.

316
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:04,130
I'll call you in the morning.
We'll leave first thing.

317
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:11,656
Doctor. You're not gonna do anything stupid
like try leaving me in the lurch, are you?

318
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:13,293
No.

319
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:18,253
- Who did you talk to?
- What are you talking about?

320
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:20,531
- You know Frankie Figs?
- I know of him.

321
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:23,970
Yeah, well, when I came back from lunch,
he was sitting in my room!

322
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:27,536
- Frankie Figs was in your room?!
- And he knew all about my knowing

323
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:29,810
- where Jimmy the Tulip is!
- What did he do?

324
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:34,252
After he played congas on my kidneys,
he took me to see Janni Gogolak.

325
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:38,055
- Oz, tell me you're kidding me.
- Who did you tell? I wanna know who!

326
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:40,535
- No one. I swear.
- Well, then, how...

327
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:47,577
What am I gonna do?
I'll talk to you later. I gotta go.

328
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:10,417
- Room service.
- This is Dr Oseransky in room 519.

329
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:13,657
I'm gonna need a bigger bottle of Scotch.

330
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,215
- Yeah?
- It's me.

331
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,615
Oz! How ya doin'?

332
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,935
What do I do? I've done something terrible!

333
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:35,689
- What could be so terrible?
- You've gotta get out of town, out of Canada.

334
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:40,052
- Just get the hell out. I'm in Chicago.
- Yeah. I heard about that.

335
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:43,175
Have you seen Janni yet?

336
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:47,579
- How did you know that?
- Relax.

337
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:51,254
I know about the whole thing.
OK? Don't worry.

338
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:54,896
- But...
- I'll explain everything when you get back.

339
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:59,571
In the meantime, why don't you have a good
time while you're down there? Live it up.

340
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:02,736
We'll talk when you get back.

341
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:04,293
If you say so, Jim.

342
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:43,695
Are you gonna invite me in or do I go down
and tell Janni's guys you're being impolite?

343
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:45,856
Janni's guys are downstairs?

344
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:48,176
Yes. Come in.

345
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,656
I love a man with manners.

346
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:05,979
Janni sent me to see if you were on the level.
Janni's the trusting type.

347
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:10,615
- So, do you or don't you?
- Do I or don't I...

348
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:14,453
Know where my wayward husband is?

349
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:18,450
- Mrs Tudeski...
- Cynthia. The woman you're about to widow.

350
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:20,969
- You don't understand.
- What's not to understand?

351
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:23,136
You want your 30 pieces of silver, right?

352
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:26,218
My only question is
why didn't you just do the job yourself?

353
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:30,333
- Why didn't I...
- Kill Jimmy and collect on the contract?

354
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:33,532
What's the matter?
You didn't have the stomach for it?

355
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:36,852
Or is your problem a little further... south?

356
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:42,617
- Have you vomited recently?
- Yes. I was gonna brush my teeth.

357
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,378
- I'll wait.
- OK.

358
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:49,448
Mrs Tudeski...
Cynthia, none of this was my idea.

359
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:52,538
You just happened
to travel 1,000 miles to rat Jimmy out.

360
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:56,448
That's what I'm trying to say.
It wasn't my idea. It was my wife's plan.

361
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:59,572
She wanted me to come to Chicago
and rat Jimmy out.

362
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:04,214
Maybe it would be best if you just went
back to Janni and said that I'm crazy.

363
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:08,731
That I've gone nuts. I'm chemically
imbalanced, you know. I'm wacko.

364
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,810
Maybe that would be the best thing.

365
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,896
Because...

366
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:23,777
Tell him I'm acting
exactly the way I'm acting right now.

367
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:26,812
But you do know where Jimmy is, don't you?

368
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:31,497
Look, Mrs Tudeski,
I don't want anybody to die.

369
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:35,129
And that is on the level.

370
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:41,209
- What do you want?
- What do I want?

371
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:47,535
I just want this all to end.

372
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:57,495
I am so damned scared.

373
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:04,769
That's room service.
Before I vomited, I ordered Scotch.

374
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:09,410
There you go. Thank you.

375
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:16,055
What would you say to a drink?

376
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:20,179
I'd say no ice, no water, in a tall glass.

377
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:25,696
What can I say? I was young.
Jimmy was like no man I'd ever met before.

378
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:29,013
Yeah, well, he's the first killer I've known.

379
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:31,734
There was no one like him
at my daddy's country club.

380
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:34,658
Lousy husband, though.
Cheated on me constantly.

381
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:37,334
- So why don't you just...
- Divorce him?

382
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:41,855
Jimmy doesn't believe in divorce.
Thinks it's a sin.

383
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:46,448
I know. A hit man with morals. Go figure!

384
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:50,209
So now that he's out of prison...
are you guys gonna get back together?

385
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:53,776
You mean assuming Frankie
and Janni don't kill him first?

386
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:56,133
No.

387
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:58,216
Jimmy and I are over.

388
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:01,332
Even if I wanted to make
another go of it, which I don't,

389
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:04,372
there'd always be
that other thing between us.

390
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,456
What other thing?

391
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:10,738
- The fact that he wants to kill me.
- Why?

392
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:14,810
You're a sweet guy. Money.

393
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:17,569
Oh! Are you... Are you rich?

394
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:20,976
The money Lazlo Gogolak
gave us as a wedding present.

395
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:26,220
Only it wasn't a present. Lazlo was parking
the money with us to hide it from the feds.

396
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:29,093
- How much was it?
- Ten million dollars.

397
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:33,338
- Helluva parking space.
- The only way to get the money

398
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:37,658
was if Jimmy and Janni and I
all signed for it together.

399
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:41,614
If you didn't have all three signatures,
you'd need two signatures...

400
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:43,696
and a death certificate.

401
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:47,337
- Or one signature and...
- Two death certificates.

402
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:50,816
- So if Jimmy kills you...
- And Janni. Let's not forget about Janni.

403
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:54,569
- Then he gets the money. All of it.
- The whole nine yards.

404
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:01,337
What if you just told him
you didn't want the money?

405
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:05,574
I did tell him. I don't want a dime.

406
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:09,211
But he knows I don't wanna be
married to him and he won't divorce.

407
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:12,093
- But murder, he's OK with?
- It's what he does.

408
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:15,813
If it was me, ten million wouldn't be enough.

409
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:19,489
So how much would it take
for you to kill your wife?

410
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:21,929
- I'm talking about you.
- Me, then. How much?

411
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:26,451
That's what I'm saying. I think you are
the most beautiful thing I have ever seen.

412
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:30,971
- I cannot believe I am saying this out loud.
- I'm sure that's just the Scotch talking.

413
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:33,056
No, it's me.

414
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:39,978
I've spent the last seven years just
sitting and waiting for something to happen.

415
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:42,534
I didn't even know what it was...

416
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:47,535
until you walked in that room
at Janni Gogolak's house.

417
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:52,813
- I'm sorry. I've embarrassed you.
- I should go.

418
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,896
- No.
- Please.

419
00:34:57,060 --> 00:35:00,177
You're a nice guy... but I've gotta go.

420
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,056
Let's go.

421
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:18,058
You know the night's still young.
You boys in any rush to get back?

422
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:25,458
Did you mean what you said?

423
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,815
I've got till midnight.

424
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:32,896
In the meantime...

425
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:45,176
- Promise me something.
- Anything.

426
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,939
You'll go slow.
I haven't made love in five years.

427
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:50,654
Neither have I.

428
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:53,135
I've been married.

429
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:07,976
It's almost time.

430
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:13,054
Again? What did you have,
oysters for lunch?

431
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:15,136
Actually, I did.

432
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:21,936
Jimmy knows I'm here.

433
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:25,655
- Here with me?
- Here in Chicago, talking with Janni.

434
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:31,371
- How? How did he know that?
- Because I told him.

435
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,536
- You what?
- He already knew.

436
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:36,090
- How?
- I'm guessing my darling wife.

437
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:40,008
- Is she trying to get you killed?
- Apparently! That's all I can come up with.

438
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:44,975
But when I talked to Jimmy...
he didn't sound upset.

439
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:49,332
No, he wouldn't. He'd be your best friend
right up until the moment he...

440
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:53,893
He's gonna kill me, isn't he?

441
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:56,932
Then, when he's done with that,
he's gonna come after you.

442
00:36:57,060 --> 00:37:00,052
I'm not gonna let that happen.
I'm not gonna let Jimmy kill you.

443
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:02,740
I'm gonna take Frankie to Canada
and lead him to Jimmy.

444
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:06,899
- So Frankie can kill him.
- I don't like it, but better Jimmy than you.

445
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:09,818
Oz, don't you get it? Either way, I'm dead.

446
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:12,776
- Why? W-Why?
- When Jimmy's dead,

447
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:15,255
why would Janni wanna keep me alive?

448
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:20,056
- He'd wanna kill me too...
- So he can collect on the ten million dollars.

449
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:25,010
Well, I'm not gonna let that happen.

450
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:27,813
I swear I am not gonna let anybody kill you.

451
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:33,654
Under the circumstances, that's
the most romantic thing I've ever heard.

452
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,736
Thanks.

453
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:01,012
You what? You told Jimmy?

454
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:03,096
What the hell did you do that for?

455
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:06,132
I felt bad. I like him. I liked him.

456
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:09,809
- So you don't like him no more?
- It's sort of hard if he wants to kill you.

457
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:13,933
If you sold my ass out to Janni then told
me about it, I'd wanna ice your ass too.

458
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:16,016
I know.

459
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,770
- I can close that gap for you.
- Really?

460
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:22,972
- Yeah, you'd be in and out.
- You're kiddin'? This thing here?

461
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:25,939
So, did you do it?
Did you do what I told you to do?

462
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:29,337
- No, no. I'm not gonna answer that!
- So you did?!

463
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:32,498
- I can tell. You had sex!
- Full-size car, please!

464
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:35,259
- Who is she? I wanna hear all about it!
- I gotta go.

465
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:39,168
- Any emergencies, I've got my beeper on.
- OK, fine. Be that way.

466
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:43,179
The hell bitch called. She and her mom
went to Niagara Falls for a couple of days.

467
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:45,939
Probably workin' on her alibi. I gotta go.

468
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:49,569
Why don't you drive back
to the hotel with me?

469
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:55,332
Unless, of course, you'd rather go home in
broad daylight with Jimmy right next door?

470
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:57,416
Yeah, I'll go with you.

471
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,934
Frankie Figs.

472
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:35,456
Jimmy T.

473
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:49,260
What's goin' on, man? What's up, baby?

474
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:51,935
So, Frankie! Welcome to Montreal.

475
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:54,779
- What's up, partner?
- You're looking good!

476
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:59,895
- Oz, you look worried. Doesn't he, Frankie?
- He does, man.

477
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:04,889
Why don't you relax? Come on! Frankie
told me what a stand-up guy you've been.

478
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:09,413
Now change your pants. We're goin' out.

479
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:14,011
C'est une chanson

480
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:17,410
Qui nous ressemble

481
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:22,496
Toi, qui m'aimais

482
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:26,815
Moi, qui t'aimais

483
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:29,936
Et nous vivions

484
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:33,535
Tous les deux ensemble...

485
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:38,734
I'm gonna keep the coke and the fries,
but I'm gonna send this burger back.

486
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:43,898
If you put any mayonnaise on it, I'm gonna
come over your house, chop your legs off,

487
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:48,855
set your house on fire, and watch as you drag
your bloody stumps outta your house. OK?

488
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,538
Pierre?

489
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:52,252
I'm fine.

490
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:54,496
You're fine?

491
00:40:55,340 --> 00:41:00,460
Let me tell you somethin', Oz. You are not
fine. You know your wife wants you dead?

492
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:02,775
That much I've figured out.

493
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:05,937
I thought you should know.
I'm not the first one she came to.

494
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:07,379
- The first...
- Hitter.

495
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,297
- There were others?
- At least one.

496
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:12,412
Apparently, that fell through
so she came to me.

497
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:16,455
What did you tell her?

498
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:23,700
You mean did I... take the contract?

499
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,855
No. I didn't take the contract.

500
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:36,175
- How much did she offer you?
- Ten grand.

501
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:41,974
No wonder you turned her down!

502
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:45,177
But you did turn her down?
Even though I went to Janni?

503
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:49,088
You didn't go to Janni.
Jimmy sent me to come to you.

504
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:52,735
I know that Frankie can be very persuasive.

505
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:55,852
- By the way, how's your urination?
- Fine, thank you.

506
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:57,971
So why did you want me to go see Janni?

507
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:02,053
- So you could tell him where I was.
- So he'd come here and you could kill him?

508
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:06,293
Exacto! By the way...
I'd be happy to do your wife for you.

509
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:07,853
- Do my wife?
- Tap her.

510
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:09,095
- Whack her.
- Whack her?

511
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:11,495
Oh! Oh, see, I thought you meant...

512
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:16,456
Cos she told me that you...
you know, hit on her.

513
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:20,735
That's funny.

514
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:22,896
Why is that funny?

515
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:31,053
Actually, I wasn't gonna tell you this,
but... the truth is, your wife came on to me.

516
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:35,494
- And?
- Oz... we're friends.

517
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:39,454
Friends do not engage in sexual congress
with each other's wives.

518
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:46,331
Besides... I don't find your wife
particularly that attractive.

519
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:48,291
You just got out of prison.

520
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:52,459
You've been in prison for five years
and you don't find my wife attractive?

521
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:54,935
She's not a good person.

522
00:42:56,900 --> 00:43:01,291
You've killed 17 people... and you
don't think my wife is a good person?

523
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:06,090
It's not important
how many people I've killed.

524
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:11,856
What's important... is how I get along
with the people that are still alive.

525
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:20,740
- You gonna finish this?
- Just take it.

526
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:27,129
Les pas des amants

527
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:35,049
Désunis

528
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:47,736
I think we've given it long enough.

529
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:50,897
Give Janni a call.
The sooner he gets here, the better.

530
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:53,818
After you kill Janni,
are you gonna go back to Chicago?

531
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:55,817
No. I've done with Chicago.

532
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:59,933
What about your wife?
Are you gonna get back together with her?

533
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:06,172
- You're gonna kill her too?
- For a helluva lot more than 10,000 dollars!

534
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:08,495
- Well, you can't do that!
- Why not?

535
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:10,576
Because she's your wife!

536
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:13,851
Jimmy, you were right about him.
He's an exceedingly sweet man.

537
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:16,653
Wife like he got
and still he believes in weddin' vows!

538
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:19,738
So do I. Especially "Till death do us part."

539
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:23,018
It's my beeper. I gotta go to the office.

540
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:25,495
Well, wedding vows or not...

541
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:28,492
I'd watch my back.

542
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:31,453
I'd say your wife's still shoppin' for a hitter.

543
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:33,536
Good luck.

544
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:03,576
You know what? On second thought,
I think we're gonna have to pull the tooth.

545
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:19,060
Oz! What is it? What's the matter?

546
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:24,016
Oh, no! Oz, no! I'll take that!

547
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:26,096
Oz!

548
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:31,616
- I am your friend. Talk to me.
- I have to talk to somebody

549
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:34,573
- because I'm gonna do something...
- Take your time.

550
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:42,011
That's good.

551
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:46,019
First of all, I just found out
that my wife is trying to have me killed.

552
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:48,096
- Who told you?
- A friend.

553
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:50,654
- Anyone I know?
- He's my next-door neighbour.

554
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:53,453
And here's the funny part. He's a hit man too!

555
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:57,414
- Really? What's his name?
- Jimmy. Jimmy Tudeski.

556
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:00,451
Jimmy the Tulip?

557
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:03,652
Jimmy the Tulip lives next to you?
And you know him?!

558
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:06,135
Oz, can you introduce me to him?

559
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:09,491
Jill... The man's a professional killer.

560
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:14,011
Oz, I've been wanting to meet this guy
for years. Please, Oz. Come on!

561
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:18,330
Oh, Oz!

562
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:20,212
Quick, come on!

563
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:26,931
- What's this, Oz?
- I dunno.

564
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:32,453
It is you. Mr Tudeski, you don't understand.
I'm one of your biggest fans.

565
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:37,938
I've followed your career since I was a kid.
That's why I'm trying to get into the business.

566
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:42,249
- What business would that be?
- Contract killing. It's what I wanna do.

567
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:47,249
If I could just have one afternoon of your
time, I know I could learn so much from you.

568
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:51,736
So come in.

569
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:56,736
You too.

570
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:05,855
What's all this?

571
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:08,210
- How do you know her?
- She's my assistant.

572
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:11,138
- Did you know she was a hitter?
- I'm still a virgin.

573
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:13,774
I haven't killed anyone yet, professionally.

574
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:15,856
- Oz was gonna be my first.
- Excuse me?

575
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:17,732
- His wife hired me.
- That was you?

576
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:22,251
It was supposed to look like an accident, so
I went to work for him to identify his habits.

577
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:24,336
- Good. Smart.
- Thanks.

578
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:28,499
But then after I got to know him,
I... started to like him.

579
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:30,451
- First mistake.
- I know!

580
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:33,333
You should get close, but not too close.

581
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:39,419
- Oz, why don't you pour yourself a martini?
- It's four o'clock in the afternoon.

582
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:41,856
I'll...

583
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:47,493
Don't give yourself a hard time.
You've got your whole career ahead.

584
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:51,010
I remember when I was first startin' out,
I hadn't done that much.

585
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:55,577
I'd done some things, saw some money, was
having fun. I was doing somethin' I liked.

586
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:59,136
And I was recruited by Lazlo Gogolak.

587
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:02,252
He wanted me to whack out
one of his little cousins.

588
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:06,214
- Is this the Stanley Posilansky incident?
- Yeah.

589
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:09,571
Anyway, Lazlo doesn't want it
to look like a hit.

590
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:15,730
So I've gotta get close to Stanley, who was
this really charming, cute, funny little guy.

591
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:18,613
Very weird sense of humour. Made me laugh.

592
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:22,773
I really liked him as a person.
You know what I mean?

593
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,856
You got too close.

594
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:33,456
Yeah. I got too close.

595
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:38,175
Moment of truth comes... I choked.

596
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:40,650
- Him?
- Me. I choked.

597
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:43,056
I couldn't do it. I actually...

598
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:47,016
I told him I was there to kill him.

599
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:51,258
I said "Run, Stanley, run!
Go, go! Run, hide. Off you go."

600
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:53,974
We shake hands, part as friends.

601
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:59,330
I turn around to walk away...
and that weasel shoots me in the back.

602
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:01,974
The bullet comes out right here.

603
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:07,970
- So what did you do?
- I didn't really like Stanley after that.

604
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:11,817
He took a really... really long time to die.

605
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:17,296
And this scar's a reminder.
Never get too close.

606
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:31,089
Excuse me!

607
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:36,056
Excuse me!

608
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:40,971
Not to interrupt or anything, but you
were gonna kill me? That was the plan?

609
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:46,933
- What are you doin' tonight?
- No plans.

610
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:49,974
Wanna help us out? Me and Frankie Figs.

611
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:54,738
Wait. Are you offering me ajob?

612
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:57,171
Only if you're interested.

613
00:49:57,780 --> 00:50:01,329
It would be an honour.
It would be like a dream come true!

614
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:05,615
- Who's the mark?
- Janni Gogo.

615
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:09,054
Janni Gogo?

616
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:14,092
Feel my arm. Goose bumps!

617
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:16,176
Phone!

618
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:18,971
The phone scared me.

619
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:21,056
There it is again!

620
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:23,857
- What is wrong with you?
- I dunno.

621
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:25,936
Yeah. Frankie.

622
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:33,056
OK, good. See you soon.

623
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:35,656
- Good news?
- Great news.

624
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:40,815
Apparently Janni Gogo is on his way
up here and... bringing my wife with him.

625
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:43,579
- Your wife?
- Your... He's got... Why?

626
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:46,658
Janni figures he'll take care of her
when he takes care of me.

627
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:51,217
- So what are you gonna do? Try to save her?
- No. I want her dead, too.

628
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:54,088
- Really?
- Yeah. You got a problem with it?

629
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:57,496
- Why would I? It's not like I know her.
- I can't believe you people!

630
00:50:57,620 --> 00:51:01,818
Here you are, calmly talking about
the murder of a beautiful, innocent woman,

631
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:04,659
whose only crime
is that she married you, Jimmy,

632
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:07,772
so I'm not gonna listen to this any more.

633
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:10,289
You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna...

634
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:13,092
I'm gonna...

635
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:15,176
I'm gonna go!

636
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:18,818
All right!

637
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:20,896
Does this slide? What?

638
00:51:54,409 --> 00:51:56,365
Answer that.

639
00:52:00,329 --> 00:52:02,604
That's my phone, thank you.

640
00:52:05,449 --> 00:52:07,405
Hello?

641
00:52:09,049 --> 00:52:11,005
- Well, who was it?
- They hung up.

642
00:52:11,129 --> 00:52:15,327
- Expecting a call?
- Explain how that's any of your business.

643
00:52:15,449 --> 00:52:19,044
Get her bag. The plane's waiting and I'm not.

644
00:52:55,969 --> 00:52:58,244
Oh, my God.

645
00:53:04,929 --> 00:53:08,558
- You don't like the Walther?
- Go with what you're comfortable with.

646
00:53:08,689 --> 00:53:10,520
- It's what James Bond uses.
- Really?

647
00:53:10,649 --> 00:53:12,526
- Yeah.
- Still, I'd like...

648
00:53:27,329 --> 00:53:30,002
Is there any way
I can stop you from doing this?

649
00:53:30,129 --> 00:53:34,407
Oz, will you relax? I promise you, no one
will know you had anything to do with this.

650
00:53:34,529 --> 00:53:36,599
- That's not the point.
- What is the point?

651
00:53:36,729 --> 00:53:38,799
You're still gonna kill your wife!

652
00:53:39,249 --> 00:53:41,205
Well...

653
00:53:42,489 --> 00:53:43,717
yeah!

654
00:53:44,649 --> 00:53:47,402
I've got a very good reason to kill my wife.

655
00:53:49,009 --> 00:53:51,921
I've got ten million
very good reasons to kill my wife.

656
00:53:52,049 --> 00:53:54,165
OK, well... what if I said no?

657
00:53:55,169 --> 00:53:58,684
You know, what if I said
I wasn't gonna let you do it?

658
00:54:03,129 --> 00:54:06,121
You are the most chivalrous guy
I have ever met in my life.

659
00:54:06,249 --> 00:54:09,525
- Do you see why I couldn't kill him?
- I love him.

660
00:54:09,649 --> 00:54:11,605
Oz... come on.

661
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:17,164
You relax. Come on over here, sit down in
your favourite chair. Have another martini.

662
00:54:18,849 --> 00:54:22,888
Listen to me. Tonight is gonna happen,
whether you want it to or not.

663
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:25,648
- And... you're gonna help.
- Me? Help?

664
00:54:25,769 --> 00:54:30,285
Yeah. You, help. You're gonna help.
You're gonna go with Frankie to meet Janni.

665
00:54:30,409 --> 00:54:32,764
If you're not there, Janni will get suspicious,

666
00:54:32,889 --> 00:54:36,199
get back on the plane and fly back
to Chicago, and we don't want that.

667
00:54:36,329 --> 00:54:38,365
- Jimmy.
- Oz.

668
00:54:38,489 --> 00:54:40,798
This is the way it's gotta be, OK?

669
00:54:40,929 --> 00:54:42,885
And...

670
00:54:43,369 --> 00:54:47,681
I'm tellin' you this like a friend
because... if you screw this up,

671
00:54:48,609 --> 00:54:50,839
I would hate to...

672
00:54:53,009 --> 00:54:55,364
I would really hate to have to kill you.

673
00:54:55,929 --> 00:54:58,887
I would hate it.
I'd hate it more than mayonnaise.

674
00:54:59,009 --> 00:55:01,398
- You know how much I hate mayonnaise.
- Yes, I do.

675
00:55:01,529 --> 00:55:03,963
And trust me, you want Janni Gogolak dead.

676
00:55:04,089 --> 00:55:07,047
That's where you're wrong.
I don't want anybody dead.

677
00:55:07,169 --> 00:55:10,639
Well, if we don't make Janni Gogolak dead,
he's gonna make you dead.

678
00:55:10,769 --> 00:55:14,557
- The Gogolaks don't leave witnesses around.
- Oh, so now...

679
00:55:14,689 --> 00:55:18,887
Damn it, Jimmy! Why the hell did
you have to go and move in next door to me?

680
00:55:19,009 --> 00:55:23,161
Oz, do you know what kind of soil
they have in this back yard?

681
00:55:23,289 --> 00:55:26,725
- After two days, I've got little tomato plants...
- Oh, my God!

682
00:55:29,849 --> 00:55:32,158
Yes! Yes! Yes!

683
00:55:32,289 --> 00:55:34,803
Yes... Yes! Yes!

684
00:55:36,609 --> 00:55:38,918
- Why did you stop?
- Are you doing it tonight?

685
00:55:39,049 --> 00:55:42,439
- Tonight, whenever. Kick it into gear!
- For 10,000?

686
00:55:42,769 --> 00:55:45,647
Wait a minute.
You said we were doin' this for 15.

687
00:55:45,769 --> 00:55:49,842
I changed my mind. But if you think
I should try to find somebody else, I can...

688
00:55:49,969 --> 00:55:52,324
No, no, no, no.

689
00:55:52,449 --> 00:55:55,759
Listen, why don't we make it... 12,500?

690
00:55:56,649 --> 00:55:59,686
I can live with 12,500.
As long as my husband doesn't.

691
00:55:59,849 --> 00:56:02,283
He won't. I promise.

692
00:56:04,129 --> 00:56:06,120
- You must be...
- Jill St Clair.

693
00:56:06,249 --> 00:56:10,686
And can I just say, Mr Figueroa,
that I think the job you did on Kevin Vincent,

694
00:56:10,809 --> 00:56:15,837
that and the Ronald Abramson hit,
they were both just... They were works of art.

695
00:56:15,969 --> 00:56:19,484
- I see you've done your homework.
- Well, I keep a scrapbook.

696
00:56:19,609 --> 00:56:21,679
- Frankie!
- What's up, man?

697
00:56:21,809 --> 00:56:25,040
Honey, why don't you go get Oz?
I wanna run through this again,

698
00:56:25,169 --> 00:56:27,160
make sure we know what we're doing.

699
00:56:30,089 --> 00:56:32,239
- Cute kid.
- Got definite potential.

700
00:56:41,489 --> 00:56:44,447
Time to rock and roll.

701
00:57:42,249 --> 00:57:43,887
I got this same car.

702
00:57:44,009 --> 00:57:45,965
- Really?
- No.

703
00:58:09,369 --> 00:58:11,325
All right, nobody move.

704
00:58:14,489 --> 00:58:16,320
Everybody quiet.

705
00:58:38,969 --> 00:58:41,358
God, I'm gonna love this.

706
00:58:41,489 --> 00:58:44,003
So... now what?

707
00:58:44,129 --> 00:58:46,359
Now we wait until...

708
00:58:49,689 --> 00:58:52,487
- he's asleep.
- OK.

709
00:59:20,529 --> 00:59:23,327
Sweet dreams, Jimmy.

710
00:59:23,449 --> 00:59:25,405
Let's get started.

711
00:59:46,889 --> 00:59:48,845
We got company.

712
00:59:54,729 --> 00:59:58,005
- Anybody we know?
- Oz's wife and some guy.

713
00:59:58,529 --> 01:00:01,646
Probably your replacement. The new hitter.

714
01:00:02,569 --> 01:00:05,322
Well, nothing we can do about it now.

715
01:00:05,449 --> 01:00:07,679
- Keep an eye on 'em.
- OK.

716
01:00:07,809 --> 01:00:09,800
Love those pants on you.

717
01:00:10,449 --> 01:00:14,408
- So what is he, a bad guy, your husband?
- No.

718
01:00:14,529 --> 01:00:17,248
Actually, everyone seems to like him.

719
01:00:18,009 --> 01:00:21,126
Which might be the thing
I hate most about him.

720
01:00:21,249 --> 01:00:24,321
- So let's go over this one more time.
- What the hell for?

721
01:00:24,449 --> 01:00:27,009
I just wanna make sure
we got everything right.

722
01:00:27,129 --> 01:00:29,518
Is there any particular way
you want him to die?

723
01:00:29,649 --> 01:00:34,245
What do I care? I'm out of the country.
Shopping for my funeral dress.

724
01:00:36,889 --> 01:00:39,449
Dentist... get the blinds.

725
01:00:43,529 --> 01:00:45,485
Today!

726
01:01:03,929 --> 01:01:06,238
Oh, God! Of all the times...

727
01:01:08,449 --> 01:01:12,362
You're married, right?
Does your wife have any...

728
01:01:12,809 --> 01:01:15,642
Feminine products! Yes. Yes, she does.

729
01:01:15,769 --> 01:01:19,398
They're right through there.
I'll show you where they are.

730
01:01:21,049 --> 01:01:23,563
- Don't b' long.
- Don't blong?

731
01:01:23,689 --> 01:01:25,645
- Don't be long.
- Gotcha.

732
01:01:27,209 --> 01:01:30,804
You make a little noise, he gets out
of bed to see what the problem is

733
01:01:31,049 --> 01:01:33,085
and you make him dead! OK?

734
01:01:33,209 --> 01:01:35,279
- You understand me?
- The dead part?

735
01:01:35,409 --> 01:01:38,242
Ransack the house a bit
so it looks like a bad burglary.

736
01:01:38,369 --> 01:01:43,489
And you get your ass back in this car,
and we drive like hell back to Niagara Falls.

737
01:01:43,689 --> 01:01:46,203
Where you're gonna pay me
my other 5,000 dollars?

738
01:01:46,449 --> 01:01:48,963
My mother's there waiting with it.

739
01:01:49,089 --> 01:01:51,205
Your mother, she knows about this?

740
01:01:51,369 --> 01:01:54,008
My mother wants this to happen
as much as I do.

741
01:01:54,809 --> 01:01:57,403
And I really, really want this to happen.

742
01:01:59,969 --> 01:02:02,358
- They're gonna kill you!
- What?

743
01:02:02,489 --> 01:02:06,482
When they're done with Jimmy, Janni's
gonna come after you. I came to warn you.

744
01:02:06,609 --> 01:02:08,361
Oh, that is...

745
01:02:10,969 --> 01:02:13,563
Janni won't kill anyone.
Jimmy's waiting for them.

746
01:02:13,689 --> 01:02:16,078
- So Jimmy...
- Jimmy and Frankie, they're in...

747
01:02:16,209 --> 01:02:17,244
- Cahoots.
- Right.

748
01:02:17,369 --> 01:02:20,486
- And you? Are you cahooting with them?
- I had to pretend I was.

749
01:02:20,609 --> 01:02:22,964
But, listen... I have a plan.

750
01:02:26,289 --> 01:02:28,928
It's time. You two stay here.

751
01:02:38,569 --> 01:02:40,924
Hey. You know these guys?

752
01:02:43,089 --> 01:02:44,522
No.

753
01:02:44,729 --> 01:02:46,685
Who is that?

754
01:02:50,449 --> 01:02:53,088
- Is that Janni Gogolak?
- From the Gogolak gang.

755
01:02:53,209 --> 01:02:56,406
It might be. The guy they call
Jimmy the Tulip lives next door.

756
01:02:57,449 --> 01:03:01,078
Jimmy the Tulip. Damn!
This is a hit. Stay right here.

757
01:03:13,049 --> 01:03:15,404
- Who's that?
- I don't know.

758
01:03:16,769 --> 01:03:19,283
You smell great!

759
01:03:21,049 --> 01:03:23,165
Shoot!

760
01:03:23,289 --> 01:03:28,158
- You got a gun now. Gonna use it or not?
- Kill him, Major.

761
01:03:28,289 --> 01:03:32,840
Yeah, kill him, Major. Go ahead!
Show him how you're not afraid to die!

762
01:03:32,969 --> 01:03:34,925
Shoot!

763
01:03:42,449 --> 01:03:44,804
Looks like you don't want it enough.

764
01:03:48,649 --> 01:03:51,447
You should laugh when
something's funny for a change.

765
01:03:51,569 --> 01:03:55,164
One rock or more or less isn't worth dying for.

766
01:04:04,929 --> 01:04:07,523
Hi. Are you guys looking for someone?

767
01:04:18,129 --> 01:04:19,562
Hi, Janni.

768
01:04:19,809 --> 01:04:21,765
Watch your head!

769
01:04:35,809 --> 01:04:40,405
You know, this whole sneakin'-into-the-house
thing to try to kill me?

770
01:04:41,129 --> 01:04:43,563
You guys are really good! You really...

771
01:04:44,529 --> 01:04:46,759
Goodbye, Janni.

772
01:05:10,929 --> 01:05:13,318
- What's goin' on?
- Oz took off with your wife.

773
01:05:13,449 --> 01:05:17,965
- And Sophie's hitter's right outside.
- All right. I'll take care of it.

774
01:05:18,089 --> 01:05:19,602
You should get dressed.

775
01:05:19,729 --> 01:05:22,562
You know what? Better yet, stay just like that.

776
01:05:22,689 --> 01:05:25,408
In 60 seconds,
stick your head out that window.

777
01:05:27,609 --> 01:05:29,565
Hey.

778
01:05:30,009 --> 01:05:33,046
- Nice work.
- Thanks, Jimmy.

779
01:05:35,089 --> 01:05:37,319
Be right back.

780
01:05:37,449 --> 01:05:41,965
You know, I can't think of nothin' finer
than a fine naked woman holdin' a gun.

781
01:05:42,089 --> 01:05:45,001
And you just all kinds of fine, ain't you?

782
01:05:45,129 --> 01:05:47,085
Don't get any ideas.

783
01:05:48,769 --> 01:05:50,885
A seriously sweet ass.

784
01:05:58,289 --> 01:06:00,245
Can I help you?

785
01:06:14,649 --> 01:06:17,038
Now you can get dressed.

786
01:06:32,009 --> 01:06:34,967
- Where do you want this?
- Just put it over there.

787
01:06:42,209 --> 01:06:44,769
What was Oz doin'
goin' off with my wife like that?

788
01:06:44,889 --> 01:06:47,926
- I can beep him. You can ask him.
- Beep him.

789
01:06:48,689 --> 01:06:50,441
Now ain't this some shit?

790
01:06:53,969 --> 01:06:58,087
All right, maybe he won't come after us.
Maybe he'll just let us go.

791
01:06:58,209 --> 01:07:01,997
OK. Maybe I can talk to him.
Reason with him. We're friends now, right?

792
01:07:02,129 --> 01:07:06,008
- That's what Harry Lefkowitz thought.
- What happened to him?

793
01:07:07,609 --> 01:07:09,918
I don't wanna know what happened to him.

794
01:07:12,409 --> 01:07:14,559
It's your beeper.

795
01:07:14,689 --> 01:07:16,645
I know.

796
01:07:17,849 --> 01:07:19,805
It's Jimmy.

797
01:07:21,209 --> 01:07:22,164
Jimmy, it's me.

798
01:07:24,449 --> 01:07:28,124
Oz, what the hell were you thinkin',
takin' off with Cynthia?

799
01:07:28,249 --> 01:07:31,446
I'm sorry. But I can't let you kill her.

800
01:07:31,569 --> 01:07:35,278
What do you mean?
That's got nothin' to do with you!

801
01:07:35,409 --> 01:07:37,764
Jimmy, I'm in love with her.

802
01:07:38,729 --> 01:07:40,879
Look. I...

803
01:07:43,289 --> 01:07:45,484
- What did you just say?
- I love her.

804
01:07:49,849 --> 01:07:52,886
What are you talkin' about, you love her?
You just met her!

805
01:07:53,009 --> 01:07:55,204
- He said he's in love with Cynthia.
- No shit!

806
01:07:55,329 --> 01:07:57,445
- So she's the one!
- She's the one what?

807
01:07:57,569 --> 01:08:00,527
- The one he schtupped in Chicago!
- The one he...

808
01:08:02,289 --> 01:08:04,245
My wife.

809
01:08:05,689 --> 01:08:07,725
You schtupped my wife, Oz?

810
01:08:08,129 --> 01:08:12,327
I wouldn't exactly necessarily
phrase it that way, exactly.

811
01:08:12,449 --> 01:08:17,159
No, wait, wait! You went to Chicago and
engaged in sexual congress with my wife?

812
01:08:17,289 --> 01:08:19,245
Is that what you're telling me?

813
01:08:19,369 --> 01:08:21,325
- Is that it? Is...
- Jimmy, calm down.

814
01:08:21,449 --> 01:08:23,201
I swear to God...

815
01:08:23,329 --> 01:08:26,799
He's a little upset.
I've managed to upset a mass murderer.

816
01:08:28,529 --> 01:08:31,043
Find out where he is. Just stay right there.

817
01:08:31,329 --> 01:08:34,765
- Oz, you stud, you!
- Gonna be a dead stud.

818
01:08:36,169 --> 01:08:39,002
Tell Jimmy I might have thought
of a win-win way out of this.

819
01:08:39,129 --> 01:08:41,438
I know you got a couple
of bodies lying around.

820
01:08:41,569 --> 01:08:43,924
Yeah, and get this. One of 'em's a cop.

821
01:08:44,929 --> 01:08:47,489
What's he sayin'? What's he sayin'?!

822
01:08:48,609 --> 01:08:51,169
Tell him to stay where he is
and I'll be right there.

823
01:08:51,289 --> 01:08:54,998
That sounds great. I'm gonna run it
by the boys and I'll beep you right back.

824
01:08:55,129 --> 01:08:57,324
OK. Bye.

825
01:08:59,049 --> 01:09:03,361
Jimmy, when was the last time
you went to the dentist?

826
01:09:06,089 --> 01:09:08,080
You really meant it, didn't you?

827
01:09:08,209 --> 01:09:10,165
What you said.

828
01:09:10,289 --> 01:09:15,568
About what? Loving you? Of course!
What did you think this was all about?

829
01:09:15,689 --> 01:09:17,441
Sex.

830
01:09:17,569 --> 01:09:20,606
- I mean great sex, but...
- It was pretty good.

831
01:09:23,929 --> 01:09:26,284
Is that all this has meant to you?

832
01:09:27,649 --> 01:09:29,879
Don't get me wrong, Oz. I like you a lot.

833
01:09:30,129 --> 01:09:33,485
Well, that's great to hear,
but I've got news for you.

834
01:09:33,609 --> 01:09:37,807
I don't usually go round risking my life
for people thatjust like me.

835
01:09:40,929 --> 01:09:43,159
Well, I do like you.

836
01:09:44,449 --> 01:09:46,519
But...

837
01:09:49,329 --> 01:09:51,559
Then again, who knows? Maybe...

838
01:09:51,689 --> 01:09:55,523
Maybe this feeling I've been having
in the pit of my stomach...

839
01:09:55,969 --> 01:09:58,085
Maybe it's love.

840
01:09:58,929 --> 01:10:00,885
It's your beeper.

841
01:10:01,009 --> 01:10:02,965
I know.

842
01:10:07,129 --> 01:10:09,484
- Yeah?
- It's me.

843
01:10:10,369 --> 01:10:14,157
- I'll tell you one thing. You got balls.
- Yeah. Who knew?

844
01:10:14,289 --> 01:10:16,803
Jill told me your idea.

845
01:10:16,929 --> 01:10:18,248
And...

846
01:10:22,609 --> 01:10:24,804
I think it's worth a try.

847
01:10:26,849 --> 01:10:29,921
- Jimmy, thank you.
- Butjust so you know...

848
01:10:30,969 --> 01:10:32,925
I am disappointed, Oz.

849
01:10:33,689 --> 01:10:37,238
I am extremely disappointed with you.

850
01:10:37,369 --> 01:10:40,600
You are the last person
I would ever wanna disappoint,

851
01:10:40,729 --> 01:10:43,721
but everything I did was for love.

852
01:10:45,929 --> 01:10:47,885
Yeah, whatever.

853
01:10:49,849 --> 01:10:52,443
- See you at your office.
- OK. Gimme an hour.

854
01:10:52,569 --> 01:10:54,719
Oh, and don't forget the corpse!

855
01:11:04,129 --> 01:11:08,805
- Merci. Monsieur Boulez, remember to floss.
- De rien. C'est mon plaisir.

856
01:11:11,009 --> 01:11:13,079
Stay on the boat. Take this.

857
01:11:13,209 --> 01:11:18,124
If you don't hear from me in two hours,
just go. Disappear. Leave the country.

858
01:11:19,129 --> 01:11:21,085
Oz!

859
01:11:21,769 --> 01:11:23,725
Be careful.

860
01:11:27,209 --> 01:11:29,165
I'm Mr Careful.

861
01:12:05,449 --> 01:12:08,600
Oz. I just wanted to make sure it was you.

862
01:12:09,169 --> 01:12:12,400
Everybody's inside. By the way,

863
01:12:12,529 --> 01:12:14,201
huevos grandes, amigo!

864
01:12:21,689 --> 01:12:23,645
The great and powerful Oz.

865
01:12:27,049 --> 01:12:29,404
Why don't we get started?

866
01:13:54,209 --> 01:13:55,801
So far, so good.

867
01:14:01,769 --> 01:14:03,725
- Is he up?
- Yeah, got him.

868
01:14:04,449 --> 01:14:06,405
Let's see if he stays...

869
01:14:06,529 --> 01:14:08,804
All right. Frankie, duct tape.

870
01:14:22,449 --> 01:14:24,246
We did it.

871
01:14:25,769 --> 01:14:27,725
Yeah, I think we're good.

872
01:14:30,169 --> 01:14:32,125
- Barbecue?
- Barbecue.

873
01:14:47,609 --> 01:14:50,726
It really turned out to be a nice night tonight.

874
01:14:55,809 --> 01:14:57,765
OK. I'll be right back.

875
01:15:02,209 --> 01:15:05,246
- Who's this remind you of?
- Old Charlie, baby.

876
01:15:13,929 --> 01:15:15,760
All right.

877
01:15:16,049 --> 01:15:18,005
OK!

878
01:15:49,009 --> 01:15:51,477
Doctor? These men need to see you.

879
01:15:54,089 --> 01:15:55,602
Excuse me.

880
01:15:56,089 --> 01:15:58,045
Right this way, gentlemen.

881
01:16:00,329 --> 01:16:05,164
Dr Oseransky, I'm Sergeant Buchanan.
This is Officer Morrissey.

882
01:16:06,449 --> 01:16:08,804
Yes, well, what can I do for you?

883
01:16:11,809 --> 01:16:14,767
Are you the owner of a brown Toyota Corolla,

884
01:16:14,889 --> 01:16:18,120
licence number ZSJ 959?

885
01:16:18,369 --> 01:16:22,521
- Yes. Is there a problem?
- Do you know where your vehicle is, sir?

886
01:16:22,849 --> 01:16:27,445
- I lent it to my neighbour. He went fishing.
- This neighbour. He got a name?

887
01:16:28,809 --> 01:16:30,765
Jimmy Jones.

888
01:16:32,969 --> 01:16:36,166
Would you mind taking us
to his place of residence?

889
01:16:36,289 --> 01:16:39,725
Your car was found
by the grain silo at the Old Port.

890
01:16:39,849 --> 01:16:44,047
- Two bodies were in it. There had been a fire.
- Oh, my God.

891
01:16:44,169 --> 01:16:47,605
The extent of the burns made
normal identification impossible,

892
01:16:47,729 --> 01:16:49,685
so dental impressions were taken.

893
01:16:49,809 --> 01:16:52,369
And from the records,
we were able to establish

894
01:16:52,489 --> 01:16:57,961
that the bodies were those of one Janni
Pytor Gogolak and James Stefan Tudeski.

895
01:16:58,089 --> 01:17:02,321
Both of them were big shots
in a Chicago crime syndicate.

896
01:17:03,369 --> 01:17:06,122
- And you think this James...
- Tudeski.

897
01:17:06,569 --> 01:17:10,642
...is the Jimmy I know?
- That's what we intend to find out.

898
01:17:21,569 --> 01:17:23,525
Isn't that Hanson's car?

899
01:17:25,369 --> 01:17:27,325
Go have a look.

900
01:17:29,809 --> 01:17:32,926
- Who's... who's Hanson?
- One of our men.

901
01:17:33,049 --> 01:17:35,483
He was on an undercover assignment.

902
01:17:35,609 --> 01:17:40,364
There was some concern earlier
because he failed to check in this morning.

903
01:17:54,369 --> 01:17:56,564
Your mother, she knows about this?

904
01:17:56,689 --> 01:17:59,203
My mother wants this
to happen as much as I do.

905
01:17:59,329 --> 01:18:02,002
And I really, really want this to happen.

906
01:18:08,009 --> 01:18:11,240
It's Hanson's car all right.
But no sign of Hanson.

907
01:18:11,369 --> 01:18:13,325
But I found a tape.

908
01:18:24,929 --> 01:18:28,478
Dr Oseransky, could you tell us
where your wife might be?

909
01:18:28,609 --> 01:18:32,238
My wife? She's in Niagara Falls
with her mother. Why?

910
01:18:33,489 --> 01:18:35,923
I don't know how to tell you this,

911
01:18:36,049 --> 01:18:40,565
but it seems that your wife recently
tried to hire a hit man to kill you.

912
01:18:40,689 --> 01:18:42,884
A hit man?

913
01:18:43,089 --> 01:18:44,283
Oh, my God!

914
01:18:51,609 --> 01:18:53,964
There's no smoking in here.

915
01:19:00,969 --> 01:19:03,199
So where is he, Mrs Oseransky?

916
01:19:03,329 --> 01:19:06,799
...questions and you better have answers!
- Hi, Mom!

917
01:19:08,849 --> 01:19:12,159
You can ask me questions,
but until I speak to my attorney...

918
01:19:12,289 --> 01:19:16,077
You spoke to him.
He doesn't want anything to do with you!

919
01:19:16,329 --> 01:19:19,719
Special Agent Hanson, Mrs Oseransky.
What did you do to him?

920
01:19:19,849 --> 01:19:22,488
- Wasn't me.
- We have your voice on tape!

921
01:19:22,929 --> 01:19:28,162
His written reports! We know you tried to hire
him to kill your husband. So what happened?

922
01:19:28,289 --> 01:19:32,680
Did he try to back out?
He tried to back out and you killed him.

923
01:19:32,809 --> 01:19:36,006
None of this would have happened
if that girl had done herjob!

924
01:19:36,129 --> 01:19:37,960
- What girl?
- Jill!

925
01:19:38,089 --> 01:19:40,478
My husband's receptionist.

926
01:19:40,609 --> 01:19:45,763
- Oh, yeah? Well, is she a contract killer, too?
- Yes! I hired her! She's the killer.

927
01:19:52,889 --> 01:19:55,323
This would be sad if it wasn't so pathetic.

928
01:19:55,449 --> 01:19:57,565
Do you wanna talk to her?

929
01:19:57,689 --> 01:20:00,408
No. No, I don't think so.

930
01:20:00,529 --> 01:20:02,485
Mm. I don't blame you.

931
01:20:03,369 --> 01:20:05,883
You guys know a good divorce lawyer?

932
01:20:06,009 --> 01:20:09,399
She did it! She's a killer!
You've got to believe me!

933
01:20:16,449 --> 01:20:19,441
Don't worry. I got all the i's dotted
and all the t's crossed.

934
01:20:19,569 --> 01:20:24,245
- Jimmy's got his own way of spelling.
- I will take care of him. You needn't see him.

935
01:20:24,369 --> 01:20:27,725
You and Jill go to the bank.
Jimmy and I'll be at the fine-art museum.

936
01:20:27,849 --> 01:20:31,285
- Jimmy at a fine-art museum?
- There's people at a fine-art museum.

937
01:20:31,409 --> 01:20:35,641
- He's not gonna try anything.
- All right. If you say so.

938
01:20:47,689 --> 01:20:49,645
Where's Cynthia?

939
01:20:51,009 --> 01:20:52,965
You and I are leaving.

940
01:20:57,169 --> 01:21:00,878
I'll beep Cynthia. She'll call you
on that phone and tell you where to go.

941
01:21:01,129 --> 01:21:03,279
Listen to him. Mr Cloak-and-Dagger!

942
01:21:03,729 --> 01:21:06,687
- I'm being careful. I'm a dentist.
- Yeah.

943
01:21:11,849 --> 01:21:13,805
You boys play nice, now.

944
01:21:18,529 --> 01:21:20,918
Take us to the art museum.

945
01:21:21,889 --> 01:21:27,168
You think if Cynthia doesn't come through,
you're gonna be any safer at the art museum?

946
01:21:39,649 --> 01:21:41,605
Hello.

947
01:21:42,849 --> 01:21:44,726
Yeah. Yeah.

948
01:21:45,009 --> 01:21:48,558
I hope there was nothing special
you wanted to see at the art museum.

949
01:21:48,689 --> 01:21:51,078
- Why?
- Cos we're not going to the art museum.

950
01:21:51,209 --> 01:21:53,086
We're going to the marina.

951
01:21:53,209 --> 01:21:55,120
- The marina?
- Yeah.

952
01:21:55,249 --> 01:21:57,479
I rented a boat for the day.

953
01:21:57,609 --> 01:21:59,645
Ain't that right, Frankie?

954
01:22:04,809 --> 01:22:08,358
See? I'm careful, too.

955
01:22:48,689 --> 01:22:50,645
You're Jill?

956
01:22:51,809 --> 01:22:53,765
Nice to meet you.

957
01:22:54,569 --> 01:22:58,198
- Where's your gun?
- What makes you think I have a gun?

958
01:23:10,129 --> 01:23:12,085
Throw it in.

959
01:23:18,369 --> 01:23:20,644
Do you have the certificates?

960
01:23:21,689 --> 01:23:23,645
Let's go banking.

961
01:23:28,529 --> 01:23:30,520
Everything seems to be in order.

962
01:23:30,649 --> 01:23:34,324
- Where would you like the money sent?
- To a bank in the Caymans.

963
01:23:34,449 --> 01:23:36,963
- The account number is 0...
- Can we have a minute?

964
01:23:37,089 --> 01:23:38,807
- Certainly.
- Thanks.

965
01:23:38,929 --> 01:23:40,885
I'll be right over there.

966
01:23:48,169 --> 01:23:51,479
We could just walk away, you know.
You and me.

967
01:23:52,089 --> 01:23:54,045
With the whole ten million.

968
01:23:59,369 --> 01:24:01,724
So? What do you think?

969
01:24:07,169 --> 01:24:09,160
I think...

970
01:24:09,289 --> 01:24:13,282
- I know that if we did, Jimmy would kill Oz.
- So what?

971
01:24:19,809 --> 01:24:23,438
- You're a lucky guy, Oz.
- Why would you say that?

972
01:24:24,209 --> 01:24:28,327
You're about to find out
if the woman you love really loves you.

973
01:24:28,449 --> 01:24:30,121
Want a beer?

974
01:24:30,889 --> 01:24:33,323
If it was me, if I was in her position,

975
01:24:34,649 --> 01:24:37,209
I'd just take the money and run.

976
01:24:39,369 --> 01:24:41,325
So what are you bettin' on?

977
01:24:41,929 --> 01:24:44,363
I'm betting on love.

978
01:24:44,489 --> 01:24:50,678
Love for you means money for me. And like I
said before, I'd really hate to have to kill you.

979
01:25:04,209 --> 01:25:08,680
- So when are you gonna do it?
- Let's just make sure we got the money first.

980
01:25:10,929 --> 01:25:13,284
But you are intendin' to kill him?

981
01:25:15,489 --> 01:25:21,200
Jimmy, listen. He was there! He was there
when you killed Janni and a cop!

982
01:25:21,329 --> 01:25:23,889
Now, I know you like this guy...

983
01:25:24,489 --> 01:25:27,481
- Yeah. I do.
- But he's got to go.

984
01:25:28,049 --> 01:25:32,520
- And if you ain't prepared to do it, then I...
- Hey, Frankie, Frankie!

985
01:25:32,649 --> 01:25:35,288
Let's not forget who you're talking to, OK?

986
01:25:36,849 --> 01:25:38,919
Jimmy Tudeski may be dead,

987
01:25:39,049 --> 01:25:41,643
but he ain't exactly dead. Understand?

988
01:25:43,289 --> 01:25:47,248
- Glad to hear it.
- Just drive the boat.

989
01:25:51,729 --> 01:25:56,120
Think about it, Cynthia. We're talking
about five million dollars apiece here.

990
01:25:56,249 --> 01:25:59,207
Is Oz really worth that much to you?

991
01:26:00,849 --> 01:26:02,805
The thing is... is...

992
01:26:04,729 --> 01:26:07,289
- I think I love him.
- You think? You think?

993
01:26:07,449 --> 01:26:11,408
Sweetheart, for five million dollars,
you better be damn certain!

994
01:26:13,849 --> 01:26:15,680
I am.

995
01:26:15,809 --> 01:26:19,484
I'm sorry, but I... I love him.

996
01:26:20,969 --> 01:26:23,688
You do? That's the right answer.

997
01:26:24,369 --> 01:26:26,599
Yo, guy! You can get back here now.

998
01:26:32,529 --> 01:26:34,565
Yeah?

999
01:26:34,689 --> 01:26:36,645
Yeah.

1000
01:26:38,009 --> 01:26:40,159
OK.

1001
01:26:41,529 --> 01:26:43,485
OK.

1002
01:26:45,369 --> 01:26:47,325
We got the money.

1003
01:26:51,969 --> 01:26:53,721
Bye-bye, Oz.

1004
01:26:55,689 --> 01:26:57,645
What...

1005
01:27:05,129 --> 01:27:08,838
Sorry, Frankie. I always liked you.

1006
01:27:11,209 --> 01:27:13,518
Wh... Why... Why did you kill him?!

1007
01:27:13,649 --> 01:27:15,605
Well, I had to kill one of you.

1008
01:27:17,769 --> 01:27:21,000
Well, then, you definitely
made the right decision.

1009
01:27:24,249 --> 01:27:26,604
Why did you have to kill him?!

1010
01:27:30,929 --> 01:27:33,841
Well, if I didn't kill you, Frankie would have.

1011
01:27:34,889 --> 01:27:38,928
And... he would have thought
that I'd gone soft,

1012
01:27:40,049 --> 01:27:43,086
eventually come after me and the money.

1013
01:27:46,769 --> 01:27:50,523
So... what about me?

1014
01:27:52,049 --> 01:27:55,086
I want the bulk of the money
to be put into this account.

1015
01:27:55,209 --> 01:27:58,087
I also want one million dollars
placed in this account

1016
01:27:58,209 --> 01:28:01,645
under the name of Dr Nicholas
and Mrs Cynthia Oseransky.

1017
01:28:01,889 --> 01:28:04,039
- One million dollars...
- What?

1018
01:28:04,569 --> 01:28:07,003
An early wedding present from Jimmy.

1019
01:28:08,929 --> 01:28:11,079
Not that Jimmy.

1020
01:28:12,329 --> 01:28:14,923
- Can we have another minute?
- Certainly.

1021
01:28:15,249 --> 01:28:17,205
- Thanks.
- I'll just...

1022
01:28:21,409 --> 01:28:24,048
- Is this for real?
- Yes, but to get the money,

1023
01:28:24,169 --> 01:28:29,004
you have to show up together and show them
a copy of a validated marriage certificate.

1024
01:28:29,129 --> 01:28:32,360
- Jimmy's giving me a divorce?
- Don't you read the papers, lady?

1025
01:28:32,489 --> 01:28:34,366
Jimmy Tudeski's dead.

1026
01:28:41,009 --> 01:28:44,365
- I don't know what to say.
- When the time comes... just say "I do".

1027
01:28:46,449 --> 01:28:47,518
Yo!

1028
01:28:47,769 --> 01:28:51,603
Maybe I am going soft. In the old days,
I would have definitely killed you.

1029
01:28:51,849 --> 01:28:53,805
Don't be so hard on yourself.

1030
01:28:56,049 --> 01:28:58,438
Or... I dunno.

1031
01:28:59,769 --> 01:29:02,124
Maybe I have changed since my death.

1032
01:29:03,849 --> 01:29:07,364
- I don't think that's what it is.
- What do you mean?

1033
01:29:09,409 --> 01:29:12,162
- You love her, don't you?
- Cynthia?

1034
01:29:28,009 --> 01:29:31,968
Hi, Oz. Cynthia's waiting for you.
She said you'd know where.

1035
01:29:36,049 --> 01:29:38,609
Say hi to my widow for me, will you?

1036
01:29:40,569 --> 01:29:42,525
Take care of yourself.

1037
01:30:01,889 --> 01:30:03,845
Marry me.

1038
01:30:08,969 --> 01:30:11,642
Jimmy told you.

1039
01:30:11,769 --> 01:30:13,725
What?

1040
01:30:15,849 --> 01:30:17,805
He didn't, did he?

1041
01:30:20,889 --> 01:30:24,086
You just... wanna marry me?

1042
01:30:24,209 --> 01:30:26,165
No.

1043
01:30:27,209 --> 01:30:31,646
No, I don'tjust wanna marry you.
I wanna marry you more than anyone's

1044
01:30:31,769 --> 01:30:35,921
wanted to marry anyone
in the history of the world.

1045
01:30:39,609 --> 01:30:42,169
Then would I be out of line if I told you...

1046
01:30:43,769 --> 01:30:45,725
that I loved you?

1047
01:30:56,649 --> 01:30:58,605
And said "Yes"?

1048
01:31:00,889 --> 01:31:04,325
- I would love to marry you.
- So you...

1049
01:31:04,449 --> 01:31:08,567
wouldn't mind spending
the rest of your life with a poor dentist?

1050
01:31:08,689 --> 01:31:11,044
Somethin' tells me we'll get by.

1051
01:31:17,689 --> 01:31:20,249
They all laughed at Christopher Columbus

1052
01:31:20,369 --> 01:31:23,088
When he said the world was round

1053
01:31:23,649 --> 01:31:28,006
They all laughed
when Edison recorded sound

1054
01:31:29,489 --> 01:31:31,923
They all laughed at Wilbur and his brother

1055
01:31:32,049 --> 01:31:35,007
When they said that man could fly

1056
01:31:35,129 --> 01:31:37,802
They told Marconi wireless was a phoney

1057
01:31:38,209 --> 01:31:39,881
It's the same old cry

1058
01:31:40,009 --> 01:31:43,240
They laughed at me wanting you

1059
01:31:43,529 --> 01:31:45,997
Said I was reaching for the moon

1060
01:31:46,449 --> 01:31:49,407
But, ooh, you came through

1061
01:31:49,529 --> 01:31:52,362
Now they'll have to change their tune

1062
01:31:53,169 --> 01:31:55,444
They all said we never could be happy

1063
01:31:55,689 --> 01:31:58,123
They laughed at us and how

1064
01:31:58,409 --> 01:31:59,922
But ho, ho, ho

1065
01:32:00,049 --> 01:32:03,644
Who's got the last laugh now?

1066
01:32:04,809 --> 01:32:07,198
They all laughed at Rockefeller Center

1067
01:32:07,329 --> 01:32:10,207
Now they're fighting to get in

1068
01:32:10,609 --> 01:32:14,921
They all laughed
at Whitney and his cotton gin

1069
01:32:16,529 --> 01:32:19,043
They all laughed
at Fulton and his steamboat

1070
01:32:19,169 --> 01:32:21,888
Hershey and his chocolate bar

1071
01:32:22,009 --> 01:32:23,488
Ford and his Lizzy

1072
01:32:23,609 --> 01:32:25,327
Kept the laughers busy

1073
01:32:25,449 --> 01:32:26,598
That's how people are

1074
01:32:26,729 --> 01:32:30,199
They laughed at me wanting you

1075
01:32:30,329 --> 01:32:33,287
Said it'll be hello, goodbye

1076
01:32:33,609 --> 01:32:36,077
And, ooh, you came through

1077
01:32:36,209 --> 01:32:39,519
Now they're eating humble pie

1078
01:32:39,849 --> 01:32:42,283
They all said we'd never get together

1079
01:32:42,409 --> 01:32:44,923
Darling, let's take a bow

1080
01:32:45,049 --> 01:32:46,562
For ho, ho, ho

1081
01:32:46,689 --> 01:32:51,001
Who's got the last laugh now?

1082
01:33:58,529 --> 01:34:01,839
They laughed at me wanting you

1083
01:34:01,969 --> 01:34:05,245
Said it would be hello, goodbye

1084
01:34:05,369 --> 01:34:07,837
But, ooh, you came through

1085
01:34:07,969 --> 01:34:11,086
Now they're eating humble pie

1086
01:34:11,529 --> 01:34:14,248
They all said we'd never get together

1087
01:34:14,369 --> 01:34:16,485
Darling, let's take a bow

1088
01:34:16,609 --> 01:34:18,361
For ho, ho, ho

1089
01:34:18,489 --> 01:34:19,808
Who's got the last laugh?

1090
01:34:19,929 --> 01:34:21,157
Hee, hee, hee

1091
01:34:21,289 --> 01:34:22,847
Let's have the past laugh

1092
01:34:22,969 --> 01:34:30,364
Ha, ha, ha, who's got the last laugh now?

1093
01:34:35,209 --> 01:34:38,167
