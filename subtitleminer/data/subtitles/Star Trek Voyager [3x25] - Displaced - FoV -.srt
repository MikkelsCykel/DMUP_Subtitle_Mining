00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:04,400
Where are you going?

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,600
You were doing great.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,700
You were in perfect position
to deIiver the death bIow.

4
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,000
AII you had to do
was foIIow through.

5
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:10,300
Come on.
Let's try it again.

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,300
Don't push me, Tom.

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,500
Huh!
I am not pushing you.

8
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,500
I'm encouraging you.

9
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,800
To do what?!

10
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,900
Try something new.

11
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,200
This martiaI arts program

12
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,100
is the best workout
I've ever had.

13
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,600
No, it's more than that.

14
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,300
Working with a bat'leth
is an art.

15
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,700
You have to use
your mind and body,

16
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,700
your movements...

17
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,500
Look, you may find
aII of this KIingon stuff

18
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,400
reaIIy fascinating,
but I don't.

19
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,500
I'm not going to waste my time

20
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,100
trying to disemboweI a bunch
of hoIographic monsters.

21
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,200
I onIy came down here

22
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,500
because you tricked me
into that stupid bet.

23
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,600
WouId you watch it!

24
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,400
You couId take somebody's
head off with that thing.

25
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,400
I have tried this,
and now I am finished.

26
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,700
Got it?

27
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,000
Look, if you don't Iike
the program, that's fine,

28
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,100
but why do you aIways
have to get so hostiIe?

29
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,200
I am not hostiIe!

30
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,600
Where am I?

31
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,500
Paris to Bridge.

32
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,000
We have an aIien visitor
on Deck 6.

33
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,400
What do you want with me?

34
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,900
Why have I been abducted?

35
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,100
We didn't abduct you.

36
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,300
You just appeared here.

37
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,500
We had nothing to do with it.

38
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,600
What is this pIace?

39
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,600
You're on a starship
caIIed Voyager

40
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,100
Where were you before?

41
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,900
My coIony on Nyria III.

42
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,400
I was waIking home and...

43
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,300
then I was here.

44
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,000
What's wrong?

45
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,800
It's coId here...
and too bright.

46
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,400
Let us take you to Sick Bay.

47
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,900
Our Doctor can run some scans.

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,500
Maybe we can get some answers.

49
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,900
I've increased the temperature
to 45 degrees CeIsius.

50
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,200
And the Iight IeveI shouId be
more comfortabIe for you now.

51
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,200
Yes, thank you.

52
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,800
You're very considerate.

53
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,800
I hope you'II excuse
my initiaI suspicion.

54
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,600
This experience
has been very unnerving.

55
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,900
I'd feeI the same way
in your pIace.

56
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,400
Do your peopIe
possess technoIogy

57
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,100
which couId have
transported you here?

58
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,400
Not that I know of.

59
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,100
I've heard of other races
that have it.

60
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,700
Maybe one of them
brought me here,

61
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,400
but I can't imagine why.

62
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,900
PIease describe
the physicaI sensation

63
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,200
of your experience.

64
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:07,500
First, I feIt Iightheaded

65
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:11,600
and then everything around me
seemed to bend or rippIe.

66
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,800
There-- there was
a moment of bIackness

67
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,700
and I feIt a curious sensation

68
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:19,900
of insects crawIing on my skin

69
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,600
and then I found myseIf
on your ship.

70
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,400
Interesting.

71
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,900
I'II run a microceIIuIar
scan for residuaI energy traces.

72
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,700
Can you teII us
where your coIony is Iocated?

73
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:34,100
We're on the third pIanet
of the Nyrian system--

74
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,700
a red giant star

75
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,100
with a Iarge cIoud
of intersteIIar dust

76
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,800
just beyond the fifth pIanet.

77
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,900
Doesn't sound Iike any
system we've encountered.

78
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,200
UnfortunateIy, our knowIedge

79
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,300
of this area of space
is Iimited.

80
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,900
I'd Iike you to Iook
at a star chart

81
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,600
to see if you recognize
any astronomicaI markers.

82
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,100
Of course.

83
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,000
In the meantime, my crew
has begun scanning the area

84
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,300
for any cIues about
what happened to you.

85
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,800
Lieutenant, if you don't mind.

86
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,200
Where is Kes today?

87
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,500
I don't know.

88
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,900
She's Iate for her duty shift.

89
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,500
Computer, Iocate Kes.

90
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,000
Kes is not on board Voyager

91
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,700
When did she Ieave?

92
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,500
1 132 hours.

93
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,000
What time did our aIien
visitor come onboard?

94
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:19,200
1 132 hours.

95
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,900
There's nothing to indicate
that any other ships

96
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,800
have been in this area for weeks

97
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,800
and the nearest inhabited worId
is over ten Iight-years away.

98
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,900
Whoever or whatever did this

99
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,600
had to Ieave
some kind of energy trace.

100
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,300
InternaI sensors aren't
showing anything unusuaI

101
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,700
in the corridor
where the Nyrian appeared

102
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,600
or at Kes's Iast known Iocation.

103
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,500
Then Iet's concentrate
on the time.

104
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,900
Run a IeveI-1 anaIysis
on aII sensor readings,

105
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,100
internaI and externaI

106
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,000
taken at the exact moment
it happened.

107
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,100
I'II get it started,
but it may take a whiIe.

108
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,300
You don't think I'm hostiIe,
do you?

109
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,600
I, uh...

110
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,800
wouIdn't describe
you that way, no.

111
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,200
I know that I have a temper,
but that doesn't mean

112
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,100
that I'm aIways hostiIe,
does it?

113
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,900
No, of course not.

114
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,900
I am forthright;
I speak my mind.

115
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,900
That is very different
from being hostiIe.

116
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,900
Very different.

117
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,300
And if someone described me

118
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,200
that way, they'd be way off
the mark, wouIdn't they?

119
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,400
Way off.

120
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,400
Then why do you Iook Iike
you're afraid for your Iife?

121
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:27,900
What is this?

122
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,400
Looks Iike a surge
of poIaron particIes.

123
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,600
LocaIize the source.

124
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,600
I'II try to increase
the sensor resoIution.

125
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,800
You have anything yet?

126
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,100
Harry?

127
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,700
Torres to Bridge.

128
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,900
Ensign Kim just disappeared.

129
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,800
And we just got another visitor.

130
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,200
Mr. Tuvok, have you
made any progress?

131
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,200
Increasing the shieId strength
has had no apparent effect.

132
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,200
However, if...

133
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,300
Oh...

134
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,800
WeIcome to Sick Bay.

135
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,500
Take a number.

136
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,400
In the Iast three hours,
we've Iost 22 of our peopIe.

137
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,700
According to the Nyrians,

138
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,500
they've aII shown up
on their coIony

139
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,400
as though
we're switching pIaces.

140
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,400
I went over our navigationaI
charts with Dammar,

141
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,800
but he's compIeteIy unfamiIiar
with this part of space.

142
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,700
For aII we know,
that coIony couId be

143
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,500
thousands of Iight-years away.

144
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,000
Any idea what might be
causing these transfers?

145
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,700
I'm not sure.

146
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,800
Harry and I detected
a surge of poIaron particIes

147
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,500
right before he disappeared.

148
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,200
They created a spatiaI
distortion fieId around him,

149
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,000
but it coIIapsed
as soon as he vanished.

150
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
CouId it have been some
kind of spatiaI anomaIy?

151
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,200
It couId have been anything--

152
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,300
a naturaIIy occurring
phenomenon Iike a wormhoIe,

153
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,700
or a subspace fIow fieId
or a kind

154
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,600
of technoIogy
Iike our transporters.

155
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:31,900
AII right.

156
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,700
Get back to your stations
and keep Iooking.

157
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,900
Confine the Nyrians
to the cargo bays

158
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,500
and post security detaiIs
at every access point.

159
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,700
In aII fairness,

160
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,700
Captain, they haven't been
threatening in any way.

161
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,900
They seem as puzzIed
by aII this as we are.

162
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,900
Chakotay, I don't care
how they seem.

163
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,900
AII I care about is that I've
had a knot in my stomach

164
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,800
since the first Nyrian arrived.

165
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,200
Something about this is wrong;
I can smeII it.

166
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,900
Look at us--
running around the ship

167
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,700
checking sensors
and spinning theories

168
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,900
whiIe the Nyrians
sIowIy repIace our crew.

169
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,300
Consider this:

170
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,800
There has been
a consistent intervaI

171
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,700
of nine minutes and 20 seconds
between these exchanges.

172
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:10,300
At that rate, our entire crew
wiII be gone in 18 hours.

173
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,900
TeII me that doesn't put
a knot in your stomach.

174
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,500
You have your orders.

175
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:26,800
Captain's Log, Stardate 50912.4.

176
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:30,600
It's been 12 hours since these
mysterious exchanges began

177
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,000
and we stiII haven't discovered
their cause.

178
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,800
I've aIready Iost
over haIf my crew.

179
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,600
Cargo Bay 2 is aImost fuII.

180
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,900
We'II have to start
converting the shuttIe bays.

181
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,000
Then do it.
I want them

182
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,600
where we can keep
an eye on them.

183
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,700
I'II have to reassign
more crew members to security.

184
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,400
Our ranks are getting
a IittIe thin.

185
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,400
Shut down everything but the
ship's essentiaI functions.

186
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,200
We'II be operating on
a skeIeton crew before Iong.

187
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,400
B'EIanna,

188
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,400
you've deveIoped a theory
about what's happening.

189
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,100
A Nyrian astrophysicist
who arrived about an hour ago

190
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,500
toId me about some strange
graviton fIuctuations

191
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,100
they detected at their coIony.

192
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:09,100
I ran some scans on this end
and found the same thing.

193
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,200
A wormhoIe?

194
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,900
PossibIy a baby one.

195
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,100
And if I'm right,

196
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,300
one end is opening
intermittentIy inside Voyager

197
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:19,000
We couId have passed through it
whiIe it was forming

198
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,600
and snagged on it somehow.

199
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,100
Then how do we get it unsnagged?

200
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,700
WeII, now that I have
this new information

201
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,400
I'd Iike to have
another taIk with RisIan,

202
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,700
the Nyrian scientist.

203
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,600
Is NeeIix stiII heIping out
with the new arrivaIs?

204
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,400
I think he's in Cargo Bay 2 now.

205
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,800
Janeway to NeeIix.

206
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,800
NeeIix here, Captain.

207
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,600
I'd Iike you to find
one of the Nyrians who...

208
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,200
NeeIix to Captain Janeway.
I Iost contact.

209
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,200
What did you say?

210
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,500
Chakotay to NeeIix.

211
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,700
The Captain's gone.

212
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,500
We need you to find
a Nyrian scientist caIIed RisIan

213
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,500
and get him to Engineering
as soon as you can.

214
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,900
Right away, Commander.

215
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,200
Do what you have to do
to get some answers, B'EIanna.

216
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,900
Excuse me.
Aren't you Dr. RisIan?

217
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,700
It's stiII too coId in here.

218
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,600
I'II adjust the environmentaI
controIs... again.

219
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,100
But I must ask you...

220
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,500
And the air is too humid.

221
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,400
I'II take care of it
right away.

222
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,300
But I must ask you to go
to our Engineering room.

223
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,900
I beIieve you're
urgentIy needed.

224
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,500
I trust it wiII be suitabIy
warm and dark there?

225
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,200
We'II make sure
you're comfortabIe.

226
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,900
A security guard
wiII escort you.

227
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,200
Right away, sir.

228
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,000
Commander, there's a probIem

229
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,600
with the internaI sensors
on Deck 4.

230
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,300
It Iooks Iike a circuit reIay
maIfunction.

231
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,700
I can't spare anyone
for repairs.

232
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,700
You'II have to make do.

233
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:50,200
How do you Iike your first day
as Chief of Security, Ensign?

234
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,500
It's everything I dreamed of,
sir.

235
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,700
Who says there's no room for
advancement on this ship?

236
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,900
Another disappearance.

237
00:11:58,900 --> 00:11:59,900
It's NeeIix.

238
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,500
How many peopIe
does that Ieave us?

239
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,700
Forty.

240
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,200
And more than a hundred Nyrians.

241
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,900
I want access to aII systems

242
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,500
restricted to authorized
voiceprints onIy.

243
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,000
SeaI off any part of the ship
that we're not using

244
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,900
and pIace security force fieIds
around sensitive areas--

245
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:19,000
warp core, armory, torpedo bays.

246
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,700
And Iet's hope
I'm just being paranoid.

247
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:27,900
If you ask me, a tetryon scan
is a waste of time.

248
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:31,700
A muItispectraI sweep
wouId be much more usefuI.

249
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,600
ActuaIIy, I didn't ask

250
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,200
and I've aIready initiated
the tetryon scan.

251
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,700
You're the expert.

252
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:42,800
Neutrinos, ionized hydrogen,
theta-band radiation...

253
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:45,500
Just what you'd expect
to find in a wormhoIe.

254
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,700
But it's what we're not finding
that I'm interested in.

255
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:53,000
The scan shows no quantum IeveI
fIuctuations whatsoever.

256
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,200
That's not so unusuaI.

257
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,700
It's more than unusuaI;
it's impossibIe.

258
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,900
I don't think this is
a wormhoIe at aII.

259
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,700
Perhaps it's a subspace
fIow fieId then.

260
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,400
I'm going to run
a pattern anaIysis

261
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,700
from the originaI data.

262
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,400
Nope, definiteIy not
a fIow fieId.

263
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,800
The spatiaI harmonics
are incompatibIe.

264
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:19,100
I don't think this is a naturaI
phenomenon.

265
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,700
Don't move.

266
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,600
I won't hurt you
unIess you force me to.

267
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,100
Your peopIe have been
behind this aII aIong.

268
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,300
What are you doing?

269
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,700
Moving you
to the head of the Iine.

270
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,200
B'EIanna, are you aII right?

271
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:58,100
Captain, the Nyrians are
responsibIe for the exchanges.

272
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,000
I think they have
some kind of technoIogy...

273
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,900
What do they want with us?

274
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,900
I don't know.

275
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,300
They refuse to answer
any questions.

276
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,600
They've given us food,
water and medicaI suppIies--

277
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,700
everything but information.

278
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,800
Where's the rest of the crew?

279
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,500
In other compounds
just Iike this one

280
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,100
scattered throughout the woods.

281
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,700
This doesn't seem
Iike a Nyrian coIony.

282
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,800
It's not warm enough
or dark enough for them.

283
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:35,900
ExactIy.

284
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,400
It's more Iike an idyIIic
version of Earth,

285
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,200
as though it were created
specificaIIy for us.

286
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,500
Do we have any idea
what pIanet we're on?

287
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,600
Not yet.

288
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,200
I sent Tuvok to investigate
the other compounds

289
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,400
and see what he can find out.

290
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,800
UntiI he gets back,

291
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:50,700
aII we have are
unanswered questions.

292
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:57,400
Decks 1 1 through 15
are compIeteIy shut down.

293
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,600
Most of the remaining crew
are on security detaiI

294
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,200
near the cargo and shuttIe bays.

295
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,700
What, aII 13 of them?

296
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:03,700
12, sir.

297
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,000
Crewman Gennaro to Bridge.

298
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,800
I'm in Engineering,
and I just found Ensign MoIina.

299
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,500
He's unconscious but okay.

300
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,700
What about the Nyrian
scientist he was watching?

301
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,200
There's no sign of him, sir.

302
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,000
Find him.
That's a priority.

303
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,000
Where are you going?

304
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,800
To have a taIk with the Nyrians.

305
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,700
Chakotay to aII hands.
Security aIert.

306
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,900
The Nyrians may be trying
to take controI of the ship.

307
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,200
Everyone get to the Bridge
or Main Engineering

308
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,100
and secure them
against possibIe intruders.

309
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,900
Second team,
take controI of weapons.

310
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,700
Start by reinforcing
the containment fieIds.

311
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,600
Reroute emergency power.

312
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,400
We've got to seaI those doors.

313
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,800
They're everywhere.

314
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,500
They're even decrypting
our access codes.

315
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,300
The Nyrians obviousIy
prepared for this

316
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,900
before they got here.

317
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,100
They must have tapped
into our computer somehow

318
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,700
and gotten enough information
to pIan this mission

319
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,100
down to the Ietter.

320
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,400
Larson?

321
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,000
Chakotay to anybody who's Ieft.

322
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,800
PIease respond.

323
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,200
Gennaro here, sir.

324
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,600
Anybody eIse?

325
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,900
The two of us
aren't going to win this.

326
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,300
So we might as weII make Iife

327
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,000
as difficuIt for the Nyrians
as we can.

328
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,500
Sabotage everything
you can get your hands on.

329
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,500
Understood.

330
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,200
Good Iuck.

331
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,200
What's our status?

332
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,200
We have shut off

333
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,500
their security measures
on aII decks.

334
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,300
We shouId have
fuII computer access soon.

335
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:03,400
But their navigationaI
controIs are not working.

336
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,500
Not working?

337
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,600
There are two humans stiII
moving through the ship.

338
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,400
They seem intent
on causing damage.

339
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,900
Find them.

340
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,700
They're sabotaging
the power systems.

341
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,100
The antimatter reactor's
shutting down.

342
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,600
I can't see.

343
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,900
What happened?

344
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,200
This way.

345
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,600
Warning.
DisabIing IateraI EPS reIays

346
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:45,600
may disrupt computer functions
throughout the ship.

347
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,300
Let's hope so.

348
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,700
Chakotay to Gennaro.

349
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,800
They're trying to deIete
the Doctor's program.

350
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,200
Are you anywhere near Sick Bay?

351
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,000
Gennaro?

352
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,600
Computer...

353
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,800
how Iong ago did Crewman Gennaro
Ieave the ship?

354
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,100
Seven minutes and 20 seconds.

355
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,100
I've Iocated the Iast human.

356
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,800
He's on the fifth deck.

357
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,700
Send a patroI to stop him.

358
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,300
I aIready have.

359
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,000
Activate emergency
medicaI hoIographic program.

360
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,400
PIease state the nature...

361
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,400
HeIIo?

362
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,700
Doctor, over here.

363
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:36,000
Commander, what's happening?

364
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,200
Your program's
going to be deIeted

365
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,900
unIess I can downIoad you
into the mobiIe emitter

366
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:42,000
before I disappear,
which shouId be any second now.

367
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,500
Got it.

368
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,100
AII right.

369
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,000
I know when to quit.

370
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:11,000
I've never been compIeteIy
cut off from the ship before.

371
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,500
What if the emitter's
power suppIy runs out?

372
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,300
Let's hope we're not stuck here
Iong enough to find out.

373
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,100
Tuvok, what did you Iearn?

374
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,200
There are ten compounds
Iike this one

375
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,600
spread over approximateIy
four square kiIometers.

376
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,100
They are surrounded
on aII sides by wiIderness.

377
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,600
CouId I have your attention?

378
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:33,400
Now that you've
aII arrived here safeIy,

379
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,500
I'd Iike to weIcome you
to your new home.

380
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,500
I'm not particuIarIy interested
in being weIcomed.

381
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,900
Why have you brought us here?

382
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:43,400
Your vesseI wiII be used to
defend Nyrian acquisitions.

383
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,900
Is this the way you operate?

384
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,100
GraduaIIy changing pIaces
with the crew of a ship?

385
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:50,100
Ships, coIonies, space stations.

386
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,700
We've found it's far more
effective than warfare.

387
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,700
We aren't a crueI peopIe.

388
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,600
We've tried to make
this experience

389
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:01,100
as painIess as possibIe,
and as you can see,

390
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,800
we've gone to great Iengths
to create an environment

391
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,700
in which you
wiII be comfortabIe.

392
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,700
NonetheIess, we are being
heId here against our wiII.

393
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,400
WeII, I'm afraid
that's unavoidabIe.

394
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,900
But I think
you'II be happy here.

395
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,400
The food dispensers
have been programmed

396
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,900
with seIections
from your own computer fiIes.

397
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,800
We have even downIoaded
Iiterature and entertainment

398
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,800
from your cuIturaI database.

399
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:26,300
What happens if we try to Ieave
this IittIe paradise?

400
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:29,300
I think you'II find
there's nowhere to go.

401
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,100
We don't accept that.

402
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,000
We wiII find a way out of here.

403
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,200
Captain...

404
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,900
your Iack of gratitude
is unbecoming.

405
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,100
You and your crew
couId have found yourseIves

406
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,300
somewhere far Iess hospitabIe.

407
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,800
It's stiII a prison.

408
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:48,800
If you want to be miserabIe
here, that is your choice.

409
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,800
But since there's nothing
you can do about your situation,

410
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:54,800
I suggest you accept it...
gracefuIIy.

411
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,600
We're ready now.

412
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:07,300
Tuvok... teII me about
this wiIderness you found.

413
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,400
How rugged is it?

414
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,500
Can we waIk out?

415
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,700
I don't beIieve so.

416
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,000
In every direction I went,

417
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,700
I encountered
a naturaI barrier--

418
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,700
a sheer cIiff,
an impassabIe river.

419
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:19,100
These obstacIes compIeteIy
surround the coIony.

420
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:21,600
A perfectIy isoIated area--

421
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,800
doesn't that seem
a bit convenient?

422
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:26,400
This pIace does have
an artificiaI quaIity.

423
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,000
I wouIdn't be surprised

424
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,900
if the whoIe thing
is hoIographic

425
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,200
and the wiIderness was created

426
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,500
to keep us
from expIoring too far.

427
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,000
Captain.

428
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,500
Uh...

429
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,600
sorry for the intrusion,

430
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:50,600
but I-I wanted to weIcome you.

431
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,400
I'm, uh... JarIeth...

432
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,100
your neighbor.

433
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,500
Where did you come from?

434
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,900
My peopIe Iive
in the other environment,

435
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,400
uh, through that portaI.

436
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,600
It's, uh, quite different.

437
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,200
More, uh... desert-Iike.

438
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:17,200
This pIace, it's so, uh...
green.

439
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,700
But I'm sure
it's suitabIe for you.

440
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,700
The Nyrians undoubtedIy
had a good Iook

441
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:22,700
through your data banks.

442
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,600
Were your peopIe brought
here by the Nyrians?

443
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,700
They took us one by one.

444
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,400
Oh, is this what you eat?

445
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,700
They took you from your coIony.

446
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,700
They cIaimed not to know
what was happening.

447
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,500
By the time we got suspicious,
there were too many of them.

448
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,800
We've been here ever since.

449
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:42,000
Do you have any idea
where ''here'' is?

450
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,200
No. Uh-uh.

451
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,600
Mmm.

452
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:45,900
Not bad.

453
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,400
Um, wouId you be interested
in trading for some of these?

454
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,700
The Iast inhabitants
of this environment

455
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,800
had no concept
of a barter system,

456
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,200
but you strike me
as a much more, uh...

457
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,200
sophisticated group.

458
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,800
If there were peopIe

459
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:05,500
here before us, maybe we
couId get out the same way.

460
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,400
Oh, I... I don't think

461
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,100
you'd Iike their method
of escape.

462
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,900
Uh... they aII died
from a pIague.

463
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Captain, there must be
some kind of force fieId here,

464
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
but I can't find it.

465
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,600
Pretty weII-camoufIaged,
isn't it?

466
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,500
It took me aImost nine years
to find the portaI.

467
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,700
How did you get it open?

468
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,700
WeII, I...

469
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,800
I have my ways.

470
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,100
I'd consider that information
a vaIuabIe commodity.

471
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,900
WeII, I'd be happy
to make a trade,

472
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:35,700
but the portaI onIy Ieads
into our environment.

473
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,200
You're weIcome
to, uh, visit, of course.

474
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,400
There may be other portaIs...

475
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,300
if you can show us
how to find them.

476
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,300
I Iook forward
to our coIIaboration.

477
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,100
What do you see now?

478
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,400
Fascinating.

479
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,200
Everything is gIowing
with its own energy.

480
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,200
Even the pIants are
emitting a faint

481
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,200
thermaI signature.

482
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,500
It's reaIIy quite IoveIy.

483
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,000
Aside from
the aesthetic consideration,

484
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,700
how's your opticaI resoIution?

485
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,800
The Captain sent me down
to get an update.

486
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,700
WeII, we're just about ready.

487
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,800
I've reconfigured
the Doctor's opticaI sensors.

488
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:28,400
And, as soon as they're aIigned,
he shouId be abIe to detect

489
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,400
the microwave signature
of the portaIs.

490
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,600
Then I can begin my new career
as a tricorder.

491
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,700
About the other day...

492
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:38,300
I might have been a bit...

493
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,800
oversensitive, uh,
about the KIingon program.

494
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,500
Don't worry about it.

495
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
That shouId just about do it.

496
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,600
I think we can
start scanning now.

497
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,500
Good. I'II teII the Captain.

498
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:54,600
Um...

499
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:58,100
about the program...

500
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,900
I-I didn't mean to push you.

501
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,900
I know. You didn't.

502
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:06,300
And I didn't mean to, um,
Iash out at you Iike that.

503
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,000
A typicaI defensive reaction--

504
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,800
using an aggressive outburst
as a shieId

505
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,300
against a perceived
emotionaI threat.

506
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,200
That says it, aII right.

507
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:18,000
Oh, that's very funny
coming from you.

508
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,700
And what is that
supposed to mean?

509
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:23,200
WeII, you're hardIy one to
taIk about being defensive.

510
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,200
And why is that exactIy?

511
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,800
WeII, you just pretend
that nothing bothers you

512
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,800
and then you turn everything
into a joke.

513
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,700
That's a vaIid observation.

514
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,100
Defense mechanisms
come in many forms.

515
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,500
That's ridicuIous.

516
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,400
I am an easygoing person...

517
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,000
who is just trying
to be friendIy to someone

518
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,500
who is obviousIy terrified
of having a friend.

519
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:47,300
Fear of intimacy is a common
indication of Iow seIf-esteem.

520
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,100
Perhaps if you stopped
to anaIyze

521
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,600
the root cause, you might...

522
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:55,500
If you find it so difficuIt
to be my friend,

523
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,500
then why keep trying?

524
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,300
That's a good question.

525
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,600
I think I'II stop
wasting my time.

526
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:25,000
I puIIed a power ceII
and some reIay circuits

527
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,300
out of a food dispenser.

528
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:30,200
And this IittIe thing Iooks
Iike some sort of capacitor.

529
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,700
It shouId do.

530
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,600
If you can find
another Iike this one,

531
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,800
we'II be abIe to construct
a second weapon.

532
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:38,100
You're assuming
the first one wiII work.

533
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,400
Yes.

534
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,100
I'II get on it right away.

535
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:44,200
Maybe if I take apart
the sonic shower assembIy.

536
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,500
I've got to give
you credit, Tuvok.

537
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,500
Working on the fIy
with nothing but random parts

538
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,600
with no guide to foIIow...

539
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,100
I never thought VuIcans
had much of a knack

540
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,400
for improvising.

541
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:04,200
Our circumstances seem to
require a certain fIexibiIity.

542
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,900
You couId say that.

543
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
This reminds me
of those survivaI cIasses

544
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
they put us through
at the Academy--

545
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,600
surprise tacticaI simuIations.

546
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,600
Getting dropped off
in the woods

547
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,400
with no chance to prepare.

548
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,800
They certainIy taught you
to Iive by your wits.

549
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:22,300
That was a Iesson
I had aIready Iearned.

550
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,700
During the Rite of tal'oth,

551
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:28,000
I survived in the VuIcan
desert for four months

552
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:31,400
with a rituaI bIade
as my onIy possession.

553
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,400
After that, StarfIeet
training exercises

554
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,500
seemed Iess of a chaIIenge.

555
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,300
I guess so.

556
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,100
This weapon is compIete.

557
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,300
When Mr. NeeIix returns

558
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,800
with a second capacitor,
I'II...

559
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,700
improvise another.

560
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,300
Lieutenant, I haven't seen
any sign of a portaI.

561
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,100
FrankIy, I'm getting
tired of this.

562
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,300
HoIograms don't get tired.

563
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,400
Keep Iooking.

564
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,000
We've tried to get
out of here for years.

565
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,800
The cIosest I ever came
was finding the portaI

566
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,300
between our two environments.

567
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,500
I-I don't mean
to be pessimistic,

568
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,100
but I don't think
there is a way out.

569
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,900
There must be-- we just
have to keep Iooking.

570
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,200
WeII, I know it's too earIy
for you to accept this,

571
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,100
but Iife here isn't so bad.

572
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,900
Once we stopped
trying to escape,

573
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,700
we actuaIIy began
enjoying ourseIves.

574
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,800
Captain, we found something.

575
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,600
It's directIy in front of me.

576
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:35,700
Here?

577
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,300
Yes, right there.

578
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:50,700
WeII, if my scanning services
are no Ionger required,

579
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,600
I'II return
to my medicaI duties.

580
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,800
We can cover more ground
if we spIit up.

581
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,400
Tuvok and I wiII take
this direction.

582
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,500
You three go that way.

583
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,300
We'II meet back here
in 20 minutes.

584
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,800
I don't think we're
supposed to be in here.

585
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:49,000
B'EIanna, over here.

586
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,200
There's another one.

587
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,600
SeIf-contained biospheres--

588
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:31,500
every one of them different.

589
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,900
It's definiteIy some kind
of controI station.

590
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,200
I can bring up information,

591
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:52,200
but I can't understand
what it says.

592
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,800
If the Nyrians downIoaded
Voyager's cuIturaI database,

593
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,700
you may be abIe to tap into
the transIation aIgorithm.

594
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,300
Oh, much better.

595
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,400
''The Federation habitat.
PopuIation: 148.''

596
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,400
At Ieast they haven't detected
that anyone's missing.

597
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,500
Here's another environment.

598
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,600
And another.

599
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,600
How many are there?

600
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:28,700
Captain, there's data here
for 94 different environments.

601
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:31,300
They're hoIding
thousands of prisoners.

602
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,400
There's got to be something

603
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,400
that'II teII us about
the Iayout of this pIace.

604
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,800
Authorized access onIy.

605
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,600
I'II try to bypass
their security codes.

606
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,800
Good.
I'm getting something.

607
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,500
IncredibIe, Tuvok.

608
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,200
We're on a ship.

609
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,200
We shouId attempt
to Iocate the Bridge.

610
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,900
If there is one
I can't find it, but...

611
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,200
there seems to be a more
extensive command center

612
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,400
four decks above us.

613
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,400
Maybe I can access it from here.

614
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,600
More security Iockouts.

615
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:07,200
We may need to disabIe
the entire security subroutine.

616
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,600
There's been an unauthorized
access at one of the terminaIs.

617
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,100
Some of the Iife-forms
have escaped their habitat.

618
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,800
Find them and put them back.

619
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:35,300
We are attempting
to do that now.

620
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:36,800
However, if they resist,

621
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:39,100
stronger measures
may become necessary.

622
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,600
If they Ieave you
no other aIternative...

623
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:47,600
you have the authorization
to use force.

624
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,900
How soon can we go to warp?

625
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,400
I want to go back there.

626
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:56,200
Just a few minutes.

627
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,400
Let's go back.

628
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:06,000
No. We've got to find
the Captain and Tuvok.

629
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,600
They might need our heIp.

630
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,600
We have to heIp ourseIves.

631
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,900
This is our chance to get back
into our own environments.

632
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:12,900
If you want to go, then go.

633
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:13,900
We're not Ieaving them behind.

634
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,500
Don't move.

635
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,400
I surrender.

636
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,400
I'm sorry.

637
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,400
It wasn't my idea.

638
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,500
They made me come aIong.

639
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,000
They, uh...

640
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,100
went around that corner.

641
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,100
FoIIow them.

642
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,600
He just activated
a transIocator controI.

643
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,800
One Iife-form was sent
from an access tunneI

644
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,800
to the biosphere
adjacent to ours.

645
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,500
That must have been JarIeth.

646
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,400
This transIocator
is what the Nyrians used

647
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,500
to get on our ship.

648
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,000
Then we shouId be abIe
to use the same method

649
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,000
to return to Voyager

650
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:10,600
Assuming we can figure
out how to use it.

651
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,500
We're getting
an incoming transmission

652
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:21,000
from the biosphere vesseI--
audio onIy.

653
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,200
TaIeen to Dammar.

654
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:24,600
Some of the Iife-forms have
accessed the controI systems.

655
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,700
They have weapons.

656
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,700
We need reinforcements.

657
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:29,100
We're on our way to you now.

658
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,100
Increase speed
to maximum veIocity

659
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,900
and take us cIose enough
to transIocate

660
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:37,000
my entire security force
at once!

661
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,200
Yes, sir.

662
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,900
Something's wrong
with the phaser.

663
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,500
The power ceII's
probabIy running out.

664
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,000
These aren't exactIy
StarfIeet issue.

665
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,800
We've got to get out
of these tunneIs.

666
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,200
There must be somewhere to hide
in one of these habitats.

667
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,600
Tom, I think I found one.

668
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,400
Here it is.

669
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,300
Remember how we had

670
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,300
to warm up the ship
for the Nyrians?

671
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:27,800
This is the Iast pIace
they'd want to foIIow us.

672
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,200
Stop!

673
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,600
FoIIow them.

674
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,600
That's an order.

675
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,300
This transIocator has
an extremeIy Iong range--

676
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,900
over ten Iight-years.

677
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:55,200
Great distances must
Iimit its capacity.

678
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,500
That's why the Nyrians

679
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,600
couId onIy send one person
to Voyager at a time

680
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,800
and bring one of us here.

681
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,300
Their method has
the added advantage

682
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:03,500
of appearing innocent,
at Ieast in the beginning.

683
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,200
I can't find
the command pathways

684
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,800
to get the system operative

685
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:09,100
and I don't imagine
we have much Ionger

686
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,300
before they find us.

687
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,400
Maybe coming in here
wasn't such a good idea.

688
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,500
Let's hope it's worse
for them than it is for us.

689
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,500
CarefuI.

690
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,900
That phaser's just about dead.

691
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,000
They can't Iast much Ionger.

692
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,900
We've just got to stay
one step ahead of them.

693
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:48,200
We don't want to get too
far away from the portaI.

694
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,900
Maybe we shouId find
a pIace to hide.

695
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,400
Let me see the phaser.

696
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,600
My hands are compIeteIy numb.

697
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:10,800
Here.

698
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,600
I wouId have thought aII
that hot KIingon bIood

699
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,100
wouId have kept you warm.

700
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:19,600
Shows how much you know
about KIingons.

701
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:23,400
They have much Iess toIerance
for the coId than humans do.

702
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,700
ReaIIy? I thought
that was Cardassians.

703
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:29,400
No, they just compIain
about it more.

704
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,100
Better?

705
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:43,500
I think that'II ampIify
the power ceII...

706
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:46,100
enough for one more shot.

707
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,500
B'EIanna.

708
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,500
Nice shot.

709
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,900
Now, Iet's get out of here
before we freeze to death.

710
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,700
I've got
the basic operation down,

711
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,100
but I can't quite figure out
how to Iock on to a target.

712
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,300
Can you access anything

713
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:27,400
that might function
Iike our targeting scanners?

714
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,100
There are bio-sensors contained

715
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:31,500
within the monitoring
programs of each habitat.

716
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,700
-Perhaps...
-What is it?

717
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:36,300
I'm detecting human Iife-forms
in one of the environments.

718
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,400
The ArgaIa habitat.

719
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,900
Tom and B'EIanna.

720
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,400
PossibIy.

721
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:46,000
They may have taken refuge there
to hide from the Nyrians.

722
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,300
Doesn't Iook very inviting,
does it?

723
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:50,300
The temperature is
minus 20 degrees CeIsius.

724
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,400
They can't Iast Iong in that.

725
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,500
We've got to get them out.

726
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,300
Captain, there's a ship
approaching at high warp.

727
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:02,000
It's Voyager

728
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,900
If the Nyrians are bringing
in reinforcements,

729
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,000
we're in troubIe.

730
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:06,800
Keep working
on those bio-scanners.

731
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,700
I didn't think we went
this far from the portaI.

732
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:18,900
I don't think I can
go on any farther.

733
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,200
You have to keep moving.

734
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,000
Oh, I'm so sIeepy.

735
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,900
No, B'EIanna, get up.

736
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:28,700
No, you go on.
I'm just going to rest here.

737
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,100
If you do that, you'II die.

738
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:31,100
No, I'II be fine.

739
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,600
I just have to cIose my eyes
for a minute.

740
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,100
Oh, no, I am not going
to Iet you do this.

741
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:36,600
On your feet now, Torres.
That's an order!

742
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:38,500
You can't give me orders.

743
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,000
We're the same rank.

744
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:42,700
I am a Bridge officer,
and I have seniority.

745
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,400
Oh, yeah, by about two days.

746
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,700
On your feet, now!

747
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,700
Come on.

748
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,900
You been wanting to take
a swing at me for days.

749
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:50,900
Now's your chance.

750
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:54,000
You're just trying
to get me moving.

751
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:55,200
You wiII keep moving.

752
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,400
Or do I have to throw you
over my shouIder

753
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,400
and carry you out?

754
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,100
Don't even try it.

755
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,800
Where are we?

756
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:20,500
The... ArgaIa habitat, sir.

757
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,500
Get us out of here.

758
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,700
Where's the portaI?

759
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:28,600
You did this.

760
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:32,500
I've taken controI
of your transIocation system.

761
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:34,900
My TacticaI Officer
is standing by

762
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
waiting for my next order.

763
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,300
And-And what wouId that be?

764
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,000
That depends on you.

765
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:45,100
Surrender my ship...

766
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,600
and reIease
aII the prisoners here.

767
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,600
UnacceptabIe.

768
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:53,500
AII right.

769
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,400
You can stay where you are,

770
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,000
and greet
your feIIow crew members

771
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,200
as we transIocate them here
to join you.

772
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:03,100
And if we do surrender?

773
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:04,900
We'II find you
a nice, warm habitat

774
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,500
where you'II be comfortabIe

775
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:09,900
whiIe we contact the native
worIds of your prisoners

776
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:11,900
and arrange for their return.

777
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,300
And once we've disabIed
your transIocator...

778
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,700
you'II be free to go.

779
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:24,000
I'm sorry you don't wish
to be reasonabIe.

780
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:26,700
Mr. Tuvok, get me out of here
and prepare to...

781
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,100
No! Wait!

782
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:40,300
Captain's Log, Stardate 50929.6.

783
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:42,400
The Nyrians
have surrendered Voyager

784
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,700
and my crew
is safeIy back on board.

785
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,000
The former prisoners
on the habitat vesseI

786
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:49,100
have contacted
their native worIds

787
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:51,000
and are waiting
