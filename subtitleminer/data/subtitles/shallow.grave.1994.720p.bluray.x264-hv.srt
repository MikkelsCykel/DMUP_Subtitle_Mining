1
00:00:22,156 --> 00:00:25,827
I'm not ashamed. I've known love.

2
00:00:26,077 --> 00:00:28,371
I've known rejection.

3
00:00:28,621 --> 00:00:31,291
I'm not afraid to declare my feelings.

4
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:37,338
Take trust, for instance, or friendship.
These are the important things in life.

5
00:00:37,589 --> 00:00:41,968
These are the things that matter,
that help you on your way.

6
00:00:42,218 --> 00:00:48,683
If you can't trust your friends,
well what then? What then?

7
00:00:50,351 --> 00:00:52,520
This could have been any city.

8
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,983
They're all the same.

9
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:25,905
Hello. I've come about the room.

10
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:36,374
- So what's his name?
- I don't know. Campbell or something.

11
00:02:36,624 --> 00:02:39,419
- Cameron.
- Cameron? Really?

12
00:02:39,669 --> 00:02:41,963
That's right.

13
00:02:42,213 --> 00:02:44,674
What?

14
00:02:44,924 --> 00:02:47,176
- Are you comfortable?
- Yes, thanks.

15
00:02:47,427 --> 00:02:49,470
- Have you seen the flat?
- Yes.

16
00:02:49,721 --> 00:02:52,432
- And you like it?
- Yes, it's great.

17
00:02:52,682 --> 00:02:55,476
We all like it. The room's nice,
too, don't you think?

18
00:02:55,727 --> 00:02:59,522
Spacious, bright, all that sort of stuff,
all that sort of crap.

19
00:02:59,772 --> 00:03:01,232
Well, yes.

20
00:03:01,482 --> 00:03:04,903
So tell me, cos I'd like to know,
what on earth could make you think...

21
00:03:05,153 --> 00:03:07,822
.. we'd want to share this flat
with someone like you?

22
00:03:08,072 --> 00:03:13,036
My first impression is that you have none
of the qualities we seek from a flatmate.

23
00:03:13,286 --> 00:03:16,831
I'm talking about things like presence,
charisma, style and charm.

24
00:03:17,081 --> 00:03:20,418
I don't think we're asking too much,
or being unreasonable.

25
00:03:20,668 --> 00:03:24,589
Take David here. An accountant
he may be, but at least he tries hard.

26
00:03:24,839 --> 00:03:27,926
Trouble is, I just don't think you're trying.

27
00:03:28,176 --> 00:03:33,056
Hey, Cameron, I mean this. Good luck.

28
00:03:42,607 --> 00:03:45,151
- Just a few questions.
- What about your hobbies?

29
00:03:45,401 --> 00:03:47,403
- Why do you want a room here?
- Do you smoke?

30
00:03:47,654 --> 00:03:51,449
When you sacrifice a goat and rip
its heart out, do you summon hellfire?

31
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:55,620
It's a straightforward question.
Either you're divorced or you're not.

32
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:59,499
- Or do you just send out for a pizza?
- Do a little freebase, maybe?

33
00:03:59,749 --> 00:04:02,335
How do you decide
which shade of black to wear?

34
00:04:02,585 --> 00:04:05,838
OK, I'm going to play you
just a few seconds of this tape.

35
00:04:06,089 --> 00:04:08,424
Name the song, the lead singer,...

36
00:04:08,675 --> 00:04:16,140
...and three hit singles subsequently
recorded by him with another band.

37
00:04:23,022 --> 00:04:27,068
Let me get this straight.
This affair that you're "not" having,...

38
00:04:27,318 --> 00:04:29,612
.. is it not with a man
or not with a woman?

39
00:04:29,862 --> 00:04:32,323
Turning very briefly
to corporate financing...

40
00:04:32,574 --> 00:04:36,869
No, this is important. Leveraged buyouts:
a good or a bad thing?

41
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,747
When did anyone last
say to you these exact words:

42
00:04:39,998 --> 00:04:43,793
"You are the sunshine of my life"?

43
00:04:45,086 --> 00:04:49,591
And how would you react, then,
if I told you I was the Antichrist?

44
00:04:53,511 --> 00:04:57,181
Do you like my picture?

45
00:05:07,025 --> 00:05:09,569
Defeat. Defeat. Defeat.

46
00:05:09,819 --> 00:05:16,242
Sporting, personal, financial,
professional, sexual and everything.

47
00:05:16,743 --> 00:05:20,330
Next.

48
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:28,463
- Did you know that...?
- Alex. Just serve.

49
00:05:30,423 --> 00:05:35,345
Anyway, I wasn't tryin' to win. I
don't want to devalue your victory, Juliet.

50
00:05:35,595 --> 00:05:38,723
- I wasn't tryin' to win.
- Victory's the same as defeat.

51
00:05:38,973 --> 00:05:40,892
It's giving in to destructive urges.

52
00:05:41,142 --> 00:05:43,853
Did you learn that in
your psychotherapy group?

53
00:05:44,103 --> 00:05:47,065
- Discussion group.
- I thought you'd stopped going.

54
00:05:47,315 --> 00:05:51,903
He had too many of those urges.
You of all people should know about that.

55
00:05:52,153 --> 00:05:54,364
God, you two are sensitive.

56
00:05:54,614 --> 00:05:58,534
All I'm doing is implying some
kind of ugly, sordid, sexual liaison.

57
00:05:58,785 --> 00:06:01,371
- I'd be proud of that.
- Maybe you should go.

58
00:06:01,621 --> 00:06:04,207
- You'll meet someone wonderful.
- For my life?

59
00:06:04,457 --> 00:06:07,710
- A discussion group? I think not.
- For the flat.

60
00:06:07,961 --> 00:06:11,714
No, it'd be someone like him,
and one's enough, thank you very much.

61
00:06:11,965 --> 00:06:16,010
What about that girl? That friend of yours,
the one that came round. I liked her.

62
00:06:16,261 --> 00:06:19,597
We had something. She could have
moved in. We had chemistry.

63
00:06:19,847 --> 00:06:21,766
- She hated you...
- She had problems.

64
00:06:22,016 --> 00:06:26,646
.. more than anyone
she had ever met in her entire life.

65
00:06:26,896 --> 00:06:30,483
Like they say, you know, she's
got to want to change, hasn't she?

66
00:06:40,994 --> 00:06:44,455
- You must be Hugo.
- And you must be Juliet.

67
00:06:44,706 --> 00:06:49,627
- Would you like to come in?
- I'd be delighted.

68
00:06:54,924 --> 00:06:58,261
- What do you do?
- I've been away for a while.

69
00:06:58,511 --> 00:07:01,389
Travelling. And now I'm writing a novel.

70
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:02,515
Oh.

71
00:07:02,765 --> 00:07:07,562
- What's it about?
- It's actually about a priest who dies.

72
00:07:07,812 --> 00:07:09,772
I see.

73
00:07:10,023 --> 00:07:13,359
Maybe you're right. Maybe
I ought to change it. You're right.

74
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:16,946
I mean, who wants to read
another story about a dead priest?

75
00:07:17,196 --> 00:07:21,409
In fact, it's about another guy,
he's not a priest, and he lives.

76
00:07:21,659 --> 00:07:25,413
He doesn't die. See? It's better already.

77
00:07:25,663 --> 00:07:28,625
- Writing seems easy.
- It's a breeze. No problem.

78
00:07:38,218 --> 00:07:41,679
Do you think you could answer that?

79
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:47,227
- What, the telephone?
- But... if it's for me, I'm not here.

80
00:07:47,477 --> 00:07:51,522
Right. You're not here.

81
00:07:52,774 --> 00:07:56,361
OK.

82
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:03,868
Hello?

83
00:08:04,118 --> 00:08:08,748
Yes, it is, yes. Who's calling, please?

84
00:08:09,165 --> 00:08:14,420
Well, I'm sorry, but she's not...
she's not in right now.

85
00:08:14,587 --> 00:08:18,216
No, I've got absolutely no idea.

86
00:08:18,466 --> 00:08:21,219
Would you like to leave a message?

87
00:08:21,469 --> 00:08:25,056
OK. Goodbye.

88
00:08:27,225 --> 00:08:30,270
That was, um... a guy called Brian.

89
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,314
- Did he sound upset?
- A little bit, yeah.

90
00:08:33,565 --> 00:08:36,276
- Is that good or bad?
- It's an improvement.

91
00:08:36,526 --> 00:08:38,987
Shall I get the phone?

92
00:08:39,237 --> 00:08:43,157
Just leave it. He knows I'm probably
at home. I'm working nights this week.

93
00:08:43,408 --> 00:08:46,119
- You're working nights?
- I'm a doctor.

94
00:08:46,369 --> 00:08:47,120
Ah.

95
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:52,166
- And he's a patient?
- No, but he needs treatment.

96
00:08:52,417 --> 00:08:54,752
- For what?
- A certain weakness.

97
00:08:55,003 --> 00:08:58,631
- The human condition.
- Oh. You know about it.

98
00:08:58,881 --> 00:09:03,595
- Well, I write about it.
- And that's not the same thing?

99
00:09:03,845 --> 00:09:07,515
No. I'm like all novelists -
on a search of the self.

100
00:09:07,765 --> 00:09:10,268
Has he tried
down the back of the fridge?

101
00:09:10,518 --> 00:09:12,687
He seemed like a nice guy, Alex.

102
00:09:12,937 --> 00:09:15,732
I'm not saying
he didn't seem like a nice guy.

103
00:09:15,982 --> 00:09:19,569
I just said it's a bit strange,
this search of the self or whatever.

104
00:09:19,819 --> 00:09:22,196
He didn't seem strange, Alex.

105
00:09:22,447 --> 00:09:27,869
He seemed... you know,...

106
00:09:28,119 --> 00:09:32,081
...interesting.
- Interesting?

107
00:09:36,711 --> 00:09:40,298
Interesting.

108
00:09:45,261 --> 00:09:48,598
Hello? No, she's not in.

109
00:09:48,848 --> 00:09:51,351
I don't know. I've no idea.

110
00:09:51,601 --> 00:09:54,020
- Who was it?
- I don't know. He sounded Swedish.

111
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:57,607
- Do you know any Swedish men?
- No.

112
00:09:57,857 --> 00:09:59,984
Maybe it was just the emotion.

113
00:10:00,235 --> 00:10:02,487
- What do you think?
- About what?

114
00:10:02,737 --> 00:10:05,281
- About this Hugo person.
- I don't have the time.

115
00:10:05,531 --> 00:10:09,285
- I'm just asking what you think.
- I don't care, so long as he's not a freak.

116
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:12,956
David. It's your mother's
handwriting. I didn't open it.

117
00:10:13,206 --> 00:10:16,709
I don't like reading about
your father's constipation.

118
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,879
- So we'll meet him, then?
- What?

119
00:10:20,129 --> 00:10:25,510
Yeah, yeah, whatever. I tell you, every
letter this guy writes you is the same.

120
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,138
They all begin like true love
and descend into open pornography.

121
00:10:29,389 --> 00:10:33,351
"I dream of your thighs, the touch of
your white skin leading me in desire,...

122
00:10:33,601 --> 00:10:39,607
.. while I, aroused and inflamed... "
Aroused and inflamed?

123
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:46,406
He even signs them in his own name.

124
00:10:46,656 --> 00:10:51,786
I'd sign someone else's. I'd sign his name.
If I wrote them, that is, which I don't.

125
00:10:52,036 --> 00:10:54,414
Interesting. That's what she said.

126
00:10:54,664 --> 00:10:57,125
Interesting. You see,
that's why you're here.

127
00:10:57,375 --> 00:11:00,378
I don't usually meet people,
unless I already know them.

128
00:11:00,628 --> 00:11:03,047
- I see.
- People can be so cruel.

129
00:11:03,298 --> 00:11:05,508
So, um...

130
00:11:05,758 --> 00:11:08,720
.. well, we think it's fine.

131
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:11,055
Ah. So, I can have the room?

132
00:11:11,306 --> 00:11:14,434
- Yes, you can have the room.
- I'm not usually drunk.

133
00:11:14,684 --> 00:11:17,896
- Not usually this drunk.
- Only on expenses.

134
00:11:18,146 --> 00:11:20,815
He's going to tell you
he could have been someone.

135
00:11:21,065 --> 00:11:24,777
Instead of what he is, which is
the man we know and love.

136
00:11:25,028 --> 00:11:29,115
.. tired out, empty shell of a...
Know and love?

137
00:11:29,365 --> 00:11:32,243
- I think you're lying.
- You're right.

138
00:11:32,493 --> 00:11:39,083
- You see? They don't really know me.
- No, Alex. We don't really love you.

139
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,087
Can you afford this place?

140
00:11:43,338 --> 00:11:46,925
Oh, yeah.

141
00:11:50,345 --> 00:11:55,183
- Can I ask you a question?
- Certainly.

142
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:59,812
Have you ever killed a man?

143
00:12:05,526 --> 00:12:07,987
No.

144
00:12:12,075 --> 00:12:15,328
That's fair enough, then.

145
00:12:23,086 --> 00:12:28,591
Well, it certainly smells like the real thing.

146
00:13:35,867 --> 00:13:38,870
Rangers have made a few
dramatic comebacks this season.

147
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:45,168
But they'll really have to
draw on all of their resources.

148
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:51,424
- Have you seen Hugo?
- No.

149
00:13:51,674 --> 00:13:54,302
Any idea which channel he's on?

150
00:13:54,552 --> 00:13:57,847
.. the High Court in Edinburgh.

151
00:13:58,097 --> 00:14:00,850
Oh, for fuck's sake.

152
00:14:07,482 --> 00:14:11,569
No, she's not in.

153
00:14:19,869 --> 00:14:22,497
- Have you seen him?
- I don't have the time.

154
00:14:22,747 --> 00:14:27,377
- Yes or no? David, yes or...?
- No!

155
00:14:29,629 --> 00:14:32,048
- David hasn't seen him either.
- So I gathered.

156
00:14:32,298 --> 00:14:33,967
- Maybe he didn't like us.
- David?

157
00:14:34,217 --> 00:14:37,595
- No, Hugo.
- His car's still there.

158
00:14:37,845 --> 00:14:41,140
- He's got a car?
- Yeah. What's wrong with that?

159
00:14:41,391 --> 00:14:44,185
- What sort of car?
- I don't know, Alex. I'm just a girl.

160
00:14:44,435 --> 00:14:46,563
I'll ask you once more. What sort of car?

161
00:14:46,813 --> 00:14:51,526
A blue one, OK? And it's still there.

162
00:15:04,789 --> 00:15:08,042
Hugo, I'm sorry about this,
but can you open your door?

163
00:15:08,293 --> 00:15:13,881
It's us, your flatmates and companions,
your new-found friends.

164
00:15:14,591 --> 00:15:17,886
- He's not there. I can't see him at all.
- Maybe he's in the wardrobe.

165
00:15:18,136 --> 00:15:20,305
Of course he's not
in the bloody wardrobe.

166
00:15:20,555 --> 00:15:23,892
- It's a joke, Alex.
- I think he probably left.

167
00:15:24,142 --> 00:15:29,230
- We'll probably never see him again.
- Alex, the key is on the other side.

168
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,108
- So?
- Open it.

169
00:15:32,358 --> 00:15:34,277
You want me to kick this in? Now?

170
00:15:34,527 --> 00:15:38,323
- Yeah.
- OK, no problem.

171
00:15:45,788 --> 00:15:49,792
Do you want a go?

172
00:15:50,752 --> 00:15:54,756
OK, you size that up.

173
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:22,992
- Is this what they always look like?
- Yes.

174
00:16:23,576 --> 00:16:26,537
- Wonder how he did it.
- Did what?

175
00:16:26,788 --> 00:16:31,793
Killed himself.
I presume that's what's happened.

176
00:16:32,043 --> 00:16:33,962
What do you think?

177
00:16:34,212 --> 00:16:36,798
- Alex!
- What? What's wrong?

178
00:16:37,048 --> 00:16:38,883
- What are you doing?
- Looking.

179
00:16:39,133 --> 00:16:40,718
- Don't.
- Don't look?

180
00:16:40,969 --> 00:16:43,012
- No.
- Why not?

181
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:45,807
What's wrong? Don't you
wonder what he died from?

182
00:16:46,057 --> 00:16:50,770
No. The guy's dead.
What more do you need?

183
00:16:51,771 --> 00:16:54,691
It's not every day
I find a story in my own flat.

184
00:16:54,941 --> 00:16:59,779
It's not a story, Alex, it's a corpse.

185
00:17:01,906 --> 00:17:06,160
I've never seen a dead body before.

186
00:17:14,544 --> 00:17:18,089
I saw my grandmother, of course,
but I don't suppose that counts.

187
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:22,010
She was alive at the time.

188
00:17:37,358 --> 00:17:41,946
Can I show you something?

189
00:17:51,497 --> 00:17:55,084
Emergency. Which service?

190
00:17:55,335 --> 00:17:58,796
Emergency. Which...?

191
00:18:03,134 --> 00:18:05,345
- No.
- Just think about it.

192
00:18:05,595 --> 00:18:07,680
- No.
- Come on, David.

193
00:18:07,931 --> 00:18:10,183
- No.
- Juliet?

194
00:18:10,433 --> 00:18:13,311
- No, Alex. It's...
- It's what?

195
00:18:13,561 --> 00:18:15,271
- Unfeasible.
- Is that all?

196
00:18:15,521 --> 00:18:17,774
- You mean immoral.
- I know what I mean.

197
00:18:18,024 --> 00:18:22,362
- I'm only asking you to think about it.
- It's a sick idea, Alex. It's sick.

198
00:18:22,612 --> 00:18:26,282
But don't tell me you're not tempted.
Don't tell me you're not interested.

199
00:18:26,532 --> 00:18:30,411
- I know you well enough.
- You think so?

200
00:18:36,167 --> 00:18:39,295
Go ahead, then. Telephone.

201
00:18:39,545 --> 00:18:43,466
Telephone the police.

202
00:18:43,549 --> 00:18:46,010
Go ahead. No one's gonna
stand in your way.

203
00:18:46,261 --> 00:18:48,346
Telephone them. Tell them.

204
00:18:48,596 --> 00:18:55,103
Tell them there's a suitcase full
of money, and you don't want it.

205
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:24,549
# My baby don't care for shows

206
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:29,596
# My baby don't care for clothes

207
00:19:29,804 --> 00:19:34,893
# My baby just cares for me

208
00:19:36,853 --> 00:19:41,024
# My baby don't care for

209
00:19:41,566 --> 00:19:44,819
# Cars and races

210
00:19:45,069 --> 00:19:48,948
# My baby don't care for

211
00:19:50,366 --> 00:19:53,161
# High-tone places

212
00:19:53,411 --> 00:19:57,707
# Liz Taylor is not his style

213
00:19:57,957 --> 00:20:00,585
Was there a pet
in the house? Yeah, a pet.

214
00:20:00,835 --> 00:20:05,089
You know, like a dog or a budgie
or a gerbil or something?

215
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:12,096
What I need here is "PC Plod saves Harry
the Hamster from house of horror".

216
00:20:13,431 --> 00:20:17,477
All right. Well, that's a pity.
You see, no pets - no human angle.

217
00:20:17,727 --> 00:20:23,858
# My baby just cares for me

218
00:20:29,572 --> 00:20:33,618
- Hi, there. What happened to that guy?
- What guy?

219
00:20:33,868 --> 00:20:35,828
That guy. The one that died.

220
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:37,705
- Died?
- That one last week.

221
00:20:37,956 --> 00:20:40,583
- Here?
- Yes, here. Where else?

222
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:43,711
Oh, him. Well, he died.

223
00:20:43,962 --> 00:20:45,630
That's what I thought.

224
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:50,802
Hello? Have you got room
for an overnighter?

225
00:20:58,017 --> 00:21:02,605
# My baby don't care

226
00:21:02,855 --> 00:21:05,900
# For cars and races

227
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:09,988
# Baby don't care for

228
00:21:10,238 --> 00:21:13,116
# He don't care for high-tone places

229
00:21:13,366 --> 00:21:18,705
# And Liz Taylor is not his style

230
00:21:18,955 --> 00:21:22,792
- He's still here?
- Yeah, he couldn't get his car started.

231
00:21:23,042 --> 00:21:25,169
When are you gonna let the police know?

232
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:28,464
You phone them if you want, David.

233
00:21:28,715 --> 00:21:34,095
- What about you?
- I'm getting used to having him around.

234
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:38,808
# With baby

235
00:21:39,058 --> 00:21:42,562
# My baby just cares for

236
00:21:42,812 --> 00:21:46,649
# My baby just cares for

237
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:52,864
# My baby just cares for me #

238
00:21:55,867 --> 00:21:58,202
What is it we do here, David?

239
00:21:58,453 --> 00:22:00,204
- Sorry?
- Here.

240
00:22:00,455 --> 00:22:03,875
- Right here?
- In this firm.

241
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:07,754
- Well, it's a wide range of...
- Accounting, David.

242
00:22:08,004 --> 00:22:12,926
Chartered accounting is of ten sneered at.
Were you aware of that?

243
00:22:13,176 --> 00:22:17,096
- Not any real sneering as such, no.
- There's a whole wide world out there,...

244
00:22:17,347 --> 00:22:20,350
.. and it all needs to be
accounted for, does it not?

245
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,144
- Well, I...
- They sneer, do they not?

246
00:22:23,394 --> 00:22:25,563
- I'm not sure.
- It's unfashionable.

247
00:22:25,813 --> 00:22:29,234
But yes, we're methodical,
yes, we're diligent, yes, we're serious.

248
00:22:29,484 --> 00:22:33,029
And where's the crime in that?
Why not shout it from the rooftops?

249
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:37,742
Maybe sometimes we're a wee bit boring,
but, by God, we get the job done.

250
00:22:37,992 --> 00:22:42,580
- Yes, sir.
- That's why I think you fit in here.

251
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:46,000
- I'm boring?
- You get the job done.

252
00:22:46,251 --> 00:22:53,007
- I see. I thought you meant...
- Which is why I trust you with this client.

253
00:23:22,954 --> 00:23:25,832
Good morning. Can I help you?

254
00:23:26,082 --> 00:23:29,961
Yeah, I'll just check that for you.

255
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,319
Let's do it.

256
00:23:54,569 --> 00:23:58,323
Let's talk about disposal.
We have to make that body unidentifiable.

257
00:23:58,573 --> 00:24:01,868
Burning, dumping at sea
and burial are all flawed,...

258
00:24:02,118 --> 00:24:05,872
.. either by fingerprints or more commonly
by dental records, I have learnt.

259
00:24:06,122 --> 00:24:08,750
What I suggest is that
we bury him out in the forest.

260
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,337
First we remove his hands
and his feet, which we incinerate.

261
00:24:12,587 --> 00:24:16,466
And his teeth, which we just
remove. It's as simple as that.

262
00:24:16,716 --> 00:24:19,260
David.

263
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:23,890
I've always wondered
what these were for. Now...

264
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:25,642
Oh.

265
00:24:25,892 --> 00:24:28,228
This is what we need.

266
00:24:28,478 --> 00:24:30,813
And, um...

267
00:24:31,064 --> 00:24:33,191
.. this.

268
00:24:33,441 --> 00:24:34,901
- What else?
- I don't know.

269
00:24:35,151 --> 00:24:36,778
A spade. We need a spade.

270
00:24:37,028 --> 00:24:39,781
I wish you'd concentrate.
We need a spade to dig a pit.

271
00:24:40,031 --> 00:24:41,783
- Who's gonna do it?
- Dig the pit?

272
00:24:42,033 --> 00:24:43,910
- Not that.
- Who's gonna do what?

273
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:48,081
- You know what I'm talking about.
- Do I? What are you talking about?

274
00:24:48,331 --> 00:24:51,417
- You know what. Who's gonna do it?
- We all are, David.

275
00:24:51,668 --> 00:24:55,797
We're all gonna do it. You, me and Juliet
will do his or her bit. Fair enough?

276
00:24:56,047 --> 00:24:58,049
- I can't do it.
- I don't hear this.

277
00:24:58,299 --> 00:25:01,469
- I won't be able to do it.
- You want out already?

278
00:25:01,719 --> 00:25:04,722
You don't want the money?
Hugo is going off! He smells!

279
00:25:04,973 --> 00:25:11,521
- The flat smells! We can't wait!
- I won't be able to cut him up.

280
00:25:25,785 --> 00:25:29,455
- Who's going to do it?
- I thought we all were.

281
00:25:29,706 --> 00:25:32,750
- I don't think I can.
- But, Juliet, you're a doctor.

282
00:25:33,001 --> 00:25:38,131
- You kill people every day.
- That's different. I still don't want to.

283
00:25:38,381 --> 00:25:42,385
Now you tell me.

284
00:26:03,573 --> 00:26:05,491
There's something I want to ask.

285
00:26:05,742 --> 00:26:10,204
I don't know! I swear to God, I don't know!

286
00:26:11,748 --> 00:26:14,000
Family? Friends?

287
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:18,421
Drugged-up, wandering, suicidal
fuck-ups don't have families.

288
00:26:18,671 --> 00:26:23,468
- I just thought we should discuss it.
- Take his legs.

289
00:26:26,971 --> 00:26:30,558
Where's Hugo?

290
00:27:20,066 --> 00:27:23,403
- Pick him up.
- Shh.

291
00:27:23,653 --> 00:27:27,699
- Pick him up.
- Shh.

292
00:27:29,409 --> 00:27:33,871
I swear to God, I don't know! I don't know!

293
00:28:24,672 --> 00:28:27,091
Stupid fuckin' bastard.

294
00:28:35,683 --> 00:28:37,810
Why don't we draw lots for it?

295
00:28:38,061 --> 00:28:42,315
Whoever draws the short straw does it all.
That way you either do it or you don't.

296
00:28:42,565 --> 00:28:44,943
- OK. I can go with that.
- David?

297
00:28:45,193 --> 00:28:48,863
- I don't know.
- If I draw the short straw, I'll do it.

298
00:28:49,113 --> 00:28:54,744
But I'm not gonna do it
just because you won't.

299
00:29:33,533 --> 00:29:36,953
All right, then. Here we are and this is it.

300
00:29:37,203 --> 00:29:41,457
Do you wanna play or not?

301
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:21,164
I can't do it.

302
00:31:01,454 --> 00:31:06,084
- Finished.
- All right, but not quite.

303
00:31:06,459 --> 00:31:09,087
- Is that going to be deep enough?
- Don't worry.

304
00:31:09,337 --> 00:31:14,884
- Is this necessary?
- Yes. Now come on. All or nothin'.

305
00:32:01,014 --> 00:32:05,268
- Are you all right?
- Oh, yes. I'm fine, thanks. Just fine.

306
00:32:05,518 --> 00:32:09,731
- Would you like to talk about it?
- No.

307
00:32:28,333 --> 00:32:33,254
These three people
get their chance to...

308
00:32:33,504 --> 00:32:37,508
.. lose a million.

309
00:32:56,861 --> 00:33:01,616
Yes, all right. Hello there and welcome
aboard our millionaire's yacht.

310
00:33:01,866 --> 00:33:05,745
It's just like the "Marie Celeste"
but without the party atmosphere.

311
00:33:05,995 --> 00:33:09,916
As you know, the object is not
to win the game, but to...

312
00:33:10,166 --> 00:33:11,793
Lose.

313
00:33:12,043 --> 00:33:14,462
Not to give right answers, but...

314
00:33:14,712 --> 00:33:17,757
- Wrong ones.
- Not to do well, but to do really...

315
00:33:18,007 --> 00:33:20,093
Badly.

316
00:33:20,343 --> 00:33:25,640
And above all to try
and make a total... hotchpotch.

317
00:33:33,314 --> 00:33:36,901
Be careful.

318
00:33:54,544 --> 00:33:57,880
Alex!

319
00:34:03,636 --> 00:34:07,181
I don't know why we couldn't
stuff it under the floorboards.

320
00:34:07,432 --> 00:34:13,271
- Stop nagging, Alex.
- We could have hid it in the fridge.

321
00:35:28,137 --> 00:35:33,142
Ladies and gentlemen,
could I have your attention, please?

322
00:35:33,393 --> 00:35:35,895
I'd like to thank you all
for coming tonight,...

323
00:35:36,145 --> 00:35:41,651
.. to help us raise funds
for the sick children's unit.

324
00:35:41,985 --> 00:35:44,946
You never told me this was for children.
I hate children.

325
00:35:45,196 --> 00:35:51,703
I'd raise money to have the little fuckers
put down. I want my money back!

326
00:35:52,036 --> 00:35:54,080
But before the dancing starts...

327
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:57,333
- Excuse me!
- .. I would like to give a vote of thanks...

328
00:35:57,584 --> 00:36:03,631
.. to the few people who have worked
so hard to make this occasion happen.

329
00:36:03,881 --> 00:36:06,551
- Do you know these people?
- They're my friends.

330
00:36:06,801 --> 00:36:11,055
Oh, so if they want to speak to you,
we tell them that you're not here?

331
00:36:11,306 --> 00:36:18,563
But ladies and gentlemen and those
of you who are neither or both...

332
00:36:18,605 --> 00:36:24,360
- Where did they dig him up?
- Form sets for "Strip the Willow".

333
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:31,492
- Are we going to dance?
- Well, it's physical contact, isn't it?

334
00:37:46,401 --> 00:37:49,946
OK.

335
00:37:49,988 --> 00:37:51,906
Talk to me.

336
00:37:52,156 --> 00:37:53,908
Talk to me.

337
00:37:57,787 --> 00:38:03,084
- OK.
- No! Don't! Please don't!

338
00:38:06,421 --> 00:38:08,590
No! No!

339
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:12,427
Please!

340
00:38:27,358 --> 00:38:30,069
- Can we talk about something?
- Not now. I have an idea.

341
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:36,367
- It's important. We need to decide...
- Will you just stop worrying?

342
00:38:37,702 --> 00:38:40,830
To love and to happiness for ever.

343
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:44,876
For ever and ever.

344
00:38:48,671 --> 00:38:50,673
- What's wrong?
- I want to talk now.

345
00:38:50,924 --> 00:38:52,926
When you've drunk
to love and happiness.

346
00:38:53,176 --> 00:38:54,177
- Now.
- After.

347
00:38:54,427 --> 00:38:56,846
David, I promise we will.
Just keep him happy.

348
00:38:57,096 --> 00:39:02,393
It's not for me. It's for love
and happiness for ever.

349
00:39:07,941 --> 00:39:10,193
Look over there. It's Cameron.

350
00:39:10,443 --> 00:39:12,237
- Who?
- You remember Cameron.

351
00:39:12,487 --> 00:39:13,947
- No.
- What's he doing here?

352
00:39:14,197 --> 00:39:16,532
- That's not him.
- It is. Cameron!

353
00:39:16,783 --> 00:39:20,912
Cameron, come on over here. Come on.

354
00:39:21,871 --> 00:39:24,582
What?

355
00:39:24,832 --> 00:39:28,211
Nothing. We thought
you were someone else.

356
00:39:28,461 --> 00:39:30,755
Good luck!

357
00:39:31,005 --> 00:39:34,968
- Why does he have to follow us around?
- What I was wanting to say was this.

358
00:39:35,218 --> 00:39:36,219
Aha!

359
00:39:36,469 --> 00:39:39,806
- The divine Juliet. Long time no see.
- Brian.

360
00:39:40,056 --> 00:39:42,976
- Would you care to dance?
- Hold on. Who do you think you are?

361
00:39:43,226 --> 00:39:45,061
- What?
- Who do you think you are?

362
00:39:45,311 --> 00:39:49,566
- You interrupted us.
- I'm Brian Mckinley. And who are you?

363
00:39:49,816 --> 00:39:55,280
Well, Brian Mckinley, if you wanna talk
to my girlfriend, you talk to me first.

364
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:58,408
If you wanna dance, you apply
three weeks in advance,...

365
00:39:58,658 --> 00:40:01,119
.. or you're gonna end up
inside a fucking bin bag!

366
00:40:01,369 --> 00:40:05,999
You didn't apply, so you don't dance.

367
00:40:11,379 --> 00:40:14,257
Do you think you could be
a little more forceful next time?

368
00:40:14,507 --> 00:40:18,720
- I'm sorry.
- No, no. I think he got the message.

369
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:20,972
That was quite stressful.

370
00:40:21,222 --> 00:40:25,560
Yeah, but you were good. He was
really good. Fuckin' bin bag, I like that.

371
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:29,647
You really explored
your maleness to the full there.

372
00:40:29,898 --> 00:40:32,442
- You think so?
- You certainly had a good look around.

373
00:40:32,692 --> 00:40:36,279
You were magnificent.

374
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,198
Yeah.

375
00:40:39,449 --> 00:40:43,036
Fuckin' bin bag.

376
00:41:05,683 --> 00:41:09,270
Fuckin' bin bag.

377
00:41:14,025 --> 00:41:17,779
Cameron! What a surprise!

378
00:42:08,746 --> 00:42:12,041
Hello?

379
00:42:12,292 --> 00:42:15,712
Hello?

380
00:42:22,176 --> 00:42:25,013
- Who was it?
- I don't know.

381
00:42:25,263 --> 00:42:29,851
- No one said anything.
- Or rendered speechless with desire.

382
00:42:30,101 --> 00:42:33,813
I recall that feeling from
the days when I had such a thing.

383
00:42:34,063 --> 00:42:38,067
- Are you all right?
- No.

384
00:42:39,569 --> 00:42:43,781
Then let's spend some money.

385
00:42:44,782 --> 00:42:49,078
Hello. It's been a struggle,
but now our days of worry are over.

386
00:42:49,329 --> 00:42:52,999
The light at the end of the tunnel
has expanded into a golden sunrise.

387
00:42:53,249 --> 00:43:00,465
And now at last, at long last,
nothing will ever be the same again.

388
00:43:46,761 --> 00:43:50,056
This is Alex Law reporting on
the video diary of his own life.

389
00:43:50,306 --> 00:43:52,850
Let me tell you, I'm so happy I could die.

390
00:44:02,110 --> 00:44:05,071
I think we ought to stop this, don't you?

391
00:44:05,321 --> 00:44:08,408
- Oh, will you relax?
- You're making us all nervous.

392
00:44:08,658 --> 00:44:11,786
- How much did you pay for this?
- I don't know.

393
00:44:12,036 --> 00:44:14,247
- I can't remember.
- Tell me how much you paid.

394
00:44:14,497 --> 00:44:17,208
- I can't remember.
- How much did you pay for this?

395
00:44:17,458 --> 00:44:21,004
- No idea. I don't know.
- How much did you pay for this?!

396
00:44:21,254 --> 00:44:25,174
- £500.
- £500?

397
00:44:25,425 --> 00:44:28,720
You paid £500 for this?

398
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:32,390
- That's what it cost.
- No. That's what you paid for it.

399
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:38,021
£500 is what you paid for it.
We don't know how much it cost us yet.

400
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:43,443
For you two to have a good time.
We don't know the cost of that yet.

401
00:45:25,526 --> 00:45:29,656
Excuse me. Did they take anything?

402
00:45:37,956 --> 00:45:39,958
Is that enough for you?

403
00:45:40,208 --> 00:45:41,626
Oi.

404
00:45:41,876 --> 00:45:44,045
- What?
- Is that enough for you?

405
00:45:44,295 --> 00:45:46,881
- Yes, that's fine.
- There's plenty more.

406
00:45:47,131 --> 00:45:50,718
That's fine.

407
00:45:55,932 --> 00:45:57,141
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

408
00:45:57,392 --> 00:45:59,143
- You're not eating.
- Eating what?

409
00:45:59,394 --> 00:46:05,984
- You're not eating like you used to.
- If you give me the plate, I'll eat.

410
00:46:18,871 --> 00:46:22,458
Now swallow.

411
00:46:26,838 --> 00:46:29,674
You should spend some money
instead of worrying about it.

412
00:46:29,924 --> 00:46:33,303
- You'd feel much better.
- Once it's spent, you don't have to worry.

413
00:46:33,553 --> 00:46:37,098
- It'll be a weight off your shoulders.
- You know we're right.

414
00:46:37,348 --> 00:46:40,852
- I wanna secure it.
- Secure it? You wanna put it in a bank?

415
00:46:41,102 --> 00:46:44,147
You don't wanna put it in a bank, do you?
Do you want to bury it?

416
00:46:44,397 --> 00:46:48,526
- I don't see the point. It's stupid.
- Course it's stupid. We took the money.

417
00:46:48,776 --> 00:46:51,112
It was a material calculation.

418
00:46:51,362 --> 00:46:55,241
What's the point if it's underground
in some funny bank in some funny place?

419
00:46:55,491 --> 00:46:58,828
If you can't have it - spend it -
then what use is it? None.

420
00:46:59,078 --> 00:47:03,583
It's all for nothing. I didn't get into this
for nothing, so that I could have nothing.

421
00:47:03,833 --> 00:47:08,254
Yeah, and you didn't saw his feet off.

422
00:47:14,886 --> 00:47:19,015
Tastes different.

423
00:47:49,837 --> 00:47:54,217
David, what are you doin' up there?

424
00:47:58,888 --> 00:48:03,977
Will you come down now?
It's not safe up there.

425
00:48:13,444 --> 00:48:16,614
Are you listening to me?

426
00:48:16,864 --> 00:48:21,744
Security and insanity
are not the same thing.

427
00:48:25,123 --> 00:48:28,710
Shit.

428
00:49:06,789 --> 00:49:11,669
I don't care. A grown man shouldn't
be living in a loft. He isn't safe up there.

429
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:16,424
If you cared about him at all,
you'd use your influence to get him down.

430
00:49:16,674 --> 00:49:19,052
- And the money?
- We could put it somewhere.

431
00:49:19,302 --> 00:49:22,096
Where he can't get it?

432
00:49:22,347 --> 00:49:24,599
Well, you thought of that, not me.

433
00:49:24,849 --> 00:49:28,853
Forget it. He'll come down.

434
00:49:28,895 --> 00:49:32,440
Oh, Juliet, look.

435
00:49:49,290 --> 00:49:51,876
Hello, Mr Lumsden.
It's David Stevens here.

436
00:49:52,126 --> 00:49:55,046
I'm sorry, sir. I won't be able
to make it to the office today.

437
00:49:55,296 --> 00:50:00,301
It's my mother, sir. She's very ill
and I think I need to be with her just now.

438
00:50:00,552 --> 00:50:04,722
I don't know. The doctors aren't sure.
It could go either way.

439
00:50:04,973 --> 00:50:09,269
Yes, sir. I'll certainly stay in touch.

440
00:50:42,385 --> 00:50:43,928
- Good day?
- What?

441
00:50:44,178 --> 00:50:46,514
- Good day?
- What are you talking about?

442
00:50:46,764 --> 00:50:49,851
- I'm just asking if you had a good day.
- Why?

443
00:50:50,101 --> 00:50:52,854
Well, I thought I'd make conversation.

444
00:50:53,104 --> 00:50:57,317
Please, I'd rather you didn't.

445
00:50:57,567 --> 00:51:00,904
- Are you expecting anyone?
- No.

446
00:51:01,154 --> 00:51:07,535
- Aren't you going to answer it?
- Well, I'm not expecting anyone either.

447
00:52:09,389 --> 00:52:14,602
It's in the loft! In the loft!

448
00:55:27,879 --> 00:55:30,465
September 19, London Heathrow
to Rio de Janeiro.

449
00:55:30,715 --> 00:55:34,719
It's British Airways.
You're looking at £765. That's 7-6-5.

450
00:55:34,969 --> 00:55:37,722
- That sounds fine.
- Air Portugal, on the other hand,...

451
00:55:37,972 --> 00:55:43,811
.. it's via Lisbon, the same day.
It's £565. 5-6-5. Is catering important?

452
00:55:44,062 --> 00:55:46,773
- What?
- Air France, Glasgow direct.

453
00:55:47,023 --> 00:55:50,610
But then you're looking at
the wrong end of £912. That's 9-1-2.

454
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:54,072
- The first one was fine. Heathrow direct.
- It's up to you.

455
00:55:54,322 --> 00:55:59,285
Air Patagonia, that's a new outfit.
Via... via lots of different places, really.

456
00:55:59,535 --> 00:56:05,625
It's no catering. That's £411. 4-1-1.
It's good value, but refuelling at Bogotá...

457
00:56:05,875 --> 00:56:08,419
The first one was fine.

458
00:56:08,670 --> 00:56:13,216
It's up to you. 7-6-5.
How will you be paying?

459
00:56:34,904 --> 00:56:39,242
Oh, God! Oh, Jesus Christ!

460
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:49,794
Oh, my God!

461
00:56:50,044 --> 00:56:52,005
Christ!

462
00:56:52,255 --> 00:56:57,135
No, no. Dear God. No! Christ!

463
00:57:35,256 --> 00:57:37,884
No, and that's it.
I refuse to discuss it any further.

464
00:57:38,134 --> 00:57:39,677
- It's the only way.
- I refuse.

465
00:57:39,928 --> 00:57:43,681
- You're frightened.
- I'm not frightened. I'm a little terrified.

466
00:57:43,932 --> 00:57:46,517
Did you see what happened
to the last two people?

467
00:57:46,768 --> 00:57:49,354
They went up alive and
they came back down dead.

468
00:57:49,604 --> 00:57:53,566
Did you notice that? The difference,
I mean. Alive, dead - dead, alive.

469
00:57:53,816 --> 00:57:57,153
It wasn't difficult to spot.

470
00:57:57,403 --> 00:57:59,697
He killed them both.

471
00:57:59,948 --> 00:58:04,285
- He cut them up.
- Yeah, but you'll be all right.

472
00:58:04,535 --> 00:58:09,874
- And how's that?
- Because you're smarter than he is.

473
00:58:11,709 --> 00:58:16,381
Yeah, well, that's what
I've always thought.

474
00:58:41,698 --> 00:58:45,785
Good evening. I'm Detective Inspector
McCall. This is DC Mitchell.

475
00:58:46,035 --> 00:58:48,079
I wonder if we could ask some questions.

476
00:58:48,329 --> 00:58:50,957
- What about?
- It's about the burglary.

477
00:58:51,207 --> 00:58:54,419
- Burglary?
- Downstairs.

478
00:58:54,669 --> 00:58:58,590
- Of course.
- Can we come in?

479
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:01,676
So I just heard
her cries for help and all that.

480
00:59:01,926 --> 00:59:04,804
When I went downstairs,
there were other people there.

481
00:59:05,054 --> 00:59:08,933
So I just stood around, you know,
waiting, the way people do.

482
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:12,478
And when your colleagues arrived,
I came back upstairs.

483
00:59:12,729 --> 00:59:17,317
That's about all, I think. I didn't actually
see anything useful, I don't think.

484
00:59:17,567 --> 00:59:20,153
And the other three people,
did they hear anything?

485
00:59:20,403 --> 00:59:24,908
There are only two
other people in the flat.

486
00:59:31,497 --> 00:59:35,752
- Two?
- Who said there were four?

487
00:59:36,085 --> 00:59:40,340
We understood there were four people
living here. Not always, but now four.

488
00:59:40,590 --> 00:59:43,426
No, three. Who said there were four?

489
00:59:43,676 --> 00:59:48,056
How strange. And how unsatisfactory
to have misleading information.

490
00:59:48,306 --> 00:59:50,600
Only three people here?

491
00:59:50,850 --> 00:59:53,144
- You're sure?
- Yes, absolutely.

492
00:59:53,394 --> 00:59:55,438
Who said there were four?

493
00:59:55,688 --> 01:00:00,401
Make a note of that, Mitchell.
Only three rather than four. Write it down.

494
01:00:00,652 --> 01:00:03,404
You can use numbers or words.
I've no preference.

495
01:00:03,655 --> 01:00:06,616
- Which are you using?
- Both, sir.

496
01:00:06,866 --> 01:00:09,786
Excellent.

497
01:00:10,036 --> 01:00:12,914
DC Mitchell is a rising star, Mr Stevens.

498
01:00:13,164 --> 01:00:17,001
Under my tutelage, he will
undoubtedly make the grade.

499
01:00:17,252 --> 01:00:21,256
- I see.
- I doubt it.

500
01:00:22,257 --> 01:00:24,259
- You'll wait in the hall?
- I'll wait.

501
01:00:24,509 --> 01:00:28,763
If it sounds like I'm getting killed,
call the police and tell them everything.

502
01:00:29,013 --> 01:00:31,724
Except maybe that it was
his idea in the first place.

503
01:00:31,975 --> 01:00:34,227
That's important.
I need to die misunderstood.

504
01:00:34,477 --> 01:00:36,020
- Alex.
- What?

505
01:00:36,271 --> 01:00:41,442
As smart as you are,
you might need a little help.

506
01:00:43,027 --> 01:00:49,492
David, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
open this lock and I'm gonna come up.

507
01:00:49,742 --> 01:00:55,331
But what's really important
is that you remain calm. OK?

508
01:01:41,085 --> 01:01:42,337
Alex?

509
01:01:42,587 --> 01:01:46,591
It's all right. It's just a pigeon.

510
01:02:00,897 --> 01:02:04,943
Well, he isn't up here.

511
01:02:08,446 --> 01:02:12,450
Tell him to look for the money.

512
01:02:17,497 --> 01:02:19,207
Look for the money.

513
01:02:19,457 --> 01:02:24,212
Don't worry.
That's exactly what I'm doin'.

514
01:02:34,305 --> 01:02:38,560
It's not up here. He has eaten it.

515
01:03:02,834 --> 01:03:05,837
Are you looking for me?

516
01:03:06,087 --> 01:03:08,131
Looking for you, yeah.

517
01:03:08,381 --> 01:03:12,093
What for? What did you want?
The money? Was that it?

518
01:03:12,343 --> 01:03:14,470
We just wanted to talk to you.

519
01:03:14,721 --> 01:03:20,310
Who else have you just wanted to talk to?
Maybe you thought they'd already got me.

520
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:24,564
- Who?
- Your friends.

521
01:03:25,064 --> 01:03:28,818
I don't know what you're talkin' about.

522
01:03:29,068 --> 01:03:33,364
He doesn't know, David.

523
01:03:35,658 --> 01:03:38,286
Maybe you don't.

524
01:03:38,536 --> 01:03:41,080
I'm talking about the police.

525
01:07:10,290 --> 01:07:14,085
I thought you'd gone to work.

526
01:07:14,377 --> 01:07:18,172
With a face like this?

527
01:07:34,230 --> 01:07:38,234
Alex, the editor wants to see you.

528
01:07:46,743 --> 01:07:51,372
- I'm sorry.
- So you should be.

529
01:07:54,125 --> 01:07:58,546
Maybe we can still sort everything out.

530
01:08:02,842 --> 01:08:07,055
Well, we can certainly try.

531
01:08:09,432 --> 01:08:14,145
Three bodies. Decomposed.
Mutilated beyond recognition.

532
01:08:14,395 --> 01:08:17,857
- I don't know anythin' about it.
- Of course you don't.

533
01:08:18,107 --> 01:08:21,653
If you knew anything about it,
I wouldn't have to send you to cover it.

534
01:08:21,903 --> 01:08:25,531
- Cover it?
- That's right. This is your break, son.

535
01:08:25,782 --> 01:08:28,368
Cover it?

536
01:08:30,787 --> 01:08:34,374
Jesus.

537
01:08:49,389 --> 01:08:52,976
Ow!

538
01:10:06,090 --> 01:10:12,013
All right. The releasable and printworthy
facts of the day so far are as follows.

539
01:10:12,263 --> 01:10:16,559
Late yesterday, forestry workers
came across one set of human remains...

540
01:10:16,809 --> 01:10:19,646
.. in a grave which appeared
to have been recently dug.

541
01:10:19,896 --> 01:10:25,068
Further excavation revealed another
deeper grave with two sets of remains.

542
01:10:25,318 --> 01:10:31,199
- Is this a serial killer?
- How come they haven't been identified?

543
01:10:31,449 --> 01:10:35,787
- Any obvious motive here?
- Is it true that one has been skinned?

544
01:10:36,037 --> 01:10:38,289
Not entirely.

545
01:10:38,539 --> 01:10:42,001
All right, all right.
An area of skin "has" been removed.

546
01:10:42,252 --> 01:10:46,756
And you'd better keep this to yourselves.
There's no hands, no feet, no teeth.

547
01:10:47,006 --> 01:10:49,884
The face is totally
unrecognisable and, yes,...

548
01:10:50,134 --> 01:10:54,556
.. skin has been removed
from one of the bodies.

549
01:10:54,889 --> 01:10:57,058
As and when the corpses are removed,...

550
01:10:57,308 --> 01:11:01,604
.. we will endeavour to ascertain the
mode of death and duration of burial,...

551
01:11:01,854 --> 01:11:06,609
.. as well as identification, which
will of course be passed on to you,...

552
01:11:06,859 --> 01:11:11,364
.. after informing,
where possible, the next of kin.

553
01:11:58,202 --> 01:12:01,289
- Are you OK?
- Yes, of course.

554
01:12:01,539 --> 01:12:05,543
Why wouldn't I be?

555
01:12:06,336 --> 01:12:12,258
- I don't know. I just thought maybe...
- We were just sorting things out.

556
01:12:13,301 --> 01:12:15,887
- You'd better read all about it.
- We already know.

557
01:12:16,137 --> 01:12:17,722
It was on the television.

558
01:12:17,972 --> 01:12:20,600
Of course, but print
provides a more lucid and...

559
01:12:20,850 --> 01:12:22,894
Oh, shut up, Alex.

560
01:12:23,144 --> 01:12:27,232
It wasn't deep enough. I told you it wasn't
deep enough and you wouldn't listen.

561
01:12:27,482 --> 01:12:29,484
It doesn't necessarily matter.

562
01:12:29,734 --> 01:12:33,988
They don't know who they are and have
nothing to connect us with them. Nothing.

563
01:12:34,239 --> 01:12:36,532
I'm glad you're so certain, Alex.

564
01:12:36,783 --> 01:12:39,035
It makes us feel a whole lot better.

565
01:12:39,285 --> 01:12:45,208
- I beg your pardon?
- It makes us feel a whole lot better.

566
01:12:45,792 --> 01:12:49,379
That's what I thought he said.

567
01:13:13,444 --> 01:13:15,363
Shh. Stop.

568
01:13:15,613 --> 01:13:17,824
What are you doin' here?

569
01:13:18,074 --> 01:13:20,034
It's about me and David.

570
01:13:20,285 --> 01:13:24,539
- The perfect couple, I should say.
- You mustn't take it so badly.

571
01:13:24,789 --> 01:13:29,335
Don't worry. I'd do exactly the same
thing, only I don't think I'm his type.

572
01:13:29,586 --> 01:13:34,215
- Don't you ever stop?
- No.

573
01:13:58,907 --> 01:14:02,243
Take all the time you like, Doctor.

574
01:14:02,493 --> 01:14:05,663
No, I've never seen any of them.

575
01:14:05,914 --> 01:14:09,500
Look again, if you like.

576
01:14:14,714 --> 01:14:17,258
I'm sorry, I haven't seen them.

577
01:14:17,508 --> 01:14:21,054
- Do you have a good memory for faces?
- The same as everyone else.

578
01:14:21,304 --> 01:14:26,017
But in your work you must meet lots of
people every day. New people, new faces.

579
01:14:26,267 --> 01:14:27,727
Yes.

580
01:14:27,977 --> 01:14:30,521
What do you recognise most,
names or faces?

581
01:14:30,772 --> 01:14:33,816
Diseases.

582
01:14:34,067 --> 01:14:38,238
Like recognising criminals
by their crimes.

583
01:14:38,488 --> 01:14:43,243
- I suppose so.
- I meant, that's what it's like.

584
01:14:43,493 --> 01:14:45,870
- Sorry?
- You said you supposed so.

585
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:49,666
- I wasn't offering it for debate.
- He wasn't offering it for debate.

586
01:14:49,916 --> 01:14:54,879
Like recognising criminals
by their crimes.

587
01:15:19,571 --> 01:15:23,199
No, I've never seen
any of these men before.

588
01:15:23,449 --> 01:15:27,120
Take a look at the first two.

589
01:15:29,372 --> 01:15:31,291
No, I don't know them.

590
01:15:31,541 --> 01:15:38,798
If I told you their car was parked outside
just now, would that surprise you?

591
01:15:41,926 --> 01:15:46,139
Yes, I suppose so.

592
01:15:48,349 --> 01:15:50,435
Well, is it?

593
01:15:50,685 --> 01:15:53,855
- What?
- Parked there?

594
01:15:54,105 --> 01:15:56,608
No. Not any more.

595
01:15:56,858 --> 01:16:01,446
I just wondered if it would surprise you.

596
01:16:02,822 --> 01:16:04,490
- That's it.
- That's all?

597
01:16:04,741 --> 01:16:06,576
Yes.

598
01:16:06,826 --> 01:16:12,415
- Sorry to waste your time.
- Oh, not at all. Don't worry.

599
01:16:13,207 --> 01:16:15,501
- One thing.
- Your watch.

600
01:16:15,752 --> 01:16:18,463
- Your watch.
- Is it real?

601
01:16:18,713 --> 01:16:23,343
Oh, no. It's a fake. I got it in Thailand.
The second hand doesn't sweep.

602
01:16:23,593 --> 01:16:27,180
- I see.
- Right.

603
01:16:27,222 --> 01:16:31,392
Tell you what. If you do
remember these guys,...

604
01:16:31,643 --> 01:16:35,521
.. maybe you could give me
a phone on this number.

605
01:16:35,772 --> 01:16:39,901
Any time you like.

606
01:16:45,031 --> 01:16:49,452
I didn't tell them anything, nothing
at all, absolutely nothing. They're plods.

607
01:16:49,702 --> 01:16:54,791
If they had any witnesses, any forensic
evidence, they would have whipped it out.

608
01:16:55,041 --> 01:16:58,419
- They know.
- They can know all they like.

609
01:16:58,670 --> 01:17:00,838
- They know.
- So? They know.

610
01:17:01,089 --> 01:17:04,717
So what? There's nothing
to connect us with that body stuff.

611
01:17:04,968 --> 01:17:09,931
- Except the money.
- He's right, Alex. They know.

612
01:19:51,134 --> 01:19:54,387
Come on.

613
01:19:54,637 --> 01:19:56,347
My office is closed.

614
01:19:56,598 --> 01:19:59,350
Life, however, grinds on
towards its conclusion.

615
01:19:59,601 --> 01:20:04,647
In the meantime, you may wish to leave a
message, but the final decision is yours.

616
01:20:10,111 --> 01:20:14,741
David? You forgot to wake me.

617
01:20:25,835 --> 01:20:30,256
- So let's go.
- You and me?

618
01:20:30,798 --> 01:20:34,802
Together.

619
01:20:35,261 --> 01:20:40,934
Hey! Alex! Who are you calling
at this time of night?

620
01:20:45,688 --> 01:20:49,275
Come out here and talk to us.

621
01:21:04,499 --> 01:21:08,253
Well? Sex lines, is that it?

622
01:21:08,503 --> 01:21:11,965
Triple-X-rated, interactive fantasies?
Old habits die hard.

623
01:21:12,215 --> 01:21:16,052
- I was phoning your mother.
- You old devil.

624
01:21:16,302 --> 01:21:19,806
Well, anyway.
As you can see, we're leaving.

625
01:21:20,056 --> 01:21:23,017
- So I gathered.
- I'm sorry, but that's the way it is.

626
01:21:23,268 --> 01:21:26,854
- Don't worry. I'll forward your mail.
- No, really.

627
01:21:27,105 --> 01:21:31,693
I am sorry. Sorry to be ducking out on
you. I hope you won't take it personally.

628
01:21:31,943 --> 01:21:35,321
No, no. Don't let it worry you.
It's probably for the best.

629
01:21:35,572 --> 01:21:41,202
All for the best. Exactly. I wouldn't
want things to end on a downer.

630
01:21:41,452 --> 01:21:44,372
- Not at all.
- I mean, we've ups and downs, right.

631
01:21:44,622 --> 01:21:47,709
Good times, bad times.

632
01:21:47,959 --> 01:21:50,461
We could talk all night,
but we have to go. Don't we?

633
01:21:50,712 --> 01:21:52,964
Yes.

634
01:21:53,214 --> 01:21:57,427
- And you need your sleep.
- Yes.

635
01:22:01,180 --> 01:22:04,267
No, I can't think of
anything else that matters.

636
01:22:04,517 --> 01:22:07,395
- About your mail.
- Very good of you to offer, but...

637
01:22:07,645 --> 01:22:09,689
Where do you think you'll go?

638
01:22:09,939 --> 01:22:12,442
Where will we go?

639
01:22:12,692 --> 01:22:14,694
Where will we go?

640
01:22:14,944 --> 01:22:16,905
Juliet?

641
01:22:17,155 --> 01:22:19,824
- I don't know.
- Don't be so coy, dear.

642
01:22:20,074 --> 01:22:22,285
You're going to Rio.

643
01:22:22,535 --> 01:22:25,288
- What?
- That's right.

644
01:22:25,538 --> 01:22:27,999
Rio de Janeiro, on your own.

645
01:22:28,249 --> 01:22:33,796
You should know.
You bought the fucking ticket!

646
01:22:37,759 --> 01:22:40,470
Did you see that?

647
01:22:40,720 --> 01:22:44,349
I bet she didn't show you that before
she sent you up there. What did she say?

648
01:22:44,599 --> 01:22:49,520
We'll split it together,
you and me, fifty-fifty.

649
01:22:51,231 --> 01:22:53,399
But I bet you didn't say you'd split on him.

650
01:22:53,650 --> 01:22:56,861
- It wasn't like that.
- Don't lie to me. Don't treat me like that.

651
01:22:57,111 --> 01:23:00,698
I bought it.

652
01:23:01,115 --> 01:23:03,660
What?

653
01:23:03,910 --> 01:23:06,829
I bought the tickets.
For her and for me. It was my idea.

654
01:23:07,080 --> 01:23:09,415
Your idea. I see.

655
01:23:09,666 --> 01:23:11,501
Well, that fits.

656
01:23:11,751 --> 01:23:16,464
I mean, you and him fit together.
I should have seen that a long time ago.

657
01:23:16,714 --> 01:23:19,801
- Alex, stop him!
- No, let him go. Let him have it all.

658
01:23:20,051 --> 01:23:24,055
Juliet, let him go.

659
01:23:25,890 --> 01:23:29,477
I'm leaving.

660
01:23:35,650 --> 01:23:42,156
You shouldn't have hit her! Do what
you like, but you shouldn't have hit her!

661
01:23:57,463 --> 01:24:00,675
You want it?

662
01:24:00,925 --> 01:24:02,218
You want it?

663
01:24:02,468 --> 01:24:05,471
Aagh!

664
01:24:05,847 --> 01:24:09,851
You bastard!

665
01:25:59,294 --> 01:26:03,339
You did the right thing.

666
01:26:03,381 --> 01:26:07,302
But I can't take you with me.

667
01:27:19,249 --> 01:27:21,584
Be OK, Mummy.

668
01:27:21,834 --> 01:27:25,546
Oh, I'll be all right.

669
01:27:44,983 --> 01:27:48,570
Hello, Inspector.

670
01:28:13,094 --> 01:28:16,931
# It's the sound that lovers

671
01:28:17,181 --> 01:28:21,436
# Hear when they discover

672
01:28:21,686 --> 01:28:30,403
# There could be no other for their love

673
01:28:30,653 --> 01:28:36,868
# It's my happy heart you hear

674
01:28:37,118 --> 01:28:40,955
# Singing loud and singing clear

675
01:28:41,205 --> 01:28:45,418
# And it's all because you're near

676
01:28:45,668 --> 01:28:49,422
# Me, my love

677
01:28:49,672 --> 01:28:53,968
# Take my happy heart away

678
01:28:54,219 --> 01:28:58,139
# Let me love you night and day

679
01:28:58,389 --> 01:29:02,518
# In your arms I wanna stay

680
01:29:02,769 --> 01:29:09,400
# Oh, my love #

681
01:29:10,902 --> 01:29:14,280
Oh, yes. I believe in friends.

682
01:29:14,530 --> 01:29:16,741
I believe we need them.

683
01:29:16,991 --> 01:29:21,162
But, if one day you find that
you just can't trust them any more,...

684
01:29:21,412 --> 01:29:23,665
.. well what then?

685
01:29:23,915 --> 01:29:27,502
What then?

686
01:29:29,379 --> 01:29:33,383
# Music fills my soul now

687
01:29:33,633 --> 01:29:37,637
# I've lost all control now

688
01:29:37,887 --> 01:29:41,266
# I'm not half, I'm whole now

689
01:29:41,516 --> 01:29:46,396
# With your love

690
01:29:46,646 --> 01:29:52,735
# It's my happy heart you hear

691
01:29:52,986 --> 01:29:57,031
# Singing loud and singing clear

692
01:29:57,282 --> 01:30:01,536
# And it's all because you're near

693
01:30:01,786 --> 01:30:05,540
# Me, my love

694
01:30:05,790 --> 01:30:09,794
# Take my happy heart away

695
01:30:10,044 --> 01:30:14,090
# Let me love you night and day

696
01:30:14,340 --> 01:30:18,303
# In your arms I wanna stay

697
01:30:18,553 --> 01:30:24,183
# All night long #

698
01:30:25,183 --> 01:30:35,183
