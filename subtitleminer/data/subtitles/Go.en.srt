00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,586
You know what I like about Christmas?
The surprises.

2
00:01:22,837 --> 00:01:25,756
You get this box and you're
sure of what's inside.

3
00:01:26,048 --> 00:01:27,341
You shake it, weigh it.

4
00:01:27,591 --> 00:01:30,678
You're convinced you have it pegged.
No doubt in your mind.

5
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:33,264
But then you open it
and it's different.

6
00:01:33,556 --> 00:01:35,432
You know. Wow! Bang! Surprise!

7
00:01:35,724 --> 00:01:38,644
I mean, it's kind of like
you and me here, you know?

8
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:43,107
I'm not saying it's anything it's not.

9
00:01:44,024 --> 00:01:47,111
Come on, this time yesterday,
who would've thunk it?

10
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:03,168
Paper or plastic?

11
00:02:06,088 --> 00:02:07,965
Paper or plastic?

12
00:02:10,467 --> 00:02:13,053
- Paper or plastic?
- Both.

13
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:18,767
You didn't double my coupons?

14
00:02:20,018 --> 00:02:23,939
They're at the bottom in red,
where it says "double coupons."

15
00:02:30,362 --> 00:02:34,407
You can't put bleach in
the same bag as food. It's poison.

16
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,296
Don't think you're something
you're not. I had your job.

17
00:02:51,383 --> 00:02:53,259
Look how far it got you.

18
00:02:58,848 --> 00:03:02,894
Nothing brings back warm holiday
memories like the songs you love.

19
00:03:03,144 --> 00:03:04,521
- Don't.
- Why not?

20
00:03:04,813 --> 00:03:07,565
Because she's been on for 14 hours.

21
00:03:09,734 --> 00:03:11,277
- Ronna?
- No.

22
00:03:11,653 --> 00:03:13,696
- I didn't ask yet.
- The answer's no.

23
00:03:13,947 --> 00:03:15,740
Christmas is a time for giving.

24
00:03:16,032 --> 00:03:17,200
Mistletoe?

25
00:03:19,619 --> 00:03:22,789
Pardon me if I'm not in
a holly-jolly mood right now.

26
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:24,499
I'm getting evicted.

27
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,626
Tomorrow.

28
00:03:27,085 --> 00:03:29,545
They wouldn't evict you at Christmas.

29
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,423
You'd be ho-ho-homeless.

30
00:03:33,675 --> 00:03:35,134
- How much you owe?
- $380.

31
00:03:35,426 --> 00:03:37,303
- That's nothing.
- It's more than I got.

32
00:03:37,553 --> 00:03:38,471
Want my shift?

33
00:03:40,765 --> 00:03:43,434
My best mates are going
to Las Vegas this weekend.

34
00:03:43,726 --> 00:03:46,229
I've never been.
I'm told it's incredible.

35
00:03:46,521 --> 00:03:50,358
If you take my shift,
I can go with them. Everybody wins.

36
00:03:53,653 --> 00:03:55,196
Cash up front?

37
00:03:56,781 --> 00:03:57,949
Deal.

38
00:04:00,493 --> 00:04:03,079
I'll throw in an extra $20
for a blowjob.

39
00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:10,419
Any available cashier.

40
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:12,963
I need a cashier up at the front.

41
00:04:16,467 --> 00:04:18,427
Look, I went the last time.

42
00:04:18,677 --> 00:04:21,138
Okay. Dead Celebrities.
Loser goes up.

43
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,264
Omar Sharif.

44
00:04:25,309 --> 00:04:26,477
Steve McQueen.

45
00:04:27,436 --> 00:04:28,437
Michael Landon.

46
00:04:29,188 --> 00:04:30,189
Lee Marvin.

47
00:04:32,066 --> 00:04:32,900
Shit.

48
00:04:37,821 --> 00:04:39,198
Malcolm X.

49
00:04:44,495 --> 00:04:45,871
You can't say Malcolm X.

50
00:04:46,205 --> 00:04:47,748
He's famous. He's dead.

51
00:04:47,998 --> 00:04:50,125
That's a rule.
Nothing starts with an "X."

52
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:51,919
That's not my problem.

53
00:04:52,211 --> 00:04:53,462
You can challenge.

54
00:04:53,754 --> 00:04:55,214
- I challenge.
- Bullshit!

55
00:04:55,422 --> 00:04:57,883
Give me one dead celebrity
that begins with an "X."

56
00:04:59,635 --> 00:05:00,636
Fuck!

57
00:05:01,553 --> 00:05:04,556
There is one.
I know I thought of one before.

58
00:05:06,141 --> 00:05:09,144
Break was over four minutes ago.
Who's up front?

59
00:05:18,904 --> 00:05:20,280
I am.

60
00:05:26,703 --> 00:05:27,996
X erxes.

61
00:05:28,288 --> 00:05:29,206
X erxes.

62
00:05:29,456 --> 00:05:32,459
Some dead pharaoh guy,
and his name starts with an "X."

63
00:05:32,709 --> 00:05:35,712
That wasn't it.
Never heard of fucking X erxes.

64
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,840
Pharaoh could've saved your ass.

65
00:05:39,091 --> 00:05:40,717
There's an opera about him.

66
00:05:41,218 --> 00:05:42,427
X erxes.

67
00:05:42,761 --> 00:05:44,805
I took Music Appreciation twice.

68
00:05:45,305 --> 00:05:49,226
What do you mean, he's snowed in?
What's he doing in Chicago anyway?

69
00:05:49,518 --> 00:05:52,103
Look, just call me
when you get to a landline.

70
00:05:52,437 --> 00:05:54,981
He can't get out of the airport.
We're fucked.

71
00:05:55,315 --> 00:05:56,691
Is the British guy still here?

72
00:05:57,233 --> 00:05:58,693
He went to Vegas for the weekend.

73
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,613
Vegas.

74
00:06:06,451 --> 00:06:07,369
Hi...

75
00:06:07,994 --> 00:06:09,371
...Ronna. Right?

76
00:06:11,247 --> 00:06:14,084
Where can I get something
to go with this juice?

77
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:15,919
Doughnuts, aisle four.

78
00:06:16,211 --> 00:06:18,588
I was hoping for something
more euphoric.

79
00:06:18,838 --> 00:06:20,715
The British guy hooks us up.

80
00:06:23,092 --> 00:06:23,927
How much?

81
00:06:24,219 --> 00:06:26,095
- Twenty at $20.
- You're overpaying.

82
00:06:26,346 --> 00:06:30,391
We're desperate. We're going to
a party at a warehouse. What is it?

83
00:06:31,476 --> 00:06:32,727
"Mary X-mas Superfest."

84
00:06:33,269 --> 00:06:35,563
- You going?
- We had a pre-party planned.

85
00:06:35,855 --> 00:06:39,025
But it's all or nothing
because there's 20 of us.

86
00:06:39,317 --> 00:06:43,071
My friend's stuck in Chicago.
He was supposed to come through for us.

87
00:06:43,363 --> 00:06:45,406
We're dead.
If you could do anything...

88
00:06:46,657 --> 00:06:48,117
...to help us out...

89
00:06:48,534 --> 00:06:49,368
Please.

90
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,130
I'll see.
Give me your number.

91
00:07:02,006 --> 00:07:04,383
Kick ass! Thank you.

92
00:07:06,052 --> 00:07:07,762
So you wanna buy all this OJ?

93
00:07:08,054 --> 00:07:09,347
Absolutely.

94
00:07:16,354 --> 00:07:17,730
You know Simon's in Vegas?

95
00:07:18,022 --> 00:07:20,232
I don't need Simon. I'm going to Todd.

96
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:21,942
Todd Gaines?

97
00:07:22,318 --> 00:07:23,527
Who's Todd Gaines?

98
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:25,529
That's Simon's dealer.

99
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:28,074
You can't go around Simon like that.

100
00:07:28,616 --> 00:07:32,119
Listen, if Simon were here,
which he's not, he'd charge $15...

101
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:35,581
...when he gets it for $10.
Times 20 hits, that's $100.

102
00:07:35,873 --> 00:07:39,919
It's a leap. You're moving up
the drug food chain without permission.

103
00:07:40,336 --> 00:07:41,712
You shouldn't do this.

104
00:07:42,004 --> 00:07:45,966
Why can't you chill the fuck out, okay?
It's just once.

105
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:49,845
When Simon gets back, we can still
overpay if it makes you happy.

106
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:51,555
But this is my deal.

107
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:53,849
Just sit back and watch.

108
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,501
- Speak.
- Todd, it's Ronna Martin.

109
00:08:21,752 --> 00:08:23,545
You know me through Simon.

110
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:27,007
Can I come up?

111
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:52,365
I thought you bought
quarters off of Simon.

112
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:54,910
At least, what Simon
pretends are quarters.

113
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:56,912
I keep him honest.

114
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:01,124
At that level, you should pinch.
It's the economics.

115
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,251
You leaving?

116
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:20,393
Be good.

117
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:25,440
I take it this is not a social call.

118
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,111
I need a favour.

119
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:33,031
I didn't know we were
such good friends.

120
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:36,284
If we were, you'd know
I give head before I give favours.

121
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,870
I ain't giving my best friends head...

122
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:42,165
...so your chance of getting a favour
is pretty slim.

123
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:44,334
Tell me what you wanna buy.

124
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,377
Twenty hits of Ecstasy.

125
00:10:37,344 --> 00:10:40,514
You come here out of the blue
asking for 20 hits...

126
00:10:40,764 --> 00:10:45,060
...when 20 is the magic number where
"intent to sell" becomes "trafficking"?

127
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:49,231
- I'd never fuck you like that.
- How would you fuck me?

128
00:11:09,209 --> 00:11:10,377
This is real.

129
00:11:10,669 --> 00:11:13,922
Pharmaceutical grade,
not that crunchy, herbal rave shit.

130
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:17,801
Don't let anybody double dose.
They'll fry in the emergency room.

131
00:11:18,093 --> 00:11:20,846
- Understood.
- Only one hit per headbanger.

132
00:11:21,096 --> 00:11:22,556
Understood.

133
00:11:24,516 --> 00:11:26,143
Twenty at $15 is $300.

134
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:28,812
Fifteen?

135
00:11:30,105 --> 00:11:32,566
I was thinking more like 10.

136
00:11:33,108 --> 00:11:35,068
I know you charge Simon 10.

137
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,571
Inflation is a bitch.

138
00:11:39,656 --> 00:11:42,492
There are 20 of us.
I need all of this.

139
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:45,662
But I only have $200.
That's all I have.

140
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:49,040
No, no. Hear me out.

141
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:52,461
Hear me out, okay?
This $200 is like a down payment.

142
00:11:52,836 --> 00:11:55,046
All right?
You give me the stuff...

143
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:58,383
...I go to them, get the extra $100,
come back and pay you.

144
00:11:58,675 --> 00:12:02,971
That would be doing you a favour.
And you know how I feel about favours.

145
00:12:03,263 --> 00:12:05,056
I could leave something with you.

146
00:12:05,974 --> 00:12:07,350
Collateral.

147
00:12:07,934 --> 00:12:10,478
I already got a fucking Swatch.

148
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:13,523
I need something
I know you'll come back for.

149
00:12:14,899 --> 00:12:17,027
- I'm not going.
- It's 45 minutes.

150
00:12:17,277 --> 00:12:18,987
Hour, tops. Just sit there.

151
00:12:19,237 --> 00:12:20,321
He's a drug dealer.

152
00:12:20,613 --> 00:12:23,074
Jesus, Claire.
Don't get 8-1-8 on me here.

153
00:12:23,324 --> 00:12:24,951
How much have I done for you?

154
00:12:25,243 --> 00:12:27,745
No. You're making me an accessory.

155
00:12:28,163 --> 00:12:31,666
Claire, my bracelet you're wearing,
that's an accessory.

156
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:34,586
You're just some chick
sitting in an apartment.

157
00:12:35,003 --> 00:12:36,337
I'm not.

158
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:40,133
Okay. No bullshit, okay?

159
00:12:41,342 --> 00:12:45,013
I don't get this money, I get evicted.
My ass is on the street.

160
00:12:48,808 --> 00:12:52,061
Claire, I don't have anyone else
to go to, okay?

161
00:12:52,312 --> 00:12:55,231
I'm coming to you
and I am asking for help.

162
00:12:55,481 --> 00:12:56,858
Please.

163
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:05,491
Fine. 45 minutes.
That's 8:00.

164
00:13:05,741 --> 00:13:08,035
We'll be back by 8. I promise.

165
00:13:16,669 --> 00:13:18,462
It's 237.

166
00:13:19,255 --> 00:13:21,799
Jesus! Next time, ask for directions.

167
00:13:34,937 --> 00:13:35,938
You're a pro.

168
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:38,190
I'm a top-seeded amateur.

169
00:13:41,902 --> 00:13:44,405
And I'm a very happy man.

170
00:13:53,747 --> 00:13:57,418
Come on in.
Damn glad to meet you, Rhonda.

171
00:13:57,668 --> 00:13:58,502
Ronna.

172
00:13:58,794 --> 00:14:01,880
When I heard Philly got snowed in,
I told these guys...

173
00:14:02,172 --> 00:14:05,092
...it was getting loose there.
I'm glad we found you.

174
00:14:06,552 --> 00:14:08,095
Work, work, work.

175
00:14:08,846 --> 00:14:10,889
Friday must be a busy night.

176
00:14:12,057 --> 00:14:13,851
That was just a friend.

177
00:14:14,977 --> 00:14:16,520
What can I get you to drink?

178
00:14:17,771 --> 00:14:19,898
Some of that orange juice
would be great.

179
00:14:20,274 --> 00:14:21,275
Great.

180
00:14:30,409 --> 00:14:31,577
All right.

181
00:14:34,746 --> 00:14:36,290
I understand...

182
00:14:37,457 --> 00:14:39,584
...this party's gonna be huge.

183
00:14:39,835 --> 00:14:40,669
Massive.

184
00:14:41,086 --> 00:14:42,462
Traci Lords is a promoter.

185
00:14:42,713 --> 00:14:43,797
She is.

186
00:14:45,549 --> 00:14:47,175
That's what I heard.

187
00:14:50,053 --> 00:14:53,140
Ron, hon, we are fresh out of OJ.
Cerveza?

188
00:14:57,185 --> 00:15:00,856
Hey, we bought a bunch
of orange juice tonight.

189
00:15:01,106 --> 00:15:03,859
I just left it in the car.
But I can go get it.

190
00:15:07,028 --> 00:15:10,282
Zack tells me that you've got 20 at $20.
Is that right?

191
00:15:13,618 --> 00:15:14,786
You got a bathroom?

192
00:15:15,453 --> 00:15:17,247
It's down the hall on the right.

193
00:15:17,539 --> 00:15:18,540
Let me show you.

194
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:23,003
Maybe we could do this first?

195
00:15:33,221 --> 00:15:34,222
Fuck!

196
00:15:34,472 --> 00:15:38,685
We said Chicago. You said Philly.
I mean, maybe she didn't notice.

197
00:15:39,018 --> 00:15:41,062
Everybody just keep it calm.
We're good.

198
00:15:49,028 --> 00:15:50,029
You're fine.

199
00:16:04,335 --> 00:16:06,212
Everything all right?

200
00:16:06,838 --> 00:16:07,755
Fine.

201
00:16:09,549 --> 00:16:10,550
Shit!

202
00:16:19,767 --> 00:16:20,768
Shit!

203
00:16:25,523 --> 00:16:26,983
It's all yours.

204
00:16:33,781 --> 00:16:36,450
Ronna, hon, do we got
a deal here or not?

205
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:41,872
No, actually, we don't. I came
to tell you I couldn't get anything.

206
00:16:42,164 --> 00:16:45,000
A resourceful girl like you?
I don't believe that.

207
00:16:45,501 --> 00:16:46,752
It's true.

208
00:16:48,963 --> 00:16:51,423
I just wanna make a deal here.
Can we?

209
00:16:51,715 --> 00:16:53,759
Who the fuck are you? Monty Hall?

210
00:16:57,596 --> 00:16:59,390
Did you know I'm only 17?

211
00:17:00,599 --> 00:17:03,936
I probably shouldn't be drinking beer.
Seeing as I'm so...

212
00:17:04,478 --> 00:17:06,272
...underage and all?

213
00:17:13,821 --> 00:17:16,198
That means, get away from the door.

214
00:17:22,871 --> 00:17:25,415
We go back to Todd's,
say they didn't show up...

215
00:17:25,707 --> 00:17:27,501
...then exchange the pills for Claire.

216
00:17:27,793 --> 00:17:28,877
We can't.

217
00:17:29,169 --> 00:17:31,630
- Why not?
- Because they're gone! I flushed them!

218
00:17:32,089 --> 00:17:33,632
Think of something.

219
00:17:34,216 --> 00:17:36,260
I need 100 bucks or 20 hits of X.

220
00:17:40,013 --> 00:17:41,181
What?

221
00:17:46,561 --> 00:17:48,438
You took one, didn't you?

222
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:52,901
Fuck you, Mannie!

223
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:55,987
How could you do this to me?
I need you now.

224
00:17:56,655 --> 00:17:58,198
Drive!

225
00:17:58,657 --> 00:17:59,825
Where?

226
00:18:00,075 --> 00:18:01,701
Just drive.

227
00:18:02,494 --> 00:18:03,662
I have an idea.

228
00:20:19,088 --> 00:20:21,048
Were they round or oval?

229
00:20:21,757 --> 00:20:22,925
White.

230
00:20:24,134 --> 00:20:25,219
Round.

231
00:20:25,636 --> 00:20:27,012
Like aspirin.

232
00:20:27,888 --> 00:20:29,598
Like baby aspirin.

233
00:20:33,352 --> 00:20:35,145
A or B?

234
00:20:36,688 --> 00:20:37,523
B.

235
00:20:37,814 --> 00:20:38,649
You're sure?

236
00:20:39,358 --> 00:20:41,652
Well, I wasn't really looking.

237
00:20:43,779 --> 00:20:45,989
Stop fucking paging me, Claire!

238
00:20:59,169 --> 00:21:00,253
Speak.

239
00:21:01,922 --> 00:21:03,465
I'm just licking my dick.

240
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:05,425
What's up with you?

241
00:21:06,343 --> 00:21:09,596
It's called the Crazy Horse.
You have to look it up.

242
00:21:10,388 --> 00:21:13,225
I don't know what I'm up to.
Where's this party at?

243
00:21:16,186 --> 00:21:18,563
The party?
Where's it at?

244
00:21:28,573 --> 00:21:30,784
It's called "Mary X-mas."

245
00:21:31,034 --> 00:21:32,827
"Mary," like a chick.

246
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,414
Like her name is Mary.

247
00:21:36,664 --> 00:21:39,667
Not like you marry her,
you fucking moron.

248
00:21:39,959 --> 00:21:43,296
I don't know. It's some warehouse shit.
Will this be cool?

249
00:21:44,047 --> 00:21:45,048
Yeah, I guess.

250
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:49,969
My friend Claire here says
it's gonna be a kick-ass fucking time.

251
00:21:51,262 --> 00:21:52,805
What, you know her?

252
00:21:53,973 --> 00:21:55,934
It's your buddy Simon.
He's in Vegas.

253
00:21:56,893 --> 00:21:58,061
Yeah, I know.

254
00:21:58,937 --> 00:22:00,563
She knows.

255
00:22:01,981 --> 00:22:03,775
Hell, I don't know.

256
00:22:06,402 --> 00:22:07,320
Maybe.

257
00:22:10,239 --> 00:22:12,992
Well, save a load for me, big boy.

258
00:22:13,284 --> 00:22:14,660
Whatever.

259
00:22:26,839 --> 00:22:29,217
What do you want for Christmas, Claire?

260
00:22:30,801 --> 00:22:32,178
I don't know.

261
00:22:33,304 --> 00:22:34,680
Do you wanna get laid?

262
00:22:36,182 --> 00:22:37,183
No.

263
00:22:38,643 --> 00:22:40,686
No, you don't wanna get laid?

264
00:22:40,937 --> 00:22:44,273
Or no, you do, but you don't wanna
get laid with me?

265
00:22:44,565 --> 00:22:45,858
Look, they'll be here.

266
00:22:50,154 --> 00:22:51,697
They'll be here.

267
00:22:57,453 --> 00:22:58,788
Are you a virgin?

268
00:23:00,122 --> 00:23:01,373
What?

269
00:23:01,624 --> 00:23:03,501
Come on, Claire.

270
00:23:04,585 --> 00:23:06,212
Answer the question.

271
00:23:06,462 --> 00:23:09,381
Answer the question, Claire!

272
00:23:11,008 --> 00:23:13,302
Breakfast Club. I get it.
Very funny.

273
00:23:18,766 --> 00:23:20,392
Don't say anything.

274
00:23:21,185 --> 00:23:23,312
Try not to look so stoned.

275
00:23:26,148 --> 00:23:28,984
This girl's brother already
came through with it...

276
00:23:29,526 --> 00:23:30,986
I understand that.

277
00:23:35,324 --> 00:23:38,744
Let me just, you know,
fill out a return slip here...

278
00:23:39,036 --> 00:23:41,413
...and the manager will give
you a refund.

279
00:23:41,663 --> 00:23:44,208
I'm trying to explain to you
what happened.

280
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:48,545
They already got the stuff somewhere
else. It was a miscommunication.

281
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,837
I can hear your thoughts.

282
00:24:33,632 --> 00:24:35,508
Xiang Kai-Shek.

283
00:24:36,051 --> 00:24:38,511
Famous Chinese ruler.
Starts with "X."

284
00:24:39,846 --> 00:24:43,808
No, "C"
Chiang Kai-Shek.

285
00:24:44,601 --> 00:24:46,728
You're going to die.

286
00:24:53,776 --> 00:24:55,987
I'm keeping $50. Call it interest.

287
00:24:56,654 --> 00:24:58,865
I'm really sorry about all this.

288
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:08,583
I just gave you a favour.

289
00:25:10,043 --> 00:25:12,420
Here I thought you just gave me head.

290
00:25:49,749 --> 00:25:50,583
Crown me.

291
00:25:57,423 --> 00:26:00,092
At the risk of sounding like,
you know...

292
00:26:00,342 --> 00:26:01,510
...me...

293
00:26:01,844 --> 00:26:03,888
...what'll you do about being evicted?

294
00:26:04,138 --> 00:26:05,514
Aren't you still short?

295
00:26:15,274 --> 00:26:16,275
What?

296
00:26:44,803 --> 00:26:46,430
I'm Kelly and this is Donna.

297
00:26:46,722 --> 00:26:49,016
We're wondering
if you wanna hang out.

298
00:26:51,435 --> 00:26:53,645
I think I feel something.

299
00:26:54,313 --> 00:26:56,440
It's really smooth, isn't it?

300
00:26:57,065 --> 00:27:00,652
Donna's brother here is a pharmacist,
so he got it for us.

301
00:27:03,947 --> 00:27:06,533
His name's Chip. My brother.

302
00:27:09,202 --> 00:27:11,747
Is it like a wave?

303
00:27:12,581 --> 00:27:14,207
Or is it like a zoom?

304
00:27:14,541 --> 00:27:16,084
It's like...

305
00:27:16,626 --> 00:27:18,587
...floating.

306
00:27:18,879 --> 00:27:19,880
Like...

307
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:24,593
..." Hey, man, how's the ground
down there?" and shit.

308
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:25,677
I got it.

309
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:29,139
Holy shit!

310
00:27:29,389 --> 00:27:31,099
Fuck, yeah!

311
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,560
Shit!

312
00:27:35,895 --> 00:27:36,896
It's really that cool?

313
00:27:37,188 --> 00:27:41,651
Man, you gotta try this shit.
I'll buy it for you.

314
00:27:42,694 --> 00:27:44,571
You know what makes it even better?

315
00:27:45,071 --> 00:27:47,824
If you take, like,
a lot of pot with it.

316
00:27:48,116 --> 00:27:50,577
I mean, like, a lot of pot.

317
00:27:50,952 --> 00:27:53,496
I can't believe
you're selling allergy medicine.

318
00:27:53,747 --> 00:27:57,250
We're out of that.
We're down to chewable aspirin.

319
00:27:58,501 --> 00:28:02,881
Some people are saying
that you got some really good stuff.

320
00:28:03,965 --> 00:28:05,592
Show me your tits.

321
00:28:21,941 --> 00:28:23,317
So how much have you made?

322
00:28:23,776 --> 00:28:25,570
Four hundred.

323
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:57,494
Where'd you get it?

324
00:29:57,744 --> 00:30:00,205
This girl inside.
She and her friend had it.

325
00:30:00,455 --> 00:30:02,165
Ecstasy. The real shit?

326
00:30:02,416 --> 00:30:03,792
Pharmaceutical grade.

327
00:30:04,042 --> 00:30:06,169
None of the crunchy, herbal rave shit.

328
00:30:06,461 --> 00:30:08,922
Best 20 bucks you could spend.

329
00:31:11,484 --> 00:31:12,652
What's wrong?

330
00:31:13,194 --> 00:31:14,821
I can't feel my hands.

331
00:31:16,114 --> 00:31:17,574
Jesus, you're burning up.

332
00:31:18,449 --> 00:31:20,410
I can't carry you, okay?

333
00:31:24,122 --> 00:31:25,373
I'm leaving you here.

334
00:31:26,165 --> 00:31:27,875
I'm gonna go get the car.

335
00:31:28,167 --> 00:31:31,003
All right? Just hide here, okay?

336
00:31:31,254 --> 00:31:32,422
Just like a little mouse.

337
00:31:32,714 --> 00:31:37,593
I'm gonna get the car, then come
back for you. I'll see you soon, okay?

338
00:32:00,866 --> 00:32:02,493
How are sales?

339
00:32:06,497 --> 00:32:07,331
I can explain.

340
00:32:07,623 --> 00:32:09,083
I'm not gonna ask you to.

341
00:32:10,376 --> 00:32:12,753
It's not a highly ethical industry.

342
00:32:13,003 --> 00:32:16,090
But goddamn, you fucked me over
for 20 lousy hits.

343
00:32:19,343 --> 00:32:23,556
It's not what it looks like.
It sort of is, but it's complicated.

344
00:32:23,806 --> 00:32:25,182
Not really.

345
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:28,644
I know I fucked up, okay?
Please...

346
00:32:28,894 --> 00:32:30,145
...I can make it up to you.

347
00:32:30,437 --> 00:32:33,107
I'm the last person
you should ask a favour from.

348
00:32:33,357 --> 00:32:34,900
I have the money.

349
00:32:35,776 --> 00:32:37,152
I have more than I owe you.

350
00:32:37,403 --> 00:32:39,196
So now you're an entrepreneur.

351
00:34:07,408 --> 00:34:09,452
Jalisco? Where's Jalisco?

352
00:34:09,994 --> 00:34:10,912
In Mexico.

353
00:34:13,915 --> 00:34:16,751
Simon, no one is going
to take your shift.

354
00:34:20,755 --> 00:34:23,675
Nothing brings back
warm holiday memories like...

355
00:34:24,133 --> 00:34:24,968
Don't.

356
00:34:25,218 --> 00:34:26,052
Why not?

357
00:34:26,636 --> 00:34:28,763
Because she's been on for 14 hours.

358
00:34:30,765 --> 00:34:32,392
- Ronna.
- No.

359
00:34:32,642 --> 00:34:34,602
- I didn't ask yet.
- The answer's no.

360
00:34:34,894 --> 00:34:36,688
Christmas is a time for giving.

361
00:34:36,979 --> 00:34:38,231
Mistletoe?

362
00:34:41,859 --> 00:34:43,653
- How much you owe?
- $380.

363
00:34:43,945 --> 00:34:45,905
- That's nothing.
- It's more than I got.

364
00:34:46,155 --> 00:34:47,073
Want my shift?

365
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:52,370
My best mates are going
to Las Vegas this weekend.

366
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:54,997
I've never been.
I'm told it's incredible.

367
00:34:55,248 --> 00:34:59,293
If you take my shift,
I can go with them. Everybody wins.

368
00:35:00,836 --> 00:35:02,463
Cash up front?

369
00:35:04,924 --> 00:35:05,925
Deal.

370
00:35:08,302 --> 00:35:10,262
I'll give you an extra $20
for a blowjob.

371
00:35:21,232 --> 00:35:23,609
Fucking let me out of here!

372
00:35:34,954 --> 00:35:36,038
What?

373
00:35:36,664 --> 00:35:38,374
Shut your big butt.

374
00:35:46,799 --> 00:35:48,509
Motherfucking jack-in-the-box!

375
00:35:48,842 --> 00:35:51,053
Dude, you passed out
before we left L.A.

376
00:35:53,764 --> 00:35:55,057
He still looks great.

377
00:35:55,516 --> 00:35:56,433
Watch out.

378
00:35:59,103 --> 00:35:59,937
Damn!

379
00:36:00,187 --> 00:36:01,814
Man, watch the kicks!

380
00:36:03,357 --> 00:36:05,234
That is nasty.

381
00:36:08,445 --> 00:36:09,530
Peep this.

382
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:13,909
This chick's bobbing up and down
on my dick like Marilyn Chambers...

383
00:36:14,159 --> 00:36:15,535
She found your dick?

384
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:20,040
Then she moves around the outside.
She's painting the tree.

385
00:36:20,332 --> 00:36:21,959
It hits her in the eye.

386
00:36:22,209 --> 00:36:26,046
And her contact? It's, like, stuck
on the end of my dick.

387
00:36:29,299 --> 00:36:32,135
Yo, her contact is stuck
on the end of my dick!

388
00:36:32,386 --> 00:36:33,637
Was it hard or soft?

389
00:36:33,845 --> 00:36:34,679
My dick?

390
00:36:34,888 --> 00:36:37,891
- The contact lens.
- Remember if it was coloured?

391
00:36:38,183 --> 00:36:39,976
That she had two blue eyes...

392
00:36:40,268 --> 00:36:42,312
...and now one blue and one brown?

393
00:36:42,604 --> 00:36:43,438
What does it matter?

394
00:36:44,523 --> 00:36:47,108
It matters because it happened to me.

395
00:36:47,442 --> 00:36:50,528
That was my story.
I told that story a year ago, man.

396
00:36:51,363 --> 00:36:54,449
The difference is I knew
those small details.

397
00:36:54,699 --> 00:36:56,910
That and my story was true.

398
00:36:59,204 --> 00:37:00,038
Whatever.

399
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:01,206
"Whatever"?

400
00:37:01,623 --> 00:37:02,457
Whatever.

401
00:37:02,707 --> 00:37:04,084
What do you mean?

402
00:37:04,376 --> 00:37:07,879
Pull your stinky dinky out of my ass!
I was making conversation.

403
00:37:08,129 --> 00:37:08,963
Fuck!

404
00:37:09,255 --> 00:37:10,799
Give a nigger a break!

405
00:37:11,091 --> 00:37:13,384
"Nigger"? What nigger, this nigger?

406
00:37:13,635 --> 00:37:16,387
I told you my mother's mother's
mother was black.

407
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:18,473
This ain't Roots.

408
00:37:18,765 --> 00:37:20,558
Show me this Nubian's picture.

409
00:37:20,808 --> 00:37:22,852
I don't carry her picture.

410
00:37:23,061 --> 00:37:25,021
If you were less black,
you'd be clear.

411
00:37:25,313 --> 00:37:26,689
She was black as night!

412
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,399
Okay, stop! Truce!

413
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:29,734
Shut up!

414
00:37:34,447 --> 00:37:35,698
Man, I see black.

415
00:37:35,948 --> 00:37:38,785
I know I am.
Colour's a state of mind, Marcus.

416
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:42,497
You know, you're right.
Thank you, Rhythm Nation.

417
00:37:42,747 --> 00:37:44,374
Fuck you, Vanilla Ice.

418
00:37:47,376 --> 00:37:49,587
So what does Valentina do?

419
00:37:49,879 --> 00:37:52,006
- Valentina's a nutritionist.
- Nice.

420
00:37:52,381 --> 00:37:55,218
She also teaches a class
at this college.

421
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:57,303
Class? What class?

422
00:37:57,762 --> 00:38:01,182
It's called
"Tantric Sexuality for Couples."

423
00:38:01,516 --> 00:38:03,392
She teaches people how to fuck?

424
00:38:04,268 --> 00:38:05,436
Yo, I taught myself.

425
00:38:06,354 --> 00:38:08,147
Yo, are you done yet, girl?

426
00:38:08,648 --> 00:38:10,524
That's a shrimp ass.

427
00:38:11,776 --> 00:38:13,819
That shrimp's full of iodine.

428
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:17,948
This shit's expensive. You're spending
$5 for lettuce and seeds.

429
00:38:18,657 --> 00:38:19,825
Damn!

430
00:38:23,788 --> 00:38:26,082
The thing is, most people...

431
00:38:26,373 --> 00:38:28,000
...don't know how to make love.

432
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:31,003
They stick it in, move it around
till they get off.

433
00:38:31,253 --> 00:38:34,173
But what Tantra teaches you
is how to deepen...

434
00:38:34,423 --> 00:38:36,383
...prolong the sexual experience.

435
00:38:36,675 --> 00:38:38,302
Bring it to a higher level.

436
00:38:38,552 --> 00:38:42,681
If one man in 10 was having the sex
I'm having, there'd be no war.

437
00:38:43,432 --> 00:38:45,643
What's the longest you two ever did it?

438
00:38:45,935 --> 00:38:47,811
- Fourteen hours.
- Holy shit!

439
00:38:48,062 --> 00:38:49,605
How many times you shoot?

440
00:38:49,855 --> 00:38:51,315
Not once, man.

441
00:38:52,608 --> 00:38:54,985
You didn't go once?
Not even at the end?

442
00:38:55,277 --> 00:38:57,321
You redirect the orgasm inside.

443
00:38:57,988 --> 00:39:00,991
How long do your orgasms last?
Two, three seconds?

444
00:39:02,618 --> 00:39:06,205
I've had orgasms that have lasted
up to an hour and a half.

445
00:39:06,497 --> 00:39:07,873
That's bullshit!

446
00:39:08,123 --> 00:39:09,917
Honest to God and I mean Allah.

447
00:39:10,167 --> 00:39:11,001
Word.

448
00:39:11,251 --> 00:39:12,169
- Word.
- Wait.

449
00:39:12,586 --> 00:39:14,463
- No love.
- When'd you last get off?

450
00:39:14,713 --> 00:39:17,549
I haven't ejaculated in six months.

451
00:39:21,136 --> 00:39:22,930
Anyone can do it.

452
00:39:23,138 --> 00:39:24,681
It just takes discipline.

453
00:39:24,932 --> 00:39:28,268
Bullshit. You're some
Obi-Wan Kenobi motherfucker.

454
00:39:28,685 --> 00:39:31,688
You call me old school.
I'm for coming and going.

455
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:35,317
Hour and a half.

456
00:39:39,279 --> 00:39:42,199
What the hell you doing with a gold...
Todd Gaines?

457
00:39:42,449 --> 00:39:44,159
The drug dealer.

458
00:39:44,576 --> 00:39:48,955
He gets a discount here.
He let me borrow it. He's a good guy.

459
00:39:49,206 --> 00:39:52,709
He's the good drug dealer. Right.
Sometimes I get confused.

460
00:39:53,001 --> 00:39:56,338
Relax, we're gonna pay cash.
That's just to get the room.

461
00:39:57,923 --> 00:39:58,840
Come on, Singh.

462
00:39:59,132 --> 00:40:01,801
I told you not to eat
those shrimp, didn't I?

463
00:40:02,093 --> 00:40:04,220
Todd, it's Simon.
What's up?

464
00:40:05,764 --> 00:40:07,640
I'm in Vegas. We just got here.

465
00:40:07,974 --> 00:40:10,643
What was the name of
that place you said we...

466
00:40:10,977 --> 00:40:12,520
Crazy Horse.

467
00:40:12,771 --> 00:40:14,814
Right. So what you up to tonight?

468
00:40:15,065 --> 00:40:16,441
Singh, come on now!

469
00:40:16,649 --> 00:40:17,901
Hold on, man.

470
00:40:26,034 --> 00:40:27,285
Damn, Singh!

471
00:40:28,578 --> 00:40:31,748
See, I told you not to eat
those shrimp, didn't I?

472
00:40:31,998 --> 00:40:33,249
You're going to a wedding?

473
00:40:33,541 --> 00:40:35,585
So what is it, like a rave?

474
00:40:36,628 --> 00:40:38,421
How's your stomach feel, Singh?

475
00:40:40,048 --> 00:40:41,758
No gambling for you.

476
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:43,134
I know Claire.

477
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,136
So you gonna fuck her?

478
00:40:50,224 --> 00:40:52,685
All I know is I plan
to get thoroughly laid.

479
00:40:52,935 --> 00:40:53,770
Who are you?

480
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:54,854
This is our room.

481
00:40:55,104 --> 00:40:56,481
What are you doing?

482
00:40:56,731 --> 00:40:58,191
Raping small children.

483
00:41:06,741 --> 00:41:09,285
Did I mention how much
I like your jacket?

484
00:41:16,626 --> 00:41:19,378
Bitch, look at your shirt.
This ain't Hawaii.

485
00:41:20,171 --> 00:41:21,088
Lend me some money.

486
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:23,341
- Man, where's your money?
- I lost it.

487
00:41:24,008 --> 00:41:25,468
We've been here five minutes.

488
00:41:25,718 --> 00:41:28,971
I played this game at a $100 table
and didn't understand it.

489
00:41:29,221 --> 00:41:31,265
Now I do.
I figured out how to beat it.

490
00:41:31,515 --> 00:41:33,309
Cool. Give me your wallet.

491
00:41:33,976 --> 00:41:34,810
Here you go.

492
00:41:35,561 --> 00:41:38,814
- What're you doing?
- Come back in an hour for it.

493
00:41:39,523 --> 00:41:43,360
In an hour, I'll give you your money.
Now get out. You're bad luck.

494
00:41:44,778 --> 00:41:46,989
Scram. Damn it!

495
00:42:07,634 --> 00:42:08,886
Darling?

496
00:42:28,822 --> 00:42:29,906
Hello.

497
00:42:30,782 --> 00:42:32,159
Cheers!

498
00:43:05,734 --> 00:43:07,193
Oh, my God!

499
00:43:13,074 --> 00:43:16,327
So if you're from over there...

500
00:43:16,619 --> 00:43:19,456
...then where did you meet
these friends of yours...

501
00:43:20,457 --> 00:43:22,083
...who I don't see?

502
00:43:24,085 --> 00:43:27,505
The others already knew each other.
I met Marcus in traffic school.

503
00:43:27,755 --> 00:43:29,632
In traffic school?

504
00:43:30,633 --> 00:43:32,510
Listen, I'm a good driver, I am.

505
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,971
I learned everything
from American television.

506
00:43:35,263 --> 00:43:36,097
Great.

507
00:43:36,306 --> 00:43:38,433
Hunter, Magnum P. I...

508
00:43:38,683 --> 00:43:40,560
Knight Rider is an excellent program.

509
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:44,647
Are you having a go at me here?

510
00:43:46,482 --> 00:43:48,109
Our stop.

511
00:43:55,074 --> 00:43:58,161
So do you want to be
getting high with us?

512
00:44:11,465 --> 00:44:13,593
Otherwise, I can't hold it in.

513
00:44:28,733 --> 00:44:29,567
Oh, my God!

514
00:44:29,817 --> 00:44:30,818
Oh, my God!

515
00:44:33,362 --> 00:44:35,072
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

516
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,700
- You're fine.
- I'm so bad!

517
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:40,953
- I don't know what I'm doing!
- Tell her she's fine!

518
00:44:41,662 --> 00:44:43,456
You're beautiful.

519
00:45:15,112 --> 00:45:16,905
Did you go?

520
00:45:21,076 --> 00:45:22,536
Why not?

521
00:45:25,038 --> 00:45:26,748
Tantra, baby.

522
00:46:17,924 --> 00:46:18,842
Sorry.

523
00:46:35,024 --> 00:46:36,651
Could you hand me a towel?

524
00:46:45,243 --> 00:46:46,619
Baby, what's up?

525
00:46:55,294 --> 00:46:58,131
I'm not a bathroom attendant!

526
00:46:59,048 --> 00:47:00,758
Redneck motherf...!

527
00:47:04,804 --> 00:47:05,721
Man, we're leaving.

528
00:47:06,013 --> 00:47:07,557
- Hell, yeah.
- Let's go.

529
00:47:17,024 --> 00:47:19,777
Keep it close and there's
an extra $10 for you.

530
00:47:24,448 --> 00:47:26,742
Get in the car. Get in.

531
00:47:51,725 --> 00:47:52,726
Shit! Look at this.

532
00:47:52,977 --> 00:47:54,520
Oh, my Lord!

533
00:47:56,397 --> 00:47:57,398
Don't point it at me.

534
00:47:57,648 --> 00:48:00,734
- How do I know if it's loaded?
- First, stop pointing it!

535
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:05,614
You know, I've never held
a real gun before.

536
00:48:05,906 --> 00:48:07,449
It's heavier than I thought.

537
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:09,076
Could you put it down, please?

538
00:48:09,326 --> 00:48:11,453
I wonder if it's loaded.

539
00:48:11,745 --> 00:48:13,205
How do you get this...

540
00:48:19,169 --> 00:48:20,879
I can't do it. It's stuck.

541
00:48:25,467 --> 00:48:27,344
Give me that gun! Take the wheel.

542
00:48:27,636 --> 00:48:30,013
Goddamn you!

543
00:48:32,516 --> 00:48:33,892
Take this.

544
00:48:38,981 --> 00:48:41,733
I hold 10 men's lives in my hand.

545
00:48:42,025 --> 00:48:43,235
It's a nine-millimetre.

546
00:48:43,902 --> 00:48:45,779
You don't have the stopping power.

547
00:48:46,071 --> 00:48:47,155
Right.

548
00:48:47,406 --> 00:48:49,616
For that, you'd need magnum force.

549
00:48:51,118 --> 00:48:52,494
- Easy, easy.

550
00:48:52,744 --> 00:48:56,248
They'll ask you if you want
to buy a bottle of champagne.

551
00:48:56,456 --> 00:48:57,290
- Don't.
- Explain.

552
00:48:57,541 --> 00:49:01,044
"Champagne" means a private dance.
We can't afford it.

553
00:49:01,336 --> 00:49:03,463
- "Champagne" is a code, right?
- Exactly.

554
00:49:03,755 --> 00:49:05,298
- What does "vodka" mean?
- Nothing.

555
00:49:05,590 --> 00:49:09,511
You can order anything you want
so long as it's not what?

556
00:49:09,803 --> 00:49:10,720
Champagne.

557
00:49:34,828 --> 00:49:36,204
What'll it be?

558
00:49:36,496 --> 00:49:39,124
Let me get a vodka tonic
and a beer, please.

559
00:50:05,817 --> 00:50:09,487
I'd like to buy your most expensive
bottle of champagne.

560
00:50:10,822 --> 00:50:11,906
Dumb ass!

561
00:50:20,498 --> 00:50:22,625
I need a major credit card.

562
00:50:29,015 --> 00:50:30,349
This is a gentlemen's club.

563
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:33,519
You are expected
to behave as gentlemen.

564
00:50:33,978 --> 00:50:35,229
I'll be giving you one rule.

565
00:50:35,479 --> 00:50:38,941
If you break this rule,
I will break your arm.

566
00:50:39,191 --> 00:50:40,359
Are we clear?

567
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:42,653
The ladies can touch you.

568
00:50:42,945 --> 00:50:46,949
You cannot touch the ladies
at any point, under any circumstance.

569
00:50:47,199 --> 00:50:49,368
- Is that clear?
- Crystal.

570
00:50:50,411 --> 00:50:51,871
Enjoy your evening.

571
00:51:02,548 --> 00:51:04,925
Have a seat right here, sexy.

572
00:51:07,094 --> 00:51:08,262
Just relax.

573
00:52:03,525 --> 00:52:05,277
Give it to me.

574
00:52:19,458 --> 00:52:20,500
God!

575
00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:23,420
Hands! Hands!

576
00:52:23,670 --> 00:52:25,797
Asshole!
Told you, don't touch us!

577
00:52:26,047 --> 00:52:28,967
- Jerk! Can't listen to shit!
- What did I tell you?

578
00:52:29,593 --> 00:52:31,636
What did I fucking tell you?!

579
00:52:31,886 --> 00:52:32,804
The other one!

580
00:52:35,307 --> 00:52:36,683
Take it easy, man!

581
00:52:38,810 --> 00:52:39,894
Am I talking to you?

582
00:52:40,145 --> 00:52:42,564
I'm talking to your
faggot friend here!

583
00:52:43,565 --> 00:52:46,860
- Stop fucking kicking him!
- Think you can beat my ass?

584
00:52:47,110 --> 00:52:48,027
Want a piece of this?

585
00:52:48,278 --> 00:52:49,821
Think you can beat my ass?

586
00:52:53,825 --> 00:52:55,785
Everybody back the fuck away!

587
00:53:01,958 --> 00:53:03,585
Is there another way out?

588
00:53:03,835 --> 00:53:05,211
Behind you. The door.

589
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:28,651
What are you doing?

590
00:53:28,901 --> 00:53:30,194
Getting rid of the weapon.

591
00:53:31,863 --> 00:53:33,614
It has your fingerprints on it.

592
00:53:42,748 --> 00:53:43,791
Do we answer?

593
00:53:45,293 --> 00:53:48,212
It's probably Orange County,
wondering where his car is.

594
00:53:48,462 --> 00:53:51,132
They can trace us
even if we don't answer.

595
00:53:51,382 --> 00:53:52,383
Go find the gun.

596
00:53:58,097 --> 00:54:00,307
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

597
00:54:08,023 --> 00:54:10,568
Just because some rapper's
got a white buddy...

598
00:54:10,818 --> 00:54:13,779
...doesn't mean that
he's Sidney fucking Poitier.

599
00:54:14,029 --> 00:54:15,406
You pat him down.

600
00:54:15,656 --> 00:54:17,491
You check him out.

601
00:54:17,741 --> 00:54:18,659
I know.

602
00:54:19,493 --> 00:54:23,038
You know what wakes me up at night,
covered in a cold sweat?

603
00:54:24,123 --> 00:54:28,711
Knowing you're no worse than anyone
else in your screwed-up generation.

604
00:54:29,545 --> 00:54:30,838
Give me a towel.

605
00:54:34,550 --> 00:54:36,343
In the old days...

606
00:54:36,635 --> 00:54:38,762
...you know how you got to the top?

607
00:54:39,388 --> 00:54:42,391
By being better than
the guy ahead of you.

608
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:45,394
And how do you people get to the top?

609
00:54:45,686 --> 00:54:50,149
By being so fucking incompetent,
the guy ahead of you can't do his job.

610
00:54:50,399 --> 00:54:54,736
So he falls on his ass, and,
congratulations, you are now on top.

611
00:54:55,571 --> 00:54:59,199
And now the top is down here,
when it used to be up here...

612
00:54:59,908 --> 00:55:02,035
...and you don't even know
the difference.

613
00:55:03,578 --> 00:55:07,040
They said that
they're from Los Angeles.

614
00:55:09,876 --> 00:55:12,295
Then they must be staying somewhere.

615
00:55:12,754 --> 00:55:14,840
And I won't just teach you
how to play...

616
00:55:15,090 --> 00:55:18,510
...I'll show you how not to be
overwhelmed by the casino.

617
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:21,513
The noise, the dealer
and other players.

618
00:55:21,763 --> 00:55:25,684
I'm gonna show you what to do,
how to do it and when to do it.

619
00:55:28,019 --> 00:55:29,312
What?

620
00:55:30,230 --> 00:55:32,232
Room 660.

621
00:55:33,608 --> 00:55:34,651
Who was that?

622
00:55:36,736 --> 00:55:37,821
Some shit.

623
00:55:38,113 --> 00:55:39,572
I don't know.

624
00:55:44,953 --> 00:55:47,580
They're at the Riviera, room 660.

625
00:55:52,877 --> 00:55:53,837
Keep the change.

626
00:55:59,843 --> 00:56:00,927
Here we go.

627
00:56:09,394 --> 00:56:10,687
We got 30 seconds to get out!

628
00:56:10,937 --> 00:56:13,231
- Get up!
- Grab what you can!

629
00:56:13,481 --> 00:56:14,315
What the fuck?

630
00:56:14,566 --> 00:56:16,025
Get up, man!

631
00:56:16,276 --> 00:56:18,444
- Just do it now!
- What the fuck?

632
00:56:20,321 --> 00:56:21,990
What'd you guys do, man?

633
00:56:30,081 --> 00:56:31,707
Room service.

634
00:56:32,959 --> 00:56:33,876
It's them.

635
00:56:35,461 --> 00:56:36,796
Who's "them"?

636
00:56:38,923 --> 00:56:40,842
Kid! Kid, open the door.

637
00:56:44,303 --> 00:56:46,138
I'm really sorry about before...

638
00:56:46,389 --> 00:56:49,392
...but it'd be swell if you could
open the door right now!

639
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:50,434
Fuck you!

640
00:56:50,685 --> 00:56:51,519
Bitch!

641
00:57:00,403 --> 00:57:04,198
Look, I'm really sorry, but it'd be
swell if you'd open the door.

642
00:57:04,448 --> 00:57:05,282
It's an emergency.

643
00:57:05,533 --> 00:57:06,867
Open up the door, boy.

644
00:57:07,118 --> 00:57:08,619
Hundred bucks.

645
00:57:08,869 --> 00:57:09,703
Fuck!

646
00:57:09,912 --> 00:57:11,539
We gotta give him the money.

647
00:57:17,086 --> 00:57:18,254
- Tiny!
- Here's 10.

648
00:57:18,546 --> 00:57:20,548
Now, kid, open up the door.

649
00:57:20,798 --> 00:57:22,841
Open now. Open now!

650
00:57:24,009 --> 00:57:25,636
Come on, man.

651
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:27,721
Come on, buddy.

652
00:57:28,097 --> 00:57:30,099
Okay, you got the money.
Open the door.

653
00:57:40,818 --> 00:57:42,069
I don't feel well!

654
00:57:43,821 --> 00:57:44,655
What's going on?

655
00:57:44,863 --> 00:57:47,032
Someone tell me what's going on.

656
00:57:47,282 --> 00:57:49,785
What the fuck are we running from?

657
00:57:51,495 --> 00:57:52,955
- Get in.
- You get in!

658
00:57:53,205 --> 00:57:55,249
- Get in!
- I'm not getting in the back!

659
00:57:55,499 --> 00:57:57,125
Hey, come on!

660
00:58:10,472 --> 00:58:11,974
Get the car!

661
00:58:18,897 --> 00:58:20,816
Do you even know
how to drive this car?

662
00:58:21,066 --> 00:58:22,776
Of course I do. Don't be stupid.

663
00:58:23,026 --> 00:58:24,736
Damn! Watch what you're doing.

664
00:58:24,986 --> 00:58:26,363
Oh, my God!

665
00:58:27,447 --> 00:58:28,782
Hold up!

666
00:58:29,241 --> 00:58:30,659
Yo, Simon, slow down!

667
00:58:40,502 --> 00:58:41,753
Come on. Look at this.

668
00:58:42,087 --> 00:58:43,546
Come on!

669
00:58:46,758 --> 00:58:47,968
They're right behind us.

670
00:58:48,218 --> 00:58:49,094
Who?

671
00:58:50,679 --> 00:58:51,638
Shit!

672
00:59:31,177 --> 00:59:33,054
You're making me sick again, man.

673
00:59:44,315 --> 00:59:45,775
Let me out!

674
00:59:51,614 --> 00:59:52,823
Cop, cop, cop!

675
01:00:14,095 --> 01:00:14,970
It's them.

676
01:00:18,099 --> 01:00:19,892
How did they find us?

677
01:00:22,436 --> 01:00:24,063
It's their town.

678
01:00:24,313 --> 01:00:25,940
They have people.

679
01:00:54,802 --> 01:00:56,220
Get off this street.

680
01:00:56,470 --> 01:00:57,846
- Hold on!
- Wait!

681
01:00:58,096 --> 01:00:59,014
Not here! Wait!

682
01:01:05,312 --> 01:01:06,605
What the fuck?

683
01:01:09,733 --> 01:01:11,193
I don't see them.

684
01:01:14,237 --> 01:01:16,031
Wait! They're coming in!

685
01:01:18,784 --> 01:01:20,285
All right, we can do this!

686
01:01:21,912 --> 01:01:22,913
We can do it!

687
01:01:41,348 --> 01:01:43,266
Let's gut this motherfucker!

688
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:58,323
Are you happy now?

689
01:01:58,573 --> 01:01:59,574
Shut up, man!

690
01:01:59,824 --> 01:02:01,743
Is your British ass happy now?

691
01:02:07,415 --> 01:02:08,792
Come on, man!

692
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:12,504
- They're gonna kill us!
- Shit!

693
01:03:03,930 --> 01:03:06,307
You son of a bitch!

694
01:03:10,645 --> 01:03:11,604
Man!

695
01:03:12,813 --> 01:03:14,857
Will you get out of there?

696
01:03:20,112 --> 01:03:22,073
- Just so we're clear.

697
01:03:23,157 --> 01:03:24,742
You stole a car...

698
01:03:24,992 --> 01:03:26,577
...shot a bouncer...

699
01:03:26,827 --> 01:03:28,787
...and had sex with two women?

700
01:03:30,122 --> 01:03:32,082
You had sex with two women?

701
01:03:32,333 --> 01:03:33,375
Here's the plan.

702
01:03:33,667 --> 01:03:35,127
We can be in Mexico by noon.

703
01:03:35,377 --> 01:03:37,213
We'll split up. I'll take Baja.

704
01:03:37,463 --> 01:03:39,173
Fuck the plan. Fuck Mexico!

705
01:03:39,423 --> 01:03:41,800
We're going back home to L.A.

706
01:03:43,802 --> 01:03:45,262
Simon, think about it.

707
01:03:45,471 --> 01:03:48,307
If they wanted the cops,
they would've called in Vegas.

708
01:03:48,557 --> 01:03:50,768
They wanted us gone
and we're gone.

709
01:03:51,018 --> 01:03:52,144
It's over.

710
01:03:54,021 --> 01:03:56,106
You had sex with two women?

711
01:03:58,150 --> 01:03:59,485
Yeah, Tommy, it's Vic.

712
01:03:59,818 --> 01:04:01,945
I need you to run a credit card.

713
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:06,074
You ready?

714
01:04:06,492 --> 01:04:08,118
First name, Todd.

715
01:04:08,368 --> 01:04:11,538
Last name, Gaines. G-A-l-N-E-S.

716
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:22,758
- Which brings you all your holiday
favourites in one wonderful collection.

717
01:04:24,509 --> 01:04:25,344
Don't.

718
01:04:25,719 --> 01:04:26,553
Why not?

719
01:04:26,845 --> 01:04:29,556
Because she's been on for 14 hours.

720
01:04:30,557 --> 01:04:32,309
- Ronna.
- No.

721
01:04:32,559 --> 01:04:34,895
- I haven't asked yet.
- The answer's no.

722
01:04:35,103 --> 01:04:36,772
Maybe you forget, detective.

723
01:04:37,063 --> 01:04:39,524
I was cleared of all charges.

724
01:04:42,569 --> 01:04:45,363
I don't care how many lawyers
you bring in.

725
01:04:45,614 --> 01:04:48,992
Eden Valley will never stand
for your kind of scum.

726
01:05:12,557 --> 01:05:13,933
You work out, don't you?

727
01:05:16,811 --> 01:05:18,813
We have to. It's in the contract.

728
01:05:19,355 --> 01:05:21,274
No, no, you got a great body.

729
01:05:21,524 --> 01:05:23,443
Hey, people in here!

730
01:05:24,777 --> 01:05:28,072
Look, Burke, just so we're
clear on this...

731
01:05:28,448 --> 01:05:32,035
...even if you don't get this guy today,
charges are dropped, right?

732
01:05:32,285 --> 01:05:34,704
If a guy's concerned about
the legal process...

733
01:05:34,954 --> 01:05:37,457
...how come he gets busted
for possession?

734
01:05:40,418 --> 01:05:43,963
Relax. I'll sign the form,
and the whole thing goes away.

735
01:05:50,261 --> 01:05:52,638
Is it safe to have a radio
against my balls?

736
01:05:52,930 --> 01:05:54,182
It's safe enough.

737
01:05:55,975 --> 01:05:58,060
Starlight, star bright...

738
01:05:58,936 --> 01:06:00,605
...first star that I see tonight.

739
01:06:00,938 --> 01:06:02,398
I wish I may, I wish l...

740
01:06:02,648 --> 01:06:04,317
That's good. I'm getting him.

741
01:06:16,746 --> 01:06:18,581
What does your girlfriend look like?

742
01:06:20,291 --> 01:06:22,960
Five foot eight, brown hair, blue eyes.

743
01:06:25,254 --> 01:06:26,088
Hot?

744
01:06:26,464 --> 01:06:27,423
Hot? Yeah.

745
01:06:28,883 --> 01:06:29,925
Is she faithful?

746
01:06:30,384 --> 01:06:32,052
No. I don't think so.

747
01:06:32,344 --> 01:06:33,179
You faithful?

748
01:06:35,222 --> 01:06:36,640
Not anymore, no.

749
01:06:48,902 --> 01:06:51,113
Zack's girlfriend
is fucking around on him.

750
01:06:52,197 --> 01:06:55,159
Man, that sucks.
How'd you find out?

751
01:06:59,079 --> 01:07:01,165
No big deal.
I don't wanna get into it.

752
01:07:01,415 --> 01:07:02,249
Come on. Spill it.

753
01:07:02,541 --> 01:07:03,959
Absolutely. Tell us.

754
01:07:05,002 --> 01:07:07,671
Okay. I found socks.

755
01:07:08,380 --> 01:07:11,467
You know the socks
with elastic around the ankle...

756
01:07:11,717 --> 01:07:13,343
...to keep it from stretching out?

757
01:07:13,677 --> 01:07:15,596
All my socks have that.

758
01:07:15,888 --> 01:07:19,808
One day, I went into the drawer
and there was a pair that didn't.

759
01:07:20,058 --> 01:07:21,351
- So...
- You hear that?

760
01:07:22,060 --> 01:07:24,271
We got John Sherlock Holmes in here.

761
01:07:24,688 --> 01:07:26,690
You've been fucking around too.

762
01:07:27,316 --> 01:07:28,525
Only after I found out.

763
01:07:48,587 --> 01:07:52,007
So, Zack, do you know
who your girlfriend's fucking?

764
01:07:52,257 --> 01:07:53,592
No, Adam, I do not.

765
01:07:53,842 --> 01:07:57,596
Although I have suspicions,
mostly ex-boyfriends who keep calling.

766
01:07:58,221 --> 01:07:59,848
What a coincidence.

767
01:08:00,098 --> 01:08:02,976
I have the exact same problem
with my girlfriend.

768
01:08:03,977 --> 01:08:05,270
Isn't it ironic?

769
01:08:05,770 --> 01:08:07,063
Don't you think?

770
01:08:07,939 --> 01:08:10,400
Maybe I should start
checking for socks too.

771
01:08:16,406 --> 01:08:18,074
Gay men are so hot.

772
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:21,161
It's tragic.

773
01:08:31,629 --> 01:08:32,714
He's not here.

774
01:08:33,756 --> 01:08:35,508
What should we do? He's not here.

775
01:08:35,758 --> 01:08:37,260
We're gonna ask.

776
01:08:37,844 --> 01:08:39,387
You're gonna ask. Come on.

777
01:08:39,637 --> 01:08:40,722
Why me?

778
01:08:40,972 --> 01:08:44,225
You're more wholesome.
Just get up there and improv.

779
01:08:44,475 --> 01:08:46,227
There's an opera about him.

780
01:08:46,477 --> 01:08:47,687
X erxes.

781
01:08:47,937 --> 01:08:50,857
I took Music Appreciation.
Twice.

782
01:08:59,115 --> 01:09:00,241
He wasn't there.

783
01:09:00,533 --> 01:09:03,411
- We heard. You guys were great.
- You did great.

784
01:09:03,661 --> 01:09:06,873
Now this chick, Ronna,
you think she can score?

785
01:09:07,165 --> 01:09:09,208
- Maybe.
- Yeah, definitely.

786
01:09:09,542 --> 01:09:12,920
Then that's all we need.
It's all connected. Circle of life.

787
01:09:18,301 --> 01:09:21,304
Now they're both going in.
What's up with that?

788
01:09:23,055 --> 01:09:26,100
If she gets the stuff, what?
You just arrest her?

789
01:09:26,350 --> 01:09:27,935
No, we try to bring her over.

790
01:09:28,185 --> 01:09:30,479
You see, we arrest her
and then what?

791
01:09:30,813 --> 01:09:32,523
One crack whore off the street.

792
01:09:34,024 --> 01:09:36,819
We cut her a deal
if she helps us get this guy.

793
01:09:38,028 --> 01:09:41,282
We cut him a deal to get the guy
above him. Like with you.

794
01:09:41,532 --> 01:09:44,201
Sooner or later,
everybody's working for The Man.

795
01:09:44,702 --> 01:09:46,203
You got that right.

796
01:09:46,495 --> 01:09:47,746
She's coming up.

797
01:09:49,331 --> 01:09:51,041
What if she's not a dealer?

798
01:09:51,250 --> 01:09:55,337
What if it's just one thing you pulled
her into? Isn't that entrapment?

799
01:09:55,587 --> 01:09:59,967
If she's dealing, she's a dealer.
Who cares if it's her first or last?

800
01:10:00,217 --> 01:10:03,137
Ronna, hon, we are fresh out of OJ.
Cerveza?

801
01:10:05,764 --> 01:10:07,808
We bought a bunch of orange juice.

802
01:10:08,058 --> 01:10:11,979
We just left it out in the car.
But I can run and get it.

803
01:10:12,229 --> 01:10:15,399
Zack tells me that you got 20 at $20.
Is that right?

804
01:10:17,818 --> 01:10:19,153
You got a bathroom?

805
01:10:20,195 --> 01:10:22,239
Yeah. Down the hall, on the right.

806
01:10:22,489 --> 01:10:24,157
Here, let me show you.

807
01:10:27,077 --> 01:10:28,412
Go!

808
01:10:44,010 --> 01:10:45,554
It's all yours.

809
01:10:46,638 --> 01:10:48,932
I shouldn't be
drinking beer, should I?

810
01:10:49,182 --> 01:10:50,642
I mean, being so...

811
01:10:50,892 --> 01:10:52,894
...you know, underage and all.

812
01:10:57,357 --> 01:10:59,651
That means move away from the door.

813
01:10:59,901 --> 01:11:01,528
Okay. Thank you.

814
01:11:10,912 --> 01:11:14,332
Watch how I twist his wrist away
while I put on the second cuff...

815
01:11:14,582 --> 01:11:16,001
...so he can't go after me.

816
01:11:16,584 --> 01:11:19,379
Right down like that. Boom!
Snap it on.

817
01:11:21,464 --> 01:11:23,716
I watch all these cop shows...

818
01:11:23,925 --> 01:11:26,428
...and they never do it right. Ever.

819
01:11:27,846 --> 01:11:29,347
Pisses me off.

820
01:11:30,515 --> 01:11:31,683
Spread them!

821
01:11:37,605 --> 01:11:39,357
Hey, feel the abs on this one.

822
01:11:39,649 --> 01:11:41,734
You could scrub laundry on these.

823
01:11:45,071 --> 01:11:46,114
What?

824
01:11:47,365 --> 01:11:48,533
Nothing.

825
01:11:50,076 --> 01:11:51,327
I'm just out of it.

826
01:11:51,577 --> 01:11:53,871
Have a merry Christmas.
It was good to meet you.

827
01:11:54,163 --> 01:11:55,748
All right. Noel.

828
01:11:58,918 --> 01:12:01,170
Whether you get something
on that guy or not...

829
01:12:01,379 --> 01:12:03,673
...we're done, right? We did our part.

830
01:12:03,881 --> 01:12:04,715
You did your part.

831
01:12:04,966 --> 01:12:07,218
Great!
Could you take off my handcuffs?

832
01:12:07,468 --> 01:12:11,013
There's something I wanted to
ask you guys. Sort of a...

833
01:12:11,264 --> 01:12:13,558
I don't know.
Sort of a proposition.

834
01:12:16,143 --> 01:12:18,396
You see, my wife and l...
Irene, she's my wife.

835
01:12:18,604 --> 01:12:22,525
We both work on Christmas, so we're
having Christmas dinner tonight.

836
01:12:22,775 --> 01:12:24,277
And I was thinking...

837
01:12:24,735 --> 01:12:26,988
...maybe you guys
want to eat dinner with us.

838
01:12:27,238 --> 01:12:29,240
My wife is great. You'll love her.

839
01:12:29,490 --> 01:12:31,701
Then I'll sign the paper.
How's that sound?

840
01:12:33,327 --> 01:12:34,245
Well...

841
01:12:49,468 --> 01:12:50,803
Hi. Sorry.

842
01:12:51,095 --> 01:12:52,096
Phone?

843
01:12:52,388 --> 01:12:53,305
Check my messages?

844
01:12:53,556 --> 01:12:54,473
Here.

845
01:13:36,473 --> 01:13:37,307
Sorry.

846
01:13:37,516 --> 01:13:39,893
No. Stay for a sec.
Here, smell this.

847
01:13:40,352 --> 01:13:41,853
What does that smell like?

848
01:13:42,104 --> 01:13:43,355
CK One, right?

849
01:13:43,689 --> 01:13:45,691
Right? But it's not.

850
01:13:47,484 --> 01:13:48,360
- Really?
- Yeah.

851
01:13:48,610 --> 01:13:51,238
I get this stuff
for half what that stuff costs.

852
01:13:52,155 --> 01:13:52,989
It's nice.

853
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:55,242
It's very nice. Here, try.

854
01:14:04,668 --> 01:14:05,961
It's down.

855
01:14:06,211 --> 01:14:07,754
So is the liner.

856
01:14:10,006 --> 01:14:11,216
It's really soft.

857
01:14:11,508 --> 01:14:12,342
Get on.

858
01:14:12,801 --> 01:14:16,388
Oh, no, no.
I gotta go help with dinner...

859
01:14:17,347 --> 01:14:18,848
- Hear that?
- Hear what?

860
01:14:19,140 --> 01:14:22,060
Exactly. Individually wrapped springs.
Top quality.

861
01:14:24,020 --> 01:14:26,314
I could do aerobics
and you wouldn't feel it.

862
01:14:26,564 --> 01:14:27,399
I bet I wouldn't.

863
01:14:27,607 --> 01:14:30,860
So, Zack, would you say
you're open to new things?

864
01:14:34,364 --> 01:14:35,865
Tell me something.

865
01:14:36,115 --> 01:14:40,537
When you kiss those girls, you're not
really kissing them, are you?

866
01:14:41,162 --> 01:14:43,289
Well, it's a stage kiss.

867
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:46,084
Your lips touch,
but there's no tongue.

868
01:14:46,626 --> 01:14:48,378
So there's no feeling?

869
01:14:48,628 --> 01:14:50,421
Nobody gets jealous?

870
01:14:50,922 --> 01:14:53,633
It's not real. It's only acting.

871
01:15:04,811 --> 01:15:06,729
See, now that...

872
01:15:07,772 --> 01:15:09,565
There was a tongue there.

873
01:15:10,274 --> 01:15:11,442
Honey?

874
01:15:12,610 --> 01:15:13,903
Red or white?

875
01:15:14,821 --> 01:15:16,489
Which goes with ham?

876
01:15:16,739 --> 01:15:17,990
White.

877
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:22,078
Fabulous.

878
01:15:23,079 --> 01:15:23,913
More wine?

879
01:15:25,081 --> 01:15:27,625
He doesn't want any more.
Unless he does. Do you?

880
01:15:29,293 --> 01:15:31,087
No, thank you. No, thank you.

881
01:15:32,088 --> 01:15:33,589
Sure.

882
01:15:38,219 --> 01:15:39,512
Look...

883
01:15:39,762 --> 01:15:41,347
...Burke, this is...

884
01:15:42,431 --> 01:15:45,392
This is really great.
This is wonderful. Thank you.

885
01:15:45,643 --> 01:15:47,019
You're welcome.

886
01:15:48,813 --> 01:15:50,564
I don't even know how to say this.

887
01:15:50,815 --> 01:15:53,275
I'm sorry, but I think
we have to leave soon...

888
01:15:53,526 --> 01:15:55,986
...because Adam's not feeling well.

889
01:15:58,447 --> 01:15:59,740
I don't.

890
01:15:59,990 --> 01:16:01,367
It's true.

891
01:16:03,994 --> 01:16:06,121
Well, if you gotta go...

892
01:16:06,372 --> 01:16:08,082
...then I understand.

893
01:16:09,333 --> 01:16:10,334
But...

894
01:16:11,293 --> 01:16:13,379
...well, Irene and I sort of...

895
01:16:14,088 --> 01:16:16,590
...had an ulterior motive
for inviting you here.

896
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:19,134
He makes it sound sinister.

897
01:16:19,343 --> 01:16:20,177
It's not.

898
01:16:20,427 --> 01:16:21,720
No, I don't...

899
01:16:21,970 --> 01:16:24,056
She's right. Okay.

900
01:16:25,682 --> 01:16:27,768
You've looked around our place.

901
01:16:28,769 --> 01:16:31,313
Where do you think we got
most of this stuff?

902
01:16:32,022 --> 01:16:33,607
Just guess.

903
01:16:35,359 --> 01:16:36,568
Come on.

904
01:16:42,491 --> 01:16:43,408
Sears?

905
01:16:43,659 --> 01:16:45,035
J.C. Penney?

906
01:16:47,829 --> 01:16:50,749
It's actually from
Confederated Products.

907
01:16:51,291 --> 01:16:54,044
Almost everything here
is from Confederated Products...

908
01:16:54,378 --> 01:16:57,672
...from the toilet paper
to the candles to the ham.

909
01:16:57,923 --> 01:16:59,841
- The wine.
- The wine, the wine.

910
01:17:00,133 --> 01:17:02,094
Even that cologne you liked.

911
01:17:02,511 --> 01:17:07,390
Confederated Products is a multilevel,
direct wholesaling company.

912
01:17:07,641 --> 01:17:10,227
Which means we don't
just sell the products.

913
01:17:10,477 --> 01:17:11,895
No sir-you-ree Bob!

914
01:17:12,145 --> 01:17:14,981
We recruit and manage teams
that work under us.

915
01:17:15,232 --> 01:17:16,858
Irene and I started eight months ago...

916
01:17:17,108 --> 01:17:19,569
...and already, we're pulling in
$50,000 a year.

917
01:17:19,903 --> 01:17:22,614
We're the number four distributor
in southern California.

918
01:17:22,864 --> 01:17:24,032
You got that one, babe.

919
01:17:24,282 --> 01:17:27,535
And by March,
we might be number three.

920
01:17:30,914 --> 01:17:35,168
As law enforcement officers, we can't
recruit distributors from the force.

921
01:17:35,418 --> 01:17:38,171
It's against the rules.
So what we do is...

922
01:17:38,421 --> 01:17:40,715
...we look for people
in other industries...

923
01:17:40,965 --> 01:17:43,468
Like the entertainment industry.

924
01:17:45,220 --> 01:17:46,888
Wait. Wait.

925
01:17:47,931 --> 01:17:49,974
You want us to sell Amway?

926
01:17:55,229 --> 01:17:57,941
It's Confederated Products.
It's a...

927
01:17:58,399 --> 01:18:00,151
It's a different company.

928
01:18:00,652 --> 01:18:02,945
It's a different quality of product.

929
01:18:05,740 --> 01:18:09,118
I have to do something terrifically
unwholesome after that.

930
01:18:09,535 --> 01:18:10,870
I need to bathe in sin.

931
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:13,623
With me, or one
of your other boyfriends?

932
01:18:15,291 --> 01:18:18,294
Okay, I have cheated on you
with exactly one guy.

933
01:18:18,544 --> 01:18:19,796
Ditto.

934
01:18:21,672 --> 01:18:22,715
Who?

935
01:18:25,968 --> 01:18:29,722
No, I won't tell you because
you'll freak out and it'll be drama.

936
01:18:29,972 --> 01:18:34,101
Bad, not funny, Roseanne kind of
drama. And I'm just not up for it.

937
01:18:36,646 --> 01:18:38,105
- I'll tell you mine.
- No.

938
01:18:38,397 --> 01:18:39,815
Why not?

939
01:18:41,442 --> 01:18:44,987
You can't wait to tell me, can you?
You're gloating.

940
01:18:45,654 --> 01:18:47,698
You think yours is better than mine.

941
01:18:47,948 --> 01:18:48,824
No, I don't.

942
01:18:49,116 --> 01:18:51,410
- It's Sean Connery, isn't it?
- Count of three.

943
01:18:51,660 --> 01:18:52,661
- Fine.
- One...

944
01:18:52,912 --> 01:18:54,747
- Wait, wait.
...two...

945
01:18:56,123 --> 01:18:57,166
Okay, fine.

946
01:18:57,458 --> 01:18:58,584
Count of three.

947
01:18:58,792 --> 01:18:59,627
One, two, three.

948
01:18:59,835 --> 01:19:01,587
- Jimmy...
- Jimmy in makeup.

949
01:19:13,515 --> 01:19:14,767
Is Jimmy here?

950
01:19:14,975 --> 01:19:17,811
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

951
01:19:18,062 --> 01:19:19,521
I'll call you back.

952
01:19:21,148 --> 01:19:23,609
Jimmy's not here right now.

953
01:19:24,276 --> 01:19:26,528
He went to this thing.

954
01:19:32,034 --> 01:19:33,118
I'll go get it.

955
01:19:37,372 --> 01:19:40,000
You two do know, don't you?

956
01:19:40,876 --> 01:19:42,211
We know.

957
01:19:44,838 --> 01:19:46,506
I take no responsibility.

958
01:19:46,757 --> 01:19:48,425
I was only an innocent bystander.

959
01:19:48,675 --> 01:19:51,136
But there was this one time,
you guys...

960
01:19:51,386 --> 01:19:54,264
...you missed each other by,
like, three minutes.

961
01:19:54,514 --> 01:19:56,433
It was so exciting!

962
01:20:06,401 --> 01:20:08,695
It's some sort of rave thing.

963
01:20:17,704 --> 01:20:20,999
The thing about Jimmy,
the sex wasn't even that good.

964
01:20:21,249 --> 01:20:23,001
And that ear thing?

965
01:20:23,376 --> 01:20:26,087
I have Q-tips.
That's not necessary, thank you.

966
01:20:26,338 --> 01:20:29,049
The one thing I will give him
credit for is the oral.

967
01:20:29,299 --> 01:20:32,469
- The oral was good.
- What do you mean? He was terrible.

968
01:20:32,719 --> 01:20:35,764
At one point, I had to stop him
and correct his bad technique.

969
01:20:36,014 --> 01:20:40,310
I actually grabbed him by his ears
and retrained him from the throat up.

970
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:41,770
When was that?

971
01:20:42,187 --> 01:20:44,230
I don't know. October, maybe?

972
01:20:45,565 --> 01:20:48,234
Early October,
he suddenly got so much better.

973
01:21:13,217 --> 01:21:14,719
Hi, cowboy.

974
01:21:17,889 --> 01:21:19,640
Hi, asshole.

975
01:21:20,308 --> 01:21:21,309
Stop!

976
01:21:34,447 --> 01:21:36,616
I think you wanna follow that guy out.

977
01:21:36,949 --> 01:21:37,992
What?

978
01:21:41,579 --> 01:21:43,956
Where'd you learn to drive?
Circleville?

979
01:21:44,415 --> 01:21:46,417
I didn't pack a bag.

980
01:21:50,129 --> 01:21:51,255
What the...?

981
01:22:04,894 --> 01:22:05,811
Stop!

982
01:22:16,989 --> 01:22:18,115
Go. Go.

983
01:22:18,365 --> 01:22:19,283
What if she's...?

984
01:22:20,993 --> 01:22:21,994
Go!

985
01:22:47,227 --> 01:22:51,231
Let's think about this logically.
She's either alive or she's dead.

986
01:22:51,398 --> 01:22:53,525
All right, if she's dead...

987
01:22:54,401 --> 01:22:55,694
...there's nothing we can do.

988
01:22:55,944 --> 01:22:58,739
And if she's alive,
that guy who had that gun...

989
01:22:58,989 --> 01:23:01,575
...who looked like
he wanted to shoot her...

990
01:23:01,825 --> 01:23:03,910
...he probably did shoot her.

991
01:23:05,037 --> 01:23:06,496
So...

992
01:23:06,747 --> 01:23:09,958
...even if she's alive, she's dead.
- Exactly.

993
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:11,918
Exactly.

994
01:23:16,715 --> 01:23:18,717
The only witnesses
are you, me and him.

995
01:23:18,967 --> 01:23:22,679
I don't think any of us will talk
about this anytime soon, so...

996
01:23:23,013 --> 01:23:24,180
I really...

997
01:23:24,431 --> 01:23:26,558
It really didn't go
as bad as it could've.

998
01:23:29,811 --> 01:23:32,022
A girl is dead.

999
01:23:34,232 --> 01:23:36,901
I didn't say it went perfectly.

1000
01:24:00,174 --> 01:24:01,926
911 emergency.

1001
01:24:42,550 --> 01:24:43,843
What's up?

1002
01:24:48,848 --> 01:24:50,558
Holy shit!

1003
01:24:58,566 --> 01:25:00,192
They couldn't have been listening.

1004
01:25:00,443 --> 01:25:02,486
Hello?
They could've been recording it.

1005
01:25:02,736 --> 01:25:05,281
Everything we've said
would be on tape...

1006
01:25:05,531 --> 01:25:06,991
...and they'd know we did it.

1007
01:25:11,453 --> 01:25:14,081
What if we were, like,
running lines or something?

1008
01:25:14,331 --> 01:25:17,459
We could've been rehearsing.
They know we're actors.

1009
01:25:22,131 --> 01:25:25,259
Okay, there's a good chance
no one's found the girl yet.

1010
01:25:25,509 --> 01:25:26,552
They will.

1011
01:25:26,802 --> 01:25:29,013
If there's no body, there's no crime.

1012
01:25:37,855 --> 01:25:39,189
- Stop! Stop it!
- What?

1013
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:40,691
- What?
- It's a Miata.

1014
01:25:42,025 --> 01:25:43,777
We'll put her in the passenger seat.

1015
01:25:44,027 --> 01:25:44,945
Where will I...?

1016
01:25:45,195 --> 01:25:47,781
You'll be in the passenger seat
holding her up.

1017
01:26:04,131 --> 01:26:05,549
All right.

1018
01:26:17,060 --> 01:26:18,437
Little help?

1019
01:26:20,230 --> 01:26:21,106
I can't.

1020
01:26:22,190 --> 01:26:23,108
What do you mean?

1021
01:26:23,358 --> 01:26:25,360
I can't do this. I can't do this.

1022
01:26:25,610 --> 01:26:26,695
- Listen.
- She's dead.

1023
01:26:26,945 --> 01:26:28,196
- Listen.
- She's dead.

1024
01:26:29,322 --> 01:26:30,907
- She's not dead!
- She's dead.

1025
01:26:31,157 --> 01:26:33,076
I hit her and killed her.
She's dead.

1026
01:26:33,326 --> 01:26:35,203
She's not dead. She's acting dead.

1027
01:26:35,453 --> 01:26:37,205
Listen, this is just a scene.

1028
01:26:37,455 --> 01:26:39,082
You're just acting scared.

1029
01:26:39,332 --> 01:26:41,001
I'm acting like I'm helping her.

1030
01:26:41,251 --> 01:26:43,253
It's a scene. Look at the lights.

1031
01:26:43,503 --> 01:26:46,172
We're acting. Look at the camera.
Watch it.

1032
01:26:46,423 --> 01:26:49,551
Watch your blocking.
Say hi to Molly in wardrobe.

1033
01:26:49,801 --> 01:26:51,636
- Hi, Molly.
- Say it. "Hi, Molly."

1034
01:26:51,886 --> 01:26:53,721
Hi, Molly.

1035
01:26:53,972 --> 01:26:57,851
Craft services are here, and they're
making those veggie burgers you love.

1036
01:26:58,101 --> 01:27:02,230
You can have as many as you want.
Just help me get through this scene.

1037
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:05,191
Just help me get through this scene.
That's it.

1038
01:27:05,441 --> 01:27:07,443
Smell them. Smell them.

1039
01:27:07,694 --> 01:27:11,030
Smell the veggie burgers.
Can you smell them?

1040
01:27:11,281 --> 01:27:12,699
I'm not delusional!

1041
01:27:12,949 --> 01:27:15,493
Then grab her fucking arms!

1042
01:27:35,304 --> 01:27:37,849
- She's not dead.
- No shit!

1043
01:27:41,853 --> 01:27:43,855
If she isn't dead,
then we didn't kill her.

1044
01:27:44,105 --> 01:27:46,023
- We can leave her.
- She's almost dead.

1045
01:27:46,274 --> 01:27:48,776
If we leave her and she dies,
why'd we come back?

1046
01:27:49,026 --> 01:27:50,236
You still killed her.

1047
01:27:50,486 --> 01:27:51,320
I killed her?

1048
01:27:51,529 --> 01:27:53,698
Come on, I didn't mean it like that.

1049
01:27:53,948 --> 01:27:56,492
It's not like I'd ever
testify against you.

1050
01:27:58,285 --> 01:27:59,453
Let's stick to plan A.

1051
01:27:59,704 --> 01:28:01,956
What? In plan A, she was dead.

1052
01:28:10,673 --> 01:28:12,508
Wait. What...?

1053
01:28:27,815 --> 01:28:29,525
Okay, new plan.

1054
01:28:36,657 --> 01:28:38,033
Man, that's Kelly.

1055
01:28:38,826 --> 01:28:40,661
Somebody beat the crap out of her.

1056
01:28:41,328 --> 01:28:43,330
Can somebody call an ambulance?

1057
01:28:51,505 --> 01:28:52,548
Look.

1058
01:28:52,881 --> 01:28:55,634
They're getting her an ambulance.
She'll be fine.

1059
01:28:55,926 --> 01:28:58,470
It's good. Good.
She's gonna be fine.

1060
01:28:59,263 --> 01:29:00,973
What about that guy?

1061
01:29:01,431 --> 01:29:03,934
With the gun.
He could still go after her.

1062
01:29:04,893 --> 01:29:07,312
Hello? Look, girl in ditch:
Our problem.

1063
01:29:07,521 --> 01:29:09,439
Girl out of ditch:
Her problem.

1064
01:29:09,690 --> 01:29:11,858
Sorry. Look, we did the right thing.

1065
01:29:13,860 --> 01:29:16,697
What? Okay, approximately.

1066
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:21,368
In a half-assed, thrown-together,
bouillabaisse-y kind of way...

1067
01:29:21,618 --> 01:29:23,245
...we did the right thing.

1068
01:29:23,912 --> 01:29:25,122
Right?

1069
01:29:27,374 --> 01:29:28,834
She's fine.

1070
01:29:30,919 --> 01:29:31,962
Right.

1071
01:30:08,957 --> 01:30:11,793
- Just sit anywhere you want.
- Actually, I'm...

1072
01:30:12,043 --> 01:30:13,586
...meeting people.

1073
01:30:48,913 --> 01:30:50,706
Have you seen Ronna or Mannie?

1074
01:30:51,749 --> 01:30:53,000
We're twins.

1075
01:30:56,087 --> 01:30:57,838
Coffee. Here you go.

1076
01:31:00,007 --> 01:31:03,135
We meet here after we go out,
in case we get separated.

1077
01:31:06,347 --> 01:31:07,473
I'm sorry.

1078
01:31:10,184 --> 01:31:12,186
Thanks for buying me breakfast.

1079
01:31:17,024 --> 01:31:19,360
Unless you wanna sit alone,
I can...

1080
01:31:19,902 --> 01:31:21,153
No.

1081
01:31:23,364 --> 01:31:24,615
Fine.

1082
01:31:25,366 --> 01:31:27,409
See, I knew you weren't all evil.

1083
01:31:35,417 --> 01:31:37,628
What do you have against
The Family Circus?

1084
01:31:39,088 --> 01:31:40,464
You read your paper...

1085
01:31:40,714 --> 01:31:43,550
...and you're enjoying
your two-page comic spread.

1086
01:31:44,843 --> 01:31:47,012
And there's The Family
fucking Circus...

1087
01:31:47,262 --> 01:31:49,640
...bottom right corner,
just waiting to suck.

1088
01:31:49,890 --> 01:31:52,351
And that's the last thing
you read, so...

1089
01:31:52,601 --> 01:31:54,895
...it spoils everything
you read before it.

1090
01:31:56,814 --> 01:31:58,649
You could just not read it.

1091
01:32:00,567 --> 01:32:03,820
I hate it, yet I'm
uncontrollably drawn to it.

1092
01:32:04,154 --> 01:32:05,364
Are you gonna...?

1093
01:32:17,167 --> 01:32:18,710
You know what I like about you?

1094
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:21,963
And it's not your face.
You're only medium-cute.

1095
01:32:23,006 --> 01:32:24,674
But I think it's...

1096
01:32:25,133 --> 01:32:27,469
...you're the first non-fake
person I've met here.

1097
01:32:27,719 --> 01:32:29,054
It's kind of nice.

1098
01:32:29,721 --> 01:32:32,224
Professional curiosity:
What are you on?

1099
01:32:32,474 --> 01:32:34,935
- I'm serious.
- So am I. What are you on?

1100
01:32:35,977 --> 01:32:37,687
Ginseng and Dexatrim.

1101
01:32:44,402 --> 01:32:46,738
You know what I like best
about Christmas?

1102
01:32:47,113 --> 01:32:48,406
The surprises.

1103
01:32:48,657 --> 01:32:51,868
You get this box and you're sure
you know what's inside.

1104
01:32:52,118 --> 01:32:54,871
You shake it, weigh it,
convinced you have it pegged.

1105
01:32:55,121 --> 01:32:56,498
No doubt in your mind.

1106
01:32:56,831 --> 01:32:59,167
But then you open it up,
and it's different.

1107
01:32:59,417 --> 01:33:01,544
You know. Wow! Bang! Surprise!

1108
01:33:01,795 --> 01:33:04,255
It's kind of like
you and me here, you know?

1109
01:33:04,506 --> 01:33:06,716
I'm not saying it's anything it's not.

1110
01:33:08,718 --> 01:33:11,638
Come on, this time yesterday,
who would've thunk it?

1111
01:33:55,890 --> 01:33:57,391
How'd you get out?

1112
01:34:02,647 --> 01:34:05,107
Well, isn't this romantic?

1113
01:34:12,948 --> 01:34:15,201
Simon's apartment is here.

1114
01:34:15,701 --> 01:34:18,746
On Orlando, just off of Third.

1115
01:34:18,996 --> 01:34:23,417
There's construction on La Cienega,
so you might wanna take Fairfax.

1116
01:34:23,876 --> 01:34:24,794
Well, thanks.

1117
01:34:25,044 --> 01:34:26,795
Why don't you drive them yourself?

1118
01:34:27,046 --> 01:34:28,964
You could help them pull the trigger.

1119
01:34:32,468 --> 01:34:36,055
Listen, I'm gonna need
to hide out here for a while...

1120
01:34:38,807 --> 01:34:39,975
Guys, guys.

1121
01:34:40,225 --> 01:34:41,393
Come on!

1122
01:34:46,398 --> 01:34:47,691
Don't let him kill me!

1123
01:34:47,983 --> 01:34:49,068
Do it!

1124
01:34:49,318 --> 01:34:51,403
Stop it!

1125
01:34:51,862 --> 01:34:53,072
Shut up!

1126
01:34:53,322 --> 01:34:54,531
Hello? Witness?

1127
01:34:54,782 --> 01:34:56,408
- You'll shoot us both?
- Shut up.

1128
01:34:56,617 --> 01:34:58,368
This little fuck shot my son.

1129
01:34:58,577 --> 01:34:59,411
In the arm.

1130
01:34:59,620 --> 01:35:02,414
So you'll shoot all of us?
What do you actually want?

1131
01:35:04,208 --> 01:35:05,334
Justice.

1132
01:35:12,049 --> 01:35:14,843
That should be the fleshiest bit,
right there.

1133
01:35:15,093 --> 01:35:17,638
So it should be okay if you hit that.

1134
01:35:23,268 --> 01:35:24,561
Right. Cheers.

1135
01:35:45,248 --> 01:35:46,082
I can't.

1136
01:35:48,001 --> 01:35:49,794
What do you mean, you can't?

1137
01:35:50,629 --> 01:35:52,547
You just pull the fucking trigger.

1138
01:35:52,797 --> 01:35:54,132
Pull the fucking trigger!

1139
01:35:54,382 --> 01:35:57,093
If he knows he'll be shot,
it's not the same thing.

1140
01:35:57,344 --> 01:35:58,762
Just point!
Shoot him!

1141
01:35:59,012 --> 01:35:59,846
I don't mind.

1142
01:36:00,096 --> 01:36:01,056
See? He don't mind.

1143
01:36:01,306 --> 01:36:03,892
If your mother could see you now.
You're disgusting!

1144
01:36:04,142 --> 01:36:05,060
Pull the trigger.

1145
01:36:05,310 --> 01:36:06,269
It's different.

1146
01:36:06,519 --> 01:36:07,854
No shit!

1147
01:36:08,897 --> 01:36:09,731
He shot you!

1148
01:36:09,981 --> 01:36:11,274
- Where you going?
- To work.

1149
01:36:11,524 --> 01:36:12,650
See? The girl's leaving.

1150
01:36:12,901 --> 01:36:13,985
See you later!

1151
01:36:20,867 --> 01:36:22,869
It's all right! I'm okay!

1152
01:37:02,825 --> 01:37:06,162
Things didn't go exactly as planned,
you know?

1153
01:37:11,709 --> 01:37:12,877
And where's Mannie?

1154
01:37:17,214 --> 01:37:18,841
Fuck me!

1155
01:37:48,579 --> 01:37:50,539
You look like shit.

1156
01:37:51,582 --> 01:37:52,958
Found them.

1157
01:37:56,336 --> 01:37:57,588
Let's go.

1158
01:38:06,972 --> 01:38:08,140
Here, I'll drive.

1159
01:38:12,644 --> 01:38:14,479
Do you have enough money
for your rent?

1160
01:38:14,730 --> 01:38:16,440
And 20 left over.

1161
01:38:16,815 --> 01:38:18,984
Maybe I'll open a savings account.

1162
01:38:24,239 --> 01:38:25,324
So...

1163
01:38:25,616 --> 01:38:27,743
...what are we doing
for New Year's?

1164
01:41:52,154 --> 01:41:53,196
A PaRaNoIdAnDrOiD Rip...
