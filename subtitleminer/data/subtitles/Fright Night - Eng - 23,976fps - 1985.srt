1
00:00:33,738 --> 00:00:35,614
What was that?

2
00:00:37,074 --> 00:00:39,994
Just a child of the night,
Jonathan.

3
00:00:43,122 --> 00:00:45,499
Come.

4
00:00:45,624 --> 00:00:48,544
sit here beside me
on the veranda.

5
00:00:57,928 --> 00:00:59,597
It's chilly out here.

6
00:00:59,805 --> 00:01:03,976
Oh, no, it isn't.

7
00:01:04,101 --> 00:01:05,436
It's beautiful.

8
00:01:07,938 --> 00:01:09,899
I love the night so.

9
00:01:13,277 --> 00:01:16,155
I've never seen you look
so beautiful before, Nina.

10
00:01:17,615 --> 00:01:20,117
so pale.

11
00:01:20,242 --> 00:01:22,036
so...

12
00:01:22,119 --> 00:01:23,579
Iuminescent.

13
00:01:24,705 --> 00:01:25,956
so...

14
00:01:26,082 --> 00:01:27,541
Yes?

15
00:01:29,001 --> 00:01:31,921
- Your lips are so red.
- Are they?

16
00:01:32,963 --> 00:01:35,466
Would you like to kiss them?

17
00:01:48,187 --> 00:01:51,732
Why are you looking at me
so strangely, Nina?

18
00:01:51,816 --> 00:01:54,026
Not you, Jonathan.

19
00:01:54,151 --> 00:01:55,569
Your neck.

20
00:01:58,322 --> 00:02:01,409
Has anyone ever told you...

21
00:02:01,534 --> 00:02:03,619
it was beautiful?

22
00:02:04,578 --> 00:02:07,081
- No.
- Come.

23
00:02:08,499 --> 00:02:11,419
Lay your head on my breast.

24
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,140
stop...

25
00:02:24,265 --> 00:02:26,142
you creature of the night!

26
00:02:32,189 --> 00:02:35,109
Who are you who interrupts
my nightly feeding?

27
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,196
I... am...

28
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,449
Peter Vincent...

29
00:02:41,574 --> 00:02:43,951
vampire killer!

30
00:02:49,498 --> 00:02:52,418
Keep away!
Keep away from me!

31
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,742
And now your host...

32
00:03:24,825 --> 00:03:26,744
Peter Vincent.

33
00:03:26,827 --> 00:03:28,913
Fright Night!

34
00:03:28,996 --> 00:03:31,499
This is Peter Vincent...

35
00:03:31,624 --> 00:03:34,835
bringing you
Fright Night Theatre.

36
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,755
Charley!
Peter Vincent's on.

37
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,673
Forget Peter Vincent.

38
00:03:39,757 --> 00:03:41,342
But you love him.

39
00:03:41,425 --> 00:03:43,427
But I love you more.

40
00:03:45,679 --> 00:03:50,684
Tonight's journey into horror is...

41
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:52,478
Blood Castle.

42
00:03:52,603 --> 00:03:55,272
It will keep you
on the edge of yourseat.

43
00:03:55,398 --> 00:03:57,775
- Stop it.
- I know it will.

44
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,111
It is one of my favourites.

45
00:04:00,194 --> 00:04:02,363
And for a very good reason.

46
00:04:02,488 --> 00:04:04,448
I star in it.

47
00:04:14,792 --> 00:04:16,794
Fright Night!

48
00:04:18,129 --> 00:04:21,132
Charley, I said stop it!

49
00:04:21,382 --> 00:04:24,468
Jesus, Amy,
give me a break!

50
00:04:24,719 --> 00:04:26,887
We've been going together
almost a year.

51
00:04:27,012 --> 00:04:29,473
All I ever hear is
"Charley, stop it."

52
00:04:34,186 --> 00:04:35,563
I'm sorry.

53
00:04:39,817 --> 00:04:41,402
Me too.

54
00:04:41,485 --> 00:04:43,571
I'm just scared, that's all.

55
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,377
Let's get into bed.

56
00:05:01,088 --> 00:05:02,965
You mean it?

57
00:05:39,877 --> 00:05:42,046
Charley...

58
00:05:42,171 --> 00:05:43,422
I'm ready.

59
00:05:43,547 --> 00:05:45,800
Amy, you're not gonna
believe this.

60
00:05:45,925 --> 00:05:48,636
There are two guys in theyard
carrying a coffin.

61
00:05:49,887 --> 00:05:52,306
We have pledged ourselves
to evil.

62
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:54,141
Sure.

63
00:05:54,266 --> 00:05:56,352
And they're on the moors,
right?

64
00:05:56,477 --> 00:05:58,854
- Amy, I'm serious.
- So am I.

65
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:01,065
Do you want to make love
or not?

66
00:06:06,153 --> 00:06:09,490
Amy, quick, come here.
You gotta see this.

67
00:06:13,452 --> 00:06:15,538
Okay, maybe it wasn't a coffin...

68
00:06:15,663 --> 00:06:17,915
but I saw two guys carrying
something into that house.

69
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,500
I don't understand you.

70
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:22,503
First you want to make love,
and then you don't.

71
00:06:23,754 --> 00:06:25,256
What's wrong?

72
00:06:26,173 --> 00:06:27,425
Nothing, Mom.

73
00:06:27,508 --> 00:06:29,009
Come in here, you two.

74
00:06:32,763 --> 00:06:35,141
Are you kids having
a lovers' spat?

75
00:06:35,266 --> 00:06:37,226
No, Mom.
Nothing like that.

76
00:06:37,351 --> 00:06:39,520
Well, there's nothing
wrong with it.

77
00:06:39,603 --> 00:06:41,522
The divorce rate is 76% higher...

78
00:06:41,605 --> 00:06:44,316
among couples who don't argue
before marriage.

79
00:06:44,442 --> 00:06:47,862
- We're in high school!
- Never hurts to plan ahead.

80
00:06:47,945 --> 00:06:52,783
Amy, will you remind your mother we're
playing poker at her house thisweekend?

81
00:06:52,867 --> 00:06:54,744
Yes, Mrs Brewster.

82
00:06:55,703 --> 00:06:57,246
Good night, Charley.

83
00:06:57,371 --> 00:06:59,040
Yeah, good night.

84
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:03,085
- Good night, Mrs Brewster.
- Good night.

85
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:04,754
Thanks for helping
with Charley's homework

86
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:06,297
Anytime.

87
00:07:07,965 --> 00:07:09,467
See you tomorrow, Charley?

88
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:18,934
Charley, that wasn't very nice,
not walking Amy to the front door.

89
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,895
There are people next door.

90
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:23,397
I guess the new owner's
moving in.

91
00:07:23,522 --> 00:07:25,608
- What new owner?
- Didn't I tell you?

92
00:07:25,733 --> 00:07:28,652
Bob Hoskins said he finally
got rid ofthe place.

93
00:07:28,736 --> 00:07:32,281
- Who'd he sell it to?
- Some fella who fixes up houses.

94
00:07:32,406 --> 00:07:34,367
Supposed to be very attractive.

95
00:07:34,492 --> 00:07:37,828
I just hope he knows what
he's getting into with this house.

96
00:07:37,912 --> 00:07:40,081
It's gonna take a lot of work--

97
00:07:40,206 --> 00:07:44,085
A man was found murdered tonight
behind the railroad yards.

98
00:07:44,168 --> 00:07:47,505
Details are pending,
awaiting notification of next of kin.

99
00:07:49,256 --> 00:07:52,176
Thank you, Mr Smith.
Have a good weekend.

100
00:07:52,301 --> 00:07:54,512
That bastard!

101
00:07:54,595 --> 00:07:57,431
Why didn't he tell us
he was gonna spring a pop quiz?

102
00:07:57,515 --> 00:08:01,769
That's the point to a pop quiz--
to surprise you.

103
00:08:01,894 --> 00:08:03,687
Thanks, teach.

104
00:08:03,771 --> 00:08:05,231
Hey, Amy.

105
00:08:07,024 --> 00:08:09,944
Did she finally find out
whatyou're really like?

106
00:08:10,027 --> 00:08:11,487
Buzz off, Evil.

107
00:08:11,612 --> 00:08:13,989
Oh. Call me
anything you want.

108
00:08:14,115 --> 00:08:16,617
You're the one failing trig,
not me.

109
00:08:44,145 --> 00:08:46,105
Is this 99 Oak?

110
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:48,482
No, that's next door.

111
00:08:48,607 --> 00:08:50,568
Thanks.

112
00:09:00,995 --> 00:09:03,831
- Hey, Mom?
- Yeah. I'm in here.

113
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,085
Have you seen
the new guy next door?

114
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:10,713
No, but he's got
a live-in carpenter.

115
00:09:10,838 --> 00:09:12,923
With my luck,
he's probably gay.

116
00:09:13,007 --> 00:09:14,467
I don't think so.

117
00:09:14,592 --> 00:09:17,511
- Why? What do you know that I don't?
- Oh, nothing.

118
00:09:17,595 --> 00:09:19,346
I gotta go study.

119
00:09:19,472 --> 00:09:21,766
Study? You?

120
00:09:59,929 --> 00:10:01,389
Hi.

121
00:10:05,142 --> 00:10:07,144
I'm really sorry
about the other night.

122
00:10:07,228 --> 00:10:09,814
It was my fault, not yours.

123
00:10:09,939 --> 00:10:11,190
It was?

124
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:15,069
Look, Amy, I loveyou.

125
00:10:16,821 --> 00:10:19,240
I never wanna fight
with you again.

126
00:10:19,323 --> 00:10:21,742
I'm so glad we're getting this
straightened out.

127
00:10:21,826 --> 00:10:25,037
- Police have reported a second murder.
- I've been miserable the past two days.

128
00:10:25,162 --> 00:10:27,331
The second victim,
whose body was found this morning...

129
00:10:27,456 --> 00:10:29,417
was a known prostitute.

130
00:10:29,542 --> 00:10:31,919
Not talkin' to you
on the phone--

131
00:10:32,044 --> 00:10:33,921
Charley, are you
listening to me?

132
00:10:34,004 --> 00:10:38,300
The mutilated corpse was found under
the North Creek bridge by the old mill.

133
00:10:38,426 --> 00:10:39,844
There are no leads--

134
00:10:39,969 --> 00:10:43,514
- Know what I heard on the police band?
- What?

135
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:46,350
That wasn't the only murder.

136
00:10:46,434 --> 00:10:48,436
The second in two days.

137
00:10:49,562 --> 00:10:51,981
And get this--

138
00:10:52,064 --> 00:10:55,526
both of 'em
had their heads chopped off.

139
00:10:55,609 --> 00:10:57,194
Can you believe it?

140
00:10:57,278 --> 00:10:59,155
You're sick

141
00:11:13,544 --> 00:11:16,380
You're so cool, Brewster!

142
00:11:17,506 --> 00:11:19,091
I can't stand it!

143
00:11:55,252 --> 00:11:56,170
Hey, kid!

144
00:11:59,006 --> 00:12:02,009
- What are you doing?
- Nothin'.

145
00:12:02,134 --> 00:12:03,677
Oh, yeah?

146
00:12:03,803 --> 00:12:06,847
Well, just make sure
that it stays that way...

147
00:12:06,931 --> 00:12:08,265
kid.

148
00:14:37,832 --> 00:14:40,751
Mom, get up! I can't believe
what's happening next door!

149
00:14:40,835 --> 00:14:42,712
- What?
- He has fangs.

150
00:14:42,837 --> 00:14:45,089
The guy who bought the house
has fangs.

151
00:14:45,214 --> 00:14:48,843
Fangs. That's lovely.
I have to get up at 7:00 tomorrow.

152
00:14:54,181 --> 00:14:56,183
Fangs? Charley!

153
00:15:44,315 --> 00:15:45,900
You forgot something.

154
00:16:31,779 --> 00:16:34,615
This microwave never melts
the marshmallows right.

155
00:16:34,699 --> 00:16:36,701
Drink that.

156
00:16:36,784 --> 00:16:40,037
I don't need hot cocoa.
I didn't have a nightmare.

157
00:16:40,121 --> 00:16:42,540
They did kill a girl
over there.

158
00:16:42,623 --> 00:16:45,543
- How late did you stay up studying?
- Mom, I'm not sick!

159
00:16:45,626 --> 00:16:47,545
The guy did have fangs.

160
00:16:47,628 --> 00:16:51,173
A bat did fly over my head and a second
later he stepped out of the shadows.

161
00:16:51,298 --> 00:16:53,134
Don't you see what that means?

162
00:16:53,259 --> 00:16:54,635
Wait, let me guess.

163
00:16:54,719 --> 00:16:55,761
What?

164
00:16:56,804 --> 00:16:58,681
He's a vampire!

165
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:00,558
A what?

166
00:17:01,892 --> 00:17:05,646
A vampire! Haven't you listened
to anything I've said?

167
00:17:08,065 --> 00:17:11,193
Charley, is this
some sort of a trick..

168
00:17:11,318 --> 00:17:13,154
to get me back?

169
00:17:14,655 --> 00:17:17,324
Forget it.
I'm going to the police.

170
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:20,369
You can't tell the police that.
They'll lock you up.

171
00:17:20,494 --> 00:17:23,414
All right, I won't tell them
he's a vampire.

172
00:17:23,497 --> 00:17:26,500
But I sure am gonna tell them
about the two women.

173
00:17:40,264 --> 00:17:42,349
You're sure about this now?

174
00:17:49,857 --> 00:17:52,068
- Yes?
- Mr Dandrige?

175
00:17:52,193 --> 00:17:54,779
No, I'm his roommate,
Billy Cole.

176
00:17:54,862 --> 00:17:58,449
Lieutenant Lennox, Homicide.
Do you mind if we come in?

177
00:17:58,532 --> 00:18:00,701
No, not at all.
Come on in.

178
00:18:08,626 --> 00:18:10,836
This is quite a place
you have here.

179
00:18:10,961 --> 00:18:14,048
- Yeah. We're restoring it.
- Where is Mr Dandrige?

180
00:18:14,173 --> 00:18:15,841
He's away on business.

181
00:18:15,925 --> 00:18:19,053
- Can I help you?
- There was a murder last night.

182
00:18:19,178 --> 00:18:22,515
Your neighbour Charley thinks
he saw the victim in this house.

183
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,309
That's impossible.
I was here with jerry last night.

184
00:18:25,434 --> 00:18:28,145
-Therewas nobody else here.
- That's a lie.

185
00:18:28,229 --> 00:18:31,190
I saw him carry her body out
in a plastic bag.

186
00:18:31,273 --> 00:18:33,651
What do you say to that?

187
00:18:33,776 --> 00:18:37,238
Kid's crazy. I took some bags out,
but they were full oftrash.

188
00:18:37,321 --> 00:18:38,364
Amy?

189
00:18:38,489 --> 00:18:40,157
Here, let me show you.

190
00:18:40,241 --> 00:18:44,495
Look, the bag I saw
had a body in it, not trash.

191
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,997
You actually see the body,
Charley?

192
00:18:48,999 --> 00:18:51,377
- Well, no, but--
- Okay.

193
00:18:51,502 --> 00:18:55,339
Let me take you out back I'll show you
the bags I put in the garbage.

194
00:18:55,464 --> 00:18:58,592
- Okay, let's see them.
- I can prove he's lying!

195
00:19:00,886 --> 00:19:02,680
Let's look in the basement
instead.

196
00:19:02,763 --> 00:19:04,557
What's down there, Charley?

197
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,268
Yes, Charley.
What's down there?

198
00:19:10,896 --> 00:19:13,274
Obviously the boy's
made a mistake, Officer.

199
00:19:13,399 --> 00:19:17,069
A coffin! That's what's down there.
I saw them carry it in.

200
00:19:18,112 --> 00:19:19,238
What?

201
00:19:19,363 --> 00:19:22,158
Jerry Dandrige is in it,
sleeping the sleep ofthe undead.

202
00:19:25,494 --> 00:19:27,371
What are you talking about?

203
00:19:27,496 --> 00:19:29,582
- He's a vampire.
- Uh-oh!

204
00:19:29,665 --> 00:19:32,877
I saw him last night. He had fangs,
and he bit her on the neck

205
00:19:33,002 --> 00:19:34,795
For heaven's sake!

206
00:19:34,879 --> 00:19:36,630
- Come on.
- What?

207
00:19:36,756 --> 00:19:39,341
Wait!
We can't just leave like this!

208
00:19:39,467 --> 00:19:41,761
I got a coffin for you!

209
00:19:41,886 --> 00:19:43,846
I don't care what you say!

210
00:19:46,348 --> 00:19:48,225
Lieutenant,
please listen to me!

211
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:51,979
Look, I'm telling you,
Jerry Dandrige is a vampire.

212
00:19:52,063 --> 00:19:54,398
Sure, and I'm Dirty Harry.
Listen.

213
00:19:54,482 --> 00:19:58,569
If I ever catch your ass at the station
again, I'm throwing it in jail forever!

214
00:19:58,652 --> 00:20:01,572
Lieutenant,
just listen to me for a second!

215
00:20:01,655 --> 00:20:04,492
I know it's crazy!
I know that, but--

216
00:20:04,575 --> 00:20:06,243
Look, Lieutenant--

217
00:20:27,223 --> 00:20:28,766
Oh, my God.

218
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:57,169
Evil!

219
00:21:00,047 --> 00:21:03,217
And to what do I owe
this dubious pleasure?

220
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,302
The vampire knows
I know about him.

221
00:21:05,386 --> 00:21:08,097
Or at least he will
when he wakes up tonight.

222
00:21:08,222 --> 00:21:09,682
What are you talking about?

223
00:21:09,765 --> 00:21:11,851
A vampire is living
next door to me...

224
00:21:11,976 --> 00:21:14,770
and he's gonna kill me
if I don't protect myself.

225
00:21:16,647 --> 00:21:19,150
- What?
- I haven't got time to explain.

226
00:21:19,233 --> 00:21:22,486
Just tell me what to do
to protect myself.

227
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:24,655
Very funny, Brewster.

228
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:27,074
Evil, please!
I'm not kidding!

229
00:21:27,158 --> 00:21:30,411
- Tell me what to do!
- Don't call me Evil any more!

230
00:21:31,662 --> 00:21:34,165
Why should I help you anyway?

231
00:21:34,248 --> 00:21:36,333
Look, I've got eight bucks.

232
00:21:36,459 --> 00:21:38,669
Help me and it's yours.

233
00:21:40,629 --> 00:21:43,966
Far be it from me
to turn down a fool's money.

234
00:21:50,014 --> 00:21:54,185
Where and when doyou expect
the vampire to attack?

235
00:21:54,268 --> 00:21:56,187
In my bedroom, tonight.

236
00:22:01,067 --> 00:22:03,694
Start with this.

237
00:22:03,778 --> 00:22:09,116
But you must have total faith in it
for it to work

238
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,202
Then get some garlic.

239
00:22:11,285 --> 00:22:14,705
Links of the stuff you can wear around
your neck and hang from your window.

240
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:18,709
If he comes for you,
that'll be the way. Then--

241
00:22:18,793 --> 00:22:22,004
Oh, of course!
There's holy water!

242
00:22:22,129 --> 00:22:26,384
But you gotta get a priest
to say a blessing over it first.

243
00:22:27,968 --> 00:22:30,262
- That's it?
- I'm afraid so.

244
00:22:30,346 --> 00:22:33,724
But your best protection
right now, Charles...

245
00:22:33,808 --> 00:22:37,269
is that a vampire
cannot enter your house...

246
00:22:37,353 --> 00:22:41,524
without being invited
by the rightful owner first.

247
00:22:41,649 --> 00:22:44,151
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

248
00:22:45,569 --> 00:22:47,154
Thank you. Thank you.

249
00:23:03,003 --> 00:23:07,258
Charley, could you come here, please?
There's someone I'd like you to meet.

250
00:23:08,634 --> 00:23:10,010
Yeah, Mom.

251
00:23:14,348 --> 00:23:16,684
Charley, this is
our next-door neighbour...

252
00:23:16,767 --> 00:23:18,519
Jerry Dandrige.

253
00:23:29,363 --> 00:23:30,740
Hello, Charley.

254
00:23:36,454 --> 00:23:38,956
Charley, don't be rude.
Shake hands.

255
00:23:48,966 --> 00:23:52,970
- What's he doing here?
- I invited him for a drink

256
00:23:53,054 --> 00:23:54,805
You what?

257
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:57,433
I invited him over.
Why?

258
00:23:57,558 --> 00:23:58,976
What's the matter, Charley?

259
00:23:59,101 --> 00:24:02,563
Afraid I'd never come over
without being invited first?

260
00:24:03,564 --> 00:24:05,232
You're quite right.

261
00:24:05,358 --> 00:24:07,735
Of course, now that
I've been made welcome...

262
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:10,780
I'll probably drop by
quite a bit.

263
00:24:10,905 --> 00:24:13,908
In fact,
anytime I feel like it.

264
00:24:16,202 --> 00:24:19,121
With your mother's
kind permission, of course.

265
00:24:19,246 --> 00:24:21,499
Oh, jerry, anytime.

266
00:24:23,292 --> 00:24:27,254
It's nice that someone interesting has
finally moved into the neighbourhood.

267
00:24:29,548 --> 00:24:31,509
Charley, are you all right?

268
00:24:33,511 --> 00:24:35,596
Yeah, Mom, I'm fine.

269
00:24:37,181 --> 00:24:39,433
I just gotta get back
to my trig.

270
00:24:39,558 --> 00:24:41,102
Nice to meet you.

271
00:24:42,478 --> 00:24:44,438
See you.

272
00:24:44,563 --> 00:24:46,232
Soon.

273
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:25,326
We wouldn't want towake
your mother, would we?

274
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:29,372
Then I'd have to kill her too.

275
00:28:29,497 --> 00:28:31,040
Right?

276
00:28:56,273 --> 00:28:59,944
Do you realize how much trouble
you've caused me?

277
00:29:00,027 --> 00:29:02,196
Spying on me.

278
00:29:02,321 --> 00:29:05,241
Almost disturbing my sleep
this afternoon.

279
00:29:06,784 --> 00:29:08,786
Telling policemen about me!

280
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:22,466
You deserve to die, boy.

281
00:29:26,721 --> 00:29:30,683
Of course, I could give you
something I don't have.

282
00:29:30,808 --> 00:29:32,226
A choice.

283
00:29:33,602 --> 00:29:35,813
Forget about me, Charley.

284
00:29:36,939 --> 00:29:39,233
Forget about me,
and I'll forget about you.

285
00:29:39,316 --> 00:29:41,235
What do you say, Charley?

286
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,416
Fool.

287
00:31:15,496 --> 00:31:16,914
Charley!

288
00:31:31,929 --> 00:31:34,348
Charley, can you hear me?

289
00:31:42,064 --> 00:31:43,524
Charley, is thatyou?

290
00:31:44,859 --> 00:31:46,444
My door is stuck

291
00:31:57,705 --> 00:32:01,250
- What is going on?
- Nothing. I just had a nightmare.

292
00:32:02,501 --> 00:32:05,713
I had one last night.
It was awful.

293
00:32:05,838 --> 00:32:10,009
I was at this white sale
and suddenly realized I was stark naked.

294
00:32:11,052 --> 00:32:13,054
- Now what is it?
- Nothing.

295
00:32:13,137 --> 00:32:15,014
Just raccoons
in the garbage again.

296
00:32:15,139 --> 00:32:17,641
- Go back to sleep.
- But what about your nightmare?

297
00:32:17,725 --> 00:32:20,311
- Do you want a Valium?
- I'm fine now.

298
00:32:20,436 --> 00:32:22,938
- Honest.
- I do need my sleep.

299
00:32:23,064 --> 00:32:26,817
I start the night shift tomorrow.
3:00 in the morning.

300
00:32:26,901 --> 00:32:29,820
- It's so bad for my complexion.
- Good night, Mom.

301
00:33:20,913 --> 00:33:23,124
I know you're there, Charley.

302
00:33:23,207 --> 00:33:24,875
I can see you.

303
00:33:34,552 --> 00:33:36,345
What's the matter, Charley?

304
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:38,305
scared?

305
00:33:39,473 --> 00:33:43,227
You started this, Charley,
and I'm gonna finish it.

306
00:33:46,564 --> 00:33:48,733
I just destroyed your car,
Charley.

307
00:33:50,401 --> 00:33:53,863
But that's nothing compared
to what I'm gonna do to you...

308
00:33:56,365 --> 00:33:57,742
tomorrow night.

309
00:34:04,582 --> 00:34:06,792
Once again, your host...

310
00:34:06,917 --> 00:34:08,669
Peter Vincent.

311
00:34:08,753 --> 00:34:11,172
Good evening, horror fans.

312
00:34:11,255 --> 00:34:14,300
Did you know
there are a lot of people...

313
00:34:14,425 --> 00:34:16,927
who do not believe in vampires?

314
00:34:17,845 --> 00:34:19,305
But I do...

315
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:23,184
because I know they exist.

316
00:34:23,267 --> 00:34:28,189
I have fought them
in all their guises--

317
00:34:28,272 --> 00:34:32,109
man, wolves, bats--

318
00:34:32,234 --> 00:34:36,697
and I have always won!

319
00:34:37,656 --> 00:34:40,159
That is why they call me...

320
00:34:40,284 --> 00:34:42,787
the great vampire killer.

321
00:34:44,622 --> 00:34:46,123
Now...

322
00:34:47,375 --> 00:34:49,460
watch me do it.

323
00:34:59,136 --> 00:35:00,471
Go, Peter.

324
00:35:05,601 --> 00:35:07,395
Go.

325
00:35:18,739 --> 00:35:22,827
Mr Vincent,
could I talk to you for a minute?

326
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:25,621
Please, Mr Vincent.
It's very, very important.

327
00:35:25,746 --> 00:35:29,083
- What do you want me to sign?
- Pardon me?

328
00:35:29,166 --> 00:35:31,168
You do want my autograph,
don't you?

329
00:35:32,294 --> 00:35:35,631
No, sir, I was curious about
what you said last night on TV...

330
00:35:35,715 --> 00:35:37,591
about believing in vampires.

331
00:35:37,717 --> 00:35:39,593
What about it?

332
00:35:39,677 --> 00:35:41,262
Were you serious?

333
00:35:42,096 --> 00:35:43,556
Oh, absolutely.

334
00:35:45,433 --> 00:35:48,227
Unfortunately,
none of your generation seems to be.

335
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:49,812
What do you mean?

336
00:35:49,937 --> 00:35:53,691
I have just been fired because nobody
wants to see vampire killers any more...

337
00:35:53,774 --> 00:35:55,359
or vampires either.

338
00:35:55,443 --> 00:35:58,279
Apparently all they want
are demented madmen...

339
00:35:58,362 --> 00:36:02,033
running around in ski masks
hacking up young virgins.

340
00:36:02,116 --> 00:36:03,451
Excuse me.

341
00:36:05,244 --> 00:36:07,121
I believe in vampires.

342
00:36:13,252 --> 00:36:14,545
That's nice.

343
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:19,633
If only there had been more of you,
perhaps my ratings would've been higher.

344
00:36:19,759 --> 00:36:23,471
In fact, I have one
living next door to me.

345
00:36:23,596 --> 00:36:25,473
Would you help me kill him?

346
00:36:28,309 --> 00:36:29,643
Pardon me?

347
00:36:29,727 --> 00:36:32,271
You know that murder
a few days ago?

348
00:36:32,355 --> 00:36:33,898
Yes.

349
00:36:34,023 --> 00:36:38,194
The guy who lives next door to me
did it, and he's a vampire.

350
00:36:39,987 --> 00:36:43,824
If this is your idea of a joke,
I am not amused.

351
00:36:43,908 --> 00:36:45,993
Mr Vincent, I am not joking.

352
00:36:46,118 --> 00:36:48,329
I am deadly serious.

353
00:36:49,455 --> 00:36:52,375
Well, if you would excuse me--

354
00:36:53,501 --> 00:36:56,545
But, Mr Vincent,
you have to believe me.

355
00:36:56,670 --> 00:37:00,508
I'm telling the truth.
You just said you believed in vampires.

356
00:37:00,591 --> 00:37:02,676
I lied.

357
00:37:02,802 --> 00:37:04,762
Now, if you will leave me alone--

358
00:37:04,887 --> 00:37:06,764
You have to listen to me!

359
00:37:06,847 --> 00:37:09,350
The vampire tried
to kill me last night...

360
00:37:09,475 --> 00:37:11,644
and trashed my car
when he didn't succeed.

361
00:37:11,769 --> 00:37:16,774
He's gonna be back tonight.
If I don't get help, he's gonna kill me.

362
00:37:16,857 --> 00:37:18,776
Mr Vincent!

363
00:37:18,859 --> 00:37:21,362
Just listen to me for a second.

364
00:37:21,445 --> 00:37:22,947
No! Wait!

365
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:25,199
Please, Mr Vincent!
Wait!

366
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:35,126
- What are you doing here?
- What about you? You just dumped him.

367
00:37:35,209 --> 00:37:38,754
- It's none of your business.
- So you do like him.

368
00:37:38,879 --> 00:37:40,339
Anybody home?

369
00:37:48,973 --> 00:37:50,641
Wow.

370
00:37:56,814 --> 00:37:58,816
What's all this for?

371
00:37:58,899 --> 00:38:00,985
Self-defence.

372
00:38:01,068 --> 00:38:03,279
Not that I think I'll need it.

373
00:38:03,404 --> 00:38:05,239
He'll be dead before nightfall.

374
00:38:05,364 --> 00:38:07,950
- Who will be?
- Dandrige.

375
00:38:08,075 --> 00:38:11,912
I'm waiting for the guy he liveswith to
leave, then I'm gonna find his coffin...

376
00:38:12,038 --> 00:38:13,998
and pound this
through his heart.

377
00:38:15,583 --> 00:38:17,168
That's murder, Charley.

378
00:38:19,545 --> 00:38:22,173
You can't murder a vampire, Amy.

379
00:38:22,256 --> 00:38:24,884
They're dead. Remember?

380
00:38:27,053 --> 00:38:29,972
Listen.
I just taped this.

381
00:38:33,517 --> 00:38:35,519
Amy.

382
00:38:35,603 --> 00:38:37,480
What are we gonna do?

383
00:38:37,605 --> 00:38:39,690
This is just like Fright Night.

384
00:38:39,774 --> 00:38:43,861
Nowforthe news. Anotheryoung woman's
body was discovered this morning...

385
00:38:43,944 --> 00:38:45,821
in back of the sheridan Mall--

386
00:38:45,946 --> 00:38:47,573
I don't have any choice.

387
00:38:48,616 --> 00:38:50,701
Somebody has to stop him.

388
00:38:52,495 --> 00:38:55,414
It's gonna be dangerous
going into that house all alone.

389
00:38:58,334 --> 00:39:00,836
You'll need all the help
you can get.

390
00:39:01,545 --> 00:39:03,964
Somebody like Peter Vincent,
for instance?

391
00:39:04,048 --> 00:39:05,549
I tried him already.

392
00:39:06,675 --> 00:39:09,470
Well, let us try again
before you do anything.

393
00:39:09,595 --> 00:39:12,098
There's not enough time, Amy.

394
00:39:12,223 --> 00:39:15,142
Well, what happens
if you go into that house alone...

395
00:39:15,226 --> 00:39:17,019
and he gets you?

396
00:39:17,103 --> 00:39:18,979
Who's gonna stop him then?

397
00:39:19,105 --> 00:39:23,359
Yeah. Then he'll be able to suck his way
through the entire town.

398
00:39:24,735 --> 00:39:27,196
Not that it would be
much of a loss.

399
00:39:27,321 --> 00:39:29,740
Charley, it's gonna be dark soon.

400
00:39:31,367 --> 00:39:34,328
You don't want to go
into that house then, doyou?

401
00:39:34,412 --> 00:39:36,831
No, you're right there.

402
00:39:41,293 --> 00:39:44,004
- All right, try him again.
- Great.

403
00:39:44,004 --> 00:39:47,425
You promise you're not gonna
do anything till you hear from us?

404
00:39:50,052 --> 00:39:51,429
Okay. Come on.

405
00:39:54,306 --> 00:39:56,517
You don't believe me,
doyou?

406
00:39:58,269 --> 00:40:00,062
I love you, Charley.

407
00:40:00,187 --> 00:40:01,605
Hey, Amy, come on!

408
00:40:20,207 --> 00:40:21,333
Yes?

409
00:40:21,417 --> 00:40:24,462
Mr. Vincent,
could we talk to you for a moment?

410
00:40:24,545 --> 00:40:27,465
I'm afraid now
is not the best time.

411
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:30,384
Please.
It's very important.

412
00:40:33,846 --> 00:40:35,514
Well, if you would just...

413
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:38,559
wait there for one moment--

414
00:40:39,977 --> 00:40:41,228
Come in!

415
00:40:44,148 --> 00:40:46,567
What can I do for you?

416
00:40:48,027 --> 00:40:49,487
An autograph, perhaps?

417
00:40:51,155 --> 00:40:54,158
Perhaps an interview
for your school newspaper?

418
00:40:54,283 --> 00:40:56,494
I'm afraid this is
much more important.

419
00:40:58,162 --> 00:40:59,580
Really?

420
00:41:01,791 --> 00:41:04,835
What could be more important
than my autograph?

421
00:41:04,919 --> 00:41:06,587
Saving a boy's life.

422
00:41:07,421 --> 00:41:09,006
Oh. Yes.

423
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:12,927
I can see where that
could be more important.

424
00:41:13,052 --> 00:41:17,348
Perhaps you would care to explain.

425
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:21,519
Remember a fruitcake kid
named Charley Brewster?

426
00:41:21,602 --> 00:41:22,937
He said he saw you.

427
00:41:24,438 --> 00:41:27,108
The one who believes
a vampire lives next to him.

428
00:41:27,233 --> 00:41:30,027
Oh, yes.
You know, he is insane.

429
00:41:31,529 --> 00:41:33,364
Oh, my dear...

430
00:41:33,489 --> 00:41:35,991
I do hope he's not
a friend of yours.

431
00:41:36,117 --> 00:41:39,203
Yeah, she's got the hots
for the creep.

432
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:40,663
Amy!

433
00:41:40,788 --> 00:41:42,998
We need your help to stop him.

434
00:41:43,082 --> 00:41:45,876
He really believes
his next-door neighbour is a vampire...

435
00:41:46,001 --> 00:41:47,962
and he's planning to kill him.

436
00:41:48,087 --> 00:41:50,464
With a stake through the heart.

437
00:41:53,092 --> 00:41:55,052
Are you two serious?

438
00:41:56,303 --> 00:41:57,680
Oh, my dear.

439
00:41:57,805 --> 00:42:01,225
Your friend needs a psychiatrist,
not a vampire killer.

440
00:42:01,308 --> 00:42:03,936
- Please, Mr Vincent.
- I'm afraid not.

441
00:42:04,061 --> 00:42:07,148
You see, Hollywood beckons.

442
00:42:07,273 --> 00:42:11,736
I have just been offered
a starring role in a major film.

443
00:42:11,861 --> 00:42:14,905
I have even had to quit
Fright Night.

444
00:42:14,989 --> 00:42:17,074
- I'll give you money.
- How much?

445
00:42:17,158 --> 00:42:19,160
I have a $500 savings bond.

446
00:42:19,243 --> 00:42:20,536
I'll take it.

447
00:42:22,288 --> 00:42:27,918
Now, how are we going to cure
your little friend...

448
00:42:28,002 --> 00:42:29,920
ofthis delusion?

449
00:42:30,629 --> 00:42:32,590
I got it all figured out.

450
00:42:32,715 --> 00:42:35,134
We all go next door
to the neighbour...

451
00:42:35,217 --> 00:42:38,345
and you perform some kind of
vampire test on him...

452
00:42:38,429 --> 00:42:40,514
to pronounce him human.

453
00:42:40,639 --> 00:42:44,185
You know.
Like in Orgy of the Damned?

454
00:42:44,268 --> 00:42:47,188
Where you looked in the mirror...

455
00:42:47,313 --> 00:42:52,193
the guy didn't have a reflection,
so then you knew he was a vampire.

456
00:42:53,361 --> 00:42:54,820
Oh, yes.

457
00:42:57,323 --> 00:42:59,825
That was one
of my favourite roles.

458
00:43:03,454 --> 00:43:06,082
Do you know...

459
00:43:06,165 --> 00:43:08,042
I still...

460
00:43:09,210 --> 00:43:11,087
have the prop.

461
00:43:43,202 --> 00:43:44,328
It's for you.

462
00:43:51,669 --> 00:43:53,504
Yes, this is jerry Dandrige.

463
00:43:56,841 --> 00:43:59,260
I see.

464
00:43:59,343 --> 00:44:00,720
Well, yes, of course.

465
00:44:00,845 --> 00:44:03,931
I'm always willing
to help young people...

466
00:44:04,056 --> 00:44:07,184
but I'm afraid that crosses
are out ofthe question.

467
00:44:07,268 --> 00:44:11,355
You see,
I've been reborn recently.

468
00:44:11,439 --> 00:44:13,357
He's a reborn Christian.

469
00:44:13,441 --> 00:44:15,860
He thinks crosses
would be sacrilegious.

470
00:44:15,943 --> 00:44:20,031
- Ask him how he feels about holy water.
- How about holy water?

471
00:44:20,114 --> 00:44:21,490
No. Won't do either.

472
00:44:21,574 --> 00:44:25,202
Tell him it's ordinary tap water.
All he has to do is sip it.

473
00:44:28,956 --> 00:44:31,667
Oh, yes. Yes. Okay.
That sounds fine.

474
00:44:31,792 --> 00:44:36,172
But don't bring him over
until 6:00 tomorrow.

475
00:44:36,297 --> 00:44:38,382
I'll be out until then.

476
00:44:42,094 --> 00:44:45,222
Seems we don't have to go out
tonight after all.

477
00:44:45,347 --> 00:44:49,643
His friends are bringing him over
tomorrow night...

478
00:44:49,727 --> 00:44:51,896
to prove to him that I'm not...

479
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:54,398
a vampire.

480
00:44:59,028 --> 00:45:01,906
It's 6:10. He said
he was gonna be here at 6:00.

481
00:45:02,031 --> 00:45:04,408
He said he'd be here.
He'll be here.

482
00:45:05,493 --> 00:45:06,911
Here he comes!

483
00:45:13,626 --> 00:45:16,504
Thank you.
Charley Brewster, I presume.

484
00:45:16,629 --> 00:45:18,589
Peter Vincent, vampire killer.

485
00:45:18,714 --> 00:45:21,842
I cannot tell you
how much I appreciate this.

486
00:45:21,967 --> 00:45:23,803
Good evening.
Now, down to business.

487
00:45:23,928 --> 00:45:28,307
Where is the lair of the suspected
creature ofthe night?

488
00:45:28,432 --> 00:45:29,433
There.

489
00:45:31,435 --> 00:45:33,312
Oh, yes.
I see what you mean.

490
00:45:34,438 --> 00:45:37,483
There is
a distinct possibility.

491
00:45:38,734 --> 00:45:40,695
Now, shall we go?

492
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:43,197
Wait.
Where's your stakes and hammers?

493
00:45:43,322 --> 00:45:45,282
I left them in my bag.

494
00:45:45,408 --> 00:45:47,284
You're not going in there
without them.

495
00:45:47,368 --> 00:45:51,664
But I have to prove that he is a vampire
before I kill him, Charley.

496
00:45:51,789 --> 00:45:54,458
Look, I know he's a vampire!

497
00:45:54,583 --> 00:45:57,503
I am the one
who has to know, Charley.

498
00:45:57,628 --> 00:45:59,463
How are you gonna do that?

499
00:46:00,423 --> 00:46:01,966
This is holy water.

500
00:46:02,091 --> 00:46:04,593
If a drop touches him,
he will blister.

501
00:46:04,719 --> 00:46:06,971
I have asked him to drink it...

502
00:46:07,096 --> 00:46:09,807
while we all watch.

503
00:46:09,890 --> 00:46:11,392
He readily agreed.

504
00:46:11,475 --> 00:46:14,895
But if I'm right and you prove
he is a vampire...

505
00:46:15,021 --> 00:46:16,397
he'll kill us all.

506
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,232
No, hewon't, Charley.

507
00:46:18,357 --> 00:46:21,485
After all, I am here to protect you,
and I am Peter Vincent!

508
00:46:21,569 --> 00:46:23,571
I know, Mr Vincent, but--

509
00:46:24,739 --> 00:46:26,157
Hey! Peter Vincent.

510
00:46:27,408 --> 00:46:29,076
Billy Cole.

511
00:46:29,201 --> 00:46:30,244
This is a pleasure.

512
00:46:31,495 --> 00:46:33,372
Won't you all come in?

513
00:46:38,586 --> 00:46:40,046
And Charley.

514
00:46:47,762 --> 00:46:50,765
Hey,jer! They're here.

515
00:46:52,683 --> 00:46:54,935
Perhaps he didn't hear you.

516
00:46:55,061 --> 00:46:57,438
He heard me, all right.

517
00:47:18,834 --> 00:47:19,960
Mr Vincent.

518
00:47:21,128 --> 00:47:22,713
I've seen all your films...

519
00:47:22,797 --> 00:47:25,633
and I've found them...

520
00:47:25,716 --> 00:47:26,967
very amusing.

521
00:47:27,051 --> 00:47:29,136
Oh. Thank you.

522
00:47:30,805 --> 00:47:32,807
And who are these two...

523
00:47:33,974 --> 00:47:36,644
attractive young people?

524
00:47:37,728 --> 00:47:39,563
Ed Thompson.

525
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:42,608
Amy Peterson.

526
00:48:03,254 --> 00:48:04,505
Charmed.

527
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:10,845
Isn't that what vampires
are supposed to do, Charley?

528
00:48:12,012 --> 00:48:14,598
- Please.
- That's some vampire, Brewster.

529
00:48:15,766 --> 00:48:17,518
God, he's neat.

530
00:48:27,862 --> 00:48:31,282
Please excuse the mess.
I haven't finished unpacking.

531
00:48:31,407 --> 00:48:34,118
Where do you keep your coffin?
Or do you have more than one?

532
00:48:34,201 --> 00:48:35,786
Charley!

533
00:48:35,870 --> 00:48:37,955
It's all right, Mr Vincent.

534
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:41,000
I'm quite used to it by now.

535
00:48:41,125 --> 00:48:44,962
As you may or may not know, Charley even
brought the police over a few days ago.

536
00:48:45,046 --> 00:48:46,547
Charley, you didn't!

537
00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:50,718
Damn right I did. Only they didn't
believe me any more than any of you.

538
00:48:52,053 --> 00:48:53,304
But you'll believe me soon.

539
00:48:53,387 --> 00:48:55,306
Give him the holy water.

540
00:48:57,266 --> 00:48:59,977
Charley, there's no reason
to be rude about this.

541
00:49:00,061 --> 00:49:02,688
It's perfectly all right,
MrVincent.

542
00:49:04,899 --> 00:49:06,734
Where is it?

543
00:49:12,907 --> 00:49:16,577
And are you sure
that this is holy water?

544
00:49:17,578 --> 00:49:18,746
Positive.

545
00:49:19,789 --> 00:49:22,708
I saw Father Scanlon
bless it myself.

546
00:49:24,585 --> 00:49:27,004
Get ready to run.
I'll protect you.

547
00:49:38,349 --> 00:49:39,684
Bottoms up.

548
00:49:55,116 --> 00:49:56,367
There.

549
00:49:56,492 --> 00:49:58,035
Satisfied?

550
00:49:58,869 --> 00:50:00,788
Totally.

551
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:05,543
Well, now, Charley,
you saw that.

552
00:50:05,668 --> 00:50:10,381
Are you convinced now
that Mr Dandrige is not a vampire?

553
00:50:10,464 --> 00:50:12,216
It can't be.

554
00:50:12,341 --> 00:50:14,635
But, Charley, you saw it.

555
00:50:14,719 --> 00:50:18,889
You know as well as I do that
no vampire can drink blessed water.

556
00:50:20,474 --> 00:50:22,059
Then it wasn't blessed.

557
00:50:22,143 --> 00:50:24,311
Arey ou calling me a liar,
young man?

558
00:50:25,563 --> 00:50:27,898
Ifhe's not a vampire...

559
00:50:27,982 --> 00:50:29,316
have him touch this.

560
00:50:33,612 --> 00:50:35,990
You've made
a fool of yourself once.

561
00:50:36,115 --> 00:50:38,909
There's no reason
to compound the error.

562
00:50:39,035 --> 00:50:42,163
You've already caused your friends
quite enough pain.

563
00:50:47,918 --> 00:50:51,839
You wouldn't want to cause them
any more, would you?

564
00:51:07,605 --> 00:51:09,482
No, of course not.

565
00:51:09,607 --> 00:51:13,361
Then you're finally convinced
I'm not a vampire either?

566
00:51:13,444 --> 00:51:14,779
Right?

567
00:51:16,030 --> 00:51:17,281
Yes.

568
00:51:17,406 --> 00:51:20,868
Well, I'm glad that's settled.

569
00:51:22,119 --> 00:51:25,623
I can't tell you how much
I appreciate this, Mr Vincent.

570
00:51:25,748 --> 00:51:28,542
-You've been a great help.
- Glad to be of service.

571
00:51:28,667 --> 00:51:32,838
It was very nice meeting both of you.
Feel free to drop by anytime.

572
00:51:32,963 --> 00:51:35,216
You'll always be welcome.

573
00:51:35,341 --> 00:51:37,635
I'd like that, Mr Dandrige.

574
00:51:37,718 --> 00:51:39,303
Please call me jerry.

575
00:51:39,387 --> 00:51:41,389
Let's get out of here.

576
00:51:41,472 --> 00:51:43,683
That goes for you too, Ed.

577
00:51:43,808 --> 00:51:47,228
I expect we have a lot of the same
interests-- horror movies, the occult.

578
00:51:50,773 --> 00:51:52,858
Something wrong, Mr Vincent?

579
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:56,737
I just felt a little--

580
00:52:00,991 --> 00:52:03,703
It was just my clumsiness.

581
00:52:06,205 --> 00:52:07,581
Are you sure?

582
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:10,167
I'm positive.

583
00:52:10,251 --> 00:52:13,170
We have been taking up
much too much of your time.

584
00:52:13,295 --> 00:52:16,215
Thank you so much.
Come along now, everybody.

585
00:52:17,758 --> 00:52:19,677
Thankyou. Bye-bye.

586
00:52:23,305 --> 00:52:25,683
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing.

587
00:52:25,808 --> 00:52:28,602
- Then why are you shaking?
- I'm not shaking.

588
00:52:28,728 --> 00:52:32,606
You saw something that convinced you
he was a vampire, didn'tyou?

589
00:52:32,690 --> 00:52:35,609
- Of course not!
- Please, Mr Vincent.

590
00:52:35,693 --> 00:52:37,778
You have to tell me.

591
00:52:37,903 --> 00:52:39,280
All right!

592
00:52:41,449 --> 00:52:43,951
He didn't cast a reflection
in my mirror.

593
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:48,205
- Satisfied now?
- You have to call the police!

594
00:52:48,330 --> 00:52:49,707
Shit!

595
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:54,170
Where are you goin',
pencil dick?

596
00:52:54,295 --> 00:52:55,546
- Home!
- No way.

597
00:52:55,629 --> 00:52:57,798
We walkAmy home first.

598
00:53:00,551 --> 00:53:03,137
Looks just like her,
doesn't she?

599
00:53:09,477 --> 00:53:10,561
One good thing--

600
00:53:11,668 --> 00:53:13,545
they'll never believe him now.

601
00:53:20,219 --> 00:53:21,762
No?

602
00:53:28,018 --> 00:53:29,937
- Let's cut through here.
- No way!

603
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:33,273
We want people and lights.
The more, the better.

604
00:53:33,357 --> 00:53:36,610
Listen, Brewster,
vampires don't exist.

605
00:53:36,693 --> 00:53:38,695
Haven't you figured that outyet?

606
00:53:38,779 --> 00:53:40,781
What if you're wrong, Evil?

607
00:53:40,864 --> 00:53:43,784
What if Dandrige is a vampire
and he thinks you know it?

608
00:53:43,867 --> 00:53:47,037
Would you walk down
that alley then?

609
00:53:48,789 --> 00:53:51,291
Oh, fuck you, Brewster.

610
00:53:51,375 --> 00:53:53,877
Evil, just stick with us,
all right?

611
00:53:54,002 --> 00:53:56,922
Forget it!
You may be chicken shit, but I'm not.

612
00:53:59,424 --> 00:54:01,301
- What'll we do?
- Let him go.

613
00:54:01,385 --> 00:54:04,847
No vampire's gonna want him anyway.
Probably give him blood poisoning.

614
00:54:11,228 --> 00:54:13,188
Jesus! I warned him!

615
00:54:13,313 --> 00:54:16,233
He got me, Charley!
He bit me!

616
00:54:17,568 --> 00:54:21,113
You know what you're gonna
have to do now, don'tyou?

617
00:54:21,238 --> 00:54:22,781
Kill me.

618
00:54:22,906 --> 00:54:24,575
Kill me, Charley...

619
00:54:24,658 --> 00:54:27,661
before I turn into a vampire...

620
00:54:27,786 --> 00:54:29,746
and giveyou a hickey!

621
00:54:31,748 --> 00:54:33,417
You asshole!

622
00:54:35,294 --> 00:54:38,338
You really believed me,
you poor dope!

623
00:54:38,422 --> 00:54:39,882
You'll get yours someday.

624
00:54:40,007 --> 00:54:43,218
Oh, yeah? When?
When I'm bit by a vampire?

625
00:54:43,343 --> 00:54:46,972
There are no such things
as vampires, fruitcake!

626
00:55:35,145 --> 00:55:37,147
Charley, Amy, is thatyou?

627
00:55:43,403 --> 00:55:45,656
It's not working.
I'm not scared.

628
00:57:05,986 --> 00:57:07,321
Hello, Edward.

629
00:57:09,907 --> 00:57:12,409
You don't have to be
afraid of me.

630
00:57:13,785 --> 00:57:15,662
I know what it's like
being different.

631
00:57:17,331 --> 00:57:19,625
Only they won't
pick on you any more...

632
00:57:20,667 --> 00:57:21,835
or beat you up.

633
00:57:23,795 --> 00:57:25,172
I'll see to that.

634
00:57:27,341 --> 00:57:29,927
All you have to do
is take my hand.

635
00:57:31,011 --> 00:57:32,137
Here, Edward.

636
00:57:32,262 --> 00:57:34,097
Take my hand.

637
00:57:57,996 --> 00:57:59,873
What was that?

638
00:58:03,126 --> 00:58:05,712
Just Evil
messing around again.

639
00:58:05,838 --> 00:58:10,008
Cut it out, Evil!
It's not funny!

640
00:58:10,092 --> 00:58:13,428
Amy, what if Evil
was really in trouble?

641
00:58:13,554 --> 00:58:16,974
You're not gonna let him
sucker you in again, are you?

642
00:58:27,609 --> 00:58:31,071
Don't tell me
this is a power outage.

643
00:58:31,154 --> 00:58:33,240
Well, what else would it be?

644
00:59:24,208 --> 00:59:26,293
Hey! You can't come in here!

645
00:59:39,056 --> 00:59:41,433
- Who are you calling?
- The police.

646
00:59:43,310 --> 00:59:44,478
Who is it?

647
00:59:44,561 --> 00:59:45,812
Me. Evil Ed.

648
00:59:45,896 --> 00:59:48,398
- What do you want?
- There's a vampire out here.

649
00:59:48,524 --> 00:59:50,067
Let me in.

650
00:59:56,156 --> 00:59:57,699
What are we going to do?

651
00:59:58,659 --> 01:00:01,453
What are you gonna do?

652
01:00:08,418 --> 01:00:10,087
Not me!

653
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:23,016
I used to admire you.
You know that?

654
01:00:23,141 --> 01:00:25,102
But, of course...

655
01:00:25,227 --> 01:00:27,187
that was before...

656
01:00:27,312 --> 01:00:30,524
I found out
what a fake you were!

657
01:00:30,649 --> 01:00:32,860
Peter Vincent...

658
01:00:32,943 --> 01:00:34,820
the great vampire killer!

659
01:01:04,141 --> 01:01:06,643
What haveyou done to me?

660
01:01:06,727 --> 01:01:07,978
Back!

661
01:01:13,734 --> 01:01:16,737
The masterwill kill you
for this.

662
01:01:16,820 --> 01:01:19,156
But not fast.

663
01:01:19,239 --> 01:01:22,910
Slowly. Oh, so slowly.

664
01:01:22,993 --> 01:01:24,161
Back

665
01:01:25,579 --> 01:01:27,498
I say back!

666
01:01:34,254 --> 01:01:36,256
He doesn't believe me!

667
01:01:36,340 --> 01:01:40,844
I'm scared, Charley.
I'm really scared.

668
01:01:40,928 --> 01:01:43,764
I am not going to let him
get you, Amy.

669
01:01:44,890 --> 01:01:46,767
I promise.

670
01:01:48,435 --> 01:01:50,729
You got Peter Vincent's number?

671
01:01:50,854 --> 01:01:56,026
He doesn't care about us!
I paid him to be there today.

672
01:01:56,151 --> 01:01:58,862
It doesn't matter, Amy.

673
01:01:58,946 --> 01:02:02,824
We don't have any choice.
Now give me his number.

674
01:03:27,284 --> 01:03:29,286
Look, you've gotta help us.

675
01:03:29,369 --> 01:03:31,955
Dandrige has me and Amy
trapped in this club downtown.

676
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:33,749
No, Charley. I'm sorry.

677
01:03:33,874 --> 01:03:35,834
I just can't do that.

678
01:03:35,959 --> 01:03:39,713
You've gotta come. You're the only one
who knows what's going on.

679
01:06:22,876 --> 01:06:24,878
Let her go.

680
01:06:33,095 --> 01:06:35,472
Filthy son of a bitch!

681
01:06:40,602 --> 01:06:42,563
Shouldn't lose
your temper, Charley.

682
01:06:44,565 --> 01:06:46,149
It isn't polite.

683
01:06:46,233 --> 01:06:48,652
You can't kill me here.

684
01:06:49,778 --> 01:06:53,240
I don't wanna kill you, Charley.

685
01:06:53,323 --> 01:06:56,243
I want you to bring Peter Vincent
to my house-- just the two of you.

686
01:06:56,326 --> 01:07:00,747
That is, ifyou everwant
to see Amy again.

687
01:07:09,673 --> 01:07:11,758
- Let her go!
- I got him.

688
01:07:11,884 --> 01:07:14,678
- She's mine.
- You want chicken, go someplace else.

689
01:07:14,803 --> 01:07:16,763
- Out of my way.
- Move me.

690
01:07:21,351 --> 01:07:23,020
Leon!

691
01:08:42,808 --> 01:08:46,019
- Peter, open the door!
- Who is it?

692
01:08:46,144 --> 01:08:48,105
It's me. Charley Brewster.
Let me in.

693
01:08:50,858 --> 01:08:53,652
- Are you one of them?
- What are you talking about?

694
01:08:53,777 --> 01:08:57,281
Here. Grab this.

695
01:09:03,662 --> 01:09:05,330
Come on.

696
01:09:06,373 --> 01:09:08,250
We don't have very much time.

697
01:09:08,375 --> 01:09:10,752
Dandrige chased me and Amy
all over town.

698
01:09:10,878 --> 01:09:13,380
He trapped us in a nightclub.

699
01:09:14,506 --> 01:09:16,800
- What are you doing?
- I'm leaving.

700
01:09:16,884 --> 01:09:19,094
- You can't!
- just watch me.

701
01:09:19,219 --> 01:09:21,471
But Dandrige has Amy!

702
01:09:21,597 --> 01:09:23,682
He's gonna kill her
unlesswe come to his house.

703
01:09:23,807 --> 01:09:27,311
Oh, my God. The police.
I'll call the police.

704
01:09:27,436 --> 01:09:30,898
No, Peter. No!
They won't believe you. I've tried.

705
01:09:32,024 --> 01:09:34,651
Peter, it's just us.

706
01:09:35,986 --> 01:09:38,488
We're gonna have to save Amy.

707
01:09:38,572 --> 01:09:40,490
I can't.

708
01:09:48,165 --> 01:09:49,541
I...

709
01:09:52,586 --> 01:09:55,797
was paid to be there today.

710
01:09:55,923 --> 01:09:57,883
I know.

711
01:09:58,926 --> 01:10:00,802
And you still want me
to help you?

712
01:10:00,928 --> 01:10:03,305
Yes!

713
01:10:03,430 --> 01:10:07,184
You're Peter Vincent,
the great vampire killer!

714
01:10:07,267 --> 01:10:09,686
That is a character in a movie!

715
01:10:11,355 --> 01:10:13,315
That isn't even my real name.

716
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:15,943
I'm terrified.

717
01:10:18,028 --> 01:10:20,405
I'm sorry, Charley, but I am.

718
01:10:26,036 --> 01:10:29,581
I can't do it alone, Peter.

719
01:10:30,707 --> 01:10:34,294
If you don't help,
Amy is gonna die.

720
01:10:34,378 --> 01:10:36,255
Me too, probably.

721
01:10:39,466 --> 01:10:41,385
Please, Peter.

722
01:10:45,973 --> 01:10:48,767
I'm sorry, Charley.

723
01:11:28,807 --> 01:11:32,853
She's someone I knew
a long time ago.

724
01:11:47,451 --> 01:11:49,161
Where am I?

725
01:11:53,123 --> 01:11:54,958
Where's Charley?

726
01:11:58,212 --> 01:11:59,379
Where?

727
01:14:48,382 --> 01:14:50,884
Peter Vincent.
Ready to do battle with the undead.

728
01:14:50,968 --> 01:14:52,469
This is serious.

729
01:14:52,553 --> 01:14:55,472
I am serious. Here.
Hold this. Go on.

730
01:14:59,226 --> 01:15:01,520
Let's see.
Flashlight, stakes, hammer.

731
01:15:01,645 --> 01:15:03,480
Ah, yes. Cross.

732
01:15:03,605 --> 01:15:05,899
What about Billy Cole?
How are you gonna stop him?

733
01:15:05,983 --> 01:15:09,152
I'm going to use this.
It is from Orgy ofthe Damned.

734
01:15:09,236 --> 01:15:12,781
What if he's not human?
Bullets aren't gonna stop him then.

735
01:15:12,865 --> 01:15:15,826
He walks around in the daylight,
now, doesn't he?

736
01:15:15,909 --> 01:15:17,244
- Hmm?
- Yeah.

737
01:15:17,369 --> 01:15:20,831
Well, then.
He is human. Come on.

738
01:15:20,914 --> 01:15:22,666
You don't have to do this.

739
01:15:22,791 --> 01:15:24,751
- I want to thank you--
- Not now.

740
01:15:30,841 --> 01:15:32,676
What's wrong?

741
01:15:34,469 --> 01:15:37,389
Nothing. Nothing at all.

742
01:15:41,435 --> 01:15:43,937
Are you crazy?

743
01:15:44,062 --> 01:15:45,939
Not the front door.

744
01:15:46,023 --> 01:15:48,108
Let's go around the back
and sneak in.

745
01:15:54,072 --> 01:15:55,949
Too late.

746
01:15:59,369 --> 01:16:02,831
I am Peter Vincent...

747
01:16:02,956 --> 01:16:04,791
the great vampire killer.

748
01:16:25,896 --> 01:16:27,731
This way.

749
01:16:42,454 --> 01:16:44,414
Did you hear something?

750
01:16:46,083 --> 01:16:47,584
No.

751
01:16:49,336 --> 01:16:52,756
Let's come back at dawn.
You see, he'll be asleep then.

752
01:16:52,881 --> 01:16:54,967
We'll have a better chance
of getting Amy.

753
01:16:55,092 --> 01:16:58,595
And Amy will be dead by then too.
Now come on.

754
01:17:14,862 --> 01:17:20,409
Welcome to Fright Night.

755
01:17:30,836 --> 01:17:32,796
For real.

756
01:17:34,047 --> 01:17:35,549
Where's Amy?

757
01:17:35,632 --> 01:17:37,926
Up here.

758
01:17:38,051 --> 01:17:40,554
All you have to do
is get by me.

759
01:17:44,308 --> 01:17:46,977
Back, spawn of Satan!

760
01:17:52,316 --> 01:17:54,610
Oh, really?

761
01:18:11,919 --> 01:18:14,505
You have to have faith...

762
01:18:14,630 --> 01:18:16,840
for this to work on me...

763
01:18:16,924 --> 01:18:19,009
Mr Vincent.

764
01:18:26,934 --> 01:18:29,102
Stop!

765
01:18:29,228 --> 01:18:30,354
Back

766
01:18:40,489 --> 01:18:42,032
We're gonna make it.

767
01:19:06,139 --> 01:19:07,891
Mrs Brewster!

768
01:19:13,647 --> 01:19:15,732
Operator, get me the--

769
01:19:24,408 --> 01:19:26,785
Thank God.
The phone wires have been cut.

770
01:19:30,330 --> 01:19:31,790
I know.

771
01:19:34,001 --> 01:19:35,836
I did it!

772
01:19:37,921 --> 01:19:39,840
Where is Charley's mother?

773
01:19:45,345 --> 01:19:50,267
Well, apparently
she's working nights.

774
01:19:51,393 --> 01:19:54,188
But she left a note.

775
01:20:04,114 --> 01:20:08,368
His dinner's in the oven!

776
01:23:34,116 --> 01:23:36,493
You wanted her.
There she is.

777
01:23:39,329 --> 01:23:42,166
Here. You're gonna need it.

778
01:23:42,249 --> 01:23:44,251
Just before dawn.

779
01:23:45,502 --> 01:23:47,588
What haveyou done to her?

780
01:26:03,015 --> 01:26:05,309
I'm gonna have to break
the door down.

781
01:26:05,392 --> 01:26:07,477
You make as much noise
asyou can.

782
01:26:09,563 --> 01:26:11,982
Help!

783
01:26:12,065 --> 01:26:14,151
Let me out!

784
01:26:15,652 --> 01:26:19,406
Please! Open the door!
Help! Somebody!

785
01:26:19,490 --> 01:26:22,910
I think she just opened her eyes.

786
01:26:29,082 --> 01:26:30,959
All right. Grab her.
Let's get out ofhere.

787
01:26:31,084 --> 01:26:33,462
We can't. Look

788
01:26:37,424 --> 01:26:39,092
Oh, my God.

789
01:26:41,929 --> 01:26:43,764
Something wrong?

790
01:26:43,889 --> 01:26:47,434
Yes. We have a visitor.

791
01:26:49,102 --> 01:26:51,522
Is it too late to save her?

792
01:26:51,605 --> 01:26:52,940
No.

793
01:26:54,191 --> 01:26:57,110
Not if we kill Dandrige
before dawn.

794
01:26:58,278 --> 01:26:59,947
Are you sure?

795
01:27:00,030 --> 01:27:02,449
So far, everything has been
like it was in movies.

796
01:27:02,533 --> 01:27:05,285
Now we just have to keep hoping.

797
01:27:08,288 --> 01:27:10,165
Let's go.

798
01:27:24,346 --> 01:27:27,266
Well, what do we have here?

799
01:27:29,226 --> 01:27:31,144
Vampire killers?

800
01:27:35,607 --> 01:27:37,067
Stop or I'll shoot.

801
01:27:39,153 --> 01:27:40,404
I mean it.

802
01:27:40,487 --> 01:27:42,489
Don't force me to shoot.

803
01:27:55,210 --> 01:27:56,253
Stop!

804
01:27:59,173 --> 01:28:00,757
We have him.

805
01:28:04,261 --> 01:28:06,263
Do you?

806
01:28:10,851 --> 01:28:12,853
What did he mean by that?

807
01:28:13,854 --> 01:28:16,481
Nothing.
He was just bluffing.

808
01:30:22,566 --> 01:30:23,901
She's worse!

809
01:30:23,984 --> 01:30:26,487
Come on.
We're running out oftime.

810
01:30:39,833 --> 01:30:41,752
Amy.

811
01:30:43,086 --> 01:30:44,463
Awake.

812
01:30:46,006 --> 01:30:49,009
I command you...

813
01:30:49,134 --> 01:30:53,013
to awake!

814
01:30:59,770 --> 01:31:04,775
Show me how much
you love me, Amy.

815
01:31:05,818 --> 01:31:08,320
Kill them...

816
01:31:09,488 --> 01:31:11,114
both!

817
01:31:18,539 --> 01:31:20,290
He's on the roof.

818
01:31:20,415 --> 01:31:22,292
I'm going up there.

819
01:31:53,365 --> 01:31:55,576
He's not up here.

820
01:31:55,659 --> 01:31:57,536
Look out!

821
01:32:00,038 --> 01:32:01,999
He's going downstairs.

822
01:32:15,470 --> 01:32:18,682
So.

823
01:32:31,528 --> 01:32:32,779
Stay back

824
01:32:37,993 --> 01:32:39,244
Back

825
01:32:50,631 --> 01:32:54,384
You have to have faith
for that to work..

826
01:32:54,468 --> 01:32:57,679
Mr Vincent!

827
01:32:57,804 --> 01:33:00,015
Remember?

828
01:33:43,267 --> 01:33:48,480
You're out oftime,
Mr Dandrige.

829
01:33:48,605 --> 01:33:50,691
Look overyour shoulder.

830
01:34:03,704 --> 01:34:05,038
Back!

831
01:34:46,121 --> 01:34:48,832
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. Quick He's in the basement.

832
01:34:59,676 --> 01:35:02,513
Quick his coffin has got to be
down here somewhere.

833
01:35:21,281 --> 01:35:22,741
What was that?

834
01:35:22,866 --> 01:35:25,536
You keep searching.
I'll check it out.

835
01:35:42,678 --> 01:35:44,304
Amy?

836
01:35:44,429 --> 01:35:46,515
It's me.

837
01:35:46,598 --> 01:35:47,891
I know.

838
01:36:08,328 --> 01:36:09,788
I found it.

839
01:36:11,748 --> 01:36:13,709
Don't be frightened, Charley.

840
01:36:13,834 --> 01:36:15,586
Hurry. Get it open!

841
01:36:15,711 --> 01:36:17,171
He's locked it
from the inside.

842
01:36:18,839 --> 01:36:20,215
What's wrong?

843
01:36:22,801 --> 01:36:26,221
Don't you want me any more?

844
01:36:32,811 --> 01:36:36,023
It's not my fault, Charley.

845
01:36:36,148 --> 01:36:40,444
You promised
you wouldn't let him get me!

846
01:36:40,527 --> 01:36:42,821
You promised!

847
01:38:27,634 --> 01:38:29,386
Charley, watch out!

848
01:39:34,368 --> 01:39:36,119
Amy!

849
01:41:24,770 --> 01:41:27,397
Look! We've been
going in a circle.

850
01:41:27,481 --> 01:41:29,566
We're right back
where we started from.

851
01:41:29,650 --> 01:41:34,154
Ladies and gentlemen,
Fright Night Theatre.

852
01:41:34,238 --> 01:41:36,448
This is Peter Vincent...

853
01:41:36,573 --> 01:41:39,493
back once more with you...

854
01:41:39,576 --> 01:41:42,079
as host of Fright Night.

855
01:41:42,162 --> 01:41:47,084
I thought I'd let the vampires
rest for a little while.

856
01:41:49,795 --> 01:41:51,255
Right, Charley?

857
01:41:52,840 --> 01:41:57,010
Tonight, the threat comes
not from beyond the grave...

858
01:41:57,094 --> 01:42:00,097
but from beyond the stars...

859
01:42:00,222 --> 01:42:04,393
as alien beings stalk
an unwary summer camp...

860
01:42:04,518 --> 01:42:08,272
in Mars Wants Flesh.

861
01:42:08,355 --> 01:42:11,358
I do not star in it.

862
01:42:34,006 --> 01:42:35,465
Is something wrong?

863
01:42:40,679 --> 01:42:42,639
Nothing.

864
01:43:01,533 --> 01:43:04,328
Oh, you're so cool, Brewster!

865
01:43:05,328 --> 01:43:15,328
