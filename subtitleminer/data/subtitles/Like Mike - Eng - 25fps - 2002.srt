1
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,071
Let's run it.

2
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:46,874
# Hand a double-O-P,
said crank it up # 

3
00:00:46,946 --> 00:00:48,208
# Shoot it up # 

4
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:50,044
# Hand a double-O-P,
come on, come on # 

5
00:00:50,116 --> 00:00:51,845
# Shoot it, shoot it # 

6
00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:53,715
# Sweep the faith, steal the ball # 

7
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:55,186
#  Turkey, what they are # 

8
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:57,052
#  Get out the way, fancy turn # 

9
00:00:57,123 --> 00:00:58,818
# Fake likeJohnson, boss like Bird # 

10
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,325
# Pass the rock likeJason Kidd # 

11
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:02,418
# He got the scoop,
that's what you done # 

12
00:01:02,495 --> 00:01:03,723
# And the crowd goes wild # 

13
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:05,856
# Hand a double-O-P,
said crank it up # 

14
00:01:05,932 --> 00:01:07,593
# Shoot it up # 

15
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:09,100
# Hand a double-O-P,
come on, come on # 

16
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:10,363
# Shoot it, shoot it # 

17
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:11,665
#  Gonna listen to
the whole light eight # 

18
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:14,002
# I know we're facin'
a 3-point situation # 

19
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:16,099
#  With the face of time
and with the game on the line # 

20
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:18,041
#  Go for a free throw,
the championship's mine # 

21
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:19,578
#  Take it to the hole,
let me do my duty # 

22
00:01:19,646 --> 00:01:21,580
# Perfect swish # 

23
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,985
Hey, punk.

24
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,051
I been thinkin'...

25
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:31,682
You been thinkin'?
That's a change of pace.

26
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,123
Got a pretty big mouth
for someone so...

27
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:34,455
- Don't say it.
- So short.

28
00:01:34,527 --> 00:01:35,619
He ain't short!

29
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:37,356
I'm not short.
I'm just height-challenged.

30
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,556
What's height-challenged?

31
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:39,791
Better than bein' brain-challenged.

32
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:41,458
You wanna back that
big mouth up of yours

33
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:42,796
and play me one-on-one
for your jersey?

34
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:43,961
Ox, leave him alone!

35
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:45,470
What's the matter, Calvin?

36
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:46,903
Don't push Murph, man.

37
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:48,406
Would you guys just stop this?

38
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:49,737
Calvin, let's just go.

39
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:50,798
No, no.
Let me handle this.

40
00:01:50,877 --> 00:01:52,071
Exactly how are you
gonna handle this?

41
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:54,807
Listen, if I say no...

42
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:56,371
He beats you up.

43
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:57,973
OK. Now, if I say yes...

44
00:01:58,051 --> 00:01:59,143
He still beats you up.

45
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:00,948
And you'll lose your jersey.

46
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,578
Listen...

47
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:04,247
I can take him.

48
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:07,088
I mean, Kobe wouldn't back down
from no challenge.

49
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,094
Allen Iverson wouldn't back down
from no challenge.

50
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:12,256
And MichaelJordan sure as heck
is not backin' down from no challenge,

51
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:13,959
And neither is Calvin Cambridge.

52
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:15,091
E- Excuse me.

53
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,567
Take a number, Ox,

54
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:20,970
'cause you're about to be served.

55
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,147
Theyjust don't
make these things

56
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:41,091
for... normal-sized people,
you know?

57
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,629
That's gotta hurt.

58
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:45,129
Go on ahead and laugh
if you want,

59
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:47,029
but you guys won't be laughing
when I get 5 new jerseys

60
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,567
from the family
who's gonna adopt me.

61
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:50,626
You ain't gettin' adopted.

62
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:52,136
Yes, I will,
'cause I have a destiny.

63
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:55,333
All orphans are special.
All orphans have destinies.

64
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:57,876
Maybe in books,
but you wanna name a real one?

65
00:02:57,944 --> 00:02:59,138
Moses.

66
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,747
And Nelson Mandela
and Marilyn Monroe

67
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:03,907
and Daunte Culpepper.

68
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:05,814
Who plays in the NFL.

69
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:07,819
James Avery:
This calls for champagne.

70
00:03:07,887 --> 00:03:09,184
Man...

71
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:12,281
I want a family like that
to adopt me.

72
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:15,987
Look how theyjust
get along with each other.

73
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:18,121
That's what I really want.

74
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,895
Kid: Oh, man,
why'd you do that?

75
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:23,833
All right. Kids...

76
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:26,064
let's get to work.

77
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:27,106
Murph:Fresh candy.

78
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:28,140
Reg:Please?

79
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,539
Right here.

80
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:32,100
Hi. Would you like to
buy some candy, ma'am?

81
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:33,509
Hi. What about you?

82
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,310
Fresh candy. $2.00.

83
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:38,179
Hey, you guys wanna
buy some candy?

84
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:39,980
If you don't buy, I don't eat.

85
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,384
Hey, you want some candy?

86
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:43,115
Reg:It's for
the Chesterfield group home.

87
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:44,315
Calvin:
Candy bar, anybody?

88
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,789
Can we have some candy?

89
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:46,790
Please, Daddy?

90
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:48,121
No. We'll get treats inside.

91
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:51,823
Girls, don't ever give money
to a kid like this. It's a big scam.

92
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:00,104
Joad is down low.!
He's open.!

93
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:02,164
Tracy Reynolds,
you need to pass the ball!

94
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,005
But Tracy shoots!

95
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,806
Both:
And it's nothin' but...

96
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:07,846
rim.

97
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,007
And the Knights lose by one.

98
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:13,280
What was Tracy Reynolds thinking?

99
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:14,581
No! No!

100
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:15,678
Man!

101
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,586
Look at the coach.

102
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:18,851
He's on fiire!

103
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,859
Let's go back to work, man.

104
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,417
Go back to work?

105
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:26,261
Nobody buys when we lose, Murph.

106
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:33,470
Man,you didn't even
sell half your candy.

107
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:36,099
We could lose
our TV privileges... again.

108
00:04:36,175 --> 00:04:37,972
Is that Coach Wagner?

109
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:39,909
I think so.

110
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:41,947
S- Stay right here.
I'll be right back.

111
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:43,141
Valet: You have a good one.

112
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:44,740
Thank you.

113
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,385
Hey, coach.

114
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:50,718
Bet you could use some candy
after that one.

115
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:51,757
Tough loss.

116
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:53,553
You shoulda seen it up close.

117
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:54,888
You had it won!

118
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,553
You diagrammed the perfect play!

119
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:58,563
Sure, Harrison didn't
set the low pick,

120
00:04:58,631 --> 00:04:59,996
but why didn't Tracy
pass the ball?

121
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:04,264
Son... that is one for the ages.

122
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:07,038
Hey, wait a minute.

123
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:08,733
It's 10:00.
It's a school night.

124
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,742
Do your parents know
you're out this late?

125
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,244
I'm an orphan.

126
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,247
And I'm out here selling candy

127
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,943
so that I can raise money
for the group home.

128
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:20,645
Oh. Well...

129
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,416
listen, how 'bout this, uh...

130
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:26,981
will that get me
a chocolate bar?

131
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:40,472
No.

132
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,634
I can't charge you, coach.

133
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,803
I don't even know
if the money really goes

134
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:47,903
to the...
to the group home.

135
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,650
What's your name, son?

136
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:54,443
My name is Calvin.

137
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,454
Calvin Cambridge.

138
00:05:56,522 --> 00:06:00,322
Calvin, have you ever seen
the Knights play in the arena?

139
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:01,417
No, sir.

140
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:03,018
Well, since you won't take my money,

141
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:05,621
how about if I get you some tickets
for Sunday's game?

142
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:06,995
Really?

143
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:08,624
You can pick 'em up at will call.

144
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:11,295
I will! Thanks, coach.
Nice talking to you.

145
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,770
Murph!

146
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:25,979
Hello. Good to see you.

147
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:29,249
There's, uh, children everywhere, so...

148
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:41,596
He's so adorable.

149
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:44,101
I'm feelin' good about this, y'all.

150
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,434
Today's the day
I'm gonna get adopted.

151
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:49,168
You ain't gettin' adopted.
None of us are.

152
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,437
Face it. We're like dogs.

153
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:53,979
Parents only want the puppies.

154
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:08,285
So much for me being special.

155
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:11,455
Hey, things could change.
I mean, your destiny could be right here

156
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:12,998
and you don't even know it.

157
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:16,000
Calvin!
Where are you going?

158
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:18,229
Off to do that history homework

159
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:20,238
you owe me since yesterday?

160
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:22,035
Yes, Sister Theresa.

161
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:25,043
OK, Murph,

162
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,976
there is a winter coat here

163
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:29,742
that's just right for you.

164
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:31,545
Try it on.

165
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:37,645
Sister Theresa,

166
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:40,351
do you know anything
about these shoes right here?

167
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:41,552
I'm not sure.

168
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,095
It's a perfect fiit.

169
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:49,930
Well, the guy
who dropped them off

170
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:53,460
said they used to belong
to some famous basketball player

171
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:54,972
when he was a kid.

172
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,339
Um... which...
which basketball player?

173
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:58,934
Uh...

174
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:00,706
you know, the...

175
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,270
the tall bald one.

176
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:09,877
MJ.

177
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:13,855
Murph, Reg, come here, look.

178
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:15,359
Look at the shoes.

179
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:16,622
MJ.

180
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:19,124
MJ?

181
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:21,393
All: It can't be.

182
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:23,799
MichaelJordan?
Was it MichaelJordan?

183
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,770
Go. Do your homework.

184
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:31,708
It's gotta be! MichaelJordan
wore these sneakers, man.

185
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:34,871
Did you say...
MichaelJordan?

186
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:36,346
Yeah. I said MichaelJordan.
Give 'em back.

187
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:38,474
They could be anybody's.
Let me take a look.

188
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:40,018
No, man.
They're his, man.

189
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:41,678
Yeah, how do you know
they're not?

190
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:43,187
'Cause no one ever gives us
nothin' good.

191
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:46,020
Just abandoned junk
that no one wants.

192
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:47,024
Like us.

193
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:48,355
Murph: We're not junk.

194
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:49,485
Well, I want 'em!

195
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:50,654
Oh, yeah?

196
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,664
Then go get 'em.

197
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:38,610
I want those sneakers.

198
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:40,009
Murph!

199
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:42,713
Murph!

200
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:47,479
- Hmm?
- Wake up!

201
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:50,826
I gotta get those sneakers.

202
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,520
Suppose Ox is right
and they're not MJ's.

203
00:09:53,596 --> 00:09:55,587
They are MJ's sneakers.

204
00:09:55,664 --> 00:09:56,824
I know they are.

205
00:09:56,899 --> 00:09:59,197
Then we'll get 'em in the morning.

206
00:09:59,268 --> 00:10:01,168
Not in the morning.
Not while Ox is around.

207
00:10:01,237 --> 00:10:03,171
Besides, they'll get ruined in the rain.

208
00:10:03,239 --> 00:10:04,433
I gotta get 'em now!

209
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,812
Well, Calvin,

210
00:10:15,885 --> 00:10:19,082
seems like a really great idea.

211
00:10:25,861 --> 00:10:27,328
Unh.

212
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:47,107
Aah!

213
00:10:47,183 --> 00:10:48,810
Calvin, be careful.!

214
00:10:48,884 --> 00:10:50,215
Don't fall!

215
00:10:59,728 --> 00:11:01,423
Ohh.

216
00:11:29,158 --> 00:11:30,090
Oh.

217
00:11:33,629 --> 00:11:35,563
Ohh!

218
00:11:39,635 --> 00:11:41,694
Whoa.

219
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,554
The tickets were there
just like Coach Wagner said.

220
00:12:00,623 --> 00:12:02,147
I can't believe we're gonna see
a real NBA game.

221
00:12:02,224 --> 00:12:03,521
Oh, me, neither.

222
00:12:03,592 --> 00:12:04,650
How'd you get those tickets?

223
00:12:04,727 --> 00:12:05,751
We just did.

224
00:12:05,828 --> 00:12:06,954
I'm telling Bittleman.

225
00:12:07,029 --> 00:12:10,760
Ox, you can rat on us to Mr. B,

226
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:14,234
but, uh, you'll miss the game, too.

227
00:12:18,908 --> 00:12:20,466
Yeah! Yeah!

228
00:12:22,678 --> 00:12:25,579
He just dunked the ball!
He dunked the ball!

229
00:12:29,351 --> 00:12:31,911
Geoff Witcher:
The Knights have one more chance here

230
00:12:31,987 --> 00:12:33,648
to chip away at this lead
before halftime.

231
00:12:33,722 --> 00:12:35,690
They're not shooting well.

232
00:12:35,758 --> 00:12:37,521
Open at the wing is Reynolds.

233
00:12:37,593 --> 00:12:38,924
He puts it up...

234
00:12:38,994 --> 00:12:41,292
Oh, no good.

235
00:12:41,363 --> 00:12:43,388
Oh, man.

236
00:12:43,465 --> 00:12:45,262
Reynolds misses another shot,

237
00:12:45,334 --> 00:12:47,461
and that's the end of the fiirst half.

238
00:12:47,536 --> 00:12:50,004
Minnesota Timberwolves
out in front of the Knights by 12,

239
00:12:50,072 --> 00:12:51,369
and once again,

240
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,635
the Knights did not play
very good basketball

241
00:12:53,709 --> 00:12:55,973
in the fiirst half.

242
00:12:57,079 --> 00:12:59,070
Hey, good half.
Good half.

243
00:12:59,148 --> 00:13:00,945
Good half.
We're in great shape.

244
00:13:01,016 --> 00:13:03,678
Great shape.
We'll win it back. Yeah.

245
00:13:03,752 --> 00:13:05,049
Henderson, attaboy.

246
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,520
It's permissible to run in this game,
incidentally.

247
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:12,027
Yeah. Dvigatsya, Krilov.
Dvigatsya. Yeah.

248
00:13:12,094 --> 00:13:14,460
Man: Tracy.

249
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:17,021
Tracy Reynolds,
hey, what a wizard.

250
00:13:17,099 --> 00:13:18,862
You're a magician out there tonight.

251
00:13:18,934 --> 00:13:20,026
Small favor.

252
00:13:20,102 --> 00:13:22,730
Oh, no. No, no.
I don't do halftime shows, man.

253
00:13:22,805 --> 00:13:24,295
I'm not some chalupa giveaway.

254
00:13:24,373 --> 00:13:26,307
Hey, those chalupas
upped attendance by 4,000.

255
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:28,809
You're familiar with Mr. Granger,

256
00:13:28,877 --> 00:13:30,037
the man who owns the team?

257
00:13:30,112 --> 00:13:32,842
I have a very good relationship
with Mr. Granger.

258
00:13:32,915 --> 00:13:34,906
He hasn't called me in 4 years.

259
00:13:34,984 --> 00:13:35,916
He called this morning.

260
00:13:35,985 --> 00:13:37,509
And he's ready to clean house

261
00:13:37,586 --> 00:13:40,146
if we don't put some asses
in those seats.

262
00:13:40,222 --> 00:13:42,986
Hello, Los Angeles!

263
00:13:43,058 --> 00:13:46,186
And welcome
to your halftime show!

264
00:13:46,261 --> 00:13:49,287
Tonight, some lucky fan
will get the chance

265
00:13:49,365 --> 00:13:52,357
to go one-on-one
with Tracy Reynolds,

266
00:13:52,434 --> 00:13:55,403
the straw that stirs
your L.A. Knights.

267
00:13:57,406 --> 00:14:00,375
Yeah, T-time, baby! Yeah!

268
00:14:00,442 --> 00:14:02,137
Check your ticket stubs.

269
00:14:02,211 --> 00:14:05,772
If your number is called,
come on down!

270
00:14:05,848 --> 00:14:07,748
And bring your 'A"game.!

271
00:14:07,816 --> 00:14:10,376
Drumroll, please.

272
00:14:14,289 --> 00:14:15,483
Come on.

273
00:14:19,128 --> 00:14:21,722
Whoa. Oh,jeez.

274
00:14:29,171 --> 00:14:30,638
I have the winning ticket.

275
00:14:30,706 --> 00:14:33,800
Getting excited, Tracy?

276
00:14:33,876 --> 00:14:36,777
Yeah. Yeah, very excited.

277
00:14:36,845 --> 00:14:39,405
Well, so am I.

278
00:14:39,481 --> 00:14:41,745
And here we go.

279
00:14:41,817 --> 00:14:43,444
"Section 4... "

280
00:14:45,621 --> 00:14:47,851
"row 14... "

281
00:14:48,991 --> 00:14:50,515
That's our row, that's our row.

282
00:14:50,592 --> 00:14:53,083
"Seat 2. "

283
00:14:54,697 --> 00:14:57,188
I got the ticket!

284
00:14:57,266 --> 00:14:59,461
Come on down!
Show us what you got!

285
00:14:59,535 --> 00:15:00,763
Naw, I got the ticket.

286
00:15:00,836 --> 00:15:02,804
Listen, you little runt,
if you can't score on me,

287
00:15:02,871 --> 00:15:03,838
how you gonna get by a Knight?

288
00:15:03,906 --> 00:15:06,500
Oh, shoot, here come a redcoat.
Security.

289
00:15:06,575 --> 00:15:07,507
Psych!

290
00:15:07,576 --> 00:15:09,100
Stop.

291
00:15:17,886 --> 00:15:21,219
And here comes our winner now.

292
00:15:31,066 --> 00:15:34,092
All right. Heh heh.

293
00:15:34,169 --> 00:15:38,902
Well... boy,
this is gonna be some contest.

294
00:15:39,975 --> 00:15:41,442
Well, son,

295
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:42,807
what's your name?

296
00:15:42,878 --> 00:15:46,279
Ahem.
Ca... Calvin Cambridge.

297
00:15:46,348 --> 00:15:50,114
Well, Calvin,
I'd like you to meet Tracy Reynolds.

298
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,684
Man, this is... this is crazy.

299
00:15:53,756 --> 00:15:54,688
This is so cool.

300
00:15:54,757 --> 00:15:55,781
How you doin', little man?

301
00:15:55,858 --> 00:15:57,052
Tracy.

302
00:15:57,126 --> 00:15:58,058
All right.

303
00:15:58,127 --> 00:16:01,290
I'm playing Tracy.
I'm playing...

304
00:16:01,363 --> 00:16:02,625
I can't even say it.
I'm so happy.

305
00:16:02,698 --> 00:16:04,962
I'm playing T-time.

306
00:16:05,033 --> 00:16:07,228
Wait a minute.
Was this supposed to do that?

307
00:16:09,138 --> 00:16:10,537
Man, this is kind of loud.

308
00:16:10,606 --> 00:16:12,335
Hey, stand up.
Can you hear me?

309
00:16:12,407 --> 00:16:13,738
- Murph, stand up.
- Calvin!

310
00:16:13,809 --> 00:16:14,798
I can't hear you.

311
00:16:14,877 --> 00:16:16,811
Calvin, up here!

312
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:17,971
I still can't hear you.

313
00:16:18,046 --> 00:16:20,606
Jump up and down
like a rabbit or something.

314
00:16:20,682 --> 00:16:22,547
The crowd is eating this up.
Don't embarrass the kid.

315
00:16:22,618 --> 00:16:23,880
Let him score twice.

316
00:16:23,952 --> 00:16:24,884
Once.

317
00:16:24,953 --> 00:16:25,920
Twice!

318
00:16:25,988 --> 00:16:27,979
Once.

319
00:16:28,056 --> 00:16:30,217
Hey, Murph,
we gotta get one of these.

320
00:16:30,292 --> 00:16:34,160
OK, OK, Calvin.
Very good.

321
00:16:34,229 --> 00:16:36,857
Now, you're gonna
have 60 seconds, OK?

322
00:16:36,932 --> 00:16:39,025
Let's get the show
on the road!

323
00:16:39,101 --> 00:16:41,035
All right, all right.
You ready, little man?

324
00:16:41,103 --> 00:16:42,968
Man:Hey, kid, tie your shoe.

325
00:16:43,038 --> 00:16:44,198
Thank you, sir.

326
00:16:44,273 --> 00:16:47,299
We like our players to be loose,
not their laces.

327
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:54,141
Make me like Mike.

328
00:16:57,186 --> 00:17:00,246
OK... go!

329
00:17:01,523 --> 00:17:04,788
Good luck to you, all right?
Here we go.

330
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,054
Whoo-hoo. Hoo-hoo.

331
00:17:06,128 --> 00:17:07,322
Aw.

332
00:17:07,396 --> 00:17:08,920
- You like that?
- I'm jealous.

333
00:17:08,997 --> 00:17:11,056
- Whoo-hoo.
- Aw, OK.

334
00:17:11,133 --> 00:17:12,600
Got that?

335
00:17:17,706 --> 00:17:19,401
Very nice.

336
00:17:19,474 --> 00:17:22,739
Calvin has just won himself
an L.A. Knights sweatshirt.

337
00:17:23,812 --> 00:17:26,042
Computer: Chessmaster 2000.

338
00:17:26,114 --> 00:17:28,810
Would you like to play a game?

339
00:17:28,884 --> 00:17:29,942
And we begin.

340
00:17:30,018 --> 00:17:32,145
Pawn to queen 4.

341
00:17:32,221 --> 00:17:33,984
That was really nice.
That was really nice.

342
00:17:34,056 --> 00:17:36,217
Really? Thanks.

343
00:17:38,227 --> 00:17:40,354
Can't go that way.
Can't go that way.

344
00:17:41,997 --> 00:17:43,589
I didn't know it was like that.

345
00:17:43,665 --> 00:17:44,927
Yeah, you didn't know
it was like that?

346
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,025
Uh-huh, can't go that way, either.
Come on, now.

347
00:17:47,102 --> 00:17:48,797
Tracy Reynolds.
Man, I play "D."

348
00:17:48,871 --> 00:17:50,771
That's what I'm playing.

349
00:17:54,176 --> 00:17:55,108
Oh.

350
00:17:55,177 --> 00:17:56,109
Whoa.

351
00:17:56,178 --> 00:17:57,338
Oh.

352
00:17:57,412 --> 00:17:59,175
Whoo!

353
00:17:59,248 --> 00:18:01,409
How did I do that?

354
00:18:01,483 --> 00:18:03,246
Now, how did he do that?

355
00:18:03,318 --> 00:18:05,286
He just won a signed basketball
with an impressive 30-footer.

356
00:18:05,354 --> 00:18:06,582
That one was sweet, wasn't it?

357
00:18:06,655 --> 00:18:10,523
Nobody said nothing about this kid
embarrassing me out here.

358
00:18:10,592 --> 00:18:13,083
That's your last shot, little man.
Recess is over.

359
00:18:13,161 --> 00:18:14,526
Bernard: One more shot,

360
00:18:14,596 --> 00:18:17,121
and he wins $ 1,000.

361
00:18:17,199 --> 00:18:18,826
Tracy Reynolds, baby.
You got what, 9 seconds?

362
00:18:18,901 --> 00:18:19,833
Let's do it.

363
00:18:19,902 --> 00:18:20,834
I'm really sorry...

364
00:18:20,903 --> 00:18:22,598
It's all right, little man.

365
00:18:22,671 --> 00:18:23,797
Come on, little man.
Come on.

366
00:18:23,872 --> 00:18:26,670
Come on, what you got?

367
00:18:26,742 --> 00:18:28,107
It's my gym, baby.

368
00:18:29,311 --> 00:18:30,676
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

369
00:18:30,746 --> 00:18:32,714
Back. OK.

370
00:18:32,781 --> 00:18:33,975
Uh-huh.

371
00:18:46,962 --> 00:18:48,623
Y... es.

372
00:18:48,697 --> 00:18:49,891
Computer:Pawn takes Knight.

373
00:18:49,965 --> 00:18:50,897
Hah!

374
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:04,540
All right, Calvin!

375
00:19:04,613 --> 00:19:06,012
Whoo!

376
00:19:17,292 --> 00:19:18,554
Yeah.

377
00:19:30,605 --> 00:19:32,800
Go, Calvin!

378
00:19:43,585 --> 00:19:47,021
I guess this would be a bad time
for me to ask for your autograph, huh?

379
00:19:52,494 --> 00:19:54,621
Hi there! Oh.

380
00:19:54,696 --> 00:19:56,721
Playing a little checkers I see, huh?

381
00:19:56,798 --> 00:19:58,356
Computer:Error. Error.

382
00:19:58,433 --> 00:19:59,832
I was about to win.

383
00:19:59,901 --> 00:20:02,841
So, are you the man I see
about Calvin Cambridge?

384
00:20:02,974 --> 00:20:04,737
OK, let me get this straight...

385
00:20:04,809 --> 00:20:08,438
You guys want to
have Calvin play for the Knights?

386
00:20:08,513 --> 00:20:09,775
Right.

387
00:20:09,848 --> 00:20:11,213
Why?

388
00:20:11,282 --> 00:20:13,716
I been coaching 35 years.

389
00:20:13,785 --> 00:20:15,753
This is the most ridiculous thing
I've ever heard of.

390
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:18,721
Well, you didn't see him
play at halftime.

391
00:20:20,392 --> 00:20:21,359
Hey, coach.

392
00:20:21,426 --> 00:20:24,224
Hi... again.

393
00:20:24,295 --> 00:20:25,592
Am I gonna be a Knight?

394
00:20:29,501 --> 00:20:31,298
He's 41 I2 feet tall.

395
00:20:31,369 --> 00:20:32,427
I know.

396
00:20:33,605 --> 00:20:36,733
Can you imagine the press
we're gonna get?

397
00:20:36,808 --> 00:20:39,174
Look, coach, I know attendance
is in the crapper, OK,

398
00:20:39,244 --> 00:20:42,042
and I'm not averse to using
the word "gimmick. "

399
00:20:42,113 --> 00:20:43,637
This is about making money.

400
00:20:44,716 --> 00:20:49,050
I see. And speaking of money...

401
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,678
Ah, yes, money.

402
00:20:50,755 --> 00:20:54,555
Mr. Bittleman,
I'm prepared to make you an offer

403
00:20:54,626 --> 00:20:59,654
of $5,000
for a one-day contract.

404
00:20:59,731 --> 00:21:02,029
Ah... well.

405
00:21:03,234 --> 00:21:08,171
Uh, seeing that
I'm Calvin's guardian,

406
00:21:08,239 --> 00:21:10,070
uh...

407
00:21:10,141 --> 00:21:13,235
I do have to make certain
that nobody takes advantage of him.

408
00:21:13,311 --> 00:21:15,541
You mean except for you?

409
00:21:15,613 --> 00:21:17,672
Hey, I resent that.

410
00:21:17,749 --> 00:21:21,685
Uh, Mr. Bittleman, uh, perhaps,
uh, perhaps, uh...

411
00:21:21,753 --> 00:21:24,244
an extra 2,500 might help

412
00:21:24,322 --> 00:21:26,449
ease your worries.

413
00:21:26,524 --> 00:21:27,616
Deal.

414
00:21:27,692 --> 00:21:29,216
Good.

415
00:21:29,294 --> 00:21:33,230
I always knew that there was
something special about Calvin.

416
00:21:33,298 --> 00:21:34,663
Wow, man, you're on the Knights.

417
00:21:34,732 --> 00:21:36,393
I can't believe you're gonna
get to play in the NBA.

418
00:21:36,468 --> 00:21:38,265
I still can't believe
what happened to me yesterday.

419
00:21:38,336 --> 00:21:40,236
Whatever I wanted to do
with the rock, I could do.

420
00:21:40,305 --> 00:21:42,671
Whatever I wanted to do
on the court, I could do.

421
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:43,672
And there he was...

422
00:21:43,741 --> 00:21:45,675
Tracy Reynolds, NBA superstar...

423
00:21:45,743 --> 00:21:46,937
and I outplayed him.

424
00:21:47,011 --> 00:21:49,707
Yeah, man.
And you hit that "J." Fade-away.

425
00:21:49,781 --> 00:21:52,272
Calvin: That was a swish.
That was a swish.

426
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:53,783
You alley-ooped yourself
off the backboard.

427
00:21:53,852 --> 00:21:55,114
Reg: Yeah, that was hot.

428
00:22:04,896 --> 00:22:06,659
But... how?

429
00:22:06,731 --> 00:22:08,562
That's a good question.

430
00:22:08,633 --> 00:22:13,332
I don't know.
All I know is that before I had these...

431
00:22:13,404 --> 00:22:15,565
All: Sneakers.

432
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,234
I couldn't play like that
if my life depended on it.

433
00:22:18,309 --> 00:22:20,800
Murph, hand me that ball.

434
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:31,014
Man...

435
00:22:31,089 --> 00:22:35,321
you're like some
weird basketball Cinderella.

436
00:22:35,393 --> 00:22:37,884
Yeah, and the clock's
gonna strike midnight

437
00:22:37,962 --> 00:22:39,259
if somebody fiinds out.

438
00:22:43,635 --> 00:22:46,365
Wow, I wish I was going with you.

439
00:22:46,437 --> 00:22:47,495
Me, too.

440
00:22:47,572 --> 00:22:50,006
We'll be rooting for you.

441
00:22:50,074 --> 00:22:51,507
- Come on, let's go.
- Yeah.

442
00:23:04,055 --> 00:23:05,352
Hey, everybody.

443
00:23:06,591 --> 00:23:09,560
Hey, Trace, you need
to get your notebook out

444
00:23:09,627 --> 00:23:12,528
'cause the kid is back
to school you again.

445
00:23:12,597 --> 00:23:14,997
Ha ha ha. Your mama.

446
00:23:16,701 --> 00:23:18,362
Hey, Tracy, look,
I'm sorry about the other day.

447
00:23:18,436 --> 00:23:20,063
No, no, no.
It's all right, little man.

448
00:23:20,138 --> 00:23:21,400
No need to be sorry, all right?
You got lucky.

449
00:23:21,472 --> 00:23:22,734
It's all right.

450
00:23:22,807 --> 00:23:25,708
Hey, I'm Joad.

451
00:23:25,777 --> 00:23:27,335
Why don't you take
the locker next to mine?

452
00:23:29,647 --> 00:23:31,672
Here's your uniform, Calvin.

453
00:23:31,749 --> 00:23:33,842
Special ordered...
ofiicial shirt, shorts,

454
00:23:33,918 --> 00:23:36,318
socks, and sneakers.

455
00:23:36,387 --> 00:23:39,481
Uh, but I like my own sneakers.

456
00:23:39,557 --> 00:23:43,516
Oh... ours aren't good enough
for the kid.

457
00:23:43,595 --> 00:23:45,790
No, it's nothing like that.

458
00:23:45,863 --> 00:23:47,660
It's just that
I play better in mine.

459
00:23:47,732 --> 00:23:50,496
Play?
You just have to look good.

460
00:23:54,239 --> 00:23:56,400
What do you mean?

461
00:24:02,046 --> 00:24:05,277
Coach, may I please
ask you a question?

462
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:07,079
Sure.

463
00:24:07,151 --> 00:24:10,120
Coach, I have a lot of friends
here tonight, and, uh...

464
00:24:10,188 --> 00:24:15,023
I was just wondering...
wondering, am I here to play,

465
00:24:15,093 --> 00:24:17,493
or am I just here for show?

466
00:24:21,633 --> 00:24:24,796
Calvin, I'm gonna
be straight with you.

467
00:24:24,869 --> 00:24:29,033
You were hired tonight
just to increase attendance,

468
00:24:29,107 --> 00:24:30,335
not to play.

469
00:24:30,408 --> 00:24:31,568
Man.

470
00:24:31,643 --> 00:24:33,907
But... I saw the tape

471
00:24:33,978 --> 00:24:37,106
of that halftime show
you put on.

472
00:24:37,181 --> 00:24:39,274
You got some game.

473
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:43,377
I am honored
to have you on my team.

474
00:24:44,522 --> 00:24:46,285
Thanks, coach.

475
00:24:46,357 --> 00:24:48,120
You bet.

476
00:24:52,363 --> 00:24:53,759
Whoo.!

477
00:25:00,838 --> 00:25:02,999
Geoff: We've got a bigger
than usual crowd tonight,

478
00:25:03,074 --> 00:25:04,564
and a lot of it is curiosity.

479
00:25:04,642 --> 00:25:06,041
The Knights have a brand new player.

480
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:08,670
He's 4-foot, 8-inch Calvin Cambridge,

481
00:25:08,746 --> 00:25:12,739
joining us straight from the playground
of the Chesterfield group home.

482
00:25:12,817 --> 00:25:14,250
Reggie, your reaction.

483
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:16,014
Geoff, this is unprecedented.

484
00:25:16,087 --> 00:25:19,284
I can't imagine what the Knights players
are thinking. We'll see what happens.

485
00:25:19,357 --> 00:25:20,517
We're gonna fiind out shortly.

486
00:25:20,591 --> 00:25:21,819
Both clubs are taking the court

487
00:25:21,893 --> 00:25:24,589
as we get ready
for tonight's opening tip.

488
00:25:24,662 --> 00:25:26,721
Go Knights!

489
00:25:37,308 --> 00:25:38,332
What was that?!

490
00:25:40,878 --> 00:25:42,436
Admiral! Admiral!

491
00:25:47,218 --> 00:25:48,276
The admiral just waved at me.

492
00:25:48,353 --> 00:25:51,254
He just waved at me.
Admiral!

493
00:25:51,322 --> 00:25:52,448
Hey...

494
00:25:58,463 --> 00:26:00,158
Come on! Hey! Hey!

495
00:26:00,231 --> 00:26:01,994
Geoff: Coach Wagner of the Knights
has seen enough.

496
00:26:02,066 --> 00:26:04,466
He wants and gets a time-out.

497
00:26:06,838 --> 00:26:09,602
Let's go. Let's go.
Good hustle, baby.

498
00:26:09,674 --> 00:26:10,698
What?

499
00:26:13,678 --> 00:26:16,772
Come on, guys.
It's not funny.

500
00:26:16,848 --> 00:26:20,511
Now, offense, is there any play
that's gonna work for us tonight?

501
00:26:20,585 --> 00:26:21,552
I have an idea.

502
00:26:21,619 --> 00:26:23,246
Oh, man.

503
00:26:23,321 --> 00:26:25,084
I've been watching,

504
00:26:25,156 --> 00:26:26,680
and they're vulnerable
from the weak side,

505
00:26:26,758 --> 00:26:28,191
especially to a pick set
away from the hoop.

506
00:26:30,294 --> 00:26:31,522
Why don't we run
the give-and-give-and-go?

507
00:26:31,596 --> 00:26:32,927
You mean
the give-and-go?

508
00:26:32,997 --> 00:26:34,931
No, see,
they'll be expecting that.

509
00:26:34,999 --> 00:26:37,263
Have Tracy feed the ball
to Henderson.

510
00:26:37,335 --> 00:26:38,597
Henderson's gonna
feed the ball toJoad.

511
00:26:38,669 --> 00:26:40,227
Joad's gonna pass it
back to Tracy.

512
00:26:40,304 --> 00:26:41,931
As Henderson sets the pick,

513
00:26:42,006 --> 00:26:44,668
Tracy's gonna take the shot.

514
00:26:47,812 --> 00:26:49,074
I like it.

515
00:26:49,147 --> 00:26:50,512
Oh, no. No.
I'm not gonna run some play

516
00:26:50,581 --> 00:26:51,707
by some snotty-nosed kid, man.

517
00:26:51,783 --> 00:26:54,047
Damn straight, coach.

518
00:26:54,118 --> 00:26:55,881
Fine. Henderson, you're out.

519
00:26:55,953 --> 00:26:57,215
Tracy, you take Henderson's slot.

520
00:26:57,288 --> 00:26:59,222
Calvin, you take the shot.

521
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:00,314
What?

522
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:13,437
Have you lost your mind?

523
00:27:13,504 --> 00:27:17,201
- You said I could play anybody I want.
- Yeah, well, I didn't mean him.

524
00:27:17,275 --> 00:27:18,765
Am I the coach or not?

525
00:27:18,843 --> 00:27:21,038
You are. For now.

526
00:27:21,112 --> 00:27:22,374
Can you believe it, Reggie?

527
00:27:22,447 --> 00:27:24,506
It looks like
the kid's gonna play.

528
00:27:31,322 --> 00:27:33,950
A rousing welcome
for the man they came to see,

529
00:27:34,025 --> 00:27:35,754
the little fella,
Calvin Cambridge,

530
00:27:35,827 --> 00:27:36,919
into the game for the Knights.

531
00:27:50,308 --> 00:27:53,209
Calvin! Run the play!

532
00:27:56,914 --> 00:27:59,280
What's he doin'?

533
00:28:01,819 --> 00:28:03,411
- Run the play.
- No.

534
00:28:03,488 --> 00:28:05,615
Would you just run the play?

535
00:28:07,124 --> 00:28:08,989
Time out! White!

536
00:28:10,628 --> 00:28:11,788
Why'd you call time out?

537
00:28:11,863 --> 00:28:13,660
Uh... I gotta pee.

538
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,192
He's gotta pee.

539
00:28:17,268 --> 00:28:19,498
Announcer:
Calvin Cambridge is calling for

540
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:21,197
a bathroom break?

541
00:28:21,272 --> 00:28:24,036
I guess when you gotta go,
Reggie,you gotta go.

542
00:28:50,234 --> 00:28:51,166
Yes!

543
00:28:55,406 --> 00:28:56,600
The crowd is roaring.

544
00:28:56,674 --> 00:28:57,902
That can mean just one thing.

545
00:28:57,975 --> 00:29:00,068
That little guy,
Calvin Cambridge,

546
00:29:00,144 --> 00:29:02,203
has taken care ofbusiness
in the locker room

547
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,440
and is back on the court.

548
00:29:03,514 --> 00:29:04,481
He's done.

549
00:29:26,837 --> 00:29:29,271
Ladies and gentlemen,
this kid's for real.

550
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,865
He can play some basketball.

551
00:29:31,943 --> 00:29:34,411
#  Tied up, tied up # 

552
00:29:34,478 --> 00:29:38,173
#  You got me so # 

553
00:29:39,584 --> 00:29:42,348
# Doo doo do-do-do-do
do-do-do-do-do # 

554
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:46,356
# Do-do-do doo doo
do-doo # 

555
00:29:46,424 --> 00:29:50,258
# Doo doo do-do-do-do
do-do-do-do-do # 

556
00:29:50,328 --> 00:29:52,592
# Do-do-do doo doo
do-doo # 

557
00:29:57,708 --> 00:30:00,142
Slam dunk over David Robinson.!

558
00:30:00,211 --> 00:30:01,974
Unbelievable.!

559
00:30:02,046 --> 00:30:05,311
12 seconds to go,
the Knights trail by 2.

560
00:30:05,382 --> 00:30:07,441
Trying to fiind some way
to actually come back

561
00:30:07,518 --> 00:30:08,985
and win this thing.

562
00:30:21,098 --> 00:30:24,033
It's good.! The Knights win.!

563
00:30:34,144 --> 00:30:36,510
Am I a genius or what? Huh?

564
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:39,014
Tell me I'm a genius!

565
00:30:40,251 --> 00:30:43,709
Announcer:
This is the NBA on NBC.

566
00:30:45,222 --> 00:30:46,780
The big story in the NBA:

567
00:30:46,857 --> 00:30:49,382
Calvin Cambridge,
the 4-foot-8 dynamo,

568
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:51,325
has now signed
a lucrative contract

569
00:30:51,395 --> 00:30:52,327
with the Knights.

570
00:30:52,396 --> 00:30:53,658
And no wonder,
after he led them

571
00:30:53,731 --> 00:30:56,529
to a come-from-behind win
over the Spurs with 27 points?

572
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,090
That kid was unbelievable.

573
00:30:58,168 --> 00:31:00,227
Did I just see
the admiral saluting him

574
00:31:00,304 --> 00:31:01,430
at the end of the game?

575
00:31:01,505 --> 00:31:02,870
You know, Cambridge's
contract makes him

576
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,737
the youngest,
and the shortest person

577
00:31:04,808 --> 00:31:06,571
ever to sign a deal
with the NBA.

578
00:31:06,644 --> 00:31:08,908
He's lean, he's mean, he's 13.

579
00:31:08,979 --> 00:31:10,446
Yeah, now all the kids
are gonna be saying,

580
00:31:10,514 --> 00:31:11,674
"I wanna be like Calvin. "

581
00:31:11,749 --> 00:31:12,738
Well, I guarantee you one thing,

582
00:31:12,816 --> 00:31:14,750
this orphan
will not be an orphan for long.

583
00:31:17,288 --> 00:31:20,280
I can't believe you're going on the road
with the Knights.

584
00:31:20,357 --> 00:31:22,086
Can I fiit in your suitcase?

585
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:23,558
Hey, what about me?

586
00:31:25,062 --> 00:31:25,994
Bittleman.

587
00:31:27,898 --> 00:31:30,628
Hey, Calvin, this is great.

588
00:31:30,701 --> 00:31:33,363
Well, uh, I'm proud of you.

589
00:31:33,437 --> 00:31:35,701
Listen, uh, when you're on the road,

590
00:31:35,773 --> 00:31:38,105
uh, people might want to adopt you.

591
00:31:38,175 --> 00:31:41,667
But you should realize it's, uh,

592
00:31:41,745 --> 00:31:43,508
only because you're a celebrity now,

593
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:46,105
and, uh, they're just after your money.

594
00:31:46,183 --> 00:31:50,813
Besides,your contract forbids it.

595
00:31:50,888 --> 00:31:52,287
Wait a minute. Forbids it?

596
00:31:54,291 --> 00:31:57,055
Oh, yeah.
Didn't I tell you?

597
00:31:57,127 --> 00:32:00,858
Uh, I signed your contract
as your guardian,

598
00:32:00,931 --> 00:32:05,095
so, um, as long as
you're playing for the Knights,

599
00:32:05,169 --> 00:32:08,195
that can't change.

600
00:32:15,412 --> 00:32:16,902
Hey, coach, check this out!

601
00:32:18,882 --> 00:32:20,213
Pretty good.

602
00:32:25,422 --> 00:32:28,619
Welcome to
Self-Hypnosis for the Fearful Flier.

603
00:32:28,692 --> 00:32:30,660
During today's peaceful flight,

604
00:32:30,728 --> 00:32:31,695
you'll transport
yourself into a state...

605
00:32:31,762 --> 00:32:32,694
Tracy.

606
00:32:32,763 --> 00:32:34,253
What?

607
00:32:34,331 --> 00:32:36,663
Relax. Flight's fiine.

608
00:32:36,734 --> 00:32:37,826
Just came by to say hello.

609
00:32:37,901 --> 00:32:39,892
OK, my bad. I'm sorry.

610
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:43,167
You are familiar
with the NBA mentoring program,

611
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,764
are you not?

612
00:32:44,842 --> 00:32:46,104
Oh, no. No. No. No.

613
00:32:46,176 --> 00:32:47,165
You don't even know
what I'm gonna ask.

614
00:32:47,244 --> 00:32:48,506
No, I do know
what you're gonna ask,

615
00:32:48,579 --> 00:32:49,603
and it's not gonna happen.

616
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,612
You're trying to punish me.

617
00:32:50,681 --> 00:32:51,978
No.

618
00:32:53,851 --> 00:32:55,842
The kid's rooming with you.

619
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:57,784
I think it would be good
for both of you.

620
00:32:58,856 --> 00:33:00,153
We're goin' down!

621
00:33:02,926 --> 00:33:05,190
Whoa. Whoa.

622
00:33:07,031 --> 00:33:09,522
No. No. No.
There is no way in the world

623
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,726
I'm gonna be roomin' with that kid.

624
00:33:10,801 --> 00:33:12,291
I'm callin' my agent.
You know why?

625
00:33:12,369 --> 00:33:13,427
'Cause it ain't gonna happen.

626
00:33:15,739 --> 00:33:17,730
This gonna be so cool
roomin' together.

627
00:33:17,808 --> 00:33:20,333
Uh, my boy Murph
says I snore.

628
00:33:20,411 --> 00:33:21,810
I think he has to be
trippin' sometimes.

629
00:33:21,879 --> 00:33:23,005
Maybe we could
rent NBA Street.

630
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,310
Or if you don't like that,
we could play Monopoly.

631
00:33:25,382 --> 00:33:26,440
Or if you don't like Monopoly,

632
00:33:26,517 --> 00:33:29,247
then we couldjust sit around and rap,
because I love to talk.

633
00:33:29,319 --> 00:33:30,650
Oh, yeah, I noticed.

634
00:33:30,721 --> 00:33:32,746
Have fun, Tracy.

635
00:33:33,824 --> 00:33:35,018
All right, look.

636
00:33:35,092 --> 00:33:36,252
Coach says I gotta room with you,

637
00:33:36,326 --> 00:33:37,987
so let me set down the rules
right now.

638
00:33:38,062 --> 00:33:40,087
First of all,
I ain't your boy, OK?

639
00:33:40,164 --> 00:33:41,222
I'm not gonna be playin'
Monopoly with you,

640
00:33:41,298 --> 00:33:42,492
Game Cube, Rubik's Cube...

641
00:33:42,566 --> 00:33:44,056
Anything with a cube,
I ain't playin'.

642
00:33:44,134 --> 00:33:46,602
Third, you know, I'm not gonna
be tuckin' you in at night,

643
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:47,796
and I'm defiinitely
not gonna read you

644
00:33:47,871 --> 00:33:49,532
the Three Little Bears,
you got that?

645
00:33:50,607 --> 00:33:53,007
Whoa! Look at this!

646
00:33:53,077 --> 00:33:55,841
Do we always
stay in places this fancy?

647
00:33:55,913 --> 00:33:57,005
Mm-hmm.

648
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,868
OK.

649
00:34:18,936 --> 00:34:20,096
All right, I'm goin' out.

650
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:23,970
Oh, um, w-would you
like some company?

651
00:34:24,041 --> 00:34:26,236
No. No,
I wouldn't like company.

652
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:28,335
Well, what do I do?

653
00:34:28,412 --> 00:34:31,381
Uh, well, um...

654
00:34:31,448 --> 00:34:33,678
oh, call room service,
get some food.

655
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:36,810
But what's room service?

656
00:34:36,887 --> 00:34:39,253
Right. Right. OK.
Here's what you do.

657
00:34:40,457 --> 00:34:41,389
You pick up this phone, right?

658
00:34:41,458 --> 00:34:42,447
Mm-hmm.

659
00:34:42,526 --> 00:34:44,517
And you dial "6".
Tell them what you want

660
00:34:44,595 --> 00:34:47,996
and they'll bring it
to the room... for free.

661
00:34:48,065 --> 00:34:48,997
For free?

662
00:34:49,066 --> 00:34:50,658
For free.
You got it. Eat up.

663
00:34:50,734 --> 00:34:53,202
No, you gotta be
messin' with me, right?

664
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:55,204
No, I'm not.
Try it yourself.

665
00:34:55,272 --> 00:34:56,204
For free.

666
00:34:59,309 --> 00:35:00,173
Hello?

667
00:35:00,244 --> 00:35:03,008
Uh, yes.
Um, is this room service?

668
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,012
Yes, it is.

669
00:35:04,081 --> 00:35:05,207
And will you really

670
00:35:05,282 --> 00:35:06,715
bring me up
some food for free?

671
00:35:06,783 --> 00:35:08,876
Well, sure.
Anything you like, sir.

672
00:35:08,952 --> 00:35:10,749
You will?

673
00:35:10,821 --> 00:35:12,880
OK, um, in that case,
I'll have a pepperoni pizza,

674
00:35:12,956 --> 00:35:15,982
french fries, and cake,
ice cream, and lobster tails.

675
00:35:16,059 --> 00:35:17,219
Lots oflobster, lots of seafood.

676
00:35:17,294 --> 00:35:19,762
Chicken fiingers, french fries...

677
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:27,901
Ah, man.

678
00:35:32,943 --> 00:35:34,308
Um, you know what?
Let me...

679
00:35:34,378 --> 00:35:35,902
I just want to clean up
just a little, OK?

680
00:35:35,979 --> 00:35:37,003
Well, that's OK.

681
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,274
No. No. No. I just
want to clean up this...

682
00:35:38,348 --> 00:35:39,747
Hey, you're so beautiful,
I have to clean up for you.

683
00:35:39,816 --> 00:35:40,805
No, it's all right.

684
00:35:40,884 --> 00:35:42,374
OK, so I'll be right back.

685
00:35:42,452 --> 00:35:44,886
Calvin, I need you...

686
00:35:44,955 --> 00:35:46,013
Calvin, what are you doing?

687
00:35:46,089 --> 00:35:47,488
What are you making such a mess for?

688
00:35:47,558 --> 00:35:50,789
You were right about room service.

689
00:35:50,861 --> 00:35:52,089
OK, Calvin. Calvin.

690
00:35:54,031 --> 00:35:55,965
Know what?
I need you to get lost.

691
00:35:56,033 --> 00:35:57,967
OK? I don't care where you go,
just get lost.

692
00:35:58,035 --> 00:35:59,093
Joad wants to play NBA Street.

693
00:35:59,169 --> 00:36:01,569
No, Calvin, not in there.
Calvin, no! Calvin!

694
00:36:01,638 --> 00:36:03,037
Calvin! Calvin!

695
00:36:03,106 --> 00:36:05,074
Calvin! Calvin!

696
00:36:05,142 --> 00:36:06,439
Hey.

697
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:07,442
Hey, you know what?

698
00:36:07,511 --> 00:36:08,910
The maid forgot to come today

699
00:36:08,979 --> 00:36:10,139
and, you know,
maybe we could go to your place?

700
00:36:10,214 --> 00:36:11,806
Is someone else in here?

701
00:36:11,882 --> 00:36:13,747
Because I thought
I heard some voices.

702
00:36:13,817 --> 00:36:15,182
Oh, there's... Really.
There's no one in there.

703
00:36:15,252 --> 00:36:17,413
Oh, my God.

704
00:36:17,487 --> 00:36:18,419
Oh, where'd he come from?

705
00:36:18,488 --> 00:36:21,013
You're Calvin Cambridge,
aren't you?

706
00:36:21,091 --> 00:36:22,752
Oh, my God.
Are you OK?

707
00:36:22,826 --> 00:36:24,054
We're gonna get you
out of these clothes

708
00:36:24,127 --> 00:36:25,151
and get you some air, OK?

709
00:36:25,229 --> 00:36:27,094
Oh, brother. Here we go.

710
00:36:28,966 --> 00:36:33,027
Oh! You are just
the sweetest thing!

711
00:36:33,103 --> 00:36:35,264
Isn't he just the sweetest thing?

712
00:36:38,342 --> 00:36:40,742
Tracy, you should have told me
Calvin was your roommate.

713
00:36:40,811 --> 00:36:43,006
Yeah, well,
it must have slipped my mind.

714
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,775
See, me and Tracy are tight.

715
00:36:44,848 --> 00:36:46,975
So that's why I call him T-time.

716
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:48,847
So cute.

717
00:36:48,919 --> 00:36:53,185
So, what's your nickname for Calvin,
T- time?

718
00:36:53,257 --> 00:36:54,952
I don't have one yet,

719
00:36:55,025 --> 00:36:57,357
but, oh, so many of them
come to mind.

720
00:36:58,829 --> 00:37:00,387
Is that better, baby?

721
00:37:00,464 --> 00:37:02,591
Yeah, I think T-time needs some, too.

722
00:37:02,666 --> 00:37:05,726
Oh! Ha ha!

723
00:37:05,802 --> 00:37:07,235
$2,000 jacket.

724
00:37:07,304 --> 00:37:09,499
Gettin' water on a $2,000 jacket.

725
00:37:09,573 --> 00:37:11,268
Couldn't you just eat him up?

726
00:37:13,443 --> 00:37:15,536
Sorry about taking your girl.

727
00:37:15,612 --> 00:37:17,773
She's not my girl,
and you didn't take her.

728
00:37:17,848 --> 00:37:20,282
I don't know what it is.
It's like some type of curse.

729
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:22,181
The girls just like me.

730
00:37:23,253 --> 00:37:24,379
Can we go to sleep?

731
00:37:24,454 --> 00:37:25,751
Well, aren't we gonna
say our prayers?

732
00:37:25,822 --> 00:37:27,915
'Cause at the home
we always say our prayers.

733
00:37:27,991 --> 00:37:29,117
We're not at the home.

734
00:37:29,192 --> 00:37:31,422
Well, I can't go to sleep
until I say my prayers.

735
00:37:31,495 --> 00:37:32,928
Then say your prayers.

736
00:37:32,996 --> 00:37:34,361
All right.

737
00:37:37,401 --> 00:37:40,199
Well, aren't you gonna
say 'em with me?

738
00:37:45,008 --> 00:37:47,977
Bow your head.
Bow your head.

739
00:37:51,515 --> 00:37:52,743
Both:
Now I lay me down to sleep,

740
00:37:52,816 --> 00:37:54,078
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

741
00:37:54,151 --> 00:37:55,550
If I should die before I wake,

742
00:37:55,619 --> 00:37:57,917
I pray the Lord my soul to take.
Amen.

743
00:37:57,988 --> 00:37:59,580
God bless Murph,
God bless Reg,

744
00:37:59,656 --> 00:38:00,953
God bless Coach Wagner,

745
00:38:01,024 --> 00:38:02,457
God bless MichaelJordan,

746
00:38:02,526 --> 00:38:06,189
and God bless Tracy.

747
00:38:06,263 --> 00:38:08,128
Amen.

748
00:38:11,368 --> 00:38:12,995
Anybody that you want to bless?

749
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:14,765
A girlfriend, or your parents, maybe?

750
00:38:14,838 --> 00:38:16,669
No, my parents are gone.

751
00:38:19,776 --> 00:38:21,141
Hey, um...

752
00:38:23,347 --> 00:38:25,178
I'm sorry.

753
00:38:25,248 --> 00:38:27,512
I guess that makes you
an orphan like me.

754
00:38:28,985 --> 00:38:31,579
Yeah, I guess.

755
00:38:31,655 --> 00:38:33,282
Why don't you get in bed?

756
00:38:36,393 --> 00:38:38,020
All right.
Good night.

757
00:38:41,465 --> 00:38:43,023
There's just one thing.

758
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:44,727
Can we sleep with the light on?

759
00:38:44,801 --> 00:38:45,733
'Cause at the home

760
00:38:45,802 --> 00:38:46,894
we always sleep with the light on.

761
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:49,404
OK, we'll sleep with the light on.
Satisfiied?

762
00:38:49,473 --> 00:38:51,270
I don't wanna hear
another sound tonight, OK?

763
00:38:51,341 --> 00:38:53,536
Good night.

764
00:39:10,227 --> 00:39:11,489
Oh, man.

765
00:39:14,264 --> 00:39:16,164
What's the matter, Tracy?
Late night?

766
00:39:16,233 --> 00:39:18,827
Yeah, real late night. Heh.

767
00:39:18,902 --> 00:39:19,960
Ain't that right, Trace?

768
00:39:20,036 --> 00:39:21,901
Really? How late?

769
00:39:21,972 --> 00:39:25,601
See, there's this girl named Janet Kelly
came up to the room, fiine as can be.

770
00:39:25,675 --> 00:39:27,768
She picked me and Tracy up.

771
00:39:27,844 --> 00:39:31,041
We didn't come back to the room
about 1:00 in the morning.

772
00:39:31,114 --> 00:39:32,775
He doesn't know better,

773
00:39:32,849 --> 00:39:34,908
but you know the rule
about the ladies in the room,

774
00:39:34,985 --> 00:39:38,045
and last time I checked,
curfew was midnight.

775
00:39:38,121 --> 00:39:39,952
No, it was his snorin'
that kept me up all night.

776
00:39:40,023 --> 00:39:42,014
Oh, you always got an excuse.

777
00:39:42,092 --> 00:39:44,560
Look, if you think
helping him break curfew

778
00:39:44,628 --> 00:39:46,186
is gonna get you
out ofbein'his mentor,

779
00:39:46,263 --> 00:39:47,696
you're mistaken...

780
00:39:47,764 --> 00:39:49,425
and if you miss curfew again,

781
00:39:49,499 --> 00:39:51,899
I'm gonna have
to suspend you. Got it?

782
00:39:51,968 --> 00:39:53,401
Yeah, I got it.

783
00:39:56,139 --> 00:39:57,231
You know what, man?

784
00:39:57,307 --> 00:39:58,467
You got to learn how to chill.

785
00:39:58,542 --> 00:40:01,177
Tracy, I'm so sorry.
I didn't know.

786
00:40:01,311 --> 00:40:02,107
Don't worry, man.

787
00:40:02,178 --> 00:40:03,167
I won't mess up again.
I promise.

788
00:40:03,246 --> 00:40:04,338
Yeah, I know
it's not gonna happen again.

789
00:40:04,414 --> 00:40:05,847
You know why?
Because you're gonna go your way,

790
00:40:05,915 --> 00:40:07,940
and I'm gonna go my way.

791
00:40:08,018 --> 00:40:11,852
Tracy, we still gonna be cool
on the court, though, right?

792
00:40:15,558 --> 00:40:16,786
Man.

793
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:35,643
Um, Mr. Iverson, sir,

794
00:40:35,712 --> 00:40:37,873
uh,you're one
of my favorite players.

795
00:40:37,947 --> 00:40:39,676
Who are you, the mascot?

796
00:40:39,749 --> 00:40:42,183
I was wondering,
may I please have your autograph, man?

797
00:40:42,252 --> 00:40:44,379
Players don't ask players
for autographs.

798
00:40:44,454 --> 00:40:46,319
- Player?
- After the game?

799
00:40:58,935 --> 00:41:00,163
How'd he do that?

800
00:41:01,471 --> 00:41:05,999
#  They're playin'basketball # 

801
00:41:06,076 --> 00:41:10,274
#  We love that basketball # 

802
00:41:10,346 --> 00:41:14,510
#  They're playin'basketball # 

803
00:41:14,584 --> 00:41:18,748
#  We love that basketball # 

804
00:41:18,822 --> 00:41:23,418
#  They're playin'basketball # 

805
00:41:23,493 --> 00:41:24,482
Calvin Cambridge,

806
00:41:24,561 --> 00:41:27,029
25 points a game.
Not tonight.

807
00:41:27,097 --> 00:41:28,029
You just need to get back

808
00:41:28,098 --> 00:41:29,895
to that sandbox
where you came from.

809
00:41:29,966 --> 00:41:30,990
- Sandbox?
- Yeah.

810
00:41:31,067 --> 00:41:31,965
How you gonna say
I gotta go to the sandbox?

811
00:41:32,035 --> 00:41:32,967
Your last name's Kidd.

812
00:41:33,036 --> 00:41:34,367
Look at the back of your jersey. Look.

813
00:41:34,437 --> 00:41:35,961
Relax.
See what you got.

814
00:41:38,475 --> 00:41:40,705
Pat Croce:All of a sudden,
things are clickin'for the Knights.

815
00:41:40,777 --> 00:41:42,802
Ever since Calvin's arrived,
there's teamwork.

816
00:41:42,879 --> 00:41:45,177
So what's is it like
for you two playin'together?

817
00:41:45,248 --> 00:41:47,580
Well, um, it's been, uh...

818
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:50,448
It's been great!
Really great!

819
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:55,981
#  We love that basketball # 

820
00:41:56,059 --> 00:41:57,788
# Now basketball is my favorite sport # 

821
00:41:57,861 --> 00:42:00,421
# I like the way they dribble
up and down the court # 

822
00:42:00,497 --> 00:42:02,260
# I keep it so fresh on the microphone # 

823
00:42:02,332 --> 00:42:04,493
# I like no interruption
when the game is on # 

824
00:42:04,567 --> 00:42:05,864
# I got the rock in my hands # 

825
00:42:05,935 --> 00:42:07,402
# Ain't no tellin'
what I'm gonna do wit it # 

826
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:09,961
#  When I got possession,
I'm gonna have to fool wit it # 

827
00:42:10,039 --> 00:42:11,529
Personally, I'm worried about

828
00:42:11,608 --> 00:42:13,701
steppin' on
Calvin Cambridge tonight.

829
00:42:13,777 --> 00:42:15,108
# ... and fake one way # 

830
00:42:15,178 --> 00:42:17,112
#  Turn around and hit you
with the MJ fade-away # 

831
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:18,477
Come on, ref!

832
00:42:18,548 --> 00:42:20,675
Jump ball.!

833
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:23,685
# ... passes likeJ-Kidd,
taking cats to the rack # 

834
00:42:23,753 --> 00:42:24,742
# And I'm dunkin'
over them like T-Mac # 

835
00:42:24,821 --> 00:42:25,879
#  When I'm in the paint # 

836
00:42:25,955 --> 00:42:27,115
# I play with that Alonzo style # 

837
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:28,919
# My favorite play is the alley-oop # 

838
00:42:28,992 --> 00:42:31,187
# I like the pick-n-roll,
I like the give-n-go # 

839
00:42:31,261 --> 00:42:33,092
# And it's basketball,
bow wow, let's go # 

840
00:42:33,163 --> 00:42:37,031
#  They're playin'basketball # 

841
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:39,261
Calvin, these people
are not your friends, OK?

842
00:42:39,335 --> 00:42:42,600
They're like...
They're like a pack of tigers, you know,

843
00:42:42,672 --> 00:42:45,505
chasing those things
with the stubby little horns.

844
00:42:45,575 --> 00:42:47,839
You know,
you've seen those deer-like things,

845
00:42:47,911 --> 00:42:49,469
and they isolate one of them,

846
00:42:49,546 --> 00:42:50,672
and then they pounce!

847
00:42:50,747 --> 00:42:52,271
Good to see ya.

848
00:42:53,349 --> 00:42:54,816
Female Reporter:
Calvin, over here.!

849
00:42:54,884 --> 00:42:56,010
Male Reporter: Calvin.!

850
00:42:56,085 --> 00:42:57,211
I've seen Calvin play,

851
00:42:57,287 --> 00:42:59,517
and, uh, he's nothin'
that I can't handle.

852
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:09,495
Reg: Thanks, Calvin.
These are great.

853
00:43:09,566 --> 00:43:11,500
Wow, thanks, Calvin.

854
00:43:11,568 --> 00:43:13,092
No problem.
Enjoy it, everybody.

855
00:43:14,604 --> 00:43:16,196
Get Bittleman!

856
00:43:16,272 --> 00:43:17,796
Reg and Murph:
Yeah, get him!

857
00:43:17,874 --> 00:43:20,843
# Basketball # 

858
00:43:20,910 --> 00:43:24,437
#  We love that basketball # 

859
00:43:30,186 --> 00:43:32,746
We have twins.

860
00:43:32,822 --> 00:43:34,414
Hey.

861
00:43:34,490 --> 00:43:36,151
Hey, Calvin.

862
00:43:36,226 --> 00:43:38,319
Listen, man.
Uh, can I get your autograph?

863
00:43:38,394 --> 00:43:39,827
Sure, Dirk.

864
00:43:39,896 --> 00:43:41,329
Uh, it's actually for my niece.

865
00:43:41,397 --> 00:43:42,329
What's her name?

866
00:43:42,398 --> 00:43:45,697
Uh, it's, uh, Dirk.

867
00:43:45,768 --> 00:43:48,862
Yes, it's Calvin Cambridge
bobblehead doll night,

868
00:43:48,938 --> 00:43:52,999
but everybody's wondering
what's keeping the Knights?

869
00:43:53,076 --> 00:43:56,512
"Who were the U.S. Presidents
of the 20th century?"

870
00:43:56,579 --> 00:43:59,446
Can't she wait till after the game
for his homework?

871
00:43:59,515 --> 00:44:00,948
No homework, no game.

872
00:44:01,017 --> 00:44:02,211
But I've gotta get Cal...

873
00:44:02,285 --> 00:44:03,411
You got a problem with that?

874
00:44:05,188 --> 00:44:07,088
I got dogs bigger than him, man.

875
00:44:07,156 --> 00:44:09,818
Look like a little chihuahua
or somethin' like that. Come on.

876
00:44:15,298 --> 00:44:17,061
- Oh!
- Oh!

877
00:44:17,133 --> 00:44:21,570
#  They're playin'basketball # 

878
00:44:21,638 --> 00:44:26,871
#  We love that basketball # 

879
00:44:26,943 --> 00:44:31,573
Announcer: Welcome to
the NBA slam dunk competition.

880
00:44:31,648 --> 00:44:33,673
Beautiful.!

881
00:44:37,186 --> 00:44:38,585
Oh!

882
00:44:38,655 --> 00:44:40,816
Announcer:
Big vertical leap.!

883
00:44:40,890 --> 00:44:42,858
Next up, 4-foot 8-inch
Calvin Cambridge.

884
00:44:44,394 --> 00:44:46,225
The little guy is flying.!

885
00:44:47,530 --> 00:44:49,760
Cambridge wins it.!

886
00:44:54,237 --> 00:44:55,169
Calvin.

887
00:44:56,239 --> 00:44:57,171
Calvin.

888
00:44:58,241 --> 00:44:59,208
Calvin.

889
00:45:02,245 --> 00:45:05,703
I was wondering.
What is it like to be famous?

890
00:45:06,783 --> 00:45:10,549
Ah. It's all right.

891
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:13,453
You know, um...

892
00:45:13,523 --> 00:45:16,754
You know the celebrities
you see on Oprah

893
00:45:16,826 --> 00:45:18,885
complainin'about how tough it is?

894
00:45:18,962 --> 00:45:23,865
They must be crazy. I mean,
I'm gettin'paid to play in the NBA.

895
00:45:23,933 --> 00:45:25,924
The crowd loves me.

896
00:45:26,002 --> 00:45:28,630
I get room service.

897
00:45:28,705 --> 00:45:31,606
I got everything I ever wanted.

898
00:45:32,709 --> 00:45:36,736
Well, almost.

899
00:45:39,082 --> 00:45:40,674
Go back to sleep, all right?

900
00:45:45,254 --> 00:45:47,017
What are you doin'?
Get off!

901
00:45:47,090 --> 00:45:48,352
I'm takin' a look
at these MJ sneakers.

902
00:45:48,424 --> 00:45:49,356
Man, you ain't gettin' em.

903
00:45:49,425 --> 00:45:50,449
Gimme the sneakers!

904
00:45:50,526 --> 00:45:51,458
Gimme the sneakers.

905
00:45:51,527 --> 00:45:54,121
Come on, Ox. Get off.

906
00:45:54,197 --> 00:45:55,528
Get off! Hold Murph.

907
00:45:55,598 --> 00:45:57,361
Stop!

908
00:45:57,433 --> 00:45:58,525
Gimme the sneakers!

909
00:45:58,601 --> 00:46:01,161
You can't have 'em!
Get off my sneakers, man!

910
00:46:01,237 --> 00:46:02,169
Get off him!

911
00:46:02,238 --> 00:46:03,330
Gimme your sneakers, Calvin!

912
00:46:03,406 --> 00:46:04,805
- Get off my sneakers!
- Hey!

913
00:46:04,874 --> 00:46:07,001
Hey, hey! Stop! Get off!

914
00:46:07,076 --> 00:46:08,737
Get off Calvin!

915
00:46:08,811 --> 00:46:10,904
Do not hurt Calvin!

916
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:13,505
What are you doing?
Are you OK?

917
00:46:13,583 --> 00:46:15,210
Look, do not hurt him.

918
00:46:15,284 --> 00:46:16,774
Do you know how valuable
he is to me?

919
00:46:16,853 --> 00:46:18,411
It's his sneakers.
That's how he can play so well.

920
00:46:18,488 --> 00:46:20,080
You lay one more hand on him,

921
00:46:20,156 --> 00:46:22,522
and you're sleeping in the basement.

922
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:27,825
All right, everybody.

923
00:46:27,897 --> 00:46:28,921
Go to sleep.

924
00:46:28,998 --> 00:46:30,829
It's all over.

925
00:46:33,002 --> 00:46:34,970
Good night.

926
00:46:39,108 --> 00:46:40,336
Joad: Come on.
Get outta the way.

927
00:46:40,410 --> 00:46:42,708
No, I'm in fiirst place.
Why would I let you by?

928
00:46:42,779 --> 00:46:45,748
Oh. I ain't see, why you got your...
My hand ain't all in your face.

929
00:46:45,815 --> 00:46:48,113
What's with the bumpin', man?

930
00:46:48,184 --> 00:46:49,412
I'm about to win the Daytona Cup.

931
00:46:49,485 --> 00:46:50,417
Get outta the way.

932
00:46:50,486 --> 00:46:51,418
Oh! Whoo!
Who's your daddy?

933
00:46:51,487 --> 00:46:52,749
That's only 5, man.

934
00:46:52,822 --> 00:46:54,619
You can't get me 6 in a row.
No way.

935
00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:57,557
Hey, T-time.
I just whupped on Joad again.

936
00:46:57,627 --> 00:46:59,754
See, I call Tracy "T-time. "
Hey, T-time,

937
00:46:59,829 --> 00:47:01,296
how come you haven't
given me a nickname yet?

938
00:47:01,364 --> 00:47:02,388
I don't know.

939
00:47:02,465 --> 00:47:03,955
See, I've been thinkin'
about somethin' like

940
00:47:04,033 --> 00:47:07,935
"C-square," or "C-cam,"
or "C-bridge. "

941
00:47:08,004 --> 00:47:09,028
I'm gonna pick up
some allergy medicine.

942
00:47:09,105 --> 00:47:10,538
I might pick up some sleeping pills

943
00:47:10,606 --> 00:47:12,540
so you don't keep me up
with your snorin' all night.

944
00:47:12,608 --> 00:47:15,441
Oh, um... well, uh,

945
00:47:15,511 --> 00:47:16,603
can I go?

946
00:47:16,679 --> 00:47:18,374
Heh. Well, uh, no.

947
00:47:20,049 --> 00:47:23,109
Hey, um, Trace,
but, um, well, I...

948
00:47:24,821 --> 00:47:26,254
Dang.

949
00:47:26,322 --> 00:47:27,584
Don't take it personally, Cal.

950
00:47:27,657 --> 00:47:28,954
He doesn't even like to spend time
with his own family.

951
00:47:29,025 --> 00:47:31,619
- Family?
- Yeah.

952
00:47:31,694 --> 00:47:33,218
I thought he didn't have any parents.

953
00:47:33,296 --> 00:47:35,161
No, he's still got his dad.

954
00:47:35,231 --> 00:47:36,858
Hejust doesn't talk to him.

955
00:47:39,335 --> 00:47:40,893
Radio Deejay:
Sacramento, capital city,

956
00:47:40,970 --> 00:47:42,665
hip-hop's super station.

957
00:47:42,738 --> 00:47:45,866
Oh. Oh,yeah.
This is my song right here.

958
00:47:45,942 --> 00:47:47,910
#  Y'all gonna make me lose my mind # 

959
00:47:47,977 --> 00:47:49,945
# Up in here, up in here #

960
00:47:50,012 --> 00:47:51,172
Go, X! Ha!

961
00:47:51,247 --> 00:47:55,081
# Go all out, up in here,
up in here #

962
00:47:55,151 --> 00:47:57,415
#Y'all gonna make me act a fool #

963
00:47:57,487 --> 00:47:59,955
# Up in... #
Oh!

964
00:48:00,022 --> 00:48:01,614
What you doin' here, Calvin?

965
00:48:01,691 --> 00:48:03,249
Stairs are faster than the elevator.

966
00:48:03,326 --> 00:48:06,261
Dang, your rappin's despicable.
Terrible.

967
00:48:06,329 --> 00:48:08,354
Sound like MichaelJackson
with a sore throat, man.

968
00:48:08,431 --> 00:48:09,955
Oh, my rappin' sucks?
OK, can you do better?

969
00:48:10,032 --> 00:48:11,465
Let me see you do better.

970
00:48:11,534 --> 00:48:13,968
#To be messin' with me,
you... you ain't strong enough #

971
00:48:14,036 --> 00:48:17,130
# So y'all gonna make me
act the fool, up in #

972
00:48:17,206 --> 00:48:20,642
#What? What? What-What? #

973
00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:21,938
Cal.

974
00:48:22,011 --> 00:48:22,978
Calvin, Calvin, Calvin.

975
00:48:23,045 --> 00:48:24,774
Stick to playin' basketball, man.

976
00:48:24,847 --> 00:48:26,712
'Cause you know why?
'Cause you can't rap.

977
00:48:26,782 --> 00:48:27,840
You can do better?

978
00:48:27,917 --> 00:48:28,849
I can do better.

979
00:48:28,918 --> 00:48:30,010
Let me see you do some.

980
00:48:30,086 --> 00:48:32,486
# Up in here, up in here #

981
00:48:32,555 --> 00:48:34,955
#Y'all gonna make me lose my mind #

982
00:48:35,024 --> 00:48:37,322
# Up in here, up in here #

983
00:48:37,393 --> 00:48:38,451
#  Y'all gonna make me... # 

984
00:48:38,528 --> 00:48:40,120
- TLC.
- There you go.

985
00:48:40,196 --> 00:48:41,891
Fishin' pole on 'em.

986
00:48:41,964 --> 00:48:44,023
- Aah.
- Uh-oh, pop lock.

987
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:45,499
OK, can you bring me some?
Bring some. Bring some.

988
00:48:45,568 --> 00:48:47,160
All right.

989
00:48:47,236 --> 00:48:49,227
- Whoa.
- Uh-oh. Pass it back.

990
00:48:49,305 --> 00:48:51,296
Pass it back. Oh!

991
00:48:51,374 --> 00:48:54,002
- #  Won't you # 
- Oh!

992
00:48:54,076 --> 00:48:56,306
# Meet me outside with my rough riders #

993
00:48:56,379 --> 00:48:58,370
# Meet me outside, meet me outside #

994
00:48:58,447 --> 00:49:01,211
# Meet me outside #

995
00:49:01,284 --> 00:49:03,081
# Meet me outside, meet me outside #

996
00:49:03,152 --> 00:49:04,847
- Tracy.
- # Meet me outside #

997
00:49:04,921 --> 00:49:06,513
# Meet me #
What's goin' on?

998
00:49:06,589 --> 00:49:08,557
How come you
told me that your dad was dead?

999
00:49:08,624 --> 00:49:10,319
And he really isn't?

1000
00:49:10,393 --> 00:49:11,417
- Calvin, look, look, no.
- Why?

1001
00:49:11,494 --> 00:49:13,257
I don't wanna talk about
this right now, OK?

1002
00:49:13,329 --> 00:49:14,523
But I don't understand, Tracy.

1003
00:49:14,597 --> 00:49:18,363
I would do anything...
anything... to have a father.

1004
00:49:20,136 --> 00:49:21,228
Don't worry about it.

1005
00:49:27,910 --> 00:49:29,878
Wait right here.

1006
00:49:34,116 --> 00:49:36,584
Ah. Excuse me.

1007
00:49:36,652 --> 00:49:37,584
I'm here to pick up my order.

1008
00:49:37,653 --> 00:49:39,211
I can help you with that.

1009
00:49:42,525 --> 00:49:43,856
What's the name?

1010
00:49:43,926 --> 00:49:46,724
Reynolds.
Tracy Reynolds.

1011
00:49:46,796 --> 00:49:48,388
I thought I recognized you.

1012
00:49:48,464 --> 00:49:50,295
- Right.
- I seen your ads.

1013
00:49:50,366 --> 00:49:52,630
You're that, um,
accountant, right?

1014
00:50:04,550 --> 00:50:06,177
You comfortable?

1015
00:50:06,252 --> 00:50:07,651
Very much so, yes.

1016
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:09,779
So you know my name.

1017
00:50:09,855 --> 00:50:11,652
Um, do you have a name for me?

1018
00:50:11,724 --> 00:50:13,385
Allegra.

1019
00:50:13,459 --> 00:50:15,086
Allegra?
That's a very pretty name.

1020
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:16,787
Allegra.
Is that French? Spanish?

1021
00:50:16,862 --> 00:50:18,295
It's your allergy medicine.

1022
00:50:18,364 --> 00:50:21,856
See, I knew that. I knew that
'cause my parents was from France.

1023
00:50:27,072 --> 00:50:28,061
Come on.

1024
00:50:28,207 --> 00:50:30,675
Now these are your sleeping pills.
Red cap.

1025
00:50:30,743 --> 00:50:32,074
- OK, OK.
- They're very strong.

1026
00:50:32,144 --> 00:50:33,133
So take one right before bed.

1027
00:50:33,212 --> 00:50:34,144
Got it.

1028
00:50:34,213 --> 00:50:37,307
This is your allergy medicine.
Blue cap. Take one twice a day.

1029
00:50:37,383 --> 00:50:38,315
OK.

1030
00:50:38,384 --> 00:50:39,316
2 once a day. I got it.

1031
00:50:41,153 --> 00:50:43,212
Thanks for your help.

1032
00:50:43,289 --> 00:50:45,154
Oh, and Tracy...

1033
00:50:45,224 --> 00:50:46,919
that crossover move
you do to your left,

1034
00:50:46,992 --> 00:50:48,391
you're telegraphing it.

1035
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:49,950
Oh. See, I knew.

1036
00:50:50,029 --> 00:50:53,055
I knew you knew
about Tracy Reynolds.

1037
00:50:53,132 --> 00:50:55,498
I knew you... I knew.
See, I knew you would...

1038
00:50:55,567 --> 00:50:57,330
Yeah. Well, bye.

1039
00:50:57,403 --> 00:50:59,837
What-What took you so long?

1040
00:50:59,905 --> 00:51:01,896
It's almost curfew.

1041
00:51:01,974 --> 00:51:03,635
Don't worry.

1042
00:51:03,709 --> 00:51:05,506
We'll be back at the hotel in a minute.

1043
00:51:05,577 --> 00:51:06,771
You all right?

1044
00:51:06,845 --> 00:51:07,777
Yeah.

1045
00:51:17,523 --> 00:51:19,582
It's like butter, baby.
What? What?

1046
00:51:19,658 --> 00:51:21,091
Are you all right, man?

1047
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:22,184
Uh, yeah. I'm good.
You sure?

1048
00:51:22,261 --> 00:51:25,753
Mm-hmm.
Mmm. I'm good.

1049
00:51:25,831 --> 00:51:27,059
I worry about you sometimes, Tracy.

1050
00:51:27,132 --> 00:51:28,690
Tracy.

1051
00:51:28,767 --> 00:51:30,394
What? What's up?
What's up? What?

1052
00:51:33,939 --> 00:51:37,466
I don't want you doin'nothin'crazy
like fallin'asleep on me.! Man, wake up.!

1053
00:51:37,543 --> 00:51:39,511
OK, OK, all right.
Put the pool in back,

1054
00:51:39,578 --> 00:51:41,478
put the diving board
in the shallow end.

1055
00:51:41,547 --> 00:51:43,572
And I'm all good.
This is all so...

1056
00:51:43,649 --> 00:51:45,617
Tray!

1057
00:51:45,684 --> 00:51:47,447
Tracy!

1058
00:51:47,519 --> 00:51:49,453
Tracy!

1059
00:51:51,090 --> 00:51:52,022
Man.

1060
00:52:07,139 --> 00:52:10,734
I can't see squat.
Dang!

1061
00:52:17,316 --> 00:52:20,285
Hmm? Allegra.

1062
00:52:20,352 --> 00:52:21,284
Huh?

1063
00:52:36,602 --> 00:52:39,127
Tracy...

1064
00:52:39,204 --> 00:52:41,104
you better hold on
for this one.

1065
00:53:02,227 --> 00:53:03,159
Dang.

1066
00:53:16,542 --> 00:53:18,669
Bellhop.

1067
00:53:20,145 --> 00:53:22,978
Hey, Trace. Trace.
Check it out.

1068
00:53:23,048 --> 00:53:27,109
Calvin got benched
for goin' out joyridin' last night.

1069
00:53:27,186 --> 00:53:28,778
What'd he do somethin'
like that for?

1070
00:53:28,854 --> 00:53:30,481
I don't know.

1071
00:53:30,556 --> 00:53:32,319
He did it to keep you
from getting suspended.

1072
00:53:32,391 --> 00:53:33,380
What?

1073
00:53:33,459 --> 00:53:35,450
How do you think
you got back last night?

1074
00:53:52,845 --> 00:53:58,078
Listen, um,
I'm sorry you got suspended.

1075
00:53:58,150 --> 00:54:01,483
And this is really hard
for me to say, but...

1076
00:54:01,553 --> 00:54:03,612
I appreciate what you did for me.

1077
00:54:03,689 --> 00:54:07,716
You had my back... C-dog.

1078
00:54:12,331 --> 00:54:14,424
You're welcome, T-time.

1079
00:54:17,336 --> 00:54:20,169
All right. Now listen,
the team really needs you to win

1080
00:54:20,239 --> 00:54:22,503
so why don't you
get some sleep, all right?

1081
00:54:29,882 --> 00:54:31,713
You really that afraid of the dark?

1082
00:54:31,783 --> 00:54:34,718
Yeah.

1083
00:54:34,786 --> 00:54:37,653
Hmm.
Listen, don't worry about it.

1084
00:54:37,723 --> 00:54:39,657
'Cause, you know,
we all have our fears.

1085
00:54:39,725 --> 00:54:43,422
Like me and this
whole flying thing, man.

1086
00:54:43,495 --> 00:54:44,655
- Yeah.
- It scares me.

1087
00:54:44,730 --> 00:54:48,131
Well, see, my thing is,
you're getting on the plane.

1088
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:49,428
Mm-hmm.

1089
00:54:49,501 --> 00:54:50,798
That's brave.

1090
00:54:52,604 --> 00:54:54,595
Hmm.

1091
00:54:54,673 --> 00:54:56,004
Right.

1092
00:54:56,074 --> 00:54:59,441
OK, OK. So since I'm brave
in gettin' on this plane,

1093
00:54:59,511 --> 00:55:01,604
why don't you be brave...

1094
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:04,774
and turn off the light?

1095
00:55:10,255 --> 00:55:12,086
I don't know.

1096
00:55:12,157 --> 00:55:13,089
Hmm.

1097
00:55:27,539 --> 00:55:30,838
Are you prepared for
that big test tomorrow?

1098
00:55:30,909 --> 00:55:32,706
Yes, Sister Theresa.

1099
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:37,671
Reg, you have to help me, please.

1100
00:55:37,749 --> 00:55:39,876
I'm not helping you
with your geometry.

1101
00:55:39,952 --> 00:55:40,941
Why?

1102
00:55:41,019 --> 00:55:43,249
Because I don't understand it
any more than you do.

1103
00:55:43,322 --> 00:55:45,483
Welcome, everybody,
and follow me into the room.

1104
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:50,223
Who are all those people?

1105
00:55:50,295 --> 00:55:52,627
Parents, here to see you.

1106
00:55:52,698 --> 00:55:54,791
What's wrong, Murph?
I mean, that's a good thing, right?

1107
00:55:54,866 --> 00:55:56,265
Good for you.

1108
00:55:56,335 --> 00:55:57,962
It doesn't do us any good.

1109
00:56:01,406 --> 00:56:02,464
Murph.

1110
00:56:02,541 --> 00:56:06,068
Congratulations.
Go get adopted.

1111
00:56:06,144 --> 00:56:08,339
What's wrong with him?

1112
00:56:08,413 --> 00:56:09,345
What do you think?

1113
00:56:09,414 --> 00:56:10,540
I don't know.

1114
00:56:10,616 --> 00:56:12,743
Bittleman told me
that I couldn't get adopted.

1115
00:56:12,818 --> 00:56:14,615
And you believe Bittleman?

1116
00:56:16,388 --> 00:56:18,720
Coach Wagner On Phone: His contract
says nothing about adoption.

1117
00:56:18,790 --> 00:56:21,224
Look, why would you send
all of these people here?

1118
00:56:21,293 --> 00:56:22,521
Calvin deserves a home.

1119
00:56:22,594 --> 00:56:24,528
You're only interested
in making money off him.

1120
00:56:24,596 --> 00:56:27,190
Look, with all due respect,
Coach Wagner,

1121
00:56:27,266 --> 00:56:29,598
child custody law is very complex.

1122
00:56:29,668 --> 00:56:31,226
Mr. Bittleman.

1123
00:56:31,303 --> 00:56:33,771
Coach Wagner:Just because you
signed his contract as his guardian...

1124
00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:35,898
I'll call you back.
I'll call you back.

1125
00:56:35,974 --> 00:56:37,339
Coach Wagner:
Wait! I'm not through talkin'...

1126
00:56:37,409 --> 00:56:38,706
Yes, what is it, Calvin?

1127
00:56:38,777 --> 00:56:40,108
You lied to me.

1128
00:56:40,178 --> 00:56:41,372
What are you talking about?

1129
00:56:41,446 --> 00:56:43,073
You told me
no one can adopt me.

1130
00:56:43,148 --> 00:56:45,048
I never said that.

1131
00:56:54,826 --> 00:56:57,260
Look, Calvin,

1132
00:56:57,329 --> 00:57:01,766
bear in mind I have cared for you

1133
00:57:01,833 --> 00:57:05,064
way before
you were rich or famous,

1134
00:57:05,137 --> 00:57:06,832
and all of those people in there,

1135
00:57:06,905 --> 00:57:08,566
the only reason
that they're interested in you

1136
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:10,058
is because you're famous.

1137
00:57:10,192 --> 00:57:11,887
I'd like to see for myself.

1138
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:15,452
Well, that's fiine.

1139
00:57:15,530 --> 00:57:18,988
I will, um...

1140
00:57:19,067 --> 00:57:22,161
make arrangements
with the very best candidates.

1141
00:57:22,237 --> 00:57:24,412
What do you think about that,
my big man?

1142
00:57:24,545 --> 00:57:26,137
We've been doing musical dinner theater
now over 6 years.

1143
00:57:26,214 --> 00:57:27,476
...In over 27 cities.
... Mm-hmm.

1144
00:57:30,604 --> 00:57:35,234
No more hard-knock life
for you, Calvin.

1145
00:57:35,309 --> 00:57:40,110
#The sun'll come out tomorrow #

1146
00:57:40,181 --> 00:57:44,675
# Bet your bottom dollar
that tomorrow #

1147
00:57:44,752 --> 00:57:47,084
#They'll be sun #

1148
00:57:47,154 --> 00:57:49,247
We run a tight ship, Cambridge!

1149
00:57:49,323 --> 00:57:50,813
Roll call 0600!

1150
00:57:50,891 --> 00:57:51,823
I think you're gonna flip

1151
00:57:51,892 --> 00:57:54,554
for my sugar-free
seaweed rice cream.

1152
00:57:54,628 --> 00:57:56,789
# I just stick out my chin #

1153
00:57:56,864 --> 00:57:57,990
#And grin #

1154
00:57:58,065 --> 00:57:59,157
All right, good buddy.

1155
00:57:59,233 --> 00:58:00,791
Now Denise here
will home school you

1156
00:58:00,868 --> 00:58:02,733
'cause we're on the road 24-7.

1157
00:58:02,803 --> 00:58:04,065
#And I say #

1158
00:58:04,138 --> 00:58:07,039
Ya, Ras Clap, ya have to
come back with me, ya seein'?

1159
00:58:07,107 --> 00:58:09,507
#Tomorrow, tomorrow #

1160
00:58:09,577 --> 00:58:11,374
How tall are you, boy?!
How tall are you?!

1161
00:58:11,445 --> 00:58:13,003
You'll learn to hold your bladder.

1162
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:15,105
#We love ya tomorrow #

1163
00:58:15,182 --> 00:58:18,515
#  You're only a day # 

1164
00:58:18,586 --> 00:58:21,987
#Away #

1165
00:58:24,525 --> 00:58:26,254
You see, Calvin?

1166
00:58:26,327 --> 00:58:29,262
You're best off here...

1167
00:58:29,330 --> 00:58:30,661
with me.

1168
00:58:38,906 --> 00:58:39,838
Hey, yo, Trace.

1169
00:58:39,907 --> 00:58:40,839
Tracy: Hello?

1170
00:58:40,908 --> 00:58:42,307
It's me, Calvin.

1171
00:58:42,376 --> 00:58:43,502
Calvin. Wait. You're here?

1172
00:58:43,577 --> 00:58:44,976
Yeah, I'm here,

1173
00:58:45,045 --> 00:58:46,979
and it took me 4 busses
to get here, too.

1174
00:58:47,047 --> 00:58:48,173
Uh, all right.

1175
00:59:02,663 --> 00:59:05,393
Dang.
Man, this is where you live?

1176
00:59:05,466 --> 00:59:06,694
Calvin, what are you doing here?

1177
00:59:06,767 --> 00:59:08,632
Hey, I just can't wait
to see the inside.

1178
00:59:08,702 --> 00:59:09,896
Calvin.

1179
00:59:09,970 --> 00:59:11,631
Calvin, wait. Calvin.

1180
00:59:11,705 --> 00:59:14,105
Come on, Calvin.
Tell me why you're here.

1181
00:59:14,174 --> 00:59:17,007
Aw, this is tight.

1182
00:59:17,077 --> 00:59:18,601
Look at all the stuff you got, man.

1183
00:59:18,679 --> 00:59:20,704
Yeah. Yeah, it's tight.

1184
00:59:20,781 --> 00:59:22,612
So come on, man, tell me what's up.
Why you here?

1185
00:59:22,683 --> 00:59:25,777
I wanna check your place out.

1186
00:59:25,853 --> 00:59:30,187
You know,just look at your crib
and everything.

1187
00:59:30,257 --> 00:59:32,282
What do you call this game?

1188
00:59:32,359 --> 00:59:34,827
I have no idea.
It came with the house.

1189
00:59:34,895 --> 00:59:36,226
Oh, man.

1190
00:59:36,297 --> 00:59:37,958
So you're not gonna tell me
why you're here?

1191
00:59:38,032 --> 00:59:40,694
We need one of these
at the orphanage.

1192
00:59:40,768 --> 00:59:43,828
OK, OK. So I take it
you don't wanna tell me

1193
00:59:43,904 --> 00:59:45,462
what's goin' on with you.
I understand.

1194
00:59:45,539 --> 00:59:46,471
It's your prerogative.
That's cool.

1195
00:59:46,540 --> 00:59:48,633
No, I mean, nothin's goin' on.

1196
00:59:48,709 --> 00:59:49,641
I mean, everything's all right.

1197
00:59:49,710 --> 00:59:50,768
Everything's goin' real well.

1198
00:59:50,844 --> 00:59:51,776
Everything's perfect.

1199
00:59:51,845 --> 00:59:53,472
Uh, everything's, uh,

1200
00:59:53,547 --> 00:59:54,707
you know, uh...

1201
00:59:57,518 --> 00:59:58,815
All right, man.

1202
00:59:58,886 --> 01:00:01,582
Everything's goin' real
terrible right about now.

1203
01:00:01,655 --> 01:00:03,316
My best friend Murph,
he's mad at me.

1204
01:00:03,390 --> 01:00:04,550
Bittleman lied to me.

1205
01:00:04,625 --> 01:00:07,355
He set up the worst parents
in orphan history

1206
01:00:07,428 --> 01:00:09,157
to come meet with me.

1207
01:00:09,229 --> 01:00:10,560
And then, on top of that,

1208
01:00:10,631 --> 01:00:13,794
I have a geometry test tomorrow,
and I hate geometry.

1209
01:00:13,867 --> 01:00:15,767
Mmm.
All right, well, listen,

1210
01:00:15,836 --> 01:00:18,134
I'm sure the right parents
are gonna show up for you, OK?

1211
01:00:18,205 --> 01:00:20,605
It's just a question of time,
so you gotta have a little faith.

1212
01:00:20,674 --> 01:00:22,642
All right?
But in the meantime...

1213
01:00:26,447 --> 01:00:27,539
call your boy Murph.

1214
01:00:27,614 --> 01:00:29,707
- Right now?
- Right now, yes.

1215
01:00:29,783 --> 01:00:30,772
Good friends are hard to come by,

1216
01:00:30,851 --> 01:00:32,375
so you gotta keep things
straight with 'em.

1217
01:00:32,453 --> 01:00:34,318
You have your geometry work with you?

1218
01:00:34,388 --> 01:00:35,753
Yeah.

1219
01:00:35,823 --> 01:00:38,223
You know a little somethin'
about geometry?

1220
01:00:38,292 --> 01:00:40,260
Do I know about geometry?

1221
01:00:40,327 --> 01:00:42,887
Ha ha ha!
Do I know about geometry?

1222
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:48,261
Take-Take your time on that call,

1223
01:00:48,335 --> 01:00:50,064
and, um, meet me outside.

1224
01:00:50,137 --> 01:00:54,005
I gotta...
I know geometry, but let me...

1225
01:01:00,414 --> 01:01:02,314
OK, now, the key
to the whole geometry thing

1226
01:01:02,383 --> 01:01:05,318
and gettin' the hang of these triangles
is to super-size them.

1227
01:01:05,386 --> 01:01:07,081
- Super-size?
- Super-size.

1228
01:01:07,154 --> 01:01:08,212
You painted your house.

1229
01:01:08,288 --> 01:01:10,694
All right, look. Tell me
what triangle this is right here.

1230
01:01:10,771 --> 01:01:12,295
Um...

1231
01:01:12,372 --> 01:01:14,806
I'm not familiar with this one.
I don't know.

1232
01:01:14,875 --> 01:01:15,807
All right.
Let me give you a hint.

1233
01:01:15,876 --> 01:01:16,808
So you got MJ over there

1234
01:01:16,877 --> 01:01:17,809
posting up
a small point guard, right?

1235
01:01:17,878 --> 01:01:19,277
You got Rodman over there

1236
01:01:19,346 --> 01:01:20,313
on the other side of the court
with his hair.

1237
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:21,870
Now Pippin comes
to screen for Michael.

1238
01:01:21,948 --> 01:01:23,210
So what do you got?

1239
01:01:23,283 --> 01:01:25,342
Well, this is the Bulls'
triangle offense, right?

1240
01:01:25,419 --> 01:01:26,477
Right.

1241
01:01:26,553 --> 01:01:28,612
We're just givin' room
for Michael to isolate.

1242
01:01:28,689 --> 01:01:32,181
Isolate. Isosceles.
An isosceles triangle.

1243
01:01:32,259 --> 01:01:33,191
Exactly.

1244
01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:35,353
The Lakers use this triangle offense.

1245
01:01:35,429 --> 01:01:38,523
This triangle has equal sides
for Kobe and Shaq.

1246
01:01:38,598 --> 01:01:42,364
Equal sides. OK.
This is an equilateral triangle.

1247
01:01:42,436 --> 01:01:43,460
There you go.
See, you're gettin' it.

1248
01:01:43,537 --> 01:01:45,232
You're gettin' it.
OK. OK.

1249
01:01:45,305 --> 01:01:46,397
Uh, I got this.

1250
01:01:46,473 --> 01:01:47,735
You got this one?

1251
01:01:47,808 --> 01:01:48,900
- OK, now this is us.
- Uh-huh.

1252
01:01:48,975 --> 01:01:50,840
And you know the type
of triangle offense we use

1253
01:01:50,911 --> 01:01:53,038
is the acute offense...
well, the acute triangle offense.

1254
01:01:53,113 --> 01:01:54,444
- OK.
- That's because

1255
01:01:54,514 --> 01:01:56,414
Calvin Cambridge is so damn cute.

1256
01:01:56,483 --> 01:01:57,882
Oh, man, give me a break.
I'm the cute one.

1257
01:01:57,951 --> 01:01:58,883
- No, I am.
- No, see.

1258
01:01:58,952 --> 01:01:59,884
Look at the picture.
I'm the cute one.

1259
01:01:59,953 --> 01:02:01,682
- No.
- OK, go ahead. Fine.

1260
01:02:01,755 --> 01:02:03,723
All right. So...

1261
01:02:03,790 --> 01:02:06,554
OK, see, here's Joad, right?

1262
01:02:06,626 --> 01:02:07,752
- Right.
- This is Joad.

1263
01:02:07,828 --> 01:02:09,261
Joad's gonna take the ball out.

1264
01:02:09,329 --> 01:02:11,820
He's gonna pass all the way to you.

1265
01:02:11,898 --> 01:02:13,559
- OK.
- You're right here.

1266
01:02:13,633 --> 01:02:14,531
- Right.
- See me?

1267
01:02:14,601 --> 01:02:15,966
I'm gonna be headin' down court

1268
01:02:16,036 --> 01:02:19,563
for the full-court lob pass
just like this, right?

1269
01:02:19,639 --> 01:02:21,231
Oh, hey, Calvin. Calvin.

1270
01:02:21,308 --> 01:02:22,332
Don't put paint on
my windows, all right?

1271
01:02:22,409 --> 01:02:23,569
But I'm gonna be wide open.

1272
01:02:23,643 --> 01:02:24,610
You gotta pass me the ball.

1273
01:02:24,678 --> 01:02:26,373
I'm warning you, all right?
Don't do it.

1274
01:02:26,446 --> 01:02:28,710
And then...

1275
01:02:28,782 --> 01:02:31,615
Wham!
2 points for me

1276
01:02:31,685 --> 01:02:34,279
and the assist...

1277
01:02:34,354 --> 01:02:35,286
to Reynolds.

1278
01:02:35,355 --> 01:02:37,220
Oh, OK.
So you think you're cute

1279
01:02:37,290 --> 01:02:39,087
puttin' the paint and then
messin' up the house, huh?

1280
01:02:39,159 --> 01:02:40,421
Well, let me see what we've got.

1281
01:02:40,494 --> 01:02:41,859
Let's say if I went and did...

1282
01:02:41,928 --> 01:02:44,590
Oh! Aw. Hey!

1283
01:02:44,664 --> 01:02:46,461
Orange looks nice on you, man.

1284
01:02:46,533 --> 01:02:47,795
That's not funny.

1285
01:02:47,868 --> 01:02:49,392
No, it really is funny
'cause it looks nice.

1286
01:02:49,469 --> 01:02:50,401
It goes nice with the blue and...

1287
01:02:50,470 --> 01:02:51,494
Oh, really?

1288
01:02:51,571 --> 01:02:53,596
Yeah. You kinda look
like a rainbow or...

1289
01:02:53,673 --> 01:02:55,573
Well, the orange looks really nice...

1290
01:02:55,642 --> 01:02:56,574
Calvin, I know you're not gonna do that.

1291
01:02:56,643 --> 01:02:58,907
- Oh!
- On you!

1292
01:02:58,979 --> 01:02:59,911
You really think it's funny?

1293
01:02:59,980 --> 01:03:02,073
No, no, no, no, no!

1294
01:03:02,149 --> 01:03:03,275
What are you doin'?
Cal. Calvin.

1295
01:03:03,350 --> 01:03:04,749
Calvin. Whoa!

1296
01:03:04,818 --> 01:03:06,308
Aah!

1297
01:03:13,527 --> 01:03:14,494
You must be Tracy.

1298
01:03:14,561 --> 01:03:15,823
You must be Murph.

1299
01:03:15,896 --> 01:03:17,295
Yeah, that's me.

1300
01:03:17,364 --> 01:03:18,331
What's up, Murph?

1301
01:03:18,398 --> 01:03:19,660
Hey, Cal.
You all right?

1302
01:03:19,733 --> 01:03:20,665
Yeah, I'm pretty good.

1303
01:03:20,734 --> 01:03:23,828
But can you believe
the cab ride here cost 50 bucks?

1304
01:03:23,904 --> 01:03:25,235
You should have took the bus.

1305
01:03:25,305 --> 01:03:27,637
Tracy, can you lend me 49.50?

1306
01:03:27,707 --> 01:03:29,197
Heh. All right, Murph.

1307
01:03:29,276 --> 01:03:31,005
I'll go get my wallet.

1308
01:03:31,077 --> 01:03:33,602
So what have you guys been up to?

1309
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:35,341
Geometry.

1310
01:03:35,415 --> 01:03:37,007
Think you could teach me?

1311
01:03:37,083 --> 01:03:39,574
# All I'm tryin'to do
is get my dough on # 

1312
01:03:39,653 --> 01:03:41,314
# I'm your boy,you're my girlfriend # 

1313
01:03:41,388 --> 01:03:42,821
# Stop, hold up # 

1314
01:03:42,889 --> 01:03:45,949
# I ain't in no kind of rush to grow up,
so slow up # 

1315
01:03:46,026 --> 01:03:47,584
# I'm just playin'the game # 

1316
01:03:47,661 --> 01:03:48,650
# Let me warn you, girl # 

1317
01:03:48,728 --> 01:03:50,195
# Before you get rough with me # 

1318
01:03:50,263 --> 01:03:52,891
#  You might think you got me,
but you never really get me # 

1319
01:03:52,966 --> 01:03:55,935
# So don't trip
if you see me doin'my thing # 

1320
01:03:56,002 --> 01:03:57,094
# I told ya # 

1321
01:03:57,170 --> 01:03:57,966
# I'm just playin'the game # 

1322
01:03:58,038 --> 01:03:59,198
#  Yeah # 

1323
01:03:59,272 --> 01:04:00,899
# Playin'the game # 

1324
01:04:02,909 --> 01:04:05,878
- Aah!
- Whoa!

1325
01:04:05,946 --> 01:04:07,607
Cannonball!

1326
01:04:12,652 --> 01:04:14,483
When Calvin Cambridge
comes to your town,

1327
01:04:14,554 --> 01:04:15,782
you'd better watch out.

1328
01:04:15,856 --> 01:04:18,347
Well, that was the fiinal word
from Gary "the Glove" Payton tonight

1329
01:04:18,425 --> 01:04:20,290
after the Seattle Sonics battled it out

1330
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:22,328
with Cambridge
and the Los Angeles Knights.

1331
01:04:24,030 --> 01:04:25,895
Yeah, now you know
what it feels like to be in the glove.

1332
01:04:25,966 --> 01:04:27,661
It's more like a mitten, Gary.

1333
01:04:27,734 --> 01:04:29,668
Kenny Mayne: The Knights rallied
around Cambridge after that,

1334
01:04:29,736 --> 01:04:32,364
and before it was all over,
Payton got the gate.

1335
01:04:32,439 --> 01:04:33,531
Get him outta here, Ref.

1336
01:04:33,607 --> 01:04:34,574
Rich Eisen:
And Kenny, how about the way

1337
01:04:34,641 --> 01:04:36,199
Reynolds jumped in
to protect Cambridge?

1338
01:04:36,276 --> 01:04:37,243
How about that?

1339
01:04:37,310 --> 01:04:38,208
They're startin' to come together, Rich.

1340
01:04:38,278 --> 01:04:39,643
The team's gelling at this point,

1341
01:04:39,713 --> 01:04:41,613
and with 3 games left in the season,

1342
01:04:41,681 --> 01:04:42,875
they are only 2 wins away

1343
01:04:42,949 --> 01:04:45,042
from their fiirst ever trip
to the play-offs.

1344
01:04:45,118 --> 01:04:46,050
#  Take it to the top # 

1345
01:04:46,119 --> 01:04:50,053
#  Get your head in the game # 

1346
01:04:50,123 --> 01:04:52,921
#  Get up out your seats
or you got no one to blame # 

1347
01:04:52,993 --> 01:04:54,585
# Rise up, giddyup # 

1348
01:04:54,661 --> 01:04:56,424
#  The Knights is flyin'higher # 

1349
01:04:58,498 --> 01:04:59,988
The Knights win!

1350
01:05:00,066 --> 01:05:02,500
Yes! Ha ha ha!

1351
01:05:04,571 --> 01:05:05,970
Whoo!

1352
01:05:06,039 --> 01:05:07,631
- Oof.
- Aah!

1353
01:05:07,707 --> 01:05:09,538
Coach, great game.
Great game.

1354
01:05:09,609 --> 01:05:11,600
Fellas, unbelievable.
Hey, guys,

1355
01:05:11,678 --> 01:05:14,738
I gotta pinch myself.
One more win

1356
01:05:14,814 --> 01:05:16,145
and we're in the play-offs,

1357
01:05:16,216 --> 01:05:17,478
and you know what that means

1358
01:05:17,550 --> 01:05:20,246
for every man in this organization?

1359
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:22,880
Bonuses. Ha ha.
Contract renewals.

1360
01:05:22,956 --> 01:05:25,220
We'll all have jobs next year.

1361
01:05:25,292 --> 01:05:27,260
You two together...

1362
01:05:29,062 --> 01:05:29,994
this works.

1363
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,331
Come on. Let's go.

1364
01:05:36,836 --> 01:05:41,603
So you still haven't met
any parents you liked?

1365
01:05:41,675 --> 01:05:43,540
I don't know.

1366
01:05:43,610 --> 01:05:45,009
Nobody seems right.

1367
01:05:45,078 --> 01:05:46,443
Murph:
Maybe nobody seems right

1368
01:05:46,513 --> 01:05:48,572
because you already met
the right person.

1369
01:05:48,648 --> 01:05:50,081
What right person?

1370
01:05:50,150 --> 01:05:51,378
Tracy.

1371
01:05:51,451 --> 01:05:54,181
Tracy.

1372
01:05:54,254 --> 01:05:55,243
Listen, Murph,

1373
01:05:55,322 --> 01:05:57,153
Tracy can't even take care of himself.

1374
01:05:58,625 --> 01:05:59,751
You like him.

1375
01:05:59,826 --> 01:06:02,124
Yeah, so?

1376
01:06:02,195 --> 01:06:03,924
That doesn't mean he wants to adopt me.

1377
01:06:03,997 --> 01:06:05,521
Well, why don't you ask him?

1378
01:06:05,598 --> 01:06:08,123
Listen, Reg, Murph...

1379
01:06:08,201 --> 01:06:10,328
Tracy's not big on families.

1380
01:06:10,403 --> 01:06:12,803
He doesn't even talk to his own dad.

1381
01:06:12,872 --> 01:06:16,239
I mean, how can you have a dad

1382
01:06:16,309 --> 01:06:18,504
and not talk to him?

1383
01:06:18,578 --> 01:06:20,307
Man, that's nuts.

1384
01:06:20,380 --> 01:06:22,075
It ain't cool.

1385
01:06:22,148 --> 01:06:24,776
Can you do anything?

1386
01:06:27,887 --> 01:06:28,819
You're back again?

1387
01:06:28,888 --> 01:06:30,822
Yeah, uh, I got a surprise for you.

1388
01:06:30,890 --> 01:06:31,879
Somebody I want you to meet.

1389
01:06:31,958 --> 01:06:33,585
Oh, OK.
I hope she's wearin' a bikini.

1390
01:06:33,660 --> 01:06:36,527
Nah, it's not a woman.
It's-It's your number-one fan.

1391
01:06:36,596 --> 01:06:37,927
Well, it has to be a woman, right?

1392
01:06:41,801 --> 01:06:43,063
Calvin, why'd you bring him here?

1393
01:06:43,136 --> 01:06:44,068
This is your dad.

1394
01:06:44,137 --> 01:06:45,229
You don't want to talk to him?

1395
01:06:45,305 --> 01:06:46,294
Listen to me.

1396
01:06:46,373 --> 01:06:48,898
Now stay out of my business
and get him out of here. Now.

1397
01:06:56,716 --> 01:06:59,412
How could we lose to the Bulls?!

1398
01:06:59,486 --> 01:07:02,353
We were out of synch,
especially Cambridge and Reynolds.

1399
01:07:02,422 --> 01:07:03,787
What's the matter with you two?

1400
01:07:03,857 --> 01:07:05,324
This was your gimme.

1401
01:07:05,392 --> 01:07:08,486
Now you have to beat the Raptors
or we're out,you got that?

1402
01:07:08,561 --> 01:07:10,961
We're gonna have to tighten it up, guys.

1403
01:07:11,031 --> 01:07:12,328
Pull this thing together.

1404
01:07:12,399 --> 01:07:14,196
Damn it!

1405
01:07:16,102 --> 01:07:17,034
All right, listen, Cal...

1406
01:07:44,264 --> 01:07:45,993
What's wrong?

1407
01:07:47,233 --> 01:07:50,134
I give up on ever fiinding
somebody to adopt me.

1408
01:07:50,203 --> 01:07:52,535
Well, I wouldn't do that just yet.

1409
01:07:54,340 --> 01:07:56,900
Well, hello, Calvin.

1410
01:07:56,976 --> 01:07:58,534
We've been waiting for you.

1411
01:07:58,611 --> 01:08:00,272
We're the Boyds.

1412
01:08:00,346 --> 01:08:01,836
We're from Bel Air.

1413
01:08:09,589 --> 01:08:10,988
Hoo-ooh.

1414
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:15,354
Hmm?

1415
01:08:15,428 --> 01:08:16,918
What's the matter?

1416
01:08:16,996 --> 01:08:18,964
You've had something
on your mind all night.

1417
01:08:19,032 --> 01:08:20,294
Nah. No, I haven't.

1418
01:08:20,366 --> 01:08:22,357
It's Calvin, isn't it?

1419
01:08:26,339 --> 01:08:28,000
As we hit the end
of the regular season,

1420
01:08:28,074 --> 01:08:30,008
the big story
is this weekend's showdown

1421
01:08:30,076 --> 01:08:32,909
between the Los Angeles Knights
and the Toronto Raptors.

1422
01:08:32,979 --> 01:08:35,209
Both teams need a victory
to make the play-offs.

1423
01:08:35,281 --> 01:08:36,407
Man, this is personal.

1424
01:08:36,483 --> 01:08:40,180
It's play-off time, and my job
is to shut Calvin Cambridge down.

1425
01:08:40,253 --> 01:08:42,949
Besides, what does a little kid
know about the play-offs?

1426
01:08:43,022 --> 01:08:45,547
For the Knights to have
any shot at winning this game,

1427
01:08:45,625 --> 01:08:47,923
Reynolds and Cambridge
better get back in synch,

1428
01:08:47,994 --> 01:08:51,395
and Cambridge better
bring every weapon in his arsenal.

1429
01:08:54,934 --> 01:08:56,731
Ha. Hey, man.
How you doing?

1430
01:08:56,803 --> 01:08:57,963
Fine.

1431
01:08:58,037 --> 01:08:59,299
Cool, cool, cool.

1432
01:08:59,372 --> 01:09:00,304
Hey, I wanted to ask you,

1433
01:09:00,373 --> 01:09:03,934
uh, is it true what you said
about Calvin's, uh, sneakers?

1434
01:09:04,010 --> 01:09:05,841
I guess.

1435
01:09:05,912 --> 01:09:07,038
"I guess?"
Don't "I guess" me, you idiot.

1436
01:09:09,082 --> 01:09:11,175
Is it because of the sneakers?

1437
01:09:11,251 --> 01:09:13,515
Huh? Huh?

1438
01:09:13,586 --> 01:09:15,349
Uh-huh? Yes?

1439
01:09:15,421 --> 01:09:16,445
Yeah.

1440
01:09:16,523 --> 01:09:18,354
Yeah, yeah. OK.

1441
01:09:18,424 --> 01:09:20,289
All right, hey, thanks.

1442
01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:22,954
Ha ha. Cool, cool.

1443
01:09:23,029 --> 01:09:24,496
Cool.

1444
01:09:26,566 --> 01:09:28,363
But I have to wear my sneakers.

1445
01:09:28,434 --> 01:09:30,197
Right, right.

1446
01:09:30,270 --> 01:09:31,498
But-But they're sneakers.

1447
01:09:31,571 --> 01:09:34,802
They're not... They're not proper attire
for brunch at the Boyds.

1448
01:09:34,874 --> 01:09:38,332
You just want to make
your best possible impression.

1449
01:09:38,411 --> 01:09:40,811
So put on these shoes, look good,

1450
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:43,246
and maybe you'll get adopted.

1451
01:09:45,385 --> 01:09:46,374
Go on.

1452
01:09:48,688 --> 01:09:50,087
All right, Murph.

1453
01:09:50,156 --> 01:09:52,954
Guard these with your life, all right?

1454
01:09:53,026 --> 01:09:54,391
I will.

1455
01:09:56,196 --> 01:09:57,754
Good luck with the Boyds.

1456
01:09:57,830 --> 01:09:58,888
I hope they're the right ones.

1457
01:09:58,965 --> 01:10:00,091
Yeah, me, too, man.

1458
01:10:00,166 --> 01:10:02,100
See you later, man, all right?

1459
01:10:25,364 --> 01:10:27,559
Make me like Mike.

1460
01:10:56,996 --> 01:10:59,794
I guess they don't fiit me, Mom, huh?

1461
01:10:59,866 --> 01:11:00,798
Where are they?

1462
01:11:00,867 --> 01:11:01,959
Where are what?

1463
01:11:02,034 --> 01:11:03,092
The sneakers.

1464
01:11:03,169 --> 01:11:05,467
I don't know what you're talking about.

1465
01:11:05,538 --> 01:11:07,267
Bittleman:
I don't want to do this.

1466
01:11:07,340 --> 01:11:10,207
No! Not my mom's picture!

1467
01:11:10,276 --> 01:11:11,538
No.!

1468
01:11:11,611 --> 01:11:14,205
All right. I'm gonna
ask you one last time.

1469
01:11:15,948 --> 01:11:18,849
Where are Calvin's sneakers?

1470
01:11:20,219 --> 01:11:21,481
All right,
you're not gonna tell me?

1471
01:11:21,554 --> 01:11:23,021
OK, all right, here we go then.

1472
01:11:23,089 --> 01:11:24,056
I'm gonna light it.

1473
01:11:24,123 --> 01:11:25,454
Say good-bye to mom.!

1474
01:11:25,525 --> 01:11:26,787
Bye. There she goes.

1475
01:11:26,859 --> 01:11:29,384
- Bye, Mom.
- No.! No.! Stop it.!

1476
01:11:29,462 --> 01:11:31,362
Burning.
This is your fault.

1477
01:11:31,430 --> 01:11:32,362
It's your fault.

1478
01:11:32,431 --> 01:11:33,363
No! They're in the attic!

1479
01:11:33,432 --> 01:11:34,797
Attic! Attic... Ow!

1480
01:11:34,867 --> 01:11:37,131
Ah! Good! All right.

1481
01:11:37,203 --> 01:11:38,966
Good. In the attic.

1482
01:11:39,038 --> 01:11:40,630
Good, good. Good.

1483
01:11:40,706 --> 01:11:44,164
All right.
Now, you want to see this again?

1484
01:11:44,243 --> 01:11:46,677
Do not say anything to Calvin.

1485
01:12:02,662 --> 01:12:03,594
I'll get it!

1486
01:12:03,663 --> 01:12:04,595
I- It's all right.
It's all right.

1487
01:12:04,664 --> 01:12:05,596
I'm-I'm really sorry.

1488
01:12:05,665 --> 01:12:06,893
It's OK. I know. It's OK.

1489
01:12:12,405 --> 01:12:15,636
Excuse me, uh, Mr. Williams?

1490
01:12:15,708 --> 01:12:17,175
It's possible.

1491
01:12:17,243 --> 01:12:20,007
My dentist, Frank Nister,

1492
01:12:20,079 --> 01:12:21,876
said that I might be able
to fiind you here.

1493
01:12:21,948 --> 01:12:23,245
Who's Nister?

1494
01:12:23,316 --> 01:12:25,181
You know, the guy with the ear.

1495
01:12:26,352 --> 01:12:28,252
Um, my name is Stan Bittleman.

1496
01:12:28,321 --> 01:12:30,255
What can I do for you,
Mr. Bittleman?

1497
01:12:30,323 --> 01:12:33,884
I'm looking for a, uh,
sports broker,

1498
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:38,192
uh, to make
a sizable investment

1499
01:12:38,264 --> 01:12:41,028
in the Raptors
to beat the Knights.

1500
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:42,931
Why are you speaking in code?

1501
01:12:43,002 --> 01:12:45,027
You want to place a bet?
How much?

1502
01:12:45,104 --> 01:12:47,197
$100,000.

1503
01:12:49,842 --> 01:12:51,139
That's a lot of money.

1504
01:12:51,210 --> 01:12:52,768
You good for it?

1505
01:12:52,845 --> 01:12:54,938
Of course I am.

1506
01:12:55,014 --> 01:12:57,175
What makes you so confiident?

1507
01:12:58,551 --> 01:13:01,748
Well, let's just say
I have a good feeling

1508
01:13:01,821 --> 01:13:06,053
that Calvin Cambridge
is going to have...

1509
01:13:06,125 --> 01:13:09,060
an off game.

1510
01:13:10,062 --> 01:13:11,825
Tell me more.

1511
01:13:15,267 --> 01:13:16,359
We were gonna wait till later

1512
01:13:16,435 --> 01:13:19,427
to tell you this,
but, um, well, I can't wait.

1513
01:13:19,505 --> 01:13:23,464
Calvin, tomorrow
we're going to fiinalize your adoption,

1514
01:13:23,542 --> 01:13:27,569
and you will ofiicially become a Boyd.

1515
01:13:30,883 --> 01:13:32,475
A Boyd?

1516
01:13:47,433 --> 01:13:48,559
Yeah, a friend of mine told me

1517
01:13:48,634 --> 01:13:50,158
this would be a pretty good
place to come.

1518
01:13:51,704 --> 01:13:53,638
Any place would have been great.

1519
01:14:00,513 --> 01:14:02,606
Calvin?

1520
01:14:02,682 --> 01:14:04,513
I want to talk to you
about something, man.

1521
01:14:04,583 --> 01:14:07,484
Something, um...
something pretty big.

1522
01:14:07,553 --> 01:14:09,111
What?

1523
01:14:09,188 --> 01:14:11,520
Well...

1524
01:14:11,590 --> 01:14:14,457
I don't know.
I've been doing a lot of thinking.

1525
01:14:14,527 --> 01:14:16,051
Just thinking about
what's best for you

1526
01:14:16,128 --> 01:14:17,390
and-and for me.

1527
01:14:17,463 --> 01:14:18,395
Yeah?

1528
01:14:18,464 --> 01:14:20,125
Well, I...

1529
01:14:20,199 --> 01:14:21,791
Absolutely, coach.

1530
01:14:23,636 --> 01:14:26,730
Oh. Um, Tracy,

1531
01:14:26,806 --> 01:14:29,104
I would like you to meet the Boyds.

1532
01:14:29,175 --> 01:14:30,870
The Boyds are gonna be my...

1533
01:14:30,943 --> 01:14:32,376
My parents.

1534
01:14:34,346 --> 01:14:35,472
Mr. and Mrs. Boyd:Hi.

1535
01:14:35,548 --> 01:14:37,015
Mrs. Boyd:
Very nice to meet you.

1536
01:14:37,083 --> 01:14:39,483
It's... It's nice to meet you, too.

1537
01:14:39,552 --> 01:14:41,144
Um...

1538
01:14:41,220 --> 01:14:44,712
you guys are very, very lucky.

1539
01:14:44,790 --> 01:14:46,724
Don't we know it?

1540
01:14:52,765 --> 01:14:55,757
What-What was the big news
that you wanted to tell me?

1541
01:14:55,835 --> 01:14:57,962
Oh, oh, right. Right.

1542
01:14:58,037 --> 01:15:01,200
Um, you know
the pick-and-roll, right?

1543
01:15:01,273 --> 01:15:02,570
I'm gonna do the pick,

1544
01:15:02,641 --> 01:15:05,235
but I ain't...
I ain't gonna do the roll.

1545
01:15:05,311 --> 01:15:07,336
That-That was the big news?

1546
01:15:07,413 --> 01:15:08,607
Yeah.

1547
01:15:09,815 --> 01:15:10,747
It's nice to meet you guys.

1548
01:15:10,816 --> 01:15:12,215
Nice to meet you.
Same here.

1549
01:15:14,854 --> 01:15:16,549
Ooh! Dear, we better
claim our seats.

1550
01:15:16,622 --> 01:15:17,646
Oh, yes, yes.

1551
01:15:17,723 --> 01:15:19,122
Well, uh, we'll see you
after the game, son.

1552
01:15:19,191 --> 01:15:21,386
God, that sounds great.

1553
01:15:23,662 --> 01:15:24,594
Hello?

1554
01:15:24,663 --> 01:15:25,527
Here.

1555
01:15:28,100 --> 01:15:29,465
Yo, is anybody there?

1556
01:15:29,535 --> 01:15:31,400
Tell him.

1557
01:15:31,470 --> 01:15:34,564
I- It's Murph,
and I got something to tell you.

1558
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:35,572
I screwed up big time.

1559
01:15:35,641 --> 01:15:36,573
I didn't mean to tell him,
but then...

1560
01:15:36,642 --> 01:15:39,736
But then Bittleman was gonna burn
my mom's pictures. I had no choice.

1561
01:15:39,812 --> 01:15:42,747
Murph,just slow down, man.
Tell him what?

1562
01:15:42,815 --> 01:15:46,216
I told him about the sneakers,
and now they're in Bittleman's safe.

1563
01:15:46,285 --> 01:15:47,616
That-That's just crazy.

1564
01:15:47,686 --> 01:15:50,883
The sneakers are right here
in my gym... bag.

1565
01:15:50,956 --> 01:15:52,617
Oh, no!

1566
01:15:52,691 --> 01:15:53,623
What are you gonna do?

1567
01:15:53,692 --> 01:15:54,886
The game starts in 20 minutes!

1568
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:57,758
Wait. I have an idea.

1569
01:15:57,830 --> 01:15:59,730
I'll meet you ASAP.

1570
01:15:59,799 --> 01:16:01,232
ASAP. Got it.

1571
01:16:02,768 --> 01:16:04,099
Wait. What's ASAP?

1572
01:16:16,916 --> 01:16:19,316
All right!
Bring it in, gents, bring it in.

1573
01:16:19,385 --> 01:16:20,818
Let's go.

1574
01:16:20,886 --> 01:16:22,114
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1575
01:16:22,188 --> 01:16:23,177
Where's Cambridge?

1576
01:16:23,255 --> 01:16:24,722
What, man?
He's not here?

1577
01:16:24,790 --> 01:16:26,417
Check the bathrooms.

1578
01:16:39,004 --> 01:16:41,165
Oh, man! Dang!

1579
01:16:42,675 --> 01:16:44,700
Geoff:And the opening tip
goes to the Raptors.

1580
01:16:44,777 --> 01:16:46,870
With Calvin Cambridge nowhere in sight,

1581
01:16:46,946 --> 01:16:50,109
a lot of things may be going
the Raptors'way today.

1582
01:16:50,182 --> 01:16:53,640
OK, look, if you guys were gonna ask me
what I'm about to ask you, I'd run.

1583
01:16:53,719 --> 01:16:56,688
So if anybody wants to run,
I understand.

1584
01:16:56,755 --> 01:16:58,586
Geoff:
Here come the Raptors again.

1585
01:16:58,657 --> 01:17:00,648
They're making it look easy
on a breakaway.

1586
01:17:00,726 --> 01:17:02,626
Slam dunk by Vince Carter.

1587
01:17:02,695 --> 01:17:05,493
The Raptors are red hot in this one.

1588
01:17:07,499 --> 01:17:09,364
Toronto already leading by 9,

1589
01:17:09,435 --> 01:17:11,266
and here they come again.

1590
01:17:11,337 --> 01:17:13,328
The question the Knight fans are asking

1591
01:17:13,405 --> 01:17:16,636
is "where the heck is Calvin?"

1592
01:17:16,709 --> 01:17:19,041
Here come the Knights on offense,

1593
01:17:19,111 --> 01:17:20,305
up from the back court
to the front court.

1594
01:17:20,379 --> 01:17:21,641
Tracy Reynolds...

1595
01:17:21,714 --> 01:17:23,409
Calvin: Get him, guys.!
Come on, tie him up.!

1596
01:17:23,482 --> 01:17:24,744
Hey, hey! Stop it!

1597
01:17:24,817 --> 01:17:26,307
Get him, get him!

1598
01:17:26,385 --> 01:17:29,684
Ow! Aah! Stop!

1599
01:17:29,755 --> 01:17:33,384
Stop, I say! Stop!

1600
01:17:35,261 --> 01:17:38,856
Give me the combination
to the safe.

1601
01:17:38,931 --> 01:17:39,863
Geoff:
He's going towards the basket.

1602
01:17:39,932 --> 01:17:41,024
Windmill slam dunk.!

1603
01:17:41,100 --> 01:17:42,761
We better think of something else.

1604
01:17:42,835 --> 01:17:43,927
Get him with those!

1605
01:17:44,003 --> 01:17:44,935
Oh, yeah, get them.

1606
01:17:45,004 --> 01:17:46,266
Those are the hard chess men.

1607
01:17:46,338 --> 01:17:48,829
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I got his head.

1608
01:17:48,908 --> 01:17:50,375
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what's going on?

1609
01:17:50,442 --> 01:17:52,672
Oh, good, oh, good.
I am glad to see you.

1610
01:17:52,745 --> 01:17:54,838
All right,yeah,
I'm really glad you're here.

1611
01:17:54,914 --> 01:17:56,575
What are you doing?

1612
01:17:56,649 --> 01:17:58,207
I'm getting my sneakers back.

1613
01:17:58,284 --> 01:18:00,343
Let me out of this.

1614
01:18:00,419 --> 01:18:01,545
Wait. No, no.

1615
01:18:01,620 --> 01:18:02,678
Just hear me out, Ox.

1616
01:18:02,755 --> 01:18:03,744
Please.

1617
01:18:03,822 --> 01:18:06,188
You may hate me,
you may hate the world.

1618
01:18:06,258 --> 01:18:07,725
But whatever our differences,

1619
01:18:07,793 --> 01:18:10,159
you're still one of us.

1620
01:18:10,229 --> 01:18:11,196
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1621
01:18:11,263 --> 01:18:12,753
You're not one of him.

1622
01:18:12,831 --> 01:18:15,857
Well, heh heh,
don't listen to him.

1623
01:18:15,935 --> 01:18:18,529
No, Ox, don't listen to Bittleman.

1624
01:18:18,604 --> 01:18:20,367
He doesn't even care about you, Ox.

1625
01:18:20,439 --> 01:18:22,464
Oh, right, yeah,
I don't care about you.

1626
01:18:22,541 --> 01:18:25,772
Of course I care about you.
We're friends, right, man?

1627
01:18:25,844 --> 01:18:27,436
Right?

1628
01:18:33,819 --> 01:18:35,446
OK.

1629
01:18:35,521 --> 01:18:38,513
You just let me out of here,
you idiot.

1630
01:18:40,759 --> 01:18:43,557
I'm not an idiot.

1631
01:18:43,629 --> 01:18:45,426
- You got that?
- OK.

1632
01:18:45,497 --> 01:18:46,930
- OK?
- OK!

1633
01:18:46,999 --> 01:18:48,694
Geoff:
... will go on to the NBAplay-offs,

1634
01:18:48,767 --> 01:18:50,598
and it will be the fiirst
for the Knights...

1635
01:18:50,669 --> 01:18:53,331
Because I'm not the one
tied to a chair, am I?

1636
01:18:53,405 --> 01:18:54,895
Geoff:If Calvin Cambridge
is gonna get here,

1637
01:18:54,974 --> 01:18:58,307
he better get here quick.
Toronto running away...

1638
01:18:58,377 --> 01:18:59,309
I gotta get back to the game.

1639
01:18:59,378 --> 01:19:01,141
You know, if I was an idiot,

1640
01:19:01,213 --> 01:19:02,874
I wouldn't be able to remember

1641
01:19:02,948 --> 01:19:05,917
the combination to your safe, would I?

1642
01:19:08,587 --> 01:19:09,519
42 left...

1643
01:19:09,588 --> 01:19:11,249
Come on, Ox.
Come on, come on.

1644
01:19:11,323 --> 01:19:12,756
27 right...

1645
01:19:12,825 --> 01:19:14,417
Come on, one more time.
Come on, one more, one more.

1646
01:19:14,493 --> 01:19:16,961
...and 15 left.

1647
01:19:18,430 --> 01:19:20,398
- Yes!
- Yeah!

1648
01:19:25,004 --> 01:19:27,302
I'm gonna get you, Calvin!

1649
01:19:27,373 --> 01:19:28,567
I'm gonna get you!

1650
01:19:48,594 --> 01:19:50,027
What?!

1651
01:20:10,065 --> 01:20:11,555
- Hey!
- Whoa!

1652
01:20:11,633 --> 01:20:13,464
Darn it!

1653
01:20:36,858 --> 01:20:37,984
Whoa! Aaah!

1654
01:20:53,608 --> 01:20:54,597
No!

1655
01:21:25,140 --> 01:21:26,198
Ha ha!

1656
01:21:26,274 --> 01:21:27,366
Ah!

1657
01:21:30,445 --> 01:21:31,377
Unh!

1658
01:21:39,721 --> 01:21:41,814
Yeah, Murph!

1659
01:21:41,890 --> 01:21:44,324
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go!

1660
01:21:45,894 --> 01:21:47,054
See you inside!

1661
01:21:47,129 --> 01:21:48,926
- Good luck, Calvin!
- Go get 'em!

1662
01:21:57,139 --> 01:21:59,039
Give me the sneakers, Calvin.

1663
01:22:02,210 --> 01:22:04,974
Your game...

1664
01:22:05,047 --> 01:22:06,639
is over.

1665
01:22:14,623 --> 01:22:16,420
Aaah!

1666
01:22:16,491 --> 01:22:17,458
Uhh.

1667
01:22:17,526 --> 01:22:19,585
My game is just beginning.

1668
01:22:26,601 --> 01:22:28,398
Geoff: The third quarter
comes to an end,

1669
01:22:28,470 --> 01:22:30,734
and the Raptors
leading the Knights big

1670
01:22:30,806 --> 01:22:32,535
by 21 points.

1671
01:22:33,642 --> 01:22:34,734
Woman:
Yeah.! It's Calvin.!

1672
01:22:34,810 --> 01:22:36,801
There he is.

1673
01:22:36,878 --> 01:22:38,277
Ladies and gentlemen, he's here.!

1674
01:22:40,315 --> 01:22:42,146
Crowd: Calvin.! Calvin.!

1675
01:22:42,217 --> 01:22:43,741
Geoff:
Calvin Cambridge has arrived.

1676
01:22:43,819 --> 01:22:46,310
The crowd reacting
as he comes onto the court.

1677
01:22:46,388 --> 01:22:48,015
However, is it too late?

1678
01:22:48,090 --> 01:22:50,217
The Knights are trailing by 21 points.

1679
01:22:50,292 --> 01:22:51,919
They have never been
able to make up

1680
01:22:51,993 --> 01:22:53,119
that kind of a defiicit.

1681
01:22:53,195 --> 01:22:55,026
Calvin, where have you been?

1682
01:22:57,165 --> 01:22:58,655
I'm sorry, coach.

1683
01:22:58,733 --> 01:23:00,394
So am I.

1684
01:23:00,469 --> 01:23:02,027
Nobody shows up
after 3 quarters and plays.

1685
01:23:02,104 --> 01:23:03,128
Sit on the bench.

1686
01:23:03,205 --> 01:23:04,399
Wait a minute, coach.
You gotta play Calvin.

1687
01:23:04,473 --> 01:23:05,405
No.

1688
01:23:05,474 --> 01:23:06,406
Just listen to me for a minute, OK?

1689
01:23:06,475 --> 01:23:07,442
Now if it wasn't for him,

1690
01:23:07,509 --> 01:23:08,407
we wouldn't be here
in the fiirst place.

1691
01:23:08,477 --> 01:23:10,570
Now, listen, we can still do this,
but we're gonna need him.

1692
01:23:10,645 --> 01:23:12,977
Now, come on, we started as a team,
let's fiinish as a team.

1693
01:23:13,048 --> 01:23:14,015
Joad: Play the kid.

1694
01:23:14,082 --> 01:23:15,140
We could still win, coach.

1695
01:23:15,217 --> 01:23:16,149
We can.

1696
01:23:23,758 --> 01:23:24,816
Yeah! Yeah!

1697
01:23:24,893 --> 01:23:26,793
Geoff:
Here come the Knights.

1698
01:23:52,220 --> 01:23:53,983
Geoff:If I didn't see it
with my own eyes,

1699
01:23:54,055 --> 01:23:55,317
I wouldn't have believed it.

1700
01:23:55,390 --> 01:23:58,791
But they'rejust one point
behind the Raptors in this game.

1701
01:23:58,927 --> 01:24:00,622
We gotta steal the ball
on the inbound play.

1702
01:24:00,695 --> 01:24:02,663
And if we don't get the steal,
who do we foul?

1703
01:24:02,731 --> 01:24:04,562
They all shoot good free throws, coach.

1704
01:24:04,633 --> 01:24:07,033
Well, we better get that steal.
Ready?

1705
01:24:07,102 --> 01:24:08,763
- Players:Break.!
- Let's go.

1706
01:24:10,305 --> 01:24:11,897
Geoff: The Knights
need a steal right here.

1707
01:24:11,973 --> 01:24:13,736
Carter being guarded by Cambridge.

1708
01:24:13,808 --> 01:24:15,400
He comes in with it.
And he's got the ball...

1709
01:24:15,477 --> 01:24:17,172
It's stolen by Cambridge.!

1710
01:24:17,245 --> 01:24:19,179
What a big play by the little guy.!

1711
01:24:19,247 --> 01:24:20,976
Wagner: Time-out.!

1712
01:24:21,049 --> 01:24:22,107
Break!

1713
01:24:22,184 --> 01:24:23,708
Geoff:
Time-out called by the Knights.

1714
01:24:28,089 --> 01:24:29,488
Oh, no.

1715
01:24:31,259 --> 01:24:32,726
What's the matter?

1716
01:24:32,794 --> 01:24:35,160
I'm done, Trace.

1717
01:24:35,230 --> 01:24:36,993
What do you mean?

1718
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,025
It really wasn't me that was playing.

1719
01:24:41,102 --> 01:24:42,194
It was the sneakers.

1720
01:24:42,270 --> 01:24:45,171
Tracy, the sneakers were magic.

1721
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:47,071
Now they're gone.

1722
01:24:51,780 --> 01:24:52,747
Come on, now. No.

1723
01:24:52,814 --> 01:24:53,746
Now's not the time for jokes, OK?

1724
01:24:53,815 --> 01:24:56,545
I'm not playing games.

1725
01:24:56,618 --> 01:24:58,142
Listen to me.

1726
01:24:58,220 --> 01:25:00,450
We're gonna need you to win,
so you know what you gotta do?

1727
01:25:00,522 --> 01:25:02,752
You gotta be brave.

1728
01:25:02,824 --> 01:25:04,291
I believe in you.

1729
01:25:06,461 --> 01:25:09,521
Coach Wagner:
All right. Tracy inbounds to Calvin.

1730
01:25:09,598 --> 01:25:10,963
Calvin,Joad's gonna set you a pick.

1731
01:25:11,032 --> 01:25:13,762
If they double-team you,
get the ball back to Tracy.

1732
01:25:13,835 --> 01:25:15,826
Listen, guys.

1733
01:25:17,772 --> 01:25:21,469
Whether we make the play-offs or not,
it's gonna be my last game.

1734
01:25:21,543 --> 01:25:22,635
- What?!
- What?!

1735
01:25:22,711 --> 01:25:24,303
Player:
What are you saying, man?

1736
01:25:24,379 --> 01:25:26,438
I'm ready to be a regular kid again.

1737
01:25:26,514 --> 01:25:28,914
It's what I want.

1738
01:25:31,119 --> 01:25:33,349
Come on, y'all.
I got faith in you guys.

1739
01:25:33,421 --> 01:25:35,184
Let's go out,
and let's go win this thing, man.

1740
01:25:35,257 --> 01:25:37,748
Come on, now. Let's go.
Let's go, let's play.

1741
01:25:38,927 --> 01:25:40,827
Teamwork on 3.
1... 2... 3.

1742
01:25:40,895 --> 01:25:42,328
All: Teamwork!

1743
01:25:42,397 --> 01:25:44,126
Geoff:Biggest moment
of the season for the Knights.

1744
01:25:44,199 --> 01:25:45,393
It comes in to Calvin Cambridge.

1745
01:25:45,467 --> 01:25:48,368
The little guy goes to the dribble
against Vince Carter.

1746
01:25:48,436 --> 01:25:49,334
Drives right,
the shake-and-bake...

1747
01:25:49,404 --> 01:25:50,962
It didn't work this time.!

1748
01:25:51,039 --> 01:25:52,472
I can't do this.

1749
01:25:52,540 --> 01:25:53,734
What are you doing?

1750
01:26:08,423 --> 01:26:10,254
You can do it!

1751
01:26:20,568 --> 01:26:22,297
Calvin:Shoot it.!

1752
01:26:26,374 --> 01:26:27,466
Yeah!

1753
01:26:27,542 --> 01:26:30,568
Geoff: The Knights win.!
The Knights win.!

1754
01:26:30,645 --> 01:26:31,976
Ladies and gentlemen,

1755
01:26:32,047 --> 01:26:34,072
the Knights are going
to the NBAplay-offs

1756
01:26:34,149 --> 01:26:37,607
for the fiirst time
in franchise history.!

1757
01:26:37,686 --> 01:26:39,551
Unbelievable.!

1758
01:27:00,108 --> 01:27:01,166
Yes!

1759
01:27:01,242 --> 01:27:03,574
Play-offs, baby!

1760
01:27:05,980 --> 01:27:06,912
We did it, man!

1761
01:27:06,981 --> 01:27:08,676
Yeah, man, we did.

1762
01:27:16,458 --> 01:27:18,517
Guess I won't be seeing you anymore?

1763
01:27:18,593 --> 01:27:19,685
Hey, Trace, come on, man.

1764
01:27:19,761 --> 01:27:21,388
The press wants to see us, man.
Come on.

1765
01:27:21,463 --> 01:27:22,896
Oh, Calvin.

1766
01:27:22,964 --> 01:27:24,829
Congratulations, my dear.

1767
01:27:24,899 --> 01:27:26,560
We're going to Le Cirque
to celebrate.

1768
01:27:26,634 --> 01:27:27,760
You'll love the French cooking.

1769
01:27:27,836 --> 01:27:29,235
Oh,yes.

1770
01:27:29,304 --> 01:27:31,363
Um, I'll meet you guys
outside at the car, OK?

1771
01:27:31,439 --> 01:27:32,371
Oh, OK.

1772
01:27:32,440 --> 01:27:33,532
All right, dear.

1773
01:27:33,608 --> 01:27:34,540
We're so proud of you.

1774
01:27:34,609 --> 01:27:36,167
Wonderful,just wonderful.

1775
01:27:38,613 --> 01:27:39,773
Play-offs, play-offs!

1776
01:27:39,848 --> 01:27:41,975
Play-offs!
Yeah!

1777
01:27:49,591 --> 01:27:52,059
Congratulations, Calvin.

1778
01:27:52,127 --> 01:27:53,389
I'm gonna miss you, coach.

1779
01:27:54,562 --> 01:27:56,154
We're gonna miss you, too.

1780
01:27:56,231 --> 01:27:59,496
But I'm glad you fiinally got
what you really needed.

1781
01:27:59,567 --> 01:28:02,593
There'll always be a place
on this team for you.

1782
01:28:02,670 --> 01:28:04,137
Thanks, coach.

1783
01:28:07,208 --> 01:28:08,140
Good luck.

1784
01:28:43,344 --> 01:28:45,278
I wonder what's keeping Calvin?

1785
01:29:09,204 --> 01:29:10,398
Wow.

1786
01:29:10,472 --> 01:29:12,872
Never thought
you'd turn down the Boyds.

1787
01:29:14,275 --> 01:29:15,799
Me, neither.

1788
01:29:17,479 --> 01:29:20,744
Somehow, it just didn't feel right.

1789
01:29:24,152 --> 01:29:25,551
Welcome back.

1790
01:29:26,688 --> 01:29:27,916
Thanks, Murph.

1791
01:29:29,324 --> 01:29:30,291
Come on.

1792
01:29:41,469 --> 01:29:43,835
So, man...

1793
01:29:43,905 --> 01:29:45,634
you gotta tell me.

1794
01:29:45,707 --> 01:29:49,165
What was the best part
about being in the NBA?

1795
01:29:51,346 --> 01:29:52,608
Room service.

1796
01:29:52,680 --> 01:29:54,409
Room service?

1797
01:29:54,482 --> 01:29:55,506
What's room service?

1798
01:29:55,583 --> 01:29:56,880
You're in your hotel room.

1799
01:29:56,951 --> 01:29:59,181
You pick up the phone,
you dial 6.

1800
01:29:59,254 --> 01:30:00,881
Tell 'em what food you want,

1801
01:30:03,464 --> 01:30:04,522
they'll bring the food
up to your hotel room...

1802
01:30:04,599 --> 01:30:05,861
for free.

1803
01:30:05,933 --> 01:30:08,800
Nah. You're just...
You're just messin' with me, right?

1804
01:30:08,870 --> 01:30:10,667
Nah, not at all.

1805
01:30:12,340 --> 01:30:14,274
We should have that
around here sometime.

1806
01:30:16,210 --> 01:30:19,407
We should.

1807
01:30:21,349 --> 01:30:22,680
Room service?

1808
01:30:28,489 --> 01:30:29,820
Tracy.

1809
01:30:29,891 --> 01:30:31,518
So now you're telling me

1810
01:30:31,592 --> 01:30:34,561
that after everything
that we've been through together,

1811
01:30:34,629 --> 01:30:36,654
that's what you like best?

1812
01:30:36,731 --> 01:30:39,029
Room service?

1813
01:30:39,100 --> 01:30:40,658
What are you doing here?

1814
01:30:45,139 --> 01:30:46,470
I'm here with the team.

1815
01:30:48,242 --> 01:30:50,369
You see, the Knights are
sponsoring the home now.

1816
01:30:53,247 --> 01:30:54,839
That's... That's great.

1817
01:30:59,987 --> 01:31:02,547
Guys, guys, uh,
a little to the left.

1818
01:31:02,623 --> 01:31:03,647
How's that?

1819
01:31:03,724 --> 01:31:05,817
That's good. Good.

1820
01:31:05,893 --> 01:31:09,454
Reg, whatever happened to the guy
that used to run this place? Bittleman?

1821
01:31:09,530 --> 01:31:12,260
No one's seen him since
Calvin's last game.

1822
01:31:12,333 --> 01:31:14,563
Something about a bet
he didn't have the money to cover.

1823
01:31:22,310 --> 01:31:24,278
There's gonna be
a lot of changes around here.

1824
01:31:24,345 --> 01:31:27,314
Yeah. I can see that already.

1825
01:31:27,381 --> 01:31:28,541
Yes.

1826
01:31:28,616 --> 01:31:31,050
Yeah. Too bad you're not
gonna be around to enjoy it.

1827
01:31:31,118 --> 01:31:33,211
What do you mean?

1828
01:31:33,287 --> 01:31:36,620
Well, things are going
great with the team now.

1829
01:31:36,691 --> 01:31:39,319
Everything's going well with my father.

1830
01:31:39,393 --> 01:31:41,793
I have furniture in the house,

1831
01:31:41,863 --> 01:31:43,728
but still something's missing.

1832
01:31:45,967 --> 01:31:48,936
And I heard it through the grapevine
that you're still looking for a father.

1833
01:31:50,238 --> 01:31:51,227
Yeah.

1834
01:31:51,305 --> 01:31:52,237
Yeah?

1835
01:31:56,177 --> 01:31:57,610
That's great.

1836
01:31:59,547 --> 01:32:02,038
Because what I'm missing is a son.

1837
01:32:20,601 --> 01:32:22,899
Thanks... Dad.

1838
01:32:25,539 --> 01:32:26,904
Murph!

1839
01:32:26,974 --> 01:32:28,066
Hey, Murph, come here.

1840
01:32:31,379 --> 01:32:33,244
Um, you know what today is, right?

1841
01:32:33,314 --> 01:32:34,281
What?

1842
01:32:34,348 --> 01:32:35,440
It's 2-for-1 orphan day.

1843
01:32:35,516 --> 01:32:36,983
You take one orphan,

1844
01:32:37,051 --> 01:32:39,212
and then you get another one.

1845
01:32:39,287 --> 01:32:42,347
2- for-1 orphan day.

1846
01:32:42,423 --> 01:32:45,824
I mean, if that's OKwith you.

1847
01:32:45,893 --> 01:32:47,417
Hey, Murph.

1848
01:32:47,495 --> 01:32:48,757
Hey, T-time.

1849
01:32:48,829 --> 01:32:51,161
You know, I'm gonna take
Calvin home with me today.

1850
01:32:52,233 --> 01:32:54,997
Congratulations.

1851
01:32:55,069 --> 01:32:56,001
Thanks.

1852
01:32:56,070 --> 01:32:57,094
But you know what?

1853
01:32:57,171 --> 01:32:59,935
We were kinda hoping
that you'd come, too.

1854
01:33:01,742 --> 01:33:02,834
You mean...

1855
01:33:02,910 --> 01:33:05,378
Murph, we're going home.

1856
01:33:05,446 --> 01:33:06,777
We're going home!

1857
01:33:08,582 --> 01:33:09,514
Yeah.

1858
01:33:09,583 --> 01:33:11,210
That's right, we're going home.

1859
01:33:11,285 --> 01:33:12,309
- Yeah.
- Dad?

1860
01:33:12,386 --> 01:33:13,751
Can we get an allowance?

1861
01:33:13,821 --> 01:33:14,753
Allowance?

1862
01:33:14,822 --> 01:33:16,983
- Yeah. Can I drive the Escalade home?
- You wanna drive the what?

1863
01:33:17,058 --> 01:33:18,082
Do we get season tickets?

1864
01:33:18,159 --> 01:33:19,626
Tracy: Whoo.! Ha ha.!

1865
01:33:39,213 --> 01:33:41,010
All right, let's get some sleep, guys.

1866
01:33:41,082 --> 01:33:42,276
Here you go.

1867
01:33:45,720 --> 01:33:47,244
All right.
Good night, guys.

1868
01:33:47,321 --> 01:33:50,379
Good night, Dad.

1869
01:33:50,458 --> 01:33:51,686
Hey, you want me
to leave the light on for you?

1870
01:33:54,862 --> 01:33:56,796
Nah, I'm cool.

1871
01:34:18,019 --> 01:34:19,850
What's up, sucka?

1872
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:20,909
Ha ha ha!

1873
01:34:22,023 --> 01:34:23,422
Ha ha!

1874
01:34:23,491 --> 01:34:24,981
How was that?

1875
01:34:25,059 --> 01:34:26,356
Which way?

1876
01:34:26,427 --> 01:34:27,826
Lil'Bow Wow:

1894
01:35:03,130 --> 01:35:04,461

1895
01:35:04,532 --> 01:35:05,760
#  This is all I hear # 

1896
01:35:05,833 --> 01:35:08,131

01:35:13,507 --> 01:35:15,441
#  To the point that
I just wanna take you home # 

1900
01:35:15,509 --> 01:35:18,376

1901
01:35:18,446 --> 01:35:20,937

# Represent that # 

1905
01:35:30,357 --> 01:35:31,915
Thank you very much.
Oh, we're cutting?

1906
01:35:31,992 --> 01:35:33,619
I don't even need to cut.
Don't cut. Don't cut.

1907
01:35:33,694 --> 01:35:34,820
Yeah, we are.

1908
01:35:34,895 --> 01:35:36,658
Oh, now I gotta act
before I play a game.

1909
01:35:36,730 --> 01:35:37,719
I gotta do that again.

1910
01:35:37,798 --> 01:35:39,527
Oh,you want me... Uh, here I come.

1911
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:40,692
I don't know what he's...

1912
01:35:40,768 --> 01:35:44,067
- Yeah,you're always...
- Ha ha ha ha.!

1913
01:35:46,107 --> 01:35:48,132
I ain't no actor, man.
I'm a basketball player.

1914
01:35:48,209 --> 01:35:49,335
I'm a great actor.

1915
01:35:49,410 --> 01:35:52,777
# Basketball # 

1916
01:35:52,847 --> 01:35:54,838
#  They're playing basketball # 

1917
01:35:54,915 --> 01:35:56,780
I'm about to drop,
I'm about to drop.!

1918

#  They're playing basketball # 

1920
01:36:01,889 --> 01:36:05,154
#  We love that basketball #
