1
00:00:44,322 --> 00:00:46,313
Mother!

2
00:00:48,727 --> 00:00:50,718
Mother!

3
00:00:53,064 --> 00:00:55,089
Moth...

4
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:58,499
Your mother
can't be with you anymore.

5
00:00:59,571 --> 00:01:01,562
Come.

6
00:01:37,175 --> 00:01:39,643
- Friend Owl.
- Excuse me, sir.

7
00:01:39,711 --> 00:01:42,202
I hope I'm not intruding, but...

8
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,215
well, I... I just had to come.

9
00:01:46,885 --> 00:01:49,410
Poor little fellow.

10
00:01:49,487 --> 00:01:52,479
So young to be without his mother.

11
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,889
Well, if I can be of any help...

12
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:01,021
Wait.

13
00:02:01,099 --> 00:02:03,829
I could use your help.

14
00:02:03,902 --> 00:02:07,201
Find me a suitable doe to raise Bambi.

15
00:02:07,272 --> 00:02:11,299
Oh, oh, yes.
Of course, yes.

16
00:02:11,376 --> 00:02:13,867
Food's so scarce.

17
00:02:13,945 --> 00:02:17,346
Does can barely feed themselves.

18
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:20,884
Perhaps you could...

19
00:02:20,952 --> 00:02:25,616
Me? You know as well as I do,
a prince looks after the herd.

20
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:27,487
Does care for the young.

21
00:02:27,559 --> 00:02:33,156
But you are his father,
and circumstances being what they are...

22
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:42,168
- Until spring.
- Oh, excellent.

23
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,971
After all, who better
to raise the young prince

24
00:02:46,044 --> 00:02:48,877
than the great prince himself?

25
00:05:46,324 --> 00:05:47,985
Ahem.

26
00:05:48,059 --> 00:05:50,391
Uh...

27
00:05:50,461 --> 00:05:52,122
Good morning.

28
00:05:52,196 --> 00:05:56,132
Bambi, a prince awakens
before the forest does.

29
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:00,637
If you're late again, I'll have no choice...

30
00:06:00,705 --> 00:06:02,969
What was that?

31
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:05,805
What was what?

32
00:06:06,744 --> 00:06:09,338
I-I guess it was my stomach.

33
00:06:09,414 --> 00:06:11,780
Then you should eat.

34
00:06:14,185 --> 00:06:16,312
Oh, well...

35
00:06:16,387 --> 00:06:20,653
I suppose I should
find you something to eat.

36
00:06:25,163 --> 00:06:27,495
Here.

37
00:06:30,201 --> 00:06:32,761
Urgh. No, thank you.

38
00:06:32,837 --> 00:06:36,034
- Have you ever tried it?
- Well, no.

39
00:06:36,107 --> 00:06:42,012
Then how do you know
you don't like it if you've never tried it?

40
00:06:43,948 --> 00:06:45,472
Hm?

41
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:48,383
Mm! Mm-hm!

42
00:06:48,453 --> 00:06:50,580
Urgh!

43
00:06:50,655 --> 00:06:54,751
Come along. We have to check
on the other deer in the South Wood.

44
00:06:54,826 --> 00:06:57,818
- Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!
- Bam...

45
00:06:57,895 --> 00:06:59,419
Bambi!

46
00:06:59,497 --> 00:07:03,558
A prince does not whoo-hoo.

47
00:07:03,634 --> 00:07:06,569
- He doesn't?
- He certainly does not.

48
00:07:06,637 --> 00:07:09,800
A prince maintains control at all times.

49
00:07:09,874 --> 00:07:13,503
Display dignity.
Walk with pride.

50
00:07:20,318 --> 00:07:23,879
Argh! Who-o-o-a!

51
00:07:24,522 --> 00:07:26,387
I'm OK!

52
00:07:30,995 --> 00:07:33,828
Agh! Agh! Agh! Agh! Agh!

53
00:07:33,898 --> 00:07:36,366
Ooh! Ooh!
Agh! Agh! Agh!

54
00:07:36,434 --> 00:07:38,994
Oh! Oh!
Cold! Cold!

55
00:07:50,548 --> 00:07:53,915
One, two...

56
00:07:53,985 --> 00:07:55,612
two...

57
00:07:55,853 --> 00:07:58,014
two...

58
00:08:03,394 --> 00:08:04,383
Argh!

59
00:08:26,684 --> 00:08:28,811
Whoa!

60
00:08:29,887 --> 00:08:33,516
Don't you think it'd be better
if we got a little closer?

61
00:08:33,591 --> 00:08:36,617
The distance
makes it easier to spot danger.

62
00:08:36,694 --> 00:08:38,821
Hm.

63
00:08:38,896 --> 00:08:42,423
But it sure makes it
harder to play with them.

64
00:08:44,001 --> 00:08:46,868
Play is a healthy part
of a young deer's development.

65
00:08:46,938 --> 00:08:50,203
- Is that so?
- Mm-hm. Mother says so.

66
00:08:50,274 --> 00:08:53,869
- One time, Mother and I were out...
- Bambi.

67
00:08:53,945 --> 00:08:57,403
- A fawn came over and wanted to play...
- Bambi.

68
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:04,114
I think it's best
to leave the past in the past.

69
00:09:04,188 --> 00:09:07,851
A prince does not look back,
only ahead.

70
00:09:07,925 --> 00:09:10,120
Oh. Yes, sir.

71
00:09:10,194 --> 00:09:13,960
Now, come.
We still have a lot of ground to cover today.

72
00:09:14,031 --> 00:09:15,896
Don't fall behind.

73
00:09:51,502 --> 00:09:53,834
Thumper!

74
00:09:53,905 --> 00:09:57,705
Bambi!
Boy, am I glad to see you.

75
00:09:57,775 --> 00:09:58,799
What's wrong?

76
00:09:58,876 --> 00:10:01,401
They've been after me all morning.

77
00:10:01,479 --> 00:10:04,573
- Who has?
- Oh, big brother!

78
00:10:04,649 --> 00:10:06,549
It's them!

79
00:10:12,657 --> 00:10:15,785
- Hello, Young Prince.
- Hello, Young Prince.

80
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:19,796
- Oh. Hello.
- Have you seen Thumper around?

81
00:10:20,731 --> 00:10:22,722
Uh-uh.

82
00:10:23,668 --> 00:10:26,364
I think he's over there.
Look, look.

83
00:10:28,673 --> 00:10:31,141
Oh, OK.

84
00:10:31,209 --> 00:10:33,803
I guess we will be leaving, then.

85
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:42,146
- Gotcha!
- Argh!

86
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:45,383
Mama says you're gonna
take us to see the groundhog.

87
00:10:45,456 --> 00:10:47,287
What she says goes.

88
00:10:47,358 --> 00:10:49,622
Well, she's not the boss of me.

89
00:10:49,694 --> 00:10:53,289
If I don't want to, Mama can't make me.

90
00:11:01,439 --> 00:11:05,876
- Hi, Mama.
- What did your father tell you?

91
00:11:05,943 --> 00:11:10,175
- 'Bout what?
- About playing with your sisters.

92
00:11:10,248 --> 00:11:13,149
Oh, that one.

93
00:11:14,218 --> 00:11:18,018
A family that plays together... um...

94
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:21,752
stays together...

95
00:11:22,994 --> 00:11:27,021
even if it means
taking your dumb sisters.

96
00:11:27,832 --> 00:11:30,096
Bambi!

97
00:11:31,402 --> 00:11:33,996
Coming!
I gotta go.

98
00:11:34,071 --> 00:11:38,371
But you can't go.
You can't leave me with the girls.

99
00:11:38,442 --> 00:11:42,435
Come on, Thumper.
You gotta take us to see the groundhog.

100
00:11:45,082 --> 00:11:46,913
Ahem.

101
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:13,207
Why don't you go with your friends
to see the groundhog?

102
00:12:13,277 --> 00:12:15,211
But I want to stay with you.

103
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,440
Yes, well...

104
00:12:18,349 --> 00:12:21,785
I have to check
on the South Meadow and it's very far.

105
00:12:21,852 --> 00:12:25,481
You go see the groundhog.
I'll meet you there later.

106
00:12:25,556 --> 00:12:28,024
Oh. OK.

107
00:12:28,092 --> 00:12:30,185
I'll meet ya.

108
00:12:32,563 --> 00:12:34,827
Hey, Thumper, wait for me!

109
00:12:41,372 --> 00:12:43,237
- You sit by me!
- No, no!

110
00:12:43,307 --> 00:12:46,276
Quiet! Um...

111
00:12:46,344 --> 00:12:48,141
First one there's who I sit by.

112
00:12:48,212 --> 00:12:51,648
- Hooray! It's gonna be me!
- Uh-uh, it's gonna be me!

113
00:12:51,716 --> 00:12:55,675
Sheesh! I'm sure glad
your father let you come.

114
00:12:55,753 --> 00:12:58,551
Oh. He understands.

115
00:12:58,622 --> 00:13:01,352
He-he and I are best pals.

116
00:13:14,004 --> 00:13:16,302
Wake up, Flower.
Wake up.

117
00:13:24,448 --> 00:13:28,441
Come on, Flower.
You're gonna miss the groundhog.

118
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:32,546
Gosh, I hope
the groundhog sees his shadow...

119
00:13:33,624 --> 00:13:37,788
so I can get back to hibernating.

120
00:13:37,862 --> 00:13:40,330
Attention, everyone. Attention.

121
00:13:40,398 --> 00:13:43,629
Everybody, gather round.

122
00:13:43,701 --> 00:13:46,693
We'll be starting
in just a few moments, yes.

123
00:13:46,771 --> 00:13:48,864
Now, there's plenty of room.

124
00:13:48,939 --> 00:13:53,239
Ma'am, could you just scoot over one?

125
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:55,471
Very nice.

126
00:13:58,349 --> 00:14:02,376
Oh, Young Prince.
This is a special occasion.

127
00:14:02,453 --> 00:14:05,149
We decided we'll all sit by you.

128
00:14:06,223 --> 00:14:08,851
Greetings, greetings.

129
00:14:08,926 --> 00:14:10,860
Each year we gather round

130
00:14:10,928 --> 00:14:15,956
to watch the groundhog
emerge from his winter slumber,

131
00:14:16,033 --> 00:14:18,524
for if he sees his shadow...

132
00:14:18,602 --> 00:14:21,070
...it means more winter!

133
00:14:21,138 --> 00:14:24,232
Yes.
But if he doesn't...

134
00:14:24,308 --> 00:14:26,606
Spring is on its way!

135
00:14:27,678 --> 00:14:28,940
Yes.

136
00:14:29,013 --> 00:14:33,643
Now, without any further interruptions...

137
00:14:34,452 --> 00:14:36,613
The groundhog!

138
00:14:39,256 --> 00:14:41,281
The groundhog!

139
00:14:49,533 --> 00:14:51,592
Where's the groundhog?

140
00:14:51,669 --> 00:14:55,799
Groundhog! Groundhog!
Groundhog! Groundhog! Groundhog!

141
00:14:55,873 --> 00:14:58,239
Now, what seems to be the problem?

142
00:14:58,309 --> 00:15:01,938
I'm afraid to go out there.
I'll see my shadow.

143
00:15:02,012 --> 00:15:04,446
Well, that's entirely the point, isn't it?

144
00:15:04,515 --> 00:15:06,608
- I don't care.
- Oh.

145
00:15:06,684 --> 00:15:09,744
Must we go through this every year?

146
00:15:19,063 --> 00:15:21,691
Hello, Bambi.

147
00:15:24,969 --> 00:15:27,267
Hi, Faline.

148
00:15:27,338 --> 00:15:30,739
- I almost didn't recognize you.
- Really?

149
00:15:30,808 --> 00:15:34,175
I-I guess it's 'cause
my spots are almost gone.

150
00:15:34,245 --> 00:15:37,442
And my antlers are coming in too.
Can you see 'em?

151
00:15:37,515 --> 00:15:39,346
Um, well...

152
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:42,044
I don't see anything.

153
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,452
Well, I don't.

154
00:15:48,926 --> 00:15:51,053
Whoa!

155
00:15:51,128 --> 00:15:52,595
Oh, well, yes.

156
00:15:52,663 --> 00:15:55,257
The groundhog!

157
00:15:55,332 --> 00:15:58,699
Oh, why me?
Oh, this is the last year.

158
00:15:58,769 --> 00:16:01,636
My nerves just can't take it anymore.

159
00:16:02,106 --> 00:16:06,304
- I see his shadow.
- More winter.

160
00:16:06,377 --> 00:16:09,505
More hibernating.

161
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:13,016
No shadow, no shadow.

162
00:16:15,052 --> 00:16:17,850
Please, no shadow.
Please don't let there be a shadow.

163
00:16:17,922 --> 00:16:20,686
Please don't let there be a shadow.

164
00:16:21,659 --> 00:16:24,651
No shadow.
No shadow.

165
00:16:24,728 --> 00:16:28,494
Oh, spring is here!
Spring is here!

166
00:16:31,402 --> 00:16:36,362
# Oh, let's sing a gay little spring song,
let's get together and sing

167
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,840
# Fa la la, roll de ay,
twit twit awee

168
00:16:38,909 --> 00:16:41,002
Oh, that song.

169
00:16:41,078 --> 00:16:44,172
Oh, I'll never be frightened again.

170
00:16:44,248 --> 00:16:46,239
- Boo!
- Argh!

171
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,846
Oh.

172
00:16:50,921 --> 00:16:52,889
Ah.

173
00:16:56,193 --> 00:16:59,788
It looks like
I scared the shadow right out of him.

174
00:16:59,863 --> 00:17:02,593
Did you see the look on his...

175
00:17:04,602 --> 00:17:05,694
Hey!

176
00:17:05,769 --> 00:17:08,897
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey!

177
00:17:10,441 --> 00:17:13,968
Where's everybody going?
Forest on fire?

178
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:17,510
Who are you?

179
00:17:17,581 --> 00:17:22,541
Name's Ronno,
and these are the boys - Stab and Jab.

180
00:17:23,621 --> 00:17:26,613
Well, I hope the three of you
have a nice day.

181
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:30,182
I wouldn't go that way if I were you.

182
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:32,922
That's where I saw a man.

183
00:17:32,997 --> 00:17:35,522
You saw a man?

184
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:37,362
Uh-huh.

185
00:17:37,434 --> 00:17:40,801
There I was, out in the meadow.

186
00:17:40,871 --> 00:17:45,137
Suddenly I heard this voice
luring me in.

187
00:17:45,209 --> 00:17:48,975
"I'm here, I'm here."

188
00:17:49,513 --> 00:17:55,213
See, man's got this stick that can
make his voice sound like one of us.

189
00:17:55,285 --> 00:17:58,049
But I'm way too smart for that,

190
00:17:58,122 --> 00:18:00,784
so I crept up on him...

191
00:18:00,858 --> 00:18:03,019
real quiet.

192
00:18:05,562 --> 00:18:09,794
Then bam!
I knocked him out with my trusty antlers.

193
00:18:13,137 --> 00:18:15,435
That's quite a story.

194
00:18:15,506 --> 00:18:17,872
- Oh, you think so?
- Mm-hm.

195
00:18:17,941 --> 00:18:19,875
It's... unbelievable.

196
00:18:19,943 --> 00:18:23,379
Yeah. Unbelievable.

197
00:18:23,447 --> 00:18:25,540
- You calling me a liar?
- No.

198
00:18:25,616 --> 00:18:28,346
- You wanna spar, do ya?
- No!

199
00:18:28,419 --> 00:18:30,580
Clobber him, Bambi.

200
00:18:30,654 --> 00:18:33,680
Bambi?
Isn't that a girl's name?

201
00:18:35,092 --> 00:18:37,151
Come on. Let's go.

202
00:18:37,227 --> 00:18:40,993
Just a little, friendly competition.

203
00:18:41,065 --> 00:18:43,192
Ronno!

204
00:18:43,767 --> 00:18:47,635
- Coming, Mother.
- Yeah. Maybe you should get going.

205
00:18:47,705 --> 00:18:51,232
Jeez, I was only
playing around with him.

206
00:18:51,308 --> 00:18:53,333
Isn't that right, Bambi?

207
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:56,140
- Ronno!
- I'm coming!

208
00:18:56,213 --> 00:18:58,977
Ma! How many times
do I have to tell you?

209
00:18:59,049 --> 00:19:01,847
Don't bother me
when I'm trying to make new friends.

210
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,511
Sorry, dear.

211
00:19:03,587 --> 00:19:05,487
You big mama's boy!

212
00:19:05,556 --> 00:19:09,788
Why don't you run home to your mama?
You big old mama's boy!

213
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,760
Thumper!

214
00:19:11,829 --> 00:19:13,421
Coming, Mama.

215
00:19:13,497 --> 00:19:15,556
Gotta go.
See you, Bambi.

216
00:19:15,632 --> 00:19:18,965
So tell me,
what did the groundhog see?

217
00:19:19,036 --> 00:19:21,368
See you, Bambi.

218
00:19:22,573 --> 00:19:27,875
- Do you want us to walk you home?
- No. My father's coming for me.

219
00:19:27,945 --> 00:19:31,881
Well, it was nice
to see you again, Bambi.

220
00:20:45,022 --> 00:20:46,956
Bambi.

221
00:20:52,763 --> 00:20:54,594
Mother?

222
00:21:07,044 --> 00:21:09,308
I miss you so much.

223
00:21:09,379 --> 00:21:11,711
Shh. There, there.

224
00:21:11,782 --> 00:21:15,411
It's going to be all right.
You'll see.

225
00:21:15,485 --> 00:21:18,511
Why did you have to go?

226
00:21:18,589 --> 00:21:21,820
Everything in the forest has its season.

227
00:21:21,892 --> 00:21:25,828
Where one thing falls, another grows.

228
00:21:25,896 --> 00:21:28,023
Maybe not what was there before,

229
00:21:28,098 --> 00:21:32,330
but something new and wonderful,
all the same.

230
00:21:32,402 --> 00:21:34,336
But I feel so alone.

231
00:21:34,404 --> 00:21:36,201
I'm always with you.

232
00:21:36,273 --> 00:21:40,334
Even when you can't see me,
I'm here.

233
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:42,241
I'm here.

234
00:21:42,479 --> 00:21:44,538
I'm here.

235
00:21:45,616 --> 00:21:47,777
<i> I'm here.</i>

236
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,554
<i>Hello.</i>

237
00:21:54,157 --> 00:21:56,182
Hello?

238
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:59,051
<i> I'm here.</i>

239
00:22:00,764 --> 00:22:02,789
Mother?

240
00:22:02,866 --> 00:22:04,925
<i> It's me.</i>

241
00:22:07,037 --> 00:22:08,664
<i>I'm here.</i>

242
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:13,536
<i>Hello.</i>

243
00:22:16,046 --> 00:22:18,571
<i>I'm here.</i>

244
00:22:18,649 --> 00:22:21,049
Wait!
I'm coming.

245
00:22:32,496 --> 00:22:34,327
Hello?

246
00:22:39,169 --> 00:22:41,660
<i> Hello.</i>

247
00:22:42,739 --> 00:22:45,469
<i>I'm here.</i>

248
00:22:45,542 --> 00:22:47,772
<i>It's me.</i>

249
00:22:48,946 --> 00:22:52,006
- Mother?
<i>- I'm here.</i>

250
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:55,643
<i>Hello.</i>

251
00:22:55,886 --> 00:22:58,081
<i>Hello.</i>

252
00:22:58,155 --> 00:23:00,214
<i>I'm here.</i>

253
00:23:20,777 --> 00:23:22,039
Bambi!

254
00:23:31,688 --> 00:23:33,815
Run, Bambi!

255
00:23:53,977 --> 00:23:55,808
Run, Bambi!

256
00:23:55,879 --> 00:23:57,642
Go! Now!

257
00:24:13,663 --> 00:24:16,257
But it was Mother.
I heard her voice.

258
00:24:16,333 --> 00:24:19,928
- It was one of man's tricks.
- I'm sorry.

259
00:24:20,003 --> 00:24:23,962
What if I hadn't gotten there in time?
You could have been...

260
00:24:24,041 --> 00:24:29,445
When I tell you to run, you run.
Never freeze like that, ever!

261
00:24:29,513 --> 00:24:32,710
I'm... I'm sorry.

262
00:24:40,057 --> 00:24:42,321
Let's go home.

263
00:25:04,481 --> 00:25:07,973
She's never coming back, is she?

264
00:25:14,324 --> 00:25:16,155
No.

265
00:25:54,197 --> 00:25:57,223
- Friend Owl.
- Hm?

266
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,734
Winter is coming to an end.

267
00:25:59,803 --> 00:26:05,571
You should have little trouble
finding a new home for Bambi.

268
00:26:13,016 --> 00:26:15,314
Big brother!

269
00:26:15,819 --> 00:26:18,879
Oh, big brother!

270
00:26:20,957 --> 00:26:23,118
Big brother!

271
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:30,629
Every time we turn our backs he's gone.

272
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:35,103
Search everywhere.
Leave no stone unturned.

273
00:26:41,011 --> 00:26:43,775
How come
we're hiding from your sisters?

274
00:26:43,847 --> 00:26:45,041
Shh!

275
00:26:45,115 --> 00:26:49,711
- I think they're sweet.
- Well, you don't have to live with them.

276
00:26:52,856 --> 00:26:54,824
Back up.

277
00:26:54,891 --> 00:26:57,451
Watch it!

278
00:26:58,361 --> 00:27:00,352
Come on! Push harder!

279
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:02,898
Agh!

280
00:27:02,966 --> 00:27:04,934
Sheesh.

281
00:27:05,001 --> 00:27:07,367
So, where are we off to today?

282
00:27:07,437 --> 00:27:10,270
You're going to stay near the den
where it's safe.

283
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:14,367
But I'm ready for danger,
for adventure, for... for...

284
00:27:14,444 --> 00:27:16,173
The den.

285
00:27:16,246 --> 00:27:18,544
Yeah. Yeah, good idea.

286
00:27:18,615 --> 00:27:20,845
I'll stay and guard the den.

287
00:27:33,196 --> 00:27:34,993
Hey, Bambi.

288
00:27:35,065 --> 00:27:37,693
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

289
00:27:37,767 --> 00:27:41,294
Come on.
You can tell your bestest friend.

290
00:27:41,371 --> 00:27:46,434
Well... my father
never takes me with him anymore.

291
00:27:46,509 --> 00:27:51,105
I guess I'm not
what a prince's son is supposed to be.

292
00:27:51,181 --> 00:27:54,639
- If I could just show him.
- Show him what?

293
00:27:54,718 --> 00:27:57,448
That I can be brave like him.

294
00:27:59,956 --> 00:28:04,154
If that's all it is, being brave is easy.

295
00:28:04,227 --> 00:28:06,593
- I can teach you.
- You can?

296
00:28:06,663 --> 00:28:10,155
Sure. Watch this.

297
00:28:10,233 --> 00:28:12,133
Aaar!

298
00:28:12,869 --> 00:28:15,064
I think he's got a hairball.

299
00:28:15,138 --> 00:28:18,596
No, I'm being brave, silly.

300
00:28:18,675 --> 00:28:23,305
The trick is to be scarier
than whatever's scaring you. See?

301
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:24,972
Grrr!

302
00:28:25,849 --> 00:28:27,476
Grrr!

303
00:28:28,818 --> 00:28:30,786
You look like a squirrel.

304
00:28:30,854 --> 00:28:32,879
Oh, oh, watch me, watch me!

305
00:28:32,956 --> 00:28:34,947
Grrr!

306
00:28:37,027 --> 00:28:39,689
E-e-ew, Flower!

307
00:28:39,763 --> 00:28:42,561
You just found your inner strength.

308
00:28:42,632 --> 00:28:45,567
Oh, gosh!

309
00:28:45,635 --> 00:28:48,365
OK. Now, stand very straight.

310
00:28:48,438 --> 00:28:50,303
Stick out your chest.

311
00:28:50,373 --> 00:28:56,369
Take the deepest breath
you ever took in your whole life.

312
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:00,811
Now let it out with a big grrr.

313
00:29:01,284 --> 00:29:03,650
Baa!

314
00:29:04,587 --> 00:29:08,079
You're gonna need a lot of practice.

315
00:29:08,158 --> 00:29:12,219
Come on. Do what I do.
I'm a mountain lion. Raargh!

316
00:29:12,295 --> 00:29:13,694
Oh. Oh!

317
00:29:13,763 --> 00:29:15,993
I'm a... a bear.

318
00:29:16,066 --> 00:29:18,159
Baa!

319
00:29:18,234 --> 00:29:20,862
I'm a turtle. Grrr.

320
00:29:22,906 --> 00:29:27,707
What? Turtles are so scary.

321
00:29:31,748 --> 00:29:33,841
Come on.
You can do it.

322
00:29:33,917 --> 00:29:35,976
- Raargh!
- Baa!

323
00:29:36,052 --> 00:29:39,818
Come on, now.
Watch this. Raargh!

324
00:29:39,889 --> 00:29:41,618
- Grrr!
- Baa!

325
00:29:41,691 --> 00:29:45,388
Yeah, that's it.
Come on. Try it again.

326
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:48,095
Baa!

327
00:29:48,164 --> 00:29:49,995
Yeah. That was good.

328
00:29:51,434 --> 00:29:52,560
Grrr!

329
00:29:52,635 --> 00:29:55,536
- Baa!
- Grrr!

330
00:29:55,605 --> 00:29:58,904
- Come on, come on!
- Baa!

331
00:29:58,975 --> 00:30:00,306
Argh!

332
00:30:01,177 --> 00:30:03,577
- Grrr!
- Raargh!

333
00:30:03,646 --> 00:30:05,978
Baa!

334
00:30:06,383 --> 00:30:09,648
Aaar!

335
00:30:09,719 --> 00:30:12,381
Baa!

336
00:30:12,455 --> 00:30:14,616
Yeah, that's it.

337
00:30:14,691 --> 00:30:17,421
Grrr!

338
00:30:17,494 --> 00:30:19,758
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

339
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:27,101
- Baa!
- Grrr!

340
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:29,001
Aaar!

341
00:30:32,208 --> 00:30:34,039
Grrr!

342
00:30:37,213 --> 00:30:39,909
Raargh!

343
00:30:42,352 --> 00:30:47,051
Watch this. Raargh!

344
00:30:49,225 --> 00:30:54,390
See? There's nothing to it.
All it takes is one good grrr.

345
00:30:54,931 --> 00:30:56,330
Grrr!

346
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:58,299
Porky pine!

347
00:30:59,068 --> 00:31:02,834
Get out and stay out,
you trespassing hooligans.

348
00:31:02,906 --> 00:31:06,865
Trashy, muddy paws.
Couldn't you have anything nice?

349
00:31:08,211 --> 00:31:11,112
Well, we can always swim across.

350
00:31:11,181 --> 00:31:13,172
Uh-oh.

351
00:31:14,584 --> 00:31:17,052
Let's go before he sees you.

352
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,588
No. This is it.

353
00:31:19,656 --> 00:31:22,420
I can show my dad how brave I am.

354
00:31:23,226 --> 00:31:26,161
You better hurry.

355
00:31:30,099 --> 00:31:33,591
Don't worry.
I'll take care of your dad.

356
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:40,601
And remember what I taught you.
Grrr!

357
00:31:49,452 --> 00:31:53,354
I'm gonna walk across this log.
Baa!

358
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:56,823
Get off my property, you pesky squirrel.

359
00:31:56,893 --> 00:32:00,294
I-I'm not a squirrel.
I'm the young prince.

360
00:32:00,363 --> 00:32:03,093
Ha! Where you going, Princey?

361
00:32:03,166 --> 00:32:05,191
Not this way.
Try again.

362
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:10,569
Help! Help!

363
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,575
There's this thing,
and it's got these eyes,

364
00:32:13,643 --> 00:32:16,168
and these claws like... grrr!

365
00:32:16,246 --> 00:32:19,704
And it walks around like this.
Hai, hai, hai.

366
00:32:19,782 --> 00:32:22,114
And, well, you gotta see it.

367
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,118
Well, come on!

368
00:32:29,425 --> 00:32:32,019
Ha! Try again!
Try again! Try again!

369
00:32:32,095 --> 00:32:34,859
You don't understand.
I have to get across.

370
00:32:34,931 --> 00:32:40,164
Go around. In my day, we didn't wander
willy-nilly onto someone's property.

371
00:32:40,236 --> 00:32:41,863
We took the long way.

372
00:32:41,938 --> 00:32:45,931
It sometimes took days,
weeks, in the pouring rain,

373
00:32:46,009 --> 00:32:50,070
'cause we had
a little thing called respect.

374
00:32:52,315 --> 00:32:54,044
Bambi, you did it!

375
00:32:54,117 --> 00:32:56,585
Yeah?
Oh, you did it all right.

376
00:32:59,122 --> 00:33:02,148
Behind you! Look out!

377
00:33:03,393 --> 00:33:05,224
Again!

378
00:33:07,363 --> 00:33:09,126
Come again!

379
00:33:09,198 --> 00:33:11,496
Hurry up!
It's right over here.

380
00:33:13,336 --> 00:33:15,463
Oops. Wrong way.
Nothing here.

381
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,235
Whoa!

382
00:33:24,747 --> 00:33:27,272
Whoa!

383
00:33:30,987 --> 00:33:34,252
- What was that?
- I didn't hear anything. Probably a bird.

384
00:33:34,324 --> 00:33:37,452
Yeah, that's it.
A bird. Ow!

385
00:33:37,527 --> 00:33:39,427
Oh, no.

386
00:33:39,495 --> 00:33:41,588
Ha! That'll teach you.

387
00:33:41,664 --> 00:33:47,125
Think twice before you trespass round here
again. Mind your own beeswax next time.

388
00:33:50,406 --> 00:33:53,204
Grrr, grrr, grrr.

389
00:33:54,277 --> 00:33:58,737
That's the problem with these kids today.
No respect. No respect at all.

390
00:33:58,815 --> 00:34:01,750
What are you looking at,
you big moose?

391
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:04,781
Ahem.

392
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:27,473
Bambi, are you OK?

393
00:34:27,543 --> 00:34:30,239
How does it look?

394
00:34:30,313 --> 00:34:32,042
Ew!

395
00:34:32,115 --> 00:34:36,074
I'm not gonna lie to you.
It ain't pretty.

396
00:34:36,152 --> 00:34:38,643
It's hopeless.
I'm a coward.

397
00:34:38,721 --> 00:34:41,281
- No. You're brave.
- Ow!

398
00:34:41,357 --> 00:34:46,090
- No one's ever got that far across before.
- Ow!

399
00:34:46,162 --> 00:34:49,757
That's the great thing about me.
I don't feel any pain.

400
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,968
Watch this.

401
00:34:53,036 --> 00:34:56,028
Argh! Oh!

402
00:34:56,105 --> 00:34:58,630
See? Nothing.

403
00:34:58,708 --> 00:35:00,266
Ow!

404
00:35:00,343 --> 00:35:01,401
What was that?

405
00:35:01,477 --> 00:35:05,743
Ah, probably just some poor, dumb animal
caught in a trap. So anyways...

406
00:35:05,815 --> 00:35:08,147
- Ow!
- Bambi!

407
00:35:08,718 --> 00:35:12,119
Hey!
I wasn't finished talking about me.

408
00:35:13,189 --> 00:35:16,818
- Just one more.
- Bambi, what happened?

409
00:35:16,893 --> 00:35:19,259
Bambi got stuck by a porky pine.

410
00:35:19,328 --> 00:35:22,161
- A porcupine? Where?
- Hold still!

411
00:35:22,231 --> 00:35:23,926
- It was nothing.
- Are you hurt?

412
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,128
- Stop moving!
- I'm fine. Really. It's just...

413
00:35:27,203 --> 00:35:29,034
Ow!

414
00:35:29,105 --> 00:35:30,504
Got it.

415
00:35:30,573 --> 00:35:36,239
Bambi. I thought I recognized that scream.
I'm surprised to see you moving.

416
00:35:36,312 --> 00:35:39,873
- It was only a porcupine.
- No, no, no.

417
00:35:39,949 --> 00:35:42,941
I'm talking about
how you froze out on the meadow,

418
00:35:43,019 --> 00:35:45,886
and right in front of your father.

419
00:35:45,955 --> 00:35:48,890
- Ronno!
- Don't feel bad.

420
00:35:48,958 --> 00:35:53,691
If we didn't have cowards, we couldn't
tell who the brave ones are. Hm.

421
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:57,327
I'm not a coward.
Baa!

422
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,334
Oh, uh, yeah, sure, sure.
Come on. Let's go.

423
00:36:02,405 --> 00:36:05,272
- I'm staying here.
- Ah, come on.

424
00:36:05,341 --> 00:36:09,471
- Ronno, quit it.
- Leave her alone.

425
00:36:09,545 --> 00:36:13,447
Did you say something, Bambi?

426
00:36:13,516 --> 00:36:15,177
No. Uh, well...

427
00:36:15,251 --> 00:36:17,378
I mean, yes.

428
00:36:18,454 --> 00:36:21,787
Leave her alone. Please?

429
00:36:21,858 --> 00:36:23,485
You tell him, Bambi.

430
00:36:23,559 --> 00:36:28,496
Oh, wook. It's the wittle bunny
and the wittle skunk.

431
00:36:28,564 --> 00:36:33,399
Does the young prince play
with the wittle bunny and the wittle skunk?

432
00:36:36,906 --> 00:36:37,895
Grrr!

433
00:36:37,974 --> 00:36:40,135
Run!

434
00:36:42,779 --> 00:36:45,077
Run, Bambi!

435
00:36:55,691 --> 00:36:56,715
Aarrgh!

436
00:36:59,962 --> 00:37:01,862
Whoa!

437
00:37:01,931 --> 00:37:04,764
Other way! Other way!

438
00:37:05,201 --> 00:37:07,761
Turn around! Turn around!

439
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:14,140
Aaaarrrgh!

440
00:37:18,981 --> 00:37:21,245
We made it.

441
00:37:24,053 --> 00:37:25,918
What's the matter?

442
00:37:25,988 --> 00:37:28,456
Too scared? Uh-huh.

443
00:37:28,524 --> 00:37:31,687
Look at him.
Look at him shaking.

444
00:37:31,761 --> 00:37:35,527
Now who's the baby,
you big baby?

445
00:37:35,598 --> 00:37:38,089
- Whoa!
- Um...

446
00:37:38,968 --> 00:37:40,162
Hello.

447
00:37:40,236 --> 00:37:42,033
I told you to stay near the den.

448
00:37:42,104 --> 00:37:46,131
When I give you an order,
I expect you to...

449
00:37:47,376 --> 00:37:48,968
How did you...

450
00:37:50,446 --> 00:37:52,437
Did you jump?

451
00:37:53,516 --> 00:37:56,007
- Yes, sir.
- Hm.

452
00:37:56,085 --> 00:38:00,818
I didn't make a jump like that
until I had antlers.

453
00:38:09,665 --> 00:38:11,929
Yes. Well...

454
00:38:13,002 --> 00:38:15,903
We should be going...

455
00:38:15,972 --> 00:38:17,530
um...

456
00:38:17,607 --> 00:38:19,700
home.

457
00:38:19,775 --> 00:38:22,938
He's never said
anything nice like that before.

458
00:38:23,012 --> 00:38:25,708
I guess he saw how brave you were.

459
00:38:25,781 --> 00:38:29,649
Gosh, what a jump.
It was like flying.

460
00:38:29,719 --> 00:38:33,917
What's the big deal?
Anyone can make that jump.

461
00:38:34,991 --> 00:38:37,084
Aaaargh!

462
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:38,786
A-a-aarrgh!

463
00:38:52,074 --> 00:38:55,635
Come on.
You jumped further than this yesterday.

464
00:38:55,711 --> 00:38:58,373
I... don't know.

465
00:38:58,447 --> 00:39:02,213
You're not afraid, are you?

466
00:39:02,285 --> 00:39:05,584
You're too afraid.
You cannot jump.

467
00:39:05,655 --> 00:39:10,319
Ner-ner-ner ner-ner! Ner-ner-ner ner-ner!
Ner-ner-ner ner-ner! Ner-ner-ner...

468
00:39:10,393 --> 00:39:12,759
Argh!

469
00:39:14,163 --> 00:39:15,152
Whoo-hoo!

470
00:39:15,231 --> 00:39:17,199
- You did it.
- Let's do it again.

471
00:39:17,266 --> 00:39:19,598
And this time put it out further.

472
00:39:19,669 --> 00:39:22,001
Come on, Bambi.
You can do it.

473
00:39:22,071 --> 00:39:24,164
Wait till your dad sees this.

474
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:28,904
- Oh. Good morning, sir.
- Ahem. Morning, Owl.

475
00:39:28,978 --> 00:39:33,745
Just thought I'd let you know
that the search is off to a flying start.

476
00:39:33,816 --> 00:39:35,579
Oh! Yes, well,

477
00:39:35,651 --> 00:39:42,056
no pun intended...
with the... flying... as I'm an... an owl.

478
00:39:43,726 --> 00:39:45,557
Yes, well.

479
00:39:45,628 --> 00:39:49,655
I've met with several does already
who would make excellent mothers.

480
00:39:49,732 --> 00:39:55,136
- Put it out further!
- Unless you've changed your mind?

481
00:39:55,204 --> 00:39:59,231
- No, I have not.
- Uh... uh...

482
00:39:59,308 --> 00:40:02,243
Hey, watch this!
Watch this!

483
00:40:02,311 --> 00:40:03,403
Whoa!

484
00:40:03,479 --> 00:40:07,506
- Did I make it?
- Yep. You did it.

485
00:40:08,784 --> 00:40:12,652
- What exactly are you doing?
- I'm practicing my jumps.

486
00:40:12,722 --> 00:40:15,418
- Yeah. See?
- Mm.

487
00:40:15,491 --> 00:40:17,356
I see.

488
00:40:21,697 --> 00:40:25,599
I don't get it.
Yesterday he really liked it.

489
00:40:25,668 --> 00:40:28,432
What's he doing, anyway?

490
00:40:28,504 --> 00:40:32,235
I don't know,
but he sure does an awful lot of it.

491
00:40:32,308 --> 00:40:34,105
Well, why don't you ask him?

492
00:40:34,176 --> 00:40:37,236
Oh, he looks busy.
I better not.

493
00:40:37,313 --> 00:40:40,111
Parents like it
when you ask them questions -

494
00:40:40,182 --> 00:40:43,015
lots and lots of questions.

495
00:40:43,085 --> 00:40:46,782
- Really?
- Go on. I'm right behind you.

496
00:41:01,704 --> 00:41:04,036
Um... uh...

497
00:41:05,841 --> 00:41:08,969
- What are you doing?
- Observing.

498
00:41:09,045 --> 00:41:11,536
Oh. Observing.

499
00:41:13,616 --> 00:41:17,074
- What's observing?
- Well, it's...

500
00:41:18,154 --> 00:41:19,985
it's...

501
00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:25,192
- It's difficult to explain.
- Oh.

502
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:30,763
You have to look, listen...

503
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:34,130
and smell, all at the same time.

504
00:41:34,203 --> 00:41:36,194
Oh, I can do that.

505
00:41:36,272 --> 00:41:38,263
Look, listen, smell.

506
00:41:40,976 --> 00:41:42,967
Hm.

507
00:41:43,045 --> 00:41:45,878
Try to feel the forest around you.

508
00:41:51,153 --> 00:41:53,121
I don't feel anything.

509
00:41:54,156 --> 00:41:57,751
- Does playing in the meadow.
- How do you know?

510
00:41:57,827 --> 00:42:00,261
I feel it in my hooves.

511
00:42:00,329 --> 00:42:04,925
If there was danger,
they'd know to stomp, and I'd run to them.

512
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,494
- But wouldn't you be scared?
- Perhaps, but I would still run to them.

513
00:42:09,572 --> 00:42:15,533
A prince may be afraid,
but he can't let fear stop him from acting.

514
00:42:15,611 --> 00:42:18,705
Wow. You know everything.

515
00:42:20,349 --> 00:42:23,443
Not everything.

516
00:42:23,519 --> 00:42:26,511
Well, the forest is waiting.

517
00:42:32,795 --> 00:42:35,161
Are you coming?

518
00:42:35,231 --> 00:42:37,426
Oh! Sure!

519
00:42:43,973 --> 00:42:45,770
Big brother!

520
00:42:45,841 --> 00:42:48,571
Oh, for crying out loud!

521
00:42:48,644 --> 00:42:51,613
Feel the forest.
Feel the forest.

522
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,580
- Feel the forest.
- Bambi!

523
00:42:53,649 --> 00:42:56,209
Feel the...

524
00:42:56,285 --> 00:42:58,116
Felt it.

525
00:43:53,909 --> 00:43:56,207
Grrr!

526
00:43:59,882 --> 00:44:01,144
Whoa!

527
00:44:16,265 --> 00:44:19,996
I hear it, I hear it!

528
00:44:36,619 --> 00:44:38,849
Hm.

529
00:44:43,559 --> 00:44:45,857
When will I get my antlers?

530
00:44:46,929 --> 00:44:50,421
Won't be long now
if you're anything like I was.

531
00:44:50,933 --> 00:44:52,195
Am I?

532
00:44:52,268 --> 00:44:55,431
Well, only one way to find out.

533
00:45:01,310 --> 00:45:03,175
Wow!

534
00:45:40,015 --> 00:45:42,916
Whoo-hoo!

535
00:46:26,195 --> 00:46:29,028
Bambi, time to go to sleep.

536
00:46:29,732 --> 00:46:32,667
But I can't sleep.
I'm wide awake.

537
00:46:32,735 --> 00:46:34,464
Try.

538
00:46:34,536 --> 00:46:36,800
OK, I'll try.

539
00:46:40,509 --> 00:46:42,739
It was funny
when you chased that cricket,

540
00:46:42,811 --> 00:46:45,006
then there was one more,
then one more.

541
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:47,310
Yes, yes.

542
00:46:47,383 --> 00:46:49,783
Now, get some sleep.

543
00:46:51,587 --> 00:46:54,556
Flower sleeps all winter.

544
00:46:54,623 --> 00:46:56,113
Why do we sleep?

545
00:46:56,191 --> 00:46:58,819
Everything must get rest.

546
00:46:58,894 --> 00:47:02,557
Some at night, some during the day.

547
00:47:03,832 --> 00:47:06,164
Some not at all.

548
00:47:11,907 --> 00:47:14,137
Mother's resting now, isn't she?

549
00:47:14,209 --> 00:47:15,938
Oh, I forgot.

550
00:47:16,011 --> 00:47:20,505
A prince leaves the past
in the past, right?

551
00:47:24,219 --> 00:47:26,687
That's enough questions for today.

552
00:47:26,755 --> 00:47:28,552
Now, please get some sleep.

553
00:47:28,624 --> 00:47:30,615
OK.

554
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:33,357
Good night.

555
00:48:12,601 --> 00:48:14,432
Grrr!

556
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:20,836
Come on, sleepyhead.

557
00:48:20,909 --> 00:48:25,369
Remind me never to let you
eat blossoms before bedtime.

558
00:48:25,447 --> 00:48:27,540
Wait. I hear trouble.

559
00:48:27,616 --> 00:48:29,243
What? What?

560
00:48:29,318 --> 00:48:31,718
Hornet nest - antler-high.

561
00:48:32,788 --> 00:48:35,086
Very good.

562
00:48:35,157 --> 00:48:38,957
- Wait! Now I see trouble.
- Where? Where?

563
00:48:39,027 --> 00:48:41,325
Rival stag, dead ahead.

564
00:48:41,396 --> 00:48:44,490
Ah, he's pretty small.
Shouldn't be any trouble.

565
00:48:44,566 --> 00:48:47,626
Oh, yeah?
I can be plenty of trouble.

566
00:48:47,703 --> 00:48:51,036
- No, not you.
- Yes, me.

567
00:48:51,106 --> 00:48:52,130
Yah!

568
00:48:52,207 --> 00:48:55,802
Now you've had it.

569
00:48:55,878 --> 00:48:56,970
Gotcha!

570
00:48:57,045 --> 00:48:59,240
Now who's got who?

571
00:49:00,983 --> 00:49:04,282
- There you two are. Well, yes.
- Hello, Friend Owl.

572
00:49:04,353 --> 00:49:06,321
Well, he-hello.

573
00:49:06,388 --> 00:49:09,448
I've... I've been
meaning to speak to you.

574
00:49:09,525 --> 00:49:13,256
I've been looking everywhere.
I thought you'd be by the meadow now.

575
00:49:13,328 --> 00:49:16,092
I'm afraid I got a little...

576
00:49:17,165 --> 00:49:18,427
distracted.

577
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:23,096
So I see. Well, no matter.
I usually find what I'm after.

578
00:49:23,171 --> 00:49:27,835
Speaking of which,
there's someone I'd like you to meet.

579
00:49:27,910 --> 00:49:30,538
- Mena.
- Great Prince.

580
00:49:30,612 --> 00:49:33,137
- Bambi, go to the den.
- Bambi.

581
00:49:33,215 --> 00:49:37,208
I've heard so much about you. You know,
your mama and I grew up together.

582
00:49:37,286 --> 00:49:39,345
- You did?
- Go to the den.

583
00:49:39,421 --> 00:49:41,184
But I want to hear about Mother.

584
00:49:41,256 --> 00:49:45,192
There'll be plenty of time for that
once you're settled in your new home.

585
00:49:47,229 --> 00:49:49,060
You're sending me away?

586
00:49:49,131 --> 00:49:51,565
No. Just...
just let me explain.

587
00:49:51,633 --> 00:49:53,828
But I did everything you said.

588
00:49:53,902 --> 00:49:57,736
- I even heard with my hooves.
- Bambi, a prince does not...

589
00:49:57,806 --> 00:50:00,866
- That's all you care about - not me.
- Don't speak to me...

590
00:50:00,943 --> 00:50:04,276
I wish Mother was here instead of you!

591
00:50:06,615 --> 00:50:11,746
Oh, my, my, my. Well, I've certainly
made a muddle of things.

592
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:13,845
No. This is my fault.

593
00:50:14,923 --> 00:50:17,153
Bambi needs a mother.

594
00:50:17,225 --> 00:50:20,717
A prince should not be raising a child.

595
00:50:28,136 --> 00:50:30,764
I'm sure gonna miss you guys.

596
00:50:30,839 --> 00:50:33,535
Don't worry.
We'll see each other again.

597
00:50:33,609 --> 00:50:34,598
Uh-huh.

598
00:50:34,676 --> 00:50:38,112
We'll come visit you, if it's not too far.

599
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:41,980
- But Mama says it is too far.
- Shh!

600
00:50:42,818 --> 00:50:48,222
And if you get scared, just be scarier
than whatever's scaring you.

601
00:50:48,290 --> 00:50:50,053
Grrr!

602
00:50:50,125 --> 00:50:52,320
Bambi.

603
00:50:52,394 --> 00:50:54,259
It's time to go.

604
00:50:54,329 --> 00:50:56,991
I'll never forget any of you.

605
00:50:57,065 --> 00:51:01,934
Of course not.
Can't forget your bestest friend.

606
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:07,834
Being a prince means sacrifice.

607
00:51:08,910 --> 00:51:11,378
He must ignore his feelings

608
00:51:11,446 --> 00:51:14,347
and do what is best for others.

609
00:51:15,217 --> 00:51:17,811
Do you understand?

610
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:21,084
I'll visit you soon.

611
00:51:21,156 --> 00:51:22,953
Be good for Mena.

612
00:51:26,561 --> 00:51:29,223
And never forget...

613
00:51:29,297 --> 00:51:32,266
you are the prince.

614
00:52:41,670 --> 00:52:43,501
Hello, Princess.

615
00:52:44,873 --> 00:52:47,398
You're not leaving
without saying goodbye?

616
00:52:47,476 --> 00:52:50,536
Ah, and I thought we were pals.

617
00:52:50,612 --> 00:52:53,513
I feel for you.
Gosh, I really do.

618
00:52:53,582 --> 00:52:57,245
It's gotta be hard to have a father
that's so ashamed of you

619
00:52:57,319 --> 00:52:59,549
that he'd give you away.

620
00:53:05,927 --> 00:53:07,724
Oh, yeah?

621
00:53:10,766 --> 00:53:11,926
Bambi!

622
00:53:14,636 --> 00:53:17,070
Argh!

623
00:53:22,511 --> 00:53:24,911
Bambi!
Are you all right?

624
00:53:39,528 --> 00:53:41,962
Both of you get out of here. Now!

625
00:53:42,030 --> 00:53:44,021
Mommy!

626
00:53:45,634 --> 00:53:47,602
Bambi, run!

627
00:53:54,676 --> 00:53:56,473
Run, Bambi!

628
00:54:02,017 --> 00:54:05,145
Faster, Bambi.
Don't look back! Keep running!

629
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:07,381
Keep running!

630
00:54:14,930 --> 00:54:17,330
Bambi!

631
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:21,034
Baa!

632
00:54:35,050 --> 00:54:37,712
Where's Bambi?

633
00:54:49,898 --> 00:54:51,957
Look! It's Bambi!

634
00:54:53,034 --> 00:54:54,626
Argh!

635
00:54:54,703 --> 00:54:58,002
We gotta help him.
Make your brave face.

636
00:54:58,073 --> 00:55:01,008
- This one? Grrr!
- Braver!

637
00:55:01,076 --> 00:55:04,477
- This one? Grrr!
- No, no.

638
00:55:04,546 --> 00:55:08,209
Make the bravest face
you ever made in your whole life.

639
00:55:08,283 --> 00:55:10,478
This one? Grrr!

640
00:55:13,088 --> 00:55:15,750
That's the one.

641
00:55:35,844 --> 00:55:40,679
Aha! Looky who's here. I guess
somebody didn't learn their lesson.

642
00:55:40,749 --> 00:55:42,376
I learned plenty.

643
00:55:42,450 --> 00:55:44,179
Aaarrgh!

644
00:55:44,252 --> 00:55:46,516
Argh! Argh! Argh!
Argh! Argh! Argh!

645
00:55:46,588 --> 00:55:48,419
Argh!

646
00:57:36,197 --> 00:57:38,028
Bambi!

647
00:58:09,864 --> 00:58:12,094
Bambi!

648
00:58:23,878 --> 00:58:25,709
Bambi?

649
00:58:27,248 --> 00:58:29,409
Get up.

650
00:58:30,618 --> 00:58:32,381
Get up!

651
00:58:32,454 --> 00:58:34,786
A prince does not...

652
00:59:27,208 --> 00:59:29,039
Dad.

653
00:59:33,648 --> 00:59:36,139
I'm here.

654
00:59:37,118 --> 00:59:39,279
I'm here.

655
01:00:10,952 --> 01:00:13,318
It was raining and thundering.

656
01:00:13,388 --> 01:00:16,789
It didn't look good for the young prince.

657
01:00:16,858 --> 01:00:19,827
There were thousands of dogs,

658
01:00:19,894 --> 01:00:22,522
but Bambi wasn't a bit scared.

659
01:00:22,597 --> 01:00:25,691
They came closer...
and closer.

660
01:00:25,767 --> 01:00:28,600
There was nowhere to go.

661
01:00:30,004 --> 01:00:34,907
Then a dog that was tall as a tree
roared from the shadows,

662
01:00:34,976 --> 01:00:36,671
but Bambi was too fast.

663
01:00:36,744 --> 01:00:38,974
- He jumped up...
- High in the air.

664
01:00:40,548 --> 01:00:43,210
- And then came crashing...
- Crashing down.

665
01:00:43,284 --> 01:00:45,844
Right on the big dog's head.

666
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:50,016
Quiet. I'm telling it.
But the best part was...

667
01:00:50,091 --> 01:00:54,858
The best part was when Thumper helped
Flower make his bravest brave face.

668
01:00:54,929 --> 01:00:58,592
And scared all the dogs away.
Oops.

669
01:00:59,534 --> 01:01:01,729
Uh-huh.
That's how it went.

670
01:01:01,803 --> 01:01:03,930
Hooray for Thumper!

671
01:01:04,005 --> 01:01:06,439
- Look who's here.
- Oh, the young prince.

672
01:01:06,507 --> 01:01:08,805
Hooray!

673
01:01:08,876 --> 01:01:11,572
You know, they're OK for sisters.

674
01:01:11,646 --> 01:01:15,343
- Just too bad they're girls.
- Hey.

675
01:01:15,416 --> 01:01:16,849
Oops.

676
01:01:16,918 --> 01:01:19,250
What do you know, Bambi!

677
01:01:19,721 --> 01:01:21,552
Ooh!

678
01:01:24,058 --> 01:01:27,721
Well, looks like
those antlers are finally coming in.

679
01:01:27,795 --> 01:01:29,922
Really?
I hadn't noticed.

680
01:01:30,531 --> 01:01:33,091
Thumper's been telling us quite a story.

681
01:01:33,167 --> 01:01:37,729
Yes, yes.
The one with the thousands of dogs.

682
01:01:37,805 --> 01:01:38,931
Thousands?

683
01:01:39,007 --> 01:01:42,443
What can I say?
I'm a born storyteller.

684
01:01:42,510 --> 01:01:45,240
I'll bet it seemed like a thousand dogs.

685
01:01:47,081 --> 01:01:48,207
Oh!

686
01:01:48,283 --> 01:01:51,480
- Ooh!
- Uh... uh... uh...

687
01:01:52,487 --> 01:01:54,455
Twitterpated.

688
01:01:54,522 --> 01:01:56,888
What's twitterpated?

689
01:01:56,958 --> 01:02:01,622
Well, it's...
I'll tell you when you're older.

690
01:02:01,696 --> 01:02:05,325
Well, well, well.
If it isn't the young prince.

691
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:09,063
One of these days we'll meet up again,
and when we do...

692
01:02:09,137 --> 01:02:10,900
Whoa!

693
01:02:16,311 --> 01:02:17,471
Argh! Aaargh!

694
01:02:17,545 --> 01:02:20,605
Get it off! Get it off!
Mommy! Get it off!

695
01:02:20,682 --> 01:02:24,049
Mommy! Argh! Argh!

696
01:02:24,118 --> 01:02:28,487
See? I told you turtles were scary.

697
01:02:31,926 --> 01:02:35,555
Oh! I gotta get going.
My dad's waiting for me.

698
01:02:35,630 --> 01:02:37,996
Bye, Bambi.

699
01:02:39,067 --> 01:02:43,595
Ah, Bambi,
you never have time for us anymore.

700
01:02:43,671 --> 01:02:46,162
Yeah. Isn't it wonderful?

701
01:02:50,945 --> 01:02:53,209
Hey, Dad.
Where are we going today?

702
01:02:53,281 --> 01:02:55,613
We're already there.

703
01:03:12,533 --> 01:03:14,330
Wow.

704
01:03:14,402 --> 01:03:16,666
I never even knew this was here.

705
01:03:17,372 --> 01:03:19,772
Beautiful, isn't it?

706
01:03:26,714 --> 01:03:28,944
This is...

707
01:03:30,017 --> 01:03:33,384
This is where I first met your mother.

708
01:03:36,858 --> 01:03:39,850
- Really?
- Yes.

709
01:03:39,927 --> 01:03:42,225
I was just about your age.

710
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:47,061
What were you like?

711
01:03:47,135 --> 01:03:50,730
Me? Well, let me think.

712
01:03:52,940 --> 01:03:56,774
Actually, I was a lot like you.
