00:05:53,392 --> 00:05:55,883
Hey, Stevie, you okay?

2
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:59,844
I got...

3
00:06:04,107 --> 00:06:06,563
I got the wind knocked out of me.

4
00:06:06,651 --> 00:06:08,441
Looks like a cave.

5
00:06:18,989 --> 00:06:21,694
Stevie, what's goin' on?

6
00:06:26,537 --> 00:06:28,409
It's a human skull!

7
00:06:28,496 --> 00:06:31,780
- Toss it up here!
- No way! It's mine.

8
00:06:31,873 --> 00:06:35,489
Anyway, there's bones
all over the place, man!

9
00:06:49,715 --> 00:06:51,258
What the...

10
00:07:14,107 --> 00:07:16,183
Stevie?

11
00:07:16,275 --> 00:07:18,516
- Hey, Stevie!
- You okay?

12
00:07:21,943 --> 00:07:25,311
Hey, man... let's get outta here!

13
00:08:06,762 --> 00:08:08,837
Give me a 14-footer!

14
00:08:10,723 --> 00:08:15,015
This is Captain Miles Cooles.
Rescue situation in progress.

15
00:08:15,101 --> 00:08:19,511
Rope's in the hole.
Let's go. Two down.

16
00:08:26,358 --> 00:08:28,433
What ya got, TC? Talk to me.

17
00:08:30,734 --> 00:08:32,725
Do you see the boy?

18
00:08:36,445 --> 00:08:39,695
Come back, TC. You see the kid?

19
00:08:41,491 --> 00:08:43,364
Danny, check TC's radio.

20
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:45,904
TC?

21
00:08:45,994 --> 00:08:48,068
Glenn, Sal, in the hole!

22
00:09:19,597 --> 00:09:23,343
- Get those people outta here!
- Move 'em back!

23
00:09:23,432 --> 00:09:25,010
Move back, folks!

24
00:09:26,517 --> 00:09:32,519
I sent four men down there for the boy.
Report is, his eyes had turned black.

25
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:36,020
Now we've lost communication with my men.

26
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:53,113
What about my men?

27
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,733
What about my men!

28
00:10:12,754 --> 00:10:15,159
What the hell is this?

29
00:10:43,939 --> 00:10:45,646
It's Bronschweig.

30
00:10:45,732 --> 00:10:50,603
Sir, the impossible scenario
that we never planned for?

31
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:53,519
We'd better come up with a plan.

32
00:11:26,295 --> 00:11:28,999
We've evacuated the building.

33
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:34,674
- There's no trace of an explosive device.
- You sent the dogs through?

34
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,672
Yes, sir.

35
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,586
Send 'em through again.

36
00:11:41,263 --> 00:11:42,721
All right, guys.

37
00:11:42,805 --> 00:11:44,881
Let's do it again!

38
00:12:12,156 --> 00:12:14,030
Mulder, it's me.

39
00:12:14,116 --> 00:12:16,522
- Where are you, Scully?
- On the roof.

40
00:12:16,659 --> 00:12:19,445
- Findanyhing?
- No, I haven't.

41
00:12:20,245 --> 00:12:21,524
What's wrong?

42
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:25,320
I just climbed up 12 floors,
I'm hot, I'm thirsty...

43
00:12:25,415 --> 00:12:28,285
...and I'm wondering what I'm doing.

44
00:12:28,376 --> 00:12:30,248
You're looking fora bomb.

45
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:33,748
But the threat was made
on the Federal Building.

46
00:12:33,835 --> 00:12:35,910
They have that covered.

47
00:12:36,003 --> 00:12:42,751
When a bomb threat is called in, the rational
purpose of it is to allow us to find the bomb.

48
00:12:42,842 --> 00:12:47,300
The rational object of terrorism
is to promote terror.

49
00:12:47,385 --> 00:12:54,132
There's a model behavioural pattern for every
case where a threat has turned up a bomb.

50
00:12:54,431 --> 00:12:58,013
And ifwe ignore that data, as we have done...

51
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:02,892
...the chances are great that,
if there is a bomb, we might not find it.

52
00:13:02,979 --> 00:13:05,054
Lives could be lost.

53
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:06,095
Mulder?

54
00:13:07,439 --> 00:13:08,718
Mulder?

55
00:13:08,814 --> 00:13:09,596
Boom!

56
00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:11,099
Jesus, Mulder!

57
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,645
Whatever happened to hunches?

58
00:13:14,942 --> 00:13:17,943
Random acts of unpredictability.

59
00:13:18,029 --> 00:13:23,697
If we fail to anticipate the unforeseen
in a universe of infinite possibilities...

60
00:13:23,782 --> 00:13:29,533
...we may find ourselves at the mercy
of anything that cannot be categorised.

61
00:13:32,161 --> 00:13:36,159
What are we doin' up here, Scully?
It's hotter than hell.

62
00:13:40,167 --> 00:13:45,703
I know you're bored, but unconventional
thinking will only get you into trouble now.

63
00:13:45,794 --> 00:13:50,454
- Why do you think I'm bored?
- Quit looking for what isn't there.

64
00:13:50,546 --> 00:13:53,880
They've closed the X-Files.
We follow procedure now.

65
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:59,800
Let's make a bomb threat to Houston.
It's free-beer night at the Astrodome.

66
00:14:04,598 --> 00:14:05,546
Now what?

67
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,300
It's locked?

68
00:14:07,391 --> 00:14:10,475
So much for anticipating the unforeseen!

69
00:14:13,437 --> 00:14:15,843
- I had you.
- No, you didn't.

70
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:18,391
- I had you big time.
- You had nothing.

71
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,103
I saw you jiggle the handle.

72
00:14:22,191 --> 00:14:25,855
I saw your face.
There was a definite moment of panic.

73
00:14:25,943 --> 00:14:30,070
You've never seen me panic.
When I panic, I make this face.

74
00:14:30,154 --> 00:14:31,268
That was it.

75
00:14:31,363 --> 00:14:35,525
- You didn't see that face.
- I saw that face. You're buying.

76
00:14:37,617 --> 00:14:39,656
Coke? Pepsi? Saline IV?

77
00:14:39,743 --> 00:14:41,819
Somethin' sweet.

78
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:03,618
Scully.

79
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:05,367
I've found the bomb.

80
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:08,661
You're funny. Where are you, Mulder?

81
00:16:09,003 --> 00:16:11,080
I'm in the vending room.

82
00:16:12,673 --> 00:16:15,589
Is that you pounding?

83
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:18,876
Yeah. Get somebody to open that door.

84
00:16:19,677 --> 00:16:23,127
- Nice try, Mulder.
- It's in the soda machine.

85
00:16:23,221 --> 00:16:25,591
You got 14 minutes to evacuate.

86
00:16:27,308 --> 00:16:29,133
Come on, Mulder.

87
00:16:29,225 --> 00:16:30,635
13.56...

88
00:16:30,726 --> 00:16:32,801
13.54...

89
00:16:33,353 --> 00:16:35,391
13.52...

90
00:16:35,479 --> 00:16:36,722
13.50...

91
00:16:36,811 --> 00:16:40,973
You see a pattern emerging here, Scully?

92
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:50,018
I'll get you outta there!

93
00:16:55,406 --> 00:16:58,525
I need this building evacuated in ten minutes!

94
00:16:58,616 --> 00:17:03,029
Have the fire department block off
a one-mile radius around the building!

95
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,702
- Ten minutes?
- Don't think! Just make it happen!

96
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:09,283
This is Security...

97
00:17:10,665 --> 00:17:14,909
This is Special Agent Dana Scully.
I need to speak with SAC Michaud.

98
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,039
He's got the wrong building.

99
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:35,757
- Where is it?
- Vending machine.

100
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:37,804
He's locked in with it.

101
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:03,149
You know that face I just showed you?
I'm making it again.

102
00:18:03,655 --> 00:18:07,437
Move awayfrom the door.
We're coming through.

103
00:18:20,414 --> 00:18:21,576
Clear!

104
00:18:27,918 --> 00:18:32,164
Tell me that's just soda pop
in those canisters.

105
00:18:38,092 --> 00:18:41,092
It's just what it looks like. A big IED.

106
00:18:41,927 --> 00:18:44,843
Ten gallons of Astrolite.

107
00:18:45,888 --> 00:18:50,051
Okay. Get everybody outta here.
Clear the area.

108
00:18:51,601 --> 00:18:56,306
- Someone's gotta stay here with you.
- I gave you an order to evacuate.

109
00:18:56,393 --> 00:18:58,550
Can you defuse it?

110
00:18:59,269 --> 00:19:00,812
Yes, I can.

111
00:19:00,896 --> 00:19:05,059
- We got four minutes to find out.
- Did you hear what I said?

112
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:07,474
Get out!

113
00:19:11,361 --> 00:19:12,985
Come on, Mulder.

114
00:19:56,139 --> 00:19:58,130
Mulder, what are you doing!

115
00:19:58,223 --> 00:20:00,927
- Something's wrong!
- Mulder!

116
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:05,179
- Something's not right.
- Get in the car! There's no time!

117
00:20:06,434 --> 00:20:07,714
Let's go!

118
00:20:18,484 --> 00:20:20,559
Come on, come on!

119
00:21:25,774 --> 00:21:28,727
Next time, you're buying.

120
00:21:42,451 --> 00:21:45,735
In light of Waco and Ruby Ridge...

121
00:21:45,828 --> 00:21:50,533
...there is a need at the Attorney General's
office to place responsibility...

122
00:21:50,621 --> 00:21:56,656
...for the catastrophic destruction of public
property and loss of life due to terrorism.

123
00:21:56,749 --> 00:22:01,375
Details are unclear, but we're under
pressure from the Attorney General...

124
00:22:01,461 --> 00:22:06,038
...to give a true account of what happened,
so she can issue a public statement.

125
00:22:06,131 --> 00:22:10,707
We know now that five people
died in the explosion:

126
00:22:10,842 --> 00:22:12,004
Special...

127
00:22:15,762 --> 00:22:20,755
Special Agent in Charge Darius Michaud
who was trying to defuse the bomb...

128
00:22:20,849 --> 00:22:23,515
...three firemen from Dallas, and a young boy.

129
00:22:25,058 --> 00:22:29,848
Excuse me? The firemen and the young boy
were found in the building?

130
00:22:29,936 --> 00:22:35,439
Agent Mulder, since you weren't on time
for this hearing, please step outside...

131
00:22:35,523 --> 00:22:40,266
...so that we can hear
Agent Scully's version of the facts.

132
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:46,858
- We were told the building was clear.
- You'll get your turn. Please step outside.

133
00:23:06,874 --> 00:23:10,207
They're still talking to Agent Scully.

134
00:23:10,502 --> 00:23:12,043
About what?

135
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:16,373
They want to know why
she was in the wrong building.

136
00:23:16,505 --> 00:23:18,581
She was with me.

137
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:27,088
You don't get it, do you? There's $45 million
worth of damage to the city of Dallas.

138
00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:30,215
Lives have been lost.
No suspects have been named.

139
00:23:30,306 --> 00:23:33,886
The story is that
this could've been prevented.

140
00:23:33,973 --> 00:23:36,095
They wanna blame us?

141
00:23:38,184 --> 00:23:42,512
We both know that if it looks bad,
it's bad for the FBI.

142
00:23:42,605 --> 00:23:45,272
Blame has to be assigned somewhere.

143
00:23:46,481 --> 00:23:52,398
- But Agent Scully doesn't deserve this.
- She's saying the same about you.

144
00:23:52,485 --> 00:23:58,486
I breached protocol. I broke contact with
the SAC. I left him alone with the device.

145
00:23:58,572 --> 00:24:01,691
Agent Scully says you wanted to go back.

146
00:24:01,783 --> 00:24:03,028
No.

147
00:24:10,828 --> 00:24:13,318
They're asking for you, sir.

148
00:24:14,497 --> 00:24:15,990
Thank you.

149
00:24:19,584 --> 00:24:24,291
- You don't have to protect me.
- I told them the truth.

150
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:26,833
They're trying to divide us.

151
00:24:27,923 --> 00:24:31,290
They have divided us. They're splitting us up.

152
00:24:31,382 --> 00:24:33,755
What are you talking about?

153
00:24:33,844 --> 00:24:37,543
I meet with OPR in two days
for reassignment.

154
00:24:37,638 --> 00:24:39,048
They put us together!

155
00:24:39,138 --> 00:24:43,464
So I could invalidate your investigations
into the paranormal. But...

156
00:24:43,556 --> 00:24:45,880
...I think this goes deeper than that now.

157
00:24:45,973 --> 00:24:50,135
- They're doing this to me.
- They're not doing this.

158
00:24:53,813 --> 00:24:59,848
I left behind a career in medicine because
I thought I could make a difference at the FBI.

159
00:24:59,941 --> 00:25:02,776
But it hasn't turned out that way.

160
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:08,694
And now ifthey transfer me to Omaha
or Cleveland or some field office...

161
00:25:08,781 --> 00:25:15,908
...it doesn't hold the interest for me that it
once did. Not after what I've seen and done.

162
00:25:17,993 --> 00:25:19,783
You're quitting.

163
00:25:21,954 --> 00:25:26,032
Maybe you should ask yourself
if your heart's still in it, too.

164
00:25:30,876 --> 00:25:33,710
Agent Mulder, you're up.

165
00:25:33,795 --> 00:25:35,869
I'm sorry.

166
00:25:38,798 --> 00:25:39,876
Mulder...

167
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:45,752
Good luck.

168
00:26:08,023 --> 00:26:13,810
I'd say this about exceeds
your minimum daily requirement.

169
00:26:16,445 --> 00:26:21,320
Whoa! You've gotta train
for that kind of heavy lifting.

170
00:26:22,324 --> 00:26:24,399
Poopy day?

171
00:26:29,618 --> 00:26:31,028
So...

172
00:26:31,118 --> 00:26:32,910
...what do you do?

173
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:35,953
- What do I do?
- Mm-hm.

174
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:46,117
I'm the key figure in a government plot
to deny the existence of extraterrestrials.

175
00:26:46,213 --> 00:26:51,501
It's a global conspiracy with key players
in the highest levels of power.

176
00:26:51,591 --> 00:26:56,382
And it reaches down into the lives of every
man, woman and child on this planet.

177
00:26:58,304 --> 00:27:01,302
So, of course, no-one believes me.

178
00:27:01,387 --> 00:27:05,797
I'm an annoyance to my superiors,
a joke to my peers. They call me Spooky.

179
00:27:05,973 --> 00:27:09,257
Spooky Mulder,
whose sister was abducted by aliens...

180
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:12,968
...who chases after little green men
with a badge and a gun...

181
00:27:13,061 --> 00:27:16,264
...shouting to the heavens
to anyone who will listen...

182
00:27:16,355 --> 00:27:18,512
...that the sky is falling.

183
00:27:18,606 --> 00:27:23,147
And when it hits,
it's gonna be the shitstorm of all time.

184
00:27:26,403 --> 00:27:27,862
Well...

185
00:27:29,488 --> 00:27:33,271
- I would say that about does it, Spooky.
- Does what?

186
00:27:33,366 --> 00:27:36,234
Looks like 86 is your lucky number.

187
00:27:45,748 --> 00:27:49,410
You know, one is the Ioneliest number.

188
00:28:23,061 --> 00:28:24,009
Hello?

189
00:28:24,103 --> 00:28:26,179
- Whoa!
- Sorry.

190
00:28:44,699 --> 00:28:46,606
That official FBI business?

191
00:28:47,908 --> 00:28:49,070
What?

192
00:28:49,158 --> 00:28:52,692
Bet the Bureau's accusing you
of the same thing in Dallas.

193
00:28:52,786 --> 00:28:57,245
Standing around holding your yank
while bombs are exploding.

194
00:29:01,459 --> 00:29:03,450
Do I know you?

195
00:29:03,543 --> 00:29:07,076
No, but I've been watching your career
for a good while.

196
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:11,036
Back when you were
a promising young agent. Before that.

197
00:29:12,299 --> 00:29:15,383
- You come out here for a reason?
- Yeah...

198
00:29:15,468 --> 00:29:17,543
I did.

199
00:29:19,011 --> 00:29:21,250
My name is Kurtzweil.

200
00:29:21,344 --> 00:29:23,466
Dr Alvin Kurtzweil.

201
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:28,012
- Am I supposed to know that name?
- Old friend ofyour father's.

202
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:32,009
At the State Department
we were fellow travellers.

203
00:29:32,101 --> 00:29:36,180
But his disenchantment outlasted mine.

204
00:29:45,735 --> 00:29:47,810
How'd you find me?

205
00:29:48,445 --> 00:29:52,441
I heard you come in here.
I figured you'd need a drink tonight.

206
00:29:52,531 --> 00:29:57,236
- You a reporter?
- A doctor, which I mentioned. OB-GYN.

207
00:29:57,323 --> 00:29:59,731
You got something to tell me, say it.

208
00:29:59,825 --> 00:30:03,275
There's something you don't know
about the bombing in Dallas.

209
00:30:03,369 --> 00:30:04,650
What's that?

210
00:30:04,746 --> 00:30:08,990
SAC Darius Michaud never tried
or intended to defuse that bomb.

211
00:30:09,081 --> 00:30:11,867
He just let it explode in his face, huh?

212
00:30:11,958 --> 00:30:16,085
What is no-one asking? Why that building?
Why not the Federal Building?

213
00:30:16,169 --> 00:30:18,374
It was too well guarded.

214
00:30:18,462 --> 00:30:20,953
They bombed the other building...

215
00:30:21,048 --> 00:30:24,082
...because it did have Federal officers there.

216
00:30:24,174 --> 00:30:26,925
The Federal Emergency
Management Agency...

217
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:30,458
...had a quarantine office there,
where the bodies were found.

218
00:30:30,552 --> 00:30:34,548
That's the thing you didn't know.
The thing you'd never think to check.

219
00:30:34,638 --> 00:30:37,209
Those people were already dead.

220
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:41,216
Before the bomb went off?

221
00:30:41,309 --> 00:30:43,135
That's what I'm saying.

222
00:30:45,561 --> 00:30:47,849
Darius Michaud was a 22-year veteran...

223
00:30:47,937 --> 00:30:52,811
Michaud was a patriot. The people he was
loyal to know their way around Dallas.

224
00:30:52,899 --> 00:30:57,441
They blew that building to hide something.
Something they couldn't predict.

225
00:30:57,527 --> 00:31:01,440
They blew up a building
just to hide the bodies of those firemen?

226
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:03,486
And one little boy.

227
00:31:04,739 --> 00:31:06,813
I think you're full of shit.

228
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:10,148
Do you?

229
00:31:14,662 --> 00:31:17,282
Arlington, please.

230
00:31:31,548 --> 00:31:34,382
Actually, no, let's go to Georgetown.

231
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:38,040
Let's go to Georgetown.

232
00:32:05,985 --> 00:32:08,771
- I woke you. Did I wake you?
- No.

233
00:32:08,862 --> 00:32:10,734
Why not? It's 3am.

234
00:32:10,821 --> 00:32:12,895
Are you drunk?

235
00:32:14,071 --> 00:32:17,189
L-I was until about 20 minutes ago, yeah.

236
00:32:17,281 --> 00:32:20,731
Was that before or after
you decided to come here?

237
00:32:20,825 --> 00:32:22,568
What are you implying?

238
00:32:24,078 --> 00:32:26,449
- Go home, Mulder.
- No, get dressed.

239
00:32:26,537 --> 00:32:29,075
- It's late.
- Get dressed.

240
00:32:29,164 --> 00:32:33,623
- What are you doing?
- Get dressed and I'll explain on the way.

241
00:34:22,898 --> 00:34:25,056
Got something to show me?

242
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,895
We brought the atmosphere back down
to freezing, to control the development...

243
00:34:36,988 --> 00:34:40,023
...which is like nothing we've ever seen.

244
00:34:40,115 --> 00:34:43,235
- Brought on by what?
- Heat, I think.

245
00:34:43,326 --> 00:34:45,863
The coincident invasion of a host...

246
00:34:45,952 --> 00:34:48,158
...the fireman...

247
00:34:48,246 --> 00:34:53,867
...and an environment that raised
his body temperature above 98.6.

248
00:35:02,714 --> 00:35:04,789
This man's still alive.

249
00:35:04,881 --> 00:35:07,666
Technically... and biologically.

250
00:35:07,756 --> 00:35:10,080
But... he'll never recover.

251
00:35:13,968 --> 00:35:15,426
How can this be?

252
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:21,629
The developing organism is using
his life energy, digesting bone and tissue.

253
00:35:22,683 --> 00:35:25,386
We've just... slowed the process.

254
00:35:27,978 --> 00:35:31,475
Shall we destroy this one, too?
Before it gestates?

255
00:35:31,562 --> 00:35:34,232
Uh, no. No.

256
00:35:34,315 --> 00:35:37,648
We need to try our vaccine on it.

257
00:35:37,734 --> 00:35:40,058
And if it's unsuccessful?

258
00:35:40,152 --> 00:35:43,565
Burn it. Like the others.

259
00:36:06,876 --> 00:36:10,290
- ID and floor you're visiting.
- The morgue.

260
00:36:11,713 --> 00:36:14,202
That area's currently off limits.

261
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:16,620
- On whose orders?
- General McAddie.

262
00:36:16,714 --> 00:36:20,923
We were woken at 3am and told
to get down here immediately.

263
00:36:21,007 --> 00:36:22,964
I don't know about that.

264
00:36:23,051 --> 00:36:25,885
- Call General McAddie.
- I don't have the number.

265
00:36:25,969 --> 00:36:27,464
Call the switchboard.

266
00:36:30,472 --> 00:36:32,132
You don't know their number?

267
00:36:32,224 --> 00:36:37,299
- I'll call my CO.
- We don't have time for you to dick around.

268
00:36:37,393 --> 00:36:40,097
Our order came from McAddie. Call him.

269
00:36:40,186 --> 00:36:44,764
We'll conduct our business
while you confirm authorisation.

270
00:36:46,567 --> 00:36:50,432
Why don't you head on down,
and I'll confirm authorisation.

271
00:36:50,527 --> 00:36:52,232
Thank you.

272
00:36:52,318 --> 00:36:56,777
Why is the morgue suddenly off limits
on the orders of the general?

273
00:36:56,904 --> 00:37:00,651
This is one of the firemen
who died in Dallas?

274
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:02,697
According to the toe tag.

275
00:37:02,783 --> 00:37:06,447
- And you're looking for...?
- Cause of death.

276
00:37:06,536 --> 00:37:10,152
I can tell you that
without even looking at him.

277
00:37:10,245 --> 00:37:15,486
"Concussive organ failure due to
exposure to source and flying debris."

278
00:37:15,582 --> 00:37:18,998
Mulder, this man's already been autopsied.

279
00:37:22,963 --> 00:37:26,578
Does this fit the description
you just read me?

280
00:37:31,341 --> 00:37:35,005
- Oh, my God! This man's tissue...
- It's like jelly.

281
00:37:37,595 --> 00:37:42,006
There's been some kind
of cellular breakdown.

282
00:37:46,017 --> 00:37:48,933
God, it's completely oedematous!

283
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:55,062
There's been no autopsy performed.
No Y-incision...

284
00:37:55,941 --> 00:37:57,683
...no internal exam.

285
00:37:57,775 --> 00:38:01,437
So the cause of death on that report is false?

286
00:38:01,525 --> 00:38:04,394
This man didn't die from an explosion?

287
00:38:04,485 --> 00:38:10,070
I can't tell you what killed this man.
I'm not sure anybody else could, either.

288
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:20,321
Mulder, you knew this man
didn't die at the bomb site.

289
00:38:20,412 --> 00:38:24,159
- I'd been told as much.
- You're saying this is a cover-up?

290
00:38:24,247 --> 00:38:25,706
Of what?

291
00:38:25,791 --> 00:38:30,367
I don't know. But I've a hunch it won't be
anything that can be categorised.

292
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:37,170
Mulder, this is gonna take time. Somebody
is gonna figure out we shouldn't be here.

293
00:38:37,254 --> 00:38:42,495
We are being blamed for this man's death.
I want to know what he died of. Don't you?

294
00:38:58,809 --> 00:39:01,597
That's it, up here.

295
00:39:21,948 --> 00:39:26,241
- Excuse me? Can I help you?
- Is this Dr Kurtzweil's residence?

296
00:39:28,285 --> 00:39:32,661
- You have business with him?
- Yeah, I'm looking for him.

297
00:39:32,746 --> 00:39:34,903
Looking for him for what?

298
00:39:36,625 --> 00:39:41,332
The Feds are lookin' for him, too.
Nice business he's got, huh?

299
00:39:41,419 --> 00:39:43,411
What's that?

300
00:39:43,503 --> 00:39:47,663
Selling naked pictures of little kids
on his computer.

301
00:39:52,298 --> 00:39:56,165
You looking for him
for some other reason?

302
00:39:56,344 --> 00:40:00,422
Yeah. I had an appointment
for a pelvic examination.

303
00:40:07,058 --> 00:40:11,221
- You want a call ifwe find this Kurtzweil?
- Don't bother.

304
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:37,073
See this crap?
Somebody knows I'm talking to you.

305
00:40:37,159 --> 00:40:39,483
Not according to the men in blue.

306
00:40:39,578 --> 00:40:43,075
Is it kiddie porn again?
Sexual battery of a patient?

307
00:40:43,162 --> 00:40:47,740
- They wanna discredit you. Why?
- Because I know too much about the truth.

308
00:40:47,833 --> 00:40:50,868
That end-of-the-world garbage you write?

309
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,786
You know my work?

310
00:40:54,961 --> 00:40:57,415
- I was right about Dallas.
- How?

311
00:40:57,503 --> 00:41:00,076
Do you know of the Hanta virus?

312
00:41:00,172 --> 00:41:06,209
Yeah. A deadly virus spread by field mice
several years ago.

313
00:41:06,301 --> 00:41:10,712
The newspaper says FEMA was called out
to manage an outbreak.

314
00:41:10,804 --> 00:41:16,472
Do you know what the Federal Emergency
Management Agency's real power is?

315
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:22,013
It can suspend constitutional government
upon declaration of a national emergency.

316
00:41:22,103 --> 00:41:24,141
Think about that.

317
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:30,974
What is such a powerful agency doing
managing a small viral outbreak in Texas?

318
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:36,858
- You saying it wasn't a small outbreak?
- No. I'm saying it wasn't the Hanta virus.

319
00:41:36,943 --> 00:41:38,687
Well, what was it?

320
00:41:44,532 --> 00:41:46,607
What was it?

321
00:41:48,868 --> 00:41:54,620
Years ago, your father and I were recruited
for a project. Biological warfare. A virus.

322
00:41:54,705 --> 00:41:56,614
What killed those men?

323
00:41:56,707 --> 00:42:01,699
Something lwon't even write about.
We have no context for what it is.

324
00:42:01,793 --> 00:42:05,834
Or any appreciation of the scale
at which it will be unleashed.

325
00:42:05,919 --> 00:42:07,994
A plague?

326
00:42:09,463 --> 00:42:11,620
The plague to end all plagues.

327
00:42:11,714 --> 00:42:14,419
A silent weapon for a quiet war.

328
00:42:14,508 --> 00:42:20,260
The systematic release of an indiscriminate
organism for which there is no cure.

329
00:42:20,345 --> 00:42:23,546
They've been working on this for 50 years.

330
00:42:23,638 --> 00:42:29,924
While the rest of the world fought Commies,
these men were negotiating an Armageddon.

331
00:42:30,018 --> 00:42:32,342
Negotiating with whom?

332
00:42:32,436 --> 00:42:34,594
I think you know.

333
00:42:34,688 --> 00:42:40,686
The timetable has been set. It'll happen
on a holiday when people are travelling.

334
00:42:40,773 --> 00:42:46,227
A state of emergency will be declared.
Government will come under the power...

335
00:42:46,317 --> 00:42:49,484
...of the Federal Emergency
Management Agency.

336
00:42:50,363 --> 00:42:53,896
FEMA. The secret government.

337
00:42:55,407 --> 00:42:57,482
They call me paranoid!

338
00:42:57,575 --> 00:43:01,192
Go back to Dallas, Agent Mulder, and dig.

339
00:43:02,203 --> 00:43:07,113
Or we'll find out along with the rest
of the country... when it's too late.

340
00:43:59,752 --> 00:44:01,543
Scully, it's me.

341
00:44:02,295 --> 00:44:04,832
- Yeah.
- Whyare you whispering?

342
00:44:04,922 --> 00:44:06,748
I can't talk right now.

343
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:11,334
- What did you find?
- Evidence of a massive infection.

344
00:44:11,426 --> 00:44:14,925
- What kind of infection?
- I don'tknow.

345
00:44:16,263 --> 00:44:19,346
I'm gonna book a flight to Dallas.

346
00:44:19,432 --> 00:44:21,222
I'll getyou a ticket, too.

347
00:44:21,307 --> 00:44:23,843
- Mulder...
- I need your expertise.

348
00:44:23,932 --> 00:44:27,714
- It's my hearing tomorrow.
- I'll get you back in time.

349
00:44:27,810 --> 00:44:29,967
Maybe with new evidence.

350
00:44:30,061 --> 00:44:33,430
I can't!
I'm past the point of common sense here.

351
00:44:33,522 --> 00:44:37,565
It's not common sense. It's...

352
00:44:38,234 --> 00:44:41,601
Are you there? Scul...

353
00:44:41,693 --> 00:44:43,769
Scully?

354
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:18,500
You're looking for a needle in a haystack.

355
00:45:18,591 --> 00:45:22,587
There was so much devastation,
we haven't put much together yet.

356
00:45:22,676 --> 00:45:27,087
I'm looking for anything unusual.
Maybe something from the FEMA offices...

357
00:45:27,179 --> 00:45:31,923
...where the bodies were found.
- We sent those remains off to Washington.

358
00:45:32,015 --> 00:45:35,595
Anything that you haven't sent off yet?

359
00:45:35,682 --> 00:45:42,134
Some bone fragments FEMA recovered
from an archaeological site outta town.

360
00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:45,597
- Have you examined them?
- No. They're just fossils.

361
00:45:48,566 --> 00:45:52,230
I'd like you to let this person
take a look at them.

362
00:45:55,528 --> 00:45:57,770
Just let me get them.

363
00:46:01,533 --> 00:46:04,983
- You said you weren't coming.
- I wasn't planning to.

364
00:46:05,077 --> 00:46:10,612
But I got a better look at the samples
I took from the fireman.

365
00:46:10,703 --> 00:46:12,446
And what did you find?

366
00:46:12,538 --> 00:46:17,413
Something I couldn't show to anybody else
without causing attention.

367
00:46:19,543 --> 00:46:26,076
But what those men were infected with
contains a protein coat I've never seen before.

368
00:46:26,171 --> 00:46:27,879
What it did to them, it did very fast.

369
00:46:27,965 --> 00:46:31,083
- How was it contracted?
- I don't know.

370
00:46:31,174 --> 00:46:35,421
But it could be a serious health threat.

371
00:46:37,138 --> 00:46:42,175
These fossils weren't near the blast centre
so they won't tell you much.

372
00:46:42,264 --> 00:46:45,382
Right. Why don't you check this out?

373
00:47:05,319 --> 00:47:10,276
- Where were these found?
- I'll show you right on the map.

374
00:47:45,636 --> 00:47:48,755
I want all of these settings checked.

375
00:47:48,846 --> 00:47:54,465
I want a steady minus two degrees Celsius
throughout the transfer of the body...

376
00:47:54,556 --> 00:47:56,963
...after I've administered the vaccine.

377
00:48:32,870 --> 00:48:34,910
- It's gone!
- It's what?

378
00:48:34,997 --> 00:48:38,447
It's left the body. I think it's gestated.

379
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:43,665
- What's the matter?
- Wait.

380
00:48:45,378 --> 00:48:46,872
I can see it.

381
00:48:55,177 --> 00:48:56,422
Oh...

382
00:48:56,511 --> 00:48:58,799
Jesus, Lord...

383
00:49:01,096 --> 00:49:03,466
- You see it?
- Yeah.

384
00:49:03,555 --> 00:49:06,010
So much for little green men!

385
00:49:08,099 --> 00:49:11,550
I need you down here.

386
00:50:14,346 --> 00:50:16,837
Help... I need help.

387
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:25,345
What are you doing?

388
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:28,308
What are you doing!

389
00:50:35,861 --> 00:50:38,529
Oh, my God!

390
00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:08,745
Sir, you have a call.

391
00:51:21,261 --> 00:51:22,340
Yes?

392
00:51:22,428 --> 00:51:25,926
We have a situation.
The members are assembling.

393
00:51:26,014 --> 00:51:27,258
Is it an emergency?

394
00:51:27,348 --> 00:51:32,424
Yes. A meeting has been set,
tonight in London.

395
00:51:32,518 --> 00:51:34,309
Who called it?

396
00:51:34,394 --> 00:51:38,473
Strughold. He just got on a plane in Tunis.

397
00:52:10,499 --> 00:52:14,827
- Has Strughold arrived?
- Yes. They're in the library, sir.

398
00:52:26,718 --> 00:52:32,052
We were worried. Some of us have travelled
so far, and you are the last to arrive.

399
00:52:32,136 --> 00:52:35,551
I'm sorry. My grandson broke his leg.

400
00:52:35,638 --> 00:52:43,050
While we've been waiting, we've seen
surveillance tapes that raise more concerns.

401
00:52:43,143 --> 00:52:45,550
More concerns than what?

402
00:52:45,645 --> 00:52:49,855
We have been forced to reassess
our role in colonisation...

403
00:52:49,939 --> 00:52:54,481
...by recently presented facts of biology.

404
00:52:54,567 --> 00:52:56,358
The virus has mutated.

405
00:52:56,444 --> 00:52:58,482
Into what?

406
00:52:58,570 --> 00:53:02,518
A new extraterrestrial biological entity.

407
00:53:03,947 --> 00:53:05,985
My God...

408
00:53:06,073 --> 00:53:11,527
The geometry of mass infection means
we must re-evaluate their colonisation.

409
00:53:11,617 --> 00:53:17,037
This isn't colonisation.
This is spontaneous repopulation.

410
00:53:18,623 --> 00:53:20,282
All our work...

411
00:53:20,374 --> 00:53:25,532
If it's true, they've been using us all along.
We've been labouring under a lie.

412
00:53:25,627 --> 00:53:29,670
- It could be an isolated case.
- How can we know?

413
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:33,752
We're going to tell them
what we've learned...

414
00:53:33,841 --> 00:53:38,299
...by turning over a body
infected with the gestating organism.

415
00:53:38,385 --> 00:53:42,331
In hope of what?
Learning that it's true?

416
00:53:42,427 --> 00:53:47,171
That we are nothing but digestives
for the creation of a new race of aliens?

417
00:53:47,264 --> 00:53:50,430
By co-operating
we hasten our own demise.

418
00:53:50,516 --> 00:53:53,931
It's the only chance of saving ourselves.

419
00:53:54,019 --> 00:53:57,220
They still need us to make their preparations.

420
00:53:57,312 --> 00:54:02,730
We'll continue to use them as they do us,
if only to get more time to work...

421
00:54:02,815 --> 00:54:04,607
...on our vaccine.

422
00:54:04,693 --> 00:54:10,811
My lateness might as well have been
absence. A course has already been taken.

423
00:54:10,904 --> 00:54:13,145
There are complications.

424
00:54:13,238 --> 00:54:17,564
Mulder saw one of the infected bodies
we destroyed in Dallas.

425
00:54:17,656 --> 00:54:20,277
He's there now. Someone tipped him.

426
00:54:20,366 --> 00:54:21,397
Who?

427
00:54:23,369 --> 00:54:28,409
- Kurtzweil, we think.
- No-one believes Kurtzweil. Or his books.

428
00:54:28,497 --> 00:54:30,405
He's a crank.

429
00:54:30,498 --> 00:54:32,157
Mulder believes him.

430
00:54:32,249 --> 00:54:37,075
- Then Kurtzweil must be removed.
- As must Mulder.

431
00:54:37,168 --> 00:54:43,123
Kill Mulder... we take the risk
of turning one man's quest into a crusade.

432
00:54:43,215 --> 00:54:46,499
Then take away
what he holds most valuable.

433
00:54:46,592 --> 00:54:49,922
That with which he can't live without.

434
00:54:54,053 --> 00:54:59,390
I don't see any evidence of an archaeological
or any other kind of a dig site.

435
00:54:59,474 --> 00:55:02,307
This is where he marked on the map.

436
00:55:02,392 --> 00:55:07,632
You're sure those fossils were infected
with the same virus you saw at the morgue?

437
00:55:07,728 --> 00:55:13,148
Both sets of bones were porous.
As ifthe virus were decomposing it.

438
00:55:13,232 --> 00:55:16,019
- And you've never seen that virus before?
- No.

439
00:55:19,153 --> 00:55:21,228
Look at that.

440
00:55:34,328 --> 00:55:39,035
- That look like new grass to you?
- Pretty green for this climate.

441
00:55:43,708 --> 00:55:47,455
Ground's dry about an inch down.
This was laid recently.

442
00:55:47,544 --> 00:55:49,536
The equipment's brand-new, too.

443
00:55:49,629 --> 00:55:53,756
No irrigation system.
Somebody's covering their tracks.

444
00:56:01,175 --> 00:56:02,254
Hey!

445
00:56:03,636 --> 00:56:04,714
Hey!

446
00:56:05,845 --> 00:56:08,217
You boys live around here?

447
00:56:08,306 --> 00:56:09,337
Yeah.

448
00:56:09,431 --> 00:56:11,672
Seen anybody digging over there?

449
00:56:11,766 --> 00:56:14,054
We're not supposed to say.

450
00:56:14,143 --> 00:56:17,058
- Who told you that?
- Nobody.

451
00:56:17,144 --> 00:56:20,428
Same nobody that built that playground?

452
00:56:20,521 --> 00:56:24,518
Nobody buy you those new bikes, too?

453
00:56:24,608 --> 00:56:27,940
- You'd better tell us.
- We don't even know you.

454
00:56:28,027 --> 00:56:29,520
We're FBI agents.

455
00:56:29,611 --> 00:56:31,353
You're not FBI agents.

456
00:56:31,445 --> 00:56:35,902
- How do you know?
- Cos y'all look like door-to-door salesmen.

457
00:56:39,948 --> 00:56:42,238
Hey, you wanna buy a badge?

458
00:56:43,327 --> 00:56:45,283
They left an hour ago.

459
00:56:45,369 --> 00:56:47,492
Going that way.

460
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:03,161
Unmarked tanker trucks.

461
00:57:03,256 --> 00:57:06,539
What do archaeologists
haul out in tanker trucks?

462
00:57:06,632 --> 00:57:09,417
- I don't know.
- Where are they going with it?

463
00:57:09,507 --> 00:57:13,171
That's the first question to answer
if we're gonna find them.

464
00:57:22,933 --> 00:57:24,426
What are my choices?

465
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:29,177
- 100 miles of nothing in both directions.
- Which way do you think they went?

466
00:57:29,312 --> 00:57:31,552
You got two choices. One's wrong.

467
00:57:35,566 --> 00:57:38,602
- I think they went left.
- I think they went right.

468
00:57:56,453 --> 00:58:00,744
Five years together.
How many times have I been wrong?

469
00:58:00,830 --> 00:58:02,906
Never.

470
00:58:03,582 --> 00:58:05,324
Not driving, anyway.

471
00:58:50,985 --> 00:58:54,683
- I was right about the bomb, wasn't I?
- This is great. This is fitting.

472
00:58:54,777 --> 00:58:57,268
What?

473
00:58:57,363 --> 00:59:04,442
I have to be in Washington DC in 11 hours
for a hearing concerning my career.

474
00:59:04,534 --> 00:59:09,490
And I'm in the middle of nowhere,
chasing phantom tanker trucks.

475
00:59:09,579 --> 00:59:11,655
We're chasing evidence.

476
00:59:11,747 --> 00:59:12,945
Of what?

477
00:59:13,039 --> 00:59:18,080
That bomb went off to hide something:
Bodies infected with a virus you detected.

478
00:59:18,168 --> 00:59:23,587
They haul oil in tanker trucks. They haul gas
in tanker trucks. They do not haul viruses.

479
00:59:23,672 --> 00:59:27,582
Well, they may be hauling a virus
in these tanker trucks.

480
00:59:27,672 --> 00:59:29,747
What do you mean? Mulder?

481
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:32,247
What are you not telling me?

482
00:59:33,550 --> 00:59:35,876
Mulder!

483
00:59:37,804 --> 00:59:40,340
The virus may be extraterrestrial.

484
00:59:44,558 --> 00:59:46,965
I don't...

485
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:49,596
Mulder, I don't...

486
01:01:17,028 --> 01:01:20,776
- What do you think they are?
- I have no idea.

487
01:02:03,139 --> 01:02:04,799
This is weird, Mulder.

488
01:02:05,474 --> 01:02:06,849
Very weird.

489
01:02:06,933 --> 01:02:10,883
Why would anyone grow corn
in the middle of the desert?

490
01:02:10,979 --> 01:02:14,392
Those could be giant Jiffy Pop poppers.

491
01:03:25,397 --> 01:03:27,768
It's cool in here.

492
01:03:28,023 --> 01:03:30,856
The temperature's being regulated.

493
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:33,015
For the purpose of what?

494
01:03:33,108 --> 01:03:38,101
I think we're on top of a larger structure.
This is some kind of a venting system.

495
01:03:38,195 --> 01:03:40,234
Do you hear something?

496
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:49,319
I hear a humming,...

497
01:03:50,319 --> 01:04:00,319
