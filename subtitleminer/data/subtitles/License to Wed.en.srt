00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,271
Hey.

2
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:39,046
Bye!

3
00:00:41,725 --> 00:00:44,057
Bouquet? Bouquet.

4
00:00:44,227 --> 00:00:45,216
Beautiful, isn't it?

5
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:48,290
But let me tell you the truth.

6
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:53,167
For a lot of people, marriage is like
sticking your tongue on a frozen flagpole.

7
00:00:53,336 --> 00:00:56,100
It looks like fun when you see
friends doing it, so you say:

8
00:00:56,272 --> 00:00:59,139
"Hey, I'll give it a try.
Just once."

9
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:02,540
Next thing you know, you're stuck.

10
00:01:02,712 --> 00:01:04,179
Full of regret.

11
00:01:04,347 --> 00:01:06,838
Praying, "Please get me
out of this with my dignity...

12
00:01:07,016 --> 00:01:09,985
...if least not my extremities, intact."

13
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:12,348
But it doesn't have to be
like that, my friends.

14
00:01:12,522 --> 00:01:15,650
It does not have to be like that.

15
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:17,383
That's where I come in.

16
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,028
Good marriages are my business.

17
00:01:20,396 --> 00:01:22,387
<i>Meeting the right person</i>
<i>in the first place?</i>

18
00:01:22,564 --> 00:01:25,329
<i>Well, my friends, 
that is up to you.</i>

19
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:26,969
Oh, I'm sorry.

20
00:01:27,137 --> 00:01:30,265
- I'll go.
- Yeah, you go. Okay.

21
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:49,214
- Hi. I'm Sadie.
- Hi. Ben.

22
00:01:49,392 --> 00:01:51,622
<i>From that first, destined meeting...</i>

23
00:01:52,162 --> 00:01:55,188
<i>... to the sweet innocence</i>
<i>of the first date.</i>

24
00:02:00,136 --> 00:02:02,468
- Are you skipping to second base?
- What's that? No.

25
00:02:02,639 --> 00:02:04,368
You know why? I'm not a skipper.

26
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:09,478
Maybe we should take care of first base,
just to make things right.

27
00:02:12,148 --> 00:02:14,241
<i>The first kiss.</i>

28
00:02:14,918 --> 00:02:17,386
<i>The first time you say "I love you."</i>

29
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,283
- I love you.
- What?

30
00:02:19,455 --> 00:02:22,083
What? A view.
What a view.

31
00:02:22,258 --> 00:02:25,819
<i>First time you say "I love you,"</i>
<i>and she actually hears you.</i>

32
00:02:25,995 --> 00:02:27,485
I love you.

33
00:02:29,098 --> 00:02:32,226
- I'm afraid you're not my type.
- I love you too.

34
00:02:39,008 --> 00:02:41,568
You seriously didn't think I was
gonna let you see that?

35
00:02:42,445 --> 00:02:45,107
<i>Let's skip to the next thing:</i>
<i>moving in together.</i>

36
00:02:45,281 --> 00:02:49,240
<i>The first time she finds something</i>
<i>you don't want her to see.</i>

37
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,551
- Don't worry, I got the heavy ones.
- "Dear Mr. Brian Boitano."

38
00:02:53,723 --> 00:02:56,453
- Oh, God!
- "Congratulations on your triple Axel.

39
00:02:56,993 --> 00:02:58,984
I wonder how much
you practice every week...

40
00:02:59,162 --> 00:03:02,996
...and also how you make your hair
stay like that."

41
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:05,600
Hey, he was a legend. Okay?

42
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:08,601
I mean, even at age 9 I knew that.

43
00:03:09,005 --> 00:03:11,838
I'm gonna get a less embarrassing box.
Okay.

44
00:03:12,008 --> 00:03:14,442
<i>If she doesn't dump your</i>
<i>wussy ass after that...</i>

45
00:03:15,645 --> 00:03:18,205
...then comes the big one: the proposal.

46
00:03:29,058 --> 00:03:30,218
Sadie...

47
00:03:30,393 --> 00:03:31,985
...you're a great girl. You are.

48
00:03:32,161 --> 00:03:34,527
And I think it's time that
you and I were man and...

49
00:03:34,697 --> 00:03:36,688
Lame. That is so lame.

50
00:03:40,837 --> 00:03:44,204
We are so pleased all of you
could be here with us today...

51
00:03:44,374 --> 00:03:48,606
...to celebrate our 30 years of marriage.

52
00:03:48,778 --> 00:03:50,040
Cheers.

53
00:03:52,548 --> 00:03:53,537
Cheers.

54
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:58,382
It is especially gratifying to be
surrounded by such good friends...

55
00:03:58,554 --> 00:03:59,680
...and family...

56
00:04:00,056 --> 00:04:04,186
...and of course,
our two beautiful daughters...

57
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,657
...Sadie...

58
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:07,420
...and Lindsey...

59
00:04:07,597 --> 00:04:09,690
...who has moved back home with us...

60
00:04:11,301 --> 00:04:13,394
...to try and make a new start for herself.

61
00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:14,729
We are...

62
00:04:15,638 --> 00:04:18,664
...so thrilled with her perseverance.

63
00:04:19,876 --> 00:04:21,844
Thank you for the support, Dad.

64
00:04:24,314 --> 00:04:28,216
And then there's Carlisle, Sadie's best
friend, who used to take baths with Sadie...

65
00:04:28,384 --> 00:04:29,851
- What?
- What?

66
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:35,013
...when they were younger,
and pretend he was a submarine captain.

67
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:37,682
I destroyed all the photos.
I promise you.

68
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,852
- Thank you. 
Very good to know. Thanks.
- Wait, what?

69
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,089
And our good friends, 
Don and Gwen...

70
00:04:43,266 --> 00:04:45,131
...Kwan-Li...

71
00:04:45,301 --> 00:04:46,791
...Jerry, Otis.

72
00:04:47,136 --> 00:04:48,728
Dad...

73
00:04:49,272 --> 00:04:50,261
...what about...

74
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,271
- What about Ben?
- Oh, no, no, no.

75
00:04:53,242 --> 00:04:57,440
Oh, and of course, there's
Sadie's affable boyfriend, Ben.

76
00:04:58,514 --> 00:05:00,038
But what I really want to do...

77
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:02,616
...is thank my beautiful wife...

78
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:08,054
...without whom this life
would mean nothing.

79
00:05:08,257 --> 00:05:10,851
Happy 30th anniversary.

80
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:14,988
- I love you.
- I love you too.

81
00:05:15,164 --> 00:05:17,223
And I hope there are 30 more.

82
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,800
Well, that makes one of us.

83
00:05:28,544 --> 00:05:30,978
Excuse me.
Could I have everyone's attention, please?

84
00:05:32,715 --> 00:05:34,239
I just wanted to...

85
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:43,386
Well, I thought since
everyone was gathered...

86
00:05:43,559 --> 00:05:45,618
...gathered already...

87
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,130
Oh, my God.

88
00:05:51,567 --> 00:05:52,556
Oh, my God.

89
00:05:52,735 --> 00:05:54,669
- Sadie...
- Oh, my God, oh, my God.

90
00:05:54,837 --> 00:05:56,464
...Wilhelmina Jones.

91
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:03,177
In front of God and your family...

92
00:06:03,513 --> 00:06:09,281
...Kwan-Li, and Jerry and Otis and...

93
00:06:11,354 --> 00:06:13,549
I just want to know...

94
00:06:13,723 --> 00:06:16,692
...if you would spend the rest
of your life with me.

95
00:06:19,195 --> 00:06:20,253
But I don't...

96
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,625
I don't want to put you
on the spot or anything.

97
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:27,759
Benjamin Murphy, I would marry you
tomorrow in a potato-sack dress...

98
00:06:27,937 --> 00:06:32,340
...in the middle of a rainstorm, if it meant
I could spend the rest of my life with you.

99
00:06:37,914 --> 00:06:39,142
Wait a second.

100
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:46,418
You choose our 30th wedding anniversary
to propose to my daughter?

101
00:06:49,192 --> 00:06:50,659
Well...

102
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,060
...we couldn't be happier.

103
00:06:53,229 --> 00:06:55,356
Oh, my gosh.

104
00:06:55,531 --> 00:06:56,725
I know.

105
00:06:58,568 --> 00:07:00,536
New brother-in-law-to-be, I guess.

106
00:07:00,703 --> 00:07:02,830
- Oh, man. Hey, hello.
- Awkward.

107
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:04,870
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

108
00:07:06,776 --> 00:07:08,903
- Welcome to the family, Ben.
- Sir. All right!

109
00:07:09,078 --> 00:07:11,569
- Oh, my baby.
- Oh, honey, I'm so happy for you.

110
00:07:11,747 --> 00:07:13,806
Look at this beautiful ring.

111
00:07:13,983 --> 00:07:16,042
Sadie, Sadie, I was thinking...

112
00:07:16,452 --> 00:07:20,081
I think we should have the wedding
somewhere tropical. I was thinking, like...

113
00:07:20,256 --> 00:07:21,723
...the Caribbean.

114
00:07:21,891 --> 00:07:23,620
I have this one thing.

115
00:07:25,761 --> 00:07:27,251
Okay.

116
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:29,057
I always wanted
to get married here.

117
00:07:30,466 --> 00:07:33,299
Here.
What do you mean?

118
00:07:33,469 --> 00:07:34,697
At Saint Augustine's.

119
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:38,363
It's this fantasy I've had
since I was a little girl.

120
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,406
It's the church where
John and I married.

121
00:07:40,576 --> 00:07:43,841
Where Sadie was christened by
Reverend Frank, who's known us forever.

122
00:07:44,013 --> 00:07:47,210
More importantly, it's the church
Sadie's grandfather built.

123
00:07:48,484 --> 00:07:49,610
Her dead grandfather.

124
00:07:49,785 --> 00:07:53,721
Oh, give me a break.
All he built was a door after it was stolen.

125
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,983
How would you know?
You weren't married there.

126
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,286
And we all know
how that marriage turned out.

127
00:07:58,461 --> 00:07:59,928
Mom!

128
00:08:00,096 --> 00:08:02,724
- Stop.
- Here, here, here, here.

129
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:05,265
Babe, you've made me so
unbelievably happy today.

130
00:08:05,434 --> 00:08:06,423
You have no idea.

131
00:08:06,636 --> 00:08:08,001
- Great.
- Yeah.

132
00:08:08,171 --> 00:08:10,765
Then Saint Augustine's...

133
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,909
...is the decision.
- Thank you, I love you.

134
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:16,235
- You ready?
- I'm missing a shoe.

135
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:18,972
- Well, where did you last see it?
- I don't know.

136
00:08:19,148 --> 00:08:21,639
You know, Ben,
your sweater's actually inside out?

137
00:08:21,817 --> 00:08:23,808
Gotta fix that.

138
00:08:23,986 --> 00:08:25,317
What would you do without me?

139
00:08:25,488 --> 00:08:27,854
You want the short list or the long list?

140
00:08:28,024 --> 00:08:29,889
Oh, and your belt?

141
00:08:30,059 --> 00:08:32,118
- It's a little funny.
- No, my belt's fine.

142
00:08:34,063 --> 00:08:35,087
Wait a minute.

143
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:37,289
- We're gonna be really late.
- No, we're not.

144
00:08:37,466 --> 00:08:38,694
Yeah, we are.

145
00:08:38,868 --> 00:08:40,893
And your point is?

146
00:08:49,545 --> 00:08:50,773
How do I look?

147
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:53,575
- You look like you've just been...
- All right, never mind.

148
00:08:53,749 --> 00:08:55,580
We're so going to hell, you know that?

149
00:08:55,751 --> 00:08:59,517
- Hey, here's the door Grandpa built.
- Wow, he does really good work.

150
00:09:15,338 --> 00:09:17,169
Don't touch that!

151
00:09:17,506 --> 00:09:19,269
Jesus! You scared me.

152
00:09:19,709 --> 00:09:22,200
Jesus didn't scare you, I did.

153
00:09:23,112 --> 00:09:26,548
- Hi, I'm Sadie...
- Sadie Jones. Yes, I know.

154
00:09:26,716 --> 00:09:28,513
You have a 10:30 with Reverend Frank.

155
00:09:28,718 --> 00:09:30,015
Yeah. Is he here?

156
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,547
Reverend Frank is everywhere.

157
00:09:32,722 --> 00:09:34,383
Follow me.

158
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,724
"Dear <i>ELLE</i> magazine:

00:09:40,896 --> 00:09:43,387
I just found out that my husband
of three months...

160
00:09:43,566 --> 00:09:46,034
...is cheating on me with my best friend.

161
00:09:46,202 --> 00:09:50,104
Half of me wants to kill him, the other
half wants to salvage my marriage.

162
00:09:50,273 --> 00:09:51,331
What to do?"

163
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:52,496
Yikes.

164
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,939
What kind of sins are we
dealing with here, guys?

165
00:09:55,111 --> 00:09:57,443
- Sarah.
- Thou shall not commit adultery?

166
00:09:57,613 --> 00:10:00,707
Adultery. Going out for milk
when you have jugs at home.

167
00:10:00,883 --> 00:10:02,976
Show me adultery!

168
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,752
Not neat to cheat! Okay!

169
00:10:06,922 --> 00:10:08,480
Now, a lot of people ask me:

170
00:10:08,658 --> 00:10:11,456
"What if I'm cheating with a woman
who's really, really ugly?

171
00:10:11,627 --> 00:10:12,958
Does that make it all right?"

172
00:10:13,129 --> 00:10:15,893
No, it does not make it all right.
It is still a sin.

173
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,094
What other sins? Anybody?

174
00:10:18,267 --> 00:10:21,031
Don't hesitate to draw on
your parents' bad examples.

175
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:24,331
- Laurie. Bring it, girl.
- Thou shall not covet thy neighbor's wife.

176
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,873
Starts with coveting, ends with the clap.

177
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,978
Okay, coveting thy neighbor's wife.

178
00:10:30,146 --> 00:10:33,081
That's why God invented
the cold shower. Show me coveting!

179
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,375
Good one, Laurie!

180
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:40,818
Okay, there's one answer left on the board.
Let's see.

181
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:42,355
Manny.

182
00:10:44,627 --> 00:10:46,458
Make your two moms proud.

183
00:10:48,597 --> 00:10:51,691
Come on, Manny,
you can murder this one.

184
00:10:52,635 --> 00:10:56,662
While I'm waiting, maybe I'll just
fashion a shiv out of Cindy's barrette.

185
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:01,107
Take a stab at it.

186
00:11:03,512 --> 00:11:05,139
Thou shall not kill?

187
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:07,811
Boom, Manny!
Bang, bang, bang!

188
00:11:09,118 --> 00:11:10,915
Show me thou shall not kill!

189
00:11:12,488 --> 00:11:15,355
Oh, good one, Manny!
Manny, Manny, Manny.

190
00:11:15,524 --> 00:11:16,650
That's it for today.

191
00:11:16,826 --> 00:11:19,056
Next we're gonna take
a trip to Arlington Park.

192
00:11:19,228 --> 00:11:22,026
We're gonna find out about
the evils of gambling firsthand.

193
00:11:22,198 --> 00:11:23,825
So bring at least a dollar...

194
00:11:23,999 --> 00:11:27,332
...and remember to ask Mom and Dad
what a trifecta is.

195
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,568
I don't know if you remember me,
Reverend Frank, but...

196
00:11:33,743 --> 00:11:35,643
Sadie Jones?

197
00:11:35,811 --> 00:11:37,711
Little Sadie Jones.

198
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,575
- How you've grown.
- Well, yeah.

199
00:11:39,749 --> 00:11:42,183
And now my Sadie Jones
is gonna tie the knot.

200
00:11:42,351 --> 00:11:43,340
I am.

201
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,749
I'm sorry I haven't been around
for the last...

202
00:11:45,921 --> 00:11:46,910
Ten years.

203
00:11:47,089 --> 00:11:48,078
Yeah.

204
00:11:48,257 --> 00:11:50,191
I've just been trying to get
my business...

205
00:11:50,359 --> 00:11:51,690
Oh, please.

206
00:11:51,894 --> 00:11:54,158
You go to college,
you have a bisexual roommate...

207
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:56,161
...you forget about God.
Don't sweat it.

208
00:11:56,332 --> 00:11:57,629
He doesn't forget about you.

209
00:12:00,269 --> 00:12:01,759
Who are you?

210
00:12:02,605 --> 00:12:03,594
I'm Ben.

211
00:12:03,773 --> 00:12:04,762
- Ben.
- Hi.

212
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:07,636
So, what do you do,
besides little Sadie here?

213
00:12:10,346 --> 00:12:11,335
How are you?

214
00:12:11,781 --> 00:12:14,682
All right, let's get the flock out of here.
Come on.

215
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:16,442
So, how long you two been an item?

216
00:12:16,619 --> 00:12:18,553
- About...
- Like...

217
00:12:18,721 --> 00:12:20,552
Yeah!

218
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:24,387
It's been teetering there for weeks.

219
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,027
- Cheesy Curl?
- No, thank you.

220
00:12:26,195 --> 00:12:28,186
Too bad, they're addicting.

221
00:12:32,201 --> 00:12:33,930
- Booked.
- Booked. Booked.

222
00:12:34,103 --> 00:12:35,695
Nothing there or there.

223
00:12:35,871 --> 00:12:37,202
I am popular.

224
00:12:37,373 --> 00:12:39,364
Yes, you are.

225
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,872
All full. Not looking good. No.

226
00:12:44,213 --> 00:12:47,011
No, no, no.

227
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:50,380
- Nope, nope, nope.
- Booked, booked, booked.

228
00:12:59,595 --> 00:13:01,119
Bad news, guys.

229
00:13:01,297 --> 00:13:03,891
- Next available date is in two years.
- Two years?

230
00:13:04,934 --> 00:13:05,923
That's...

231
00:13:06,602 --> 00:13:08,365
...so long.
- Yeah.

232
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:10,963
Wait.

233
00:13:11,407 --> 00:13:13,705
- Hold on, hold on.
- Wasn't there a cancellation?

234
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:16,742
- I think it's...
- There, there!

235
00:13:16,912 --> 00:13:18,072
Yes, there it is.

236
00:13:18,247 --> 00:13:20,340
Three weeks from tomorrow, how is that?

237
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:24,784
That's a little quick.
Right? I mean...

238
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:29,388
Okay, I guess we're getting married
in three weeks.

239
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:31,253
Okay.

240
00:13:31,427 --> 00:13:32,724
- Just like that?
- Yeah.

241
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:36,854
- So it is written, so it shall be done.
- So it shall be done.

242
00:13:37,099 --> 00:13:39,294
Oh, boy.

243
00:13:39,468 --> 00:13:41,129
All right.

244
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:43,667
One small thing.

245
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,400
Couple years ago I instituted
a marriage preparation course here.

246
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:50,272
The course is a prerequisite
for all marriage ceremonies...

247
00:13:50,446 --> 00:13:52,778
...performed on these grounds.

248
00:13:53,015 --> 00:13:55,677
At the end of the course,
if I feel you're unprepared...

249
00:13:55,851 --> 00:14:00,413
...or you stop the course before completion,
I have the right to call off the wedding.

250
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:05,049
I'm sorry, but this isn't mandatory, right?
Because we're so ready to get married.

251
00:14:05,227 --> 00:14:07,320
- More than most.
- We strongly advise it.

252
00:14:07,496 --> 00:14:09,589
In other words, you have no choice.

253
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:11,594
With the divorce rate what it is...

254
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:12,927
50 percent.

255
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:15,297
Much higher for those
who live together first.

256
00:14:15,638 --> 00:14:17,799
You did say you lived together, right?

257
00:14:19,341 --> 00:14:21,206
I'm sorry, who are you again?

258
00:14:21,377 --> 00:14:23,470
I'm part of the Ministers
of Tomorrow program.

259
00:14:23,646 --> 00:14:25,341
Reverend Frank's my mentor.

260
00:14:25,514 --> 00:14:26,776
My little Mensa.

261
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,814
- I can see.
- Listen, kids.

262
00:14:28,984 --> 00:14:31,646
We wanna make sure you
are making the right decision...

263
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:34,288
...because your future happiness
depends on it.

264
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:36,617
Reverend Frank has a hundred
percent success...

265
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:38,987
...for those that make it
through the course.

266
00:14:39,161 --> 00:14:41,629
- But what about the people who...?
- Okay, we'll do it.

267
00:14:42,831 --> 00:14:44,890
- We're gonna do it.
- We're doing that?

268
00:14:45,067 --> 00:14:46,534
- It's awesome.
- We're doing this.

269
00:14:46,735 --> 00:14:47,793
That's my Sadie.

270
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:52,031
All right, we have three months of prep
to cram into three weeks.

271
00:14:52,207 --> 00:14:53,697
There's only a few rules.

272
00:14:53,876 --> 00:14:56,777
Rule number one:
you each have to write your own vows.

273
00:14:56,946 --> 00:14:59,141
You have a booklet,
and you share these vows...

274
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,510
...with each other at the ceremony.

275
00:15:02,551 --> 00:15:04,815
- That's really cool.
- Isn't it?

276
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,454
Okay. What's rule number two?

277
00:15:06,622 --> 00:15:08,988
Starting immediately,
no sex until the honeymoon.

278
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,620
I...

279
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,492
Are you serious?

280
00:15:20,069 --> 00:15:21,366
Oh, yeah.

281
00:15:23,606 --> 00:15:25,267
Tomorrow morning,
bright and early.

282
00:15:25,441 --> 00:15:26,430
Be there.

283
00:15:26,609 --> 00:15:28,338
We all remember the 11 th Commandment.

284
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,738
I don't.

285
00:15:30,646 --> 00:15:32,341
Thou shall not be late.

286
00:15:35,884 --> 00:15:38,182
We've got a hundred things
to start, but it's doable.

287
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,447
I just have to get Carlisle on the phone.

288
00:15:40,623 --> 00:15:44,457
- He was kidding about the no-sex thing?
- Carlisle? It's me. Get ready for this.

289
00:15:44,627 --> 00:15:47,187
- We will talk about the no-sex thing later.
- Okay, Ben.

290
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,092
No sex?

291
00:15:49,264 --> 00:15:52,165
That's supposed to happen
after you get married.

292
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:53,558
Joel, I come here...

293
00:15:53,736 --> 00:15:56,068
...for your compassion.
- I'm just giving you shit.

294
00:15:56,238 --> 00:15:58,729
Congratulations.
You are going to love marriage.

295
00:15:58,907 --> 00:16:00,807
Damn it, Joel.
What is wrong with you?

296
00:16:00,976 --> 00:16:03,103
You were supposed to be
watching them.

297
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:04,905
Shelly, baby, I'm on the roof.

298
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,742
Remember we said you won't
bother me when I'm on the roof?

299
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:10,009
- You're always on the roof.
- Exactly.

300
00:16:10,185 --> 00:16:11,982
- I heard that.
- Yeah.

301
00:16:12,154 --> 00:16:14,019
Where did this mud hole
even come from?

302
00:16:14,189 --> 00:16:16,885
Oh, my God,
I am so getting my tubes tied.

303
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:21,223
This reverend says he wants me to meet
him after church tomorrow one-on-one.

304
00:16:21,997 --> 00:16:23,589
What is that?

305
00:16:23,766 --> 00:16:25,757
You ever done that?
The marriage prep stuff?

306
00:16:25,934 --> 00:16:28,994
To tell you the truth, I don't remember
anything before D-day, man.

307
00:16:29,638 --> 00:16:31,196
It's like a black hole.

308
00:16:31,373 --> 00:16:33,807
All I know is that's my wife...

309
00:16:33,976 --> 00:16:35,637
...apparently those are my kids...

310
00:16:35,811 --> 00:16:38,609
...and this, this is my beer.

311
00:16:38,781 --> 00:16:41,511
Everything else is pretty much a blur.

312
00:16:42,117 --> 00:16:43,209
Yeah.

313
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,348
Thank you.

314
00:16:45,521 --> 00:16:47,011
That's why you're my best man.

315
00:16:48,123 --> 00:16:49,920
Two words for your bachelor party:

316
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:51,650
Strippers and Sizzler.

317
00:16:53,195 --> 00:16:55,095
I like to call it "beef and booty."

318
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,357
I heard that.

319
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:00,590
Oh, boy.

320
00:17:06,341 --> 00:17:08,571
Please, God, let somebody
be later than us.

321
00:17:08,744 --> 00:17:13,044
Hey. We'll just sneak in the back,
no one will notice.

322
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,007
We also ask...

323
00:17:15,184 --> 00:17:19,211
...that you watch over the Mansbridge
meat packers and their labor dispute.

324
00:17:19,388 --> 00:17:22,983
Grant our packers patience
as they await an amicable resolution...

325
00:17:23,392 --> 00:17:26,793
...with, Lord willing,
a four to six percent pay increase...

326
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:28,793
...and dental would be nice.

327
00:17:33,836 --> 00:17:36,464
Look who decided to show.

328
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:41,742
Choir! Let me hear it!

329
00:17:41,944 --> 00:17:45,607
<i>You're late, you're late</i>
<i>You're late, you're late</i>

330
00:17:45,781 --> 00:17:48,978
<i>God's on time</i>

331
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:52,780
<i>But you are very late</i>

332
00:17:54,623 --> 00:17:57,717
It's your first offense.
We'll let it slide.

333
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,020
It happens again, I'm telling the Big Guy.

334
00:18:01,196 --> 00:18:04,097
And I'm not talking about
Larry Carmichael over there on drums.

335
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,366
But seriously...

336
00:18:07,736 --> 00:18:10,204
...let us re-pray.

337
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,739
Sorry for bailing, Lord.
A brief interruption, but we're back.

338
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:16,810
We'd also like to pray for Walter...

339
00:18:16,979 --> 00:18:19,243
...recently returned from his
holiday in Thailand.

340
00:18:19,414 --> 00:18:21,075
Let's hope it's just a heat rash.

341
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:24,247
- Vivian.
- I don't know how you do it, Frank.

342
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:26,546
Every week your sermons
get better and better.

343
00:18:26,722 --> 00:18:30,055
It comes from upstairs, Vivian.
I'm just the TiVo.

344
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:32,124
It wasn't that good.

345
00:18:32,294 --> 00:18:33,454
- You ready?
- Yeah.

346
00:18:34,763 --> 00:18:36,560
I have to go. I have stuff to do...

347
00:18:36,732 --> 00:18:39,098
...but you guys enjoy
your man-talk, okay?

348
00:18:39,268 --> 00:18:41,327
Don't say anything about me
behind my back.

349
00:18:41,503 --> 00:18:44,028
You'll never know so...

350
00:18:44,506 --> 00:18:45,666
Tight.

351
00:18:45,841 --> 00:18:47,433
- Sorry?
- The car.

352
00:18:47,943 --> 00:18:50,207
- Hi.
- Bye.

353
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:53,238
You ready? A little one-on-one?

354
00:18:53,415 --> 00:18:55,076
- Yeah.
- Come on. Let's go.

355
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,013
The name of our team is the Crusaders.

356
00:18:57,186 --> 00:19:01,350
I didn't want to tell the kids about the
Children's Crusades, it bums them out.

357
00:19:01,523 --> 00:19:03,548
Wow, you really meant one-on-one.

358
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:05,317
Oh, yeah.

359
00:19:05,694 --> 00:19:07,025
- A little hoops?
- No.

360
00:19:07,196 --> 00:19:08,322
This ball needs Viagra.

361
00:19:09,765 --> 00:19:11,426
- Play catch?
- Sure, love catch.

362
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,830
It's my favorite sport.

363
00:19:14,002 --> 00:19:16,266
Pardon the glove.
We've had a few budget cutbacks.

364
00:19:16,438 --> 00:19:18,099
- Oh, that's all right.
- Back up.

365
00:19:18,674 --> 00:19:19,902
Okay.

366
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:22,600
What are you, a little girl's softball league?
Back up.

367
00:19:22,778 --> 00:19:24,177
Okay. Not a little girl.

368
00:19:24,346 --> 00:19:25,677
- Yeah.
- All right.

369
00:19:25,848 --> 00:19:27,713
It's nice to be able to chat with you...

370
00:19:27,883 --> 00:19:31,114
...without all this "I'm a pastor
who can send you to hell" nonsense.

371
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,714
No, me too. This is great.

372
00:19:32,888 --> 00:19:35,152
Little one-on-one time
with your spiritual elder.

373
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:38,025
Bless you, Benjamin.

374
00:19:39,161 --> 00:19:41,629
- Too hard?
- No. That's a...

375
00:19:41,797 --> 00:19:43,492
That's a good burn. Right?

376
00:19:43,665 --> 00:19:46,395
Anything that's painful
makes you stronger.

377
00:19:46,568 --> 00:19:49,435
Not really. You break your leg,
your leg doesn't get stronger.

378
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,800
God is just, but God is kind.

379
00:19:53,842 --> 00:19:55,867
That's a nice sentiment.

380
00:19:56,645 --> 00:19:58,340
Thank you.
Can I ask you something?

381
00:19:58,513 --> 00:20:00,003
- Sure.
- Sadie.

382
00:20:00,182 --> 00:20:01,774
Why do you love her?

383
00:20:03,085 --> 00:20:04,916
There's just so many reasons, you know?

384
00:20:05,087 --> 00:20:07,555
She's beautiful, inside and out.

385
00:20:07,723 --> 00:20:09,418
So, I'm lucky.

386
00:20:09,591 --> 00:20:11,650
What do you mean by "inside"?

387
00:20:12,828 --> 00:20:14,352
You meant spiritually, right?

388
00:20:14,529 --> 00:20:16,224
Yep. Exactly.

389
00:20:16,398 --> 00:20:18,423
Okay. What else?

390
00:20:20,269 --> 00:20:24,035
She's just smart, you know?
She's motivated, she's well-organized.

391
00:20:24,206 --> 00:20:26,106
She's probably
the hardest worker I know.

392
00:20:27,175 --> 00:20:30,042
Well, let me get this straight, then.
Correct me if I'm wrong.

393
00:20:30,212 --> 00:20:33,340
First thing you like about her is her looks.
But you really think...

394
00:20:33,515 --> 00:20:35,881
...she's a cute control freak.
- I didn't say that.

395
00:20:36,051 --> 00:20:40,647
- I know what you're getting at.
- "Organized" is code for OCD.

396
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:42,380
OCD is a...

397
00:20:42,557 --> 00:20:43,649
God!

398
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,788
Oh, my Lord.

399
00:20:48,397 --> 00:20:49,762
- You okay, big fella?
- Yeah.

400
00:20:49,932 --> 00:20:51,092
Oh, yeah?

401
00:20:51,266 --> 00:20:52,733
- How you doing...
- Totally fine.

402
00:20:52,901 --> 00:20:55,392
Let's see that. Come on.
Oh, no. That's bad.

403
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:56,867
I'm gonna have to heal you.

404
00:20:57,439 --> 00:20:59,703
- No, that's okay.
- No. I'm gonna have to heal you.

405
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:02,241
- I just need Advil.
- It's healing time. Stay down.

406
00:21:02,411 --> 00:21:04,345
Stay down. It's healing time.

407
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,509
- What's that mean?
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

408
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:09,708
Oh, Lord, surround him
with your light and grace.

409
00:21:09,885 --> 00:21:11,409
Lord have mercy!

410
00:21:11,586 --> 00:21:13,918
- The power of Christ compels you!
- Lord have mercy.

411
00:21:14,089 --> 00:21:15,716
The power of Christ compels you!

412
00:21:15,891 --> 00:21:18,223
- We have got to pray!
- Pray!

413
00:21:18,393 --> 00:21:19,951
- We have got to pray!
- Pray!

414
00:21:20,128 --> 00:21:22,255
We have got to pray to make it
through the day!

415
00:21:22,831 --> 00:21:23,855
Is that MC Hammer?

416
00:21:24,266 --> 00:21:27,258
- You're healed, right?
- Let me see. Let me see.

417
00:21:27,436 --> 00:21:30,803
- No, it's still bleeding.
- Let's go old school.

418
00:21:33,075 --> 00:21:35,339
Begone, demon spirit!

419
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:37,239
Begone!

420
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,472
- That's not helping at all.
- Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

421
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:43,277
Lord, take him up upon your wing...

422
00:21:43,452 --> 00:21:46,012
- Wait, take me where?
- lf you believed, you'd be healed.

423
00:21:46,188 --> 00:21:47,587
- Do you believe?
- Believe!

424
00:21:47,756 --> 00:21:49,849
- Believe!
- I'm healed, I'm healed, I'm healed.

425
00:21:50,025 --> 00:21:52,789
- Oh, it's a miracle! It's a miracle!
- It is. It is.

426
00:21:52,961 --> 00:21:55,259
You're not healed.
I'm not a doctor, I'm a pastor.

427
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:58,263
You know what you need?
Advil and ice. Come on.

428
00:21:58,433 --> 00:22:02,369
- Check him out, just see that he's okay.
- The nasal septum and concha are clear.

429
00:22:02,537 --> 00:22:06,029
- Good news, kid. Your nose is fine.
- Yeah, come on. Let me buy you a Coke.

430
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:08,642
Sorry about that.
You know, I have to try that stuff.

431
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:11,938
- Never works, but what if it had?
- Yeah.

432
00:22:12,114 --> 00:22:13,911
- Wouldn't that be crazy?
- Crazy.

433
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:17,209
It was great.

434
00:22:17,386 --> 00:22:19,980
Yes, totally.
Reverend Frank is the best.

435
00:22:20,155 --> 00:22:23,181
Listen, tomorrow night, I was th...

436
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:26,819
Group counseling for what?

437
00:22:32,334 --> 00:22:33,699
Okay, like we do every week.

438
00:22:33,869 --> 00:22:36,531
Danny, pick up Tenika
and carry her across that threshold.

439
00:22:36,705 --> 00:22:38,002
Yeah, that's it!

440
00:22:38,173 --> 00:22:40,505
Try and think of it like the first time.

441
00:22:40,675 --> 00:22:42,802
For a lot of you,
that wasn't the honeymoon.

442
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:46,679
Yeah, baby. Come on, Jim.

443
00:22:46,848 --> 00:22:48,008
My back is giving out.

444
00:22:48,183 --> 00:22:49,377
Don't focus on the pain.

445
00:22:49,551 --> 00:22:52,679
Look at the love that
Janine's giving you right now.

446
00:22:52,854 --> 00:22:55,448
And if that doesn't work,
think about potato skins.

447
00:22:55,991 --> 00:22:57,982
God, I love potato skins.

448
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,287
A husband will do anything
for appetizers.

449
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:01,520
Yes.

450
00:23:03,231 --> 00:23:05,859
Everybody, I want to introduce you
to two new members.

451
00:23:06,034 --> 00:23:08,901
This is Ben and Sadie.
They're getting married in three weeks.

452
00:23:09,071 --> 00:23:11,505
Ben, why don't you carry Sadie
across the threshold?

453
00:23:12,074 --> 00:23:13,598
Come on.

454
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:16,842
Come on. Yeah, come on.

455
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,840
Yeah, there you go.
Get across that threshold!

456
00:23:26,354 --> 00:23:28,049
Hurry.

457
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:32,326
- Oh, great.
- Look.

458
00:23:55,383 --> 00:23:57,112
Got it.

459
00:24:01,156 --> 00:24:02,316
Tonight...

460
00:24:02,491 --> 00:24:05,085
...we learn how to fight fairly.

461
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,749
Sorry.

462
00:24:06,928 --> 00:24:09,260
What if we've never had a fight before?

463
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:12,666
- Seriously think I'm gonna puke.
- Louise, no puking.

464
00:24:12,834 --> 00:24:15,496
They're young.
They're allowed to be enthusiastic.

465
00:24:16,004 --> 00:24:18,404
Never had a fight,
it's about time you had one.

466
00:24:18,573 --> 00:24:20,973
So please, step up
to the top of the circle.

467
00:24:21,143 --> 00:24:23,008
Come on, get your butts up there!

468
00:24:23,178 --> 00:24:25,942
Let's get this perfect relationship
on its feet.

469
00:24:26,114 --> 00:24:28,378
Put it to the test. Okay.

470
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,245
I want you to imagine.

471
00:24:30,418 --> 00:24:32,818
You're driving in the mountains.
It's nighttime.

472
00:24:32,988 --> 00:24:34,853
But there's a torrential downpour.

473
00:24:35,023 --> 00:24:36,752
That thing with the wipers like this:

474
00:24:37,425 --> 00:24:39,393
You're tired. You're lost.

475
00:24:39,794 --> 00:24:41,159
You're getting cranky.

476
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:43,461
What was that?

477
00:24:43,632 --> 00:24:45,964
You got a flat tire
because you just hit a pothole.

478
00:24:46,334 --> 00:24:48,529
Instant argument potential.

479
00:24:48,703 --> 00:24:50,432
What do you do? How do you handle it?

480
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:53,006
I think we'd probably just call AAA.

481
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:57,678
Out of cell phone range.
Can't use the cell phone. Can't call AAA.

482
00:24:57,846 --> 00:25:01,043
You gotta handle it the old-fashioned way.
You gotta change the tire.

483
00:25:01,216 --> 00:25:04,083
You're pissed at each other. Go.

484
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:10,119
Sorry I didn't see that pothole.

485
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:12,116
It's okay, honey.

486
00:25:12,294 --> 00:25:15,263
Accidents happen,
so just be more careful next time.

487
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:17,489
- Promise I will.
- Cut!

488
00:25:17,666 --> 00:25:20,726
You guys travel medicated?
That was like "Prozac Takes a Vacation."

489
00:25:20,902 --> 00:25:22,597
That's not what we're looking for.

490
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:26,867
Janine, why don't you and Jimbo show
them how this argument should play out?

491
00:25:27,042 --> 00:25:28,532
Sure.

492
00:25:32,981 --> 00:25:34,448
Hey, jackass!

493
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:37,881
I told you to take Route 45,
but again, you didn't listen!

494
00:25:38,053 --> 00:25:42,319
Now it's pissing down outside
and we're stuck God only knows where.

495
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:45,391
Yeah, well, if we hadn't
left three hours late...

496
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:49,519
...because someone was talking
to her ball-busting mother on the phone...

497
00:25:50,065 --> 00:25:52,659
...well, then, maybe we wouldn't
be in this position!

498
00:25:52,834 --> 00:25:55,359
You are a sad, sad man.

499
00:25:55,537 --> 00:25:58,665
You will not emasculate me anymore.

500
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,001
- Go to hell!
- No, you go to hell, Janine.

501
00:26:01,176 --> 00:26:04,407
- Go to hell.
- Okay. Cut.

502
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07,048
Everybody, Jim and Janine.

503
00:26:09,351 --> 00:26:11,683
We're gonna try something
a little different now.

504
00:26:11,853 --> 00:26:14,413
We're gonna do role reversal.

505
00:26:15,023 --> 00:26:16,354
All right.

506
00:26:16,524 --> 00:26:18,355
Sadie, I want you to be Ben.

507
00:26:18,526 --> 00:26:21,120
Ben, I want you to be Sadie.
Come on. Step up there.

508
00:26:21,296 --> 00:26:22,957
Come on, get up! Yeah!

509
00:26:23,131 --> 00:26:25,395
- Oh, gosh.
- Come on.

510
00:26:25,567 --> 00:26:27,034
You're gonna change the tire.

511
00:26:27,202 --> 00:26:28,999
Ben, tire's down here.

512
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:31,434
You're down in that muck.
Here's your lug wrench.

513
00:26:31,606 --> 00:26:33,767
The lugs are right here.
But they're tight.

514
00:26:33,942 --> 00:26:37,844
They're rusty, they're old, all right?
You can't get them off and you're angry...

515
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:41,744
...and you're cold, and you really...
You wanna tear each other apart.

516
00:26:41,916 --> 00:26:43,406
Go.

517
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:47,321
Don't you wish
we were in cell-phone range?

518
00:26:47,489 --> 00:26:50,117
Then we could just call
AAA like we always do.

519
00:26:50,292 --> 00:26:53,784
- Yeah, I don't know how we got so lost.
- I don't either.

520
00:26:53,962 --> 00:26:56,021
Ben, maybe we wouldn't
have gotten lost...

521
00:26:56,197 --> 00:27:00,361
...if you had just followed the TripTik
that I prepared three days in advance.

522
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:03,834
Well, I thought that I was following
the road signs pretty well.

523
00:27:04,005 --> 00:27:07,099
Just going with the flow, as usual.

524
00:27:08,677 --> 00:27:10,542
What was that?
What was that last thing?

525
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:13,875
I'm just going along for the ride.

526
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:16,745
Who was? You. As me.

527
00:27:18,353 --> 00:27:20,685
Well, I'm not really sure
how anything gets done...

528
00:27:20,855 --> 00:27:25,918
...if people aren't following my
very specific instructions, Ben.

529
00:27:26,227 --> 00:27:28,718
But I love it when you're in charge.

530
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:32,298
That way I don't have to
take too much responsibility, Sadie.

531
00:27:32,467 --> 00:27:36,335
Ben, don't you know that that's the only
way things get done around here?

532
00:27:36,971 --> 00:27:39,030
That's how things get done around here?
Good.

533
00:27:39,207 --> 00:27:40,606
I had no idea.

534
00:27:40,775 --> 00:27:42,709
- Thank you.
- Want me to show you?

535
00:27:42,877 --> 00:27:46,108
- He said counter...
- I think I have it under control!

536
00:27:50,151 --> 00:27:51,743
Dear Jesus!

537
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,354
- Potato skins down!
- Jim, Jim...

538
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:58,923
Come on, everybody!

539
00:27:59,127 --> 00:28:01,721
Five-second rule!

540
00:28:02,497 --> 00:28:03,828
Janine!

541
00:28:05,367 --> 00:28:07,164
Okay.
We'll pick up next week...

542
00:28:07,335 --> 00:28:09,667
...with balancing
the joint checking account.

543
00:28:16,478 --> 00:28:19,447
So are you writing your vows later or...?

544
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:22,139
No, I finished earlier.

545
00:28:22,917 --> 00:28:25,545
Hey, what color white should we
go with for the napkins?

546
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,119
There's ivory...

547
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:28,653
...and timid.

548
00:28:29,691 --> 00:28:30,988
Ivory.

549
00:28:31,159 --> 00:28:36,119
I don't know, I kind of feel like it might
clash with the pistachio in the centerpieces.

550
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:41,132
All right, well, you know what?
I'll just ask Carlisle tomorrow.

551
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:44,705
<i>Yeah, you know who else you could ask?</i>
<i>Reverend Frank.</i>

552
00:28:44,873 --> 00:28:46,568
<i>Because he loves giving his opinion.</i>

553
00:28:46,741 --> 00:28:48,208
<i>Why do you say it like that?</i>

554
00:28:48,376 --> 00:28:50,003
<i>I don't know. Maybe because...</i>

555
00:28:50,178 --> 00:28:52,646
...he's just a little bit...
- Knowledgeable.

556
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:55,749
- Yeah.
- "Intrusive." I was gonna go with intrusive.

557
00:28:57,352 --> 00:28:59,684
Ben, he's not intrusive, you know?
He's just...

558
00:28:59,854 --> 00:29:02,721
...observing our relationship right now.

559
00:29:03,057 --> 00:29:07,187
- Like a voyeur.
- Reverend Frank is not like a voyeur.

560
00:29:07,395 --> 00:29:09,863
- <i>A little bit.</i>
- <i>No, he's not.</i>

561
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:14,858
What was that? What are you doing?

562
00:29:15,036 --> 00:29:16,731
Do you want to walk the midget?

563
00:29:16,905 --> 00:29:18,031
Course I do, but...

564
00:29:18,206 --> 00:29:22,108
<i>... I don't think we should, because it's</i>
<i>against the rules until after the wedding.</i>

565
00:29:23,044 --> 00:29:24,875
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

566
00:29:25,246 --> 00:29:27,806
- You're actually following that rule?
- Yeah.

567
00:29:27,982 --> 00:29:31,383
Because I want to pass the course.
Don't you?

568
00:29:32,153 --> 00:29:34,713
- Yes, I want to pass the course.
- So?

569
00:29:34,889 --> 00:29:39,121
So, I also want to play Pickle Me, Tickle Me
with my really hot fiancée.

570
00:29:40,562 --> 00:29:42,052
Okay?

571
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:44,960
- Come on.
- What?

572
00:29:45,133 --> 00:29:46,430
No one else is gonna know.

573
00:29:46,601 --> 00:29:49,968
I'll know, Ben. I will know.
So just...

574
00:29:50,138 --> 00:29:51,696
Just please...

575
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:55,639
...let's stick to the program for now.
Okay? Thank you.

576
00:29:57,078 --> 00:29:59,308
Three weeks never killed anyone.

577
00:29:59,481 --> 00:30:01,346
Really?
Has that ever been documented?

578
00:30:01,516 --> 00:30:03,006
Good night.

579
00:30:07,755 --> 00:30:09,586
Good night, Ben.

580
00:30:17,966 --> 00:30:20,764
Okay, I'm a cigar vendor...

581
00:30:22,437 --> 00:30:24,268
- What?
- Go to bed.

582
00:30:24,439 --> 00:30:26,100
Thank you.

583
00:30:29,377 --> 00:30:31,140
What if I'm not tired?

584
00:30:31,813 --> 00:30:33,474
Yes!

585
00:30:33,648 --> 00:30:34,740
All clear.

586
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:37,680
- What'd I miss?
- None of your business.

587
00:30:37,852 --> 00:30:41,253
- But they're right on schedule.
- Their optimism is touching.

588
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:43,982
They remind me of the Anderson couple
we had last month.

589
00:30:44,158 --> 00:30:46,217
Yeah. You know what time it is?

590
00:30:46,661 --> 00:30:48,026
Time to turn up the heat.

591
00:30:48,196 --> 00:30:50,596
It's time to build on the foundation
we've set up.

592
00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:53,699
Remind me never to cross you.

593
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:05,571
I mean, I'm really glad
we're doing the course.

594
00:31:05,747 --> 00:31:08,272
I just wish Ben would take it
more seriously, you know?

595
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:10,417
What about these
in my bouquet, Lindsey?

596
00:31:10,585 --> 00:31:11,813
No.

597
00:31:11,986 --> 00:31:13,283
No?

598
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:18,084
I just want to feel some enthusiasm
from him, or is that expecting too much?

599
00:31:18,259 --> 00:31:21,092
Sadie, you have so much
to learn about men.

600
00:31:21,563 --> 00:31:23,258
Pink.

601
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:27,161
Flowers by Sadie, Sadie speaking.

602
00:31:28,002 --> 00:31:29,526
Meet where?

603
00:31:29,704 --> 00:31:31,638
I didn't even want to take this course...

604
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:34,331
...and now she's following it
to, like, the nth degree.

605
00:31:34,509 --> 00:31:37,376
Where are the cheerleaders?
Shouldn't they be practicing too?

606
00:31:37,545 --> 00:31:40,844
Come on, Famaletti! Deny that baseline!

607
00:31:41,015 --> 00:31:43,643
Coach Murphy, you were right
to put him on B-squad.

608
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:46,548
- Get ready, Zach.
- Or maybe I'm just overreacting.

609
00:31:46,721 --> 00:31:49,781
I mean, give and take, that's a part of
every healthy relationship.

610
00:31:50,124 --> 00:31:51,250
Give and what?

611
00:31:51,426 --> 00:31:53,087
- Give and take.
- Man, listen to me.

612
00:31:53,561 --> 00:31:57,122
Once a woman senses she has control,
she'll tell a thousand of her friends.

613
00:31:57,298 --> 00:32:01,291
Then they'll want control too.
"I want a little piece of this control stuff."

614
00:32:01,469 --> 00:32:05,599
Next thing you know, they'll be running
companies and having their own offices.

615
00:32:05,773 --> 00:32:09,539
Do not set dangerous precedents
for other men.

616
00:32:12,113 --> 00:32:13,774
Hello?

617
00:32:14,449 --> 00:32:15,438
Late for what?

618
00:32:15,617 --> 00:32:19,849
Welcome to Saint Catherine's Maternity,
birthplace to over 4000 babies each year.

619
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:23,115
That's almost 80 babies a week,
and we've never misplaced one.

620
00:32:23,291 --> 00:32:24,280
Okay, maybe one.

621
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:27,995
If you're shy, get your tubes tied now
and call it a day.

622
00:32:28,162 --> 00:32:30,756
A woman in labor basically
lies around almost naked...

623
00:32:30,932 --> 00:32:34,493
...while dozens of doctors and nurses
get a front row view of her wide open...

624
00:32:34,669 --> 00:32:37,001
Virginia! Put some gloves
on those hands right now!

625
00:32:37,171 --> 00:32:38,729
We're not delivering pizzas here.

626
00:32:38,906 --> 00:32:42,467
Labor could last anywhere from
a few hours to a few days.

627
00:32:43,177 --> 00:32:47,580
And that's not even counting the nine
months of constipation leading up to it.

628
00:32:47,749 --> 00:32:49,444
Of course, there's always drugs...

629
00:32:49,617 --> 00:32:52,586
...so you should figure out how
you feel about that beforehand.

630
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:54,419
l... Oh, God!

631
00:32:54,589 --> 00:32:57,217
And then be ready to toss
that decision out the window...

632
00:32:57,392 --> 00:33:00,327
...when the pain really kicks in.

633
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:03,561
A woman in labor
wouldn't even feel that.

634
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:05,289
Good to know.

635
00:33:05,466 --> 00:33:06,455
Or that.

636
00:33:06,634 --> 00:33:07,896
This way.

637
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:10,003
You squeamish, Ben?

638
00:33:10,505 --> 00:33:11,938
Little bit, I guess.

639
00:33:12,106 --> 00:33:15,007
You have to figure out if you're
gonna be in the delivery room.

640
00:33:15,176 --> 00:33:16,700
Oh, yeah, of course he will be.

641
00:33:16,878 --> 00:33:17,867
Yes.

642
00:33:18,046 --> 00:33:20,310
Some men are so traumatized
by the experience...

643
00:33:20,481 --> 00:33:23,450
...they can never look at their wives
the same again.

644
00:33:23,618 --> 00:33:25,142
Sexually, that is.

645
00:33:25,319 --> 00:33:27,981
Give me some slow, deep breaths.

646
00:33:28,156 --> 00:33:29,783
How many do you want to have?

647
00:33:29,957 --> 00:33:31,288
- Four?
- Two?

648
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:34,861
Big push. Big push.

649
00:33:35,029 --> 00:33:37,190
I need an epidural!

650
00:33:37,532 --> 00:33:40,797
Look at her! She's breathing fine!

651
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:42,296
What about me?

652
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,964
They say for a man to experience
the equivalent pain...

653
00:33:47,141 --> 00:33:49,302
...you'd have to pull your scrotum
over your head.

654
00:33:50,478 --> 00:33:51,775
That was incredible.

655
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:53,243
Glad you feel that way.

656
00:33:53,414 --> 00:33:55,905
Because now the real fun begins.

657
00:33:56,317 --> 00:33:58,046
Welcome to the world of parenting.

658
00:33:58,219 --> 00:34:01,382
- They breathe, they blink, they cry.
- And they're all yours.

659
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:05,292
Congratulations, you've just had twins.

660
00:34:08,863 --> 00:34:11,161
Look at how their little chests
move up and down.

661
00:34:11,332 --> 00:34:14,699
Yeah. Their creepy little chests.

662
00:34:14,869 --> 00:34:17,667
And you really want four of these things?

663
00:34:18,206 --> 00:34:21,004
I think it'd be nice to have
a big family, don't you?

664
00:34:21,175 --> 00:34:23,439
Yeah. No, no, definitely.

665
00:34:23,611 --> 00:34:24,635
Well, I mean...

666
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:27,474
...four might be kind of
a big commitment.

667
00:34:32,587 --> 00:34:35,420
Okay, do you want to take that?

668
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:39,590
No, you can do it. Come on.

669
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:44,495
Just pat him on the back really gently.

670
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:45,927
Okay.

671
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,658
Poor little baby.

672
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:51,032
Little creepy robot baby.

673
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:55,100
Oh, my God!

674
00:34:57,378 --> 00:34:59,505
- God.
- Hold on.

675
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:01,679
- Here you go.
- Stop, stop.

676
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:03,714
Hold on, hold on. There you go.

677
00:35:03,885 --> 00:35:06,080
- There's some on his shirt too.
- Okay.

678
00:35:06,254 --> 00:35:08,415
We can't forget to set the alarm for 8...

679
00:35:08,589 --> 00:35:11,422
...because we're going to Macy's
to register for the wedding.

680
00:35:11,592 --> 00:35:13,924
Wait, we're not bringing these
with us, are we?

681
00:35:14,095 --> 00:35:16,962
Come on, can't we just, like,
phone in our order or something?

682
00:35:17,131 --> 00:35:21,465
No, we're so jammed this week,
tomorrow's the only day we can do it.

683
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:28,070
Look at that. Fell back asleep.

684
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:30,173
So I did it.

685
00:35:30,344 --> 00:35:33,006
Looks like this parenting thing
isn't as hard as they say.

686
00:35:33,181 --> 00:35:34,978
See? You're a natural.

687
00:35:35,149 --> 00:35:36,138
Thanks.

688
00:35:36,317 --> 00:35:37,306
Night.

689
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:45,025
Ben? Ben!

690
00:35:45,193 --> 00:35:46,956
Ben!

691
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:48,488
Ben!

692
00:35:48,663 --> 00:35:50,722
Okay, I'm coming.

693
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:52,661
What? Hi.

694
00:35:52,834 --> 00:35:55,598
How many times do I have to knock, man?
How you doing?

695
00:35:55,803 --> 00:35:57,065
- Good.
- Good morning.

696
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:59,035
- Shelly's dad fell off a ladder.
- What?

697
00:35:59,207 --> 00:36:01,869
And unfortunately, he's gonna make it.
So we have to go...

698
00:36:02,043 --> 00:36:04,307
...and you are on brat patrol
for a couple hours.

699
00:36:04,478 --> 00:36:06,446
Thank you. Appreciate it.
Thanks a million.

700
00:36:13,221 --> 00:36:15,246
Hi.

701
00:36:15,857 --> 00:36:17,916
Which one's the biter?

702
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:21,960
All you have to do is point the gun at
the item you want and then pull the trigger.

703
00:36:22,129 --> 00:36:25,997
The computer instantly logs it in our registry
database for your guests to consider.

704
00:36:26,167 --> 00:36:28,499
There's no limit to how many
items I can choose?

705
00:36:28,669 --> 00:36:30,694
- When in doubt, zap it.
- Great.

706
00:36:30,872 --> 00:36:32,499
We only have a couple hours so...

707
00:36:32,673 --> 00:36:35,039
Chop-chop. Come on.

708
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:38,768
Okay. All right. Yep.

709
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:40,777
Guys, guys, guys,
slow down, slow down.

710
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:42,848
Hey. All right, that's good.

711
00:36:43,017 --> 00:36:46,544
Now we're going faster.
Stop, stop. Hello?

712
00:36:46,721 --> 00:36:47,983
All right, guys. All right.

713
00:36:48,155 --> 00:36:51,682
The yelling needs to hold off. All right.

714
00:36:52,393 --> 00:36:55,021
Hey, Ben, what do you like better?
The blue or the beige?

715
00:36:55,196 --> 00:36:56,788
The beige or the blue?

716
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:59,398
- I like the blue. Blue's good.
- Beige goes better...

717
00:36:59,567 --> 00:37:00,795
...with the placemats.

718
00:37:01,235 --> 00:37:02,998
Or beige. Let's just do beige.

719
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:04,637
I love beige.

720
00:37:05,239 --> 00:37:06,866
Beige it is.

721
00:37:16,183 --> 00:37:17,946
- Do you like this one?
- It's great.

722
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:21,145
- All right, let's get this one.
- Yeah, let's get a couple.

723
00:37:23,791 --> 00:37:25,986
Oh, I just got this text message
from Carlisle.

724
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,684
I got the wrong dinnerware.

725
00:37:27,862 --> 00:37:30,695
- Do you mean silverware? Can we just go?
- No, dinnerware.

726
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,764
- No way. That is not simulated.
- God, that's bad.

727
00:37:37,772 --> 00:37:39,706
Well, why don't you change the diaper...

728
00:37:39,874 --> 00:37:41,466
...and I'll go get the dinnerware?

729
00:37:41,642 --> 00:37:44,270
- Why don't we think about...
- Okay.

730
00:37:48,649 --> 00:37:49,673
Okay.

731
00:38:24,151 --> 00:38:25,709
Yeah.

732
00:38:28,689 --> 00:38:30,782
Stop! Oh, God!

733
00:38:30,958 --> 00:38:33,119
Stop, stop!

734
00:38:34,295 --> 00:38:37,526
Should we get the 500-thread count?
Ben, can you slow down a little bit?

735
00:38:37,698 --> 00:38:39,791
Oh, I'm trying.

736
00:38:44,972 --> 00:38:46,371
Oh, my God.

737
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:47,564
Sorry. Ben?

738
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:49,676
- Give me one, please?
- Will you take that?

739
00:38:49,844 --> 00:38:51,311
I'm gonna give you one.

740
00:38:51,479 --> 00:38:54,846
- I will help you by getting this one thing...
- I'm sorry.

741
00:38:55,016 --> 00:38:56,711
Guys, guys, guys, it's okay.

742
00:38:58,552 --> 00:39:00,179
- Come here. Come on, come on.
- Okay.

743
00:39:00,354 --> 00:39:02,652
Ben, don't drop him!

744
00:39:02,823 --> 00:39:04,654
Here, take the kids. Come on, come on.

745
00:39:04,825 --> 00:39:06,315
Boys, let's go. Come on.

746
00:39:06,494 --> 00:39:09,725
Hi, I'm looking for some Pima cotton
or Egyptian cotton sheets.

747
00:39:09,897 --> 00:39:12,297
Something that really seems to breathe.
I'm sorry.

748
00:39:12,466 --> 00:39:15,697
I can't seem to find them over there
and I have...

749
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:18,430
Get off the bed.
All right.

750
00:39:20,408 --> 00:39:21,875
Get off the bed.

751
00:39:22,043 --> 00:39:25,604
Enough. Okay, enough.
No, no. Okay. Stop!

752
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:28,476
No, no, no.
Guys, no, no, no.

753
00:39:28,649 --> 00:39:32,346
Just stop. Sorry.
It's fine. It's just a...

754
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,851
Stop.

755
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:39,016
Stop it! Stop, you stupid... Shut up!

756
00:39:39,193 --> 00:39:44,460
Just shut up, shut up, shut up!
Shut up, shut up! Shut it! Shut it!

757
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:47,226
- Hey! What the hell are you doing?!
- I'm sorry.

758
00:39:47,601 --> 00:39:49,660
Thank God. I've had a long day.

759
00:39:49,837 --> 00:39:52,305
These are fake. Watch. See?

760
00:39:54,275 --> 00:39:55,765
No, no, no, we're on our way.

761
00:39:55,943 --> 00:40:00,141
We just got a little detained at Macy's.
Well, Ben did.

762
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:02,544
For being a public nuisance.

763
00:40:02,716 --> 00:40:04,707
It's a long story.

764
00:40:04,885 --> 00:40:08,116
Okay. Bye.

765
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:10,453
Well, I'll tell you...

766
00:40:10,624 --> 00:40:13,616
...l'm a lot more prepared for kids now.

767
00:40:14,095 --> 00:40:15,153
Like way more.

768
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:18,958
Why are there 56 bras on here?

769
00:40:38,419 --> 00:40:40,819
Pour a glass of that for yourself.
Have a glass.

770
00:40:40,988 --> 00:40:44,651
All right, I got it. This is it.
You, my dear, look amazing.

771
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:48,358
I can't believe all these cheeses.

772
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:51,020
I know.
I don't even know which to start with.

773
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:53,826
- There are so many.
- It's funny. Cheez Whiz or Velveeta.

774
00:40:54,001 --> 00:40:56,970
That's about as complicated
as my cheese dilemmas usually get.

775
00:40:57,138 --> 00:41:00,369
I think I prefer the nutty
Comté Saint-Antoine, which is this one.

776
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:02,805
- All right, this is it?
- From the Basque region...

777
00:41:02,977 --> 00:41:05,878
...and go.
Gonna change your life.

778
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:09,948
- Oh, my God. Carlisle.
- Oh, my God. Carlisle. Wait a minute.

779
00:41:10,117 --> 00:41:13,609
Ben, Carlisle's totally right.
I mean, this nutty cheese is the way to go.

780
00:41:13,787 --> 00:41:15,652
It's so good. You have to try it.

781
00:41:15,823 --> 00:41:19,657
- The white one? Good.
- You were right. You recommended it too.

782
00:41:20,861 --> 00:41:22,954
- Hey, everybody.
- Hey!

783
00:41:23,697 --> 00:41:26,495
Every time I hear the word
"cheese us," I'm in.

784
00:41:26,667 --> 00:41:28,157
Praise Gouda.

785
00:41:30,004 --> 00:41:32,404
Look at all of you,
you're all dressed to the nines.

786
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:34,598
Oh, Lindsey, you look fabulous.

787
00:41:34,775 --> 00:41:37,573
- Oh, thank you.
- How's life after the big D?

788
00:41:39,146 --> 00:41:40,374
That bad, huh?

789
00:41:40,648 --> 00:41:42,946
Men are a little too hard to train so...

790
00:41:43,117 --> 00:41:47,554
Thought I'd stop trying
and live vicariously through Ben's training.

791
00:41:49,523 --> 00:41:51,616
Here I was thinking I was
already housebroken.

792
00:41:51,792 --> 00:41:52,781
Maybe not.

793
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,188
- Cute.
- It's refreshing...

794
00:41:54,361 --> 00:41:56,386
...how honest you are.
It doesn't happen...

795
00:41:56,564 --> 00:41:58,759
...that easily for a lot of in-laws.
- Really?

796
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:02,027
Because I feel like we all
get along really well.

797
00:42:02,203 --> 00:42:04,865
You know what, Ben is a wonderful
addition to this family.

798
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:06,506
Wow, thank you.

799
00:42:06,674 --> 00:42:08,539
Whatever.
There's a little awkwardness...

800
00:42:08,709 --> 00:42:10,836
...but nothing more
than just new family stuff.

801
00:42:11,011 --> 00:42:13,639
You know a great way around
new family awkwardness?

802
00:42:13,814 --> 00:42:16,112
- Word association.
- Excuse me?

803
00:42:16,283 --> 00:42:18,410
It's fun, really. You go around the table...

804
00:42:18,586 --> 00:42:21,555
...and you pick one word that best
describes each in-law...

805
00:42:21,722 --> 00:42:23,815
...then they pick one word
that describes you.

806
00:42:23,991 --> 00:42:29,088
- A give and take, kind of an icebreaker...
- I think it sounds so fun. I love games.

807
00:42:29,263 --> 00:42:30,753
That's the spirit, Grandma.

808
00:42:30,931 --> 00:42:32,762
Ben, start with Grandma.

809
00:42:32,933 --> 00:42:36,562
One word to describe Grandma.

810
00:42:37,371 --> 00:42:40,602
That word would be...

811
00:42:40,774 --> 00:42:42,332
...wisdom.

812
00:42:42,509 --> 00:42:43,669
Excellent.

813
00:42:43,844 --> 00:42:45,709
Grandma. What about Ben?

814
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,477
Peculiar for his age.

815
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:51,140
Let's just try and stick with one word.

816
00:42:51,385 --> 00:42:54,479
- I'd just say peculiar.
- Okay.

817
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:56,987
We have a winner.
Game over. I think.

818
00:42:57,157 --> 00:43:00,217
- No, no, come on. What about Lindsey?
- I don't wanna do it.

819
00:43:00,394 --> 00:43:02,954
Don't think.
What's the first word comes to your mind?

820
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:04,791
Go for it.

821
00:43:06,033 --> 00:43:07,466
Blond.

822
00:43:07,635 --> 00:43:09,034
- Are you kidding me?
- Golden.

823
00:43:09,203 --> 00:43:12,798
No, gold. No, like you exude gold.
Not dumb, though.

824
00:43:12,973 --> 00:43:15,669
- I didn't say dumb.
- You didn't say dumb. You said blond.

825
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:17,572
Okay. Blond Lindsey.

826
00:43:17,745 --> 00:43:20,680
Oh, my tur... Okay, awesome!
Yes, okay, so...

827
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:24,078
Assertive.

828
00:43:24,551 --> 00:43:28,453
If you need someone to take the bull
by the horns, Ben's your guy.

829
00:43:29,723 --> 00:43:31,247
That's a good one.
Not that good.

830
00:43:31,425 --> 00:43:34,485
I mean, she's laughing a little
too hard for it, but good joke.

831
00:43:36,096 --> 00:43:38,360
This is terrific.
See how you're breaking the ice?

832
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:41,092
There's something new happening now.
Take a shot at Dad.

833
00:43:41,268 --> 00:43:43,133
- There we go.
- Sadie's dad is...

834
00:43:43,304 --> 00:43:44,362
He's outgoing.

835
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:47,666
- Outgoing, like saying "nice."
- That's very fitting.

836
00:43:47,841 --> 00:43:49,536
You're not shedding any light.

837
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:51,837
- Come on, you can do better than this.
- Yes.

838
00:43:52,012 --> 00:43:53,445
- Let it rip.
- No, no, no.

839
00:43:53,614 --> 00:43:56,242
- No, don't push me. I'm not gonna...
- He's asking, Ben.

840
00:43:56,417 --> 00:43:57,782
- Go, come on.
- All right.

841
00:43:59,486 --> 00:44:00,748
What about pompous?

842
00:44:00,921 --> 00:44:05,187
- I'm a little pompous.
- What's the <i>Wizard of Oz</i> thing? Pompous.

843
00:44:05,793 --> 00:44:07,090
No, I was just kidding.

844
00:44:07,261 --> 00:44:11,459
No. No, no, no.
It's all right. I asked for it.

845
00:44:11,632 --> 00:44:15,466
I just meant somebody likes
to hear the sound of their own voice.

846
00:44:15,836 --> 00:44:17,326
Now you're getting interesting.

847
00:44:17,504 --> 00:44:19,096
Pompous dad, back at Ben.

848
00:44:19,273 --> 00:44:21,241
- Here it is.
- Okay.

849
00:44:21,875 --> 00:44:24,241
- How about vanilla?
- Whoa, mom!

850
00:44:24,411 --> 00:44:25,901
Called you vanilla.

851
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,344
Could be bland, I'm not sure,
but it's your call.

852
00:44:28,515 --> 00:44:32,884
- Back at mom. Come on, Ben.
- Okay, "Stepford-y." Stepfordy.

853
00:44:33,053 --> 00:44:35,851
Stepfordy? Is that an adjective?

854
00:44:36,023 --> 00:44:37,718
Yeah, it just describes, you know:

855
00:44:37,891 --> 00:44:41,452
"Let's just sweep everything under the rug
with a pat on the back, a smile...

856
00:44:41,628 --> 00:44:44,620
...and don't forget the glass of champagne
to take the edge off."

857
00:44:44,798 --> 00:44:46,197
You're on a roll. Come on.

858
00:44:46,367 --> 00:44:49,063
Do we have any problems here?
If we did, we'd just...

859
00:44:49,236 --> 00:44:54,230
...throw some money at it because we
all know there's nothing money can't buy.

860
00:44:57,945 --> 00:45:00,106
Can't buy communication like this.

861
00:45:01,682 --> 00:45:05,118
<i>Hey, Ben, I thought you were</i>
<i>really great with my family today.</i>

862
00:45:05,285 --> 00:45:06,582
Are you making fun of me?

863
00:45:06,754 --> 00:45:08,847
No. No. Course not.

864
00:45:09,022 --> 00:45:10,182
It sounded like you were.

865
00:45:10,357 --> 00:45:12,484
I'm not making fun of you.
The fact that you...

866
00:45:12,659 --> 00:45:15,651
...lost your mind and embarrassed yourself
in front of everyone.

867
00:45:15,829 --> 00:45:18,730
No, that's not making fun of anyone.

868
00:45:21,568 --> 00:45:24,128
- Okay.
- What?

869
00:45:24,405 --> 00:45:26,873
- Time for a punishment. Come here.
- No.

870
00:45:30,444 --> 00:45:31,433
<i>What are you doing?</i>

871
00:45:31,612 --> 00:45:35,104
- <i>What does it look like I'm doing?</i>
- <i>Something that's very against the rules.</i>

872
00:45:35,282 --> 00:45:36,806
Mayday.

873
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:44,814
Hi. Just in the neighborhood...

874
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:47,358
...thought I'd drop by,
make a little house call.

875
00:45:47,528 --> 00:45:48,961
Yeah, of course you were.

876
00:45:49,129 --> 00:45:51,757
- Am I interrupting anything?
- No, no, no. Come on in.

877
00:45:51,932 --> 00:45:54,423
- Oh, thanks. Yay.
- Come on in.

878
00:45:54,601 --> 00:45:57,968
- Hi.
- I won't overstay my welcome.

879
00:45:58,505 --> 00:46:01,099
I just wanted to check
and see if everything was okay...

880
00:46:01,275 --> 00:46:05,041
...because after the tasting,
things were a little tense with the in-laws.

881
00:46:05,212 --> 00:46:07,043
Nope. No tension here.

882
00:46:07,881 --> 00:46:09,348
Can I be frank?

883
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:11,040
Of course, I'm Frank.

884
00:46:11,218 --> 00:46:13,015
Pardon the pun...

885
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:16,384
...but at this stage in the course,
I usually find out that...

886
00:46:16,557 --> 00:46:19,720
...a lot of couples resort to sex
as a quick fix for their problems.

887
00:46:19,893 --> 00:46:23,090
I just wanna make sure you're
strong enough to resist the temptation.

888
00:46:23,263 --> 00:46:26,027
- Yeah. We are.
- Yeah.

889
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,532
Does that make you uncomfortable, Ben?

890
00:46:28,902 --> 00:46:32,030
No, I'm not uncomfortable
talking about sex, no.

891
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:34,504
Having you in my living room
talking about sex...

892
00:46:34,675 --> 00:46:37,769
...that makes me a little uncomfortable.
Yeah.

893
00:46:37,945 --> 00:46:40,106
The number one rule of a good sex life...

894
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:42,009
...is not being so serious.

895
00:46:42,182 --> 00:46:43,444
You know, because...

896
00:46:43,617 --> 00:46:45,812
...if the humor goes,
there goes the intimacy...

897
00:46:45,986 --> 00:46:48,853
...and then there goes the marriage,
then divorce, yada, yada.

898
00:46:49,256 --> 00:46:51,224
But there is a remedy.

899
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:54,258
Knowing what your partner likes sexually.
How do you find out?

900
00:46:54,428 --> 00:46:57,226
Well, you ask. That's kind of wonderful.

901
00:46:57,397 --> 00:47:00,230
Hey, one little exercise,
then I'm Audi 5000, okay?

902
00:47:00,801 --> 00:47:01,825
Ben.

903
00:47:02,002 --> 00:47:04,334
Look at Sadie
and complete this sentence:

904
00:47:04,505 --> 00:47:06,632
"I like it when..."

905
00:47:10,777 --> 00:47:14,338
- This is ridiculous. I'm not doing it.
- It's not, Ben. Come on, I wanna know.

906
00:47:14,515 --> 00:47:16,779
I don't wanna talk about it.
I don't wanna do it.

907
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:18,417
I wanna know.

908
00:47:19,052 --> 00:47:20,781
Please.

909
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:24,488
Sadie.

910
00:47:25,492 --> 00:47:29,019
I really like it when...

911
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:31,860
...Reverend Frank doesn't
interrupt us before sex.

912
00:47:32,032 --> 00:47:33,761
I'm glad I got that off my chest.

913
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:35,492
- Okay.
- That's okay.

914
00:47:35,669 --> 00:47:38,536
You're not comfortable with this,
let's show him how to do it.

915
00:47:38,705 --> 00:47:41,833
- Don't hold back.
- I like it when it's out of the ordinary...

916
00:47:42,009 --> 00:47:43,408
...personally.

917
00:47:43,577 --> 00:47:47,274
That's weird, because I always pictured you
as a kind of in-the-bedroom person.

918
00:47:47,447 --> 00:47:51,349
- No, not really. No.
- Hi! Whoa! Out of the ordinary?

919
00:47:51,518 --> 00:47:52,746
We're out of the ordinary.

920
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:56,549
Because I remember having sex
on this carpet and I got a rug burn.

921
00:47:56,723 --> 00:47:57,951
- Ouch.
- Yeah.

922
00:47:58,125 --> 00:47:59,592
One time, though.
It was great...

923
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,819
...but it's more the exception
than the rule.

924
00:48:01,995 --> 00:48:04,623
- I'm talking about, like, real spontaneity.
- Like what?

925
00:48:04,798 --> 00:48:06,959
Like my parents' bathroom?

926
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:09,398
Oh, yeah, and everyone's
downstairs having dinner.

927
00:48:09,570 --> 00:48:11,970
- Exactly. Or on the beach.
- Under a towel.

928
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:14,607
- At work.
- In the office supply room.

929
00:48:14,775 --> 00:48:18,506
Or maybe at your grandmother's house
while she's in the kitchen making tea.

930
00:48:18,679 --> 00:48:20,442
Yes! I love it when you get creative.

931
00:48:20,647 --> 00:48:23,013
You have no idea.
I love it when you take control.

932
00:48:23,183 --> 00:48:24,548
What do you like about that?

933
00:48:24,718 --> 00:48:27,152
Okay! That's enough of that!

934
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:29,289
Ben, come on. This is just an exercise.

935
00:48:29,456 --> 00:48:31,356
- We were talking through it. Yes!
- No. No.

936
00:48:31,525 --> 00:48:34,153
Sadie.
Pushups, that's an exercise.

937
00:48:34,895 --> 00:48:37,159
No. No, I see
Ben's point of view here.

938
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:39,060
Maybe we're rushing things a bit.

939
00:48:39,232 --> 00:48:41,700
Maybe I should pencil in
the date two years from now.

940
00:48:41,902 --> 00:48:44,462
- Okay.
- Sorry to bother you. Good night.

941
00:48:44,638 --> 00:48:50,235
I'll let myself out. I know the way.
You have a good night. I'm going out now.

942
00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:53,004
- What was that?
- Please.

943
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:54,169
Reverend Frank!

944
00:48:55,716 --> 00:48:57,343
So we back on schedule?

945
00:48:57,517 --> 00:48:59,951
He's a reverend.
What did you think was gonna happen?

946
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:03,021
Well, I can't believe you were
talking to him like that.

947
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:08,753
I can't believe the first man to actually ask
me what I like in bed was my minister.

948
00:49:26,278 --> 00:49:27,472
Son of a...

949
00:49:47,066 --> 00:49:52,003
Hey, get your butt out the way!
This ain't no damn pedestrian crossing!

950
00:49:52,171 --> 00:49:54,366
So you're telling me
he bugged your apartment?

951
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:56,508
Yes.
And who knows what he heard?

952
00:49:56,675 --> 00:49:59,542
I mean, this guy is sick,
and I can't wait to tell Sadie.

953
00:49:59,712 --> 00:50:02,078
- She's gonna freak out.
- You cannot tell Sadie.

954
00:50:02,248 --> 00:50:05,342
You think she's gonna believe her
reverend is bugging your bedroom?

955
00:50:05,517 --> 00:50:07,246
Of course she will. I have evidence.

956
00:50:07,419 --> 00:50:09,114
Does this bug have his name on it?

957
00:50:09,288 --> 00:50:11,085
No. But...

958
00:50:11,590 --> 00:50:12,614
All right.

959
00:50:12,791 --> 00:50:15,055
We can talk about this later
if you need to focus.

960
00:50:15,227 --> 00:50:18,094
I'm good. This is about you.
Lady in the wheelchair, please!

961
00:50:18,831 --> 00:50:20,025
Listen.

962
00:50:20,199 --> 00:50:22,531
The lines of communication
have to be shut down...

963
00:50:22,701 --> 00:50:26,137
...between you and your woman.
She trusts the reverend completely now.

964
00:50:26,305 --> 00:50:28,603
She trusts him so much
she's calling Shelly...

965
00:50:28,774 --> 00:50:32,107
...and telling her how we need
to take a course to help our marriage.

966
00:50:32,511 --> 00:50:34,843
So I'm supposed to take this lying down?

967
00:50:35,014 --> 00:50:38,108
No. Look, let me make this simple, okay?

968
00:50:38,317 --> 00:50:41,718
We have to punch a hole in Frank's
holier-than-thou armor.

969
00:50:41,887 --> 00:50:46,688
We have to find his deepest,
darkest secret and take him down.

970
00:50:47,593 --> 00:50:49,220
Roach coach.

971
00:50:50,262 --> 00:50:52,230
Roach coach!

972
00:51:19,858 --> 00:51:21,587
I'm not doing that. I'm not doing it.

973
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:24,251
Thrust, thrust.

974
00:51:26,231 --> 00:51:29,530
All right, I know you're gonna find
something you like with this group.

975
00:51:29,702 --> 00:51:32,068
See, this is just what I gravitate towards.

976
00:51:32,237 --> 00:51:35,695
- Really simple.
- And no diamond? I'm fine with that.

977
00:51:39,545 --> 00:51:40,739
Split up?

978
00:51:41,947 --> 00:51:43,676
Come apart.

979
00:52:42,941 --> 00:52:43,930
Excuse me.

980
00:52:44,109 --> 00:52:46,669
Hi. I'm just here to pick up my rings.

981
00:52:46,845 --> 00:52:49,609
- Last name's Murphy.
- Murphy.

982
00:52:50,749 --> 00:52:52,774
- Okay, there you go.
- Oh, great. Thank you.

983
00:52:52,951 --> 00:52:54,816
Let's take a look.

984
00:52:54,987 --> 00:52:56,249
Oh, wow.

985
00:52:56,422 --> 00:52:58,413
- They're really beauti...
- Thank you.

986
00:52:59,792 --> 00:53:02,818
I'm sorry, does that say "Never to fart"?

987
00:53:03,028 --> 00:53:05,155
That's what you wrote
on your inscription form.

988
00:53:05,330 --> 00:53:07,264
I'm sorry, I wrote "Never to part."

989
00:53:07,433 --> 00:53:09,298
I don't know who would've
written "fart."

990
00:53:09,468 --> 00:53:12,164
- That's ridiculous.
- We get pretty strange requests here...

991
00:53:12,337 --> 00:53:16,774
...and we just engrave whatever is written,
and there you go.

992
00:53:16,942 --> 00:53:19,706
- Yep. "Never to part."
- "Never to fart."

993
00:53:21,246 --> 00:53:23,237
- No, that's a P.
- It's an F, sir.

994
00:53:23,415 --> 00:53:27,010
Nope, that's a P. Do you see how
that comes around in a P way?

995
00:53:27,419 --> 00:53:28,511
- Judith?
- Yes?

996
00:53:28,687 --> 00:53:31,212
Could you come over here
just for a tiny little second?

997
00:53:31,390 --> 00:53:32,823
Thank you. Judith...

998
00:53:32,991 --> 00:53:35,289
- Sure.
- What is this letter there?

999
00:53:36,829 --> 00:53:38,854
- That is an F.
- No, that's a P.

1000
00:53:39,031 --> 00:53:40,999
It's a P.
It comes around like a P.

1001
00:53:41,166 --> 00:53:44,067
Well, actually, if you look,
there's clearly a gap in the curl.

1002
00:53:44,236 --> 00:53:46,568
There's no gap in the curl.
Judith? It connects.

1003
00:53:46,738 --> 00:53:48,137
That's a P. "Never to part."

1004
00:53:48,307 --> 00:53:51,174
- Mark, could you just come...
- I don't know that we need Mark.

1005
00:53:51,343 --> 00:53:53,208
...a little quick second here?

1006
00:53:53,378 --> 00:53:56,040
- And what is that?
- Oh, the novelty inscription, yes.

1007
00:53:56,215 --> 00:53:59,582
Mark, it's not a novelty inscription.
It's a romantic inscription.

1008
00:53:59,751 --> 00:54:01,548
Excuse me.
What is this letter?

1009
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:06,555
- It's an F. I do teach penmanship.
- I took his class. It's wonderful.

1010
00:54:07,059 --> 00:54:08,720
- It's pretty clearly an F.
- Yeah.

1011
00:54:08,894 --> 00:54:09,883
Excuse me, excuse me.

1012
00:54:10,062 --> 00:54:12,223
Hi. I'm really sorry
to bother you. Very nice.

1013
00:54:12,397 --> 00:54:17,096
Could I ask you to help us out with
a problem here, just a little problem?

1014
00:54:17,269 --> 00:54:19,328
Could we show the normal person?
Thank you.

1015
00:54:19,505 --> 00:54:24,807
What would you call the letter between
the fingers that I'm pointing at right there?

1016
00:54:25,077 --> 00:54:26,669
- What is that?
- An F?

1017
00:54:26,845 --> 00:54:29,279
- I'm sorry, sir? Louder, please?
- An F?

1018
00:54:29,448 --> 00:54:30,437
- F.
- Yes.

1019
00:54:30,616 --> 00:54:33,779
- That's right.
- Okay, excuse me. Hi. All right.

1020
00:54:33,952 --> 00:54:35,920
I'm getting married in two days.

1021
00:54:36,088 --> 00:54:38,886
Thank you.
I really need that to say "Never to part."

1022
00:54:39,057 --> 00:54:41,719
- That's very nice.
- "Never to part." That's so sweet.

1023
00:54:41,894 --> 00:54:43,054
And that's what I wrote.

1024
00:54:43,228 --> 00:54:46,356
I need it to say "Never to part,"
and I need it done immediately.

1025
00:54:46,532 --> 00:54:49,365
So how do we do that?
How do we get that done?

1026
00:54:49,535 --> 00:54:51,526
We could have it tomorrow.
In the morning.

1027
00:54:51,703 --> 00:54:53,603
Great.
And that's what we can do.

1028
00:54:53,772 --> 00:54:55,364
But there's a $250 rush fee.

1029
00:54:55,541 --> 00:54:58,942
So I'm spending $250 on something
I asked you to do in the first place?

1030
00:54:59,111 --> 00:55:00,669
And we can guarantee that.

1031
00:55:03,282 --> 00:55:05,580
This is ridiculous. There's nothing here.

1032
00:55:05,751 --> 00:55:07,309
Oh, come on, man.

1033
00:55:07,486 --> 00:55:10,284
If that old lady from
<i>Murder, She Wrote</i> can do this...

1034
00:55:10,455 --> 00:55:12,980
...then we can find something.

1035
00:55:13,158 --> 00:55:16,321
- Are you talking about Angela L...
- Just keep looking.

1036
00:55:18,497 --> 00:55:19,486
What is that?

1037
00:55:19,665 --> 00:55:21,633
Frank Littleton. That's his address.

1038
00:55:23,202 --> 00:55:25,830
But who's Maria Gonzales?

1039
00:55:51,630 --> 00:55:53,120
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Joel, it's Ben.

1040
00:55:53,298 --> 00:55:54,822
There's no one here by that name.

1041
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,491
Is there another name
you'd maybe like to try?

1042
00:55:57,669 --> 00:55:59,261
Eagle, it's Sapphire.

1043
00:55:59,438 --> 00:56:01,269
Copy that, Sapphire.
What's your 20?

1044
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:02,907
I'm at John the Baptist's house.

1045
00:56:03,375 --> 00:56:05,104
- <i>What's he doing?</i>
- He's showering.

1046
00:56:05,744 --> 00:56:07,769
Dude, you're watching
him take a shower?

1047
00:56:07,946 --> 00:56:09,174
No, I'm outside.

1048
00:56:09,681 --> 00:56:11,114
Then get your butt inside.

1049
00:56:11,283 --> 00:56:14,946
- What? Are you nuts? I'm gonna get caught.
- Listen, the rehearsal's tomorrow.

1050
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:17,179
You've only got today to blow the lid off.

1051
00:56:17,356 --> 00:56:18,550
It's your only chance.

1052
00:56:18,724 --> 00:56:22,125
Strike first, strike hard. No mercy.

1053
00:56:29,768 --> 00:56:31,030
What the hell am I doing?

1054
00:56:50,222 --> 00:56:51,587
Stop!

1055
00:57:23,121 --> 00:57:24,588
Maria Gonzales.

1056
00:57:30,762 --> 00:57:31,786
I got you, sucker M.C.

1057
00:57:38,403 --> 00:57:40,803
Hi.

1058
00:57:41,073 --> 00:57:43,405
Wow, look at you...

1059
00:57:43,575 --> 00:57:45,702
...priest dog.

1060
00:57:47,679 --> 00:57:49,704
Hi.

1061
00:57:49,881 --> 00:57:51,075
I'm gonna...

1062
00:57:51,249 --> 00:57:52,682
No. No, no!

1063
00:58:00,292 --> 00:58:02,192
That's so gross.

1064
00:58:10,235 --> 00:58:11,463
Nicodemus!

1065
00:58:11,636 --> 00:58:13,365
Nicodemus!

1066
00:58:13,739 --> 00:58:15,730
No, no, no, no!

1067
00:58:16,274 --> 00:58:17,332
Nicodemus.

1068
00:58:17,509 --> 00:58:19,500
Leave Mr. Socks alone.

1069
00:58:19,678 --> 00:58:22,340
Nicodemus! Bad Nicodemus!

1070
00:58:22,514 --> 00:58:25,415
These are my Cheesy Curls.
No, don't you run away.

1071
00:58:25,617 --> 00:58:28,950
Bad. These are mine.

1072
00:58:29,254 --> 00:58:32,087
This is good.
Things are really good.

1073
00:58:32,257 --> 00:58:36,387
And I'm not even concerned with the fact
that Ben hasn't written his vows yet.

1074
00:58:36,561 --> 00:58:39,121
- Really?
- No.

1075
00:58:39,297 --> 00:58:45,099
He's just drawn this little animated truck
going through a hoop of fire.

1076
00:58:45,804 --> 00:58:47,396
You know what?

1077
00:58:47,639 --> 00:58:49,072
It's actually better.

1078
00:58:49,241 --> 00:58:51,300
Because he's waiting
until the last second...

1079
00:58:51,476 --> 00:58:55,913
...when his mind is completely clear
and he can just say what he really means.

1080
00:58:56,882 --> 00:58:59,373
- Okay, hold on.
- What do we think? What's the verdict?

1081
00:58:59,551 --> 00:59:01,678
Let's just take a second.

1082
00:59:01,853 --> 00:59:03,787
Honestly?

1083
00:59:05,390 --> 00:59:07,950
Looks a little bit like the inside
of a down comforter.

1084
00:59:10,562 --> 00:59:12,052
What the hell's going on?

1085
00:59:12,230 --> 00:59:13,561
But look, no, the rhinest...

1086
00:59:13,732 --> 00:59:16,758
- It's beautiful, honestly...
- No. I'm not talking about the dress.

1087
00:59:16,935 --> 00:59:19,665
I'm talking about Ben.
An animated truck?

1088
00:59:19,838 --> 00:59:22,830
You know, I wrote seven pages
on how much I love and adore him...

1089
00:59:23,008 --> 00:59:27,911
...and all he can muster up for me is some
stupid Tonka truck in a three-ring circus?

1090
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:30,639
- That's it?
- Okay, you know what?

1091
00:59:31,316 --> 00:59:32,578
Lay it on me.

1092
00:59:32,751 --> 00:59:34,946
Oh, God.

1093
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:37,520
Please tell me everything's gonna be fine.

1094
00:59:38,490 --> 00:59:40,151
What do you want me to say?

1095
00:59:40,826 --> 00:59:43,124
Sadie, my marriage failed.

1096
00:59:43,762 --> 00:59:47,425
I watch <i>Titanic</i> by myself, alone,
in my room, every night...

1097
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:49,965
...stuffing my face
with Honey BBQ Fritos.

1098
00:59:50,836 --> 00:59:54,101
Not the one to give you any tips or advice
about your relationship...

1099
00:59:54,272 --> 00:59:56,604
...no matter how desperate you are.

1100
00:59:56,775 --> 00:59:58,242
Sorry.

1101
00:59:58,977 --> 01:00:05,007
However, I do recall my ex
never wrote any vows at all.

1102
01:00:05,350 --> 01:00:07,113
Really?

1103
01:00:08,019 --> 01:00:09,452
That's kind of promising.

1104
01:00:09,621 --> 01:00:10,610
Yeah.

1105
01:00:10,789 --> 01:00:12,916
It was probably because he was
too busy...

1106
01:00:13,091 --> 01:00:16,891
...sleeping with our dental hygienist,
which was great.

1107
01:00:17,729 --> 01:00:20,289
Hey, but your hygienist is a guy, right?

1108
01:00:20,465 --> 01:00:22,023
Yeah.

1109
01:00:23,034 --> 01:00:24,194
You're fine.

1110
01:00:38,283 --> 01:00:41,377
Is this a piece of work?
They don't make them like this any more.

1111
01:00:41,786 --> 01:00:43,276
When two people say "I do"...

1112
01:00:43,455 --> 01:00:46,322
...they're putting their lives
in each other's hands entirely.

1113
01:00:46,491 --> 01:00:48,959
Anything less than that
is doomed to failure.

1114
01:00:49,127 --> 01:00:51,254
Now, the last test you have to pass...

1115
01:00:51,429 --> 01:00:53,761
...before I certify you
ready for marriage...

1116
01:00:53,932 --> 01:00:56,059
...is the communication test.

1117
01:00:56,835 --> 01:00:58,462
Which is very important...

1118
01:00:58,637 --> 01:01:01,936
...given how poorly we've been doing
in that area lately.

1119
01:01:02,107 --> 01:01:03,199
Oh, me? Don't worry.

1120
01:01:03,375 --> 01:01:05,070
I plan on communicating very well...

1121
01:01:05,243 --> 01:01:08,474
Okay, Ben, can you please
just let him finish talking?

1122
01:01:08,647 --> 01:01:10,239
- Thank you.
- Yep.

1123
01:01:12,584 --> 01:01:14,916
- Sorry, reverend.
- It's okay.

1124
01:01:15,086 --> 01:01:18,681
To demonstrate how important
communication is in that area:

1125
01:01:20,458 --> 01:01:22,153
- What?
- Blindfold.

1126
01:01:23,228 --> 01:01:25,492
- What are you doing?
- I'm not doing anything.

1127
01:01:25,664 --> 01:01:28,155
You're gonna be Sadie's eyes
as she drives us.

1128
01:01:28,366 --> 01:01:31,824
- You're insane!
- lf you wanna pass this course...

1129
01:01:32,003 --> 01:01:34,597
...and get married tomorrow,
you have to pass this test.

1130
01:01:34,773 --> 01:01:35,933
Your call.

1131
01:01:36,107 --> 01:01:40,271
- Yeah. Yeah. I can do this.
- You<i>'</i>re actually gonna go through with this?

1132
01:01:40,979 --> 01:01:44,847
- What, Ben, you don't think I can do this?
- Okay. Maybe you don't understand...

1133
01:01:45,016 --> 01:01:46,142
...what's going on here.

1134
01:01:46,318 --> 01:01:48,582
Ben, there's two sets of controls.

1135
01:01:48,753 --> 01:01:50,778
I can take over at any time.

1136
01:01:52,791 --> 01:01:54,281
What'll it be, Benjamin?

1137
01:01:54,459 --> 01:01:55,653
Yeah.

1138
01:01:56,461 --> 01:01:58,656
Well, I'm gonna need
a little help here, though.

1139
01:01:58,830 --> 01:02:00,388
First you need to put it in gear.

1140
01:02:00,565 --> 01:02:02,465
- Check.
- And then you're gonna ease out...

1141
01:02:02,634 --> 01:02:03,862
...onto the street.

1142
01:02:07,839 --> 01:02:10,000
Left. Left!

1143
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:12,803
There you are. Right.
To the right!

1144
01:02:12,978 --> 01:02:15,208
Ben, did you see a clipboard back there?

1145
01:02:15,380 --> 01:02:17,371
There it is. Least it's warm.

1146
01:02:17,549 --> 01:02:19,380
- What...?
- It<i>'</i>s a communication exercise.

1147
01:02:19,551 --> 01:02:21,519
You will be graded.
Less than 80 percent...

1148
01:02:21,686 --> 01:02:23,517
...consider getting married in Vegas.

1149
01:02:23,688 --> 01:02:25,918
You know what?
Vegas sounds awesome right now.

1150
01:02:26,091 --> 01:02:28,525
Maybe you can get an
Elvis impersonator to officiate.

1151
01:02:28,693 --> 01:02:30,058
"Hey, my wife. Yeah."

1152
01:02:34,766 --> 01:02:37,894
- Ben, you wanna help your future bride?
- Yep, yep, yeah. I do, I do.

1153
01:02:38,069 --> 01:02:40,401
How about we take a right?
Head back to the church.

1154
01:02:40,572 --> 01:02:42,233
You might wanna brake.
Anytime.

1155
01:02:44,409 --> 01:02:46,707
Sorry. I'm sorry. I just, I got nervous.

1156
01:02:46,878 --> 01:02:49,608
That's very good.
Taking responsibility. Excellent, Sadie.

1157
01:02:49,781 --> 01:02:51,248
More enthusiasm
in the back, Ben.

1158
01:02:51,416 --> 01:02:54,749
Oh, my God, I'm having so much fun!
Aren<i>'</i>t you? I might pee my pants.

1159
01:02:54,919 --> 01:02:56,910
Sarcasm, wicked stepsister
of communication.

1160
01:02:57,088 --> 01:02:58,680
- Point off.
- Now take a right. Now.

1161
01:02:58,857 --> 01:03:00,324
- A right? Now?
- Now!

1162
01:03:02,627 --> 01:03:03,651
It's a one-way street!

1163
01:03:03,828 --> 01:03:05,523
Okay, well, then should I pull over?

1164
01:03:05,697 --> 01:03:08,063
No, no. Just go straight.
They'll go around you.

1165
01:03:08,233 --> 01:03:11,498
Oh, my... Jesus. Okay, okay.

1166
01:03:11,703 --> 01:03:16,504
- In about 20 yards we're gonna turn.
- 20 yards means nothing to me. I can<i>'</i>t see.

1167
01:03:16,675 --> 01:03:19,109
Here we go. Turning now!

1168
01:03:20,211 --> 01:03:23,578
There's a man.
That's an old man in a hat and a thing.

1169
01:03:23,748 --> 01:03:25,272
Look out!

1170
01:03:28,153 --> 01:03:30,815
- I'm blind, Ben!
- That's enough. We're ending this. Stop!

1171
01:03:30,989 --> 01:03:33,116
Is that what you do
when things get difficult?

1172
01:03:33,291 --> 01:03:34,758
You're just gonna quit?

1173
01:03:34,926 --> 01:03:36,359
I need to count on you, Ben.

1174
01:03:36,528 --> 01:03:39,929
Life will hand you stress
and the key to managing your anxiety...

1175
01:03:40,098 --> 01:03:43,431
...is not letting it contaminate your partner.
- Garbage truck!

1176
01:03:44,436 --> 01:03:45,596
- Where?
- Punch it!

1177
01:03:48,406 --> 01:03:49,771
Yeah!

1178
01:03:51,443 --> 01:03:53,843
I<i>'</i>m pretty sure I<i>'</i>m not learning
anything from this.

1179
01:03:54,012 --> 01:03:56,276
- Are we good? Are we good?
- There's Burt Fleeger!

1180
01:03:56,448 --> 01:03:57,938
Looking good, Hollywood!

1181
01:03:58,116 --> 01:04:02,052
- I feel like I'm not getting any guidance.
- You might wanna pick up speed a little.

1182
01:04:02,253 --> 01:04:05,620
- Wait, wait. Why would we do that?
- There's a parking space up there.

1183
01:04:05,790 --> 01:04:07,587
Gun it, Sadie.

1184
01:04:12,464 --> 01:04:14,329
- I never get this space!
- Oh, my God!

1185
01:04:14,499 --> 01:04:16,296
Perfect.

1186
01:04:18,169 --> 01:04:19,966
Hello, Jones family. How's it going?

1187
01:04:20,138 --> 01:04:21,662
Hello, reverend.

1188
01:04:22,107 --> 01:04:23,768
Daughter's a good little driver.

1189
01:04:27,145 --> 01:04:31,013
Well, you have the wedding processional.
You can go with Mendelssohn...

1190
01:04:31,182 --> 01:04:34,845
...or one couple actually had Captain and
Tennille here playing "Muskrat Love."

1191
01:04:35,019 --> 01:04:37,681
It's your call.
After you boogie down the aisle...

1192
01:04:37,856 --> 01:04:40,154
...l'll start by saying something nice.

1193
01:04:40,325 --> 01:04:43,351
Speaking of that, let's give a big
Saint Augustine welcome...

1194
01:04:43,528 --> 01:04:47,191
...to Ben Murphy's parents,
Ron and Mary Murphy.

1195
01:04:47,499 --> 01:04:48,966
Came all the way from Seattle.

1196
01:04:49,134 --> 01:04:53,264
Then I get into a brief message about
the joy and the sanctity of marriage...

1197
01:04:53,438 --> 01:04:56,202
...and that on your honeymoon,
try and act surprised.

1198
01:04:56,374 --> 01:04:58,137
It's an old joke, but sometimes works.

1199
01:04:58,309 --> 01:05:00,140
Then we got prayer, hymn, prayer, hymn.

1200
01:05:00,311 --> 01:05:03,109
And then we get into the vows.

1201
01:05:03,281 --> 01:05:06,114
In my course, the couple
writes their own vows.

1202
01:05:06,284 --> 01:05:08,115
And that in mind, may I have your vows?

1203
01:05:08,686 --> 01:05:10,711
Thank you.

1204
01:05:11,489 --> 01:05:13,286
Thank you.

1205
01:05:15,059 --> 01:05:16,356
- Ben?
- Yeah.

1206
01:05:16,528 --> 01:05:17,654
Got the vows?

1207
01:05:17,829 --> 01:05:19,729
Ben, where are your vows?

1208
01:05:20,098 --> 01:05:21,258
Oh, I have them. I just...

1209
01:05:21,432 --> 01:05:24,401
I haven't finished them, but I will
have them here tomorrow.

1210
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:28,563
Okey-dokey.
Well, I guess that'll have to do for now.

1211
01:05:28,740 --> 01:05:31,072
After the vows,
we have the lighting of the candle.

1212
01:05:31,242 --> 01:05:34,075
- It's true, by the way.
- Not now, Ben. I just wanna think.

1213
01:05:34,279 --> 01:05:35,405
Thinking's good.

1214
01:05:35,580 --> 01:05:37,878
- Yes, I wanna think about everything.
- What about?

1215
01:05:38,049 --> 01:05:40,142
I'm guessing these aren't
part of the vows.

1216
01:05:40,318 --> 01:05:45,756
Okay, because I used to think that we were
so perfectly compatible for each other...

1217
01:05:45,924 --> 01:05:47,755
...and now...

1218
01:05:48,326 --> 01:05:49,486
- Look at us, Ben.
- What?

1219
01:05:49,661 --> 01:05:53,256
- Ben, you want two kids, and I want four.
- So what?

1220
01:05:53,431 --> 01:05:56,628
You obviously think my family
is a bunch of rich, alcoholic snobs.

1221
01:05:56,801 --> 01:06:00,237
- You never take the lead on things, Ben!
- And I'm not good enough for you!

1222
01:06:00,438 --> 01:06:02,929
I'm not adventurous enough in bed, right?

1223
01:06:03,107 --> 01:06:05,632
And I'm not as handsome as Carlisle,
not as successful.

1224
01:06:05,810 --> 01:06:07,869
Carlisle has nothing to do with it.

1225
01:06:08,046 --> 01:06:10,537
- Carlisle has everything to do with it.
- How?

1226
01:06:10,715 --> 01:06:14,242
Because he is someone whose opinion
you trust way more than mine.

1227
01:06:14,419 --> 01:06:17,786
Oh, God. When have I
ever said that to you, Ben?

1228
01:06:17,956 --> 01:06:19,048
You just don't have to.

1229
01:06:19,290 --> 01:06:21,053
"Carlisle, what crystal should we use?

1230
01:06:21,226 --> 01:06:24,559
What brand of cheese is good, Carlisle?"

1231
01:06:24,729 --> 01:06:27,562
God, I am so sick of you
choosing Carlisle's cheese.

1232
01:06:27,732 --> 01:06:32,499
- Carlisle's cheese. Explore that, Ben.
- Enough of the pop psychology, reverend.

1233
01:06:32,670 --> 01:06:37,107
Because all you've done is everything
you can to make sure this doesn't work.

1234
01:06:37,275 --> 01:06:41,234
I've worked very hard to create lines
of communication between you and Sadie...

1235
01:06:41,412 --> 01:06:43,607
...to let you know what you're in for.

1236
01:06:43,781 --> 01:06:45,214
- You're onto it.
- Yeah, we are.

1237
01:06:45,383 --> 01:06:47,851
We are discovering
a whole shitload right now!

1238
01:06:48,019 --> 01:06:49,646
- Really?
- Yes, we are, Ben.

1239
01:06:49,854 --> 01:06:52,880
- Guys, seriously, space, please.
- Now's the time. Pop the info.

1240
01:06:53,057 --> 01:06:55,252
Okay. Okay. You know what?

1241
01:06:55,426 --> 01:06:57,894
I didn't wanna have to do this,
but I have no choice.

1242
01:06:58,062 --> 01:07:01,122
So aside from the fact that
Reverend Frank bugged our apartment...

1243
01:07:01,299 --> 01:07:02,357
Excuse me, what?

1244
01:07:02,533 --> 01:07:04,501
I've mounted an investigation.

1245
01:07:04,669 --> 01:07:07,263
One that I think you would be
interested to hear about.

1246
01:07:07,438 --> 01:07:11,067
So Frankie, should I tell them
or should you?

1247
01:07:12,443 --> 01:07:14,070
What do you want me to tell them?

1248
01:07:14,245 --> 01:07:17,180
What I want you to tell them
is what their good and decent...

1249
01:07:17,348 --> 01:07:21,682
...and ever-so-intuitive reverend
was doing when he married...

1250
01:07:21,853 --> 01:07:25,289
...and then subsequently divorced
one Maria Gonzales.

1251
01:07:26,424 --> 01:07:27,789
That's not true.

1252
01:07:27,959 --> 01:07:31,690
Reverend Frank has never been
married or divorced.

1253
01:07:32,530 --> 01:07:34,725
That's what I thought too,
Grandma Jones.

1254
01:07:34,899 --> 01:07:35,991
But...

1255
01:07:36,167 --> 01:07:37,156
...Reverend Frank?

1256
01:07:39,671 --> 01:07:41,002
It's true.

1257
01:07:41,172 --> 01:07:42,161
What?

1258
01:07:42,340 --> 01:07:43,398
Oh, it's very true.

1259
01:07:43,574 --> 01:07:46,509
How can we trust anything
he said to us now?

1260
01:07:46,678 --> 01:07:49,875
We have put our relationship
in the hands of a total hypocrite.

1261
01:07:51,849 --> 01:07:55,842
I didn't wanna have to talk about this
to protect certain parties...

1262
01:07:56,020 --> 01:07:58,989
...but enough time has passed
so the truth can finally be known.

1263
01:07:59,157 --> 01:08:00,419
Yes. Please do.

1264
01:08:00,591 --> 01:08:04,152
Several years ago, a young woman named
Maria Gonzales attended our church.

1265
01:08:04,929 --> 01:08:08,194
She was a refugee who was
denied political asylum.

1266
01:08:08,366 --> 01:08:12,962
If she was deported back to Guatemala,
she would have faced most certain death.

1267
01:08:13,137 --> 01:08:16,072
So in order for her and her children
to stay in this country...

1268
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:19,403
...I agreed to marry her
so she could get a green card.

1269
01:08:19,744 --> 01:08:22,679
Once she was legal, we divorced.

1270
01:08:22,847 --> 01:08:25,338
She moved to New Mexico with her kids.

1271
01:08:25,516 --> 01:08:28,576
A couple of years ago I got a letter
from her, and she told me...

1272
01:08:28,753 --> 01:08:32,211
...that her oldest
had been accepted to Harvard Law.

1273
01:08:32,690 --> 01:08:36,683
He was going to graduate
in the top of his class, and when he did...

1274
01:08:36,861 --> 01:08:39,091
...he was going to go
into immigration reform.

1275
01:08:39,263 --> 01:08:42,232
And that is the story of Maria Gonzales.

1276
01:08:43,701 --> 01:08:45,532
I keep their pictures in my wallet...

1277
01:08:48,573 --> 01:08:51,599
...to remind me that one person
can make a difference...

1278
01:08:51,776 --> 01:08:53,573
...even against insurmountable odds.

1279
01:08:55,213 --> 01:08:56,908
That's...
That's Pablo right there.

1280
01:08:57,081 --> 01:08:58,139
Ben.

1281
01:09:00,184 --> 01:09:05,121
If you had just spent half the amount
of time on your wedding vows...

1282
01:09:05,289 --> 01:09:08,690
...as this stupid little investigation...

1283
01:09:09,093 --> 01:09:12,028
...we would probably be walking
down the aisle tomorrow.

1284
01:09:12,196 --> 01:09:13,959
And, no, no...

1285
01:09:14,866 --> 01:09:16,731
I can't do it.

1286
01:09:22,907 --> 01:09:26,240
- Unbelievable.
- You're such a jerk.

1287
01:09:28,513 --> 01:09:29,639
Benjamin.

1288
01:09:31,416 --> 01:09:33,077
Are you happy now?

1289
01:09:34,018 --> 01:09:36,213
It's a painful process.

1290
01:09:36,387 --> 01:09:37,684
That's why we do it.

1291
01:09:37,855 --> 01:09:39,618
To find the truth, Benjamin.

1292
01:09:40,358 --> 01:09:41,382
Sometim...

1293
01:09:43,895 --> 01:09:47,262
Why did you punch the reverend?
What is wrong with you?

1294
01:09:48,533 --> 01:09:51,502
Nice right hook, but you are going to hell.
Know that?

1295
01:09:51,669 --> 01:09:53,694
I'm sorry. J.C., I'm sorry.

1296
01:09:56,474 --> 01:09:59,602
Three weeks.
That's a new course record.

1297
01:09:59,777 --> 01:10:03,440
Man, I haven't seen a right hook like that
since the Buffolini meltdown.

1298
01:10:03,614 --> 01:10:05,912
I hate this part.

1299
01:10:06,217 --> 01:10:08,481
I'll get the bag of frozen peas.
Come on.

1300
01:10:08,886 --> 01:10:10,376
Here we go.

1301
01:10:33,811 --> 01:10:35,210
Hi.

1302
01:10:36,647 --> 01:10:39,343
I can't believe I was about to marry
someone I didn't know.

1303
01:10:39,517 --> 01:10:41,644
That's why we have the course.

1304
01:10:41,819 --> 01:10:44,481
It's good that I found out now
instead of down the road...

1305
01:10:44,655 --> 01:10:47,055
...because that just
would have been awful.

1306
01:10:47,792 --> 01:10:50,283
I'm sorry, he just, he makes me so mad.

1307
01:10:50,928 --> 01:10:52,953
What am I supposed to do now?

1308
01:10:53,898 --> 01:10:56,093
- You still have your honeymoon tickets?
- Yeah.

1309
01:10:56,267 --> 01:10:57,359
Use them.

1310
01:10:57,535 --> 01:11:01,096
Go away for a couple of days.
Take a friend, family, anybody.

1311
01:11:02,039 --> 01:11:04,599
- I don't know.
- Oh, come on, it'll be great for you.

1312
01:11:05,243 --> 01:11:08,303
Get a tan, huh? Trust me.

1313
01:11:11,816 --> 01:11:13,613
See you, kiddo.

1314
01:11:14,986 --> 01:11:16,715
You know...

1315
01:11:17,221 --> 01:11:19,985
...maybe Ben wasn't the only...

1316
01:11:20,158 --> 01:11:21,182
No.

1317
01:11:21,359 --> 01:11:24,556
- No, no. What? What?
- No, have a great trip.

1318
01:11:31,536 --> 01:11:33,970
I mean, it wasn't supposed
to be like this.

1319
01:11:34,138 --> 01:11:36,436
Yeah, I feel as bad as you do.

1320
01:11:37,208 --> 01:11:40,405
Now she's using her honeymoon
ticket without me.

1321
01:11:40,711 --> 01:11:42,906
I mean, how is that supposed
to make me feel?

1322
01:11:43,814 --> 01:11:46,681
Bad. I think.

1323
01:11:48,219 --> 01:11:53,350
Three weeks ago, I was the happiest guy
in the world, and now I just...

1324
01:11:54,659 --> 01:11:56,286
Now I'm just sitting here with you.

1325
01:11:57,495 --> 01:12:00,692
Thanks.
Thanks, Ben. Appreciate that.

1326
01:12:00,865 --> 01:12:03,095
No, you know what I mean, I just...

1327
01:12:03,267 --> 01:12:04,700
Hey, it's cool.

1328
01:12:04,869 --> 01:12:09,897
Look, don't take this the wrong way,
because Sadie's cool, I like her a lot...

1329
01:12:10,074 --> 01:12:12,235
...but there are plenty of fish in the sea.

1330
01:12:12,410 --> 01:12:15,072
And now it's your time to be
the king barracuda...

1331
01:12:15,246 --> 01:12:18,010
...and get out there
and swim with the sweet tuna.

1332
01:12:18,182 --> 01:12:19,877
The ocean is yours, man.

1333
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:24,754
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

1334
01:12:26,390 --> 01:12:27,982
Okay.

1335
01:12:28,926 --> 01:12:30,450
You're a bear.

1336
01:12:30,628 --> 01:12:31,890
Now jump in that forest...

1337
01:12:32,063 --> 01:12:35,226
...and you gotta tag as many
cute, furry, bear butts as you can.

1338
01:12:35,399 --> 01:12:36,559
Joel...

1339
01:12:36,734 --> 01:12:38,998
...you're my best friend, man.
You know that?

1340
01:12:39,570 --> 01:12:42,471
- And I love you. You know that?
- I love you too.

1341
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:46,804
But you have got to be
the worst advice-giver I know.

1342
01:12:47,945 --> 01:12:50,971
I mean, not only is your
advice terrible, but...

1343
01:12:51,148 --> 01:12:54,174
...it just backfires at every turn.

1344
01:12:54,352 --> 01:12:57,879
And now you're talking to me
about fish and bears.

1345
01:12:58,055 --> 01:13:01,752
She's a woman, Joel.
I mean, she's an amazing woman.

1346
01:13:01,926 --> 01:13:04,224
And she's just so beautiful.

1347
01:13:04,395 --> 01:13:08,126
And she's loving and...

1348
01:13:08,366 --> 01:13:11,062
It was all right there...

1349
01:13:12,169 --> 01:13:14,034
...and I lost it.

1350
01:13:15,973 --> 01:13:20,171
And I don't need you telling me
that I should go out and find someone else.

1351
01:13:20,344 --> 01:13:24,144
I mean, I don't need anybody
telling me how to go...

1352
01:13:25,416 --> 01:13:27,680
I don't need anyone telling me.

1353
01:13:28,819 --> 01:13:30,480
Wait. Where you...
Ben! Hey!

1354
01:13:36,694 --> 01:13:38,855
No way.

1355
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:45,829
Whoa! Is that one strike
or two against Rodriguez?

1356
01:13:46,003 --> 01:13:47,027
Two.

1357
01:13:47,204 --> 01:13:49,502
Awesome job with the camouflage, guys.

1358
01:13:49,674 --> 01:13:50,868
Seriously, you got me.

1359
01:13:51,042 --> 01:13:54,205
Who'd have thought you'd be in a van
with "Saint Augustine's"?

1360
01:13:54,445 --> 01:13:55,912
Just listening to the ball game!

1361
01:13:57,014 --> 01:13:58,845
Cubs are off today.

1362
01:14:14,932 --> 01:14:16,058
Hey, Gillie.

1363
01:14:16,233 --> 01:14:19,134
This guy say he's in love.
He come to Jamaica to find his girl.

1364
01:14:19,303 --> 01:14:22,761
Well, see, we were supposed to get married
and then she just called it off.

1365
01:14:24,175 --> 01:14:26,643
Oh, no. It's a long story. Just...

1366
01:14:26,811 --> 01:14:28,938
Man, you don't have to worry,
it's a long ride.

1367
01:14:29,113 --> 01:14:32,241
It's really a long ride.
You can sit and tell us.

1368
01:14:32,416 --> 01:14:33,906
Well, what happened was...

1369
01:14:36,087 --> 01:14:39,716
It is absolutely beautiful here.

1370
01:14:40,658 --> 01:14:43,354
Hey, Mom, you gonna get in your bikini?

1371
01:14:43,527 --> 01:14:44,516
Like hell I will.

1372
01:14:52,903 --> 01:14:55,667
Talk to her. This is for lovers, man!

1373
01:14:56,006 --> 01:14:57,098
Thank you.

1374
01:15:12,623 --> 01:15:13,988
It's Ben.

1375
01:15:19,296 --> 01:15:20,786
- What?
- Sadie, it's me.

1376
01:15:20,965 --> 01:15:23,763
- I know. What do you want?
- Look, I have to talk to you.

1377
01:15:23,934 --> 01:15:25,458
Guess what, Ben?

1378
01:15:25,636 --> 01:15:29,538
You had your chance. You had an empty
book and you didn't say anything.

1379
01:15:29,707 --> 01:15:32,676
- And that's part of the thing. Listen...
- <i>No. Ben...</i>

1380
01:15:32,843 --> 01:15:35,835
...I don't wanna talk to you.
- You don't understand. I'm in...

1381
01:15:36,013 --> 01:15:37,605
Sadie?

1382
01:15:38,082 --> 01:15:41,074
How come I could say so much
and he couldn't say anything to me?

1383
01:15:41,252 --> 01:15:43,311
Can someone please explain that?

1384
01:15:48,893 --> 01:15:50,258
Sorry.

1385
01:15:50,428 --> 01:15:52,328
I was just clearing my throat.

1386
01:15:52,496 --> 01:15:54,191
- John!
- What?

1387
01:15:54,365 --> 01:15:56,629
A piece of coconut went down
the wrong way.

1388
01:15:56,801 --> 01:15:58,428
Your daughter's in pain.

1389
01:15:58,602 --> 01:16:01,400
- Yes, I'm in pain. And I'm all alone too.
- Not you.

1390
01:16:01,572 --> 01:16:03,563
- I'm alone.
- Not you.

1391
01:16:03,741 --> 01:16:07,108
Is anyone at all concerned
with the fact that my life is falling apart?

1392
01:16:07,278 --> 01:16:09,906
Oh, of course we are, sweetie.

1393
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:12,742
But relationships are complicated.

1394
01:16:12,917 --> 01:16:17,251
- We certainly don't have all the answers.
- You guys have been married for 30 years.

1395
01:16:17,421 --> 01:16:21,551
- You must be doing something right.
- Not all those years were great.

1396
01:16:21,725 --> 01:16:26,287
Years 16 through 18 in our marriage were
something straight out of <i>The Shining.</i>

1397
01:16:27,231 --> 01:16:30,758
Okay, but Ben and I couldn't even decide on
what color napkins we wanted...

1398
01:16:30,935 --> 01:16:32,664
...let alone how many kids.

1399
01:16:32,837 --> 01:16:35,567
And he couldn't handle that
I have a good guy friend.

1400
01:16:35,739 --> 01:16:39,004
I don't know if it's our friendship
he was insecure about.

1401
01:16:39,176 --> 01:16:40,939
Really?

1402
01:16:41,545 --> 01:16:43,445
Listen, I'm gonna support you here.

1403
01:16:43,614 --> 01:16:46,777
But you gotta think about this
from Ben's perspective.

1404
01:16:46,951 --> 01:16:49,749
How do you think he feels when you're
always coming to me?

1405
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:52,718
- I don<i>'</i>t go to you all the time.
- When are you going to him?

1406
01:16:53,858 --> 01:16:56,691
Just maybe...

1407
01:16:56,861 --> 01:16:59,694
...Ben wants to be with somebody
who needs him for a change.

1408
01:17:01,232 --> 01:17:02,790
That's really heartfelt.

1409
01:17:21,185 --> 01:17:23,415
- Does this happen all the time?
- Sadie?

1410
01:17:23,587 --> 01:17:26,385
To go from being so in love to this.

1411
01:17:26,557 --> 01:17:29,082
You know, I'm all alone
on my honeymoon at Sandals...

1412
01:17:29,260 --> 01:17:33,128
<i>... couples in love all over the place.</i>
<i>This isn't what I pictured.</i>

1413
01:17:33,297 --> 01:17:35,731
Well, is it ever what you picture?

1414
01:17:36,534 --> 01:17:39,298
Were we the first ones to fail the course?

1415
01:17:39,470 --> 01:17:43,099
Who said the course is over?
It's only over when you decide it's done.

1416
01:17:43,307 --> 01:17:45,434
I don't know what to do.

1417
01:17:46,010 --> 01:17:47,409
It'll come to you.

1418
01:17:47,578 --> 01:17:49,102
Have faith.

1419
01:17:50,748 --> 01:17:53,080
Thank you, Reverend Frank.

1420
01:17:55,119 --> 01:17:56,279
Right on schedule.

1421
01:17:56,453 --> 01:17:59,616
Hallelujah. Now do you mind?
I need my beauty sleep.

1422
01:17:59,790 --> 01:18:04,420
No smoking on this flight, but you
can light up whatever once we land.

1423
01:18:51,942 --> 01:18:53,773
- Ben?
- <i>Hey.</i>

1424
01:18:53,944 --> 01:18:55,912
<i>You picked up.</i>

1425
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:59,072
It's so weird.
I was just thinking about you.

1426
01:18:59,249 --> 01:19:00,807
<i>You were?</i>

1427
01:19:00,985 --> 01:19:02,612
Yeah.

1428
01:19:03,354 --> 01:19:07,450
My family said some things
to me yesterday about...

1429
01:19:07,625 --> 01:19:11,026
...me not relying on you and...

1430
01:19:12,496 --> 01:19:14,964
...it got me thinking...

1431
01:19:15,132 --> 01:19:17,225
...about that stupid truck...

1432
01:19:17,401 --> 01:19:19,392
...you drew in your wedding
vow notebook.

1433
01:19:19,570 --> 01:19:23,062
And I know this is gonna
sound so weird but...

1434
01:19:26,877 --> 01:19:29,402
...it's why I love you.

1435
01:19:29,980 --> 01:19:34,212
You don't always say the right things
or do the right things but somehow...

1436
01:19:35,185 --> 01:19:39,315
...I know you would jump through
a hoop of fire for me.

1437
01:19:40,324 --> 01:19:42,690
<i>Hey, can you do me a favor?</i>

1438
01:19:43,761 --> 01:19:47,925
<i>I think you should come to your window.</i>

1439
01:20:07,918 --> 01:20:10,478
I left my vow book at home so...

1440
01:20:10,654 --> 01:20:12,815
...I figured I should write
a few of them here.

1441
01:20:15,392 --> 01:20:16,484
What do you think?

1442
01:20:26,003 --> 01:20:28,062
- I am so sorry. I messed up.
- Me too.

1443
01:20:28,238 --> 01:20:30,399
There's so much to say.
I just didn't know how.

1444
01:20:30,574 --> 01:20:33,407
I need to stop doing everything myself
and share the reins.

1445
01:20:33,577 --> 01:20:35,977
No matter what I do,
I know you're gonna support me.

1446
01:20:36,146 --> 01:20:38,614
If I'm ever blindfolded,
you're the one to guide me.

1447
01:20:38,782 --> 01:20:41,148
I want to have as many kids
as we possibly can.

1448
01:20:41,318 --> 01:20:43,343
Really?
After Macy's, I definitely want two.

1449
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:45,044
I need to be more decisive.

1450
01:20:45,222 --> 01:20:47,656
- About napkins, about...
- Napkins, cheese, anything...

1451
01:20:47,825 --> 01:20:50,453
...at the end of the day,
I'm gonna rely on you.

1452
01:20:50,627 --> 01:20:53,721
Because nothing means
more to me than you.

1453
01:20:53,897 --> 01:20:56,798
Nothing. I love you.

1454
01:20:56,967 --> 01:20:58,832
I love you.

1455
01:21:06,543 --> 01:21:08,977
What's going on here?

1456
01:21:09,880 --> 01:21:13,714
Reverend Frank?
What are you doing here?

1457
01:21:14,351 --> 01:21:16,819
Reverend Frank is
everywhere, remember?

1458
01:21:16,987 --> 01:21:18,921
Thought you two broke up.

1459
01:21:19,089 --> 01:21:22,490
We did. We just sort of talked it through.

1460
01:21:22,659 --> 01:21:25,822
Seems like we have more faith
in each other than we thought.

1461
01:21:26,296 --> 01:21:27,285
Congratulations.

1462
01:21:27,464 --> 01:21:29,557
You just passed the course
with flying colors.

1463
01:21:30,868 --> 01:21:32,335
So how about it?

1464
01:21:32,503 --> 01:21:34,698
Do you think we should
get this wedding started?

1465
01:21:36,406 --> 01:21:37,532
I do.

1466
01:21:38,475 --> 01:21:41,137
And do you,
Benjamin Fitzpatrick Murphy...

1467
01:21:41,311 --> 01:21:46,408
...take Sadie Wilhelmina Jones
to be your lawfully wedded wife?

1468
01:21:46,583 --> 01:21:49,780
- I do.
- The rings.

1469
01:21:53,657 --> 01:21:55,716
"Never to fart"?

1470
01:21:55,893 --> 01:21:57,019
Oh, my God.

1471
01:21:57,194 --> 01:21:59,754
I didn't change it.
I'm gonna change it when I get back.

1472
01:21:59,930 --> 01:22:00,988
- I promise I will.
- No.

1473
01:22:01,165 --> 01:22:05,226
Bite your tongue, because I wouldn't want
it changed for anything in the whole world.

1474
01:22:05,402 --> 01:22:06,994
No.

1475
01:22:14,578 --> 01:22:16,102
Ready?

1476
01:22:18,081 --> 01:22:21,016
By the power vested in me by God...

1477
01:22:21,185 --> 01:22:26,213
...and the Minister of National Security
and Justice of Ocho Rios, Jamaica...

1478
01:22:26,390 --> 01:22:30,383
...I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

1479
01:23:10,567 --> 01:23:13,092
You gotta turn. There it is!

1480
01:23:26,850 --> 01:23:29,546
Frank, we just wanted to come
and thank you for everything.

1481
01:23:29,720 --> 01:23:32,245
- I'm just fulfilling my life's calling.
- You know what?

1482
01:23:32,422 --> 01:23:35,619
- We wouldn't have gotten here without you.
- Thanks.

1483
01:23:35,792 --> 01:23:38,317
You're gonna have a wonderful life.
I have no doubts.

1484
01:23:38,495 --> 01:23:42,261
Excuse me, may I borrow my daughter...
Your wife, for a dance?

1485
01:23:42,432 --> 01:23:44,127
- Yes, please.
- Thank you.

1486
01:23:44,301 --> 01:23:46,701
- Bye.
- You look beautiful.

1487
01:23:46,870 --> 01:23:48,394
Hey, can I ask you a question?

1488
01:23:48,572 --> 01:23:49,630
Sure.

1489
01:23:49,806 --> 01:23:52,331
When did you know that we were
ready to get married?

1490
01:23:52,509 --> 01:23:57,105
The moment you told Joel that Sadie wasn't
a fish, I knew it was meant to be.

1491
01:23:57,281 --> 01:24:00,444
Besides, anybody who kicks
a reverend's ass for his woman...

1492
01:24:00,617 --> 01:24:02,016
...you're A-okay in my book.

1493
01:24:02,185 --> 01:24:03,243
Well...

1494
01:24:04,021 --> 01:24:06,990
You're starting an incredible journey
with a wonderful partner.

1495
01:24:07,157 --> 01:24:08,317
Thank you.

1496
01:24:08,492 --> 01:24:11,984
And on the honeymoon, act surprised.

1497
01:24:12,162 --> 01:24:13,493
I will.

1498
01:24:13,664 --> 01:24:16,531
- Take care of yourself, B.
- You too, Frank.

1499
01:24:26,343 --> 01:24:28,334
Oh, my God.

1500
01:24:33,216 --> 01:24:35,912
- Wait.
- No, that's what they're supposed to do.

1501
01:24:36,086 --> 01:24:39,852
I know. I lost... We broke...

1502
01:24:40,023 --> 01:24:41,820
But it's okay if we laugh, right?

1503
01:24:41,992 --> 01:24:43,550
It's not okay if we laugh, is it?

1504
01:24:46,930 --> 01:24:49,023
- You broke!
- I did not.

1505
01:24:49,633 --> 01:24:51,726
We still got a siren. My ride's here.

1506
01:24:51,902 --> 01:24:55,201
I like shooting downtown L.A.,
because pretty much you got 911 all day.

1507
01:24:55,372 --> 01:24:56,361
I'll be over here.

1508
01:25:00,344 --> 01:25:04,337
Whoa!
"Be chill, don't kill."

1509
01:25:04,514 --> 01:25:07,483
That goes for you too, Mr. Simpson.
Okay.

1510
01:25:10,754 --> 01:25:12,346
I thought you'd work so hard!

1511
01:25:13,657 --> 01:25:16,922
Just get me a bottle of water
and a rubber mallet.

1512
01:25:22,699 --> 01:25:26,601
Come on.
Thrust it, thrust it, thrust it!

1513
01:25:28,472 --> 01:25:31,908
People, we can do this.
They're not that...

1514
01:25:32,075 --> 01:25:33,804
Ben?

1515
01:25:37,581 --> 01:25:42,018
Help out, everybody.
Motherf* * * er.

1516
01:25:42,519 --> 01:25:44,783
You play cutch?

1517
01:25:44,955 --> 01:25:45,944
"Cutch."

1518
01:25:46,123 --> 01:25:49,581
Let me walk back and cutch,
which is a old game.

1519
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:51,921
That's scary that I could
say it like that...

1520
01:25:52,429 --> 01:25:54,124
Oh, my God.

1521
01:25:55,132 --> 01:25:56,997
No. Stop.

1522
01:26:00,237 --> 01:26:03,138
I'm gonna look like such a rookie,
because every time...

1523
01:26:03,974 --> 01:26:05,635
Cut.

1524
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:11,445
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
