1
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,453
I'm gonna play it again.

2
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:17,690
You play that thing one more time,
I'm gonna melt it down into hair spray.

3
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:19,356
Let me play
the other side then.

4
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:22,367
No, Rayette,
it's not a question of sides.

5
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:25,563
It's a question
of musical integrity.

6
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:28,334
<i>Then let me sing one for ya.
When there's a...</i>

7
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:30,137
Hold it, hold it.

8
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,372
- Oh, Bobby!
- What?

9
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:35,004
Quit that now.

10
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:37,015
You said you're gonna help me
pick a song.

11
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:39,881
- I did?
- I'm gonna cut off your damn water.

12
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:42,183
I swear.

13
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:49,057
Selfish.

14
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:50,561
You can play on the piano.

15
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:54,862
Your whole damn family can play
some type of musical instrument.

16
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:58,768
All I'm askin' is for you
to help me improve my musical talent.

17
00:03:58,838 --> 00:04:02,001
And you'd think you would.

18
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:05,169
Dipesto, why don't you
take that sign off your tit...

19
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:08,681
and you and me go out
and have us a real good time.

20
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,017
Where are we going?

21
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:17,183
I don't know, but I'll holler up
to Elton and Stoney.

22
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,860
Bobby, now listen a minute.

23
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:27,458
You know, I'II go out with you...

24
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:30,764
<i>or I'll stay in with you...</i>

25
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:34,796
or I'll do anything
that you'd like for me to do...

26
00:04:34,874 --> 00:04:37,707
if you would tell me
that you love me.

27
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:41,546
You can sing the song.

28
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:53,057
You are never satisfied.

29
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:57,562
That's right.

30
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,134
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

31
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:15,241
All right, here it is.

32
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:25,090
They were all set up right for ya.

33
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,285
Get right in there, Dipesto.

34
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,488
- Just relax.
- Come on, Rayette.

35
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:32,997
Watch that left foot.
Left foot forward.

36
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:44,400
Not too much of a match,
is it, Elton?

37
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:50,647
In the gutter.
Isn't that wonderful?

38
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:53,185
Too heavy for me, honey.

39
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:55,880
The pins, you know. I can't see them.
I can't make 'em out.

40
00:05:55,955 --> 00:05:57,547
Squint. I squint.

41
00:05:57,623 --> 00:06:00,956
There they are at the end
of these little boards.

42
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,689
You notice 'em leading down,
just spot and follow through.

43
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:04,855
But there's so many.

44
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:07,058
- What's that for?
- That's for luck.

45
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:09,067
- Oh, you're crazy.
- Go show Ray how to do it.

46
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:12,366
- You slobbered on me.
- It ain't the first time.

47
00:06:12,438 --> 00:06:15,100
Watch this.

48
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:18,541
There she is. She's doin'
a little variation on the Apache Shift.

49
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:19,543
I taught her that.

50
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:25,975
- Are you mad at me?
- No, I'm not mad at ya, honey.

51
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,644
It'll be all right.

52
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,247
- Look at me and tell me you're not mad.
- I'm not mad at you.

53
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:38,255
- Let's see you beat it.
- I'll show you how it gets done.

54
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:39,923
Don't talk about it. Do it.

55
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:41,091
Isn't he pretty?

56
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:56,281
Show me something.
Give me spirit. Give me something.

57
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,983
That stupid thing
just goes all cocky-wobbly, honey.

58
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:08,993
- Just do what I tell ya.
- I did, didn't I, EI?

59
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:10,221
You got another ball coming.

60
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:17,134
- Come on!
- Relax, Ray. That's all.

61
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:22,439
Attaboy!

62
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:28,942
That was real good, wasn't it?
I finally did it.

63
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:32,542
Great. You throw the big Zs
for 19 frames...

64
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:36,520
and then you throw a strike
on the last ball of a losin' game.

65
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:40,252
Just wonderful.
Wasn't that wonderful, ladies?

66
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:43,261
- Are you talking to us?
- Wonderful.

67
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,429
I guess I'll go wait in the car.

68
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,934
Why don't you go wait in the car?

69
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:52,493
I will.
I'll wait there right now.

70
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:54,802
One minute, honey,
and I'll go with you.

71
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:05,645
Me and Stoney got to get on home,
relieve the sitter.

72
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:09,085
Why don't you and Ray
just come on by the place?

73
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,419
All right, why don't you go on?

74
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:15,291
Here, I'll take care
of the beers.

75
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:17,989
And would you walk Rayette
with ya?

76
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:19,998
- Sure.
- Thanks.

77
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,014
- What do we owe you?
- Four dollars, sir.

78
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:44,681
Okay.

79
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:50,428
- Here's a five. Thanks very much.
- Thank you.

80
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:57,196
We've been wanting to ask you.

81
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:00,068
You're on the TV, aren't ya?

82
00:09:01,173 --> 00:09:02,765
Am I?

83
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:08,280
She says you're the guy
that sells all the cars on TV.

84
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,009
I might have sold a few cars.

85
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:16,953
I told ya! My name's Shirley,
but they call me Betty.

86
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:19,719
Her name's Twinky.

87
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:22,727
- Twinky?
- Yeah, 'cause she's so Twinky.

88
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:26,764
Boy, oh, boy.
Well, Betty and Twinky...

89
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:29,892
it sure is nice
talking to you girls.

90
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:32,062
I wish I had some more time.

91
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:34,538
- That's a wig you wear, isn't it?
- Me?

92
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:37,167
Yeah, I told her it was you,
but that you're wearing a wig...

93
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:41,805
'cause on TV,
you're mostly all bald up there.

94
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:47,078
Your friend's real, real sharp.

95
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:50,520
I don't wear the wig on TV...

96
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,923
<i>because if you're gonna be in front of
two and a half million people...</i>

97
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:56,086
you've got to be sincere.

98
00:09:56,162 --> 00:10:00,189
I mean, I like to wear it when I'm in
bowling alleys and slipping around.

99
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,632
I think it gives me a little class.
What do you think?

100
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:07,036
Yeah, but I can see
a little bit of the net up there.

101
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,199
That's what give it away.

102
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,209
A little net.

103
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:15,547
I wish I had more time
to talk to you girls...

104
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,448
but I have to...

105
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:20,144
I'Il...

106
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,464
Come on, Ray.
We're gonna go over to Elton's.

107
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:36,831
I'm not.

108
00:10:36,902 --> 00:10:39,234
You're just gonna sit here?

109
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,500
Yes.

110
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:45,101
Okay, I hope
no one hits on you.

111
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:47,111
I hope they do.

112
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,479
Okay.

113
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,484
See you later.

114
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:22,447
No one would want to hit on you.
You look too pathetic.

115
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:28,078
Come on, Dipesto.
We can still have a good time.

116
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:32,514
You're the pathetic one,
not me.

117
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:36,586
I'm going over to Elton's.

118
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,961
I am not a piece of crap.

119
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:51,536
I'm sorry.

120
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:54,044
You treat me like I was.

121
00:11:56,649 --> 00:12:01,882
Go slip around
right before my face...

122
00:12:01,954 --> 00:12:05,048
in front of Elton and Stoney
that way.

123
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:10,358
What do you imagine they think
of somebody you treat like that?

124
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:12,363
Now, now, Ray.

125
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:21,406
Sweetheart, Elton and Stoney know
that I love you.

126
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:25,274
They're just gonna think that I'm not
too nice a guy, which I'm not...

127
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:29,007
and that you're a real hell of
a good person for puttin' up with me.

128
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,515
That's all.

129
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:34,018
Just find me dead one time.

130
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:38,248
You'll just kill me.

131
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:43,354
Come on, be a good girl.

132
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:48,190
<i>If you ever really get up
and leave me...</i>

133
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,735
you'll read about it
in the newsprint.

134
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:53,704
I'm not gonna get up
and leave you.

135
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:02,046
Now, come on.

136
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:04,878
Let's go over to Elton's
and have a good time.

137
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,879
You love me, Bobby?

138
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:14,459
What do you think?

139
00:13:53,532 --> 00:13:54,624
Fuck.

140
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:58,166
You got banana on your face.

141
00:13:58,237 --> 00:14:00,171
I do?

142
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:06,637
I still ain't figured out
how you got me workin' back out here.

143
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,110
I got you to work out here?

144
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:14,050
I ain't figured out how you let me
get you to work on these rigs.

145
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:18,055
I've never worked on these before.
You've worked on 'em before.

146
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:21,615
I can't figure out
how you let me get us out here.

147
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,628
Somebody had to look out for ya.

148
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:27,324
You're a mess.

149
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:31,328
You're crazy.

150
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:51,652
- I'm gonna bet two dollars right off.
- I'm in.

151
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,692
I think you're bullshitting me.

152
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:56,353
- What have you got?
- Pair of nines.

153
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:59,158
- Can you beat two pair?
- There's three aces right there.

154
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,198
I got me a hand.

155
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:06,397
It's time for me to go home.
See you in the mornin'.

156
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:07,734
See you in the morning.

157
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:11,242
I don't know if I'm goin' out there
tomorrow at all.

158
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:15,576
I got a lot of money
tied up in everything I've got.

159
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:20,079
I don't want no chains
going around and all this.

160
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:22,120
It's all right,
but I prefer cardplaying.

161
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:25,020
Where is it? What the hell is going on
in the middle of this game?

162
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,684
People talking and all.
We got money here or what?

163
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,126
<i>Ride a cockhorse
to Banbury Cross</i>

164
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:33,756
<i>To Banbury Cross
we go</i>

165
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:39,127
When I was four...
just four years old...

166
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:41,434
I went to my mother...

167
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:43,498
and I said,
"What's this hole in my chin?"

168
00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:46,806
I saw this dimple in my chin
and didn't know what it was.

169
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:49,006
Get what my mother says.

170
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:52,448
She says, "When you're born,
you go on an assembly line past God.

171
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:55,214
If He likes you,
He says, 'You cute little thing'...

172
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,379
and you get dimples there.

173
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:59,720
If He doesn't like you,
He goes, 'Go away."'

174
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:04,456
So, about six months later,
my mother caught me saying my prayers.

175
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:06,998
I was going, "Now I lay me
down to sleep."

176
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:10,160
Mother says, "What are you
covering up your chin for?"

177
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:15,673
And I said, "Because if I cover up
the hole, maybe He'll listen to me."

178
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:56,577
I look unfit to you, Elton?
I'm fit!

179
00:16:56,648 --> 00:17:02,484
<i>If you haven't got your ticket yet
you'd better order it</i>

180
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:05,352
<i>He'll wet your carpet
and he'll fertilize your grass</i>

181
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:10,760
<i>He's got three white feet
and a hole in his ass</i>

182
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:15,098
Don't you know no songs
about women or nothin'?

183
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:19,769
Yeah, but I'm just too loaded
to think of 'em now.

184
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:20,539
Watch out for all this traffic.

185
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,867
Watch out for all this traffic.

186
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:25,034
- Oh, God.
- I ain't in no hurry.

187
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:29,979
Believe starting off your day
like this, going to work?

188
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,483
Unbelievable.
Let me have a drink, will ya?

189
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,611
Thanks, EI.

190
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:40,558
Oh, boy, that's tough
in the morning.

191
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:44,628
What the hell
are these people doing here?

192
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:51,829
Isn't this some goddamn thing?

193
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,838
Jesus Christ!

194
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:03,847
I can't stand this goddamn freeway.

195
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:10,988
I heard ya! Why don't you
flash your lights...

196
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:14,184
so we can see
what else you got for Christmas?

197
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:19,255
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

198
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:21,629
Where you going?

199
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:29,837
Why don't we all line up
like a goddamn bunch of ants...

200
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:32,934
in the most beautiful part
of the day!

201
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:47,090
Hey, get off my car.

202
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:19,848
0h, shit. What's he doing?

203
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:48,583
Play it!

204
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:57,687
Quit foolin' around!
Come on!

205
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:02,260
Bobby, he's turning!

206
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:06,070
Will you hold your horses?

207
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:53,475
I was with Elton
last night, Rayette.

208
00:21:53,545 --> 00:21:55,479
It's the truth.

209
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,774
You son of a bitch.

210
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:54,934
Natalie, be quiet.
Come on, reach for it.

211
00:22:55,006 --> 00:22:58,134
Come on. Good girl.

212
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:14,388
- Isn't he sweet?
- I can't see the set.

213
00:23:14,459 --> 00:23:18,122
You take him for a while.
Go ahead now.

214
00:23:18,196 --> 00:23:19,891
How ya doin'?

215
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,564
You ought to get yourself
one of them little things.

216
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:35,837
That's it. He crushed that one too.
Then I won't get any.

217
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:38,610
<i>Bless my soul.
It's a new harmonica.</i>

218
00:23:38,683 --> 00:23:41,174
<i>- That's for your birthday.
- My birthday?</i>

219
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:43,915
<i>How do you know when my birthday is?</i>

220
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:45,923
<i>I don't know myself.</i>

221
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:51,862
The kitchen's on fire, Stoney.

222
00:23:54,332 --> 00:23:56,664
Your mother's just died.

223
00:23:56,735 --> 00:23:59,169
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

224
00:23:59,237 --> 00:24:01,171
- Bye.
- See ya, Elton.

225
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:04,475
So long.

226
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:06,534
<i>Incidentally,
what's his name?</i>

227
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:09,944
You just love that little baby,
don't you?

228
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:14,149
Well, what if she was?

229
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:17,313
I can't see nothing
so bad in that.

230
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:21,416
Well, what if I were to let you in
on a little secret that she is?

231
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:23,886
That's right.

232
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:26,226
She told me.

233
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:29,324
She's all torn up about it, too,
which I hate to see.

234
00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:33,571
Isn't it something
you just have to face up to?

235
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:37,802
I'll tell ya, somewhere along the line,
you even get to likin' the whole idea.

236
00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:41,107
When Stoney first give me the news,
I could've shit.

237
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:48,815
Well, isn't that nice?

238
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:50,320
It's ridiculous.

239
00:24:50,388 --> 00:24:54,290
I'm listening to some cracker asshole
who lives in a trailer park...

240
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:56,293
compare his life to mine.

241
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:04,493
Keep on telling me about the good life,
because it makes me puke.

242
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:09,268
If you're saying you're something
better than I am, that's something else.

243
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:11,172
But I can't say much of someone...

244
00:25:11,243 --> 00:25:13,575
who could leave a woman
in a situation like this...

245
00:25:13,645 --> 00:25:15,237
and feel easy about it.

246
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:16,610
That's all I have to say.

247
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:18,615
I'm glad that's all
you got to say...

248
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:21,174
because I'm about
as goddamn tired of your mouth...

249
00:25:21,253 --> 00:25:24,222
as I am working
on the goddamn job!

250
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,295
Shit ass!

251
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,307
Hey, Longcipher!

252
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:55,310
I'm quitting.

253
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:58,220
Do you hear me?
I said I'm quitting.

254
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:00,554
I don't give a damn
what you do.

255
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:03,526
I'm glad to get rid
of both of you dumb guys.

256
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:22,342
Hey, what's going on?

257
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:40,894
Don't do that, Bob.
Don't mix in.

258
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:44,129
They've got the right, Bob.
It's the law.

259
00:27:04,723 --> 00:27:06,850
Don't you think
you could just leave him?

260
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:10,588
If he had known who you were,
he wouldn't have done that. Would you?

261
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:12,926
What the hell's going on?

262
00:27:12,998 --> 00:27:14,829
All right, let him go.

263
00:27:16,668 --> 00:27:18,602
What's going on?

264
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:23,403
I got accused of robbing
a filling station. Didn't I tell ya?

265
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:26,467
I just got wild
and jumped my bail.

266
00:27:26,544 --> 00:27:30,810
They come runnin' at me a whole year
later. Isn't that something?

267
00:27:33,551 --> 00:27:35,348
Tell Stoney for me, ya hear?

268
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:53,892
Hi. Miss Dupea?

269
00:28:53,965 --> 00:28:56,331
- Upstairs. Up those stairs.
- Thank you.

270
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:47,451
There she goes again.

271
00:29:48,853 --> 00:29:51,754
My one-year-old can carry a tune
better than that.

272
00:29:58,329 --> 00:29:59,762
Miss Dupea.

273
00:30:03,268 --> 00:30:07,329
- Miss Dupea.
- Yes?

274
00:30:07,405 --> 00:30:10,374
I'd like to remind you again
that this is not an opera...

275
00:30:10,441 --> 00:30:12,409
or a musical comedy.

276
00:30:15,213 --> 00:30:17,511
Sorry. Was I singing again?

277
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:20,016
If you want to call it that.

278
00:30:20,084 --> 00:30:22,109
Wait. You have simply to tell me.

279
00:30:22,187 --> 00:30:23,950
That's all.

280
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:26,115
That's exactly
what I am doing again.

281
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:29,558
Must you let me get two thirds
of the way through the movement?

282
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:34,360
- This is tiring me.
- I have another suggestion.

283
00:30:34,432 --> 00:30:37,196
- Why don't we take a break?
- For pity's sake.

284
00:30:37,268 --> 00:30:40,635
- Is she gonna cry again?
- I don't wanna take a break.

285
00:30:40,705 --> 00:30:45,005
Some coffee. What would you like
in your coffee, Miss Dupea?

286
00:30:45,076 --> 00:30:47,567
- Tea.
- One tea.

287
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:49,579
Tell her Bobby's here.

288
00:30:49,647 --> 00:30:51,239
Bobby's here.

289
00:30:54,886 --> 00:30:56,820
Oh, my goodness!

290
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:02,587
Robert Eroica.

291
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,638
I can't look at you.

292
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:17,641
Well, don't, then.

293
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:24,412
You always do this to me.

294
00:31:24,482 --> 00:31:27,212
I don't mean to.
Here's your tea, Tita.

295
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:30,618
Thank you.
Don't put it there.

296
00:31:30,688 --> 00:31:32,952
Why? What's wrong?

297
00:31:33,024 --> 00:31:36,721
This is a very special CB 275.

298
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:40,059
No kidding.

299
00:31:40,131 --> 00:31:44,568
It has absolutely
no objectionable idiosyncrasies.

300
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:55,245
I have to talk seriously to you.

301
00:31:55,313 --> 00:31:58,407
Everybody still living
up on the island?

302
00:31:58,483 --> 00:32:01,919
Well, at the moment,
there's really just...

303
00:32:01,986 --> 00:32:06,184
Daddy, Carl and myself,
and Van Oost.

304
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:07,952
- Who's Van Oost?
- Catherine.

305
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:11,257
She's a pianist.
She's working with Carl.

306
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:13,923
Carl's a fiddler.
What's he doing coaching piano?

307
00:32:13,998 --> 00:32:16,466
Well, eleven months ago...

308
00:32:16,534 --> 00:32:21,233
<i>he was on his bicycle on his way
to the post office in the village...</i>

309
00:32:21,306 --> 00:32:25,436
and he ran straight into a jeep
and sprained his neck.

310
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:28,035
Strained his neck?

311
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:31,673
That's not funny.
He permanently sprained his neck.

312
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:37,051
Since then, it's been extremely painful
for him to tuck the violin...

313
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:40,056
Crashes into a jeep
and totals his neck.

314
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:50,795
I have to tell you.

315
00:32:52,036 --> 00:32:53,970
Daddy's very ill.

316
00:33:02,547 --> 00:33:05,414
- What?
- He's had two strokes.

317
00:33:11,956 --> 00:33:13,890
He's not...

318
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,622
They feel, maybe,
he might not recover from it.

319
00:33:18,696 --> 00:33:20,630
Don't tell me about this.

320
00:33:26,237 --> 00:33:31,402
But don't you think it's right
that you should see him at least once?

321
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:34,912
<i>- Miss Dupea.
- Just a minute, please.</i>

322
00:33:34,979 --> 00:33:37,277
Don't you think it's right
you should see him?

323
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:39,282
Yeah, I guess so.

324
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:42,513
I'm going back up tonight.
Will you come with me?

325
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:47,420
I'd rather drive up.

326
00:33:47,492 --> 00:33:49,960
Maybe I'll go
into Canada after.

327
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:55,363
I'm not gonna stay long.
One week at the most.

328
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:57,367
I know.

329
00:34:00,938 --> 00:34:02,872
Well...

330
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:07,135
Come on.
I'll walk you out.

331
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,914
I'll be back
in two minutes.

332
00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:12,950
<i>We've had our break, Miss Dupea.</i>

333
00:34:13,017 --> 00:34:16,714
- They hate me, I feel.
- Maybe you better stay.

334
00:34:18,923 --> 00:34:22,654
I want to talk to you
about so many things.

335
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:24,991
I'll be seeing you
in a couple of days.

336
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:29,022
I'm so glad.

337
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,034
Me too.

338
00:34:31,769 --> 00:34:33,703
Bye.

339
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,775
Hello?

340
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,950
You got the day off?

341
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:40,864
Are you sick?

342
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,140
Guess you heard
about Elton.

343
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:57,640
Okay, I got your point.
I hope you didn't strain yourself...

344
00:36:57,715 --> 00:37:00,149
getting in here
before I hit the back door.

345
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:09,323
I have to go home.

346
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:11,327
My father's sick.

347
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:20,236
I'll be gone
for two or three weeks.

348
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:24,037
You'll be gone period.

349
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:42,692
I'll try and call you
from up there.

350
00:37:56,073 --> 00:37:57,836
Come on, Dipesto.

351
00:37:57,908 --> 00:38:00,877
I never told you
it would work out to anything.

352
00:38:02,747 --> 00:38:04,681
Did I?

353
00:38:08,986 --> 00:38:11,614
I'll send you some money.
That's all I can do.

354
00:38:15,693 --> 00:38:18,127
I'II try and call you
from up there.

355
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:24,801
Bye, Ray.

356
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:15,644
You wanna go with me?

357
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:11,436
<i>There's been hot spells
and cold spells ever since we've met</i>

358
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:14,239
<i>I've seen your big fires
your small fires</i>

359
00:40:14,311 --> 00:40:16,108
<i>But I won't give up yet</i>

360
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:18,705
<i>Oh, someday you'll yearn</i>

361
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:21,581
<i>'Cause your heart's gonna burn</i>

362
00:40:21,652 --> 00:40:26,180
<i>For that old familiar glow</i>

363
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:27,690
<i>You'll be first</i>

364
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:30,818
- Like it?
- I love it.

365
00:40:31,962 --> 00:40:34,829
<i>You'll be burned out
or smoked out</i>

366
00:40:34,899 --> 00:40:38,767
<i>And come back to me
I know</i>

367
00:40:38,836 --> 00:40:43,034
- What the hell are they doing?
- Is that an accident?

368
00:40:47,311 --> 00:40:50,678
Who was driving?
You were driving!

369
00:40:50,748 --> 00:40:52,010
What's going on?

370
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:54,481
Rotate, mack!

371
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,245
Look at my car.

372
00:40:59,323 --> 00:41:02,759
I just bought it brand-new from a used
car lot, and the steering goes to pot.

373
00:41:02,827 --> 00:41:05,261
- You're lucky nobody was hurt.
- Can you give us a lift?

374
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:06,762
Come on, Terry!
We got a ride!

375
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:09,629
You're gonna give those people
a lift?

376
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:14,296
- I can't just leave them here.
- I'd like to punch that son of a bitch.

377
00:41:14,371 --> 00:41:17,135
Jesus. What a rude person.

378
00:41:20,377 --> 00:41:23,312
- What's your name?
- Palm Apodaca.

379
00:41:25,382 --> 00:41:27,976
- What's your name?
- Terry Grouse.

380
00:41:30,054 --> 00:41:31,783
What?

381
00:41:31,856 --> 00:41:34,154
How far are you going?

382
00:41:34,225 --> 00:41:36,489
Washington.

383
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:40,326
We'll get off in Washington.
We'll hook a ride.

384
00:41:40,397 --> 00:41:43,992
- Where are you going?
- Alaska.

385
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:47,560
Alaska?
What, are you on vacation?

386
00:41:47,638 --> 00:41:50,402
She wants to live there
because it's cleaner.

387
00:41:50,474 --> 00:41:52,908
Cleaner?
Cleaner than what?

388
00:41:54,745 --> 00:41:56,440
You don't have to tell everybody.

389
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:59,347
Soon, they'll all go,
and it won't be so clean.

390
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,782
What makes you think it's cleaner?

391
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:07,017
I saw a picture of it.
Alaska's very clean.

392
00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:10,254
It appeared to look
very white to me.

393
00:42:10,327 --> 00:42:12,454
Don't you think?

394
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:16,660
Yep. That was before
the big thaw.

395
00:42:16,734 --> 00:42:18,167
Before the what?

396
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:39,348
I had to leave this place because
I got depressed seeing all the crap.

397
00:42:40,457 --> 00:42:42,448
The thing is,
they're making more crap.

398
00:42:42,526 --> 00:42:45,359
They got so many stores
and stuff and junk full of crap.

399
00:42:45,429 --> 00:42:48,057
- I can't believe it.
- Who?

400
00:42:48,132 --> 00:42:52,228
Who?
Man, that's who.

401
00:42:52,303 --> 00:42:54,737
Pretty soon, there won't be
any room for man.

402
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:59,906
They're selling more crap that
people buy than you can imagine.

403
00:42:59,977 --> 00:43:01,410
Crap.

404
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,905
I believe everybody should have
a big hole...

405
00:43:04,982 --> 00:43:06,745
where they throw the stuff in
and burn it.

406
00:43:06,817 --> 00:43:09,877
They'd never find a hole
big enough. Never.

407
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:11,751
Take me. Look at me.

408
00:43:11,822 --> 00:43:15,588
When I was just one person,
before I was with Bobby...

409
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:19,117
I was collecting onto me more garbage
every day...

410
00:43:19,196 --> 00:43:22,495
till I was gettin' to thinkin'
that I should get a disposal.

411
00:43:22,566 --> 00:43:25,467
Disposal?
What's that, but more crap?

412
00:43:25,536 --> 00:43:27,595
I've never seen such crap.

413
00:43:27,671 --> 00:43:32,040
- Mass production is what does it.
- Mass? You're not that clean either.

414
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:34,771
Wait. I'm not that neat,
but I am clean.

415
00:43:34,845 --> 00:43:38,679
You're not that bad.
But some people.

416
00:43:38,749 --> 00:43:42,207
People's homes, just filth.
I've been in people's homes...

417
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:45,778
In my personal observation,
more people are neat than clean.

418
00:43:45,856 --> 00:43:47,289
I don't see that.

419
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:50,919
I'm seeing more filth.
A lot of filth.

420
00:43:50,995 --> 00:43:53,520
What they need to do every day,
no, once in a while...

421
00:43:53,597 --> 00:43:56,862
is do a cockroach thing
where they spray the homes.

422
00:43:56,934 --> 00:43:59,129
<i>Imagine if their doors
were painted a pretty color...</i>

423
00:43:59,203 --> 00:44:00,636
and they had a pot outside.

424
00:44:00,704 --> 00:44:03,036
- Yeah, could be adorable.
- And they picked up.

425
00:44:03,107 --> 00:44:07,908
Then it wouldn't be filthy
with Coke bottles and whiskey and...

426
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:09,912
those signs everywhere,
they should be erased!

427
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:12,972
All those signs selling you crap
and more crap and more crap.

428
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:16,884
I don't know.
I don't even want to talk about it.

429
00:44:16,954 --> 00:44:19,718
- Well...
- It's just filthy. People are filthy.

430
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:22,588
I think that's the biggest thing
that's wrong with people.

431
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,321
They'd be less violent
if they were clean...

432
00:44:24,395 --> 00:44:26,829
because then they wouldn't have
anybody to pick on.

433
00:44:27,965 --> 00:44:29,398
Dirt.

434
00:44:29,466 --> 00:44:34,199
Not dirt. See, dirt isn't bad.
It's filth. Filth is bad.

435
00:44:34,271 --> 00:44:36,831
That's what starts maggots
and riots.

436
00:44:37,908 --> 00:44:40,877
Follow that truck.
They know the best places to stop.

437
00:44:40,944 --> 00:44:44,311
- That's an old maid's tale.
- Bullshit.

438
00:44:45,249 --> 00:44:47,717
0nly truck drivers know
the best places to stop.

439
00:44:47,785 --> 00:44:49,810
Salesman and cops are.

440
00:44:49,887 --> 00:44:51,821
If you'd ever waitressed, honey,
you'd know.

441
00:44:51,889 --> 00:44:56,849
- Don't call me honey, mack.
- Don't call me mack, honey.

442
00:44:58,295 --> 00:45:01,389
I wouldn't be a waitress.
They're nasty and full of crap.

443
00:45:01,465 --> 00:45:04,161
You just hold on to your tongue.

444
00:45:04,234 --> 00:45:05,895
Hold on to this.

445
00:45:06,937 --> 00:45:08,871
If you think you can talk to me
like that...

446
00:45:08,939 --> 00:45:11,339
Shut up, all of ya!

447
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,746
I'd like a plain omelet.

448
00:45:18,816 --> 00:45:21,216
No potatoes.
Tomatoes instead.

449
00:45:21,285 --> 00:45:23,480
A cup of coffee
and wheat toast.

450
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:25,021
No substitutions.

451
00:45:25,089 --> 00:45:28,183
What do you mean?
You don't have any tomatoes?

452
00:45:28,258 --> 00:45:31,694
Only what's on the menu. You can have
number two, a plain omelet.

453
00:45:31,762 --> 00:45:33,252
It comes with fries and rolls.

454
00:45:34,431 --> 00:45:37,525
I know, but it's not
what I want.

455
00:45:37,601 --> 00:45:39,535
- Make up your mind.
- Wait.

456
00:45:39,603 --> 00:45:42,731
I have made up my mind.
I'd like a plain omelet.

457
00:45:42,806 --> 00:45:44,774
No potatoes on the plate.

458
00:45:44,842 --> 00:45:47,606
A cup of coffee and a side order
of wheat toast.

459
00:45:47,678 --> 00:45:50,169
I'm sorry, we don't have
any side orders of toast.

460
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:52,715
I'II give you an English muffin
or a coffee roll.

461
00:45:52,783 --> 00:45:57,220
No side orders of toast?
You make sandwiches, don't you?

462
00:45:58,355 --> 00:45:59,947
Would you like to talk
to the manager?

463
00:46:00,023 --> 00:46:02,958
- Hey, mack.
- Shut up.

464
00:46:03,026 --> 00:46:06,086
You've got bread
and a toaster of some kind?

465
00:46:06,163 --> 00:46:07,721
I don't make the rules.

466
00:46:07,798 --> 00:46:10,858
I'll make it
as easy for you as I can.

467
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:15,928
I'd like a plain omelet and
a chicken salad sandwich on wheat toast.

468
00:46:16,006 --> 00:46:19,999
No mayonnaise, no butter, no lettuce,
and a cup of coffee.

469
00:46:20,077 --> 00:46:22,443
A number two.
A chicken sal san.

470
00:46:22,513 --> 00:46:25,380
Hold the butter, the lettuce
and the mayonnaise.

471
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:28,213
And a cup of coffee.
Anything else?

472
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:32,119
Yeah, now all you have to do is
hold the chicken, bring me the toast...

473
00:46:32,189 --> 00:46:34,487
<i>give me a check
for a chicken salad sandwich...</i>

474
00:46:34,558 --> 00:46:36,219
and you haven't broken
any rules.

475
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:38,557
You want me
to hold the chicken, huh?

476
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:41,257
I want you to hold it
between your knees.

477
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:44,828
See that sign?
