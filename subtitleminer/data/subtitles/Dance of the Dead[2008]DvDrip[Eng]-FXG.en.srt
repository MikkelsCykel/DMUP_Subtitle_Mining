1
00:01:34,794 --> 00:01:36,694
Ma'am.

2
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:52,905
Stop.

3
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:55,031
All right, that's enough.

4
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:56,735
That's enough.

5
00:02:56,809 --> 00:02:58,777
Next. Come on.

6
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,904
I said stop!

7
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,719
Yeah! Yeah!

8
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:10,949
Aloha, kids.

9
00:03:11,023 --> 00:03:12,786
Don't forget
to buy your tickets

10
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:15,885
for the Hawaiian
Hula Prom tonight.

11
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:18,487
Tickets are on sale
outside the main office

12
00:03:18,564 --> 00:03:20,964
or at the door. Aloha!

13
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:36,073
Get your prom tickets,
only 50 bucks.

14
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:38,617
- What a rip-off.
- It's gonna be a very special night...

15
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:44,948
That's okay.

16
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,685
Get your prom tickets.

17
00:03:48,494 --> 00:03:51,224
Greetings
and welcome

18
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:53,697
to the 59th official
Sci-Fi Club meeting.

19
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:56,997
Hold on, isn't this supposed to be
the Amnesty International meeting?

20
00:03:57,069 --> 00:03:58,331
They're here at 3:00.

21
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,167
Guys, guys, stay.

22
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,605
- We got food coming.
- Dork.

23
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:07,104
Scalpel cam.

24
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,772
Mm, oh, yeah.

25
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:10,372
Nasty.

26
00:04:12,885 --> 00:04:14,819
Looks great
on the macro lens.

27
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:16,582
I'm just gonna have to
take your word for it.

28
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:19,216
I cannot wait to take you
to the prom tonight.

29
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:21,453
Okay, Jimmy, we gotta get to work.
Come on.

30
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:23,222
Don't tell me.
Tell the frog.

31
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:25,355
You can have all of me,
Lindsey, my love,

32
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:28,161
cut me open, take my heart.
It is yours.

33
00:04:28,234 --> 00:04:30,168
I feel the same way, froggy.

34
00:04:30,236 --> 00:04:32,397
And so do I, froggy.

35
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,134
Jimmy, quit acting like an idiot
and dissect your frog.

36
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:40,304
And you... how many times have I told you
shut that camera off before I break it.

37
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:44,110
You, cheerleader, take your scalpel
and cut open your frog.

38
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:46,879
I can't. I like frogs.

39
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,148
There's the stomach.

40
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:52,487
There's the liver.
There's the pancreas.

41
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:55,550
There's the brain.
Look at it.

42
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:57,255
What a dick.

43
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,355
What was that?

44
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:02,697
I was just saying what an inspiration
you are to all of us, sir.

45
00:05:02,768 --> 00:05:05,168
I mean, it's teachers like you
that really make a difference.

46
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:06,466
Stand up.

47
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:14,645
Seeing as we're dissecting
animals today, class,

48
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:16,477
I'd like everyone
to take a look at this one...

49
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:18,710
James Dunn,

50
00:05:18,784 --> 00:05:23,687
Jimmy Dunn Dunn
Dumb Dumb Dumb Dumb Dumb.

51
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:25,690
Notice the brain

52
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:28,249
devoid of all
intelligent thought;

53
00:05:28,327 --> 00:05:31,387
capable of only C-minus average,
barely passing high school;

54
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:34,695
the mouth, big and loud,

55
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:37,964
always running
with nothing to say.

56
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:39,402
Note the hands,

57
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:42,202
only worthy of working
at a drive-though;

58
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:45,836
a loser, a nothing,

59
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:48,107
a nobody.

60
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,307
You may be seated.

61
00:05:52,451 --> 00:05:54,646
Um, Mr. Hammond,

62
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,654
you forgot one organ.

63
00:05:56,722 --> 00:05:58,383
And I think you know
what you can do with that.

64
00:06:00,726 --> 00:06:04,059
See you in detention.

65
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,826
Man, why did I get in trouble?

66
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:08,833
Guilty by association.

67
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:10,630
Sorry.

68
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:13,228
Man, fuck this school.

69
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:16,605
Kyle. Kyle.

70
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:19,736
Do not make me
call the police again.

71
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:21,074
Sit down.

72
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:23,081
Relax.

73
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:25,777
Shh.
Please.

74
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:32,950
Are you recording?

75
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:34,253
Hey, this is Kyle Grubbin.

76
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:35,851
This is a screen test.

77
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:41,825
Yeah!

78
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:44,802
- You faggots looking at something?
- No.

79
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,303
I wonder which one of his sisters
he's taking to the prom.

80
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:53,175
Dude, shut up.
I heard he carries a gun in his truck.

81
00:06:53,245 --> 00:06:56,578
Dunn, you're up.

82
00:06:56,649 --> 00:06:59,982
Just relax.
He can't even hear me.

83
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:03,447
Yo.

84
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,586
That was amazing.

85
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:38,490
Okay.

86
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:42,725
It looks really good
on camera.

87
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:46,561
So I heard your date
to the prom got sick.

88
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:48,600
Yeah.

89
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:49,862
Still going?

90
00:07:49,935 --> 00:07:51,926
I wanted to talk to you about that.

91
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:54,199
Really? Wow.

92
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:57,436
You can do it, Steven!

93
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:58,909
Are those the...?

94
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,503
Yeah, the sci-fi guys.

95
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,673
Total geeks.

96
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:06,240
Do you know them?

97
00:08:06,318 --> 00:08:07,910
No.

98
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,716
Come on, Steven,
ask her!

99
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:12,883
- Use the force, Steven the force!
- Come on!

100
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:15,552
Will you guys shut up?
I'm trying to talk to Gwen.

101
00:08:16,595 --> 00:08:19,359
So should I ask him?

102
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:21,024
Him?

103
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,068
Him...

104
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:28,540
Nash Rambler.

105
00:08:28,607 --> 00:08:31,474
Nash, the band guy?
He's, like, 30.

106
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:33,569
I mean, you're a guy, Steve.
What would you say?

107
00:08:35,981 --> 00:08:38,279
Yeah, I'd say yes.

108
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:39,442
Really?

109
00:08:39,518 --> 00:08:41,042
Okay.

110
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,281
I'm gonna go ask him.

111
00:08:43,355 --> 00:08:45,380
- Oh, right now?
- Wish me luck, okay?

112
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,392
Yeah.

113
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,428
Good luck.

114
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,559
Hey, listen, listen.
Forget her.

115
00:08:52,631 --> 00:08:54,428
We have got a serious
Sci-Fi Club meeting tonight.

116
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,694
Yes, we do, baby.

117
00:08:55,768 --> 00:08:57,702
Bring your camera.
Bring your camera, all right?

118
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:00,261
Jules, I'm not going to another
robotics convention.

119
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:02,830
Ha ha, funny.
Child's play, my friend.

120
00:09:02,908 --> 00:09:04,842
Listen, I want you to focus.

121
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:07,401
Great secrets will be revealed tonight,
my young Gandalf.

122
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,414
You got that?

123
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:12,645
Steven, I know it hurts, okay?

124
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:16,085
Let it out.

125
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:19,181
Steven, Steven,
your destiny awaits.

126
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:21,192
- Your destiny.
- Destiny, Steven, destiny.

127
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,194
Destiny.

128
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:25,196
My destiny was back there.

129
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:27,926
Come on, dude.

130
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:32,938
There are three As in "Hawaiian. "

131
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:36,702
And we have 10 hours
until this dance starts.

132
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:38,937
Okay, so either you
work with me, people,

133
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:40,945
or you get the eff out of here.

134
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:43,538
Sorry. Sorry.

135
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:46,016
I'm just super stressed.

136
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:48,019
Hey hey hey,
don't worry about it.

137
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,520
I'll take care of it.

138
00:09:49,588 --> 00:09:51,522
Hey, can we get someone

139
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:54,650
to take that down, please?

140
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:56,490
Thanks.

141
00:09:56,562 --> 00:09:58,120
So I heard

142
00:09:58,197 --> 00:10:00,131
Jimmy got kicked out
of Hammond's class again.

143
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:02,258
Yeah.

144
00:10:02,334 --> 00:10:04,564
Are you seriously
going to prom with him?

145
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:06,468
Mitch, we've talked
about this.

146
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:09,269
I am going to prom
with Jimmy.

147
00:10:09,341 --> 00:10:12,037
In the pizza wagon?
Please.

148
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:19,851
You want to smell like pepperoni

149
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:22,183
or vanilla bean air freshener?

150
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:29,026
Do you smell that?

151
00:10:29,094 --> 00:10:31,654
Something's in the air.

152
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:34,460
This town always
smells like ass, man.

153
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:38,060
No no, this is... this is bad.

154
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,162
Between global warming
and smog

155
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:42,503
and that freakin'
power plant down the block,

156
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:45,806
we're killing
ourselves, bro.

157
00:10:45,878 --> 00:10:47,004
Am I interrupting?

158
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:48,171
No.

159
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:51,011
I'm Gwen from third hour.

160
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,812
You do good flips.

161
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:54,819
Thanks.

162
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:57,117
Um, I was wondering,

163
00:10:57,189 --> 00:10:59,123
are you taking anyone
to the prom tonight?

164
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:00,954
I mean, I was gonna go,

165
00:11:01,026 --> 00:11:02,857
but then my date
ate bad spinach.

166
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:05,192
So now I'm going solo.

167
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:07,732
Yep, solo.

168
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,734
Are you taking anyone?

169
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:12,396
I'd rather chew my tongue off
with a mouthful of gasoline

170
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:13,904
than go to that fucking dance.

171
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:16,168
May I ask why?

172
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:17,709
Because we refuse to listen

173
00:11:17,776 --> 00:11:19,573
to the Pinata Heads play.
That's why.

174
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:23,604
If Quarter Punks don't play,
Quarter Punks don't go.

175
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:26,276
Tell you what... go ahead
and skip that prom,

176
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,684
come over
and watch us play,

177
00:11:28,754 --> 00:11:31,018
and afterwards
you can give me head.

178
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:36,859
Shut up and stare, goofball.

179
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:39,295
- This is detention, not dreamland.
- Yes, sir.

180
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:43,568
I thought I told you
to say nothing.

181
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:46,799
So what do you say
when I say to say nothing?

182
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,806
Nothing.

183
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:51,104
You must think I'm a real idiot,
don't you?

184
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,536
Oh, so you do think
I'm an idiot then?

185
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:57,548
Answer me, boy!

186
00:11:57,616 --> 00:11:59,914
Sir, you told me not to talk.

187
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:02,749
What the hell are you talking to me
right now then for, sissy boy?

188
00:12:02,821 --> 00:12:05,312
It's 30 more minutes of watching
the Brick Channel for you...

189
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:08,121
all brick all the time.

190
00:12:08,193 --> 00:12:11,162
You may not believe this, Dunn,
but I'm trying to help you.

191
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:14,097
You do want to do something
with your life, don't you?

192
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,100
Yes, you do.

193
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:18,295
You don't want
to wind up alone, Dunn,

194
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:20,304
credit card debt
up the wazoo,

195
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:22,306
nobody to talk to
but your dog,

196
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:24,842
ex-wife won't return
your phone calls

197
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:28,107
'cause she's a bitter, fat,
stinking piece of hog meat.

198
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,808
What are you looking at?
Drop and give me 50

199
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:33,010
and count them off!

200
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,849
Everyone thinks
prom is this big event

201
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:38,219
that they're gonna remember
for the rest of their life,

202
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,985
but really it's just
an excuse for kids

203
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:41,924
to get together and get freaky
on the dance floor.

204
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:43,928
You'll forget it in 10 years.

205
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:45,861
No, I won't.

206
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,523
Yeah, you will.

207
00:12:47,599 --> 00:12:49,191
Will you forget us in 10 years?

208
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,862
Maybe, if I have Alzheimer's.

209
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:54,132
Oh, gee, how sweet.

210
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:58,006
Jimmy, did you even
get me a corsage?

211
00:12:58,077 --> 00:12:59,669
No.

212
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:01,736
I got us a motel room, though.

213
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:04,544
You know, Jimmy,
it would be really nice

214
00:13:04,616 --> 00:13:07,414
if you were romantic
for once, you know?

215
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:10,080
I'm romantic.
That thing this morning

216
00:13:10,155 --> 00:13:12,123
with the frog...
that got a huge laugh.

217
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:13,818
Is everything a joke to you?

218
00:13:13,892 --> 00:13:16,019
Yes, it is.

219
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:19,587
Well, I'm not a joke.
I'm a woman.

220
00:13:19,665 --> 00:13:22,600
And I'd like a corsage
instead of a dead frog.

221
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:24,192
Wow, I'm sorry.

222
00:13:24,269 --> 00:13:27,261
You called yourself a woman.

223
00:13:29,174 --> 00:13:32,041
That's it.

224
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:35,478
That's it. I am not going
to prom with you.

225
00:13:35,547 --> 00:13:38,141
What? Are you serious?

226
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:41,846
Yes, unlike you, I am serious.

227
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,979
I'm not going to prom with you.

228
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:45,455
You can't do that.

229
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:47,549
Yeah, I can. I just did.

230
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:49,321
Why?

231
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:53,297
Jimmy,

232
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:55,663
you spend more time
in detention

233
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:57,668
than you do in class.

234
00:13:57,736 --> 00:13:59,397
And everything
is a joke to you.

235
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:02,065
It's just not funny anymore.

236
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,554
Prom.

237
00:14:39,978 --> 00:14:42,173
I'll never ask for anything else again.
That's all I want.

238
00:14:42,247 --> 00:14:45,011
I just want to be prom queen, please.
I'm gonna be prom queen.

239
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,390
This is gonna be awesome.

240
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:04,402
I'm so glad we're not
going to the prom.

241
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:05,835
Hey guys, you ready?

242
00:15:05,904 --> 00:15:07,394
- Yeah.
- Let's lock and load.

243
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:10,033
Prom, baby, yeah!

244
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:13,812
Stupid spinach.

245
00:15:22,921 --> 00:15:25,890
Smell that?
Vanilla bean, baby.

246
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,426
Have fun.

247
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:32,691
Don't hit your crust.

248
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,971
Dunn, I got a delivery for you.

249
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:44,975
No can do, boss.
I'm going to the prom.

250
00:15:45,043 --> 00:15:46,806
It's my car you're
driving, shitball.

251
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:49,074
You do what I tell you.

252
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:51,548
Aye aye, Captain.

253
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,088
Freakin' boss.

254
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:07,364
I know it's kind of strange,

255
00:16:07,432 --> 00:16:09,423
but it's the best view in town.

256
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:17,139
Mitch, I thought we were
going to the dance.

257
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:19,143
We are. I just thought,

258
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:21,145
since you've been
working so hard,

259
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:23,147
we just take a breather,

260
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:26,673
you know, loosen up a bit.

261
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:28,720
Oh.

262
00:16:37,095 --> 00:16:38,858
Yeah, so I was thinking

263
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:40,990
about running for student council
again next year,

264
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:43,159
but I think I might
just take a year off...

265
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:45,669
you know, give other people
a chance to win.

266
00:16:45,737 --> 00:16:48,331
But then I remembered
what my dad always said...

267
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:51,808
"Never never never

268
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:54,277
let other people win. "

269
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,246
We went to the cemetery
last month, Jules.

270
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:57,942
Yes, well, we did,
but not with this.

271
00:16:58,016 --> 00:17:01,110
I got it from my brother
who works at MIT.

272
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:02,551
As an accountant.

273
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:04,953
Whatever.
He snuck it out of R&D.

274
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:07,685
He said it was developed
as some sort of prototype

275
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:09,750
to handle
ultra-high-frequency levels

276
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:12,695
of extrasensory activity
within a 10' radius.

277
00:17:12,764 --> 00:17:14,197
- Nice.
- Stop.

278
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:15,699
- What does it say?
- I don't know.

279
00:17:15,767 --> 00:17:17,792
It didn't come with
an instruction manual.

280
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:20,030
Whoa!

281
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:21,732
Y'all boys
shouldn't be here.

282
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:24,640
Oh, we're doing
research

283
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,109
of a family tree.

284
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:28,738
My uncle's buried...
in the Civil War

285
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:30,975
he was shot.
And we're looking

286
00:17:31,049 --> 00:17:33,381
for the, uh, grave.

287
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:36,580
- Right, guys? Yeah.
- Yeah.

288
00:17:38,123 --> 00:17:39,988
Stick to the path right here.

289
00:17:40,058 --> 00:17:43,619
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

290
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:45,219
What was that?

291
00:17:45,297 --> 00:17:47,663
I don't know, man,
but I got the willies bad right now.

292
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,759
Yeah, in your pants.
Come on, let's go.

293
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:53,964
You're the vice president.
I'm the president.

294
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:58,032
He's... he's a joke.

295
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:01,375
I just mean
you deserve to be

296
00:18:01,446 --> 00:18:04,938
with somebody
who respects you.

297
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:08,316
I really like you, Lindsey.

298
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:14,654
I just want you
to be happy, that's all.

299
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:30,434
Don't mess up my hair.

300
00:18:39,217 --> 00:18:40,650
Hey, shut up.

301
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:42,653
There's people
making out in there.

302
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:44,689
Come on.

303
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:47,958
- George.
- Get off me.

304
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:49,891
- George, come on.
- Just leave me.

305
00:18:49,961 --> 00:18:52,293
This is it.

306
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:54,298
- Are you getting it?
- Yeah.

307
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:56,357
This is definitely it.

308
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:58,699
Oh, this thing is going crazy.

309
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:01,671
- Come on.
- Jules, what are you doing?

310
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,935
Okay, we saw it, Jules.
It's very pretty. Let's go back.

311
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:05,874
Dude, it's open.
Come on.

312
00:19:05,944 --> 00:19:07,673
Dude, we're not
going in there.

313
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:09,737
You came all this way
to turn around and go home?

314
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,749
Fine, go home, little girl,
go home.

315
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,079
I'm going in.

316
00:19:13,151 --> 00:19:14,880
Come on.

317
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:21,253
Oh, guys,
you gotta see this.

318
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:27,327
- Steven.
- Shut up.

319
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:30,197
Holy crap.

320
00:19:30,268 --> 00:19:31,860
Why is it on the floor?

321
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:33,268
Is that even sanitary?

322
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:36,466
Rod, open it.

323
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:38,771
I'm not even coming in there, man.
You open it.

324
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:41,210
- George.
- I'm not gonna touch that thing.

325
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:43,076
Damn it, guys,
somebody's gotta open it.

326
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:45,241
Since, Jules, you're the president
of the Sci-Fi Club

327
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:47,251
maybe you want
to be our leader

328
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:49,685
and jump in there
and try to...

329
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:51,017
All right, fine.

330
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:53,785
I'll do it.

331
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,884
Pussies.

332
00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:00,489
Still rolling, Jules.

333
00:20:00,565 --> 00:20:02,533
All right.

334
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:18,216
It's empty.

335
00:20:23,321 --> 00:20:25,289
Christ.

336
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:34,832
You all right, Rod?

337
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:50,281
Come on.

338
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:54,385
There it is again.

339
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:56,387
It's just the seats.

340
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:58,389
No, it's moaning.

341
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:01,017
Sorry, my fault.

342
00:21:01,092 --> 00:21:03,890
I can't move my legs that way.

343
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:05,930
Got it.

344
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:13,329
Mitch, I don't think you should...

345
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:15,032
It's okay.

346
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:18,008
No, Mitch, really.

347
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:19,703
It's okay.

348
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:21,211
No, Mitch, stop.

349
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:22,871
- Shut up.
- Stop it.

350
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:26,844
Mitch?

351
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:31,284
Mitch?

352
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:52,543
Aw, hell.

353
00:21:59,117 --> 00:22:02,052
Come on, come on!

354
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:06,250
I said...

355
00:22:06,324 --> 00:22:08,189
Stay on the path.

356
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,023
What, you knew about this?

357
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:11,562
Why didn't you tell us?

358
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,723
Hey, man, I'm just
trying to keep my job.

359
00:22:13,798 --> 00:22:16,426
Hit 'em in the brain.
It's the only way to kill 'em.

360
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:36,753
Come on.

361
00:22:36,821 --> 00:22:39,016
Come on, come on,
come on.

362
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:18,721
- Oh, God.
- Open the door! Open the door!

363
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:20,731
I just killed those people.

364
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,495
No, you didn't.
Open the door.

365
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,970
Get in.

366
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:48,457
Hey, no eating in store.

367
00:25:28,259 --> 00:25:30,193
Pizza Wagon.

368
00:25:30,261 --> 00:25:32,593
Yum-yum, come get some.

369
00:25:34,165 --> 00:25:36,827
Come on, people.
I got a prom to go to

370
00:25:36,901 --> 00:25:39,392
without my girlfriend.

371
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:46,441
Ma'am, I see you.

372
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:54,042
Whoa.

373
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:55,916
Are you okay?

374
00:25:55,987 --> 00:25:58,319
Okay, all right.

375
00:25:58,389 --> 00:26:00,186
I'm gonna call 911,

376
00:26:00,258 --> 00:26:01,623
or not.

377
00:26:01,693 --> 00:26:05,129
Uh, someone help, anyone.

378
00:26:05,196 --> 00:26:07,096
Ma'am, ma'am, I'm not gonna
be able to help you

379
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:09,133
if you don't stop
biting at me like that.

380
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,168
Okay?

381
00:26:13,505 --> 00:26:15,973
Uh, sorry to interrupt.

382
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,445
Here comes
the neighborhood.

383
00:26:36,194 --> 00:26:38,128
Smoking out of
the devil bong, man.

384
00:26:38,196 --> 00:26:40,130
Devil bong!

385
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:44,925
Close the door,
Jensen.

386
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,772
All right, that's what
I'm talking about!

387
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:01,080
Hey, you kids.

388
00:27:01,152 --> 00:27:04,383
Principal Castlemoody.

389
00:27:04,455 --> 00:27:06,286
- Is that beer?
- No.

390
00:27:06,357 --> 00:27:09,349
Give me that.

391
00:27:09,427 --> 00:27:13,022
Yeah, you too, smart guy.

392
00:27:13,097 --> 00:27:15,031
You're lucky I don't
call your mamas.

393
00:27:15,099 --> 00:27:17,033
Get back in there.

394
00:27:17,101 --> 00:27:19,069
Get!

395
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,531
Punk-ass kids.

396
00:27:39,891 --> 00:27:41,825
Oh, God.

397
00:27:41,893 --> 00:27:44,555
Mr. Hammond, you scared
the crap out of me.

398
00:27:48,766 --> 00:27:50,700
What happened
to your face, Frank?

399
00:28:33,344 --> 00:28:35,642
Don't move
or I'll scorch you.

400
00:28:41,486 --> 00:28:45,047
Kyle?

401
00:28:45,123 --> 00:28:47,091
Yeah.

402
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,294
They gone?

403
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:54,798
I don't know,
but are you okay?

404
00:28:54,866 --> 00:28:56,299
Get your hands off me.

405
00:28:56,367 --> 00:28:59,495
You're lucky I'm not kicking
your ass right now.

406
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:02,232
Drop it, Kyle.
It's tired.

407
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:04,434
What?

408
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:07,137
Your friends are dead and those things
are coming back this way

409
00:29:07,211 --> 00:29:09,145
and I'd rather not be
here when they do.

410
00:29:09,213 --> 00:29:11,147
Man, piss off!

411
00:29:11,215 --> 00:29:15,174
I ain't scared
of nothing... nothing.

412
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:17,380
Are you serious?
I just heard you crying over there

413
00:29:17,455 --> 00:29:19,355
like a bitch
a second ago.

414
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,790
How do I know you are not
one of them, huh?

415
00:29:23,861 --> 00:29:26,694
Give me one good reason why I shouldn't
pop your head off right now.

416
00:29:30,034 --> 00:29:32,594
Yo, man, they're jacking your car.

417
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:35,400
You assholes!
Wait up!

418
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:38,670
Damn it. My boss
is gonna kill me.

419
00:29:45,216 --> 00:29:46,808
Whoa.

420
00:29:46,884 --> 00:29:49,011
Do you have
a license for that?

421
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:51,885
No carnivorous cocksucker
is gonna mess with me.

422
00:29:53,891 --> 00:29:55,518
Who are you calling?

423
00:29:55,593 --> 00:29:56,821
Who do you think?
The cops.

424
00:29:56,894 --> 00:29:59,158
No, no cops.
My daddy's a cop.

425
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:00,697
Great.

426
00:30:00,765 --> 00:30:02,824
No, I hate my daddy.
No cops.

427
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,629
Don't be ridiculous.
We need them.

428
00:30:04,702 --> 00:30:07,170
Who is the man
with the gun?

429
00:30:09,807 --> 00:30:12,742
Kyle, I'm on your side.

430
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:17,679
Those are the guys
you want to shoot.

431
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:20,013
Waste 'em.

432
00:30:20,084 --> 00:30:21,574
What is taking you
so long?

433
00:30:21,652 --> 00:30:24,177
I have got to load it.

434
00:30:24,255 --> 00:30:26,849
All right?

435
00:30:26,924 --> 00:30:28,016
Come on, come on.

436
00:30:36,701 --> 00:30:38,430
Wow.

437
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:39,936
That was disturbing.

438
00:30:41,272 --> 00:30:43,934
- Hey, watch this.
- No!

439
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:45,771
Sorry, Gwen,
it was a mistake.

440
00:30:45,843 --> 00:30:48,437
Jimmy, are you crazy?

441
00:31:53,911 --> 00:31:55,378
Jimmy!

442
00:32:01,486 --> 00:32:03,477
I gotta
get out of here.

443
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:08,325
Come on, man, wait up.

444
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:19,536
- Just go, just drive!
- I'm driving.

445
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:21,629
- Stop arguing, just drive.
- I'm not arguing.

446
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:23,469
We're all gonna die
because of you.

447
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:25,532
- Jules, shut up.
- Listen, don't tell me to shut up.

448
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:28,170
I brought the shotgun.
I got the second-most power in this car.

449
00:32:28,246 --> 00:32:30,009
I keep dialing 911,
but the number's busy.

450
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:31,514
- How can it be busy?
- I don't know.

451
00:32:31,582 --> 00:32:33,447
- Just keep dialing then.
- I have been.

452
00:32:33,518 --> 00:32:37,318
Just dial the number.
Now, it's 911. 411's information.

453
00:32:37,388 --> 00:32:38,821
Thanks, Jules, thanks,

454
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:40,824
Aren't you Jimmy Dunn's
girlfriend?

455
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:42,154
Uh-huh.

456
00:32:42,226 --> 00:32:44,717
Then whose car is this?

457
00:32:46,797 --> 00:32:48,731
Go go go go.
What are you...?

458
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,994
- Don't stop the car.
- Why are you stopping?

459
00:32:51,068 --> 00:32:54,435
I didn't do anything.
It just stopped.

460
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:58,241
- They ripped through the engine?
- Apparently so.

461
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:00,243
What are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do, guys?

462
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:02,609
Does anyone have
a plan or something?

463
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,080
Why don't you shut up and try thinking
of one yourself, princess, okay?

464
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:06,878
Hey, easy.

465
00:33:06,951 --> 00:33:08,885
Let's not bite
each other's heads off.

466
00:33:08,953 --> 00:33:11,217
That's kind of funny.

467
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:14,281
It is kind of funny.
I didn't think of it like that.

468
00:33:14,358 --> 00:33:16,690
It works kind of both ways.
It's funny but it's not.

469
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:19,195
Guys, if you don't
straighten up

470
00:33:19,263 --> 00:33:21,925
you're gonna end up
like Rod.

471
00:33:21,999 --> 00:33:23,967
That's not cool, man.

472
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:25,559
What is she doing?

473
00:33:25,636 --> 00:33:27,297
Lindsey, let's go.
Come on.

474
00:33:27,371 --> 00:33:29,839
It's chicks like that

475
00:33:29,907 --> 00:33:31,841
that make me glad
I don't have a girlfriend.

476
00:33:31,909 --> 00:33:34,207
- Right.
- What's that supposed to mean?

477
00:33:34,278 --> 00:33:37,111
Pick up, Jimmy.
Please pick up.

478
00:33:39,984 --> 00:33:42,782
Jimmy?

479
00:33:42,853 --> 00:33:45,151
It's Jimmy.
Hey, guys, it's Jimmy.

480
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:48,215
Jimmy! Jimmy!

481
00:33:48,292 --> 00:33:49,657
Thank God he's alive.

482
00:33:57,034 --> 00:33:58,001
Jimmy?

483
00:34:00,037 --> 00:34:02,335
It's not Jimmy.
Run!

484
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,507
My dress.

485
00:34:11,515 --> 00:34:14,780
You made me
rip my dress.

486
00:34:20,324 --> 00:34:22,724
- Guys, it's locked.
- Open it.

487
00:34:25,029 --> 00:34:26,621
Shut the door.
Shut the door.

488
00:34:26,697 --> 00:34:28,562
Don't. Shut up, Jules.
She's coming.

489
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:30,362
She's not gonna make it.
Shut the door.

490
00:34:30,434 --> 00:34:32,766
- Lindsey, come on.
- Let's go, hurry up.

491
00:34:32,837 --> 00:34:34,134
He's right
behind you.

492
00:34:37,975 --> 00:34:40,273
- There's more coming.
- Guys, we need to board up this door.

493
00:34:40,344 --> 00:34:42,403
Find whatever you can
and use it.

494
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,244
We need to board up these windows
and that door too. Let's go.

495
00:34:45,316 --> 00:34:47,216
Whoa whoa whoa,
who put you in charge?

496
00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:50,118
I am vice president
of the student council.

497
00:34:50,187 --> 00:34:52,417
Oh, yeah? Well, I'm the president
of the Sci-Fi Club.

498
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:55,015
And you're the genius who brought us
here tonight. I'm with her.

499
00:34:55,092 --> 00:34:57,185
Okay, come on. Let's get this couch,
move it in front of the door.

500
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:59,320
Here, George over here.
Steven, right there.

501
00:34:59,397 --> 00:35:01,831
Go, come on, faster.
You hold this.

502
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:05,335
Wait a second.
No no no, we're not staying.

503
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:08,702
Jules, either help out or get
the eff out of the way, okay?

504
00:35:18,683 --> 00:35:20,446
Why is this happening?

505
00:35:20,518 --> 00:35:23,783
End of the world.

506
00:35:23,854 --> 00:35:27,415
God's flushing the toilet.

507
00:35:27,491 --> 00:35:29,686
It's his way of saying,
"Y'all couldn't work it out,

508
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,421
so adios. "

509
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:36,088
I didn't take you
for a religious man, Kyle.

510
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:40,729
I just tell it
like the Bible does.

511
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:43,137
I'm gonna need
years of therapy after this.

512
00:35:43,207 --> 00:35:46,472
Gwen, it's gonna be okay.

513
00:35:46,544 --> 00:35:48,478
Liar.

514
00:35:48,546 --> 00:35:51,674
Shut up, Kyle.

515
00:35:51,749 --> 00:35:53,683
Dude, watch the window.

516
00:35:53,751 --> 00:35:55,048
Oh, thank God it's Jimmy.

517
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:57,314
Hey, Lindsey,
are you all right?

518
00:35:57,388 --> 00:35:58,946
Tell her I say hi.

519
00:35:59,023 --> 00:36:00,285
Where are you?

520
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:02,292
Where are we?
Guys, where are we?

521
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,521
- I don't know.
- I think we're at a corner of Oak,

522
00:36:04,595 --> 00:36:06,153
in the house
near Millpond.

523
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:08,164
Oak and Millpond?

524
00:36:08,232 --> 00:36:10,700
Yeah, Oak and Millpond.
We can get there from here.

525
00:36:10,768 --> 00:36:12,963
Just stay right where you are.
I'll come and get you.

526
00:36:13,037 --> 00:36:14,061
Really?

527
00:36:14,138 --> 00:36:16,402
Of course.

528
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:18,101
I'll be there.

529
00:36:18,175 --> 00:36:20,268
Okay.

530
00:36:21,312 --> 00:36:23,780
Whoa whoa whoa, hey,

531
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:26,214
who said you get to go
get your girl?

532
00:36:26,283 --> 00:36:29,013
She's with other people, Kyle.
It's better protection.

533
00:36:31,021 --> 00:36:33,888
She'd better be worth it.

534
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:35,949
She is.

535
00:36:45,636 --> 00:36:47,399
We can crawl
across town down here

536
00:36:47,471 --> 00:36:48,938
without them
ever seeing us.

537
00:36:49,006 --> 00:36:50,940
I used to play down here
when I was a little kid.

538
00:36:51,008 --> 00:36:53,169
You was one messed up
little kid, huh?

539
00:36:53,244 --> 00:36:54,973
- Yeah.
- Me too.

540
00:36:55,045 --> 00:36:56,979
Hurry.

541
00:36:57,047 --> 00:36:59,345
Go on.
Go on, girl.

542
00:37:08,759 --> 00:37:10,750
Come on, this way.

543
00:37:12,129 --> 00:37:15,496
Oh my God.
It stinks.

544
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:18,000
Whoa.

545
00:37:18,068 --> 00:37:19,626
What is that?

546
00:37:19,703 --> 00:37:21,637
Is that poop?

547
00:37:21,705 --> 00:37:25,038
That shit ain't shit.

548
00:37:25,109 --> 00:37:28,272
Something's wrong
with that shit.

549
00:37:28,345 --> 00:37:30,677
Must you curse so much?

550
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:32,841
Looks like the power plant's
been dumping

551
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:34,748
something fierce
down here.

552
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:36,878
This town's, like,
marinating in it.

553
00:37:36,954 --> 00:37:39,479
It must have finally reached
its boiling point.

554
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:42,025
Ugh, I shouldn't
be here right now.

555
00:37:42,092 --> 00:37:43,923
I should be at prom
in a beautiful dress,

556
00:37:43,994 --> 00:37:47,088
slow-dancing
with Nash or somebody.

557
00:37:47,164 --> 00:37:50,964
Hey, I'm somebody.

558
00:37:53,003 --> 00:37:54,834
So what we got is,

559
00:37:54,905 --> 00:37:57,499
"I slept with my
third-grade teacher. "

560
00:37:57,575 --> 00:37:59,509
Teacher... what rhymes
with "teacher"?

561
00:37:59,577 --> 00:38:01,943
- She was a sexual creature.
- Preacher. Preacher.

562
00:38:02,012 --> 00:38:04,173
- Sexual creature.
- "Creature" is the way to go.

563
00:38:04,248 --> 00:38:06,182
"She was
a sexual creature.

564
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:08,548
She always made me
feel all right. "

565
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:10,883
- She kept me up at night.
- She flew my kite.

566
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:13,185
Dude, chill out, man.
Seriously, stay in the circle.

567
00:38:13,257 --> 00:38:15,316
Okay, like it.
I like it.

568
00:38:15,392 --> 00:38:17,485
"She made me feel all right.

569
00:38:17,561 --> 00:38:19,461
- She kept me up all night. "
- Kept me up all night.

570
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:22,658
"She taught me the ways
of multiplication. "

571
00:38:22,733 --> 00:38:24,826
Multiplication...
that's what she taught.

572
00:38:24,902 --> 00:38:27,063
And led to my first
masturbation.

573
00:38:27,137 --> 00:38:29,867
God damn, no,
Jensen, man.

574
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,532
You've hotboxed
the entire garage.

575
00:38:31,609 --> 00:38:33,873
I swear, you've smoked
us all stupid.

576
00:38:33,944 --> 00:38:36,538
- Go open the door.
- Open the door, go.

577
00:38:36,614 --> 00:38:38,741
- "Masturbation. "
- I can't even hear myself think.

578
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:41,944
How do you expect me to get
to the next level with this song?

579
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:50,517
One of you jokers laced my joint
with formaldehyde again?

580
00:38:50,594 --> 00:38:51,925
Whoa.

581
00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:34,203
Want to touch
my Mohawk?

582
00:39:34,271 --> 00:39:36,671
- Kyle, would you stop?
- You smell good.

583
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:38,731
I think this is it.

584
00:39:40,377 --> 00:39:42,072
I am not going in there.

585
00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:45,877
Okay, go go go.

586
00:39:52,389 --> 00:39:54,857
It's dark.
Come on.

587
00:39:54,925 --> 00:39:57,120
Come on,
let's go.

588
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:02,922
Hello?

589
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,934
Lindsey?

590
00:40:05,002 --> 00:40:09,496
- Creepy.
- There's a light.

591
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:11,541
A door.
Come on.

592
00:40:13,711 --> 00:40:15,679
Yeah yeah,
this is it.

593
00:40:17,815 --> 00:40:21,273
Jimmy!
You've found us.

594
00:40:21,352 --> 00:40:24,048
I'm so glad
you're okay.

595
00:40:24,121 --> 00:40:27,921
Steven, I'm okay.

596
00:40:27,992 --> 00:40:30,517
You've got your tux.

597
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:32,528
You look nice.

598
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:34,757
You look wonderful,
baby.

599
00:40:34,832 --> 00:40:37,665
You can let go now.

600
00:40:37,735 --> 00:40:39,999
Sorry. Yeah.

601
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:43,539
Awkward, dude.

602
00:40:44,575 --> 00:40:49,103
Oh, shit. Hey, Kyle Grubbin,
what are you doing here?

603
00:40:49,179 --> 00:40:52,580
Bashing heads, turning shit up...
you know, the usual.

604
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:54,675
Kyle couldn't get
a date to the prom.

605
00:40:54,752 --> 00:40:56,344
All the farm animals
were busy.

606
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:58,820
Man, I screw college girls.

607
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:08,792
So how did you end up
with these guys?

608
00:41:08,866 --> 00:41:11,391
We were at the cemetery
and these things... they just came out

609
00:41:11,468 --> 00:41:13,402
and they pulled Mitch
and they took...

610
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:16,200
Wait, Mitch? What were you doing
at the cemetery with Mitch?

611
00:41:16,273 --> 00:41:19,140
We were just parked,
you know, by the bluff.

612
00:41:19,209 --> 00:41:21,803
Mitch Cutter?
You were with him?

613
00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:24,905
Yeah, but nothing happened.

614
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:27,348
Mitch Cutter.

615
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:29,943
At least have the decency to dump me
for someone cool.

616
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,954
The guy's a tool,

617
00:41:32,022 --> 00:41:34,422
and you're a tool
by association.

618
00:41:34,491 --> 00:41:37,153
Why him?

619
00:41:37,227 --> 00:41:39,991
Because he took
life seriously

620
00:41:40,064 --> 00:41:44,660
and I thought he liked me.

621
00:41:44,735 --> 00:41:46,703
He liked you on the back seat
of his car.

622
00:41:50,607 --> 00:41:52,541
Wonderful.

623
00:41:52,609 --> 00:41:55,009
Move that chair.
No, give it to me.

624
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:57,013
Give it to Kyle.

625
00:41:57,081 --> 00:41:59,709
Looks good, Kyle.

626
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:03,579
That should do it, yeah.

627
00:42:03,654 --> 00:42:05,588
You chew?

628
00:42:05,656 --> 00:42:07,920
Yeah, I'm Jewish.

629
00:42:07,991 --> 00:42:10,459
Why?

630
00:42:10,527 --> 00:42:13,394
I'll try some of that.

631
00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:16,297
Mm, that's good.

632
00:42:16,366 --> 00:42:18,596
You don't know
how weird this is, man.

633
00:42:18,669 --> 00:42:20,967
Remember last year we were in gym
and you tripped over me

634
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:22,835
and started to hit me
in the face for no reason,

635
00:42:22,906 --> 00:42:24,999
I started bleeding and everybody
started laughing

636
00:42:25,075 --> 00:42:26,872
and I started to cry?

637
00:42:26,944 --> 00:42:29,538
Remember that?

638
00:42:29,613 --> 00:42:31,547
Nuh-uh.

639
00:42:31,615 --> 00:42:33,549
Hey, you remember
junior year when you...

640
00:42:33,617 --> 00:42:35,551
oh, okay.
You remember

641
00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:37,849
junior year when
you broke my arm

642
00:42:37,921 --> 00:42:39,855
'cause you said
I looked at you funny?

643
00:42:39,923 --> 00:42:41,857
Remember that?

644
00:42:41,925 --> 00:42:43,654
Man, that was you?

645
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:45,160
Yeah.

646
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:47,129
Man.

647
00:42:47,197 --> 00:42:49,961
Good times.
Yeah.

648
00:42:50,033 --> 00:42:52,365
How's your arm?

649
00:42:52,436 --> 00:42:54,370
Not good, actually.

650
00:42:54,438 --> 00:42:58,966
Um, but Kyle,
I hate to admit it,

651
00:42:59,042 --> 00:43:01,408
but I'm actually glad
you're here.

652
00:43:01,478 --> 00:43:03,776
You're the biggest
badass I know.

653
00:43:03,847 --> 00:43:05,781
Hoorah!

654
00:43:13,524 --> 00:43:15,822
Too bad we didn't
go to prom together.

655
00:43:15,893 --> 00:43:18,123
Then we wouldn't be
in this mess.

656
00:43:18,195 --> 00:43:20,254
We were supposed to go
to the prom together?

657
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:22,855
That was kind of my plan.

658
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:26,767
But you never asked me.

659
00:43:26,837 --> 00:43:29,203
Eh, you would have
said no.

660
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:31,935
Steven, if I had a choice
between this place

661
00:43:32,009 --> 00:43:33,943
and going to prom
with you,

662
00:43:34,011 --> 00:43:36,309
I would have
chosen you.

663
00:43:47,891 --> 00:43:50,155
You guys...

664
00:43:54,364 --> 00:43:56,832
we're in a funeral home.

665
00:44:05,175 --> 00:44:08,542
Yo, who farted?

666
00:44:30,267 --> 00:44:32,667
Go!

667
00:44:40,944 --> 00:44:42,878
- Is she dead?
- I don't know, George.

668
00:44:42,946 --> 00:44:45,005
- Why don't you check her pulse?
- Is everybody okay?

669
00:44:45,082 --> 00:44:46,879
There's got to be
a light somewhere.

670
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:48,645
Someone find the light switch.
Come on.

671
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:50,448
I can't see anything.

672
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:52,420
Feel along the walls.

673
00:44:52,489 --> 00:44:55,754
Jules, is that you?

674
00:44:57,594 --> 00:44:59,459
Steven, get off me.

675
00:44:59,529 --> 00:45:01,827
Sorry, Gwen.

676
00:45:01,899 --> 00:45:03,764
I think I got it.

677
00:45:05,769 --> 00:45:07,760
Ugh.

678
00:45:07,838 --> 00:45:10,466
Crazy old bitch.

679
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:20,414
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

680
00:45:25,422 --> 00:45:27,253
Where did he go?

681
00:45:29,826 --> 00:45:31,726
Make yourself useful.
Load it.

682
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:55,510
Now!

683
00:46:04,661 --> 00:46:06,526
- George, get out of the way.
- Hey!

684
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:37,184
It hurts.

685
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:44,828
Am I dying?

686
00:46:44,901 --> 00:46:48,098
No, man, you're fine.

687
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:52,870
Liar.

688
00:46:56,179 --> 00:46:59,376
Jim, I'm sorry I whacked you
at school today.

689
00:46:59,449 --> 00:47:01,576
Shh, don't talk.

690
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:06,255
I'm sorry I was a dick.

691
00:47:09,192 --> 00:47:12,161
It's okay.
I deserved it.

692
00:47:14,931 --> 00:47:19,027
Jim, do me a favor.

693
00:47:19,102 --> 00:47:21,627
Anything.

694
00:47:24,107 --> 00:47:26,439
Kill 'em all.

695
00:47:35,652 --> 00:47:37,620
Kyle.

696
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:44,286
Kyle.

697
00:47:46,296 --> 00:47:48,594
What are we gonna do?

698
00:48:01,845 --> 00:48:04,245
Um, Jimmy,

699
00:48:04,314 --> 00:48:05,906
he just got bit.

700
00:48:05,982 --> 00:48:08,610
So shouldn't we, like, leave?

701
00:48:49,226 --> 00:48:51,694
Hey.

702
00:48:51,761 --> 00:48:54,286
Are you okay?

703
00:48:57,567 --> 00:48:59,535
This is
such a tragedy.

704
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:04,063
I really really just wanted everything
to be perfect.

705
00:49:07,844 --> 00:49:09,903
Oh, gosh, the prom.

706
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:13,681
Every teenager in town
is at that prom.

707
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:15,650
Oh, man.

708
00:49:15,719 --> 00:49:18,552
Guys, all that noise,
all the fresh meat...

709
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:20,214
every zombie in town
will be there.

710
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:21,951
It will be
a feeding frenzy.

711
00:49:22,025 --> 00:49:23,959
Our entire high school
class will be gone.

712
00:49:24,027 --> 00:49:26,086
- History.
- All of 'em.

713
00:49:26,163 --> 00:49:27,721
No one's picking up.

714
00:49:28,832 --> 00:49:31,460
We have to warn
everyone.

715
00:49:31,535 --> 00:49:33,162
What, you're going
to the prom?

716
00:49:33,236 --> 00:49:36,262
Are you crazy?
It's, like, 1000 to six.

717
00:49:36,339 --> 00:49:39,137
We just got to stay here. I'm sure
the government knows about this.

718
00:49:39,209 --> 00:49:41,200
They have to. They should be
sending somebody.

719
00:49:41,278 --> 00:49:44,304
Look...

720
00:49:44,381 --> 00:49:46,315
if we die two weeks from now

721
00:49:46,383 --> 00:49:48,317
or two hours,

722
00:49:48,385 --> 00:49:51,115
I'd like to go out fighting.

723
00:49:51,188 --> 00:49:53,486
If we don't stop those things
from getting to the prom,

724
00:49:53,557 --> 00:49:55,752
then our world is over.

725
00:49:58,628 --> 00:50:00,858
I'm tired of being a lower.

726
00:50:03,033 --> 00:50:05,900
Okay.
So how do we get there?

727
00:50:05,969 --> 00:50:07,903
We fight our way.

728
00:50:07,971 --> 00:50:09,404
With what?

729
00:50:09,472 --> 00:50:11,872
- With this.
- And with this.

730
00:50:11,942 --> 00:50:14,706
- Don't be stupid. The gun's empty.
- No, it's not.

731
00:50:21,451 --> 00:50:23,248
Now it is.

732
00:50:24,287 --> 00:50:26,949
Guys, there's a hearse
out front...

733
00:50:27,023 --> 00:50:28,854
a hearse big enough for six.

734
00:50:28,925 --> 00:50:30,756
So who's the fastest runner?

735
00:50:30,827 --> 00:50:32,454
I don't have
my sneakers on today.

736
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:34,360
And I don't have any shoes.

737
00:50:34,431 --> 00:50:35,591
I have asthma.

738
00:50:35,665 --> 00:50:37,257
And I have a wooden leg.

739
00:50:37,334 --> 00:50:39,234
Come on, guys,
if you can run fast, you say so.

740
00:50:39,302 --> 00:50:41,930
Um...

741
00:50:42,005 --> 00:50:43,529
I can move pretty fast.

742
00:50:43,607 --> 00:50:45,802
Yeah, send the cheerleader.
That's a great idea.

743
00:50:45,875 --> 00:50:49,072
Guys, I can see the hearse.
It's by the curb.

744
00:50:49,145 --> 00:50:52,808
You don't have
to do this, Gwen.

745
00:50:52,882 --> 00:50:55,851
You're right.
You do it.

746
00:50:55,919 --> 00:50:59,980
Me? I'm not really athletic.

747
00:51:00,056 --> 00:51:02,354
See what I mean?

748
00:51:02,425 --> 00:51:04,450
All right,
is everybody ready?

749
00:51:08,598 --> 00:51:09,826
Jules, on three.

750
00:51:12,335 --> 00:51:14,132
One...

751
00:51:17,874 --> 00:51:19,432
- two...
- Dear God, be with Gwen.

752
00:51:19,509 --> 00:51:21,067
She runs for her life
into hell.

753
00:51:21,144 --> 00:51:23,772
I don't like it.
I don't want to go.

754
00:51:26,483 --> 00:51:28,417
Three!

755
00:51:28,485 --> 00:51:31,545
Come on.
Go!

756
00:51:34,190 --> 00:51:36,158
All clear.

757
00:51:41,898 --> 00:51:43,832
Run, Gwen.
Go go go go!

758
00:51:53,543 --> 00:51:55,511
God, I love that girl.

759
00:51:58,915 --> 00:52:01,748
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

760
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:05,911
Guys, come on,
get in the car!

761
00:52:11,227 --> 00:52:13,218
Come on,
Steven, quick!

762
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:15,264
Let's go, let's go,
let's go!

763
00:52:18,768 --> 00:52:20,861
I'm going as fast as I can!
This is a hearse!

764
00:52:20,937 --> 00:52:22,131
- Is everybody okay?
- Yes.

765
00:52:22,205 --> 00:52:23,638
I'm good.
We're good.

766
00:52:23,707 --> 00:52:26,005
- George, did you find a map?
- Yeah, I got one in my pants.

767
00:52:26,076 --> 00:52:28,738
It's a big map.
Where am I gonna get a map from?

768
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:30,803
Guys, what the hell was that?

769
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:32,507
That was a tire.
It blew out.

770
00:52:32,582 --> 00:52:34,140
Someone shot it.
I think someone shot at us.

771
00:52:34,217 --> 00:52:36,242
Who would be shooting at us?

772
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:37,752
I'll take you first, monsters!

773
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:39,015
Don't shoot, Coach!

774
00:52:39,089 --> 00:52:40,579
- Who's that?
- Coach Keel, don't shoot.

775
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:43,319
Jimmy Dunn, fourth period.
You had me in detention today.

776
00:52:43,393 --> 00:52:46,692
Dunn?

777
00:52:46,763 --> 00:52:48,526
Them sons of bitches
ate my dog.

778
00:52:48,598 --> 00:52:50,623
They ate my dog,

779
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:54,067
my German shepherd,
the best bitch I've ever had.

780
00:52:54,137 --> 00:52:56,935
I was able to keep them green boys
away from the neighbors for a bit,

781
00:52:57,006 --> 00:52:59,770
but they got to one,
then they got to another and another,

782
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:01,572
so I had to kill
the whole block.

783
00:53:01,644 --> 00:53:05,637
Yeah, it's been a rough one
for all of us.

784
00:53:08,017 --> 00:53:10,110
- Hey.
- Hey.

785
00:53:13,289 --> 00:53:14,847
Ooh, boy,

786
00:53:14,924 --> 00:53:16,949
looks like you got
yourself a platoon.

787
00:53:17,026 --> 00:53:18,550
Where are y'all going?

788
00:53:18,628 --> 00:53:20,596
To the prom,
to kick some zombie ass.

789
00:53:20,663 --> 00:53:23,496
The prom...

790
00:53:23,566 --> 00:53:26,296
it'll be a regular Thanksgiving-day
supper for them green boys.

791
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:28,599
All right, we'd better
get suited up then.

792
00:53:28,671 --> 00:53:30,036
Suited up?

793
00:53:31,741 --> 00:53:34,335
You don't win wars with toothpicks
and cheddar cheese, missy.

794
00:53:34,411 --> 00:53:37,437
You gotta be prepared.
Ain't that right, Dunn?

795
00:53:37,514 --> 00:53:39,948
Yes, sir.

796
00:53:40,016 --> 00:53:41,813
All right, let's get in gear.

797
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:43,512
We got us a war to win.

798
00:54:04,707 --> 00:54:07,039
I wish it was a corsage.

799
00:54:08,812 --> 00:54:10,643
Little lady,
you'll get the machete.

800
00:54:10,713 --> 00:54:12,305
But I don't know
how to shoot a machete.

801
00:54:22,392 --> 00:54:25,020
What the hell is wrong
with you, son?

802
00:54:25,094 --> 00:54:28,154
Whoa, is this what
I think it is, Coach?

803
00:54:28,231 --> 00:54:30,062
Don't move, kid!
Don't move!

804
00:54:30,133 --> 00:54:31,998
Don't move.
Don't you move.

805
00:54:32,068 --> 00:54:34,263
You can take out
the whole city block with this.

806
00:54:34,337 --> 00:54:36,703
Whoosh!
No eyebrows, man,

807
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:38,707
a mushroom cloud,
the whole deal.

808
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:42,267
I got this off craigslist
for emergencies only.

809
00:54:42,345 --> 00:54:45,314
Everyone gets a walkie.
Tune to channel 22.

810
00:54:45,381 --> 00:54:47,508
Let's sync
those watches, people.

811
00:54:47,584 --> 00:54:49,552
Come on,
move move move!

812
00:54:51,688 --> 00:54:55,283
Do we have any more
helmets, Jules?

813
00:54:55,358 --> 00:54:56,552
No, man.

814
00:54:56,626 --> 00:54:58,116
Well, can I have
that one, please?

815
00:54:58,194 --> 00:55:00,128
Sorry, it's the last one.
Stop.

816
00:55:00,196 --> 00:55:01,788
Dude, come on, you're taller
than me, Jules.

817
00:55:01,865 --> 00:55:02,991
- Please?
- No.

818
00:55:03,066 --> 00:55:05,227
This is so cool.

819
00:55:05,301 --> 00:55:07,235
No guns for you kids.

820
00:55:07,303 --> 00:55:09,567
Guns are mine, all mine.

821
00:55:12,575 --> 00:55:14,805
I don't want to repeat
history, man,

822
00:55:14,878 --> 00:55:17,312
like Rod did.
Please?

823
00:55:18,448 --> 00:55:19,881
Please?

824
00:55:19,949 --> 00:55:21,439
Rod?

825
00:55:21,518 --> 00:55:23,315
Jules...

826
00:55:25,855 --> 00:55:27,152
Thanks.

827
00:55:30,059 --> 00:55:32,653
Um, can we say a prayer?

828
00:55:32,729 --> 00:55:35,596
I know it sounds super dorky,
but we really need it.

829
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:37,428
Are you serious?

830
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,092
Yeah.

831
00:55:39,168 --> 00:55:41,102
Make it quick, okay?

832
00:55:41,170 --> 00:55:43,229
Okay, everyone hold hands.

833
00:55:43,306 --> 00:55:45,399
Gay.

834
00:55:45,475 --> 00:55:47,773
Shut up, Jules.

835
00:55:50,213 --> 00:55:51,646
Continue, Lindsey.

836
00:55:51,714 --> 00:55:53,944
Okay, um,
dear God,

837
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:56,485
we don't know why you've brought
the dead back to life,

838
00:55:56,553 --> 00:55:58,487
but you have.

839
00:55:58,555 --> 00:56:00,682
So we pray that you help us
through tonight...

840
00:56:00,757 --> 00:56:02,088
Mm-hmm.

841
00:56:02,158 --> 00:56:04,456
...help us to help others
through tonight.

842
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:06,995
Lord, we know this is
not a perfect world

843
00:56:07,063 --> 00:56:08,997
and we are
far from perfect,

844
00:56:09,065 --> 00:56:12,193
but could you please
lend us a hand here?

845
00:56:12,268 --> 00:56:15,135
Protect us.

846
00:56:15,204 --> 00:56:16,398
In Jesus's name...

847
00:56:16,472 --> 00:56:19,032
For the love of Buddha,
are we done?

848
00:56:19,108 --> 00:56:21,076
...amen.

849
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:26,177
Let's rock.

850
00:56:32,455 --> 00:56:34,389
Bitchin' ride, Coach.

851
00:56:34,457 --> 00:56:36,391
It took me three years
to save up for her,

852
00:56:36,459 --> 00:56:38,518
but she's worth it.

853
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:03,882
Why aren't they attacking?

854
00:57:03,953 --> 00:57:05,887
Who cares?
They're sitting ducks.

855
00:57:05,955 --> 00:57:09,391
Wait a second...

856
00:57:09,459 --> 00:57:10,756
Oh!

857
00:57:16,432 --> 00:57:18,491
Ew, is he done yet?

858
00:57:18,568 --> 00:57:21,196
Not yet.

859
00:57:21,270 --> 00:57:23,238
Okay, I think he's done.

860
00:57:24,273 --> 00:57:27,504
Oh, not yet.
Yes. No.

861
00:57:27,577 --> 00:57:28,839
Oh, that did it.

862
00:57:28,911 --> 00:57:31,277
Yeah, he's done.

863
00:57:31,347 --> 00:57:34,009
Now do you jerkoffs believe me
about the power plant?

864
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:36,711
- Nash!
- Spinach!

865
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:39,584
Oh, great, it's Nash.

866
00:57:39,656 --> 00:57:42,284
What's up, guys?

867
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:44,991
Why weren't they attacking you?

868
00:57:45,061 --> 00:57:46,824
They dig our sound, man.

869
00:57:46,896 --> 00:57:48,090
What?

870
00:57:48,164 --> 00:57:50,428
We were just in the garage,
jamming out.

871
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:51,899
And then all of a sudden
they came after us.

872
00:57:51,968 --> 00:57:54,368
And at first we were freaked,
but then we realized

873
00:57:54,437 --> 00:57:57,497
they were listening
to our music.

874
00:57:57,573 --> 00:58:00,940
The more I watched them,
the more I realized

875
00:58:01,010 --> 00:58:04,537
they're communicating
with each other like bugs, like...

876
00:58:04,614 --> 00:58:06,445
- Bees, dude. They're like bees.
- Yes.

877
00:58:06,516 --> 00:58:07,813
And we're like the queen bee.

878
00:58:07,884 --> 00:58:09,715
And then they hear us
and they tune in

879
00:58:09,786 --> 00:58:12,550
and then they check out.

880
00:58:12,622 --> 00:58:14,749
The more we started playing,
the more they started coming.

881
00:58:14,824 --> 00:58:17,019
That was, like,
five hours ago.

882
00:58:17,093 --> 00:58:20,187
You guys have been playing
for five hours straight?

883
00:58:20,263 --> 00:58:22,322
Hey, we needed
the practice.

884
00:58:22,398 --> 00:58:24,332
That's amazing.

885
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,027
It's okay.

886
00:58:26,102 --> 00:58:28,002
Oh, no, thanks.

887
00:58:28,071 --> 00:58:29,436
I'm high on life.

888
00:58:35,511 --> 00:58:37,445
Hoorah!

889
00:58:37,513 --> 00:58:39,743
Queers, make a hole.

890
00:58:39,816 --> 00:58:42,284
- Whew.
- Good job, Coach.

891
00:58:42,351 --> 00:58:44,285
Dude.

892
00:58:44,353 --> 00:58:46,821
- That was amazing.
- 10 years of training.

893
00:58:46,889 --> 00:58:49,050
- God bless America.
- Amen.

894
00:58:49,125 --> 00:58:51,059
We gotta shut that
power plant down.

895
00:58:51,127 --> 00:58:53,527
It's too late.
What's done is done.

896
00:58:53,596 --> 00:58:55,723
The only thing we can do now is
kill what it created.

897
00:58:55,798 --> 00:58:57,857
Yeah, so take these
and follow us.

898
00:58:57,934 --> 00:58:59,868
Thanks, babe,

899
00:58:59,936 --> 00:59:02,962
but we got our weapons.

900
00:59:17,553 --> 00:59:19,987
Apocalypse.

901
00:59:21,357 --> 00:59:24,190
Where did they all go?

902
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:26,524
Where do you think?

903
00:59:58,561 --> 01:00:00,825
Jimmy, look,
it's the sign-in book.

904
01:00:05,902 --> 01:00:07,836
Oh.

905
01:00:07,904 --> 01:00:11,032
Dude, that's Miss Raines,
my English teacher.

906
01:00:11,107 --> 01:00:13,075
Aw, I liked her.

907
01:00:39,569 --> 01:00:42,470
We're too late.

908
01:00:42,538 --> 01:00:44,665
Every zombie in town
is here.

909
01:00:46,909 --> 01:00:50,072
That's the guy from
the comic book store.

910
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:52,842
That's my mailman.

911
01:00:52,915 --> 01:00:55,782
You give me two minutes,
I'll have this school wired

912
01:00:55,852 --> 01:00:58,480
like a crackhead
drinking a Red Bull.

913
01:00:58,554 --> 01:01:01,682
Listen up. Here's what
we're gonna do.

914
01:01:01,757 --> 01:01:04,590
All right,

915
01:01:04,660 --> 01:01:06,685
here's the entrance.

916
01:01:06,762 --> 01:01:08,354
Here's the gymnasium.

917
01:01:08,431 --> 01:01:09,898
I'm gonna drop
some firecrackers

918
01:01:09,966 --> 01:01:11,900
right here, here and here.

919
01:01:11,968 --> 01:01:14,368
Now you kids, you're gonna have to
board up the entrances

920
01:01:14,437 --> 01:01:16,496
right here, here and here.

921
01:01:16,572 --> 01:01:18,972
We got one shot at this.

922
01:01:19,041 --> 01:01:21,509
So let's do it right.
You got it?

923
01:01:21,577 --> 01:01:23,044
- Yeah.
- All right, let's go.

924
01:01:25,915 --> 01:01:30,147
Adios, amigos.
We'll see you on the other side.

925
01:01:53,242 --> 01:01:55,176
That should hold it.

926
01:01:55,244 --> 01:01:57,041
Okay, good.

927
01:01:58,848 --> 01:02:00,645
Did you guys
hear that?

928
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:06,345
Stop pushing me.

929
01:02:11,928 --> 01:02:14,362
Please, don't hit us.
We're not one of them.

930
01:02:18,534 --> 01:02:21,833
It's okay. I'm Jules Ryder.
I'm here to rescue you.

931
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:27,172
They ate the prom king.

932
01:02:27,243 --> 01:02:30,337
It's okay.
I'm here to help.

933
01:02:30,413 --> 01:02:32,381
Thank you.

934
01:02:35,151 --> 01:02:38,518
It's okay.
You'll be all right.

935
01:02:38,587 --> 01:02:41,556
All right, everybody,
we're gonna get you out of here.

936
01:02:41,624 --> 01:02:43,558
I need you to stay together.
You got me?

937
01:02:43,626 --> 01:02:45,218
Stay together
if you want to live.

938
01:02:58,407 --> 01:03:00,136
All right, Dunn,

939
01:03:00,209 --> 01:03:02,541
I just gotta set
the roof explosives.

940
01:03:05,214 --> 01:03:07,148
Of course this shit
was a lot easier

941
01:03:07,216 --> 01:03:09,650
when I was
20 Ibs lighter.

942
01:03:12,188 --> 01:03:14,122
All right, Jimmy,
it's Hiroshima time.

943
01:03:14,190 --> 01:03:15,782
I just gotta
shimmy to safety

944
01:03:15,858 --> 01:03:17,792
and we'll turn this bitch
into Baghdad.

945
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:18,952
Oh, no!

946
01:03:19,028 --> 01:03:21,360
Shit!

947
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:25,533
Dunn, are you there?
Over.

948
01:03:25,601 --> 01:03:26,863
Go for Jimmy.

949
01:03:26,936 --> 01:03:28,369
I dropped the damn remote.

950
01:03:28,437 --> 01:03:30,200
The remote?

951
01:03:30,272 --> 01:03:31,967
The remote to set off
the explosives.

952
01:03:32,041 --> 01:03:34,134
It landed right in the damn plate
of potato chips.

953
01:03:34,210 --> 01:03:37,145
Son of a bitch.

954
01:03:37,213 --> 01:03:38,805
Dunn, you listen to me.

955
01:03:38,881 --> 01:03:40,712
You've got to get that remote.

956
01:03:40,783 --> 01:03:43,479
I'd go myself, but I got
one other charge I got to set

957
01:03:43,552 --> 01:03:46,077
and we got no time.
It's a one-way ticket, son,

958
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:48,453
but you gotta buy it.
Over.

959
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:54,759
I'm going in the gym.

960
01:03:54,830 --> 01:03:57,594
Are you nuts?

961
01:03:57,666 --> 01:04:00,726
Somebody's got to get
that remote.

962
01:04:00,803 --> 01:04:03,499
They're not gonna see me
if I stick to the shadows and move fast.

963
01:04:03,572 --> 01:04:05,403
Jules, get everybody
out of here

964
01:04:05,474 --> 01:04:07,408
and as far away from the school
as possible.

965
01:04:07,476 --> 01:04:09,467
- You got it.
- Jimmy, no.

966
01:04:11,580 --> 01:04:14,071
I'll be right back.

967
01:04:15,184 --> 01:04:16,913
Jimmy, please.

968
01:04:41,911 --> 01:04:44,379
All right, come on, let's go.
Move it, move it.

969
01:04:44,447 --> 01:04:46,881
This place is gonna blow.
Come on, let's go.

970
01:04:46,949 --> 01:04:48,246
Let's go, come on.

971
01:04:52,054 --> 01:04:53,988
Gwen!

972
01:04:59,462 --> 01:05:01,225
Gwen, are you okay?

973
01:05:01,297 --> 01:05:03,231
I'm fine.

974
01:05:12,942 --> 01:05:15,376
My helmet, Jules.
My helmet. I love you.

975
01:05:15,444 --> 01:05:17,241
I love you too, man,
but we gotta go.

976
01:05:17,313 --> 01:05:18,780
We gotta go.
Come on.

977
01:05:18,848 --> 01:05:20,475
It's all clear.
Let's go.

978
01:05:45,774 --> 01:05:48,106
- Hey.
- Lindsey, no.

979
01:05:48,177 --> 01:05:49,439
What are you doing?

980
01:05:49,512 --> 01:05:52,948
Jimmy, I'm not
leaving you again.

981
01:05:53,015 --> 01:05:54,949
Besides, I planned this prom.

982
01:05:55,017 --> 01:05:57,008
I'm not gonna miss it.

983
01:06:02,992 --> 01:06:04,983
You did a real good job
with this stuff, babe.

984
01:06:05,060 --> 01:06:07,585
Really?
Thanks.

985
01:06:09,165 --> 01:06:10,826
There it is.

986
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:14,358
Hold on.

987
01:06:14,436 --> 01:06:15,926
Let's go.

988
01:07:08,324 --> 01:07:11,054
- Jimmy.
- I'm here.

989
01:08:08,917 --> 01:08:12,250
Very slowly follow my lead.

990
01:08:12,321 --> 01:08:14,619
We have to find that remote.

991
01:08:22,898 --> 01:08:25,298
Not bad for a couple of queers.

992
01:08:36,445 --> 01:08:38,140
Do you see it?

993
01:08:38,213 --> 01:08:39,703
No. Do you?

994
01:09:12,181 --> 01:09:15,878
Jimmy, I'm sorry.

995
01:09:15,951 --> 01:09:19,614
You don't ever have to
tell me you're sorry.

996
01:09:27,963 --> 01:09:30,523
Let's go, come on.

997
01:09:30,599 --> 01:09:32,794
Steven, I need to talk to you.

998
01:09:32,868 --> 01:09:35,359
Gwen, the school
is about to explode.

999
01:09:35,437 --> 01:09:37,928
Steven, I need you.

1000
01:09:38,006 --> 01:09:39,132
Please.

1001
01:09:49,084 --> 01:09:50,915
Oh, Jeez.

1002
01:09:54,990 --> 01:09:57,458
Steven, please don't tell them.
They'll kill me.

1003
01:09:57,526 --> 01:09:59,494
Gwen...

1004
01:09:59,561 --> 01:10:01,495
Please, Steven.

1005
01:10:01,563 --> 01:10:03,497
I'm just so cold.

1006
01:10:03,565 --> 01:10:05,499
- Gwen.
- Just hold me, okay?

1007
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:07,558
Just hold me.

1008
01:10:11,974 --> 01:10:15,000
It's okay.

1009
01:10:15,077 --> 01:10:17,443
I'm not gonna
let them kill you.

1010
01:10:17,513 --> 01:10:20,038
I won't let you die.

1011
01:10:22,217 --> 01:10:23,514
I promise.

1012
01:10:27,856 --> 01:10:30,381
You're the best.

1013
01:10:33,929 --> 01:10:35,920
Please, Steven.

1014
01:11:08,697 --> 01:11:10,062
There it is.

1015
01:11:17,372 --> 01:11:18,999
Jensen, Jensen, plug it in.

1016
01:11:19,074 --> 01:11:21,042
Plug it in, man, plug it in!

1017
01:11:36,625 --> 01:11:38,490
Mitch?

1018
01:11:40,128 --> 01:11:42,119
Here we go again.

1019
01:11:42,197 --> 01:11:44,859
No no, Jimmy, Jimmy,
Mitch, Mitch!

1020
01:11:46,201 --> 01:11:47,896
Whoa whoa.

1021
01:11:55,244 --> 01:11:56,905
Jimmy!

1022
01:12:10,792 --> 01:12:13,090
Come on, come on, come on.

1023
01:12:16,064 --> 01:12:18,191
Take this.

1024
01:12:22,905 --> 01:12:25,271
Shit, it's the band.

1025
01:14:12,214 --> 01:14:14,682
We got the detonator.
Let's go.

1026
01:14:14,750 --> 01:14:17,241
No way, man.
This is the best set of our lives.

1027
01:14:17,319 --> 01:14:19,844
If you don't hurry up this is gonna be
the last set of your life.

1028
01:14:19,921 --> 01:14:21,821
Now come on.

1029
01:14:25,727 --> 01:14:28,025
Thank you, Cosa High School.
Good night.

1030
01:14:29,631 --> 01:14:31,565
Come on, come on,
come on.

1031
01:14:34,269 --> 01:14:36,601
Go go go!

1032
01:14:36,672 --> 01:14:38,799
Coach, is everybody out?

1033
01:14:38,874 --> 01:14:40,466
Everybody but me.
Count to 10.

1034
01:14:40,542 --> 01:14:42,510
Let's drop
those nukes.

1035
01:14:44,112 --> 01:14:46,546
- We locked those doors.
- That shit's not cool.

1036
01:14:46,615 --> 01:14:48,378
We're not gonna make it.

1037
01:14:48,450 --> 01:14:49,747
Get out of the way.

1038
01:14:49,818 --> 01:14:51,877
Safety glass.

1039
01:14:51,953 --> 01:14:54,786
- Jensen, come on, come on.
- Jimmy.

1040
01:14:59,227 --> 01:15:00,854
Jensen!

1041
01:15:07,803 --> 01:15:09,270
Oh!

1042
01:15:14,443 --> 01:15:17,674
- Go! Go!
- Go go go.

1043
01:15:20,782 --> 01:15:22,545
Push!

1044
01:15:22,617 --> 01:15:24,710
I'm slipping.

1045
01:15:28,457 --> 01:15:29,583
Hammond.

1046
01:15:42,170 --> 01:15:43,364
Jimmy.

1047
01:15:46,374 --> 01:15:48,103
Jimmy!

1048
01:16:10,799 --> 01:16:13,029
Come on.

1049
01:16:13,101 --> 01:16:15,467
- Come on.
- Everybody down!

1050
01:16:20,275 --> 01:16:22,641
Lindsey.

1051
01:16:22,711 --> 01:16:24,838
I love you.

1052
01:16:30,018 --> 01:16:32,782
Yes!

1053
01:16:39,594 --> 01:16:41,960
Hot damn, Dunn.
I was wrong about you.

1054
01:16:42,030 --> 01:16:43,463
You are a good soldier.

1055
01:16:43,532 --> 01:16:45,500
- Kick ass!
- Yeah!

1056
01:16:46,535 --> 01:16:49,129
Bring any marshmallows?

1057
01:16:49,204 --> 01:16:51,297
No, sir.

1058
01:16:51,373 --> 01:16:53,568
Steven.

1059
01:16:58,814 --> 01:17:02,341
Hey, congratulations
on winning prom queen.

1060
01:17:02,417 --> 01:17:04,817
Yeah.

1061
01:17:06,621 --> 01:17:08,452
Like it matters.

1062
01:17:08,523 --> 01:17:10,684
Tell me about it.

1063
01:17:11,726 --> 01:17:13,956
Who are you guys?

1064
01:17:19,901 --> 01:17:22,495
We're the Sci-Fi Club.

1065
01:17:23,738 --> 01:17:25,672
Really?

1066
01:17:25,740 --> 01:17:27,230
Do you believe in UFOs?

1067
01:17:27,309 --> 01:17:28,401
Yeah.

1068
01:17:28,476 --> 01:17:30,205
I saw one once.

1069
01:17:30,278 --> 01:17:32,041
Me too.

1070
01:17:32,113 --> 01:17:34,809
Wow, this is, you know...

1071
01:17:34,883 --> 01:17:36,043
Wow.

1072
01:17:36,117 --> 01:17:38,051
George...

1073
01:17:38,119 --> 01:17:40,314
no.

1074
01:17:42,224 --> 01:17:43,851
How are you?

1075
01:17:43,925 --> 01:17:45,859
I want to give you this.

1076
01:17:45,927 --> 01:17:47,861
It will protect you, just in case.

1077
01:17:47,929 --> 01:17:50,420
Okay.

1078
01:17:50,498 --> 01:17:52,966
You know what?
Actually, no.

1079
01:18:01,509 --> 01:18:04,478
We've got to shut down that power plant
before it spreads.

1080
01:18:04,546 --> 01:18:06,741
It's the way Jensen
would have wanted it.

1081
01:18:06,815 --> 01:18:08,806
Rock 'n' roll, brother.

1082
01:18:08,884 --> 01:18:11,148
Sounds like a plan,
pretty boy.

1083
01:18:11,219 --> 01:18:13,346
You in, ace?

1084
01:18:13,421 --> 01:18:15,218
Yes, sir.

1085
01:18:15,290 --> 01:18:18,589
Lindsey?

1086
01:18:18,660 --> 01:18:21,788
You go, I go.

1087
01:18:21,863 --> 01:18:24,423
All right, first things first...

1088
01:18:24,499 --> 01:18:26,831
the coach wants to go
to the pancake house.

1089
01:18:26,902 --> 01:18:30,235
There we'll all have
breakfast and juice on the coach.

1090
01:18:30,305 --> 01:18:33,433
Then we'll discuss
stage two of this op.

1091
01:18:33,508 --> 01:18:35,169
Sound good?

1092
01:18:35,243 --> 01:18:37,939
Pancakes are cool.

1093
01:18:38,013 --> 01:18:39,640
Roger that.

1094
