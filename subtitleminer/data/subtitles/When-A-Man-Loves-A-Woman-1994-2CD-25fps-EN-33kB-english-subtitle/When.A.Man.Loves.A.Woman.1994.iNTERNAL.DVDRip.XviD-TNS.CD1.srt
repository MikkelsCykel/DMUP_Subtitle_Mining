1
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:19,600
When a man loves a woman

2
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,200
Can't keep his mind
on nothin' else

3
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:28,600
He'll trade the world for
the good thing he's found

4
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:33,680
If she is bad he can't see it

5
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,400
She can do no wrong

6
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,600
Turn his back
on his best friend

7
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,680
If he put her down

8
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:48,080
When a man loves a woman

9
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,800
Spend his very last dime

10
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:56,800
Tryin' to hold on
to what he needs

11
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:02,000
He'll give up all his comforts

12
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:05,880
And sleep out in the rain

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,480
- If she said that's the way it ought to be
- Hey, that looks good.

14
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,280
That sandwich. Looks good.
You on your lunch hour?

15
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:18,600
When a man loves a woman

16
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,200
- Any news in the paper?
- Would you like to read a section of this?

17
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,480
No, thanks. I, uh,
actually read for a living.

18
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,200
- So, the last thing I want to be doing
on my lunch hour- - Oh, excuse me. - Hey!

19
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,200
- Sorry. Excuse me, miss.
- Yeah.

20
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,200
Baby, please don't treat me bad

21
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,280
- Okay?
- Yeah.

22
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:43,400
When a man loves a woman

23
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,000
- What?
- Where you going after this?

24
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:57,280
- Why would you be asking that?
- Ah, I am a pilot.

25
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,880
And I'm gonna barely make
my flight to Seattle-Tacoma...

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,400
and I haven't had a chance
to pick up my laundry.

27
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,880
- And?
- I thought you could pick it up for me.

28
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,080
Oh, I'd give you the money
and everything.

29
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,880
Here's the receipt and $30.
That should cover it.

30
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
What do you propose that I do with
your laundry after I pick it up?

31
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,880
Good question.

32
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,480
Here's the keys to my place.

33
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,880
The address is on the,
uh, little thing.

34
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,200
And I will be there
at about 12:30 and...

35
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,080
- you can bring it by then.
- After midnight?

36
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,080
- Uh, excuse me., Actually, sir, I was- - No,
no, hold on one second, one second, one second.

37
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,600
- If I could impose one further question.
- Okay.

38
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,480
Why wouldn't I drop off your
laundry at my convenience...

39
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,480
since I have your key?

40
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,680
Because then I wouldn't be able
to thank you properly.

41
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,600
Oh, I see.
And how would you do that?

42
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,880
I would give you something...

43
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,800
that you can take away with you.

44
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:13,200
- And what might that be?
- Oh, you want to know up front?

45
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,880
Oh, yeah.

46
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,480
Excuse me.

47
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,280
I bake.

48
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,880
You bake?

49
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,080
You bake!

50
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,800
You like... chocolate.

51
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,680
I'm allergic... to chocolate.

52
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,000
Do you like carrot cake?

53
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,880
Very much.

54
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,680
Well, then?

55
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,080
Cream cheese frosting?

56
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,000
My specialty.

57
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,880
- Check it out.
- Look.

58
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,680
She's so lucky.

59
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,800
- Jesus!
- Whoa.

60
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,880
Cable guy come this morning?

61
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,600
No? That's three weeks those kids
are without adult movies.

62
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,480
What a fuckin' world.

63
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,280
Hey, that looks good.

64
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,200
Is that Chablis?

65
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,400
Does anyone have, like,
a towel or something?

66
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,800
Now, this is you, inside.

67
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,600
Not inside the dress,
inside the body.

68
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,080
- How did I get in there?
- That's a whole other set of videos.

69
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,800
And they won't
let you watch those.

70
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,280
- Give me this.
- There you are.

71
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,480
Why wasn't your
real daddy there?

72
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:10,000
- You say the dumbest things.
- I'm four years old.

73
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,480
- Guys!
- Mom, can you tell her?

74
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,880
Oh! I married your daddy...

75
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,480
because he made me a cake
with cream cheese frosting.

76
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,480
That's how much he wanted me.

77
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,600
How come Daddy wanted you?

78
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,480
God, woman, just look at her.

79
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,600
Oop, late!
Second team, take over.

80
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:36,680
Porsche. Jesus, one more time.
Amy?

81
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,080
Jess has to do her homework tonight so
she doesn't leave it for the weekend.

82
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,680
Let's go. Amy, did you get that?

83
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,880
Which part were you
afraid I missed?

84
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
- Amy?
- Sorry.

85
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,880
Happy anniversary.

86
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,200
It's a press-on tattoo!

87
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,480
It says, "If found naked,
please return to Alice Green. "

88
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,280
It's to wear on trips so that the
stewardesses know you're spoken for.

89
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,000
- Flight attendants.
- Flight attendants, whatever.

90
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,000
Very thoughtful.

91
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,600
- I went over the 20 bucks.
- Oh, hey, I didn't go over the 20 bucks.

92
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,200
- Really?
- Yeah.

93
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,880
You rat.

94
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,200
That's incredible.

95
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,880
Now I'm gonna have to do
that thing to you tonight.

96
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,680
I think she wants you, baby.

97
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,080
- Hello, how're you doing?
- Fine.

98
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,600
- Mm, you're a good dancer.
- Thank you.

99
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,600
Ooh! Thanks.

100
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,880
- How was he?
- He was great!

101
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,880
Happy anniversary.

102
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,280
- Oh!
- What?

103
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,480
- Porsche again.
- Oh, honey.

104
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,800
Come here. No, no, no. Alice?

105
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,680
- Honey.
- Goddamn it.

106
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:44,400
Hey, it's 1:00 in the morning.
People are trying to have sex up here!

107
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,880
Alice, there's nobody down there.
You're talking to a car.

108
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,880
Goddamn it!

109
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,000
Alice.

110
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,680
- Alice.
- What a piece of shit. Damn it.

111
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,480
- Alice.
- Goddamn it. Shut up!

112
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,200
- Alice! Alice!
- Goddamn it!

113
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,280
- Alice, am I gonna like this?
- Here.

114
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,880
Shut up!

115
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,080
Shit!

116
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,400
Fucking foreign car!

117
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,600
Okay, batter up!

118
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,200
Right here! Hey, batter, batter,
batter, batter, batter, batter!

119
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,600
Right here. Come on,
baby. Let's go.

120
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,480
I'll start your shower.

121
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,480
You're not suggesting
I go to work?

122
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,400
Yes.

123
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,600
Okay. You promise
no one will be loud?

124
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,880
Six hundred kids? Sure.

125
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,080
Go on.

126
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,680
Get dressed, sugar.
We're runnin' late.

127
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,200
See, I'm not sure that
Matthew Wasserman's...

128
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:35,080
glance at your breasts rises to
the level of sexual harassment.

129
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,480
Well, what if he said,
"You know you want it. "

130
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,680
- Did he?
- No.

131
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,600
- But what if he did?
- Well, that would be closer.

132
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,880
I think if we can get him to lift up
your dress, we can put him away.

133
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,880
So, uh...

134
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,280
what is the deal with cutting
language lab- Shit!

135
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,480
Another self-mutilation day.

136
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:05,280
I'm checking on availability
for end-of-the-day wind-down.

137
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:10,400
Oh, come on. My problem's gotta
be more sordid than Shannon's.

138
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,000
Okay, a quick one.
Michael's got a trip.

139
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,800
Yes.

140
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,280
- Hi. - Hey. -
Where's Alice?

141
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,480
That's right, where's Alice?
Bye.

142
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,880
Amy! Amy! Amy, Amy, Amy, Amy,
Amy, Amy.

143
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:41,000
Listen, I, uh, got a trip.

144
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,680
I'm late, and Wayne's supposed to
meet me. I've got no way to call him.

145
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,280
He's waiting at my Lamaze class.
I just can't not show up. I-

146
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,600
Amy, Amy, uh, this is important.
I got a trip.

147
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,200
You're not saying my life
is less important?

148
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,280
Of course not.

149
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,080
I didn't think so. Bye.

150
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,080
She didn't come home.

151
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,680
I did notice that.

152
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:27,280
- I have a trip.
- What if she doesn't get back?

153
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,280
Well, I'll just go down to the corner
and offer the first person I see...

154
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,800
- five bucks to stay with you.
- Michael.

155
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,800
Okay, ten bucks.

156
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,200
You're so pretty.

157
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,080
Twenty minutes, lights out.

158
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,080
- Okay?
- Okay.

159
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,400
You're okay.

160
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,080
I've called everyone we know.

161
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,600
Hospitals, the school.

162
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,480
- You're up.
- I'm supposed to be up.

163
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,480
I'm just supposed to be
doing it in Chicago.

164
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,600
Hey! Stop that.

165
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,400
You got a trip.

166
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,480
Really?

167
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,200
I better get a move on.

168
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:52,080
I forgot that. I'm sorry.
I owe you a trip.

169
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,000
What happened?

170
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:03,680
- We went for a drink.
- Pam? - Yeah, Pam.

171
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,000
My friend. She needed me.
She needed to talk.

172
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,800
She needed me 'cause
Joe is an asshole.

173
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I'm glad she needed you 'cause
she's the one who got you.

174
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:15,000
- Nobody else got a fucking phone call.
- We were just talking.

175
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:18,400
She was crying and, and, uh-

176
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,000
Ah, when I looked at the time,
I just figured you were asleep.

177
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,680
So, uh-

178
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,480
I- I-I don't know how
I forgot the trip.

179
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,800
I don't know either.

180
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,480
Christ, Michael.

181
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,880
You don't know what I go through.
You don't have a fucking clue.

182
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:45,080
- What do you go through?
- My job, for one.

183
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,880
The girls and,
and running this place...

184
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,280
and I know a lot of women
go through the same thing...

185
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,280
but their husbands
aren't gone half the time.

186
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,200
I miss you...

187
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,400
when you go.

188
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,000
You got pressures,
you come to me.

189
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:22,600
Why do that to you? What are you
supposed to do with all that?

190
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,200
You let me worry about that.

191
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,800
I'm gonna trade Ed Buckley for a trip to
Mexico for a week and we're gonna disappear.

192
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,680
Would you like that?

193
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,080
Would you like to disappear?

194
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,880
Go get some candy from Grandpa.

195
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,080
And Mama Andretti.

196
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,800
Hello, Casey, Casey!
How are you?

197
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,880
Look what I got for you. See?

198
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,800
- I'm not staying with her.
- Hey, it's gonna be okay, honey.

199
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,400
Yeah, but she doesn't
care about us.

200
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,880
Listen, she's crazy about you,
and she's gonna spoil you rotten.

201
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,880
- Hi, Mom. How are you? Thanks for coming.
- Hello, Michael, dear.

202
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,280
- She still puts you down, and I don't like it.
- Hey.

203
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:13,280
You're gonna have to cut Grandma a little
bit of slack. She hasn't had the easiest life.

204
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,080
Jessica.

205
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,200
- How's my sweet angel?
- Oh, just fine, Mom.

206
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,680
- How are you?
- Have you lost weight?

207
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,680
- No. No.
- I guess you're just tired.

208
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,880
- Hello, Jessie.
- I wish I had time to be tired.

209
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,080
- Give me a smile. Come on. Give me a big smile!
- Walter!

210
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,600
- Don't let Michael carry all those bags in by himself!
- I'm sorry.

211
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,280
It's all right, Ma.
It's only two bags.

212
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,480
Give him the small one.
He likes to feel useful.

213
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,080
I got it, I got it.

214
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,680
Mom, can I get you anything before we
fly off and leave you with the kids?

215
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:49,480
The best thing you can do for me is just
have the grandest time in the world...

216
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,880
and come home rested, please?

217
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
- Hello. - Hey,
Dad! - You know what?

218
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,800
When Mama comes home, we're gonna
have a big surprise for her.

219
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,280
We're gonna have
the whole house clean.

220
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,880
Won't that be nice, huh?

221
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,080
- Thanks, I gotta go. Bye. Bye, girl.
- Bye.

222
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,000
- Thanks. Bye. Thanks.
- Bye. Have fun.

223
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,000
Safe trip.

224
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,000
- Bye, Mom. I love you! -
Bye, bye. - Love you! Bye!

225
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,880
- Okay, let's go.
- Don't clean too hard.

226
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,080
It's a press-on tattoo.

227
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,480
Just in case. You never know
what might happen in Mexico.

228
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,680
Found a guy at the beach
who'll watch us have sex.

229
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,680
Ooh.

230
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,680
- A local?
- Mm-hmm.

231
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,080
- Come on, honey.
- Ooh. Okay.

232
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,880
Come on.

233
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,880
Baby, gotta tell you something.

234
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,800
Listen.

235
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,600
I think we should do this
more often.

236
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:46,680
I do... because...

237
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:50,280
they paid you to fly here,
I got a pass...

238
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,280
the hotel
is a remarkable discount.

239
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,680
There are meals, as you've
said before, Johnny.

240
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,880
You gotta eat anyway,
so we can afford this.

241
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,480
- Not unless they comp the drinks.
- Ah.

242
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:08,200
What's that supposed
to mean, hmm?

243
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,280
- Hey. - You lookin' for a
fight, buster? - No, I'm not.

244
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,400
- Buster, buster. Wait, wait, wait. I got a bruise here.
- Sit down, Alice. Alice, please.

245
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,480
- Hey! Alice!
- If you wanna fight, I can give you...

246
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,280
- all the trouble you can handle.
- Sit down. Okay, great. I know you can.

247
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,880
Alice, sit down. Sit!

248
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,080
- Sit.
- Woof.

249
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,000
Alice! Alice!

250
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,280
I'm waiting for my spanking.

251
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,480
I know we have pressures.

252
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,880
And we need to have fun.

253
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:16,480
But wringing you out at the end of an
evening is less fun than it used to be.

254
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,600
And thinking back, it's been going on
for quite a while, Alice.

255
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,800
What's wrong, baby?

256
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,000
Can you talk about it?

257
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,480
You scared me last night.

258
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,480
Didn't you scare you?

259
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:59,080
Huh? What's gonna happen?

260
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,000
I'm gonna stop drinking
so much.

261
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,480
Last night was the best thing that
could've happened to straighten my ass out.

262
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,480
I promise you.

263
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,680
I promise me.

264
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,680
- Hey!
- Jessie! Ow!

265
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:39,080
- Pinatas!
- They're here!

266
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,680
- Oh, honey, don't get dirty.
- Casey!

267
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,280
- Hi- Hey!
- Someone's getting married.

268
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,680
Hi, pretty girl.

269
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,480
- Hi, Casey, honey.
- You look wonderful.

270
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,000
- Hey.
- Oh, my God, I hope those pinatas aren't full of candy.

271
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,280
- Let me take this for you, darling.
- Hi. Hi, Daddy.

272
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,600
- Hi. Wow, man. - Good to see
ya. - Hey, Pops, how are you?

273
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,080
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, honey.

274
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,880
- I smell Murphy's Oil.
- Yes, I used it a lot.

275
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,080
Shit!

276
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,880
Well, everything's fine
on the curb.

277
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:37,080
Garbage compulsion.
I feel much better now.

278
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,480
Come on, baby, it's late.

279
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,680
Casey.

280
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,480
You're not going to Dana's.

281
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,880
Case, I think we're gonna have to fill out
one of these homicide reports for Felicia.

282
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,480
- She's soaking off her make-up.
- Oh.

283
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:30,880
- Did I miss something?
- She didn't do her book report, so she can't go to Dana's.

284
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,480
- It's not due till Monday.
- I told you last night not to save it for the weekend...

285
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,600
- to make sure that you did it on-
- Good morning. Good morning.

286
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:42,000
Good morning. Good morning,
the first words out of our mouths.

287
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:49,080
I think we have all we can handle right
now with our coffee and our little spoon.

288
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:59,680
So, you go to Dana's, and the report
gets done first thing Saturday...

289
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:03,280
- and not last thing Sunday, okay?
- What's the difference?

290
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,280
The difference between me
helping you do it...

291
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,800
and me pulling your lungs out
through your belly button.

292
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:00,880
- Sorry I'm late.
- That's okay.

293
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,800
Um, Casey's taking a nap...

294
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,200
and Jess is teaching Samantha
how to use a computer.

295
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:12,400
- You all right?
- I- Whoa.

296
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,280
I had lunch at this Thai place,
and, uh...

297
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:20,400
something in the oil,
maybe, but-

298
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:23,400
I'll be fine. See you tomorrow.

299
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:27,200
Uh, Alice, um, I can call my mom. I'm
sure I can stay and make some supper.

300
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:30,880
I said, see you tomorrow.

301
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:34,400
- Alice, I think you should-
- Ah, ah, Amy.

302
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,080
Go home.

303
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,880
Okay?

304
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,080
Please!

305
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,280
Go home.

306
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,480
You get some rest.

307
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,600
And I'll call you
a little later.

308
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:02,800
Mom, look. Samantha drew
a Buick on the computer.

309
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,000
- It's green.
- Do your homework.

310
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,480
Mom?

311
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,080
Mom?

312
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:43,280
- Mom, are you sick?
- I said...

313
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,200
do your homework!

314
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,480
Mom, are you sick?

315
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:20,800
I did my homework!
That's all I wanted to tell you!

316
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,880
Good girl.

317
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,680
Jess!

318
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,880
Mom?

319
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,200
Mom?

320
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:48,200
Is there a Michael Green?
Michael Green?

321
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,480
- Switchboard tracking you down, I guess.
- Thank you.

322
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,680
Hello.

323
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,200
Jess, what's the matter, honey?

324
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:01,000
- Mommy died.
- What?

325
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,600
She just fell through
the shower door and...

326
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,280
all the glass is all shattered
and on the floor...

327
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,680
and she's laying
in the middle of it.

328
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,400
Jess, listen to me. I'm gonna have
somebody over there right away.

329
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,000
- You understand?
- Okay.

330
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,880
- Okay? And I'm gonna call you right back.
- Okay.

331
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,880
I need an outside line.

332
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:30,280
- I need an outside line!
- Sir.

333
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,880
Hi.

334
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,400
You're all right.

335
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,280
Doctor says.

336
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,480
How's Jess?

337
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,680
She's really happy you're okay.

338
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,680
I hit her hard, Michael.

339
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,680
- I hit her so hard.
- It's all right.

340
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,600
She's fine.

341
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,800
We're gonna get you better
so it doesn't happen again.

342
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,680
All right?

343
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:49,400
- God, just don't hate me.
- Mmm.

344
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,680
Because I'll die if you do.

345
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,480
That thought would
never enter my mind.

346
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,600
I start at 4:00 in the morning,
and it goes all day.

347
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,680
I drink in the john, I drink...

348
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:12,680
in the closet, and I drink in
the kids' room when they're not there.

349
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:19,280
You know how when we...
go out to the car...

350
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:22,880
- and I have to go back
inside for a second? - Mm-hmm.

351
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,880
I have to be high
to do anything.

352
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,680
And I'm scared all the time.

353
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:39,080
- I drank for Casey's goddam birthday party.
- So did I.

354
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,200
I drink a quart a day.

355
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,600
It's vodka, so you
couldn't smell it.

356
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:58,200
How come I didn't see this?

357
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,080
Because I hid it.

358
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,480
You were scared.

359
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,480
- What am I gonna do?
- We'll figure it out.

360
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,280
I don't want you
to worry about it.

361
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,800
I'm gonna find you
the best treatment...

362
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,680
the best in the fucking world.

363
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,400
You're not alone, honey. Never.

364
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,000
Never.

365
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:57,080
- Okay, girls, I'll see you later.
- Bye.

366
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,280
- Mommy. - Amy. - Oh, I'll
just wait in the kitchen.

367
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,600
Okay.

368
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,480
So...

369
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:14,800
we'll talk on the phone
and you'll come see me.

370
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,080
- And then I'll be home.
- And we'll go to the beach?

371
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:28,400
- Are you gonna take care of your sister?
- I'm gonna take care of Daddy.

372
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,080
Sorry, baby.

373
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,480
It will never happen again.

374
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,000
Mommy loves you.

375
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,200
- That's us.
- Hi.

376
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,880
Uh, we're Alice Green.

377
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,080
Hi. Welcome.

378
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:35,000
Alice, before we check you in,
I need to look through your bag.

379
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:38,480
Is that all right with you?
It's strictly routine.

380
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,400
We've got all your
paperwork, so...

381
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:54,000
everything's ready.
Um, sorry.

382
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,480
So, come on, Alice,
and we'll get you checked in.

383
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,480
Just Alice.

384
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,400
Give me a minute.

385
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,000
I'll call you tonight.

386
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,800
- I'm sorry. There's no phone calls.
- Excuse me, uh-

387
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,480
She's my wife. She can call me
whenever she needs to call me.

388
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,800
She'll be in detox
until Tuesday...

389
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,880
and she'll be busy getting well.

390
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,480
She'll call you as soon
as she can after that.

391
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,400
I love you.

392
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,880
I love you.

393
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:14,880
I can hear her heart beat

394
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,480
From a thousand miles

395
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:21,000
Yeah, the heavens open

396
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:24,080
Every time she smiles

397
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:28,800
And when I come to her

398
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,400
That's where I belong

399
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:35,600
And I'm runnin' to her

400
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:38,280
Like a love song

401
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,480
She gimme love, love, love, love

402
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,200
Crazy love

403
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:49,280
She gimme love, love, love, love

404
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:52,280
Crazy love

405
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:56,480
She gimme love, love, love, love

406
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,680
Crazy love

407
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,480
Jess?

408
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:05,080
It's 6:00 in the morning.

409
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,080
Kids are unbelievable.

410
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,480
First she wants French toast,
then she wants tuna.

411
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,680
And then she wants
a cucumber sandwich.

412
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,200
Case!

413
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,400
Wanna know what
she finally eats?

414
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:24,000
- She ate fruit.
- She ate fruit.

415
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:26,080
Right.

416
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:29,000
My hair hurts.

417
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,400
Casey, is that you?

418
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,680
- Oh! God.
- I did her hair.

419
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:39,800
Oh, I like it.
Let's see that hairdo.

420
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,480
Ooh, that's a little tight there.
Let me see that.

421
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,280
- Ow!
- Ooh, sorry!

422
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:48,800
- Mommy does it better.
- Oh, Mommy does everything better.

423
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:52,280
She cooks better, she looks better,
she kisses better.

424
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,880
Mommy's a better person.

425
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:58,000
You know, I bet you have
a lot of questions...

426
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:00,480
things you're feeling
about Mommy.

427
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,400
We could talk about that.

428
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,400
See, like if you're sad or
scared or angry or something...

429
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,800
- you could just-
- What's a alcoholic?

430
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:18,280
Someone with a bad habit, you know, like
if you drank stuff that made you sick.

431
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:23,200
But you really liked it, so you kept
drinking it and it kept making you sick.

432
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,880
Wouldn't you want
to learn how to stop?

433
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:32,680
- What's a alcoholic?
- It's why she does all that stuff.

434
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,480
When she does all that stuff,
like when she talks like she's sleepy...

435
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:41,000
forgets stuff,
and when she's sad.

436
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:42,880
When she cries?

437
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,480
She cries in the bathroom.

438
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:02,200
She, she did that a lot,
I bet, huh?

439
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,680
Your hair is so pretty.

440
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:18,000
You know, Mommy can't wait
to get back just to brush it?

441
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,480
I got it. Alice?

442
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:35,600
I'm Dr Mendez.
I'm a counsellor.

443
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:38,080
You know you're supposed
to be in community now?

444
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,480
Your nurse said you've
got a problem?

445
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,600
No problem.
I don't have any problems.

446
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,480
- You think I have a problem?
- Yeah, at least.

447
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:51,480
I just want to make a phone call. I just
want to make a phone call to my husband.

448
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:54,480
If you wanted to make a phone call to your
husband, would you call that a problem?

449
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:57,080
No, but I'm not in detox
dealing with an addiction.

450
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:00,680
- Look, we'll let you make a
phone call, as soon as- - Now!

451
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:04,080
- Now is when I want to call him!
Now! Can you understand that? - Alice-

452
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:08,600
- Alice, look-
- Can you understand fucking anything?

453
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:10,480
Yeah.

454
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:12,400
I can.

455
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:18,000
Two more days, hon.
You can do this.

456
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:20,080
Hang in.

457
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:22,080
Come on.

458
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,400
Hello.

459
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:04,000
- Michael.
- Alice?

460
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:08,080
- Alice?
- Yeah.

461
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,080
You can call.

462
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:14,200
Yeah. What do you know?
They let me use the phone.

463
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:17,600
How was detox?

464
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:21,280
It was nifty, you know.

465
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:25,000
- I threw up like a good girl.
- Great.

466
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:28,280
Hard part's over, baby.

467
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:34,880
Yeah, the hard part's over.
Party time.

468
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:39,280
Well, so, uh...

469
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:43,400
basically, I just, uh,
sit around and...

470
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:49,280
think of you naked because,
you know, you have this...

471
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:51,280
amazing body.

472
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,080
You still do, don't you?

473
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,680
State of the art.

474
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,080
So, you'd be, what,
65 pounds now?

475
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:16,080
Honey.

476
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,000
Alice.

477
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:20,000
Honey, you there?

478
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:23,280
Alice.

479
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:28,480
Yeah.

480
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:31,880
Everyone here is
pulling for you.

481
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:37,280
Alice, they say they tear
you down the first two weeks...

482
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:39,600
so they can build you back up.

483
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,080
- Alice.
- God, I'm sorry, baby.

484
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:54,280
It's just so hard.

485
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:02,600
- Honey, are you there?
- Yeah.

486
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,480
I'm here, baby.

487
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:07,880
I love you.

488
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,880
I miss you.

489
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,400
Listen, I'll see you, um,
I'll see you on Sunday.

490
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:20,600
- Okay?
- The kids are so excited to see you.

491
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:22,880
I can't talk for too long
because there's, um...

492
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,280
one phone and a whole line
of people, so-

493
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:31,600
Can you bring
my grey sweatsuit?

494
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:33,480
Yes.

495
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,680
I'm just, uh, running down
my list...

496
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:44,080
of dumb things to say
right now.

497
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,800
Good for you.

498
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,480
You're supposed to wrap it.

499
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:06,800
- What?
- In a newspaper or a paper bag.

500
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,200
So nobody sees it or something.

501
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,480
Mommy tell you that?

502
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:48,080
Hey.

503
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:50,080
You wanna do one?

504
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,800
Come on. Take your pick.

505
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:05,880
Vodka, huh?

506
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,000
All right.

507
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:53,280
Let me see.

508
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:56,080
Now if Mommy cries
when she sees you...

509
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:58,280
it's because
you're beautiful.

510
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,280
Okay?

511
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,200
Piggyback?

512
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:09,680
Oh, the purse. Ready?

513
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:19,480
- Where is she?
- I don't know. We'll see.

514
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:21,600
She said she'd be out here.

515
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:26,080
There she is.
Do you see her in the hat?

516
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:30,480
Mommy! Mommy!

517
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,200
Mommy.

518
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:37,880
Mommy.

519
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,280
Hi, baby.

520
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,200
Hey.

521
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:55,280
Say hi to Mommy.

522
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,800
- Hi, beautiful girl. Hi.
- Hi.

523
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:07,000
You want to take 'em for a walk
and I'll catch up later?

524
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,200
- Hmm? Bye-bye.
- Thank you.

525
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:13,080
- Okay.
- Come on, you guys. Let's go.

526
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:20,400
Art Braun left alone.

527
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,280
- Nice shot.
- Excuse me. Can you get some coffee in here?

528
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:27,200
What do I look like,
a fuckin' waitress?

529
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:30,000
Try the striped in the side.

530
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:36,080
Hey! I saw you with Alice.

531
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:38,080
You're her significant other.

532
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:40,280
Good to meet you, man.
Your wife's amazing. Malcolm.

533
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,480
- Oh, uh, Michael.
- Yeah, Michael.

534
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:44,280
- Good to know- Come on in. - How
are ya? No, I got the kids outside.

535
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,200
- Uh-uh. That's okay. This is Earl.
- Hey, I'm Earl.

536
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,080
- Hi, Earl. Michael.
- Hiya. Watch the game.

537
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:50,200
- No, I-I got the kids outside. Okay.
- Have a seat, man.

538
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:53,280
- Myers shooting at 50% tonight.
- Well, there's that middleman.

539
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:56,480
- Blalock is still on him. - Hi.
How ya doin'? - Good. How are ya?

540
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:58,880
...moved up the lane,
opened up that soft spot.

541
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,200
It's clear
on the other side there-

542
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:10,800
- Come on, Malcolm.
- Been a while since you watched a game without a beer?

543
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:13,480
- Me?
- You.

544
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:16,880
Actually, uh, I don- I don-
I don't, uh, drink much.

545
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,680
Can you believe that, man?

546
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:27,680
I been there, man. Denial.

547
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:30,200
- Jesus.
- Ain't just a river in Egypt.

548
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:32,600
- Hey, shut up!
- Cork it, Danny.

549
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:35,480
Are you guys sayin' that
this dude don't drink?

550
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:40,200
- I'm sayin' shut the fuck up, man!
- Fellas. Fellas, my fault.

551
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:43,480
Hey. It's a cunning,
baffling disease, man.

552
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:45,600
The man doesn't have a problem,
pecker-face. You do!

553
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:47,880
Cunning and baffling disease.

554
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,000
- Save it for group, man. Save it for group.
- Yeah!

555
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:55,080
- Nah, not in group, Earl.
- Save it for group, all right? Yo, Earl, man.

556
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,880
- I like your new friends.
- Oh, d'you meet Malcolm?

557
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:01,280
- Big black guy.
- Cokehead.

558
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:04,280
- We hit it off.
- The girls are with him.

559
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,880
Right now?

560
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,800
Oh, come on, Michael.
He's not a child molester.

561
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:13,680
He's an armed robber.

562
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:26,400
What?

563
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,080
Well.

564
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:35,680
Whatever you think of these people,
Michael, think that of me, because it fits.

565
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:44,480
- I thought you'd quit.
- I did.

566
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:49,680
Malcolm and I, um...

567
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:53,080
really talk, you know?

568
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,480
Talk about everything.

569
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:58,680
Everything.

570
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:02,600
We have a lot in common, and the
truth is that right- right now...

571
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:05,000
I really need these people.

572
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:09,600
I'm glad you have 'em.

573
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:12,280
And when you come home,
you'll have me.

574
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:21,280
What's wrong, Alice?

575
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:24,680
Hmm? You were fine when the kids
were around. What's wrong?

576
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:27,880
Long day.

577
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:33,280
- Hey.
- Hi.

578
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:35,800
Gary, this is Michael.

579
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:39,480
Hi.

580
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:43,480
- Feel like I know you.
- Oh, yeah?

581
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:47,400
Yeah. Your wife's
a very comforting person.

582
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:50,200
- Yes.
- Very.

583
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:53,080
Do you mind if I talk
to her for a second?

584
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:55,680
- No. - I just need-
Just for a second.

585
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:57,800
- I'll just be one second. What's the matter?
- Okay.

586
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Uh-

587
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:02,280
I'm sorry.

588
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:16,880
Sheila... called me.
