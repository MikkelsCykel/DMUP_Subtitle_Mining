00:00:17,877 --> 00:00:21,088
Warrior representation. Yes.

2
00:00:22,256 --> 00:00:26,343
No means no! No means no!
No means no!

3
00:01:00,419 --> 00:01:03,130
I'm a freshman.

4
00:01:05,674 --> 00:01:07,843
And....

5
00:01:11,514 --> 00:01:14,016
I was raped.

6
00:01:14,975 --> 00:01:16,352
No, we didn't.

7
00:01:16,518 --> 00:01:18,479
We'll have to think about
what we're doing next week.

8
00:01:18,646 --> 00:01:21,440
-You look cute.
-Do I?

9
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:36,705
Happy Halloween, brother!

10
00:01:36,872 --> 00:01:41,752
Be sure and stay away from the white
girls from now on. I know you will.

11
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,891
What are you doing?
Let's go get some fucking candy!

12
00:01:56,058 --> 00:01:59,103
-That was awesome.
-It was good.

13
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:02,398
There are things
we could've done better...

14
00:02:02,564 --> 00:02:06,026
...but I was proud of you.

15
00:02:06,193 --> 00:02:08,612
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

16
00:02:09,446 --> 00:02:12,908
-I feel so much better now.
-Good.

17
00:02:13,075 --> 00:02:16,370
Look, you know, I could just--

18
00:02:16,537 --> 00:02:19,581
Why don't I just stay
with you tonight?

19
00:02:22,126 --> 00:02:26,463
We could stay up and talk or....

20
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:29,133
What do you think?

21
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,678
Are you sure you're ready for that?

22
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:41,353
Don't do it just because
you're fascinated.

23
00:02:44,064 --> 00:02:47,026
I want you to be sure.

24
00:02:49,528 --> 00:02:51,071
Good night.

25
00:02:52,281 --> 00:02:54,491
Good night.

26
00:03:01,957 --> 00:03:04,042
So...

27
00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:07,129
...what's up with your friend?

28
00:03:07,337 --> 00:03:11,633
-She's weird.
-She's not weird. She's just different.

29
00:03:11,842 --> 00:03:17,598
Yeah, and I bet she wants to show you
just how different she can be, huh?

30
00:03:17,973 --> 00:03:20,601
I'm tired of running and studying.

31
00:03:20,768 --> 00:03:24,271
It's too hard to do both.
I feel like a slave.

32
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,692
They wouldn't give a fuck about me
if I wasn't running for this school.

33
00:03:28,859 --> 00:03:32,696
I'm tired of feeling
like a thoroughbred.

34
00:03:32,863 --> 00:03:35,824
Why you always gotta
take stuff so far?

35
00:03:35,991 --> 00:03:40,204
People would die to be where you are,
and you tripping.

36
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:46,043
You have the opportunity to go
to school, and it's here. So take it.

37
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:50,881
I don't see security stopping you
on campus to see your I.D.

38
00:03:51,048 --> 00:03:53,759
You're all hunky-dory
with your scholarship.

39
00:03:53,926 --> 00:03:56,887
They'll let that harmless black woman
through easier than a man.

40
00:03:57,054 --> 00:03:59,806
-So you think I got it easy?
-Hell, yeah.

41
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:03,894
-Easier than me.
-You know them girls I stay with?

42
00:04:04,102 --> 00:04:08,982
Every time something comes up missing,
who you think they look at?

43
00:04:09,191 --> 00:04:11,818
-And?
-I feel like fighting.

44
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:14,988
-I feel like beating people up.
-Why don't you?

45
00:04:15,155 --> 00:04:19,743
It's a waste of time.
lnstead, I fight with this:

46
00:04:20,285 --> 00:04:21,828
And I'm getting mine.

47
00:04:23,121 --> 00:04:27,709
You gotta stop doing this all the time:
And start doing this:

48
00:04:28,418 --> 00:04:31,421
Quit worrying about
what people are thinking.

49
00:04:31,588 --> 00:04:34,132
Yeah, but it still ain't the same.

50
00:04:34,675 --> 00:04:36,009
Listen.

51
00:04:38,929 --> 00:04:42,683
You a woman.
I'm a black man.

52
00:04:43,976 --> 00:04:46,186
You're safe.

53
00:04:46,937 --> 00:04:50,065
I'm a threat, educated or not.

54
00:04:51,149 --> 00:04:52,818
You ain't educated yet.

55
00:04:53,151 --> 00:04:54,611
Crazy!

56
00:06:22,741 --> 00:06:25,118
Hey. Kristen.

57
00:06:35,212 --> 00:06:39,216
-Can we talk?
-Sure. Here?

58
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:50,227
-Don't put too much lipstick on.
-Why not?

59
00:06:50,393 --> 00:06:55,106
You don't want to look like a tramp.
You'll look desperate.

60
00:06:55,273 --> 00:06:58,360
Here, blot it some.

61
00:07:02,072 --> 00:07:06,701
-Is that better?
-Yeah, yeah. Yeah, like that.

62
00:07:06,952 --> 00:07:10,163
Is that him?
Well, all right, Kristen.

63
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:14,834
I was getting worried about you.

64
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:25,303
-Where'd you get these, man?
-A buddy of mine in law enforcement.

65
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:28,557
Fucking gun-control department.

66
00:07:30,642 --> 00:07:32,102
These guns all suck.

67
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:36,398
It don't matter as long as
they do the job.

68
00:07:36,898 --> 00:07:40,402
-Do you want a beer?
-Yeah.

69
00:07:42,737 --> 00:07:44,823
Check this out, man.

70
00:07:46,992 --> 00:07:48,994
This is a gun, man.

71
00:07:50,328 --> 00:07:53,915
-Glock 9 mm.
-Shut up.

72
00:07:54,124 --> 00:07:57,794
Pumped gas two years
to buy this. Laser sighting.

73
00:07:57,961 --> 00:08:02,507
Fucking Rambo, man!
No way I can miss.

74
00:08:03,675 --> 00:08:07,470
-This is power.
-Don't point that fucking shit at me!

75
00:08:07,637 --> 00:08:11,891
I know how to handle guns, man.
I been shooting since I was 9.

76
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:16,187
Don't ever point a gun at me
ever again. You'll be sorry.

77
00:08:16,646 --> 00:08:19,024
Who taught you how to shoot?

78
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:22,569
-My pa.
-Your pa?

79
00:08:22,777 --> 00:08:28,158
My pa's a survivalist.
Used to kick my ass every day.

80
00:08:28,325 --> 00:08:32,329
He's always talking about
the world coming to an end.

81
00:08:33,496 --> 00:08:35,498
Do you like to hike?

82
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:39,002
I've never really tried it.

83
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:43,631
Yeah? You should go.
Around here there's beautiful hills.

84
00:08:43,798 --> 00:08:49,179
I try and go everyday. I was there
this morning. The light was beautiful.

85
00:08:49,346 --> 00:08:52,515
What if there's snakes?
Hey, Monet.

86
00:08:52,682 --> 00:08:53,808
Hey.

87
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:59,147
-How's it going?
-Cool. You all right?

88
00:08:59,314 --> 00:09:01,441
Yeah, I'm fine.

89
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:04,194
-Hi, Taryn.
-Hi, Monet. How you doing?

90
00:09:05,236 --> 00:09:10,992
-See you later.
-Yeah, see you guys later. Bye.

91
00:09:14,621 --> 00:09:16,623
Girl!

92
00:09:21,419 --> 00:09:24,547
I like it that you understand me.

93
00:09:27,008 --> 00:09:29,761
There are things that...

94
00:09:31,888 --> 00:09:35,391
...I don't have to say because...

95
00:09:37,685 --> 00:09:40,688
...you just know how I feel.

96
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:23,439
That was nice.

97
00:10:28,653 --> 00:10:31,072
I think you're nice.

98
00:10:54,012 --> 00:10:56,097
You're trembling.

99
00:10:56,431 --> 00:10:57,974
Are you afraid?

100
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:01,477
Yes.

101
00:11:08,318 --> 00:11:09,861
Why?

102
00:11:11,988 --> 00:11:14,616
I won't hurt you.

103
00:11:16,117 --> 00:11:20,330
I don't want you to do anything
that you don't wanna do.

104
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:40,433
I know.

105
00:11:49,567 --> 00:11:51,986
I want to.

106
00:11:59,369 --> 00:12:01,371
Are you ready?

107
00:12:09,712 --> 00:12:11,714
Just a second.

108
00:12:28,407 --> 00:12:31,869
As a black man in America,
my stress comes from everywhere.

109
00:12:32,036 --> 00:12:35,873
Recognize.
Take a look around you.

110
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,460
Look at this.
Columbus disgusts me.

111
00:12:39,627 --> 00:12:43,255
Fool wasn't nothing but a thief,
mass murderer.

112
00:12:43,422 --> 00:12:49,136
Slaughtered Native Americans, we got a
holiday and a university named for him?

113
00:12:49,303 --> 00:12:52,264
We're supposed to be learning their
westernised thoughts...

114
00:12:52,431 --> 00:12:55,768
...only to learn that in their eyes,
we're lower class. Always.

115
00:12:56,018 --> 00:12:57,770
Class is a state of mind.

116
00:12:58,229 --> 00:13:02,483
History's proven you can be
the smartest, run the fastest...

117
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:05,194
...they still think we inferior.

118
00:13:08,614 --> 00:13:10,700
What's that shirt, man?

119
00:13:10,866 --> 00:13:13,536
You support the Black Panthers?

120
00:13:13,994 --> 00:13:17,790
-Yeah. And?
-That's reverse racism, man.

121
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:20,167
1995, coon.

122
00:13:20,334 --> 00:13:22,294
-What?
-Malik, come on--

123
00:13:23,254 --> 00:13:24,713
-What?
-Stop.

124
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,676
I'm gonna kick your ass,
whatever ass you got left, fool!

125
00:13:29,593 --> 00:13:33,305
Yeah, all right.
You can run, but you can't hide!

126
00:13:33,514 --> 00:13:37,309
<i>"The sharp separating wall
between master and slave fell.</i>

127
00:13:37,476 --> 00:13:41,439
<i>The Aryan gave up the purity of his
blood and, therefore, he also lost...</i>

128
00:13:41,605 --> 00:13:45,109
<i>... the place in the paradise
he had created for himself.</i>

129
00:13:45,276 --> 00:13:50,197
<i>He became submerged in the
race mixture. He gradually lost--"</i>

130
00:14:07,673 --> 00:14:09,258
What's up, man?

131
00:14:15,514 --> 00:14:20,352
Man, I gotta admit, you've been real
polite about staying out of my way.

132
00:14:21,061 --> 00:14:22,813
But you ain't been honest.

133
00:14:23,772 --> 00:14:30,070
I figure, it ain't what a person say,
it's what they think.

134
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:32,156
So in my mind...

135
00:14:32,323 --> 00:14:35,826
...you been walking around calling me
a nigger in your head.

136
00:14:36,327 --> 00:14:37,620
Am I right?

137
00:14:38,412 --> 00:14:41,790
-I don't have nothing to say to you.
-I think you do.

138
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:46,212
Say what you feel.
You think I'm a nigger?

139
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:49,423
Then be a man and call me one
to my face.

140
00:14:59,934 --> 00:15:05,481
You're just a punk-ass white boy
with a fucked-up haircut.

141
00:15:05,856 --> 00:15:07,691
Bitch.

142
00:15:17,826 --> 00:15:19,370
Fuck!

143
00:15:29,797 --> 00:15:31,298
Fuck!

144
00:15:44,561 --> 00:15:48,190
Fuck you!
You don't fucking scare me!

145
00:17:12,774 --> 00:17:17,362
This is fucked-up.
This is really fucked-up.

146
00:17:18,489 --> 00:17:20,824
What's wrong with you?

147
00:17:20,991 --> 00:17:24,411
I don't give a shit
what you do with your stuff...

148
00:17:24,578 --> 00:17:27,289
...but this is my stuff, man!

149
00:17:27,456 --> 00:17:30,459
-Know how selfish that is?
-What are you gonna do?

150
00:17:30,626 --> 00:17:35,047
Jeez, I don't know. I'm gonna
kick your ass. What does that mean?

151
00:17:35,214 --> 00:17:38,842
Why don't you get your shit
and move out, man?

152
00:17:39,009 --> 00:17:42,304
Excuse me?
Why don't I get my shit and move out?

153
00:17:42,512 --> 00:17:45,599
-You moved in here.
-What are you gonna do?

154
00:17:45,766 --> 00:17:48,101
Look, why don't we just sit down?

155
00:17:48,268 --> 00:17:51,939
Why don't we just fucking
stop this and talk about it?

156
00:17:52,105 --> 00:17:55,359
I don't wanna talk to you.
I don't need to talk.

157
00:17:55,525 --> 00:17:57,444
Don't you know I'm superior to you?

158
00:17:57,611 --> 00:18:00,697
Don't you know I came
from the master race?

159
00:18:01,156 --> 00:18:05,702
-You're nothing. Don't tell me what--
-Get off, crazy motherfucker!

160
00:18:05,869 --> 00:18:08,914
All right, motherfucker?
Go to sleep.

161
00:18:09,081 --> 00:18:13,835
Calm your ass down. Calm down.
What is wrong with you, man?

162
00:18:15,712 --> 00:18:18,048
-What's going on?
-I gotta get out of here.

163
00:18:18,215 --> 00:18:19,675
-Fuck you!
-What the fuck?

164
00:18:19,841 --> 00:18:22,803
You damn Jews and niggers
stick together.

165
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:26,181
You all work against me,
the pure, white, Christian man.

166
00:18:26,348 --> 00:18:30,143
Don't you know he controls you, nigger?
You ain't nothing without them.

167
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:32,813
You're nothing!
You're a slave.

168
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:37,776
I'll take my fucking belt off, man.
I'll make you my fucking monkey.

169
00:18:37,943 --> 00:18:39,903
-Get on the floor.
-Relax.

170
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:41,655
Get on the floor!

171
00:18:41,822 --> 00:18:45,033
You're not white.
You're Jewish. You're nothing.

172
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,911
You're not me!
What are you gonna do?

173
00:18:48,078 --> 00:18:51,581
Dirty nigger.
Got something to say now?

174
00:18:51,748 --> 00:18:55,377
I'm not fooling.
You got something to say now?

175
00:18:55,544 --> 00:18:59,548
-Jesus Christ! Fucking relax!
-Who's the man now, big man?

176
00:18:59,715 --> 00:19:04,136
Fucking hotshot ape.
You're nothing, Malik! You're nothing!

177
00:19:04,302 --> 00:19:07,764
You're dead. You're dead.

178
00:19:17,691 --> 00:19:19,735
Don't move, fucker.

179
00:19:24,823 --> 00:19:28,243
You're all gonna die.
You're gonna die, monkey!

180
00:19:30,036 --> 00:19:34,124
He had a fucking gun!
A fucking gun!

181
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:38,628
I'm gonna call secur-- He broke the
phone. We gotta call security.

182
00:19:38,795 --> 00:19:41,965
-I'm gonna get this fool!
-Where are you going?

183
00:19:52,267 --> 00:19:55,020
-Stop. Not so fast.
-Get out of my way.

184
00:19:55,228 --> 00:19:58,482
I'm trying to catch this dude
who just pulled a gun on me!

185
00:19:58,648 --> 00:20:02,402
-Let's see I.D.
-You don't need no I.D.! Out of my way!

186
00:20:10,952 --> 00:20:14,998
No! That's the wrong guy!
That's the wrong guy!

187
00:20:15,165 --> 00:20:18,126
-Who are you?
-Get the fuck out of here!

188
00:20:26,384 --> 00:20:30,514
Charlie, look what I found
in the kid's room.

189
00:20:31,806 --> 00:20:35,268
You believe this?
Do me a favour, will you?

190
00:20:35,435 --> 00:20:40,023
See if you can find a name or a picture
or an I.D. in his room.

191
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:41,900
You bet.

192
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:49,282
All right, let's break it up.
Everything is fine now.

193
00:20:49,449 --> 00:20:53,078
What do you mean, " Break it up"?
Look at those white folks there.

194
00:20:53,245 --> 00:20:55,330
You ain't telling them to go.

195
00:20:55,538 --> 00:21:00,210
White boy pull a gun out in his face
and you ask us to break it up?

196
00:21:00,377 --> 00:21:04,214
Y'all got some nerves.
Fuck you! We ain't going nowhere.

197
00:21:04,381 --> 00:21:08,760
If they can stand over there together,
we can stand here together.

198
00:21:08,969 --> 00:21:14,933
Now you go find the asshole
that pulled a gun on this man's face.

199
00:21:17,644 --> 00:21:21,690
Get those kids to move out
so we can clear this area.

200
00:21:21,856 --> 00:21:24,442
Okay, let's go.
Break it up. Come on.

201
00:21:24,609 --> 00:21:28,280
Show's over. Back to your rooms.
Nothing to see here.

202
00:21:28,446 --> 00:21:30,782
What do you think
happened here?

203
00:21:30,949 --> 00:21:34,369
-What's going on?
-I don't know.

204
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:37,580
It's Malik.

205
00:21:40,834 --> 00:21:41,876
What happened?

206
00:21:42,043 --> 00:21:45,964
-He doesn't feel like talking now.
-Can I help?

207
00:21:47,674 --> 00:21:49,676
What's that all about?

208
00:21:52,762 --> 00:21:54,305
I don't know.

209
00:21:58,309 --> 00:22:01,396
Hey, man. Malik, wait up.

210
00:22:01,813 --> 00:22:05,900
What's up, man?
Why'd you move all your stuff out?

211
00:22:06,067 --> 00:22:08,403
I'm staying with some homies now.

212
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:12,365
I thought you and David
might want to live together.

213
00:22:12,532 --> 00:22:15,493
David doesn't even know
if he's going to school next semester.

214
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:20,040
He's all depressed. His parents
have him going to a shrink.

215
00:22:20,373 --> 00:22:23,960
-I think he's lost it, myself.
-Listen, Wayne.

216
00:22:24,127 --> 00:22:26,421
I think you're cool, man.

217
00:22:26,588 --> 00:22:29,591
We ain't never had no beef,
outside of your dirty clothes...

218
00:22:29,758 --> 00:22:32,177
...and opposite taste in music.

219
00:22:32,343 --> 00:22:35,805
But I'm just--
I'm at the point where...

220
00:22:35,972 --> 00:22:39,559
...l feel safer and more comfortable
with my own people.

221
00:22:39,726 --> 00:22:43,897
I ain't come here to have
no white boy pull a gun in my face.

222
00:22:44,063 --> 00:22:46,316
I could have got that in the ghetto.

223
00:22:46,524 --> 00:22:51,321
Seems like this system is setup
towards maintaining white supremacy.

224
00:22:51,529 --> 00:22:53,364
I didn't come here to learn that--

225
00:22:53,531 --> 00:22:58,995
I understand you're pissed.
But I'm not like that, Malik.

226
00:23:00,705 --> 00:23:02,665
You treat me like I'm Remy.

227
00:23:02,832 --> 00:23:05,960
I'm not like that.
I'm no white supremacist!

228
00:23:06,127 --> 00:23:07,754
Is that what you see?

229
00:23:09,297 --> 00:23:11,007
I'm different.

230
00:23:11,174 --> 00:23:14,511
So are you. You know?

231
00:23:20,475 --> 00:23:25,772
No, I'm not. Neither are you.
That's the problem.

232
00:23:26,022 --> 00:23:28,107
Peace.

233
00:23:33,613 --> 00:23:37,825
What are you two doing
sitting there? Plotting?

234
00:23:40,078 --> 00:23:44,499
Yeah, we're plotting.
Plotting to steal.

235
00:23:45,833 --> 00:23:47,544
To steal what?

236
00:23:49,462 --> 00:23:56,135
-To steal the information. All of it.
-Yeah, but whose information is it?

237
00:23:56,761 --> 00:24:01,182
The more you learn about this system,
the more upset you get.

238
00:24:03,268 --> 00:24:07,146
Oh, my dear Mr. Williams.

239
00:24:08,731 --> 00:24:10,567
Peppermint?

240
00:24:13,778 --> 00:24:16,614
Information is power.

241
00:24:18,658 --> 00:24:23,454
If you don't have the information,
one cannot seize power.

242
00:24:25,498 --> 00:24:29,502
You need to think about
becoming mentally competitive.

243
00:24:29,711 --> 00:24:33,298
Being black does not free you
from being a responsible individual.

244
00:24:33,464 --> 00:24:38,845
But being a responsible individual
don't free you from being black.

245
00:24:39,012 --> 00:24:42,348
-That's right.
-Poor, misguided soul.

246
00:24:43,016 --> 00:24:46,769
You have yet to learn
the rules of this game.

247
00:24:46,936 --> 00:24:49,814
-He will.
-I don't want to.

248
00:24:49,981 --> 00:24:53,735
See, I'm smart enough to know
it's not my game to play.

249
00:24:53,901 --> 00:24:55,528
I'm just a pawn like everybody else.

250
00:24:55,987 --> 00:25:00,408
Used intelligently, a pawn can create
a checkmate, Mr. Williams.

251
00:25:00,575 --> 00:25:04,495
Or become a very
powerful player himself.

252
00:25:04,871 --> 00:25:10,460
Don't you understand?
This is all a game. All of this.

253
00:25:10,626 --> 00:25:16,215
Like basketball, football,
Mr. Big-Time Track Star, a game.

254
00:25:16,382 --> 00:25:18,009
You play it to win.

255
00:25:18,176 --> 00:25:24,348
Because in the real world, no one wants
to hear excuses or empty rhetoric.

256
00:25:24,515 --> 00:25:27,143
They want to know
if you have a plan.

257
00:25:34,442 --> 00:25:36,277
Right.

258
00:25:37,111 --> 00:25:41,324
Mr. Williams, Mr. White,
good afternoon.

259
00:25:41,491 --> 00:25:43,534
All right.

260
00:25:45,161 --> 00:25:47,205
Mr. White?

261
00:25:48,956 --> 00:25:53,544
-You had his class before?
-Yeah, I had his class once.

262
00:25:53,711 --> 00:25:55,880
Maybe twice.

263
00:25:57,423 --> 00:25:58,674
Let's roll.

264
00:25:58,841 --> 00:26:03,679
" Mr. Williams, do you have a plan?
Nobody wants to hear that bullshit."

265
00:26:03,888 --> 00:26:07,475
Somebody's got to do something
about how tense it is.

266
00:26:07,642 --> 00:26:12,688
We can't let the campus go crazy
because of the actions of some psycho.

267
00:26:12,855 --> 00:26:16,651
What do you mean, "we"?
"We" don't have to do anything.

268
00:26:16,818 --> 00:26:21,531
Just because you and I get along
doesn't mean everybody else has to.

269
00:26:21,697 --> 00:26:25,284
Get that "We Are the World"
stuff out of your head...

270
00:26:25,451 --> 00:26:28,913
...'cause it is not gonna happen,
not on this campus.

271
00:26:42,802 --> 00:26:46,430
Hi, here's a flyer for the Peace Fest.
Take a flyer.

272
00:26:47,515 --> 00:26:48,849
Come to the Peace Fest.

273
00:27:50,494 --> 00:27:52,288
-Faggot.
-Suck my ass.

274
00:27:52,455 --> 00:27:54,707
-Fuck.
-Fuck you.

275
00:27:54,874 --> 00:27:58,419
-Fuck me? Why don't you shut up?
-Don't start that.

276
00:27:58,586 --> 00:28:01,547
Why did you drop out of school?

277
00:28:05,426 --> 00:28:08,387
I never really wanted
to go anyway, man.

278
00:28:08,554 --> 00:28:12,308
All's it was was an excuse
to get out of ldaho.

279
00:28:12,892 --> 00:28:14,643
You know?

280
00:28:15,811 --> 00:28:20,441
What's the point? The gooks and
towelheads get the engineering jobs.

281
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:26,572
Leave the white man in the cold.
Goddamn affirmative action shit. Right?

282
00:28:26,739 --> 00:28:31,202
You really should not have dropped out
of school. You hear me?

283
00:28:31,535 --> 00:28:36,373
We need more people like you
to become doctors, lawyers, engineers.

284
00:28:36,582 --> 00:28:41,629
You listen, you get it together and
you do something for your own people.

285
00:28:41,796 --> 00:28:43,089
Your own country.

286
00:28:43,255 --> 00:28:48,094
If you don't, you ain't nothing
but a race traitor yourself, you hear?

287
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,053
Fuck you, you big-eared faggot!

288
00:28:49,053 --> 00:28:50,304
Fuck you, you big-eared faggot!

289
00:28:50,471 --> 00:28:54,767
No, you know what?
You are worse than a fucking nigger!

290
00:30:03,085 --> 00:30:05,004
-What's up?
-Is Malik here?

291
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:10,175
Yeah. You didn't bring no homies?
Got any sisters?

292
00:30:11,552 --> 00:30:13,929
-What's up?
-You got crazy friends.

293
00:30:16,807 --> 00:30:18,350
What happened?

294
00:30:22,104 --> 00:30:24,648
Skinhead fool who
pulled a gun on me....

295
00:30:24,815 --> 00:30:27,234
I beat him.
I'm the man. I'm God!

296
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,737
Put something cold on it.

297
00:30:29,903 --> 00:30:33,240
-I don't need no ice.
-Put the ice on it!

298
00:30:35,826 --> 00:30:37,828
I had his ass like this:

299
00:30:42,833 --> 00:30:46,670
Why you fighting like some thug?
This is college.

300
00:30:46,837 --> 00:30:49,256
I don't know about that no more.

301
00:30:49,423 --> 00:30:52,968
About to take a semester off,
let the shit cool.

302
00:30:54,219 --> 00:30:59,433
It's about this, nigger! See this?
Yo, it's about this black fist, nigger!

303
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,853
We gonna pound
their motherfucking ass...

304
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:06,398
...until they give in, motherfucker!

305
00:31:06,565 --> 00:31:08,567
You're gonna drop out.

306
00:31:08,734 --> 00:31:11,779
-Did I say that?
-I see it in your eyes.

307
00:31:11,945 --> 00:31:15,157
I said I'm gonna take me a break.
Look at me!

308
00:31:15,324 --> 00:31:21,163
-Look what they did to my fucking face!
-What's wrong with you?

309
00:31:28,045 --> 00:31:33,258
It's a war, man.
This is the first battle in the war.

310
00:31:33,425 --> 00:31:38,806
I'm telling you, man. Remy's right,
man. It's their gang against our gang.

311
00:31:39,765 --> 00:31:42,935
Fucking Malik.
I'm gonna get him. Fuck him!

312
00:31:43,102 --> 00:31:47,356
Fuck all those fucking niggers.
They're all gonna fucking die.

313
00:31:47,523 --> 00:31:52,694
Fucking Malik's a piece of shit.
It's all right. We're coming back, man.

314
00:31:54,154 --> 00:31:58,867
We're coming back. Niggers, spics,
the fucking mud people, they'll get it.

315
00:31:59,034 --> 00:32:02,162
-Fucking idiots.
-Fuck all those niggers, man!

316
00:32:05,374 --> 00:32:08,460
Hey, yo, trooper.
What's up, man?

317
00:32:08,669 --> 00:32:13,090
What's up with your girl?
She out there looking kinda bugged.

318
00:32:13,257 --> 00:32:17,219
It ain't nothing.
She's just tripping, I guess.

319
00:32:19,012 --> 00:32:21,056
It's all good, though.

320
00:32:23,016 --> 00:32:26,270
Them fools.
They so lucky they called security.

321
00:32:26,436 --> 00:32:31,066
I was fit to kill one of them white
boys. You know what I'm saying?

322
00:32:31,233 --> 00:32:35,195
Whoa, shit!
Fucking white boy.

323
00:32:35,362 --> 00:32:40,367
See how he swole my shit up?
Knuckles all fat and shit.

324
00:32:40,534 --> 00:32:43,912
It's all right, though.
Whipped his ass so bad...

325
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:48,000
...his stepmom's gonna feel me
for the next three birthdays.

326
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:50,919
Look what his homeboy did
to your head.

327
00:32:51,128 --> 00:32:55,883
What you talking about? This shit?
He ain't fading nothing over here.

328
00:32:56,049 --> 00:33:00,012
-One ass-whooping, but they still won.
-How you figure that?

329
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,224
Look around you, man.

330
00:33:04,641 --> 00:33:06,643
They own this shit.

331
00:33:07,603 --> 00:33:12,274
They own this couch you sitting on,
them shoes on your feet...

332
00:33:12,441 --> 00:33:16,320
...this building, this school,
this country, you!

333
00:33:18,614 --> 00:33:21,241
We're behind enemy lines, dog.

334
00:33:22,242 --> 00:33:28,248
One beat-down will never compare
to 439 years of captivity. Never.

335
00:33:29,374 --> 00:33:32,711
You don't know shit, freshman.

336
00:33:36,298 --> 00:33:39,885
This is a war. This is the opening
stages of World War lll.

337
00:33:40,052 --> 00:33:42,346
I said, shut the fuck up!

338
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:50,312
I'm tired of hearing your bullshit. I'm
tired of you trying to rev everybody up.

339
00:33:50,479 --> 00:33:55,192
What are you gonna do, college boy?
And you don't even got your GED.

340
00:33:55,359 --> 00:33:59,029
-Two fucking dumb-asses together.
-I'm gonna make war.

341
00:33:59,404 --> 00:34:01,698
That's right, man. A race war.

342
00:34:01,907 --> 00:34:04,201
-On who?
-On the fucking niggers.

343
00:34:04,368 --> 00:34:08,205
On the fucking race traitors.
On the fucking everybody.

344
00:34:08,747 --> 00:34:10,248
Why you testing me?

345
00:34:11,792 --> 00:34:15,003
Remy, you ever shot somebody before?

346
00:34:17,047 --> 00:34:21,510
Actually, better yet,
you ever shoot a piece of meat?

347
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:25,305
Seen what bullets do to flesh?

348
00:34:27,182 --> 00:34:31,603
Them fucking niggers out there,
them fucking little monkeys...

349
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:34,147
...those gangbangers...

350
00:34:34,981 --> 00:34:40,612
...are training every fucking day
and every night shooting each other.

351
00:34:46,576 --> 00:34:48,954
They're ready for war.

352
00:34:49,162 --> 00:34:51,415
But are you?

353
00:34:52,916 --> 00:34:55,252
If it all went down today...

354
00:34:56,837 --> 00:35:00,424
...which one of you would have
the balls to shoot a nigger?

355
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:02,426
-I would.
-You would?

356
00:35:03,385 --> 00:35:05,095
Would you?

357
00:35:06,805 --> 00:35:08,849
I have.

358
00:35:11,101 --> 00:35:13,520
-I'd do it.
-Yeah?

359
00:35:13,728 --> 00:35:16,064
That's right. I'd do it.

360
00:35:16,731 --> 00:35:18,567
All right, then.

361
00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:22,946
-What's his problem?
-My fucking head's killing me.

362
00:35:23,113 --> 00:35:25,740
Everybody says things one way,
and you talk to me that way?

363
00:35:25,907 --> 00:35:29,369
This is my blood, man.
It's white blood.

364
00:35:30,287 --> 00:35:32,998
What you got there, Scott?

365
00:35:44,885 --> 00:35:49,514
Go on and kill one of them, man.
Big shot.

366
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:53,268
-Are you really gonna do it?
-Yeah, he's gonna!

367
00:35:53,435 --> 00:35:55,145
I'll do it.

368
00:35:55,687 --> 00:35:58,648
You do it.
You do this shit, Remy!

369
00:35:59,357 --> 00:36:02,319
Right between the nigger's
fucking eyes!

370
00:36:02,485 --> 00:36:05,238
-I'll do it, man.
-All right, Remy!

371
00:36:05,405 --> 00:36:08,283
Come here. Hey! Hey!

372
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:15,290
There are many ways to fight a battle.
Different fronts for different people.

373
00:36:15,457 --> 00:36:18,335
Some people use their mind,
some use words...

374
00:36:18,501 --> 00:36:20,837
-...some use fists.
-This is my front.

375
00:36:21,046 --> 00:36:24,007
-For real?
-That's right. This is my front.

376
00:36:24,174 --> 00:36:27,135
-You're full of shit.
-I'm for real.

377
00:36:30,972 --> 00:36:32,557
Go ahead, then.

378
00:36:34,517 --> 00:36:36,311
What is high?

379
00:36:36,853 --> 00:36:38,855
What is higher?

380
00:36:39,147 --> 00:36:41,483
What is learn?

381
00:36:41,691 --> 00:36:43,443
What is learning?

382
00:36:43,652 --> 00:36:46,821
What is higher learning?

383
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:50,033
What it is?
I mean, what is it?

384
00:36:50,325 --> 00:36:53,119
What is higher learning?

385
00:36:55,955 --> 00:36:58,583
Promise me you won't drop out.

386
00:37:00,001 --> 00:37:02,879
I ain't going nowhere without you.

387
00:37:08,051 --> 00:37:10,512
<i>Viking Two to Viking One.</i>

388
00:37:12,097 --> 00:37:14,474
-Yeah, Viking One.
-Let's do it, man.

389
00:37:14,683 --> 00:37:19,312
I'm gonna kill communication.
This looks suspicious. All right?

390
00:37:23,066 --> 00:37:25,318
For Eurocentric indoctrination...

391
00:37:25,485 --> 00:37:28,863
...is learning in an environment
that is mostly white.

392
00:37:29,823 --> 00:37:33,827
<i>If the Dred Scott decision
was retried in a contemporary court...</i>

393
00:37:33,993 --> 00:37:36,329
<i>... the decision would be the same...</i>

394
00:37:36,496 --> 00:37:39,833
<i>...meaning that a black man
would still have no rights...</i>

395
00:37:39,999 --> 00:37:42,836
<i>... that a white man, by law,
would be bound to respect.</i>

396
00:37:43,002 --> 00:37:45,672
<i>The result would be the same
no matter what the law states...</i>

397
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:49,217
<i>...because it was not written by and
for the benefit of African-Americans.</i>

398
00:37:49,384 --> 00:37:51,469
<i>The credo
"And liberty and justice for all"...</i>

399
00:37:51,636 --> 00:37:56,683
<i>... is a falsehood that has been widely
ignored and needs to be addressed.</i>

400
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:20,975
That was great.

401
00:39:21,142 --> 00:39:24,687
Let's give a big round of applause
for Eve's Plum.

402
00:39:38,826 --> 00:39:42,372
The purpose of this gathering
is to bring together everyone...

403
00:39:42,538 --> 00:39:46,209
...so we can have fun
despite our differences...

404
00:39:46,376 --> 00:39:50,213
...whether they be racial,
cultural or sexual.

405
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:54,676
This is a celebration of the
commonality of these differences.

406
00:39:54,842 --> 00:39:58,513
There are people in this country who
have profited from keeping us apart.

407
00:40:19,659 --> 00:40:21,828
Do you feel better?

408
00:40:21,994 --> 00:40:23,830
I'll feel better tonight.

409
00:40:24,664 --> 00:40:26,249
Shoot, Remy, shoot!

410
00:40:28,376 --> 00:40:30,962
<i>Remy, brother,
you gotta do it now!</i>

411
00:40:31,129 --> 00:40:33,965
<i>Come on, Remy!
Do it for the Aryan Nation!</i>

412
00:40:34,132 --> 00:40:37,260
<i>White power, Remy!
White power!</i>

413
00:40:37,552 --> 00:40:39,345
<i>White power!</i>

414
00:40:54,652 --> 00:40:58,990
-I know what that was. Come on.
-It was probably a car.

415
00:41:01,617 --> 00:41:03,035
Shit!

416
00:41:03,202 --> 00:41:05,580
Somebody's got a gun!

417
00:41:05,746 --> 00:41:09,250
Everybody, stay calm.
Don't panic.

418
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:35,818
Come on!

419
00:42:48,182 --> 00:42:51,394
Why?!

420
00:43:04,907 --> 00:43:07,576
We have to get her to the hospital.

421
00:43:10,705 --> 00:43:12,581
Go get some help, boy!

422
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:16,085
Mr. Williams?

423
00:43:16,627 --> 00:43:19,046
Mr. Williams, please....

424
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:25,344
Malik, what are you
standing there for?

425
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:28,431
You must go now!

426
00:43:28,723 --> 00:43:31,350
Do you hear me, Mr. Williams?

427
00:43:31,851 --> 00:43:33,853
Do you hear me?

428
00:44:38,083 --> 00:44:40,169
White motherfucker!

429
00:44:40,377 --> 00:44:41,420
You're dead!

430
00:45:00,481 --> 00:45:03,317
It's my world. It's my country.

431
00:45:03,567 --> 00:45:05,402
It's my world.

432
00:45:05,611 --> 00:45:08,364
You're nothing but a monkey.
Look at me.

433
00:45:08,614 --> 00:45:11,116
I'm a man. I'm the man.

434
00:45:11,325 --> 00:45:13,953
I'm a man! You're nothing!

435
00:45:14,161 --> 00:45:17,831
-You're nothing! You can't beat me.
-Fuck you.

436
00:45:24,046 --> 00:45:26,048
I fucking hate you!

437
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:28,133
You gonna die!

438
00:45:28,342 --> 00:45:29,843
She's dead!

439
00:45:30,052 --> 00:45:32,096
I'm gonna kill you!

440
00:45:34,056 --> 00:45:36,475
You're gonna die now!

441
00:45:41,021 --> 00:45:43,357
-You all right?
-Get off me!

442
00:46:06,088 --> 00:46:08,507
Hey, kid. What are you doing, kid?

443
00:46:08,757 --> 00:46:10,592
Take it easy. Come on.

444
00:46:13,554 --> 00:46:16,640
It's gonna be all right. Settle down.

445
00:46:19,101 --> 00:46:23,522
Everything's gonna be fine.
Take it easy. Just relax.

446
00:46:24,648 --> 00:46:26,567
What are you doing? No!

447
00:46:27,776 --> 00:46:29,903
-Don't shoot.
-Get away!

448
00:46:30,154 --> 00:46:32,281
-We can't get back, kid, we can't.
-You wanna shoot me.

449
00:46:32,531 --> 00:46:34,783
No, we don't. Put the gun down.

450
00:46:34,992 --> 00:46:38,328
-Get away from me.
-We're not coming any closer.

451
00:46:38,537 --> 00:46:41,457
-You're lying.
-I'm not. Nobody's hurt yet.

452
00:46:41,665 --> 00:46:45,502
-You're lying.
-I'm not lying. Look at my eyes.

453
00:46:45,753 --> 00:46:47,379
Phoney.

454
00:46:49,965 --> 00:46:51,759
I'm sorry.

455
00:46:52,843 --> 00:46:54,636
I'm sorry.

456
00:46:57,139 --> 00:47:00,309
It's okay. We know. Put it down.

457
00:47:00,559 --> 00:47:02,644
-It's over.
-No.

458
00:47:02,895 --> 00:47:05,105
Don't do this. Put it down.

459
00:47:05,314 --> 00:47:08,817
I wanted to build things.
I wanted to be an engineer.

460
00:47:09,026 --> 00:47:11,612
-You still can.
-Stop lying!

461
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:15,157
Please, put the gun down. It's okay.

462
00:47:15,365 --> 00:47:16,825
It hurts.

463
00:47:17,075 --> 00:47:18,660
I know.

464
00:47:19,077 --> 00:47:22,498
-It hurts.
-I know, kid. It's okay.

465
00:47:22,873 --> 00:47:24,625
-It's okay.
-It's not.

466
00:47:24,875 --> 00:47:26,376
It is.

467
00:49:27,497 --> 00:49:32,002
This is Columbus University,
a great centre of higher learning.

468
00:49:32,210 --> 00:49:34,629
But the lesson taught here today...

469
00:49:34,838 --> 00:49:38,216
...was one in how good things
can go tragically wrong.

470
00:49:38,467 --> 00:49:43,597
A multicultural peace fest organized
in the interest of campus unity...

471
00:49:43,805 --> 00:49:46,224
...has ended with three people dead.

472
00:49:46,433 --> 00:49:52,147
One of them was a gunman who took his
own life after killing two students.

473
00:49:52,355 --> 00:49:53,398
The mayor...

474
00:49:53,607 --> 00:49:56,651
<i>... is on his way to the campus
as we speak.</i>

475
00:49:56,902 --> 00:50:01,239
<i>University administration
has had nothing whatsoever to say.</i>

476
00:50:01,448 --> 00:50:03,700
Wow. You know what that is?

477
00:50:04,034 --> 00:50:06,203
Remy's fucking dead.

478
00:50:07,412 --> 00:50:10,916
No, man. That's white power.

479
00:50:12,667 --> 00:50:14,669
Yeah, you're right.

480
00:50:15,504 --> 00:50:19,466
White power. White fucking power!

481
00:50:20,175 --> 00:50:23,220
<i>-White power!
-Sieg heil.</i>

482
00:50:55,836 --> 00:50:58,255
What do you think I should do?

483
00:51:02,717 --> 00:51:04,928
What do I think?

484
00:51:08,765 --> 00:51:10,350
You're right.

485
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:12,644
That's my job.

486
00:51:13,562 --> 00:51:15,146
Man....

487
00:51:15,981 --> 00:51:18,525
Man, I don't know, you know?

488
00:51:18,775 --> 00:51:20,986
Maybe if I hadn't....

489
00:51:21,194 --> 00:51:22,862
It's just....

490
00:51:23,655 --> 00:51:26,408
Man, I don't know what to do.

491
00:51:30,996 --> 00:51:33,331
Mr. Williams...

492
00:51:33,582 --> 00:51:38,920
...in spite of the recent tragedy here,
you have persevered.

493
00:51:39,504 --> 00:51:42,882
You have overcome many obstacles
this semester.

494
00:51:43,091 --> 00:51:48,096
For those reasons,
you have my utmost respect...

495
00:51:48,305 --> 00:51:50,807
...and every confidence...

496
00:51:51,057 --> 00:51:55,729
...that you will make a wise decision
concerning your future.

497
00:52:12,912 --> 00:52:14,789
Got to think.

498
00:52:16,750 --> 00:52:19,377
Got to get my head straight.

499
00:52:21,254 --> 00:52:23,340
I'm gonna go now.

500
00:52:45,737 --> 00:52:48,782
Without struggle,
there is no progress.

501
00:52:51,743 --> 00:52:53,620
Frederick Douglass.

502
00:53:09,094 --> 00:53:10,887
Right.

503
00:53:57,183 --> 00:53:59,477
I lost my girl here.

504
00:54:09,904 --> 00:54:13,366
I feel like this is all my fault.

505
00:54:14,033 --> 00:54:17,620
I helped put this whole thing together.

506
00:54:19,330 --> 00:54:21,624
I'm responsible for all of this.

507
00:54:29,132 --> 00:54:31,175
Oh, God.

508
00:54:39,559 --> 00:54:40,977
Hey.

509
00:54:46,566 --> 00:54:49,152
You can't blame yourself, you know?

510
00:54:58,745 --> 00:55:01,205
My name's Kristen.

511
00:55:02,415 --> 00:55:04,334
Malik.

512
00:55:06,711 --> 00:55:08,921
Nice to meet you.

513
00:55:11,215 --> 00:55:13,509
I seen you around.

514
00:55:17,972 --> 00:55:20,183
Phipps' class, huh?

515
00:55:22,143 --> 00:55:24,729
It's funny we never spoke before.

516
00:55:31,110 --> 00:55:32,695
Yeah.

517
00:55:32,904 --> 00:55:34,572
It's funny.

518
00:55:52,131 --> 00:55:53,758
Well...

519
00:55:54,342 --> 00:55:56,260
...I gotta get going.

520
00:56:00,306 --> 00:56:02,975
-Take care.
-You too.

521
00:56:48,604 --> 00:56:51,315
All right. Give us a big smile now.

522
00:56:52,315 --> 00:57:02,315
