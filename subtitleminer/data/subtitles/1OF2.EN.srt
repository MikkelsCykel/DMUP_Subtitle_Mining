1
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,960
Julian.
You came all the way out here?

2
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,920
I had to leave somebody at the beach.

3
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,960
- It's been weeks.
- Hi.

4
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,480
Hello, girls.

5
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,240
You didn't fly to Rio
for the weekend?

6
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:39,360
Don't mind them.
They're just jealous.

7
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,320
I've been trying
to reach you all day.

8
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,880
Yeah, I got the message. Number?

9
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,720
Tonight. It's a woman
from Charlottesville.

10
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,120
She's flying in for negotiation
on her husband's estate.

11
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,240
- First time?
- Yeah.

12
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:59,360
She's meeting lawyers in the morning.
They want a chauffeur.

13
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,560
- Is she into drugs?
- No, no drugs.

14
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,960
1,000, right?

15
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,680
600 for me.

16
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,560
- Don't start this again.
- You want 50/50, get Mike,

17
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:19,080
or one of those drop-outs
you like so much.

18
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,480
There's no percentage in it
if I don't get 50/50.

19
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,040
You already cut me out of repeaters.

20
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,520
It's only fair. Only fair.

21
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,280
It ain't fair, Julie,
but I don't have any choice.

22
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,160
You got a lot of choice. You can
keep dealing retarded faggots...

23
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,200
Look who 's talking!

24
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,520
All right... 50/50.

25
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,000
Who ' d you drop off up the beach?

26
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,680
- Wouldn't you like to know.
- Why do you do this to me?

27
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:58,240
You know anybody else
who gets in the LA Country Club?

28
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,120
And that's not the Hillcrest
or the Riverside or the Riviera.

29
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,160
I gotta run.
Leave the info on the service.

30
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,880
You don't want to take some sun?

31
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,040
I'm sure the girls
would like some company.

32
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,760
No, thanks. No way. See you later.

33
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,800
How's the Swedish coming?

34
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,400
OK.

35
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,360
Do you want me to help you?

36
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,840
Listen to the recording
and repeat what you hear.

37
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,520
Listen and then repeat.

38
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,360
I am not interested in that.

39
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,280
I am not interested in that.

40
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,440
How much farther have we to go?

41
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,440
How much farther have we to go?

42
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,520
Is this your first visit?

43
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,640
Yeah?

44
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,840
OK, let him through.

45
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,880
Hey, Leon, what's up?

46
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,520
Julie, I hate to bug you,
but you gotta help me.

47
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,840
I had this Palm Springs gig
set up for Joey

48
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,680
and he ain't nowhere around.

49
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:17,760
I can't do it. I'm getting a haircut
I got something on this afternoon.

50
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,880
Baby, this is a two-hour gig.

51
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,760
Plus the drive.

52
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,120
5C, straight in-and-out job.
Nothing fancy. Do me a favour.

53
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,680
I don't know. Maybe.
If I get some time.

54
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,520
I'll give you 50 bucks.

55
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,440
Go fuck yourself.
You think I'm a charity?

56
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,360
Wait a minute.
Who 's doing who a favour?

57
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,120
Who called who up, begging for a sub?

58
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,560
OK. I'm sorry. I appreciate it.

59
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,600
Anything for a friend.

60
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,000
Ex cuse me.

61
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,680
Mind if I take my cap off, ma'am?

62
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,520
No, of course not.

63
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,720
Thank you.

64
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:23,000
I think I know this hotel
better than my own apartment.

65
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:27,160
All the important people
come and stay here.

66
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,680
You know,
I used to be a pool boy here.

67
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,080
Anything I can do to help you?

68
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,280
I'll open the champagne for you.

69
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,320
- Open up the...?
- Julian. My name is Julian.

70
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,760
You don't have to open the champagne.

71
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,560
I will give you a tip, don't worry.

72
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,840
Jesus.

73
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:53,320
I'm sorry, Mrs Tolbin.
That's not what I meant. I was...

74
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,920
I'm sorry.

75
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,920
Is this your first time in LA?

76
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,600
- Maybe you can be a help to me.
- Yeah?

77
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,240
Well, I haven't been here for years,

78
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,960
and I was wondering if there are
any new good restaurants.

79
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,000
You know, where the famous people go?

80
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,520
Yeah, well...

81
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,400
it's probably safer to recommend
the more established restaurants.

82
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:31,640
There's...Ma Maison and La Scala...

83
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,600
Scandia.

84
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:39,920
And of the newer ones,
I hear that Le Dome is quite nice.

85
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,560
Very popular.

86
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:48,720
My, you are making me
thirsty just standing there.

87
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,360
Now you can open the champagne.

88
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,960
Pour me a drink...

89
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,000
and set the bottle down.

90
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,440
Yeah, she liked the pool boy bit.

91
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,680
I'm going to see her
again tomorrow afternoon.

92
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,320
Yeah.

93
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,360
OK, Anne. Love you, too.

94
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,000
Paging Mrs Anderson.

95
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,240
Hey, pretty lady.

96
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,560
- Hi.
- Got my other jacket?

97
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,480
- Sure. Here you go, Julian.
- Thanks.

98
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,880
- Good evening, Mr Kay.
- How you doing?

99
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,520
Fine.

100
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,840
Then he has the nerve
to hit on my sister.

101
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,880
No, he's not.

102
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,600
I told you. He's looking right at us.

103
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,280
What'll it be?

104
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,800
No, that's OK, Jimmy.

105
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,800
Mr Kay would like another drink.

106
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,320
- Dry Manhattan on the rocks.
- Yes, sir.

107
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,600
- You speak English.
- You speak English.

108
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,000
- You fooled me.
- And you me.

109
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,640
How long have you
been in Los Angeles?

110
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,640
I live here.

111
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,960
You live here? I don't understand.

112
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:26,120
You wouldn't. I'm just trying
to refresh my college French.

113
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:31,560
I usually practise with a friend,
but she's not here yet.

114
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,960
Where are you from?

115
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,440
I was born in Torino,

116
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,920
but I studied at Nantes.

117
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,080
You hardly have any accent at all.

118
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,920
Yeah, I've been travelling too much.

119
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,760
I envy you. I love to travel.

120
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:05,640
I used to travel a lot, but my
husband's involved in local politics.

121
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,080
So now I just practise French.

122
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,760
He thinks it's chic
to have a bilingual wife.

123
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,200
I think he's right.

124
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,000
Where are you going?

125
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,040
I made a mistake.

126
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,280
My husband's in New York.

127
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,480
What about your friend?

128
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,200
I'm not waiting for anyone.

129
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,520
- You still don't understand.
- Understand what?

130
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,560
Who I am.

131
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,880
Who are you?

132
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,480
You don't even understand
who you are, why you're sitting here.

133
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,440
Why are you here?

134
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:04,760
- I've got to go.
- All right. Just one thing.

135
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,160
Why did you come on to me?

136
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,160
Like I said, I made a mistake.

137
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,600
I heard you speaking French.

138
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:18,200
Often in these big hotels, you run
into women from foreign countries

139
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:22,240
who may need
a translator...or a guide.

140
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,680
And they hire you?

141
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,640
Yes.

142
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,360
How many languages do you speak?

143
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,400
Five or six.

144
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:46,840
Plus the...international language.

145
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,360
That's right.

146
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,280
Well, now,

147
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,720
you're something really
special, aren't you?

148
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,320
You're one to talk.

149
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:14,400
I saw you sitting here. You wanted me
to come over. I came over.

150
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,160
I know what I see.

151
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,040
How much would you have charged me?

152
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,520
As what? Translator or guide?

153
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,480
No. Just one fuck.

154
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,080
Now you've made a mistake.
I don't do that.

155
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:34,280
You don't, huh?

156
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:38,320
I know what I see, too, Monsieur Kay.

157
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,840
It's been a pleasure talking to you,
Madame Joste.

158
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,080
Look, someone's made a mistake here.
I don't do fags.

159
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,160
- I didn't mean that.
- Or couples.

160
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,040
No, no, no. You don't understand.

161
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,120
It's just my wife Judy. Not me.

162
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,040
Just her.

163
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,880
- But I can watch.
- Of course.

164
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,600
Would you like a drink?

165
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,080
Not yet.

166
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,800
- I think I' d like my money now.
- Sure. Sure.

167
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,560
- I like to talk after.
- Sure.

168
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,200
Hello, Judy.

169
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:59,000
You're a very sexy lady,
a very good-looking woman.

170
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,200
A very pretty woman. You'll like me.

171
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,200
I can tell...

172
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,280
because I like you. I like you.

173
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,200
So just relax and close your eyes.

174
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,080
Just relax
and let your mind run free.

175
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,800
Don't worry about anything.

176
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:29,320
I can take care of you.
I know what you want.

177
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,480
That's right. Close your eyes.

178
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:43,040
Forget about him.
This is just you and me.

179
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,160
No, no, no, from behind.

180
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,880
It has to be from behind.

181
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:56,200
Ok, baby, just flip over
on your stomach.

182
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,480
Just relax. Don't worry.
Leave everything to me,

183
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:04,120
' cause I'm going to take care of you.

184
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,280
I'm going to get you wet, very wet.

185
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,120
I know how to do this.

186
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,640
Now slap her.

187
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,120
Slap that cunt.

188
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:35,600
- Hey, Leon.
- How you doing, Jule?

189
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,520
I want to thank you
for helping me out, Julie.

190
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:48,720
Finally found Joey holed up
with one of his...boyfriends,

191
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:52,760
just banging away,
you know how it is. Dumb bastard.

192
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:56,400
- Hello, Julian.
- Hi. I'll just have a Perrier.

193
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:04,400
You made quite a hit in Palm Springs.
They want you back.

194
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,160
I'm serious.
They want you back this week.

195
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,280
I wouldn't take much,
you know. It's...

196
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,800
They're regulars for me.

197
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,760
You lied, Leon.
It was a rough trick.

198
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,560
I forgot. You got scruples now, huh?

199
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,720
I don't like playing
the same numbers too often.

200
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,240
They get possessive.

201
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,720
- I can't be possessed.
- Does that include Miss Anne?

202
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,560
Anne who?

203
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:41,640
I don't know why you fool around
with that dumb bitch.

204
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:46,960
I'll tell you why, Leon. She's got
a job coming up for me in a week.

205
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,840
Eight grand.

206
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,520
Can you get me that?

207
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,040
All right. All right.

208
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,240
Thanks, hon.

209
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:02,280
Just trying to warn you, that's all.
That bitch will sell you out.

210
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:06,480
But you really care about me,
don't you? Don't you, Leon?

211
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,520
You care.

212
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,640
You know, you walk
an awful thin line, Julian.

213
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,280
I wouldn't want to be in your shoes.
You're getting cocky.

214
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:20,680
The other boys are happy,
with a car, a house, but not you.

215
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:25,960
You got all your rich pussy lined up,
once-a-month tricks,

216
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:30,760
a dip in the pool,
a little tennis, and orgasm.

217
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,440
I'm just to warning you as a friend.

218
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,720
If those bitches ever turn on you,
you're through.

219
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,440
You're sure about that?

220
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,760
They'll cut you out.

221
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,400
Yeah?

222
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,080
Says she's a friend?

223
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,160
Where does she know me from?

224
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,560
Yeah, send her up.

225
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,440
I'm Michelle.

226
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:33,120
- How did you find me?
- It wasn't hard.

227
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,160
Are you surprised?

228
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,280
What do you want?

229
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:54,240
I would have thought that you' d live
in a place with thick red carpet,

230
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,640
- big bed, mirrors on the ceiling...
- Bordello.

231
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:03,160
This is my apartment.
Women don't come here.

232
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,200
- You're going out?
- Yeah.

233
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,240
Business?

234
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:20,160
- Maybe.
- Isn't it a little late?

235
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,440
- Isn't it late for you?
- My husband's still in New York.

236
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,080
I'm alone.

237
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,200
I thought it would be easier.

238
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,040
What did you say?

239
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,800
I said I thought it would be easier.

240
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,440
What?

241
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,960
To be with you, to procure you.

242
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,200
I told you, you're mistaken.

243
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,800
Why are you doing this to me?

244
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:27,040
- What am I doing?
- Embarrassing me.

245
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,240
I'm not embarrassing you.

246
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,280
I can't keep up...

247
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,400
this front much longer.

248
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,520
I came here.

249
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,400
I found out who you were,
where you lived.

250
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,880
I came here
in the middle of the night.

251
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:01,200
I wanted to know what...
it would be like...to fuck you.

252
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,280
I brought money.

253
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:12,400
What more can I do? I...

254
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,840
I...

255
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,960
I like...

256
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,360
I don't want to know.

257
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,960
Don't say that.

258
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,440
You got me aroused
just thinking about it.

259
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:06,480
I'm lying here with a hard-on,
it's not even 10:00 yet.

260
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:11,320
Don't tease me.
Come on, baby, you're teasing me.

261
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:16,200
I'm gonna have to hang up
and jerk off right now. I am.

262
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:23,080
Yeah, I'm touching myself.
You like that, don't you?

263
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,400
Oh, come on, baby. Don't say that.

264
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,680
We're talking about having more
pleasure than you've had in years,

265
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:40,080
you got to bring up
some stupid little $1,200 stereo?

266
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,200
How much does your husband make?
What's he worth?

267
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,680
A couple of million?

268
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:52,520
Of course I could do without it.
I can listen to the radio.

269
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,560
The speaker's cracked.

270
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,320
Lisa. Lisa, listen to yourself.
You know what you're saying?

271
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,960
Can you hold on a second?
Somebody's at the door.

272
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,880
Good morning.

273
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:14,600
What do you want for breakfast?
Coffee, juice, croissant, eggs?

274
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,600
Julian Kay.

275
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,800
I want two coffee,
orange juice, croissant...

276
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,080
No eggs.

277
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:24,200
..one scrambled egg
and a side of cottage cheese.

278
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:29,560
Lisa, I'm here with a hard-on,
people all over, I can't talk.

279
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,720
I'll see you about 5:00. Bye-bye.

280
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,720
So, what do you think?

281
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,880
About what?

282
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:48,760
Did you make the right decision
to come here last night?

283
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:52,360
Was it what you expected?

284
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:55,480
No. It was like really making love.

285
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,240
I'm not used...

286
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,120
It's not what I expected.

287
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:07,480
Do you remember
what you said last night?

288
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,880
Yes.

289
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:17,480
Now, if I bid, I have to buy it.

290
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,800
Right.

291
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,240
The one I want is over here.
There it is.

292
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,760
What does it say?

293
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:30,560
" Jacobean, late 17th century".
Estimated at 4,800 to 5,200.

294
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:33,880
This has been worked on.
There's glue in it.

295
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,480
Yeah.

296
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:41,320
I don't know. My guess is this
is gonna go for 5,000. 55 maybe.

297
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:45,800
It's a great piece,
but it's not a great bargain.

298
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:48,760
At 48, that's a bargain.
What do you think?

299
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:55,440
It's perfect for the guest room,
but I...don't know.

300
00:31:55,520 --> 00:32:01,040
I saw a George III chest around here
somewhere, going for, like, 22, 23.

301
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,760
It's a lot, but a good investment.
Beautiful lines on it.

302
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:09,200
Probably the best bargain is that
tacky garnisher set over there...

303
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:12,600
- What is it?
- Do you see who I see?

304
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:15,560
- Who is it?
- It's Randolph Sloan's widow.

305
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:18,560
- A stockholder in Jim's company.
- She's still alive?

306
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,960
She's gonna make a beeline for us.

307
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,960
There goes the garnisher set.

308
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:26,360
- What am I gonna do?
- I don't know.

309
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:31,440
Come, Lisa, we must face the enemy
before they face us.

310
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,680
Lucille!

311
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:37,920
How lovely to see you.
Are you buying or selling?

312
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,560
- Just looking.
- Oh, how nice!

313
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,600
There is an ex quisite
garnisher set over there!

314
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,000
Lucille,
this is Wilhelm Schoenfeld.

315
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,160
He's helping me redecorate
the guest house.

316
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,320
Great hospitality, madame.

317
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:53,360
Oh, the dress! Look, the dress.

318
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,320
Beautiful dress. It goes
with her face. They're both beige.

319
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,360
Wilhelm.

320
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,080
Madame!

321
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:06,280
- What is going on here?
- I don't know. So sorry.

322
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,120
Lisa, we must go.

323
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,720
Did you see her face?

324
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,760
Come on.

325
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,840
I wish your husband would come back.

326
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,960
- He has.
- Good.

327
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:24,160
I can't stop thinking about you.

328
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,800
Do you mind?

329
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,240
What have you been doing?

330
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:39,440
- When?
- This morning.

331
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,840
Driving around.

332
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:46,640
I drove to Anaheim,
then I drove to Long Beach.

333
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,320
I pumped my own gas in Long Beach.

334
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,640
Then I drove here.

335
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,040
You know, Michelle,

336
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:59,080
I'm really not part of your problems.

337
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,920
I'm certainly not the solution
to your problems.

338
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,760
I brought money.

339
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,160
Don't...

340
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,240
I don't want your money.

341
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,920
I'll buy you something, then.

342
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,640
- I'll buy you that stereo.
- I got a stereo.

343
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,160
What, then?

344
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,120
Come on.

345
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,880
- What?
- We're going to my room.

346
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,920
- You want it?
- No.

347
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,960
Good, ' cause you're
not gonna get it.

348
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,760
Tell me everything about you.
Right now.

349
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:13,600
God. Why?

350
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:16,760
I don't know. It seems important.

351
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:19,240
We just made love, didn't we?

352
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,120
Yes.

353
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:24,120
Then you know everything
there is to know.

354
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,120
That's silly. Where are you from?

355
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,760
I don't know. I'm not from anywhere.

356
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,240
I'm from this bed.

357
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:39,520
Anything worth knowing, you can learn
by letting me make love to you.

358
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,840
That's not true.

359
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,440
Why do you sleep with older women?

360
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,560
I prefer older women.

361
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:54,160
Why?

362
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:58,000
What's the use of bringing
some high-schooler to climax?

363
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:02,280
Some silly teenager gets wet in the
movies and goes home to masturbate.

364
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,760
No challenge.

365
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,800
It has no meaning.

366
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,560
The other night...

367
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,600
That night I met you
at the hotel...

368
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,800
I was with a woman...

369
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,640
Somebody's mother.

370
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:27,800
Her husband didn't care
about her any more.

371
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,440
She hadn't had an orgasm in 10 years.

372
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,280
Took me 3 hours to get her off.

373
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:38,640
For a while,
I didn't think I could do it.

374
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:45,400
When it was over, I felt
like I' d done something worthwhile.

375
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:53,560
Who else would've taken the time
or cared enough to do it right?

376
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,760
My God.

377
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:03,080
These are not the handcuffs your wife
was wearing when she was killed.

378
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:05,800
Those we found in the study.

379
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,000
They were in a filing cabinet...

380
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:14,120
along with some dildos, paddles...
You know what I'm talking about.

381
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:19,640
Your private sex life is
of no concern to me or to the LAPD.

382
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,800
However, the manner
in which your wife was assaulted

383
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:29,480
suggests the killer may have
been a guest in your home once.

384
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:34,000
I'll try to keep what you tell me
in the strictest confidence.

385
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:38,840
However, I'll have to have
detailed information

386
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:42,480
about you and your
wife's sex practices...

387
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:47,000
and the names of any parties
that were involved. All right?

388
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:02,520
Sorry. Here you go. This, too.

389
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,040
I get the Salvation Army.

390
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,120
Mrs Stewart.

391
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:14,280
Hi. Ex cuse me.
Does Mr Julian Kay live here?

392
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:17,120
I'm Detective Sunday.

393
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:20,640
I'm with the homicide bureau.
I' d like to ask him a few questions.

394
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,600
What do you want?

395
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,880
You're Mr Kay?

396
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:29,320
Hello, I'm Detective Sunday.
How are you?

397
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,640
Come on.

398
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,120
I'm walking into Westwood.
You want to talk there?

399
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:37,160
- Sure.
- I'll pick that stuff up later.

400
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:47,000
I'm investigating the Rheiman murder
from the Los Angeles area.

401
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,040
You heard about the case?

402
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:52,440
- Yeah. It was in the paper, right?
- Yeah.

403
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,000
- Palm Springs.
- Right again.

404
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:59,040
- Yeah, I read about that.
- I bet.

405
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,960
- Cup of coffee?
- Sure!

406
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,120
We'll sit in the back.

407
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:09,160
Now, what were you doing
Tuesday night?

408
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:13,840
Tuesday.

409
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,280
Tuesday night, I was...

410
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:21,320
I was with a friend
at a pre-auction viewing.

411
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,800
She'll verify that?

412
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:28,360
We're talking about a woman
of substance here.

413
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:31,360
I think she enjoys her privacy.

414
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:36,240
..if that's what this is
to you. OK? I don't want it!

415
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,560
Come over here.

416
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:42,080
You can't mix May and December.
It just never...

417
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,440
Maybe she likes the guy, huh?

418
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:50,160
- I'm sorry.
- Am I a suspect?

419
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:53,840
No, but we'll have to check
your alibi for your sake.

420
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:58,000
Now, this work that you were
doing for the Rheimans,

421
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:01,720
was this as a translator
or a chauffeur?

422
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:05,280
Neither. This was...

423
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:08,440
This was more of a personal matter.

424
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:12,400
- You're friends?
- Not exactly.

425
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,760
Not exactly. All right, then.

426
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:20,440
What exactly is it
that you were doing for the Rheimans?

427
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:23,880
Nothing special.

428
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,640
Chit-chat. I don't know.

429
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:31,840
I have a hard time remembering
these things. I meet a lot of people.

430
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:35,080
Yes, yes.
No, I understand your problem.

431
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:39,040
You got there, you had a few drinks.
Next thing, you're back in LA?

432
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:41,440
More or less.
You want another cup of coffee?

433
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,760
That's bullshit. I'm taking you in.
It'll be good for your memory.

434
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:49,440
You seem like a young man
who needs a little self-improvement.

435
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,560
Look, Mr Sunday...

436
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,600
Detective Sunday.

437
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:01,840
Look, Detective...

438
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:07,160
I want to cooperate with the police
in any way I can, but these...

439
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,720
these are very delicate matters...

440
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:15,400
things that may not fall
under the exact letter of the law.

441
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:19,080
Publicity's the last thing I want.

442
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:24,080
I'm not gonna book you or
take away your chauffeur's license.

443
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:29,880
I'm not gonna bring you up on drug
charges. I could do all of that.

444
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:31,920
Just tell me about the Rheimans.

445
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:36,840
Please welcome Charles Stratton.

446
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,600
Mack, thank you.

447
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:53,200
I hope you're having
as good a time as us...

448
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:58,480
trying to figure out
what the stuff is on our plates.

449
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:02,000
But most of all,
I'm happy to have the opportunity

450
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:05,240
to speak to you in an informal way

451
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:08,560
about the problems
facing southern California.

452
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:12,240
More than any other
community in the country...

453
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,960
Do you follow
California politics, Julian?

454
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:17,360
Not very much.

455
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:20,200
You're smart. They're all whores.

456
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:24,000
..but we also have the technological
means and know-how

457
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:28,440
to help free America
from the grip of fossil fuels.

458
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:31,960
In times of austerity like these,

459
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:35,640
it is the privileged
who should lead the way,

460
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:39,040
who should set an example
for the rest of the country.

461
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:42,200
This guy is a real comer.

462
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,360
She's pretty, isn't she?

463
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:04,120
Yes, very.

464
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,880
Jim, Thank you for coming.
You know Michelle.

465
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:12,480
Mrs Laudner, how nice of you to come.
It's a pleasure to see you.

466
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,840
Bullshit. Can we talk later?

467
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:17,760
Certainly. Mrs Laudner,
my wife Michelle.

468
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,080
How do you do?

469
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:23,560
- And this is Julian Kay.
- It's an honour. Enjoyed the speech.

470
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:27,360
Mrs Stratton.

471
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,080
You're a fortunate man, Senator.

472
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:36,880
- You know what he is.
- That boy will go far.

473
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:39,280
Got a nice wife, too.

474
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:42,440
- Tell me about them.
- I told you he's a comer.

475
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:46,280
No. I want to hear
about them as a couple.

476
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:49,480
- How is their marriage?
- Julian, you are incorrigible!

477
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:51,800
No, I want to hear about it.

478
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:53,840
I hear she's very unhappy.

479
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,560
- Julian!
- Well, hello.

480
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,920
What a surprise.

481
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,440
- You do a lot of shopping here?
- No. Just browsing.

482
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,160
Just browsing.

483
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,920
Well, I gotta go.
Lot of appointments.

484
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,680
Been very nice talking to you...
Mrs Stratton.

485
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:14,560
Wait.

486
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,240
I have to talk to you.

487
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:26,160
Yeah. Me, too.

488
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,160
Want to have a drink?

489
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:33,600
It's kind of early for a drink.

490
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:37,800
Maybe we do that in about an hour.
What do you think?

491
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:39,840
I think you're awful.

492
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,720
I think you're right.

493
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:43,160
Come on.

494
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,720
I've seen your husband
on television.

495
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:53,400
He's very impressive.

496
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:55,440
What's that supposed to mean?

497
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:01,280
Nothing. I'm sorry.

498
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:06,320
I would never do anything
to hurt him politically.

499
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,680
I could never leave him.

500
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:14,120
Don't let him blackmail you.

501
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:17,400
He has this big
political thing about...

502
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:20,440
having...a family.

503
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:24,840
He keeps wanting me to be pregnant.

504
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:30,280
What are we talking about here?
What he wants or what you want?

505
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:33,840
I can't tell any more.

506
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:38,480
What can I do?

507
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:43,560
I don't know.

508
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:45,720
Be yourself.

509
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:49,640
Leave him?

510
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:53,800
His career will survive.

511
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:55,760
People forget.

512
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:01,280
These things have to
be done quietly.

513
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:11,600
Don't let him fool you with his talk
about duty and self-sacrifice.

514
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:16,520
He's getting exactly what he wants.
You've got to do the same.

515
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:19,080
Take your pleasure when you can.

516
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:24,560
How about you? Where do you come in?

517
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:27,760
How do you get pleasure?

518
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:59,240
What a surprise. Mr Kay.

519
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:01,240
Detective Sunday.

520
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:04,360
You are full of surprises.
Come on in. Sit down.

521
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:08,760
- Take a shine. You need it.
- Thank you. You're dressed up today.

522
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:10,680
I'm going to the country club.

523
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:14,560
To the country club.
We checked on your alibi.

524
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:19,440
Mrs Williams said you had
been with her Tuesday night.

525
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,760
But...

526
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:25,240
you dropped her off at 7:00.

527
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:27,520
The Rheiman murder was at 10:00.

528
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:28,640
Shit.

529
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,640
I described the house, the bedroom.

530
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:34,840
She said
you were helping her redecorate

531
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:37,360
and you' d been picking
out a bureau...

532
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:40,600
I understand why.
She has a reputation to protect.

533
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:44,160
How do you do it, Julian?

534
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:49,800
This afternoon with Mrs Jarvey
and tonight at the country club.

535
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:53,520
How do you seduce
all these women, huh?

536
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:57,520
I don't like you poking around
in my private life, Sunday...

537
00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:00,120
bugging my friends.

538
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:05,120
I'll tell you what.
You lay off my clients,

539
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:08,200
I'll give you a few pointers
picking up women.

540
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:10,120
How's that?

541
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:15,040
First, obviously, you dress for shit.

542
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:19,840
Anybody can fix that, no problem.
It's your face. Bad face.

543
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:23,760
And that body? You have back
problems? You look like a monkey.

544
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:26,480
Hey, back. Shoulders back.

545
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:30,000
And your jaw, work the jaw.
Ex ercise. You don't want it slack.

546
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:32,520
Up tight, tight. Tight, yes.

547
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:38,960
Would you be willing
to come in for a line-up?

548
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:44,240
- Sure. Why not?
- Doesn't it ever bother you, Julian?

549
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:46,480
- What?
- What you do.

550
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:52,280
Giving pleasure to women?
I'm supposed to feel guilty?

551
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:56,880
- But it's not legal.
- Legal is not always right.

552
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:00,080
Men make laws.
Sometimes they're wrong.

553
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:05,600
They're stupid...or jealous.

554
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:07,720
And you know better?

555
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:11,000
Some people are above the law.

556
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:14,000
How do these people
know who they are?

557
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:15,480
They know.

558
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:19,760
They ask themselves.

559
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:23,280
Eugene, thanks.
I'll take care of you in a minute.

560
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:24,440
Yes, sir.

561
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:27,800
- May I?
- Please.

562
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:30,920
Yeah, the other one
could use some work.

563
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:36,440
Why didn't you tell me
you handcuffed Mrs Rheiman?

564
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:42,400
- I didn't.
- Yeah, you said that.

565
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:45,040
That's why I checked twice
with the coroner.

566
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:48,560
Apparently, she must have
put up quite a struggle.

567
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:51,960
There were cuts on her wrists
from being handcuffed.

568
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:56,320
Underneath the cuts were bruises from
where she was handcuffed earlier.

569
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,600
The coroner estimates
about 48 hours earlier,

570
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:02,040
which would be the night
you were there.

571
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:07,680
Jesus Christ.

572
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:11,800
She was beaten with
a heavy metal object,

573
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:14,960
raped and violated...with an object,

574
