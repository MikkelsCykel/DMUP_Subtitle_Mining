00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:05,442
<i> Prosper, they can't</i>
<i>send you to the orphanage.</i>

2
00:01:05,546 --> 00:01:09,474
<i>- They can't. You're a brother.</i>
<i>We have to stick together.</i>

3
00:01:09,578 --> 00:01:13,473
<i>Prosper, please don't leave me.</i>
<i>Don't leave me.</i>

4
00:01:45,191 --> 00:01:47,079
Bo.

5
00:01:50,855 --> 00:01:52,743
Prosper.

6
00:01:57,511 --> 00:02:00,031
Have you got your things?

7
00:02:00,135 --> 00:02:02,339
- We have to go fast.
- I knew you wouldn't leave me with them.

8
00:02:04,391 --> 00:02:06,213
<i>Come on.</i>

9
00:02:07,303 --> 00:02:09,190
Jump.

10
00:02:09,286 --> 00:02:10,781
<i>Quick, Bo. Jump.</i>

11
00:02:15,079 --> 00:02:17,446
I pumped it up yesterday.

12
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:25,154
<i>I knew it. I knew it! That wretched brother!</i>

13
00:02:25,254 --> 00:02:28,669
Come back here, you... kidnapper!

14
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:31,588
You'll be locked away
for good this time!

15
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:36,224
Oh! Oh, my poor little baby!

16
00:02:40,804 --> 00:02:43,324
Prop, where's this train going?

17
00:02:43,428 --> 00:02:45,250
Hopefully south.

18
00:02:47,045 --> 00:02:49,313
Hey, Bo, give us a hand.

19
00:02:51,876 --> 00:02:54,461
Oh, push! Bo, push!

20
00:03:12,324 --> 00:03:15,585
Are we nearly there?

21
00:03:15,682 --> 00:03:18,049
Almost.

22
00:03:43,713 --> 00:03:46,746
Look, Prop, gondolas.

23
00:03:46,848 --> 00:03:50,045
<i>What are you doin' opening the boxes?</i>
<i>Put 'em back.</i>

24
00:03:50,145 --> 00:03:52,960
I didn't. This one
was open already.

25
00:03:53,057 --> 00:03:55,577
Put 'em back anyway.
They don't belong to us.

26
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:23,069
<i>Buongiorno.</i>
You'd appear to be looking for me.

27
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:27,542
"Victor Getz, investigations
of all kinds." Follow me.

28
00:04:31,262 --> 00:04:34,558
I came across these tortoises
at the fish market.

29
00:04:34,654 --> 00:04:36,541
Poor wrinkled things.

30
00:04:36,638 --> 00:04:40,893
Freezing their little bottoms off
amongst all that ice.

31
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:58,168
- Come on. We have to go.
<i>- What's the matter?</i>

32
00:04:58,269 --> 00:05:00,179
<i>Just do as I say,</i>
<i>all right?</i>

33
00:05:00,285 --> 00:05:02,260
Oi! Oi, what do you think-

34
00:05:02,365 --> 00:05:05,365
<i>Where do you think you're going?</i>
<i>Won't have little thieves on my boat!</i>

35
00:05:05,468 --> 00:05:07,705
- Get off! Let go!
- Give 'em here!

36
00:05:07,804 --> 00:05:10,171
- Give it!
- What have you stolen?

37
00:05:11,868 --> 00:05:14,584
Come on, Bo.
Come on.

38
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:18,707
Come on. Come on.
Hurry up! Hurry up!

39
00:05:23,547 --> 00:05:27,322
Disguise, madam. A necessity
in my line of business, you understand?

40
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:31,314
So, what can I do for you?

41
00:05:31,419 --> 00:05:33,655
Anything lost or stolen?

42
00:05:33,755 --> 00:05:36,275
This is what we have lost.

43
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:38,200
Oh, children.

44
00:05:38,298 --> 00:05:40,567
I've tracked down
many things in my time-

45
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:43,601
suitcases, dogs, the occasional husband-

46
00:05:43,706 --> 00:05:48,462
But you're the first clients
who've ever mislaid their children...

47
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:50,709
- Mr. And Mrs. -
- Hartlieb.

48
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:55,087
Mr. And Mrs.
Maximilian Hartlieb.

49
00:05:55,194 --> 00:05:57,016
And they are not
our children.

50
00:05:57,114 --> 00:06:00,976
<i>Prosper and Boniface</i>
<i>are my late sister's sons.</i>

51
00:06:01,081 --> 00:06:04,430
She raised the boys
on her own.

52
00:06:04,537 --> 00:06:08,432
Oh, Prosper and Boniface.
What peculiarly charming names.

53
00:06:08,537 --> 00:06:11,025
Yes, well, my late sister
had a fondness...

54
00:06:11,128 --> 00:06:13,267
for anything peculiar.

55
00:06:13,369 --> 00:06:16,914
However, when she died,
three months ago...

56
00:06:17,016 --> 00:06:20,562
my husband and I applied
for custody of Boniface.

57
00:06:20,664 --> 00:06:24,276
<i> Well, we could hardly be</i>
<i>expected to take on his older brother as well.</i>

58
00:06:24,376 --> 00:06:28,052
I mean, any reasonable person
could see that.

59
00:06:28,152 --> 00:06:31,218
- Prosper kidnapped Bo a week ago-
- Mm-hmm.

60
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,142
And brought him here to Venice.

61
00:06:33,239 --> 00:06:35,280
And what makes you so sure
that they came here...

62
00:06:35,383 --> 00:06:38,317
- if you don't mind-
- Their mother loved Venice.

63
00:06:38,423 --> 00:06:40,943
<i>She planned to move here</i>
<i>with the boys...</i>

64
00:06:41,047 --> 00:06:43,894
<i>filled their heads with</i>
<i>all manner of hocus-pocus...</i>

65
00:06:43,991 --> 00:06:46,576
<i>about the magical things</i>
<i>that happen here.</i>

66
00:06:50,455 --> 00:06:52,397
I'm hungry.

67
00:07:02,806 --> 00:07:04,846
It's the last one.

68
00:07:08,662 --> 00:07:10,550
Have we got any more money?

69
00:07:10,645 --> 00:07:12,979
Don't worry.
I'll find us enough to eat.

70
00:07:13,078 --> 00:07:15,564
I know, 'cause you're
my big bro.

71
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:32,691
Okay.

72
00:07:32,788 --> 00:07:35,308
Wait here, okay?

73
00:07:35,412 --> 00:07:37,037
Where are you going?

74
00:08:04,339 --> 00:08:05,833
<i>Scusi.</i>

75
00:08:05,938 --> 00:08:08,426
- I was gonna put it back!
- That's what they all say!

76
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,919
<i>Come on!</i>

77
00:08:12,371 --> 00:08:14,443
Stop, thief!

78
00:08:15,794 --> 00:08:18,249
<i>Get back here!</i>

79
00:08:54,223 --> 00:08:56,940
I think we lost him.

80
00:09:00,271 --> 00:09:02,792
I think we lost ourselves as well.

81
00:09:02,896 --> 00:09:05,481
- Prop?
- Hmm?

82
00:09:05,584 --> 00:09:08,966
When you have no money,
do you have to run away from everyone?

83
00:09:09,072 --> 00:09:11,341
We're not running away
anymore, Bo.

84
00:09:11,439 --> 00:09:13,381
Mum wanted us to be here.

85
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:16,650
- This is where we live now.
- Here?

86
00:09:19,215 --> 00:09:23,524
No, silly. In Venice. There must be
a reason why she loved it so much.

87
00:09:28,141 --> 00:09:32,004
- What?
- Th-The fish man looked at me.

88
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:36,071
<i>You're tired. The shadows</i>
<i>can play tricks on you in the night.</i>

89
00:09:36,173 --> 00:09:38,694
- Are you lost?
- No.

90
00:09:38,797 --> 00:09:41,066
You look lost to me.

91
00:09:41,165 --> 00:09:43,303
Who are you? What do you want?

92
00:09:43,405 --> 00:09:46,307
Questions better put by me to you.

93
00:09:46,412 --> 00:09:48,551
Prosper. My little brother, Bo.

94
00:09:48,653 --> 00:09:51,019
Have you lost
your mummy and daddy?

95
00:09:51,117 --> 00:09:53,702
<i>- Yes, as a matter of fact.</i>
- Then I'll help you find them.

96
00:09:53,804 --> 00:09:58,027
<i>You can't. They're</i>-
<i>They're not with us anymore.</i>

97
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:01,191
Ah, orphans. And so young.

98
00:10:04,363 --> 00:10:07,114
Now, tell me...

99
00:10:07,212 --> 00:10:09,034
what did you steal?

100
00:10:09,132 --> 00:10:11,619
<i>Money, jewels?</i>
<i>Are you lock-pickers?</i>

101
00:10:11,723 --> 00:10:14,822
Purse-pickers?
Pocket-pickers?

102
00:10:14,923 --> 00:10:16,810
We're not thieves.

103
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:19,875
<i>Please just leave us alone.</i>
<i>We have no money.</i>

104
00:10:19,979 --> 00:10:22,117
Now run along home,
wherever that may be.

105
00:10:22,219 --> 00:10:25,383
- This is where we live now.
- Don't be ridiculous.

106
00:10:25,482 --> 00:10:27,621
<i>Do you know</i>
<i>what happens here after dark?</i>

107
00:10:27,723 --> 00:10:30,657
Things little eyes
should never, ever see.

108
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:33,217
- We're not scared.
- Not scared?

109
00:10:33,323 --> 00:10:35,264
Well, aren't you
the little tiger?

110
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:37,857
We're not scared of here. We're not scared of you.

111
00:10:37,962 --> 00:10:41,061
Good. Then follow me to safety.

112
00:10:41,162 --> 00:10:43,201
Right this way.

113
00:10:43,305 --> 00:10:46,982
Or would you rather sleep
in the dark and damp doorways?

114
00:10:48,937 --> 00:10:51,523
Did I mention the rats?

115
00:10:53,546 --> 00:10:55,433
What have we got
to lose, Prop?

116
00:11:13,608 --> 00:11:16,391
Gentlemen, my humble abode...

117
00:11:16,488 --> 00:11:18,692
the Stella...

118
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:21,443
our star lair.

119
00:11:21,544 --> 00:11:23,878
Strictly no grown-ups
allowed.

120
00:11:26,023 --> 00:11:29,700
You're not a grown-up, are you?
Only some of them are very small.

121
00:11:29,798 --> 00:11:32,417
You wouldn't be trying to trick me
on my own turf, would you?

122
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:34,722
I'm six and a quarter.

123
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:39,461
That makes you a V.I.P.

124
00:11:39,558 --> 00:11:41,598
You give me the willies
every time you're late.

125
00:11:41,703 --> 00:11:44,223
- Have I ever let you down?
- What are they doing here?

126
00:11:44,327 --> 00:11:47,457
They need my help,
just like you did, Riccio, dear boy.

127
00:11:47,558 --> 00:11:49,381
Remember?

128
00:11:51,494 --> 00:11:54,941
We've been stakin' out the Palazzo Pisani
for days, like you told us.

129
00:11:55,045 --> 00:11:58,176
<i>- It's always crowded. Parties and things.</i>
- Then I'll fit in perfectly.

130
00:11:58,309 --> 00:12:00,644
- Are you thieves or something?
- Not just any thieves.

131
00:12:00,741 --> 00:12:02,748
Scip's the Thief Lord,
the greatest thief in Venice.

132
00:12:02,854 --> 00:12:05,220
<i>Aren't you scared of the police?</i>

133
00:12:16,709 --> 00:12:21,498
2:00. Typical. Steal a watch next time.
We were gonna send out a search party.

134
00:12:21,605 --> 00:12:25,532
This little fellow has a nasty cough. Do you have
anything for it in your medicine cupboard?

135
00:12:25,636 --> 00:12:28,897
- Who are they?
- They're friends of mine.

136
00:12:28,996 --> 00:12:32,311
<i>They need to crash here.</i>
<i>Enough said?</i>

137
00:12:33,699 --> 00:12:36,088
Here comes Matron
with her magic potion.

138
00:12:36,195 --> 00:12:39,327
It's all right.
I won't bite. I'm Hornet.

139
00:12:39,427 --> 00:12:41,249
This is the wardrobe.

140
00:12:41,347 --> 00:12:44,663
- You're burning up. Does it hurt when you cough?
- Help yourselves. Really.

141
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:47,356
Well, he won't get better
in these sodden old rags.

142
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:50,655
We have to go back and pick up my haul.
I left it somewhere near the Contarini.

143
00:12:50,754 --> 00:12:54,103
- In the middle of the night?
- What's it, past your beddy-byes, Mosca?

144
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:56,795
I don't think it'd be good for him,
walking around in the night.

145
00:12:56,898 --> 00:12:59,199
I don't recall saying
anything about walking.

146
00:13:02,721 --> 00:13:05,755
Whoa, Scip!
How'd you steal this?

147
00:13:05,858 --> 00:13:07,745
Nothing's safe from the Thief Lord.

148
00:13:07,841 --> 00:13:10,111
Go faster, Scip! Faster!

149
00:13:10,209 --> 00:13:12,827
- Hold on!
- The best.

150
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:16,312
This is the police.
Slow down your boat and stop.

151
00:13:16,417 --> 00:13:18,938
Come on, Scip. Step on it.

152
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:21,430
- Step on it!
- Quicker, Scip!

153
00:13:21,537 --> 00:13:24,188
<i>I repeat, this is the police.</i>

154
00:13:24,289 --> 00:13:27,070
<i>- Slow down and stop the boat!</i>

155
00:13:27,168 --> 00:13:30,070
Quick, Scip. They're gettin' closer!

156
00:13:30,177 --> 00:13:33,143
Faster! Faster!

157
00:13:33,249 --> 00:13:36,958
<i>- Scip, come on!</i>

158
00:13:40,671 --> 00:13:44,020
<i>- Shouldn't we stop?</i>
- What, and ruin the fun?

159
00:13:49,855 --> 00:13:52,638
- What do we do now?
- Watch this.

160
00:13:52,735 --> 00:13:54,906
<i>Look out!</i>

161
00:13:56,447 --> 00:13:58,716
Oh, no!

162
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,350
Is it gold?

163
00:14:07,454 --> 00:14:11,709
Gold, silver, glittering jewels,
plucked from the grown-ups.

164
00:14:11,806 --> 00:14:14,075
Put it down.
They stole it.

165
00:14:14,174 --> 00:14:16,346
Boy, one day, they're gonna
catch you, Scip.

166
00:14:16,446 --> 00:14:19,064
Take everything to Barbarossa,
and try and get a decent price this time.

167
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:21,784
How? He just laughs at us.
The fat pig.

168
00:14:21,885 --> 00:14:24,568
- Prop can do it. He's great at selling things.
- Hey.

169
00:14:24,669 --> 00:14:27,124
<i>When we sold my old toys</i>
<i>at the secondhand shop...</i>

170
00:14:27,228 --> 00:14:30,611
they tried to give us peanuts,
so he just went-

171
00:14:30,717 --> 00:14:33,050
<i>like a stone,</i>
<i>so they gave us lots more money.</i>

172
00:14:33,148 --> 00:14:35,570
- Bo.
- Okay. You try.

173
00:14:35,676 --> 00:14:37,749
And if you manage to outfox
the old scoundrel...

174
00:14:37,852 --> 00:14:40,405
<i>you and your brother can</i>
<i>stay as long as you like.</i>

175
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,464
Your big moment,
Mr. Stoney Face.

176
00:14:56,667 --> 00:14:59,984
What are you smiling at,
hedgehog boy?

177
00:15:00,091 --> 00:15:01,979
Go and wait in the office.

178
00:15:02,076 --> 00:15:03,963
Don't touch anything,
understood?

179
00:15:08,155 --> 00:15:09,976
What a rude man.

180
00:15:10,074 --> 00:15:12,594
I call him fat, oily
slaphead slimeball.

181
00:15:12,698 --> 00:15:16,014
All right, let the dog
see the bone.

182
00:15:30,042 --> 00:15:34,514
There are a couple of decent
items here, so I'm going to offer...

183
00:15:34,616 --> 00:15:37,846
a hundred, which is very generous.

184
00:15:37,945 --> 00:15:40,531
Well, let's just say
I'm in a generous mood today.

185
00:15:41,944 --> 00:15:44,465
A thousand or no deal.

186
00:15:48,056 --> 00:15:50,958
Have you lost your mind, boy?

187
00:15:51,065 --> 00:15:54,413
<i>I make you a generous offer</i>-
<i>too generous</i>-

188
00:15:54,521 --> 00:15:57,837
and you insult me
with fanciful nonsense.

189
00:15:57,944 --> 00:16:02,963
Tell the Thief Lord to send the boat boy
or the hornet girl next time...

190
00:16:03,063 --> 00:16:08,148
if he wants to continue doing business
with Ernesto Barbarossa.

191
00:16:08,247 --> 00:16:11,411
I'm the Thief Lord's
official negotiator now.

192
00:16:17,303 --> 00:16:21,297
300 for the lot.
Most of it's rubbish.

193
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:23,254
Eight.

194
00:16:24,823 --> 00:16:26,862
Four.

195
00:16:26,966 --> 00:16:29,453
- Seven.
- 475.

196
00:16:29,558 --> 00:16:32,340
687 and a half.

197
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:35,501
<i>You're a clever lad...</i>

198
00:16:35,605 --> 00:16:37,777
so...

199
00:16:37,877 --> 00:16:40,332
I'm going to give you...

200
00:16:40,438 --> 00:16:43,373
500.

201
00:16:43,478 --> 00:16:45,966
That's the last time I let you
treat me like a child.

202
00:16:49,589 --> 00:16:51,859
One more thing.

203
00:16:51,957 --> 00:16:54,956
A client of mine is looking
for someone who will-

204
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:58,126
Shall we say, procure
a certain item for him?

205
00:16:58,229 --> 00:17:00,498
If he's sick, why doesn't he
go to the doctor?

206
00:17:00,597 --> 00:17:02,801
He's looking for someone
who'll steal something for him.

207
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,104
Is that clear enough
for your mucky ears?

208
00:17:05,204 --> 00:17:07,092
And tell the Thief Lord...

209
00:17:07,188 --> 00:17:09,162
that there's big money
in it for him.

210
00:17:09,267 --> 00:17:11,178
Mmm? Mmm, mmm, mmm.

211
00:17:11,316 --> 00:17:14,250
Stop it. It tickles.

212
00:17:14,355 --> 00:17:16,243
Just a little more.

213
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:18,162
You need to stay
in bed for a bit.

214
00:17:18,259 --> 00:17:22,699
Where were you goin'? And what would you
have done if Scipio hadn't picked you up?

215
00:17:22,803 --> 00:17:24,691
I think we could've managed it.

216
00:17:24,787 --> 00:17:26,991
Prop's very brave,
and I'm good at cheering him up...

217
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:29,425
so we make a good team.

218
00:17:29,522 --> 00:17:32,205
We all take care of each other here.
All of us are orphans too.

219
00:17:32,307 --> 00:17:36,714
I'm not an orphan! My dad went away
in a ship, and he hasn't come back here...

220
00:17:36,819 --> 00:17:39,502
<i>but he thinks of me all the time.</i>

221
00:17:39,602 --> 00:17:42,188
- That's what he keeps telling us.
- It's true!

222
00:17:42,289 --> 00:17:44,973
One day, I'll sail all over the world,
and I'll find him!

223
00:17:45,074 --> 00:17:49,481
I believe you, Mosca.

224
00:17:49,617 --> 00:17:53,360
Prosper, Scipio will never
let anyone sell his loot ever again.

225
00:17:53,457 --> 00:17:55,823
Boy, we never dare talk
to Fatty Slaphead like that.

226
00:17:55,922 --> 00:17:58,704
Yeah, well, those things
are probably worth even more.

227
00:18:01,873 --> 00:18:04,394
Prosper, come back!

228
00:18:06,513 --> 00:18:09,829
Prosper, come back.
I've got to get some of this.

229
00:18:09,936 --> 00:18:13,198
Look at all this stuff.
Let's celebrate, Prop.

230
00:18:19,792 --> 00:18:21,734
We should get the money
back to the others first.

231
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,742
Excuse me, son.
Your name's Prosper, isn't it?

232
00:18:27,631 --> 00:18:32,301
Whoo-hoo! Take that, furry face!

233
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,301
<i>Hey, come back!</i>
<i>What's the matter?</i>

234
00:18:39,567 --> 00:18:42,087
Victor?

235
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:44,231
Ciao, Victor.

236
00:18:44,334 --> 00:18:46,603
You can't fool me
with that mustache.

237
00:18:46,703 --> 00:18:49,158
Oh, excuse me, Ida, but I'm on a case.
I can't talk now.

238
00:18:49,263 --> 00:18:52,295
Oh, hope I didn't ruin anything.
Suits you though.

239
00:18:52,398 --> 00:18:55,497
<i>Oh, I'm so sorry.</i>

240
00:18:55,598 --> 00:18:57,420
<i>Why are you running?</i>

241
00:18:57,518 --> 00:19:00,453
<i>- That man knew my name.</i>
- So what?

242
00:19:00,557 --> 00:19:02,444
So what?

243
00:19:05,709 --> 00:19:08,611
Okay. Cool it. So what if he knew your name?

244
00:19:08,718 --> 00:19:11,368
- I think he's trying to get me.
- I think you were trying to nick our money.

245
00:19:11,469 --> 00:19:13,738
Yeah, and leave
my brother behind?

246
00:19:13,838 --> 00:19:17,415
All that cash- I thought
you were trying to trick me.

247
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:21,542
Oh, man. Maybe you're right.

248
00:19:21,644 --> 00:19:24,361
I know. This way.

249
00:19:27,883 --> 00:19:30,666
<i>- Who is he?</i>
- Some kind of private detective.

250
00:19:30,764 --> 00:19:32,738
Victor the snooper-
That's what they call him.

251
00:19:45,515 --> 00:19:48,068
<i>Hey! Wait, wait.</i>
<i>Whoa, whoa.</i>

252
00:19:56,298 --> 00:19:58,120
Hey!

253
00:19:59,339 --> 00:20:01,226
Here's to Prop.

254
00:20:01,323 --> 00:20:03,908
Cheers.

255
00:20:04,009 --> 00:20:06,214
From now on,
our chief loot seller.

256
00:20:06,314 --> 00:20:09,063
In fact, you've done so well, I think
I'm gonna give myself a little break.

257
00:20:09,161 --> 00:20:12,227
But you can't stop. Not now.
Barbarossa's got a customer.

258
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:15,111
<i>He's lookin' for a thief.</i>
<i>Said there's big money in it.</i>

259
00:20:15,209 --> 00:20:17,631
And I'll help you, Scip.
I'll come with you.

260
00:20:17,737 --> 00:20:19,395
No, you won't.
Don't be so stupid.

261
00:20:19,498 --> 00:20:23,075
Scipio gave me the kittens, so I'm gonna
help him with the stealing, and that's that.

262
00:20:25,001 --> 00:20:28,416
I'll do it. Bigger money
equals bigger plans.

263
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:32,198
- And bigger cakes to buy.
- See?

264
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,796
<i>Va bene.</i>

265
00:20:37,896 --> 00:20:41,158
My customer will meet
the Thief Lord in the confessional...

266
00:20:41,255 --> 00:20:45,150
<i>at the back left</i>
<i>of the Basilica San Marco.</i>

267
00:20:45,256 --> 00:20:48,420
Mmm. And the Conte...

268
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:51,584
likes to shroud himself
in mystery.

269
00:20:51,688 --> 00:20:56,444
- Is he a real <i>conte?</i>
- Are you deaf? What did I just say?

270
00:20:56,551 --> 00:21:00,927
<i>As far as your stupid head</i>
<i>is concerned, he is the Conte.</i>

271
00:21:01,031 --> 00:21:03,234
Now, is there anything more
you need to know?

272
00:21:03,334 --> 00:21:05,538
No need to fly off the handle.

273
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:10,046
- What time?
- Tomorrow afternoon, 3:00 sharp.

274
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:14,754
And I reserve the right to fly off the handle
whenever I feel like it. Thank you very much.

275
00:21:15,814 --> 00:21:18,301
3:00, back left chapel...

276
00:21:18,406 --> 00:21:20,610
basilica, confessional.

277
00:21:20,709 --> 00:21:24,058
- Got it. Come on, Prop.
- Hold on, hedgehog boy.

278
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:27,711
Now, you and your snotty little friend
can tag along if you want...

279
00:21:27,813 --> 00:21:30,748
<i>but your master has</i>
<i>to be there in person...</i>

280
00:21:30,854 --> 00:21:34,301
<i>- Got it?</i>
- But the Thief Lord won't like that at all.

281
00:21:34,404 --> 00:21:37,503
Won't he? Well,
he'll have to live with it.

282
00:21:37,605 --> 00:21:40,354
Otherwise he doesn't
get the job.

283
00:21:59,683 --> 00:22:02,433
<i>Hey, Victor.</i>

284
00:22:02,531 --> 00:22:04,670
You know, I preferred you
with a mustache.

285
00:22:04,771 --> 00:22:07,641
Ida! What brings you here?

286
00:22:07,747 --> 00:22:10,746
Oh, I'm just out and about
with my camera.

287
00:22:10,851 --> 00:22:13,436
Oh, am I, uh, interrupting
important detective work again?

288
00:22:13,539 --> 00:22:16,637
- Well, I am still on the case.
<i>- Oh, how exciting.</i>

289
00:22:16,738 --> 00:22:20,000
<i>- What sort of case?</i>
- Well, I can tell you that it involves kids.

290
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:24,097
Well, I'm sure they're innocent.

291
00:22:24,194 --> 00:22:27,543
No, no, no. This case
isn't about guilt or innocence.

292
00:22:29,826 --> 00:22:31,996
<i>Look, if children are in trouble...</i>

293
00:22:32,097 --> 00:22:35,196
it's usually because they've been
misled or used by adults.

294
00:22:35,297 --> 00:22:37,185
You should lock up the parents.

295
00:22:47,104 --> 00:22:50,584
Well, I'm sure I'll be running into you
again, when you're up to no good.

296
00:22:53,312 --> 00:22:57,884
Anyway, drop by and
see my new house one of these days...

297
00:22:57,984 --> 00:23:00,701
instead of loitering
on San Marco all the time.

298
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:03,647
- Well, it's just that they say
everyone crosses San-
- Ciao!

299
00:23:03,744 --> 00:23:06,078
Never mind.

300
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:09,492
<i> Prosper, Mosca, you come inside</i>
<i>with me, and the others wait here.</i>

301
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,487
<i>But I don't want to wait here.</i>

302
00:23:11,583 --> 00:23:13,470
<i>Me neither! Why can't we all go?</i>

303
00:23:13,568 --> 00:23:16,884
<i>Because Scipio said so, or is that</i>
<i>not a good enough reason for you?</i>

304
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:34,715
I don't like churches.

305
00:23:34,814 --> 00:23:36,756
They give me the creeps.

306
00:23:52,189 --> 00:23:54,262
Perhaps he's not here yet.

307
00:23:56,637 --> 00:23:59,571
One should not wear a mask
in church...

308
00:23:59,677 --> 00:24:01,499
any more than a hat.

309
00:24:03,036 --> 00:24:05,425
One should not plan a theft
in a confessional either...

310
00:24:05,532 --> 00:24:08,085
and that's what
we're here for, right?

311
00:24:08,188 --> 00:24:12,825
So, you are the Thief Lord.

312
00:24:12,924 --> 00:24:17,081
Well, keep your mask if you must.
I can still see that you are very young.

313
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:19,831
Yes, and you're very old.

314
00:24:19,931 --> 00:24:23,543
<i>- Does age matter in this transaction?</i>
- Not in the least.

315
00:24:23,644 --> 00:24:27,124
<i>So-</i>

316
00:24:27,228 --> 00:24:30,392
Signor Barbarossa
has surely told you...

317
00:24:30,491 --> 00:24:36,186
<i>that I am looking for someone</i>
<i>to retrieve something for me</i>-

318
00:24:36,283 --> 00:24:40,821
something for which I have
searched for many long years.

319
00:24:40,923 --> 00:24:42,745
What about the payment?

320
00:24:42,842 --> 00:24:46,585
I see you are a businessman.

321
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:51,152
Your fee will be 50,000,
payable upon delivery.

322
00:24:51,258 --> 00:24:53,527
<i>50,000?</i>

323
00:24:53,626 --> 00:24:56,342
Sounds like a fair price.

324
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:07,926
<i>Come on, little boy.</i>
<i>Look at me.</i>

325
00:25:08,025 --> 00:25:11,091
Look at the silly old fool
who's playing scarecrow.

326
00:25:11,192 --> 00:25:13,974
<i>Come on.</i>

327
00:25:19,992 --> 00:25:22,097
Hornet, Riccio, look!

328
00:25:22,201 --> 00:25:24,535
What?

329
00:25:27,448 --> 00:25:29,390
Nothing.

330
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:39,698
<i>- Buongiorno.</i>
<i>- You will see</i>
<i>that what you are to steal...</i>

331
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:42,581
is of great value only to me.

332
00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:45,493
<i>It is made neither of gold...</i>

333
00:25:45,592 --> 00:25:47,479
<i>nor of silver...</i>

334
00:25:47,574 --> 00:25:49,265
but of wood.

335
00:25:49,367 --> 00:25:53,229
- When should we deliver it to you?
- As soon as your skills permit.

336
00:25:54,294 --> 00:25:57,076
I am an old man.

337
00:25:57,174 --> 00:26:00,654
I have only one wish
left in this world-

338
00:26:00,758 --> 00:26:05,613
to hold in my hands that which
you are to steal for me.

339
00:26:05,717 --> 00:26:08,270
How do I know
how to find you?

340
00:26:08,374 --> 00:26:12,749
You will find everything you need
in this confessional when I have left.

341
00:26:12,853 --> 00:26:15,570
<i>Send me word of your success,</i>
<i>and you will receive...</i>

342
00:26:15,669 --> 00:26:19,379
<i>a letter from me the very</i>
<i>next day at Barbarossa's.</i>

343
00:26:26,004 --> 00:26:28,339
So, what's your name...

344
00:26:28,437 --> 00:26:30,576
<i>kind fellow, noble knight?</i>

345
00:26:30,676 --> 00:26:34,091
- Bo. What's yours?
- Vict-

346
00:26:34,196 --> 00:26:36,018
Victor?

347
00:26:36,116 --> 00:26:39,182
I'm- I'm a victim
of circumstances.

348
00:26:39,284 --> 00:26:42,600
All these rotten pigeons.

349
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:50,896
A basket. What's inside?

350
00:26:50,995 --> 00:26:53,002
Whatever it is,
I think it's alive.

351
00:26:53,106 --> 00:26:56,205
Don't open it.
It could be a poisonous snake.

352
00:27:10,067 --> 00:27:12,205
It's a homing pigeon.

353
00:27:12,305 --> 00:27:14,346
Don't think it's poisonous.

354
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:18,028
Hey, you know, uh, I live in a hotel
just near the Grand Canal.

355
00:27:18,129 --> 00:27:20,017
- What about you?
- In a cinema.

356
00:27:20,113 --> 00:27:22,285
You live in a cinema?

357
00:27:22,385 --> 00:27:24,273
What, so you can
watch movies all day long?

358
00:27:24,369 --> 00:27:28,014
- No, it's broken, but Mosca's trying to mend it.
- Oh.

359
00:27:28,113 --> 00:27:31,212
Yeah, what's it called?

360
00:27:31,313 --> 00:27:33,768
Can't remember.

361
00:27:33,873 --> 00:27:36,872
Wouldn't it be nice...

362
00:27:36,976 --> 00:27:38,864
if you had a proper house
to live in?

363
00:27:38,961 --> 00:27:42,441
I mean, don't you have any relatives
who could take care of you?

364
00:27:42,544 --> 00:27:46,057
There's my Aunt Esther,
but she's not nice, and she never smiles.

365
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:49,007
Uh-huh. You're telling me.

366
00:27:49,104 --> 00:27:51,493
Where's Bo?

367
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,534
I've got to go.
It was nice talking to you.

368
00:27:54,639 --> 00:27:57,006
You take care of yourself, all right?

369
00:27:57,104 --> 00:28:00,966
<i> It's many times more magnificent</i>
<i>than any photograph can portray.</i>

370
00:28:01,071 --> 00:28:03,885
<i>Furthermore, this city is alive</i>
<i>with tales of magic and enchantment.</i>

371
00:28:05,967 --> 00:28:08,300
<i>... but paying close attention</i>
<i>to the stories and details...</i>

372
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:10,286
<i>which make Venice</i>
<i>so alluring to-</i>

373
00:28:24,749 --> 00:28:27,335
This Victor thingummy-
What did he ask you?

374
00:28:27,437 --> 00:28:29,641
<i>He asked me my name.</i>

375
00:28:29,742 --> 00:28:31,629
Did you tell him?

376
00:28:33,197 --> 00:28:35,586
What else did you
tell him, Bo?

377
00:28:35,693 --> 00:28:37,635
I'm not sure.

378
00:28:37,741 --> 00:28:40,391
Did Aunt Esther send him?

379
00:28:40,494 --> 00:28:42,949
- But he was friendly.
- Bo, how many times do I have to tell you?

380
00:28:43,053 --> 00:28:45,224
- Do not talk to strangers.
- I know. I know.

381
00:28:45,324 --> 00:28:47,844
<i>- But he was funny.</i>
- What was he wearing?

382
00:28:49,741 --> 00:28:51,683
Blue jacket
and a red cap.

383
00:28:51,788 --> 00:28:53,730
<i>And his watch had a moon on it.</i>

384
00:29:10,635 --> 00:29:12,457
<i>Scusi.</i>

385
00:29:12,555 --> 00:29:14,759
I wonder if you'll be so kind
as to tell me the time.

386
00:29:15,916 --> 00:29:18,184
- Yeah, quarter past 4:00.
- Thank you.

387
00:29:18,283 --> 00:29:20,933
That's a truly remarkable
watch you have there.

388
00:29:21,035 --> 00:29:22,976
Does it tell the time
on the moon too?

389
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:31,079
<i>Mmm. Perhaps you're a tourist.</i>
<i>Where are you visiting from?</i>

390
00:29:31,179 --> 00:29:34,757
- I'm an Eskimo. Can't you tell?
- Really? That is fascinating.

391
00:29:43,657 --> 00:29:48,262
Uh, everything's shipshape and
Bristol fashion with your false beard now.

392
00:29:49,385 --> 00:29:51,425
Let me go! I don't
want to go with you!

393
00:29:51,529 --> 00:29:54,279
- Let me go!
- Get off me! I'm not doing-

394
00:29:54,376 --> 00:29:57,954
- In broad daylight!
- Someone call the police!

395
00:29:58,057 --> 00:30:00,577
I took his wallet, so you can find out
some more about the snooper.

396
00:30:00,681 --> 00:30:03,398
- Thank you.
- Come on, Scip. What is it?

397
00:30:03,496 --> 00:30:06,049
- Is that your uncle's?
- Uh, some kind of wing.

398
00:30:06,152 --> 00:30:07,974
Must be a lion's wing.

399
00:30:08,071 --> 00:30:11,814
It's probably an angel's wing,
made of wood, just like the Conte said.

400
00:30:11,912 --> 00:30:14,628
50,000 for a wooden wing?
We must be missing something.

401
00:30:14,728 --> 00:30:17,183
<i>Perhaps this'll explain it.</i>
<i>"The wing in the photograph...</i>

402
00:30:17,287 --> 00:30:19,229
"is the counterpart
to the wing I'm looking for.

403
00:30:19,335 --> 00:30:23,077
"The pigeon's name is Sofia, and she's
a friendly and dependable creature.

404
00:30:23,175 --> 00:30:25,444
When you have the wing, set her free,
and she will find me."

405
00:30:25,543 --> 00:30:27,365
<i>Sofia.</i>

406
00:30:27,463 --> 00:30:29,830
Sofia, do you like
pussycats?

407
00:30:29,927 --> 00:30:32,098
<i> Stake out the house.</i>
<i>Find out everything you can.</i>

408
00:30:32,199 --> 00:30:34,337
I'll meet you there
Wednesday at 10:00.

409
00:30:34,439 --> 00:30:36,773
I have to go now. I'll be out
of the city again for a couple of days.

410
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:40,001
Scip, please, let us
help you with this job.

411
00:30:40,102 --> 00:30:43,397
<i>I mean, not just the staking out,</i>
<i>but the stealing.</i>

412
00:30:43,494 --> 00:30:45,599
Okay. Why not?

413
00:30:45,702 --> 00:30:49,085
You're right. I might need
my trusty cohorts for this assignment.

414
00:31:00,229 --> 00:31:03,076
<i>Buongiorno, Dottore.</i>
Victor Getz.

415
00:31:03,174 --> 00:31:07,134
I, um-Yeah, I understand that you own
a disused picture house- the Stella-

416
00:31:07,236 --> 00:31:10,335
<i>and as I'm writing an article</i>
<i>on the history of Venetian cinema...</i>

417
00:31:10,436 --> 00:31:13,753
I was wondering if I could have
your permission to look around it.

418
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:16,926
- Father, I think the cat's sick.
<i>- Scipio, can't you see I have a visitor?</i>

419
00:31:17,029 --> 00:31:19,712
How often do I have
to tell you to knock?

420
00:31:20,932 --> 00:31:22,971
I just thought-

421
00:31:23,076 --> 00:31:25,443
I just thought
we could, uh, see the vet.

422
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:28,092
I don't give a damn
about your wretched cat!

423
00:31:28,196 --> 00:31:32,026
<i>It's sick because it's just had kittens.</i>
<i>I'm not wasting my money on a vet.</i>

424
00:31:32,132 --> 00:31:34,368
<i>Continue, um, Signor</i>-

425
00:31:34,467 --> 00:31:36,354
Getz.

426
00:31:36,451 --> 00:31:39,996
As I was saying, the history of the Venetian
cinema has many fascinating stories...

427
00:31:40,099 --> 00:31:44,255
a lot of them
involving the Stella.

428
00:31:44,355 --> 00:31:47,770
<i>The tenants couldn't</i>
<i>pay their rent anymore.</i>

429
00:31:47,874 --> 00:31:50,908
Ah, excuse me, Mr. Getz.

430
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:54,272
I believe my distinguished guests
from Rome have just arrived.

431
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:59,072
<i>Yes, you have my permission. Scipio, will you</i>
<i>find this gentleman the key to the Stella?</i>

432
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:02,813
Good day, sir. Send me a copy
of your article as soon as it is published.

433
00:32:02,913 --> 00:32:04,800
My son here will
find you the key.

434
00:32:05,858 --> 00:32:07,680
Hey!

435
00:32:07,777 --> 00:32:09,664
<i>Where do you think</i>
<i>you're going?</i>

436
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:12,128
<i>To warn your pickpocket</i>
<i>girlfriend?</i>

437
00:32:12,225 --> 00:32:14,712
I spent five hours with the carabinieri
because of her.

438
00:32:14,817 --> 00:32:17,206
Hey! Get-

439
00:32:26,017 --> 00:32:28,155
When's your film
going to be finished?

440
00:32:28,256 --> 00:32:31,159
Any day now, but we need
to fix the projector to watch it.

441
00:32:31,264 --> 00:32:34,111
What's it about?

442
00:32:40,095 --> 00:32:42,713
Let me in!

443
00:32:42,815 --> 00:32:45,117
- Okay, I'll go see who it is.
- I'm coming with you.

444
00:32:45,215 --> 00:32:46,906
Hey! You stay here.

445
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:49,396
- Scipio.
- Who else did you think it was?

446
00:32:49,502 --> 00:32:51,837
- You said you were going away.
- Lock the door. Quick!

447
00:32:51,934 --> 00:32:54,837
- You have to get out of here now.
- Get a load of you!

448
00:32:54,943 --> 00:32:57,398
No time to explain.
The snooper's found out about this place.

449
00:32:57,503 --> 00:33:00,602
<i>- Get what you need, and let's go.</i>
- How did the snooper find out?

450
00:33:00,703 --> 00:33:02,971
Where are we supposed to go?

451
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:05,459
We're staying right here.

452
00:33:32,668 --> 00:33:37,621
So, hide-and-seek, is it?

453
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:41,980
You think just because I'm a grown-up
I'm no good at this.

454
00:33:42,077 --> 00:33:44,924
Well, sorry to disappoint you...

455
00:33:45,019 --> 00:33:47,866
but I just happen to be
a first-class seeker.

456
00:33:50,012 --> 00:33:52,467
You can't hide forever,
you know!

457
00:33:52,571 --> 00:33:55,670
What are you gonna live on?
Begging and petty thievery?

458
00:33:55,772 --> 00:33:58,041
Hey, Victor.

459
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:00,179
Have you got a gun?

460
00:34:00,283 --> 00:34:03,218
Yeah, of course.
You want to see it?

461
00:34:03,323 --> 00:34:06,705
I'm not scared.
It's probably a fake one anyway.

462
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:10,258
<i>Well, aren't you</i>
<i>the smarty-pants?</i>

463
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:17,112
<i>Now!</i>

464
00:34:19,737 --> 00:34:21,680
<i>Get him on the floor!</i>

465
00:34:21,786 --> 00:34:23,990
You! Ya brat!

466
00:34:24,089 --> 00:34:27,635
- That'll teach you to cross
swords with the Thief Lord.

467
00:34:27,738 --> 00:34:30,836
- Ask him how he found us.
- Why? He'll just tell us lies like all grown-ups do.

468
00:34:30,937 --> 00:34:33,206
Just throw him in the canal then.

469
00:34:47,576 --> 00:34:49,616
Your boss give you
permission to do that?

470
00:34:49,721 --> 00:34:53,332
- Bet he was trying to poison me with that rag.
- Please calm down.

471
00:34:53,432 --> 00:34:55,438
I'm sorry about the gag.

472
00:34:55,545 --> 00:34:58,544
I have to ask you-What are you
doing here? Go back to sleep.

473
00:34:58,647 --> 00:35:01,233
What are <i>you</i> doing here?
Are you going to throw him in the canal?

474
00:35:01,335 --> 00:35:03,922
Bo, I'm serious!
Go back to bed.

475
00:35:04,024 --> 00:35:05,911
Please don't send me
back to Esther.

476
00:35:06,007 --> 00:35:08,276
Well, someone's got
to look after you.

477
00:35:08,376 --> 00:35:10,896
But Prosper already looks
after me, and Hornet.

478
00:35:10,999 --> 00:35:13,901
Yeah, well, I'm afraid
they're not really old enough.

479
00:35:14,006 --> 00:35:16,276
And the Thief Lord?
He's nearly 16.

480
00:35:16,374 --> 00:35:18,261
Oh, the Thief Lord.

481
00:35:18,359 --> 00:35:20,366
I could tell you a thing or two
about your Scipio.

482
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:22,477
The Thief Lord is none of your business.

483
00:35:22,582 --> 00:35:25,745
Prop, why does he need that?
We're the only ones who can hear him.

484
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:30,285
Thanks, little un.

485
00:35:32,501 --> 00:35:34,389
<i>Fear not.</i>

486
00:35:34,486 --> 00:35:37,901
<i>I have no compunction about</i>
<i>offering you my services 24-7.</i>

487
00:35:38,006 --> 00:35:40,722
<i>As you know,</i>
<i>my wife and I are separated...</i>

488
00:35:40,821 --> 00:35:45,774
<i>but my son is nothing more</i>
<i>than a minor nuisance.</i>

489
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:50,132
I often wonder what
all the fuss is about with children.

490
00:35:50,228 --> 00:35:54,570
In a few days' time, my brother,
who is a retired army captain...

491
00:35:54,677 --> 00:35:57,993
<i>will be moving in to assume responsibility</i>
<i>for his education...</i>

492
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:00,817
<i>on a full-time basis.</i>

493
00:36:00,917 --> 00:36:04,560
<i>Then, at least, we shall get some sense</i>
<i>and discipline knocked into him.</i>

494
00:36:06,452 --> 00:36:09,615
<i>So what do we do now? How do we get in?</i>

495
00:36:12,084 --> 00:36:13,906
Hey, look.

496
00:36:14,003 --> 00:36:16,754
<i>- That must be the housekeeper.</i>

497
00:36:16,851 --> 00:36:18,858
I'll go have
a little chat with her.

498
00:36:22,067 --> 00:36:24,139
Oh, watch out!

499
00:36:24,243 --> 00:36:27,658
What the devil were you meaning
running into me like that?

500
00:36:27,763 --> 00:36:29,933
Are you a thieving little
pickpocket or something?

501
00:36:30,034 --> 00:36:32,904
No, I'm not.
Sorry about your shopping.

502
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:36,555
<i>I'm just looking for Dr. Spavento.</i>
<i>He's my new dentist.</i>

503
00:36:36,658 --> 00:36:39,440
<i>Is that his surgery?</i>

504
00:36:39,538 --> 00:36:41,927
<i>What does he think</i>
<i>he's doing?</i>

505
00:36:42,034 --> 00:36:44,238
<i>- Let me help you with your shopping.</i>
- But-Well-

506
00:36:44,337 --> 00:36:47,566
Where are you going? Well,
what are you doing with my shopping?

507
00:36:47,665 --> 00:36:50,861
<i>- Is this your house?</i>
<i>- Well, it's not mine, of course.</i>

508
00:36:50,961 --> 00:36:53,449
It's Signora Spavento's.

509
00:36:53,553 --> 00:36:55,441
Wait for me!

510
00:36:55,538 --> 00:36:58,385
<i>Goodness, you may as well</i>
<i>carry it into the house.</i>

511
00:36:58,481 --> 00:37:00,302
What about Scip?
Shouldn't we have waited?

512
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,789
Nah, he probably got held up somewhere.
Don't worry. He trusts us.

513
00:37:02,896 --> 00:37:06,574
What are you kids doing? If you don't
want to buy a paper, then get lost.

514
00:37:06,673 --> 00:37:08,494
We're not annoying anyone.

515
00:37:08,592 --> 00:37:12,487
You're annoying me and giving me heartburn
and disturbing my valuable customers.

516
00:37:12,592 --> 00:37:14,567
They're not disturbing me.

517
00:37:14,672 --> 00:37:17,574
Hmm. Very well, signora.
If you say so.

518
00:37:20,272 --> 00:37:23,054
<i>So, what are you all up to?</i>

519
00:37:23,151 --> 00:37:24,974
<i>None of your business.</i>

520
00:37:25,072 --> 00:37:27,527
Charming.

521
00:37:27,631 --> 00:37:29,769
Sorry, signora.
He's just a bit upset.

522
00:37:29,871 --> 00:37:32,238
Well, why don't you go
and find an adventure?

523
00:37:32,335 --> 00:37:35,368
We're not allowed to do anything
without permission from my mother.

524
00:37:35,471 --> 00:37:37,445
Oh, that's a shame.

525
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:40,933
<i>I was always getting into trouble</i>
<i>when I was your age.</i>

526
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:43,908
But it was worth it.
The excitement of the unknown.

527
00:37:44,014 --> 00:37:46,502
That's what my mum used to say
when she was alive.

528
00:37:48,589 --> 00:37:50,793
You must miss her very much.

529
00:37:52,814 --> 00:37:54,636
I do.

530
00:37:59,213 --> 00:38:02,060
<i>Where's Mosca? I told you</i>
<i>not to come to the door.</i>

531
00:38:02,158 --> 00:38:05,223
Mosca's busy. He's fixing
the projector with Victor.

532
00:38:05,325 --> 00:38:07,910
He doing what?

533
00:38:08,013 --> 00:38:10,882
I don't believe it!
Is this your idea of keeping watch?

534
00:38:10,989 --> 00:38:13,128
- Who said you could untie him?
- Calm down, Riccio.

535
00:38:13,229 --> 00:38:16,774
<i>- He gave me his word of honor</i>
<i>that he wouldn't run away.</i>
- Victor's our friend now.

536
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:19,659
Friend? Are you barmy,
you silly baby?

537
00:38:19,756 --> 00:38:22,091
I'm not a silly baby.
And he is my friend, so there.

538
00:38:22,188 --> 00:38:26,377
He's our prisoner, our enemy! Scip's gonna
go ballistic when he finds out about this.

539
00:38:26,476 --> 00:38:28,778
- Where is he anyway?
- He didn't show up.

540
00:38:28,876 --> 00:38:31,331
<i>Oh, you don't say.</i>

541
00:38:31,435 --> 00:38:34,021
What's that supposed to mean?
Spit it out, fat face!

542
00:38:34,123 --> 00:38:37,985
Oh, aren't you
the charming little rodent?

543
00:38:38,092 --> 00:38:40,547
Well, I'm afraid you've all
fallen under the spell of a liar.

544
00:38:42,571 --> 00:38:45,386
Stop. Stop it.
And you stop talking in riddles.

545
00:38:45,483 --> 00:38:49,279
<i>- We won't hold him back next time.</i>
- Oh, what a threat.

546
00:38:49,386 --> 00:38:52,136
<i>I could show you where to find</i>
<i>the answer to these riddles...</i>

547
00:38:52,235 --> 00:38:54,471
<i>but I don't suppose</i>
<i>you'd believe me.</i>

548
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:05,832
Good evening, signora.

549
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:09,606
- Do you happen to know a boy called Scipio?
- What is this, some mischief?

550
00:39:09,705 --> 00:39:11,909
We were supposed
to meet him today.

551
00:39:12,009 --> 00:39:14,464
Bo, Prosper, Hornet, Riccio
and Mosca-

552
00:39:14,569 --> 00:39:17,417
- That's us. We're his friends.
<i>- Va bene.</i>

553
00:39:20,809 --> 00:39:22,816
Wait, wait!
Two of you is enough.

554
00:39:29,064 --> 00:39:31,137
Look at this, Prop.

555
00:39:43,368 --> 00:39:45,757
Prosper.

556
00:39:45,863 --> 00:39:48,100
<i>Hey, Scip!</i>

557
00:39:55,111 --> 00:39:57,053
<i>What are you still doing here?</i>

558
00:39:57,159 --> 00:39:59,941
- Don't you have a tutorial this evening?
<i>- Not for an hour.</i>

559
00:40:00,039 --> 00:40:02,046
<i>And who are these urchins?</i>

560
00:40:04,358 --> 00:40:07,457
<i>They're my friends.</i>

561
00:40:07,558 --> 00:40:09,413
<i>What did I tell you about</i>
<i>mixing with the hoi polloi?</i>

562
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:11,615
How are you going to become
officer material...

563
00:40:11,719 --> 00:40:13,725
if you insist on fraternizing
with the unwashed?

564
00:40:14,791 --> 00:40:16,830
Thank God your uncle
will be here soon.

565
00:40:19,047 --> 00:40:20,868
They're leaving anyway.

566
00:40:20,966 --> 00:40:23,421
What that your dad?
Have you got a mum as well?

567
00:40:25,541 --> 00:40:27,363
Don't look at me like that.

568
00:40:27,462 --> 00:40:30,112
<i>I was going to tell you anyway.</i>

569
00:40:30,213 --> 00:40:33,857
You could tell everybody right now.
The others are waiting outside.

570
00:40:36,837 --> 00:40:39,771
I've got my lesson now.

571
00:40:39,876 --> 00:40:41,819
But I can get away tonight.

572
00:40:41,925 --> 00:40:45,153
As for the break-in,
everything stays as planned, okay?

573
00:40:45,253 --> 00:40:47,260
Don't make me laugh.

574
00:40:47,364 --> 00:40:50,047
All that loot was taken
from this house, wasn't it?

575
00:40:50,148 --> 00:40:52,930
<i>The Thief Lord is</i>
<i>a little rich boy's game.</i>

576
00:40:55,043 --> 00:40:56,930
And we were your fools.

577
00:41:05,219 --> 00:41:07,106
See?

578
00:41:07,203 --> 00:41:09,569
- It wasn't our Scip.
- Yes, it was.

579
00:41:09,668 --> 00:41:12,286
- And his dad's a meanie.
- His what?

580
00:41:12,387 --> 00:41:14,842
- His dad.
- What are you talking about?

581
00:41:14,947 --> 00:41:16,769
Scip doesn't have a dad.

582
00:41:16,866 --> 00:41:19,136
Why don't you go
introduce yourself?

583
00:41:27,555 --> 00:41:30,140
Scipio! Scipio,
I know you're in there!

584
00:41:30,241 --> 00:41:32,379
Come out now and tell me
it's not true!

585
00:41:32,482 --> 00:41:34,936
Now open the door!
Open the door now!

586
00:41:35,041 --> 00:41:37,823
What the devil's going on?

587
00:41:37,921 --> 00:41:41,662
I don't know who you are or what business
you have with my son here...

588
00:41:41,761 --> 00:41:45,076
but if you know what's good for you,
you'll stop this infernal racket...

589
00:41:45,186 --> 00:41:48,283
and take yourself and your disgusting
little friends away from here...

590
00:41:48,384 --> 00:41:51,167
and never let me see you
around this house again!

591
00:42:07,935 --> 00:42:09,758
"Victor's word of honor-

592
00:42:09,855 --> 00:42:11,742
"The Hartliebs will not
hear a word from me...

593
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:13,661
unless I find out
about a strange break-in."

594
00:42:13,759 --> 00:42:17,020
We have to catch him again. And this time
I swear he's going in the canal...

595
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:19,029
and Scipio can go with him
for all I care.

596
00:42:19,136 --> 00:42:21,721
<i>And what does this mean?</i>
<i>"Enjoy the show"?</i>

597
00:42:21,822 --> 00:42:24,440
"Enjoy the show"?
I don't believe it!

598
00:42:24,543 --> 00:42:26,430
<i>He must've done it!</i>

599
00:42:26,526 --> 00:42:30,716
<i>Whoo-hoo!</i>
<i>Mosca Films presents...</i>

600
00:42:30,814 --> 00:42:33,912
<i>- a film by Mosca in Scratch-Vision.</i>

601
00:42:34,014 --> 00:42:37,658
<i>To the ends of the world.</i>

602
00:42:37,758 --> 00:42:40,955
<i> Wow. Mosca's dad</i>
<i>is waiting for him on an island.</i>

603
00:42:41,054 --> 00:42:42,876
<i>- Dad!</i>

604
00:42:42,974 --> 00:42:45,210
<i>Dad, I've missed you!</i>

605
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:47,578
I miss you too, Son.

606
00:42:47,678 --> 00:42:51,572
<i>Yea! I'm so glad to see you!</i>

607
00:42:51,677 --> 00:42:54,525
<i>- Yea!</i>
- Oh, that's cool.

608
00:42:54,621 --> 00:42:57,076
<i>Yea!</i>

609
00:43:01,629 --> 00:43:04,247
He fixed it. Even the curtain
and the dimmer work.

610
00:43:04,348 --> 00:43:07,031
See, I told you Victor's
our friend now.

611
00:43:07,133 --> 00:43:10,132
Okay. Your buddy fixed the projector.
Whoop-de-do.

612
00:43:10,236 --> 00:43:13,978
What about the deal with the Conte? We can't
forget that just 'cause Vic the sneak says so.

613
00:43:14,076 --> 00:43:17,174
Do any of you actually know anything
about breakin' in?

614
00:43:17,276 --> 00:43:19,479
<i>Scip's gonna be no help.</i>
<i>You know that, right?</i>

615
00:43:19,579 --> 00:43:22,394
Who cares about Scipio?
We'll do it without him.

616
00:43:22,492 --> 00:43:24,947
Look, once we got the 50,000,
we won't need anyone-

617
00:43:25,051 --> 00:43:27,026
<i>no grown-ups</i>
<i>and no phony Thief Lord.</i>

618
00:43:27,131 --> 00:43:30,001
We'll do it tonight.
The sooner the better.

619
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:31,929
What do you think?
Are you in?

620
00:43:32,027 --> 00:43:34,448
- I suppose so.
<i>- Good.</i>

621
00:43:34,555 --> 00:43:37,075
What about you, Prop?

622
00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:41,682
<i>Prop, are you in or not?</i>

623
00:43:41,787 --> 00:43:43,707
No way.

624
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:47,065
- I could open that door
with my eyes closed.

625
00:43:47,162 --> 00:43:49,943
What if they're still awake?
What do we do then?

626
00:44:32,631 --> 00:44:35,729
Jeepers, Bo!
I almost had a heart attack.

627
00:44:35,832 --> 00:44:37,806
- You forgot something really important.
- What?

628
00:44:37,911 --> 00:44:39,733
- It's under my jumper.
- What?

629
00:44:39,831 --> 00:44:41,009
Me!

630
00:44:48,758 --> 00:44:50,646
Bo.

631
00:44:56,118 --> 00:44:59,696
Mosca? Hornet? Riccio?

632
00:45:11,637 --> 00:45:13,459
- Where's Bo?
<i>- Shh.</i>

633
00:45:13,557 --> 00:45:16,174
<i>- Bring him back here right now.</i>
- Calm down.

634
00:45:16,276 --> 00:45:19,473
He snuck out and threatened to wake up the whole
square if we didn't help him over the wall.

635
00:45:19,572 --> 00:45:22,158
Here. Catch.

636
00:45:28,212 --> 00:45:30,733
I should've left you with Esther.

637
00:45:30,836 --> 00:45:33,389
- You want to go to an orphanage
or a boot camp for babies?
- Shh!

638
00:45:33,492 --> 00:45:35,434
- I'm stay-
- See what I mean?

639
00:45:35,539 --> 00:45:39,631
<i>Don't do that again, okay?</i>
<i>I almost peed my pants.</i>

640
00:46:39,504 --> 00:46:42,406
<i>What are you doing here? Get lost.</i>

641
00:46:42,513 --> 00:46:44,967
What are <i>you</i> doing here?
This is my job.

642
00:46:45,072 --> 00:46:47,373
Oh, shut up,
you lying piece of crap.

643
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:50,635
<i>This might just be one big jolly for</i>
<i>a rich boy like you, but we need the money.</i>

644
00:46:50,735 --> 00:46:53,638
Stop it. Have you forgotten
where we are?

645
00:46:53,743 --> 00:46:56,972
And you can't take anything to the Conte,
you fibbing, lying rat lord.

646
00:46:57,071 --> 00:47:00,235
<i>Not even a message,</i>
<i>'cause we've got Sofia. So there!</i>

647
00:47:00,336 --> 00:47:02,190
<i>Come on, you lot.</i>
<i>We've got to find the wing.</i>

648
00:47:02,287 --> 00:47:05,003
Prosper, me and you take the left.
Riccio and Hornet, you go right.

649
00:47:05,103 --> 00:47:08,878
<i>Yeah, and you, pants on fire,</i>
<i>just stay out of our way.</i>

650
00:47:12,238 --> 00:47:14,660
You better go home, Scipio.

651
00:47:14,766 --> 00:47:16,969
<i>The others are really angry.</i>

652
00:47:17,070 --> 00:47:19,459
They don't understand
what you've done.

653
00:47:19,565 --> 00:47:21,932
Are you angry?

654
00:47:22,029 --> 00:47:24,102
Do you understand?

655
00:47:32,045 --> 00:47:34,118
I'm trying.

656
00:47:37,422 --> 00:47:39,309
What is this?

657
00:47:46,508 --> 00:47:48,581
Wow.

658
00:48:03,979 --> 00:48:06,051
- Look.
- What's the matter?

659
00:48:06,156 --> 00:48:08,489
<i>- The pictures.</i>
- Whoa.

660
00:48:08,587 --> 00:48:12,963
<i>The wing's not in the living room.</i>
<i>What's up?</i>

661
00:48:13,067 --> 00:48:14,561
- Scip's just gone upstairs.
- What?

662
00:48:14,668 --> 00:48:16,642
<i>- Prop.</i>
- Oh, my God.

663
00:48:16,746 --> 00:48:19,746
<i>- Upstairs? Oh, no!</i>
<i>- Everybody just calm down for a minute.</i>

664
00:48:19,851 --> 00:48:24,041
So, for once I decide to go out at night,
and what do I find when I get back?

665
00:48:24,138 --> 00:48:26,724
A bunch of little cat burglars
creeping around in my house.

666
00:48:26,826 --> 00:48:29,509
Please don't shoot.

667
00:48:29,610 --> 00:48:32,327
Oh. So look who it is.

668
00:48:33,450 --> 00:48:35,905
It's the rude little boy
from the kiosk...

669
00:48:36,010 --> 00:48:38,311
<i>and the little girl</i>-

670
00:48:39,433 --> 00:48:43,044
oh, and the poor orphan boy.

671
00:48:43,145 --> 00:48:45,863
- What are you after, my cameras?
- Please, don't call the police.

672
00:48:45,961 --> 00:48:48,416
<i>Oh, I think that'll be</i>
<i>the very least I will do.</i>

673
00:48:48,522 --> 00:48:51,717
You have a right to be angry, but we're not
after your cameras. We only want the wing.

674
00:48:53,513 --> 00:48:56,001
The wing?

675
00:48:56,104 --> 00:48:58,526
<i>Really?</i>

676
00:48:59,625 --> 00:49:01,664
What do you know
about my wing?

677
00:49:01,767 --> 00:49:03,590
<i>Oh!</i>

678
00:49:03,688 --> 00:49:06,721
- And how old are you?
- Six and a quarter.

679
00:49:06,823 --> 00:49:10,238
- <i>Madonna.</i>
- He's my little brother. He doesn't know better.

680
00:49:10,345 --> 00:49:12,351
<i>Why have you got pictures of him?</i>

681
00:49:12,456 --> 00:49:15,303
- Why have you got pictures of him?
- I'm a photographer.

682
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:18,880
I- I take pictures of kids on the street.
That's why.

683
00:49:18,984 --> 00:49:22,758
- Where do you live?
- We haven't got proper homes.

684
00:49:24,327 --> 00:49:27,643
<i>Well, I'm sorry</i>
<i>to hear that, if it's true.</i>

685
00:49:29,031 --> 00:49:32,064
Now, what do you want
with my wing?

686
00:49:32,166 --> 00:49:34,338
Someone asked us to steal it.

687
00:49:34,439 --> 00:49:36,643
Asked you?

688
00:49:36,742 --> 00:49:40,965
- Who?
- My client wishes to maintain
the upmost confidentiality.

689
00:49:41,062 --> 00:49:42,950
Scipio, put the gun down.

690
00:49:43,045 --> 00:49:45,980
I found the wing.
It was in her room.

691
00:49:46,086 --> 00:49:47,908
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

692
00:49:48,005 --> 00:49:49,947
Oh, just give it to me!

693
00:49:51,014 --> 00:49:53,599
It doesn't work anyway.

694
00:49:53,701 --> 00:49:56,963
<i>And that, I presume,</i>
<i>is my wing?</i>

695
00:49:57,061 --> 00:49:59,101
You know, I'm- I'm curious.

696
00:49:59,205 --> 00:50:03,035
Just how much does this mystery employer
offer to pay you for it?

697
00:50:04,549 --> 00:50:06,883
50,000.

698
00:50:08,645 --> 00:50:11,231
50,000?

699
00:50:11,333 --> 00:50:13,155
That's rather a lot.

700
00:50:13,253 --> 00:50:15,358
Not for us, 'cause we have
to pay for everything...

701
00:50:15,461 --> 00:50:18,973
<i>'cause we don't have parents or anything,</i>
<i>and we have to leave the star lair...</i>

702
00:50:19,076 --> 00:50:22,305
and Mosca's boat needs painting,
and Riccio needs new teeth...

703
00:50:22,403 --> 00:50:26,145
<i>and Hornet needs new clothes, and</i>-
<i>I'm worried it's not enough actually.</i>

704
00:50:27,652 --> 00:50:29,539
It's beautiful.

705
00:50:31,107 --> 00:50:32,994
It's an angel's wing,
isn't it?

706
00:50:33,092 --> 00:50:35,131
An angel's? Oh, no.

707
00:50:35,235 --> 00:50:37,122
It's a lion's wing.

708
00:50:37,218 --> 00:50:39,585
I told you so,
but no one listens to me.

709
00:50:39,682 --> 00:50:42,944
I was given it, when I left the orphanage.

710
00:50:44,738 --> 00:50:46,560
Are you an orphan?

711
00:50:46,658 --> 00:50:48,894
Yes.

712
00:50:48,994 --> 00:50:51,296
I lived there
for more than 10 years.

713
00:50:51,394 --> 00:50:52,492
What makes the wing
worth so much?

714
00:50:52,527 --> 00:50:53,591
What makes the wing
worth so much?

715
00:50:55,266 --> 00:50:57,305
Do you know
I really don't know?

716
00:50:59,233 --> 00:51:02,233
But I think
it's time we found out.

717
00:51:02,337 --> 00:51:04,541
Mother Superior sent me here...

718
00:51:04,641 --> 00:51:07,608
because I tried
to find out the truth.

719
00:51:07,713 --> 00:51:11,358
<i>Over 150 years ago...</i>

720
00:51:11,457 --> 00:51:15,385
a rich merchant gave the merry-go-round
to the orphanage.

721
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:18,555
But before the children
could ever enjoy it...

722
00:51:18,656 --> 00:51:21,023
it disappeared.

723
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:23,291
All they ever found
was a fragment.

724
00:51:23,392 --> 00:51:25,759
The wing!

725
00:51:27,775 --> 00:51:29,662
I found it-

726
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:32,825
<i>In the attic</i>
<i>of the orphanage...</i>

727
00:51:32,928 --> 00:51:34,903
and I gave it to Ida...

728
00:51:35,007 --> 00:51:37,528
to keep safe.

729
00:51:43,935 --> 00:51:47,034
<i>I never saw</i>
<i>the merry-go-round...</i>

730
00:51:47,134 --> 00:51:49,501
but it was said to be-

731
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:52,348
Unique.

732
00:51:52,446 --> 00:51:55,545
- It had five wooden figures on it.
- Yes, I know- the mermaid...

733
00:51:55,646 --> 00:51:57,533
<i>the "man-maid" with the big fork...</i>

734
00:51:57,631 --> 00:51:59,703
<i>the sea horse</i>
<i>from the fountain...</i>

735
00:51:59,807 --> 00:52:02,654
the flying lion
and the uni- um-whatsit.

736
00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:05,116
The unicorn?

737
00:52:08,286 --> 00:52:10,108
<i>Yes, like that one.</i>

738
00:52:17,725 --> 00:52:19,929
- Bo, how do you know all this?
- Mum told me.

739
00:52:20,029 --> 00:52:23,095
<i>Sister, what makes</i>
<i>the merry-go-round so special?</i>

740
00:52:23,197 --> 00:52:26,994
- It had magical powers.
- What did it do?

741
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:30,777
A child could go
round and round and round.

742
00:52:30,877 --> 00:52:33,365
<i>It became a grown-up.</i>

743
00:52:33,468 --> 00:52:35,988
A grown-up could go
round and round and round-

744
00:52:36,092 --> 00:52:38,742
<i>And become a child.</i>

745
00:52:38,844 --> 00:52:42,706
<i>Sister, please tell me,</i>
<i>is that really true?</i>

746
00:52:42,811 --> 00:52:45,267
Of course.

747
00:52:45,372 --> 00:52:48,950
My great-great-grandmother saw it.

748
00:52:51,547 --> 00:52:55,824
The Conte must know where the merry-go-round
is now. It doesn't make sense otherwise.

749
00:52:55,932 --> 00:53:00,404
You know, I bet he believes that if he
reattaches the wing, it really will work.

750
00:53:00,507 --> 00:53:02,394
Work, like the sister said?

751
00:53:02,491 --> 00:53:04,466
If it really works,
I swear I'll find it.

752
00:53:04,571 --> 00:53:08,597
I'll find it, ride on it, and I'll only
get off when I'm taller than my father.

753
00:53:09,754 --> 00:53:12,536
I tell you what.
I'll let you have the wing.

754
00:53:12,634 --> 00:53:15,089
You take it to the Conte,
and you get your reward...

755
00:53:15,193 --> 00:53:17,016
<i>but I want to go with you.</i>

756
00:53:17,114 --> 00:53:19,928
<i>We follow the Conte,</i>
<i>and he will lead us to the merry-go-round.</i>

757
00:53:20,026 --> 00:53:22,393
- We'll do what Ida says.
- Who asked you?

758
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:25,523
- Go home, Thief Lord, back to
that posh house you live in.
- Hey!

759
00:53:25,626 --> 00:53:27,993
<i>Fighting isn't</i>
<i>what we need right now.</i>

760
00:53:28,089 --> 00:53:31,351
<i>I'm as cross with him as you are,</i>
<i>but this time he's right.</i>

761
00:53:34,201 --> 00:53:37,845
I know it's true,
'cause I've seen all the animals now.

762
00:53:39,544 --> 00:53:41,878
I'm afraid it's just a fairy tale, Bo.

763
00:53:41,976 --> 00:53:44,180
No, it's not. I promise.

764
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:48,887
Wouldn't it be good
if it was true?

765
00:53:48,984 --> 00:53:50,872
Think what we could do.

766
00:54:04,983 --> 00:54:08,496
This is your big moment, Sofia, so don't screw up.

767
00:54:17,527 --> 00:54:19,894
<i>The boys are definitely</i>
<i>no longer in Venice.</i>

768
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:21,812
I am convinced of it.

769
00:54:21,910 --> 00:54:24,332
I'm total- utterly convinced
the boys are no longer in Venice.

770
00:54:24,438 --> 00:54:26,577
But where have they gone?

771
00:54:26,678 --> 00:54:29,395
Corfu.

772
00:54:29,494 --> 00:54:33,040
Corf- Corfu?

773
00:54:33,142 --> 00:54:36,687
But that's impossible.
Why on earth would they go to Corfu?

774
00:54:36,789 --> 00:54:39,855
Well, they probably knew
that I was onto them.

775
00:54:39,958 --> 00:54:43,667
Oh, no, no, no, no. I'm quite sure
that they are still here.

776
00:54:43,764 --> 00:54:46,001
<i>Now, I have had posters printed...</i>

777
00:54:46,101 --> 00:54:48,337
with Boniface's photo
on them, which you-

778
00:54:48,437 --> 00:54:52,528
Something you could've done,
had you shown any initiative.

779
00:54:52,629 --> 00:54:55,050
If you continue to display
such incompetence...

780
00:54:55,157 --> 00:54:58,320
I'll have no choice but to
take matters into my own hands.

781
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:08,366
<i> Get your grubby hands off!</i>
<i>That's a valuable piece!</i>

782
00:55:11,955 --> 00:55:13,842
Here.

783
00:55:14,995 --> 00:55:17,199
Have a little sweetie.

784
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:20,812
Keep you still.

785
00:55:20,915 --> 00:55:25,584
Now, you can trust your friend,
Ernesto Barbarossa...

786
00:55:25,683 --> 00:55:27,505
with a little secret.

787
00:55:27,603 --> 00:55:30,090
What did your master
steal for the Conte?

788
00:55:30,194 --> 00:55:32,169
We may be young,
but we're not completely stupid.

789
00:55:32,274 --> 00:55:35,372
<i>Give that back before I tear</i>
<i>your nasty little tongue out!</i>

790
00:55:35,474 --> 00:55:37,579
You-

791
00:55:37,682 --> 00:55:41,479
You can keep it,
because you shouted at Prosper.

792
00:55:41,586 --> 00:55:44,455
Anyway, it was yucky.

793
00:55:47,857 --> 00:55:49,996
"Meet me on
the Sacca della Misericordia.

794
00:55:50,097 --> 00:55:52,202
Look out for a red lantern.
Tonight, 1:00 a.m."

795
00:55:52,305 --> 00:55:53,647
Tonight?

796
00:55:57,649 --> 00:56:00,998
<i>Well, how are you planning to get across</i>
<i>the lagoon in that tub, anyway?</i>

797
00:56:01,105 --> 00:56:03,112
Who said anything about the lagoon?

798
00:56:03,216 --> 00:56:07,373
Well, you don't think the Conte could keep
the merry-go-round secret in the city, do you?

799
00:56:07,472 --> 00:56:09,295
And another thing.
He's not gonna be too happy...

800
00:56:09,393 --> 00:56:11,726
to find the rightful owner
of the wing in on the deal.

801
00:56:11,824 --> 00:56:13,646
<i>Scipio'd better steer.</i>

802
00:56:13,744 --> 00:56:16,046
He knows all about boat trips.

803
00:56:16,144 --> 00:56:18,599
All right. I'll make myself
invisible for a while.

804
00:56:38,606 --> 00:56:42,184
<i>Soon, my beloved sister.</i>

805
00:56:42,286 --> 00:56:45,603
Soon, our years of patience
will earn their reward.

806
00:56:47,310 --> 00:56:51,565
<i>Time our foolish young delivery boy</i>
<i>kept his appointment.</i>

807
00:57:02,734 --> 00:57:04,838
<i>Salve,</i> Thief Lord.

808
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:09,032
<i>I presume youre just as cold as we are...</i>

809
00:57:09,132 --> 00:57:12,810
so let's complete this transaction
as quickly as possible.

810
00:57:34,379 --> 00:57:38,634
Well, what on earth is that?

811
00:57:38,731 --> 00:57:41,000
Here.

812
00:57:41,098 --> 00:57:44,874
<i>If I were you, I would use the money</i>
<i>to find myself another occupation.</i>

813
00:57:44,971 --> 00:57:49,095
<i>How old are you, 14? 15?</i>

814
00:57:49,195 --> 00:57:51,878
With this money,
I can be any age I want.

815
00:57:51,978 --> 00:57:55,361
<i>- I won't have to be a child any longer.</i>
- Did you hear that, Renzo?

816
00:57:56,362 --> 00:57:59,264
He no longer wants to be a child!

817
00:57:59,370 --> 00:58:02,948
Nature will soon grant him his wish.

818
00:58:06,057 --> 00:58:09,353
Don't you want to count the money,
Thief Lord?

819
00:58:17,225 --> 00:58:19,396
Holy moly!

820
00:58:19,497 --> 00:58:23,358
<i>Uh, how much does it cost</i>
<i>to go to the dentist?</i>

821
00:58:28,904 --> 00:58:30,846
Looks like
it's all here.

822
00:58:30,952 --> 00:58:33,091
<i>I believe you to be</i>
<i>a man of your word.</i>

823
00:58:34,152 --> 00:58:37,599
<i>Safe return,</i>
<i>Thief Lord.</i>

824
00:58:44,551 --> 00:58:47,201
Thief Lord, hedgehog boy...

825
00:58:47,304 --> 00:58:50,881
<i>money boy, boat boy.</i>

826
00:58:50,983 --> 00:58:54,779
<i>I wonder where my walking,</i>
<i>talking little reward is?</i>

827
00:58:55,783 --> 00:58:58,913
<i>Turn on the lights!</i>

828
00:58:59,014 --> 00:59:01,949
There they are, the little pests!

829
00:59:02,054 --> 00:59:03,810
- It's the police!
<i>- Where's Prop?</i>

830
00:59:03,910 --> 00:59:07,205
- Get them! Get them!
- Hurry, quick! They're not back yet! Come on.

831
00:59:08,487 --> 00:59:10,374
Stop running!

832
00:59:12,070 --> 00:59:14,044
Stop running!

833
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:17,020
- We're not gonna harm you!
- Come on, Bo. Through here.

834
00:59:17,126 --> 00:59:19,428
Stop!

835
00:59:19,525 --> 00:59:22,242
Can't get away, kids!
Stop!

836
00:59:22,342 --> 00:59:23,967
- Go on! Run!
- Come here! Come here!

837
00:59:24,069 --> 00:59:26,916
- Watch out!
- No!

838
00:59:30,597 --> 00:59:33,018
<i>Well, well, well. Look who it is.</i>

839
00:59:34,372 --> 00:59:37,634
Did you really think
you were going to get away?

840
00:59:37,732 --> 00:59:40,099
Running never helps.

841
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:43,642
Ka-ching!

842
00:59:57,219 --> 00:59:59,042
How far's
the Conte gonna sail?

843
00:59:59,139 --> 01:00:01,473
If we go on like this,
we'll be as stiff as frozen chickens.

844
01:00:05,028 --> 01:00:07,361
<i>Oh, my God. I know where this is.</i>

845
01:00:07,459 --> 01:00:09,347
Don't go any further.
Turn off the engine.

846
01:00:10,498 --> 01:00:13,466
Isola Segreta.

847
01:00:13,571 --> 01:00:16,254
<i>The secret isle.</i>

848
01:00:16,354 --> 01:00:20,128
<i>I thought it was deserted,</i>
<i>but it seems I'm wrong.</i>

849
01:00:20,227 --> 01:00:24,601
Isola Segreta?
Isn't that the island where nobody goes?

850
01:00:24,706 --> 01:00:28,055
<i>They say it's haunted.</i>

851
01:00:28,162 --> 01:00:30,780
And that anyone who
sets foot on the island never returns.

852
01:00:30,881 --> 01:00:34,264
I've had it. Let's go.
I'm not going near no haunted island.

853
01:00:34,369 --> 01:00:36,703
Deal off. Time to get
our money home.

854
01:00:36,801 --> 01:00:40,511
Wait. Look. They're looking this way.

855
01:00:40,609 --> 01:00:42,431
Renzo! Can you see anything?

856
01:00:42,528 --> 01:00:46,751
There's nothing there! They're just
nervous! They know what we're doing!

857
01:00:46,849 --> 01:00:48,954
Oh, my God. I think
the woman's got a gun!

858
01:00:49,057 --> 01:00:50,463
<i>- Go away!</i>
- Heads down!

859
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:54,138
- Get away from here!
- Don't you know this is private property?

860
01:00:54,241 --> 01:00:56,859
<i>Keep your heads down!</i>

861
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:00,473
<i>Don't come back!</i>

862
01:01:02,783 --> 01:01:07,191
Is everyone all right? I am so sorry
I dragged you into this madness.

863
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:13,560
Well, at least we've got the money.

864
01:01:13,663 --> 01:01:16,827
It's there, Prop.
It has to be on that island.

865
01:01:22,654 --> 01:01:25,621
- What have the police been doing here?
- How should I know?

866
01:01:25,726 --> 01:01:28,540
Shut up. Come on.

867
01:01:28,639 --> 01:01:32,021
Bo! Hornet!
Where are you?

868
01:01:32,127 --> 01:01:34,231
I knew it! Why didn't you listen to me?

869
01:01:34,334 --> 01:01:36,155
It's the snooper!
He's conned us!

870
01:01:36,254 --> 01:01:38,840
Stupid word of honor!
I could puke!

871
01:01:41,630 --> 01:01:44,596
Hold on, slugger!
Calm down! Put that away, okay?

872
01:01:46,236 --> 01:01:49,619
I'll go ask him. See if he'd rather
tell us or have his face smashed in!

873
01:01:55,965 --> 01:02:00,023
<i>Ah, gentlemen, the matter seems</i>
<i>to have resolved itself.</i>

874
01:02:00,125 --> 01:02:03,540
<i>- My son has decided to come home after all.</i>
<i>- Do you know this boy?</i>

875
01:02:03,644 --> 01:02:07,507
All right. Just let me go.
I can walk by myself.

876
01:02:08,860 --> 01:02:10,769
Bo is with his aunt.

877
01:02:14,075 --> 01:02:16,660
If I find you had something
to do with this incident at the Stella...

878
01:02:16,764 --> 01:02:20,821
I swear to God, you will regret
the day you were born.

879
01:02:40,635 --> 01:02:43,831
- Where's my brother? And where's Hornet?
- Go on. Tell him.

880
01:02:43,931 --> 01:02:46,418
Somebody kindly tell me
what all this rumpus is about.

881
01:02:46,522 --> 01:02:50,548
Bo and Hornet have disappeared, and Prosper
thinks that you ratted on us. So does Riccio!

882
01:02:50,650 --> 01:02:53,072
What a load of cobblers.
Number one, I haven't ratted on anyone.

883
01:02:53,177 --> 01:02:56,308
Number two, I haven't
been to the Stella since I escaped.

884
01:02:56,409 --> 01:02:59,704
And number three, I told the Hartliebs
that you'd left Venice.

885
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:05,300
So, don't you think it's time to decide
if I'm your friend... or your enemy?

886
01:03:05,401 --> 01:03:08,979
<i>... in its rich history.</i>
<i>It is many times more magnificent</i>-

887
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:12,496
Now, I think we'd better go inside
before we become a tourist attraction.

888
01:03:20,472 --> 01:03:23,952
Ooh!

889
01:03:24,055 --> 01:03:27,371
So, Ida let you run through
the city with this lot?

890
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:29,782
Means you got some nerve,
I must say.

891
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:33,142
Hang on.

892
01:03:34,711 --> 01:03:36,685
Somebody's ripped you off.

893
01:03:36,790 --> 01:03:39,092
This money's not real.

894
01:03:40,631 --> 01:03:43,729
- Fake money?
- I'm afraid so.

895
01:03:43,831 --> 01:03:46,252
- All of it.
- What a waste!

896
01:03:46,359 --> 01:03:50,515
The break-in, the lagoon!
We nearly get shot, and what do we get?

897
01:03:50,615 --> 01:03:52,524
<i>A pile of funny money!</i>

898
01:04:02,038 --> 01:04:04,209
What about Bo?

899
01:04:07,317 --> 01:04:11,693
I'm sorry, Proper. I'll do
everything I can to help get him back.

900
01:04:17,908 --> 01:04:19,730
Hello?

901
01:04:19,828 --> 01:04:23,473
Uh, good morning,
Mrs. Hartlieb. It's Victor Getz.

902
01:04:23,572 --> 01:04:25,906
- I just wanted to-
- How dare you call me at this hour?

903
01:04:26,004 --> 01:04:29,167
Your <i>case</i> has resolved itself.

904
01:04:29,268 --> 01:04:32,465
<i>We have captured our nephew,</i>
<i>no thanks to you.</i>

905
01:04:32,563 --> 01:04:37,614
<i>Apparently he was hiding in some derelict</i>
<i>cinema with some girl who wouldn't give a name.</i>

906
01:04:37,715 --> 01:04:40,497
<i>The police are taking care of her.</i>

907
01:04:40,595 --> 01:04:42,504
<i>Now, will you kindly</i>
<i>not disturb us again?</i>

908
01:05:04,306 --> 01:05:06,280
You look so smart
in your new suit.

909
01:05:06,386 --> 01:05:08,426
<i> It's all right.</i>
<i>Have a taste. It's all for you.</i>

910
01:05:08,529 --> 01:05:10,668
I hate it, and I hate you.

911
01:05:15,505 --> 01:05:18,407
<i> What on earth do you think</i>
<i>you're doing, you ungrateful little monkey?</i>

912
01:05:22,610 --> 01:05:26,221
Morning.
We're here to see Ida Spavento.

913
01:05:26,321 --> 01:05:28,360
Oh. Don't I know you?

914
01:05:28,464 --> 01:05:30,668
<i> Uh-huh. Yes, you do.</i>
<i>We're staying this time.</i>

915
01:05:30,768 --> 01:05:33,768
Vic-Victor, what on-
What on earth is going on?

916
01:05:33,873 --> 01:05:36,939
I was gonna ask you the same thing.

917
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:39,942
And to make things even worse,
the Conte gave us fake money.

918
01:05:40,048 --> 01:05:43,496
- No.
- These kids are in enough trouble as it is, Ida.

919
01:05:43,599 --> 01:05:46,087
<i>- You- You really haven't helped.</i>
- Shut up, Victor!

920
01:05:46,191 --> 01:05:50,185
Well, I guess I'm
the one in trouble now.

921
01:05:50,287 --> 01:05:52,840
Well, I'm sure we'll figure
something out. Damn it, Ida.

922
01:05:52,942 --> 01:05:55,790
What were you thinking, taking these kids
on one of your crazy adventures?

923
01:05:55,887 --> 01:06:00,393
Oh, and what would you have done?
Lock them all up in an orphanage again?

924
01:06:00,495 --> 01:06:04,324
Talking of which, they probably
took Hornet to the Merciful Sisters.

925
01:06:05,999 --> 01:06:07,821
Does anyone know her real name?

926
01:06:07,918 --> 01:06:09,926
<i>Katarina?</i>

927
01:06:10,030 --> 01:06:12,780
<i>Aha, so that</i> is <i>your name.</i>

928
01:06:12,878 --> 01:06:14,602
Come with me.
You have visitors.

929
01:06:14,702 --> 01:06:17,550
- Who is it?
<i>- Your godmother.</i>

930
01:06:21,966 --> 01:06:25,446
<i>There she is.</i>
<i>Come here. Oh.</i>

931
01:06:29,069 --> 01:06:32,898
<i>Sweetheart.</i>

932
01:06:36,557 --> 01:06:39,426
Come on, Prop.
You can't wait out here all night.

933
01:06:40,908 --> 01:06:44,651
- Bo's inside there. I know it.
- Bo's not going anywhere tonight.

934
01:06:44,749 --> 01:06:47,236
As long as he's
in the hotel, he's safe.

935
01:06:48,300 --> 01:06:51,399
Anyway, Hornet
can't wait to see you.

936
01:06:52,940 --> 01:06:55,690
Do you know what?
I reckon she's got a crush on you.

937
01:07:19,307 --> 01:07:21,129
Wake up.

938
01:07:21,226 --> 01:07:23,113
<i>How did you know</i>
<i>we were at Ida's?</i>

939
01:07:23,210 --> 01:07:25,730
How quickly you forget
how I can ghost through the city...

940
01:07:25,834 --> 01:07:28,518
tracking whom I please.

941
01:07:28,618 --> 01:07:33,091
They took Bo away from you
because you're not grown-up like them.

942
01:07:33,193 --> 01:07:35,015
There's only one thing for it, Prop.

943
01:07:35,113 --> 01:07:39,652
We have to go back to the island
and both take the ride of a lifetime.

944
01:08:30,343 --> 01:08:32,993
<i>Come on, dear.</i>

945
01:08:33,095 --> 01:08:35,964
What do you expect in this place?
What is there to say?

946
01:08:36,071 --> 01:08:39,037
- What did you think of the wine?
<i>- Oh, don't.</i>

947
01:08:39,142 --> 01:08:40,800
<i>- Warm white wine.</i>
- Bo?

948
01:08:40,902 --> 01:08:45,157
<i>- Warm white wine.</i>
<i>- I mean, warm white wine!</i>

949
01:08:45,253 --> 01:08:47,076
<i>You'd think they'd know.</i>

950
01:08:49,189 --> 01:08:51,938
<i>But what about the soggy spaghetti?</i>

951
01:08:52,037 --> 01:08:54,557
<i>- Did you get cheese</i>
<i>with that fish sauce?</i>
- No.

952
01:08:54,662 --> 01:08:57,149
<i>- Did you? No.</i>
<i>- No.</i>

953
01:09:05,061 --> 01:09:07,363
<i> Gone? What do you mean, gone?</i>
<i>Where's he gone?</i>

954
01:09:07,460 --> 01:09:09,598
<i>- Out of the window?</i>
<i>- I looked everywhere else.</i>

955
01:09:09,700 --> 01:09:12,667
Oh, he went out of the window, did he?
Oh, really?

956
01:09:12,772 --> 01:09:14,844
- How can he possibly have got out the window?
- Look, look.

957
01:09:14,948 --> 01:09:17,249
- Down there? Look at the drop, you fool!
- It wasn't me.

958
01:09:17,348 --> 01:09:19,171
Yes?

959
01:09:19,268 --> 01:09:21,406
Mr. Getz?

960
01:09:21,507 --> 01:09:25,697
Is there a chance, Mr. Getz, that you will
perform any useful service in our employ?

961
01:09:25,794 --> 01:09:28,129
Or are you too busy
feeding your tortoises?

962
01:09:28,227 --> 01:09:31,129
Oh, uh, I beg your pardon.
I thought I'd been fired.

963
01:09:31,235 --> 01:09:34,748
Boniface has run away again,
selfish little imp!

964
01:09:34,850 --> 01:09:40,065
Now, we expect him back here,
with us, by the morning!

965
01:09:40,162 --> 01:09:41,985
When did he run away?

966
01:09:42,083 --> 01:09:44,253
Is anyone looking for him?
Your husband or the police?

967
01:09:44,354 --> 01:09:47,518
- Oh!
- Give it here.

968
01:09:47,618 --> 01:09:52,255
Listen here, Getz. Fortunately for you,
my wife is a patient woman.

969
01:09:52,354 --> 01:09:56,893
This case will be resolved immediately,
if I have to do it myself.

970
01:09:56,993 --> 01:09:58,816
Is that clear enough for you?

971
01:10:15,841 --> 01:10:18,874
See? Like I thought.
No dogs at the back.

972
01:10:31,168 --> 01:10:33,077
- What's the matter?
- I'm scared.

973
01:10:33,184 --> 01:10:36,413
- Of what?
- They have guns.

974
01:10:44,127 --> 01:10:46,975
Bo?

975
01:10:48,478 --> 01:10:52,254
- Bo! It's me, Victor.
<i>- I'm not going back to Esther.</i>

976
01:10:52,350 --> 01:10:54,870
Well, good. Because we're not
planning to let her have you.

977
01:10:54,974 --> 01:10:57,559
<i>- Really?</i>
- Yeah, not even the tiniest little piece of you.

978
01:10:57,662 --> 01:11:00,564
- Where are you?
<i>- Up here.</i>

979
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:04,346
They're all gone.

980
01:11:05,630 --> 01:11:08,564
- And my kittens.
- They're-

981
01:11:08,669 --> 01:11:11,036
They're all tucked up
safe and sound at Ida's house.

982
01:11:11,134 --> 01:11:12,922
Esther said Prosper was bad.

983
01:11:13,021 --> 01:11:16,250
No. Let me tell you one thing.

984
01:11:17,438 --> 01:11:21,398
Prosper is the best brother
anyone could have.

985
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:23,388
Come on.
I'll catch you.

986
01:11:36,603 --> 01:11:39,800
I bet that big brother of yours
is worried sick about you.

987
01:11:39,899 --> 01:11:42,933
But at least
he's in a nice, soft bed.

988
01:11:55,291 --> 01:11:58,487
Don't move. If we run, they'll take us down.

989
01:11:58,586 --> 01:12:02,034
Bimba! Bella!
Enough!

990
01:12:05,466 --> 01:12:08,248
<i>- What are you doing here?</i>
- We want to see the Conte.

991
01:12:08,346 --> 01:12:11,128
The Conte doesn't like
unannounced visitors.

992
01:12:11,226 --> 01:12:15,382
We had a deal with him,
and he cheated us.

993
01:12:17,402 --> 01:12:19,442
That way. And don't try to run.

994
01:12:19,545 --> 01:12:21,585
My dogs are faster than you.

995
01:12:30,329 --> 01:12:32,238
<i>Bella.</i>

996
01:12:32,344 --> 01:12:35,411
Renzo, the Thief Lord has come to pay you a visit.

997
01:12:35,512 --> 01:12:39,342
Something about fake money
and a merry-go-round.

998
01:12:39,449 --> 01:12:41,271
I think it would be
a capital idea...

999
01:12:41,369 --> 01:12:43,922
to feed him and his
little friend to the dogs.

1000
01:12:44,024 --> 01:12:46,326
I apologize for
my sister's rudeness.

1001
01:12:46,424 --> 01:12:50,001
<i>So you found out about the money?</i>
<i>My apologies.</i>

1002
01:12:50,104 --> 01:12:52,047
It was Barbarossa's idea.

1003
01:12:52,152 --> 01:12:54,519
I wouldn't have been able to pay you otherwise.

1004
01:12:54,616 --> 01:12:58,096
I knew it.
The merry-go-round works.

1005
01:13:00,119 --> 01:13:01,907
<i>You're the Conte.</i>

1006
01:13:02,007 --> 01:13:06,350
<i>At your service, Thief Lord.</i>

1007
01:13:06,455 --> 01:13:10,678
Does anyone know you're here?

1008
01:13:10,775 --> 01:13:12,913
Our friends know.
And a detective too.

1009
01:13:13,014 --> 01:13:16,178
We will settle everything
to your full satisfaction.

1010
01:13:16,278 --> 01:13:18,645
We pay you with a ride
on the merry-go-round.

1011
01:13:18,742 --> 01:13:22,539
<i>- That is what you are here for, is it not?</i>
- It is indeed.

1012
01:13:22,647 --> 01:13:27,381
Just be aware that this is
no simple fairground attraction.

1013
01:13:27,478 --> 01:13:30,161
To ride one of the creatures...

1014
01:13:30,262 --> 01:13:34,255
is to ride
into the teeth of peril.

1015
01:13:34,358 --> 01:13:36,626
I only just managed
to dismount in time.

1016
01:13:36,726 --> 01:13:39,856
Uh, looks like
you went a bit too far.

1017
01:13:39,957 --> 01:13:42,030
<i>We were never allowed</i>
<i>a real childhood...</i>

1018
01:13:42,133 --> 01:13:44,337
in which to play
and grow up together.

1019
01:13:44,437 --> 01:13:47,055
How could you possibly
want to turn yourselves into children?

1020
01:13:47,156 --> 01:13:49,294
Prosper and I want to
ride the merry-go-round forward.

1021
01:13:49,397 --> 01:13:51,982
<i>Va bene.</i>
If that is your wish.

1022
01:13:55,060 --> 01:13:58,159
- I'll go and check on them.
- Are you expecting visitors?

1023
01:13:59,252 --> 01:14:01,357
No one dares to set foot
on this island.

1024
01:14:01,460 --> 01:14:03,980
The only visitor we allowed to
come here was Barbarossa.

1025
01:14:04,083 --> 01:14:07,182
<i>- Does he know</i>
<i>about that merry-go-round?</i>
- Good heavens, no.

1026
01:14:07,284 --> 01:14:10,414
He'd immediately start selling tickets
at 10,000 apiece.

1027
01:14:16,691 --> 01:14:19,690
Can't wait to see Prosper's face
when he sees you safe and sound.

1028
01:14:19,794 --> 01:14:24,104
But what if he rode the merry-go-round
and is now all old like you?

1029
01:14:24,211 --> 01:14:26,796
I don't know what funny stories
you've been listening to.

1030
01:14:34,961 --> 01:14:38,606
Wow! Look at it, Prop.
It's incredible.

1031
01:14:40,050 --> 01:14:42,189
This is the solution
to all our problems.

1032
01:14:42,289 --> 01:14:44,940
Problems just don't disappear
because you get older.

1033
01:14:45,041 --> 01:14:47,213
That's the point.
You'll be a man...

1034
01:14:47,313 --> 01:14:50,445
free to overcome them
in any way you want.

1035
01:14:50,545 --> 01:14:52,367
Does it matter
which one we ride?

1036
01:14:52,465 --> 01:14:54,669
The lion was the right mount
for me, but to grow older...

1037
01:14:54,769 --> 01:14:57,289
you two must choose
one of the water creatures.

1038
01:14:57,392 --> 01:14:59,214
Come on, Prop.
Take a pick.

1039
01:14:59,312 --> 01:15:02,378
Which one do you want?
The sea horse or the merman?

1040
01:15:04,336 --> 01:15:08,493
What you do is your choice,
but I can't do this.

1041
01:15:10,576 --> 01:15:14,187
What about Bo?
Think how happy he would be.

1042
01:15:14,288 --> 01:15:18,029
Bo wants me as a brother,
not a father.

1043
01:15:23,695 --> 01:15:25,932
You heard him, Conte.
Looks like I'm riding solo.

1044
01:15:26,031 --> 01:15:27,853
<i>So let's do it.</i>

1045
01:15:32,655 --> 01:15:35,589
- Come on. Let's go!
<i>- Are you quite sure you</i>
<i>want to go through with this?</i>

1046
01:15:35,694 --> 01:15:37,637
I've never been more sure
of anything in my life.

1047
01:15:37,743 --> 01:15:40,132
And I swear I won't come off
till I need a shave.

1048
01:15:40,238 --> 01:15:42,060
Hold on tight.

1049
01:15:56,845 --> 01:15:58,755
Here we go!

1050
01:16:14,508 --> 01:16:16,777
<i>Roll on the good times!</i>

1051
01:16:16,876 --> 01:16:19,364
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!
Whoo-hoo!

1052
01:16:22,668 --> 01:16:24,456
<i>Yeah!</i>

1053
01:17:01,514 --> 01:17:04,197
Make him get off
or he'll be an old man!

1054
01:17:05,193 --> 01:17:07,081
Scip! Get off!

1055
01:17:08,745 --> 01:17:11,166
- Jump off!
- Jump off!

1056
01:17:18,153 --> 01:17:19,975
Jump off!

1057
01:17:55,367 --> 01:17:59,327
That... was incredible.

1058
01:18:06,758 --> 01:18:09,245
Don't look so shocked.

1059
01:18:09,350 --> 01:18:12,449
It worked.

1060
01:18:12,550 --> 01:18:16,478
Look. Just look at me.

1061
01:18:18,981 --> 01:18:20,923
Stubble.

1062
01:18:21,029 --> 01:18:23,168
Unbelievable.

1063
01:18:23,269 --> 01:18:27,130
Come on, Prop. What do you think?
Am I bigger than my father?

1064
01:18:27,237 --> 01:18:29,822
<i>It's this way. Believe me.</i>

1065
01:18:29,925 --> 01:18:32,925
<i>- Ow! Ow!</i>
- Where are you taking me, you little squirt?

1066
01:18:33,028 --> 01:18:35,417
No, we're nearly there. Ow!

1067
01:18:35,524 --> 01:18:37,597
I knew you were
stringing me along.

1068
01:18:37,701 --> 01:18:39,805
You just tried to get me
away from the house, away-

1069
01:18:41,988 --> 01:18:46,559
away from this
extraordinary contraption.

1070
01:18:46,659 --> 01:18:48,482
<i>Signor Barbarossa.</i>

1071
01:18:48,580 --> 01:18:52,256
What, for heaven's sake,
are you doing with the Contessa?

1072
01:18:52,356 --> 01:18:55,170
- Contessa?
- Yes, Contessa.

1073
01:18:55,268 --> 01:18:57,984
<i>I presume we are here</i>
<i>for the same reason at this late hour.</i>

1074
01:18:58,083 --> 01:19:02,338
Namely, to experience the magic of
this famous merry-go-round in operation.

1075
01:19:02,435 --> 01:19:04,987
<i>Famous? Magic?</i>

1076
01:19:06,722 --> 01:19:08,544
<i>Wait a moment.</i>

1077
01:19:08,642 --> 01:19:13,246
This is the legendary merry-go-round
of the Merciful Sisters!

1078
01:19:13,346 --> 01:19:16,063
Must be worth a fortune!

1079
01:19:16,161 --> 01:19:21,212
<i>You may look older,</i>
<i>but has it made you wiser, Thief Lord?</i>

1080
01:19:21,314 --> 01:19:23,583
Why don't you try it yourself?

1081
01:19:23,682 --> 01:19:25,504
Of course. Why not?

1082
01:19:25,602 --> 01:19:29,377
Shake off some years.
Get rid of those aches and pains.

1083
01:19:29,473 --> 01:19:32,539
- Sharpen the mind perhaps?
- You do know how to work it?

1084
01:19:32,641 --> 01:19:34,583
I do indeed.
Come on, you two.

1085
01:19:34,689 --> 01:19:36,893
Signor Barbarossa
wishes to take a ride.

1086
01:19:36,993 --> 01:19:38,967
Which, um, animal
should I mount?

1087
01:19:40,545 --> 01:19:42,846
I would suggest the lion.

1088
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:54,040
Excellent! I'm ready
for my little test-drive.

1089
01:19:54,144 --> 01:19:56,599
You heard Signor Barbarossa.

1090
01:19:56,703 --> 01:19:58,559
Let's give him the ride he deserves.

1091
01:19:58,656 --> 01:20:02,648
<i>Not too hard. Just a few turns at first.</i>

1092
01:20:02,752 --> 01:20:05,118
Who wouldn't want to
shed a few years, eh?

1093
01:20:09,503 --> 01:20:12,537
Good-bye, wrinkles.
Good-bye, saggy tummy.

1094
01:20:12,639 --> 01:20:15,356
Good-bye, big, fat, wobbly bottom.

1095
01:20:21,471 --> 01:20:25,431
Hey! No! No! Not so hard!
I'm gonna be sick!

1096
01:21:20,507 --> 01:21:24,762
<i>No! My merry-go-round! It's ruined!</i>

1097
01:21:24,859 --> 01:21:27,248
After all the trouble
we went to!

1098
01:21:28,251 --> 01:21:32,757
No. Morosina,
what have we done?

1099
01:21:32,858 --> 01:21:35,160
That fat pig!

1100
01:21:41,338 --> 01:21:44,915
My God!
That was the ride from hell!

1101
01:21:45,018 --> 01:21:48,847
You dolt! You great, fat,
scheming hippopotamus!

1102
01:21:48,953 --> 01:21:51,473
You've just destroyed
what I've spent half my life working on!

1103
01:21:51,577 --> 01:21:53,487
It wouldn't stop!

1104
01:21:53,593 --> 01:21:56,790
Look at what's happened to me!
I'm a respected man!

1105
01:21:56,889 --> 01:21:59,344
Can I at least
recommend a better tailor?

1106
01:22:01,209 --> 01:22:04,406
Oh, Victor, you found him!

1107
01:22:04,505 --> 01:22:07,920
Oh, thank goodness.
We were looking for him all night.

1108
01:22:11,768 --> 01:22:15,117
<i>- Is he okay?</i>
- Yeah, yeah. He's fine.

1109
01:22:15,223 --> 01:22:17,493
He's just a bit tired.

1110
01:22:21,687 --> 01:22:23,662
Where have you been?

1111
01:22:23,767 --> 01:22:25,622
At the merry-go-round
with Scip.

1112
01:22:25,720 --> 01:22:29,494
- Didn't work, did it?
- Yeah, it did.

1113
01:22:29,591 --> 01:22:31,413
Scip's all grown up.

1114
01:22:31,512 --> 01:22:35,405
Really? But you're still
my same Prop.

1115
01:22:35,511 --> 01:22:37,519
Are you disappointed?

1116
01:22:39,798 --> 01:22:43,476
No. I'm happy.

1117
01:22:46,454 --> 01:22:49,650
Bottoms up to bella donna
and big nose here!

1118
01:22:49,750 --> 01:22:53,525
Big nose? Excuse me?

1119
01:22:53,622 --> 01:22:56,938
<i>- Who is this impertinent midget?</i>
- Midget?

1120
01:22:57,046 --> 01:23:00,079
I am Ernesto Barbarossa.

1121
01:23:00,182 --> 01:23:03,280
<i>I am a successful</i>
<i>and honest businessman...</i>

1122
01:23:03,381 --> 01:23:05,486
and enjoy the respect
of this fair city.

1123
01:23:05,589 --> 01:23:09,200
<i>And who might you be?</i>

1124
01:23:11,445 --> 01:23:15,023
Oh, my God. It's true. It works.

1125
01:23:15,125 --> 01:23:17,361
Stop it. You've had enough.

1126
01:23:17,461 --> 01:23:19,730
What are you, my father?

1127
01:23:19,829 --> 01:23:23,505
You'll do as you're told,
or it'll be straight to bed with no story.

1128
01:23:25,299 --> 01:23:27,504
Sorry I had to
bring him here, Ida.

1129
01:23:27,604 --> 01:23:30,703
<i>He's afraid of the dark. He didn't want</i>
<i>to stay in the shop on his own.</i>

1130
01:23:30,804 --> 01:23:35,113
Shop? Excuse me. Sorry.
I don't understand.

1131
01:23:35,219 --> 01:23:38,667
And you? I've heard of growth spurts,
but this is ridiculous.

1132
01:23:38,771 --> 01:23:42,067
I mean, what are you?
Your own older brother?

1133
01:23:42,163 --> 01:23:45,163
Or the winner of a Thief Lord
look-alike competition or what?

1134
01:23:45,267 --> 01:23:47,438
How about your new assistant?

1135
01:23:50,259 --> 01:23:53,706
Can someone please explain
what's going on here...

1136
01:23:53,810 --> 01:23:56,592
before I start drinking port
for breakfast as well?

1137
01:23:56,690 --> 01:24:00,367
Look. It's only me.
Just a bit taller and older.

1138
01:24:04,850 --> 01:24:07,054
Bo! Where did Victor find you?

1139
01:24:07,154 --> 01:24:08,976
- In the Stella.
- Ah.

1140
01:24:09,074 --> 01:24:11,626
Of all the places
we never thought to look. The Stella.

1141
01:24:11,729 --> 01:24:15,559
And now you're back. That's
the most important thing. So is Prop.

1142
01:24:15,665 --> 01:24:19,920
<i>He went to the merry-go-round,</i>
<i>and it works like I always said.</i>

1143
01:24:20,017 --> 01:24:22,864
<i>It really worked? No way.</i>

1144
01:24:25,969 --> 01:24:29,744
So, this is the little
gang of criminals.

1145
01:24:29,841 --> 01:24:33,833
<i>The sooner we put you all</i>
<i>behind bars, the better.</i>

1146
01:24:33,937 --> 01:24:38,638
- Oh, there he is, the little runaway.
- He's staying with me.

1147
01:24:38,736 --> 01:24:42,052
- Mmm. As you keep telling us.
- Get out of the way.

1148
01:24:42,159 --> 01:24:44,876
- No!
- Give me my son!

1149
01:24:44,976 --> 01:24:47,790
<i>- He's not your son, you skanky old bat!</i>

1150
01:24:47,888 --> 01:24:51,816
How dare you speak to my wife
like that, you little monster?

1151
01:24:53,359 --> 01:24:55,627
Get off!
Get off me!

1152
01:24:55,727 --> 01:24:58,510
<i>Leave him alone, you big bully!</i>

1153
01:24:58,608 --> 01:25:00,614
<i>Grab his ear!</i>

1154
01:25:03,374 --> 01:25:05,643
Oh!

1155
01:25:06,702 --> 01:25:08,524
Enough!

1156
01:25:11,598 --> 01:25:13,802
<i>Now...</i>

1157
01:25:13,902 --> 01:25:16,105
just hand over your brother,
and we'll forget this ever happened.

1158
01:25:16,206 --> 01:25:20,613
- It doesn't work, snot nose.
- Oh, really?

1159
01:25:20,718 --> 01:25:23,467
Would you like to find out?

1160
01:25:40,013 --> 01:25:45,031
- Now look what you done, you stupid child!
- Leave him alone!

1161
01:25:45,133 --> 01:25:47,882
He's six years old, and he's got more sense
than the pair of you put together!

1162
01:25:47,980 --> 01:25:51,874
It was an accident!
He- He said it didn't work!

1163
01:25:51,980 --> 01:25:54,729
<i>I suggest you</i>
<i>put the gun down.</i>

1164
01:25:54,828 --> 01:25:57,348
Leave. Leave here. Leave Venice,
and leave these boys alone.

1165
01:25:57,451 --> 01:26:00,201
<i>You're not fit to look after</i>
<i>a tortoise, never mind a child.</i>

1166
01:26:00,299 --> 01:26:02,950
Now get out,
before I call the police.

1167
01:26:12,139 --> 01:26:15,400
Wow. That certainly told them.

1168
01:26:15,499 --> 01:26:17,702
See what I mean
about being a grown-up?

1169
01:26:17,802 --> 01:26:19,875
<i>How am I supposed to sleep</i>
<i>with all this noise?</i>

1170
01:26:19,978 --> 01:26:24,386
<i>Does anybody have an aspirin?</i>

1171
01:26:25,834 --> 01:26:27,656
Only speak
when you're spoken to.

1172
01:26:27,753 --> 01:26:29,642
They better be rich,
and I mean filthy rich.

1173
01:26:29,738 --> 01:26:32,553
Now do try to keep
a straight face, Ida.

1174
01:26:32,649 --> 01:26:34,536
Good afternoon.

1175
01:26:34,633 --> 01:26:36,456
Monsignor and I...

1176
01:26:36,554 --> 01:26:38,757
are the principals
of the orphanage...

1177
01:26:38,856 --> 01:26:40,864
of the Merciful Sisters.

1178
01:26:40,970 --> 01:26:42,792
How can we help you?

1179
01:26:42,889 --> 01:26:45,507
<i>We understand you're looking</i>
<i>for child to adopt.</i>

1180
01:26:45,609 --> 01:26:51,141
We have conducted some research,
and we have concluded that
you are of impeccable character.

1181
01:26:51,240 --> 01:26:53,095
Oh, thank you.

1182
01:26:53,192 --> 01:26:57,949
Forgive our presumptuousness,
but we saw an opportunity...

1183
01:26:58,056 --> 01:27:00,511
for little Ernesto...

1184
01:27:00,616 --> 01:27:04,031
<i>to find the happiness</i>
<i>of a loving home.</i>

1185
01:27:04,135 --> 01:27:07,103
What an adorable little fellow you-

1186
01:27:07,207 --> 01:27:09,029
Oh, what do you say, Ernesto?

1187
01:27:09,127 --> 01:27:12,705
<i>- Scusi?</i>
- Oh.

1188
01:27:23,590 --> 01:27:25,478
<i>Whoo-hoo!</i>

1189
01:27:27,495 --> 01:27:29,382
Man, it's even more
than the fake stuff.

1190
01:27:31,750 --> 01:27:33,572
Can you count up 50,000?

1191
01:27:33,669 --> 01:27:35,612
What am I, Einstein?

1192
01:27:35,718 --> 01:27:39,014
And we return the fake money
to Barbarossa.

1193
01:27:39,110 --> 01:27:41,499
Sixty. Eighty.

1194
01:27:41,606 --> 01:27:43,776
Maybe a little bonus.

1195
01:27:43,877 --> 01:27:45,700
The deal
was 50 grand.

1196
01:27:45,797 --> 01:27:48,928
Okay, 50 grand.
Interest.

1197
01:27:49,028 --> 01:27:51,395
Tax.

1198
01:27:51,493 --> 01:27:53,730
Expenses.

1199
01:27:55,877 --> 01:27:58,332
<i>Has everybody got their share now?</i>

1200
01:27:58,437 --> 01:28:00,705
- Uh, everybody except you.
- I'll use it to buy you this boat...

1201
01:28:00,804 --> 01:28:03,041
and then put the rest of it
in bank accounts for each of you.

1202
01:28:03,140 --> 01:28:06,435
Bank accounts? What next?
My midlife crisis?

1203
01:28:06,532 --> 01:28:09,380
I want to buy this boat.
How much do you want for it?

1204
01:28:09,477 --> 01:28:11,299
7,000.

1205
01:28:11,396 --> 01:28:13,698
<i>- Is it seaworthy?</i>
<i>- Certainly. It's just been refitted.</i>

1206
01:28:13,796 --> 01:28:15,487
It looks as seaworthy
as a rubber duck.

1207
01:28:15,588 --> 01:28:17,977
- I'll give you five.
- Six.

1208
01:28:19,043 --> 01:28:21,149
Five, five.

1209
01:28:22,212 --> 01:28:25,245
Done. Let me get the deed.

1210
01:28:25,347 --> 01:28:29,057
Now, don't go tearing around
Canal Grande at night in this thing.

1211
01:28:29,155 --> 01:28:32,450
- Uh, and what would give us that idea?
- I expect you to behave.

1212
01:28:32,547 --> 01:28:36,540
<i>Hey, that's a laugh</i>
<i>coming from you, Thief Lord.</i>

1213
01:28:36,643 --> 01:28:39,544
- Taxi.
- Taxi! Taxi!

1214
01:28:39,650 --> 01:28:41,538
- Taxi! Here.
- Taxi! Over here.

1215
01:28:41,634 --> 01:28:43,772
<i>Taxi. Taxi.</i>

1216
01:28:43,874 --> 01:28:46,176
Taxi. Taxi. Tax-

1217
01:29:06,305 --> 01:29:09,720
Check out our boat.

1218
01:29:09,824 --> 01:29:11,711
Just test-driving
the new water wheels.

1219
01:29:13,633 --> 01:29:16,283
I'm gonna go look for my dad.

1220
01:29:16,384 --> 01:29:18,489
<i>Hey, boss.</i>
<i>I'll see you tomorrow in the office.</i>

1221
01:29:20,384 --> 01:29:23,482
Come on, Mosca. Let's go!

1222
01:29:23,584 --> 01:29:25,406
- Victor?
- Yeah?

1223
01:29:25,504 --> 01:29:27,478
What's Bo and I
supposed to do now?

1224
01:29:27,584 --> 01:29:29,820
- What do you mean?
- What about me?

1225
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:32,092
I know what I wanna do.

1226
01:29:32,192 --> 01:29:34,014
Stay with Ida.

1227
01:29:34,112 --> 01:29:36,184
Well, he's right, of course.
You can't leave me now.

1228
01:29:36,286 --> 01:29:38,675
<i>I just rattle around</i>
<i>in that big old house.</i>

1229
01:29:38,783 --> 01:29:40,605
Victor, say something.
Tell them they can't leave.

1230
01:29:40,703 --> 01:29:44,597
Okay, you heard her.
You have to stay.

1231
01:29:45,598 --> 01:29:47,453
I think we'd make
quite a family.

1232
01:29:47,551 --> 01:29:50,900
- What?
- Victor, Victor! Say yes! Say yes!

1233
01:29:51,006 --> 01:29:53,689
Whoa!

1234
01:29:53,790 --> 01:29:55,962
<i>Whoa!</i>

1235
01:29:56,962 --> 01:30:06,962
