<i>If you want a song played,</i>
<i>call the radio station right now.</i>

3
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,434
<i>You park in an abandoned lot.</i>
<i>You attend the movie.</i>

4
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,276
<i>You come out to find that thieves</i>

5
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,116
<i>This wouldn't have happened...</i>

10
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,352
What are you doing?

11
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,950
- Here.
- Oh, never mind.

12
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,953
Morning.

13
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,352
Coffee.

14
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,990
What time did you go home
last night, 3:00 a.m.?

15
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,158
You look like you've been
in a plane crash.

16
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,559
- This may shock you, but humans sleep.
- I know, I know.

17
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,871
Gruen gave me a big project.
I think it's some kind of test.

18
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,159
Where's my depreciation schedule?
I've lost my deprec...

19
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,952
I think I have everything.
Profit plan...

20
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,593
...flow charts...

21
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,355
- How much time do I have?
- Four minutes.

22
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,951
Walter.

23
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,269
- You should wind down.
- I'm getting something out of it.

24
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,352
You won't believe
what happened last night.

25
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,597
You worked on your presentation?
Not at all?

26
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,109
I had drinks at The Blue Dragon...

27
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:42,118
Don't tell me one of your sex stories.

28
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:47,189
- Bringing the embalmer tonight?
- She's not an embalmer. She does hair.

29
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,428
- No. I have a date with a gorgeous...
- In the parking lot of the club...

30
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,030
...I see this woman,
maybe 35, kind of classy.

31
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:01,189
I figure she's waiting for her car.
So, what the hell, I talk to her.

32
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:06,468
Turns out, she came in a limo. I say,
"I've never been in a limo before."

33
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,912
She stares at me for 30 seconds,
then says, "Let's take a ride."

34
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:16,319
In the limo, she pushes a button and
a wall's up between us and the driver.

35
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:19,830
She hits another button,
a sunroof opens.

36
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,600
Bar slides open.

37
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,429
She pours us vodka,
plays Sly and the Family Stone.

38
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,632
Next thing I know, we slide onto PCH.

39
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,795
Full moon, 2:00 a. M,
vodka, limo, music.

40
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,752
And I'm thinking...

41
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,033
- I don't believe you.
- We start to kiss.

42
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,358
I slide my hand up her dress.
What do I find? Garter belt!

43
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,712
- All your women wear garter belts!
- So I tell her I want her...

44
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:55,436
...from behind, standing up,
with my head sticking out the sunroof.

45
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,119
So we start doing it.

46
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,199
We're going 60, my head's out
the roof, my hair's flying...

47
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:06,155
This didn't happen. There was
no limo, no woman, no sunroof...

48
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,719
That's disgusting.

49
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:14,755
I'm ashamed to know you. How do you
get women to do these things?

50
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:20,155
As you know by now, Yakamoto has
agreed to entrust the management...

51
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,239
...of all his personal
and corporate assets to us.

52
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,750
No small thanks
to the efforts of Harry Gruen.

53
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,838
I'm sure Mr. Yakamoto's
confidence in us...

54
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:36,431
...will increase with the lethal charm
you'll all exude tonight.

55
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,597
A word of caution.

56
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:42,674
He's very traditional.
Old-fashioned ideas about women.

57
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,155
Wives must follow certain rules.

58
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,559
Can't speak until spoken to, don't sit
until he does, all that crap.

59
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,558
Meanwhile...

60
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,549
...he keeps a stable of concubines
you wouldn't believe.

61
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,148
Anyway...

62
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,358
...this is a very old-world guy.

63
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:12,509
So watch yourselves, and keep
your wives away from the mai tais.

64
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,508
Okay, a few facts
about the man. Denny...

65
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,757
...show us Yakamoto's
holdings for '85.

66
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:26,111
Damn. Spreadsheets are still printing.
Machine's been down.

67
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,676
Okay, forget it.
Walter, let's have your report.

68
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:47,555
Yakamoto Worldwide has shown almost
recession-proof capabilities.

69
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:51,275
Even in a disastrous third quarter...

70
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,031
...his fish oil conglomerate...

71
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,994
...bolstered his net worth
by some 27%.

72
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,959
Walter, you look like shit.
Where were you last night?

73
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,559
I was here until 3.

74
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:14,389
This is the money business.
Image is everything.

75
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,433
Look at you. This jacket is shit.

76
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:22,395
See, men like Yakamoto don't make
deals with the lint man, here.

77
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,229
- Now look at Denny. That's a suit.
- Armani, sir.

78
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,874
- Take a few tips from him.
- Yes, sir.

79
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:33,392
We'll make a good assistant
portfolio assessor out of you yet.

80
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,158
See you at dinner.

81
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,154
- Who's he bringing?
- I don't know, sir.

82
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,954
God, I hope it's not the embalmer.

83
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,389
- Can I borrow your wife?
- Sure. $50.

84
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,319
I'm serious. Denise bagged out on me.

85
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:10,308
I need a date. They don't know
Susie's my sister-in-law.

86
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,717
She'd do it, but it's our anniversary.

87
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,115
- Going to Spago's.
- I'm ruined.

88
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,312
Watch this. This guy'll make an offer.

89
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,830
- Have you decided?
- I can't go higher than 15,500.

90
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,315
No can do. It's 17,000 list.

91
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,080
What? You told me it was 18,000 list!

92
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:33,229
You made $1000 off your brother?
I'm bankrolling your dinner at Spago's!

93
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,510
Stop it. You're scaring him.

94
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:40,032
You're scaring me. Jesus, you'd
cheat your own flesh and blood.

95
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,753
We'll talk.

96
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,916
- I'll make it up to you.
- You'll write me a check?

97
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,236
No, but I know this fantastic...

98
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,638
Stop! You're gonna recommend
one of your psychotic friends.

99
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,796
I resent that, Walter.

100
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,074
You've set me up before, only you
forget to mention one crucial detail:

101
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:05,432
She's a dopehead, a lesbian,
keeps dead cats in the freezer...

102
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:09,519
What a New Year's!
"The champagne's in the icebox."

103
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,396
I'm sorry. Seriously, I know someone.
Nadia Gates, Susie's cousin.

104
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,997
- Ted, I don't want to hear it.
- Don't you trust your own brother?

105
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,994
No argument there.
But, no bullshit, Nadia's amazing.

106
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,236
She's just moved back to town...

107
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,432
...and wants to meet people!
- What's she like?

108
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,713
She's a sweetheart, good sense
of humour. You'll love her!

109
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:36,549
I won't love her
because this won't happen!

110
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:40,036
Suit yourself.
But I highly recommend her.

111
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,356
Talk about the kiss of death!

112
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:49,351
- Call us if you change your mind.
- I won't!

113
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,154
Hi. Is Chloe there?

114
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,839
Do you have the rifle range's number?

115
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,750
Never mind. Look, I'll just
call her later. Thanks.

116
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,515
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Is she reasonably pretty?

117
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,592
"Reasonably" doesn't begin
to describe it.

118
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,396
I'm looking at her picture now.
She's an honest-to-God knockout.

119
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:41,152
Ted, just this once, please.
The truth.

120
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:45,030
Susie, tell Walter Nadia's pretty.

121
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,390
She's very pretty, Walter.

122
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,398
- When was the picture taken?
- <i>Four years ago.</i>

123
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:57,553
Four years? She could've been
disfigured in four years!

124
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,833
- She could've gained 100 pounds!
- She's gorgeous! Stop it!

125
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,598
I almost forgot!

126
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:07,190
Don't get her drunk.
She loses control completely.

127
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,633
But don't get her drunk. If you do...

128
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,638
...she loses control!

129
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:17,436
Loses her inhibitions,
or she pees on the floor?

130
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,996
What's "lose control" mean?

131
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,033
Oh, you know, she gets real wild.

132
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,151
She gets real wild!

133
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,756
All right! I may kill you later,
but I'm doing this now...

134
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,712
...before I change my mind.

135
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,680
- Walter?
- Yeah.

136
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,353
Come on in.

137
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,956
I'll just be a minute.

138
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:15,594
I hope you don't mind
helping me with my suitcase.

139
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,759
I'm moving out of here.
I'll be staying with a friend.

140
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,749
If you feel like it,
a friend's having an art exhibit.

141
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:28,839
If we have time before dinner,
maybe we could go?

142
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,951
Yeah, no problem.

143
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,676
Well, here goes, Walter. Ready or not.

144
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,759
Oh, damn it!
This has been going on all night.

145
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,437
There may be some matches over there.

146
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,951
Let me look.

147
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,556
It may be over there.

148
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,748
Here.

149
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,476
Now this is a blind date.
Here's your chance to run for it.

150
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,154
Your very last chance.

151
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,956
You missed your chance.

152
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,674
I'm glad.

153
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,354
I had no idea.

154
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,151
Do you know this artist?

155
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,909
I've met him once.
He's Susie's friend.

156
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,556
I mean, coming was her idea.
We can go.

157
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:48,316
- I don't have any obligation to him.
- No, come on.

158
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,590
We're both adults, aren't we?

159
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,356
I thought I was.

160
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,959
I don't know. Maybe I'm not now.

161
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,550
Can I ask you something?

162
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,351
Yeah, I guess so.

163
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:11,269
Why didn't you have a date tonight?
Is there something I should know?

164
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:16,110
I can't imagine why you don't
have a date every night of the week.

165
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,596
Know what? I was thinking
the same about you.

166
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:23,952
- Come on, I'm serious.
- Me too. I was thinking that.

167
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,356
I asked you first.

168
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,032
I stopped dating
about three months ago.

169
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,913
I was involved,
but it didn't work out.

170
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:44,148
Boy, how it didn't work out. So I was
living in Baton Rouge with my mama.

171
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,553
And you're my first date.
But you almost weren't.

172
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,950
Susie talked me into it...

173
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,557
...l'm glad to say.

174
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,352
So how about you?

175
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,959
Well, my date backed out
at the last minute...

176
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,351
...l'm glad to say.

177
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,951
You want some candy?

178
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,355
I'm not much of a candy person.

179
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,596
That's good.
I always was a candy person.

180
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:23,958
Some people drink,
some people do drugs. I do sugar.

181
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,555
This looks Japanese.

182
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,959
"Master and Concubines"?

183
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,151
It's Yakamoto.

184
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,472
- What is?
- The big business dinner tonight...

185
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:44,389
...is for this Japanese industrialist
new client of ours.

186
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,309
He's old-world Japanese.
His wife's like his slave...

187
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,431
...and he keeps concubines.

188
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:54,189
- You're kidding.
- No. His wife knows all about it.

189
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,755
It's traditional or something.

190
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,235
Tell me something.
Are you into those traditions?

191
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:07,355
No, I'm actually a
one-concubine kind of guy...

192
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,553
...actually.
- Good.

193
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:14,752
So, what was it that made you
break up with this guy?

194
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,952
- What do you mean?
- What was he like?

195
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,390
Psychopath. Like that guy over there.

196
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,993
What's wrong?

197
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,954
That's him! That's my psychotic
ex-boyfriend David.

198
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,198
There. The guy in the goofy bow tie.

199
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,032
He looks okay to me.

200
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,915
He's been chasing me
for three months. I moved twice.

201
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:39,631
I think he's coming over here!
Watch it. Please just hide.

202
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,353
Just relax.

203
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,073
Hello, Nadia.

204
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:51,034
- David, don't start anything.
- I just want to say hello.

205
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,798
Hi, I'm David.

206
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,037
- Walter.
- She has every reason to be upset.

207
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,835
I was so in love,
I made a total asshole of myself.

208
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,952
Apology accepted. Nice to meet you.

209
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:06,550
- How long you been dating?
- None of your business!

210
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:10,958
It is my business.
There's not a night that's gone by...

211
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,357
You son of a bitch,
are you drilling her?!

212
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,949
Shut up and leave her alone!

213
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,677
Wait, I want to talk to you.
I'll find you!

214
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,156
- I have an idea.
- Yeah? What?

215
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,352
Thank you.

216
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,154
- Okay, Walter, what's going on?
- Well...

217
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,552
We have about half an hour.
Indulge me.

218
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:29,555
- You like guitar?
- Oh, yeah, I do.

219
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,834
- <i>We're set. How's the level for you?</i>
- It's basically cool.

220
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:39,079
Turn up the monitors a bit
and we'll be there. Thanks.

221
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,192
- How are you?
- Good, Stanley. How are you?

222
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,830
Did you bring your guitar?

223
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,557
No, I brought something better
than a guitar.

224
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,875
- How you doing?
- Hi, how are you?

225
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,752
Good, good.

226
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,155
You ever hear him play?
He's really fantastic.

227
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,752
Relax...

228
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,549
...sip a little champagne.

229
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,360
I don't think I should drink.

230
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,198
The last three or four times I...

231
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,756
I mean, it sort of makes me go crazy!

232
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:26,556
Well, one little glass
isn't gonna make you go crazy.

233
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,755
This is our first toast.

234
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:38,757
To auspicious beginnings.

235
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,192
It's really good.

236
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,949
<i>Stanley Jordan, take two. Rolling.</i>

237
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,357
So, what made you think
to stop by here?

238
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:16,756
I recorded here when I thought
I wanted to be a musician.

239
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:21,719
I played guitar. But I really
don't have time for it now.

240
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:28,159
I played all the time. I went to
the bathroom carrying a Stratocaster.

241
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:31,955
I drove my mom nuts. I got tendonitis.

242
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,757
Why did you give it up?

243
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,153
Well...

244
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,437
Because if you want
to be a musician...

245
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:49,395
...you're guaranteeing yourself
a life of poverty and obscurity...

246
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,359
...unless you're talented
like Stanley.

247
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,555
And...

248
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,471
...I got a good job now...

249
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:01,554
...good car. Next year,
I'll be able to get a condo.

250
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,759
I don't know.

251
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,556
It just kind of made sense.

252
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:13,752
We're gonna be late.
Let me give you a little...

253
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,149
Oh, I'm getting bad.

254
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,558
I'm starting to feel the champagne.

255
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,478
That's okay.

256
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,358
Feel away.

257
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,915
Come on.

258
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,756
Hi, I called for Davis,
for two, please.

259
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:20,757
- Joseph, table six.
- Follow me, please.

260
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:25,590
Please don't touch the flowers.
The arrangement is very expensive.

261
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:29,952
These things don't smell.
They're no good anyway.

262
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,791
- Sorry. Oh, my God.
- It's all right.

263
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,156
- You sure?
- It'll be fine.

264
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,429
- Lovely looking girl.
- Thank you.

265
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,596
- You know my wife.
- Yes, hello.

266
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,360
Very nice to meet you, Mrs. Gruen.

267
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:06,197
Thank you. Do you think you could
find me some safety pins?

268
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,152
Safety pins?

269
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,555
No, I don't think so.

270
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,908
There's a lot of roast beef in here.

271
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:17,635
Would you care for a cocktail?

272
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:22,152
- A bottle of your finest champagne.
- Very good.

273
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,759
Thank you.

274
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,957
Oh, my God.

275
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,628
That's Yakamoto.

276
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,953
Good evening.

277
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,274
- My wife.
- Very nice to meet you, Mr. Yakimoto.

278
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,351
Yakamoto.

279
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,351
Mrs. Yakamoto.

280
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,673
- How lovely you look.
- Thank you.

281
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:54,118
That's incredible.
She's like a geisha girl.

282
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:14,350
Cupcake, would you excuse me
for just a minute?

283
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,753
Business.

284
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,193
- They still do that in Japan?
- I don't know...

285
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,551
Walter, you old dog.

286
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,990
- Denny Gordon, this is Nadia Gates.
- How do you do?

287
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,994
- Hi.
- I gotta hand it to you.

288
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,079
This is the most exciting
woman in the place.

289
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:43,317
Thank you. Nice tie.
Where did you get it?

290
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:47,957
I don't remember. Probably
one of those places over on Rodeo.

291
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:51,948
- Where's that?
- You don't know where Rodeo is?

292
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:55,755
No, I know where it is.
I just wondered if you did.

293
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,195
What happened to your pocket?

294
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,955
- Oh, we had a little...
- That's the new style.

295
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,749
See? Oh, that looks nice.

296
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:15,556
- Aren't you forgetting your date?
- My date? Oh, right. Yes.

297
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:19,355
I do hope that we'll meet again.

298
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:24,836
"Denny Gordon, supervisor,
real estate analysis."

299
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:28,316
How did you get that?
It fell out of my pocket.

300
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:32,195
- You pressed it in my hand.
- I don't think I did that.

301
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,994
- You put it right in my hand.
- You see...

302
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:40,228
- Why? Did you think I'd call you up?
- Come on, you know how it is.

303
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,000
No, I don't think
he does know how it is.

304
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:47,950
He's not a vain slimeball pig
that's led around by his dick.

305
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:54,757
I guess that just about
sums it up, huh?

306
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,956
All's fair in love and...

307
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:02,994
She's right. You really are
a slimeball pig.

308
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,909
Hey, Denny! Your ex-fiancée,
she just took a hike.

309
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,348
Oh, jeez.

310
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,515
Honey?

311
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,551
Sweetheart!

312
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,758
I'll be right back, sir.
You look lovely.

313
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,109
Thank you.

314
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,309
Pumpkin?

315
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:28,749
- My boss, Mr. Gruen, is watching us.
- Where is he?

316
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,151
- Boy, that was...
- You shouldn't have any more.

317
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,951
- Are you ready?
- Yes, we are.

318
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:48,551
Will you order for me, please?

319
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,750
We'll start with
the <i>étuvée de veau au vin</i>...

320
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,758
Which soup?

321
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:06,310
We'll have the <i>crème de concombre.</i>

322
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,151
<i>Végétable</i>?

323
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,556
This one right here.

324
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,036
The <i>gratin dauphinois</i>?

325
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,837
A bit of a clash with the
<i>veau au vin rouge,</i> don't you think?

326
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:26,350
Excuse me. Come here.
Can I ask you something?

327
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:32,156
Do you really speak French
or just bullshit menu French?

328
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,239
- I trained in Paris.
- Oh, good.

329
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,908
What did you say?

330
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:46,352
I told him to stick a skewer
up his ass and flambé himself.

331
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,028
- What did he say?
- He called me a slut.

332
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,754
Now, just a goddamn minute here.

333
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,274
What did he say?

334
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,950
"Your taste in women
is as bad as your French."

335
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,549
How do you say, "Step outside"?

336
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,153
This is a...

337
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,156
Excuse me.

338
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:13,597
I said, "The champagne
tastes like horse piss."

339
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:17,634
He said, "I should know,"
which is quite a good comeback.

340
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,752
- What the hell...?
- Oh, my God!

341
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,355
- I'm sorry.
- What did he say?

342
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:26,154
I don't know. I don't speak French.

343
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,311
He insulted my date.

344
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,954
It's all Henri's fault. He's French.

345
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,798
Hey, Mr. Y.

346
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:38,510
If you don't mind,
that is the loveliest necklace.

347
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,439
It's so pretty. Where did you get it?

348
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,437
I don't speak English.

349
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,949
He insulted my date, Nadia!

350
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,554
- Oh, my God.
- Go back to your seat.

351
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,314
- She can't talk?
- They're our guests.

352
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:56,718
- I just asked about the necklace.
- You are foolish and silly.

353
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:00,230
- Leaving so soon? Sit.
- Go jump on your concubine.

354
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:03,238
Did you hear her? I have no concubine.

355
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,750
Walter, get this woman out of here!

356
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,755
No, no. Don't do that.

357
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:15,071
Why don't you walk
over there, Nadia? Here.

358
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,958
Oh, take it to her.

359
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:21,554
I hope this doesn't undermine
your confidence in us.

360
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:32,712
- I worked very hard for this job.
- We can sort...

361
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,633
- What's going on out here?
- Oh, my God.

362
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,469
- Please, come back to the restaurant.
- Mrs. Gruen, hi.

363
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,719
Mrs. Yakamoto.

364
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:45,555
- She doesn't speak English.
- Just get out of here!

365
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,320
Mrs. Yakamoto, I have your hair.

366
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:52,354
I'm going to just
slip it under the door.

367
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,919
Got it?

368
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:57,869
I'll tell your husband
you'll be out in a minute.

369
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:03,716
Don't take that
concubine stuff from anybody.

370
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:07,071
- I no speak English!
- You a California resident?

371
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:10,352
- I no speak English!
- Know what you're entitled?

372
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,232
I no speak English!

373
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:17,639
California law states you're entitled
to 50% of your husband's assets.

374
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,596
Fifty percent?

375
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:26,629
Mr. Gruen, please. I'm very sorry.
I had no way...

376
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:29,400
Walter, go away. Just go away.

377
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:33,434
Bottle of Meyer-Fonné Barsac.
Hors d'oeuvres, on the house?

378
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:38,475
Sir, I can't begin to tell you
how dreadfully sorry l...

379
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,996
Attention! Attention, everybody!

380
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,032
Mrs. Yakamoto needs
a good divorce lawyer now...

381
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,869
...because Mr. Yakamoto
is worth over $100 million.

382
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,390
- Miss.
- I'll kill her!

383
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,273
Harry...

384
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,717
Don't touch me. Please.

385
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,076
Did you hurt yourself?

386
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,714
Do I have to say the words?

387
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,269
- I'm fired?
- Fired?

388
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:23,158
I only wish we were in the Army...

389
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:27,672
...so I could have you shot.
- Yes, sir.

390
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,514
Twice.

391
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,679
That was so much fun!

392
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:41,079
My face is numb.
What do you wanna do now?

393
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,871
There's a party down the street.
Let's go!

394
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:50,279
Are you insane? You destroyed my life
and now you want to go to a party?

395
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,678
- You don't like me, do you?
- I've never hit a woman before, but...

396
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,110
- Let's make up.
- That won't work.

397
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:00,471
- Of course, it will.
- It won't! Now stop it!

398
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:05,715
- Nadia, I'm driving the car!
- Let's do it! Let's do it right now!

399
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:09,270
- We're on the freeway!
- Who cares?

400
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:14,674
I'm driving 55 miles an hour, here!
Will you, for chri...

401
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,559
Stop it!

402
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:28,912
- Stop, please!
- You're frowning again.

403
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:33,358
Stop it! For chrissakes,
there's a car behind us!

404
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,232
Gotta do better than that.

405
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,876
Someone's getting out of the car.
Sit over there.

406
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:41,150
- David!
- What? This is...

407
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,396
- Car trouble?
- You following us?

408
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,558
- I'm worried about her.
- I'm taking her home.

409
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:51,436
You let her drink? Son of a bitch,
don't you know she can't drink?

410
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:54,916
- Nadia, get out of the car!
- Stay in the car.

411
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:59,591
- Hey, that's a... That's a $500 bra!
- I'm gonna kill you!

412
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:03,759
You were gonna drill her.
I'll kill you!

413
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,269
Can't we just talk about it?

414
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,718
Honey, stay in the car.

415
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:12,435
- I'll stay in the car.
- You don't love her like I do!

416
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,757
- I believe you!
- He doesn't love you like I do!

417
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:19,873
What are you doing?
Get out of my car! Hey!

418
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,276
That son of a bitch!

419
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,670
I'm gonna kill you too!

420
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,478
Walter, what...

421
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,472
You son of a bitch, I'll kill you!

422
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,877
Damn bastard!

423
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:06,470
Jesus, that guy's a maniac.
He was really trying to kill me.

424
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,518
Why'd you break up?

425
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:12,269
You must be the best match
since Bonnie and Clyde.

426
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,671
Come on.

427
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,508
I'm sorry.

428
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,270
I really am. I...

429
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,878
It was a cheap shot.

430
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:40,038
- I wasn't crying about that.
- What are you crying about?

431
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:47,757
I just saw David chasing you
around the car, and I got sad.

432
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,672
Me too.

433
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,676
Do you have a Kleenex?

434
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,077
A handkerchief?

435
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,668
Here.

436
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,958
I hate it when my eyes get all puffy.

437
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,675
I get all stuffed up. I look terrible.

438
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,071
Are my eyes puffy?

439
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:23,075
Can we stop so I can blow my nose
and wash my face?

440
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,475
I gotta go to the bathroom.

441
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,870
Yeah, sure. Okay.

442
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,835
Thank you.

443
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:20,752
- Can I help you?
- Fill it with unleaded.

444
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,269
- Super?
- Regular.

445
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,712
Let me say two words:

446
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:30,595
Engine knocks. Rings and valves,
$900. Check, please.

447
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,634
You can pay me now
or pay my service manager later.

448
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,559
- Fill it with unleaded.
- Super?

449
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,671
The guy wants super.

450
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,391
- She's not in there.
- What?

451
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:55,388
The girl who came with you?
She's at Freda & Freddie's.

452
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,677
The disco.

453
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,475
Where's the ladies' room?

454
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,277
Thank you very much.

455
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,520
I'm looking for my date.

456
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:06,508
She's a brunette with a red dress on,
really pretty.

457
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:11,316
And she came in
the bathroom here and, see...

458
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:14,632
She was in the bathroom
at the gas station.

459
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:18,753
She took a long time.
I went to get her and she was gone.

460
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,872
And the gas station guy said...

461
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:28,870
...that she came in here.
I figured she went into this...

462
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:32,951
I'll wait right here
at the bar for her, okay?

463
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:37,711
Bartender, can I get
a Perrier and a soda? I mean...

464
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,753
A Scotch and soda.
Something like that.

465
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,518
Can I buy you a drink?

466
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:47,236
She had a thing with her ex,
and she got a little emotional.

467
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:51,149
She started crying and wanted
to stop at a gas station.

468
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,237
So we stopped next door.

469
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,558
She took a long time.
When I went to get her, she'd left.

470
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:02,515
The guy said she came here.
She probably went into this bathroom.

471
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:07,919
It wasn't like I was trying to
look in. I was trying to find her.

472
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,475
Come dance with me.

473
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:15,073
- This is the girl. Right here.
- Five dollars, please.

474
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:24,031
- I know you're a good dancer.
- No, I really don't wanna dance.

475
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:29,189
- Stop, it's not funny.
- Come on.

476
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,476
I'm sorry.

477
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,677
Let's just go.

478
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:39,557
Please. I'm sorry.

479
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,069
All right, you ready for this?

480
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,870
- Let's go now.
- Please, Walter.

481
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:31,958
- Hi, I just wanted to come by and...
- David, don't...

482
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:36,597
I came by to apologize.
I still love her very much.

483
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:40,236
What? So you can drill her?
You son of a bitch!

484
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,190
You bitch!

485
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,311
We're leaving. Now!

486
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,473
You son of a bitch!

487
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:18,473
Let's go before the cops show up.

488
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,876
Come on, come on!

489
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,276
Move it, move it, move it.

490
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,075
Get in. Get in!

491
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,115
How much?

492
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,356
- Cash or plastic?
- Cash!

493
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,552
It's $12.50.
What's going on over there?

494
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:40,718
I wanna talk to you.
Get out of the car.

495
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:43,275
Just get out of the...

496
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:47,670
Get back inside, you stupid idiot!

497
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:04,478
Your ex's hobby is killing people.
What's his profession?

498
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:09,671
- He's a defence lawyer.
- For who? Jack the Ripper?

499
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,871
It's not funny.

500
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,470
I'm taking you home.
Where do your friends live?

501
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:21,311
They live on Elm and East Hill.

502
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:24,751
Your friends live
on Elm and East Hill?

503
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,871
No, the party.

504
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:30,268
I'm not taking you to any party!

505
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,072
Party!

506
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:36,274
I'm gonna take you home.

507
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:37,919
To Baton Rouge?

508
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:43,513
I'm taking you to your friends' house.
Where do they live?

509
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:48,237
- We have to get on the freeway.
- No! No more freeways.

510
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:52,071
It's the only way I know
how to get there.

511
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:58,070
- What's the exact address?
- I know the house.

512
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:06,352
- I'm getting on the freeway.
- Where's the hole?

513
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,199
But if you make one move...
You listening?

514
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:12,278
If you make one move
that makes me nervous...

515
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:16,268
...l'll put you out at the first
intersection. Understand?

516
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,631
Don't frown, Walter.

517
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:23,469
Here's the house. Right...

518
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:28,476
Okay, here, stop. Right here.

519
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:39,950
When was the last time
you saw these people?

520
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:42,071
About six years.

521
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:43,754
Listen to me.

522
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:46,679
Listen. Listen to me.

523
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:49,953
You absolutely sure this is the house?

524
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,071
Absolutely.

525
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:55,672
Jesus!

526
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:11,474
Hey! Stop! Get out of there!
Come here a minute!

527
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,272
Your beautiful car.

528
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:31,072
Look at the bright side.
What the hell else could happen?

529
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:40,875
- Nadia, just stay out of this.
- Shut up, bitch!

530
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,479
Your wallet.

531
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:48,149
- Oh, shit! The cops!
- Drop the gun!

532
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:55,391
There was three girls.

533
00:45:55,600 --> 00:46:00,230
One of the girls put a gun to my head!
She had a knife in my crotch!

534
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:03,079
Get out of the freaking car!

535
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:06,158
One had red hair standing straight up.

536
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:10,069
Both had leather jackets,
and one had a big tattoo!

537
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:15,674
How much did you drink tonight, sir?

538
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:39,468
Good.

539
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,473
Head back.

540
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:43,712
Eyes closed.

541
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,717
Arms out.

542
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,638
Palms up.

543
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:51,196
With your left hand,
touch the tip of your nose.

544
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:52,909
Good.

545
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:55,076
Now the other hand.

546
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,760
Now, keep your eyes closed.

547
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:03,669
Raise your right foot
eight inches for 10 seconds.

548
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:17,479
God, I feel horrible.

549
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:20,680
Dare I hope that you sobered up?

550
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,589
Oh, I drank. I drank so much.

551
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,472
Yes, you did.

552
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:32,068
And the dinner party... Oh, God.

553
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:35,078
- Walter, I'm so sorry.
- Well...

554
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:38,074
...I know I feel a lot better now.

555
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:45,915
I just have this chemical imbalance.

556
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:51,148
It's like an allergy to alcohol.
It makes me crazy, that's all.

557
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,228
Is that so?

558
00:47:55,240 --> 00:48:00,075
Look, Walter, I know you hate me.
So just listen.

559
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:03,672
Take me to my friend Cathy's house.

560
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:08,557
I know the address.
I won't ever bother you again.

561
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:15,071
I'll kill you!

562
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:16,474
Great!

563
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:20,070
- I thought we'd lost him!
- What fun would that be?

564
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:23,392
- David!
- Hold the tray!

565
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:37,159
You son of a bitch! You wanna play?
Fine, I'll kill you!

566
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:52,159
Actually, if you'll just
drop me off at the nearest hotel...

567
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:56,911
- And end this glorious evening?
- I told you I was sorry.

568
00:48:57,120 --> 00:49:00,715
It's barely midnight.
Don't you wanna boogie down?

569
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:04,277
Dance all night? Tear up the town?

570
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:07,991
I just wanna lie down
in a nice, cool place.

571
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:11,078
I just remembered! There's a party!

572
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:15,273
I know somebody mentioned
a party at Elm and East Hill.

573
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:18,358
I don't wanna go to a party anymore.

574
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:22,833
My friends are nice, quiet people.
They'll bore you.

575
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:26,191
We'll just have to
liven them up, won't we?

576
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:37,071
Seen some traffic, pal?

577
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:41,714
- Walter, listen to me.
- What?

578
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:43,871
Party pooper.

579
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:50,274
- Please, Walter.
- This is great.

580
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:58,437
- How are you?
- Walter Davis, rocket scientist.

581
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,672
I'm thirsty.

582
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:03,279
Thank you.

583
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:05,869
Walter Davis, gynaecologist.

584
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:12,274
- I know these people.
- Great! Let's mingle.

585
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,476
You can't juggle pâté.

586
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:29,115
Oh, my God!

587
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:33,108
- You came after all.
- Walter Davis, interior decorator.

588
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:38,110
- Did you do the Leland house?
- We did the upstairs in '60's kitsch.

589
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:42,677
- Beanbag chairs, lava lamps. Amazing.
- We have to go there now.

590
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:45,075
That's a great suit, Grant.

591
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:57,076
106 at the Forum,
24 seconds left in the game.

592
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:00,670
Lakers down by one.
Magic pumps, shoots.

593
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:04,633
Lakers win in overtime, folks!

594
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:06,398
Boston fans?

595
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:08,875
Do I hear a mambo?

596
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:10,388
Come on, Nadia.

597
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:15,874
It's mambo time!

598
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:20,671
Listen to me!

599
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:27,879
Come and dance with me, darling.

600
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:39,069
Walter Davis, brain surgeon.

601
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:42,673
Walter Davis, mambo king!

602
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:48,549
- Mambo with me, darling!
- Would you care for another...

603
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:55,076
I hope Walter and Nadia
are having a good time.

604
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:04,308
You lie down in a quiet room,
and I'll call a cab.

605
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:08,672
What is all this? I thought
you were Ms. Party-All-Night.

606
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:11,269
This is a great fucking party!

607
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:15,669
You'll thank me in the morning.

608
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:21,392
Let's do it.

609
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:26,590
Let's do it in the coats!
Right here in the fur coats, honey.

610
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:31,716
Why don't you do now what you're
going to do later anyway?

611
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,479
Just pass out.

612
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:36,269
Come to me, baby!

613
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:48,756
Nadia, my little minx.
You've come back to me.

614
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:52,277
You can't get rid of me that easily.

615
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,471
I'm gonna rip your head off!

616
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:06,518
So I take her to my house,
watch a movie, kicking back.

617
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:08,671
She's about this tall.

618
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,871
Sort of like that one.

619
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:15,469
Can I help you?

620
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:19,070
I need my suitcase out of here.
I called a cab.

621
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:29,315
- I wanna talk to you!
- Hey, go call somebody.

622
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:31,875
I'm gonna freaking kill you!

623
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:36,679
Get up, you big...

624
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,078
Call them!

625
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:51,992
- Walter, no!
- Shut up!

626
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:53,997
- I'm not worth it.
- Shut up!

627
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:55,349
- Dance!
- What?

628
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:57,118
I said dance, scumbag!

629
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:03,389
Moonwalk!

630
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:09,719
I hate that shit!

631
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:14,077
He's got a gun!

632
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:29,476
Step up to the line, sir.

633
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:35,959
Hands over your head.

634
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:39,080
Straighten up. Look straight ahead.

635
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:51,679
Here. You're allowed two phone calls.

636
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:04,958
My brother was just
in a serious accident. I...

637
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:09,278
- What do you drive? I have a car...
- Have a nice day.

638
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:29,869
Buckle up, Walter.
You're in enough trouble.

639
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:32,477
It's the law!

640
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:37,479
Home?

641
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:42,876
I warned you not to let her drink.

642
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:50,559
You'd better get a good lawyer
or you'll go to jail for a long time.

643
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:56,473
You're lucky you didn't kill anybody.

644
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:03,874
Bad hangover?

645
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:08,670
Serves you right.

646
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:11,878
New car?

647
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:18,679
God!

648
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:29,878
- Sorry about your car.
- Just get out.

649
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:38,594
- Thanks for bailing me out.
- I didn't bail you out.

650
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:47,831
- Teddy, what did you say?
- I said I didn't bail you out.

651
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:50,190
- Well, who did?
- Nadia.

652
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:52,874
What?! Wait a second!

653
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:06,517
- You smashed my rear window!
- Where is she?

654
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:11,475
- For chrissakes, she's staying with us!
- I want you to take me to her.

655
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:24,752
- She didn't go to her friend's.
- Where is she?

656
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:26,393
It's only 7:30!

657
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:30,070
- I'm feeling sick again.
- She's in the guest room.

658
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:33,033
- What is it?
- He wants to talk to Nadia.

659
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:37,279
- But it's only 7:30.
- Look, Walter's out of control.

660
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:16,078
Can you hear me?

661
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:20,071
- Yes. Who are you?
- It's Walter.

662
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:26,117
Walter, are you dead?
God, you look dead.

663
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:29,073
How much do I owe you for my bail?

664
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:34,676
I don't wanna be obligated
to you for anything.

665
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:39,955
Tell me how much I owe you.
I'll go home and write you a check.

666
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:44,073
- Can we discuss this later?
- I don't have much time.

667
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:47,194
- Don't shout.
- I wasn't shouting.

668
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:52,076
I know. I thought you were going to,
and I couldn't stand it.

669
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:01,350
I go to court a week from this Friday.

670
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:05,030
After that, I'm told
I'll probably go to jail...

671
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:06,912
...for at least two years.

672
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:11,557
I'd rather kill myself
than have you visit me in jail.

673
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:14,035
So tell me how much I owe you...

674
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:17,471
...and then I never
wanna see you again.

675
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:31,477
Ten thousand dollars!

676
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:39,077
Now get out of here,
you ungrateful monster.

677
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:40,759
Ungrateful?

678
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:42,871
I'm ungrateful?

679
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:48,033
I should be grateful after
what you did to me last night?

680
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:51,038
After what I did?
What did I do to you?

681
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:54,277
You did a lot of things,
to a lot of people.

682
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:58,519
I just happened to be a part of it.
A big part, I recall.

683
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:01,757
- You got me drunk.
- I didn't get you drunk.

684
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:05,873
- You bought the champagne.
- You didn't have to drink it!

685
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:09,914
That's a cheap shot, Walter.
A real cheap shot.

686
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:13,829
I drank it because you
seemed sweet and generous.

687
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:16,679
Somebody I could fall in love with.

688
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:23,273
I thought you were special.
I really did.

689
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:25,795
I'm sorry you got fired.

690
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:30,551
I'm sorry you got arrested.
But you know why I'm most sorry?

691
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:33,354
I'm sorry that you're not so special.

692
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:36,552
That you're mean and self-pitying...

693
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:40,116
...and that you don't give
a damn about how I feel.

694
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:42,880
And I feel shitty, Walter!

695
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:49,318
Oh, God.

696
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:59,876
Where you going?

697
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:03,670
Want me to drive...? You want a cab?

698
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:12,359
You're right.

699
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:16,155
Without a great lawyer,
he'll probably go to prison.

700
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:19,278
He's planning on defending himself.

701
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:22,675
He'll definitely go to prison.

702
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:27,832
Will you defend him?

703
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:30,278
Why would I do that?

704
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:34,675
Because you're greatly responsible,
that's why.

705
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:40,669
You do have a point.
I am greatly responsible.

706
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:42,709
Not good enough.

707
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:48,069
If you do, I'll live with you.

708
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:52,475
Still not good enough.

709
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:57,315
- Okay. Goodbye.
- I'll defend him on one condition.

710
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:59,078
What's that?

711
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:02,351
Marry me.

712
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:08,592
I feel guilty about what I did
to Walter, but not that guilty.

713
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:13,715
Possession of an illegal firearm.
Assault with intent to commit murder.

714
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:16,354
Ten years, minimum.

715
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:35,309
- Yes, Lupa.
- <i>Miss Gates wishes to see you again.</i>

716
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:37,954
- Have her wait.
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

717
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:46,070
You should know this up front.

718
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:50,952
I don't like you anymore.
And I certainly don't love you.

719
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:52,878
I don't blame you.

720
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:56,118
Do we have to have sex?

721
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:04,954
But no kissing.

722
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:14,439
All rise. Court is now in session.
Judge Harold Bedford presiding.

723
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:16,189
Be seated.

724
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:23,632
Mr. Walter Davis.

725
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:30,149
Thank you. Yes, Your Honour.

726
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:35,309
I understand you refuse
to be represented by counsel.

727
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:36,635
That's correct.

728
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:40,794
Are you suicidal, Mr. Davis,
or just plain stupid?

729
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:44,952
Probably a bit of both, sir.
Your Honour.

730
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:46,559
I see.

731
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:50,952
Mr. Davis, it would be a humongous
understatement to tell you...

732
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:54,596
...how passionately I disapprove
of your actions.

733
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:58,031
In fact, I'd be equally
critical of a physician...

734
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:02,552
...planning to perform
brain surgery on himself.

735
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:06,589
- Yes, Your Honour.
- "Yes, Your Honour" doesn't do it.

736
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:10,349
Let the public defender
handle your case.

737
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:14,155
- That won't be necessary, Your Honour.
- Oh, shit.

738
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:20,919
- Sorry I'm late. I got it from here.
- Mr. Davis, would you explain this?

739
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:23,714
I'll represent Mr. Davis, Your Honour.

740
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:28,277
I was speaking to Mr. Davis!
I was under the impression...

741
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:32,473
- What are you doing?
- I'm doing this as a favour to Nadia.

742
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:36,992
- Ensuring I go to the gas chamber?
- If you're not calm, I can't help.

743
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:42,228
- Please don't let this man help me!
- Order in the court!

744
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:48,315
One more outburst,
and I'll hold you in contempt.

745
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:54,355
- You all right, Agnes?
- Yes, Your Honour, I'm all right.

746
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:59,950
Will counsel please
approach the bench?

747
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:02,758
Hey! Your...

748
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:04,188
This is...

749
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:08,198
What the hell's going on?

750
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:12,559
Not complicated. I decided
he shouldn't defend himself.

751
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:16,150
- Bullshit. What's on your face?
- I was in a fight.

752
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:18,749
- With whom?
- Mr. Davis.

753
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:23,674
- I don't want complications.
- Since when?

754
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:25,957
I offer you a proposition.

755
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:29,835
- If you find my defendant innocent...
- Stop.

756
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:34,114
You're crazy, trying to bribe
a superior court judge.

757
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:37,551
I'll stop practising law
in your jurisdiction.

758
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:42,196
- I don't believe you.
- I swear on Mother's grave.

759
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:46,313
- Your mom's playing golf at Bel Air.
- I meant future tense.

760
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:51,719
- Go out of state. Say, Alaska?
- My heart's set on somewhere tropical.

761
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:55,799
- Change your name.
- Not practical. I'm getting married.

762
01:05:56,080 --> 01:06:00,232
You could honeymoon for
five or six years. All expenses paid.

763
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:04,035
- I don't think that would...
- I won't press my luck.

764
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:06,800
- One more thing.
- I knew it.

765
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:11,755
The wedding's at your house.
Invite all your influential friends.

766
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:16,556
If I practice law in another state,
I want to drop some big names.

767
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:18,671
- Anything else?
- That's it.

768
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:23,637
I'll be breaking the law for
the first time, but it's worth it.

769
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:26,188
Thanks, Dad.

770
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:30,558
- Jesus.
- Sorry, Your Honour.

771
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:37,070
What did you tell him? What?

772
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:41,751
You can't railroad me into jail
so you can have a shot at Nadia!

773
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:44,428
- Quiet!
- Don't believe him! He's crazy!

774
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:47,154
- He's trying to steal my girl!
- Order!

775
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:50,909
Order in the goddamn court!
Sorry, Agnes.

776
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:55,994
I find the defendant not guilty.
Case dismissed.

777
01:06:56,440 --> 01:07:01,355
- Take a 20-minute recess.
- All rise. Twenty-minute recess.

778
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:03,357
Congratulations.

779
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:06,952
- What happened?
- You're a free man.

780
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:11,558
- Now you can congratulate me.
- What for?

781
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:14,559
Nadia and I are getting married.

782
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:18,153
And you're the one
who made it possible.

783
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:28,198
- Where's Nadia?
- Baton Rouge, telling her mom.

784
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:33,599
In the last few days my reality
has been tested to the limits, but...

785
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:37,156
- Telling her mom what?
- She said to give you this.

786
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:46,638
You are so lucky.
Why are you so unhappy?

787
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:49,752
You guys go ahead.
I'm gonna walk a while.

788
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:57,151
<i>"Dearest Walter:</i>

789
01:07:57,920 --> 01:07:59,956
<i>You may not believe it...</i>

790
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:03,436
<i>... but I am sorry</i>

791
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:07,599
<i>I hope someday you'll find it</i>

<i>You're a special person, Walter,</i>

793
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:14,558
<i>Love, Nadia.</i>

794
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:18,869
<i>Oh, P.S. I hope you start</i>

795
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:45,110
- <i>Hello.</i>
- <i>Susie, it's Nadia.</i>

796
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:49,393
- <i>Hi, where are you?</i>
- <i>Still in Baton Rouge. How's Walter?</i>

797
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:55,118
<i>He seemed pretty good</i>
<i>when I talked to him on the phone.</i>

798
01:08:55,320 --> 01:08:58,835
<i>He asked about you.</i>
<i>I told him you were...</i>

799
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:02,919
- <i>... deliriously happy. Did I lie?</i>
- <i>No.</i>

800
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:08,194
Oh, honey. Just get out of this thing.
You're just gonna ruin your life.

801
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:12,115
<i>I can't. I know it sounds crazy,</i>
<i>but I made a deal.</i>

802
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:15,357
<i>Look, I'll call you</i>
<i>when I get in. Bye.</i>

803
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:17,835
- Who's that?
- It's Nadia.

804
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:19,553
How is she?

805
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:22,755
She's deliriously happy.

806
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:41,434
- What is it, darling?
- Air.

807
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:44,598
The air here's so wonderful.
I just love it.

808
01:09:55,160 --> 01:09:57,230
What, no merry-go-round?

809
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:00,557
You promised David
a first-class wedding.

810
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:05,192
- A wedding, not Disney World.
- Don't be a shitheel, Harold.

811
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:08,517
Your only son doesn't
get married every day.

812
01:10:08,720 --> 01:10:12,633
He's your son too.
It's time you take half the blame.

813
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:16,753
- Mom! Dad!
- See? He even gives you top billing.

814
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:22,552
Your soon-to-be daughter-in-law.

815
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:24,239
- Hello.
- How do you do?

816
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:28,149
- Well, let me show you to your room.
- Okay, fine.

817
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:33,277
What do you think?

818
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:36,597
She isn't at all
what I thought she'd be.

819
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:38,910
What did you think she'd be?

820
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:40,758
Blind.

821
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:48,715
- Plan to have children?
- Naturally.

822
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:52,515
- I know what to get you for a present.
- What's that?

823
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:54,358
A vasectomy.

824
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:11,512
The house is far too large
for us without David here...

825
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:15,599
...but we're so emotionally attached.
We bought it in 1953...

826
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:18,758
...the year after
Harold became a judge.

827
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:22,158
- It's lovely.
- Thank you, my dear.

828
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:25,558
Where are you and David
planning on living?

829
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:31,839
We haven't really decided yet.
I think David likes San Francisco.

830
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:37,319
I thought you had in mind
something more tropical.

831
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:42,435
We really haven't decided on
a place yet. Miami, maybe. Honolulu.

832
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:46,633
- I understand you're from the South?
- Louisiana.

833
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:51,550
I love the South. I played
the front nine at Augusta once.

834
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:55,350
- Did you let Rambo out?
- Yes, sir.

835
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,958
Jesus Christ.
Good doggie. Nice doggie.

836
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:05,953
Oh, shit.

837
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:11,751
She's lovely.

838
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,558
And bright.

839
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:20,272
To marry him,
she must have a screw loose.

840
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:25,154
What is that dog barking about?

841
01:12:29,320 --> 01:12:30,309
Jordan.

842
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:50,192
Rambo! Shut up!

843
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:53,552
You'll wake up
the whole neighbourhood!

844
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:30,078
- Rambo!
- Jordan!

845
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:32,555
- Yes, sir?
- What's with that dog?

846
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:35,479
- I don't know, sir.
- Do something!

847
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:39,754
Come here, Rambo.
What the hell's got into you?

848
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:45,235
Stop that! You keep quiet
or I'll call the vet...

849
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:50,150
...and he'll cut them off
and you'll bark like Cyndi Lauper.

850
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:53,793
Help!

851
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:56,111
Somebody open the door!

852
01:14:10,160 --> 01:14:11,559
Rambo, shut up!

853
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:15,799
- Rambo, shut up!
- Jordan, shut up!

854
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:17,758
Come on, Rambo.

855
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:23,999
I want you to be quiet, you hear me?

856
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:27,549
What the hell are you doing?

857
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:30,558
Planting corn!
What the hell do you think?

858
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:42,998
I can't stand him. He's an idiot.

859
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:46,198
Let's go back to bed
and forget him, okay?

860
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:49,153
Maybe if we think hard, he'll go away.

861
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:52,158
If he leaves me this house,
I'll sell it.

862
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:54,158
Tomorrow, yes.

863
01:14:58,440 --> 01:14:59,759
Good night.

864
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:02,392
Miserable mutt!

865
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:05,114
Would you like some hot cocoa?

866
01:15:05,320 --> 01:15:09,393
Rambo can protect us
when the neighbours try to lynch us.

867
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:51,110
I'm gonna kill that damn dog.

868
01:15:57,720 --> 01:15:59,551
What the hell was that?

869
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:08,959
Oh, it must have been the wind.

870
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:11,756
There's no wind.

871
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:14,278
- What?
- What?

872
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,353
Great.

873
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:25,950
Darling, my door's locked.
I guess the wind...

874
01:16:26,240 --> 01:16:28,151
David, it won't work.

875
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:29,509
Now good night!

876
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:34,759
Great.

877
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:05,871
<i>Here's Johnny!</i>

878
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:24,798
You all right, Agnes?

879
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:35,394
Look at me!
I'll have to take another shower.

880
01:17:35,640 --> 01:17:37,949
I hate this! Jesus!

881
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:40,353
Walter?

882
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:12,150
It's not funny, David.

883
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:18,956
Jesus.

884
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,355
Plant seeds in my pocket.

885
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,150
Great. I'm filthy.

886
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:01,954
Why, what did you do that for?

887
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:14,039
There you are, you filthy beast.
How did you get out?

888
01:19:14,240 --> 01:19:17,755
Right. Come on.
Back in the pen you go.

889
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:26,155
You gonna move or aren't you?

890
01:19:58,240 --> 01:20:00,629
- What's that?
- It's for Miss Gates.

891
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:02,353
I'll take it.

892
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:06,359
Why's he so happy?

893
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:11,190
Hard to say. Last time he acted
like that, he'd run over the cat.

894
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:25,557
Hello. Good morning.

895
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:30,151
- You look very happy, David.
- So do you, darling.

896
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:32,954
This is for you.

897
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:39,559
Love you!

898
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:35,039
Nadia, do you mind
if I eat this last chocolate?

899
01:21:35,240 --> 01:21:36,958
Sure, Mama.

900
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:41,948
These are filled with brandy.

901
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:48,229
You didn't eat this whole box?

902
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:49,953
I didn't?

903
01:22:12,720 --> 01:22:15,188
Shut up. Shut up!

904
01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:00,314
Dearly beloved...

905
01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:03,876
...we are gathered here
in this beautiful home...

906
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:05,957
...on this beautiful day...

907
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:09,596
...to witness the uniting
of two beautiful souls...

908
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:11,631
...in holy wedlock.

909
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:14,308
Marriage is a sacred commitment...

910
01:23:14,520 --> 01:23:18,433
...designed on Earth
and sanctified in heaven.

911
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:21,154
Without the institution
of marriage...

912
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:24,193
...mankind would still be
in the Dark Ages.

913
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:27,631
Consider the marriage symbol,
the wedding ring.

914
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:30,718
A perfect circle,
without beginning or end...

915
01:23:30,920 --> 01:23:33,798
...signifying God's
eternal love and devotion.

916
01:23:34,280 --> 01:23:37,955
For where would we be
without God's love?

917
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:48,389
Cheap shoes.

918
01:23:50,160 --> 01:23:51,673
You all right, Agnes?

919
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:58,431
And let us be ever mindful
of the consequences of our acts.

920
01:23:58,640 --> 01:24:00,551
God is watching.

921
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,753
Oh, Lord, she did eat them all.

922
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:06,958
Have you been drinking?

923
01:24:09,200 --> 01:24:10,679
The time has come...

924
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:14,350
...for David and Nadia
to make this commitment.

925
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:18,314
Do you, David,
take Nadia to be your wife?

926
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:21,956
- I haven't finished. To have and to...
- I do.

927
01:24:22,160 --> 01:24:25,436
- In sickness and health,
till death do you part?

928
01:24:25,640 --> 01:24:27,995
- Do you, Nadia, take David...
- Wait.

929
01:24:28,200 --> 01:24:30,953
Is it indelicate
to ask what's going on?

930
01:24:31,160 --> 01:24:34,789
- I don't love your son.
- Me neither. What's your point?

931
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:38,675
- Take deep breaths.
- Screw the guests!

932
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:43,954
- This will take time. Have champagne.
- I know we had a bargain.

933
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:47,152
- Play some music, and kill the dog!
- Honey...

934
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:49,991
What's this about a bargain?

935
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:53,158
People shouldn't marry
because of a bargain.

936
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:55,034
Would you just...

937
01:24:55,200 --> 01:24:57,555
Come back here and finish this!

938
01:24:59,320 --> 01:25:01,356
Stop the music!

939
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:09,752
Ladies and gentlemen,
maybe you can help me with this one.

940
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:14,552
Say two people are gonna be married...

941
01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:17,674
...and one doesn't love the other one.

942
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:21,597
The other only thinks
he loves the other one...

943
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:24,951
...because the other one
really loves another.

944
01:25:25,160 --> 01:25:26,513
Are you with me?

945
01:25:29,080 --> 01:25:32,959
If two people don't love each other
should they get married?

946
01:25:33,640 --> 01:25:35,153
There you go.

947
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:39,439
- If one adored the other one...
- But she didn't love him!

948
01:25:39,640 --> 01:25:42,791
...would die for her,
she'd learn to love him.

949
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:47,039
But she loves another man
and would always think of him.

950
01:25:47,240 --> 01:25:50,755
- Not if he's dead! Not now, Father!
- Would any of you...

951
01:25:52,040 --> 01:25:54,554
Hold it. Hold it.

952
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:58,589
The only way to get this resolved
is to take a vote.

953
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:01,394
All those in favour
of Nadia and David...

954
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:05,149
...not getting married, say "aye."

955
01:26:50,160 --> 01:26:52,628
Nadia! Get your mouth away from him!

956
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:56,515
Listen to me! Nadia!
Get your hands off of him!

957
01:31:16,200 --> 01:31:17,189
