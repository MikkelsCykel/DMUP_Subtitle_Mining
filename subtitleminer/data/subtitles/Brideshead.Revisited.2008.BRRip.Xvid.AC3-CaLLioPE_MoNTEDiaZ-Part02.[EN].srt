00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,970
When you see him,

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:05,010
tell him I'm still here.

3
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:13,410
Your friend
has got the grippe.

4
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:17,730
One of his lungs is full of fluid.

5
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:21,610
He will recover. But travel with you?
Not a chance.

6
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:24,610
He's very weak. No resistance.

7
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:28,490
What do you expect?
He is an alcoholic.

8
00:00:58,130 --> 00:00:59,810
Here is your friend.

9
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:18,210
What the hell are you doing here?

10
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:20,490
Your mother asked me to come.

11
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:23,090
She wants me to bring you back home,

12
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:27,610
but the doctor said
it's out of the question for you to travel.

13
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:29,930
I wouldn't, even if I could.

14
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:32,050
I think...

15
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:36,210
I think she's dying.

16
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:47,490
Walk with me. I'm meant to exercise.

17
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:08,290
Did you go to my house?

18
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,250
Did you meet Kurt?

19
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:13,570
Yes.

20
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:18,290
He wanted you to know
he was waiting for you.

21
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:21,570
It's rather a pleasant change,

22
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:26,050
when all your life
you've had people looking after you,

23
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:29,170
to have someone to look after, yourself.

24
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:45,050
I thought you'd want to go back
to Brideshead one day.

25
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:46,530
Brideshead?

26
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:48,490
Are you mad?

27
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:52,810
The place would still be full of her.

28
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:57,930
I wouldn't go within
a hundred miles of the place.

29
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,730
I need to sit.

30
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:18,970
I'm sorry.

31
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:21,250
Whatever for?

32
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:32,290
Everything.

33
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:34,770
It's all right.

34
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:37,570
Truly.

35
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,210
I asked too much of you.

36
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:46,770
I knew it all along, really.

37
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:51,450
Only God can give you that sort of love.

38
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:00,690
Come home, Sebastian.

39
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:04,770
When you're well enough.

40
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,290
Don't finish it like this.

41
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:13,210
This is my life now.

42
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:17,050
I'm happy here.

43
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:23,250
I miss you.

44
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:27,770
How sweet of you to say that.

45
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:31,890
Dear Charles,

46
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:38,250
it was my fault for
bringing you to Brideshead.

47
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:44,850
Run away.

48
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:49,530
Run far away and don't ever look back.

49
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,610
I'm sorry.

50
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:11,250
You must be so proud of him.

51
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,970
- Was he away long?
- Two years,

52
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:15,690
and it doesn't feel like a day.

53
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:05,510
Hello, Charles.

54
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:14,910
Did you know I was on the boat?

55
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:19,350
If I said no, you wouldn't believe me.

56
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,550
You're married now.

57
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:28,670
Yes.

58
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:37,430
- You haven't changed at all.
- Neither have you.

59
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:44,430
- How ridiculous.
- Yes, isn't it?

60
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,950
Tell me this is fate.

61
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,870
- What?
- Nothing.

62
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:15,590
Tell me.

63
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:18,670
I was thinking about Sebastian.

64
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:22,350
Mummy died without
ever seeing him again.

65
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:27,350
I know.

66
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,590
Let's go up on deck.

67
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:37,310
- Are you sure?
- They're all asleep! Come on!

68
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:42,030
Come on!

69
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:53,790
Sorry.

70
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:00,510
- So where's Rex?
- I drowned him.

71
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:02,790
Forgive me, Rex!

72
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:18,350
Lady Julia, fancy meeting you here.

73
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:20,990
- Mr. Ryder.
- Could I possibly get you a drink?

74
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:22,230
Dry martini, please.

75
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:24,510
One dry Martini,
one whiskey with water.

76
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:26,150
Please, allow me.

77
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:37,350
So, why did you marry Rex?

78
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:40,270
I don't know. Because he wasn't you.

79
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:43,670
- Because he was rich.
- Because he was Catholic.

80
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:46,750
Because Mummy approved,
God rest her soul.

81
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,510
I thought he was my painted savage.

82
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:55,350
It turns out he was
thoroughly up to date.

83
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,550
Thank you.

84
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:01,510
Now, no more talk about Rex.
He's in England.

85
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:12,910
- Do you have children?
- No.

86
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:15,430
No.

87
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:21,830
- What will you tell your wife?
- Wait until London.

88
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:27,070
I have a viewing to arrange.
I'll sort it out. It'll be fine.

89
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:30,710
- Where shall we go?
- Somewhere abroad, like Daddy.

90
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,550
- What about Italy? Capri?
- Antibes.

91
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:34,550
- Seville.
- Verona.

92
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:36,310
- Paris.
- Brideshead.

93
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:38,190
- No!
- Why not?

94
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:42,310
- It's the loveliest place on earth.
- I can't go back there.

95
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:44,110
- Not after this.
- Nonsense.

96
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:46,790
- We've nothing to apologize for.
- No.

97
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:50,310
Besides, Rex is there.

98
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:53,310
Leave it to me.
I'll settle things with Rex.

99
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:56,190
I'll settle everything.

100
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:00,790
Trust me.

101
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:03,110
I do.

102
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:06,270
- And stop worrying!
- I will.

103
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,870
Good afternoon, ma'am.
- Lovely day.

104
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,390
Mr. and Mrs. Ryder.

105
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:33,230
Look, that's the Duke
and Duchess of Clarence.

106
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,950
- They want to buy one!
- How very gracious of them.

107
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:43,550
Make an effort, Charles.
I've got you the cream of Mayfair.

108
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:48,350
Mrs. Ryder, good day.

109
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:51,790
Charles, how charming you look.

110
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:55,990
Anthony.

111
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:59,510
I heard, quite by chance, at a luncheon,
that you were having an exhibition.

112
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:03,390
So, of course, I dashed impetuously
to the shrine to pay homage.

113
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,590
Where are the pictures?

114
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:09,190
Let me explain them to you.

115
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:21,070
This is simply charm.

116
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:25,470
Simple, creamy, English charm,
playing tigers.

117
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:30,190
But enough of art.

118
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:34,230
They tell me you are happy in love
and that is everything, isn't it?

119
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:36,270
Or nearly everything.

120
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:39,630
Everyone's talking about it.

121
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:43,030
So, it's Julia now.
And it used to be Sebastian.

122
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:46,430
Do you think I should warn her?

123
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:48,590
Warn her about what?

124
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:53,830
How apropos that you'd have
chosen jungles for your canvas.

125
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:58,590
I always thought you
were the lamb to be slaughtered,

126
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:01,390
when all along it is they
who are hunted.

127
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:07,190
There really is no end to your hunger,
is there, Charles?

128
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:27,470
Why do I feel so nervous?
- Don't be.

129
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:37,070
- Who are all these people?
- Politicians, money men.

130
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,510
Rex thinks there's a war
coming with Hitler.

131
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:41,230
He wants to do well out of it.

132
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:43,950
- It's all he talks about.
- Hello, Julia.

133
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:46,070
- Hello, Rex.
- Good evening, Rex.

134
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:48,550
Mr. Ryder,
welcome back to Brideshead.

135
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:51,110
I hear you're making
quite a name for yourself.

136
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:54,430
- Could I have a word with you?
- Later, I have guests.

137
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:02,110
It's cold.

138
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,560
Not here!

139
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,480
- Sorry.
- Let's go back to London.

140
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,080
- Let me settle everything with Rex.
- And then we'll leave?

141
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,400
- Yes? Charles?
- Yes.

142
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,960
If that's what you want.

143
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,960
Hello, Bridey.

144
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,880
- Hello, Julia. Just up from London?
- Yes.

145
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,760
Welcome back to Brideshead, Charles.

146
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,520
- How's your family?
- Fine, thank you.

147
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,440
- Rex still entertaining?
- He's got business.

148
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,760
I'm sorry he's not here.
I have a little announcement to make.

149
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,680
Well, come on. Out with it.

150
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:05,120
- I'm engaged to be married.
- Congratulations, Bridey.

151
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,680
Well, who is she?

152
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,240
- No one you know.
- Is she pretty?

153
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,680
I don't think you could
exactly call her pretty.

154
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,720
"Comely" is the word
I think of in her connection.

155
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,520
She is a big woman.

156
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,280
- Fat?
- No, big.

157
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,920
She's called Mrs. Muspratt.
Her Christian name is Beryl.

158
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,000
But, Bridey, where did you find her?

159
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:29,720
Her late husband, Admiral Muspratt,
collected matchboxes.

160
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,400
You're not marrying her
for her matchboxes, are you, Bridey?

161
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,640
No, no.

162
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,960
Matchboxes were left
to Falmouth Town Library.

163
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,560
I'm just holding them for collection.
Why are you laughing?

164
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,800
- I hope you'll be very happy.
- Thank you.

165
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,600
- I think I'm very fortunate.
- You sly, old thing.

166
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,720
When are we going to meet her?
You must bring her here.

167
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,440
- I couldn't do that.
- Why not?

168
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,560
Well, you must understand,

169
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,400
Beryl is a woman
of strict Catholic principle,

170
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,600
fortified by the prejudices
of the middle classes.

171
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,080
I couldn't possibly bring her here.

172
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,920
I don't understand.

173
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,360
It may be a matter of indifference
to you,

174
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,360
whether or not you choose
to live in sin with Charles,

175
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,760
but on no account would Beryl
consent to be your guest.

176
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,720
How dare you talk to her like that?

177
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,360
Bloody offensive thing to say!

178
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,880
Really, there was nothing
she could object to.

179
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,920
I was merely stating
a fact well known to her.

180
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,440
Take no notice of him, my darling.

181
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,160
So,

182
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,200
got you. Sorry about the delay.

183
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,880
I'll be outside.

184
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,320
The door? Door's made
from all the works of Dickens.

185
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,360
I had it installed especially. Want one?

186
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,960
No, thank you.

187
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,280
I know what you're thinking.

188
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,400
How vulgar can it get?
You wanna know the secret?

189
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,120
I do it on purpose.

190
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:40,440
It amuses me to offend
their delicate sensibilities.

191
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,280
So, you wanna take my wife off me?

192
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,400
You know she can't marry
a divorcé, right?

193
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,680
- Against the rules.
- Well, at least she'll be free of you.

194
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,120
She'll never be free.

195
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,800
Don't pretend
you've been faithful to her.

196
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,560
Who said anything about faith?

197
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:59,600
I bet you'd love to get your hands
on the house, though, wouldn't you?

198
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:03,120
All those pretty paintings.
All those pretty views.

199
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,920
Let her go, Rex. You never loved her.

200
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,080
The only thing you ever had
in common was religion.

201
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,920
Wrong. When I decided to marry Julia,
I wasn't a Catholic.

202
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,200
I converted before the wedding.

203
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,080
Bet she didn't tell you that.

204
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,200
- I guessed.
- Oh, yeah?

205
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,040
You're the type.

206
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,560
You people,

207
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,840
you never learn.

208
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,880
You could have had it all
if you'd been a little more flexible.

209
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,240
I did what I had to do.

210
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,400
They want a Catholic,
I'll convert to Catholicism.

211
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,560
It's a great religion.

212
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:46,160
You sin all you want, then you confess.
Problem solved.

213
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,240
You gotta woo these people.

214
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,480
This family don't live in the real world.

215
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,880
- They're mortgaged up to the hilt.
- Get to the point.

216
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,800
You want my wife? Make me an offer.

217
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,200
- I'm not just giving her away.
- Don't do this. It's demeaning.

218
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,680
Try a little harder.

219
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,560
You're a rich man, Rex,
you've already got what you wanted.

220
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:18,440
You can never have enough
of what you want.

221
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,520
No, you're right.

222
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,760
You're taking her off my hands.
That's a favor.

223
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,240
I'll tell you what I'll do.

224
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:37,000
You give me a couple of your jungle
pics, and I'll give you an annulment.

225
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,400
I hear you're worth collecting.

226
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,520
Come on, Charlie boy, say yes.
You know you want to.

227
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,960
You don't have to speak.

228
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,360
Just nod.

229
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,440
I'll have my driver take me to London.

230
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,320
He can pick up the paintings
in the morning.

231
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:30,320
You know she's mad.
Can't even give you children.

232
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,120
Lost the only one we had.

233
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,880
Julia?

234
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,160
I'm so sorry. I didn't know.

235
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,480
- It's just a shock.
- Shh.

236
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,480
Shh. Don't.

237
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,560
I've always known, ever since nursery.

238
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:32,560
I tried to be good, I really did.
I tried. I married Rex.

239
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:36,320
All through the backgammon
and cigars, I tried.

240
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,880
But it's not enough. It's never enough.

241
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,560
God had to punish me.

242
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:47,080
So he took my little stillborn...

243
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,680
My child. My girl.

244
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,040
With you, I thought I could
really and truly be free.

245
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,840
But coming back here, it's like a thread,

246
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:00,760
an invisible thread drawing you back,
inch by inch,

247
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,400
until all of a sudden,
you're a child again.

248
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,560
And that voice inside your head,

249
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,640
the one that Mummy planted
all those years ago in the nursery,

250
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,560
every night in the nursery,
filling your head with it.

251
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,720
And the voice is telling you,
whispering,

252
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,880
"Wicked little Julia,
bad little girl, living in sin. "

253
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,840
And here I am again with you,
living in sin.

254
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,440
It's over. It's over now.

255
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,640
- Everything set?
- That's everything, sir.

256
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,280
- Thank you, Wilcox.
- Best of luck, sir.

257
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,480
Who's that?

258
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,440
Go back. Turn around.
I have to go back.

259
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,560
- Staff, immediately!
- Yes, sir.

260
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,880
Come on, quickly now!

261
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,400
I'll help with that.

262
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,600
Come on, hurry!
- Yes, sir.

263
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,960
Shall I help, Tompkins?
- Hurry!

264
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:44,240
The sedan chair.
- Right, very gently. Very gently.

265
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,160
Hurry.
- Get a move with the chair.

266
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,160
Come along, come along.

267
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,800
Somebody got the rug?

268
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,480
Up. Gently.

269
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:00,360
Clear the stairs, please.
- Could I have the medical bag?

270
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,960
- Father!
- Dear Julia.

271
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,400
Come on, please. Come on!

272
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,120
I'm sorry, I was to call,

273
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,200
but we have been traveling
without a stop for three days.

274
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,200
It was Cordelia,
she was visiting us in Venice...

275
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,800
What happened?
- We want the bed ready

276
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,040
as soon as possible.

277
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,960
His heart. Some long word at the heart.

278
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,680
Hurry up.

279
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,080
He's dying.

280
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,760
He has come home to die.

281
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,720
Come on, everybody, that's it.
Chop-chop.

282
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,720
Come along.

283
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,120
We must get Lord Marchmain
to the great dining room.

284
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,280
Thank you.

285
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,880
He's sleeping.

286
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,720
Do you think we should
let Sebastian know?

287
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,040
You could, but I doubt he'd come.

288
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:13,520
The last I heard of him,
he was still struggling rather.

289
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,960
The monks have him as a porter
in the hospital in Morocco.

290
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,720
He seems to like it.

291
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,360
I think they've rather taken him
under their wing, dear old thing.

292
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,760
Still, salvation of a sort.

293
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,560
Bridey, you need to call for a priest.

294
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,680
I'll have a word with Father Mackay
about dropping in this evening.

295
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,360
Julia, your father doesn't want a priest.

296
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,280
All he wants is to die in his old home.

297
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:44,440
Our father's soul, all sinners' souls,
face mortal danger.

298
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,480
It is our duty as Catholics
to see that we do all in our power

299
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:51,680
to save those we love from themselves.

300
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,640
Hateful woman.

301
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,480
She wants me dead.

302
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,640
What about you?

303
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,400
- Do you want me dead?
- No.

304
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,960
You know the family
are sending for a priest.

305
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:59,440
They seem determined
to drag God into it.

306
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,480
Why should you care?

307
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,120
You don't believe in God.

308
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,040
You said so yourself.

309
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,640
Have you suddenly
become my conscience?

310
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,520
I've already seen Sebastian
ruined by God.

311
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:22,080
I don't see why I should watch it
happen again with your daughter.

312
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,160
How very caring of you.

313
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,360
You forget, I was there.

314
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,400
I watched that woman crucify my son,

315
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:37,120
little by little, and I was silent.

316
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,480
What does that say about me?

317
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,800
You're not responsible
for what she did.

318
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:47,480
But are we not also
our brother's keeper?

319
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,640
You, Charles, and me?

320
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,800
I let Sebastian down.

321
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,520
I let everyone down.

322
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,400
This way, sir.

323
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,720
Dear, no, that's too many!

324
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,800
- Papa...
- Your father needs to rest!

325
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,000
- Get him away.
- I've brought Father Mackay to see you.

326
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:26,920
- Get him away! Get him away!
- Out!

327
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,400
Everybody out! Out! Out!

328
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:34,760
- I'm so sorry, Father.
- Not at all. Give him time.

329
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,840
I've known worse cases
make beautiful deaths.

330
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,560
What were you talking
to my father about?

331
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,400
He doesn't want a priest.

332
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,080
Please, Charles.

333
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,600
Please don't interfere with matters
that don't concern you.

334
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,960
Julia...

335
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,760
Let's get out of here.

336
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,520
We'll go to Italy.

337
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,800
- Capri.
- I can't leave now, my father's dying.

338
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:15,520
When this is over,
I can make you happy.

339
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:33,360
- Why should I believe you?
- Believe me.

340
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,960
You just bought me from Rex.

341
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,120
What are you talking about?

342
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,840
According to you,
I'm worth two pictures.

343
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,960
I thought I'd fetch at least three.

344
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,960
Don't be ridiculous.

345
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,120
- That was Rex.
- You agreed to it, Charles.

346
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,880
- I had no choice!
- You agreed!

347
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,960
I thought I was doing the right thing.

348
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I thought I was doing what you wanted.

349
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,600
No, you thought you were getting me
and the house, together.

350
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:11,320
- Is that really what you think?
- You tell me. Please, tell me.

351
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,920
What does Charles Ryder really want?

352
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,160
Can you imagine what it was like
for me to be invited into Brideshead?

353
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,760
Me,

354
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,160
Charles Ryder,

355
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,000
"the painter from Paddington,"
as your mother so sweetly put it.

356
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,760
There was no humiliation
I would not have endured

357
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,040
just to be part of that dream.

358
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:01,640
And your mother, that woman is more
alive now than she ever was.

359
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:06,160
She's in every brick,
every stone, every slate.

360
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,600
Sebastian was right.

361
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,440
We should run away.

362
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,920
- Why did you bring me here?
- We can still leave.

363
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,440
- Bridey...
- Don't interfere, Charles.

364
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:46,360
Now, try and remember your sins
and tell God you're sorry.

365
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,440
I'm going to give you absolution now.

366
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,240
And while I'm giving it,

367
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,200
I want you to tell God you're sorry
you offended him,

368
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,600
and then I want you
to make a sign, if you can.

369
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,440
- Amen.
- Amen.

370
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,760
Amen.

371
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:58,800
Please, God,
please, if you're there, forgive him.

372
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:03,960
Forgive me. Oh, God, forgive me.
Let him have a sign.

373
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:44,520
Sebastian used to loathe this painting.

374
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:50,400
Daddy gave it to Mummy
as a wedding present.

375
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,160
Tell me.

376
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,240
I wanted too much.

377
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,400
It's nobody's fault.

378
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,880
But you're not coming with me.

379
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,720
I can't shut myself off from His mercy.

380
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,480
Can you understand that?

381
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,640
I don't want to make it easier for you.

382
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,640
I hope your heart

383
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,800
breaks.

384
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,360
But I do understand.

385
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,720
I have to let you go.

386
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:18,520
<i>Whether by fate or the
divine ironies of some higher power,</i>

387
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:23,520
<i>I find myself returned once more
to Brideshead.</i>

388
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,080
Let it go.

389
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:39,280
<i>Did I want too much?</i>

390
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,520
Get him out of my sight!

391
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:47,720
<i>Did my own hunger blind me to
the ties that bound them to their faith?</i>

392
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:55,360
<i>Am I only now, shadowed by war,
all moorings gone,</i>

393
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,160
<i>alone enough to see the light?</i>

394
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,360
Worst place we've struck yet.

395
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,920
No facilities, no amenities,

396
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,680
and the nearest village
is a five-mile walk.

397
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,000
Mind you, there's a rumor
of a big push coming.

398
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,240
They'll be shipping
us off to France soon.

399
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,840
Yes, very soon.

400
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,640
Where are the family now?
Does anyone know?

401
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:26,560
Some Lady Flyte lives
on her own here, normally.

402
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,600
She's overseas
with the women's service.

403
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:32,240
Her elder brother died in the Blitz.
They're all Roman Catholic.

404
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:37,200
- I take it you're not religious, Hooper.
- Me? God, no. Can't see the point in it.

405
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,840
You're born, you live, then you die.

406
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,400
Do you have any hopes
for the future, Hooper?

407
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,400
Hopes? Oh, aye, plenty.

408
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:51,000
It's our time now. You watch.
The old ways, all this, they're gone.

409
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,560
Future belongs to us,
so long as we don't get shot.

410
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,240
How about you, sir?

411
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,080
You got someone
special waiting for you?

412
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,800
Me? No.

413
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:04,880
I've loved and lost
for more than one lifetime.

414
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,560
Would you like me
to drive you back, sir?

415
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,320
No, not yet. Carry on, Hooper.

416
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,280
Very good, sir.

417
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,160
Sergeant!
