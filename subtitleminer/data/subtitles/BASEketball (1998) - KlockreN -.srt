1
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:59,514
...4 runs batted in. And he's already hit
2 home runs tonight.

2
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,955
Reggie!

3
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,591
Just listen to that crowd.
- Reggie!

4
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:12,679
Come on, Reggie! Hit another homerun!
- Coop, he's already hit two.

5
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,793
It's a high fly ball to right...

6
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,673
That's way back

7
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,711
and it's... gone.

8
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,868
Reggie Jackson hits
his 3rd home run of the game.

9
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,716
Good catch, Coop!
- I can't believe it!

10
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,588
I totally had it,
but my glasses slipped.

11
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,199
Remer, someday I'm gonna become
a big sports star. - Whatever you say.

12
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,558
You just watch me, dude.

13
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:58,159
There was a time in America
when contests of athletic prowess

14
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,199
were a metaphor for the nobility of man.

15
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,239
Historic moments,
forged by the love of the game,

16
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,676
celebrated the human potential

17
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:12,029
to achieve excellence. But as time passed
and the country neared the millennium,

18
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,032
something went awry.

19
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:19,195
Manning rolls right. He's got Plough
at the ten... Touchdown,

20
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,828
Dallas.

21
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,878
The ideal of sportsmanship

22
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,751
began to take a back seat
to excessive celebration.

23
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,554
The athletes caring less about playing
than planning the vulgar grandstanding

24
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:45,353
that inevitably followed even the most
pedestrian of accomplishments.

25
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,196
The games became
subordinate to the quest for money.

26
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,709
Stadiums and arenas became no more

27
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,599
than giant billboards

28
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,309
to promote commercial products.

29
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,959
Players sold their services
to the highest bidder,

30
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,318
much like the hired guns
of the Old West.

31
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,316
After playing for New England, San Diego,
Houston, St. Louis,

32
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,508
a year for the Toronto Argonauts,
plus one season at the Desert Inn,

33
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,913
I'm happy to finally play here
in the fine city of Miami.

34
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,193
Minnesota.

35
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,797
Whatever. Shit.

36
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,876
Soon it was commonplace for entire teams
to change in search of greater profits.

37
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,397
The Minneapolis Lakers moved to
Los Angeles, where there are no lakes.

38
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,155
The Oilers moved to Tennessee,
where there's no oil.

39
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,313
The Jazz moved to Salt Lake City
where they don't allow music.

40
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,110
The Oakland Raiders moved to L.A.
And then back to Oakland.

41
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,476
No one in L.A. Seemed to notice.

42
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:50,908
The search for greener pastures went on.
Continued expansion diluted

43
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,550
the talent pool, forcing owners

44
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,599
to recruit heavily from prisons,
mental institutions and Texas.

45
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,912
Fistfighting and brawling

46
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:05,269
overshadowed every athletic competition.
As the problems mounted,

47
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,958
the fans became less and less interested.
To reverse the trend,

48
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:16,310
major sports started interleague play.
Then they tried intersports play.

49
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,669
But no matter how far major sports went,
it wasn't enough

50
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,479
to bring the fans back.

51
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,237
The spirit of athletic competition, though,
indeed was not dead.

52
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:33,792
Its seed merely lay dormant
in the dreams of the young.

53
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,954
You know, Remer, someday
I'm gonna be a big sports star.

54
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:46,352
You know, Remer, someday
I'm gonna own a big sports bar.

55
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,919
Hurry up, Coop.
- I just gotta water the plants.

56
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,430
I don't wanna be with high school losers.

57
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,877
This is Brittany Kaiser's house,
and I really wanna fuck her.

58
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,233
Dr. Kaiser!

59
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,993
Coop and Remer.

60
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,871
We graduated with Brittany.
- You graduated?

61
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,108
Of course we did, cock. Beer?

62
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,233
This place looks like
a "Dockers" commercial. Hey, Stef!

63
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,471
Coop! Remer!

64
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,949
Want a beer?

65
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,069
Oh, my God! You haven't changed at all.

66
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,515
Cool!

67
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,035
No, it isn't.

68
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,273
Cock!

69
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,678
Hey, Skid Mark Steve!
You still hanging out

70
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,550
and playing Nintendo?
- I'm in my 2nd year of med school

71
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,713
and training for the Summer Games.
What're you two up to?

72
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,431
Hanging out, playing Nintendo. Cock.

73
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,314
Hi, Brittany!

74
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,757
Didn't think you guys would show up.

75
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:07,517
We wouldn't miss it. - I don't remember
putting you on the guest list.

76
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,876
Ted told us about it.

77
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,199
Excuse me!

78
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,831
Why did you tell those losers? - Me...

79
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,028
Let's bail. - No, let's go to Brittany's room!

80
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,993
Come in here! Check it out.

81
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,118
Brittany's underwear. - Aw, dude!

82
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,239
Dude!

83
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,511
I am so jealous of you.

84
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,474
Excuse me! - Brittany!

85
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,560
What're you doing in my mom's room?

86
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,269
Get outta here!

87
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,629
Oh, Jesus!

88
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,470
We'll never get her. - Or any chick.

89
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:13,953
We have no jobs, the rent's overdue

90
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,396
and our gas is about to get shut off.

91
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,677
What do girls want anyway?

92
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,111
Apparently, not total losers.
- We're pretty good at basketball.

93
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:30,279
As long as we don't have to run
or jump or dribble.

94
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,672
That shit's overrated anyway.

95
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,392
You guys up for a little game?
- Sure.

96
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,118
Let's make it interesting.

97
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,798
20 bucks? - How about 50? - You're on.

98
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:51,716
Haven't got 50 bucks. - They're no good.

99
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,193
Oh, shit!

100
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,914
We playing or not?

101
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:08,313
But not that pussy ass two-on-two
you guys play in the suburbs.

102
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:14,634
You guys got something better?
- This new game we picked up in the hood.

103
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,870
What is it?

104
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,878
Okay.
I shoot from wherever I want, right?

105
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,078
Then you have to make the same shot,
or else you get a letter.

106
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,034
You mean like "horse"?
- It's not like "horse".

107
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,911
Duh. It's uh...
baseball rules.

108
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,794
A single's
from the freethrow line.

109
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,113
A double's from the top of the key.
- You have to shoot from a different place.

110
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:48,069
A triple's from back here, and a home run's
from behind the meatballs.

111
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,278
You miss, you get an out.
Ready? Break. - What?

112
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,238
We can explain it more slowly,
big sports guys!

113
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,115
No, we get it.

114
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:06,033
Losers up first.
- This is a single, right?

115
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:10,433
And a homerun's behind the meatballs.
- Take your shot, guy!

116
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:18,076
You can't spit beer at me! - I can do
what I want to make you miss your shot!

117
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,634
He's right. That's one out.
- One out? Give me the damn ball!

118
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,874
I fucked your sister.

119
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,990
Coop lines up for a double.
Okay, guys, 2nd and 3rd.

120
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,151
Runner on 3rd. This could bring him home.

121
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,993
Yeah, two outs!

122
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,628
Come on!

123
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,718
Tip-in! Double play, three outs!
- What? - We're up.

124
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,509
That's nice!
- This could almost seal it.

125
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,748
Made that look easy!

126
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,320
One of Brittany's mom's pubic hairs!

127
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,035
Oh, God!

128
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,789
Man! - Dude, we win the game! A sweet
psyche-out. - Here's another one!

129
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,196
We win and they get

130
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,151
the chicks. That sucks, dude.
- We gotta get jobs.

131
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,994
Then we get the khakis.
Then the chicks.

132
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,914
Starting tomorrow
we gotta stop playing games!

133
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,755
Miss it. Steve Perry...

134
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,436
Yes! Three outs. I'm up.
- Bottom of the 5th. - Joseph R. Cooper?

135
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,353
Single! Man on 1st.
- Are you Joe Cooper?

136
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,193
Cut the crap, Squeak. You know me.

137
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,751
This authorizes me to enter
your property and terminate services

138
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,515
until all delinquent payments
have been generated. - What?

139
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,674
He's here to shut off the gas.
- You work for the gas company?

140
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,754
Gentlemen...
- Double! Guy on 2nd and 3rd.

141
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,231
Is your canine locked up
or secured within your domicile?

142
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:15,918
He's getting his claws removed.
- If you'll excuse me.

143
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,835
Does it just suck being you?
- I'll show those guys

144
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,117
what sucks.

145
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,389
Oh yeah, he misses...
- Damn it!

146
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,509
...I'm running outta ideas.
- That's why we have this short shot.

147
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,549
Kind of like a bunt. - Exactly!
Doesn't put any runners on base. - Sweet!

148
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,110
You lied to me! Again!

149
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:50,991
Right. The dog's appointment is tomorrow.
- Honest mistake, Squeak.

150
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,391
My name's not Squeak. It's Kenny!

151
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,678
Alright, you little bitch.
Take a shot!

152
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,956
No, I wanna turn off your gas.
And don't call me bitch!

153
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,157
Okay, Squeak, let's just shoot for it.

154
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:09,633
What? Are you insane?
This is my job, you assholes!

155
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,873
All you gotta do
is make a single from here,

156
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:16,556
and you can shut off our gas, and
we'll never call you Squeak again.

157
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,154
Or bitch.

158
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,869
Or bitch.

159
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,559
From here?

160
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,955
Alright. Check this shit out!

161
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,753
Tough break, Squeak.
Now you gotta fetch the ball, bitch.

162
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,190
Three months later

163
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,359
We can win the game with this one.
Bring me home.

164
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,194
We win the game!

165
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,438
We got 5 runs that inning.

166
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,432
This game's pretty badass.

167
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,751
You're up.

168
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,519
Tyler, I hear your sister's going out
with Squeak.

169
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:08,391
Another psych-out.
- I'm not going out with his sister.

170
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,191
That's the defense. - We gotta say
fucked-up shit to make 'em miss.

171
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,272
Oh, right.

172
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,478
Wait a minute! Why is me going out
with his sister fucked up?

173
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,314
Pierce, I hear
your mom's going out with Squeak.

174
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,795
Two outs!

175
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:28,037
You're gonna own 1/12 of the rent,
the water bill, the power bill,

176
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,034
the cable bill...
- Check it out! - What's that?

177
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,634
A baseketball!

178
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,270
You made a ball? Out of what?

179
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:44,274
I can't believe you were fired for
not shutting off our gas for 6 weeks!

180
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,875
Losing the truck pissed 'em off the most.

181
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:51,159
You can camp out here for a while.
- This is pretty sweet!

182
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:55,399
Does it fold out? - Yeah, a great bed!
But that's Jenkins' bed.

183
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,756
Your bed's over there.

184
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:03,075
Dude, that is so fucking weak. How am I
supposed to get a chick in that?

185
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:07,155
You couldn't get a chick if you had
$100 hanging outta your zipper.

186
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,835
Yeah, I could!
- No, you're a little bitch.

187
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,152
I am not!
Why am I hanging out with you guys?

188
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,438
'Cause you're a piece of shit.
- I am not.

189
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,398
But you're a little bitch.

190
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,794
Goddam it! You rip on me 13 or
14 more times and I'm outta here.

191
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,317
Whatever! I gotta show you
the scoreboard I made!

192
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,070
Your place is a shit-hole anyway.

193
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,757
At least I'm on the team.

194
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,596
Yeah, they want me...

195
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,912
Six months later

196
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:50,553
An new driveway game has captured
the imagination of a neighborhood.

197
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,916
...enjoying themselves
at the final game.

198
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:57,438
An entire league has sprung up.
- Starting with 12 teams in June.

199
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:02,630
Now down to just two,
including the inventors of the game.

200
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,919
It's off the rim.
Could be a double play, Maxwell tips...

201
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,748
Newman's try...

202
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,589
No!

203
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,240
Shirts have a shot at the conversion.

204
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,358
Remer...

205
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,033
Keeps it alive.
Last chance! Coop...

206
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,316
They make the conversion!
The home run counts!

207
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:44,714
What a game! The Shirts win
the World Championship

208
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,997
of Baseketball.

209
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,029
Gentlemen!

210
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,356
Gentlemen, I'm Ted Denslow.

211
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,756
The billionaire?
- Yes.

212
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,074
Anyway, I like your little game.
How'd you like to go pro?

213
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:06,511
Baseketball? - I got 3 words for you:
National Baseketball League.

214
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,028
We're not interested.
- Wait a minute! Hear me out.

215
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,273
You kids with your loud music
and your Dan Fogelberg,

216
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,717
your Zima, hula hoops
and Pac-Man video games.

217
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,439
Don't you see?

218
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:23,868
People's attention spans today can
only be measured in nanoseconds.

219
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,151
I hear you.
- Just look at these people!

220
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,156
They feel a certain connection with you
as players.

221
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,837
With baseketball
we can start fresh,

222
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,674
not allow teams
to change cities,

223
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:47,234
or players to be traded.
And everybody will get paid the same,

224
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,598
like when I was a kid
and players were treated like...

225
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,911
Indentured servants?
- Yes!

226
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:57,757
The real beauty of this game is
anyone can play.

227
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:03,154
Any normal Joe can be a sports hero.
Never wanted to be a sports hero?

228
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:08,030
Sure, once.
But that was long time ago.

229
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:12,479
If I know anything about this country,
it will go nuts for baseketball.

230
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,033
America will go crazy.

231
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:21,432
Listen to that crowd!

232
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:39,519
Five years later

233
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,470
9th inning. The Beers still behind by
3 runs and down to their last out.

234
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,713
The pressure on these players
has to be enormous.

235
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,315
Alright, guys, we've got one out left.

236
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:18,077
We can still win this thing.
Can we do it? - Yes!

237
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,352
What a game these fans are seeing!

238
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:27,436
That gentleman is Ted Denslow,
the father of professional baseketball,

239
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,514
along with his lovely new wife
Yvette.

240
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:37,592
Now shooting, number 44,
Coop "Airman" Cooper!

241
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,350
Coop is heading for the triple square.

242
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,514
Bob Costas, this has to be one
of the most exciting baseketball games.

243
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:51,515
Hard to believe that just 5 years ago
this game was played only on driveways.

244
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,070
Hard to believe that just 5 years ago

245
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,358
those girls were
only in grade school.

246
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:03,076
Coop at the triple line, and Jansen
sets up for the psych-out.

247
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,156
Be right with you!

248
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,356
It's good!
- Coop triples again.

249
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,228
He's hit for the cycle
already 7 times tonight.

250
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,635
Listen to those foam heads
doing the Beers' chug!

251
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:32,868
Coop's on third, with two down.
That brings up Squeak Scolari.

252
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:37,512
I knew it was gonna come down to me.
- It's not just you. We're a team.

253
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,911
It all comes down to just one man.

254
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,630
Oh, God! - If I could have
one guy out there, it'd be you.

255
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,474
Unfortunately,
that one man is Squeak Scolari.

256
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,235
Shit!
- Pretend this is just another game.

257
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,949
The Denslow Cup is
the biggest game of the season

258
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:56,751
Christ! - Will you turn that shit off?
- I'm scared! - Listen to me.

259
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:01,278
You make that shot, or I'm gonna shove
your head so far up your fucking ass...

260
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:06,037
Doug Remer giving his teammate
some last minute encouragement.

261
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,436
Go out there and make that shot!

262
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,073
The talented Felon girls
appearing in their 3rd Denslow Cup game.

263
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:29,189
Now shooting, number 23,
Squeak "Little Bitch" Scolari!

264
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,037
Squeak Scolari walks out
to take the last remaining single.

265
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,715
Come on, bitch!

266
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,677
Hey, Squeak! Miss it!

267
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,838
It's good!
The Beers stay alive in the 9th.

268
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,631
Dallas Felons' owner, Baxter Cain
hoping for another Denslow Cup victory.

269
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:59,272
Now shooting, number 17,
Doug "Sir Swish" Remer!

270
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,273
Remer heads for the double line.

271
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,435
Remer, you better make sure
your toe's not over the line.

272
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:12,072
Hey, Jansen, nice psych-out,
dingleberry. Yes!

273
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:16,197
It's now a 2-run game.
Dirk Jansen apparently missed

274
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,192
another psych-out.

275
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,353
Everyone at Beers Garden
is on their feet!

276
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,274
At a time like this

277
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,716
you can't help thinking about guys
like John Elway,

278
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,032
guys who kept coming close
and then finally got there.

279
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,551
If Coop can make this one,
the Beers' long wait will be over.

280
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,991
Hey, Coop, looks like
your boy Denslow's gonna buy the farm.

281
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,434
He missed.

282
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,959
The Felons win their
2nd consecutive Denslow Cup

283
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,510
on the strength
of a Dirk Jansen psych-out.

284
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,751
I got you, dude. I got you!

285
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,996
Relax. Do the Happy Dance!

286
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,233
We just lost the game!
- Do the Happy Dance!

287
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,437
Where's the singing?
- I don't wanna sing! - Come on, sing!

288
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,910
Shit, Denslow! - These Beers fans
have to be disappointed.

289
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:18,594
What an unfortunate thing
to happen on "Dozen Egg Night".

290
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,679
It's my husband!
Somebody help him! Oh, God!

291
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:30,153
If there's anything you need.
- Oh, Teddy! He just fell over!

292
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,557
I wish there was something I could do.

293
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:42,318
They stopped serving them after the 7th.
Get this man a hot dog!

294
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:50,388
You're absolutely right, Jim.
Ted Denslow was a hero,

295
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,997
because his vision brought baseketball
from local driveways into big arenas,

296
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,437
but more importantly,
into the hearts and TVs of America.

297
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,594
His untimely death casts a pall
over an otherwise sweet victory!

298
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,319
And all of our hearts...

299
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,518
Dirk Jansen, winner of

300
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,593
the "Winter's Warm Douche" M.V.P. Trophy.
What's your take?

301
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,357
The key to the game
was when I psyched out Coop.

302
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:21,558
He didn't psyche me out! If anyone got
the psych-out, it should be Denslow.

303
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,110
Dude, weak.

304
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:28,832
I know this is a dark time for you, but I'd like
your thoughts on what happened tonight.

305
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:33,392
I lost the big game
and a dear friend.

306
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:39,557
I'm feeling pretty vulnerable right now.
I don't think I should be alone...

307
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,509
It does seem to be raining shit
on Joe Cooper right now.

308
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,634
On paper,
the Beers had the far superior team.

309
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,838
But the outside shooting of Coop
and the deadly accuracy of Doug Remer.

310
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,800
What happened out there?
- Well, you know...

311
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,909
It was a team effort. It took every player
working together to lose this one.

312
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:00,995
Thanks, Doug. And so...
- You wanna do an interview with me?

313
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:05,029
No! So another baseketball championship
is in the books.

314
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,079
Yet another opportunity lost
for the Beers.

315
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,436
I gotta go.

316
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:18,192
What's going on? Coop?
- This was Tim McCarver

317
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:22,912
from Beers Garden, where the Felons
have defeated the Milwaukee Beers.

318
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,390
In Denslow Cup IV...

319
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:31,359
Everybody in.
One at a time.

320
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,909
There he is!

321
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:41,029
Coop! - Oh, man!
- Can we talk to him?

322
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,275
Excuse me.

323
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:50,069
Would you mind
signing autographs for the kids?

324
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,439
The Dallas locker room's over there.
- I know, but it was so crowded.

325
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,388
They'd really rather have
your autograph.

326
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:02,110
Really?
- Would you mind signing these?

327
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,069
Sure.

328
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,399
It's nice to meet you, Miss...?
- Reed. Jenna Reed.

329
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,598
Joe Cooper, Coop.
- I know.

330
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,753
Are all these kids with you?

331
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:20,630
I've been the director of the "Dream
Come True Foundation" since October.

332
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,235
The one that grants wishes
to sick and dying kids, right?

333
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,837
We prefer to think of them as
health- and survival-impaired.

334
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,475
You're a big fan of baseketball?
- No.

335
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:35,950
I mean, the kids are! I try to keep
them interested in permanent things.

336
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,032
Permanent?

337
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:43,070
Professional athletes come and go.
- Not in baseketball. There's rules against it.

338
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,674
Hello!

339
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,718
Miss Reed, this is Remer.
- Like a fresh pretzel?

340
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,674
I baked it myself.

341
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,396
Oh, thank you.
- Goes great with mustard.

342
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,953
Miss Reed?

343
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,351
You didn't make that, did you?
- No!

344
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:04,389
But chicks like guys who can cook.
- What?

345
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:09,157
See! She was checking out my ass.
- She wasn't!

346
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:12,199
I'd better get these kids back.
Little Travis is getting impatient.

347
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:16,718
I love kids. Which one is Travis?
Heads up, big guy.

348
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,435
Needs a little work on the hands.

349
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,914
He's blind, Doug.

350
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,234
Felons' fans

351
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:33,792
rejoiced in their Denslow Cup victory
in downtown Dallas.

352
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,351
Final tally: 14 injured, 3 dead.

353
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,870
The sports world was devastated
by the passing of Ted Denslow.

354
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:47,671
The late Beers owner seemed to be
the only one surprised by his death.

355
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:52,232
Time just finally ran out
for the old cocksucker.

356
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:58,112
Theodore Denslow dead at 85.
His hairpiece was 24.

357
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,508
These chaps

358
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:05,833
I wore in "Rootin' Tootin' Rhythm"
I bequeath to my nephew Herman.

359
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,073
Hope he looks
as snappy in them as I did.

360
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,597
And this poncho
that kept me dry...

361
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:17,109
Mrs. Denslow? Baxter Cain. May I?
- Of course.

362
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,354
My deepest sympathy!
- Thank you, Mr. Cain.

363
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,149
This hand-painted plate commemorating

364
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,118
the Pope's visit to Dodger Stadium

365
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:31,469
I leave to my niece Susan.
Limited edition, signed

366
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:36,112
with a photocopied certificate
of authenticity... - Jenna!

367
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:40,279
What are you doing here?
- I'm not sure.

368
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,989
I got this letter...
- Me, too.

369
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,871
And the toothbrush...

370
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,873
Where's the body?
- They buried him 2 days ago.

371
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:56,431
This is the will reading.
- Well, in that case...

372
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,196
These are for you, Jenna.

373
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,672
I bequeath these season tickets

374
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,835
to the "Dream Come True Foundation".

375
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:10,789
I had nothing but respect
for your late husband.

376
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:16,274
Unfortunately, he stood in the way
of making changes in baseketball

377
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:19,797
that might increase the owners' profits.

378
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,192
I can't imagine
what he had against making money?

379
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:28,432
I trust that quality
isn't sexually transmitted.

380
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,748
Pretty sweet, huh?

381
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:36,558
Yeah, the kids will be excited.
Especially little Joey.

382
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,157
Joey?
- He's such a big fan of yours.

383
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,075
He's going into the hospital next week,

384
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:46,677
and begged me to ask you to visit him,
but it's not a good idea.

385
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:50,470
I'd love to come by.
- I'll come by. I like hospitals.

386
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,359
You like Taco Bell.

387
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,149
I went to this hospital in France
and got together with this chick.

388
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,788
Dude, that was a hostel!

389
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,919
Finally, my beloved Beers,
I bequeath

390
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,753
controlling interest

391
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,150
to Joseph R. Cooper.

392
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,032
We own the team!

393
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:13,910
I gave him
the best 3 months of my life.

394
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,755
Way to go, dude!

395
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,036
And, Coop?

396
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,510
Yes, Mr. Denslow?

397
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:26,069
I know you have it in you to lead the Beers
to victory this season.

398
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,916
Because if you don't
the team reverts to Yvette.

399
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:36,754
Don't feel badly about losing the team.
I believe this is merely temporary.

400
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,232
Thank you, Mr. Cain.

401
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:44,475
It's nice to have a strong, handsome man
like you on my side.

402
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,316
Well, I'd love to discuss this
further with you.

403
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:53,271
Why don't you visit sometime?
Maybe we could

404
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:58,159
lay some carpet,
if you know what I mean.

405
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,393
At this time, I'd like to ask
everyone to leave the room,

406
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,792
so I can have
a private moment with Coop.

407
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,118
Now that we're alone, Coop,
there's something I wanna tell you.

408
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,273
Remember
when you had the crabs

409
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:18,719
and this lotion made you feel better?
I've found another use for it.

410
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:23,871
It's so good, it makes me wanna sing.
Just like the night

411
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,158
we spent in the tattoo parlor in Chicago.
Come on, baby!

412
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,032
You getting this?

413
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:59,595
That's two rooms done.
Those corners are tricky! - A fine job!

414
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:07,712
I've come up with a plan to make sure
Coop never wins the Denslow Cup.

415
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:13,638
So the team will be mine?
- Yes. - Wonderful, Baxter.

416
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,793
Do you want me to move on
to the conference room? - Not yet.

417
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:21,796
But I think my lobby
could use a good buffing.

418
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:27,194
If you know what I mean.
- I know exactly what you mean.

419
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,554
I can't do this shit!

420
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:38,912
The Beers coming up to bat
in this season opener against Miami,

421
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:42,312
a game
they have dedicated to Ted Denslow,

422
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:47,032
the team wearing black in memory
of the late Beers owner.

423
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,637
The Beers cheerleaders
also mourning the loss.

424
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:14,751
Dude, it's a whole different ball game
now that you own the team.

425
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:19,358
Denslow was right.
This season could be different.

426
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:23,309
We just gotta kick some ass
and play to keep this team. You ready?

427
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,756
I'm in, all or nothing.

428
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:36,711
Joining us this evening, big fan
of baseketball, Tony Nocciolino,

429
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:41,318
who plays Latino cutup Scooter
on the comedy series "What's the Difference?",

430
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,712
airing between "Recycled Junk",
starring Lisa Campbell,

431
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:48,032
and "Same Old Crap",
featuring teen heartthrob Mark Swenson.

432
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:52,229
All part of the great fall line-up
on "Who Gives a Rat's Ass" Thursdays.

433
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:56,269
Great to have you with us.
- So Miami takes the field.

434
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,318
We're underway.

435
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,236
Coop steps into
the single square.

436
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:10,278
It's good! - The Beers are off
to a promising start tonight!

437
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,911
This game is made all the more special

438
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,869
by the fact
it's "Free Range Chicken Night".

439
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,555
The Beers up by two,
but the Dealers are only one out.

440
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,554
That brings up Enrique Hernandez.

441
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,115
Hernandez, look!

442
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,394
Fat from Marlon Brando's ass.

443
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,829
Uh, no! What am I doing here?

444
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:43,910
It's all salty and warm.
Why would I do this?

445
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,912
This guy ate a lot of pork!

446
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,915
Damn it!

447
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:57,235
It was a killer psych-out. - Really?
- Shake it off. I got this guy.

448
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,272
Got milk?

449
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:11,110
Coop tips, and it's good!
Double play. Beers win.

450
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,235
Remer still nailing down that psych-out.

451
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:25,956
We totally kicked ass.
- And this is just the start.

452
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:30,069
Could you sign my chicken?
- Joe Cooper? Baxter Cain.

453
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:34,951
Denslow told me about you.
- Welcome to our community of owners.

454
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:38,909
If there's anything you need,
don't hesitate to ask. - Thanks, dude.

455
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:42,995
We're going to be voting next week
on some changes in baseketball's rules.

456
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:46,915
I want to tell everyone you're with us.
- Why it's fine the way it is.

457
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:51,791
Until we allow teams to move cities
and players to change teams

458
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,509
and take advantage
of lucrative corporate tie-ins,

459
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:58,913
you and your colleagues are going
to have to continue working for...

460
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,069
Chicken poo?

461
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:07,399
Feed. Chicken feed.

462
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,948
Coop, the ball is in your court.
For those rules to change,

463
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,955
every owner has to vote yes.
Denslow was already filthy rich.

464
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,800
He didn't need the changes.
But you do.

465
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:23,830
You're asking me to go against
every reason we created this game.

466
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,117
Before you make
any hasty decisions,

467
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:30,752
discuss it with your teammate.
- I don't have to. We think alike.

468
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:35,195
Sorry, but if you want unanimous consent,
get it from one of the other owners.

469
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,399
Are we gonna kick their ass?

470
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,674
We're gonna take these mooks out or what?
- Let me handle this one!

471
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:55,117
In the river, baby!
- Come on! - No doubt about it!

472
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,792
Your mother's
a terrible cook!

473
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,795
I'm gonna kick your ass.
- Easy.

474
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,030
Can't gross me out.
- Well, check out Coop!

475
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,959
I wanna feel you.

476
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,749
Deep inside me.

477
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,870
That's not fair!

478
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,311
Come on, Zane. That was...

479
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,192
That was fair. Let's play ball.

480
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,319
Hey, Watson,
have you seen those beer commercials?

481
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,509
How to speak San Franciscan.

482
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,709
"Vajoina"!

483
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:17,233
That wasn't a gay joke.
That was an Australian joke.

484
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:21,718
"Beers Still Winning
More and More Games"

485
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,788
Come on, let's do it!
- What do we always say?

486
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:37,078
One, two, three,
fuck the Mexicans!

487
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:46,074
I'll take my shot! Sure hope I make it,
so I can get home quick

488
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,392
and smack my wife in the eye.
- Shut up, Remer.

489
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,791
Shut your mouth!

490
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,550
Take that!

491
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,069
Aw shit!

492
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,676
My eye!

493
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,951
"If a woman wants a mate to respond,

494
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,840
she will reveal to him the secret
of a woman's duality.

495
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,993
She will tell him
about the interior woman,

496
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,073
that one who added to herself
makes two. "

497
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,994
I didn't expect you'd come.

498
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,595
I thought I'd say hi to little friend Joey.

499
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,798
He's sleeping, and
I really wanted to finish this book.

500
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,589
Well, maybe
it'll make him feel better. Joey!

501
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:02,198
Look who's here.
- My biological father?

502
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,713
No, Joe Cooper.

503
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,555
Is it really you?
- Yeah, it's me.

504
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,394
Your psych-outs
were the best.

505
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,199
Thanks, dude.

506
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,953
What's a "vajoina"?

507
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,595
What seems to be the problem, guy?

508
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,551
I'm going to die.

509
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:25,032
We're all gonna die.
- Yeah, but not this week.

510
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:31,314
What about staying positive?
Your donor liver's arriving today.

511
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,039
Look what I brought you.

512
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:37,437
Wow, A LA-Z-BOY!
- Yeah, I made it myself.

513
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:40,354
If I had a nickel for every time
this ball pulled me out,

514
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,352
I'd have a shitload of nickels.

515
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:46,434
I wanna be just like you
when I grow up.

516
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,751
Here's your decaf mocha, Jenna.

517
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:54,233
Just like you take it: Non-fat milk, low-whipped
cream and a sprinkle of cinnamon.

518
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,393
Thank you, Doug.
- I baked you fresh poppyseed muffins, too.

519
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:05,995
Poppyseed muffins! I thought you had
your electrolysis appointment today.

520
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,038
I did. Here.

521
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,999
Listen, partner.

522
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:19,000
I talked to the foundation.
They want to make your last wish...

523
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:23,116
They want to make your dream come true
as long as it doesn't

524
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,511
involve a miracle cure or something.

525
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,798
The guys on death row
only get a meal, right?

526
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,913
So, what's your dream?

527
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:35,198
I've always dreamed
of big-game hunting,

528
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,433
killing an endangered species,
like a bald eagle

529
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:42,799
or a giant panda. - That's not
in the spirit of the foundation.

530
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,997
How about poisoning the reservoir?

531
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:49,234
Or throwing flesh-eating fish
into a public swimming pool?

532
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,710
I don't think you're getting the point.

533
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,439
Come on, Joey.

534
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:58,550
Search your heart. What's the one thing
you want more than anything else?

535
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,479
Chelsea Clinton?

536
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,512
That's a pretty tall order.
- You'd have a better shot at Bill.

537
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,956
Any backup dreams?

538
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,634
There is one other thing.

539
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:15,035
Could I just once
hang out with the team?

540
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,318
Just spend a day with the Beers?
Could I, Coop?

541
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:22,592
I don't know...
- And Miss Reed, too.

542
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:42,758
This has been so fun. I feel like
I'm gonna puke all over the bar.

543
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:45,949
Look, Jerry Springer!

544
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:51,438
Here is your daughter-in-law...
- She's my son's wife.

545
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,749
Nicole! Let's say hi to Nicole.

546
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,516
We'll drink every time
a fight breaks out.

547
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,188
Fight!

548
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,718
Fight!

549
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:24,795
You see, Joey,
dreams really do come true.

550
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:41,470
You're the best, Coop!

551
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:46,878
Man, it's late. We've got a game tonight
and you've got that big liver operation.

552
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:48,909
Yeah, but...

553
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:51,515
What, dude?
You're gonna be fine.

554
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,275
I know I could pull through, if...

555
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:57,388
If what, dude?
- Just say it and Coop will do it.

556
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:02,912
Do you think you could hit
a home run for me tonight? - Well...

557
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:06,118
It's not like he's asking you
to hit 2 home runs!

558
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:09,876
Can you hit 2 homeruns?
- Of course.

559
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:14,876
This is Coop Cooper. He could hit
3 home runs if you wanted. Huh, Coop?

560
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:20,634
3? Alright. - Remer, can I talk to you
over there real quick?

561
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:25,830
You know, Joey, I've hit my fair share
of homeruns, too.

562
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:30,950
Nice, but Coop's gonna hit 3 home runs
for me. - Great, Joey.

563
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:34,318
Coop's the greatest guy
in the whole world!

564
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,039
Yeah, he's a major dude.

565
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,112
I feel much better now.

566
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:42,756
Mr. Squeak? - What?
- What grade are you in?

567
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,119
Anybody call a taxi?

568
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:49,990
I called a taxi! - We gotta get going
if I'm gonna hit those 3 home runs.

569
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,834
Don't worry.
From now, everything's gonna be A-OK.

570
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:56,471
This is the best day
of my entire life.

571
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:00,399
What a story this is!

572
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:05,351
Little Joey Thomas undergoing
a lifesaving operation tonight.

573
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:11,918
The fans here all wearing yellow ribbons
in support of this brave little boy.

574
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:16,756
And his hero, Joe Cooper,
promising to hit 3 home runs,

575
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:22,871
a promise that could decide between
life and death for this brave boy.

576
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,477
Hey, Pete!
What's the matter with Coop tonight?

577
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,553
I don't know,
but he smells like Christian Slater.

578
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:32,315
Coop getting ready
to take his shot.

579
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:37,278
It's good! Coop sinks his 2nd home run.

580
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:49,394
His blood sugar's way up since yesterday.
Has his fluid intake been changed?

581
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:51,711
His sodium level's through the roof!

582
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:56,750
It's strange. He's 8 years old
and smells like Robert Downey, Jr.

583
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:58,388
9th inning.

584
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:03,032
Everyone's stomach in knots here,
as Coop steps up. One more chance

585
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:04,668
for that 3rd home run.

586
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,470
She's here, that girl from the bar.
- That's a guy.

587
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:16,155
A guy?
- A dude.

588
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:19,154
You're just saying that,
'cause you want her yourself.

589
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:24,236
I'm saying that, because she's a guy.
- It's impossible! Just look at her!

590
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,631
The cutest little upturned nose,

591
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:31,238
the softest lips,
the sweetest Adam's apple...

592
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:37,794
I can smell her perfume from here.

593
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:57,472
Coop calls for quiet.

594
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:00,348
One more chance for that 3rd home run.

595
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:05,594
He's in deep focus.
This obviously means a lot to him.

596
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:11,710
He shoots! It's going, going...

597
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:16,309
Coop has made a dream
come true for that brave little...

598
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:26,237
Wow! The Lord must really have it in
for that little boy.

599
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,594
Why?

600
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:35,232
Come on, Coop. It's over.

601
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:36,675
Poor Joey!

602
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:40,197
Why? - Sorry, dude.
- If you're looking for Joey Thomas,

603
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,989
he's been moved next door.

604
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,831
Oh, my God!

605
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:53,358
Why? Why?
- Gentlemen,

606
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:54,715
in this room!

607
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:01,111
Joey! I'm here for you, dude!

608
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:06,071
The operation went fine. Just after
the game, he seemed to be suffocating.

609
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:11,235
He kept screaming, "Choke!" and lost
consciousness. He'll be fine tomorrow.

610
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:13,517
Don't stay too long.

611
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:17,997
Sorry
I missed that 3rd homerun.

612
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:22,592
Remember I said dreams come true.
Well, they don't.

613
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:26,550
He's trying to tell you something!

614
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:28,951
What is it, Joey?

615
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:32,552
He's turning blue!
- He's freezing. He needs a blanket.

616
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,957
Sir, can I borrow your blanket?
- I'm here for you, Joey.

617
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:42,318
This should keep you warm.

618
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:45,914
He's flatlining!
You killed him!

619
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:50,359
I didn't kill him! - You missed
the 3rd home run, and you killed him.

620
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:54,196
No! I'm not gonna give up on this kid!
- Calm down, man!

621
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:55,715
Come on!

622
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:57,873
Get a hold of yourself!
- Leave me alone!

623
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:00,511
Live, damn it!

624
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:05,277
What are you doing? - Where are those
paddle things George Clooney uses?

625
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,233
Give me those things!
- You're gonna kill him! - Clear!

626
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,435
No pulse!
- More power! - 10,000 volts!

627
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,598
15,000!

628
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:32,753
You know what you're doing?
- What's it look like? - An execution?

629
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:35,789
I'm trying to save a life.

630
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:38,192
I'm giving it all I've got, Captain!

631
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:41,029
I love ya, always have.

632
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:44,589
Clear!

633
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:49,150
We gotta try
open heart massage.

634
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:52,757
Scalpel! Where do I cut?

635
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:57,916
Code blue, nurse! 70 cc's
of sodium pentothal, stat!

636
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,997
I didn't kill him.
- Get outta here!

637
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:03,556
Cardiac syringe coming through!

638
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:22,394
Jackson having an incredible night.

639
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:26,998
And he's already hit
2 home runs tonight.

640
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:32,634
You have to wonder what
Charlie Hough is thinking, as Reggie...

641
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,949
...when man and beast
collide.

642
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:41,476
Death on the back roads
and byways of America!

643
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:58,269
I can't believe those assholes
taped over the game.

644
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:11,274
Hi, I hope I'm not interrupting anything.

645
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:14,752
I was just
fixing clam chowder.

646
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:20,030
Come in. - When you weren't
at the hospital, I came right over.

647
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:25,195
There was some terrorist attack
on the post-op ward. - Terrorists?

648
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:31,311
Yeah, they were disguised as baseketball
players. I was so worried...

649
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:34,871
about Joey.
- Was he...? Is he...?

650
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:38,511
Oh, he's fine. He came through
the operation with flying colors.

651
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:42,549
With that new liver he should be peeing
like a champ in no time.

652
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,359
That's kidneys, Coop.

653
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:48,109
Have a seat.

654
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:53,875
Thank you for all you've done for Joey.
- Oh, it's nothing.

655
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:57,955
He's going to remember this day
for the rest of his life.

656
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,153
I don't doubt that.

657
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:04,590
What a great picture!

658
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:09,357
Look at you guys. You seem so happy.
- I guess we were.

659
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,591
Best friends playing ball on the driveway.

660
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:15,913
Next thing I know,
I'm on ESPN and Wheaties boxes.

661
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:20,996
It's all pretty sweet,
but since Denslow's been gone,

662
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:24,756
I'm in charge of the team,
and the whole league now.

663
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:26,991
Sometimes I forget
why I play the game.

664
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:31,035
Why do you play it, Coop?
- Mr. October.

665
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:35,154
The guy in the Chippendales calendar?
- No, that was Dwayne Zackemore.

666
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:38,920
I mean,
whoever it was that month.

667
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:45,874
I'm talking about Reggie Jackson.
He hit 3 home runs in one game.

668
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:48,510
I caught the 3rd one
in the stands.

669
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:52,117
It meant so much to me.
All I ever dreamed of was

670
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:55,432
to be that guy,
have that one shining moment.

671
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:59,558
Be a hero.
- You already are a hero, Coop.

672
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:04,357
You've won
these kids' hearts, but...

673
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:05,909
What?

674
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:10,438
I'm just worried about getting attached.
I mean, the kids getting attached.

675
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:14,389
I don't want them to be hurt.
- Jenna,

676
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,595
I would never do anything to hurt...
these kids.

677
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:24,828
What Joey really needs to know is:
Where will you be next year?

678
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:27,239
Right here.

679
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:30,359
And the next year,
and the year after that.

680
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:34,638
Until Joey grows up,

681
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:40,796
and gets his driver's license
and starts going out with girls

682
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,357
and meets the right one and
forgets about baseketball altogether...

683
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,795
...goes home,
does some push-ups,

684
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:56,795
fucks the sleeve
of his favorite jacket. - What?

685
00:53:57,320 --> 00:54:00,710
I'm just saying, we'll be here
for Joey. I promise.

686
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:04,112
Oh, Coop,
I want to believe you...

687
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:08,393
Coop, check out
this cool shit we got at the hospital...

688
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:10,597
Hey, Jenna.
- Hey, Doug.

689
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,833
You're a little flushed. You have a temperature?
- No, I'm fine.

690
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:16,674
Open your blouse
and say "Ahh".

691
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:20,356
I gotta go. - No...
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

692
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:28,075
Thanks a lot, Dr. Dickhead. You totally
fucked me there. - It was a joke.

693
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:31,358
Give it up! She doesn't like you.
- She has the hots for you?

694
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,398
Squeak has a better chance.

695
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:36,792
You think?
- That's low. - Why is that low?

696
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:41,671
Right now you're jealous, but don't
blame me for my sweet ass.

697
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:47,557
I'm doing the Happy Dance...

698
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:50,189
Does this thing work?

699
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:53,391
Can you hear me on this?
- Yeah, check it out.

700
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:55,199
Asshole!

701
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:59,797
Wanna get a sandwich?
- Yeah, let's get a sandwich.

702
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:01,679
Goddam!

703
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:07,358
Mr. Cain, Doug Remer is here to see you.
- Remer? I asked him to come tomorrow.

704
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:11,912
Yes, sir, but he's here now
in the trophy room. - The trophy room?

705
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:17,552
Sweet.

706
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,436
I see you've been admiring
my museum. - Is that really...?

707
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:45,149
Yes. When I see something I want,
I get it.

708
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:48,677
Remind me to show you
the prize in the collection:

709
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:51,719
My autographed Ty Cobb bat.

710
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:55,151
I'm planning to expand the museum.

711
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:59,515
Killer set-up, Mr. Cain. What do you pay
in rent? - Nothing. I own it.

712
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:04,357
Can you break a 20?
- What? Dollars? - I didn't think so!

713
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:08,435
Let me get straight to the point, Don.
May I call you Don? - Yeah.

714
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:12,230
When I see one of baseketball's stars
with less than $20 in his pocket,

715
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:16,155
driving an American car,
sharing a house with 2 other guys,

716
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:19,711
you know what that says to me?
- Homos?

717
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:24,113
No! It says you're underappreciated
and underpaid!

718
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:28,874
Yeah, I guess we are underpaid.
- I want to change all that.

719
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:33,068
Players of your caliber should be making
the big bucks. Don't you agree?

720
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:40,075
Try to stay with me, alright?

721
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:44,951
I tried to get Coop to agree to changes
that would make you millions.

722
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,078
Me? Millions?
- Now listen carefully.

723
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:50,597
Do you think Shaq got rich
playing in Orlando?

724
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,959
Hardly. He did it by moving to L.A.
Know how much he makes now?

725
00:56:55,680 --> 00:57:00,595
As much as at college?
- What? A lot more! Big money.

726
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,434
And you can, too.
- Would I have quit baseketball?

727
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:06,673
What? No! I need you
to get Coop to go along.

728
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:08,752
He'd have to quit baseketball, too?

729
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:14,758
Did I just fart?

730
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:27,033
Top of the 7th.
Those cheers you're hearing

731
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:32,434
are from the nearly 15,000 on hand
for "Anal Probe Night".

732
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:37,671
2 outs. Remer heading for the
triple square. He's 0 for 12 tonight.

733
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:42,790
With the exception of Coop,
the Beers are ice-cold.

734
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:46,476
Oh, man! That doesn't even
qualify as an air ball!

735
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,440
The Beers are gone
in the 7th.

736
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:54,277
The Aliens coming up with the top
of their order, the same 3 guys

737
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:56,477
who came up last inning.

738
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:00,156
What the hell's going on?
You guys are lying down out there!

739
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:02,915
I get it. You guys are pissed off.

740
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:04,839
Why?

741
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,879
You turned down Cain's offer
without talking to us.

742
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:16,796
What do you want, dude?
- What do you think?

743
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:20,317
We invented this game together,
but you get to control everything.

744
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:23,359
Denslow gave me the team.
I already told Cain no.

745
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:27,309
Denslow's happy in his worm farm...
- Dude, I'm not gonna do it.

746
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:30,678
Do you think Shaq got rich
playing in Orlando?

747
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:34,629
No, in college. Everybody knows that.
It's not about the money.

748
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:36,708
It's about tradition.

749
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:39,953
Think about the greats
who have played this game.

750
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:45,389
It's because of them and us that I can't
bow down to a guy like Cain.

751
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:50,157
It's easy for you. You got the team.
We got jack shit! Even Squeak's pissed!

752
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:51,959
I never really minded...
- Shut up, bitch!

753
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:56,194
Dude, quit thinking about yourself!
- Dude, I'm not gonna cave in!

754
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:57,794
Dude?

755
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:09,199
I guess you've got a point there.
Alright, maybe I was wrong.

756
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:12,637
From now on, we're full partners.
- Really?

757
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:17,997
You all own part of the team, too.
- Really? You do that for us?

758
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,914
And that's not all:
Prime equity stock options,

759
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:23,709
comprehensive health care,
full dental, traveling H.M.O.

760
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:28,193
And 20 weeks of psychiatric care
free of charge. Like it should be.

761
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:56,114
Hey, Smits!
Wanna see a scary face?

762
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:02,912
What?
- Dude...

763
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:11,959
"There were four of them in the corral:
The once-proud beast, the broken girl,

764
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:16,194
her mother, and, finally, the man
they called The Whisperer.

765
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:18,871
The woman stared hopefully

766
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:23,910
into the ancient cowboy's weathered face.
'Can you help her? '

767
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:27,118
'I repair cows, not people. '

768
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:30,318
His disjointed voice seemed... "

769
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,829
The Beers win
their 10th consecutive game...

770
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:38,071
Who's this bimbo
Coop's got the hots for?

771
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:41,916
Jenna Reed, the director
of some kids' charity,

772
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:44,470
"Dream Come True Foundation. "

773
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:47,789
I know 6 men on their board.

774
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:52,113
Baxter Cain is not going quietly
into the good night. - Baxter?

775
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:53,839
Who is Ty Cobb?

776
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:56,993
Oh, my God!
- Did I just fart?

777
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:20,912
9th inning, the Beers are just one out away
from making the play-offs.

778
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:25,552
They'll have to get by Big Ed Tuttle
and the L.A. Riots.

779
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:30,433
That's him, Squeak. That's Tuttle.
- He's been talking shit about you.

780
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:34,310
He told everyone he caught you
jacking off before the game.

781
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:36,790
He saw that?

782
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:39,152
You oughta get this guy.

783
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:43,633
Look at him, man... he's huge!
You want me to psych him out?

784
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:47,749
He'll never expect it.
- Here, say this...

785
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:53,994
I'm not gonna remember all that!
- This is for the play-offs.

786
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:55,992
If you get this guy, we're in.

787
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:58,197
We've got your back.

788
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:21,988
You mother's deaf. - My mother
is dead, you little twerp!

789
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:27,280
So that's why
she didn't move around a lot.

790
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:32,278
Unbelievable! The Beers win!

791
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:35,629
The Beers have done it.

792
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:50,672
The Beers win a spot in the play-offs
on a psych-out by Squeak Scolari.

793
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:55,994
He is pissed.

794
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:01,719
I didn't go over the line, did I?
- Not at all. - Don't worry!

795
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:11,671
Hey, you missed it! We won!
- We kicked ass! We're in the play-offs!

796
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:14,514
Yeah, let the tears come.
You're gonna make me start crying.

797
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:18,359
This is really emotional.
- Should we just cry?

798
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:22,548
We should. We won the game,
got friends, we've got everything!

799
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:26,748
Stop that! I'm not crying,
because I'm happy.

800
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:31,756
Our funding's been cut.
They're gonna close the foundation.

801
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:34,750
Can they do that?

802
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:40,076
Poor kids! We can't let this happen.
- We gotta do something.

803
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:45,235
Sorry. I didn't mean to come here
and ruin your big night...

804
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:46,629
Sorry.

805
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:48,473
Jenna, wait!

806
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:54,597
I couldn't help but overhear
your conversation with Miss Reed.

807
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,753
What are you doing here?
- I jet here, I jet there.

808
01:04:58,160 --> 01:04:59,957
There's no reason

809
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:04,239
for your girlfriend's foundation
to go into Chapter 11...

810
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:07,996
I think I may have a solution
to her problem. There!

811
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:11,749
A time-tested moneymaker.
Every athlete does it.

812
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:14,355
You want me to have bigger titties?
- What?

813
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:15,988
No!

814
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:18,753
It's a clothing line.

815
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:20,513
A Beers clothing line.

816
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:23,514
That's against the baseketball bylaws.

817
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:27,151
Not if the proceeds go to charity.
Think about it.

818
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:30,120
Miss Reed's foundation
will never worry about funding again.

819
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:33,318
Awesome! We should do it!

820
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:35,199
Excuse us.

821
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:39,354
Let me do the talking. No way I'm doing
a deal with this piece of shit.

822
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:42,433
I thought it was "we".
It's not just up to you anymore.

823
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:46,799
Alright, we can come up
with a better way. - Like how?

824
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:50,793
Thought so.

825
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:54,715
Mr. Cain? As part owner of the Beers,
I'd like to say: Where do I sign?

826
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:57,634
Congratulations, Don,
this is gonna change your life.

827
01:05:58,040 --> 01:06:01,555
I look out for my "wimmins".
- Before we discuss fabric or color,

828
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:04,030
we decide where to make this stuff cheap.

829
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:07,512
We'll do a big media blitz.
Don't worry. Coop will come around.

830
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:37,836
Hi there. I'm Dan Patrick.
- And I'm Kenny Mayne.

831
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:43,519
With the first 7 months out of the way,
the play-off picture is now emerging:

832
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:45,990
With last night's victory over Boston

833
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:51,394
the Beers must beat Indianapolis
to advance to Charlotte,

834
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:55,713
then to the National Eastern
Division North to play Tampa.

835
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:58,031
If the Beers beat Detroit
and Denver beats Atlanta

836
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:02,831
in the S.W. Division East Northern,
then Milwaukee goes to the Denslow Cup,

837
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:06,471
unless Baltimore upsets Buffalo
and Charlotte ties Toronto.

838
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:09,030
Then Oakland would play L.A.
And Pittsburgh.

839
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:13,592
If no clear winner emerges,
a two-man sack race will be held

840
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,752
till a champion is crowned.

841
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:31,438
After the gruelling
regular BASEketball season,

842
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:35,719
we're now in month 9
of the play-offs.

843
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:38,755
No, Daddy, don't touch me there!

844
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:45,593
The Beers, vying for a slot
in the Denslow Cup. 9th inning.

845
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,831
Ferries up by one, Coop steps in.

846
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:52,754
Home run!
Coop ties it up.

847
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:55,720
That could mean extra innings.

848
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:22,837
Who's he? - My entertainment lawyer
for my movie contract.

849
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:26,710
Now you're a big shot you're gonna
act in a Hollywood movie?

850
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:32,752
Now shooting, number 17,
Doug "Sir Swish" Remer!

851
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:56,036
Beers win!

852
01:08:57,120 --> 01:09:02,114
The Beers have done it.
They're on their way to the Denslow Cup.

853
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,878
Who is that?
- Who's it look like?

854
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:20,191
Victoria Silvstedt,
Playmate of the Year.

855
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:23,797
Hello! Victoria Silvstedt,
Playmate of the Year.

856
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:31,954
What's that?
- It's a commitment ring.

857
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:33,475
For Jenna?

858
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:37,668
Yeah, I'm ready to consider
thinking about dating her exclusively.

859
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:41,314
I'm giving Jenna
a pre-commitment ring,

860
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:44,678
to promise to pledge we'll get engaged
as soon as we make a commitment.

861
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:46,957
You don't care about Jenna!

862
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:51,114
You were in a hot tub with a Playmate.
- You know what?

863
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:56,032
That hurts, man. My clothing line
is saving Jenna's foundation.

864
01:09:56,440 --> 01:10:00,911
Sorry, I forgot how much Doug Remer
cares about kids. - Gentlemen!

865
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:07,439
Hate to interrupt your celebration,
but this might interest you.

866
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:14,598
Go ahead, don't be shy. Open it.
I think you'll find it interesting.

867
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:19,152
What's that old saying? - "A penny saved
is a penny earned"? "Don't eat cheese... "

868
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:20,754
Shut up!

869
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:25,995
How about "One picture is worth
1,000 words"? - That's a good one!

870
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:29,039
What low life scum
would use children this way?

871
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:30,509
You would!

872
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:32,834
Me? Never!

873
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:37,950
Gentlemen, those are pictures
of the Beers clothing line

874
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:41,033
in Calcutta.
- Oh, just great.

875
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:46,992
If they ever get out, the Beers and
the foundation will be ruined.

876
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:50,794
But rest assured. No reason to panic.

877
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:55,796
Those pictures never have to see
the light of day, if...

878
01:10:56,360 --> 01:10:57,952
If what?

879
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:05,591
If you two
miss the next Beers game.

880
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:09,117
The next game is the Denslow Cup.
- You've been reading the papers.

881
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:11,875
Do as I say. Play ball,

882
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:15,477
and you'll be just fine. - You said
you didn't want us to play ball.

883
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:18,920
I want you to play ball with me.

884
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:20,958
You want us to play for Dallas?

885
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:30,440
You don't want us to show up at all!
- Of course. It's called blackmail!

886
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:32,195
Good evening!

887
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:40,390
I told you
this was going to happen!

888
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:43,758
If you'd have agreed to Cain's changes
it never would have.

889
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:49,314
Because of you the foundation's screwed.
- Me? - Oh, there you are!

890
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:52,037
I saw the pictures.

891
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:57,192
This is awful! It means the end
of the foundation. It's not endowed

892
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:01,309
like...
- Jenna, I can explain.

893
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:04,029
Yes, it was his fault.

894
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:08,797
It's your mess, Remer. I should've kept
the team. - Dude... - Enough!

895
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:13,879
Look at yourselves! You're just typical
men with humongous egos!

896
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:15,793
The kids' lives

897
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:19,795
are ruined, and all you can do is argue
about who has the bigger penis.

898
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:21,758
I mean, child.

899
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:24,029
Long wanger...

900
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:25,595
Throbbing cock...

901
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:29,788
I don't know anymore. - Jenna, wait!
- You've gotta believe us!

902
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:32,270
It was all Coop's fault!

903
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:36,875
Can we talk over there?
Pig fucker? Can I call you that?

904
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:39,430
No, only my friends call me pig fucker.

905
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:49,439
Know what? You're not my best friend
anymore. How do you like that?

906
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:52,957
I love it.
- Good. I'm glad.

907
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:56,598
I'm sick of playing
second fiddle to you.

908
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,389
I'm getting myself
a new best friend.

909
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:04,389
Wake up, bitch. You're my best friend.
- Really? What?

910
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:06,119
Are we going to the zoo?

911
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:10,997
Fine! I don't need you. I'll get myself
a new best friend, too.

912
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:15,473
Go ahead. Go back to your fancy cars,
big bank accounts

913
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:19,077
your celebrity friends,
and your beautiful women

914
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:22,517
and Victoria Silvstedt,
Playmate of the Year.

915
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:25,069
Fuck!

916
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:28,312
Your life
is spinning out of control.

917
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:33,316
Seems the whole world
is out to get you.

918
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:35,836
Everything is wrong.

919
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:38,913
Nothing seems right.

920
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:43,317
There's a sinking feeling inside.

921
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:47,679
Even your best friend
has turned his back.

922
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:50,913
But you can't let it
bring you down.

923
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:53,550
You gotta fight.

924
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:59,192
'Cause you try,
but you can't let go.

925
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:02,953
It's when you're down
that you gotta get up.

926
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:05,920
Don't let 'em walk all over your face!

927
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:07,912
Stand up for yourself

928
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:11,471
and make everything right again!

929
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:14,509
Even if some guy's trying
to blackmail you.

930
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:17,514
And your girlfriend thinks
you suck.

931
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:22,869
It's up to you to let them know
it was some rich guy's evil plan.

932
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:25,916
Look out ahead,
there's a truck changing lanes.

933
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:29,118
You've got crumbs on your upper lip.

934
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:34,355
Warts on your dick aren't going away,
less you start using cream every day.

935
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:38,712
Ladies and gentlemen,

936
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:43,318
welcome to Calcutta. It is currently
95 degrees with a light drizzle.

937
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:46,280
We hope you enjoy your stay
in lovely Calcutta.

938
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:55,919
I'm in a hurry!

939
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:59,596
Just take me to 7-1-1...

940
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:06,953
Beerswear Factory.

941
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:09,157
Hey, you!
- No entrance.

942
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:11,630
Who the hell are you?
- I factory manager. Who you?

943
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:16,670
I Joe Cooper. I mean, I'm Joe Cooper.
- Wait, put on a hard hat!

944
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:22,713
This isn't good.
Do the authorities know?

945
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:33,396
A young man. His whole life
in front of him disappears.

946
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:37,429
A familiar story,
but this is no ordinary Joe.

947
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:41,271
Joseph R. Cooper, the most loved
sports figure in the country...

948
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:42,669
vanished.

949
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:47,359
Elsie Melcher, a neighbor
who asked not to be identified, says

950
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:50,115
Joe Cooper left his house
2 weeks ago.

951
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:53,592
According to Angelique Bones,
a nosy bitch who lives up the street,

952
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,673
he took only a toothbrush,
a wallet, a steamer trunk

953
01:15:57,080 --> 01:15:59,036
and a plane ticket
to Calcutta.

954
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:02,353
Police have several possible scenarios
of what happened

955
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:05,752
to the man affectionately known
to the world as "Coop".

956
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:11,072
I don't know where he is. He could be
hanging in his closet. - Scenario 1:

957
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:13,550
He's hanging in his closet.

958
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:21,995
The night before his disappearance,
Coop's girlfriend paid him a visit.

959
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:23,674
They quarreled.

960
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:27,834
You'll find Joe Cooper, wherever
you'll find the most heinous

961
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:31,437
and vile exploitation of children.

962
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:35,594
Scenario 2:
Coop went to Disney World.

963
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:42,479
Here's a photograph taken just days
before his disappearance.

964
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:47,635
Here's a computer-enhanced simulation
of what he might look like today.

965
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:53,793
From Milwaukee, Wisconsin,
it's the Denslow Cup,

966
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:56,475
where the defending champion,
the Dallas Felons,

967
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:59,758
meet their perennial challengers,
the Milwaukee Beers.

968
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:02,993
Hello, I'm Al Michaels
along with Bob Costas inviting you

969
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:06,073
to join us here at Beers Garden
for Denslow Cup V.

970
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:08,630
We're in for a classic battle tonight.

971
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:14,273
You're right. We have over 100 million
people tuned in to see this game.

972
01:17:14,680 --> 01:17:17,148
Many of them, of course,
with no understanding of the sport,

973
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:21,314
but fascinated by the flickering images
and the pretty colors.

974
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:26,714
High up in the stands,
pyrotechnic expert Sergio "Lucky" Ferouch

975
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:30,510
is readying another spectacular
halftime fireworks display.

976
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:33,195
Alright, guys.
You ready to kick some ass?

977
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:40,717
What's wrong? Why the long faces?
- Can't win without Coop.

978
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:43,839
We don't need Coop.
I'll lead you to victory.

979
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:46,913
We're supposed to be a team.
Without Coop it's not the same.

980
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:51,199
Even if Coop was to walk in here now,
it wouldn't change things one iota.

981
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:54,398
We can win this thing!
Are you with me?

982
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:56,995
That's the spirit! Are you with me?

983
01:17:57,400 --> 01:17:59,675
Coop's here!

984
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:07,874
We're underway here
for the Denslow Cup V.

985
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:37,358
A stunned crowd of over 18,000
witnessing the Beers...

986
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:39,478
Come on, Beers! Go, Coop!

987
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:42,792
Hey, guys. Thought I told you
we weren't going to watch this game.

988
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:45,156
Miss Reed, it's the Denslow Cup!

989
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:48,870
These aren't the kind of people
to be emulated.

990
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:52,113
The severed head
was postmarked Denver.

991
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:54,476
The owner still
has not stepped forward.

992
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:58,190
Update: The disappearance of
the Milwaukee Beers baseketball star.

993
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:02,229
When Joe Cooper discovered that
Beerswear Factory workers were kids,

994
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:05,837
not old enough for prostitution,
he personally flew there.

995
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:09,120
His new, all-adult workforce
now makes a decent wage,

996
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:13,911
enjoys full medical benefits
and in-house child care. We are glad

997
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:16,356
that such a terrific human being
like Joe Cooper has returned.

998
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:19,069
If I were a woman,
I'd like to be his girlfriend,

999
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:22,870
walking in the park,
hand in hand,

1000
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:25,874
wrapping my legs around him,
cuddling in the spoon position

1001
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:30,193
and staring into his eyes
over our morning coffee.

1002
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:31,919
Yes, thank you.

1003
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:36,791
In a minute, another unsolved mystery.
- Come on, kids!

1004
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:39,270
We're going to the game!

1005
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:43,076
Ladies and gentlemen!
For the 7th-inning entertainment,

1006
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:46,790
the National Baseketball League
is proud to present

1007
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:49,589
a salute to our South Sea neighbors:
Viva Calypso!

1008
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:57,270
We're up 16 to nothing. Have the trucks
pull up to the locker room.

1009
01:19:57,680 --> 01:20:00,638
We'll sort out the stuff
when we get to Jacksonville.

1010
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:05,033
Hey, Baxter?
I finally got all the chrome off this for you.

1011
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:08,352
Nice.
- You want me to start on this one?

1012
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:10,838
Ladies and gentlemen,

1013
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:14,118
please direct your attention to the
Malaka-Laka Balance Board of Trust,

1014
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:18,957
symbol of brotherhood in many
Polynesian countries. In the role

1015
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:24,593
of the downtrodden but happy natives:
Your Milwaukee Beers!

1016
01:20:26,240 --> 01:20:28,959
Thanks for flying back, Coop.
You really made a difference!

1017
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:31,590
If not for your mess,
I wouldn't be jetlagged

1018
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,991
and shitting curry.
- Guys, knock it off!

1019
01:20:34,600 --> 01:20:37,433
Representing their white
colonial oppressors:

1020
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:40,991
The Dallas Felons.
Now let's all join

1021
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:44,756
our Caribbean brothers
in the ceremonial handshake

1022
01:20:45,160 --> 01:20:47,549
above the Lagoon of Peace.
- Let go!

1023
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:50,115
Stop it!

1024
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:51,509
Guys!

1025
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:54,388
Stop it!
- Money-grubber! - Powermonger!

1026
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:12,268
Die!
- Asshole!

1027
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:14,557
Would you just stop it?

1028
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:19,316
Look at you guys, fighting
on the Malaka-Laka board!

1029
01:21:20,160 --> 01:21:22,116
You should be ashamed!

1030
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:25,392
Back in the driveway
we were nothing.

1031
01:21:25,960 --> 01:21:27,552
Now we've risen to the highest level,

1032
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:31,349
but you're throwing it all away.

1033
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:34,320
If you've forgotten
what baseketball means to America,

1034
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:37,109
you have only to look at this board,

1035
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:39,954
the Malaka-Laka Balance Board of Trust.

1036
01:21:40,360 --> 01:21:41,998
Don't you see
what we have here?

1037
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:44,356
A game
where guys with bad backs

1038
01:21:44,720 --> 01:21:47,632
and bad knees
can get together and compete

1039
01:21:48,040 --> 01:21:50,270
as guys who are goosed up on steroids.

1040
01:21:51,720 --> 01:21:53,358
But more than anything,

1041
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:57,230
isn't this game about being with
your friends and having a good time?

1042
01:21:59,160 --> 01:22:00,513
I remember...

1043
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:05,390
A long time ago,
I didn't have anybody.

1044
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:08,470
You guys took me in.

1045
01:22:09,240 --> 01:22:11,151
That's why it kills me
to see you like this.

1046
01:22:13,960 --> 01:22:18,192
If we can't be friends, then the heart
and soul are out of this game.

1047
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:21,350
Certainly out of me.

1048
01:22:22,120 --> 01:22:24,270
I know I'll never get that back again.

1049
01:22:26,240 --> 01:22:29,835
We have sullied the waters
of the Lagoon of Peace.

1050
01:22:30,240 --> 01:22:31,468
I'm begging you,

1051
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:37,191
for the love of our Caribbean brothers,
stop this madness!

1052
01:22:46,240 --> 01:22:51,268
Hang on! - Oh, my God! - Remember
to hold your breath just before we hit.

1053
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:59,239
It is the most spectacular extravaganza
I have ever seen.

1054
01:22:59,640 --> 01:23:02,598
You can cram 3 seats into the space
it takes for one wheelchair.

1055
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,434
Not to mention the wasted space
for the oxygen bottle!

1056
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:08,593
Those little shits never pay
full price anyway.

1057
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,355
I just realized
I can't stand you!

1058
01:23:12,680 --> 01:23:14,477
You can kiss these puppies goodbye.

1059
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:24,354
Shit, Coop. I'm sorry. I guess
the money did go to my head.

1060
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:27,035
No, I'm sorry, Remer.

1061
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:30,273
I've got a lot to learn
about sharing.

1062
01:23:30,680 --> 01:23:33,114
Look at me!
I've become everything I used to hate.

1063
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:36,273
Maybe we
just grew up too fast.

1064
01:23:36,680 --> 01:23:39,433
My worst enemy turned out to be me.

1065
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:42,153
Dude!

1066
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:50,789
I've got two over.

1067
01:23:57,400 --> 01:24:00,551
Alright!
Let's go win the championship!

1068
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:43,232
Hey, that's my wife.
- And this is me!

1069
01:25:08,760 --> 01:25:12,992
What is it? - I hear
your sister's going out with Squeak.

1070
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,514
Squeak Scolari
crosses the plate again

1071
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:24,309
as the Beers have come
roaring back since the break.

1072
01:25:24,720 --> 01:25:27,188
This is more like the Beers team
we've seen all season.

1073
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:30,797
9th inning.
Beers still down by 2 runs.

1074
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:33,077
Felons on 1st and 3rd.

1075
01:25:33,480 --> 01:25:36,552
The Beers have to stop Dallas
if they want to stay in this game.

1076
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:39,030
The always dangerous Grumsky coming up.

1077
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:44,036
Get this guy. - I don't know what to do.
Nothing works on him.

1078
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:49,190
Tell him he's fat.
- That's not cool.

1079
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:52,160
No, just do it really subtle.

1080
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:53,675
Subtle...

1081
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:56,718
You losing weight?

1082
01:25:57,640 --> 01:26:00,359
You're goddam fucking fat...

1083
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,639
The Beers hold them on the 9th
on a clutch psych-out

1084
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:10,871
by Coop Cooper.

1085
01:26:16,240 --> 01:26:20,358
Bottom of the 9th.
Dallas 16, Milwaukee 14.

1086
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:22,955
Remer on 2nd,
Scolari on 3rd.

1087
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:25,510
Coop's coming up.

1088
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:31,192
It all comes down to this. One shot.
If Coop makes it,

1089
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:34,751
the Beers win the Cup
and get to keep the team.

1090
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:38,028
Or he misses.

1091
01:26:56,720 --> 01:27:00,269
Oh, my God!
LA-Z-BOY has popped!

1092
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:10,951
The ball Coop has used every day.
A time-out has been called,

1093
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:15,399
as the Beers star
tries to regroup. - Excuse me,

1094
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:19,395
think you could go any faster?
- Can I go any faster?

1095
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:22,399
Hang on!

1096
01:27:29,560 --> 01:27:34,634
The loss of this ball is going to affect
the outcome of this game.

1097
01:27:42,240 --> 01:27:44,595
Come on, kids!

1098
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:48,629
Just one shot! You can do it!
We can win this thing.

1099
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:53,677
Stop! Don't shoot!

1100
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:58,355
Here. I brought this for you.

1101
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:03,551
I made it myself. Just like you.
- You made this?

1102
01:28:03,960 --> 01:28:06,076
Miss Reed helped me for most of it.

1103
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:08,038
But I finished it myself.

1104
01:28:08,440 --> 01:28:10,829
Joey, this is great.

1105
01:28:11,720 --> 01:28:15,190
Coop, you know what
Miss Reed told me tonight?

1106
01:28:16,720 --> 01:28:19,837
She said she wants me
to be a big sports star.

1107
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:22,996
Just like Joe Cooper.

1108
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:39,356
Thanks, dude!
- Go get 'em, Coop!

1109
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:48,873
When's the last time you made a
homerun without LA-Z-BOY?

1110
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:03,398
Al, we've seen some classic
Denslow Cup battles in the past,

1111
01:29:03,800 --> 01:29:08,635
but I can't remember one that rivalled
the drama and excitement of this one.

1112
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:19,593
It's off the rim...

1113
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,753
Could be a double play.
Darcy tips.

1114
01:29:25,040 --> 01:29:26,553
Jansen's try...

1115
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:27,949
No!

1116
01:29:29,560 --> 01:29:32,677
Beers have a shot at the conversion!
Remer keeps it alive!

1117
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:36,030
Last chance...

1118
01:29:42,920 --> 01:29:45,275
Coop up!

1119
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:55,319
It's...

1120
01:29:56,040 --> 01:29:57,553
...good!

1121
01:30:34,040 --> 01:30:37,237
In all my years of calling games
I've never been this excited.

1122
01:30:37,640 --> 01:30:40,313
You're excited?
Feel these nipples!

1123
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:49,910
Update: We still have no fucking clue
where this guy is.

1124
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:46,677
Alright.

1125
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:48,634
What is it?

1126
01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:51,838
What is it?
- It's Reggie.

1127
01:31:55,240 --> 01:31:56,719
Reggie Jackson.

1128
01:32:00,720 --> 01:32:03,154
Well, go! Go ahead!

1129
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:16,072
Nice going out there.

1130
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:19,870
Thanks. You know I gotta tell you,
it's 'cause of you that I'm here.

1131
01:32:20,280 --> 01:32:21,474
That's nice to know.

1132
01:32:22,440 --> 01:32:23,839
I brought this for you!

1133
01:32:24,240 --> 01:32:27,437
I saw some kid in the ballpark with it.
You gotta hang on to that.

1134
01:32:28,680 --> 01:32:30,398
I got the two home run balls I hit
in the World Series.

1135
01:32:31,640 --> 01:32:33,551
Some little shit got the 3rd one.

1136
01:32:35,360 --> 01:32:39,990
That sucks. I gotta get my trophy.
Let's have a hot dog sometime.

1137
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:42,470
Alright, sounds good.

1138
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:44,552
I don't have your fucking ball.

1139
01:32:47,480 --> 01:32:51,439
Good luck next year.
- Oh, thanks!

1140
01:32:55,560 --> 01:32:56,595
Got milk?

1141
01:32:57,760 --> 01:32:58,829
I'm sorry.

1142
01:33:01,960 --> 01:33:06,158
The National Baseketball League
would like to present to the Beers

1143
01:33:06,560 --> 01:33:10,314
With this year's Denslow Cup.
Congratulations!

1144
01:33:10,760 --> 01:33:13,957
Take your victory lap.
As they skate off,

1145
01:33:14,360 --> 01:33:18,069
one thinks about a team that conquered
adversity, overcame the odds,

1146
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:23,396
a team that defied the critics,
a team that...

1147
01:33:23,720 --> 01:33:26,871
And so, the ideal of sports
once again blossomed

1148
01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:30,477
from a tiny seed,
nurtured, as always,

1149
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:33,075
by the dreams of the young.

1150
01:33:33,480 --> 01:33:35,755
I'm the King of the World!

1151
