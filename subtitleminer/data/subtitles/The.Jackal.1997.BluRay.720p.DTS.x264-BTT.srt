Mr. Gorbatschow,

2
00:02:01,098 --> 00:02:31,086
tear down this war!

3
00:02:31,086 --> 00:02:32,087
Bring to an end the Soviet empire...

4
00:02:32,087 --> 00:02:35,090
and its 70 year experiment of comunism...

5
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:39,094
continuing stife in... regions, along with widespread corruption

6
00:02:39,094 --> 00:02:41,096
and economic misery

7
00:02:41,096 --> 00:02:43,098
resulting in a virtual tidal wave of crime....

8
00:02:43,098 --> 00:02:45,100
the Russian maffia has involved into a world class

9
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,103
organized crime network,

10
00:02:48,103 --> 00:03:01,116
with profits in billions including substantial US operations.

11
00:03:01,116 --> 00:03:03,118
announcingthe unprecedented opening

12
00:03:03,118 --> 00:03:06,080
of the FBI legal attache office in Moscow

13
00:03:06,080 --> 00:05:23,092
along with the first ever joint US
and Russian cooperation. They insist....

14
00:05:23,092 --> 00:05:27,096
Ghazzi is in the Club. He is in position.

15
00:05:27,096 --> 00:06:31,118
O.k. Up to go. MVD only!

16
00:06:31,118 --> 00:06:32,119
What is this?

17
00:06:32,119 --> 00:06:34,079
An Amerikan.

18
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:36,081
Who the fuck are you?

19
00:06:36,081 --> 00:06:38,083
Deputy Director Carter Preston,

20
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:40,085
FBl.

21
00:06:40,085 --> 00:06:44,089
You fuck Americans now?

22
00:06:44,089 --> 00:06:47,092
You ugly milicia whore.

23
00:06:47,092 --> 00:06:48,093
And you,

24
00:06:48,093 --> 00:06:49,094
go fuck yourself!

25
00:06:49,094 --> 00:06:51,096
This is not Chicago.
This is Russia.

26
00:06:51,096 --> 00:06:55,100
So take your bitch and get the fuck out of here!

27
00:06:55,100 --> 00:07:01,106
Do you think I am afraid of the MVD?

28
00:07:01,106 --> 00:07:04,109
I swear I will kill you...

29
00:07:04,109 --> 00:07:06,111
and your fucking whore mothers, if you don't get...

30
00:07:06,111 --> 00:07:08,113
I repeat...
Fuck you, fuck you!

31
00:07:08,113 --> 00:07:10,115
You scumface cunt! Fuck you!

32
00:07:10,115 --> 00:07:51,115
All right, that's enough!

33
00:07:51,115 --> 00:07:53,117
It's never easy taking a life...

34
00:07:53,117 --> 00:07:55,119
but you saved one, too.

35
00:07:55,119 --> 00:08:11,093
Mine. Thank you.

36
00:08:11,093 --> 00:08:12,094
If you had my warning...

37
00:08:12,094 --> 00:08:15,097
they must have ambushed our men outside...

38
00:08:15,097 --> 00:08:19,101
before we knew it, there were militia with their gunns

39
00:08:19,101 --> 00:08:19,101
out in every corner of the room.

40
00:08:19,101 --> 00:08:23,105
They just opened fire and killed him.

41
00:08:23,105 --> 00:08:26,108
It happened so fast...

42
00:08:26,108 --> 00:08:30,112
it was over before it started.

43
00:08:30,112 --> 00:08:34,116
Good. My poor brother...

44
00:08:34,116 --> 00:08:39,079
How many militia did you kill?

45
00:08:39,079 --> 00:08:42,082
Terek please,we didn't have a chance.

46
00:08:42,082 --> 00:08:43,083
There were 30 of them.

47
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:52,092
Plus the American.
Yes, yes. But how many did you kill?

48
00:08:52,092 --> 00:08:54,094
None.

49
00:08:54,094 --> 00:09:00,100
None? Not even one?

50
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:04,104
Terek please. I did what I could...

51
00:09:04,104 --> 00:09:08,108
You did what you could!

52
00:09:08,108 --> 00:09:12,112
You let those militia pigs and that American scum kill my brother.

53
00:09:12,112 --> 00:09:16,116
Without killing one in return?

54
00:09:16,116 --> 00:09:19,119
O.k. That's what you could do.

55
00:09:19,119 --> 00:09:31,090
Here is what I can do!

56
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:34,093
I loved this man like a brother.

57
00:09:34,093 --> 00:09:37,096
He was a dear friend and partner to me.

58
00:09:37,096 --> 00:09:41,100
So I took no joy in that.

59
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,102
But just think...

60
00:09:43,102 --> 00:09:46,105
if I could do this to one I love...

61
00:09:46,105 --> 00:09:53,112
what could I do to someone I hate?

62
00:09:53,112 --> 00:09:56,115
So... the american FBI...

63
00:09:56,115 --> 00:10:01,120
declare war with us.

64
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,081
And war it is.

65
00:10:04,081 --> 00:10:08,085
Unlike other...

66
00:10:08,085 --> 00:10:11,088
The hiena takes no chances.

67
00:10:11,088 --> 00:10:13,090
Never atacking under sure of a kill.

68
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:16,093
Though a consument killer,

69
00:10:16,093 --> 00:10:22,099
he is clearly no gentelman.

70
00:10:22,099 --> 00:10:24,101
I apologise for keeping you waiting.

71
00:10:24,101 --> 00:10:27,104
I had some other buisiness to dispose off.

72
00:10:27,104 --> 00:10:30,107
So much wasted time,

73
00:10:30,107 --> 00:10:31,108
confusing motion with acomplishment.

74
00:10:31,108 --> 00:10:49,084
Another drink ?

75
00:10:49,084 --> 00:10:52,087
The MVD killed my brother.

76
00:10:52,087 --> 00:10:54,089
For that, I will see them drown in blood.

77
00:10:54,089 --> 00:10:57,092
But their allies in America...

78
00:10:57,092 --> 00:11:00,095
I wish to send them a message,

79
00:11:00,095 --> 00:11:01,096
and very bad public (bad).

80
00:11:01,096 --> 00:11:08,103
I want to strike fear into the marrow of their bones.

81
00:11:08,103 --> 00:11:22,117
Can you kill this person?
Yes.

82
00:11:22,117 --> 00:11:24,119
If I take this job I have to dissapear.

83
00:11:24,119 --> 00:11:27,081
Forever.

84
00:11:27,081 --> 00:11:30,084
So if you want me to do this, you're going to have to pay me.

85
00:11:30,084 --> 00:11:33,087
How much?

86
00:11:33,087 --> 00:11:34,088
American dollars.

87
00:11:34,088 --> 00:11:37,091
All cash, of course.

88
00:11:37,091 --> 00:11:45,099
A half now, a half on completion.

89
00:11:45,099 --> 00:11:50,104
70 million.

90
00:11:50,104 --> 00:11:53,107
Why not?

91
00:11:53,107 --> 00:11:54,108
Done.

92
00:11:54,108 --> 00:11:57,111
How many people know about this?

93
00:11:57,111 --> 00:12:01,115
You and I.
Keep it that way.

94
00:12:01,115 --> 00:12:04,118
Don't refere to our arrangement by telephone or fax, ever.

95
00:12:04,118 --> 00:12:08,080
You should find a place outside Russia to hide,
untill the mission is completed.

96
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:12,084
If are leaks it will be my choice weather to continue the mission or not.

97
00:12:12,084 --> 00:12:16,088
I've had a way I keep the initial payment.

98
00:12:16,088 --> 00:12:20,092
Agreed?
O.k.

99
00:12:20,092 --> 00:12:26,098
Informants tell us Terek has put bounties on all MVD and FBI personel.

100
00:12:26,098 --> 00:12:30,102
Deputy Director Preston and Ihave special bounties on our lives.

101
00:12:30,102 --> 00:12:33,105
In two weeks seven MVD operatives have been killed.

102
00:12:33,105 --> 00:12:34,106
At least we know we are getting into.

103
00:12:34,106 --> 00:12:37,109
Informants say it is just a start.

104
00:12:37,109 --> 00:12:41,113
Terek has planned something more dramatic.

105
00:12:41,113 --> 00:12:42,114
8 days ago...

106
00:12:42,114 --> 00:12:46,118
Terek and his two top lieutenats were spotted in the town of Porvoo,

107
00:12:46,118 --> 00:12:48,120
60 kilometres West of Helsinki.

108
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,079
They have been there ever since...

109
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:52,082
taking the entire thoughtful of for themselves and their bodyguards.

110
00:12:52,082 --> 00:12:54,084
All for Specnaz, nine in all

111
00:12:54,084 --> 00:12:57,087
but one has left the building in five days.

112
00:12:57,087 --> 00:13:01,091
Their only contact with the outside is this man,

113
00:13:01,091 --> 00:13:03,093
Victor Politovsky.

114
00:13:03,093 --> 00:13:07,097
Goes to the Porvoo post office twice a day for Terek's mail which arrives general delivery.

115
00:13:07,097 --> 00:13:12,102
Contact Interpol and get everything you can on Politovsky.
Yes sir.

116
00:13:12,102 --> 00:13:13,103
Terek's men are notoriously hard to turn out.

117
00:13:13,103 --> 00:13:18,108
Should we get the opportunity, we must be prepared to conduct the interrogation

118
00:13:18,108 --> 00:13:19,109
with the at most efficiency.

119
00:13:19,109 --> 00:13:27,117
Good day to you, Mr Preston.
Sir.

120
00:13:27,117 --> 00:15:22,107
I don't think I wanna know what that means.

121
00:15:22,107 --> 00:15:26,111
The new contamination is a tricky part.

122
00:15:26,111 --> 00:15:27,112
They got to use ethyl acetylene.

123
00:15:27,112 --> 00:15:28,113
Nasty stuff.

124
00:15:28,113 --> 00:15:31,116
Gives you a liver cancer.

125
00:15:31,116 --> 00:15:37,081
And I used a disk drive to erease the magnetic strip.

126
00:15:37,081 --> 00:15:38,082
It's perfect.
Thank you.

127
00:15:38,082 --> 00:15:45,089
You really did a beautiful work.

128
00:15:45,089 --> 00:15:49,093
What do I owe you?

129
00:15:49,093 --> 00:15:50,094
I think your ballance is about...

130
00:15:50,094 --> 00:15:53,097
375 pounds.

131
00:15:53,097 --> 00:15:57,101
This is 500 pounds.
Ooo...thank you!

132
00:15:57,101 --> 00:16:00,104
Luck with it baby.

133
00:16:00,104 --> 00:16:26,088
See you next time.

134
00:16:26,088 --> 00:16:29,091
How do you want the accounts handled?

135
00:16:29,091 --> 00:16:31,093
Split the deposit equally between

136
00:16:31,093 --> 00:16:31,093
the Macao and the Panama accounts.

137
00:16:31,093 --> 00:16:35,097
And the balance?
Live it here in dollars.

138
00:16:35,097 --> 00:16:37,099
I need you to open me a Luxemburg account.

139
00:16:37,099 --> 00:16:39,101
And get me some credit cards
use an American bank.

140
00:16:39,101 --> 00:16:41,103
I'll sign you the names this week.

141
00:16:41,103 --> 00:16:46,108
I'll live the creditcards in your box in Montreal.

142
00:16:46,108 --> 00:16:48,110
Oh..this also came in the draught.

143
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:51,113
I need to use your computer, Clive.

144
00:16:51,113 --> 00:16:56,118
Of course, everything is ready for you.

145
00:16:56,118 --> 00:16:59,079
Good afternoon.

146
00:16:59,079 --> 00:17:01,081

Cost will be $200.000 US.

168
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:05,104
Transfer funds in a usual manner,
half now, half on delivery.

169
00:18:05,104 --> 00:18:07,106
To the following address:

170
00:18:07,106 --> 00:18:10,109
"Letterham Shipping",
Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

171
00:18:10,109 --> 00:18:14,113
GIH 876.

172
00:18:14,113 --> 00:18:25,082
Client name: Murdock, Charles C.

173
00:18:25,082 --> 00:18:28,085
What are they planning?

174
00:18:28,085 --> 00:18:31,088
Why is Terek in Finnland?

175
00:18:31,088 --> 00:18:33,090
The Americans... Killed. Example.

176
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:36,093
Jackal? What Jackal ?

177
00:18:36,093 --> 00:18:38,095
It doesn't make sense.

178
00:18:38,095 --> 00:18:41,098
What are they planning for?

179
00:18:41,098 --> 00:18:47,104
Who are you?

180
00:18:47,104 --> 00:18:53,110
You fucken Jackal!

181
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:55,112
Why are you hanging around?

182
00:18:55,112 --> 00:19:02,119
Revive him.
Jesus...

183
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:05,080
Drug assistance interrogation is perfectly legal,

184
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,082
when the matter is a state security.

185
00:19:07,082 --> 00:19:13,088
Unfortunately Mr Politovsky had an undiagnozed heart condition.

186
00:19:13,088 --> 00:19:15,090
He said...

187
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:16,091
Jackal?

188
00:19:16,091 --> 00:19:20,095
Does this mean something to you, Mr Preston?

189
00:19:20,095 --> 00:19:23,098
He is supposedly a killer for hire, who uses that name.

190
00:19:23,098 --> 00:19:24,099
Several assasinations was acredited to him,

191
00:19:24,099 --> 00:19:41,116
but we have never been able to prove if he even exists.

192
00:19:41,116 --> 00:19:45,120
From time to time he was KGB assert.

193
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,081
Do you have a name?
No name.

194
00:19:47,081 --> 00:19:51,085
Payments were made to the contracting organizations

195
00:19:51,085 --> 00:19:53,087
or a Hong-Kong bank account.

196
00:19:53,087 --> 00:19:55,089
no KGB member has ever seen him.

197
00:19:55,089 --> 00:19:59,093
Do we know, if he ever operated in the US?

198
00:19:59,093 --> 00:20:00,094
No.

199
00:20:00,094 --> 00:20:02,096
But...

200
00:20:02,096 --> 00:20:07,101
Politovsky's briefcase contained bigraphical material...

201
00:20:07,101 --> 00:20:11,105
on your Donald Brown,
Director of the FBl.

202
00:20:11,105 --> 00:20:44,096
Jesus Christ. These guys are going for the gold.
Get her on the phone for me.

203
00:20:44,096 --> 00:20:48,100
Good morning. Purpose of your visit to Canada?
Steel...

204
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:53,105
Fishing.

205
00:20:53,105 --> 00:20:59,111
Enjoy your stay Mr...Hayslip.
Thank you. I will.

206
00:20:59,111 --> 00:21:02,114
Man, I give you a really good deal on this minivan, you know...

207
00:21:02,114 --> 00:21:05,117
It's brand new, it's fully loaded.

208
00:21:05,117 --> 00:21:07,119
We have got 60 CD changer for you.

209
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:08,120
Now, the only thing I need right now is your driving licence,

210
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:11,081
your credit card and I'll check this with the credit manager.

211
00:21:11,081 --> 00:21:16,086
I think everything should be okay Mr Murdock.
Oh. Make it Charlie, allright?

212
00:21:16,086 --> 00:22:26,115
Allright Charlie, see you in a second.
Take your time.

213
00:22:26,115 --> 00:22:29,118
I want this...close hold.

214
00:22:29,118 --> 00:22:31,120
No publicity.

215
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:35,082
For the working group together,
Staat, CIA, Secret Service,

216
00:22:35,082 --> 00:22:37,084
Russian Emabassy.

217
00:22:37,084 --> 00:22:41,088
I'll have daily progress reports 9 p.m. at this office.

218
00:22:41,088 --> 00:22:44,091
Major Koslova, anything else?

219
00:22:44,091 --> 00:22:46,093
Since 1983...

220
00:22:46,093 --> 00:22:50,097
KGB provided founding for fight direct action missions.

221
00:22:50,097 --> 00:22:52,099
One bombing and 4 assasinations...

222
00:22:52,099 --> 00:22:54,101
The Jackal was the operative used.

223
00:22:54,101 --> 00:22:58,105
Not giving me much to work with, Preston.

224
00:22:58,105 --> 00:23:00,107
We don't have much, Sir.

225
00:23:00,107 --> 00:23:02,109
Major Koslova's informers can't finger.

226
00:23:02,109 --> 00:23:05,112
They don't know who he is.
The CIA can't track him.

227
00:23:05,112 --> 00:23:07,114
Then what?

228
00:23:07,114 --> 00:23:09,116
Using KGB files I've identified 6 operatives we belive,

229
00:23:09,116 --> 00:23:11,118
they have actually seen him.

230
00:23:11,118 --> 00:23:14,079
4 are dead, one is in Lybia,

231
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:16,081
but the last one is belived to be here in the United States.

232
00:23:16,081 --> 00:23:20,085
A bask Separatist named lsabella Celia Zancona.

233
00:23:20,085 --> 00:23:22,087
She maight at least know how he looks like.

234
00:23:22,087 --> 00:23:24,089
But we have no idea about where she is.

235
00:23:24,089 --> 00:23:26,091
Now, someone must tell...

236
00:23:26,091 --> 00:23:28,093
Interpol says...

237
00:23:28,093 --> 00:23:31,096
in the 80's she was involved with one...Declan Joseph Mulqueen,

238
00:23:31,096 --> 00:23:31,096
IRA sharpshooter.

239
00:23:31,096 --> 00:23:33,098
so they decided to get him out of Irland

240
00:23:33,098 --> 00:23:37,102
and shipped him over here.

241
00:23:37,102 --> 00:23:39,104
In 1989 he picked up twice 25 years

242
00:23:39,104 --> 00:23:41,106
for weapon...

243
00:23:41,106 --> 00:23:46,111
He is curently serving time in
a maximum security state camp in Massachusetts.

244
00:23:46,111 --> 00:23:47,112
I say he does know where she is.

245
00:23:47,112 --> 00:23:50,115
What makes you think he'll talk to you?

246
00:23:50,115 --> 00:23:53,118
I'm hoping he will cooperate for a reduced sentence.

247
00:23:53,118 --> 00:23:54,119
But don't promise too much.

248
00:23:54,119 --> 00:24:14,098
After all...he's a terrorist.

249
00:24:14,098 --> 00:24:23,107
You have got some visitors, Mulqueen.

250
00:24:23,107 --> 00:24:24,108
What do you want from lsabella ?

251
00:24:24,108 --> 00:24:26,110
She has done nothing here.

252
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:31,115
She entered the country illegaly.

253
00:24:31,115 --> 00:24:31,115
What?

254
00:24:31,115 --> 00:24:35,119
The FBI sent Deputy Directors

255
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:38,080
out after illegal aliens?

256
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,083
Give over, Preston,
What you're really looking for?

257
00:24:41,083 --> 00:24:43,085
A pro.

258
00:24:43,085 --> 00:24:50,092
Calls himself "The Jackal".

259
00:24:50,092 --> 00:24:53,095
The "Mystery-Man".

260
00:24:53,095 --> 00:24:55,097
We think she maight have seen him,
and may be able to help us find him.

261
00:24:55,097 --> 00:24:58,100
If so, we will arrange a pardon for her

262
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:01,103
signed by the President of the United States.

263
00:25:01,103 --> 00:25:02,104
And garantee - no extradition,

264
00:25:02,104 --> 00:25:07,109
and also garantee, the Spanish government will never know about her.

265
00:25:07,109 --> 00:25:09,111
They don't know now, do they?
Neither do you.

266
00:25:09,111 --> 00:25:21,081
Let's keep it that way.

267
00:25:21,081 --> 00:25:23,083
Would it matter that you maight be saving a human life?

268
00:25:23,083 --> 00:25:28,088
Human life, whatever, say again
...would it be important enough for all of this?

269
00:25:28,088 --> 00:25:32,092
Mr Donald Brown, Director of the FBI.

270
00:25:32,092 --> 00:25:37,097
It can not be truth.

271
00:25:37,097 --> 00:25:40,100
Look, we know that certain elements in this prison want you dead.

272
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:43,103
The entire government wants me dead, Mister.

273
00:25:43,103 --> 00:25:45,105
Yet, here I am.

274
00:25:45,105 --> 00:25:46,106
Oh you smart ass, let's cut the bullshit.

275
00:25:46,106 --> 00:25:51,111
You cooperate, and you'll be to transfer to a minimum security facility.

276
00:25:51,111 --> 00:25:53,113
That's our deal.

277
00:25:53,113 --> 00:25:55,115
And that's your chance
to walk out this god damn place in one piece.

278
00:25:55,115 --> 00:26:00,120
That's a one-time offer.
Take it or leave it.

279
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:03,082
Stuff a time, waste of fucken time...

280
00:26:03,082 --> 00:26:20,099
Pardon my language, I've been in prison...

281
00:26:20,099 --> 00:26:23,102
Alright, what would it take for you to help us?

282
00:26:23,102 --> 00:26:26,105
First I'd have to be convinced that Isabella would be kept safe.

283
00:26:26,105 --> 00:26:29,108
Done.

284
00:26:29,108 --> 00:26:31,110
Then you would have to let me go,

285
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:35,114
back to Ireland. Free man.

286
00:26:35,114 --> 00:26:38,117
Out of the question.

287
00:26:38,117 --> 00:26:41,120
Besides gunnery, you are a known killer by the British government...

288
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:45,082
Not to mention all the women and children you've probably blew out.

289
00:26:45,082 --> 00:26:46,083
It's not my war!.

290
00:26:46,083 --> 00:26:48,085
I was never a bomber.
I don't see the distinction!

291
00:26:48,085 --> 00:26:51,088
You steal human lives.

292
00:26:51,088 --> 00:26:54,091
A distinction is a killer at war.
I wanna go home. As simple as that.

293
00:26:54,091 --> 00:26:56,093
Simple for you, perhaps.

294
00:26:56,093 --> 00:27:00,097
Same as in Russia, soldiers go home when the truce is signed yet?

295
00:27:00,097 --> 00:27:05,102
Well, that's not gonna happen. Sorry

296
00:27:05,102 --> 00:27:08,105
Alright, just the chance.

297
00:27:08,105 --> 00:27:11,108
Your best effort is to give me freedom.

298
00:27:11,108 --> 00:27:16,113
I'll sell her for your word on it.

299
00:27:16,113 --> 00:27:21,118
I'm sorry.

300
00:27:21,118 --> 00:27:23,120
So the Jackal is after your Director, is he?

301
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,081
Just tell him to get his affairs in order,

302
00:27:26,081 --> 00:27:29,084
Nobody can save him now.

303
00:27:29,084 --> 00:27:31,086
Nobody, except me!

304
00:27:31,086 --> 00:27:37,092
Because I've met him!

305
00:27:37,092 --> 00:27:50,105
Oh yeah, didn't I mentioned that?

306
00:27:50,105 --> 00:27:53,108
I can identify him, by his face. Give me the opportunity.

307
00:27:53,108 --> 00:27:59,114
But more importantly..by his methods.

308
00:27:59,114 --> 00:28:01,116
So you can leave Isabella out of this.

309
00:28:01,116 --> 00:28:03,118
Did you work with him?

310
00:28:03,118 --> 00:28:08,082
With him? No. No way.

311
00:28:08,082 --> 00:28:14,088
Did you have a problem with this man?

312
00:28:14,088 --> 00:28:22,096
That's between him and me.

313
00:28:22,096 --> 00:28:25,099
Isabella Zancona is the only confirmed contact we have.

314
00:28:25,099 --> 00:28:28,102
And we will find her.

315
00:28:28,102 --> 00:28:35,109
With or without your help.
O.k., o.k.

316
00:28:35,109 --> 00:28:36,110
I want 3 things.

317
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:38,112
One: get me out of here.

318
00:28:38,112 --> 00:28:39,113
No use to here

319
00:28:39,113 --> 00:28:45,119
What will keep you from trying to escape?

320
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:47,121
Nothing. Simply, I give you my word.

321
00:28:47,121 --> 00:28:48,080
Two:

322
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:52,084
I go with you to meet lsabella.

323
00:28:52,084 --> 00:28:53,085
Why?

324
00:28:53,085 --> 00:29:00,092
To see her. That's all.

325
00:29:00,092 --> 00:29:02,094
And the third thing?

326
00:29:02,094 --> 00:29:09,101
Decent razor.

327
00:29:09,101 --> 00:29:11,103
Here is how it's gonna go:

328
00:29:11,103 --> 00:29:13,105
You will be searched...

329
00:29:13,105 --> 00:29:16,108
and if we find as much as a paperclip, that hasn't been authorized

330
00:29:16,108 --> 00:29:17,109
I send you right back to prison.

331
00:29:17,109 --> 00:29:20,112
The same goes for using the telephone.

332
00:29:20,112 --> 00:29:23,115
you don't trust me? As far as I can throw you...

333
00:29:23,115 --> 00:29:24,116
But I have a little choice.

334
00:29:24,116 --> 00:29:28,120
And if you have got any thoughts about the IRA snatch

335
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,080
we will shoot to kill...them and you.

336
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,082
And not necesserily on their arm

337
00:29:32,082 --> 00:29:35,085
Understand ?
I heard you.

338
00:29:35,085 --> 00:29:47,097
Go along and we will get along.

339
00:29:47,097 --> 00:29:54,104
I will keep a real good eye on you.

340
00:29:54,104 --> 00:30:03,113
Miss Koslova, is it?

341
00:30:03,113 --> 00:30:07,117
And what your first name be, then?

342
00:30:07,117 --> 00:30:18,087
Major. Major Koslova.

343
00:30:18,087 --> 00:30:36,105
We're a bit rusty, that's all.

344
00:30:36,105 --> 00:30:40,109
Sub assembly of titanium, so light as stresses will allow.

345
00:30:40,109 --> 00:30:43,112
The arms are gonna traverse 270 degrees.

346
00:30:43,112 --> 00:30:46,115
...drive mechanism with two time servos.

347
00:30:46,115 --> 00:30:50,119
All things are gonna run at 12 Volt DC.

348
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:52,121
Okay. Well, it's car batteries, that's cool.

349
00:30:52,121 --> 00:30:56,083
How much weight is the arm gonna support?
55 kilograms.

350
00:30:56,083 --> 00:31:00,087
Hehe...bigfucker, yea?

351
00:31:00,087 --> 00:31:03,090
Hey, you want one?
No.

352
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:07,261
You know, I want this in 8 days.

353
00:31:07,303 --> 00:31:09,596
I can do that.

354
00:31:09,596 --> 00:31:14,602
O.k. How much?

355
00:31:14,602 --> 00:31:16,604
Well, titanium is gonna be a problem.

356
00:31:16,604 --> 00:31:21,609
It's a listed material, so it's gonna take time
and a little more money.

357
00:31:21,609 --> 00:31:28,616
50 grand?

358
00:31:28,616 --> 00:31:30,618
I mean... well... 40...

359
00:31:30,618 --> 00:31:32,620
40 grand.

360
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:33,621
Alright.

361
00:31:33,621 --> 00:31:37,583
Half now, half on delivery.

362
00:31:37,583 --> 00:31:43,589
This suckers definietly are gonna kick some ass, yea?.

363
00:31:43,589 --> 00:31:45,591
It is straight:

364
00:31:45,591 --> 00:31:48,594
When you finish this unit, your gonna turn over the plans
and all the scrap material

365
00:31:48,594 --> 00:31:53,599
You're gonna forget about Charlie Murdock and his plans

366
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:55,601
Yea, sure man, I'm cool.

367
00:31:55,601 --> 00:32:01,273
Relax.
Alright.

368
00:32:31,595 --> 00:32:35,599
Are you nervous?

369
00:32:35,933 --> 00:32:36,934
8 years.

370
00:32:37,726 --> 00:32:39,645
It's a life time, isn't it?

371
00:32:41,939 --> 00:32:46,944
Hello! Mr Decker, is it?
Yes.

372
00:32:46,944 --> 00:32:48,946
Hello there, I'm Declan Mulqueen.

373
00:32:48,946 --> 00:32:54,326
And this is Major Koslova.
How do you do?

374
00:32:54,451 --> 00:32:59,415
We would like to speak to your wife.

375
00:32:59,415 --> 00:33:38,412
Iss. Someone to see you!

376
00:33:38,704 --> 00:33:41,790
I'll take the kids out there.

377
00:33:45,711 --> 00:33:49,298
My beautiful Irish.

378
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:05,314
They have let me out to ask you something.

379
00:34:05,314 --> 00:34:13,322
Sir, I was thinking, maybe we could use
the woman as insurance....

380
00:34:13,322 --> 00:34:15,324
However he plays, we play it straight:

381
00:34:15,324 --> 00:34:18,327
Isabella Zanconas environment remains classified

382
00:34:18,327 --> 00:34:21,288
That means: nothing in the report.

383
00:34:21,288 --> 00:34:30,297
No name, no location. Nothing. Got it?
Yes sir.

384
00:34:30,297 --> 00:34:34,301
I've never known his name, but was definietly an American

385
00:34:34,301 --> 00:34:37,304
He had some kind of a...
special military training and he learnt Spanish

386
00:34:37,304 --> 00:34:39,306
in EI Salvador, I think...

387
00:34:39,306 --> 00:34:42,309
I didn't like talking to him

388
00:34:42,309 --> 00:34:45,312
I suppose, we were all dangerous people,

389
00:34:45,312 --> 00:34:47,314
but he was...different.

390
00:34:47,314 --> 00:34:51,318
I mean, Declan was fire, all passionate...

391
00:34:51,318 --> 00:34:54,321
But this man was ice.

392
00:34:54,321 --> 00:34:56,323
no feelings, nothing.

393
00:34:56,323 --> 00:34:58,325
O.k. Thank you Mrs Decker.

394
00:34:58,325 --> 00:34:59,326
You've been very helpfull.

395
00:34:59,326 --> 00:35:01,328
Incidentaly, it would be best

396
00:35:01,328 --> 00:35:04,290
if you'd keep our conversation
confidential even for your husband.

397
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:06,292
Don't worry about George.

398
00:35:06,292 --> 00:35:11,297
he doesn't know anything about my pass,
and he doesn't want to.

399
00:35:11,297 --> 00:35:20,306
All he needs to know is...that I love him.

400
00:35:20,306 --> 00:35:24,310
I see. Well, I thank you again.

401
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:32,318
I'll wait for you in the car.

402
00:35:32,318 --> 00:35:36,322
This opens a lock at Norfolk bus station

403
00:35:36,322 --> 00:35:41,327
Inside is a clean passport and 10000 dollars cash.

404
00:35:41,327 --> 00:35:45,289
Your friends left it with me
in case you have shown up

405
00:35:45,289 --> 00:35:48,292
Take it, and go back to Ireland.

406
00:35:48,292 --> 00:35:54,298
I cannot.

407
00:35:54,298 --> 00:35:59,303
You gave your word?

408
00:35:59,303 --> 00:36:00,304
Go now!

409
00:36:00,304 --> 00:36:01,305
You know, after he kills whoever he's after

410
00:36:01,305 --> 00:36:03,307
they'll send you back to prison.

411
00:36:04,558 --> 00:36:06,936
When I believed that, I'd use the key.

412
00:36:20,574 --> 00:36:22,576
Are you happy at least?

413
00:36:22,576 --> 00:36:23,577
Yes.

414
00:36:23,577 --> 00:36:27,539
I love my children...

415
00:36:27,539 --> 00:36:29,541
and my husband.

416
00:36:29,541 --> 00:36:40,552
In my way, I mean..

417
00:36:40,552 --> 00:36:44,556
Still at night I can close my eyes...

418
00:36:44,556 --> 00:36:47,559
and sleep...

419
00:36:47,559 --> 00:36:50,562
and no dead faces come to wake me.

420
00:36:50,562 --> 00:36:56,568
That is more than I ever had..

421
00:36:56,568 --> 00:37:02,574
You wouldn't have me give that up, would you?

422
00:37:02,574 --> 00:37:05,744
Give me some credit babe...

423
00:37:37,568 --> 00:37:44,575
She is Bask, isn't she?

424
00:37:44,575 --> 00:37:47,578
They say, Bask live by the vendetta.

425
00:37:47,578 --> 00:37:49,580
If they hate someone, it's to the death.

426
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:55,544
It's the same way, when they love...

427
00:37:55,544 --> 00:38:03,552
My first name is Valentina.

428
00:38:03,552 --> 00:38:06,555
Do you have family in Russia?

429
00:38:06,555 --> 00:38:10,559
My parents. My brother in the Navy.

430
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:13,562
Husband? Kids?

431
00:38:13,562 --> 00:38:18,567
No. I have not found the time.

432
00:38:18,567 --> 00:38:20,569
In truth...

433
00:38:20,569 --> 00:38:23,572
it's never been a conflict for me.

434
00:38:23,572 --> 00:38:34,541
This is not a quality a man looks for in the woman.

435
00:38:34,541 --> 00:38:35,542
By the way,

436
00:38:35,542 --> 00:38:38,545
Whatever lsabella gave you, after I left

437
00:38:38,545 --> 00:38:44,551
I trust you won't use that after our buissiness is concluded.

438
00:38:44,551 --> 00:38:47,554
You don't miss a thing, do you?

439
00:38:47,554 --> 00:38:48,555
No, Mr Mulqueen,

440
00:38:48,555 --> 00:39:01,568
I see everything.

441
00:39:01,568 --> 00:39:04,571
Maybe we should start by canceling you public appearances?

442
00:39:04,571 --> 00:39:07,574
No, no. I don't thing that's necessary. I mean not yet.

443
00:39:07,574 --> 00:39:17,543
Those fellows are gonna do same preparations
and they need time.

444
00:39:17,835 --> 00:39:19,837
Mr Mulqueen, something you'd like to share with us?

445
00:39:19,837 --> 00:39:22,840
He's likely to be using full of false identities

446
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:26,844
Three would be on him,
and one reserve in a dropbag somewhere

447
00:39:26,844 --> 00:39:28,846
This is how he used to operate.

448
00:39:28,846 --> 00:39:31,849
What matter if he has 40? It's still one man!

449
00:39:31,849 --> 00:39:33,851
We maight be creating a storm in a tea cup.

450
00:39:33,851 --> 00:39:37,855
Yea, yea... exactly...

451
00:39:37,855 --> 00:39:40,858
Direktor Bolitonov,

452
00:39:40,858 --> 00:39:44,862
Terek has always made doing his own killing a point of honour...

453
00:39:45,029 --> 00:39:47,031
usually very bloody and very public.

454
00:39:47,031 --> 00:39:49,033
A "Statement", if you wish.

455
00:39:49,033 --> 00:39:51,035
So, if he's hiding outside there

456
00:39:51,035 --> 00:39:55,039
obviously this is something he takes very seriously.

457
00:39:55,039 --> 00:39:58,000
Untill this Jackal is captured or killed,

458
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,003
I don't think we can afford to do the less.

459
00:40:01,003 --> 00:40:04,006
Ah come on, let's get real...
Hey, I mean - it's one guy.

460
00:40:04,006 --> 00:40:06,008
It's just one guy. Bolitonov's right!

461
00:40:06,008 --> 00:40:09,011
But with the assets in this room, the guy is good as god.

462
00:40:09,011 --> 00:40:13,015
As if he does stick his dick in a ring...

463
00:40:13,015 --> 00:40:18,020
like a lot of this clowns...

464
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:20,022
What's that Mr Mulqueen ?

465
00:40:20,022 --> 00:40:23,025
Sorry, Mr Brown.This man is not a clown.

466
00:40:23,025 --> 00:40:28,030
He knows all your moves back to front.

467
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:30,032
You have a name. That's all you're at!

468
00:40:30,032 --> 00:40:32,034
So the Jackal has got a target.
You!

469
00:40:32,034 --> 00:40:33,035
He's got the timetable.

470
00:40:33,035 --> 00:40:36,038
And as to making mistakes, he spent 20 years

471
00:40:36,038 --> 00:40:41,001
in a trade that doesn't forgive error!

472
00:40:41,001 --> 00:40:44,004
Do you think he's vulnerable up against us?

473
00:40:44,004 --> 00:41:49,028
Set the way round.

474
00:41:49,028 --> 00:42:05,002
Hi. Can I buy you a drink?
Yea.

475
00:42:05,002 --> 00:42:09,006
Maybe you should come home with me?

476
00:42:09,006 --> 00:42:13,010
I'd love to.

477
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:16,013
But I can't.

478
00:42:16,013 --> 00:42:21,018
I have to go back to Atlanta...

479
00:42:21,018 --> 00:42:23,020
Does she know?

480
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:29,026
She does now.

481
00:42:29,026 --> 00:42:31,028
So, how am I gonna see you again?

482
00:42:31,028 --> 00:42:39,036
You can give me one of your cards.

483
00:42:39,036 --> 00:42:47,002
You're not gonna call.

484
00:42:47,002 --> 00:42:49,004
You just have to have a little faith in people, thats all.

485
00:42:49,004 --> 00:44:04,038
Like I do.

486
00:44:04,038 --> 00:44:08,000
Open your shirt.

487
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,003
Easy...

488
00:44:11,003 --> 00:44:15,007
Now!

489
00:44:15,007 --> 00:44:17,009
Easy...

490
00:44:17,009 --> 00:44:29,021
Open your shirt...

491
00:44:29,021 --> 00:44:36,028
Souvenires... British hospitality.

492
00:44:36,028 --> 00:44:43,035
I apologize

493
00:44:43,035 --> 00:44:43,035
No problem.

494
00:44:43,035 --> 00:44:47,039
Oslo travel came up with James William Hayslip,

495
00:44:47,039 --> 00:44:48,999
he flew from Toronto on August 25th.
Two days before meeting with Terek.

496
00:44:48,999 --> 00:44:52,002
We checked the social-security number on his passport,

497
00:44:52,002 --> 00:44:56,006
and guess what.

498
00:44:56,006 --> 00:45:00,010
They belonged to an inmate commited to a mental institution in Virginia

499
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:02,012
twelve years ago.

500
00:45:02,012 --> 00:45:04,014
Now, Canadian travels says

501
00:45:04,014 --> 00:45:06,016
he flew to Montreal.

502
00:45:06,016 --> 00:46:00,029
Nine days ago.

503
00:46:00,029 --> 00:46:02,031
Charlie Murdock.

504
00:46:02,031 --> 00:46:07,036
I think I have a delivery yet.

505
00:46:07,036 --> 00:47:17,022
Yes, yes.

506
00:47:17,022 --> 00:47:19,024
Hi! I need to use one of your computers.

507
00:47:19,024 --> 00:47:26,031
Sure. Anyone.

508
00:47:26,031 --> 00:47:28,033
Can I get online with this?

509
00:47:28,033 --> 00:51:51,005
Yeah, sure.

510
00:51:51,005 --> 00:51:52,006
Thank you. Hayslip has dissapeared.

511
00:51:52,006 --> 00:51:57,011
A border patrol has his passport photo,
but nothing has shown up yet.

512
00:51:57,011 --> 00:52:01,015
He's moved on. I told you.
One moment.

513
00:52:01,015 --> 00:52:03,017
Only place for sure he has been is Montreal.

514
00:52:03,017 --> 00:52:07,021
What if he started the next identity there?

515
00:52:07,021 --> 00:52:09,023
I'm not following you.

516
00:52:09,023 --> 00:52:13,027
Hayslip's dissapeared, but that doesn't mean the Jackal though.

517
00:52:13,027 --> 00:52:16,030
Perhaps something has happened.

518
00:52:16,030 --> 00:52:18,032
Witherspoon,

519
00:52:18,032 --> 00:52:20,034
Have the Montreal Police
goes through their logs for the last 48 hours.

520
00:52:20,034 --> 00:52:22,036
If he signed to the next name, because it's in the plan?

521
00:52:22,036 --> 00:52:25,998
Man like this doesn't make mistakes.

522
00:52:25,998 --> 00:52:28,000
No. They always make one. Somewhere.

523
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:42,014
Isn't that how you were caught?

524
00:52:42,014 --> 00:52:45,017
What's our story...?

525
00:52:45,017 --> 00:52:48,020
Major Koslova...

526
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:50,022
ends the debate about women in combat.
As far as I'm concerned.

527
00:52:50,022 --> 00:52:52,024
How is that?

528
00:52:52,024 --> 00:52:57,029
When she saved my life and took out Terek's brother.

529
00:52:57,029 --> 00:53:02,034
She did it knowing she would be drawing
a death sentence down there...

530
00:53:02,034 --> 00:53:03,035
But when we offered

531
00:53:03,035 --> 00:53:06,038
settle her up at some place elswhere,
when this is over...

532
00:53:06,038 --> 00:53:08,999
You know what she said?

533
00:53:08,999 --> 00:53:15,005
The good guys don't hide.

534
00:53:15,005 --> 00:53:17,007
Fearless woman.

535
00:53:17,007 --> 00:53:21,011
In that country... under that system...

536
00:53:21,011 --> 00:53:29,019
staggering.

537
00:53:29,019 --> 00:53:31,021
Oh shit, you know what? I couldn't get titanium,

538
00:53:31,021 --> 00:53:33,023
so I had a friend of mine mould the base
at carbon fibres instead.

539
00:53:33,023 --> 00:53:36,026
It came at 23 kilos down of the weight you wanted.

540
00:53:36,026 --> 00:53:37,027
Is that cool?

541
00:53:37,027 --> 00:53:39,029
Yes, it's great.

542
00:53:39,029 --> 00:53:48,038
But I still want the planes,
the mould and the scratch material.

543
00:53:48,038 --> 00:53:49,999
Yeah... maybe we...are to talk about that once more.

544
00:53:49,999 --> 00:53:54,003
You see, this rig...

545
00:53:54,003 --> 00:54:00,009
I figure it's to support something really heavy.

546
00:54:00,009 --> 00:54:03,012
Like a... gatling gun maybe?

547
00:54:03,012 --> 00:54:05,014
Or a... 20 millimetre cannon?

548
00:54:05,014 --> 00:54:08,017
So, you gotta be sure
that it's really something big, right?

549
00:54:08,017 --> 00:54:14,023
Armoured car, maybe?

550
00:54:14,023 --> 00:54:19,028
I don't know! You know, you gotta be sure the fucken...

551
00:54:19,028 --> 00:54:26,035
But a.... the point is... a job like this can atract a lot of attention.

552
00:54:26,035 --> 00:54:27,036
I don't want an attention...

553
00:54:27,036 --> 00:54:30,998
Right, right... and that's what I'm saying,

554
00:54:30,998 --> 00:54:34,001
I think the plans and the mould were a little bonus.

555
00:54:34,001 --> 00:54:38,005
How much?
I don't know...

556
00:54:38,005 --> 00:54:43,010
100 grand?

557
00:54:43,010 --> 00:54:59,026
Come on man, you know it's worth it.
You've got a serious piece of equipement there.

558
00:54:59,026 --> 00:55:02,029
Alright. I'll give you 50 grand tomorrow.

559
00:55:02,029 --> 00:55:05,032
I need a place to test it, though.
Some place that won't draw any attention.

560
00:55:05,032 --> 00:55:24,009
We have place like that, we have place just like that.

561
00:55:24,009 --> 00:55:28,013
Target's at place.

562
00:55:28,013 --> 00:55:36,021
You know, I should have brought some beer.

563
00:55:36,021 --> 00:55:38,023
Motherfucker...

564
00:55:38,023 --> 00:55:41,026
That motherfucker

565
00:55:41,026 --> 00:55:44,029
is a state of the art!

566
00:55:44,029 --> 00:55:46,031
I knew it's gonna be big,

567
00:55:46,031 --> 00:55:48,033
but I didn't know it's gonna be
the fucken prototype cannon!

568
00:55:48,033 --> 00:55:52,037
It's a fucken monstrum!

569
00:55:52,037 --> 00:55:58,002
Man, look at the rounds.
Made from the uranium.

570
00:55:58,002 --> 00:56:03,007
Once they get inside, they just spatter.
Yeah?

571
00:56:03,007 --> 00:56:05,009
They get in there and...

572
00:56:05,009 --> 00:56:07,011
That rocks!

573
00:56:07,011 --> 00:56:11,015
Look at the phreacking lens on that thing.
Don't touch that!

574
00:56:11,015 --> 00:56:16,020
They're like 2.000 mile-zoom-lense.

575
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:18,022
Is this thing a prototype, or what?

576
00:56:18,022 --> 00:56:24,028
I bet it has cost you a shit load! That rocks!

577
00:56:24,028 --> 00:56:49,011
You know, what I'm saying? It kicks ass.

578
00:56:49,011 --> 00:56:52,014
I can't wait to see...
Lamont!

579
00:56:52,014 --> 00:57:32,012
Close your mouth.

580
00:57:32,012 --> 00:57:49,029
O.k.?

581
00:57:49,029 --> 00:57:51,031
Well, at least...

582
00:57:51,031 --> 00:57:52,032
you took out the target.

583
00:57:52,032 --> 00:57:54,034
No, it's off.

584
00:57:54,034 --> 00:57:57,037
By at least 3 millimeters.

585
00:57:57,037 --> 00:58:01,000
No, that's precision craftsmanship.

586
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:06,005
So Lamont, tell me how to set this thing automatically.

587
00:58:06,005 --> 00:58:08,007
You just...

588
00:58:08,007 --> 00:58:12,011
touch a wind-correction and elevation, and hit enter.

589
00:58:12,011 --> 00:58:18,017
So you just a... estimate it, huh?

590
00:58:18,017 --> 00:58:26,025
And hit enter?

591
00:58:26,025 --> 00:58:30,029
I give up!

592
00:58:30,029 --> 00:58:32,031
I guess the automatic siding works.

593
00:58:32,031 --> 00:58:33,032
is about to sprawl...

594
00:58:33,032 --> 00:58:35,034
Well Lamont,

595
00:58:35,034 --> 00:58:40,998
Let's speed-test it now.
Speed-test.

596
00:58:40,998 --> 00:58:47,004
So... run!

597
00:58:47,004 --> 00:58:49,006
What do you mean?

598
00:58:49,006 --> 00:59:10,027
I mean run.
Now!

599
00:59:10,027 --> 00:59:39,014
Run to your right!

600
00:59:39,014 --> 00:59:44,019
Get up!

601
00:59:44,019 --> 00:59:48,023
Just stop there!

602
00:59:48,023 --> 00:59:59,034
Get up!

603
00:59:59,034 --> 01:00:06,000
Hold that pack of cigarettes. Don't be afraid!

604
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:19,013
Stand very still!

605
01:00:19,013 --> 01:00:37,031
Stand still !

606
01:00:37,031 --> 01:00:43,037
I told you, that was off.

607
01:00:43,037 --> 01:01:41,011
Move over by the car!
Quick!

608
01:01:41,011 --> 01:01:45,015
Here it goes Sir..

609
01:01:45,015 --> 01:01:47,017
Eleven days ago Charles C. Murdock...

610
01:01:47,017 --> 01:01:50,020
bought himself a brand new Dodge Minivan.

611
01:01:50,020 --> 01:01:52,022
Now! That was a big surprise for Mr. Murdock,

612
01:01:52,022 --> 01:01:58,028
whose passport and wallet
were stolen 16 days ago at the Helsinki-Airport.

613
01:01:58,028 --> 01:01:59,029
Anything from the border?

614
01:01:59,029 --> 01:02:02,032
We have sent the description of the van to every crossing...

615
01:02:02,032 --> 01:02:05,035
I have something. Uphall Station.
It is a small town outside Ottawa.

616
01:02:05,035 --> 01:02:24,013
I think your man has been there.
Let's go.

617
01:02:24,013 --> 01:02:44,033
The owner is lan Lamont...

618
01:02:44,033 --> 01:02:50,998
Hello! I think I got something here.

619
01:02:50,998 --> 01:02:53,000
What is it?

620
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:57,004
This is a remote firing station.

621
01:02:57,004 --> 01:03:00,007
It manoeuvres a weapon,
the servo is on of a... remote control.

622
01:03:00,007 --> 01:03:02,009
Like a... like a model aeroplane.

623
01:03:02,009 --> 01:03:06,013
We used that things for models or a...
But nothing like... this size!

624
01:03:06,013 --> 01:03:09,016
He needs a van, just to move around.

625
01:03:09,016 --> 01:03:13,020
What would something of this size be used for?

626
01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:16,023
Antiaircraft?
No! You can buy them...

627
01:03:16,023 --> 01:03:18,025
Missiles are best for the aircraft.

628
01:03:18,025 --> 01:03:20,027
This was something else...

629
01:03:20,027 --> 01:03:23,030
Something with one hell of a range!

630
01:03:23,030 --> 01:03:26,033
Not just a range, though.

631
01:03:26,033 --> 01:03:29,036
See, this is a gun, It's a cyclic rate.

632
01:03:29,036 --> 01:03:36,001
It sends out a hundred bullets,
before the first one reaches the target.

633
01:03:36,001 --> 01:03:39,004
The thing about boats like this, is it sells itself.

634
01:03:39,004 --> 01:03:44,009
It has a lot for the money.

635
01:03:44,009 --> 01:03:48,013
It's got radar, GPS, autopilot, autotackle...

636
01:03:48,013 --> 01:03:54,019
This has even a cellular phone.
You can call your wife if you want to...

637
01:03:54,019 --> 01:04:03,028
So, what you think?

638
01:04:03,028 --> 01:05:49,009
Deja vu. She is perfect.

639
01:05:49,009 --> 01:05:51,011
Jackal.

640
01:05:51,011 --> 01:05:57,017
They know you were in Canada,
and have an Irish who is helping them.

641
01:05:57,017 --> 01:06:01,021
The Irishman's name?
Mulqueen.

642
01:06:01,021 --> 01:06:06,026
Declan Mulqueen? Declan Mulqueen.

643
01:06:06,026 --> 01:06:11,031
The operation still at go.

644
01:06:11,031 --> 01:06:14,034
Declan.

645
01:06:14,034 --> 01:06:16,036
The crossing points and airports have his photograph

646
01:06:16,036 --> 01:06:18,038
but R.M.C.P. has nothing.

647
01:06:18,038 --> 01:06:21,000
On our side the boarder patrol and I.N.S.
are both in a highest alert.

648
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,002
Again. Nothing.

649
01:06:23,002 --> 01:06:25,004
But let's face it. Don't be Houdini to make a cross from Canada.

650
01:06:25,004 --> 01:06:27,006
Probably walking cross for Christ sake.

651
01:06:27,006 --> 01:06:31,010
He won't be walking, I can tell you that.
He's got a weapon to move.

652
01:06:31,010 --> 01:06:36,015
What kind of patrol do you have on this?
the Great Lakes?

653
01:06:36,015 --> 01:06:40,019
Not a lot. No need. People either fly or drive.

654
01:06:40,019 --> 01:06:44,023
There are a few ferry services,
but we checked those, as well

655
01:06:44,023 --> 01:06:46,025
What about people with boats?

656
01:06:46,025 --> 01:06:48,027
What kind of emigration controls they have?

657
01:06:48,027 --> 01:06:51,030
Arriving vessels have to check at the harbour.

658
01:06:51,030 --> 01:06:57,036
Hmm...voluntarily?
Yeah. No active enforcement.

659
01:06:57,036 --> 01:07:00,998
Say he does use a boat
he still wanna..mix with others.

660
01:07:00,998 --> 01:07:04,001
Are there any gatherings to speak of?

661
01:07:04,001 --> 01:07:06,003
Yeah, the Mackinaw-Regatta is going on.

662
01:07:06,003 --> 01:07:08,005
It's the biggest regatta on Lake Michigan.

663
01:07:08,005 --> 01:07:10,007
From where to were?

664
01:07:10,007 --> 01:08:21,036
It starts in Mackinaw and it ends in Chicago.

665
01:08:21,036 --> 01:08:24,999
Witherspoon, take Waveland.

666
01:08:24,999 --> 01:08:27,001
Declan, Valentina, Chicago-Yachtklub.

667
01:08:27,001 --> 01:08:29,003
I'll take the locals.

668
01:08:29,003 --> 01:08:33,007
And remember, he would be on Ontario registered boat.

669
01:08:33,007 --> 01:08:34,008
So look at everything and stay on your radios.

670
01:08:34,008 --> 01:08:36,010
If you do find something, call in back.

671
01:08:36,010 --> 01:08:44,018
I want an arrest, not a firefight.

672
01:08:44,018 --> 01:08:49,023
Alright, lets get to it.

673
01:08:49,023 --> 01:08:53,027
Preston,what about let me have a gun?

674
01:08:53,027 --> 01:09:01,035
Are you crazy?

675
01:09:01,035 --> 01:09:08,000
a fucking gun...

676
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,002
So many people.
So many rich people.

677
01:09:10,002 --> 01:09:14,006
Shall we dance?

678
01:09:14,006 --> 01:10:21,031
Would you give me a gun?

679
01:10:21,031 --> 01:10:25,035
Hi, want some chmpagne?
Come on, join us.

680
01:10:25,035 --> 01:12:48,012
Maybe later...

681
01:12:48,012 --> 01:13:12,036
Get out of the way!

682
01:13:12,036 --> 01:13:19,001
Preston, canI talk to you?

683
01:13:19,001 --> 01:13:21,003
Look, he saw me. He wasn't surprised!

684
01:13:21,003 --> 01:13:23,005
Like he was expecting me!

685
01:13:23,005 --> 01:13:27,009
One of your team is playing for the other side!

686
01:13:27,009 --> 01:13:29,011
Impossible! I can trust every man on tis team.
I'm telling you...

687
01:13:29,011 --> 01:13:31,013
This is not the IRA, we don't get into...

688
01:13:31,013 --> 01:13:34,016
Somebody got to...

689
01:13:34,016 --> 01:13:38,020
Look. This is a manhunt, not your Cause.

690
01:13:38,020 --> 01:13:40,022
Don't make it personal.

691
01:13:40,022 --> 01:13:51,033
What do you fucken know...

692
01:13:51,033 --> 01:13:53,035
I'll tell you, what I know...

693
01:13:53,035 --> 01:13:57,039
I know the Jackal set you up
in an arms deal in Lybia.

694
01:13:57,039 --> 01:14:01,001
I know Isabella was wounded,
when you walked into the trap.

695
01:14:01,001 --> 01:14:04,004
I also know, it was the buissiness...

696
01:14:04,004 --> 01:14:07,007
Do you also know, that Isabella was pregnant?

697
01:14:07,007 --> 01:14:14,014
That our child didn't survived!

698
01:14:14,014 --> 01:14:19,019
Don't tell me it's not personal!

699
01:14:19,019 --> 01:14:23,023
I can't let you jeopardize us! In a vendetta.

700
01:14:23,023 --> 01:14:34,034
There's no Vendetta.
I hope for a fresh start, you know...

701
01:14:34,034 --> 01:16:06,001
maybe it will happen...

702
01:16:06,001 --> 01:16:08,003
This was recorded at 1 a.m. this morning.

703
01:16:08,003 --> 01:16:14,009
It's a call to a number in Brighton Beach, New York.

704
01:16:14,009 --> 01:16:19,014
Item 4: at 1:05 p.m. Direktor Brown is scheduled
to meet the First Lady.

705
01:16:19,014 --> 01:16:21,016
diplomatic reception at the White House,

706
01:16:21,016 --> 01:16:29,024
regarding to a New Hope Hospital opening.

707
01:16:29,024 --> 01:16:34,029
That information came out of this room.

708
01:16:34,029 --> 01:16:44,039
Who? Whos voice is it? On the tape?

709
01:16:44,039 --> 01:16:49,003
Mine.

710
01:16:49,003 --> 01:16:51,005
Mr ambassador

711
01:16:51,005 --> 01:16:53,007
we have arranged the 9 p.m. Aeroflot flight to Moscow.

712
01:16:53,007 --> 01:17:14,028
A car is waiting to drive Colonel Bolitonov to the airport.

713
01:17:14,028 --> 01:17:16,030
how did you know, whose phone to tape?

714
01:17:16,030 --> 01:17:21,035
I didn't, so I taped everybidies.

715
01:17:21,035 --> 01:17:25,039
But I... I have diplomatic immunity.

716
01:17:25,039 --> 01:17:26,999
Who authorized you to tape my telephone?

717
01:17:26,999 --> 01:17:29,001
I did, ambassador.

718
01:17:29,001 --> 01:18:20,010
We are currently examining
documents taken from Direktor Bolitonovs Apartment.

719
01:18:20,010 --> 01:18:22,012
Jackal.

720
01:18:22,012 --> 01:18:26,016
Direktor Bolitonov is no longer contactable at this number.

721
01:18:26,016 --> 01:18:34,024
All inquiries should be forwarded to...

722
01:18:34,024 --> 01:18:37,027
This is only a precaution for a short while
untill we get this man.

723
01:18:37,027 --> 01:18:41,031
You and your family would be safer in Washington.

724
01:18:41,031 --> 01:18:45,035
You don't really think you'll find him,
because you won't. Belive me, you can't.

725
01:18:45,035 --> 01:18:52,001
It's my job to try.
Waste your time and maybe get killed for nothing?

726
01:18:52,001 --> 01:19:22,031
I began this. I have to do what I can.
So please, get your family away.

727
01:19:22,031 --> 01:19:26,035
Everything o.k.?
Valentina is evacuating Isabella family

728
01:19:26,035 --> 01:19:30,039
in case the Jackal knows, where she lives.

729
01:19:30,039 --> 01:19:34,001
Look, the Director doesn't even know
where Isabella lives.

730
01:19:34,001 --> 01:19:35,002
I ordered Witherspoon to keep it out of the report.

731
01:19:35,002 --> 01:19:39,006
No way the Jackal knows.

732
01:19:39,006 --> 01:19:43,010
Well, our Russian black heart
passed everything else, didn't he?

733
01:19:43,010 --> 01:19:46,013
Hier, look.

734
01:19:46,013 --> 01:19:50,017
That's your phone number,
that's Valentina's.

735
01:19:50,017 --> 01:19:54,021
Are you still at the bottom?

736
01:19:54,021 --> 01:19:58,025
The first one is a Russian Embassy.

737
01:19:58,025 --> 01:20:07,034
The second one is... son of a bitch!

738
01:20:07,034 --> 01:20:17,002
This is an FBI access code!

739
01:20:17,002 --> 01:20:19,004
This is Special Agent Carter Preston.

740
01:20:19,004 --> 01:20:22,007
Mine authorisation number is: 223578k

741
01:20:22,007 --> 01:20:26,011
I need a voice transcriptions
of field report November-Alpha...

742
01:20:26,011 --> 01:20:30,015
from 915 this year
Agent Witherspoon.

743
01:20:30,015 --> 01:20:35,020
And I'm in a hurry, operator.

744
01:20:35,020 --> 01:20:41,026
I shouldn't have trusted you.

745
01:20:41,026 --> 01:20:43,028
Field report November-Alpha,

746
01:20:43,028 --> 01:20:46,031
File 0900 hours
Scroll

747
01:20:46,031 --> 01:20:49,034
interviewed subject lsabella Zancona,

748
01:20:49,034 --> 01:21:11,015
at the following address...
Witherspoon,you fool ashole!

749
01:21:11,015 --> 01:21:41,003
I' gonna check upstairs.

750
01:21:41,003 --> 01:22:07,029
Witherspoon !

751
01:22:07,029 --> 01:22:11,033
Come out!

752
01:22:11,033 --> 01:22:13,035
Please don't shoot me.

753
01:22:13,035 --> 01:22:16,038
I'm just taking out the garbage.

754
01:22:16,038 --> 01:22:18,999
I've got to do one more trip.
Hurry!

755
01:22:18,999 --> 01:22:32,012
I meet you at the front.
Yes Madame.

756
01:22:32,012 --> 01:22:34,014
Were is Witherspoon?

757
01:22:34,014 --> 01:22:39,019
He's in the backyard, taking out the trash.

758
01:22:39,019 --> 01:22:56,036
It's comming from the back!

759
01:22:56,036 --> 01:22:58,038
Where is that commieng from?

760
01:22:58,038 --> 01:23:24,023
I don't know!

761
01:23:24,023 --> 01:23:32,031
It said to go of 2 minutes ago.
What the hell...

762
01:23:32,031 --> 01:25:34,028
Where is McMurphy?

763
01:25:34,028 --> 01:25:37,031
Press here.

764
01:25:37,031 --> 01:25:52,004
Hard. It's a load of bleeding.

765
01:25:52,004 --> 01:25:54,006
You see, that's bad...

766
01:25:54,006 --> 01:25:58,010
Blood is almost black, that means the bullet is in your liver.

767
01:25:58,010 --> 01:26:00,012
You have got about 20 minutes to live...

768
01:26:00,012 --> 01:26:05,017
Paining is too much, you can take your hand away.

769
01:26:05,017 --> 01:26:13,025
And you'll be...
dead in five minutes.

770
01:26:13,025 --> 01:26:15,027
When Declan kills you,

771
01:26:15,027 --> 01:26:24,036
you think of me, ok?

772
01:26:24,036 --> 01:26:27,998
Ok.... I'll make it...

773
01:26:27,998 --> 01:26:30,000
If you see Declan befor you die...
you tell him...

774
01:26:30,000 --> 01:27:13,002
that you can't pick up this woman.

775
01:27:13,002 --> 01:27:26,015
It will be fine.
...Declan...

776
01:27:26,015 --> 01:27:28,017
You're gonna be fine.

777
01:27:28,017 --> 01:27:30,019
I tried...

778
01:27:30,019 --> 01:27:34,023
help Isabella...

779
01:27:34,023 --> 01:27:37,026
Oh I know. You did fine. Shh....

780
01:27:37,026 --> 01:27:41,030
He said to tell you,

781
01:27:41,030 --> 01:27:43,032
You...

782
01:27:43,032 --> 01:27:54,001
cannot protect your woman.

783
01:27:54,001 --> 01:27:56,003
No Valentina!

784
01:27:56,003 --> 01:27:58,005
No don't Valentina... don't go!

785
01:27:58,005 --> 01:28:54,019
Stay with me!

786
01:28:54,019 --> 01:28:58,023
Oh, Declan...it was him, wasn't it?

787
01:28:58,023 --> 01:29:03,028
I thought, it was all behind us...

788
01:29:03,028 --> 01:29:06,031
Oh... is this ever gonna end?

789
01:29:06,031 --> 01:29:08,033
Yes.

790
01:29:08,033 --> 01:29:14,039
I promise you, it will end.

791
01:29:14,039 --> 01:29:21,005
And I will end it.

792
01:29:21,005 --> 01:29:42,026
Do you have a gun?

793
01:29:42,026 --> 01:29:44,028
Fallowing a lot of helicopter searching...

794
01:29:44,028 --> 01:29:46,030
the team can infiltrate the weapon to a point here...

795
01:29:46,030 --> 01:29:50,034
covering the Northern approaches in "Route One".

796
01:29:50,034 --> 01:29:53,037
If your weapon has needed range and cyclic rate...

797
01:29:53,037 --> 01:29:56,999
you can engage any ground vehicle
and aircraft approaching the place.

798
01:29:56,999 --> 01:29:59,001
He doesn't have a helicopter
or a team to help him set off.

799
01:29:59,001 --> 01:30:03,005
He is alone.

800
01:30:03,005 --> 01:30:06,008
What do you say, Mulqueen?

801
01:30:06,008 --> 01:30:12,014
...the only way you can make the killer escape from a distance.

802
01:30:12,014 --> 01:30:14,016
So, we'll make sure you're always secure, indoors...

803
01:30:14,016 --> 01:30:18,020
with the cordon of men outside your location.

804
01:30:18,020 --> 01:30:21,023
Exactly.

805
01:30:21,023 --> 01:30:25,027
tieing a knot, if you like.

806
01:30:25,027 --> 01:30:25,027
If he make his move,

807
01:30:25,027 --> 01:30:29,031
we'll tie the knot and we'll hang him.

808
01:30:29,031 --> 01:30:31,033
Not exactly foolproof, I know...

809
01:30:31,033 --> 01:30:40,000
But it's the best regard.
Best regard?

810
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:46,006
You have a call on line 6.
Thank you.

811
01:30:46,006 --> 01:30:48,008
this is Doug.

812
01:30:48,008 --> 01:30:51,011
I told you I'd call...

813
01:30:51,011 --> 01:30:51,011
Oh... how are you?

814
01:30:51,011 --> 01:30:57,017
You just have got to have
a little faith in people, Douglas.

815
01:30:57,017 --> 01:30:59,019
O.k., noe, that I have a faith...

816
01:30:59,019 --> 01:31:27,006
Are you busy tonight? Are you here? You're in town, yes?

817
01:31:27,006 --> 01:31:33,012
Hello! I am home!

818
01:31:33,012 --> 01:31:36,015
I see you have found the keys.

819
01:31:36,015 --> 01:31:38,017
Where are you?

820
01:31:38,017 --> 01:31:51,030
In the garage!

821
01:31:51,030 --> 01:31:55,034
You changed your hair.

822
01:31:55,034 --> 01:31:59,038
Yeah, like it?

823
01:31:59,038 --> 01:32:05,002
Yes, sure.

824
01:32:05,002 --> 01:32:08,005
Do you like Korean food?

825
01:32:08,005 --> 01:32:10,007
Oh, sure, yeah.

826
01:32:10,007 --> 01:32:16,013
Take it.

827
01:32:16,013 --> 01:32:23,020
I... I thought we're gonna...
Oh, I'm sorry.

828
01:32:23,020 --> 01:32:27,024
I thought we were gonna go out.

829
01:32:27,024 --> 01:32:33,030
Yea...maybe later.

830
01:32:33,030 --> 01:32:35,032
We are covering tonight Top-Story:

831
01:32:35,032 --> 01:32:38,035
Police is asking your help on locating this man.

832
01:32:38,035 --> 01:32:42,039
He is wanted in several states
for a serie of brutal murders.

833
01:32:42,039 --> 01:32:43,999
The Police belive he is in Washington area, tonight.

834
01:32:43,999 --> 01:32:46,001
The man is supposed to be armed and extremaly dangerous.

835
01:32:46,001 --> 01:34:14,006
If you see him, please do not approach him.
And notify authorities, immediately.

836
01:34:14,006 --> 01:34:18,010
Donald Kennedy said once, that if somebody want's to kill...

837
01:34:18,010 --> 01:34:20,012
a public official...

838
01:34:20,012 --> 01:34:23,015
it's impossible to provide a 100% safety.

839
01:34:23,015 --> 01:34:27,019
Would you agree?

840
01:34:27,019 --> 01:34:29,021
Certainly!

841
01:34:29,021 --> 01:34:35,027
but hopefully there aren't many people willing to do that...

842
01:34:35,027 --> 01:34:38,030
Preston!
What?

843
01:34:38,030 --> 01:34:42,034
You remember Valentina said:
"A statement, public and brutal".

844
01:34:42,034 --> 01:34:44,036
It has always bothered me, why does he keep comming?

845
01:34:44,036 --> 01:34:47,998
Well, he knew... he knew we can protect the director,
as long as I get involved.

846
01:34:47,998 --> 01:34:50,000
But he didn't abort!
Why?

847
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:53,003
It didn't come together, untill I remembered
what he said to Valentina...

848
01:34:53,003 --> 01:34:55,005
"tell Declan, he can't protect his women"

849
01:34:55,005 --> 01:34:59,009
Wasn't he refering to lsabella?

850
01:34:59,009 --> 01:34:59,009
Any woman. All women!

851
01:34:59,009 --> 01:35:03,013
but remember:
"public and brutal".

852
01:35:03,013 --> 01:35:06,016
We're garding the wrong person.

853
01:35:06,016 --> 01:36:29,016
He's after the First Lady.

854
01:36:29,016 --> 01:36:33,020
Ladies and Gentelman...

855
01:36:33,020 --> 01:36:57,002
Welcome! I am sure you...

856
01:36:57,002 --> 01:36:59,004
She is already on the stage!

857
01:36:59,004 --> 01:37:01,006
The Secret Service wants to know,
what is going on.

858
01:37:01,006 --> 01:37:03,008
Tell them!
No!

859
01:37:03,008 --> 01:37:44,008
They'll try to get her of the stage.
He will shoot in the crowd!

860
01:37:44,008 --> 01:37:48,012
We are looking for a dark brown minivan..

861
01:37:48,012 --> 01:37:51,015
The only one here is red...

862
01:37:51,015 --> 01:37:57,021
I checked that about 15 minutes ago. There are local parked...

863
01:37:57,021 --> 01:37:57,021
I will check that out again, if you want.

864
01:37:57,021 --> 01:38:01,025
No. It's probably one of the safe and sorry circle jerk...

865
01:38:01,025 --> 01:38:23,005
Yeah...

866
01:38:23,005 --> 01:38:25,007
The Secret Service said,
the search came at nothing.

867
01:38:25,007 --> 01:38:29,011
They're on alert,
but she's going to the podium!

868
01:38:29,011 --> 01:38:36,018
I guess it's all on us!

869
01:38:36,018 --> 01:38:48,030
You'll need a gun!

870
01:38:48,030 --> 01:38:50,032
Forget the laser!

871
01:38:50,032 --> 01:40:10,029
Got to work with the optic...at this range.

872
01:40:10,029 --> 01:40:29,006
Get out!

873
01:40:29,006 --> 01:40:31,008
I am going for the First Lady.

874
01:40:31,008 --> 01:40:40,017
It's going to be hard to shoot on the weapon on the system.

875
01:40:40,017 --> 01:40:42,019
Ladies and Gentalmen, it's a great pleasure to introduce

876
01:40:42,019 --> 01:40:53,030
the First Lady of the United States...

877
01:40:53,030 --> 01:41:51,005
It's a beautiful day for the beginning of the new hope...

878
01:41:51,005 --> 01:42:10,024
Give me the gun!

879
01:42:10,024 --> 01:42:14,028
It's that how he plans to get out.

880
01:42:14,028 --> 01:42:33,005
The phone, give me the phone!

881
01:42:33,005 --> 01:42:35,007
And also right now...

882
01:42:35,007 --> 01:42:38,010
there are Police officers, risking their very lifes

883
01:42:38,010 --> 01:43:05,037
to help kids stay out of troubles...

884
01:43:05,037 --> 01:43:06,038
Red minivan,
There by the trees.

885
01:43:06,038 --> 01:43:10,000
One o'clock!

886
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,002
Jesus!
Range it...

887
01:43:12,002 --> 01:43:14,004
750...

888
01:43:14,004 --> 01:44:01,010
762 meter!

889
01:44:01,010 --> 01:44:05,180
Right, I am after him!
You check up the minivan!

890
01:50:33,027 --> 01:51:23,035
Get out! Get out of here!

891
01:51:23,035 --> 01:51:53,023
Say: "Help me Declan"!
Please, help me Declan!

892
01:51:53,023 --> 01:51:53,023
Loud!

893
01:51:53,023 --> 01:52:08,038
Help me, Declan!
Please! Declan, help me!

894
01:52:08,038 --> 01:52:09,999
What you gonna do, Declan?

895
01:52:09,999 --> 01:52:14,003
You just can't protect any of your women!

896
01:52:14,003 --> 01:52:16,005
Let her go!
She has nothing to do with this!

897
01:52:16,005 --> 01:52:18,007
Now, you can save this girl!

898
01:52:18,007 --> 01:52:21,010
What's your name?
Maggie.

899
01:52:21,010 --> 01:52:23,012
You can save Maggie, you see?

900
01:52:23,012 --> 01:52:25,014
You can save her right now!

901
01:52:25,014 --> 01:52:48,037
You just have to put down your little gun!

902
01:52:48,037 --> 01:52:55,002
Okay?
Declan!?

903
01:52:55,002 --> 01:53:03,010
Oh..you did so good, you did so good!

904
01:53:03,010 --> 01:53:12,019
You slip it, Declan.

905
01:53:12,019 --> 01:53:14,021
Now, let her go.

906
01:53:14,021 --> 01:53:16,023
You step away from the gun.

907
01:53:16,023 --> 01:53:21,028
Step away from the gun!

908
01:53:21,028 --> 01:53:21,028
Maggie,

909
01:53:21,028 --> 01:53:23,030
you're so brave.

910
01:53:23,030 --> 01:53:32,998
You'll remember this for the rest of your life.

911
01:53:32,998 --> 01:53:38,003
Get down.

912
01:53:38,003 --> 01:54:06,031
Kneel down.

913
01:54:06,031 --> 01:55:31,033
I'm sorry, Declan.

914
01:55:31,033 --> 01:56:31,010
It's alright, it's okay.

915
01:56:31,010 --> 01:56:33,012
I wonder if we'll ever know

916
01:56:33,012 --> 01:56:36,015
who the hell he really was.

917
01:56:36,015 --> 01:56:40,019
We know what we need to.
He was evil.

918
01:56:40,019 --> 01:56:46,025
he is dead, and he is gone.
Nothing more about it.

919
01:56:46,025 --> 01:56:48,027
Sorry I didn't give you an apartament.

920
01:56:48,027 --> 01:56:51,030
You will get the minimum security. Just like a Country Club.

921
01:56:51,030 --> 01:56:53,032
By the way...

922
01:56:53,032 --> 01:56:55,034
Direktor Brown sends his warmest thanks.

923
01:56:55,034 --> 01:56:57,036
Oh... that's nice.

924
01:56:57,036 --> 01:57:01,999
I look forward to play tennis with him.

925
01:57:01,999 --> 01:57:04,001
Did I tell you I'm going back to Russia?

926
01:57:04,001 --> 01:57:07,004
And I'm going to stay untills Terek Murad
rocks in prison...

927
01:57:07,004 --> 01:57:09,006
or in the grave!

928
01:57:09,006 --> 01:57:12,009
She'd appreciate that..

929
01:57:12,009 --> 01:57:15,012
I think so.

930
01:57:15,012 --> 01:57:17,014
And lsabella ?

931
01:57:17,014 --> 01:57:21,018
Back safe, with the family.

932
01:57:21,018 --> 01:57:23,020
For good.

933
01:57:23,020 --> 01:57:26,023
I know about that key she gave you...

934
01:57:26,023 --> 01:57:30,027
I know you could use it any time you wanted to...

935
01:57:30,027 --> 01:57:33,030
Do you have one of those drop-boxes, too?

936
01:57:33,030 --> 01:57:36,033
Like the Jackal?

937
01:57:36,033 --> 01:57:39,036
Did you read the paper today?
I'm quite a hero, because of you.

938
01:57:39,036 --> 01:57:42,998
The agent, who saved the First Lady.

939
01:57:42,998 --> 01:57:47,002
I could screw everything else up for the rest of my life...

940
01:57:47,002 --> 01:57:50,005
and I'd still be...untouchable.

941
01:57:50,005 --> 01:57:53,008
Is that a fact, then?

942
01:57:53,008 --> 01:57:56,011
Going back to the drop-box...

943
01:57:56,011 --> 01:57:59,014
An operative, with your experience...

944
01:57:59,014 --> 01:58:01,016
with a clean passport...

945
01:58:01,016 --> 01:58:04,019
and a lot of cash.

946
01:58:04,019 --> 01:58:10,025
I bet, if you had taken off...

947
01:58:10,025 --> 01:58:16,031
we never would have found you.

948
01:58:16,031 --> 01:58:19,034
Do you drink coffe?

949
01:58:19,034 --> 01:58:22,037
Oh no, that's right.
They drink Guinness in lrland.

950
01:58:22,037 --> 01:58:24,999
I'll... ask across the street, if they've got any...

951
01:58:24,999 --> 01:58:27,001
coffe, I mean...

952
01:58:27,001 --> 01:58:29,003
I'll be back in...

953
01:58:29,003 --> 01:58:39,013
30 minutes?
Okay.

954
01:58:39,013 --> 01:58:42,016
Thanks Declan, for everything.

955
01:58:43,016 --> 01:58:53,016
