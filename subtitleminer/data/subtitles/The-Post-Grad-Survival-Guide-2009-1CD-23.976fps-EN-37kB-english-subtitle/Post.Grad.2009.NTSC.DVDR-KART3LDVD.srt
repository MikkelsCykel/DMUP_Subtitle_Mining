1
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:01,559
Hey! It's me again.

2
00:01:01,628 --> 00:01:05,621
This is a very special day.
This is day 756...

3
00:01:05,698 --> 00:01:07,791
of my college experience...

4
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:11,166
otherwise known as... graduation day!

5
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:13,671
Whoo! Ah!

6
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,938
Wait for it.
I got the whole outfit. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Hmm.

7
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:21,970
I have been planning
for this day for my entire life.

8
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:24,482
<i>- Um, when I was a kid, I devised
this plan... -</i>

9
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:26,951
that I cleverly called "The Plan."

10
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:31,917
Uh, " Dad can't make it to graduation today.
Big shocker.

11
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:33,925
Can I join you guys for lunch?"

12
00:01:33,993 --> 00:01:35,551
Absolutely.

13
00:01:35,628 --> 00:01:39,621
This is great, because nobody
runs parental interference quite like Adam.

14
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:41,633
We've been best friends since freshman year.

15
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:44,363
# This is Ryden's study song #

16
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:46,871
# I worked on it so damn long #

17
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,374
# It's to give encouragement #

18
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:52,309
# For your big test today #

19
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:55,245
<i>Anyway, the plan is pretty straightforward.</i>

20
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:57,374
<i>One, kick ass in high school...</i>

21
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,613
<i>so that I can get...
two... a fatty scholarship.</i>

22
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:03,885
<i>Three, limit my beer pong enough...</i>

23
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:06,551
<i>to keep said scholarship,
which I did, and...</i>

24
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:09,417
Oh.

25
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:11,430
Hi, Ryden. Jessica Bard here.

26
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:13,432
Just wanted to clean the slate.

27
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,434
I'm sorry I nabbed valedictorian...

28
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:17,697
but you have to believe
I will do an excellent job.

29
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:21,706
Jessica Bard... my own personal Darth Vader
since the third grade.

30
00:02:21,774 --> 00:02:25,403
Back to the master plan.

31
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:29,414
Number four. Most importantly...

32
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:33,748
<i>land a sweet job at the finest
publishing house in all of L. A...</i>

33
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,880
Happerman & Browning,
where I will no doubt...

34
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:39,015
discover the next great American novel.

35
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:42,755
All right.
So that's the plan. This is it.

36
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:47,391
Malby signing off, about to embark on
the first day of the rest of my life.

37
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:51,426
And, hey,
if you're at graduation, come say hi.

38
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:55,340
I'll be the one in black. Bye!

39
00:02:57,043 --> 00:03:00,069
<i># You stumble down a yellow brick road #</i>

40
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:04,947

41

55
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:53,590
<i>Jessica Bard, with
tonight's keynote address.</i>

56
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,634
<i>All right, Jessica!</i>

57
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,302
<i>Rock on, Jessie!</i>

58
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:06,139
Class of 2009, it is my great honor...

59
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:09,773
to welcome you to this evening's
graduation ceremony.

60
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:14,912
<i>I stand before you with two age-old words:
Carpe diem.</i>

61
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:17,855
<i>When we walk out these doors...</i>

62
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:22,520
<i>I challenge each of us
to not only seize the day...</i>

63
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:25,086
<i>but to clutch it with both hands.</i>

64
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:26,791
<i>- You go first.
- To squeeze it...</i>

65
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:28,026
<i>- Shh!
- with all your strength.</i>

66
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,763
<i>And drain every last...</i>

67
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:32,327
<i>- living, breathing...
- Could you move down a little?</i>

68
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:34,839
<i>victorious moment out of it.</i>

69
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:37,467
<i>Like when a Trojan decides...</i>

70
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:41,309
<i>...to plunge his blade into the beating
heart ofhis enemy. -</i>

71
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:45,511
<i>He realizes it's not for
his own personal glory.</i>

72
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:48,918
<i>- He does it for the better good of the
community as a whole. -</i>

73
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:54,659
<i>- We must remember that our
generation is smarter... -</i>

74
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:58,720
<i>...stronger and better equipped than those that
came before us. - Ma'am! Could you keep it down?</i>

75
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,732
<i>- And now...
- I'm dying.</i>

76
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,166
<i>it is our responsibility...</i>

77
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:06,637
to forge ahead and stake
our rightful claim at the top.

78
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,347
- You know what? This calls for a toast.
- Mm-hmm.

79
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,684
- What do you say, huh? Glasses up.
- Hear, hear. Yes.

80
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:24,347
- To Ryden.
- To Ryden.

81
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:26,984
<i>- To Ryden.
- Who I'm very proud of.</i>

82
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,927
<i>Mmm. And to Adam.</i>

83
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:33,762
The A-Man, who's here because we like him.

84
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:37,064
He's also here because
his dad was too busy to come...

85
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:41,539
and, uh, his mom couldn't
come because, um...

86
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:44,032
'cause she's dead and...

87
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,202
- Hear, hear.
- Cheers.

88
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:47,940
- Yeah.
- To your dead mother.

89
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:51,279
- Hmm. Cheers.
- Cheers.

90
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:55,284
<i>Anyway, honey, now that you're
out there looking for a job...</i>

91
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:58,586
maybe you, uh, you know,
come down and work with me.

92
00:05:58,658 --> 00:06:02,958
Uh, she's already got something lined up.

93
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,963
Tell 'em about the big interview.

94
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:08,432
At Happerman & Browning, Monday at 10:00.

95
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:10,401
- Wow!
- Hey!

96
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,961
And my thesis adviser is best friends
with the chief editor...

97
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,701
and has already put in
a good word and everything.

98
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:17,709
And they are building
these loft apartments...

99
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:20,041
like a block away from the offices, so...

100
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:22,946
They have these sweeping city views.
I could walk to work.

101
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:25,540
Didn't I tell you?

102
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:32,323
What do you see over there?

103
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,883
What do you see right here on this wall?

104
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:36,519
Uh, white paint.

105
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:38,063
- Bookshelves!
- Oh.

106
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:41,567
All my babies,
floor to ceiling, organized by title.

107
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:44,797
- No, by author. No, by genre.
- Okay. Settle down.

108
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:47,066
It's amazing. I'll take it.

109
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,402
- Really?
- Really?

110
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:51,966
Yes! I can feel it.
It's everything I ever imagined.

111
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:54,171
Hello? I love it.

112
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:57,080
Here. I've already filled
out the application.

113
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,983
<i>All right then. I'll need a check
for first and last month's rent...</i>

114
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:03,180
plus security deposit, so $3,500.

115
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,656
Done and done.

116
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:08,660
Uh... Hey, don't you think...

117
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:10,958
you're getting a little ahead
of yourself there, killer?

118
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:13,999
No. No, I don't. I will
have enough money soon.

119
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:17,263
Okay, well, right here you wrote
"Happerman & Browning" under "employer"...

120
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:19,702
but you're not actually an employee of them.

121
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:22,263
In a couple of hours,
that will be true too, so...

122
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:24,241
<i>Maybe.</i>

123
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,244
Here you go.

124
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:29,537
Thank you so much.

125
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:31,606
I'm hoping to
start moving my stuff in on Saturday.

126
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:35,176
<i>Just as soon as I call your references.
And your check clears.</i>

127
00:07:35,254 --> 00:07:37,950
<i># Wake up, wake up
wake the sun #</i>

128
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:40,788
<i># Wake up, wake up
hanging like...##</i>

129
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,760
Are we okay? Do we have enough time?

130
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:45,730
Don't worry. We got plenty of time.

131
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:48,198
Hey, what's up with Columbia?
Did you hear back yet?

132
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:51,930
Uh, big envelope, so...
I don't know. I guess I got in.

133
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:54,234
Wait. Adam.
You might've gotten into law school...

134
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:57,470
and you haven't even
opened the envelope yet?

135
00:07:57,543 --> 00:08:01,809
The shrug? Adam, you know
how I feel about the shrug.

136
00:08:02,915 --> 00:08:07,579
Another shrug? Adam. I got the double shrug?

137
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,712
<i>Hey, this is your day, okay?</i>

138
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:22,760
Shit!

139
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:25,429
- Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
- Okay. No, calm down. Calm down.

140
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:30,238
- You just calm down.
- Oh... My car! He killed my car!

141
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,770
No!

142
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:36,872
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
- No, calm down.

143
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:38,507
His insurance will pay for it.

144
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:43,114
- Uh! Look...
- It's fine. I'll take...

145
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,386
- Oh, shit.
- Shit.

146
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,601
- Yes?
- Happerman & Browning offices?

147
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:06,577
Uh, yes. Eighteenth floor.

148
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:09,114
- Okay.
- Uh, uh... Excuse me, ma'am.

149
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:11,240
You got something going on right here.

150
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:17,714
Oh!

151
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,557
- Thanks.
- Sure.

152
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:43,681
<i>Happerman & Browning. Please hold.</i>

153
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:50,454
<i>Happerman & Browning.
Yes, at 4:00. Thank you.</i>

154
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:55,290
<i>Happerman & Browning. Please hold.</i>

155
00:09:55,361 --> 00:10:00,025
Hi. I'm Ryden Malby. I have an
interview with Barbara Snaff at 10:00.

156
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:02,829
Yeah. We're actually running
about two hours behind...

157
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:06,235
so just fill this out and have a seat with
the rest of the applicants, hmm?

158
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:08,865
<i>Happerman & Browning.</i>

159
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,603
<i>Yes, at 4:00. Thank you.</i>

160
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:22,612
Sorry.

161
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:27,318
<i>Yes, Miss Snaff. Right away.</i>

162
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:31,462
Stacy Moore?

163
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:33,790
<i>Joe Schrader?</i>

164
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:34,958
<i>Caroline Hirsch.</i>

165
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:37,002
<i>Jeffrey Beales?
Kimberly Rice? Beth Brandon.</i>

166
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:38,661
<i>BarryJenkins. Gregory O'Bryant?</i>

167
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:40,968
Ryden Malby?

168
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,211
Hello.

169
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:55,981
- Please. Take a seat.
- Thank you.

170
00:10:57,857 --> 00:11:00,985
All right. You... You just graduated, yes?

171
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,789
- Yes, I...
- Major?

172
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:04,159
- English, with an emphasis...
- Minor?

173
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,164
- Communications.
- Internships?

174
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:08,359
I actually did three internships...
Penguin, Random House...

175
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:10,231
And Time Warner.

176
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:16,430
So, why do you want this job?

177
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:20,869
Because... this is not just a job to me.

178
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:25,781
This is... This is what I love.
This is what I'm good at.

179
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:29,446
When I was 11, at summer camp, all the
other kids would go down to the lake...

180
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,456
<i>and I would be finishing
Catcher in the Rye...</i>

181
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,788
'cause I couldn't get enough
of Holden Caulfield.

182
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:36,191
<i>And at 13, Bukowski's Post Office...</i>

183
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:39,629
the most explicit,
inappropriate thing I'd ever come across.

184
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,725
It was like sex ed,
except awesomely foul-mouthed.

185
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:47,136
Well, I guess what I'm getting at is
that books are all I know...

186
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:50,175
and everything I love, and...

187
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:52,437
I want this job because...

188
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:56,379
well, because I can't imagine
ever doing anything else.

189
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:03,382
All right. Good. Thank you for coming in.

190
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,233
I got it. Thank you.

191
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:20,137
- Jessica?
- Hi.

192
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:21,764
What are you doing here?

193
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:25,402
They just called me in for a little meeting.
Is that a bow? That's nice.

194
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:27,605
Jessica Bard?

195
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,012
- Barbara. Pleasure to meet you.
- You too.

196
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:34,246
Dean Brunswick just called me about you.
So glad I could fit you in.

197
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,254
Please.

198
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:38,847
I can get another job.
It won't be a problem.

199
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,448
I'm a college graduate.

200
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:42,994
Well, I didn't know you
were a college graduate.

201
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:00,636
Okay.

202
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:04,171
That Happerman & Browning thing...
It just wasn't meant to be.

203
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,582
- You know that, right?
- Yeah.

204
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,654
It's fine.

205
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:11,815
You should eat one of these.

206
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,218
No, thanks.

207
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:19,721
You're turning down an Eskimo Pie?

208
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,825
- Mmm.
- Oh, come on. All right.

209
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:27,095
Every evil, terrible thing
that ever occurs in the world...

210
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:29,971
is directly offset...
counterbalanced, if you will...

211
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:35,105
by the complete,
utter joy of biting into an Eskimo Pie.

212
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:37,877
It's... It's the way
we maintain balance in the universe.

213
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:40,213
Come on.

214
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:43,187
Mmm.

215
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:46,819
Does anyone ever say no to you?

216
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:49,292
You do all the time.

217
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:52,694
Okay. Take a bite.

218
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:55,393
Mmm. Hmm, hmm.

219
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:58,392
Mmm.

220
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,938
Mmm. Mmm.

221
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:06,334
Oh, yeah! It's like God's
just giving birth in my mouth.

222
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:10,678
Okay. That is the girl
that I fell in love with...

223
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:13,377
but harbors nothing but platonic feelings
for me, unfortunately.

224
00:14:16,388 --> 00:14:20,347
Y... Your foot is freezing. It's 90
degrees outside, and your foot is freezing.

225
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:23,623
My feet are always freezing.
I have the feet of an 80-year-old man.

226
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,994
Ooh, that's hot.

227
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:32,069
Oh, so good.

228
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:34,400
Mmm.

229
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,992
Wait, wait. Hold... Hold on.

230
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,832
<i>No.</i>

231
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,995
<i>- Yes, yes, yes.
- Shh.</i>

232
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,628
<i>No!</i>

233
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:14,670
Dad.

234
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,943
<i>Juanita. Wow.</i>

235
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:20,952
Didn't recognize you
without the cash register.

236
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:24,512
Hi, Adam.

237
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,524
What the hell are you doing here?

238
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,651
Funny.
I was about to ask you the same thing.

239
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:30,752
- It's my store.
- Come on. Let's go.

240
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:34,526
- Sorry, Mr. Davies. - Wait, wait, wait.
Actually, I'm really glad you're here.

241
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,425
'Cause you haven't
been home for a while...

242
00:15:36,426 --> 00:15:39,404
...and you definitely were
not at my graduation.

243
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:42,203
Look, I don't wanna
get into this with you right now.

244
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:45,004
- Come on. It's time to go.
- Wait. Juanita, is he paying...

245
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:48,205
I hope he's paying you overtime for this,
'cause you do have rights.

246
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,214
<i>You should call your union.</i>

247
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:07,091
Well, welcome back home.

248
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,027
<i>Bet you're excited.</i>

249
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:21,774
Well, let's have a little look-see here.

250
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:26,349
- There she is! Hi!
- Hey, Mom.

251
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:29,080
She's home!

252
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:31,588
Oh, look at that. That's just a crime. Oh!

253
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:34,023
- Welcome back, baby.
- Oh, thanks, Mom.

254
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:36,391
<i>Oh, I'm so glad you're home.</i>

255
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:40,694
<i>- Uh, Dad, that's gotta get into the shop.
- Huh?</i>

256
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:42,791
Uh, I'm not so sure.

257
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:48,998
- What are you doing? - I'm just
looking it over. Gonna be all right.

258
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:52,100
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

259
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,202
You... You're not thinking
about fixing this yourself, are you?

260
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:56,338
Yeah. Just have some faith
in my abilities, honey.

261
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:59,111
- Usually there's a spot, if I can
just hear it. - But... Dad!

262
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,550
- You've never fixed a car before.
- Honey.

263
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,418
At one point, I'd never roundhouse-kicked
a man in the neck before either.

264
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:07,118
Now I do it every Wednesday.
My mind's like a sea sponge, honey.

265
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:09,854
When the synapses get going in Walter
Malby's mind... boom, boom, boom...

266
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:12,328
It's gonna be fun.
Don't worry about the car. I got it.

267
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:13,592
I got the car covered.

268
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,631
<i>Let me give you a hand there, Adam.
That-a-boy.</i>

269
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:20,103
Good. Look at you. You're a self-starter.

270
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:22,037
Walter! Walter! Walter! Walter!

271
00:17:22,107 --> 00:17:24,541
- Watch your step there. You should
wear work gloves. - There's a derby!

272
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:27,704
There's a boxcar derby!
Can we make a boxcar?

273
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:31,739
- Not now. Not now.
- Pretty please? The derby's next month!

274
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:34,251
<i>- Can we make a boxcar?
- Oh, geez.</i>

275
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:39,123
Son of a bitch.
Look at that.

276
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:43,491
<i>I knew it. Son of a bitch.
Third time. Third G.D. time!</i>

277
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,496
Goddamn it. That's it.

278
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:48,328
- Wait. Where are you going?
- Look at this. I gotta...

279
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,561
<i>- Walter, no. Don't. Honey?
- Dad, come back.</i>

280
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:53,662
What? Goddamn.

281
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:56,731
<i>- We could go home and clean it. - No.
I gotta talk to him. I'll talk to this guy.</i>

282
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:58,504
You don't need to disturb him. I mean...

283
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,408
He's not home.

284
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:03,846
I know he's not working. I don't think
he has a job. Goddamn it. Where is he?

285
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:11,846
Hi.

286
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:15,524
Hi.

287
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:18,688
Um...

288
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:21,496
Hey. Hey. Hey.

289
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:25,298
Your cat has now crapped on my doorstep,
in my yard...

290
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:28,032
and now on my driveway, which around here...

291
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,041
is like church to me.

292
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,543
- Okay? That's sanctuary.
- Well...

293
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,545
I'm really sorry, sir. I am...

294
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:39,983
I'll talk to him. Yeah. I'll talk to him.

295
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:43,547
- See you later.
- Okay.

296
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:53,057
<i>Today you are getting a job.</i>

297
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:57,466

00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:28,031
The bottom line is, what I lack in
experience, I make up for in vision.

308
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,658
And what I don't know...

309
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:32,397
I make up for with passion.

310
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:37,541
<i># My world, it's on fire now #</i>

311
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:40,669
<i># My world is turned upside down #</i>

312
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:43,306
<i># And I don't know what to do #</i>

313
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:45,077
<i># Without you #</i>

314
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,345
<i>I'm driven. Full of ideas.</i>

315
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:49,080
I'm upbeat.

316
00:19:49,154 --> 00:19:51,520
Most importantly, I am
incredibly enthusiastic...

317
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,217
About the work your company is doing.

318
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:55,692
Really? Like what?

319
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:03,464
<i>#Don't give me a hard time ##</i>

320
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:06,265
<i>Hunter, I hate getting these calls.</i>

321
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:09,102
What did I tell you about
licking the kids' heads?

322
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:11,108
- Don't do it.
- That's right. Ever.

323
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:14,077
- Okay?
- Fine.

324
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:15,707
I mean, I know you
like the way it tastes,

325
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:16,708
but some kids don't like
having their heads licked.

326
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:22,083
Hey!

327
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:24,088
How'd it go?

328
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:26,420
I asked the V.P. if she was pregnant.

329
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:30,552
- No. She was just fat.
- Oh. Well, that's hard sometimes.

330
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:33,072
I'm gonna call my friend
Betty from high school.

331
00:20:33,073 --> 00:20:34,547
She owns an indie publishing company.

332
00:20:34,548 --> 00:20:36,432
I'm gonna ask her for a favor.
I'm just gonna do it.

333
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:38,935
Dad already called her.
Betty's dead.

334
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:41,404
- Really?
- She died.

335
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:44,772
<i>That's a shame.</i>

336
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:47,175
What is it?

337
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:50,010
- Oh, my God.
- What?

338
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:58,687
What do you guys think? This one?

339
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:04,117
Or that little mahogany
number I was in earlier?

340
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:13,003
Hey, Hunter, come here.

341
00:21:13,071 --> 00:21:17,474
What do you think of Grandma spending
her eternal slumber in this one, huh?

342
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:22,002
I love it!

343
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,844
- Let's talk about casket ornamentation.
- Ornamentation?

344
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:28,852
Yes. Casket ornamentation adds a personal
touch many families find comforting.

345
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:32,686
And we offer a variety of custom corners
and commemorative panels...

346
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:36,956
to highlight a loved one's passions.

347
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:39,759
Whatever you want, you could put it
right there on your commemorative panel.

348
00:21:39,831 --> 00:21:42,322
It'll be right with you
through the afterlife.

349
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:45,393
I'm just not sure about all this.
Thank you.

350
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:49,133
Really? What do I have to do to put you in
one of my coffins today?

351
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:54,978
How about a little
magnesium seepage protection system?

352
00:21:57,716 --> 00:22:00,082
Whoa.

353
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,143
That's $18,000.

354
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,269
That's the exact same...

355
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:06,847
...corrosion and rust technology
that protects our Alaskan pipeline.

356
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:11,019
- That's what that is.
- That's $18,000.

357
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:14,757
You know, she's absolutely right.

358
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,767
I mean, why spend all that money...

359
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:19,895
when there's probably
a nice local ditch somewhere...

360
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:22,838
you could take me to
and dump me in for free?

361
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:25,672
Oh, Maureen, we'd never do that.

362
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:51,799
No, no, no, no! No!

363
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:19,453
Ooh.

364
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,074
<i>Special delivery.</i>

365
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:41,142
I got a cell phone, credit card...

366
00:23:41,219 --> 00:23:44,711
student loan and, last but not least...

367
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:51,291
one more little item...

368
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:53,422
I thought you might wanna see.

369
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:57,633
- Look at that.
- Mmm.

370
00:23:57,702 --> 00:23:59,169
Come on!

371
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:02,706
Thanks.

372
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:08,337
Hey.

373
00:24:08,413 --> 00:24:12,975
Got an idea. Since it concerns your future,
I need you to pay attention.

374
00:24:13,051 --> 00:24:15,417
- You listening?
- No. Dad...

375
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:18,251
Listen to me. Listen to me. Ready?

376
00:24:20,926 --> 00:24:22,860
Buckles.

377
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:25,521
Buckles.

378
00:24:25,597 --> 00:24:27,656
Yeah. Belt buckles.

379
00:24:27,732 --> 00:24:31,828
Million-dollar niche business.
They're going crazy on the Internet.

380
00:24:31,903 --> 00:24:36,533
Who do you think met a distributor,
is gonna start his own company?

381
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:40,669
But, Dad, what about The Luggage Shack?
They just made you regional manager.

382
00:24:40,745 --> 00:24:43,737
You gotta think big picture here.
You gotta have vision.

383
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:45,840
You know what I'm saying?
You just gotta see the...

384
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:49,785
And since none of this other crap
is really working out for you...

385
00:24:50,956 --> 00:24:54,915
More than likely... gonna
need a vice president.

386
00:24:59,064 --> 00:25:00,156
V.P.

387
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:06,864
<i>- You go out there and
drum up some business. -</i>

388
00:25:06,938 --> 00:25:10,101
<i>Come on. Let's go out there and put
some buckles on belts. What do you say?</i>

389
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:19,910
Are you ever gonna actually open that?

390
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:24,388
It's made a long journey from New York.
I'm letting it breathe.

391
00:25:35,133 --> 00:25:38,967
- You know, Adam, if you don't wanna go...
- Don't give me that shit.

392
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:44,775
It's not like I'm gonna force you.

393
00:25:44,843 --> 00:25:46,777
No, you're just gonna hate me if I don't.

394
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:49,279
No, I'm not gonna hate you.

395
00:26:03,628 --> 00:26:05,619
I just want more for you.

396
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:13,327
Do you wanna be like me? You wanna
come home from work 11:00 at night?

397
00:26:14,973 --> 00:26:18,238
Save your whole life so you can afford
the mortgage on a place like this?

398
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,711
I'm going to bed.

399
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:50,007
<i>- Seriously, yeah.
- It's a very funny thing, you know.</i>

400
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:53,073
People keep calling me, but
I'm like, " Thanks, but...

401
00:26:53,074 --> 00:26:54,845
...I'm working
for Happerman & Browning.

402
00:26:54,846 --> 00:26:57,508
Make me a better offer, we'll talk."

403
00:26:57,582 --> 00:27:00,016
- So what are you guys doin'?
- Me?

404
00:27:00,085 --> 00:27:02,349
- Why, sure.
- Charles Schwab, baby!

405
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:05,287
- I'm moving to San Jose... dot-com.
- Oh, nice, man.

406
00:27:05,357 --> 00:27:07,518
- You're going to...
- Pharmacy school, next month.

407
00:27:07,592 --> 00:27:11,153
- Yeah, so what are you doing? What's
your deal? - I got into Columbia. We'll see.

408
00:27:11,229 --> 00:27:15,393
<i>Do it. Stay out of the workforce
as long as you can.</i>

409
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:19,028
Ryden, what about you? What are you up to?

410
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:21,698
Uh... I just...

411
00:27:22,707 --> 00:27:25,870
You know, I've been interviewing.

412
00:27:25,944 --> 00:27:30,904
A lot. And, um, just had some
really amazing opportunities...

413
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:34,042
and just keeping my options open.

414
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:36,519
So what you're saying is you're unemployed.

415
00:27:38,256 --> 00:27:40,588
<i>God. I feel like such a loser.</i>

416
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,923
Everyone is doing something
with their lives...

417
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:46,020
and I just turn out to be
this big, pathetic loser.

418
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:49,766
Come on.

419
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:51,699
No. I don't want your pity hug.

420
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:54,102
Come on. Ryden.

421
00:27:58,043 --> 00:28:02,844
It's okay, you poor,
poor, no-talent screw-up.

422
00:28:02,914 --> 00:28:04,882
Oh, shut up! You can joke about it.

423
00:28:04,949 --> 00:28:06,883
You already got into law school.

424
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:09,943
- So?
- So, you're set. You're good. Whatever.

425
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:13,582
Yeah, maybe I'm set and I'm good,
but does that mean I'm gonna be happy?

426
00:28:17,128 --> 00:28:19,892
- Come here.
- Screw you. I'm not going in.

427
00:28:20,965 --> 00:28:22,728
You don't have to go in. Just...

428
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:24,632
come out here so I can tell you something.

429
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:28,571
- I don't think two people can be on
this thing. - Quit bitching and come here.

430
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:35,143
Okay.

431
00:28:37,182 --> 00:28:39,309
- Come all the way to the edge.
- What?

432
00:28:40,485 --> 00:28:42,646
I'm celebrating.

433
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,985
I'm opening at The Mint on Friday.

434
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:47,024
- You are?
- Yeah.

435
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:48,957
- Shut up! Really?
- Yeah.

436
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:52,622
Adam, so you're going into music then.
Why don't you just say that?

437
00:28:52,697 --> 00:28:55,222
Well, because I'm not
saying that necessarily.

438
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,995
So you're going to law school?

439
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:59,093
No, I'm not saying that either necessarily.

440
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:02,298
- Then what are you saying, necessarily?
- I don't know what I'm saying.

441
00:29:02,373 --> 00:29:06,434
All I'm saying is that I'm opening
at The Mint on Friday. Yea!

442
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:13,145
Look, you got the hard part figured out.
You know what you wanna do.

443
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:16,085
Now you can just spend
the rest of your life going after it.

444
00:29:17,889 --> 00:29:20,414
This one's popular with all the
college kids. And this one...

445
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:23,290
- No, no.
- If you like 'em, you sell 'em all...

446
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:25,192
- I got plenty more... even higher quality.
- That's fantastic.

447
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:29,359
- Almost unbelievable.
- I am Hugo, the vampire.

448
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:33,029
- Not now, Hugo.
- Then help me build my boxcar.

449
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:35,572
I'm doing business now. Doing business.

450
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,438
<i>It's so lifelike. It is. That's real snake.</i>

451
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,842
<i>- All made right here in the country?
- All here.</i>

452
00:29:40,912 --> 00:29:42,474
Geez, that's fantastic.
I'll call you about the rest of them.

453
00:29:42,475 --> 00:29:45,802
All right, buddy.
Thank you. All right.

454
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,719
Hey, who was that guy?

455
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:50,948
Here, honey.
Grab that box for me, would you?

456
00:29:51,022 --> 00:29:53,855
Carry it inside.
That's Gary. Gary the Buckle Man.

457
00:29:54,859 --> 00:29:57,259
So these are the buckles, huh?

458
00:29:57,328 --> 00:29:59,262
Yep, first shipment.

459
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:01,821
Hey. Question.

460
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,834
As vice president...

461
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:07,838
how would you like to spearhead
the marketing campaign?

462
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:12,570
- The marketing campaign?
- Yeah. You know, ads and slogans and...

463
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:16,136
you know, maybe some clever ideas
for some of the buckles, like...

464
00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:18,239
I don't know. What do we got here?

465
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:22,753
Look at this. Look at that one there. That
could be the... like, the Cobra, you know?

466
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,755
Or, uh... I don't know. Here.

467
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,688
Look... Here. This could be the...

468
00:30:26,758 --> 00:30:28,157
Uh...

469
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:30,251
It's just the flag of
Delaware. I don't know.

470
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:35,061
But you know what I mean.
Just some thoughts. Just ideas.

471
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:40,096
You know what I want...
as vice president, Dad?

472
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:42,105
I want my car back.

473
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:45,734
I want to stop having to call a taxi
every time I have to leave the house.

474
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:49,007
I told you. The part hasn't come in from
the factory yet. It's... It's a curveball.

475
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,605
You're gonna get thrown curveballs.
Life and work are like baseball.

476
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:54,117
You can't rest at the plate.
You gotta keep trying.

477
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:58,349
But I am trying hard.
I mean, I... I am scouring the job market.

478
00:30:58,423 --> 00:31:02,792
I... I am. I'm getting up early,
and I'm searching for something, anything...

479
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:04,795
to get my foot in the door.

480
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:07,388
And do you have any clue
what these interviews are like?

481
00:31:07,465 --> 00:31:10,298
I mean, I'm constantly having to gauge
how I'm coming across...

482
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:12,666
all the while without a consistent form
of transportation...

483
00:31:12,737 --> 00:31:15,968
because you turned my car
into your latest science project.

484
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:19,703
So I really don't need to hear
that I'm not trying right now.

485
00:31:19,777 --> 00:31:23,770
Well, maybe you're setting
your sights too high.

486
00:31:23,848 --> 00:31:27,716
Oh, really? Well, where do you think
I should be setting my sights?

487
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:35,716
If you just give this one a chance,
I know you're gonna love it.

488
00:31:35,793 --> 00:31:38,785
You just have to open it up,
get in there, check out all the pockets.

489
00:31:38,863 --> 00:31:41,661
Ma'am? Sir?

490
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,928
It's on clearance!

491
00:31:48,339 --> 00:31:50,807
Eye contact. Remember? We talked about it.

492
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:52,809
You gotta bring 'em in. Okay?

493
00:31:52,877 --> 00:31:55,311
<i>Honey, come on.</i>

494
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,974
You gotta have a positive attitude
if you want to sell the suitcases.

495
00:31:58,049 --> 00:32:01,246
Here. Let me show you something.
Hey, how you doing?

496
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:05,484
- Fine. - You headed out of town,
if you don't mind me asking?

497
00:32:05,556 --> 00:32:08,525
- Yeah.
- Really? Where you going?

498
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:11,084
- Maui.
- Oh, wow! Hawaii. That's fantastic.

499
00:32:11,162 --> 00:32:13,096
You going there for business, pleasure?

500
00:32:13,164 --> 00:32:15,257
- Business.
- No, don't say business.

501
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:16,925
- Don't say business. Say pleasure.
Who go... - Pleasure.

502
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:19,333
- Why do you ask me the question then?
- I'm try... Here. Look.

503
00:32:19,404 --> 00:32:22,862
Let me show you, honey. Do a little
demonstration, you know, right in here.

504
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:25,205
Like this. You point at the
wheels or something, you know.

505
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:27,938
<i>- It's like, you know what? Those
girls from Deal or No Deal. - Mm-hmm.</i>

506
00:32:28,012 --> 00:32:32,039
You do that. Maybe not so slutty,
but show with a hand thing.

507
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:33,640
Here. Go ahead.

508
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:35,652
Remember... eye contact.

509
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,086
- Okay. Look at the wheels.
- There you go.

510
00:32:38,156 --> 00:32:40,716
- Look how they roll. Oh, it's so nice.
- Yeah.

511
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:43,386
Here we go. Hot potato.
Right here. Right here.

512
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:46,362
Are you in the market for some lug...
Oh, crap!

513
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:48,058
- Hi.
- Hi.

514
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:51,295
- I didn't know you worked here at
The Luggage Shack. - I don't work here.

515
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:53,303
Uh...

516
00:32:53,371 --> 00:32:56,636
I, um... It's... It's temporary.

517
00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:58,505
Right.

518
00:32:59,577 --> 00:33:03,377
Um, how's Happerman & Browning?

519
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:05,678
Uh, great. Really, really great.

520
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:07,650
They're sending me to New York
next week for a conference.

521
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:09,744
- Hence the need for a new briefcase.
- Sounds so great.

522
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,982
Yeah, I saw one over here
last week that I loved.

523
00:33:12,056 --> 00:33:14,251
- Let me take a look at that black one.
- Up there?

524
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:16,555
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah. Um...

525
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,962
There we go.

526
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:26,527
Ah... You know what? I want to take a look
at the one right next to it.

527
00:33:26,604 --> 00:33:28,765
<i>Nope. I gotta trust my
instincts on this one.</i>

528
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,741
I'm saying no to that one.
I'm going back to the original.

529
00:33:37,982 --> 00:33:41,042
You know, things are moving
outlandishly quick for me right now.

530
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:43,053
Unbelievably fast.

531
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:45,715
I'll need a good team.
I need people around me I can trust.

532
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:47,781
This is a no.

533
00:33:50,628 --> 00:33:52,687
Let me take a look at this gray one here.

534
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:54,629
I thought you wanted a briefcase.

535
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:57,065
<i>- I'm gonna need both.
- Mm-hmm.</i>

536
00:33:57,135 --> 00:33:59,365
- Lot of traveling.
- Right.

537
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,563
Okay.

538
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,369
That's the one.

539
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:09,313
You know, Ryden, I think
we've got really good synergy, you and I.

540
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,314
I know you're in a tough place right now...

541
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:15,216
but I want you to remember that
struggle and strife come before success.

542
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:19,356
Even in the dictionary.

543
00:34:19,424 --> 00:34:22,222
I'm not gonna take this one.
Can I see that black one up there?

544
00:34:23,828 --> 00:34:25,819
You know what?

545
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,333
Dad! All yours!

546
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:40,074
Hunty, can't ride Mama's shoe
when she's trying to make waffles.

547
00:34:40,144 --> 00:34:42,078
- Giddyap.
- Come on, honey.

548
00:34:42,146 --> 00:34:44,137
<i>Go play. Go.</i>

549
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:48,083
- Ride like the wind.
- Honey.

550
00:34:48,152 --> 00:34:49,744
What do you want, Maureen? What?

551
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:53,348
<i>- Hunter is a very unique little boy.
- I don't want you to coddle him.</i>

552
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:58,327
I am not coddling him, okay?
I'm just a little concerned...

553
00:35:00,164 --> 00:35:02,098
that he's weird.

554
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:05,260
Well, of course he's weird!

555
00:35:05,336 --> 00:35:08,965
He's a Malby. Weird is good.

556
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,770
Weird indicates a creative force.

557
00:35:11,843 --> 00:35:14,311
<i>You have no idea what
I go through, okay? Trust me.</i>

558
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:17,438
- Hey, come on. I wanna show you
something. Come on. - Huh?

559
00:35:20,051 --> 00:35:21,985
# Bum, bum, bum, bum #

560
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:25,648
# Bum, bum, bum, bum
bum, bum, bum, bum #

561
00:35:25,723 --> 00:35:28,453
It is time.

562
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:34,959
# Bum, bum, bum, bum #

563
00:35:35,032 --> 00:35:37,159

00:35:37,235 --> 00:35:41,296
# Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum #

565
00:35:41,372 --> 00:35:43,272
<i>#Bum #</i>

566
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:44,535
<i>#Bum #</i>

567
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:46,975

570
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,086
No way.

571
00:35:57,388 --> 00:35:59,879
- It's really fixed?
- Yeah.

572
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:04,420
Yeah, man.
Your dad doesn't jerk around.

573
00:36:05,963 --> 00:36:08,193
Ooh.

574
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:12,600
Watch this. Crack this hood.
Take a look at this.

575
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:19,070
- Now I'm gonna go fire her up.
- Okay.

576
00:36:19,143 --> 00:36:21,077
Look under the engine
and let me know what happens.

577
00:36:21,145 --> 00:36:23,670
I wasn't happy with the timing,
so I tweaked it a little bit.

578
00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:25,943
Think I got her where I like her.

579
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,507
<i>- Ready?
- Yeah.</i>

580
00:36:30,788 --> 00:36:33,848
<i>Ah, it's great! Hey!</i>

581
00:36:37,662 --> 00:36:39,562
<i>Just a little bit more. It's...</i>

582
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:40,688
<i>Whoa!</i>

583
00:36:45,836 --> 00:36:46,803
Oh!

584
00:36:53,644 --> 00:36:56,135
It just isn't fair.

585
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:59,513
There you are, this poor, little,
innocent thing that wouldn't hurt a fly...

586
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:03,315
and then one day
you're murdered by my own son.

587
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:06,481
It was an accident. Geez.

588
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:08,718
Why didn't you tell me to look behind me?

589
00:37:08,793 --> 00:37:10,385
What? How is this my fault?

590
00:37:10,461 --> 00:37:14,397
Hon, you always have to keep your eyes open.
Scanning. Constantly scanning.

591
00:37:14,465 --> 00:37:16,933
- You told me to look at the engine.
- Can't do two things at once?

592
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:19,162
This is ridiculous.
You... You hated that cat.

593
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:22,695
- Shh. Keep your voice down. - You did say
something about wanting to flatten the cat.

594
00:37:22,773 --> 00:37:24,638
<i>Okay, okay. All right. Fine.</i>

595
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:28,406
- It was a goddamn accident. - Either
way, somebody has to tell the neighbor.

596
00:37:35,686 --> 00:37:38,211
All right. Geez. I can't believe...

597
00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:40,257
<i>Look out. Look out. Oh, God.</i>

598
00:37:40,324 --> 00:37:44,192
God... Jesus.
Goddamn. Even in death! Jesus!

599
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:48,426
- Ryden, go with him.
- What? No!

600
00:37:48,499 --> 00:37:50,433
Come on, honey. Look at him.

601
00:37:51,802 --> 00:37:54,100
Mmm, all right.

602
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:59,201
- Oh, no, honey, don't do that.
- Oh, Hunter, don't do that. No, no.

603
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:03,435
Dad!

604
00:38:03,514 --> 00:38:06,847
- What?
- Why would you do that?

605
00:38:06,917 --> 00:38:10,284
- Do what?
- That knock.

606
00:38:10,354 --> 00:38:13,687
- What?
- Of all the knocks, that one?

607
00:38:13,758 --> 00:38:17,785
That one is the one you think best says,
"Sorry we killed your cat"?

608
00:38:17,862 --> 00:38:19,853
"Of all the knocks"?

609
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:23,127
What do you mean, "Of all the knocks"?
How many knocks do you think there are?

610
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:27,297
No, seriously.
How many knocks do you think there are?

611
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:31,271
- Let's just make this brief, okay?
- All right.

612
00:38:33,544 --> 00:38:35,671
Cat's dead.

613
00:38:35,746 --> 00:38:39,204
Ran over him on accident.

614
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:43,553
We're really sorry. Um...

615
00:38:43,621 --> 00:38:46,818
<i>- We didn't mean for it to happen.
- Where is he?</i>

Okay? Okeydokey.

641
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:21,141
Hey.

642
00:40:21,218 --> 00:40:24,187
Listen, I'm really sorry about all this.

643
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:28,282
I... Well, I can't tell
you how sorry I am, I mean...

00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:30,623
about your poor cat and this...

645
00:40:30,694 --> 00:40:32,491
Do you want some breakfast?

646
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:36,866
- What, right now?
- Yeah.

647
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:38,868
It's almost dinnertime.

648
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:41,837
Best time for pancakes.
Do you like pancakes?

649
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:45,873
- One more?
- No, I'm good, thanks. I'm full.

650
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:49,435
- Do you not like my pancakes?
- I love your pancakes, but I'm stuffed.

651
00:40:49,513 --> 00:40:51,003
- All right.
- All right.

652
00:40:51,081 --> 00:40:52,810
All right.

653
00:40:52,883 --> 00:40:55,374
No, no, no, no. You go sit.

654
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,114
- Don't worry. I'll take care of it.
- Okay.

655
00:40:57,188 --> 00:40:58,780
- Yeah, yeah.
- Thanks.

656
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:05,391
You know, it's weird. I've never
seen the inside of this house before.

657
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:08,193
Yeah. Kind of unimpressive, isn't it?

658
00:41:08,265 --> 00:41:11,564
No, it looks exactly like ours, actually.

659
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:15,366
<i>- Except you have cooler stuff.
- Yeah, yeah. I direct infomercials.</i>

Like this. What is this?

662
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:23,371
- This?
- Yeah.

663
00:41:23,447 --> 00:41:26,075
Well, a couch.

664
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,550
- That's a couch?
- Yeah.

665
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:43,823
<i>Uno, dos, tres, cuatro...</i>

00:41:46,604 --> 00:41:48,367
Ah.

668
00:41:48,439 --> 00:41:51,931
Super light.

669
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:56,002
And can even be used
as a flotation device in case of a flood.

670
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:00,950
<i>Let's see. I, um... I have no car...</i>

671
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:03,953
I, uh, lost my job peddling luggage...

672
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:07,354
- and I now live with my parents.
- All right. Living the dream.

673
00:42:07,424 --> 00:42:08,914
- Yeah.
- That's great.

674
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:15,965
Yeah, this whole postgraduation thing...

675
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:19,469
is not exactly turning
out the way I planned.

676
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:22,700
I just thought I'd be doing
something amazing by now.

677
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:27,472
Or at least doing something.

678
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:29,479
Right. Hmm.

679
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:34,249
Well, listen.

680
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:40,547
I know it doesn't solve the problem,
but if you need something temporary...

681
00:42:40,624 --> 00:42:43,149
we could always use an extra P.A. on set.

682
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:47,288
You know, the hours are crap,
and the money is very, very bad, but...

683
00:42:47,364 --> 00:42:49,889
it will get you out of the house.

684
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:54,970
Yeah. Yeah, that would be good.

685
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:57,303
- You got a job.
- Thanks.

686
00:42:57,374 --> 00:42:59,171
Cool.

687
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:01,177
But now...

688
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:04,180
I think it's time for you...

689
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:07,183
to start thinking about the good things.

690
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:09,310
Yeah.

691
00:43:10,955 --> 00:43:13,287
- Like what?
- Like...

692
00:43:15,492 --> 00:43:17,426
your ears.

693
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:20,855
- Ears?
- Yeah.

694
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:23,331
- My ears?
- Yeah, you've got incredible ears.

695
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,334
Incredible?

696
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:28,564
Yeah.

697
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:31,199
You know how some people
have that... that droop...

698
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:34,711
that sort of tragic dangling earlobe thing?

699
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:37,679
Yours... not so, no.

700
00:43:37,748 --> 00:43:39,739
Not a single...

701
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:50,153
Just don't know why
you had to give him those cookies.

702
00:43:50,227 --> 00:43:52,627
- We'll buy more cookies.
- You know they're my favorites.

703
00:44:02,706 --> 00:44:05,300
Hey.

704
00:44:05,376 --> 00:44:07,970
- Where's Ryden?
- She's paying her condolences.

705
00:44:16,954 --> 00:44:19,514
Fuck me!

706
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:22,150
Well, I would, but somebody beat me to it.

707
00:44:27,798 --> 00:44:30,028
Cool.

708
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:49,449
Listen. Dad, I know
that was a little bit awkward, but I...

709
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,114
I just hope you used one.

710
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:55,454
- One what?
- Used something... That you used something.

711
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:56,618
Something.

712
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:58,958
Used a... You know what I'm...

713
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:01,020
Used a rubber or something like that.

714
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:03,192
- But...
- Protection!

715
00:45:03,267 --> 00:45:08,204
Oh, uh... But we didn't, uh...

716
00:45:08,272 --> 00:45:11,002
'Cause I'm gonna tell you something.
Herpes isn't a picnic.

717
00:45:11,075 --> 00:45:14,306
It's not a river-rafting trip either, like
they want you to think on that commercial.

718
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:16,369
- River rafting? - Everybody's
having fun with their herpes out there.

719
00:45:16,447 --> 00:45:18,039
- What?
- You know what?

720
00:45:18,115 --> 00:45:21,380
"lx-nay" on the "oodle-day." That's it.

721
00:45:21,452 --> 00:45:24,421
- "Oodle-day"? - You know what I
mean. I don't want you near that...

722
00:45:24,488 --> 00:45:27,821
Don't... Just stay away from the whole...

723
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:32,595
- pen... penile area.
- Dad.

724
00:45:32,663 --> 00:45:34,995
Don't even see him anymore.
Don't even see him anymore.

725
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:37,590
- That's it. You can't see him anymore.
- Or what?

726
00:45:37,668 --> 00:45:40,262
What are you gonna do, ground me?
I'm 22 years old.

727
00:45:40,337 --> 00:45:42,931
Oh, really? Well, you're
forgetting you live in my house.

728
00:45:43,006 --> 00:45:46,737
Well, trust me.
I'm doing everything I can to change that.

729
00:45:57,321 --> 00:45:59,289
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

730
00:45:59,356 --> 00:46:02,154
My name's Bill. And I'm a little upset...

731
00:46:02,226 --> 00:46:04,592
to say the least, if you know what I mean.

732
00:46:05,996 --> 00:46:07,930
Okay.

733
00:46:07,998 --> 00:46:11,490
Someone stole two boxes
of my Buckle-O-Bill belt buckles.

734
00:46:11,568 --> 00:46:13,729
World renowned, uniquely crafted.

735
00:46:13,804 --> 00:46:15,772
Word on the street is
you're trying to sell 'em.

736
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:19,138
You talking about this? This here?

737
00:46:19,209 --> 00:46:22,508
No, no, no. I bought this
legit from Gary the Buckle Man.

738
00:46:22,579 --> 00:46:24,513
I don't know Gary the Buckle Man!

739
00:46:24,581 --> 00:46:26,981
I know you're trying to take
food out of my kid's mouth.

740
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:30,019
I don't even have a kid.
But if I did, you're taking his food!

741
00:46:30,087 --> 00:46:32,282
- Uh-uh.
- I want my buckle!

742
00:46:32,356 --> 00:46:34,290
- Hey!
- Hey! Hey!

743
00:46:34,358 --> 00:46:36,451
I need at least three feet
of personal space here.

744
00:46:36,527 --> 00:46:39,018
- It's my buckle!
- I'm gonna paralyze you!

745
00:46:41,231 --> 00:46:43,199
Crazy, man.

746
00:46:43,267 --> 00:46:45,292
It's my Delaware!

747
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:48,236
Two fingers. Two. That's all it takes.

748
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:50,239
<i>I will call the cops, man!</i>

Wait. So, you're gonna be a P.A. now?

754
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:12,055
It's just temporary. Our
neighbor hooked it up.

755
00:47:12,129 --> 00:47:14,723
Wait. Rico Suave from across the street?

756
00:47:14,798 --> 00:47:17,858
That... That old dude
who wears the low-rise jeans?

757
00:47:17,935 --> 00:47:21,393
What? He's 34. He's not that old.

758
00:47:21,471 --> 00:47:23,405
Very specific information you have there.

759
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:28,166
Hey.

760
00:47:31,315 --> 00:47:34,512
So, uh, tomorrow night?

761
00:47:34,585 --> 00:47:36,917

00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:44,221
<i>- Okay.
- Okay.</i>

765
00:47:44,294 --> 00:47:49,129
# Ryden is beautiful
It's true #

766
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:53,602
<i>#'Cause she's got eyes ofblue #</i>

767
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:58,767
# But then one day I tried to kiss you #

768
00:47:58,842 --> 00:48:03,711
#And you said
Oh, n-n-no #

769
00:48:07,951 --> 00:48:10,476
<i>- You're an idiot.
- You love me.</i>

770
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:12,488
Anyway, so here's the deal.

771
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:16,686
<i>Tomorrow night, me, you...</i>

772
00:48:18,428 --> 00:48:19,759
that dress.

773
00:48:24,134 --> 00:48:25,624
Zip me.

774
00:48:25,702 --> 00:48:28,170
Uh, yeah. Um...

775
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:32,140
So, first of all, I'm just gonna rock
the socks off everyone at that show.

776
00:48:32,209 --> 00:48:35,906
Second, you're gonna throw your bra onstage,
just scream like a little girl.

777
00:48:35,979 --> 00:48:38,641
Um... There.

778
00:48:42,552 --> 00:48:46,682
And third,
we're gonna go out to a big, fancy dinner.

779
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:48,850
- Multiple forks... everything.
- We are?

780
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:50,291
- Yeah.
- Why?

781
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:55,660
To, uh, celebrate your new quasi job thing.

782
00:48:55,732 --> 00:48:58,223
- Just to celebrate?
- Yeah.

783
00:48:58,302 --> 00:49:00,532
- That sounds fun.
- Uh, it sounds...

784
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:03,300
"fan-crapping-tastic,"
is what it sounds like.

785
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:06,168
<i>Making guacamole for your family...</i>

786
00:49:06,243 --> 00:49:08,473
<i>orjust for yourself used to be a fight.</i>

787
00:49:08,545 --> 00:49:13,380
But now, with the Guacanator...
the Guacanator 3000...

788
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:17,887
<i>making guacamole is as
easy as uno, dos, tres!</i>

789
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:25,391
Senor Avocado... he no stand a chance
against the grips of the Guacanator.

790
00:49:29,266 --> 00:49:31,530
The only assault will be
against your taste buds!

791
00:49:31,601 --> 00:49:33,899
<i>Got it. Got it. Okay, cut!</i>

792
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:36,565
<i>Okay, I got it. All right.</i>

793
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:39,734
<i>- And we're clear. - This mustache
is crap. The hairs are going in my mouth.</i>

794
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:41,801
- I can swear I swallowed a couple.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

795
00:49:41,878 --> 00:49:43,812
We'll take care of that in a sec, all right?

796
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:46,474
<i>- Thanks.
- Okay, everyone, take five.</i>

797
00:49:47,551 --> 00:49:49,644
<i>- Take a fiver.
- There she is.</i>

798
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:53,747
- Hey. - How's the first day
going? As shitty as I promised?

799
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:57,089
- It's not so bad.
- Well, just wait.

800
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:00,254
Ah. Psst. Bro. Hey, bro! Yo, dude.

801
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:02,821
Can I talk to you for a second before
you shoot anything else?

802
00:50:02,899 --> 00:50:04,833
Well, this should be fun.

803
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:09,404
<i>The script is like a
road map, but the road map...</i>

804
00:50:09,473 --> 00:50:12,567
Can you talk to the catering people? The
meat on this sandwich smells like ass-crack.

805
00:50:12,642 --> 00:50:14,269
- Oh, okay.
- First of all, you're really close.

806
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:17,973
So, congrats. Bones. Awesome. Sweet.

807
00:50:18,048 --> 00:50:20,414
We're getting so close,
but I just wanna go from the top.

808
00:50:20,484 --> 00:50:23,078
A couple things to make this double awesome.

809
00:50:23,153 --> 00:50:26,589
Give me more Mexican. I gotta get
more Mexican. You know what I mean?

810
00:50:26,656 --> 00:50:29,784
I gotta... Oh! I wanna be
on or across the border.

811
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:34,126
You know what I mean? "Mexi-can." Not
"Mexi-can't" or "Mexi-could." "Mexi-can."

812
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:37,462
Like any of that flavor,
literally and figuratively, into it.

813
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:38,796
- Awesome.
- All right.

814
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:41,804
Second of all, your shots are boring, bro.

815
00:50:42,939 --> 00:50:45,373
Seriously. Here's an idea.

816
00:50:45,442 --> 00:50:47,967
<i>Did you ever see The Matrix?
Movie about, like, alternative reality.</i>

817
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:51,481
<i>Okay, that shot... Keanu's, like, up in
the air... Bam! He's in the air. Freeze.</i>

818
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:53,812
360-degree shot... Bam, bam, bam, bam.

819
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:57,115
Remember what I'm saying? Yeah, like that.
That's exciting. That's awesome.

820
00:50:57,187 --> 00:50:59,587
But check this out. Instead of Keanu...

821
00:50:59,656 --> 00:51:03,217
it's the Guacanator is up in the air,
and you shoot around it, like, 360, 720.

822
00:51:03,293 --> 00:51:05,523
Like, change the axis.
Like, people are totally gonna blow minds.

823
00:51:05,595 --> 00:51:07,324
<i>Matrix. That's a great idea. Yeah.</i>

824
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:09,831
- Thank you. I wasn't fishing for that.
I appreciate it. - Maybe while I'm at it...

825
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,925
- I could...
- Bring it. Bring it.

826
00:51:12,002 --> 00:51:15,961
Maybe we could hoist it up on a cross...

827
00:51:16,039 --> 00:51:19,236
<i>and we have The Passion of the Guacamole.</i>

828
00:51:19,309 --> 00:51:22,437
Okay. I get it. Do you think that's funny?

829
00:51:22,512 --> 00:51:25,106
I think you're an idiot.

830
00:51:25,182 --> 00:51:27,116
And I quit.

831
00:51:28,185 --> 00:51:30,779
<i>- Told you... Hollywood.
- Can you hear me?</i>

832
00:51:30,854 --> 00:51:32,788
- Let's go.
- I think I have the wrong channel.

833
00:51:32,856 --> 00:51:34,687
- What?
- Let's go.

834
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:36,953
Hey. Hey, catch.

835
00:51:37,027 --> 00:51:40,121
Hey, whatever.
All right, I'm gonna shoot this.

836
00:51:40,197 --> 00:51:43,462
<i>Can you put him back in the ring?
I got an idea.</i>

837
00:51:43,533 --> 00:51:45,831
<i>- You're fired!
- Thank you!</i>

838
00:51:46,036 --> 00:51:49,062
<i>#She don't know who she is #</i>

839
00:51:49,139 --> 00:51:51,972
<i>#Oh, I can take her anywhere #</i>

840
00:51:52,042 --> 00:51:55,034
For years I had to deal with
this kind of stupidity.

841
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:57,046
Come on. Can you believe it?

842
00:51:57,114 --> 00:52:00,948
<i>I mean, you can't imagine how many times
I just wanted to walk off set like that.</i>

843
00:52:01,017 --> 00:52:04,976
- My God, I just walked off set.
- Yeah.

844
00:52:05,055 --> 00:52:07,580
And it looks like I just lost another job.

845
00:52:09,726 --> 00:52:12,456
That feels good. That feels great!

846
00:52:12,529 --> 00:52:14,861
<i>#With you eventually #</i>

847
00:52:33,683 --> 00:52:39,315

848
00:52:39,389 --> 00:52:41,823
<i>#A nd I always thought #</i>

849
00:52:41,892 --> 00:52:43,189
Come on.

850
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:46,593
<i>- #I would end up with you eventually #
- Ol! Ol!</i>

851
00:52:54,571 --> 00:52:57,131
<i>Can we go? You guys ready?</i>

852
00:52:57,207 --> 00:53:00,643
- Where's your guy? Who's your singer?
- Yeah, he's right behind you.

853
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:02,644
Hey, man, you're on.

854
00:53:12,956 --> 00:53:16,414
You guys good?

855
00:53:16,493 --> 00:53:19,223
So, my name is Adam Davies.

856
00:53:19,296 --> 00:53:21,389
I hope this doesn't make
anyone too uncomfortable...

857
00:53:21,464 --> 00:53:24,922
but I'm completely naked
under these clothes.

858
00:53:25,001 --> 00:53:28,095
This song is for someone...

859
00:53:28,171 --> 00:53:31,663
I, um, care about a lot.

860
00:53:35,612 --> 00:53:36,943
Ready?

861
00:53:53,363 --> 00:53:56,230
# I'm counting the streetlights #

862
00:53:57,334 --> 00:53:59,996
# It's all I can do #

863
00:54:01,304 --> 00:54:04,501

00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:07,407

865
00:54:08,979 --> 00:54:12,312

00:54:58,194 --> 00:55:02,062
You know what I thought when I met you?

876
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:04,066
No.

877
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:11,369
<i>- Aside from the incredible ears,
she's smart and stunning. -</i>

878
00:55:11,441 --> 00:55:13,875
- Absolutely stunning.
- Hmm.

879
00:55:13,943 --> 00:55:15,877
But there was something else.

880
00:55:18,381 --> 00:55:21,248
I just saw a girl that has the whole world
at her fingertips...

881
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:23,718
and she doesn't even know it.

882
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:07,193
Good night.

883
00:56:22,245 --> 00:56:24,179
Oh, my God.

884
00:56:24,247 --> 00:56:27,842
Oh, I'm such an idiot. I completely forgot.

885
00:56:27,917 --> 00:56:29,885
- It's cool.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

886
00:56:31,154 --> 00:56:32,644
How was it?

887
00:56:33,656 --> 00:56:37,251
Great. Fine, good... I...

888
00:56:37,327 --> 00:56:40,990
And our dinner... I missed our fancy dinner.

889
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:45,091
You're getting overly worked up about this,
Ryden. It's...

890
00:56:45,168 --> 00:56:47,102
It's cool.

891
00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:49,900
Besides, you were clearly busy with...

892
00:56:49,973 --> 00:56:51,964
Pel from across the street.

893
00:56:52,041 --> 00:56:54,532
Oh, no, he... We were at work...

894
00:56:54,611 --> 00:56:57,603
- and then there was this big blowup,
so we left, but it was... - Uh-huh.

895
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:01,241
Awesome. I'll see you later.

896
00:57:01,317 --> 00:57:05,048
- Wait. What are you doing?
- What does it look like?

897
00:57:05,121 --> 00:57:07,351
Just let me explain.

898
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:11,493
What exactly needs explanation?

899
00:57:11,561 --> 00:57:13,552
The fact that I've been
waiting around like a moron...

900
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:17,430
hoping that one day you'll actually
feel about me the way I feel about you?

901
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:20,060
Or the fact that you're so obsessed
with your future...

902
00:57:20,136 --> 00:57:24,800
that y-you completely forget about everyone
that you're supposed to give a shit about?

903
00:57:29,579 --> 00:57:34,107
I'm not waiting anymore. I'm done.

904
00:57:38,354 --> 00:57:42,654
I may not know exactly what my future
looks like, but I do know one thing.

905
00:57:45,995 --> 00:57:47,986
You're not in it.

906
00:58:12,956 --> 00:58:14,947
Oh...

907
00:58:20,563 --> 00:58:23,157
...say can and will be used against
you, okay? - I didn't know they were hot.

908
00:58:23,233 --> 00:58:25,497
- You have the right to an attorney.
- Bought them on the Internet.

909
00:58:25,568 --> 00:58:27,654
Can't afford one, one will
be provided to you by the state.

910
00:58:27,655 --> 00:58:29,218
This is so stupid. I can't...

911
00:58:30,106 --> 00:58:32,040
Didn't have to be this way.

912
00:58:32,108 --> 00:58:34,576
<i>Grab your brother. Get him in the car.</i>

913
00:58:34,644 --> 00:58:36,908
Come on, honey.
Come on. Let's go get in the car.

914
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:38,914
I had absolutely nothing to do with this.

915
00:58:38,982 --> 00:58:42,179
You can ask anybody,
and they'll tell you. I hate crime.

916
00:58:42,252 --> 00:58:44,812
It's okay. It's okay.

917
00:58:58,334 --> 00:59:01,394
The good news is your husband
doesn't have any priors.

918
00:59:01,471 --> 00:59:03,462
The bad news is we're
gonna have to hold him.

919
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:06,202
Trafficking stolen
property is no small crime.

920
00:59:06,276 --> 00:59:09,109
- The bail won't be set till tomorrow.
- You're keeping him overnight?

921
00:59:09,178 --> 00:59:11,976
- But he's not a criminal. He's
just a moron. - That's the breaks.

922
00:59:14,017 --> 00:59:18,477
I told you. I told you in
1976. Do not marry Walter Malby.

923
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:20,284
<i>He's your son.</i>

924
00:59:20,356 --> 00:59:22,950
- And I did the best I could with
what I had. -

925
00:59:23,026 --> 00:59:27,656
Yeah, well, your best effort is in jail
till tomorrow morning.

926
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:31,894
Hey. Pick up. I've called you 80 times.
I'm really, really sorry.

927
00:59:31,968 --> 00:59:35,404
I... Call me back.

928
00:59:35,471 --> 00:59:39,407
Where's Dad? I wanna go home.

929
00:59:49,319 --> 00:59:51,287
Try and have a good one, all right?

930
00:59:55,558 --> 00:59:58,925
Mrs. Malby? Miss?

931
00:59:58,995 --> 01:00:00,895
<i>Yes? Yes?</i>

932
01:00:00,964 --> 01:00:02,898
<i>- Hey, morning. How you doing?
- Hi. Morning.</i>

933
01:00:02,966 --> 01:00:06,766
<i>Um, so, basically, in order to bail him out,
you're looking at 15,000 bucks.</i>

934
01:00:06,836 --> 01:00:09,771
- Oh, my God. What? - Or he stays
in the slammer until the trial.

935
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:11,830
Oh, God.

936
01:00:13,142 --> 01:00:15,372
$15,000.

937
01:00:18,748 --> 01:00:20,682
Well, let's go home.

938
01:00:22,185 --> 01:00:24,119
- Maureen?
- What?

939
01:00:24,187 --> 01:00:26,621
Wait.

940
01:00:26,689 --> 01:00:28,953
Cough it up.

941
01:00:29,025 --> 01:00:30,390
Cough what up?

942
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:33,554
Pay the man your son's bail money.

943
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:36,292
Are you crazy?

944
01:00:36,366 --> 01:00:39,529
You think if I had that kind of dough
I'd be living with you?

945
01:00:39,602 --> 01:00:42,730
Cut the baloney, Maureen. Please.

946
01:00:42,805 --> 01:00:47,367
I know you have money.
I know you sew it into your panty hose.

947
01:00:47,443 --> 01:00:50,344
And I know you've got
it under your mattress...

948
01:00:50,413 --> 01:00:54,315
<i>and shoved up inside
every shoe in your closet.</i>

949
01:00:54,384 --> 01:00:56,375
Pay the man.

950
01:00:58,788 --> 01:01:03,088
Why can't my family just
love me for my soul...

951
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:07,027
instead of my meager possessions
and my bank account?

952
01:01:07,096 --> 01:01:09,496
Well, I love your soul, Grandma.

953
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:27,510
Okay, um... Will you take a check,
or do you want the green stuff?

954
01:01:30,653 --> 01:01:32,644
<i>I'm free!</i>

955
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:36,257
I'm free!

956
01:01:38,327 --> 01:01:42,058
Look at the sky.
Can you see how blue the sky is?

957
01:01:43,132 --> 01:01:46,260
This entire experience has transformed me.

958
01:01:46,335 --> 01:01:48,963
I am a new man. The old Walter is dead.

959
01:01:49,038 --> 01:01:52,405
But the new Walter
wants to say how much I love you guys.

960
01:01:52,475 --> 01:01:54,636
I'm a new man, and we're a new family.

961
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:58,442
<i>I mean, look,
we have our problems. What family doesn't?</i>

962
01:01:58,514 --> 01:01:59,978
I know I get to be bullheaded. And,

963
01:01:59,979 --> 01:02:03,485
you know, Ryden here is
essentially unemployable.

964
01:02:03,486 --> 01:02:04,748
Hmm?

965
01:02:04,821 --> 01:02:08,279
Hunter licks people, and...

966
01:02:08,357 --> 01:02:12,293
Grandma's very, very...

967
01:02:12,361 --> 01:02:14,261
very... kind.

968
01:02:14,330 --> 01:02:16,264
So kind.

969
01:02:16,332 --> 01:02:20,894
<i>But, no matter what, we're a family.
We're a real family.</i>

970
01:02:20,970 --> 01:02:23,495
We're the Malbys, damn it.

971
01:02:24,841 --> 01:02:28,402
From now on, it's Malby time.

972
01:02:28,478 --> 01:02:32,642
Malby! Malby! Malby!

973
01:02:32,715 --> 01:02:35,582
Malby! Malby! Malby!

974
01:02:35,651 --> 01:02:38,552
Malby! Malby! Malby!

975
01:02:38,621 --> 01:02:42,284
Malby! Malby! Malby! Malby!

976
01:02:42,358 --> 01:02:45,293
Malby! Malby! Malby!

977
01:02:45,361 --> 01:02:48,694
Malby! Malby! Malby!

978
01:02:51,534 --> 01:02:54,662
That's all right, honey.
I'll just take a cab over to the curb.

979
01:02:54,737 --> 01:02:57,103
<i>- Malby!
- Grab my purse.</i>

980
01:02:57,173 --> 01:02:59,300
- My purse. - Did you leave it
at the police station, Maureen?

981
01:02:59,375 --> 01:03:01,866
<i>- No, I didn't leave... I thought
you had it. -</i>

982
01:03:01,944 --> 01:03:04,071
<i>- I don't have your purse.
- Adam?</i>

983
01:03:04,147 --> 01:03:07,674
- I'm looking for Ryden Malby.
- That's me.

984
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:10,913
This is Barbara Snaff
from Happerman & Browning.

985
01:03:10,987 --> 01:03:14,923
Listen, the position you interviewed for
just came available again.

986
01:03:14,991 --> 01:03:17,619
You wanna fire me? Fine. I don't care.

987
01:03:17,693 --> 01:03:20,992
I'm gonna own this town. And I'm gonna come
back, and I'm gonna take you down.

988
01:03:21,063 --> 01:03:23,691
Wait... Wait, are you serious?
You're offering me the job?

989
01:03:23,766 --> 01:03:27,668
Yes. Absolutely. When can you start?
The job is yours if you want it.

990
01:03:27,737 --> 01:03:30,365
Immediately! Absolutely, yes.

991
01:03:30,439 --> 01:03:33,533
Great. I'll have my assistant call you
with all the details.

992
01:03:33,609 --> 01:03:35,770
- Thank you. Perfect.
- She's not there anymore.

993
01:03:35,845 --> 01:03:38,643
- Guys, I got the job! I got the job!
- Yea!

994
01:03:38,714 --> 01:03:42,206
<i>- Does it pay? Does it pay?
- Yeah, it pays!</i>

995
01:03:42,285 --> 01:03:45,311
- Malby! Malby!
- Malby! Malby!

996
01:03:45,388 --> 01:03:47,481
- Malby! Malby!
- She got a job!

997
01:03:52,094 --> 01:03:53,356
Okay.

998
01:03:58,467 --> 01:04:01,368
Yo, it's Adam. You know what to do.

999
01:04:02,371 --> 01:04:05,499
Okay. Silent treatment. I get it.

1000
01:04:05,575 --> 01:04:09,409
<i>Very fifth grade of you. But very effective.</i>

1001
01:04:09,478 --> 01:04:13,471
<i>Please call me. Please?</i>

1002
01:04:27,663 --> 01:04:30,496
Yo, it's Adam. You know what to do.

1003
01:04:31,968 --> 01:04:33,902
All right.

1004
01:04:35,338 --> 01:04:38,330
Just... call me when you're ready.

1005
01:04:56,292 --> 01:04:58,692
Yo, yo.

1006
01:04:58,761 --> 01:05:01,457
I got him. I got him.

1007
01:05:01,530 --> 01:05:05,159
<i>Yeah, yeah, go. Go, Adam.
Take it in. Take it in.</i>

1008
01:05:05,234 --> 01:05:06,223
<i>Yes!</i>

1009
01:05:06,302 --> 01:05:09,066
- Nice shot.
- All right. Check ball.

1010
01:05:09,138 --> 01:05:11,800
<i>I'm open right here.</i>

1011
01:05:20,549 --> 01:05:23,347
Someone once told me that every...

1012
01:05:23,419 --> 01:05:25,717
evil, horrible thing in the world...

1013
01:05:25,788 --> 01:05:30,418
can be directly counteracted by
the joy of a simple dessert.

1014
01:05:30,493 --> 01:05:32,893
<i>I'm really sorry, Adam.</i>

1015
01:05:32,962 --> 01:05:34,063
I know you don't wanna talk to me,

1016
01:05:34,064 --> 01:05:37,120
but I really have something
to tell you. I wish you...

1017
01:05:37,155 --> 01:05:38,760
Hold on a second.

1018
01:05:40,002 --> 01:05:42,835
If you don't forgive
me, I will follow you...

1019
01:05:42,905 --> 01:05:46,272
<i>everywhere you go,
playing this extremely annoying song...</i>

1020
01:05:46,342 --> 01:05:49,209
till you slowly go insane.

1021
01:05:52,181 --> 01:05:54,149
Okay. Just make it stop.

1022
01:05:54,216 --> 01:05:56,207
Ha!

1023
01:05:59,689 --> 01:06:01,850
<i>How do you steal an ice cream truck?</i>

1024
01:06:01,924 --> 01:06:03,585
Borrow.

1025
01:06:03,659 --> 01:06:06,184
My dad knows a guy that knows a guy, so...

1026
01:06:06,262 --> 01:06:07,991
Of course.

1027
01:06:10,132 --> 01:06:11,622
Look.

1028
01:06:15,705 --> 01:06:17,639
I'm good.

1029
01:06:20,643 --> 01:06:23,237
I'm so sorry I flaked on you, Adam.

1030
01:06:23,312 --> 01:06:25,803
You would never do anything like that to me.

1031
01:06:25,881 --> 01:06:27,872
And I've been thinking a lot about...

1032
01:06:27,950 --> 01:06:30,680
- I accept your apology.
- Wait. You have to let me get this out.

1033
01:06:30,753 --> 01:06:33,688
I have been thinking a lot
about what you said...

1034
01:06:33,756 --> 01:06:37,590
and I think you just...
maybe you just threw me because...

1035
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:40,220
Look, it's fine.

1036
01:06:40,296 --> 01:06:43,754
Really, it's... It's all good.

1037
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:47,360
I'm just...
You know, I'm in the middle of a game.

1038
01:06:47,436 --> 01:06:49,427
- Yo.
- Well, wait.

1039
01:06:49,505 --> 01:06:52,804
Um, do you wanna,
I don't know, hang out later? Um...

1040
01:06:52,875 --> 01:06:55,537
Oh, we could celebrate,
'cause I didn't get a chance to tell you...

1041
01:06:55,611 --> 01:06:57,772
but I got that job at Happerman & Browning.

1042
01:07:00,249 --> 01:07:02,274
That's awesome.

1043
01:07:02,351 --> 01:07:04,342
Uh, I...

1044
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:07,514
But I can't get together later,
'cause I kind of need to pack.

1045
01:07:07,590 --> 01:07:09,717
Pack?

1046
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:13,824
Yeah. Uh...

1047
01:07:13,896 --> 01:07:15,864
Look, I didn't get a chance to tell you...

1048
01:07:15,931 --> 01:07:18,297
but I decided to go to Columbia.

1049
01:07:20,436 --> 01:07:23,303
And I'm leaving tomorrow.

1050
01:07:23,372 --> 01:07:26,933
What? You're going to law school?

1051
01:07:27,009 --> 01:07:28,943
In New York?

1052
01:07:29,011 --> 01:07:31,070
Yeah.

1053
01:07:32,314 --> 01:07:34,441
That's...

1054
01:07:34,517 --> 01:07:37,384
That's... so great.

1055
01:07:37,453 --> 01:07:39,921
- Congratulations. - Yeah, I think
it'll be... I think it'll be good.

1056
01:07:43,325 --> 01:07:45,316
Look, I promise I'll call you...

1057
01:07:45,394 --> 01:07:48,056
as soon as I get settled in, okay?

1058
01:07:48,130 --> 01:07:50,189
<i>- Okay.
- Let's go.</i>

1059
01:07:50,266 --> 01:07:52,291
<i>Come on, Adam. Ball in. Ball in. Ball in.</i>

1060
01:07:52,368 --> 01:07:54,768
<i>Hold up.</i>

1061
01:07:54,837 --> 01:07:56,600
<i>- Our ball.
- All right.</i>

1062
01:08:01,143 --> 01:08:03,737
<i>- Our ball.
- Check it up. Check it up, Adam.</i>

1063
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:05,975
Our ball.

1064
01:08:09,652 --> 01:08:11,586
All right.

1065
01:08:15,024 --> 01:08:16,252
Ball.

1066
01:08:19,061 --> 01:08:20,995
Okay.

1067

Hi. I'm Ryden Malby. I'm...

01:08:53,095 --> 01:08:55,723
The new assistant to the editor. Yes.
One sec. I'll get Lloyd.

- That's the mail cart.
- Great. Well, perfect.

1072
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:07,034
Is there any material
you want me to start to read or...

1073
01:09:07,109 --> 01:09:08,770
No. Reading's on your own time.

1074
01:09:08,844 --> 01:09:12,837
Jessica was a shit filer,
so we're a little backed up on submissions.

1075
01:09:12,915 --> 01:09:16,476
I see that.
What happened toJessica anyway?

1076
01:09:16,552 --> 01:09:19,988
Well, we had a little bit of
a misunderstanding, she and I.

1077
01:09:20,055 --> 01:09:23,821
You see, I thought that she worked for me.
She thought she was running the company.

1078
01:09:23,893 --> 01:09:25,827
- Sounds likeJessica.
- Mm-hmm.

1079

- Yep, I'll get right on it.

1080
01:09:28,430 --> 01:09:31,228

one of these into the database, right?

1081
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:33,234
Okay. Absolutely. Yeah.

too much crap to keep in my own brain.

1090
01:10:02,431 --> 01:10:03,693
So, what do I do?

01:19:21,790 --> 01:19:25,453
kept your room neat and clean,
you ate your vegetables.

1218
01:19:27,462 --> 01:19:29,396
Can I be honest with you?

1219
01:19:29,464 --> 01:19:31,830
I always found it a little troubling.

1220
01:19:31,900 --> 01:19:35,358
<i>Because, see, hon...</i>

1221
01:19:36,738 --> 01:19:38,672
the world's a screwy place.

1222
01:19:38,740 --> 01:19:40,799
It doesn't play by the rules.

1223
01:19:42,644 --> 01:19:45,511
So if you're asking me...

1224
01:19:45,580 --> 01:19:48,913
do I think it's a good
idea for you to, uh...

1225
01:19:48,984 --> 01:19:51,418
quit your job...

1226
01:19:51,486 --> 01:19:53,420
leave behind the only family you have...

1227
01:19:53,488 --> 01:19:56,082
and travel 3,000 miles...

1228
01:19:56,158 --> 01:19:58,149
to a place you've never been before?

1229
01:20:01,563 --> 01:20:04,555
I think it's the most kick-ass idea
you've ever had.

1230
01:20:07,235 --> 01:20:11,501
'Cause I think no matter where you are,
you're gonna knock 'em dead.

1231
01:20:14,075 --> 01:20:16,043
Thanks, Dad.

1232
01:20:22,050 --> 01:20:23,210
- See ya.
- Okay.

1233
01:20:23,285 --> 01:20:25,253
- Love ya, honey.
- Love ya. Bye.

1234
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:27,345
No good-byes. Just see you later.

1235
01:20:27,422 --> 01:20:30,050
You be careful in New York.
There are a bunch of kookies there.

1236
01:20:30,125 --> 01:20:32,559
- Okay, I will.
- Call me frequently, okay?

1237
01:20:32,627 --> 01:20:35,460
- Okay. - I've got you on my
speed dial, and you're on mine.

Hey.

1260
01:22:12,727 --> 01:22:14,957
Life sucks without you.

1261
01:22:15,030 --> 01:22:18,431
I miss you. I...
Well, of course I miss you. I...

1262
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:22,027
I knew that I would, but it's not like a...

1263

"Hey, we had some great times...
you know, keep in touch" kind of thing.

1264
01:22:25,573 --> 01:22:30,601
It's... It was more like,
"I can't eat... I can't sleep...

1265
01:22:30,679 --> 01:22:34,775
I forget what it feels like to laugh"
kind of thing.

1266
01:22:34,849 --> 01:22:38,785
And I really think that when you left...

1267
01:22:38,853 --> 01:22:41,185
you took my heart with you.

1268
01:22:51,433 --> 01:22:54,027
Um...

1269
01:22:54,102 --> 01:22:56,127
I- I probably should've called first.

1270
01:22:56,204 --> 01:22:58,468
Oh, whoa. Whoa. No, no, no. Hold...

1271

Ryden! Whoa!
Where are you... Where are you going?

01:23:02,644 --> 01:23:04,305
Ryden!

She's my R.A.

1276
01:23:21,629 --> 01:23:24,689
I was just filling out a maintenance report.

- No.

Really?

1279

Yeah.

1280
01:23:49,324 --> 01:23:51,258
I love you.

Oh. Hey, guess who's coming for a visit.

1290

We got cheap-ass tickets

'cause Grandma's got that heinous hump.

1292
01:24:27,729 --> 01:24:29,959
- 'Cause I don't wanna have her
suffering more than she... - Stop that!

1293
01:24:30,031 --> 01:24:31,965
I don't have a hump! Give me that.

1294

so take your calcium.

You're from California.
