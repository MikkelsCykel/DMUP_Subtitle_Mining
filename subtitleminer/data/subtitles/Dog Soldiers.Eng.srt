1
00:00:34,076 --> 00:00:37,120
You were right.

2
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:39,622
This is definitely better
than being at work.

3
00:00:39,707 --> 00:00:43,793
One thing you didn't warn us
about though, bloody midges.

4
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:46,462
You are a big
girl's blouse.

5
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:49,090
Anyway, now that
you've mentioned work,

6
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:53,511
and seeing that I bullied you to come all
the way out here to celebrate the fact,

7
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:01,018
here.

8
00:01:01,103 --> 00:01:03,312
Congratulations.

9
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:05,982
No knight should be
without his sword.

10
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:09,986
I don't know
what to say.

11
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,822
My writer
lost for words?

12
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,323
It's perfect.

13
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:17,660
Yeah, and it's also solid
silver, so don't lose it.

14
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:20,741
Nice try, Private Cooper.

15
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:24,120
You evaded capture
for 22 hours

16
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,455
and 47 minutes.

17
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,375
You're straight to
the head of the class.

18
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:32,003
Of course the real
trick to survival

19
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:34,130
lies not from
running and hiding,

20
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:38,467
but in removing your enemy's
capacity to hunt you down.

21
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:46,017
Here. Shoot the dog.

22
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:51,564
I'm sorry, sir, what?

23
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,568
Take the weapon
and use it.

24
00:03:57,654 --> 00:04:02,241
During the selection process,
you are under my command.

25
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:05,244
That's a direct
order, Cooper.

26
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,706
You're taking
a piss, right?

27
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:12,209
He thinks I'm pulling his leg. Do I
look like a sodding comedian, shit?

28
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:14,587
No, sir.

29
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,132
I still won't do it.

30
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:21,886
You don't have a choice.
Finish the job. Shoot the dog.

31
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:24,388
Shoot it!

32
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:25,890
No, sir!

33
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:32,438
What use are you
to my team

34
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:35,524
if you can't
even kill a dog?

35
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:38,611
I didn't say I couldn't kill a dog, sir.

36
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:41,405
I just will not kill
that dog for no reason.

37
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,452
You're bent, Cooper. I don't
need a man of conscience.

38
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:47,912
You're failing me
for this?

39
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,705
You failed yourself.

40
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:54,585
We're on a different
level here, Cooper.

41
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:59,131
For that, I need
men of action.

42
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:01,801
Not deeds.

43
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:06,722
No!

44
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:09,725
You sick
fucking bastard.

45
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,894
It was just a dog.
That's all.

46
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:17,066
Maybe one day when that's
sunk into your thick skull,

47
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,069
you'll be ready
for us.

48
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,613
Until then, you
live and learn.

49
00:05:22,698 --> 00:05:24,782
Yeah. You don't.

50
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:34,709
I don't do second
chances, Cooper.

51
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:38,295
And I never forget.

52
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,927
Owe to you this
pathetic piece of shit.

53
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:48,889
Send him back
to his squad.

54
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,742
I want a good
clean dispersal

55
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,702
and a secure
landing zone.

56
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,247
Go, go, go, go, go.

57
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:04,882
Joe, get out
of the chopper.

58
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:07,510
I'm not missing the footy
for this, it's totally bone!

59
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,261
I'm not going.

60
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,166
They're up.

61
00:07:47,843 --> 00:07:52,721
Cooper. I want a position and
bearing. Wanna move in three minutes.

62
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,223
On it.

63
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,225
Spoon, Terry,
you're on stag.

64
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,435
Joe, for fuck sake.

65
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,231
Get off your big fat lardy
ass and make like a soldier.

66
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:07,736
Right then.
Time sync.

67
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:11,949
I've got 07:30.
Coming up in three,

68
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,951
two, one.
Check.

69
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,661
Bollocks. I don't
believe this.

70
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,246
What is it now,
Witherspoon?

71
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,331
Left me watch at
the barracks, Sarge.

72
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,750
Take a breather every
once in a while.

73
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,502
Nice work, Spoon,
you tosser.

74
00:08:23,587 --> 00:08:25,254
Took the words
right off my mouth.

75
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:28,340
You will take my boot out
of your mouth, Joe, you twat.

76
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:30,259
Piss now.

77
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,136
This shit is
totally bone.

78
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:35,014
The most important football match
of my life is playing tonight

79
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:38,934
and I'm stuck at the back side of
beyond without a six pack or a telly.

80
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,436
That's the army for you.

81
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,147
It's England v. Germany,
man. Full on footy war.

82
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,441
Well, it's nothing like
this at all, isn't, Joe?

83
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,277
It's just an exercise.
Hardly life or death.

84
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,404
Don't bet on it, Joe.
You're fucking slaying me.

85
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,449
If you'd paid any attention at
all during the briefing, Kirkley,

86
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,577
you'd know exactly who we're up
against on this harmless exercise.

87
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:57,953
Who's that then?

88
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:00,122
Special Forces, you plunker.

89
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:01,332
Bollocks to them.

90
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,959
All right. All right. Listen up.

91
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:06,253
I'm gonna make this
quick and to the point.

92
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:09,131
All I wanna do is get
home, jump into a warm bed

93
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:11,342
with a nice hot woman
and watch the footy.

94
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:13,010
Planning on scoring, Sarge?

95
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:15,512
Mind you don't foul her
in the penalty box.

96
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:17,514
All right. Ban it,
private parts.

97
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:19,767
As for this moment
as far as we're concerned,

98
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:24,146
we are 50k behind enemy lines. Now,
if we do happen to make a contact,

99
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:28,108
I expect nothing less than gratuitous
violence from the lot of you.

100
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:32,404
As we're firing blanks, it doesn't mean
we have to be thinking nice thoughts.

101
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:34,323
So, you remember,
you put five down.

102
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:37,868
You get stuck in, you kick their fucking
teeth out or I guarantee you, Joe,

103
00:09:37,953 --> 00:09:40,287
they will be having your
bollocks for breakfast.

104
00:09:40,372 --> 00:09:42,248
Hard boiled
or fried, Sarge?

105
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:43,874
Scrambled.

106
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:45,334
Here, Spoonie.

107
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,419
Oh, smart.

108
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:51,340
That's nice and new and shinny doesn't mean
it's worth shit. Remember I want that back.

109
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,342
What about you, Sarge?

110
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,219
Well, I'll count.

111
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:57,638
Right then, Coop,
what we got?

112
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,851
We're here. The front
line is here.

113
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:06,188
AWAK reports enemy positions
here, here and here,

114
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:08,857
with sweeping patrols
between each of these bunkers.

115
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:12,361
Have all the whole sector wrapped
tighter than an Eskimo's nutsack.

116
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,571
With one exception
right here.

117
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:18,367
A river crosses the line through
a gorge 30 or 40 feet deep.

118
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,828
It's certain to have a patrol
on it but if we go at night,

119
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:23,372
tread careful and don't
mind getting our feet wet,

120
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:26,125
I reckon we can
make it through.

121
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:28,127
What the fuck is
all this about then?

122
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:30,379
More likely I'll need
all the help I can get.

123
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:33,173
Hey, listen. I know you think
it was a piss pool cooled you.

124
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:37,928
Failing selection and all that,
but I got to say I'm not sorry.

125
00:10:38,013 --> 00:10:40,347
This squad would be
a lot worse without you.

126
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:41,932
Something I had
to do, you know.

127
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:43,600
For myself, get it
out the system.

128
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:46,895
The only people going
into trouble are Kamikazes.

129
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,107
Glory boys and full
on fucking fatwits.

130
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:53,319
Take my advice, son.
Be patient.

131
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:56,113
Right then, ladies.
Pack up your troubles,

132
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:58,741
put your brains in first
gear and start tabbing.

133
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:01,785
Spoonie, you're on point.
Terry, Joe, tail in Charlie.

134
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:07,499
Over here, Cooper.
On me head.

135
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:10,419
Twater.

136
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:13,714
I can't believe I'm missing
the footy for this party.

137
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:18,344
Joe, if you don't shut up, I swear to
God I'm gonna shut you myself. Now, move.

138
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:20,512
Didn't say a word, Sarge.

139
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,102
Where the hell
are we now?

140
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:55,881
I heard a cracking
story about this place.

141
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,508
You what?

142
00:11:57,592 --> 00:11:59,968
People disappear out here.
It happens all the time.

143
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:02,012
Come on, Cooper.
Give it some bollocks.

144
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:05,682
It's true. Just last month a young
couple were hiking through these woods.

145
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:10,062
They set up camp somewhere near here.
During the night, something happened.

146
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:13,399
A rescue team found the remains
of the camp a couple of days later.

147
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:17,486
The tent was ripped to threads
and there was blood everywhere.

148
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:21,073
The papers said it was a monster,
like the beast of Bodmin Moor.

149
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:23,992
The locals claimed
it was an escaped lunatic.

150
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:28,038
But no one's been caught, so
nothing could be proved either way.

151
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:30,707
Every year, more and more
people come through here.

152
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:34,336
Every once in a while they don't
come back. No trace, no bodies.

153
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:38,298
Just disappear and
never seen again.

154
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,802
Oh!

155
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,138
Contact camp.

156
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:29,266
Tell them the flock is
heading for the fold.

157
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,651
Then, Bruce,
what scares you?

158
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:42,738
The self-destructive nature
of the human condition.

159
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,698
Just taking a piss now.

160
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,200
You think so?

161
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:47,618
What about you, Spoon?

162
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:49,495
Castration.

163
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:53,957
There's no argument
there. Joe?

164
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:58,462
Only one thing that puts the
shit at me. A penalty shoot-out.

165
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:00,964
That figures. Terry?

166
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:05,260
Watching a penalty
shoot-out... with Joe.

167
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:08,472
What about you, Coop?

168
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:11,266
Spiders.
And women.

169
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:16,146
And, uh, spider women.

170
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:19,983
I want to know
what scares the Sarge.

171
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:22,653
Piss of, man. Nothing
scares the Sarge.

172
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:24,696
I don't know
about that.

173
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:28,242
The thought of never seeing my wife
again scares the shit out of me.

174
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:33,789
That and those little things
that make your skin crawl

175
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,333
and the hairs stand up
at the back of your neck.

176
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,335
You mean like Spoon?

177
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:45,968
There's one thing actually in particular
that I'll remember until the day I die.

178
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:49,763
It's back in '91, just before
my unit was flying out to Kuwait

179
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:52,558
to mop up the last
pockets of resistance.

180
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:56,270
Me and this young fellow
called Eddie Oswald

181
00:14:56,396 --> 00:15:00,607
decided to go and get a tattoo done to
commemorate our first trip into the desert.

182
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:04,027
I remember Ed. He was a stocky hard case

183
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:06,363
with a broken nose
and a bone eye, eh?

184
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:09,908
Yeah, that's him. Good-looking
fellow. Big hit with the ladies.

185
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,496
Anyway, me and Eddie,

186
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:17,457
we had a few drinks.
We had a lot of drinks.

187
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:20,711
And we went down to the tattoo
parlor, and I got a desert rat done.

188
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:23,755
And Eddie being Eddie wanted
something a bit more meaning.

189
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,341
And being a bit
of a believer,

190
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:30,345
he said that his soul
still belonged to God.

191
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:34,725
But his flesh was way
beyond redemption.

192
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:38,270
It was up to Satan
to save his skin.

193
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:42,024
So he got this fucking great laughing
devil tattoo right on his ass.

194
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:48,822
Anyway, about six days later, we were making
a regular sweep along the, uh, Iraqi border.

195
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:53,744
And, uh, Eddie, poor fucker,
triggered an antitank mine.

196
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:58,957
Yeah. We all saw it
happen. He was on point.

197
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:01,668
A white, blinding
lightning flash

198
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:05,631
and a fucking deafening crack. By the
time we picked ourselves up of the deck,

199
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:07,466
Eddie was-

200
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:10,594
He was gone.

201
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,430
Just bits and
pieces of him.

202
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:17,851
It's all that remained. This big
fucking red circle a hundred meters.

203
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:23,565
I'll tell you something, lads. It
really puts things in perspective

204
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:28,320
when you have to scoop your mate up
with a shovel and stick him in a bin bag.

205
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:32,658
Anyway, the thing that really
did our nuts in that day

206
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:37,329
was when you, uh, came
across the bit you recognized.

207
00:16:39,374 --> 00:16:43,043
A bit of an ear, a toe, a nose, a tooth.

208
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:47,381
The thing that really
freaked us out that day

209
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:51,343
was when left-hand Charlie found
a bit of Eddie with the tattoo on.

210
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,929
I mean, everything else was burned
to a crisp covered in claret.

211
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,722
All mushed up,
pocked up.

212
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:59,476
Not this bit.
This bit was perfect.

213
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:03,355
And there's old Nick chalking
his fucking ass all over us.

214
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:08,110
So you could say
that Eddie was right.

215
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:13,949
That Satan did indeed save
his skin, just not all of it.

216
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,910
Or you could say that
Eddie was just unlucky.

217
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:21,248
Either way.

218
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:24,501
It taught me to keep
a very open mind.

219
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:27,963
Boom, boom.

220
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:33,552
Anyway.

221
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:37,556
Eddie Oswald.

222
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:40,058
To Eddie.

223
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:53,196
So, this bloke
walks into a pub

224
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:57,743
with a dog under his arm. Puts his
arm on the bar, goes and sits down.

225
00:17:57,827 --> 00:18:00,662
The bartender is looking and
thinking, "What is going on here?"

226
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:03,707
He looks back at the
dog and the dog turns on-

227
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,208
Fucking cow!

228
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,671
Ceasefire, Terry.
Ceasefire.

229
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:11,673
Terry, what the hell
are you doing?

230
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:13,175
You're firing
blanks, man.

231
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:15,010
Is everyone all right?
Is everyone okay?

232
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,053
No. I think
I've shit meself.

233
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,391
Is it dead?

234
00:18:21,476 --> 00:18:23,560
Oh, yeah, it's dead.

235
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,854
Look at the state of it.

236
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,564
Look at the state
of Terry.

237
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:33,445
These aren't entry wounds.
More like teeth marks.

238
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,113
What are you
saying, Cooper?

239
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:38,033
What he's saying, Terry, is
that it died of natural causes.

240
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,368
Don't you think we should
call this in, Sarge?

241
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:42,537
Aye. Go on
the radio, Bruce.

242
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:44,915
There's no way I'm about
to break radio silence

243
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:48,710
'cause you lot got spooked
by a dead flying fucking cow.

244
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:52,005
We have this position. We keep
it secure 'til the morning.

245
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:54,800
Then we reassess
the situation.

246
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:56,885
Right. I want
a watch posted.

247
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,554
Two on. Four off. Brucie,
Spoon. You're up first.

248
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:01,890
Cooper an I relieve at 0100 hours.

249
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:05,602
I n the meantime, Terry,
sort your kit out.

250
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:08,855
The rest of you
get your edge done.

251
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,607
Unbelievable.

252
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:02,492
Sarge?

253
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:10,417
Cow came in from this
direction, straight off the edge.

254
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,254
From the frying pan
into the fire.

255
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:18,133
Bleeding to death, it could've wandered
around for miles before it got here.

256
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,969
It's good of it to leave some
breadcrumbs for us to follow.

257
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,262
Looking for trouble?

258
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:24,306
No, Cooper.
Just looking.

259
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:27,809
Sarge, shouldn't we report
this when we get back?

260
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:31,813
You're right, Terry, but in the meantime
I'm curious, and it's on the way.

261
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:33,398
Come on, lads.

262
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,798
Natural causes
my ass.

263
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:43,969
Oh, now what?

264
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:36,604
Christ.

265
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:39,107
What the fucking hell
happened here, Sarge?

266
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:42,485
This is getting all
bone by the minute.

267
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:44,863
Jesus Christ, Sarge.

268
00:22:44,947 --> 00:22:47,782
All right, lads.
Get a grip.

269
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:51,453
We've got casualties.

270
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:53,246
Ditch your bargains.

271
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:57,625
Salvage whatever weapons
you can find, and stand to.

272
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:02,255
We are now up against
live, hostile targets.

273
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:06,051
If Little Red Riding Hood should show
up with a bazooka and a bad attitude,

274
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:09,637
I'd expect you
to chin the bitch.

275
00:23:09,764 --> 00:23:13,683
Looks like they got hit hard. Every magazine
is full. Nobody got up a single round.

276
00:23:13,768 --> 00:23:16,311
If they're lost, then
where are the bodies?

277
00:23:18,189 --> 00:23:21,441
Yeah. All right, Corporal.
Get on the net. Call in.

278
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,818
I want an emergency
air lift immediately.

279
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:33,036
Help me.

280
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:36,831
Captain?

281
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:39,292
Ryan? What
happened here?

282
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:41,503
Do not tell me
you know him.

283
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:43,588
Captain Ryan,
Special Ops.

284
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:46,758
No fucking dog lover.

285
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:51,429
Spearhead patrol. This is
spearhead patrol. Receiving?

286
00:23:51,514 --> 00:23:54,057
He looks like he took on
Jack the Ripper and came last.

287
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:56,518
I can patch him up, but
he needs a medic right now.

288
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:58,561
This is an
emergency. Code 64.

289
00:23:58,646 --> 00:24:01,356
You gotta get me out of
here. Do you understand?

290
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,191
There was only
supposed to be one.

291
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,026
We're working
on it, Captain.

292
00:24:05,111 --> 00:24:06,152
Sarge.

293
00:24:06,237 --> 00:24:07,570
Not now, Spoon.

294
00:24:07,655 --> 00:24:09,489
You're receiving?

295
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:12,492
Shit.

296
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:13,868
What's wrong, Bruce?

297
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:15,370
I can't find a signal.

298
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,163
Did you check it?

299
00:24:17,248 --> 00:24:19,707
Of course, and I double
checked it and it worked fine!

300
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:22,377
All right, Bruce, stay on
it. See what you can do.

301
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,712
Terry? They must've
had their own comms kit.

302
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:26,798
Have a look round. See
if you can find it. Go.

303
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:28,508
Sarge.

304
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:31,928
Spoon, have a shift on the camp.
See if you can find anything else.

305
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:33,888
Not now, Spoon.

306
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:36,474
This is spearhead patrol,
are you receiving me?

307
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:41,855
There was only
supposed to be one.

308
00:24:41,939 --> 00:24:44,774
Jesus! Charnel House
is compromised to fuck!

309
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:47,735
How is he doing here?

310
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,029
All I know is
he's special forces.

311
00:24:50,114 --> 00:24:53,575
If this is part of our exercise,
it's been not advertised.

312
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:56,744
No cap badge, no insignia. Just tags.

313
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:58,746
Some kind of
a covert action?

314
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:02,250
Covert action or not, they're
packing all kinds of weird shit.

315
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:05,753
Tranquilizer darts,
nets, you name it.

316
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:08,965
It's a special ops mission,
not a fucking safari.

317
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:11,426
Sarge? We found
that radio.

318
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,927
Shit, I don't believe it.

319
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:14,929
There was only
supposed to be one!

320
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:16,181
What's he on about?

321
00:25:16,265 --> 00:25:18,766
Terry, get back
on stag now.

322
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:22,061
You got to get me out of
here before they come back.

323
00:25:22,146 --> 00:25:24,439
Who, Captain? Who is going to come back?

324
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:28,902
They tore them to pieces
in front of my eyes.

325
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:32,947
If we don't get him somewhere warm
soon, he's gonna die of hypothermia.

326
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:35,783
Stay with me, Captain.
Captain Ryan, stay with me.

327
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:36,910
Sarge.

328
00:25:36,994 --> 00:25:38,203
Not now, Spoon.

329
00:25:38,287 --> 00:25:40,163
I n about half an hour
it's gonna be dark.

330
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:42,207
Does anybody copy?

331
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:50,673
Any joy?

332
00:25:50,758 --> 00:25:52,508
The fuses are blown.

333
00:25:52,593 --> 00:25:54,344
Can you fix it?

334
00:25:54,428 --> 00:25:57,055
Maybe it was faulty or maybe
some damp got in the casing,

335
00:25:57,139 --> 00:25:59,390
but it's fried
the circuits.

336
00:25:59,475 --> 00:26:03,645
Well, if it's
useless, bin it.

337
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:06,814
I also found this.

338
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:11,027
It's attached inside. Not part of
the radio. Looks like a transmitter.

339
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:13,029
Why would they put
a bug in our radio?

340
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:17,158
It's the Kobayashi Maru test. They
fixed it so we can't fucking win.

341
00:26:17,243 --> 00:26:19,577
Ban it, Spoon. Terry,
it's probably some joke.

342
00:26:19,662 --> 00:26:22,163
He didn't want Joe to
hear the footy results.

343
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:23,915
An early shot.

344
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:25,416
Anything useful?

345
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:29,045
Weapons, ammunition. A
couple of magnesium flares.

346
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:30,838
That's about it.

347
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:33,508
All right, lads. Ditch
your ITs. From here on in

348
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:36,427
the exercise is well
and truly over.

349
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:39,847
Anyone not carrying
life rounds, better do.

350
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:41,015
Bruce.

351
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,351
It won't make
any difference.

352
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,520
They won't die.

353
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:47,814
This gives me a better
peace of mind, sir.

354
00:26:47,898 --> 00:26:51,442
You want peace of mind? Run for your
lives before they tear your legs.

355
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:55,655
You just shut up
like a good gentleman.

356
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:58,032
You are scaring my lads.

357
00:27:04,707 --> 00:27:06,916
Oh, shit.

358
00:27:07,001 --> 00:27:09,377
All right, lads,
grab what you can.

359
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:12,213
Head to the tree line.
We're moving. Let's go.

360
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:29,188
Right. I need a volunteer
for rear guard action.

361
00:27:29,273 --> 00:27:30,857
I'll do it.

362
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:34,277
When we clear, you fall back.
We're gonna be there to cover you.

363
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:38,197
Off you go.
Bruce, no heroics.

364
00:27:38,282 --> 00:27:42,702
Spoonie, you're on point. Joe,
help Ryan. Terry, you're up next.

365
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:45,872
Coop, you and me. All right,
lads, in front the long grass.

366
00:27:45,956 --> 00:27:48,291
Double time. Go!

367
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:51,961
Come on, sunshine,
fucking shift it.

368
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,584
Come on!

369
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:20,276
Bruce. Bruce!

370
00:30:28,911 --> 00:30:30,661
Jesus!

371
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:38,085
Cooper, get out of here!
Jesus, I'm bit, mate.

372
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:41,672
You said no heroics, you
bloody hypocrite. Where's Bruce?

373
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:44,258
He's all over there. They
fucking tore him apart.

374
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:48,262
You piss off.
That is an order!

375
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:50,973
They're coming!

376
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,060
Fuck off.

377
00:30:54,144 --> 00:30:56,604
You can take your orders
and shovel them up your ass.

378
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,940
Oh, Jesus,
my guts are out.

379
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:01,150
We'll just put them
back in again.

380
00:31:01,235 --> 00:31:03,778
They're not gonna
fucking fit!

381
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,530
Of course
they'll fit, man.

382
00:31:05,614 --> 00:31:07,740
Here.

383
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:09,867
Come on.
Come on.

384
00:31:09,952 --> 00:31:11,786
Come on.

385
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:15,039
Come out of the fog.

386
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:20,586
God.

387
00:31:23,966 --> 00:31:25,466
To your rear!

388
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:27,051
A target!

389
00:31:30,556 --> 00:31:33,349
Target.

390
00:31:35,561 --> 00:31:37,687
Keep moving.

391
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:39,188
Covering fire.

392
00:31:39,273 --> 00:31:41,399
Backing guard.

393
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:48,656
Covering fire.

394
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:53,244
Coming through!

395
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:56,998
Target.

396
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:03,004
Reload!

397
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:09,677
Bloody hell!

398
00:32:11,221 --> 00:32:13,681
Just fucking lie down!

399
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:21,272
Lads.

400
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:25,443
On me.
On me!

401
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:38,205
Stop!

402
00:32:40,626 --> 00:32:41,792
Get in.

403
00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:43,544
Everybody on me!

404
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:45,087
Hurry.

405
00:32:45,172 --> 00:32:47,256
Fire!

406
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:56,724
Oh, shit!

407
00:33:03,023 --> 00:33:04,982
Just drive.

408
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:08,277
Now!

409
00:33:12,032 --> 00:33:14,283
They're fucking coming!

410
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:19,830
Come on, stab it!

411
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:22,833
Go reverse.

412
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:27,254
Stab it!

413
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:36,514
Go forward.

414
00:33:42,688 --> 00:33:43,854
Fuck!

415
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:50,611
Everything okay back there?
Any more casualties? Spoon?

416
00:33:50,696 --> 00:33:54,824
No, I'm all right. What
about Bruce? Where's Bruce?

417
00:33:54,908 --> 00:33:58,035
Bruce is, Bruce
is gone. He's gone.

418
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:02,206
Fuck it!

419
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:07,378
Just hang on back there.

420
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:10,798
Thank you.

421
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,758
It's okay.
What happened?

422
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:17,096
What happened? We were attacked by huge
fucking howling things. That's what.

423
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:19,974
You were lucky I found you.
I was about to give up hope.

424
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:21,976
And you were here?

425
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:25,104
I heard gunfire last night.
I knew someone was out there.

426
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:27,982
If you weren't already in
trouble, then you soon would be.

427
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:32,653
We are. Two men are down.
Both need medical attention.

428
00:34:32,738 --> 00:34:35,823
We need to dress the Sergeant's
wounds before we can take him too far.

429
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:38,534
There's only one
farm in this glen.

430
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:41,412
The owners are friends.
We can take him in there.

431
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,149
Hello?

432
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:19,366
Nobody home?

433
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:21,327
I don't know
where they could be.

434
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:25,039
Nice.

435
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:26,791
Stand back.

436
00:36:00,242 --> 00:36:04,829
Little pigs. Little pigs.
We've come to nick your video.

437
00:36:56,298 --> 00:36:58,674
Hey. Sit.

438
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:01,719
Hey. Sit, sit.

439
00:37:04,306 --> 00:37:09,018
You stay. Hm?

440
00:37:14,316 --> 00:37:15,816
All clear.

441
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:34,960
What the fuck happened
back there, Cooper?

442
00:37:35,045 --> 00:37:37,713
I don't know, mate.

443
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:39,715
She might have
some answers.

444
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:52,603
All clear upstairs.

445
00:37:56,066 --> 00:37:57,733
Where the hell
are we now?

446
00:37:57,817 --> 00:38:00,027
Home sweet home.

447
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:02,696
Sit him down.

448
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:04,865
Spoon, get a field
dressing on that wound.

449
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:07,451
Terry, keep an
eye out front.

450
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:22,383
Is there a
telephone here?

451
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:23,425
What? No.

452
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:24,969
It's still hot, lads.

453
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:26,720
You can't just
help yourself!

454
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:30,724
I'm chinstrapped and I'm bloody
starving. I can't help meself.

455
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:34,937
It's the training, miss. Never
waits an opportunity to eat. Come on.

456
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:39,608
Now look what
I'm doing.

457
00:38:39,693 --> 00:38:41,610
Get it down
your necks, lads.

458
00:38:53,123 --> 00:38:54,581
Hold it, hold it.

459
00:38:56,001 --> 00:38:57,459
Top grub.
What is it?

460
00:38:57,544 --> 00:38:59,628
Don't know, mate.
Looks like pork.

461
00:38:59,713 --> 00:39:02,506
Leave some for us,
you greedy mongrels.

462
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:05,092
Miss, where is
the nearest phone?

463
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:07,428
Fifty miles as
a crow flies.

464
00:39:14,227 --> 00:39:16,729
What about the nearest
population center?

465
00:39:16,813 --> 00:39:19,440
You mean a town?
Well, Fort William,

466
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:22,484
but it's at least a four-hour
drive back the way we just came.

467
00:39:22,569 --> 00:39:24,611
Do you think your
wounded can make it?

468
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:26,780
The Sarge is in serious
trouble if we don't.

469
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:28,824
You seem to know these
roads. Will you take us?

470
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:30,576
Right now?

471
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:33,746
Unless your friends are just gone.
This place may be compromised.

472
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:36,040
Fine. The sooner
the better. Let's go.

473
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:41,253
All right.
Spoon, on me.

474
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:43,797
Everyone else hang by until
we bring the car about.

475
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:47,676
Joe, help the Sarge.
Terry, watch him.

476
00:39:47,761 --> 00:39:50,095
The safeties off.

477
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:34,181
Spoon.

478
00:40:35,517 --> 00:40:38,769
Don't stare back.

479
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:41,772
I can't help it.

480
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:43,607
Go.

481
00:40:48,655 --> 00:40:51,115
Move on!

482
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:56,578
That puts a kibosh
on that plan.

483
00:40:56,663 --> 00:40:57,955
That was my car!

484
00:41:06,339 --> 00:41:08,423
Sam, no!

485
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:10,801
Oh.

486
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,762
Piss off.

487
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:22,396
Fuck that!

488
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,148
Step back!

489
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:25,649
Bloody hell!

490
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:31,613
Get the dog off me.

491
00:41:31,698 --> 00:41:32,823
No.

492
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:34,950
Pull the dog off me.

493
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:36,743
Sam.

494
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:38,662
Shut the dog up!

495
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:41,623
Sam, come here.

496
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:45,961
Terry, right flank.
Cover the window.

497
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:49,464
Christ.

498
00:41:55,388 --> 00:41:57,973
That's bloody
charming, that is.

499
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:04,438
You incompetent moron!

500
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:06,523
Do you wanna have
a fucking go like?

501
00:42:12,739 --> 00:42:14,448
Bathroom?

502
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:17,492
Upstairs. Far
end of passage.

503
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:20,370
We need to talk, Ryan.

504
00:42:20,455 --> 00:42:22,497
It doesn't look like I'm going anywhere.

505
00:42:22,582 --> 00:42:26,251
Joe, Spoon. Looks like we're
staying. You know what to do.

506
00:42:26,336 --> 00:42:28,921
I want a secure perimeter
with a clear field of fire.

507
00:42:29,005 --> 00:42:31,131
We'll give them something
inviting, right?

508
00:42:31,216 --> 00:42:33,133
I'm on it.

509
00:42:35,011 --> 00:42:36,970
Terry, are you okay?

510
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:39,139
I'm real craving
for a kebab.

511
00:42:39,224 --> 00:42:41,099
I'll take that
as a yes.

512
00:42:41,226 --> 00:42:45,354
We've got limited ammunition. I want you
to get as many pots and pan as you can.

513
00:42:45,438 --> 00:42:48,357
Fill them with water and keep
them on the boil, all right?

514
00:42:50,944 --> 00:42:53,654
Terry, set
the kettle on.

515
00:42:53,738 --> 00:42:55,072
We'll all do
with a brew.

516
00:43:02,872 --> 00:43:06,083
Terry, give us
a hand with this.

517
00:43:09,796 --> 00:43:11,213
To the side.

518
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:12,714
You fool.

519
00:43:12,799 --> 00:43:14,758
You came here because
of them, right?

520
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:18,011
I don't have a clue what they are,
and right now I don't really care.

521
00:43:18,096 --> 00:43:20,013
What are you
doing here?

522
00:43:20,098 --> 00:43:23,517
This was supposed to be a routine
training exercise, and that's all.

523
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:26,937
So this wasn't a rescue
mission? No, I guess not.

524
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:30,524
Back door is secure.

525
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:32,359
What's happening
here, Spoon?

526
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:35,862
They're still moving around out
there. They're keeping their distance.

527
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:37,906
Maybe they've had
enough for one night.

528
00:43:37,991 --> 00:43:41,535
Not likely. They're smart.
You've seen what they can do.

529
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:45,247
My guess is they're doing exactly
what you'd be doing in their shoes.

530
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:48,208
Working as a team. Looking
for a weakness. A way in.

531
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:52,087
I'm not about to second-guess these things.
They're the enemy. As simple as that.

532
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:54,673
This is no
ordinary enemy.

533
00:44:16,821 --> 00:44:20,532
You know what this reminds
me of? Rorke's Drift.

534
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:22,242
A hundred men
of Harlech

535
00:44:22,327 --> 00:44:25,912
making a desperate stand against
ten thousand Zulu warriors.

536
00:44:25,997 --> 00:44:28,623
Outnumbered,
surrounded.

537
00:44:28,708 --> 00:44:32,919
Staring death in the face.
No flinching for a moment.

538
00:44:33,004 --> 00:44:35,297
Balls of British steel.

539
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:39,259
You're bloody
loving this, aren't you?

540
00:44:39,344 --> 00:44:41,178
It's totally bone.

541
00:44:41,262 --> 00:44:43,180
That's all there
is to say.

542
00:44:53,983 --> 00:44:55,776
What are we talking
about here? Wolves?

543
00:44:55,860 --> 00:45:00,489
Not entirely wolf, nor human,
but something in between.

544
00:45:00,573 --> 00:45:03,909
Wolf men?
And a laugh, right?

545
00:45:03,993 --> 00:45:05,952
I may be nuts
but I'm no fruitcake.

546
00:45:06,037 --> 00:45:09,122
Fine. Stay here
and drink tea.

547
00:45:09,207 --> 00:45:12,250
I thought you might be here
because of them. But I guess not.

548
00:45:12,335 --> 00:45:15,003
Just don't be
an asshole.

549
00:45:16,589 --> 00:45:19,216
I like your new
girlfriend, Coop.

550
00:45:20,385 --> 00:45:21,843
How're you feeling?

551
00:45:21,928 --> 00:45:25,138
A touch of gas.

552
00:45:25,223 --> 00:45:29,518
And the fact the various body parts
are trying to evacuate the premises.

553
00:45:29,602 --> 00:45:31,895
Fucking awful.

554
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:37,234
Ta.

555
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:39,361
Cheers.

556
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:42,864
Attention!

557
00:45:46,411 --> 00:45:48,578
For crying out
loud, man.

558
00:45:48,663 --> 00:45:51,790
Short, controlled bursts.

559
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:56,670
Do you have
a name, soldier?

560
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:58,296
Cooper.

561
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:01,174
Gonna need your
help here, miss.

562
00:46:01,259 --> 00:46:02,592
My name is Megan.

563
00:46:02,677 --> 00:46:04,511
And I know
how to kill-

564
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:09,099
Shit, Sarge, you're
leaking like a sieve.

565
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:11,518
I need you to get some
Superglue and some whiskey.

566
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:12,936
I'll see what
I can do.

567
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:14,771
Come on.

568
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:18,442
I'm sorry about the asshole thing.
I've got a mean streak of mine across.

569
00:46:18,526 --> 00:46:21,361
It's all right. It's the
least of my worries right now.

570
00:46:21,446 --> 00:46:24,197
Can you pass me
my gun, please?

571
00:46:24,282 --> 00:46:26,116
Thank you.

572
00:46:27,285 --> 00:46:30,287
Come on, Coop.
Up the wooden hill.

573
00:46:30,371 --> 00:46:31,913
Where are we
going, Coop?

574
00:46:31,998 --> 00:46:34,416
You don't want
to know, mate.

575
00:47:00,401 --> 00:47:02,277
What's the glue for?

576
00:47:02,403 --> 00:47:07,115
Never wondered why the best thing that
Superglue sticks together is your fingers?

577
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,700
Give it. Give it.

578
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:11,203
Forget your grandma's
China cups.

579
00:47:11,287 --> 00:47:15,332
This stuff was developed for the
Vietnam war to patch up broken soldiers.

580
00:47:17,418 --> 00:47:19,169
How are you
feeling, Sarge?

581
00:47:20,505 --> 00:47:23,423
Absolutely fucking top,
fucking bollocks.

582
00:47:23,508 --> 00:47:25,342
Give us.
Give, give, give.

583
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:31,723
Are you sure he should be
taking painkillers with whiskey?

584
00:47:31,807 --> 00:47:33,517
He's earned it.

585
00:47:33,601 --> 00:47:35,185
Is it your
birthday, Coop?

586
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:36,269
No, mate.

587
00:47:36,354 --> 00:47:38,438
Is it my birthday? Hey!

588
00:47:38,523 --> 00:47:40,774
No. You're gonna thank us
for this in the morning.

589
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:43,318
I'll tell you something.
I'm gonna fucking thank you.

590
00:47:43,444 --> 00:47:48,782
Right now I'm gonna thank you because you
saved my life. You got me out of there.

591
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:50,617
You would've done
the same.

592
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:55,163
If I'd done the same fucking thing,
I would've saved Bruce, wouldn't I?

593
00:47:55,248 --> 00:47:57,958
Yeah! Fuck!

594
00:48:07,677 --> 00:48:09,719
Fuck.

595
00:48:13,558 --> 00:48:15,350
Jesus!

596
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:19,563
Sausages.

597
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:22,983
I'll tell you
something, miss.

598
00:48:23,067 --> 00:48:26,486
This guy here
is my best mate.

599
00:48:26,571 --> 00:48:29,072
He's the salt of
the fucking Earth.

600
00:48:29,198 --> 00:48:32,867
Don't get me wrong. The rest of the
guys in the squad are lovely fellows.

601
00:48:32,952 --> 00:48:34,953
Anyone of them
could marry my-

602
00:48:36,872 --> 00:48:40,834
marry my sister
if I had one.

603
00:48:45,256 --> 00:48:48,300
I'll tell you what.
I love him I love you.

604
00:48:48,384 --> 00:48:50,635
Like the mate
that I, that I love.

605
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,596
Would you like
to be alone?

606
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:00,020
You fucker!

607
00:49:01,147 --> 00:49:03,023
Here.

608
00:49:03,107 --> 00:49:04,441
It's the adrenaline.

609
00:49:04,525 --> 00:49:06,359
I'll stick
and you bond.

610
00:49:06,444 --> 00:49:09,487
I'll tell you something.
Something better get fucking stuck

611
00:49:09,572 --> 00:49:11,823
'cause this is really
starting to hurt.

612
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:13,992
Cooper.

613
00:49:15,703 --> 00:49:17,912
Knock me out.
Hit me!

614
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:21,583
You fucking
pussy. Hit me!

615
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:47,484
How long have you
lived around here?

616
00:49:47,568 --> 00:49:50,820
Two years. Came here
for the wildlife.

617
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:53,823
I'm a zoologist.

618
00:49:53,908 --> 00:49:55,909
So you've heard those
stories as well then.

619
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:59,412
Yeah. I heard the stories. I
went looking. I found evidence.

620
00:49:59,497 --> 00:50:01,414
I was fascinated
by the possibility-

621
00:50:01,499 --> 00:50:04,000
You can't seriously
believe in werewolves.

622
00:50:04,085 --> 00:50:07,379
Straight out of college, I'd have
loved to the suggestion, but now

623
00:50:07,463 --> 00:50:10,298
I know they are
as real as you and me.

624
00:50:10,383 --> 00:50:12,842
Before tonight is over, you will, too.

625
00:50:16,055 --> 00:50:17,681
There.

626
00:50:17,765 --> 00:50:20,016
I think that'll hold.

627
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:22,644
You've done this before?

628
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:26,147
Oh, yeah. We glue people's guts
together all the time out here.

629
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:36,116
Everyone tooled up?

630
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:38,368
To the nines.

631
00:50:42,206 --> 00:50:44,874
Keep a fucking eye
over that one.

632
00:50:44,959 --> 00:50:47,836
Right, Terry,
you look sharp.

633
00:50:48,713 --> 00:50:50,714
The rest of you.

634
00:50:50,798 --> 00:50:54,509
We know things are going from shit
to bone to worse in the last 24 hours.

635
00:50:54,593 --> 00:50:58,638
But if we pull our way and do the
job, we still have a fighting chance.

636
00:50:58,723 --> 00:51:03,143
No more running. We
stand here. We fight.

637
00:51:03,227 --> 00:51:06,146
Right?
Any questions?

638
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:09,858
Just one, Coop. Exactly, what
is it we're fighting against?

639
00:51:09,942 --> 00:51:12,277
Megan, you wanna
run it pass the boys?

640
00:51:12,361 --> 00:51:14,404
Lycanthropes.

641
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:17,073
That's werewolves
to you and me.

642
00:51:18,451 --> 00:51:19,993
Are you taking a piss?

643
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:21,786
Makes perfect
sense to me.

644
00:51:21,871 --> 00:51:24,831
Full moons, silver bullets and
eyebrows that join in the middle?

645
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:28,334
Before you dismiss it off hand, think
about what you've seen and heard.

646
00:51:28,419 --> 00:51:31,588
The full moon, the teeth,
the claws, the howling.

647
00:51:31,672 --> 00:51:34,507
Is it so difficult
to believe?

648
00:51:34,592 --> 00:51:37,218
For a whole year now
I've tracked these things.

649
00:51:37,303 --> 00:51:39,929
I've studied them.
Try to understand them.

650
00:51:40,014 --> 00:51:44,058
Every month when the moon
is full, they hunt as a team

651
00:51:44,143 --> 00:51:46,144
dedicated to the kill.

652
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:49,272
During that time at least
15 people have vanished.

653
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:52,317
Hikers mostly, in small groups or alone.

654
00:51:52,443 --> 00:51:57,947
They're caught out in the open,
hunted down, torn apart, and devoured.

655
00:51:58,032 --> 00:52:01,075
I've never witnessed the actual
slaughter, but the next day

656
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:04,037
no bodies,
no werewolves.

657
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:06,164
Just blood.

658
00:52:06,248 --> 00:52:10,418
The eyebrows thing is nonsense.
It's just Dark Age paranoia.

659
00:52:10,503 --> 00:52:14,547
And silver bullets, no one's
ever got close enough to try.

660
00:52:14,632 --> 00:52:16,132
I'm sold.

661
00:52:16,217 --> 00:52:18,092
Slow down, Spoon.
Megan might have a point.

662
00:52:18,219 --> 00:52:21,721
I'm still not convinced that these things
didn't escape from the local nuthouse

663
00:52:21,806 --> 00:52:25,642
and forget to shave or trim their nails.
But they're out there and we're in here.

664
00:52:25,768 --> 00:52:29,896
What they may or may not be does not
affect our immediate situation one bit.

665
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:33,107
This is bone. This is so fucking bone!

666
00:52:33,192 --> 00:52:34,609
Anything else?

667
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:36,653
Yeah. What
does "bone" mean?

668
00:52:36,737 --> 00:52:37,904
Bone. Bollocks.

669
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:39,280
Not very good.

670
00:52:39,365 --> 00:52:41,991
Right. Anything else
I should know?

671
00:52:44,203 --> 00:52:46,246
Call signs.
You need to be specific.

672
00:52:46,372 --> 00:52:49,999
Upstairs you've got Sergeant Wells,
who you seem to know inside and out.

673
00:52:50,084 --> 00:52:53,670
You got Spoon over there.
The vomiting cavalier, Terry.

674
00:52:53,754 --> 00:52:55,755
The big guy
with the ax is Joe.

675
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:58,716
Didn't you
forget someone?

676
00:52:59,844 --> 00:53:01,594
Ryan.

677
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:04,472
Captain Ryan is not
one of our team.

678
00:53:05,683 --> 00:53:09,435
His being here
is hazy at best.

679
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:12,021
If I could tell
you, I would.

680
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:17,277
But I'm just a
soldier like you.

681
00:53:17,361 --> 00:53:20,947
No stripes.
No insignia.

682
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:25,827
A suit and a uniform does not make
a soldier. He's with Special Ops.

683
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:29,330
His team were wiped out last
night. He was the only survivor.

684
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:33,459
I'd advise you against pursuing the
line of questioning, Private Cooper.

685
00:53:33,544 --> 00:53:35,628
You're pulling rank
on me now, Captain.

686
00:53:35,713 --> 00:53:37,714
You can shove that
right up your arse.

687
00:53:37,798 --> 00:53:41,759
I'm saying my being
here is a moot point

688
00:53:41,844 --> 00:53:44,637
since I'm now in as
much shit as you are.

689
00:53:44,722 --> 00:53:48,349
We're on the same fucking
shit. And we need each other.

690
00:53:48,434 --> 00:53:50,143
I doubt
I need you.

691
00:53:50,227 --> 00:53:52,937
You bloody did
two hours ago.

692
00:53:53,022 --> 00:53:54,272
The Uaths.

693
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:55,648
Crying like
a baby you were.

694
00:53:55,733 --> 00:53:58,192
That was then.
Circumstances change.

695
00:53:58,277 --> 00:53:59,944
What?

696
00:54:00,029 --> 00:54:04,908
Uath is Celtic. The family's
lived in this glen for centuries.

697
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,994
So, what was he
doing out there?

698
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:10,163
I have an idea.

699
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:13,666
I wanna hear it
from the horse's mouth.

700
00:54:13,751 --> 00:54:15,335
Think of it Ryan.
How are you feeling?

701
00:54:15,419 --> 00:54:17,128
I'm fine.

702
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:20,632
When we found you, you could barely
open your eyes, let alone walk.

703
00:54:20,716 --> 00:54:24,010
And then later you manage
to run. And now look at you.

704
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:26,137
Fine and fit
and sitting pretty.

705
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:31,225
Hardly the behavior of a man who until
recently was knocking on death's door.

706
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:33,311
I have a strong
constitution.

707
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:35,355
You bloody kidding.

708
00:54:35,439 --> 00:54:38,149
You won't mind if I have a
look at that wound of yours.

709
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:40,234
I just assumed
you didn't.

710
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:42,362
I have a responsibility
to my patient.

711
00:54:42,446 --> 00:54:44,447
I'm warning you, Cooper,
don't touch me.

712
00:54:44,531 --> 00:54:46,616
Get back!

713
00:55:02,633 --> 00:55:05,134
Tie him up.
I want him to talk.

714
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:09,639
What are you gonna do?
Torture him?

715
00:55:09,723 --> 00:55:10,807
I don't know.

716
00:55:10,891 --> 00:55:12,392
What would you do?

717
00:55:12,476 --> 00:55:13,977
I'd torture him.

718
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:19,565
What now?

719
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:21,067
They shut down
the generator.

720
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:22,485
Why would
they do that?

721
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:24,028
Because they can
see in the dark.

722
00:55:24,113 --> 00:55:25,613
And you're all
afraid of it.

723
00:55:25,698 --> 00:55:27,198
This is a pile
of rancid shit!

724
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:28,992
Now what do you believe?

725
00:55:29,118 --> 00:55:32,620
I'm beginning to believe you. I
think Joe might've worded it better.

726
00:55:32,705 --> 00:55:34,622
They're on the move.

727
00:55:34,707 --> 00:55:37,291
All right.
This is it.

728
00:55:37,376 --> 00:55:40,086
Mark your targets
and preserve your ammo.

729
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:42,672
Three-round busts.

730
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:44,716
We only got one
stun grenade apiece.

731
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:48,094
So only use them
if absolutely necessary.

732
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:53,725
Stand to.

733
00:55:56,687 --> 00:55:57,770
What can I do?

734
00:55:57,855 --> 00:55:58,980
What do you
want to do?

735
00:55:59,064 --> 00:56:00,857
Run and hide.
I know what's coming.

736
00:56:00,941 --> 00:56:03,609
Take care of Sam.
Keep an eye on Ryan.

737
00:56:03,694 --> 00:56:05,945
If he tries
anything, pan him.

738
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:09,407
Chasing that first
kiss, are we, Cooper?

739
00:56:11,744 --> 00:56:14,037
It's as simple as this.

740
00:56:14,121 --> 00:56:18,291
You're not there for us,
we're not here for you.

741
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:15,181
Contact!

742
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:20,603
Die!

743
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:56,472
Spoon, get down.

744
00:58:16,618 --> 00:58:17,994
Fuck!

745
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:26,419
Fire in the hole!

746
00:58:28,589 --> 00:58:30,089
Ah!

747
00:59:29,066 --> 00:59:30,233
Cooper!

748
00:59:32,236 --> 00:59:34,403
Hurry!

749
00:59:45,624 --> 00:59:47,250
Cheers, mate.

750
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:53,589
The Sarge.

751
01:00:01,098 --> 01:00:02,765
Cooper.

752
01:00:06,937 --> 01:00:09,605
Sarge?
Sarge!

753
01:00:22,828 --> 01:00:27,373
Sarge? Sarge, wake up.
Wake up, you fuck.

754
01:00:29,293 --> 01:00:31,127
Sarge!

755
01:00:32,504 --> 01:00:34,755
You fucker.
Wake up.

756
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:41,304
Sarge!

757
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:45,725
Fuck off!

758
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:27,892
Dogs.

759
01:01:27,976 --> 01:01:29,852
More like pussies.

760
01:01:52,376 --> 01:01:53,459
You all right?

761
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:56,796
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I'm peachy, mate.

762
01:01:58,256 --> 01:01:59,965
Coop.

763
01:02:05,013 --> 01:02:07,556
The squad's yours, mate.

764
01:02:32,416 --> 01:02:33,707
They took Terry.

765
01:02:36,378 --> 01:02:38,212
Then we go
and get him back.

766
01:02:38,296 --> 01:02:39,839
You're right.

767
01:02:39,923 --> 01:02:42,091
Forget about him.

768
01:02:48,557 --> 01:02:50,683
What did you say?

769
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:53,269
He's dead, Cooper,
and you know it.

770
01:02:56,606 --> 01:02:58,649
Shit!

771
01:03:08,577 --> 01:03:10,911
Somebody must've heard
some gunfire.

772
01:03:10,996 --> 01:03:12,997
Somebody must've
heard something.

773
01:03:13,123 --> 01:03:17,209
Who? The only other house within 50
miles of here is mine, and I'm not there.

774
01:03:17,294 --> 01:03:19,879
What about the road,
passers by?

775
01:03:19,963 --> 01:03:23,382
Do you have any idea what kind of
luck you had running into me tonight?

776
01:03:23,467 --> 01:03:26,218
I thought you
ran into us.

777
01:03:26,303 --> 01:03:28,471
Joe, check upstairs.

778
01:03:32,225 --> 01:03:37,438
Even if anyone did come by, they'd
only end up with a slaughter like you.

779
01:03:37,522 --> 01:03:39,648
Our really hope
is daylight.

780
01:03:39,733 --> 01:03:42,318
Sunrise is
in six hours.

781
01:03:42,402 --> 01:03:44,695
We did the best
we could.

782
01:03:44,779 --> 01:03:49,783
But if the Sarge's condition
deteriorates, he'll have less than four.

783
01:03:49,910 --> 01:03:54,371
And the only thing holding them back, is they
don't know how much ammunition we have left.

784
01:04:04,049 --> 01:04:05,841
Let's give it a look.

785
01:04:07,219 --> 01:04:09,887
Tell me, honestly,

786
01:04:09,971 --> 01:04:11,764
what are our chances?

787
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:15,267
The morale seems
good, considering.

788
01:04:15,352 --> 01:04:19,355
It'll only last as long
as the ammunition holds it.

789
01:04:19,439 --> 01:04:22,274
High spirits it's no substitute
for 800 rounds a minute,

790
01:04:22,359 --> 01:04:24,985
but I don't think that's
what you want to hear.

791
01:04:26,363 --> 01:04:28,489
Think about it, Cooper.

792
01:04:28,573 --> 01:04:32,826
Up until today you believed there
was a line between myth and reality.

793
01:04:32,911 --> 01:04:37,873
A very fine line sometimes,
but at least it was a line.

794
01:04:39,042 --> 01:04:41,168
Those things out
there are real.

795
01:04:43,421 --> 01:04:45,881
If they're real,
what else is real?

796
01:04:47,551 --> 01:04:50,970
You know what lives
in the shadows now.

797
01:04:51,054 --> 01:04:54,306
You may never get another
night sleep as long as you live.

798
01:04:54,391 --> 01:04:57,810
So why worry, Cooper? You
may not live that long.

799
01:04:57,894 --> 01:04:59,979
Shut your mouth.

800
01:05:01,606 --> 01:05:04,316
I'm gonna make it through
this. You know why?

801
01:05:04,401 --> 01:05:06,318
I don't scare
that easy.

802
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:12,408
Here.

803
01:05:13,618 --> 01:05:15,160
It's supposed
to be lucky.

804
01:05:15,245 --> 01:05:17,288
For me or the rest
of the rabbit?

805
01:05:17,372 --> 01:05:19,498
You'll need a lot more
than luck this time.

806
01:05:19,583 --> 01:05:21,875
Shut up, Ryan.

807
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:23,877
Listen to me, Cooper.
Ignore him.

808
01:05:24,004 --> 01:05:27,756
We can survive 'til sunrise. That's all
that matters. It's just a few more hours.

809
01:05:27,841 --> 01:05:30,593
Wait a minute. Am I
missing something here?

810
01:05:34,973 --> 01:05:37,766
I know him.

811
01:05:37,851 --> 01:05:41,228
I was seconded to his team
during their first visit here.

812
01:05:41,313 --> 01:05:44,773
First visit? What first visit?
What the fuck are you talking about?

813
01:05:44,858 --> 01:05:47,943
They came to check out the
stories. They needed an expert.

814
01:05:48,028 --> 01:05:52,531
It's just a few more hours,
Cooper. That's all there is.

815
01:05:52,616 --> 01:05:54,199
All clear?

816
01:05:54,284 --> 01:05:55,534
Yeah.

817
01:05:55,619 --> 01:05:57,244
You wanna
kill them all?

818
01:05:57,329 --> 01:05:58,537
Yes.

819
01:05:58,622 --> 01:06:00,205
Good. Keep it up.

820
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:02,583
What's the damage, Spoon?

821
01:06:02,667 --> 01:06:04,710
We might've pissed
on our chips.

822
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:06,754
We've only got two full
mags for the MP5,

823
01:06:06,838 --> 01:06:11,508
six rounds for the shotgun,
and one spare. Just in case.

824
01:06:12,636 --> 01:06:14,637
Stay sharp, everyone.

825
01:07:08,066 --> 01:07:10,192
We're putting fire
down all over.

826
01:07:10,276 --> 01:07:14,196
We fill those things with lead, and
they just kept coming back at us.

827
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:16,990
Sixty rounds won't
last two minutes.

828
01:07:17,075 --> 01:07:19,618
So, either we all
fight our way clear,

829
01:07:19,744 --> 01:07:23,080
or the rest of us keep them
occupied but one of us goes for help.

830
01:07:23,206 --> 01:07:28,669
By the time the cavalry get here, they'll
have what's left of us between their teeth.

831
01:07:40,223 --> 01:07:42,975
Fucking brilliant.

832
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:46,562
We either stay and
snuff it, or we all go.

833
01:07:46,646 --> 01:07:48,021
And snuff it.

834
01:07:48,106 --> 01:07:50,733
Decisions, decisions.

835
01:07:50,817 --> 01:07:52,484
Laugh.

836
01:07:52,569 --> 01:07:54,153
I nearly died.

837
01:07:54,237 --> 01:07:55,404
Who stopped you?

838
01:07:55,488 --> 01:07:57,448
That's it! We'll
fucking have him!

839
01:07:57,532 --> 01:08:00,409
Take it easy, big man.
Calm down.

840
01:08:00,493 --> 01:08:03,245
Do any of you know
how to hot-wire a car?

841
01:08:03,329 --> 01:08:05,289
They keep an old
Land Rover in the barn.

842
01:08:05,415 --> 01:08:09,084
I don't know where the keys are, but if
one of you could break in and start it.

843
01:08:09,169 --> 01:08:12,087
I can do that.

844
01:08:12,172 --> 01:08:13,255
Are you sure?

845
01:08:13,339 --> 01:08:15,174
A piece of piss.

846
01:08:15,258 --> 01:08:19,344
The further I am from this
wanker, the happier I'll be.

847
01:08:19,429 --> 01:08:22,973
All right. You're
gonna need a decoy.

848
01:08:23,057 --> 01:08:25,434
Something fast
and loud.

849
01:08:32,275 --> 01:08:35,527
What?
You what?

850
01:08:40,742 --> 01:08:44,244
You, sit.
Stay.

851
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:55,881
You're serious about this
werewolf thing, aren't you?

852
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:57,883
Afraid so.

853
01:08:57,967 --> 01:08:59,468
Shit.

854
01:09:00,804 --> 01:09:02,888
Don't suppose you know
who won the match.

855
01:09:02,972 --> 01:09:04,807
Didn't even know
there was a game on.

856
01:09:04,891 --> 01:09:06,558
It's not a game.

857
01:09:06,643 --> 01:09:09,853
All right, this is it.
Everyone get ready.

858
01:09:09,938 --> 01:09:11,605
Bollocks.

859
01:09:18,947 --> 01:09:22,825
Joe. Good luck, man.

860
01:09:22,909 --> 01:09:25,953
You don't get off
the hook that easy.

861
01:09:58,736 --> 01:10:01,655
All right, you bastards.

862
01:10:04,284 --> 01:10:09,204
Come on and have a go if you
think you're naughty enough.

863
01:10:20,425 --> 01:10:23,343
Come on, you beauties!

864
01:10:28,892 --> 01:10:30,767
They took the bait.

865
01:10:36,232 --> 01:10:38,817
Come on!

866
01:10:38,902 --> 01:10:40,152
Spoon, run!

867
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:56,752
Move your fucking
arse, soldier.

868
01:10:57,754 --> 01:10:59,171
Come on.

869
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:01,173
I'm trying.

870
01:11:10,975 --> 01:11:13,936
I love it when a
posh bear talks dirty.

871
01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:22,027
Jesus! What's fucking
going on, Cooper?

872
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:30,786
Cut it.

873
01:12:02,986 --> 01:12:05,070
Fuck this.

874
01:12:06,322 --> 01:12:07,406
Shit.

875
01:12:20,712 --> 01:12:25,340
He's done it. Ryan, up. Everyone
else downstairs. Come on, move it.

876
01:12:26,592 --> 01:12:28,176
Move. Move.

877
01:12:37,854 --> 01:12:40,063
You're behind
me, aren't you?

878
01:12:45,445 --> 01:12:47,946
I'm gonna
fucking have you!

879
01:13:00,376 --> 01:13:03,211
Right? Go. Go.

880
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:45,165
Well?

881
01:15:45,249 --> 01:15:47,792
She's in a bad way.
A few pumps gone.

882
01:15:47,877 --> 01:15:51,129
Fan belt is bugging.
She's pissing out petrol.

883
01:15:51,214 --> 01:15:53,381
The word "bone"
springs to mind.

884
01:15:54,508 --> 01:15:56,426
Joe's body?

885
01:15:56,510 --> 01:15:58,553
It's gone.

886
01:16:03,059 --> 01:16:04,893
What's the damage, Spoon?

887
01:16:04,977 --> 01:16:07,395
We're down
to 48 rounds.

888
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:09,314
Check the right.

889
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:14,069
Well, Ryan,
you heard the score.

890
01:16:14,153 --> 01:16:16,988
Maybe one or two of us are
gonna make it through this.

891
01:16:17,073 --> 01:16:19,658
I don't care much
for our chances.

892
01:16:19,742 --> 01:16:21,326
Do you like football?

893
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:26,706
What? They think it's all over
and all that crap? No, I don't.

894
01:16:26,791 --> 01:16:31,503
Don't you remember Joe? He liked
football. Fucking lived for it.

895
01:16:31,587 --> 01:16:33,421
Is this relevant?

896
01:16:33,547 --> 01:16:37,092
He missed the most important match of
his life for this bullshit exercise.

897
01:16:37,176 --> 01:16:40,762
And now he's dead along with two other
mates. I'd give them my right arm.

898
01:16:40,846 --> 01:16:43,265
To fucking right
it's relevant!

899
01:16:43,349 --> 01:16:45,767
You just can't get
pass the dog, can you?

900
01:16:45,851 --> 01:16:48,645
We're losing, Ryan.
We're three now down,

901
01:16:48,729 --> 01:16:52,440
and we're close to the final whistle.
At the very least I wanna even score.

902
01:16:55,444 --> 01:16:57,696
I understand
your resentment.

903
01:16:57,780 --> 01:17:03,368
But you failed because you weren't
prepared to take that extra step.

904
01:17:03,452 --> 01:17:06,079
If you'd passed, you
would've been on my team.

905
01:17:06,163 --> 01:17:08,540
And if you were on
my team, you'd be dead.

906
01:17:08,624 --> 01:17:12,585
Yeah, I failed.
I'm bloody glad of it.

907
01:17:12,670 --> 01:17:15,630
If I was given the choice of
taking orders from a twat like you

908
01:17:15,756 --> 01:17:19,092
and slogging it out at these guys,
I'll take the underdogs anytime.

909
01:17:19,176 --> 01:17:22,220
So you can take your precious
selection, shove it up your arse

910
01:17:22,305 --> 01:17:25,849
and stop trying to change
the fucking subject!

911
01:17:34,275 --> 01:17:36,401
Fair enough.

912
01:17:36,485 --> 01:17:39,112
But you won't like
what I have to tell you.

913
01:17:39,196 --> 01:17:42,407
There are some places
you really shouldn't go.

914
01:17:42,491 --> 01:17:45,201
We'll be the judge
of that, Ryan.

915
01:17:47,079 --> 01:17:51,166
Ever heard of Special
Weapons Division?

916
01:17:51,292 --> 01:17:55,253
They're the men in white coats who train
dolphins to stick mines on submarines.

917
01:17:55,338 --> 01:18:00,342
And cute furry animals to
tear your head off at the neck.

918
01:18:00,426 --> 01:18:03,178
They saw an opportunity
and called me in.

919
01:18:03,262 --> 01:18:05,680
To do what? Catch
one of these things?

920
01:18:05,765 --> 01:18:08,350
And to bring it back.
Alive if possible.

921
01:18:08,434 --> 01:18:11,102
Only "it" turned out
to be "them. "

922
01:18:11,187 --> 01:18:13,396
We underestimated
the enemy numbers.

923
01:18:13,522 --> 01:18:17,734
Underestimated? I would have a serious word
with your heads about their intelligence.

924
01:18:17,818 --> 01:18:20,445
It may have been their
invitation, but it was my party.

925
01:18:20,529 --> 01:18:22,447
I planned it
and executed it.

926
01:18:22,531 --> 01:18:24,574
And you loused it up.

927
01:18:26,535 --> 01:18:28,703
We lost good men, Ryan.

928
01:18:28,788 --> 01:18:31,373
Yours and mine.

929
01:18:34,543 --> 01:18:35,877
I wanna know

930
01:18:38,881 --> 01:18:40,632
where we fit in.

931
01:18:40,716 --> 01:18:44,177
The reality is
you're expendable.

932
01:18:44,261 --> 01:18:47,722
And I had approval
to put you at risk.

933
01:18:49,558 --> 01:18:53,144
Get to the fucking
point, Ryan.

934
01:18:54,647 --> 01:18:57,399
I made a gap
in enemy lines.

935
01:18:57,483 --> 01:19:02,320
You were good enough to spot it
and predictable enough to go for it.

936
01:19:02,405 --> 01:19:05,323
That was your bait.
You were mine.

937
01:19:10,579 --> 01:19:12,247
You bastard.

938
01:19:12,331 --> 01:19:15,917
I had to choose somebody.
I remembered you.

939
01:19:16,001 --> 01:19:18,420
Monkey see,
monkey do.

940
01:19:20,548 --> 01:19:22,257
They were my men!

941
01:19:22,383 --> 01:19:25,385
Get up, you shit. You know what we
can do. Give us a fighting chance.

942
01:19:25,469 --> 01:19:29,139
Live and learn, Cooper.

943
01:19:34,186 --> 01:19:36,938
I didn't hit him hard.

944
01:19:37,022 --> 01:19:39,190
You tricked
something lose.

945
01:20:13,893 --> 01:20:15,727
Bad dog.

946
01:20:20,733 --> 01:20:22,817
Fetch.

947
01:20:22,902 --> 01:20:24,319
Make the shot.

948
01:20:27,490 --> 01:20:29,157
Clear.

949
01:20:31,577 --> 01:20:34,829
Cooper, get down.
I got target.

950
01:20:56,852 --> 01:21:00,605
Werewolves spend most of their
time in human form, right?

951
01:21:00,689 --> 01:21:04,526
And the only people from
miles around live right here.

952
01:21:04,610 --> 01:21:07,779
So these things aren't about to
give up the fight and go home.

953
01:21:07,863 --> 01:21:09,155
They are home.

954
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:11,324
That makes perfect
sense, don't it?

955
01:21:11,408 --> 01:21:15,912
We bust into their house. We eat all
their porridge. We sleep in their beds.

956
01:21:15,996 --> 01:21:17,747
No wonder
they're pissed off.

957
01:21:17,831 --> 01:21:19,958
But they're good people.
They're kind people.

958
01:21:20,042 --> 01:21:21,125
More is the pity.

959
01:21:21,210 --> 01:21:22,335
Why?

960
01:21:22,419 --> 01:21:23,878
We're gonna have
to kill them all.

961
01:21:23,963 --> 01:21:25,964
He's right.

962
01:21:45,609 --> 01:21:49,487
What self-respecting werewolf would
have anything silver in a house anyway?

963
01:21:49,572 --> 01:21:51,906
Fuck the folklore.
Let's just burn them.

964
01:21:51,991 --> 01:21:53,199
If we knew
where to find them.

965
01:21:53,284 --> 01:21:54,867
Maybe we do.

966
01:21:54,994 --> 01:21:58,329
Everything we've seen so far
suggests the behavior of a pack.

967
01:21:58,414 --> 01:22:01,666
Six to eight members. An Alpha
pair leading the subordinates,

968
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:05,336
and a young male, the Beta wolf,
second in command. Makes sense.

969
01:22:05,421 --> 01:22:07,171
You lost me.

970
01:22:07,298 --> 01:22:11,342
A wolf pack sticks together, generally
somewhere close to its food supply.

971
01:22:11,427 --> 01:22:16,222
Somewhere safe,
sheltered, and warm.

972
01:22:20,477 --> 01:22:23,563
You're gonna have to move like
shit off the shovel on this one.

973
01:22:23,647 --> 01:22:25,440
You wanna get
your own shit.

974
01:22:25,566 --> 01:22:29,360
When we blow that fuse up, that place
is gonna look like Zabriskie Point.

975
01:22:29,445 --> 01:22:30,778
Yeah, it's easy peesy.

976
01:22:30,863 --> 01:22:32,488
My lime's squeezy.

977
01:22:32,573 --> 01:22:34,282
Listen, Coop.

978
01:22:36,994 --> 01:22:42,290
What about the Sarge?

979
01:22:42,374 --> 01:22:44,417
You know what I mean.

980
01:22:48,547 --> 01:22:50,423
The Sarge is with us.

981
01:22:50,507 --> 01:22:52,050
Yeah, yeah.

982
01:22:52,134 --> 01:22:55,261
I just didn't want him to go
out without his watch back.

983
01:23:04,229 --> 01:23:07,315
And you stay
out of trouble.

984
01:23:21,789 --> 01:23:23,665
You all right?

985
01:23:25,751 --> 01:23:29,712
Oh, yeah,
I am fine, Cooper.

986
01:23:29,797 --> 01:23:34,509
I mean, I feel
absolutely fantastic.

987
01:23:37,513 --> 01:23:39,597
That's a problem, isn't it?

988
01:23:39,682 --> 01:23:41,641
Hey?

989
01:23:45,437 --> 01:23:47,355
What if she's wrong?

990
01:23:49,024 --> 01:23:51,984
What if they're not
all in there?

991
01:23:52,069 --> 01:23:54,278
Then we'll get
some of them.

992
01:23:54,363 --> 01:23:56,614
It's a shit lot better
than none of them,

993
01:23:56,699 --> 01:23:58,866
and a marked improvement
on all of us.

994
01:23:58,951 --> 01:24:02,370
No, you listen to me.
You get the fuck out now.

995
01:24:02,454 --> 01:24:05,123
I'll hold them back, keep
them occupied. You get out.

996
01:24:06,709 --> 01:24:10,378
We've lost enough men for
one night, don't you think?

997
01:24:10,462 --> 01:24:12,505
Let me show you something.

998
01:24:15,968 --> 01:24:19,220
Do not tell me that
that is fucking normal.

999
01:24:22,891 --> 01:24:26,519
What happened to Ryan
is happening to me.

1000
01:24:26,603 --> 01:24:28,938
It's just a matter
of time, mate.

1001
01:24:29,022 --> 01:24:32,442
Stop wasting time
with this hara-kiri crap.

1002
01:24:32,526 --> 01:24:34,569
This fight isn't
lost, yet.

1003
01:24:34,653 --> 01:24:39,365
With Ryan it only took a
couple of hours. It's full moon.

1004
01:24:39,491 --> 01:24:42,827
Maybe it's like when you need to take
a piss or something. I don't know.

1005
01:24:42,911 --> 01:24:44,871
When you gotta go,
you gotta fucking go.

1006
01:24:44,955 --> 01:24:47,582
Maybe it's more than
needing a shite.

1007
01:24:47,708 --> 01:24:52,420
Just 'cause you need one, it doesn't
mean you drop your kegs and pinch one off.

1008
01:24:54,465 --> 01:24:58,509
Fucking Ryan, shifty bastard could've
been one of those things from the start.

1009
01:24:58,635 --> 01:25:02,430
You know, Coop, there's one more thing
you gotta learn about command, mate.

1010
01:25:05,726 --> 01:25:09,604
Sometimes the people that
you kill, are your own men.

1011
01:25:11,899 --> 01:25:14,317
So, I'm asking you.

1012
01:25:14,401 --> 01:25:16,527
Let me take care
of myself.

1013
01:25:18,947 --> 01:25:23,242
And at least spare you the unfortunate
business of trying to expla-

1014
01:25:23,327 --> 01:25:26,078
explain to Annie why
you had to incinerate me.

1015
01:25:26,163 --> 01:25:30,291
We're gonna knock seven colors of
shit out of these fuckers. We need you.

1016
01:25:30,375 --> 01:25:32,710
It's all right,
you know, mate.

1017
01:25:32,795 --> 01:25:34,462
It's okay.

1018
01:25:35,881 --> 01:25:39,133
I just didn't make it
out this time. That's all.

1019
01:25:40,427 --> 01:25:42,428
Because of the job,
you know what I mean?

1020
01:25:42,554 --> 01:25:46,891
When I signed my life away on that
doted line, I fucking meant it.

1021
01:25:46,975 --> 01:25:50,478
I am a professional soldier.

1022
01:25:58,028 --> 01:26:00,071
So, what do you
want me to do?

1023
01:26:03,742 --> 01:26:05,910
Roast their
bollocks off.

1024
01:26:08,163 --> 01:26:09,622
All clear.

1025
01:26:11,792 --> 01:26:13,167
Good luck.

1026
01:26:57,212 --> 01:26:58,880
Light it!

1027
01:27:00,757 --> 01:27:02,174
Shit.

1028
01:27:07,097 --> 01:27:08,848
Sarge.

1029
01:28:05,113 --> 01:28:07,239
I'm sorry.

1030
01:28:14,706 --> 01:28:16,666
When I found you
out there tonight,

1031
01:28:16,750 --> 01:28:20,795
I truly believed you were the
best chance I had of getting out.

1032
01:28:20,879 --> 01:28:23,381
But now we have
no chance.

1033
01:28:23,465 --> 01:28:26,050
There is no out.

1034
01:28:26,134 --> 01:28:28,219
There never was.

1035
01:28:30,138 --> 01:28:33,391
I came here to be one with
nature. Well, I got what I wanted.

1036
01:28:33,475 --> 01:28:36,268
Now I have
to live with it.

1037
01:28:39,690 --> 01:28:42,733
There is no house
in the next glen.

1038
01:28:42,818 --> 01:28:44,694
No.

1039
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:49,907
And there were no werewolves
in the barn when it blew.

1040
01:28:49,992 --> 01:28:52,159
Not one.

1041
01:28:54,538 --> 01:28:57,581
The reason you're not in the
photograph is 'cause you took it.

1042
01:28:57,666 --> 01:28:59,083
I never meant to-

1043
01:28:59,167 --> 01:29:01,961
You women.

1044
01:29:02,045 --> 01:29:04,130
Same old shite.

1045
01:29:04,214 --> 01:29:07,258
Being nice to women
will get you nowhere, Cooper.

1046
01:29:07,342 --> 01:29:10,636
Being nice to me
will get you killed.

1047
01:29:12,305 --> 01:29:14,807
You may think they're
all bitches, but

1048
01:29:16,309 --> 01:29:19,270
I'm the real thing.

1049
01:29:28,238 --> 01:29:31,365
Do you think I like being
part of this fucked up family?

1050
01:29:31,450 --> 01:29:34,285
Do you think I chose
to run with the pack?

1051
01:29:34,369 --> 01:29:35,786
No.

1052
01:29:35,871 --> 01:29:38,289
I chose you.

1053
01:29:38,373 --> 01:29:41,876
But now you're out of
luck, and I'm out of time.

1054
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:47,131
And all we can do is let
nature take its course.

1055
01:29:47,215 --> 01:29:51,093
They were always here.
I just unlocked the door.

1056
01:29:51,178 --> 01:29:53,554
It's that time
of the month.

1057
01:30:10,655 --> 01:30:12,823
Somebody has to put it
out of his misery.

1058
01:30:12,908 --> 01:30:14,909
Spoon. Clear.

1059
01:30:14,993 --> 01:30:17,328
Go now!

1060
01:30:17,412 --> 01:30:20,331
Spoonie, stop fucking.
It's an order!

1061
01:30:58,578 --> 01:30:59,912
Come on!

1062
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:13,092
Sarge?

1063
01:31:21,393 --> 01:31:22,977
Sarge?

1064
01:31:23,937 --> 01:31:26,230
I'm in the closet.

1065
01:31:27,190 --> 01:31:29,358
Open the closet.

1066
01:31:32,571 --> 01:31:34,738
Come on!

1067
01:32:22,871 --> 01:32:25,664
You fucking mother!

1068
01:32:41,431 --> 01:32:43,807
You're not killing me,
you bastard.

1069
01:32:43,892 --> 01:32:46,894
How do you like the
tomatoes, you fucking bastard?

1070
01:32:55,403 --> 01:32:58,113
Come on.

1071
01:32:58,198 --> 01:33:01,367
I'm running out, Coop.
I'm running out.

1072
01:33:11,127 --> 01:33:15,756
You're a fucking bastard.

1073
01:33:16,925 --> 01:33:19,093
Come on!
Come on!

1074
01:33:39,614 --> 01:33:43,158
I hope I give you the
shits, you fucking wimp.

1075
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:52,418
You fucker.

1076
01:33:52,502 --> 01:33:53,544
Come on, Coop.

1077
01:33:58,508 --> 01:34:01,635
Beat it!

1078
01:34:01,720 --> 01:34:03,137
Here.

1079
01:34:05,140 --> 01:34:06,557
Go away.

1080
01:34:19,571 --> 01:34:24,158
Go on, Coop! Get stuck in mate!
Get out of it! Come on, you fucker!

1081
01:34:24,242 --> 01:34:27,036
Go away, you
fucking ass.

1082
01:34:30,665 --> 01:34:32,458
Come on!

1083
01:35:18,546 --> 01:35:21,465
Cooper, let's get
in the wardrobe, son.

1084
01:35:21,549 --> 01:35:22,800
What?

1085
01:35:22,884 --> 01:35:24,259
Let's get
in the wardrobe.

1086
01:35:24,344 --> 01:35:25,719
All right.

1087
01:35:30,809 --> 01:35:32,684
What's that smell?

1088
01:35:32,769 --> 01:35:34,686
I don't know.

1089
01:35:39,275 --> 01:35:41,568
Fucking hell.

1090
01:35:43,947 --> 01:35:45,572
Give me that.

1091
01:35:48,368 --> 01:35:52,413
Open your mouth. Watch
the ears. Mind your toes.

1092
01:35:57,627 --> 01:35:59,253
Go.

1093
01:36:13,184 --> 01:36:15,394
Where's Spoon?

1094
01:36:19,149 --> 01:36:21,775
There is no Spoon.

1095
01:36:21,860 --> 01:36:23,819
No, you fucking bastards!

1096
01:36:23,903 --> 01:36:25,946
Help me, Cooper.

1097
01:36:45,133 --> 01:36:47,134
Get in there.
Get in there!

1098
01:36:50,972 --> 01:36:52,598
What are you doing?

1099
01:36:52,682 --> 01:36:57,311
Take this. There's one in
the chamber. I'm fucking bent.

1100
01:36:57,395 --> 01:36:59,480
We go together or
we don't fucking go.

1101
01:36:59,564 --> 01:37:03,317
It's my last order. Do not
fuck about. Do not disobey me.

1102
01:37:03,401 --> 01:37:05,402
Fuck! Listen.

1103
01:37:05,487 --> 01:37:07,613
You have got
to make it alive.

1104
01:37:07,697 --> 01:37:12,367
Prove what happened. Not
just for me or my lads.

1105
01:37:14,412 --> 01:37:16,079
For her!

1106
01:37:18,249 --> 01:37:20,167
Here.

1107
01:37:21,503 --> 01:37:23,629
Prove it happened, mate.

1108
01:37:23,713 --> 01:37:25,881
Go! Go!

1109
01:39:53,905 --> 01:39:56,406
Sam. Fuck.

1110
01:39:59,994 --> 01:40:01,662
What the fuck?

1111
01:40:13,383 --> 01:40:16,677
Ryan, have you tried
licking your own balls, yet?

1112
01:40:20,556 --> 01:40:23,016
I forgot. You don't
fucking have any.

1113
01:40:33,027 --> 01:40:34,194
Ha!

1114
01:41:19,073 --> 01:41:23,073
You think it's all over? It is now.

1115
01:41:24,073 --> 01:41:34,073
