555
00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:48,044
Chas?

556
00:02:57,126 --> 00:02:58,787
Breakfast?

557
00:03:10,006 --> 00:03:11,667
You're up.

558
00:03:11,908 --> 00:03:13,341
Yeah.

559
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:23,012
You're gonna be late for work, Dana.

560
00:03:24,387 --> 00:03:26,855
Cornflakes or Rice Krispies?

561
00:03:27,023 --> 00:03:29,082
It's all right. I'll get my own.

562
00:03:34,831 --> 00:03:37,265
Confirmed bachelor, aren't you?

563
00:03:38,067 --> 00:03:39,591
A fella last night in the club...

564
00:03:39,769 --> 00:03:42,636
...said that my voice
was wasted on cabaret material.

565
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:43,794
Oh, yeah?

566
00:03:47,677 --> 00:03:49,167
Shall I come over tonight?

567
00:03:49,345 --> 00:03:52,041
I'll call you at the club about 2.

568
00:03:52,382 --> 00:03:53,713
Half past.

569
00:03:55,785 --> 00:03:59,084
- Two?
- Two, or half past.

570
00:04:09,098 --> 00:04:10,690
Morning, Rose.

571
00:04:32,155 --> 00:04:36,057
It's 8:00 in the evening, right?
The kiddies are still viewing, ain't they?

572
00:04:36,225 --> 00:04:38,386
You bastard foreign female.

573
00:04:38,561 --> 00:04:40,927
I mean, there's claret
all over the screen.

574
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:44,197
- Jesus got half his ear hanging off.
- Disgusting.

575
00:04:44,767 --> 00:04:46,792
I mean, how are the kids
gonna grow up?

576
00:04:47,236 --> 00:04:48,965
- It's not right.
- Definitely not.

577
00:04:49,238 --> 00:04:52,639
- Where to, Chas?
- The minicab depot.

578
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,289
Put your tie on.

579
00:05:20,536 --> 00:05:22,026
<i>Gentlemen of the jury...</i>

580
00:05:22,205 --> 00:05:27,233
...I would solemnly suggest to you
that what are really on trial here today...

581
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,742
...are the ethics of a community.

582
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:33,814
Our national economy,
even our national survival...

583
00:05:33,983 --> 00:05:37,475
...devolves upon the consolidation,
by merger...

584
00:05:37,653 --> 00:05:41,054
...of the smaller and weaker
economic units...

585
00:05:41,224 --> 00:05:45,593
...with the larger and lustier pillars
of our commercial context.

586
00:05:46,496 --> 00:05:50,159
What did I tell you? What did I tell you?
Look at this pigsty.

587
00:05:52,368 --> 00:05:54,734
Correspondence not answered.

588
00:05:54,904 --> 00:05:57,031
- Aren't you with us?
- Hey...

589
00:05:57,206 --> 00:05:58,434
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

590
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,872
I want that pig, Pooley.

591
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:04,107
- Are you Pooley?
- Yes, I am.

592
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,407
You're a disgrace,
an incompetent disgrace.

593
00:06:06,582 --> 00:06:09,176
- You're not fit to run a...
- Business is business...

594
00:06:09,352 --> 00:06:11,786
...and progress is progress.

595
00:06:12,188 --> 00:06:13,985
- Where's your brother?
- At the pictures.

596
00:06:14,157 --> 00:06:16,216
- Answer yes or no.
- It's around the office.

597
00:06:16,392 --> 00:06:18,758
- Stretch your mind.
- Filth and disorder.

598
00:06:18,928 --> 00:06:22,694
You need help. Help and protection.
Well, we offered it, my governor, personally.

599
00:06:22,865 --> 00:06:25,197
You had an appointment.
He waited 15 minutes.

600
00:06:25,368 --> 00:06:27,393
- You slag, 15 minutes.
- He checked the letter.

601
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:30,471
You call this a service to the public?
Look at this equipment.

602
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,074
Not maintained, is it?

603
00:06:33,242 --> 00:06:35,642
You're a technician, Mr. Wilson.
Makes you weep, eh?

604
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:38,280
Yeah, makes me weep.

605
00:06:38,581 --> 00:06:39,980
- No, don't.
- It's obsolete.

606
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:44,578
It is alleged by the prosecution...

607
00:06:44,754 --> 00:06:47,154
...that the dividend of 15 percent...

608
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:50,588
...which was declared
on the non-voting B shares...

609
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,020
...was indeed fraudulently designed...

610
00:06:54,197 --> 00:06:57,997
...solely to expedite
this admittedly bold...

611
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:00,567
...but in no way unethical, merger.

612
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:05,063
I say, merger, gentlemen, not takeover.

613
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:07,270
Words still have meanings...

614
00:07:07,443 --> 00:07:09,604
...even in our days of the computer.

615
00:07:09,946 --> 00:07:11,538
The question is:

616
00:07:11,714 --> 00:07:15,275
Was my client a party to that fraud?

617
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:20,082
Innuendo is a method I despise.

618
00:07:20,256 --> 00:07:22,850
Therefore, I say bluntly...

619
00:07:23,126 --> 00:07:27,495
...that already, you have heard sufficient
to point to the responsibility...

620
00:07:27,663 --> 00:07:30,154
...and guilt of another party.

621
00:07:30,433 --> 00:07:32,298
<i>A guilty man, gentlemen...</i>

622
00:07:32,468 --> 00:07:35,801
<i>... whose identity I shall not shrink</i>
<i>from establishing...</i>

623
00:07:35,972 --> 00:07:39,703
<i>... in the course of my presentation</i>
<i>of the case for the defense.</i>

624
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,537
Hello, Chas.

625
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:45,477
You be there tomorrow
at Number 11 Monk Street.

626
00:07:45,648 --> 00:07:50,051
Five thirty on the dot.
Do you understand?

627
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:56,823
Well, son,
how was the clientele tonight?

628
00:07:56,993 --> 00:07:58,620
Spot on, Harry, no aggravation.

629
00:07:58,794 --> 00:08:01,126
What about this lawyer geezer?
Did you see him?

630
00:08:01,297 --> 00:08:03,629
That man, I submit, should be standing...

631
00:08:03,799 --> 00:08:06,563
...where my unfortunate client
now stands.

632
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:10,502
- I can rely on that, eh?
- It'll be straightened out in the morning.

633
00:08:10,673 --> 00:08:14,939
He's a nutcase. Like all artists.
But I can rely on him.

634
00:08:15,111 --> 00:08:18,046
- I know my...
- Business is business.

635
00:08:19,982 --> 00:08:22,507
And progress is progress.

636
00:08:22,852 --> 00:08:26,879
In the fluid state of business ethics,
pertaining today...

637
00:08:27,056 --> 00:08:31,425
...we must protect the inalienable right
of the smaller businessman...

638
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:35,121
...to be conjoined in commercial union...

639
00:08:41,571 --> 00:08:44,597
You want to turn off the electricity
and cut the gas...

640
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:46,435
You're worth it. Come on, Greasy.

641
00:08:46,842 --> 00:08:48,742
- Don't you understand?
- Eighty-five pounds.

642
00:08:48,911 --> 00:08:52,677
I've got the new furnace coming in.
I already had to pay it.

643
00:08:52,848 --> 00:08:55,112
Mr. Molloy, you bleeding me white.

644
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:57,718
- You're wasting my time.
- Why does it work?

645
00:08:58,221 --> 00:09:00,485
Would you like a drink?
You like it with ice or...?

646
00:09:00,656 --> 00:09:04,251
You stink. You stinking foreign parasite.

647
00:09:04,427 --> 00:09:06,725
Please, my customers.

648
00:09:11,834 --> 00:09:13,301
Theresa, please hold the door.

649
00:09:14,337 --> 00:09:18,103
You know, I don't think I'm gonna
let you stay in the film business.

650
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:25,408
British justice.

651
00:09:41,464 --> 00:09:43,125
Here, what the...?

652
00:09:44,066 --> 00:09:46,432
- All right, let's keep our hair on, eh?
- Why?

653
00:09:46,602 --> 00:09:48,399
- Mr. Fraser?
- Yes?

654
00:09:48,571 --> 00:09:50,562
I've got a message for you.

655
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,503
From an old pal.

656
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:57,169
An old pal and an old partner,
who wants you to know, number one...

657
00:09:57,346 --> 00:10:01,646
...that he's ever so upset
about all this aggravation you got.

658
00:10:01,817 --> 00:10:05,014
And number two, don't involve old pals.

659
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:07,178
Not even a little bit.

660
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:09,517
- You follow me, Mr...?
- If you're an emissary...

661
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:12,525
...from Mr. Harold Flowers,
it would be most improper for us...

662
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:13,787
Don't interrupt.

663
00:10:13,963 --> 00:10:16,090
And no subpoenas for old pals, old mate.

664
00:10:16,265 --> 00:10:18,756
And no snide insinuations
in court, neither.

665
00:10:18,934 --> 00:10:21,266
Look here.
I'm Mr. Fraser's counsel and I warn...

666
00:10:21,437 --> 00:10:23,962
I know that.
Now shut your hole, Mr. Counsel.

667
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,832
- What did you say?
- Do you follow me, Fraser?

668
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:29,477
- Hole.
- Now let's face it.

669
00:10:29,645 --> 00:10:31,010
They're gonna convict you.

670
00:10:31,447 --> 00:10:33,574
It's better to spend
five years of your life...

671
00:10:33,749 --> 00:10:35,046
...in a nice comfy nick...

672
00:10:35,651 --> 00:10:39,109
...than rest of your miserable
existence in a filthy wheelchair.

673
00:10:39,288 --> 00:10:41,984
- Are you threatening my client?
- You bet I am, poncey.

674
00:10:42,591 --> 00:10:44,320
Do you follow me, eh?

675
00:10:45,528 --> 00:10:47,018
Boy?

676
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:50,892
I do.

677
00:10:52,935 --> 00:10:55,529
- Yeah. Good.
- Now listen to me.

678
00:10:55,705 --> 00:10:58,299
I must insist you address
your remarks to me.

679
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:07,048
Address my remarks?

680
00:11:09,385 --> 00:11:11,319
Okey-dokey. Why not?

681
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:14,479
Mr. Butler, we got his address,
haven't we?

682
00:11:14,657 --> 00:11:18,093
Why not, Mr. Humphrey? If he insists.

683
00:11:26,235 --> 00:11:27,463
Best of luck, Mr. Fraser.

684
00:11:27,636 --> 00:11:29,729
You don't intimidate me...

685
00:11:29,905 --> 00:11:31,167
Nor my client.

686
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,934
- George.
- Fraser.

687
00:11:43,853 --> 00:11:46,117
- Morning.
- Morning.

688
00:11:54,063 --> 00:11:55,826
- Easy.
- Good morning, mate.

689
00:11:57,032 --> 00:11:59,432
A tasty finish.

690
00:11:59,602 --> 00:12:01,763
A man of taste.

691
00:12:02,338 --> 00:12:05,205
Looks after his property,
your owner, does he?

692
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:06,964
Does he?

693
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,769
We've only got a gallon and a half.

694
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:42,443
Better not waste it, eh?

695
00:12:42,611 --> 00:12:44,238
Well, next time.

696
00:12:48,751 --> 00:12:50,776
<i>The foreign secretary...</i>

697
00:13:12,908 --> 00:13:16,207
Hold up, pal,
you'll do yourself a mischief.

698
00:13:22,651 --> 00:13:23,913
This takes me back.

699
00:13:24,086 --> 00:13:26,418
Your old man was a barber,
wasn't he, Rosie?

700
00:13:26,589 --> 00:13:28,056
No.

701
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:31,216
- No, he wasn't.
- Shut your hole, Moody.

702
00:13:31,527 --> 00:13:34,826
- No soap on the gentleman's collar.
- Sorry, sir, it was an accident.

703
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:49,371
Hair today and gone tomorrow.

704
00:13:49,712 --> 00:13:52,203
I said shut your bloody hole!

705
00:13:52,548 --> 00:13:55,073
He's a right nut, he is. Isn't he?

706
00:14:06,795 --> 00:14:10,287
Now, I want you to mention
what's happened here to your owner.

707
00:14:10,633 --> 00:14:11,998
Tell him I'll be in touch.

708
00:14:12,167 --> 00:14:17,230
<i>In the Mississippi Delta,</i>
<i>an area of nearly 13,900 square miles...</i>

709
00:14:20,142 --> 00:14:21,769
Trend-setting, sir, or what?

710
00:14:33,722 --> 00:14:35,781
I can rely on him.

711
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,449
I can't say more than that, can I?

712
00:14:39,061 --> 00:14:40,392
Thanks, Harry.

713
00:14:43,566 --> 00:14:45,227
Fourteen thousand quid we offered.

714
00:14:45,534 --> 00:14:46,762
I call that equitable.

715
00:14:47,036 --> 00:14:50,028
Three grand a week that boy's grossing,
or I'm a communist.

716
00:14:50,205 --> 00:14:52,639
- What's this about?
- Gordon, what we got in that file?

717
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:57,302
Joey Maddocks, Licensed Betting Office,
469 Fulham Road, acquisition of.

718
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:59,144
Plus our letters, sir.

719
00:14:59,415 --> 00:15:01,440
Now, what's all this about
Joey Maddocks?

720
00:15:01,617 --> 00:15:04,279
- You steaming into that slag?
- Of course not.

721
00:15:04,787 --> 00:15:07,278
He's been invited to join...

722
00:15:07,456 --> 00:15:11,290
...our associated group of companies,
my son.

723
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:14,861
All he needs, Harry, is a little nudge.

724
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:17,897
I'll nudge him for you,
don't you worry about that, pal.

725
00:15:18,233 --> 00:15:20,133
We've been courteous.

726
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:23,304
Courteous and generous.

727
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:28,108
He's an old friend of Chas' .

728
00:15:28,277 --> 00:15:32,839
Good pals, they was.
Like that since they was kids.

729
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,915
Game boy, eh, Chas?

730
00:15:35,084 --> 00:15:36,312
And a blinding left hand.

731
00:15:36,485 --> 00:15:38,953
Bastard. Soon as he come
into the poxy business, he...

732
00:15:39,121 --> 00:15:43,820
- Now, now, calm down, Chas.
- Come on, Harry. You know I'm...

733
00:15:43,993 --> 00:15:46,359
He's a lying slag, he's a grass,
and you know it.

734
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:49,622
Come on, son,
Water under the bridge, that is.

735
00:15:49,798 --> 00:15:52,699
- You know what I mean, Harry.
- All right, all right.

736
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:54,995
Well, tomorrow he learns...

737
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:58,162
...what's true and what's not.

738
00:15:59,942 --> 00:16:03,002
Like small businesses
in this day and age...

739
00:16:03,245 --> 00:16:06,976
...he's against nature.
- Lovely, Harry, I'll learn him.

740
00:16:07,516 --> 00:16:11,179
No. Rosie's gonna handle
this part of nonsense.

741
00:16:11,353 --> 00:16:14,117
I want that shop redecorated
tomorrow night.

742
00:16:14,289 --> 00:16:16,655
- Get the Brown boys, they like a laugh.
- Mad Cyril?

743
00:16:16,825 --> 00:16:18,690
- Why not?
- What?

744
00:16:18,861 --> 00:16:21,193
- Pop in, pop out.
- Absolutely.

745
00:16:21,363 --> 00:16:22,990
You know what I mean? Be...

746
00:16:23,332 --> 00:16:25,527
- Placatory.
- Of course.

747
00:16:25,701 --> 00:16:28,966
- Hold on, Harry.
- I like that, Gordon. Turn that up.

748
00:16:30,005 --> 00:16:33,497
- You want him to stay on and manage...?
- Of course we do.

749
00:16:33,676 --> 00:16:36,144
His name stays over the door
if he wants.

750
00:16:36,512 --> 00:16:39,379
- Right under ours.
- Let me see to the ponce, Harry.

751
00:16:39,548 --> 00:16:41,914
I'll decorate him and his shop.

752
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,984
Don't you ever listen to a word I say?

753
00:16:44,153 --> 00:16:47,020
Keep personal relations out of business.

754
00:16:47,189 --> 00:16:48,417
- Excuse me, but...
- Out!

755
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:54,392
But your relations with Joey
was double-personal.

756
00:16:54,563 --> 00:16:56,053
Right?

757
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,529
Right then.
And what's my other thing I say?

758
00:16:58,701 --> 00:17:00,532
My motto?

759
00:17:02,538 --> 00:17:07,942
At the death, who is left
holding the sodding baby?

760
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,572
No, go on, what else?

761
00:17:15,417 --> 00:17:16,679
Harry Flowers.

762
00:17:16,885 --> 00:17:18,944
Right again.

763
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,951
Me.

764
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,114
Me.

765
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,056
Me.

766
00:17:30,733 --> 00:17:32,098
Me.

767
00:17:34,069 --> 00:17:36,333
All right. At ease, gentlemen.

768
00:17:36,505 --> 00:17:38,473
Anyone for a nightcap?

769
00:18:45,808 --> 00:18:47,605
- We need a signed statement.
- What for?

770
00:18:47,776 --> 00:18:50,472
Containing your allegations
against Mr. Flowers.

771
00:18:50,646 --> 00:18:52,876
- Allegations?
- Allegations.

772
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:56,040
Found it outside. Clean it.
Lots of filth around.

773
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,652
Yeah, cheers, Steve. Listen...

774
00:18:59,288 --> 00:19:03,452
I'm not making actual allegations.

775
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:05,525
I can't do that.

776
00:19:06,628 --> 00:19:08,493
Well, I mean, I...

777
00:19:09,464 --> 00:19:13,992
I got no proof, have I?

778
00:19:15,003 --> 00:19:17,563
Looks like you've got a war
on your hands, Joey.

779
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:19,036
I'll give a grand...

780
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:23,975
...if I could get
that Mr. Harry-Pervert-Flowers...

781
00:19:24,146 --> 00:19:25,841
...right here, right now.

782
00:19:26,014 --> 00:19:28,175
I'll give a grand in readies.

783
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:30,409
Dirty degenerate.

784
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:33,311
Will I do?

785
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:36,151
What?

786
00:19:36,325 --> 00:19:41,024
I'd have rung up first, Joey,
but your lines is always busy.

787
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:46,528
All five of them.

788
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:54,406
- Let's go.
- What do you mean?

789
00:19:54,576 --> 00:19:57,204
Harry Flowers is waiting for you.

790
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:04,078
That geezer, that's the one, ain't he?

791
00:20:04,253 --> 00:20:06,949
- Ain't he, Joey?
- You stay out of this.

792
00:20:10,692 --> 00:20:14,321
Hold up, that was him that left with him.

793
00:20:14,863 --> 00:20:17,058
Look at this Vietnam strife.

794
00:20:17,232 --> 00:20:18,893
Down with red tape, eh?

795
00:20:19,067 --> 00:20:21,126
No taxman around here, my son.

796
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:24,033
But, Harry, I'm still a bit worried
about my future.

797
00:20:24,206 --> 00:20:26,401
Worried? That I will not allow, my son.

798
00:20:26,575 --> 00:20:28,770
Anyone worries you, you tell me about it.

799
00:20:28,944 --> 00:20:31,811
You're on the firm now, Joey.
One of me own.

800
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:35,472
United we stand, divided we're lumbered.

801
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:38,211
Took over? No, Joey.

802
00:20:38,387 --> 00:20:40,287
The word is "merged."

803
00:20:40,455 --> 00:20:43,754
You was merged, my son.
To old England.

804
00:20:44,426 --> 00:20:46,860
Jack, tell Chas to come over
and have one with us.

805
00:20:47,029 --> 00:20:49,520
- Yeah, sure, Harry.
- Harry, that shop...

806
00:20:49,698 --> 00:20:52,166
- Exactly.
- Listen, no, it's my whole life, Harry.

807
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:56,464
Exactly, Joey. Mine too. Mine too.

808
00:20:56,638 --> 00:20:58,299
Speaking of which, Dennis...

809
00:20:58,473 --> 00:21:01,135
...I’m not at all happy
about the tactless manner...

810
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:03,608
...which Joey was brought here in.

811
00:21:03,779 --> 00:21:06,907
Chas, I told you not to bother
Mr. Maddocks, didn't I?

812
00:21:07,082 --> 00:21:08,344
A whiskey, please, Dave.

813
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:10,985
- Right away, Chas.
- Oh, was I tactless?

814
00:21:11,153 --> 00:21:15,453
Making him say that thing
about his poor dead father? My God.

815
00:21:15,624 --> 00:21:18,855
- Let's take this chat upstairs, shall we?
- Who do you think you are?

816
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:20,119
The Lone Ranger?

817
00:21:20,295 --> 00:21:23,492
- I know who I am, Harry.
- Of course you do, son.

818
00:21:23,899 --> 00:21:26,333
You're Jack the Lad.

819
00:21:26,501 --> 00:21:28,662
I've known a few performers in my time.

820
00:21:28,837 --> 00:21:32,000
But I tell you this, he's got the gift, boy.

821
00:21:32,407 --> 00:21:35,865
- Right, Denny?
- He enjoys his work.

822
00:21:37,446 --> 00:21:39,880
- That's the half of it.
- Do you think he does, Denny?

823
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:43,848
- Oh, I do. I get a load of kicks out of it.
- Which can be a good thing, Chas.

824
00:21:44,019 --> 00:21:47,978
Putting a little stick about.
Putting the frighteners on flash little twerps.

825
00:21:48,657 --> 00:21:53,458
But it can also be a tricky thing.
And I'll tell you why.

826
00:21:53,628 --> 00:21:57,621
Because you can get to enjoy
your work too much, my son.

827
00:21:57,799 --> 00:22:00,529
And it can slip your mind that...

828
00:22:00,969 --> 00:22:03,836
...you're bloody working for me,
you berk!

829
00:22:04,006 --> 00:22:07,908
And when I say me, I mean...
Tell him what I mean, Jack.

830
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:10,237
- You mean you, Harry.
- No.

831
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:11,777
- The business.
- The business.

832
00:22:11,947 --> 00:22:13,812
- That's what he means.
- Correct him one.

833
00:22:13,982 --> 00:22:15,847
In which you're a cog, boy.

834
00:22:16,018 --> 00:22:17,986
A cog in an organ.

835
00:22:18,153 --> 00:22:21,486
- Go to hell, Dennis. I know what I am.
- It's the business of business...

836
00:22:21,656 --> 00:22:23,055
...to push the buttons.

837
00:22:24,626 --> 00:22:27,060
And I'm alive and well.

838
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:31,755
You push the buttons on that thing.

839
00:22:32,067 --> 00:22:34,661
Right. We push them. Us.

840
00:22:34,836 --> 00:22:38,499
This terrific democratic organization.
Right, Joey?

841
00:22:38,673 --> 00:22:40,971
- Right, Harry.
- Same again. All around, Dave.

842
00:22:41,143 --> 00:22:44,203
- Let me do this one, Harry.
- The world's a dodgy place, my friends.

843
00:22:44,379 --> 00:22:46,847
I can't help that. But we've got progress.

844
00:22:47,015 --> 00:22:48,141
Look at the Yanks.

845
00:22:48,316 --> 00:22:50,409
- The New World.
- Organization.

846
00:22:50,585 --> 00:22:52,382
Listen, Chas...

847
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:07,526
That boy's in bother.

848
00:23:07,702 --> 00:23:09,067
Up here.

849
00:23:09,237 --> 00:23:11,603
He's an ignorant boy.

850
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,502
An out-of-date boy.

851
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:43,827
Let go.

852
00:23:45,974 --> 00:23:47,771
Get it. Get it.

853
00:23:54,416 --> 00:23:56,179
Come on, Joey.

854
00:24:05,794 --> 00:24:07,489
Come on, you slick...

855
00:24:11,933 --> 00:24:14,493
Hold his arms now. That's it. Hold him.

856
00:24:21,676 --> 00:24:23,405
Go on then.

857
00:24:26,114 --> 00:24:29,174
Come on, Brien.
Give us a hand over here.

858
00:24:39,027 --> 00:24:41,086
Shall l...? Shall I decorate him, eh, Joey?

859
00:24:41,263 --> 00:24:43,857
No. No. I'm not one of those.

860
00:24:44,666 --> 00:24:46,395
I'm not him.

861
00:24:47,802 --> 00:24:50,032
- You love that, don't you?
- You little twerp.

862
00:24:51,506 --> 00:24:53,064
You vicious little twerp!

863
00:24:54,643 --> 00:24:55,667
Say it!

864
00:24:58,046 --> 00:24:59,411
Say it.

865
00:25:02,484 --> 00:25:04,008
Say it.

866
00:25:04,786 --> 00:25:06,083
Say it.

867
00:25:07,355 --> 00:25:09,050
Come on! Say it!

868
00:25:21,236 --> 00:25:23,704
Chas, say it.

869
00:25:24,472 --> 00:25:27,703
I am...

870
00:25:27,876 --> 00:25:29,468
Yes!

871
00:25:34,749 --> 00:25:36,546
He's out, Joey.

872
00:25:37,085 --> 00:25:38,882
Get some water. Water.

873
00:25:48,663 --> 00:25:52,622
- Give him the kiss of life, Joey.
- You shut your filthy mouth!

874
00:26:19,394 --> 00:26:20,986
Chas.

875
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:24,055
Look.

876
00:26:24,933 --> 00:26:26,662
Chas.

877
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:32,473
You remember me, Chas.

878
00:26:32,907 --> 00:26:34,397
We...

879
00:26:35,076 --> 00:26:36,475
Listen, look...

880
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:41,448
Do you remember Mick?

881
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:43,377
Remember?

882
00:26:43,918 --> 00:26:48,617
Chas, what's the point...

883
00:26:49,391 --> 00:26:51,586
...of this?

884
00:26:56,197 --> 00:27:00,497
You can't do that.

885
00:27:00,669 --> 00:27:03,103
I am a bullet.

886
00:27:17,952 --> 00:27:21,513
Oh, God, my chest hurts.

887
00:27:24,659 --> 00:27:26,251
Look what you've done.

888
00:27:30,532 --> 00:27:32,500
Help me.

889
00:27:40,608 --> 00:27:42,735
You're dead, Joey.

890
00:27:42,977 --> 00:27:45,502
You can stay...

891
00:27:46,181 --> 00:27:47,978
...yesterday...

892
00:27:49,184 --> 00:27:51,345
...until...

893
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:54,249
...tomorrow.

894
00:28:09,204 --> 00:28:10,432
Get out of my flat.

895
00:28:29,591 --> 00:28:31,183
Hey, you!

896
00:28:32,594 --> 00:28:33,720
Just a minute.

897
00:28:49,277 --> 00:28:51,211
Don't you bloody move.

898
00:29:24,813 --> 00:29:27,043
Harry, I won't mince words.

899
00:29:27,215 --> 00:29:28,773
You're more than involved.

900
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:30,884
You're incriminated. Look at the facts.

901
00:29:31,052 --> 00:29:32,041
- The facts.
- One...

902
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:34,484
I'll tell you the facts. Business facts.

903
00:29:34,656 --> 00:29:37,625
Soon as they pick up Devlin,
they'll be all over us, my friends.

904
00:29:37,792 --> 00:29:42,627
Press, taxman, copper, the lot.
You know what they're gonna call us?

905
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:46,098
They'll call us gangsters.

906
00:29:46,601 --> 00:29:49,798
- It'll be goodbye to business.
- We'll be as popular as Hitler.

907
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:53,834
I know you would, pal. I know.

908
00:29:54,275 --> 00:29:57,540
Well, I just don't know
anywhere, mate. But honestly...

909
00:29:58,513 --> 00:30:00,811
- Where is he?
- We're looking, Harry.

910
00:30:00,982 --> 00:30:04,440
Six figures a year, we're into. Six figures.

911
00:30:04,619 --> 00:30:07,520
And now this little bastard...

912
00:30:07,989 --> 00:30:10,219
He's put us in the stuck.

913
00:30:11,259 --> 00:30:13,523
Pity he exists.

914
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:22,027
I never sent him.
It was me told him not to go.

915
00:30:22,203 --> 00:30:25,434
Don't get your personal relations
mixed up in my business.

916
00:30:25,607 --> 00:30:28,804
- I told him.
- Told him? Oh, that's a joke.

917
00:30:28,977 --> 00:30:31,571
Like telling a mad dog
who to bite, that is.

918
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:33,771
I was bitten by a dog once.

919
00:30:33,948 --> 00:30:35,677
When I was a kid.

920
00:30:36,217 --> 00:30:39,584
- It was a wirehaired terrier.
- Harry, I'm your legal adviser.

921
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:43,918
You could be charged
with conspiracy to murder.

922
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:54,497
- Hello?
- <i>Hello? Can I speak to Mr. Flowers?</i>

923
00:30:54,669 --> 00:30:56,864
- Hello, Chas.
- <i>Is Harry there?</i>

924
00:30:57,038 --> 00:30:59,199
Yes, Chas, of course he's here.

925
00:30:59,374 --> 00:31:02,070
Harry, it's Chas.

926
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:11,414
Hello, Chas. Are you hurt bad?

927
00:31:11,586 --> 00:31:14,384
Not too bad. You know already, eh?

928
00:31:14,556 --> 00:31:16,421
It was just...

929
00:31:16,758 --> 00:31:18,919
Just an accident.

930
00:31:19,093 --> 00:31:21,584
Harry, I've gotta get off the street.

931
00:31:21,763 --> 00:31:23,731
Yes, Chas.

932
00:31:23,898 --> 00:31:25,866
Yes, all right.

933
00:31:26,501 --> 00:31:29,231
We'll try to work something out.

934
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:32,963
Harry, you know I'd never lumber you.

935
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:35,735
It's down to me this aggravation,
but I've gotta get in.

936
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:37,775
Where are you?

937
00:31:39,781 --> 00:31:41,976
Chas, hold on a minute.

938
00:31:46,521 --> 00:31:48,853
He's at Wandsworth Bridge Road.

939
00:31:49,457 --> 00:31:51,288
Moody?

940
00:31:52,293 --> 00:31:53,282
What?

941
00:31:54,395 --> 00:31:56,488
What would you do, Moody?

942
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:57,961
Me?

943
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:00,091
With a mad dog, Moody?

944
00:32:04,072 --> 00:32:06,836
When a poor sick animal
is liable to bite you?

945
00:32:08,242 --> 00:32:09,539
Bite me?

946
00:32:10,211 --> 00:32:12,771
Without meaning to.

947
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:14,739
I'd put him to sleep, Dennis.

948
00:32:24,959 --> 00:32:27,860
Harry? Hello?

949
00:32:33,601 --> 00:32:35,159
Hello?

950
00:32:36,571 --> 00:32:39,301
Hello? Harry?

951
00:32:53,354 --> 00:32:57,688
I don't need the details, my son.
Off you... Off you go.

952
00:32:57,859 --> 00:33:00,851
I can rely on him. I can't say more, can I?

953
00:33:01,029 --> 00:33:03,088
He's an artist, eh?

954
00:33:04,599 --> 00:33:06,624
My bath's running.

955
00:34:13,401 --> 00:34:16,598
I can't explain now, Mom,
but it's as bad as can be. Now listen...

956
00:34:16,771 --> 00:34:18,204
- <i>But, Charlie...</i>
- Now listen, Mom.

957
00:34:18,372 --> 00:34:20,840
- <i>But where are you, Charlie?</i>
- I must go away.

958
00:34:21,008 --> 00:34:23,135
Now. Right away.

959
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:24,403
<i>I might go to Aunt Mary.</i>

960
00:34:24,579 --> 00:34:26,672
- Your Aunt Mary?
- <i>Down in Devon.</i>

961
00:34:26,848 --> 00:34:28,543
Yes, go there.

962
00:34:28,716 --> 00:34:31,014
They won't know of her.
Not down in Barnstaple.

963
00:34:31,419 --> 00:34:33,319
- Right.
- <i>Now, behave yourself, mind.</i>

964
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:34,750
Yeah.

965
00:34:34,922 --> 00:34:37,482
- <i>Give her my love, won't you?</i>
- Okay, thanks.

966
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:39,148
- Ta-ta, Mom.
- <i>Bye, Charlie.</i>

967
00:34:44,132 --> 00:34:46,123
I said Barnstaple, not Exeter.

968
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:50,396
I said change at Exeter, mate.
Seven twenty-two. Platform four.

969
00:34:50,638 --> 00:34:52,936
Gets in at 10 past.

970
00:35:21,135 --> 00:35:23,433
One and 10 for sandwich, love.

971
00:35:24,071 --> 00:35:25,231
- Hello, Ma.
- Noel.

972
00:35:25,406 --> 00:35:27,533
Thanks, Ma. You're a darling.

973
00:35:31,946 --> 00:35:33,743
He said, "You call that rock 'n' roll?"

974
00:35:33,915 --> 00:35:37,180
I said, "That's the sound, Mr. Payne.
That's what I'm selling you, man."

975
00:35:37,451 --> 00:35:40,909
He said, "My God, that's a black sound.
It's four times blacker than you."

976
00:35:41,088 --> 00:35:42,612
Liverpool.

977
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:45,782
So I said, "Cool it, man. Cool it.
It's a bad sound."

978
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,791
I'll tell you who comes from Liverpool.

979
00:35:47,962 --> 00:35:49,759
- Mary Tinkling.
- "I'll buy it," he says.

980
00:35:49,931 --> 00:35:52,923
- "You got a gig for six weeks."
- He's a shrewd one, is that.

981
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,500
So Mr. Turner's gonna sublet
your room then, is he?

982
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:58,639
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's cool.

983
00:35:59,106 --> 00:36:00,232
I told him.

984
00:36:00,808 --> 00:36:03,743
I said, "Turner, you are my landlord...

985
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:07,779
...to which I owe 41 pound back rent...

986
00:36:07,949 --> 00:36:11,544
...which I will send to you
from Liverpool pretty soon."

987
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:15,446
He said, "Yeah?"
So I said, "Listen. Listen, baby.

988
00:36:15,623 --> 00:36:16,851
All my things.

989
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:20,516
All my gear, all my sounds,
my big horn. Everything.

990
00:36:20,695 --> 00:36:22,287
My whole life stays right here...

991
00:36:22,463 --> 00:36:26,490
...at 81 Powis Square
in this little basement room."

992
00:36:26,968 --> 00:36:29,937
He says, "Okay, my son, go."

993
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:32,599
I should try to find a cool subtenant...

994
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:34,900
...who has respect
for another person's life.

995
00:36:35,142 --> 00:36:37,838
That Turner, drug addict.

996
00:36:38,012 --> 00:36:40,845
- Come on, Mom. He's just like...
- He's peculiar.

997
00:36:41,182 --> 00:36:44,413
He's peculiar. He's a hermit.

998
00:36:44,785 --> 00:36:47,879
He can't face reality. That's what it is.

999
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:51,357
A world of their own, these kids.

1000
00:37:02,737 --> 00:37:05,501
Powis Square, Notting Hill Gate.

1001
00:38:10,471 --> 00:38:14,430
<i>This is a recording.</i>
<i>Speak now what you want.</i>

1002
00:38:14,942 --> 00:38:16,409
Hello, is Mr. Turner there?

1003
00:38:16,577 --> 00:38:18,374
<i>Speak on the third peep.</i>

1004
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:21,413
<i>Peep. Peep. Peep.</i>

1005
00:38:22,016 --> 00:38:24,484
I'm a... I'm a friend of Noel's.

1006
00:38:24,652 --> 00:38:25,914
An old friend.

1007
00:38:26,087 --> 00:38:27,315
It's about the room.

1008
00:38:27,488 --> 00:38:29,319
The basement room.

1009
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:30,957
I've just seen him off actually.

1010
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:33,056
Me and his mom.

1011
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:37,030
Oh, good morning. Are you there?
I'm a bit on the early side.

1012
00:38:37,198 --> 00:38:39,462
<i>You've got the wrong house, mister.</i>

1013
00:38:39,767 --> 00:38:42,395
- <i>Fruit off.</i>
- No, listen.

1014
00:38:43,137 --> 00:38:44,866
- I've got it right here.
- <i>Right where?</i>

1015
00:38:45,039 --> 00:38:48,338
The back rent. It's 41 pound, right?

1016
00:38:48,509 --> 00:38:52,172
He said, "Just settle up with Mr. Turner
and the room's yours, pal."

1017
00:38:52,346 --> 00:38:53,938
- Stroke of luck, eh?
- <i>You think so?</i>

1018
00:38:54,115 --> 00:38:56,208
I'm in the entertainment business.
You know...

1019
00:38:56,384 --> 00:38:59,080
...show business.
And I saw Noel at the railway...

1020
00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:00,686
Hello? Hello?

1021
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:04,554
- <i>Oh, yes, yes. Is that you?</i>
- Yes.

1022
00:39:04,725 --> 00:39:06,420
<i>The basement room, in the basement.</i>

1023
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:08,118
That's it, dear. That's it. Yeah.

1024
00:39:08,295 --> 00:39:11,025
- <i>Down the back stairs.</i>
- Yeah.

1025
00:39:12,867 --> 00:39:14,994
<i>Push!</i>

1026
00:39:15,236 --> 00:39:17,500
Do it again a bit longer.

1027
00:40:13,861 --> 00:40:16,295
- Hello.
- I didn't recognize your voice.

1028
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:17,926
- No?
- No.

1029
00:40:18,099 --> 00:40:19,896
Oh, no. I've been away, haven't I?

1030
00:40:20,868 --> 00:40:22,893
And I don't recognize your face.

1031
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:24,765
My face?

1032
00:40:27,241 --> 00:40:28,731
Well, you should see the motor.

1033
00:40:28,909 --> 00:40:31,241
- See the what?
- My motor.

1034
00:40:31,412 --> 00:40:34,973
We had a little argument with a cement wall
on the way up from Dover.

1035
00:40:35,149 --> 00:40:37,310
Goodbye, the Ferrari.

1036
00:40:39,887 --> 00:40:41,855
It's down here, right?

1037
00:40:42,389 --> 00:40:43,981
First left I think he said.

1038
00:40:44,158 --> 00:40:46,058
Oh, my mistake.

1039
00:40:50,164 --> 00:40:51,927
Goodbye, the Rolls Royce.

1040
00:40:52,099 --> 00:40:53,999
I know what you mean.

1041
00:40:54,168 --> 00:40:57,535
Look after my gear, pal. My big horn.

1042
00:40:57,705 --> 00:41:00,037
Yeah, there I was just back
from the continent...

1043
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:02,835
...from a continental tour
and this had to happen.

1044
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:05,604
Oh, very nice.

1045
00:41:07,114 --> 00:41:09,378
It's characteristic.

1046
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,211
I'll take it.

1047
00:41:16,023 --> 00:41:18,491
Dean's the name. Johnny Dean.

1048
00:41:20,628 --> 00:41:21,856
Look, regards from Noel.

1049
00:41:22,029 --> 00:41:23,860
I got the 41 pounds for you.

1050
00:41:24,031 --> 00:41:25,259
I owe it to him actually...

1051
00:41:25,432 --> 00:41:28,026
...but that's another story
and I won't bore you with it.

1052
00:41:28,202 --> 00:41:32,263
So a week in advance will be...

1053
00:41:32,439 --> 00:41:33,736
Sixty-six pounds.

1054
00:41:34,441 --> 00:41:35,669
- Sixty-six pounds.
- Plus...

1055
00:41:35,843 --> 00:41:38,607
...one week deposit on the fittings
and the fixtures...

1056
00:41:39,146 --> 00:41:42,513
...plus, I should have
a banker's reference.

1057
00:41:42,683 --> 00:41:45,151
Listen, that's...

1058
00:41:45,786 --> 00:41:47,378
Extortionate?

1059
00:41:48,989 --> 00:41:53,221
- Of course.
- Well, I'd say that was...

1060
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:57,731
One hundred and thirty-two pounds.

1061
00:42:04,038 --> 00:42:06,734
How do you entertain?

1062
00:42:10,044 --> 00:42:11,409
- I juggle.
- Juggle?

1063
00:42:11,579 --> 00:42:14,776
Juggle, juggle. I've got a load
of bookings here in London.

1064
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:16,177
They're all A-one venues.

1065
00:42:18,519 --> 00:42:21,386
- No luck, have I?
- No.

1066
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:44,368
Hey, Mom, when's Christmas?

1067
00:43:11,071 --> 00:43:13,596
Goodbye, the Ferrari.

1068
00:46:38,912 --> 00:46:40,140
You're pissed.

1069
00:46:44,852 --> 00:46:46,285
You've had one over the eight.

1070
00:46:47,621 --> 00:46:49,020
No, I haven't.

1071
00:46:49,189 --> 00:46:50,451
I'm the new lodger.

1072
00:46:50,691 --> 00:46:52,386
Do you want an aspirin?

1073
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:55,153
- Want a cup of tea?
- Yeah, that'll be lovely.

1074
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:57,363
- Have you got some turps?
- Turps?

1075
00:46:58,131 --> 00:47:01,658
- Do you wanna earn a bob?
- Two bob, mate.

1076
00:47:02,870 --> 00:47:04,098
All right.

1077
00:47:04,271 --> 00:47:06,705
Go and buy me a bottle of turpentine.

1078
00:47:06,874 --> 00:47:08,364
Five bob, mate.

1079
00:47:10,677 --> 00:47:12,542
Half a dollar.

1080
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:15,611
Okay.

1081
00:47:18,819 --> 00:47:21,515
So I say to this guy at the office:

1082
00:47:21,688 --> 00:47:23,883
"Why are you so mean?"

1083
00:47:24,057 --> 00:47:27,788
- And he just say, "Your visa is finished."
- Please.

1084
00:47:27,961 --> 00:47:31,453
"And... And you're...
You're not in a place of learning, right?"

1085
00:47:31,632 --> 00:47:33,361
Right.

1086
00:47:33,534 --> 00:47:35,161
"And you've got...

1087
00:47:35,335 --> 00:47:38,327
And you've got to get out
of the British Kingdom...

1088
00:47:38,505 --> 00:47:40,234
...and to go back to France."

1089
00:47:40,407 --> 00:47:42,307
That's really insanity.

1090
00:47:42,476 --> 00:47:44,706
You poor little thing.

1091
00:47:44,878 --> 00:47:46,345
When was all this?

1092
00:47:46,513 --> 00:47:50,108
I don't know. Last week I think it was.

1093
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:51,512
Last month.

1094
00:47:51,685 --> 00:47:52,913
So I say:

1095
00:47:53,086 --> 00:47:55,111
"Pherber is teaching me English,
you know...

1096
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:57,814
...and that his boyfriend
is learning me his books...

1097
00:47:57,991 --> 00:48:00,391
...and everything... My magic stories!"

1098
00:48:03,196 --> 00:48:04,857
First thing in the bloody morning.

1099
00:48:05,032 --> 00:48:08,661
And then he asks me,
"Where are you living?"

1100
00:48:08,835 --> 00:48:11,702
- I say, "I don't remember."
- I've got a crippled tap dancer...

1101
00:48:11,872 --> 00:48:13,100
...in my bloody basement.

1102
00:48:13,273 --> 00:48:16,333
- He said, "This is very illegal."
- Yeah, he said that.

1103
00:48:16,510 --> 00:48:19,411
So I said, "The Hilton Hotel."

1104
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:22,071
Listen, I don't want any more bums
in my basement.

1105
00:48:22,249 --> 00:48:23,477
A juggler, madam.

1106
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:24,981
- I don't want her.
- Juggler.

1107
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:26,847
- I don't want her.
- You'd love her.

1108
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:29,284
Yeah, you might like her.

1109
00:48:29,656 --> 00:48:30,884
You'd love him.

1110
00:48:31,058 --> 00:48:33,151
Do you think I should wash my hair?

1111
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:35,389
- No.
- And he said:

1112
00:48:35,562 --> 00:48:37,086
"You juvenile in moral danger."

1113
00:48:37,264 --> 00:48:39,960
- Go on.
- "And you're not desirable."

1114
00:48:44,805 --> 00:48:47,069
So I said, "You stupid shit."

1115
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:50,107
And I spit and I ran away.

1116
00:48:50,744 --> 00:48:53,770
Well, just when I got
my skull completely empty.

1117
00:48:53,947 --> 00:48:55,471
Shower?

1118
00:49:01,955 --> 00:49:04,116
Plus banker's deposit.

1119
00:49:04,291 --> 00:49:06,919
Plus money for fixtures and fittings.

1120
00:49:07,094 --> 00:49:08,322
So I didn't get my visa.

1121
00:49:08,495 --> 00:49:11,089
Plus references for one week.

1122
00:49:11,264 --> 00:49:13,664
- Well, I'm not worried.
- Plus one week on account...

1123
00:49:13,834 --> 00:49:16,928
...that makes 167 pounds.

1124
00:49:17,104 --> 00:49:19,800
Here, give it to me. I'll do it. I'll do it.

1125
00:49:20,307 --> 00:49:23,970
- Oh, they'll never find me.
- There you are. Beautiful.

1126
00:49:26,947 --> 00:49:29,177
- I'm not worried.
- Nope, you shouldn't worry.

1127
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:32,211
Anyone want a cup of tea?

1128
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:35,048
Where's my porridge, Lorraine?

1129
00:49:35,555 --> 00:49:38,183
Tony! Your uncle for you!

1130
00:49:39,326 --> 00:49:41,351
Put them over there, mate.

1131
00:49:44,798 --> 00:49:46,288
Oh, yeah.

1132
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:49,634
- Chas?
- What's happening in the outside world?

1133
00:49:49,803 --> 00:49:52,237
<i>Ain't you seen the papers yet, mate?</i>

1134
00:49:52,539 --> 00:49:55,975
- No, I haven't bothered.
- They're really gonna turn on you, my son.

1135
00:49:56,143 --> 00:49:58,077
- You are the front page.
- <i>Oh, yeah?</i>

1136
00:49:58,512 --> 00:50:01,379
- What else?
- <i>Well, I've had the filth.</i>

1137
00:50:01,548 --> 00:50:04,244
And I've have the firm.
Well, the law, that was nothing.

1138
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:07,080
But your friend, Rosybloom,
he's funny, isn't he?

1139
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:09,154
- No aggravation?
- <i>No, no.</i>

1140
00:50:09,389 --> 00:50:11,050
But stand on me, uncle.

1141
00:50:11,224 --> 00:50:13,658
It weren't your welfare he was on about.

1142
00:50:13,827 --> 00:50:15,556
Actually...

1143
00:50:15,729 --> 00:50:21,031
...he's obviously very, very
deeply involve with Noel.

1144
00:50:23,070 --> 00:50:26,164
I don't want any invalid...

1145
00:50:26,339 --> 00:50:31,038
...washed-up cabaret artists
in my beautiful basement, sir.

1146
00:50:31,411 --> 00:50:33,276
Tony, I'm getting out.

1147
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:35,347
Out of the country.

1148
00:50:36,049 --> 00:50:37,949
<i>Out of the country?</i>

1149
00:50:39,586 --> 00:50:41,281
Now listen, Tone.

1150
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:43,787
I'm gonna tell you
where I keep my rainy-day money.

1151
00:50:46,827 --> 00:50:49,853
You shoot too much of that shit, Pherber.

1152
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:56,258
Too much vitamin B12
has never hurt anybody.

1153
00:50:56,737 --> 00:51:00,104
- Behind the boiler, you mean?
- <i>Well behind. Persevere.</i>

1154
00:51:00,407 --> 00:51:02,238
There's two grand in that bag, Tone.

1155
00:51:02,409 --> 00:51:05,606
First off, I want you to nick a drink
for yourself. Five hundred quid.

1156
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:08,477
You're a gentleman, Chas.

1157
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:09,876
No, I want you to have it.

1158
00:51:10,050 --> 00:51:11,278
You and Marge.

1159
00:51:11,451 --> 00:51:13,009
Now second off...

1160
00:51:13,186 --> 00:51:15,313
...I’ve gotta get a passport.

1161
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:17,650
There's a geezer... Have you got a pencil?

1162
00:51:17,824 --> 00:51:20,156
Cypriot geezer. His name is Thanopoulos.

1163
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:23,125
Hey, Johnny,
Mom says do you want an egg?

1164
00:51:23,296 --> 00:51:25,730
You got that, Tone? Goodbye.

1165
00:51:25,899 --> 00:51:28,561
And Turner says will you come up
and see him, please.

1166
00:51:28,735 --> 00:51:31,761
All right, Lorrie. I'll be up.

1167
00:51:34,641 --> 00:51:36,836
- What a freak show.
- Where are you then?

1168
00:51:37,077 --> 00:51:38,408
Oh, you know, on the left.

1169
00:51:38,578 --> 00:51:40,842
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- I tell you, it's terrible.

1170
00:51:41,414 --> 00:51:43,473
It's a right pisshole.

1171
00:51:43,984 --> 00:51:45,849
Long hair...

1172
00:51:46,019 --> 00:51:47,350
...beatniks...

1173
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:49,614
...druggers, free love...

1174
00:51:50,023 --> 00:51:51,752
<i>... foreigners, you name it.</i>

1175
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:54,752
But I'm not bothered, Tone. I'm well in.

1176
00:51:54,928 --> 00:51:57,089
And you couldn't find
a better hidey-hole.

1177
00:52:09,075 --> 00:52:11,043
In you go, Dad.

1178
00:53:37,664 --> 00:53:39,097
Afternoon, Mr. Turner.

1179
00:53:39,266 --> 00:53:42,167
Good afternoon, Mr...

1180
00:53:44,104 --> 00:53:46,436
There's been a mistake.

1181
00:53:46,773 --> 00:53:48,764
You can't have the room.

1182
00:53:48,942 --> 00:53:50,170
What?

1183
00:53:50,343 --> 00:53:52,277
It's not for rent.

1184
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:55,172
Wait a minute. The lady just said...

1185
00:53:55,348 --> 00:53:58,181
The lady said?

1186
00:53:58,985 --> 00:54:01,180
I don't tell her everything.

1187
00:54:01,354 --> 00:54:03,549
She's my secretary.

1188
00:54:03,957 --> 00:54:06,289
I got a lot of work to do.

1189
00:54:06,993 --> 00:54:09,018
Under a lot of pressure.

1190
00:54:10,997 --> 00:54:12,225
Here.

1191
00:54:12,399 --> 00:54:14,162
No, I don't want it.

1192
00:54:15,902 --> 00:54:17,733
That carpet's 200 years old.

1193
00:54:17,904 --> 00:54:19,337
It looks it.

1194
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:20,837
A valuable antique, is it?

1195
00:54:24,844 --> 00:54:29,679
Listen, I got to say goodbye now.

1196
00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:32,374
Mr. Turner, I've got all my luggage,
my stage gear...

1197
00:54:32,552 --> 00:54:35,020
...it's all coming here from the continent.

1198
00:54:35,455 --> 00:54:36,945
Your what?

1199
00:54:37,123 --> 00:54:40,991
My luggage.
My juggling, you know, stuff.

1200
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:43,526
Why don't you go to a hotel?

1201
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:47,030
A hotel? You must be joking.

1202
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:50,260
Look, I need a...

1203
00:54:50,437 --> 00:54:53,065
I need a bohemian atmosphere.

1204
00:54:53,239 --> 00:54:56,697
I'm an artist, Mr. Turner.

1205
00:54:57,410 --> 00:54:59,173
Like yourself.

1206
00:55:00,981 --> 00:55:04,280
- You juggle?
- Why not?

1207
00:55:04,451 --> 00:55:07,818
Why, why not? Why not a jongleur?

1208
00:55:07,988 --> 00:55:10,582
It's the third oldest profession.

1209
00:55:10,757 --> 00:55:14,352
You're a performer of natural magic.

1210
00:55:17,630 --> 00:55:19,530
I... I perform.

1211
00:55:19,833 --> 00:55:21,664
I bet you do.

1212
00:55:21,835 --> 00:55:24,497
I can tell by your vibrations...

1213
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:27,037
...you're the anti-gravity man!

1214
00:55:29,242 --> 00:55:30,800
Amateur night at the Apollo.

1215
00:55:32,112 --> 00:55:33,807
Cheops in his bloody pyramid.

1216
00:55:34,681 --> 00:55:37,149
He dug a juggler or two, didn't he?
Remember?

1217
00:55:43,189 --> 00:55:45,180
And the tetrarchs of Sodom...

1218
00:55:45,358 --> 00:55:47,189
...and Orbis Tertius.

1219
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:49,794
Am I right? Am I right, babe?

1220
00:55:49,963 --> 00:55:51,555
More or less.

1221
00:55:51,731 --> 00:55:54,256
Personally, I just, you know...

1222
00:55:54,434 --> 00:55:56,368
...perform.

1223
00:55:56,836 --> 00:55:59,396
Oh, you're a modest chap.

1224
00:56:04,377 --> 00:56:07,141
Because after all, there was only one.
Only one.

1225
00:56:07,313 --> 00:56:09,474
- Only one what?
- And right you are.

1226
00:56:09,649 --> 00:56:11,082
Enrico Rastelli.

1227
00:56:11,251 --> 00:56:14,778
- You said it all, pal.
- Juggler to the King of Tuscany.

1228
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:16,216
Now, about the room...

1229
00:56:16,389 --> 00:56:17,720
Fourteen balls.

1230
00:56:17,891 --> 00:56:20,189
How about just on a...
On a nightly basis?

1231
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:21,987
Right. On a nightly basis.

1232
00:56:22,162 --> 00:56:24,255
On a horse.

1233
00:56:24,431 --> 00:56:26,422
And blindfold.

1234
00:56:26,966 --> 00:56:28,900
Talk about a performer.

1235
00:56:29,069 --> 00:56:32,903
Of course, I'm not telling you anything
you don't know, am I, old man?

1236
00:56:34,574 --> 00:56:37,543
You can't stay here, old man.

1237
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:42,580
Not in the mood?

1238
00:56:44,451 --> 00:56:47,682
Why don't you play us a tune, pal?

1239
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:52,257
I don't like music.

1240
00:56:52,859 --> 00:56:54,690
Comical little geezer.

1241
00:56:54,861 --> 00:56:57,386
You'll look funny when you're 50.

1242
00:56:58,498 --> 00:57:00,830
You'll have to go.

1243
00:57:01,301 --> 00:57:04,236
You wouldn't like it here.

1244
00:57:05,605 --> 00:57:07,004
Not like it?

1245
00:57:07,173 --> 00:57:09,232
A charming little basement suite?

1246
00:57:09,409 --> 00:57:10,967
I paid for it.

1247
00:57:11,144 --> 00:57:12,873
I love it.

1248
00:57:14,647 --> 00:57:16,444
No.

1249
00:57:16,783 --> 00:57:19,115
You wouldn't fit in here.

1250
00:57:19,285 --> 00:57:20,718
I would.

1251
00:57:20,887 --> 00:57:23,185
I'm determined to fit in.

1252
00:57:23,923 --> 00:57:26,824
I've got to fit in, Mr. Turner.

1253
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:33,127
I see.

1254
00:57:33,299 --> 00:57:35,324
It's that bad, eh?

1255
00:57:37,637 --> 00:57:39,571
I wonder, Mr. Dean...

1256
00:57:39,739 --> 00:57:43,140
...if you were me, what would you do?

1257
00:57:45,411 --> 00:57:46,742
I don't know.

1258
00:57:46,913 --> 00:57:48,141
It depends.

1259
00:57:48,314 --> 00:57:50,145
It depends who you are.

1260
00:57:50,316 --> 00:57:51,806
Which I don't know.

1261
00:57:51,985 --> 00:57:54,818
Who I am? Do you know who you are?

1262
00:57:56,389 --> 00:57:57,549
Yes.

1263
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:02,885
Well, that simplifies matters.

1264
00:58:03,062 --> 00:58:04,552
You can stay.

1265
00:58:05,398 --> 00:58:07,389
On a daily basis.

1266
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:10,365
Yesterday until tomorrow, all right?

1267
00:58:16,476 --> 00:58:17,465
Thanks.

1268
01:00:01,310 --> 01:00:02,675
He wasn't that big.

1269
01:00:02,845 --> 01:00:04,244
I remember him quite well.

1270
01:00:04,413 --> 01:00:06,540
He was and all.

1271
01:00:07,116 --> 01:00:08,879
He was world-famous.

1272
01:00:09,051 --> 01:00:11,747
Well, when I was a nipper
he was chart-buster.

1273
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:14,445
They come and they go. Pop stars.

1274
01:00:14,623 --> 01:00:15,851
He had a following.

1275
01:00:16,024 --> 01:00:17,616
I never fancied his stuff, myself.

1276
01:00:17,793 --> 01:00:19,124
I fancied him.

1277
01:00:19,294 --> 01:00:20,659
Old rubber lips.

1278
01:00:20,829 --> 01:00:22,126
He had three number one's...

1279
01:00:22,297 --> 01:00:24,356
...and two number two's
and a number four.

1280
01:00:25,901 --> 01:00:27,732
Fetch that tea over here, Lorrie.

1281
01:00:30,372 --> 01:00:32,932
Didn't last though, did it, his success?

1282
01:00:33,108 --> 01:00:36,600
- Well, he retired, didn't he?
- Oh, did he?

1283
01:00:36,845 --> 01:00:38,608
So, what's he do now then?

1284
01:00:38,781 --> 01:00:42,046
He stays... He stays here.
He's writing a book and some music.

1285
01:00:42,217 --> 01:00:44,742
Oh, yeah?
Is that why he's got a secretary?

1286
01:00:45,888 --> 01:00:48,789
That foreign bird, you know,
not the skinny one, the other one.

1287
01:00:48,957 --> 01:00:51,653
Pherber? Pherber's his lover, mate.

1288
01:00:51,827 --> 01:00:54,887
She cohabits with him
since years and years.

1289
01:00:55,364 --> 01:00:58,060
- Their love story's famous.
- Oh, yeah?

1290
01:00:58,333 --> 01:01:00,324
Yeah, you don't know nothing,
do you, Dad?

1291
01:01:02,905 --> 01:01:06,636
- When's Mom coming?
- Tonight.

1292
01:01:09,211 --> 01:01:10,872
That won't fit in, honey.

1293
01:01:11,046 --> 01:01:13,014
Look, it's all holes.

1294
01:01:13,182 --> 01:01:14,809
That won't fit in.

1295
01:01:14,983 --> 01:01:19,044
I know. I know how to do it.
Come on, I know. Here it is.

1296
01:01:19,655 --> 01:01:21,589
Look, this is the one.

1297
01:01:21,757 --> 01:01:23,190
You're getting fat, Lorraine.

1298
01:01:23,826 --> 01:01:25,088
Beans make you fat.

1299
01:01:25,494 --> 01:01:27,553
I'm sick of beans.

1300
01:01:28,564 --> 01:01:30,930
I don't really like that guy.

1301
01:01:31,099 --> 01:01:32,726
I think he's horrible.

1302
01:01:33,068 --> 01:01:36,265
You don't really like him, do you?

1303
01:01:37,372 --> 01:01:40,398
- What do you want...?
- I don't want anything!

1304
01:01:40,576 --> 01:01:43,443
I just let things happen!

1305
01:01:43,745 --> 01:01:45,269
Why did Turner let him stay?

1306
01:01:48,817 --> 01:01:50,717
- He changed his mind.
- Why?

1307
01:01:50,886 --> 01:01:53,650
Why did he let him stay? Why?

1308
01:01:57,092 --> 01:01:58,457
Mr. Dean?

1309
01:01:58,627 --> 01:02:01,221
Would you like me
to do your room now?

1310
01:02:01,396 --> 01:02:02,727
Oh, hello, Mrs. Gibbs.

1311
01:02:02,898 --> 01:02:04,160
No, thanks, dear. No.

1312
01:02:04,333 --> 01:02:05,561
Tomorrow will be fine.

1313
01:02:05,734 --> 01:02:08,168
Thanks a lot, love. Thank you.

1314
01:02:08,770 --> 01:02:11,933
<i>"At this point,</i>
<i>something unforeseeable occurred.</i>

1315
01:02:12,107 --> 01:02:15,042
<i>From a corner of the room,</i>
<i>the old ecstatic gaucho...</i>

1316
01:02:15,210 --> 01:02:18,373
<i>... threw him a naked dagger</i>
<i>which landed at his feet.</i>

1317
01:02:19,147 --> 01:02:21,581
Dalman bent over to pick it up.

1318
01:02:21,750 --> 01:02:24,446
'They would not have allowed
such things to happen to me...

1319
01:02:24,620 --> 01:02:26,952
...in the sanitarium,' he thought.

1320
01:02:27,122 --> 01:02:28,783
And he felt two things.

1321
01:02:28,957 --> 01:02:31,016
- The first..."
- Yes.

1322
01:02:31,193 --> 01:02:33,184
I know why.

1323
01:02:33,428 --> 01:02:35,896
- Yeah?
- Yes.

1324
01:02:37,566 --> 01:02:40,660
- What is it?
- I got a fly.

1325
01:02:40,836 --> 01:02:42,565
A fly?

1326
01:02:43,005 --> 01:02:44,905
In my eye.

1327
01:02:47,943 --> 01:02:50,844
- Why?
- Because you're afraid of him.

1328
01:02:51,013 --> 01:02:53,174
Yes, right.

1329
01:02:53,348 --> 01:02:54,940
Right.

1330
01:02:56,218 --> 01:02:57,981
And he's afraid too.

1331
01:02:58,887 --> 01:03:00,548
Of you?

1332
01:03:06,562 --> 01:03:08,462
Blower for you, Tony.

1333
01:03:10,299 --> 01:03:13,325
- <i>Hello, uncle. How are you?</i>
- Not bad, Tony.

1334
01:03:13,735 --> 01:03:16,169
Listen, I saw Thanopoulos.

1335
01:03:16,338 --> 01:03:18,033
He said, "Okay, yeah."

1336
01:03:18,206 --> 01:03:20,197
He can get you on a freighter.

1337
01:03:20,375 --> 01:03:22,275
Direct to the big city, New York.

1338
01:03:22,544 --> 01:03:23,875
<i>Yeah, it'll cost you though.</i>

1339
01:03:24,046 --> 01:03:27,880
This includes seaman's papers, passport,
graft to the skipper, all included.

1340
01:03:28,050 --> 01:03:29,881
<i>Nine hundred quid.</i>

1341
01:03:30,285 --> 01:03:32,185
Nine hundred?

1342
01:03:33,322 --> 01:03:34,584
The old robber.

1343
01:03:34,756 --> 01:03:36,223
<i>Well, that's his rate.</i>

1344
01:03:36,391 --> 01:03:38,951
No, Tony, you done very well.
You done very well.

1345
01:03:39,127 --> 01:03:42,062
- Good. When do I go?
- This week. Definitely.

1346
01:03:42,230 --> 01:03:43,458
Yeah.

1347
01:03:43,632 --> 01:03:45,190
Now listen.

1348
01:03:45,367 --> 01:03:47,835
He wants a little picture of you, mate.

1349
01:03:48,003 --> 01:03:50,665
Yeah, a little photograph
for your passport.

1350
01:03:51,139 --> 01:03:54,165
- <i>You know what I mean?</i>
- Oh, yeah. I get you. I get you.

1351
01:03:54,343 --> 01:03:56,607
Thanopoulos, he said,
"If you're friend's smart...

1352
01:03:56,778 --> 01:03:59,804
...he'll wanna look decidedly different
to what he normally does."

1353
01:04:00,148 --> 01:04:01,410
<i>Grow a beard.</i>

1354
01:04:01,583 --> 01:04:03,949
No, I'll think of something, Tone.
Don't worry.

1355
01:04:04,119 --> 01:04:06,178
<i>Right then,</i>
<i>I'll hear from you tonight...</i>

1356
01:04:06,355 --> 01:04:08,721
...at my gaff, 9:00, all right?

1357
01:04:08,991 --> 01:04:10,219
Chin up, uncle.

1358
01:04:10,392 --> 01:04:12,155
The land of opportunity awaits, eh?

1359
01:04:47,896 --> 01:04:50,023
- Three years too late.
- You said you wanted it.

1360
01:04:50,465 --> 01:04:52,365
I can't afford it.

1361
01:04:53,035 --> 01:04:55,731
I'm not sure if I like it, anyway.

1362
01:04:55,904 --> 01:04:57,963
I'll keep the frame.

1363
01:05:02,210 --> 01:05:03,609
Oh, come on, forget it.

1364
01:05:03,779 --> 01:05:06,612
He never buys anything.
Let's go back to Ula's.

1365
01:05:07,315 --> 01:05:09,044
Let's go.

1366
01:05:33,575 --> 01:05:35,167
Don't.

1367
01:05:41,416 --> 01:05:42,940
Oh, there you are.

1368
01:05:43,118 --> 01:05:46,645
Sorry to disturb, but has anyone
got a sixpence for the phone?

1369
01:05:47,923 --> 01:05:50,517
Can I use the blower up here?

1370
01:05:50,692 --> 01:05:53,320
We haven't got a blower up here.

1371
01:05:54,563 --> 01:05:57,088
What in God's name has he done
to his hair?

1372
01:05:59,234 --> 01:06:00,724
He's blown it.

1373
01:06:00,902 --> 01:06:02,665
Yeah, well, that's it, dear.

1374
01:06:02,838 --> 01:06:04,601
- I gotta ring up my agent again.
- Dye.

1375
01:06:04,873 --> 01:06:08,741
- I fancied the red.
- No, no, it was the red that was dyed.

1376
01:06:09,611 --> 01:06:10,635
Dead. Dyed.

1377
01:06:13,615 --> 01:06:15,173
- Red.
- Dyed it.

1378
01:06:15,851 --> 01:06:17,375
Dead.

1379
01:06:17,552 --> 01:06:19,816
Red. Red.

1380
01:06:22,758 --> 01:06:24,089
Van Gogh, eh?

1381
01:06:24,259 --> 01:06:25,487
Oh, no. This is the normal.

1382
01:06:25,660 --> 01:06:27,958
- The normal?
- Yeah. I was just having a laugh.

1383
01:06:28,130 --> 01:06:31,759
Having a laugh, you see?
With my act. With my image.

1384
01:06:32,367 --> 01:06:36,030
- You know what I mean?
- I know exactly what you mean.

1385
01:06:36,304 --> 01:06:38,033
Thought you would.

1386
01:06:38,907 --> 01:06:40,568
He reckons, my agent...

1387
01:06:40,742 --> 01:06:43,336
...that it's time for a change.

1388
01:06:43,512 --> 01:06:45,377
It's time for a change.

1389
01:06:45,547 --> 01:06:46,775
Well, I can see his point.

1390
01:06:46,948 --> 01:06:49,678
Yeah, so can I.

1391
01:06:49,851 --> 01:06:52,752
Personally, casting one's mind back.

1392
01:06:52,921 --> 01:06:54,354
Yeah?

1393
01:06:55,056 --> 01:06:58,651
- I rather liked it.
- The...?

1394
01:06:59,828 --> 01:07:02,820
No, you fool. Your act.

1395
01:07:02,998 --> 01:07:05,159
Your image.

1396
01:07:05,700 --> 01:07:07,759
We just remembered, see.

1397
01:07:07,936 --> 01:07:10,666
We've seen it.
We caught it in Hamburg. Your act.

1398
01:07:10,839 --> 01:07:14,002
- Oh, yes, it was fascinating.
- Oh, mushrooms. I like them fried.

1399
01:07:14,176 --> 01:07:16,076
Hungry, eh?

1400
01:07:16,244 --> 01:07:18,576
Even though, as one artist to another...

1401
01:07:18,747 --> 01:07:20,612
...it is a bit old-fashioned.

1402
01:07:22,217 --> 01:07:24,879
Yeah, well, I am a bit old-fashioned.

1403
01:07:26,721 --> 01:07:28,916
Or was it Berlin?

1404
01:07:31,793 --> 01:07:33,021
No, thanks.

1405
01:07:33,195 --> 01:07:35,629
Was it last year? Or was it '67?

1406
01:07:35,797 --> 01:07:37,128
- Sixty six.
- Sixty nine.

1407
01:07:37,299 --> 01:07:39,790
- Was it Paris?
- Goodbye the Bugatti.

1408
01:07:39,968 --> 01:07:41,936
- It was Wembley.
- Why not?

1409
01:07:43,038 --> 01:07:44,699
No. Tokyo.

1410
01:07:45,507 --> 01:07:48,203
- Tokyo?
- Tokyo. The World's Fair.

1411
01:07:48,376 --> 01:07:50,867
Oh, yes. It was Tokyo.

1412
01:07:54,049 --> 01:07:55,778
No, thanks.

1413
01:07:56,551 --> 01:07:58,815
Yeah, it was Tokyo.

1414
01:07:59,020 --> 01:08:00,988
Definitely.

1415
01:08:05,427 --> 01:08:08,260
Speaking of which, I just come across
downstairs on the floor.

1416
01:08:08,430 --> 01:08:10,421
This will sound funny,
but have you got one?

1417
01:08:10,899 --> 01:08:12,526
A Polaroid?

1418
01:08:18,073 --> 01:08:19,802
Time for a change.

1419
01:08:20,508 --> 01:08:22,237
Have we got one?

1420
01:08:23,078 --> 01:08:25,478
- Yes, no.
- Yes, no.

1421
01:08:29,317 --> 01:08:31,444
Just for a lark, I thought, eh?

1422
01:08:31,620 --> 01:08:34,248
Little Lorraine set it off.
Gave me the idea.

1423
01:08:34,422 --> 01:08:38,051
Yeah, we often lark about
with the Polaroid.

1424
01:08:38,226 --> 01:08:41,821
- Me and the girls.
- Oh, yeah? I got a Leica N3 myself.

1425
01:08:49,070 --> 01:08:51,732
- I never wear hats.
- Not even when performing?

1426
01:08:51,907 --> 01:08:54,899
- Never. No.
- What you wear then?

1427
01:08:55,076 --> 01:08:56,976
Look here.

1428
01:08:57,245 --> 01:08:59,145
Well, loose...

1429
01:08:59,314 --> 01:09:01,214
Loose things.

1430
01:09:03,218 --> 01:09:05,584
Marvelous picture.

1431
01:09:06,788 --> 01:09:09,018
Yeah, I never wear hats.

1432
01:09:09,190 --> 01:09:11,283
Oh, right, you like the mushrooms fried.

1433
01:09:11,459 --> 01:09:13,518
- Sorry.
- No, no.

1434
01:09:13,828 --> 01:09:15,056
Why don't you try this?

1435
01:09:15,230 --> 01:09:18,222
- I'll try anything once.
- You'll like it, it's continental.

1436
01:09:19,634 --> 01:09:21,625
Yeah, you're a good cook, Pherber.

1437
01:09:21,803 --> 01:09:23,236
Are these...?

1438
01:09:23,405 --> 01:09:28,342
Are these photographs for narcissistic...

1439
01:09:30,645 --> 01:09:32,476
...or publicity purposes?

1440
01:09:32,847 --> 01:09:33,871
What?

1441
01:09:34,049 --> 01:09:36,882
Because if you're planning
to disseminate postcard-sized...

1442
01:09:37,052 --> 01:09:40,044
- Have you got a drop of Scotch?
- No, I'm sorry.

1443
01:09:40,221 --> 01:09:44,419
- Offset litho reproductions
of these by the thousand, then...

1444
01:09:44,592 --> 01:09:45,650
Oh, no, no, no.

1445
01:09:45,827 --> 01:09:48,022
- These are just for my agent.
- You see my point?

1446
01:09:48,463 --> 01:09:50,397
Of course I can. Of course I can.

1447
01:09:50,565 --> 01:09:52,499
Oh, no, no.

1448
01:09:52,667 --> 01:09:54,362
No, I...

1449
01:09:54,536 --> 01:09:57,004
I don't want these to be seen
by the general public.

1450
01:09:57,505 --> 01:09:58,733
- No.
- Good.

1451
01:09:58,907 --> 01:10:00,204
That's a load off my mind.

1452
01:10:02,010 --> 01:10:04,706
That's a first-class photo, Turner,
technically speaking...

1453
01:10:04,879 --> 01:10:08,076
...but I don't think it's a suitable image.

1454
01:10:09,084 --> 01:10:10,915
- You don't?
- No.

1455
01:10:11,086 --> 01:10:12,678
I think it's perfect.

1456
01:10:12,854 --> 01:10:14,913
Perfectly brown.

1457
01:10:15,623 --> 01:10:17,113
It's you.

1458
01:10:17,292 --> 01:10:19,692
- Yeah, well, that's it. I don't...
- It's perfect you.

1459
01:10:19,861 --> 01:10:21,192
It looks... I look dodgy.

1460
01:10:21,363 --> 01:10:23,388
- You know what I mean?
- I know what you mean.

1461
01:10:23,565 --> 01:10:26,125
Yeah. We've gone too far.

1462
01:10:26,301 --> 01:10:29,634
He means we haven't really got
anywhere.

1463
01:10:29,904 --> 01:10:33,396
He means we've got to go
much further out.

1464
01:10:33,575 --> 01:10:35,873
We have to go much further.

1465
01:10:36,044 --> 01:10:37,568
Much further back.

1466
01:10:37,746 --> 01:10:39,646
And faster.

1467
01:10:40,548 --> 01:10:42,482
Wait a minute.

1468
01:10:46,821 --> 01:10:48,789
Are you all right?

1469
01:10:49,357 --> 01:10:50,654
Yes.

1470
01:10:50,825 --> 01:10:52,554
Yeah, I'm fine, thank you.

1471
01:10:52,727 --> 01:10:57,323
Look, what I've got to have
is a little photo.

1472
01:11:00,435 --> 01:11:04,496
I want a little black-and-white photo,
yeah?

1473
01:11:06,775 --> 01:11:09,938
Look, it's just gotta be
a little bit different.

1474
01:11:10,779 --> 01:11:12,440
Do you know what I mean?

1475
01:11:12,614 --> 01:11:14,844
In black and white.

1476
01:11:18,787 --> 01:11:23,156
It's nothing. It's what... The accident
what done me up.

1477
01:11:24,392 --> 01:11:28,852
You wanted a sort of passport size, eh?

1478
01:11:39,274 --> 01:11:43,438
It's interesting how things
grow quickly septic.

1479
01:11:45,346 --> 01:11:48,782
I think maybe we ought to call
Dr. Burroughs.

1480
01:11:49,517 --> 01:11:51,382
Give you a shot.

1481
01:11:53,221 --> 01:11:55,018
A shot?

1482
01:11:56,424 --> 01:11:57,652
No.

1483
01:11:57,826 --> 01:11:59,157
No.

1484
01:11:59,327 --> 01:12:01,693
You know what you're doing, Pherber.

1485
01:12:03,531 --> 01:12:07,592
I've gotta get... I've gotta get
this little photo just right.

1486
01:12:07,902 --> 01:12:09,893
What photo?

1487
01:12:10,071 --> 01:12:11,698
Of who?

1488
01:12:12,207 --> 01:12:14,038
Johnny Dean.

1489
01:12:17,178 --> 01:12:19,271
Maybe he doesn't know who he is.

1490
01:12:19,447 --> 01:12:20,937
He does.

1491
01:13:04,659 --> 01:13:07,685
He does. He knows. He's the bogeyman.

1492
01:13:07,862 --> 01:13:12,458
I'm alive and well.
You push the buttons on that thing.

1493
01:14:02,183 --> 01:14:04,242
We push the buttons.

1494
01:14:04,786 --> 01:14:06,083
He's the horror show.

1495
01:14:06,854 --> 01:14:08,515
He's an old pro.

1496
01:14:08,690 --> 01:14:09,816
He can take it.

1497
01:14:10,258 --> 01:14:11,520
He takes it.

1498
01:14:11,693 --> 01:14:14,423
He dishes it out too,
bet your sweet fucking life he does.

1499
01:14:14,596 --> 01:14:16,621
He's a mean bastard.

1500
01:14:17,465 --> 01:14:18,864
I'm the Lone Ranger.

1501
01:14:54,035 --> 01:14:56,469
He's a striped beast.

1502
01:14:57,205 --> 01:14:59,935
You enjoy your work, eh?

1503
01:15:00,108 --> 01:15:02,201
You've got the gift.

1504
01:15:04,345 --> 01:15:07,041
- What's wrong with the lights?
- Yeah.

1505
01:15:07,215 --> 01:15:08,614
Artificial energy.

1506
01:15:08,950 --> 01:15:11,145
It's pulsating into the voltage.

1507
01:15:11,853 --> 01:15:15,220
The flame... Hey, man, hold it!

1508
01:15:19,761 --> 01:15:21,456
Yeah.

1509
01:15:22,196 --> 01:15:23,720
Yeah.

1510
01:15:27,168 --> 01:15:31,161
I've never seen that sort before.

1511
01:15:35,743 --> 01:15:38,143
It must be scorching hot.

1512
01:15:43,184 --> 01:15:45,118
This is a...

1513
01:15:46,821 --> 01:15:48,379
This is a very pretty table.

1514
01:15:50,992 --> 01:15:52,789
A very pretty table.

1515
01:15:55,496 --> 01:15:58,260
I've an idea, I'd like a...

1516
01:15:58,433 --> 01:16:00,560
How much do you want for this,
Turner?

1517
01:16:03,438 --> 01:16:06,601
America's a blinding place for nightlife.

1518
01:16:06,774 --> 01:16:09,174
He's on his way, that man.

1519
01:16:12,647 --> 01:16:14,740
How much did you give him?

1520
01:16:15,616 --> 01:16:17,447
Two-thirds of the big one.

1521
01:16:17,618 --> 01:16:19,711
That's insane. I can't make that scene.

1522
01:16:19,887 --> 01:16:22,185
You should have thought of that before.

1523
01:16:22,357 --> 01:16:24,325
Johnny?

1524
01:16:24,492 --> 01:16:26,255
Johnny?

1525
01:16:26,427 --> 01:16:27,985
You feel better, huh?

1526
01:16:28,162 --> 01:16:30,630
Yeah. Not bad, not bad.

1527
01:16:30,798 --> 01:16:32,663
Pretty sharp.

1528
01:16:33,167 --> 01:16:34,828
- Gotta get a shift on.
- Sure.

1529
01:16:35,002 --> 01:16:36,833
Where's Rosie?

1530
01:16:38,606 --> 01:16:40,335
We're gonna nudge that slag.

1531
01:16:40,508 --> 01:16:42,874
Don't you worry about that.

1532
01:16:43,044 --> 01:16:44,602
Johnny?

1533
01:16:46,381 --> 01:16:47,871
Chas?

1534
01:16:48,983 --> 01:16:51,076
- Yeah?
- Look at this.

1535
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:54,083
What a horrible-looking thing.

1536
01:16:54,255 --> 01:16:58,214
No, it's not. It's beautiful.

1537
01:16:58,860 --> 01:17:00,691
You had one for dinner.

1538
01:17:01,529 --> 01:17:03,019
Yeah?

1539
01:17:07,268 --> 01:17:09,702
- You've poisoned me!
- Look, don't be crazy.

1540
01:17:09,871 --> 01:17:12,305
- You poisoned me!
- No!

1541
01:17:12,473 --> 01:17:13,997
- Oh, don't be ridiculous.
- No, no.

1542
01:17:14,175 --> 01:17:16,575
- Just to speed things up.
- You've just been drugged.

1543
01:17:16,744 --> 01:17:19,042
I want to get a shift on.

1544
01:17:22,417 --> 01:17:25,011
I just wanna go in there, Chas.

1545
01:17:25,186 --> 01:17:29,816
You see, the blood of this vegetable
is boring a hole.

1546
01:17:30,491 --> 01:17:34,052
This second hole is penetrating
the hole of your face.

1547
01:17:34,228 --> 01:17:36,093
The skull of your bone.

1548
01:17:36,264 --> 01:17:38,562
I just wanna get right in there,
know what I mean?

1549
01:17:38,733 --> 01:17:41,133
- And root around like a mandragora.
- Am I going nuts?

1550
01:17:41,302 --> 01:17:42,792
Come on. You're beautiful.

1551
01:17:42,970 --> 01:17:45,268
We just dismantled you a little bit,
that's all.

1552
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:47,169
Just to see how you function.

1553
01:17:47,341 --> 01:17:50,538
We sat through your act.
Now you're gonna sit through ours.

1554
01:17:50,711 --> 01:17:52,008
His act?

1555
01:17:52,180 --> 01:17:55,581
- They never get fed up with it, do they?
- I'm a goer, myself.

1556
01:17:55,750 --> 01:17:58,719
It's been on the road a million years.

1557
01:17:58,886 --> 01:18:02,686
A million years people have been coming
and dragging in to watch it.

1558
01:18:03,357 --> 01:18:05,951
I like a bit of a cavort.

1559
01:18:06,127 --> 01:18:08,687
I don't send them solicitors' letters.

1560
01:18:08,863 --> 01:18:11,798
I apply a bit of pressure.

1561
01:18:12,133 --> 01:18:14,567
He won't listen to me.

1562
01:18:14,735 --> 01:18:16,930
I know how you do it.

1563
01:18:18,639 --> 01:18:22,598
I know a thing of two about performing,
my boy, I can tell you.

1564
01:18:25,580 --> 01:18:28,014
He had the gift too, once upon a time.

1565
01:18:28,182 --> 01:18:29,945
You should have seen him 10 years ago.

1566
01:18:30,117 --> 01:18:31,744
I'll tell you this.

1567
01:18:32,253 --> 01:18:36,349
The only performance that makes it,
that really makes it...

1568
01:18:36,524 --> 01:18:40,426
...that makes it all the way,
is the one that achieves madness.

1569
01:18:40,595 --> 01:18:42,620
Right? Am I right?

1570
01:18:42,797 --> 01:18:45,231
- You with me?
- I'm with you.

1571
01:18:45,399 --> 01:18:48,300
He wants to know why your show...

1572
01:18:48,469 --> 01:18:52,735
...is a bigger turn-on than his ever was.
- How should I know?

1573
01:18:54,575 --> 01:18:58,841
Well, I know a thing or two
about the clientele.

1574
01:19:02,049 --> 01:19:05,018
They're a bunch of liars and wrigglers.

1575
01:19:05,186 --> 01:19:07,245
Put the frighteners on them.

1576
01:19:08,289 --> 01:19:10,416
Give them a bit of stick.

1577
01:19:11,592 --> 01:19:13,890
That's the way to make them jump.

1578
01:19:14,061 --> 01:19:15,289
They love it.

1579
01:19:15,463 --> 01:19:17,431
Always on a bummer.

1580
01:19:20,801 --> 01:19:22,166
Time for your new image.

1581
01:19:22,336 --> 01:19:25,965
- So is it different?
- Now we're getting somewhere.

1582
01:19:26,140 --> 01:19:28,040
America's a blinding place.

1583
01:19:28,609 --> 01:19:30,042
Must you really go tomorrow?

1584
01:19:31,412 --> 01:19:35,542
Tomorrow. Tomorrow he learns
what's true and what's not.

1585
01:19:35,716 --> 01:19:37,684
Nothing is true.

1586
01:19:37,852 --> 01:19:40,047
Everything is permitted.

1587
01:19:43,224 --> 01:19:46,318
The last words
of the old man in the mountain.

1588
01:19:47,028 --> 01:19:50,020
His motto. It's a thousand years old.

1589
01:19:51,465 --> 01:19:55,026
Imagine yourself being
a thousand years younger.

1590
01:19:57,305 --> 01:19:59,967
"The old man was called,
in the language of Persia...

1591
01:20:00,141 --> 01:20:01,665
...Hassan-i-Sabbah.

1592
01:20:01,842 --> 01:20:04,811
And his people were called
the Hashishin.

1593
01:20:04,979 --> 01:20:07,140
He had caused a valley
between two mountains...

1594
01:20:07,315 --> 01:20:10,341
...to be enclosed
and turned it into a garden...

1595
01:20:10,518 --> 01:20:15,182
...so large and beautiful
his people believed it was paradise.

1596
01:20:15,356 --> 01:20:20,760
And there was a fortress at the entrance,
strong enough to resist all the world.

1597
01:20:20,928 --> 01:20:23,954
Now, the old man who caused
those of his young men...

1598
01:20:24,131 --> 01:20:26,565
...whom he had chosen
to be his Hashishin...

1599
01:20:26,734 --> 01:20:32,900
...his assassins, to be given a potion
to cast them into a deep sleep.

1600
01:20:33,074 --> 01:20:34,837
And to be carried into the garden...

1601
01:20:35,009 --> 01:20:39,070
...so that when they awoke
they believed they were in paradise.

1602
01:20:39,246 --> 01:20:41,976
And there were damsels
and young girls there...

1603
01:20:42,149 --> 01:20:44,583
...who dallied with them
to their hearts' content...

1604
01:20:44,752 --> 01:20:48,483
...so that they had
what young men desire.

1605
01:20:49,323 --> 01:20:51,382
Thus it was,
that when the old man decided...

1606
01:20:51,559 --> 01:20:53,789
...to send one of his assassins
upon a mission...

1607
01:20:53,961 --> 01:20:55,895
...such as to have a prince slain...

1608
01:20:56,063 --> 01:20:58,531
...he would send for one
of these youths and say:

1609
01:20:58,699 --> 01:21:00,394
'Go thou and kill...

1610
01:21:00,568 --> 01:21:04,561
...and when thou returnest
my angels shall bear thee into paradise.

1611
01:21:04,739 --> 01:21:07,503
And shouldest thou die, nevertheless...

1612
01:21:07,675 --> 01:21:12,203
...I will send my angels
to carry you back into paradise."'

1613
01:21:12,380 --> 01:21:14,507
Enjoy doing work?

1614
01:21:16,617 --> 01:21:18,778
Are you in that garden?

1615
01:21:18,953 --> 01:21:20,284
Yeah.

1616
01:21:20,454 --> 01:21:22,820
Stay there.

1617
01:21:22,990 --> 01:21:27,086
Never trust old men,
old showmen, old wankers.

1618
01:21:27,762 --> 01:21:30,253
I'm gonna take you down the riverside.

1619
01:21:30,431 --> 01:21:32,126
I might powder you.

1620
01:21:32,299 --> 01:21:37,396
I might polish you.
I might make you shiny like a mirror.

1621
01:21:37,738 --> 01:21:39,797
I just don't know.

1622
01:21:41,075 --> 01:21:43,737
What's that? What do you call it?

1623
01:21:43,911 --> 01:21:45,503
Pectoral.

1624
01:21:49,383 --> 01:21:51,374
Do you like my physique?

1625
01:21:52,887 --> 01:21:54,047
Yeah, it's in...

1626
01:21:55,623 --> 01:21:57,352
It's in good condition.

1627
01:22:03,197 --> 01:22:05,392
I've got two angles.

1628
01:22:05,566 --> 01:22:07,397
One male and one female.

1629
01:22:07,568 --> 01:22:10,230
Just like a triangle, see?

1630
01:22:11,605 --> 01:22:14,335
- Did you notice?
- Aye.

1631
01:22:15,042 --> 01:22:17,203
Did you never have a female feel?

1632
01:22:18,579 --> 01:22:21,980
No, never. I feel like a man.

1633
01:22:22,149 --> 01:22:24,174
A man all the time.

1634
01:22:24,351 --> 01:22:25,784
That's awful.

1635
01:22:25,953 --> 01:22:28,080
That's what's wrong with you,
isn't it?

1636
01:22:28,255 --> 01:22:29,552
What do you mean?

1637
01:22:29,724 --> 01:22:32,215
It's a man's man's world.

1638
01:22:32,393 --> 01:22:34,861
There's nothing wrong with me.

1639
01:22:35,029 --> 01:22:36,792
I'm normal.

1640
01:22:43,804 --> 01:22:46,432
How do you think
Turner feels like, huh?

1641
01:22:46,607 --> 01:22:48,871
I don't know, he's weird.

1642
01:22:49,043 --> 01:22:50,943
And you're weird.

1643
01:22:51,345 --> 01:22:54,746
- You're kinky.
- He's a man. Male and female man.

1644
01:22:55,282 --> 01:22:57,307
And he feels like me.

1645
01:22:57,485 --> 01:22:59,578
- No. No, he doesn't.
- How do I feel, huh?

1646
01:22:59,754 --> 01:23:02,655
Tell me. Female feel.

1647
01:23:04,358 --> 01:23:05,723
You love it.

1648
01:23:05,893 --> 01:23:07,383
Come inside my squares.

1649
01:23:07,561 --> 01:23:11,622
I'll introduce you to Eek, the light god.

1650
01:23:11,799 --> 01:23:15,064
But be fast and change
your beautiful dress...

1651
01:23:15,236 --> 01:23:18,501
...or my curiosity will go elsewhere.

1652
01:23:19,006 --> 01:23:23,033
Tell me, my gluteus maximus,
how does it feel like, huh?

1653
01:23:23,210 --> 01:23:26,668
- I said I'm not one of those.
- Big butch.

1654
01:23:28,649 --> 01:23:30,480
- Rita Hayworth.
- I said, no.

1655
01:23:34,588 --> 01:23:36,385
You're sick.

1656
01:23:36,557 --> 01:23:37,922
You...

1657
01:23:38,092 --> 01:23:40,583
You... You degenerate.

1658
01:23:40,761 --> 01:23:42,592
You're perverted.

1659
01:23:43,030 --> 01:23:47,262
- What's he wanna get out of my face?
- I'm gonna polish you.

1660
01:23:47,968 --> 01:23:49,526
The hole. The hole.

1661
01:23:49,703 --> 01:23:52,831
- What's he want?
- Maybe a little mirror.

1662
01:23:53,607 --> 01:23:56,337
- A little dark mirror.
- My mirror? No.

1663
01:23:56,510 --> 01:23:59,673
- A little dark mirror.
- No, he shan't. The thieving slag.

1664
01:23:59,847 --> 01:24:01,144
Listen!

1665
01:24:03,984 --> 01:24:06,544
He won't take it away, you fool.

1666
01:24:06,954 --> 01:24:09,320
He just wants to take a look in it.

1667
01:24:10,090 --> 01:24:12,149
He's stuck!

1668
01:24:12,326 --> 01:24:14,226
- Stuck!
- Why?

1669
01:24:14,562 --> 01:24:16,928
Why? Because he's lost his demon.
That's why.

1670
01:24:17,097 --> 01:24:19,895
- Yeah?
- Yeah, he thought he had it under control.

1671
01:24:20,067 --> 01:24:22,934
Juggling all those balls, millions of them.

1672
01:24:24,738 --> 01:24:27,206
Until one day he was looking
in his favorite mirror...

1673
01:24:27,374 --> 01:24:29,069
...admiring his image, see?

1674
01:24:29,243 --> 01:24:32,508
And when suddenly,
he saw it a bit too clearly.

1675
01:24:32,680 --> 01:24:38,380
And he was just a beautiful, little,
freaky, stripy beast, darling.

1676
01:24:38,552 --> 01:24:39,780
So he thought maybe...

1677
01:24:39,954 --> 01:24:42,184
Maybe it's time for a change, he thought.

1678
01:24:42,356 --> 01:24:46,486
Then immediately as he watched,
the image faded.

1679
01:24:46,660 --> 01:24:49,993
His demon had abandoned him.

1680
01:24:50,698 --> 01:24:52,290
- He was gone.
- Yeah?

1681
01:24:52,466 --> 01:24:55,299
He's still trying to figure out
whether he wants it back.

1682
01:24:55,469 --> 01:24:58,370
- He's gotta find it again.
- Listen, I gotta tell you something.

1683
01:24:58,539 --> 01:25:01,406
Go and tell Turner. He's waiting for you.

1684
01:25:02,309 --> 01:25:05,073
He's been waiting a long, long time.

1685
01:25:05,246 --> 01:25:07,612
You must be polite.

1686
01:27:03,397 --> 01:27:05,991
Right again. Me.

1687
01:27:06,967 --> 01:27:08,628
Me.

1688
01:27:09,603 --> 01:27:10,831
Me.

1689
01:27:11,872 --> 01:27:13,965
Do you call that equitable?

1690
01:27:25,986 --> 01:27:28,045
I like that. Turn it up.

1691
01:27:55,049 --> 01:27:56,380
It was Mad Cyril.

1692
01:28:11,832 --> 01:28:13,299
We've been courteous.

1693
01:28:38,459 --> 01:28:40,654
Let's have a look.

1694
01:28:40,828 --> 01:28:41,954
Let's have a look.

1695
01:28:42,529 --> 01:28:44,326
- Excuse me, but...
- Come in!

1696
01:28:44,498 --> 01:28:47,194
Take them off. Take them off!

1697
01:31:03,837 --> 01:31:05,361
Go and tell your agent.

1698
01:31:07,874 --> 01:31:09,273
Why? What time is it?

1699
01:31:09,910 --> 01:31:11,969
You forgot to phone your agent.

1700
01:31:15,616 --> 01:31:17,811
I... I forgot.

1701
01:31:17,985 --> 01:31:20,146
You forgot to phone him.

1702
01:31:20,887 --> 01:31:23,947
These two freaks
with shiny eyes like this:

1703
01:31:24,124 --> 01:31:26,092
And that guy like this:

1704
01:31:27,060 --> 01:31:29,824
You've been giving him a hard time,
haven't you?

1705
01:31:30,964 --> 01:31:32,261
Did you screw him?

1706
01:31:41,375 --> 01:31:43,366
Hey, what is this?

1707
01:31:43,543 --> 01:31:46,910
Do you want it? It's yours.
You can have it.

1708
01:31:47,080 --> 01:31:48,809
Yeah?

1709
01:31:48,982 --> 01:31:50,882
Is he a real gangster? Is he?

1710
01:31:51,051 --> 01:31:52,848
No.

1711
01:31:55,689 --> 01:31:57,520
You done me up.

1712
01:31:57,691 --> 01:31:59,659
I forgot, didn't I?

1713
01:32:01,695 --> 01:32:04,255
He's got my passport.

1714
01:32:04,431 --> 01:32:05,693
He's got my...

1715
01:32:05,866 --> 01:32:08,096
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Tony?

1716
01:32:08,268 --> 01:32:09,701
Hello?

1717
01:32:09,870 --> 01:32:11,303
Hang on.

1718
01:32:14,408 --> 01:32:18,242
- There you go.
- Hey, Tony.

1719
01:32:18,412 --> 01:32:20,539
Hello, pal. Where you been?

1720
01:32:21,181 --> 01:32:22,478
You forgot.

1721
01:32:22,649 --> 01:32:24,014
Oh, Christ almighty.

1722
01:32:24,284 --> 01:32:27,742
No, I had a bit of aggravation, Tone.

1723
01:32:27,921 --> 01:32:31,880
It wasn't easy. I've got the picture.
I've got it right here.

1724
01:32:32,059 --> 01:32:33,356
<i>Oh, that's great, great.</i>

1725
01:32:33,527 --> 01:32:35,256
Look, that ship.

1726
01:32:35,429 --> 01:32:38,830
It looks as if it's leaving tomorrow night.
Yeah, somewhere...

1727
01:32:38,999 --> 01:32:41,365
I just need the photo.

1728
01:32:41,668 --> 01:32:43,795
Yeah, well...

1729
01:32:43,970 --> 01:32:46,666
...you got to pick it up.

1730
01:32:47,074 --> 01:32:48,439
Yeah, let me think.

1731
01:32:48,608 --> 01:32:52,066
81 Powis Square, Notting Hill Gate.
He can come here.

1732
01:32:52,245 --> 01:32:54,713
<i>81 Powis Square, Notting Hill Gate.</i>

1733
01:32:55,048 --> 01:32:58,176
81 Powis Square, Notting Hill Gate.

1734
01:32:58,352 --> 01:32:59,512
Yes, Chas, yeah.

1735
01:32:59,686 --> 01:33:01,745
You'll pick it up at 9:30.

1736
01:33:02,456 --> 01:33:05,914
I'll pick it up at 9:30.

1737
01:33:07,227 --> 01:33:08,694
Are you all right, boy?

1738
01:33:08,862 --> 01:33:11,330
No, no, no, I'm all right, Chas.

1739
01:33:11,498 --> 01:33:14,023
I'm just feeling a bit tired, that's all.

1740
01:33:15,602 --> 01:33:17,399
Tony...

1741
01:33:17,938 --> 01:33:19,769
...I owe you for this.

1742
01:33:19,940 --> 01:33:21,430
<i>I'm going to miss you, Tone.</i>

1743
01:33:21,608 --> 01:33:23,803
Yeah, I'll miss you too, boy.

1744
01:33:23,977 --> 01:33:26,411
Well, good night.

1745
01:33:26,580 --> 01:33:28,377
<i>Good night. I'll call you at 9.</i>

1746
01:33:28,548 --> 01:33:30,846
- God bless.
- Thanks, Tone.

1747
01:33:32,419 --> 01:33:34,148
Thank you, Tony.

1748
01:33:34,321 --> 01:33:38,553
A wise head on...
Still on those young shoulders, eh?

1749
01:33:40,861 --> 01:33:42,954
So he forgot, did he?

1750
01:33:43,130 --> 01:33:47,032
Forgot but not forgiven, eh, Moody?

1751
01:33:47,734 --> 01:33:49,361
Pardon?

1752
01:33:50,170 --> 01:33:54,470
It's funny. Wouldn't you say
that was unlike him, Tony?

1753
01:33:58,645 --> 01:34:02,445
It's unlike him to forget
an important thing.

1754
01:34:10,891 --> 01:34:12,756
Why is he going to America?

1755
01:34:12,926 --> 01:34:15,258
Why? I don't know.

1756
01:34:15,462 --> 01:34:17,760
Place to go isn't it, for gangsters?

1757
01:34:17,931 --> 01:34:19,228
I don't think so.

1758
01:34:19,399 --> 01:34:21,424
He's going to get in
some bad scenes again.

1759
01:34:22,068 --> 01:34:24,434
He should go here. Look.

1760
01:34:28,208 --> 01:34:29,641
The mountains of Persia.

1761
01:34:30,043 --> 01:34:32,568
Yeah, maybe. Maybe you're right.

1762
01:34:32,746 --> 01:34:35,579
I'm sure there's some bandits over there.

1763
01:34:36,283 --> 01:34:37,409
- Don't you think?
- Maybe.

1764
01:34:37,918 --> 01:34:40,478
Yeah, I'll tell him.

1765
01:34:40,921 --> 01:34:42,582
I'll tell him.

1766
01:34:42,756 --> 01:34:44,656
Tell me something.

1767
01:34:44,825 --> 01:34:49,125
Do you think the mountains
would be improved without the bandits?

1768
01:35:14,921 --> 01:35:16,855
Oh, my God.

1769
01:35:20,827 --> 01:35:23,955
I feel like I've been
through a cement mixer.

1770
01:35:44,951 --> 01:35:47,715
- French, are you?
- Yes, I'm French.

1771
01:35:52,826 --> 01:35:55,260
You're a funny little frog.

1772
01:35:58,031 --> 01:36:00,397
- You've got small titties, eh?
- Yes.

1773
01:36:01,368 --> 01:36:03,734
Bit underdeveloped?

1774
01:36:03,904 --> 01:36:06,998
Yes. What does that mean?

1775
01:36:07,173 --> 01:36:10,768
You're very skinny.
Like a little boy or something.

1776
01:36:12,546 --> 01:36:14,844
Some have mistaken this.

1777
01:36:25,091 --> 01:36:27,389
Lousy morning.

1778
01:36:29,262 --> 01:36:31,753
This is for you. I found it.

1779
01:36:31,998 --> 01:36:34,364
- It's an amethyst.
- Yes.

1780
01:36:36,436 --> 01:36:38,461
It's a purple amethyst.

1781
01:36:38,638 --> 01:36:39,969
Yeah.

1782
01:36:44,077 --> 01:36:46,011
You can have this too.

1783
01:36:46,179 --> 01:36:47,874
This is a magic one.

1784
01:36:50,083 --> 01:36:51,607
Is it?

1785
01:36:52,852 --> 01:36:54,342
Thanks.

1786
01:37:01,628 --> 01:37:03,493
Pherber's got a visa.

1787
01:37:03,663 --> 01:37:05,756
They don't wanna give you a visa?

1788
01:37:05,932 --> 01:37:08,662
- No.
- Why not?

1789
01:37:10,637 --> 01:37:12,127
I don't know why not.

1790
01:37:12,305 --> 01:37:13,932
Because you're foreign.

1791
01:37:15,108 --> 01:37:17,235
He likes foreign birds, that Turner.

1792
01:37:17,410 --> 01:37:19,378
Maybe I go with you. Why not?

1793
01:37:21,815 --> 01:37:23,874
But I don't want to go to America.

1794
01:37:30,624 --> 01:37:33,684
I wish you'd be a bandit in Persia.

1795
01:37:33,860 --> 01:37:36,522
- What's your name?
- Lucy.

1796
01:37:45,472 --> 01:37:48,600
He's got talent.
He shouldn't have retired.

1797
01:37:48,875 --> 01:37:50,740
He should keep at it.

1798
01:37:50,977 --> 01:37:52,808
He's stuck.

1799
01:37:54,280 --> 01:37:56,840
Everyone know who he is still,
don't they?

1800
01:37:58,485 --> 01:37:59,918
He likes you.

1801
01:38:01,688 --> 01:38:03,656
Stay until tomorrow.

1802
01:38:05,191 --> 01:38:09,287
I can't. I got to go along in a little while.

1803
01:38:10,330 --> 01:38:12,560
I've got to go too.

1804
01:38:13,800 --> 01:38:16,462
Maybe Pherber will come with me.

1805
01:38:17,337 --> 01:38:18,804
For holidays.

1806
01:38:18,972 --> 01:38:20,530
In the mountains.

1807
01:38:21,174 --> 01:38:23,608
Oh, <i>merde,</i> shampoo.

1808
01:38:26,613 --> 01:38:28,979
It's upstairs in the bathroom.

1809
01:38:33,653 --> 01:38:35,348
I'll get it for you.

1810
01:38:35,522 --> 01:38:36,853
Thanks.

1811
01:38:53,973 --> 01:38:56,464
We've got to get off, Chas.
Harry's waiting for you.

1812
01:38:57,944 --> 01:38:59,172
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1813
01:38:59,345 --> 01:39:01,643
Some of the chaps come up
to see you too.

1814
01:39:01,815 --> 01:39:03,544
To see how you are.

1815
01:39:08,788 --> 01:39:11,279
Rosie, I've got to pop upstairs
for a second.

1816
01:39:11,925 --> 01:39:13,392
No.

1817
01:39:15,795 --> 01:39:17,592
We've not got time.

1818
01:39:17,864 --> 01:39:19,923
We've got to get down to the country.

1819
01:39:21,701 --> 01:39:23,225
We got time.

1820
01:39:23,403 --> 01:39:25,030
We got a minute.

1821
01:39:26,372 --> 01:39:28,897
Or else, you'll have to give it to me
right here.

1822
01:39:31,311 --> 01:39:32,801
Right here.

1823
01:39:35,548 --> 01:39:37,345
Won't you, Rosie?

1824
01:39:42,756 --> 01:39:45,782
All right. Make it two minutes.

1825
01:39:47,393 --> 01:39:49,953
You'll let me have the shooter
as soon as you come down.

1826
01:39:50,130 --> 01:39:51,529
Right?

1827
01:39:53,700 --> 01:39:55,031
Right.

1828
01:39:58,605 --> 01:40:01,438
There's a couple of chaps
on the roof, Chas.

1829
01:40:01,941 --> 01:40:03,602
A couple in the garden.

1830
01:40:22,762 --> 01:40:24,320
I've got to be off now.

1831
01:40:24,497 --> 01:40:26,829
No, I'm gonna talk to you some more.

1832
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:28,433
No, I gotta shoot off now.

1833
01:40:28,601 --> 01:40:30,899
I might come with you then.

1834
01:40:58,231 --> 01:41:00,665
You don't know where I'm going, pal.

1835
01:41:03,336 --> 01:41:04,963
I do.

1836
01:41:43,643 --> 01:41:45,270
I don't know.

1837
01:41:50,250 --> 01:41:52,150
Yeah, you do.

1838
01:42:29,822 --> 01:42:31,517
Chas.

1839
01:42:35,028 --> 01:42:36,359
Chas.

1840
01:43:46,265 --> 01:43:47,755
Hello, Chas.

1841
01:45:34,707 --> 01:45:36,698
