1
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,331
I'm about to tell you what does matter.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:09,618
You're about to listen
like your life depended on it.

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:14,854
A month ago, an undercover
officer was murdered off West Grand.

4
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:18,376
They beat him up, put a gun to his head
and put a bullet through it.

5
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,532
I don't want to hear about
what you don't know or didn't do.

6
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:25,693
You ain't got the nut sack
for that size. You didn't kill him.

7
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:29,649
His name was Michael Calvess.
Take a gander at that.

8
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,449
Hold on a minute. You
motherfuckers come up in my crib.

9
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:35,929
Throw hot sauce
and blind my fucking ass.

10
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,773
- Want me to help you?
- Street name Jimmy Fredericks.

11
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,896
I know you know him.

12
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:42,334
My bets.

13
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,379
I know this motherfucker.
I might have let him suck on my dick.

14
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:49,896
You want to be bounced
back to County, keep it up.

15
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,733
I'll have you
braiding some nigger's hair.

16
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,253
Piece of shit!

17
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,251
Fuck. I think I'm bleeding.

18
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,536
Act like a punk,
you gonna get played like one.

19
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:02,693
Listen very carefully. They found
smack at the murder scene.

20
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:07,695
You took some of the same stuff ten
months ago. It nearly killed your ass.

21
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,658
You don't have the chemistry
or the sense God gave goats.

22
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,776
You didn't do the cook.

23
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,659
Dowd is dead. Who sold to you?

24
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,498
Whatever.

25
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,128
You gonna tell us? No?

26
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:25,938
You're a fucking smart ass.
We're tossing every inch of this place.

27
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:34,535
- Where is it?
- Where is it?

28
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:39,410
Oh my God. This must be one of
those refrigerator safes that locks.

29
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,695
What's all this?

30
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,899
Bagels and guns. What do you know?

31
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:54,530
- Tell us. Who sold you?
- Come on. Fuck all this shit.

32
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:01,817
You're unbelievably so dumb.
Are you kidding me?

33
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:06,098
This is the last time
I'm going to ask you. Who sold you?

34
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,978
I don't know.

35
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,011
- It was Darnell.
- He's got a cop ID.

36
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,574
It's got a shield.

37
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,211
You all right?

38
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,940
Let me see. Where you hit, neck?

39
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,014
Let me call it in.

40
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:45,014
I'll call the paramedics.
Hang in there. I'll be right back.

41
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:20,253
...I've used a mild sedative for him.

42
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:25,210
But I'm worried about
his history of drug abuse.

43
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:29,658
I need to go and pick up my son,

44
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:32,778
but I'm going to be back.

45
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,049
He didn't do it.

46
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:40,293
I don't know if you're not listening or
you don't want to, but he didn't do it.

47
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:43,657
We've compiled enough evidence
to support the contrary.

48
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:46,698
What does that mean?
What evidence?

49
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,054
We're closing it.

50
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,893
There's no way
Sheps killed Calvess.

51
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,210
If you're closing because of that,
you're way off.

52
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,211
Neither of us believe he did it.

53
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:58,099
He didn't have the capabilities,
the cold blood.

54
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,091
This guy did not do it.

55
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:03,935
He had no compunction when
faced with arrest for trying to kill you.

56
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,694
This is someone of
questionable mental stability.

57
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:09,658
- With a history of drug use.
- That you can pin motive on?

58
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,095
That can ride the rap after the fact.

59
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:16,139
You are jazzed up cos this piece
of shit we killed, Sheps, was white.

60
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:21,288
The racial card gets cooled and
you can forget about the dead cop.

61
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:22,688
Henry, ease off.

62
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:27,331
We initiated and backed this effort
from the very beginning.

63
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,732
Irrefutable is the following. A
known criminal with over 40 offences.

64
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:35,779
A drug tie linking him to Calvess,
in possession of stolen weapons,

65
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:39,655
narcotics and identification
belonging to another slain officer.

66
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,857
Richard Tekulve
was stabbed three years ago.

67
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:46,854
Homicide got a confession
and conviction. That's irrelevant.

68
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:50,456
- It denotes illicit criminal activity.
- This is unbelievable.

69
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:53,692
Sheps came into possession
of the ID as a result of

70
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,892
participation in the murder
or association with the murderer.

71
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,051
This guy was
105 pounds soaking wet.

72
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,051
The injuries that Calvess sustained

73
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:04,496
only could've come from two men
of considerably more strength.

74
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:07,618
That's not even taking into account,
there's no murder weapon.

75
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:10,089
What are we talking about?

76
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:14,179
This matter is no longer mine,
gentlemen. I apologise.

77
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:18,492
- You're serious?
- It's the Commissioner of Police.

78
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:22,414
- That is so fucked up.
- Yes, it is fucked up.

79
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,411
This is so fucked up.

80
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,939
We're done.

81
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:33,098
You're so wrong, pal.
Fucking bullshit.

82
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,251
I'm sorry, Nick.

83
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,649
I want you to stop now.

84
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,731
This is done.

85
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,173
It's not.

86
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:11,090
It has to be.

87
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:16,974
You know I wasn't happy,
and that was fine.

88
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:22,252
But this is where I hit the wall
cos I've seen you like this before.

89
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:26,971
Before I was willing to put myself
through it, but I can't do it anymore.

90
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:32,089
We didn't get them.
We didn't get the guys that did it.

91
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,534
We fucking

92
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,218
didn't do it

93
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:40,053
cos we, I... I lost him.

94
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,173
I lost him.

95
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:46,332
You're running at this
for all the wrong reasons.

96
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:49,850
You think catching him
is going to make you less like them?

97
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:53,330
Purified, just like Calvess?
That's bullshit.

98
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:57,254
That's not what he was.
That's not what you are.

99
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,648
I love you. I do.

100
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:19,133
With everything that I am.
But I'm still going to leave.

101
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,896
I can't be with you like this.

102
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,493
I'm not trying.

103
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,491
I'm done trying.

104
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,533
Tellis, you've got
something on your desk.

105
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,458
Look at this.

106
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:38,090
- Where did you get a warrant?
- Friends where friends count.

107
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:40,854
I ran that name
Deacon gave us, Darnell.

108
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:45,650
Darnell Beery. Possession. His last
arrest was pulling a gun on an officer.

109
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:49,699
- Look who he was booked with.
- Eugene Sheps, Latroy Steeds.

110
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:53,210
Steeds nor Beery were never
questioned about Mike's murder.

111
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:57,055
'They all used to work at Titan's Auto.
It closed down six months ago.

112
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,892
'I want to check this place out.'

113
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,648
Hey!

114
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,093
Freeze!

115
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:59,058
Do not fucking move!
Do not move!

116
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,379
- Get down!
- Fuck you.

117
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,338
Fucking tried to blow my head off.

118
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,890
Is this Darnell?
Let me fucking see you.

119
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:19,939
Come on. We've got
some fucking shit to talk about.

120
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:24,218
Get me my lawyer. I don't see
no badge. I don't see no warrant.

121
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:26,974
I didn't do this shit, man.

122
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,373
You, shut the fuck up.

123
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:43,810
I'm Det. Lt. Henry Oak of the Detroit
Metropolitan Police Department.

124
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,494
This is Detective Sergeant Tellis.

125
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:50,454
We already know who you are,
which is why we are here.

126
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,251
You've been hiding from us
cos you killed a cop.

127
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:03,248
That cop's name was
Michael Calvess, Jimmy Fredericks.

128
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:11,012
I'm going to give you the opportunity
to come clean on this and confess.

129
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,616
If you choose in your limited wisdom,

130
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:18,090
to fuck around with me
and force my hand,

131
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:21,138
you're both going out of here in a bag.

132
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:25,138
Fuck that. What you're doing is illegal.

133
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,689
Give me my fucking phone call.

134
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:31,296
You need more than a phone call.
You've got a hell of a jacket.

135
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:35,294
Multiple counts. Assault, B & E,
felony possession, grand theft auto.

136
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:39,612
Add to that murder of a decorated cop
and you've fucked yourself for life.

137
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:42,089
I didn't murder no fucking cop.

138
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:47,737
I'm going to toss this place.
Anything you want to tell me?

139
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,094
No?

140
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:51,774
Fine.

141
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,054
This is next.

142
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:54,338
Whose ride is this? Yours?
This must be your car, Darnell.

143
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:57,657
Huh, Big D? Is this yours?
Give me the keys.

144
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:01,096
- Fuck this. No keys.
- Say "fuck you" again.

145
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,455
Say "fuck you" again to me.

146
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:06,690
Your ride? OK.

147
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,896
- Take us in.
- Going to fuck around with me?

148
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,493
- No.
- Huh?

149
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,571
No!

150
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,577
Fuck! No!

151
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,493
This ain't right, man.

152
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,258
Lieutenant!

153
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,332
Look at that.

154
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,893
Fuck.

155
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:58,172
You brothers throwing a coup?
You selling this shit to the Serbs?

156
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,938
Police issue.

157
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,380
That's from the impound. Let's hear it.

158
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:08,856
What you been doing? Huh, Holmes?

159
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:12,490
Been sneaking into the impound?
You're in a lot of trouble.

160
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,615
This is it.

161
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,618
This is Calvess' gun.

162
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,651
This is Mike's gun.

163
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,774
What are you doing
with a dead cop's gun?

164
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:38,012
Answer me! What are you doing
with a dead cop's gun?

165
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,693
Answer me!

166
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:43,409
I don't know nothing
about no dead cop's gun.

167
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,535
A police issue revolver.

168
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,338
It belongs to a slain officer.

169
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,536
- That was not in there.
- What?

170
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,692
- That gun wasn't in there.
- Shut up!

171
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:55,608
- What you fucking doing with it?
- That's bullshit. It's a throwaway.

172
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,696
- What?
- You planted that.

173
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,339
I planted it?

174
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,728
Blood on the barrel.

175
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,379
Dried blood on the trigger guard.

176
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,814
Who the fuck planted that?

177
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,089
Come on.

178
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,251
Listen to me.

179
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:12,969
You better get a groove going.
You're in a life and death struggle.

180
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,698
Right fucking now.

181
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,452
- My lawyer.
- What?

182
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:19,418
- I want my lawyer.
- There are no lawyers.

183
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:23,334
It's just me and you.
I am in your shit for the duration.

184
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,095
You planted that.

185
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:30,048
Say one more fucking thing.
Please say one more thing.

186
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:39,934
In the fucking trunk.
No, I didn't do it. In the trunk.

187
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,211
What did I tell you?

188
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,617
They get dumber every year.

189
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:53,974
Nice and easy.

190
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,779
OK? We'll get this over real quick.

191
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:01,092
You're going to tell me
loud and clear what happened.

192
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:07,699
Two months ago,
a walking tunnel off West Grand.

193
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:12,694
You found out
there was an undercover cop.

194
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,293
You confronted him.

195
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:18,055
You overpowered him
and you beat him.

196
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,490
You took his pistol off of him.

197
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:28,373
You took it. You pointed it in his skull.

198
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:31,373
You pulled the trigger and killed him.

199
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,179
He died instantly.

200
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,614
A fucking lie.

201
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,213
I lied?

202
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:43,770
Remember Jimmy Fredericks?
Look at him.

203
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:48,495
You fucking remember him?

204
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,412
He was a junkie.

205
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:53,333
What'd you say? He's a what?

206
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,331
- Junkie.
- You're bullshit.

207
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,253
We saw that motherfucker
three or four times a day.

208
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:02,459
You found out he was undercover.
You tried to sell him a bad score,

209
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:06,329
hoping it would kill him.
He didn't use it, so you shot him.

210
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:08,212
You're bullshit.

211
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:12,134
You dealing motherfucker.
Fuck you. I'm gonna kill him.

212
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,291
Where do you think
we got them cop guns from?

213
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:19,214
That motherfucker used to swipe it,
sell it and get high regularly.

214
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,013
He was a cop.

215
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,216
A cop you killed. He had a wife.

216
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:25,699
He had kids.

217
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:40,214
No, not like this. Stop.

218
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:45,297
We bring them in like this,
lawyers will crucify us.

219
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:50,095
Put them under duress,
this bust gets bounced at arraignment.

220
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:52,137
These two colour us Klan
and walk.

221
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:56,088
They fucking walk for good.
We're too close.

222
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:01,614
There's a kit in the car.
We get it, we roll prints off the pistol.

223
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:05,250
You grab it. I'm going to call a wagon.

224
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:07,980
No. Don't call it in.

225
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:10,451
We're going to get
the confessions on tape.

226
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,497
Then we call it in.

227
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:17,328
I want some time
alone with these two. OK?

228
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,334
All right.

229
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:23,293
But grab the kit, all right?

230
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:28,255
We've got conclusive guilt.
We've got the murder weapon.

231
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:31,298
It's top heavy for conviction.
I'll go upstairs.

232
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:35,373
I'll bag whatever evidence I can find.
Let them get their shit straight.

233
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:39,374
It makes no sense
to knuckle down on them right now.

234
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:50,535
A brief reprieve, all right?
So suck it up.

235
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,330
Why you gotta lock the door?

236
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:39,213
- Are things gonna get worse?
- Shut up.

237
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:41,854
If anything happens to my daughter.

238
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:45,456
- Look me in the eyes.
- I know you.

239
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:48,293
I know you way before this shit.

240
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,893
You killed Elvin.

241
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:55,340
- How do you know?
- How you think?

242
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,456
Calvess just blow his own game?

243
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,531
Blow his own spot, man?

244
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,696
What the fuck are you talking about?

245
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:04,738
Who snitched you out
to Dowd about being a cop?

246
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:09,176
Do you think
that shit fell out of the sky?

247
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:12,730
He came after you
after Calvess told him you was 5-0.

248
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,137
He's a cop. He's one of me.

249
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:19,895
What the fuck
you think we making this up for?

250
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:22,779
We ain't got nothing to gain.
They're both dead.

251
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:26,455
You think Calvess is
some kind of a fucking saint?

252
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:29,896
That's something
he's about the furthest thing from.

253
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:36,896
Listen to me. We have seconds.
Make every single one count.

254
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:39,574
Before he left, he yelled.
You said he knew who killed Calvess.

255
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:43,813
- What does that mean?
- Your fucking partner, Oak, is dirty.

256
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:46,289
- He's fucking lying to you.
- What?

257
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:50,169
- He's lying to you.
- What's he lying about?

258
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:53,696
About what went down
in that tunnel, who killed that cop.

259
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:56,328
Everything. Why you think
we still up in here?

260
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,575
He was there.

261
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,093
Where?

262
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,093
In the tunnel.

263
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:13,455
That morning, Calvess came around.

264
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:16,930
He wanted to get some get high,
six in the morning.

265
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:21,651
I told that motherfucker this shit better
be worth my while, some big money.

266
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:24,209
You knew him by his real name?

267
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:27,417
He came off for a couple weeks,
said his name was Fredericks.

268
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:31,573
- Jimmy Fredericks. Yeah, go.
- But he got strung out.

269
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:34,174
Turned straight bitch. Blew his cover.

270
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,898
You knew?

271
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:38,335
Everybody knew,
just like everybody knows

272
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,252
you and a handful of
motherfuckers was cops.

273
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:42,854
He kept us out of his reports.

274
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,897
Tipped us off
to who was getting raided.

275
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:49,372
- We kept him high.
- You said he supplied you with IDs.

276
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:51,337
With police IDs?

277
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:54,293
All kinds of shit. Badges, IDs, guns.

278
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,894
Whenever he had
no money, he'd trade.

279
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,891
What was his condition that morning?

280
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:08,336
He wasn't looking too good,
talking crazy shit.

281
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:12,698
'Hands looking shaky. We show up
in the morning. He's got no money.'

282
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:15,897
Nothing to trade.
What was I supposed to do?

283
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:18,130
I told him to fuck off.
I ain't giving him shit.

284
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:23,699
This motherfucker starts tripping,
talking he's gonna arrest us.

285
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:25,896
Take us in if we don't comp his ass.

286
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:28,016
Then Oak showed up.

287
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:36,089
- Where?
- On the other side of the tunnel.

288
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:38,057
Did he say anything?

289
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,498
No, man.

290
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:45,015
When we saw him, Calvess seen him.

291
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:48,889
This motherfucker just flipped.
Talking about arresting us.

292
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:52,211
- Reaching for his gun.
- What'd you do?

293
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,659
I hit him.

294
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:58,571
- Cos he's reaching for his gun.
- I ain't trying to get shot by nobody.

295
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:01,618
Especially no junkie
trying to be a cop.

296
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,617
- What then?
- He fell.

297
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:09,053
Latroy hit him in his face once.
I kicked him to keep him down.

298
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:12,496
We ran,
and then Oak started shooting.

299
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:21,933
- Lieutenant fired? How many times?
- Three, four times.

300
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:25,575
The lieutenant fired on you
three or four times, you didn't get hit?

301
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,970
Quickly, tell me what happened then.

302
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:42,099
When we was running,
we heard Oak yelling at Calvess.

303
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:44,569
What the fuck are you doing, Mike?

304
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,850
That's when he did it.

305
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:50,338
Did what?

306
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:52,894
That's when he killed him, man.

307
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:03,137
What did you just say to me?

308
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:06,212
Fucking Calvess was a junkie.
He blew his cover.

309
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:10,339
- Oak killed him.
- Give me a straight face and say that.

310
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:14,373
You think he ain't capable of that?
You think he ain't got it in him?

311
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:18,328
He see his partner strung out.
That motherfucker flipped out.

312
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:21,930
You guys think
this is my first walk in the park?

313
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,374
Huh?

314
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:27,089
You cop to selling to an officer,
assaulting an officer.

315
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:30,969
You won't cop to killing him.
You want to spin bullshit.

316
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:33,700
You fucking wasted him.

317
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,255
It's over.

318
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:39,093
- What?
- It's over.

319
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:41,933
It is over. It is fucking over!

320
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:46,933
I gave you a shot to set it straight,
Darnell, and you pissed it away.

321
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:50,331
Both you pissed it away.
All this shit coming down.

322
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,337
You brought all this on yourselves.

323
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,775
You must be suspicious.

324
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:01,170
If you wasn't, why you lock the door?

325
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,900
The only thing
you need to know about me

326
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:06,369
is I'm going to bag
the motherfuckers that killed Mike.

327
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:12,333
Where we grow up, you kill a cop,
they will crown you King Kong.

328
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:15,219
Ain't nobody here
talking about killing no cop.

329
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:20,215
Oak come in here trying
to stick this shit to some niggers.

330
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:22,940
He knows that anytime
you stick shit to niggers,

331
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:25,255
it's gonna stay stuck.

332
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:29,896
When did you find that gun in there?
That gun Oak found.

333
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:34,611
Calvess'. You were the first one in
that trunk. Did you see a brown bag?

334
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:38,813
No. It came up when your back
was turned. Don't you see?

335
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:45,529
Tellis, open the goddamned door!

336
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:50,534
Why don't you dust for prints
and we'll see whose come off of there.

337
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:55,296
I'll bet you all the prints belong
to Oak. He planted it. He put it there.

338
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:59,214
You got ten fucking seconds.
Play it back for the record, now.

339
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,929
Goddamnit. Open the door.

340
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:11,133
Tellis!

341
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:19,488
What the fuck was going on in there?
Why'd you lock me out?

342
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,013
I asked you a question.

343
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:24,490
Were you tailing Calvess
the day he was killed?

344
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:26,332
You heard me.

345
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:30,175
Did he compromise his cover,
and were you tailing him as a result?

346
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,699
You talked to them?

347
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:34,294
The Mossberg off the floor.

348
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:37,213
Tekulve's ID and badge.
You heard them.

349
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:41,134
They're claiming Calvess supplied
them with police issue for junk.

350
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:45,088
- Can you explain that?
- How long after I left

351
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:49,736
did you let those liberal stirrings
in you spill all over the floor?

352
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:53,011
I don't like where you put me
to ask these questions.

353
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:55,774
Were you following him?
It's not an indictment.

354
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:58,135
If you did, I need to know now.

355
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:02,652
No,

356
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:05,129
I was not tailing him.

357
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:08,370
But you were there before he died.

358
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:13,051
You were there.
Tell me I'm wrong.

359
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:17,129
You want to fucking talk?

360
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,933
We'll talk.

361
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:33,577
Mike was making a bust that morning.
He had enough to make an arrest.

362
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:36,092
He needed backup.

363
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:38,455
- Off roster.
- Why?

364
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,736
He wanted to bring them
in on his own.

365
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:44,813
So I stayed back. I waited.

366
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:47,769
And the buy went bad.

367
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:51,219
How come you couldn't identify
those guys in there?

368
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:53,575
Because they shot him and ran.

369
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:57,574
They shot him or you shot them
as they fled the scene?

370
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:02,689
What? What did they say to you?

371
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:10,968
'Oak started shooting.
He shot Calvess. He killed Calvess.'

372
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:17,533
You must be out of your mind.

373
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:21,375
Much as he meant to me, you call up
my integrity, my commitment.

374
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:25,328
You're going to let
these pieces of shit smear that?

375
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:27,337
We're bringing them in.

376
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:31,294
You're fucking with something
you can't possibly understand.

377
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:36,096
I'm taking them in. It's over now.

378
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:38,137
Joke. You know that?

379
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:40,530
You're a fucking joke.

380
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:43,939
Your whole career's a joke.

381
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:47,378
A complete washout.
You popped that needle freak.

382
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:52,250
In the process you hit that woman
with a stray bullet, costing her a baby.

383
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,773
Enough!

384
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,168
Stop!

385
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:58,252
- Shut the fuck up!
- You're a lie.

386
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:00,172
You fucking lie.

387
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:06,529
I got this from child welfare.

388
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:09,573
Kathryn Tunney.

389
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:12,055
Mother deceased.
Removed from the custody

390
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:14,780
of her stepfather,
Myron Cobb, November 1985.

391
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:17,374
Placed with foster parents.

392
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:20,458
Did you know
that little girl, Lieutenant?

393
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:26,091
I think you do.

394
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:39,491
I've seen the records till she was 18.
I know you wanted to adopt her.

395
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:42,936
She was in and out of trouble,
in and out of foster homes.

396
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:47,457
Handful of arrests, drug-related.
You had them squashed.

397
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:49,770
You bailed her out of rehab.

398
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:53,091
You needed a doctor
to sign the release.

399
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:55,296
Who did it? Your old pal, Harlan.

400
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:59,419
He signed her out of those clinics.
I saw the signatures.

401
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:05,899
You made sure Harlan
was the active ME on Calvess.

402
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:09,370
Calvess?
I thought we were closing that.

403
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:14,375
So he could doctor the autopsy, alter
the lab reports, make them look clean.

404
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:19,335
Make Calvess look clean.
He's as dirty as you.

405
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:22,532
A filthy, fucking, needle-ridden junkie.

406
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:29,259
And you fucking knew it,
you motherfucker.

407
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:33,859
I'm calling this in right now.

408
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:45,890
Your gun and your shield
on the ground, now.

409
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:52,174
I am so far from fucking with you.

410
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:56,697
- You threatening my life?
- I'm going to take your life.

411
00:33:56,860 --> 00:34:00,899
- Gun and shield on the ground.
- You're a fucking lie.

412
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:04,770
You wanted me to back your bullshit.

413
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:07,295
Sell your story
so you could railroad those pricks.

414
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:20,738
You pulled her out of all that shit.

415
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:23,778
You couldn't afford
to break her heart again.

416
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:35,937
I get it, man. I get it.
He was a fucking addict.

417
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:38,370
How long before
he'd start pimping her out?

418
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:49,053
Hopeless, right?
Everything he did was hopeless.

419
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:54,851
You took this case
so you could bury it.

420
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:57,614
Kill me just like you killed him.

421
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:00,813
Come on, buddy.

422
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:04,290
I'm going back in there
and finish this up.

423
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:06,212
Come on.

424
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:07,449
Go home.

425
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:30,495
Bullshit's over. You destroyed his life,
his family. You fucked it all up.

426
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:35,648
So now you two are
going to tell me that you killed him.

427
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:08,293
He identified himself,
attempted to make an arrest.

428
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,893
You overpowered and shot him.

429
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:14,336
Say it.
Say it and you get out of here.

430
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,895
You think I'm fucking with you?

431
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:31,298
Ready to talk?

432
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:38,132
This is Calvess' gun.

433
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:41,292
This is the gun you used to kill him.

434
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:44,611
See it? Take it.
Take it in your hand.

435
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,019
Grip the gun.

436
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:56,293
You are going to tell me.

437
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:59,617
I've got two bullets left.
One for this head.

438
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:02,453
Lieutenant, drop your weapon!

439
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:07,895
I will shoot you where you stand.

440
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:10,096
I killed Calvess.

441
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:12,253
Shut up.

442
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,411
I killed Calvess.

443
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:38,895
Don't you leave me with this.
I need to know.

444
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:43,531
There was no bust. You were there
to kill him. That's what you did.

445
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,691
You knew what he was.

446
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:49,051
You planted the gun
cos he was a junkie.

447
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:53,930
You killed him. You've got to tell me
that. Look me in the eyes and tell me.

448
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:56,614
- They ruined him.
- Who?

449
00:37:56,780 --> 00:38:00,409
They made him that way.
They made him a junkie.

450
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:04,295
The department. It takes everything.

451
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:08,214
The pension, everything.
The family gets nothing.

452
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:10,172
Kathy gets nothing.

453
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:16,771
It's not that way. Tell me the truth.
Tell me the fucking truth.

454
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:20,458
Look at me.

455
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:24,329
Do not fucking go. Tell me.

456
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:08,088
- Give me the gun.
- What the fuck are you doing here?

457
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:12,333
What the fuck you doing? I'm taking
you out and getting you help.

458
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:15,611
I don't want help.
You are not taking me anywhere.

459
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:17,691
I'm not going out.

460
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:21,176
Do you have any idea
what you're doing to Kathy?

461
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:24,457
To the girls?
You know what they mean to me?

462
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:28,499
You're pissing away
your entire life. I won't have it.

463
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:31,811
I heard about this
and I waited. I ignored it.

464
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:35,893
Why Kathy didn't tell me,
I have no idea. But that's it. It's over.

465
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:39,530
I'm sorry I took
so goddamn long, but it's over.

466
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:03,298
Oh, my God.

467
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,611
Oh, my God, Mike.

468
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,528
Mike.

469
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:18,652
Mike...

470
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:21,452
Mike.

471
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:54,090
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry.

472
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:56,296
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.
