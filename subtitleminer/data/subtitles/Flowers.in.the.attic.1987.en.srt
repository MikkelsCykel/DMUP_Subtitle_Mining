FLORES IN THE LOFT

2
00:00:39,227 --> 00:00:40,808
<i > the Grandmother's House < /i>

3
00:00:43,425 --> 00:00:46,044
<i > Although many years have passed,
since I saw it for it finishes time < /i>

4
00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:49,819
<i > I cannot forget
that my first impression < /i>

5
00:00:50,152 --> 00:00:52,975
<i > it was of fear and of admiration.

6
00:00:55,438 --> 00:00:57,698
<i > There it would lose my childhood...

7
00:00:58,103 --> 00:00:59,949
<i >...my innocence made serious pieces < /i>

8
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:03,560
<i >...and all our dreams
destroyed...

9
00:01:03,583 --> 00:01:05,188
<i >...for what we would find
there inside.

10
00:02:15,353 --> 00:02:18,818
<i > My mother and father were for my
the center of the Universe when it was young < /i>

11
00:02:19,392 --> 00:02:22,092
<i > AND he/she dreamt of becoming bigger
to be the same as my mother.

12
00:02:27,168 --> 00:02:29,415
<i > we were a very united family.

13
00:02:29,918 --> 00:02:32,626
<i > I Remember like we received to Papá
when it returned home...

14
00:02:32,661 --> 00:02:34,110
<i >...after some of their frequent trips
of businesses.

15
00:02:34,643 --> 00:02:35,806
Be already here!

16
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,763
- He/she Calls to Cori and Carrie
- If

17
00:02:39,544 --> 00:02:41,998
- Let us go boys!
- Has dad arrived?

18
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,504
Quick, Already arrive!,
Let us go!

19
00:02:45,518 --> 00:02:46,861
We go, we go.
Agachensen

20
00:02:52,725 --> 00:02:54,704
Bend over Carrie that doesn't see you

21
00:02:58,183 --> 00:02:59,927
Dad!

22
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:10,308
<i > he/she loved Us to All, but it was
evident that I was their favorite one < /i>

23
00:03:17,264 --> 00:03:22,473
Not I want them to become jealous
if he/she waited that they went to the bed.

24
00:03:26,486 --> 00:03:28,320
You spoil me too much.

25
00:03:29,849 --> 00:03:31,455
Tell me if you like.

26
00:03:42,408 --> 00:03:46,017
Notice, it is also an alhajero.

27
00:03:58,694 --> 00:04:01,012
As soon as I saw it I understood
that he/she had to bring it to you.

28
00:04:19,151 --> 00:04:22,169
Mom
As you want him to place the candles?

29
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,047
I put 6 lines of 6
or 3 lines of 12?

30
00:04:25,278 --> 00:04:27,730
Or the 36 candles
around the Cake?

31
00:04:28,076 --> 00:04:31,111
And reason not two lines of 18?
Have not you been happened?

32
00:04:31,593 --> 00:04:37,548
I want to prove the Cake of Papá!
I want to eat up one of the circles!

33
00:04:38,048 --> 00:04:39,154
Allow me to take a bath the Mold!

34
00:04:39,386 --> 00:04:42,672
They are very beautiful both,
but we have to wait...

35
00:04:42,707 --> 00:04:43,784
...to sing him/her all to Papá
Happy Birthday.

36
00:04:44,929 --> 00:04:48,980
And we cannot eat a piece now
tiny, tiny?

37
00:04:49,645 --> 00:04:50,033
Please!

38
00:04:50,137 --> 00:04:52,049
They want him to seem that they have come
the ratoncitos to nibble it?

39
00:04:52,053 --> 00:04:55,013
It was very beautiful if I put
6 lines of 6.

40
00:04:56,381 --> 00:04:58,737
It is Papá!.

41
00:04:58,741 --> 00:04:59,443
Already this here. We go.

42
00:05:33,993 --> 00:05:36,737
NO!

43
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:51,637
<i > When dad died
He/she suckles it was very sad.

44
00:05:52,441 --> 00:05:55,266
<i > we Had to sell all that we had
to survive.

45
00:05:55,842 --> 00:05:58,529
<i > When we ran out of money
they removed us the house.

46
00:05:59,737 --> 00:06:02,132
<i > we were forced to abandon
the place in which we had been born.

47
00:06:02,784 --> 00:06:07,702
<i > Where all ntros were. memories
and the only home that he/she knew.

48
00:06:08,422 --> 00:06:11,212
<i > Mom said that alone we had
a place to where to go.

49
00:06:19,731 --> 00:06:22,771
And like it is that there were never us
taken to know the Grandparents?.

50
00:06:23,808 --> 00:06:26,592
Simply because there were not
ruined state.

51
00:06:28,364 --> 00:06:31,623
Many years ago I made something
that it displeased the grandfather a lot.

52
00:06:32,485 --> 00:06:34,578
And I punish myself disinheriting me.

53
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:39,141
Why we go now,
if they won't give us money?

54
00:06:40,134 --> 00:06:43,990
They will give it,
the grandfather you this dying.

55
00:06:44,809 --> 00:06:46,933
He has left very little time of life.

56
00:06:48,068 --> 00:06:50,848
I go resolved to recover
my father's affection.

57
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:58,485
And then children, I will be able to inherit
a fortune that you/they had never imagined.

58
00:07:00,164 --> 00:07:02,839
And through my, they will be able to carry out
all their dreams.

59
00:07:10,105 --> 00:07:12,724
Mom had to have us prepared
for a thing this way.

60
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:13,984
For that say it?

61
00:07:15,372 --> 00:07:18,693
It never allowed us to have a dog
or a cat.

62
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,474
And that that has to see?

63
00:07:22,834 --> 00:07:25,249
Simply that the animals die,
Christopher.

64
00:07:25,655 --> 00:07:29,092
And if has had a dog and you us
he/she had died, we would have learned something.

65
00:07:29,829 --> 00:07:31,840
On that,
About the death?

66
00:07:31,844 --> 00:07:33,703
If the death.
The death!

67
00:07:34,589 --> 00:07:38,151
Taenia that to have us said them, taenia
that to tell us that the parents also die.

68
00:07:39,889 --> 00:07:44,518
They die Christopher, although they are Young,
healthy and we need them.

69
00:07:46,277 --> 00:07:50,389
Not I want Christopher to be here,
and neither I want to go to the grandparents' house.

70
00:07:51,597 --> 00:07:55,279
I don't want to have a lot of money, and not
I care them not to be carried out my dreams.

71
00:07:56,632 --> 00:08:01,365
Me alone he/she wanted to continue living at home
and to always have with me potato's memory.

72
00:08:09,383 --> 00:08:12,965
Not I want to walk at night
he/she scares me.

73
00:08:13,027 --> 00:08:14,861
Has not reason sent us a car?

74
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:37,733
Here there are witches mom Witches and Monsters.

75
00:09:46,126 --> 00:09:50,176
Good Morning John.
Children introduce to John.

76
00:09:50,962 --> 00:09:54,083
He has been with your
grandparents since I have memory.

77
00:09:55,256 --> 00:10:00,140
They are Christopher and Kathy,
and the twins Cori and Carrie.

78
00:10:00,918 --> 00:10:03,531
Charmed of Knowing you John.

79
00:10:43,492 --> 00:10:44,768
Hello mother.

80
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:50,039
John was in charge of of his baggage Corine,
take you up to the children.

81
00:12:39,949 --> 00:12:43,555
It is 6 in the morning my love,
mom will also sleep.

82
00:12:48,896 --> 00:12:52,945
The children will sleep in one
room, Corine. The girls in another.

83
00:12:53,395 --> 00:12:56,033
But I want domir with Cori mom.

84
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:59,110
He/she stops to protest Young boy
and listen to me well.

85
00:13:00,162 --> 00:13:03,308
While they are it is this house
they will obey my you order.

86
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:07,184
Not they will scream, neither they will cry
neither they will form din.

87
00:13:07,896 --> 00:13:10,043
And when their mother and I come out of here...

88
00:13:11,119 --> 00:13:12,982
...we will lock the door.

89
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:16,819
Mom please understands that they are children!.
Not you can wait that...

90
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:17,887
The only thing that I wait is that...

91
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:21,744
...it is that they make what I am instructed.

92
00:13:25,248 --> 00:13:30,210
Listen a moment children, comportensen
odebezcan to their grandmother.

93
00:13:30,714 --> 00:13:34,310
And if they don't give him/her any, but any,
I motivate to punish them.

94
00:13:35,259 --> 00:13:40,081
Please, portensen well
make that they obey, let us make them to think...

95
00:13:40,179 --> 00:13:42,166
...that it is a game
or a wonderful adventure.

96
00:13:42,918 --> 00:13:44,660
Why do you cry mom?

97
00:13:46,418 --> 00:13:47,877
I will return inside a while.

98
00:13:59,711 --> 00:14:02,570
Don't worry, we will be well.

99
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:23,348
Not it can be so bad, the grandmother not
it should be as bad as he/she wants to look.

100
00:16:11,366 --> 00:16:17,779
Not forget that God the vé everything, God will see
all the bad one that they make to my backs.

101
00:16:18,049 --> 00:16:19,773
And it will punish them.

102
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:33,707
- Do they know why their mother came?
- Yes to recover their father's affection...

103
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,254
...and that it puts it in the Testament.

104
00:16:36,259 --> 00:16:39,439
And he/she has also told them for that reason
did the grandfather disinherit her?

105
00:16:40,493 --> 00:16:43,226
I want many to go to the bathroom.

106
00:16:43,345 --> 00:16:44,642
Silence!

107
00:16:45,844 --> 00:16:47,267
He/she learns how to control you.

108
00:16:48,066 --> 00:16:51,395
And I don't want you to speak never if I don't make you
a question.

109
00:16:52,225 --> 00:16:54,836
- But it is alone a boy.
- That I have just said?

110
00:16:57,723 --> 00:17:05,292
Their mother has come to this house after 17 years,
to regret their crimes and of all their sins.

111
00:17:05,721 --> 00:17:10,489
Not alone against their grandfather or against my,
but against God.

112
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:14,542
Their mother's impious fué marriage.

113
00:17:15,483 --> 00:17:17,332
A sacrilege.

114
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:20,711
An abomination before the eyes of God.

115
00:17:21,229 --> 00:17:23,844
It has not counted them that it made
the but terrible of the sins?

116
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:30,477
You hurtles to the arms of a man that
it took their veins, the same blood that her.

117
00:17:31,363 --> 00:17:40,076
Not he/she was a stranger, era their own Uncle
and you are the fruit of the Devil's seed.

118
00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:44,862
- Damned from the moment of their conception
- I will look for my mother!

119
00:17:47,426 --> 00:17:48,661
They come here

120
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:52,936
Sit down.

121
00:17:55,497 --> 00:17:57,749
Don't move again until I leave.

122
00:17:59,927 --> 00:18:04,965
I want that they know a thing, to their grandfather
he/she won't be said that they are here.

123
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:07,527
He/she will never be said.

124
00:18:08,178 --> 00:18:11,813
The not even knows that they exist,
none of you.

125
00:18:12,317 --> 00:18:14,861
Neither siequiera knows that they have been born.

126
00:18:16,362 --> 00:18:22,288
While the grandfather lives, I swear them that I will avoid him/her
by all possible means that it suffers this shame.

127
00:18:31,088 --> 00:18:34,907
I don't like this here Kathy
I want to return home.

128
00:20:00,355 --> 00:20:02,300
Mom!

129
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,963
Where you have been?
Where you have been?

130
00:20:14,299 --> 00:20:16,849
Mom that has spent?

131
00:20:17,646 --> 00:20:22,410
Coríne, I don't want screams
remain silent to your children immediately!

132
00:20:38,834 --> 00:20:40,852
Not leave it!

133
00:20:41,476 --> 00:20:42,524
Non Cori!

134
00:20:44,964 --> 00:20:46,709
Mom tells him/her that she stops!

135
00:20:47,738 --> 00:20:52,000
Corin, if you don't control your children, I will make them whip
until the blood runs for its backs.

136
00:20:52,858 --> 00:20:56,605
They are very not well educated and they have to learn
to obey.

137
00:20:57,212 --> 00:21:01,248
Any boy that alive under this roof
it will disobey me..

138
00:21:02,318 --> 00:21:05,273
Neither he/she will scream, neither it will provoke me!
have they heard me?.

139
00:21:07,071 --> 00:21:08,213
Have they heard me?

140
00:21:11,473 --> 00:21:14,733
And you...
Now take off the blouse daughter.

141
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:19,180
I want them to see like they are the punishments
in this house.

142
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,707
If you are cruel with my children
I will take them to me this same night.

143
00:21:22,904 --> 00:21:28,440
Take them to you Corín, take them to you right now
I don't care you to make it.

144
00:21:34,405 --> 00:21:36,220
Take off the blouse Coríne.

145
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:40,632
Take off it!.

146
00:21:47,204 --> 00:21:49,486
Fijensen well children...

147
00:21:49,487 --> 00:21:56,364
...17 lashes one for every year
that he/she lived in sin with their father.

148
00:21:57,824 --> 00:22:05,438
And I want them to know that will give them food
and I roof, but they will never have my affection.

149
00:22:06,849 --> 00:22:10,423
Since it is impossible to feel another thing
that it is not disgust.

150
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,021
For what is not healthy.

151
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:41,743
- I feel already better.
- If he/she had an antiseptic one.

152
00:22:42,399 --> 00:22:43,858
My young doctor.

153
00:22:45,996 --> 00:22:50,215
The years of happiness that I shared
with their Papá, they are worth for 100 lashes.

154
00:22:50,889 --> 00:22:54,766
The grandmother told us many things mom,
sew horrible

155
00:22:56,045 --> 00:22:59,378
They have mistreated you and the hate hence.

156
00:23:00,054 --> 00:23:06,960
The worst thing has already happened, starting from tomorrow
attempt you to go winning me my Father's affection.

157
00:23:08,082 --> 00:23:13,455
And if you help me, all help me
behaving well as I have told them...

158
00:23:14,409 --> 00:23:15,707
...I will get it.

159
00:23:44,222 --> 00:23:49,200
To the right of the closet there is a secret door,
look for it tomorrow morning

160
00:23:49,709 --> 00:23:54,089
Push it smoothly and he/she will open up,
they will see a narrow stairway that will take them

161
00:23:54,552 --> 00:23:58,991
to such a big Loft that they will get lost there inside.

162
00:24:00,085 --> 00:24:04,813
Make of him a place of games for the twins.
Make of him your special place.

163
00:24:22,041 --> 00:24:25,304
- Will you go to the bathroom?
- No

164
00:24:27,643 --> 00:24:29,549
Did you not even wash your teeth?

165
00:24:31,143 --> 00:24:32,969
Not I have I encourage of making it.

166
00:24:51,369 --> 00:24:52,882
That you say of all this?

167
00:24:54,419 --> 00:24:55,766
That the uncles that marry their nieces.

168
00:24:56,587 --> 00:24:58,703
That they have unsightly children with line.

169
00:24:59,696 --> 00:25:03,927
Your you will be medical,
Do you believe that it can be certain?

170
00:25:04,546 --> 00:25:06,264
We are the test.

171
00:25:10,136 --> 00:25:11,394
In that think?

172
00:25:11,688 --> 00:25:12,906
In Mom.

173
00:25:14,494 --> 00:25:17,084
As soon as it has changed a lot since dad died.

174
00:25:18,274 --> 00:25:21,590
Not it has changed...
this sad one.

175
00:25:22,211 --> 00:25:26,589
We are also he Christopher,
and we are the same ones.

176
00:25:57,175 --> 00:26:00,547
And if the grandmother enters before we wake up
and us vé in the same bed?

177
00:26:06,442 --> 00:26:08,423
- You are not him/her afraid?
- No.

178
00:26:11,246 --> 00:26:13,753
We have also always slept in the same bed.

179
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:56,445
I made a list of the norms that you/they should complete
while they live in this house.

180
00:26:57,288 --> 00:27:00,719
Read them attentively and record them in their minds.

181
00:27:18,321 --> 00:27:20,701
Take something of food, they won't want
to die there out from hunger.

182
00:27:22,092 --> 00:27:23,488
It is necessary to look for the stairway.

183
00:27:38,044 --> 00:27:40,764
- It is already.
- That you see Christopher?.

184
00:27:42,436 --> 00:27:46,124
From here you don't leave anything.
Alone the stairway.

185
00:27:50,052 --> 00:27:52,122
Are they prepared to ascend?

186
00:27:52,157 --> 00:27:52,971
NOT EVEN!

187
00:27:54,037 --> 00:27:59,534
To their mother he/she is authorized to tell them on the loft
but I want to remind them again...

188
00:27:59,649 --> 00:28:01,723
...that they should never be seen.

189
00:28:39,997 --> 00:28:41,716
My God!

190
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:38,135
<i > the grandmother's norms were not norms
they were cruel punishments.

191
00:29:38,576 --> 00:29:44,427
<i > we were caught. The only way to feel the sun,
it was alone to travez of a put bars on window.

192
00:29:45,118 --> 00:29:47,900
<i > Our mother taenia that to be despaired to have returned.

193
00:29:48,252 --> 00:29:50,301
<i > we All will pay the price.

194
00:31:15,776 --> 00:31:21,120
<i > The weeks months, the memory were made
of our true house he/she began to vanish...

195
00:31:21,181 --> 00:31:23,466
<i >...however we continued grasped
to our dreams.

196
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:28,638
<i > Chris dreamt of being medical,
and I wanted to be a dancer.

197
00:31:30,143 --> 00:31:32,154
<i > we were about behaving like a family.

198
00:31:32,633 --> 00:31:34,629
<i > it was the only form of surviving.

199
00:31:54,402 --> 00:31:59,445
<i > Mom was spacing her visits, and one day accent of coming.

200
00:32:00,287 --> 00:32:03,000
<i > we imagined that it had passed him/her something terrible.

201
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:05,373
<i > OR that he/she had forgotten.

202
00:32:06,615 --> 00:32:08,475
<i > it Seemed that we didn't have any possibility to escape...

203
00:32:08,971 --> 00:32:12,466
<i >...but soon, very soon we would have to find the form...

204
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:15,951
<i >...of deceiving the grandmother, to go in
it looks for and he/she helps of our mother...

205
00:32:16,586 --> 00:32:17,539
<i >...if we could.

206
00:32:26,758 --> 00:32:31,989
- Do you like this snail?
- I find that this beautiful one, is very beautiful.

207
00:32:32,863 --> 00:32:38,174
- I believe that it seems an orange
- Neither for I appear.

208
00:32:38,856 --> 00:32:41,514
I have never done an orange with tentacles.
Your if?

209
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:45,707
They are antennas Kathy, non tentacles.

210
00:32:45,742 --> 00:32:48,456
The snails pertecenen to the the family of the mollusks.

211
00:32:49,022 --> 00:32:54,130
They have the soft body, they lack thorn number,
and their tubular intentinos finishes in the mouth

212
00:32:54,693 --> 00:32:58,235
Dear Doctor Christopher,
when Cori and I want information...

213
00:32:58,284 --> 00:33:03,505
...of the snails, we will send him/her a telegram
to wonder it.

214
00:33:04,436 --> 00:33:06,786
That day we will leave out?

215
00:33:07,591 --> 00:33:11,450
- As soon as mom says it.
- But he/she suckles he/she no longer comes but.

216
00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:15,697
If we could leave to the garden we would have flowers
really, herbs really.

217
00:33:15,767 --> 00:33:17,733
And snails really.

218
00:33:18,295 --> 00:33:21,719
- God of it has taken them the whole herb to the sky.
- For that?.

219
00:33:22,162 --> 00:33:26,492
For potato, or they maybe forgot that
did he/she always spend it cutting the grass?

220
00:33:26,603 --> 00:33:29,592
Does reason always have to be in the loft?

221
00:33:29,909 --> 00:33:32,268
Because the house of below it has disappeared.

222
00:33:32,484 --> 00:33:33,800
That is not true Corí

223
00:33:34,013 --> 00:33:37,810
- Mom doesn't come because she doesn't love us
- Not say foolishness.

224
00:33:37,941 --> 00:33:39,081
Huy! It chops me...

225
00:33:39,533 --> 00:33:41,481
He/she suckles it is very bad, we want to see the television...

226
00:33:41,696 --> 00:33:44,565
...we want an ice cream, we want to play with our friends...

227
00:33:44,684 --> 00:33:46,046
...we want to leave to the street.

228
00:33:46,509 --> 00:33:48,979
- Do they want they want to go to the school?
- NO!

229
00:33:49,212 --> 00:33:56,095
Look at me, look at me both, the Bible says
that there is a time for everything.

230
00:33:56,804 --> 00:34:02,766
A time to grow, a time for
to sow a time to harvest...

231
00:34:02,849 --> 00:34:05,193
...and to take an ice cream...
for sure there is also a time.

232
00:34:07,112 --> 00:34:10,581
The time has arrived us of
to sacrifice us... for mom.

233
00:34:12,039 --> 00:34:15,419
We have todala life for before
to live and to have a good time.

234
00:34:32,037 --> 00:34:34,557
Can Kathy happen?

235
00:34:35,908 --> 00:34:38,268
He/she closes the door door for not waking up the twins.

236
00:34:52,181 --> 00:34:54,275
Something could pass mom...

237
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,760
...maybe this it makes sick.

238
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:59,225
Mom has always been strong
as a horse.

239
00:35:00,226 --> 00:35:02,045
Where this whole time has been?

240
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:04,845
Why has he/she stopped to come?

241
00:35:08,841 --> 00:35:10,618
I have had other thoughts...

242
00:35:11,536 --> 00:35:13,023
...terrible thoughts.

243
00:35:13,101 --> 00:35:16,412
- That?
- They can have contained it...

244
00:35:16,462 --> 00:35:18,345
...in some place of this great house.

245
00:35:19,146 --> 00:35:20,705
The same as to us.

246
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:24,769
- For what reason will they contain it?
- To punish her.

247
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:28,006
That you believe?. If they are totally crazy.

248
00:35:30,071 --> 00:35:33,922
- You scare me...
- I die from fear...

249
00:35:34,097 --> 00:35:35,216
...when I think a little.

250
00:35:38,054 --> 00:35:42,220
- For sure not this contained.
- As these so sure one?

251
00:35:44,841 --> 00:35:47,765
Does it care?
Not we will know the truth until...

252
00:35:47,819 --> 00:35:49,242
...that he/she comes to see us.

253
00:35:51,306 --> 00:35:52,377
Ah If?

254
00:35:55,679 --> 00:35:58,935
- That it is supposed that that means?
- I have a plan.

255
00:35:59,285 --> 00:36:02,129
- Christopher that you believe that these making?
- Don't worry.

256
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,224
Christopher!

257
00:36:04,408 --> 00:36:06,064
You woke up the twins.

258
00:36:11,417 --> 00:36:14,020
Carry, this it is not your bed.

259
00:36:16,594 --> 00:36:19,039
I want to sleep with Cory.

260
00:36:52,323 --> 00:36:55,050
Get up!
Leave the beds!

261
00:37:21,606 --> 00:37:23,423
Not you don't play it!

262
00:37:24,565 --> 00:37:27,298
No! it is dad's gift

263
00:37:36,622 --> 00:37:38,653
NO!

264
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:58,475
Tell me Christopher, these thinking of the form
of escaping, without the grandfather finds out?

265
00:38:00,041 --> 00:38:01,983
I have been thinking it for weeks, Kathy.

266
00:38:03,088 --> 00:38:04,863
Not I have been able to think of another thing.

267
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:06,836
Will we be able to make it?.

268
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:12,484
Christopher, if he/she suckles this here,
we have to find it...

269
00:38:12,485 --> 00:38:13,485
...we have to count him/her.

270
00:38:16,073 --> 00:38:18,075
We will make it... tonight.

271
00:38:43,673 --> 00:38:44,792
Help me Kathy

272
00:38:50,441 --> 00:38:51,990
He/she throws with force.

273
00:38:54,778 --> 00:38:55,826
He/she throws strong...

274
00:39:01,029 --> 00:39:02,757
He/she throws, Kathy throws.

275
00:39:35,449 --> 00:39:36,314
- I will lower with you.

276
00:39:37,004 --> 00:39:38,506
- Neither you think it.
- IF!

277
00:39:41,896 --> 00:39:44,526
Very well, but I will lower first.

278
00:39:44,832 --> 00:39:47,714
Not I want you to put the hands in the rope
until I have arrived below.

279
00:39:48,567 --> 00:39:49,632
Have you understood it?

280
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:51,716
Yes I have understood it

281
00:40:00,886 --> 00:40:02,345
Have much care

282
00:40:18,853 --> 00:40:19,916
Care!

283
00:41:27,944 --> 00:41:28,926
That?

284
00:41:32,402 --> 00:41:33,748
My God!

285
00:41:36,046 --> 00:41:38,467
It ascends...
Kathy ascends!

286
00:42:26,329 --> 00:42:28,387
Let us go, let us go!

287
00:42:38,548 --> 00:42:39,484
Let us go!

288
00:42:50,663 --> 00:42:52,801
Christopher!

289
00:42:53,452 --> 00:42:54,346
Kathy!

290
00:42:54,358 --> 00:42:55,837
Christopher!

291
00:42:58,974 --> 00:43:00,686
Let Us Go, Christopher!

292
00:43:09,137 --> 00:43:11,584
Date hurry, throw me the rope.

293
00:43:30,714 --> 00:43:32,949
Your you can, single scale!

294
00:43:35,912 --> 00:43:37,670
We Go Christopher.

295
00:44:24,463 --> 00:44:25,970
Mommy...

296
00:44:31,262 --> 00:44:32,561
Does he/she suckle?

297
00:44:40,711 --> 00:44:41,719
He/she is mom

298
00:44:45,137 --> 00:44:49,329
And I have a snail, Kathy has a
I siege to dance beside the window.

299
00:44:49,702 --> 00:44:52,433
I am amazed of seeing them.
I am glad a lot to see the very happy ones that are.

300
00:44:53,042 --> 00:44:55,819
We are happy of seeing you mom
but he are not be here

301
00:45:05,333 --> 00:45:09,147
Why have you been so much time without coming?
We were concerned.

302
00:45:09,394 --> 00:45:13,596
For that reason they did try to escape?
That they made, answer me.

303
00:45:14,966 --> 00:45:17,813
Not we sought to escape mom
alone we wanted to be.

304
00:45:17,831 --> 00:45:21,512
Were not they happened that they would ruin my plan?
Our plan..

305
00:45:22,817 --> 00:45:24,484
Not they do understand what I told them?

306
00:45:24,815 --> 00:45:26,982
- If they continue...
- The twins mom are not well.

307
00:45:27,046 --> 00:45:29,800
They need to leave so that he/she gives them the air.

308
00:45:29,883 --> 00:45:34,910
They need to play with their friends, they need space
free to run, and they need to return to the school.

309
00:45:36,733 --> 00:45:39,790
Very well..
We will make what you/they want.

310
00:45:40,593 --> 00:45:42,701
- We can leave now if they want..
- IF!..

311
00:45:42,737 --> 00:45:47,359
...or we can wait a little
until they read the testament.

312
00:45:49,443 --> 00:45:50,872
Is the grandfather dying?

313
00:45:51,977 --> 00:45:53,802
The doctors say that not
he/she has neither a month of life.

314
00:45:57,789 --> 00:46:00,810
If we leave now we won't have anything.
Not we will have to where to go.

315
00:46:01,484 --> 00:46:04,771
If we stay, we will have
but of what we always wanted.

316
00:46:05,178 --> 00:46:06,233
Forever.

317
00:46:07,964 --> 00:46:12,239
We love you mom.
What is better...

318
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:13,743
...it is it we will make.

319
00:46:15,827 --> 00:46:18,445
Would Kathy, like me to know that you say?

320
00:46:22,386 --> 00:46:24,107
It will be better than he/she will see the twins.

321
00:46:29,054 --> 00:46:32,834
Don't worry mom.
We will wait a little but.

322
00:46:33,771 --> 00:46:34,676
We will be well.

323
00:46:36,083 --> 00:46:37,059
Don't worry.

324
00:47:00,419 --> 00:47:05,205
I already have it, I already have it!
Christopher has a mascot.

325
00:47:06,391 --> 00:47:12,376
I am oppressed to fake before you Mr.,
because your ne hicistes to your image and likeness.

326
00:47:39,481 --> 00:47:42,234
Christopher comes to see what has happened.

327
00:47:48,183 --> 00:47:50,264
I believe that they have put but grills.

328
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:31,502
<i > Chris regretted to have
consented to mom's desires...

329
00:48:32,178 --> 00:48:33,671
<i > I found a form of escaping...

330
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:36,755
<i >...although alone he/she went to a bathroom in my fantasies.

331
00:48:37,506 --> 00:48:42,537
<i > Fantasies of a life full with parties,
friends, and perhaps even loves.

332
00:48:43,312 --> 00:48:45,485
<i > Fantasies that probably,
they would never be made reality.

333
00:48:53,605 --> 00:48:55,275
- Kathy
- If!

334
00:48:57,241 --> 00:48:58,559
Can I speak with you?

335
00:48:58,649 --> 00:48:59,675
That it happens?

336
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:02,824
Not you will be bothersome with me to have
leaning to mom, truth?

337
00:49:03,161 --> 00:49:06,242
- No, but because you always have
that to agree with her?..

338
00:49:06,339 --> 00:49:07,145
Sinners!

339
00:49:10,388 --> 00:49:13,522
- !Christopher
- That we have made so that he/she calls us sinners?

340
00:49:14,121 --> 00:49:16,591
We are all in the same room,
week after week...

341
00:49:16,675 --> 00:49:21,132
...and he/she doesn't want us to see each other.
You. it put us here. You. I close up us here.

342
00:49:21,921 --> 00:49:24,246
He/she wants to be making
something that this bad.

343
00:49:25,932 --> 00:49:30,129
He/she looks at your black dress, your wonderful jewels
and your face of bitter

344
00:49:30,955 --> 00:49:36,598
We are not you afraid, we laugh at tí
you hear it we laugh, it was, it was, veto!

345
00:49:49,297 --> 00:49:51,267
He/she suckles it didn't let him to happen to us anything.

346
00:49:54,501 --> 00:49:57,955
We will have to block the door
or to hide in the loft.

347
00:49:58,576 --> 00:49:59,802
Not it will ascend there.

348
00:50:01,566 --> 00:50:03,841
So afraid Christopher am.

349
00:50:05,763 --> 00:50:12,217
We will be well. He/she suckles he/she will be in charge of of it...
and me also.

350
00:51:04,739 --> 00:51:05,658
Cori?

351
00:51:12,332 --> 00:51:14,536
- That Christopher happens?
- Cori not you where it is..

352
00:51:16,561 --> 00:51:17,722
Cori!

353
00:51:23,471 --> 00:51:25,070
Cori!

354
00:51:25,268 --> 00:51:26,132
Where these?

355
00:51:28,553 --> 00:51:30,943
Here it is not, your you look for it over there.

356
00:51:31,897 --> 00:51:32,736
Cori

357
00:51:32,956 --> 00:51:33,737
Cori

358
00:51:44,102 --> 00:51:45,272
This here!

359
00:51:51,049 --> 00:51:53,398
Cori, Cori, Awake!

360
00:51:53,690 --> 00:51:54,440
He/she Wakes Up Affection

361
00:51:56,422 --> 00:51:58,450
Fred escaped

362
00:51:58,485 --> 00:52:00,572
I found difficult a lot to find it..

363
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:04,962
and where this fred?
This here with me.

364
00:52:06,053 --> 00:52:08,119
It will be better than Fred he/she sleeps below.

365
00:52:26,314 --> 00:52:27,054
Kathy!

366
00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:29,442
Kathy!

367
00:52:29,621 --> 00:52:31,743
Kathy
He/she opens the door

368
00:52:32,265 --> 00:52:32,924
<i > Kathy!

369
00:52:42,008 --> 00:52:44,468
You are a sinner

370
00:52:47,864 --> 00:52:48,566
Kathy!

371
00:52:49,527 --> 00:52:51,802
<i > Kathy!
Kathy!

372
00:53:43,578 --> 00:53:45,676
Why does he/she make us this mom?

373
00:53:51,691 --> 00:53:54,377
Mom doesn't know what happens, I am sure

374
00:53:55,763 --> 00:53:57,360
And why doesn't he/she never come?

375
00:53:59,194 --> 00:54:04,172
Kathy will already come..
soon, he/she will already come.

376
00:54:43,067 --> 00:54:46,372
Reason the grandmother not us
has he/she brought the food, today?

377
00:54:47,013 --> 00:54:48,655
Calm Cori will already come.

378
00:54:49,811 --> 00:54:53,512
Perhaps no longer there is but eaten.
Maybe you finishes.

379
00:54:55,024 --> 00:54:57,145
To my he/she gives me same because I am not hungry.

380
00:54:59,430 --> 00:55:00,567
They will already bring it

381
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:32,284
- Good night John
- Good night Mr.

382
00:55:40,489 --> 00:55:43,347
<i > they didn't give us solar light, neither eaten.

383
00:55:43,348 --> 00:55:47,242
<i > Our faces became but pale
and our bodies but thin.

384
00:55:48,094 --> 00:55:52,329
<i > When the grandmother stopped to feed
small Cori became very sick.

385
00:55:52,994 --> 00:55:56,466
<i > AND you every day he/she left
weakening but and but.

386
00:56:30,686 --> 00:56:31,939
Run him a little.

387
00:56:41,575 --> 00:56:42,864
That you will make?

388
00:56:46,548 --> 00:56:47,781
That you will make!

389
00:56:48,023 --> 00:56:51,855
- Lift him/her the head
- Reason?, that you will make him/her?

390
00:56:52,454 --> 00:56:53,398
There is what I tell you.

391
00:57:02,999 --> 00:57:06,608
I have thought of another form of escaping,
I will attempt it tonight.

392
00:57:09,527 --> 00:57:11,301
If you want to come with me, well.

393
00:57:13,294 --> 00:57:14,868
If I won't leave alone..

394
00:58:29,696 --> 00:58:31,187
See to see that door.

395
00:59:40,744 --> 00:59:41,967
Kathy

396
00:59:48,826 --> 00:59:49,969
It belongs to mom.

397
00:59:53,039 --> 00:59:54,458
It is their room.

398
01:00:10,627 --> 01:00:14,605
Vamonos cannot stay here,
all this will have an explanation.

399
01:00:15,425 --> 01:00:18,563
When we see mom we will ask it to him
and she won't count them

400
01:00:20,682 --> 01:00:22,568
We go, we cannot continue looking.

401
01:00:35,115 --> 01:00:38,288
We go over there.

402
01:01:44,774 --> 01:01:45,806
Is he?

403
01:01:47,009 --> 01:01:48,171
This dead one, Christopher!

404
01:01:49,686 --> 01:01:51,050
That it happens if you see us?

405
01:01:51,051 --> 01:01:52,642
He/she cannot see us
if this dead.

406
01:02:37,325 --> 01:02:39,322
You have always been my favorite Coríne.

407
01:02:58,980 --> 01:02:59,519
Somewhere around.

408
01:03:44,865 --> 01:03:48,234
- Do you continue him/her wanting I eat before?
- Not ask silly questions.

409
01:03:51,247 --> 01:03:53,883
Where he/she wants that this, will be
thinking of us.

410
01:03:55,474 --> 01:03:59,240
When he/she comes to look for us, him
we will understand and everything will make a sense.

411
01:03:59,580 --> 01:04:02,658
- The twins sick Christopher are.
- They will become well.

412
01:04:02,670 --> 01:04:05,531
- Chris...
- Not I don't want to speak but of it

413
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:12,173
That sick old lunatic won't live for
always Kathy. Pudistes to see that that night.

414
01:04:12,843 --> 01:04:19,726
Not he/she knows who were who were.
Not we can forget the reason for which we came.

415
01:04:20,342 --> 01:04:23,986
All the money of the world is not worth
the life that we are losing.

416
01:04:24,499 --> 01:04:28,376
Non voucher for tí, but mom
without that money he/she doesn't have anything.

417
01:04:28,839 --> 01:04:30,811
He/she has us, if he cared!

418
01:04:33,670 --> 01:04:36,908
We take the twins and ourselves
we go, Christopher!

419
01:04:37,891 --> 01:04:42,067
We have that buarcar an exit
before it is too much afternoon.

420
01:04:42,159 --> 01:04:46,825
And that we will make later that go to
to make to feed them at the four?

421
01:04:48,938 --> 01:04:53,517
Your you don't have any doubt, you don't realize
how much mom has it changed?

422
01:04:54,265 --> 01:04:57,488
Not you realize where she is
taking their ambition for the money?

423
01:05:00,532 --> 01:05:02,599
Non accent of thinking of their room...

424
01:05:04,978 --> 01:05:09,420
He/she is our mother Kathy..
That quires that he/she says?

425
01:05:13,247 --> 01:05:15,088
Alone the truth.

426
01:05:18,053 --> 01:05:18,964
Cori?

427
01:05:19,327 --> 01:05:22,056
I want to vomit Kathy.

428
01:06:42,245 --> 01:06:46,461
- Because these removing the flowers Carrie?
- Because it is already time.

429
01:06:47,263 --> 01:06:48,297
So that?

430
01:06:48,925 --> 01:06:50,159
For the winter.

431
01:06:51,437 --> 01:06:54,765
- Does it hurt your head cori?
- Today not, hurted me yesterday.

432
01:06:55,862 --> 01:06:57,978
- And to the throat?
- A little.

433
01:07:01,497 --> 01:07:03,664
Numbness in the fingers
of the hands and the feet?

434
01:07:03,752 --> 01:07:04,878
That it is numbness?

435
01:07:05,946 --> 01:07:08,812
It is when you don't feel the fingers and
we say that they have been slept.

436
01:07:08,827 --> 01:07:10,489
Sometimes.

437
01:07:14,367 --> 01:07:15,610
Become trained the hands.

438
01:07:17,930 --> 01:07:21,269
- That these making?
- I examine you.

439
01:07:23,103 --> 01:07:25,436
<i > Children, I am already here!

440
01:07:27,947 --> 01:07:30,408
Children, I am very happy...

441
01:07:31,745 --> 01:07:37,064
Kathy that you have made? Very well daughter
these very pretty one with the short hair.

442
01:07:44,230 --> 01:07:47,974
Are they angry with me?. Not they know
as I have missed them.

443
01:07:48,066 --> 01:07:52,408
Wait to see the gifts that he/she buys them.
He/she wanted to warn them when it was leaving, but...

444
01:07:53,088 --> 01:07:55,236
...but guess, guess the
that it has happened!

445
01:07:55,656 --> 01:07:57,964
- Has the grandfather died?
- No.

446
01:07:58,737 --> 01:08:00,407
Have they taken it to a hospital?

447
01:08:00,776 --> 01:08:04,516
Not I am happy because you this dying.
I am happy because the he/she loves me.

448
01:08:06,298 --> 01:08:07,733
Don't they understand it?

449
01:08:08,573 --> 01:08:13,805
I made what I promised them, he has liked I so much
that he/she will give a party for me tonight.

450
01:08:15,008 --> 01:08:18,786
A great party, to show up in society.

451
01:08:19,656 --> 01:08:24,298
And tomorrow he/she has an interview
with their lawyer Wislow, is very nice...

452
01:08:25,064 --> 01:08:26,970
...to include me in their Testament.

453
01:08:27,708 --> 01:08:31,671
He/she has said that he/she will leave everything.
Even this house.

454
01:08:31,996 --> 01:08:34,587
And that it passes with your children mom?
Does he/she know that they exist?

455
01:08:34,809 --> 01:08:37,166
We know perfectly as
he/she feels regarding that.

456
01:08:37,559 --> 01:08:42,766
And that it will belong to us mom?
As much as time will have to live in this prison?

457
01:08:43,944 --> 01:08:44,838
Prison?

458
01:08:45,407 --> 01:08:49,790
You have come with gifts for all us.
Do you believe that that compensates what we are suffering?

459
01:08:50,211 --> 01:08:53,526
Christopher... if you no longer love me...

460
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:58,098
Not I have stopped to love you mom,
I put under an obligation to love you every day...

461
01:08:58,669 --> 01:09:00,338
...in spite of that faces.

462
01:09:00,725 --> 01:09:02,052
Not say a word but.

463
01:09:02,424 --> 01:09:03,774
Look at us mom!

464
01:09:03,809 --> 01:09:06,871
That aspect has compared with their
blushed cheeks and brilliant eyes!

465
01:09:07,079 --> 01:09:10,981
You have seen as the twins are, to Cori him
the stomach almost hurts every day...

466
01:09:11,376 --> 01:09:13,778
And to Carrie they are leaving him/her stains in the skin.

467
01:09:14,261 --> 01:09:17,101
You have idea or at least you worry about the but
minimum that the grandmother accent of feeding...

468
01:09:17,158 --> 01:09:19,131
...does he/she make but of one week?
- Already coarse!

469
01:09:20,186 --> 01:09:22,128
Not you are entitled any of speaking to me in that way.

470
01:09:23,604 --> 01:09:27,047
You accuse me of being well
when my children were bad.

471
01:09:27,913 --> 01:09:34,374
You are unjust.
When they are able to be affectionate with me..

472
01:09:35,059 --> 01:09:36,195
...I will return.

473
01:10:14,941 --> 01:10:16,160
That these making?

474
01:10:16,548 --> 01:10:19,470
I will lower, I want to see like it is the party.

475
01:10:21,824 --> 01:10:22,994
Do you come with me?

476
01:12:06,148 --> 01:12:07,842
Because they are not orderly and dresses?

477
01:12:08,410 --> 01:12:11,525
They already know that during the day I don't like
that they are with the clothes of sleeping.

478
01:12:12,095 --> 01:12:13,392
Cori this sick person

479
01:12:14,064 --> 01:12:15,234
It is very bad

480
01:12:16,469 --> 01:12:17,594
A Doctor Needs.

481
01:12:57,673 --> 01:12:59,142
Because you stay there still?

482
01:12:59,462 --> 01:13:02,731
Cori needs to go to a Hospital.
Not there is another decision that to take.

483
01:13:04,718 --> 01:13:07,444
Can one know that devils spend, mother?
You stayed stop there...

484
01:13:07,521 --> 01:13:10,914
...thinking of tí and in your money,
is seeing as Cori dying?

485
01:13:11,808 --> 01:13:13,672
Is it that you don't care what happens him/her?

486
01:13:14,506 --> 01:13:16,476
Have you forgotten that you are their Mother?

487
01:13:17,199 --> 01:13:18,740
Always you...

488
01:13:20,943 --> 01:13:21,442
Kathy!

489
01:13:21,644 --> 01:13:25,279
That you rot in the hell but you take to the one
Hospital to Cori at this time.

490
01:13:25,767 --> 01:13:29,735
You believe that you will be able to continue making that that
do want with us without nobody finds out?

491
01:13:30,126 --> 01:13:32,617
If Cori dies Mother you will pay it very expensive.

492
01:13:33,522 --> 01:13:36,427
You will pay it in a way or another
I will make you to pay it.

493
01:13:37,362 --> 01:13:39,112
I promise you that you will pay it.

494
01:13:42,737 --> 01:13:44,160
He/she enters.

495
01:13:45,711 --> 01:13:50,440
It takes to the boy below and he/she brings the car to the door,
my daughter will take it to the hospital.

496
01:14:08,535 --> 01:14:10,350
Hello John.

497
01:14:33,594 --> 01:14:36,239
Don't worry Fred..
It will return

498
01:15:36,264 --> 01:15:38,226
Cori had pneumonia

499
01:15:38,687 --> 01:15:40,673
The doctors have made what you/they have been able to

500
01:15:40,827 --> 01:15:43,053
Not there will be funeral
We have already buried him.

501
01:15:43,815 --> 01:15:45,040
Nó!

502
01:16:23,757 --> 01:16:27,695
Not I know that it passes Fred, Christopher.
He/she has not wakened up.

503
01:17:41,224 --> 01:17:42,819
<i > Poisoning for arsenic.

504
01:17:43,716 --> 01:17:45,380
<i > In the sugar of the cookies.

505
01:17:46,810 --> 01:17:49,344
In small quantities he/she doesn't have flavor neither scent.

506
01:17:51,786 --> 01:17:53,569
It is very difficult of detecting.

507
01:17:54,469 --> 01:17:56,681
If they had made him/her the autopsy
has not discovered it.

508
01:17:56,924 --> 01:17:58,301
Unless has suspicions.

509
01:17:59,383 --> 01:18:00,350
That we will make?

510
01:18:02,498 --> 01:18:05,275
Tonight I will lower...

511
01:18:06,626 --> 01:18:07,770
...I will look for some money...

512
01:18:08,176 --> 01:18:10,500
...or a couple of rings of brilliant of
those that the grandmother takes.

513
01:18:11,534 --> 01:18:12,485
And later what?

514
01:18:13,588 --> 01:18:15,257
Then we will leave Kathy

515
01:18:16,610 --> 01:18:19,054
Not I know to where, but we will leave.

516
01:18:19,887 --> 01:18:23,654
What happens later...
... it will depend on us...

517
01:18:25,312 --> 01:18:26,488
...but in any event...

518
01:18:27,781 --> 01:18:28,982
...we will be free.

519
01:19:05,955 --> 01:19:08,249
- Is it really necessary to wait until tomorrow?
- Yes

520
01:19:09,915 --> 01:19:12,061
- Not I know if I will be able to.
- You should.

521
01:19:13,508 --> 01:19:15,089
Which the difference is in 12 hours?

522
01:19:16,197 --> 01:19:18,641
The difference between a ring and two.

523
01:19:23,284 --> 01:19:24,412
Damned you are!

524
01:19:26,442 --> 01:19:27,600
Damned you are!

525
01:19:28,752 --> 01:19:29,658
That it has happened?

526
01:19:29,681 --> 01:19:30,483
We will leave tomorrow.

527
01:19:30,642 --> 01:19:31,835
- Have you found an exit?
- If!

528
01:19:32,140 --> 01:19:34,890
- Where a window?
- Nó, a door. The main door.

529
01:19:35,266 --> 01:19:36,039
That!

530
01:19:36,351 --> 01:19:37,988
For tomorrow they are preparing another party.

531
01:19:38,420 --> 01:19:40,023
I have seen as they fixed one of the living rooms.

532
01:19:40,833 --> 01:19:42,243
They will probably have about 100 companies.

533
01:19:42,605 --> 01:19:43,379
He/she can that but.

534
01:19:43,802 --> 01:19:46,552
Not they will have to have the closed door
with that quantity of people entering.

535
01:19:49,056 --> 01:19:51,353
That it has passed Christopher below?
That but you have seen?

536
01:19:54,037 --> 01:19:57,007
Your you have told me that we are us
against them and that we are alone.

537
01:19:57,646 --> 01:19:59,195
Don't lie me Christopher.

538
01:20:02,022 --> 01:20:04,854
Not it is alone a party, Kathy.
It is a wedding.

539
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:07,048
Mom you vá to marry that man tomorrow.

540
01:21:11,189 --> 01:21:12,188
Nó Chris!

541
01:21:28,527 --> 01:21:30,164
I am afraid Christopher

542
01:21:30,549 --> 01:21:33,508
Not you have reason to have it
already nobody will be able to make us I damage.

543
01:21:36,667 --> 01:21:38,038
- Somewhere around
- Nó Chris

544
01:21:38,297 --> 01:21:41,935
Not we can allow that you goes out with his.
We have to count the truth to the grandfather.

545
01:21:42,123 --> 01:21:43,681
We can no longer care it. Vámonos

546
01:21:43,757 --> 01:21:46,781
Mom cannot keep the heréncia later
of what has made with us.

547
01:21:47,416 --> 01:21:48,270
We go, quick.

548
01:22:21,802 --> 01:22:22,962
Not it is

549
01:22:24,795 --> 01:22:25,933
Kathy has died.

550
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:30,818
That very now we can already be with Mom.

551
01:22:32,247 --> 01:22:33,118
Non Carrie

552
01:22:34,214 --> 01:22:35,634
Mom lied us

553
01:22:36,482 --> 01:22:38,932
He/she said that he/she would come to look for us when
dies the grandfather...

554
01:22:40,004 --> 01:22:41,214
...but it never returned.

555
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:46,167
Alone he/she worries about her, Carrie.

556
01:22:49,873 --> 01:22:51,735
It will ruin it everything.

557
01:22:52,579 --> 01:22:53,943
Not we can wait but.

558
01:22:54,245 --> 01:22:55,212
But he/she is their mother.

559
01:22:55,824 --> 01:22:56,984
And those they are their friends.

560
01:22:58,068 --> 01:22:59,350
And it is my wedding.

561
01:23:00,524 --> 01:23:02,146
We will begin the ceremony, now.

562
01:23:27,191 --> 01:23:28,561
Today is April 23.

563
01:23:35,362 --> 01:23:36,764
Christopher that that is?

564
01:23:37,922 --> 01:23:39,261
Grandfather's Testament

565
01:23:40,831 --> 01:23:41,841
For 2 months.

566
01:23:42,243 --> 01:23:43,964
He/she says that if it is demonstrated that mom had children...

567
01:23:44,004 --> 01:23:45,173
...of their previous marriage...

568
01:23:45,572 --> 01:23:46,855
...still after their death...

569
01:23:47,521 --> 01:23:48,787
...it will be disinherited.

570
01:23:50,412 --> 01:23:52,943
Mom agreed for
that they never found us.

571
01:23:54,409 --> 01:23:56,335
Not he/she planned to never take us out of the Loft.

572
01:24:26,558 --> 01:24:29,178
My very Dear Relatives and friends...

573
01:24:30,255 --> 01:24:33,350
...we are here gathered in this day
cheerful and jubilant...

574
01:24:34,001 --> 01:24:37,330
...to gather Corine and Val in Sacred Marriage.

575
01:24:38,316 --> 01:24:39,258
Let us pray...

576
01:24:42,882 --> 01:24:46,877
Celestial Father..
In him Genesis is spoken of the Creation

577
01:24:48,534 --> 01:24:51,089
Your dijistes that was not good that
the man is alone

578
01:24:51,838 --> 01:24:52,910
and for it creastes to the woman...

579
01:24:52,981 --> 01:24:56,191
...giving your blessing of the Sacred Marriage

580
01:24:57,444 --> 01:24:59,460
It Protects Mister to Val and Corine...

581
01:25:00,161 --> 01:25:01,804
...and grant them your grace.

582
01:25:03,016 --> 01:25:05,853
Grant him/her the force and the serenity
so that they honor the votes that end up...

583
01:25:05,925 --> 01:25:06,926
...of making before us.

584
01:25:07,728 --> 01:25:11,738
We request you that in your infinite kindness
bless their home...

585
01:25:11,872 --> 01:25:15,646
...fill them of healthy and happy children.

586
01:25:16,238 --> 01:25:17,526
For our Christ Mr....

587
01:25:17,875 --> 01:25:18,673
...Amen

588
01:25:22,036 --> 01:25:23,227
Mother!

589
01:25:28,133 --> 01:25:29,553
Do you like my dress?

590
01:25:30,327 --> 01:25:32,374
I found appropriate for this occasion.

591
01:25:33,314 --> 01:25:36,081
- Who you are?
- As they have entered?

592
01:25:36,861 --> 01:25:38,641
Have you maybe forgotten that we exist?

593
01:25:38,845 --> 01:25:39,900
Mom

594
01:25:41,547 --> 01:25:42,844
Who children are?

595
01:25:43,107 --> 01:25:44,793
We are the girlfriend's children.

596
01:25:46,033 --> 01:25:49,332
That foolishness, you know very well that
I don't have children.

597
01:25:49,873 --> 01:25:50,913
That they take them to him of here

598
01:25:51,355 --> 01:25:53,742
Not I will allow that some
evil and cruel children...

599
01:25:53,806 --> 01:25:55,023
...ruin my wedding.

600
01:25:55,084 --> 01:25:57,050
Your you are the evil and cruel, mother!

601
01:25:57,598 --> 01:25:59,467
Us tuvistes locked in the loft and dijistes

602
01:25:59,526 --> 01:26:01,804
that you would come to look for us
when your father died.

603
01:26:01,944 --> 01:26:03,080
But never vinistes.

604
01:26:03,786 --> 01:26:05,447
Not you could leave that nobody
he/she found us...

605
01:26:05,571 --> 01:26:07,264
...because but you would be disinherited.

606
01:26:08,197 --> 01:26:09,275
Not it is certain

607
01:26:10,704 --> 01:26:11,574
Nó

608
01:26:12,063 --> 01:26:13,408
Can you prove what you say?

609
01:26:14,486 --> 01:26:17,397
He/she died... eating the same cookies that Cori.

610
01:26:17,829 --> 01:26:18,721
Who Cori is?

611
01:26:18,756 --> 01:26:21,352
He/she was your son, our small brother
and the matastes.

612
01:26:21,492 --> 01:26:23,038
In the same way that intentastes
to kill us.

613
01:26:23,959 --> 01:26:25,095
You look at us Mother

614
01:26:26,057 --> 01:26:27,723
As you have been able to make us this?!

615
01:26:29,566 --> 01:26:32,201
