1
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:34,243
All prisoners,

2
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:38,848
all prisoners,
report to Level B... now.

3
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:36,474
The taking of a life...

4
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:40,645
...is no minor matter.

5
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,781
Nor do we do it lightly.

6
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:47,223
This man has killed.

7
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:48,851
And he will be killed.

8
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:53,461
He will be taken down,

9
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,194
his head will be shaved.

10
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:58,497
He will be given confession...

11
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,237
...if he wishes it.

12
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:04,777
And then,
we will test the apparatus.

13
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:07,175
The lights will dim.

14
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,408
Once... twice...

15
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:12,849
the third time, his soul

16
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:15,011
will be in that new place.

17
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,680
And I leave it to you

18
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:21,089
to conjecture where
that new place will be.

19
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,594
I have no doubt but that
your thoughts will be troubled.

20
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:24,560
Keep them to yourselves.

21
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:28,133
I want no demonstrations.

22
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,395
I want no comments.

23
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:34,705
Take him down.

24
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:36,206
Move!

25
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:46,014
So long, guys.

26
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:47,016
So long, Bobby.

27
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:48,245
No talking.

28
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:49,413
What are you gonna do to him,

29
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:50,786
take away his commissary,
you son of a bitch?

30
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:51,754
Jim, keep it down, Jim.

31
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:53,916
Son of a bitch.

32
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:57,785
I can't believe it.

33
00:04:57,864 --> 00:04:58,853
Can you believe it?

34
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:00,296
Can you believe it, Neddy?

35
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,027
I can believe most anything.

36
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:03,465
My problem is,
I just don't care.

37
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:05,128
Taking Bobby to the bakery.

38
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:06,535
Sometimes it works that way.

39
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:12,008
The guy's going to die
and that's it?

40
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,904
What's your question?

41
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:15,674
That that's the end of it?

42
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:16,873
That he goes in that room...

43
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:18,347
That he goes in that room,
and they light him up,

44
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:19,315
and that's the end of it.

45
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:20,544
There's no eternal life
for his soul,

46
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,484
and the cruelty of the world?

47
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:22,781
Is that the thing?

48
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:24,413
Is that your problem
this fine evening?

49
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:26,716
Yes.

50
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:29,125
Why don't you talk
to the chaplain?

51
00:05:29,228 --> 00:05:31,321
I'm talking to you.

52
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:32,295
I'm busy.

53
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:34,195
I've got my mind
on higher things.

54
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:42,807
I feel bad, Ned.

55
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:44,740
Well, do your own time.

56
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:46,435
You two,

57
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:48,013
put these on.

58
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,784
What is this?

59
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:55,785
Tell me what it is.

60
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:57,116
Shut up!

61
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,384
Keep walking!

62
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:28,948
Life's a hellhole, pally.

63
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:09,857
You two were talking, hmm?

64
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:17,229
Answer me.

65
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:22,270
You two were talking
during my speech.

66
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,570
Uh... I...

67
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:27,272
You swine.

68
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:32,175
You little swine.

69
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:33,684
Hold him down.

70
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,516
You want order?

71
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:42,819
I'll give you order.

72
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:44,021
I'll give you order.

73
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:45,529
You want a lesson?

74
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,121
Is that what you want?

75
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:48,598
Is that what you want?

76
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:50,498
You want... you want a lesson?

77
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:51,534
I'll give you a lesson.

78
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:52,501
I'll give you a lesson.

79
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,270
Is that what you want?

80
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:57,035
W-Warden?

81
00:07:57,176 --> 00:07:58,666
They're ready, sir.

82
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:02,270
Keep them here.

83
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:04,508
We'll beat the other one later.

84
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:05,812
Yes, sir.

85
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:11,446
It's all right.

86
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:12,751
It's all right, Jim.

87
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,622
I'm in bad shape, Ned.

88
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:32,742
"The Lord shall judge his people
and repent himself

89
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:35,473
"for his servants when he seeth
the power is gone.

90
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:37,207
"There is none shut off or left

91
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,443
"who shall say,
'Where are their gods?

92
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,817
"'Their rock in whom
they trusted. "'

93
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:46,549
Nobody move!

94
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:47,956
Get back.
Get down.

95
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:51,788
Don't do this, my son.

96
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:54,492
Open that door.

97
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:56,057
I'm going to count to three.

98
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:57,066
One...

99
00:08:58,437 --> 00:08:59,563
Go on, open it!

100
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:04,166
Get in there!

101
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:16,679
Here, put these on.

102
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:20,187
Come on!

103
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:28,630
What do we do now?

104
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:31,328
Tell them you have
a man for the morgue.

105
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:32,665
Man for the morgue!

106
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:33,602
Man for the morgue.

107
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:34,501
Where's your pass?

108
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:55,993
Come on!

109
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,824
I'm not sure this
is such a good idea.

110
00:09:57,964 --> 00:09:59,192
Nobody's asking you, Ned.

111
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,165
Bob, they catch us now,
they'll kill us.

112
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,063
Welcome aboard.

113
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:20,175
Come on!

114
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:23,314
Come on!

115
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:26,247
Are we going,
or are we dying?

116
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:51,410
Come on.

117
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,482
Go on!

118
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:10,732
All right, let's go.

119
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:16,166
Look, Bob...

120
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:17,231
What?

121
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:19,742
Get out!

122
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:26,443
Ever hear the phrase,
"nothing to lose"?

123
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,718
Get after them!

124
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:12,890
My God, you goddamn fools!

125
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:14,363
Go!

126
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:40,087
Wake up, Jimmy, wake up.

127
00:12:57,843 --> 00:12:59,834
Rip it off, rip the number off.

128
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:08,279
I'm cold.

129
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:11,448
Yeah, I'm cold, too.
Come on, walk it out.

130
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:13,958
I'm cold.
I'm cold.

131
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:23,560
What happened to Bobby?

132
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,661
You think... you think
they got him, Neddy?

133
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:29,874
Look at this.

134
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:42,443
"Do not neglect to show
hospitality to strangers,

135
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:47,891
"for thereby some have
entertained angels, unawares.

136
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:49,756
Hebrews 13:1."

137
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:51,624
Very touching.

138
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:52,662
Hebrews.

139
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,624
Wait a second.

140
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:42,139
Hello.

141
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,844
Who the hell are ya?

142
00:14:57,963 --> 00:15:02,263
Do not neglect to show
hospitality to strangers,

143
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:05,770
for thereby, some have
entertained angels, unawares.

144
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:10,732
Hebrews 13:1.

145
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:13,806
What are you? Priests?

146
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:18,772
Yeah. That's right,
we're priests.

147
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:25,614
You put her down,
I'll give you a ride.

148
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:46,874
Into the town, across the bridge
and we're free.

149
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,538
I'm sure
they're looking for you.

150
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:49,511
What?

151
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:51,138
I'm sure they're
looking for you.

152
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,148
Who's looking for us?

153
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,876
The monastery,
your fellow priests.

154
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:55,544
Yeah, sure they're
looking for us.

155
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:56,916
What are you,
missing morning prayers?

156
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:58,387
Yeah, we're missing
the whole program.

157
00:15:58,490 --> 00:15:59,354
What do you care?

158
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:00,355
I don't care a damn thing.

159
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:01,686
I told you,
it's all superstition

160
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,852
far as I'm concerned.

161
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,395
That's fine.
Now you just drop us off

162
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:05,758
at a town.

163
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:07,458
I'll tell you what else...
you get people worked up...

164
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:08,725
you get people worked up

165
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,530
over that shrine of yours,
that Weeping Virgin.

166
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:12,159
We'll get out here.

167
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:14,330
Won't be one more minute,
I'll have you down.

168
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:15,464
Oh, we'll get out here.

169
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:16,838
Well, I could use your help...

170
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:18,206
carry my deer to the butcher.

171
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:20,142
I'll tell you what,
you go down to the garage,

172
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,143
and we'll come down

173
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,440
and help you carry
your deer for you.

174
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:23,538
Why don't you
just come with me?

175
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:25,173
We need a moment
to compose our thoughts.

176
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:26,148
If it weren't for you,

177
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:27,547
I'd never have killed that deer.

178
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:30,949
Well, thank you
for your courtesy.

179
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,523
God Bless you and all that.

180
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:55,573
Okay, Mr. Johnson,
just move it over there.

181
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:10,993
Can you swim, Jimmy?

182
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:11,994
No.

183
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:14,156
Neither can I.

184
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:24,356
Think Bobby made it, Neddy?

185
00:17:24,391 --> 00:17:25,638
Not like this, he didn't.

186
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:27,434
We got to ditch these togs.

187
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:35,977
Come on.

188
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:24,952
What are you gonna do
on Free Street, Neddy?

189
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:28,965
I'm gonna do it all, pally,
and I'm gonna do it again,

190
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:30,659
and I'm gonna get
two of the best of everything,

191
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:33,602
and anybody muck with me,
they're goin' down!

192
00:19:35,607 --> 00:19:37,632
Come on.

193
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:40,970
Ready?

194
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:42,411
I wonder what happened to Bobby.

195
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,141
I wonder...
I wonder if he got across.

196
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:45,545
What happened,
happened, Jim.

197
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:46,709
Maybe they got him back.

198
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:47,877
I'm not going back there.

199
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:49,544
That's right,
we're not going back.

200
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:54,591
Hey. Hey.

201
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:57,493
We look... we look like
a couple of Hoosiers.

202
00:19:57,963 --> 00:19:59,726
That's right, let's go.

203
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,200
Okay, let's go.

204
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:24,879
Hey, coins in the pocket.

205
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:26,481
Coins in the pocket,
that's good luck.

206
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:27,889
That's good luck,
don't you think?

207
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,857
Uh-huh. Right.

208
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:32,553
Oh, God.
Oh, God.

209
00:20:32,664 --> 00:20:35,929
It's okay.
It's gonna be okay.

210
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:36,866
I can't go back there.

211
00:20:36,901 --> 00:20:37,698
Nobody is going back.

212
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,499
It's going to be just fine.

213
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:41,004
I got to get
some smokes, man,

214
00:20:41,106 --> 00:20:42,095
I'm telling you.

215
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:53,315
Okay.

216
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:56,319
Let's get your smokes,

217
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:57,752
and then we'll go across.

218
00:20:57,823 --> 00:20:59,882
You take care of me, Ned,
because I got to get across.

219
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:00,947
Keep walking.

220
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:02,220
Got to get across.

221
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:04,956
Just keep walking.

222
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,412
Right with you.

223
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:26,814
Just want a pack
of tailor-mades.

224
00:21:26,918 --> 00:21:28,180
Yeah, right with you.

225
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,845
Bunch of damn nonsense,

226
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:33,185
all them damn priests
in town at the shrine.

227
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,850
Don't buy a damn thing,

228
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:36,585
but they want something,
you'd better have it

229
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:39,357
on hand.

230
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:40,362
Thanks, Miss Harris.

231
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:42,057
Thank you.

232
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:43,600
Be with you gents
in a second.

233
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:45,363
Yeah, we just want a
pack of tailor-mades.

234
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:47,062
Momentos of the shrine,

235
00:21:47,172 --> 00:21:50,039
postcards, key chains
of the Weeping Virgin.

236
00:21:50,175 --> 00:21:52,541
Not a penny in it,
but they want it every year.

237
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:56,444
Priests and tourists,
put on that dumb show!

238
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:00,777
Two packages of oatmeal.

239
00:22:00,852 --> 00:22:02,342
Set 'em down, will ya?

240
00:22:02,454 --> 00:22:03,716
Account's getting
a bit long.

241
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:04,653
Well, I need it.
Set 'em down.

242
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:07,819
I got a hungry kid.

243
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:10,088
You'll catch me later.

244
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:24,604
What are you looking at?!

245
00:22:26,144 --> 00:22:28,510
Yeah. That's right.

246
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:35,080
Special kind of smokes?

247
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,381
Luckys'll do.

248
00:22:37,456 --> 00:22:39,890
That Shrine, talking about it,

249
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:42,016
didn't mean to offend you.

250
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:43,083
I probably put my foot in it,

251
00:22:43,161 --> 00:22:44,719
and you're tourists,
come to see the shrine.

252
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:47,697
Where are you folks from?

253
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:49,061
Oh, here and there.

254
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:51,568
Something I can interest you
in that case?

255
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,228
We ought to be about going now.

256
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:56,034
We ought to be about going now!

257
00:22:56,174 --> 00:22:57,232
You forgot your change.

258
00:22:57,309 --> 00:22:58,799
That's okay.

259
00:23:01,913 --> 00:23:05,280
Sir, change. Let's see if we
can't spend it in your store.

260
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:07,147
Did you folks hear
about the jailbreak?

261
00:23:08,286 --> 00:23:10,754
No. I can't say that we have.

262
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:12,721
Where did you say
you were from?

263
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:21,631
Yes, sir, it, uh, seems
there were these three convicts

264
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,496
shot their way out.

265
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:27,669
There you are.

266
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:29,103
I told ya
I needed your help.

267
00:23:29,207 --> 00:23:31,937
Are these friends
of yours, Carolyn?

268
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,169
My help?

269
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:34,303
My car is stalled down
at the garage.

270
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:35,846
I need you to haul that deer
down to the butchers.

271
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:37,039
You know these folks?

272
00:23:37,115 --> 00:23:38,241
Know them, yeah,

273
00:23:38,316 --> 00:23:39,010
they're priests...

274
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:40,015
this is Father...

275
00:23:40,152 --> 00:23:41,380
I didn't catch your name.

276
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:44,688
Priests?!

277
00:23:44,823 --> 00:23:47,223
Oh, God.

278
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:48,724
Oh, God, I-I'm sorry.

279
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:51,295
Gentlemen... uh, Father...

280
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:54,866
What I'm saying, rambling on,
if I offended you...

281
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:57,264
no-no hard feelings?

282
00:23:57,369 --> 00:23:58,233
That's fine.

283
00:23:58,370 --> 00:23:59,894
You gonna help me
with that deer?

284
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:00,869
I mean, I'd die

285
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:02,030
if I thought
I'd offended you.

286
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:03,199
Hey, no big deal.

287
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,106
Or anybody associated
with the shrine.

288
00:24:05,243 --> 00:24:07,370
Here, a little-little token.

289
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:08,674
Take them, please.

290
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:10,840
Take some back
to your friends.

291
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:13,544
It's got the Weeping
Virgin on one side,

292
00:24:13,685 --> 00:24:15,482
a thermometer on the other.

293
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,019
Awful handy, really.

294
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,646
Well, it's a cool day out.

295
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:20,655
Button up.

296
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,555
No hard feelings, Father?

297
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:29,161
Go with God.

298
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,861
Hey, I have that same coat.

299
00:24:32,003 --> 00:24:33,300
Harry, here's a list.

300
00:24:33,371 --> 00:24:36,169
I also need a few shells
for the old 12-gauge.

301
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:38,105
The damn car is all stoved in,

302
00:24:38,243 --> 00:24:40,404
fender busted,
need a new radiator.

303
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:41,844
How am I gonna afford that?

304
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:47,780
I'll end up going to your
church, I swear to God.

305
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,045
Why don't you?

306
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,849
Everything's so expensive.

307
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:52,115
Canned goods.

308
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,555
Cheaper to shop in Canada.

309
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:54,784
So why don't you?

310
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,054
Because my car's wrecked.

311
00:24:56,127 --> 00:24:58,857
If I walk over, how am I going
to get my groceries back?

312
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:00,555
After what you've done for us,

313
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:03,190
we'll go with you
and fetch your things back.

314
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,828
That's very Christian of you.

315
00:25:07,205 --> 00:25:08,797
You know what the Bible says.

316
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:12,068
What? What's that?

317
00:25:12,143 --> 00:25:13,405
You know.

318
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:16,140
Matter of fact, I usually
do my shopping over there.

319
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:17,839
I wouldn't let on to Harry.

320
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:21,543
You think that's dishonesty,
you just go on and think it.

321
00:25:25,957 --> 00:25:27,049
I can't do it.

322
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:30,356
You can, Jim,
it's a piece of cake.

323
00:25:30,428 --> 00:25:32,862
I can't do it.

324
00:25:32,964 --> 00:25:34,625
Now, you want to kill
yourself, that's fine,

325
00:25:34,766 --> 00:25:36,893
but there's two of us here,
and I'm counting on you.

326
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:39,869
So you buck up, Jimmy,
and you act like a priest!

327
00:25:48,313 --> 00:25:50,372
Hail Mary, full of grace...

328
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:54,814
Morning, Mrs. Blair.

329
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,046
How are you today?

330
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:57,179
Are you working hard?

331
00:25:57,255 --> 00:25:58,552
Well, we're looking

332
00:25:58,657 --> 00:26:00,921
for those convicts that escaped.

333
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:02,084
Convicts, convic...

334
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,650
Hey, I found 'em for you!

335
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,028
I found your two lost priests.

336
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:14,662
Where have you been?

337
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:18,539
Uh... well... you know.

338
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:20,008
Sheriff, you know who these are?

339
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:21,203
No.

340
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,008
Caroline has found
our lost priests.

341
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:25,275
This is Father Brown
and Father Riley.

342
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:26,408
Thank the Lord.

343
00:26:26,484 --> 00:26:28,475
We thought maybe
the convicts got you.

344
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:29,713
Yeah, convicts.

345
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:30,652
Had a jailbreak.

346
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:32,086
Got me some killers
on the loose.

347
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:33,350
That's all right, boys.

348
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:34,858
But where have you been?

349
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:36,688
And where are your clothes?

350
00:26:36,828 --> 00:26:39,379
Uh... they got lost
when, uh... you know.

351
00:26:39,414 --> 00:26:41,930
I found them coming
through the woods.

352
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:44,533
Looked like a couple
of raggle-taggle gypsies.

353
00:26:44,636 --> 00:26:46,797
Gypsies?
Do you know who these are?

354
00:26:46,871 --> 00:26:48,668
This is Fathers Brown and Riley.

355
00:26:48,807 --> 00:26:51,367
Brown and Riley...
A New Look at Revelations?

356
00:26:52,811 --> 00:26:55,541
These are two of the finest
thinkers in the church today.

357
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,272
You're lucky you say you
were lost in the woods.

358
00:26:57,382 --> 00:26:58,747
You're lucky one
of my boys didn't

359
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:00,511
get on you, take you
for the convicts.

360
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:01,846
Oh, what would they have done?

361
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,547
Done, well,
he would have shot you.

362
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,322
We've been meeting
every bus for two days.

363
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,726
That's all right boys,
you let 'em through.

364
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:16,096
Now, you have a good day,
now, Mrs. Blair.

365
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:17,794
We best be getting back now.

366
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:20,996
We're going to help Mrs. Blair
with the groceries.

367
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,132
George, George!

368
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:25,039
Run along over with Mrs. Blair

369
00:27:25,176 --> 00:27:27,235
and help her with her shopping!

370
00:27:35,353 --> 00:27:37,685
We wired Arizona when
you didn't arrive on time,

371
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:39,256
but they said they had no clue.

372
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:42,190
Your monsignor is quite worried.

373
00:27:43,962 --> 00:27:46,829
Then the storm
and these prisoners...

374
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:48,091
I don't know.

375
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,258
I tell you something.

376
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:50,995
Nothing was going to
keep us from coming here.

377
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:52,000
Shall we go in?

378
00:27:52,137 --> 00:27:53,399
Get these chains

379
00:27:53,471 --> 00:27:55,564
knocked off at the blacksmith's,
then get into these priest duds

380
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:56,504
and then back over the border.

381
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:57,505
You call it, Neddy.

382
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:58,802
-Coming?
-Yeah.

383
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:36,110
I know
this must be

384
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:38,542
quite a moment for you,

385
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:41,050
having written so much
about the shrine,

386
00:28:41,152 --> 00:28:43,643
having never seen it.

387
00:28:43,755 --> 00:28:46,223
That's why I took you
back from the border.

388
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:57,828
I knew how much you
wanted to be here.

389
00:28:57,969 --> 00:28:59,095
Thank you.

390
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:02,264
The Weeping Madonna.

391
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:30,734
I'm sure you'll find
something here that'll fit.

392
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:33,062
God bless you both.

393
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:34,435
God bless you, Father.

394
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:37,172
God bless you.

395
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:47,381
Father, Father, we-we've been

396
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:49,282
waiting for you eagerly.

397
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,717
We-we prayed for you.

398
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,620
Yeah, uh, well, th...
we got delayed.

399
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:54,258
I-I've read all your books.

400
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:55,849
Thanks.

401
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,554
You know, you don't look
a thing like your pictures.

402
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:01,595
Fasting and prayer.

403
00:30:01,699 --> 00:30:04,497
Yeah, well, it's such an honor
to have men of your learning

404
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,001
and of your reputation here.

405
00:30:06,104 --> 00:30:07,662
We-we were so
worried about you.

406
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:08,898
Yeah, yeah.

407
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:10,235
We wired the
diocese in Arizona.

408
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:11,172
Yeah, he told us, he told.

409
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:12,173
We appreciate it.

410
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,299
Well...

411
00:30:13,378 --> 00:30:15,107
well, thank the Lord
you've-you've come.

412
00:30:15,246 --> 00:30:16,577
What... what's this?

413
00:30:22,854 --> 00:30:24,151
You don't know what that is?

414
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:28,151
No.

415
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:33,520
It's a clothespin.

416
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,632
But, Father, why... why were you

417
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:40,260
wearing it in your collar?

418
00:30:49,414 --> 00:30:50,938
The thing of it is, is...

419
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:56,612
You know what it is?

420
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:57,985
No.

421
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:04,419
It's a... reminder.

422
00:31:04,495 --> 00:31:07,396
Any of us could be
snatched at any moment.

423
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:10,992
Of course!

424
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:16,230
When Thou givest them
their bread in due season

425
00:31:16,307 --> 00:31:20,038
Thy openest Thine hand...

426
00:31:20,178 --> 00:31:25,844
And filleth all things living
with thy blessing

427
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:33,550
Gloria patri et filio
et spiritui sancto

428
00:31:33,658 --> 00:31:40,325
Sicut erat in principio,
et nunc, et semper

429
00:31:40,465 --> 00:31:44,060
Et in saecula saeculorum.

430
00:31:44,168 --> 00:31:47,262
Amen.

431
00:31:47,338 --> 00:31:51,707
Kyrie eleison

432
00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:56,405
Christe eleison

433
00:31:56,514 --> 00:32:00,974
Kyrie eleison

434
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:05,215
Christe eleison

435
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:09,124
Kyrie eleison

436
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:14,027
Christe eleison

437
00:32:14,165 --> 00:32:17,999
Kyrie eleison.

438
00:32:34,652 --> 00:32:35,778
I'd like to add

439
00:32:35,853 --> 00:32:37,582
one special prayer
of thanksgiving.

440
00:32:37,722 --> 00:32:39,849
My brothers and guests
here today,

441
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,949
a special prayer
of thanksgiving,

442
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,322
for the safe arrival

443
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:45,453
of Father Riley
and Father Brown.

444
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:47,862
Many of us are acquainted
with their work,

445
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:49,160
and we are all, I'm sure,

446
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:51,599
glad of the opportunity
to meet them in person.

447
00:32:55,673 --> 00:32:57,698
We're thankful
for their presence,

448
00:32:57,775 --> 00:33:00,243
their scholarship
and their participation

449
00:33:00,345 --> 00:33:03,143
in the Procession of the Shrine.

450
00:33:03,281 --> 00:33:05,613
Today, a special blessing.

451
00:33:05,717 --> 00:33:07,776
Father Brown,
would you render it for us?

452
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:12,513
I think you're Brown.

453
00:33:12,623 --> 00:33:13,885
I think you're Brown.

454
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,823
You're Brown.

455
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,052
Father Brown.

456
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,367
Bishop Nogalitch points out
it's his turn to say the grace.

457
00:33:27,305 --> 00:33:28,670
Please tell the bishop

458
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:31,173
we appreciate
his courtesy in ceding

459
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:34,574
his position
to our new arrivals.

460
00:33:38,249 --> 00:33:39,978
Oh, let, let him
read. It's his turn.

461
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:42,279
I don't want to get
in anybody's face here.

462
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:43,342
No, no, Father Brown.

463
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:44,718
Please. Honor us.

464
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:50,920
Father?

465
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,759
If you could follow me
to the lectern?

466
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:55,956
You know what?

467
00:34:58,529 --> 00:35:01,191
Let's just say
s-something appropriate.

468
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:08,196
Here's a good grace.

469
00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:13,034
Be nice to strangers,

470
00:35:13,144 --> 00:35:15,840
'cause sometimes
you're a stranger, too.

471
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:35,121
This is not a fitting grace.

472
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:36,690
What's wrong with it?

473
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:39,369
It's a bit unusual, but
quite to the point, I thought.

474
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:43,531
What are we, Protestants?

475
00:35:54,185 --> 00:35:56,847
Deo gratia...

476
00:36:22,713 --> 00:36:24,578
As soon as we pop
off the leg irons...

477
00:36:24,715 --> 00:36:25,841
Are you listening?

478
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:27,043
You listening?

479
00:36:27,118 --> 00:36:28,779
Jimmy, get out
of it, will ya?

480
00:36:32,924 --> 00:36:34,289
Lay low here for a while.

481
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:35,489
I'm gonna find some way

482
00:36:35,626 --> 00:36:36,524
to pop us out of these chains,

483
00:36:36,661 --> 00:36:38,128
and then we head
across the river.

484
00:36:40,932 --> 00:36:42,490
We're safe staying right here,
Ned.

485
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,464
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

486
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:45,000
Until the real priests
show up, we're safe.

487
00:36:52,944 --> 00:36:54,002
I hope you'll participate

488
00:36:54,078 --> 00:36:55,807
in our lectures
later on in the Shrine.

489
00:36:55,947 --> 00:36:57,539
Oh, I'd like nothing better.

490
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:06,848
Get these leg chains off,

491
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:08,322
then it's straight
across the river.

492
00:37:08,426 --> 00:37:09,290
You lay low around here.

493
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:10,826
Half an hour, meet you
right back here.

494
00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:12,327
Father Brown.

495
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:13,692
Who's Brown?

496
00:37:13,764 --> 00:37:14,753
You are.

497
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,165
Shall I enter your name
in the lottery?

498
00:37:18,302 --> 00:37:20,099
What's the prize?

499
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:23,230
Oh, hey, don't bother.

500
00:37:23,307 --> 00:37:25,138
Well...

501
00:37:25,276 --> 00:37:28,006
No, I never won anything.

502
00:37:28,145 --> 00:37:29,476
Oh, you can never tell.

503
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,877
I-I'll put you down.

504
00:38:38,549 --> 00:38:40,380
Afternoon, Bill.

505
00:38:40,518 --> 00:38:41,849
Sheriff.

506
00:38:44,422 --> 00:38:46,617
Going to need them horses
back this afternoon.

507
00:38:46,691 --> 00:38:49,290
Going back up
in the hills again?

508
00:38:49,325 --> 00:38:51,890
Well... they got
to be somewhere.

509
00:38:52,229 --> 00:38:54,254
They got no food,
prison clothes.

510
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:55,560
Either they're
up there in the woods,

511
00:38:55,633 --> 00:38:57,066
or they're going
to cross down over here.

512
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:59,159
You got the bridge staked out
pretty good, do you?

513
00:38:59,236 --> 00:39:01,261
Well, you best believe we do.

514
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:03,239
We're bringing out the dogs.

515
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:05,774
The dogs will be here
any minute.

516
00:39:05,876 --> 00:39:08,071
We've got the prison staff,
come down,

517
00:39:08,145 --> 00:39:10,136
stand guard on the bridge
with us.

518
00:39:10,214 --> 00:39:12,774
We'll catch them.
Don't you worry.

519
00:39:12,883 --> 00:39:14,544
Bring them back
whichever way they want.

520
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:16,419
You ask me though,

521
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:20,584
I think it'd be a lot less
problem, shoot to kill.

522
00:39:20,825 --> 00:39:22,850
That's what the Bible says,
isn't it?

523
00:39:22,927 --> 00:39:25,054
"They killed
and they shall be killed. "

524
00:39:33,504 --> 00:39:35,062
What was that?

525
00:39:35,172 --> 00:39:36,867
Well, I don't know.

526
00:39:47,184 --> 00:39:48,481
There she goes.

527
00:40:48,345 --> 00:40:50,643
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

528
00:40:50,748 --> 00:40:52,943
It's been three weeks
since my last confession.

529
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,587
I can't help myself.

530
00:40:57,688 --> 00:40:59,747
Yeah, uh-huh.

531
00:40:59,824 --> 00:41:01,416
Please, Father.

532
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:03,322
What?

533
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:05,190
Help me.

534
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:06,455
Okay, what, what, what is it?

535
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:07,763
I can't help you
if you don't tell me.

536
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:08,996
I've been sleeping
with this woman.

537
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,559
Huh? All right, and what,
you're not married to her?

538
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:12,897
No.

539
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,494
-You're married to someone else?
-My wife.

540
00:41:14,605 --> 00:41:15,799
-Does your wife know about this?
-No.

541
00:41:15,873 --> 00:41:17,864
Then what are you
worried about then?

542
00:41:17,942 --> 00:41:19,534
Forget about it, stop whining.

543
00:41:19,677 --> 00:41:21,010
But I broke my vow.

544
00:41:21,045 --> 00:41:23,707
I'm such a sinner.
Help me.

545
00:41:24,014 --> 00:41:25,345
Okay, okay, look.

546
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:26,882
Try to break off
seeing this broad.

547
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:28,781
Say ten Hail Mary's,
make a good Act of Contrition,

548
00:41:28,919 --> 00:41:31,717
if you see the girl again,
pop back in, no big deal.

549
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:34,385
God bless you.

550
00:41:41,732 --> 00:41:43,529
I can't, Father,
I can't help myself.

551
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:44,759
You have to help me.

552
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:46,097
Now, look,
I did what I could.

553
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,262
You know, there's a time

554
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:48,999
when a man's got to stand up,
take a stand.

555
00:41:49,139 --> 00:41:50,538
Why don't you take
a few days off,

556
00:41:50,641 --> 00:41:53,166
go in the woods, something,
make your peace with God.

557
00:41:53,277 --> 00:41:54,835
No, no, I can't leave town
until we catch those convicts.

558
00:41:54,945 --> 00:41:56,242
I'm stuck here in town.

559
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:57,644
I'm in a state
of constant temptation.

560
00:41:57,715 --> 00:41:59,114
Please, I can't control myself.

561
00:41:59,216 --> 00:42:00,683
I need your help,
Father.

562
00:42:00,784 --> 00:42:01,648
You're a good man.

563
00:42:01,785 --> 00:42:03,275
You're a pious man.
Help me.

564
00:42:03,387 --> 00:42:04,251
How can I help you?

565
00:42:04,388 --> 00:42:05,354
Come with me.
Come with me.

566
00:42:05,389 --> 00:42:06,447
Talk to her,
talk to us together.

567
00:42:06,624 --> 00:42:07,488
Now, look, look, buddy...

568
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:08,717
I've dragged her in sin, Father.

569
00:42:08,792 --> 00:42:09,656
Well, I'm sure...

570
00:42:09,793 --> 00:42:11,055
Father, please,
I'm begging you!

571
00:42:11,128 --> 00:42:12,459
-Please, help me!
-Get up, get up.

572
00:42:12,563 --> 00:42:15,157
Please, Father, please.
I need your help.

573
00:42:15,299 --> 00:42:18,393
All right, all right, all right,
all right, okay, okay.

574
00:42:18,469 --> 00:42:19,333
Okay.

575
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:20,528
Okay.

576
00:42:20,604 --> 00:42:22,697
Thank you, Father.

577
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:31,306
Get in there.

578
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:32,508
Back, come on.

579
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:33,982
Come on, come on.

580
00:42:34,084 --> 00:42:35,745
Take it out.

581
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:38,616
Take it out.

582
00:42:42,626 --> 00:42:43,820
And I prayed.

583
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:45,486
I prayed to the Blessed Virgin,

584
00:42:45,596 --> 00:42:47,587
and I prayed to Saint Anne,
and I asked,

585
00:42:47,665 --> 00:42:50,190
I asked myself, "Why,
why am I so weak?

586
00:42:50,301 --> 00:42:51,967
Why am I branded?"

587
00:42:52,002 --> 00:42:56,632
And I said, "Lord, Lord,
I am a fornicator.

588
00:42:56,941 --> 00:42:59,432
"What am I doing to myself
and to my wife?

589
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:02,603
I am a fornicator. "

590
00:43:06,784 --> 00:43:08,945
She can't hear... the poor
child's deaf and dumb.

591
00:43:10,688 --> 00:43:12,178
Up here, Father.

592
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:27,832
I brought this priest here
to avow our sins.

593
00:43:27,972 --> 00:43:29,132
I don't care.

594
00:43:29,206 --> 00:43:30,969
Whore, we have sinned.

595
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:32,370
Hey, I don't care.

596
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:34,104
And I told you I don't care.

597
00:43:34,244 --> 00:43:35,336
You did what you did.

598
00:43:35,412 --> 00:43:37,004
If you think it's a sin,
you live with it.

599
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:38,113
Now, I'm busy now.

600
00:43:38,148 --> 00:43:40,548
Please, help me.
Please, help me.

601
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:42,308
You got a problem?

602
00:43:42,419 --> 00:43:44,011
Stop coming here.

603
00:43:44,154 --> 00:43:45,485
You think you're filthy?

604
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:46,817
You think you're a swine?

605
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:48,482
All those names you say
while we're doing it?

606
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:49,490
I'm going to be sick.

607
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:51,652
You be sick...

608
00:43:51,729 --> 00:43:54,254
you be sick somewhere else.

609
00:44:00,037 --> 00:44:01,197
Well...

610
00:44:01,271 --> 00:44:03,967
He's got no cause to be
coming here like that.

611
00:44:04,108 --> 00:44:05,473
Yeah, well,
you don't like the guy,

612
00:44:05,576 --> 00:44:06,873
why'd you go to bed
with him for?

613
00:44:07,011 --> 00:44:08,342
For five dollars.

614
00:44:08,445 --> 00:44:09,776
What, do you have five dollars?

615
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,177
I'll go to bed with you, too.

616
00:44:11,281 --> 00:44:12,373
What, you think that's a sin?

617
00:44:12,449 --> 00:44:13,313
You think I care?

618
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:14,849
Your mumbo jumbo.
You think I...

619
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:16,179
I slept with him, yeah,
and I'll sleep

620
00:44:16,253 --> 00:44:17,481
with anybody
comes up with five bucks.

621
00:44:17,554 --> 00:44:18,851
That thievery?
Yeah, throw me out.

622
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:21,150
What you priests
pay me to work here,

623
00:44:21,225 --> 00:44:22,124
do your own goddamn washing.

624
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:23,786
And don't you
talk to me about God.

625
00:44:24,194 --> 00:44:25,525
Don't you tell me about sin.

626
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:27,187
Your religion's so good,
your God,

627
00:44:27,297 --> 00:44:28,787
get him to cure my little girl.

628
00:44:28,899 --> 00:44:31,163
Hey, cure that girl out
there, your Blessed Shrine.

629
00:44:31,235 --> 00:44:32,259
Your Saint Annie,

630
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:35,328
your Weeping Virgin, yeah,
cure my little girl.

631
00:44:35,406 --> 00:44:36,873
Get out of here.

632
00:44:36,974 --> 00:44:40,705
You've got your nerve.

633
00:44:57,795 --> 00:45:01,026
I need a man.

634
00:45:01,098 --> 00:45:03,965
I need a husband.

635
00:45:04,101 --> 00:45:06,695
My little girl needs help.

636
00:45:09,273 --> 00:45:11,400
I got nothing.

637
00:45:13,277 --> 00:45:15,177
Are you gonna give me
those things?

638
00:45:17,281 --> 00:45:18,873
Are you gonna
give me those things?

639
00:45:22,086 --> 00:45:24,145
I wish I could.

640
00:45:27,357 --> 00:45:30,224
I wish you could, too.

641
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:31,622
But you can't,

642
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:35,290
so why don't you just get
the hell out of my life!

643
00:45:54,351 --> 00:45:56,478
Father, here.

644
00:45:56,553 --> 00:45:58,145
What's this for?

645
00:45:58,255 --> 00:45:59,745
It's for your
beautiful project.

646
00:45:59,857 --> 00:46:01,757
It's for the restoration
of the Shrine.

647
00:46:01,892 --> 00:46:04,224
Oh. I can't thank you enough.

648
00:46:04,328 --> 00:46:05,226
God bless you.

649
00:46:05,362 --> 00:46:06,659
It's for a good cause.

650
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:07,992
You don't know the half of it.

651
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:10,964
Here.

652
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:12,363
Have a key chain.

653
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:13,494
Thank you.

654
00:46:21,512 --> 00:46:22,945
Uh, actually,
I got five dollars.

655
00:46:23,046 --> 00:46:23,944
Get out of here!

656
00:46:24,081 --> 00:46:26,379
I had enough of your bullshit
for one day.

657
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,860
Come on.

658
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:48,536
Son of a bitch.

659
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:50,334
I knew it,
those convicts are here.

660
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:53,739
Here, get the scent,
quick, come on, come on.

661
00:47:00,951 --> 00:47:04,409
Yeah, who is it?

662
00:47:04,521 --> 00:47:05,419
Father?

663
00:47:05,556 --> 00:47:06,750
Yeah, what is it?

664
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:11,756
Uh, I wanted to ask you...

665
00:47:11,895 --> 00:47:16,127
A New Look at Revelations,
you-you approached 10:19,

666
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,929
"Love the Stranger,
for you yourselves

667
00:47:18,068 --> 00:47:20,685
were strangers once
in the land of Egypt. "

668
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:23,302
And-and you used the word,
a "sacrament. "

669
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:25,735
You liked that, huh?

670
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:27,037
Well, yes, yes.

671
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:28,600
I appreciated it.

672
00:47:30,914 --> 00:47:34,213
And-and what I believed was
an echo of the Gnostic.

673
00:47:34,284 --> 00:47:36,149
The-the ecstatic mold.

674
00:47:36,286 --> 00:47:39,687
Well, that is
to say a true...

675
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:41,223
Well, that is to say, uh,

676
00:47:41,325 --> 00:47:45,557
a noninterpretive
understanding of the text.

677
00:47:45,629 --> 00:47:46,857
You got it.

678
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:49,091
I did?

679
00:47:51,101 --> 00:47:54,195
I thought... I mean, I thought
that I did. I just...

680
00:47:54,271 --> 00:47:56,038
Forgive me if I'm running on.

681
00:47:56,073 --> 00:47:57,904
You know, here at the
monastery, we're-we're

682
00:47:58,242 --> 00:48:00,142
enjoined to silence
for most of the year.

683
00:48:01,278 --> 00:48:02,370
And, you know,

684
00:48:02,446 --> 00:48:04,038
it's such a pleasure
when the bonds are lifted

685
00:48:04,181 --> 00:48:05,307
for the Feast of the Shrine.

686
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:06,974
And then, this week,
to have all this company...

687
00:48:07,084 --> 00:48:09,211
It's a heady thing.

688
00:48:11,255 --> 00:48:15,954
Well, and then we-we heard
your bags were stolen and, uh,

689
00:48:16,093 --> 00:48:18,186
well, in-in line
with that verse,

690
00:48:18,262 --> 00:48:20,462
"kindness to the stranger,"

691
00:48:20,497 --> 00:48:24,126
uh, I wan...
I wanted you to have these.

692
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:26,801
Get out of here.

693
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:29,566
No.

694
00:48:29,706 --> 00:48:31,333
It's an honor.

695
00:48:31,475 --> 00:48:33,841
It's... it's an honor
meeting you.

696
00:48:35,178 --> 00:48:36,611
Back at ya.

697
00:48:36,713 --> 00:48:38,408
Hey, thanks.

698
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:47,283
Well...

699
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:53,123
Oh, God.
Oh, God.

700
00:48:55,499 --> 00:48:56,363
Here.

701
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:57,592
We got to get out of here.

702
00:48:57,668 --> 00:48:59,533
Sheriffs all over the place.

703
00:49:04,708 --> 00:49:09,202
I-I really wanted to ask you,
will you sign my book?

704
00:49:10,881 --> 00:49:12,280
Sure, give it to me.

705
00:49:16,086 --> 00:49:18,646
We all, especially, enjoyed
your section about the Shrine.

706
00:49:18,755 --> 00:49:20,052
You liked that, huh?

707
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:22,717
Oh, yes, very much.

708
00:49:22,859 --> 00:49:25,157
Which one am I?

709
00:49:25,262 --> 00:49:28,254
I think Father Brown and I,
we have to talk.

710
00:49:31,335 --> 00:49:33,997
Father? Fathers?

711
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:36,435
Will you be coming
in the Procession tomorrow?

712
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:37,632
Depends on
how things falls out.

713
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:39,005
I can't give you
a definite yes or no.

714
00:49:39,109 --> 00:49:40,201
If you'll excuse us...

715
00:49:40,277 --> 00:49:41,676
we have to talk about
writing things.

716
00:49:41,778 --> 00:49:43,507
Oh, of course.

717
00:49:58,795 --> 00:50:00,228
What took you so long?

718
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:01,319
I got lost.

719
00:50:01,398 --> 00:50:03,662
Look, that kid gave me
his beads.

720
00:50:03,734 --> 00:50:05,793
Yeah, I'm very happy for you.

721
00:50:11,041 --> 00:50:12,941
Hold still.

722
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:17,646
Ah, thank you.

723
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:19,478
Now, a dash across the river,

724
00:50:19,816 --> 00:50:21,078
and it's Free Street, baby.

725
00:50:21,151 --> 00:50:22,243
I'm with you, Neddy.

726
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:23,411
Some booze and some broads,

727
00:50:23,487 --> 00:50:27,082
and this country
can kiss my ass!

728
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:34,421
We hit the border, you make the
sign of the cross over the guy.

729
00:50:34,498 --> 00:50:35,897
I make the sign of the cross
over the guy.

730
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:38,024
-Afternoon, Father.
-Afternoon, Afternoon.

731
00:50:38,101 --> 00:50:39,466
Open your book.
Look in your book.

732
00:50:39,569 --> 00:50:40,763
Mumble something.
Here we go.

733
00:50:40,837 --> 00:50:43,237
Down in your book.

734
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:44,898
What do you think happened
to Bobby?

735
00:50:45,075 --> 00:50:46,940
I don't know.
We'll talk about it later.

736
00:50:49,946 --> 00:50:51,436
What's the first thing
you're gonna do

737
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:53,641
-when you get free, Ned?
-Keep your mouth open, Jim,

738
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:55,548
and we'll talk about it
on the northern side.

739
00:50:55,685 --> 00:50:57,949
I'm gonna do... I'm gonna do
something important.

740
00:50:58,055 --> 00:50:59,682
Yeah, that's fine.

741
00:50:59,823 --> 00:51:01,450
Figure you're only alive
so long,

742
00:51:01,591 --> 00:51:03,957
you might as well do
something with yourself.

743
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:05,255
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

744
00:51:05,328 --> 00:51:06,920
Piece of cake.
Head in the book.

745
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:08,759
Read the book,
mumble, over we go.

746
00:51:16,973 --> 00:51:18,201
I just wanted
to thank you.

747
00:51:18,275 --> 00:51:19,503
You don't owe me anything.

748
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:21,476
It's so rare that someone cares,
you know.

749
00:51:21,611 --> 00:51:24,079
-You didn't say I was weak.
-Well, you know, that's...

750
00:51:24,181 --> 00:51:25,944
And I think I'm going
to tell my wife...

751
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:27,380
just put it all at her feet.

752
00:51:27,451 --> 00:51:28,816
Well, that's a great idea.

753
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:31,615
Father, would you do me
the honor of shaking my hand?

754
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:32,619
-Sure.
-Thank you.

755
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:39,051
Let Fathers Brown
and Riley through.

756
00:51:39,162 --> 00:51:40,026
Thank you.

757
00:51:40,163 --> 00:51:41,994
Thank you, Father.

758
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:44,900
George!

759
00:51:45,035 --> 00:51:46,696
George!

760
00:51:46,837 --> 00:51:49,931
Stand over here!

761
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:51,665
Not there, here!

762
00:51:51,808 --> 00:51:55,471
Almost home free.
We're almost home free.

763
00:51:58,115 --> 00:51:59,514
Head in the book.
Head in the book.

764
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,246
Good day, Fathers.

765
00:52:05,322 --> 00:52:07,381
-Oh, no.
-What?

766
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:09,152
Oh, no, it's the warden.

767
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:12,519
No, no, don't run,
don't run, don't run.

768
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:13,891
It's okay. We're okay.
It's okay.

769
00:52:14,030 --> 00:52:15,429
It's okay.

770
00:52:15,532 --> 00:52:17,727
One more minute
and over we go.

771
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:19,359
I can't go back
to the joint, Ned.

772
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:21,266
You don't have to.
Just read the book.

773
00:52:26,443 --> 00:52:27,876
Fathers, I'm looking forward
to the Procession.

774
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:28,842
Oh, aren't we all?

775
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:29,744
Now, friends of mine tell me

776
00:52:29,779 --> 00:52:31,076
you two are the authors
of some pretty deep books.

777
00:52:31,448 --> 00:52:32,779
Well, you know,
it depends on your taste.

778
00:52:32,883 --> 00:52:34,441
Well, I'd like to read
them sometime if I could.

779
00:52:34,551 --> 00:52:36,041
I mean, I think of myself
as a good Catholic.

780
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:37,245
We'll send you some.

781
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:38,617
Yep. I did a little
writing myself once.

782
00:52:38,688 --> 00:52:39,488
Did you, now?
That's great.

783
00:52:39,523 --> 00:52:40,888
Yeah, but I didn't have
any luck selling it.

784
00:52:41,191 --> 00:52:42,658
I was just wondering
if you just might have

785
00:52:42,759 --> 00:52:43,525
a look at this for me...

786
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:46,620
Oh, my goodness!
Did we say our solemn prayer?

787
00:52:49,399 --> 00:52:50,491
We're busy right now.

788
00:52:50,567 --> 00:52:51,761
I understand.

789
00:52:59,543 --> 00:53:02,068
Gentlemen, it's all right.
Let them through.

790
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:03,806
Folks, let them pass, please.

791
00:53:03,947 --> 00:53:06,472
Father?

792
00:53:06,583 --> 00:53:07,413
Father.

793
00:53:14,624 --> 00:53:16,091
Just find them.

794
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:19,287
You instruct your men
to shoot on sight,

795
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:20,624
or at my command.

796
00:53:20,697 --> 00:53:23,359
$100 on the head
of each man, dead.

797
00:53:24,501 --> 00:53:25,866
-You understand that?
-Yeah.

798
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:26,866
$100.

799
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:30,339
Father? Father.

800
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:32,601
You didn't answer my question.

801
00:53:34,778 --> 00:53:36,507
You didn't answer my question.

802
00:53:36,646 --> 00:53:39,012
Is your shrine going
to cure my little girl?

803
00:53:40,584 --> 00:53:41,881
I mean, yous told me to be true,

804
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:43,076
and I thought about it,

805
00:53:43,153 --> 00:53:44,450
and I thought I would be true.

806
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:46,613
I-I'd be glad to be true.
What's in it for me?

807
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:47,918
You understand?
If I believe?

808
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:49,116
I can't talk to you now.

809
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:50,693
Well, you could talk
to me before,

810
00:53:50,794 --> 00:53:52,318
when all you had
was shame and all.

811
00:53:52,429 --> 00:53:53,521
Why can't you talk now?

812
00:53:53,597 --> 00:53:55,360
-Why can't you talk now?!
-You're making a scene.

813
00:53:55,498 --> 00:53:57,261
Hey, uh, what's that
compared to eternal life?

814
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,027
Well, they've gotta be
in this area,

815
00:53:59,169 --> 00:54:01,296
or they would have frozen
in the woods.

816
00:54:01,371 --> 00:54:02,235
You got a lot of spunk now.

817
00:54:02,372 --> 00:54:03,532
Why don't you just
get out of here!

818
00:54:03,607 --> 00:54:04,699
Will you beat it?!
Get out here!

819
00:54:04,774 --> 00:54:06,173
Screw you, Your Holiness!

820
00:54:06,276 --> 00:54:07,971
What, you think I didn't see
the way you looked at me...

821
00:54:08,111 --> 00:54:08,975
I said I'd go to bed with you?

822
00:54:09,112 --> 00:54:09,976
Will you...
for Christ's sake,

823
00:54:10,113 --> 00:54:11,205
will you shut up?

824
00:54:11,281 --> 00:54:12,646
What are you, too scared
or too cheap?

825
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:13,807
If God really made the world,

826
00:54:13,883 --> 00:54:15,180
he should have put
some men in it.

827
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:17,152
Look, you want to answer
my question for me?

828
00:54:17,287 --> 00:54:18,311
I... I can't do it.

829
00:54:18,388 --> 00:54:19,855
You want to lead us
to the shrine?

830
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:21,389
You want to wash
away our sins?

831
00:54:21,491 --> 00:54:22,480
I'm ready to change.

832
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:23,992
Go on, get this up!

833
00:54:25,462 --> 00:54:27,692
Damn you. Damn you.

834
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:29,425
I'm already damned, Father.

835
00:54:29,566 --> 00:54:30,863
I'm damned to hell for adultery.

836
00:54:31,034 --> 00:54:32,092
I'm damned for eternity.

837
00:54:32,168 --> 00:54:34,762
What's a little rudeness
going to get me, two more weeks?

838
00:54:34,871 --> 00:54:36,099
That's what I want to know.

839
00:54:36,172 --> 00:54:39,039
Everybody's saying how I...

840
00:54:55,692 --> 00:54:57,990
Go away. Get out.

841
00:54:58,094 --> 00:55:00,255
You had no business
to come to my room.

842
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:01,319
Get out of here.

843
00:55:01,398 --> 00:55:02,558
What, was that
the act of a man?

844
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:04,065
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Who are you? Who are you?

845
00:55:04,167 --> 00:55:05,395
You don't know
what your life is.

846
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:06,594
You don't know
what my life is.

847
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:07,796
Who are you?
Live your own life.

848
00:55:07,871 --> 00:55:08,735
Just live your own life!

849
00:55:08,872 --> 00:55:09,736
Hey, why don't you?

850
00:55:09,873 --> 00:55:11,500
Who the hell are you
to talk to me?

851
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:13,336
Why are you stuck up
in a monastery?

852
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:15,376
Watch my little girl.

853
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:33,693
We have a populace.

854
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:35,297
You do not have a populace.

855
00:55:35,398 --> 00:55:36,956
When I am gone,
you have a populace.

856
00:55:37,067 --> 00:55:38,830
Until then, all you've
got is a bunch of suspects.

857
00:55:39,035 --> 00:55:41,299
All right, how do we
get past the warden?

858
00:55:42,572 --> 00:55:44,062
She's deaf.

859
00:55:59,489 --> 00:56:01,184
Okay, okay.
We can do this. We can do this.

860
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:02,552
We just need a little thought.

861
00:56:02,625 --> 00:56:03,523
We need a plan.

862
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:04,991
We're not going to panic, huh?

863
00:56:10,767 --> 00:56:12,200
Every house, clear it out!

864
00:56:12,302 --> 00:56:13,326
Send in the dogs!

865
00:56:13,403 --> 00:56:15,098
-Smoke them out!
-Well, people live here.

866
00:56:15,238 --> 00:56:16,102
I don't give a goddamn!

867
00:56:16,239 --> 00:56:17,570
People can live here
when those men are dead.

868
00:56:17,674 --> 00:56:19,665
-Now, just go easy.
-Easy?!

869
00:56:19,743 --> 00:56:21,142
You've got the wrong man.

870
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:26,272
You got the convict clothing?

871
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:27,748
What? Huh? Yes.

872
00:56:27,851 --> 00:56:29,580
We're going to go
house to house.

873
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:31,209
Take some men around there.

874
00:56:31,321 --> 00:56:33,152
-Go, go around there.
-I'll do it.

875
00:56:33,289 --> 00:56:34,847
You stay here on the side
with me.

876
00:56:34,958 --> 00:56:36,118
Get the dogs, come on.

877
00:56:36,192 --> 00:56:39,093
Follow me. Follow me.
Over here. Over here, this way.

878
00:56:45,902 --> 00:56:48,530
I've been in tougher spots
than this before.

879
00:56:52,575 --> 00:56:53,872
He's over there!

880
00:56:55,779 --> 00:56:57,838
Easy, boy! Easy, boy!

881
00:57:04,654 --> 00:57:06,246
Who's in there?

882
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:33,541
Good evening.

883
00:57:33,616 --> 00:57:34,776
Hi, there.

884
00:57:34,851 --> 00:57:36,341
Good luck on the
lottery tomorrow.

885
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:37,715
Uh-huh.

886
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:39,778
You're not wearing any shoes.

887
00:57:39,856 --> 00:57:42,290
It brings us closer
to the earth.

888
00:58:08,885 --> 00:58:11,683
So this is the statue
that cries?

889
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:13,812
I guess it is.

890
00:58:15,725 --> 00:58:17,625
And what does it do?
It grants wishes?

891
00:58:27,270 --> 00:58:29,397
I know what
I'd wish for right now.

892
00:58:30,607 --> 00:58:34,099
I'd wish for two
new pairs of shoes.

893
00:58:38,047 --> 00:58:42,347
Please, lady, give me and Ned,
two new pairs of shoes.

894
00:59:30,366 --> 00:59:32,163
I say we try
the river tonight, Ned.

895
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:33,968
Yeah, what do we do,
walk on the water?

896
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:36,334
Steal a boat?

897
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:40,399
They got the waterfront sewed up
tighter than a football.

898
00:59:40,476 --> 00:59:42,467
Hey, what are you...?
Wait. We're not going back?!

899
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:44,137
I mean, Bob...
Bob got across.

900
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:46,646
You don't know
that Bobby got across.

901
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:49,240
We got to believe that, Ned.
We got to.

902
00:59:49,352 --> 00:59:50,216
We do?

903
00:59:51,354 --> 00:59:52,753
Why?

904
00:59:52,855 --> 00:59:56,222
Because if we don't,
what are we going to believe?

905
01:00:18,548 --> 01:00:20,379
Where you going?

906
01:00:22,485 --> 01:00:24,077
To prayers and dinner.

907
01:00:57,286 --> 01:00:58,446
Get back!

908
01:00:58,521 --> 01:01:00,148
Get back!

909
01:01:00,289 --> 01:01:02,314
I'm telling you,
nobody lives here

910
01:01:02,392 --> 01:01:03,984
except for the goddamned...

911
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:05,526
the bugs.

912
01:01:07,964 --> 01:01:10,660
Lady, I know you think
I'm a bad guy, but I know...

913
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:14,031
and I know you been watching me.
but I'm not a bad person.

914
01:01:14,103 --> 01:01:17,698
Please, don't...
don't let them take me back.

915
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:20,206
Please don't let them
take me back.

916
01:01:20,309 --> 01:01:22,209
Please...

917
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:50,529
The Weeping Madonna.

918
01:01:50,606 --> 01:01:53,769
Oh. Hello, Father.

919
01:01:53,843 --> 01:01:55,401
That's the wonderful thing

920
01:01:55,511 --> 01:01:58,571
about what you've written...
you and your friend.

921
01:01:58,648 --> 01:01:59,842
We must never forget

922
01:01:59,916 --> 01:02:02,214
that it's simply
a hole in the roof.

923
01:02:08,624 --> 01:02:11,218
That's why we were
so glad you could come.

924
01:02:13,296 --> 01:02:14,558
You know, your notion

925
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:18,896
on the true meaning
of a miracle...

926
01:02:18,968 --> 01:02:22,267
well, I just want to thank you.

927
01:02:23,639 --> 01:02:26,904
I'm sorry if I disturbed you.

928
01:02:26,976 --> 01:02:29,843
Ah, well, uh, no,
I was just, uh...

929
01:02:29,979 --> 01:02:32,709
The word you're looking for
is "praying," I believe.

930
01:02:37,987 --> 01:02:40,683
It's not easy being
a priest all the time.

931
01:02:40,823 --> 01:02:42,256
I understand.

932
01:02:43,493 --> 01:02:44,892
Don't worry.

933
01:02:44,994 --> 01:02:47,292
It'll be all right,
my son.

934
01:02:50,833 --> 01:02:52,232
S-Sometimes it...

935
01:02:52,335 --> 01:02:53,734
Yes?

936
01:02:53,836 --> 01:02:55,929
Some...

937
01:02:56,005 --> 01:02:57,563
Sometimes I...

938
01:02:57,673 --> 01:02:59,072
It doesn't
help though.

939
01:02:59,175 --> 01:03:00,472
Mm-hmm.

940
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:03,704
There is no help.

941
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:05,509
Did you ask Her?

942
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:10,009
I suppose I did.

943
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:11,552
For what?

944
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:16,550
For help to get from one place
to another place.

945
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:20,888
Well...

946
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:23,864
She's never let me down.

947
01:03:35,144 --> 01:03:38,011
Will you be marching
in the Procession tomorrow?

948
01:03:38,147 --> 01:03:41,412
Well, Father, in truth,
I have other things to do.

949
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:43,884
I understand.

950
01:03:43,986 --> 01:03:46,420
That is a long walk into Canada.

951
01:03:51,561 --> 01:03:53,825
Into Canada?

952
01:03:55,164 --> 01:03:57,462
Yes, it's a long walk
all the way,

953
01:03:57,567 --> 01:03:59,660
with the Shrine, into Canada.

954
01:04:04,273 --> 01:04:05,672
Are we still doing that?

955
01:04:05,775 --> 01:04:06,639
What?

956
01:04:06,776 --> 01:04:07,868
Carry... uh,
we're carrying it?

957
01:04:07,944 --> 01:04:10,640
Carrying it...
the thing... into Canada?

958
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:12,179
Yes, we're still doing it...

959
01:04:12,281 --> 01:04:13,976
across the bridge
to our sister church

960
01:04:14,116 --> 01:04:15,378
on the Canadian side.

961
01:04:35,471 --> 01:04:37,063
Okay, thank you.

962
01:04:40,810 --> 01:04:42,209
I changed my mind.

963
01:04:42,311 --> 01:04:44,142
I want to march
in the Procession.

964
01:04:47,316 --> 01:04:48,783
It's too late.

965
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:50,079
What do you mean, too late?

966
01:04:50,152 --> 01:04:51,710
You're late.
You're a day late.

967
01:04:51,821 --> 01:04:53,186
Well, we got delayed.

968
01:04:56,492 --> 01:04:58,050
They just closed up the list.

969
01:04:58,160 --> 01:04:59,718
Well, open the list up.

970
01:04:59,829 --> 01:05:01,023
Can't do it.

971
01:05:01,097 --> 01:05:03,657
What do you mean,
you can't do it?

972
01:05:03,766 --> 01:05:05,199
Can't do it.

973
01:05:06,269 --> 01:05:08,396
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

974
01:05:09,605 --> 01:05:11,436
You want me
to go above your head?

975
01:05:14,944 --> 01:05:17,208
He doesn't understand
the meaning of the phrase.

976
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:18,212
Uh-huh. He doesn't?

977
01:05:18,247 --> 01:05:19,646
It means, I'm going
to go to the head man.

978
01:05:19,949 --> 01:05:21,507
I'm going to rat you out.
I got a problem.

979
01:05:21,617 --> 01:05:23,175
I got a right to march
in that Procession.

980
01:05:23,286 --> 01:05:25,516
Now, you sign me up!

981
01:05:42,471 --> 01:05:44,735
This is not
a Christian attitude.

982
01:05:44,807 --> 01:05:45,899
You know what?

983
01:05:45,975 --> 01:05:47,340
You tell him, tough!

984
01:05:51,814 --> 01:05:54,578
He says that there is, uh,
something wrong about you.

985
01:05:54,717 --> 01:05:57,242
Yeah? You tell him
he don't know the half of it,

986
01:05:57,353 --> 01:05:59,150
unless he puts my name
on that list.

987
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:12,692
All right.

988
01:06:14,870 --> 01:06:16,735
Who will your afflicted be?

989
01:06:16,872 --> 01:06:18,100
I'm sorry?

990
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:22,709
He says,
"Are you deaf?"

991
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:24,439
Who will your afflicted be?

992
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:27,014
Afflicted?

993
01:06:27,116 --> 01:06:29,209
Who will be the afflicted person

994
01:06:29,285 --> 01:06:31,310
you will be
escorting in prayer

995
01:06:31,387 --> 01:06:33,685
for the intercession
of the Virgin?

996
01:06:33,789 --> 01:06:36,622
Why, we just thought
we'd be going ourselves.

997
01:06:42,631 --> 01:06:43,996
Yes. Yes, that...

998
01:06:45,301 --> 01:06:46,825
Yes. That's lovely.

999
01:06:46,936 --> 01:06:50,072
Let's live our lives
with no rules at all.

1000
01:06:50,107 --> 01:06:53,064
Now, who will be the sick
or crippled

1001
01:06:53,409 --> 01:06:58,176
or disabled person whom
you will be escorting across?

1002
01:07:24,673 --> 01:07:26,072
Hey.

1003
01:07:31,447 --> 01:07:32,311
Where's your mother?

1004
01:07:32,448 --> 01:07:34,313
Where's your mother?

1005
01:07:34,450 --> 01:07:36,714
Where's your mother? Huh?

1006
01:07:36,786 --> 01:07:38,879
Where's Mommy?

1007
01:07:51,801 --> 01:07:53,063
Ah! Mr. Holiness.

1008
01:07:53,135 --> 01:07:53,965
Let me help you with this.

1009
01:07:54,103 --> 01:07:55,229
Oh, no. I don't need your help.

1010
01:07:55,304 --> 01:07:56,532
I want to ask you something.

1011
01:07:56,605 --> 01:07:58,197
What, you want to take me
upstairs for a ride?

1012
01:07:58,307 --> 01:07:59,171
You've got your nerve.

1013
01:07:59,308 --> 01:08:01,105
Yeah. Yeah! I'm a sinner.

1014
01:08:01,243 --> 01:08:02,335
Oh. Big of you to say so.

1015
01:08:02,411 --> 01:08:03,275
But I want to change.

1016
01:08:03,412 --> 01:08:04,674
Oh. Good luck.

1017
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:07,147
I want to take your little girl
on the Procession of the Shrine.

1018
01:08:07,249 --> 01:08:08,113
You go to hell!

1019
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:09,114
Why, what's the matter?

1020
01:08:09,251 --> 01:08:10,616
You don't believe
in Divine Grace?

1021
01:08:10,719 --> 01:08:11,617
I told you, piss off!

1022
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:13,153
I don't... I don't
need your magic show.

1023
01:08:13,255 --> 01:08:14,882
If God wants to take
your little girl...

1024
01:08:15,024 --> 01:08:17,322
Hey, I told you, I don't want
your goddamn mumbo jumbo,

1025
01:08:17,426 --> 01:08:19,121
and I won't let you
curse my kid with it.

1026
01:08:19,261 --> 01:08:20,660
Wait a second. Please.
Please. Please.

1027
01:08:20,763 --> 01:08:22,162
Isn't there anything...

1028
01:08:22,264 --> 01:08:24,824
Isn't there anything which
would change your mind?

1029
01:08:24,934 --> 01:08:27,027
What could I do
to change your mind?

1030
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:28,798
I'll tell you what
would convince me.

1031
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:30,064
What?

1032
01:08:44,286 --> 01:08:45,548
Jimmy. Jim...

1033
01:08:45,621 --> 01:08:47,714
Father Brown?

1034
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:49,314
Father Brown.

1035
01:08:49,425 --> 01:08:51,017
Hey, Ned.

1036
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:52,389
I have to talk to you.

1037
01:08:52,461 --> 01:08:55,157
Is there anything else
I should know, I mean, at all?

1038
01:08:55,297 --> 01:08:56,525
Is this too scratchy?

1039
01:08:56,599 --> 01:08:58,157
Jimmy!

1040
01:08:58,267 --> 01:08:59,165
You get used to it.

1041
01:08:59,301 --> 01:09:00,393
I have to talk to you.

1042
01:09:00,469 --> 01:09:01,663
-Not now, Ned.
-Jimmy!

1043
01:09:01,737 --> 01:09:03,398
I've got to work, okay?
I made my mind up.

1044
01:09:03,539 --> 01:09:04,403
What, what?

1045
01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:05,837
I'm going to check
into a deal here.

1046
01:09:05,908 --> 01:09:07,000
What deal?

1047
01:09:07,076 --> 01:09:08,373
Father Brown was going
to join our order.

1048
01:09:08,477 --> 01:09:09,341
What?!

1049
01:09:09,478 --> 01:09:10,570
It's three squares and a cot.

1050
01:09:10,646 --> 01:09:11,772
Jimmy!

1051
01:09:11,847 --> 01:09:14,315
I told you, Ned,
I'm not going back in.

1052
01:09:14,416 --> 01:09:15,815
I got the way out, Jimmy.

1053
01:09:15,918 --> 01:09:17,010
I got the way out!

1054
01:09:17,086 --> 01:09:18,110
-You do?
-Yeah!

1055
01:09:18,187 --> 01:09:19,313
We're about 300 feet
from freedom,

1056
01:09:19,388 --> 01:09:20,252
and I can get us across.

1057
01:09:20,389 --> 01:09:21,549
Don't go native on me now.

1058
01:09:21,624 --> 01:09:24,149
What are you trying to do,
shine on my pal, huh?

1059
01:09:24,260 --> 01:09:25,693
Changed our minds.

1060
01:09:25,794 --> 01:09:27,659
Sorry, changed our mind.

1061
01:09:27,796 --> 01:09:29,457
I can't believe it, Ned...
they're going to catch us.

1062
01:09:29,598 --> 01:09:30,997
No, no, I promise you.

1063
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:35,002
No. All we need's a hundred
bucks off that shrine out there.

1064
01:09:45,181 --> 01:09:46,978
Now, when the
Procession starts,

1065
01:09:47,116 --> 01:09:50,210
I am going to be holding
onto a part of the float.

1066
01:09:50,286 --> 01:09:51,150
Okay, good, good.

1067
01:09:51,287 --> 01:09:52,845
Then Father Levesque will say,

1068
01:09:52,955 --> 01:09:54,820
"Suffer the little children
to come unto me. "

1069
01:09:54,957 --> 01:09:56,891
Here, take one of these.

1070
01:09:56,926 --> 01:09:59,588
-Then I will hold out my hands,
-Uh-huh.

1071
01:09:59,628 --> 01:10:04,156
then you will come
forward with the child,

1072
01:10:04,633 --> 01:10:06,032
bring the afflicted
child forward...

1073
01:10:06,135 --> 01:10:07,227
Right.

1074
01:10:07,303 --> 01:10:10,397
...so that the child...
so that the child can join

1075
01:10:10,472 --> 01:10:12,337
the group of
afflicted children.

1076
01:10:13,642 --> 01:10:15,200
I'm trying to explain
these rules to you,

1077
01:10:15,311 --> 01:10:16,642
Yeah, I'm listening,
I'm listening.

1078
01:10:16,745 --> 01:10:18,303
so that you will be
able to follow them

1079
01:10:18,414 --> 01:10:21,076
when the time comes.
Good, okay, good.

1080
01:10:21,217 --> 01:10:24,311
Then, the child will
stand in the group.

1081
01:10:24,386 --> 01:10:26,013
-You will stand near the child
-Okay, okay.

1082
01:10:26,155 --> 01:10:28,851
and wait for the signal
from Father Levesque.

1083
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:30,252
-Okay, good, good.
-Are you following this,

1084
01:10:30,326 --> 01:10:31,190
Yes, I'm listening.

1085
01:10:31,327 --> 01:10:32,589
because we won't be
able to discuss it

1086
01:10:32,661 --> 01:10:33,650
-at the time.
-Uh-huh, okay, okay.

1087
01:10:33,729 --> 01:10:34,787
We can only discuss it now.

1088
01:10:34,863 --> 01:10:37,058
Hail Mary.

1089
01:10:48,744 --> 01:10:49,938
-Now, first,
-Okay.

1090
01:10:50,012 --> 01:10:52,105
we will all gather
into the square,

1091
01:10:53,349 --> 01:10:54,680
and then there will
be the brass band,

1092
01:10:54,783 --> 01:10:56,546
and the children's choir
will say the "Ave Maria,"

1093
01:10:57,853 --> 01:10:59,115
and then they will raise
the crucifix,

1094
01:11:00,189 --> 01:11:01,679
the altar boys will gather,

1095
01:11:01,790 --> 01:11:04,657
Father Levesque will raise
his hand, and then you say what?

1096
01:11:04,793 --> 01:11:07,887
I say, "Follow,"

1097
01:11:07,963 --> 01:11:11,228
uh... "I will pray
for the inter...

1098
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:14,394
"inter... in-inter... in-int...

1099
01:11:14,470 --> 01:11:15,334
The intercession.

1100
01:11:15,471 --> 01:11:17,871
...intercession
of the unfortunates. "

1101
01:11:17,973 --> 01:11:19,235
-Yes.
-You got my money?

1102
01:11:19,308 --> 01:11:20,707
Excuse me?

1103
01:11:20,809 --> 01:11:21,901
You got my money?

1104
01:11:21,977 --> 01:11:23,569
The Procession's starting
in 15 minutes.

1105
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:24,737
What's this? Excuse me,

1106
01:11:24,813 --> 01:11:26,682
aren't we going to
finish discussing this?

1107
01:11:26,717 --> 01:11:28,377
Yeah, it's going
to be fine, will ya?

1108
01:11:28,684 --> 01:11:30,208
Hey, you are one
money-grubbing bitch!

1109
01:11:30,319 --> 01:11:31,411
What's the matter with you?!

1110
01:11:31,487 --> 01:11:33,182
Whatever, but the kid
don't march in the parade

1111
01:11:33,322 --> 01:11:34,414
without I get
a hundred bucks.

1112
01:11:34,490 --> 01:11:35,582
Hey, you're going
to get your money!

1113
01:11:35,658 --> 01:11:36,392
You're going to get
your goddamn money!

1114
01:11:36,427 --> 01:11:37,222
How'd you get this way?!

1115
01:11:37,660 --> 01:11:39,355
None of your business.
What are you to me?

1116
01:11:39,495 --> 01:11:40,359
What are you to me?
Nothing.

1117
01:11:40,496 --> 01:11:41,360
What? You want me to pray?

1118
01:11:41,497 --> 01:11:42,361
You want me to screw?

1119
01:11:42,498 --> 01:11:44,591
You want me to march
in the parade? Pay me.

1120
01:11:44,667 --> 01:11:46,532
Nice talk in front
of your kid, huh?

1121
01:11:46,669 --> 01:11:49,035
She can't hear you.
She's deaf.

1122
01:11:53,375 --> 01:11:55,900
They shot him!

1123
01:11:56,078 --> 01:11:57,306
They shot him!

1124
01:11:57,379 --> 01:11:58,437
They shot who?
They shot who?

1125
01:11:58,514 --> 01:12:00,106
The one they were
looking for, the convict.

1126
01:12:00,249 --> 01:12:01,511
He was trying
to steal the money.

1127
01:12:01,583 --> 01:12:02,481
Jimmy.

1128
01:12:13,095 --> 01:12:14,460
They shot the convict!

1129
01:12:14,763 --> 01:12:16,196
They shot the convict!

1130
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:20,063
He tried to get away,
but they shot him.

1131
01:12:20,202 --> 01:12:22,432
They shot the convict.

1132
01:12:22,504 --> 01:12:23,804
Oh. Where? Where? Where?

1133
01:12:23,839 --> 01:12:25,397
Well, he ran inside
the general store.

1134
01:12:25,641 --> 01:12:27,734
Well, they chased him
inside the general store,

1135
01:12:27,810 --> 01:12:29,038
and he tried to get a gun.

1136
01:12:32,081 --> 01:12:36,541
Move! Move! Move! Move!
Move! Move! Move!

1137
01:12:36,852 --> 01:12:39,218
-Move! Move!
-Coming through!

1138
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:41,448
Warden, I was just about to...

1139
01:12:49,865 --> 01:12:51,162
Send for the doc.

1140
01:12:51,266 --> 01:12:54,133
Get some more men over here.

1141
01:12:54,269 --> 01:12:56,260
It's him.

1142
01:12:56,372 --> 01:12:58,237
We've got our convict.

1143
01:13:06,715 --> 01:13:09,240
I think he needs a priest.

1144
01:13:13,055 --> 01:13:16,149
I'm a priest.

1145
01:13:24,967 --> 01:13:27,595
Father... Father,
I've been shot.

1146
01:13:27,736 --> 01:13:29,294
I'm very happy for you.

1147
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:30,702
He was trying to steal.

1148
01:13:30,773 --> 01:13:32,104
I saw him over
by the gun case...

1149
01:13:32,207 --> 01:13:33,538
Come on, come on,
get him out here.

1150
01:13:33,642 --> 01:13:34,541
Get him locked up.

1151
01:13:34,576 --> 01:13:36,100
If he's gonna die,
let him die in jail!

1152
01:13:36,412 --> 01:13:38,004
It's a priest!
It's a priest!

1153
01:13:38,147 --> 01:13:40,047
Let him through.

1154
01:13:43,218 --> 01:13:45,618
Jimmy, I'm so sorry... I told you
we got to get out of here.

1155
01:13:45,721 --> 01:13:47,814
What the hell are you talking
about? I ain't gonna die!

1156
01:13:47,890 --> 01:13:50,222
Get this goddamn priest
out of here!

1157
01:13:50,325 --> 01:13:51,986
Bobby.

1158
01:13:54,363 --> 01:13:56,524
This man is on his last leg.
Come on, hurry up!

1159
01:13:56,598 --> 01:13:58,657
Get out of the way,
get out of the way, move back.

1160
01:13:58,734 --> 01:14:00,531
Come on, get that goddamn thing
in here.

1161
01:14:00,669 --> 01:14:01,966
All right. Gently, men, gently.

1162
01:14:02,037 --> 01:14:04,335
Get him down.
Come on, get him down there.

1163
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:05,964
Now, look,
he gives you any sass,

1164
01:14:06,074 --> 01:14:07,098
you let him drown

1165
01:14:07,176 --> 01:14:08,165
in his own blood.

1166
01:14:08,243 --> 01:14:09,437
Ned?

1167
01:14:09,511 --> 01:14:11,578
Ned?

1168
01:14:11,613 --> 01:14:13,046
Wait a minute. Wait a minute!

1169
01:14:13,348 --> 01:14:15,509
Get me that priest.
Get me that priest!

1170
01:14:15,584 --> 01:14:16,778
I want to talk
to that priest.

1171
01:14:16,852 --> 01:14:19,047
Father, this way now.

1172
01:14:19,121 --> 01:14:20,588
I want to confess my sins!

1173
01:14:20,689 --> 01:14:23,886
You son of a bitch, ain't there
a Christian among you?!

1174
01:14:23,959 --> 01:14:25,426
All right, Father, this way.

1175
01:14:25,527 --> 01:14:27,427
He don't look that sick.

1176
01:14:30,365 --> 01:14:31,627
Excuse me.

1177
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:33,167
I don't think he's religious.

1178
01:14:33,268 --> 01:14:35,862
Get me that priest!

1179
01:14:50,953 --> 01:14:53,251
Forgive this poor boy
for what he did.

1180
01:14:53,322 --> 01:14:54,721
He knew not what he did.

1181
01:14:54,823 --> 01:14:56,723
Deliver him from evil. Amen.

1182
01:14:56,859 --> 01:14:58,918
But let him... let him...

1183
01:14:59,061 --> 01:15:00,653
let his soul rest
in some peace

1184
01:15:00,762 --> 01:15:03,128
for all the terrible
sins he did.

1185
01:15:03,232 --> 01:15:04,631
He... he was a bad person,

1186
01:15:04,733 --> 01:15:07,327
but-but he-he repents
for his sins.

1187
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:10,336
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

1188
01:15:11,507 --> 01:15:13,065
I thought you were dead.

1189
01:15:13,175 --> 01:15:16,042
It's been a long time
since my last confession.

1190
01:15:16,178 --> 01:15:18,806
Yeah, but why'd you have
to shoot that deputy, Bob?

1191
01:15:18,981 --> 01:15:20,642
Cut the comedy, huh? You
would've done the same thing.

1192
01:15:20,782 --> 01:15:21,976
I'm not asking you
where you got

1193
01:15:22,050 --> 01:15:23,677
the priest togs, am I?
That's your business.

1194
01:15:23,819 --> 01:15:26,549
Just tell me
how we get out of here.

1195
01:15:32,294 --> 01:15:35,161
I'm sorry for you, Bob.

1196
01:15:35,297 --> 01:15:38,130
You're what?

1197
01:15:38,267 --> 01:15:42,135
You stand to gaff for the men
you shot... I am so sorry...

1198
01:15:42,271 --> 01:15:44,000
and if there's anything
I could do

1199
01:15:44,139 --> 01:15:46,039
to make you more comfortable...

1200
01:15:48,043 --> 01:15:50,102
What, are you joking?

1201
01:15:50,345 --> 01:15:51,607
What can I do, Bob?

1202
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:53,272
You know, hey...

1203
01:15:58,020 --> 01:16:00,853
You.

1204
01:16:00,989 --> 01:16:05,756
Doc says you're going to live
long enough for us to fry you.

1205
01:16:05,894 --> 01:16:08,294
Escape from prison,

1206
01:16:08,397 --> 01:16:12,390
murder of two guards...

1207
01:16:12,467 --> 01:16:14,935
murderous assault
on an officer...

1208
01:16:16,338 --> 01:16:18,169
Now, Father, you finish up here.

1209
01:16:18,307 --> 01:16:21,902
I'm coming back in here
in five minutes...

1210
01:16:22,044 --> 01:16:25,070
and then you're going to tell me
where those other two men are.

1211
01:16:31,653 --> 01:16:33,348
That's right.

1212
01:16:33,488 --> 01:16:34,750
What can I do, Bob?

1213
01:16:34,823 --> 01:16:36,450
What can I do to get you
out of here? What can I do?

1214
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:38,457
I don't know, but you better do
it, or I'm gonna turn you in.

1215
01:16:38,594 --> 01:16:40,619
-They'll send us back inside.
-Inside?

1216
01:16:40,696 --> 01:16:41,890
No, you won't be going
back inside.

1217
01:16:41,997 --> 01:16:44,192
I rat you out, we're all gonna
fry for those guards we shot.

1218
01:16:44,266 --> 01:16:46,860
Ex-Excuse me?

1219
01:16:46,969 --> 01:16:49,767
Excuse me, excuse me,
you shot the guards, Bob.

1220
01:16:49,905 --> 01:16:51,167
You shot the guards.

1221
01:16:51,239 --> 01:16:53,469
No, I think not.
I think you shot the guards.

1222
01:16:53,542 --> 01:16:56,841
Oh, no, no.
You shot the guards, Bob.

1223
01:16:56,912 --> 01:16:58,777
No, I think you shot them.

1224
01:16:58,914 --> 01:17:00,745
I think that
you shot the guards,

1225
01:17:00,882 --> 01:17:04,181
and I think that that's going
to be my dying confession.

1226
01:17:07,022 --> 01:17:10,355
So, what are you going to do
to get me across that border?

1227
01:18:07,082 --> 01:18:09,414
Father, are you about done?

1228
01:18:13,255 --> 01:18:15,155
I believe he's dying.

1229
01:18:16,558 --> 01:18:18,856
I'm going back...
I have to get another priest

1230
01:18:18,994 --> 01:18:21,224
to help me administer
the last rites.

1231
01:18:21,296 --> 01:18:23,958
Well, we'll be upstairs, Father.

1232
01:18:36,378 --> 01:18:38,107
Santa Maria

1233
01:19:03,138 --> 01:19:04,696
Here, put this on.

1234
01:19:04,806 --> 01:19:06,205
I couldn't get
the hundred bucks.

1235
01:19:06,308 --> 01:19:07,775
Where the hell you been?

1236
01:19:07,876 --> 01:19:09,537
-Bobby's in the slammer.
-What?

1237
01:19:09,678 --> 01:19:10,702
Yeah. He's in the jail.

1238
01:19:10,779 --> 01:19:12,076
He shot a cop,
and they shot him.

1239
01:19:12,180 --> 01:19:13,238
They got him here?

1240
01:19:13,315 --> 01:19:14,577
Look, he saw me,
he knows we're here.

1241
01:19:14,649 --> 01:19:16,446
He says he's gonna rat us out
unless we help him escape.

1242
01:19:16,585 --> 01:19:17,609
We have to take him with us.

1243
01:19:17,686 --> 01:19:18,778
I don't get it.

1244
01:19:18,854 --> 01:19:20,845
-He says he's gonna rat us out?
-Yeah, yeah.

1245
01:19:20,922 --> 01:19:23,015
Well... well,
let him rot in there.

1246
01:19:23,091 --> 01:19:24,115
I'm way ahead of you...
he says

1247
01:19:24,192 --> 01:19:25,682
either he sees us
coming back to save him,

1248
01:19:25,794 --> 01:19:27,489
or he blows the whistle
before we can get across.

1249
01:19:27,629 --> 01:19:28,653
He's giving us five minutes.

1250
01:19:28,764 --> 01:19:30,629
How are we gonna get across?

1251
01:19:30,766 --> 01:19:31,960
I have no idea.

1252
01:19:56,391 --> 01:19:59,690
Amen.

1253
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:04,098
And now,
as is traditional at this time,

1254
01:20:04,366 --> 01:20:06,391
before our Procession,

1255
01:20:06,468 --> 01:20:08,902
we will have the drawing
of our lottery.

1256
01:20:17,045 --> 01:20:20,173
And now I call up
to stand beside me...

1257
01:20:21,983 --> 01:20:24,816
Ah. Father Brown.

1258
01:20:26,955 --> 01:20:28,855
Father Brown?

1259
01:20:30,492 --> 01:20:32,585
Father Brown?

1260
01:20:32,661 --> 01:20:34,060
There he is!

1261
01:20:34,162 --> 01:20:36,357
There he is... Father Brown.

1262
01:20:39,401 --> 01:20:41,892
It's another...
it's another Father Brown.

1263
01:20:42,070 --> 01:20:44,561
No, no, no, it's...
it's another Father Brown.

1264
01:20:44,673 --> 01:20:47,335
It's another Father Brown.
It's not this one.

1265
01:20:47,475 --> 01:20:50,171
Ned...

1266
01:21:28,984 --> 01:21:30,315
Father Brown.

1267
01:21:37,525 --> 01:21:40,323
I never won anything before.

1268
01:21:42,964 --> 01:21:44,261
I'm really anxious
to get back down there

1269
01:21:44,366 --> 01:21:47,767
so the Procession will go on.

1270
01:21:47,903 --> 01:21:51,669
It is with great happiness that
I present to you, Father Brown,

1271
01:21:51,806 --> 01:21:54,366
whom, we may say,
the hand of God himself,

1272
01:21:54,476 --> 01:21:55,675
has chosen to deliver

1273
01:21:55,710 --> 01:21:57,940
this year's sermon on the
miraculous properties

1274
01:21:58,179 --> 01:21:59,874
of the Shrine
of the Weeping Virgin.

1275
01:22:00,015 --> 01:22:02,313
Father Brown.

1276
01:22:33,715 --> 01:22:34,704
Oh, God...

1277
01:22:56,671 --> 01:23:00,471
"Have you ever felt
completely alone?

1278
01:23:00,608 --> 01:23:02,269
"Alone in a world

1279
01:23:02,410 --> 01:23:07,143
"of danger, and no one
to rely on?

1280
01:23:17,993 --> 01:23:24,934
"Danger on every hand,
in a world fraught with danger,

1281
01:23:29,304 --> 01:23:35,106
"and at the brink of death,
I felt in my pocket,

1282
01:23:35,243 --> 01:23:39,407
and what did I find?"

1283
01:23:44,552 --> 01:23:47,817
What did I find?

1284
01:23:58,767 --> 01:24:00,234
Nothing.

1285
01:24:03,371 --> 01:24:05,771
There's nothing there.

1286
01:24:08,476 --> 01:24:10,239
It's all in your head.

1287
01:24:15,050 --> 01:24:17,746
Well, they can take the money
from you.

1288
01:24:18,053 --> 01:24:21,511
They can take the position
from you.

1289
01:24:21,623 --> 01:24:25,081
I don't know, they can whip you.

1290
01:24:25,193 --> 01:24:29,357
People turn their back on you.

1291
01:24:29,431 --> 01:24:33,765
Everything happens to everybody.

1292
01:24:33,868 --> 01:24:35,165
And you ain't gonna find nothing
in your pocket

1293
01:24:35,270 --> 01:24:36,886
that can stave it off.

1294
01:24:36,921 --> 01:24:38,502
Nothing can stave it off.

1295
01:24:38,740 --> 01:24:40,571
Pain...

1296
01:24:40,708 --> 01:24:44,906
affliction... we say "power. "

1297
01:24:45,013 --> 01:24:46,640
Power doesn't do it.

1298
01:24:46,781 --> 01:24:48,908
"Cause you'll never have enough.

1299
01:24:49,084 --> 01:24:50,551
Money?

1300
01:24:50,652 --> 01:24:51,516
I don't know.

1301
01:24:51,653 --> 01:24:53,245
You know anybody who has enough?

1302
01:24:53,354 --> 01:24:56,118
Still, trouble befalls us.

1303
01:24:56,257 --> 01:25:00,956
Everyone has that sadness
in their heart.

1304
01:25:03,531 --> 01:25:06,830
Some people are meant
to be hard.

1305
01:25:07,001 --> 01:25:08,992
I don't know.

1306
01:25:09,104 --> 01:25:10,366
It seems like they are.

1307
01:25:10,472 --> 01:25:12,565
We meet them.

1308
01:25:18,446 --> 01:25:21,643
Is God good?

1309
01:25:21,716 --> 01:25:24,776
I don't know.

1310
01:25:24,853 --> 01:25:29,051
All I know is...

1311
01:25:29,124 --> 01:25:32,821
something might give you
comfort.

1312
01:25:33,027 --> 01:25:36,463
And maybe you deserve it.

1313
01:25:38,366 --> 01:25:43,770
If it comforts you,
to believe in God, you do it.

1314
01:25:43,872 --> 01:25:45,965
That's your business.

1315
01:25:49,811 --> 01:25:54,214
People have guilty...

1316
01:25:54,315 --> 01:25:56,943
you know...

1317
01:25:57,085 --> 01:25:58,677
guilty secrets.

1318
01:26:04,058 --> 01:26:09,928
But if that's yours, that you
want to go believe in something?

1319
01:26:13,234 --> 01:26:15,794
Well, that's not so bad.

1320
01:27:24,505 --> 01:27:26,063
All right.

1321
01:27:26,174 --> 01:27:27,072
I don't want your money.

1322
01:27:27,242 --> 01:27:29,233
Just take the kid
on the Procession

1323
01:27:29,310 --> 01:27:30,299
and pray for her.

1324
01:27:30,378 --> 01:27:32,938
And just you be careful
and hold her hand.

1325
01:27:40,822 --> 01:27:43,848
What's this?

1326
01:27:43,925 --> 01:27:46,155
This is our ticket
across the bridge.

1327
01:27:50,198 --> 01:27:52,098
We got to get out of here.
We got ten seconds.

1328
01:27:52,267 --> 01:27:53,666
Ten seconds.

1329
01:27:53,768 --> 01:27:55,292
Don't move!
Don't move!

1330
01:27:55,403 --> 01:27:57,394
If there's any trouble,
I'm coming out shooting.

1331
01:27:57,472 --> 01:27:59,030
If there's any trouble,
it's too late.

1332
01:27:59,140 --> 01:28:00,630
Trust me, you'll be
the first to go.

1333
01:28:02,810 --> 01:28:04,038
What's he doing here?

1334
01:28:10,418 --> 01:28:11,817
How'd Bob get here?

1335
01:28:11,919 --> 01:28:12,783
I'll tell you later.

1336
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:13,818
Come on, let's get
out of here.

1337
01:28:58,633 --> 01:29:02,501
They, uh, take the Madonna
that belongs partly to us

1338
01:29:02,637 --> 01:29:05,128
and the sister parish
across the river in Canada,

1339
01:29:05,239 --> 01:29:08,265
and the priests, they just
walk it over there and...

1340
01:30:29,724 --> 01:30:31,316
He's gone!

1341
01:30:31,459 --> 01:30:33,120
He's gone!

1342
01:30:36,898 --> 01:30:38,365
Tell those men
to go down to the river.

1343
01:30:38,466 --> 01:30:39,728
Yes, sir.

1344
01:30:39,801 --> 01:30:41,666
Come on, let's go.

1345
01:30:47,508 --> 01:30:48,372
Oh, Warden.

1346
01:30:48,509 --> 01:30:49,567
I'm so sorry.

1347
01:30:55,283 --> 01:30:59,185
For all those who labor
and are heavily laden.

1348
01:31:06,294 --> 01:31:09,092
My God.

1349
01:31:21,709 --> 01:31:24,542
Nobody move!

1350
01:31:27,114 --> 01:31:29,014
Hey, come back here.

1351
01:31:32,587 --> 01:31:35,112
Any trouble...

1352
01:31:35,223 --> 01:31:36,690
Not the girl, Bob, not the girl!

1353
01:31:36,791 --> 01:31:37,655
Shut up!

1354
01:31:37,792 --> 01:31:39,657
Molly! Molly!

1355
01:31:39,794 --> 01:31:41,921
Molly! Molly! Molly!

1356
01:31:42,029 --> 01:31:43,496
No! No!

1357
01:31:43,598 --> 01:31:44,895
Get her.

1358
01:31:46,067 --> 01:31:46,863
No!

1359
01:31:47,068 --> 01:31:48,228
Rosie!

1360
01:31:48,302 --> 01:31:50,600
Damn, just let me go.

1361
01:32:17,298 --> 01:32:19,926
So long.

1362
01:32:31,679 --> 01:32:34,944
No! No!

1363
01:32:36,951 --> 01:32:38,282
No!

1364
01:32:38,386 --> 01:32:39,478
Rosie!

1365
01:32:41,122 --> 01:32:42,817
Help me! Please!

1366
01:34:57,925 --> 01:34:59,586
Fred, Fred, help them out.

1367
01:34:59,927 --> 01:35:00,791
That's okay.

1368
01:35:00,928 --> 01:35:02,452
I'm gonna get back across.

1369
01:35:02,563 --> 01:35:04,190
Back across with the Shrine.
Have to get...

1370
01:35:04,331 --> 01:35:05,898
Father, thank you.

1371
01:35:05,933 --> 01:35:08,094
Thank you.
You saved my little girl.

1372
01:35:08,402 --> 01:35:09,528
Thank you so much.

1373
01:35:09,603 --> 01:35:12,663
Don't thank me, thank God.

1374
01:35:16,143 --> 01:35:17,610
She's talking.

1375
01:35:17,712 --> 01:35:19,771
Oh, my God, she's talking.

1376
01:35:25,052 --> 01:35:27,282
My baby's talking.

1377
01:35:27,354 --> 01:35:28,582
He...

1378
01:35:28,656 --> 01:35:31,216
con...

1379
01:35:31,325 --> 01:35:33,054
convict.

1380
01:35:52,146 --> 01:35:55,047
Got to keep my secret,
please, please.

1381
01:35:57,284 --> 01:35:58,308
I cannot.

1382
01:35:58,385 --> 01:36:00,876
Please, do good works
count for nothing?

1383
01:36:07,995 --> 01:36:10,759
Come on, please,
don't betray me.

1384
01:36:20,374 --> 01:36:23,138
He's a convict.

1385
01:36:28,115 --> 01:36:29,275
Is this true?

1386
01:36:29,350 --> 01:36:30,578
Yes.

1387
01:36:30,651 --> 01:36:31,811
You're a convert?

1388
01:36:35,489 --> 01:36:38,720
Yes, yes, we were both born...

1389
01:36:38,793 --> 01:36:41,785
Lutheran.

1390
01:36:44,632 --> 01:36:47,430
God forgives you.

1391
01:36:54,542 --> 01:36:56,533
George. George!

1392
01:37:13,627 --> 01:37:14,889
Quite a show yesterday.

1393
01:37:16,697 --> 01:37:18,494
True bread and circuses.

1394
01:37:18,632 --> 01:37:19,496
You liked that, huh?

1395
01:37:21,936 --> 01:37:25,633
It's a true mis-application
of the teachings of Christ.

1396
01:37:25,773 --> 01:37:27,866
You know, we're all
entitled to that now.

1397
01:37:27,942 --> 01:37:30,240
You keep smiling.

1398
01:37:46,493 --> 01:37:48,222
About time.

1399
01:37:56,203 --> 01:37:57,534
Something funny?

1400
01:37:57,638 --> 01:37:59,333
I'd have been just
as happy staying here.

1401
01:37:59,473 --> 01:38:00,371
Uh-huh.

1402
01:38:01,909 --> 01:38:03,069
Isn't that funny?

1403
01:38:03,143 --> 01:38:04,701
Yeah, it's hysterical.

1404
01:38:04,812 --> 01:38:05,801
Come on. Come on.

1405
01:38:18,559 --> 01:38:21,221
Father Brown!

1406
01:38:21,362 --> 01:38:24,763
We missed you at Matins.

1407
01:38:24,899 --> 01:38:26,958
Yeah, well, I kind of
missed it, too.

1408
01:38:27,034 --> 01:38:28,331
But what are you going to do?

1409
01:38:28,435 --> 01:38:31,802
Are you coming to Lauds?

1410
01:38:31,906 --> 01:38:34,204
Well, I think lauds
have their place,

1411
01:38:34,308 --> 01:38:38,005
but as it is, we got
to get over to Canada.

1412
01:38:38,145 --> 01:38:39,043
You know how it is.

1413
01:38:39,179 --> 01:38:40,669
Father Brown.
Father Brown.

1414
01:38:40,781 --> 01:38:42,806
I'd like to stick around
and enjoy your hospitality

1415
01:38:42,917 --> 01:38:43,906
and so forth.

1416
01:38:43,984 --> 01:38:45,417
Father Brown!

1417
01:38:45,519 --> 01:38:47,419
We all enjoyed your sermon
last night.

1418
01:38:47,554 --> 01:38:52,048
That's good,
I'm glad you did.

1419
01:38:52,159 --> 01:38:55,822
Are you leaving with the others?

1420
01:38:55,963 --> 01:38:57,692
Yes, I think we are.

1421
01:38:57,831 --> 01:39:00,493
Well, we have to.

1422
01:39:00,634 --> 01:39:01,965
Father Brown.

1423
01:39:02,069 --> 01:39:03,730
-Well, we got to go.
-Father Brown.

1424
01:39:20,454 --> 01:39:22,217
Funny, right, I could
have stayed in there.

1425
01:39:22,356 --> 01:39:24,381
Yeah, I told you it was funny.
I told you it was funny.

1426
01:39:24,458 --> 01:39:25,982
Now calm down, okay?
Calm down.

1427
01:39:26,093 --> 01:39:27,219
We get to the border,

1428
01:39:27,294 --> 01:39:28,921
you make the sign of the cross
over the guy,

1429
01:39:29,063 --> 01:39:31,190
I make the sign of the cross
over the guy, over we go.

1430
01:39:31,265 --> 01:39:32,960
-Okay?
-Okay.

1431
01:39:34,702 --> 01:39:35,999
See you in Vespers.

1432
01:39:36,070 --> 01:39:37,196
You bet your life.

1433
01:39:44,078 --> 01:39:46,672
I suppose I should thank you.

1434
01:39:46,780 --> 01:39:48,338
Happy to serve.

1435
01:39:48,449 --> 01:39:50,212
Yeah, I suppose it's a miracle.

1436
01:39:50,351 --> 01:39:51,841
Still asleep?

1437
01:39:51,986 --> 01:39:53,817
Yeah, doc says she should sleep
until noon.

1438
01:39:53,988 --> 01:39:55,421
Thank God.

1439
01:39:55,522 --> 01:39:57,319
What was she shouting
at us yesterday?

1440
01:39:57,458 --> 01:39:59,591
Speaking in tongues.

1441
01:39:59,626 --> 01:40:02,891
You worked a miracle,
is that the truth?

1442
01:40:03,230 --> 01:40:04,527
Hey, believe
what you want to believe.

1443
01:40:04,631 --> 01:40:06,690
What, are you still trying
to pick a fight with me?

1444
01:40:06,767 --> 01:40:07,631
Still?

1445
01:40:07,768 --> 01:40:09,326
No, no, I'm not picking a fight.

1446
01:40:09,436 --> 01:40:12,701
No, matter of fact,
no, I was moved.

1447
01:40:12,773 --> 01:40:14,468
I was moved, I was moved.

1448
01:40:14,608 --> 01:40:16,269
I was thankful what happened.

1449
01:40:16,410 --> 01:40:19,106
What, is that so strange?

1450
01:40:19,246 --> 01:40:20,713
No, no, not strange at all.

1451
01:40:20,814 --> 01:40:22,679
Well, then, what about this?

1452
01:40:22,816 --> 01:40:23,908
I was moved,

1453
01:40:24,018 --> 01:40:28,250
and I'm thinking about
I'll take holy orders.

1454
01:40:41,969 --> 01:40:43,368
Holy orders?

1455
01:40:46,807 --> 01:40:49,139
You sure that's what
you want to do?

1456
01:40:49,243 --> 01:40:51,973
Well, can you think of
a better idea, Father?

1457
01:40:57,251 --> 01:41:00,345
A better idea?

1458
01:41:00,421 --> 01:41:02,651
A better idea?

1459
01:41:51,472 --> 01:41:54,600
Maybe I can.
Maybe I can.

1460
01:41:58,712 --> 01:41:59,940
