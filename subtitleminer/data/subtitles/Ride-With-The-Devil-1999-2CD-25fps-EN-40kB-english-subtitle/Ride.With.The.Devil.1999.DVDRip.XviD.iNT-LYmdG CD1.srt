1
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:56,975
A little late.
Ain't it so?

2
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,053
Mornin'.

3
00:02:07,827 --> 00:02:10,352
Giver of all graces,

4
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:13,296
the author of everlasting light,
send Thy blessing...

5
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:15,834
upon these, Thy servants...

6
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:19,668
this man and this woman
whom we bless in Thy name...

7
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:23,140
that as Isaac and Rebecca
lived faithfully together,

8
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:26,406
so these persons may surely
perform and keep...

9
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:29,448
the vow and covenant
between them made.

10
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:33,746
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here...

11
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:37,347
What's ticklin' you? Do
you smell somethin' funny?

12
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:41,792
Fool. It's the cologne my ma
slapped on me this mornin'.

13
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:44,659
...signifying unto us
the mystical union...

14
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:48,564
What brings you so late
to sister's funeral?

15
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:52,935
I mean wedding.
My pa had me workin'.

16
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,566
Huh.
Son.

17
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:58,611
Let him speak now, or else
forever hold his peace.

18
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:52,258
Do you believe all those men
are necessary, Horton?

19
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:55,892
We can take
no further chances, Asa.

20
00:03:56,002 --> 00:04:00,405
You and I both know it'll soon be war
between us and the Yankee aggressors.

21
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:03,738
With that black republican
Abe Lincoln in the White House,

22
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:08,372
Missouri's no longer safe from the depredations
of Jennison and his Kansas Jayhawkers.

23
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:11,315
They've yet to strike this
deep into Missouri, Horton.

24
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:14,353
Lawrence, Kansas, and its
abolitionists are a long way from here.

25
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,548
There are Union men
even here amongst us, Asa.

26
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:21,060
Schmidt and his Germans formed
a militia at Independence,

27
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:24,494
and his Lawrence cohorts
have eyes and ears amongst us,

28
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:26,622
even here.

29
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:44,146
Good-bye.

30
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:46,151
Take care, now.

31
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:49,848
I've been thinking, Jack Bull,
a wedding is a peculiar thing.

32
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:53,358
It's no more peculiar, Jake,
than slavery. That's certain.

33
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:56,452
That's why I've often wondered
for what cause those Northerners...

34
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:59,464
are so anxious to change
our Southern institutions.

35
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:02,660
When both North and South, men are
every day enslaved at the altar,

36
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:04,794
regardless
of their state or color.

37
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:07,805
When there's a type of subjugation,
we should avoid it, Jake.

38
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:11,435
Happily, my poverty insures
my freedom from such a fate.

39
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:14,776
Oh, no. Not if my mother
can help it.

40
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:19,341
I heard her singin' your praises
earlier to the sister of the groom.

41
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:31,252
Good day, Mrs. Chiles, sir. Father.

42
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:34,458
Please give our regards to your
father, Jake. You know he's invited.

43
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:36,967
He's more comfortable
workin', you know.

44
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:39,869
You must at the least bring
Mr. Roedel some of the cake.

45
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:43,136
I will, ma'am.
Thank you.

46
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:00,657
Guten Morgen.

47
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:03,787
Guten Morgen.
Guten Morgen, Jakob.

48
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:05,921
Guten Morgen.
Guten Morgen.

49
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:14,333
Father, Mrs. Chiles sends her
regards, a piece of the cake.

50
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:19,401
You are to see tomorrow
Mrs. Kreitzer.

51
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:22,573
The war is sure to come now,
with the secession.

52
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:25,446
Mrs. Kreitzer's husband
will take you in St. Louis.

53
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:31,787
Pa, I told you, I'm not gonna huddle
with all the Lincoln-lovin' Germans.

54
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:35,089
It is safer.
For us, this is no war.

55
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:38,187
Pa, you may have bore me in
Germany, but I was raised here.

56
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:40,959
These are my people. And if
it gets hard... Your people?

57
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,627
No, Jakob,
this they are not.

58
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:47,502
You will always be
a deutschman, a German to them,

59
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:51,236
no matter with who
you are friends.

60
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:55,144
Promise me you'll go
to Mrs. Kreitzer.

61
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:49,056
Where is he?
Where is he?

62
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,895
I got him! I got him!

63
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:57,774
No!

64
00:07:57,844 --> 00:07:59,778
Let's go, Asa.

65
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:02,371
My son's gone.

66
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:04,382
Where's your boy?

67
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:08,352
Jake, my pa.

68
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:11,254
He told me to run, Jake.
He told me.

69
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,815
Did you see
who they are?

70
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:17,021
Jayhawkers, Jake.
Lawrence men.

71
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:25,497
Father! Come on! Don't you die here too.

72
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:28,938
Find the boy. Let's go look in the mill.

73
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:34,809
Check the barn.
Find the boy.

74
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:07,870
Ted. Riders.

75
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:23,122
Gentlemen,
Captain Henderson, Company D.

76
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:26,096
You boys have rid
a bit far from home.

77
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:29,623
Hell, spent two night trackin'
this bushwhacking bastard...

78
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:33,603
and his Confederate friends.

79
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:37,006
What are you boys doin'
this far into Missouri?

80
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:39,806
Just rootin' out rebels
and conscriptin' chickens.

81
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:42,780
Been through Cass
and Lafayette Counties.

82
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:45,373
Killed our share.

83
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:51,583
Not much action
in Lafayette.

84
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:54,182
We got four Sunday last.

85
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:58,526
Stretched their necks.
They're still hanging.

86
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,192
Hey, George, fetch
a busthead out there.

87
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:08,204
So you men were in
on Lafayette?

88
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,538
Yes, sir.

89
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:15,104
We were tired of chasin'
these rebs into the bush.

90
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:18,344
Can't trust none of these
locals. They're all hiding 'em.

91
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:21,386
I wish we had
a real army to fight,

92
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,684
not these sneakin' bastards.

93
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:27,123
Battles and armies...
it's all back east.

94
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:30,458
Down here in Missouri, you just
have the people to fight ya.

95
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:32,463
Ted.

96
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:36,134
Ted!

97
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:39,671
So you were in on Lafayette?

98
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:42,503
Bushwhackers!

99
00:10:57,957 --> 00:11:00,221
Whoo!

100
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:07,065
Doin' business with
the Yankee invaders, huh?

101
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:09,067
No. They forced me.

102
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:18,734
He's dead.

103
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:21,779
You killed him.

104
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:25,749
Shoot me too, please.

105
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:28,719
We don't hurt women, ma'am.

106
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:40,823
We took her man.
We should leave her the store.

107
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:47,629
Come on, Jake.
It's gettin' hot in here.

108
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:51,232
Enough of this, boys.
Let's load up!

109
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:57,072
Hyah! Hyah!

110
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:12,657
"Dear Mrs. Chiles,
by this letter you will know...

111
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,667
"that I and your son
Jack Bull are living yet.

112
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:19,933
"We long for news of you, but our
horses'backs remain our only residence,

113
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:22,974
"and it is yet too dangerous
to return home.

114
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:25,840
"Our news is this:
Jack Bull and I at last...

115
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:28,709
"met with Captain Warren,
the killer of your husband,

116
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:31,579
"and he and four of his
accomplices breathe no more.

117
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:36,110
"I know it must be painful to recall the
night your husband was taken from you,

118
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:40,591
"but we hope you will find some comfort
in knowing how our work continues.

119
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:44,925
"Often we don the Union Blue to lull
the Federals into a false serenity,

120
00:12:44,997 --> 00:12:48,433
"and the Yanks pay dearly for
their belief in appearances.

121
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:52,767
"Under the disguise, we wear our
bushwhacker vestments close to our hearts.

122
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:55,170
"They may not be regular
army uniforms,

123
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:58,176
"as there is no Southern army
out here for us to join,

124
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:01,577
but where we find true Missouri
men, we make our own army. "

125
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:05,208
Black John!

126
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:08,014
George Clyde.
Whoa!

127
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:10,681
"If you should happen
upon my father,

128
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:13,122
"kindly express to him
my truest regards.

129
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:17,822
"He will not accept news from me
directly, as he disapproves of our cause.

130
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:20,889
"Please tell him, though,
that in my disobedience to him,

131
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:24,424
"I still obey the call to honor
he himself taught me.

132
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:27,597
"With warmest love
from me and from your son,

133
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:30,106
Yours Sincerely,
Jakob Roedel. "

134
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:34,707
Always loved ridin'
with George Clyde.

135
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:39,649
He makes Yankee killin' as entertainin'
a pastime as greasin' ganders.

136
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:43,586
Whose guns are those?
You mean Holt over there.

137
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:47,422
You'll get used to him.
That's Holt.

138
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,757
That's George Clyde's
pet nigger.

139
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,763
Don't call him that
in front of George, though.

140
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:54,095
George don't like that.
He carries those?

141
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:57,158
Yeah. He's
a damn fine scout.

142
00:13:57,236 --> 00:14:01,229
When George tosses him a
gun, a good Yankee killer too.

143
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,900
Him and Clyde
growed up together.

144
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:07,103
When Jim Wayne's boys come for Clyde,
Holt sent three of them to heaven,

145
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,113
so he rides with us now.

146
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:12,116
'Cause them Yankees
want to kill him real bad.

147
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:15,779
Yeah, well, a nigger with guns
is still a nervous thing to me.

148
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:32,198
We're lookin'
for the Dorr's place, ma'am.

149
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:37,742
It's just up the road.
Who are you?

150
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:42,144
Why, we are Southern men,
and hungry.

151
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:48,915
You don't look like
Southern men. How do I know?

152
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:53,948
Woman, my name is Crawford, one
of the Six Point Creek Crawfords.

153
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:56,358
Do you know me?

154
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:59,158
I knew the father.

155
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:03,399
Well, come on.
Eat as what we have.

156
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:08,797
Whoo.

157
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:26,285
You're an interestin'
foreigner, Jake.

158
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,194
Why is that?

159
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:33,322
I hear your pa's a Dutchman.

160
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:37,495
That you're loyal to here and
not the North. It's uncommon.

161
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,696
No, Jake may have been
born a Dutchman,

162
00:15:39,805 --> 00:15:42,239
but my ma and pa
practically raised him.

163
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:44,868
He's as Southern
as they come.

164
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:20,508
Where's the other one,
you devil?

165
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:23,139
Speak up now,
and maybe you'll live.

166
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:26,844
I'm alone.
That's my daddy's horse.

167
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:29,854
He was shot off it
three days back.

168
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:33,858
He's lyin'. Let's parole
him to Jesus, and right now.

169
00:16:36,428 --> 00:16:39,295
Jake, get in here!
Get the horses!

170
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:49,331
Damn!
They took my pinky!

171
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:52,774
You boys, cover all sides!

172
00:16:57,116 --> 00:17:01,018
Damn! Cover the women!
Go over there!

173
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:08,949
- Ahhh!
- Turner, cover the women!

174
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,622
Please, ma'am,
get over there!

175
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,927
No!

176
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:17,765
Ow! Damn!

177
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:21,306
Don't fret
about that now!

178
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,681
Cease fire!

179
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:34,551
- Cease fire!
- Hold your fire!

180
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,646
I said, cease fire,
goddamn it!

181
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:41,056
Control your fire!

182
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:43,117
Do you kill women?

183
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:46,358
There's women in here!

184
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:49,265
No, we don't kill women!
Send 'em out now...

185
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:51,700
and they'll be safe!

186
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:54,500
Please, ma'am, you and
your daughter got to go.

187
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:59,543
We are goin', son. You best believe
it, there ain't no way we're not goin'.

188
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:31,571
- You'll have to come out!
- Fire!

189
00:18:31,643 --> 00:18:34,703
Riley!

190
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:51,386
- Trust me.
- We can't hold 'em from here!

191
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:54,830
Get back, Lewis!
We'll kill them yet!

192
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,368
We'll just have to take
our chances running!

193
00:18:57,436 --> 00:19:01,736
They'll whittle us down! There ain't
so much as a stump out there for cover!

194
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:06,734
Come on, men!
Let's go do it!

195
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,803
Let's go.

196
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:14,151
Holt.

197
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:23,320
Go! Go!

198
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,813
Go, Riley!

199
00:19:57,629 --> 00:20:00,689
- Come on!
- Let's go!

200
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:05,193
Come on! Get Riley!
Come on!

201
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:15,039
Hold your fire!

202
00:20:15,147 --> 00:20:18,639
- Hold your fire!
- Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

203
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,776
Giddap, boys!
Everyone!

204
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:35,697
Come on.

205
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:38,292
Giddap!

206
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:41,032
Hyah! Hyah!

207
00:20:41,106 --> 00:20:43,438
Let's go!

208
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:10,664
Let's go!

209
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:50,173
Come on!

210
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:56,981
Where's my brother?
Don't know.

211
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:58,983
Did you see my brother?
Uh-uh.

212
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:02,111
- Black John. With him alive.
- With Black John? Alive?

213
00:22:03,555 --> 00:22:07,150
Whoo! That was sure
enough! They left us hurt.

214
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:09,386
This way, boys.

215
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:13,691
Hyah! Come on.

216
00:22:35,053 --> 00:22:36,987
Turner.

217
00:22:57,342 --> 00:23:00,368
Jake? Well, Jack Bull.

218
00:23:00,445 --> 00:23:02,743
Jake Roedel.

219
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:11,086
Well, Alf Bowden,
you sure are in a fix.

220
00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:13,886
Seems so.
Surely does seem so.

221
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:16,257
Do you know this man?
Certainly.

222
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:19,593
His daddy's place is just
downriver from the Chiles'.

223
00:23:19,664 --> 00:23:21,632
Hemp growers.

224
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,968
Jack Bull.

225
00:23:26,037 --> 00:23:29,006
Goes it at home?

226
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:31,406
No, no, no.
It all just goes on.

227
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:34,070
Some may have died,
not most.

228
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:36,444
What of my mother?

229
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:40,279
Well, now...
Well, she is watched.

230
00:23:40,352 --> 00:23:42,513
All the secess
are watched.

231
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:45,078
And my father?

232
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:47,454
He comes and goes.
He's a Union man.

233
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:50,723
He ain't bothered by no one.
You must know that.

234
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:55,028
You must know the whole town talks about
you boys out here black-flaggin' it.

235
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,661
Some friendliness
may be lost for your kin.

236
00:23:58,737 --> 00:24:02,867
Come on, now.
You been fed?

237
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:06,707
Not so as you notice.

238
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:09,406
I'll look into it.

239
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,875
Roedel.

240
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:19,047
Now, take this down. This
is for the Lexington Union News.

241
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:21,888
So do it fine
the way you do.

242
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,827
Gladly.

243
00:24:24,896 --> 00:24:26,955
"Dear Citizens,

244
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:30,866
"The stakes are most common
these days in deadly foray.

245
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:35,498
"The Federals are to hang
William Lloyd and James Curtain,

246
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:37,633
"two fine sons of Missouri.

247
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:39,836
"But by a provident
cut of the cards,

248
00:24:39,911 --> 00:24:42,539
"four Federals
have been dealt to me,

249
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:45,980
"and it is their hope that Lloyd
and Curtain are not hanged,

250
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:50,283
"as they would provide
the sequel to these murders.

251
00:24:50,355 --> 00:24:54,314
"However,
if our boys are released,

252
00:24:54,392 --> 00:24:56,883
"I will, as a gentlemen,

253
00:24:56,962 --> 00:25:00,159
"release these unfortunates.

254
00:25:00,232 --> 00:25:04,999
"The choice is yours, citizens,
so make it wisely.

255
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:08,096
"Signed, John Ambrose
and George Clyde,

256
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,869
Commander and First,
Irregulars. "

257
00:25:10,942 --> 00:25:14,036
That's good.
Put a note on it that says,

258
00:25:14,112 --> 00:25:18,071
"What you think we ain't,
we are. Remember it. "

259
00:25:22,587 --> 00:25:26,523
Who will deliver it? There are
Federals all over Lexington.

260
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:30,857
We could slip a man in
there. We done it before.

261
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:35,366
Oh, I reckon a citizen could be pressed
into service, if one could be found.

262
00:25:35,433 --> 00:25:39,870
That might be a job, for
citizens are cautious hereabouts.

263
00:25:39,938 --> 00:25:42,065
You got some
better idea, Dutchie?

264
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:44,472
Maybe you should
volunteer yourself.

265
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:48,673
Well, there is a way we could
prove more things than one.

266
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:51,840
If we send a prisoner, it would
prove we have prisoners,

267
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:55,215
and also, he can attest
to our intentions.

268
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:58,654
It seems to me he could get
more quickly into town as well.

269
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:04,286
And time is short. Lloyd and Curtain
will be hanged right quick, I would think.

270
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:14,403
It's a good idea.
Some fine touches to it.

271
00:26:14,472 --> 00:26:16,599
Yeah, you should
speak up more, Roedel.

272
00:26:16,675 --> 00:26:19,337
You're not near so dumb
as you let on.

273
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:21,345
Awww.

274
00:26:21,446 --> 00:26:26,247
Now, go put one of them Federals
on a horse with that letter.

275
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:29,446
Convince them to see
this deal through, Alf.

276
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:33,048
We're only askin' to be treated
like the soldiers that we are.

277
00:26:33,124 --> 00:26:35,615
We shall do the same
for your companions here.

278
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:38,185
Do your best.

279
00:26:44,035 --> 00:26:45,969
Huh.

280
00:26:49,507 --> 00:26:52,169
What are you lookin' at?

281
00:27:09,494 --> 00:27:11,655
Jake.
Aw.

282
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:14,858
Black John says you're
lettered. It's Union mail.

283
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:18,630
He wants you to look it over, tell
him if there's anything to learn.

284
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:20,671
All right.

285
00:27:25,343 --> 00:27:27,470
Well, it's just stuff
from up north.

286
00:27:27,545 --> 00:27:30,776
There's no military
intelligence in here.

287
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:34,512
Well, maybe you could read it
to us just the same.

288
00:27:36,888 --> 00:27:39,652
Read us this letter,
Dutchie.

289
00:27:39,724 --> 00:27:42,522
That's someone else's letter.

290
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:46,360
Was. I wanna
hear you read it.

291
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:49,559
I don't think I care to.

292
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:54,367
Oh, is that so? Well, I think that if
you think a little bit more, Dutchie,

293
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:56,964
you'll think you do
wanna read at me.

294
00:27:57,075 --> 00:27:58,906
Right now, too.

295
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:08,217
How do we know there might be
secrets in it? Read it at us.

296
00:28:08,286 --> 00:28:12,052
Yeah, come on, Dutchie.

297
00:28:12,123 --> 00:28:14,387
All right.

298
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:19,158
This here is from Mrs. Mary
Williams of Bear Lake, Wisconsin.

299
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:25,702
"Dear Sons,
No word of you in so long,

300
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:28,830
"right past first frost
of the year last.

301
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:31,568
"Your father is better, but
his feet are still bloatin'.

302
00:28:31,643 --> 00:28:33,577
He won't walk right
on them. "

303
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:36,273
That's the blood does that.
The blood bloats the feet.

304
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:39,946
"Fire hit the old church.
Burned down.

305
00:28:40,018 --> 00:28:43,579
"The new one was just ready, so
no great trouble was had of it.

306
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:47,284
"Margaret is married since
the frost of this year last.

307
00:28:47,358 --> 00:28:50,691
"You wouldn't know it, for how could
you? Her husband is Walter Maddox.

308
00:28:50,762 --> 00:28:54,528
"He is out of the war, with
one arm busted at New Madrid.

309
00:28:54,632 --> 00:28:57,123
"But it works fine enough.

310
00:28:57,235 --> 00:29:01,331
"The dirt was turned over, and the
smell and deepness gave me heart.

311
00:29:03,508 --> 00:29:07,205
It is just black rich.
You boys know how that is. "

312
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:09,769
My daddy was up there.

313
00:29:09,848 --> 00:29:12,715
He was up there
way before they hung him.

314
00:29:12,784 --> 00:29:16,049
He said the dirt was so rich
you could've et it like porridge.

315
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:20,888
Yeah, very good dirt up there.
Short grow season.

316
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:23,723
Yeah, sounds like
real good dirt to me.

317
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:30,331
"That girl Dave got sweet for is
in town and still single and about.

318
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:34,895
"She asks of you, but I have no news
since first frost of the year last.

319
00:29:35,006 --> 00:29:37,998
"Without news,
I cannot answer her.

320
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:43,169
You are both missed here.
Your mother. "

321
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:47,309
Sounds like my mother.
What a woman does.

322
00:29:47,385 --> 00:29:51,913
One mother's
very much like another.

323
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:55,756
Remember one thing: Her boys
will kill you if they can.

324
00:30:17,248 --> 00:30:19,341
What is it, Jake?

325
00:30:21,085 --> 00:30:23,815
I hear you ruminatin'louder
than a cow chewin'in my ear,

326
00:30:23,888 --> 00:30:26,550
and it's keepin' me
from my sleep.

327
00:30:26,624 --> 00:30:31,561
Do you think Alf Bowden's made
it back to Lexington as yet?

328
00:30:31,629 --> 00:30:36,089
There was a minute there
when I saw him ridin' off,

329
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:39,534
and I thought maybe
you and me could join him.

330
00:30:39,604 --> 00:30:42,767
That we could all
ride home together.

331
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:45,469
Just ride back home.

332
00:30:45,543 --> 00:30:50,879
What have you left at home
you're so anxious to ride back to?

333
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:56,886
Nothin'.
Just a passel of memories.

334
00:30:56,955 --> 00:31:00,152
Mostly memories
of you and me.

335
00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:03,661
Of your father,
old Asa Chiles.

336
00:31:07,765 --> 00:31:11,633
We'll stick together, Jack Bull.
We'll get all of it back.

337
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:16,640
You're a black magician
who can raise the dead, are ya?

338
00:31:19,444 --> 00:31:23,972
No, my father's
under the dirt to stay.

339
00:31:24,015 --> 00:31:27,109
Like that's
goin' to stay too.

340
00:31:27,185 --> 00:31:30,621
My finger?
Mm-hmm.

341
00:31:30,688 --> 00:31:32,849
Well, so it is.

342
00:31:32,924 --> 00:31:35,859
And it makes me notable
by the loss.

343
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:41,024
You sound pleased, as if that finger
had been pesterin' you for rings.

344
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:44,660
No, it was a fine finger,
and I'd rather have it still.

345
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:49,604
But it was took from me, and
it's been et by chickens for sure.

346
00:31:51,342 --> 00:31:55,278
And I say, "What is the
good side to this amputation?

347
00:31:55,346 --> 00:31:58,406
And there is one.
Name it, Jake.

348
00:31:58,483 --> 00:32:01,611
Well, say one day
some Federals...

349
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:04,746
catch up to me and
kill me in a thicket.

350
00:32:04,822 --> 00:32:06,983
They would riddle me
and hang me,

351
00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:09,652
and no Southern man
would find me for months.

352
00:32:09,727 --> 00:32:13,823
When they did, I'd be bad meat,
pretty well rotted to a glob.

353
00:32:13,898 --> 00:32:18,460
You're scientifically accurate,
I'm afraid. I've seen it.

354
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:22,005
I'd be a mysterious
gob of rot.

355
00:32:22,073 --> 00:32:25,406
People would say,
"Who was that?"

356
00:32:25,476 --> 00:32:28,343
And surely someone
would look up and say,

357
00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:31,610
"Why, it's nubbin-fingered
Jake Roedel. "

358
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:35,483
And then you could go and tell
my father I was clearly murdered,

359
00:32:35,553 --> 00:32:38,488
and he wouldn't be tortured
by uncertain wonders.

360
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:42,556
And that's the good of it?

361
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,891
Yes, sir,
that's the good.

362
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:47,989
Go to sleep, Jake Roedel.

363
00:33:04,015 --> 00:33:06,848
It is time for our winter
hibernation.

364
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:10,945
I have gathered the names of loyal
Southerners who shall provide for us.

365
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:13,115
We'll group in fours.

366
00:33:13,191 --> 00:33:17,685
I'll send word the beginnin' of
spring for where to rendezvous.

367
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:20,697
We shall
to the Evans farm, boys.

368
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:24,428
Their place is about half
a mile from the Willards',

369
00:33:24,535 --> 00:33:27,436
where there resides
a certain Miss Juanita,

370
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:29,803
to whom, if I
do not flatter myself,

371
00:33:29,874 --> 00:33:32,536
my attentions are not
unfavorably regarded.

372
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:34,908
You mean to say we're to spend
the winter in Lafayette...

373
00:33:34,979 --> 00:33:37,743
solely on account that you're
sweet on Juanita Willard?

374
00:33:37,815 --> 00:33:40,579
That's as good a reason
as any, Dutchie.

375
00:33:44,922 --> 00:33:47,584
Nolan's brought
some news from home.

376
00:33:47,658 --> 00:33:49,649
Hank Patterson is murdered.

377
00:33:49,727 --> 00:33:53,128
Our old neighbor Jansen got him
with his gang of militia.

378
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:56,360
That's sad. He was a good
Southern man. What of Thomas?

379
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:58,492
Oh, he is murdered too.

380
00:33:58,603 --> 00:34:01,401
And Sally Burgess
married a Federal from Michigan.

381
00:34:01,472 --> 00:34:05,772
Her whole family
hides their faces.

382
00:34:08,012 --> 00:34:10,412
And...

383
00:34:12,116 --> 00:34:14,846
well, Dutchie,

384
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:17,410
that Federal,
Alf Bowden,

385
00:34:17,488 --> 00:34:20,719
he rode straight from here
and killed your father.

386
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:27,461
He shot him in the neck
down by the river,

387
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:31,195
then booted him
along Main Street till he died.

388
00:34:33,971 --> 00:34:36,462
I spared Alf Bowden.

389
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:40,343
You all know it.

390
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:45,314
You taught him nicely,
but he forgot the lesson.

391
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:52,416
But my father... My father was
a Unionist like all the Germans.

392
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:55,015
An unconditional Unionist.

393
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:59,587
Well, yeah, but he was mainly
known as your father, Dutchie.

394
00:34:59,664 --> 00:35:02,792
You got a reputation now.

395
00:36:00,691 --> 00:36:02,955
Come here, boys.

396
00:36:03,027 --> 00:36:04,961
Good day, sir.

397
00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:08,055
Abel Evans.
George Clyde.

398
00:36:08,132 --> 00:36:13,627
Sorry we can't all be of proper
hospitality, but with the Federal patrols...

399
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:17,572
We're much obliged.
May I ask after Mrs. Evans?

400
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:21,772
My wife. Well, she's as well
as can be expected.

401
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:25,077
Our other Mrs. Evans,
Sue Lee...

402
00:36:25,149 --> 00:36:28,915
Well, she was a Mrs. Evans
for but three weeks...

403
00:36:28,986 --> 00:36:32,649
until my son joined
our Confederate forces.

404
00:36:34,225 --> 00:36:37,752
He was killed in the
fightin' at Independence.

405
00:36:41,732 --> 00:36:44,530
We're sorry
to hear of it.

406
00:36:44,635 --> 00:36:47,627
Yes, well,
you boys lay low.

407
00:36:47,738 --> 00:36:50,639
We'll come by from time
to time with provisions...

408
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:52,938
such as there are.

409
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:55,308
We're much obliged.

410
00:37:18,102 --> 00:37:21,765
Been a while since we done work.
Somethin' soothin' to it.

411
00:37:23,608 --> 00:37:27,305
Yeah, well, work has never
been my main ambition.

412
00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:30,939
We've done much work. I think
I've spied an easier way to riches.

413
00:37:31,015 --> 00:37:34,451
Spell out this miracle.

414
00:37:34,518 --> 00:37:36,952
You just ride on up
and take it.

415
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:40,650
Ah, good old rule.
Simple plan.

416
00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:44,320
It's a workable method
that is proven.

417
00:37:47,732 --> 00:37:51,293
George, you got
mud in your eye.

418
00:37:51,402 --> 00:37:54,701
Rider's comin'.

419
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:57,104
Let's go see our visitor.

420
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:07,740
Good day. Don't shoot
or some dumb thing like that.

421
00:38:18,863 --> 00:38:22,299
Whoa. Well, how do?
You must be Mrs. Evans.

422
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,994
I brung you some supper.

423
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:31,233
I'm, uh, pleased to
meet you, Mr... Chiles.

424
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:35,575
Mr. Jack Bull Chiles.
This is Jake Roedel.

425
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:38,547
And...
George Clyde, Mrs. Evans.

426
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:43,280
Mr. Evans wishes me to apologize
for not havin' sent you food sooner.

427
00:38:43,354 --> 00:38:46,482
The Federals
have been on the move.

428
00:38:46,557 --> 00:38:50,960
Don't you call me Mrs. Evans.
My name is Sue Lee Shelley.

429
00:38:51,028 --> 00:38:53,690
It's a good one,
and I am a widow now.

430
00:38:53,764 --> 00:38:56,289
Reckon I'll go back to it
and use it.

431
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:00,029
Please pardon me.

432
00:39:00,137 --> 00:39:03,732
Won't you come in?
It's not much to gaze upon,

433
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:06,503
but I reckon we could assay
some hospitality.

434
00:39:06,577 --> 00:39:09,102
George.
After me, ma'am.

435
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:21,454
Right this way, ma'am.
Excuse me.

436
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:23,652
Thank you.

437
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,555
Damn.

438
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:33,469
What are you smilin' at?

439
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:36,938
I'll see to that mule.

440
00:39:37,007 --> 00:39:40,135
Wait a second.
What did you say?

441
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:43,203
I say I'll look to him.

442
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:47,808
You better go on in there,
let that woman see your face.

443
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:53,451
Damnation, Holt. I think I know best
how to handle my personal affairs.

444
00:39:53,524 --> 00:39:57,756
Now, you see that lady's mule while
I check on what she brung to eat.

445
00:40:00,631 --> 00:40:03,167
Excuse the mud. We'll just...

446
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,564
There you are, ma'am.

447
00:40:13,878 --> 00:40:18,281
My! Aren't you
bushwhackers the gentlemen.

448
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:21,284
We try to make the effort
when possible, ma'am.

449
00:40:21,385 --> 00:40:24,411
Do you think manners should
be dropped in times like these?

450
00:40:24,522 --> 00:40:28,515
No. But I don't think horse
sense oughta be dropped either.

451
00:40:28,626 --> 00:40:31,925
It's cold.

452
00:40:34,732 --> 00:40:37,667
You're so kind
to think of us, ma'am.

453
00:40:37,735 --> 00:40:41,136
You men think of us more.
You do the good work.

454
00:40:41,205 --> 00:40:43,901
I know it's dirty
and it's dangerous.

455
00:40:43,974 --> 00:40:46,636
Those are good words
to hear, ma'am.

456
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:49,474
It's not always
we hear them.

457
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:58,745
Well, I really
should be goin'.

458
00:40:58,856 --> 00:41:02,587
Mrs. Evans will worry
if I don't.

459
00:41:03,727 --> 00:41:06,355
Uh, ma'am?

460
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:10,298
We're awful sorry about
Evans, Jr. gettin' killed.

461
00:41:11,735 --> 00:41:15,501
Well, we all suffer,
but he suffers no more.

462
00:41:15,573 --> 00:41:18,906
He was a good husband to me.

463
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:23,208
For three weeks he was a good
husband, but he didn't last.

464
00:41:28,953 --> 00:41:31,387
What's he doin' here,
inside?

465
00:41:31,455 --> 00:41:34,822
Oh, ma'am, this nigger's
with me. His name is Holt.

466
00:41:34,892 --> 00:41:40,023
Well, wouldn't he be more useful
off in a field, plowin'?

467
00:41:40,097 --> 00:41:44,466
Oh, no, I reckon not.

468
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:48,471
No, ma'am. That's one nigger I
wouldn't try to hitch behind a plow.

469
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:50,871
No, I wouldn't try that.

470
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:55,577
Well, now.

471
00:41:57,748 --> 00:41:59,716
Oh, I almost forgot.

472
00:41:59,783 --> 00:42:03,048
Mr. Evans asked that you come to the
house tomorrow evenin' after dark.

473
00:42:03,153 --> 00:42:06,418
He's up on latest Federal movements,
and he could post you on 'em.

474
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:08,958
Why, we'd be honored.

475
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:12,722
Um, I'm not sure about him.
Mr. Evans...

476
00:42:12,796 --> 00:42:16,926
You ain't got nothin' to worry about on
that score. You needn't worry about Holt.

477
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:19,993
I'll be takin'Holt with me
to the Willards'tomorrow.

478
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:22,834
We won't be comin'
to your dinner.

479
00:42:22,907 --> 00:42:25,933
Mr. Clyde, honestly, I didn't
mean to speak ill of your nigger.

480
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:27,944
He's not my nigger.

481
00:42:28,012 --> 00:42:32,210
He's just a nigger who I trust with my
life every day and night, that's all.

482
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:37,418
- That's very high praise.
- Yes, ma'am, it is.

483
00:42:37,488 --> 00:42:39,752
I see.

484
00:42:39,823 --> 00:42:43,088
Well, gentlemen,
I really must take my leave.

485
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:46,561
I hope the food'll please
you. It looks wonderful.

486
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:49,394
Why, thank you.
Now, good night, all.

487
00:42:49,466 --> 00:42:52,128
- Good night.
- Good night, ma'am.

488
00:42:52,202 --> 00:42:55,194
Holt, the lady said
good night to all.

489
00:42:55,272 --> 00:42:57,297
Touch your hat
and say good night.

490
00:42:57,374 --> 00:42:59,433
- You don't tell him nothin'.
- He's bein' rude.

491
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:01,944
- Gentlemen, please.
- He don't need no tellin'.

492
00:43:02,012 --> 00:43:06,449
George.
Good night, missy.

493
00:43:08,285 --> 00:43:10,344
Good night, Holt.

494
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:18,023
I'll see the lady
to her mule.

495
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:24,962
Holt. It won't be a hardship, George.

496
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:29,164
Well, let's eat.
This smells good.

497
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:31,400
Be careful.

498
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:02,036
Holt, you want my bacon?

499
00:44:07,711 --> 00:44:09,645
I could eat more.

500
00:44:09,713 --> 00:44:11,704
Go on, then.

501
00:44:16,186 --> 00:44:18,814
I appreciate it.

502
00:44:21,191 --> 00:44:23,853
Roedel...

503
00:44:23,927 --> 00:44:26,896
do you want my bacon?

504
00:44:30,034 --> 00:44:32,059
Yes, I could eat it.

505
00:44:32,136 --> 00:44:35,196
Well, I'll shit it out by
the oak tree in the mornin'.

506
00:44:35,272 --> 00:44:37,832
You can just go
and help yourself.

507
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:53,281
And why, if you do not mind my askin',
did you not join the regular army?

508
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:56,655
Army? Well,
we thought of it.

509
00:44:56,727 --> 00:45:00,595
I suppose we decided this fight's
got to be made in our own country,

510
00:45:00,664 --> 00:45:03,724
not where some general
tells us it should happen.

511
00:45:03,801 --> 00:45:06,065
It soon will be everywhere.

512
00:45:06,136 --> 00:45:10,095
My family and I, we will be
quittin' this house in the spring.

513
00:45:10,174 --> 00:45:14,543
As soon as the roads are clear,
we're gonna be tryin' for Texas.

514
00:45:14,611 --> 00:45:17,774
About half of Missouri's
went to Texas.

515
00:45:17,848 --> 00:45:20,681
Now, the whole state's
thick with invaders.

516
00:45:20,784 --> 00:45:23,719
We cannot
drive them away.

517
00:45:23,787 --> 00:45:27,553
We have different thoughts.
I still want to fight.

518
00:45:27,624 --> 00:45:31,390
I reckon I'll always
want to fight them.

519
00:45:33,163 --> 00:45:35,188
Always.

520
00:45:40,804 --> 00:45:43,432
Have you ever been
to Lawrence, Kansas, young man?

521
00:45:43,507 --> 00:45:46,499
No, I reckon not, Mr. Evans.

522
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:49,478
I don't believe I'd be
too welcome in Lawrence.

523
00:45:49,546 --> 00:45:52,515
I didn't think so.
Before this war began,

524
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:55,780
my business
took me there often.

525
00:45:55,886 --> 00:45:58,446
As I saw those Northerners
build that town,

526
00:45:58,555 --> 00:46:01,388
I witnessed the seeds
of our destruction being sown.

527
00:46:01,458 --> 00:46:04,655
The foundin' of that town was truly
the beginnin' of the Yankee invasion.

528
00:46:04,728 --> 00:46:07,162
I'm not speakin' of numbers,

529
00:46:07,231 --> 00:46:10,428
nor even abolitionist
trouble-makin'.

530
00:46:10,501 --> 00:46:13,470
It was the schoolhouse.

531
00:46:13,537 --> 00:46:17,439
Before they built their church,
even, they built that schoolhouse.

532
00:46:17,508 --> 00:46:19,601
And they let in
every tailor's son...

533
00:46:19,676 --> 00:46:23,009
and every farmer's daughter
in that country.

534
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:26,880
Spellin' won't help you
hold a plow any firmer.

535
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:29,077
Or a gun either.

536
00:46:29,186 --> 00:46:32,883
No, it won't, Mr. Chiles.
But my point is merely...

537
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:36,448
that they rounded every pup
up into that schoolhouse...

538
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,495
because they fancied
that everyone should think...

539
00:46:39,563 --> 00:46:42,657
and talk the same
free-thinkin' way they do...

540
00:46:42,733 --> 00:46:45,827
with no regard
to station, custom,

541
00:46:45,903 --> 00:46:48,133
propriety.

542
00:46:48,205 --> 00:46:50,799
And that is why they will win.

543
00:46:50,874 --> 00:46:55,311
Because they believe everyone
should live and think Just like them.

544
00:46:56,780 --> 00:47:00,045
And we shall lose because we
don't care one way or another...

545
00:47:00,117 --> 00:47:02,210
how they live.

546
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:05,413
We just worry about ourselves.

547
00:47:06,757 --> 00:47:10,488
Are you sayin', sir,
that we fight for nothin'?

548
00:47:11,929 --> 00:47:14,261
Far from it, Mr. Chiles.

549
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:17,164
You fight for everything
that we ever had.

550
00:47:17,234 --> 00:47:19,600
As did my son.

551
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:23,834
It's just that
we don't have it anymore.

552
00:47:25,275 --> 00:47:28,108
Mr. Evans, when you
get back from Texas,

553
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:30,373
it'll all be here
waitin' for you.

554
00:47:30,447 --> 00:47:33,314
Jack Bull and me,
we'll see to it.

555
00:47:33,383 --> 00:47:37,183
Well... yes.

556
00:47:37,287 --> 00:47:42,054
Thank you, son.
Well, enough of this war talk.

557
00:47:42,125 --> 00:47:46,152
Let's have the ladies join us
and think nobler thoughts.

558
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:48,164
Lydia!
Fine idea.

559
00:47:48,232 --> 00:47:50,291
Some company
would be splendid.

560
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:52,528
We should be thinkin'
about gettin'back.

561
00:47:52,603 --> 00:47:54,764
The Federals
could pass by anytime.

562
00:47:54,838 --> 00:47:57,705
Sue Lee! Oh, put a gown
on, Jake. It's too cold.

563
00:47:57,774 --> 00:48:01,335
They'll all be in front of the
fire examinin' their plunder.

564
00:48:01,411 --> 00:48:06,110
I, uh, have it in me to sing
Shall we have a sing-along?

565
00:48:06,183 --> 00:48:09,118
Oh, yes.
I like those the best.

566
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:11,687
My voice is not
what it should be,

567
00:48:11,788 --> 00:48:14,348
but it was once rumored
that I could carry a tune.

568
00:48:14,458 --> 00:48:18,554
- And you, Mr. Roedel?
- I believe I won't sing. Young ears are present.

569
00:48:18,629 --> 00:48:22,429
- I bet you sing lovely.
- You would lose that bet.

570
00:48:22,499 --> 00:48:26,162
He really does sing very poorly, but
he imitates the turkey first-rate.

571
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:30,104
- I best do my gobblin'
out of doors.

572
00:48:30,173 --> 00:48:33,165
You go ahead and sing along.
I'll keep my eye on the road.

573
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:36,041
- Do you really think that...
- Good man, Jake. I'll relieve you soon.

574
00:49:45,182 --> 00:49:47,480
Clyde back?

575
00:49:47,551 --> 00:49:52,488
I believe he's fixin' to pass a
few more hours with Miss Juanita.

576
00:49:52,556 --> 00:49:54,683
Jack Bull?

577
00:49:54,791 --> 00:49:57,954
He's covered
in Miss Sue Lee Evans.

578
00:49:58,028 --> 00:50:00,588
You mean Sue Lee Shelley.

579
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:06,931
Roedel?
Yeah, Holt?

580
00:50:10,607 --> 00:50:12,939
What's that?

581
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:17,640
I've been keeping 'em.
Nobody ever learned me letters.

582
00:50:17,714 --> 00:50:20,478
When you were readin'
the mails out loud,

583
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:23,678
it was somethin' the likes
of which I'd never heard.

584
00:50:23,787 --> 00:50:26,779
Got me thinkin' you might
sometime try it again.

585
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:30,121
So you packed those
and kept 'em all this time?

586
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:33,356
It might not be
too amusin'.

587
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:37,298
It might just be a bunch of borin'
thoughts from one stranger to another.

588
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:40,427
That one you read from the
mother was fine. You recall it?

589
00:50:40,504 --> 00:50:43,200
Yeah.

590
00:50:43,273 --> 00:50:45,503
She said things
I enjoyed to hear.

591
00:50:45,575 --> 00:50:49,011
All right, here goes.

592
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:52,048
"Dear Brother, I must
write this right quick...

593
00:50:52,115 --> 00:50:56,677
"'cause I say good-bye to
Massachusetts and our home in one hour.

594
00:50:56,787 --> 00:50:58,982
"Yes, Danny,
I've joined the fight,

595
00:50:59,089 --> 00:51:02,115
"and a difficulter decision
never before was made,

596
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:07,527
"as I've been just about the only eligible
bachelor to dance with at Parlans' this year.

597
00:51:07,597 --> 00:51:11,089
"Without my favorite brother,
it is not the same,

598
00:51:11,168 --> 00:51:13,796
"although the beer
has been free,

599
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:17,237
"as I've been drinkin' it with
one of the Parlans' daughters.

600
00:51:17,307 --> 00:51:19,935
"Which one, I will not tell.

601
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:23,537
Here's to you, Danny, and keep
your head low out there. Bill. "

602
00:51:27,384 --> 00:51:31,047
It could come to where
you could maybe like that man.

603
00:51:31,154 --> 00:51:34,749
Yeah, in other times
he would not be so bad.

604
00:51:37,861 --> 00:51:41,092
I think, though, I like
the one from the mama best.

605
00:51:47,237 --> 00:51:51,003
Holt, where is your mother?

606
00:51:51,074 --> 00:51:53,668
Ahh...

607
00:51:53,743 --> 00:51:57,440
Kansas or Kingdom.
I don't know.

608
00:51:59,049 --> 00:52:03,850
I know she was sold into Texas.

609
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:08,189
I reckon she in Texas.

610
00:52:09,693 --> 00:52:13,288
How was that?
Was that George that sold her?

611
00:52:13,363 --> 00:52:16,457
No, sir. George and me,
we growed up neighbors.

612
00:52:16,533 --> 00:52:19,798
It was George what bought me
out when Master Henry passed,

613
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:23,772
but he didn't have no means
for my mama or my sister.

614
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:28,877
- So Clyde owns you?
- No, sir.

615
00:52:28,945 --> 00:52:32,108
Not in greenbacks
and coppers, no how.

616
00:52:32,182 --> 00:52:34,343
No, he don't own me
that way.

617
00:52:34,451 --> 00:52:37,852
Nope.

618
00:52:37,921 --> 00:52:41,186
He made it out a gift.

619
00:52:59,209 --> 00:53:02,201
It's me.

620
00:53:02,279 --> 00:53:04,372
Hey, Jake.

621
00:53:04,447 --> 00:53:06,711
Hey, Miss Wild,
you splattered poor Holt.

622
00:53:06,783 --> 00:53:08,842
Well, it surely is.

623
00:53:08,919 --> 00:53:11,854
Oh, no. Mm-mm.

624
00:53:13,924 --> 00:53:17,860
Whoa, mule, settle down
there! Mule? A mule?

625
00:53:17,961 --> 00:53:20,395
Just calm down.

626
00:53:20,463 --> 00:53:23,830
Well, do I look
muley to you?

627
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:26,698
Why, no.

628
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:29,330
Well, does that look
like a mule to you?

629
00:53:29,406 --> 00:53:33,934
Does that look like the rear end of
an animal that hee-haws in the night?

630
00:53:34,010 --> 00:53:36,274
It looks like
it might could be.

631
00:53:36,346 --> 00:53:39,042
Jack Bull Chiles!
Just 'cause I'm a widow...

632
00:53:39,115 --> 00:53:41,743
don't mean that you can get
that familiar with me.

633
00:53:41,818 --> 00:53:45,276
Pardon me, ma'am, but I believe it was
you that shoved your rump into my face.

634
00:53:45,355 --> 00:53:47,653
That was only
just to make a point.

635
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:51,421
You made it. I'll always know
your rump from a mule's now.

636
00:53:51,494 --> 00:53:54,725
Several differences. Don't
know how I missed 'em before.

637
00:53:57,767 --> 00:54:00,998
Well, don't be mean.

638
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:03,471
I can't tolerate
meanness.

639
00:54:17,487 --> 00:54:19,421
Is that too mean?

640
00:54:19,489 --> 00:54:22,549
No. It's really
not too mean at all.

641
00:54:26,162 --> 00:54:28,926
Oh, for cryin' out loud!
We're sittin' right here.

642
00:54:28,999 --> 00:54:31,126
Show us some mercy.

643
00:54:34,337 --> 00:54:37,397
He really is quite right.

644
00:54:37,474 --> 00:54:40,034
I better get back
to the house.

645
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:42,476
Cover your tracks
in the snow too.

646
00:54:42,545 --> 00:54:45,844
You'll be leadin' curious
Federals right onto us.

647
00:54:45,915 --> 00:54:48,782
Don't be rude.
There's no reason to be rude.

648
00:54:48,852 --> 00:54:51,946
There happens to be
a war goin'on...

649
00:54:52,055 --> 00:54:54,387
everywhere but between
your two ears, you dumb ox.

650
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:57,915
Dumb ox, am I?

651
00:55:02,732 --> 00:55:05,098
Sorry, Jake. My leg
Just did that on its own.

652
00:55:05,168 --> 00:55:07,227
No thought behind it.

653
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:10,239
I hear you. I hear you.

654
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:13,242
But Holt and me ain't dyin'
Just so you could be kissed.

655
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:17,303
Leave Holt out of this. Holt ain't
even here. Holt ain't nowhere near here.

656
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:20,372
I don't think anybody's
about to die from my kiss.

657
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:23,214
In fact, she seems
to be doin' tolerably well.

658
00:55:23,286 --> 00:55:25,652
Well enough
to get goin' too.

659
00:55:25,755 --> 00:55:28,280
Good day.

660
00:55:42,706 --> 00:55:46,198
You reckon George Clyde'll ever
Join up with us again,

661
00:55:46,276 --> 00:55:50,838
or do you think Juanita Willard will be
his only cause and comfort from here on?

662
00:55:50,914 --> 00:55:54,145
Ah, George is efficient
when it comes to comfort.

663
00:55:55,385 --> 00:55:58,479
This thing with Sue Lee and you,
will it go on?

664
00:55:58,588 --> 00:56:02,684
I reckon.
Well, that's good for you.

665
00:56:02,792 --> 00:56:06,125
Yeah, I believe
I'll marry her.

666
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:08,858
I believe you should.

667
00:56:25,815 --> 00:56:28,283
Sue Lee'll be by
this evening.

668
00:56:28,351 --> 00:56:31,218
Oh, good. It's been near
a week since I've seen her.

669
00:56:31,321 --> 00:56:34,779
Yeah, all this warmth has
the Federals out for jaunts.

670
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:38,349
It's kept her home. It won't be
long before we join 'em out there.

671
00:56:38,461 --> 00:56:42,056
No, it won't. That's why I want
to ask somethin' of you and Holt.

672
00:56:42,132 --> 00:56:44,066
Name it.

673
00:56:44,134 --> 00:56:47,934
Well, future best man, I'd like
to ask you for some privacy.

674
00:56:49,339 --> 00:56:51,739
Oh, you would, would you?

675
00:56:51,808 --> 00:56:54,174
It's not much to ask.

676
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:56,542
And what are Holt
and me to do?

677
00:56:56,613 --> 00:57:00,049
Anything you'd like. Throw walnuts
at squirrels. Play mumblety-peg.

678
00:57:00,116 --> 00:57:04,052
I reckon we could come up with a better
use of our time than that, eh, Holt?

679
00:57:04,154 --> 00:57:06,622
It's possible.

680
00:57:25,975 --> 00:57:27,909
Howdy.

681
00:57:31,481 --> 00:57:35,247
Ahem, brung you two
somethin'.

682
00:57:35,318 --> 00:57:38,014
Try this bread, boys.

683
00:57:39,322 --> 00:57:41,449
Why, thank you.
Did you make it?

684
00:57:41,558 --> 00:57:45,085
No. Miss Evans' sister
lives in town.

685
00:57:45,195 --> 00:57:48,653
She's a Federal, but a sister
still. She gave us two loaves.

686
00:57:48,731 --> 00:57:52,326
Well, that's kind of her. You
thank her for us, won't you?

687
00:57:52,402 --> 00:57:57,271
I don't suppose I'll tell her
where it went. That might not do.

688
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:06,214
Well, this good weather has me and
Holt wantin' to fling walnuts...

689
00:58:06,282 --> 00:58:09,342
at mumblety-peg players or
something along those lines.

690
00:58:09,419 --> 00:58:12,286
All right.
Now have fun.

691
00:58:12,388 --> 00:58:15,915
Jake, one hour, please.

692
00:58:24,567 --> 00:58:26,501
"Dearest Ruth Ann,

693
00:58:26,569 --> 00:58:29,902
"I trust this letter
will reach you before winter.

694
00:58:29,973 --> 00:58:33,773
"Here it is always a sort of
winter, as folks are so cold now.

695
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:36,505
"Rebels are out of the city
as far as armies go,

696
00:58:36,579 --> 00:58:39,742
"but there are copperheads
around performing misdeeds.

697
00:58:39,816 --> 00:58:41,977
"So much cruelty goes on.

698
00:58:42,051 --> 00:58:47,284
"Prison is full of rebels and they
are left to waste away so pitifully.

699
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:49,688
"They are traitors
but also human.

700
00:58:49,759 --> 00:58:53,024
"If you looked in on them, you
would not believe that they were...

701
00:58:53,096 --> 00:58:56,327
"for they so resemble
scarecrows now.

702
00:58:56,399 --> 00:58:59,368
"Father believes
the war will go on and on...

703
00:58:59,435 --> 00:59:03,769
"but is ever more committed
to the... struggle.

704
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:09,278
"He manages to send ever greater
numbers of slaves up north...

705
00:59:09,345 --> 00:59:12,872
"to freedom and away from the
grasping hands of their masters,

706
00:59:12,949 --> 00:59:16,976
"who even in the midst of all
attempt to lay claim to them.

707
00:59:17,053 --> 00:59:20,819
"The Confederates claim that we
strike at their liberty and rights,

708
00:59:20,924 --> 00:59:26,157
"but what kind of liberty is it that
takes away the liberty of others?

709
00:59:27,964 --> 00:59:30,398
The war will end. "

710
00:59:36,639 --> 00:59:39,039
Has it been an hour yet?

711
00:59:40,109 --> 00:59:43,044
No, ain't an hour
passed yet.

712
00:59:46,349 --> 00:59:51,548
Roedel,
you know my name?

713
00:59:51,654 --> 00:59:56,591
It's Holt.
No, my whole name.

714
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:01,829
My whole name is Daniel Holt.

715
01:00:03,333 --> 01:00:07,736
Daniel, like that lion's
den man. You know his story?

716
01:00:07,804 --> 01:00:10,364
Of course I do.

717
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:14,968
They throwed Daniel to the
lions, but he weren't never ate.

718
01:00:17,146 --> 01:00:22,550
Daniel.
That's what my mama named me.

719
01:00:29,726 --> 01:00:32,957
Is it an hour now?
An hour and two...

720
01:00:33,029 --> 01:00:37,227
That's the Evans' place.

721
01:00:50,113 --> 01:00:52,581
Jake.

722
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:55,812
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Gunshots in the Evans'.

723
01:00:55,885 --> 01:00:57,785
I heard 'em.

724
01:01:06,596 --> 01:01:07,995
Holt!

725
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:21,504
Jake. Sue Lee, you stay put.
There's gonna be a fight.

726
01:01:25,982 --> 01:01:28,109
Holt, got 'em guns?

727
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:31,210
Take it easy.
Bring her in! Bring her in!

728
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:33,754
Jack Bull, let's go!

729
01:01:35,792 --> 01:01:39,421
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!
