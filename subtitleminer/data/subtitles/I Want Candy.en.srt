00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,434
Dearly beloved,

2
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,712
we are gathered here today to mourn
the passing of a devoted husband,

3
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,592
a loving father, a doting grandfather
and loyal friend.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,560
I was lucky enough
to spend some time with Arthur

5
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,999
towards the end of his illness

6
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:53,989
and, despite the sad circumstances,
I always looked forward to those visits,

7
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,395
knowing that I would be greeted
with the joy and happiness

8
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,797
for which he and Irene were so...

9
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,711
Look, I'm sorry, this won't do.

10
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,558
This family is grieving.
You need to show some more respect.

11
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,956
This family has paid
for a high-quality funeral video.

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,752
A lasting memory of a fond farewell.

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,231
I got you as far as, "I always used
to look forward to the visits."

14
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,078
Look, go away.

15
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,271
Piss off!

16
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,313
Yeah, Bags, I think we've got enough.
This family needs some space to grieve.

17
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,556
OK.

18
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,875
Good job. Thanks, everyone,
for your patience.

19
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,514
That's great. Could you not look
directly in the camera?

20
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,755
I told you to piss off!

21
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,392
Hey, Baggy! Wait up!

22
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,588
Bags!

23
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,997
All right?

24
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,837
So, good news.

25
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,429
Fat Kenny Radford's grandmother died.
Her funeral's on Saturday. Are you in?

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,877
No. Right.

27
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,878
I still think it's a good idea.
Everyone's doing wedding videos.

28
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,310
Funeral videos are a niche market.
We just got a touchy family.

29
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,998
I just want to make my own film.

30
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,032
Come on, Bags. Do you think
George Lucas never struggled?

31
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,834
Ridley Scott, right, had to sell a lung
to buy his first camera. That's a fact.

32
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,591
We'll laugh about this
when we shoot The Love Storm.

33
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,993
Are we? Are we?

34
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,914
There he is,
having a little laugh already. Good.

35
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,350
We'll make the first Oscar-winning
end-of-term project in history.

36
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,195
We can't stop now, man. We're this close.

37
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,515
You are going to be up on that podium,
thanking your mum,

38
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,437
your agent, your producer.

39
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,391
Thank you? Thanking you for what?

40
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,111
- Making me do shit I don't want to do?
- Bags, you're welcome.

41
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,357
Uncovering The Language Of A Visual Event.

42
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,436
Yep, I know what you're thinking.

43
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,597
A major yawnathon, but hear me out,
because this stuff

44
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,038
is effing cool.

45
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,954
So, fasten your seatbelts, we're about
to take a trip into the avant-garde.

46
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,716
In the words of Vanilla Ice,
"Stop, collaborate and listen,"

47
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,275
because the film I'm about to show you
here is important for two reasons.

48
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,516
Uno.

49
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,951
It paved the way for the experimental
Austrian animation of the 1950s.

50
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,119
And, dos, it's a short film.

51
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:31,756
The very same medium we shall be
exploring in our end-of-year projects.

52
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,872
"What's that, Mr D? Short films? Two minutes?"

53
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,751
"No sweat. Easy."

54
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,950
Wrong, sailor, incorrect.

55
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,231
Because it's not about how long it is. Is it?

56
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,078
It's about what you do with it.

57
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:54,915
So, yeah, granted, it's slightly different
from previous years, shorter.

58
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,394
But it's a challenging format and I...

59
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:01,194
Excuse me, Mr Dulberg, sorry.
Our script's a feature film, 90 minutes.

60
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:06,556
Well, if it isn't Leatherhead's
very own Spielberg and Weinstein.

61
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,596
We've been working on it for three years.

62
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,278
Yes, sorry about that, lads.

63
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,754
My bad. I think you've got some editing to do.

64
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,075
What? To two minutes?

65
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,475
Guys, can we,
can we have a bit of realism here?

66
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:21,911
This is Leatherhead University, OK? Not UCLA.

67
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,269
If you want a calling card, go to the printer's.

68
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,717
Maybe it's for the best, darling.

69
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,796
It was going to be our ticket to Hollywood.

70
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,229
- Can I speak for you, Val?
- Always, Stephen.

71
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:41,792
The entertainment industry is
an impossible road, full of obstacles.

72
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,709
Now, we admire your ambition, Joe.
Ambition is everything.

73
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,239
You've got to follow your dream.

74
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:52,070
That way, when you fail, you can always say,
"Well, at least I tried."

75
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,670
Gotcha. Thanks, Dad.

76
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,314
Why don't you come in to work
with me tomorrow?

77
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,750
Get the feel of the place. Start learning
the ropes. It might cheer you up a bit.

78
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,678
That's a wonderful idea, Dad.

79
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,711
Joe?

80
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,113
Yeah, Dad, it sounds great,

81
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,079
but I think I've got to...

82
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,871
do things all day.

83
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,151
Well, let's do it soon, all right?

84
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,590
Term ends in a couple of months and
then I want you trained up, quick-smart.

85
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,870
After that, it's you and me.

86
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,514
Clarke & Son School of Motoring.

87
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,917
Seven top-of-the-range Fiestas.
Walnut dash and a growing client base.

88
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,751
You're set for life.

89
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,231
Could you two find somewhere else to mope?
You're depressing the regulars.

90
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,317
Three years of film school, Lila,
and I'll end up a driving instructor.

91
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,679
At least it's a job, Joe.

92
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,188
- It's a shit job.
- It's an amazing job.

93
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:58,592
It's the only job that is not only extremely boring,
but, at the same time, very, very dangerous.

94
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,232
- I'll be trapped in Leatherhead forever.
- Hey, hey, don't knock Leatherhead.

95
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,556
Sure, Hollywood's all right,
but do they have a Kebabsolutely?

96
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,794
Does it have a big Tesco?

97
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,115
No. No, you're right, it's rubbish.
It's all just bright lights

98
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,152
and cool parties and premieres
and beautiful women.

99
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,634
Grace Kelly, Cameron Diaz. Jessica Rabbit.

100
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,272
Yeah, you know you would.
You'd do Jessica Rabbit in a heartbeat.

101
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,158
You two are pathetic.
You go on and on about Hollywood,

102
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,589
but all you ever do is sit around here
bugging me all day.

103
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,993
You're all bark and no bite.

104
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,076
"All fart and no follow through,"
as my gran would say.

105
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,554
I follow through. I am doing stuff.

106
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,440
- Pestering the recently bereaved?
- It's a niche market.

107
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,630
What I'm saying is,
why are you letting some bitter, jealous,

108
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,910
dead-end college lecturer stand in your way?

109
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:47,111
Did Tarantino ask his teacher for
permission to make Reservoir Dogs?

110
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,639
London is 20 miles down the road,

111
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,399
crammed full of film companies
desperate for good ideas.

112
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,759
Yeah.

113
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,472
Bags, don't be so negative.

114
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:58,672
No, no, you're right. We need to get out there.
We need to get up in their faces.

115
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,392
Let's take this mountain to Mohammed.

116
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,716
Baggy, start the car,
because we are going to London.

117
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:10,357
The film industry is just like
any other business, Bags.

118
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,312
It's all about supply and demand.

119
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,673
Film companies demand a great script and we
are about to supply them with exactly that.

120
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,309
We're like a dream come true for these guys.

121
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,351
And we're going straight to the big dogs.

122
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:25,598
Working Title. The most successful
British film company ever.

123
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,076
So, we're just going to walk in there,
pitch the film and get the money?

124
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,111
Come on, Bags, don't be so negative.

125
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,958
It's like God said to Moses,
"You've got to have faith."

126
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,912
Wasn't that the fella from Wham?

127
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,520
- No, Moses was never in Wham.
- No, I mean...

128
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,790
Hi, there. Joe Clarke, producer.

129
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,871
Oh, my God, do men get lost in your eyes?

130
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:01,677
If you keep pointing those things at me, I'm
going to need a search party, because I am lost.

131
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,355
And I'm hungry.
I may have to eat my friend here.

132
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,159
Tasty!

133
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,111
Hello, Working Title.

134
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,350
Yes.

135
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,630
Wonderful.
OK, Chris, putting you through.

136
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:21,190
- Sorry, sir. You were saying?
- I may have to eat my friend here.

137
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,677
What?

138
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,756
Because of the eyes thing.

139
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,719
You've got massive eyes.

140
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:32,913
- Sorry, can I help you?
- Yes, we're here to pitch a movie.

141
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:36,475
- Right. Do you have an appointment?
- No, but we do have a fantastic script.

142
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,314
- Really?
- Yes. It's perfect for Working Title.

143
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,876
Hang on, because we're Working Title.

144
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,428
This is fantastic news.

145
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:47,189
I'll ring Mr Bevan and Mr Fellner,
the head of the company, really important.

146
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:51,279
They're in a big meeting with Universal Studios,
but I'm sure they won't mind if I drag them out.

147
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,880
I'm going to get them
to read your script straight away,

148
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,718
then the guys and the girls
can start casting and budgeting

149
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,990
and we'll all go out for champagne
and teppanyaki.

150
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,631
- Are you being sarcastic?
- Yes, I am.

151
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,593
You do need an appointment.

152
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,108
I can't see your name here, Mr Clarke.

153
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,390
- I'm sorry.
- Well, keep looking.

154
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,319
Just think, they could have stopped checking at
Preparation G - they would have had nothing.

155
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,072
No? OK. Well, Mr Brown,
it looks like we're in trouble.

156
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,471
- Our appointment's not in the book.
- Are you lan Brown?

157
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,392
I'm Mr Brown.

158
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,479
I'm terribly sorry.
It's under Mr Brown's name and not yours.

159
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,794
- 11 o'clock to see Graham Rose?
- That's right.

160
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,115
- Do you want to go through?
- Yes. Thank you.

161
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,556
It's The Big Chill meets Remains Of The Day.

162
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,318
It's kind of a noir romance,
but with elements of Welles, Capra, Soderbergh.

163
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,271
It's a drama, but it's witty.

164
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,074
Classic themes, but with a contemporary edge.

165
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,838
Baggy, set the stage.

166
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,477
Night. Thunder.

167
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,110
Lightning. Rain.

168
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:56,355
A secluded farmhouse on the edge of town.
Our heroine walks to the door.

169
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,278
Hands bound, face muddied,
a haunted look in her eye.

170
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,272
This is the story of an enigmatic woman

171
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,471
who enters the lives of two people
and changes them forever.

172
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,080
- Enemies become friends...
- Excuse me. Excuse me.

173
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,111
I've got to be honest with you, Mr Brown.

174
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,879
I thought you were just going
to sell me some print cartridges.

175
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,317
That's it, Joe. I want to go home now.

176
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,510
Do you know how long it took
Attenborough to make Gandhi?

177
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,278
It took him ten, long, painful years

178
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,834
and we've been at it for, like,
two and a half hours.

179
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,159
The good news is we're not making
some boring, cry-baby movie

180
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,156
about a bald bloke in a nappy.

181
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,839
Yeah, I know it was a masterpiece,
but you get the picture.

182
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,916
Full steam ahead, my friend, full steam...

183
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,112
Bags! Bags!

184
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,792
It's like a sign.

185
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,389
It is a sign.

186
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,313
If you're looking for Angeline, she's next door.
I should warn you, she used to be a bloke.

187
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,749
No, we've come to see you,
Mr President, sir.

188
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,870
We're filmmakers. We've got an appointment.

189
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,559
Producer Joe Clarke.
This is the director, John Bagley.

190
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,115
We've got a very exciting project for you,
The Love Storm.

191
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,832
Baggy, do the pitch.

192
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,599
Night. Thunder. Lightning. Rain.

193
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,359
- Show these two wankers the door.
- No, no. Look...

194
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,073
I know you're a very busy man,
but we just want two minutes.

195
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,874
This is a great pitch.
We're talking big money, yeah?

196
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,115
Accolades. Awards.

197
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,037
All right, Tweedledee. Two minutes. Go.

198
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,798
Night. Thunder.

199
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,717
Lightning. Rain.

200
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,194
A secluded farmhouse on the edge of town.

201
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,992
This is the story of an enigmatic woman

202
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:25,077
who enters the lives of two people
and changes them forever.

203
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,635
Enemies become friends.
Friends become lovers.

204
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,353
- She was a stranger...
- Then she shagged the lot of them.

205
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,472
Yeah. Am I sensing there isn't enough
sex in this movie for you?

206
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,478
You two tadpoles come wandering in
off the street like Hansel and Gretel.

207
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:43,069
You've got chutzpah, I like that.
I give you two minutes, you never know.

208
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,953
You might have some girl next door
banging yard dogs.

209
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,991
Or a colony of midget friends
shagging each other.

210
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,917
You're calling it ltty Bitty Gang Bang.

211
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,996
Then you start talking about awards,

212
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,554
without one single mention
of the word "pussy".

213
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,159
Do you see that?

214
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,388
Now that is the only thing that gets the
Academy's juices flowing around here.

215
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,513
- Candy Fiveways.
- Do you know who Candy Fiveways is?

216
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,869
Yes. She was in I Candy 2.

217
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,638
- And?
- And...

218
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,712
It was her sexiest role yet.

219
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,910
"We laughed, we cried,
we tugged ourselves dry."

220
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:19,157
Listen, Candy Fiveways is the biggest
name in adult entertainment.

221
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,839
The patron saint of the old Nescafé handshake.

222
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,472
She's got three Cocks.

223
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,597
Golden Cockerels. The Oscars
of the adult entertainment industry.

224
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,551
A first-class ticket to the big time.

225
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,435
Now, if you had her in your film,
we could do business,

226
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,198
but you don't, so we can't and I'm a busy man.

227
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,276
Now your two minutes ended two minutes ago.

228
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,072
Robby, sling 'em out.

229
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,631
That went well. We just got a movie offer.

230
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,075
What?

231
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,076
In amongst the tough-guy stuff was a message.

232
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,873
"A bit of a rewrite, the right cast,
we'll make your movie."

233
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,070
No. No, no. No way.

234
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,270
No, I can't make a film like that.

235
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,676
Everybody started somewhere.
What's wrong with starting in erotica?

236
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,518
Not a chance. I can't do that.

237
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,074
You don't have to do that.
The actress will do that.

238
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,471
Baggy, don't give up on me now.

239
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,034
Sex does not automatically
ruin the movie.

240
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:25,834
Well, Scorsese did have to cut
nude shots into his first feature.

241
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,995
There you go.

242
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,873
They all did.
You could take porn apart, give it a heart.

243
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,117
Could reinvent the genre for
a cine-literate, postmodern audience.

244
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:36,789
Or you could take the The Love Storm
and pop in some shagging.

245
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,477
- Hello, we're home! Hi, Baggy.
- Hi, fellas. How's it going?

246
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,519
You missed another exciting day
at Clarke's School of Motoring.

247
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,471
Three passes and one fail.

248
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,473
- What are you watching?
- This?

249
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,830
It's nothing. Just some stuff for college.
Quite boring, actually.

250
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,920
I see. One of those old,
black-and-white foreign jobs?

251
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,872
- A little bit highbrow, is it?
- Yeah, something like that.

252
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,388
- Where's the remote?
- You had it. Find it. Make it stop.

253
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:04,389
- We like a good thriller, don't we, Valerie?
- Or a comedy. I do love that Ben Stiller.

254
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,715
Yes! Yes! Yes!

255
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,390
Well, then, you wouldn't be interested in this.

256
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,796
This is just academic, highbrow, intellectual stuff.

257
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,789
Yes, that's right. Nothing like a good comedy.

258
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,758
We love a good laugh.

259
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,593
Soapy Tit Wank.

260
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,034
- You call this highbrow?
- Yes.

261
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,554
Yeah, that's...

262
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,878
That's a Czechoslovakian, pre-war,
monochrome, low-budget movie...

263
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,437
about hygiene.

264
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,992
The Shawshank Redemption.
Tragically overlooked by the Oscars.

265
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,113
American Beauty.
Well, Kevin Spacey is amazing in that.

266
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,477
Shaving Ryan's Privates?

267
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,476
Baggy, Shaving Ryan's Privates?

268
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,911
- Research material.
- Research material?

269
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,554
Do you want American Beauty and Shawshank
or just that?

270
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,670
No. Yeah. Of course I do.

271
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:07,759
It really is research for my script, you know,
The Love Storm.

272
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,550
The Love Storm?
Isn't that a psychological romance, with a girl?

273
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,912
Yeah, except the narrative has expanded
to accommodate a sub genre.

274
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,838
Genre splicing. Good idea.
Increase your potential audience.

275
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,632
It's more of a character piece.

276
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:23,114
So, more emotional depth?
It still doesn't explain...

277
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,875
It's more of a porn film.

278
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,598
Right, right, a porn film. You should have said.
But you don't want Shaving Ryan's Privates.

279
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,073
A I bit too much cock in that one.

280
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,430
But if you want to know about porn,
I'll tell you about porn. Come round.

281
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,431
Welcome to my world.

282
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,831
This'll be a voyage of discovery for you, boy.

283
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:53,189
- Hi, I've come to meet Miss Fiveways.
- I wish I could help, but she isn't here.

284
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,275
You're good. You are very good.

285
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,677
A Candy Fiveways film. Your address.

286
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,837
- Busted.
- No, we're the distribution company.

287
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,314
We distribute films made by other people.

288
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,719
You distribute?

289
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,473
That's excellento.
That's valuable work, distribution.

290
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,877
But you must know how to get hold of her.

291
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,036
- Do you have a number?
- We're not really supposed...

292
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,274
Tiffany.

293
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,709
Hey, it's me. It's Joe. Remember?

294
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,715
Hey, look, there. Look at that smile!

295
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,155
That smile is wasted here.
You should be in movies.

296
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,758
- You really think so?
- Yeah.

297
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,870
Come on. How about that number?

298
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,831
I'm not really supposed to, but...

299
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,269
we do have a number here for...

300
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,038
Fiveways International.

301
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,274
This is it.

302
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,469
Tiffany?

303
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:45,991
Without you, this company would sink
without a trace and you know it.

304
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,476
Love you, Tiffany Thomas.

305
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,317
And I love you...

306
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,513
Joe Clarke.

307
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,275
Fiveways International. Clive Purves.

308
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:06,756
Hello there, Clive. Tell me,
do you handle Candy Fiveways?

309
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,628
- Yes, we do.
- Excellent!

310
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,274
I'm a film producer, making a film and...

311
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,233
Well, how do I put this?

312
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,834
I want Candy.

313
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,553
Well, let me see. Candy Fiveways...

314
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,229
Yeah.

315
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:25,752
She's available. Do you want single entry,
double entry or the full executive?

316
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,552
- As in?
- Well, sir, the more you spend,

317
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,113
the more positions are possible.

318
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,151
I mean, she does it all, but for a price.

319
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,237
Yes, silly of me. I don't think we should
limit ourselves at this stage.

320
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,272
- How much for the full executive?
- Let me see. Full executive...

321
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,276
£250 plus VAT.

322
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,911
So, it's that easy?

323
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,598
Tell me, what's she like?

324
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,158
Well, she's got blonde hair,

325
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,838
red lips,

326
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,438
a nice bum.

327
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,630
Is she smart? You know, funny?

328
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,233
She's a doll.

329
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,793
Yeah.

330
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,159
I hear you.

331
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,795
Adult entertainment, erotica, blue movies,
you can call it what you want.

332
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,115
Essentially, all porno is exactly the same.

333
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:16,038
It's boy meets girl. They kiss.

334
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,755
She smokes a little cock, he eats
some hairy pie and then they have sex.

335
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,791
Vaginal first. Romance is not dead.

336
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,070
Then, one up the bum,
no harm done, then more oral.

337
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,678
I don't make the rules. It happens.

338
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,029
Finally, bukkake. She's left embarrassed.

339
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,559
Egg on her face, so to speak.

340
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,715
- Yeah, well, I want to change all that.
- Two pounds, love. You'll enjoy that.

341
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,274
So you want him to come on her first?
How will that work?

342
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,550
You don't understand
the basics of pornography.

343
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,273
It's not based on the same criteria
as regular films.

344
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,356
If someone rents a normal movie,

345
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,358
watches it for ten minutes, switches it off,
it means it was shit.

346
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,358
With pornography, quite the reverse.
It means job done.

347
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:53,029
I want to make the first adult movie
where people want to watch to the end.

348
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,112
They'll tug themselves numb!

349
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,833
But, if you can do it, you'll have
changed the way people think

350
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,314
of gentlemen's special-interest cinema.

351
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,998
If anyone can do it, you can, mate.

352
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,589
One more thing, Baggy.

353
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,916
There's a saying in show business,
"Never work with children or animals."

354
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,552
Nowhere is that truer than porno.

355
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,878
"The sharpest sword cuts silk, not stone."

356
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,754
"The warrior must live like he's already dead."

357
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,438
Come.

358
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,839
Mr Perry,

359
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,512
I know you're a very busy man,
so I won't take up a second of your time.

360
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,516
- I've got Candy.
- Bollocks.

361
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:43,472
For The Love Storm.
You said if I could get Candy Fiveways.

362
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,669
Well, I've got her.

363
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,518
I spoke to her management.
Discussed terms. Agreed a deal.

364
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,118
Bollocks you have!

365
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,151
Yeah. Yeah, you're probably right.

366
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,274
I've had the people at Bell End Pictures
on the phone.

367
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,311
Probably more their sort of thing, anyway.

368
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,229
Robby, get Mr Clarke a chair.

369
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,039
You've got Candy?

370
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:14,470
Her agents drove quite a hard bargain,
but, yeah, everyone's happy.

371
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,479
She's very excited. I'm very excited.

372
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,078
Well, well, well.

373
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,356
Doughnut?

374
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,752
Congratulations, Joe.
I'm a difficult man to impress.

375
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,590
I look forward to working with Miss Fiveways.

376
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:58,950
And I'm sure Miss Fiveways is looking
forward to working with you again.

377
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,434
- Robby!
- You've worked with her before?

378
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:06,153
Yeah. You're a producer. You know
it's all about keeping plates in the air.

379
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:10,274
We did experience a few minor difficulties
with her on our last production.

380
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,470
Cash flow. You know the sort of thing.

381
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:17,036
I bear no grudge, but I do think it would
be best if our involvement was limited

382
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,548
to our subsidiary film-developing arm.

383
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,948
Big Bang Pictures.

384
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,231
- Big Bang Pictures?
- Yeah, Big Bang Pictures.

385
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,071
Think of us as a silent partner.

386
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,997
"Silent" being the operative word.

387
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,111
No-one hears about this deal. Understand?

388
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,912
What deal?

389
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,834
I do not understand. Why would...

390
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,996
Hi, guys. What's the haps?
Can we have a little chat?

391
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,873
We make a film, a political allegory.

392
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:53,517
The chicken, he represent
the suffering of the flightless masses

393
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,996
and the sky, she represent the hope.

394
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:00,112
- And the balloons?
- It's Gabi's birthday.

395
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,594
- Hi.
- So I hear you get money for The Love Storm.

396
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,870
You top-student, filmmaker guys.

397
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,673
And you, top sound, camera, lighting guys.

398
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,869
Listen, we're going to need a crew.

399
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,310
Chicken!

400
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,794
- Brilliant. Are you in?
- No.

401
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:20,719
Sorry, no.
The cinema is like a window to the soul.

402
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:24,275
For us to make a commercial film
would be to ask big-time chef

403
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,639
to make chicken nuggets.

404
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,796
We make chicken in a basket.

405
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,273
Fair enough.

406
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,470
It's not your sort of thing, anyway.

407
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,909
There will be some girls in it and nudity.

408
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,629
Imagine shooting that first scene.

409
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,078
She's walking towards you.

410
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:43,271
Long hair cascades down,
staring right into your eyes.

411
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:47,395
Swinging hips,
fertile, with all of a woman's promise.

412
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,835
Then, she leans forward
and just whispers in your ear...

413
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,711
"It's time for your bed bath."

414
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,511
Her crisp, white nurse's uniform
can barely contain her...

415
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,273
heaving breasts.

416
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,231
She wants you.

417
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,394
She wants you.

418
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:13,116
- But we'll find someone else.
- No, no, we will do it.

419
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,675
- Your chicken's getting away.
- Hey!

420
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,395
OK, people.

421
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,238
Everyone ready? Everyone excited?

422
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:48,317
If a member of staff so much as
glances our way, what's the signal?

423
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:53,752
Right. Then we get rid of anything that doesn't
look like a Ukrainian art-house audition.

424
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,594
Like the girls with their boobies out?

425
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:00,629
For God's sake, Lila.
Grow up. We're making a film here.

426
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:04,798
I know Baggy is, but you're
awfully excited about this casting thing.

427
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:07,149
I can't help thinking it's the boobies.

428
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,794
Hey, I'm realising a dream here.

429
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,276
I was staring at a life in the suburbs,
working for my dad,

430
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:16,995
with nothing to show for myself
except crippling mediocrity,

431
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:20,589
failed ambitions and the overwhelming desire
to have a bath with a toaster.

432
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,108
And now, now, we're all actually
making the movie

433
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,879
that is going to get us out of Leatherhead
and into the big time.

434
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,275
That is why I'm excited, Lila, OK?

435
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,958
That and the boobies.

436
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,076
You have never known what it is to be happy.

437
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,234
But wait.

438
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,316
Uncle Vanya, wait!

439
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,230
We shall rest.

440
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:48,552
That's great, Lucy, really, really great.
We'll be in touch.

441
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:52,033
Sorry. Baggy, didn't you have something else
to ask Lucy?

442
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,832
What? No. No.

443
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,836
That's all for today. Thank you, Lucy.

444
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,394
Hang on. Sorry.
Don't you need to see her without...?

445
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,351
No. No.

446
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,391
- Yes. You definitely said...
- No, I didn't.

447
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,034
Definitely didn't. It's not the kind of thing I'd say.

448
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:08,392
- Joe, maybe you should.
- Where's my pen?

449
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,349
Thank you, Lucy. That's all we need.
We'll be in touch.

450
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,955
OK, so you don't want to see my tits, then?

451
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,309
- That won't be necessary.
- That would be great.

452
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,157
- Won't be necessary.
- We'd love to.

453
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,792
# Shake what your mama gave ya,
left, right and back, back

454
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:25,957
# Shake what your mama gave ya,
shake what your mama gave ya

455
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,072
# Shake what your mama gave ya,
left, right and back, back

456
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:32,311
# Shake what your mama gave ya,
shake what your mama gave ya

457
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,271
# Shake what your mama gave ya

458
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,873
Atten-shun!

459
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,233
Left! Right!

460
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,872
Left! Right!

461
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,309
Left, right! Left, right!

462
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:51,079
Left, right! Left, right! Left, right! Left, right!

463
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,749
I think about what might have been,
but the Jezebel packed her bags...

464
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,277
and went away

465
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:10,118
and I've never been the same again
since that summer.

466
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,071
Thank you...

467
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,634
Carl, that was, that'll be all.

468
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,113
Excuse me.

469
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:21,232
Carl, that was a very brave performance.

470
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,918
I know.

471
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,871
I wrote it myself.

472
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,876
It's just about this really,

473
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,388
really emotional time in my life.

474
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,877
I like to draw on everything I can to make
my acting as deep and as real as it can be.

475
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,434
- Could we see you without your shirt on?
- Absolutely.

476
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,149
Thank you, Carl.

477
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,918
Very nice.

478
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,479
- Joe?
- Yeah. No.

479
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,272
Sorry, mate, you're not really...

480
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,596
- We're looking for something different.
- Great. We'll be in touch.

481
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,308
Yeah?

482
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,634
- Great.
- Great.

483
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,834
Great.

484
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,116
Next!

485
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:14,232
# Way down deep in the middle of the Congo

486
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:17,511
# A hippo took an apricot,
a guava and a mango

487
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:21,394
# He stuck 'em with the others
and danced a dainty tango

488
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:25,477
# The rhino said,
"I know, we'll call it Um Bongo"

489
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,478
# Um Bongo, Um Bongo,
they drink it in the Congo

490
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,919
# Um Bongo, Um Bongo

491
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,871
# They drink it in the Congo

492
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,710
That's great. We'll be in touch.

493
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,795
Did you like it?

494
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,513
Great choice. It's very powerful, very now.

495
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,273
I made a shield.

496
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,357
I love the shield.

497
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,235
Well, that was some of our best moves.

498
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,232
We've set the standard.

499
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,993
That's a very unusual audition piece, Mai Ling.

500
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,713
You can roll me around like a choo-choo train.

501
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,876
The Ping-Pong balls are the steam.

502
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,988
You want even better? I go get peach.

503
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:21,477
# Shake what your mama gave ya,
left, right and back, back

504
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,876
# Shake, shake, shake,
shake, shake, shake, shake, shake

505
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,390
All right, what the hell's going on
and who the hell are you?

506
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,759
Lila Owens.

507
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,279
It's a huge honour.

508
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,756
These two have told me so much about you.
You're a bit of a hero to them.

509
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,189
They admire your ability
to deconstruct modern cinema.

510
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,113
Really?

511
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,431
Well, "hero" is a big word.

512
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,392
I'm just a guy doing his job.

513
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,429
Good job, guys.

514
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,352
Continuez-vous.

515
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:27,110
# Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake,
shake, shake, shake, shake

516
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:30,311
# Shake, shake, shake,
shake what your mama gave ya

517
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,592
Why don't you roll back on in this way?

518
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,074
She's fine, son.
Leave her be, yeah? Leave her be.

519
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,395
OK, good. Then this is our cast.

520
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,150
- What about Candy?
- You said she'd be here.

521
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,272
I have to sort out costumes.
We haven't even got a location yet.

522
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,273
Come on. She said she will be here.
She will be here.

523
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,151
Package for Joe Clarke.

524
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:55,710
Yeah, over here. Lila, let me tell you something.

525
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,751
Not only have I negotiated a fantastic deal

526
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:01,190
with her representative
at Fiveways International,

527
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:06,189
but he also assured me
that she would be here any time now.

528
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:11,075
So, how's about you trot along
and production manage a place for her to relax,

529
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,032
while I prepare myself for the imminent arrival

530
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,640
of one of the most beautiful women
in the world?

531
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,508
Yeah?

532
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,316
I think she's just arrived.

533
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,269
No.

534
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,431
Wow. I'm in shock.

535
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,596
She looks taller on film, don't you think?

536
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,631
You're in shock? Look at her.

537
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,471
Joe! Do you think this is funny?

538
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,158
No. No.

539
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,395
I don't. I'm just saying that...

540
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:53,955
Look, hey, I'm a producer, yeah?
So, I'm going to step up and produce.

541
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,639
There's always problems on a movie shoot.
Everything'll be fine.

542
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:00,759
We saw loads of people today
who will be just as good as Candy Fiveways.

543
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,837
Come on, yeah? Let's cheer up, shall we?

544
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,189
You, with your little down face. Come on!

545
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,034
Hello. What's this?

546
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,150
It's Miss Candy Fiveways. Hello.

547
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,875
Look at your pretty chops.
Hello! Mr Bagley.

548
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,831
Look at her.

549
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,233
Hello.

550
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,950
Miss Owens. Oh, my God,
I'm hot for some lezza action right now.

551
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,313
It's OK.

552
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,833
Joe! Stop it!

553
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,199
Joe, stop!

554
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,312
- Seriously, Joe...
- Yeah?

555
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:37,079
Our investors are expecting
a Candy Fiveways film

556
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,192
- and you've provided them with a blow-up doll.
- Lila.

557
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,390
Sweetheart, it's going to be fine.

558
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,078
We've got a great cast.

559
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,872
Just leave the money to me, OK?

560
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,909
Many people think the butterfly suffers,

561
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:52,838
but the chloroform dulls its senses
and it feels nothing.

562
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,873
This way, it won't struggle
when the pin punctures its body.

563
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,877
So, how's my film?

564
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:03,469
The film? It's great. Yeah. Fully prepped.

565
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,028
Friends become enemies and
enemies have sex with each other.

566
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,879
And our star?

567
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,639
Candy? She's great.
She can't wait to get started.

568
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,793
I find that very surprising.

569
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:18,469
That's all water under the bridge.
We're thick as thieves, these days.

570
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,238
That's wonderful news.

571
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,194
I find it surprising, Doug,

572
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:26,119
because she's taking a break from films
to promote some book she's written.

573
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:30,392
She fancies herself as an author. She's in town
doing book signings at this moment.

574
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,511
You should probably give her a call, Doug.

575
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:36,037
No, there's no need, Mr De Vere.
I've been on the phone to her all week.

576
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,036
She's very excited.

577
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,310
We're very excited. Aren't we?

578
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,553
That's very good, because I paid you
for a Candy Fiveways film

579
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,079
and I expect you to deliver.

580
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,072
Yeah, this is the place.

581
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,952
Don't look much of a film company.

582
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,755
- Are you Mr Dulberg?
- Guilty as charged.

583
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:09,031
I'm looking for Joe Clarke.
The lady at the desk said to talk to you.

584
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,116
Right. Yeah, Joe's one of my students.

585
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,513
Not in at the moment. Probably gone home.
Sorry, you are?

586
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,039
I'm his dad. This is his brother.

587
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,032
Right, well, great kid.
A lot of fun. Well done, you.

588
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:24,430
We were hanging out in the rehearsal
room earlier, having a right laugh.

589
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,471
Always got something to say.
Can't shut him up.

590
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:29,830
Well, I'll see if I can shut him up for you.
What's his address again?

591
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,629
I thought Joe lived at home with you
and Mrs Clarke.

592
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,711
Yeah, of course he does. Where's that?

593
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,595
- What?
- What?

594
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,914
You don't know where you live?

595
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,793
We both know I know where I live,
but do you know where I live?

596
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,839
Well, I can't just give out students' addresses.

597
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,079
We have the old student-teacher
bond of trust, yawn, but...

598
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,749
But it's not his address, is it? It's my address.
Surely you can give me my address?

599
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,152
8, Chester Crescent.

600
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,434
Hello. Can I help you?

601
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,153
Mr Clarke?
I'm Mr Dulberg, Joe's teacher from college.

602
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,879
Right. Well, it's a bit late, Mr Dulberg.
No trouble with Joe, I trust?

603
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,918
- Joe? No, no, good as gold.
- You've just missed him.

604
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,349
He won't be back for a while.
I'll tell him you called.

605
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,914
No, don't put yourself out on my account. I'll wait.

606
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,676
There he is!

607
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:37,269
I was telling Valerie and Stephen
what a Jack-the-lad you were at college.

608
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,515
Mr Dulberg here has been waiting
for over an hour.

609
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,872
Mr Dulberg?

610
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:48,471
Yes. He very kindly dropped by to...
What exactly did you drop by for?

611
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:51,273
I would very much like to talk it out with you,
one to one.

612
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:55,391
Show Valerie and Stephen into
the dining room, would you, Robby?

613
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,635
- You want us in the dining room?
- Please.

614
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,591
Got any Wagon Wheels?

615
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,589
Nice suit.

616
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:07,477
Mr Perry, whatever deal we have is between us,
so leave my parents out of it.

617
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,557
Joe, as the executive partner of our film,

618
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:13,990
I've dropped round to double-check
a couple of things before we start rolling.

619
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:18,192
Chiefly, whether you do, indeed, have Candy,
as you say.

620
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:22,436
- Any particular reason?
- We've got a little issue with our investor.

621
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,072
He's not as easy-going as I am.

622
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:26,918
He's what we, in the trade, call "an evil bastard".

623
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:31,078
If he thought you'd been spending
his ill-gotten gains on flash suits and hair gel,

624
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,953
let's just say he'll find you and your friend...

625
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,558
Baggy, is it?

626
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,114
Well, that's...

627
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,993
That's lucky, then, because we've got her.

628
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,279
Yep.

629
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,153
Rest assured, she is signed,
sealed and delivered.

630
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,236
How long have you been working
at the college?

631
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,508
I don't work at the college.

632
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,120
We thought you were an associate
of Mr Dulberg's.

633
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,276
I only just met him. I don't know Mr Dulberg.

634
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,468
- Why are you here, then?
- I don't know.

635
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,719
- Ask Doug.
- Who's Doug?

636
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,791
I don't know!

637
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,954
More 'Bena?

638
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:11,230
I spoke to her this morning, actually,
and she's really looking forward to it.

639
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,475
Jets in tomorrow from LA.

640
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:17,229
No more bullshit!
She's in London, promoting her poncy book.

641
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,396
Now, you promised me a Candy Fiveways film.

642
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,638
I've promised our investor a Candy Fiveways
film. And that's what we're going to get.

643
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:27,116
- Or?
- Or I'I kill you.

644
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,677
Can I come in now?

645
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,550
You little monkey.
What am I going to do with you?

646
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:39,229
Now, look, Mr Dulberg, we'd like to
know what the blue blazes is going on.

647
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,271
Keep your knickers on. Our job is done here.

648
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:44,357
Valerie, now, you've got a great kid here,
good as gold.

649
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,119
Always brings me an apple,
stays late to wipe the blackboard

650
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,673
and doesn't fuck about too much.

651
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,918
I'm covering the visual event, Mr Dulberg.
I'm on it.

652
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,712
Don't worry. We'll see ourselves out.

653
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,311
Bye, Robby.

654
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,708
He's a bit eccentric,
but he's a bloody good teacher.

655
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,869
How are we going to recognise her? Think she
looks like the doll? Shall we stick a pin in her?

656
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,230
Stop being so negative, Bags.
She'll be the one signing the books.

657
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:33,671
We'll approach her directly this time,
skip the agent. Trust me, I'm a producer.

658
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,673
She's the one signing the books.

659
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,794
OK, there are minders either side of her...

660
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,639
# Yes!

661
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,629
Bags?

662
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,512
- Come back...
- Well, this is lovely. Thanks for inviting me.

663
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:04,993
- You do know how to charm a lady.
- Lila, I need your help.

664
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,519
I'm in a shitload of trouble.

665
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,392
- Hi. What's your name?
- Sam.

666
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,713
Sam?

667
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,999
- Did you enjoy the film?
- Yeah.

668
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:20,316
I've probably watched it about
a hundred, a hundred and fifty times.

669
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,112
I've nearly worn out the disc.

670
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,554
Well...

671
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,670
Play it again, Sam.

672
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,712
OK, I will.

673
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,875
Could you make it out to my wife?
Her name's Dave.

674
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,592
That was a misquote from Casablanca.
I don't know if I can look at you.

675
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,438
- Yes, I can.
- My, a punter with a brain.

676
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:42,597
- "It's my second favourite organ."
- Woody Allen's Sleeper.

677
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,471
I knew it was a misquote, by the way.

678
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,718
- Yeah. Sure. Of course you did.
- I did!

679
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,558
Well, as Oscar Wilde once said, "Whatever."

680
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:53,876
I can't believe you've got us making
a porno for a bunch of gangsters.

681
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,309
This is unbelievable, even by your standards.

682
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,318
What are you going to tell Baggy?

683
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:02,239
You can't tell him, Lila. You know what he's like.
He'll freak out. He'll crumble.

684
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,998
He's a stammering wreck at the best of times.

685
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,713
You're out of your mind, Fiveways.
It must be the heat.

686
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:11,675
And you call yourself a film buff?
You're clearly insane. I should call security.

687
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:15,110
I'm sorry. Mission To Moscow was
never as good as Citizens On Patrol.

688
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,116
Miss Fiveways, the queue.

689
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,833
Sorry. Duty calls.

690
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,759
You want me to sign this?

691
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:24,758
I want you to read it. I wrote it for you.

692
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:29,399
Well, I'm on sabbatical.

693
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,670
No porn films till next year. Publisher's orders.

694
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,517
Don't think of it as a porn film.

695
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:36,154
Think of it as a film
with scenes of an adult nature.

696
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:40,798
- Please, just read it, yeah?
- OK.

697
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:42,994
Cheers.

698
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,835
Hello. I came here from Düsseldorf to see you.

699
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:52,989
Please write as follows.
"To Rudi. Last night was unglaublich.

700
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,429
You have the greatest balls in Germany."

701
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,319
OK.

702
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:01,313
Yes, I know. OK, I'm an idiot,
but I don't want to die.

703
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:06,593
Just give them their money back. Forget the
whole thing. You've still got the money, right?

704
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,790
- Right?
- What?

705
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,077
You don't have the money, do you?

706
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,997
The suit, the watch, the mobile.

707
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,157
The blow-up doll I thought was an actress.

708
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,634
- You're not taking this seriously.
- I am. I promise.

709
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,958
- That's for lying to us.
- I'm sorry and I was wrong. Again.

710
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,276
- For letting down your best friend.
- Deserves more than that. One more.

711
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,948
- One more.
- No.

712
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,195
- You're enjoying it, you pervert!
- I am, yeah.

713
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,151
- Dirty...
- Hi, guys. What's happening?

714
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,509
- Hi, Baggy. We were just chatting.
- Chatting.

715
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,798
Yeah, I spoke to Candy. I gave her the script.

716
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,319
You? Really?

717
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,237
She's reading it. She's going to call us.

718
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,396
That's it. She's not going to call.

719
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,670
She hates the script. We might as well give up.

720
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:52,598
Well, on the plus side,
I've found us a new location.

721
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,791
That's brilliant, Liles.
Great. What shall we use it for?

722
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:59,435
A massive party? A bring-and-buy sale?
A charity sales-a-thon?

723
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,553
Hello. Hi.

724
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,994
Yeah. They're, they're called...

725
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:18,672
- Big Bang Pictures.
- Big Bang Pictures of Soho.

726
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,397
A high-end, professional production outfit.
OK. OK.

727
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,908
Yeah, that sounds, that sounds reasonable.

728
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:25,949
OK.

729
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,839
Bye. Bye-bye.

730
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,793
What happened?

731
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,671
A busy day as a top director is what happened.

732
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,836
- What did she say?
- She read it.

733
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,996
She likes it. She'll meet us tomorrow.

734
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,913
Take the library books back before nine
or there's a surcharge.

735
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,518
Don't forget Joe's trousers.

736
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:46,870
Jeepers Creepers! It's 7:34.
Time to slip into gear, Valerie.

737
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,956
Mirror, signal, manoeuvre.

738
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:53,353
- Come on, love.
- Have a good day at college, darling.

739
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,996
Have a great day.

740
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,269
Morning, Liles.
We can't be late. Where are we going?

741
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,556
Yes. Actually, I wanted to talk to you about that.

742
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:14,509
Morning, Bagster. You all right?

743
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,118
All set for the big day?

744
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,394
Cristi.

745
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,351
- Looking good.
- Thank you.

746
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,630
Liles, focus. Location.
Where are we going to go?

747
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,193
Just try and keep an open mind.

748
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,359
Hello, Joe.

749
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,676
- It's here, innit?
- Hiya.

750
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,153
No. No way. I'm not...

751
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:36,398
No sets to build, no location fees.
You can set your watch by your parents' routine.

752
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,714
They'll have no idea.

753
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,233
I'm going to kill you.

754
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,868
Joe, I need to talk to you. In private.

755
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,672
- Can we go upstairs, please?
- Hold on.

756
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:19,109
This could be the moment
we've been waiting for.

757
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:28,359
I didn't sleep last night.
Can we discuss this? This is important.

758
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,831
Fasten your seat belts, Bagster.

759
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,198
The Fiveways has landed.

760
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,878
Oh, my God.

761
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:41,588
# Yes

762
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:44,356
# Yeah

763
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:11,715
- Hi.
- Miss Fiveways, Joe Clarke, producer.

764
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,239
Hi, Joe. Nice to meet you.

765
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,038
Welcome.

766
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,071
- Should we go in?
- Go inside?

767
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:19,959
Thank you.

768
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:25,238
Morning, Mr Rogers. Lovely day for it.

769
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:32,989
So...

770
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,235
this is Sound Stage 1.

771
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,032
It's compact, but it's efficient.

772
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:41,033
Make-up's on the mezzanine level.

773
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:43,469
- And these are two of our talented cast.
- Hi.

774
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:46,398
- And catering's towards the rear.
- Hi.

775
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:50,149
- Let me show you to the beverage counter.
- Baggy? Baggy, are you OK?

776
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:53,033
No, I'm not. This whole thing's not going to work.

777
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:55,514
The character motivation is not fully developed.

778
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:59,189
The second act through-line is weak.
The subplots are underwritten.

779
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:02,789
- Just calm down.
- I want this to stop. It's stopped. I've stopped it.

780
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:04,068
- Come on.
- The script...

781
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:08,636
May I introduce you to three of the hottest
creative technicians in the business?

782
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:12,156
This is Gabi, our sound recordist.
He's big news in Poland.

783
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:17,473
This is Cristi, cinematographer.
He's award-winning, multi-talented.

784
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:20,274
And this is Vlad, our lighting technician.

785
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,998
- Sorry.
- Where's John?

786
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:25,439
Baggy?

787
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:27,038
He must be fine-tuning the script.

788
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:33,276
Come on, Baggy, just relax.

789
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:36,073
Sex is the most natural thing in the world.

790
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:37,838
I'm trying, Lila. I just can't.

791
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:40,348
- It's not hard, Baggy.
- I know. I know.

792
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:43,714
Baggy, it isn't hard and I know you can do it.

793
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:46,228
I just feel so inadequate.

794
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:48,794
- It's not hard.
- I know. I know. I'm sorry.

795
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:50,034
Back in a sec.

796
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,310
- Baggy, come on.
- I'm all out of juice.

797
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:54,749
You just need to take yourself in hand.

798
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:00,113
...say this is the way in...

799
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:07,113
Baggs, you have got to snap out of it.

800
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:11,471
How long have we wanted this?
There is an actress downstairs,

801
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:14,273
who'll think we're the biggest bunch
of amateurs ever.

802
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:17,232
She's going to walk any second
unless we do something.

803
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,998
- Is there anything wrong?
- Candy.

804
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:21,949
Hello. No. Just having a...

805
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,753
- It's a budget meeting.
- Listen, we need to talk.

806
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:29,478
I can see you've put a lot
into setting up this film.

807
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:34,275
I mean, it's pretty impressive
for a bunch of film students

808
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:38,869
working on a shoestring budget
with little or no experience.

809
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:43,153
And it can't be easy shooting
in your parents' house while they're at work.

810
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:48,316
But I'm here because
this is a great script that deserves to be made.

811
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:54,000
So, I'd like for you all to leave now,
so that I can speak with my director.

812
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:57,033
- That's first-night nerves. He'll be fine.
- Alone.

813
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:59,711
We'll be outside.

814
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:12,875
I'm sorry. I'm a failure.
"I give failures a bad name."

815
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:16,637
It's time you stopped quoting
other people's films, John.

816
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:19,035
And start quoting from The Love Storm.

817
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:20,638
John, this is your big chance.

818
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:22,991
You don't understand.

819
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:28,553
You think Fellini never doubted himself?
You think Spielberg was never scared?

820
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:32,271
We were all first-timers once, Baggy,
Fellini, Spielberg...

821
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:35,753
- Micklewhite.
- Yeah.

822
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:38,519
- Who?
- Alice Micklewhite.

823
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:41,757
Bottom-of-the-class Alice,
pigtails-and-freckles Alice.

824
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:43,670
Me.

825
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:47,556
So where did "Candy Fiveways" come from?

826
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:52,150
Haven't you ever played the
"what's your porn-star name" game?

827
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:56,035
You take the name of your first pet
and the street you grew up on.

828
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,911
Candy was this horrible cat,

829
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,632
but I loved her.

830
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:05,196
And I grew up on the corner
of this busy intersection, Fiveways.

831
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:08,118
- "Candy Fiveways."
- So it is just a made-up name?

832
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:11,470
There aren't really five ways?

833
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:16,351
I've got so much to teach you.

834
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,358
# Hello there, everybody

835
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:25,273
The Love Storm.
Slate one. Scene one. Take one.

836
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:28,670
- Camera set.
- Action.

837
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:30,597
# Action
# Come on

838
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:32,068
# Action

839
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:34,680
# Action
# I want to see all the birds on the floor

840
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:37,188
# I want some action in the morning

841
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:39,470
Even the way she walks is sexy.

842
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:42,798
# I want some action with you

843
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:45,274
Hello. Can I help you?

844
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,276
I need someone to please undo these...

845
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:50,512
Cut!

846
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:53,794
Can we do that again
without the old guy, please?

847
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:55,193
Take two.

848
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:59,517
- OK. Camera set.
- Action.

849
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:07,515
What do you think she did to Baggy up there?

850
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:10,552
By the looks of him,
I'd say she did all five ways.

851
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,272
All five?

852
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,791
"Hello. Can I help you?"

853
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:18,751
I need someone to please help me.

854
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:23,837
- But I, but I've never met...
- Cut!

855
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,911
Lila, go and talk to our friend, please?

856
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:31,708
Sorry, we're just trying to make a film over there.

857
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:33,393
Would you mind...?

858
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,672
Action.

859
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:41,639
Hello.

860
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,558
- Can I help you?
- I need someone to please undo these.

861
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:47,592
But this is the first time
I've met you in my entire life.

862
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:50,357
But I need you.

863
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:54,112
In that case, you'd better come inside.

864
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,115
Cut! Fantastic.

865
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:03,792
Thank you, sir. How much are these?

866
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:16,431
# Bow-wow wow-wow

867
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:19,232
# If you treat me like a dog

868
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:23,193
# Then I'll just get down on all fours
and bark and howl all night

869
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:30,236
# I don't need no behavioural psychologist

870
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,591
# If you treat me like a dog

871
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:39,633
# Then I'll just get down on all fours
and bark and howl all night

872
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:46,192
# Talking Rin Tin Tin or Lassie with a twist

873
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:57,878
Apparently, it was some kind of localised
power surge. The college wasn't affected.

874
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:00,753
It'll be Mr Harper at No.12
with his industrial strimmer.

875
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,552
I know. I know. He's so selfish.

876
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:05,033
Damn you, Mr Harper!

877
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:08,712
# Hello, there, everybody

878
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,677
# Action
# Party, party

879
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:11,755
# Come on, love

880
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:13,233
# Yeah
# Action

881
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:15,157
# Swing them luggies, all right?

882
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,918
# Action
# Come on

883
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:18,188
# Action

884
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:20,834
# Action
# I want to see all the birds on the floor

885
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:23,189
# I want some action in the morning

886
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:25,997
That's mine!

887
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:29,148
Miss Fiveways, sorry, can I have a quick word?

888
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:33,955
All things considered, I think you know
me well enough to call me Candy.

889
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,836
Candy.

890
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,029
I just wanted to...

891
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:40,878
I just wanted to thank you
for "helping" Baggy the other day.

892
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:43,751
- It's my pleasure.
- Was it?

893
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:46,034
Was it?

894
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:47,513
Because...

895
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:52,079
you know, we all need
a little bit of help, once in a while.

896
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:00,551
Thank God!

897
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,633
You don't know how long
I've waited to hear you say that.

898
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:06,192
Really?

899
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,918
I really want you.

900
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:12,794
This is...

901
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:14,399
That is amazing!

902
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,797
Go on, go on, teach me.

903
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:18,876
Yeah, show me the fifth way.

904
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:27,709
OK.

905
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:32,953
So, Baggy, what am I supposed
to be feeling in this scene?

906
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,958
When you come in, you should be like,
"Whoa, what's going on?"

907
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,560
But don't say it.
Do it with your eyes, like, "Whoa."

908
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:42,079
Joe?

909
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:45,759
What are you doing?

910
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:47,876
- Candy. I'm waiting for Candy.
- What?

911
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:52,351
She's going to show me the fifth way.

912
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:53,628
- Really?
- Yeah.

913
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:56,918
She said I needed to be fully lubed up.

914
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:59,952
I couldn't find any baby oil,
so I used a little bit of butter

915
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,275
and she said that's even better, so...

916
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,517
- Wow! You're a natural.
- Yeah.

917
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:09,512
It's actually going to happen, Liles.
A film-star woman!

918
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:10,675
Jessica Rabbit.

919
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:14,110
Jessica Rabbit went home 20 minutes ago.
She's done for the day.

920
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:16,396
Pardon?

921
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:19,319
Yeah. I think she's messing with you.

922
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:22,033
No. No. Cos...

923
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:24,071
She meant it. I could tell. She was really...

924
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:26,031
I don't know, she was sexy.

925
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:27,873
She meant it.

926
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,672
Well,

927
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:33,759
seeing as we're alone
and you're all greased up,

928
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:36,597
it seems a shame to let you go to waste.

929
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:39,753
I want you.

930
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:42,433
God, Joe, I want you.

931
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:44,795
Really?

932
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:49,194
No. Just messing with you.

933
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:03,837
No, I've mentioned hoover bags,

934
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:06,674
Yes. We need some more cleaning
tablets for the dishwasher.

935
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,070
I'm sure we had a full tub of this yesterday.

936
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:11,635
Dad!

937
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:13,109
It's...

938
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:15,628
It's 7:34. Shouldn't you be slipping into gear?

939
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:18,470
"Mirror, signal, manoeuvre."

940
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:23,076
Someone wants us out of the way
so they can get on with their special film.

941
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:28,077
Yes. Your mother and I are very
excited about it. We can't wait to see it.

942
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:30,192
You want to see it?

943
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:33,710
Well, of course we want to see it.
It's your two-minute masterpiece, innit?

944
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:38,749
We can't wait to see what you've come up with
for your college film.

945
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:40,959
Shooting it today.

946
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:48,358
OK, guys, this is going to be the
two-minute film short for Mr Dulberg.

947
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,391
Take one.

948
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:57,591
- Cut.
- Sorry. Sorry.

949
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:01,309
- Yeah. Hello.
- One more week, then you deliver.

950
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:04,919
OK, Mum. That's, that's not a problem.

951
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:11,391
Well, if you don't, I'm going to find you
and then, if I find you, I'm going to kill you.

952
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:14,833
That sounds great.

953
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:19,355
- Looking forward to it. Can't wait.
- Yeah. I bet you can't.

954
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:23,274
Baby. Sweetness.

955
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:26,511
- See you soon.
- OK.

956
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:28,559
Yeah, I'll see you soon.

957
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:31,950
Love you.

958
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,309
Yeah, I love you, too. All right.

959
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:35,429
Bye. Bye.

960
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:43,472
- Everything all right?
- It's fine. It's all fine.

961
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:44,839
She's a super lady.

962
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:47,118
- Turn it off.
- OK.

963
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:49,157
Again.

964
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:53,479
Candy, are you happy?

965
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:55,272
Happy.

966
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:57,072
Carl, are you ready?

967
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:58,838
I was born ready.

968
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:05,355
Wow.

969
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:10,954
- Scene...
- Wait! Wait. Wait.

970
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:21,317
Scene 23. Take one.

971
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:25,829
And action.

972
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:29,156
My wife thinks I should ask you to stay.

973
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:33,032
- Are you going to?
- I haven't decided yet.

974
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:38,876
- What do you think?
- Depends.

975
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:40,512
How good are you with rejection?

976
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:02,194
Lila, could we have some Wet Wipes
over here, please?

977
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:04,515
Take two.

978
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:06,918
Just a couple more minutes.

979
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:08,310
Maybe.

980
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:11,348
Take six.

981
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:14,434
Come on, Carlito. Wake up, little man.

982
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:15,874
Up. Rise.

983
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:18,955
Take seven.

984
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:28,435
Maybe this'll help.

985
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:35,160
I don't even remember seeing that
on the props list.

986
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:37,111
Joe, that's not one of our props.

987
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:39,071
She just got that out of the drawer.

988
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:40,633
What?

989
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:43,433
Well, why would there be a vibrator
in my parents'...?

990
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:45,391
God, no! No, no, no, no!

991
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:47,032
Cut! Cut! Cut!

992
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:48,638
That is disgusting!

993
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:55,111
Hey, morning, Joe!

994
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:01,074
# I know a girl who's tough but sweet

995
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:05,519
# She's so fine, she can't be beat

996
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:10,120
# Got everything that I desire

997
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:14,958
# Sets the summer sun on fire

998
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:18,790
# I want Candy

999
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:23,356
# I want Candy

1000
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:37,313
It's delicious.

1001
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:39,874
# Oughta see her with her hair hung down

1002
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:44,274
# Ain't no finer girl in town

1003
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:48,880
# Candy's just what the doctor ordered

1004
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:53,678
# She's so sweet, she makes my mouth water

1005
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:57,675
# I want Candy

1006
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:00,989
# I want...

1007
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:07,111
- Are you sure it's all right?
- Three cancellations in one day, Val?

1008
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:11,233
I think somebody up there is ordering us
to take a little much-needed R&R.

1009
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:14,434
Stephen. You're a bad boy.

1010
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:17,793
104. Take three.

1011
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:24,949
And action.

1012
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:28,711
- Do you love him?
- How am I meant to know?

1013
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:30,751
You feel his breath on your neck,

1014
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:35,435
and your skin reaches for his touch.

1015
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:38,158
He brushes your arm

1016
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:41,913
and his fingerprint tingles for a minute.

1017
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:47,469
You can't close your eyes without seeing him.

1018
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:51,434
But you wouldn't change a thing,

1019
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:54,233
because everything's brighter
than it was a week ago.

1020
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:10,672
Shit. Everybody, back door!

1021
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:12,634
I didn't agree to that.

1022
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:16,636
Don't cut. And, Candy, pick up that line from...
"and you churn".

1023
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:19,911
No! No! My parents are here.
Everyone, we have to go now.

1024
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:21,518
- Now!
- Ten seconds. Go.

1025
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:35,112
While we've got the house to ourselves, why
don't you give me some special driving lessons?

1026
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:37,549
You do need some help
with your parallel parking.

1027
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:47,559
Here, hold this.

1028
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:49,359
It tickles.

1029
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:54,151
Afternoon, Mr Rogers. Nice day for it.

1030
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:59,268
...everything's brighter than it was a week ago.

1031
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:04,115
- We've got it. Cut.
- Go! Go! Go, go! Go, go, go!

1032
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:05,673
We're going!

1033
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:20,830
- Get out! Get out!
- Run! Run!

1034
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:40,752
- You're coming with me, Mrs Clarke.
- Meow, Mr Clarke!

1035
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:46,069
We need a little music.

1036
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:47,109
There.

1037
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:55,070
I think if I just undo this little thing here,

1038
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:57,236
and take this down here.

1039
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,992
Hello, Joe. Why have your parents...?

1040
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:18,989
Stephen.

1041
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:25,316
Your whole family want to be in the porn star.

1042
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:28,079
Doctor...

1043
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:31,791
- Doctor!
- Doctor?

1044
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:36,990
- I'm going to lick you like a stamp.
- That's right.

1045
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:41,115
- Give me your shirt.
- I'm going to flip you over like a pancake.

1046
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:43,676
Trousers, too. Trousers!

1047
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:45,312
We need to make a rope.

1048
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:50,028
Now, how about if I...

1049
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:54,999
Come on, help me.

1050
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:57,110
- No.
- Not even if I do this?

1051
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:59,875
Who's your driving instructor?

1052
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:05,628
- Who's your driving instructor?
- Hold that end. Hold it tight, OK?

1053
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:07,750
You, Daddy! You!

1054
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:21,556
Your mum is a dirty vixen!

1055
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:38,236
It's no good. I can't wait any longer. I'm bursting.

1056
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:40,748
Hold it in. Do the breathing.

1057
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:44,718
No, is no good. Is coming.

1058
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:46,796
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait.

1059
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:16,552
Thank God.

1060
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:21,434
Whoops.

1061
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:27,433
Mum. We didn't hear you come home.

1062
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:32,434
This is Vlad.

1063
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:33,913
Plumber.

1064
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:36,076
Just popped in to fix the toilet.

1065
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:39,718
I didn't know it was broken.

1066
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:43,032
It's not any more. He's a very good plumber.

1067
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:47,632
- Do you want me to show you out?
- Yes.

1068
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:49,671
- OK, it's just this way.
- Thank you.

1069
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:54,633
Dad, Vlad. Vlad, Dad.

1070
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:00,509
Ladies and gentlemen, The Love Storm.

1071
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:02,471
The Love Storm!

1072
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:04,192
Joe, wrong one.

1073
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:06,037
No, it's not that. That is...

1074
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:07,832
That's the second-best film ever made.

1075
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:10,189
That's two minutes of teacher-pleasing magic.

1076
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:16,190
But this, this is, without doubt,
the most intelligent, moving,

1077
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:19,710
and downright-horny little adult film
that Lila has ever seen.

1078
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:22,832
That's saying something,
because she's a dirty little monkey.

1079
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:28,274
So, here's to you guys,
the wonderful cast and crew of The Love Storm.

1080
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:31,312
- Thanks, everybody.
- The Love Storm!

1081
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:32,634
The Love Storm.

1082
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:36,193
- Candy, I want to tell you that I...
- I know.

1083
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:48,357
Greetings, fellow pornographers.
We having a party, are we? Very nice.

1084
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:52,188
- What the hell are you doing here?
- It's been a long time.

1085
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:54,959
Honestly, woman,
you don't phone, you don't write.

1086
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,309
I don't know what's going on here, but...

1087
01:05:57,360 --> 01:06:00,477
- What is going on here?
- All right, Van Damme, calm down.

1088
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:03,637
What? A new admirer, is it?
Yeah, he's very cute.

1089
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:05,671
Can't I have a drink with my leading lady?

1090
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:08,314
Wishful thinking, but my agent already told you.

1091
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:11,909
- I don't work for low-rent pimps like you.
- But, sweetheart, you just did.

1092
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:16,996
Joe, what a pickle we've caused
with our little deception.

1093
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:20,999
- Joe, what?
- You bastard. I trusted you.

1094
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:26,117
I trusted you.

1095
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:30,992
Time of the month, is it?

1096
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,753
Lads? Yes? No?

1097
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:37,871
Suit yourselves.

1098
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:39,990
Now...

1099
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:43,715
- Where's my film?
- No way. We had a deal, silent partners.

1100
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:48,798
- This is our film. This is Baggy's film.
- We've got a contract and it's my film.

1101
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:50,114
There you go. Take it.

1102
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:52,071
Baggy, what?

1103
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:54,588
It's over, Joe. Forget it. This is all bullshit.

1104
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:56,471
- Good luck with the screening.
- But...

1105
01:06:57,960 --> 01:06:59,871
Trouble in paradise?

1106
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:01,638
You know what, Joe?

1107
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:04,310
You remind me of me when I was your age.

1108
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:08,273
Except I didn't make so many cock-ups
and I was a little better-looking.

1109
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:09,594
And I wasn't such a twat.

1110
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:16,758
Is yours on soon?

1111
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:19,875
- Where's Baggy?
- I don't know. I haven't seen him.

1112
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:23,431
Yeah, big up Diego Meriachi.
Where are you, buddy?

1113
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:26,392
There he is. Respect is due, brother.
Radical stuff.

1114
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:30,752
OK, next up,
and a highly-anticipated collaboration.

1115
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:32,199
John Bagley and Joe Clarke.

1116
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:34,629
This one has been shrouded in mystery,

1117
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:38,309
so I guess we're looking at
a world premiere, here, folks.

1118
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:43,914
What do you say we kick back and enjoy
Uncovering The Language Of A Visual Event.

1119
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:50,670
- Baggy!
- Joe, I had to come and speak to you.

1120
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:54,599
No, I know. It's been tough.
Doug, Candy, Lila, it's my fault.

1121
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:57,359
I switched the films.
I had to see it on a big screen.

1122
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:00,596
- What?
- Yeah.

1123
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:18,119
That looks like our house.

1124
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:22,030
It is our house!
Joe didn't tell us he was using...

1125
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:27,029
Hello. Can I help you?

1126
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:30,436
I need someone to please undo these.
Please let me in.

1127
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:34,155
The sound isn't very good,
but picture quality is better than I expected.

1128
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:40,113
I think you're going to be impressed,
Mr De Vere.

1129
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:42,230
It's different from our usual product.

1130
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:45,078
It's got heart. It's got soul.

1131
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:49,318
It's got a pile of hard-earned cash resting on it,
so shut up and put it on.

1132
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:19,271
You're a dead man.

1133
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:22,759
Maybe this'll help.

1134
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:27,875
Bend over.

1135
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:48,592
- Oi! Where's my porno?
- Doug.

1136
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:55,359
No way!

1137
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:57,709
- Holy shit!
- Will you shut up?

1138
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:00,593
- Not bad.
- You're not wrong there, Robby.

1139
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:19,918
What was she doing with that pear?

1140
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:33,671
- Joe, Joe, congratulations. What a premiere!
- Joe, could we have a word?

1141
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:36,712
- Joe, what...
- Good, Mr Clarke, a quick chat.

1142
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:38,398
Mr Dulberg, I think we need to talk.

1143
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:40,670
Excuse me. I'd like a word with Joe's...

1144
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:41,914
- Teacher.
- Dad.

1145
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:43,552
- I'm Joe's teacher.
- I'm Joe's dad.

1146
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:45,397
- This is Joe's dad.
- This is Joe's teacher.

1147
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:47,078
- Mr Clarke?
- Mr Dulberg?

1148
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:48,678
Who is this man?

1149
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:51,109
Listen, I am telling you, I am Joe's father.

1150
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:54,793
I did come here
with the express purpose of killing you,

1151
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:58,435
but, seeing as you produced a work
of such outstanding quality,

1152
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:02,996
and I'll probably have to stand in line
for the privilege, I'm going to leave you to it.

1153
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:05,634
But Mr Dulberg came to my house.

1154
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:08,558
Rewind. I've never been to your house in my life.

1155
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:10,196
Right.

1156
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:13,073
- How dare you use our house...
- You think you're pretty clever.

1157
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:15,475
...your mother's in a state.
...a stunt like this.

1158
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:17,476
- She's talking about Florida.
- Stephen.

1159
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:23,117
You, the pair of you,
can forget about your diplomas.

1160
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:25,628
You can forget about coming back to class.
That...

1161
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:27,830
That was totally uncool, guys.

1162
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:35,515
It's good. It's really very good.

1163
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:39,632
And you made this yourself?
You're a dark horse, Douglas.

1164
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:42,069
I think we might be in the running
for a Golden Cockerel.

1165
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:44,998
A Cock? What, for me?

1166
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:46,473
I mean, for us?

1167
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:48,033
And the winners are...

1168
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:50,913
Michael De Vere and Douglas Perry.

1169
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:54,153
You keep this up, Doug,
and I might actually start to like you.

1170
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,991
It's my best work.

1171
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:12,634
- You made a great film.
- For a bunch of gangsters.

1172
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:15,911
You humiliated me. I've lost Candy.
I got thrown out of college.

1173
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:21,030
Bags, who cares about college?
We made a movie!

1174
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:22,513
You don't know how lucky you are.

1175
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:25,438
You were born with talent.
I'd kill for an ounce of it.

1176
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:28,955
Listen, Baggy, I've been thinking.

1177
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,911
We should start a new film.

1178
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:33,516
I'll get the money, from a safe place this time.

1179
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:36,711
- We'll call up Candy and...
- Stop, Joe. Just stop. Please.

1180
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:40,236
Look at me.
I'm John Bagley from Leatherhead.

1181
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:41,918
We had an excellent adventure,

1182
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:44,952
more than some people have in a whole lifetime,
but it wasn't real.

1183
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:49,435
- I'm not talented. They hated it.
- They didn't hate it.

1184
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:51,118
- Leave me alone.
- They were shocked,

1185
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:54,675
because it was a dirty movie.
But it was a great dirty movie!

1186
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:56,631
You got it right! Bags!

1187
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:14,312
She would not sink with those, huh?

1188
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:20,394
Wow!

1189
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,116
- It's The Love Storm!
- The Love Storm!

1190
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:26,034
We'd better tell Joe.

1191
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:27,354
- Go and tell Joe.
- Quick.

1192
01:13:38,440 --> 01:13:40,431
We too would like to speak with Joe,
please. Now.

1193
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:43,109
- I'm sorry?
- The bad man want Joe's Cock.

1194
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:44,673
What did you say?

1195
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,468
The bad man, OK, he want

1196
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:49,428
Joe's, Joe's Cock.

1197
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:51,789
No. No, no, no. You saying it wrong.

1198
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:53,752
Let me explain it, please.

1199
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:56,157
Your son, Joe,

1200
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:58,475
all his life, he dream of Cock.

1201
01:13:58,520 --> 01:14:00,033
He talk about it all of the time.

1202
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:03,231
- "Cock, Cock, Cock. I want Cock."
- "I have to have Cock all to myself."

1203
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:06,590
But the bad man, he want Joe's Cock.

1204
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:10,636
And he is taking Joe's Cock tonight.

1205
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:14,039
Joe! Come here!

1206
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:17,479
His mother and I, we've always had
a bad feeling about all this.

1207
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,956
- What's going on?
- For you.

1208
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:27,437
Best film nomination: The Love Storm.

1209
01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:30,029
Directed by Doug Perry.
Produced by Michael De Vere.

1210
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:33,476
- He's a bastard.
- More of this stuff, Joe? Why?

1211
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:36,034
Look, Dad, listen, it's fine. I'll bin it. Don't worry.

1212
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:40,756
No. Hold on, hold on. I mean,
much as I keenly disapprove of what you did,

1213
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:44,156
I have to admit that your film did have a certain...

1214
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:50,316
Yeah, it did, didn't it?

1215
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:52,715
Now, you know I'm not a fan
of this kind of thing,

1216
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:55,832
but it seems to me, you have to get up
to London and reclaim your film.

1217
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:59,160
Here. Take the Mondeo.

1218
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:06,074
Guys, I'm going to need you. OK?

1219
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:09,234
Thank you.

1220
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:18,276
Lila, I really need your help.

1221
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:20,709
Do you know what? Forget that.
Baggy needs your help.

1222
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:24,389
- I've told you already. I'm not interested.
- He say that you would said this.

1223
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:28,877
And he said he have a special message for
you that it is all set and he have this big plan.

1224
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:30,831
Yeah, yeah. I love his big plans.

1225
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:32,199
Love his big plans.

1226
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:34,151
We can have the Cock. Mr Baggy!

1227
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:37,111
- Baggy!
- Baggy!

1228
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:55,758
It's great to see you. All right?
We'll speak soon. Personally, I love the jacket.

1229
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:08,473
Amazing.

1230
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:10,950
- Hi, Joe.
- You look fantastic.

1231
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,877
Where's Baggy? Why isn't he here yet?

1232
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:14,433
- Joe! Joe!
- Lila.

1233
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:15,879
Lila!

1234
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:17,831
He not make it.

1235
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:19,950
I'm sorry, Lila, but we fail.

1236
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:22,433
Baggy, he say, no.

1237
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:24,277
He not want Joe's Cock.

1238
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:27,392
You don't understand, Vlad.
This is for him. We're here for him.

1239
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:30,238
It's my fault, all of this.

1240
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:32,669
I'm going to make it right.

1241
01:16:32,720 --> 01:16:34,233
Right now.

1242
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:37,158
Candy! Candy! Candy!

1243
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:40,316
- Hey.
- What do you want?

1244
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:42,476
- Leave me alone.
- Please, hear me out.

1245
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:45,034
I'm sorry for what happened.
I shouldn't have lied to you.

1246
01:16:45,080 --> 01:16:48,277
Well, if you're here to pick up an award,
you're out of luck.

1247
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:49,753
Looks like you got screwed, too.

1248
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:53,270
I don't care about the awards, Candy.
I'm here because of Baggy.

1249
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:56,392
I had to let you know.
He didn't know anything about Doug Perry.

1250
01:16:57,120 --> 01:17:02,319
I lied to him too. I'm not asking you to forgive me,
but you have to forgive him.

1251
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:06,676
Look, I was an idiot for getting involved
with you guys in the first place.

1252
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:09,837
You're just kids. We're from different worlds.

1253
01:17:14,280 --> 01:17:15,838
Ladies and gentlemen,

1254
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:19,429
welcome to the Fifteenth annual
Golden Cockerel Awards.

1255
01:17:19,480 --> 01:17:24,315
The ultimate recognition of achievement
in adult-oriented entertainment.

1256
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:27,796
So, please take your seats
and I'd watch where you sit,

1257
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:31,389
as we honour
this year's outstanding individuals.

1258
01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:39,712
So, saw The Love Storm.
Got to say, I loved it, very impressed.

1259
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:42,718
Watched it beginning to end. I'm a little sore.

1260
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:45,593
Yeah, well, it's a porno.
It's not proper filmmaking.

1261
01:17:45,640 --> 01:17:48,916
You made a great film.
What's wrong with getting your start in erotica?

1262
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:50,871
My customers think it's a masterpiece.

1263
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:55,032
I'm serious. They love it. Can't get enough.

1264
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:58,277
The story, the characters,
the classic denouement

1265
01:17:58,320 --> 01:18:01,153
and there are some very good dirty bits.

1266
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:04,318
You know what they say,
sex is only dirty if you're doing it right.

1267
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:20,000
Presenting our Best Film Award this evening,

1268
01:18:20,040 --> 01:18:23,794

the divine, the delightful,

1269
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:26,718
the delicious Miss Candy Fiveways!

1270
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:36,953
Thank you, everyone,
and thank you for coming.

1271
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,468
It's an honour to be here with you tonight.

1272
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:43,037

There's Something Up Mary.

1275
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:53,391
Ram Raiders Of The Lost Park.

1276
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:56,439
And...

1277
01:18:56,480 --> 01:18:57,754
The Love Storm.

1278
01:18:57,800 --> 01:18:59,358
Yes.

1279
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:01,399
Yes!

1280
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:03,552
And the winner is...

1281
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:12,716
- The Love Storm.

1282
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:14,909
Yes!

1283
01:19:33,080 --> 01:19:36,311
Produced by Joe Clarke
and directed by John Bagley.

1284
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:56,714
Congratulations to the real team
behind The Love Storm!

1285
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:09,438
Thank you, everyone.

1286
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:11,553
Thank you.

1287
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:17,074
This is a...

1288
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:18,917
This is a fantastic award.

1289
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:20,109
It's a really...

1290
01:20:20,160 --> 01:20:22,355
It's a really chunky prize.

1291
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:23,719
But...

1292
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:27,833
It belongs to someone who can't be
with us tonight, unfortunately.

1293
01:20:27,880 --> 01:20:30,838
But, nevertheless,
this stands as real, concrete,

1294
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:33,474
undeniable proof
of the talent behind the camera.

1295
01:20:33,880 --> 01:20:35,279
And that's a guy...

1296
01:20:38,920 --> 01:20:40,558
And that's a guy called John Bagley.

1297
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:44,991
Please, you're embarrassing me.

1298
01:20:45,320 --> 01:20:48,995
Sorry I couldn't be here in person
to accept this award, but, thank you.

1299
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:52,993
Making this film has been
an unbelievable experience.

1300
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:55,918
I've learnt so much.
I've seen some amazing things.

1301
01:20:55,960 --> 01:20:58,599
One horrific thing,
but I won't go into that now.

1302
01:20:58,640 --> 01:21:01,200
Thank goodness for Wet Wipes.
That's all I'm going to say.

1303
01:21:01,240 --> 01:21:06,030
I'd like to thank the cast and crew
and most of all, my best mate, Joe Clarke,

1304
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:08,389
for making me do shit I don't want to do.

1305
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:11,273
God bless erotica!

1306
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:13,311
# The first time I saw her

1307
01:22:14,280 --> 01:22:16,555
# I wanted more than just to hold her

1308
01:22:17,240 --> 01:22:19,834
# I wanted to bend her and fold her

1309
01:22:19,880 --> 01:22:22,838
# So I leant over and I told her

1310
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:25,553
# Got myself a brand-new girlfriend

1311

# We wanna be, lapsed Catholic

1315
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:39,917
# Got the contraception,
haven't got the knack yet

1316
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:42,713
# We've tried it a variety of ways

1317
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:45,519
# I've not slept in about four days

1318

# So, we went to the cinema

1327
01:23:17,480 --> 01:23:19,072
# We came home from the cinema

1328
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:21,952
# We went through the front door

1329
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:24,033
# Up the stairs

1330
