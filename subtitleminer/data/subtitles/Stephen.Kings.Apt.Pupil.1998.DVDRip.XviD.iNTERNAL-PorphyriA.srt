00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:47,214
Still the questions remain:

2
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:52,260
Was it economic,
was it social, or was it cultural?

3
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:55,430
Or was it simply a matter of human nature?

4
00:00:55,597 --> 00:01:00,185
Why did some people do something
and others nothing at all?

5
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:03,105
Good job, Mr. Bowden.

6
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:07,818
It's nice to see a few more A's this time around.
Including Mr. Bowden's, of course.

7
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:18,829
This concludes
our week on the Holocaust.

8
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:28,380
If you want to know more, the
library is an excellent resource.

9
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:40,340
Becky Trask likes you.

10
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:47,305
- You know who I'm talking about?
- I know who she is.

11
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:52,936
- I'll think about it.
- No, just do it.

12
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:59,025
- Could you give me your trig notes?
- I knew you'd want something.

13
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:03,572
- I'll bring them in tomorrow.
- Ask Becky out.

14
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:07,325
- What are you doing after school?
- I'm busy.

15
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:47,801
All right, I'm coming.

16
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:52,264
For God's sake.

17
00:07:57,769 --> 00:08:01,022
Yes?

18
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:06,653
What do you want?

19
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:13,285
- Are you selling something?
- I have your newspaper.

20
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:22,043
- I'm not selling anything.
- Then what do you want?

21
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:27,299
- I just want to talk.
- Talk?

22
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:31,470
I don't have anything
to say to you. Good day.

23
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:35,932
Bergen-Belsen, January '43-June '43.

24
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:39,853
Auschwitz, June '43-June '44.

25
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:45,192
Then you went to Patin.
After that, you disappeared.

26
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:50,238
But in 1 965
you were spotted in West Berlin.

27
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:56,870
Listen, boy,
I don't have time for this game.

28
00:08:57,079 --> 00:09:01,249
- Leave before I call the police.
- Call them.

29
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:05,754
I'm sure they'd love to meet you.

30
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:13,053
- Who are you?
- My name is Todd Bowden.

31
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:18,183
I really want to talk to you.
Could you let me in for a minute?

32
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:22,312
Please, Mr. Dussander.

33
00:09:26,108 --> 00:09:30,278
All of this because you saw
an old man in a raincoat?

34
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:34,616
It wasn't that easy.
These pictures are 40 years old.

35
00:09:34,825 --> 00:09:37,786
But they looked like those I took.

36
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:44,334
- You took photographs of me?
- Yeah, but even then I wasn't sure.

37
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:48,964
I needed real proof. So I dusted
your mail box for fingerprints.

38
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:55,971
That's harder than people think.
You need a lot of stuff.

39
00:09:56,179 --> 00:10:01,768
- You were at the movies.
- You dusted my mail box.

40
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:05,772
You took photographs of me.
What else did you do?

41
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:10,485
I had a copy of your fingerprints
from your lsraeli wanted sheet.

42
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:14,072
It's all on database
at the university.

43
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:20,328
Are you okay?

44
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:27,002
- Would you care for a drink?
- How about milk?

45
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:42,517
- Have you told your parents?
- Do you think I'm crazy?

46
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:48,690
It takes eight "compares"
to get a print accepted in court.

47
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:53,361
One or two is not hard to find,
but eight, that's really tough.

48
00:10:53,528 --> 00:11:00,827
It all sounds very exciting, but
all your work has been for nothing.

49
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:04,372
I found 14 compares.

50
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:14,633
Boy, what you have done ...
I have to explain this to you.

51
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,930
- What you have done is a violation.
- Like decompression experiments?

52
00:11:20,097 --> 00:11:25,519
- That's a violation.
- I'm calling the police.

53
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:29,439
Your father's going
to beat your behind.

54
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:34,736
- He doesn't believe in violence.
- They should start.

55
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:47,874
My name is Denker.

56
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:53,547
Arthur Denker.

57
00:11:55,006 --> 00:12:01,096
I'm an American.
I became a citizen in 1955.

58
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:08,228
I vote.

59
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:16,111
You've no right to come here
and say these lies about me.

60
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:23,326
I have your fingerprints.
I have your photographs.

61
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:28,623
One way or another,
I'll get them to the right people.

62
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:37,799
This is unbelievable.

63
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:44,848
What do you want? Tell me.

64
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:50,687
- I want to hear about it.
- Hear about what?

65
00:12:50,854 --> 00:12:54,775
The stories. Everything.

66
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:58,570
What everything?

67
00:12:58,737 --> 00:13:03,033
Everything they're afraid
to show us in school.

68
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,953
You were there.
You did those things.

69
00:13:07,204 --> 00:13:12,334
No one can tell it better than you.
That's all I want.

70
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:18,006
Then I'll leave you alone.
And just so you know ...

71
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:23,136
Everything that I have on you, -

72
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:27,432
- the compares, the wanted sheet,
all the photographs, -

73
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:33,063
- are in a safe place. If anything
happens to me, they'll be found.

74
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:41,238
Why should I consider doing this?

75
00:13:41,947 --> 00:13:46,410
Because you hung up the phone.

76
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:11,268
Judging by the results
of your first exam, -

77
00:14:11,435 --> 00:14:15,981
- for most of you, we moved
too fast through chapter one.

78
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:23,238
How many of you
think you know what sociology is?

79
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:32,622
As I thought.
All right, turn to chapter two.

80
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:44,217
Once they were in the chamber,
how long did it take? A minute?

81
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:50,056
No, the Prussic acid
took about 15 minutes.

82
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:55,979
But the monoxide could take
an hour, sometimes more.

83
00:14:56,730 --> 00:15:01,610
What happened to them ... exactly?

84
00:15:04,446 --> 00:15:09,493
It was a mess. They would
lose control of their bodies.

85
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:15,040
They vomited, urinated
and defecated themselves.

86
00:15:15,207 --> 00:15:19,628
Even though the gas
came through vents in the ceiling, -

87
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:22,464
- they climbed up on each other, -

88
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:27,636
- desperately reaching for fresh air
that wasn't there.

89
00:15:27,803 --> 00:15:34,810
- There was a mountain of bodies.
- What about the children?

90
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:40,440
On the bottom.

91
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:47,489
Did anyone ever survive it?

92
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:56,832
One time, the gas didn't work.

93
00:15:56,998 --> 00:16:03,338
There was a leak in the pipes,
so oxygen mixed with the monoxide.

94
00:16:04,256 --> 00:16:10,178
It was horrible. After an hour,
they were still moving.

95
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:16,810
Stumbling around the room
like drunks, their eyes glassy.

96
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:20,313
What did you do?

97
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,651
I ordered more gas,
but we didn't know about the leak.

98
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:30,449
Soon they began to twitch all over,
like they were dancing.

99
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:37,539
Some fell to their knees,
laughing in a high-pitched scream.

100
00:16:38,457 --> 00:16:42,586
Even the guards were frightened.

101
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:51,803
They didn't die. After two hours,
I sent five men in with rifles.

102
00:16:57,225 --> 00:17:01,438
It's getting dark.
Your mother will be worried.

103
00:17:01,605 --> 00:17:06,735
Shit! I've got to go. Tomorrow,
I want to hear the end of this.

104
00:17:06,902 --> 00:17:10,155
The end?

105
00:17:12,908 --> 00:17:16,411
The end.

106
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:17,347
Todd, are you up?
Let's go. Joey's outside.

107
00:18:17,514 --> 00:18:23,937
- Tell him I'm coming.
- I woke you half an hour ago.

108
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:29,067
- Todd?
- I must have fallen asleep.

109
00:18:29,234 --> 00:18:34,781
I'm going to see a client tonight.
There's some chicken in the fridge.

110
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:41,538
- I'm eating at Mr. Denker's house.
- And do what, watch TV?

111
00:18:41,705 --> 00:18:46,752
I read books to him.
Don't worry about it.

112
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:54,176
Invite him over here.
Daddy and I still want to meet him.

113
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:56,636
The policeman said:

114
00:18:56,845 --> 00:19:01,975
"Mr. Denker, if you can't see
the road, you shouldn't be driving.

115
00:19:02,184 --> 00:19:05,020
"How many fingers am I holding up?

116
00:19:05,187 --> 00:19:09,649
I said,
"Well now, officer, let me guess."

117
00:19:10,442 --> 00:19:13,612
"One?"

118
00:19:15,489 --> 00:19:20,452
That was the end of my driving
in America. I take the bus.

119
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:27,918
I'm now in a wheelchair, but
my sight is not what it used to be.

120
00:19:30,253 --> 00:19:34,091
That's a white-tailed buck.

121
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:40,555
- We used to live in Carolina.
- Dick shot that seven years ago.

122
00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:45,393
Your grandson never told me
he came from a family of hunters.

123
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:50,357
- Todd never took a shine to guns.
- No, he's good at other things.

124
00:19:50,524 --> 00:19:55,570
- Baseball is Todd's game.
- Arthur, you want a cigar?

125
00:19:55,779 --> 00:20:00,659
I'll have one of my cigarettes.
Where are they?

126
00:20:00,826 --> 00:20:04,496
Let me help you with that.

127
00:20:04,663 --> 00:20:11,753
Your generosity humbles me.
Thank you for an enchanting evening.

128
00:20:16,133 --> 00:20:21,805
Arthur, can I ask you
a personal question?

129
00:20:22,681 --> 00:20:26,435
What did you do during the war?

130
00:20:30,313 --> 00:20:34,317
I was in the reserves,
as were most young men, Victor.

131
00:20:34,484 --> 00:20:38,697
My poor eyesight
kept me out of combat, thank God.

132
00:20:38,864 --> 00:20:45,996
I spent most of the war
washing hospital linen.

133
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,253
You're quiet tonight.

134
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:57,340
I'm sorry, it's just that
I've heard all these stories before.

135
00:20:57,549 --> 00:21:03,138
- Todd!
- The boy's just being honest.

136
00:21:04,681 --> 00:21:09,478
That's a privilege that men
must sometimes give up.

137
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:15,484
That reminds me ...

138
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:23,075
It must have been my first year
at the university ...

139
00:21:23,241 --> 00:21:28,455
My men took turns shooting them,
but there were so many.

140
00:21:28,622 --> 00:21:35,670
Three bodies were packed into each
oven. They were ground into ash.

141
00:21:35,837 --> 00:21:41,176
A whole town was
wiped off the face of the earth.

142
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:58,693
Still it wasn't enough for Himmler.
It was a dark year.

143
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:03,657
He ordered every Jew in Kiev
to come to the Babi Jar ravine.

144
00:22:03,907 --> 00:22:08,870
Remember, the 20's
were a desperate time in Germany.

145
00:22:09,037 --> 00:22:13,542
The Treaty of Versailles
had left us crippled.

146
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:17,587
They would hide.

147
00:22:17,754 --> 00:22:22,884
We always found them. If the dogs
didn't, smoke and fire would.

148
00:22:23,093 --> 00:22:27,389
We would round them up
and march them out to a large pit.

149
00:22:27,556 --> 00:22:31,393
At the time, the shooting
was no longer killing.

150
00:22:31,601 --> 00:22:34,896
Killing was no longer death.

151
00:22:35,105 --> 00:22:39,568
I will never forget
the sound that night.

152
00:22:39,734 --> 00:22:43,739
So many of them
on top of each another like that.

153
00:22:43,905 --> 00:22:49,035
After a few hours,
they began to settle.

154
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:56,001
A head would fall.

155
00:22:56,209 --> 00:22:59,463
An arm would drop.

156
00:23:03,008 --> 00:23:07,888
It was a bit like the sound
of blowing leaves.

157
00:23:10,223 --> 00:23:13,101
What did it feel like?

158
00:23:26,531 --> 00:23:29,326
It had to be done.

159
00:23:29,493 --> 00:23:35,665
A door had been opened and
couldn't be shut. It was the end ...

160
00:23:35,832 --> 00:23:38,960
You don't understand.

161
00:23:40,545 --> 00:23:43,507
You've done it a million times.
Let's go!

162
00:24:04,444 --> 00:24:07,364
All right, that's it. Take a shower.

163
00:24:08,865 --> 00:24:12,285
- Where have you been?
- What do you mean?

164
00:24:12,536 --> 00:24:17,749
I tried to phone you.
There's a party on Saturday night.

165
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:22,504
- I've been busy.
- Too busy for your best friend?

166
00:24:22,712 --> 00:24:28,969
- I've been studying a lot.
- Are you going to go?

167
00:24:29,177 --> 00:24:35,434
- I don't know if I can get the car.
- I know someone who'll drive you.

168
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:30,173
I've been accepted!

169
00:26:30,382 --> 00:26:34,302
The Ritzy Vista Country Club.
My life 's ambition.

170
00:26:34,511 --> 00:26:41,101
Officer, can you tell me which bus
goes to the Ritzy Vista Club?

171
00:26:41,351 --> 00:26:44,229
Here it is.

172
00:26:44,396 --> 00:26:50,736
- Do you go by the country club?
- Very humorous.

173
00:27:13,383 --> 00:27:17,429
- Wake up.
- I'll kill you!

174
00:27:21,683 --> 00:27:24,603
I thought you were dead.

175
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:30,942
It's Saturday. Since when do you
come here on Saturdays?

176
00:27:31,151 --> 00:27:35,572
I brought you something.
Aren't you going to open it?

177
00:27:36,406 --> 00:27:40,577
Wait.
Let me pull the shades down.

178
00:27:42,287 --> 00:27:45,582
- What for?
- To be safe.

179
00:27:45,749 --> 00:27:51,922
- The hell with this. You open it.
- Relax. Open it.

180
00:28:02,265 --> 00:28:06,436
You wrapped it yourself, I see.

181
00:28:21,743 --> 00:28:25,914
- Merry Christmas.
- Mary mother of God!

182
00:28:27,457 --> 00:28:32,504
- Where did you get this?
- It's pretty real.

183
00:28:37,551 --> 00:28:45,183
"E.F. Montgomery Costumes,
Tappan Zee, New Jersey."

184
00:28:46,435 --> 00:28:51,231
- Try it on.
- Have you lost your mind?

185
00:28:51,481 --> 00:28:55,944
- Why would I put that on?
- I thought you would like it.

186
00:28:57,404 --> 00:29:01,158
Like it?
You're a bigger fool than I thought.

187
00:29:01,366 --> 00:29:05,996
Maybe I'll put it on
and do a little shopping, right?

188
00:29:06,163 --> 00:29:09,499
For this indignity,
I should smash you.

189
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:14,880
This is nothing compared to what
the lsraelis would do to you.

190
00:29:15,088 --> 00:29:20,385
Don't forget that and don't ever
forget the file I have on you.

191
00:29:20,552 --> 00:29:24,890
I tried to do things the nice way,
but fine, we'll do it the hard way.

192
00:29:25,056 --> 00:29:29,936
You'll put this on because
I want to see you in it. Move!

193
00:30:14,064 --> 00:30:18,527
- I see I've been promoted.
- Yeah, it's all they had.

194
00:30:18,693 --> 00:30:21,530
But it's a perfect fit.

195
00:30:21,822 --> 00:30:26,952
- It itches like hell.
- Quiet.

196
00:30:28,245 --> 00:30:32,791
- Put the hat on.
- Please!

197
00:30:32,958 --> 00:30:36,711
Please, put the hat on.

198
00:31:04,281 --> 00:31:07,701
Attention.

199
00:31:15,792 --> 00:31:19,087
What's so funny?

200
00:31:20,088 --> 00:31:24,009
March. Do it.

201
00:31:25,635 --> 00:31:29,139
I'm serious.

202
00:31:35,812 --> 00:31:39,816
Stop fucking around. March!

203
00:31:44,196 --> 00:31:47,574
That's it. March.

204
00:31:49,493 --> 00:31:53,246
Face right.

205
00:31:55,207 --> 00:31:57,584
March.

206
00:31:57,751 --> 00:32:01,129
Face right.

207
00:32:01,296 --> 00:32:04,674
March.

208
00:32:04,841 --> 00:32:08,970
Face right.
March.

209
00:32:13,725 --> 00:32:18,772
Face right. March!

210
00:32:19,022 --> 00:32:21,233
March!

211
00:32:32,869 --> 00:32:36,623
That's enough. Stop.

212
00:32:42,295 --> 00:32:45,882
Stop it!

213
00:33:08,947 --> 00:33:15,036
Boy, be careful. You play with fire.

214
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:29,551
Okay,
I can tell you're not into this.

215
00:33:29,718 --> 00:33:34,055
No, I am. Really.
It just takes me a while.

216
00:33:34,931 --> 00:33:40,145
I like you. You're the only guy
who never tried to impress me.

217
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:49,154
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

218
00:33:50,739 --> 00:33:55,702
Do you ever wonder
why people do the things they do?

219
00:33:55,952 --> 00:34:01,249
Think about it. Seriously.

220
00:34:08,799 --> 00:34:13,762
It's better not to think.
It's better to just do it.

221
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:40,205
Who are you, kitty?

222
00:34:49,714 --> 00:34:54,052
It's getting cold out here, kitty.

223
00:35:11,653 --> 00:35:15,574
- I'm sorry.
- We can try again later.

224
00:35:15,782 --> 00:35:22,205
- That's never happened before.
- It's all right.

225
00:35:23,874 --> 00:35:28,503
Could you blow that
the other way, please.

226
00:35:31,548 --> 00:35:36,887
- Maybe you just don't like me.
- No, it's not that at all.

227
00:35:37,053 --> 00:35:42,684
- I really do.
- Maybe you just don't like girls.

228
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:12,047
Kitty ...

229
00:36:12,756 --> 00:36:15,425
Goodbye.

230
00:36:25,227 --> 00:36:28,730
You motherfucker!

231
00:37:02,931 --> 00:37:07,894
You have five more minutes.

232
00:37:37,507 --> 00:37:39,634
"Dear Mr. & Mrs. Bowden."

233
00:37:39,843 --> 00:37:44,598
"l suggest we have a conference
about Todd's first-semester grades."

234
00:37:44,765 --> 00:37:48,977
"ln light of his previous
outstanding work, -

235
00:37:49,144 --> 00:37:54,357
- it suggests a problem which
should be addressed immediately."

236
00:37:54,524 --> 00:37:59,321
"Let's work out a time to meet.
Sincerely yours, Edward French."

237
00:38:00,947 --> 00:38:05,035
- What are you going to do?
- I'm fucked if I know.

238
00:38:05,202 --> 00:38:09,372
- What?
- I said, fucked if I know.

239
00:38:09,539 --> 00:38:16,254
- You're throwing it up hard.
- I don't need a lesson.

240
00:38:17,923 --> 00:38:23,136
I'm a fuck-up. My dad expects this
kind of thing from me, but you ..?

241
00:38:28,308 --> 00:38:34,022
- You're talking to yourself.
- I fucked up. I'll fix it.

242
00:38:35,065 --> 00:38:38,151
Whatever you say.

243
00:38:38,318 --> 00:38:43,532
What's with you and Becky?
Becky Trask, idiot.

244
00:38:44,241 --> 00:38:47,828
What did you call me?

245
00:38:49,621 --> 00:38:55,168
You're being a real dick, man.
I've got to get to practice.

246
00:39:00,048 --> 00:39:02,509
"Talking to yourself?"

247
00:39:03,718 --> 00:39:07,222
"You're being a dick."

248
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:36,895
"Let's work out a time to meet."

249
00:40:37,062 --> 00:40:40,732
"Sincerely yours, Edward French."

250
00:40:40,982 --> 00:40:44,903
Who's this Edward French?
Headmaster?

251
00:40:45,695 --> 00:40:49,282
- Guidance counsellor.
- What is that?

252
00:40:49,491 --> 00:40:53,870
He guides and he counsels.
You read the letter.

253
00:40:55,872 --> 00:40:58,250
What stinks in here?

254
00:40:58,417 --> 00:41:03,463
I bet it's my TV dinner.

255
00:41:05,882 --> 00:41:08,510
We've got a real problem here.

256
00:41:08,677 --> 00:41:12,681
- I'm not the one in trouble.
- We'll see about that.

257
00:41:12,889 --> 00:41:17,602
Don't turn this on me. It's not
my fault your grades have fallen.

258
00:41:17,769 --> 00:41:21,523
You're wrong. The shit you're
telling me keeps me up all night.

259
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:26,361
I fall asleep during class.

260
00:41:28,071 --> 00:41:32,534
I need a fucking pencil.
Do you have one?

261
00:41:32,701 --> 00:41:37,998
- What will your parents do?
- They won't ever see the letter.

262
00:41:38,165 --> 00:41:44,004
This isn't just a little slip-up.
My parents will freak.

263
00:41:44,171 --> 00:41:50,343
They'll want to know exactly
what happened. Do you get it?

264
00:41:53,054 --> 00:41:56,558
- I think so.
- You'd better be sure.

265
00:41:56,767 --> 00:42:01,104
It'll be your ass that winds up
in jail, not mine. I need a pencil.

266
00:42:01,271 --> 00:42:05,275
A sharp one, please. Thank you.

267
00:42:05,442 --> 00:42:10,405
Does this Edward French
know your parents socially?

268
00:42:10,614 --> 00:42:13,617
They wouldn't mix with that geek.

269
00:42:13,784 --> 00:42:18,080
And professionally,
has he ever spoken to them?

270
00:42:18,288 --> 00:42:22,584
No, I've never needed it till now.

271
00:42:25,962 --> 00:42:31,510
- Don't mess up that carbon paper.
- What would you know about it?

272
00:42:31,676 --> 00:42:36,223
I was forging documents
before your parents were born.

273
00:42:54,658 --> 00:42:57,619
- Todd.
- Do you know what this is about?

274
00:42:57,786 --> 00:43:01,456
I'm sorry, I don't.

275
00:43:08,463 --> 00:43:12,717
That's my son,
he's always chewing gum.

276
00:43:12,884 --> 00:43:16,096
He means the world to me.

277
00:43:16,263 --> 00:43:20,934
- Todd, have a seat.
- Hello there.

278
00:43:22,602 --> 00:43:25,981
It's okay, sit down.

279
00:43:29,192 --> 00:43:34,823
We've talked about what's been going
on. Do you want to talk about it?

280
00:43:37,492 --> 00:43:42,038
- Not really.
- Don't be embarrassed.

281
00:43:42,205 --> 00:43:46,585
It's not your fault. We both want
to help you get back on track.

282
00:43:46,752 --> 00:43:49,921
Both of you?

283
00:43:50,088 --> 00:43:56,678
I must admit that the situation
in Richard's home is appalling.

284
00:43:56,887 --> 00:44:01,683
I always believed a man should
take responsibility for his family.

285
00:44:01,892 --> 00:44:07,814
When you came to me in tears
and asked me to intervene, -

286
00:44:07,981 --> 00:44:12,778
- then I realised this was not
a matter to be trifled with.

287
00:44:12,944 --> 00:44:17,199
That's why I arranged this meeting.

288
00:44:17,365 --> 00:44:19,576
We appreciate your concern.

289
00:44:20,744 --> 00:44:27,167
Todd, I've seen your record,
and every grade is way down.

290
00:44:27,417 --> 00:44:33,298
Even your strongest subject,
history, is down from A to C-.

291
00:44:33,465 --> 00:44:37,469
Trigonometry down to a D.

292
00:44:37,636 --> 00:44:43,517
Did you know you were on your way
to finishing first in your class?

293
00:44:45,602 --> 00:44:49,189
Your grandfather and I
have been talking.

294
00:44:49,356 --> 00:44:55,695
With your father's work problems
and your mom ... drinking, -

295
00:44:55,862 --> 00:44:59,533
- maybe home
isn't the best place to be studying.

296
00:44:59,825 --> 00:45:04,121
He's offered to let you study
over at his place after school.

297
00:45:04,287 --> 00:45:08,625
- I think it's a good idea.
- You do?

298
00:45:08,792 --> 00:45:14,423
I've offered to go a step further,
but it means we have to make a deal.

299
00:45:15,465 --> 00:45:17,426
A deal?

300
00:45:17,634 --> 00:45:22,431
Finals for this quarter
are in 3 1/2 weeks.

301
00:45:22,639 --> 00:45:25,100
If you can give me all A's, -

302
00:45:25,267 --> 00:45:30,230
- I'll talk to your teachers
and we'll discount your mid-terms, -

303
00:45:30,397 --> 00:45:37,154
- and let this quarter rest with the
final exams. B's and C's won't help.

304
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:41,950
But all A's will show everybody
that you're serious.

305
00:45:42,159 --> 00:45:46,663
- You can do that?
- Yeah.

306
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:51,585
But first you've got to start
being honest with me.

307
00:45:52,878 --> 00:45:58,633
No more forging your father's
signature on my letters.

308
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:04,139
This is between the three of us,
if it makes things easier at home.

309
00:46:04,306 --> 00:46:10,729
But if you try to trick me again, I
show up at your door. Is that clear?

310
00:46:12,022 --> 00:46:17,319
- He's offering to help.
- That's a lot to do in three weeks.

311
00:46:17,527 --> 00:46:24,409
- What if I can't do it?
- Mr. Bowden, I must thank you.

312
00:46:24,576 --> 00:46:28,789
If it's all right with you,
I'd like to talk to Todd alone.

313
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:34,294
It's quite all right.

314
00:46:34,461 --> 00:46:39,424
If you didn't excuse me,
my desire for a cigarette would.

315
00:46:43,929 --> 00:46:49,601
When the time is right,
I'll tell Richard about all this.

316
00:46:49,768 --> 00:46:54,815
He and Monica need to know
what's happening to their son.

317
00:47:00,070 --> 00:47:03,657
I'll expect you after school.

318
00:47:16,461 --> 00:47:21,675
- He's a very persuasive man.
- Tell me about it.

319
00:47:22,551 --> 00:47:27,764
Listen, Todd, I understand
what you're going through.

320
00:47:27,931 --> 00:47:32,561
My wife and I just went through
the nastiest divorce.

321
00:47:32,769 --> 00:47:39,025
I know it's not easy
being a senior and only 1 6.

322
00:47:39,234 --> 00:47:44,614
Your grandfather thinks you can
do this, and I know you can.

323
00:47:44,781 --> 00:47:49,828
I don't want you to feel
like you have no one to talk to.

324
00:47:50,036 --> 00:47:54,583
Your parents, or girl problems ...

325
00:47:54,750 --> 00:48:02,549
Here's my home phone.
Anything at all, you call me.

326
00:48:03,133 --> 00:48:07,929
Call me. Deal?

327
00:48:08,138 --> 00:48:12,184
I'm telling you, if you
get past this little hurdle, -

328
00:48:12,350 --> 00:48:16,938
- the world's going to open up
for you like you won't believe.

329
00:48:27,282 --> 00:48:29,951
Bye.

330
00:48:48,762 --> 00:48:52,349
Have you lost your mind? Grandpa!

331
00:48:52,557 --> 00:48:58,146
- What are you so excited about?
- You've got some balls!

332
00:48:58,355 --> 00:49:03,819
- You played it beautifully.
- I could've busted you right there.

333
00:49:03,985 --> 00:49:09,449
Yes, you could have, but did not.
Why was that?

334
00:49:11,827 --> 00:49:16,373
Your Edward French
won't give you any more trouble.

335
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:21,586
Now you are upset
because you have to work.

336
00:49:21,753 --> 00:49:25,507
You have him thinking I can
do something that can't be done.

337
00:49:25,715 --> 00:49:31,680
It can and it will. You simply
have to work. No more stories.

338
00:49:31,888 --> 00:49:35,559
- Stop screwing around.
- I don't take orders from you.

339
00:49:35,726 --> 00:49:40,689
- You do now.
- I can just pick up the phone.

340
00:49:40,856 --> 00:49:43,900
And do what?

341
00:49:46,278 --> 00:49:53,744
Do you think I would let you turn me
in without dragging you with me?

342
00:49:53,910 --> 00:49:58,457
Your self-confidence is so bloated
you've lost touch with reality.

343
00:49:58,623 --> 00:50:04,504
90,000 died in Patin.
To the whole world I am a monster.

344
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:09,468
And you have known about me
all this time.

345
00:50:09,634 --> 00:50:13,638
If I am caught, when the reporters
sick their microphones in my face, -

346
00:50:13,805 --> 00:50:19,686
- it will be your name that
I repeat. Todd Bowden.

347
00:50:19,853 --> 00:50:25,901
Todd Bowden. Yes, that was his name.
For almost a year he has known.

348
00:50:26,068 --> 00:50:33,617
He wanted to know everything.
That was how he put it. Everything.

349
00:50:35,786 --> 00:50:41,500
- They'll never believe you.
- It doesn't matter.

350
00:50:41,666 --> 00:50:45,796
You're going to be infamous, boy.

351
00:50:45,962 --> 00:50:51,510
Do you know what such a scandal
can do? It never goes away.

352
00:50:51,676 --> 00:50:54,971
Not for you. Not for your parents.

353
00:50:55,138 --> 00:50:59,434
Lying to judges and reporters
isn't as easy as you think.

354
00:50:59,601 --> 00:51:04,106
You'd have to be brilliant.
Can you do that? I know I can.

355
00:51:05,649 --> 00:51:11,530
There's no way I can pull out of
a six-month slide in a few weeks.

356
00:51:11,696 --> 00:51:16,493
- That shit just doesn't happen.
- The time for discussion is over.

357
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:22,749
You will work for the rest of this
quarter and all of your vacation.

358
00:54:00,615 --> 00:54:04,911
Hawthorne was one of the most
interesting writers of his time ...

359
00:54:20,594 --> 00:54:24,514
Why did some people do something
and others nothing at all?

360
00:54:24,723 --> 00:54:30,145
This concludes
our week on the Holocaust.

361
00:54:31,396 --> 00:54:35,817
You are a monster.

362
00:54:35,984 --> 00:54:40,947
- What you have done is a violation.
- I wanted to know more.

363
00:54:41,907 --> 00:54:45,494
A door had been opened ...

364
00:54:46,369 --> 00:54:50,624
- I fucked up.
- Lying isn't as easy as you think.

365
00:54:57,047 --> 00:55:00,467
Be careful. You play with fire.

366
00:55:27,744 --> 00:55:31,039
It never goes away.

367
00:55:31,206 --> 00:55:34,584
Not for you.

368
00:56:26,553 --> 00:56:32,100
- How about some melba toast?
- Sure.

369
00:56:47,449 --> 00:56:54,456
I'd have expected you to backflip
down the hall after such good news.

370
00:56:55,832 --> 00:56:59,961
But you're so quiet.

371
00:57:01,755 --> 00:57:06,968
Today I think I will give you
the day off from studying.

372
00:57:07,177 --> 00:57:10,764
How's that?

373
00:57:11,765 --> 00:57:17,938
How about one of my stories instead?

374
00:57:19,481 --> 00:57:24,611
- I still have a few good ones left.
- I don't care.

375
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:31,076
I could tell you about
the special soap we made.

376
00:57:31,243 --> 00:57:35,163
There's the story
of how I escaped from Berlin -

377
00:57:35,372 --> 00:57:41,420
- after I foolishly went back.
That was a close one.

378
00:57:43,588 --> 00:57:49,136
No, none of these.
You don't seem to be in the mood.

379
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:54,015
Today, I will tell you the story -

380
00:57:54,182 --> 00:57:59,396
- of an old man who was afraid.

381
00:57:59,604 --> 00:58:02,941
He was afraid
of a certain young boy -

382
00:58:03,108 --> 00:58:07,195
- who was,
in a queer way, his friend.

383
00:58:07,404 --> 00:58:12,200
The boy proved
to be a very good student.

384
00:58:12,367 --> 00:58:16,371
But not perhaps in quite the way -

385
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:21,877
- his mother
and his teachers had envisioned.

386
00:58:23,670 --> 00:58:27,507
At first, the old man
disliked the boy intensely.

387
00:58:27,716 --> 00:58:32,387
But then he began
to enjoy the boy's company.

388
00:58:32,554 --> 00:58:37,768
Of course, there was still a
great deal of distrust between them.

389
00:58:39,102 --> 00:58:43,982
Each knew something
the other wanted to keep secret.

390
00:58:44,149 --> 00:58:47,235
Over time, the old man felt -

391
00:58:47,444 --> 00:58:50,864
- his hold on the boy slipping away.

392
00:58:51,114 --> 00:58:56,745
He thought the day might come
when the boy no longer needed him.

393
00:58:56,953 --> 00:59:04,503
So one sleepless night,
the old man got out of bed -

394
00:59:04,669 --> 00:59:08,924
- and wrote down the story
of his involvement with the boy.

395
00:59:10,884 --> 00:59:15,013
Everything he could remember.

396
00:59:16,431 --> 00:59:19,851
From the first day forward.

397
00:59:21,395 --> 00:59:26,525
He wrote how the boy forced his way
into the old man's house.

398
00:59:26,691 --> 00:59:31,738
How he blackmailed the old man to
serve his own morbid fascinations.

399
00:59:31,988 --> 00:59:35,158
When the boy's grades
began to fall, -

400
00:59:35,325 --> 00:59:40,789
- he blamed the old man and ordered
him to impersonate his grandfather.

401
00:59:40,997 --> 00:59:44,751
Even though his hands
were stinging with arthritis, -

402
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:49,131
- he felt happy
for the first time in weeks.

403
00:59:52,050 --> 00:59:55,887
He felt safe.

404
00:59:57,889 --> 01:00:02,394
The following morning,
the old man put on his best suit.

405
01:00:02,561 --> 01:00:09,401
He went to one of the local banks
and rented a safe-deposit box.

406
01:00:10,652 --> 01:00:13,655
The bank officer told him -

407
01:00:13,864 --> 01:00:20,871
- that only the old man could open
the box, with one exception:

408
01:00:22,038 --> 01:00:30,172
The exception was in the event
of the box-holder's death.

409
01:00:33,216 --> 01:00:37,929
- Then what?
- The bank would open he box.

410
01:00:38,096 --> 01:00:44,770
The lnternal Revenue Service
would inventory the contents.

411
01:00:44,936 --> 01:00:50,984
But in this case, they would
only find a 1 2-page document.

412
01:00:52,235 --> 01:00:57,032
Non-taxable, but highly interesting.

413
01:00:58,408 --> 01:01:03,371
- I don't believe you.
- My boy ...

414
01:01:03,580 --> 01:01:07,334
- It's already done.
- Look at you!

415
01:01:07,542 --> 01:01:14,716
- You could go at any time.
- Don't be so theatrical.

416
01:01:14,883 --> 01:01:18,887
A man five years older than me
worries more about his heart -

417
01:01:19,054 --> 01:01:23,141
- than being sent off to lsrael.

418
01:01:23,558 --> 01:01:27,229
And the day will come,
if I live long enough, -

419
01:01:27,396 --> 01:01:30,816
- when I decide that what you know
no longer matters.

420
01:01:30,982 --> 01:01:35,862
Then and only then,
I will destroy the document.

421
01:01:36,113 --> 01:01:40,700
So many things can happen.
Accidents, sickness ...

422
01:01:40,867 --> 01:01:44,704
- You could slip in the shower!
- Que sera sera ...

423
01:01:44,913 --> 01:01:48,166
whatever will be will be

424
01:01:48,333 --> 01:01:55,215
the future 's not ours to see
que sera sera ...

425
01:02:00,303 --> 01:02:04,141
I can see you're thinking it now.

426
01:02:04,307 --> 01:02:08,937
It's in your eyes. Killing me.

427
01:02:09,146 --> 01:02:16,069
The flick of a knife.
Push me down the steps.

428
01:02:16,236 --> 01:02:19,823
I'm old. You are strong and angry.

429
01:02:20,031 --> 01:02:26,288
Good assets for killing,
but there is something missing.

430
01:02:28,039 --> 01:02:32,836
To have someone in your control.

431
01:02:34,838 --> 01:02:39,092
To have them know
that they are alive -

432
01:02:39,259 --> 01:02:43,847
- because you have not decided
to the contrary.

433
01:02:44,973 --> 01:02:48,977
Do you have that power?
Ask yourself.

434
01:02:49,186 --> 01:02:52,606
It's not an easy question.
I think you know that.

435
01:02:59,738 --> 01:03:03,158
You know this means we're through,
don't you?

436
01:03:03,325 --> 01:03:08,121
You won't be seeing me round here
anymore.

437
01:03:08,371 --> 01:03:12,542
I suppose I won't.

438
01:03:16,922 --> 01:03:22,677
- What are you doing?
- This is the end.

439
01:03:25,389 --> 01:03:28,350
Here.

440
01:03:31,228 --> 01:03:38,360
Drink. To our lives together.
The beginning and the end.

441
01:03:46,910 --> 01:03:50,831
- I think you should fuck yourself!
- My dear boy ...

442
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:56,253
Don't you see?
We are fucking each other.

443
01:06:39,082 --> 01:06:42,335
Watch your step.

444
01:07:16,286 --> 01:07:20,457
Sir? Excuse me ...

445
01:07:26,505 --> 01:07:31,093
I could help you carry those.
Don't be afraid.

446
01:07:31,259 --> 01:07:37,265
- I don't need your help.
- I'm not a bad guy.

447
01:07:37,432 --> 01:07:42,771
- I just want ...
- What? Why do you bother me?

448
01:07:42,938 --> 01:07:47,609
We're practically neighbours.
I stay right over there most nights.

449
01:07:47,776 --> 01:07:53,073
I see you walk down the street.
I just want to help.

450
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:57,285
- It's called being neighbourly.
- Piss off.

451
01:07:57,494 --> 01:08:02,290
There's no reason to be rude.

452
01:08:04,668 --> 01:08:08,505
I know something about you.

453
01:08:10,173 --> 01:08:14,010
I know you're a nice guy.

454
01:08:14,803 --> 01:08:18,724
I'm nice, too. Just like the boy.

455
01:08:20,517 --> 01:08:22,978
I see.

456
01:08:23,145 --> 01:08:28,024
I'm not ashamed to say
that I could use a drink about now.

457
01:08:29,192 --> 01:08:32,320
But I don't take no charity.

458
01:08:32,487 --> 01:08:36,992
If you were to invite me in as
a friend, we could have a drink.

459
01:08:37,159 --> 01:08:41,538
- A drink?
- That's what I'm saying.

460
01:08:41,705 --> 01:08:47,335
- You smell like a toilet.
- Maybe I could use your shower.

461
01:08:47,502 --> 01:08:53,925
But first a drink.
Then I will do anything you say.

462
01:09:07,064 --> 01:09:12,736
I had him hooked up, rolling,
411/2 ... 3 minutes.

463
01:09:12,903 --> 01:09:17,282
That was my best time.

464
01:09:17,449 --> 01:09:25,332
I didn't see that dog
in the back seat.

465
01:09:25,499 --> 01:09:28,543
- What dog?
- I heard it barking.

466
01:09:28,710 --> 01:09:33,215
I hear dogs barking all the time,
even when they ain't there.

467
01:09:33,381 --> 01:09:38,595
I didn't pay no mind.
So the DOT didn't want to hire me.

468
01:09:38,762 --> 01:09:43,350
Anyway ...
Who wants to talk about that?

469
01:09:43,517 --> 01:09:48,814
So, I was ... an independent.

470
01:09:49,940 --> 01:09:53,235
It meant that I could go all over.

471
01:09:53,402 --> 01:09:59,658
I believe we need another bottle.

472
01:10:01,159 --> 01:10:04,913
If you're offering.

473
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:09,751
It's no trouble at all.
Why don't you take mine?

474
01:10:17,843 --> 01:10:24,182
Like I was saying,
I worked as an independent.

475
01:10:24,391 --> 01:10:28,061
The DOT, they wouldn't hire me.

476
01:10:28,228 --> 01:10:32,858
I was able
to go all over the whole city.

477
01:10:33,024 --> 01:10:39,114
- Midtown, downtown ...
- Where is my bottle opener?

478
01:10:39,322 --> 01:10:43,702
You stay right there.

479
01:10:51,251 --> 01:10:56,298
Then I moved on.
Washington Heights was always good.

480
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:06,183
The Dominicans there like ...

481
01:11:17,611 --> 01:11:22,115
Then they dropped that cinder block
on that cop and it got all crazy.

482
01:11:22,282 --> 01:11:27,329
But you've got to be moving or they
catch you hooking their ride.

483
01:11:52,229 --> 01:11:55,482
Do you mind?

484
01:11:55,649 --> 01:11:59,486
No, not at all.

485
01:12:10,163 --> 01:12:16,044
Maybe in the morning
you could let me have $1 0.

486
01:12:16,962 --> 01:12:19,965
Yeah, perhaps.

487
01:12:21,550 --> 01:12:26,221
- Maybe even 20.
- Perhaps, we shall see.

488
01:12:26,847 --> 01:12:31,727
- Relax, I've done this before.
- That's all right ...

489
01:12:33,353 --> 01:12:37,858
- So have l.
- Let me go pee first.

490
01:13:49,179 --> 01:13:54,518
- Did you even look at this?
- That bill was in Japanese.

491
01:13:54,684 --> 01:13:59,731
- The numbers are the same.
- The man did not speak English.

492
01:13:59,898 --> 01:14:06,655
- You look before paying a bill.
- I didn't understand what he said.

493
01:14:07,697 --> 01:14:10,867
Hello ... Yes.

494
01:14:11,034 --> 01:14:15,455
- Maybe it was in yen.
- Maybe it is.

495
01:14:16,665 --> 01:14:21,169
Todd, it's Mr. Denker.
He sounds very anxious.

496
01:14:24,881 --> 01:14:29,302
- Why should he ring now?
- Come over.

497
01:14:29,469 --> 01:14:38,061
- I'm having a heart attack.
- I have to study my trig.

498
01:14:38,228 --> 01:14:41,356
I understand you cannot talk.

499
01:14:41,565 --> 01:14:45,861
I cannot call an ambulance.
I need help.

500
01:14:46,027 --> 01:14:49,197
And that means you need help.

501
01:14:49,406 --> 01:14:54,035
- If you put it that way.
- Tell your parents I have a letter.

502
01:14:54,244 --> 01:14:59,207
- That I need you to read it to me.
- Sure, I'll be right over.

503
01:15:00,751 --> 01:15:04,087
Now we'll see what you're made of.

504
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:24,232
What happened?

505
01:15:24,441 --> 01:15:28,612
- Where are you bleeding?
- It's not my blood.

506
01:15:28,779 --> 01:15:31,907
It was self-defence.

507
01:15:32,074 --> 01:15:34,618
- What?
- Shut up!

508
01:15:34,826 --> 01:15:40,123
Nobody comes here before you
have done what needs to be done.

509
01:15:40,290 --> 01:15:43,293
Go down the steps.

510
01:15:53,303 --> 01:15:58,433
- What did you do?
- Go down the steps.

511
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:01,520
That's right.

512
01:16:15,826 --> 01:16:19,246
Let me the fuck out of here.

513
01:16:19,413 --> 01:16:26,420
If you won't help me,
I have to make you. That's enough!

514
01:16:34,261 --> 01:16:40,934
If you're going to behave
like a fucking schoolgirl ...

515
01:16:42,185 --> 01:16:46,356
I'm going to break your
goddamn door down!

516
01:16:53,196 --> 01:16:57,200
Don't be afraid, boy.

517
01:17:00,162 --> 01:17:04,332
- Now what are you doing?
- I'll break the door down.

518
01:17:04,499 --> 01:17:10,464
What are you doing?
There is no point.

519
01:17:43,622 --> 01:17:47,292
Why are you doing this?

520
01:19:19,009 --> 01:19:22,763
Call an ambulance.

521
01:19:25,140 --> 01:19:27,934
The key.

522
01:19:29,853 --> 01:19:34,483
The key of the safe-deposit box,
where is it?

523
01:19:34,649 --> 01:19:39,613
I need a doctor. Now.

524
01:19:40,697 --> 01:19:43,533
Give me the key.

525
01:19:46,203 --> 01:19:50,332
I'm dying.

526
01:19:51,041 --> 01:19:54,795
I know.

527
01:19:59,966 --> 01:20:05,889
Oh, no ... not like this.
Please.

528
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:21,238
You did good, son.

529
01:20:21,405 --> 01:20:24,032
You did real good.

530
01:20:46,847 --> 01:20:52,394
It's a good thing you called.
You saved his life.

531
01:21:25,260 --> 01:21:30,307
Dad, let's go and make sure
he gets checked-in all right.

532
01:22:37,707 --> 01:22:39,835
You shouldn't have.

533
01:22:41,628 --> 01:22:45,048
It's from my mother.

534
01:22:49,594 --> 01:22:54,182
They say the operation
was a success.

535
01:22:55,183 --> 01:22:59,104
They say I have another 20 years.

536
01:22:59,312 --> 01:23:04,192
A new lease on life.

537
01:23:17,247 --> 01:23:22,377
I took care of everything.
Where is the key?

538
01:23:30,385 --> 01:23:34,765
There's no safe-deposit box.

539
01:23:34,931 --> 01:23:39,519
There never was. I lied.

540
01:23:41,563 --> 01:23:45,776
I had to protect myself from you.

541
01:23:45,942 --> 01:23:49,071
You understand?

542
01:23:54,076 --> 01:23:59,915
I suspect that we will never
see each other again.

543
01:24:00,082 --> 01:24:03,418
- No.
- Wait.

544
01:24:03,627 --> 01:24:07,547
I want to ask you something.

545
01:24:08,965 --> 01:24:12,886
What?

546
01:24:13,053 --> 01:24:17,265
What did it feel like?

547
01:24:25,982 --> 01:24:29,736
- I better go.
- Wait.

548
01:24:29,945 --> 01:24:35,742
Perhaps I could
persuade you to stay.

549
01:24:35,909 --> 01:24:42,082
Just until I fall asleep.
My medicine makes me drowsy.

550
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:47,546
Please?

551
01:25:16,908 --> 01:25:22,664
You are a very good boy
to visit your grandfather like that.

552
01:25:22,831 --> 01:25:29,004
- Thank you. He's just a friend.
- You are a very good friend.

553
01:25:29,212 --> 01:25:35,969
Is he very bad off?
He doesn't talk much.

554
01:25:36,136 --> 01:25:39,556
- He'll be out soon.
- That's good news.

555
01:25:39,765 --> 01:25:43,977
From his accent,
I would guess he was German.

556
01:25:44,144 --> 01:25:48,523
- From the south, I think.
- I don't know.

557
01:25:48,690 --> 01:25:51,610
Was he in the war?

558
01:25:52,736 --> 01:25:57,699
- He's never mentioned it.
- It doesn't matter, I suppose.

559
01:25:57,908 --> 01:26:03,830
It was a long time ago, the war.
Soon we will have a President -

560
01:26:03,997 --> 01:26:09,836
- born after the war was over.
How about that?

561
01:26:11,171 --> 01:26:16,385
- I'm sure you're right.
- He's very lucky to have you.

562
01:26:16,593 --> 01:26:19,054
A great man once said:

563
01:26:19,221 --> 01:26:23,767
"No man is an island,
entire of itself."

564
01:26:23,934 --> 01:26:28,730
John Donne. Have a nice evening.

565
01:26:42,786 --> 01:26:47,416
- You stop that kind of talk.
- How about this kind of talk?

566
01:26:54,631 --> 01:26:58,301
That's just a warning.

567
01:26:58,468 --> 01:27:02,556
If you crave for Florence's food,
that's a weird craving.

568
01:27:02,723 --> 01:27:08,812
- Jenny's the one who's pregnant.
- They had something to tell us.

569
01:27:09,020 --> 01:27:12,607
We 're going
to be grandparents again.

570
01:27:12,816 --> 01:27:16,862
Ijust can't wait
to tell everybody.

571
01:29:15,981 --> 01:29:19,735
What's wrong?

572
01:29:45,761 --> 01:29:48,388
Wake up.

573
01:29:51,808 --> 01:29:57,856
- Are you talking to me?
- Yes, I'm speaking to you.

574
01:30:19,669 --> 01:30:23,090
Mr. Kramer
is recuperating elsewhere.

575
01:30:23,298 --> 01:30:26,802
- Are you awake now, Dussander?
- Yes.

576
01:30:26,968 --> 01:30:32,099
But you seem to have confused me
with someone else.

577
01:30:32,307 --> 01:30:38,313
My name is Denker.
You have the wrong room.

578
01:30:38,522 --> 01:30:42,192
My name is Weiskopf,
and you are Kurt Dussander.

579
01:30:42,401 --> 01:30:48,740
I know no one by that name.
Should I call the nurse?

580
01:30:50,575 --> 01:30:57,165
Benjamin Kramer was imprisoned
for 1 0 months at Patin.

581
01:30:57,332 --> 01:31:01,002
You were responsible for the death
of his wife and daughters.

582
01:31:01,211 --> 01:31:05,674
My name is Arthur Denker.
I am an American.

583
01:31:05,882 --> 01:31:11,430
Don't bother. Your papers won't
stand up to serious examination.

584
01:31:12,514 --> 01:31:15,350
We have all we need here.

585
01:31:15,559 --> 01:31:19,688
I'm Dan Richler, FBl.
This is Detective Getty, LAPD.

586
01:31:19,855 --> 01:31:24,818
You know who I work for. When you're
strong enough you will be moved.

587
01:31:25,068 --> 01:31:28,447
Until then, this entire ward
will be under guard.

588
01:31:28,613 --> 01:31:33,285
You can expect to be in Jerusalem
by the end of the summer.

589
01:31:51,344 --> 01:31:56,391
- Where do you want us to sit?
- Anywhere but the front row.

590
01:31:56,558 --> 01:31:59,728
There's Carla.

591
01:31:59,936 --> 01:32:03,440
- Hi, Chelsea.
- Congratulations.

592
01:32:12,741 --> 01:32:16,411
- Hey, Todd.
- Mr. French.

593
01:32:16,578 --> 01:32:20,707
You did it. I knew you could.
I'm so proud of you.

594
01:32:20,874 --> 01:32:25,754
- These must be your parents.
- Dick Bowden.

595
01:32:25,921 --> 01:32:30,801
Your son really pulled one off.
You must be very proud.

596
01:32:30,967 --> 01:32:37,933
- Are you a teacher of Todd's?
- I'm his guidance counsellor.

597
01:32:38,100 --> 01:32:41,686
I was looking forward
to seeing your grandfather.

598
01:32:41,895 --> 01:32:46,066
It's a long trip from Charlotte.
He's been in a wheelchair for years.

599
01:32:46,233 --> 01:32:50,445
They don't get out much.
Usually Thanksgiving.

600
01:32:53,073 --> 01:32:57,077
I'm sorry ... I don't understand.

601
01:32:59,496 --> 01:33:03,834
- That's your cue.
- That's my cue.

602
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:07,504
Nice to meet you.

603
01:33:10,841 --> 01:33:14,594
I don't feel so well.
Let's leave early.

604
01:33:14,845 --> 01:33:19,599
- Are you okay?
- It's probably nerves.

605
01:33:19,766 --> 01:33:21,810
Let's see how it goes.

606
01:33:25,897 --> 01:33:31,820
All great achievements
arose from dissatisfaction.

607
01:33:33,238 --> 01:33:37,409
It is the desire to do better,
to dig deeper, -

608
01:33:37,576 --> 01:33:41,705
- that propels a civilisation
to greatness.

609
01:33:41,872 --> 01:33:45,542
All of us
have heard the story of lkaros.

610
01:33:45,709 --> 01:33:49,212
The young boy who took
the wings his father built for him.

611
01:33:49,421 --> 01:33:53,175
Wings that were meant to carry him
over the ocean to freedom.

612
01:33:53,341 --> 01:33:59,347
He used them instead
for a joyride.

613
01:34:08,440 --> 01:34:13,487
For a brief moment lkaros felt
what it was like to live as a god.

614
01:34:14,362 --> 01:34:18,533
To touch the sun.
To soar above the common man.

615
01:34:19,659 --> 01:34:23,038
And for doing so
he paid the ultimate price.

616
01:34:24,748 --> 01:34:28,168
Come down to the cellar,
you won't believe this.

617
01:34:28,377 --> 01:34:31,880
Like lkaros,
we too have been given gifts:

618
01:34:32,047 --> 01:34:37,386
Knowledge, education, experience.

619
01:34:38,678 --> 01:34:42,432
And with these gifts
comes the responsibility of choice.

620
01:34:42,641 --> 01:34:46,228
We alone decide how our talents
are bestowed upon the world.

621
01:34:46,436 --> 01:34:52,067
This is our destiny, and we hold it
in the palm of our hands.

622
01:35:48,790 --> 01:35:55,672
An investigation by police, FBl,
and the Department of Justice, -

623
01:35:55,839 --> 01:36:01,344
- has uncovered a body
in the house of Arthur Denker, -

624
01:36:01,511 --> 01:36:06,475
- the man believed
to be a Nazi war criminal.

625
01:36:06,683 --> 01:36:09,519
Cause of death has been withheld.

626
01:36:09,686 --> 01:36:15,650
Identification of the body
is pending further investigation.

627
01:36:15,817 --> 01:36:20,363
The apprehension of Dussander
brings to a close a manhunt -

628
01:36:20,530 --> 01:36:24,367
- that has been underway
for 40 years in three continents.

629
01:36:35,670 --> 01:36:39,007
I'll be taking care of you now.

630
01:36:40,675 --> 01:36:44,346
Try to relax.

631
01:36:45,222 --> 01:36:49,684
I'm Dan Richler of the FBl,
and this is Dr. Weiskopf.

632
01:36:49,851 --> 01:36:53,438
I'd like to hear about
your involvement with Dussander.

633
01:36:53,605 --> 01:36:58,485
Actually, to you Arthur Denker.
How did you know him?

634
01:36:58,693 --> 01:37:03,115
- Do you feel up to this.
- Yeah, I'll be fine.

635
01:37:10,205 --> 01:37:12,249
Here's the thing ...

636
01:37:12,416 --> 01:37:18,380
You said Denker had a heart attack
while you were reading him a letter.

637
01:37:18,547 --> 01:37:22,300
- Was it in English or German?
- German.

638
01:37:23,844 --> 01:37:26,596
- You speak German?
- No.

639
01:37:26,763 --> 01:37:33,353
- You had no idea what it said?
- No, but he seemed to understand.

640
01:37:39,401 --> 01:37:43,405
What we can't seem to figure out
is the letter, Todd.

641
01:37:43,572 --> 01:37:49,244
- Do you know where it is?
- I guess it's still on the table.

642
01:37:49,453 --> 01:37:56,043
Then it should still be there.
Did you see it, Mr. Bowden?

643
01:37:56,251 --> 01:38:00,589
No, I wasn't looking for a letter.
I was concerned about Todd.

644
01:38:00,756 --> 01:38:05,135
- Maybe somebody took it.
- Why would somebody steal a letter?

645
01:38:05,302 --> 01:38:11,266
Unless they wanted to protect him.
Another fugitive.

646
01:38:11,475 --> 01:38:14,978
I know all this sounds
like Robert Ludlum, -

647
01:38:15,187 --> 01:38:22,444
- but while Dussander was in the
hospital someone swiped the letter.

648
01:38:22,652 --> 01:38:27,407
- That doesn't make sense.
- Why not?

649
01:38:28,325 --> 01:38:33,205
If he had an old Nazi buddy in town,
why didn't he read the letter?

650
01:38:33,413 --> 01:38:36,416
Maybe he's crippled or blind.

651
01:38:36,583 --> 01:38:41,713
Guys that are blind don't normally
go scooting out to steal letters.

652
01:38:43,131 --> 01:38:47,636
Did he ever talk about his past?

653
01:38:50,472 --> 01:38:53,183
No.

654
01:38:53,350 --> 01:38:58,814
- What kind of doctor are you?
- I'm a school teacher.

655
01:38:59,815 --> 01:39:03,402
Dr. Weiskopf is a professor
at the Judaic lnstitute in Munich.

656
01:39:03,610 --> 01:39:09,366
He assists the lsraeli Government
in certain matters.

657
01:39:45,485 --> 01:39:49,531
Hey, buddy, are you okay?

658
01:39:49,698 --> 01:39:53,535
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Are you sure?

659
01:39:56,621 --> 01:40:01,960
I just can't believe it.
Even after what those guys told me.

660
01:40:02,127 --> 01:40:06,173
Your mother and I
feel like we let you down.

661
01:40:06,339 --> 01:40:13,221
- It's not your fault.
- We're going to talk to a lawyer.

662
01:40:13,388 --> 01:40:18,852
It's nothing to worry about.
I just don't trust these cops.

663
01:40:19,019 --> 01:40:21,646
I think that's a good idea.

664
01:40:21,813 --> 01:40:26,318
Your old man's on top of this.
I'll take care of this.

665
01:40:29,446 --> 01:40:31,990
Dad ...

666
01:40:32,199 --> 01:40:37,788
- I never knew anything about this.
- I never thought you did.

667
01:40:37,954 --> 01:40:42,918
- I know.
- See you later.

668
01:40:48,799 --> 01:40:54,262
- Will you talk to the boy again?
- I don't think so.

669
01:40:54,471 --> 01:40:58,558
Somehow he didn't even ...

670
01:40:58,725 --> 01:41:04,314
When you were a boy,
what did you do for fun?

671
01:41:05,524 --> 01:41:08,527
I went to the movies.

672
01:41:08,693 --> 01:41:14,491
- What did you do?
- I used to chase girls.

673
01:41:16,827 --> 01:41:20,330
And now I chase old men.

674
01:41:49,025 --> 01:41:56,241
This is the hospital administrator
and his chief of staff.

675
01:41:57,367 --> 01:42:01,038
- Do we have a plan?
- They've arranged an exit for us.

676
01:42:13,216 --> 01:42:17,721
Mr. French, what are you doing here?

677
01:42:27,230 --> 01:42:31,860
- Are your parents home?
- No. What is it about?

678
01:42:32,069 --> 01:42:36,698
- That's between me and them.
- Why isn't it between you and me?

679
01:42:38,742 --> 01:42:42,329
Do you want to tell me
what happened?

680
01:43:43,390 --> 01:43:47,310
Turn him on his left side.

681
01:43:50,147 --> 01:43:54,776
- I wouldn't know where to begin.
- You have to tell me something.

682
01:43:56,653 --> 01:44:01,616
I can tell you it would be better
if we both forget about it.

683
01:44:01,825 --> 01:44:05,412
I'm sorry, I can't do that.

684
01:44:14,629 --> 01:44:19,176
Tell your parents
I'll be back to see them later.

685
01:44:19,342 --> 01:44:23,180
Mr. French ...

686
01:44:23,388 --> 01:44:27,434
I thought we had a deal here.
"The world will open up for you."

687
01:44:27,601 --> 01:44:32,647
- You want me to forget about this?
- I want to get on with my life.

688
01:44:32,856 --> 01:44:39,654
It was a mistake to come here.
I'll do this over the phone.

689
01:44:43,992 --> 01:44:49,498
Hey, Ed? Can I call you Ed, now
that I'm out of your fucking school?

690
01:44:54,711 --> 01:44:59,591
Does it ever work?
Or am I the first one?

691
01:44:59,800 --> 01:45:03,845
If I'm the first, I'm flattered,
but I don't believe that.

692
01:45:04,012 --> 01:45:10,185
Not after you fixing my grades.
Giving me your home phone number.

693
01:45:10,352 --> 01:45:14,439
You've got some balls!

694
01:45:14,606 --> 01:45:18,527
Is this why your wife left you?

695
01:45:24,533 --> 01:45:28,537
You must really have wanted
to shake my hand or something else.

696
01:45:28,704 --> 01:45:32,541
Are you going to tell people
I did something to you?

697
01:45:32,749 --> 01:45:35,877
I'll drag you down with me.

698
01:45:36,044 --> 01:45:41,466
- I'm better at this than you are.
- I'm trying to help you.

699
01:45:41,633 --> 01:45:45,053
- I won't just do nothing.
- You're going to fucking have to!

700
01:45:49,599 --> 01:45:56,732
The things I'm going to say,
they'll never go away.

701
01:45:58,692 --> 01:46:04,364
Think of your job.
Think of your son.

702
01:46:21,298 --> 01:46:26,845
What's the story here, Ed?
Do we have a deal?

703
01:46:33,435 --> 01:46:37,272
You can't do this, Todd.

704
01:46:37,481 --> 01:46:40,233
You have no idea what I can do.

705
01:46:41,233 --> 01:46:51,233
