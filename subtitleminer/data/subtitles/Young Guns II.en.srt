PROMINENT RANCHERS' HERDS

335
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,690
LIKE JOHN CHISUM'S.

336
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:30,810
YES, SIR. THEY HAVE.

337
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:32,940
AND YOU HAVE, TOO.

338
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,900
HOWEVER...

339
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:37,950
YOU'RE ONE,

340
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:40,450
AND THE MURPHY-DOLAN RUSTLERS
ARE MANY.

341
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:42,950
IF YOU CAN TESTIFY
AGAINST WHAT YOU SAW

342
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:44,950
IN YOUR LITTLE WAR,

343
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:48,500
I CAN THEN ELIMINATE
THE MANY.

344
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,500
WELL...

345
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,210
WHAT ABOUT THE ONE?

346
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:55,960
MY TERMS ARE SIMPLE--

347
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,970
YOUR TESTIMONY AGAINST THOSE
WHO MURDERED YOUR EMPLOYER

348
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:01,550
IN EXCHANGE FOR LENIENCY.

349
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:02,930
NO.

350
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:07,560
MY TESTIMONY IN EXCHANGE
FOR A FULL PARDON.

351
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,600
WELL,
I'M AFRAID THAT'S--

352
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,980
I TESTIFY,

353
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:14,610
AND I RIDE OUT OF LINCOLN
A FREE MAN.

354
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,820
IF NOT,
I RIDE OUT OF LINCOLN NOW.

355
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:20,200
ANY OF YOUR BOYS
TRY TO FOLLOW ME,

356
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,620
THEY'LL WIND UP
IN A PINE BOX.

357
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,840
IF YOU
WERE GIVEN PARDON,

358
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,720
YOU WOULD LEAVE
NEW MEXICO,

359
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,720
NEVER TO RETURN?

360
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,720
YOU GO ON THE STAND

361
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,350
AND HELP ME HANG
15 RUSTLERS,

362
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:52,980
AND I'LL GIVE YOU
PARDON.

363
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,780
HA HA HA HA!

364
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,820
OF COURSE,
15 MINUTES LATER,

365
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:03,030
THE MURPHY BOYS WILL SHOOT YOU
DEAD AS A MANGY DOG

366
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:04,830
IN THE STREET.

367
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,830
SO WE'LL ARREST YOU,

368
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,870
A STAGED ARREST
FOR YOUR OWN PROTECTION

369
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:10,000
BEFORE THE TRIAL.

370
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:13,420
BUT THAT'S FOR YOU
TO DECIDE.

371
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:16,000
CAN I HAVE
SOME OF THAT CAKE?

372
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:19,880
PENDLETON.

373
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:25,890
UH-UH, PENDLETON.

374
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:27,850
UH-UH.

375
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:30,890
THE, UH...
THE WHITE CAKE

376
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:32,980
WITH THE SWEET FROST.

377
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:45,990
SO...

378
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:46,990
SHALL WE PROCLAIM

379
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:48,990
OUR SECRET PARLEY
A SUCCESS?

380
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,000
IT'S A DEAL.

381
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,010
WHEN THE NECK IS BROKEN,
THERE'S ONLY A SHARP PAIN, FAST.

382
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:04,010
THEN IF THE OTHER PLACE
ACCEPTS YOU,

383
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:06,010
THE SPIRIT HORSE COMES.

384
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:09,010
IT TAKES YOU THERE
TO THE OTHER SIDE.

385
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,020
SO DON'T WORRY TOO MUCH.

386
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:13,020
WHEN YOU DIE, YOU'RE GONNA SEE
THE SPIRIT HORSE.

387
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,020
SHE'LL COME FOR YOU,
MY FRIEND.

388
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,020
GREAT. LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING, CHAVEZ.

389
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:20,030
I DON'T REALLY WANT TO CATCH
A SPIRIT HORSE.

390
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:22,030
I DON'T EVEN WANT TO SEE
THE OTHER SIDE.

391
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:24,030
I SURE AS HELL DON'T WANNA
HAVE MY NECK BROKE

392
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:26,030
THROUGH A SHARP, QUICK PAIN.

393
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:27,950
THE ONLY THING
I REALLY WANT TO DO

394
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:29,950
IS GET THE HELL
OUT OF HERE.

395
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:30,950
ME, TOO.

396
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:49,970
[APPLAUSE]

397
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:51,970
WELL DONE, WILLIAM.
SPLENDID PERFORMANCE.

398
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:54,060
HOWEVER, THERE ARE
THREE CANDLES LEFT

399
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:56,980
AND ONLY TWO BULLETS.

400
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:59,980
[GUNSHOT]

401
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:01,980
SPLENDID, SPLENDID!

402
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,110
WHAT DID I SAY?
DIDN'T I TELL YOU?

403
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,990
MR. BONNEY...

404
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:09,990
DISTRICT ATTORNEY RYNERSON'S
HERE TO SEE YOU.

405
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:11,990
THE GOVERNOR
THINKS IT'S BEST

406
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,120
IF YOU HAVE
YOUR RESTRAINTS ON.

407
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
HEY, SHERIFF?

408
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:19,000
CAN YOU BRING THAT
FIDDLE PLAYER IN AGAIN?

409
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,170
HE WAS QUITE GOOD.

410
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:23,010
HOW ABOUT SOME MORE CAKE
WHEN YOU GET A CHANCE?

411
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:25,010
AND IT'S GETTING
A LITTLE NIPPY IN HERE.

412
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:27,010
COULD YOU STOKE UP
THAT FIRE?

413
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:27,970
THANKS, GEORGE.

414
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:29,140
YES, SIR.

415
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:33,970
I WAS STARTING TO GROW FOND
OF PRISON LIFE.

416
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:36,940
TOP OF THE MORNING
TO YOU, MR. BONNEY.

417
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:39,980
FINALLY IN CHAINS,
ARE YOU?

418
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:42,190
STILL TRYING TO
KEEP UP YOUR GAME?

419
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,190
WELL,
WE'LL BE SEEING YOU

420
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:46,990
ON THE FLOOR
OF THE COURTS VERY SOON.

421
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:48,200
I AIN'T BEING TRIED.

422
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,200
I'M TESTIFYING AGAINST DOLAN
AND ALL THE OTHER SWINE

423
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,620
WHO KILLED MY FRIEND
JOHN TUNSTALL. YES, SIR.

424
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:55,000
ARE THE BLOODY COCKS
STILL RUNNING THE COOP?

425
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,250
AH, TO BE SURE.
THAT'S RIGHT.

426
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:59,000
HA HA HA!

427
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,250
HMM.

428
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,010
WHO GIVES TESTIMONY

429
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:08,010
IS STRICTLY
WITHIN THE DISCRETION

430
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:10,010
OF THE PROSECUTING
ATTORNEY,

431
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:12,010
WHO HAPPENS TO BE ME,

432
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:16,020
WHO HAPPENS TO THINK
NOT A BLOODY CHANCE

433
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:18,350
IN THE PIT OF HADES.

434
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:20,980
UGH!

435
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,020
YOU CAN'T BLUFF ME.

436
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,400
NO.

437
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,320
I'LL CHARGE YOU,
SENTENCE YOU.

438
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,950
I WILLHANG YOU...

439
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:33,950
BUT I'D NEVER
BLUFF YOU.

440
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:36,370
SEE FOR YOURSELF.

441
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:42,420
THE GOVERNOR'S ON HIS WAY
BACK TO SANTA FE NOW.

442
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:45,420
PARDON BILLY THE KID!
IMPOSSIBLE!

443
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:48,420
I SHOULD HAVE DUSTED
HIS EXCELLENCY'S REGAL ASS

444
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,430
WHEN I HAD THE CHANCE.

445
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:52,970
HE DIDN'T EXACTLY
LIE TO ME.

446
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:55,970
HE JUST DIDN'T HAVE THE POWER
AGAINST THE IRISH POLITICIANS

447
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:58,430
WHO WERE STILL RUNNING
LINCOLN COUNTY.

448
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:02,480
GOOD DAY, MR. BONNEY.

449
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,980
GOOD DAY, MR. DUNG PILE.

450
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:09,490
HA HA HA!

451
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:13,530
AIN'T THAT A BEAUT?

452
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:14,530
HA HA HA!

453
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:17,540
ANOTHER HISTORICAL
AND BIOLOGICAL FACT

454
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:20,000
WAS THAT
I HAD SMALL HANDS

455
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,580
AND BIG WRISTS.

456
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
AND THAT HAS SAVED MY LIFE

457
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,760
MORE TIMES
THAN COLONEL COLT'S EQUALIZER.

458
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,510
LOOKS LIKE IT'S GETTING
NEAR TO SUPPER TIME.

459
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:32,970
YOU BOYS HUNGRY?

460
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:36,560
I GOT TWO LOTS
OF NEWS FOR YOU--

461
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,970
GOOD AND BAD.

462
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:40,770
I'LL GIVE YOU
THE BAD NEWS FIRST.

463

ALL WE GOT FOR SUPPER
IS HORSESHIT.

464

HA HA HA HA!

00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:47,610
WHAT THE HELL'S
THE GOOD NEWS?

WHICH I HEAR TELL
THEY INTEND TO DO.

473
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,010

816
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:11,010
OH, YOU'LL GET DOWN BELOW

817
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:13,010
YOU'LL GET DOWN BELOW.

818
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:16,510
YOU'RE BILLY THE KID,
TOO, YOU KNOW.

819
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:20,020
YOU ALL ARE
DIRTY LITTLE BILLY BASTARDS,

820
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:24,020
AND I DON'T OWE YOU
ANYTHING, DOC.

821
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:25,650
OR YOU, CHAVEZ...

822
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:28,610
YOU TOOK MY FARM,
MR. CHISUM.

823
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:33,950
YOU TOOK A LOT OF FARMS,
MR. CHISUM.

824
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:36,660
AS LONG AS BILLY THE KID
IS TAKING SOME BACK,

825
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:37,950
I'M WITH HIM.

826
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:41,660
EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT,
MR. CHISUM?

827
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:44,170
YES, YES.
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

828
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:46,420
UH...GO ON AND BRING
THE MEN IN,

829
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:48,670
AND WE'LL HAVE
A LITTLE FRESH COFFEE

830
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,670
WITH THE BOYS HERE.

831
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:51,970
YOO-HOO!

832
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:54,720
I'LL MAKE YOU FAMOUS.

833
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,720
MR. CHISUM, WHICH ONE
OF THESE BOYS

834
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,010
IS THE FASTEST
WITH THE IRON?

835
00:42:58,010 --> 00:42:59,720
DON'T YOU DO IT,
BILLY.

836
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:02,020
THAT BE ME.

837
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:03,980
YOU.

838
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:05,770
DROP SAM COLT.

839
00:43:05,770 --> 00:43:06,980
BILLY...

840
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:08,770
PUT HER DOWN NOW.

841
00:43:10,030 --> 00:43:11,780
STEP AWAY.

842
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:20,990
YOU OWE ME $5OO,
MR. CHISUM,

843
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:25,040
SO WHAT I'M GOING TO DO
IS KILL ONE OF YOUR MEN

844
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,500
FOR EVERY $5.OO YOU OWE ME.

845
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,960
ONLY I'M GOING TO
DO IT FAIR.

846
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:40,970
HOW'S THAT FOR SQUARE?

847
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:45,890
NOW, WHEN I GO FOR MY GUN,

848
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:46,980
YOU START SHOOTING.

849
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:50,860
BUT I PROMISE YOU,
YOU WILL NOT MAKE IT.

850
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:54,990
READY?

851
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:57,910
YEAH, I'M READY.

852
00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:00,990
DAVE.

853
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
OH, MY GOD!

854
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
495.

855
00:44:13,010 --> 00:44:14,010
HENDRY.

856
00:44:15,010 --> 00:44:17,010
OH, MY GOD!

857
00:44:17,010 --> 00:44:19,010
HENDRY.

858
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:27,020
49O.

859
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:28,940
YOU JUST KILLED YOURSELF.

860
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:34,940
BONNEY, YOU ARE A FOOL!

861
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:38,950
YOU CALL YOURSELF
THE SCOURGE OF NEW MEXICO?

862
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:42,950
WELL, BY GOD,
IAMNEW MEXICO,

863
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:45,950
AND YOU ARE DEAD.

864
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:47,960
HA HA!

865
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:49,960
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING,
MR. NEW MEXICO.

866
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,960
I WOULDN'T GIVE
A BUCKET OF PISS

867
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:53,960
FOR YOUR FUTURE.

868
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:56,970
SKIN OUT, BOYS.

869
00:44:56,970 --> 00:44:59,970
YOU HAVE YOURSELF
A GOOD DAY NOW.

870
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:09,060
I WANT HIM DEAD.

871
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:11,060
WELL, THE PROBLEM IS
HE'S PROTECTED

872
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:13,070
BY THE SURROUNDING
COMMUNITIES.

873
00:45:13,070 --> 00:45:14,980
THEY'VE
MADE A BLOODY HERO

874
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:16,990
OUT OF A HALF-WIT
COMMON HORSE THIEF.

875
00:45:16,990 --> 00:45:18,070
THAT'S WHAT I SAY!

876
00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:23,120
LET'S HIRE A THIEF
TO CATCH ONE.

877
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:25,990
NOW BRING HIM IN,
GOVERNOR,

878
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:27,080
AND MAKE THE OFFER.

879
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:31,960
PENDLETON.

880
00:45:56,190 --> 00:45:58,190
IF I'VE BEEN BROUGHT HERE
TO BE, UH...

881
00:45:58,190 --> 00:45:59,990
IMPLICATED IN ANYTHING,

882
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:01,990
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT I'M A FAMILY MAN,

883
00:46:01,990 --> 00:46:04,200
FIXING TO SETTLE
AND RUN A BUSINESS.

884
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:06,990
MR. CHISUM HAS INFORMED US
OF YOUR AMBITIONS,

885
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:08,250
MR. GARRETT.

886
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:11,000
NOW, WE KNOW THAT YOU'VE
BEEN WITH BILLY BONNEY

887
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,500
SEVERAL TIMES
WHEN HE CUT MY HERD.

888
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:15,880
NOW, PAT,
WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY

889
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:18,460
WHO KNOWS HIS HAUNTS,
HIS, UH, HIDEOUTS,

890
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:21,010
SOMEBODY WHO'S FAMILIAR
WITH HIS PATTERNS.

891
00:46:21,010 --> 00:46:24,010
YOUAREFAMILIAR WITH HIM,
MR. GARRETT.

892
00:46:24,010 --> 00:46:27,010
YOU SEE, PATRICK...

893
00:46:27,010 --> 00:46:29,270
CERTAIN CHANGES
NEED TO BE STRUCTURED.

894
00:46:29,270 --> 00:46:30,930
WE NEED A SHERIFF

895
00:46:30,930 --> 00:46:32,940
WHO CAN ELIMINATE
THIS PARTICULAR...

896
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:34,270
PROBLEM.

897
00:46:36,270 --> 00:46:39,110
I DON'T QUITE FOLLOW
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

898
00:46:39,110 --> 00:46:41,950
WE'RE SAYING
SHERIFF OF LINCOLN COUNTY.

899
00:46:41,950 --> 00:46:43,950
SHERIFF PAT GARRETT.

900
00:46:43,950 --> 00:46:47,370
NOW THAT OUGHT TO
MAKE YOU FEEL PRETTY GOOD.

901
00:46:47,370 --> 00:46:51,370
AND WE'RE SAYING $5OO...

902
00:46:51,370 --> 00:46:52,960

AND 5OO AFTER.

904
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:58,380
$1,OOO, MR. GARRETT.

905
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:00,920
AND ALL THE RESOURCES
YOU NEED

906
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:03,430
TO CARRY OUT
THE EXTERMINATION

907
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:06,430
OF ONE
WILLIAM H. BONNEY.

908
00:47:06,430 --> 00:47:09,970
IS THAT SATISFACTORY?

909
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:18,980
WHILE PAT WAS THINKING

910
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:21,990
ABOUT THE SANTA FE RING'S
GENEROUS OFFER,

911
00:47:21,990 --> 00:47:24,950
ME AND THE BOYS WERE BUSY
SORTING OUT OUR FINANCES.

912
00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:27,950
WE FIGURED THAT IF IT WAS
TOO MUCH OF A HARDSHIP

913
00:47:27,950 --> 00:47:29,950
FOR CHISUM
TO GIVE US ANY MONEY...

914
00:47:29,950 --> 00:47:31,910
HOWDY.

915
00:47:31,950 --> 00:47:33,960
WELL,
THEN WE'D HELP HIM OUT

916
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:36,460
AND JUST TAKE
A FEW OF HIS COWS.

917
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:38,960
I GUESS WHAT
I'M TRYING TO SAY IS,

918
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:39,920
YOU'RE CALLED KID,

919
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:41,960
AND RUDABAUGH'S
CALLED ARKANSAS DAVE,

920
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:43,920
AND, UH, I DARESAY

921
00:47:43,970 --> 00:47:45,970
DOC'S CHRISTIAN NAME
AIN'T DOC.

922
00:47:45,970 --> 00:47:47,930
YOU WANT A NAME.

923
00:47:47,970 --> 00:47:49,930
YES, SIR.
I WOULD LIKE THAT.

924
00:47:49,970 --> 00:47:52,980
I WOULD LIKE THAT
VERY MUCH INDEED.

925
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:54,940
YOU HAVE TO EARN IT,
HENDRY.

926
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:57,980
UNTIL THEN, YOU'RE STUCK
WITH PLAIN OLD HENDRY.

927
00:47:57,980 --> 00:47:59,020
SORRY.

928
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:02,030
[RINGING]

929
00:48:25,010 --> 00:48:26,130
[CLICK]

930
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:46,190
STILL TRYING TO GET
THIS RAG SHEET

931
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:47,950
OFF THE GROUND, ASH?

932
00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:51,160
THE COPY IS GOOD.
THE MACHINE IS BAD.

933
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,950
I HEAR YOU'RE GOING TO BE
OPENING UP AN EATING HOUSE,

934
00:48:52,950 --> 00:48:53,950
GARRETT.

935
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:56,960
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SECURE
AN ADVERTISEMENT?

936
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,210
I'VE CHANGED MY MIND.

937
00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:01,960
JEEZUM CROW.

938
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:04,960
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT
THE SANTA FE RING HIRED--

939
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,260
NEVER MIND THAT.

940
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:07,970
I WANT TO HIRE YOU
FOR A JOB.

941
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:09,260
YOU DO?

942
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:11,970
I WANT YOU TO DOCUMENT
THE HUNT

943
00:49:11,970 --> 00:49:14,310
FOR THE MOST FAMOUS MAN
IN NEW MEXICO.

944
00:49:14,310 --> 00:49:16,310
I WANT
A BOOK WRITTEN ON IT

945
00:49:16,310 --> 00:49:18,980
SO THAT THE PEOPLE WILL
UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION.

946
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:21,310
I WANT YOU
TO RIDE ALONG WITH ME

947
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:22,980
AND RECORD THE DANGERS
OF THE EXPEDITION.

948
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:26,360
RIDEALONG WITH YOU?
ON A HORSE?

949
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:27,900
OH, NO.

950
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:29,280
THIS I CAN'T DO.

951
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:33,910
I CAME OUT WEST
TO SAVE MY LAST LUNG.

952
00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:35,910
I'M A JOURNALIST.

953
00:49:35,910 --> 00:49:37,910
YOU'RE
A BROKE JOURNALIST,

954
00:49:37,910 --> 00:49:41,330
AND YOU'RE A DRUNK.

955
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:50,930
THE COUNTRY WAS OVERGROWN
WITH WEED AND BRUSH

956
00:49:50,930 --> 00:49:54,180
AND ENCUMBERED
WITH LOOSE ROCK,

957
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:57,430
MAKING IT
ALMOST IMPASSABLE.

958
00:49:57,430 --> 00:49:58,930
I LIKE THAT.

959
00:49:58,930 --> 00:50:00,390
THAT'S VERY GOOD.

960
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:06,440
MORNING, SHERIFF.

961
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:08,440
WE MET AT THE GOVERNOR'S.

962
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:10,950
JOHN W. POE,
CATTLEMEN'S ASSOCIATION.

963
00:50:10,950 --> 00:50:12,950
THE GOVERNOR SENT ME
AND THESE MEN

964
00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:14,950
TO LEND YOU A HAND.

965
00:50:14,950 --> 00:50:16,950
ENCUMBERED BY IDIOTS,
WE PRESSED ON.

966
00:50:17,490 --> 00:50:19,500
I LIKE THAT.

967
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:21,500
IT'S VERY GOOD.

968
00:50:32,970 --> 00:50:35,600
WHAT DID THEY DO NOW--
SPELL YOUR NAME WRONG?

969
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,310
THEY GOT A NEW SHERIFF
ON US, BOYS.

970
00:50:37,310 --> 00:50:38,970
GOES BY THE NAME
OF PAT GARRETT.

971
00:50:38,970 --> 00:50:40,600
JESUS CHRIST!

972
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:43,980
WHAT THE HELL
DID HE DO THAT FOR?

973
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:45,480
MAKE HISSELF FAMOUS.

974
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:47,070
BE A KNOWN MAN LIKE ME.

975
00:50:47,070 --> 00:50:48,610
HEY, WHAT ABOUT ME?

976
00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:49,990
WHAT DID THEY SAY
ABOUT ME, HUH?

977
00:50:49,990 --> 00:50:51,610
NOTHING, DAVE.

978
00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:53,990
JUST PLAYING THE GAME,
DOC.

979
00:50:53,990 --> 00:50:56,490
WE'LL GIVE HIM A GAME,
ALL RIGHT.

980
00:50:56,490 --> 00:50:58,580
ALL RIGHT, DAVE'S BOYS.
WE RIDE NOW.

981
00:50:58,580 --> 00:51:00,660
WE ARE GOING TO GIVE
PAT GARRETT

982
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:02,660
THE RIDE OF HIS MISERABLE
TWO-FACED STINKING LIFE.

983
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:04,000
LET'S SKIN OUT! COME ON!

984
00:51:10,010 --> 00:51:11,720
WELL, COME ON!

985
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:16,760
DO YOU BELIEVE THIS?

986
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:18,010
OK, TOM.

987
00:51:18,010 --> 00:51:21,770
LAST ONE OUT OF HERE
DRINKS DIRTY DISHWATER.

988
00:51:21,770 --> 00:51:23,770
COME ON!

989
00:51:23,770 --> 00:51:25,770
SON OF A BITCH!

990
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:49,960
HO.

991
00:51:52,970 --> 00:51:54,010
BURIAL GROUND.

992
00:51:54,010 --> 00:51:55,970
WARM SPRINGS PEOPLE.

993
00:51:57,970 --> 00:51:59,010
APACHE.

994
00:51:59,010 --> 00:52:01,010
WE BETTER GET GOING.

995
00:52:01,010 --> 00:52:02,520
WE'LL GO AROUND.

996
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:04,020
WHAT IS IT--

997
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:06,020
CHAVEZ, WHY DON'T YOU
GO PECK SHIT

998
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:08,020
WITH THE CHICKENS, HUH?

999
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:10,020
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
THEY'RE PAYING

1000
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:12,030
FOR APACHE BONE
IN SILVER CITY RIGHT NOW?

1001
00:52:12,030 --> 00:52:14,030
CHRIST ALMIGHTY,
THEY'RE MAKING...

1002
00:52:14,030 --> 00:52:16,030
THEY'RE MAKING ASHTRAYS,
THEY'RE MAKING COMBS,

1003
00:52:16,030 --> 00:52:17,030
THEY'RE MAKING
KNIFE HANDLES.

1004
00:52:17,030 --> 00:52:18,990
YOU GET 5O CENTS
FOR A GOOD INDIAN LEG BONE.

1005
00:52:20,030 --> 00:52:21,030
IT'S ALL OUT THERE,

1006
00:52:21,030 --> 00:52:23,040
SO DON'T YOU GO GETTING
SENTIMENTAL AND ALL THAT,

1007
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,000
COME ON.

1008
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:27,040
YOU GO IN THERE,
SMART GRINGO,

1009
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:28,960
AND I'LL BURY YOU
THERE.

1010
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:31,960
OK.

1011
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:33,960
LET'S GO.

1012
00:52:35,970 --> 00:52:36,970
COME ON. YAH!

1013
00:52:36,970 --> 00:52:38,470
COME ON.

1014
00:52:38,470 --> 00:52:39,970
WHOA.

1015
00:52:41,970 --> 00:52:42,970
WHOO!

1016
00:52:42,970 --> 00:52:44,980
SILVER CITY,
HERE I COME!

1017
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:46,980
AAAH!

1018
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:48,980
NO!

1019
00:53:21,010 --> 00:53:23,010
YAH!

1020
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:27,020
UGH!

1021
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:28,690
UHH!

1022
00:53:35,690 --> 00:53:37,690
SHIT.

1023
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:41,700
SHIT.

1024
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:44,700
SON OF A...

1025
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:51,710
I DON'T THINK SO,
DAVE.

1026
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:01,720
THAT MEXICAN-INDIAN
MAY HAVE LOST HIS FAMILY,

1027
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:03,720
BUT HE HADN'T LOST A TRICK

1028
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:05,720
WHEN IT CAME DOWN TO

1029
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:07,720
AN OLD-FASHIONED
PIG-STICKING MATCH.

1030
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:08,730
YOU WANT
YOUR KNIFE BACK?

1031
00:54:11,730 --> 00:54:12,730
SHIT.

1032
00:54:13,730 --> 00:54:14,730
YEAH.

1033
00:54:15,730 --> 00:54:16,730
AND DAVE...

1034
00:54:17,730 --> 00:54:20,740
WELL, HE APPRECIATED
THE VALUE OF FAIR PLAY,

1035
00:54:20,740 --> 00:54:22,740
BUT HE ALSO APPRECIATED
THE VALUE

1036
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:25,740
OF A GOOD BONE-HANDLED KNIFE.

1037
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:27,660
AND WE WERE GOINGAROUND
THAT CEMETERY,

1038
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:29,660
I PROMISE YOU.

1039
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:31,670
THANK YOU.

1040
00:54:59,150 --> 00:55:01,150
GARRETT!

1041
00:55:01,150 --> 00:55:03,160
GET ME OFF
THIS ANIMAL!

1042
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:05,200
I HAVE TO HAVE
A MOVEMENT!

1043
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:07,200
YOU HAVE TO HAVE
A WHAT?

1044
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,200
HE HAS TO HAVE
A SHIT.

1045
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,200
I HAVE TO HAVE
A MOVEMENT.

1046
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,710
THAT'S THE FOURTH ONE
TODAY.

1047
00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:14,250
AAAH!

1048
00:55:14,710 --> 00:55:17,250
SHERIFF, AT THE RISK
OF OFFENDING YOU,

1049
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:19,250
YOUR NEWSPAPERMAN
IS HINDERING

1050
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:20,710
AN IMPORTANT
GOVERNMENT OPERATION.

1051
00:55:20,710 --> 00:55:22,260
I HAVE TO REQUEST

1052
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:24,300
THAT HE BE DISCHARGED
FROM SERVICE.

1053
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:32,680
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT?

1054
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:34,270
TOBACCO POUCH.

1055
00:55:34,270 --> 00:55:36,270
IT'S HIS.
I GAVE IT TO HIM.

1056
00:55:36,270 --> 00:55:39,270
IT'S BUFFALO SCROTUM
FROM MY FIRST KILL,

1057
00:55:39,270 --> 00:55:42,280
BIG OLD BULL
NEAR FORT GRIFFIN.

1058
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:46,320
THAT'S A PRETTY STORY,
SHERIFF.

1059
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:49,330
WHY'D HE LEAVE IT
HANGING THERE LIKE THAT?

1060
00:55:49,330 --> 00:55:51,330
JUST TO SAY HELLO.

1061
00:55:53,710 --> 00:55:56,670
LOOKS LIKE HE'S SAYING
MORE THAN HELLO.

1062
00:56:13,730 --> 00:56:14,690
WHAT'S ''SCUM''?

1063
00:56:15,730 --> 00:56:16,690
WELL, TOM,
THAT'S BAD TYPES--

1064
00:56:17,730 --> 00:56:19,730
POLITICIANS, BANKERS,
CATTLE KINGS--

1065
00:56:19,730 --> 00:56:20,690
SCUM.

1066
00:56:21,730 --> 00:56:22,690
COME ON.

1067
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:33,660
COME ALONG, MOTHER.

1068
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:49,680
WELL, I'LL BE HOG-TIED
AND SENT TO HADES!

1069
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:50,680
BILLY!

1070
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:52,680
AHH!

1071
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:53,680
WHAT HAVE WE GOT HERE?

1072
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:55,680
HOW ARE YOU, JANE?

1073
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:56,690
WICKED BOYS!

1074
00:56:56,690 --> 00:56:59,690
4, 5, 6 WICKED BOYS.

1075
00:56:59,690 --> 00:57:03,690
WICKED AND WANTED
OR JUST PLAIN WICKED?

1076
00:57:03,690 --> 00:57:04,690
$1,OOO ON ME.

1077
00:57:04,690 --> 00:57:06,700
YEAH?
I HEARD $5OO.

1078
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:07,700
WELL, YOU HEARD
WRONG, JANE.

1079
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:11,700
I ALSO HEARD YOU AIN'T LONG
FOR THE TERRITORY, BILLY.

1080
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:14,700
WE'RE NOT. WE'RE GOING TO
OLD MEXICO, RIGHT, BILLY?

1081
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:16,710
WELL, GOOD LUCK.
HOW OLD'S THIS FELLA?

1082
00:57:16,710 --> 00:57:18,710
14 AND--

1083
00:57:18,710 --> 00:57:19,710
17.

1084
00:57:19,710 --> 00:57:21,710
14 1/2.

1085
00:57:21,710 --> 00:57:24,710
OH, WELL,
DON'T FORGET THAT HALF.

1086
00:57:24,710 --> 00:57:27,630
THERE'S A LOT OF EXPERIENCE
PACKED INTO THAT HALF.

1087
00:57:27,630 --> 00:57:29,640
IT'S DIFFERENT.

1088
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:31,640
WHAT? MY HAIR?

1089
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:32,640
IT'S THE NEW FASHION.

1090
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:34,640
YOU LIKE IT?

1091
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:36,640
YEAH, YOUR HAIR,
BUT EVERYTHING.

1092
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:38,640
THIS WHOLE TOWN,
OUTSIDE, TOO.

1093
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:39,650
THEY GOT A CHURCH.

1094
00:57:40,650 --> 00:57:41,650
THIS AIN'T
WHITE OAKS.

1095
00:57:41,650 --> 00:57:44,650
YEAH, WELL, THERE'S 2,011
SOULS IN THIS TOWN, KID,

1096
00:57:44,650 --> 00:57:46,650
A LOT OF BACK EAST MONEY.

1097
00:57:46,650 --> 00:57:49,660
THE TOWN'S DIFFERENT.
IT'S RESPECTABLE.

1098
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:51,660
YOU'RE NOT TELLING US
YOU'VE GONE RESPECTABLE

1099
00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:53,660
NOW, JANE, HAVE YOU?

1100
00:57:53,660 --> 00:57:56,660
NO. WELL, TO THE EYE
THAT DON'T KNOW NO BETTER,

1101
00:57:56,660 --> 00:57:57,660
YEAH, I HAVE.

1102
00:57:57,660 --> 00:58:00,670
WELL,
I'VE HEARD ENOUGH.

1103
00:58:00,670 --> 00:58:02,670
MY BOYS HERE WOULD LIKE
SOME BOONDA UPSTAIRS

1104
00:58:02,670 --> 00:58:04,670
RIGHT QUICK, DARLING.

1105
00:58:04,670 --> 00:58:06,670
DID I HEAR YOU SAY

1106
00:58:06,670 --> 00:58:07,670
YOU'D LIKE
AN EXCELLENT MALT

1107
00:58:08,670 --> 00:58:10,680
SIX-TIMES SERVED IN A ROOM
WITH A SOUTHERN VIEW?

1108
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:14,680
YOU'RE A LADY
TO THE MANOR BORN, JANE.

1109
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:17,720
TO THE MANOR BORN.

1110
00:58:22,690 --> 00:58:24,690
HE'S HURT PRETTY GOOD.

1111
00:58:24,690 --> 00:58:27,650
LOOKS LIKE THE MUSKRATS
ARE IN A TRAP.

1112
00:58:27,650 --> 00:58:30,240
THEY'RE CHEWING
THEIR OWN LEGS OFF.

1113
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,280
ALL RIGHT,
WE'RE GOING NORTH.

1114
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:33,660
SOUTH, YOU MEAN.

1115
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:35,280
NO, I MEAN NORTH.

1116
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:37,660
BUT, SHERIFF,
LAST TIME I HEARD,

1117
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:39,660
OLD MEXICO'S
STILL SOUTH.

1118
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:43,330
YOU EVER HEAR OF
A COYDOG, POE?

1119
00:58:43,330 --> 00:58:45,340
HALF COMMON DOG,
HALF COYOTE.

1120
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:46,670
FEED ONE, HE KEEPS
COMING AROUND.

1121
00:58:46,670 --> 00:58:47,670
NO FEAR OF MAN.

1122
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:49,340
KID'S A COYDOG.

1123
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:52,680
HE'S COME 15O MILES
WITHOUT A TOWN.

1124
00:58:53,390 --> 00:58:54,340
RIGHT ABOUT NOW,

1125
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:56,350
HE'S LOOKING FOR
SOME ATTENTION.

1126
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:00,390
ASH!

1127
00:59:00,390 --> 00:59:02,690
HE AIN'T MY CONCERN.

1128

[SPEAKING APACHE LANGUAGE]

1129
00:59:21,710 --> 00:59:24,500

[SPEAKING APACHE LANGUAGE]

1131
00:59:44,650 --> 00:59:47,520
SHERIFF, I THINK
I NEED TO HAVE A MOVEMENT.

1132
00:59:47,650 --> 00:59:49,650
ME, TOO.

1133
00:59:49,650 --> 00:59:50,650
