00:01:18,292 --> 00:01:19,589
Good day Mam

3
00:01:21,226 --> 00:01:22,021
Good day

4
00:01:25,593 --> 00:01:26,616
Who is she, Mike?

5
00:01:26,826 --> 00:01:27,757
I'm working on it

6
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,253
Fiona Birch

7
00:01:31,493 --> 00:01:35,017
Alias Fiona Nielson
born in London, England, 1978

8
00:01:35,226 --> 00:01:37,921
Wanted for murders in Spain
Brazil and United States

9
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,091
And here you're gonna like this

10
00:01:39,327 --> 00:01:41,293
It says here she was kidnapped from
her parents when she was...

11
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,617
She was 12 years old

12
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,317
Madame M likes to start them young

13
00:01:49,128 --> 00:01:51,287
I'm in the lobby. Where to now?

14
00:01:52,594 --> 00:01:53,719
Look to your right

15
00:01:54,495 --> 00:01:57,017
Take the VIP elevator up to 12th floor

16
00:01:57,661 --> 00:01:59,252
He's in 1238

17
00:02:11,261 --> 00:02:12,159
Hey guys

18
00:02:12,329 --> 00:02:13,295
What took so long?

19
00:02:13,529 --> 00:02:16,017
Nobody sells take away around here.
Cappuccino, right?

20
00:02:16,828 --> 00:02:17,590
Here you go, Mike

21
00:02:19,029 --> 00:02:21,688
Why don't you cut him some slack
He's new on the job

22
00:02:22,728 --> 00:02:25,218
To be a good agent Jack
you need to think fast

23
00:02:25,429 --> 00:02:27,293
It shouldn't take you twenty minutes
to get a cup of coffee

24
00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:29,419
Sorry, sir. Won't happen again

25
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,827
So why don't we just arrest her?

26
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:48,824
The point is to let her escape
so she brings us to Madame M

27
00:02:56,064 --> 00:02:57,189
I like her technique

28
00:02:58,563 --> 00:02:59,621
What technique?

29
00:02:59,831 --> 00:03:01,296
You know, like Mata Hari

30
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:05,060
She uses her incredible body to either
get the secret from the enemy

31
00:03:05,264 --> 00:03:05,821
Or...

32
00:03:05,997 --> 00:03:06,691
Or what?

33
00:03:06,931 --> 00:03:07,862
Or she'd kill you

34
00:03:17,565 --> 00:03:19,689
You wanna take your little
picnic outside Jack?

35
00:03:20,098 --> 00:03:20,859
Sorry, Mike

36
00:03:21,132 --> 00:03:22,189
You got something else to eat?

37
00:03:22,999 --> 00:03:24,430
Um, no

38
00:03:24,999 --> 00:03:26,589
I think I need a sandwich, Jack

39
00:03:27,365 --> 00:03:28,161
Now?

40
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:29,556
Yes now

41
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:37,728
Alright

42
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,432
Waiter?

43
00:03:47,667 --> 00:03:49,190
Can I have 2 croissant sandwiches please?

44
00:03:49,367 --> 00:03:50,162
Yes, sir

45
00:04:35,736 --> 00:04:36,497
Jill!

46
00:05:31,837 --> 00:05:32,769
Oh, shit!

47
00:06:28,974 --> 00:06:29,599
Oh, shit!

48
00:07:44,679 --> 00:07:45,906
May I join you?

49
00:07:48,311 --> 00:07:50,106
You are an amazing fighter

50
00:07:55,011 --> 00:07:56,478
Would you like to have this?

51
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,043
It's yours if you want it

52
00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:03,377
Go ahead and choose whatever you like

53
00:08:14,379 --> 00:08:15,106
I can take you to

54
00:08:15,379 --> 00:08:17,436
where all the best fighters go

55
00:08:17,913 --> 00:08:19,743
You can become one of them

56
00:08:20,846 --> 00:08:22,403
Do you want to come with me?

57
00:08:52,014 --> 00:08:53,480
Oh shit!

58
00:09:05,815 --> 00:09:09,509
October 11th
Another girl has been reported missing...

59
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:11,408
...bringing the total to 40

60
00:09:11,949 --> 00:09:14,744
Their ages are all around 13 years of age

61
00:09:14,948 --> 00:09:17,574
Although their nationalities
and family backgrounds vary

62
00:09:17,982 --> 00:09:20,778
it is interesting to note that
each of these girls...

63
00:09:21,016 --> 00:09:23,448
...excels in either martial arts or sport

64
00:09:23,949 --> 00:09:25,744
Ever since the Rome incident

65
00:09:25,949 --> 00:09:28,574
Madame M and her organization
have not resurfaced

66
00:09:28,749 --> 00:09:31,580
In the meantime, little girls are
disappearing all over the globe

67
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:37,640
Could it be... one female assassin dead...

68
00:09:38,183 --> 00:09:40,649
and dozens more being trained
to take her place?

69
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:47,813
If that's the case, I'm afraid
these girls will be scarred for life...

70
00:09:49,151 --> 00:09:50,378
and can never be helped

71
00:10:45,154 --> 00:10:46,744
This is your new home

72
00:10:47,054 --> 00:10:49,679
And these girls are your sisters

73
00:10:50,454 --> 00:10:52,113
I want to go home

74
00:10:53,621 --> 00:10:55,247
I want my mommy!

75
00:10:56,454 --> 00:10:59,182
For the time being
you can think of me as your mommy

76
00:10:59,387 --> 00:11:02,581
You are not my mommy
You can't tell me what to do

77
00:11:03,254 --> 00:11:04,413
Do you really want to go?

78
00:11:04,587 --> 00:11:05,417
Yes!

79
00:11:05,622 --> 00:11:08,247
I don't like it here and I don't like you!

80
00:11:08,689 --> 00:11:10,847
Alright, you can go now

81
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:12,554
Go

82
00:11:23,789 --> 00:11:24,720
Girls!

83
00:11:25,122 --> 00:11:28,519
I would love to officially welcome you
to a brand new world

84
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:32,622
Here every exercise
every meal and every class

85
00:11:33,322 --> 00:11:35,254
will be with one thing in mind...

86
00:11:35,456 --> 00:11:38,320
to create a team of world class fighters

87
00:11:39,589 --> 00:11:40,715
Is that clear?

88
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:42,517
Yes, sir!

89
00:11:43,257 --> 00:11:46,485
We are two hundred miles away from
the nearest island

90
00:11:46,856 --> 00:11:50,220
And if you try to run away,
you'll be shot

91
00:11:50,556 --> 00:11:51,647
Any questions?

92
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:53,014
No sir!

93
00:12:18,325 --> 00:12:19,291
Hi!

94
00:12:21,391 --> 00:12:23,823
You're the one who came in with me
today right?

95
00:12:24,092 --> 00:12:24,887
Yeah

96
00:12:25,191 --> 00:12:27,090
My name is Charlene, what's yours?

97
00:12:27,358 --> 00:12:28,290
Katherine

98
00:12:28,993 --> 00:12:30,583
I like the name, Katherine

99
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,015
Thank you

100
00:12:32,292 --> 00:12:34,485
Everybody, come! Come on!

101
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,582
I say we go now

102
00:12:41,793 --> 00:12:44,385
tonight,
as soon as they turn the lights out

103
00:12:44,592 --> 00:12:47,615
There's only one guard in the
tower and one on the pier

104
00:12:47,826 --> 00:12:51,122
If we can just get to that side
of the bay before they see us

105
00:12:51,325 --> 00:12:53,485
there's a boat we can use
to make our escape

106
00:12:53,694 --> 00:12:56,182
We'll have to row,
but it's our only chance

107
00:12:56,593 --> 00:12:59,354
I've seen that boat,
we can't all fit in it

108
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,720
I didn't think everyone
here has the guts to go

109
00:13:02,926 --> 00:13:04,825
Alright. So who's in?

110
00:13:05,061 --> 00:13:06,788
Raise your hands if you want to go

111
00:13:11,428 --> 00:13:13,723
What are you doing?
I want to go with them

112
00:13:13,994 --> 00:13:15,291
You won't make it

113
00:13:45,862 --> 00:13:48,692
Ready. First ready position!

114
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:51,426
First!

115
00:13:51,463 --> 00:13:54,156
1 , 2...

116
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:55,862
Change sides

117
00:13:56,096 --> 00:13:58,926
1 , 2. OK

118
00:13:59,663 --> 00:14:02,458
1 , 2...

119
00:14:14,497 --> 00:14:16,157
I'm too tired, Katt

120
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:19,661
Don't stop. Keep going, Charlene!

121
00:14:20,798 --> 00:14:22,627
Look, it's Ann-Marie, Renee

122
00:14:22,831 --> 00:14:23,728
And Susan

123
00:14:26,998 --> 00:14:28,191
Come on, keep going!

124
00:14:28,432 --> 00:14:29,659
Move your ass. Go!

125
00:14:29,964 --> 00:14:32,294
You people are barbaric. Go! Go! Go!

126
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:50,993
Move! Move! Go!

127
00:14:51,366 --> 00:14:53,389
Go! Keep going!

128
00:14:53,633 --> 00:14:55,258
Come on! Go! Go!

129
00:14:55,965 --> 00:14:57,488
Come on, move your ass!

130
00:14:58,066 --> 00:15:00,793
Use your legs. Use your arms. Go! Go!

131
00:15:02,966 --> 00:15:04,523
Come on go!

132
00:15:06,367 --> 00:15:07,196
Attack!

133
00:15:59,935 --> 00:16:01,459
The centraI nervous system

134
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:05,795
and the delivery of electric pulses
from the brain to the rest of the body

135
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:09,365
depends almost entirely on
your skeleton network

136
00:16:09,602 --> 00:16:12,227
and in particular the spinal column

137
00:16:13,104 --> 00:16:16,433
Remember what I said about
detaching the C-5 vertebrate

138
00:16:16,704 --> 00:16:18,260
It cuts the nerve cortex

139
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:20,299
instantly paralyzing your victim

140
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:23,826
Death by suffocation normally follows

141
00:16:38,604 --> 00:16:41,229
Keep your back straight. Your head still

142
00:16:41,538 --> 00:16:45,732
Wiggle your hip. Now stop here
And you pose

143
00:16:46,771 --> 00:16:47,895
Turn

144
00:16:50,105 --> 00:16:53,037
Stop. And turn

145
00:17:29,274 --> 00:17:31,705
Today's lesson. Working through pain

146
00:17:32,473 --> 00:17:34,598
To be a fighter, to be a killer

147
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,898
you must learn how to work with
the elements

148
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,863
I don't care if you are wet...

149
00:17:40,774 --> 00:17:42,239
or if you are freezing

150
00:17:42,441 --> 00:17:44,066
Your environment is your friend

151
00:17:44,873 --> 00:17:46,066
It's your only friend

152
00:18:37,343 --> 00:18:38,809
The water is so nice

153
00:18:40,477 --> 00:18:42,908
I was sitting at the bottom
of the ocean Katt

154
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:45,405
It was so peaceful

155
00:18:50,211 --> 00:18:52,836
Have you ever thought that
we would have to kill someone

156
00:18:53,144 --> 00:18:54,167
That we don't even know?

157
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:57,042
I don't dare to

158
00:18:59,678 --> 00:19:03,735
It's not up to you,
this is our fate together

159
00:19:04,211 --> 00:19:05,677
We can't run from it

160
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,167
I know I can't do it

161
00:19:09,111 --> 00:19:10,168
Well...

162
00:19:10,478 --> 00:19:13,274
We'll make a lot of money
for our lives from it

163
00:19:13,579 --> 00:19:15,010
We cannot help to do it

164
00:19:17,712 --> 00:19:18,939
Come on, let's go

165
00:19:32,846 --> 00:19:34,540
This is not an exercise

166
00:19:34,847 --> 00:19:38,244
Today's mission is to kill
a group of enemy soldiers

167
00:19:38,846 --> 00:19:41,937
They are all armed and ready to attack

168
00:19:42,213 --> 00:19:44,042
They will not show any mercy

169
00:19:44,413 --> 00:19:46,936
You have to fight for your survival

170
00:19:47,247 --> 00:19:49,338
Good luck ladies

171
00:20:00,448 --> 00:20:02,141
Let's go! Let's go!

172
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:57,708
Are you alright?

173
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:04,838
Look, we knew from the very beginning
what this is all about

174
00:21:05,783 --> 00:21:07,772
And eventually we would have to kill

175
00:21:09,452 --> 00:21:11,543
We're just an experiment to her

176
00:21:11,784 --> 00:21:15,546
That's all. Survival of the fittest

177
00:21:16,384 --> 00:21:18,441
Everything we're learning here...

178
00:21:18,651 --> 00:21:20,344
is what we're gonna need out there

179
00:21:20,551 --> 00:21:22,313
I know that. But today...

180
00:21:22,852 --> 00:21:25,249
today just makes me feel worse about
everything

181
00:21:25,452 --> 00:21:26,748
Forget about today

182
00:21:27,418 --> 00:21:29,043
Think about our future

183
00:21:30,318 --> 00:21:32,216
That's what I use to do as a kid

184
00:21:33,386 --> 00:21:35,409
Then Madame showed up and saved me

185
00:21:42,552 --> 00:21:45,315
You were awesome out there hanging
upside down from that tree and shit

186
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:48,349
Snap. Man, you should teach me that
sometime

187
00:21:48,753 --> 00:21:49,650
Here let me help you

188
00:21:52,053 --> 00:21:54,177
Hey you're tense.
You should relax a bit

189
00:21:54,519 --> 00:21:56,782
If there is anything, just ask
I can help you

190
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:21,213
Man, did you see me today?

191
00:22:21,455 --> 00:22:22,614
That fucker tried to sneak up on me

192
00:22:22,855 --> 00:22:24,081
But I was really for that shit

193
00:22:24,354 --> 00:22:25,979
It felt so good to kill him

194
00:22:27,188 --> 00:22:28,154
Hello?

195
00:22:32,688 --> 00:22:34,450
When I first came here

196
00:22:35,255 --> 00:22:36,948
I had a boyfriend back home

197
00:22:38,322 --> 00:22:41,617
We use to ride our bikes
everyday after school

198
00:22:43,089 --> 00:22:46,886
My first memory is cleaning up
around the boxing ring

199
00:22:47,789 --> 00:22:50,584
I tried to stay away
from such a lifestyle

200
00:22:50,789 --> 00:22:53,482
and finally
I chose to fight in the ring

201
00:22:53,923 --> 00:22:56,048
You and I are so different, Katt

202
00:22:57,457 --> 00:23:00,082
And yet I can't imagine
my life without you

203
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:14,679
Listen up. Here is your assignment

204
00:23:15,024 --> 00:23:18,421
Kill the nearest girl and
bring her body outside

205
00:23:18,857 --> 00:23:21,517
Anyone who isn't outside
in 2 minutes...

206
00:23:21,725 --> 00:23:22,917
will be shot

207
00:23:34,025 --> 00:23:35,252
Wait, this is so stupid

208
00:23:35,491 --> 00:23:36,514
Why are we killing each other?

209
00:23:36,925 --> 00:23:38,720
Because there are ten guys
waiting outside with M16s

210
00:23:38,925 --> 00:23:41,221
If we refuse there is
no way she can kill us all

211
00:23:41,424 --> 00:23:44,085
There isn't time for this.
We have our orders

212
00:24:49,528 --> 00:24:52,789
Congratulations ladies.
You are the survivors

213
00:24:53,328 --> 00:24:55,522
You show your courage and your strength

214
00:24:55,729 --> 00:24:57,991
in every imaginable situation

215
00:24:58,662 --> 00:25:00,525
Take a good look around you

216
00:25:00,762 --> 00:25:03,353
These girls are not
your friends anymore

217
00:25:03,695 --> 00:25:06,594
Only one of you will survive
tomorrow's exercise

218
00:25:07,563 --> 00:25:08,824
Who will that be?

219
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:11,325
Get some sleep, ladies

220
00:25:11,629 --> 00:25:14,288
Tomorrow is graduation day for
one of you

221
00:25:27,063 --> 00:25:28,460
This is bullshit!

222
00:25:28,663 --> 00:25:31,222
The whole thing was bullshit
from day one!

223
00:25:38,197 --> 00:25:40,356
I was wondering when it
would come to this

224
00:25:42,364 --> 00:25:44,523
Tomorrow is just another exercise

225
00:25:45,131 --> 00:25:46,188
That's it

226
00:25:48,864 --> 00:25:52,297
Katt, if we have to face each other

227
00:25:53,231 --> 00:25:55,027
Promise me you won't hold back

228
00:26:02,498 --> 00:26:03,794
Get some rest

229
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:30,428
Today is the day. One of you
will earn the right to survive

230
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,725
Some of you may feel that
I have treated you unfairly

231
00:26:34,934 --> 00:26:37,729
In fact, I'm afraid that I
might have protected you...

232
00:26:37,967 --> 00:26:41,865
too much from the harsh reality of
the world outside

233
00:26:46,134 --> 00:26:48,827
All of you will soon be given a number

234
00:26:49,667 --> 00:26:52,190
Girl number 1 enters the cage first

235
00:26:52,667 --> 00:26:56,328
She faces girl number 2
in a fight to death

236
00:26:57,102 --> 00:26:59,727
The survivor must then face
two more girls

237
00:27:00,001 --> 00:27:01,933
number 3 and 4

238
00:27:03,134 --> 00:27:05,897
The winner then faces
three more girls

239
00:27:06,102 --> 00:27:08,159
Number 5 to 7

240
00:27:09,535 --> 00:27:11,558
But that's not fair!

241
00:27:12,035 --> 00:27:14,661
That's right. Life isn't fair

242
00:27:14,901 --> 00:27:16,299
You're sending us to our death

243
00:27:16,869 --> 00:27:18,892
Maybe, but an assassin knows...

244
00:27:19,103 --> 00:27:22,865
the path to your own mortality
is only a footstep away

245
00:27:23,069 --> 00:27:25,694
What if girl number 1 survives
the first three rounds?

246
00:27:25,936 --> 00:27:29,630
If she survives, she'll have to fight
the last four girls

247
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:31,097
One on four

248
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:34,993
The fighting is over when
only one of you remains

249
00:27:35,536 --> 00:27:38,263
Behind you is a box containing numbers

250
00:27:38,902 --> 00:27:41,529
Choose one and accept your fate

251
00:27:45,537 --> 00:27:47,798
I want out of here. I don't want to die!

252
00:27:48,037 --> 00:27:49,502
You have no choice

253
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:52,135
All you can choose is your weapon

254
00:27:54,038 --> 00:27:55,697
Oh look, we're in the same group!

255
00:27:55,938 --> 00:27:56,835
We can be like a team

256
00:27:57,071 --> 00:27:59,263
I watch your back, you watch mine

257
00:27:59,537 --> 00:28:00,867
It's a win-win situation!

258
00:28:04,739 --> 00:28:07,102
From the moment I realized that
I was an orphan

259
00:28:08,138 --> 00:28:09,865
I knew I didn't have future

260
00:28:15,205 --> 00:28:19,298
Charlene, if I die in this cage tonight

261
00:28:19,705 --> 00:28:21,500
you have to remember me

262
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:40,536
We will always remember each other

263
00:28:47,473 --> 00:28:49,064
Charlene, don't be stupid!

264
00:28:49,372 --> 00:28:51,498
She took my number.
I'm supposed to go first!

265
00:28:52,074 --> 00:28:54,198
There is only one rule
inside the cage

266
00:28:54,741 --> 00:28:57,366
No matter what method you use
to kill your opponent

267
00:28:57,774 --> 00:29:00,035
you cannot leave, you cannot surrender

268
00:29:00,307 --> 00:29:02,102
You have no friends, no support

269
00:29:02,507 --> 00:29:05,167
All you can believe in is yourself

270
00:29:06,641 --> 00:29:08,607
Today you fight until you die...

271
00:29:08,874 --> 00:29:10,863
or until you are the last survivor

272
00:29:18,042 --> 00:29:22,168
It's all very simple, ladies.
Live or die

273
00:29:22,508 --> 00:29:24,701
Do not disappoint me

274
00:29:26,174 --> 00:29:28,232
We've been friends for six years

275
00:29:28,576 --> 00:29:30,064
I don't want to kill you

276
00:30:44,645 --> 00:30:47,475
Maybe now you understand survival of
the fittest...

277
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:49,839
and the need to eliminate the weak

278
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,110
Kill her! Kill her!

279
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:11,904
Shut up!

280
00:31:12,147 --> 00:31:12,805
Get off me!

281
00:31:44,582 --> 00:31:46,104
Charlene, are you alright?

282
00:31:58,249 --> 00:31:59,374
Oh my god!

283
00:32:09,183 --> 00:32:10,409
You have to win

284
00:32:12,382 --> 00:32:14,849
I will for both of us

285
00:32:15,784 --> 00:32:16,977
Don't quit on me

286
00:32:17,884 --> 00:32:20,372
If we join forces,
we'll be invincible

287
00:32:20,584 --> 00:32:21,879
Nobody can touch us

288
00:32:28,518 --> 00:32:30,347
I am invincible

289
00:33:26,954 --> 00:33:28,715
You have no chance!

290
00:34:21,456 --> 00:34:22,819
Don't kill her

291
00:34:24,923 --> 00:34:25,946
Please

292
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:36,520
Stop!

293
00:34:38,124 --> 00:34:39,181
That's it!

294
00:34:39,758 --> 00:34:40,984
Bravo, girls!

295
00:34:41,657 --> 00:34:43,815
What a terrific performance

296
00:34:44,224 --> 00:34:46,746
You have exceeded my expectations

297
00:34:47,158 --> 00:34:49,283
I have decided to break my own rules...

298
00:34:49,492 --> 00:34:51,515
and keep all three of you

299
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:21,556
I'm glad we can finally sit down and
have dinner together

300
00:35:21,859 --> 00:35:23,985
Let's do this more often in the future

301
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:28,852
To be honest with you ladies
I'm still in shock about the other day

302
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,853
It was never my plan to keep three of you

303
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:33,386
But I'm glad that I did

304
00:35:33,926 --> 00:35:34,984
Let's have a drink

305
00:35:36,494 --> 00:35:37,551
Cheers

306
00:35:40,926 --> 00:35:43,654
Jing, taste your wine...

307
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:45,451
and tell me the year and the labeI

308
00:35:52,027 --> 00:35:54,618
Petrus, 1971

309
00:35:55,961 --> 00:35:57,985
Katt, your's?

310
00:36:04,361 --> 00:36:07,350
Vega Sicilia, 1985

311
00:36:07,994 --> 00:36:09,756
Hmmm. Good

312
00:36:10,028 --> 00:36:10,891
Charlene?

313
00:36:15,995 --> 00:36:17,120
It's table wine

314
00:36:17,395 --> 00:36:18,451
Very good

315
00:36:18,862 --> 00:36:20,521
You ladies know your wine

316
00:36:21,629 --> 00:36:22,617
In a month

317
00:36:22,829 --> 00:36:25,022
you'll leave here with new identities

318
00:36:25,796 --> 00:36:28,387
You will be making more than
five million dollars a year

319
00:36:28,963 --> 00:36:29,553
Soon

320
00:36:29,796 --> 00:36:32,921
you'll become three of the most
wanted women in this world

321
00:36:33,563 --> 00:36:37,188
In five years our contract be over

322
00:36:37,597 --> 00:36:41,359
You can stay working for me or
you can go free

323
00:36:44,398 --> 00:36:46,954
Are you okay?

324
00:36:47,264 --> 00:36:50,423
I feel weak. She poisoned us

325
00:36:56,864 --> 00:36:58,296
Now. I've only given you...

326
00:36:58,564 --> 00:37:00,757
a mild sedative to help you relax

327
00:38:04,601 --> 00:38:08,124
After today your body
no longer belongs to you

328
00:38:09,534 --> 00:38:12,262
It is now your greatest weapon

329
00:38:12,467 --> 00:38:13,092
You must be willing...

330
00:38:13,335 --> 00:38:16,630
to do anything to please a man
no matter how vile

331
00:38:17,068 --> 00:38:19,898
Because a man's happiest moment...

332
00:38:20,168 --> 00:38:22,100
is also his weakest

333
00:39:38,305 --> 00:39:39,531
Okay, let's go

334
00:39:43,372 --> 00:39:46,770
This way, this way

335
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:48,698
He's waiting for you

336
00:42:06,179 --> 00:42:09,805
Yes more... please more

337
00:42:10,513 --> 00:42:15,036
More...

338
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:21,043
Do you know why you are here?

339
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,107
To please you

340
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:26,805
You are the most unusual young woman

341
00:42:27,446 --> 00:42:28,912
I'm glad you think so

342
00:42:29,214 --> 00:42:32,009
I'm sure my cousin thought the same thing...

343
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:34,637
before you killed him

344
00:43:29,717 --> 00:43:31,047
Charlene, hurry!

345
00:43:59,718 --> 00:44:01,048
This is great, there's no way out!

346
00:44:02,018 --> 00:44:03,677
Hurry! Help me block the door!

347
00:44:08,252 --> 00:44:10,047
Katt, we are stuck here!

348
00:44:10,218 --> 00:44:11,411
There's got to be a way out

349
00:44:13,085 --> 00:44:15,244
Don't worry, I'll get us out of here

350
00:44:17,552 --> 00:44:19,041
Forget it, it's over!

351
00:44:31,153 --> 00:44:31,982
Hurry!

352
00:44:38,086 --> 00:44:39,348
Go on. Hurry!

353
00:44:39,587 --> 00:44:42,417
No!
If this is it, we end it together!

354
00:44:42,653 --> 00:44:43,551
I won't leave you. I won't!

355
00:44:43,787 --> 00:44:44,775
Charlene listen!

356
00:44:45,087 --> 00:44:47,280
I promise
we'll see each other outside

357
00:44:47,653 --> 00:44:48,619
I promise!

358
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,986
I can't lose you...

359
00:44:52,788 --> 00:44:54,583
Go! Go!

360
00:44:58,187 --> 00:45:00,517
Please. Go!

361
00:46:49,332 --> 00:46:51,993
Based on the markings surrounding
the fractured vertebra

362
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:55,098
the coroner seems to think that
he was killed by a woman

363
00:46:59,266 --> 00:47:00,664
One of my first assignments was

364
00:47:00,899 --> 00:47:02,491
following a suspect
named Madeline Ho

365
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:03,927
a.k.a. Madame M

366
00:47:04,501 --> 00:47:07,591
Whoever did this ruptured the
central nerve with her bare hands

367
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:10,559
It's been six years since
I've seen a body like this

368
00:47:11,334 --> 00:47:13,562
Jack, there's something else
you should know

369
00:47:14,035 --> 00:47:15,625
The coroner found a blood sample
on the body

370
00:47:15,901 --> 00:47:17,491
which doesn't belong to the victim

371
00:47:18,501 --> 00:47:19,330
Run a DNA check

372
00:47:19,601 --> 00:47:21,328
and send the results over to
missing persons

373
00:47:22,467 --> 00:47:26,059
If my hunch is correct, Madame M
has decided to come out of her hole

374
00:48:25,904 --> 00:48:29,802
Charlene Ching. All these years
you've been missing

375
00:48:30,104 --> 00:48:31,501
What has happened to you?

376
00:48:32,305 --> 00:48:34,168
You must be a different person now

377
00:48:34,637 --> 00:48:36,501
But how much have you really changed?

378
00:48:53,039 --> 00:48:55,267
Please, goddess Tin Hau

379
00:48:55,839 --> 00:48:58,703
bless my only daughter Charlene

380
00:48:59,738 --> 00:49:02,534
I hope she has found peace...

381
00:49:02,739 --> 00:49:04,534
and joy in this world

382
00:49:21,906 --> 00:49:23,065
Back again?

383
00:49:23,673 --> 00:49:24,765
How are you?

384
00:49:25,074 --> 00:49:28,199
Don't worry, your prayers will be heard

385
00:49:28,707 --> 00:49:30,196
Goddess Tin Hau will send her blessing...

386
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:31,872
to you and your daughter

387
00:49:33,208 --> 00:49:36,004
I pray.
It is Tin Hau's wish...

388
00:49:36,241 --> 00:49:38,037
for me to see my daughter again

389
00:49:38,908 --> 00:49:39,771
Excuse me

390
00:49:54,675 --> 00:49:55,698
Mrs. Ching?

391
00:49:57,541 --> 00:49:59,098
Jack Chen, CIA

392
00:49:59,876 --> 00:50:01,240
What can I do for you?

393
00:50:02,176 --> 00:50:04,664
I came to ask you a few questions
about your daughter

394
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:05,864
Did you find her?

395
00:50:06,542 --> 00:50:08,474
Please tell me
that she's still alive

396
00:50:09,275 --> 00:50:11,606
There's been a series of murders
throughout Europe

397
00:50:11,944 --> 00:50:14,102
We think the killer is
a professional assassin

398
00:50:14,310 --> 00:50:16,435
DNA tests points to your daughter as
the killer

399
00:50:16,710 --> 00:50:17,902
That's impossible!

400
00:50:18,276 --> 00:50:20,764
How could my daughter
have become a killer?

401
00:50:21,976 --> 00:50:26,137
Six years ago, forty girls disappeared
at about the same time

402
00:50:26,543 --> 00:50:29,032
They're all trying to be
professional assassins

403
00:50:29,277 --> 00:50:30,606
We think Charlene is one of them

404
00:50:30,877 --> 00:50:32,240
My God...

405
00:50:35,544 --> 00:50:37,100
There's a good chance
your daughter may

406
00:50:37,344 --> 00:50:39,276
either be in Hong Kong
or on her way here

407
00:50:39,511 --> 00:50:41,739
If that's the case
she may try and contact you

408
00:50:42,411 --> 00:50:44,639
I hope I can count
on your cooperation

409
00:50:46,177 --> 00:50:50,042
You can't imagine the pain
a mother feels...

410
00:50:50,512 --> 00:50:52,410
when she loses her child

411
00:50:53,312 --> 00:50:54,902
I've put all that pain...

412
00:50:55,178 --> 00:50:56,575
and guilt behind me

413
00:51:00,579 --> 00:51:02,545
I'm sorry to put you
through all this

414
00:51:02,779 --> 00:51:05,244
But my job is to find a murderer
and that's what I intend to do

415
00:51:08,145 --> 00:51:13,602
Mr. Chen,
even if my daughter is a killer

416
00:51:15,079 --> 00:51:18,204
what makes you think I would help you
arrest her?

417
00:52:29,649 --> 00:52:30,580
Mrs. Ching?

418
00:52:31,382 --> 00:52:33,372
I thought I asked you
to leave me alone

419
00:52:34,183 --> 00:52:35,479
I want to help your daughter

420
00:52:36,016 --> 00:52:37,312
But I have to find her first

421
00:52:38,983 --> 00:52:41,040
Has she contacted you
in the last few days?

422
00:52:42,083 --> 00:52:44,140
Jack, first you tell me...

423
00:52:44,417 --> 00:52:46,247
my daughter is
a professional killer

424
00:52:46,684 --> 00:52:48,912
Now, you think I'm hiding her from
the law?

425
00:52:50,117 --> 00:52:52,275
Please, excuse me

426
00:53:59,287 --> 00:54:00,378
Go! Go!

427
00:54:40,989 --> 00:54:42,784
If you don't stop following me
I will kill you

428
00:54:44,023 --> 00:54:45,989
I've been on this case for six years

429
00:54:46,323 --> 00:54:47,550
How can I not follow you?

430
00:54:47,723 --> 00:54:50,120
That's your problem, Mr.
Not mine

431
00:54:50,723 --> 00:54:53,052
No, this is your problem

432
00:54:54,823 --> 00:54:55,948
Do you recognize her?

433
00:54:59,224 --> 00:55:00,315
Do you, Charlene?

434
00:55:02,857 --> 00:55:03,448
Let's go!

435
00:55:03,723 --> 00:55:04,814
Hurry!

436
00:55:14,991 --> 00:55:17,116
I'm arresting you
because I want to help you

437
00:55:17,424 --> 00:55:19,323
How can you shoot someone
in front of your mother?

438
00:55:19,959 --> 00:55:21,720
Do you think she actually forgot you?

439
00:55:22,391 --> 00:55:24,220
Don't you have any feelings at all?

440
00:55:25,024 --> 00:55:26,956
Do you want to live a normal life?

441
00:55:27,425 --> 00:55:29,220
I'm afraid you've got
the wrong person

442
00:55:29,658 --> 00:55:30,714
Charlene is dead

443
00:55:45,292 --> 00:55:46,815
Listen Charlene...

444
00:55:47,326 --> 00:55:49,656
or whatever you want
to call yourself...

445
00:55:49,926 --> 00:55:52,687
We're stuck here and it's cold...

446
00:55:53,426 --> 00:55:54,653
and to be honest

447
00:55:55,293 --> 00:55:57,884
I don't know how much longer
I can keep my arm up

448
00:56:15,093 --> 00:56:16,923
I knew you wouldn't kill me

449
00:56:18,227 --> 00:56:20,989
It's not that I can't.
I won't

450
00:56:21,228 --> 00:56:23,819
I'm a federal agent.
I'm here to arrest you

451
00:56:26,827 --> 00:56:28,487
Are you OK?

452
00:56:29,228 --> 00:56:30,388
Here

453
00:56:31,595 --> 00:56:32,720
Take my coat

454
00:56:41,661 --> 00:56:46,822
I've been looking for a lot of girls
who disappeared just like yourself

455
00:56:48,195 --> 00:56:48,820
Can you tell me...

456
00:56:49,095 --> 00:56:50,823
where you've been the past few years?

457
00:56:51,395 --> 00:56:53,554
Or who's been running the operation?

458
00:56:58,729 --> 00:57:02,991
Forget it...
I knew you wouldn't tell me

459
00:57:03,395 --> 00:57:04,656
But I'll find out

460
00:57:05,997 --> 00:57:08,292
I'll find out by myself.
I'll never give up

461
00:57:10,864 --> 00:57:13,352
Are you sure
you don't want your jacket?

462
00:57:13,663 --> 00:57:14,629
You look cold

463
00:57:17,396 --> 00:57:19,590
Don't worry about me.
I'm not cold

464
00:57:22,164 --> 00:57:23,494
I'm a man

465
00:57:27,797 --> 00:57:30,230
What? What's so funny?

466
00:57:31,497 --> 00:57:33,360
The metabolism of men...

467
00:57:33,564 --> 00:57:35,826
runs fifteen percent
faster than women

468
00:57:36,065 --> 00:57:38,656
So technically, men are more resistant...

469
00:57:38,931 --> 00:57:40,157
to the cold than women

470
00:57:43,866 --> 00:57:46,058
I don't know about you...
but I'm freezing

471
00:57:48,365 --> 00:57:49,990
Come here...

472
00:57:50,265 --> 00:57:52,128
we stand a better chance

473
00:57:52,365 --> 00:57:55,593
If we do like the Eskimos
and combine our body heat

474
00:57:59,432 --> 00:58:00,659
Come on

475
00:58:29,567 --> 00:58:31,090
You're a good guy...

476
00:58:31,434 --> 00:58:32,525
you know that?

477
00:59:20,970 --> 00:59:22,959
Case 538, day five

478
00:59:23,270 --> 00:59:25,929
Despite the lack of cooperation
from the local branch

479
00:59:26,170 --> 00:59:28,432
my investigation continues to progress

480
00:59:29,037 --> 00:59:31,901
I am watching the mother of one of
the China Doll assassins

481
00:59:32,170 --> 00:59:35,568
Hopefully, I wrap things up before
anyone else gets killed

482
00:59:36,170 --> 00:59:38,636
For the moment, my only lead is
Charlene Ching

483
00:59:38,871 --> 00:59:40,303
I believe Charlene was...

484
00:59:40,971 --> 00:59:46,801
she said the most amazing thing in that
ice-cream truck...

485
00:59:47,837 --> 00:59:49,598
she's lucky I gave her my jacket

486
00:59:51,570 --> 00:59:53,434
What am I saying?

487
01:00:04,806 --> 01:00:06,567
Even if I have to do it on my own

488
01:00:06,806 --> 01:00:08,499
I will solve this case

489
01:00:10,138 --> 01:00:13,036
Jack Chen, agent 75394

490
01:00:13,239 --> 01:00:14,398
signing out...

491
01:00:15,772 --> 01:00:18,204
...while officially on sick
leave in Hong Kong

492
01:00:23,539 --> 01:00:24,596
Mommy!

493
01:00:24,839 --> 01:00:26,066
Once I'm all grown up...

494
01:00:26,339 --> 01:00:29,170
and well trained in martial arts
I'll protect you...

495
01:00:29,406 --> 01:00:31,031
and beat up all the bad guys

496
01:00:57,908 --> 01:00:59,033
Charlene?

497
01:01:21,475 --> 01:01:22,566
No!

498
01:01:24,009 --> 01:01:25,998
help...

499
01:01:27,043 --> 01:01:27,804
Freeze!

500
01:01:27,977 --> 01:01:30,169
Don't move! Drop your weapon!

501
01:01:32,009 --> 01:01:32,940
Shit!

502
01:02:26,512 --> 01:02:28,102
Charlene...

503
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:30,908
Take her and get out of here!

504
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:32,702
Use your gun!

505
01:02:33,912 --> 01:02:35,401
I'm here to visit my mom
Why would I have a gun?

506
01:02:35,613 --> 01:02:36,442
Where's your gun?

507
01:02:37,578 --> 01:02:38,943
I dropped it

508
01:03:55,916 --> 01:03:56,644
Watch out!

509
01:04:12,451 --> 01:04:13,849
Mommy, I'm sorry...

510
01:04:14,018 --> 01:04:16,279
I'm sorry I wasn't here
to protect you

511
01:04:17,351 --> 01:04:20,283
I am the one who is sorry

512
01:04:21,718 --> 01:04:23,616
Seeing you alive...

513
01:04:25,452 --> 01:04:28,077
God has answered my prayers

514
01:04:31,918 --> 01:04:33,145
You're going to be fine

515
01:04:34,751 --> 01:04:36,012
There's a hospital nearby

516
01:04:36,986 --> 01:04:38,111
I'll carry her

517
01:04:39,952 --> 01:04:42,349
She's losing a lot of blood.
Put some pressure on the wound

518
01:04:42,585 --> 01:04:43,448
Don't tell me what to do

519
01:04:43,685 --> 01:04:44,878
Let's just get her to the hospital!

520
01:04:47,619 --> 01:04:50,347
Jack...

521
01:04:51,353 --> 01:04:52,875
She's trying to find a Jack Chen?

522
01:04:53,186 --> 01:04:54,083
That's me

523
01:04:55,086 --> 01:04:58,416
Please Jack, don't arrest my daughter

524
01:04:58,652 --> 01:04:59,983
I promise you, Mrs. Ching I won't

525
01:05:00,887 --> 01:05:01,750
Thank you

526
01:05:02,220 --> 01:05:04,209
Even if someday
you do have to take me in

527
01:05:04,586 --> 01:05:06,677
Jack? Is that your name?

528
01:05:07,087 --> 01:05:08,053
That's right

529
01:05:08,286 --> 01:05:10,548
I don't lie about my identity
like some other people

530
01:05:12,153 --> 01:05:14,483
I've known about you
for the past six years Charlene

531
01:05:14,687 --> 01:05:15,414
Look out!

532
01:05:17,454 --> 01:05:18,385
Thanks

533
01:05:19,887 --> 01:05:21,410
I'm just confused...

534
01:05:23,387 --> 01:05:24,217
I don't know anymore

535
01:05:24,455 --> 01:05:28,546
I don't know if I'm here for
professional or personal reasons

536
01:05:29,288 --> 01:05:30,583
Charity, I think?

537
01:05:31,154 --> 01:05:32,710
Goodness of your own heart?

538
01:05:48,256 --> 01:05:50,778
Don't worry. Your mom will be fine

539
01:05:51,788 --> 01:05:53,220
You really are a good guy

540
01:05:55,189 --> 01:05:56,280
What's the matter?

541
01:05:56,521 --> 01:05:59,454
The last time you said that
you hit me with your gun

542
01:06:08,589 --> 01:06:09,555
Here

543
01:06:10,623 --> 01:06:12,112
I know you'll be back for her

544
01:06:12,457 --> 01:06:14,855
And when you do,
I'm going to be here too

545
01:06:15,090 --> 01:06:16,021
I know, Jack

546
01:06:17,156 --> 01:06:18,122
I know

547
01:06:45,725 --> 01:06:48,385
What about the contract?
You can't see your mom

548
01:06:48,659 --> 01:06:49,885
They'll kill you both

549
01:06:50,559 --> 01:06:51,320
Trust me, Katt

550
01:06:51,525 --> 01:06:54,423
I know when to give life
and I know when to take it

551
01:06:59,459 --> 01:07:00,652
I'll make a deal with you

552
01:07:01,726 --> 01:07:03,487
Finish this one last job

553
01:07:03,959 --> 01:07:05,891
and we'll consider our contract over

554
01:07:07,192 --> 01:07:11,421
Besides, you wouldn't want any
more harm to come to your mother

555
01:07:11,627 --> 01:07:12,524
would you?

556
01:07:19,692 --> 01:07:21,885
Alright. I'll take it

557
01:07:22,427 --> 01:07:23,722
That's my girl

558
01:07:51,728 --> 01:07:52,853
Welcome, Madame

559
01:07:53,961 --> 01:07:56,086
allow me to introduce myself

560
01:07:56,728 --> 01:07:59,320
My name is Ryuichi

561
01:08:01,295 --> 01:08:02,886
You know the terms?

562
01:08:06,762 --> 01:08:10,217
As you require, 10%

563
01:08:10,730 --> 01:08:12,888
in crisp, unmarked bills

564
01:08:14,196 --> 01:08:16,957
There's a traitor
within my organization

565
01:08:17,329 --> 01:08:18,760
His name is Kenji

566
01:08:19,729 --> 01:08:21,195
You know what I want

567
01:08:22,063 --> 01:08:23,528
The thing is

568
01:08:23,763 --> 01:08:26,820
I would like to watch as he dies

569
01:08:27,063 --> 01:08:28,120
If you watch

570
01:08:28,363 --> 01:08:30,795
it's more work more money

571
01:08:33,597 --> 01:08:36,222
No one changes a deal on me

572
01:08:36,797 --> 01:08:39,524
Not now, not ever!

573
01:08:44,030 --> 01:08:44,927
Alright!

574
01:08:47,597 --> 01:08:49,995
Since you have the balls to ask for
more money

575
01:08:50,631 --> 01:08:52,097
I know you won't fail

576
01:08:53,031 --> 01:08:54,997
Your greed will not allow it

577
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:09,296
Ryuichi is meeting Kenji tonight
at a local disco

578
01:09:09,666 --> 01:09:12,530
Your Job is to kill Kenji before he escapes

579
01:09:12,798 --> 01:09:15,525
I'll be outside waiting
in case you need backup

580
01:09:39,533 --> 01:09:40,828
Shit! It's a trap!

581
01:09:42,066 --> 01:09:44,123
I'll see you in hell...

582
01:09:45,301 --> 01:09:46,994
You crossed the line, Madame

583
01:09:47,234 --> 01:09:48,358
just for a little money

584
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:51,489
Kenji doesn't even exist!

585
01:09:52,734 --> 01:09:55,291
That's what drives all the assassins

586
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:57,364
It's what brings you here tonight!

587
01:09:58,967 --> 01:10:00,433
My friend Carlos...

588
01:10:00,735 --> 01:10:04,428
was killed by a dancing female assassin

589
01:10:05,034 --> 01:10:06,863
Do you have any idea...

590
01:10:07,734 --> 01:10:10,167
how lonely I'll get without him?

591
01:10:12,768 --> 01:10:14,961
I bring you here because...

592
01:10:15,202 --> 01:10:18,759
I want you to suffer
as I know he suffered

593
01:10:20,003 --> 01:10:22,764
Ladies. Welcome to my nirvana!

594
01:10:26,535 --> 01:10:27,193
Run!

595
01:10:38,503 --> 01:10:39,627
As for the darts

596
01:10:40,370 --> 01:10:43,302
it's just a friendly
little aphrodisiac

597
01:10:43,503 --> 01:10:44,366
Run!

598
01:10:44,837 --> 01:10:47,496
You should already be feeling warm...

599
01:10:48,004 --> 01:10:48,867
and happy

600
01:10:55,371 --> 01:10:56,132
Hurry!

601
01:11:11,071 --> 01:11:12,559
You'll come for your friend!

602
01:11:13,404 --> 01:11:14,995
We'll see you at Pier 14

603
01:11:31,106 --> 01:11:31,969
Hello?

604
01:11:34,439 --> 01:11:35,370
Who is this?

605
01:11:38,438 --> 01:11:39,699
Charlene where are you?

606
01:11:50,339 --> 01:11:51,305
Charlene!

607
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:54,698
Charlene!

608
01:11:55,140 --> 01:11:56,003
Jack

609
01:12:00,307 --> 01:12:01,330
What happened?

610
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:04,133
Charlene! It's me, Jack

611
01:12:07,641 --> 01:12:08,800
Are you OK?

612
01:12:11,674 --> 01:12:12,935
What's wrong with you?

613
01:12:42,209 --> 01:12:43,732
Wait...

614
01:12:44,109 --> 01:12:46,132
No!
Stop...Stop...Stop

615
01:12:46,910 --> 01:12:48,136
What is going on?

616
01:12:48,342 --> 01:12:49,501
What's wrong with you?

617
01:12:50,609 --> 01:12:52,268
I...I was drugged...

618
01:12:52,909 --> 01:12:54,876
some kind of aphrodisiac...

619
01:12:56,210 --> 01:12:57,766
We need to calm down.

620
01:13:13,911 --> 01:13:15,001
Charlene!

621
01:13:18,544 --> 01:13:20,737
Charlene! Charlene!

622
01:13:25,511 --> 01:13:29,500
Charlene...

623
01:13:30,412 --> 01:13:31,877
Charlene!

624
01:13:44,245 --> 01:13:47,769
I'm here to catch Madame M and
her China Dolls

625
01:13:48,312 --> 01:13:50,505
Not take advantage of a young

626
01:13:50,712 --> 01:13:53,974
beautiful girl.
Not like this

627
01:13:56,113 --> 01:13:57,669
I could arrest her

628
01:13:58,479 --> 01:14:00,002
But now...

629
01:14:00,779 --> 01:14:02,369
What am I saying?

630
01:14:02,979 --> 01:14:05,377
I'm such an idiot!

631
01:14:05,914 --> 01:14:06,937
Jack?

632
01:14:14,546 --> 01:14:16,535
I just want you to know that

633
01:14:17,547 --> 01:14:19,604
actually I'm quite traditional

634
01:14:21,514 --> 01:14:23,241
I just want you to know...

635
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:24,937
it's okay

636
01:15:47,951 --> 01:15:51,714
Dear Jack, if I could live
my life over again

637
01:15:51,985 --> 01:15:55,610
I would love to be a normal girl
and have a normal life

638
01:15:55,919 --> 01:15:58,407
But I accepted my fate a long time ago

639
01:15:59,119 --> 01:16:01,914
What I am prevents me from being
a responsible daughter

640
01:16:02,151 --> 01:16:05,414
So Please, watch over my mother
until she gets well

641
01:16:06,419 --> 01:16:07,112
Maybe one day...

642
01:16:07,386 --> 01:16:10,511
fate will smile upon us and
we'll see each other again

643
01:16:11,419 --> 01:16:12,316
Charlene

644
01:16:16,986 --> 01:16:18,179
Every time

645
01:16:19,086 --> 01:16:21,677
just when I can reach out
and almost touch you

646
01:16:24,220 --> 01:16:25,549
you disappear

647
01:16:57,855 --> 01:16:59,878
Help me! Charlene!

648
01:17:00,121 --> 01:17:06,612
Help me... Help me... Charlene

649
01:17:07,855 --> 01:17:09,378
Help me...

650
01:17:09,622 --> 01:17:13,418
Oh Charlene... save me!

651
01:17:14,722 --> 01:17:19,018
Oh my God! Katt! ... Katt!

652
01:17:20,189 --> 01:17:22,347
Charlene...Charlene...Charlene

653
01:17:22,789 --> 01:17:25,017
You've finally come to save me

654
01:17:26,723 --> 01:17:29,553
It will be a pleasure to watch...

655
01:17:29,989 --> 01:17:35,012
as you and Ryuichi duel to the death

656
01:17:44,224 --> 01:17:45,553
Let her go, Ryuichi!

657
01:17:45,757 --> 01:17:47,655
I'm the one who killed Carlos, not her!

658
01:17:47,990 --> 01:17:50,650
I've finally figured out
how to play with my China Dolls

659
01:17:51,158 --> 01:17:54,180
It'd be nice if you girls came
with instructions, you know?

660
01:17:58,691 --> 01:17:59,657
Stop it!

661
01:17:59,858 --> 01:18:01,118
Katt!

662
01:18:01,691 --> 01:18:04,590
Please... kill me...

663
01:18:05,292 --> 01:18:07,315
But we made a promise, Katt!

664
01:18:07,525 --> 01:18:09,354
That we would always stay together

665
01:18:11,358 --> 01:18:15,381
Our time...is in the next life...

666
01:18:15,825 --> 01:18:20,416
Okay, it's time to say goodbye to
your friend

667
01:18:20,659 --> 01:18:21,454
Bye bye!

668
01:18:21,759 --> 01:18:22,588
No!

669
01:18:23,392 --> 01:18:24,221
Okay

670
01:18:24,558 --> 01:18:25,387
Ten seconds

671
01:18:28,992 --> 01:18:30,821
I love you, Charlene...

672
01:18:35,992 --> 01:18:36,855
and I will always...

673
01:18:36,892 --> 01:18:40,018
be with you.
Always...

674
01:18:46,027 --> 01:18:47,050
No!

675
01:18:49,827 --> 01:18:51,020
No!

676
01:18:51,594 --> 01:18:52,719
No!

677
01:19:31,129 --> 01:19:33,391
You and I are both driven...

678
01:19:33,628 --> 01:19:34,685
by vengeance

679
01:19:37,496 --> 01:19:39,190
Let's settle the score...

680
01:19:41,629 --> 01:19:44,322
using more primitive weapons

681
01:23:24,941 --> 01:23:26,372
You're beat up now

682
01:23:26,974 --> 01:23:28,530
You can't even see anymore

683
01:23:30,107 --> 01:23:32,800
I'm afraid our little duel
is just about over

684
01:23:35,408 --> 01:23:39,704
I have one chance left.
Will my strength fail me?

685
01:23:40,808 --> 01:23:41,966
Focus

686
01:23:42,274 --> 01:23:43,739
Focus on one thing...

687
01:23:44,341 --> 01:23:45,739
and everything

688
01:23:47,542 --> 01:23:49,269
feel the vibrations

689
01:23:49,875 --> 01:23:51,636
follow the energy...

690
01:23:53,342 --> 01:23:55,705
Visualize the stillness of water

691
01:23:56,541 --> 01:23:57,132
and let your heart...

692
01:23:57,408 --> 01:24:01,307
become water...

693
01:26:02,782 --> 01:26:05,111
I'm leaving tomorrow
have to go back to the States

694
01:26:05,714 --> 01:26:08,477
Whenever you have time
Please come and visit

695
01:26:09,182 --> 01:26:10,148
I'd like that

696
01:26:12,316 --> 01:26:15,941
You think this is just superstitious
nonsense, don't you?

697
01:26:17,015 --> 01:26:19,378
No. I was just thinking...

698
01:26:19,783 --> 01:26:21,976
the Chinese are so strong in beliefs

699
01:26:22,649 --> 01:26:24,877
You know I really never had a religion

700
01:26:25,482 --> 01:26:25,948
But somehow...

701
01:26:26,215 --> 01:26:29,443
this place makes me feel...peaceful

702
01:26:30,549 --> 01:26:32,607
If you like, you can make a wish

703
01:26:32,916 --> 01:26:34,814
Perhaps it will come true

704
01:26:35,617 --> 01:26:36,548
really?

705
01:26:37,050 --> 01:26:39,482
Try it. What have you got to lose?

706
01:27:39,986 --> 01:27:42,851
Please let Katt be filled
with joy and happiness

707
01:27:43,087 --> 01:27:45,450
And let her know
that I miss her very much

708
01:27:46,420 --> 01:27:50,443
Please make sure that certain someone
the guy I told you about...

709
01:27:50,687 --> 01:27:53,482
I wish the woman I love
is happy and safe

710
01:27:53,753 --> 01:27:55,310
And I pray that someday...

711
01:27:55,554 --> 01:27:57,815
I'll be able to tell her
how much I care for her

712
01:28:07,255 --> 01:28:08,880
No. 68

713
01:28:11,921 --> 01:28:14,443
Two with one mind will meet

714
01:28:15,121 --> 01:28:18,554
hand in hand playing music
and dancing

715
01:28:18,789 --> 01:28:20,414
I'm sorry I don't understand

716
01:28:20,722 --> 01:28:23,586
Very strange, a woman was here earlier

717
01:28:23,821 --> 01:28:25,844
She has the same fortune

718
01:28:26,788 --> 01:28:28,118
Was she looking for someone?

719
01:28:28,388 --> 01:28:29,285
Yes

720
01:28:29,888 --> 01:28:31,355
She said she was looking for...

721
01:28:31,588 --> 01:28:35,418
a man she met in a refrigerator

722
01:28:35,889 --> 01:28:37,048
Refrigerator?

723
01:28:37,388 --> 01:28:38,911
No, ice-cream truck

724
01:28:40,889 --> 01:28:41,786
Where is she?

725
01:28:42,090 --> 01:28:43,146
She just left

726
01:28:45,057 --> 01:28:45,920
Thanks!

727
01:28:53,456 --> 01:28:55,150
Call me superstitious

728
01:28:55,357 --> 01:28:58,754
but sometimes I think I can feel
Charlene's presence

729
01:28:59,290 --> 01:29:02,949
It's as if we're heading off
in the same orbit

730
01:29:03,656 --> 01:29:04,451
If we both stay on this path

731
01:29:04,790 --> 01:29:06,155
and don't stray

732
01:29:06,891 --> 01:29:08,516
we'll see each other again some day

733
01:29:09,624 --> 01:29:12,852
I can only hope that day
is sometime very soon

734
01:29:14,624 --> 01:29:19,852
