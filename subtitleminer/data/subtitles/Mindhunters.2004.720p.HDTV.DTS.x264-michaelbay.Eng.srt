1
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,715
How about I drive, huh?

2
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,913
Oh.

3
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,155
There we go.

4
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,312
About time you showed up.

5
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,271
Some couples like to talk.

6
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,351
Did they see anything?

7
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,557
They don't know the girls,
didn't see the car. Nothing.

8
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,115
How many more miles
do we have left to cover?

9
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,272
We're on Stone Hollow, and
we need to check these two roads

10
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,588
and circle back around.

11
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,752
Harris wants us back to base
by midnight, so...

12
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,513
Maybe the perimeter's
not wide enough. Maybe...

13
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,477
This guy's a traveler.

14
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,677
Maybe the first body
is throwing us off.

15
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,997
Your turn.

16
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,871
New paint, new plates.
It's our guy.

17
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,758
- He's here.
- Shit. Back in the car.

18
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,314
Let him think we're leaving.
We'll get tactical.

19
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,035
All units, this is Predator 5
requesting backup.

20
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,593
We're on Stone Hollow Road.

21
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,592
We have the UNSUB's vehicle...

22
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,397
They're still alive.

23
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,433
Come on.

24
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,069
FBI!

25
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,989
- Oh, God.
- Check the girls.

26
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,833
Sara!

27
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,192
Talk to me, Sara.

28
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,876
Predator 5 to base.
Over.

29
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,238
We have the situation secure.
Repeat... situation is secure.

30
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,197
Suspect is dead.

31
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,832
So are the girls.

32
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,751
There were three shots fired.

33
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,437
Hey!
Sara!

34
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,078
Sara, drop!
Get rid of the line!

35
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,434
Get down! Down!

36
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,435
Drop! Drop!

37
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,311
Ohh.

38
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:10,110
Man. Thought you guys
were never gonna get here.

39
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,434
Hey, Harris,
I'm fucking starving!

40
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,191
So, tomorrow...

41
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,959
I have a senior staff meeting
with the director,

42
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:47,272
A Q4 performance review,
and an academy course to prep.

43
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,319
But now, instead, I get to waste
my whole day at your funerals.

44
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,434
Special Agent Moore,
when is the situation secure?

45
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,516
- On the drive home.
- On the drive home.

46
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,353
That's right.
On the drive home.

47
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,078
- Sir, we didn't...
- Shut up.

48
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,356
Cigarettes on the table.
More at the door.

49
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,634
Different brands.

50
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,553
Two cars out front.
4 place settings, not 3.

51
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,517
All should have alerted you
to the possibility

52
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,154
that there might be
another suspect.

53
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,038
- I think...
- I'm sorry? What?

54
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,119
What did you say?

55
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,988
I think you enjoy
watching us fail, sir.

56
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,190
Better in here than out there.

57
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,673
You know this really happened?

58
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,836
The UNSUB was apprehended
in under 2 minutes

59
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,638
without a shot fired.

60
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,558
It took you guys 7 minutes,
and you killed your partner.

61
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,192
Have some cake.

62
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,958
The majority of murders
are committed

63
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,718
by someone known to the victim.

64
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:48,389
Those that are not solved within
the first 48 hours seldom are.

65
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,919
Not so with serial killers.

66
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,433
One advantage
in this line of work

67
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,512
is knowing that as long as
the UNSUB is out there,

68
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,238
you'll always have
another chance.

69
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,675
With each new killing comes
a resetting of the clock.

70
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,398
Time is on your side.

71
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,668
The model for this exercise

72
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,150
was a missing-persons search
in Buffalo, 1982.

73
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,437
The dead man was an accomplice
who was killed the day before.

74
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,317
The killer staged a suicide

75
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,039
in order to try, in effect,
an escape.

76
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:17,631
As you can see, some of you
responded better than others.

77
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,830
Well, exactly how many times
has a profiler

78
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,957
been in a kill-or-capture
situation since 1982?

79
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,871
Are you suggesting I'm
preparing you for something

80
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,990
you may never experience?

81
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,877
Success comes
when you understand

82
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,269
that your most lethal weapon
isn't your firearm,

83
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,550
but your brain.

84
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,756
A lot of the old guard
don't believe in my methods.

85
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,478
A lot of them think I'm crazy.

86
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,158
You're a privileged group.

87
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,356
You're all smart
or you wouldn't be here.

88
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,795
I just want you to be smarter.

89
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,668
Our final exercise will be
on the island of Oneiga.

90
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:53,672
This simulation will be a test
primarily of your teamwork.

91
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,711
I hope you're ready.

92
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,872
Then how could we have saved
the girls at the old hotel?

93
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:02,396
You couldn't. They were dead
no matter what you did.

94
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,040
What's the point
if we couldn't have saved them?

95
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,390
The point is to get used to it.

96
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,753
<i># There, you've seen it,
my behavior's unacceptable #</i>

97
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,195
Good evening, my fine,
young FBI friends.

98
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:19,558
I am a pretty little thing
just out of lit class at GMU.

99
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:23,269
Please note the Jimmy Joyce
in my Kate Spade.

100
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,750
My parents are loaded
as per my expensive ensemble.

101
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,553
And that "J"... Where is it?
On my key ring...

102
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:33,189
means I'm either a Jill
or a Jennifer.

103
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,350
Those being the favorite "J"
names of Beltway parents

104
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,954
circa 1981.

105
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,554
I like to hang with my friends
and have a good time,

106
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,872
but I'm really just a mature
woman looking for a mature man.

107
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,599
And I recently quit smoking.

108
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,111
Why do you say that?

109
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,515
You see the way she keeps eyeing
the guy next to her?

110
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,630
It's not him.
It's his cigarette.

111
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,392
Spoken like a woman who knows.

112
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,152
How long has it been, Nicole?
3 days?

113
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,156
The lovely Nicole
and her personal demons.

114
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,949
I'm surprised there's enough
room at the table for all of us.

115
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,639
Take me 5 minutes
to get her number.

116
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,551
Take me 2.

117
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,158
- You're on.
- Money's coming out.

118
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,309
$20.

119
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,152
- $20 works.
- Whoo!

120
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,593
Whoa, big money.

121
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,313
Hi. I think I know you,
don't I?

122
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,833
You're, um, uh...

123
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,273
Jill, right?

124
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,309
Jen.

125
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,233
Jen, Jen. Yes.
Yes, Jen, of course.

126
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,271
Okay, obviously
you don't remember me.

127
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,669
My name's Bobby.
Bobby Whitman.

128
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,432
Rafe, you're up.
Profile.

129
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,078
Okay.

130
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,993
Black suit, blond hair,
Martini.

131
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,274
I'm the sophisticated type

132
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,390
on the prowl for pretty,
young things.

133
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,755
Preferably blond.

134
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,475
Preferably a cheerleader
with great big...

135
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,869
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.
Enough.

136
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,671
Right about the blond.
You're on fire.

137
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,478
You're projecting.

138
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,153
I don't know. It was 2 seconds
at a lecture last semester.

139
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,389
GMU Lit Department, right?

140
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,510
The Moody lecture?

141
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,158
Yeah, yeah, Moody.
Heck of a writer.

142
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,309
Um...

143
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,595
I'm actually not even
a student myself.

144
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,039
Um...

145
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,799
I work in finance.

146
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,996
Oh. Finance?

147
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:17,038
- Oh! Right. Bobby.
- Yeah.

148
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,270
- Hi. How are you?
- Hi. I'm good.

149
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,788
He's got 15 seconds.

150
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,550
Thank you.

151
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:28,074
Lucas, looks like tonight
wasn't your night.

152
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,628
I know her. Her name's Jen.
I told her to play along.

153
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,914
You're full of shit.

154
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,274
You never know.

155
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,478
Ooh.

156
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:43,509
So, what is going on
in that head?

157
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,749
We're professionals.

158
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,831
We shouldn't have to put up
with Harris' shit.

159
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,275
All right, what's up?

160
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,714
I'm not making profiler.

161
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,119
I was alone in his office.

162
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,954
His recommends were on the desk,
and I read them.

163
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,996
We still have the weekend
at Oneiga.

164
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,513
He says I'm unfocused.

165
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,715
He says I'm not capable

166
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,514
of the psychological commitment
necessary for profiling work.

167
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,158
How do you like that?

168
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,391
Commitment. Like,
"Fucking look at me, man. "

169
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,357
Vince, I think...

170
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:17,238
You're not making profiler
either, Sara.

171
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,715
Sorry.
I read it.

172
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,550
Don't work too hard
out there, okay?

173
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,916
We've got a late addition.

174
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,230
This is Detective Gabe Jenson.

175
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,197
He's from the Philadelphia P.D.

176
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,759
Good morning.
How you doin'?

177
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,398
He's their resident profiler,

178
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,152
and somehow he got
on D. 0. J.'s good side

179
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,549
and convinced the attorney
general he could sit in

180
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,234
on some exercises
and see how I work.

181
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,356
Do I have the politics
about right?

182
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,634
Something like that.

183
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,869
He's joining the team?

184
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,718
He's just here to observe,
not to participate.

185
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,711
Now, be nice to him
or it's my ass.

186
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,949
No offense, Detective.

187
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,594
None taken. It's an honor
to meet all of you.

188
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,954
You want to do hostage rescue,
a smallpox outbreak,

189
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,359
this is the place.

190
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,470
Navy Seas built it
for wargame practice.

191
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,472
Once a year, they turn it over
to me for the weekend.

192
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,710
Okay, get your rappelling lines
and prepare to drop.

193
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,876
That's a joke.

194
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,679
Here we are.
Crimetown, USA.

195
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,796
Where all the residents
are dead.

196
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,632
Or about to be.

197
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,076
Now, the idea here, people,
is to only kill the bad guys.

198
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,829
But nobody's perfect.

199
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,673
It's nice
to hear you say that, sir.

200
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,876
It's like Beirut
meets Belfast.

201
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:17,111
Sir, I thought they didn't let
foreign nationals in the FBI.

202
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,668
Don't worry. On the inside
he's 100% American, right?

203
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,228
As American
as the death penalty.

204
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,355
That's my boy.

205
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,431
I think I'm in love.

206
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,796
Oh, there is one other person.
They'll be coming along shortly.

207
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,915
Who's that?

208
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,355
He's called a puppeteer.

209
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,556
He's killed two people
on these streets,

210
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,392
and he's about to kill a third.

211
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,118
Tomorrow you'll find
the crime scene

212
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,713
and receive
your background dossiers.

213
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:45,998
By O800 on Monday, I want
a full profile of this suspect.

214
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,031
I want to know who he is,
what he does,

215
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,957
and where he's gonna do it next.

216
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,833
I'm asking Special Agent Reston
to be team leader

217
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,552
unless you'd like to defer.

218
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,390
No, Harris.

219
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,591
I will solve whatever sick,
twisted crime scenario

220
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,755
you come up with.

221
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,955
I hope so.

222
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,673
What's the tank for?

223
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,518
The Navy uses it
to simulate Arctic regions.

224
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,160
That's what the nitrogen's for.

225
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,636
In general, if it says
"military," don't touch it.

226
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,710
Oh.
Great.

227
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,430
Navy humor.

228
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,109
The computers are loaded
with ViCAP,

229
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,479
but they're fully firewalled.

230
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,358
Don't do any research offsite.

231
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:34,433
If you want to do any
blood samples on the autorad,

232
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,472
analyze fibers...
scout samples...

233
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,909
It's all here.

234
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,116
You'll rest up here
till the morning.

235
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,475
Downstairs, there's
a fully stocked freezer,

236
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,312
bunks, and your showers.

237
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,436
Don't forget.
You're 50 miles offshore.

238
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:54,149
If you run out of toilet paper,
you are shit out of luck.

239
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,719
So, what's the point?

240
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,789
Sorry, Detective?

241
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,075
The island, the middle of
nowhere, they're professionals.

242
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,155
What's the point?

243
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,995
The point is that they're
isolated, alone, and forgotten.

244
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:08,755
That's what it's like to be
inside the mind of a sociopath.

245
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,878
Have you noticed it's
a really bad feeling here?

246
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,318
Good luck on your profile.

247
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,909
Go!

248
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,276
<i># It's gettin' hot #</i>

249
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,237
<i># It's gettin’ hot #</i>

250
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,356
<i># It's gettin’ hot #</i>

251
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,159
<i># It's gettin’ hot #</i>

252
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,710
<i># It's gettin’ hot #</i>

253
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,353
<i># It's gettin’ hot #</i>

254
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,158
<i># Come on, baby,
come on, baby #</i>

255
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,878
What?

256
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,349
He said dress for an island.

257
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,598
So, Detective,

258
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:21,116
what exactly did you do to earn
this island paradise?

259
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,191
Recommended for it.
Same as you.

260
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,190
Why, though?

261
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,555
Did you catch some killer
in Philly or something?

262
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,959
What's the deal?

263
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,474
You don't want to know
my war stories.

264
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,357
Well, actually, I do.

265
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,231
I mean, right now,

266
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,709
what do we know
about you for real?

267
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,950
We know he's got resentments
toward his parents,

268
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:42,316
as per the overload on tattoos
he's got there.

269
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,635
We know he's just out
of a bad relationship.

270
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,756
He's barely looked twice
at me and Sara.

271
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,354
Maybe you're not my type,
Nicole.

272
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,112
We're alone on an island.

273
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,515
Trust me, I'm your type.

274
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,429
We also know
he watches his words.

275
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,990
So that crossword's either
a sign of honing a talent

276
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,479
or correcting a deficiency.

277
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,476
What you say about me
doesn't tell you about me.

278
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,790
It tells me about you.

279
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,713
Now, I could say
your little gambling

280
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,995
means you have
an addictive personality.

281
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,149
I could say I know

282
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,913
you're sleeping with one
of the guys in this room.

283
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,076
I could say you take charge
of your team

284
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,958
because you never had a leader
in your own life.

285
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,314
And you.

286
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,397
When push comes to shove,
you crack under pressure.

287
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,948
Your partners can't depend
on you.

288
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,235
You don't belong here.

289
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,117
But that's all surface.

290
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,236
Psych 101 bullshit.

291
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,436
That's not who you are.

292
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,948
All for killing him
in his sleep?

293
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,713
<i># It's gettin’ hot #</i>

294
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,314
Bad for you... 1:45.

295
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,197
Damn!

296
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,911
You push me in,
I'll have your badge.

297
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:12,556
I, uh, came out here
to feed the ducks.

298
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,790
I see you're feeding the ducks.

299
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,030
Maybe we could feed the ducks
together.

300
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,433
Leave you alone?

301
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,078
No, no.
It's all right.

302
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,831
I don't smoke.

303
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,911
I know.
It's a gesture.

304
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,798
Goodwill, sympathy.
You know, the usual.

305
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,917
In lieu of knowing
what's going on.

306
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,878
He's not gonna let me
make profiler.

307
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,914
He thinks I can't get past it.

308
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,228
Is he right?

309
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:59,028
When I was a kid,
I lost both my parents.

310
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,111
Freak thing.

311
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,829
10 years old.
Bang. Mortality.

312
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,269
So I grew up living real hard.

313
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,033
Racing cars, smoking, drinking,

314
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,236
sleeping with any girl
I could find.

315
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,949
Real stupid,
dangerous lifestyle.

316
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,917
Then I turned 11, and...

317
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,350
All I know is this.

318
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,273
You don't confront your demons
and defeat them.

319
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,396
You confront them.

320
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,879
Then you confront them.

321
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,753
Then you confront them
some more.

322
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,836
Every single day.

323
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,513
You are seriously fucked up,
you know that?

324
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,909
You know what I hate
about you, J. D?

325
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,109
What?

326
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,555
You only want me for my mind.

327
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,433
What happened?

328
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,833
I'd like to know
how Harris got it here.

329
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,474
I'd say the issue is "why?"

330
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,831
Here, kitty kitty.

331
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:25,115
What kind of simulation is this?

332
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,994
Ah. Oh!

333
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,712
Ugh.

334
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,074
10:00.

335
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,230
That supposed to mean something?

336
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,756
So, what, is this supposed to be
some kind of warning sign?

337
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:48,072
Well, if I know Harris,
it's a sign of something.

338
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,797
It's 9:30 A.M.,
Saturday morning.

339
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,314
We're in search
of an unknown crime scene.

340
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,994
We'll split into pairs.

341
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,550
The first one who finds it wins
my eternal love and devotion.

342
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,039
And a dead cat.

343
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,117
And a dead cat.

344
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,200
Now, this place
must remind you of home.

345
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:18,192
Ha.
Happytown, USA.

346
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,429
Sst!

347
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,514
Look.

348
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,472
It's little Bobby.

349
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:30,028
Little Bobby's gonna grow up
to be big and strong

350
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,190
and pursue a career
in buried children

351
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,037
and dismembered mummies.

352
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:37,476
Now, that will make
Happytown proud.

353
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,034
I think you're
in the wrong line of work.

354
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,038
No, mate.

355
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,072
Not me.

356
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,515
Hey!

357
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,833
Dinner at Harris' house.

358
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,399
Pass the nuts.

359
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,912
Charming.

360
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,031
Great.
A cigarette machine.

361
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:11,310
Temptation is everywhere.

362
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,274
Hey, Agent, we searching
together or what?

363
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,079
Suit yourself.
I'm on vacation.

364
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,109
Hey, Vince!

365
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,077
Check out
the other side of town.

366
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,554
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

367
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,437
Huh.

368
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,359
Hey, everybody!

369
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,118
Harris, you are one sick
son of a bitch.

370
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,760
Stay on my 6.

371
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,037
Okay, everybody, it's about
that time to look alive.

372
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,795
We have victim.

373
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,831
Or victims?

374
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:57,236
We got a single victim.
Caucasian female.

375
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,197
25, 26.

376
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:02,795
The puppeteer.
That's a hell of a signature.

377
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:08,152
Why don't you check
the employee logs, receipts?

378
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,437
See who shopped here, who
worked here. That sort of thing.

379
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,829
Let me run forensic,
work the timeline.

380
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,950
Sara, why don't you check
the carcass?

381
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,155
Sara!

382
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,229
Sure.

383
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,509
Oh.

384
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,792
There's splatter
behind the counter.

385
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,189
The girl was definitely moved.

386
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,191
Any venture as to weapon?

387
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,555
- You want to take point on M.O?
- Absolutely.

388
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,676
Nic, not to step on your toes,

389
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:39,036
but I'm gonna bet
the guy's a trophy taker.

390
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,473
What are you smiling about?

391
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,869
If the taxpayers only knew...

392
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,514
I think I'll go see if the
UNSUB's still in the building.

393
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,068
Sweetheart, it's just
a simulation, yeah?

394
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:05,948
Where we're from, a site search
is called procedure.

395
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,433
Yeah?

396
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,514
We should have been allowed
to bring our guns.

397
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,352
It doesn't feel real
without my gun.

398
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,908
Hell, Vince,
how real do you want it?

399
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,317
<i># Welcome to puppet... #</i>

400
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,152
Don't move.
Don't move! Sara.

401
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,475
<i># Pull my strings,
it's time to play #</i>

402
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,556
Let's see what freak show
Harris has in mind.

403
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,672
<i># Surprises
at puppet playtime #</i>

404
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,557
It's no fun unless
it's a challenge, right?

405
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,758
<i># Hope you all enjoy
your stay #</i>

406
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,400
<i># Welcome to puppet... #</i>

407
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,309
Move!

408
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,349
Aah.

409
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,036
Aah!

410
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,269
My legs!

411
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,112
No!
Don't touch it!

412
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,155
Help!

413
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,559
It'll burn you!

414
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,232
- They're frozen!
- Help him!

415
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,197
Aah!
Aah!

416
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,997
Aah!
Stop!

417
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,837
This is a joke, right?

418
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:56,474
That was just a simulation.

419
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,151
I'm sorry, Nic.

420
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,873
- Were they working before?
- No signal, nothing.

421
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,990
What if it was
some kind of accident?

422
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,310
Someone killed J.D.
Don't you get it?

423
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,750
Someone is here on this island.

424
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,235
That wasn't there
last night either.

425
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,158
12:00.

426
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,559
It's an hour and a half.

427
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,596
It's a message.

428
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,836
What about the boat?

429
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:22,310
We saw that pier with the boat
when we flew in.

430
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,391
Watch your backs
and everyone else's.

431
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,959
Hit the boat and find the radio.

432
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,434
The simulation's over.

433
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,959
Now is not the time for fear,
people.

434
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,990
Now is the ti...

435
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,268
Shit.

436
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,319
- Sara!
- Ohh!

437
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,594
Sara!

438
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,432
Get her out of the water!

439
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,348
Help me get her
out of the water!

440
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,270
Get her out of the water!

441
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,191
Ugh!

442
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,310
It's okay.
You're okay.

443
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,958
Aah!

444
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,678
I'll handle it.
I'll handle it.

445
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,795
I've got her.

446
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,235
Back the fuck off!
I'll handle it!

447
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,393
It's okay.

448
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,119
You're out of the water,
all right? You're out.

449
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,428
Aah!

450
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,993
All right.
You're out of the water.

451
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,794
- You're okay.
- What's her thing with water?

452
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,077
I think I lost my smokes.

453
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:16,472
Harris brought us
to this island.

454
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,472
Now we're not allowed to leave.

455
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:22,199
Let's talk about this Harris.

456
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,191
Harris wouldn't do this.

457
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,629
You can say what you want,
but Harris is a company man.

458
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:30,036
Did anyone actually see him
get back in that chopper?

459
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,838
Oh, tell me
somebody witnessed that.

460
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:34,354
Maybe he got tired
of the simulations.

461
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,908
Missed the taste
of the real thing.

462
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,075
I'll give him a taste
of the real thing.

463
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,515
Did he just pull
that gun out of his arse?

464
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,115
We weren't supposed to
bring weapons.

465
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,878
My gun goes where I go.

466
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,793
If you get shot sometime,
maybe you'll understand.

467
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:54,440
You shouldn't have brought
your weapon, Vince.

468
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:57,189
You're gonna be glad I did.

469
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,158
Two square miles at most.

470
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,998
Hey.
Check this out.

471
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,789
Who wants to play
some hide-and-seek?

472
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,918
Anyone else is on this island,

473
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,997
Harris or worse,
we're gonna find them.

474
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:25,038
How's about your Navy?

475
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,270
They don't muck around, do they?

476
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,431
Damn cats.

477
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,908
Aah! Aah!

478
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,958
Oh, for the love of God,
just take the arm.

479
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:16,034
There. There.
That's the Lucas I know.

480
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:19,078
You want to get up
and do it all over again.

481
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,230
Are you all right?

482
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,548
Yeah.
I told you I'm fine.

483
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,073
Yeah, you told me, but...

484
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,116
As long as people aren't
asking me if I'm all right,

485
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,952
I'm all right.

486
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,590
So can I ask you
something else, then?

487
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,478
Anything else.

488
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,954
Well, since the end
may be near here,

489
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,237
have you kind of always
sort of had a thing for me?

490
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,157
Aah!

491
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,232
Is that a no?

492
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,110
20 minutes of 12:00.

493
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,634
So at 12:00
someone else is killed?

494
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,312
Somebody left those watches.

495
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,072
And left them
after Harris had gone.

496
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,594
Where is this killer?
We searched the island.

497
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,750
Somebody set that trap.

498
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,193
Somebody rigged that boat.

499
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,669
So what are we saying?

500
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,392
This is some kind of game?

501
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,790
Eeny, meeny, miney, mo.

502
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,990
Who's the next motherfucker
to go?

503
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,157
It's 12:00.

504
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,992
It's 12:00,
and we're still here!

505
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,150
We're still here,
and it's 12:00, and...

506
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,196
Shut up, Vince.

507
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,793
All right. Look.

508
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:42,155
We know that there
is a killer on the island.

509
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,276
Someone who knows
what we're here for,

510
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,952
someone who knows where we'd be.

511
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,917
There's just one problem.

512
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:51,316
There's no one
on the island but us.

513
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,872
Now, hold on.

514
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,392
Real slow.

515
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,431
Real easy like.

516
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,155
Let's all move our hands
away from our weapons.

517
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,511
- You get on the ground.
- Lucas.

518
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,956
I'm checking the rooms.
I find this... by his bed.

519
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:15,271
It's maps of the island,
the building, everything here.

520
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,032
Been doing some research
on the place?

521
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:19,918
- I can goddamn explain.
- You can get on the ground!

522
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:23,270
This is a military facility!
No one has access to this stuff!

523
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,197
Whoa.

524
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,395
You got me all wrong.

525
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,516
Oh, yeah, Detective?
They your maps?

526
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:37,910
I want to see
your hands up. Up!

527
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,039
You believe me.

528
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,429
- No one leaves this room.
- Since when is this room safe?

529
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,873
Since we're all in it.

530
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,797
On your knees now.

531
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,075
Now! Down!

532
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:01,830
Sara, can you feel your face?

533
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,753
Because I can't feel
your face...

534
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,877
Coffee.

535
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,552
Huh?

536
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,551
There's something in the coffee.

537
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,074
Ohh!

538
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:18,875
Ohh.

539
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,074
Ohh!

540
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,195
Hey, Nic...

541
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:27,989
Stay... away from...

542
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:49,039
You going somewhere?

543
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,193
Come here.

544
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,111
Sit down.

545
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,350
- Hey, man, I can explain.
- Shut up.

546
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,431
- Listen, I can explain.
- I said shut up!

547
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,919
You don't know
what you're doing.

548
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,075
You don't know who I am.

549
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,720
I know you killed J.D.
That's what I know.

550
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,313
Is everybody all right?

551
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,988
Sara.

552
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,351
Hey. Hey.
Sara.

553
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,556
Sara? Hey.

554
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:22,310
I just had the worst dream ever.

555
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,958
Come on.

556
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,758
Look.

557
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,832
If I'm the killer,
why didn't I run?

558
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,074
You were all lying here.
How come so am I?

559
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:36,152
Maybe it's a trick so you
can finish what you started!

560
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,310
Look, I'll tell you why
the maps were in the bedroom.

561
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,470
No! You tell us
what you put in the coffee!

562
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,711
- That's what you tell us.
- Hey! Who made it?

563
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,317
Did I make the coffee?

564
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,519
Sherlock Holmes
over there made it.

565
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,318
The man is calling you a killer.

566
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:53,113
Personally, I think you might
want to defend yourself.

567
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,956
Aah! Aah! Aah!

568
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,918
Oh, fuck!
Ohh!

569
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,992
Oh, fuck!

570
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,359
There's...

571
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,793
There's no blood.

572
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,552
Somebody...

573
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,756
drained his blood.

574
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,713
6:00.

575
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,756
Two watches.

576
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:40,310
Two watches means two victims?

577
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,270
We got 20 minutes.

578
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,197
All right.

579
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:50,237
Right. I want to know what
the next trap is.

580
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,197
And I want to know now.

581
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,674
I can't tell you
because I don't know!

582
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:56,637
You've been lying to us
since we got here.

583
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,358
That doesn't make me
the killer.

584
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,874
The dead people does.

585
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,315
How about the loner mentality?

586
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,197
How about the issues
with the FBI?

587
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:06,275
I'm not a cop.

588
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:08,590
I'm an investigator
with the Department of Justice.

589
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:11,069
I was sent to
investigate Harris.

590
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:13,628
The attorney general was hearing
rumors about his methods.

591
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:16,280
There was talk he was
pushing trainees too far.

592
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,669
The FBI investigates the FBI.

593
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,478
Not if you want it done right.

594
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,710
Look, they took him out
of the field for a reason.

595
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,597
Justice was talking
maybe that wasn't enough.

596
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:26,318
They sent me to see
how he works you.

597
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,709
The maps were prep.
It's a job!

598
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:30,193
Oh, this is not happening.

599
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:33,556
You want to hook me up to
a polygraph, hook me up!

600
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,551
Yeah, we know how to beat
a polygraph, too.

601
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:38,393
He's lying.
Watch his eyes.

602
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:42,438
I'm not lying.
I just don't like you.

603
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,951
Okay.
You got 15 minutes.

604
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,433
So tell us where the trap is,

605
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:50,074
or you never leave this room,
and I mean never.

606
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,593
Don't take your eyes off of him.

607
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,352
Okay.

608
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,756
Now, start talking.

609
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:04,875
It's a nine-number sequence
repeating itself.

610
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:06,433
Nine permutations.

611
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:08,033
What? A code?
A combination?

612
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:10,315
It has something to do
with time!

613
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:12,032
He has an obsession with time!

614
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,911
Forget the numbers.
We need to find the trap.

615
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,353
The numbers are the message.

616
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,476
What if it tells us
where the trap might be?

617
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:19,278
Fine. Bobby,
help her work the numbers.

618
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:21,032
I'm searching the building.

619
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,838
I'm searching with you.

620
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:26,635
10 minutes.

621
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:47,469
Phone number, Social Security
number, coordinates.

622
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:49,630
- Talk to me!
- Seven minutes.

623
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:52,758
Between you and me...

624
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:56,076
I'm not a violent person.

625
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,469
The thing I've learned
in my life is this.

626
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:01,398
Sometimes if you find yourself
feeling deep anger

627
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:02,799
and frustration

628
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:06,555
about where you find yourself,
what has happened to you...

629
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:10,397
The healthy thing to do
is to find an outlet

630
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,789
and let it all fucking go.

631
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:14,999
6:00.

632
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:18,072
One of us dies,
my outlet is you.

633
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,834
I am not your guy.

634
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:39,871
You don't want to do this, man.

635
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:43,433
You'll have to live
with what you don't know.

636
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,597
I think we're clear
on this level.

637
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,716
The obsession is time.
It has to do with time.

638
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,028
I know it.

639
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:53,032
5, 8, 2, 9, 9, 7, 9, 2, 4.
Whatisit?

640
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:54,109
Sara, it's no use.

641
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,594
8, 2, 9, 9, 7, 9, 2, 4, 5.

642
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:57,635
- What is that?
- Sara...

643
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:59,153
2, 9, 9, 7, 9...

644
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:02,471
It's a number!
It's a fucking number!

645
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:05,154
They're all just
fucking numbers!

646
00:46:16,970 --> 00:46:20,883
7, 9, 2... 4, 5, 8... 2, 7, 9.

647
00:46:20,970 --> 00:46:24,201
Anybody? Anyone?
What are we thinking here?

648
00:46:24,290 --> 00:46:25,848
What about a rate?

649
00:46:25,930 --> 00:46:28,205
When you factor in time,
an amount becomes a rate.

650
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:29,239
Or a speed!

651
00:46:29,330 --> 00:46:31,366
Yes. What kind of speed
do you measure in the millions?

652
00:46:31,450 --> 00:46:33,918
Atoms? Electrons?
How the hell should I know?

653
00:46:34,850 --> 00:46:36,203
Light.

654
00:46:40,450 --> 00:46:43,328
299 million...

655
00:46:43,410 --> 00:46:45,970
792,458
meters per second.

656
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:47,722
This is the original
measurement for light!

657
00:46:47,810 --> 00:46:49,004
And you know that?

658
00:46:49,090 --> 00:46:51,126
It's the basic principle
of physics.

659
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:52,848
Along with "Shit happens. "

660
00:46:52,930 --> 00:46:54,682
Turn them off.

661
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:56,044
The lights.
Turn them off.

662
00:46:56,130 --> 00:46:59,440
- What if that's the trap?
- It's about the light.

663
00:47:09,970 --> 00:47:11,642
What is that?

664
00:47:11,730 --> 00:47:12,640
What?

665
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:14,721
The back of your coat.

666
00:47:20,930 --> 00:47:22,682
It's on yours, too.

667
00:47:25,610 --> 00:47:27,885
He's marked us.

668
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:29,886
Letters.

669
00:47:31,690 --> 00:47:33,362
It's like a powder.

670
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:35,042
Put on us while we slept.

671
00:47:35,130 --> 00:47:37,166
"A"...

672
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:38,569
"O"...

673
00:47:38,610 --> 00:47:40,999
"R"...

674
00:47:41,090 --> 00:47:43,524
"T."

675
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:46,682
Tora? Rota? Roat?

676
00:47:48,370 --> 00:47:50,406
Otra?

677
00:47:50,490 --> 00:47:53,448
First it's numbers,
now it's letters.

678
00:47:55,690 --> 00:47:57,123
It's 6:00.

679
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:00,689
It just turned 6:90.

680
00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:08,123
Hey, who's out there?

681
00:48:08,210 --> 00:48:10,041
Anybody hear me?

682
00:48:20,016 --> 00:48:21,813
You're a dead man.

683
00:48:21,896 --> 00:48:24,364
You guys!
Down here!

684
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:33,804
Aah!

685
00:48:34,936 --> 00:48:36,528
Aah!

686
00:48:37,736 --> 00:48:39,294
Aah!

687
00:49:07,336 --> 00:49:08,735
Vince!

688
00:49:10,256 --> 00:49:11,735
Vince, listen to me.

689
00:49:11,816 --> 00:49:13,295
We've got to shut off
the power.

690
00:49:13,376 --> 00:49:15,446
Fuck you!
It's your trap!

691
00:49:15,536 --> 00:49:18,608
Oh, yeah, I'm so clever,
I'm about to kill myself.

692
00:49:18,696 --> 00:49:20,891
Man, there are circuit breakers
in that storeroom.

693
00:49:20,976 --> 00:49:23,444
Can you get there?
Can you reach it?

694
00:49:23,536 --> 00:49:24,889
Can you reach it?

695
00:49:27,416 --> 00:49:30,453
Look, I can, but you got to
give me your gun.

696
00:49:30,536 --> 00:49:31,730
I ain't giving you shit!

697
00:49:31,816 --> 00:49:34,808
Are you gonna hang on forever,
or throw me your gun?

698
00:49:34,896 --> 00:49:36,454
I'm gonna watch you die.

699
00:49:36,536 --> 00:49:39,050
Watch me die, and then what?
And then what?

700
00:49:45,336 --> 00:49:47,850
Come on! Please!

701
00:49:51,176 --> 00:49:52,609
Throw it!

702
00:50:59,776 --> 00:51:03,325
I'm losing my grip, Gabe.

703
00:51:05,016 --> 00:51:05,926
Ohh!

704
00:51:13,896 --> 00:51:15,215
Stairs.

705
00:51:25,856 --> 00:51:28,450
Oh, fuck.
I'm losing my grip!

706
00:51:29,896 --> 00:51:31,852
Come on, Gabe.

707
00:51:42,456 --> 00:51:44,924
Come on, Gabe!

708
00:51:45,016 --> 00:51:46,005
Come on!

709
00:51:52,816 --> 00:51:55,250
Vince, what's happening
in there?!

710
00:51:55,336 --> 00:51:58,408
Stay out of the water!
Stay out of the water!

711
00:52:05,136 --> 00:52:06,410
Where's that cop?!

712
00:52:10,616 --> 00:52:11,765
Vince!

713
00:52:11,856 --> 00:52:12,971
Aah!

714
00:52:15,576 --> 00:52:17,009
Lights out.

715
00:52:26,416 --> 00:52:27,565
I'm alive!

716
00:52:27,656 --> 00:52:29,248
Vince, what's going on?
Talk to me.

717
00:52:29,336 --> 00:52:30,849
I'm alive!

718
00:52:30,936 --> 00:52:32,051
Oh!

719
00:52:37,136 --> 00:52:38,171
Yes!

720
00:52:40,776 --> 00:52:41,731
You okay?

721
00:52:41,776 --> 00:52:44,973
I'm alive! I'm alive!

722
00:52:46,856 --> 00:52:49,495
He saved my life, Lucas.

723
00:52:51,536 --> 00:52:53,845
Still think you know me, Agent?

724
00:52:53,936 --> 00:52:55,574
Still think you know who I am?

725
00:53:00,176 --> 00:53:02,770
All right.
How do we turn off the water?

726
00:53:04,416 --> 00:53:07,214
Look, whoever did this
really knows his engineering.

727
00:53:07,256 --> 00:53:08,735
Remotes, timers.

728
00:53:08,816 --> 00:53:11,205
They teach this in first- year
with siege tactics.

729
00:53:11,296 --> 00:53:14,732
But to set this up fast, you
got to know what you're doing.

730
00:53:14,816 --> 00:53:17,614
Pressure plates,
radio detonators.

731
00:53:17,696 --> 00:53:21,166
It's all private- sector sold.
The wiring's the tricky part.

732
00:53:23,896 --> 00:53:27,969
People take specialty courses
in this sort of thing for years.

733
00:53:31,696 --> 00:53:33,175
Right.

734
00:53:36,976 --> 00:53:38,250
Thank you.

735
00:53:39,376 --> 00:53:40,934
You can all go to hell.

736
00:53:45,696 --> 00:53:47,288
Bobby!

737
00:53:49,936 --> 00:53:52,450
Look at me, look at me,
look at me!

738
00:54:11,096 --> 00:54:12,814
Two watches, two traps.

739
00:54:14,296 --> 00:54:15,934
Son of a bitch.

740
00:54:21,056 --> 00:54:23,092
So how about me, huh?

741
00:54:25,016 --> 00:54:27,211
How about me?!
Is it my fucking time?!

742
00:54:27,296 --> 00:54:29,446
Right here, right now!

743
00:54:29,536 --> 00:54:32,334
Who fucking wants it?!

744
00:54:32,376 --> 00:54:35,209
It was you who said
to turn off the water.

745
00:54:47,296 --> 00:54:50,094
Yeah, whatever
makes you feel better.

746
00:55:01,136 --> 00:55:02,455
Sara?

747
00:55:02,536 --> 00:55:06,654
I don't think any of us
should be alone right now.

748
00:55:06,736 --> 00:55:07,885
Okay?

749
00:55:10,496 --> 00:55:12,691
Nic found another watch.

750
00:55:18,096 --> 00:55:20,132
We've got an hour and a half.

751
00:55:21,856 --> 00:55:23,494
So what's with the jackets?

752
00:55:23,576 --> 00:55:26,249
If it's a message,
what's the order?

753
00:55:26,336 --> 00:55:28,008
The order we're dying in?

754
00:55:28,096 --> 00:55:30,894
J.D., Rafe, Bobby.
Which letters were theirs?

755
00:55:30,976 --> 00:55:32,807
That wouldn't work.
These were traps.

756
00:55:32,896 --> 00:55:34,409
They could've killed
any one of us.

757
00:55:34,496 --> 00:55:37,647
How about the order
we signed up with the bureau?

758
00:55:37,736 --> 00:55:39,010
Who here had seniority?

759
00:55:39,056 --> 00:55:40,774
J.D., then Bobby.

760
00:55:40,816 --> 00:55:42,090
- Then me.
- Then me.

761
00:55:42,176 --> 00:55:44,770
Cro...

762
00:55:46,096 --> 00:55:49,088
Atone?

763
00:55:49,136 --> 00:55:53,254
Crotone?

764
00:55:53,296 --> 00:55:56,254
Crotone, Croato, Croa...

765
00:55:56,336 --> 00:55:57,849
Might as well pick them
at random.

766
00:55:57,936 --> 00:55:59,608
Croatoan.

767
00:55:59,696 --> 00:56:03,371
Like the island, the colony.

768
00:56:04,696 --> 00:56:05,924
Do you know where we are?

769
00:56:06,016 --> 00:56:08,928
Near the Outer Banks
of North Carolina?

770
00:56:09,016 --> 00:56:10,210
It's one of the first sites

771
00:56:10,296 --> 00:56:13,686
settled by the Europeans
in the New World.

772
00:56:13,776 --> 00:56:16,768
In the 16th century,
there was a ship of settlers

773
00:56:16,816 --> 00:56:18,693
who landed right around here,

774
00:56:18,776 --> 00:56:21,927
sent to colonize
the place for England.

775
00:56:21,936 --> 00:56:25,895
They built their town
on Roanoke Island.

776
00:56:25,936 --> 00:56:28,769
Over 100 people.

777
00:56:28,816 --> 00:56:31,649
Two years later,
a supply ship sailed in...

778
00:56:31,696 --> 00:56:34,927
only to find
that the colony had vanished

779
00:56:35,016 --> 00:56:37,325
without a trace.

780
00:56:37,416 --> 00:56:41,614
No bodies, no papers,
no evidence of anything.

781
00:56:43,336 --> 00:56:46,294
Over 100 people.

782
00:56:46,376 --> 00:56:48,128
Gone.

783
00:56:49,416 --> 00:56:52,852
And the only thing left
was a single word

784
00:56:52,936 --> 00:56:55,370
found carved in a tree.

785
00:56:56,456 --> 00:56:58,048
Croatoan.

786
00:57:00,496 --> 00:57:01,975
What was Croatoan?

787
00:57:02,056 --> 00:57:03,535
Some said a body of water.

788
00:57:03,616 --> 00:57:05,652
Others said an Indian tribe.

789
00:57:05,736 --> 00:57:09,012
Point is, is 500 years later,

790
00:57:09,096 --> 00:57:11,769
we still don't know
where those people have gone.

791
00:57:11,856 --> 00:57:13,812
That's the message.

792
00:57:15,656 --> 00:57:17,772
An island full
of people vanish forever.

793
00:57:17,856 --> 00:57:19,574
And it happened here.

794
00:57:19,656 --> 00:57:22,454
The killer isn't after the FBI.

795
00:57:22,536 --> 00:57:24,891
He's after infamy.

796
00:57:26,856 --> 00:57:28,892
It troubles me
that you know this story.

797
00:57:28,976 --> 00:57:31,774
It'd trouble you more
if I didn't.

798
00:57:33,376 --> 00:57:35,936
All right, we know method,
we know motive.

799
00:57:36,016 --> 00:57:40,567
All that's missing now
is where he made his mistake.

800
00:58:23,496 --> 00:58:24,815
Got something.

801
00:58:38,416 --> 00:58:39,849
We've got blood.

802
00:58:39,936 --> 00:58:41,767
Under Rafe's nails.

803
00:58:41,856 --> 00:58:45,132
He struggled with the killer.
We got to run it past autorad.

804
00:58:46,416 --> 00:58:48,566
What are you staring at?

805
00:58:48,656 --> 00:58:50,055
Time.

806
00:58:56,536 --> 00:58:58,208
Somebody know how this works?

807
00:58:58,296 --> 00:59:00,685
I do. We can have
a DNA match in under an hour.

808
00:59:00,776 --> 00:59:03,051
We've only got
less than an hour.

809
00:59:03,096 --> 00:59:06,247
We'll need blood comparisons
from each of us...

810
00:59:06,296 --> 00:59:08,935
unless anyone
has a problem with that.

811
01:00:02,376 --> 01:00:04,526
God, I want a cigarette.

812
01:00:04,616 --> 01:00:06,049
You and me both.

813
01:00:08,456 --> 01:00:10,811
You're a gambling man,
aren't you, Lucas?

814
01:00:10,896 --> 01:00:12,215
Who would you put
your money on now?

815
01:00:12,296 --> 01:00:14,048
Not sure my money
would go anywhere different.

816
01:00:14,096 --> 01:00:15,734
We just about died down there.

817
01:00:15,816 --> 01:00:18,011
You didn't know
you'd be down there.

818
01:00:18,096 --> 01:00:19,768
What do you do?
Not help Vince?

819
01:00:19,856 --> 01:00:21,369
We're gonna trust you then?

820
01:00:21,456 --> 01:00:23,287
I'll trust you when you're dead.

821
01:00:23,376 --> 01:00:25,890
Well, let me enlighten you. You
know there's a bomb on a boat.

822
01:00:25,976 --> 01:00:28,365
You don't run toward it
first in line.

823
01:00:28,456 --> 01:00:29,650
I don't.
Maybe you do.

824
01:00:29,736 --> 01:00:32,011
Enough!

825
01:00:47,576 --> 01:00:49,214
Guns on the table.

826
01:00:49,296 --> 01:00:50,570
Everybody.

827
01:01:03,536 --> 01:01:05,970
I'm not giving up my gun.

828
01:01:06,056 --> 01:01:09,048
I think I speak for the group
when I say, "That would be bad. "

829
01:01:09,136 --> 01:01:12,446
I don't go anywhere
without my gun.

830
01:01:12,536 --> 01:01:16,324
I'll give up my wheels first.
I'll give up my chair.

831
01:01:16,376 --> 01:01:19,607
I'm not giving up my gun.

832
01:01:19,696 --> 01:01:20,970
You got it!

833
01:01:26,576 --> 01:01:28,168
Hit the damn thing.

834
01:01:28,256 --> 01:01:29,484
Hit it!

835
01:01:37,096 --> 01:01:38,211
On the ground.

836
01:01:38,256 --> 01:01:39,245
Nic, wait.

837
01:01:40,256 --> 01:01:42,212
Nic, it's not me.
It's a mistake.

838
01:01:42,256 --> 01:01:44,372
On the ground, damn it!

839
01:01:44,456 --> 01:01:46,253
I will waste you, Sara.

840
01:01:46,296 --> 01:01:48,491
You want to kill me, huh?
You want to kill me?

841
01:01:48,576 --> 01:01:51,295
- Situation secure, Nic.
- That's what Harris says, right?

842
01:01:51,376 --> 01:01:53,731
The situation is secure
on the drive home.

843
01:01:53,816 --> 01:01:54,931
Ugh!

844
01:01:57,776 --> 01:01:59,812
Lower your weapon, Agent.

845
01:02:06,216 --> 01:02:09,731
Lucas, Lucas.
It's not me, Lucas.

846
01:02:09,816 --> 01:02:11,488
Tell them.

847
01:02:11,536 --> 01:02:12,730
It's not me.

848
01:02:13,736 --> 01:02:15,613
It don't make sense.
Why her?

849
01:02:16,576 --> 01:02:18,726
Because she
wasn't gonna make it.

850
01:02:19,896 --> 01:02:22,285
She wasn't gonna make profiler.

851
01:02:22,376 --> 01:02:24,367
Saw the recommends myself.

852
01:02:26,176 --> 01:02:27,734
Neither were you, Vince.

853
01:02:27,816 --> 01:02:31,729
But I never had someone
in my family get murdered.

854
01:02:31,816 --> 01:02:36,048
No kid sister of mine
ever got drowned and raped,

855
01:02:36,136 --> 01:02:41,005
drowned and raped
over and over and over.

856
01:02:41,096 --> 01:02:44,088
Who knows what
that would do to my head?

857
01:02:44,176 --> 01:02:46,485
You don't know.

858
01:02:46,576 --> 01:02:49,648
The FBI didn't save
your sister, Sara.

859
01:02:49,736 --> 01:02:52,569
And they didn't catch
her killer.

860
01:02:52,656 --> 01:02:55,648
So why should they be able
to catch you...

861
01:02:55,696 --> 01:02:58,688
when you're so much smarter
than everyone?

862
01:02:58,776 --> 01:03:00,448
I swear.

863
01:03:01,896 --> 01:03:05,689
It's not me.

864
01:03:05,776 --> 01:03:08,336
She wouldn't.
Not Sara.

865
01:03:08,416 --> 01:03:10,247
That's why she planned it
for the island.

866
01:03:10,336 --> 01:03:12,213
She wanted us dead
and underwater,

867
01:03:12,296 --> 01:03:13,968
so we'd suffer.

868
01:03:14,056 --> 01:03:16,047
You ever see the pictures?

869
01:03:16,136 --> 01:03:18,445
Fucking brutal.

870
01:03:20,936 --> 01:03:24,167
I swear on my life it's not me.

871
01:03:25,176 --> 01:03:27,485
Well, we can stay
in here and debate.

872
01:03:29,016 --> 01:03:31,576
But there's 10 minutes
till the trap.

873
01:03:35,416 --> 01:03:38,055
What is the trap?
Where is the trap?

874
01:03:38,096 --> 01:03:39,290
I don't know.

875
01:03:39,376 --> 01:03:41,094
What is the trap?
Where is the trap?

876
01:03:41,176 --> 01:03:42,404
I don't know.

877
01:03:42,496 --> 01:03:45,090
What is the trap?
Where is the trap?

878
01:03:45,136 --> 01:03:46,091
I don't know.

879
01:03:46,136 --> 01:03:47,854
What is the trap, Sara?!

880
01:03:51,736 --> 01:03:54,330
- You tell me.
- No, you tell me!

881
01:03:54,416 --> 01:03:57,328
What if she's telling the truth,
Nic? Think about it.

882
01:03:58,416 --> 01:04:01,135
This is what the killer wants.

883
01:04:01,176 --> 01:04:04,134
Suspecting each other,
fighting each other.

884
01:04:05,616 --> 01:04:07,208
This is what makes it fun.

885
01:04:07,296 --> 01:04:09,935
You in the killer's mind again?

886
01:04:10,016 --> 01:04:11,847
We were all knocked out.

887
01:04:11,896 --> 01:04:14,046
He could've taken blood
from any of us.

888
01:04:14,136 --> 01:04:16,889
- You could've taken blood...
- I'll take blood from you!

889
01:04:16,976 --> 01:04:18,375
Come off that!

890
01:04:23,376 --> 01:04:24,775
Nicole...

891
01:04:26,456 --> 01:04:27,889
Nicole...

892
01:04:31,776 --> 01:04:33,687
Nobody else is gonna get killed.

893
01:04:33,776 --> 01:04:36,244
You want to protect her?

894
01:04:36,336 --> 01:04:38,975
She's been playing you
from the start, Lucas.

895
01:04:39,056 --> 01:04:43,129
You come after me,
I will shoot you on sight.

896
01:04:44,936 --> 01:04:46,130
Nicole...

897
01:04:46,216 --> 01:04:48,889
we need to stay together.

898
01:04:48,976 --> 01:04:52,173
If I am by myself,
I know who to trust.

899
01:04:52,216 --> 01:04:53,615
- You go out there running...
- Back!

900
01:04:53,656 --> 01:04:55,055
Okay.

901
01:04:56,336 --> 01:04:59,806
You go out that door,
you don't come back in.

902
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:01,170
Why would I?

903
01:05:03,376 --> 01:05:05,287
Do your job.

904
01:05:06,896 --> 01:05:08,887
Put a bullet in her.

905
01:05:19,696 --> 01:05:21,129
Sara, put yourself
in our position.

906
01:05:21,216 --> 01:05:22,410
You're a professional.

907
01:05:22,496 --> 01:05:25,169
You have a prime suspect.
There are still lives at risk.

908
01:05:25,256 --> 01:05:26,655
What do you do?

909
01:05:27,976 --> 01:05:29,648
I don't fit the profile.

910
01:05:29,736 --> 01:05:31,852
Wouldn't you know
what not to fit?

911
01:05:34,656 --> 01:05:37,124
You say I kill for revenge.

912
01:05:37,216 --> 01:05:40,492
For my personal pain.

913
01:05:40,576 --> 01:05:43,693
That's not this killer.
This killer is impersonal.

914
01:05:43,776 --> 01:05:46,244
Deadlines, rules.

915
01:05:46,336 --> 01:05:48,770
They're ways
of proving superiority.

916
01:05:48,856 --> 01:05:50,812
She's right, Gabe.

917
01:05:50,896 --> 01:05:52,488
You know what else is right?

918
01:05:52,576 --> 01:05:55,215
They don't let killers
in the FBI.

919
01:05:55,296 --> 01:05:58,766
Playing hurt, playing wounded.

920
01:05:59,856 --> 01:06:01,608
Maybe that's her skill.

921
01:06:02,376 --> 01:06:04,492
We all have skills.

922
01:06:04,576 --> 01:06:07,534
Well, I say where there's
a skill, there's a weakness.

923
01:06:10,936 --> 01:06:12,688
We all have skills.

924
01:06:14,896 --> 01:06:16,045
Wait.
Let's think here.

925
01:06:16,136 --> 01:06:18,331
All along we've been assuming
the deaths have been random,

926
01:06:18,416 --> 01:06:20,054
that anybody
could walk into any trap.

927
01:06:20,136 --> 01:06:21,615
But look at the traps.

928
01:06:21,696 --> 01:06:24,130
J.D. dies because
he was out front, leading us.

929
01:06:24,176 --> 01:06:25,894
He was always out front.

930
01:06:25,976 --> 01:06:28,206
And Rafe.
Rafe's a coffee junkie.

931
01:06:28,296 --> 01:06:30,571
And Bobby. Who do we go to
to get something to work?

932
01:06:30,656 --> 01:06:31,725
Who's our Mr. Fix- it?

933
01:06:31,816 --> 01:06:34,330
You're saying he knew
who died, when?

934
01:06:34,416 --> 01:06:37,249
Knew it, planned it
through our characteristics,

935
01:06:37,296 --> 01:06:40,015
our skills, our weaknesses.

936
01:06:40,096 --> 01:06:43,611
All this time the killer's
been profiling us.

937
01:07:09,616 --> 01:07:10,651
Vince, who are you?

938
01:07:10,736 --> 01:07:12,294
What makes you different
from the rest?

939
01:07:12,376 --> 01:07:15,095
I don't know.
I mean, I know history.

940
01:07:15,176 --> 01:07:16,529
I do mazes.

941
01:07:16,616 --> 01:07:19,608
I'm in a goddamn chair.

942
01:07:19,696 --> 01:07:21,493
Lucas, how does he kill you?
Think.

943
01:07:21,576 --> 01:07:24,374
I'm our best shooter, best
driver. Those are my skills.

944
01:07:24,456 --> 01:07:26,526
And your weaknesses?

945
01:07:27,536 --> 01:07:30,334
I say I'm fearless, and I'm not.

946
01:07:30,416 --> 01:07:32,293
That leaves you, Sara.

947
01:07:33,896 --> 01:07:36,046
My sister was murdered.

948
01:07:36,136 --> 01:07:38,855
I haven't been
in the water since.

949
01:07:38,896 --> 01:07:40,568
I see her there.

950
01:07:41,536 --> 01:07:43,891
That's his signature.

951
01:07:43,976 --> 01:07:47,286
Oh, my God.
Nicole.

952
01:08:23,896 --> 01:08:25,454
Nicole!

953
01:08:46,896 --> 01:08:48,011
Jesus!

954
01:08:51,056 --> 01:08:52,330
No!

955
01:09:08,816 --> 01:09:10,807
She found herself
some cigarettes.

956
01:09:10,896 --> 01:09:13,205
They were laced
with some type of acid.

957
01:09:15,696 --> 01:09:17,971
- It's not her, Vince.
- Why?

958
01:09:18,056 --> 01:09:19,455
She figured out the pattern!

959
01:09:19,536 --> 01:09:22,846
So she saves herself.
Wouldn't you?

960
01:09:25,376 --> 01:09:26,809
I don't trust her.

961
01:09:28,136 --> 01:09:30,127
I don't trust any of you.

962
01:09:30,216 --> 01:09:32,969
Island fever. You got it.
He's got it. She's got it.

963
01:09:33,016 --> 01:09:35,132
And we're gonna ride it out
nice and friendly

964
01:09:35,216 --> 01:09:37,855
until somebody finds
another motherfucking watch.

965
01:09:40,296 --> 01:09:42,332
Are you having fun yet?

966
01:09:43,256 --> 01:09:44,689
I'm having fun.

967
01:09:44,776 --> 01:09:48,974
Harris. He's been watching us
all along.

968
01:09:49,816 --> 01:09:51,647
Did he know
you were from Justice?

969
01:09:51,696 --> 01:09:53,971
What if he figured out
he was being watched?

970
01:09:54,056 --> 01:09:54,613
No way!

971
01:09:54,696 --> 01:09:57,164
What if he knew they were gonna
take away his program?

972
01:09:57,256 --> 01:09:58,689
Is this what you wanted?

973
01:09:58,736 --> 01:09:59,771
I'm letting her go.

974
01:09:59,856 --> 01:10:02,211
Too bad you won't get
a chance to graduate.

975
01:10:02,296 --> 01:10:04,252
You're all so weak.

976
01:10:04,336 --> 01:10:05,735
Pathetic, powerless.

977
01:10:05,816 --> 01:10:07,215
You said
you searched the island!

978
01:10:07,296 --> 01:10:09,935
- Every corner of it!
- Every corner you could see?!

979
01:10:10,016 --> 01:10:12,405
You'll never be in control
no matter how hard you try.

980
01:10:12,496 --> 01:10:14,885
All right, he's out there.
Who's with me?

981
01:10:14,976 --> 01:10:17,536
Out there?
What do you think this is?

982
01:10:17,616 --> 01:10:20,926
This is a fucking trap. What
do you mean who's with you?

983
01:10:22,736 --> 01:10:24,533
I'll tell you who's with you.

984
01:10:25,936 --> 01:10:28,370
- I'm with you.
- Are you having fun yet?

985
01:10:28,456 --> 01:10:30,412
I'm having fun.
Are you having fun?

986
01:10:30,496 --> 01:10:32,612
You're all going out there?

987
01:10:32,696 --> 01:10:35,733
Look, I'm not going anywhere.

988
01:10:35,816 --> 01:10:37,693
You're right.
You stay put.

989
01:10:37,776 --> 01:10:39,812
What the fuck?

990
01:10:39,896 --> 01:10:41,295
What are you doing?

991
01:10:44,336 --> 01:10:46,850
Still think
that you're better than me?

992
01:10:51,336 --> 01:10:52,735
Hide.

993
01:10:52,816 --> 01:10:55,125
Don't tell me where.
Don't tell them where.

994
01:10:55,216 --> 01:10:57,047
Just do it till Monday.

995
01:10:57,136 --> 01:10:59,013
It's for the best.

996
01:11:04,696 --> 01:11:07,051
My fucking gun's empty!

997
01:11:11,856 --> 01:11:14,928
Is this real enough for you?

998
01:11:15,016 --> 01:11:17,450
You can't escape it.

999
01:11:17,536 --> 01:11:19,208
You can't stop it.

1000
01:11:20,896 --> 01:11:24,172
You can't turn it off.

1001
01:12:37,136 --> 01:12:40,014
We can do this
all night long.

1002
01:12:41,216 --> 01:12:44,925
I have all the time
in the world.

1003
01:12:44,976 --> 01:12:50,449
Still think
you are better than me?

1004
01:12:50,536 --> 01:12:53,494
Still think that the pupil
bests the teacher?

1005
01:12:53,576 --> 01:12:56,215
Is this what you wanted?

1006
01:12:56,296 --> 01:12:58,366
Is this what you expected?

1007
01:12:58,456 --> 01:13:00,970
Is this real enough for you?

1008
01:13:01,056 --> 01:13:03,126
You're all so weak.

1009
01:13:03,216 --> 01:13:04,808
Pathetic.

1010
01:13:04,896 --> 01:13:07,410
Too bad you won't get
a chance to graduate.

1011
01:13:07,496 --> 01:13:10,886
You'll never be in control
no matter how hard you try.

1012
01:13:10,976 --> 01:13:13,126
You always lose.

1013
01:13:13,216 --> 01:13:15,172
If you could only see yourselves
the way I see you.

1014
01:13:15,256 --> 01:13:17,611
Afraid, powerless.

1015
01:13:17,696 --> 01:13:20,529
Let me tell you what I think.

1016
01:13:20,616 --> 01:13:22,607
You look like you're having fun.

1017
01:13:22,696 --> 01:13:24,846
I'm having fun.

1018
01:13:24,936 --> 01:13:26,767
I don't want the fun to end.

1019
01:13:26,856 --> 01:13:30,007
I think they'll find you.

1020
01:13:30,096 --> 01:13:32,610
I don't want the fun to end.

1021
01:13:32,696 --> 01:13:34,254
Because I trained them.

1022
01:13:34,336 --> 01:13:37,214
You think you're smarter
than the rest of them?

1023
01:13:37,296 --> 01:13:38,729
Let me tell you what I think.

1024
01:13:38,816 --> 01:13:42,968
I think you
don't stand a chance.

1025
01:13:43,056 --> 01:13:45,809
You don't know who
you're dealing with, do you?

1026
01:13:45,896 --> 01:13:47,454
You don't know...

1027
01:13:47,536 --> 01:13:49,811
who you're dealing with, do you?

1028
01:13:49,896 --> 01:13:53,127
Come on, finish it.

1029
01:13:53,176 --> 01:13:55,644
Finish it, you selfish child.

1030
01:13:55,736 --> 01:13:57,089
Come on.

1031
01:14:01,616 --> 01:14:03,527
He never left.
He stayed to watch.

1032
01:14:03,616 --> 01:14:05,208
And the killer knew.

1033
01:14:09,576 --> 01:14:11,931
He's wearing watches.

1034
01:14:12,016 --> 01:14:14,007
Three watches.

1035
01:14:16,936 --> 01:14:18,608
What time are they set for?

1036
01:14:21,136 --> 01:14:22,967
They're set for now.

1037
01:14:23,056 --> 01:14:23,772
Aaah!

1038
01:14:23,856 --> 01:14:28,850
<i># Farewell
to puppet playtime... #</i>

1039
01:14:34,456 --> 01:14:37,016
<i>#... To puppet playtime #</i>

1040
01:14:37,096 --> 01:14:40,168
<i># Hope you all enjoyed
the show #</i>

1041
01:14:40,256 --> 01:14:42,008
Shut it off!

1042
01:14:51,536 --> 01:14:52,810
If it wasn't him...

1043
01:14:56,496 --> 01:14:58,168
No, wait!

1044
01:14:58,256 --> 01:14:59,769
That's a clever story.

1045
01:14:59,856 --> 01:15:02,131
Sent to spy on the program,
spy on Harris.

1046
01:15:02,216 --> 01:15:03,934
You're the one
who's telling stories.

1047
01:15:04,016 --> 01:15:05,165
I know it's not me.

1048
01:15:05,256 --> 01:15:07,053
And I know it's not me.

1049
01:15:07,136 --> 01:15:08,854
So it's not you.
It's not me. It's not her.

1050
01:15:08,936 --> 01:15:10,255
Who's that leave, mister?

1051
01:15:10,296 --> 01:15:12,571
That leaves
the last man standing.

1052
01:15:31,976 --> 01:15:34,092
Jesus Christ, Sara!
Watch out!

1053
01:15:34,176 --> 01:15:36,132
Watch out for fucking who?!

1054
01:15:54,776 --> 01:15:57,290
Stop shooting!
Stop shooting!

1055
01:15:57,376 --> 01:16:00,846
Sara! Sara, stay right
where you are!

1056
01:16:35,136 --> 01:16:37,809
That's the price you pay
for being fearless.

1057
01:16:59,936 --> 01:17:01,369
Sara?

1058
01:17:08,456 --> 01:17:10,412
Sara?

1059
01:19:45,376 --> 01:19:47,128
Close, God damn it.

1060
01:19:53,336 --> 01:19:56,055
Who wants off this island?!

1061
01:19:59,096 --> 01:20:00,131
You.

1062
01:20:52,536 --> 01:20:54,652
Never anywhere without a gun.

1063
01:20:56,576 --> 01:20:58,373
Back on schedule.

1064
01:21:02,136 --> 01:21:04,775
Guess we have answers now,
don't we, Sara?

1065
01:21:13,096 --> 01:21:17,571
Who are you?

1066
01:21:18,576 --> 01:21:20,612
You gonna panic now, Sara?

1067
01:21:21,736 --> 01:21:24,489
You gonna panic
when you've been so cool?

1068
01:21:26,416 --> 01:21:27,610
Oh.

1069
01:21:28,656 --> 01:21:30,487
What are you trying to prove?

1070
01:21:30,576 --> 01:21:32,487
What am I trying to prove?

1071
01:21:33,216 --> 01:21:36,014
How's a fucked- up girl like you
get into the FBI...

1072
01:21:36,056 --> 01:21:37,933
anyway?

1073
01:21:39,616 --> 01:21:41,413
How did I get in?

1074
01:21:42,336 --> 01:21:45,009
How did I get in?
Did you not get in, Gabe?

1075
01:21:45,096 --> 01:21:47,485
Did you try,
and they turned you away?

1076
01:21:47,576 --> 01:21:48,770
What did they tell you?

1077
01:21:48,816 --> 01:21:51,205
You're not sharp enough,
smart enough,

1078
01:21:51,256 --> 01:21:52,928
sane enough?

1079
01:21:54,336 --> 01:21:55,735
Panic.

1080
01:21:59,696 --> 01:22:00,970
Watch her panic.

1081
01:22:01,056 --> 01:22:04,651
Get your hands up.
I want to see your hands!

1082
01:22:05,576 --> 01:22:06,531
Boo.

1083
01:22:06,616 --> 01:22:09,608
You call yourself a profiler?

1084
01:22:09,696 --> 01:22:12,369
Show me your hands.

1085
01:22:12,456 --> 01:22:14,014
I'm the profiler.

1086
01:22:14,096 --> 01:22:16,690
I want to see your hands.

1087
01:22:20,336 --> 01:22:21,564
You're the victim.

1088
01:22:30,136 --> 01:22:31,171
Unh!

1089
01:23:09,296 --> 01:23:10,251
Aah!

1090
01:23:10,656 --> 01:23:12,009
Aah!

1091
01:23:20,536 --> 01:23:22,447
Aaah!

1092
01:23:39,056 --> 01:23:39,772
Aah!

1093
01:24:31,896 --> 01:24:33,488
Watch your head.

1094
01:24:44,536 --> 01:24:46,527
Oh, thank God.

1095
01:24:47,896 --> 01:24:49,693
I thought...

1096
01:24:51,416 --> 01:24:53,054
Bulletproof vest.

1097
01:24:56,736 --> 01:25:01,093
I just need
a little "R" and "R," huh?

1098
01:25:01,176 --> 01:25:03,371
Surf and sand.

1099
01:25:05,656 --> 01:25:07,886
Just stay still.

1100
01:25:09,496 --> 01:25:11,646
- Just stay still.
- Uh- huh.

1101
01:25:14,136 --> 01:25:15,694
Hey, you, uh...

1102
01:25:17,056 --> 01:25:19,365
You think they're
ever gonna believe us?

1103
01:25:21,176 --> 01:25:23,485
They won't have to.

1104
01:25:23,536 --> 01:25:25,527
We can prove it.

1105
01:25:27,256 --> 01:25:29,372
After Bobby died...

1106
01:25:29,456 --> 01:25:32,175
I changed the clock back
15 minutes.

1107
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:35,769
What are you talking about?

1108
01:25:35,856 --> 01:25:37,847
What did Harris always tell us?

1109
01:25:37,936 --> 01:25:41,372
Know the mind, then anticipate.

1110
01:25:41,456 --> 01:25:45,688
The killer was into deadlines,
precision, timing,

1111
01:25:45,776 --> 01:25:48,574
so I set that clock
15 minutes back.

1112
01:25:48,656 --> 01:25:50,009
The clock?

1113
01:25:50,096 --> 01:25:51,165
Oh, yeah.

1114
01:25:51,256 --> 01:25:54,009
He wanted us to know exactly
when he was going to strike,

1115
01:25:54,096 --> 01:25:55,290
wanted to watch us squirm

1116
01:25:55,376 --> 01:25:58,334
as precious seconds
were ticking away.

1117
01:25:58,416 --> 01:26:00,213
It was all part of his fun.

1118
01:26:01,176 --> 01:26:02,655
His weakness.

1119
01:26:04,016 --> 01:26:06,166
I was betting
he'd change it back.

1120
01:26:06,256 --> 01:26:07,735
I was right.

1121
01:26:08,616 --> 01:26:11,926
But how are you gonna prove it
was Gabe who changed it back?

1122
01:26:13,056 --> 01:26:15,934
Remember the phosphorescent
powder from the jackets?

1123
01:26:16,016 --> 01:26:17,893
That's what I put on the clock.

1124
01:26:25,496 --> 01:26:27,248
It was my turn to set a trap.

1125
01:26:27,336 --> 01:26:29,008
So when he touched it...

1126
01:26:29,096 --> 01:26:32,406
Mm- hmm.
His hands are going to glow.

1127
01:26:32,496 --> 01:26:33,645
Watch.

1128
01:27:04,136 --> 01:27:05,808
This is awkward.

1129
01:27:09,136 --> 01:27:10,854
You know, uh...

1130
01:27:12,656 --> 01:27:16,012
All these things, they worked
pretty good, you know.

1131
01:27:16,096 --> 01:27:18,769
Timers, triggers.

1132
01:27:18,856 --> 01:27:20,494
Remotes.

1133
01:27:22,416 --> 01:27:23,531
But at the end of the day,

1134
01:27:23,616 --> 01:27:27,814
building a better mousetrap
is just pure mechanics.

1135
01:27:27,856 --> 01:27:31,292
It's knowing how to bait
a particular mouse.

1136
01:27:31,376 --> 01:27:33,412
That's the fun part.

1137
01:27:34,776 --> 01:27:36,289
Ah, ah, ah- ah.

1138
01:27:45,856 --> 01:27:47,847
So there I was.

1139
01:27:47,936 --> 01:27:50,928
Sitting next to the bodies
of my parents.

1140
01:27:51,016 --> 01:27:52,085
Just waiting for someone

1141
01:27:52,176 --> 01:27:54,485
to ask me
why I killed them, you know?

1142
01:27:54,576 --> 01:27:56,407
And this detective
comes up to me, right?

1143
01:27:56,496 --> 01:27:58,168
And he says...

1144
01:27:59,576 --> 01:28:01,009
"Want some gum?"

1145
01:28:02,176 --> 01:28:03,370
Gum.

1146
01:28:04,496 --> 01:28:06,088
No one asks.

1147
01:28:06,216 --> 01:28:08,684
It never even occurs to them.

1148
01:28:09,976 --> 01:28:12,206
And like after
every first high...

1149
01:28:12,296 --> 01:28:15,766
it's harder and harder
to get to that place.

1150
01:28:15,856 --> 01:28:19,371
And finally you get so good,
there's no feeling at all.

1151
01:28:19,456 --> 01:28:20,889
It's easy.

1152
01:28:22,256 --> 01:28:24,724
Finding a worthy prey.

1153
01:28:24,816 --> 01:28:27,011
A challenge.

1154
01:28:27,056 --> 01:28:28,569
That's hard.

1155
01:28:29,736 --> 01:28:32,773
You joined the FBI for this?

1156
01:28:32,856 --> 01:28:34,130
Yeah.

1157
01:28:35,376 --> 01:28:37,412
Yeah.

1158
01:28:37,456 --> 01:28:39,970
So while you were studying
tired old hacks

1159
01:28:40,016 --> 01:28:42,689
like Bundy, Gacy, and Dahmer,

1160
01:28:42,736 --> 01:28:44,647
I was studying you.

1161
01:28:44,736 --> 01:28:47,375
Your habits, your hang- ups,
your weaknesses.

1162
01:28:47,456 --> 01:28:50,095
It was so simple
to set you all on edge.

1163
01:28:52,536 --> 01:28:53,571
You know?

1164
01:28:53,656 --> 01:28:55,612
I had to push here...

1165
01:28:55,696 --> 01:28:58,164
pull there...
but once I did...

1166
01:28:58,256 --> 01:29:00,690
Hey, Vince, check out
the other side of town.

1167
01:29:00,776 --> 01:29:03,006
I knew each of you
would play your part.

1168
01:29:05,816 --> 01:29:08,284
The key to effective illusion
is misdirection.

1169
01:29:08,336 --> 01:29:09,689
You know there's a bomb
on the boat.

1170
01:29:09,776 --> 01:29:11,812
You don't run toward it
first in line.

1171
01:29:11,896 --> 01:29:13,170
You know?

1172
01:29:13,256 --> 01:29:14,928
All I needed was opportunity.

1173
01:29:16,216 --> 01:29:18,366
The coffee break gave me
the chance I needed

1174
01:29:18,416 --> 01:29:20,247
to rig a few little surprises.

1175
01:29:22,616 --> 01:29:24,368
The answer was
in front of your eyes.

1176
01:29:24,456 --> 01:29:25,684
You still couldn't see it.

1177
01:29:25,776 --> 01:29:28,290
It was you who said
to turn off the water.

1178
01:29:28,376 --> 01:29:29,491
The rest was easy.

1179
01:29:29,576 --> 01:29:32,613
You're all
so fucking predictable.

1180
01:29:32,656 --> 01:29:34,135
Nicole with her cigarettes.

1181
01:29:34,216 --> 01:29:37,367
Can't she even read
the warning label on the box?

1182
01:29:38,096 --> 01:29:41,645
Vince...
"I'm never without my gun. "

1183
01:29:41,736 --> 01:29:44,967
Bobby the Magnificent
couldn't resist.

1184
01:29:45,016 --> 01:29:48,452
And Harris
just had to stay and watch.

1185
01:29:49,896 --> 01:29:52,364
Party crasher here was more
of a problem than I thought,

1186
01:29:52,456 --> 01:29:55,892
but why am I gonna work
so hard to kill him

1187
01:29:55,976 --> 01:29:57,887
when I knew you'd do it for me?

1188
01:30:00,256 --> 01:30:04,090
You see, the water
ain't your only weakness, Sara.

1189
01:30:08,376 --> 01:30:10,526
Your other weakness...

1190
01:30:10,616 --> 01:30:12,095
is me.

1191
01:30:39,896 --> 01:30:42,251
In truth, I couldn't have
done it without you.

1192
01:30:42,296 --> 01:30:44,207
As a sign of my appreciation,
I'm gonna grant you

1193
01:30:44,296 --> 01:30:45,570
your deepest desire.

1194
01:30:45,656 --> 01:30:50,093
I'm gonna get you closer to your
sister than you ever imagined.

1195
01:30:54,256 --> 01:30:56,929
One Mississippi,
two Mississippi.

1196
01:31:02,696 --> 01:31:05,256
Are we having fun yet?

1197
01:31:08,976 --> 01:31:10,091
Whoa.

1198
01:33:23,416 --> 01:33:24,644
Drop it!

1199
01:33:28,616 --> 01:33:30,925
Go ahead, Sara.
Arrest me.

1200
01:33:32,856 --> 01:33:35,973
We have your blood
under Rafe's fingernails.

1201
01:33:36,016 --> 01:33:39,486
Your fingerprints
on the fire extinguisher.

1202
01:33:39,536 --> 01:33:41,970
And your bullet in my neck.

1203
01:33:43,416 --> 01:33:45,168
That don't look good.

1204
01:33:46,856 --> 01:33:48,608
You're fucked.

1205
01:33:54,096 --> 01:33:56,485
Time's up, asshole.

1206
01:34:20,176 --> 01:34:22,531
Good thing you hit like a girl.

1207
01:34:30,976 --> 01:34:33,536
I guess we found out
his weakness.

1208
01:34:34,616 --> 01:34:36,334
Bullets.

1209
01:35:04,976 --> 01:35:07,092
Do you think they'll let me
make profiler?

1210
01:35:07,176 --> 01:35:10,486
That depends.
One last question.

1211
01:35:11,736 --> 01:35:15,411
When's the situation secure,
Agent?

1212
01:35:16,136 --> 01:35:17,728
On the drive home.

1213
01:35:17,816 --> 01:35:19,090
Yeah.

1214
01:35:20,056 --> 01:35:21,614
On the drive home.

1215
