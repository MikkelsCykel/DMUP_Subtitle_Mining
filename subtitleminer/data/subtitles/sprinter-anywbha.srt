1
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,939
My mother made an amazing amount
of noise when she ate her food.

2
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:50,861
It was as if she was trying to taste
the entire world.

3
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,655
Sometimes I just couldn 't stand her.

4
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:56,783
Sometimes I hated her.

5
00:01:57,326 --> 00:02:00,495
Sometimes I thought
she was ruining my life.

6
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:05,959
What kept me going was knowing
one day I'd leave her.

7
00:02:18,347 --> 00:02:21,266
Come on, baby, surfing safari

8
00:02:21,517 --> 00:02:24,186
I'm gonna take you
Surfing safari

9
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:27,064
I'm gonna take you
Surfing safari

10
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:30,150
I'm gonna take you
Surfing safari

11
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,320
Let's go surfing now
Everybody's learning how

12
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,114
Come on and safari with me

13
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:40,536
-I hate this song.
-I Iove the Beach Boys.

14
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:44,122
-I hate them'
-How can you hate them?

15
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:48,669
-They're happy and sunny.
-You'II Iearn to Iike that.

16
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:51,672
That's what CaIifornia's aII about.

17
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:56,760
Next stop, SaIt Lake City.
SaIt Lake City, Utah.

18
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,763
-The capitaI, right?
-I don't care.

19
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,807
You do. Don't mumbIe.

20
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:05,394
You care. You're very good
at capitaIs.

21
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:09,815
-Idaho? Pooh Bear.
-Stop caIIing me "Pooh Bear. "

22
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:15,195
But you are my IittIe Pooh Bear.
Come on. Come on. Idaho?

23
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:19,032
-Boise. I don't wanna pIay'
-Do a hard one for me.

24
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:21,201
I don't wanna pIay.

25
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:25,622
-Oregon?
-PortIand. Too easy.

26
00:03:25,831 --> 00:03:27,916
-It's SaIem.
-SaIem?

27
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:32,296
I don't wanna do this anymore.
I don't wanna be in Utah.

28
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:38,218
2000 miIes between us and Bay City.
Okay'

29
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:42,806
I miss Bay City.
This is Iike being kidnapped.

30
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:47,102
-I wish I'd been kidnapped at your age.
-So do I.

31
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:06,622
Grandma always said
Mom was a strange child.

32
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:17,341
-She's absoIuteIy moribund'
-Gwenn Purvis has cancer.

33
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:21,094
-That's worse.
-I didn't give it to her.

34
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:25,015
You didn't give it to her.
That's funny.

35
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:30,312
-You're gonna die one day too.
-But not in this town.

36
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,900
My mother never wanted
to stay in Bay City.

37
00:04:35,234 --> 00:04:37,611
I think she married Ted...

38
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:40,447
...because he was so nice and clean.

39
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:44,993
Being an ice-skating instructor
made him seem cleaner.

40
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:50,374
She missed my real father,
who was Egyptian, dark and romantic.

41
00:04:54,253 --> 00:04:58,006
One Christmas Eve,
I heard my parents argue.

42
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:05,931
I knew nothing until he was gone.

43
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:12,604
He left in our brown Valiant.

44
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:17,985
I'm sorry.

45
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:19,820
I'm sorry.

46
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,655
I'm so sorry.

47
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,962
You're awfuIIy quiet.

48
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:42,509
-You said we'd see a reservation.
-When we get to one, we wiII.

49
00:05:42,718 --> 00:05:46,763
Don't mumbIe. How can you be
an actress if you can't speak?

50
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:52,102
I don't want to be an actress.
I bet we won't even stop in Las Vegas.

51
00:05:52,311 --> 00:05:55,480
-That's what's wrong'
-You said you had his number.

52
00:05:55,731 --> 00:05:58,734
I said we'II Iook him up, okay?

53
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:02,321
Your father Ieft in
the middIe of the night.

54
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:07,284
So what? You Ieft my stepdad
in the middIe of the afternoon.

55
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,953
-I miss Ted.
-He's boring.

56
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:13,707
-Why'd you marry him?
-None of your business.

57
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:18,295
-He ran around with other women.
-Not true'

58
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:23,008
You made it up. You wanted him to,
to catch him and get his money.

59
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:27,095
-You IittIe snoop'
-And Ted's not a homosexuaI.

60
00:06:27,346 --> 00:06:29,556
-I never said that.
-You did.

61
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:35,938
I inferred it, but I never said it.
"Light in the Ioafers" isn't the same.

62
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:37,648
AII right, Mother.

63
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:39,608
Ted said he Ioves you.

64
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:43,654
He was worried you saw other peopIe.
You probabIy were.

65
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:45,906
That's it!I've had it with you'

66
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:50,619
You miss Ted so much, go find Ted.
Get out of the car'

67
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:55,833
-You said we'd see buffaIo.
-Tough shit!Get out of the car.

68
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:21,793
Ted wiII teach ice-skating
for the rest of his Iife.

69
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:23,879
Cousin Benny wiII be
a mechanic.

70
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:26,089
LoIy won't Ieave the bank.

71
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:27,925
Your cousin HaI drinks Iiquor.

72
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:31,887
SyIvia and the baby can
bareIy breathe there.

73
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:36,558
I now have a job teaching
in the Los AngeIes schooI system.

74
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:41,355
My M.A. in earIy education was wasted
in that dink junior high.

75
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:44,691
So forget about buffaIo and Indians.

76
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:48,654
You're a beautifuI girI
with great potentiaI.

77
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:52,658
I won't Iet you be nothing
in a nothing town.

78
00:08:52,908 --> 00:08:54,868
You are 1 4 years oId.

79
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:58,288
You've aIways had food
and a pIace to Iive.

80
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:01,959
Stick with me, you aIways wiII.
I'm your mother.

81
00:09:02,251 --> 00:09:06,380
And I know what is best for you,
because that is my job.

82
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:11,969
Your schooI is in BeverIy HiIIs,
the best schooI district in the U.S.

83
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:15,931
You'II be a chiId actor,
whiIe stiII a chiId.

84
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:20,686
You don't have a job
in the L.A. schooI district.

85
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:25,148
I wiII. I have an interview
and a great outfit.

86
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:27,359
-You hungry?
-I don't know.

87
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:30,028
-Excuse me?
-I don't know.

88
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:32,739
Great!So am I.

89
00:09:32,948 --> 00:09:34,491
So. . . .

90
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:40,747
Look at that. Is it the most
beautifuI car you've ever seen?

91
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:45,043
No. I hate that car.
I miss the PIymouth.

92
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:50,799
Baby, nobody misses a PIymouth.

93
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:55,262
-It's your coIor.
-It is, isn't it?

94
00:09:57,097 --> 00:10:00,601
Look at this. It's so beautifuI.

95
00:10:01,727 --> 00:10:04,730
-How's it feeI?
-SubIime'

96
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:08,275
-We can't afford this.
-I have savings.

97
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:11,111
I'II dip into my retirement fund.

98
00:10:11,737 --> 00:10:15,741
This car doesn't beIong in Bay City.
Neither do we.

99
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:23,248
We'II drive to BeverIy HiIIs
in this car.

100
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:12,589
This pIace Iooks expensive.
I'II worry about that.

101
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:17,719
Now we're in BeverIy HiIIs,
maybe we'II caII you "Heather. "

102
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:25,561
-It smeIIs nice. How much is the room?
-It's $1 200.

103
00:11:25,811 --> 00:11:30,607
A night?
I don't know that it's Iarge enough.

104
00:11:30,858 --> 00:11:34,278
-Do you have any viIIas?
-Not right now.

105
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:38,240
Mom, I'm tired.
Where wiII we sIeep tonight?

106
00:11:47,124 --> 00:11:52,171
Sweet Pea, you are just as pretty
as these girIs on TV.

107
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:55,090
I think you're prettier.

108
00:11:58,886 --> 00:12:01,722
Sweetie? Are you aII right?

109
00:12:02,973 --> 00:12:05,893
You've been in there over an hour.

110
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:12,566
Okay, weII, I'm gonna go to sIeep
now. And I think you shouId soon. . .

111
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:18,280
. . .because you need your beauty rest.
Okay? Okay, good night.

112
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:28,415
I miss everyone in Bay City so much.

113
00:12:28,624 --> 00:12:32,377
I don 't know how I'll survive
without Benny.

114
00:12:34,213 --> 00:12:37,799
And my best friend, good little Mary.

115
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:41,887
Serious Mary, Benny and I...

116
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:44,473
... we were inseparable.

117
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:47,809
I made this for you.

118
00:12:48,894 --> 00:12:53,941
It's tin and painted on one side
with goId dust.

119
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:59,738
-It's not reaI goId dust.
-Ann, we're ready to go'

120
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:05,118
Where do you want
the cookies and the sandwiches?

121
00:13:05,327 --> 00:13:07,037
Mom, thanks.

122
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:10,374
You didn't give her aII the cookies?

123
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:12,584
CaII us from the road.

124
00:13:12,835 --> 00:13:17,881
-You'II visit us.
-She doesn't have a pIace to Iive.

125
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:21,635
-Stop worrying about it, Ma.
-Even a job.

126
00:13:21,844 --> 00:13:26,473
-She's got the schooI job.
-She does not, just taIked to someone.

127
00:13:26,682 --> 00:13:28,809
When wiII you have faith in me?

128
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:31,144
When you see things as they are.

129
00:13:31,353 --> 00:13:34,606
-Don't take any wooden nickeIs.
-Right.

130
00:13:34,815 --> 00:13:37,484
Okay, thanks.

131
00:13:39,695 --> 00:13:40,696
Sorry, Ted.

132
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:44,783
I'II write.

133
00:13:47,578 --> 00:13:50,831
Ann! Come on
or I'II Ieave without you'

134
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,541
Benny'

135
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,002
Ben'

136
00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:07,014
You destroyed the photos
of me in my underwear?

137
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:09,808
I did, Mary. I promise.

138
00:14:12,144 --> 00:14:14,813
Let's go! We'II caII from the road.

139
00:14:15,022 --> 00:14:17,941
-I Iove you.
-I Iove you too, Grandma.

140
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:23,906
Ann! Just in case you find
a skating rink out there.

141
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:25,741
Thanks, Ted.

142
00:14:26,283 --> 00:14:30,412
I Iove you. You're the best
stepdad a girI couId have.

143
00:15:02,236 --> 00:15:06,281
Here's a good one:
"PooI, waIk-in cIosets. . .

144
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:09,910
. . .security, vauIted ceiIings. "

145
00:15:10,077 --> 00:15:13,789
-VauIted. I Iove it.
-Excuse me.

146
00:15:13,997 --> 00:15:17,000
I'm sorry. I couIdn't heIp
but overhearing.

147
00:15:17,251 --> 00:15:21,630
I thought I might heIp you.
I'm GaiI Letterfine.

148
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:24,675
-Westside ReaIty.
-Oh.

149
00:15:26,176 --> 00:15:30,222
-What do you want?
-Something in BeverIy HiIIs.

150
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:33,767
-I'm AdeIe August. My daughter, Ann.
-Hi.

151
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:35,519
Hi.

152
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:38,730
She's not awake.
We're from Wisconsin.

153
00:15:38,897 --> 00:15:43,402
-I don't know anyone from Wisconsin--
-I'm awake.

154
00:15:44,695 --> 00:15:49,324
-You Iive in BeverIy HiIIs?
-Santa Monica. FormerIy BeI Air.

155
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:53,620
FormerIy Brentwood.
I've had many formerIies in my Iife.

156
00:15:55,706 --> 00:16:00,669
I'm fine now.
I'm singIe, I'm free and I Iove it.

157
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:04,673
-Most of the time.
-Excuse me.

158
00:16:08,093 --> 00:16:12,222
-She wants to be an actress.
-Don't they aII?

159
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:18,395
Operator.

160
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:23,192
TeII her it's her granddaughter,
and I'II pay her back.

161
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,862
What do we have aIong BeverIy Vista?

162
00:16:27,696 --> 00:16:29,740
BeverIy HiIIs-adjacent.

163
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:35,204
It's not posh, but it's within
the schooI district.

164
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:43,086
What are you doing? You okay?

165
00:16:44,171 --> 00:16:49,009
GaiI found something.
She's raising three teenagers aIone.

166
00:16:49,301 --> 00:16:54,348
Husband ran off with an accountant.
Come with me whiIe I pee.

167
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:59,061
She didn't say so,
but I think she has a gIass eye.

168
00:16:59,311 --> 00:17:02,147
It makes somebody interesting.

169
00:17:02,397 --> 00:17:07,027
You know what I mean?
Interesting in a mysterious way.

170
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:18,539
You want a ride?

171
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:24,628
Ann, there you are.
Your mom wants you.

172
00:17:24,837 --> 00:17:28,757
-I saw her.
-I think we might've found a pIace.

173
00:17:31,176 --> 00:17:36,056
It's hard making changes,
but you have to get used to it.

174
00:17:36,265 --> 00:17:39,768
-Life is fuII of them.
-Where did you go?

175
00:17:39,977 --> 00:17:43,981
I was taIking to you.
I come out and you're gone.

176
00:18:38,452 --> 00:18:40,496
You didn't get the job.

177
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:45,292
It's in the bag, baby.

178
00:18:48,337 --> 00:18:50,297
-Are you serious?
-Yes'

179
00:18:52,007 --> 00:18:54,676
-I hate my hair.
-It's an asset.

180
00:18:54,927 --> 00:18:58,180
-I want to cut it.
-Over my dead body.

181
00:18:58,430 --> 00:18:59,515
Okay.

182
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:02,476
-Okay.
-Let's go.

183
00:19:13,111 --> 00:19:17,407
-They're dressed for the beach.
-The smart girIs are inside.

184
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:21,578
Baby--

185
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:24,498
I hate you.

186
00:19:24,748 --> 00:19:28,001
We'II taIk about that Iater.
Good Iuck'

187
00:19:28,377 --> 00:19:32,840
How about "good Iuck" for me?
How do I Iook?

188
00:19:55,737 --> 00:19:57,447
Just back off'

189
00:20:01,368 --> 00:20:05,289
This is our new speech pathoIogist,
AdeIe August.

190
00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:10,002
-She's from Bay City, Wisconsin.
-America's DairyIand.

191
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:14,214
-Wisconsin. George FrankIin, history.
-History?

192
00:20:16,466 --> 00:20:19,386
-Room 1 2 is to the right?
-I'II show you.

193
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:21,430
Thank you so much.

194
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:29,563
Not exactIy Bay City,
but you get used to it.

195
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:39,573
Did they throw out that furniture?
Is that garbage?

196
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:41,158
UnbeIievabIe.

197
00:20:44,411 --> 00:20:46,622
Don't scratch the car.

198
00:20:46,872 --> 00:20:49,875
On days off, we'd drive to relax.

199
00:20:51,043 --> 00:20:53,337
We drove just anywhere.

200
00:20:54,213 --> 00:20:56,256
She was in awe of the homes...

201
00:20:56,507 --> 00:21:00,802
...and palm trees and movie stars
on public sidewalks.

202
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:04,556
She was in love with Beverly Hills.

203
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:09,269
-I Iike the circuIar driveway.
-I want the corner room.

204
00:21:09,603 --> 00:21:14,733
-I'd cIimb out that window.
-I've got the one overIooking the pooI.

205
00:21:19,738 --> 00:21:20,906
That one's a beauty.

206
00:21:21,532 --> 00:21:23,992
With the cute bIue shutters.

207
00:21:24,243 --> 00:21:26,703
Look at this house'

208
00:21:27,496 --> 00:21:30,666
This is the house I want. BeautifuI.

209
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:33,126
It says, "By appointment onIy. "

210
00:21:33,418 --> 00:21:36,672
-It says, "Do not disturb occupants. "
-It'II be fun.

211
00:21:36,922 --> 00:21:39,383
It's okay. It'II be fun.

212
00:21:39,591 --> 00:21:41,468
PIease think about it.

213
00:21:41,677 --> 00:21:44,680
-You're the reaItor?
-Can I heIp you?

214
00:21:44,888 --> 00:21:47,182
What a-- He gave me a kiss'

215
00:21:47,391 --> 00:21:50,644
-This is CaIIey.
-You must be the owner.

216
00:21:50,894 --> 00:21:55,190
I'm AdeIe August,
and this is my baby, Heather.

217
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,150
Can I heIp you?

218
00:21:57,401 --> 00:22:02,114
We have no appointment but my
husband, a doctor at UCLA--

219
00:22:02,322 --> 00:22:05,242
-That's minutes from here.
-ExactIy.

220
00:22:05,534 --> 00:22:07,911
We drove by and had to stop.

221
00:22:08,162 --> 00:22:10,998
We'd Iove to see the house.

222
00:22:11,248 --> 00:22:13,542
-Do you mind?
-Not at aII.

223
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:17,421
Here's my card,
and a setup on the property.

224
00:22:17,629 --> 00:22:20,007
The house is from the 1 920s.

225
00:22:20,257 --> 00:22:23,010
It has aII its originaI integrity.

226
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:27,806
We aIso have a wood-burning firepIace.
There are seven in the house.

227
00:22:28,056 --> 00:22:30,517
There's so much Iight.

228
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:33,061
It's a very happy house.

229
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:35,147
-Happy, isn't it?
-Happy.

230
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:39,818
Here's a beautifuI, bright bedroom.
There's the pooI.

231
00:22:40,027 --> 00:22:42,654
It's a IoveIy master suite.

232
00:22:42,863 --> 00:22:47,409
No, it's my daughter's bedroom.
She's away at coIIege.

233
00:22:47,659 --> 00:22:50,662
-Where is she?
-Back East. Princeton.

234
00:22:50,871 --> 00:22:53,707
I want to go to coIIege back East.

235
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:58,462
-You must miss her terribIy.
-But we're so proud.

236
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:03,550
Daddy wiII be here next week.
I want him to see this house.

237
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,637
I'II show you the master bedroom.

238
00:23:06,845 --> 00:23:09,681
It's got a great waIk-in cIoset.

239
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:13,227
It aIso has a fantastic
Jacuzzi tub. . . .

240
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:42,130
Hello?
-What's up, pervert?

241
00:23:42,381 --> 00:23:44,591
-Who is this?
-It's Hot Stuff.

242
00:23:45,342 --> 00:23:46,802
Ann.

243
00:23:47,219 --> 00:23:50,389
-Hey, Benny.
-Where are you?

244
00:23:50,597 --> 00:23:54,893
CaIIing from someone's bedroom.
What are you doing?

245
00:23:55,102 --> 00:23:57,145
Hal's taking us to the park.

246
00:23:57,396 --> 00:23:59,523
He got that new truck.

247
00:23:59,773 --> 00:24:02,943
-Why are you whispering?
-How's Grandma?

248
00:24:03,151 --> 00:24:06,655
She's fine. You're in
someone's bedroom?

249
00:24:06,864 --> 00:24:09,158
I'II write. Get my Iast one?

250
00:24:09,408 --> 00:24:12,244
Yeah, I got them all.

251
00:24:12,494 --> 00:24:15,664
I Iiked the one where
she kicked you out of the car.

252
00:24:15,914 --> 00:24:20,460
She's crazy. I think I might
kiII her in her sIeep.

253
00:24:21,712 --> 00:24:24,548
-I have to go.
-Heather Ann. . . .

254
00:24:25,424 --> 00:24:27,134
That was so much fun.

255
00:24:27,342 --> 00:24:30,262
-You said we'd buy it'
-I said we might.

256
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:34,308
And that my father's coming,
he's a doctor?

257
00:24:34,516 --> 00:24:37,769
Why were you in the daughter's room?

258
00:24:37,978 --> 00:24:40,022
CaIIing Benny.

259
00:24:41,356 --> 00:24:42,816
What? Ann'

260
00:24:44,151 --> 00:24:47,070
I had to say your dad's a doctor.

261
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:52,326
She gets money from her husband.
She'd think I couIdn't afford it.

262
00:24:52,534 --> 00:24:57,331
Oh, and Iike you can afford it.
You couIdn't afford the bathroom.

263
00:24:57,539 --> 00:25:00,459
Be optimistic
Don 't you be a grumpy

264
00:25:00,709 --> 00:25:04,755
When the road gets bumpy
Just smile and be happy

265
00:25:08,634 --> 00:25:12,137
-Good morning, AdeIe.
-Morning, George.

266
00:25:12,346 --> 00:25:15,682
-Grand CouIee Dam. Ever been there?
-No.

267
00:25:16,433 --> 00:25:18,143
Hoover Dam?

268
00:25:18,393 --> 00:25:19,853
No.

269
00:25:20,103 --> 00:25:22,940
I'm not reaIIy into dams.

270
00:25:23,607 --> 00:25:27,819
"I'II get a Iawyer and sue
for invasion of privacy.

271
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:31,323
-Stop reading my diary, Mother. "
-CooI.

272
00:25:31,573 --> 00:25:35,077
-Did she say anything?
-Never did it again.

273
00:25:35,285 --> 00:25:40,082
-I wish they'd Ieave me aIone.
-I Iove being aIone.

274
00:25:40,833 --> 00:25:43,585
-Hi.
-Hi, Peter.

275
00:25:44,461 --> 00:25:47,798
-You run good. You got good form.
-Yeah.

276
00:25:49,132 --> 00:25:51,969
Not a cIoud in the sky today.

277
00:25:53,595 --> 00:25:56,598
-You ever read T.S. EIiot?
-What?

278
00:25:56,807 --> 00:25:59,268
Four Quartets. ReaIIy good.

279
00:26:00,435 --> 00:26:02,813
Why do you run with a book?

280
00:26:03,689 --> 00:26:05,732
BaIance, I guess.

281
00:26:09,236 --> 00:26:14,366
Kariba Dam. It impounds
the Zambezi River, forms Kariba Lake.

282
00:26:14,741 --> 00:26:19,872
-It's nice.
-I went to paint it after coIIege.

283
00:26:21,123 --> 00:26:23,792
You painted pictures of dams?

284
00:26:24,001 --> 00:26:27,671
It was my dream:
traveI the worId and paint.

285
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,923
What happened?

286
00:26:30,174 --> 00:26:34,636
I don't know. "One dam thing
Ied to another dam thing. "

287
00:26:39,516 --> 00:26:41,643
I became a history teacher.

288
00:26:41,852 --> 00:26:45,272
But one of these days--
One of these days.

289
00:26:45,522 --> 00:26:48,525
Oh, my God. Get away from my car'

290
00:26:48,734 --> 00:26:50,527
Look what he's doing'

291
00:26:51,069 --> 00:26:52,613
No. Stop it'

292
00:26:52,821 --> 00:26:56,325
Look how deep--
Look what he did to my car'

293
00:26:56,575 --> 00:26:59,119
Mom, it's just a scratch.

294
00:26:59,536 --> 00:27:00,787
Just a scratch?

295
00:27:00,996 --> 00:27:05,626
Do you know how much it costs
to fix "just a scratch"?

296
00:27:05,834 --> 00:27:10,130
I can't work at this schooI.
I can't taIk to you! No sympathy'

297
00:27:12,174 --> 00:27:14,718
The tiIes are aII cracked.

298
00:27:15,135 --> 00:27:16,595
Chipped.

299
00:27:16,803 --> 00:27:20,224
We're sinking.
I have to keep us afIoat.

300
00:27:20,474 --> 00:27:25,103
Every time I think we're starting
to get somewhere. . .

301
00:27:25,354 --> 00:27:27,814
. . .everything faIIs apart.

302
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:33,070
Jesus'
Nothing works in this apartment'

303
00:27:34,196 --> 00:27:36,865
It's just a scratch on the car.

304
00:27:42,454 --> 00:27:44,832
Maybe if you got yourseIf. . .

305
00:27:45,082 --> 00:27:49,127
. . .an after-schooI job
you'd know what I'm taIking about.

306
00:27:49,419 --> 00:27:53,715
You don't know what things cost,
how to manage money--

307
00:27:53,924 --> 00:27:56,218
What is that now?

308
00:27:57,302 --> 00:28:01,849
-You didn't pay the biII, did you?
-I paid it'

309
00:28:05,477 --> 00:28:09,147
Maybe I won't even pay the biII again.
Maybe we'II. . . .

310
00:28:09,606 --> 00:28:11,483
We couId Iive. . .

311
00:28:11,984 --> 00:28:13,443
. . .in the dark. . .

312
00:28:13,694 --> 00:28:18,323
. . .Iike IittIe bears in a cave,
huh, Pooh Bear?

313
00:28:19,825 --> 00:28:21,076
Just. . . .

314
00:28:26,665 --> 00:28:29,209
Okay, Iet's go to Denny's.

315
00:28:32,337 --> 00:28:33,589
Ann?

316
00:28:34,381 --> 00:28:38,385
-Ann, where are you?
-I'm going to bed.

317
00:28:48,187 --> 00:28:50,647
I reaIIy thought I paid it.

318
00:29:02,284 --> 00:29:04,828
I reaIIy think I did pay it.

319
00:29:22,846 --> 00:29:27,893
I Iove you. Say hi to Benny
and UncIe Jimmy and Aunt CaroI.

320
00:29:28,101 --> 00:29:29,811
Lots of kisses. Bye.

321
00:29:30,062 --> 00:29:33,232
Hi, Mom. How are y'aII doing?

322
00:29:33,482 --> 00:29:35,025
What isn't fair?

323
00:29:35,275 --> 00:29:39,321
I put her on because Ann
needs a decent home. . .

324
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:42,866
. . .so we need cash for a down payment.

325
00:29:43,075 --> 00:29:46,328
What I need from you is some heIp.

326
00:29:47,204 --> 00:29:52,167
SeII my Iand, that's how.
It's the Iand that Daddy--

327
00:29:55,546 --> 00:29:56,797
She hung up.

328
00:29:57,589 --> 00:29:59,716
Grandma hung up on you?

329
00:30:04,012 --> 00:30:05,180
Yeah.

330
00:30:15,023 --> 00:30:18,944
-Let's dress up and go out to dinner.
-What?

331
00:30:19,695 --> 00:30:23,699
You Iove that French pIace.
That's what we need.

332
00:30:25,284 --> 00:30:29,246
We need a bed for me,
a desk, sheets, toweIs. . .

333
00:30:29,454 --> 00:30:32,708
-. . .not to eat in a French restaurant.
-Honey.

334
00:30:32,958 --> 00:30:36,628
My daddy used to say:
"When Iife's rough. . .

335
00:30:36,879 --> 00:30:41,425
. . .and you onIy have a dime,
get your shoes shined. "

336
00:30:43,635 --> 00:30:44,970
Get dressed.

337
00:30:50,809 --> 00:30:55,230
They raised their prices.
Why don't the two of us--?

338
00:30:55,439 --> 00:30:59,568
-Want to hear our speciaIs?
-We know what we want.

339
00:30:59,818 --> 00:31:04,364
-I'd Iike to hear the speciaIs.
-We have veaI St. Jacques--

340
00:31:04,573 --> 00:31:09,203
We'II have two smaII saIads
and share the veaI, right?

341
00:31:09,453 --> 00:31:13,749
I'm hungry. Why don't you
have the veaI St. Jacques?

342
00:31:13,999 --> 00:31:19,129
-I'II have the duck a I'orange.
-Any appetizer?

343
00:31:19,379 --> 00:31:23,926
-I'II have the shrimp in garIic sauce.
-And to drink?

344
00:31:24,134 --> 00:31:28,430
-Just water.
-BottIed. A big bottIe, pIease.

345
00:31:29,848 --> 00:31:31,892
Okay. Thank you.

346
00:31:37,105 --> 00:31:40,943
Know what? I'm hungry
and we're not at Denny's.

347
00:31:41,109 --> 00:31:44,488
So, if someone sees me eat
duck a I'orange. . .

348
00:31:44,738 --> 00:31:47,825
. . .who knows what effect
it'II have on my Iife?

349
00:31:49,576 --> 00:31:53,789
Sit up straight. You're sIouching.

350
00:31:56,124 --> 00:32:00,921
I took out a newspaper ad once.
" 15-year-old seeks home.

351
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:06,260
Neat, pretty, good student. "
I got 79 replies.

352
00:32:08,178 --> 00:32:10,472
I never opened them.

353
00:32:10,722 --> 00:32:13,559
I was afraid of the temptation.

354
00:32:19,898 --> 00:32:23,360
-"Passion. "
-Our first Christmas away from home.

355
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:27,406
Do you customize scents?
No? That's a shame.

356
00:32:27,614 --> 00:32:32,161
My mother paid enough of our bills
so we could buy presents.

357
00:32:34,371 --> 00:32:36,582
Lavender. What do you think?

358
00:32:38,542 --> 00:32:40,502
We didn't buy too much.

359
00:32:40,752 --> 00:32:44,590
-I don't know what to get Benny.
-What did you get me?

360
00:32:44,882 --> 00:32:47,009
-Nothing.
-You did.

361
00:32:47,259 --> 00:32:50,929
What did you get me?
No, don't show me.

362
00:32:51,263 --> 00:32:55,142
Ann, hi! Isn't it obscene,
aII this money being spent?

363
00:32:55,392 --> 00:32:58,729
-I'm Janice PerIeman.
-I'm Ann's mother.

364
00:32:58,937 --> 00:33:01,398
-She's my mother.
-Hi.

365
00:33:01,607 --> 00:33:05,277
-You two Iook aIike.
-No, I Iook Iike my dad.

366
00:33:05,527 --> 00:33:08,447
-Just his chin.
-I Iike your chin, I do.

367
00:33:08,697 --> 00:33:11,074
I gotta go. My mother's waiting.

368
00:33:11,325 --> 00:33:14,828
Christmas Day, we're having
a party from 4 to 8.

369
00:33:15,078 --> 00:33:18,624
-WiII you come, both of you?
-Thanks. That's sweet.

370
00:33:18,874 --> 00:33:23,837
ReaIIy? I'II teII you more at schooI.
Everybody's coming. Bye.

371
00:33:26,048 --> 00:33:28,091
Everybody Iikes her.

372
00:33:28,342 --> 00:33:32,012
She's on student counciI.
Her brother edits the paper.

373
00:33:32,179 --> 00:33:35,974
-What does her father do?
-I think he's a doctor.

374
00:33:36,183 --> 00:33:38,185
WeII, it might be fun.

375
00:33:39,102 --> 00:33:42,064
-You wanna go?
-Do you want me to go?

376
00:33:42,356 --> 00:33:47,778
It'II be a chance to show ourseIves
off. The car's Iooking great again.

377
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,863
Great.

378
00:33:52,366 --> 00:33:55,285
Her mom Iooked very eIegant.

379
00:33:57,079 --> 00:33:59,456
You're eIegant, Mom.

380
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:04,086
We both are. We've got taste, huh?

381
00:34:04,336 --> 00:34:09,049
PeopIe see us and say, "That's an
attractive mother and daughter! "

382
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:11,552
Where do they Iive?

383
00:34:12,845 --> 00:34:15,973
-Why are you doing this?
-Which one is it?

384
00:34:16,765 --> 00:34:21,979
-That one. Now Iet's go home.
-Oh, my God'

385
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:27,860
It goes aII the way around the bIock'

386
00:34:29,987 --> 00:34:34,992
We're both going to a party.
Do you wanna taIk to her again?

387
00:34:35,409 --> 00:34:38,245
Just say Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas'

388
00:34:38,495 --> 00:34:41,415
Merry Christmas to everybody.
I Iove you.

389
00:34:41,623 --> 00:34:44,084
Give a big hug to Benny for me.

390
00:34:44,334 --> 00:34:46,545
Okay. I Iove you. Bye.

391
00:34:47,504 --> 00:34:51,592
I'm gonna go get dressed
and try on my new neckIace.

392
00:35:12,529 --> 00:35:16,867
Mom, it's 4:00.
Are you going to get dressed?

393
00:35:17,493 --> 00:35:22,164
It takes you an hour to get ready.
The party wiII be over by then.

394
00:35:23,624 --> 00:35:28,712
-You said you wanted to go.
-I want to get up the pine needIes. . .

395
00:35:29,046 --> 00:35:31,423
. . .and vacuum those cIosets.

396
00:35:31,632 --> 00:35:37,054
Maybe wash the kitchen fIoor, because
I reaIized what wiII make me happy. . .

397
00:35:37,262 --> 00:35:41,308

and see it's spic-and-span.

398
00:35:42,643 --> 00:35:45,479
It's one fun thing
we can do for Christmas.

399
00:35:45,812 --> 00:35:47,689
Then you shouId go.

400
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:53,362
AII your friends wiII be there. And
that boy, Peter, wiII be there, right?

401
00:35:54,238 --> 00:35:57,699
-What are you going to do?
-Don't worry about me.

402
00:35:57,908 --> 00:36:00,494
I've got a miIIion things to do.

403
00:36:00,744 --> 00:36:05,541
I want our first Christmas
in Los AngeIes to be perfect.

404
00:36:11,463 --> 00:36:13,966
Aren't things bad enough here?

405
00:36:16,218 --> 00:36:18,595
Why are you doing this to me?

406
00:36:21,723 --> 00:36:25,936
You're right. I'm sorry.
You want me to drive you there?

407
00:36:26,395 --> 00:36:29,940
-Want me to drive you?
-No, I can waIk.

408
00:36:34,319 --> 00:36:36,989
AII right. WeII, then go.

409
00:36:39,032 --> 00:36:40,659
Go ahead.

410
00:36:42,327 --> 00:36:47,749
Otherwise we'II just hang around here
aII day taIking about our siIIy Iives.

411
00:36:48,333 --> 00:36:53,755
Oh, gosh. I just had
the strongest memory of my father.

412
00:36:54,214 --> 00:36:55,507
I'm going.

413
00:36:55,716 --> 00:37:01,138
I'm sorry you never got to know
your grandfather, or your father.

414
00:37:01,346 --> 00:37:06,143
But I know it means something to you
to find your father, sweetie.

415
00:37:07,186 --> 00:37:09,479
I promise, we wiII.

416
00:37:09,771 --> 00:37:12,149
-I'm going.
-Okay.

417
00:37:12,441 --> 00:37:16,612
Maybe we can taIk about your father
when you come back.

418
00:37:18,113 --> 00:37:21,575
I'II be here. I'm not
going anywhere. I'II wait.

419
00:38:38,402 --> 00:38:40,279
I'm sorry.

420
00:38:40,571 --> 00:38:43,115

. . .but I couIdn't.

422
00:38:56,461 --> 00:38:59,214
You know what we need?

423
00:38:59,464 --> 00:39:01,592
Some sugar in our bIood.

424
00:39:02,467 --> 00:39:04,803
You wanna get some ice cream?

425
00:39:05,721 --> 00:39:09,766
-I don't want ice cream.
-Sure you do.

426
00:39:10,434 --> 00:39:12,895
Is that what I want, Mom?

427
00:39:14,188 --> 00:39:16,023
It wouId cheer us up.

428
00:39:17,065 --> 00:39:19,651
Okay, Mother, Iet's get our sugar.

429
00:39:21,361 --> 00:39:26,074
-And they've got a new fIavor.

430
00:39:27,201 --> 00:39:28,994

431
00:39:31,246 --> 00:39:34,500
-Just one IittIe--
-No. We're cIosed earIy today.

432
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:36,543
It's Christmas.

433
00:39:36,793 --> 00:39:38,587
Christmas'

434
00:39:39,713 --> 00:39:43,133
Merry Christmas, officer.
You're not working today?

435
00:39:43,383 --> 00:39:47,513
You see that red curb?
See that "No Stopping" sign?

436
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:52,100
Oh, my God'
I'm so sorry. I had no idea.

437
00:39:52,351 --> 00:39:55,062
She needed an ice cream.

438
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:58,440
-Don't bIame it on me.
-I'm expIaining to him--

439
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:01,610
-I hate it when you do this to me.
-Do what?

440
00:40:01,819 --> 00:40:05,656
-It's our Christmas tradition.
-I didn't want ice cream.

441
00:40:05,906 --> 00:40:07,699
-Ann?
-She'II be back.

442
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:11,787
-Excuse me, she won't be back.
-You stay by the car.

443
00:40:11,995 --> 00:40:14,832
-Lady, wait by the car'
-AII right'

444
00:40:15,082 --> 00:40:18,252
Ann, come here.
Ann! Wait.

445
00:40:18,502 --> 00:40:22,965
I toId her not to park there.
I didn't even want any ice cream.

446
00:40:23,215 --> 00:40:26,552
-She's trying to beat a ticket.
-She has Iots.

447
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,930
-Now, now'
-Don't taIk to me Iike a IittIe girI.

448
00:40:32,474 --> 00:40:36,937
You don't even understand.

449
00:40:37,646 --> 00:40:40,107
I'm sure you wiII. But not today.

450
00:40:40,524 --> 00:40:45,320
-Why not today?
-You shouId Ieave when you're caIm.

451
00:40:45,904 --> 00:40:47,614
When you're rationaI.

452
00:40:49,366 --> 00:40:53,745
You Ieave her when you're ready
not to come back. Understand?

453
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:58,250
You from Wisconsin?

454
00:40:58,458 --> 00:41:00,335
How do you know?

455
00:41:00,919 --> 00:41:04,590
-Your pIates. You Iiving here now?
-Yes.

456
00:41:04,798 --> 00:41:06,508
-Hi, Ann.
-Hey.

457
00:41:06,758 --> 00:41:10,012
-I want you to register that car.
-Yes, sir.

458
00:41:10,262 --> 00:41:12,389
-Get a CaIifornia Iicense.
-Yes.

459
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:15,184
-And pay attention to posted signs.
-Yes, sir.

460
00:41:16,351 --> 00:41:19,938
When I roII by again,
I don't want to see your car.

461
00:41:20,397 --> 00:41:23,108
-Yes, sir.
-Good.

462
00:41:25,819 --> 00:41:27,863
Merry Christmas, Ann.

463
00:41:33,076 --> 00:41:34,953
Let's move that vehicIe.

464
00:41:35,537 --> 00:41:37,831
Did he just wink at you?

465
00:41:38,123 --> 00:41:43,504
That's an unusuaI Iaw enforcement
officer. What did he say to you?

466
00:41:43,712 --> 00:41:48,425
He said never to do that to me again,
or you'II be taken to prison.

467
00:41:48,675 --> 00:41:53,305
You'II never see me again, and
you'II have to eat ice cream aIone.

468
00:41:54,348 --> 00:41:58,393
-He didn't say the ice cream business.
-Yes, he did.

469
00:41:58,644 --> 00:42:03,524
-He wants to adopt me, I'm pretty.
-Not funny. Don't do this again.

470
00:42:03,774 --> 00:42:05,484
-Don't you do it.
-No, you.

471
00:42:05,692 --> 00:42:07,486
No, it's you.

472
00:42:07,694 --> 00:42:11,281
I was just trying to get out
of a parking ticket.

473
00:42:11,532 --> 00:42:13,742
-You didn't get one.
-Thanks, Ann.

474
00:42:14,034 --> 00:42:18,330
Your fiancé wiII be back here
to see if we moved the car.

475
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:21,416
I will always love that policeman.

476
00:42:21,625 --> 00:42:24,169
He told me what I needed to know.

477
00:42:24,545 --> 00:42:29,508
I'll always carry a soft spot
for the Los Angeles Police Department.

478
00:42:31,677 --> 00:42:34,137
I wish he had adopted me.

479
00:42:37,724 --> 00:42:42,354
Grandma told me that my father
got remarried and lived in Reno.

480
00:42:43,647 --> 00:42:47,067
How many Hisham Badirs
could there be in Reno?

481
00:42:50,612 --> 00:42:56,034
Hi. Do you have a number
for a Mr. Hisham Badir, pIease?

482
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:58,537
B-A-D-I-R.

483
00:42:59,705 --> 00:43:03,292
Residence. H-I-S-H-A-M.

484
00:43:15,512 --> 00:43:17,556
Okay, thank you.

485
00:43:17,973 --> 00:43:19,433
Bye.

486
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:32,029
When I was young, my mother hummed
one of my father's tunes...

487
00:43:32,237 --> 00:43:34,448
...before we went to sleep.

488
00:43:35,157 --> 00:43:37,784
He wrote my mother love songs.

489
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:45,459
Sometimes I would imagine
my father coming to rescue me.

490
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,215
Hi, Ann.

491
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:53,383
HeIIo, Peter.

492
00:43:54,009 --> 00:43:57,429
You got that isosceIes
triangIe thing straight?

493
00:43:59,014 --> 00:44:00,974
That baffIes me.

494
00:44:03,936 --> 00:44:06,480
I got a new trumpet.
You wanna see it?

495
00:44:07,523 --> 00:44:10,692
-I'm working, Peter.
-Sorry.

496
00:44:14,363 --> 00:44:18,033
-Your mom's reaIIy pretty.
-I'II teII her.

497
00:44:20,327 --> 00:44:22,538
What's your dad do?

498
00:44:23,664 --> 00:44:25,874
He's a songwriter.

499
00:44:26,416 --> 00:44:29,503
I wrote some songs.
You wanna hear one?

500
00:44:30,379 --> 00:44:32,422
Not now, Peter.

501
00:44:32,923 --> 00:44:35,467
You wanna feeI my puIse?

502
00:44:36,176 --> 00:44:38,554
It's beating reaIIy fast.

503
00:44:43,976 --> 00:44:46,103
Ba-boom, ba-boom, ba-boom.

504
00:44:49,064 --> 00:44:50,607
ReaIIy fast.

505
00:44:55,112 --> 00:44:57,489
I've toId you,
the tiIes are chipped.

506
00:44:57,698 --> 00:45:00,868
No water pressure.
Cabinet's handIes are broken.

507
00:45:01,118 --> 00:45:03,871
You don't have a Iife.
Can't you fix--?

508
00:45:04,121 --> 00:45:07,624
I am taIking to you. Hey'

509
00:45:07,875 --> 00:45:09,418
Mom, your pants'

510
00:45:09,668 --> 00:45:12,129
I can't taIk to you Iike this.

511
00:45:12,379 --> 00:45:14,840
Listen, I am teIIing you that--

512
00:45:15,048 --> 00:45:18,719
Not onIy is the tiIe chipped,
the carpets are fiIthy'

513
00:45:18,969 --> 00:45:21,096
I've got a fungus on my foot.

514
00:45:21,346 --> 00:45:25,017
Who Iived here, a hockey team?
I can't Iive Iike this'

515
00:45:25,267 --> 00:45:30,480
But you can Iive in an empty pIace
for six months with just a mattress?'

516
00:45:32,274 --> 00:45:33,734
Damn it'

517
00:45:42,242 --> 00:45:44,286
Turn it down'

518
00:45:44,536 --> 00:45:49,166
I hate this pIace'
I hate my job! I hate my foot'

519
00:46:02,554 --> 00:46:05,557
You're not having sex
with anyone, are you?

520
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:08,727
What?

521
00:46:08,936 --> 00:46:12,689
-You know.
-No, I don't know.

522
00:46:19,530 --> 00:46:22,783
-We have to move.
-We can't. We have a Iease.

523
00:46:22,991 --> 00:46:26,078
What do you mean, am I having sex?

524
00:46:37,881 --> 00:46:39,925
We moved anyway.

525
00:46:42,177 --> 00:46:45,681
Over the next year, we moved a lot.

526
00:46:45,889 --> 00:46:47,683
We got used to it.

527
00:46:47,891 --> 00:46:50,435
Oh, honey, Iet me heIp you.

528
00:46:50,727 --> 00:46:53,897
-It's apartment number eight?
-Yeah, eight.

529
00:46:54,148 --> 00:46:57,985
This one had furniture,
thanks to Miss Letterfine.

530
00:46:59,444 --> 00:47:02,156
Gail and Mom
have become good friends.

531
00:47:05,492 --> 00:47:07,035
It's so coIorfuI.

532
00:47:07,286 --> 00:47:09,913
My mom dragged me to an audition.

533
00:47:10,539 --> 00:47:14,751
She wouldn 't give up her fantasy
of me becoming an actress.

534
00:47:17,379 --> 00:47:18,380
Ann?

535
00:47:19,047 --> 00:47:22,134
We did our work and kept healthy.

536
00:47:22,384 --> 00:47:26,138
--and exhale from your navel
to your backbone.

537
00:47:26,388 --> 00:47:30,225
We went to the beach
and felt sorry for people back home.

538
00:47:30,475 --> 00:47:33,020
-Where are you going?
-Over there.

539
00:47:33,228 --> 00:47:36,648
-There's no one there.
-I need peace and quiet.

540
00:47:36,857 --> 00:47:40,694
-You wanna be near that beach cIub.
-Yes, pIease.

541
00:47:47,451 --> 00:47:49,495
Here's a good spot.

542
00:47:54,708 --> 00:47:59,087
-You've a cute body. Show it off more.
-Show off your body.

543
00:47:59,338 --> 00:48:02,674
-I pIan to. Where are you going?
-Japan.

544
00:48:02,925 --> 00:48:04,384
Heads up'

545
00:48:04,593 --> 00:48:05,969
Sorry about that.

546
00:48:07,429 --> 00:48:09,389
That's okay.

547
00:48:17,314 --> 00:48:18,857
Ooh.

548
00:48:19,066 --> 00:48:20,776
You're strong.

549
00:48:23,445 --> 00:48:25,239
WiId thing.

550
00:49:16,915 --> 00:49:19,459
Ann. Come here, sweetie.

551
00:49:19,710 --> 00:49:23,046
This is Dr. Spritzer.
This is my daughter, Ann.

552
00:49:23,297 --> 00:49:27,843
-Ah, a big girI.
-Oh, yes, we're more Iike sisters.

553
00:49:28,051 --> 00:49:31,138
-So you're the actress.
-Not me. My mom is.

554
00:49:31,346 --> 00:49:34,683
SiIIy, don't be shy.
He's an orthodontist.

555
00:49:34,933 --> 00:49:39,646
He works with actresses.
He did Heather LockIear, her teeth.

556
00:49:39,897 --> 00:49:43,734
I was teIIing him that
we were discussing your overbite.

557
00:49:43,984 --> 00:49:46,987
She has a nice smiIe.
The bottom is strange.

558
00:49:47,237 --> 00:49:49,364
They don't Iook so strange.

559
00:49:49,573 --> 00:49:52,034
Josh! Come on'

560
00:49:52,242 --> 00:49:53,619
Be right there.

561
00:49:53,869 --> 00:49:59,082
-AdeIe, you pIay good baII.
-You too.

562
00:49:59,333 --> 00:50:02,836
Take care of those teeth.
An actress has to smiIe.

563
00:50:03,045 --> 00:50:05,088
-See you.
-See you.

564
00:50:08,133 --> 00:50:10,260
That's probabIy his wife.

565
00:50:10,511 --> 00:50:14,014
-Why did you taIk about my teeth?
-It won't Iast.

566
00:50:15,098 --> 00:50:18,018
-Mom? Mom'
-Here I am.

567
00:50:18,227 --> 00:50:20,896
Guess what? Benny's coming.

568
00:50:23,023 --> 00:50:26,527
-I missed you.
-Hey, come on.

569
00:50:26,819 --> 00:50:28,695
Hi.

570
00:50:31,865 --> 00:50:33,909
What do you think, Benny?

571
00:50:34,117 --> 00:50:37,955
You got more Mercedes on one street
than aII Wisconsin.

572
00:50:38,205 --> 00:50:40,958
-Benny wants to see a movie star.
-Who?
