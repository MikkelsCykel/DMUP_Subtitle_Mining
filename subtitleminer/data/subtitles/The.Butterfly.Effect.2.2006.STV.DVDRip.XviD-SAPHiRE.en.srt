00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:50,874
This spot is beautiful.

2
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:53,145
Yeah, it really is.

3
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:56,052
You guys are lucky. I didn't have
a place like this where I grew up.

4
00:00:56,122 --> 00:00:58,556
What are you talking about?
You grew up like half an hourfrom here.

5
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:01,253
Whatever. My parents
didn't let me out much.

6
00:01:01,327 --> 00:01:03,921
Yeah, well, it was
really amazing for us.

7
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:06,864
In high school we used to sneak out
and come here all the time.

8
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:08,924
That's right.
Late-night rendezvous. In fact,

9
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:13,063
we shared ourfirst bottle
of tequila right here at this very spot.

10
00:01:13,139 --> 00:01:16,472
Wow. I am impressed
that you even rememberthat.

11
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:18,977
"I am impressed that
you even rememberthat."

12
00:01:19,045 --> 00:01:21,570
So do you guys feel like
you were the same as you were back then?

13
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:23,639
Well, I know I'm
exactly the same.

14
00:01:23,716 --> 00:01:26,583
I still have absolutely no idea what
I want to do when I grow up.

15
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:29,417
Well, hey, you used to
work at Foot Locker, and I'm sure

16
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:31,514
if you went back and asked,
they'd give you the job.

17
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:33,752
- Very funny.
- What about you, Nick?

18
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:36,125
- Have you changed much?
- Mmm-mm.

19
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:40,824
Although I must say,
Trevor has gotten way hotter.

20
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,733
You know that that is a fact,
my friend, okay?

21
00:01:43,803 --> 00:01:46,271
My jaw is way wider now.
It's striking.

22
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:49,135
All right, loverboy.
How about you and me

23
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:51,370
go get some wood
forthis fire, huh?

24
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:55,411
All right,
take care.

25
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,644
I got a really good feeling about
the next couple of months.

26
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:00,879
Yeah? Why is that?

27
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:03,548
If we just close a couple
of our own accounts,

28
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,784
you know how huge
that could be for us?

29
00:02:07,393 --> 00:02:11,329
Yeah, I mean, retiring early
would be very nice.

30
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:13,331
By 30?

31
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:15,959
Oh, shit.
Look, look.

32
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:17,161
Gross, dude.

33
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:19,228
Come here. What, you
afraid of a little crab?

34
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:20,829
Gross, dude!
Those things are just sick! Don't!

35
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:23,398
- Come on. Come on.
- No, don't! Dude, don't! Don't!

36
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:25,000
Fucking pussy.

37
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:28,844
This is so exciting!

38
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:31,383
Yeah. Maybe I should
wait till tomorrow.

39
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:34,352
No, you have to
tell him tonight.

40
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,354
Hey. Took you guys
long enough.

41
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:38,481
What are you
talking about?

42
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:42,185
There it goes.
There it goes. Okay, ready?

43
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:44,822
Nice. Yeah, I'm ready.

44
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:47,423
- Happy birthday!
- Oh!

45
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,991
- Oh, they went out. Relight.
- Wait wait.

46
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:52,902
- All right.
- Okay, now make a wish.

47
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:55,202
I can't.
Everything's perfect.

48
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:56,674
- That's lame.
- Oh. Oh, sweetie.

49
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:57,835
Whatever, dude.

50
00:02:57,911 --> 00:02:59,606
If you need something,
I've got a whole list of things.

51
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,738
- How about a million dollars?
- Blow 'em out, already.

52
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:03,975
- Let's do this.
- All right, all right!

53
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,881
- Yay!
- No!

54
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:08,682
- Come on. No. I bought 'em.
- It's my birthday cake.

55
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:11,053
- I want it in the shot.
- In what shot?

56
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:13,991
- Good idea, okay.
- Behave.

57
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,118
- Okay, everybody.
- Come on, hurry up, I want a cupcake.

58
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,060
I know, just hold your horses
for a minute, all right?

59
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:20,065
- Art. It's perfection.
- It's kinda ghetto frosting.

60
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:21,794
- That's good though.
- That's my favorite.

61
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,199
Yup. Are you ready?

62
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:25,328
Yes.

63
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:28,397
- Everybody say "chingas."
- Chingas.

64
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:33,477
- Good, guys.
- Chingas.

65
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,844
Check it out,
ladies and gentlemen.

66
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:37,746
I brought my own
special kind of birthday candle.

67
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:39,910
- All right.
- Drugs!

68
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:41,578
- You kids have fun.
- That is awesome.

69
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:44,555
- Light it up.
- Come here.

70
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,760
- Hey, where are you going?
- Somewhere.

71
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:49,954
- Really?
- With you.

72
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:52,327
- Okay.
- Camera, please.

73
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:54,662
- Yes, sir.
- Put this on.

74
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:59,328
- All right.
- This is kind of exciting.

75
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:03,501
- Oh, I will now be blindfolding you.
- Really?

76
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:07,444
- Are you going to take advantage of me?
- Mm, I might.

77
00:04:07,513 --> 00:04:10,812
- All right, hold this.
- Okay.

78
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:13,545
- And...
- Oh!

79
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,986
- We shall return.
- See you later.

80
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:18,285
Don't worry
about me.

81
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:24,595
- Open.
- Oh.

82
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:28,762
Rememberthe first time
we came here?

83
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:31,395
Yeah. What was that,
like three years ago?

84
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:32,631
Yeah.

85
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:38,143
Nick, um,
there's something

86
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:40,236
that I want to
tell you.

87
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:42,281
Me first.

88
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,417
Happy birthday.

89
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:48,147
Nick! Oh!

90
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:53,819
- It's beautiful.
- Wish it was a diamond, but...

91
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:56,760
Well, I love it.
I love you.

92
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:02,862
Here, put it on.

93
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:09,238
So, tell me again I'm not crazy and I
shouldn't go get my master's.

94
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,709
Oh, no, you should.
You should go pay some

95
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:14,269
art-school lifer
to grade your pictures.

96
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:17,282
I don't have to pay them.
I can use my grant money.

97
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,648
You get the point.

98
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:23,951
And more importantly, it's in New York,
which is 3,000 miles away from me.

99
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:25,251
I know.

100
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,885
My job is about to blow up.
I promise you.

101
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,326
I'm gonna have the money so we can
open your own gallery.

102
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:33,126
You can shoot
your own pictures,

103
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,032
just like we
talked about.

104
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:39,265
- Isn't that what you want?
- Of course.

105
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:47,545
This is perfect.

106
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:49,478
- Hey, don't get that, okay?
- Hey. Oh, where is it?

107
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:50,948
Remember, I wanted to
tell you something.

108
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,577
I know.
Just give me one second.

109
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:59,224
It's work.
Hold on.

110
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:01,658
Hello?

111
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:04,196
Yeah.

112
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:06,231
Oh, okay.

113
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:11,327
Right. No no no, it's not...
it's not a problem.

114
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:14,765
All right.
Bye-bye.

115
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:19,804
It was Bristol.
I have to go to work.

116
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:22,780
Yeah, and it's my birthday,
so call him back,

117
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:24,510
tell him you're sick.
You just can't go.

118
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:28,179
Listen.
If you do this for me,

119
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:30,313
we will come back
here next year,

120
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,381
and we will stay
the whole weekend,

121
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,790
and we'll get
a hotel room, and...

122
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:38,597
Baby?

123
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:43,294
Help me out here. I really need to go
to this meeting.

124
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:47,406
No, forget it.

125
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:52,711
I want a week.

126
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:57,213
- Aweek?
- That's right.

127
00:06:57,283 --> 00:07:00,684
You and me
and no cell phones.

128
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,818
You can personally

129
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:07,485
smash this thing
before we leave.

130
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,619
How's that?

131
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:13,265
Okay.

132
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:16,831
Actually, you know what?
Why wait? I say...

133
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:18,871
we just drown this thing now
to make sure.

134
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:21,600
Oh! Oh! Oh, that's...
I don't think so.

135
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:27,577
Give us something
to talk about

136
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:31,083
Take yourtime...

137
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:40,455
Aw, shit. Baby, did you remember
my sunglasses?

138
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:42,517
Mm? What would you
do without me?

139
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:48,523
Yo, this is stupid!
Bristol's a dick.

140
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:50,967
Yeah, a dick who's gonna
get promoted instead of me

141
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:52,061
if I flake on this meeting.

142
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:55,665
- So he gets to ruin our Sundays then?
- And Julie's birthday.

143
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:58,710
If I want to beat 'em,
I have to join 'em.

144
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:01,008
- Right now!
- Don't.

145
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,538
Whatever, man. I'm telling you you
just should blow the whole thing off.

146
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:07,609
Yeah, you know, you're right.
I don't need this job anyway.

147
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:10,485
Great idea. And when you get fired
I'm sure Trevor will last

148
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:13,024
about two weeks
at work without you.

149
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:15,083
Why do you
have to say that?

150
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,959
Wait, guys.
Hold up, hold up.

151
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:23,602
Okay.
Nice.

152
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:27,362
You know what, baby?
You can move to New York with me,

153
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,203
and we could be
starving artists together.

154
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:30,708
Wouldn't that be perfect, hon?

155
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:32,505
Sounds like you
have it all worked out.

156
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,874
Shit!
Hold on!

157
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:40,177
Oh God!

158
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:45,753
- Is everyone all right?
- You okay? You okay?

159
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:47,759
- I think so.
- Are you sure?

160
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:50,318
- Oh! Oh God!
- Oh, shit!

161
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:54,495
Nick, move! Ah!

162
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:08,806
Nick.

163
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:11,138
Oh, Nick.

164
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,144
Shh.

165
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,744
Shh. Shh.

166
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:18,909
Nick, it's okay.

167
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:26,983
Room 9, we've got a code blue.
He's gone into attack.

168
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:31,189
190 and rising.

169
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:37,700
Shh, Nick.
Shh.

170
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,761
Nick...

171
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:45,603
It's okay.

172
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,979
He gets nightmares
sometimes.

173
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:57,385
He always has.

174
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,585
Nick.

175
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:33,625
Oh, Nick!

176
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:50,298
Where's Julie?

177
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:53,140
Honey, she's...

178
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:57,979
- Where are they?
- They didn't...

179
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,280
- No. No.
- Nick...

180
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:17,800
Okay, everybody.

181
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,804
- Just hold your horses for a minute.
- Hurry up, hurry up.

182
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,680
- Yay! Come on!
- No!

183
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:44,462
You know what? I cannot imagine
my life without you now.

184
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,346
You know, I was thinking...
if you, um...

185
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:06,578
if you really need a change
of scenery or whatever,

186
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:09,519
I've got some extra
room at my place.

187
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:11,988
For what?

188
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:14,548
You.

189
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:17,653
I want you
to live with me.

190
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,575
Nick, it's Mom.

191
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:13,447
How you feeling?
I spoke to the doctor.

192
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,317
He said you canceled
your appointment again.

193
00:14:16,388 --> 00:14:18,982
Nick, you've got to
take care of yourself.

194
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:22,084
You don't want the headaches
to get any worse.

195
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:25,096
Please, call me.

196
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,683
- Hey, man.
- What's up?

197
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:21,379
- Thought you were out sick.
- No.

198
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:25,184
Bristol's looking foryou.
Just a heads up.

199
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:27,225
Thanks, man.

200
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:31,762
- You don't pick up your phone?
- Oh, I was in the copy room.

201
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:32,990
I need those spreadsheets.

202
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:35,226
Yeah, I put 'em on your desk
last night.

203
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:37,769
I was here until 7:00.

204
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:40,100
Afterthat.
Did you check your inbox?

205
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:42,868
Look, I'm telling you
I can't find 'em, so just...

206
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,467
print me up a new report,
spare me the boring fairy tale.

207
00:15:45,544 --> 00:15:47,512
We've got the Rosemont
Equities meeting, one hour.

208
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:49,740
Wait. What are you
talking about?

209
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:52,850
11:00,
sales presentation...

210
00:15:52,918 --> 00:15:55,443
- I thought that was at 4:00.
- I had to move it, okay?

211
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:57,648
And you're just
telling me this now?

212
00:15:57,723 --> 00:15:59,987
Look, Nick,

213
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:03,654
80% of all start-ups fail in the first
two years. It is an uphill battle.

214
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:07,130
Everyone's got to pull
their own weight. No exceptions.

215
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:11,135
Okay. No problem.
I'll have the spreadsheets.

216
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:13,831
I can give the pitch myself if you think
you can't handle it.

217
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:15,601
I said no problem.

218
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:19,105
Okay.

219
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:21,146
You keep
your shit together.

220
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:23,681
Okay? I can't have you pop another
brain fart and fuck this thing up.

221
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:27,585
Clean up your desk.
It's a mess.

222
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:32,152
What we're talking about is software
that will enable your handheld

223
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:35,352
to communicate with
any wireless technology.

224
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:39,864
Imagine being able to access
all of yourtechnology from here.

225
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:42,799
Picture it. Say you're in a cab
on your way to a meeting.

226
00:16:42,868 --> 00:16:46,395
You're checking your e-mails,
you're surfing the web, a call comes in.

227
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:50,033
Well, your new client decides
that they need additional product images

228
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:53,476
to be included in the presentation
that you're giving in an hour.

229
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:55,945
You rush over
to the job site

230
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:59,542
snap a couple of jpegs,
get to your meeting.

231
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:03,280
And gentlemen,
what you've got

232
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:07,416
is a slideshow
in your pocket.

233
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,133
Okay, so...

234
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:21,138
everyone's developing
next-gen software for handhelds,

235
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:24,141
including the big guys.

236
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:26,700
Why put money into yours?

237
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:28,713
Because ours
is ready now.

238
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:30,840
We, with our partners
at Strike Line, believe

239
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:33,441
we can have this on the market
within the quarter.

240
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:53,133
- Nick.
- Is he having a seizure or what?

241
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:57,642
No, he gets headaches.
Nick! Nick!

242
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,613
I'm so sorry.

243
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,519
I swear, if I get
one more S.E.C. Notice,

244
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:19,996
I'm gonna burn the whole stack and move
this thing to the Caymans.

245
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:23,091
Yeah, the weather's
nice there.

246
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:25,659
I'm... sorry about
the meeting, sir.

247
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:28,968
Nick, I shouldn't
have to tell you...

248
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:32,067
80% of all start-ups fail
within the first two years.

249
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:34,271
We make one mistake,
it affects everything.

250
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:36,007
We can't go back
and do this over again.

251
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:38,777
You're absolutely
right.

252
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:42,116
I assure you this will
not happen again.

253
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:45,315
Dave tells me you've been
having some problems lately

254
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:47,324
with concentrating
and remembering stuff.

255
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:49,917
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

256
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:52,122
Really, it's...
it's not a big deal.

257
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:53,721
I want you to just go home,

258
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,324
take the rest of the week off
and recharge the batteries.

259
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:59,199
- Mr. Callahan, really, I can work.
- Nick...

260
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:01,398
I need to work.

261
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:04,909
It's done.
Just go home.

262
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:09,043
We'll see you in a week.

263
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:24,860
Always searching

264
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:29,594
Looking forthe one
to wrap your soul

265
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,693
Around

266
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:38,509
Sing the one name
as you let go

267
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:41,205
The fear of flying

268
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,215
You're on your way

269
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:47,912
Endless love

270
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:00,155
And you say

271
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:08,437
You're gonna turn
time around...

272
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:18,509
Oh, man.

273
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:50,877
Oh, shit. Baby, did you
grab my sunglasses?

274
00:20:50,949 --> 00:20:54,009
Mm? What would you
do without me?

275
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:00,925
Hmm?

276
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:09,194
Yo, this is stupid!
Bristol's a dick.

277
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,202
Yeah, a dick
who'll get promoted

278
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:14,034
instead of me if I flake
on this meeting.

279
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:17,598
- So he gets to ruin our Sundays?
- And Julie's birthday.

280
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:22,211
Whatever, man. I'm telling you you
should just blow the whole thing off.

281
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:26,217
You're right.
I don't really need this job anyway.

282
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:29,353
Yeah.
Great idea.

283
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:31,321
I'm sure when you get fired,
Trevor will last

284
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,483
- two weeks at work without you, maybe.
- "Two weeks at work without you."

285
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:36,857
- Why you got to say that?
- What?

286
00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:39,488
Ooh, guys, wait.
I want to get a picture of this.

287
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,564
Nice. And you
know what, honey?

288
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,575
You can move to New York with me
and we can be starving artists together.

289
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:54,077
- Isn't that a perfect idea?
- Put your seat belt on.

290
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:56,580
- What?
- Put it on!

291
00:21:58,283 --> 00:22:00,513
Okay. Shit.

292
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:21,705
I think so.

293
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:56,091
Hey, pumpkin. Hey, do you know
what you're gonna wear?

294
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:08,673
What's happening?

295
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:10,715
Are you okay?

296
00:24:16,354 --> 00:24:18,322
Nick?

297
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:39,009
Oh, Nick,
are you okay?

298
00:24:39,077 --> 00:24:41,978
What's wrong, huh?
Huh?

299
00:24:45,016 --> 00:24:47,814
What's the matter?

300
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:49,877
I think I was
having a nightmare.

301
00:24:49,955 --> 00:24:51,946
Oh, baby!
It's okay.

302
00:24:52,023 --> 00:24:54,514
All right?
It's all over now. It's all over.

303
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:58,659
Oh, shh.

304
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:07,327
Oh, God!

305
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:11,106
Okay?
Now let's get going.

306
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,337
We'll celebrate my birthday.
It'll be fun.

307
00:25:13,411 --> 00:25:17,313
- Okay.
- I'm gonna go get ready. All right.

308
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,910
Okay.

309
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:32,493
I know how weird it sounds.
It's just...

310
00:25:32,564 --> 00:25:34,896
I can't explain it.
I...

311
00:25:34,966 --> 00:25:38,026
there's this entire
other version

312
00:25:38,103 --> 00:25:40,094
of my life
without you.

313
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:43,766
I went through
a whole year

314
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:46,572
believing you were dead.

315
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:50,604
And then ljust...
ljust wake up, and there you are.

316
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:54,140
Okay, it was just
a bad dream, all right?

317
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:55,948
It wasn't real.

318
00:25:56,021 --> 00:25:58,990
I'm here.
Come on.

319
00:26:01,693 --> 00:26:03,888
I hearyou, I do,

320
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:07,625
but it's just I'm having
a really difficult time believing it.

321
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:10,133
It's been
a traumatic year

322
00:26:10,201 --> 00:26:12,499
for both of us, okay?

323
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:16,200
- But we made it.
- It's not that.

324
00:26:16,274 --> 00:26:18,105
Hey.

325
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:22,440
I am here.

326
00:26:24,816 --> 00:26:27,182
And that's all
that matters.

327
00:26:31,022 --> 00:26:33,889
All right.

328
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:36,689
- You're right.
- I know.

329
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:40,094
Oh, fuck.
You're right.

330
00:26:40,165 --> 00:26:42,895
Hi.
Sorry we're late.

331
00:26:42,968 --> 00:26:44,902
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

332
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:47,632
- Happy 25th, old lady.
- Oh!

333
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:50,641
How's it going, man?

334
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:52,643
Good.

335
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:55,578
It is really
frickin' good!

336
00:26:55,647 --> 00:26:58,548
Oh, it's good to
see you, man!

337
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:00,448
Yeah, it's good.
Good.

338
00:27:02,487 --> 00:27:06,014
You two,
you look amazing!

339
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:08,082
Oh, how much has
he had to drink?

340
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:11,185
Well, it's been
a long night.

341
00:27:11,262 --> 00:27:14,288
Speaking of which,
why don't, uh...

342
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:16,596
- Yes, let's.
...you and I do the...

343
00:27:16,668 --> 00:27:18,602
- Right.
- Okay.

344
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:22,037
...and you two...
good. All right.

345
00:27:22,107 --> 00:27:24,473
Hey, how's it goin', man?
Two MGDs,

346
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:27,136
Jack on the rocks
and a house red, please.

347
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:29,703
Please tell me that you
locked down the strippers.

348
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:33,083
The strippers?

349
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:35,915
For my bachelor party.

350
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:38,581
Your bachelor party?

351
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:43,953
Because... you two
are getting married,

352
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:46,589
and I'm...
the best man.

353
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:49,657
Which means I would have
locked down the strippers.

354
00:27:49,734 --> 00:27:52,532
Of course I did,
dumb-ass!

355
00:27:52,604 --> 00:27:54,538
- You're scaring me, man.
- Dude, I got the...

356
00:27:54,606 --> 00:27:57,370
10 hottest
strippers ever.

357
00:27:58,543 --> 00:28:00,943
10?

358
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:03,742
Awesome! Thanks.
Thank you.

359
00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:05,806
I am...

360
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:10,649
I am so psyched
foryou guys!

361
00:28:10,722 --> 00:28:12,713
Oh. Okay.

362
00:29:01,005 --> 00:29:03,838
Do you still think
you're dreaming?

363
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:08,038
Baby, what's wrong?
Baby, what's wrong?

364
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:10,604
Nothing.

365
00:29:43,214 --> 00:29:45,808
- I love you.
- I love you.

366
00:29:52,223 --> 00:29:54,714
- Oh god.
- All right, baby.

367
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:47,173
"Migraines have been linked
to seizures in recent studies.

368
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:49,509
Patients with a high frequency
of migraine attacks

369
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:52,243
are at greater risk
for cerebral strokes.

370

This progressive brain disease

acute and selected
memory loss.

Behavior changes might

00:31:01,226 --> 00:31:04,457
delusions, hallucinations, hearing
things that are not actually present..."

374

"Schizophrenia refers to

375
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:34,516
"Studies have shown the disease
to be genetically linked,

376

which in its end stages
can result in suicide."

377
00:32:02,053 --> 00:32:04,851
Hey!
How ya feelin'?

378
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:07,721
Oh, busted.
Looking at porn. Again.

379
00:32:07,792 --> 00:32:09,089
- Yeah.
- By the way,

380
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,787
you were really
fucked up last night, man.

381
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:12,989
Yeah, I had
a couple of drinks.

382
00:32:13,064 --> 00:32:15,430
- Yeah, a couple.
- Um...

383
00:32:17,802 --> 00:32:20,703
What?

384
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:24,037
Hey, guys. Bristol just called
a staff meeting.

385
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:25,769
Conference room, five minutes.

386
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:27,470
Oh, God. What does
that prick want now?

387
00:32:27,545 --> 00:32:30,378
I don't know, but he wants to see you
in his office beforehand.

388
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:34,009
What?
Oh. Oh, guys?

389
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:37,077
I think I can already
feel his foot up my ass.

390
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:40,983
All right, people,
let's get right to it.

391
00:32:43,094 --> 00:32:44,618
You've all heard me warn you
about the problems

392
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:46,789
of the average start-up company.

393
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:50,231
Well, it seems that we've been on
the losing end this week.

394
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:52,565
I had five deals
fall through,

395
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:55,128
including R.S.B.
Financial.

396
00:32:55,206 --> 00:32:57,197
That's...

397
00:32:57,275 --> 00:32:59,903
That's Trevor's account.
He said it was a sure thing.

398
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:02,003
Well,
he was wrong.

399
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,911
And unfortunately,
Mr. Callahan felt

400
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:06,246
like he had to send
a message on this one.

401
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:08,410
We've had to let
Trevor go.

402
00:33:11,456 --> 00:33:13,788
So I suggest that we all
get back to work, hmm?

403
00:33:15,593 --> 00:33:18,619
Doesn't that seem
a little harsh?

404
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,191
Yes.

405
00:33:24,268 --> 00:33:26,862
- So what actually happened?
- Excuse me?

406
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:29,133
Well, if Trevorthought

407
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:31,539
it was a sure thing,
why'd the deal fall apart?

408
00:33:34,245 --> 00:33:36,440
Come on, Bristol.

409
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:38,880
You had Trevor's job once,

410
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:41,145
and you know
how hard it is.

411
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:44,052
Yeah, and I worked my ass off,
I didn't make mistakes

412
00:33:44,122 --> 00:33:46,283
and I got rewarded.

413
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:48,689
Why? 'Cause
the Strike Line deal

414
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,160
fell on your lap?

415
00:33:51,229 --> 00:33:54,790
You were supposed to close
the R.S.B. Deal, not Trevor.

416
00:33:56,267 --> 00:33:58,667
And you think you know
something we don't?

417
00:33:58,736 --> 00:34:01,466
What I know

418
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:03,871
is Mr. Callahan pays me
to be the judge of you people,

419
00:34:03,941 --> 00:34:06,205
and right now my judgment is telling me
that you'd much rather be

420
00:34:06,277 --> 00:34:08,404
at home watching "Oprah"
with yourfriend

421
00:34:08,479 --> 00:34:10,310
than working
on this team any longer.

422
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:12,508
Congratulations, Nick.
You're fired too.

423
00:34:13,618 --> 00:34:15,609
Anyone else?

424
00:34:22,293 --> 00:34:25,126
I love you, man,
but this was not your problem.

425
00:34:25,196 --> 00:34:27,391
Fuck that.

426
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:30,332
If it wasn't for us, Bristol wouldn't
have been promoted in the first place.

427
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:32,426
I'm not taking
orders from him.

428
00:34:32,503 --> 00:34:33,936
Nick, you worked your ass
off at this place.

429
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:35,472
You put your blood
into this place, man.

430
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:38,008
Yeah, I put my blood into this place,
and Bristol's the one who gets promoted.

431
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:41,136
Nick, that's business.
You taught me that.

432
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:44,272
Now, look.
Go tell Bristol you're sorry.

433
00:34:44,348 --> 00:34:46,748
Tell him you're still having
side effects from the accident.

434
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:53,721
Only side effect I'm having is knowing
life is way too short forthis.

435
00:34:56,461 --> 00:34:58,395
What is this,
a guy thing?

436
00:34:58,463 --> 00:35:00,761
Trevor gets canned, so you just jump off
the bridge with him?

437
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:03,665
Look, I was never gonna move up with
Bristol as my supervisor anyway.

438
00:35:03,734 --> 00:35:05,463
Ever since the guy got promoted,

439
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:07,663
he's just been looking
for an excuse to fire me.

440
00:35:07,738 --> 00:35:10,332
- Well, you didn't have to give him one.
- You know what? The truth is,

441
00:35:10,408 --> 00:35:12,501
he's the weak link.
He's ruined the whole company,

442
00:35:12,577 --> 00:35:14,636
and everybody knows it.
And you know what?

443
00:35:14,712 --> 00:35:17,180
I am better off
just getting out from under him.

444
00:35:17,248 --> 00:35:19,614
No, Nick.
You're better off with a job.

445
00:35:19,684 --> 00:35:21,709
I told you,
I'll find another one.

446
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:24,516
A better one.
We'll all be okay.

447
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:28,855
You also told me to stay here and not go
to New York, because that would be okay.

448
00:35:28,926 --> 00:35:30,860
I'm sorry,

449
00:35:30,928 --> 00:35:34,227
and ljust can't
forget what we lost in that accident.

450
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:48,078
Hon?

451
00:35:51,949 --> 00:35:53,917
Hey.

452
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:58,452
Hey, it will be.

453
00:35:58,523 --> 00:36:00,718
It just takes time.

454
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:03,726
Nick, it's been a year.

455
00:36:03,794 --> 00:36:08,060
I spend my days cataloguing other
people's photo shoots for minimum wage.

456
00:36:08,132 --> 00:36:11,533
I have half a portfolio
and no time to finish it, and now...

457
00:36:11,602 --> 00:36:14,332
Well, now I have to get
another job so that we can pay our rent.

458
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:16,373
Excuse me.

459
00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:25,712
Hey. Hey.

460
00:36:25,783 --> 00:36:28,343
Hey.

461
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:31,684
It's about the big picture.
I finally see it now.

462
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:35,385
All that other stuff
is just... just stuff.

463
00:36:35,459 --> 00:36:37,757
Look, the only thing
that is important

464
00:36:37,828 --> 00:36:40,820
is that we have
each other.

465
00:36:40,898 --> 00:36:43,458
That's all that counts.

466
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:48,968
Always the salesman,
aren't you?

467
00:37:00,985 --> 00:37:04,443
Mm. Maybe I'll be
a technical copyeditor.

468
00:37:14,265 --> 00:37:18,429
Is that Bristol?
Jerk.

469
00:37:41,525 --> 00:37:43,891
Come on.

470
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:52,436
Nick?

471
00:37:53,871 --> 00:37:55,839
Nick.

472
00:38:03,748 --> 00:38:05,943
- Perfect shot.
- Ah! Great.

473
00:38:06,017 --> 00:38:07,575
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

474
00:38:07,652 --> 00:38:09,279
- Isn't that great?
- You look so good.

475
00:38:09,353 --> 00:38:12,948
Nice.
So, what do you think?

476
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:15,322
- Hmm?
- The ring, honey. Isn't it beautiful?

477
00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:18,021
Can you believe
I picked that thing out myself?

478
00:38:18,095 --> 00:38:20,188
- It's fantastic.
- Ooh.

479
00:38:20,264 --> 00:38:22,323
Yeah.
Sure, it's beautiful.

480
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,891
We're thinking
next October.

481
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:27,733
Oh, how many people
are you gonna invite?

482
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:31,366
You know, maybe 50.
Just the important ones.

483
00:38:31,442 --> 00:38:33,205
- Mmm.
- Ah. Right.

484
00:38:33,277 --> 00:38:36,110
- Dave Bristol.
- What?

485
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:38,171
From your office?

486
00:38:38,249 --> 00:38:41,912
Yeah, right. Like I'd
invite that tool.

487
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:45,217
Looks like I'm out.
Anyone else need more?

488
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:47,450
Oh, no, honey.

489
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:53,793
Bristol,
merry Christmas.

490
00:38:53,864 --> 00:38:56,162
Merry Christmas.

491
00:39:08,446 --> 00:39:10,676
Oh, come on, Nick!

492
00:39:10,748 --> 00:39:13,581
- What are you doing?
- Bristol, I'm sorry, man.

493
00:39:13,651 --> 00:39:16,017
What a klutz.
Can l...

494
00:39:16,087 --> 00:39:18,521
Nice.
That's really nice.

495
00:39:18,589 --> 00:39:20,181
Oh, man.

496
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:21,884
Oh, that's embarrassing,

497
00:39:21,959 --> 00:39:23,358
so embarrassing.

498
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,588
No way.

499
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:21,931
Hey, Nick.

500
00:42:22,006 --> 00:42:23,997
I know you need
those spreadsheets.

501
00:42:24,074 --> 00:42:26,269
I'm just waiting on some numbers
from the clients.

502
00:42:29,813 --> 00:42:32,213
Holy shit.

503
00:42:32,283 --> 00:42:34,808
I'm the vice president.

504
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:38,719
Uh, yeah, of course.
I'm not trying to make excuses.

505
00:42:38,789 --> 00:42:41,121
I pulled the Strike Line
deal, not you.

506
00:42:41,191 --> 00:42:43,751
I'm sorry.
I'm just not following this.

507
00:42:45,195 --> 00:42:47,129
Where's Trevor?

508
00:42:47,197 --> 00:42:51,133
At some off-site client meeting.
He said you knew about it.

509
00:42:51,201 --> 00:42:54,728
Oh, yeah, right.
Thanks.

510
00:42:54,805 --> 00:42:59,105
Oh, and Bristol, clean up that desk.
It's a mess.

511
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:08,609
I swear, if I get
one more S.E.C. Notice,

512
00:43:08,686 --> 00:43:12,588
I am gonna burn the whole stack and move
this thing to the Caymans.

513
00:43:12,656 --> 00:43:14,590
Well, I hear
the weather's nice there.

514
00:43:14,658 --> 00:43:18,389
Yeah, I guess.
So how you feelin'?

515
00:43:18,462 --> 00:43:21,920
Oh, betterthan ever.

516
00:43:21,999 --> 00:43:24,263
Listen, I'm having dinner
with a potential investor.

517
00:43:24,335 --> 00:43:26,326
He's a big one.
We need him.

518
00:43:26,403 --> 00:43:28,371
You know what they say
about start-ups.

519
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:31,474
I want you riding shotgun.

520
00:43:31,542 --> 00:43:34,136
I wouldn't miss it
forthe world, Mr. Callahan.

521
00:43:34,211 --> 00:43:37,374
"Mr. Callahan."
That's cute.

522
00:44:14,918 --> 00:44:17,944
The weather burns in you

523
00:44:18,022 --> 00:44:21,253
I can't predict the rain

524
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,551
The silence falls...

525
00:44:25,629 --> 00:44:27,722
"Pacific Avenue."

526
00:44:27,798 --> 00:44:30,494
You've reached Julie Miller
Photography.

527
00:44:30,567 --> 00:44:32,797
I can't take your call,
so please leave a message,

528
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:35,703
including your phone number
and the date you'd like to book.

529
00:44:35,773 --> 00:44:37,707
Thank you.

530
00:44:37,775 --> 00:44:40,744
Well, hello there,
Julie Miller Photography.

531
00:44:40,811 --> 00:44:43,109
It's Nick Larson calling,

532
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:47,139
and the date I would like to book is for
tonight after my client meeting,

533
00:44:47,217 --> 00:44:49,276
which hopefully won't
last too long.

534
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:51,150
So why don't you
give me a call back

535
00:44:51,221 --> 00:44:53,485
and let me know if that works
foryour schedule?

536
00:44:53,557 --> 00:44:57,049
Unless of course I see you at home
first. All right. I love you, babe.

537
00:45:05,436 --> 00:45:07,404
Honey, I'm home!

538
00:45:12,076 --> 00:45:14,010
No.

539
00:45:23,654 --> 00:45:25,622
What?

540
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:42,866
Hey, Nick, it's Mom.
I hope you're okay.

541
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:45,170
I'd say so.

542
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:48,302
Call me. I haven't seen you for weeks.
I know you're busy,

543
00:45:48,378 --> 00:45:51,006
but let me know
how you are.

544
00:46:07,064 --> 00:46:10,261
Atoast... to
successful partnerships.

545
00:46:10,334 --> 00:46:12,268
- Salud.
- Salud.

546
00:46:12,336 --> 00:46:15,362
Your daughter is
charming and beautiful.

547
00:46:16,807 --> 00:46:19,275
Thank you.

548
00:46:19,343 --> 00:46:22,437
Mm. And what
about you, Nick?

549
00:46:22,513 --> 00:46:24,879
Do you have
family here?

550
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:27,109
Uh, just my mom.
Yeah.

551
00:46:27,184 --> 00:46:30,210
My, uh... my father moved away
when I was a kid.

552
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:32,653
Ah. I am very sorry
to hearthat.

553
00:46:34,424 --> 00:46:36,551
Well, it seems that
you turned out all right.

554
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:39,152
You have certainly made
an impression on your boss.

555
00:46:39,229 --> 00:46:40,753
Oh, well...

556
00:46:40,831 --> 00:46:42,992
Nick's had a bit of
a magic touch lately.

557
00:46:43,066 --> 00:46:46,832
Well, ljust try to keep
things simple, you know?

558
00:46:46,904 --> 00:46:49,372
Know what you want
and try to make that happen.

559
00:46:49,439 --> 00:46:51,964
And if that doesn't work out,
you steal the file

560
00:46:52,042 --> 00:46:54,340
from the guy sitting next to you
and hope that one's a winner.

561
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:59,540
All right, Nick.
Well, let's get serious for a minute

562
00:46:59,616 --> 00:47:03,313
and tell Mr. Fuentes
about the new numbers.

563
00:47:05,055 --> 00:47:08,024
Now? Oh, we're having
such a good time.

564
00:47:08,091 --> 00:47:10,685
The new numbers,
Nick.

565
00:47:10,761 --> 00:47:14,026
We're about to ask
Mr. Fuentes for a large amount of money.

566
00:47:14,097 --> 00:47:16,622
You have to dazzle
the wallet out of his pocket

567
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:19,362
and make it dance
on the table.

568
00:47:19,436 --> 00:47:22,837
No, really, Ron, you take the glory.
This is your baby.

569
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:26,369
The numbers, Nick.

570
00:47:29,112 --> 00:47:32,275
Well, what we're, uh...
we're really talking about

571
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:34,783
is, uh...

572
00:47:38,488 --> 00:47:41,582
the next generation of
hand-held operating systems.

573
00:47:45,095 --> 00:47:48,030
Our software capitalizes
on optical internet protocol,

574
00:47:48,098 --> 00:47:50,623
using light-wave
architectures for processing

575
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:53,602
so that it will send and receive data
over multiple wavelengths.

576
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:55,831
Our system can be commercialized
within six months,

577
00:47:55,906 --> 00:47:58,466
and with a working beta product
and your company's backing,

578
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:02,069
we can expect to sign one,
maybe two of the incumbents.

579
00:48:02,145 --> 00:48:04,477
Then we'll minimize
ourfront-end expenditures

580
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:06,482
by outsourcing to
a flex manufacturer in China.

581
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:08,711
If we're right,
our product margins will add

582
00:48:08,785 --> 00:48:12,380
500 basis points to your company's
gross margins within 12 months.

583
00:48:12,456 --> 00:48:16,222
Bottom line, if we achieve one-third
of the unit sales forecasted,

584
00:48:16,293 --> 00:48:18,261
we'll double your
company's cash flow.

585
00:48:37,514 --> 00:48:39,482
All right.

586
00:48:42,953 --> 00:48:45,285
Hey.
How's it going?

587
00:48:45,355 --> 00:48:47,721
I'm about to pull out
my hair, I'm so bored.

588
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:52,084
Yeah, it's, uh...

589
00:48:52,162 --> 00:48:54,494
sorry for all
the technobabble.

590
00:48:54,564 --> 00:48:58,330
Actually, you know,
that's the part that got me hot.

591
00:48:58,402 --> 00:48:59,562
Grace?

592
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:02,104
Oh Jesus.

593
00:49:02,172 --> 00:49:04,265
What are you doing?

594
00:49:04,341 --> 00:49:06,468
Baby, it's been
a week.

595
00:49:06,543 --> 00:49:08,704
What, you want me
to beg for it?

596
00:49:10,981 --> 00:49:14,644
Whoa. Hey. Hey hey hey.
We're in a restaurant.

597
00:49:15,819 --> 00:49:18,515
When has that ever
stopped you before?

598
00:49:27,898 --> 00:49:30,162
Oh fuck.

599
00:49:30,233 --> 00:49:32,201
Hold up.
Your dad's right outside.

600
00:49:32,269 --> 00:49:34,203
I don't care about that,
and neither does he.

601
00:49:34,271 --> 00:49:37,035
Besides, I'll just tell him
to give you another raise.

602
00:49:41,745 --> 00:49:43,713
Oh, Nick!

603
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:56,225
- I want you, Nick.
- I hearyou.

604
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:07,170
Yeah.

605
00:50:28,425 --> 00:50:30,586
Yeah!

606
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:51,912
Oh my God.
What are you doing?

607
00:50:51,982 --> 00:50:54,246
Let's have some fun here.

608
00:50:54,317 --> 00:50:57,013
Smile, baby.

609
00:50:57,087 --> 00:50:59,555
Uh-uh. Hey...

610
00:50:59,623 --> 00:51:02,057
- I'll be in touch.
- You're most welcome.

611
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:07,663
You did great, Nick.
Thanks for coming.

612
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:10,222
Yeah, Nick.
Thanks for coming.

613
00:51:18,809 --> 00:51:23,007
Here I am
to let you know

614
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:26,846
Take it back
and let it slow

615
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:30,182
Take it back
and let it slow

616
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:37,220
Lust away from
all that ends

617
00:51:37,294 --> 00:51:40,730
Try to keep
all amends

618
00:51:40,797 --> 00:51:44,255
Try to keep all amends

619
00:51:47,704 --> 00:51:52,732
Your home

620
00:51:52,809 --> 00:51:55,107
You hardly know it...

621
00:52:10,894 --> 00:52:12,486
- Oh! Jesus!
- Where were you?

622
00:52:12,562 --> 00:52:14,029
I was waiting fortwo hours.

623
00:52:14,097 --> 00:52:16,327
Trevor, settle down, man.
I was at dinner with Callahan.

624
00:52:16,399 --> 00:52:18,333
What? I told you,
we need to talk.

625
00:52:18,401 --> 00:52:21,199
All right.
What's going on?

626
00:52:21,271 --> 00:52:24,934
I've got a problem with
one of my investors.

627
00:52:25,008 --> 00:52:27,568
- Who?
- Malcolm.

628
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:32,172
- "Malcolm"?
- Are you playing with me?

629
00:52:32,249 --> 00:52:36,015
Malcolm, from the club.
We took his money. You closed the deal.

630
00:52:36,086 --> 00:52:38,247
- Is your head fucked? Come on!
- Malcolm, of course.

631
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:39,754
Yes. What's up?
What's going on?

632
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:43,281
The money...
h-he-he... he wants it back.

633
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:45,988
- All right. How much?
- All of it.

634
00:52:46,062 --> 00:52:48,622
- 250 grand.
- "250 grand"?

635
00:52:51,968 --> 00:52:55,665
- Did he do that to you?
- It was one of his guys, as a reminder.

636
00:52:55,739 --> 00:52:57,969
Just listen.
Listen to me, Nick.

637
00:52:58,041 --> 00:52:59,906
You've got to make
this happen, man, okay?

638
00:52:59,976 --> 00:53:01,637
'Cause I can't mess
around with this guy.

639
00:53:01,711 --> 00:53:03,201
I-I-I can't make him
wait anymore.

640
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:06,044
Hey, Trevor...

641
00:53:06,116 --> 00:53:08,676
I'll talk to Ron.
I'll take care of it.

642
00:53:08,752 --> 00:53:11,846
It's no big deal.
All right?

643
00:53:11,922 --> 00:53:14,584
- Yeah. Yeah, all right.
- All right, okay.

644
00:53:14,658 --> 00:53:18,025
- I owe you my life, man.
- No no. Dude.

645
00:53:19,129 --> 00:53:21,154
- It's all right.
- All right.

646
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,464
Hey.

647
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:28,527
You, uh... you talk
to Julie lately?

648
00:53:28,605 --> 00:53:31,335
No. Not in a while.
Why?

649
00:53:31,408 --> 00:53:33,569
I'm having a hard time
tracking her down.

650
00:53:33,643 --> 00:53:35,167
Dude.

651
00:53:35,245 --> 00:53:38,043
You told me last time,
you're done with her, right?

652
00:53:41,017 --> 00:53:43,178
See you later.

653
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:26,824
Ron.
How's it going, man?

654
00:54:26,896 --> 00:54:29,831
For shit.
Fuentes bailed.

655
00:54:29,899 --> 00:54:31,867
What? You got to
be kidding me.

656
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:33,960
After last night
I thought we had him.

657
00:54:34,037 --> 00:54:36,164
Yeah, well, fuck him.
His mistake.

658
00:54:36,239 --> 00:54:38,571
Oh, Jesus!

659
00:54:41,511 --> 00:54:43,536
Listen, I hate to
pile on, man, but, um,

660
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:46,275
it seems we have a problem
with one of our investors.

661
00:54:46,349 --> 00:54:48,544
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

662
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:51,314
Guy Trevor brought in back
in July, gave us 250 grand?

663
00:54:51,388 --> 00:54:55,017
Anyway, he says, uh...
he says he wants it back.

664
00:54:57,661 --> 00:55:00,824
- That's it?
- Yeah.

665
00:55:00,897 --> 00:55:02,831
That's pocket change.

666
00:55:02,899 --> 00:55:05,868
Why don't you just go get the checkbook
off my desk and write it yourself?

667
00:55:05,935 --> 00:55:09,996
Ron, thank you so much, man.
I knew you'd understand.

668
00:55:10,073 --> 00:55:12,564
Why don't you write
a few more while you're at it?

669
00:55:12,642 --> 00:55:15,167
I mean, just go down to the corner
and pass 'em out with milk and cookies.

670
00:55:15,245 --> 00:55:17,008
I mean, if you really
want to give some money away.

671
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:19,674
It's not like that, man.

672
00:55:19,749 --> 00:55:22,240
Nick,
we have contracts

673
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:24,378
that specify how and when
people get paid back.

674
00:55:24,454 --> 00:55:27,890
I know. I understand.
Look, it is a one-time thing.

675
00:55:27,957 --> 00:55:30,152
I'll make it up to you
on the next deal.

676
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:35,961
I don't get it. Were you asleep for our
entire conversation yesterday?

677
00:55:38,268 --> 00:55:40,259
Which... which one?

678
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:42,703
The one where
I told you we're broke.

679
00:55:44,641 --> 00:55:48,133
- What?
- Nick, the money is gone.

680
00:55:48,211 --> 00:55:50,441
No matter how many times
we go over it, it is gone.

681
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:53,505
We've spent it...
everything we had and more.

682
00:55:55,151 --> 00:55:58,211
- Ron, that's not possible.
- You wouldn't think so,

683
00:55:58,288 --> 00:56:00,813
but somehow we managed
to pull it off.

684
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:05,428
What about
the Strike Line deal?

685
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:12,668
Nick, you're
a good salesman.

686
00:56:12,736 --> 00:56:15,432
You've done a lot of
great things for my company.

687
00:56:15,505 --> 00:56:17,939
I'm glad I made you v.P.,

688
00:56:18,007 --> 00:56:21,033
but let's face it...
you blew it on that one.

689
00:56:25,315 --> 00:56:27,306
What are you
talking about?

690
00:56:28,551 --> 00:56:30,576
You approached them
during Christmas.

691
00:56:30,653 --> 00:56:32,587
We weren't ready.

692
00:56:32,655 --> 00:56:35,351
No matter how you look at it, Nick, you
scared them off. That's the truth.

693
00:56:39,095 --> 00:56:41,120
I didn't make
the Strike Line deal.

694
00:56:41,197 --> 00:56:43,893
Hell, you know,
if... if we had just nailed that deal,

695
00:56:43,967 --> 00:56:46,595
we'd actually probably have some
working software right now

696
00:56:46,669 --> 00:56:49,069
instead of this
pile of garbage.

697
00:56:56,679 --> 00:56:59,409
Hey.

698
00:56:59,482 --> 00:57:02,576
- So what's the story?
- Still working on it.

699
00:57:02,652 --> 00:57:06,645
Nick, come on, man.
I'm meeting Malcolm tonight.

700
00:57:06,723 --> 00:57:10,215
Hey. I'm gonna
take care of it.

701
00:57:13,229 --> 00:57:15,754
Okay.

702
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:23,834
Julie.
Hey, it's, uh...

703
00:57:23,907 --> 00:57:26,068
it's me, Nick, again.

704
00:57:26,142 --> 00:57:28,235
Um...

705
00:57:28,311 --> 00:57:31,838
listen, I know that
there's some stuff between us,

706
00:57:31,915 --> 00:57:35,146
and you're obviously
not calling me back, but...

707
00:57:35,218 --> 00:57:38,187
I'd really like
to talk to you.

708
00:57:38,254 --> 00:57:41,052
Happy belated birthday,
and, uh...

709
00:57:42,659 --> 00:57:44,627
I miss you.

710
00:58:05,915 --> 00:58:08,179
- Hello?
- Nick. Finally.

711
00:58:08,251 --> 00:58:10,412
- Oh, hey, Mom.
- How are you?

712
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:13,217
Fine, uh, what's up?

713
00:58:13,289 --> 00:58:16,816
I've spoken to yourfather's doctor.
He'd like to see you.

714
00:58:16,893 --> 00:58:18,986
Will you talk to him?

715
00:58:20,096 --> 00:58:22,496
Why? What...
what do you mean?

716
00:58:22,565 --> 00:58:26,262
I'm concerned about you.
I really want to come and see you.

717
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:29,703
- No no, I'm good, Mom. I'm fine.
- No, I really...

718
00:58:29,772 --> 00:58:31,433
Hey, listen, I got to go, okay?
I'll call you later.

719
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:33,442
- Nick...
- I love you.

720
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:35,478
Bye.

721
00:58:49,993 --> 00:58:52,928
Let me see.
Oh, looks good, huh?

722
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:12,908
Julie.

723
01:00:15,545 --> 01:00:18,013
Hey.

724
01:00:18,081 --> 01:00:20,140
Wow, I...

725
01:00:20,216 --> 01:00:22,411
hardly recognized you,
you look so different.

726
01:00:22,485 --> 01:00:24,885
Uh, thanks,
I think.

727
01:00:24,954 --> 01:00:27,718
No, I mean,
you look beautiful.

728
01:00:29,993 --> 01:00:32,461
Um, I left you a bunch of messages.
Did you get 'em?

729
01:00:32,528 --> 01:00:35,053
Yeah, I got 'em.

730
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:37,122
Okay.

731
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:39,191
I'm sorry.
I know I...

732
01:00:39,268 --> 01:00:42,726
I got a little carried away.
Ljust really wanted to talk to you.

733
01:00:42,805 --> 01:00:46,468
Well, I'm standing here,
so go ahead.

734
01:00:46,542 --> 01:00:50,672
Um...
What are you doing?

735
01:00:50,747 --> 01:00:54,012
- I'm working.
- At a club?

736
01:00:54,083 --> 01:00:57,143
Yeah, at a club.
I'm shooting a fashion show.

737
01:00:57,220 --> 01:01:01,088
Well, that's cool.
Who hooked that up?

738
01:01:01,157 --> 01:01:05,150
Christopher. He introduced
me to a few people and it just took off.

739
01:01:05,228 --> 01:01:07,162
Wow.
Who's Christopher?

740
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:08,925
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.

741
01:01:08,998 --> 01:01:11,057
- You call me?
- I did.

742
01:01:11,134 --> 01:01:13,796
- And who's this?
- Oh, uh, Nick.

743
01:01:13,870 --> 01:01:16,031
Old friend.
We're just catching up.

744
01:01:16,105 --> 01:01:19,802
Nick, she's the greatest, isn't she?
She's gonna be a star, aren't you, baby?

745
01:01:19,876 --> 01:01:21,810
Listen, I'm gonna
get another drink.

746
01:01:21,878 --> 01:01:23,311
- Can I get you something?
- Sure.

747
01:01:23,379 --> 01:01:25,506
- Nick?
- No, I'm good.

748
01:01:25,581 --> 01:01:27,071
All right

749
01:01:32,889 --> 01:01:34,823
Julie.
Julie.

750
01:01:34,891 --> 01:01:37,257
Listen,

751
01:01:37,326 --> 01:01:39,453
I know some stuff
went wrong with us,

752
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:43,465
but you have to believe me, I never
meant for it to end up like this.

753
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:45,524
Oh, cut the shit, Nick.
You know what?

754
01:01:45,601 --> 01:01:47,432
You got everything exactly
the way you wanted it,

755
01:01:47,503 --> 01:01:49,061
so don't start caring
about me now.

756
01:01:49,138 --> 01:01:51,629
I am telling you,
whatever I said,

757
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:53,801
whatever I did, whatever...
happened between us,

758
01:01:53,876 --> 01:01:56,140
just... just wipe it
out of your head.

759
01:01:56,212 --> 01:01:59,739
Don't you get it?
I already have.

760
01:01:59,816 --> 01:02:03,149
You know, and all yourtalk
about your job

761
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:05,449
and my career,
the future,

762
01:02:05,521 --> 01:02:08,547
that's all it was,
Nick... talk.

763
01:02:08,624 --> 01:02:10,421
And now
I'm my own boss,

764
01:02:10,493 --> 01:02:13,951
and forthe first time
I'm doing exactly what I want to do.

765
01:02:14,030 --> 01:02:16,123
No, you're not.

766
01:02:18,034 --> 01:02:20,229
I know what you want,
and it's not this.

767
01:02:21,437 --> 01:02:23,598
- Things change.
- Not us.

768
01:02:23,673 --> 01:02:27,200
Julie, we can
start over.

769
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:30,136
Just give me a chance.

770
01:02:35,017 --> 01:02:38,180
- That's her, isn't it?
- Who?

771
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:42,725
Grace.

772
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:46,951
Julie, no.

773
01:02:47,029 --> 01:02:49,896
You are the only thing
in this world that matters to me.

774
01:02:49,966 --> 01:02:52,833
I don't know how
I lost sight of that.

775
01:02:52,902 --> 01:02:55,029
I can fix this.

776
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:57,470
I promise you I will.

777
01:02:58,574 --> 01:03:00,974
Always the salesman,
aren't you?

778
01:03:05,014 --> 01:03:06,982
Hey...

779
01:03:15,925 --> 01:03:17,984
Nick.
Oh, thank God.

780
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:19,994
See, I told you
he'd show.

781
01:03:20,062 --> 01:03:21,529
I'm really glad
you could make it, Nick.

782
01:03:21,597 --> 01:03:23,258
- Malcolm, I assume.
- Yeah,

783
01:03:23,332 --> 01:03:26,324
- good to meet you face to face finally.
- And you.

784
01:03:26,402 --> 01:03:28,962
This is Wayne.
He owns half the club with me.

785
01:03:29,038 --> 01:03:31,632
Wayne?
Nick.

786
01:03:31,707 --> 01:03:33,698
Good luck.

787
01:03:36,712 --> 01:03:38,680
Have a seat.

788
01:03:45,388 --> 01:03:47,356
All right.

789
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:53,159
Malcolm, this space
is fantastic.

790
01:03:53,229 --> 01:03:55,595
Thank you very much.

791
01:04:00,036 --> 01:04:03,437
Here we go.
A little black tea

792
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:06,031
with ginseng
and mango.

793
01:04:06,108 --> 01:04:08,235
We call it
Chinese rocket fuel.

794
01:04:08,311 --> 01:04:10,245
Keeps you sharp,
mind and body.

795
01:04:10,313 --> 01:04:12,281
It seems to be
working foryou.

796
01:04:14,217 --> 01:04:16,151
I know why
you're here.

797
01:04:16,219 --> 01:04:18,847
You want to renegotiate
your contract.

798
01:04:19,889 --> 01:04:21,618
Yes.

799
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:24,091
Yourfriend made
a lot of promises.

800
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:26,856
Said he could get me in on the ground
floor, triple my money with some sort of

801
01:04:26,929 --> 01:04:29,625
turbocharged
super-phone software,

802
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:32,293
and I'm no expert,
but it sounded pretty good.

803
01:04:32,368 --> 01:04:34,598
And it is, Malcolm.

804
01:04:34,670 --> 01:04:36,604
That's all true.

805
01:04:36,672 --> 01:04:40,108
It is an excellent product. I'm sure
your investment will see a great return.

806
01:04:40,176 --> 01:04:43,304
Malcolm, I'm not sure what
it is you're looking for,

807
01:04:43,379 --> 01:04:46,212
but if you look at your contract, you'll
see we're well within ourtimeline.

808
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:49,877
Okay,
but at some time,

809
01:04:49,952 --> 01:04:53,149
I need to feel like there's some sort
of progress going on.

810
01:04:53,222 --> 01:04:57,056
Okay. Well, how can I
help you feel like that?

811
01:04:58,861 --> 01:05:00,829
See, we're part
of an organization.

812
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:03,627
There's a chain of command.
It's the way things are done.

813
01:05:03,699 --> 01:05:06,031
Which is why we sign
contracts that specify

814
01:05:06,102 --> 01:05:08,229
how and when people
are paid back.

815
01:05:08,304 --> 01:05:11,933
You're a businessman.
You know how the whole thing works.

816
01:05:18,381 --> 01:05:20,611
Have you ever wished you could look
into the future?

817
01:05:22,518 --> 01:05:25,783
The Chinese believe it's possible just
by looking at a pattern of tea leaves.

818
01:05:25,855 --> 01:05:29,018
So... the question is,

819
01:05:30,293 --> 01:05:32,727
do I see a waterfall

820
01:05:32,795 --> 01:05:35,263
dripping with all the money
you guys are gonna make me?

821
01:05:36,465 --> 01:05:38,763
Or, uh,

822
01:05:38,834 --> 01:05:41,496
do I see a little bonfire
cooking as everything

823
01:05:41,570 --> 01:05:43,561
- I gave you goes up in smoke?
- That's not it, Malcolm.

824
01:05:43,639 --> 01:05:45,300
Well, I'm dying foryou
to prove me otherwise.

825
01:05:46,709 --> 01:05:48,836
I think I can help.

826
01:05:48,911 --> 01:05:51,141
Because of your
relationship with Trevor

827
01:05:51,213 --> 01:05:53,147
and my confidence
in this product,

828
01:05:53,215 --> 01:05:55,809
I've written you
a personal check for 10%.

829
01:05:59,822 --> 01:06:03,553
25 thousand
out of 250?

830
01:06:05,594 --> 01:06:07,824
It's a Band-Aid
until your...

831
01:06:07,897 --> 01:06:10,127
your investment
sees its return.

832
01:06:13,669 --> 01:06:16,137
Band-Aids.
I love Band-Aids.

833
01:06:16,205 --> 01:06:18,435
Now, you see?
I told you,

834
01:06:18,507 --> 01:06:22,603
Nick's on this now,
and he's gonna take care of everything.

835
01:06:29,318 --> 01:06:31,343
Well, it's better
than nothing,

836
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:33,411
which is all I've gotten
from you so far.

837
01:06:34,924 --> 01:06:38,382
So, maybe it's time we cut out
the middlemen, right?

838
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:47,067
No!

839
01:06:53,442 --> 01:06:56,275
Get him out.

840
01:07:07,723 --> 01:07:09,714
Nick?

841
01:07:10,793 --> 01:07:14,024
- No!
- What?

842
01:07:14,096 --> 01:07:16,030
Stay in here, okay?

843
01:07:16,098 --> 01:07:18,259
Come on, move, move!
Get out!

844
01:07:18,334 --> 01:07:20,768
Shit!
Get out! Now!

845
01:07:20,836 --> 01:07:23,396
Fuck! Fuck!

846
01:07:23,472 --> 01:07:25,463
Julie?

847
01:07:28,511 --> 01:07:30,445
Julie?

848
01:07:30,513 --> 01:07:32,481
- Nick?
- No!

849
01:07:33,749 --> 01:07:35,842
No, Julie!
Fuck!

850
01:07:35,918 --> 01:07:38,443
- Oh, Julie! Oh, my God!
- What's happening?

851
01:07:38,521 --> 01:07:40,614
Shh. Shh.
I love you, baby.

852
01:07:40,689 --> 01:07:43,123
I love you.
You're okay, okay?

853
01:07:43,192 --> 01:07:45,558
Here. Don't look.
Here here. Hey, look at me.

854
01:07:45,628 --> 01:07:48,927
Look at me, look at me.
Everything's fine. Okay?

855
01:07:48,998 --> 01:07:50,863
You're okay. Shh.

856
01:07:50,933 --> 01:07:52,958
Breathe.

857
01:07:54,904 --> 01:07:57,065
Come on!

858
01:07:57,139 --> 01:07:59,198
Breathe.
Just breathe.

859
01:07:59,275 --> 01:08:01,072
All right.
All right.

860
01:08:37,012 --> 01:08:39,003
Oh, Grace!

861
01:08:44,386 --> 01:08:46,684
Oh, God.

862
01:08:49,558 --> 01:08:50,991
Found something that
would wake you up.

863
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:52,994
What the fuck?

864
01:08:53,062 --> 01:08:56,031
Relax.
You're enjoying it.

865
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:00,000
Your shit's on the floor.

866
01:09:08,644 --> 01:09:11,738
You want something
to drink?

867
01:09:18,921 --> 01:09:21,014
Who are you?

868
01:09:21,090 --> 01:09:23,183
Huh?

869
01:09:23,259 --> 01:09:26,319
How did I get here?

870
01:09:29,231 --> 01:09:32,359
You are
so bloody cute.

871
01:09:35,337 --> 01:09:38,431
- Answerthe question.
- Get your hands off of me.

872
01:09:41,777 --> 01:09:45,178
You don't remember me?
We met at the club.

873
01:09:45,247 --> 01:09:47,841
Malcolm and I
are partners.

874
01:09:47,917 --> 01:09:51,409
On everything.
Which means I own half your ass.

875
01:09:57,793 --> 01:10:00,921
I understand you
owe us $250,000.

876
01:10:01,997 --> 01:10:04,022
If you hadda behaved yourself,

877
01:10:04,099 --> 01:10:07,193
I could've persuaded Malcolm
into reducing your bill,

878
01:10:07,269 --> 01:10:10,568
but now you're not going anywhere
until he gets here.

879
01:10:10,639 --> 01:10:12,573
Don't you get it?

880
01:10:28,624 --> 01:10:31,787
I'm sure your girlfriend
and Trevor would agree.

881
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:33,794
Fuck you.

882
01:10:40,936 --> 01:10:43,530
I really screwed things up, Mom.

883
01:10:43,606 --> 01:10:47,201
I tried so hard
to fix everything, to just...

884
01:10:47,276 --> 01:10:50,245
make things right, and every time I do
I make it so much worse.

885
01:10:51,614 --> 01:10:53,775
I don't even know
who I am anymore.

886
01:10:53,849 --> 01:10:56,579
Don't. You remind me
of yourfather when you talk like that.

887
01:10:56,652 --> 01:10:59,780
- Why?
- You try to control everything.

888
01:11:03,626 --> 01:11:06,220
Mom, I want
to talk to Dad.

889
01:11:06,295 --> 01:11:08,889
No, you can...
you can't, okay?

890
01:11:08,964 --> 01:11:11,694
You don't understand.
It's really important.

891
01:11:11,767 --> 01:11:14,361
- No, you don't understand.
- Mom, you've gotta help me find him.

892
01:11:14,436 --> 01:11:16,131
Nick, he's dead.

893
01:11:19,475 --> 01:11:21,670
He committed suicide.

894
01:11:24,613 --> 01:11:26,240
Why would you
keep that from me?

895
01:11:26,315 --> 01:11:27,976
I don't know.

896
01:11:28,050 --> 01:11:29,847
I didn't want you
to remember him like that.

897
01:11:29,918 --> 01:11:33,684
The point is, Nick, it's you
I'm worried about.

898
01:11:34,957 --> 01:11:38,222
You can't do this alone.

899
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:41,092
You need to see a doctor.

900
01:11:41,163 --> 01:11:44,291
You don't have to
have the same fate as yourfather.

901
01:11:45,467 --> 01:11:48,402
Nick, you can't
control everything.

902
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:50,631
You have to let it go.

903
01:12:02,418 --> 01:12:04,352
Another drink, please.

904
01:12:09,558 --> 01:12:11,048
Thanks.

905
01:12:13,896 --> 01:12:16,831
Nick.
What's going on?

906
01:12:16,899 --> 01:12:18,958
Oh my God.

907
01:12:19,034 --> 01:12:20,899
What happened to you?

908
01:12:27,409 --> 01:12:29,434
Did you bring it?

909
01:12:36,218 --> 01:12:37,947
Where is Trevor?

910
01:12:40,456 --> 01:12:42,617
I can't believe that
was only a year ago.

911
01:12:42,691 --> 01:12:44,886
I know
something's wrong.

912
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:47,394
First, Trevor comes home
with a black eye.

913
01:12:47,463 --> 01:12:49,693
Then he says you have
some meeting together,

914
01:12:49,765 --> 01:12:51,392
but he doesn't
come home at all.

915
01:12:51,467 --> 01:12:53,799
And now you want me
to bring you some old picture?

916
01:12:57,606 --> 01:13:00,507
Nick, I'm really scared.

917
01:13:00,576 --> 01:13:02,407
I know.

918
01:13:04,847 --> 01:13:07,873
You know that
I'd do anything for Trevor, don't you?

919
01:13:10,586 --> 01:13:13,146
I'd do anything
for all you guys.

920
01:13:15,424 --> 01:13:17,358
Yeah.

921
01:13:18,994 --> 01:13:20,518
Come here.

922
01:13:24,199 --> 01:13:26,258
I know you're scared.

923
01:13:32,741 --> 01:13:34,834
I can't explain it...

924
01:13:36,078 --> 01:13:38,876
but I promise you
that Trevor's okay.

925
01:14:34,336 --> 01:14:35,826
Oh, great, guys.

926
01:14:35,904 --> 01:14:37,735
Check it out...

927
01:14:37,806 --> 01:14:41,003
I brought my own special
birthday candle.

928
01:14:41,076 --> 01:14:42,668
- Yes!
- It's drugs!

929
01:14:42,744 --> 01:14:44,575
Oh! My favorite.

930
01:14:44,646 --> 01:14:46,671
Light it!

931
01:14:50,886 --> 01:14:53,081
- Light it.
- Yes yes.

932
01:14:54,857 --> 01:14:56,791
Where are you going?

933
01:14:56,859 --> 01:14:59,487
- Somewhere.
- Oh, really?

934
01:14:59,561 --> 01:15:01,586
With you.

935
01:15:01,663 --> 01:15:03,392
Okay.

936
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:07,227
I need to talk
to you alone.

937
01:15:07,302 --> 01:15:08,929
Oh.

938
01:15:10,739 --> 01:15:12,673
Put this on,
it might get cold.

939
01:15:12,741 --> 01:15:14,766
Hmm.

940
01:15:19,615 --> 01:15:22,516
Ah. This looks exactly
the same as it did

941
01:15:22,584 --> 01:15:24,552
when you first
brought me here.

942
01:15:25,654 --> 01:15:28,214
I can't believe...
when was that?

943
01:15:28,290 --> 01:15:30,918
- Three years ago.
- Three years ago.

944
01:15:30,993 --> 01:15:32,517
Wow.

945
01:15:34,096 --> 01:15:36,587
I can't imagine my life
without you now.

946
01:15:40,235 --> 01:15:42,135
Nick, I want
to tell you something.

947
01:15:42,204 --> 01:15:43,865
Me first.

948
01:15:43,939 --> 01:15:45,497
Okay.

949
01:15:46,708 --> 01:15:48,403
You need
to go to New York.

950
01:15:50,379 --> 01:15:52,574
- What?
- I know that it sounds strange,

951
01:15:52,648 --> 01:15:54,843
but trust me,
it's forthe best.

952
01:15:54,917 --> 01:15:56,612
Where is this coming from?

953
01:15:56,685 --> 01:15:59,552
This is your chance
to pursue your art,

954
01:15:59,621 --> 01:16:01,612
to... find out
about yourself,

955
01:16:01,690 --> 01:16:04,488
to not have to worry
about me or us or my job

956
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:06,687
or all that
other bullshit, just...

957
01:16:06,762 --> 01:16:08,696
- I don't want to be free.
- Listen to me.

958
01:16:08,764 --> 01:16:11,597
This is
your last chance to...

959
01:16:14,236 --> 01:16:16,761
pursue your own path
in life,

960
01:16:16,838 --> 01:16:18,533
one that
I can't fuck up.

961
01:16:20,342 --> 01:16:23,038
Well, I don't want to pursue
my own path. That wasn't the deal.

962
01:16:23,111 --> 01:16:24,601
- Listen.
- We were going to do this together

963
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:27,171
and we were gonna work it out,
and you promised you would be there.

964
01:16:27,249 --> 01:16:29,809
Just trust me, I know, baby.
I don't think you're getting it.

965
01:16:29,885 --> 01:16:31,443
Julie...

966
01:16:41,096 --> 01:16:44,088
ljust need a little
space myself right now.

967
01:16:47,569 --> 01:16:49,537
I'm sorry.

968
01:16:52,608 --> 01:16:54,576
You're breaking up with me?

969
01:16:56,011 --> 01:16:58,605
- That's it?
- Yeah.

970
01:17:01,350 --> 01:17:04,148
I don't think
there's anything left to be said.

971
01:17:16,598 --> 01:17:18,293
Nick, I'm pregnant.

972
01:17:41,256 --> 01:17:43,121
Trevor.

973
01:17:43,191 --> 01:17:45,455
Where's Julie?

974
01:17:45,527 --> 01:17:47,461
- What happened?
- Yeah, dude, she ran down here,

975
01:17:47,529 --> 01:17:49,690
grabbed your keys
and took off to your car.

976
01:18:01,677 --> 01:18:04,544
No! Oh God!

977
01:18:09,518 --> 01:18:12,009
- All right, here we go.
- Keep going to the point and back.

978
01:18:21,496 --> 01:18:24,158
Hey, man, what are you doing?
That's my car!

979
01:18:51,059 --> 01:18:53,960
Slow down.
Please, slow down.

980
01:18:57,232 --> 01:18:59,359
Oh God.

981
01:19:02,938 --> 01:19:05,133
- Oh, you've got to be kidding.
- Julie!

982
01:19:19,454 --> 01:19:23,015
- God!
- Pull over, Julie, please!

983
01:19:23,091 --> 01:19:24,388
Please, pull over.

984
01:19:24,459 --> 01:19:26,950
I'm sorry!
I love you!

985
01:19:27,028 --> 01:19:29,929
I didn't know!
I'm sorry!

986
01:19:29,998 --> 01:19:33,399
Julie, you have to
pull over!

987
01:19:33,468 --> 01:19:36,096
Pull over!
You don't understand!

988
01:19:36,171 --> 01:19:37,502
Please!

989
01:19:43,411 --> 01:19:45,140
Oh my God.

990
01:19:47,883 --> 01:19:49,680
I love you.

991
01:20:03,965 --> 01:20:06,229
I would do anything
for all you guys.

992
01:20:06,301 --> 01:20:08,633
You know that,
don't you?

993
01:20:44,306 --> 01:20:46,274
Hey, Nick.
You're awake.

994
01:20:47,609 --> 01:20:49,873
Come on, baby,
we've got a big day.

995
01:20:49,945 --> 01:20:51,810
I've got class
in a half-hour.

996
01:20:55,884 --> 01:20:58,216
Ah...

997
01:20:58,286 --> 01:21:00,413
That's right,
Nicky, yeah!

998
01:21:00,488 --> 01:21:02,752
Aw...

999
01:21:02,824 --> 01:21:05,088
Mommy has to go to class
in a half an hour.

1000
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:07,720
That's right. Okay?

1001
01:21:07,796 --> 01:21:10,492
I'm gonna drop you off
at Grandma's. Yeah!

1002
01:21:11,492 --> 01:21:21,492
