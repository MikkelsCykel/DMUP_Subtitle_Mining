-You wanna get somethin' to eat?
-Nah.

3
00:02:22,721 --> 00:02:24,882
I had somethin' last night,
ruined my appetite.

4
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,890
Besides, I gotta get down the road.

5
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:31,427
Okay. Thanks for the ride.

6
00:02:37,869 --> 00:02:40,667
Come on, I'll buy you
a cup of tea and a bromo.

7
00:02:41,873 --> 00:02:45,070
-Come on.
-Okay, but I can only stay a minute.

8
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:46,900
Good.

9
00:02:57,122 --> 00:03:00,216
Okay, we open. Come in.

10
00:03:00,726 --> 00:03:03,160
-Where's the john at?
-In the back.

11
00:03:04,963 --> 00:03:06,897
Gimme a bromo for my friend here.

12
00:03:06,965 --> 00:03:08,990
I'll take a small steak,
two eggs on top...

13
00:03:09,067 --> 00:03:11,467
...some fries, juice,
and a side order of toast....

14
00:03:11,503 --> 00:03:14,301
Yes, sure. Right away.

15
00:03:16,241 --> 00:03:19,301
Look out for that stomach, huh?

16
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:54,968
Here we fix you up one second.
You'll feel much better.

17
00:03:59,751 --> 00:04:01,742
Okay. See you, huh?

18
00:04:12,364 --> 00:04:14,594
We'll have your steak
ready in a minute.

19
00:04:23,542 --> 00:04:25,635
Where's my buddy?

20
00:04:25,777 --> 00:04:26,903
Oh, he left.

21
00:04:26,978 --> 00:04:28,240
He left?

22
00:04:28,313 --> 00:04:31,339
-What are you talkin' about?
-Hey, what's a matter? You okay?

23
00:04:38,657 --> 00:04:41,956
The guy drove off on me.
How are you gonna figure that?

24
00:04:44,162 --> 00:04:47,029
Oh, I think your steak's ready.

25
00:04:53,104 --> 00:04:55,072
Thank you.

26
00:05:11,456 --> 00:05:12,855
Oh, no!

27
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:16,393
-What?
-He took my wallet.

28
00:05:16,628 --> 00:05:19,188
I left the raincoat in the car and....

29
00:05:19,798 --> 00:05:21,527
I can't even pay you for this.

30
00:05:29,074 --> 00:05:31,508
Tell me, where you goin' anyway?

31
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:34,175
-Down to L.A.
-Why?

32
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,179
I was goin' down for a job.
The whole thing's in the wallet.

33
00:05:38,717 --> 00:05:41,413
-What kind of job?
-Phone number...huh?

34
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:43,146
Machinist.

35
00:05:51,363 --> 00:05:52,330
Eat.

36
00:05:52,397 --> 00:05:55,127
-Hey, thanks a lot.
-Eat, you'll feel better.

37
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,568
I'll be right back.

38
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:02,397
You watch.

39
00:06:02,507 --> 00:06:04,407
-Watch what?
-You watch.

40
00:06:04,442 --> 00:06:06,569
I find a new guy for the cars.

41
00:06:11,349 --> 00:06:13,146
How's food? Good?

42
00:06:13,351 --> 00:06:15,342
Very good. Great. Really.

43
00:06:16,922 --> 00:06:19,982
-Nick Papadakis.
-Frank Chambers.

44
00:06:20,258 --> 00:06:21,816
Frank, huh?

45
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,857
You know cars, Frank?

46
00:06:24,262 --> 00:06:25,593
Yeah. Some.

47
00:06:26,031 --> 00:06:28,124
I need mechanic.

48
00:06:29,034 --> 00:06:30,968
-Here?
-Oh, sure. Station.

49
00:06:33,538 --> 00:06:36,166
I'll tell you, though, Nick...

50
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:39,009
...l got friends down in L.A.

51
00:06:40,779 --> 00:06:43,145
I gotta go down in L.A. Thanks.

52
00:06:43,448 --> 00:06:45,643

She cook the food.

54
00:06:52,757 --> 00:06:54,156
The food...

55
00:06:56,194 --> 00:06:57,786
...delicious.

56
00:07:14,846 --> 00:07:17,838
Tell me somethin', Nick,
just a question....

57
00:07:18,883 --> 00:07:20,976
What would you pay a guy?

58
00:07:22,454 --> 00:07:25,685
-Cora, how much we pay last guy?
-Eight dollars.

59
00:07:26,224 --> 00:07:28,215
-And you promised him....
-Eight dollars.

60
00:07:28,293 --> 00:07:30,659
Room, board and you say
you like my wife's cooking.

61
00:07:33,098 --> 00:07:35,760
-Your wife?
-Oh, sure.

62
00:07:42,407 --> 00:07:45,672
Tell you what, Nick.
I got to track my guy down in L.A.

63
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:49,572
If it don't pan out,
I take you up on it.

64
00:07:50,682 --> 00:07:53,310
Well, okay. If we still got it.

65
00:07:57,989 --> 00:08:01,288
And I'll send you some money
in any case for the breakfast.

66
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,152
-Oh, yeah. Do that.
-Okay. Thanks a lot, Nick.

67
00:08:09,501 --> 00:08:10,763
Goodbye, now.

68
00:08:12,437 --> 00:08:13,165
Missus.

69
00:08:50,308 --> 00:08:52,276
Be right with you there.

70
00:08:56,481 --> 00:08:59,382
Here's a change, 20 cents.
Thank you very much.

71
00:09:00,318 --> 00:09:02,718
What you need, Mr. Papadakis,
is more coverage.

72
00:09:02,787 --> 00:09:04,652
I hadda lass year.

73
00:09:04,722 --> 00:09:06,587
Last year you had fire,
theft, no liability.

74
00:09:06,658 --> 00:09:07,852
So what I need it now for?

75
00:09:07,926 --> 00:09:10,019
Well, you should've had it then.

76
00:09:10,095 --> 00:09:13,064
Suppose a customer comes in here and
there's a spot of grease on the floor?

77
00:09:13,465 --> 00:09:15,126
No, I'm sorry.
There's no grease onna floor.

78
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,533
-No, I'm just sayin' suppose.
-No. You suppose-a something else.

79
00:09:29,447 --> 00:09:32,712
-What are you doing here?
-I come lookin' for some hand soap.

80
00:09:33,284 --> 00:09:35,844
I don't have any hand soap here.

81
00:09:36,621 --> 00:09:38,953
You got anything in the kitchen
I could use?

82
00:09:39,124 --> 00:09:41,115
Go use the station john.

83
00:09:42,427 --> 00:09:44,395
I'd just get it dirty.

84
00:09:49,968 --> 00:09:53,199
I'll tell him to get you some
the next time he goes in.

85
00:09:54,672 --> 00:09:56,640
Sorry to bother you.

86
00:10:04,883 --> 00:10:07,044
You want a cup of coffee?

87
00:10:08,887 --> 00:10:10,718
Yeah, thanks.

88
00:10:12,457 --> 00:10:14,891
A nice place you got here,
Mrs. Papadukis.

89
00:10:16,628 --> 00:10:18,095
Papadakis.

90
00:10:19,164 --> 00:10:21,257
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

91
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,099
Papadakis.

92
00:10:26,804 --> 00:10:29,329
What are you, Greek or somethin'?

93
00:10:30,942 --> 00:10:32,637
What...do I look Greek to you?

94
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,412
No.

95
00:10:43,288 --> 00:10:44,516
Thanks.

96
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:48,619
So...

97
00:10:50,461 --> 00:10:52,292
...what do I call ya?

98
00:10:56,434 --> 00:10:58,459
I guess you can call me Cora.

99
00:11:01,573 --> 00:11:04,599
A man, every man,
needs to have a home.

100
00:11:11,649 --> 00:11:14,379
-You travel, huh?
-Sure.

101
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,251
It's okay.

102
00:11:17,655 --> 00:11:19,885
But you know, the time come....

103
00:11:20,858 --> 00:11:22,849
The time come!

104
00:11:26,364 --> 00:11:28,594
Close the door, it is windy.

105
00:11:31,369 --> 00:11:34,202
Cora, give the man some wine.

106
00:11:35,306 --> 00:11:38,639
-It's in the cupboard if he wants it.
-Nice coffee, Missus.

107
00:11:39,744 --> 00:11:41,644
When the times comes....

108
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,143
I used to travel a lot, too.

109
00:11:44,882 --> 00:11:46,713
I was a young idiot.

110
00:11:46,951 --> 00:11:48,782
I know you...sit down.

111
00:11:50,688 --> 00:11:52,747
I know you travelin' men.

112
00:11:53,491 --> 00:11:54,753
I was, too.

113
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:58,492
Oh, sure. I've been everyplace.
I speak six language.

114
00:11:59,097 --> 00:12:01,930
-No kiddin'.
-Oh, yes, sure.

115
00:12:03,401 --> 00:12:05,926
Go get the wine, huh?

116
00:12:07,005 --> 00:12:09,701
Ah, language. Watch this.

117
00:12:16,781 --> 00:12:19,306
You know what that is?

118
00:12:19,984 --> 00:12:21,110
What?

119
00:12:25,023 --> 00:12:26,991
You know what it means, that?

120
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:29,622
No.

121
00:12:32,664 --> 00:12:37,101
I know, you never make fun
of a man talk funny.

122
00:12:37,168 --> 00:12:40,137
I talk English
better than she talk Greek.

123
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,970
You know, Frank, this-a country...

124
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:47,644
...there's no...

125
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,878
...there's no...ideas here.

126
00:12:54,185 --> 00:12:56,710
Opportunity, oh yes.

127
00:13:04,128 --> 00:13:05,993
There is no happiness.

128
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:15,563
Frank, Frank come here!
Hurry up! Quick!

129
00:14:16,067 --> 00:14:18,058
Hurry up! Look!
Look at his!

130
00:14:24,542 --> 00:14:26,510
Goddamn son of a bitch thief.

131
00:14:27,245 --> 00:14:29,839
Here, pick 'em up. Here.

132
00:14:31,849 --> 00:14:33,908
-Hold on. You got 'em?
-Where are we goin'?

133
00:14:33,985 --> 00:14:36,078
We go here. Put 'em up on post.

134
00:14:36,554 --> 00:14:38,044
You got it?

135
00:14:40,992 --> 00:14:43,460
Push. Push.

136
00:14:51,102 --> 00:14:52,501
Know what I'd do, Nick?

137
00:14:53,905 --> 00:14:56,271
-I'd get a new one.
-Oh, I get new one, sure.

138
00:14:56,874 --> 00:14:59,172
And that son of a bitch
hang it first time, he pay for it.

139
00:14:59,243 --> 00:15:02,212
Neon. Somethin' flashy.
You know what I mean?

140
00:15:02,246 --> 00:15:03,645
Bring some business in.

141
00:15:03,714 --> 00:15:05,306
Neon? What's a neon?

142
00:15:06,884 --> 00:15:08,784
Neon. You know...

143
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:12,053
-...them little colored tubes.
-Tubes.

144
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:15,619
Oh, it's a neon.

145
00:15:16,194 --> 00:15:18,162
Yeah, neon....

146
00:15:21,132 --> 00:15:22,394
Maybe.

147
00:15:23,968 --> 00:15:26,163
Goddamn, they all try cheat foreigner.

148
00:15:32,977 --> 00:15:35,002
Frank, clean up the place.

149
00:15:52,363 --> 00:15:54,763
He say how long he's gonna be gone?

150
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:57,028
He didn't tell me.

151
00:15:57,101 --> 00:16:00,298
He said he was goin' into town
to get some parts.

152
00:16:04,408 --> 00:16:07,536
Smells good in here today.

153
00:16:12,884 --> 00:16:14,818
Is that door locked?

154
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,620
I must've locked it.

155
00:16:30,935 --> 00:16:33,460
That's money down the drain,
isn't it?

156
00:16:33,938 --> 00:16:37,032
You could look at it that way,
if you wanted to, yeah.

157
00:16:40,912 --> 00:16:42,971
It's not your money, either, is it?

158
00:16:44,181 --> 00:16:45,170
No.

159
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:02,730
Open it.

160
00:17:08,773 --> 00:17:10,741
Did you hear me?

161
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:18,565
Wait a minute!

162
00:18:19,477 --> 00:18:21,570
Wait! Get off!

163
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,821
All right, come on!

164
00:18:40,498 --> 00:18:41,829
Come on!

165
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:24,327
I have surprise for you.

166
00:21:26,063 --> 00:21:27,826
Here.

167
00:21:30,501 --> 00:21:34,062
What do you think, huh? It's new.

168
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:38,098
Let's see it.

169
00:21:42,546 --> 00:21:46,346
-You like it?
-Nick, it's beautiful. Real silk?

170
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:49,886
-Yeah, silk.
-For you, huh?

171
00:21:51,155 --> 00:21:54,955
-Where you go?
-I'll be right back.

172
00:22:46,143 --> 00:22:48,703
How'd you get that way?

173
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,444
How're you feelin' tonight, Cora?

174
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:54,244
Lousy.

175
00:22:54,652 --> 00:22:55,710
Yeah.

176
00:23:08,666 --> 00:23:10,930
Yeah, you missed me.

177
00:23:12,336 --> 00:23:14,497
Cora!

178
00:24:00,451 --> 00:24:02,612
Oh, stupid, I almost forgot.

179
00:24:05,255 --> 00:24:08,486
Like the sign, huh?
I see they make it the way I say.

180
00:24:11,295 --> 00:24:12,762
See you tomorrow, eh?

181
00:24:16,767 --> 00:24:18,792
Yeah, see you later, Nick.

182
00:24:38,555 --> 00:24:39,522
Yeah?

183
00:24:53,037 --> 00:24:55,005
Feel like doin' somethin'?

184
00:24:57,408 --> 00:24:58,773
I'm doin' it.

185
00:25:13,924 --> 00:25:16,324
Do you want some company?

186
00:25:31,208 --> 00:25:33,472
Huh? Want some company?

187
00:25:43,287 --> 00:25:45,050
You want to be with me, right?

188
00:25:47,291 --> 00:25:48,383
Right?

189
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,886
Yeah.

190
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:54,022
Good.

191
00:25:55,766 --> 00:25:57,961
Go pack a bag, we're goin' to Chicago.

192
00:26:07,945 --> 00:26:10,072
Go pack a bag.

193
00:26:10,147 --> 00:26:12,274
We're goin' to Chicago. Now.

194
00:26:27,664 --> 00:26:31,156
-I used to work near here.
-Get your L.A. Times.

195
00:26:32,936 --> 00:26:35,905
-You got a cigarette?
-No.

196
00:26:38,709 --> 00:26:40,472
How much money you got?

197
00:26:40,544 --> 00:26:41,568
$110.

198
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:45,139
Don't flash it around here. Come on.

199
00:26:49,153 --> 00:26:51,587
Wait a minute. You left your suitcase.

200
00:26:51,622 --> 00:26:54,648
Bus leaving for Los Angeles,
San Diego, Phoenix....

201
00:26:57,161 --> 00:26:59,322
-Want something to eat?
-Sure.

202
00:26:59,663 --> 00:27:01,654
-Yeah.
-I'll be right back.

203
00:27:04,268 --> 00:27:06,133
The next departure will be...

204
00:27:06,236 --> 00:27:08,101
...Los Angeles to Chicago.

205
00:27:13,377 --> 00:27:14,867
Help you, sir?

206
00:27:24,721 --> 00:27:27,519
Change, sir. Sir! Change.

207
00:27:27,724 --> 00:27:30,318
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

208
00:27:35,465 --> 00:27:38,457
-I've got 'em all, what do you want?
-You want one?

209
00:27:51,782 --> 00:27:54,012
Okay, new shooter comin' into the game.

210
00:28:04,695 --> 00:28:06,720
All right, guys, four.

211
00:28:06,797 --> 00:28:09,823
I got it. Who wants a hard-ways four?

212
00:28:09,866 --> 00:28:12,096
-Two to one.
-Two to one on the hard ways?

213
00:28:12,169 --> 00:28:15,263
Right. You got it.
What about you? Dollar here.

214
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:18,740
Okay, roll 'em. Come on.
Don't touch this money.

215
00:28:18,942 --> 00:28:22,036
-Where does he think he's goin'?
-I don't know.

216
00:28:22,145 --> 00:28:25,672
-Hey, buddy, we ain't got all night.
-Honey, gimme some money.

217
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:27,478
Come on, we're gettin' lucky.

218
00:28:27,551 --> 00:28:30,019
These guys don't know craps
from wheat or somethin'.

219
00:28:31,888 --> 00:28:33,355
Come on!

220
00:28:34,024 --> 00:28:36,015
No, I'm not giving it to you.

221
00:28:36,426 --> 00:28:38,485
What? No, you don't understand.

222
00:28:38,562 --> 00:28:39,688
I got to cover a bet.

223
00:28:39,763 --> 00:28:42,698
-I can't talk to you about it just now.
-Frank, I can't go out there broke.

224
00:28:42,866 --> 00:28:44,197
What?

225
00:28:44,868 --> 00:28:47,428
What're you doin' out there, anyway?

226
00:28:47,504 --> 00:28:49,995
Will you, for Chrissakes,
just give me some money?

227
00:28:58,148 --> 00:29:00,446
I saved that money.

228
00:29:12,562 --> 00:29:14,427
Two for San Francisco.

229
00:29:17,801 --> 00:29:20,133
-What are you doing?
-I'm tradin' these in.

230
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:22,730
-San Francisco.
-Wait. We're going to Chicago.

231
00:29:22,806 --> 00:29:25,036
Not anymore.
You want to give me some money?

232
00:29:25,309 --> 00:29:27,470
-No.
-That's $37 change for you folks.

233
00:29:27,744 --> 00:29:29,234
-I appreciate that.
-Wait.

234
00:29:29,313 --> 00:29:31,372
You told me your friends
were in Chicago.

235
00:29:31,448 --> 00:29:34,849
Hey, I got friends in Chicago.
I got friends in Duluth.

236
00:29:36,353 --> 00:29:38,651
Now I'm gonna show you somethin'.
Sit down.

237
00:30:01,445 --> 00:30:03,037
What have I got?

238
00:30:09,252 --> 00:30:11,117
-You got it.
-All right.

239
00:30:13,323 --> 00:30:15,291
Oh, I must've skipped you.

240
00:30:15,525 --> 00:30:17,789
-You destroyed me.
-I sure did get lucky.

241
00:30:17,861 --> 00:30:20,193
Wait a minute.
Are you leavin' with the money?

242
00:30:21,031 --> 00:30:22,623
Well, I won it.

243
00:30:22,699 --> 00:30:24,894
Hey, mate.
I want a shot to get it back.

244
00:30:25,936 --> 00:30:29,030
Fuck you, Commodore.
I won this money.

245
00:30:31,308 --> 00:30:32,707
All right?

246
00:30:36,613 --> 00:30:38,547
It's all right with me, pal.

247
00:30:40,817 --> 00:30:43,809
-Good meetin' with ya.
-Come on, Jim.

248
00:30:45,055 --> 00:30:47,250
Wait a minute. Let's play.

249
00:30:54,898 --> 00:30:58,299
Did you see that good-looking girl
that I was talking to leave here?

250
00:30:59,336 --> 00:31:01,065
No, I don't know where she went.

251
00:31:29,499 --> 00:31:30,864
Okay, you can turn 'em on.

252
00:31:30,934 --> 00:31:33,425
I told you we shouldn'a hooked this
up in the rain in the first place.

253
00:31:33,503 --> 00:31:34,868
Finish up, already.

254
00:31:34,938 --> 00:31:36,963
-You check the connections?
-Yes, I checked the connections.

255
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,871
-Did you check the switch?
-I checked the switch.

256
00:31:38,942 --> 00:31:40,375
Well, go check the hookup.

257
00:31:40,444 --> 00:31:43,675
Your boss say, "Sign work both
day and night." I wanna lights on.

258
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:46,278
-Want a cup of coffee, Nick?
-Turn 'em on.

259
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:47,576
He's checkin' the hookup.

260
00:31:47,651 --> 00:31:50,620
Well, hurry up.
I wanna see lights on.

261
00:31:50,987 --> 00:31:52,284
Turn on.

262
00:31:53,023 --> 00:31:54,957
Where the hell is it, anyhow?

263
00:31:55,192 --> 00:31:58,355
Go around there,
he said it's around to the left.

264
00:32:00,197 --> 00:32:02,859
Yeah, I think I've found it.

265
00:32:29,693 --> 00:32:32,389
He would have found us anyway.

266
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:35,425
You don't know him, Frank.

267
00:32:35,499 --> 00:32:38,093
He would've followed us,
and he would have found us.

268
00:32:38,702 --> 00:32:40,932
Don't lose sleep over it, Cora.
I'm just disappointed.

269
00:32:41,004 --> 00:32:42,995
I thought we had somethin'.

270
00:32:45,275 --> 00:32:47,368
You just don't know what it's like.

271
00:32:48,245 --> 00:32:50,543
Bein' a woman,
trapped in this kind of....

272
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:56,550
You don't, you don't know.

273
00:32:59,256 --> 00:33:01,224
There's always a way, Cora.

274
00:33:02,993 --> 00:33:04,824
If we stick together.

275
00:33:17,574 --> 00:33:19,371
I didn't know what to do.

276
00:33:19,509 --> 00:33:20,498
Cora!

277
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:29,841
I've got to have you, Frank.

278
00:33:31,221 --> 00:33:33,712
If it was just us....

279
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:38,787
If it was just you and me.

280
00:33:40,463 --> 00:33:43,091
What are you talking about?

281
00:33:45,001 --> 00:33:48,061
I'm getting tired
of what's right and wrong.

282
00:33:51,541 --> 00:33:54,408
They hang people for that, Cora.

283
00:33:55,145 --> 00:33:56,976
Cora!

284
00:34:12,796 --> 00:34:14,058
Come here!

285
00:34:38,855 --> 00:34:41,551
Hey, Frank, it look good
from here, uh?

286
00:34:41,758 --> 00:34:44,625
Yeah. It's a hell of an idea you had.

287
00:34:45,996 --> 00:34:48,430
Hey, neon, huh? Neon.

288
00:36:08,178 --> 00:36:10,305
All right?

289
00:36:12,982 --> 00:36:15,883
Ah, ring twice for danger.
And the door?

290
00:36:18,722 --> 00:36:21,088
Locked from the inside.

291
00:36:21,224 --> 00:36:23,283
And then down the ladder
and that's it.

292
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:25,122
-Yeah.
-Okay.

293
00:36:32,402 --> 00:36:34,529
Do you love me, Frank?

294
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,502
Sure.

295
00:36:42,779 --> 00:36:44,576
You know I do.

296
00:36:51,955 --> 00:36:54,822
Don't worry about anything, okay?

297
00:36:56,993 --> 00:36:59,291
Don't tell me that.

298
00:40:38,014 --> 00:40:39,447
Evening.

299
00:40:39,816 --> 00:40:41,943
You knew I had to stop here, didn't ya?

300
00:40:44,954 --> 00:40:47,422
She's beautiful.

301
00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:49,924
I come by here all the time.
When'd you put her up?

302
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,954
-Just today.
-Had to be.

303
00:40:55,531 --> 00:40:57,726
What was that?

304
00:40:59,435 --> 00:41:02,336
-There's a damn cat up there.
-Oh, yeah.

305
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:11,043
Hey, they sound a lot like
babies cryin' sometimes, don't they?

306
00:41:11,948 --> 00:41:14,143
Yes, they do.

307
00:41:20,223 --> 00:41:22,691
Well, I expect I ought to
get back to work.

308
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,490
Yeah, well, we all got to sometime,
that's for sure.

309
00:41:26,562 --> 00:41:28,826
That's for sure. Take care now.

310
00:41:28,931 --> 00:41:31,229
Yeah, I'll do that.

311
00:41:47,583 --> 00:41:49,448
Frank, get over here!

312
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,249
Oh, my God!

313
00:41:55,691 --> 00:41:57,556
What happened to the light?

314
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:02,463
I hit him! I hit him!

315
00:42:04,667 --> 00:42:07,830
-What happened?
-I hit him and all the lights went out!

316
00:42:08,571 --> 00:42:11,233
Get on the phone. Call an ambulance.
The cop came by and saw everything.

317
00:42:11,307 --> 00:42:14,208
-The cop? What cop?
-Get on the phone!

318
00:42:15,611 --> 00:42:17,545
We're gonna die for this!

319
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:29,217
Hello, Nick.

320
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,086
Nick, wake up.

321
00:42:44,707 --> 00:42:47,676
Come on, Nick. Come on, Nick.

322
00:42:52,215 --> 00:42:53,705
Nick, wake up.

323
00:42:56,285 --> 00:42:58,549
We'll know for sure
after we see the tests.

324
00:42:58,621 --> 00:43:01,215
It'll be about a week.
All of a week.

325
00:43:08,064 --> 00:43:10,692
Can I have the book, please?

326
00:43:16,772 --> 00:43:17,761
Thanks.

327
00:43:25,515 --> 00:43:27,915
All he knows, it went dark.

328
00:43:32,221 --> 00:43:35,315
If he'd have turned around, Frank,
they'd have hanged us for it.

329
00:43:44,033 --> 00:43:47,662
And something,
something put that cop there.

330
00:43:50,907 --> 00:43:53,774
It's an act of God,
those lights went out.

331
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:00,604
Don't look back.

332
00:44:00,683 --> 00:44:03,413
-What?
-Don't look back. It's a cop.

333
00:44:05,321 --> 00:44:08,154
-His red light's on.
-Oh, God.

334
00:44:09,392 --> 00:44:11,860
No, no, leave 'em on.

335
00:44:15,064 --> 00:44:16,827
Bathroom upstairs?

336
00:44:17,733 --> 00:44:18,927
Ah, yeah.

337
00:44:22,071 --> 00:44:24,767
What's the ladder doin' there?

338
00:44:26,175 --> 00:44:28,336
I don't know.

339
00:44:29,845 --> 00:44:31,369
Hey, come here.

340
00:44:32,782 --> 00:44:34,181
All right. Sure.

341
00:44:52,735 --> 00:44:53,702
Hey.

342
00:44:57,473 --> 00:44:59,873
Cover's off this fuse box up here.

343
00:45:00,409 --> 00:45:03,674
I'd say that sucker stuck a paw in it.
Fried him deader than hell.

344
00:45:03,946 --> 00:45:05,914
Yeah. How about that?

345
00:45:06,249 --> 00:45:09,582
Must've been those guys
that were workin' on the sign today.

346
00:45:10,519 --> 00:45:11,417
Yeah.

347
00:45:13,489 --> 00:45:14,979
Sounds like that.

348
00:45:21,097 --> 00:45:23,224
Sorry about your husband, ma'am.

349
00:45:23,799 --> 00:45:24,959
Thank you.

350
00:45:28,004 --> 00:45:30,165
Thanks a lot.

351
00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:43,475
I'll get a flashlight.

352
00:46:38,007 --> 00:46:41,101
I know it's tough...to go down
and see him.

353
00:46:49,952 --> 00:46:52,944
You're sure you don't want
me to drive?

354
00:46:59,695 --> 00:47:01,287
Hurry back.

355
00:47:59,822 --> 00:48:02,791
Take it easy guys, there's plenty here.

356
00:48:08,097 --> 00:48:10,657
Cut pie. Little portions.

357
00:49:06,388 --> 00:49:08,652
John Philip Sousa.

358
00:49:40,923 --> 00:49:43,915
I don't want to make love tonight.

359
00:49:58,807 --> 00:50:00,536
It's our last night.

360
00:50:01,277 --> 00:50:02,505
I know.

361
00:50:04,046 --> 00:50:06,674
I don't want to make love.

362
00:50:15,858 --> 00:50:18,190
Yeah, you're right.

363
00:50:20,262 --> 00:50:22,423
Me neither.

364
00:50:42,751 --> 00:50:45,151
Oh, Christ, Cora.

365
00:51:39,708 --> 00:51:41,972
It's all in the feet.
You must watch the feet.

366
00:51:43,445 --> 00:51:46,278
-Can I talk to you a minute?
-It is beautiful, believe me.

367
00:51:46,315 --> 00:51:48,943
-You just watch your feet....
-Can I talk to you for a minute?

368
00:51:49,151 --> 00:51:51,312
-And you will learn....
-Excuse me.

369
00:51:58,327 --> 00:52:00,090
I can't talk about it now.

370
00:52:00,195 --> 00:52:02,561
What do you mean,
you can't talk about it now?

371
00:52:02,598 --> 00:52:05,089
Four days already,
you can't talk about it.

372
00:52:07,536 --> 00:52:10,266
Yeah, and you don't understand.

373
00:52:11,674 --> 00:52:14,472
I can't do it anymore, Frank.
You understand?

374
00:52:14,677 --> 00:52:16,076
Why can't you do it anymore?

375
00:52:16,145 --> 00:52:19,171
What does that mean?
You can't do it anymore?

376
00:52:38,634 --> 00:52:41,102
-It's over.
-Come dance.

377
00:52:41,170 --> 00:52:44,537
What? What are you talkin' about?

378
00:53:34,656 --> 00:53:36,248
Bravo, Nicko.

379
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:13,621
Come here.

380
00:54:21,470 --> 00:54:22,664
Come here.

381
00:54:32,514 --> 00:54:35,449
This man saved my life.
I'm fond this man.

382
00:54:56,705 --> 00:54:59,299
Cora, my feets, you know.

383
00:55:05,681 --> 00:55:08,479
My feets. They're beautiful, huh?

384
00:55:10,152 --> 00:55:12,416
-Beautiful.
-You say it.

385
00:55:12,688 --> 00:55:14,417
You say it Greek.

386
00:55:17,192 --> 00:55:19,285
Nick, I can't say it in Greek.

387
00:55:25,868 --> 00:55:27,699
Come on, you say it.

388
00:55:35,377 --> 00:55:36,674
Say it.

389
00:55:43,719 --> 00:55:45,209
That's it.

390
00:56:04,406 --> 00:56:07,398
Come here. Now, you say it.
Is beautiful.

391
00:56:11,413 --> 00:56:12,903
Tonight.

392
00:56:13,415 --> 00:56:14,905
What?

393
00:56:17,753 --> 00:56:19,084
What?

394
00:56:55,357 --> 00:56:57,018
What're you doing?

395
00:56:58,093 --> 00:56:59,583
You're the guy's wife, Cora.

396
00:56:59,661 --> 00:57:01,925
You told me that.

397
00:57:03,865 --> 00:57:06,265
You were gonna leave me?

398
00:57:08,937 --> 00:57:12,100
-I was writing you a note.
-Were you writing me a thank-you note?

399
00:57:14,376 --> 00:57:17,243
-Is that what you were doing?
-Cora, look.

400
00:57:17,713 --> 00:57:18,805
Live here.

401
00:57:19,047 --> 00:57:21,311
Live with the guy.

402
00:57:22,250 --> 00:57:24,275
Took a chance, we didn't make it.

403
00:57:24,519 --> 00:57:26,248
Live with the man.

404
00:57:27,689 --> 00:57:30,487
He wants to have a baby.
You understand?

405
00:57:32,995 --> 00:57:34,462
He's changed.

406
00:57:34,997 --> 00:57:38,455
He says the accident changed him
and now I'm supposed to have his kid.

407
00:57:44,139 --> 00:57:46,835
How am I gonna do that, Frank?

408
00:57:57,853 --> 00:58:00,651
How am I supposed to have his baby?

409
00:58:01,423 --> 00:58:03,857
I can't have his baby.

410
00:58:05,727 --> 00:58:08,594
The only one I could have
a baby by is you.

411
00:58:13,468 --> 00:58:14,696
Okay.

412
00:58:23,278 --> 00:58:26,042
Say you won't leave me. Please.

413
00:58:27,449 --> 00:58:29,440
Just stall him, babe.

414
00:58:30,619 --> 00:58:32,314
Just stall him.

415
00:58:50,872 --> 00:58:53,898
-Going far?
-We're goin' to Ventura.

416
00:58:54,509 --> 00:58:56,909
A trip. A change of scene.

417
00:58:58,814 --> 00:59:02,341
-Is it much farther?
-It's a couple of hours.

418
00:59:04,619 --> 00:59:07,986
-That's it.
-What do I owe ya?

419
00:59:08,390 --> 00:59:11,120
$1.44.

420
00:59:13,495 --> 00:59:16,726
-Okay. Here you go.
-Be right back.

421
00:59:33,115 --> 00:59:36,084
-Here's your change.
-I'm gonna drive now.

422
00:59:38,620 --> 00:59:41,282
You can't even walk.
What are you talkin' about, drivin'?

423
00:59:41,556 --> 00:59:43,490
-Now, get in the back.
-What?

424
00:59:43,558 --> 00:59:45,890
-Get in the back.
-Are you nuts? Are you nutty?

425
00:59:45,961 --> 00:59:47,929
-Mister, you don't want to--
-I'm drivin' this car home.

426
00:59:47,996 --> 00:59:49,725
-Come on, Frank.
-You don't want to drive tonight.

427
00:59:49,798 --> 00:59:53,564
-You don't want to drive tonight.
-What, do you own this car, big fella?

428
00:59:54,636 --> 00:59:56,968
-Get in the back.
-Just get in the back.

429
01:00:07,716 --> 01:00:09,479
That's it.

430
01:00:09,818 --> 01:00:11,979
You drive safely now, okay?
Goodnight.

431
01:00:24,933 --> 01:00:26,992
-Good wine.
-C'mon, Nick.

432
01:00:31,606 --> 01:00:33,631
Is nothing like to have a wife.

433
01:00:41,082 --> 01:00:44,643
-Cut it out, Nick.
-Don't worry. He's drunk.

434
01:00:57,499 --> 01:01:00,730
-Shit!
-Don't talk like that.

435
01:01:01,436 --> 01:01:04,405
It's boiling over, Nick.
I gotta pull over.

436
01:01:22,224 --> 01:01:24,317
Hey, wake 'im up.

437
01:01:41,943 --> 01:01:44,411
Wake up. The car's stopped.

438
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:48,114
Come on, wake up.
You gotta fix it.

439
01:01:50,452 --> 01:01:52,579
Frank, get out of the car.

440
01:02:06,368 --> 01:02:07,733
Shit.

441
01:02:08,770 --> 01:02:10,465
I'll fix it myself.

442
01:02:14,509 --> 01:02:17,137
What's a matter...with door?

443
01:02:22,017 --> 01:02:23,609
There, got it....

444
01:02:32,294 --> 01:02:34,262
Is he dead?

445
01:02:44,139 --> 01:02:45,128
Get in!

446
01:02:47,709 --> 01:02:50,075
Come on, Cora, get in.

447
01:02:58,687 --> 01:03:00,120
Drive.

448
01:03:15,136 --> 01:03:17,502
Put it in neutral.

449
01:03:30,151 --> 01:03:31,140
Wait.

450
01:04:48,930 --> 01:04:50,921
Now, Cora, come on.

451
01:04:56,304 --> 01:04:58,431
Do it...do it.

452
01:05:00,942 --> 01:05:03,103
Come on, Cora. Do it!

453
01:05:13,955 --> 01:05:15,445
Hurt me.

454
01:05:28,536 --> 01:05:31,164
Now, you got this on the dash.

455
01:05:31,940 --> 01:05:34,704
And you don't know where you got this.

456
01:08:04,158 --> 01:08:06,558
Oh, God! No!

457
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:20,600
Stop!

458
01:08:25,146 --> 01:08:29,344
There's been an accident!
Please help me! Oh, God!

459
01:08:32,353 --> 01:08:33,650
Thank you.

460
01:08:45,266 --> 01:08:47,564
How are you today?

461
01:08:49,303 --> 01:08:50,270
Fine.

462
01:08:52,140 --> 01:08:55,041
Have you ever been in San Francisco?

463
01:08:55,410 --> 01:08:56,502
Yeah.

464
01:08:56,577 --> 01:08:57,669
In Buffalo?

465
01:09:00,014 --> 01:09:01,413
Who are you, mister?

466
01:09:01,482 --> 01:09:02,881
You know who I am.

467
01:09:03,751 --> 01:09:05,651
You did time in Buffalo.

468
01:09:07,321 --> 01:09:10,347
In Wichita, armed robbery,
reduced to attempted assault.

469
01:09:10,425 --> 01:09:12,757
-Could we talk about this another day?
-St. Louis you held up a card game.

470
01:09:12,827 --> 01:09:14,920
Moline, Illinois, 13 months.

471
01:09:15,363 --> 01:09:17,695
Assault on a railroad investigator.

472
01:09:17,765 --> 01:09:19,130
They gave me something.

473
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:21,430
If you plead innocent and
make me try you for homicide...

474
01:09:21,502 --> 01:09:23,299
...l'm going to see that you pay.

475
01:09:23,371 --> 01:09:25,202
What're you sayin'?

476
01:09:25,540 --> 01:09:27,872
This have something
to do with this accident?

477
01:09:29,110 --> 01:09:31,476
-I wasn't even driving.
-Oh, you weren't even driving.

478
01:09:31,546 --> 01:09:34,310
You were too drunk to drive.
You were too drunk to walk.

479
01:09:34,549 --> 01:09:36,881
You have a witness
at the filling station, yes.

480
01:09:37,318 --> 01:09:39,115
Who do you think you're dealing with?

481
01:09:39,187 --> 01:09:41,621
-I know you killed him.
-Come on.

482
01:09:42,757 --> 01:09:44,520
Why would I want to kill him?

483
01:09:44,592 --> 01:09:46,287
Oh, buddy, I saw her.

484
01:09:46,527 --> 01:09:48,154
I might kill for her.

485
01:09:48,563 --> 01:09:50,428
Why would I want to kill for that?

486
01:09:50,798 --> 01:09:53,460
Forget the girl.
They'll hang you for the money.

487
01:09:57,171 --> 01:09:58,866
What money?

488
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:01,299
A $10,000 life insurance policy.

489
01:10:01,375 --> 01:10:04,208
Issued on Nick Papadakis
by Pacific Reliance...

490
01:10:04,245 --> 01:10:06,338
...his wife, the sole beneficiary.

491
01:10:06,614 --> 01:10:08,809
Does that look familiar, Frank?

492
01:10:11,219 --> 01:10:13,312
Don't play around with
the insurance company.

493
01:10:13,387 --> 01:10:15,252
They don't like to lose.

494
01:10:16,591 --> 01:10:20,049
Mister, I swear I don't know nothin'
about no insurance policy.

495
01:10:20,261 --> 01:10:21,853
Oh, come on, Frank.

496
01:10:21,929 --> 01:10:25,023
Either she did it, or you did
it together. Now, which is it?

497
01:10:25,133 --> 01:10:26,122
I didn't kill him.

498
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:28,031
Prove it to me, Frank.

499
01:10:28,069 --> 01:10:29,366
How can I prove it to you?

500
01:10:29,437 --> 01:10:30,631
Sign this.

501
01:10:34,041 --> 01:10:35,167
What is this?

502
01:10:35,243 --> 01:10:38,770
It's the only thing that'll convince me
and the jury of your innocence.

503
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:41,141
All right, Frank?

504
01:10:41,716 --> 01:10:43,513
Let's get out of here.

505
01:11:05,373 --> 01:11:06,567
It's all right.

506
01:11:20,788 --> 01:11:22,221
My name is Katz.

507
01:11:23,124 --> 01:11:25,285
I'm representing you and Mrs. Papadakis.

508
01:11:26,594 --> 01:11:28,687
The two of you are going
to be arraigned tomorrow.

509
01:11:28,763 --> 01:11:31,561
Until then, anybody ask you anything...

510
01:11:31,732 --> 01:11:33,461
...you say, "Talk to the lawyer."

511
01:11:33,534 --> 01:11:36,503
Do you understand that, Frank?

512
01:11:36,537 --> 01:11:37,629
Yeah.

513
01:11:37,872 --> 01:11:38,839
Good.

514
01:11:46,147 --> 01:11:47,808
Did you sign this?

515
01:11:52,253 --> 01:11:55,950
Don't sign anything else, huh?

516
01:11:58,226 --> 01:12:00,387
You got yourself pretty banged up.

517
01:12:00,461 --> 01:12:03,123
Good. It'll look good in court.

518
01:12:04,665 --> 01:12:07,156
Hey, are you gonna see Cora?

519
01:12:09,036 --> 01:12:10,367
Yeah.

520
01:12:12,540 --> 01:12:14,531
Tell her I didn't mean it.

521
01:12:32,059 --> 01:12:33,822
It was broken in the act.

522
01:12:33,895 --> 01:12:36,159
'Cause it was used
to strike the victim on the head...

523
01:12:36,230 --> 01:12:37,993
...which caused his death.

524
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:40,867
In your opinion could the victim's
injuries have been caused by...

525
01:12:40,935 --> 01:12:42,493
...an overturning car?

526
01:12:42,570 --> 01:12:43,264
No.

527
01:12:43,337 --> 01:12:46,170
I object, Your Honor.
This man is not a doctor.

528
01:12:46,240 --> 01:12:50,973
This man is an acknowledged expert
in the field of insurance fraud.

529
01:12:51,045 --> 01:12:52,376
This man is an interested party.

530
01:12:52,446 --> 01:12:55,381
If my clients were to be convicted,
his company, Pacific Reliance...

531
01:12:55,416 --> 01:12:57,976
...stands to save $10,000.

532
01:12:58,252 --> 01:13:00,413
Your Honor, I strenuously object
and request that...

533
01:13:00,488 --> 01:13:01,955
...his entire testimony be stricken.

534
01:13:02,023 --> 01:13:03,149
Overruled.

535
01:13:04,825 --> 01:13:06,759
Thank you, I'm finished.

536
01:13:09,830 --> 01:13:12,822
Now, Your Honor, at this time
I will submit a complaint and...

537
01:13:12,867 --> 01:13:15,358
...request for damages sworn
by Frank Chambers against...

538
01:13:15,403 --> 01:13:18,201
-...Mrs. Cora Papadakis...
-What?

539
01:13:18,572 --> 01:13:21,803
...for injuries sustained
in a car under her control.

540
01:13:21,909 --> 01:13:23,900
-I object to this complaint.
-What complaint?

541
01:13:23,978 --> 01:13:25,240
Under the California Vehicle Act....

542
01:13:25,313 --> 01:13:27,110
Did you sign something, Frank?

543
01:13:28,182 --> 01:13:30,412
Did you sign something against me?

544
01:13:30,484 --> 01:13:31,644
Sit down, Cora.

545
01:13:31,719 --> 01:13:34,882
You wouldn't do that to me, would you?
He wouldn't do that to me.

546
01:13:36,590 --> 01:13:40,082
-Your Honor, that is exactly....
-What did he sign?! What complaint?!

547
01:13:40,394 --> 01:13:42,123
This supposed complaint...

548
01:13:42,196 --> 01:13:43,527
...acts on the adjudication
of the matter...

549
01:13:43,597 --> 01:13:45,588
-Show it to me!
-...can have no bearing.

550
01:13:46,167 --> 01:13:48,226
I want to see it! I don't believe it!
Show it to me!

551
01:13:48,302 --> 01:13:49,326
Overruled.

552
01:13:49,904 --> 01:13:52,464
-Enter the complaint.
-I don't believe he says I did it.

553
01:13:52,506 --> 01:13:55,202
You cannot enter the complaint.
It was extorted from a man...

554
01:13:55,409 --> 01:13:58,003
...a seriously injured man
under the influence of drugs...

555
01:13:58,145 --> 01:14:00,443
...and extraordinary pain
without the benefit of counsel....

556
01:14:00,514 --> 01:14:01,503
I've ruled on it.

557
01:14:01,582 --> 01:14:02,947
Will you proceed?

558
01:14:29,710 --> 01:14:32,838
Under the circumstances of this ruling,
I have no alternative but...

559
01:14:32,913 --> 01:14:35,473
...to withdraw my plea of "Not guilty"
and to plead Mrs. Papadakis...

560
01:14:35,549 --> 01:14:36,811
..."Guilty as charged."

561
01:14:36,884 --> 01:14:38,146
State accepts the plea.

562
01:14:38,219 --> 01:14:39,846
Your Honor, I move to adjourn.

563
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:41,012
Accepted.

564
01:14:44,258 --> 01:14:45,657
Wait!

565
01:14:48,562 --> 01:14:50,427
You're workin' for the state.

566
01:15:11,285 --> 01:15:14,345
He changed her plea to "Guilty."

567
01:15:19,660 --> 01:15:22,891
-You're making a terrible mistake.
-Just shut up.

568
01:15:33,874 --> 01:15:35,865
Okay, ready?

569
01:15:44,752 --> 01:15:46,583
Okay, this is my statement.

570
01:15:49,623 --> 01:15:52,091
We did it all.

571
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:57,922
Frank Chambers and I planned it
and killed my husband.

572
01:16:47,047 --> 01:16:49,538
-I'll just be a few minutes.
-Fine.

573
01:17:00,094 --> 01:17:03,461
-I appreciate you seeing me.
-Okay, what is it? They're guilty.

574
01:17:03,564 --> 01:17:05,498
That's yet to be decided.

575
01:17:05,566 --> 01:17:06,999
They're guilty.
What you want me to do?

576
01:17:07,067 --> 01:17:09,592
I can turn around and plead
them innocent. I've got 48 hours.

577
01:17:10,471 --> 01:17:13,372
Look, they've tried to kill him
once before.

578
01:17:13,674 --> 01:17:16,370
Oh, that's very interesting
you should think that.

579
01:17:17,011 --> 01:17:18,103
On March 5th, there was a party.

580
01:17:18,179 --> 01:17:20,306
I've got a fucking Greek army's
gonna tromp in here and...

581
01:17:20,381 --> 01:17:22,849
...swear that Papadakis threw his arms
around Chambers and said:

582
01:17:23,050 --> 01:17:25,018
"That's the man who saved my life."

583
01:17:27,521 --> 01:17:28,886
I think you got it backwards.

584
01:17:28,956 --> 01:17:30,184
Off the record.

585
01:17:30,824 --> 01:17:31,620
Sure.

586
01:17:32,026 --> 01:17:34,586
You don't mean to sit there and
tell me you think they're innocent?

587
01:17:34,728 --> 01:17:39,028
That is precisely what I'm telling you.
And that's what I'm telling the jury.

588
01:17:39,133 --> 01:17:40,760
The prosecution's got no case.

589
01:17:40,834 --> 01:17:43,302
They've got no evidence,
no witnesses, nothing.

590
01:17:43,504 --> 01:17:45,301
All they've got is you.

591
01:17:45,372 --> 01:17:47,272
And what are you doin'?

592
01:17:47,575 --> 01:17:50,806
Don't forget.
I am talking to poor people out there.

593
01:17:51,712 --> 01:17:53,270
Now, that jury....

594
01:17:53,347 --> 01:17:54,939
They've got an attractive...

595
01:17:55,015 --> 01:17:58,075
...grief-stricken, young woman
on that stand on the one hand.

596
01:17:58,185 --> 01:17:59,345
On the other hand...

597
01:17:59,420 --> 01:18:01,149
...they've got you, pal.

598
01:18:01,288 --> 01:18:02,516
You and your...

599
01:18:02,590 --> 01:18:05,388
...big insurance company
trying to save ten grand.

600
01:18:08,162 --> 01:18:09,527
We'll see.

601
01:18:10,998 --> 01:18:13,626
What do you think?

602
01:18:14,735 --> 01:18:16,726
I still think they're gonna burn 'em.

603
01:18:17,304 --> 01:18:20,000
And if they don't...

604
01:18:20,241 --> 01:18:22,232
...you've cost your company ten grand.

605
01:18:22,977 --> 01:18:25,468
There goes your Christmas bonus.

606
01:18:25,646 --> 01:18:27,307
You wanna take that chance?

607
01:18:29,683 --> 01:18:32,846
I'm gonna show you a way
that you don't have to take a chance.

608
01:18:32,953 --> 01:18:35,012
Now what?

609
01:18:38,425 --> 01:18:40,359
Okay.

610
01:18:41,362 --> 01:18:43,887
This is Art Beeman, Claims Department,
Western Equitable.

611
01:18:44,198 --> 01:18:46,325
-Hello, Beeman.
-Glad to meet you.

612
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:48,095
Tell him.

613
01:18:48,168 --> 01:18:49,601
Well...

614
01:18:49,670 --> 01:18:53,299
...my company issued
a $25,000 liability policy...

615
01:18:53,674 --> 01:18:57,110
...home, business, auto,
to Mr. Nick Papadakis, just...

616
01:18:57,611 --> 01:18:58,839
...slightly before his death.

617
01:18:58,912 --> 01:19:02,279
Frank Chambers
was a passenger in the car.

618
01:19:02,716 --> 01:19:04,206
He sustained various lacerations...

619
01:19:04,285 --> 01:19:06,150
...a concussion,
and severe back trauma...

620
01:19:06,220 --> 01:19:08,017
...which will, I'm advised,
impair for the rest of his life...

621
01:19:08,088 --> 01:19:09,988
...his ability to walk.

622
01:19:10,057 --> 01:19:12,548
If she was trying to kill her husband,
and in the process...

623
01:19:12,660 --> 01:19:16,096
...made my man, an employee
and passenger in her car...

624
01:19:16,196 --> 01:19:17,925
...a cripple for life.

625
01:19:18,065 --> 01:19:19,089
I'll go into court.

626
01:19:19,166 --> 01:19:22,363
I'm gonna sue Western Equitable here
for 25 grand and I'm gonna win.

627
01:19:26,006 --> 01:19:30,568
-Here's what he's prepared to do.
-Would you excuse us, please?

628
01:19:30,711 --> 01:19:32,338
I would.

629
01:19:41,655 --> 01:19:44,317
Western's in an unprotected
posture here.

630
01:19:45,192 --> 01:19:47,592
You're saying you'd reimburse?

631
01:19:48,095 --> 01:19:49,187
Precisely.

632
01:19:50,064 --> 01:19:54,091
Now, if you were prepared,
we'd pay the $10,000 death benefit.

633
01:19:55,169 --> 01:19:56,796
Cleared this with your people?

634
01:19:56,870 --> 01:19:58,303
Absolutely.

635
01:19:58,472 --> 01:20:01,532
Well, I think we can do business.

636
01:20:17,958 --> 01:20:21,121
Here you go, Frank.
I already signed for 'em.

637
01:20:21,228 --> 01:20:22,627
Go ahead.

638
01:20:23,464 --> 01:20:25,056
Come on, take it.

639
01:20:28,202 --> 01:20:30,466
Come here.

640
01:20:34,908 --> 01:20:37,468
They never had a thing.
They bluffed ya.

641
01:20:37,544 --> 01:20:38,704
Sackett bluffed ya.

642
01:20:38,779 --> 01:20:40,872
Gets you to sign a complaint against
the woman, uses the complaint...

643
01:20:40,981 --> 01:20:44,815
...to get her to confess
and you both walk the plank.

644
01:20:44,952 --> 01:20:47,887
Get it?

645
01:20:47,955 --> 01:20:50,480
Come on, my boy.
You're goin' home.

646
01:20:51,058 --> 01:20:53,993
-Come on, we'll get you changed.
-You're kiddin'.

647
01:20:55,262 --> 01:20:56,889
You're kidding.

648
01:20:56,997 --> 01:20:59,329
Here you go.

649
01:21:01,168 --> 01:21:04,626
-She's free?
-That is correct.

650
01:21:04,772 --> 01:21:06,865
-But....
-But what?

651
01:21:06,974 --> 01:21:08,168
She confessed.

652
01:21:08,242 --> 01:21:11,109
Luckily, though, she confessed
to my assistant, Kennedy.

653
01:21:11,178 --> 01:21:13,908
The red-headed guy.
I bet you thought he was a cop.

654
01:21:14,114 --> 01:21:15,672
Yeah, I did.

655
01:21:15,783 --> 01:21:18,581
-Well, he wasn't. He works for me.
-Really?

656
01:21:20,354 --> 01:21:22,413
Thought it might be a good idea
for her to get it off her chest...

657
01:21:22,489 --> 01:21:23,547
...before they locked her up.

658
01:21:23,624 --> 01:21:25,489
She was very upset.

659
01:21:27,628 --> 01:21:29,858
Let's go out the back way,
avoid the press. Okay?

660
01:21:29,930 --> 01:21:32,091
Where are they goin'?
And where's the girl?

661
01:21:35,536 --> 01:21:38,937
The best part was the insurance.
Their Mr. Barlow, their expert...

662
01:21:39,239 --> 01:21:41,764
...he stands up in court,
says he made a grave mistake...

663
01:21:41,809 --> 01:21:43,868
...the whole thing
was an auto accident.

664
01:21:44,678 --> 01:21:46,669
Hell of a world, huh, Frank?

665
01:21:47,848 --> 01:21:51,375
Yeah. Where's Cora?

666
01:21:51,585 --> 01:21:53,382
Outside in a cab.
I told her to wait for Kennedy.

667
01:21:53,454 --> 01:21:56,116
I knew I'd find you here, sneaking out.

668
01:21:56,256 --> 01:21:59,054
-Yeah, that's right.
-You'd best sneak out.

669
01:21:59,293 --> 01:22:00,988
The file stays open on you.

670
01:22:01,061 --> 01:22:02,494
On you and the woman, both.

671
01:22:02,563 --> 01:22:04,190
You put yourselves above the law.
You killed.

672
01:22:04,264 --> 01:22:06,198
Hey, I'm sorry,
you can't talk to me that way.

673
01:22:06,266 --> 01:22:08,291
-I can't?
-'Cause I been inside a court of law.

674
01:22:08,368 --> 01:22:10,359
You'll be back, my friend.
I know your type.

675
01:22:10,437 --> 01:22:11,734
I'll see you again.

676
01:22:13,307 --> 01:22:15,366
Spit on the sidewalk
and you'll die in jail.

677
01:22:15,442 --> 01:22:18,002
Hey, hey. Learn to lose!

678
01:22:36,096 --> 01:22:38,087
Thanks a lot.

679
01:22:38,765 --> 01:22:40,255
That's okay.

680
01:22:40,467 --> 01:22:42,401
You took our part, eh?

681
01:22:42,536 --> 01:22:44,595
And you made me $10,000.

682
01:22:49,977 --> 01:22:51,774
It's been swell.

683
01:23:29,449 --> 01:23:33,215
I had to pay him
the insurance money, the lawyer.

684
01:23:34,555 --> 01:23:36,022
Yeah, I know.

685
01:23:36,056 --> 01:23:39,082
I didn't even know
he had an insurance policy.

686
01:23:44,431 --> 01:23:47,764
Can't leave this state for six months.
I've got to call 'em every week.

687
01:23:50,404 --> 01:23:52,804
I'm gonna have a record.

688
01:24:10,791 --> 01:24:14,227
I didn't mean to turn on ya.

689
01:25:20,227 --> 01:25:23,355
That's mine.

690
01:26:05,706 --> 01:26:08,106
-She doesn't look that old.
-Well, that's her.

691
01:26:08,208 --> 01:26:10,108
I saw her picture.

692
01:26:11,078 --> 01:26:13,444
She's acting exactly
as I expected her to.

693
01:26:13,547 --> 01:26:16,072
She'll hear you!

694
01:26:16,249 --> 01:26:18,240
Wonderful pie.

695
01:26:18,285 --> 01:26:19,217
Miss....

696
01:26:20,554 --> 01:26:21,748
Keep the change.

697
01:26:23,323 --> 01:26:25,689
Thanks. Come again.

698
01:26:25,759 --> 01:26:26,748
Sure will.

699
01:26:26,827 --> 01:26:27,953
Miss?

700
01:26:28,028 --> 01:26:29,791
How about that chicken?

701
01:26:29,896 --> 01:26:31,761
I'll have it for you in two minutes.

702
01:26:32,899 --> 01:26:35,367
You think you could get in
and help out, huh?

703
01:26:43,009 --> 01:26:45,204
-You're doin' fine.
-I'm doin' fine.

704
01:26:45,245 --> 01:26:48,009
I'd be doin' a little bit better
if you'd do some work around here.

705
01:26:49,649 --> 01:26:53,016
What're you killin' yourself for?
We're leavin' in two months.

706
01:26:53,386 --> 01:26:54,580
That's what you said.

707
01:26:54,654 --> 01:26:56,281
Soon as your probation's up...

708
01:26:56,356 --> 01:26:59,587
-...we're leavin'. Right?
-You wanna leave, Frank?

709
01:27:00,727 --> 01:27:02,991
You can go now.

710
01:27:04,131 --> 01:27:05,860
You wanna stay...

711
01:27:05,932 --> 01:27:07,923
...then do some work around here.

712
01:27:12,305 --> 01:27:15,570
And will you use a glass?

713
01:27:15,776 --> 01:27:18,176
What are you, an animal?

714
01:27:25,018 --> 01:27:29,011
What're you gonna do
with the money?

715
01:27:31,892 --> 01:27:35,259
I'm gonna buy a new car.

716
01:27:41,635 --> 01:27:45,696
What the hell do you care
what I'm gonna do?

717
01:27:55,649 --> 01:27:56,980
Move!

718
01:27:59,219 --> 01:28:01,380
Move! Come on!

719
01:28:02,255 --> 01:28:04,519
You bastard, get out of there.

720
01:28:04,691 --> 01:28:07,854
Get out. Go on, move!

721
01:29:00,080 --> 01:29:02,742
-You folks need somethin'?
-No, thank you.

722
01:29:15,795 --> 01:29:18,355
There you go, gentlemen.

723
01:29:18,431 --> 01:29:21,093
I've been looking for you.

724
01:29:21,635 --> 01:29:23,933
Well, you found me.

725
01:29:24,004 --> 01:29:26,131
I saw your picture in the paper.

726
01:29:26,439 --> 01:29:28,703
Join the club.

727
01:29:31,745 --> 01:29:33,804
Here's a menu.
I'll be right back.

728
01:29:33,914 --> 01:29:36,815
You know, I knew you
since you were a little girl.

729
01:29:38,652 --> 01:29:41,177
I knew it was you.

730
01:29:41,254 --> 01:29:43,222
But I didn't want to call.

731
01:29:44,958 --> 01:29:48,724
I knew they'd lost track of you.

732
01:29:49,195 --> 01:29:51,891
I get The Courier still, from home.

733
01:29:56,336 --> 01:29:58,361
And I read about your mother.

734
01:29:59,506 --> 01:30:02,407
I was pretty sure you didn't know.

735
01:30:05,578 --> 01:30:08,308
Oh, you don't remember me.

736
01:30:08,949 --> 01:30:10,814
But I remember you.

737
01:30:30,603 --> 01:30:33,766
-Want me to call the probation people?
-No, don't call them.

738
01:30:33,807 --> 01:30:37,607
I'll be back next week, the latest.

739
01:30:40,680 --> 01:30:43,877
I'm sure she'll be all right.

740
01:30:43,984 --> 01:30:45,884
Let me know, huh?

741
01:30:46,786 --> 01:30:48,083
Yeah, I will.

742
01:32:06,599 --> 01:32:08,567
What is this, a holiday?

743
01:32:10,136 --> 01:32:11,296
Closed.

744
01:32:11,838 --> 01:32:13,738
Come on, gimme a break, huh?

745
01:32:13,940 --> 01:32:17,637
What'll it take you, a minute?

746
01:32:17,777 --> 01:32:19,005
Where you headin'?

747
01:32:19,579 --> 01:32:20,807
San Diego.

748
01:32:38,031 --> 01:32:41,364
What've you got in the back there,
if you don't mind my askin'?

749
01:32:43,503 --> 01:32:45,494
Cats.

750
01:33:06,593 --> 01:33:08,959
What is this?

751
01:33:09,329 --> 01:33:10,796
Three cats.

752
01:33:11,097 --> 01:33:13,327
What are they, drugged?

753
01:33:13,399 --> 01:33:15,629
No. They're tired.

754
01:33:17,403 --> 01:33:19,928
They're very tired.

755
01:33:20,039 --> 01:33:23,805
These cats are drugged.
No. I tell you they will not perform.

756
01:33:23,877 --> 01:33:26,903
I will not get in the ring with them.
Take them out of here.

757
01:33:26,946 --> 01:33:29,107
All right. What is it you need?

758
01:33:29,315 --> 01:33:32,011
I told you. I need performers.

759
01:33:32,218 --> 01:33:34,914
-I need wild animals.
-And where do you get them?

760
01:33:35,054 --> 01:33:36,487
Gutierrez.

761
01:33:36,556 --> 01:33:39,081
-Where are they?
-Mexico.

762
01:33:39,893 --> 01:33:44,159
All right, you get the cats.
Join back up in Tucson on the 12th.

763
01:33:44,230 --> 01:33:45,026
You do it.

764
01:33:45,098 --> 01:33:46,565
-Good?
-Yeah.

765
01:33:47,333 --> 01:33:49,528
Anything else you need?

766
01:33:49,602 --> 01:33:52,002
Of course. A driver.

767
01:33:53,740 --> 01:33:55,264
Excuse me.

768
01:33:56,009 --> 01:33:57,135
Put your....

769
01:33:57,210 --> 01:33:59,201
Take the cats away. I'm sorry.

770
01:33:59,779 --> 01:34:02,577
You're right about that,
you know, miss.

771
01:34:02,649 --> 01:34:03,775
What's that?

772
01:34:03,850 --> 01:34:08,082
I drove a hundred miles with these
cats and...they didn't peep once.

773
01:34:08,188 --> 01:34:09,553
Is that so?

774
01:34:11,157 --> 01:34:14,024
Here's a fine little animal.

775
01:34:14,093 --> 01:34:15,856
What about that?

776
01:34:17,197 --> 01:34:19,893
And, who, might I ask, are you?

777
01:34:21,601 --> 01:34:23,159
Frank Chambers, miss.

778
01:34:24,504 --> 01:34:26,836
Pleased to meet you, Frank.

779
01:34:36,983 --> 01:34:40,680
You know what I'd do for you?

780
01:34:41,454 --> 01:34:43,820
Buy you a hat.

781
01:34:44,390 --> 01:34:46,324
Yeah, a big white one.

782
01:34:47,060 --> 01:34:49,392
-You'd like that, huh?
-Sure.

783
01:36:08,141 --> 01:36:11,076
I'm sorry about your mother, Cora.

784
01:36:11,144 --> 01:36:12,805
She was old.

785
01:36:15,748 --> 01:36:17,579
Let's get a drink.

786
01:36:17,650 --> 01:36:20,619
No, I quit it.
I'm not drinkin' anymore.

787
01:36:23,289 --> 01:36:27,316
I've been thinkin' about
a lot of things, Frank.

788
01:36:28,061 --> 01:36:30,029
Let's just go home.

789
01:36:53,720 --> 01:36:57,315
I'm going to have a baby.

790
01:37:01,027 --> 01:37:04,793
I'm going to have your baby, Frank.

791
01:37:07,133 --> 01:37:08,862
Do you want it?

792
01:37:12,171 --> 01:37:15,538
Yeah, I do.

793
01:37:19,345 --> 01:37:21,836
-Tell me you want it.
-I do.

794
01:37:21,881 --> 01:37:24,372
-You do?
-I do want it.

795
01:37:25,485 --> 01:37:27,783
-You do?
-Sure.

796
01:37:32,091 --> 01:37:34,389
Jeez!

797
01:37:34,927 --> 01:37:37,725
You're gonna have a baby, huh?

798
01:37:38,331 --> 01:37:40,925
Think about that, huh?

799
01:37:58,017 --> 01:38:00,747
We lost some business, Cora.

800
01:38:01,554 --> 01:38:03,818
I don't care.

801
01:38:06,993 --> 01:38:09,518
I closed the place for a week.

802
01:38:09,662 --> 01:38:13,257
Went to San Francisco.

803
01:38:13,966 --> 01:38:16,833
I don't care.

804
01:38:23,576 --> 01:38:26,670
I've been wrong, haven't l?

805
01:38:26,813 --> 01:38:27,802
No.

806
01:38:30,550 --> 01:38:34,077
Yes, I have. I know I have.

807
01:38:40,793 --> 01:38:44,627
I've been makin' our life hell here.

808
01:38:52,104 --> 01:38:54,095
But I'm gonna change now, Frank.

809
01:38:58,744 --> 01:38:59,836
'Cause...

810
01:39:01,147 --> 01:39:02,808
...if we got each other...

811
01:39:05,485 --> 01:39:08,147
...then, we got everything.

812
01:39:12,625 --> 01:39:16,686
I want you to forgive me, please.
Oh, God!

813
01:39:17,296 --> 01:39:20,459
Hey.

814
01:39:21,534 --> 01:39:22,523
Come on.

815
01:39:28,441 --> 01:39:31,569
So you want to know what I learned?
About babies?

816
01:39:34,714 --> 01:39:37,615
What the most important thing is?

817
01:39:40,520 --> 01:39:43,455
You always got to be natural with them.

818
01:39:45,992 --> 01:39:49,450
I'm always natural.

819
01:39:49,996 --> 01:39:54,023
'Cause they can tell, you know?
Young as they are, they know.

820
01:39:54,100 --> 01:39:57,467
-Yeah, but--
-So what you gotta do is two things.

821
01:39:57,837 --> 01:39:59,566
First one....

822
01:40:00,373 --> 01:40:02,739
First one is, you gotta
follow your instincts.

823
01:40:04,644 --> 01:40:05,941
What is it?

824
01:40:07,013 --> 01:40:08,810
The second thing....

825
01:40:10,249 --> 01:40:12,774
Tell 'em to go away.

826
01:40:13,586 --> 01:40:15,178
Yeah. I'll get rid of 'em.

827
01:40:21,594 --> 01:40:24,927
-Closed.
-Can I bother you for a minute?

828
01:40:25,031 --> 01:40:27,363
-We're closed.
-I know. It won't take but a minute.

829
01:40:27,466 --> 01:40:28,558
Please.

830
01:40:29,335 --> 01:40:31,200
Just a minute.

831
01:40:40,780 --> 01:40:43,180
Mr. Kennedy. Remember me?

832
01:40:43,849 --> 01:40:44,941
Yeah, sure.

833
01:40:45,518 --> 01:40:47,509
-How's Mr. Katz?
-Yeah, right.

834
01:40:49,855 --> 01:40:51,948
I don't, I don't work
for him anymore.

835
01:40:52,391 --> 01:40:53,949
-Is that right?
-Yeah.

836
01:40:56,495 --> 01:40:58,326
What're you doin' now?

837
01:40:59,932 --> 01:41:02,924
As a matter of fact,
I'm not doin' anything.

838
01:41:03,636 --> 01:41:06,537
That's...that's why
I thought I'd drop by.

839
01:41:07,573 --> 01:41:11,407
You know, I thought maybe
you could help me out.

840
01:41:11,477 --> 01:41:13,741
Oh, yeah? ln what way?

841
01:41:14,246 --> 01:41:17,147
What do you need,
a couple of bucks or somethin'?

842
01:41:17,316 --> 01:41:20,114
I mean, I know you're out of a job.

843
01:41:22,388 --> 01:41:26,688
You remember that confession
that I typed up that time?

844
01:41:28,694 --> 01:41:29,956
Oh, yeah.

845
01:41:30,029 --> 01:41:32,224
You mean that phoney thing
you and Katz dreamed up?

846
01:41:32,365 --> 01:41:33,992
Yeah, right.

847
01:41:34,133 --> 01:41:36,829
Yeah, well, you know,
when I left Katz...

848
01:41:40,106 --> 01:41:44,338
...l took the liberty of taking it
with me from his files.

849
01:41:47,246 --> 01:41:50,113
I thought the two of you might like it.

850
01:41:55,287 --> 01:41:57,414
Nice place here.

851
01:42:00,126 --> 01:42:02,788
You want $100?

852
01:42:04,864 --> 01:42:08,300
I want ten grand.

853
01:42:09,201 --> 01:42:12,193
Ten grand?
What are you crazy, Bozo?

854
01:42:12,405 --> 01:42:14,669
What are you, insane?
We gave the money to Katz.

855
01:42:14,774 --> 01:42:16,537
Who cares? I just want the money.

856
01:42:16,609 --> 01:42:18,668
Get it for me.

857
01:42:18,911 --> 01:42:20,879
Sell the place.

858
01:42:21,113 --> 01:42:23,547
Bring me ten or I mail the confession
off to Sackett and you die.

859
01:42:23,616 --> 01:42:25,277
The End.

860
01:43:02,054 --> 01:43:04,682
Fuck with my family.

861
01:43:06,525 --> 01:43:08,652
Where's the paper?
Where's the paper?

862
01:43:08,728 --> 01:43:11,663
-I can't tell you.
-Where's the paper?

863
01:43:14,166 --> 01:43:16,259
-I got it in the bank.
-In the bank?

864
01:43:16,335 --> 01:43:18,235
-Which one?
-I can't tell you.

865
01:43:18,304 --> 01:43:20,295
Which one?

866
01:43:21,140 --> 01:43:22,971
Which one?

867
01:43:24,410 --> 01:43:25,707
Which one?

868
01:43:26,112 --> 01:43:27,841
Glendale Trust.

869
01:43:46,766 --> 01:43:48,256
Get the gun.

870
01:43:56,142 --> 01:43:58,975
-How do you feel?
-I feel great.

871
01:43:59,211 --> 01:44:01,941
I'll get back as soon as I can.
You want anything from town?

872
01:44:02,014 --> 01:44:03,982
No.

873
01:44:05,785 --> 01:44:08,276
Let's go, Kennedy.

874
01:44:12,625 --> 01:44:14,456
You folks open?

875
01:44:17,029 --> 01:44:18,087
Sure.

876
01:44:43,255 --> 01:44:45,746
There you go.

877
01:45:15,087 --> 01:45:16,611
Cora?

878
01:46:19,418 --> 01:46:21,249
Your friend came by.

879
01:46:27,693 --> 01:46:29,285
You bastard!

880
01:46:35,200 --> 01:46:38,431
Don't come near me.

881
01:46:42,041 --> 01:46:44,532
You're scum, Frank.

882
01:46:46,812 --> 01:46:49,838
I knew that when I met you.

883
01:46:49,982 --> 01:46:52,041
You'll never change.

884
01:47:00,159 --> 01:47:01,786
Your confession.

885
01:47:12,771 --> 01:47:16,605
I don't even need it.
I never did.

886
01:47:17,209 --> 01:47:21,578
They tried me for it once.
They can't touch me now.

887
01:47:23,182 --> 01:47:27,141
You understand?
It's in the Constitution.

888
01:47:29,421 --> 01:47:31,685
Didn't you know that, Frank?

889
01:47:37,096 --> 01:47:39,496
But they can try you.

890
01:47:43,802 --> 01:47:46,202
They can still try you.

891
01:48:04,957 --> 01:48:07,118
Who're you callin'?

892
01:49:39,952 --> 01:49:41,249
I'm cold.

893
01:50:04,643 --> 01:50:06,235
You sure about that?

894
01:51:04,937 --> 01:51:06,700
I want to marry ya.

895
01:51:21,386 --> 01:51:24,947
You just want to shut me up.

896
01:51:27,092 --> 01:51:29,822
If I wanted to shut you up,
I'd have shut you up.

897
01:51:34,032 --> 01:51:36,830
I want to marry ya.

898
01:51:45,410 --> 01:51:48,106
Is that what you want?

899
01:51:48,447 --> 01:51:49,471
Yeah.

900
01:51:53,752 --> 01:51:54,776
Today.

901
01:52:37,462 --> 01:52:39,453
You want to wait till the weekend?

902
01:53:07,626 --> 01:53:11,153
You know, I been thinkin'.

903
01:53:11,363 --> 01:53:14,799
Maybe we ought to sell that place, huh?

904
01:53:15,133 --> 01:53:19,035
It ain't bad, honey.
For kids...keep pets.

905
01:53:34,419 --> 01:53:36,046
Walking there?

906
01:53:36,221 --> 01:53:37,984
Why not?

907
01:53:44,996 --> 01:53:47,590
You got a beer there? Huh?

908
01:53:53,605 --> 01:53:55,971
-There you go.
-Got the opener?

909
01:53:56,141 --> 01:53:56,937
Yep.

910
01:53:59,878 --> 01:54:02,005
That's it. That's it.

911
01:54:10,288 --> 01:54:13,086
-Cora? What's wrong?
-It's okay.

912
01:54:13,158 --> 01:54:14,591
-What's wrong?
-It's okay.

913
01:54:14,659 --> 01:54:15,990
-You all right?
-Just hurt for a minute.

914
01:54:16,061 --> 01:54:18,052
-You sure?
-Yeah.

915
01:54:19,097 --> 01:54:21,065
-No, it's okay.
-No, come on. Get in.

916
01:54:21,299 --> 01:54:22,891
Take it easy.

917
01:54:25,303 --> 01:54:27,430
I'll get over this in just a minute.

918
01:54:27,739 --> 01:54:30,207
I just feel dizzy.

919
01:54:30,442 --> 01:54:32,569
We'll get somebody to look at you.

920
01:54:32,644 --> 01:54:35,636
-No, I'm fine.
-Hey, you listen to me.

921
01:54:51,797 --> 01:54:53,992
I just want to go home.
Really, Frank.

922
01:54:56,368 --> 01:54:58,768
I'm gonna have you looked at.

923
01:54:59,137 --> 01:55:01,662
I just felt a little funny.

924
01:55:01,873 --> 01:55:04,341
Like I strained something.

925
01:55:04,443 --> 01:55:06,172
That's what I mean.

926
01:55:41,279 --> 01:55:43,839
Feelin' a little better? Huh?

927
01:55:44,549 --> 01:55:45,948
Feel great.

928
01:55:46,017 --> 01:55:47,609
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

929
01:55:47,652 --> 01:55:48,778
Good.

930
01:55:48,854 --> 01:55:51,015
Yeah.

931
01:55:51,089 --> 01:55:52,579
You do?

932
01:55:52,657 --> 01:55:55,091
Why shouldn't l?

933
