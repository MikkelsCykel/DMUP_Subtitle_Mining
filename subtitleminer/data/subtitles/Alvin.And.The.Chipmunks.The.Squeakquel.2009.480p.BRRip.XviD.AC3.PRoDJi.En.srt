00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:35,661
We're back!

2
00:00:44,086 --> 00:00:46,171
Let's go!

3
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:50,527
Nuts.

4
00:01:53,405 --> 00:01:54,573
Give me the Black Beauty.

5
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:56,742
Alvin! Alvin! Alvin!

6
00:01:56,867 --> 00:02:00,579
Alvin, take it easy out there.
You gotta share the spotlight.

7
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:02,164
You got it, Dave.

8
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:04,917
Dave?

9
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:08,003
I'm serious, Alvin.
This is a charity benefit.

10
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,880
It's not all about you.

11
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:13,967
Sorry, Dave, I can't hear you over the
thousands of fans screaming my name.

12
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:18,347
I'm back, Paris!

13
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:25,270
Yeah! A little help, boys.

14
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,197
Yeah!

15
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:40,285
Yeah, man!

16
00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:47,167
Alvin, will you please get down
from there?

17
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:48,710
I can't hear you!

18
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:51,880
- Alvin, I'm not kidding!
- What?

19
00:02:56,552 --> 00:02:58,053
Dave, look out!

20
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,599
Alvin!

21
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,060
Dave!

22
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:08,230
Dave!

23
00:03:09,565 --> 00:03:10,649
Dave?

24
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:16,780
This should help with the pain.

25
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:18,532
I wanna talk to my boys.

26
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:24,830
I just gave you a sedative that will
take effect in about one minute, so...

27
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:26,915
Well, let them in quickly.

28
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:32,379
- Dave!
- Dave, you're alive!

29
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:34,923
- Hey, guys!
- It was an accident, I swear.

30
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,426
- Are you okay?
- I'm really sorry, Dave.

31
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:40,220
I'll be fine. I'm just gonna be
stuck here for a while.

32
00:03:41,597 --> 00:03:43,765
And until I get out,
I've made arrangements

33
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:45,934
for my Aunt Jackie
to come stay with you.

34
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,061
- Who's Aunt Jackie?
- The one who sends us

35
00:03:48,187 --> 00:03:50,564
those metal buckets of yummy popcorn
for Christmas.

36
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:52,232
Oh, Popcorn Jackie.

37
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:53,734
You don't have much time,
monsieur Seville.

38
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:57,821
Listen, I want you guys to go home
and live a normal childhood.

39
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:03,994
I've even made arrangements
for you to go to school.

40
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:06,705
- School?
- Yes, school.

41
00:04:07,623 --> 00:04:10,501
Simon, I'm putting you in charge.

42
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,797
- You are?
- I'm counting on you.

43
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,800
Dave, wait a minute. Why is he in charge?

44
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:21,094
He's counting on me.

45
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,971
Dave, please don't die.

46
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,140
He's just sleeping. He's had a sedative.

47
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:27,309
A sedative.

48
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:30,896
Excuse me.
I'm here to escort the Chipmunks home.

49
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:34,691
We're not leaving Dave.
I'm putting my paw down on this one.

50
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,360
You come here!

51
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:42,491
I got it. I'll fix it. Nope, made it worse.

52
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:45,035
- Please. Please go.
- Oh, this must be it.

53
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:47,120
The more stress you put
on monsieur Seville,

54
00:04:47,246 --> 00:04:48,830
the longer it will take him to recover!

55
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:52,209
You are too slow for me, nurse.

56
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:54,044
- No! Don't...
- You'll never take me!

57
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:56,463
I'm not going anywhere without...

58
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:08,016
I hope for your sake he stays asleep
for the entire flight.

59
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:11,478
Maybe we should give him another shot,
just to be sure.

60
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:24,992
Any ideas on how we find Aunt Jackie?

61
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:27,119
Got it! Follow me.

62
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:32,791
Excuse me. Sorry.
Excuse me. Coming through.

63
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:35,002
Look! Aunt Jackie!

64
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:37,462
- Oh, yeah! Aunt Jackie!
- Popcorn Jackie!

65
00:05:37,588 --> 00:05:39,548
- Oh, hello, dears!
- Cool wheelchair.

66
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:43,218
- Yay, we found you!
- Popcorn! Where's Simon and Theodore's?

67
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:46,722
There's plenty for everyone.
But let's have a hug first.

68
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:49,266
Get over here, you old teddy bear!

69
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:51,935
I'm not really much of a hugger.

70
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,939
Boys, I want you to meet someone.
This is my grandson Toby.

71
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:58,192
- Toby?
- Hi! I'm Theodore.

72
00:05:58,317 --> 00:06:00,569
- Toby.
- What? What happened? What?

73
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:02,112
- The boys.
- Hey.

74
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:03,697
- Hi!
- Hey! How are you?

75
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:06,283
- I'm Toby. Nice to meet you.
- Toby's living with me

76
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:08,577
till he figures out
what he wants to do with his life.

77
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:10,996
So far, that means going
"pyu, pyu- pyu- pyu- pyu"

78
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:12,915
- with his thumbs all day.
- Well, for the record,

79
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,375
going "pyu- pyu- pyu- pyu- pyu"
with my thumbs right now

80
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:17,711
is keeping me in first place.
So that's important.

81
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:19,713
- Toby, get the bags.
- What bags?

82
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:22,174
- The luggage. Get the luggage.
- The... The... Right.

83
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:24,301
Yeah, let me get those. Sorry.

84
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:28,180
- Toby?
- Hit the brakes! Hit the brakes!

85
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:29,973
Abandon wheelchair!

86
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:33,519
Toby!

87
00:06:33,936 --> 00:06:35,020
Toby!

88
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:37,940
I'm fine. Don't worry.

89
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:46,698
I'm so sorry, Aunt Jackie. I'm so sorry!
Is she gonna be okay?

90
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:49,409
Don't worry about me.
I'll be home in no time.

91
00:06:49,535 --> 00:06:52,496
- In you go.
- I wouldn't be so sure.

92
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:55,833
What? It was an accident. I swear.

93
00:06:56,792 --> 00:06:59,670
Been there, done that. Several times.

94
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,047
I guess you'll be taking care of us now.

95
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:04,967
I'll take "Frightening Thoughts"
for $500, please, Alex.

96
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:09,429
Not a problem. I can totally do this.
I took care of my cat,

97
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:14,017
until he ran away. Well, "ran away"
is kind of strong wording.

98
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,686
I think he just wanted his space.

99
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:18,188
I still see him around
the neighborhood, you know.

100
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:21,024
He, like, hisses and claws at me,

101
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,944
but I think that's just his way
of saying we're still tight. You know.

102
00:07:25,571 --> 00:07:27,030
You guys have nothing to worry
about, seriously,

103
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:29,408
'cause I'm not gonna be like Dave.
You know, Dave's gone.

104
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:31,243
Gone?

105
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,497
Not gone. Not gone, guys. He's...
He's not dead. He's very much alive.

106
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,666
He's completely coming back.
I'm just gonna be in his room,

107
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,668
keeping his bed warm.
I'm gonna be doing my thing,

108
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:42,129
you'll be doing your thing.
You're not even gonna know I'm there.

109
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:44,214
We're supposed to know you're there.

110
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:46,383
That's... That's the whole idea.

111
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:49,803
Yeah. Yeah! Oh, yeah. Absolutely.
Yeah, you'll know that I'm there.

112
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:52,806
I'm just saying, I'm not gonna be,
like, "I know everything"

113
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:56,268
and, "You do this, and you do that,"
like my dad.

114
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:00,063
All right! Let's do this.

115
00:08:02,191 --> 00:08:03,442
Oh, boy.

116
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:15,037
Theodore, we're gonna be just fine.

117
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:18,624
The important thing is
we're all still alive.

118
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:22,711
Maybe my get well card
will help Dave get home faster.

119
00:08:24,296 --> 00:08:26,840
It needs just a touch more glitter.

120
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:33,639
Yep, that should do it. Who's hungry?

121
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:36,850
- Me! Me! Me!
- Let's eat.

122
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:39,811
Simon?

123
00:08:39,937 --> 00:08:42,523
It's a food ghost town in here. Alvin?

124
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:46,068
Holla! The Cheese Balls
are in the hizzouse!

125
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:49,071
<i>* Well you can tell
by the way I use my walk</i>

126
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:52,157
<i>* I'm a Cheese Balls man
No time to talk</i>

127
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:54,368
<i>* Whether you're a brother
or whether you're a mother</i>

128
00:08:54,493 --> 00:08:57,246
<i>* You gotta love Cheese Balls
Gotta love Cheese Balls</i>

129
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:02,334
<i>* Get in my belly
Cheese Balls, get in there</i>

130
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:09,925
<i>* Stayin' alive</i>

131
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:17,891
Bingo! Dinner, she's a- served.

132
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:20,894
- Yay! All right!
- Hey! What're you doing in here?

133
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:24,481
- Cheese Ball?
- Dude, let's go! Come on!

134
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:26,900
Tom- bo, hey, hey,
give me a second, real quick.

135
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:29,820
Alvin, I really, really need
to focus right now

136
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:33,240
because I am one knockout away
from a heavyweight title.

137
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:35,242
Can we play as well?

138
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,495
You know,
I don't wanna hurt your feelings,

139
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,080
but I also don't wanna see
anybody get hurt,

140
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:42,374
and there are gonna be
fists of fury a- flying.

141
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:46,461
We can play Monopoly.
We play Monopoly with Dave all the time.

142
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:48,714
Do you? That sounds fun,
and we should do that sometime,

143
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:50,465
but right now I gotta get back
to floating like a butterfly

144
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,050
and stinging like a bee. So...

145
00:09:52,176 --> 00:09:54,219
Hey, Tom- bo, you still there, buddy?

146
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:59,099
Who needs Toby, Theodore? You got us!

147
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:02,811
Yeah, who needs Toby?
Boys, right this way.

148
00:10:21,747 --> 00:10:23,248
I'm gonna puke!

149
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:27,377
Do you know what Dave would say
if he were here right now?

150
00:10:27,503 --> 00:10:29,463
- Alvin!
- Alvin!

151
00:10:29,588 --> 00:10:32,716
Not bad. But I think it needs to come
more from the belly.

152
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:34,843
- Alvin!
- Alvin!

153
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:40,140
Phone. Get it together.

154
00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:43,060
Be cool.

155
00:10:43,185 --> 00:10:44,561
- Hello?
- Yes?

156
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:46,271
- Boys, it's me.
- Dave!

157
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:48,315
Dave? As in, "Dave"?

158
00:10:48,774 --> 00:10:50,317
Well, I guess
since you answered the phone,

159
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:53,362
- you haven't burned down the house yet.
- Have a little faith, Dave.

160
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,656
Yeah. Mayday!

161
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,869
- What was that?
- Don't stress him out.

162
00:11:01,537 --> 00:11:03,539
That was Aunt Jackie. Yeah.

163
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:07,000
She's making us a zesty 5- course meal.

164
00:11:07,835 --> 00:11:09,545
Really? Well, can I talk to her?

165
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:13,549
- She's practicing her pole dancing.
- Pole dancing?

166
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:16,426
What happened to making dinner?
Guys, what's going on?

167
00:11:16,552 --> 00:11:18,720
- Gotta go, Dave.
- Alvin, I'm not kidding.

168
00:11:18,846 --> 00:11:20,973
- Feel better.
- Alvin!

169
00:11:22,558 --> 00:11:24,977
Yep. Nobody does that better than him.

170
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:57,467
Toby? Toby, wake up.

171
00:12:01,972 --> 00:12:03,265
Sorry.

172
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:06,643
No, that's... That's okay. What is it?

173
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:08,145
I had a nightmare.

174
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:12,024
The nightmares.
I hate the nightmares. What was it?

175
00:12:13,275 --> 00:12:16,111
I dreamt we didn't have a family anymore.

176
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,449
Theodore.
Theodore, that couldn't happen.

177
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:24,077
No, you guys are tight.
Nothing could ever separate you.

178
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:27,956
Unless, like, an eagle swooped down
from the sky and was like, caw- caw!

179
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:30,250
- What?
- And grabbed you and...

180
00:12:33,921 --> 00:12:36,590
Which... Which couldn't happen, ever.
So why would you...

181
00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:38,258
Why would you ever think that
that would ever happen?

182
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:40,636
You know, 'cause the Eagles
are in Philadelphia.

183
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:42,471
No! No!

184
00:12:43,222 --> 00:12:44,681
Sweet dreams.

185
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:54,816
- Toby! Toby, make it stop!
- What are you doing?

186
00:12:54,942 --> 00:12:58,862
There's something wrong with the clock!
It won't shut up! I can't sleep!

187
00:13:00,364 --> 00:13:04,910
That's the point. It's an alarm clock.

188
00:13:05,035 --> 00:13:07,538
It helps you wake up early in the morning.

189
00:13:07,663 --> 00:13:10,791
- Why would anyone wanna wake up early?
- Well, for school.

190
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:13,502
- You gotta be there by 8:00.
- In the morning?

191
00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:15,921
Look, I don't like getting up this early
any more than you do.

192
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:18,715
But we are in this together, Alvin.

193
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:23,262
Sooner you get to school, sooner I get
to come home and get back to sleep.

194
00:13:23,387 --> 00:13:25,764
You mean,
you don't stay with us at school?

195
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:28,600
No, no... No, I've done my time,
thank you very much.

196
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:30,143
But school is fun, right?

197
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:33,564
Fun? Well, I guess maybe it's fun- ish.

198
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:37,276
Hey, it's my cat!
Hey, remember I was telling you? Hey!

199
00:13:37,401 --> 00:13:39,903
Hey! Hey, kitty. It's me. Remember?

200
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:46,952
I treated you good.

201
00:14:08,557 --> 00:14:10,142
Okay, here we go.

202
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,730
Enjoy your first day at school.
See you around 3:00- ish.

203
00:14:17,024 --> 00:14:18,066
Okay.

204
00:14:23,113 --> 00:14:26,200
We got this. This'll be a walk in the park.

205
00:14:27,618 --> 00:14:29,995
A chaotic and frightening
walk in the park!

206
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:33,624
Hi, I'm Theodore. Hi, I'm Theodore.
Hi, I'm Theodore.

207
00:14:33,749 --> 00:14:35,250
- Watch out!
- Look out!

208
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:37,544
Hi, I'm...

209
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:40,047
Guys? Guys?

210
00:14:42,591 --> 00:14:44,051
Oh, boy!

211
00:14:44,927 --> 00:14:47,137
- Eagle!
- Go, Eagles!

212
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:48,847
Eagle!

213
00:14:56,772 --> 00:14:58,774
That wasn't very fun- ish.

214
00:15:00,609 --> 00:15:03,987
You must be our new students.
I'm Dr. Rubin, the principal.

215
00:15:04,488 --> 00:15:06,406
And we're the Chipmunks.

216
00:15:07,491 --> 00:15:10,577
Yes, well, that would explain
the fur and the bushy tails.

217
00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:12,412
Follow me, gentlemen.

218
00:15:12,538 --> 00:15:14,623
Gentlemen? Oh, us. Right.

219
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:18,710
There was a minute left and
we were down by 2. And I'm like,

220
00:15:18,836 --> 00:15:22,714
"Coach, I don't care if my leg's broken.
Put me in. I can win this."

221
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:27,135
- I never get tired of this story.
- So I hobble out, barely able to stand.

222
00:15:27,261 --> 00:15:28,929
Did I mention my leg was broken?

223
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:31,932
- Miss Ortega.
- Yes?

224
00:15:32,057 --> 00:15:33,600
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

225
00:15:34,476 --> 00:15:37,563
- Hello, guys. Welcome to homeroom.
- Good to be here.

226
00:15:37,688 --> 00:15:40,357
- I hope.
- So this is a classroom.

227
00:15:41,817 --> 00:15:44,278
I love the smell of zit cream
in the morning.

228
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:47,948
Hello, ladies.

229
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:49,867
- Is that the Chipmunks?
- The Chipmunks!

230
00:15:49,992 --> 00:15:51,660
We love you, Alvin!

231
00:15:54,329 --> 00:15:56,915
Hi, I'm Theodore. Hi, I'm Theodore.

232
00:15:57,833 --> 00:16:01,044
Yes, he's Theodore, in case you missed it.
And I am Simon.

233
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:05,465
The name's Seville. Alvin Seville.

234
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:15,184
Somebody's gonna have to
knock those guys down to size.

235
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:18,228
Well, that should be pretty easy.
I mean, they're only 8 inches tall.

236
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:45,923
I had 15 cars.

237
00:16:46,715 --> 00:16:50,010
I mean, that's, like, 5 more cars
than anybody really needs.

238
00:16:50,552 --> 00:16:55,098
I had 7 maids.
I had courtside seats to the Lakers.

239
00:16:56,558 --> 00:16:59,645
Even my maids had
courtside seats to the Lakers.

240
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:03,690
And now look at me. Look at me!

241
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:06,151
- Alvin and the Chipmunks!
- I lost everything.

242
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:08,529
Except for my dignity.
They can't take that away from me.

243
00:17:10,906 --> 00:17:12,741
And it's all because of them.

244
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:17,579
Hey. Breakfast.

245
00:17:19,164 --> 00:17:21,375
Now I run around hoping and praying

246
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,211
that I can find other animals
that can sing or dance. I mean...

247
00:17:25,546 --> 00:17:28,006
Wait a second. You don't sing, do you?

248
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:30,717
Hey! Hey! That's my muffin!

249
00:17:30,843 --> 00:17:33,720
Give me my muffin, you dirty rat!

250
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:39,643
I will get you, Chipmunks.

251
00:17:49,278 --> 00:17:51,113
Girls, we gotta get out of here.

252
00:17:51,822 --> 00:17:55,033
- I can't see.
- Not on my nose!

253
00:17:55,367 --> 00:17:56,743
- That's my tail!
- Sorry.

254
00:17:56,869 --> 00:17:58,495
- Move your butt!
- Okay.

255
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,913
Who's squishing me?

256
00:18:06,295 --> 00:18:08,255
We made it. Jett Records.

257
00:18:11,008 --> 00:18:15,929
Oh, my gosh. That's him. Ian Hawke.
Mr. Hawke?

258
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:20,642
That voice. I can't get it out of my head.

259
00:18:22,144 --> 00:18:23,937
Hello? Mr. Hawke!

260
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:27,399
That's not in my head.
That's really happening.

261
00:18:28,275 --> 00:18:30,944
- What do you want?
- We want to introduce ourselves.

262
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:35,199
That's right. I'm Brittany,
and this is my sister Eleanor.

263
00:18:35,324 --> 00:18:38,410
Hello, sir. Such a pleasure to meet you.

264
00:18:38,535 --> 00:18:40,162
And I'm their sister Jeanette.

265
00:18:40,287 --> 00:18:43,415
Although I feel more like an Olivia,
or sometimes a...

266
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,542
Anyway, we're the Chipettes.

267
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:49,630
And, well, we would just be so honored
to have you represent us.

268
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:53,008
You made Alvin and the Chipmunks stars.
We wanna be stars, too.

269
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:55,344
- Yeah.
- And hang out with the Chipmunks.

270
00:18:55,886 --> 00:18:59,515
Okay, now, listen, before we get
all girlie and giggly about this,

271
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,018
just tell me one thing.
You can sing, right?

272
00:19:06,688 --> 00:19:08,524
No, no, wait. Hang on. Not here.

273
00:19:09,608 --> 00:19:13,195
Why don't we take this meeting upstairs
in my penthouse office?

274
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,490
Sure! This is so exciting.

275
00:19:16,615 --> 00:19:18,116
We're really on our way now.

276
00:19:20,118 --> 00:19:25,415
Oh, my gosh. Guys, can you believe it?
My first penthouse office!

277
00:19:26,542 --> 00:19:28,210
- Wow!
- Oh, boy!

278
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:32,339
Oh, my. The Hollywood sign.

279
00:19:32,673 --> 00:19:34,800
Thought you might like the view.

280
00:19:34,925 --> 00:19:37,469
So, ladies, tell me a little something
about yourselves.

281
00:19:37,594 --> 00:19:41,223
Well, we grew up in a small town,
population 300, and...

282
00:19:41,348 --> 00:19:43,976
Yeah? Really? That's fascinating. Great.

283
00:19:44,643 --> 00:19:46,478
All right, impress me.

284
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:50,399
1, 2, 3.

285
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:27,144
Girls, girls, girls, girls.

286
00:20:28,103 --> 00:20:32,441
Guess who just became the number one
Chipette fan in the whole dang world?

287
00:20:32,566 --> 00:20:34,109
Ian Hawke, that's who.

288
00:20:34,276 --> 00:20:36,612
- Yay! Nice!
- Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh!

289
00:20:36,737 --> 00:20:38,530
So when can we meet the Chipmunks?

290
00:20:40,115 --> 00:20:44,077
That's an excellent question.
And the excellent answer is,

291
00:20:44,203 --> 00:20:47,539
I don't really represent
Alvin and the Chipmunks anymore.

292
00:20:47,664 --> 00:20:49,625
- Oh, no!
- What happened?

293
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:54,004
Classic tale. Sweet and innocent
when I met them, and they had nothing.

294
00:20:54,129 --> 00:20:57,549
And then I work my butt off
to make them rock stars,

295
00:20:58,050 --> 00:20:59,676
and they changed.

296
00:21:00,302 --> 00:21:02,679
Turned on me like bad cheese.

297
00:21:03,222 --> 00:21:05,516
- No!
- That's terrible.

298
00:21:05,641 --> 00:21:10,562
I know! I mean, I treated Alvin
like he was my own son, you know?

299
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:13,315
And then he just goes and spits on me.

300
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,653
Literally. He filled his chipmunk cheeks
with saliva and just had at it.

301
00:21:17,778 --> 00:21:20,239
And don't even get me started
about Simon.

302
00:21:20,364 --> 00:21:22,449
But not Theodore, right?

303
00:21:23,075 --> 00:21:25,202
It's the cuddly ones
you have to watch out for.

304
00:21:25,577 --> 00:21:26,954
But what are we talking about them for?

305
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:30,082
Come on! They're over.
Tired. Novelty act.

306
00:21:30,207 --> 00:21:31,625
Chipmunks who can sing.

307
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:37,214
But girl chipmunks who can sing?

308
00:21:38,882 --> 00:21:40,092
Fasten your seatbelts!

309
00:21:43,512 --> 00:21:47,975
So, I'm on Jay- Z's yacht, right?
And I say, "Jay, where's Beyoncé?"

310
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:51,645
And he says, "She's holding a plate
full of Cheese Balls. Turn around."

311
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:53,522
And guess what? She was!

312
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:56,984
P.S., Dave left me in charge.

313
00:21:57,109 --> 00:21:59,820
Staying up till 10:00 every night.
Oh, yeah!

314
00:21:59,945 --> 00:22:02,322
Hey, girls, look what I can do.

315
00:22:04,366 --> 00:22:06,326
You are Theodore- able.

316
00:22:06,451 --> 00:22:07,995
- Thank you.
- You're so cute.

317
00:22:10,497 --> 00:22:12,666
I am so sorry.

318
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:15,627
- It's cool. No harm done.
- Not yet.

319
00:22:16,253 --> 00:22:18,172
Girls? Please? Private conference.

320
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:20,924
Thank you.

321
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,514
Listen up, rock stars.

322
00:22:28,473 --> 00:22:31,351
If you talk to those girls again,
you're dead.

323
00:22:31,643 --> 00:22:34,521
If you look at those girls again,
you're dead.

324
00:22:34,646 --> 00:22:37,274
If you even think about those girls...

325
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,443
Are you thinking about them?

326
00:22:39,568 --> 00:22:41,069
Well, I am now!

327
00:22:42,487 --> 00:22:43,989
That's it. You're dead!

328
00:22:44,156 --> 00:22:46,533
- Run!
- Xander! Come on!

329
00:22:46,658 --> 00:22:49,536
- Back here, you dirty rats!
- Hang ten, bros!

330
00:22:52,706 --> 00:22:53,916
Scatter!

331
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:57,461
Go, go! That way! Over there!

332
00:22:58,212 --> 00:22:59,463
Ryan!

333
00:23:00,589 --> 00:23:02,883
Hey, slowpokes! Catch me if you can!

334
00:23:07,095 --> 00:23:09,223
- You're dead, fur ball.
- Not!

335
00:23:09,765 --> 00:23:12,893
- It's wedgie time!
- My butt!

336
00:23:21,777 --> 00:23:25,197
Oh, boy. Eagle.

337
00:23:27,199 --> 00:23:29,326
- Eagle! Eagle!
- Get them!

338
00:23:29,743 --> 00:23:32,246
- Bully! Bully!
- This way! This way!

339
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:34,039
Gotcha!

340
00:23:34,164 --> 00:23:36,166
- Guys, wait, wait. Time out!
- It's swirlie time!

341
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:38,669
Come on, come on, guys. This is so 1980s.

342
00:23:38,794 --> 00:23:40,254
Please! Please!

343
00:23:42,089 --> 00:23:44,091
Oh, man! Come on.

344
00:23:44,216 --> 00:23:46,760
- That's a good look for you.
- Thank you.

345
00:23:48,846 --> 00:23:50,264
Can't swim. Help!

346
00:23:51,098 --> 00:23:52,474
Grab on, Simon.

347
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,437
Thanks.

348
00:23:59,481 --> 00:24:00,607
You okay?

349
00:24:00,732 --> 00:24:04,194
Well, considering that you just
saved me from drowning in a toilet,

350
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:06,572
I'm pretty good.

351
00:24:06,697 --> 00:24:08,365
I'll be right back.

352
00:24:08,657 --> 00:24:11,201
Alvin! Alvin! We're not going
to solve anything with violence.

353
00:24:11,326 --> 00:24:13,287
- It's the fatty- ratty!
- Cut it out!

354
00:24:13,412 --> 00:24:15,330
This rat has serious junk in the trunk.

355
00:24:15,455 --> 00:24:16,957
- Yeah, little fatty!
- Stop it!

356
00:24:17,082 --> 00:24:18,625
He jiggles when I poke him.

357
00:24:21,003 --> 00:24:23,005
Mommy!

358
00:24:25,465 --> 00:24:27,968
Simon, does this make my butt
look smaller?

359
00:24:28,093 --> 00:24:31,722
Theodore, your butt looks fine.
Those guys are just jerks.

360
00:24:38,812 --> 00:24:40,147
Gentlemen.

361
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,152
You threatened to climb inside of him
and build a nest.

362
00:24:45,277 --> 00:24:47,029
That was out of line.

363
00:24:47,196 --> 00:24:49,531
I'm not even sure
that's physically possible.

364
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,785
I should suspend all 3 of you.

365
00:24:53,911 --> 00:24:55,204
Please do.

366
00:25:03,629 --> 00:25:05,839
Instead, I have a better idea.

367
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,634
Due to budget cutbacks,

368
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:12,221
we are in jeopardy of losing
our beloved music program.

369
00:25:12,346 --> 00:25:13,680
- That's awful.
- I know.

370
00:25:13,805 --> 00:25:16,266
But there is one small ray of hope.

371
00:25:16,892 --> 00:25:19,686
Every year the district sponsors
a music competition.

372
00:25:19,811 --> 00:25:23,106
And the winner's school receives $25,000.

373
00:25:23,649 --> 00:25:26,026
If we win, we can save our program.

374
00:25:26,151 --> 00:25:28,862
And you want us to perform?

375
00:25:28,987 --> 00:25:31,573
'Cause I didn't think you were a fan.

376
00:25:32,783 --> 00:25:34,785
Why don't you sleep on it?

377
00:25:35,786 --> 00:25:38,163
Wait a minute! What is that? That's us!

378
00:25:38,288 --> 00:25:39,540
- Wait.
- I look skinny.

379
00:25:40,082 --> 00:25:41,959
Promise me that you won't say anything.

380
00:25:42,084 --> 00:25:43,502
A principal has a certain image to uphold,

381
00:25:43,627 --> 00:25:45,754
and if the faculty ever found out
about this, I could...

382
00:25:47,673 --> 00:25:51,552
I just cannot believe that you're
actually sitting in my office.

383
00:25:51,677 --> 00:25:55,222
I have all of your CDs.
I even went to see you last year in Denver.

384
00:25:55,347 --> 00:25:58,433
That's where I got this.
It was my birthday.

385
00:25:58,892 --> 00:26:01,353
And I was like, "The Chipmunks! "

386
00:26:03,105 --> 00:26:06,942
So what do you say?
Will you represent our school?

387
00:26:08,193 --> 00:26:11,697
Honestly, suspension still sounds
pretty good to me.

388
00:26:11,822 --> 00:26:16,285
Come on, Alvin. What do you say?
1 for all and 3 for 1!

389
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:18,579
Well put, Theodore. Very well put.

390
00:26:18,704 --> 00:26:20,080
Count us in.

391
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:22,666
Go, Eagles!

392
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,960
Eagles? Where?

393
00:26:29,089 --> 00:26:30,757
The penthouse level.

394
00:26:36,597 --> 00:26:40,225
Isn't that that Chihuahua?
You know, from the movie?

395
00:26:41,018 --> 00:26:43,812
Oh, yeah. Yeah, it...
I mean, yeah, of course it is.

396
00:26:43,937 --> 00:26:45,314
A lot of big names live here.

397
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:49,776
- I must have his autograph.
- Hey, hey, Brittany.

398
00:26:49,902 --> 00:26:52,237
You wanna be a star? Act like a star.

399
00:26:52,362 --> 00:26:54,323
All right?
You don't get autographs, you give them.

400
00:26:55,199 --> 00:26:56,200
Right.

401
00:26:57,993 --> 00:27:01,497
Hey, look, over there!
There're a couple of the Jonas Brothers.

402
00:27:01,622 --> 00:27:03,123
- Where?
- I don't see them.

403
00:27:03,248 --> 00:27:05,751
Here we are! Okay!

404
00:27:05,876 --> 00:27:08,504
Let's scoot in to my...

405
00:27:09,129 --> 00:27:12,758
What? Did I... Darn it! Darn it to heck!

406
00:27:12,883 --> 00:27:15,010
- What's wrong?
- Girls, I apologize,

407
00:27:15,135 --> 00:27:18,597
but I seem to have left my keys
back in my office.

408
00:27:19,598 --> 00:27:21,725
What if one of you were
to shoot through that mail slot

409
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:23,685
and open it up from the inside, huh?

410
00:27:24,228 --> 00:27:25,437
I'll do it.

411
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:29,733
I'm stuck!

412
00:27:32,361 --> 00:27:34,238
All right, I got you. I got you.

413
00:27:38,867 --> 00:27:40,494
Not so hard!

414
00:27:40,619 --> 00:27:42,996
Might want to lay off the nuts.

415
00:27:43,247 --> 00:27:46,124
All right, how about you, Glasses?
You're in better shape. Wanna go?

416
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:48,836
I'm not that great at things like this.

417
00:27:48,961 --> 00:27:50,212
I got it!

418
00:27:53,215 --> 00:27:54,299
Yes!

419
00:27:58,929 --> 00:28:01,390
- Impressive!
- Nice!

420
00:28:01,557 --> 00:28:05,561
- Gee willikers! Stripes!
- Snazzy!

421
00:28:05,686 --> 00:28:08,522
- Circles!
- This is the best tree house ever!

422
00:28:08,647 --> 00:28:11,233
- A red piano!
- Brit.

423
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,861
Is this a dream? Somebody pinch me.

424
00:28:14,778 --> 00:28:16,864
This is way better than a tree.

425
00:28:16,989 --> 00:28:19,158
I just adore a penthouse view.

426
00:28:19,783 --> 00:28:21,368
Nice one, Hawke.

427
00:28:22,578 --> 00:28:24,621
- Yeah? You like it?
- Do I?

428
00:28:24,746 --> 00:28:27,666
- I live here.
- It's so beautiful!

429
00:28:27,791 --> 00:28:28,792
Yeah.

430
00:28:31,253 --> 00:28:33,881
Last time we visited Meerkat Manor,

431
00:28:34,006 --> 00:28:36,383
a rival group called the Commandos

432
00:28:36,508 --> 00:28:39,553
was making large inroads
into the Whiskers' territory.

433
00:28:46,018 --> 00:28:48,437
Toby! I thought Alvin was messy.

434
00:28:48,562 --> 00:28:52,691
This is literally disgusting.
I feel like I'm living in a dumpster.

435
00:28:53,275 --> 00:28:56,278
Simon, it's Meerkat Manor.
Watch with me.

436
00:28:57,905 --> 00:28:59,573
You know, you're right. You're right.
I just need to relax.

437
00:28:59,698 --> 00:29:01,867
Maybe that'll ease my nerves a little.

438
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:05,496
What is this? What...

439
00:29:06,038 --> 00:29:09,750
You've got to be joking.
A taco? In a blanket? Toby!

440
00:29:11,668 --> 00:29:16,840
Ladies and gentlemen,
going for his turkey, it's the Tobester.

441
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,720
Come on, baby!

442
00:29:23,847 --> 00:29:25,140
Yes!

443
00:29:25,682 --> 00:29:26,767
Yes!

444
00:29:28,268 --> 00:29:31,271
No problem. Watch and learn, my friends.

445
00:29:35,984 --> 00:29:39,071
Well, it looks like it's time
to play my second favorite game.

446
00:29:39,196 --> 00:29:42,115
Hide the Broken TV from Dave.
You wanna play?

447
00:29:42,783 --> 00:29:45,452
- No!
- Go easy on him, taco boy.

448
00:29:45,577 --> 00:29:47,412
This day's been bad enough already.

449
00:29:50,582 --> 00:29:53,794
I think I see what's going on.

450
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:56,213
You guys have been having
some problems at school?

451
00:29:56,338 --> 00:29:58,298
No. Not really. Unless you consider

452
00:29:58,423 --> 00:30:00,843
getting your head dumped
into a public toilet a problem.

453
00:30:02,594 --> 00:30:04,471
Swirlies are the worst.

454
00:30:07,015 --> 00:30:08,976
At least that's what I've heard.

455
00:30:09,101 --> 00:30:13,230
Because there's no way that I could
possibly know that on a personal level.

456
00:30:14,439 --> 00:30:16,900
Toby, what was school like for you?

457
00:30:18,819 --> 00:30:21,446
Toby? Toby?

458
00:30:53,687 --> 00:30:56,315
- Toby? Toby!
- What?

459
00:30:57,399 --> 00:31:01,695
What was school like for me?
In a word, awesome.

460
00:31:02,571 --> 00:31:07,367
But, you know, that's 'cause
I was, like, extremely popular.

461
00:31:08,785 --> 00:31:10,537
Is that why you still live
with your grandma?

462
00:31:10,662 --> 00:31:12,664
And refer to yourself as "the Tobester"?

463
00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:14,458
And go "pyu- pyu- pyu" all day?

464
00:31:16,752 --> 00:31:17,836
Bedtime!

465
00:31:25,052 --> 00:31:26,220
Alvin?

466
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:30,265
Alvin, wake up and turn off the alarm!

467
00:31:35,103 --> 00:31:40,192
Alvin! Alvin, I'm not kidding!
I'm not kidding, buddy. Turn it off!

468
00:31:40,317 --> 00:31:41,735
Guys! Guys...

469
00:31:49,451 --> 00:31:51,245
Boys, this isn't funny.

470
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:54,414
Hello. Humane Society? Yes. I need help.

471
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:57,417
A man is after us.
He wants to take us to a terrible place.

472
00:31:58,210 --> 00:31:59,586
- School!
- Out!

473
00:31:59,711 --> 00:32:02,130
- Have a heart, huh?
- Have a heart?

474
00:32:02,256 --> 00:32:04,633
Dave wants you to go to school,
so you're going.

475
00:32:04,758 --> 00:32:07,427
Yeah, well, don't worry about
picking us up at 3:00, Toby.

476
00:32:07,553 --> 00:32:09,596
We'll get a ride. In a hearse!

477
00:32:09,721 --> 00:32:13,058
Guys, guys, come on. Look, trust me.

478
00:32:13,183 --> 00:32:15,227
The second day
is never as bad as the first.

479
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,776
Glasses! Glasses! You wouldn't hit
a guy with glasses, would you?

480
00:32:23,318 --> 00:32:24,611
You're out, man!

481
00:32:24,736 --> 00:32:26,280
Right in the pancreas.

482
00:32:31,952 --> 00:32:35,998
- Call the nurse.
- Out! Out! You're out.

483
00:32:36,123 --> 00:32:38,667
Come on, Alvin!
Remember your 5 D's!

484
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:42,129
Dodge, duck, dip, dive and dodge!

485
00:32:42,254 --> 00:32:44,423
- Move!
- You're next, fur ball.

486
00:32:44,882 --> 00:32:47,551
You talking to me? You talking to me?

487
00:32:48,468 --> 00:32:51,305
I'm the only one here,
so you must be talking to me.

488
00:32:55,684 --> 00:32:59,521
- Yeah! Got him!
- Did you see that?

489
00:33:01,773 --> 00:33:04,651
Unbelievable. He caught it.
You're out, man.

490
00:33:05,986 --> 00:33:08,405
And the fat lady, she's a- singing.

491
00:33:09,573 --> 00:33:12,075
- Dude's got hands.
- I think they're paws, actually.

492
00:33:12,201 --> 00:33:15,287
Whatever. We can definitely use him
on the team.

493
00:33:15,704 --> 00:33:18,916
Hey, fur ball! How would you like
a spot on the football team?

494
00:33:19,041 --> 00:33:20,042
Football?

495
00:33:20,626 --> 00:33:23,795
I gotta say, you're good. I'm gonna
let you hang out with us at lunch.

496
00:33:24,505 --> 00:33:29,301
- That is, if you wanna be on the team.
- Interesting proposition.

497
00:33:29,468 --> 00:33:32,304
- Alvin?
- Let me get back to you on that.

498
00:33:32,429 --> 00:33:35,140
This is a one- time offer.
Don't take too long to think it over.

499
00:33:36,767 --> 00:33:41,146
Right! Like I would ditch my brothers
just to become the first chipmunk ever

500
00:33:41,271 --> 00:33:43,482
to play on an actual varsity football team.

501
00:33:44,358 --> 00:33:45,734
Fat chance!

502
00:33:47,152 --> 00:33:53,158
The stadium is pandemonium!
It's 4th and goal. It's up! It's up!

503
00:33:53,283 --> 00:33:57,204
And he catches it! The crowd goes crazy!

504
00:33:59,665 --> 00:34:00,666
Hey!

505
00:34:02,876 --> 00:34:07,172
- Me?
- Alvin! Alvin! Alvin!

506
00:34:08,507 --> 00:34:11,969
Alvin, I think the super- cool jock table
is paging you.

507
00:34:13,011 --> 00:34:17,349
Why would I go over there? Like I really
need to worry about being popular.

508
00:34:17,474 --> 00:34:21,270
Hello? Talking chipmunk? Huh?
World- famous rock star?

509
00:34:21,395 --> 00:34:25,232
Guy with his own plush doll?
Guys, I'm on pajamas!

510
00:34:25,357 --> 00:34:26,775
Not to toot my own horn, but...

511
00:34:29,528 --> 00:34:32,656
Come on. It's laughable.

512
00:34:34,241 --> 00:34:36,577
- Just go, Alvin.
- Really? You mean it?

513
00:34:36,702 --> 00:34:39,580
- Yeah.
- Thanks! I'll be right back!

514
00:34:42,291 --> 00:34:43,709
- What up, dudes?
- What's up, little man?

515
00:34:43,834 --> 00:34:46,044
- Welcome to the cool table.
- Yeah! Bring it.

516
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:47,880
- Yeah!
- Pound the paw.

517
00:34:55,304 --> 00:35:00,559
I want it! I got it! I got it! I...

518
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:02,519
Don't got it.

519
00:35:02,644 --> 00:35:04,730
- I think he's cute.
- Me, too.

520
00:35:05,772 --> 00:35:08,525
Toss. And he's up!

521
00:35:11,111 --> 00:35:13,238
- Thank you.
- Hey, Alvin.

522
00:35:14,406 --> 00:35:15,532
Call me.

523
00:35:15,991 --> 00:35:19,119
Bernie, I'm telling you,
the Chipmunks are old news.

524
00:35:19,244 --> 00:35:23,415
I got the next big thing.
Singing female chipmunks.

525
00:35:25,125 --> 00:35:27,544
Hello? Bernie? Hello?

526
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:32,966
God! What part of "singing female
chipmunks" don't these people...

527
00:35:35,761 --> 00:35:38,597
Girls, we're going to school.

528
00:35:39,806 --> 00:35:43,018
And he's up and he scores!

529
00:35:44,895 --> 00:35:46,688
Hey! What up, S?

530
00:35:48,273 --> 00:35:50,400
Don't hate on the high- five.

531
00:35:51,318 --> 00:35:52,945
Yeah. High- five.

532
00:35:53,445 --> 00:35:55,155
Look, Alvin,
I know you guys have been busy

533
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,033
with your sporting endeavors
and whatnot,

534
00:35:58,158 --> 00:36:00,244
but I can really use your help at home.

535
00:36:00,369 --> 00:36:01,787
No can do.

536
00:36:01,912 --> 00:36:05,207
Ry- dawg is gonna teach me how to get
pretty girls to do my homework.

537
00:36:06,875 --> 00:36:10,045
Alvin, you promised Theodore
we'd hang out.

538
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:13,173
We are watching Meerkat Manor tonight.
No pretty girls.

539
00:36:13,298 --> 00:36:17,302
- Dude, I can't swing it today, bro.
- That's what you say every day, Alvin.

540
00:36:17,427 --> 00:36:19,930
Need I remind you
it's your day to do the laundry?

541
00:36:20,055 --> 00:36:24,768
You better listen to your daddy, Alvin.
You don't wanna get grounded.

542
00:36:26,979 --> 00:36:29,147
Are you going to pick that up?

543
00:36:29,356 --> 00:36:31,024
Are you going to make me?

544
00:36:33,026 --> 00:36:35,696
I'm just going to elegantly show you
how it's done.

545
00:36:36,697 --> 00:36:38,073
Simon...

546
00:36:39,449 --> 00:36:40,951
Off the glass.

547
00:36:42,369 --> 00:36:44,163
And you call yourself a jock.

548
00:36:48,709 --> 00:36:52,754
My brother, he's a real jokester.
Always kidding.

549
00:36:53,213 --> 00:36:55,716
Anyhoo, see you guys in class.

550
00:36:57,384 --> 00:36:59,928
- Hey, that's my pudding.
- It's my pudding.

551
00:37:01,263 --> 00:37:03,682
Why are you trying to embarrass me
in front of my friends?

552
00:37:03,807 --> 00:37:07,060
Are you kidding me? They're the ones
you should be embarrassed by.

553
00:37:07,186 --> 00:37:10,147
- Good luck with the show, guys.
- Front row seats. Can't wait.

554
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:12,065
So? What song are we gonna sing?

555
00:37:12,191 --> 00:37:15,027
No pressure,
but the whole school is counting on us.

556
00:37:15,152 --> 00:37:19,031
Relax. It's like Ryan says,
who's gonna beat singing chipmunks?

557
00:37:46,308 --> 00:37:48,769
That Simon is dreamy!

558
00:37:48,894 --> 00:37:50,896
I think Theodore was looking at me.

559
00:37:51,021 --> 00:37:54,566
Yeah, I know.
But, guys, remember what Ian said?

560
00:37:54,691 --> 00:37:56,151
We can't trust them.

561
00:38:15,963 --> 00:38:18,340
- Wow.
- What happened?

562
00:38:18,465 --> 00:38:22,761
I never thought I'd say this,
but pink is my new favorite color.

563
00:38:22,886 --> 00:38:25,013
Her glasses were quite fetching.

564
00:38:25,138 --> 00:38:27,975
She's like a beautiful green gumdrop.

565
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:32,396
Okay, well, if you guys wanna do this,
you have to pay attention.

566
00:38:32,521 --> 00:38:34,773
Maybe this is a good time
for us to take a break.

567
00:38:34,898 --> 00:38:36,275
Good call. Take 5.

568
00:38:37,484 --> 00:38:40,279
- She's right. We need to focus, fellas.
- Right.

569
00:38:40,404 --> 00:38:42,030
This is for my screensaver.

570
00:38:43,365 --> 00:38:44,783
Cheese Balls!

571
00:38:44,908 --> 00:38:47,703
Hey, you guys! Hey.
You guys ready to go?

572
00:38:47,828 --> 00:38:49,454
'Cause I got a lot of important stuff
to do at home.

573
00:38:49,913 --> 00:38:51,957
You must be their guardian.

574
00:38:52,249 --> 00:38:54,543
That I... That I am. Yes, I am.

575
00:38:54,668 --> 00:38:56,962
Hi, how are you? How are you, Dr. Rubin?

576
00:38:57,087 --> 00:38:58,964
I know that because
I went to school here a few years ago.

577
00:38:59,089 --> 00:39:01,466
I don't know if you remember me.
Toby Seville? Probably not.

578
00:39:03,218 --> 00:39:04,219
Toby?

579
00:39:05,929 --> 00:39:10,100
No way! Hi! Hey, no braces.

580
00:39:11,185 --> 00:39:13,854
- Your teeth look great.
- You... I... Thank you. I appreciate...

581
00:39:13,979 --> 00:39:17,983
I did. I did. I did get my braces off
'cause they were just...

582
00:39:21,778 --> 00:39:22,863
Okay.

583
00:39:29,369 --> 00:39:32,831
That... You know what,
I know a guy who actually...

584
00:39:32,956 --> 00:39:35,292
Who works on drum heads.
So that's very good.

585
00:39:35,417 --> 00:39:37,252
I'll be in the car, guys. So...

586
00:39:39,379 --> 00:39:41,089
Somebody's in love.

587
00:39:41,215 --> 00:39:44,676
That aside, we're going to replace
everything. Chipmunk's honor.

588
00:39:44,801 --> 00:39:48,388
Yes, the old false- modesty
suck- up routine.

589
00:39:48,514 --> 00:39:50,849
- Ian Hawke?
- I thought I smelled a rat.

590
00:39:50,974 --> 00:39:52,559
May I help you, Mr. Hawke?

591
00:39:52,684 --> 00:39:54,228
Well, I was wondering if I could help you.

592
00:39:54,353 --> 00:39:56,355
I just heard about
your musical competition,

593
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:59,399
and I just skedaddled down here as quick
as I could to volunteer my girls.

594
00:40:00,275 --> 00:40:03,904
Well, that's very thoughtful of you,
but I've already made up my mind.

595
00:40:04,029 --> 00:40:08,158
Well, perhaps this will
change your mind. Girls?

596
00:40:11,328 --> 00:40:12,830
They're with Ian?

597
00:40:12,955 --> 00:40:13,956
Curtains!

598
00:40:16,375 --> 00:40:19,044
1, 2...
1, 2...

599
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:48,740
Wow! They're good!

600
00:40:48,866 --> 00:40:50,617
Good? They're astounding!

601
00:41:24,276 --> 00:41:26,778
My good people of West Eastman,

602
00:41:26,904 --> 00:41:30,282
you have just witnessed
the debut of the Chipettes.

603
00:41:31,241 --> 00:41:33,494
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Thank you.

604
00:41:35,245 --> 00:41:36,455
So?

605
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:40,834
They were splendid, but as I said before,
I have made my decision.

606
00:41:41,668 --> 00:41:42,920
- Brit?
- No!

607
00:41:44,505 --> 00:41:47,174
I see. You've made your decision.

608
00:41:49,384 --> 00:41:51,178
I don't mean
to speak out of school, Doctor,

609
00:41:51,303 --> 00:41:53,847
but in the true spirit of democracy,

610
00:41:54,264 --> 00:41:58,477
which our great, wonderful country
was founded upon,

611
00:41:59,394 --> 00:42:03,315
I say let the people vote.
Let them choose!

612
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:07,277
One person, one vote. I say, let us vote!

613
00:42:07,778 --> 00:42:11,031
Let us vote! Let us vote!

614
00:42:11,156 --> 00:42:13,951
Let us vote! Let us vote!

615
00:42:14,535 --> 00:42:19,081
Please, don't be a fascist granny.
Let freedom ring, Doctor.

616
00:42:19,957 --> 00:42:21,041
- Let us vote!
- Let us vote!

617
00:42:21,166 --> 00:42:22,167
- Let us vote!
- Let us vote!

618
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:27,005
You make a persuasive case, Mr. Hawke.

619
00:42:29,591 --> 00:42:31,844
All right, here's what I'm going to do.

620
00:42:31,969 --> 00:42:36,056
This Friday, each group will perform
one song in front of the student body.

621
00:42:36,181 --> 00:42:37,224
- Yes!
- All right!

622
00:42:37,349 --> 00:42:40,185
Whoever gets the most applause
will represent the school.

623
00:42:40,686 --> 00:42:41,687
What?

624
00:42:42,354 --> 00:42:43,355
- Thank you!
- Yes!

625
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,606
We did it!

626
00:42:44,731 --> 00:42:45,858
In your face!

627
00:42:46,817 --> 00:42:49,069
It is on like Donkey Kong.

628
00:42:51,738 --> 00:42:54,783
The meerkats huddle together
at the end of a traumatic day

629
00:42:55,367 --> 00:42:57,786
to reaffirm their family bond.

630
00:42:57,953 --> 00:43:01,790
The Whiskers are gonna have to rely
on each other more than ever.

631
00:43:02,332 --> 00:43:06,003
Guys, I am so happy that Ms. Ortega can
rehearse with us every day after school.

632
00:43:06,628 --> 00:43:07,629
Every day?

633
00:43:07,754 --> 00:43:11,216
- But Ryan and I have...
- Alvin, stop right there, okay?

634
00:43:11,341 --> 00:43:13,385
We're a team. We need you.

635
00:43:14,178 --> 00:43:18,724
Would you relax? We're not gonna lose.
We'll talk about this in the morning.

636
00:43:19,892 --> 00:43:23,187
Not much to talk about.
I will see you at rehearsal.

637
00:43:25,063 --> 00:43:27,399
- Stop hogging.
- I'm not hogging.

638
00:43:27,858 --> 00:43:31,111
You might as well be rooting out
truffles in the French countryside,

639
00:43:31,236 --> 00:43:33,155
because you are, in fact, hogging!

640
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,531
- I'm not!
- Are so!

641
00:43:34,656 --> 00:43:37,159
- Not! Am not! Not! Not!
- So! So! So! So!

642
00:43:37,284 --> 00:43:40,078
Forget it! I think
I'll sleep in my own bed tonight.

643
00:43:40,204 --> 00:43:42,998
- Ditto for me.
- I'm so glad I'm not a meerkat!

644
00:43:43,123 --> 00:43:45,751
- Really? Why is that?
- Because as cold as I am,

645
00:43:45,876 --> 00:43:47,753
- I would never huddle with you!
- Good!

646
00:43:47,878 --> 00:43:50,547
- You hear me? I won't huddle!
- Fine!

647
00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:01,767
Toby?

648
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:04,811
Can I sleep with you?

649
00:44:07,314 --> 00:44:10,108
- What?
- Dave lets me.

650
00:44:11,026 --> 00:44:12,861
My brothers are fighting.

651
00:44:15,155 --> 00:44:18,659
Well... I'm... Okay.

652
00:44:28,836 --> 00:44:32,256
Oh, man! Dutch oven!
Not the Dutch oven!

653
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:34,758
Anything but the Dutch oven!

654
00:44:34,883 --> 00:44:37,636
Must find fresh air before it's too late!

655
00:44:38,554 --> 00:44:40,639
It's too late! It burns.

656
00:44:41,181 --> 00:44:42,683
Mama, it burns!

657
00:45:04,913 --> 00:45:08,041
Let's see. What else am I in the mood for?

658
00:45:08,709 --> 00:45:11,670
How about a side order of friendly advice?
Courtesy of me.

659
00:45:12,212 --> 00:45:13,547
No, thanks.

660
00:45:14,548 --> 00:45:15,674
Grapes, please.

661
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:20,512
- Excuse me.
- Yeah, well,

662
00:45:20,637 --> 00:45:24,183
I just wanted to warn you about Ian.

663
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:27,644
What? You should be grateful to Ian.

664
00:45:27,769 --> 00:45:30,689
He did everything for you, Alvin,
and you broke his heart.

665
00:45:31,565 --> 00:45:34,276
Really? How do I put this gently?

666
00:45:34,401 --> 00:45:36,904
He's the devil. He doesn't have a heart.

667
00:45:37,029 --> 00:45:40,699
And one of the things he did for us
was put us in a cage.

668
00:45:40,824 --> 00:45:42,576
Alvin, he would never do that.

669
00:45:42,701 --> 00:45:45,162
Yeah, 'cause you were there. I forgot.

670
00:45:45,454 --> 00:45:47,915
- Brittany, you'd better watch out.
- I don't need advice from you.

671
00:45:48,081 --> 00:45:49,541
- But...
- But nothing, Alvin.

672
00:45:49,666 --> 00:45:52,544
Ian's taking us straight to the top!

673
00:45:55,797 --> 00:45:57,841
Got it. Straight to the top.

674
00:45:57,966 --> 00:45:59,968
- Ironic.
- Yeah, funny.

675
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:09,895
We are so going
to destroy those Chipmunks.

676
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:11,897
- I don't wanna destroy them.
- Me, neither.

677
00:46:12,022 --> 00:46:13,398
I just wanna hang out with them.

678
00:46:13,524 --> 00:46:15,734
All right, all right, all right. Hold...
All right, look.

679
00:46:16,235 --> 00:46:17,236
You know, if you feel that way,

680
00:46:17,361 --> 00:46:20,239
maybe we should just
withdraw from the contest.

681
00:46:20,364 --> 00:46:22,241
- What?
- Then I'll put you in a FedEx package

682
00:46:22,366 --> 00:46:25,244
and mail you back to whatever tree
you came from. Sound good?

683
00:46:25,369 --> 00:46:26,703
- No.
- Okay, then.

684
00:46:26,829 --> 00:46:28,413
Take it from the top. Let's go!

685
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,460
All right. Wait. Stop!

686
00:46:34,127 --> 00:46:35,671
Short one in the green dress.

687
00:46:35,796 --> 00:46:37,256
- What's your name again?
- Eleanor.

688
00:46:37,381 --> 00:46:39,758
Yeah, look,
I'm losing you there, you know.

689
00:46:39,883 --> 00:46:42,427
- Have you always been that short?
- I... I guess.

690
00:46:42,678 --> 00:46:45,389
Well, you got to work on that. Okay?

691
00:46:45,806 --> 00:46:47,808
All right, let me try something here.

692
00:46:47,975 --> 00:46:49,726
Brittany. Here, come up here.

693
00:46:49,852 --> 00:46:51,812
No, you two stay back.
Little further.

694
00:46:53,021 --> 00:46:56,984
Oh, yeah. Now, that I like.

695
00:46:57,526 --> 00:46:58,902
And it's not just because Brittany's

696
00:46:59,027 --> 00:47:01,113
more of a mega, ultra superstar
than you guys.

697
00:47:01,655 --> 00:47:05,409
Good, good. Okay, you know what?
Let's get a little more separation.

698
00:47:05,534 --> 00:47:08,662
Brittany, stay there. Let's get a little
more separation from you guys.

699
00:47:08,787 --> 00:47:12,457
Yeah, let's give her some room.
Give her some room, guys. Back.

700
00:47:12,583 --> 00:47:16,712
Okay. All right, watch me now.
1, 2, 3!

701
00:47:17,087 --> 00:47:18,797
Now, watch me. Watch me now.

702
00:47:29,099 --> 00:47:30,267
Hello.

703
00:47:31,018 --> 00:47:32,352
Toby?

704
00:47:32,853 --> 00:47:35,397
What are you doing at the house?
Where's Aunt Jackie?

705
00:47:35,522 --> 00:47:39,651
Dave! Hey! Hey, Dave, what's happening?

706
00:47:42,613 --> 00:47:46,033
Aunt Jackie is in the hospital.

707
00:47:49,286 --> 00:47:51,955
I'm a little worried.
Who's watching the boys?

708
00:47:53,790 --> 00:47:54,875
I am.

709
00:47:56,502 --> 00:47:58,670
So, Dave, how is Paris?

710
00:47:58,795 --> 00:48:02,799
- Wait, are the boys behaving?
- Absolutely. They've been just peachy.

711
00:48:04,051 --> 00:48:05,469
Toby, what's going on?

712
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:09,097
Nothing. Nothing. No, don't even...
Don't even worry about it.

713
00:48:09,223 --> 00:48:10,974
You know, I know that you're
not supposed to be stressed out,

714
00:48:11,099 --> 00:48:13,227
so I'm going to go right now.
But it's all good here.

715
00:48:13,352 --> 00:48:14,770
Come home soon! Bye!

716
00:48:15,395 --> 00:48:16,480
Toby?

717
00:48:17,064 --> 00:48:18,106
Toby!

718
00:48:18,899 --> 00:48:22,486
Nurse! Nurse! Get me out of here!

719
00:48:22,736 --> 00:48:23,862
Help!

720
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:29,952
I don't mean to interrupt your game,
but I saw you stand up to Ryan

721
00:48:30,077 --> 00:48:33,413
- when he littered. That took guts.
- Really?

722
00:48:33,539 --> 00:48:35,207
And that's the type of guy
that we're looking for.

723
00:48:35,332 --> 00:48:37,334
Jeremy Smith, student body president.

724
00:48:37,459 --> 00:48:39,711
- How do you do? I'm...
- International recording star

725
00:48:39,837 --> 00:48:43,549
- and litter monitor Simon Seville.
- Litter monitor?

726
00:48:43,674 --> 00:48:45,968
Litter monitor.
It's a new position that we've created

727
00:48:46,093 --> 00:48:49,555
to help raise awareness
of a pressing problem in our society.

728
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:54,226
I agree 99% plus 1. You do the math.

729
00:48:55,769 --> 00:48:58,063
Well, Simon, I know this is a lot to ask,

730
00:48:58,188 --> 00:49:01,400
but we're looking for a take- charge guy

731
00:49:01,525 --> 00:49:05,237
to take charge
of this very rewarding position.

732
00:49:05,362 --> 00:49:06,905
What do you say?

733
00:49:08,115 --> 00:49:09,658
Excuse me, everybody.
Quick announcement.

734
00:49:09,783 --> 00:49:11,702
I'm Simon. I'm the litter monitor.

735
00:49:11,827 --> 00:49:13,704
Put your trash in the garbage can.
Peace out.

736
00:49:17,291 --> 00:49:19,501
Hello, ladies! You probably weren't aware

737
00:49:19,626 --> 00:49:21,211
that you dropped a wrapper
on the ground,

738
00:49:21,336 --> 00:49:23,463
so we're just gonna call this one
a warning.

739
00:49:26,133 --> 00:49:27,426
Carry on.

740
00:49:28,302 --> 00:49:30,762
- What up, dudes?
- What up, Al?

741
00:49:30,888 --> 00:49:32,973
Hey, everybody! Check it out!

742
00:49:33,098 --> 00:49:38,353
The newest member of the football team.
Suiting up for our first away game.

743
00:49:38,562 --> 00:49:41,940
- Ry, don't mess with me.
- I talked to coach. You're in.

744
00:49:42,107 --> 00:49:44,610
Dude! That's great! Awesome!

745
00:49:44,735 --> 00:49:48,113
So check it out, A- man.
We're watching the new litter monitor.

746
00:49:48,238 --> 00:49:51,116
I wasn't aware
the school even had a litter monitor.

747
00:49:51,241 --> 00:49:53,619
We don't. But don't tell him that.

748
00:49:56,246 --> 00:49:58,749
- Are you going to pick that up?
- No.

749
00:49:59,625 --> 00:50:01,376
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

750
00:50:01,502 --> 00:50:04,630
I guess I'm going to have to give you
a citation.

751
00:50:07,633 --> 00:50:11,512
- Oh, no! I got a citation for littering!
- Oh, no!

752
00:50:14,056 --> 00:50:16,225
You wanna play that game, do you?
Well, guess what?

753
00:50:16,350 --> 00:50:17,851
I can play that game all day long.

754
00:50:17,976 --> 00:50:19,853
- Simon!
- It's a joke, dude.

755
00:50:19,978 --> 00:50:21,355
Litter is no joking matter.

756
00:50:21,772 --> 00:50:24,733
No. You're the joke.
We're messing with you.

757
00:50:24,858 --> 00:50:26,693
There's no such thing as a litter monitor.

758
00:50:27,486 --> 00:50:29,238
- What?
- Good one, huh?

759
00:50:31,156 --> 00:50:32,783
You knew about this, Alvin?

760
00:50:33,367 --> 00:50:35,369
Does the word "brother" mean
anything to you?

761
00:50:35,494 --> 00:50:37,079
Yes. Of course.

762
00:50:37,204 --> 00:50:39,915
Yeah, well, he has some new brothers
now that he's on the football team.

763
00:50:42,876 --> 00:50:45,671
You still haven't picked up that litter.

764
00:50:45,796 --> 00:50:47,381
- You want me to get rid of litter?
- Yeah.

765
00:50:47,506 --> 00:50:50,008
- Let's start with you.
- Hey, let... Let go. Let go!

766
00:50:50,133 --> 00:50:51,134
No!

767
00:50:53,887 --> 00:50:55,472
Downtown!

768
00:50:58,684 --> 00:51:00,686
I'll catch up with you guys in a second.

769
00:51:03,021 --> 00:51:06,692
Simon! Simon!

770
00:51:07,609 --> 00:51:08,777
Simon!

771
00:51:10,445 --> 00:51:14,032
Okay, I am a total jerk, I admit it.

772
00:51:14,158 --> 00:51:15,492
So are we cool now?

773
00:51:27,546 --> 00:51:32,885
Okay. Alvin, I am going to put this
behind us for Theodore's sake.

774
00:51:33,302 --> 00:51:37,181
I know. That's why I'm giving you
the Alvin guarantee

775
00:51:37,431 --> 00:51:40,017
that I will be at that
sing- off Friday night.

776
00:51:40,142 --> 00:51:42,394
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Why wouldn't you be there?

777
00:51:43,270 --> 00:51:46,732
Because I have a...

778
00:51:47,608 --> 00:51:49,902
- What?
- A...

779
00:51:50,235 --> 00:51:52,279
- You have a what?
- A football game!

780
00:51:52,404 --> 00:51:54,948
There! I said it! A football game!

781
00:52:01,955 --> 00:52:05,250
Simon? Alvin? Is everything all right?

782
00:52:06,293 --> 00:52:09,338
Theodore! Yeah, we're fine.

783
00:52:09,463 --> 00:52:12,049
Just a little dumpster wrestling.

784
00:52:12,174 --> 00:52:13,592
Crazy in here.

785
00:52:14,885 --> 00:52:16,011
Right.

786
00:52:18,305 --> 00:52:21,308
Don't worry, Theo!
Everything is going to be fine.

787
00:52:21,433 --> 00:52:23,894
Alvin, do not miss that sing- off.

788
00:52:24,645 --> 00:52:27,105
Don't worry, Simon. I'll be there.

789
00:52:27,898 --> 00:52:29,399
I can do both.

790
00:52:29,817 --> 00:52:32,820
Hey, guys, thanks so much
for helping out today.

791
00:52:32,945 --> 00:52:35,280
Toys for Tots is a really cool organization.

792
00:52:35,405 --> 00:52:38,200
So, everybody's getting cool points today.

793
00:52:39,993 --> 00:52:42,579
- What's going on with Theodore?
- I have no idea.

794
00:52:48,126 --> 00:52:51,046
Hey, Eleanor, why don't you see
if Theodore needs some help?

795
00:52:54,049 --> 00:52:55,425
Well, okay.

796
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:12,609
They don't look very comfortable.

797
00:53:14,361 --> 00:53:16,321
My shoes? They're not.

798
00:53:16,446 --> 00:53:19,825
But Ian says
that I need to work on being taller.

799
00:53:21,326 --> 00:53:24,496
Well, I think you look great
just the way you are.

800
00:53:26,039 --> 00:53:27,207
You do?

801
00:53:37,134 --> 00:53:39,761
Hi, you've reached Dave Seville.
Please leave a message.

802
00:53:40,554 --> 00:53:44,892
Hi. Toby? This is Julie Ortega.
We talked yesterday.

803
00:53:45,017 --> 00:53:46,727
Well, we kind of, sort of did.

804
00:53:46,852 --> 00:53:51,356
Anyway, the reason I'm calling
is that I'm worried about Theodore.

805
00:53:52,232 --> 00:53:54,193
He's been acting a little down lately.

806
00:53:55,986 --> 00:53:58,155
I hope you're going to the sing- off Friday.

807
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:01,492
You know, with his dad gone, Theodore
needs all the support he can get.

808
00:54:01,617 --> 00:54:06,830
So, I'll see you there.
I hope we get a chance to talk. Bye.

809
00:54:15,339 --> 00:54:18,967
Okay, folks. Time to
get behind your undefeated Warriors.

810
00:54:19,092 --> 00:54:23,096
The visiting Eagles are down by 5
with about 30 seconds left in the game.

811
00:54:23,222 --> 00:54:25,557
- Time is running out for the Eagles.
- Go, Eagles!

812
00:54:25,682 --> 00:54:28,185
Quarterback Ryan Edwards
really needs to make a move here

813
00:54:28,310 --> 00:54:29,686
or this game is over.

814
00:54:30,103 --> 00:54:32,898
I know they're gonna put me in.
They've gotta put me in!

815
00:54:37,277 --> 00:54:38,904
Time out! Time out!

816
00:54:39,029 --> 00:54:43,450
Time out, Eagles. 4th and 15
with 9 seconds remaining in the game.

817
00:54:48,413 --> 00:54:49,832
Substitution, Eagles.

818
00:54:50,499 --> 00:54:52,543
All right, boys. It's time for the big A.

819
00:54:52,668 --> 00:54:55,254
I'm gonna crush them.
I'm bringing the pain!

820
00:54:55,379 --> 00:54:58,340
- The Alvinator is in the house!
- Are you sure about this?

821
00:54:58,465 --> 00:55:00,968
4th and 10, Xan.
We need to go with the secret weapon.

822
00:55:01,468 --> 00:55:05,681
Trips right, Alpha left, motion on me.
Time to make history, boys.

823
00:55:05,806 --> 00:55:07,307
- Ready!
- Break!

824
00:55:08,308 --> 00:55:09,726
Defense!

825
00:55:14,982 --> 00:55:18,652
- This ain't no dance, baby!
- I'm taking you down, Jennifer!

826
00:55:19,111 --> 00:55:21,155
You're the one going down, rat face.

827
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:24,700
I'm gonna crack you like an acorn
and eat you for dinner,

828
00:55:24,825 --> 00:55:27,494
with some fava beans and a nice Chianti.

829
00:55:29,163 --> 00:55:30,455
Is he talking about my father?

830
00:55:30,581 --> 00:55:35,127
A- 42! A- 42!

831
00:55:36,295 --> 00:55:37,337
Hut!

832
00:55:45,179 --> 00:55:47,264
Incoming!

833
00:55:54,313 --> 00:55:56,064
- Yeah!
- Touchdown, Eagles!

834
00:55:56,190 --> 00:55:58,984
Oh, yeah. Come on!
That's what I'm talking about.

835
00:55:59,109 --> 00:56:00,694
Don't hate the player, hate the game.

836
00:56:00,819 --> 00:56:02,196
And I love how awesome I am.

837
00:56:03,405 --> 00:56:06,992
Final score, Eagles 15, Warriors 14.

838
00:56:07,117 --> 00:56:10,454
What do you think about that,
suckers? Oh, yeah!

839
00:56:10,579 --> 00:56:13,540
In your faces!
That's what I'm talking about.

840
00:56:13,665 --> 00:56:15,501
You're like the Randy Moss of chipmunks.

841
00:56:15,626 --> 00:56:18,253
Yeah! Give me an "A". Give me an "L".

842
00:56:18,378 --> 00:56:20,380
Give me a "V". Give me an "I".
Give me an "N".

843
00:56:20,506 --> 00:56:23,967
- What does that spell? Awesome!
- Way to go, Alvin!

844
00:56:24,092 --> 00:56:27,095
- I'm the king of the world!
- Party with the MVP!

845
00:56:27,221 --> 00:56:29,389
- Oh, yeah!
- Party with Alvin!

846
00:56:29,515 --> 00:56:31,892
- You got that right.
- Everybody to the beach house!

847
00:56:32,059 --> 00:56:33,393
Let's do it!

848
00:56:33,894 --> 00:56:35,354
Alvin! Alvin!

849
00:56:35,479 --> 00:56:36,563
Alvin! Alvin!

850
00:56:37,773 --> 00:56:38,899
Chipmunks! Chipmunks!

851
00:56:39,024 --> 00:56:40,776
Chipettes! Chipettes!

852
00:56:40,901 --> 00:56:44,696
So, look, guys, I just want you to know
that I'm here for you.

853
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:47,574
There's plenty of time.
I'm gonna go find Alvin,

854
00:56:47,699 --> 00:56:49,493
everything's gonna work out.

855
00:56:49,785 --> 00:56:51,245
Thanks, Toby.

856
00:56:51,411 --> 00:56:54,581
Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Rubin.

857
00:56:56,166 --> 00:56:58,460
Thank you, students. Thank you.

858
00:56:58,961 --> 00:57:01,880
Welcome to our exciting
sing- off competition

859
00:57:02,005 --> 00:57:04,550
between the Chipmunks and the Chipettes.

860
00:57:09,888 --> 00:57:13,392
Now, remember, students,
there are no winners or losers.

861
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:16,562
Yeah, remind me to tell the Chipmunks
that when we blow them off the stage.

862
00:57:16,687 --> 00:57:20,065
The group that we choose today will give
our school a chance to win $25,000

863
00:57:20,190 --> 00:57:22,067
to save our music department.

864
00:57:22,192 --> 00:57:25,863
So, without further ado,
I give you the Chipettes!

865
00:57:28,615 --> 00:57:31,243
This is it, girls. Can you believe it?

866
00:57:32,035 --> 00:57:36,248
Brittany, your time to shine, baby.
Go out there and knock them dead.

867
00:57:36,373 --> 00:57:38,208
Yes, sir! I can do it!

868
00:57:39,626 --> 00:57:43,672
You two, I just want to let you know
not to get in Brittany's way.

869
00:57:45,591 --> 00:57:46,592
Okay.

870
00:58:30,802 --> 00:58:36,642
Like what you see? Call Ian Hawke.
310- 555- 5309.

871
00:58:39,269 --> 00:58:42,981
Don't worry, Simon. Alvin will walk
through that door any minute now.

872
00:58:43,482 --> 00:58:44,608
Alvin!

873
00:58:49,154 --> 00:58:50,781
I am back!

874
00:59:00,749 --> 00:59:03,502
- Girls, that's for us.
- Thank you so much.

875
00:59:03,627 --> 00:59:05,254
Thank you. Thank you.

876
00:59:06,463 --> 00:59:08,757
Well done, ladies. And now,

877
00:59:09,299 --> 00:59:13,679
let's hear it for a group
that will rock you like a hurricane.

878
00:59:13,971 --> 00:59:17,474
At least that's what
many of you students have told me.

879
00:59:17,724 --> 00:59:19,852
Here they are, the Chipmunks!

880
00:59:21,728 --> 00:59:26,066
Hey, you know they say there's no "I"
in the word "team," and they're right.

881
00:59:26,191 --> 00:59:29,194
But you know what there is an "I" in?
"Alvin."

882
00:59:31,405 --> 00:59:33,365
Sucks to be you. Girls!

883
00:59:34,616 --> 00:59:36,410
Sadly, he's correct.

884
00:59:37,578 --> 00:59:39,538
- Did you find him?
- Guys.

885
00:59:39,872 --> 00:59:42,207
Sorry, I searched the whole perimeter.

886
00:59:42,332 --> 00:59:44,793
And I don't know why,
but the team's not back yet.

887
00:59:44,918 --> 00:59:46,837
Well, what should we do?

888
00:59:49,173 --> 00:59:50,465
I would...

889
00:59:51,592 --> 00:59:54,803
I would ask someone who's not me.

890
00:59:57,264 --> 00:59:58,682
I know what we should do.

891
00:59:58,932 --> 01:00:00,517
Chipmunks! Chipmunks!

892
01:00:01,059 --> 01:00:03,187
Chipmunks! Chipmunks!

893
01:00:11,445 --> 01:00:12,905
Hi, everyone.

894
01:00:15,782 --> 01:00:18,827
Our brother Alvin couldn't be here today.

895
01:00:20,621 --> 01:00:24,291
The thing is,
we've never performed without Alvin.

896
01:00:24,416 --> 01:00:27,920
And we're not starting now.

897
01:00:29,755 --> 01:00:32,049
You can't have only 2 little pigs.

898
01:00:32,174 --> 01:00:34,593
You can't have only 2 musketeers.

899
01:00:34,718 --> 01:00:37,721
So, you know you can't
have only 2 Chipmunks.

900
01:00:39,473 --> 01:00:40,807
Thank you.

901
01:00:52,152 --> 01:00:53,821
I'll take you home.

902
01:01:05,707 --> 01:01:10,546
Hear that, girls?
That is the sound of success.

903
01:01:13,966 --> 01:01:19,096
I realize how devastated
you Chipmunk fans must be.

904
01:01:22,683 --> 01:01:25,018
So, I guess that means that the Chipettes

905
01:01:25,144 --> 01:01:26,520
- will be representing West Eastman...
- Come on, girls.

906
01:01:26,645 --> 01:01:28,272
Let's take a victory lap.

907
01:01:29,815 --> 01:01:31,775
Hey, come on, guys. Let's go.

908
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:35,112
- Brit, we have to.
- Let's go.

909
01:01:37,364 --> 01:01:39,950
Yeah! Let them know!

910
01:01:40,659 --> 01:01:42,286
Thank you. Thanks.

911
01:01:51,587 --> 01:01:53,046
Life is good.

912
01:01:53,672 --> 01:01:56,133
Especially when you're not a loser.

913
01:01:57,467 --> 01:01:59,178
Hey, guys! I'm here!

914
01:02:01,513 --> 01:02:02,598
Guys?

915
01:02:03,515 --> 01:02:04,641
Great.

916
01:02:05,017 --> 01:02:06,768
They're gone, Alvin.

917
01:02:07,561 --> 01:02:09,480
They're never gonna forgive me.

918
01:02:10,189 --> 01:02:12,983
You know, Alvin, Ian was right.

919
01:02:13,108 --> 01:02:15,319
You don't care about anyone but yourself.

920
01:02:20,949 --> 01:02:24,244
And by the way,
I never wanted to win this way.

921
01:02:37,257 --> 01:02:39,593
Simon? Theodore?

922
01:02:42,763 --> 01:02:44,556
Simon, are you awake?

923
01:02:53,565 --> 01:02:54,650
Theo?

924
01:02:55,901 --> 01:02:57,027
Theo!

925
01:03:12,459 --> 01:03:14,253
Theodore? Theodore?

926
01:03:15,087 --> 01:03:18,048
Theodore, I don't blame you
for being mad...

927
01:03:20,717 --> 01:03:22,594
"I ran away from home.

928
01:03:23,136 --> 01:03:25,931
"Don't look for me at the zoo,
'cause I'm not there."

929
01:03:26,056 --> 01:03:27,641
Oh, no, Theodore.

930
01:03:34,773 --> 01:03:37,568
Hello? Meerkat family?

931
01:03:40,779 --> 01:03:42,156
Oh, brother.

932
01:03:46,034 --> 01:03:47,578
Is anyone home?

933
01:03:48,203 --> 01:03:51,456
My name is Theodore.
I'd like to be in your family.

934
01:03:59,339 --> 01:04:00,924
Maybe they're hiding.

935
01:04:01,049 --> 01:04:02,426
Don't be afraid!

936
01:04:08,307 --> 01:04:11,435
You are not a meerkat.

937
01:04:12,811 --> 01:04:15,522
Toby, you take the lions,
the tigers and the bears.

938
01:04:15,647 --> 01:04:17,608
Simon and I will take the butterfly room.

939
01:04:18,984 --> 01:04:20,360
Nice eagle.

940
01:04:21,528 --> 01:04:23,530
- Theo!
- Don't move, Theodore!

941
01:04:24,156 --> 01:04:25,741
No problem there.

942
01:04:26,158 --> 01:04:27,743
Hang in there! Hang in there, little guy!

943
01:04:27,868 --> 01:04:29,786
We're gonna get you out of there!

944
01:04:31,413 --> 01:04:34,917
Okay, okay, we need a plan.
We need a carefully executed plan.

945
01:04:35,667 --> 01:04:38,545
Or you could just run in there
like a maniac.

946
01:04:40,214 --> 01:04:43,383
- Theo, watch out!
- Hi, I'm Theodore.

947
01:04:46,053 --> 01:04:48,680
Hey, birdie! Over here! Are you hungry?

948
01:04:48,805 --> 01:04:51,099
'Cause this "A" stands for "appetizer"!

949
01:04:54,436 --> 01:04:58,148
Let's all just relax
and we'll talk this out. Okay?

950
01:04:58,315 --> 01:05:03,153
Look, I get why you want Theodore. I do.

951
01:05:04,029 --> 01:05:06,698
But, I'm sorry, I can't let that happen.

952
01:05:07,991 --> 01:05:10,953
He's my brother. Not that he'd know that,

953
01:05:11,078 --> 01:05:14,164
because I've been such a big jerk lately.

954
01:05:17,334 --> 01:05:20,170
If anyone deserves to be eaten, it's me.

955
01:05:23,549 --> 01:05:25,092
Not literally!

956
01:05:25,217 --> 01:05:26,677
I got you, Alvin!

957
01:05:28,095 --> 01:05:29,304
Move it!

958
01:05:30,264 --> 01:05:31,682
- Theo.
- Help!

959
01:05:32,224 --> 01:05:34,268
Guys, it's a wedge- tail eagle.

960
01:05:34,393 --> 01:05:36,603
Their only mortal enemy
is the pygmy elephant.

961
01:05:36,728 --> 01:05:38,730
Luckily, I speak a little pachyderm.

962
01:05:43,902 --> 01:05:45,279
I think it's working!

963
01:05:47,114 --> 01:05:48,282
Or not!

964
01:05:55,622 --> 01:05:57,040
Guys, that was huge.

965
01:05:58,250 --> 01:05:59,626
He's right.

966
01:06:00,085 --> 01:06:03,255
So, are we back to 1 for all
and 3 for 1?

967
01:06:03,755 --> 01:06:05,841
Come on, Simon. Hug it out.

968
01:06:07,092 --> 01:06:08,927
You know I'm sorry, Si.

969
01:06:10,554 --> 01:06:13,474
Si? Don't make me have to kiss you!

970
01:06:13,599 --> 01:06:15,642
Because I'll do it. I don't care.

971
01:06:16,977 --> 01:06:20,647
Here come the lips.
Make- out train is leaving the station.

972
01:06:23,609 --> 01:06:27,279
- Think I'll take that hug.
- Guys.

973
01:06:35,704 --> 01:06:41,418
Interested? Call Ian Hawke.
310- 555- 5309.

974
01:06:41,877 --> 01:06:44,755
Deloris, get me that
Ian Hawke on the phone.

975
01:06:50,135 --> 01:06:51,512
- There you are...
- Hi.

976
01:06:51,637 --> 01:06:54,348
my sweet little moneymakers.

977
01:06:55,557 --> 01:06:59,353
Do you remember when I told you
that I would make you all big stars?

978
01:06:59,478 --> 01:07:01,146
- Yeah.
- Well,

979
01:07:01,647 --> 01:07:04,608
guess who's opening up for Britney
Spears at the Staples Center tonight?

980
01:07:05,734 --> 01:07:08,070
- Yeah!
- Pinch me. Am I dreaming? Oh, my gosh.

981
01:07:08,195 --> 01:07:11,073
Wait, tonight?
We'll miss the school contest.

982
01:07:11,573 --> 01:07:14,284
That is correct.
You will miss the school contest.

983
01:07:14,409 --> 01:07:16,870
You're so smart.
I can never get anything past you.

984
01:07:16,995 --> 01:07:19,623
It was never about
that stupid school contest.

985
01:07:19,748 --> 01:07:23,961
It was always about
making Brittany a star.

986
01:07:24,878 --> 01:07:26,922
That's what you wanted, right?

987
01:07:28,215 --> 01:07:31,718
- Well, yeah.
- Well, tonight's your big chance.

988
01:07:32,344 --> 01:07:34,012
It's all about you, Brittany.

989
01:07:34,137 --> 01:07:36,390
What about Jeanette and Eleanor?

990
01:07:36,515 --> 01:07:39,393
Yeah, well, they can sing backup.
I got them some stuff, too.

991
01:07:39,685 --> 01:07:40,769
Hey!

992
01:07:41,228 --> 01:07:43,480
But we're her sisters.

993
01:07:43,856 --> 01:07:46,984
And the 3 of us sing together
or not at all.

994
01:07:47,901 --> 01:07:50,779
Okay, fine. All I really need is the B- girl.

995
01:07:52,948 --> 01:07:55,284
Ian, I won't do it without them.

996
01:07:57,619 --> 01:08:00,747
Okay. Fine, fine. Let's move on to plan B.

997
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:04,960
- Okay! Who likes barbecue?
- Barbecue?

998
01:08:05,085 --> 01:08:08,338
Because I know this awesome little
barbecue restaurant in the Valley

999
01:08:08,463 --> 01:08:10,424
that makes the best roasted chipmunk.

1000
01:08:11,884 --> 01:08:13,844
Real tasty.

1001
01:08:13,969 --> 01:08:16,388
Unless, of course, you wanna sing.

1002
01:08:24,730 --> 01:08:29,776
Welcome to West Eastman, and thank you
for supporting music in our schools.

1003
01:08:30,068 --> 01:08:32,321
Now, remember,
the group you pick tonight

1004
01:08:32,446 --> 01:08:35,240
will win $25,000 for their school!

1005
01:08:37,159 --> 01:08:40,829
Now, we've got a lot of acts,
and we have to turn the heat off at 9:30,

1006
01:08:40,954 --> 01:08:44,500
so without any further ado,
representing Orange Grove,

1007
01:08:44,625 --> 01:08:48,128
put your hands together for Li'l Rosero!

1008
01:09:13,445 --> 01:09:15,364
So, we meet again.

1009
01:09:16,281 --> 01:09:18,951
What? You want a piece of this, eagle?

1010
01:09:23,956 --> 01:09:26,208
- Ian Hawke?
- I'll take that.

1011
01:09:28,085 --> 01:09:31,380
I didn't realize
I pocket- dialed 1- 800- LOWLIFE.

1012
01:09:31,505 --> 01:09:33,257
- Alvin?
- Brittany?

1013
01:09:33,382 --> 01:09:36,093
Yeah, could you guys fill in for us?

1014
01:09:36,635 --> 01:09:38,595
We're not gonna be able
to perform tonight.

1015
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:42,015
What about the music department?
The whole school is counting on you.

1016
01:09:42,141 --> 01:09:45,435
I know. I know.
I should have listened to you about Ian.

1017
01:09:45,561 --> 01:09:49,356
- Don't tell me!
- Yep. He locked us in a cage.

1018
01:09:49,648 --> 01:09:51,233
What? This is the biggest you have?

1019
01:09:51,358 --> 01:09:53,110
I had my assistant call
and ask for the biggest limo.

1020
01:09:53,235 --> 01:09:54,570
This is not the biggest limo you have.

1021
01:09:54,695 --> 01:09:56,613
I'll go break the news to Dr. Rubin.

1022
01:09:58,031 --> 01:10:00,033
- Brittany?
- Alvin, don't move!

1023
01:10:00,159 --> 01:10:01,618
You got it!

1024
01:10:01,743 --> 01:10:05,372
Brittany, I'm coming to get you.
Simon, tell Jeanette how to pick the lock.

1025
01:10:05,497 --> 01:10:06,540
Roger that!

1026
01:10:06,707 --> 01:10:09,459
Oh, man. I need to get to the girls, fast!

1027
01:10:10,335 --> 01:10:11,670
I know how!

1028
01:10:24,808 --> 01:10:29,438
Jeanette, focus. The 3rd number is
notoriously the hardest to crack.

1029
01:10:29,563 --> 01:10:31,732
I'm assuming it's a prime number,
but we can't assume...

1030
01:10:31,857 --> 01:10:36,153
Simon! The first 2 numbers were ones.
I got to go with one.

1031
01:10:36,278 --> 01:10:37,821
- It opened!
- All right, girls.

1032
01:10:37,946 --> 01:10:40,115
Ian's coming.
Put the phone back. Hurry!

1033
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:43,494
- Get ready to be fabulous.
- We're ready.

1034
01:10:43,619 --> 01:10:44,745
Yeah, you better be.

1035
01:10:44,870 --> 01:10:48,165
Because tonight's performance is
going to put me back on top.

1036
01:10:56,131 --> 01:10:59,009
Next up, please welcome Charice!

1037
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:20,864
Driver- man, take me to the arena.
VIP entrance.

1038
01:11:23,158 --> 01:11:26,912
How about a little moon roof action?
Moon roofs are go!

1039
01:11:27,246 --> 01:11:29,164
Rooves? Moon roof.
Roofs? Rooves?

1040
01:11:29,748 --> 01:11:33,669
Champagne. Don't mind if I do.

1041
01:11:34,628 --> 01:11:36,588
You know why I don't mind if I do?

1042
01:11:36,713 --> 01:11:42,594
Because tonight, we've got to toast
to a very special someone

1043
01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:44,138
named me.

1044
01:11:45,055 --> 01:11:48,767
They said I couldn't do it.
They said I'd never bounce back.

1045
01:11:49,393 --> 01:11:52,646
Guess what? Time to kiss my sweet...

1046
01:11:53,272 --> 01:11:54,523
Oh, yeah.

1047
01:11:55,399 --> 01:12:00,529
A toast to the ladies who're gonna make
the world forget about the Chip...

1048
01:12:03,365 --> 01:12:05,325
- What...
- See you!

1049
01:12:05,868 --> 01:12:07,578
No. No, no, no! No!

1050
01:12:08,078 --> 01:12:10,205
What are you doing? Alvin!

1051
01:12:10,914 --> 01:12:13,876
Hi, Ian! Good to see you!
You never write!

1052
01:12:15,294 --> 01:12:16,920
- No! Brittany... No!
- Come on, girls!

1053
01:12:17,045 --> 01:12:19,047
I signed a contract!

1054
01:12:19,339 --> 01:12:20,716
- Jump, Jeanette!
- Wait!

1055
01:12:20,883 --> 01:12:23,010
- I'm not really good at...
- I got you.

1056
01:12:23,135 --> 01:12:24,887
I'm dead if you don't perform!

1057
01:12:25,012 --> 01:12:26,555
- Punch it, Alvin!
- You got it!

1058
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:28,390
- No! Don't!
- Hey, Ian!

1059
01:12:28,515 --> 01:12:30,851
In the words of the Donald,
"You're fired! "

1060
01:12:30,976 --> 01:12:32,227
Alvin!

1061
01:12:42,196 --> 01:12:45,824
Hey! Hey. Hey, guys.
Any sign of Alvin yet? Huh?

1062
01:12:45,949 --> 01:12:48,035
No. No Alvin, and no Chipettes.

1063
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:52,039
Just Dr. Rubin and, you know,
the entire school counting on us.

1064
01:12:52,789 --> 01:12:56,960
Well... Yeah, you know, don't worry.

1065
01:12:57,961 --> 01:13:00,464
Everything will work out- ish.

1066
01:13:08,806 --> 01:13:10,432
- Faster, Alvin!
- Don't worry.

1067
01:13:10,557 --> 01:13:13,101
I'm gonna get a little help
from my friend Digger!

1068
01:13:14,144 --> 01:13:15,687
- Roger that, Alvin!
- Look out!

1069
01:13:16,438 --> 01:13:18,273
Feels like I'm back at the race track.

1070
01:13:19,066 --> 01:13:21,944
- Hey! Careful!
- Keep going! What are you doing?

1071
01:13:23,111 --> 01:13:24,112
Yeah.

1072
01:13:24,238 --> 01:13:27,866
Wait till I tell everybody back home
I saved Alvin Seville.

1073
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:30,494
I guess I owe you an apology about Ian.

1074
01:13:30,619 --> 01:13:33,121
Stick with me, Brit.
I'll never steer you wrong.

1075
01:13:34,623 --> 01:13:36,875
Oh, yeah. I'll never doubt you again.

1076
01:13:40,671 --> 01:13:43,131
I gotta say, he is definitely persistent.

1077
01:13:46,552 --> 01:13:48,887
- We have got to lose him.
- Hang on!

1078
01:13:50,556 --> 01:13:53,600
I've got a plan.
Jump on the count of 3.

1079
01:13:53,725 --> 01:13:54,852
3!

1080
01:13:55,352 --> 01:13:56,645
That's it.

1081
01:13:56,770 --> 01:13:58,480
I'm not really good with heights.

1082
01:13:58,605 --> 01:14:00,482
Just hang on tight, Jeanette.

1083
01:14:00,607 --> 01:14:02,359
Bring my girls right to me.

1084
01:14:02,484 --> 01:14:05,863
- We need the remote.
- Guys, I know what to do.

1085
01:14:05,988 --> 01:14:07,865
It's hats off to Ian.

1086
01:14:14,705 --> 01:14:16,081
The remote!

1087
01:14:17,249 --> 01:14:19,168
I can't reach it!

1088
01:14:19,293 --> 01:14:21,211
I'm going for it. Grab my ankles.

1089
01:14:25,591 --> 01:14:26,842
I got it!

1090
01:14:27,968 --> 01:14:29,219
I got it.

1091
01:14:30,846 --> 01:14:33,015
- Way to go, Jen!
- Nice work, Jeanette!

1092
01:14:33,140 --> 01:14:38,020
Good going, Jen! Hey, Ian,
you were wrong. I don't need these!

1093
01:14:46,069 --> 01:14:48,739
- My bad!
- Adiós, Ian!

1094
01:14:50,073 --> 01:14:52,784
And now for our final act of the night.

1095
01:14:52,910 --> 01:14:55,329
Now, listen, we've had
a last- second change to the line- up,

1096
01:14:55,454 --> 01:14:57,873
but we don't think
you're gonna be too disappointed.

1097
01:14:57,998 --> 01:15:01,877
Representing West Eastman,
it's the Chipmunks!

1098
01:15:06,048 --> 01:15:08,675
We may have to go out there, Theodore.

1099
01:15:11,094 --> 01:15:12,513
Chipmunks! Chipmunks!

1100
01:15:12,763 --> 01:15:14,097
Chipmunks! Chipmunks!

1101
01:15:14,431 --> 01:15:15,557
Chipmunks!

1102
01:15:15,599 --> 01:15:19,561
Well, if there are no Chipmunks,
we're gonna have to move on. So now...

1103
01:15:22,648 --> 01:15:24,817
I don't wanna be booed again.

1104
01:15:26,276 --> 01:15:28,237
I'm sorry. We're gonna have to move on.

1105
01:15:28,987 --> 01:15:31,615
Hi! Hi! Hi! Hi! I...

1106
01:15:35,619 --> 01:15:37,746
I'm not a Chipmunk, as you can see.

1107
01:15:45,212 --> 01:15:47,256
Play some music, you loser!

1108
01:15:47,381 --> 01:15:49,132
- Play some music!
- Yeah!

1109
01:15:50,133 --> 01:15:51,677
- More music!
- Play some music!

1110
01:15:51,802 --> 01:15:52,970
Okay, okay.

1111
01:15:53,095 --> 01:15:56,223
Okay, okay, I got a song.
I got a song, I got a song.

1112
01:16:03,856 --> 01:16:06,024
<i>* Ever since I met you</i>

1113
01:16:07,192 --> 01:16:09,111
<i>* I wanted to be your guy</i>

1114
01:16:11,947 --> 01:16:14,283
<i>* But as you've probably noticed</i>

1115
01:16:16,118 --> 01:16:18,537
<i>* I'm pathologically shy</i>

1116
01:16:19,204 --> 01:16:22,958
<i>* And standing on this stage right now
I think I'd rather die</i>

1117
01:16:23,083 --> 01:16:26,879
<i>* So I'm just gonna start by saying</i>

1118
01:16:29,089 --> 01:16:30,465
<i>Hi</i>

1119
01:16:31,466 --> 01:16:32,467
Hi.

1120
01:16:35,762 --> 01:16:37,681
Now, that was huge.

1121
01:16:41,935 --> 01:16:45,314
Thank you. Thank you.
No, really. Thank you.

1122
01:16:45,606 --> 01:16:48,775
- What the...
- The Chipettes are in the building!

1123
01:16:49,860 --> 01:16:52,446
- It's the Chipettes!
- Alvin!

1124
01:16:54,364 --> 01:16:58,327
- Theo!
- Hello, West Eastman!

1125
01:16:59,870 --> 01:17:02,664
I'm putting her down! Hang on!

1126
01:17:02,789 --> 01:17:04,583
- Alvin!
- Double high- five, brother.

1127
01:17:05,501 --> 01:17:07,586
High- five!

1128
01:17:08,587 --> 01:17:11,840
Ladies and gentlemen,
representing West Eastman,

1129
01:17:11,965 --> 01:17:14,009
it is my great pleasure...

1130
01:17:14,134 --> 01:17:15,969
This is such an honor.

1131
01:17:16,553 --> 01:17:18,013
For you or for us?

1132
01:17:18,138 --> 01:17:19,181
- For us.
- For us.

1133
01:17:19,306 --> 01:17:20,808
Jinx! Double- jinx! Triple- jinx!

1134
01:17:20,933 --> 01:17:22,309
Quadruple- jinx! Infinity- jinx!

1135
01:17:22,434 --> 01:17:23,852
Guys! We get it.

1136
01:17:23,977 --> 01:17:26,772
- Huddle up, gang.
- Okay, here's the plan.

1137
01:17:26,897 --> 01:17:30,067
I give you the Chipettes
and the Chipmunks!

1138
01:18:14,444 --> 01:18:15,779
- Dave!
- Dave!

1139
01:18:54,776 --> 01:18:56,904
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1140
01:18:57,029 --> 01:18:58,864
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1141
01:18:58,989 --> 01:19:04,703
Hey, everybody. It's clear
that we have a winner of the $25,000!

1142
01:19:04,828 --> 01:19:07,873
And it's West Eastman High!
West Eastman High!

1143
01:19:07,998 --> 01:19:09,333
- Guys, we did it!
- Yeah!

1144
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:10,792
- Wow!
- Can you believe it?

1145
01:19:12,002 --> 01:19:13,795
A little something
for the music department.

1146
01:19:16,381 --> 01:19:17,674
All right!

1147
01:19:18,884 --> 01:19:20,803
Right back at you, Dr. Rubes!

1148
01:19:22,262 --> 01:19:23,388
Oh, yeah!

1149
01:19:24,014 --> 01:19:25,349
- Chipettes! Chipettes!
- Chipettes! Chipettes!

1150
01:19:25,474 --> 01:19:27,351
Ladies and gentlemen,

1151
01:19:27,476 --> 01:19:32,981
the Staples Center is proud
to welcome the Chipettes!

1152
01:19:34,817 --> 01:19:39,613
Hi, everyone.
I'm Jeanette. And I'm Eleanor.

1153
01:19:40,113 --> 01:19:41,740
And I'm Brittany!

1154
01:19:42,366 --> 01:19:44,660
And we're the Chipettes!

1155
01:19:44,785 --> 01:19:46,495
- What?
- What is that?

1156
01:19:48,163 --> 01:19:49,748
1, 2, 3.

1157
01:19:53,752 --> 01:19:54,878
That's not the Chipettes!

1158
01:20:01,927 --> 01:20:04,429
- Come on, lady.
- I know, I know. All right, I'm sorry.

1159
01:20:04,555 --> 01:20:07,099
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I know, I'm sorry!

1160
01:20:07,224 --> 01:20:08,392
I'm going!

1161
01:20:18,819 --> 01:20:21,446
- Dave! You're dancing!
- You're moving good, Dave!

1162
01:20:21,572 --> 01:20:22,906
- Yeah!
- Welcome home.

1163
01:20:23,031 --> 01:20:25,200
So, did you miss us?

1164
01:20:25,325 --> 01:20:28,579
- Of course I missed you. You're my boys.
- Cool!

1165
01:20:28,704 --> 01:20:32,082
And, Dave, just think how much
you'd miss us if there were 6 of us.

1166
01:20:32,207 --> 01:20:33,375
Alvin, what did you say?

1167
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:36,753
Well, the Chipettes needed
a place to crash, right?

1168
01:20:36,879 --> 01:20:39,006
So, I said that you said

1169
01:20:39,131 --> 01:20:42,259
they could stay with us
for as long as they needed to.

1170
01:20:42,384 --> 01:20:46,138
- Alvin!
- Okay! This one's for Dave.

1171
01:20:46,263 --> 01:20:48,974
Everybody,
shake what your mamma gave you!

1172
01:20:51,727 --> 01:20:57,774
Subtitles: Arigon

1173
01:21:26,178 --> 01:21:29,097
Look at you. All ready for bed.

1174
01:21:30,724 --> 01:21:33,018
Looks like the Chipettes
are a good influence.

1175
01:21:33,143 --> 01:21:34,394
- Thanks, Dave.
- Thanks, Dave.

1176
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:35,771
Thanks, Dave.

1177
01:21:36,188 --> 01:21:39,274
Okay, guys. Now lights out.
Good night, everybody.

1178
01:21:39,399 --> 01:21:40,526
- Good night, Jeanette.
- Good night, Simon.

1179
01:21:40,651 --> 01:21:42,069
Good night, Dave. Good night, Alvin.

1180
01:21:43,278 --> 01:21:45,322
- Alvin?
- I'm not tired.

1181
01:21:45,447 --> 01:21:47,491
Sorry, but you've got school tomorrow.

1182
01:21:50,244 --> 01:21:51,578
Not tired.

1183
01:21:53,580 --> 01:21:55,624
Alvin, come on. It's time for bed.

1184
01:21:57,417 --> 01:22:00,254
- Not tired.
- Alvin?

1185
01:22:03,048 --> 01:22:06,135
Still not tired. More awake. Tired.

1186
01:22:06,260 --> 01:22:08,554
- Just kidding. Much more awake.
- Alvin, that's it.

1187
01:22:08,679 --> 01:22:11,014
- Don't make me come over there.
- Okay.

1188
01:22:16,300 --> 01:22:18,469
Boy! I suddenly got really, really tired.

1189
01:22:19,094 --> 01:22:20,137
Night, Dave.

1190
01:22:20,262 --> 01:22:22,431
Alvin!

1191
01:23:40,634 --> 01:23:45,264
Good start, gentlemen. Only 10 more
rows of bleachers to go. Let's do it.

1192
01:28:18,662 --> 01:28:20,581
All right, guys.
All right. All right.

1193
01:28:20,706 --> 01:28:23,292
All right, I'm out. I'm out.
Is this necessary?

1194
01:28:23,417 --> 01:28:26,420
Come on. Is that necessary?
Is that...

1195
01:28:26,921 --> 01:28:29,673
At least let me go back and get my purse.

1196
