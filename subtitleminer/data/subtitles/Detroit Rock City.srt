1
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:03,021
We've only just begun

2
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:08,527
Before the rising sun

3
00:01:11,113 --> 00:01:14,449
We've only just begun

4
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:17,327
Day by day

5
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:19,788
Together

6
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:23,083
Oh, and together

7
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:24,626
Just the two of us

8
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:47,524
What is that?

9
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,199
Oh, come on!

10
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,668
Shut up!

11
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,153
Kiss!

12
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:35,364
The devil's music.

13
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:41,286
You say you wanna go for a spin

14
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:44,665
The party's just begun,
we'll let you in

15
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,834
You drive us wild

16
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:49,294
We'll drive you crazy

17
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:53,298
You keep on shouting

18
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,344
I can't fucking hear you!

19
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,141
I wanna rock and roll all night

20
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:06,061
And party every day

21
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:23,787
You keep on shouting

22
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:26,748
What?

23
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,667
Give it to me, baby!

24
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:33,213
I wanna rock and roll all night

25
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:34,631
Let's party

26
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,300
And party every day

27
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,302
I wanna rock

28
00:03:38,302 --> 00:03:40,095
I wanna rock until I die

29
00:04:00,032 --> 00:04:02,784
Thank you, Cleveland!

30
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:04,244
You've been great...

31
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:07,998
but after three and a half hours
of kick-ass rock and roll...

32
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,125
and seven encores
on top of that...

33
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:13,212
I'm sorry to say we gotta
get back to our hotel rooms...

34
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:16,131
and fuck some groupies, so...

35
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,221
What are you doing, man?

36
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,181
Fuckin' asshole, man.

37
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:25,599
That's my bass.

38
00:04:25,641 --> 00:04:28,560
Just one more day of school
to get through, girls...

39
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:29,728
before tomorrow night.

40
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:35,192
Come on, all Detroit, Michigan,
you wanted the best!

41
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:37,194
You got the best!

42
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:40,197
The hottest band in the world!

43
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:41,823
Kiss!

44
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,749
Who is it?

45
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,293
Shit, man!
It's Jam's mom.

46
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:55,504
What?
It's my mom?

47
00:04:55,546 --> 00:04:56,755
Cover this shit up.

48
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:58,590
Spray something.
It smells like dope.

49
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:01,510
Just like Jam's mom
to ruin the fucking party.

50
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:03,762
It smells in here, man.

51
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,101
Jeremiah!

52
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,186
You get out here this instant!

53
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,438
Hi, Mom.

54
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,232
Now!

55
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:17,359
What's up?

56
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:19,570
The devil's body count,
that's what's up.

57
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:22,322
Don't you know what
"KlSS" stands for?

58
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:24,992
Knights In Satan's Service.

59
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:26,743
-Where is Karen Carpenter?
-How would I know?

60
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:30,372
-You have Donny and Marie, too?
-Why would l?

61
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:35,377
I had a nightmare that bullshit
like this might happen.

62
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:37,588
If he misses Peter Criss'
drum solo...

63
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:39,756
he won't be able to continue
with his life.

64
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:41,800
Lex, quit jinxing us, man.

65
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:44,094
Nobody's missing that concert
tomorrow night.

66
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:28,514
They're larger-than-life
space-age comic-book heroes...

67
00:06:28,514 --> 00:06:31,517
the most sensational phenomenon
of the past decade.

68
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:32,684
Their fans are fanatical.

69
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:36,271
Each fan has a favorite,
each one a fantasy.

70
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:44,696
The rock-and-roll band Kiss
is in town.

71
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:48,325
For some people, that spells
trouble with a capital "T".

72
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:08,095
I shall resign the presidency
effective at noon tomorrow.

73
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,055
Kiss is hotter than hell!

74
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:12,015
The protesters
are mainly religious groups.

75
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:14,059
Satan worship and drugs
among our kids.

76
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:16,520
Each 12 1/2-inch figure
sold separately.

77
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:13,660
-Jam.
-Hawk.

78
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:17,122
Listen. We're in a bit
of a quandary right now.

79
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:20,000
-They're fucking gone!
-What's gone?

80
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:22,961
What do you think?
The Kiss tickets!

81
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,087
Gone?

82
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:27,382
-Please tell me you have them.
-Why would I have them?

83
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:28,592
I don't know, man.

84
00:08:28,634 --> 00:08:31,053
Check whatever you were wearing
last night.

85
00:08:33,305 --> 00:08:34,598
Now, man!

86
00:08:42,064 --> 00:08:43,482
I got 'em.

87
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:45,275
He's got 'em.

88
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:47,569
I must have taken Trip's jacket
by mistake.

89
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:49,279
I'm really sorry about that.

90
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:51,156
Don't be such a wuss, Jam.

91
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:52,783
Are you grounded?

92
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:57,162
Yeah, but has that ever
stopped me before?

93
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:59,122
See you guys at school.

94
00:09:00,082 --> 00:09:02,084
Poor Jam, man.

95
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:04,086
Imagine having to stash
your Kiss records...

96
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:06,421
in Carly Simon album covers.

97
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:08,215
How shitty is that?

98
00:09:08,257 --> 00:09:09,424
No question.

99
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:12,261
Mrs. Bruce is a psycho bitch
from hell.

100
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:13,929
You're one to talk, Lex.

101
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:15,472
Your mom's a fuckin' dyke.

102
00:09:15,514 --> 00:09:17,599
Just because she's
a female gynecologist...

103
00:09:17,683 --> 00:09:19,142
that doesn't mean
she's a lesbian.

104
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:20,686
Even if she was...

105
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:23,564
at least my mom didn't
give birth to me while on LSD.

106
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:25,107
Shrooms!

107
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:27,234
Will you guys
quit the mom bashing?

108
00:09:27,276 --> 00:09:30,737
Lex's mom is cool because she
lets us spend the night...

109
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:32,531
and if it wasn't
for your mom, Trip...

110
00:09:32,573 --> 00:09:35,576
we wouldn't have smoked
that fine Panama Red last night.

111
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:38,412
So leave the women
who gave you life out of it.

112
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:39,705
They're both cool.

113
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:41,039
Let's go.

114
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:47,671
-Trip, you asshole!
-What?

115
00:09:47,713 --> 00:09:50,507
You spilled the bong water
all over the bed.

116
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:52,092
Stupid...

117
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,386
Come on.

118
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:59,558
Jeremiah, it's time to go.
Get--

119
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,519
What are you doing?

120
00:10:02,561 --> 00:10:05,147
Just, uh, whew!

121
00:10:05,147 --> 00:10:06,607
Getting a little sunshine.

122
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:09,401
You're gonna be late
if you don't change soon.

123
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:11,778
Change?

124
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,281
What's wrong with the clothes
I wore last night?

125
00:10:14,323 --> 00:10:16,783
It's dirty laundry,
for one thing.

126
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:20,037
And you still haven't tried on
the clothes I bought you.

127
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:23,665
You're skating on thin ice,
so I wouldn't push my luck.

128
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:25,209
Get out of those rags.

129
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,585
Mom, it's--

130
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:28,712
And, besides,
those jeans are so tight...

131
00:10:28,754 --> 00:10:31,048
I can see your penis.

132
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:32,257
Excuse me.

133
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,844
This jacket,
it stinks of B.O.

134
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:39,097
It's enough
to make a person sick.

135
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:40,307
Now, remember.

136
00:10:40,349 --> 00:10:41,725
I have my church meeting...

137
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:44,728
so you'll be on
the honor system tonight.

138
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:47,564
I'll be home
a little after one.

139
00:10:47,606 --> 00:10:49,066
And if you've been partying...

140
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:51,693
or playing
that satanic Kiss music...

141
00:10:54,238 --> 00:10:56,740
need I remind you
of the consequences?

142
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:01,537
Grounded for the rest
of the year?

143
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:03,705
You are a smart boy.

144
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:07,042
Put these on
before they go out of style.

145
00:11:07,084 --> 00:11:09,002
Come on, take it.

146
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:28,564
Man, school.
What a fuckin' waste of time.

147
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:31,483
I wish someone would tell
these chicks that disco's dead!

148
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:34,570
Don't stare too long, boys.
You'll go blind.

149
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:35,779
Yeah, right.

150
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:41,410
Stellas. I hate Stellas
almost as much as I hate dogs.

151
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:44,079
Yeah, man. Same species
when you think about it.

152
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:54,131
Shit, man.
That geek looks like Jam.

153
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,302
That geek is Jam.

154
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:00,053
Hey, dork!

155
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:07,269
Who did your wardrobe?

156
00:12:07,311 --> 00:12:10,314
Tad the Preppie
Sailboat Captain?

157
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:13,442
My mom had me over a barrel,
all right?

158
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:16,320
After last night,
I had to let her dress me.

159
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:17,487
It's a give-and-take
relationship.

160
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:19,281
She gives you shit,
and you take it.

161
00:12:19,323 --> 00:12:21,116
Hey, Jam,
hand over the tickets.

162
00:12:21,158 --> 00:12:22,993
Tickets?

163
00:12:23,035 --> 00:12:24,494
What?

164
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:27,706
There's a, uh...
Iittle, little problem.

165
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:30,209
They're still at my house
in Trip's jacket.

166
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,752
What are you talking about?

167
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:34,171
She was standing over me
when I was changing.

168
00:12:34,213 --> 00:12:35,714
You are so pathetic.

169
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:38,091
That's some sick shit
right there, man.

170
00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:40,469
Does she comb your ass hair
for you, too?

171
00:12:40,511 --> 00:12:42,221
If she even smells
those tickets...

172
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:43,514
she'll destroy 'em...

173
00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:46,266
and we miss Kiss
for the third year in a row.

174
00:12:46,308 --> 00:12:48,101
It's gonna be OK.
Don't worry.

175
00:12:48,143 --> 00:12:50,270
They're at my house.
They're perfectly safe.

176
00:12:50,312 --> 00:12:52,064
We'll go there after school
and pick them up.

177
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:54,316
My mom's not even
gonna be there.

178
00:12:54,358 --> 00:12:58,403
Hours from now we're actually
gonna be seeing Kiss.

179
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:00,447
We'll just double-time it
to your house...

180
00:13:00,489 --> 00:13:01,615
grab the tickets...

181
00:13:01,657 --> 00:13:03,492
then head
to the train station...

182
00:13:03,534 --> 00:13:08,080
for the three forty-five
to Detroit Rock City!

183
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:09,540
God!

184
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,459
Well, as they say
in the tampon biz...

185
00:13:12,501 --> 00:13:14,253
see you next period.

186
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:20,676
Jerk.

187
00:13:43,115 --> 00:13:45,075
I'm sorry.

188
00:13:45,075 --> 00:13:46,785
It's not a problem.

189
00:13:46,827 --> 00:13:48,453
Thanks.

190
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:50,622
Fine.

191
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,090
Hey, Beth.

192
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:03,510
I'm so sorry.

193
00:14:03,552 --> 00:14:06,722
Mr. Bruce, Miss Bumsteen,
is there a problem?

194
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:09,016
Uh, no, there...

195
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:11,101
there's no problem.

196
00:14:11,185 --> 00:14:12,603
I'm so sorry.

197
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:14,062
Don't worry about it.

198
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:24,448
I wanted to tell you something.

199
00:14:24,448 --> 00:14:26,074
What?

200
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:31,788
I know we don't know each other
that well or anything, but...

201
00:14:31,997 --> 00:14:33,373
But what?

202
00:14:36,418 --> 00:14:41,131
Today is gonna be the last time
I can--

203
00:14:41,173 --> 00:14:43,634
I'm mov--

204
00:14:43,675 --> 00:14:45,511
Jeremiah Bruce,
please come to the office.

205
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:48,388
Jeremiah Bruce,
come to the office immediately.

206
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,182
Give me that microphone!

207
00:14:50,224 --> 00:14:52,601
Jeremiah Bruce!
This is your mother!

208
00:14:52,601 --> 00:14:56,230
You are in big trouble,
young man.

209
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:59,149
What I found in the pocket of
that stinky jacket of yours...

210
00:14:59,191 --> 00:15:01,151
has me more than livid.

211
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:04,112
You get your little fanny
out of that seat...

212
00:15:04,154 --> 00:15:07,115
and you meet me
in the front office.

213
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:08,659
How dare you do this!

214
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,328
How dare you humiliate me
after I work so hard for you!

215
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:13,455
You take my hard-earned money...

216
00:15:13,497 --> 00:15:17,125
and you and your idiot friends
spend it...

217
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:19,086
on Kiss tickets?!

218
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:46,822
Sit!

219
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,534
You don't understand.

220
00:15:50,534 --> 00:15:52,327
Oh, I understand perfectly.

221
00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:55,038
And so will
Father Philip McNulty.

222
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:58,667
You're sending me
to boarding school?

223
00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:00,169
What else can I do?

224
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:03,630
Records, magazines,
comic books, that's one thing...

225
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:06,008
but tickets.

226
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:08,427
Do you realize what this means?

227
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:11,388
You are no longer content merely
hearing their awful music...

228
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:13,390
and looking at photos
of their horrific faces.

229
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:15,392
Now you want to see the devil
in the flesh!

230
00:16:15,434 --> 00:16:18,437
You want to reach out
and touch pure evil.

231
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,314
And in Detroit, no less.

232
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,149
It's been a long time coming...

233
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:08,278
but you are finally going to get
the discipline you deserve.

234
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,404
But, Mom--

235
00:17:09,446 --> 00:17:10,614
Shut up!

236
00:17:23,961 --> 00:17:25,087
I knew it.

237
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:27,130
We're completely fucked.

238
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:29,967
For once, Lex is right.

239
00:17:29,967 --> 00:17:31,593
Can't get any worse from here.

240
00:17:31,635 --> 00:17:35,138
I hope you rodents
have hall passes.

241
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,015
Fuck, it's Elvis!

242
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:43,188
Could that be three detentions
I smell?

243
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:46,441
Second floor, girls bathroom.
He'll never find us there.

244
00:17:55,325 --> 00:17:58,120
Fuck! Son of a bitch, man!

245
00:17:58,161 --> 00:17:59,454
Take it easy, man.

246
00:17:59,496 --> 00:18:00,956
This is the girls crapper,
remember?

247
00:18:00,998 --> 00:18:02,207
Wake up, Lex!

248
00:18:02,249 --> 00:18:05,961
We just watched Jam's mom
torch ourfucking Kiss tickets!

249
00:18:06,003 --> 00:18:08,005
Not REO Speedwagon...

250
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:10,632
not Journey,
not the Bay City Rollers.

251
00:18:10,674 --> 00:18:12,176
Kiss, man!

252
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:15,053
If you know a better reason
to trash a girls bathroom...

253
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:17,097
I'd sure like to hear it.

254
00:18:17,806 --> 00:18:19,391
What the fuck are you doing?

255
00:18:19,433 --> 00:18:21,977
-This is school.
-So what?

256
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:27,524
I think we're clear, dudes.

257
00:18:30,402 --> 00:18:32,070
Let's go.

258
00:18:34,531 --> 00:18:36,783
-Shit. Girls, girls.
-Shit.

259
00:19:02,726 --> 00:19:04,561
Sharon Van Hoft.

260
00:19:04,603 --> 00:19:07,648
I've had the hots for her
since second grade.

261
00:19:15,489 --> 00:19:18,659
Man, I've never heard a girl
blow ass before.

262
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:33,090
Get the fuck out!

263
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:34,591
Sorry.

264
00:19:51,316 --> 00:19:54,528
God forbid someday
you have a son like you.

265
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:56,572
A boy who lies
through his teeth...

266
00:19:56,613 --> 00:19:58,407
buys demonic records...

267
00:19:58,448 --> 00:20:00,367
and smokes the dope.

268
00:20:34,318 --> 00:20:35,777
Sorry. Sorry.

269
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,120
Anyone upfor an enema?

270
00:20:46,371 --> 00:20:47,623
Shit, man.

271
00:20:47,664 --> 00:20:50,334
Maybe some music
will cheer us up.

272
00:20:53,504 --> 00:20:56,548
Simple Simon
on the rock of Detroit...

273
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:58,759
home of the biggest
Kiss giveaway...

274
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,594
in the history of the universe!

275
00:21:00,636 --> 00:21:02,471
I got four front-row tickets...

276
00:21:02,513 --> 00:21:04,598
along with four
backstage passes...

277
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,726
to the concert tonight
at Cobo Hall...

278
00:21:07,768 --> 00:21:11,522
and I'm giving 'em
to the 106th caller...

279
00:21:11,563 --> 00:21:14,775
who can tell me the real names
of each Kiss band member.

280
00:21:14,816 --> 00:21:16,109
Oh, shit.

281
00:21:21,365 --> 00:21:23,158
This is horse shit.

282
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,327
It's too bad we're stuck
in this prison.

283
00:21:28,372 --> 00:21:29,498
I got it.

284
00:21:33,252 --> 00:21:36,380
Mr. Verudi,
get back to your bench.

285
00:21:36,421 --> 00:21:39,550
I gotta take a leak
like you would not believe.

286
00:21:39,591 --> 00:21:42,094
Put a clothespin on it
till the end of class.

287
00:21:42,135 --> 00:21:43,262
But, Mr. J...

288
00:21:43,303 --> 00:21:46,139
ever since my doctor
put me on these salt pills--

289
00:21:46,181 --> 00:21:47,766
Salt pills?

290
00:21:47,808 --> 00:21:50,018
Don't insult my intelligence.

291
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:54,565
Oh, man,
I'm taking a leak in my pants.

292
00:22:00,571 --> 00:22:02,197
Get the hell out of here.

293
00:22:02,239 --> 00:22:03,699
You disgust me.

294
00:22:18,005 --> 00:22:21,508
I need to be connected
to the WURP contest line.

295
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:23,385
Now, lady, come on!

296
00:22:26,054 --> 00:22:28,056
Oh, yeah, man!

297
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:32,311
I won!

298
00:22:32,352 --> 00:22:36,356
We! We won!

299
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:39,026
We're going to Detroit!

300
00:22:45,324 --> 00:22:49,119
This is the greatest thing that
ever happened to me in school.

301
00:22:49,161 --> 00:22:51,496
Not only are we on
for Kiss in Detroit...

302
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:55,292
but we're gonna be sitting
front row, center, man.

303
00:22:55,334 --> 00:22:58,504
Guys, our band Mystery
is a quartet, right?

304
00:22:58,545 --> 00:23:00,756
We can't go on the road
without our drummer.

305
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:03,425
Jam's mom said something about
taking him to St. Bernard's.

306
00:23:03,467 --> 00:23:06,053
I say we bust him
the hell out of there.

307
00:23:06,094 --> 00:23:08,680
St. Bernard's
is in the next county.

308
00:23:08,722 --> 00:23:11,975
Your mom's car
has a CB, radar detector...

309
00:23:12,017 --> 00:23:13,101
cruise control, check.

310
00:23:13,143 --> 00:23:15,687
We're not stealing
my mom's car, OK?

311
00:23:15,729 --> 00:23:17,439
Damn right, we are, man.

312
00:23:17,481 --> 00:23:19,233
One ding on that Volvo...

313
00:23:19,274 --> 00:23:21,735
and I'm fucked when my mom
gets back from Cincinnati.

314
00:23:21,777 --> 00:23:24,112
She won't even know
we touched it.

315
00:23:24,154 --> 00:23:26,740
If one thing happens to the car,
I'm blaming you.

316
00:23:26,782 --> 00:23:28,325
I'm gonna say you drugged me.

317
00:23:28,325 --> 00:23:29,660
I say we leave.

318
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,453
Hold on.
We're ditching school?

319
00:23:31,495 --> 00:23:33,247
About time if you ask me.

320
00:23:33,288 --> 00:23:35,374
I'm just going
through the motions...

321
00:23:35,415 --> 00:23:37,376
till I'm old enough
to drop out anyway.

322
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:39,127
Shit.
Guys, Elvis alert.

323
00:23:40,295 --> 00:23:43,048
I notice the trays
match your outfits.

324
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:44,800
Did you plan that?

325
00:23:47,719 --> 00:23:49,263
Excuse me, ladies.

326
00:23:50,097 --> 00:23:52,140
He stinks!

327
00:24:22,713 --> 00:24:24,339
I'm responsible for that!

328
00:25:01,043 --> 00:25:02,711
Pray hard, Jeremiah.

329
00:25:02,753 --> 00:25:04,755
God loves you.

330
00:25:04,963 --> 00:25:06,256
That he does.

331
00:25:06,298 --> 00:25:09,468
God bless you,
Father McNulty.

332
00:25:17,726 --> 00:25:21,355
If you think that recklessness
and disobedience...

333
00:25:21,396 --> 00:25:22,648
can get you expelled...

334
00:25:22,689 --> 00:25:24,107
think again.

335
00:25:24,149 --> 00:25:26,735
St. Bernard's may punish you...

336
00:25:26,777 --> 00:25:29,154
even for the slightest
digression, but...

337
00:25:29,196 --> 00:25:32,324
it'll never cast you out,
even for the largest.

338
00:25:32,366 --> 00:25:35,285
So, here you are, Jeremiah.

339
00:25:35,327 --> 00:25:37,412
Here to stay.

340
00:26:08,735 --> 00:26:11,572
Damn, man, come on.
Let's go bust him out.

341
00:26:11,613 --> 00:26:14,199
No, man.
We can't just waltz in there.

342
00:26:14,241 --> 00:26:16,159
We've gotta figure out a plan.

343
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:23,750
The eagle's landed,
you guys.

344
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:34,052
You kids know where
Philip McNutly's office is?

345
00:26:37,055 --> 00:26:38,390
You ordered a pizza?

346
00:26:38,432 --> 00:26:41,143
-What's the damage, young man?
-Ten even.

347
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:51,153
If he offers you a slice,
you're not hungry.

348
00:26:53,363 --> 00:26:57,534
Ten dollars, and I'm donating
your tip to the church.

349
00:26:57,576 --> 00:26:58,660
The Lord thanks you.

350
00:26:58,702 --> 00:27:01,205
Tell the big guy
not to mention it.

351
00:27:01,246 --> 00:27:02,998
I am famished.

352
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:06,376
Well, hope you brought a lunch
for yourself.

353
00:27:06,418 --> 00:27:08,962
No, but I'm not hungry anyway.

354
00:27:09,004 --> 00:27:10,964
Oh, it finally speaks.

355
00:27:11,048 --> 00:27:13,217
There's one barrier
we've broken through.

356
00:27:22,017 --> 00:27:26,480
Your coming here reminds me
of the Prodigal Son.

357
00:27:26,522 --> 00:27:30,192
Once, there was a man,
and he had two sons.

358
00:27:30,234 --> 00:27:33,362
They both grew up on the farm
with him.

359
00:27:33,403 --> 00:27:36,073
One day--

360
00:27:54,216 --> 00:27:58,053
That was a very stale mushroom.

361
00:27:58,095 --> 00:27:59,555
Well...

362
00:27:59,596 --> 00:28:01,098
where was l?

363
00:28:01,098 --> 00:28:03,600
Man, come on,
this is such a lousy view.

364
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,436
How are we supposed to know
when he's lit?

365
00:28:06,478 --> 00:28:09,481
It usually takes ten minutes
to half an hour.

366
00:28:09,523 --> 00:28:10,732
All depends, you know?

367
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,573
He's lit.

368
00:28:24,121 --> 00:28:27,541
I've been telling that sermon
for years.

369
00:28:27,583 --> 00:28:29,710
This is the first time
I've realized...

370
00:28:29,751 --> 00:28:33,672
it's the work of some
comedy mastermind.

371
00:28:33,714 --> 00:28:38,552
The Prodigal Son is a barrel
of fuckin' monkeys.

372
00:28:38,594 --> 00:28:39,761
Wait, wait!

373
00:28:39,803 --> 00:28:41,763
You kids can't go in there.

374
00:28:41,805 --> 00:28:45,184
No, it's OK. We're old buds
of Father McNulty's.

375
00:28:45,225 --> 00:28:46,602
How's it hangin', padre?

376
00:28:46,643 --> 00:28:50,272
I just heard you talking
through my nose.

377
00:28:50,314 --> 00:28:54,109
Is it possible
my nose has eardrums?

378
00:28:54,151 --> 00:28:55,694
Nosedrums.

379
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:59,615
We're here to take
ourfriend Jam...

380
00:28:59,656 --> 00:29:04,077
to the big satanic Kiss concert
tonight if that's OK with you.

381
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:05,954
Satan? Satan?

382
00:29:05,996 --> 00:29:07,122
Santa.

383
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:12,002
They're the same letters.
They're the same guy.

384
00:29:12,044 --> 00:29:14,713
It's the same friggin' guy.

385
00:29:14,755 --> 00:29:17,299
What the hell are you doing,
Sister Gonorrhea?

386
00:29:17,341 --> 00:29:19,134
Waitin' for a bus?

387
00:29:44,326 --> 00:29:47,287
You'll still get rowdy
with the girls and boys

388
00:29:47,329 --> 00:29:51,500
'Cause it's time
for you to take a stand

389
00:29:51,542 --> 00:29:53,335
Yeah, whoo

390
00:29:53,377 --> 00:29:55,754
Shout it, shout it

391
00:29:55,796 --> 00:29:58,674
Shout it out loud

392
00:29:58,715 --> 00:30:00,551
You've got to have a party

393
00:30:00,592 --> 00:30:03,512
Shout it, shout it

394
00:30:03,554 --> 00:30:05,097
Shout it out loud

395
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,225
Whoa, dudes, man.

396
00:30:08,308 --> 00:30:10,477
I just had
the killerest vision, man.

397
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:13,105
Imagine Mystery...

398
00:30:13,146 --> 00:30:16,024
opening up for Kiss, man.

399
00:30:16,024 --> 00:30:17,693
Oh, that'd be fucking it.

400
00:30:17,734 --> 00:30:21,154
Yeah, man.
It could happen, man.

401
00:30:21,196 --> 00:30:25,367
You know, in '73, Kiss was
opening for Blue Oyster Cult.

402
00:30:25,409 --> 00:30:27,703
One year later to the day,
man...

403
00:30:27,744 --> 00:30:30,539
Blue Oyster Cult
was opening for Kiss.

404
00:30:30,581 --> 00:30:32,082
We're not opening for anybody...

405
00:30:32,124 --> 00:30:34,710
until our lead singer
gets over his stage fright.

406
00:30:34,751 --> 00:30:36,253
God, man.

407
00:30:36,253 --> 00:30:38,380
I don't have fucking
stage fright, Lex.

408
00:30:38,422 --> 00:30:40,465
Then why'd you pass out
on stage at Bing's party...

409
00:30:40,507 --> 00:30:41,758
before the first
fucking song?

410
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,344
That was one show, man.

411
00:30:44,386 --> 00:30:47,389
That was our only show, and you
dropped like a dead deer on us.

412
00:30:47,389 --> 00:30:48,557
Shut up.

413
00:30:52,102 --> 00:30:53,729
I'm solid gold

414
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:55,522
I got the goods

415
00:30:55,564 --> 00:30:59,276
They stare when I walk
through the neighborhood

416
00:30:59,318 --> 00:31:01,320
I'm makin' it

417
00:31:01,361 --> 00:31:05,324
I got the chance,
I'm takin' it

418
00:31:05,365 --> 00:31:07,034
No more, no more

419
00:31:07,075 --> 00:31:09,036
Fakin' it

420
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:10,287
This time in life

421
00:31:10,329 --> 00:31:12,581
I'm takin' it

422
00:31:12,623 --> 00:31:14,458
Woo woo woo

423
00:31:14,499 --> 00:31:16,168
Makin' it

424
00:31:16,877 --> 00:31:18,712
Gimme this pizza.

425
00:31:19,713 --> 00:31:21,298
It's the last piece.

426
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:23,342
It's mine, all right?

427
00:31:25,677 --> 00:31:28,722
Fuck, man. Only a car full
of Stellas and Guidos...

428
00:31:28,764 --> 00:31:31,433
would ride your ass
on a two-lane highway and honk.

429
00:31:31,475 --> 00:31:33,435
Oh, man.

430
00:31:33,477 --> 00:31:37,147
Listen, everyone here

431
00:31:37,189 --> 00:31:38,649
This coming year's gonna

432
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:40,275
Be my year

433
00:31:40,317 --> 00:31:42,069
I'm as bad as they come

434
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:43,737
Number two to no one

435
00:31:43,779 --> 00:31:45,614
I got looks, I got brains

436
00:31:45,656 --> 00:31:48,200
And I'm breaking these chains

437
00:31:48,242 --> 00:31:50,327
Throw that shit out
before it stains the up--

438
00:31:50,369 --> 00:31:53,038
Throw it out of the car,
you asshole!

439
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,456
Come on, man!

440
00:31:56,041 --> 00:31:57,793
I'm makin' it

441
00:32:02,005 --> 00:32:03,966
Oh, fuck, man.

442
00:32:04,007 --> 00:32:06,510
Kenny, you asshole,
you just killed a bird.

443
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:07,636
That's no bird.

444
00:32:07,678 --> 00:32:10,639
That's a hunk of fuckin' cheese,
Kenny.

445
00:32:10,681 --> 00:32:12,516
A hunk of fuckin' cheese?

446
00:32:12,558 --> 00:32:15,143
We just pissed off
the lncredible Hulk...

447
00:32:15,185 --> 00:32:18,188
his idiot half brother,
and two circus clowns.

448
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:20,482
I'm gonna fuckin' kill
these bastards.

449
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,655
Pull the fuckin' car over!

450
00:32:28,156 --> 00:32:29,658
I'm gonna fuckin'--
Pull over!

451
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:30,826
No way, man.

452
00:32:31,034 --> 00:32:32,494
You're dead!

453
00:32:32,536 --> 00:32:34,162
Suck my cock!

454
00:32:34,204 --> 00:32:36,081
You should pull over
and apologize.

455
00:32:36,123 --> 00:32:38,083
This motherfucker's dead!

456
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:43,422
The paint!

457
00:32:44,673 --> 00:32:46,216
Fuck!

458
00:32:47,551 --> 00:32:48,677
Pull over!

459
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:05,402
Out of the car.

460
00:33:05,444 --> 00:33:06,570
Fuck.

461
00:33:09,406 --> 00:33:11,533
Oh, shit!
God--

462
00:33:15,245 --> 00:33:18,248
Oh, God!
Aah, shit!

463
00:33:19,583 --> 00:33:21,793
That's not funny, Kenny.

464
00:33:22,002 --> 00:33:23,128
Oh, God!

465
00:33:27,758 --> 00:33:30,052
Oh, that's not very nice, man.

466
00:33:30,093 --> 00:33:32,346
You are a complete asshole,
Kenny.

467
00:33:37,184 --> 00:33:38,644
Not the fag music.

468
00:33:38,727 --> 00:33:40,437
Get out of the way.

469
00:33:40,479 --> 00:33:42,356
Cut it with the macho crap
already.

470
00:33:43,607 --> 00:33:45,567
This is about pizza, man.

471
00:33:45,609 --> 00:33:48,737
Can we try and leave Kiss
out of it?

472
00:33:48,779 --> 00:33:53,075
What, a bunch of guys
who make bad music...

473
00:33:53,116 --> 00:33:54,451
dress like freaks...

474
00:33:54,493 --> 00:33:56,703
and wear more makeup
than all my sisters combined?

475
00:33:56,745 --> 00:34:00,123
No. These assholes
gotta be stopped.

476
00:34:02,584 --> 00:34:04,586
That's it.
I'm leaving.

477
00:34:06,255 --> 00:34:07,381
Christine.

478
00:34:08,423 --> 00:34:10,384
Jesus.

479
00:34:11,218 --> 00:34:13,345
You googats in the head
or something?

480
00:34:13,387 --> 00:34:15,347
We're on the side of
the freakin' highway.

481
00:34:15,347 --> 00:34:16,473
Fuck her.

482
00:34:16,515 --> 00:34:20,269
Kool and the Gang,
that's music.

483
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:21,436
But this?

484
00:34:21,478 --> 00:34:23,188
This is crap.

485
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,356
That's crap.

486
00:34:34,366 --> 00:34:35,492
All right, fag-mo.

487
00:34:35,534 --> 00:34:38,036
Have you learned
your lesson yet, puke?

488
00:34:38,078 --> 00:34:39,580
Well...

489
00:34:39,663 --> 00:34:44,418
if the lesson is that
you're a dick with ears...

490
00:34:44,459 --> 00:34:45,752
and a really bad haircut...

491
00:34:45,794 --> 00:34:48,505
I'd say yeah,
I learned my lesson.

492
00:34:49,631 --> 00:34:52,551
-Break his fucking legs, Kenny.
-Fuckin'--

493
00:35:23,707 --> 00:35:26,668
Come on,
we can talk about this, right?

494
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:29,755
You know,
maybe reason a little bit.

495
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:38,263
When these guys wake up,
they're gonna look for you.

496
00:35:38,305 --> 00:35:39,681
You best hope
they don't find you...

497
00:35:39,723 --> 00:35:42,392
'cause if they do,
they're gonna kick your asses.

498
00:35:42,434 --> 00:35:45,562
Oh, yeah, Stella.
And we'll deserve it, too.

499
00:35:45,604 --> 00:35:47,648
But you know what I'm gonna do?

500
00:35:47,689 --> 00:35:50,526
I'm gonna make it
really worth their while.

501
00:35:55,405 --> 00:35:56,532
Oh, God!

502
00:36:05,707 --> 00:36:07,751
Thanks for letting us
use your makeup supply.

503
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,337
You must have the entire
Revlon factory in your purse...

504
00:36:10,379 --> 00:36:12,548
you greasy disco ball.

505
00:36:12,589 --> 00:36:14,007
Very funny.

506
00:36:14,049 --> 00:36:16,218
I hope you fuckin'
choke to death and die...

507
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:17,719
you loser-ass motherfuckers!

508
00:36:17,761 --> 00:36:19,054
Disco sucks!

509
00:36:19,096 --> 00:36:20,764
Fuck you!

510
00:36:20,973 --> 00:36:23,225
Fuck! Fuck!

511
00:36:24,685 --> 00:36:26,979
They put the fag makeup on you.

512
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,438
They put the fag makeup on?

513
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,440
The fuckin' fag makeup's on you.

514
00:36:32,609 --> 00:36:35,988
Oh, no.
I got fag makeup on me.

515
00:36:48,792 --> 00:36:50,794
Hey, look.
It's that girl.

516
00:36:51,003 --> 00:36:53,589
Man, that's no girl.
That's a Stella.

517
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:56,008
Yeah, well,
Stella or no Stella...

518
00:36:56,049 --> 00:36:58,051
we should pull over
and help her out.

519
00:36:58,093 --> 00:37:00,262
Fuckin' inbred oaf.

520
00:37:00,304 --> 00:37:03,348
Kenny.
Fuck you.

521
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:05,100
Fuckin' kick your ass.

522
00:37:05,142 --> 00:37:07,352
Man, what the hell
is wrong with you?

523
00:37:07,394 --> 00:37:09,479
You got a thing for that thing?

524
00:37:09,521 --> 00:37:12,482
It's a teenage girl walking
along the side of the highway.

525
00:37:12,482 --> 00:37:17,029
They make scary movies
that start out like that.

526
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:19,573
Hey, but they make
porno movies...

527
00:37:19,615 --> 00:37:21,491
that start out
like that, too, man.

528
00:37:41,678 --> 00:37:45,057
Oh, great. Just hitched a ride
with a bunch of potheads.

529
00:37:45,057 --> 00:37:47,601
Look, I'm trying to hook up
with some people...

530
00:37:47,643 --> 00:37:50,437
at this funky place in Detroit
called Disco lnferno.

531
00:37:50,479 --> 00:37:52,481
You mind dropping me there?

532
00:37:52,523 --> 00:37:54,149
What's it worth to you?

533
00:37:54,191 --> 00:37:56,318
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

534
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,779
It doesn't mean anything.
Don't pay attention to him.

535
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:01,073
It's more like Disco's lnfernal.

536
00:38:01,114 --> 00:38:02,741
Ooh, you hot baby, you.

537
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:06,328
You know,
your clothes may say disco...

538
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:08,539
but your eyes say rock and roll.

539
00:38:10,249 --> 00:38:13,210
Well, your belt buckle
may say rock and roll...

540
00:38:13,252 --> 00:38:17,339
but your breath
says pepperoni, baby.

541
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:20,634
Are you gonna, like,
suck our dicks, or what?

542
00:38:20,676 --> 00:38:22,010
What?

543
00:38:22,052 --> 00:38:24,221
-That's so fuckin' rude, man.
-Fuck you, Jam.

544
00:38:24,263 --> 00:38:27,391
Stop being a wussy sensitive guy
just to impress her.

545
00:38:27,432 --> 00:38:29,977
She's obviously not
gonna put out, man.

546
00:38:30,018 --> 00:38:32,396
She's a tease, man.

547
00:38:32,437 --> 00:38:35,774
A tease? What the hell did I do
to tease you mongoloids?

548
00:38:35,983 --> 00:38:38,068
You got in the fuckin' car,
didn't you?

549
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:39,653
How calculating of me
to lead you on like that...

550
00:38:39,695 --> 00:38:41,530
after you offered me a ride
in the middle of nowhere.

551
00:38:41,572 --> 00:38:43,532
Whatever, Stella.

552
00:38:43,574 --> 00:38:45,701
My name's Christine.
Not Stella.

553
00:38:45,742 --> 00:38:48,495
You don't have to be such pigs
'cause I prefer Donna Summer...

554
00:38:48,537 --> 00:38:53,083
or K.C. and the Sunshine Band
or the Village People over Kiss.

555
00:38:53,125 --> 00:38:55,419
Fuckin' Village People.
They're a fag band.

556
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,712
They take it up the coast.

557
00:38:56,753 --> 00:38:59,464
All right, all right, guys.

558
00:38:59,506 --> 00:39:02,092
Thanks, but I can take
care of myself, Germ.

559
00:39:03,635 --> 00:39:04,720
Whatever.

560
00:39:04,928 --> 00:39:07,556
OK, dope burnout, let's get
one thing straight here.

561
00:39:07,598 --> 00:39:10,726
As far as I'm concerned,
good tunes is good tunes.

562
00:39:10,934 --> 00:39:13,103
Disco or rock or polka
or whatever have you...

563
00:39:13,145 --> 00:39:14,980
regardless of the category.

564
00:39:15,022 --> 00:39:17,357
Disco is just easier
to dance to.

565
00:39:17,399 --> 00:39:20,736
You call that Denny Terio,
John Travolta shit dancing?

566
00:39:20,944 --> 00:39:23,989
You know something?
Disco's so fucking big now...

567
00:39:24,031 --> 00:39:27,159
I wouldn't be surprised if Kiss
did a disco song someday.

568
00:39:27,201 --> 00:39:29,328
If it's one thing
Kiss will never do...

569
00:39:29,369 --> 00:39:30,746
it's a bullshit disco song.

570
00:39:30,746 --> 00:39:32,289
No shit, man.

571
00:39:32,331 --> 00:39:36,418
Yeah. Disco blows dogs
for quarters, man.

572
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:37,753
That's an intelligently
biting remark...

573
00:39:37,961 --> 00:39:39,254
wrought with wit and irony.

574
00:39:39,296 --> 00:39:40,756
If you don't like that one...

575
00:39:40,964 --> 00:39:42,299
maybe you'll think
it's really funny...

576
00:39:42,299 --> 00:39:45,135
when we kick your fuckin' ass
out of the car.

577
00:39:45,135 --> 00:39:47,262
Why don't you put your money
where your mouth is?

578
00:39:47,304 --> 00:39:49,306
Why don't you lick
my hairy crack?

579
00:39:49,348 --> 00:39:52,976
Why don't you bend over?
You're looking right at it.

580
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:58,273
That last remark
fell about thirty yards away...

581
00:39:58,315 --> 00:40:01,068
from making any sense
whatsoever.

582
00:40:01,109 --> 00:40:03,278
You're right.

583
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,113
Bend over,
you're looking right at it?

584
00:40:05,155 --> 00:40:07,449
What the hell is that
supposed to mean anyway?

585
00:40:09,618 --> 00:40:11,703
Give me a hit off that "J,"
will ya?

586
00:40:11,745 --> 00:40:13,455
That's some kick-ass shit.

587
00:41:07,092 --> 00:41:08,719
Move out of my way!

588
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:12,347
Lex, thank you for letting us
borrow your mom's car, man.

589
00:41:12,389 --> 00:41:14,766
Man, that weed knocked her
straight on her ass.

590
00:41:14,808 --> 00:41:17,102
She's sleeping
like a baby Stella.

591
00:41:17,144 --> 00:41:19,521
Man, let's lift up her skirt.

592
00:41:19,563 --> 00:41:21,565
-There it is!
-What?

593
00:41:21,607 --> 00:41:25,152
Holy fuck! We made it.
Oh, my God.

594
00:41:28,572 --> 00:41:30,449
Oh, my God!
Thank you!

595
00:41:35,245 --> 00:41:36,371
Man.

596
00:41:39,082 --> 00:41:42,211
I'm going into swarm-o mode.

597
00:41:42,252 --> 00:41:43,420
Oh, shit!

598
00:41:50,344 --> 00:41:52,554
I'm the King of
the Nighttime World!

599
00:41:54,389 --> 00:41:56,141
This is better
than the first time...

600
00:41:56,183 --> 00:41:58,519
I got to finger a chick, man.

601
00:42:00,771 --> 00:42:02,105
It's happening, man!

602
00:42:02,147 --> 00:42:03,232
WURP!

603
00:42:03,273 --> 00:42:05,067
This is so lucky.

604
00:42:05,108 --> 00:42:07,194
We got two hours to spare!

605
00:42:07,236 --> 00:42:10,364
-Check out that parking space.
-Get in there!

606
00:42:10,405 --> 00:42:13,617
Ample time to go to the station
and grab our tickets.

607
00:42:13,659 --> 00:42:16,286
God is smiling down
upon us tonight.

608
00:42:16,328 --> 00:42:20,123
That's weird. I figured
he'd be pissed as hell at me.

609
00:42:25,671 --> 00:42:27,589
Fuck, yeah!

610
00:42:27,631 --> 00:42:29,007
Oh, baby!

611
00:42:32,177 --> 00:42:34,429
This is so awesome, man.

612
00:42:34,471 --> 00:42:36,265
No way, man!

613
00:42:36,306 --> 00:42:38,058
I can't wait!

614
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:39,685
We're going to Kiss

615
00:42:45,107 --> 00:42:46,483
Let's get out of here, man.

616
00:42:47,317 --> 00:42:50,070
-Simple Simon?
-The one and only.

617
00:42:51,655 --> 00:42:53,282
You kids
have to hurry this up.

618
00:42:53,323 --> 00:42:55,617
I'm due at Cobo Hall
in a half hourfor the warmup.

619
00:42:55,659 --> 00:42:57,035
We're right behind you, Simon.

620
00:42:57,077 --> 00:43:00,414
We want to thank you in advance
for those burly-ass ticks.

621
00:43:00,455 --> 00:43:02,207
Your name isn't Trip, is it?

622
00:43:02,249 --> 00:43:04,168
Oh, no.
My name's Trip.

623
00:43:04,209 --> 00:43:06,253
Remember?
We were talking on the phone?

624
00:43:08,213 --> 00:43:09,631
Go, caller.

625
00:43:09,673 --> 00:43:12,426
Eugene Klein, Stanley Eisen...

626
00:43:12,467 --> 00:43:15,512
Peter Crisscoula,
and Paul Frehley.

627
00:43:15,554 --> 00:43:17,472
You just got yourself
four tickets...

628
00:43:17,514 --> 00:43:19,391
and four backstage passes...

629
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:23,604
-...at Cobo Hall tonight!
-We won!

630
00:43:23,604 --> 00:43:26,690
Stay on the line so we
can get yourfull name...

631
00:43:26,732 --> 00:43:29,359
Trip? You didn't hang up on me,
did you, Tri--

632
00:43:29,401 --> 00:43:31,445
What kind of total moron...

633
00:43:31,486 --> 00:43:34,156
would hang up
after winning Kiss tickets?

634
00:43:34,198 --> 00:43:37,242
Well, there you have it.
We had no choice.

635
00:43:37,284 --> 00:43:38,702
We gave the tickets
to the next caller.

636
00:43:38,744 --> 00:43:40,287
I'm sorry.

637
00:43:50,422 --> 00:43:52,049
Relax!

638
00:43:52,090 --> 00:43:53,342
Get off of him!

1
00:44:06,812 --> 00:44:07,938
This noise machine...

2
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:11,233
is more than just a quartet
of lousy musicians.

3
00:44:11,275 --> 00:44:14,653
There's a woman who abuses
her privilege of motherhood.

4
00:44:14,653 --> 00:44:17,531
-What is Kiss backwards?
-Ssik!

5
00:44:19,658 --> 00:44:20,785
Oh, shit!

6
00:44:20,826 --> 00:44:22,745
Guys, where's the Volvo?

7
00:44:22,745 --> 00:44:25,915
It was fucking stolen, man.

8
00:44:25,956 --> 00:44:27,958
Christine stole it.
Sleep, my ass.

9
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,960
The Stella booted
with your mom's wheels.

10
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:32,505
Son of a bitch, man!
How can this happen?

11
00:44:32,546 --> 00:44:33,964
Why are you laughing?

12
00:44:34,006 --> 00:44:35,674
I'm starting to get real mad.

13
00:44:35,716 --> 00:44:37,134
Jam, you ass!

14
00:44:37,176 --> 00:44:39,804
Why'd you talk us
into picking up this bitch?

15
00:44:39,845 --> 00:44:42,640
I'm sorry, man.
I was trying to be nice.

16
00:44:42,682 --> 00:44:43,849
I'm sick of your nice shit!

17
00:44:43,849 --> 00:44:46,310
Drummers are supposed
to have some fucking balls.

18
00:44:46,352 --> 00:44:48,854
Fuck you, man.
I was being conscientious.

19
00:44:48,896 --> 00:44:51,524
I didn't think she was
going to steal his mom's car.

20
00:44:51,565 --> 00:44:54,276
Jam, just shut your
faggotty-ass mouth, OK?

21
00:44:54,318 --> 00:44:55,736
You're pissing me off.

22
00:44:55,778 --> 00:44:57,738
Now, we came all this way...

23
00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:59,824
we got an hour
and forty-five minutes...

24
00:44:59,865 --> 00:45:02,868
and we got absolutely nothing.

25
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:06,914
So help me, God,
we are going to that concert.

26
00:45:06,956 --> 00:45:10,126
We must get the cops in
on this Volvo situation.

27
00:45:10,167 --> 00:45:12,670
Lex, this is Detroit.

28
00:45:12,712 --> 00:45:16,048
You think the cops will waste
city dollars on a Swedish car?

29
00:45:17,049 --> 00:45:18,008
You're right.

30
00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:20,011
My mom's got insurance.

31
00:45:20,052 --> 00:45:21,637
Why am I freaking out?

32
00:45:21,721 --> 00:45:23,639
It's cool. She's gonna try
to ground me for a year.

33
00:45:23,681 --> 00:45:24,765
I don't give a shit, man.

34
00:45:24,807 --> 00:45:26,225
Exactly.
Cool, bro.

35
00:45:26,267 --> 00:45:29,061
Oh, shit!
Man, I'm in big trouble!

36
00:45:29,061 --> 00:45:31,731
I'm in big fucking trouble!
The car's gone, man!

37
00:45:31,772 --> 00:45:33,274
Shut the fuck up, man!

38
00:45:33,315 --> 00:45:35,026
We're trying to think!

39
00:45:35,067 --> 00:45:36,819
Wait a second, man.

40
00:45:36,861 --> 00:45:38,904
I know how we can get
the fucking tickets, man.

41
00:45:38,988 --> 00:45:42,033
We beat the fucking shit
out of four little kids.

42
00:45:42,074 --> 00:45:44,076
Like,
take their fuckin' tickets.

43
00:45:44,118 --> 00:45:46,579
Brilliance, Trip.
Sheer fuckin' brilliance.

44
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:48,706
Why don't you give
Albert Einstein here...

45
00:45:48,748 --> 00:45:51,625
the fuckin' Nobel Prize?!

46
00:45:52,668 --> 00:45:56,047
Look, I think I can
barter with a scalper.

47
00:45:56,088 --> 00:45:58,758
If you guys can think of
a better plan, go for it.

48
00:45:58,799 --> 00:46:01,594
For the next hour and a half,
it's every dude for himself.

49
00:46:01,594 --> 00:46:05,014
We'll reconvene
at that intersection at 8:45.

50
00:46:05,056 --> 00:46:07,767
I'll see you guys later.
Good luck.

51
00:46:07,767 --> 00:46:09,810
I don't know
what the fuck we're doing.

52
00:46:12,104 --> 00:46:14,940
Look around you tonight,
mothers.

53
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:18,194
Look at all the young faces.

54
00:46:18,235 --> 00:46:21,072
Oh, they smile
and they laugh...

55
00:46:21,113 --> 00:46:23,616
but their eyes
have lost all hope.

56
00:46:23,657 --> 00:46:25,701
This satanic group Kiss...

57
00:46:25,743 --> 00:46:28,621
has stolen their souls!

58
00:46:29,330 --> 00:46:30,623
We--

59
00:46:32,124 --> 00:46:34,585
Shit.

60
00:46:41,092 --> 00:46:43,844
I do not know
how you got here tonight...

61
00:46:43,886 --> 00:46:45,721
and I do not want to know.

62
00:46:45,763 --> 00:46:47,306
All I know is...

63
00:46:47,515 --> 00:46:50,976
you are going to pay dearly
for this one, young man.

64
00:47:12,665 --> 00:47:13,833
Oh, my God.

65
00:47:13,833 --> 00:47:15,835
The mass, Father--
so inspirational.

66
00:47:15,835 --> 00:47:16,961
Father, thank you.

67
00:47:17,002 --> 00:47:18,129
Come again next week.

68
00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:19,255
Father.

69
00:47:19,296 --> 00:47:21,006
It's Jeremiah.

70
00:47:21,048 --> 00:47:22,633
I'm desperate.

71
00:47:22,675 --> 00:47:24,844
My son was about to defy God...

72
00:47:24,885 --> 00:47:26,971
by going to that
blasphemous Kiss concert.

73
00:47:27,013 --> 00:47:30,016
In that case,
come right in.

74
00:47:30,016 --> 00:47:32,935
He and his mom
just went into that church.

75
00:47:32,977 --> 00:47:35,187
Can I go and say
good-bye to him?

76
00:47:35,229 --> 00:47:39,525
Beth, I am not gonna let you
wander the streets after dark.

77
00:47:39,567 --> 00:47:43,237
I'm not going to wander.
I'm just going over there.

78
00:47:43,279 --> 00:47:46,198
Fine. As long as we know
where you are.

79
00:47:46,198 --> 00:47:47,324
Thank you.

80
00:47:47,533 --> 00:47:50,536
Don't be too long.
We need to get back on the road.

81
00:47:50,578 --> 00:47:53,039
-Stuart.
-Just relax.

82
00:47:53,039 --> 00:47:57,126
She's probably got a crush
on the kid or something.

83
00:48:04,592 --> 00:48:06,093
Hey, chief,
need a ticket?

84
00:48:06,177 --> 00:48:09,847
Second row, center,
but it's seventy-five clams.

85
00:48:09,889 --> 00:48:12,683
Aw, man, this is all I got.
Look.

86
00:48:13,934 --> 00:48:15,811
Scare up the extra gravy.

87
00:48:15,853 --> 00:48:17,021
Brother, take it easy.

88
00:48:17,063 --> 00:48:20,524
Where am I supposed to find
that kind of money in an hour?

89
00:48:22,234 --> 00:48:25,196
Well, um...
check it out over there.

90
00:48:25,237 --> 00:48:26,572
There's a contest going on.

91
00:48:26,614 --> 00:48:29,700
You take off your pants,
shake your wee-wee, get $100.

92
00:48:29,742 --> 00:48:33,662
I can't take off my clothes
and dance like that, man.

93
00:48:33,704 --> 00:48:36,499
That's embarrassing, man.

94
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:38,042
Check it out, man.

95
00:48:38,084 --> 00:48:40,127
The question you
got to ask yourself is...

96
00:48:40,169 --> 00:48:41,670
how badly do you want to see...

97
00:48:41,712 --> 00:48:43,798
the greatest fucking
rock-and-roll show...

98
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:45,216
on the fucking earth, right?

99
00:48:45,257 --> 00:48:48,219
You're talkin'
Gene and Paul live, y'all.

100
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:50,888
I'm talkin' about voluptuous
women in the audience.

101
00:48:50,930 --> 00:48:54,183
I'm talkin' big breastesses
in tight vestesses, my friend.

102
00:48:54,225 --> 00:48:56,977
You're talkin' people passin'
around joints in the audience.

103
00:48:57,019 --> 00:49:00,439
You're talkin' about
Detroit Rock City, brother.

104
00:49:00,481 --> 00:49:01,857
Shake your wee-wee.

105
00:49:01,899 --> 00:49:03,984
I got stage fright.

106
00:49:04,777 --> 00:49:06,737
And they're playing
fucking disco over there.

107
00:49:06,779 --> 00:49:08,906
Shit or get off the pot,
rock star.

108
00:49:08,948 --> 00:49:10,199
You want to dance?

109
00:49:10,241 --> 00:49:13,577
Or see Kiss on album covers
for the rest of your life?

110
00:49:15,955 --> 00:49:17,998
Mmm, second row, center,
brother.

111
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:19,458
Go shake your wee-wee.

112
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:21,127
You're gonna have that ticket
for me, right?

113
00:49:21,168 --> 00:49:23,879
Oh, yeah, man,
you got my solemn oath...

114
00:49:23,921 --> 00:49:26,215
as a public servant.

115
00:49:29,635 --> 00:49:31,053
Go for it, brother.

116
00:49:32,096 --> 00:49:33,889
All right.

117
00:49:33,931 --> 00:49:35,182
See you around.

118
00:49:39,645 --> 00:49:42,189
Hey, chief,
you need a ticket?

119
00:49:42,231 --> 00:49:44,775
Seventy-five bucks,
second row, center.

120
00:49:44,817 --> 00:49:46,277
I'm gonna beat my ticket...

121
00:49:46,527 --> 00:49:48,195
out of some poor
defenseless chump.

122
00:49:48,237 --> 00:49:49,947
You know what I mean?

123
00:49:49,989 --> 00:49:51,198
Yeah, whatever,
reefer-head.

124
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:53,659
You fuckin' burnout.

125
00:50:24,815 --> 00:50:26,192
Take it off, honey!

126
00:50:41,374 --> 00:50:42,666
Gimme!

127
00:50:45,378 --> 00:50:46,670
Don't do that.

128
00:50:52,259 --> 00:50:54,929
I need to sign up
for the contest, please.

129
00:50:54,970 --> 00:50:57,223
You're a little scrawny,
but thanks to the concert...

130
00:50:57,223 --> 00:50:58,808
we're low on amateurs.
Name?

131
00:50:59,725 --> 00:51:01,060
Pick a song, Hawk.

132
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:02,770
You got any Kiss?

133
00:51:02,812 --> 00:51:04,730
Doubtful.
Drink?

134
00:51:04,772 --> 00:51:06,065
Yeah. A man's drink.

135
00:51:10,569 --> 00:51:11,737
Oh, God.

136
00:51:14,949 --> 00:51:16,075
What's this?

137
00:51:16,117 --> 00:51:18,661
You've never seen
a bourbon on the rocks before?

138
00:51:20,705 --> 00:51:22,039
Save your money,
stud muffin.

139
00:51:22,081 --> 00:51:25,042
Lady at the end of the bar
sends her love.

140
00:51:34,010 --> 00:51:37,179
Oh. Shit.

141
00:51:39,598 --> 00:51:40,725
Cheers.

142
00:51:48,274 --> 00:51:49,692
God!

143
00:51:50,818 --> 00:51:53,279
It's gone bad.

144
00:52:10,004 --> 00:52:11,297
Hey, you little twerps.

145
00:52:11,505 --> 00:52:14,300
Give me your Kiss tickets,
or I'll pop yourfaces in.

146
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:16,177
But we don't have
any Kiss tickets.

147
00:52:16,218 --> 00:52:17,970
Yeah. Kiss sucks!

148
00:52:18,012 --> 00:52:20,097
What? I ought to kick
your asses for saying that.

149
00:52:20,139 --> 00:52:23,809
Give me this instead.
Now scram! Get out of here!

150
00:52:30,149 --> 00:52:31,275
Cool.

151
00:52:41,118 --> 00:52:42,995
Simple Simon comin' at you.

152
00:52:42,995 --> 00:52:46,791
It's thirty minutes and counting
until Kiss hits the stage...

153
00:52:46,832 --> 00:52:49,293
tonight at Detroit's
very own Cobo Hall...

154
00:52:49,335 --> 00:52:53,214
but until then,
here they are with "Shock Me"!

155
00:52:53,255 --> 00:52:54,799
Rock on, Ace!

156
00:53:20,282 --> 00:53:22,159
Hey, little kid!

157
00:53:22,201 --> 00:53:24,578
Shit! You just stumped
my last ball, you--

158
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:25,996
Scream and I'll kick
your head off.

159
00:53:26,038 --> 00:53:28,874
OK, booger,
your Kiss ticket or your life.

160
00:53:28,874 --> 00:53:30,876
Please, sir,
don't beat me up.

161
00:53:30,918 --> 00:53:33,170
I do have a Kiss ticket
but not on me.

162
00:53:33,212 --> 00:53:36,549
Oh, likely story.
Now hand it over, punk.

163
00:53:36,549 --> 00:53:40,011
No, really. My brother's
holding it for safekeeping.

164
00:53:40,052 --> 00:53:42,263
Please,
let me get him for you.

165
00:53:42,304 --> 00:53:44,056
Hey, Chongo.

166
00:53:55,067 --> 00:53:56,902
Look, little kid...

167
00:53:56,944 --> 00:53:59,530
I don't need to see Kiss
that bad.

168
00:53:59,572 --> 00:54:01,073
Don't try to run,
you maggot.

169
00:54:01,115 --> 00:54:03,826
Chongo's an all-state
track star in every event.

170
00:54:13,252 --> 00:54:17,089
Lookit, man,
you can have my wallet, OK?

171
00:54:17,089 --> 00:54:19,091
I was gonna take
your wallet anyway...

172
00:54:19,091 --> 00:54:21,093
after Chongo and his friends
crush your ribcage...

173
00:54:21,093 --> 00:54:23,596
Iike a pack of Luckys, punk.

174
00:54:23,637 --> 00:54:25,222
This fairy giving you shit, bro?

175
00:54:25,264 --> 00:54:28,059
He was gonna mug me
for my Kiss tickets.

176
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:29,560
That's nuts.

177
00:54:29,602 --> 00:54:32,897
I said, "Hey, little kid...

178
00:54:32,938 --> 00:54:34,940
"you know where I could
take a piss?"

179
00:54:39,653 --> 00:54:42,823
OK, pimple dick, you have
the option of walking outside...

180
00:54:42,865 --> 00:54:43,991
or gettin' dragged out.

181
00:54:44,033 --> 00:54:45,618
Please, sir.

182
00:54:45,659 --> 00:54:47,536
Don't kick my ass!

183
00:54:47,578 --> 00:54:50,956
I'll do anything
to get out of a beating.

184
00:54:50,956 --> 00:54:53,250
Say, Chongo...

185
00:54:53,292 --> 00:54:55,711
perhaps we could use
some extra cash...

186
00:54:55,753 --> 00:54:57,755
for tasty snacks
at the Kiss concert...

187
00:54:57,797 --> 00:55:00,257
our weaselly friend
won't be attending.

188
00:55:10,810 --> 00:55:12,812
Hey, move those lights
over there.

189
00:55:30,287 --> 00:55:31,789
Hey, you.

190
00:55:31,831 --> 00:55:33,833
Man.

191
00:55:33,874 --> 00:55:35,251
Hey, come back here!

192
00:55:37,545 --> 00:55:38,963
Shit!

193
00:55:39,004 --> 00:55:40,965
Come here!
Come here!

194
00:55:46,679 --> 00:55:50,641
All right, wise guy.
You are so out of here.

195
00:55:50,683 --> 00:55:53,978
Fuck! Keep your paws
to yourself, you dumb ape.

196
00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:55,855
Where'd he go?

197
00:56:00,985 --> 00:56:05,781
It's been a while since my boy
had Holy Confession.

198
00:56:05,823 --> 00:56:06,907
Could you please--

199
00:56:06,949 --> 00:56:08,701
Consider it done.

200
00:56:29,847 --> 00:56:31,182
It is about time...

201
00:56:31,223 --> 00:56:34,894
you gave up that stupid dream
of yours once and for all!

202
00:56:34,894 --> 00:56:38,272
No son of mine is going
to be a career musician...

203
00:56:38,314 --> 00:56:39,940
ever, ever, ever!

204
00:56:39,982 --> 00:56:41,984
Madam, madam.

205
00:56:42,026 --> 00:56:43,736
We are in a cathedral.

206
00:56:43,778 --> 00:56:45,071
I'll walk you out.

207
00:56:45,071 --> 00:56:47,573
Sorry. Sorry.

208
00:56:53,079 --> 00:56:55,623
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

209
00:56:55,706 --> 00:56:58,250
This is my first confession
in a...

210
00:56:59,919 --> 00:57:01,504
really long time.

211
00:57:11,555 --> 00:57:13,599
That was our Viking
Patrick Hirsch...

212
00:57:13,641 --> 00:57:15,226
and he's hung like a Norse.

213
00:57:15,267 --> 00:57:17,186
Our next amateur
has a name like a bird...

214
00:57:17,228 --> 00:57:19,271
and if you like birds,
you'll like this.

215
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:21,065
It's just a swallow.

216
00:57:21,107 --> 00:57:24,068
So, put your hands together,
make him feel at home...

217
00:57:24,110 --> 00:57:26,862
and please welcome...Hawk.

218
00:57:29,699 --> 00:57:31,867
Oh, shit.

219
00:57:31,909 --> 00:57:35,079
No, no, no, no.
No way, man.

220
00:57:35,121 --> 00:57:37,081
You're not going to
chicken out now, are you?

221
00:57:38,791 --> 00:57:40,209
You're right, Deacon.

222
00:57:41,293 --> 00:57:42,878
You're right, man.

223
00:57:43,963 --> 00:57:46,966
Shit! What am I saying?
I got to do this.

224
00:57:46,966 --> 00:57:48,134
It's for Kiss.

225
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:17,515
Oh, my God!

226
00:59:49,922 --> 00:59:52,508
Oh, the stink!

227
01:01:58,884 --> 01:02:01,262
Man! Dang!

228
01:02:08,769 --> 01:02:09,854
Man!

229
01:02:09,895 --> 01:02:11,897
Come back here, you punk!

230
01:02:11,939 --> 01:02:13,524
Move!

231
01:02:23,826 --> 01:02:24,952
Move it!

232
01:02:24,994 --> 01:02:27,038
Get off me, you bitch!

233
01:02:29,707 --> 01:02:32,084
Get up.
Come on, move it, sweetie.

234
01:02:32,126 --> 01:02:33,544
Watch it, asshole.

235
01:02:33,586 --> 01:02:36,547
Where is he?
Where did he go this time?

236
01:02:40,259 --> 01:02:41,719
Two hundred bucks?

237
01:02:41,761 --> 01:02:42,970
My time's precious...

238
01:02:43,012 --> 01:02:45,931
and that's a reasonable price
to pay for your sorry life.

239
01:02:45,931 --> 01:02:47,558
Hold on, man.

240
01:02:49,143 --> 01:02:51,937
Look, I know how
I can get the money.

241
01:02:51,979 --> 01:02:53,939
I just figured it out, man.

242
01:02:56,984 --> 01:02:59,070
But you might want
to wait outside.

243
01:02:59,111 --> 01:03:00,112
I don't trust him.

244
01:03:00,154 --> 01:03:01,947
I think he's on the level.

245
01:03:01,947 --> 01:03:04,784
He's too stupid to do
anything sneaky anyway.

246
01:03:04,784 --> 01:03:06,786
Look at him.
He's a moron.

247
01:03:08,621 --> 01:03:11,290
You got fifteen minutes
and not a second longer.

248
01:03:11,499 --> 01:03:15,711
Are you sure that you
don't want to talk about...

249
01:03:15,753 --> 01:03:19,924
oh, carnal knowledge
with a neighborhood girl?

250
01:03:19,965 --> 01:03:24,887
Or how about finding a box
of magazines, huh?

251
01:03:24,929 --> 01:03:26,764
Under your dad's bed?

252
01:03:30,309 --> 01:03:33,646
Then I suggest
you think of something...

253
01:03:33,688 --> 01:03:37,900
a little juicier to confess
than losing Kiss tickets.

254
01:04:00,965 --> 01:04:03,843
You waiting for a confession?
I thought you were Jewish.

255
01:04:03,884 --> 01:04:06,095
I have a confession.

256
01:04:19,316 --> 01:04:23,779
I didn't mean
for that to be so intense.

257
01:04:23,821 --> 01:04:25,031
I can take it.

258
01:04:26,657 --> 01:04:29,577
I've been in love with you
since the moment I saw you.

259
01:04:29,618 --> 01:04:32,788
I've just always been
too scared to show it.

260
01:04:32,788 --> 01:04:35,916
That's exactly the same way
I've always felt about you.

261
01:04:35,958 --> 01:04:38,044
Jeremiah, really?

262
01:04:38,085 --> 01:04:39,170
Really.

263
01:04:39,211 --> 01:04:42,214
And call me Jam.

264
01:04:42,214 --> 01:04:43,674
It's my band name.

265
01:04:51,724 --> 01:04:55,561
And now, for our grand prize
of one hundred dollars...

266
01:04:55,603 --> 01:04:57,563
Don't worry, ladies.
I'm not competing.

267
01:04:57,605 --> 01:04:59,774
If I did,
you'd want your money back.

268
01:04:59,815 --> 01:05:01,233
And the winner is...

269
01:05:03,569 --> 01:05:04,904
Sir Loin!

270
01:05:22,797 --> 01:05:25,257
Hey, don't look so sad.

271
01:05:25,299 --> 01:05:26,801
The night is young--

272
01:05:26,842 --> 01:05:29,303
filled with compensatory
possibilities.

273
01:05:31,555 --> 01:05:33,265
Oh, thanks for the drinks.

274
01:05:33,307 --> 01:05:35,893
That was really generous.

275
01:05:36,936 --> 01:05:41,273
There's no reason for me to be
around these parts anymore.

276
01:05:41,315 --> 01:05:44,110
I'm in a position
to spend some money on you...

277
01:05:44,151 --> 01:05:47,738
if you'd get in a position
and spend some time on me.

278
01:06:06,757 --> 01:06:09,218
I can't believe you're thinking
of robbing this store.

279
01:06:09,260 --> 01:06:11,053
You don't pass "Go" and collect
two hundred dollars...

280
01:06:11,095 --> 01:06:12,972
for pulling stuff like this.

281
01:06:12,972 --> 01:06:15,307
No shit.
Is this really worth it?

282
01:06:15,474 --> 01:06:17,268
Sure, you're going
to get your ass kicked...

283
01:06:17,309 --> 01:06:19,729
nine ways to Sunday
by that fucking gorilla...

284
01:06:19,770 --> 01:06:22,523
but that's still
a hundred times better...

285
01:06:22,565 --> 01:06:25,568
than getting it porked
for the next three to five.

286
01:06:25,609 --> 01:06:27,236
What about that girl, Trip?

287
01:06:27,278 --> 01:06:29,530
She'll never forget this night.

288
01:06:29,572 --> 01:06:32,742
Even if you get away with it,
she'll be scarred for life.

289
01:06:32,783 --> 01:06:35,745
When are you going to realize
that sometimes being tough...

290
01:06:35,786 --> 01:06:37,705
means being tender?

291
01:06:37,747 --> 01:06:40,166
All right, everybody,
shut up!

292
01:06:54,764 --> 01:06:56,766
I'm going to have
to do this sometime.

293
01:07:05,024 --> 01:07:06,692
Might as well be now.

294
01:07:08,903 --> 01:07:10,029
Evening, honey.

295
01:07:10,696 --> 01:07:12,698
You know what I am,
what this is...

296
01:07:12,698 --> 01:07:14,992
and what you need to do,
so let's do it quick.

297
01:07:15,034 --> 01:07:16,660
Everybody else...

298
01:07:16,702 --> 01:07:20,039
kindly introduce yourselves
to the floor and kiss it hello.

299
01:07:22,041 --> 01:07:23,959
Do it or die, bitch.

300
01:07:24,001 --> 01:07:25,669
I'm just a high school kid.

301
01:07:26,712 --> 01:07:28,297
Fuck school!

302
01:07:28,506 --> 01:07:31,801
I went through the motions till
I was old enough to drop out.

303
01:07:31,842 --> 01:07:34,595
And where's all that studying
going to get you tonight?

304
01:07:34,637 --> 01:07:38,516
Robbed at gunpoint and possibly
shot in the fucking head!

305
01:07:40,226 --> 01:07:43,229
Hey, scumbag, drop it,
or I'll blow your head off.

306
01:07:48,651 --> 01:07:50,528
You and what army?

307
01:07:54,073 --> 01:07:55,700
The Kiss Army.

308
01:08:30,943 --> 01:08:32,570
Oh, God, they're in there.

309
01:08:50,838 --> 01:08:52,506
Oh, shit!

310
01:08:52,548 --> 01:08:53,674
Come on!

311
01:09:09,982 --> 01:09:12,151
God, if you
get me out of this...

312
01:09:12,193 --> 01:09:15,738
I swear I will never
pull my pork again.

313
01:09:17,281 --> 01:09:19,033
Give me your gun, boy.

314
01:09:19,075 --> 01:09:20,743
You give me your gun, boy.

315
01:09:20,785 --> 01:09:22,953
I don't even think
you have a gun.

316
01:09:22,995 --> 01:09:24,497
Neither do l.

317
01:09:24,538 --> 01:09:26,624
For the last time...

318
01:09:26,665 --> 01:09:28,542
take the piece out...

319
01:09:28,584 --> 01:09:29,919
Iay back down...

320
01:09:29,919 --> 01:09:31,921
or your mom's
going to need Mr. Clean...

321
01:09:31,921 --> 01:09:34,590
to get the brains
out of your ski cap!

322
01:10:16,882 --> 01:10:19,010
Thank you.

323
01:10:20,344 --> 01:10:21,721
Who are you?

324
01:10:21,721 --> 01:10:24,181
Eh, they call me Dr. Love.

325
01:10:39,655 --> 01:10:41,115
Is it true that Gene Simmons...

326
01:10:41,157 --> 01:10:44,201
had a cow's tongue grafted
onto his real tongue?

327
01:10:44,243 --> 01:10:45,995
I think he, uh...

328
01:10:46,037 --> 01:10:48,372
had the piece of skin
under his tongue removed...

329
01:10:48,581 --> 01:10:50,249
so he could
stick it out farther.

330
01:10:50,291 --> 01:10:52,752
I was going to
send you this, but...

331
01:10:53,753 --> 01:10:54,920
Ann Arbor?

332
01:10:54,962 --> 01:10:58,382
Yeah. My dad's company
is relocating him.

333
01:10:58,591 --> 01:11:01,010
That's why I was acting
so freaky at school today.

334
01:11:01,093 --> 01:11:03,721
I thought it'd be the last time
I'd ever see you.

335
01:11:16,817 --> 01:11:18,527
Oh, fuck.

336
01:11:20,863 --> 01:11:23,991
You'd better have something
really sinful for me this time.

337
01:11:24,033 --> 01:11:26,744
All right, Father,
here it is.

338
01:11:26,786 --> 01:11:28,829
I feel a little ashamed
talking to you about this...

339
01:11:28,913 --> 01:11:31,791
but I went
to my cousin's wedding...

340
01:11:31,832 --> 01:11:33,667
and one of the bridesmaids...

341
01:11:33,709 --> 01:11:36,754
asked me if I wanted
to take a bath.

342
01:11:36,796 --> 01:11:38,964
This is terrible.

343
01:11:39,006 --> 01:11:40,716
This girl was a total fox...

344
01:11:40,758 --> 01:11:43,010
so I finally
gave into temptation...

345
01:11:43,052 --> 01:11:44,887
about a block away
from the wedding reception...

346
01:11:44,929 --> 01:11:46,931
at this little motel
that charges by the hour.

347
01:11:46,972 --> 01:11:49,767
When she peeled off that gown...

348
01:11:49,809 --> 01:11:55,022
you are not going to believe
what she was wearing underneath.

349
01:11:55,064 --> 01:11:56,357
Was it a teddy?

350
01:11:57,900 --> 01:11:59,652
A bustier?

351
01:12:00,695 --> 01:12:02,154
Satin underwear?

352
01:12:03,823 --> 01:12:05,658
Crotchless panties?

353
01:12:05,658 --> 01:12:07,785
Leopard-skin bra?

354
01:12:08,828 --> 01:12:10,538
Fishnet leotard?

355
01:12:10,579 --> 01:12:13,040
A leather G-string?

356
01:12:14,250 --> 01:12:17,002
All right, guys, here.
You want a sandwich?

357
01:12:17,002 --> 01:12:19,130
Come on. Go. Go!

358
01:12:19,171 --> 01:12:21,882
OK, fuck it, man.
I give up.

359
01:12:25,845 --> 01:12:28,889
Oh, God, man, what now?
Wolves?

360
01:12:40,026 --> 01:12:41,986
All right.

361
01:12:57,710 --> 01:13:00,713
I jump in the car.
I hot-wire it in thirty seconds.

362
01:13:00,755 --> 01:13:03,215
I start driving.
Suddenly, I hear this scream.

363
01:13:03,257 --> 01:13:06,844
The disco queen was asleep
in the backseat the whole time.

364
01:13:07,887 --> 01:13:09,889
What are we going
to do with her anyway?

365
01:13:09,930 --> 01:13:11,891
I don't know,
but she looks like fun.

366
01:13:17,063 --> 01:13:18,814
Hey, hey, take it easy.

367
01:13:19,815 --> 01:13:21,108
Ah, God.

368
01:13:21,150 --> 01:13:24,070
You don't want to get any
whiskey dick around here.

369
01:13:24,070 --> 01:13:26,781
Of course, you don't have
to worry about that.

370
01:13:28,741 --> 01:13:31,786
Aw, shit.

371
01:13:31,827 --> 01:13:34,288
I see you've met
Premature Peter.

372
01:13:34,538 --> 01:13:35,623
I'm sorry.

373
01:13:35,664 --> 01:13:36,916
That's OK.

374
01:13:36,957 --> 01:13:38,876
It's been quite a night.

375
01:13:38,918 --> 01:13:41,337
So far, you've seen
me and my dick throw up.

376
01:13:41,587 --> 01:13:44,548
I'm sure there's more
where that came from, right?

377
01:13:47,343 --> 01:13:49,178
Now come here.

378
01:14:02,274 --> 01:14:03,776
You guys better kill me...

379
01:14:03,776 --> 01:14:05,945
before you do what
you're thinking about doing...

380
01:14:05,986 --> 01:14:09,198
because when I get angry,
I can bite down very hard.

381
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:12,660
Sweet Polly Purebred's
got some spunk, huh?

382
01:14:12,660 --> 01:14:14,495
I'll give her some spunk,
all right.

383
01:14:14,537 --> 01:14:16,497
We can strip that Beemer
in fifteen minutes.

384
01:14:16,539 --> 01:14:18,958
I say we can strip her
in fifteen seconds.

385
01:14:20,042 --> 01:14:23,045
Now, wait a minute, guys.
Two on one ain't fair.

386
01:14:23,087 --> 01:14:25,256
Why don't you let me
get my friend Barbara?

387
01:14:25,297 --> 01:14:28,634
You'd love her--
tits the size of your head.

388
01:14:28,676 --> 01:14:30,553
You'll feel like
a little baby sucking on them.

389
01:14:30,594 --> 01:14:32,263
You guys like disco?

390
01:14:32,304 --> 01:14:34,557
I teach disco dancing
back at my church.

391
01:14:34,598 --> 01:14:36,767
You guys look like you got
a little rhythm in your blood.

392
01:14:36,809 --> 01:14:39,812
Free lessons if you let me go.

393
01:14:39,812 --> 01:14:44,191
Oh, I know a dance we could do--
the Horizontal Hustle.

394
01:14:48,237 --> 01:14:50,072
Hey, peanut turds.

395
01:14:50,114 --> 01:14:52,700
I'm here for the girl
and the car.

396
01:14:52,742 --> 01:14:54,577
You can try to stop me...

397
01:14:54,618 --> 01:14:56,245
but you're not going to like
what happens if you do.

398
01:14:56,287 --> 01:14:58,914
It's too bad.
He was such a young idiot.

399
01:14:58,956 --> 01:15:01,500
Hey, he's a stupid boy.

400
01:15:01,584 --> 01:15:03,502
He deserves to fucking die.

401
01:15:13,262 --> 01:15:15,639
Tear these grease monkeys
a new asshole!

402
01:15:26,859 --> 01:15:30,696
One step out of that office,
and your asses are Alpo.

403
01:15:33,699 --> 01:15:35,701
I always come prepared.

404
01:15:45,044 --> 01:15:46,962
You're the coolest.

405
01:15:47,004 --> 01:15:50,341
I believe you were promised
a ride to Disco lnferno.

406
01:15:50,549 --> 01:15:52,259
Let me escort you to the car.

407
01:15:52,301 --> 01:15:54,011
What about the fucking dogs?

408
01:15:54,053 --> 01:15:56,180
You got a phone in there, man?

409
01:15:56,222 --> 01:15:57,932
Call the cops.

410
01:15:57,973 --> 01:15:59,517
You're fuckin' dead!

411
01:16:04,563 --> 01:16:06,190
Beth, I feel like such an idiot.

412
01:16:06,232 --> 01:16:09,026
Why didn't I just say something
a year and a half ago?

413
01:16:09,068 --> 01:16:11,487
Don't think about the past.

414
01:16:11,529 --> 01:16:14,699
Let's just think about
from today on.

415
01:16:15,950 --> 01:16:17,743
I'll never forget you, Jam.

416
01:16:17,743 --> 01:16:19,995
Church will never be the same.

417
01:16:37,805 --> 01:16:40,599
God damn it, Beth!

418
01:16:40,599 --> 01:16:42,059
I'm coming, Dad.

419
01:16:43,602 --> 01:16:44,729
Well...

420
01:16:46,522 --> 01:16:48,065
So...

421
01:16:48,107 --> 01:16:51,610
I'll call you,
as soon as we get a phone.

422
01:16:51,652 --> 01:16:53,320
-All right.
-Yeah.

423
01:17:18,596 --> 01:17:19,764
I hope this helps.

424
01:17:19,805 --> 01:17:21,557
No, no.
You know what?

425
01:17:21,599 --> 01:17:23,184
Strange as it may seem...

426
01:17:23,225 --> 01:17:26,145
I don't think
I can take the money.

427
01:17:26,145 --> 01:17:28,606
It would cheapen
the whole experience.

428
01:17:28,647 --> 01:17:32,276
I ain't no Midnight Cowboy
or anything like that.

429
01:17:33,652 --> 01:17:35,196
I'm not paying you
for the lovemaking.

430
01:17:35,237 --> 01:17:37,198
I just want you to have this...

431
01:17:37,198 --> 01:17:40,159
for whatever you needed it for
when I made the offer.

432
01:17:44,747 --> 01:17:46,791
Thanks.

433
01:17:47,958 --> 01:17:49,710
Was there any money taken?

434
01:17:49,752 --> 01:17:50,836
Nope...

435
01:17:50,878 --> 01:17:54,590
but it is Smiley Mart's policy
to give a cash reward of $150...

436
01:17:54,632 --> 01:17:57,259
to anyone who stops a robbery.

437
01:17:58,260 --> 01:18:00,971
I gave him the money,
and he took off.

438
01:18:03,474 --> 01:18:05,267
Thanks.

439
01:18:05,476 --> 01:18:07,687
You see this guy again,
call us, all right?

440
01:18:07,728 --> 01:18:09,980
We want to ask him
a few questions.

441
01:18:10,022 --> 01:18:12,108
If I see Dr. Love again
anytime soon...

442
01:18:12,149 --> 01:18:15,486
you're going to have to wait
till I'm done with him first.

443
01:18:22,034 --> 01:18:23,994
One-thirty...

444
01:18:24,036 --> 01:18:26,914
one-forty, and one-fifty.

445
01:18:26,956 --> 01:18:28,958
That's all I got, man.

446
01:18:35,506 --> 01:18:37,675
I really wanted things
to work out for you...

447
01:18:37,717 --> 01:18:39,593
my weaselly,
dimwitted friend.

448
01:18:39,635 --> 01:18:41,929
You got spunk.

449
01:19:00,740 --> 01:19:03,743
At least I still got you,
Stretch.

450
01:19:08,706 --> 01:19:10,082
I took his head off.

451
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:20,092
Kiss? How dare they call
themselves Kiss.

452
01:19:20,134 --> 01:19:21,510
Kiss is about love.

453
01:19:21,552 --> 01:19:27,224
They are teaching our children
lust, betrayal, and hate.

454
01:19:27,266 --> 01:19:29,226
We as parents are obligated--

455
01:19:29,268 --> 01:19:30,895
How's it going, Mom?

456
01:19:32,188 --> 01:19:35,232
I'm going to ask you
this nicely first.

457
01:19:35,274 --> 01:19:36,901
Can I have my drumsticks back?

458
01:19:36,942 --> 01:19:41,530
Your drumsticks are the least
of your worries, young man.

459
01:19:41,572 --> 01:19:43,032
You ran out on God!

460
01:19:43,074 --> 01:19:45,743
My son just ran out on God!

461
01:19:45,785 --> 01:19:48,287
You are in a world of--

462
01:19:48,537 --> 01:19:50,164
Trouble?

463
01:19:50,206 --> 01:19:53,209
I've been in trouble
for the past twelve hours.

464
01:19:54,210 --> 01:19:57,505
I'm going to be in St. Bernard's
boarding school...

465
01:19:57,546 --> 01:19:59,799
for the next two years
of my life, remember?

466
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:03,094
I'm going to be out of your hair
until I am a legal adult!

467
01:20:03,135 --> 01:20:05,221
Then all you have to do
is go to church...

468
01:20:05,262 --> 01:20:07,932
Iight a candle, and pray
to some stupid statue...

469
01:20:07,973 --> 01:20:10,184
and all is forgiven
and forgotten, right, Mom?

470
01:20:10,226 --> 01:20:13,062
Then you can spend your days
in a guilt-free pursuit...

471
01:20:13,104 --> 01:20:14,980
of more constructive
activities...

472
01:20:15,022 --> 01:20:18,943
Iike telling everybody else
how screwed up their lives are.

473
01:20:18,984 --> 01:20:20,611
Then you no longer
need the patience...

474
01:20:20,653 --> 01:20:22,154
and understanding required...

475
01:20:22,196 --> 01:20:26,575
in order to talk to your own son
on some normal plane.

476
01:20:26,617 --> 01:20:28,619
That way,
you don't even need to think...

477
01:20:28,661 --> 01:20:31,580
about how tough it was for you
when you were growing up.

478
01:20:31,622 --> 01:20:33,999
It's probably a good thing, too,
'cause if you did...

479
01:20:34,041 --> 01:20:35,626
you'd realize what a lousy...

480
01:20:35,668 --> 01:20:38,713
goddamn,
shitty-ass parent you are.

481
01:20:43,884 --> 01:20:45,720
What has gotten into you?

482
01:20:47,221 --> 01:20:50,933
I just lost my virginity
in a confessional booth!

483
01:20:50,975 --> 01:20:53,811
Lord have mercy!

484
01:20:55,813 --> 01:20:57,064
Now...

485
01:20:57,106 --> 01:20:59,608
for the last time...

486
01:20:59,650 --> 01:21:03,738
Mom, give me back
my fucking drumsticks.

487
01:21:05,072 --> 01:21:06,198
Please.

488
01:21:22,048 --> 01:21:23,215
Cute.

489
01:21:41,192 --> 01:21:43,736
They grow upfast,
don't they?

490
01:21:45,905 --> 01:21:47,823
Hey, dude.

491
01:21:47,865 --> 01:21:50,076
Dude, I got the cash, man.
Check it out.

492
01:21:51,869 --> 01:21:53,954
No, that can't be
the last ticket!

493
01:21:53,996 --> 01:21:55,247
God!

494
01:21:55,998 --> 01:21:58,709
You fucking bastard!

495
01:22:42,002 --> 01:22:43,921
Any luck?

496
01:22:43,963 --> 01:22:48,134
Yeah, man, plenty,
but it was all bad, man.

497
01:22:48,175 --> 01:22:49,635
I found the Volvo.

498
01:22:52,555 --> 01:22:53,973
Tickets?

499
01:22:59,562 --> 01:23:01,564
Wait a second.
I know how we can get in.

500
01:23:01,605 --> 01:23:05,609
I say that we beat the shit
out of each other, right?

501
01:23:05,651 --> 01:23:07,111
Then we go
to the ticket taker...

502
01:23:07,153 --> 01:23:10,698
and we say that we got mugged
and our tickets were stolen.

503
01:23:10,740 --> 01:23:13,826
They have to let us in then,
right?

504
01:23:18,581 --> 01:23:19,874
Why not?

505
01:23:51,989 --> 01:23:53,157
Go.

506
01:23:54,158 --> 01:23:56,202
No! God!

507
01:23:56,243 --> 01:23:58,621
Oh, man,
you got to let us in.

508
01:23:58,662 --> 01:24:00,289
Four muggers
just stole our tickets.

509
01:24:00,498 --> 01:24:02,500
You expect me to believe that?

510
01:24:02,541 --> 01:24:04,543
Are you fucking kidding me?

511
01:24:05,961 --> 01:24:07,254
Look at us.

512
01:24:09,006 --> 01:24:10,508
It was those assholes
right there!

513
01:24:10,549 --> 01:24:12,093
They stole our tickets!

514
01:24:12,134 --> 01:24:14,220
Number thirteen!

515
01:24:14,261 --> 01:24:16,013
Hey, stop those guys.

516
01:24:20,601 --> 01:24:22,311
They got tickets.

517
01:24:22,520 --> 01:24:23,688
Let's see.
Come here.

518
01:24:23,729 --> 01:24:25,564
They even stole my wallet, man.

519
01:24:25,564 --> 01:24:28,109
I've never even seen
these assholes before.

520
01:24:28,150 --> 01:24:31,612
In there, you'll find
my Kiss Army picture l.D...

521
01:24:31,654 --> 01:24:33,698
and a hundred and fifty bucks
cash.

522
01:24:41,080 --> 01:24:42,707
-Out of here.
-Damn.

523
01:24:46,585 --> 01:24:48,921
My midget weaselly friend.

524
01:24:48,963 --> 01:24:52,925
I was really hoping things
could work out for you.

525
01:24:52,967 --> 01:24:54,969
You got spunk.

526
01:24:55,011 --> 01:24:57,054
Go.

527
01:24:57,096 --> 01:24:58,222
I got it, man.

528
01:24:58,264 --> 01:24:59,765
We're going.

529
01:25:27,835 --> 01:25:29,503
OK, then.

530
01:25:40,639 --> 01:25:41,932
We want Kiss!

531
01:25:57,782 --> 01:25:59,033
This is it.

532
01:26:03,579 --> 01:26:06,290
You wanted the best,
and you got the best!

533
01:26:06,499 --> 01:26:08,501
The hottest band in the world--

534
01:26:08,584 --> 01:26:10,044
Kiss!

535
01:26:27,853 --> 01:26:30,648
I feel uptight
on a Saturday night

536
01:26:33,025 --> 01:26:34,318
Nine o'clock

537
01:26:34,527 --> 01:26:37,613
The radio's the only light

538
01:26:38,739 --> 01:26:39,824
I hear my song

539
01:26:39,865 --> 01:26:41,534
And it pulls me through

540
01:26:43,786 --> 01:26:45,538
It comes on strong

541
01:26:45,579 --> 01:26:47,790
Tells me what I got to do

542
01:26:47,832 --> 01:26:48,916
I got to

543
01:26:48,958 --> 01:26:50,042
Get up

544
01:26:50,084 --> 01:26:51,919
Everybody's gonna
move their feet

545
01:26:51,961 --> 01:26:53,045
Get down

546
01:26:53,087 --> 01:26:55,673
Everybody's gonna
leave their seat

547
01:26:56,549 --> 01:27:00,219
You gotta lose your mind
in Detroit Rock City

548
01:27:00,261 --> 01:27:01,721
Get up

549
01:27:01,762 --> 01:27:03,097
Everybody's gonna
move their feet

550
01:27:03,139 --> 01:27:04,557
Get down

551
01:27:04,557 --> 01:27:06,058
Everybody's gonna
leave their seat

552
01:27:26,203 --> 01:27:29,081
Movin' fast,
doin' ninety-five

553
01:27:31,292 --> 01:27:33,252
I hit top speed

554
01:27:33,294 --> 01:27:35,880
Still movin' much too slow

555
01:27:37,256 --> 01:27:38,591
I feel so good

556
01:27:38,632 --> 01:27:40,968
I'm so alive

557
01:27:42,803 --> 01:27:44,263
I hear my song

558
01:27:44,305 --> 01:27:46,057
Playin' on the radio

559
01:27:46,098 --> 01:27:47,892
And it goes

560
01:27:47,933 --> 01:27:49,060
Get up

561
01:27:49,101 --> 01:27:52,229
Everybody's gonna
move their feet

562
01:28:16,754 --> 01:28:17,880
Get up

563
01:28:17,922 --> 01:28:20,925
Everybody's gonna
leave their seat

564
01:34:27,041 --> 01:34:29,001
We don't have any Kiss tickets.

565
01:34:29,001 --> 01:34:31,295
Yeah. Kiss sucks!

566
