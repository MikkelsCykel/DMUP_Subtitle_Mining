00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,022
It's almost like a spy film
in the intrigue...

2
00:00:02,057 --> 00:00:06,043
of this romantic encounter...

3
00:00:06,075 --> 00:00:10,830
between this guy
that Calvin plays...

4
00:00:10,872 --> 00:00:13,166
I'm sorry, there's a...

5
00:00:14,834 --> 00:00:16,791
Uh, and this woman.

6
00:00:16,833 --> 00:00:19,210
And anyway,
I think it's a neat story.

7
00:00:19,252 --> 00:00:22,839
And I think it's a great cast.

8
00:00:22,881 --> 00:00:27,799
Um, uh, but, uh...

9
00:00:27,841 --> 00:00:30,802
Yeah. I'm sorry,
I have some... it's weird.

10
00:00:30,844 --> 00:00:34,097
I'm really happy about
the project. I really am.

11
00:00:34,139 --> 00:00:37,348
I got... you know, there's...
I've got issues with some of...

12
00:00:37,389 --> 00:00:40,851
Actually, Calvin. Calvin is,
I think, I don't know...

13
00:00:40,893 --> 00:00:42,144
You know, other people...

14
00:00:42,186 --> 00:00:44,605
get more excited about him
than I do.

15
00:00:44,647 --> 00:00:48,064
It's not to say I'm not happy
having him on the movie.

16
00:00:48,105 --> 00:00:51,438
I think that's great, and
I'm sure he's very good in it.

17
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:57,274
I just don't get what
the big thing is with Calvin.

18
00:00:57,316 --> 00:01:01,570
I think... you know, you picture
a role in a certain way...

19
00:01:01,612 --> 00:01:04,448
And sometimes it's...
I'm not always right, either.

20
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:07,281
I know, you know, certainly
my wife thinks he's great.

21
00:01:15,328 --> 00:01:17,121
FRANCESCA:
I'm starving to death.

22
00:01:17,163 --> 00:01:19,165
- Well, I've got it right here,
- I might actually faint,

23
00:01:19,207 --> 00:01:21,376
OK, tuna, No celery,

24
00:01:21,417 --> 00:01:23,378
No celery and no,

25
00:01:23,419 --> 00:01:26,628
- Onion,
- Right,

26
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,756
Uh, so listen...

27
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:32,008
you know that thing
that we were talking about?

28
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:35,509
Um, I can't keep...

29
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,135
OK, I mean...

30
00:01:37,177 --> 00:01:39,805
Come on, come on,

31
00:01:39,846 --> 00:01:44,268
I'm uncomfortable dealing
with this aspect of your life.

32
00:01:44,309 --> 00:01:45,891
I don't want to talk to them,

33
00:01:45,933 --> 00:01:48,727
Well, I don't want
to talk to them, either.

34
00:01:48,769 --> 00:01:51,814
I don't even want to talk
to the guys I'm dating,

35
00:01:53,649 --> 00:01:57,650
Uh-huh.
Well, I'm not dating anyone.

36
00:01:57,692 --> 00:01:59,485
A date is not dating.

37
00:01:59,527 --> 00:02:02,446
Well, you know,
someone buys you dinner,

38
00:02:02,488 --> 00:02:04,699
you owe them a phone call,
in my opinion,

39
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,906
See, dinner...
that's where I fucked up.

40
00:02:06,948 --> 00:02:09,492
It should have been lunch,

41
00:02:11,202 --> 00:02:13,079
They all seem pretty nice
to me.

42
00:02:13,121 --> 00:02:16,288
Well, they don't strike you as,
like, networky, freaky,

43
00:02:16,329 --> 00:02:18,248
actress-dating
executive types,

44
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:22,002
with their water bottles
in, like, a mesh tote bag?

45
00:02:22,043 --> 00:02:24,296
This is really...
this is disgusting,

46
00:02:24,337 --> 00:02:26,795
I can't eat this,
That arugula is so bitter,

47
00:02:26,837 --> 00:02:28,797
It's like
my algebra teacher on bread,

48
00:02:28,839 --> 00:02:30,295
- OK,
- Ugh,

49
00:02:30,336 --> 00:02:33,089
I'm truly, I'm... look at me,

50
00:02:33,131 --> 00:02:35,255
I'm gonna faint,
I might actually faint,

51
00:02:35,297 --> 00:02:37,716
We all know how you get
when your blood sugar's low.

52
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:38,967
All right. I'll be right back.

53
00:02:39,009 --> 00:02:41,219
OK. Thank you.

54
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:44,014
- You're welcome,
- I need some wet naps, too,

55
00:02:44,055 --> 00:02:46,513
- OK,
- Tuna fingers,

56
00:02:46,555 --> 00:02:49,516
- Don't want tuna fingers,
- No, we don't,

57
00:02:49,558 --> 00:02:52,394
- You're an angel, Thank you,
- Oh, you're welcome,

58
00:02:52,436 --> 00:02:53,937
Oh, post-its!

59
00:02:56,061 --> 00:02:58,397
LEE: See, I knew
something was wrong, I just...

60
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:00,232
I didn't know it was that.

61
00:03:06,235 --> 00:03:08,738
I had that one this morning,

62
00:03:09,906 --> 00:03:11,240
CALVIN: Hey,

63
00:03:14,243 --> 00:03:17,201
I need to talk to you
about something,

64
00:03:17,243 --> 00:03:19,120
- Lee...
- Don't,

65
00:03:30,712 --> 00:03:32,923
Why did you even pursue this?

66
00:03:32,964 --> 00:03:37,090
What? Wait a minute.
You came over and spoke to me.

67
00:03:37,132 --> 00:03:38,967
Now, all of this began
because of you,

68
00:03:39,009 --> 00:03:40,928
Are you saying
you weren't attracted to me?

69
00:03:40,969 --> 00:03:42,054
No...

70
00:03:42,095 --> 00:03:46,680
Gus told me
to watch out for you,

71
00:03:49,433 --> 00:03:51,185
I'm forty-one tomorrow,
Calvin...

72
00:03:51,227 --> 00:03:52,895
the age where
I could have a stroke,

73
00:03:52,937 --> 00:03:54,230
in the middle of the night,

74
00:03:55,728 --> 00:03:58,272
If you think I'm not going
to Gus', you're,

75
00:04:00,233 --> 00:04:05,193
OK, I have a meeting,
Go fuck somebody else,

76
00:04:19,158 --> 00:04:21,118
- Hey,
- Hi,

77
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,829
- You're still here?
- Yeah, I was just upstairs,

78
00:04:23,871 --> 00:04:25,662
I was shopping
for my friend Gus,

79
00:04:25,703 --> 00:04:27,455
- Oh,
- Yeah,

80
00:04:27,497 --> 00:04:31,292
- Are you OK?
- Oh, yeah, I'm good,

81
00:04:31,334 --> 00:04:34,961
I've just had really some
sad cases today, so I'm just...

82
00:04:35,001 --> 00:04:37,420
- I'm sorry,
- I'm emotional,

83
00:04:37,462 --> 00:04:39,839
Yeah.
What did you get him?

84
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:44,886
- Who?
- What did you get Gus?

85
00:04:44,928 --> 00:04:47,678
Oh, They didn't have it,

86
00:04:47,719 --> 00:04:50,389
- What was it?
- Yeah,

87
00:04:52,182 --> 00:04:55,182
- Are you,
- It was a thing,

88
00:04:55,224 --> 00:04:58,269
He's... he's, uh,

89
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:01,522
It was... they didn't... you know,
'cause he's forty today,

90
00:05:01,564 --> 00:05:04,692
and I was just gonna get him
some, I don't know, this...

91
00:05:04,733 --> 00:05:05,982
- Are you OK?
- Yeah,

92
00:05:06,023 --> 00:05:07,900
I just have to go,
I'm really late, so...

93
00:05:07,942 --> 00:05:09,318
- Are you sure?
- Yeah,

94
00:05:13,322 --> 00:05:15,196
I'll call you later.

95
00:05:15,238 --> 00:05:16,948
Oh, OK,

96
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:18,616
Thank you.

97
00:05:22,453 --> 00:05:25,453
Um, you need to find him,

98
00:05:25,495 --> 00:05:27,372
I don't know if he knows
I'm here at the office,

99
00:05:27,414 --> 00:05:30,125
so I have to have a contact
name in order to transfer you.

100
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:33,128
Um, Harvey's not here
at the office right now.

101
00:05:33,169 --> 00:05:36,253
He sees on the TV a murder,

102
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:39,131
and as he listens to the murder,

103
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,341
His whole face
just goes white...

104
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:43,468
and he bolts
from his apartment.

105
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,927
Now, we follow him.

106
00:05:44,968 --> 00:05:47,678
The murders... they deviate
at this key point...

107
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,343
for reasons nobody can
understand, because...

108
00:05:50,385 --> 00:05:52,762
T ell Trevors I'm not gonna
do it, I'm not gonna do it,

109
00:05:52,804 --> 00:05:55,387
Good, good, Go, Sorry, Go ahead,

110
00:05:55,429 --> 00:05:56,763
Aah,

111
00:05:56,805 --> 00:05:59,641
My brother Bob
should look at this,

112
00:05:59,683 --> 00:06:01,852
Yeah, Good, Good!

113
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:03,937
- Great,
- Good,

114
00:06:03,979 --> 00:06:07,021
CALVIN: Motherfuckers,

115
00:06:07,062 --> 00:06:08,480
Did you see their faces
looking at us?

116
00:06:08,522 --> 00:06:09,565
Yes,

117
00:06:09,607 --> 00:06:11,442
It was like a labrador
staring at a Picasso,

118
00:06:11,483 --> 00:06:12,568
Right,

119
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:14,904
Ed, we walked in there

120
00:06:14,944 --> 00:06:17,528
- They want beer mugs,
- Yeah, right?

121
00:06:17,612 --> 00:06:20,156
I could so see myself
in that part,

122
00:06:20,198 --> 00:06:22,074
Right?

123
00:06:22,116 --> 00:06:23,910
Fuck!

124
00:06:23,951 --> 00:06:26,201
- It's all right,
- All right, I gotta go,

125
00:06:26,242 --> 00:06:27,619
- See you later,
- See you,

126
00:06:30,288 --> 00:06:32,749
Hey, Ed, keep the faith,

127
00:06:32,832 --> 00:06:35,207
It was good. It was good.

128
00:06:35,248 --> 00:06:38,335
- Mr, Liveright,
- Hey, hey, Bill,

129
00:06:38,376 --> 00:06:39,878
- Come on in,
- Thanks,

130
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,004
- Ann?
- Yeah,

131
00:06:41,046 --> 00:06:44,299
My massage is here,
I'll call you back in an hour,

132
00:06:44,341 --> 00:06:48,008
- How about in back? Good?
- OK, sure,

133
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:51,637
Um, what do you think
about the lighting?

134
00:06:51,678 --> 00:06:53,096
A little light... too bright?

135
00:06:53,138 --> 00:06:55,513
Whatever you're comfortable
with is fine, Yeah,

136
00:06:55,554 --> 00:06:58,516
I think a little darker,

137
00:06:58,557 --> 00:07:00,893
- Like so,
- Sure,

138
00:07:00,935 --> 00:07:03,103
- Need some help?
- No,

139
00:07:03,145 --> 00:07:05,269
Done it before, huh?

140
00:07:05,311 --> 00:07:08,648
"Bill Liveright"... great name,

141
00:07:08,689 --> 00:07:11,859
Well, a name with a message
is a good name, right?

142
00:07:11,901 --> 00:07:15,235
I don't know,
It just always eluded me,

143
00:07:15,276 --> 00:07:18,488
Mmm,
Money is just feminine energy,

144
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:23,326
Huh, It always seems so male,
I don't get it,

145
00:07:23,368 --> 00:07:26,243
Money: Mater, The Latin,

146
00:07:26,284 --> 00:07:29,037
You connect with that,

147
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:31,369
You make it sound pretty simple,

148
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:33,663
- It is,
- Just connecting with it,

149
00:07:33,704 --> 00:07:35,453
You're catching on, Ann,

150
00:07:35,495 --> 00:07:38,164
Look, don't be

151
00:07:38,206 --> 00:07:42,502
If you have purpose,
you can just wade right through,

152
00:07:42,544 --> 00:07:45,585
It's like running past
people who are asleep,

153
00:07:49,089 --> 00:07:50,549
OK,

154
00:07:52,092 --> 00:07:53,677
you can turn over now,

155
00:07:53,718 --> 00:07:57,553
I think I kind of drooled
a little bit,

156
00:07:57,594 --> 00:08:01,265
Just scoot your head down,
so you're not in the hole.

157
00:08:10,229 --> 00:08:11,856
OK,

158
00:08:17,066 --> 00:08:18,651
You're from L, A,?

159
00:08:18,693 --> 00:08:21,404
No, Miami, actually, You?

160
00:08:21,445 --> 00:08:23,239
- New York,
- Oh,

161
00:08:28,575 --> 00:08:30,869
Do you find me attractive?

162
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:31,953
What?

163
00:08:36,204 --> 00:08:38,165
Yes,

164
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,627
In what sort of way?

165
00:08:42,711 --> 00:08:45,043
In a human sort of way,

166
00:08:49,506 --> 00:08:51,467
- Ann,
- Bill,

167
00:08:51,508 --> 00:08:53,552
It's my birthday, Ann,

168
00:08:53,594 --> 00:08:54,845
- Really?
- Yeah,

169
00:08:54,886 --> 00:08:56,093
Happy birthday,

170
00:08:58,262 --> 00:09:01,140
What's your philosophy
on release?

171
00:09:01,182 --> 00:09:03,434
You know what, Bill, I know

172
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:05,725
and the thing is,
I don't do it, so,

173
00:09:05,766 --> 00:09:08,603
Right, Not even
for a little extra money?

174
00:09:08,644 --> 00:09:11,435
Mm-mmm, It's not
the kind of massage I do,

175
00:09:11,477 --> 00:09:12,561
Right,

176
00:09:12,603 --> 00:09:14,646
I offer a release
of tension and toxins,

177
00:09:14,688 --> 00:09:16,145
and sometimes emotion, but,

178
00:09:16,187 --> 00:09:17,855
Yes, well,

179
00:09:17,897 --> 00:09:20,483
Well, I don't do it, so...

180
00:09:20,524 --> 00:09:21,901
Oh, yeah,
You can come in thirty seconds?

181
00:09:21,942 --> 00:09:23,778
- Do you have a second-hand?
- Look, I can't do it,

182
00:09:23,819 --> 00:09:25,109
You could stop
after thirty seconds,

183
00:09:25,151 --> 00:09:26,611
Five hundred dollars,
When was the last time,

184
00:09:26,652 --> 00:09:28,362
you made five hundred dollars
for thirty seconds of work?

185
00:09:28,404 --> 00:09:30,490
- You're cruel,
- I'm not cruel, I'm practical,

186
00:09:30,531 --> 00:09:32,950
You need the cash,

187
00:09:32,992 --> 00:09:35,325
This is crazy,

188
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:37,118
Five hundred dollars, Ann,

189
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:44,000
You can't make any noise,

190
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:47,375
- The place is noisy,
- No, You can audibly exhale,

191
00:09:47,417 --> 00:09:48,835
You can't moan or grunt or sigh,

192
00:09:48,877 --> 00:09:51,129
I can't moan or grunt or sigh,
just audible exhale only?

193
00:09:51,171 --> 00:09:53,131
- Yes,
- Ahh!

194
00:09:53,173 --> 00:09:56,256
No, Too loud, And if
you do it... it's too much,

195
00:09:56,298 --> 00:09:59,760
I'll be quiet,
OK, Ann, I'll be quiet,

196
00:09:59,802 --> 00:10:01,386
Are you ready?

197
00:10:01,428 --> 00:10:03,096
Fuck.

198
00:10:03,138 --> 00:10:05,471
Are you ready?

199
00:10:05,513 --> 00:10:08,307
Will you just hand me
that plastic bag right there?

200
00:10:08,349 --> 00:10:10,434
Well, why?

201
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:12,478
No reason,

202
00:10:36,326 --> 00:10:38,620
Oh,

203
00:10:38,662 --> 00:10:40,330
Oh, my God,

204
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,460
Ahem,

205
00:10:55,502 --> 00:10:58,130
- Here,
- Thank you,

206
00:11:05,467 --> 00:11:07,553
GUS: Shit.

207
00:11:07,594 --> 00:11:09,513
- Hey, Ann?
- What?

208
00:11:09,555 --> 00:11:11,974
I'm sorry,
I thought I had more cash on me,

209
00:11:12,015 --> 00:11:13,934
That's OK, Bill,

210
00:11:13,976 --> 00:11:16,684
You know what? There's a limit.

211
00:11:16,725 --> 00:11:18,185
There's a limit.

212
00:11:19,478 --> 00:11:21,856
To the machine, You can only
get three hundred dollars out,

213
00:11:21,897 --> 00:11:24,733
Could you move that, please?
That bag,

214
00:11:24,775 --> 00:11:27,525
- You're kidding,
- No, I'm not kidding,

215
00:11:27,567 --> 00:11:29,777
- I feel bad,
- You should,

216
00:11:29,819 --> 00:11:31,988
You should feel
really bad and ashamed,

217
00:11:32,029 --> 00:11:33,489
It's,

218
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:41,035
- Hold on,
- Forget it,

219
00:11:41,077 --> 00:11:43,830
- Just hold on a second,
- You know what? Forget it,

220
00:11:43,872 --> 00:11:45,954
It's pathetic.

221
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:50,876
"Mater equals money. " I mean,
give me a fucking break.

222
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:56,503
All the world loves a winner,

223
00:11:58,255 --> 00:12:00,174
You know why
they love the winner?

224
00:12:02,176 --> 00:12:05,009
Because they think
he knows something,

225
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:08,429
I mean, he had to know

226
00:12:10,806 --> 00:12:13,768
So, we admire him,

227
00:12:13,809 --> 00:12:18,561
But the winner doesn't
learn anything from winning,

228
00:12:21,606 --> 00:12:25,815
No, the loser... the loser

229
00:12:25,857 --> 00:12:28,359
Losing teaches you
about yourself.

230
00:12:28,401 --> 00:12:29,736
So, the loser's the winner.

231
00:12:29,778 --> 00:12:32,443
I don't know. I mean,
it's not in actual terms.

232
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:34,487
I'm speaking figuratively.

233
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:41,657
Sorry, Excuse me,

234
00:12:44,494 --> 00:12:47,869
- Good night, Denny,
- May I see you, please?

235
00:12:49,913 --> 00:12:53,583
The gentleman in 205
left this for you,

236
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:55,916
Oh, Huh,

237
00:12:59,086 --> 00:13:01,797
Wow, That was nice,

238
00:13:08,842 --> 00:13:12,471
GUS: Ann, thanks
for the happy ending. Bill.

239
00:13:16,889 --> 00:13:18,391
Nice card,

240
00:14:23,475 --> 00:14:24,809
Django?

241
00:14:26,976 --> 00:14:29,145
Django? Hey, hey, hey!

242
00:14:29,186 --> 00:14:31,981
Sweetie-pie?

243
00:14:32,023 --> 00:14:33,399
Dja...

244
00:14:35,273 --> 00:14:37,108
LEE:
I know what they say.

245
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:39,485
I know what they say
about me...

246
00:14:39,527 --> 00:14:42,196
my colleagues...

247
00:14:42,238 --> 00:14:44,782
and my family.

248
00:14:44,823 --> 00:14:47,490
I don't... fucking movies.

249
00:14:47,532 --> 00:14:51,161
OK, let's fucking go,

250
00:14:51,202 --> 00:14:53,121
Fucking movies!

251
00:14:53,163 --> 00:14:57,331
Fucking overpaid, fucking
unhappy childhood fuckers,

252
00:14:57,372 --> 00:15:00,083
Fucking movie fucking fuckers,

253
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:02,794
Let's go! Somebody...
Jesus, buddy!

254
00:15:02,836 --> 00:15:05,878
Uh, do you think somebody else
could go?

255
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:08,964
Maybe one of us could
fucking cross the street?

256
00:15:09,006 --> 00:15:10,841
Fucking movie cop!

257
00:15:10,883 --> 00:15:13,093
Hey, fucking movie cop!

258
00:15:13,135 --> 00:15:15,843
Could I maybe
fucking cross the street?

259
00:15:15,885 --> 00:15:19,889
Francesca Davis, Fuck,

260
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:23,017
Yes, He's gonna get... what?
Dehydrated? OK,

261
00:15:23,059 --> 00:15:28,144
Yes, Yeah, I understand,

262
00:15:36,066 --> 00:15:37,776
Hello, Yeah, hi,

263
00:15:37,817 --> 00:15:39,819
I did that,

264
00:15:39,861 --> 00:15:42,322
and... and I gave him
some water, yeah,

265
00:15:42,364 --> 00:15:45,614
and I was just hoping
that Dr, Green could come by,

266
00:15:45,656 --> 00:15:48,659
and, uh, and give him
a quick look,

267
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:52,742
Oh, he is?

268
00:15:52,784 --> 00:15:55,492
Oh, I see, Uh,

269
00:15:55,533 --> 00:15:57,744
Yeah?

270
00:15:57,786 --> 00:16:01,081
Well, if... you know,
I just... I just, uh,

271
00:16:01,122 --> 00:16:02,749
want to make sure
he's not gonna die,

272
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:04,292
you know, or anything,

273
00:16:04,334 --> 00:16:07,584
Um, so if you could,
that would be great,

274
00:16:07,626 --> 00:16:10,087
Right, heh heh, Yeah,

275
00:16:10,128 --> 00:16:12,381
Uh, that's fantastic,

276
00:16:12,422 --> 00:16:15,214
Yes, I will see you then,

277
00:16:15,297 --> 00:16:18,008
Yes, What? The address?

278
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:19,843
Oh, Oh, my address, Oh, yeah,

279
00:16:19,885 --> 00:16:21,762
I guess you'd need that,
wouldn't you? Heh heh,

280
00:16:35,228 --> 00:16:37,313
Hi,

281
00:16:37,355 --> 00:16:39,315
I know,
You know, I can't really talk,

282
00:16:39,357 --> 00:16:42,235
I'm going into a store,
Can I call you back?

283
00:16:44,237 --> 00:16:46,361
OK,

284
00:16:46,403 --> 00:16:49,739
Oh, really?

285
00:16:49,781 --> 00:16:51,950
Oh that'd be...
that's... that's great,

286
00:16:51,992 --> 00:16:54,244
I'm... I'm glad,

287
00:16:54,285 --> 00:16:56,410
You met Gus?

288
00:16:56,451 --> 00:16:59,413
Where? Wow,
Yeah, well, there's a guy,

289
00:16:59,496 --> 00:17:02,416
who could change your life,
you know?

290
00:17:08,252 --> 00:17:09,545
So, I'm gonna get the dress,

291
00:17:09,586 --> 00:17:10,796
- Oh, good, Great,
- Yeah,

292
00:17:10,838 --> 00:17:13,882
LINDA: Mm-hmm. Sure.

293
00:17:13,924 --> 00:17:16,841
Yeah. I was, um, fat...

294
00:17:16,882 --> 00:17:19,677
overweight, and very short...

295
00:17:19,719 --> 00:17:23,222
and, um, I hadn't
gone through puberty.

296
00:17:23,264 --> 00:17:26,889
So, yeah, I mean, I looked,
you know... I did not look...

297
00:17:26,931 --> 00:17:29,434
like I would've liked
to have looked in high school.

298
00:17:29,475 --> 00:17:31,932
Yeah, surely I would've
changed my social status.

299
00:17:31,974 --> 00:17:33,809
I still would. Heh heh. Yeah.

300
00:17:33,851 --> 00:17:35,891
Treat myself,

301
00:17:35,933 --> 00:17:37,393
So, that's five there,

302
00:17:37,435 --> 00:17:39,520
Oh, great, Thank you very much,

303
00:17:40,813 --> 00:17:42,356
- OK,
- Excellent, Thank you,

304
00:18:22,718 --> 00:18:25,426
Hey, you came, I thought
you were coming later,

305
00:18:25,468 --> 00:18:26,552
No,

306
00:18:26,594 --> 00:18:30,348
Hey, How are you, man?
Good to see you,

307
00:18:30,389 --> 00:18:34,101
The house is open, guys,
if you want to,

308
00:18:34,143 --> 00:18:37,602
Oh, Hi, Dee,

309
00:18:37,644 --> 00:18:39,979
Good to see you,
Thank you for coming,

310
00:18:41,773 --> 00:18:43,107
Good,

311
00:18:43,149 --> 00:18:45,357
That guy didn't pay,

312
00:18:45,398 --> 00:18:47,525
Did you pay, sir?

313
00:18:47,567 --> 00:18:49,110
MAN: I did, yes.
Would you like...

314
00:18:49,152 --> 00:18:51,363
No, no, I just... I saw you
come the other way,

315
00:18:51,404 --> 00:18:54,740
and most people were coming,
I'm sorry,

316
00:18:54,782 --> 00:18:58,033
Right in here,
Right there on the sofa,

317
00:18:58,075 --> 00:19:00,202
Oh, boy,

318
00:19:06,497 --> 00:19:09,166
What else was in the brownies
besides chocolate?

319
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:10,789
Um,

320
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:12,415
- Hash?
- Yeah,

321
00:19:12,457 --> 00:19:13,959
Aw, come on, man,

322
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,208
No, My wife
brought it back from London,

323
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,669
We made the brownies
for my friend's fortieth...

324
00:19:18,752 --> 00:19:21,129
So, what'd you do,
leave it out for him to eat?

325
00:19:21,171 --> 00:19:23,131
No, no, I know,

326
00:19:23,173 --> 00:19:24,466
it was right here
on this counter,

327
00:19:24,508 --> 00:19:26,006
I didn't think
he could jump that high,

328
00:19:26,048 --> 00:19:29,218
He's got little legs like a,

329
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:32,346
All this... he ate all this,

330
00:19:32,388 --> 00:19:34,764
It's so much better than pot,
right?

331
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:36,389
- Uh...
- Aw, no, no, no,

332
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:38,140
You don't understand,

333
00:19:38,182 --> 00:19:41,519
I haven't smoked that in years,
so, you know what I'm saying?

334
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,104
Goddamn,

335
00:19:43,145 --> 00:19:45,937
When I was in my twenties,
this guitar player and I,

336
00:19:45,979 --> 00:19:48,189
would make up all these lyrics
while he played,

337
00:19:48,231 --> 00:19:49,983
and our songs would end up,

338
00:19:50,024 --> 00:19:52,819
with all these fucked-up
rhyme schemes,

339
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:56,069
Heather, Heather, I'm sorry,
Is he going to be all right?

340
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:58,989
Oh, he's going to be fine,
He's going to be fine,

341
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:01,491
So, uh,

342
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,159
you going to throw that out?

343
00:20:09,663 --> 00:20:10,998
Look, you liked it,

344
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,541
and you've told me
you haven't liked things,

345
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:14,999
You liked it, Man, listen,

346
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,208
you're not going to pursue
any more meetings...

347
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,585
because
this is what I want to do.

348
00:20:17,626 --> 00:20:20,504
I'm serious, OK?

349
00:20:20,546 --> 00:20:24,300
Hey, listen. Could you, like...

350
00:20:25,381 --> 00:20:27,633
It's better now,
It's a lot better now,

351
00:20:27,675 --> 00:20:28,759
Ed and I,

352
00:20:28,801 --> 00:20:30,011
We've been
beefing up the scenes,

353
00:20:30,052 --> 00:20:31,470
And that whole thing
you mentioned...

354
00:20:31,512 --> 00:20:32,889
I agree with you...
about me being in it.

355
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:34,181
I'm not going to do it.

356
00:20:34,223 --> 00:20:37,724
Even if they ask about it,
we're not going to build it in.

357
00:20:37,765 --> 00:20:40,059
I figure, you know,
in the long run...

358
00:20:40,101 --> 00:20:41,728
it's probably a good thing,

359
00:20:41,769 --> 00:20:46,062
me trying to establish myself
as a writer instead of an actor,

360
00:20:46,104 --> 00:20:48,982
Like Pinter. You know, Pinter,
he was an actor.

361
00:20:49,024 --> 00:20:51,439
He started off as an actor,

362
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,816
He still acts, occasionally.

363
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,611
All right, this shit
is cyclical, you know that?

364
00:21:05,196 --> 00:21:08,950
All right, don't.
Don't, don't, don't.

365
00:21:08,992 --> 00:21:10,160
I got it,

366
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:12,662
OK, Thank you,

367
00:21:24,254 --> 00:21:26,378
If you stop telling me
that that letter makes sense,

368
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:28,255
you can throw up all you want,
How about that?

369
00:21:28,297 --> 00:21:29,840
Tch, Yeah, Aw,

370
00:21:29,882 --> 00:21:31,300
Do you know her?

371
00:21:31,342 --> 00:21:34,178
- Ahem, Who?
- Carl's wife,

372
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:36,052
Nuh-uh,

373
00:21:36,093 --> 00:21:38,804
That's kind of funny, because
I've heard things, actually,

374
00:21:38,846 --> 00:21:41,432
Yeah. Yeah.
A couple of them.

375
00:21:41,474 --> 00:21:43,935
- Hey, how are you doing?
- Uhh,

376
00:21:43,976 --> 00:21:46,059
Hey, Fran, listen,
I want you to meet...

377
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,144
Frannie, It's Lucy Morgan,
L, A, Magazine,

378
00:21:48,186 --> 00:21:50,480
- I'm sorry, I...
- The Sedona piece,

379
00:21:50,521 --> 00:21:52,357
Oh, my God, Yes, Oh, wow,

380
00:21:52,398 --> 00:21:54,651
Wow, You changed your hair
or something?

381
00:21:54,691 --> 00:21:57,192
Yeah, How do you know Cal?

382
00:21:57,234 --> 00:21:59,694
- Uh, we...
- It was a dinner.

383
00:21:59,736 --> 00:22:01,571
Yeah.

384
00:22:01,613 --> 00:22:03,281
Excuse me,

385
00:22:05,906 --> 00:22:07,741
Hey,

386
00:22:08,742 --> 00:22:10,244
Hi,

387
00:22:10,285 --> 00:22:13,872
Is it... is it upstairs,
or is it in there?

388
00:22:13,914 --> 00:22:15,079
God,

389
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,122
- Oh, this is wrong,
- No,

390
00:22:17,164 --> 00:22:19,083
- I'm overdressed,
- You look,

391
00:22:19,124 --> 00:22:22,086
- I wasn't sure what,
- It's on the roof,

392
00:22:22,127 --> 00:22:23,254
Where's Carl?

393
00:22:23,295 --> 00:22:25,461
He's not here yet,
I just, um,

394
00:22:25,545 --> 00:22:27,672
- We should go up and,
- OK,

395
00:22:27,713 --> 00:22:28,673
- Wow,
- You OK?

396
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:30,087
Yeah,

397
00:22:30,128 --> 00:22:31,421
You know,

398
00:22:31,463 --> 00:22:33,924
No, You look great,

399
00:22:33,966 --> 00:22:35,673
Well,

400
00:22:35,714 --> 00:22:37,967
You know, I have to admire you
for your belief,

401
00:22:38,008 --> 00:22:39,844
in this project,
but the reality...

402
00:22:39,885 --> 00:22:41,637
is a whole different thing
altogether.

403
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:43,013
It's all marketplace shit,

404
00:22:43,055 --> 00:22:44,473
And I don't think that
this is a good role for you...

405
00:22:44,515 --> 00:22:45,721
so don't even push that.

406
00:22:45,763 --> 00:22:47,306
When does this article
come out?

407
00:22:47,348 --> 00:22:49,225
In a couple of months,

408
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:51,102
Well, you call me,

409
00:22:52,979 --> 00:22:55,812
if you can't get any answers
out of this guy,

410
00:22:55,854 --> 00:22:57,564
Thank you.

411
00:22:57,605 --> 00:22:59,232
Nice to meet you,

412
00:22:59,274 --> 00:23:00,859
Nice seeing you,

413
00:23:02,902 --> 00:23:06,695
Huh?

414
00:23:10,657 --> 00:23:11,867
"Meltzin. "

415
00:23:11,908 --> 00:23:15,200
Name kind of suits him,
Oh, Nicholas,

416
00:23:17,744 --> 00:23:20,747
No, it looks good,
Where'd you get that dress?

417
00:23:20,789 --> 00:23:22,291
- Seaver,
- Where?

418
00:23:22,332 --> 00:23:24,418
On Third, Do you know it?

419
00:23:24,459 --> 00:23:26,292
- Is it good?
- Yeah,

420
00:23:26,333 --> 00:23:29,712
- It was on sale, I like it,
- No, it's,

421
00:23:37,717 --> 00:23:39,051
Oh,

422
00:23:40,178 --> 00:23:41,721
God,

423
00:23:46,097 --> 00:23:48,683
All chromium is not bad,

424
00:23:48,725 --> 00:23:50,518
because
I get Fitness magazine,

425
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,228
I need a drink,

426
00:23:58,648 --> 00:24:00,692
No, I'm saying there's
a lot of good chromiums,

427
00:24:00,734 --> 00:24:02,611
- I read it in a magazine,
- Hey,

428
00:24:02,652 --> 00:24:04,404
Hey, I wouldn't go
to the lengths,

429
00:24:04,446 --> 00:24:06,445
of bathing in bottled water,
that's all I'm saying,

430
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:07,779
I believe what you're saying,

431
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:09,781
- Franny Davis?
- Yeah,

432
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:11,237
Sam Osborne.

433
00:24:12,864 --> 00:24:15,906
- I'm sorry,
- The Duchess of Malfi,

434
00:24:15,947 --> 00:24:18,492
- Birchers,
- Yeah,

435
00:24:18,533 --> 00:24:20,994
I was the lighting guy,

436
00:24:21,036 --> 00:24:24,539
Mmm, Oh, my God, Oh, OK, Yeah,

437
00:24:24,581 --> 00:24:26,163
- Sam Osborne,
- Osborne,

438
00:24:26,205 --> 00:24:27,748
- How are you?
- Nice to see you again,

439
00:24:27,789 --> 00:24:29,875
Oh, you, too, Wow, That's funny,

440
00:24:29,917 --> 00:24:31,001
- Yeah,
- That's...

441
00:24:31,043 --> 00:24:34,588
Do you remember when you said,

442
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:37,755
"I feel like a waitress
on vacation"?

443
00:24:37,796 --> 00:24:39,048
Oh, God,

444
00:24:39,089 --> 00:24:42,343
It was, like, just the cutest
thing I've ever heard, and,

445
00:24:42,384 --> 00:24:43,552
I don't know why
that just stuck out,

446
00:24:43,594 --> 00:24:46,135
I don't... yeah,
I just... um, well,

447
00:24:46,177 --> 00:24:48,554
- I was going to go,
- OK,

448
00:24:48,596 --> 00:24:50,932
Jesus, You remember that?

449
00:24:50,973 --> 00:24:52,683
Yeah,

450
00:24:52,725 --> 00:24:54,934
Yeah, I do,

451
00:24:54,974 --> 00:24:57,185
- I got a funny memory that way,
- Oh,

452
00:24:57,268 --> 00:24:59,437
Anyway, hey,
I... I don't want to bug you,

453
00:24:59,479 --> 00:25:00,814
I know you got
lots of people to see,

454
00:25:00,855 --> 00:25:02,899
I just wanted to say
how happy I am for you, and,

455
00:25:02,941 --> 00:25:04,150
Oh, thanks, Thank you,

456
00:25:04,192 --> 00:25:06,650
It's... I always thought
you had something special,

457
00:25:06,691 --> 00:25:08,360
This,

458
00:25:08,401 --> 00:25:12,656
You know, it's just amazing
what you've been able to do,

459
00:25:12,697 --> 00:25:16,031
well, from,

460
00:25:16,114 --> 00:25:17,699
Or, well, yeah,

461
00:25:17,741 --> 00:25:20,202
No, I'm just... I'm... thank you,
Thank you,

462
00:25:20,244 --> 00:25:22,371
Right, Good, Well, hey,

463
00:25:22,412 --> 00:25:24,373
- Cheers, Good to see you,
- Thank you, Cheers,

464
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:26,372
I couldn't "Cheers" you,
I don't have a drink,

465
00:25:26,413 --> 00:25:29,542
but, well, shit,

466
00:25:29,583 --> 00:25:32,419
Ha ha!
Birchers lighting guy,

467
00:25:32,461 --> 00:25:33,546
Birchers,

468
00:25:33,587 --> 00:25:35,920
Get me a...
why don't you come with me?

469
00:25:37,421 --> 00:25:39,173
- Yeah, OK,
- OK,

470
00:25:39,215 --> 00:25:42,426
- Nicholas, Oh, my goodness,
- Oh, God,

471
00:25:42,468 --> 00:25:44,595
- Uhh,
- Let's get you on the sofa,

472
00:25:44,636 --> 00:25:46,678
- Oh, God, did I just...
- Yes, you did,

473
00:25:46,719 --> 00:25:48,638
- Ohh,
- Go slowly,

474
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,095
Ah, Catherine, I'm sorry,

475
00:25:51,137 --> 00:25:52,221
Are you all right?

476
00:25:52,263 --> 00:25:53,889
- Here's some water,
- Oh, thank you so much,

477
00:25:53,931 --> 00:25:57,014
- I feel a little light headed,
- Here, have some water,

478
00:25:57,056 --> 00:25:58,766
- Yeah,
- Drink it,

479
00:26:00,351 --> 00:26:02,103
Yeah?
Are you sure you're all right?

480
00:26:02,145 --> 00:26:05,103
- Mm-hmm,
- Thank goodness,

481
00:26:05,145 --> 00:26:08,189
- I need to ask you something,
- What?

482
00:26:09,649 --> 00:26:12,610
I need you to come back
to New York with me,

483
00:26:12,652 --> 00:26:15,318
Nicholas, I can't...

484
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,488
Catherine, it's that letter,

485
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:19,781
Well, but that was...

486
00:26:19,823 --> 00:26:22,701
I've never had anybody
write me a love letter,

487
00:26:22,742 --> 00:26:24,369
- Never,
- But I just...

488
00:26:24,411 --> 00:26:27,578
No, listen,

489
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:30,831
You're here,
You there just makes sense,

490
00:26:30,873 --> 00:26:35,332
You write the article,

491
00:26:35,374 --> 00:26:37,710
Nicholas, these kind of things...

492
00:26:40,212 --> 00:26:43,215
A moment of inspiration,

493
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:47,216
that's all
anybody ever really wants,

494
00:26:49,719 --> 00:26:50,887
Mmm,

495
00:26:52,305 --> 00:26:54,390
To have an original idea,

496
00:26:54,432 --> 00:26:57,307
to fall in love,

497
00:26:57,348 --> 00:27:00,101
It takes courage,

498
00:27:00,143 --> 00:27:02,604
to surrender these things,

499
00:27:02,645 --> 00:27:05,812
Especially when you have
control issues,

500
00:27:05,854 --> 00:27:07,481
I get that a lot,

501
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:19,573
I know what
they're going to talk about,

502
00:27:19,615 --> 00:27:21,158
when they talk about me,

503
00:27:22,785 --> 00:27:25,659
They're going to talk
about the mustache,

504
00:27:25,701 --> 00:27:29,538
People are so fucking petty,

505
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,286
People say,
"God, what's up with that?

506
00:27:31,328 --> 00:27:33,455
"Like, didn't you know
that Chaplin had it first?"

507
00:27:33,497 --> 00:27:37,164
Yeah! I knew, OK?

508
00:27:41,085 --> 00:27:43,545
It's either the name
of your first pet,

509
00:27:43,587 --> 00:27:46,545
and the first street
that you ever lived on,

510
00:27:46,587 --> 00:27:48,631
or it's your middle name,

511
00:27:48,672 --> 00:27:51,050
and the first street
that you lived on,

512
00:27:51,092 --> 00:27:53,427
Well, which is it?
I think... is it pet?

513
00:27:53,469 --> 00:27:54,595
- Pet,
- It's pet,

514
00:27:54,636 --> 00:27:56,677
So, if it's pet...
all right.

515
00:27:56,719 --> 00:27:59,347
WOMAN: I'm Daisy Bufane.

516
00:27:59,388 --> 00:28:01,307
Daisy Bufane?

517
00:28:01,349 --> 00:28:02,850
Jo Jo Mountainview,

518
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:09,604
I would be Peavey Meander.

519
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:13,024
- What?
- Peavey Meander,

520
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:14,317
Meander,

521
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,817
- Thurston Craddock.
- Hmm.

522
00:28:16,858 --> 00:28:19,027
Uh, Baron Von Hugecock,

523
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:24,282
What?
That's... that was my street,

524
00:28:24,324 --> 00:28:26,532
I lived on
Van Hugecock Avenue,

525
00:28:27,991 --> 00:28:30,452
MAN: The little kid
who lives on Van Hugecock.

526
00:28:30,494 --> 00:28:33,080
FRANCESCA:
Oh, God, where is Gus?

527
00:28:33,122 --> 00:28:35,621
- Save us from this misery.
- Uhh.

528
00:28:35,663 --> 00:28:38,124
CARL:
So, it's your middle name...

529
00:28:38,165 --> 00:28:39,542
- Right.
- first.

530
00:28:39,583 --> 00:28:42,169
CARL: And then... and then...

531
00:28:42,211 --> 00:28:46,421
the name of the street
that you grew up on,

532
00:28:46,462 --> 00:28:48,423
HEA THER: OK.

533
00:28:50,216 --> 00:28:52,593
Lolita...

534
00:28:52,677 --> 00:28:55,009
Honeysuckle.

535
00:29:06,977 --> 00:29:08,186
CALVIN:
All right, I'll open it.

536
00:29:08,228 --> 00:29:11,269
Obviously, everybody,
Gus is not here...

537
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:14,021
so I was thinking,

538
00:29:14,063 --> 00:29:16,855
to pass the time,
why don't we all just kind of,

539
00:29:16,896 --> 00:29:20,358
whoever wants to, stand up
and give our little Gus stories,

540
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,694
Uh, so, let me start off,

541
00:29:22,736 --> 00:29:25,026
I think
my favorite Gus moment,

542
00:29:25,068 --> 00:29:28,613
was when he called me
at 1:20 in the morning...

543
00:29:28,655 --> 00:29:30,699
to ask what
I really thought about him.

544
00:29:30,741 --> 00:29:32,534
WOMAN: What'd you say?

545
00:29:32,576 --> 00:29:33,577
What did I say?
What did I say?

546
00:29:33,618 --> 00:29:37,077
I said,"Well, Gus,

547
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:40,080
"I'm going to think the same
thing at 10. 00 in the morning,"

548
00:29:40,122 --> 00:29:41,874
Then I hung up,

549
00:29:41,915 --> 00:29:43,959
- Whatever.
- Calvin.

550
00:29:44,001 --> 00:29:45,291
Aw,

551
00:29:45,332 --> 00:29:47,793
It's all right, It's all right,

552
00:29:47,835 --> 00:29:50,046
Listen,
let's get down to business.

553
00:29:50,087 --> 00:29:52,131
If someone wants to stand up,
please, feel free.

554
00:29:52,173 --> 00:29:53,257
The floor is open.

555
00:29:53,299 --> 00:29:56,215
MAN, TAPPING GLASS:
All right. I got one, Calvin.

556
00:29:56,257 --> 00:29:57,759
Yes,
that's right, that's right.

557
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:00,386
So, Gus and I... some of you
may not know this...

558
00:30:00,428 --> 00:30:03,097
Gus and I used
to hunt together, all right?

559
00:30:03,139 --> 00:30:06,181
And this one time, we're

560
00:30:06,222 --> 00:30:09,184
and, uh, Gus climbs down,

561
00:30:09,225 --> 00:30:11,853
to relieve himself
in the bushes, OK?

562
00:30:13,021 --> 00:30:15,729
And, uh... it gets funnier.
It gets funnier.

563
00:30:15,771 --> 00:30:17,230
So, uh...

564
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:27,821
Wow. Thank you, man.

565
00:30:27,863 --> 00:30:29,656
I can't tell you
how much that means to me.

566
00:30:29,698 --> 00:30:30,908
I really appreciate that,
you know?

567
00:30:30,949 --> 00:30:32,409
Especially coming
from someone like you,

568
00:30:32,451 --> 00:30:36,911
who writes and acts and directs
and plays the sax,

569
00:30:36,952 --> 00:30:37,912
Originally,
I kind of felt like,

570
00:30:37,953 --> 00:30:39,830
it was really coming after me,
you know?

571
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:41,707
Now I feel like
I'm coming after it,

572
00:30:41,749 --> 00:30:42,833
Perfect,

573
00:30:42,875 --> 00:30:45,291
It's not coming after me,
I'm going to get it,

574
00:30:45,375 --> 00:30:48,669
- Can you grab that sword?
- I'm already on it, man,

575
00:30:48,753 --> 00:30:52,002
It's weird, I was watching
this interview with Al,

576
00:30:52,044 --> 00:30:53,170
- Pacino?
- Yeah,

577
00:30:53,212 --> 00:30:54,712
And he was talking
about the differences,

578
00:30:54,795 --> 00:30:56,212
between stage acting
and film acting,

579
00:30:56,253 --> 00:30:57,672
and he was talking about
how being on stage,

580
00:30:57,713 --> 00:31:00,007
is like being on this high wire,
like, a hundred feet up,

581
00:31:00,049 --> 00:31:01,133
And if you fall,
you're fucked,

582
00:31:01,175 --> 00:31:03,469
but acting in film is like
having the wire on the,

583
00:31:03,511 --> 00:31:04,802
- Ground,
- On the Ground,

584
00:31:04,843 --> 00:31:06,010
Oh, OK, you've heard that,

585
00:31:06,052 --> 00:31:08,471
Yeah, man, working for guys
like you and Carl,

586
00:31:08,513 --> 00:31:10,890
- the writing, just everything...
- Aw, come on, man,

587
00:31:10,932 --> 00:31:12,517
Where is Carl, by the way?
Is he,

588
00:31:12,558 --> 00:31:13,976
He had a party to go to,

589
00:31:14,018 --> 00:31:15,975
Oh, that's right,
Is that that producer guy?

590
00:31:16,017 --> 00:31:17,477
- Gus Delario,
- Oh, OK,

591
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:19,521
That's not too shabby,
Carl owns a tux, huh?

592
00:31:19,562 --> 00:31:20,647
Mm-hmm,

593
00:31:20,689 --> 00:31:23,066
Huh, Not just one of those
shirts with the design on it?

594
00:31:23,108 --> 00:31:25,190
You know, he says
good luck and break a leg,

595
00:31:25,232 --> 00:31:27,109
Thank you, Thank you,

596
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:28,568
Did I tell you about tomorrow?

597
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:30,153
Yeah, Fuck, man,

598
00:31:30,195 --> 00:31:32,155
That should go really good,
Ann? Is that her name?

599
00:31:32,197 --> 00:31:33,281
Yeah, It's a nice name,

600
00:31:33,323 --> 00:31:35,531
I hope so, man,
I've been looking a long time,

601
00:31:35,572 --> 00:31:37,408
Yeah, I hear you,
It's hard, I don't know,

602
00:31:37,449 --> 00:31:39,201
You want to go for a beer
or something?

603
00:31:39,243 --> 00:31:41,328
No, I got to teach a pilates
class, but thank you,

604
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:43,664
FRANCESCA:
Shouldn't we all say grace?

605
00:31:43,706 --> 00:31:46,288
I think you're right,

606
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:50,292
Listen, it's been 45 minutes,

607
00:31:50,376 --> 00:31:54,296
so let's eat,
Everybody dig in,

608
00:31:54,338 --> 00:31:55,712
MAN: Thank you.

609
00:31:55,753 --> 00:31:57,964
FRANCESCA:
Even at a party... bossy, bossy.

610
00:31:58,006 --> 00:32:01,217
CALVIN: You know you love it.
You love it. You know you do.

611
00:32:05,051 --> 00:32:07,637
- Oh!
- Oh!

612
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:11,307
FRANCESCA:
What are you doing? Shit.

613
00:32:12,308 --> 00:32:15,600
" C-C-C-Calvin "

614
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:18,895
I'll get my ball,

615
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:22,774
CALVIN: Uh, everybody, this is
Lee Bright, Carl's wife.

616
00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:23,900
Hi!

617
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,399
Our writer,
Gave us a beautiful script,

618
00:32:25,441 --> 00:32:27,776
- Hi,
- Hi,

619
00:32:27,818 --> 00:32:30,025
Hi, Thank you,

620
00:32:30,066 --> 00:32:33,945
Lee, Lucy Morgan, L, A, Magazine,
I've worked with Carl,

621
00:32:33,987 --> 00:32:37,821
Oh, yeah, That's right, Hi,
How are you? Nice to meet you,

622
00:32:37,863 --> 00:32:40,240
Hi, I'm Lee,

623
00:32:40,282 --> 00:32:42,534
Yeah, Hi, hi,

624
00:32:42,576 --> 00:32:46,702
Hey, can you name all
the countries in Africa, Calvin?

625
00:32:46,744 --> 00:32:49,288
What do you want from me?

626
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:52,041
- I'm not drunk,
- OK, Let's go,

627
00:32:52,082 --> 00:32:54,293
I'm just...
you know, fuck you, man,

628
00:32:54,376 --> 00:32:57,501
- Yeah, let's go,
- He needs to sober up,

629
00:32:57,585 --> 00:33:00,630
All right, Sorry,
Sit down, Sit down,

630
00:33:00,671 --> 00:33:03,215
He needs to fucking sober up,
I mean, come on,

631
00:33:03,257 --> 00:33:05,340
LINDA:
You know what? Enough, No more,

632
00:33:05,381 --> 00:33:08,509
No more drinks, all right?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

633
00:33:08,551 --> 00:33:11,638
No more, Do not drink anything,
Carl's on his way, all right?

634
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:13,306
- Where are you going?
- I'll be right back,

635
00:33:13,348 --> 00:33:16,222
Don't drink
and don't talk to anybody,

636
00:33:16,264 --> 00:33:17,390
No one!

637
00:33:17,432 --> 00:33:19,684
Tch,

638
00:33:26,647 --> 00:33:29,608
Hey, Soledad, Do me a favor,

639
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:31,860
- You're beautiful,
- Oh, thank you,

640
00:33:31,902 --> 00:33:33,654
- You working?
- No, I'm not,

641
00:33:33,695 --> 00:33:35,527
You know,
I left something in here today.

642
00:33:35,569 --> 00:33:37,363
Could you just let me in
for a second?

643
00:33:37,404 --> 00:33:39,156
Of course,

644
00:33:39,198 --> 00:33:41,951
Yeah, Thank you,

645
00:33:42,034 --> 00:33:44,743
Thanks, Gus?

646
00:33:44,785 --> 00:33:47,244
Hello?

647
00:33:49,163 --> 00:33:51,499
Hello?

648
00:33:57,377 --> 00:34:00,004
Oh, my God,

649
00:34:01,214 --> 00:34:03,758
Oh, my God.

650
00:34:07,592 --> 00:34:10,091
LEE: I mean, I'm wearing
a linen suit, for God's sake...

651
00:34:10,132 --> 00:34:12,802
and mascara's
running all over my face...

652
00:34:14,303 --> 00:34:16,260
And I'm the only fucking car
in the parking lot.

653
00:34:17,762 --> 00:34:21,641
It's, late,

654
00:34:21,683 --> 00:34:24,809
Hey, where did you go?

655
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:26,643
Why?

656
00:34:31,398 --> 00:34:33,066
He's what?

657
00:34:33,108 --> 00:34:36,608
OK, OK, look, look, look,

658
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:39,027
We'll call down, and I'll say
I left something in here,

659
00:34:39,111 --> 00:34:41,446
and I came up and I knocked
and he didn't answer, OK?

660
00:34:41,488 --> 00:34:43,198
What? What?
Lee, I don't know what!

661
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,324
- Just wait,
- Fuck!

662
00:34:44,366 --> 00:34:47,449
Wait for what? Oh, my God!

663
00:34:47,491 --> 00:34:50,786
A few hours ago he was alive,
OK? He was really alive!

664
00:34:50,828 --> 00:34:52,454
Oh, man!

665
00:34:52,496 --> 00:34:55,579
Fuck, fuck! Do not touch him!

666
00:34:55,621 --> 00:34:57,123
- Jesus Christ!
- Oh, my God!

667
00:34:57,164 --> 00:34:58,582
Of course he's cold!

668
00:34:58,624 --> 00:35:00,084
CARL: I don't know
ifyou can calculate...

669
00:35:00,126 --> 00:35:04,255
I don't know
if you can quantify...

670
00:35:04,297 --> 00:35:08,256
the effect that would have
on a ten-year-old girl.

671
00:35:08,298 --> 00:35:11,217
I think Lee is like...

672
00:35:11,259 --> 00:35:15,552
Have you ever seen
a dog get hit by a car...

673
00:35:15,594 --> 00:35:18,471
but walk away?

674
00:35:18,513 --> 00:35:22,517
And... there's this impact...

675
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:24,643
and you know
something terrible...

676
00:35:24,685 --> 00:35:26,810
has happened to that dog...

677
00:35:26,852 --> 00:35:28,979
but it walks away...

678
00:35:29,021 --> 00:35:33,150
and it doesn't seem to even
realize the implications...

679
00:35:33,191 --> 00:35:34,484
'cause it just goes on.

680
00:35:34,525 --> 00:35:38,402
But you know
that something terrible...

681
00:35:38,444 --> 00:35:40,821
has happened inside this dog.

682
00:35:40,863 --> 00:35:43,157
LEE:
Why do you think he did it?

683
00:35:43,198 --> 00:35:46,782
Oh, God, I don't know,

684
00:35:46,824 --> 00:35:52,200
It's some weird sex thing,
I don't know,

685
00:35:52,242 --> 00:35:55,200
LEE: No. Not this.

686
00:35:59,121 --> 00:36:01,165
Ohh,

687
00:36:01,206 --> 00:36:03,000
CARL: That's, I think,
what happened to Lee.

688
00:36:03,042 --> 00:36:04,750
It's like... it's like...

689
00:36:04,791 --> 00:36:07,335
She's a dog that got hit by
a car, and she walked away...

690
00:36:07,376 --> 00:36:11,631
and she's still walking, but...

691
00:36:11,672 --> 00:36:13,549
LINDA: I don't know.
I guess he was really sad.

692
00:36:13,591 --> 00:36:15,882
CARL: Some very, very
important things...

693
00:36:15,924 --> 00:36:18,635
inside her are damaged.

694
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:26,056
LEE: Oh.

695
00:36:26,139 --> 00:36:27,974
Jesus.

696
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:35,604
CARL: So... my wife and I
were having trouble...

697
00:36:35,687 --> 00:36:39,733
and I said I thought
maybe we were in a rut...

698
00:36:39,775 --> 00:36:42,653
and that maybe
we should try something...

699
00:36:42,694 --> 00:36:45,444
to liven things up,
and she said,"Like what?"

700
00:36:45,486 --> 00:36:51,408
And I said like maybe we should
tape ourselves doing it.

701
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:53,786
And she was
completely shocked by this...

702
00:36:53,827 --> 00:36:56,494
and she thought
it was beyond disgusting...

703
00:36:56,535 --> 00:36:58,955
and that was that
for, like, four months.

704
00:36:58,996 --> 00:37:01,374
And then one night,
out of the blue...

705
00:37:01,415 --> 00:37:04,792
she says,"Let's do it. "

706
00:37:04,833 --> 00:37:07,919
Ohh,

707
00:37:07,961 --> 00:37:13,716
So, we get it all set up, and
I'm ready and she's ready,

708
00:37:13,758 --> 00:37:18,051
and, uh, and she has gone out
and bought herself,

709
00:37:18,093 --> 00:37:22,222
a little toy to use
in the video,

710
00:37:22,264 --> 00:37:23,348
Really?

711
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:28,308
Well, it's not a little toy,
It's a... it's a huge,

712
00:37:29,893 --> 00:37:32,058
Fucking, I mean, it was...

713
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:34,185
No one has a... you know, OK,

714
00:37:34,227 --> 00:37:35,976
Well, anyway, I took one look
at this thing,

715
00:37:36,017 --> 00:37:38,270
and I knew
I would not be able to...

716
00:37:39,437 --> 00:37:43,900
I mean, it... I just couldn't...
I couldn't,

717
00:37:47,067 --> 00:37:48,485
I couldn't,

718
00:37:52,322 --> 00:37:54,739
So we haven't,

719
00:37:55,781 --> 00:37:59,034
And, you know,

720
00:37:59,076 --> 00:38:03,163
you can't come back
from something like that,

721
00:38:03,247 --> 00:38:07,248
I don't know whether
she lost respect for me,

722
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:13,004
or I lost respect for myself,
but something was lost,

723
00:38:15,128 --> 00:38:17,255
HEATHER:
What are you going to do?

724
00:38:17,297 --> 00:38:19,841
CARL: I have no idea.

725
00:38:19,883 --> 00:38:23,678
I mean, I know professionally,
I'm gonna go back to teaching.

726
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,093
I always loved teaching.

727
00:38:25,135 --> 00:38:26,219
- Really?
- Yeah.

728
00:38:26,261 --> 00:38:30,015
CARL: Never learned a thing in
my life, but I love teaching.

729
00:38:30,056 --> 00:38:33,059
The legacy of higher education.

730
00:38:33,101 --> 00:38:36,018
HEATHER: What about your wife?

731
00:38:39,438 --> 00:38:42,608
CARL: Tsk. I...

732
00:38:42,649 --> 00:38:46,108
will hope
that we get over this.

733
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:47,401
HEATHER: Hmm,

734
00:38:47,443 --> 00:38:51,989
CARL: Aside from loving her,
I just really like her.

735
00:38:52,031 --> 00:38:54,740
A lot.

736
00:38:54,781 --> 00:38:57,366
But...

737
00:38:57,408 --> 00:38:59,076
I guess she thinks...

738
00:38:59,118 --> 00:39:03,247
everyone and everything
is against her.

739
00:39:03,289 --> 00:39:06,748
Somehow I just think...

740
00:39:06,789 --> 00:39:09,334
it keeps her from being happy.

741
00:39:15,666 --> 00:39:17,293
Is that your wife?

742
00:39:19,337 --> 00:39:21,214
- Hey!
- Hi,

743
00:39:21,255 --> 00:39:22,840
HEATHER: I'm with Dr, Green,

744
00:39:22,882 --> 00:39:26,424
CARL:
This is... Heather, this is Lee,

745
00:39:26,466 --> 00:39:29,427
- Django, he was sick,
- Django ate the brownies,

746
00:39:29,469 --> 00:39:31,012
- Yeah,
- He's OK,

747
00:39:31,054 --> 00:39:33,139
- He's fine now,
- We put him to bed,

748
00:39:33,181 --> 00:39:34,680
CARL: Are you OK?

749
00:39:36,681 --> 00:39:39,768
Um, the,

750
00:39:39,809 --> 00:39:43,980
they found Gus
in his hotel room,

751
00:39:44,022 --> 00:39:46,063
He's... he's dead,

752
00:39:46,104 --> 00:39:49,024
He's...

753
00:39:49,066 --> 00:39:50,984
HEATHER: I should go.

754
00:39:51,026 --> 00:39:54,279
CARL: OK, OK, Thank you,
Thank you, Thank you for that,

755
00:39:54,321 --> 00:39:55,694
HEATHER: Yeah.

756
00:39:56,695 --> 00:39:59,490
Hey, OK?

757
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:04,827
OK, OK,

758
00:40:06,077 --> 00:40:09,038
He... he's dead,

759
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,706
Oh,

760
00:40:10,748 --> 00:40:13,668
Oh, sweetie pie, OK,

761
00:40:13,709 --> 00:40:15,625
Um,

762
00:40:19,921 --> 00:40:21,923
Well,

763
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:31,137
If you ever left me,
I would die,

764
00:40:31,179 --> 00:40:35,472
I would die, Please don't,

765
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,060
OK,

766
00:41:01,029 --> 00:41:03,615
I just want this day to be over,

767
00:41:13,664 --> 00:41:17,165
Mmm,

768
00:41:23,212 --> 00:41:25,587
Yeah, Let it out,

769
00:41:25,628 --> 00:41:27,046
OK,

770
00:41:43,727 --> 00:41:47,060
- Happy birthday,
- Thanks,

771
00:41:49,021 --> 00:41:50,397
CARL: Mmm,

772
00:41:52,941 --> 00:41:55,524
LEE: Hi,

773
00:41:55,566 --> 00:41:57,776
Did you have any
interesting dreams last night?

774
00:41:57,818 --> 00:42:02,031
CARL:
Um, no, Back to normal,

775
00:42:02,072 --> 00:42:03,866
LEE: Oh,

776
00:42:03,908 --> 00:42:06,240
CARL: I had an afro,

777
00:42:07,325 --> 00:42:08,868
LEE: Huh?

778
00:42:13,206 --> 00:42:15,747
LEE: I really don't know
what you should do...

779
00:42:15,789 --> 00:42:17,165
when you're in love
with someone.

780
00:42:17,207 --> 00:42:20,335
I know that you're thinking
about them all the time.

781
00:42:20,376 --> 00:42:23,379
You want to be with them
and see things with them.

782
00:42:23,421 --> 00:42:26,588
I think it's impossible.
It's an ideal to just think...

783
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:30,296
that you can actually
be kind all the time...

784
00:42:30,338 --> 00:42:33,883
and never be disappointed
in them or by them.

785
00:42:33,925 --> 00:42:40,386
It's hard. I mean, it's like
the dream is short-lived.

786
00:42:40,428 --> 00:42:46,056
CARL: You've got
to keep hoping that...

787
00:42:50,102 --> 00:42:52,687
that there's more.

788
00:42:54,771 --> 00:42:56,897
FRANCESCA:
You know, you always...

789
00:42:56,939 --> 00:42:58,982
It's when
you least expect it...

790
00:42:59,024 --> 00:43:02,152
that something
kind of pops up, literally.

791
00:43:02,194 --> 00:43:04,196
He just was...
appeared, kind of...

792
00:43:04,238 --> 00:43:06,195
Um, so...

793
00:43:06,237 --> 00:43:07,822
And nice that it's somebody...

794
00:43:07,863 --> 00:43:11,659
that I knew
a really long time ago.

795
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:15,868
And, clearly, you know,
paid attention to me...

796
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:18,913
before I was, you know, blond.

797
00:43:20,957 --> 00:43:22,250
So, that makes it nice...

798
00:43:22,291 --> 00:43:24,001
but I think
that it's just fate...

799
00:43:24,043 --> 00:43:26,209
and it's kind of, um...

800
00:43:26,251 --> 00:43:29,212
I don't know. And today, just
negative ions in the air...

801
00:43:29,254 --> 00:43:33,174
bringing good fortune
and... and, yeah.

802
00:43:33,216 --> 00:43:35,298
Yeah.

803
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:37,968
Sam Osborne.

804
00:43:51,979 --> 00:43:53,981
CAL VIN: I think,
you know, with Lucy...

805
00:43:54,022 --> 00:43:55,938
she's a good listener,
like I said...

806
00:43:55,980 --> 00:44:00,776
but she's also, you know,
she's teaching me stuff.

807
00:44:00,818 --> 00:44:04,487
She comes from a nice family.
Her parents are still together.

808
00:44:04,529 --> 00:44:05,903
She got three-four
brothers and sisters...

809
00:44:05,945 --> 00:44:08,448
and they're
a real close-knit family.

810
00:44:08,489 --> 00:44:11,822
It's just the opposite
of where I had come from.

811
00:44:11,905 --> 00:44:15,156
I don't know. Honestly,
I don't know what it is.

812
00:44:15,197 --> 00:44:18,117
I mean, I gotta just kinda go
off my gut right now...

813
00:44:18,159 --> 00:44:20,327
and just see what feels right.

814
00:44:20,369 --> 00:44:21,829
And right now,
when I'm with Lucy...

815
00:44:21,871 --> 00:44:24,539
man, it just feels right.

816
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:05,483
Catherine,

817
00:45:05,524 --> 00:45:07,860
Nicholas,

818
00:45:07,943 --> 00:45:10,237
You're here,

819
00:45:10,279 --> 00:45:11,864
I am,

820
00:45:11,906 --> 00:45:14,740
I wasn't sure,

821
00:45:14,782 --> 00:45:17,575
Neither was I...

822
00:45:17,617 --> 00:45:19,869
until now,

823
00:45:39,383 --> 00:45:41,134
Mmm,

824
00:45:41,176 --> 00:45:44,012
- Mmm,
- Mmm,

825
00:46:07,022 --> 00:46:10,025
- Did you get that?
- The announcement? No,

826
00:46:14,154 --> 00:46:16,404
- Where you going?
- Oh, Tucson,

827
00:46:16,445 --> 00:46:18,406
Mmm! I'm going to Tucson,

828
00:46:18,447 --> 00:46:19,782
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah,

829
00:46:19,824 --> 00:46:21,033
- You ever been?
- No,

830
00:46:21,075 --> 00:46:22,868
It's supposed to be beautiful,

831
00:46:22,910 --> 00:46:24,161
That's what I hear,
I've never been, either,

832
00:46:25,868 --> 00:46:27,745
- I'll see you on the plane,
- All right,

833
00:46:27,787 --> 00:46:30,415
- Oh, are you Russian?
- No,

834
00:46:30,456 --> 00:46:34,418
No, you're supposed to say,
"Am I rushin' where?"

835
00:46:38,586 --> 00:46:41,506
- That's funny,
- Thanks,

836
00:46:50,095 --> 00:46:52,597
Hi, I'm sorry,
Is this seat taken?

837
00:46:52,639 --> 00:46:55,180
No, no,

838
00:46:55,222 --> 00:46:56,390
Ohh,

839
00:46:56,432 --> 00:46:59,601
Sorry,
I hope this isn't a full flight,

840
00:46:59,643 --> 00:47:01,311
- Yeah, I hope so, too,
- Sorry,

841
00:47:01,353 --> 00:47:03,313
LINDA:
You know, I was ready to go.

842
00:47:03,355 --> 00:47:05,229
I was at the airport,
and I met...

843
00:47:05,271 --> 00:47:08,399
like, in the food court,
I met this guy, um...

844
00:47:08,441 --> 00:47:11,527
and then he sat next to me
on the plane...

845
00:47:11,569 --> 00:47:13,487
and we just hit it off.

846
00:47:13,529 --> 00:47:16,404
His name's Arty, and we just...

847
00:47:16,446 --> 00:47:20,241
He just made me laugh.
He's really funny and sweet...

848
00:47:20,283 --> 00:47:23,161
and, um, sort of open.

849
00:47:23,202 --> 00:47:26,953
We just talked the whole time,
the whole flight.

850
00:47:26,995 --> 00:47:28,246
ARTY:
She laughed in a way...

851
00:47:28,288 --> 00:47:32,496
that made me feel like
she saw me.

852
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:36,706
I blew off
meeting... meeting Ann...

853
00:47:36,748 --> 00:47:40,293
but we ended up spending
the weekend together.

854
00:47:43,129 --> 00:47:46,171
And she's terrific.

855
00:47:46,212 --> 00:47:49,215
LINDA: It was amazing.
We just had an amazing time.

856
00:47:49,257 --> 00:47:51,259
It was definitely...

857
00:47:51,301 --> 00:47:53,303
It was like out of a movie.

858
00:48:02,351 --> 00:48:05,934
" Do something real "

859
00:48:05,976 --> 00:48:10,606
" Sidewalks chasing,
citizens racing "

860
00:48:10,647 --> 00:48:14,068
" Do something real "

861
00:48:14,109 --> 00:48:18,152
" Bloodhounds closing in
on opposing men "

862
00:48:18,194 --> 00:48:20,321
" Do something real "

863
00:48:26,074 --> 00:48:29,077
" Do something real "

864
00:48:29,118 --> 00:48:34,165
" Crows like rats
like cats on vacation "

865
00:48:34,207 --> 00:48:37,415
" Do something real "

866
00:48:37,457 --> 00:48:41,670
" You've been scrapped,
I'm trapped at the station "

867
00:48:41,711 --> 00:48:45,128
" Small claims courts,
community snorts "

868
00:48:45,170 --> 00:48:48,173
" It's fine
when it's so concealed "

869
00:48:48,215 --> 00:48:49,424
" Do something real "

870
00:48:49,466 --> 00:48:52,678
" Extra special happiness "

871
00:48:52,719 --> 00:48:56,387
" Defined
by an endless field "

872
00:48:56,428 --> 00:48:59,390
" Of nothing real "

873
00:49:05,142 --> 00:49:08,646
" Do something real "

874
00:49:08,688 --> 00:49:13,021
" Crap stripe exits,
examiners expect it "

875
00:49:13,063 --> 00:49:16,480
" Do something real "

876
00:49:16,522 --> 00:49:21,026
" Plot of rockets,
holy ghost markets "

877
00:49:21,068 --> 00:49:22,820
" Do something real "

878
00:49:44,002 --> 00:49:47,877
" Small claims courts,
community snorts "

879
00:49:47,919 --> 00:49:52,173
" It's fine
when it's so concealed "

880
00:49:52,215 --> 00:49:55,132
" Extra special happiness "

881
00:49:55,173 --> 00:49:58,885
" Defined
by an endless field "

882
00:49:58,927 --> 00:50:01,763
" Of nothing real "

883
00:50:08,142 --> 00:50:12,938
This is, like,

884
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:16,188
When we know
who the killer is,

885
00:50:16,230 --> 00:50:18,357
I know,
The audience doesn't know yet,

886
00:50:18,399 --> 00:50:20,067
But I know,

887
00:50:21,319 --> 00:50:23,863
And this is where you see me
put the pieces together.

888
