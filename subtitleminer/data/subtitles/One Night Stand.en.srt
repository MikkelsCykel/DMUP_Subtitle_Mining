00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Hello.
My name is Max.

2
00:00:29,551 --> 00:00:31,550
I'm 35.
And I have 2 kids.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,999
And I'm married to a beautiful women.

4
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:37,341
I work in the commercial advertising industry.

5
00:00:37,383 --> 00:00:39,749
I'm a commercial director.

6
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:42,043
Fairly successful.

7
00:00:42,693 --> 00:00:44,547
What am I saying?
I'm really successful.

8
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,468
My commercials win awards in Europe.

9
00:00:47,492 --> 00:00:49,379
Well, enough about me.

10
00:00:49,412 --> 00:00:52,542
Before, I used to work with
my friend. Charlie.

11
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:54,999
I'm in New York for business...

12
00:00:55,042 --> 00:00:57,312
just overnight, so I'll go meet him.

13
00:00:59,682 --> 00:01:00,827
Charlie's gay.

14
00:01:01,633 --> 00:01:03,194
Well, I'm not gay.

15
00:01:03,234 --> 00:01:05,087
Charlie is gay. But...

16
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,349
and he recently found out
that he's HIV positive.

17
00:01:09,567 --> 00:01:11,902
We haven't seen each other in 5 years.

18
00:01:11,935 --> 00:01:13,429
I live in Los Angeles.

19
00:01:13,471 --> 00:01:15,859
He lives in New York.
I'll tell you...

20
00:01:15,902 --> 00:01:18,750
when we were in New York together...

21
00:01:18,782 --> 00:01:20,604
we hung... I mean...

22
00:01:20,637 --> 00:01:21,882
we had...

23
00:01:21,918 --> 00:01:24,437
then I was considered the most
promising director...

24
00:01:24,477 --> 00:01:25,939
in the lower east side.

25
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:27,888
Well...

26
00:01:28,988 --> 00:01:31,159
anyway, I still consider him
my best friend.

27
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:34,294
Five years ago
we had a big fight and...

28
00:01:35,322 --> 00:01:37,013
over a work thing and...

29
00:01:37,978 --> 00:01:40,280
we haven't spoken since, you know?

30
00:01:42,073 --> 00:01:44,342
Stupid, it's just so stupid.

31
00:01:45,401 --> 00:01:47,408
But you know how pride can be...

32
00:01:48,121 --> 00:01:50,574
he didn't call me to tell me
that he was sick.

33
00:01:50,615 --> 00:01:52,077
His lover calls me.

34
00:01:54,103 --> 00:01:55,052
Anyway...

35
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,710
so, I'm a little nervous.

36
00:01:59,351 --> 00:02:00,462
We'll see how it goes.

37
00:03:11,046 --> 00:03:13,435
Okay, now, now accelerate
out of that move.

38
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:15,323
Okay, good.

39
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,171
- How's it going?
- Good.

40
00:03:58,014 --> 00:04:00,184
- How's I.A.?
- It's all right.

41
00:04:00,221 --> 00:04:02,774
You married a model.
Drive a Porsche.

42
00:04:02,813 --> 00:04:04,471
No. I don't drive a Porsche.

43
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,306
You hanging around, max?

44
00:04:43,604 --> 00:04:46,287
Kevin is an alarmist, by the way.

45
00:04:46,324 --> 00:04:47,436
Everything's fine.

46
00:04:47,476 --> 00:04:50,290
Nothing's happened, yet.
Nothing may happen.

47
00:04:52,563 --> 00:04:55,792
Nobody knows anything,
so if you don't mind not...

48
00:04:55,826 --> 00:04:57,036
telling anybody else because...

49
00:04:58,193 --> 00:04:59,141
Charlie.

50
00:04:59,698 --> 00:05:01,006
If you need anything...

51
00:05:01,744 --> 00:05:02,987
like what?

52
00:05:05,488 --> 00:05:06,797
Like, you know...

53
00:05:07,887 --> 00:05:11,781
I know that there'll be
medical bills and, and stuff.

54
00:05:11,823 --> 00:05:14,212
Medical bills. Okay.
So, what do I need?

55
00:05:15,854 --> 00:05:17,708
You need some help. Some...

56
00:05:19,181 --> 00:05:20,391
money.

57
00:05:20,429 --> 00:05:22,665
I've good insurance.
I don't need your guilt money.

58
00:05:28,747 --> 00:05:30,689
You make it hard.

59
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:33,186
- You make it hard.
- Where's your sense of humor?

60
00:05:33,227 --> 00:05:35,330
This is New York.
We got it here.

61
00:05:35,369 --> 00:05:36,482
That's all we have.

62
00:05:41,065 --> 00:05:42,210
Still in the closet?

63
00:05:45,513 --> 00:05:47,333
Are you out or in?

64
00:05:47,368 --> 00:05:50,978
- Out of what?
- Are you hiding? Or are you...

65
00:05:51,014 --> 00:05:53,403
- with it?
- When'll you get the point?

66
00:05:53,447 --> 00:05:54,854
Why do you hang around me?

67
00:05:54,886 --> 00:05:56,195
You're getting close to the source.

68
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:58,116
Never. Ever.

69
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:01,018
- "Ever, never, never."
- Never. That's right.

70
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:04,835
I am caught into the nappy
dugout and I am staying there.

71
00:06:04,868 --> 00:06:05,981
That's right.

72
00:06:06,021 --> 00:06:09,280
So defensive! "homophobic"
is what we call that right now.

73
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:11,513
- I'm not being defensive.
- How's your beard?

74
00:06:11,554 --> 00:06:12,764
- I'm not being defensive!
- Your wife?

75
00:06:12,801 --> 00:06:14,460
How is your beard-wife?

76
00:06:16,738 --> 00:06:19,007
- I have pictures.
- Come on.

77
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:20,022
Let's see the pictures.

78
00:06:20,961 --> 00:06:22,204
You have a family.

79
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,687
This is Mimi.

80
00:06:27,711 --> 00:06:29,566
And my daughter saffron.

81
00:06:31,326 --> 00:06:32,635
She's beautiful.

82
00:06:33,854 --> 00:06:35,097
And this...

83
00:06:35,998 --> 00:06:38,550
this is Charlie.

84
00:06:52,762 --> 00:06:53,709
Wow. Thanks.

85
00:07:00,473 --> 00:07:01,815
I may need money.

86
00:07:03,864 --> 00:07:05,009
Probably. I'll let you know.

87
00:07:06,647 --> 00:07:08,054
You do that.

88
00:07:08,086 --> 00:07:09,265
You got it.

89
00:07:19,221 --> 00:07:21,741
This girl is costing
us a million dollars.

90
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,187
With all those helicopter shots...

91
00:07:23,219 --> 00:07:25,772
I don't want helicopters.

92
00:07:25,811 --> 00:07:27,218
And this Claudia Schiffer.

93
00:07:27,251 --> 00:07:28,942
What's her price?

94
00:07:28,978 --> 00:07:31,182
She's too white.
She's too Aryan.

95
00:07:31,218 --> 00:07:34,567
No, she's not Aryan.
She's from Germany.

96
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:35,592
Shut up.

97
00:07:36,305 --> 00:07:38,573
We have an open call.
Bring me everybody.

98
00:07:38,609 --> 00:07:39,536
New faces.

99
00:07:39,568 --> 00:07:41,957
You like any of these women?

100
00:07:42,001 --> 00:07:44,367
You want to bring in
a bunch more.

101
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:46,766
It would be really helpful if...

102
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,555
Cindy Crawford.

103
00:07:48,591 --> 00:07:51,208
She works with herb enough.

104
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:54,445
And also, max,
talk to me about...

105
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:56,365
collections.
The fall collections.

106
00:07:56,397 --> 00:07:58,666
Give me.

107
00:07:58,701 --> 00:08:01,035
The cigarette?

108
00:08:01,644 --> 00:08:03,531
Give. Give.

109
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,227
Bad. Bad.

110
00:08:05,259 --> 00:08:06,884
He doesn't want to smoke.

111
00:08:08,587 --> 00:08:10,593
What time is check-out
in the morning?

112
00:08:11,467 --> 00:08:12,545
12:00. but we must...

113
00:08:12,585 --> 00:08:15,901
be at the airport at 2:00
and there's that...

114
00:08:15,946 --> 00:08:19,044
un-convention thing, so...

115
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:20,193
I'm going to bed.

116
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:24,989
Look! There's Christian Slater.

117
00:08:27,975 --> 00:08:29,381
I like New York.

118
00:08:29,414 --> 00:08:30,909
Do you like New York?

119
00:08:30,951 --> 00:08:32,325
Good night. Take care.

120
00:08:35,301 --> 00:08:36,708
I'll come in then.

121
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,944
Why?

122
00:08:38,981 --> 00:08:40,474
To relax with you and...

123
00:08:41,924 --> 00:08:43,930
no?

124
00:08:43,972 --> 00:08:45,281
- Good night.
- Good night.

125
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:51,286
Good morning, New York.
This is your traffic report.

126
00:08:51,329 --> 00:08:55,584
Stay out of your cars.
The east side's a mess.

127
00:08:55,617 --> 00:08:58,103
Welcome to the united nations
celebration.

128
00:08:59,425 --> 00:09:00,602
Thank you, Mr. Sandpiper.

129
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,455
Join us again soon.
Sorry about the plumbing. Next.

130
00:09:03,488 --> 00:09:06,521
- You're quite busy.
- It's the un celebration, sir.

131
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:09,940
50 years of the un
and what do you get? Chaos.

132
00:09:09,981 --> 00:09:11,389
The airport, sir?

133
00:09:11,422 --> 00:09:13,942
Leave one hour at least.
The traffic is really bad.

134
00:09:13,981 --> 00:09:15,869
You better ring my friends.

135
00:09:15,901 --> 00:09:17,111
905, 906, 907.

136
00:09:17,149 --> 00:09:18,676
The van wyck is extra heavy
this morning.

137
00:09:18,717 --> 00:09:23,058
An overturned tractor tailor
carrying dry goods.

138
00:09:54,997 --> 00:09:58,477
Westbound L.I.E. Is backed up
from van dam to queens midtown.

139
00:09:58,517 --> 00:10:00,621
2 toll booths are out
due to construction.

140
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:04,108
Take the 59th street bridge.

141
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:49,414
You have a black heart.

142
00:10:50,537 --> 00:10:52,903
On you.
Think maybe your pen.

143
00:10:52,937 --> 00:10:53,886
Your shirt.

144
00:10:56,009 --> 00:10:57,951
Oh, shit.

145
00:10:57,993 --> 00:10:59,269
Goodness. Hold on.

146
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:07,300
Thank you.

147
00:11:10,054 --> 00:11:11,461
You should change clothes.

148
00:11:11,494 --> 00:11:15,038
I already checked out hotel
so I've blown that one.

149
00:11:19,587 --> 00:11:20,864
That's closed.

150
00:11:25,986 --> 00:11:26,935
Max.

151
00:11:27,426 --> 00:11:28,408
Karen.

152
00:11:30,018 --> 00:11:30,967
Nice to meet you.

153
00:11:32,546 --> 00:11:35,066
The bathroom's over there.

154
00:11:42,623 --> 00:11:43,571
Shit.

155
00:11:45,311 --> 00:11:47,098
Sorry for the mess.

156
00:11:47,134 --> 00:11:48,508
What mess?

157
00:11:58,076 --> 00:11:59,254
No, I just got in.

158
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,946
It went well.

159
00:12:01,979 --> 00:12:04,826
Are we still on for tonight?

160
00:12:04,859 --> 00:12:05,807
I didn't.

161
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:08,306
There's such a thing
as a wake-up call!

162
00:12:08,347 --> 00:12:10,200
Shut up. What are you doing?

163
00:12:15,577 --> 00:12:18,423
You know these guys.
It's something that...

164
00:12:18,456 --> 00:12:19,950
whatever.

165
00:12:19,993 --> 00:12:21,136
I'll call you back.

166
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:26,220
Thank you.
That was very kind.

167
00:12:26,263 --> 00:12:29,012
I appreciate it.
Is everything okay?

168
00:12:29,045 --> 00:12:30,802
- Not bad news?
- That was my girlfriend.

169
00:12:30,838 --> 00:12:32,244
We were going to
a concert tonight.

170
00:12:32,276 --> 00:12:35,888
- Now she can't make it.
- I'm sorry to hear that.

171
00:12:36,596 --> 00:12:38,003
What was the concert?

172
00:12:38,036 --> 00:12:40,784
Heavy stuff. String quartet.

173
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,600
The Julliard quartet.

174
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:46,056
I'm psychic.

175
00:12:47,314 --> 00:12:50,347
Actually, I read the review
in the times yesterday.

176
00:12:50,386 --> 00:12:52,426
I also saw the tickets
on the sink there.

177
00:12:52,466 --> 00:12:54,320
You like the Julliard?

178
00:12:54,353 --> 00:12:57,897
Brilliant. I tried to buy some
tickets but they were sold out.

179
00:12:58,992 --> 00:13:00,072
I'm jealous.

180
00:13:00,848 --> 00:13:02,734
You'll still go, though, right?

181
00:13:02,767 --> 00:13:04,011
Yes. I'm still going.

182
00:13:04,048 --> 00:13:06,315
- Good.
- I can sell the other ticket.

183
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:07,757
Without a doubt.

184
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,131
Absolutely.

185
00:13:09,165 --> 00:13:10,954
You're leaving town, right?

186
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,102
On my way right now.

187
00:13:12,909 --> 00:13:15,909
Well, thank you very much.

188
00:13:15,949 --> 00:13:17,441
- It was nice meeting you.
- You too.

189
00:13:17,484 --> 00:13:19,306
- All right. Bye-bye.
- Bye.

190
00:13:46,182 --> 00:13:47,873
Did my friends
already check out?

191
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:51,357
I thought you'd left, sir.

192
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:52,891
- Where?
- They were in a hurry.

193
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:55,650
I told them you'd gone to
the airport. A minute ago.

194
00:13:55,684 --> 00:13:57,244
- Thanks.
- Bye-bye, sir.

195
00:14:00,356 --> 00:14:02,330
Excuse me, my friend.
Is it possible?

196
00:14:36,924 --> 00:14:39,193
We're blocked up
for 2 blocks around at least.

197
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:43,925
Sorry, there's nothing I can do
about it. I'm sorry.

198
00:14:43,963 --> 00:14:45,457
So?

199
00:14:45,498 --> 00:14:48,344
We're blocked up
for 25 or 30 minutes.

200
00:14:48,377 --> 00:14:49,359
I don't know what to do.

201
00:14:49,401 --> 00:14:51,768
25 or 30 minutes?

202
00:14:51,801 --> 00:14:53,940
God. Geez.

203
00:14:55,737 --> 00:14:57,941
There's no way
I'll get you there on time.

204
00:14:58,743 --> 00:15:00,019
What about the Williamsburg?

205
00:15:00,055 --> 00:15:04,560
We can't get to the Williamsburg
'cause we got a parade...

206
00:15:04,598 --> 00:15:06,965
so we won't go
to the Williamsburg.

207
00:15:06,998 --> 00:15:10,194
The midtown tunnel's
a few seconds away.

208
00:15:10,229 --> 00:15:11,789
After that, we cruise.

209
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:13,651
I don't know how long
this'll take.

210
00:15:15,636 --> 00:15:17,491
- No, that's okay.
- You want to wait?

211
00:15:17,524 --> 00:15:18,636
No, I don't think so.

212
00:15:18,676 --> 00:15:22,897
Maybe I'll try to find
another street or something.

213
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:24,272
Thanks a lot, anyway.

214
00:19:34,912 --> 00:19:35,991
I love this song.

215
00:19:37,726 --> 00:19:39,287
You like this?

216
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:41,726
You have me figured as a purist.

217
00:19:43,422 --> 00:19:44,349
Well...

218
00:19:44,382 --> 00:19:45,626
maybe.

219
00:19:49,342 --> 00:19:50,290
Two more.

220
00:19:59,962 --> 00:20:00,911
Can we smoke?

221
00:20:06,489 --> 00:20:08,311
Here you go.

222
00:20:08,345 --> 00:20:10,166
So what?

223
00:20:10,201 --> 00:20:11,412
You guys from I.A.?

224
00:20:20,918 --> 00:20:23,373
I thought you said
you were from I.A.

225
00:20:23,414 --> 00:20:25,519
I wasn't going to tell him.

226
00:20:27,509 --> 00:20:28,850
Does it show?

227
00:20:32,212 --> 00:20:33,739
May I have one of those?

228
00:20:37,427 --> 00:20:38,375
Sure.

229
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,948
So, did you check into
another hotel?

230
00:21:23,433 --> 00:21:25,702
So? I mean,
what is with this accent?

231
00:21:27,209 --> 00:21:28,517
Is it french? Is it...?

232
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:30,113
You hear my accent.

233
00:21:30,153 --> 00:21:32,039
Yeah. It's dutch, Holland?

234
00:21:32,072 --> 00:21:33,860
You guessed right. German.

235
00:21:33,895 --> 00:21:34,843
German.

236
00:21:36,199 --> 00:21:37,060
Right.

237
00:21:37,094 --> 00:21:39,461
I came to school over here.

238
00:21:39,494 --> 00:21:41,218
I never went back.

239
00:21:41,254 --> 00:21:42,661
You maintained the accent.

240
00:21:42,694 --> 00:21:45,376
- It's something else.
- You have a light?

241
00:21:45,413 --> 00:21:46,656
Sure.

242
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:49,977
Give me your fucking money.

243
00:21:51,429 --> 00:21:52,377
Okay.

244
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,761
Give me your fucking wallet, man.

245
00:21:53,796 --> 00:21:55,203
- Don't hurt him.
- You can have the money.

246
00:21:55,236 --> 00:21:57,143
- Your wallet.
- Please don't hurt him.

247
00:21:57,186 --> 00:21:59,096
The money's in my pocket.

248
00:21:59,138 --> 00:22:00,698
Do what he says. It'll be okay

249
00:22:00,737 --> 00:22:01,882
come on. All right?

250
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:03,482
Here's the money.

251
00:22:03,521 --> 00:22:05,463
- Be cool.
- Get them fucking beads.

252
00:22:05,505 --> 00:22:07,577
Give me!

253
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:09,339
Give me your beads!

254
00:22:09,376 --> 00:22:10,782
Please don't hurt him.

255
00:22:10,816 --> 00:22:13,849
- Don't do that! Take the beads.
- Charlie! Nice tits.

256
00:22:13,888 --> 00:22:15,927
- Maybe I should fuck your wife.
- Stop!

257
00:22:20,349 --> 00:22:22,738
Kiss me? Get off.

258
00:22:24,733 --> 00:22:26,871
- I'll cut your hands off.
- It's okay.

259
00:22:26,908 --> 00:22:29,112
I'll cut you. Get out of here.

260
00:22:29,149 --> 00:22:30,009
I'm sorry.

261
00:22:30,043 --> 00:22:31,953
Run. Run. Run.

262
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,852
Are you all right?

263
00:22:40,698 --> 00:22:41,645
You all right?

264
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:45,841
It's over.

265
00:22:45,881 --> 00:22:47,637
Let's get this.

266
00:22:51,576 --> 00:22:53,004
Goddamn New York.

267
00:22:57,815 --> 00:22:59,887
We got a robbery suspect.
Male Hispanic.

268
00:23:02,038 --> 00:23:03,979
Wait. You want to report it?

269
00:23:06,356 --> 00:23:07,817
If you want to,
they're right here.

270
00:23:10,228 --> 00:23:11,657
No. Come on.

271
00:23:19,185 --> 00:23:20,396
You'll be all right?

272
00:23:23,185 --> 00:23:25,552
In a while. I'll feel better.

273
00:23:25,585 --> 00:23:27,951
My heart's beating real fast, still.

274
00:23:27,984 --> 00:23:31,180
Do you want to go to bed?

275
00:23:32,304 --> 00:23:33,678
I mean, you...

276
00:23:33,711 --> 00:23:36,133
- I know what you mean.
- You know what I mean.

277
00:23:38,223 --> 00:23:39,499
No, not yet.

278
00:23:40,461 --> 00:23:43,014
Would you like me to sit
with you for a while?

279
00:24:00,554 --> 00:24:02,626
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

280
00:24:03,433 --> 00:24:04,382
Bless you.

281
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:21,149
Do you want one?

282
00:24:29,828 --> 00:24:30,940
Thanks.

283
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:46,136
Here's to life.

284
00:24:48,545 --> 00:24:49,493
To life.

285
00:24:57,597 --> 00:24:59,507
When do you have
to be at JFK?

286
00:25:01,437 --> 00:25:02,385
8:00.

287
00:25:08,155 --> 00:25:10,577
You can take the other bed.

288
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:12,026
No, that's okay.

289
00:25:12,059 --> 00:25:15,223
- Why?
- No, really. I'm going to go.

290
00:25:15,259 --> 00:25:16,469
Where will you go?

291
00:25:18,874 --> 00:25:20,149
To JFK.

292
00:25:37,431 --> 00:25:39,339
Listen, you just saved my life.

293
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:43,217
We're both adults.
We're both married.

294
00:25:43,253 --> 00:25:44,463
It's the least I can do.

295
00:25:51,828 --> 00:25:53,736
I'd like you to stay.

296
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,276
I set the alarm.

297
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,312
See you in the morning.

298
00:26:59,206 --> 00:27:00,797
Don't let it shock you.

299
00:31:09,683 --> 00:31:10,991
Maximilian!

300
00:31:11,026 --> 00:31:12,848
I'm sorry I'm late.

301
00:31:12,882 --> 00:31:15,118
- It's okay.
- Traffic was terrible.

302
00:31:17,362 --> 00:31:18,768
Where are the kids?

303
00:31:18,801 --> 00:31:20,710
At home.
I wanted to come by myself.

304
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,727
- Well, shall I drive?
- Yeah. Sure.

305
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,708
Oh, good. Great.

306
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:27,908
Bad boy, staying an extra night.

307
00:31:36,077 --> 00:31:38,314
Everything was fine at gram's?

308
00:31:38,349 --> 00:31:40,617
Yeah, everything's really good.

309
00:31:40,653 --> 00:31:42,725
Right. Good.

310
00:31:44,011 --> 00:31:45,441
What is that smell?

311
00:31:46,092 --> 00:31:47,498
Do you smell it?

312
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:50,378
It's like there's sharp and sour...

313
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:52,963
wasn't in the car before.

314
00:31:53,003 --> 00:31:54,212
What is that?

315
00:31:54,249 --> 00:31:55,677
I don't know.

316
00:31:59,048 --> 00:32:00,641
It's the cologne
I got from the plane.

317
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:03,816
You know that
cheap shower substitute.

318
00:32:03,848 --> 00:32:05,276
It always... loud.

319
00:32:06,247 --> 00:32:07,425
Poor max.

320
00:32:07,463 --> 00:32:10,528
Must've been really bad
not having a bed to sleep in.

321
00:32:10,566 --> 00:32:12,933
No, it was okay.

322
00:32:12,966 --> 00:32:14,876
I'll sleep better tonight.
That's for sure.

323
00:32:15,846 --> 00:32:17,667
I wouldn't count on it, tiger!

324
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,675
Don't!

325
00:32:19,716 --> 00:32:21,887
Mimi, don't do that!

326
00:32:21,924 --> 00:32:23,648
We could have been killed here.

327
00:32:23,684 --> 00:32:25,113
Warn me the next time
you do that.

328
00:32:26,404 --> 00:32:29,249
Chill out, honey.
Just a little tweak.

329
00:32:29,282 --> 00:32:31,355
I just miss Mr. Puffinstuff.

330
00:32:38,338 --> 00:32:39,743
We're here?

331
00:32:39,776 --> 00:32:41,685
Is anybody home?

332
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,535
Yuck, don't kiss me.

333
00:32:44,576 --> 00:32:45,982
I can. I brought you in this world.

334
00:32:46,016 --> 00:32:48,405
Come here, you. I'll kiss you.
Good to see you.

335
00:32:53,213 --> 00:32:55,122
- You like it?
- Yeah. It's good.

336
00:32:57,021 --> 00:32:58,133
Too spicy for you?

337
00:32:59,293 --> 00:33:00,722
Nope. It's fine.

338
00:33:00,765 --> 00:33:03,219
It's from that
new place in the mall.

339
00:33:03,259 --> 00:33:06,521
- I thought tonight was special.
- Tonight is special?

340
00:33:06,555 --> 00:33:09,522
Now, see, mommy's
very thoughtful, huh?

341
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:11,440
What's thoughtful?

342
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:14,319
A thought, dumbbell.

343
00:33:15,449 --> 00:33:16,877
No violence against women.

344
00:33:16,921 --> 00:33:18,001
Remember?

345
00:33:18,041 --> 00:33:20,179
You have to sleep at night.
Trust me.

346
00:33:24,886 --> 00:33:27,734
You'll think I'm stupid,
but last night...

347
00:33:27,766 --> 00:33:29,174
after I got your message,

348
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:32,523
I couldn't stop thinking about
New York and how violent it is.

349
00:33:32,566 --> 00:33:34,420
I imagined you being mugged.

350
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:37,265
No, come on.

351
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,707
How silly.

352
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:40,650
See, and here
I am safe and sound.

353
00:33:42,611 --> 00:33:44,019
Come on.

354
00:33:44,979 --> 00:33:46,637
- Oscar.
- Come on.

355
00:33:46,674 --> 00:33:48,714
Oscar, get out of there. What?

356
00:33:48,755 --> 00:33:50,576
What do you smell on daddy?

357
00:33:52,754 --> 00:33:55,176
- Oscar?
- Go to your bowl.

358
00:33:55,218 --> 00:33:57,039
What is it, boy?

359
00:33:57,073 --> 00:33:59,047
- Wonder what he smells on you?
- Cut it out.

360
00:33:59,856 --> 00:34:01,001
Oscar's getting kind of funky.

361
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,141
Maybe he doesn't like the cologne.

362
00:34:04,175 --> 00:34:05,418
The dog has taste.

363
00:34:05,455 --> 00:34:06,404
Right?

364
00:34:08,942 --> 00:34:12,290
I should just go upstairs
and take a shower.

365
00:34:12,333 --> 00:34:14,951
- No, honey. Eat.
- I know how to take a hint.

366
00:34:14,989 --> 00:34:17,356
Because you smell
doesn't mean anything.

367
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:18,916
It's a everyday thing.

368
00:34:20,972 --> 00:34:22,400
Joke's on dad.

369
00:34:34,184 --> 00:34:37,894
Those were big news
at the un's fiftieth birthday.

370
00:34:37,928 --> 00:34:39,074
Motorcades came.

371
00:34:39,113 --> 00:34:42,658
Motorcades went.
Motorcades backed up...

372
00:34:42,697 --> 00:34:44,866
leaving New Yorkers wondering...

373
00:34:44,902 --> 00:34:47,041
who was sitting behind
the tinted windows.

374
00:35:15,457 --> 00:35:16,406
Oscar out!

375
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:24,219
What do you thinks
bugging Oscar?

376
00:35:24,255 --> 00:35:25,367
Hell if I know.

377
00:35:27,615 --> 00:35:29,469
Maybe he's trying
to tell me something.

378
00:35:33,309 --> 00:35:35,546
Maybe he smells
another bitch on you.

379
00:35:37,309 --> 00:35:38,586
Is that possible?

380
00:35:48,506 --> 00:35:49,619
I must tell you something.

381
00:35:57,785 --> 00:35:59,094
You'll hate me.

382
00:35:59,128 --> 00:36:00,339
I know what you'll tell me.

383
00:36:04,503 --> 00:36:05,932
Was it just once?

384
00:36:08,982 --> 00:36:10,738
Was it more than once?

385
00:36:14,101 --> 00:36:15,530
You've been smoking, right?

386
00:36:18,901 --> 00:36:20,493
Oscar's not stupid, max.

387
00:36:21,268 --> 00:36:23,178
He can smell it on you.

388
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,168
So can I.

389
00:36:28,753 --> 00:36:32,048
The smoke police'll have
to watch you night and day.

390
00:36:32,082 --> 00:36:33,544
Huh, Mr. Sinner?

391
00:36:38,192 --> 00:36:39,304
Let's go to bed.

392
00:36:41,231 --> 00:36:42,954
Almost. Almost.

393
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:45,261
Honey, circles. Circles.

394
00:36:45,295 --> 00:36:46,505
That feels good.

395
00:36:47,501 --> 00:36:49,160
Slower. Come on, slower.

396
00:36:49,198 --> 00:36:51,685
Oh, yeah, gentle. That's it.

397
00:36:51,726 --> 00:36:52,674
Harder.

398
00:36:53,421 --> 00:36:54,501
I'm getting there.

399
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:58,881
Yes. Come on, baby.

400
00:36:58,923 --> 00:37:00,963
I'm almost going to come.

401
00:37:01,003 --> 00:37:04,265
Almost going to come.
Oh, yes. Honey.

402
00:37:04,299 --> 00:37:08,489
No, no, hold still.
Hold still. Yeah. Hold still.

403
00:37:09,258 --> 00:37:10,600
Hold still.

404
00:37:14,058 --> 00:37:15,431
Oh, my god, yes.

405
00:37:15,465 --> 00:37:16,577
I'm coming.

406
00:37:18,472 --> 00:37:20,479
Squeeze my breasts.
Squeeze them.

407
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,468
Squeeze them.

408
00:37:26,918 --> 00:37:28,227
Honey, honey.

409
00:37:28,261 --> 00:37:30,018
You'll wake the kids.

410
00:37:30,054 --> 00:37:32,061
Fuck the kids!

411
00:37:32,101 --> 00:37:34,205
I'm coming. I'm coming.

412
00:37:42,756 --> 00:37:44,184
Was it good for you?

413
00:37:45,154 --> 00:37:46,266
Fantastic.

414
00:37:49,633 --> 00:37:50,910
How about you?

415
00:37:52,354 --> 00:37:53,302
The best.

416
00:37:56,672 --> 00:37:57,620
Honey?

417
00:37:58,592 --> 00:37:59,540
I'm sorry.

418
00:38:03,391 --> 00:38:04,339
You okay?

419
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:06,423
I'm all right.

420
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:11,218
I'm sorry.

421
00:38:14,109 --> 00:38:15,385
I like to rough you up.

422
00:38:20,699 --> 00:38:22,106
I bought a video.

423
00:38:23,546 --> 00:38:24,976
What kind of video?

424
00:38:26,426 --> 00:38:27,856
Guide to lovemaking.

425
00:38:30,265 --> 00:38:33,134
I just thought maybe
we could try something new.

426
00:38:38,424 --> 00:38:40,812
You want to watch some tonight?

427
00:38:43,223 --> 00:38:46,092
Jesus. What'd you do
last night? Is that a bruise?

428
00:38:47,063 --> 00:38:48,011
It's ink.

429
00:38:49,141 --> 00:38:50,090
Ink?

430
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:57,129
It's from my pen.
See, ink bled from my pen.

431
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:03,816
It's... okay.

432
00:39:03,858 --> 00:39:05,287
You've got a black heart.

433
00:39:17,296 --> 00:39:18,244
Good night.

434
00:39:34,124 --> 00:39:35,554
Smoking will kill you.

435
00:39:37,868 --> 00:39:39,777
Smoking will kill you.

436
00:39:41,291 --> 00:39:44,487
Smoking will kill you.

437
00:39:44,522 --> 00:39:46,181
D-m-z productions,
can I help you?

438
00:39:50,345 --> 00:39:52,101
Max, how's it going?

439
00:39:58,664 --> 00:40:00,605
I really wish I could,
but I can't right now.

440
00:40:00,647 --> 00:40:02,305
How was your trip to New York?

441
00:40:02,342 --> 00:40:04,252
You're such a bad boy.

442
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:10,527
The pickle association doesn't
limit itself to pickle workers.

443
00:40:10,565 --> 00:40:12,736
No, sir. Pickles are seasonal.

444
00:40:12,773 --> 00:40:15,675
So we're talking
about an association that...

445
00:40:15,717 --> 00:40:19,491
represents the rights of pickle
and sauerkraut workers...

446
00:40:19,524 --> 00:40:21,943
of the entire
west coast of America.

447
00:40:22,435 --> 00:40:24,801
What do you say we start
on the right track?

448
00:40:24,834 --> 00:40:26,263
Nathan has come up with...

449
00:40:26,306 --> 00:40:29,339
an awareness campaign
that I think is interesting.

450
00:40:29,377 --> 00:40:32,344
That weather guy that wears
a different costume every show?

451
00:40:32,385 --> 00:40:34,207
Send him a pickle suit.

452
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:37,175
Then we send him
a sauerkraut and hot dog suit.

453
00:40:37,216 --> 00:40:39,549
Two suits. Two shows.

454
00:40:40,031 --> 00:40:43,064
We could try
a hot dog association campaign.

455
00:40:43,102 --> 00:40:44,792
Wed sauerkraut to the dog.

456
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:48,277
We find the foremost
hot dog maker in the country.

457
00:40:48,318 --> 00:40:51,186
- Gus. Gus bank.
- We get him to talk about...

458
00:40:51,229 --> 00:40:53,117
how good and
how traditional it is...

459
00:40:53,149 --> 00:40:55,537
to have sauerkraut
with the hot dog.

460
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:57,434
We piggy-back on the dog.

461
00:40:57,467 --> 00:40:58,776
"Everyone loves a dog."

462
00:40:58,810 --> 00:41:01,265
This is a very bad time
for sauerkraut.

463
00:41:01,307 --> 00:41:04,623
I'm the first to admit
it's not designer food.

464
00:41:04,667 --> 00:41:08,440
We want to target the under 21s,
the rock-and-roll...

465
00:41:08,473 --> 00:41:11,342
max will direct the spots.

466
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:14,233
You saw his show reel
and you liked it very much.

467
00:41:14,265 --> 00:41:18,519
Max, you want to toss a few logs
on the campfire here?

468
00:41:20,598 --> 00:41:22,354
The national pickle awards.

469
00:41:23,638 --> 00:41:25,580
And who would get these awards?

470
00:41:25,623 --> 00:41:27,793
Anyone famous who's in a fix.

471
00:41:30,517 --> 00:41:31,945
The British royal family.

472
00:41:35,187 --> 00:41:36,268
John Wayne bobbitt.

473
00:41:39,635 --> 00:41:42,481
I think you'd probably
like to elucidate on that...

474
00:41:42,514 --> 00:41:43,943
a little bit there, max.

475
00:41:45,074 --> 00:41:47,278
"He was caught between..."

476
00:41:47,314 --> 00:41:49,801
"his bun and his sauerkraut."

477
00:41:53,872 --> 00:41:56,109
"It was no big dill."

478
00:42:00,271 --> 00:42:01,580
Speaking frankly...

479
00:42:01,614 --> 00:42:03,883
I'll never put that shit on my reel.

480
00:42:03,918 --> 00:42:05,577
It's not always about art.

481
00:42:05,614 --> 00:42:08,482
Wait a minute.
Just think about the company.

482
00:42:08,524 --> 00:42:09,834
What about the profile?

483
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:12,770
Did we put this hip show
together so I could put...

484
00:42:12,813 --> 00:42:14,721
the green peen on screen?

485
00:42:14,764 --> 00:42:17,927
If it's just about numbers,
fine, go ahead.

486
00:42:17,964 --> 00:42:19,392
You do that. I'm out of here.

487
00:42:21,451 --> 00:42:24,648
What you should do
is try to keep accounts...

488
00:42:24,683 --> 00:42:26,242
like the Armani account.

489
00:42:26,281 --> 00:42:28,037
Now, see, that's impressive.

490
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:33,789
Fucking pickles.

491
00:42:35,656 --> 00:42:38,109
These are the 2 ladies
from Armani.

492
00:42:38,151 --> 00:42:41,184
- Max Carlylse.
- I hear you're a genius.

493
00:42:41,222 --> 00:42:42,913
- Thank you very much.
- That's a good one.

494
00:42:42,951 --> 00:42:44,444
There were supposed to be 50.

495
00:42:44,486 --> 00:42:47,869
There were. I couldn't get
25 of them to shave their heads.

496
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:51,040
George, hang on a second.
Give me one second.

497
00:42:51,076 --> 00:42:52,963
- Excuse me.
- Go pick some more leaves.

498
00:42:52,996 --> 00:42:54,403
These Armani ladies...

499
00:42:54,437 --> 00:42:56,508
are born again hard
about the nipple thing.

500
00:42:56,548 --> 00:42:57,890
- My nipples.
- You have wonderful nipples.

501
00:42:57,924 --> 00:42:59,484
These are my nipples.

502
00:42:59,522 --> 00:43:01,595
- You look marvelous, okay?
- You look absolutely beautiful.

503
00:43:01,634 --> 00:43:02,910
I'll talk to you soon.

504
00:43:02,946 --> 00:43:05,434
I won't talk to
other people, okay?

505
00:43:05,474 --> 00:43:07,295
- You can't leave.
- I won't leave.

506
00:43:07,329 --> 00:43:11,605
Stay in your light.
Such a professional.

507
00:43:11,648 --> 00:43:12,576
Don't patronize me.

508
00:43:12,608 --> 00:43:14,168
I'm a vegetarian.

509
00:43:14,207 --> 00:43:17,655
I've said it 5 times today.
Fish-eating vegetarian.

510
00:43:17,695 --> 00:43:19,287
The dress doesn't
make the woman.

511
00:43:19,328 --> 00:43:21,269
The woman makes the dress.

512
00:43:21,311 --> 00:43:22,968
What's wrong?
Are you on your period?

513
00:43:23,005 --> 00:43:23,988
I'll come back tomorrow.

514
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:26,484
I'll do it tomorrow.
I'll go home.

515
00:43:26,525 --> 00:43:27,932
You can't come back.

516
00:43:28,925 --> 00:43:30,813
What they're really
concerned about is...

517
00:43:30,845 --> 00:43:32,252
how many of their
$4,000 dresses...

518
00:43:32,284 --> 00:43:34,672
will we drag through
potter's field?

519
00:43:44,442 --> 00:43:46,035
The next year was a tough one.

520
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:51,248
Everything in my life seemed
to change at the same time.

521
00:43:51,288 --> 00:43:54,158
There was nothing
I could do except watch.

522
00:43:57,239 --> 00:43:59,147
It was as if I didn't exist.

523
00:44:00,119 --> 00:44:03,466
I could see myself,
and I could hear myself.

524
00:44:04,759 --> 00:44:08,205
But I was detached
from the whole process.

525
00:44:10,612 --> 00:44:12,271
I love my wife.

526
00:44:12,308 --> 00:44:14,511
I adore my kids,

527
00:44:14,548 --> 00:44:17,776
but I wasn't me anymore.

528
00:44:19,251 --> 00:44:20,363
Just wasn't me.

529
00:44:22,290 --> 00:44:23,882
What did I miss?
What did I miss?

530
00:44:24,785 --> 00:44:28,014
I said that frankly I don't
understand the gay thing.

531
00:44:28,049 --> 00:44:32,171
I know we're supposed to be
liberal here in California...

532
00:44:32,207 --> 00:44:33,768
and all, but...

533
00:44:33,807 --> 00:44:35,879
you know,
men are not natural...

534
00:44:35,919 --> 00:44:37,447
grinding away on each other.

535
00:44:37,488 --> 00:44:39,048
But women...

536
00:44:39,087 --> 00:44:40,363
- are natural.
- Are natural.

537
00:44:45,229 --> 00:44:46,570
- Let me ask you a question.
- Yes.

538
00:44:46,605 --> 00:44:48,515
Have you ever kissed
a man before?

539
00:44:51,052 --> 00:44:54,051
I have not kissed a man
in my entire life.

540
00:44:54,091 --> 00:44:55,236
Look at that smile.

541
00:44:57,067 --> 00:44:58,244
Denial. Denial.

542
00:44:58,283 --> 00:45:00,519
But you do like anal sex though?

543
00:45:02,987 --> 00:45:06,662
Given that we both work
in the advertising industry,

544
00:45:06,697 --> 00:45:08,223
I've seen you kiss asses...

545
00:45:08,264 --> 00:45:09,212
and you've...

546
00:45:10,665 --> 00:45:12,901
we've seen me kiss asses.

547
00:45:12,936 --> 00:45:14,343
So that's a yes?

548
00:45:14,376 --> 00:45:17,243
I guess we have equanimity
in that area.

549
00:45:19,815 --> 00:45:23,011
The steaming question is,
have you ever kissed a man?

550
00:45:29,573 --> 00:45:30,947
Get out of here.

551
00:45:31,811 --> 00:45:34,299
Now, does that make me
any less of a man now?

552
00:45:34,339 --> 00:45:35,965
Not in my opinion.

553
00:45:36,932 --> 00:45:40,760
I guess that's a question
that we should pose to Mimi.

554
00:45:42,050 --> 00:45:45,083
Where is that coffee?

555
00:45:48,928 --> 00:45:50,717
Pretty goddamn spectacular...

556
00:45:50,752 --> 00:45:54,974
to be on safari last year
with Marie in the Congo.

557
00:45:55,008 --> 00:45:56,763
In the middle of the jungle,

558
00:45:56,799 --> 00:46:00,791
we could return to our
hotel room, flip on the tele,

559
00:46:00,830 --> 00:46:02,739
get CNN, find out
what was happening...

560
00:46:02,782 --> 00:46:04,308
in the first and second worlds.

561
00:46:05,244 --> 00:46:09,073
Before I book our vacations
in places like that,

562
00:46:09,117 --> 00:46:11,832
I always ask if they,
you know, have CNN.

563
00:46:11,867 --> 00:46:14,256
Most of the places have CNN now.

564
00:46:14,299 --> 00:46:16,917
Actually, not only
do they have CNN,

565
00:46:16,956 --> 00:46:18,133
they have MTV.

566
00:46:20,058 --> 00:46:21,007
I know.

567
00:46:22,777 --> 00:46:24,054
Certain shows are educational.

568
00:46:25,337 --> 00:46:27,704
Television is
the worst fucking thing...

569
00:46:27,737 --> 00:46:30,769
that has ever happened
to America.

570
00:46:32,409 --> 00:46:35,855
You sit there and watch
all these little talk shows.

571
00:46:35,895 --> 00:46:37,782
Talk show after talk show.

572
00:46:37,815 --> 00:46:38,928
You sit there
and you're entertained...

573
00:46:38,967 --> 00:46:41,617
by fucked-up
dysfunctional people.

574
00:46:41,654 --> 00:46:43,247
Then they come along with...

575
00:46:43,286 --> 00:46:46,896
nice little TV news
with 30-second sound bites,

576
00:46:46,933 --> 00:46:49,615
throw in a few
human interest stories.

577
00:46:49,651 --> 00:46:50,732
Nice and cute.

578
00:46:50,772 --> 00:46:53,619
So that all of us
won't take a fucking.45...

579
00:46:53,652 --> 00:46:55,440
and blow our
fucking brains out.

580
00:46:55,475 --> 00:46:58,376
- Don't be so dramatic.
- Isn't that good?

581
00:46:58,418 --> 00:47:01,233
You want to know
what television really is?

582
00:47:01,266 --> 00:47:03,152
It's your paycheck.

583
00:47:03,185 --> 00:47:07,145
Television
is a frontal lobotomy.

584
00:47:10,704 --> 00:47:14,184
Let's hear it for
Joseph Lenin's right-hand man.

585
00:47:14,223 --> 00:47:19,077
Spouting his poet warrior
philosophies about television.

586
00:47:19,117 --> 00:47:20,612
No, thank you.

587
00:47:22,061 --> 00:47:24,778
Dope-smoking man-kissing max.

588
00:47:25,933 --> 00:47:28,616
Hey, tambourine man,
the '60s are over.

589
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:31,816
You know what?

590
00:47:35,339 --> 00:47:36,768
Fuck you.

591
00:47:42,537 --> 00:47:45,220
On that signal...

592
00:47:46,857 --> 00:47:48,743
anybody care for dessert?

593
00:47:48,776 --> 00:47:51,809
We've got bailey's, haagen-dazs.
Your favorite, don.

594
00:47:53,575 --> 00:47:54,851
We have to go in a moment.

595
00:48:02,214 --> 00:48:03,643
That finished the party off.

596
00:48:05,093 --> 00:48:08,441
I thought we'd lighten
things up a bit, you know.

597
00:48:09,412 --> 00:48:11,321
Have a real conversation
for a change.

598
00:48:16,610 --> 00:48:17,886
I don't think so.

599
00:48:19,490 --> 00:48:22,806
Everybody had a great time
until you made it serious.

600
00:48:22,849 --> 00:48:25,215
You have to show
what a deep thinker you are...

601
00:48:25,249 --> 00:48:26,809
and how stupid we are.

602
00:48:26,848 --> 00:48:30,012
Some people are
interested in things...

603
00:48:30,048 --> 00:48:30,975
other than fucking bottled water.

604
00:48:31,008 --> 00:48:32,894
Like your assistant for example

605
00:48:32,927 --> 00:48:34,334
Mickey? What? Come on.

606
00:48:34,367 --> 00:48:36,755
She hangs onto your every word.

607
00:48:38,686 --> 00:48:40,114
What are you talking about?

608
00:48:42,685 --> 00:48:43,961
Are you fucking her?

609
00:48:44,925 --> 00:48:46,037
What?

610
00:48:46,525 --> 00:48:49,393
Somebody has to be getting it,
and it sure ain't me.

611
00:48:52,603 --> 00:48:54,031
She'd like you to fuck her.

612
00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:56,499
Really.

613
00:48:56,539 --> 00:48:58,295
Really. Or what about Marie?

614
00:48:58,778 --> 00:49:01,166
She found you
fascinating suddenly.

615
00:49:01,209 --> 00:49:03,631
Well, yeah. I am fascinating.

616
00:49:03,673 --> 00:49:08,015
Speaking of Marie, maybe Marie
does find me fascinating...

617
00:49:08,057 --> 00:49:11,123
because her husband looked down
your dress all night.

618
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:14,094
- Now it's the dress.
- I like the dress. Great.

619
00:49:14,135 --> 00:49:16,981
No, it's how you wear the dress.

620
00:49:17,014 --> 00:49:21,072
I think you may be
in the minority, because...

621
00:49:21,109 --> 00:49:22,419
to be honest, it's nice to know...

622
00:49:22,454 --> 00:49:25,137
that some men
find me attractive.

623
00:49:25,173 --> 00:49:26,579
You are attractive!

624
00:49:26,612 --> 00:49:28,500
You don't have to expose
your breasts...

625
00:49:28,532 --> 00:49:30,898
to be constantly
fucking endorsed, is all.

626
00:49:30,932 --> 00:49:33,299
I was not...

627
00:49:33,331 --> 00:49:35,696
- did it even dawn on you...
- fuck you.

628
00:49:35,730 --> 00:49:37,137
When you leaned over the table...

629
00:49:37,170 --> 00:49:38,097
fuck you.

630
00:49:38,130 --> 00:49:40,944
That you are exposing
your fucking breasts?

631
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:41,926
You know?

632
00:49:41,969 --> 00:49:43,595
This something that
you work all out?

633
00:49:43,633 --> 00:49:45,421
Is that it?

634
00:49:46,128 --> 00:49:49,128
- You are so f...
- maybe you worked this all out.

635
00:49:49,168 --> 00:49:51,535
You are just so stoned
out of your mind...

636
00:49:51,567 --> 00:49:53,868
because you don't make sense.

637
00:49:53,903 --> 00:49:55,529
- I'll try.
- I don't know...

638
00:49:55,567 --> 00:49:56,581
what you're trying to say.

639
00:49:56,623 --> 00:49:57,831
Listen, listen...

640
00:49:57,869 --> 00:50:02,920
is it possible that when
you buy those low-cut dresses...

641
00:50:02,957 --> 00:50:07,147
that you go there
and you decide on...

642
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:10,660
if a lean to the left or shade
too much of the left side?

643
00:50:10,699 --> 00:50:12,105
No, you don't buy
dresses that way.

644
00:50:12,139 --> 00:50:16,262
If you lean to the right
it shows the little pink area

645
00:51:37,498 --> 00:51:38,774
may I help you, sir?

646
00:51:39,897 --> 00:51:42,897
Yes. I'm looking
for Charlie rivers.

647
00:51:42,937 --> 00:51:44,366
He's right over there.

648
00:51:46,296 --> 00:51:47,670
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

649
00:52:03,028 --> 00:52:03,977
Hey, man.

650
00:52:04,948 --> 00:52:05,897
How you doing?

651
00:52:24,944 --> 00:52:25,893
Good morning, Charlie.

652
00:52:27,344 --> 00:52:28,838
Hi, gentlemen.

653
00:52:30,256 --> 00:52:31,303
How did you sleep?

654
00:52:40,845 --> 00:52:41,793
Here.

655
00:52:54,155 --> 00:52:55,529
I'll give Charlie his bath.

656
00:52:55,563 --> 00:52:57,503
You may prefer to wait outside.

657
00:53:05,672 --> 00:53:06,949
Stick around.

658
00:53:12,870 --> 00:53:14,299
We slept good last night.

659
00:53:22,628 --> 00:53:24,384
It's Vernon. Charlie's brother.

660
00:53:25,508 --> 00:53:26,456
Vernon.

661
00:53:27,652 --> 00:53:30,107
- How you doing?
- How you doing?

662
00:53:30,147 --> 00:53:32,535
Shit. Sorry.
Let's get rid of these.

663
00:53:34,850 --> 00:53:35,798
Oh, boy.

664
00:53:40,545 --> 00:53:42,137
How are things going here?

665
00:53:43,168 --> 00:53:46,550
The doctor gives him a week.
Maybe two.

666
00:53:53,759 --> 00:53:57,140
I hear things are
going great for you.

667
00:53:57,181 --> 00:53:59,123
Charlie said business is good.

668
00:53:59,165 --> 00:54:01,237
- Things are fine.
- That's good.

669
00:54:01,276 --> 00:54:03,448
That's nice to hear.
That's really good.

670
00:54:03,484 --> 00:54:06,778
Being in I.A. Enjoying it.
What a dream that must be.

671
00:54:06,811 --> 00:54:09,560
- I'm doing well.
- Good.

672
00:54:09,595 --> 00:54:12,114
That's great. You meet
any stars? Do you ever?

673
00:54:12,155 --> 00:54:14,642
Probably not.
That's all right.

674
00:54:14,683 --> 00:54:16,591
The last time I saw you...

675
00:54:16,634 --> 00:54:17,778
you know...

676
00:54:17,818 --> 00:54:19,126
is there a bathroom
around here?

677
00:54:20,953 --> 00:54:23,800
There's... well,
you don't use that one.

678
00:54:23,832 --> 00:54:25,240
I think it's down on the left.

679
00:54:25,272 --> 00:54:27,181
Great. Great. Excuse me.

680
00:54:43,444 --> 00:54:45,036
Max, how you doing, buddy?

681
00:54:46,644 --> 00:54:48,399
I'm fine. How are you?

682
00:54:52,658 --> 00:54:55,919
I'm really tired. I can't sleep.

683
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:02,727
How long can you stay?

684
00:55:09,359 --> 00:55:11,747
I know Vern' gave you
the skinny. Okay?

685
00:55:12,878 --> 00:55:15,147
I know it, so...

686
00:55:16,558 --> 00:55:19,077
best thing for you to do is...

687
00:55:19,116 --> 00:55:20,524
I'll be straight with you.

688
00:55:20,557 --> 00:55:22,018
- You be straight with me.
- All right.

689
00:55:22,061 --> 00:55:23,271
You know what's going on.

690
00:55:25,899 --> 00:55:28,517
I'm here to be useful.

691
00:55:28,555 --> 00:55:31,402
Anything you want,
you just ask, and I'll do it.

692
00:55:31,851 --> 00:55:34,272
The first thing you can do
is move this pillow.

693
00:55:34,314 --> 00:55:36,549
Turn it around.
This side is wet.

694
00:55:37,769 --> 00:55:39,656
And pull me over
a little to the left.

695
00:55:41,192 --> 00:55:42,305
Here you go.

696
00:55:42,344 --> 00:55:44,710
Sweating my skull off.

697
00:55:45,769 --> 00:55:47,490
All right. How's that?

698
00:55:47,527 --> 00:55:49,316
Man, such a difference.

699
00:55:49,351 --> 00:55:51,838
Really? You are sweating.

700
00:55:57,766 --> 00:56:00,132
Get me some really good bud.

701
00:56:00,165 --> 00:56:01,572
I should have known.

702
00:56:01,604 --> 00:56:03,677
- It's done.
- Okay.

703
00:56:05,604 --> 00:56:07,327
Did you come alone?

704
00:56:08,259 --> 00:56:09,207
Sure.

705
00:56:10,242 --> 00:56:12,129
Mimi's coming later on.

706
00:56:12,162 --> 00:56:13,590
Mimi's coming?

707
00:56:16,193 --> 00:56:18,746
Must be a lot sicker
than I thought.

708
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:28,282
The traffic sucks.

709
00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:32,114
So by the time
that I want to see the people,

710
00:56:32,157 --> 00:56:35,834
the people I love,
they don't get me at my best.

711
00:56:37,854 --> 00:56:41,149
Sloppy. You know?
I need you to manage it.

712
00:56:41,181 --> 00:56:43,732
You can do it without being
impolite and all that.

713
00:56:43,771 --> 00:56:44,720
All right.

714
00:56:44,764 --> 00:56:46,421
What's the best time
I should visit?

715
00:56:47,931 --> 00:56:49,458
The graveyard.

716
00:56:50,906 --> 00:56:53,241
Right before dawn.
That's when it's really scary.

717
00:56:53,914 --> 00:56:56,728
About 5:30, 5:45.

718
00:56:58,328 --> 00:57:01,045
I shit in my pants
for fear of death.

719
00:57:03,032 --> 00:57:04,690
Be here then, would be nice.

720
00:57:09,046 --> 00:57:10,323
I'll be here.

721
00:57:15,830 --> 00:57:18,578
I realized that
he was going to die.

722
00:57:18,613 --> 00:57:20,205
'Course, I had known
that all along,

723
00:57:20,244 --> 00:57:22,480
but up until that moment,

724
00:57:22,516 --> 00:57:25,483
it was an abstract idea.

725
00:57:25,524 --> 00:57:27,411
Now it was reality.

726
00:57:27,443 --> 00:57:29,809
What I meant was that
Charlie'd be leaving soon...

727
00:57:29,842 --> 00:57:31,663
and he wouldn't come back.

728
00:57:32,466 --> 00:57:35,083
Death is so fucking strange.

729
00:57:35,121 --> 00:57:38,733
Everything in me
that was hollow and false...

730
00:57:38,769 --> 00:57:41,452
seemed so clear, suddenly.

731
00:57:52,558 --> 00:57:54,565
Look at you.

732
00:57:54,606 --> 00:57:57,321
- You're beautiful.
- Start the party.

733
00:57:57,357 --> 00:57:58,764
I've arrived.

734
00:58:02,219 --> 00:58:03,877
It's on the fifth.
Not the third.

735
00:58:03,915 --> 00:58:05,672
The day after tomorrow.

736
00:58:05,707 --> 00:58:08,073
No. It's on the third.

737
00:58:08,107 --> 00:58:10,311
All right, it's the third.

738
00:58:27,015 --> 00:58:30,495
- Max. How you doing?
- Vern. Good to see you.

739
00:58:30,534 --> 00:58:32,422
I'd like you to meet my wife.

740
00:58:37,252 --> 00:58:38,201
There you go.

741
00:58:44,324 --> 00:58:45,665
Hi. How are you?

742
00:59:10,238 --> 00:59:11,798
When's your wife coming in?

743
00:59:13,118 --> 00:59:15,189
Is your wife coming?
Is she?

744
00:59:16,318 --> 00:59:17,561
- When's she get...
- tomorrow.

745
00:59:17,596 --> 00:59:20,084
We should get together
and have dinner.

746
00:59:20,125 --> 00:59:22,873
There's a great place downtown.
You like sushi?

747
00:59:25,114 --> 00:59:26,543
That's good.
Let's do it.

748
00:59:53,047 --> 00:59:56,526
I'm scared because that
list of all the people.

749
00:59:56,565 --> 00:59:59,281
I slept good and I got to call
all those people.

750
01:00:04,244 --> 01:00:06,131
I'm angry because there's
sores in my mouth...

751
01:00:06,162 --> 01:00:08,267
and Kevin won't kiss me anymore.

752
01:00:09,170 --> 01:00:10,795
I'll listen to your heart.

753
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:19,687
- It sounds good.
- Still there?

754
01:00:19,728 --> 01:00:20,359
Still there.

755
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:21,806
Good.

756
01:00:21,839 --> 01:00:23,269
Let's try the lungs.

757
01:00:28,014 --> 01:00:30,053
I need you to breathe
for me a bit.

758
01:00:30,094 --> 01:00:31,206
Deep one.

759
01:00:33,454 --> 01:00:34,730
One more.

760
01:00:36,813 --> 01:00:38,219
One more.

761
01:00:38,253 --> 01:00:41,568
I think I'll go ahead
and go now.

762
01:00:41,611 --> 01:00:43,334
I would.

763
01:00:43,370 --> 01:00:44,832
You want anything
from the store?

764
01:00:44,876 --> 01:00:46,882
One more breath, Charlie.

765
01:00:51,369 --> 01:00:52,929
Some good food?

766
01:00:52,969 --> 01:00:55,652
Some good food or
I don't know, or Carnegie deli.

767
01:00:55,689 --> 01:00:56,801
Good, good.

768
01:00:58,889 --> 01:01:00,775
How about that papaya juice?

769
01:01:00,808 --> 01:01:03,654
Papaya juice.
The enzyme thing.

770
01:01:03,687 --> 01:01:06,404
- That's good for the...
- that's good for your mouth.

771
01:01:09,125 --> 01:01:10,980
Can we put the blue shirt on?

772
01:01:16,164 --> 01:01:19,611
You're kicking ass,
doing a great job for me.

773
01:01:20,963 --> 01:01:23,898
But I'm worried
about you because...

774
01:01:23,939 --> 01:01:26,872
- you're worried about me?
- You don't look happy.

775
01:01:26,914 --> 01:01:29,597
You deserve to be happy.
You spend all your time here.

776
01:01:30,978 --> 01:01:34,043
I want to check his back.
Real slow.

777
01:01:34,081 --> 01:01:36,056
Chris said that you're
anxious and depressed...

778
01:01:36,098 --> 01:01:37,471
and I said, yep.

779
01:01:37,504 --> 01:01:40,537
- Isn't that what you said?
- Anxious and depressed.

780
01:01:40,576 --> 01:01:42,136
You worry about you.
I'll worry...

781
01:01:42,175 --> 01:01:45,339
okay, listen.
All right? Look at me.

782
01:01:45,375 --> 01:01:46,902
Life is short.

783
01:01:48,350 --> 01:01:50,935
The tree huggers are right.
This is not a rehearsal.

784
01:01:50,974 --> 01:01:52,402
This is it.

785
01:01:53,853 --> 01:01:56,722
Okay, man. Good-bye.
I'll see you.

786
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:00,375
How's the breathing level?

787
01:02:00,411 --> 01:02:03,891
It's good. He'll get me
some grass. Is that okay?

788
01:02:03,931 --> 01:02:05,338
It is not okay.

789
01:02:05,371 --> 01:02:06,931
Why? I have
no immunities, anyway.

790
01:02:06,970 --> 01:02:08,214
What'll that do?

791
01:02:08,250 --> 01:02:10,322
It'll be harder
for you to breathe.

792
01:03:24,106 --> 01:03:25,699
Remember me?

793
01:03:28,522 --> 01:03:30,015
It's good to see you.

794
01:03:32,136 --> 01:03:33,248
Happy birthday.

795
01:03:33,289 --> 01:03:34,631
I didn't know
it was your birthday.

796
01:03:34,664 --> 01:03:36,125
Max didn't tell me.

797
01:03:37,096 --> 01:03:39,397
We have 2 beautiful kids.

798
01:03:39,432 --> 01:03:40,859
We couldn't bring them.

799
01:03:40,902 --> 01:03:42,758
I mean, is this okay?

800
01:03:42,791 --> 01:03:44,285
It's really good to see you.

801
01:03:49,542 --> 01:03:51,068
How you doing?

802
01:03:51,110 --> 01:03:54,457
I'll just do something for you.

803
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:55,961
It's your birthday, right?

804
01:03:56,004 --> 01:03:58,622
Who's that talking with Charlie?

805
01:03:58,659 --> 01:04:01,561
- That's Vernon. His brother.
- That's Vernon.

806
01:04:01,603 --> 01:04:05,180
We must go. I won't be able
to come for a few days.

807
01:04:05,218 --> 01:04:06,396
Max'll be here.

808
01:04:06,434 --> 01:04:09,216
I'll be back when I can.
Take care.

809
01:04:14,145 --> 01:04:17,111
Hi, Vernon.
This is my wife, Mimi.

810
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:19,518
Hello, Vernon.
It's a pleasure. Hello.

811
01:04:19,552 --> 01:04:22,366
- Nice to meet you.
- Very nice to meet you.

812
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:24,309
- This is...
- I'm Karen.

813
01:04:24,351 --> 01:04:26,619
Nice to meet you, Karen.

814
01:04:26,654 --> 01:04:28,954
- And, you are...?
- My wife.

815
01:04:28,989 --> 01:04:30,811
Okay. That's what I figured.

816
01:04:30,845 --> 01:04:32,786
It's great you could be here.

817
01:04:32,828 --> 01:04:34,422
Sure. Sure.

818
01:04:37,467 --> 01:04:38,711
Way to go, doc.

819
01:04:39,419 --> 01:04:41,329
So, anybody hungry?

820
01:04:41,371 --> 01:04:44,241
- Listen, no, no.
- Yes, actually. We...

821
01:04:44,283 --> 01:04:46,169
that place we talked about...

822
01:04:46,202 --> 01:04:47,543
remember that sushi...

823
01:04:47,578 --> 01:04:49,104
- I love sushi.
- It's fantastic.

824
01:04:49,145 --> 01:04:50,574
I'm not hungry.

825
01:04:52,505 --> 01:04:55,353
Maybe it was a woman's instinct
or a maternal instinct.

826
01:04:55,385 --> 01:04:57,424
Protecting our kids.
Remember, honey?

827
01:04:57,464 --> 01:04:59,983
I said, "I must sell this house."

828
01:05:00,023 --> 01:05:03,023
I told you, right?
I had this 6th sense.

829
01:05:03,063 --> 01:05:05,713
We sold it right
before the earthquake.

830
01:05:05,749 --> 01:05:07,375
- You had an intuition.
- Exactly.

831
01:05:07,414 --> 01:05:09,682
- I was insistent.
- That's what real estate is.

832
01:05:09,717 --> 01:05:12,716
We sold the house.
At a really good price.

833
01:05:12,756 --> 01:05:14,317
And then the earthquake hit.

834
01:05:14,356 --> 01:05:15,916
The big northridge earthquake.

835
01:05:15,956 --> 01:05:17,581
It totaled the house.

836
01:05:17,620 --> 01:05:19,506
I felt bad for the buyers.

837
01:05:19,539 --> 01:05:21,100
During the earthquake?

838
01:05:21,140 --> 01:05:23,593
After we sold it.

839
01:05:23,634 --> 01:05:26,535
That's beautiful.
Don't you love Japanese food?

840
01:05:26,578 --> 01:05:28,400
They're so pretty. Anyway...

841
01:05:28,434 --> 01:05:31,499
real estate prices plummeted,

842
01:05:31,537 --> 01:05:33,740
and we got our new home,
this beautiful house for...

843
01:05:33,776 --> 01:05:35,434
half the price?

844
01:05:36,112 --> 01:05:37,540
It's gorgeous.

845
01:05:37,583 --> 01:05:40,714
Smart. Housing prices out there
are at their lowest...

846
01:05:40,751 --> 01:05:42,311
since before the gold rush.

847
01:05:42,351 --> 01:05:44,805
With the mud slides,
everybody was afraid to move.

848
01:05:44,845 --> 01:05:47,944
You know the mud slides
were started intentionally?

849
01:05:51,853 --> 01:05:52,801
What?

850
01:05:54,669 --> 01:05:56,707
You can't have
fire hoses up there.

851
01:05:56,747 --> 01:05:58,177
Right, honey.

852
01:06:01,963 --> 01:06:04,232
Such a goof ball. So...

853
01:06:04,266 --> 01:06:07,778
we were tempted.
Tempted to move out there.

854
01:06:07,817 --> 01:06:11,429
I was. It was more difficult
for Karen because of her work.

855
01:06:13,481 --> 01:06:15,553
So... what do you do, Karen?

856
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:19,907
I'm a rocket scientist.

857
01:06:27,879 --> 01:06:29,569
She works for the Fairchild group.

858
01:06:31,237 --> 01:06:34,552
It's a company that design rockets...

859
01:06:34,596 --> 01:06:37,563
for satellite communications systems.

860
01:06:37,603 --> 01:06:39,033
And telephone systems.

861
01:06:40,323 --> 01:06:41,270
Really?

862
01:06:42,275 --> 01:06:45,590
But they closed their west coast
division last year...

863
01:06:45,633 --> 01:06:47,673
so we're still here.

864
01:06:48,833 --> 01:06:51,932
You still live in New York?
What part?

865
01:06:51,969 --> 01:06:53,113
- Upstate.
- Upstate.

866
01:06:54,272 --> 01:06:56,475
We've got a home
outside of Albany.

867
01:06:56,511 --> 01:07:00,308
Oh, Albany.
I've heard of Albany.

868
01:07:00,351 --> 01:07:02,424
Don't we have
a friend in Albany?

869
01:07:06,270 --> 01:07:09,052
We must get back tomorrow,
so I thought...

870
01:07:09,085 --> 01:07:10,546
max, if it's okay with you,

871
01:07:10,589 --> 01:07:12,182
I'll leave you
a couple of numbers.

872
01:07:13,468 --> 01:07:15,508
The cellphone's on here.

873
01:07:15,548 --> 01:07:17,751
I'll give you the home in case...

874
01:07:17,787 --> 01:07:19,195
anything happens with Charlie.

875
01:07:19,227 --> 01:07:21,910
This must be really difficult for you.

876
01:07:21,946 --> 01:07:22,874
What?

877
01:07:22,907 --> 01:07:26,037
Watch my brother die, without
being able to do anything?

878
01:07:27,545 --> 01:07:28,919
It's so sad.

879
01:07:28,953 --> 01:07:31,026
Yep. It is.

880
01:07:31,065 --> 01:07:32,723
It sure is. But...

881
01:07:34,264 --> 01:07:35,474
something to be expected.

882
01:07:38,007 --> 01:07:40,853
You know, with the lifestyle
these guys lead, it's...

883
01:07:40,886 --> 01:07:44,682
if you see someone
playing in a mine field,

884
01:07:44,725 --> 01:07:46,351
you expect to hear
an explosion, right?

885
01:07:47,190 --> 01:07:49,393
It didn't have to happen.

886
01:07:49,429 --> 01:07:51,664
And it didn't
have to happen to him.

887
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:52,649
So stupid.

888
01:07:54,996 --> 01:07:55,889
I'm glad you're here.

889
01:07:55,924 --> 01:07:57,964
I know it means
a lot to Charlie.

890
01:07:58,803 --> 01:08:01,137
It means a lot
to me, too, Vern.

891
01:08:07,186 --> 01:08:08,876
So, what do you say?

892
01:08:08,914 --> 01:08:10,986
How about a toast to Charlie?

893
01:08:14,031 --> 01:08:15,820
- To Charlie.
- Yes. To Charlie.

894
01:08:15,855 --> 01:08:16,902
To Charlie.

895
01:08:25,069 --> 01:08:26,182
I'm fine.

896
01:08:28,109 --> 01:08:30,182
We should start digging into this...

897
01:08:30,221 --> 01:08:32,587
before it gets, what? Warm?

898
01:08:34,475 --> 01:08:36,384
You get it?

899
01:08:36,427 --> 01:08:38,980
Anyway, what do you want?
Do you want tuna?

900
01:08:40,266 --> 01:08:41,608
Cheer me up. Surprise me.

901
01:08:44,906 --> 01:08:47,141
Here we go. Taxi!

902
01:08:48,585 --> 01:08:50,177
- We're sorry.
- That's good timing.

903
01:08:51,465 --> 01:08:54,246
- Perfect.
- This is for you.

904
01:08:54,279 --> 01:08:55,654
You take it. Go ahead.

905
01:08:55,689 --> 01:08:56,734
It's all right.

906
01:08:56,775 --> 01:08:58,781
- You go ahead.
- No, it's all right.

907
01:08:58,823 --> 01:09:00,994
There's another one.
We'll catch that.

908
01:09:01,030 --> 01:09:03,397
- Please.
- Thanks. It was a good time.

909
01:09:03,430 --> 01:09:06,179
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you, too.

910
01:09:06,214 --> 01:09:07,903
It was a real pleasure.

911
01:09:07,940 --> 01:09:09,795
- We have to do it again.
- I hope so.

912
01:09:12,804 --> 01:09:14,462
Good night.

913
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:15,874
Let me get this.

914
01:09:18,755 --> 01:09:20,991
- Night.
- Good night.

915
01:09:38,111 --> 01:09:40,021
God, I wish I had a cigarette.

916
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:09,713
Give him a shot.

917
01:10:19,318 --> 01:10:21,707
It's okay. It's okay.

918
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:31,364
Why don't you speak sentences
instead of generalizations?

919
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:33,472
- You know what?
- No, you know what?

920
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:36,351
See, that's where, that's where...

921
01:12:05,089 --> 01:12:06,812
- morning.
- Hey, max.

922
01:12:07,650 --> 01:12:10,495
It's not much, but I brought you
a little something.

923
01:12:10,528 --> 01:12:13,375
My appreciation for all
you're doing for Charlie.

924
01:12:13,408 --> 01:12:14,521
Thank you.

925
01:12:15,807 --> 01:12:17,945
Just, I mean, really, thank you.

926
01:12:18,847 --> 01:12:22,326
- He's hanging in.
- Great. I'll move on.

927
01:12:22,365 --> 01:12:25,081
See you a bit later.
Thanks, mate.

928
01:13:25,330 --> 01:13:26,409
When'd you get back?

929
01:13:27,408 --> 01:13:28,837
Last night.

930
01:13:40,334 --> 01:13:41,959
I liked your wife.

931
01:13:46,444 --> 01:13:47,874
She liked you, too.

932
01:13:49,645 --> 01:13:51,018
Oh, really.

933
01:13:59,019 --> 01:14:00,447
So, how is he doing?

934
01:14:03,336 --> 01:14:04,765
Not so good.

935
01:14:08,456 --> 01:14:10,365
But he talked a lot.

936
01:14:11,975 --> 01:14:14,691
He told me you came
to visit him last year.

937
01:14:15,654 --> 01:14:17,564
I realized it was that same time.

938
01:14:23,973 --> 01:14:25,630
Same time.

939
01:14:28,133 --> 01:14:30,019
Is this really difficult for you?

940
01:14:31,332 --> 01:14:32,608
No, it's okay.

941
01:14:34,339 --> 01:14:36,760
As far as I'm concerned...

942
01:14:38,754 --> 01:14:40,128
nothing happened.

943
01:14:44,289 --> 01:14:45,237
Exactly.

944
01:14:46,848 --> 01:14:48,222
Nothing happened.

945
01:15:49,588 --> 01:15:50,864
Morning, Charlie.

946
01:15:56,146 --> 01:15:57,574
New shift is here.

947
01:16:02,065 --> 01:16:03,494
How you feeling?

948
01:16:04,945 --> 01:16:06,187
Did you get some sleep?

949
01:16:09,264 --> 01:16:12,198
Kevin is coming at five. Okay?

950
01:16:12,239 --> 01:16:14,213
And I'll be here this afternoon.

951
01:16:47,496 --> 01:16:48,925
Hey, man.

952
01:16:50,535 --> 01:16:53,404
Sorry to wake you up
at dawn, right?

953
01:17:07,492 --> 01:17:09,695
Why are you kissing my...

954
01:17:09,731 --> 01:17:11,325
sister-in-law?

955
01:17:23,328 --> 01:17:26,327
Remember when I came
to New York?

956
01:17:26,367 --> 01:17:27,643
To visit you?

957
01:17:31,487 --> 01:17:32,916
I missed my flight.

958
01:17:41,501 --> 01:17:43,705
So, what should I do?

959
01:17:43,741 --> 01:17:45,496
Life is an orange, max.

960
01:17:47,579 --> 01:17:48,985
What does that mean?

961
01:17:49,019 --> 01:17:50,448
You don't remember that joke?

962
01:17:52,859 --> 01:17:56,688
The young Jewish boy sitting
at the foot of his wise father.

963
01:17:59,097 --> 01:18:02,708
And his father says,
"always remember, son..."

964
01:18:03,737 --> 01:18:05,493
"life is an orange."

965
01:18:07,735 --> 01:18:09,938
He ponders.

966
01:18:09,975 --> 01:18:13,008
He thinks on the meaning
of this phrase his whole life.

967
01:18:16,854 --> 01:18:20,944
About 60 years later,
his father's dying,

968
01:18:20,980 --> 01:18:23,565
and he goes to see him
for the last time...

969
01:18:26,356 --> 01:18:28,844
and his father's slipping away...

970
01:18:30,770 --> 01:18:32,777
and he says,
"what did that mean, pa?"

971
01:18:33,649 --> 01:18:35,537
"What did what mean, son?"

972
01:18:35,570 --> 01:18:39,344
And then he says, "you know
that, that life is an orange."

973
01:18:42,065 --> 01:18:45,227
And with his dying breath,
his father says,

974
01:18:45,264 --> 01:18:47,173
"I haven't a fucking clue."

975
01:18:51,663 --> 01:18:52,611
Right.

976
01:18:55,406 --> 01:18:58,056
You must work out
your shit, max.

977
01:19:05,261 --> 01:19:06,983
That bad stuff
between you and me,

978
01:19:07,019 --> 01:19:09,124
that was a stupid waste of time.

979
01:19:11,338 --> 01:19:14,021
- No, that was...
- I know. I know.

980
01:19:14,059 --> 01:19:16,873
It was me. I was envious.

981
01:19:17,257 --> 01:19:20,573
Envy is a god awful thing.

982
01:19:20,617 --> 01:19:23,203
I was just very...

983
01:19:23,241 --> 01:19:25,858
I was pissed 'cause you left...

984
01:19:25,895 --> 01:19:27,325
and didn't take me with you.

985
01:19:29,734 --> 01:19:31,774
But I couldn't.
I didn't know how.

986
01:19:33,094 --> 01:19:34,818
I know.

987
01:19:34,854 --> 01:19:37,341
I just want things
to be clean between us.

988
01:19:45,188 --> 01:19:46,136
I'm sorry.

989
01:19:49,572 --> 01:19:51,097
It's okay, baby.

990
01:19:52,866 --> 01:19:54,142
It's okay.

991
01:19:59,553 --> 01:20:03,097
This is a lot harder for
my friends than it is for me.

992
01:20:09,663 --> 01:20:11,256
There's something
I must ask you.

993
01:20:14,301 --> 01:20:15,828
Do you want a priest?

994
01:20:17,660 --> 01:20:20,508
You listen to me, okay?
You listen to me right now.

995
01:20:20,540 --> 01:20:22,428
I seen too many people lose...

996
01:20:22,460 --> 01:20:24,500
their courage at the last minute.

997
01:20:25,338 --> 01:20:26,932
I'm not sorry.

998
01:20:29,179 --> 01:20:30,258
I'm frightened.

999
01:20:31,387 --> 01:20:32,695
Frightened.

1000
01:20:34,554 --> 01:20:38,513
But I'm also fascinated...

1001
01:20:38,553 --> 01:20:40,462
about what's next. So...

1002
01:20:43,992 --> 01:20:46,228
thanks, but no, thanks.

1003
01:20:50,966 --> 01:20:51,981
All right.

1004
01:21:05,748 --> 01:21:07,341
Your dad was here.

1005
01:21:28,272 --> 01:21:30,759
I guess that I'll best...

1006
01:21:30,799 --> 01:21:33,667
best remember him
as my kid brother.

1007
01:21:34,317 --> 01:21:36,205
On the beach.

1008
01:21:36,237 --> 01:21:39,783
Dreams of hitting the big time
on Broadway.

1009
01:21:44,492 --> 01:21:48,353
I remember one time
I was coming home from school

1010
01:21:48,394 --> 01:21:51,078
and I got home
and there he was...

1011
01:21:51,114 --> 01:21:53,797
coming out
of our mother's bedroom...

1012
01:21:53,834 --> 01:21:55,622
dressed in one of her outfits.

1013
01:21:57,993 --> 01:22:00,032
And he had lipstick on that day.

1014
01:22:00,072 --> 01:22:02,941
He was definitely
ahead of his time.

1015
01:22:04,871 --> 01:22:08,514
It was his last wish that we
have a celebration of his life

1016
01:22:08,550 --> 01:22:11,267
and that's what we'll do.

1017
01:22:13,510 --> 01:22:16,259
After the service,
we'll have a party.

1018
01:22:16,294 --> 01:22:18,529
It's what he wanted.

1019
01:22:20,068 --> 01:22:23,296
He paid for everything.
That's what we'll do.

1020
01:22:44,159 --> 01:22:45,107
I don't know.

1021
01:22:46,239 --> 01:22:49,086
Who needs a drink?
You want a drink?

1022
01:22:49,118 --> 01:22:51,987
You know, actually, I think
I'll take a little walk.

1023
01:22:53,278 --> 01:22:54,870
I'll be in shortly.

1024
01:26:16,532 --> 01:26:18,441
We should all get pregnant and...

1025
01:26:18,484 --> 01:26:20,011
are you okay?

1026
01:26:21,620 --> 01:26:23,954
Have all these little Charles.

1027
01:26:24,500 --> 01:26:26,222
What's wrong with Karen?

1028
01:26:26,258 --> 01:26:28,462
She's had too much to drink.

1029
01:26:28,497 --> 01:26:30,635
She fell dancing.

1030
01:26:33,521 --> 01:26:34,928
Very strange.

1031
01:26:34,962 --> 01:26:37,513
Let's have little Charles tonight!

1032
01:26:48,079 --> 01:26:49,834
Do you want some of this?

1033
01:27:03,626 --> 01:27:05,187
Still don't look happy, max.

1034
01:27:06,475 --> 01:27:07,587
Do something.

1035
01:27:48,962 --> 01:27:50,369
Hey, can I cut in?

1036
01:27:50,401 --> 01:27:52,124
You want to cut in?

1037
01:27:52,161 --> 01:27:53,917
Dance with this.

1038
01:28:03,360 --> 01:28:05,944
- What are you doing?
- Hopefully dancing.

1039
01:28:05,983 --> 01:28:07,324
Are we dancing?

1040
01:28:07,357 --> 01:28:08,982
Will you dance with me?

1041
01:28:20,891 --> 01:28:22,801
Wait, you're supposed
to dance with me.

1042
01:28:53,684 --> 01:28:55,593
- Are you crazy?
- I'm not crazy.

1043
01:29:54,568 --> 01:29:56,934
I think there's someone.

1044
01:29:56,968 --> 01:29:59,521
I think there's someone
in the house.

1045
01:30:43,775 --> 01:30:46,424
This internet thing...

1046
01:30:46,462 --> 01:30:48,730
it's all a new concept to me.

1047
01:30:48,764 --> 01:30:50,292
It was for me too.

1048
01:30:50,333 --> 01:30:52,852
But once you start,
you can't stop.

1049
01:30:52,893 --> 01:30:54,322
Anything you want to know.

1050
01:30:54,364 --> 01:30:55,890
- It baffles me.
- It's great.

1051
01:30:55,932 --> 01:30:59,226
And you get addicted to it
because you have so much.

1052
01:30:59,259 --> 01:31:01,976
I've been out of touch
but that's where it's at.

1053
01:31:02,011 --> 01:31:04,531
- Nice acreage?
- You can get some good stuff?

1054
01:31:04,570 --> 01:31:06,031
Can you grow marijuana?

1055
01:31:06,074 --> 01:31:08,561
You can grow
anything you want.

1056
01:31:08,601 --> 01:31:11,022
I wonder about people's minds.

1057
01:31:11,064 --> 01:31:12,559
What they can come up with.

1058
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:14,966
Little old me, I can't conceive of it.

1059
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:18,066
Kids use it
instead of the encyclopedia.

1060
01:31:18,104 --> 01:31:19,925
I went to see
Charlie last week.

1061
01:31:19,959 --> 01:31:21,998
Visit the grave.

1062
01:31:22,038 --> 01:31:24,078
Put some flowers down.

1063
01:31:24,118 --> 01:31:25,972
You wouldn't believe the house.

1064
01:31:26,005 --> 01:31:28,787
- What have they done to it?
- It's completely different.

1065
01:31:28,821 --> 01:31:30,381
They did the gardens all over.

1066
01:31:30,421 --> 01:31:32,176
Remember how they
were nice, overgrown?

1067
01:31:32,212 --> 01:31:34,187
Everything's different.

1068
01:31:34,228 --> 01:31:36,594
You don't even
recognize it anymore.

1069
01:31:36,628 --> 01:31:38,416
You go back to a place
that was yours...

1070
01:31:38,452 --> 01:31:39,978
and now it's not.

1071
01:31:40,019 --> 01:31:42,222
The only thing I hear
about the internet thing...

1072
01:31:42,258 --> 01:31:44,167
is what, cyber-sex?

1073
01:31:44,210 --> 01:31:46,599
- Porch is gone.
- The porch is gone?

1074
01:31:46,642 --> 01:31:49,293
They took the porch off.
That was a nice porch.

1075
01:31:49,329 --> 01:31:52,329
They rebuilt it.
Walled it in with glass.

1076
01:31:52,369 --> 01:31:54,472
Garden's changed.
The pool's gone.

1077
01:31:54,512 --> 01:31:57,643
Everything's all manicured.
Precise.

1078
01:32:02,894 --> 01:32:04,040
Stuffed.

1079
01:32:04,078 --> 01:32:05,538
It's good.

1080
01:32:07,789 --> 01:32:09,065
Check, please.

1081
01:32:13,196 --> 01:32:14,342
There you go.

1082
01:32:18,027 --> 01:32:21,125
- Let me get that.
- We'll split it. Here.

1083
01:32:22,666 --> 01:32:23,942
Thank you.

1084
01:32:26,026 --> 01:32:28,894
Want to go down to Soho
and get a drink?

1085
01:32:28,936 --> 01:32:33,028
Got to pick the kids up
in about an hour and a half.

1086
01:32:33,065 --> 01:32:36,130
- Where are they?
- At the movies.

1087
01:32:36,167 --> 01:32:37,575
What are they seeing?

1088
01:32:37,608 --> 01:32:40,160
Something completely unsuitable
for them.

1089
01:32:40,198 --> 01:32:42,053
But max insisted.

1090
01:32:43,142 --> 01:32:44,124
Come on.

1091
01:32:44,166 --> 01:32:46,621
We got to stop treating
them like children.

1092
01:32:46,661 --> 01:32:49,116
They grow up too fast, honey.

1093
01:32:49,157 --> 01:32:50,498
They hear everything in school.

1094
01:32:51,460 --> 01:32:52,736
It's weird.

1095
01:32:53,732 --> 01:32:55,642
What can you do?

1096
01:32:55,684 --> 01:33:00,538
I had... had this weird dream
the other night.

1097
01:33:00,578 --> 01:33:04,472
I was in this hotel and...

1098
01:33:04,513 --> 01:33:07,579
by myself. I didn't know
where I was or anything but...

1099
01:33:07,618 --> 01:33:10,073
sitting there
and the phone rang.

1100
01:33:10,113 --> 01:33:12,958
So I picked it up
and it was Charlie.

1101
01:33:12,991 --> 01:33:16,155
And he says,
"how you doing?"

1102
01:33:16,191 --> 01:33:17,598
"Okay."

1103
01:33:17,631 --> 01:33:19,518
"Don't worry.
Everything's all right."

1104
01:33:19,550 --> 01:33:20,980
"Everything's cool."

1105
01:33:22,271 --> 01:33:23,993
Life's an orange.

1106
01:33:24,029 --> 01:33:26,266
- It is.
- Life is short.

1107
01:33:30,108 --> 01:33:32,825
No, it was cool.
No, it made me feel good.

1108
01:33:35,355 --> 01:33:37,079
You want to take this one?

1109
01:33:37,115 --> 01:33:38,544
- You go ahead.
- You go ahead.

1110
01:33:38,587 --> 01:33:42,383
It's all right.
You're in a hurry. Go ahead.

1111
01:33:42,426 --> 01:33:44,466
It's fine. Go ahead.

1112
01:33:44,506 --> 01:33:47,821
We'll go walk around
and enjoy the fresh air.

1113
01:33:47,865 --> 01:33:49,937
If you can call this fresh air.

1114
01:33:52,184 --> 01:33:53,590
It's better than I.A.

1115
01:33:53,624 --> 01:33:56,079
Well, anything's better than I.A.

1116
01:34:00,470 --> 01:34:02,542
Take care. All right.

1117
01:34:16,596 --> 01:34:17,904
Excuse me.

1118
01:34:17,940 --> 01:34:20,938
You'll bring the kids
to the airport tomorrow?

1119
01:34:20,978 --> 01:34:22,799
All right. The flight's at one.

1120
01:34:22,834 --> 01:34:23,762
I know.

1121
01:34:23,794 --> 01:34:25,866
It was good to see you, max.

1122
01:34:25,905 --> 01:34:27,728
Good to see you too.

1123
01:34:30,544 --> 01:34:33,674
Be make sure the kids
are properly packed.

1124
01:34:33,711 --> 01:34:36,362
Last time you left
half their stuff at your place.

1125
01:34:36,399 --> 01:34:37,893
I'll do it. Good-bye.
