00:00:57,265 --> 00:00:59,358
- Hi, how you doing?
- Hi.

2
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:01,402
You looking for a date?

3
00:01:01,769 --> 00:01:03,566
- No, thanks.
- Okay.

4
00:01:38,606 --> 00:01:41,302
- Do you want a date?
- No, sorry.

5
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:43,969
- You sure?
- I'm sure. Sorry.

6
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:07,157
Would you like to go out?

7
00:02:08,903 --> 00:02:11,463
- No, I'm just driving around.
- Okay.

8
00:03:16,537 --> 00:03:18,402
You change your mind?

9
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:34,380
- You look pretty.
- Thank you.

10
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:38,248
- I like your necklace.
- Thanks.

11
00:03:38,393 --> 00:03:40,486
That's your name? Rose?

12
00:03:41,863 --> 00:03:44,229
- That's a nice name.
- Thank you.

13
00:04:14,195 --> 00:04:15,685
I wasn't really driving...

14
00:04:15,763 --> 00:04:19,460
I wasn't driving around
looking for anything like that.

15
00:04:19,567 --> 00:04:21,592
No? Well, you found me.

16
00:04:22,737 --> 00:04:24,864
You want to just have lunch with me?

17
00:04:24,939 --> 00:04:27,931
That'd be nice,
but I need to make my money.

18
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,520
What?

19
00:05:56,831 --> 00:05:58,890
Come on, it's time to go.

20
00:06:11,979 --> 00:06:13,139
Here.

21
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:53,341
Stefano!

22
00:08:33,521 --> 00:08:34,681
Okay.

23
00:08:42,797 --> 00:08:44,230
That's fine.

24
00:08:44,699 --> 00:08:46,030
Let's go.

25
00:08:46,233 --> 00:08:47,996
Open the computer.

26
00:09:09,724 --> 00:09:12,090
- Where did you say you're from?
- Laroux.

27
00:09:12,193 --> 00:09:13,421
Stefano?

28
00:09:13,661 --> 00:09:14,889
Yes, sir?

29
00:09:26,173 --> 00:09:28,869
- Can I get some earplugs, man?
- Yeah.

30
00:10:16,457 --> 00:10:18,118
Come on. Roll it out.

31
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:48,380
Are you going to be
driving up to the track tonight?

32
00:10:48,456 --> 00:10:52,825
I think I'm going to stay in LA tonight.
I'll go in the morning.

33
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:54,101
Daisy!

34
00:14:29,843 --> 00:14:31,401
No one's there!

35
00:15:47,254 --> 00:15:48,721
Daisy!

36
00:17:14,474 --> 00:17:17,466
Hello. I'm in Room 325.

37
00:17:19,846 --> 00:17:22,212
I might be getting a call soon.

38
00:17:25,151 --> 00:17:28,552
I just wanted you to know
that if somebody calls...

39
00:17:30,357 --> 00:17:32,382
to put the call through.

40
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,424
And she might just come by...

41
00:17:34,494 --> 00:17:38,396
so if somebody named Daisy
comes to the front desk looking for me...

42
00:17:38,531 --> 00:17:40,021
I'm Bud Clay.

43
00:17:41,334 --> 00:17:44,269
You can let her come right up to the room.

44
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,034
Daisy.

45
00:17:52,379 --> 00:17:53,539
Okay.

46
00:17:54,781 --> 00:17:56,248
Bye. Thanks.

47
00:19:12,525 --> 00:19:13,822
Hi, Bud.

48
00:19:15,495 --> 00:19:17,156
I got your note.

49
00:19:20,299 --> 00:19:22,460
I have to use the bathroom.

50
00:20:10,716 --> 00:20:12,513
Can I hug you, Bud?

51
00:20:20,193 --> 00:20:22,093
Can I sit on your lap?

52
00:20:25,364 --> 00:20:27,025
Can I touch you?

53
00:20:32,572 --> 00:20:35,166
You don't want to touch me anymore?

54
00:20:37,743 --> 00:20:40,109
Don't you like me anymore, Bud?

55
00:20:40,713 --> 00:20:42,112
I like you.

56
00:20:44,584 --> 00:20:46,108
Can I hug you?

57
00:20:56,462 --> 00:21:00,057
Remember how, after dinner,
when you were done eating...

58
00:21:00,132 --> 00:21:03,363
you'd always turn sideways in your chair
and pat your thighs...

59
00:21:03,436 --> 00:21:06,132
and I would come and sit on your lap?

60
00:21:07,373 --> 00:21:11,309
You would let me sit there for a long time
and we would kiss.

61
00:21:12,578 --> 00:21:14,102
Remember, Bud?

62
00:21:18,718 --> 00:21:20,652
Please, can I hug you?

63
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,254
Okay.

64
00:21:55,288 --> 00:21:57,756
Missed you. Missed you so much.

65
00:22:03,529 --> 00:22:07,488
I'm thirsty. I'm gonna get a glass of water.
You want some?

66
00:22:09,368 --> 00:22:10,460
No.

67
00:22:45,071 --> 00:22:47,631
I'm sorry. Don't look at me like that.

68
00:22:48,074 --> 00:22:49,905
I know I look ugly.

69
00:22:51,344 --> 00:22:52,709
I'm sorry.

70
00:22:55,014 --> 00:22:57,005
I know I look terrible.

71
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:03,914
I didn't have time to fix myself
before I came over.

72
00:23:04,423 --> 00:23:08,018
I know we haven't seen each other
in such a long time.

73
00:23:08,494 --> 00:23:10,519
I'm sorry I look so bad.

74
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,061
I have to use the bathroom again.
I drank a lot of water before I came here.

75
00:24:22,067 --> 00:24:26,299
I have to take my antibiotics,
but it's for my allergies.

76
00:24:29,575 --> 00:24:32,442
I'm sorry, but I guess
I'm just a little nervous.

77
00:24:33,245 --> 00:24:36,840
Should I go to the store
and get us something to drink?

78
00:24:41,654 --> 00:24:44,589
- Do you remember the last time I saw you?
- Yes.

79
00:24:46,926 --> 00:24:48,826
I don't drink anymore.

80
00:24:51,163 --> 00:24:53,324
I don't drink at all anymore.

81
00:24:53,432 --> 00:24:55,161
That's great, Bud.

82
00:25:01,707 --> 00:25:04,198
I keep a photo of us in my purse.

83
00:25:05,144 --> 00:25:08,944
I look at it every single day.
Do you want to see it?

84
00:25:12,318 --> 00:25:14,286
Remember, my cousin took it...

85
00:25:14,353 --> 00:25:17,550
in front of our house on Bay Street,
the day we moved in?

86
00:25:20,793 --> 00:25:24,456
We're kissing in it. You want to see it?

87
00:25:31,504 --> 00:25:33,369
Isn't it nice, Bud?

88
00:25:38,043 --> 00:25:40,034
It was a long time ago.

89
00:25:44,483 --> 00:25:46,747
I used to love kissing you...

90
00:25:49,154 --> 00:25:50,985
all over your mouth.

91
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:53,219
I love the way you taste.

92
00:25:55,327 --> 00:25:58,262
You're my favorite person
in the whole world, Bud.

93
00:25:58,364 --> 00:26:00,491
I never want to kiss anybody else.

94
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:06,668
- Really, Bud.
- It's not true.

95
00:26:10,776 --> 00:26:12,937
I did. I loved kissing you.

96
00:26:14,613 --> 00:26:17,411
I loved your mouth. I loved the way it tasted.

97
00:26:17,783 --> 00:26:19,341
It's not true.

98
00:26:20,352 --> 00:26:23,719
- I never want to kiss anybody else.
- That's not true.

99
00:26:23,789 --> 00:26:25,017
It is.

100
00:26:25,691 --> 00:26:27,591
You kissed other boys.

101
00:26:29,595 --> 00:26:33,395
Do you remember the time you bought me
the really big chocolate bunny?

102
00:26:33,899 --> 00:26:37,960
It was so big. I ate it in like an hour
and got really sick and threw up.

103
00:26:38,237 --> 00:26:40,102
You kissed me anyway.

104
00:26:40,606 --> 00:26:41,766
I remember.

105
00:26:41,874 --> 00:26:44,035
You used to really like me.

106
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:49,475
I still like you.

107
00:26:53,552 --> 00:26:55,383
I wish you liked me again...

108
00:26:56,722 --> 00:26:57,984
like before.

109
00:26:59,158 --> 00:27:01,285
When you liked me the most.

110
00:27:09,068 --> 00:27:11,559
I liked you the most my whole life.

111
00:27:13,472 --> 00:27:15,838
You're the only person I liked.

112
00:27:16,609 --> 00:27:18,736
- Tell me you love me.
- No.

113
00:27:21,814 --> 00:27:23,679
I missed you so much.

114
00:27:25,451 --> 00:27:29,012
It hurts me when I don't see you
for such a long time.

115
00:27:30,756 --> 00:27:33,281
I just want to hug you. Come here.

116
00:27:35,628 --> 00:27:36,686
No.

117
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,263
I love you so much.

118
00:27:46,772 --> 00:27:48,933
I always loved holding you.

119
00:27:50,442 --> 00:27:52,376
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is.

120
00:27:55,547 --> 00:27:57,105
Kiss me, Bud.

121
00:28:13,899 --> 00:28:16,026
Don't leave.

122
00:28:31,417 --> 00:28:33,351
I missed you so much.

123
00:28:37,022 --> 00:28:38,421
I love you.

124
00:28:39,758 --> 00:28:43,091
Come on, won't you kiss me? Please?

125
00:29:16,562 --> 00:29:18,029
I missed you.

126
00:29:40,986 --> 00:29:42,783
I missed you a lot.

127
00:30:32,538 --> 00:30:34,369
Take off your shirt.

128
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:45,214
But it's so bright in here.

129
00:30:45,617 --> 00:30:47,050
I want to see your body.

130
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:50,646
Can we turn off the light? Please?

131
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:20,011
Can we go under the covers?

132
00:34:19,865 --> 00:34:21,662
You only do this to me?

133
00:34:21,933 --> 00:34:24,424
You only suck my cock, baby?

134
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:31,365
You don't do it with anybody else?

135
00:34:32,377 --> 00:34:35,244
You don't think about doing it
with anybody else?

136
00:34:38,917 --> 00:34:40,680
You like doing it?

137
00:35:03,909 --> 00:35:06,275
You won't suck anybody else?

138
00:35:06,578 --> 00:35:07,772
Never?

139
00:35:08,113 --> 00:35:09,580
Never again?

140
00:35:09,714 --> 00:35:11,204
You promise?

141
00:35:16,421 --> 00:35:18,321
You won't fuck anybody else?

142
00:35:18,423 --> 00:35:19,890
You promise?

143
00:35:22,928 --> 00:35:24,122
Never?

144
00:35:26,231 --> 00:35:28,426
You won't suck anybody else's cock?

145
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,728
Never?

146
00:35:30,068 --> 00:35:32,195
You won't suck anybody else's cock?

147
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:33,828
You promise me?

148
00:35:36,341 --> 00:35:40,334
Why did you suck that guy's cock?
Why did you fuck those guys?

149
00:35:40,846 --> 00:35:42,279
Why did you do that?

150
00:35:42,347 --> 00:35:44,747
Tell me, why did you do that?

151
00:35:46,985 --> 00:35:48,816
Tell me. I saw you.

152
00:35:54,025 --> 00:35:55,856
I saw you fuck them.

153
00:35:56,328 --> 00:35:58,319
Did you know I saw you?

154
00:35:58,430 --> 00:35:59,692
Never?

155
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:04,530
- Why did you let me see that?
- No.

156
00:36:40,638 --> 00:36:44,301
You're a fucking whore. You're a whore.

157
00:36:54,152 --> 00:36:57,849
You fucked them. You fucking asshole.

158
00:37:00,892 --> 00:37:02,723
I hate you so much.

159
00:37:30,688 --> 00:37:32,747
I don't love you anymore.

160
00:37:35,059 --> 00:37:38,187
- It hurts me so much when you say that.
- It doesn't hurt you.

161
00:37:38,262 --> 00:37:39,661
Please don't say that.

162
00:37:39,731 --> 00:37:42,894
I should've never let you come over here.
I'm so stupid.

163
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,092
Why?

164
00:37:44,736 --> 00:37:46,704
I'm so stupid for telling you to come here.

165
00:37:46,771 --> 00:37:48,705
- Bud, I love you.
- You don't love anybody.

166
00:37:48,773 --> 00:37:52,607
- I love you. I want to be with you again.
- I don't want to be with you.

167
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:56,111
- Can't we be a couple again?
- I'll never be with you again.

168
00:37:56,247 --> 00:37:59,683
- Don't say that, Bud.
- I don't trust you anymore.

169
00:38:00,918 --> 00:38:03,011
I don't love you anymore.

170
00:38:03,554 --> 00:38:07,684
I'm sorry, Bud. I'm sorry that that happened.

171
00:38:07,792 --> 00:38:11,387
- You're not sorry.
- I never meant to hurt you, Bud.

172
00:38:13,398 --> 00:38:16,060
I don't understand why you did that.

173
00:38:17,568 --> 00:38:20,867
Why you went with those guys,
I don't understand that.

174
00:38:21,072 --> 00:38:23,506
It was just a party. I was just being friendly.

175
00:38:23,574 --> 00:38:25,633
Why were you talking to those guys?

176
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:28,645
I saw them talk to you.
Why were you talking to them?

177
00:38:28,713 --> 00:38:31,273
I thought they were nice guys, Bud.

178
00:38:31,582 --> 00:38:34,881
- Nice guys?
- I talk to lots of guys at parties.

179
00:38:36,921 --> 00:38:39,856
I didn't want anything from them.
I didn't care about them.

180
00:38:39,924 --> 00:38:41,585
Why did you get high with them?

181
00:38:41,659 --> 00:38:44,025
They just came into the bathroom
and they...

182
00:38:44,095 --> 00:38:46,563
started smoking, and I thought it was pot.

183
00:38:46,631 --> 00:38:48,394
Why did you smoke pot with them?

184
00:38:48,466 --> 00:38:52,732
I was just going to have a little.
I just wanted to get high, Bud.

185
00:38:52,937 --> 00:38:55,906
You were pregnant.
You shouldn't even have been drinking.

186
00:38:55,973 --> 00:38:57,235
I know.

187
00:38:58,176 --> 00:39:00,440
Why do you take drugs? I don't understand.

188
00:39:00,511 --> 00:39:02,342
Because I'm an addict, Bud.

189
00:39:02,447 --> 00:39:05,746
- Why can't you stop taking it?
- I don't want to take them anymore.

190
00:39:05,817 --> 00:39:09,719
Why can't you stop taking drugs?
Why do you have to drink and take drugs?

191
00:39:09,787 --> 00:39:11,584
I don't understand.

192
00:39:12,623 --> 00:39:16,252
You made our baby die. Our baby died.

193
00:39:16,694 --> 00:39:19,993
I'm so sorry. I didn't want it to die.

194
00:39:20,097 --> 00:39:22,964
I didn't want any of it to happen, Bud,
but it did.

195
00:39:23,601 --> 00:39:26,866
- Tell me what happened.
- They just barged in, Bud.

196
00:39:27,672 --> 00:39:31,665
- There was no lock on the door and...
- Why didn't you tell them to leave?

197
00:39:31,776 --> 00:39:34,904
They were standing in front of the door
and started smoking...

198
00:39:34,979 --> 00:39:37,743
and I thought I'd just have a little bit
and then leave.

199
00:39:37,815 --> 00:39:41,114
- And then what happened?
- Then I passed out, Bud.

200
00:39:41,185 --> 00:39:42,277
Oh, my God!

201
00:39:42,353 --> 00:39:44,821
They raped me.
You saw them and you left me there.

202
00:39:44,889 --> 00:39:47,687
No, I saw them with you. I didn't see...

203
00:39:47,792 --> 00:39:51,455
I was unconscious, Bud, and you saw me,
and you didn't help me.

204
00:39:52,497 --> 00:39:54,158
You just left me there.

205
00:39:54,232 --> 00:39:56,962
But I didn't know what to do.
I didn't know what to do.

206
00:39:57,034 --> 00:40:00,162
- Why didn't you help me?
- I didn't know what to do.

207
00:40:00,571 --> 00:40:02,732
You didn't know what to do?

208
00:40:04,642 --> 00:40:05,700
No.

209
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:08,643
Why didn't you help me?
You left me lying there like that?

210
00:40:08,713 --> 00:40:09,839
I don't know.

211
00:40:09,914 --> 00:40:13,213
- I would've helped you, Bud.
- I know.

212
00:40:13,317 --> 00:40:16,252
- I would've helped you.
- I know you would have.

213
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:23,723
I walked away. I saw you in there.
I saw you in the bedroom.

214
00:40:23,861 --> 00:40:25,658
I saw them touching you.

215
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:28,722
I saw them put their hands on you
and touch you.

216
00:40:28,833 --> 00:40:32,200
And you had your clothes on.
They pulled your bra down.

217
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:34,261
They had your pants down.

218
00:40:34,372 --> 00:40:37,000
Then I left. I just kept walking.

219
00:40:37,441 --> 00:40:41,036
And I was walking away to go home.

220
00:40:43,447 --> 00:40:45,881
When I came back,
there was an ambulance there.

221
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:48,111
Why was there an ambulance there?

222
00:40:52,523 --> 00:40:53,922
I was dead.

223
00:40:54,191 --> 00:40:57,126
What do you mean?
I don't understand. Why was there...

224
00:40:57,194 --> 00:40:58,957
I died, Bud.

225
00:41:00,298 --> 00:41:03,233
I got sick. I choked.

226
00:41:04,902 --> 00:41:06,301
And I died.

227
00:41:07,204 --> 00:41:09,729
- I'm sorry.
- You didn't die.

228
00:41:11,042 --> 00:41:13,533
Don't say you're sorry. You didn't die.

229
00:41:14,912 --> 00:41:16,812
I know you didn't die.

230
00:41:17,448 --> 00:41:19,609
You'll be okay, you're just sick.

231
00:41:20,818 --> 00:41:24,049
- I'm not going to be okay, Bud.
- Yes, you are.

232
00:41:24,255 --> 00:41:28,817
Nobody was there and I got sick,
and I threw up, and I choked, Bud.

233
00:41:30,928 --> 00:41:32,657
The ambulance came...

234
00:41:34,265 --> 00:41:36,096
and I was dead, Bud.

235
00:41:37,802 --> 00:41:39,099
I died.

236
00:41:48,112 --> 00:41:49,170
No.

237
00:41:50,170 --> 00:42:00,170
