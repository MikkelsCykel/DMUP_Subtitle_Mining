00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,630
I found Father Carlton
this morning.

2
00:01:45,735 --> 00:01:50,104
He was taken to the hospital,
but he never regained consciousness.

3
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,831
Why was he here?

4
00:01:51,907 --> 00:01:55,603
He had an appointment with
His Eminence this afternoon.

5
00:04:03,775 --> 00:04:06,368
Let's talk about
our beliefs...

6
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,604
and what we can
learn about them.

7
00:04:08,713 --> 00:04:12,308
We believe nature is solid...

8
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:14,644
and time a constant.

9
00:04:14,751 --> 00:04:18,742
Matter has substance,
and time a direction.

10
00:04:18,853 --> 00:04:21,844
There is truth in flesh,
huh,

11
00:04:21,956 --> 00:04:23,948
and the solid ground.

12
00:04:24,059 --> 00:04:27,118
The wind may be invisible,
but it's real.

13
00:04:27,227 --> 00:04:32,492
<i>Smoke, fire, water, light...
they're different,</i>

14
00:04:32,597 --> 00:04:37,227
<i>not as to stone nor steel,
but they're tangible.</i>

15
00:04:37,403 --> 00:04:39,771
And we assume time
has an arrow,

16
00:04:39,806 --> 00:04:42,102
because it is as a clock.

17
00:04:42,406 --> 00:04:44,965
One second is
one second for everyone.

18
00:04:45,108 --> 00:04:47,974
<i>Cause precedes effect.</i>

19
00:04:48,143 --> 00:04:51,736
<i>Fruit rots,
water flows downstream.</i>

20
00:04:51,878 --> 00:04:54,575
<i>We're born, we age, we die.</i>

21
00:04:54,749 --> 00:04:56,841
<i>The reverse never happens.</i>

22
00:04:56,984 --> 00:05:01,079
None of this is true.
Say good-bye to classical reality,

23
00:05:01,187 --> 00:05:05,088
because our logic collapses
on the subatomic level...

24
00:05:05,256 --> 00:05:08,624
into ghosts and shadows.

25
00:07:57,757 --> 00:08:00,190
From Job's friends insisting...

26
00:08:00,326 --> 00:08:03,488
that the good are rewarded
and the wicked punished...

27
00:08:03,595 --> 00:08:05,459
to the scientists of the 1930s...

28
00:08:05,629 --> 00:08:07,789
proving to their horror a theorem...

29
00:08:07,897 --> 00:08:10,230
that not everything can be proved,

30
00:08:10,367 --> 00:08:13,632
<i>we've sought to impose
order on the universe.</i>

31
00:08:13,737 --> 00:08:17,171
<i>But we have discovered
something very surprising.</i>

32
00:08:17,305 --> 00:08:20,796
While order does exist in the universe,

33
00:08:20,941 --> 00:08:24,340
it is not at all what we had in mind.

34
00:08:24,476 --> 00:08:26,707
<i>Professor Birack, in relativity...</i>

35
00:08:26,813 --> 00:08:29,645
<i>geometry breaks down on the cosmic
scale, and in quantum physics...</i>

36
00:08:29,815 --> 00:08:32,874
<i>logic breaks down
on the sub-microscopic scale.</i>

37
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:55,094
What's this?
I don't know.

38
00:08:55,267 --> 00:08:57,862
Birack did that whole series of
debates on the B.B.C. A few years ago.

39
00:08:58,004 --> 00:08:59,994
Oh, with the English priest.
Right.

40
00:09:00,105 --> 00:09:02,095
Maybe they're planning
another one.

41
00:09:38,968 --> 00:09:43,268
He died before his appointment
with the Cardinal,

42
00:09:43,372 --> 00:09:45,362
but he left a diary.

43
00:09:48,876 --> 00:09:51,207
You-You must help us.

44
00:09:55,213 --> 00:09:57,046
Please.

45
00:10:24,603 --> 00:10:26,433
The discovery of this supernova...

46
00:10:26,604 --> 00:10:29,439
has immense significance
to the scientific community.

47
00:10:29,609 --> 00:10:32,338
Particles collected date
from pre-Cambrian times...

48
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:35,103
before man walked on earth.

49
00:10:35,246 --> 00:10:37,304
<i>Light from the explosion
was hurled through space...</i>

50
00:10:37,413 --> 00:10:40,404
<i>at 186,000 miles per second,</i>

51
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:45,111
and is just now reaching us
across the vast expanse of the universe.

52
00:11:29,721 --> 00:11:32,484
He was the guardian priest.

53
00:11:32,823 --> 00:11:35,882
Apparently, he lived here
for over 30 years.

54
00:11:35,992 --> 00:11:39,084
Once a week,
he would venture out for food.

55
00:11:40,295 --> 00:11:42,626
And every day,

56
00:11:42,765 --> 00:11:44,994
he opened this door.

57
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,775
Built in the 1500s...

58
00:12:11,885 --> 00:12:13,980
by arrangement
with the Spanish government.

59
00:12:14,089 --> 00:12:18,252
Who knew about this? Only the
members of this forgotten sect.

60
00:12:18,359 --> 00:12:20,656
The Brotherhood of Sleep.

61
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,990
There was a vow of silence.

62
00:12:24,096 --> 00:12:28,499
Even their very existence
was kept from the Holy See.

63
00:12:28,634 --> 00:12:31,124
The Vatican didn't know?

64
00:12:31,269 --> 00:12:34,260
The guardian priest
would keep the secret,

65
00:12:34,371 --> 00:12:37,270
and before he died
would pass it on to another.

66
00:12:37,439 --> 00:12:40,669
The sect had enormous
power and authority.

67
00:12:40,774 --> 00:12:43,140
Their actions were never questioned.

68
00:13:40,288 --> 00:13:43,653
Latin.
Some of it is in Latin.

69
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:49,490
<i>Some in Coptic, Greek, numbers.</i>

70
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,526
<i>It's not easy to decipher.</i>

71
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:56,530
The original text has been
distorted over the years.

72
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,997
Distorted?
Rewritten.

73
00:13:59,101 --> 00:14:01,093
Writing upon writing,

74
00:14:01,204 --> 00:14:03,502
sometimes two or three times,

75
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,130
and improperly erased.

76
00:14:06,275 --> 00:14:08,868
You can still see
the old writing.

77
00:14:09,043 --> 00:14:11,875
It's underneath.

78
00:14:12,045 --> 00:14:13,807
What is it?

79
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:20,382
<i>A secret that can no longer be kept.</i>

80
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:26,915
Do you feel it?
Yes. Something.

81
00:14:27,023 --> 00:14:29,617
It was never here before.

82
00:14:29,793 --> 00:14:33,093
It started a month ago.
What started?

83
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:38,666
A change in the earth...
and the sky.

84
00:14:41,068 --> 00:14:42,932
His power.

85
00:14:43,103 --> 00:14:44,933
I don't get it.
What don't you get?

86
00:14:45,106 --> 00:14:46,868
The whole thing.
It doesn't make sense.

87
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,837
It violates common sense. That's the whole
point. That's what Einstein couldn't accept.

88
00:14:50,009 --> 00:14:54,637
I can't accept it either. Do you know
anything about spontaneous human combustion?

89
00:14:54,812 --> 00:14:57,406
Walter, come on. That's
Schrodinger's cat. I know, I know.

90
00:14:57,548 --> 00:15:00,814
So what's the point? The point is,
until the cat is observed by someone,

91
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:03,910
he's not in any definite state,
either alive or dead.

92
00:15:04,021 --> 00:15:06,920
He's in a wave superposition state,
both dead and alive at the same time.

93
00:15:07,088 --> 00:15:08,385
Huh?
Okay.

94
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:11,322
Only when we open the box
and observe the cat...

95
00:15:11,492 --> 00:15:14,550
does he materialize into reality,
either dead or alive.

96
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:17,789
But it doesn't make sense. That
is the entire, complete point.

97
00:15:17,897 --> 00:15:20,160
It doesn't make
any common sense.

98
00:15:20,265 --> 00:15:22,596
Our common sense breaks down
on a subatomic level.

99
00:15:22,733 --> 00:15:24,860
Why do I want a Ph. D in this?

100
00:15:24,969 --> 00:15:26,800
Particle beam weapons,
research grants.

101
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:29,699
A millionaire when I'm 40.
Now I remember.

102
00:15:34,477 --> 00:15:36,809
<i>You're really gonna like this.
Class canceled?</i>

103
00:15:36,946 --> 00:15:39,311
"Will the following students
please see Professor Birack. "

104
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:41,038
Shit, there I am.
Me too.

105
00:15:41,181 --> 00:15:44,308
All of us. And we heard Birack wants
us to cancel our plans for the weekend.

106
00:15:44,417 --> 00:15:47,682
What? That's not all. A couple of
biochemistry's finest are coming with us.

107
00:15:47,787 --> 00:15:49,948
And someone to translate Latin.
Coming with us where?

108
00:15:50,056 --> 00:15:53,650
I'm gonna have to pull some strings here. This is just
not gonna happen. I have serious plans for the weekend.

109
00:15:53,792 --> 00:15:57,090
4:00, Walter, Birack's office. Oh, I gotta
ditch Pagels again. He's not gonna like it.

110
00:15:57,228 --> 00:16:00,093
Sleep with him.
Get an "A."

111
00:16:00,262 --> 00:16:03,460
So what about your plans?
I was gonna study, actually.

112
00:16:03,566 --> 00:16:05,863
Me too.
I'm Brian Marsh, by the way,

113
00:16:06,001 --> 00:16:07,991
since we're spending
the weekend together.

114
00:16:08,102 --> 00:16:11,537
I know.
Catherine Danforth.

115
00:16:11,671 --> 00:16:13,501
I know.

116
00:16:15,173 --> 00:16:17,303
So where did you
transfer from?

117
00:16:17,411 --> 00:16:19,878
Kneale.
Theoretical physics.

118
00:16:20,013 --> 00:16:23,412
I came here to study with Birack.
You're applied physics, right?

119
00:16:23,548 --> 00:16:25,708
So why are you taking
Birack for theory?

120
00:16:25,816 --> 00:16:27,874
I wanna know
what the math means.

121
00:16:27,984 --> 00:16:30,816
Birack's ruthless.
He wants philosophers, not scientists.

122
00:16:30,986 --> 00:16:34,047
Well, I've read his books.
He's a brilliant man.

123
00:16:34,156 --> 00:16:39,023
Just when I think I've got it,
visualized it, it just all goes away.

124
00:16:39,193 --> 00:16:42,753
I start seeing
old-fashioned classical reality again.

125
00:16:42,895 --> 00:16:45,591
I want the clock put back.
I wanna put it all into a little box.

126
00:16:45,764 --> 00:16:49,633
But whenever I try,
it just, uh, slithers out.

127
00:16:50,736 --> 00:16:53,465
Some things aren't changed
by quantum physics though.

128
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:57,232
Such as?
Well, for instance,

129
00:16:57,407 --> 00:17:01,774
every theoretical physicist
I know wonders why it is...

130
00:17:01,912 --> 00:17:04,209
that no one who looks like you...

131
00:17:04,313 --> 00:17:08,907
ever seems to settle down
in our end of the building.

132
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:12,881
That's not true, and that's
an extremely sexist thing to say.

133
00:17:13,053 --> 00:17:15,520
Confirmed sexist,
and proud of it.

134
00:17:18,491 --> 00:17:22,017
Hey. I was just joking.

135
00:17:24,194 --> 00:17:26,661
What happened?

136
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:29,794
You talk numbers, you get romantic.

137
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:32,091
You talk people, you clam up.

138
00:17:35,337 --> 00:17:37,999
Just a little miscue, that's all.

139
00:17:38,173 --> 00:17:40,072
It's not your fault.

140
00:17:41,675 --> 00:17:44,370
I'm sorry.
I'll see you later.

141
00:17:44,577 --> 00:17:46,373
Hey, wait.

142
00:17:49,949 --> 00:17:52,712
This conversation isn't what I
had in mind. Can we start over?

143
00:17:56,186 --> 00:17:59,278
Okay.
Okay.

144
00:17:59,321 --> 00:18:01,356
I was hoping that you would need
some help with your theory,

145
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:03,348
and that maybe we could discuss it...

146
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:07,353
over... over dinner or something.

147
00:18:08,964 --> 00:18:11,397
Well, I suppose
something could be arranged.

148
00:18:12,298 --> 00:18:17,324
There are other things
that I need help with... over dinner.

149
00:18:18,504 --> 00:18:22,097
I have volunteered our services
to the Archdiocese.

150
00:18:22,273 --> 00:18:24,502
Now, each of you
is a competent physicist,

151
00:18:24,608 --> 00:18:27,235
even though you don't have
a degree to prove it.

152
00:18:27,409 --> 00:18:29,876
Participating in this examination...

153
00:18:30,011 --> 00:18:33,574
will greatly improve your
classroom averages, I might add.

154
00:18:34,917 --> 00:18:36,941
<i>Plan to take your meals there.</i>

155
00:18:37,051 --> 00:18:39,484
<i>We'll bring cots to sleep on.</i>

156
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:43,385
<i>There are other departments joining us.
Excuse me, sir.</i>

157
00:18:43,556 --> 00:18:46,581
Is there some reason why you're not
telling us what we're gonna be doing?

158
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:50,992
In time.

159
00:19:27,324 --> 00:19:29,917
<i>It's your disbelief that powers him.</i>

160
00:19:30,091 --> 00:19:35,393
Your stubborn faith in...
in common sense...

161
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:37,793
that allows his deception.

162
00:19:39,099 --> 00:19:44,125
He lives in
the smallest parts of it...

163
00:19:44,236 --> 00:19:46,135
in the atoms.

164
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:48,896
Smaller,

165
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:50,940
invisible.

166
00:19:54,278 --> 00:19:56,905
He lives in all of it...

167
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,547
in the sum of its parts.

168
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:06,315
We must translate
this book.

169
00:20:06,487 --> 00:20:09,785
You must prove it
scientifically.

170
00:20:09,923 --> 00:20:11,753
Convince the outside world.

171
00:20:11,924 --> 00:20:16,120
The outside world doesn't want
to hear this kind of bullshit.

172
00:20:16,226 --> 00:20:18,091
Just keep it locked away.

173
00:20:18,261 --> 00:20:21,096
You've already managed that
for 2,000 years.

174
00:20:24,168 --> 00:20:26,965
No prison can hold him now.

175
00:20:37,878 --> 00:20:40,209
Hi.
HI.

176
00:20:40,346 --> 00:20:45,338
It's getting cold out here. I thought
this was supposed to be California.

177
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:47,884
Did you have a class tonight, or...
Library.

178
00:20:48,019 --> 00:20:52,251
Oh. Actually, I was hoping you'd
have a cup of coffee with me again.

179
00:20:54,157 --> 00:20:56,784
This is startin'
to become a habit.

180
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:59,552
Okay.
Okay.

181
00:21:55,538 --> 00:21:57,767
Good morning.

182
00:21:57,873 --> 00:21:59,703
Thank you.

183
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:07,911
We didn't get much sleep.
Mmm.

184
00:22:08,015 --> 00:22:09,845
Who needs sleep?

185
00:22:11,384 --> 00:22:14,250
We do. Today's Friday.

186
00:22:14,419 --> 00:22:16,682
Can I tell you something?

187
00:22:16,788 --> 00:22:20,085
Oh, please, don't.
I want to.

188
00:22:20,222 --> 00:22:22,817
Tell me next time...

189
00:22:22,993 --> 00:22:24,983
if there is one.

190
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:28,654
Or the time after that, or...

191
00:22:28,797 --> 00:22:30,855
two years from now.

192
00:22:32,332 --> 00:22:34,323
Who was he?

193
00:22:34,434 --> 00:22:37,494
The one who gave you
such a high opinion of men?

194
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:43,631
I wouldn't like it if
either of us jumped to conclusions.

195
00:22:43,742 --> 00:22:48,040
How do you know I was going to say
what you think I was gonna say?

196
00:22:48,144 --> 00:22:50,873
Because if you don't,

197
00:22:51,046 --> 00:22:52,878
I don't wanna know.

198
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:26,180
Oh, please, don't tell me.

199
00:24:26,289 --> 00:24:29,279
This place gives me the creeps.
Well, it was abandoned.

200
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:31,221
Hmm. I never would've guessed.

201
00:24:31,392 --> 00:24:33,689
No, I hear it used to be
a beautiful church. When?

202
00:24:33,793 --> 00:24:37,022
In the 1950s. My husband's
parents used to come here.

203
00:24:37,128 --> 00:24:40,030
And then for some reason,
it was closed down.

204
00:24:40,199 --> 00:24:43,395
Well!
Yeah.

205
00:24:49,972 --> 00:24:51,996
Hi. I'm, uh, Leahy.
I'm looking for Birack.

206
00:24:52,107 --> 00:24:55,271
Hi. Brian Marsh.
He's over in... There he is.

207
00:24:55,378 --> 00:24:57,208
Ah. Thanks.

208
00:25:09,455 --> 00:25:11,012
Professor Birack.
Yes.

209
00:25:11,156 --> 00:25:13,646
Hi. I'm Paul Leahy.
Oh. Dr. Leahy.

210
00:25:13,791 --> 00:25:17,556
I'm glad you could come. Yes. Well, now, all
I really know about what's goin' on here...

211
00:25:17,727 --> 00:25:19,887
is what one of your students
told me on the telephone.

212
00:25:19,995 --> 00:25:23,591
We're just getting organized. If you have
some equipment, find a spot over there.

213
00:25:23,767 --> 00:25:26,462
All right.
We're making this the central lab.

214
00:25:26,635 --> 00:25:31,093
Sure. Well, what are we
actually doing here?

215
00:25:38,811 --> 00:25:43,304
Well, I gotta cover for Leahy over
the weekend. Extra credit seminar. Wow.

216
00:25:46,483 --> 00:25:48,541
Hi, Frank.
Don't leave.

217
00:25:48,651 --> 00:25:51,813
Excuse me.
I have to set up.

218
00:25:51,954 --> 00:25:54,389
Hi.
Hello.

219
00:25:54,524 --> 00:25:56,821
Frankie, who's that?

220
00:25:56,959 --> 00:26:00,120
Susan Cabot.
Radiologist. Married.

221
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:02,819
Ah. How married?
Very.

222
00:26:02,962 --> 00:26:04,793
Oh. Hi, Doc.
Hi. I'll be workin' upstairs.

223
00:26:04,964 --> 00:26:07,363
I want you to set up the
basic panel down here. Right.

224
00:26:07,498 --> 00:26:09,331
What are you supposed
to be testing?

225
00:26:09,502 --> 00:26:11,833
I don't know.
Compounds? Basic structures?

226
00:26:11,971 --> 00:26:15,598
When I know, you'll know.
Uh, Leahy.

227
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,800
Great.
Science marches on.

228
00:26:18,908 --> 00:26:20,738
Yeah.

229
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:24,511
Need any help?
No, I'm okay.

230
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:28,239
There better be a diploma in my
mailbox when I get home on Monday.

231
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:47,594
I really can't believe this is
happening. I had a date tonight...

232
00:26:47,764 --> 00:26:50,132
with this beautiful young
trial attorney from Century City.

233
00:26:50,167 --> 00:26:52,861
Where were you taking him?
Please, it isn't funny.

234
00:26:56,304 --> 00:27:00,103
<i>What are they doing?
They're watching us.</i>

235
00:27:00,273 --> 00:27:02,901
They started comin' around when
I got here at 9:00 this morning.

236
00:27:03,076 --> 00:27:05,703
I'm Calder. Microbiology.
Brian Marsh.

237
00:27:05,878 --> 00:27:08,437
Walter.
Lomax. Engineering.

238
00:27:08,579 --> 00:27:09,637
Nice meeting you.
Hi.

239
00:27:09,747 --> 00:27:12,182
Lomax.
How you doing?

240
00:27:12,317 --> 00:27:14,409
So anybody know what
this whole deal's about yet?

241
00:27:14,518 --> 00:27:16,712
Not a clue.
Nobody's got a clue.

242
00:27:19,121 --> 00:27:21,520
I'm getting my doctorate
in theology.

243
00:27:21,655 --> 00:27:24,248
Analysis of ancient scriptures.

244
00:27:24,424 --> 00:27:28,725
This shouldn't be too difficult,
except for the numbers.

245
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:21,660
It's so wonderful
what you're doing, Father,

246
00:28:21,803 --> 00:28:24,431
opening the church again.

247
00:28:43,187 --> 00:28:45,381
Are you all right?

248
00:28:45,488 --> 00:28:47,387
We're ready.

249
00:29:27,288 --> 00:29:29,482
<i>He's gaining strength.</i>

250
00:29:30,623 --> 00:29:34,854
I can feel it all around us now.

251
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,549
So what's going on?

252
00:30:21,595 --> 00:30:23,755
Something downstairs.

253
00:30:23,863 --> 00:30:26,524
Yeah? What?

254
00:30:26,698 --> 00:30:31,136
I hate to tell you guys,
but this is real bullshit.

255
00:30:46,515 --> 00:30:49,574
I know there's a reason why
nobody's opened this thing yet, right?

256
00:30:51,085 --> 00:30:53,382
Let me have your pen
for a second.

257
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,817
Is this some kind of
toxic crap? Could be.

258
00:30:56,955 --> 00:31:00,653
Okay, but I still don't understand
why we're not taking direct samples.

259
00:31:00,826 --> 00:31:03,453
I mean, what's the big mystery?

260
00:31:13,604 --> 00:31:17,163
<i>Catherine's entering these equations
upstairs. They're translated from Latin.</i>

261
00:31:17,306 --> 00:31:19,137
Differential equations?

262
00:31:19,307 --> 00:31:21,138
From a book written
2,000 years ago.

263
00:31:21,309 --> 00:31:24,209
We hadn't invented
differential equations... Right.

264
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:16,142
<i>Professor Birack, I don't think
we have too much to worry about.</i>

265
00:32:16,285 --> 00:32:19,014
The lid on that thing won't open.
Look.

266
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:21,017
It's incredibly elaborate.

267
00:32:21,188 --> 00:32:24,384
Right here, there's a...
there's a weird locking mechanism.

268
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:27,254
Looks like it can only
be opened from the inside.

269
00:33:26,972 --> 00:33:29,235
I'm going back.

270
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,468
Look at this.

271
00:33:33,944 --> 00:33:37,379
Now, a friend of mine at U.C.L.A.
Did a study of chronic schizophrenics.

272
00:33:37,514 --> 00:33:41,710
<i>They're supposed to have stereotyped routines
that they repeat every 20 minutes or so.</i>

273
00:33:41,816 --> 00:33:45,845
You know, like a stuck record in their brains
repeating the same phrase over and over.

274
00:33:45,955 --> 00:33:48,717
Well, I have been watching them
on and off all day,

275
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:50,790
and they don't seem
to be making any movements.

276
00:33:50,958 --> 00:33:53,448
They just stand there.
With those kinds of problems,

277
00:33:53,593 --> 00:33:56,651
I say let 'em stand there
if they want to. Ooh!

278
00:33:56,761 --> 00:33:59,320
You okay?

279
00:33:59,463 --> 00:34:01,489
Yeah. I bumped into something
this afternoon.

280
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:03,726
It's starting to hurt.
Probably nerves.

281
00:34:03,835 --> 00:34:06,268
It's a bruise, Walter.
You don't bruise from nerves.

282
00:34:06,403 --> 00:34:10,838
I used to break out when I was 12.
Doctor said it was homosexual panic.

283
00:34:18,747 --> 00:34:20,611
I'll see you Monday morning.
You got anything for me?

284
00:34:20,781 --> 00:34:24,476
No, I'm afraid not. I'm guessing on the
acidity based upon the corrosion samples.

285
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:26,174
The figures you gave me.
Yeah.

286
00:34:26,352 --> 00:34:28,478
Well, it can't be that high. Well,
I know, but you asked me to guess.

287
00:34:28,586 --> 00:34:30,416
All right, get outta here.
Good night, sir.

288
00:34:30,589 --> 00:34:34,353
Hey, what's with the "sir" business?
Okay, good night, Sir Doc.

289
00:34:34,524 --> 00:34:36,855
Better.
A lot better.

290
00:34:59,876 --> 00:35:02,607
My God.

291
00:36:15,436 --> 00:36:17,428
Hey, look, can I talk
to you for a minute? Yes.

292
00:36:17,505 --> 00:36:19,335
Nobody's really saying
much of anything here.

293
00:36:19,506 --> 00:36:22,497
We're still putting together the first round of
tests, and nobody's really stopped since we got here.

294
00:36:22,608 --> 00:36:24,939
Get to the point.

295
00:36:25,076 --> 00:36:29,273
Nothing... anywhere ever is supposed
to be able to do what it is doing.

296
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:31,210
Now, settle down now.

297
00:36:31,381 --> 00:36:35,785
Go back to work. A life form is
growing out of pre-biotic fluid.

298
00:36:35,919 --> 00:36:39,183
It's not winding down into disorder.
It's self-organizing.

299
00:36:39,288 --> 00:36:42,779
It's becoming something.
What?

300
00:36:42,924 --> 00:36:45,255
I mean, an animal?
A disease? What?

301
00:36:47,395 --> 00:36:52,456
The hardest thing to hear for any of
us is something we don't agree with.

302
00:36:55,901 --> 00:36:59,528
"I saw a star fall from heaven
unto the bottomless pit,

303
00:36:59,703 --> 00:37:03,003
and he was cast out
as water from the flood... "

304
00:37:09,911 --> 00:37:12,003
This is crazy.

305
00:37:36,366 --> 00:37:38,560
Man.
Hadn't you seen it yet?

306
00:37:38,667 --> 00:37:43,295
No. For the last four hours, I've been
carbon dating the corrosion on the lid there.

307
00:37:43,504 --> 00:37:46,097
We're talking about
seven million years.

308
00:37:46,272 --> 00:37:49,572
What?
Yeah.

309
00:37:49,676 --> 00:37:53,304
I'm goin' topside.

310
00:37:53,513 --> 00:37:56,777
Want me to wait for you?
No, uh-uh. Go on.

311
00:38:44,752 --> 00:38:47,981
This whole section's a kind of history.
Part of it was indecipherable,

312
00:38:48,086 --> 00:38:50,988
as if someone were deliberately
trying to erase it.

313
00:38:51,157 --> 00:38:54,683
I managed to piece together most of it.
Okay, it kind of starts here.

314
00:38:54,826 --> 00:38:59,090
"The container was buried somewhere
in the Middle East eons ago by... "

315
00:38:59,195 --> 00:39:02,527
It gets a little wild here...
"the father of Satan,

316
00:39:02,665 --> 00:39:04,793
"a god who once walked the earth
before man...

317
00:39:04,901 --> 00:39:07,562
but was somehow banished
to the dark side. "

318
00:39:07,603 --> 00:39:11,094
Apparently, the father
buried his son inside the container.

319
00:39:11,372 --> 00:39:13,999
This was the section
someone was trying to erase.

320
00:39:14,174 --> 00:39:16,801
Now later on here,
"Christ comes to warn us.

321
00:39:16,976 --> 00:39:21,640
He was of extraterrestrial ancestry,
but a human-like race. "

322
00:40:23,395 --> 00:40:25,726
Finally, they determine Christ is crazy,

323
00:40:25,863 --> 00:40:30,561
but he's also gaining power converting a lot
of people to his beliefs, so they kill him.

324
00:40:30,734 --> 00:40:33,896
But his disciples keep the secret
and hide it from civilization...

325
00:40:34,002 --> 00:40:38,565
until man could develop a science sophisticated
enough to prove what Christ was saying.

326
00:40:38,707 --> 00:40:41,436
Something like this can really
fuck up your weekend.

327
00:40:41,642 --> 00:40:46,203
How did the Roman Catholic Church manage
to keep this a secret for 2,000 years?

328
00:40:46,345 --> 00:40:48,574
Apparently, a decision was made...

329
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:52,207
to characterize pure evil
as a spiritual force,

330
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:57,480
even within the darkness
in the hearts of men.

331
00:40:57,588 --> 00:40:59,714
It was more convenient.

332
00:40:59,822 --> 00:41:03,257
In that way, man remained
at the center of things.

333
00:41:03,392 --> 00:41:06,294
A stupid lie.
We were salesmen, that's all.

334
00:41:06,462 --> 00:41:09,861
We sold our product...

335
00:41:09,997 --> 00:41:12,726
to those who didn't have it.

336
00:41:12,899 --> 00:41:15,890
The new life.

337
00:41:16,001 --> 00:41:19,094
Reward ourselves,
punish our enemies...

338
00:41:19,203 --> 00:41:21,570
so we can live without truth.

339
00:41:23,442 --> 00:41:25,739
A substance,

340
00:41:25,843 --> 00:41:27,833
malevolence.

341
00:41:27,944 --> 00:41:30,070
That was the truth.

342
00:41:30,179 --> 00:41:32,408
Asleep...

343
00:41:32,514 --> 00:41:34,539
until now.

344
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:46,323
Help me break this up.
The others shouldn't hear this.

345
00:41:48,259 --> 00:41:51,856
Faith is a hard thing to come
by these days. Look at this.

346
00:41:54,366 --> 00:41:57,663
<i>That thing down therejust directed
a fairly sizable burst of energy.</i>

347
00:41:57,767 --> 00:41:59,860
Directed?

348
00:41:59,969 --> 00:42:03,801
In a straight line... with the precision
of less than a millisecond.

349
00:42:05,806 --> 00:42:10,044
Everybody's acting like we should
really be taking this seriously.

350
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:12,840
You two aren't taking
this seriously, are you?

351
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:31,857
What are we supposed to do?
Just go back to work?

352
00:42:32,027 --> 00:42:34,324
What would you rather have,
a wreath of garlic?

353
00:42:34,428 --> 00:42:38,092
A benediction?
A crucifix?

354
00:42:41,301 --> 00:42:45,567
Then it really is Old Scratch
knocking at the door.

355
00:42:45,672 --> 00:42:50,334
<i>A few minutes ago, a vibration was triggered
in the metal on that thing downstairs.</i>

356
00:42:50,508 --> 00:42:52,374
A strong one.
Some kind of...

357
00:42:52,544 --> 00:42:55,307
kinetic emission came out of it.

358
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,379
Now, if it can transmit
a signal strong enough...

359
00:42:57,547 --> 00:42:59,946
It can move other objects...

360
00:43:00,082 --> 00:43:03,278
instantaneously across a distance...

361
00:43:03,384 --> 00:43:05,214
Without outside intervention.

362
00:43:05,385 --> 00:43:07,215
Psychokinesis.

363
00:43:08,456 --> 00:43:11,322
Mind-directed energy.

364
00:43:11,492 --> 00:43:15,086
Don't tell the others yet.
Why not?

365
00:43:15,228 --> 00:43:19,492
They have a right to know that this...
that it... it's conscious.

366
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:21,894
Not until you prove
it wasn't something else...

367
00:43:21,998 --> 00:43:24,365
a power surge or a draft of air.

368
00:43:27,504 --> 00:43:29,937
All right.

369
00:43:49,787 --> 00:43:51,617
You missed the big history lesson.

370
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,789
You're not gonna believe
what's been going on up here.

371
00:44:20,977 --> 00:44:22,876
Want one?

372
00:44:24,714 --> 00:44:27,375
Anyone ever tell you that
you could pass for Asian?

373
00:44:29,751 --> 00:44:31,652
Whew.

374
00:44:34,455 --> 00:44:37,014
What was that all about?
No sense of humor.

375
00:44:37,156 --> 00:44:38,853
Have you seen Susan?
Who?

376
00:44:39,027 --> 00:44:42,256
Radiologist, glasses.
Oh, yeah. She's right outside.

377
00:44:47,898 --> 00:44:49,729
Where?

378
00:44:58,474 --> 00:45:01,636
She was there. I think
somebody oughta tell her.

379
00:45:01,743 --> 00:45:05,302
Look, am I crazy, or are we
stroking ourselves heavily here?

380
00:45:07,913 --> 00:45:10,212
Thank you for taking the time
to share your thoughts.

381
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:33,630
Susan?

382
00:45:43,542 --> 00:45:45,339
There's more to it.

383
00:45:57,821 --> 00:46:01,949
There's some kind of power...
directed outward.

384
00:46:02,056 --> 00:46:03,886
A controlled force.

385
00:46:04,057 --> 00:46:08,117
<i>What's it doing?
Reaching out.</i>

386
00:46:08,227 --> 00:46:10,526
Influencing.

387
00:46:11,664 --> 00:46:13,494
Changing things.

388
00:46:16,133 --> 00:46:18,692
Moving objects by thought.

389
00:46:22,038 --> 00:46:23,868
<i>Extraordinary intervention.</i>

390
00:46:24,039 --> 00:46:26,873
Intelligent cause other than man.

391
00:46:34,214 --> 00:46:36,045
Susan?

392
00:46:37,416 --> 00:46:39,679
<i>Hello?</i>

393
00:47:37,896 --> 00:47:39,727
Suppose...

394
00:47:39,898 --> 00:47:44,892
what your faith has said
was essentially correct.

395
00:47:45,003 --> 00:47:49,268
Suppose there is a universal mind
controlling everything.

396
00:47:49,373 --> 00:47:54,035
A god willing the behavior
of every subatomic particle.

397
00:47:55,409 --> 00:48:00,005
Now, every particle
has an anti-particle.

398
00:48:00,147 --> 00:48:02,979
Its mirror image.

399
00:48:03,149 --> 00:48:05,446
Its negative side.

400
00:48:05,584 --> 00:48:09,384
Maybe this universal mind...

401
00:48:09,555 --> 00:48:13,855
resides in the mirror image
instead of in our universe...

402
00:48:13,993 --> 00:48:16,586
as we wanted to believe.

403
00:48:18,528 --> 00:48:21,087
Maybe he's anti-God,

404
00:48:21,230 --> 00:48:23,493
bringing darkness instead of light.

405
00:48:23,598 --> 00:48:26,625
Why weren't we told the truth?

406
00:48:26,736 --> 00:48:30,932
<i>Without the technology to confirm,</i>

407
00:48:31,038 --> 00:48:32,868
<i>it would have been another legend.</i>

408
00:48:33,039 --> 00:48:35,530
But he was our prisoner, not yours!

409
00:48:37,377 --> 00:48:39,810
<i>We had a responsibility...</i>

410
00:48:39,945 --> 00:48:42,210
<i>to warn the rest of the world.</i>

411
00:48:43,415 --> 00:48:46,611
Only the corrupt
are listened to now,

412
00:48:46,717 --> 00:48:50,879
and they tell us
what we want to hear.

413
00:48:52,021 --> 00:48:55,319
We believe it to be divine light.

414
00:48:58,292 --> 00:49:00,192
It just got colder in here.

415
00:49:00,362 --> 00:49:02,795
I know.

416
00:49:02,930 --> 00:49:05,090
Suddenly, as if...

417
00:49:05,198 --> 00:49:07,961
as if something...

418
00:49:08,134 --> 00:49:10,693
moved through the room.

419
00:49:19,809 --> 00:49:21,639
Listen, do you realize
what's going on up there?

420
00:49:21,810 --> 00:49:24,039
We are on the brink
of the ultimate truth!

421
00:49:24,145 --> 00:49:26,271
Oh, this priest is a real case.

422
00:49:26,379 --> 00:49:30,477
He is looney tunes, and I'm
beginning to wonder about Birack too.

423
00:49:30,585 --> 00:49:33,144
I'm going back.
Come on, Calder.

424
00:49:33,287 --> 00:49:36,118
Come on, Frank!

425
00:49:36,288 --> 00:49:41,588
You're outta your minds!
This is a joke. This is caca.

426
00:49:45,463 --> 00:49:47,657
Come on!

427
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:55,060
Caca.

428
00:51:42,153 --> 00:51:44,281
Hello?

429
00:51:58,697 --> 00:52:02,361
Where's Wyndham?
Uh, he left.

430
00:52:04,069 --> 00:52:06,161
When?

431
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:08,603
<i>Oh, about 20 minutes ago.</i>

432
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:10,866
We tried to talk him out of it,
but, uh...

433
00:52:10,974 --> 00:52:13,703
Has anyone seen Susan?
Who?

434
00:52:13,876 --> 00:52:17,244
The radiologist. Glasses?

435
00:52:18,881 --> 00:52:20,711
<i>Well, maybe she left too.</i>

436
00:52:21,950 --> 00:52:24,315
Maybe they both had
the right idea.
