1
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:22,429
To the Bank of England! Quickly!

2
00:01:22,495 --> 00:01:23,869
Surround the building!

3
00:01:23,935 --> 00:01:26,488
You go that way! You go this way!

4
00:01:33,887 --> 00:01:36,254
There he is!

5
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,207
- Come on!
- After him, men!

6
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:05,461
That way!

7
00:02:28,127 --> 00:02:31,542
- He came this way. I'm sure of it.
- Come on!

8
00:02:31,615 --> 00:02:33,884
Come on, mates! Keep up!

9
00:02:38,463 --> 00:02:40,318
Sorry, sir.

10
00:03:00,831 --> 00:03:04,922
Today is the day I will finally achieve
what has been deemed impossible.

11
00:03:05,471 --> 00:03:08,787
Man can break
the 50-mile-per-hour speed barrier.

12
00:03:09,407 --> 00:03:12,156
And you're lucky
to be a part of it, Pierre.

13
00:03:12,224 --> 00:03:14,558
- It's Jean Michel, sir.
- Yes.

14
00:03:14,623 --> 00:03:18,136
We will make history.
Or we will die trying.

15
00:03:19,167 --> 00:03:21,404
- Die?
- This is very exciting.

16
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:24,668
That's it!
I refuse to be catapulted,

17
00:03:24,735 --> 00:03:28,794
electrocuted, or have my internal organs
disrupted any longer!

18
00:03:30,368 --> 00:03:32,342
I quit!

19
00:03:35,103 --> 00:03:37,013
He is a very sick man!

20
00:03:39,423 --> 00:03:42,325
The electrocution was not my fault!

21
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:45,497
You refused to wear
the rubber underpants!

22
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,509
We're looking for a bank robber.

23
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,508
Is there no man brave enough
to be my valet?

24
00:03:52,575 --> 00:03:54,714
Oh... Aah!

25
00:03:58,431 --> 00:03:59,773
I'm your new valet.

26
00:04:00,415 --> 00:04:03,547
Uh... I must commend
the valet service

27
00:04:03,616 --> 00:04:05,820
on their impeccable foresight.

28
00:04:05,888 --> 00:04:08,986
But they know I only
accept French valets.

29
00:04:09,055 --> 00:04:11,957
Yes. Oh! Oui! Oui!

30
00:04:12,063 --> 00:04:15,543
I come from a long line
of French valets.

31
00:04:15,647 --> 00:04:18,167
On my father's side.
Very, very French.

32
00:04:18,847 --> 00:04:22,557
- But your accent.
- My father French. Never speak.

33
00:04:22,623 --> 00:04:27,478
My mother Chinese and never shuts up.
All the children pick up her accent.

34
00:04:28,991 --> 00:04:30,682
Very well.

35
00:04:30,752 --> 00:04:34,680
Will you be willing to risk your life
to challenge the laws of physics?

36
00:04:34,751 --> 00:04:39,061
- Yes. Uh, and I can sing, too.
- Excellent. Pop this little hat on.

37
00:04:39,136 --> 00:04:42,070
- He's got to be in here.
- He's this way!

38
00:04:47,007 --> 00:04:50,204
And the throttle in your
right hand controls the speed.

39
00:04:55,039 --> 00:04:58,388
- How do I stop?
- Godspeed!

40
00:05:15,807 --> 00:05:16,822
Uh-uh-uh...

41
00:05:18,559 --> 00:05:22,104
Twenty-five miles per hour.
Yes, the pressure's stable-ish.

42
00:05:22,623 --> 00:05:26,136
We need more speed, man.

43
00:05:26,207 --> 00:05:28,542
Waah! Wee-yoo!

44
00:05:29,023 --> 00:05:31,805
Forty miles per hour.
Hang on in there, my good man.

45
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:39,256
Forty-seven.

46
00:05:39,327 --> 00:05:40,821
Forty-eight.

47
00:05:40,895 --> 00:05:42,618
Forty-nine.

48
00:05:42,687 --> 00:05:44,575
Eureka! We've done it!

49
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:54,109
Uh...

50
00:05:55,103 --> 00:05:56,085
Waaah!

51
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:58,548
I say, I say. Uh, good morning.

52
00:05:58,623 --> 00:06:02,235
- I'm looking for a man with...
- Over here!

53
00:06:02,304 --> 00:06:04,027
There he is. There's my valet.

54
00:06:07,135 --> 00:06:09,372
Sorry! New valet.

55
00:06:19,232 --> 00:06:21,468
Whoa!

56
00:06:21,535 --> 00:06:24,285
Whoa!

57
00:06:26,111 --> 00:06:28,412
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

58
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,221
You'll be able to let go any second.

59
00:06:32,287 --> 00:06:33,781
The pack will run out of steam

60
00:06:33,855 --> 00:06:38,110
in exactly three, two, one.

61
00:06:38,175 --> 00:06:39,866
Now.

62
00:06:39,935 --> 00:06:42,107
Look out!

63
00:06:44,575 --> 00:06:47,958
- That was incredible!
- We've broken the human speed barrier.

64
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:50,901
Good-bye, sir.

65
00:06:50,975 --> 00:06:53,822
It's been very nice valeting for you.

66
00:06:55,135 --> 00:06:58,430
Let's... do it again soon.

67
00:06:58,495 --> 00:06:59,804
Please, wait!

68
00:06:59,871 --> 00:07:02,806
With you as my brave valet,
I can test all my inventions.

69
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:04,887
No!

70
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,813
Spread out!

71
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:08,155
- Cover that...
- Yes, yes.

72
00:07:08,223 --> 00:07:10,940
- I take the job.
- Splendid!

73
00:07:11,007 --> 00:07:13,244
I can't wait to present
my results to the Academy.

74
00:07:15,295 --> 00:07:18,394
Too kind. Too kind. Thank you.

75
00:07:18,463 --> 00:07:22,969
And with this grant to develop
new applications for copper wire,

76
00:07:23,071 --> 00:07:26,235
Dr. Ramsey invented this.

77
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:32,536
Needless to say,
the Royal Academy of Science

78
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:36,349
declared this crackpot
mentally incompetent,

79
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:40,440
and he was duly dispatched
to a lunatic asylum.

80
00:07:42,559 --> 00:07:45,276
Sir. I have an urgent
announcement for you. Here.

81
00:07:45,343 --> 00:07:47,896
Don't just stand there. Read it.

82
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,909
Oh. Um...

83
00:07:49,983 --> 00:07:53,463
"It is with great distress

84
00:07:53,535 --> 00:07:56,121
that Scotland Yard announces

85
00:07:56,223 --> 00:07:58,841
that the Bank of England...
has been robbed."

86
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:03,894
My stolen Jade Buddha stolen?
You blighter!

87
00:08:03,967 --> 00:08:07,448
You gave me every assurance that
the Bank of England was impenetrable!

88
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:10,006
Sir, sir, I said, "lmpregnable."

89
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:12,763
It's the same thing, you idiot!

90
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:16,820
Please, please, not the quills!

91
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:18,750
Lord Salisbury!

92
00:08:18,815 --> 00:08:22,645
Please contact General Fang
and inform her, no Buddha, no deal.

93
00:08:22,719 --> 00:08:26,428
To forgo your obligation would
be dishonorable, Lord Kelvin.

94
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:29,910
A woman in the Royal Academy?

95
00:08:30,015 --> 00:08:33,560
The Jade Buddha was delivered
by us to the Bank of England.

96
00:08:33,663 --> 00:08:37,689
- What happens while in British hands...
- Is absolutely your concern.

97
00:08:37,727 --> 00:08:41,076
Colonel Kitchner,
chief of Scotland Yard,

98
00:08:41,151 --> 00:08:42,460
please inform General Fang

99
00:08:42,527 --> 00:08:45,014
what other items were stolen
from the bank.

100
00:08:45,087 --> 00:08:48,404
Nothing else.

101
00:08:48,479 --> 00:08:51,775
Exactly. It seems
your little land dispute

102
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,839
has spilled over
onto our noble shore.

103
00:08:54,911 --> 00:08:57,300
Until the Jade Buddha
is back in my possession,

104
00:08:57,407 --> 00:09:02,492
you and your cause will receive no
British military assistance whatsoever.

105
00:09:03,135 --> 00:09:04,794
Kitchner.

106
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:11,256
My agents will retrieve the Jade
Buddha once again, Lord Kelvin.

107
00:09:11,327 --> 00:09:14,588
This time, do not let it
slip through your fingers.

108
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:33,372
A female general.

109
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:36,570
What sort of pathetic man
takes orders from a woman?

110
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:42,140
Cor!

111
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:45,851
- Come away from here.
- Oh, Dad. Can't we stay?

112
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:55,900
My wind-powered pulley system

113
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:58,389
circulates the house with fresh air.

114
00:09:58,463 --> 00:10:01,333
Kitchen items are to be placed
on the white boat,

115
00:10:01,407 --> 00:10:03,774
and the blue is for laundry.

116
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,108
But most importantly,
this supplies the house

117
00:10:06,175 --> 00:10:09,306
with a running current of electricity.

118
00:10:10,591 --> 00:10:12,282
Electricity.

119
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:16,988
This is my comprehensive
data schedule and list of regulations.

120
00:10:17,055 --> 00:10:20,765
It's quite simple. You're never
to divert one iota from my plans.

121
00:10:20,831 --> 00:10:23,253
I must live my life
with total efficiency...

122
00:10:23,326 --> 00:10:25,693
to maximize my inventing capacity,

123
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:29,436
thus enabling me to do
the most I can for mankind.

124
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:33,780
Uh, Mr. Fogg, you are a noble,
precise gentleman.

125
00:10:34,335 --> 00:10:39,005
Thank you. Uh... Sorry.
What was your name? Ahem.

126
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:43,039
Passport. Too.

127
00:10:44,031 --> 00:10:45,525
Passepartout.

128
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,152
Bottled light.

129
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:57,717
A miracle.

130
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,197
Hardly.

131
00:10:59,263 --> 00:11:03,540
Just undiscovered science from
an American named Thomas Edison.

132
00:11:03,615 --> 00:11:06,364
It turns on with a whistle.

133
00:11:08,383 --> 00:11:11,449
Please don't do that.

134
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,461
Ah, I see your eye is drawn

135
00:11:13,567 --> 00:11:17,014
to what I hope will one day
be my crowning achievement.

136
00:11:17,086 --> 00:11:18,842
A giant moth?

137
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:23,414
- It's a flying machine.
- It can fly?

138
00:11:23,487 --> 00:11:25,527
Yes.

139
00:11:25,599 --> 00:11:28,282
No. But it will... one day.

140
00:11:28,351 --> 00:11:31,286
One day it will transport people
through the air.

141
00:11:31,359 --> 00:11:34,174
Perhaps over entire oceans.

142
00:11:36,479 --> 00:11:37,723
Uh-oh.

143
00:11:37,823 --> 00:11:40,725
I'm going to have
to make a rule for this.

144
00:11:52,831 --> 00:11:54,522
Dear Father:

145
00:11:54,591 --> 00:11:59,162
I will find the fastest way
back to China...

146
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:01,565
to make our village safe once again.

147
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:17,981
Passepartout?

148
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:22,716
Departure for the Royal Academy
of Science in two minutes.

149
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:24,092
Prepare my urban transport device.

150
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:26,014
Prepare my urban transport device.

151
00:12:27,103 --> 00:12:28,696
It's the shoes
with little wheels on them.

152
00:12:28,767 --> 00:12:29,530
It's the shoes
with little wheels on them.

153
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,264
Clear the way. Clear the way.

154
00:12:34,335 --> 00:12:36,637
Mr. Fogg coming through.
Watch out! Watch out!

155
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,701
Excuse me. Out of way.

156
00:12:41,214 --> 00:12:42,905
- Gangway.
- Fogg's arrived.

157
00:12:43,007 --> 00:12:45,276
- Gangway. Ooh!
- Hey!

158
00:12:45,343 --> 00:12:48,060
That makes it exactly
ten minutes before noon.

159
00:12:48,575 --> 00:12:50,037
That will be all.

160
00:12:54,335 --> 00:12:56,124
Gentlemen.

161
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:58,525
Today I have proved that man

162
00:12:58,591 --> 00:13:01,439
can break the 50-mile-per-hour
speed barrier

163
00:13:01,503 --> 00:13:03,870
without disrupting
his internal organs.

164
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:08,341
Where is your Royal Academy
of Science authorization?

165
00:13:08,415 --> 00:13:10,716
What am I thinking? What a fool.

166
00:13:10,782 --> 00:13:13,782
That would mean that you
were a real scientist!

167
00:13:15,551 --> 00:13:18,169
By your definition,
a real scientist's objective

168
00:13:18,239 --> 00:13:20,410
would be to prevent man from progress.

169
00:13:21,247 --> 00:13:23,319
We live in a golden age, Fogg.

170
00:13:23,391 --> 00:13:26,326
Everything worth discovering
has been discovered.

171
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,438
Yet ridiculous dreamers
like you insist

172
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:31,707
on a past filled with dinosaurs...

173
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:33,237
and evolution.

174
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:35,415
And on a future filled

175
00:13:35,486 --> 00:13:37,341
with motorized vehicles,

176
00:13:37,406 --> 00:13:39,643
radio waves,

177
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:41,566
and flying machines!

178
00:13:41,631 --> 00:13:44,730
Confound it! The bloody
Bank of England is a madhouse!

179
00:13:46,591 --> 00:13:49,406
Rumor has it the bloke's a foreigner.
An Asian chap.

180
00:13:50,431 --> 00:13:52,765
Rumor has it the bloke's a foreigner.

181
00:13:56,063 --> 00:13:57,339
Nothing.

182
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:04,947
Yes, I heard it was a Chinese fellow,
and he acted alone.

183
00:14:11,167 --> 00:14:15,193
No. Actually,
they say he was Norwegian.

184
00:14:18,975 --> 00:14:22,074
In fact, though, it was a gang
of elderly Norwegians.

185
00:14:22,878 --> 00:14:25,267
I heard it from a very reliable source

186
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:28,189
that it was a gang
of redheaded elderly Norwegians

187
00:14:28,255 --> 00:14:29,596
with very tiny feet.

188
00:14:31,807 --> 00:14:34,295
It's about time
someone robbed that bank.

189
00:14:34,367 --> 00:14:36,505
Like this very institution,

190
00:14:36,574 --> 00:14:38,516
the Bank of England is outdated.

191
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:41,525
As usual, your contempt
for tradition is appalling.

192
00:14:42,686 --> 00:14:45,621
You rest on your traditions,
if you prefer,

193
00:14:45,695 --> 00:14:49,372
but, as with this bank robber,
progress waits for no one.

194
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:52,824
So now you're an expert
on the bank thief as well.

195
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:56,156
Give us the benefit
of your ineffable wisdom, Fogg.

196
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:02,395
Twenty-six minutes ago,
a ship left Dover for Paris.

197
00:15:02,463 --> 00:15:05,016
From there, the thief
takes the Orient Express,

198
00:15:05,087 --> 00:15:08,348
where he transfers to a steamer,
from Istanbul to India.

199
00:15:08,415 --> 00:15:10,836
In little over a month,
that man could be in China.

200
00:15:11,646 --> 00:15:16,119
If we're to believe Fogg's calculations,
he will have circled the globe

201
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:18,045
and returned to England in a fortnight.

202
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:27,451
Actually, by my calculations, it would
be closer to, uh, exactly 80 days.

203
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,338
Outstanding idea.

204
00:15:37,406 --> 00:15:39,294
Well, then, Fogg,

205
00:15:39,359 --> 00:15:42,108
let's see you circumnavigate the world

206
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:44,509
in 80 days.

207
00:15:45,342 --> 00:15:49,368
I... That would be
a fruitless use of my time.

208
00:15:49,438 --> 00:15:51,543
I'm on the verge of numerous...

209
00:15:51,614 --> 00:15:53,981
countless... scientific breakthroughs.

210
00:15:55,102 --> 00:15:58,136
You coward. Admit it.
It cannot be done.

211
00:15:58,878 --> 00:16:01,628
It can! I could do it.

212
00:16:01,695 --> 00:16:03,931
A wager.

213
00:16:03,999 --> 00:16:07,097
£10,000.

214
00:16:07,711 --> 00:16:10,907
Unlike you and your colleagues,
money does not inspire me.

215
00:16:11,327 --> 00:16:14,938
I believe every man has his price.

216
00:16:15,006 --> 00:16:18,935
Even you, o noble Phileas Fogg.

217
00:16:19,007 --> 00:16:23,447
There must be something I could offer
that would be worthy of your time.

218
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:29,943
There is. Your position as head
of the Royal Academy.

219
00:16:33,598 --> 00:16:36,119
I could lead Britain
and the rest of the world

220
00:16:36,191 --> 00:16:38,711
into a new age of progress
and discovery.

221
00:16:42,078 --> 00:16:43,736
- Fair enough.
- What?

222
00:16:45,599 --> 00:16:49,211
I, Lord Kelvin, hereby vow

223
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:53,686
to surrender my position as minister
of science to Phileas Fogg...

224
00:16:53,758 --> 00:16:55,766
- No!
- No! No!

225
00:16:55,838 --> 00:16:59,613
if he can circumnavigate
the globe...

226
00:16:59,678 --> 00:17:02,134
in no more than 80 days.

227
00:17:03,806 --> 00:17:05,813
But if he cannot,

228
00:17:05,886 --> 00:17:09,748
he must never set foot
in this academy again,

229
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:15,421
he must tear down that abhorrent eyesore
he calls a laboratory,

230
00:17:15,486 --> 00:17:17,941
and he must swear...

231
00:17:18,014 --> 00:17:20,949
never to invent again.

232
00:17:24,511 --> 00:17:26,747
Just as I always suspected, Fogg.

233
00:17:26,815 --> 00:17:30,131
You promise so much, yet you deliver...

234
00:17:30,238 --> 00:17:31,732
oh, nothing.

235
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:36,825
- I'll take your wager.
- What did you say?

236
00:17:38,655 --> 00:17:40,510
I'll take your wager!

237
00:17:41,502 --> 00:17:42,811
He did it.

238
00:17:46,302 --> 00:17:48,026
Then it's done.

239
00:17:48,095 --> 00:17:52,219
A man who has never set foot
out of England circling the globe.

240
00:17:53,855 --> 00:17:56,244
This is going to be rather amusing.

241
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:02,620
History won't remember your amusement,
but it will be hard-pressed to forget

242
00:18:02,718 --> 00:18:07,158
the moment I'm standing on the very top
step of the Royal Academy of Science.

243
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:10,165
By the strike of noon,

244
00:18:10,271 --> 00:18:13,882
after I, Phileas Fogg,
have traveled around the world

245
00:18:14,654 --> 00:18:16,694
in 80 days!

246
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,444
Oh, dear.

247
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:30,686
Mr. Fogg, we all pack and ready to go.
Mr. Fogg, are you in here?

248
00:18:30,751 --> 00:18:33,817
Phileas! Phileas! Phileas!

249
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:37,783
- Uh...
- Mr. Fogg, are you well, sir?

250
00:18:37,886 --> 00:18:39,610
Huh?

251
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:41,533
Uh, Passepartout.

252
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:45,438
Would you... sit with me a moment?

253
00:18:50,814 --> 00:18:51,861
Yes, sir.

254
00:18:57,023 --> 00:19:00,284
I risked everything,
my entire life's work.

255
00:19:01,534 --> 00:19:04,436
For something you believe in.

256
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:07,412
Nothing could make
more sense than that, sir.

257
00:19:12,606 --> 00:19:14,428
You are honorable, Passepartout.

258
00:19:15,646 --> 00:19:19,094
But I'm afraid this was
a calamitous lapse of judgment.

259
00:19:23,198 --> 00:19:24,823
- Mr. Fogg?
- Yes?

260
00:19:25,502 --> 00:19:28,252
- Let your family...
- There is no one left to tell.

261
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:32,730
This house and my inventions
are all I have.

262
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:41,975
And a brave French valet that will help
you make it around the world in 80 days.

263
00:19:46,527 --> 00:19:49,276
- You really believe we can succeed?
- Yes.

264
00:19:49,886 --> 00:19:52,569
Yes. Yes. Yes!

265
00:19:52,638 --> 00:19:55,508
You're mad. We'll be sliced to pieces
before we reach India.

266
00:19:58,334 --> 00:19:59,709
We're with you, sir!

267
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:04,696
Good luck!

268
00:20:09,342 --> 00:20:11,098
Halt!

269
00:20:13,758 --> 00:20:17,174
- Quite a contraption here, Mr. Fogg.
- Thank you, Inspector.

270
00:20:17,278 --> 00:20:22,842
But I'm afraid I'm gonna have to detain
you and your valet until further notice.

271
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:27,133
This here doohickey is in violation
of the city's new vehicle code.

272
00:20:27,806 --> 00:20:29,301
Vehicle code?

273
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:31,065
Code 431.

274
00:20:31,134 --> 00:20:35,063
All vehicles
must be powered by horses.

275
00:20:35,135 --> 00:20:38,811
Or other indigenous
quadruped creatures of the like,

276
00:20:38,879 --> 00:20:40,667
excluding giraffes and...

277
00:20:40,734 --> 00:20:42,261
You're driveling. Stand aside.

278
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:44,822
I'm about to embark upon
a journey around the world.

279
00:20:44,926 --> 00:20:47,315
Not in this monstrosity,
you're not. No!

280
00:20:47,423 --> 00:20:49,277
- Mm-mm.
- That's hot.

281
00:20:50,078 --> 00:20:51,867
It's... Ow!

282
00:21:02,846 --> 00:21:05,529
Time to go.
We have a boat to catch.

283
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:08,894
Stealing a police vehicle is not
an acceptable way to begin our journey.

284
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:11,063
- Not stealing. Borrowing.
- Excuse us.

285
00:21:11,134 --> 00:21:14,003
We're borrowing this vehicle
to catch our ship to Paris,

286
00:21:14,078 --> 00:21:16,729
if someone could inform
the appropriate authorities.

287
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:28,567
Bloody hell! Me brain's leakin'!

288
00:21:31,742 --> 00:21:33,269
Ahh! Damn that nincompoop Fix.

289
00:21:33,342 --> 00:21:35,764
What's the point of hiring
a corrupt police officer

290
00:21:35,838 --> 00:21:38,205
if he can't abuse the law properly?

291
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:39,644
- Kitchner.
- Sir!

292
00:21:39,711 --> 00:21:41,565
Tell Fix to pack his bags.

293
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:43,573
- He's going on a trip.
- Right away, sir.

294
00:22:31,807 --> 00:22:32,854
Hmm. Smart man.

295
00:22:32,926 --> 00:22:35,293
Passepartout, tell this
impudent fellow we must

296
00:22:35,358 --> 00:22:39,580
leave within six and a half hours, or we
miss our connection in Constantinople.

297
00:22:39,646 --> 00:22:42,428
Yes, sir. Please.
We are in a great hurry.

298
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:43,704
- Passepartout?
- Yes?

299
00:22:43,774 --> 00:22:45,749
In French.

300
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:53,019
Sacre bleu, la champignon,

301
00:22:53,086 --> 00:22:57,144
chateau, bien, françoise, voilà,
ooh-la-la, foie de gras.

302
00:23:03,326 --> 00:23:04,952
- What did he say?
- Uh...

303
00:23:05,918 --> 00:23:06,900
He say...

304
00:23:14,366 --> 00:23:16,504
- What?
- He says not to worry.

305
00:23:16,574 --> 00:23:20,503
The next train will leave in five hours.
Good time for sightseeing.

306
00:23:20,574 --> 00:23:24,021
Passepartout, this is
a scientific expedition, not a holiday!

307
00:23:24,126 --> 00:23:26,101
I will not miss this train.

308
00:23:27,774 --> 00:23:29,596
Ah!

309
00:23:29,663 --> 00:23:31,321
- Very amazing.
- What?

310
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:32,917
What does it say?

311
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:35,292
Eddie Thomason will be
showing his inventions.

312
00:23:35,358 --> 00:23:37,497
Thomas Edison? Here in Paris?

313
00:23:37,566 --> 00:23:40,435
What a chance for you
to meet another great inventor.

314
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:44,023
I would quite like to tell him
about my whistle modification.

315
00:23:44,094 --> 00:23:45,174
Good idea.

316
00:23:50,046 --> 00:23:52,413
See? Exposition. Science.

317
00:24:05,534 --> 00:24:08,284
I assure you these are not
the works of Thomas Edison.

318
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:10,772
Uh, I think he is
somewhere around here.

319
00:24:11,294 --> 00:24:15,004
Wait a moment. This isn't science.

320
00:24:15,774 --> 00:24:17,432
This is art.

321
00:24:17,502 --> 00:24:18,877
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

322
00:24:18,942 --> 00:24:21,047
That painting is highly inaccurate.

323
00:24:21,118 --> 00:24:23,769
It's not supposed
to be accurate.

324
00:24:24,862 --> 00:24:28,637
The artist views reality
through imagination

325
00:24:28,702 --> 00:24:31,801
rather than simply recording it.

326
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:34,455
It is called "lmpressionism."

327
00:24:35,774 --> 00:24:38,840
Well, um, I'm not impressed.

328
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:42,325
Trees are not violet,
grass is not charcoal,

329
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:44,187
and a man cannot...

330
00:24:54,462 --> 00:24:55,869
fly.

331
00:24:55,934 --> 00:24:57,843
You feel something.

332
00:24:58,366 --> 00:25:00,089
You dream of flying.

333
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:02,776
Or of naked men.

334
00:25:02,846 --> 00:25:05,213
- Sometimes.
- Ah.

335
00:25:05,278 --> 00:25:08,311
The flying. N-N-Not the men.

336
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:11,197
I am glad you like my painting.
Monique La Roche.

337
00:25:11,262 --> 00:25:15,321
Phileas Fogg. I must say, it's a lot
better than these amateurs.

338
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:17,365
What did he say?

339
00:25:19,902 --> 00:25:22,520
Oh, no.

340
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:35,194
Non.

341
00:25:50,526 --> 00:25:53,243
Goodness. What was that all about?

342
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:57,085
Well, a wealthy gentleman
bought my painting for a lot of money.

343
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,513
Champagne for everyone!

344
00:26:12,222 --> 00:26:16,116
I'm still looking for Mr. Eddie.
Nice painting.

345
00:26:18,718 --> 00:26:21,304
Have you considered
a career in schematic drawing?

346
00:26:21,982 --> 00:26:24,567
No. It would be far too limiting.

347
00:26:24,637 --> 00:26:26,841
At least your work
shows genuine promise.

348
00:26:28,222 --> 00:26:31,997
Thank you. Those I painted
many months ago.

349
00:26:32,062 --> 00:26:33,917
I was lacking inspiration.

350
00:26:34,014 --> 00:26:37,462
I found some men
to help me find Mr. "Edimon."

351
00:26:38,558 --> 00:26:41,373
- This way.
- Thank you. Thank you.

352
00:26:43,133 --> 00:26:44,410
He's very eager.

353
00:26:46,494 --> 00:26:47,836
Get him!

354
00:26:55,294 --> 00:26:59,124
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Oh, it's terrible, no?

355
00:26:59,197 --> 00:27:00,659
No, no, it's...

356
00:27:00,734 --> 00:27:01,944
- clever.
- Oh.

357
00:27:02,014 --> 00:27:03,159
Hmm. Yes.

358
00:27:03,645 --> 00:27:05,074
- He's a clown.
- Mm-hmm.

359
00:27:05,182 --> 00:27:07,124
And yet...

360
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:09,335
he's incredibly angry.

361
00:27:09,438 --> 00:27:12,733
The irony is, uh, terrifying.

362
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:14,718
- Is that good?
- Is it?

363
00:27:42,974 --> 00:27:44,315
Ah, this is interesting.

364
00:27:45,694 --> 00:27:48,727
Without opposable thumbs,
a dog could never play poker.

365
00:27:48,798 --> 00:27:50,937
Yes, they can.

366
00:27:51,006 --> 00:27:52,915
Where have you seen
a dog playing poker?

367
00:27:53,758 --> 00:27:55,449
Right there.

368
00:28:27,421 --> 00:28:29,593
Perhaps I'm not the best judge.

369
00:28:31,838 --> 00:28:34,838
Bandits! They come to take away
all the paintings!

370
00:28:44,445 --> 00:28:47,609
- Quickly! Come this way!
- Passepartout!

371
00:28:50,109 --> 00:28:51,287
Go, go, go!

372
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:16,253
Thank you, Miss La Roche.
You may just have saved our trip.

373
00:29:16,318 --> 00:29:18,707
- There you are.
- I would, uh...

374
00:29:18,813 --> 00:29:21,464
- I would like to repay you.
- Take me with you.

375
00:29:21,533 --> 00:29:25,112
- What?
- I'm stifled here. Pigeonholed.

376
00:29:25,182 --> 00:29:28,662
They think of me only
as a coat-check girl!

377
00:29:28,734 --> 00:29:32,083
- Why?
- Because I am the coat-check girl.

378
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:33,655
- Ah.
- Look.

379
00:29:33,726 --> 00:29:36,246
The leading art critic in Paris.

380
00:29:36,318 --> 00:29:38,707
Look what he wrote
about one of my paintings.

381
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:42,557
- I can't read this. It's French.
- I wish I couldn't.

382
00:29:42,622 --> 00:29:44,247
Why do you carry it?

383
00:29:44,317 --> 00:29:49,074
When I do succeed,
I can throw it in his face, but for now,

384
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:51,997
I need a world journey to inspire me.

385
00:29:55,806 --> 00:29:58,969
I'm inspired to get us
back on schedule.

386
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:04,278
Let's see. Wind velocity
approximately twelve knots,

387
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:07,000
factoring in air density...

388
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:08,280
Outstanding!

389
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:11,481
Passepartout, onward! Ah.

390
00:30:18,302 --> 00:30:21,236
There we go. Passepartout,
tell him to keep the change.

391
00:30:21,342 --> 00:30:23,644
Uh... 
fromage, por favor.

392
00:30:25,053 --> 00:30:27,159
We are going around
the world in 80 days!

393
00:30:32,733 --> 00:30:34,773
The balloon cannot
support all this weight!

394
00:30:34,878 --> 00:30:37,245
Your hot air should compensate, no?

395
00:30:37,277 --> 00:30:39,219
Get off!

396
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:49,275
- What are they doing?
- They're being disorderly.

397
00:30:49,342 --> 00:30:51,284
Hey! Let go! Let go!

398
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:55,994
Hey! Passepartout!
My valise! It has all my money in it.

399
00:31:07,262 --> 00:31:09,531
Hey, lady, lady, lady! It's my bag.

400
00:31:09,598 --> 00:31:11,453
No, that is my bag.

401
00:31:11,518 --> 00:31:14,006
No, that's not your bag. It's my bag!

402
00:31:14,078 --> 00:31:15,092
- No!
- You crazy.

403
00:31:15,165 --> 00:31:16,594
Yes.

404
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:20,379
That tickles!

405
00:31:27,037 --> 00:31:28,411
You took my bag.

406
00:31:28,478 --> 00:31:30,234
Mr. Fogg!

407
00:31:31,582 --> 00:31:32,760
- Good catch!
- Thank you.

408
00:31:45,181 --> 00:31:46,359
Ooh!

409
00:31:50,045 --> 00:31:52,053
Those are the gallery bandits.

410
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:02,325
Oh, yes!

411
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:04,317
Ah.

412
00:32:09,085 --> 00:32:12,381
He stole my purse!
This devil stole my purse!

413
00:32:34,974 --> 00:32:37,363
My bag! He took my... Ah!

414
00:32:38,589 --> 00:32:42,299
- We've stolen that old lady's purse.
- Huh. Here.

415
00:32:45,246 --> 00:32:49,305
We must help Passepartout.
How do I make this go lower?

416
00:32:49,374 --> 00:32:51,992
What are you doing?
Decrease the overall weight...

417
00:32:52,062 --> 00:32:54,200
- That's not going to work.
- Yes, it is.

418
00:32:58,174 --> 00:32:59,897
Physics, no?

419
00:32:59,998 --> 00:33:01,754
Yes.

420
00:33:15,485 --> 00:33:17,395
Ahhh...

421
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:19,674
Ooh! Ay! Owww.

422
00:33:29,277 --> 00:33:30,455
Bonjour.

423
00:33:30,558 --> 00:33:33,492
Bonjour.

424
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:36,339
- Eh?
- Bye-bye!

425
00:33:43,806 --> 00:33:45,944
Wake up, lady! Wake up, lady!

426
00:33:50,237 --> 00:33:52,571
Wake up! Lady, wake up!

427
00:34:01,309 --> 00:34:03,065
- Bye, mama.
- Merci.

428
00:34:03,165 --> 00:34:04,092
Bye, baby.

429
00:34:06,557 --> 00:34:08,467
Ohh...

430
00:34:14,814 --> 00:34:17,661
Very impressive. I'd have let go by now.

431
00:34:22,398 --> 00:34:24,787
The statue's grabbing his trousers.

432
00:34:24,893 --> 00:34:26,933
I don't think it's doing it on purpose.

433
00:34:39,709 --> 00:34:42,873
Oh, dear.

434
00:34:51,645 --> 00:34:54,362
Help!

435
00:35:01,981 --> 00:35:03,541
Well done, Passepartout.

436
00:35:03,613 --> 00:35:06,461
We're still on schedule
despite those dogged thieves.

437
00:35:06,525 --> 00:35:08,347
Yes, yes. Thank you.

438
00:35:12,126 --> 00:35:15,224
Those art thieves
seemed to recognize you.

439
00:35:16,062 --> 00:35:20,666
- I look like someone they know.
- Some other Frenchman, perhaps?

440
00:35:22,782 --> 00:35:28,117
- So, where can we drop you off?
- We're not stopping.

441
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:31,037
Once we land to board
the Orient Express, you are free to go.

442
00:35:31,101 --> 00:35:32,476
Thank you so much.

443
00:35:33,438 --> 00:35:35,859
- For what?
- I'm free to go with you.

444
00:35:35,933 --> 00:35:38,388
I did not say you were free to come.

445
00:35:38,494 --> 00:35:40,217
- I said you were free to go.
- Where?

446
00:35:41,149 --> 00:35:43,483
- Anywhere.
- Thank you. I will go with you.

447
00:35:45,374 --> 00:35:48,440
- No, you will not, Miss La Roche.
- Monique.

448
00:35:48,573 --> 00:35:49,653
Miss... Monique!

449
00:35:50,109 --> 00:35:51,538
There! Now we are getting along.

450
00:35:54,558 --> 00:35:56,565
Comme c'est beau.

451
00:35:56,638 --> 00:35:58,678
C'est magnifique.

452
00:36:00,349 --> 00:36:01,942
Toutes ces couleurs.

453
00:36:02,013 --> 00:36:05,625
Look at the sunrise.
There is only one word for it.

454
00:36:05,693 --> 00:36:08,181
- "Magical."
- Miss La Roche!

455
00:36:08,254 --> 00:36:11,123
I refuse to allow you
to continue traveling with us.

456
00:36:11,229 --> 00:36:15,059
I'm not traveling with you.
I'm making my own way.

457
00:36:15,165 --> 00:36:17,020
Maybe you shouldn't travel with me.

458
00:36:17,085 --> 00:36:19,606
This is what happens
when you leave your home.

459
00:36:19,709 --> 00:36:22,459
You meet... people!

460
00:36:30,461 --> 00:36:33,560
Why are you keeping up this ruse?

461
00:36:36,797 --> 00:36:41,980
Perhaps I should inform Mr. Fogg,
and together he and I can speculate.

462
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:54,936
A very sacred object
was stolen from my village.

463
00:36:55,005 --> 00:36:56,914
I have taken it back.

464
00:37:06,622 --> 00:37:07,866
Incroyable.

465
00:37:08,765 --> 00:37:12,475
For many centuries, the Jade Buddha
has protected my people.

466
00:37:12,541 --> 00:37:15,640
It has never left our village until now.

467
00:37:18,365 --> 00:37:21,300
And those art thieves. Who are they?

468
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:25,748
The Black Scorpions.
They work for an evil warlord. Fang.

469
00:37:25,822 --> 00:37:29,269
She wants the Buddha
so she can take over my village.

470
00:37:29,341 --> 00:37:33,236
I must return the Jade Buddha
to protect Lanzhou.

471
00:37:33,309 --> 00:37:35,992
Mr. Fogg is the fastest way.

472
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:40,759
Perhaps, then,
we can help one another.

473
00:37:41,469 --> 00:37:45,048
I will keep your secret,
and you convince Mr. Fogg

474
00:37:45,118 --> 00:37:47,539
to allow me to travel
the world with you.

475
00:37:54,366 --> 00:37:58,643
Keep this Dummkopf in his seat,
or we throw him off!

476
00:38:00,189 --> 00:38:04,182
Merely pointing out if they coordinated
their coal-shoveling technique,

477
00:38:04,253 --> 00:38:07,482
they could maximize our speed.

478
00:38:09,405 --> 00:38:13,846
When we reach Constantinople, I suggest
you board a train we are not on.

479
00:38:14,782 --> 00:38:19,353
- Uh, Mr. Fogg, she must come with us.
- And why is that?

480
00:38:19,453 --> 00:38:24,057
Uh, we just discovered that we are
related from the same family.

481
00:38:26,941 --> 00:38:32,059
I'm her father's second cousin's sister
on my mother's side. French.

482
00:38:33,757 --> 00:38:37,434
Monsieur Fogg. If I make the train
go faster, I can come with you, oui?

483
00:38:37,501 --> 00:38:40,087
Yes.

484
00:38:43,326 --> 00:38:45,944
I bid you farewell, Miss La Roche.

485
00:39:00,317 --> 00:39:04,310
If there's anything else you would like,
just let us know, Miss La Roche.

486
00:39:04,957 --> 00:39:06,647
Ah! Voilà.

487
00:39:06,717 --> 00:39:10,744
Champagne with your first-class seats,
Mademoiselle La Roche.

488
00:39:10,814 --> 00:39:11,893
Merci.

489
00:39:13,149 --> 00:39:15,123
- Champagne?
- No, thank you.

490
00:39:17,149 --> 00:39:18,807
- Merci.
- Monsieur.

491
00:39:25,629 --> 00:39:27,603
A tea?

492
00:39:49,181 --> 00:39:50,196
Okay.

493
00:39:52,669 --> 00:39:55,352
How to make English tea.

494
00:39:56,029 --> 00:39:58,648
Precisely 96 degrees.

495
00:40:04,125 --> 00:40:05,205
Ooh.

496
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:07,798
Excuse me, sir.

497
00:40:07,869 --> 00:40:10,716
- Fogg's valet!

498
00:40:10,813 --> 00:40:13,682
- A jade Buddha!
- This is not a jade Buddha.

499
00:40:13,725 --> 00:40:17,783
- Oh, yes, it is!
- You're right. But I'm not a valet.

500
00:40:17,853 --> 00:40:19,763
Oh. Really?

501
00:40:21,373 --> 00:40:22,518
Owww!

502
00:40:23,709 --> 00:40:25,651
Me bloody nose!

503
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:29,401
Let me in!
You're gonna pay for scorchin' me willy!

504
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:45,877
Heh-heh-heh-heh. Now I gotcha.

505
00:40:47,005 --> 00:40:50,005
Ow! Oh! Ow!

506
00:40:50,077 --> 00:40:53,077
Ahhh!

507
00:40:53,149 --> 00:40:55,058
You're under arrest!

508
00:40:56,925 --> 00:40:59,161
Ah! Ooh! Ow!

509
00:41:00,093 --> 00:41:01,435
Sorry!

510
00:41:17,693 --> 00:41:19,602
Why the devil are we stopping?

511
00:41:27,069 --> 00:41:29,306
Prince Hapi would be honored
to have Fogg

512
00:41:29,373 --> 00:41:31,577
and his traveling companions
at his banquet.

513
00:41:31,677 --> 00:41:33,270
How very flattering.

514
00:41:33,373 --> 00:41:37,268
But please inform Prince "Happy"
that we are on a very tight schedule.

515
00:41:38,173 --> 00:41:40,922
Prince Hapi demands it.

516
00:41:41,565 --> 00:41:44,729
Then Prince Hapi
will have to get accustomed

517
00:41:44,797 --> 00:41:46,936
to not getting everything he wants.

518
00:41:54,141 --> 00:41:56,148
It is magnificent.

519
00:41:56,221 --> 00:41:58,938
Mr. Fogg, his house
is even bigger than yours.

520
00:41:59,005 --> 00:42:02,650
His collection, his taste...
It is exquisite.

521
00:42:02,717 --> 00:42:04,146
Yes, it is.

522
00:42:05,373 --> 00:42:08,275
Not good.
Very old. Look. Broken.

523
00:42:08,349 --> 00:42:11,219
And where is His Highness?

524
00:42:19,421 --> 00:42:23,066
Oh. The prince is also
a talented musician.

525
00:42:23,133 --> 00:42:25,751
If I did nothing
but lounge about the palace,

526
00:42:25,821 --> 00:42:27,861
I'd learn to pluck a few notes.

527
00:42:40,253 --> 00:42:42,773
Let's make this brief.
I'll pose for photographs,

528
00:42:42,876 --> 00:42:44,764
wearing a turban,
holding an atlas...

529
00:42:44,861 --> 00:42:46,268
Mademoiselle.

530
00:42:48,477 --> 00:42:53,333
How magical that our paths should cross.
Do you believe in fate?

531
00:42:53,405 --> 00:42:54,932
Is that what you call it

532
00:42:55,004 --> 00:42:57,557
when one stops a train
and kidnaps its passengers?

533
00:42:57,629 --> 00:42:59,637
Phileas Fogg.

534
00:42:59,709 --> 00:43:01,170
Please forgive me,

535
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:05,653
but I feel like Aphrodite herself
descended to Earth.

536
00:43:06,461 --> 00:43:08,371
What is a ravishing
woman like you...

537
00:43:10,269 --> 00:43:15,025
- I never think when I'm naked.
- I do. In the bath.

538
00:43:15,101 --> 00:43:16,759
- Yes. Well, I mean...
- No!

539
00:43:16,861 --> 00:43:18,748
Don't touch it!

540
00:43:18,845 --> 00:43:24,028
- That is my most treasured possession.
- I was only pointing. I was just...

541
00:43:24,093 --> 00:43:25,882
Don't even point.

542
00:43:25,949 --> 00:43:27,509
Rodin.

543
00:43:27,581 --> 00:43:30,581
Yes. A Rodin.

544
00:43:30,653 --> 00:43:31,995
Oh.

545
00:43:32,061 --> 00:43:35,410
I have never seen a more beautiful...
muscular form.

546
00:43:35,485 --> 00:43:39,314
Well, I can assure you,
I'm in much better shape now.

547
00:43:39,389 --> 00:43:42,520
Incroyable. It is a sculpture of you!

548
00:43:42,589 --> 00:43:43,734
Yes.

549
00:43:43,805 --> 00:43:46,773
"Hapi Birthday.
Your pal, Rodin."

550
00:43:46,877 --> 00:43:50,074
- Come, my dear. Let us dine.
- Yes.

551
00:43:51,869 --> 00:43:54,716
Ah, Mr. Fogg, please join us.

552
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:56,690
No, sorry. We are on a tight schedule.

553
00:43:56,765 --> 00:43:59,580
We will join you, actually.
But just one drink.

554
00:44:05,277 --> 00:44:08,441
After the duke and the duchess
sat down in the bath,

555
00:44:08,509 --> 00:44:11,062
I realized I forgot
to put on my bathing suit.

556
00:44:16,829 --> 00:44:18,105
I'm such a fool.

557
00:44:18,205 --> 00:44:22,067
Always embarrassing myself
in front of visiting dignitaries.

558
00:44:22,173 --> 00:44:25,075
But you know how that can be,
right, Phil?

559
00:44:25,181 --> 00:44:27,068
Uh, yes.

560
00:44:27,133 --> 00:44:29,751
Uh, it's Phileas, actually.

561
00:44:29,821 --> 00:44:33,334
So, Foggy, tell me.
I heard you're an inventor.

562
00:44:33,405 --> 00:44:36,634
Well, I try to apply myself
to thinking of new ways

563
00:44:36,701 --> 00:44:39,189
to help better mankind,
if that's what you mean.

564
00:44:39,261 --> 00:44:41,116
Well, I'm not an inventor,

565
00:44:41,181 --> 00:44:44,661
but I did develop a new way
of irrigating dry land

566
00:44:44,733 --> 00:44:47,580
so that no one in my kingdom
ever has to be hungry.

567
00:44:47,645 --> 00:44:48,757
Oh.

568
00:44:50,685 --> 00:44:52,660
Mr. Fogg invented wheelie shoes.

569
00:44:55,997 --> 00:44:57,819
Not now, Passepartout.

570
00:44:59,933 --> 00:45:01,656
Oh.

571
00:45:01,724 --> 00:45:03,131
Mmm.

572
00:45:03,196 --> 00:45:04,658
- Miss La Roche.
- Hmm?

573
00:45:04,733 --> 00:45:08,759
It is mesmerizing,
the way your face illuminates.

574
00:45:08,829 --> 00:45:09,974
Oh...

575
00:45:10,045 --> 00:45:12,728
Her discoloration could be
an allergic reaction

576
00:45:12,796 --> 00:45:15,349
or a mild form of hives.

577
00:45:17,469 --> 00:45:20,633
Although I've noticed a certain

578
00:45:20,701 --> 00:45:24,246
luminescent glow about her
complexion when she's drawing.

579
00:45:24,349 --> 00:45:28,692
And sometimes, when she's...
concentrating on her latest work,

580
00:45:28,797 --> 00:45:31,252
her ears will actually flutter.

581
00:45:33,885 --> 00:45:38,293
- It's rather fetching.
- Guess who else was in this bath.

582
00:45:38,364 --> 00:45:41,299
U.S. President Rutherford B. Hayes.

583
00:45:43,037 --> 00:45:45,623
Shouldn't we be going?
We have a schedule to keep.

584
00:45:45,693 --> 00:45:47,667
Thank you for your hospitality.

585
00:45:47,741 --> 00:45:51,287
It's been absolutely fascinating,
but I'm afraid we must push on.

586
00:45:51,357 --> 00:45:52,339
Yes.

587
00:45:52,445 --> 00:45:54,333
Very well.
The gentlemen are free to go.

588
00:45:54,365 --> 00:45:57,714
But Miss La Roche...
stays here with me.

589
00:45:58,364 --> 00:46:00,274
- To be my wife.
- Hmm?

590
00:46:00,381 --> 00:46:02,869
Yes. Wife number seven.

591
00:46:03,581 --> 00:46:06,712
- You have seven wives?
- One for each day of the week.

592
00:46:09,213 --> 00:46:12,508
- This is absolutely ridiculous!
- No more talk!

593
00:46:12,572 --> 00:46:13,979
Prince Hapi has spoken!

594
00:46:16,573 --> 00:46:20,020
Well, we did say one drink.
Passepartout, we're leaving.

595
00:46:20,092 --> 00:46:22,132
I can tell when we're not wanted.

596
00:46:26,141 --> 00:46:27,089
Monsieur Fogg!

597
00:46:28,284 --> 00:46:30,456
Do Tuesdays work for you?

598
00:46:31,453 --> 00:46:34,104
- Good-bye.
- Thank you!

599
00:46:37,917 --> 00:46:40,251
No!

600
00:46:41,245 --> 00:46:42,260
Halt!

601
00:46:42,813 --> 00:46:44,340
Or Hapi gets smashed!

602
00:46:44,413 --> 00:46:48,373
Please! Anything but my statue of me!

603
00:46:48,444 --> 00:46:51,827
Miss La Roche,
please join us, if you will.

604
00:46:53,181 --> 00:46:57,458
- All of you, drop your weapons.
- Do as he says!

605
00:46:58,748 --> 00:47:01,334
- Get in the tent.
- Everybody!

606
00:47:01,437 --> 00:47:04,698
- Now!
- Let's go. Come on.

607
00:47:10,909 --> 00:47:15,065
Now, take off your clothes
and throw them... Uh...

608
00:47:15,133 --> 00:47:18,907
I assure you the statue is not
armed... harmed in any way.

609
00:47:33,853 --> 00:47:36,635
Get them!

610
00:47:39,485 --> 00:47:40,859
His arm!

611
00:47:42,108 --> 00:47:44,280
Thank you, Phileas.
That was very heroic.

612
00:47:44,349 --> 00:47:46,902
Yes, and needlessly time-consuming.

613
00:47:46,973 --> 00:47:50,104
This is exactly why
I should never have let you come along.

614
00:47:50,173 --> 00:47:51,351
Kill them!

615
00:47:51,996 --> 00:47:55,542
I want my arm!

616
00:47:55,613 --> 00:47:58,613
No!

617
00:47:58,685 --> 00:48:02,263
Sir! I've received a telegram
from Inspector Fix.

618
00:48:02,364 --> 00:48:04,469
- A-ha!
- According to him,

619
00:48:04,573 --> 00:48:07,672
the bank thief and Fogg's valet
are the same man.

620
00:48:07,741 --> 00:48:10,675
Fogg doesn't realize
he's transporting the bank thief!

621
00:48:10,748 --> 00:48:14,938
Or does he?
He did leave town in quite a hurry.

622
00:48:15,004 --> 00:48:16,892
Wouldn't you say, Lord Rhodes?

623
00:48:16,956 --> 00:48:18,811
Indeed, Lord Salisbury.

624
00:48:18,876 --> 00:48:20,818
Eh, evading arrest,

625
00:48:20,893 --> 00:48:23,162
stealing a police vehicle,

626
00:48:23,228 --> 00:48:25,846
sounds rather incriminating to me.

627
00:48:25,916 --> 00:48:27,739
One can almost deduce

628
00:48:27,805 --> 00:48:30,456
this entire bet was merely a ruse

629
00:48:30,525 --> 00:48:32,532
to facilitate his escape.

630
00:48:33,276 --> 00:48:36,986
- Don't you agree, Lord Kelvin?
- Yes.

631
00:48:37,053 --> 00:48:38,613
Brilliant, Lord Salisbury.

632
00:48:38,717 --> 00:48:42,361
I shall name a beef-related entrée
after you in your honor! Kitchner!

633
00:48:42,428 --> 00:48:44,436
- Sir!
- Inform your men at Scotland Yard

634
00:48:44,508 --> 00:48:49,691
that Phileas Fogg is without a doubt
the man who robbed the Bank of England!

635
00:48:49,789 --> 00:48:53,171
- Where are they now?
- They're taking a train across India,

636
00:48:53,213 --> 00:48:54,707
from Bombay to Calcutta.

637
00:48:54,781 --> 00:48:56,952
Thank God we own India!

638
00:48:57,021 --> 00:48:59,290
I want their faces
in every police station,

639
00:48:59,356 --> 00:49:01,745
army barracks, post office,
railway station and outhouse in India!

640
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:06,453
We're going to stop Fogg
and get my Jade Buddha back

641
00:49:06,557 --> 00:49:09,175
by any means necessary!

642
00:49:16,732 --> 00:49:19,220
Agra is where we will capture them!

643
00:49:27,133 --> 00:49:29,369
Intercept them at Agra!

644
00:49:29,437 --> 00:49:31,095
Carry on, Cutter!

645
00:49:31,165 --> 00:49:33,499
Move it! Move it! Fall in!

646
00:49:44,124 --> 00:49:46,841
And they were
the greatest kung fu boxers.

647
00:49:46,941 --> 00:49:49,363
Ten Tigers of Canton.

648
00:49:49,405 --> 00:49:50,681
Brothers in arms.

649
00:49:50,748 --> 00:49:53,399
They fought to keep order
and justice in China.

650
00:49:53,468 --> 00:49:56,785
The most famous of Ten Tigers
is Wong Fei Hung.

651
00:50:01,437 --> 00:50:03,804
Armed with
only bamboo sticks...

652
00:50:03,869 --> 00:50:05,844
It's salivating on... please.

653
00:50:05,917 --> 00:50:07,345
Is this your goat?

654
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:09,493
Did they really fight like tigers?

655
00:50:09,596 --> 00:50:12,695
Each Tiger have their own
animal fighting style.

656
00:50:12,797 --> 00:50:15,001
Like tiger.

657
00:50:15,069 --> 00:50:18,003
Snake. Snake head, snake tail,
snake mouth, snake tongue!

658
00:50:19,005 --> 00:50:20,663
Where are my calculations?

659
00:50:20,733 --> 00:50:22,074
Monkey!

660
00:50:23,101 --> 00:50:26,581
The goat! Passepartout, I'm being
attacked by a ferocious animal!

661
00:50:27,676 --> 00:50:30,578
- It has small horns.
- Sorry, Mr. Fogg.

662
00:50:30,652 --> 00:50:33,434
Please keep that inconsiderate
beast away from me.

663
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:35,475
And refrain from ridiculous anecdotes.

664
00:50:35,549 --> 00:50:38,331
Why do you not like his story, Mr. Frog?

665
00:50:38,877 --> 00:50:40,535
It's Fogg. Phileas Fogg.

666
00:50:41,212 --> 00:50:45,435
How could a man learn to defend himself
by watching animals behave like...

667
00:50:45,533 --> 00:50:47,834
- animals?
- It is famous legend.

668
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:51,697
- A ridiculous legend.
- Most legends are born from truth.

669
00:50:51,805 --> 00:50:53,495
Yes.

670
00:50:53,564 --> 00:50:56,881
But all truths are born from facts.

671
00:50:56,957 --> 00:50:59,542
Solid, tangible facts
that can be calculated

672
00:50:59,612 --> 00:51:01,270
and written down on paper.

673
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:05,017
And then eaten by a goat.

674
00:51:05,084 --> 00:51:08,019
Mr. Feelsillious,
when I tell the story

675
00:51:08,092 --> 00:51:11,223
of the man who circled
the entire world in 80 days,

676
00:51:11,292 --> 00:51:13,529
would that not be a legend?

677
00:51:16,284 --> 00:51:18,870
Only if the man's name
was Feelsillious Frog.

678
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:27,893
- What the blazes is it now?
- Come this way! Come on!

679
00:51:27,964 --> 00:51:30,714
Look sharp, now. Get 'em!

680
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:32,274
Find these men!

681
00:51:32,348 --> 00:51:37,170
Uh-oh. Time to go. They seem to think
we robbed the Bank of England.

682
00:51:37,244 --> 00:51:40,244
Preposterous. This is a desperate
attempt by Lord Kelvin

683
00:51:40,348 --> 00:51:41,461
to impede my journey.

684
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:43,889
I am a British citizen.
I have nothing to fear.

685
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:48,049
Except bullets.

686
00:51:49,053 --> 00:51:51,257
Listen up!
Have you seen these men?

687
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:54,867
Come on!

688
00:52:06,749 --> 00:52:08,604
Any word on the bank thieves, sir?

689
00:52:08,669 --> 00:52:11,189
They were on the train.
Keep your rifles ready.

690
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:12,722
They won't get past us, sir!

691
00:52:14,652 --> 00:52:17,205
Ladies, have you seen these two men?

692
00:52:18,557 --> 00:52:21,786
Look closely. They're very dangerous.

693
00:52:21,853 --> 00:52:24,755
They're everywhere!
This is not going to work!

694
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:28,308
- Just act like ladies.
- Not a problem.

695
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:31,097
Hello. Hello! Ah.

696
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:35,511
- I feel faint.
- Phileas, women are not that weak!

697
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:37,653
No, but I am.

698
00:52:43,868 --> 00:52:47,032
Hello, darling.
What can I do for you, eh?

699
00:52:51,261 --> 00:52:56,050
What nice hand,
nice eye, nice hair...

700
00:52:57,052 --> 00:52:59,092
Hang about!

701
00:53:02,332 --> 00:53:05,201
Mr. Fogg, what are you doing?
This is no time to sleep.

702
00:53:05,276 --> 00:53:06,902
Stop, stop.

703
00:53:09,052 --> 00:53:12,827
Go, go, go! Get us out of Agra quickly.

704
00:53:12,892 --> 00:53:15,096
Passepartout, we did it.

705
00:53:20,188 --> 00:53:22,098
Hey, wrong way.

706
00:53:22,204 --> 00:53:23,382
Ah!

707
00:53:27,837 --> 00:53:29,909
Phileas? No! No!

708
00:53:34,109 --> 00:53:36,214
Aah! Run! Run, Passepartout!

709
00:53:36,316 --> 00:53:37,909
Ah! Ah!

710
00:53:37,949 --> 00:53:39,509
Ahhh!

711
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:41,336
Fogg's valet! Heh!

712
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:44,023
- What are you doing?
- Now I gotcha!

713
00:53:44,509 --> 00:53:46,102
Hand over the Jade Buddha!

714
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:48,369
Oh!

715
00:53:50,269 --> 00:53:53,946
You're under arrest! Whoa!
Watch me plums! Ooh!

716
00:53:58,364 --> 00:54:02,008
Now you get him very mad! Let's go.

717
00:54:02,076 --> 00:54:04,181
Stop, or I'll arrest you as well!

718
00:54:12,828 --> 00:54:14,738
Run!

719
00:54:16,028 --> 00:54:18,133
- Which way?
- Down!

720
00:54:18,204 --> 00:54:20,114
Again!

721
00:54:21,436 --> 00:54:22,647
Down!

722
00:54:25,181 --> 00:54:26,260
Jump!

723
00:54:29,724 --> 00:54:32,507
- Go, go, go!
- What's upsetting him?

724
00:54:32,604 --> 00:54:35,321
- He wants the Jade Buddha!
- Then give it to him!

725
00:54:39,004 --> 00:54:42,681
- Phileas, wake up!
- Please, please. You must go.

726
00:54:43,644 --> 00:54:47,419
- My husband will be home soon.
- Phileas!

727
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:01,468
Ow! Ay!

728
00:55:05,212 --> 00:55:06,805
Phileas, help!

729
00:55:06,876 --> 00:55:08,698
Leave her alone! I'll protect you!

730
00:55:08,764 --> 00:55:10,619
Ah!

731
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:13,074
I'm here, my dear.

732
00:55:13,148 --> 00:55:16,050
Uh, that stumble was
simply to buy me time.

733
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:20,184
This cane is not as it appears.

734
00:55:20,252 --> 00:55:24,857
If I depress this button, it would
deploy a weapon more deadly than yours.

735
00:55:28,316 --> 00:55:30,705
This... is...

736
00:55:30,812 --> 00:55:33,365
a strange knife.

737
00:55:33,468 --> 00:55:34,875
Isn't it a sextant?

738
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:37,627
Yes.

739
00:55:44,061 --> 00:55:45,467
Huh.

740
00:55:49,372 --> 00:55:53,714
- Are you all right, my dear?
- Phileas, that was so unlike you. Ah!

741
00:55:53,788 --> 00:55:55,643
You men, come with me!

742
00:55:55,708 --> 00:55:58,807
You'd better put this on.

743
00:55:58,876 --> 00:56:01,527
Perhaps I should wear
women's clothing more often.

744
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:07,890
Oh.

745
00:56:07,996 --> 00:56:09,458
We should run.

746
00:56:09,564 --> 00:56:11,419
- What, now?
- Mm-hmm.

747
00:56:12,380 --> 00:56:13,874
Yes, we should run.

748
00:56:18,044 --> 00:56:20,051
- Break down the door!
- Okay.

749
00:56:21,404 --> 00:56:22,581
No, not me brains!

750
00:56:34,652 --> 00:56:37,019
- Give me the Jade "Bu-ddha"!
- Okay, okay.

751
00:56:37,116 --> 00:56:38,806
What's "Bu-ddha"?

752
00:56:41,148 --> 00:56:43,767
Get ready to jump! Now!

753
00:56:57,052 --> 00:57:00,183
It is him, the Englishman
who robbed the Bank of England!

754
00:57:00,252 --> 00:57:02,838
He's escaping in that palkee-garry!

755
00:57:02,908 --> 00:57:05,177
Hey, there he is!

756
00:57:06,556 --> 00:57:08,978
They'll check all trains heading east.

757
00:57:09,084 --> 00:57:13,274
If we could make it to the coast, we
can't sail into Singapore or Hong Kong.

758
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:16,537
- They're both British colonies.
- Does England own everything in Asia?

759
00:57:16,604 --> 00:57:19,920
Not China. Not yet.

760
00:58:11,868 --> 00:58:13,210
Passepartout?

761
00:58:14,492 --> 00:58:19,347
- You look troubled.
- I cannot keep lying to Mr. Fogg.

762
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:21,013
You did what you had to.

763
00:58:21,084 --> 00:58:23,506
The fate of your village
is of far greater importance

764
00:58:23,612 --> 00:58:26,329
than any bet Phileas has made.

765
00:58:26,364 --> 00:58:29,495
If he loses, all it will
cost him his money and pride.

766
00:58:29,564 --> 00:58:32,880
No, Mr. Fogg will lose
much more than that.

767
00:58:33,788 --> 00:58:36,657
What do you mean?

768
00:58:41,052 --> 00:58:43,092
My village!

769
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:49,686
- Your village?
- Uh... I mean,

770
00:58:49,756 --> 00:58:51,610
my, what a village!

771
00:58:51,676 --> 00:58:53,083
Oh, it's beautiful!

772
00:58:54,428 --> 00:58:57,298
We do need to stop and
resupply, but we must be off by morning.

773
00:59:16,764 --> 00:59:18,652
- Lau Xing, Lau Xing.
- Lau Xing, Lau Xing.

774
00:59:18,748 --> 00:59:21,334
Lau Xing.

775
00:59:21,436 --> 00:59:24,534
- Lau Xing.
- Lau Xing.

776
00:59:33,468 --> 00:59:37,046
Goodness, that's quite a welcome.
Do these people know him?

777
00:59:37,116 --> 00:59:40,793
It must be their custom,
the way they welcome all strangers.

778
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:42,867
- Lau Xing.
- Lau Xing.

779
00:59:57,148 --> 00:59:59,352
Whoo!

780
01:00:00,764 --> 01:00:01,811
Lau Xing.

781
01:00:13,371 --> 01:00:14,800
Lau Xing.

782
01:00:16,603 --> 01:00:18,294
Lau Xing.

783
01:00:20,252 --> 01:00:21,812
Ah. Uh...

784
01:00:47,484 --> 01:00:48,890
Oh. It's beautiful.

785
01:00:48,956 --> 01:00:50,843
You are very talented.

786
01:00:50,908 --> 01:00:52,217
Thank you.

787
01:00:53,435 --> 01:00:55,345
You need more blue.

788
01:01:01,884 --> 01:01:04,534
Fascinating. Absolutely fascinating.

789
01:01:07,068 --> 01:01:09,370
Sorry?

790
01:01:18,364 --> 01:01:19,378
Vile.

791
01:01:19,452 --> 01:01:22,267
Absolutely vile.

792
01:01:30,364 --> 01:01:32,219
Welcome home, Lau Xing.

793
01:01:35,772 --> 01:01:37,496
Your brothers will be proud.

794
01:01:37,564 --> 01:01:40,281
The whole notion of
a lighter-than-air craft cannot work,

795
01:01:40,348 --> 01:01:42,868
unless you can
harness the power of helium.

796
01:01:42,940 --> 01:01:44,882
Or hydrogen, which is far better...

797
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:50,169
Yes, well, couldn't have
put it better myself.

798
01:01:50,235 --> 01:01:55,091
As for this Englishman, do you think
such an association is wise?

799
01:01:55,196 --> 01:01:58,229
He is the most disciplined man
I have ever met.

800
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:00,987
The crane!

801
01:02:01,052 --> 01:02:03,091
The monkey. Very frightening.

802
01:02:04,123 --> 01:02:06,938
Snake.

803
01:02:07,003 --> 01:02:09,425
And, of course, the eagle.

804
01:02:12,476 --> 01:02:13,523
Phileas?

805
01:02:15,516 --> 01:02:18,680
Phileas, I made this for you.

806
01:02:18,748 --> 01:02:23,003
Oh, yes.
Oh, that's very, very good. Yes.

807
01:02:23,068 --> 01:02:24,213
What does this say?

808
01:02:24,283 --> 01:02:27,153
Stupid.

809
01:02:29,276 --> 01:02:30,650
Lau Xing...

810
01:02:57,628 --> 01:02:59,570
I've had quite enough.

811
01:02:59,676 --> 01:03:01,618
I just... I...

812
01:03:27,612 --> 01:03:28,659
Ahhh.

813
01:03:28,732 --> 01:03:31,928
I am going to be abominably ill.

814
01:03:45,083 --> 01:03:47,418
I... I want to die.

815
01:03:48,380 --> 01:03:50,485
Please kill me.

816
01:04:22,588 --> 01:04:24,759
"Dear Father:

817
01:04:24,828 --> 01:04:27,861
I will find the fastest way to China."

818
01:04:31,548 --> 01:04:33,206
It's strong.

819
01:04:41,244 --> 01:04:43,862
Mr. Fogg, I was going to tell you.

820
01:04:49,436 --> 01:04:53,298
- This is your family.
- My name is not Passepartout.

821
01:04:53,372 --> 01:04:55,063
It is Lau Xing.

822
01:04:55,836 --> 01:05:00,570
- I robbed the Bank of England.
- You robbed the Bank of England?

823
01:05:00,636 --> 01:05:04,214
Not for gold or money,
but for the Jade Buddha.

824
01:05:04,284 --> 01:05:06,651
It was stolen from our village.

825
01:05:06,748 --> 01:05:12,279
Phileas, he had no other choice.
This was his only way to get home.

826
01:05:15,163 --> 01:05:18,392
- You knew about this?
- Well...

827
01:05:20,092 --> 01:05:22,645
I have nothing but respect
for you, Mr. Fogg.

828
01:05:24,796 --> 01:05:27,381
Then respect my deductive reasoning.

829
01:05:27,451 --> 01:05:30,517
You have both used me.

830
01:05:30,587 --> 01:05:32,376
You to escape to China,

831
01:05:32,443 --> 01:05:35,509
and you to travel to further
your impressionistic humbug!

832
01:05:35,835 --> 01:05:38,967
Your overtures of... comradeship,

833
01:05:39,067 --> 01:05:41,009
of friendship, of...

834
01:05:45,179 --> 01:05:48,179
All that was a means to ensure
I would take you along.

835
01:05:48,252 --> 01:05:52,408
My entire life,
I got along splendidly by myself.

836
01:05:52,476 --> 01:05:56,370
You've been pebbles in my shoe,
slowing me down, endangering my life,

837
01:05:57,467 --> 01:06:00,402
risking everything,
all I've ever lived for.

838
01:06:00,476 --> 01:06:02,264
And you!

839
01:06:03,612 --> 01:06:05,205
You knew that.

840
01:06:18,108 --> 01:06:21,206
Don't let him go.
He'll be lost by midnight.

841
01:06:21,852 --> 01:06:23,445
Go!

842
01:06:27,196 --> 01:06:30,392
More of your relatives, I suppose.

843
01:06:35,195 --> 01:06:38,228
You can just forget
about a reference.

844
01:06:38,299 --> 01:06:41,682
I beg a thousand pardons, Mr. Fogg.

845
01:06:50,684 --> 01:06:52,593
What's he screaming about?

846
01:06:52,668 --> 01:06:55,123
He's saying, "Please, let me go.
I'm bored."

847
01:06:58,395 --> 01:07:00,337
Why is he in prison?

848
01:07:06,779 --> 01:07:08,950
Urinating in public.

849
01:07:09,019 --> 01:07:11,736
Charming.

850
01:07:11,804 --> 01:07:14,803
At least he had the decency
to be forthcoming about it.

851
01:07:14,908 --> 01:07:17,755
Is there anything you've told me
that's even remotely true?

852
01:07:17,851 --> 01:07:19,477
I really can sing.

853
01:07:20,252 --> 01:07:23,219
# Frère Jacques, Frère Jacques

854
01:07:23,292 --> 01:07:25,048
# Dormez-vous

855
01:07:25,115 --> 01:07:26,489
# Dormez-vous

856
01:07:26,555 --> 01:07:29,206
# Sonnez les matines
Sonnez les matines

857
01:07:29,275 --> 01:07:31,577
# Ding, ding, ding
Ding, ding, ding #

858
01:07:31,643 --> 01:07:34,578
Ding, dang, dong, Passepartout.
Ding, dang, dong.

859
01:07:34,652 --> 01:07:36,921
Look!

860
01:07:39,483 --> 01:07:44,153
Oh, good. Here comes
Mr. Grumpy and the Leatherettes.

861
01:07:49,787 --> 01:07:53,911
- Where is the Jade Buddha?
- You are better off killing me.

862
01:07:55,068 --> 01:07:59,224
You have nerve.
Are your comrades so brave?

863
01:07:59,964 --> 01:08:03,225
Your threats don't frighten me.
Nor does your silly bracelet.

864
01:08:04,828 --> 01:08:07,511
All right. It's not silly.

865
01:08:07,579 --> 01:08:11,409
I spit on you! France spits on you!

866
01:08:11,484 --> 01:08:12,858
Vive I'Anjou!

867
01:08:13,820 --> 01:08:16,569
- Your turn will come soon enough.
- Coward!

868
01:08:16,636 --> 01:08:19,483
Leave them alone. Fight me.

869
01:08:19,547 --> 01:08:21,522
Yes, fight him.

870
01:08:22,396 --> 01:08:24,730
Let's see how ferocious you really are.

871
01:09:10,843 --> 01:09:12,818
Hey, that's cheating!

872
01:09:14,107 --> 01:09:15,896
- Look out!
- Huh?

873
01:09:15,964 --> 01:09:18,004
Left!

874
01:09:21,724 --> 01:09:23,033
Behind you!

875
01:09:26,172 --> 01:09:27,797
No!

876
01:09:27,867 --> 01:09:30,999
- Hit them!
- Silence!

877
01:09:36,539 --> 01:09:37,717
You savages!

878
01:09:39,227 --> 01:09:40,721
Phileas, help him!

879
01:09:40,795 --> 01:09:43,577
- Watch out on the right.
- Huh?

880
01:09:43,644 --> 01:09:45,072
No, my right.

881
01:09:46,172 --> 01:09:47,546
Stop helping me!

882
01:09:47,611 --> 01:09:49,400
What's happening?

883
01:09:49,468 --> 01:09:50,744
Where is Passepartout?

884
01:09:50,811 --> 01:09:52,240
How is he getting on?

885
01:09:52,315 --> 01:09:56,406
I wouldn't say he's winning,
but, uh, I think he's doing all right.

886
01:10:04,220 --> 01:10:06,292
Go home to mama.

887
01:10:20,123 --> 01:10:22,295
Huh?

888
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:26,642
- What took you so long?
- I had to finish my lunch.

889
01:10:36,315 --> 01:10:37,297
Wong Fei Hung!

890
01:10:38,268 --> 01:10:41,977
Surely you're not foolish enough
to take on all of my men by yourself?

891
01:10:47,355 --> 01:10:48,370
Ten Tigers?

892
01:10:56,475 --> 01:10:58,166
Kill them!

893
01:11:08,284 --> 01:11:11,382
Execute the prisoners!
I want their heads on pikes!

894
01:11:23,323 --> 01:11:25,145
What's happening?

895
01:11:25,883 --> 01:11:27,443
Phileas!

896
01:11:33,723 --> 01:11:35,130
Ohhh!

897
01:11:36,955 --> 01:11:38,777
Passepartout... Knife!

898
01:11:49,659 --> 01:11:51,732
- Merci.
- You're welcome.

899
01:13:10,812 --> 01:13:15,219
You promise me that Black Scorpions
will never come back to Lanzhou.

900
01:13:35,068 --> 01:13:38,613
These are my brothers and sister.
The Ten Tigers.

901
01:13:38,715 --> 01:13:41,748
- But there are only nine.
- Including me.

902
01:13:41,851 --> 01:13:43,225
They're real.

903
01:13:44,283 --> 01:13:45,843
The legend was true.

904
01:14:31,867 --> 01:14:34,071
- Mr. Fogg...
- Passepartout,

905
01:14:34,139 --> 01:14:36,473
or whatever your name is,
save your apologies.

906
01:14:36,539 --> 01:14:40,249
Phileas, he risked his life
for what he believes in.

907
01:14:40,315 --> 01:14:42,322
If anyone understands that, you do.

908
01:14:42,427 --> 01:14:45,842
Please ensure Miss La Roche
finds safe passage home.

909
01:14:45,947 --> 01:14:48,697
This should be adequate.

910
01:14:52,923 --> 01:14:54,330
Oh.

911
01:14:54,395 --> 01:14:57,111
I, uh, believe this is your veil.

912
01:15:01,051 --> 01:15:04,085
I will never dress like a woman again.

913
01:15:05,467 --> 01:15:07,321
Ever.

914
01:15:07,387 --> 01:15:10,648
Mr. Fogg.
Please let me help you win your bet.

915
01:15:12,059 --> 01:15:15,801
I have secured the services
of a more reliable gentleman.

916
01:15:27,451 --> 01:15:29,425
Yes. Well, perhaps I'll just, uh,

917
01:15:29,499 --> 01:15:31,092
travel alone.

918
01:16:21,115 --> 01:16:24,912
Fifi La Belle!
She sings! She dances!

919
01:16:25,019 --> 01:16:28,499
She does the dance of the...
You, sir, come right in.

920
01:16:28,571 --> 01:16:31,189
See Miss Fifi La Belle in all her...

921
01:16:31,259 --> 01:16:35,601
Ah, the most modern city in the world.

922
01:16:35,675 --> 01:16:38,490
Finally, civilization.

923
01:16:45,147 --> 01:16:47,668
Excuse me. Pardon me.

924
01:16:47,739 --> 01:16:51,568
Can anyone direct me
to the Pacific Railroad Station?

925
01:16:54,363 --> 01:16:56,250
Oh, I'm so sorry, sir.

926
01:16:56,347 --> 01:16:59,380
I'm such a... rutabaga sometimes.

927
01:16:59,450 --> 01:17:01,785
No, no, no.
Please, it's my fault entirely.

928
01:17:01,851 --> 01:17:05,015
- Let me, uh...
- Oh... Ah!

929
01:17:05,083 --> 01:17:07,865
Oh. Oh, Lord,
I think I sprained my knee.

930
01:17:07,931 --> 01:17:09,873
Uh! Ooh.

931
01:17:09,947 --> 01:17:12,052
I should find you a physician.

932
01:17:12,123 --> 01:17:14,741
There's a doctor who has
an office around the corner.

933
01:17:14,810 --> 01:17:18,356
Excellent.
Well, uh, I'll get him for you.

934
01:17:18,427 --> 01:17:19,507
Thank you.

935
01:17:19,579 --> 01:17:22,874
There should be more people
like you in this world.

936
01:17:24,987 --> 01:17:27,704
Whoo, doggy! Jackpot!

937
01:17:31,611 --> 01:17:34,164
Whoo!

938
01:17:43,035 --> 01:17:44,628
Mon Dieu.

939
01:17:44,699 --> 01:17:48,048
Can you imagine Phileas alone
in a place like this?

940
01:17:48,123 --> 01:17:49,617
I'm sure he's fine.

941
01:17:51,099 --> 01:17:53,652
Alms.

942
01:17:53,723 --> 01:17:55,511
Alms.

943
01:17:56,794 --> 01:17:58,518
Alms for the poor?

944
01:18:02,939 --> 01:18:04,051
Arms?

945
01:18:05,115 --> 01:18:08,530
You already got arms.
It's money you need.

946
01:18:09,403 --> 01:18:12,502
I can't even scrounge proficiently.

947
01:18:12,571 --> 01:18:13,945
Hey.

948
01:18:14,523 --> 01:18:18,101
Cheer up, pal. You just gotta
figure out what'll work for you.

949
01:18:18,170 --> 01:18:22,164
Now, what makes you
different from them?

950
01:18:22,235 --> 01:18:24,504
I'm hungry and miserable.

951
01:18:24,571 --> 01:18:27,124
No. You stink.

952
01:18:27,770 --> 01:18:31,960
Your stink is your most powerful weapon
in your begging arsenal.

953
01:18:32,059 --> 01:18:33,685
Watch this.

954
01:18:36,154 --> 01:18:37,878
Hey.

955
01:18:37,947 --> 01:18:40,435
- Give me money.
- Sure. Don't touch me. You stink.

956
01:18:41,947 --> 01:18:44,794
- That guy smells like a dead horse!
- I'm not proud of it.

957
01:18:44,859 --> 01:18:47,509
Simple, yet effective.

958
01:18:47,578 --> 01:18:49,007
- Yeah, I see.
- You try.

959
01:18:49,083 --> 01:18:52,018
Give it a shot. I got faith in you.

960
01:18:52,795 --> 01:18:56,723
Excuse me. Now, uh, you...

961
01:19:00,027 --> 01:19:00,975
Ah.

962
01:19:01,083 --> 01:19:04,792
I'm not gonna lie to you.
That's gonna happen about half the time.

963
01:19:07,355 --> 01:19:09,264
It's a volume business.

964
01:19:11,355 --> 01:19:14,388
- Hunk of cheese?
- Oh, yes, I would rather...

965
01:19:14,458 --> 01:19:15,985
Maybe later.

966
01:19:17,467 --> 01:19:20,282
What are them drawings?
You some kind of devil worshipper?

967
01:19:21,115 --> 01:19:23,570
Don't you be putting a hex on me.
I'll cut you.

968
01:19:24,891 --> 01:19:27,825
- I'm an inventor.
- That's nice.

969
01:19:27,898 --> 01:19:30,135
Or, rather, I was.

970
01:19:38,523 --> 01:19:41,818
One day I will build a machine
that will allow man to fly.

971
01:19:42,459 --> 01:19:44,695
Flying men? Where?

972
01:19:45,882 --> 01:19:49,428
- Nowhere.
- Where are the flying men?

973
01:19:49,499 --> 01:19:51,571
- Where are the flying men?
- Over there.

974
01:19:51,642 --> 01:19:53,846
The bird men are coming! I knew it!

975
01:19:53,914 --> 01:19:56,849
The bird men are coming!
The bird men are coming!

976
01:19:56,923 --> 01:19:59,192
The birds! The bird men!

977
01:19:59,259 --> 01:20:01,146
Bird men! Birds!

978
01:20:09,979 --> 01:20:13,045
"I traveled the world for inspiration

979
01:20:13,114 --> 01:20:17,784
and found it in a man...
who lives what he dreams."

980
01:20:56,986 --> 01:20:59,921
- Phileas?
- No.

981
01:21:00,795 --> 01:21:03,216
Passepartout! Monique!

982
01:21:05,659 --> 01:21:06,674
Mr. Fogg.

983
01:21:09,083 --> 01:21:12,858
You crossed the Pacific Ocean.
For me?

984
01:21:12,923 --> 01:21:16,851
- We will help you win your bet.
- Mr. Fogg, I would never let you down.

985
01:21:17,850 --> 01:21:21,199
- But why would you do this?
- Because you are our friend,

986
01:21:21,274 --> 01:21:24,024
and perhaps... more.

987
01:21:25,563 --> 01:21:29,043
More with her. You and me?
We just stick with friends.

988
01:21:31,034 --> 01:21:32,595
- Ooh.
- Oof!

989
01:21:32,667 --> 01:21:36,693
Lord Kelvin, I can
offer you something much more precious

990
01:21:36,763 --> 01:21:38,835
than a single Jade Buddha.

991
01:21:38,907 --> 01:21:42,584
Beneath Lanzhou are a series
of untapped jade reserves.

992
01:21:42,683 --> 01:21:47,287
If the town were to be overrun,
those reserves would be ours.

993
01:21:47,354 --> 01:21:48,467
I see.

994
01:21:48,539 --> 01:21:51,572
However, should Phileas Fogg
win this race,

995
01:21:51,642 --> 01:21:56,432
I will have neither the power nor
the means to hand over any arsenal.

996
01:21:56,506 --> 01:22:01,525
Then I will see to it personally
that Mr. Fogg's journey is cut short.

997
01:22:01,594 --> 01:22:05,620
Very well.
Let us consider our deal to be...

998
01:22:07,866 --> 01:22:10,714
Still, it's a first-rate idea, sir.

999
01:22:10,779 --> 01:22:14,935
What's this blocking my jade reserves?
That will have to be demolished.

1000
01:22:15,034 --> 01:22:16,311
But that is
the Great Wall of China, sir.

1001
01:22:16,379 --> 01:22:18,266
But that is
the Great Wall of China, sir.

1002
01:22:19,323 --> 01:22:20,916
It's not that great.

1003
01:22:30,843 --> 01:22:34,039
Passepartout went
to get help hours ago.

1004
01:22:34,107 --> 01:22:36,343
What if he's lost, or...

1005
01:22:36,410 --> 01:22:38,134
Don't fret, my dear.

1006
01:22:38,203 --> 01:22:42,294
Passepartout's a warrior
with impeccable survival instincts.

1007
01:22:42,363 --> 01:22:46,356
No doubt he'll return with help, and we
will board our train with time to spare.

1008
01:22:46,459 --> 01:22:47,866
Agua.

1009
01:22:48,858 --> 01:22:51,542
Perhaps I'm being a little optimistic.

1010
01:22:51,611 --> 01:22:52,821
Help!

1011
01:22:52,890 --> 01:22:54,712
- Help us!
- Help!

1012
01:22:54,779 --> 01:22:56,786
Ah! A rattlesnake!

1013
01:22:56,859 --> 01:22:57,841
Help!

1014
01:22:57,915 --> 01:23:00,086
I don't want to die!

1015
01:23:00,154 --> 01:23:02,293
Ah. Good morning.

1016
01:23:04,154 --> 01:23:05,845
- Howdy.
- Hey.

1017
01:23:05,914 --> 01:23:08,216
Crazy English cowboy wannabe man.

1018
01:23:08,283 --> 01:23:12,058
How's about going someplace else?
You're blocking the path.

1019
01:23:12,123 --> 01:23:14,032
Wilbur, it's him.

1020
01:23:15,899 --> 01:23:17,076
I'll be damned.

1021
01:23:18,650 --> 01:23:22,327
Mr. Fogg, my name is Orville Wright.
This is my brother, Wilbur.

1022
01:23:22,394 --> 01:23:25,689
- We're big fans of yours.
- Fan's a strong word.

1023
01:23:25,786 --> 01:23:30,358
Better way to say it's we got a lot
of money riding on you to win your bet.

1024
01:23:30,426 --> 01:23:32,663
We're gonna use
our winnings to build this.

1025
01:23:33,179 --> 01:23:35,993
Orville, maybe now is not the time.
Let me explain it to Mr. Fogg.

1026
01:23:36,059 --> 01:23:40,598
Just one second. Forgive my brother.
He's got his head up in the clouds.

1027
01:23:40,667 --> 01:23:44,977
He's one of these dreamers who thinks
man's gonna go swooshing around

1028
01:23:45,051 --> 01:23:48,018
on the planet
like a little hummingbird.

1029
01:23:48,091 --> 01:23:50,741
Yeah, we're all gonna fly.
He thinks so, too.

1030
01:23:50,842 --> 01:23:53,712
It's kind of sad. I'm sorry.
He's kind of a moron.

1031
01:23:53,818 --> 01:23:58,073
He's mastered the cable steering system.
The drag-and-lift ratio.

1032
01:23:58,139 --> 01:24:00,048
- This is brilliant.
- Thank you.

1033
01:24:00,123 --> 01:24:02,992
That's what I've been saying,
but Orville doesn't listen.

1034
01:24:03,066 --> 01:24:05,881
All that stuff about mastering...
That's what I say.

1035
01:24:05,946 --> 01:24:09,688
You gotta have faith in me, no matter
how crazy big brother's dreams sound.

1036
01:24:09,754 --> 01:24:12,405
- But you told me...
- You gotta have confidence.

1037
01:24:12,474 --> 01:24:15,442
- You've got to speak up and support me.
- Excuse me, gentlemen.

1038
01:24:15,514 --> 01:24:17,903
Have you come across our friend
on your way here?

1039
01:24:18,938 --> 01:24:20,880
Who are we looking for?

1040
01:24:20,987 --> 01:24:22,034
Passepartout.

1041
01:24:22,907 --> 01:24:25,012
You mean the crazy,
half-naked Chinese guy

1042
01:24:25,114 --> 01:24:27,089
we saw running around,
where he was like...

1043
01:24:27,195 --> 01:24:29,813
- Singing "Frère Jacques"?
- With a cow skull on his head?

1044
01:24:30,331 --> 01:24:31,760
- Possibly.
- Yes.

1045
01:24:31,834 --> 01:24:35,096
- He's in the back of the wagon.
- Passepartout.

1046
01:24:35,162 --> 01:24:37,584
- You are alive!
- Is that you, Grandma?

1047
01:24:41,082 --> 01:24:43,449
- Bye-bye.
- Good luck. Go win the bet.

1048
01:24:43,515 --> 01:24:47,159
- No pressure, but you gotta win it.
- Bye.

1049
01:24:47,226 --> 01:24:51,056
Now, you see, to get the real
classy dames, you gotta invent stuff.

1050
01:24:51,130 --> 01:24:53,552
I did.

1051
01:24:53,658 --> 01:24:55,546
"I did"? What's with the "I did"?

1052
01:24:55,643 --> 01:24:58,741
We're the Wright Brothers.
We did. Now go.

1053
01:24:58,906 --> 01:25:01,721
Hyah!

1054
01:25:07,482 --> 01:25:12,403
They're not going to make it!

1055
01:25:24,986 --> 01:25:27,834
Ah-ha-ha! New York, New York!

1056
01:25:27,931 --> 01:25:30,298
So much to see! So little time!

1057
01:25:30,363 --> 01:25:32,632
Our steamer leaves in ten minutes!

1058
01:25:32,698 --> 01:25:34,585
Go, go, go! Go, go, go!

1059
01:25:43,930 --> 01:25:46,832
- We're never going to make it.
- Phileas Fogg?

1060
01:25:50,363 --> 01:25:52,729
Autograph this for me?
It's for the wife.

1061
01:25:52,795 --> 01:25:56,689
Certainly. This business about me
robbing the Bank of England...

1062
01:25:56,794 --> 01:25:59,063
Ah, I'm from Ireland. Nice goin'.

1063
01:26:00,987 --> 01:26:05,526
The boat. Follow me.
I know a shortcut. Make a lane!

1064
01:26:10,106 --> 01:26:11,961
Make a lane!

1065
01:26:20,442 --> 01:26:22,165
Where are we?

1066
01:26:22,811 --> 01:26:25,298
- Ah!
- Whoa!

1067
01:26:25,370 --> 01:26:29,527
- That's a big man.
- It is a lady. A French lady.

1068
01:26:29,754 --> 01:26:33,049
She looks like an evil
Chinese warlord to me.

1069
01:26:43,802 --> 01:26:46,584
Your journey has caused
quite a stir, Mr. Fogg,

1070
01:26:46,651 --> 01:26:48,505
but I'm afraid it ends here.

1071
01:26:48,571 --> 01:26:51,189
Leave them alone.
This has nothing to do with them.

1072
01:26:52,411 --> 01:26:54,712
On the contrary, Lau Xing,

1073
01:26:54,778 --> 01:26:59,001
Lord Kelvin and I have made
new arrangements to conquer Lanzhou.

1074
01:26:59,066 --> 01:27:00,976
Unfortunately for Mr. Fogg,

1075
01:27:01,082 --> 01:27:04,082
they entail his... permanent detour.

1076
01:27:04,187 --> 01:27:05,747
I knew Kelvin was duplicitous,

1077
01:27:05,851 --> 01:27:08,665
but to align himself
with such a little scoundrel!

1078
01:27:09,722 --> 01:27:12,373
You're not a scoundrel,
but you are quite small!

1079
01:27:14,426 --> 01:27:19,642
As in petite, but most definitely lethal
and generally very scary.

1080
01:27:21,242 --> 01:27:23,697
One, two...

1081
01:27:24,474 --> 01:27:26,547
- Go!
- Three!

1082
01:27:31,866 --> 01:27:34,005
- Go up there.
- Stop them.

1083
01:27:40,219 --> 01:27:42,586
Passepartout, my cane!

1084
01:27:45,754 --> 01:27:46,867
Uh, there.

1085
01:28:09,818 --> 01:28:12,885
Passepartout!
Help! We are trapped!

1086
01:28:28,954 --> 01:28:30,481
Help!

1087
01:28:33,498 --> 01:28:36,313
Passepartout! Help!

1088
01:28:53,818 --> 01:28:55,095
There you are!

1089
01:28:58,170 --> 01:29:00,537
You have a knife in your buttock.

1090
01:29:26,427 --> 01:29:28,598
It's the evil Chinese warlord!

1091
01:29:28,666 --> 01:29:29,975
- Ooh!
- Huh?

1092
01:29:30,042 --> 01:29:32,213
She's coming!

1093
01:29:35,067 --> 01:29:36,790
The boat!

1094
01:29:36,858 --> 01:29:39,640
Up there! Hurry! Go, go, go!

1095
01:29:40,634 --> 01:29:43,285
Go, Mr. Fogg. There's not much time.

1096
01:30:01,178 --> 01:30:03,415
Wait, wait! What am I thinking?

1097
01:30:03,514 --> 01:30:05,172
Passepartout can't defeat them.

1098
01:30:05,210 --> 01:30:07,315
He's nine Tigers short.

1099
01:30:09,530 --> 01:30:14,167
Phileas, I do believe you are becoming
the man of my dreams.

1100
01:30:14,266 --> 01:30:16,688
When this is over,
let's hope the arms and legs

1101
01:30:16,794 --> 01:30:19,609
of the man of your dreams
are still attached to the torso...

1102
01:30:19,674 --> 01:30:21,562
of the man of your dreams.

1103
01:30:47,610 --> 01:30:51,636
- You have failed to stop him.
- Then your death will have to suffice.

1104
01:31:10,490 --> 01:31:11,897
Let go of me!

1105
01:31:11,962 --> 01:31:15,737
The book! It's going to fall!
How can we save...

1106
01:31:15,802 --> 01:31:17,875
- Phileas?
- I will save him...

1107
01:31:17,978 --> 01:31:20,499
Wah!

1108
01:31:28,506 --> 01:31:30,131
Mr. Fogg!

1109
01:31:42,490 --> 01:31:44,279
No!

1110
01:31:56,058 --> 01:31:58,065
Oh. Passepartout?

1111
01:32:07,642 --> 01:32:09,944
Passepartout!

1112
01:32:10,010 --> 01:32:11,188
- Huh?
- You're alive!

1113
01:32:12,218 --> 01:32:14,673
Are you injured?

1114
01:32:18,938 --> 01:32:22,451
Yes, well, uh...
Rules are made to be broken.

1115
01:32:22,554 --> 01:32:25,271
Or, uh, stabbed by a spiky shoe.

1116
01:32:25,338 --> 01:32:29,168
Mr. Fogg, you missed the ship.
You'll lose your bet.

1117
01:32:29,274 --> 01:32:32,787
Oh. At least I didn't lose a friend.

1118
01:32:42,586 --> 01:32:45,586
You must be the eleventh Tiger.

1119
01:32:45,978 --> 01:32:47,571
Meow!

1120
01:32:50,458 --> 01:32:55,695
- Let's go. We must catch the next ship.
- It would never reach London in time.

1121
01:32:58,938 --> 01:33:01,305
No. No! No!

1122
01:33:01,402 --> 01:33:05,232
We are not giving up!
I almost died! You almost died!

1123
01:33:05,306 --> 01:33:08,568
We take the next ship
and win that bet!

1124
01:33:11,162 --> 01:33:13,464
Very well.

1125
01:33:13,530 --> 01:33:15,123
- Let's go.
- Yes!

1126
01:33:16,090 --> 01:33:17,683
Thank you.

1127
01:33:51,641 --> 01:33:54,511
Yes. Yes! Yes!

1128
01:33:56,122 --> 01:33:58,097
Oh, it's hopeless.

1129
01:33:58,202 --> 01:34:01,017
By those calculations,
I'm still behind by one day.

1130
01:34:01,082 --> 01:34:05,817
- There must be some way!
- Phileas Fogg on my boat?

1131
01:34:06,649 --> 01:34:09,300
What an honor, sir!

1132
01:34:09,370 --> 01:34:12,982
I've quite a penny wagered on you.
The wife's none too happy about it.

1133
01:34:13,050 --> 01:34:17,687
Then again, she hasn't cracked a smile
since that shark almost devoured me.

1134
01:34:18,330 --> 01:34:20,566
Got 'em both in one bite.

1135
01:34:35,482 --> 01:34:38,100
Ah, it's Inspector Fix!

1136
01:34:38,170 --> 01:34:41,683
My goodness! He made it
around the world before Fogg!

1137
01:34:42,330 --> 01:34:45,625
I came back from India
the short way, you ninny!

1138
01:34:47,225 --> 01:34:50,292
I take it you don't have
Phileas Fogg in that valise.

1139
01:34:54,522 --> 01:34:56,278
A little Jade Buddha, perhaps?

1140
01:35:09,498 --> 01:35:11,986
That's the last
of the coal, Captain.

1141
01:35:21,850 --> 01:35:24,184
Mr. Fogg.

1142
01:35:24,250 --> 01:35:27,152
I'm sorry to say,
we've burnt the last of the coal.

1143
01:35:27,226 --> 01:35:29,779
But I've had a word with the crew,

1144
01:35:29,850 --> 01:35:32,184
and all of them...

1145
01:35:32,826 --> 01:35:34,898
have agreed to burn their shoes.

1146
01:35:36,122 --> 01:35:38,293
The effort is appreciated, Captain.

1147
01:35:38,361 --> 01:35:41,176
Unfortunately,
we've gained a mere six hours.

1148
01:35:41,818 --> 01:35:46,455
- Even shoes cannot help us now.
- Must be something we can do.

1149
01:35:54,777 --> 01:35:58,039
That's it.
I've got it.

1150
01:35:59,258 --> 01:36:00,206
Birds.

1151
01:36:00,281 --> 01:36:02,670
Excellent idea! We'll burn birds!

1152
01:36:02,746 --> 01:36:04,885
No, we'll fly to London.

1153
01:36:04,985 --> 01:36:08,564
We follow the laws of physics
mastered by the birds millennia ago

1154
01:36:08,666 --> 01:36:12,441
and combine it with the Wright
Brothers' steering system.

1155
01:36:13,082 --> 01:36:15,449
Most people would laugh at you.

1156
01:36:15,514 --> 01:36:18,830
But not us. We care about you.

1157
01:36:25,690 --> 01:36:29,039
Captain, I'm afraid
I have to ask permission

1158
01:36:29,114 --> 01:36:31,535
to dismantle your ship
to build this machine.

1159
01:36:31,609 --> 01:36:33,682
Dismantle Carmen?

1160
01:36:33,754 --> 01:36:36,569
But she's me livelihood,
me most loyal companion.

1161
01:36:36,665 --> 01:36:37,843
Never, never, ever!

1162
01:36:37,946 --> 01:36:41,241
What if I could direct you
to an impeccable physician

1163
01:36:41,338 --> 01:36:44,338
who could replace both your nipples,
at my expense,

1164
01:36:44,441 --> 01:36:47,670
and I will give you enough money
to buy a brand-new ship?

1165
01:36:49,082 --> 01:36:51,602
You had me at the nipples.

1166
01:36:51,929 --> 01:36:55,890
- Cornelius, fetch me me tools! Now!
- Aye, aye, Captain!

1167
01:36:57,370 --> 01:36:58,777
One, two! One, two!

1168
01:37:04,698 --> 01:37:06,608
Timber!

1169
01:37:37,018 --> 01:37:39,506
I'll go sharpen the propeller.

1170
01:37:48,794 --> 01:37:50,517
Wrong way. Not looking.

1171
01:38:25,274 --> 01:38:27,216
Just one more.

1172
01:38:27,290 --> 01:38:29,973
That's it! Right, lads, tie it off!

1173
01:38:30,041 --> 01:38:34,384
The Greenwich time zone. The last time
I shall set my watch ahead.

1174
01:38:34,618 --> 01:38:36,723
Well...

1175
01:38:36,794 --> 01:38:39,641
- Shall we fly?
- Let's.

1176
01:38:40,346 --> 01:38:44,372
Mr. Fogg. Hurrah!

1177
01:38:44,474 --> 01:38:46,416
Hurrah!

1178
01:38:47,962 --> 01:38:49,849
Inspiring words.

1179
01:38:50,873 --> 01:38:54,289
- Very well. Prepare for takeoff!
- Yes, sir!

1180
01:39:07,322 --> 01:39:10,421
- Mr. Fogg, are you sure?
- No!

1181
01:39:12,089 --> 01:39:14,194
Whoa!

1182
01:39:20,954 --> 01:39:23,343
How the hell are we getting back?

1183
01:39:23,449 --> 01:39:26,199
Whoa!

1184
01:39:28,857 --> 01:39:31,126
- Now!
- Ohhh!

1185
01:39:37,657 --> 01:39:40,854
You did it, Phileas! We are flying!

1186
01:39:40,889 --> 01:39:43,540
My God! It's...

1187
01:39:44,506 --> 01:39:45,716
magical!

1188
01:39:46,362 --> 01:39:49,493
- Better than your dreams?
- Better than my dreams.

1189
01:39:49,594 --> 01:39:51,350
Hey! Don't forget to steer!

1190
01:40:11,482 --> 01:40:13,849
It's a...

1191
01:40:13,914 --> 01:40:16,019
a telegram from...

1192
01:40:16,090 --> 01:40:18,097
General Fang, sir.

1193
01:40:26,073 --> 01:40:27,961
We're going to make it!

1194
01:40:31,865 --> 01:40:33,970
- This all right?
- Oh, dear.

1195
01:40:34,041 --> 01:40:37,489
- This is exactly like a dream I had.
- You dream of winning the race?

1196
01:40:37,593 --> 01:40:42,230
- No, of crashing to my death.
- Don't worry. I'm gonna get it.

1197
01:40:44,921 --> 01:40:47,191
- Look up there!
- Great Scott!

1198
01:40:47,258 --> 01:40:49,298
Look! A flying machine!

1199
01:40:49,913 --> 01:40:53,296
- Don't step on the wing!
- It's Phileas Fogg!

1200
01:40:54,393 --> 01:40:57,589
Sir, rumor has it a flying machine
is heading for the Royal Academy,

1201
01:40:57,658 --> 01:40:59,763
our bank thief at the pedals.

1202
01:40:59,834 --> 01:41:02,387
Some people will believe anything.

1203
01:41:02,458 --> 01:41:04,879
A flying machine is
heading for the Academy!

1204
01:41:04,953 --> 01:41:08,848
- The bank thief is pedaling!
- See what I mean?

1205
01:41:08,921 --> 01:41:10,776
Help!

1206
01:41:10,841 --> 01:41:13,143
Well done, Passepartout!

1207
01:41:13,593 --> 01:41:15,087
The wing ropes!

1208
01:41:16,314 --> 01:41:20,307
Just a minor setback.
Another minor setback.

1209
01:41:21,273 --> 01:41:24,950
All right, this is a major setback.

1210
01:41:25,433 --> 01:41:27,888
A flying machine is headed
for the Royal Academy,

1211
01:41:27,993 --> 01:41:30,808
and witnesses swear
that it's Phileas Fogg.

1212
01:41:32,345 --> 01:41:35,640
Faster, Passepartout! Faster!

1213
01:41:35,706 --> 01:41:38,259
- We're losing altitude!
- Landing gear?

1214
01:41:38,329 --> 01:41:40,785
That would have been
an excellent idea!

1215
01:41:43,898 --> 01:41:45,905
The bird men are here!

1216
01:41:48,794 --> 01:41:51,696
No. I will not lose this wager!

1217
01:41:51,769 --> 01:41:55,960
He is not to reach the top step.
Get the police. Here. Now!

1218
01:41:56,026 --> 01:41:59,157
I want Fogg arrested the moment
his feet touch British soil!

1219
01:41:59,258 --> 01:42:00,468
Oh!

1220
01:42:00,570 --> 01:42:02,424
- I'm sorry...
- Right in my ear!

1221
01:42:02,490 --> 01:42:05,359
Passepartout, get back in your seat.

1222
01:42:05,466 --> 01:42:08,248
We're going to return to the ground!

1223
01:42:13,689 --> 01:42:15,828
Stop! Kitchner! Hold your ground!

1224
01:42:16,505 --> 01:42:18,927
Why are they fleeing?

1225
01:42:19,001 --> 01:42:21,074
Cowards!

1226
01:42:25,561 --> 01:42:26,968
Hold on!

1227
01:42:56,537 --> 01:42:58,425
Make it to the top step!

1228
01:42:58,489 --> 01:43:01,238
- New Zealand. We didn't go there.
- Top step.

1229
01:43:01,337 --> 01:43:04,337
Arrest them!
They robbed the Bank of England!

1230
01:43:05,050 --> 01:43:08,246
No, no!
Nonsense! Where is your proof?

1231
01:43:08,313 --> 01:43:10,932
This is the Royal Academy of Science!

1232
01:43:11,002 --> 01:43:13,904
We don't need to prove anything!

1233
01:43:13,977 --> 01:43:17,109
Besides which,
by the time you get out of jail,

1234
01:43:17,178 --> 01:43:19,567
you'll have lost the wager.

1235
01:43:24,313 --> 01:43:25,807
Noon.

1236
01:43:25,881 --> 01:43:27,190
We did our best.

1237
01:43:28,633 --> 01:43:32,594
Out of me way! Move it!
I used to be somebody important!

1238
01:43:33,113 --> 01:43:35,317
Should have thrown him
through a higher window.

1239
01:43:35,418 --> 01:43:38,068
- Get off!
- Get rid of this buffoon!

1240
01:43:38,138 --> 01:43:42,545
That's the thanks I get for going
halfway around the world to stop Fogg?

1241
01:43:43,641 --> 01:43:47,700
He also sent a Chinese warlord
to kill Phileas Fogg!

1242
01:43:47,769 --> 01:43:49,395
That's right. He did!

1243
01:43:50,778 --> 01:43:52,949
Lies! All of it!

1244
01:43:56,473 --> 01:43:57,553
- Kitchner!
- Yes?

1245
01:43:58,361 --> 01:44:00,979
- Tell them!
- Oh, well, yes, uh...

1246
01:44:01,049 --> 01:44:04,344
- Well, the thing of it...
- You mumbling moron!

1247
01:44:04,441 --> 01:44:06,710
Salisbury, translate Kitchner's blather.

1248
01:44:06,809 --> 01:44:09,656
I... Me... I... Yes. Yes!

1249
01:44:09,722 --> 01:44:12,656
- Rhodes!
- The thing of it is,

1250
01:44:13,273 --> 01:44:15,160
I don't want to make a fuss.

1251
01:44:15,226 --> 01:44:18,903
You spineless cretins!

1252
01:44:18,970 --> 01:44:23,574
That man stuck me with quills!
Bunches of them!

1253
01:44:23,641 --> 01:44:27,187
Yes! Lord Kelvin's a bully!

1254
01:44:27,289 --> 01:44:32,374
It's true! I hate to admit it,
but I'm a battered lord.

1255
01:44:32,410 --> 01:44:35,410
- No!
- Oh, boo-hoo!

1256
01:44:35,481 --> 01:44:38,580
So what if I did
try to kill Phileas Fogg?

1257
01:44:38,937 --> 01:44:42,133
What are you gutless peons
going to do about it?

1258
01:44:42,201 --> 01:44:45,911
I hold all the power!
I run everything!

1259
01:44:45,977 --> 01:44:51,095
So which of you half-wits
is going to stop me? You? You? You?

1260
01:44:51,161 --> 01:44:54,194
- The queen!
- The queen?

1261
01:44:54,265 --> 01:44:57,015
Oh, the queen!

1262
01:44:57,081 --> 01:45:01,042
That inbred, antiquated old cow!

1263
01:45:01,113 --> 01:45:05,935
The only way she could stop me
is if she sat on me!

1264
01:45:06,905 --> 01:45:10,353
With her big, fat royal bottom!

1265
01:45:13,881 --> 01:45:16,303
She's behind me, isn't she?

1266
01:45:16,953 --> 01:45:19,124
Oh, Your Majesty.

1267
01:45:19,194 --> 01:45:23,384
I have just apprehended the culprits
who robbed the Bank of England.

1268
01:45:23,449 --> 01:45:25,783
- No, Majesty!
- Rubbish!

1269
01:45:27,321 --> 01:45:29,231
Quiet!

1270
01:45:30,521 --> 01:45:32,888
I love being able to do that.

1271
01:45:32,953 --> 01:45:35,506
So, Lord Kelvin,

1272
01:45:35,577 --> 01:45:39,025
unsportsmanlike conduct,
attempted murder,

1273
01:45:39,097 --> 01:45:42,163
trading my arsenal for Buddhas.

1274
01:45:42,265 --> 01:45:44,654
How do you know about that?
I never said...

1275
01:45:44,762 --> 01:45:48,952
Admit it. You've been
a naughty boy, haven't you?

1276
01:45:51,225 --> 01:45:56,179
Your Majesty, I assure you,
there is an explanation for all of this.

1277
01:45:56,249 --> 01:45:58,518
What it was, was, was...

1278
01:45:58,585 --> 01:46:01,585
I was... I... I was simply...

1279
01:46:01,657 --> 01:46:03,250
simply...

1280
01:46:05,017 --> 01:46:06,741
Why do they always run?

1281
01:46:06,809 --> 01:46:08,270
Arrest him.

1282
01:46:08,345 --> 01:46:12,982
Get out of my way, you fools!
Unhand me! Don't you know who I am?

1283
01:46:13,881 --> 01:46:17,361
I'll kill you!
I'll have you for this, Fogg!

1284
01:46:17,465 --> 01:46:21,971
So, is this Phileas Fogg's
miraculous flying invention?

1285
01:46:22,617 --> 01:46:25,268
Your Majesty, we all invented it.

1286
01:46:25,338 --> 01:46:28,883
I'm very impressed,
and that doesn't happen often.

1287
01:46:28,953 --> 01:46:30,230
Thank you.

1288
01:46:30,297 --> 01:46:33,777
But still, we failed
to help Phileas win his bet.

1289
01:46:35,385 --> 01:46:39,182
- I'm sorry, Phileas.
- Don't be, my chéri.

1290
01:46:39,257 --> 01:46:43,316
I saw the world.
I learnt of new cultures.

1291
01:46:43,385 --> 01:46:45,621
I flew across an ocean.

1292
01:46:45,721 --> 01:46:47,314
I wore women's clothing.

1293
01:46:48,185 --> 01:46:50,356
Oh?

1294
01:46:51,321 --> 01:46:53,655
Made a friend.

1295
01:46:55,033 --> 01:46:57,586
Fell in love.

1296
01:46:57,657 --> 01:47:00,821
- Who cares if I lost a wager?
- I do.

1297
01:47:00,889 --> 01:47:06,519
- I've got 20 quid riding on you.
- Your Majesty, it has gone 12 noon.

1298
01:47:06,585 --> 01:47:10,000
Correct. Which gives you
24 hours remaining.

1299
01:47:10,713 --> 01:47:13,462
- Could we have miscounted?
- No.

1300
01:47:13,529 --> 01:47:17,271
I moved Mr. Fogg's watch ahead one hour
as we passed each time zone.

1301
01:47:18,617 --> 01:47:21,006
The international date line.

1302
01:47:21,113 --> 01:47:23,961
We set our watches forward
at 20 more time zones, so...

1303
01:47:24,057 --> 01:47:26,926
here it's still day 79.

1304
01:47:27,001 --> 01:47:29,554
- So, we've...
- We've won!

1305
01:47:36,377 --> 01:47:37,839
We won, we won...

1306
01:47:37,913 --> 01:47:40,433
Thank God. Ah!

1307
01:47:44,665 --> 01:47:47,600
Your Majesty, I...
I apologize. Do forgive me.

1308
01:47:47,673 --> 01:47:51,601
- I quite forgot myself.
- Go and win your bet, Mr. Fogg.

1309
01:47:51,705 --> 01:47:54,640
I shall need a new minister of science.

1310
01:47:57,017 --> 01:48:00,727
Uh, yes, of course, Your Majesty.

1311
01:48:02,969 --> 01:48:05,238
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

1312
01:48:06,233 --> 01:48:09,648
Go!

1313
01:48:14,585 --> 01:48:16,472
- We won, Phileas! We won!
- Yes!

1314
01:48:16,569 --> 01:48:18,162
We won!

1315
01:48:20,505 --> 01:48:22,447
Oh, well done!

1316
01:48:29,081 --> 01:48:30,291
Go ahead.

1317
01:48:35,129 --> 01:48:36,340
Oh!

1318
01:49:07,705 --> 01:49:10,127
# Everybody

1319
01:49:10,201 --> 01:49:12,754

# Crowds are cheering for Phileas Fogg

1325
01:49:28,089 --> 01:49:32,246

1326

# The world is yours and all mankind

1329
01:49:40,185 --> 01:49:44,178
# Can live together and be as one

1330

1341
