{21454}{21487}She sounded...
{21492}{21530}-. . .terrified.|-Of what?
{21535}{21575}Of him, I think.
{21580}{21609}Did she say that?
{21614}{21656}More or less.
{21678}{21737}I want to go over there.|Let's go and--

{21787}{21888}Honey, we're not going to march over|to our new neighbors and accuse them--
{21893}{22001}-That's not what I'm suggesting.|-Especially since they'll keep us up. . .

{22042}{22086}What if something happened to her?
{22092}{22144}-Nothing will happen.|-I'd never forgive. . . .
{22149}{22213}Honey, people argue.

{22589}{22643}-I've got to work tonight.|-I know.
{22691}{22755}This conference is the first|big preview of my paper.

{24948}{24973}Not home?
{24978}{25009}Guess not.
{25015}{25106}-You are so good at this.|-If I were, I'd have done it weeks ago.

{25268}{25316}Good. I'm good.
{25335}{25369}Are you?
{25407}{25491}Why does everyone|find that so surprising?
{25496}{25562}Because your only daughter|just left for college. . .
{25568}{25619}. . .who you're extremely close with.
{25624}{25656}I'd be tripping.
{25661}{25685}Oh, right.

{26399}{26437}Brought you something.
{26446}{26489}It's Kambucha mushroom tea.
{26494}{26561}It soothes heartache|and promotes psychic wellness.
{26566}{26644}-Floriana suggested it.|-So you discuss me with your psychic?
{26649}{26728}No, and she's not really a psychic.|Just an enlightened spirit.
{26733}{26757}Like me.
{26762}{26829}That's worse.|You're gossiping about me.
{26901}{26944}Notice anything different?
{26949}{27018}Oh, my God. You bought it!
{27049}{27073}Nice.

{34251}{34299}Cooper!
{34444}{34494}Fine. Have it your way.
{35812}{35876}We use different kinds.|Now we're using halothane.
{35885}{35937}Halothane? ls that a sedative?
{35942}{35971}It's a dissociative.
{35976}{36049}It paralyzes motor function,|but leaves her conscious.
{36064}{36120}She can't move,|but knows what's going on.
{36125}{36181}-Hi, Mrs. Spencer.|-Hi, Teddy.
{36211}{36268}-How long does that last?|-Five minutes.

{36521}{36549}-Are you okay?|-I. . . .

{36705}{36760}-Did you call the police?|-No.
{36773}{36830}I'll have the police|check on the house while I'm gone.
{36835}{36872}Oh, great.
{36877}{36966}"Could you check in on my wife?|She's hearing voices. "
{36971}{37011}Wait till that gets around.
{37017}{37097}I'll be in New Haven for the|conference. I want you to feel safe.
{37102}{37134}I do.
{37139}{37203}I'm sure it was just. . .
{37225}{37261}. . .nothing.
{37299}{37355}Did you call about the Feurs?
{37360}{37405}Oh, yeah.
{37439}{37504}Harvey says the guy's harmless.|Wouldn't hurt a flea.
{37509}{37568}Warren. Warren Feur.
{37573}{37616}What about her?
{37652}{37695}I know he told me. . . .

{37973}{38021}. . .so Bob Shine introduces us.
{38057}{38113}You'll love this.|He looks right at me. . .
{38118}{38178}. . .and congratulates me|on Spencer's Theorem.
{38195}{38244}He didn't know your father was dead?
{38257}{38281}He knew.
{38395}{38427}What?
{38437}{38487}You're so sensitive about that.
{38493}{38523}-No, I'm not.|-You are.
{38528}{38578}You always overreact.
{38640}{38693}I'll have to watch that, won't l?
{38918}{38956}Was it Mary?
{38961}{38990}Mrs. Feur.
{38995}{39054}Warren and Mary?
{39090}{39116}Yeah.
{39121}{39158}Mary. That's it.
{39199}{39240}I'm gonna do some work.

{43698}{43767}I'm Claire Spencer, from next door.
{43793}{43817}Nice to meet you.
{43823}{43909}I wanted to stop by and welcome you|to the neighborhood.
{43987}{44074}Thank you, but this really isn't|a good time. I'm running late.
{44094}{44129}Is your wife home?
{44174}{44197}No, she isn't.
{44225}{44274}When will she be back?
{44298}{44326}I have to go.
{44331}{44397}I'm sorry. It was nice to meet you.
{44621}{44644}What's he doing?
{44649}{44675}Eating dinner.
{44680}{44709}Alone.
{44723}{44759}TV dinner.
{44765}{44798}That's bad.
{44837}{44868}That's my shiatsu guy.
{44873}{44967}Listen, call me back if he starts in|on some serial-killer dessert...
{44972}{45015}...like ladyfingers.
{45026}{45076}-You got it.|-Bye.
{45147}{45171}Where did you go?
{46079}{46115}Shit!
{47823}{47870}Jesus, Claire.
{47875}{47921}-What the hell are you doing?|-I was looking--

{48076}{48120}-Tonight?|-Tonight.
{48125}{48196}-We're going to be--|-Fashionably five minutes late.
{48204}{48247}Are you saying he murdered his wife?
{48252}{48302}Is that so ridiculous?|She was terrified. . .
{48307}{48385}. . .and now she doesn't answer|the door, but her car's in the garage.
{48391}{48454}Maybe she was out,|or in bed with the flu.
{48459}{48535}-Or maybe she was abducted by aliens.|-Who are you calling?
{48541}{48621}-Restaurant.|-We're not at the center of the bridge.
{48626}{48675}You can't get service|until the center.
{48680}{48740}I know we're not at the center.
{48777}{48829}There. See?
{48849}{48898}Well, that's a relief.

{49442}{49475}Claire, look at you!
{49480}{49518}You look beautiful.
{49527}{49636}Here was this brilliant conductor|in purple bikini briefs. . .
{49642}{49697}. . .with no bangs. . .
{49733}{49809}. . .cursing his ass off in Finnish.
{49826}{49862}Oh, Claire.
{49895}{49924}I made an honest woman of her.
{49929}{49985}How long have you been in Vermont?
{49991}{50037}Oh, well, Norman grew up here.
{50043}{50161}Remember Beau Flynn, head of cardio|at the hospital? He was just sacked.
{50167}{50221}I just dropped her off at college.
{50226}{50305}He was involved in some stalking|incident. An intern, some girl.
{50310}{50342}We're getting so old!
{50347}{50419}They don't screw around|with that anymore.
{50424}{50529}-When did we last get together?|-New York.
{50534}{50601}-Of course. Right after--|-Right after Michael died.
{50606}{50641}-Michael who?|-Marlov.
{50646}{50687}Claire's first husband.
{50692}{50733}-Oh, the musician.|-Yeah.
{50739}{50785}You know, we all toured together.
{50822}{50864}Have you heard her play?
{50869}{50900}No.
{50967}{51037}I would sit on-stage. . .
{51043}{51118}. . .during Claire's solo. . .
{51123}{51221}. . .and I mean, truly, I had tears|streaming down my face.
{51233}{51276}I mean, she's fabulous.
{51281}{51321}So why did you stop?
{51391}{51455}Well, one night, after a concert. . .
{51460}{51545}. . .I met a dashing, handsome. . .
{51559}{51623}. . .genius scientist. . .
{51628}{51720}. . .and three months later,|I was married.
{51741}{51836}Is that when you guys|moved up to Vermont?
{51842}{51918}No, we were living in Boston. . .
{51923}{51976}. . .when Norman was offered a position.
{51981}{52012}A position.
{52018}{52081}The DuPont Chair in genetics.
{52114}{52196}I see. So now you're teaching|at your father's school here.
{52201}{52242}I actually don't. . .
{52247}{52291}. . .do much teaching anymore.
{52296}{52345}I run a research project.
{52468}{52547}Norman's father had this old stuffy--
{52552}{52621}--stately place on a lake.
{52626}{52693}-Which we're renovating.|-Practically gutted.
{52698}{52733}-No, we didn't.|-Yes, we did.
{52739}{52762}"Gutted. "
{52768}{52880}-Wait till you see it. It's beautiful.|-It is beautiful. You'll see it.
{52894}{52928}It's haunted.
{52943}{52967}No.
{52972}{52998}Is it really?
{53003}{53049}Claire's hearing things.
{53065}{53115}What? What are you hearing?
{53277}{53328}I don't know. I heard. . .
{53333}{53390}. . .voices, whispering. . . .
{53408}{53444}A picture fell.
{53449}{53533}You know, I completely believe|in all that.
{53552}{53576}You do?
{53581}{53605}I do.
{53610}{53667}Wait a minute.|Who do you think it is?
{53706}{53758}I know exactly who it is.
{53793}{53835}It's my old man.
{53843}{53909}He's pissed about us|dicking around with the house.
{58546}{58573}Claire.
{58589}{58618}Jesus. . . .
{58640}{58670}It's all right.
{58701}{58744}Calm down, Claire.
{58749}{58790}It's okay.
{59033}{59066}Whose idea was it?
{59071}{59109}Mine. His.
{59114}{59160}We both thought. . . .
{59187}{59234}I didn't want to come here.
{59241}{59297}-Then why did you?|-He was worried about me.
{59302}{59336}-Your husband?|-Yes.
{59342}{59437}I'm sure he's hoping you'll pack me|full of Prozac or lithium. . .
{59443}{59491}. . .so he can live out his life|in peace.
{59496}{59544}-Do you really think so?|-No.
{59549}{59586}Are you on medication?
{59592}{59656}No. Well, Valium.
{59661}{59693}For sleeping.
{59698}{59732}Having trouble sleeping?
{59737}{59773}Sometimes.
{59778}{59817}When I get anxious.
{59822}{59893}Do you get anxious only at night?
{59928}{59980}No, I only take Valium at night.
{59985}{60021}For sleeping.
{60057}{60099}Why do you get anxious?
{60121}{60151}I don't know.
{60160}{60217}Why do you think|your husband's worried?
{60222}{60265}Because. . . .
{60300}{60333}I don't know.
{60357}{60439}Because ever since Caitlin left--
{60444}{60517}Ever since my daughter left|for school. . .
{60533}{60579}. . .there have been. . . .
{60633}{60667}I've been. . . .
{60672}{60722}Why is this so hard?
{60760}{60802}Here. Have a fireball.
{60886}{60928}Thank you.
{60951}{61011}It's hard because I'm|a complete stranger. . .
{61017}{61086}. . .and you're talking about|incredibly personal things.
{61091}{61200}Besides, most people, when they|come the first time, are wondering. . .
{61218}{61269}. . .if I think they're crazy.
{61285}{61332}Don't worry. I'm required. . .
{61337}{61399}. . .to have three sessions|before I can commit.
{61447}{61485}That was a joke.
{61700}{61759}These are good. They're hot.
{61811}{61852}There's a ghost in my house.
{61954}{62003}I saw her in the water, beside me. . .
{62008}{62037}. . .in the bathtub.
{62050}{62081}What does she look like?
{62141}{62183}She looked like. . .
{62189}{62216}. . .me.
{62295}{62351}Only she had green eyes.
{62373}{62416}Any idea who she is?
{62446}{62523}Maybe. But I'd rather not say|just yet.
{62528}{62557}Fine.
{62745}{62783}What do you think I should do?
{62795}{62820}Try to contact her.
{62834}{62932}Communicate with her somehow.|Find out what she wants.
{62964}{63049}What do you want me to do?|Go buy a Ouija board?
{63194}{63259}Are we hoping the ghost|will have to use the potty?
{63265}{63299}This is where she was.
{63304}{63332}This is where l. . .
{63337}{63361}. . .saw her.
{63367}{63400}That makes sense.
{63405}{63470}-Where did you finally find one?|-Kmart.
{63480}{63580}I think we're supposed to sit|in a protective circle, aren't we?
{63585}{63609}What's that for?
{63644}{63689}-Where did you get it?|-Never mind.
{63705}{63741}You stole her shoe.
{63747}{63828}You have to have something|of the dead woman's.
{63833}{63855}Says who?
{63881}{63911}Is that blood on it?
{63917}{64016}I don't know. Just place your fingers|on the message indicator.
{64025}{64067}Okay.
{64325}{64373}We wish to commune. . .
{64378}{64412}. . .with the spirit--
{64462}{64494}What?
{64504}{64537}"Wish to commune. "
{64557}{64584}-Forget it.|-What?
{64590}{64646}No, this whole thing is insane.
{64651}{64679}I'm sorry.
{64694}{64739}What's her first name?
{64802}{64832}Mary.
{64869}{64894}Feur.
{64935}{64999}Mary Feur, Mary Feur. . . .
{65105}{65157}We wish to communicate. . .
{65173}{65243}. . .with the spirit of Mary Feur.
{65416}{65468}Not much happening.
{66243}{66268}What was that?
{66317}{66352}It's flickering.
{66401}{66429}Yeah.
{66917}{66960}-Did you see that?|-Yeah.
{67789}{67817}Cooper!
{67857}{67881}Listen...
{67894}{67952}. . .about our little séance.
{67965}{68002}Norman doesn't need to know.
{68021}{68077}-I won't tell if you won't.|-It's just that. . .
{68084}{68153}. . .ever since the accident. . .
{68158}{68204}. . .he treats me like I'm this. . .
{68209}{68271}. . .fragile, loopy. . . .
{68292}{68358}Well, I am seeing ghosts|in the bathtub, aren't l?
{68364}{68441}You did wrap your car around a tree|doing, like, 80.
{68470}{68509}He was pretty shaken up.
{68514}{68591}-We all were.|-It was an accident. A year ago.
{68596}{68643}I'm fine.
{68661}{68691}Right?
{68770}{68818}Of course you are.
{68859}{68935}You're just not much of a medium,|however.
{68956}{68996}I'll call you tomorrow.
{69001}{69029}Get some rest.
{69034}{69077}Did you pick up any dudes yet?
{69090}{69128}I have one in the trunk.
{69209}{69239}Bye.
{72812}{72860}What do you want?
{73725}{73759}She's dead.
{73765}{73829}-Who's dead?|-You know damn well who's dead.
{73834}{73858}The Feur thing.
{73864}{73887}Listen to me.
{73892}{73948}He killed her and I'm not crazy.
{73953}{74041}Jody and I had a séance in the|bathroom, and nothing happened. . .
{74046}{74130}. . .but when I went back there|she was there. She was.
{74150}{74180}Wait a minute.
{74185}{74245}You had a séance?
{74314}{74372}-Are you angry with me?|-What?
{74410}{74487}-Maybe you resent how busy I've been.|-No.
{74506}{74606}You know what I've got at stake for|this paper. How important it is to me.
{74611}{74703}I can't help feeling that you're|trying to sabotage me, to hurt me.
{74708}{74753}Norman, this isn't about you.
{74758}{74804}Something is happening to me.
{74809}{74924}And it's not to get even, and it's|not some warped bid for attention.
{74929}{75041}Something is happening in our house,|whether you like it or not.
{75102}{75130}Claire.
{75157}{75189}Claire, stop.
{75194}{75222}You're overreacting.
{75227}{75272}Don't tell me how to react.
{75277}{75342}-Will you keep your voice down?|-I will not!
{75347}{75375}Maybe you're right.
{75380}{75425}Maybe I am losing my mind.
{75430}{75470}But what if I'm not?
{75475}{75514}What if she died. . .
{75519}{75548}. . .some horrible death?
{75553}{75598}Can we please not do this here?
{75605}{75644}Oh, wow.
{75772}{75801}You.
{75808}{75854}You think you're smart, don't you?
{75859}{75898}You think you got away with it.
{75903}{75996}Well, I know you killed her,|you murdering son of a bitch!
{76001}{76024}Who?
{76029}{76065}Don't give me that shit.
{76070}{76114}Your wife.
{76135}{76190}She's very upset. Forgive us, please.
{76195}{76222}Honey.
{76258}{76306}I didn't kill my wife.
{76339}{76376}Are you all right?
{76436}{76473}Come on, honey.
{76535}{76582}Come on. Let's go.
{76603}{76628}I'm sorry.
{76851}{76875}You all right?
{76880}{76908}Oh. Yeah.
{76914}{76950}I'm fine.
{76971}{77013}What happened? Just now?
{77018}{77093}I just saw Norman's face.
{77140}{77215}He was so frightened for me.
{77220}{77251}How's your marriage?
{77290}{77345}Good. Really good.
{77362}{77428}We've had our moments, I guess. . .
{77433}{77509}. . .but he's a wonderful husband|and father.
{77524}{77601}I mean, sure, he can be obsessed|with his work. . .
{77606}{77665}. . .and sometimes it's like. . .
{77718}{77773}. . .that he doesn't see me.
{77778}{77832}Or, you know. . .
{77837}{77877}. . .Iike I'm. . . .
{77918}{77979}That there's something wrong. . .
{78007}{78035}. . .with me.
{78092}{78125}That can't feel good.
{78142}{78178}No.
{78361}{78387}Okay.
{78393}{78466}I see where you're going with this. . .
{78471}{78542}. . .but my marriage is fine. No.
{78547}{78652}I have had some kind of|empty-nest episode. . .
{78657}{78720}. . .where I saw. . .
{78725}{78796}. . .some things that weren't there.
{78834}{78918}Let's deal with that.|I'm willing to deal with that.
{79600}{79681}"Thought you might need this.|Love, Jody. "
{80159}{80201}Mrs. Spencer.
{80233}{80336}I wanted to apologize|for scaring you like I did.
{80341}{80397}When I thought about|how it must have seemed--
{80402}{80467}Please. Let's just. . . .
{80566}{80602}Claire Spencer.
{80607}{80648}Mary Feur.
{80653}{80730}-Would you like a cup of coffee?|-Very much.
{80763}{80792}That day at the fence...
{80797}{80854}. . .you seemed terrified.
{80869}{80926}I don't think I imagined that.
{80932}{80963}No.
{80986}{81032}What were you so afraid of?
{81082}{81189}Have you ever felt so completely|consumed by a feeling for someone. . .
{81195}{81260}. . .that you couldn't breathe?
{81284}{81348}Thought that your time together|was so. . .
{81353}{81446}. . .passionate and consuming that you|felt physical pain when they'd leave?
{81513}{81537}Sure.
{81543}{81589}I couldn't catch my breath. . .
{81599}{81629}. . .and I panicked.
{81647}{81707}I never dreamed anyone would hear me.
{81746}{81791}I tried to leave him.
{81810}{81874}I went to my mother's in Providence. . .
{81885}{81923}. . .but he brought my things up. . .
{81928}{81982}. . .in the middle of the night. . .
{81991}{82032}. . .during the rainstorm.
{82037}{82094}He pleaded with me to come home.
{82105}{82141}You must think I'm pathetic.
{82146}{82185}No.
{82221}{82253}I don't.
{82283}{82389}I'll be quick. I've got to get Sidon|to okay my budget before his trip.
{82394}{82453}What's Templeton's wife's name again?
{82458}{82508}Lois. Phil and Lois Templeton.
{82513}{82598}Don't let her corner you,|she'll chew your ear off.
{82604}{82639}-Evening, Phil.|-Here they are.
{82645}{82675}How do you do? Hi.
{82680}{82755}Hi. Nice to see you again, Lois.
{83979}{84019}White wine, please.
{84154}{84190}How are you holding up?
{84196}{84258}Just fine. It's a lovely party.
{84278}{84340}Norman was telling me the house|is finished.
{84345}{84398}-Almost.|-Wonderful.
{84406}{84466}It's good to see you doing so well.
{84475}{84499}Thank you.
{84504}{84561}Well, I was worried.
{84568}{84665}I don't think I've seen you since|Norman's reception here last year.
{84670}{84711}You were worried?
{84740}{84841}I swear, I've become that nosy old lady|I used to run away from at Amherst.
{84846}{84904}No, I'm just not sure what you mean.
{84934}{84997}You got so upset.
{85025}{85063}Oh, at the party.
{85069}{85120}For the DuPont Chair.
{85125}{85157}You remember?
{85164}{85225}Well, I remember the party, but. . . .
{85281}{85320}Oh, God!
{85365}{85430}I had completely forgotten.
{85440}{85473}I broke your crystal.
{85478}{85508}Oh, my dear.
{85513}{85580}A cheap wine glass from the caterers.
{85593}{85671}But you went completely pale.|You couldn't catch your breath.
{85676}{85747}It was as if you had seen a ghost.
{86840}{86872}"Missing girl. "
{86955}{87030}Madison Elizabeth.
{87082}{87119}M-E.
{87449}{87474}Frank.
{87493}{87549}Madison Elizabeth. . .
{87577}{87602}. . .Frank.
{87661}{87714}M-E-F.
{88608}{88635}Claire?
{88695}{88757}Hey, good morning.
{88848}{88873}Up all night?
{88904}{88927}You okay?
{89101}{89141}Do you remember this?
{89314}{89374}It's the girl that disappeared|last year.
{89429}{89460}Did you know her?
{89474}{89497}No.
{89684}{89734}Claire, I'm afraid to ask.
{89774}{89818}Where's all this going?
{89848}{89873}It's her.
{89919}{89986}The woman I saw in the bathtub.
{89991}{90026}-The ghost?|-Yes, the ghost.
{90031}{90077}I thought it was Mrs. Feur,|but it's not.
{90082}{90120}I'm positive this time.
{90125}{90160}Claire, stop it!
{90180}{90213}Stop it.
{90281}{90356}I know you're going through something|I don't understand.
{90408}{90485}I have tried to be here for you,|but this is enough, Claire.
{90490}{90522}Enough.
{90553}{90611}Do you want to go see somebody|together?
{90618}{90661}I'll call Dr. Drayton.
{90727}{90784}Then what, Claire? What?
{90789}{90839}Tell me what to do.
{90860}{90891}It's her.
{90954}{91013}So let me ask you this. . . .|Mr. McCain?
{91019}{91065}-McCann.|-McCann.
{91101}{91204}Nothing was ever found?|No car, or. . .?
{91209}{91290}Listen....|This girl's a real live wire.
{91296}{91394}She drives around in a souped-up|Mustang convertible.
{91399}{91435}Most people think she's...
{91440}{91536}...off around Mexico or somewhere|with her friends.
{91541}{91621}The police downgraded it to a runaway.
{91671}{91743}Her mother lives out here|in Addison County.
{91783}{91844}-Mrs. Frank?|-Yeah?
{91865}{91913}I'm Claire.
{91948}{92021}I wanted to talk to you about Madison.
{92029}{92080}Just plain coffee.
{92096}{92172}-None of that mocha nonsense.|-Fine.
{92221}{92280}You look a little old for a student.
{92285}{92374}I'm not a student. We met at a party.
{92391}{92452}Well, that sounds about right.
{92465}{92555}I never understood how a girl|that wild got all A's.
{92560}{92609}She liked to read a lot, though.
{92614}{92709}Sometimes she'd lock herself up|in her room for days, just reading.
{92746}{92855}They wanted to put her in a school|for the gifted when she was young.
{92875}{92929}Maddie wouldn't hear about it.
{92951}{93026}I don't know where she got it.|She didn't get it from me.
{93053}{93132}She probably got it|from her father's side of the family.
{93198}{93250}She never really mentioned her father.
{93281}{93321}Yeah, well, she wouldn't.
{93351}{93393}She was 1 2 when he left.
{93398}{93453}Never spoke about him after that.
{93512}{93551}You don't even need the sound.
{93609}{93681}You can pretty much tell|what's happening by the faces.
{93728}{93783}I turn it up sometimes, though.
{93800}{93853}Feels like there's someone here.
{93936}{93971}Why are you here?
{94133}{94161}I don't know.
{94204}{94246}You want to see her room?
{94510}{94550}Full scholarship.
{94565}{94602}Princeton too.
{94631}{94688}She wanted to stay on the East Coast.
{94716}{94769}You must be so proud.
{94874}{94940}These are the last pictures|taken of her.
{94960}{95009}The police used this one.
{95049}{95096}Let me get that. Excuse me.
{97030}{97059}Claire?
{97605}{97632}Claire?
{98019}{98118}-Hello, Dr. Spencer.|-Mrs. Spencer.
{98183}{98218}Forbidden fruit.
{98302}{98353}You got a problem with that?
{99622}{99693}Guess this means you're not|mad at me anymore, huh?
{99704}{99745}I wouldn't go that far.
{100910}{100960}Take it easy, huh?
{101095}{101137}What's got into you?
{101250}{101308}-Ow!|-What's the matter?
{101329}{101360}It's too rough.
{101381}{101407}Since when?
{101541}{101576}This is a brand-new--
{101889}{101982}-Okay, Claire, that's--|-Why don't you shut up, professor?
{102019}{102069}Why don't you just. . .
{102089}{102133}. . .shut up?
{103999}{104064}I think she's starting|to suspect something.
{104079}{104105}Who?
{104178}{104201}Your wife.
{104244}{104265}Stop it!
{104589}{104618}You know.
{104630}{104661}What the hell are you doing?
{104688}{104721}I know.
{104809}{104847}I was there.
{104918}{104970}Just before the accident.
{105003}{105032}I remember now.
{105054}{105079}What?
{105104}{105137}I came to the door.
{105170}{105207}There was whispering.
{105212}{105283}I saw you in the mirror. . .
{105353}{105417}. . .Iying there with her. . .
{105422}{105452}. . .in our house.
{105457}{105502}Claire, listen to me.
{105507}{105544}She was at the DuPont party. . .
{105549}{105608}. . .staring at me. It was her.
{105613}{105653}That's why I couldn't breathe.
{105658}{105713}That's why I dropped the glass.
{105718}{105783}Honey, that was last year.|We were having troubles.
{105797}{105857}So you slept with a fucking student?
{105862}{105927}-That's not what I'm saying.|-Don't touch me.
{105946}{105974}Get away from me.
{106028}{106064}Get out!
{106091}{106128}I said, get out!
{106178}{106201}Fine.
{106240}{106278}Claire, please, please.
{106288}{106333}I gave up everything.
{106338}{106381}Claire, please don't. . . .
{106397}{106468}-My life, my music.|-I never asked you to quit.
{106473}{106528}There was never any other choice!
{106533}{106613}You had to topple perfect daddy.|That meant perfect wife.
{106619}{106670}-Perfect family.|-That's not fair.
{106675}{106717}You were touring with a baby. . .
{106722}{106770}. . .and you were happy to give it up.
{106775}{106850}When you did, you hated me for it,|so you gave it all to her.
{106855}{106887}-Who?|-Caitlin!
{106893}{106917}Leave her out of this.
{106922}{107001}And then some bright|young woman finds me attractive.
{107006}{107051}-Stop it!|-And I slipped!
{107056}{107109}-God help me, I slipped!|-I'm not gonna listen.
{107114}{107225}-Claire, I tried to break it off.|-You should've tried harder.
{107423}{107469}I was in Adamant.
{107497}{107523}In Adamant?
{107528}{107626}You know, that artsy little hippie|village a couple hours away down on 7.
{107631}{107740}I stopped at this café to get coffee,|and I see Norman sitting in the back.
{107746}{107778}But he wasn't alone.
{107811}{107861}It was a young blond woman.
{107879}{107918}I didn't see her face.
{107930}{107974}I didn't think anything of it|at first.
{107979}{108039}And I was walking over to say hello.
{108109}{108189}And they started arguing|in such a way. . .
{108225}{108268}. . .that it stopped me.
{108301}{108386}Then a few days later,|you were in the accident.
{108391}{108474}And I get a bizarre call from Stan|working at the hospital. . .
{108479}{108538}. . .asking me, was I with you that day?
{108544}{108585}If you were upset about anything.
{108590}{108659}He made it sound|like you had deliberately. . .
{108664}{108700}. . .driven your car into a tree.
{108705}{108756}And I thought, "Oh, my God.
{108761}{108830}Claire's found out. "
{108835}{108950}And when I went to the hospital,|I see Norman.
{109026}{109107}And he was so desperate|at the thought. . .
{109173}{109219}. . .of losing you.
{109255}{109318}I couldn't say anything.
{109377}{109415}Please. . .
{109487}{109533}. . .don't hate me, Claire.
{109564}{109602}I don't hate you.
{109722}{109753}Hello, this is Miss Jody.
{109758}{109857}Can 't get to the phone. Leave your|name and I'll call you back.
{109870}{109908}Jody, it's Norman.
{109941}{109991}I'm looking for Claire.|Will you please...
{110025}{110071}...ask her to call home, please?
{110179}{110230}I can't talk to him.
{110288}{110362}Will you call and tell him|I'll be home in the morning?
{110425}{110477}I have to ask him something.
{111025}{111057}Norman?
{111798}{111828}Norman?
{111913}{111950}Norman!
{112022}{112056}Oh, God!
{112109}{112162}-How's his blood pressure?|-1 40/80.
{112168}{112251}-How about his rhythm?|-Rhythm is normal. Normal sinus.
{112256}{112299}-No sign of arrhythmia.|-Good.
{112304}{112364}Pulse/ox is normal.|His pupils were equal.
{112370}{112412}I'd still like to take you down.
{112418}{112451}I'm fine, really.
{112456}{112549}Dr. Powell, I'd recommend|a cardiac workup.
{112559}{112655}-I'll take care of that.|-He needs to sign the release form.
{112660}{112700}Thanks, guys.
{112705}{112795}They can take you for a CAT scan|tomorrow if you start feeling dizzy.
{112800}{112844}I'm not going to the hospital. . .
{112849}{112912}. . .unless they have|a miracle drug for clumsiness.
{112918}{112962}Honey, I'm so sorry.
{112971}{113015}Thank God you came home.
{113021}{113059}-Thank you.|-You're welcome.
{113064}{113123}You know, if that breaker|hadn't popped, he. . . .
{113128}{113157}I know.
{113187}{113219}Yeah, don't worry, Claire.
{113224}{113297}You just keep him quiet tonight, okay?
{113302}{113394}You might want to think twice|about keeping anything electrical. . .
{113399}{113457}-. . .next to the tub.|-Oh, thank you.
{113495}{113546}Goodbye. Call me, okay?
{114327}{114405}I called you last night.|I left a message on Jody's machine.
{114461}{114519}I want you to answer one question.
{114588}{114683}Did you have anything to do|with her disappearance?
{114724}{114747}Yes.
{114859}{114905}I had an affair with her.
{114971}{115026}And when I tried to break it off. . .
{115037}{115094}. . .she became unstable.
{115157}{115213}She came out here to the house.
{115253}{115304}She threatened to kill herself. . .
{115371}{115401}. . .or you.
{115464}{115545}I didn't think she'd|go through with any of it.
{115580}{115613}But then she. . . .
{115657}{115698}She disappeared.
{115789}{115825}It was her, Norman.
{115830}{115865}She tried to kill you.
{115880}{115920}-Claire.|-You said it yourself.
{115925}{115965}She wanted you dead.
{115971}{116045}Are you saying I was attacked|by a ghost?
{116055}{116119}You had an affair with a girl. . .
{116124}{116241}. . .who threatened to kill herself, and|now there's a presence in our house.
{116247}{116327}A young, blond girl.
{116345}{116380}Don't you get it?
{116389}{116432}She did it, Norman.
{116439}{116470}She's dead. . .
{116477}{116546}. . .and now she's trying to hurt you|or both of us.
{116551}{116614}-You don't know that she's dead.|-Of course we do!
{116620}{116679}It's the only thing that makes--
{116745}{116777}Oh, God.
{116811}{116868}It's my fault. I. . . .
{116882}{116917}I opened the door.
{116922}{117008}-Madison. I stole her hair.|-From where?
{117013}{117065}-And it gave her power.|-Claire.
{117090}{117176}Nothing attacked me.|There are no ghosts.
{117193}{117255}It was an accident. I'm fine.
{117265}{117339}It's not your fault.|Are you listening to me?
{117354}{117408}-Yes.|-Claire, say it.
{117413}{117488}Say it:|"lt was an accident.
{117494}{117532}It's not my fault. "
{117570}{117612}Say it, Claire.
{117633}{117691}I need to go lie down.
{117697}{117782}I didn't sleep last night,|and I need to lie down.
{117847}{117901}I want to be alone for a while.
{118394}{118454}Hey, Teddy, it's me.|Right, yeah.
{118459}{118556}What's the name of that friend of|yours? That who-you-gonna-call guy?
{118561}{118641}The guy that does the paranormal|psych stuff?
{118649}{118686}Holodnik.
{118726}{118808}Could you contact him and ask him|to give me a call here?
{118813}{118881}I'd really like to talk to him today.
{120594}{120621}Hello.
{120639}{120676}Yes, this is he.
{120681}{120727}Thanks for calling back.
{120772}{120863}No, sir. That was my father.
{120931}{120991}Yeah, he passed away|a couple of years ago.
{121024}{121065}Yes, he was. Thank you.
{121094}{121156}Look, the reason I'm calling is. . . .
{121161}{121227}I'm a little out of my depth here.
{121232}{121309}Someone who is very close to me. . .
{121314}{121381}. . .believes herself to be|or seems to be. . .
{121386}{121435}. . .in contact with some kind of. . .
{121452}{121512}. . .entity or spirit, and--
{121589}{121649}No, there's no. . .
{121654}{121712}. . .no history of delusional behavior.
{121787}{121896}Well, I guess what I'm asking is,|is it possible that she could be. . .
{121901}{121976}. . .causing these manifestations. . .
{121981}{122100}. . .through some kind of unconscious|or telekinetic--?
{122235}{122289}Is there anything else|that it could be?
{122448}{122506}And this has been documented?
{122585}{122611}Really?
{122680}{122740}I'm sorry,|but could I call you back. . .
{122745}{122791}. . .or have you call me back?
{122799}{122841}Please, yes, that'll be great.
{122853}{122881}Thank you, sir.
{122978}{123001}Claire!
{124521}{124553}You all right, Claire?
{124558}{124585}The braid!
{124655}{124686}Where's the braid?
{124691}{124733}What are you talking about?
{124768}{124817}What are you talking about?|This?
{124822}{124871}Is this what you're talking about?
{124876}{124974}-Where'd you get this?|-I took it from Madison's house.
{125028}{125057}This is hers?
{125069}{125119}This is Madison Frank's hair?
{125629}{125662}What do you think?
{125693}{125747}I really don't know.
{125848}{125879}Norman.
{126009}{126037}Yes. . .
{126082}{126120}. . .I believe you.
{126609}{126638}Hey, Coop.
{127330}{127361}You're playing.
{127429}{127461}She's gone.
{127509}{127537}How do you know?
{127570}{127609}I can feel it.
{127813}{127882}I picked up the book you ordered|at the bookstore.
{128096}{128185}Claire, I don't know how to apologize|to you for what I've done.
{128353}{128406}But if you give me another chance. . .
{128459}{128559}. . .I promise I'll spend the rest of my|life making you glad that you did.
{128885}{128916}Please.
{129365}{129401}Last sail of the year.
{129406}{129446}Beautiful, isn't it?
{129458}{129537}We ought to take a drive|before the leaves all disappear.
{129553}{129636}-Stay at a little bed-and-breakfast.|-Look for antiques.
{129641}{129695}Yeah, we haven't|done that for a while.
{129730}{129768}Adamant.
{129797}{129884}-Adamant?|-An artsy little village down 7.
{129889}{129939}Supposed to be charming.
{129955}{130013}-Do you know it?|-No.
{130057}{130121}Maybe we'll stop there for lunch.
{130595}{130630}What's that for?
{130655}{130683}Nothing.
{134749}{134791}God, oh, God. . . .
{135677}{135732}You don't understand what that is.
{135772}{135804}Don't l, Norman?
{135809}{135881}That's Madison's necklace.
{135965}{136006}You killed her, didn't you?
{136038}{136076}I did not.
{136108}{136146}I didn't kill anyone.
{136201}{136243}Jesus, Claire.
{136248}{136276}Listen to me.
{136312}{136352}When I got here. . .
{136363}{136457}. . .she was already dead. She killed|herself in our house to destroy me.
{136477}{136515}Do you think I'm stupid?
{136525}{136604}She left that for you in the garden,|with a letter.
{136609}{136672}I burned the letter|and threw the box in the lake.
{136708}{136732}A week before. . .
{136754}{136833}. . .she showed up at the DuPont party.
{136899}{136931}I was terrified.
{136947}{137026}She insisted, so I agreed|to meet her here.
{137048}{137077}When I got here. . .
{137082}{137127}. . .she had taken pills.
{137157}{137211}I tried to revive her, but. . .
{137230}{137273}. . .she was gone.
{137289}{137344}There was nothing I could do.
{137382}{137457}So I put her in her car. . .
{137465}{137516}. . .and I drove to the boat ramp. . .
{137522}{137600}. . .and I rolled it out into the lake.
{137620}{137686}I made a terrible mistake.|I know that.
{137700}{137736}But tell me, Claire.
{137741}{137813}What should I have done?|Should I sacrifice everything?
{137818}{137858}Our marriage?
{137880}{137958}My work,|which I spent my whole life on?
{138016}{138058}Tell me, Claire.
{138085}{138162}Tell me, please. Because we can|put this behind us.
{138193}{138219}Our life can go on.
{138224}{138261}It's not too late.
{138343}{138401}What are you asking me to do?
{138452}{138516}I'm asking you to forgive me.
{138859}{138909}That girl must be brought up.
{139650}{139718}Hello. This is Dr. Norman Spencer.
{139731}{139769}I have some information. . .
{139774}{139820}. . .about a missing person.
{139830}{139885}Madison Frank, yes.
{139927}{139994}Could you send an officer|out to the house, please?
{140057}{140104}1 5 Willoughby Lane.
{140109}{140161}It's about a mile from the bridge.
{140197}{140225}Okay.
{140249}{140281}Thank you.
{140625}{140673}I'm gonna go get dressed.
{143704}{143759}Information. What city?
{143941}{143972}Don't!
{144033}{144056}Stop it!
{145549}{145602}I begged you, Claire.
{145633}{145686}I pleaded with you.
{145811}{145859}But you wouldn't let it go.
{145952}{145987}Oh, Claire.
{146055}{146113}I never wanted any of this to happen.
{146162}{146188}All I ever wanted. . .
{146232}{146280}. . .was for you to love me.
{146322}{146359}Be proud of me.
{146402}{146437}To be happy.
{146508}{146557}She was going to go to the dean.
{146575}{146615}She would have ruined us.
{146653}{146718}Did she think I was just|gonna sit there. . .
{146723}{146773}. . .and watch it happen?
{146885}{146943}You have no idea what it was like.
{146951}{146999}Hold her underwater. . .
{147070}{147127}. . .watch her life slip away.
{147298}{147348}But she gave me no choice.
{147603}{147639}And neither have you.
{147786}{147864}I can't figure out|how you put it all together.
{147883}{147932}At first I thought you knew.
{147938}{148044}Thought you created the whole|ghost thing as an elaborate trap.
{148068}{148123}Then I realized you believed it.
{148136}{148214}It was a passive-aggressive|masterpiece.
{148318}{148364}The first time I met you. . .
{148383}{148471}. . .all I ever wanted was to spend|the rest of my life with you.
{148525}{148576}It's not gonna happen now.
{149413}{149437}Too cold.
{149487}{149554}I almost froze to death laying here. . .
{149559}{149646}. . .wet, naked, pretending to be|electrocuted.
{149666}{149701}Hey, Coop.
{149709}{149769}How you doing? How you doing, boy?
{149774}{149832}Let's go get your ball. Come on.

{150593}{150626}Could you do me a favor?
{150631}{150712}I'm sleeping at the lab. Could|you check on her in the morning?
{150727}{150765}I'm worried about her.
{150809}{150845}Thanks.
{151421}{151478}The halothane's starting to wear off.
{151616}{151661}I'm sure in some. . .
{151682}{151754}. . .tragic way,|your suicide is gonna. . .
{151772}{151846}. . .help bring Caitlin and I|closer together.
{151919}{151966}And every time I look at her. . .
