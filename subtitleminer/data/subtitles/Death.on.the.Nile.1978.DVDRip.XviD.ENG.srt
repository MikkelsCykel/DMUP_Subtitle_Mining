1
00:00:54,468 --> 00:00:59,030
Death on the Nile

2
00:02:46,246 --> 00:02:47,270
See.

3
00:02:48,281 --> 00:02:50,340
It's her. It's Miss Ridgeway.

4
00:02:50,584 --> 00:02:51,676
That elegant.

5
00:02:51,852 --> 00:02:54,150
Some have to work to live.

6
00:03:10,804 --> 00:03:12,431
Daisy!

7
00:03:12,606 --> 00:03:14,540
In its place.

8
00:03:44,704 --> 00:03:47,229
Welcome to Wode Hall
Mlle. Ridgeway.

9
00:03:47,407 --> 00:03:48,897
We hope you live happily here.

10
00:03:49,409 --> 00:03:51,536
Thank you, Barnstaple.
So be it.

11
00:03:52,312 --> 00:03:55,042
I would like to know the staff,
Mlle.?

12
00:03:55,615 --> 00:03:56,741
Later.

13
00:03:56,917 --> 00:03:59,351
Want to know how they works.

14
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,350
The architect has not yet arrived.

15
00:04:02,923 --> 00:04:04,185
Now, Barnstaple.

16
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:07,324
All right, miss.

17
00:04:13,934 --> 00:04:14,958
Jackie.

18
00:04:15,135 --> 00:04:16,193
Linnet.

19
00:04:16,636 --> 00:04:18,103
- Linnie.
- Jackie.

20
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,268
Sorry,

21
00:04:21,441 --> 00:04:24,410
- The butler did not tell me
- Do not worry.

22
00:04:24,578 --> 00:04:27,741
- You are fabulous.
- You also, as always.

23
00:04:27,914 --> 00:04:29,541
Where I serve the tea, Miss?

24
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:31,880
- In the room.
- Right.

25
00:04:32,185 --> 00:04:33,709
Let's refresh.

26
00:04:33,887 --> 00:04:37,584
- What about Louise?
- Emotional loneliness.

27
00:04:37,891 --> 00:04:41,327
I wanted to get married
with none other than an Egyptian.

28
00:04:41,494 --> 00:04:44,725
He knew nothing of it.
Mandel investigate it.

29
00:04:44,898 --> 00:04:46,957
- E?
- I was already married.

30
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,530
- So you stop him?
- You doubt?

31
00:04:49,703 --> 00:04:53,730
I denied the dowry
and thus he did not want more.

32
00:04:53,907 --> 00:04:54,874
Men!

33
00:04:56,109 --> 00:04:57,576
Linnet!

34
00:04:59,813 --> 00:05:02,213
- It's beautiful!
- I'm glad you like it.

35
00:05:02,382 --> 00:05:05,317
I want to tell you
something and ask you a favor.

36
00:05:05,752 --> 00:05:08,312
- Whatever you want, you know.
- It's serious.

37
00:05:08,488 --> 00:05:09,785
I'm committed.

38
00:05:09,956 --> 00:05:11,287
Jackie,

39
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:12,720
is wonderful!

40
00:05:12,892 --> 00:05:14,689
- You will provide employment?
- Employment?

41
00:05:14,861 --> 00:05:16,488
Here at Wode Hall, please.

42
00:05:17,297 --> 00:05:20,391
Should tell me something
about it first.

43
00:05:20,567 --> 00:05:24,799
Well, his name is Simon,
Simon Doyle and he is ...

44
00:05:24,971 --> 00:05:27,565
He is everything I dreamed.

45
00:05:28,675 --> 00:05:30,609
Jackie.

46
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:32,707
- Is not it beautiful?
- Yes, it's beautiful.

47
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:35,006
- Really.
- But he's broke.

48
00:05:35,382 --> 00:05:37,316
With it we are already two.

49
00:05:37,484 --> 00:05:39,111
These shoes are killing me.

50
00:05:39,285 --> 00:05:42,982
He loves the countryside.
A job here would be ideal.

51
00:05:43,156 --> 00:05:45,317
Linnet, hill
if I marry him.

52
00:05:45,492 --> 00:05:47,619
It's serious, I die.

53
00:05:47,794 --> 00:05:50,024
- You are very passionate.
- I know.

54
00:05:50,196 --> 00:05:52,289
Well, whatever I do?

55
00:05:52,465 --> 00:05:56,162
You have a huge farm.
Someone will have to manage it.

56
00:05:56,703 --> 00:05:59,103
- Simon.
- It takes experience.

57
00:05:59,272 --> 00:06:02,708
Studied Asset Management
in Cambridge. It's brilliant.

58
00:06:02,876 --> 00:06:05,208
If you do not like it,
can fire him.

59
00:06:05,412 --> 00:06:07,642
But I know I'll like it.

60
00:06:07,814 --> 00:06:10,749
Okay.
Why not bring it here tomorrow?

61
00:06:10,917 --> 00:06:12,817
- To speak with him.
- Thanks.

62
00:06:14,087 --> 00:06:15,486
- Jackie.
- Bye.

63
00:06:21,294 --> 00:06:22,625
Do not want to sound silly.

64
00:06:22,796 --> 00:06:25,856
Do not worry;
the Linnet promised.

65
00:06:26,032 --> 00:06:27,431
Well, almost.

66
00:06:28,034 --> 00:06:30,161
Maybe not like me.

67
00:06:30,336 --> 00:06:32,201
Nonsense. Gonna love it!

68
00:06:32,939 --> 00:06:35,567
And you are perfect for the job.

69
00:06:36,142 --> 00:06:38,007
I will do everything not to disappoint you.

70
00:06:38,511 --> 00:06:40,979
Simon, I love you.

71
00:06:41,147 --> 00:06:42,842
It makes me so happy!

72
00:06:44,517 --> 00:06:46,348
The honeymoon will be in Egypt.

73
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:48,009
You always talk of Egypt.

74
00:07:09,576 --> 00:07:10,702
Hi,

75
00:07:11,344 --> 00:07:12,174
Linnet.

76
00:07:12,545 --> 00:07:14,172
Linnie, here it is.

77
00:07:14,547 --> 00:07:16,811
- Come on.
- One moment, dear.

78
00:07:16,983 --> 00:07:17,813
Here you are.

79
00:07:19,853 --> 00:07:20,649
My Simon.

80
00:07:24,357 --> 00:07:25,619
Hello

81
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,125
Jackie has spoken highly of you.

82
00:07:28,862 --> 00:07:31,831
Not perfect? It is not adorable?

83
00:07:34,467 --> 00:07:36,332
Yes, I think will do very well.

84
00:07:42,876 --> 00:07:44,070
I told you.

85
00:07:56,890 --> 00:08:00,826
Linnet Ridgeway''marries
Prince Charming, no fortune.

86
00:08:01,294 --> 00:08:03,956
The honeymoon will be in Egypt.''
My God!

87
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:06,223
Not to say Tutankhamun?

88
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,798
What the hell do we do?

89
00:08:10,937 --> 00:08:14,134
Bremen sails tonight.
I have little time.

90
00:08:14,307 --> 00:08:16,036
Lawyers will find a way in?

91
00:08:16,209 --> 00:08:18,404
- No, silly.
- So what?

92
00:08:20,013 --> 00:08:22,538
I go to Egypt. She'll be there for a month.

93
00:08:24,217 --> 00:08:26,048
I'm Uncle Andrew!

94
00:08:26,219 --> 00:08:28,653
A chance meeting.
I'm traveling.

95
00:08:28,822 --> 00:08:31,655
Lovers on their honeymoon.
She will be distracted.

96
00:08:31,825 --> 00:08:33,349
Got it?

97
00:08:33,526 --> 00:08:36,518
The Linnet is no fool,
Pennington.

98
00:08:38,531 --> 00:08:39,930
Not me!

99
00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:47,235
So make a good trip,
wicked Uncle Andrew.

100
00:08:50,577 --> 00:08:52,442
So this is Miss. Bridgeway.

101
00:08:53,146 --> 00:08:55,376
What do you observe so closely?

102
00:08:55,548 --> 00:08:57,072
His photography?

103
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,444
Or her pearls?

104
00:08:59,052 --> 00:09:02,749
Education, Bowers,
or be unemployed.

105
00:09:03,656 --> 00:09:04,918
And what do I care?

106
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:08,985
This village
is full of wealthy widows

107
00:09:09,162 --> 00:09:11,790
willing to pay
a humble attention.

108
00:09:11,965 --> 00:09:13,489
Come on, fire me.

109
00:09:13,867 --> 00:09:16,529
But that genius, Bowers!

110
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:18,828
You need a vacation.

111
00:09:20,273 --> 00:09:24,573
How about a
short journey down the Nile?

112
00:09:25,078 --> 00:09:27,638
There is nothing that could
I dislike more.

113
00:09:27,814 --> 00:09:30,806
I can not stand two things:
heat and idolatry.

114
00:09:30,984 --> 00:09:32,884
Great, then we will.

115
00:09:35,488 --> 00:09:37,388
Bowers, pack your bags.

116
00:11:12,185 --> 00:11:14,813
They were on a ladder.

117
00:11:14,988 --> 00:11:16,956
- Lazy!
- Lazy?

118
00:11:17,123 --> 00:11:19,785
It's better the way that the arrival.

119
00:11:22,228 --> 00:11:23,593
What a sight!

120
00:11:26,132 --> 00:11:27,292
Happy, darling?

121
00:11:27,533 --> 00:11:28,329
Bobo,

122
00:11:28,501 --> 00:11:30,765
are
the happiest in the world.

123
00:11:30,937 --> 00:11:32,666
and the prettiest.

124
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:34,170
And the more fortunate.

125
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,432
and more alone.

126
00:11:35,608 --> 00:11:37,200
Just us and nobody else.

127
00:11:41,814 --> 00:11:45,011
The pyramid-Neter Menkewre
is 62 feet tall.

128
00:11:45,184 --> 00:11:47,948
Each side of the base
measures 108 feet.

129
00:11:48,388 --> 00:11:50,720
- Jackie.
- What are you doing here?

130
00:11:54,527 --> 00:11:56,688
Admiring the scenery as you.

131
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:00,265
You were in Danielli,
Venice and Brindisi.

132
00:12:01,334 --> 00:12:02,631
What a coincidence!

133
00:12:03,236 --> 00:12:04,396
Jackie, why?

134
00:12:04,837 --> 00:12:07,533
You are following us, deliberately.

135
00:12:07,707 --> 00:12:09,174
Is this true?

136
00:12:09,342 --> 00:12:10,331
It is intolerable!

137
00:12:10,843 --> 00:12:12,105
And ordinary.

138
00:12:12,278 --> 00:12:13,905
Very ordinary.

139
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,579
And effective.

140
00:12:15,748 --> 00:12:17,739
Very effective.

141
00:12:19,752 --> 00:12:20,548
Goodbye.

142
00:13:05,298 --> 00:13:08,426
- Where to go, it appears.
- Honey.

143
00:13:08,601 --> 00:13:10,762
Like a kangaroo in heat.

144
00:13:10,937 --> 00:13:12,427
I understand it.

145
00:13:12,605 --> 00:13:13,731
Understand?

146
00:13:14,073 --> 00:13:16,098
I suppose the fault is mine.

147
00:13:16,275 --> 00:13:18,038
I broke off the engagement
and I married you.

148
00:13:18,611 --> 00:13:20,238
She must be devastated.

149
00:13:20,413 --> 00:13:22,381
Delighting in every minute.

150
00:13:22,548 --> 00:13:23,606
No.

151
00:13:24,617 --> 00:13:25,606
Honey.

152
00:13:29,322 --> 00:13:32,723
We are fortunate ...
that Jackie does not spoil it.

153
00:13:35,027 --> 00:13:36,756
Not allow.

154
00:13:36,929 --> 00:13:39,056
It is the perfect honeymoon.

155
00:13:39,232 --> 00:13:40,927
And no one will spoil it.

156
00:13:43,736 --> 00:13:44,760
Te amo.

157
00:13:49,642 --> 00:13:51,337
Let's bet a race.

158
00:15:02,748 --> 00:15:04,443
- Colonel Race.
- Poirot.

159
00:15:04,817 --> 00:15:06,546
Delighted to see you.

160
00:15:06,719 --> 00:15:09,347
- My old friend! What joy!
- Yes.

161
00:15:09,522 --> 00:15:11,046
I did not see you

162
00:15:11,224 --> 00:15:15,456
from that strange case
cleric beheaded.

163
00:15:15,628 --> 00:15:18,290
It was a lucky find
the knife in the chimney.

164
00:15:18,464 --> 00:15:19,624
Luck?

165
00:15:19,832 --> 00:15:22,062
I exercise my gray matter.

166
00:15:22,235 --> 00:15:24,203
The luck I leave to others.

167
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:26,338
Forgot your high
self-esteem.

168
00:15:27,073 --> 00:15:28,973
Can I ask what are you doing here?

169
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:30,573
I'm on vacation.

170
00:15:30,743 --> 00:15:33,337
I'll run the Nile with the steam.

171
00:15:33,512 --> 00:15:35,673
- And you?
- Do the same, strangely.

172
00:15:35,848 --> 00:15:39,147
Or rather, is
following some passenger.

173
00:15:39,318 --> 00:15:41,718
No. I'm just on vacation, my friend.

174
00:15:43,556 --> 00:15:45,114
- Like you.
- Yes.

175
00:15:49,428 --> 00:15:52,158
This place is free?

176
00:15:52,331 --> 00:15:54,765
In this world, buddy,
nothing is free.

177
00:15:54,934 --> 00:15:56,060
What was that?

178
00:15:56,235 --> 00:15:57,361
Forget it. Sit.

179
00:15:57,536 --> 00:15:59,936
Thanks.
Is reading''''Das Capital?

180
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:01,934
I never travel without this book.

181
00:16:03,576 --> 00:16:05,271
Dr. Ludwig Bessner.

182
00:16:05,444 --> 00:16:07,878
Bessner of the Institute in Zurich.

183
00:16:08,047 --> 00:16:09,947
Jim Ferguson, a citizen of the world.

184
00:16:12,485 --> 00:16:15,147
"You're on vacation?
-No.

185
00:16:15,588 --> 00:16:18,614
Observe the decay
the capitalist system.

186
00:16:19,558 --> 00:16:20,786
Really?

187
00:16:22,161 --> 00:16:24,755
There is a good example here.

188
00:16:25,898 --> 00:16:27,695
The young heiress kagumi.

189
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,967
This parasite!

190
00:16:29,568 --> 00:16:31,695
- Do not you approve?
- It gives me disgust.

191
00:16:32,471 --> 00:16:34,268
In any decent society ...

192
00:16:36,809 --> 00:16:38,936
Yes Maybe you're right.

193
00:16:39,111 --> 00:16:41,443
She has too much power.

194
00:16:42,014 --> 00:16:44,346
- Mr.
- Thank you.

195
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,480
Health

196
00:16:54,827 --> 00:16:55,987
Linnet.

197
00:16:56,295 --> 00:16:57,819
- Honey.
- Uncle Andrew.

198
00:16:57,997 --> 00:17:00,932
What a surprise!
Did not know you were here.

199
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,658
Everything was very fast.

200
00:17:02,835 --> 00:17:05,201
I'm on honeymoon.

201
00:17:05,604 --> 00:17:06,901
On honeymoon?

202
00:17:07,606 --> 00:17:10,097
This is the lucky young man?

203
00:17:10,276 --> 00:17:13,575
My curator of the United States,
Andrew Pennington, love.

204
00:17:13,746 --> 00:17:15,611
Simon.
Simon Doyle.

205
00:17:15,815 --> 00:17:17,476
- Very pleased.
- My pleasure.

206
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:20,084
- In the attached?
- Just a moment.

207
00:17:20,252 --> 00:17:23,085
Do not worry.
I will not intrude.

208
00:17:23,255 --> 00:17:25,519
I know the young.

209
00:17:26,025 --> 00:17:27,856
And the target of all eyes.

210
00:17:28,027 --> 00:17:31,554
Even you,
with his modesty English, the notes.

211
00:17:31,731 --> 00:17:34,564
- It is very beautiful
- And have a lot of money.

212
00:17:34,734 --> 00:17:35,894
You know who you are?

213
00:17:36,068 --> 00:17:37,092
- Of course.
- Yes.

214
00:17:37,269 --> 00:17:38,736
Sorry for the intrusion

215
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:41,029
but I made a bet
with my daughter.

216
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,471
You're Hercule Porridge,
the famous French detective?

217
00:17:44,643 --> 00:17:47,874
Almost. I am Hercule Poirot,
the famous Belgian detective.

218
00:17:48,047 --> 00:17:49,844
I told you, Rosalie.

219
00:17:51,016 --> 00:17:53,678
There is only one Mr. Poirot
in the world.

220
00:17:53,853 --> 00:17:55,286
Unmistakable.

221
00:17:55,454 --> 00:17:57,547
As I am too.

222
00:17:58,124 --> 00:18:00,592
My mother is Salome Otterbourne,
author of novels.

223
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,593
Otter ... Salome, of course.

224
00:18:03,763 --> 00:18:04,593
Charming.

225
00:18:04,764 --> 00:18:07,665
Two famous people
in the same place.

226
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,458
Three, I'd say.

227
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:13,001
I was referring to the genius

228
00:18:13,439 --> 00:18:15,202
and not the mere money, sir.

229
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:18,809
Le presento al Colonel Race
mi viejo friend.

230
00:18:18,978 --> 00:18:21,811
Mrs. ..
and his daughter ...

231
00:18:21,981 --> 00:18:23,278
Encantada.

232
00:18:23,682 --> 00:18:26,173
Sit down, please.

233
00:18:29,255 --> 00:18:31,849
You are writing some
new book, lady?

234
00:18:32,024 --> 00:18:33,958
What happens
in Egypt, perhaps?

235
00:18:34,126 --> 00:18:38,426
That deduction brighter,
Mr. Poirot!

236
00:18:38,597 --> 00:18:40,497
I am here to absorb
local color

237
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:44,693
to my great opus
Snow''on the Sphinx.''

238
00:18:45,271 --> 00:18:48,502
Ice cream becomes an enigma
in white-hot love

239
00:18:48,674 --> 00:18:52,405
When an English girl
fresh out of school

240
00:18:52,578 --> 00:18:56,742
plays the heartless heart
a cruel sheik of the desert.

241
00:18:57,016 --> 00:18:58,347
I think Mr. Poirot

242
00:18:58,517 --> 00:19:01,145
is not an avid reader of novels
Romantic, Mom.

243
00:19:01,487 --> 00:19:04,115
Of course it does.
All the French are.

244
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:06,815
Not afraid of a good sex.

245
00:19:06,992 --> 00:19:11,224
Are different from our
main libraries.

246
00:19:11,397 --> 00:19:14,833
Salome Otterbourne vetoed
Speaking the truth

247
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,627
about men and women.

248
00:19:16,802 --> 00:19:18,531
But she moves on.

249
00:19:19,205 --> 00:19:20,536
The truth, yes.

250
00:19:20,706 --> 00:19:23,174
It's so hard to speak the truth

251
00:19:24,109 --> 00:19:25,201
Thank you, sir.

252
00:19:30,449 --> 00:19:33,543
Would you like to dance
a tango with me

253
00:19:33,719 --> 00:19:34,947
Miss?

254
00:19:36,789 --> 00:19:39,053
Exercise after dinner.

255
00:19:43,562 --> 00:19:45,291
Do you dance tango, Colonel?

256
00:19:45,464 --> 00:19:46,795
Little, Mrs. Otterbourne.

257
00:19:46,966 --> 00:19:48,866
I teach dancing right,

258
00:19:49,034 --> 00:19:51,594
as in Spain,
when it was known as''chica''

259
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:54,898
I mean, with a touch
sensual and erotic.

260
00:20:48,894 --> 00:20:51,385
But my, Jackie!
Leave us alone!

261
00:20:55,501 --> 00:20:56,695
Waiter.

262
00:21:16,221 --> 00:21:18,280
Mr Poirot.

263
00:21:18,457 --> 00:21:19,822
Mr Poirot.

264
00:21:43,682 --> 00:21:44,979
What I saw today with the Linnet.

265
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:46,879
How much you paid for
keep me away?

266
00:21:47,052 --> 00:21:50,078
I do not accept payment
nor accept.

267
00:21:50,255 --> 00:21:52,382
What you say
is friendship.

268
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:54,492
What you have to tell me?

269
00:21:55,694 --> 00:21:58,959
I do something ridiculous?
I'm crazy?

270
00:22:00,466 --> 00:22:01,831
Bury the dead.

271
00:22:02,468 --> 00:22:04,231
Not like the Egyptians ...

272
00:22:04,403 --> 00:22:05,927
keeping the body

273
00:22:06,105 --> 00:22:08,699
to ensure the eternity
the soul. No.

274
00:22:08,874 --> 00:22:11,536
And definitely appropriate.
Give back to the past.

275
00:22:11,977 --> 00:22:14,036
Look just ahead.

276
00:22:14,213 --> 00:22:17,114
Remember that time
heals.

277
00:22:18,484 --> 00:22:21,214
If you think I am suffering
is mistaken.

278
00:22:21,387 --> 00:22:23,480
Actually I am
enjoying.

279
00:22:24,123 --> 00:22:27,581
His pleasure
the worst part of all this.

280
00:22:28,794 --> 00:22:30,261
I do not care.

281
00:22:30,429 --> 00:22:33,921
Simon was me and loved me.
After she got e. ..

282
00:22:40,105 --> 00:22:42,733
It's a small thing

283
00:22:42,908 --> 00:22:44,136
but lethal.

284
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:47,904
My father taught me
to have good aim.

285
00:22:50,349 --> 00:22:51,976
Sometimes

286
00:22:52,151 --> 00:22:56,247
want to put this weapon
in her head

287
00:22:56,422 --> 00:22:59,949
and then slowly
pull the trigger.

288
00:23:03,262 --> 00:23:05,822
I hear this noise,
every day.

289
00:23:07,332 --> 00:23:08,162
I know how you feel.

290
00:23:09,334 --> 00:23:12,201
We all feel that sometimes.

291
00:23:12,371 --> 00:23:14,999
But I warn, Miss,

292
00:23:15,174 --> 00:23:18,166
do not let the evil go
in your heart ...

293
00:23:18,343 --> 00:23:20,106
She's going to stay there.

294
00:23:21,447 --> 00:23:24,177
If love can not live there,

295
00:23:24,349 --> 00:23:25,873
wickedness and will replace it.

296
00:23:30,389 --> 00:23:31,947
How sad, miss.

297
00:23:43,669 --> 00:23:45,694
Hello, Mr. P.

298
00:23:45,871 --> 00:23:48,135
- Returning to the hotel?
- Where else?

299
00:23:48,307 --> 00:23:51,140
It is a surprise to Linnet.
Do you think she like?

300
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:53,005
Depends. She smokes?

301
00:23:53,178 --> 00:23:54,372
Only A. Craven

302
00:23:55,514 --> 00:23:56,503
The purpose

303
00:23:56,782 --> 00:23:58,374
already talked to Jackie?

304
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:00,245
Yes, a few minutes.

305
00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:02,944
Good. I hope you
created court.

306
00:24:03,122 --> 00:24:07,058
To her mind
is the eternal vengeance.

307
00:24:07,226 --> 00:24:08,318
Seriously?

308
00:24:08,794 --> 00:24:10,625
Whenever I'm serious,
my friend.

309
00:24:12,998 --> 00:24:14,625
Jackie is stubborn, I know,

310
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,492
and very possessive.

311
00:24:17,102 --> 00:24:19,332
- But surely ...
- I wanted to possess you?

312
00:24:19,705 --> 00:24:20,899
I suppose so.

313
00:24:21,273 --> 00:24:22,604
Yes

314
00:24:22,775 --> 00:24:24,606
She has
an impish genius''''.

315
00:24:24,777 --> 00:24:26,244
Whether the reins.

316
00:24:26,411 --> 00:24:29,608
Yes, and a man
can not afford it, right?

317
00:24:29,782 --> 00:24:31,477
Not at all.

318
00:24:32,684 --> 00:24:34,549
When I met Linnet ...

319
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,153
How will I explain? ...

320
00:24:36,321 --> 00:24:38,118
It was like the moon
after dawn,

321
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:40,019
have not seen.

322
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:42,820
Once you know it,
Jackie disappeared.

323
00:24:42,995 --> 00:24:45,190
Yes some women
has this power.

324
00:24:45,597 --> 00:24:48,031
But how to solve
his current dilemma?

325
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,033
I have an awesome plan
and guaranteed.

326
00:25:03,482 --> 00:25:04,540
Driver

327
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:07,880
to the railway station
Let's go to Alexandria.

328
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:26,800
For the railway station.

329
00:25:26,972 --> 00:25:28,371
As fast as you can.

330
00:25:30,576 --> 00:25:31,907
Quick!

331
00:26:46,251 --> 00:26:47,377
Thanks.

332
00:26:48,887 --> 00:26:49,979
See. There it is.

333
00:27:02,935 --> 00:27:04,562
Welcome, welcome.

334
00:27:05,203 --> 00:27:07,262
Welcome aboard
of Karnak.

335
00:27:08,473 --> 00:27:12,307
My name is Mr. Chowdhury.
I am the supervisor of this boat

336
00:27:12,477 --> 00:27:13,910
and their pleasure and joy

337
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:16,406
My only concern is
and satisfaction.

338
00:27:16,581 --> 00:27:17,275
The purpose

339
00:27:18,283 --> 00:27:20,183
I'm here .... I'm here

340
00:27:21,086 --> 00:27:23,418
Yes, I have here a list

341
00:27:23,588 --> 00:27:25,613
with the names

342
00:27:25,791 --> 00:27:26,758
and cabins.

343
00:27:27,192 --> 00:27:29,820
Let me guess by their faces
who is who,

344
00:27:30,095 --> 00:27:31,460
OK?

345
00:27:32,698 --> 00:27:35,428
You are Mrs. and Miss.
Otterbourne.

346
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,363
- Right?
- Wrong.

347
00:27:37,536 --> 00:27:39,163
I'm Mrs. Van Schuyler

348
00:27:39,638 --> 00:27:42,505
and I go to my cabin
immediately.

349
00:27:42,674 --> 00:27:46,371
The Bowers will be in the cabin
Conversely, the other side.

350
00:27:46,545 --> 00:27:50,242
The hot afternoon sun
do miracles

351
00:27:50,415 --> 00:27:53,043
cheeks with these bitter
and sour it.

352
00:27:53,218 --> 00:27:54,617
Yes, right now, ma'am.

353
00:27:55,721 --> 00:27:58,383
You must be Yes.
Dr. Bessner,

354
00:27:58,724 --> 00:28:01,591
with this elegant
German mustache.

355
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,388
I fear that never
come to be a detective, sir.

356
00:28:04,563 --> 00:28:08,363
The mustache is undoubtedly
elegant, is Belgian.

357
00:28:08,533 --> 00:28:09,966
My name is Poirot

358
00:28:10,135 --> 00:28:11,602
Hercule Poirot.

359
00:28:13,038 --> 00:28:15,165
The famous Mr. Poirot.

360
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:16,637
I bow to you.

361
00:28:16,842 --> 00:28:18,707
I bow.

362
00:28:18,877 --> 00:28:21,402
Look, it would be simpler
we speak the names

363
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:23,343
and you tell us
the cabin.

364
00:28:23,782 --> 00:28:26,273
Simpler? Yes, miss.

365
00:28:26,451 --> 00:28:29,113
Undoubtedly simpler.
Definitely.

366
00:28:29,287 --> 00:28:31,517
Una brilliant lack
complication.

367
00:28:31,957 --> 00:28:35,893
Right now the assistant
take them to their cabins.

368
00:28:36,061 --> 00:28:37,085
Wizard!

369
00:28:40,999 --> 00:28:41,931
Sailed.

370
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,796
I suggest you give

371
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:46,665
a final
look at the city.

372
00:28:47,906 --> 00:28:49,771
Wizard!

373
00:30:11,957 --> 00:30:13,891
We did it.

374
00:30:14,059 --> 00:30:16,027
We got rid of her,
finally.

375
00:30:16,194 --> 00:30:17,593
What to expect?

376
00:30:17,762 --> 00:30:19,889
You're a genius.

377
00:30:20,065 --> 00:30:22,056
Not bad
Simon to the silly.

378
00:31:07,012 --> 00:31:07,944
Fabulous, is not it?

379
00:31:09,714 --> 00:31:11,545
Miss You. Ridgeway,
is not it?

380
00:31:12,651 --> 00:31:15,245
And the lady is Mrs. Van Schuyler.

381
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:17,251
I wondered if
would break the ice.

382
00:31:17,422 --> 00:31:19,447
Rarely speak
with strangers.

383
00:31:19,624 --> 00:31:22,957
And never with strangers
on their honeymoon.

384
00:31:23,128 --> 00:31:24,561
I'm happy to break
his rule.

385
00:31:25,163 --> 00:31:27,757
The rules are
to break.

386
00:31:27,933 --> 00:31:29,560
At least my

387
00:31:29,734 --> 00:31:30,928
for me.

388
00:31:35,073 --> 00:31:36,802
They're beautiful.

389
00:31:37,876 --> 00:31:38,672
Thank you.

390
00:31:39,177 --> 00:31:41,077
And amazing

391
00:31:41,246 --> 00:31:42,713
if we know how
produced.

392
00:31:44,382 --> 00:31:48,216
One grain of sand
is introduced into an oyster,

393
00:31:48,853 --> 00:31:51,014
that eventually becomes

394
00:31:51,189 --> 00:31:53,054
in a pearl of great price

395
00:31:53,225 --> 00:31:56,456
that adorns the neck
a beautiful girl like you.

396
00:31:58,163 --> 00:31:59,596
I never thought that way

397
00:32:00,165 --> 00:32:02,360
It should.

398
00:32:02,534 --> 00:32:04,866
The oyster almost dies.

399
00:32:07,472 --> 00:32:09,940
Let the cabin.
It's time for your massage.

400
00:32:10,108 --> 00:32:11,700
My companion Bowers.

401
00:32:11,876 --> 00:32:14,504
He fought 15 rounds''''
with Jack Dempsey once.

402
00:32:14,679 --> 00:32:17,011
He never
was the same man.

403
00:32:17,182 --> 00:32:18,945
Sorry, Miss. Ridgeway.

404
00:32:19,117 --> 00:32:21,517
Ms. Doyle,
Ms. Simon Doyle.

405
00:32:21,686 --> 00:32:23,813
Will have to forgive
Mlle. Bowers.

406
00:32:23,989 --> 00:32:26,287
She does not know
statuses.

407
00:32:27,192 --> 00:32:29,057
I was dazzled
for its pearls.

408
00:32:29,227 --> 00:32:30,057
Shut up, Bowers.

409
00:32:30,228 --> 00:32:32,628
Would give all his teeth
to possess them.

410
00:32:32,797 --> 00:32:36,324
Just because you feel her anger,
or rather his father,

411
00:32:36,501 --> 00:32:38,833
- Need not be impolite.
- Rancor?

412
00:32:39,004 --> 00:32:41,632
Melhuish Ridgeway
ruined my family.

413
00:32:41,806 --> 00:32:43,865
Well,
should be grateful.

414
00:32:44,042 --> 00:32:47,307
The contrary, it would
the pleasure of working for me.

415
00:32:48,546 --> 00:32:51,174
Could kill her just for that.

416
00:32:54,052 --> 00:32:55,212
Tea, lady?

417
00:32:59,324 --> 00:33:02,589
Salome Otterbourne am
and want to exchange a word.

418
00:33:02,761 --> 00:33:06,162
We've done that
through our attorneys.

419
00:33:06,331 --> 00:33:09,164
It's about that
I came to beg ...

420
00:33:09,334 --> 00:33:13,168
- Petition?
- Crave, if you want to appeal.

421
00:33:13,338 --> 00:33:17,365
We writers are flowering
in our language.

422
00:33:17,876 --> 00:33:19,867
And defamatory
in his writings.

423
00:33:21,146 --> 00:33:23,171
I regret that we have interpreted

424
00:33:23,348 --> 00:33:26,215
''Passion''in the persimmon
this way.

425
00:33:26,384 --> 00:33:30,184
The intention was only to show
the heart of a girl

426
00:33:30,355 --> 00:33:33,290
that beats the sound
of primitive drums.

427
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:37,595
He does not understand that what I wrote
was very flattering?

428
00:33:38,463 --> 00:33:40,226
Frankly,
Mrs. Otterbourne

429
00:33:40,398 --> 00:33:42,389
I do not consider the comparison

430
00:33:42,567 --> 00:33:45,400
with a female baboon
nymphomaniac, a caring

431
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:49,199
and suggest that our lawyers
decide the appropriate compensation

432
00:33:49,374 --> 00:33:51,365
be targeted by
its vulgar stupidity.

433
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:53,307
Good afternoon.

434
00:33:53,478 --> 00:33:54,809
Philistine.

435
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:58,643
I will show
What is reputation.

436
00:34:21,106 --> 00:34:23,233
Sorry to interrupt.

437
00:34:23,408 --> 00:34:24,432
Uncle Andrew.

438
00:34:24,609 --> 00:34:27,635
These are the documents
you need to sign.

439
00:34:27,812 --> 00:34:30,747
The contract
Chrysler Building

440
00:34:30,915 --> 00:34:33,076
Concessions
silver mine

441
00:34:33,351 --> 00:34:35,342
the transfers
Baku Oil

442
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,579
and fusion korn krisps
Chew Chew.

443
00:34:49,033 --> 00:34:52,093
Sign on last page,
down, baby.

444
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:53,999
Uncle Andrew, I have not read them.

445
00:34:54,172 --> 00:34:57,369
It is not necessary.
Everything has been reviewed

446
00:34:57,542 --> 00:35:00,306
and revised twice
for me.

447
00:35:00,478 --> 00:35:02,878
I always read everything
before signing.

448
00:35:03,047 --> 00:35:04,571
My father taught me that.

449
00:35:04,749 --> 00:35:08,185
I told her not to trust
anyone not in the lawyers.

450
00:35:08,353 --> 00:35:10,787
Darling Melhuish.
That sense of humor!

451
00:35:11,389 --> 00:35:14,119
Never read legal documents
in life

452
00:35:14,292 --> 00:35:16,192
and not think about to start now.

453
00:35:17,662 --> 00:35:18,458
Do not tell.

454
00:35:19,497 --> 00:35:22,523
- There is a bit irresponsible.
- Yes, totally

455
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,759
but I die for a Manhattan.
Is this you?

456
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:27,394
Okay ...

457
00:35:27,572 --> 00:35:29,199
to be our honeymoon.

458
00:35:29,374 --> 00:35:30,170
Very good.

459
00:35:34,078 --> 00:35:36,342
Now the next.

460
00:35:36,514 --> 00:35:38,744
I hope not to tease.

461
00:35:38,917 --> 00:35:42,853
I'ma lawyer and I mean
I admire your attitude.

462
00:35:43,021 --> 00:35:44,420
His father was right.

463
00:35:44,589 --> 00:35:46,853
Never sign
a document without reading.

464
00:35:47,025 --> 00:35:48,754
I'm sure you agree.

465
00:35:48,927 --> 00:35:50,622
Of course.

466
00:35:50,795 --> 00:35:52,422
Sure, no hurry.

467
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,192
Excuse me.

468
00:36:02,841 --> 00:36:04,741
Hopefully not offending him.

469
00:36:04,909 --> 00:36:06,342
And if you did, Mr. ...?

470
00:36:06,511 --> 00:36:09,139
- Race. Colonel Race.
- It's that been done, Colonel?

471
00:36:09,314 --> 00:36:12,647
Lawyers are
deal with offenses.

472
00:36:12,817 --> 00:36:15,445
- We came to the bar?
- Thanks. Very nice.

473
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:17,451
And you, Mr. P.?

474
00:36:17,622 --> 00:36:19,453
Ha reason to celebrate.

475
00:36:19,624 --> 00:36:22,149
My plan to leave Jackie
was a success.

476
00:36:22,327 --> 00:36:24,352
Yes

477
00:36:24,529 --> 00:36:27,760
what it seems
Congratulations.

478
00:36:27,932 --> 00:36:29,866
The Colonel and I
we will accompany them

479
00:36:32,637 --> 00:36:34,002
soon.

480
00:36:34,172 --> 00:36:35,264
Honey.

481
00:36:41,646 --> 00:36:44,080
- Madam, I must tell you.
- Then, Louise.

482
00:36:44,249 --> 00:36:46,080
Not now. It's important.

483
00:36:46,251 --> 00:36:47,445
You wait in the bar.

484
00:36:48,386 --> 00:36:51,014
- What?
- I received a telegram.

485
00:36:51,189 --> 00:36:53,680
My boyfriend ordered
his wife back to family

486
00:36:53,858 --> 00:36:55,587
He's waiting for me.

487
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,624
I gotta go.

488
00:36:57,262 --> 00:36:59,196
Give the money they promised me.

489
00:36:59,364 --> 00:37:01,389
I am working for five years.

490
00:37:01,566 --> 00:37:03,261
This is out of question.

491
00:37:04,068 --> 00:37:06,628
You promised me.

492
00:37:06,804 --> 00:37:08,601
He is still married, Louise.

493
00:37:08,773 --> 00:37:10,536
I beg you.

494
00:37:10,708 --> 00:37:12,801
I need that money
as a dowry.

495
00:37:12,977 --> 00:37:14,410
I have worked well.

496
00:37:14,579 --> 00:37:17,412
And continue to do so
as I have.

497
00:37:17,582 --> 00:37:21,074
- Madam, I can not deny it.
- Thank you, Louise.

498
00:37:23,187 --> 00:37:24,381
Camel!

499
00:37:27,926 --> 00:37:31,259
By God!
How does enmity with all ...

500
00:37:31,429 --> 00:37:34,091
Even his own lawyer
tries to trick her.

501
00:37:34,399 --> 00:37:36,333
He is old fox. Have you noticed?

502
00:37:36,501 --> 00:37:39,026
Knew I was not here,
as I said it ...

503
00:37:39,203 --> 00:37:42,764
''Only holiday,
my friend.''

504
00:37:42,941 --> 00:37:44,374
I think I can tell you.

505
00:37:44,542 --> 00:37:47,534
Work for Lawyers
English Mrs. Doyle.

506
00:37:47,712 --> 00:37:50,442
They suspect that Andrew
Pennington, good ...

507
00:37:50,615 --> 00:37:52,981
- Squandered her money?
- Something like that.

508
00:37:53,151 --> 00:37:54,948
According to the will
his father

509
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:57,383
she would manage your money
to marry.

510
00:37:57,555 --> 00:37:59,045
And as recently married ...

511
00:37:59,223 --> 00:38:02,590
He wanted her to sign
a document to save him.

512
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,784
Exactly.

513
00:38:03,962 --> 00:38:07,454
I think this time the frightened,
but what do next?

514
00:38:07,632 --> 00:38:09,725
Not only did he. Anyone.

515
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:16,890
Inside the Great Temple
of Karnak

516
00:40:17,161 --> 00:40:21,097
passed by the pedestals
with numerous sheep,

517
00:40:22,467 --> 00:40:26,267
each with an image
in front of Amenophis.

518
00:40:27,872 --> 00:40:30,102
Yes, they are sheep.

519
00:40:30,274 --> 00:40:34,005
Sheep libidinous,
unstable, jealous.

520
00:40:34,178 --> 00:40:35,440
That they are noble!

521
00:40:35,613 --> 00:40:38,946
With its proud bodies

522
00:40:39,117 --> 00:40:41,142
and shameless
curved horns.

523
00:40:41,319 --> 00:40:42,877
Yes, come on, lady.

524
00:40:47,825 --> 00:40:49,156
Karl Marx said

525
00:40:49,327 --> 00:40:51,522
that religion was
the opium of the people.

526
00:40:51,696 --> 00:40:53,664
To his mother's sex.

527
00:40:54,031 --> 00:40:55,931
There will be better
calms it down a bit?

528
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,727
It can damage
these beasts.

529
00:40:57,902 --> 00:41:00,769
My mother can
be mocked for you

530
00:41:00,938 --> 00:41:02,530
but that is my mother.

531
00:41:02,874 --> 00:41:06,640
Cared for me in a better
times and not leave now ...

532
00:41:08,212 --> 00:41:10,112
- Now what?
- Nothing.

533
00:41:11,349 --> 00:41:12,646
Sorry.

534
00:41:12,817 --> 00:41:16,150
Do not want to be naughty
much less offend it.

535
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,686
Miss,
I'm not as bad as I look.

536
00:41:18,856 --> 00:41:20,847
- No?
- Word of honor.

537
00:41:26,364 --> 00:41:28,457
Would you mind
offending that there?

538
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,595
Linnet Ridgeway
is a parasite.

539
00:41:30,768 --> 00:41:32,497
A parasite on society.

540
00:41:32,937 --> 00:41:36,065
In a sane world, would kill her
as a warning to others.

541
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,037
- The kill?
- That's what he said.

542
00:41:39,343 --> 00:41:41,334
- Mr. Ferguson ...
- Jim.

543
00:41:41,512 --> 00:41:44,538
Jim, you can defame
the dead?

544
00:41:46,217 --> 00:41:47,878
Do not understand the question.

545
00:41:48,953 --> 00:41:50,284
No matter.

546
00:41:50,454 --> 00:41:52,581
Is not that wonderful?

547
00:41:52,757 --> 00:41:54,987
More beyond all understanding.

548
00:41:55,159 --> 00:41:57,559
The artistic temperament,
Mr. Pennington,

549
00:41:57,795 --> 00:42:00,628
What forms
Stranger it takes!

550
00:42:00,798 --> 00:42:03,232
I fear that this does not concern me,
Mr. Poirot.

551
00:42:03,401 --> 00:42:06,199
I limit myself to the world
facts and figures.

552
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:09,339
The ancient Egyptians knew
facts and figures.

553
00:42:09,507 --> 00:42:11,737
The great vizier Ptahotep

554
00:42:11,909 --> 00:42:15,811
for example, was crushed to death
under a thousand pieces of silver

555
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:19,006
by squandering the fortune
his master.

556
00:42:20,718 --> 00:42:22,709
- Do not tell me.
- I say.

557
00:45:40,484 --> 00:45:41,951
My God.

558
00:45:42,119 --> 00:45:43,108
Are you okay?

559
00:45:43,287 --> 00:45:44,481
Linnet, okay?

560
00:45:46,290 --> 00:45:48,417
Come on. Slowly.

561
00:45:48,592 --> 00:45:50,924
Slowly. Stand Up
Okay?

562
00:45:53,697 --> 00:45:54,823
What happened?

563
00:45:54,999 --> 00:45:57,832
That stone must have fallen
or pushed.

564
00:45:59,503 --> 00:46:00,731
To kill me?

565
00:46:00,905 --> 00:46:01,997
Jackie!

566
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:04,497
But she is not here.

567
00:46:30,935 --> 00:46:33,062
By God, lady,
He was in great danger.

568
00:46:33,237 --> 00:46:34,966
Could be
a horrible accident.

569
00:46:35,139 --> 00:46:37,164
This stone was there
4,000 years ago

570
00:46:37,341 --> 00:46:40,640
and fell just
when there were people below? not.

571
00:46:40,811 --> 00:46:43,371
Not exactly 4,000 years ago
Mr. Poirot.

572
00:46:43,547 --> 00:46:45,777
The columns were constructed
in 1788 BC.

573
00:46:45,950 --> 00:46:49,613
We agree but have
a patient to attend.

574
00:46:50,154 --> 00:46:51,644
- What my neglect!
- There, there

575
00:46:51,822 --> 00:46:54,086
- Let's see.
- I'm fine. Really.

576
00:46:54,458 --> 00:46:58,189
You better get back to the boat
and rest awhile.

577
00:46:58,362 --> 00:46:59,886
Okay,

578
00:47:00,064 --> 00:47:01,998
but only about two hours,
Doctor.

579
00:47:02,299 --> 00:47:04,859
Should I visit the Temple
Abu Simbel tonight.

580
00:47:06,070 --> 00:47:08,163
It's extraordinary.

581
00:47:08,339 --> 00:47:12,207
The image of the eastern
is the famous statue of voice.

582
00:47:12,776 --> 00:47:14,141
- Really?
- Yes.

583
00:47:14,311 --> 00:47:16,711
Well, we get the time.
Thank you, Doctor.

584
00:47:17,982 --> 00:47:20,917
In the evening she makes a sound
sad and sorry.

585
00:47:21,085 --> 00:47:23,383
- He scares me.
- It's harmless.

586
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:57,553
My God! They are fantastic!

587
00:47:57,721 --> 00:48:00,246
I find terrifying.

588
00:48:00,424 --> 00:48:01,618
They are not.

589
00:48:11,235 --> 00:48:12,896
Think you'll sing to me?

590
00:48:13,337 --> 00:48:15,532
Why not? You're divine.

591
00:48:44,401 --> 00:48:46,562
Welcome to Temple
Abu Simbel.

592
00:48:47,504 --> 00:48:49,768
The facade is 25 meters
long.

593
00:48:50,174 --> 00:48:52,301
Each of the statues
Ramses ll

594
00:48:52,476 --> 00:48:54,137
is 20 meters tall.

595
00:48:57,181 --> 00:48:58,773
Get away from me!

596
00:48:59,783 --> 00:49:01,045
Go!

597
00:49:01,385 --> 00:49:02,977
Get away from me!

598
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:04,818
Honey,

599
00:49:04,989 --> 00:49:06,786
she can not ruin everything.

600
00:49:40,557 --> 00:49:42,457
Failed to bury
their dead.

601
00:49:42,626 --> 00:49:44,093
Can not get away.

602
00:49:44,261 --> 00:49:46,354
No, can not stay away.

603
00:49:46,530 --> 00:49:50,057
Do not think I would be deceived
by Simon tricks.

604
00:49:51,869 --> 00:49:54,167
I am sorry to see it here
Miss.

605
00:49:55,139 --> 00:49:56,606
Sorry to say this

606
00:49:56,840 --> 00:50:00,071
but is embarking on a
perilous journey, in choppy water

607
00:50:00,244 --> 00:50:03,941
to meet current
of unknown disgrace.

608
00:50:04,448 --> 00:50:06,746
- Why do you say that?
- Why is the truth.

609
00:50:07,351 --> 00:50:10,548
Cut the last links
that bind to safety.

610
00:50:11,555 --> 00:50:14,115
You can still repent
if you really want.

611
00:50:15,759 --> 00:50:18,922
We have to follow our star
where it takes us.

612
00:50:19,697 --> 00:50:21,358
Even for disaster?

613
00:50:22,166 --> 00:50:23,861
Even in hell itself.

614
00:50:33,610 --> 00:50:36,135
- I forgot my purse. Be right back.
- Right.

615
00:50:48,092 --> 00:50:49,184
Well ..

616
00:50:49,993 --> 00:50:52,086
We are alone, my friend.

617
00:50:52,262 --> 00:50:56,426
She had not had the opportunity
to speak with you privately.

618
00:50:57,601 --> 00:50:59,193
About what we have to say?

619
00:50:59,703 --> 00:51:01,534
My reputation,
Mrs. Doyle.

620
00:51:02,206 --> 00:51:05,642
- Directs that institute in Zurich.
- That's right.

621
00:51:05,809 --> 00:51:08,539
And you have said things
nasty about me

622
00:51:08,712 --> 00:51:11,738
influential individuals
and position.

623
00:51:11,915 --> 00:51:13,940
- Said it's a fake.
- Mrs. Doyle.

624
00:51:14,118 --> 00:51:16,382
- A dangerous hypocrite.
- Listen.

625
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:19,418
My friend Myra Seligman
heard very well.

626
00:51:19,590 --> 00:51:21,888
Let it apply
those foul shots.

627
00:51:22,259 --> 00:51:25,751
I prescribed a treatment
Armadillo with urine.

628
00:51:25,929 --> 00:51:29,763
Yes, I had already used it before
with great success.

629
00:51:30,234 --> 00:51:33,226
In the case of Myra, went mad,
Thanks to you.

630
00:51:33,404 --> 00:51:34,496
I will not allow this.

631
00:51:34,671 --> 00:51:36,696
Your comments
about my treatment

632
00:51:36,874 --> 00:51:38,205
can not continue.

633
00:51:38,675 --> 00:51:41,041
Sue me if you dare.

634
00:51:41,278 --> 00:51:43,143
You know that is impossible.

635
00:51:43,313 --> 00:51:45,281
A scandal
on my clinical

636
00:51:45,449 --> 00:51:46,780
mean ruin.

637
00:51:46,984 --> 00:51:48,849
So will your funeral.

638
00:51:50,154 --> 00:51:53,351
Hopefully
not yours.

639
00:51:54,691 --> 00:51:58,092
Want a creamy cocoa
or cognac, perhaps?

640
00:51:58,262 --> 00:52:00,890
The service upstairs
is very slow.

641
00:52:01,064 --> 00:52:02,463
No thanks.

642
00:52:23,587 --> 00:52:24,884
What time is it?

643
00:52:26,723 --> 00:52:29,385
There is a clock.
Use your eyes.

644
00:52:30,027 --> 00:52:33,121
His mother did not teach
we created

645
00:52:33,297 --> 00:52:37,825
There is a big difference
between eccentricity and discourteous?

646
00:52:38,001 --> 00:52:39,332
My mother was a lady.

647
00:52:39,503 --> 00:52:41,562
Quality that you did not inherit.

648
00:52:41,738 --> 00:52:42,830
It's bedtime.

649
00:52:43,006 --> 00:52:44,530
Okay. Where's my shawl?

650
00:52:44,708 --> 00:52:47,040
I have not seen it.

651
00:52:47,211 --> 00:52:49,270
- You are right that was with him?
- Yes.

652
00:52:49,446 --> 00:52:50,936
I do not see it.

653
00:52:51,114 --> 00:52:52,411
Use your eyes.

654
00:52:56,353 --> 00:52:57,820
Mr. Poirot.

655
00:53:00,824 --> 00:53:02,155
I hope that one day

656
00:53:02,326 --> 00:53:04,760
can tell me some
their cases ...

657
00:53:06,630 --> 00:53:09,963
- The juiciest.
- The juicier?

658
00:53:10,133 --> 00:53:12,328
The bloodiest.

659
00:53:13,237 --> 00:53:15,569
Bloody.
As you wish, ma'am.

660
00:53:15,739 --> 00:53:17,832
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

661
00:53:24,781 --> 00:53:26,874
- Sorry.
- No problem.

662
00:53:28,886 --> 00:53:31,582
It seems very sleepy
tonight, Mr Porridge.

663
00:53:31,755 --> 00:53:33,586
Yes, I'm very sleepy.

664
00:53:33,757 --> 00:53:37,488
Sleep consumes me.
I do not know why I can hardly

665
00:53:37,661 --> 00:53:39,561
keep your eyes open.

666
00:53:40,964 --> 00:53:42,488
Me neither.

667
00:53:42,666 --> 00:53:45,294
Could I follow
up to my cabin?

668
00:53:47,504 --> 00:53:49,563
It is here, as you know.

669
00:53:52,976 --> 00:53:57,811
I suppose that young uneducated
come to try to seduce you.

670
00:53:57,981 --> 00:54:01,940
Do not leave without at least
give a semblance of fight.

671
00:54:02,119 --> 00:54:04,314
Persecution
is very important.

672
00:54:04,488 --> 00:54:05,716
Mother!

673
00:54:06,990 --> 00:54:09,254
No, this is better.

674
00:54:09,426 --> 00:54:11,758
It has a dangerous step.
Whenever I stumble.

675
00:54:11,929 --> 00:54:13,294
No. There is a river.

676
00:54:23,373 --> 00:54:25,273
The old Nile is agitated
tonight.

677
00:54:25,442 --> 00:54:28,275
It's true.
There are strong currents.

678
00:54:29,613 --> 00:54:31,046
Already arrived.

679
00:54:31,214 --> 00:54:33,148
No, no. Alas, alas.

680
00:54:33,317 --> 00:54:35,911
- Good evening.
- Good evening, ma'am

681
00:54:59,443 --> 00:55:00,740
Ola

682
00:55:02,746 --> 00:55:06,147
- He got off the boat?
- Yes, it's beautiful in the moonlight.

683
00:55:07,084 --> 00:55:08,745
A night of honeymoon.

684
00:55:09,753 --> 00:55:12,654
If the daughter of cleric
only take water ...

685
00:55:14,591 --> 00:55:16,616
surely end up with gin.

686
00:55:17,694 --> 00:55:18,490
Ace of diamonds.

687
00:55:20,163 --> 00:55:21,289
- Simon.
- What?

688
00:55:21,465 --> 00:55:22,659
- We are waiting.
- Sorry.

689
00:55:27,371 --> 00:55:28,565
It's your turn.

690
00:55:29,573 --> 00:55:31,700
- Dobro.
- What?

691
00:55:32,109 --> 00:55:34,134
It was your man

692
00:55:34,311 --> 00:55:35,938
but it was bad.

693
00:55:38,582 --> 00:55:39,606
I attached?

694
00:55:39,783 --> 00:55:40,772
No thanks.

695
00:55:42,986 --> 00:55:45,420
You can repeat your bet?

696
00:55:45,589 --> 00:55:46,521
Sorry.

697
00:55:46,690 --> 00:55:49,215
If the aunt of the vicar
never touched drink

698
00:55:49,393 --> 00:55:51,725
wait until it knows
champagne.

699
00:55:51,895 --> 00:55:53,260
Just wait.

700
00:55:53,430 --> 00:55:55,523
Sorry, honey,
was not thinking.

701
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:59,998
They swore to be faithful
each other

702
00:56:00,804 --> 00:56:03,602
- Faithful as the stars.
- Sorry but they won.

703
00:56:04,608 --> 00:56:07,008
- I think I'll sleep.
- It's bedtime.

704
00:56:07,911 --> 00:56:08,741
I will do the same.

705
00:56:10,113 --> 00:56:11,740
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

706
00:56:12,616 --> 00:56:14,243
The boogeyman
do not get it!

707
00:56:14,418 --> 00:56:17,319
- Are you coming, Simon?
- Not long. I'll fix it.

708
00:56:18,488 --> 00:56:19,887
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

709
00:56:20,057 --> 00:56:24,153
- It's late. Gonna lay down.
- No, come on, sit down.

710
00:56:24,327 --> 00:56:26,852
Tell me about yourself

711
00:56:27,030 --> 00:56:28,964
Not much to tell,
really.

712
00:56:29,132 --> 00:56:31,100
I am the daughter of Salome
Otterbourne.

713
00:56:31,268 --> 00:56:33,793
If the wife of a God
never touched wine

714
00:56:33,970 --> 00:56:36,131
can bet it will end
with whiskey.

715
00:56:38,442 --> 00:56:40,376
Continue. Was ...

716
00:56:40,544 --> 00:56:44,310
Saying something
about someone's daughter.

717
00:56:44,481 --> 00:56:47,075
Salome Otterbourne,
the author of novels.

718
00:56:47,250 --> 00:56:48,376
Salome?

719
00:56:48,552 --> 00:56:50,884
She had not cut
the head of a man?

720
00:56:51,054 --> 00:56:53,454
This should be with someone
I know.

721
00:56:54,958 --> 00:56:57,017
- Enough.
- Enough of what?

722
00:56:57,194 --> 00:56:58,218
- In the drink.
- Drink.

723
00:56:58,395 --> 00:57:00,386
By chance is your problem?

724
00:57:00,564 --> 00:57:02,293
- I suppose not.
- That's right.

725
00:57:02,466 --> 00:57:04,229
What is it, Simon?
Are you afraid?

726
00:57:04,401 --> 00:57:06,494
- Fear of what?
- Fear ...

727
00:57:06,670 --> 00:57:11,403
that I tell this girl
the story of my life.

728
00:57:11,575 --> 00:57:12,940
Now I must go.

729
00:57:13,110 --> 00:57:14,202
No, wait.

730
00:57:14,377 --> 00:57:15,776
is a very sad story.

731
00:57:15,946 --> 00:57:18,414
Need three handkerchiefs,
if sentimental.

732
00:57:18,582 --> 00:57:20,174
For the love of God, Jackie.

733
00:57:20,350 --> 00:57:22,011
What?

734
00:57:22,185 --> 00:57:25,177
Go to sleep and let
to make a fool of.

735
00:57:25,589 --> 00:57:29,582
Simon said that''
I'm making a fool of.

736
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:31,853
Simon sent me
go to bed.

737
00:57:32,596 --> 00:57:33,585
Sleep.

738
00:57:34,231 --> 00:57:36,529
You're disgusting!

739
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:37,824
Go to sleep.

740
00:57:38,101 --> 00:57:40,160
You can not treat me well.

741
00:57:40,337 --> 00:57:41,395
Hey, Jackie.

742
00:57:42,072 --> 00:57:43,198
I'll kill you first.

743
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:44,536
Jackie.

744
00:57:59,523 --> 00:58:01,354
Fast. Help him

745
00:58:01,525 --> 00:58:03,322
- My God.
- Heavens!

746
00:58:08,231 --> 00:58:09,323
Call Dr. Bessner.

747
00:58:10,033 --> 00:58:11,864
Take it to your cabin.

748
00:58:12,035 --> 00:58:12,899
Reassure her

749
00:58:14,137 --> 00:58:15,331
What did I do?

750
00:58:15,639 --> 00:58:19,700
Miss Bowers
nurse, is not it?

751
00:58:19,876 --> 00:58:20,934
Ask them to take care of it ....

752
00:58:23,346 --> 00:58:24,370
Come on.

753
00:58:26,249 --> 00:58:27,580
Simon ...

754
00:58:27,751 --> 00:58:29,150
not to be alone.

755
00:58:32,355 --> 00:58:34,289
Then call the doctor.

756
00:58:34,457 --> 00:58:35,355
Fast.

757
00:58:51,274 --> 00:58:53,504
Lie

758
00:58:53,677 --> 00:58:55,304
I'll get Miss. Bowers.

759
00:58:58,281 --> 00:58:59,942
- Simon.
- Easy.

760
00:59:00,116 --> 00:59:03,847
The search was Miss Rosalie. Bowers.
It is a nurse and care for you

761
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:18,324
You took too long.

762
00:59:18,501 --> 00:59:21,231
Ms.. Bowers was in bed.
She comes

763
00:59:21,404 --> 00:59:23,338
- The sooner the better.
- How are you?

764
00:59:23,506 --> 00:59:26,339
How could it be
After shooting the ex-boyfriend?

765
00:59:26,509 --> 00:59:28,101
As can be
so heartless?

766
00:59:30,313 --> 00:59:32,873
Easy.
Ms.. Bowers already.

767
00:59:33,049 --> 00:59:34,448
You'll be fine.

768
00:59:35,018 --> 00:59:35,882
Will be well.

769
00:59:36,052 --> 00:59:37,679
This is Doyle.
There was an accident e. ..

770
00:59:37,854 --> 00:59:40,322
Yes, Miss.
Otterbourne told me.

771
00:59:42,626 --> 00:59:45,595
I think an injection
morphine to calm down.

772
00:59:45,762 --> 00:59:50,665
It is effective when Mrs. Van Schuyler
get nervous.

773
00:59:50,834 --> 00:59:54,292
Ferguson, call the doctor
German next door.

774
00:59:54,471 --> 00:59:57,031
- Ask that meets Doyle.
- Yeah, okay.

775
01:00:04,681 --> 01:00:06,808
It is poorly
Take another napkin.

776
01:00:07,584 --> 01:00:08,551
Easy.

777
01:00:13,857 --> 01:00:16,849
The bone is fractured
and there is much blood loss.

778
01:00:17,694 --> 01:00:18,752
Very good.

779
01:00:21,464 --> 01:00:23,557
Help me to take it
to my cabin.

780
01:00:26,303 --> 01:00:27,895
Are you afraid of blood

781
01:00:28,071 --> 01:00:29,436
as a woman?

782
01:00:29,606 --> 01:00:32,268
Mr. Ferguson,
help me raise him.

783
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:39,141
Stay with her tonight

784
01:00:39,316 --> 01:00:40,908
No one knows how he will react.

785
01:00:42,719 --> 01:00:45,244
- Ms. Bowers, she okay?
- Yes.

786
01:00:45,588 --> 01:00:47,556
Applied morphine.

787
01:00:47,724 --> 01:00:48,782
I will not leave alone.

788
01:00:49,025 --> 01:00:50,014
great.

789
01:00:50,193 --> 01:00:52,184
Young girl, come with me.

790
01:00:53,029 --> 01:00:56,760
It will be more useful to have dizzy
who is afraid of blood.

791
01:00:56,933 --> 01:00:58,195
Open my door.

792
01:01:02,472 --> 01:01:04,269
That, slowly, carefully.
Very good.

793
01:01:06,209 --> 01:01:08,006
We're almost there.

794
01:01:21,157 --> 01:01:22,556
Very good.

795
01:01:22,726 --> 01:01:25,889
Get a cold towel
to the head, yes?

796
01:01:26,062 --> 01:01:27,222
Yes, Doctor.

797
01:01:38,842 --> 01:01:40,173
I'll get the gun.

798
01:01:40,343 --> 01:01:42,243
It should not stop there,
is not it?

799
01:01:43,380 --> 01:01:44,369
- Yes.
- Yes.

800
01:01:45,181 --> 01:01:46,375
Jackie ...

801
01:01:46,549 --> 01:01:48,380
It should not be alone.

802
01:01:48,551 --> 01:01:50,348
She is not alone.
Do not worry.

803
01:01:51,388 --> 01:01:54,824
My dear Lord,
everything was my fault.

804
01:01:54,991 --> 01:01:57,619
I treated her badly.

805
01:01:57,794 --> 01:02:00,126
I did not know what I did.
I was drunk.

806
01:02:00,764 --> 01:02:02,459
This is gonna hurt.

807
01:02:06,770 --> 01:02:09,068
Not the best
tell your wife?

808
01:02:10,874 --> 01:02:12,205
Yes

809
01:02:12,375 --> 01:02:13,501
Yes, please.

810
01:02:14,577 --> 01:02:17,273
No, let her sleep.

811
01:02:17,447 --> 01:02:19,244
not to worry
until tomorrow.

812
01:02:21,985 --> 01:02:24,749
The best I can do
is wrapping.

813
01:02:24,921 --> 01:02:26,513
There is no exit wound.

814
01:02:26,689 --> 01:02:29,249
The bullet got stuck inside.

815
01:02:29,426 --> 01:02:31,917
I'll have to wait
until we arrived in Wadi Halfa.

816
01:02:32,829 --> 01:02:34,524
Climb up his sleeve.

817
01:02:34,697 --> 01:02:35,823
Take,

818
01:02:35,999 --> 01:02:37,193
wipe with it.

819
01:02:40,804 --> 01:02:43,238
I will make splints

820
01:02:43,406 --> 01:02:45,533
and I'll put them

821
01:02:45,708 --> 01:02:47,073
while sleeping.

822
01:02:47,243 --> 01:02:48,232
Thank you, Doctor.

823
01:02:50,447 --> 01:02:52,347
Do not worry.

824
01:02:52,515 --> 01:02:54,312
Everything will be alright.

825
01:03:01,424 --> 01:03:02,550
Is not there.

826
01:03:05,361 --> 01:03:06,658
What?

827
01:03:06,830 --> 01:03:08,092
The weapon is not there.

828
01:03:10,934 --> 01:03:12,458
I wonder who took it?

829
01:03:12,836 --> 01:03:15,361
I do not know.
Hope it is not important.

830
01:04:12,529 --> 01:04:17,364
''Sometimes I want for this gun
in her head

831
01:04:17,534 --> 01:04:21,265
and then slowly
pull the trigger.''

832
01:04:21,437 --> 01:04:22,426
What?

833
01:04:23,973 --> 01:04:24,769
Nothing.

834
01:04:28,845 --> 01:04:31,143
I spoke with the Supervisor.
He charged me the case.

835
01:04:31,314 --> 01:04:33,475
We will be responsible
until we reach the port.

836
01:04:33,650 --> 01:04:35,743
- I am at your disposal.
- Thanks.

837
01:04:36,352 --> 01:04:38,217
What can you say about that?

838
01:04:38,388 --> 01:04:41,482
Shot her with a bullet
very small

839
01:04:41,658 --> 01:04:43,785
22 caliber, I think.

840
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:45,825
The revolver was
well near the head.

841
01:04:45,995 --> 01:04:48,429
Here we can see
versengen''all''.

842
01:04:49,399 --> 01:04:51,833
What drug? Can not speak English?

843
01:04:52,001 --> 01:04:53,798
I mean the singed.

844
01:04:53,970 --> 01:04:55,767
Yes, the singed.

845
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:58,702
Excuse me.

846
01:05:09,085 --> 01:05:10,177
Well, well

847
01:05:12,422 --> 01:05:14,822
- What follows from all this?
- Huh?

848
01:05:14,991 --> 01:05:17,050
I think it's easy.

849
01:05:17,227 --> 01:05:19,457
Mrs. Doyle was dying ...

850
01:05:19,629 --> 01:05:21,927
wanted to identify the killer

851
01:05:22,098 --> 01:05:24,328
soiled finger
with his own blood

852
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:27,128
and''J''wrote on the wall.
Jacqueline.

853
01:05:28,638 --> 01:05:30,435
What you say is nonsense.

854
01:05:30,607 --> 01:05:32,165
She died instantly

855
01:05:32,342 --> 01:05:35,277
- Really?
- Did not have time to write.

856
01:05:35,445 --> 01:05:36,639
No.

857
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:39,040
It was a joke?

858
01:05:39,215 --> 01:05:42,275
Very small
and not very good taste

859
01:05:42,452 --> 01:05:46,684
But the''J''is on the wall.
We have to explain why.

860
01:05:46,923 --> 01:05:50,450
It seems a gesture
childishly melodramatic.

861
01:05:51,928 --> 01:05:54,123
What was the time of death?

862
01:05:55,598 --> 01:05:58,294
Been dead for at least
six hours

863
01:05:58,468 --> 01:06:00,060
and no more than eight.

864
01:06:00,236 --> 01:06:02,170
ie between midnight
and two in the morning

865
01:06:02,338 --> 01:06:03,771
What is extraordinary.

866
01:06:03,940 --> 01:06:04,770
Why?

867
01:06:04,941 --> 01:06:07,068
Because it means
Miss you. Jacqueline

868
01:06:07,243 --> 01:06:09,336
could not have done it.

869
01:06:09,779 --> 01:06:11,610
You even told me,
sir

870
01:06:11,781 --> 01:06:15,979
Mrs. Doyle left the salon
shortly before 11:45

871
01:06:16,152 --> 01:06:17,380
to go to bed.

872
01:06:17,553 --> 01:06:19,111
From that moment on

873
01:06:19,289 --> 01:06:22,486
Jackie has been with
Mlle. Rosalie and Mr. Doyle

874
01:06:23,092 --> 01:06:25,390
or Mr. Ferguson
and Mlle. Bowers,

875
01:06:25,561 --> 01:06:27,586
that morphine injected into it

876
01:06:27,764 --> 01:06:30,733
and stayed with her in his cabin
all night.

877
01:06:31,801 --> 01:06:34,998
Simon Doyle is eliminated
due to his fractured leg.

878
01:06:35,171 --> 01:06:37,196
I suppose it could not
walking wounded?

879
01:06:37,373 --> 01:06:39,307
Not a step, I guarantee.

880
01:06:39,475 --> 01:06:42,308
Good! Hopefully the process
continue.

881
01:06:42,478 --> 01:06:44,639
I'm afraid not, sir.

882
01:06:44,814 --> 01:06:46,111
Almost everyone in this boat

883
01:06:46,282 --> 01:06:49,376
understand why Miss. Jackie
hated Mrs. Doyle.

884
01:06:49,552 --> 01:06:53,283
It was the person needs
for a''plot''.

885
01:06:53,790 --> 01:06:57,817
At least, sir,
can not suspect me.

886
01:06:57,994 --> 01:06:59,256
Why not?

887
01:06:59,429 --> 01:07:02,728
Had a motive to kill her
second discovered last night.

888
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,831
Then he heard the conversation.

889
01:07:06,002 --> 01:07:07,560
But that was no reason.

890
01:07:07,737 --> 01:07:09,136
I could proceso it.

891
01:07:09,305 --> 01:07:10,465
And risk the ruin?

892
01:07:10,973 --> 01:07:12,463
The murder was cheaper

893
01:07:12,642 --> 01:07:14,633
And safer,
if not discovered.

894
01:07:15,111 --> 01:07:18,239
- I could not do something.
- I do not agree.

895
01:07:18,881 --> 01:07:21,714
At the time of shooting
against Mr. Doyle

896
01:07:21,884 --> 01:07:23,545
you could be on deck

897
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:25,551
perhaps suffering from insomnia.

898
01:07:26,656 --> 01:07:28,988
You may have heard the voices

899
01:07:29,992 --> 01:07:32,153
and looked out the window
Salon ...

900
01:07:32,328 --> 01:07:33,556
have seen what happened.

901
01:07:33,730 --> 01:07:34,594
Go to sleep.

902
01:07:34,764 --> 01:07:36,254
Can not treat me well.

903
01:07:36,432 --> 01:07:37,865
Hey, Jackie.

904
01:07:38,034 --> 01:07:39,695
I'll kill you first.

905
01:07:39,869 --> 01:07:41,029
Jackie.

906
01:07:45,441 --> 01:07:47,602
He could remember the position
the revolver

907
01:07:48,244 --> 01:07:50,712
Then when they called
in his cabin

908
01:07:51,347 --> 01:07:52,974
could grab the gun

909
01:07:53,149 --> 01:07:55,083
while attending Mr. Doyle.

910
01:07:55,752 --> 01:07:58,084
Later,
when all was silent

911
01:07:58,254 --> 01:08:02,691
may have left the cabin,
without knowing that his patient,

912
01:08:02,859 --> 01:08:04,724
gone to the cabin
Mrs. Doyle

913
01:08:05,495 --> 01:08:06,792
and shot her.

914
01:08:08,998 --> 01:08:11,899
No, Doctor,
I can not delete it.

915
01:08:12,068 --> 01:08:14,866
what are you implying
ubermaessig''is''.

916
01:08:18,074 --> 01:08:19,701
An insult, yes.

917
01:08:21,377 --> 01:08:24,073
Do not stay here
to be insulted.

918
01:08:55,745 --> 01:08:57,838
Find anything in glaze?

919
01:08:58,014 --> 01:09:01,245
Do not catch flies
with vinegar.

920
01:09:01,417 --> 01:09:03,715
- What was that?
- An old French proverb,

921
01:09:03,886 --> 01:09:06,446
too long
to explain

922
01:09:07,156 --> 01:09:09,750
Let's prepare
for an investigation

923
01:09:09,926 --> 01:09:11,951
customers who pay.

924
01:09:16,199 --> 01:09:18,258
As time passed,
according to his calculations,

925
01:09:18,434 --> 01:09:20,561
between the time
you and the doctor

926
01:09:20,736 --> 01:09:23,398
Mr. Doyle drew hall

927
01:09:23,573 --> 01:09:26,064
when he returned to
to get the gun?

928
01:09:26,742 --> 01:09:29,609
- About three or four minutes.
- Three or four minutes.

929
01:09:30,246 --> 01:09:33,477
You were near the hall
when he heard shooting.

930
01:09:33,649 --> 01:09:35,776
It is totally possible
you

931
01:09:35,952 --> 01:09:38,147
noticing the position
the revolver.

932
01:09:38,554 --> 01:09:39,987
I agree.
Totally possible.

933
01:09:40,256 --> 01:09:42,884
Also entirely possible
you

934
01:09:43,059 --> 01:09:45,960
hoped that the hall
was empty

935
01:09:46,128 --> 01:09:47,993
caught the revolver

936
01:09:48,164 --> 01:09:50,826
and then said
that he had not found.

937
01:09:58,708 --> 01:10:01,802
And then, before informing
Dr. Bessner of disappearance,

938
01:10:01,978 --> 01:10:04,378
could use it to kill
Mrs. Doyle.

939
01:10:05,281 --> 01:10:07,806
Could have done it,
but did not.

940
01:10:09,185 --> 01:10:10,516
And you, Miss?

941
01:10:10,686 --> 01:10:13,553
Could pick up the gun
before leaving here,

942
01:10:13,723 --> 01:10:17,386
while Mr. Ferguson
Mr. Doyle served.

943
01:10:26,202 --> 01:10:28,602
- I'll call Miss. Bowers.
- Right.

944
01:10:33,342 --> 01:10:36,209
When he was seeking
Mlle. Bowers

945
01:10:36,379 --> 01:10:39,576
could have passed
the cabin of Mrs. Doyle

946
01:10:39,749 --> 01:10:41,182
and shot her.

947
01:10:49,492 --> 01:10:52,859
Would just
one or two minute delay.

948
01:10:53,029 --> 01:10:55,827
Mlle. Bowers, wake up.
Miss Bowers.

949
01:10:57,500 --> 01:10:58,296
What?

950
01:10:58,467 --> 01:11:00,458
Please come.
There was an accident.

951
01:11:00,970 --> 01:11:03,370
Why do we
we would have picked up the gun?

952
01:11:03,539 --> 01:11:05,973
We had no reason
to murder her.

953
01:11:06,142 --> 01:11:08,007
But she was''a parasite

954
01:11:08,177 --> 01:11:10,668
a parasite on the skin
society ...

955
01:11:10,846 --> 01:11:12,973
I deserved that kill.''

956
01:11:13,149 --> 01:11:15,174
- Yes but ...
- Yes, sir, that killed

957
01:11:15,351 --> 01:11:17,182
as an example for others.

958
01:11:17,353 --> 01:11:19,218
Nasty French spy.

959
01:11:19,388 --> 01:11:22,050
Belgian spy, please, sir.

960
01:11:23,492 --> 01:11:25,119
And you, Miss ...

961
01:11:25,294 --> 01:11:28,422
was anxious to avoid
great harm to their mother.

962
01:11:28,598 --> 01:11:30,498
I could not have done it.

963
01:11:30,666 --> 01:11:33,430
You asked a question
ha two days. I will answer.

964
01:11:33,603 --> 01:11:35,468
You are right, Miss ...

965
01:11:35,638 --> 01:11:38,266
one can not defame
the dead.

966
01:11:39,575 --> 01:11:41,099
You're horrible.

967
01:11:41,277 --> 01:11:44,940
Pretends to be kind and respectful
and only wants to deceive us.

968
01:11:46,282 --> 01:11:49,718
I must discover
what is hidden, miss.

969
01:11:49,885 --> 01:11:51,250
The truth.

970
01:11:52,388 --> 01:11:55,619
Then, after applying
morphine in Miss. Jackie

971
01:11:55,791 --> 01:11:57,816
- She did not move for nothing?
- Exactly.

972
01:11:58,227 --> 01:12:01,025
Nervous reaction,
alcohol and morphine together

973
01:12:01,197 --> 01:12:02,562
would have sunk the Titanic.

974
01:12:02,999 --> 01:12:05,263
No way could
she was the killer?

975
01:12:05,935 --> 01:12:08,199
Not in any way
may have been her.

976
01:12:08,904 --> 01:12:09,928
No.

977
01:12:10,406 --> 01:12:13,534
But you could.

978
01:12:13,709 --> 01:12:14,733
I?

979
01:12:14,910 --> 01:12:16,935
Yes, ma'am.

980
01:12:17,113 --> 01:12:20,014
Suppose you were
on deck when shot.

981
01:12:20,182 --> 01:12:21,945
Saw what happened

982
01:12:22,118 --> 01:12:24,712
and knew where
got the gun.

983
01:12:25,121 --> 01:12:27,954
Young lady, come with me.

984
01:12:28,124 --> 01:12:31,582
It will be more useful than this fool

985
01:12:31,761 --> 01:12:33,592
who is afraid of blood.

986
01:12:34,463 --> 01:12:37,261
While Mr. Ferguson
and Mlle. Rosalie

987
01:12:37,433 --> 01:12:39,333
helped Dr. Bessner

988
01:12:39,502 --> 01:12:43,131
may have left his patient
and rose to get the gun.

989
01:12:44,006 --> 01:12:45,166
Had enough time,

990
01:12:45,341 --> 01:12:49,038
before Mr. Ferguson
return to search it.

991
01:13:02,992 --> 01:13:06,325
Then he could have gone
the cabin of Mrs. Doyle

992
01:13:06,495 --> 01:13:07,826
and shot her.

993
01:13:08,564 --> 01:13:10,691
What nonsense.

994
01:13:10,866 --> 01:13:12,800
Why would I kill
Mrs. Doyle?

995
01:13:12,968 --> 01:13:15,334
Because her father
Ridgeway was Melhuish,

996
01:13:15,504 --> 01:13:18,803
whose unscrupulous business
ruined his father

997
01:13:18,974 --> 01:13:21,499
and condemned you
to a life as a maid.

998
01:13:21,677 --> 01:13:22,905
Nonsense.

999
01:13:23,079 --> 01:13:24,410
Where'd you hear that?

1000
01:13:24,580 --> 01:13:26,912
Same lady, girl,
three days ago.

1001
01:13:27,083 --> 01:13:29,847
How dare you hear
a private conversation?

1002
01:13:30,019 --> 01:13:31,748
Some voices were heard
far.

1003
01:13:33,422 --> 01:13:35,117
Is this true?

1004
01:13:37,293 --> 01:13:38,317
Yes it is.

1005
01:13:38,994 --> 01:13:39,892
See?

1006
01:13:40,062 --> 01:13:44,021
Why would kill her for something
that happened years ago?

1007
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:48,603
Why still resents
deep effects.

1008
01:13:48,771 --> 01:13:50,762
No, ma'am,
unfortunately

1009
01:13:50,973 --> 01:13:53,271
I am not convinced
he's talking about.

1010
01:13:53,476 --> 01:13:57,640
Had the means, motive,
the opportunity and more ...

1011
01:13:57,813 --> 01:14:00,111
the willingness to kill.

1012
01:14:00,282 --> 01:14:02,307
Mr. Poirot has ended?

1013
01:14:02,485 --> 01:14:03,417
For now

1014
01:14:03,586 --> 01:14:06,987
but be prepared to answer
more questions if needed.

1015
01:14:07,156 --> 01:14:09,021
I will not.

1016
01:14:09,191 --> 01:14:10,556
Mr Poirot.

1017
01:14:12,561 --> 01:14:15,086
It is true that the Linnet?

1018
01:14:15,631 --> 01:14:17,223
Totally true.

1019
01:14:23,439 --> 01:14:25,031
I did not kill her.

1020
01:14:25,207 --> 01:14:26,834
I know everyone thinks that
but not killed

1021
01:14:27,009 --> 01:14:28,237
Quiet, mademoiselle.

1022
01:14:28,410 --> 01:14:31,038
We know we did not.
We have evidence

1023
01:14:31,213 --> 01:14:33,113
- Evidence.
- Thank God.

1024
01:14:33,549 --> 01:14:36,211
But Simon? okay?

1025
01:14:36,519 --> 01:14:39,818
The doctor seems satisfied
with your state.

1026
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:48,656
It was crazy last night.
It could have killed him.

1027
01:14:48,831 --> 01:14:50,628
Do you think he will forgive me?

1028
01:14:50,833 --> 01:14:52,232
It is very likely.

1029
01:14:52,434 --> 01:14:54,868
I know that men
feel less attracted

1030
01:14:55,037 --> 01:14:57,631
women
who treat them well.

1031
01:14:57,807 --> 01:15:00,867
Mlle. Bowers,
accompany her to her stateroom.

1032
01:15:03,078 --> 01:15:05,638
Later we'll take you
to visit him.

1033
01:15:05,815 --> 01:15:07,407
Thanks

1034
01:15:21,063 --> 01:15:23,031
I think we should
seen it first.

1035
01:15:23,199 --> 01:15:24,791
He should be awake.

1036
01:15:26,902 --> 01:15:28,096
Good idea.

1037
01:15:31,941 --> 01:15:34,535
What else

1038
01:15:34,710 --> 01:15:37,304
confuses me if
is the revolver.

1039
01:15:37,479 --> 01:15:39,310
- The revolver?
- Why disappear?

1040
01:15:39,481 --> 01:15:42,780
I do not understand the importance of this.
In many cases this happens.

1041
01:15:42,952 --> 01:15:46,388
Even when you want
a plot? No.

1042
01:15:46,555 --> 01:15:48,147
Why bother to

1043
01:15:48,324 --> 01:15:50,792
J''''writing on the wall,
with blood,

1044
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:52,757
and then hide
revolve the''J''?

1045
01:15:52,928 --> 01:15:55,488
I understand what it says.
They found something.

1046
01:15:56,732 --> 01:15:58,461
One thing is certain ...

1047
01:15:58,634 --> 01:16:01,228
There was a fish
that killed Mrs. Doyle

1048
01:16:35,304 --> 01:16:38,796
"You okay?
"Yeah, thanks.

1049
01:16:38,974 --> 01:16:40,805
I think I lost consciousness.

1050
01:16:40,976 --> 01:16:43,035
Eat something. Will give you strength.

1051
01:16:43,212 --> 01:16:44,941
Thanks.
I do not want food.

1052
01:16:45,114 --> 01:16:46,638
You do not?

1053
01:16:46,815 --> 01:16:49,875
"So I can ...?
Please. Feel free

1054
01:16:59,995 --> 01:17:01,292
I can not believe it.

1055
01:17:04,133 --> 01:17:05,293
Linnet is dead.

1056
01:17:06,735 --> 01:17:08,566
It is a severe blow.

1057
01:17:10,239 --> 01:17:12,901
I suppose everything indicates
that was Jackie ...

1058
01:17:14,009 --> 01:17:16,204
I know that would not commit
a crime as well.

1059
01:17:16,445 --> 01:17:18,037
Relax.

1060
01:17:18,213 --> 01:17:20,545
We know that there was
Mlle. Jackie.

1061
01:17:20,916 --> 01:17:22,178
Thank God.

1062
01:17:23,118 --> 01:17:25,586
Have you any idea
who may have been?

1063
01:17:26,722 --> 01:17:28,451
Well, either.

1064
01:17:29,658 --> 01:17:31,250
Yesterday she said

1065
01:17:32,761 --> 01:17:35,127
that everybody on this boat
were his enemies.

1066
01:17:35,531 --> 01:17:38,591
We have reason to believe
she was right.

1067
01:17:44,239 --> 01:17:45,263
Lord.

1068
01:17:46,542 --> 01:17:47,531
Sorry.

1069
01:17:48,444 --> 01:17:50,105
I came to see if he was comfortable.

1070
01:17:50,279 --> 01:17:52,474
The comfortable as possible.
Thanks, Louise.

1071
01:17:52,648 --> 01:17:54,172
You've found the body.

1072
01:17:54,350 --> 01:17:56,443
Maybe you can give us
some light.

1073
01:17:57,486 --> 01:17:58,885
How, sir?

1074
01:17:59,054 --> 01:18:03,013
Are you accusing me?
A respectable girl?

1075
01:18:03,192 --> 01:18:06,286
- I swear on my dead mother ...
- Quiet, Louise.

1076
01:18:06,462 --> 01:18:09,989
No stories.
Just tell the truth.

1077
01:18:10,165 --> 01:18:11,291
Sit.

1078
01:18:14,269 --> 01:18:17,102
Lord detective, believe me.

1079
01:18:17,272 --> 01:18:20,935
Everybody loved
poor Mrs. Doyle. Age ..

1080
01:18:21,176 --> 01:18:24,976
He was young, beautiful.
Nobody would want to kill her.

1081
01:18:25,147 --> 01:18:28,116
Louise, this is not true,
including you ...

1082
01:18:28,283 --> 01:18:30,808
They might say something
that everyone understands?

1083
01:18:30,986 --> 01:18:35,320
She said that everyone loved
Mrs. Doyle.

1084
01:18:35,491 --> 01:18:37,482
At least it is something new.

1085
01:18:39,028 --> 01:18:41,019
When was the last time
Mrs. Doyle saw live?

1086
01:18:42,097 --> 01:18:43,257
Yesterday evening, sir.

1087
01:18:43,432 --> 01:18:46,162
I was in her cabin,
helping her to undress

1088
01:18:46,435 --> 01:18:48,027
And then where did it go?

1089
01:18:48,203 --> 01:18:50,194
For my cabin,
where else?

1090
01:18:50,806 --> 01:18:53,400
And not seen or heard anything
that can help us?

1091
01:18:53,609 --> 01:18:54,667
How, sir?

1092
01:18:54,843 --> 01:18:57,038
My cabin
is on the other side of the boat.

1093
01:18:58,013 --> 01:19:01,346
Naturally
it could not sleep

1094
01:19:01,517 --> 01:19:03,678
if it had gone on deck

1095
01:19:03,852 --> 01:19:05,717
might have seen the killer

1096
01:19:06,021 --> 01:19:08,387
enter and leave the cabin
lady.

1097
01:19:09,324 --> 01:19:10,882
But as was ...

1098
01:19:11,326 --> 01:19:13,556
Lord, I beg
who understands my situation

1099
01:19:13,729 --> 01:19:14,753
What more can I say?

1100
01:19:14,930 --> 01:19:17,091
Nobody is
accusing you of anything

1101
01:19:17,266 --> 01:19:19,359
Do not worry, Louise.
I will protect you.

1102
01:19:19,768 --> 01:19:22,362
- You are very good.
- But ...

1103
01:19:24,139 --> 01:19:28,667
if he had not returned direct
to his cabin

1104
01:19:28,844 --> 01:19:30,368
had time

1105
01:19:30,546 --> 01:19:33,310
witnessing aggression
Mr. Doyle in the lounge.

1106
01:19:33,649 --> 01:19:35,674
- No.
- Yes.

1107
01:19:35,851 --> 01:19:39,082
Could have walked
the deck and see everything,

1108
01:19:39,254 --> 01:19:42,087
in due course
take the revolver

1109
01:19:42,658 --> 01:19:43,784
back ...

1110
01:19:48,363 --> 01:19:49,955
and kill Mrs. Doyle.

1111
01:19:50,365 --> 01:19:51,923
Lord, is being
unfair.

1112
01:19:52,101 --> 01:19:54,296
Why would I do something bad?
Answer.

1113
01:19:54,470 --> 01:19:55,562
Louise.

1114
01:19:56,805 --> 01:19:58,295
I know all about you

1115
01:19:58,474 --> 01:20:00,601
and his novel

1116
01:20:00,776 --> 01:20:04,439
and opposition from Mrs. Doyle
when he wanted to go.

1117
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:06,973
But I have no money
or references.

1118
01:20:07,216 --> 01:20:08,808
My only option was to stay

1119
01:20:08,984 --> 01:20:11,077
Precisely.
The hated for it.

1120
01:20:11,286 --> 01:20:12,617
But did not kill her.

1121
01:20:13,589 --> 01:20:15,819
One last question, Louise.

1122
01:20:15,991 --> 01:20:19,085
Where are the pearls
Mrs. Doyle?

1123
01:20:19,795 --> 01:20:21,820
Her pearls?

1124
01:20:21,997 --> 01:20:24,124
She wore them last night.

1125
01:20:24,299 --> 01:20:26,358
She left them at the table,
near the bed.

1126
01:20:26,535 --> 01:20:28,526
They were there in the morning?

1127
01:20:28,904 --> 01:20:31,099
My God! Not even looked.

1128
01:20:32,407 --> 01:20:35,205
I approached the bed,
I saw the lady

1129
01:20:36,044 --> 01:20:38,137
screamed and ran out
the cabin.

1130
01:20:38,914 --> 01:20:40,313
Did not even look!

1131
01:20:41,316 --> 01:20:45,013
But I, Hercule Poirot,
I have eyes that watch everything.

1132
01:20:45,921 --> 01:20:48,947
The beads were not
on the table this morning.

1133
01:20:49,324 --> 01:20:50,757
Had evaporated,

1134
01:20:51,026 --> 01:20:52,516
gone,

1135
01:20:54,129 --> 01:20:55,562
disappeared.

1136
01:21:09,444 --> 01:21:11,776
- We must find the gun.
- And the pearls.

1137
01:21:11,947 --> 01:21:14,677
This should not be
very difficult.

1138
01:21:17,052 --> 01:21:18,076
That heat.

1139
01:21:18,253 --> 01:21:20,380
You're right.
I'll change your shirt.

1140
01:21:20,556 --> 01:21:23,150
Let us pause
to cool down

1141
01:21:24,660 --> 01:21:27,959
and let the gray matter
rest.

1142
01:21:28,163 --> 01:21:29,095
See you in five minutes

1143
01:23:13,669 --> 01:23:17,605
I wish to thank
the very timely help.

1144
01:23:19,074 --> 01:23:21,133
It was a pleasure.
Heard you called SOS.

1145
01:23:21,310 --> 01:23:23,540
- Do you think it was on purpose?
- Of course

1146
01:23:23,712 --> 01:23:27,910
but a simple snake
will not stop an investigation

1147
01:23:28,083 --> 01:23:29,573
Hercule Poirot.

1148
01:23:30,886 --> 01:23:32,547
How is your research?

1149
01:23:32,721 --> 01:23:35,519
With intelligence and discretion?

1150
01:23:35,691 --> 01:23:38,888
- Nobody to put handcuffs?
- Not yet.

1151
01:23:41,930 --> 01:23:46,026
There's a snake
killed there.

1152
01:23:46,201 --> 01:23:48,635
Kindly send
removes it. Thanks.

1153
01:23:48,804 --> 01:23:50,101
Come on Race.

1154
01:23:50,405 --> 01:23:52,930
A snake? Not possible!

1155
01:23:53,108 --> 01:23:57,238
I had never seen a reptile
first in a cabin.

1156
01:23:57,412 --> 01:23:58,606
Ever.

1157
01:24:07,956 --> 01:24:10,254
Who's next? Pennington?
We know how it is.

1158
01:24:10,425 --> 01:24:11,619
It's dangerous.

1159
01:24:34,349 --> 01:24:36,943
Poirot Lord, I guess.

1160
01:24:37,753 --> 01:24:39,311
Excuse me, ma'am.

1161
01:24:43,692 --> 01:24:47,389
Perhaps allow
that we follow?

1162
01:24:47,562 --> 01:24:49,086
Of course.

1163
01:24:51,366 --> 01:24:54,392
- Yes?
- Its cabin is close to Mrs. Doyle?

1164
01:24:54,569 --> 01:24:55,467
That's right.

1165
01:24:55,637 --> 01:24:58,504
He heard something strange
last night?

1166
01:24:58,673 --> 01:25:02,131
Of course it does.
I sleep very lightly

1167
01:25:02,310 --> 01:25:05,143
and something woke me up,
as a click.

1168
01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:06,704
A click?

1169
01:25:06,882 --> 01:25:10,875
Yes, with a champagne cork
when bursts

1170
01:25:11,720 --> 01:25:14,314
A champagne common
is clear and

1171
01:25:14,489 --> 01:25:16,423
is not a good crop.

1172
01:25:16,591 --> 01:25:19,492
They make a noise
much more discreet.

1173
01:25:19,995 --> 01:25:23,431
It could have been
a small weapon and not a cork?

1174
01:25:23,598 --> 01:25:24,530
Quite possibly.

1175
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:26,865
Although it should
take into account

1176
01:25:27,035 --> 01:25:30,994
my little knowledge
firearms.

1177
01:25:38,380 --> 01:25:39,278
Found.

1178
01:25:39,815 --> 01:25:42,375
Find! Good!

1179
01:25:42,551 --> 01:25:43,882
What a wonderful success!

1180
01:25:47,222 --> 01:25:48,883
The camel.

1181
01:25:49,057 --> 01:25:50,922
And there is no error.

1182
01:25:51,726 --> 01:25:52,624
Gentlemen ...

1183
01:25:54,629 --> 01:25:57,860
Gentlemen, I am sure
we find what they seek.

1184
01:25:58,467 --> 01:26:00,435
- Thank you, Mr. Chowdhury.
- It was a pleasure.

1185
01:26:09,644 --> 01:26:12,238
Without doubt
is the weapon of Miss. Jackie.

1186
01:26:15,784 --> 01:26:17,877
A new 22 Derringer,

1187
01:26:18,053 --> 01:26:20,351
- Four shots.
- Two bullets fired.

1188
01:26:21,656 --> 01:26:23,715
A scarf for man ...
Looks like blood.

1189
01:26:23,892 --> 01:26:27,089
A marble ashtray
to sink it.

1190
01:26:27,262 --> 01:26:29,594
And my shawl.

1191
01:26:29,764 --> 01:26:30,788
It's yours, madam?

1192
01:26:30,966 --> 01:26:34,060
Of course it's mine.
I lost last night in the lounge.

1193
01:26:35,070 --> 01:26:38,870
The murderer involved in the churning
to muffle the noise of gunshots.

1194
01:26:39,174 --> 01:26:42,405
What impertinence!
Crown Prince Carol

1195
01:26:42,577 --> 01:26:44,477
gave me this shawl
Romania.

1196
01:26:44,679 --> 01:26:47,910
People have no respect
the property of others.

1197
01:26:48,083 --> 01:26:50,813
Neither of the other for jewelry.

1198
01:26:52,521 --> 01:26:55,046
In that regard, sir?

1199
01:26:55,290 --> 01:26:57,554
I refer to pearls
Potsdam, lady

1200
01:26:57,726 --> 01:27:00,854
that belonged to Mrs. Doyle
and were subtracted.

1201
01:27:01,897 --> 01:27:03,023
Subtracted?

1202
01:27:03,498 --> 01:27:04,487
Taken.

1203
01:27:04,699 --> 01:27:05,825
Penthouses.

1204
01:27:07,002 --> 01:27:08,094
Stolen.

1205
01:27:09,004 --> 01:27:10,733
And why look at me

1206
01:27:10,906 --> 01:27:14,433
with that known
expression?

1207
01:27:14,609 --> 01:27:17,100
What has
Pearls me?

1208
01:27:17,913 --> 01:27:21,940
I'm the nasty spy
intruder, ma'am.

1209
01:27:22,617 --> 01:27:25,643
I heard that he admired
those pearls, which would

1210
01:27:25,820 --> 01:27:28,755
All his teeth''
to possess them.''

1211
01:27:28,924 --> 01:27:31,154
Maldita Bowers.

1212
01:27:31,326 --> 01:27:35,092
My theory is that you have
an obsessive love for jewelry,

1213
01:27:35,263 --> 01:27:37,857
that coveted pearls
Mrs. Doyle

1214
01:27:38,033 --> 01:27:39,864
and it was decided
to possess them

1215
01:27:40,035 --> 01:27:41,969
even through theft

1216
01:27:42,137 --> 01:27:45,368
or murder.

1217
01:27:45,540 --> 01:27:47,770
Do not deny it, ma'am.

1218
01:27:47,943 --> 01:27:51,174
I can see her walking
the deck yesterday evening

1219
01:27:51,446 --> 01:27:54,074
hoping that Mrs. Doyle
sleep.

1220
01:27:54,249 --> 01:27:55,273
Go to sleep.

1221
01:27:55,450 --> 01:27:57,213
See what happens in the salon.

1222
01:27:57,385 --> 01:27:58,443
Hey, Jackie.

1223
01:27:58,887 --> 01:28:00,013
I'll kill you first.

1224
01:28:00,188 --> 01:28:01,280
Jackie.

1225
01:28:02,657 --> 01:28:04,090
When the hall is empty

1226
01:28:04,259 --> 01:28:06,625
takes to get the gun.

1227
01:28:06,995 --> 01:28:08,690
Go to the box
Mrs. Doyle

1228
01:28:08,863 --> 01:28:11,229
knowing her husband
would not be there.

1229
01:28:18,974 --> 01:28:19,906
Throw it

1230
01:28:20,575 --> 01:28:24,306
and then steals the pearls
the bedside table.

1231
01:28:24,980 --> 01:28:26,880
Take that back

1232
01:28:27,115 --> 01:28:31,074
or I'll sue him for slander,
with the utmost rigor.

1233
01:28:31,486 --> 01:28:33,113
Will not match the rigor

1234
01:28:33,288 --> 01:28:35,415
which will check with
this boat

1235
01:28:35,590 --> 01:28:38,650
especially his cabin
in search of those gems.

1236
01:28:38,827 --> 01:28:40,260
I wish you a good afternoon.

1237
01:28:40,629 --> 01:28:43,723
You are a detestable
arrogant French.

1238
01:28:43,999 --> 01:28:46,263
Arrogant Belgian
Please, lady.

1239
01:28:49,738 --> 01:28:51,638
Need to be so rude
with you?

1240
01:28:51,906 --> 01:28:54,704
- It seems to accuse everybody.
- With good reason, sir.

1241
01:28:54,909 --> 01:28:57,104
Do you think that the old
not murder?

1242
01:28:57,312 --> 01:28:59,007
I think she
is with the pearls.

1243
01:28:59,214 --> 01:29:02,047
The question is whether he killed.
to get them

1244
01:29:02,217 --> 01:29:03,184
Mr Chowdhury.

1245
01:29:03,818 --> 01:29:04,750
Good luck.

1246
01:29:05,854 --> 01:29:07,845
- Yes, sir?
- We sailed now

1247
01:29:08,023 --> 01:29:09,149
I already gave the order.

1248
01:29:09,324 --> 01:29:12,623
Right now the coach
is working in the boiler.

1249
01:29:14,629 --> 01:29:15,527
Why the rush?

1250
01:29:15,730 --> 01:29:18,722
Friend, I feel the presence
evil around me.

1251
01:29:18,933 --> 01:29:21,595
The sooner we get
the Wadi Halfa, the better.

1252
01:29:22,237 --> 01:29:23,397
Keep it
in a safe place.

1253
01:29:23,571 --> 01:29:26,131
Beginning the search
pearls.

1254
01:29:37,252 --> 01:29:40,653
It's the last cabin.
Maybe he played in the water.

1255
01:29:41,956 --> 01:29:45,016
Forget missing
Pennington's cabin.

1256
01:29:45,193 --> 01:29:46,285
We'll review it now.

1257
01:29:46,461 --> 01:29:48,929
Hi, guys!

1258
01:29:49,097 --> 01:29:51,031
Our journey continues.

1259
01:29:51,199 --> 01:29:52,666
Good afternoon, ma'am.

1260
01:29:53,702 --> 01:29:55,829
Take a drink with me?

1261
01:29:56,004 --> 01:29:57,335
This wonderful young

1262
01:29:57,505 --> 01:30:00,702
just prepared
the most extraordinary mixture

1263
01:30:00,875 --> 01:30:03,810
native fruit juices.
It is called Golden Sebek

1264
01:30:03,978 --> 01:30:08,438
in honor of the God of the Old
City Crocodilopolis.

1265
01:30:08,616 --> 01:30:09,742
Not for me.

1266
01:30:09,918 --> 01:30:13,217
sometimes yank the dog
but not crocodile scales.

1267
01:30:13,388 --> 01:30:14,412
Race ...

1268
01:30:14,589 --> 01:30:16,750
How will the research

1269
01:30:16,925 --> 01:30:19,416
this tragic event,
Mr. Poirot?

1270
01:30:19,594 --> 01:30:22,757
Normally, as they say,
lady.

1271
01:30:22,931 --> 01:30:24,728
The crime of passion.

1272
01:30:24,899 --> 01:30:27,231
The primitive instinct to kill,

1273
01:30:27,402 --> 01:30:29,893
so related
with the sexual instinct.

1274
01:30:30,839 --> 01:30:34,070
I feel sorry for the poor
crazy Jackie,

1275
01:30:34,242 --> 01:30:36,142
changed their emotions,

1276
01:30:36,311 --> 01:30:37,938
your blood boiling,

1277
01:30:38,113 --> 01:30:41,014
wanting revenge on those who
stole her man.

1278
01:30:41,216 --> 01:30:44,151
Yes, of course
but may have been somebody else

1279
01:30:44,319 --> 01:30:46,480
a reason
also good.

1280
01:30:47,422 --> 01:30:48,480
Who?

1281
01:30:49,858 --> 01:30:51,257
The lady, Mrs. Otterbourne.

1282
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:54,558
- What was that?
- Now, her daughter and the lady know

1283
01:30:54,729 --> 01:30:56,390
that do not defame
the dead.

1284
01:30:56,564 --> 01:31:00,364
We no longer have to pay
that massive reparations.

1285
01:31:00,535 --> 01:31:03,231
- Yes but not to kill for it.
- No?

1286
01:31:04,372 --> 01:31:06,431
Another of these things gold.

1287
01:31:09,844 --> 01:31:11,243
Mrs. Otterbourne,

1288
01:31:12,747 --> 01:31:16,444
I see her looking at the hall,
through windows,

1289
01:31:17,152 --> 01:31:18,983
for that, as you said,

1290
01:31:19,154 --> 01:31:23,284
poor crazy Jackie,
shooting with Mr Doyle.

1291
01:31:23,658 --> 01:31:26,183
And then
when everyone leaves,

1292
01:31:26,361 --> 01:31:28,124
I see it going to get
gun

1293
01:31:28,296 --> 01:31:31,459
and then moving furtively
kill Mrs. Doyle.

1294
01:31:31,666 --> 01:31:32,325
No!

1295
01:31:32,500 --> 01:31:35,594
My world is love,
of passion and romance

1296
01:31:35,770 --> 01:31:37,203
and not cruel crimes.

1297
01:31:37,372 --> 01:31:39,135
Now, please
leave me in peace.

1298
01:31:39,307 --> 01:31:41,605
If the upset,
sorry.

1299
01:31:41,776 --> 01:31:43,539
Life can be very cruel!

1300
01:31:43,711 --> 01:31:47,306
We need the courage
to face the slander of life.

1301
01:31:50,084 --> 01:31:51,449
Barman.

1302
01:31:51,619 --> 01:31:54,452
The crocodile lost
their scales.

1303
01:31:57,058 --> 01:31:58,582
What most annoying woman!

1304
01:31:58,760 --> 01:32:00,625
Why not kill,
I wonder?

1305
01:32:00,795 --> 01:32:03,491
Maybe someday subscribers
of libraries

1306
01:32:03,664 --> 01:32:05,996
to meet and hire
a murderer.

1307
01:32:32,994 --> 01:32:35,053
Mrs. Van Schuyler
is very silly

1308
01:32:35,229 --> 01:32:37,720
to play with
Hercule Poirot.

1309
01:32:38,099 --> 01:32:41,227
You know it has no evidence
she stole them.

1310
01:32:41,402 --> 01:32:44,565
The return of Pearls
does not mean never

1311
01:32:44,739 --> 01:32:48,368
not killed
to steal them first.

1312
01:33:07,962 --> 01:33:09,122
Pennington?

1313
01:33:16,470 --> 01:33:19,268
We need to find
the document that he tried

1314
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:21,874
Mrs. Doyle to sign.

1315
01:33:22,043 --> 01:33:23,271
What is this?

1316
01:33:23,444 --> 01:33:25,105
- Poirot.
- Yes?

1317
01:33:26,347 --> 01:33:29,783
Ms.. Jackie was not the only
passenger who traveled armed.

1318
01:33:29,951 --> 01:33:31,475
It was not killed
the Linnet.

1319
01:33:31,652 --> 01:33:33,085
Obviously not.

1320
01:33:36,958 --> 01:33:38,619
How many words

1321
01:33:42,964 --> 01:33:44,761
You see better. See

1322
01:33:49,103 --> 01:33:50,297
What drug are you doing?

1323
01:33:50,705 --> 01:33:53,868
Viewing your documents
Particular, sir. It's not obvious?

1324
01:33:54,175 --> 01:33:55,665
You what?

1325
01:33:56,477 --> 01:33:58,877
Perhaps it is common in Paris
messing with things beyond

1326
01:33:59,046 --> 01:34:00,479
but we are not
in Paris.

1327
01:34:00,648 --> 01:34:01,740
Brussels, sir ...

1328
01:34:01,916 --> 01:34:03,406
I do not care if it's Borneo.

1329
01:34:03,885 --> 01:34:06,979
Not entitled
to be here.

1330
01:34:07,221 --> 01:34:10,122
We have every right.
While the police did not arrive

1331
01:34:10,291 --> 01:34:12,725
The Company has instructed
research.

1332
01:34:12,927 --> 01:34:15,259
No relation
with my documents.

1333
01:34:15,429 --> 01:34:18,762
They prove that, despite
Wedding of Mrs. Doyle,

1334
01:34:18,933 --> 01:34:21,595
you still trying
control her money.

1335
01:34:22,904 --> 01:34:25,634
So what?
There is no law prohibiting it.

1336
01:34:25,806 --> 01:34:27,967
Has the law against fraud
customers

1337
01:34:28,142 --> 01:34:30,337
and mine contractors
do not like it

1338
01:34:30,811 --> 01:34:32,039
Who are they?

1339
01:34:32,413 --> 01:34:34,540
Lawyers
English Mrs. Doyle

1340
01:34:34,715 --> 01:34:36,945
and we are not satisfied
to see how you

1341
01:34:37,118 --> 01:34:39,450
and his partner are careful
her business.

1342
01:34:39,620 --> 01:34:41,451
- Go to hell!
- One moment.

1343
01:34:41,622 --> 01:34:44,352
- Everything is in perfect order.
- Would that it were true.

1344
01:34:44,525 --> 01:34:48,256
I think we came to do it
sign this proxy

1345
01:34:48,429 --> 01:34:49,453
and failed.

1346
01:34:49,630 --> 01:34:52,497
So was the
Temple of Amun.

1347
01:34:53,534 --> 01:34:56,560
He climbed to the tallest pillar.

1348
01:35:08,849 --> 01:35:11,579
There he pushed a stone
that fell

1349
01:35:11,752 --> 01:35:14,243
and that for some, not killed.

1350
01:35:21,095 --> 01:35:22,562
You can not blame it on me.

1351
01:35:22,730 --> 01:35:24,857
Get out!
I've heard too much garbage.

1352
01:35:25,166 --> 01:35:30,661
One day you will hear more trash mouth
of a public prosecutor.

1353
01:35:30,838 --> 01:35:32,999
This is yours, I guess.

1354
01:35:33,174 --> 01:35:34,266
Belgium.

1355
01:35:42,783 --> 01:35:44,876
Let us prepare for dinner.

1356
01:35:45,987 --> 01:35:47,045
J'ai faim''.''

1357
01:35:47,221 --> 01:35:50,122
- Poirot,''you have a woman''?
-''Femme''is a woman.

1358
01:35:50,291 --> 01:35:52,020
J'ai faim''''is''I'm hungry.''

1359
01:35:55,196 --> 01:35:57,096
I need to talk to that young

1360
01:35:57,298 --> 01:35:59,323
I'll see you at the restaurant,
sir.

1361
01:35:59,500 --> 01:36:02,128
Ask me les morilles''''
please.

1362
01:36:02,303 --> 01:36:04,897
Morilles''''Les?
Ah, eel!

1363
01:36:11,512 --> 01:36:13,571
How are you, young lady?

1364
01:36:14,515 --> 01:36:17,075
Hardly, Mr. Poirot.

1365
01:36:17,251 --> 01:36:19,378
I'm so ashamed.

1366
01:36:19,553 --> 01:36:21,043
His wife died e. ..

1367
01:36:21,222 --> 01:36:22,985
Now he's all yours again.

1368
01:36:25,626 --> 01:36:28,789
It is wrong to
he comes back?

1369
01:36:28,963 --> 01:36:30,260
I still love him

1370
01:36:30,431 --> 01:36:32,558
now he needs me
more than ever.

1371
01:36:32,733 --> 01:36:34,758
Mr Poirot, could ...?

1372
01:36:34,935 --> 01:36:36,869
It could take me to see it?

1373
01:36:37,038 --> 01:36:38,972
Only five minutes.
Please?

1374
01:36:40,041 --> 01:36:41,372
I do not see why not.

1375
01:36:41,542 --> 01:36:46,070
If he wants
and the doctor does not object

1376
01:36:46,247 --> 01:36:47,942
I'll ask.

1377
01:36:52,553 --> 01:36:53,884
Good!

1378
01:36:54,555 --> 01:36:56,079
The fever broke.

1379
01:36:56,257 --> 01:36:57,690
Okay, Mr. Poirot.

1380
01:36:57,858 --> 01:37:00,292
I have no objection
if the visit is short.

1381
01:37:00,461 --> 01:37:03,453
- Five minutes max, right?
- Thank you, Doctor.

1382
01:37:04,832 --> 01:37:06,459
Miss Jackie.

1383
01:37:07,268 --> 01:37:08,530
You can see it now.

1384
01:37:09,670 --> 01:37:11,331
Thank you!

1385
01:37:13,474 --> 01:37:15,305
- Hi, Jackie.
- Simon.

1386
01:37:19,513 --> 01:37:21,674
Sorry for the Linnet.

1387
01:37:22,983 --> 01:37:26,316
- Thanks.
- Simon, I did not kill her. I swear.

1388
01:37:26,487 --> 01:37:28,819
No need to say it.

1389
01:37:28,989 --> 01:37:30,081
I know.

1390
01:37:33,694 --> 01:37:35,924
Forgive me, please.

1391
01:37:36,097 --> 01:37:37,086
Jackie.

1392
01:37:38,332 --> 01:37:41,460
Last night I was crazy.
He could have killed you.

1393
01:37:42,036 --> 01:37:44,800
With a gun
decoration like that?

1394
01:37:45,806 --> 01:37:48,639
Will you ...?
Will walk again?

1395
01:37:48,809 --> 01:37:50,003
Do not be silly.

1396
01:37:50,611 --> 01:37:53,876
In Wadi Halfa will take me
the bullet and stay like new.

1397
01:37:58,119 --> 01:38:01,020
Remember that only five minutes,
OK?

1398
01:38:02,223 --> 01:38:04,453
Simon, I'm so sorry!

1399
01:38:04,625 --> 01:38:08,083
Quiet.
No need to apologize.

1400
01:38:27,882 --> 01:38:29,008
What is this?

1401
01:38:30,551 --> 01:38:32,576
I ordered a plate of morilles''.''

1402
01:38:32,753 --> 01:38:35,415
- And what's that in your country?
- Champinhon

1403
01:38:35,589 --> 01:38:36,578
Sorry.

1404
01:38:36,757 --> 01:38:40,318
I thought you wanted an eel.
They just have it.

1405
01:38:40,494 --> 01:38:42,894
- Ask another bottle.
- Why?

1406
01:38:43,063 --> 01:38:46,294
Because the remains of the bottle
yesterday contained verdigris.

1407
01:38:46,467 --> 01:38:48,799
- Verdigris?
- Yes, grain had.

1408
01:38:48,969 --> 01:38:53,030
It is the normal sediment
Chateau Petrus wine.

1409
01:38:56,777 --> 01:38:58,745
- Want a cup?
- No thanks.

1410
01:38:58,913 --> 01:39:00,904
Keep your wine
I'll take the whiskey.

1411
01:39:01,415 --> 01:39:03,975
Always drink whiskey?
Wine ...

1412
01:39:05,085 --> 01:39:06,712
How strange!

1413
01:39:06,887 --> 01:39:08,752
Of course.

1414
01:39:15,196 --> 01:39:16,493
Can I sit?

1415
01:39:17,231 --> 01:39:20,530
Poirot, in my opinion,
all could have done that

1416
01:39:20,701 --> 01:39:22,760
everyone had a reason
for this.

1417
01:39:22,937 --> 01:39:23,926
It's incredible.

1418
01:39:24,538 --> 01:39:25,937
Absolutely.

1419
01:39:28,108 --> 01:39:29,735
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

1420
01:39:38,319 --> 01:39:40,810
Good evening, ma'am.
Please.

1421
01:40:19,960 --> 01:40:21,393
Come quickly.

1422
01:40:21,562 --> 01:40:22,654
Fast.

1423
01:40:37,611 --> 01:40:39,476
- Call Dr. Bessner.
- Yes, sir.

1424
01:40:45,286 --> 01:40:46,378
You know what this is?

1425
01:40:48,889 --> 01:40:50,015
Money.

1426
01:40:50,190 --> 01:40:52,454
Looks like a piece of note
thousand francs.

1427
01:40:52,626 --> 01:40:53,718
It must have been blackmail.

1428
01:40:53,894 --> 01:40:56,089
She knew something killer
of Linnet Doyle.

1429
01:41:00,200 --> 01:41:01,861
As we were idiots!

1430
01:41:02,603 --> 01:41:04,002
I knew it.

1431
01:41:06,206 --> 01:41:08,572
What she said this afternoon?

1432
01:41:08,742 --> 01:41:11,540
''If you could not sleep

1433
01:41:11,712 --> 01:41:14,738
Had he been on deck

1434
01:41:14,915 --> 01:41:17,145
might have seen the killer

1435
01:41:17,318 --> 01:41:20,014
enter or leave the cabin
Lady Doyle.''

1436
01:41:21,755 --> 01:41:24,849
That's what happened.
She saw the killer.

1437
01:41:25,025 --> 01:41:27,755
And because of their greed,
now dead.

1438
01:41:28,362 --> 01:41:29,954
And how does this help us?

1439
01:41:30,130 --> 01:41:32,098
We do not know
who killed them.

1440
01:41:32,266 --> 01:41:34,257
No. This is not
exactly true.

1441
01:41:34,635 --> 01:41:37,866
We went the wrong way,
us.

1442
01:41:38,038 --> 01:41:41,633
We know almost everything
what there is to know.

1443
01:41:43,043 --> 01:41:45,671
But what we know seems

1444
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:48,575
looks awesome.

1445
01:41:50,250 --> 01:41:51,308
Impossible.

1446
01:41:54,254 --> 01:41:55,881
Murders.

1447
01:41:56,056 --> 01:41:58,183
Murder!

1448
01:41:58,359 --> 01:42:00,418
All the time the murders.

1449
01:42:04,164 --> 01:42:06,064
He died less than
one hour

1450
01:42:07,568 --> 01:42:09,195
The beheaded.

1451
01:42:11,171 --> 01:42:13,002
With a thin knife.

1452
01:42:17,211 --> 01:42:18,473
One like this.

1453
01:42:19,380 --> 01:42:20,813
Very interesting, Doctor.

1454
01:42:20,981 --> 01:42:22,972
sure you do not miss
none of yours?

1455
01:42:24,184 --> 01:42:25,208
What?

1456
01:42:27,287 --> 01:42:30,586
So now I think,
Ludwig Bessner,

1457
01:42:30,791 --> 01:42:33,259
I killed this humble servant?

1458
01:42:34,228 --> 01:42:35,889
My God!

1459
01:42:36,063 --> 01:42:37,257
What I have to do

1460
01:42:37,431 --> 01:42:39,661
with the issues
of the lower classes?

1461
01:42:40,634 --> 01:42:43,068
It is well known that they do not suffer
neurosis ...

1462
01:42:43,237 --> 01:42:45,205
only animal passions

1463
01:42:51,412 --> 01:42:53,744
- Take your body to the chamber.
- Yes, sir.

1464
01:42:56,450 --> 01:42:57,974
Think you already know, huh?

1465
01:42:58,152 --> 01:43:00,347
I confess that I have
no clarity.

1466
01:43:00,521 --> 01:43:03,388
Dr. Bessner told me
what happened to the maid.

1467
01:43:03,557 --> 01:43:07,049
I need to talk to you
and Mr. Doyle immediately.

1468
01:43:07,828 --> 01:43:10,353
I would not get.
Dr. Bessner is boring.

1469
01:43:10,531 --> 01:43:12,089
My good man, I know.

1470
01:43:12,266 --> 01:43:14,325
But an upset
will not stop me.

1471
01:43:14,535 --> 01:43:15,934
Believe me, I know everything

1472
01:43:17,738 --> 01:43:20,263
Mr. Doyle, I know who killed
Louise Bourget.

1473
01:43:20,441 --> 01:43:21,601
What?

1474
01:43:21,775 --> 01:43:23,572
You know who killed Louise?

1475
01:43:23,744 --> 01:43:25,473
Easy. Do not scream.

1476
01:43:25,746 --> 01:43:28,214
Mrs. Otterbourne,
can not stay here.

1477
01:43:28,382 --> 01:43:29,713
He needs rest

1478
01:43:29,883 --> 01:43:31,475
is of vital importance.

1479
01:43:31,652 --> 01:43:33,882
I know everything, everything, believe me.

1480
01:43:34,054 --> 01:43:36,352
Look, I will not tolerate,
elbows.

1481
01:43:37,391 --> 01:43:39,985
Mr. Doyle, I
Salome Otterbourne

1482
01:43:40,160 --> 01:43:42,287
triumphed where
others have failed.

1483
01:43:42,463 --> 01:43:45,398
I'm still best detective
that the great Hercule Poirot.

1484
01:43:45,566 --> 01:43:48,592
Mrs. Otterbourne,
God, calm down.

1485
01:43:49,369 --> 01:43:51,997
Now tell us the story
from the beginning.

1486
01:43:52,473 --> 01:43:55,806
- I refuse to speak in front of him.
- So do not tell.

1487
01:43:55,976 --> 01:43:57,409
Outside, now.

1488
01:43:57,578 --> 01:43:59,671
- The fever has increased the confusion.
- Doctor

1489
01:43:59,980 --> 01:44:02,505
will rise more if we do not hear
what she has to say.

1490
01:44:02,683 --> 01:44:06,119
- Mr. Doyle.
- It's about my wife.

1491
01:44:06,920 --> 01:44:09,184
Yes
Yeah, okay.

1492
01:44:09,423 --> 01:44:11,323
You can get 3 minutes.

1493
01:44:11,492 --> 01:44:12,720
Three minutes.

1494
01:44:13,126 --> 01:44:15,560
And lowers his voice, see?

1495
01:44:17,097 --> 01:44:18,121
What a woman!

1496
01:44:20,534 --> 01:44:22,331
Nasty little man.

1497
01:44:22,503 --> 01:44:26,439
Madam, you have evidence to prove
Who killed Mrs. Doyle?

1498
01:44:26,607 --> 01:44:29,542
I get it and I do.

1499
01:44:29,710 --> 01:44:31,439
Would you agree,
is not it,

1500
01:44:31,612 --> 01:44:33,637
that whoever killed
Louise Bourget

1501
01:44:33,814 --> 01:44:36,112
Linnet Doyle also killed?

1502
01:44:36,316 --> 01:44:38,181
It is quite possible.

1503
01:44:38,352 --> 01:44:40,149
Well,

1504
01:44:40,320 --> 01:44:42,550
I saw who killed
Louise Bourget

1505
01:44:42,723 --> 01:44:45,055
with my own eyes.

1506
01:44:51,064 --> 01:44:52,622
Please proceed, ma'am.

1507
01:44:53,233 --> 01:44:56,566
I was in the stern of the boat,
talking to a crew member

1508
01:44:56,870 --> 01:44:59,304
I showed
fascinating.

1509
01:44:59,473 --> 01:45:03,739
A buffalo and a camel, together
in a plowing match.

1510
01:45:04,044 --> 01:45:06,945
He saw everything in the moonlight,
of course, is not it?

1511
01:45:07,948 --> 01:45:09,813
- Yeah, right.
- Yes.

1512
01:45:09,983 --> 01:45:12,008
I have a vision
extraordinary.

1513
01:45:13,153 --> 01:45:14,552
Well, I walked away ...

1514
01:45:14,855 --> 01:45:17,085
and suddenly, when I went
the corridor

1515
01:45:17,257 --> 01:45:18,781
I heard a scream.

1516
01:45:19,359 --> 01:45:22,453
Came from the cabin
Louise Bourget.

1517
01:45:22,963 --> 01:45:25,397
Then I saw that the door
box opened

1518
01:45:25,766 --> 01:45:27,393
When the door opened wider

1519
01:45:27,668 --> 01:45:29,101
I saw it was ..

1520
01:45:46,587 --> 01:45:47,713
It is the Pennington.

1521
01:46:01,902 --> 01:46:03,733
I heard a sharp click.

1522
01:46:03,904 --> 01:46:04,928
What now?

1523
01:46:05,105 --> 01:46:07,096
Shot at
Mrs. Otterbourne.

1524
01:46:13,213 --> 01:46:14,544
- Mr. Pennington.
- Yes?

1525
01:46:14,715 --> 01:46:16,239
It's your gun, I think

1526
01:46:16,750 --> 01:46:18,843
Anyone can
have it taken out of the cabin.

1527
01:46:19,019 --> 01:46:20,350
They knew it was there.

1528
01:46:20,520 --> 01:46:23,182
There are some who always said
take gun when I travel.

1529
01:46:23,357 --> 01:46:25,985
The killing must stop.

1530
01:46:26,159 --> 01:46:28,457
Unfortunately,
I took too much.

1531
01:46:28,629 --> 01:46:32,258
I want to see everyone in the hall

1532
01:46:32,432 --> 01:46:34,366
where all will be revealed ...

1533
01:46:34,935 --> 01:46:37,096
here ...

1534
01:46:37,270 --> 01:46:38,862
thirty minutes.

1535
01:46:45,245 --> 01:46:47,179
I do not believe.

1536
01:46:47,347 --> 01:46:48,837
My mother died.

1537
01:46:49,549 --> 01:46:51,710
Why?

1538
01:46:51,885 --> 01:46:53,182
Must have discovered something.

1539
01:46:53,353 --> 01:46:56,379
My God! Poor thing!

1540
01:46:56,556 --> 01:46:58,717
I loved her, though.

1541
01:47:00,260 --> 01:47:02,888
And now she's gone.

1542
01:47:03,063 --> 01:47:05,691
I can not assimilate it.

1543
01:47:05,866 --> 01:47:07,197
Suddenly I was ...

1544
01:47:08,568 --> 01:47:09,694
Alone.

1545
01:47:11,905 --> 01:47:13,270
No, it is not.

1546
01:47:14,574 --> 01:47:15,905
I'll look after you.

1547
01:47:17,811 --> 01:47:19,073
Jim.

1548
01:47:21,181 --> 01:47:22,079
Poor Mom.

1549
01:47:22,616 --> 01:47:24,811
You would not have missed it

1550
01:47:24,985 --> 01:47:27,510
while alive.

1551
01:47:47,908 --> 01:47:51,537
Ladies,
ladies, gentlemen.

1552
01:47:51,712 --> 01:47:53,839
The game is over.

1553
01:47:54,014 --> 01:47:55,675
I, Hercule Poirot

1554
01:47:55,849 --> 01:47:58,841
I now know without a doubt
Who killed Mrs. Doyle

1555
01:47:59,019 --> 01:48:01,852
Louise Bourget
and Mrs. Otterbourne.

1556
01:48:02,556 --> 01:48:05,957
Foolishly I started the research
with the preconceived idea

1557
01:48:06,126 --> 01:48:09,220
that was a witness
the scene of aggression

1558
01:48:09,396 --> 01:48:12,957
between Mlle. Jackie
and Simon Doyle.

1559
01:48:13,133 --> 01:48:16,000
That this person had
taken the gun

1560
01:48:16,169 --> 01:48:19,468
after all
had left the hall

1561
01:48:19,639 --> 01:48:22,164
and would have used
to kill Mrs. Doyle

1562
01:48:22,342 --> 01:48:26,073
and try to incriminate
Mlle. Jackie.

1563
01:48:26,246 --> 01:48:31,616
As you will see, friends,
suspects were not lacking among you.

1564
01:48:31,785 --> 01:48:36,119
It could be someone who tried
shut your mouth defamatory.

1565
01:48:36,289 --> 01:48:40,020
Or who ascribe the ruin
the father of Mrs. Doyle.

1566
01:48:40,193 --> 01:48:43,424
Or someone obsessed
the idea of a theft.

1567
01:48:43,597 --> 01:48:48,091
Or someone resentful
with the heirs of fortunes.

1568
01:48:48,268 --> 01:48:51,726
Or someone with a firm decision
to save his mother

1569
01:48:51,905 --> 01:48:54,305
from financial ruin.

1570
01:48:54,474 --> 01:48:55,839
Or even

1571
01:48:56,009 --> 01:49:00,571
someone to escape punishment
as curator fraudulent.

1572
01:49:02,082 --> 01:49:06,246
Or someone who mistook
the victim's identity.

1573
01:49:12,192 --> 01:49:14,023
And then ...

1574
01:49:14,194 --> 01:49:16,128
I remembered something
very important

1575
01:49:16,730 --> 01:49:18,664
That night I slept soundly

1576
01:49:18,832 --> 01:49:20,925
rather lightly,
as is my custom.

1577
01:49:21,101 --> 01:49:21,897
Why?

1578
01:49:22,702 --> 01:49:25,364
Why was placed
something in my wine

1579
01:49:25,539 --> 01:49:28,235
by someone who did not want
I was present

1580
01:49:28,408 --> 01:49:30,433
the events of the night.

1581
01:49:31,011 --> 01:49:32,273
Very easy.

1582
01:49:32,445 --> 01:49:35,073
The open bottles
are left on the tables.

1583
01:49:35,615 --> 01:49:36,843
You, sir

1584
01:49:37,017 --> 01:49:40,282
returned the bottle saying,
using their own words

1585
01:49:40,453 --> 01:49:42,148
I had verdigris.

1586
01:49:42,322 --> 01:49:43,448
This, in itself,

1587
01:49:43,623 --> 01:49:47,150
implies premeditation
by someone.

1588
01:49:47,928 --> 01:49:49,361
It means that yesterday

1589
01:49:49,529 --> 01:49:54,262
before 7:30,
the crime was already decided.

1590
01:49:55,235 --> 01:49:58,568
There was something that confused me
from the beginning.

1591
01:49:58,738 --> 01:50:02,265
If the intention was to blame
Mlle. Jackie ...

1592
01:50:02,442 --> 01:50:05,969
why the gun was not
Mrs. Doyle's room?

1593
01:50:06,146 --> 01:50:07,613
and then get it.

1594
01:50:07,781 --> 01:50:11,217
The killer had pulled a gun
because it ...

1595
01:50:11,384 --> 01:50:14,444
or she had to cut it.
There was another reason.

1596
01:50:14,855 --> 01:50:16,584
And there was something more.

1597
01:50:17,991 --> 01:50:19,390
Dr. Bessner,

1598
01:50:19,559 --> 01:50:21,754
you examined the body
Mrs. Doyle?

1599
01:50:24,064 --> 01:50:24,962
Yes

1600
01:50:25,799 --> 01:50:29,496
Remember the scorched
around the wound?

1601
01:50:29,669 --> 01:50:33,161
The gun was very close
your head when shot.

1602
01:50:33,874 --> 01:50:35,068
This correct.

1603
01:50:36,276 --> 01:50:39,336
But when we recover
the weapon of the Nile

1604
01:50:39,512 --> 01:50:42,606
she was involved
this silk shawl.

1605
01:50:42,782 --> 01:50:45,842
Evidently they had fired,
through it,

1606
01:50:46,019 --> 01:50:48,214
supposed to cushion
the noise of the shot.

1607
01:50:49,522 --> 01:50:50,750
Dr. Bessner,

1608
01:50:50,924 --> 01:50:54,360
if he had been shot
the shawl

1609
01:50:54,728 --> 01:50:58,061
would not have singed
the temple of Mrs. Doyle?

1610
01:50:59,399 --> 01:51:02,425
I mean, the shot that killed her
could not have been fired

1611
01:51:02,602 --> 01:51:04,001
using the shawl.

1612
01:51:05,305 --> 01:51:07,034
So maybe it was the other.

1613
01:51:07,207 --> 01:51:10,370
What Jackie of Bellefort
Simon Doyle shot.

1614
01:51:10,944 --> 01:51:11,808
Jackie.

1615
01:51:14,047 --> 01:51:17,107
But we had a witness.
We knew it was not.

1616
01:51:18,518 --> 01:51:21,316
So
There was a third shot,

1617
01:51:24,624 --> 01:51:26,922
which we know nothing.

1618
01:51:28,728 --> 01:51:30,559
However

1619
01:51:30,730 --> 01:51:34,689
only two bullets were missing
the revolver.

1620
01:51:43,944 --> 01:51:46,071
The next curious
circumstance

1621
01:51:46,446 --> 01:51:49,142
occurred in the cabin
Mrs. Doyle.

1622
01:51:50,150 --> 01:51:53,278
There I found two glasses
of nail varnish.

1623
01:51:53,453 --> 01:51:55,318
In a jar was marked
Rosa''''

1624
01:51:55,488 --> 01:51:57,922
but the few drops
who remained there

1625
01:51:58,091 --> 01:52:00,582
were not rosy but
red.

1626
01:52:00,760 --> 01:52:03,729
and instead of smell
normal enamel,

1627
01:52:03,897 --> 01:52:05,057
vinegar.

1628
01:52:06,299 --> 01:52:09,496
Friends, it was red ink ...

1629
01:52:09,669 --> 01:52:12,399
I had a connection
inevitable

1630
01:52:12,772 --> 01:52:15,639
with this scarf,
we find

1631
01:52:15,809 --> 01:52:18,801
along with the revolver
wrapped in the shawl.

1632
01:52:18,979 --> 01:52:21,311
The paint comes off easily
tissue

1633
01:52:21,481 --> 01:52:23,676
leaving a stain
pink.

1634
01:52:24,684 --> 01:52:26,914
Then something happened

1635
01:52:27,087 --> 01:52:29,681
that explained everything,
without a doubt.

1636
01:52:30,690 --> 01:52:32,783
Louise Bourget was murdered

1637
01:52:33,093 --> 01:52:36,153
because he was blackmailing
with the killer.

1638
01:52:36,329 --> 01:52:40,732
We know this not only by
piece of thousand-franc note

1639
01:52:40,900 --> 01:52:44,666
we find
between your fingers inert

1640
01:52:44,838 --> 01:52:49,434
but also by a few words
who said curious

1641
01:52:49,609 --> 01:52:50,837
this morning.

1642
01:52:51,711 --> 01:52:52,837
Naturally

1643
01:52:53,013 --> 01:52:54,776
could not sleep if ...

1644
01:52:54,948 --> 01:52:58,076
Naturally,
it could not sleep

1645
01:52:58,251 --> 01:53:00,242
if the deck

1646
01:53:00,420 --> 01:53:02,479
might have seen
the killer

1647
01:53:02,655 --> 01:53:05,715
enter or leave the cabin
lady.

1648
01:53:07,427 --> 01:53:10,260
What, exactly,
it told us?

1649
01:53:11,965 --> 01:53:16,402
What, exactly,
she told us

1650
01:53:16,569 --> 01:53:17,934
with that?

1651
01:53:20,440 --> 01:53:22,067
If she was on deck

1652
01:53:22,242 --> 01:53:23,470
she saw the killer.

1653
01:53:23,643 --> 01:53:26,874
Yes .. but still did not understand
I refer, sir.

1654
01:53:27,047 --> 01:53:29,743
Why do we say this?

1655
01:53:30,383 --> 01:53:31,680
As a sign?

1656
01:53:31,851 --> 01:53:35,048
As a sign, of course.
But why us?

1657
01:53:36,556 --> 01:53:38,353
If you knew who the killer

1658
01:53:38,525 --> 01:53:41,892
Could do something
tell us or shut up

1659
01:53:42,062 --> 01:53:45,190
demand for money
the person involved.

1660
01:53:45,365 --> 01:53:47,299
But he made no
of both.

1661
01:53:47,467 --> 01:53:49,526
Used the conditional tense.

1662
01:53:49,702 --> 01:53:51,533
If he had been''...''

1663
01:53:51,704 --> 01:53:54,104
Could only mean
it was a sign, yes,

1664
01:53:54,274 --> 01:53:57,903
but it was a sign
for the killer.

1665
01:53:58,078 --> 01:54:00,672
That is, it was present
at that time.

1666
01:54:03,183 --> 01:54:06,118
But besides the two of us

1667
01:54:06,286 --> 01:54:08,618
just another person
was present.

1668
01:54:08,788 --> 01:54:11,450
Precisely.
Simon Doyle.

1669
01:54:13,626 --> 01:54:14,422
What?

1670
01:54:20,100 --> 01:54:21,067
Yes

1671
01:54:21,234 --> 01:54:24,226
The doctor was always there.
She had to speak.

1672
01:54:24,404 --> 01:54:27,032
- Perhaps not had a chance.
- Do not be so ridiculous.

1673
01:54:27,207 --> 01:54:31,143
I do not think that is ridiculous.
I remember well your answer.

1674
01:54:31,311 --> 01:54:32,835
''Will protect you.''

1675
01:54:33,012 --> 01:54:35,742
Nobody is accusing you''
anything.''

1676
01:54:35,915 --> 01:54:39,681
Exact security
she wanted to e. ..

1677
01:54:39,853 --> 01:54:40,820
obtained.

1678
01:54:44,958 --> 01:54:46,653
Mr P.

1679
01:54:46,826 --> 01:54:49,556
This time it was ridiculous
no doubt.

1680
01:54:49,729 --> 01:54:53,290
I have witnesses to prove
that could not killing the Linnet.

1681
01:54:53,566 --> 01:54:55,363
I know you have ...

1682
01:54:55,535 --> 01:54:57,469
but rather killed

1683
01:54:57,637 --> 01:54:59,662
and Louise Bourget saw.

1684
01:55:00,640 --> 01:55:03,006
What nonsense!
I say that Mr. Doyle

1685
01:55:03,176 --> 01:55:06,111
could not move
with a fractured leg.

1686
01:55:06,279 --> 01:55:10,181
This I testify
before any court in the world.

1687
01:55:10,350 --> 01:55:13,979
And I'd have to say
that their testimony is

1688
01:55:14,754 --> 01:55:16,119
- Irrelevant.
- Irrelevant?

1689
01:55:16,289 --> 01:55:18,257
l-le-van-rre-te.

1690
01:55:19,058 --> 01:55:20,787
Irrelevant?

1691
01:55:22,061 --> 01:55:23,050
I?

1692
01:55:24,764 --> 01:55:26,163
I have witnessed

1693
01:55:26,366 --> 01:55:30,097
where psychological
most complex of the century.

1694
01:55:30,270 --> 01:55:32,966
Just my testimony
Strutzrumple saved ...

1695
01:55:33,139 --> 01:55:36,700
the murderer of Dresden,
implementation.

1696
01:55:36,876 --> 01:55:38,207
- And in the case of ...
- Easy.

1697
01:55:38,378 --> 01:55:40,107
I just said it is irrelevant

1698
01:55:40,280 --> 01:55:42,305
because he began attending
Mr. Doyle

1699
01:55:42,482 --> 01:55:44,882
five minutes after
to shoot him.

1700
01:55:45,118 --> 01:55:48,554
He could not move during
those five minutes.

1701
01:55:48,721 --> 01:55:51,417
Sure, if they had already
shot. But was it?

1702
01:55:53,293 --> 01:55:56,956
Consider
what was actually seen.

1703
01:55:57,330 --> 01:55:59,560
Ms.. Rosalie
Jacqueline saw the shooting.

1704
01:56:00,700 --> 01:56:02,964
Doyle saw the drop to the ground.

1705
01:56:03,136 --> 01:56:06,333
And then to go for help
met with Ferguson

1706
01:56:06,506 --> 01:56:08,098
I had heard the shot.

1707
01:56:08,908 --> 01:56:13,572
He only saw the pressing Doyle
a red bandanna on his leg.

1708
01:56:13,746 --> 01:56:16,476
Doyle assumed that
had been shot.

1709
01:56:16,649 --> 01:56:19,277
but the assumption
I was wrong.

1710
01:56:19,452 --> 01:56:23,582
The bullet missed the Doyle.
It was somewhere else.

1711
01:56:23,756 --> 01:56:25,280
And now what happens?

1712
01:56:25,458 --> 01:56:28,586
Doyle insists that lead to Jackie
for your cabin

1713
01:56:28,761 --> 01:56:30,524
and not to leave alone.

1714
01:56:31,965 --> 01:56:36,459
Ms.. Rosalie and Mr. Ferguson
to follow up the cabin.

1715
01:56:36,636 --> 01:56:37,466
After

1716
01:56:37,637 --> 01:56:40,731
Mlle. Rosalie
Miss picks. Bowers ...

1717
01:56:42,141 --> 01:56:46,305
and all the attention is focused
elsewhere in the boat.

1718
01:56:46,479 --> 01:56:47,275
Mlle. Bowers.

1719
01:56:58,591 --> 01:57:01,492
Doyle need only
two minutes.

1720
01:57:01,661 --> 01:57:03,253
Take your shoes off ...

1721
01:57:03,463 --> 01:57:05,590
Grab the gun
under the couch

1722
01:57:05,765 --> 01:57:09,496
where Jackie gou
not to meet him ...

1723
01:57:09,669 --> 01:57:12,297
runs like a hare
the deck ...

1724
01:57:13,506 --> 01:57:16,202
and enters the cabin
of his wife.

1725
01:57:58,451 --> 01:58:00,942
After Doyle takes the shawl
Mrs. Van Schuyler

1726
01:58:01,120 --> 01:58:04,385
I had hidden,
involves the revolver

1727
01:58:04,557 --> 01:58:08,152
to dampen noise
and avoiding the scorched ...

1728
01:58:08,328 --> 01:58:10,819
fires a bullet
in his own leg.

1729
01:58:21,474 --> 01:58:23,908
Removes a cartridge
used,

1730
01:58:24,077 --> 01:58:25,567
that discards ...

1731
01:58:26,846 --> 01:58:28,507
and introduces a new

1732
01:58:28,681 --> 01:58:31,115
indicating if the gun
is found,

1733
01:58:31,284 --> 01:58:33,980
they were only fired
two bullets.

1734
01:58:48,468 --> 01:58:50,834
It involves new
stole the weapon in

1735
01:58:51,003 --> 01:58:52,561
joins the stained handkerchief

1736
01:58:52,772 --> 01:58:56,640
and a marble ashtray
for everything to sink

1737
01:58:56,809 --> 01:59:00,836
and throws the packet on the Nile
the window.

1738
01:59:01,013 --> 01:59:03,413
Leans back on the couch

1739
01:59:03,583 --> 01:59:07,212
squeezing the wound
with another tissue

1740
01:59:07,387 --> 01:59:10,914
this time
in agony.

1741
01:59:18,798 --> 01:59:21,426
Extraordinary, is not it?

1742
01:59:21,601 --> 01:59:22,932
Impossible.

1743
01:59:23,102 --> 01:59:24,330
Cost to believe.

1744
01:59:24,504 --> 01:59:26,836
Of course it does.
Absolutely impossible.

1745
01:59:27,006 --> 01:59:28,337
Why say that?

1746
01:59:28,508 --> 01:59:30,942
You even said that he had
heard quick steps.

1747
01:59:31,110 --> 01:59:33,510
Why would anyone run?

1748
01:59:33,679 --> 01:59:36,239
I know but do it all
impulsively?

1749
01:59:36,716 --> 01:59:39,241
Once and for all,
sir, it was not impulsive

1750
01:59:39,419 --> 01:59:41,046
was carefully
planned.

1751
01:59:41,587 --> 01:59:42,349
By Doyle?

1752
01:59:42,722 --> 01:59:45,156
Doyle represented only
a role.

1753
01:59:45,324 --> 01:59:47,485
It was planned by his accomplice,

1754
01:59:47,660 --> 01:59:50,128
Mlle. Jacqueline
of Bellefort.

1755
01:59:53,833 --> 01:59:55,801
You must be crazy.

1756
01:59:56,769 --> 01:59:58,600
No, I'm not crazy.

1757
01:59:58,771 --> 02:00:00,966
It's the truth.

1758
02:00:01,140 --> 02:00:03,665
Who gave Doyle an alibi?

1759
02:00:03,843 --> 02:00:06,038
You, to shoot the shot.

1760
02:00:06,846 --> 02:00:08,973
And who gave you an alibi?

1761
02:00:09,482 --> 02:00:10,813
Doyle

1762
02:00:10,983 --> 02:00:14,384
insisting to stay together
all night.

1763
02:00:14,954 --> 02:00:17,684
Not true. Not.

1764
02:00:17,990 --> 02:00:20,458
Yes, indeed.
To deny that?

1765
02:00:21,861 --> 02:00:24,091
You and Doyle were lovers.

1766
02:00:24,263 --> 02:00:26,231
Are still lovers.

1767
02:00:26,399 --> 02:00:28,594
The plan for Simon
kill his wife

1768
02:00:28,768 --> 02:00:32,169
inherit the money,
and then at a later date,

1769
02:00:32,371 --> 02:00:34,896
marry
with his former love.

1770
02:00:35,074 --> 02:00:37,702
A very bright idea.

1771
02:00:37,877 --> 02:00:40,004
You chasing
Mrs. Doyle ...

1772
02:00:40,179 --> 02:00:42,443
simulated the wrath of Simon ...

1773
02:00:42,615 --> 02:00:45,550
the choice of Miss. Rosalie
as a witness ...

1774
02:00:45,718 --> 02:00:48,278
and the whole evolution up to
arrive at the crime ...

1775
02:00:48,488 --> 02:00:50,319
the exaggerated hysteria ...

1776
02:00:51,324 --> 02:00:53,656
only assumed
a real risk.

1777
02:00:53,826 --> 02:00:57,626
The injury to Simon
I had to disable it.

1778
02:00:57,797 --> 02:01:01,824
I'm sorry but for me,
if there was a silly ...

1779
02:01:02,001 --> 02:01:04,970
was silly to have written

1780
02:01:05,137 --> 02:01:07,037
the''J''in the wall of the cabin.

1781
02:01:07,206 --> 02:01:09,231
Something melodramatic
I only had one goal ...

1782
02:01:09,408 --> 02:01:11,035
delete you.

1783
02:01:11,210 --> 02:01:14,646
And who would want to do this except

1784
02:01:14,814 --> 02:01:16,441
an accomplice?

1785
02:01:17,450 --> 02:01:18,747
But after

1786
02:01:18,918 --> 02:01:22,285
the plan began
tangled up,

1787
02:01:22,455 --> 02:01:23,752
is not it?

1788
02:01:24,257 --> 02:01:26,418
Louise Bourget
awake.

1789
02:01:26,726 --> 02:01:29,490
Doyle sees the corer to
the cabin of his wife.

1790
02:01:30,029 --> 02:01:31,929
You hear the clock

1791
02:01:32,431 --> 02:01:34,592
and sees him return to the lobby.

1792
02:01:37,036 --> 02:01:39,402
It offers the silence
for cash

1793
02:01:39,572 --> 02:01:42,871
and in doing so, he signed his own
death sentence.

1794
02:01:43,943 --> 02:01:47,845
Mr. Doyle could not have killed her,
because he could not move.

1795
02:01:48,014 --> 02:01:51,415
I swear it.
And he was right.

1796
02:01:51,584 --> 02:01:53,381
Ms.. Jackie killed her.

1797
02:01:56,489 --> 02:01:57,513
No!

1798
02:01:58,457 --> 02:02:00,789
Yes I am afraid that there is no ambiguity.

1799
02:02:00,960 --> 02:02:04,361
Shortly before dinner
she asked me to see Mr. Doyle.

1800
02:02:04,964 --> 02:02:09,128
Foolishly, I now know that,
I accepted and left them together.

1801
02:02:09,302 --> 02:02:11,827
An apparently
remorseful and distraught ...

1802
02:02:12,004 --> 02:02:13,995
and the other encouraging.

1803
02:02:14,173 --> 02:02:16,334
Simon, I'm so sorry.

1804
02:02:16,509 --> 02:02:17,498
Easy.

1805
02:02:17,677 --> 02:02:19,736
I am sure
that when we leave

1806
02:02:19,912 --> 02:02:22,745
the tone changed.

1807
02:02:22,915 --> 02:02:25,110
All is well, dear.
We almost succeeded.

1808
02:02:25,284 --> 02:02:28,048
Think?
Louise knows.

1809
02:02:28,220 --> 02:02:31,189
She saw me.
Is trying to blackmail us.

1810
02:02:32,892 --> 02:02:34,382
Will have to shut up.

1811
02:02:36,429 --> 02:02:39,125
- We can not pay?
- The whole life?

1812
02:02:40,333 --> 02:02:41,800
Jackie, are you sure?

1813
02:02:52,345 --> 02:02:53,141
Give me some money

1814
02:02:54,480 --> 02:02:55,276
For what?

1815
02:02:55,448 --> 02:02:57,473
That's the hope.
You will be unprepared.

1816
02:02:57,650 --> 02:03:00,118
- Where are you?
- In my coat in the closet.

1817
02:03:17,336 --> 02:03:18,963
- I love you.
- I know.

1818
02:03:19,939 --> 02:03:20,963
Are you crazy?

1819
02:03:21,140 --> 02:03:23,165
Do not know
but we can not stop now.

1820
02:03:25,077 --> 02:03:26,271
Jackie.

1821
02:03:28,481 --> 02:03:29,539
Wish luck.

1822
02:03:42,261 --> 02:03:44,195
Unfortunately,
in their haste

1823
02:03:44,363 --> 02:03:48,026
she forgot a piece of
a thousand-franc note

1824
02:03:48,200 --> 02:03:50,191
between fingers
the dead woman.

1825
02:03:50,569 --> 02:03:52,230
But even more
unfortunately,

1826
02:03:52,405 --> 02:03:55,272
Mrs. Otterbourne
to see out of the box.

1827
02:03:55,908 --> 02:03:57,808
She does not realize

1828
02:03:57,977 --> 02:04:00,036
and back to the cabin
Dr. Bessner

1829
02:04:00,212 --> 02:04:01,975
to return the knife.

1830
02:04:02,682 --> 02:04:07,710
Then, ready for dinner
a little startled and agitated,

1831
02:04:07,887 --> 02:04:10,355
arrives hastily
the restaurant.

1832
02:04:11,190 --> 02:04:12,919
The Sra.Otterbourne,

1833
02:04:13,092 --> 02:04:17,529
when Dr. Bessner account
about the murder of Louise

1834
02:04:17,697 --> 02:04:20,825
realizes that saw
the killer

1835
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:23,400
leaving the scene of the crime.

1836
02:04:23,602 --> 02:04:24,432
What?

1837
02:04:24,603 --> 02:04:26,662
He said he knows who
Louise killed?

1838
02:04:26,839 --> 02:04:28,204
Easy. Do not scream.

1839
02:04:28,407 --> 02:04:31,069
Mrs. Otterbourne, can not
stay here. I forbid

1840
02:04:31,243 --> 02:04:32,938
I found it odd

1841
02:04:33,112 --> 02:04:36,548
Mr. Doyle scream
with Mrs. Otterbourne.

1842
02:04:36,716 --> 02:04:39,947
Now I know who did it
to warn Jackie

1843
02:04:40,119 --> 02:04:41,416
the cabin door.

1844
02:04:41,721 --> 02:04:45,020
Mrs. Otterbourne,
God, calm down.

1845
02:04:45,191 --> 02:04:47,853
Now tell us the story
from the beginning.

1846
02:04:48,027 --> 02:04:52,464
And why, from the beginning
and the whole story?

1847
02:04:52,631 --> 02:04:55,156
To allow time
Jackie's act,

1848
02:04:55,334 --> 02:04:57,234
what he did immediately.

1849
02:04:57,403 --> 02:04:59,200
- ... you have to say
- Mr. Doyle.

1850
02:04:59,371 --> 02:05:01,339
It was he who killed his wife.

1851
02:05:06,645 --> 02:05:07,737
Mr. Pennington?

1852
02:05:20,860 --> 02:05:24,523
Boasted that his father
had taught her to shoot.

1853
02:05:24,697 --> 02:05:26,892
and her pride was not in vain.

1854
02:05:27,066 --> 02:05:28,260
I saw that I knew ...

1855
02:05:30,970 --> 02:05:34,235
He dropped the gun and ran
to his cabin next door.

1856
02:05:34,406 --> 02:05:36,033
It was very risky

1857
02:05:36,208 --> 02:05:39,575
but it was his only chance.

1858
02:05:44,383 --> 02:05:45,941
My friends

1859
02:05:46,118 --> 02:05:47,551
that's all.

1860
02:05:53,993 --> 02:05:56,018
Congratulations, Mr. P.

1861
02:05:56,195 --> 02:06:00,029
-For a fun theory.
It's more than a theory.

1862
02:06:00,900 --> 02:06:02,162
Unfortunately

1863
02:06:02,735 --> 02:06:04,362
is the truth.

1864
02:06:05,638 --> 02:06:08,436
And what happened
with the first bullet?

1865
02:06:08,607 --> 02:06:10,074
What Jackie shot me?

1866
02:06:10,709 --> 02:06:12,267
Good question, yes.

1867
02:06:12,444 --> 02:06:14,173
Everyone is looking at this table?

1868
02:06:14,346 --> 02:06:17,247
It has a piercing bullet
recent here.

1869
02:06:17,416 --> 02:06:20,943
You had time
taking the bullet

1870
02:06:21,120 --> 02:06:22,951
and throws it into the Nile.

1871
02:06:23,122 --> 02:06:25,454
- Nonsense!
- It's not nonsense.

1872
02:06:25,624 --> 02:06:27,854
We have evidence
that the three bullets

1873
02:06:28,027 --> 02:06:30,018
are gun
Miss. Jacqueline.

1874
02:06:30,429 --> 02:06:32,056
Suppose that.

1875
02:06:32,231 --> 02:06:34,426
How to prove that Simon
shot the other two?

1876
02:06:35,134 --> 02:06:36,601
Correct.

1877
02:06:36,769 --> 02:06:38,100
Have no evidence.

1878
02:06:38,270 --> 02:06:40,670
Absolutely
no evidence

1879
02:06:40,840 --> 02:06:43,502
The find, easy.
Not escape.

1880
02:06:43,742 --> 02:06:44,936
No?

1881
02:06:45,144 --> 02:06:47,806
Not convinced
a jury without evidence.

1882
02:06:48,581 --> 02:06:51,379
And where you want
get them, Mr. P.?

1883
02:06:51,550 --> 02:06:52,608
With Linnet?

1884
02:06:53,652 --> 02:06:56,143
No.
Not with Linnet.

1885
02:06:57,957 --> 02:06:58,855
With you.

1886
02:07:00,759 --> 02:07:01,953
What do you mean?

1887
02:07:02,461 --> 02:07:03,587
Simon

1888
02:07:03,963 --> 02:07:05,726
Quietly

1889
02:07:05,898 --> 02:07:07,559
ha a very simple proof,

1890
02:07:07,766 --> 02:07:10,997
now accepted as evidence
in any court in the world.

1891
02:07:11,170 --> 02:07:13,297
It's called''Proof''Moulage.

1892
02:07:14,773 --> 02:07:16,035
Moulage''Proof''?

1893
02:07:16,375 --> 02:07:18,536
Yes,''''Moulage.
When firing a weapon

1894
02:07:19,478 --> 02:07:24,415
skin are grains of gunpowder
that can be drawn

1895
02:07:24,583 --> 02:07:26,847
with a thin layer
wax.

1896
02:07:27,286 --> 02:07:29,345
This is the''Proof''Moulage.

1897
02:07:31,523 --> 02:07:33,889
Sir, can do this?

1898
02:07:34,493 --> 02:07:36,085
Anytime.

1899
02:07:38,030 --> 02:07:41,090
I suppose you are willing
to undergo this test?

1900
02:07:42,101 --> 02:07:44,001
It does not hurt, just feels a little

1901
02:07:45,304 --> 02:07:46,498
heat.

1902
02:07:57,783 --> 02:07:58,875
Jackie, what ...?

1903
02:08:01,020 --> 02:08:02,351
What can we do?

1904
02:08:10,062 --> 02:08:12,257
Nothing.

1905
02:08:12,431 --> 02:08:13,295
It's all over.

1906
02:08:22,074 --> 02:08:24,269
Do not worry so much, sir

1907
02:08:24,443 --> 02:08:26,570
for me, I mean.

1908
02:08:26,745 --> 02:08:28,679
Is concerned, is not it?
A little?

1909
02:08:30,049 --> 02:08:31,209
Yes

1910
02:08:31,984 --> 02:08:33,975
And do not judge Simon
too hard.

1911
02:08:34,153 --> 02:08:36,781
Never had the money and Linnet

1912
02:08:36,956 --> 02:08:39,186
dazzled with all the
their wealth.

1913
02:08:39,758 --> 02:08:43,285
Simon,
remember what you said?

1914
02:08:43,762 --> 02:08:45,354
He said it was''a story

1915
02:08:45,531 --> 02:08:48,398
I would marry the Linnet,
she would die and I would inherit everything.''

1916
02:08:49,268 --> 02:08:51,896
That's when I knew
who conceived the idea.

1917
02:08:52,071 --> 02:08:54,301
Terrorized me.
He knew that try something

1918
02:08:54,473 --> 02:08:55,770
totally absurd.

1919
02:08:55,941 --> 02:08:58,239
Even had the idea for
the snake in his bed.

1920
02:08:59,678 --> 02:09:02,977
And you found another use
for the snake lady.

1921
02:09:05,551 --> 02:09:07,416
Glad
not to have him killed, sir.

1922
02:09:08,887 --> 02:09:10,286
Honestly.

1923
02:09:13,125 --> 02:09:14,023
So

1924
02:09:15,494 --> 02:09:17,758
you see,

1925
02:09:17,930 --> 02:09:19,761
had to help you.

1926
02:09:21,600 --> 02:09:23,534
I always had to help you.

1927
02:09:25,304 --> 02:09:26,771
Jackie, I love you.

1928
02:09:27,906 --> 02:09:29,066
I love you.

1929
02:09:36,448 --> 02:09:37,779
Stop!

1930
02:09:42,021 --> 02:09:43,215
Mr Poirot.

1931
02:09:56,435 --> 02:09:58,062
What a tragedy!

1932
02:10:13,452 --> 02:10:16,216
A splendid work,
Poirot, I must admit.

1933
02:10:16,388 --> 02:10:19,880
Could not have done
the''test''Montage.

1934
02:10:20,059 --> 02:10:21,492
I have no wax.

1935
02:10:21,660 --> 02:10:25,357
Haunts me, sir.
Haunts me altogether.

1936
02:10:28,367 --> 02:10:30,597
Goodbye, Mr. Poirot.

1937
02:10:30,769 --> 02:10:33,795
I fear that the description
their cases should expect

1938
02:10:33,972 --> 02:10:35,337
until another opportunity.

1939
02:10:35,507 --> 02:10:36,940
Alas, lady!

1940
02:10:37,109 --> 02:10:40,306
I wanted to tell you
My recent experience

1941
02:10:40,479 --> 02:10:42,470
on the Orient Express.

1942
02:10:43,082 --> 02:10:44,913
Come, Bowers.
It's time to go.

1943
02:10:45,417 --> 02:10:49,820
This place gets
to resemble a morgue.

1944
02:10:49,988 --> 02:10:52,923
Thank God
will be one soon.

1945
02:10:53,092 --> 02:10:55,424
- Old boring.
- What genius, Bowers!

1946
02:10:55,594 --> 02:10:58,119
Need a vacation
refreshing.

1947
02:10:58,297 --> 02:11:02,358
I thought of a trip
the Gobi Desert.

1948
02:11:05,804 --> 02:11:08,500
Mr. Poirot, I want it
the first to know.

1949
02:11:08,674 --> 02:11:10,471
We just became engaged.

1950
02:11:10,642 --> 02:11:13,167
Congratulations, Missy.

1951
02:11:13,345 --> 02:11:14,175
Lord.

1952
02:11:14,346 --> 02:11:16,644
- Congratulations and good luck.
- Thanks.

1953
02:11:16,982 --> 02:11:18,609
- Goodbye, Mr. Poirot.
- Goodbye, sir.

1954
02:11:18,784 --> 02:11:20,581
- Colonel Race.
- Good luck.

1955
02:11:23,522 --> 02:11:24,318
My young,

1956
02:11:25,224 --> 02:11:26,657
an advice ...

1957
02:11:26,825 --> 02:11:28,793
