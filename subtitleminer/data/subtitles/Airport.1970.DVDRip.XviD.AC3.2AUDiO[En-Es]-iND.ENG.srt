Yeah. We just lost runway two-niner.

A tail sticking out
into the runway about 20 yards.

I don't know.
It could be a long time.

I just found something.

runway two-niner.

Oh, no. Snow?

34

One of your jockeys missed
a turn-off, buried the wheel.

- Any casualties?
- Just me.

38
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,671
There's bound to be a passenger
with a $50 wrenched back.

39

white phone. Urgent.'

43
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,236
- Bakersfeld.
- Where the hell are you?

44
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,709
I'm on my way to the field.
An emergency.

45
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,990
You said you would
be home at 6:00.

46
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,715
You promised not to miss this dinner.
You promised that a week ago.

47
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,395
A week ago I didn't know we'd have
the worst storm in six years.

48
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,955
- You've always got some damn excuse.
- I'll call you back.

49
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,117
Let me take that for you, ma'am.

50
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,152
You'll be much warmer in the bus.
I'm sorry this happened.

51
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,270
The captain wants to take off weight

52
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,437
then hook onto the nose gear
and tow it out with a tractor.

53
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,677
Buried like that, the nose gear
would never stand the strain.

54
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,119
That's what I told him.

55
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,594
I think we should use bags
to lift the wings.

56
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:25,110
- Could take most of tomorrow.
- I want that runway cleared tonight.

57
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,309
Tonight?

58
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,112
I know you're doing all you can,

59
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,596
but if I can con TWA into
giving us Patroni, will you object?

60
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,108
No. Joe can have
all the tries he wants.

61
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,151
- Mr Bakersfeld!
- Yes?

62
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,679
Snow desk.

63
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,309
Yes, Danny?

64
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,954
I'm calling Patroni.
Stand by on mobile phone.

65
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,797
Roger.

66
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,354
- Hello, Joe?
- Hi, Mel. Save your breath.

67
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,278
Danny gave me the poop.
Tonight I'm not available.

68
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:09,154
Joe, I need you. I got 14 on the
ground and 18 stacked upstairs.

69
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,873
And I've got our five kids
stacked away at mother's

70
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,512
so me and Marie could be alone.

71
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:17,155
Tell Marie I'm sorry to louse up
her evening. I need two-niner badly.

72
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,918
Can't the Global crew handle it?

73
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,633
They're having a conference
to decide what to do.

74
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,831
But I need somebody who knows,
a genius, like Patroni.

75
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,714
Hold the whipped cream.
I've just had dessert.

76
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,228
- All right. I'll be there.
- Good.

77
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,430
In the meantime,
give everybody a shovel

78
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,313
and dig a ten-degree incline
in front of the wheels.

79
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,749
- Right.
- Out.

80
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,475
Ah, Joe. Do you have to go to work
on a night like this?

81
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:46,752
They don't call them emergencies
any more. They call them "Patronis".

82
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,950
I suppose you'll be late, huh?

83
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,073
I'll be back in time if I have
to pull that plane out with my teeth.

84
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,236
What's this I should know about?

85
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:04,989
Your brother-in-law was on
the snow clearance committee today.

86
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,393
My boss got the report.

87
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,874
I can guess what it says.
"The airport" - me -

88
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:12,276
- "is inefficient in snow..."
- "Grossly inefficient."

89
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,710
"...causing flight delays,
loss of revenue to airlines, etc."

90
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,150
"Signed, Captain Demerest, chairman."
How can he say this?

91
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,352
Because he's a louse who can't pass
up the opportunity to knife me.

92
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,198
'Mobile One,
Snow Desk. Where are you? '

93
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,673
Coming up to the ramp.

94
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,269
Mel, Commissioner Ackerman
wants you at the terminal.

95
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,958
- Trouble.
- 'I'm on my way.'

96
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,151
Close down runway 22.

97
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,516
Close down runway 22.

98
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,354
Keep moving, please.
Keep moving, please.

99
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,035
'Mr Harold Brotten,
please come to the information desk.'

100
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:51,039
They'll break it up soon and go home
after the TV cameras get a few shots.

101
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,149
TV?

102
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,794
Their new lawyer
arranged for news coverage.

103
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:58,753
That's all we need. I'd better
tell the other commissioners.

104
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,030
Afterwards we'll meet
in the boardroom

105
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,799
and see what we can do
to calm those people down.

106
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,235
I'll call you.

107
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,236
Mel.

108
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:11,636
Hi, sis. I thought Vernon
was on flight two tonight.

109
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,035
He is.

110
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:18,675
- Sure are here early.
- What with the weather and traffic,

111
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,157
Vernon didn't want to chance being
late, but we just sailed right along.

112
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:28,673
I thought they were pilots picketing
you. I was all set to join them.

113
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,551
I heard about your report.

114
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,479
Besides everything else, now you're
an authority on snow clearance?

115
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:37,990
- I call them as I see them.
- Then you're due for an eye check.

116
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,713
For your information,
clearing those runways

117
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,718
is the equivalent of 700 miles
of two-lane highway.

118
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,072
Well, what do you know? I'll bet you
measured every foot of it yourself.

119
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,759
We've had ten inches
of snow in the last 24 hours.

120
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,189
Anchorage had twice that
and they're clean.

121
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,037
They've got twice the equipment.

122
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,548
- Then get some more.
- This isn't Alaska.

123
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,990
You don't spend two million dollars
for machinery you hardly use.

124
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,634
You buy for average snowfall.
In emergencies,

125
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,477
you work round the clock.

126
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,796
Sitting behind that desk
made you think like a bookkeeper.

127
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,637
I didn't always fly a desk.

128
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:14,673
All right, Daddy. Now you tell me
all about when you were a war hero.

129
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,792
You flew those pursuit jobs
you could land in a parking lot.

130
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:21,355
When I'm setting down
over 200,000 pounds of 707,

131
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:25,313
I want something under my wheels
that's plenty long and mighty dry.

132
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,239
It'll be dry tonight,
but not too long. 2-9 is closed.

133
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:32,795
The pilot from your flight 45
made a short cut across the field.

134
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,957
- And he didn't make it.
- But what are you doing about it?

135
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,958
Well, when the snow melts
in April, we'll get it out.

136
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,514
What the hell do you think
I'm doing about it?

137
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,993
Stop that, both of you!

138
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,998
Yeah. It's a waste of time
arguing with a penguin.

139
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,395
- Bye.
- Have a good flight, dear.

140
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,590
What would you like from Rome?

141
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:55,435
Just yourself. Maybe if you have the
time, I could use some white gloves.

142
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,397
Size six and a half, right?

143
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,109
No. I'm the one
who wears a size seven and a half.

144
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:06,234
'American Airlines,
flight 103 for St Louis

145
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,271

146
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,472
Hey, that's a good idea, Mel -
using little old ladies for skycaps.

147
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:15,193
You keep that up.
You're doing a good job.

148

juvenile delinquent I'll never know.

00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,078
There's just us.
If I left him, what would I have?

152
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,953
Would you have any more
if he decided to leave you?

153
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,195
He won't. When a girl gets serious,

154
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,674
he waves his wedding ring
like a flag.

155
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,190
- I'm his disaster insurance.
- More like group insurance.

156
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,390
Thanks for caring, Mel. Don't worry.

157
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,159
Someday he'll come home
for some other reason

158
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,236
than to just change his clothes.

159
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:52,033
Well, I hope so.

160
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,031
That's for me. Goodbye, dear.

161
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,958
Bakersfeld.

162
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,356
No, no.
No, I'll take care of it myself.

163
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,990
Vern! We just don't have time.

164
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,430
I have a cab waiting, we
can make the airport in 15 minutes.

165
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,677
The driver will wait.
His meter's running and so is mine.

166
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,598
- But I must pack.
- If you get me up to full throttle

167
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,518
then throw me into reverse,
you could damage my engine.

168
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,870
Look, we'll be in Rome tomorrow.
We'll have three days.

169
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,515
- Try a little patience.
- Or a cold shower.

170
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,437
Think about something else.

171
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,392
That I like.
You can see right through it.

172
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,079
- Who's in the right-hand seat?
- I am.

173
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,588
- Demoted?
- No. It's a pilot-check flight.

174
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:20,155
- I'm checking Anson Harris.
- He's been a captain for years.

175
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,909
So have I, but somebody's gotta check
you out every six months

176
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,394
to make sure
you don't pick up bad habits.

177
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,750
Such as nuzzling stewardesses?

178
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,678
Does he hold onto
the control too firmly?

179
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,196
Or can he sort of coax them
along with just his fingers?

180
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,713
- But we still have to...
- Go and wash it.

181
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,589
When he can't get clearance to land,
how does he take it?

182
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:50,713
He controls his emotions and says,
"Better luck next time."

183
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,990
"Better luck next time."

184
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,238
You and your roommate
have enough china,

185
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:13,158
glasses and booze
for a round trip to Australia.

186
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,829
That's not all ours. The giris
in the building contributed.

187
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,599
Grace is getting married.
We're having a party.

188
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:23,076
If you could hijack a 707,
you could start your own airline.

189
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,271
We thought of that.
But none of us has a pilot's licence.

190
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,359
Well, with the kind of fringe
benefits you giris have to offer,

191
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,709
I could get you a crew right now.

192
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,832
Mel? Joe.

193
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,509
I'm stuck in traffic on Cariton Road
just east of Mannheim.

194
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,358
A tractor trailer
jack-knifed and flipped over.

195
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,675
It's on its side
like a drunken dinosaur.

196
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,950
Joe, I need two-niner awful bad.

197
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,436
If you're not out soon, I'll get
highway patrol to bring you in.

198
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,153
What else can go wrong?

199
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,192
I'll check the snow desk.
I'll be back for his call.

200
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,755
You're not going. You've
been rushing around for three days.

201
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,553
- I've gotta get up there.
- Why do it all yourself?

202
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,795
You've got an assistant.
Let Mike do it.

203
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:23,833
Sit down and relax. I'll fix you
some coffee and a sandwich.

204
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,188
Oh. One thing you should do.

205
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,152
You promised to call your wife back.

206
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,355
Bakersfeld residence, Libby speaking.

207
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,837
- This is Mr Bakersfeld talking.
- Daddy! Isn't the snow super?

208
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,829
- Baby, it's cool, real cool.
- Robbie, Daddy's on the phone.

209
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,111
- Hello, Dad.
- Hi, Robbie.

210
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,151
Are you coming home tonight?

211
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,270
At the moment,
honey, I'm not so sure...

212
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,158
Say good night, giris.
Mommy wants to talk to Daddy.

213
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,749
- Good night, Daddy.
- Good night, Dad.

214
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,756
You hung up on me before.
Don't ever do that again.

215
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,519
I'm sorry,
but I was rushing onto the field.

216
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,869
All right.
We don't have time to argue.

217
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,718
You have a dinner jacket there.
Meet me at the hotel.

218
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,990
I told you, we've got an emergency.

219
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,474
I have to stay here,
probably all night.

220
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,272
You can't.

221
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,949
- You can't keep doing this to me.
- Listen to me, Cindy.

222
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,675
Last month you scheduled me
for seven charity wingdings.

223
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,837
'I've made four -
a good batting average.'

224
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,519
'I'm not a ball game.
I'm your wife.'

225
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,836
'Then try to remember it
and think of my position.'

226
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,189
'I'm only thinking about you.

227
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,755
'This isn't just any dinner.
Dad wants to talk to you.'

228
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:05,395
'He's been talking for 15 years and
I've been saying no for 15 years.'

229
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,036
- 'It's a wonderful opportunity.'
- 'I thought you'd got the message.

230
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,834
'I'm not interested in his job.
I've been in aviation 20 years.

231
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:17,031
'It's what I'm trained for,
I like it and it's my life.'

232
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:20,595
'What kind of a life?
This'd give you regular hours.

233
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,359
'We could be together
and with our children.

234
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:28,315
- 'And your income would triple.'
- 'We can join the country club'

235
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:32,194
- 'What's wrong with that? '
- 'Let's get something straight.

236
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,471
'I'll support my family my way
on the income from my job.'

237
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,512
'You don't give a damn
about our future.'

238
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,592
At the moment,
I'm trying to survive the present.

239
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,950
- Maybe you won't have to.
- What the hell does that mean?

240
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,877
You figure it out.

241
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,795
Why don't you have your coffee
in here and lie down for a minute?

242
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:12,073
Hey, guess what. Miller says they
just picked up a stowaway from LA.

243
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,111
That's four this month.

244
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,993
BOAC had one on Monday,
a 16-year-old.

245
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,998
If you're wondering if we had
another fight, no.

246
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:23,032
Just a continuation of the same one.

247
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,596
I'm just as much to blame as she is.

248
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:31,031
She's right.
I look for excuses not to go home.

249
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:37,356
Hello, Joe? Oh, Harry.

250
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,391
Yes, all right.
I'll be right there.

251
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,752
- Two of you get on the nose wheel.
- How deep should we go?

252
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,757
If we're gonna do it this way,
we need a lot more men.

253
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,155
All right. I'll try
to round up some for you.

254
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,556
Maybe there's an easier way.
Captain Demerest has a good idea.

255
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,750
Captain!

256
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,633
Why don't you tell Mr Bakersfeld?

257
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:10,309
I've got an idea that will make
you Aviation Man of the Year

258
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,749
and Captain Benson agrees with me.

259
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:16,031
We put pneumatic jacks under
the jacking plates and lift her.

260
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,914
When she's high enough just fill in,
plank over and roll her on the flat.

261
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,833
If every jack isn't absolutely level,
she'll slide off

262
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,633
and you'll have a hole
in the wing and the fuel tank.

263
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,672
- I'll stick with Patroni.
- OK, do it the hard way,

264
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:33,231
- but I'm not taking off on 2-2.
- You'll use what's available.

265
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,840
If it's 2-2,
I'm not using noise abatement

266
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,633
or cutting back
on power over those houses.

267
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:43,310
So unless you want a bill for broken
dishes, you better move this thing.

268
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,117
Keep digging.

269
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:51,312
If another pilot comes up with
an idea like that, hand him a shovel.

270
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,430
Yes, Peter?

271
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:59,758
Uh, Mrs Livingston, I've got that
stowaway Mr Miller told you about.

272
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,871
Bring him in.

273
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:10,558
Hello. I'm Mrs Ada Quonsett.

274
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:14,639
I'm Mrs Livingston, pleased to...
I mean, won't you sit down.

275
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:18,355
Oh, thank you, my dear.
It was a long walk from that gate.

276
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,152
We've got some talking to do.
I think you better lock that door.

277
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:30,113
- I see you've done this before.
- Oh, yes, my dear.

278
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,390
But it's against the law.
Why do you do it?

279
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:35,876
Well, I'm a widow and I have
a married daughter in New York.

280
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,673
Sometimes I miss her
and the grandchildren.

281
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,790
So I go down to the airport
in Los Ángeles

282
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,274
and get on a plane
that's going to New York.

283
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,232
And then when I'm ready
to go home it's vice versa.

284
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:50,114
- Just like that, without a ticket?
- I couldn't afford a ticket.

285
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,151
I just have my social security

286
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,397
and the small pensión
that my late husband left me.

287
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,510
Have you done this on other airlines?

288
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:01,394
Oh, yes. But I like
Trans Global the best.

289
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,910
Well, it's nice to meet
a satisfied customer.

290
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,470
- How about Patroni?
- Highway patrol's bringing him in.

291
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,829
- When will he be here?
- About half an hour.

292
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,030
Good. Now I'll have that sandwich.

293
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,435
I'm starving.
I haven't eaten since...

294
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,277
Oh, I'm sorry.

295
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,511
No, don't go away.
I'd like you to meet Mrs Quonsett,

296
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,994
the stowaway I was
talking about before.

297
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:29,158
This is Mr Bakersfeld,
general manager of the airport.

298
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,077
Well, how do you do?

299
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,918
It's a pleasure to meet
someone so important.

300
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:37,953
- Pleased to meet you, ma'am.
- Don't go. Come sit with us.

301
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,560
Have a cup of coffee
and a sandwich.

302
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,672
Perhaps Mr Bakersfeld
could impress upon Mrs Quonsett

303
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:46,154
that this isn't
a very nice thing to do.

304
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,158
Mrs Livingston hasn't been able to.

305
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,235
Yes, uh, Mrs Quonsett.

306
00:23:56,280 --> 00:24:00,796
Uh, what you've done is dishonest.

307
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,673
You've broken the law.

308
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,790
You've defrauded Trans Global.

309
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,150
Don't you realise
they can prosecute you?

310
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:14,069
But they wouldn't.
It wouldn't be good public relations

311
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:18,750
to prosecute an old lady because
she wanted to visit her daughter.

312
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,230
- May I have one?
- Sure.

313
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:27,750
I didn't eat much on the plane.
The beef was a little too well-done.

314
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,950
And the salad dressing
had garlic in it.

315
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,514
I think you should tell them,
my dear,

316
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:36,075
that very often elderly people
can't tolerate garlic.

317
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,190
It gives them gas.

318
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,756
Well, I'll certainly mention it
to our chef. Thank you.

319
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,711
Oh, not at all.

320
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:49,157
Look, since you've had so much
free travel from Trans Global,

321
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,317
the least you could do is tell us
how you get aboard.

322
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,476
Well, my dear, I use many methods.

323
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:58,957
But mostly, I'm in the airport early
enough to get a boarding pass.

324
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,275
But they're ticket folders.

325
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:04,949
Yes, I know. I go to a counter
and I tell them I've lost mine

326
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,956
and may I please have another one?

327
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,470
I always pick a busy counter
where people are waiting.

328
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,909
They always give me one.

329
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,589
But it's just a blank folder.
It isn't made out as a gate pass.

330
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:21,794
I do that myself in the ladies' room.
I know from experience what to write.

331
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:25,913
I carry a big black pencil like
the airlines use in my purse. See?

332
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,872
Yes, I do.
I'll keep that, if you don't mind.

333
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:33,357
Well, it's really mine.
But I suppose I can get another one.

334
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:37,029
So now you have a boarding pass,
Mrs Quonsett. What then?

335
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,275
Then I go to the departure gate.

336
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,912
- Coffee?
- No, thank you.

337
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:45,351
I wait till the man checking tickets
is busy, then I walk onto the plane.

338
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:48,039
You hear that, Mr Coakley?

339
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,514
No one stops you,
not even the stewardesses?

340
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,551
If you get on late enough,

341
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,592
they're hanging up coats
and talking to the men.

342
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:59,394
I just show them my folder,
quickly, you see.

343
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,231
I'll keep that, too.

344
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:05,352
But I'm sure you don't
always use a boarding pass.

345
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,992
No.

346
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:11,158
Sometimes I tell them my son has gone
aboard, but he dropped his wallet.

347
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,875
I carry a man's wallet in my hand.

348
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,191
That works best of all.

349
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,552
I must say, Mrs Quonsett,
you have everything figured out.

350
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,114
My late husband
taught me to be thorough.

351
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,196
He was a teacher of geometry.

352
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,232
He always said,
"You must consider every angle."

353
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:34,877
My late husband was a lawyer,
and he always said,

354
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:40,074
"Watch out for sweet-looking old
ladies." Now I see what he meant.

355
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,680
So you're a widow, too.
I'm sorry, my dear.

356
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,439
But you're young
and attractive, I'm sure...

357
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:49,393
Let's confine the conversation
to you, Mrs Quonsett.

358
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,238
We're sending you back
to LA on the next flight.

359
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,919
Yes, my dear, I was afraid of that.

360
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,952
Well, I would like
a cup of tea first.

361
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,037
So I'll go, and you can
tell me when you want me back.

362
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,878
Oh, no.
You're not going anywhere alone.

363
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,911
Mrs Quonsett will be on flight 103,

364
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,520
and stick with her every second
until departure.

365
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:12,075
- Don't let her out of your sight.
- Yes. She'll need a ticket.

366
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:15,954
Yes, that will be a change, won't it?
I'll make out an order.

367
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,993
- May I please have my tea now?
- Yes. Where are you going?

368
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,031
Can I have it in
the Commander's Club?

369
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,356
- That's for members only.
- But I have a card.

370
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,869
This card says "Mrs Henry Jackson."

371
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:33,639
Yes, Gertrude lets
me use it when I'm travelling.

372
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:37,832
Well, we'll send it back to Gertrude
with a very strong letter.

373
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:40,110
We'll go this way, Mrs Quonsett.

374
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,919
Goodbye.

375
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,394
Goodbye, ma'am.

376
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:49,955
You've been very nice. Thank you.

377
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,629
I don't believe it.
I just don't believe it.

378
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:02,831
And you were a big help,
giving her that VIP treatment.

379
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,839
Courtesy, sandwiches. I'm surprised
you didn't break open the champagne.

380
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,031
If we had some, I would have.
She deserves it. She's fabulous.

381
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,719
- She sat there laughing at us.
- Take it easy.

382
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:16,435
There've been stowaways since
the Egyptians sailed the Red Sea.

383
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,438
When they caught 'em,
they tossed 'em overboard.

384
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,948
Airlines won't do a thing
and she knows it.

385
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,673
- Crafty little old biddy.
- Oh, come on. Relax.

386
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,314
After all, she only stole
a ride, not a plane.

387
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,351
I know, but...

388
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:36,189
Mel, they've been pressuring me
about that transfer to San Francisco.

389
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,231
I think I'll take it.

390
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:42,319
The pay is better and the change
of climate will do me good.

391
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:45,113
- No snow.
- Yes.

392
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,034
It's a beautiful city. I'll miss you.

393
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,878
Will you, enough not to let me go?

394
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,110
I'm sorry.
I had no right to say that.

395
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:59,392
You've been honest with me all along.
No false hopes, no promises.

396
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,193
I'm not as honest as you think.

397
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:06,193
I said I invented excuses
not to go home. That's true.

398
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:10,512
But I didn't mention the real reason
I needed to stay here.

399
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:17,032
I tell myself I've got to try
to hold things together...

400
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,640
for the sake of the children.

401
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:22,433
But I'm not sure
that's true or even kind.

402
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:28,072
They know what's going on and it's
hurting them, especially Roberta.

403
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:31,032
Then I think about
my mother and father.

404
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:34,755
God knows they had
their ups and downs.

405
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:38,554
But somehow they...
somehow they worked it out.

406
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:42,912
I feel I ought to be able to do
the same or else I've failed.

407
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,996
And I don't like to fail.

408
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,550
I don't know what to do about it.

409
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,074
Maybe you love your wife
more than you realise.

410
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:59,193
No, no. Not for a long time now.

411
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:02,357
The only thing we've got left
in common is an address.

412
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,835
I'm not pressing you, Mel.

413
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:10,917
I wouldn't play
that kind of game with you.

414
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,953
But I think I'd better take
that job in San Francisco.

415
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,594
- Mrs Livingston.
- Yes?

416
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,518
Excuse me, but customs just called.

417
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:24,189
The chief would like you to come
down. He says it's important.

418
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,037
All right.

419
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,070
It seems that one of our passengers

420
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:35,556
is demanding to speak to someone
in authority from Trans Global.

421
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,831
Will you explain to this man that
we're not living in the Dark Ages?

422
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:50,590
That nowadays stores in this country
import clothes from France?

423
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,234
If you looked -
Bergdorf-Goodman labels.

424
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,794
Oh, I did look, madam,
rather closely.

425
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:01,517
I find the sewing of the labels isn't
up to Bergdorf's usual standard.

426
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:04,791
They're always
very professional, very neat.

427
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:08,913
As you can see,
that's a pretty sloppy job.

428
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,873
But I suppose everybody's having
trouble getting good help these days.

429
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,036
Especially the customs service.

430
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:23,353
'Will Mr Henry Oliver
come to the cashier's window? '

431
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,709
Well, what's the matter, boy?

432
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,433
Is there something
the matter, huh?

433
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,790
Oh, your collar's too tight.

434
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:35,310
Officer, about the dresses...
Perhaps I did make a mistake.

435
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,319
I did buy them there. And there
are some other things that I...

436
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,551
Sorry, madam.

437
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,958
Check everything else very carefully.

438
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,197
Inspect the linings
of the bags and the cases.

439
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,356
- Make a list.
- Yes, sir.

440
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,797
Sorry, fella.

441
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:10,196
I'd like to change that declaration.
Please, I beg of you.

442
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,118
- My husband will...
- Madam, why don't you sit down?

443
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,037
This might take some time.

444
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,877
When will they learn?

445
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:20,196
The duty would have been
one-tenth of what the fine will be.

446
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,471
You are amazing.
I never would have suspected her.

447
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:26,159
Well, after 30 years,
you kind of know.

448
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,998
First I look in their eyes
and then the luggage.

449
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:33,079
Thanks for coming down.
Now, may I ask you another favour?

450
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,351
If you want me to smuggle
anything in, the answer is no.

451
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:39,073
No. My sister's girl, Judy Barton,

452
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,078
is gonna be on your number two
flight to Rome tonight.

453
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,759
- Can you get her a window seat?
- I'm sure of it.

454
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,392
Good.

455
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:49,079
- Oh, Mrs Livingston.
- Yes?

456
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,509
With this weather,
will it get off on time?

457
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:55,348
Flight two, the Golden Argosy,
will depart for Rome on schedule.

458
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,437
Good. Fine. Thank you.

459
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:24,558
I thought you said
you were leaving tomorrow.

460
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,830
No. I said I start work tomorrow.

461
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,599
I gotta be in Milwaukee tonight.
Remember?

462
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:32,393
It's not another of those
"hello, goodbye" jobs?

463
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:37,195
I talked to Mr Williams himself -
175 a week.

464
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,708
Look, this is a 30-storey building.

465
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,513
The job will last eight months
at least.

466
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,630
I hope so.

467
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:51,478
Do me one favour. If your boss says
two and two is six, agree with him.

468
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:55,069
Whatever way he wants to do anything,

469
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:57,554
- that's my way.
- Don't lose your temper.

470
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:02,310
And Williams said after Milwaukee,
there's a building in Detroit

471
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,676
and they may even subcontract
the excavating to me.

472
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,751
Be satisfied you're working.

473
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,837
I am, but... You'll see.
Everything will be fine.

474
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,269
It's gonna be the way it used to be.

475
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:17,836
Nothing's the way it used to be.
But I'm not complaining.

476
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,474
You never do.
How you could stick with me...

477
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:24,593
"For better or for worse."
I meant what I said.

478
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,074
It's gonna be better again.
I promise.

479
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:31,398
I've got an idea. The kids won't have
to live with your sister any more,

480
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,750
and you're gonna have money
and a nice home and clothes...

481
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,199
Stop.

482
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,117
Stop dreaming.

483
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,316
Just hold on to the job.

484
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,676
I'll do it right this time.
I won't mess it up.

485
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,516
How you gonna get to Milwaukee?

486
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,279
The bus that leaves
in just a few minutes.

487
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,351
I've got enough for that

488
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,870
and then I can draw an advance
on my salary tomorrow.

489
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:08,074
But I will need something for a hotel
room tonight, if you could just...

490
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:12,312
All I've got is enough
to put something on the rent.

491
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:15,238
- All right.
- Dom.

492
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,198
The silverware is gone.
My watch is gone.

493
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:24,232
My mother's ring. Don't pawn that.

494
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,717
Here. I'll give the landlord
a hard-luck story.

495
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,871
Goodbye, Dom.

496
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,671
Inez.

497
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:51,715
I haven't been a very good provider,
but I will be. I promise you that.

498
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,756
Goodbye, Inez.

499
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,758
I love you. I want you
to always remember that.

500
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,351
Bye.

501
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,439
- Two dollars.
- It's highway robbery.

502
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:47,553
Why the airlines don't provide
free transportation, I'll never know.

503
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,875
I don't own the bus. I just drive it.

504
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,912
- You're holding up the line.
- Here, here.

505
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,512
Hi, Anson.
What are you doing here so early?

506
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,596
Trying to impress your check pilot?

507
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:18,195
I thought I'd get an "A" for effort.
No, we're using 324 tonight.

508
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:21,113
On her last flight,
number two engine had trouble,

509
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:23,674
and I wanted to see
what maintenance did.

510
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,711
I hope they gave us a new one.

511
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,797
They even replaced all the wiring,
just to be safe.

512
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:32,674
- That's the side I like to be on.
- What's the matter?

513
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,439
I was thinking about
the last time you checked me out.

514
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,313
You marked me down for not
wearing a regulation shirt.

515
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,635
- I was hoping to get even.
- Not a chance.

516
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:44,912
Knowing how tough you can be,
tonight I even polished my wings.

517
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,397
Thanks, fellas.

518
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,671
Tried to get you more help
but no luck. I've only got 20 men.

519
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,712
I knew you'd blow it,
so I phoned from my car.

520
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,955
- I got 50.
- Where'd you get them from?

521
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,991
Braniff, Delta, Continental.

522
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:07,157
We're not like the stiffs
in the office who wear ties

523
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,350
and steal each other's passengers.

524
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,391
Maintenance is like a circus.

525
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,671
One of us is in trouble,
he yells and they all come running.

526
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,917
Let's move. I got a beautiful
dame waiting for me at home.

527
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:36,712
We should be above this in about
20 minutes or so. Let's hope.

528
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:41,590
- Did you forget something?
- Just checking the Rome weather.

529
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,437
Not too cold and sunny.

530
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,789
As usual,
I brought the wrong clothes.

531
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:49,116
- I don't have a thing to wear.
- Great!

532
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:55,875
I'll have this mother out of here
by midnight. So stop worrying.

533
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,229
In that case,
the party starts at 12:01.

534
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:01,113
I'll settle for a box of cigars.
See you later.

535
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:08,398
If you keep leaning on that shovel,
you'll freeze solid like Lot's wife.

536
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:11,716
We wanna move this aeroplane
before it becomes obsolete.

537
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,035
The way you guys
keep heading for this bus

538
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,799
looks like you got a broad
stashed in there.

539
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,831
Out! Everybody, out!

540
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,071
'Attention please,
ladies and gentlemen.

541
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,759
'Trans Global Airlines
regrets to announce

542
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:35,190
that flight two to Rome
will not depart until 11pm.'

543
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:40,229
'We are sorry, but this is due
to the condition of the highways,

544
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:44,114
'which is causing unavoidable delays
to ground transportation.'

545
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,754
So those of you on flight two
to Rome, don't worry.

546
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:50,395
They're holding the plane. Just
relax. I'll get you there in time.

547
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,755
They could've decided before we left.

548
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,439
Making us sit and worry.
It's inexcusable.

549
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,789
Go away. Your nose is running.

550
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:01,992
Paolo, vieni qui.
Vieni qui, Paulo.

551
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:08,198
'Will all passengers
holding tickets

552
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:11,516
'for Continental flight 221 to Denver

553
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:14,028
'please report to the ticket counter

00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,435
'to arrange for

555
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,789
Of course,
if it's not crowded, I...

556
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:23,709
Here's the ticket. It's flight 103.

557
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,433
- Oh, thank you.
- Oh, no, you don't.

558
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,949
My, she has a suspicious nature.

559
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,437
Go on. You were saying you preferred
the flights that aren't direct, huh?

560
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,677
Yes. That's why your flight 86
is my favourite.

561
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:42,154
St Louis, Kansas City, Chicago.

562
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:45,431
But don't they check you
at all the intermediate stops?!

563
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:48,631
I pretend to be asleep.
Usually, they don't disturb me.

564
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:52,798
- But this time they caught you.
- It was that man sitting next to me.

565
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:57,356
I confided in him and he
betrayed me to the stewardess.

566
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:00,392
He was a policeman from San Diego.

567
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:04,115
I think they should make them
always wear their uniforms.

568
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,628
Otherwise, how's a person to know?

569
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:12,319
Hi, Mel. I was just
gonna have you paged.

570
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,920
- I was in the field.
- We got trouble, Mel.

571
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,713
I talked to the lawyer
for the Meadowood people.

572
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:21,275
Unless we stop planes taking off
over their houses by midnight,

573
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:26,075
he's starting a damage suit first
thing in the morning for $10 million.

574
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:29,430
That's a nice round figure.
But he hasn't got a prayer.

575
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,277
He might not win, but he can sue.

576
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:35,393
Any legal action will make public
relations worse than they are now.

577
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:39,956
And that's something we commissioners
don't want to risk.

578
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,356
- What do you propose to do about it?
- There's only one answer.

579
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:46,039
Shut it down and cut out the noise
over Meadowood.

580
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:50,312
- That means closing down completely.
- Only until morning.

581
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:54,239
After all, you promised them you
wouldn't disturb their sleep.

582
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:57,477
I promised them we wouldn't
unless there was an emergency.

583
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,351
And I promised something else.

584
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:02,676
In the foreseeable future,
the noise won't get any better.

585
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:05,598
Well, if you don't want to spend
months in court,

586
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,710
you better start conning them.

587
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,751
You think lying is the answer?

588
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:12,519
- Ah, Mel.
- There's your answer.

589
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,755
A modern, expanded airport.

590
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:18,554
Big and efficient enough to take
anything the designers throw at us.

591
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:21,637
That means buying up Meadowood
for industrial use

592
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,671
so the noise won't matter.

593
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:26,678
I didn't come here to talk
about the future of aviation.

594
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:29,792
You better start.
And you better start looking ahead.

595
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:33,549
What are we going to do about these
jumbos that seat 500 passengers?

596
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:36,034
How are we going to get
people to the airport?

597
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:39,072
Save that for the women's clubs
and Rotary luncheons.

598
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:41,918
- We've got to be practical.
- Sure, ignore it.

599
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:43,951
Don't stick your neck out.

600
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,197
It's time that you all
began fighting for a bond issue

601
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:49,231
to finance this kind of airport

602
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:52,829
instead of running around
checking to see if the toilets flush.

603
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,873
Insulting me won't solve anything,
so let's get back to the problem.

604
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:59,229
We've got to make
a decisión about tonight.

605
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,590
- The airport's staying open.
- Stop being bull-headed.

606
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,996
- Think of the consequences.
- Don't tell me about consequences.

607
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:08,508
When Congress voted to cut
airport funds,

608
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:11,074
you never even sent in
a letter of protest.

609
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:13,509
Where were you
when the airlines and pilots

610
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:16,757
were pleading for more airports
and better traffic control?

611
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,394
You were picking colours
in the ladies' lounge.

612
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,318
You've got your consequences.
Congested air traffic,

613
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:25,955
where Sunday pilots hold up airliners
with thousands of people

614
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,470
and force us to stack up planes
as far away as Denver.

615
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,795
When it comes to politics,
you're a child.

616
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:34,274
Two of our councilmen
live in Meadowood.

617
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,311
Think what they'll do to us downtown.

618
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:39,272
I'm thinking of those pilots
waiting to land,

619
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:42,756
flying blind in that muck
and circling in holding patterns

620
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,872
praying to God some overworked,
underpaid controller

621
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:48,354
doesn't have another plane
on the same course.

622
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:51,198
Call it pigheaded.
Call it what you want.

623
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:55,153
But as long as we're not below FAA
minimums, we're not closing down.

624
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,714
All right,
if that's the way you want it.

625
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,751
I'm calling the commissioners

626
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:02,758
and I'll let you know
what OUR decisión is in an hour.

627
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,951
That's your privilege.
You've got the right to fire me.

628
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,197
But until you do,
this airport is staying open.

629
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,836
Do you wish to make a reservation?

630
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,075
No, I don't.
Could you please tell me

631
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:01,350
if there's a flight to Rome tonight?

632
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:04,836
Yes. Our Golden Argosy, flight two.
It departs at 10pm,

633
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:08,156
only it's delayed one hour
due to weather conditions.

634
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:13,115
Could you... I must find out
if somebody is on that flight.

635
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:15,594
His name is DO Guerrero.

636
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:18,871
I'm sorry. We're not allowed
to give out that information.

637
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:22,435
You don't understand. The person
I'm asking about is my husband.

638
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,789
I'm sorry, but it's a company rule.

639
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:27,115
Well, you might go out
to the airport.

640
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:29,390
If you can get there
before they board,

641
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,749
you could see your husband,
if he's there.

642
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:36,157
I see. Well, that's
the only way, I suppose.

643
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:38,668
Thank you. Thank you.

644
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:41,234
Thank you for calling Trans Global.

645
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:58,153
Why didn't you tell me this before?

646
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:00,191
I tried.

647
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,231
But we were in a hurry and...

648
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:04,157
You're sure?

649
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:08,193
Do you mean am I sure I'm pregnant
or am I sure you're the father?

650
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:11,676
- Come on, Gwen. L-I didn't...
- The answer to both is yes.

651
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:13,995
- I wasn't asking...
- You have a right to.

652
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:16,952
I want you to know something, Vern.

653
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,912
That there hasn't been
anyone else but you.

654
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:23,396
You see, there couldn't be.
I happen to love you.

655
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:30,915
I was careless. I stopped taking the
pills because I was gaining weight.

656
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:33,793
So instead of being plump,
I'm pregnant.

657
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:37,915
Stop twisting your wedding ring.

658
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:42,397
I know you've got a wife.
I know you can't marry me.

659
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:44,431
I knew it in the beginning.

660
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:49,473
I won't make things difficult
for you. I'll work it out myself.

661
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:53,672
Don't be ridiculous. You don't think
I'd ignore the whole thing?

662
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:59,317
I'll take care of you. I'll make sure
you don't go to some butcher.

663
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:01,828
I hear Sweden's the best place.

664
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:05,111
Good doctors, good hospitals.
Medically safe.

665
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:07,435
Very quick, very simple.

666
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:10,233
One minute you have it,
the next minute you don't.

667
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:12,794
There's no danger of complications.

668
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:15,434
That is, no physical complications.

669
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:18,313
I'm not so sure
about the moral ones.

670
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:21,318
You have religious scruples?

671
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:23,510
No. No.

672
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:28,629
But the strangest thing happened
today when the doctor told me.

673
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:31,513
I've known other giris
in the same situation

674
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:34,950
toss it off with bad jokes like,
"I've got a bun in the oven",

675
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,037
or "Captain, we've got
an extra passenger on board."

676
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:40,878
I knew I'd react the same way.

677
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:43,832
Very modern, very sophisticated.

678
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,471
But I certainly didn't.

679
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:53,515
I was suddenly filled
with a sense of wonder and awe.

680
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:56,154
I don't want to sound
mystical or anything,

681
00:48:56,200 --> 00:49:00,398
but I am carrying someone
who's part of us.

682
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,635
I'm not so sure I want to lose it.

683
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:07,915
And if you have the baby,
then what?

684
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:14,792
Well, I suppose adoption
would be the answer.

685
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:18,389
They're very careful nowadays.
They find the right family.

686
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:22,353
They're very careful and all
the arrangements are made beforehand.

687
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:25,278
And the records
are kept secret, you know.

688
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:27,788
And you'll never see the baby.

689
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:39,990
I suppose in time I'll be sensible,
but l-I've got to have time to think.

690
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,275
Vern, thank you for caring.

691
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:53,796
Most men would have said,
"So long, girl. Tough luck."

692
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:55,831
Not this one.

693
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:06,955
You know, I think you
really do love me a little.

694
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:12,473
It makes it harder to decide,
but easier to bear.

695
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:22,117
Something wrong, Gwen?

696
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:24,993
The air vent was stuck.
The captain fixed it.

697
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:38,591
Full throttle!

698
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:49,390
All the way!

699
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,837
You chickened out. I said
I wanted all the power you got.

700
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:10,553
At full throttle, this plane
would be on its nose.

701
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:13,512
You might fly these things,
but I put 'em together.

702
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:16,393
If you had any guts,
we'd be on the runway now.

703
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:19,432
10 seconds more, we'd have had
structural damage.

704
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:23,029
Who do you think I am,
some kid that fixes bicycles?

705
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:27,392
I know the 707. Take the wings off
and you could use it as a tank.

706
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:31,228
This plane is built to withstand
anything, except a bad pilot.

707
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,794
All right, hold it.
This will get us nowhere.

708
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:37,753
Tell your mechanic that I've got
over three million miles in the air.

709
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:40,109
And two and a half feet
on the ground.

710
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:42,469
Let's stop wasting time. What now?

711
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:45,353
We got to dig a lot deeper.
Put lumber under the wheels.

712
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:48,198
But next time, since he's afraid,
I'll drive it out.

713
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:51,676
I'm not turning this ship over
to anybody without authorisation.

714
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:53,711
I phoned Kettering - no answer.

715
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,910
Then we sit here
and wait till you get him.

716
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:59,430
No. We haven't got time.
You're on the ground now, Captain,

717
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:01,710
and you're blocking
my primary runway.

718
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:04,194
I'm not using full power.
It's too risky.

719
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:07,915
Then I'll make the decisión.
I'll take the responsibility.

720
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:10,952
Mr Patroni is licensed to taxi.
He'll take over.

721
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:30,233
He tears this ship apart, I hope you
got eight million to pay for it.

722
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:37,996
Joe, my neck's out about 14 feet.

723
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:40,992
- You sure it'll work?
- Let's put it this way.

724
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:44,316
You promised me a box of cigars
if I pulled this off, right?

725
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:47,511
Well, what are you
standing here for? Go get 'em.

726
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:54,833
Bus from the downtown terminal
is just coming in.

727
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,871
'Attention, please.'

728
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:00,635
'Trans Global Airlines, the Golden
Argosy, flight two, non-stop to Rome

729
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:02,671
'is now ready for boarding.

730
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:08,238
'All passengers holding reservations,
please go to gate 33 on concourse D.'

731
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:19,629
Oh, Rome.

732
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:25,755
The Colosseum, the Sistine Chapel.
The Catacombs.

733
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:30,475
My dear late husband and I
always planned to visit there.

734
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:33,239
"See Rome and die," he always said.

735
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:37,472
But he died just
when we were packing.

736
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:39,317
Ah, gee, that's too bad.

737
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:42,955
Yes. So near and yet so far.

738
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:48,755
Mm.

739
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:53,110
- Mm. Mm.
- What's wrong?

740
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:55,151
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

741
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:57,668
- What is it, Mrs Quonsett?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

742
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:00,951
- I'm having one of my spells.
- I'll call for a doctor.

743
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,993
Oh, it's... I'll be all right.
L- I've had these for years.

744
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:07,674

Mm. Mm.

you don't want the doctor?

already. But don't go away.

- Of course. Right away.

But don't worry. I'll be all right.

760
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:06,392
There's an attendant in there. She'll
take care of you. I won't be long.

Uh, that is E-R-O.

763
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:39,149
And what amount policy
were you considering, Mr Guerrero?

764
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,236
Uh, 150,000.

765
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:43,111
- That'll be $5.
- Yes.

766

you could take out 225,000.

for all that protection, is it?

I don't know if I have
that much left. American money.

- We accept foreign currency.

Yeah. Well, I've got that
all in big bills.

Or we'll take a personal cheque.

772

No. When I go to Europe,
I always leave my chequebook at home.

It's too much of a temptation.

I may have enough.

775

Oh. Sorry.

800
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:53,759
Ready?

801
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:57,156
Say, did you see that man
with the attaché case just now?

802
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:58,838
No.

803
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:02,793
Well, if he were coming in
from abroad instead of going out,

804
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:06,435
- I'd want to inspect it.
- You think he's smuggling?

805
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:09,438
It was the way he held the case,
the look in his eye.

806
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:12,119
He tried to hand me his ticket.

807
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:25,952
- Sorry about the delay, Mr Donovan.
- That's OK, Mike.

808
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,230
Excuse me,
my son dropped his wallet...

809
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:30,271
- Madam...
- He just went on board.

810
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:33,118
Blonde hair, camel's hair coat.
I wonder if you'd...

811
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:37,472
I can't accept a wallet with money.
See the stewardess, please.

812
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:26,154
But, you see,
if someone is smuggling,

813
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:29,909
they usually get nervous when they
land, not before they take off.

814
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:31,951
This guy was really shaking.

815
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:35,635
If it is contraband and he's nervous,
Italian customs will nail him.

816
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:38,035
Besides, there's not much
we can do here.

I don't know.
I think somebody ought to.

Maybe you ought to tell your boss,

819
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:45,637
just in case he might
want to notify the captain.

820

01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:39,711
But I'm almost certain she did.

894
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:42,877
Her son dropped his wallet.
She went on to give it to him.

895
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:45,070
The wallet gag. She's on the plane.

896
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:48,072
Maybe that's why
the head count didn't tally.

897
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:51,715
Have you counted yours lately?
You've got at least two.

898
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:54,672
Should I send word to the captain
to check and verify?

899
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:58,759
Yeah, but call him on the company
frequency so we can keep it private.

900
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:07,511
Our ground speed
is 620 miles per hour.

901
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:10,990
We've reached our cruising altitude
of 33,000 feet.

902
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:15,477
'And the temperature outside
is a pleasant 50 degrees below zero.

903
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:19,069
'Our route tonight will take us
over Toronto, Montreal,

904
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:22,669
'Cape Ray, St John, Newfoundland,
across the Atlantic,

905
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:25,757
'reaching the European coastline
just north of Lisbon

906
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:27,791
'and on into Rome on schedule.

907
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:31,913
'The weather in Rome is a lot better
than what we left in Chicago.'

908
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:35,669
If there's anything we can do during
the flight, please let us know.

909
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:37,153
Thank you.

910
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:43,237
This is Global Two.

911
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:47,796
Flight two, I have a message from
Lincoln. Advise when ready to copy.

912
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:51,271
Go ahead, Cleveland. We're ready.

913
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:54,716
Uh, practically certain
you have a stowaway on board.

914
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:57,479
Caucasian. Female.

915
01:08:57,520 --> 01:09:00,717
Approximately 5 feet, 100 pounds.

916
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:02,876
Age about 70.

917
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:05,753
Wearing a brown hat
with a brown pompom,

918
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:08,155
tweed coat with black velvet collar.

919
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:12,313
Name, Mrs Ada Quonsett.
Determine and confirm.

920
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:16,114
- We'll check and advise.
- I don't believe it.

921
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:19,994
Oh, I believe it. Those penguins
on the ground are idiots.

922
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:29,759
Now the guy in 21-D
says it's too hot.

923
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:32,876
You want a laugh?

924
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:34,911
Have you seen her?

925
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:41,959
Well, she's not in first.
I've hardly checked tourist yet.

926
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:45,117
Well, go back and see
if the old biddy's there, huh?

927
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:49,278
- If she is, what do I do?
- Nothing. Just come back and report.

928
01:09:49,320 --> 01:09:52,278
How about that, huh?
Little old lady just walks on

929
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:54,515
like she's walking into an elevator.

930
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:57,951
Excuse me.

931
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:00,917
There you are.

932
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:08,472
Uh, miss. The captain said
we'd arrive on schedule.

933
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:11,512
That means we're going
to make up the hour's delay.

934
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:14,836
Father, with a ground speed
of 620 miles per hour

935
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:17,678
and a distance of 4,817 miles,

936
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:19,990
it's a physical impossibility.

937
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:24,079
Your son is right. The captain was
referring to scheduled flying time.

938
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:28,033
It'll be approximately seven and
a half hours from takeoff.

939
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:32,791
Oh, excuse me.

940
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,389
Oh, I see
you've got a boyfriend.

941
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:43,035
Yes. And he's
invited me to Rome to a nightclub.

942
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:49,268
Miss. Miss. These nuts are stale.

943
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:52,471
I'm sorry, sir. I'll try
and find you some fresher ones.

944
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:56,149
474 dollars
and you get stale nuts.

945
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:59,829
So you play the oboe?
My late husband played the violin.

946
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:02,235
Not professionally,
but he was very good.

947
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:06,353
He once played The Minute Waltz
in 58 seconds.

948
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:08,868
- There you are.
- Thank you so much.

949
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:29,079
- Nuts to the man in 21-D.
- You said it.

950
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:32,516
May I treat you to another sherry?

951
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:37,714
Oh, no. Really. One is all I ever...
Well, thank you. You're very kind.

952
01:11:43,240 --> 01:11:45,993
She's there, all right. 23-B.

953
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:49,589
That's why the head count was wrong.
What do you want me to do?

954
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:54,156
Nothing. If you start questioning her
now, there'll be tears and...

955
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:56,668
We were asked to check
and report, that's all.

956
01:11:56,720 --> 01:12:01,111
They'll grab her in Rome. So,
until then, why make her miserable?

957
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:04,038
You know, Captain,
you're a real nice person.

958
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:06,719
I didn't know you were
so fond of old women.

959
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:09,228
- Oh, I prefer the younger ones.
- So I heard.

960
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:12,556
But opportunities, you know,
don't last forever.

961
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:15,797
Soon, we'll have to settle for
the not-so-young ones.

962
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:18,195
Well, I already have
for quite some time.

963
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:22,870
You always played it straight.
No mucking around on layovers.

964
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:26,151
Helen was a stewardess
flying DC-4s. That's how we met.

965
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:28,191
She knew what was going on.

966
01:12:28,240 --> 01:12:31,630
When we got married, I made her
a promise, the obvious one.

967
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:33,671
I always kept it.

968
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:36,075
I guess all those kids
you had helped.

969
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:38,151
Yeah. Maybe.

970
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:40,873
- How many have you got? Six?
- No, seven.

971
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:43,275
Four we planned, three we didn't.

972
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:51,197
The ones you didn't plan,
uh, did you ever consider...

973
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:53,913
doing anything
about 'em before they were born?

974
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:55,439
No.

975
01:12:56,560 --> 01:12:59,996
Let me tell you something.
I love all seven.

976
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:02,600
But the three we didn't plan,

977
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:05,791
they turned out to be
something real special.

978
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:18,439
Detain on board... after landing.

979
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:21,630
Release only...

980
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:24,069
to station manager, Rome.

981
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:28,834
I'm going to flight dispatch.
I'll take it.

982
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:30,711
I'll take it.

983
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:33,354
No, I don't want it
to wind up in the ladies' room.

984
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:36,472
What about the man
with the attaché case?

985
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:39,239
If Standish wants to know
what he's smuggling,

986
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:41,271
get Italian customs to check.

987
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:45,108
I won't offend a passenger with
something that's not our business.

988
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:47,151
What if he isn't smuggling?

989
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:49,191
Forget it.

990
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,992
I'm sorry, Mrs Livingston,
that he got mad at you.

991
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:59,318
- It was all my fault.
- Never mind. He'll get over it.

992
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:01,794
That man was one of the last
to go aboard.

993
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:04,718
So he probably was on
that bus that was late.

994
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:11,553
Reindel.

995
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:14,353
John, this is Tanya Livingston.
Do me a favour.

996
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:18,075
Read me the list of passengers
on flight two who came on the bus.

997
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:20,156
Hang on, I've got it right here.

998
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:25,476
Never mind the women.
Just the men.

999
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:28,318
OK. Rathbone, Marcus J.

1000
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:30,834
Bonnelli, Luigi.

1001
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:33,309
Guerrero, DO.

1002
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:35,277
Yates, Robert...

1003
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:38,153
- She stood us up, that's all.
- I hope that's all.

1004
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:40,555
You or me?

1005
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:43,956
You.

1006
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:50,550
- Bakersfeld.
- Your wife insisted that I page you.

1007
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:52,795
She's waiting for you in your office.

1008
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:55,797
Thanks.

1009
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:59,037
'American Airlines
flight 46 to Boston

1010
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:02,709
'is now scheduled to depart

1011

'Delta Airlines flight 76 for Atlanta
now departing at gate 12... '

1012
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:10,709
Oh, Mrs Livingston.
I'm sorry to bother you.

1013
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:13,991
One of my men found this woman
wandering about the terminal.

1014
01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:16,031
She seems terribly upset.

1015
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:18,594
- She ought to see the doctor.
- Doesn't want to.

1016
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:21,438
She doesn't have any money
to get back to town.

1017
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:25,234
- I'd like to help, but...
- She let me go through her purse.

1018
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:28,670
I thought I'd find an address book,
call somebody who knew her.

1019
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:30,392
I found this.

1020
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:35,275
Since her husband has a Global ticket
you might give her bus fare home.

1021
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:37,311
Five dollars would do it.

1022
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:40,750
Just take it easy, ma'am.
Everything's going to be fine.

1023
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:45,035
Guerrero.

1024
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:49,157
We don't have a home any more.
We have a waiting room.

1025
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:51,236
A place where I can pace and wonder

1026
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:55,273
whether you're going to leave this
damn airport long enough to drop by.

1027
01:15:55,320 --> 01:15:57,993
Why you have to pick tonight
to come out here...

1028
01:15:58,040 --> 01:16:00,873
I came here to tell you
that Roberta left home.

1029
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:04,918
What do you mean, left home? When?

1030
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:07,793
I called from the banquet
and I spoke to Libby.

1031
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:11,833
Roberta told her that she couldn't
stand our fighting any longer,

1032
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:14,633
that she couldn't stand
"the atmosphere of hate."

1033
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:16,477
That's a direct quote.

1034
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:18,911
Where is she? Did Libby say?

1035
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:22,589
She's spending the night at Sally
Bolton's house. I spoke to her.

1036
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:26,390
Cindy, we can't do this to the kids.

1037
01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:29,671
We've got to call a truce,
even if it's a pretence.

1038
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:32,473
We've got to start
being civil to each other.

1039
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:36,195
And add hypocrisy to the problem?
They'd see through that in a minute.

1040
01:16:36,280 --> 01:16:38,510
Well, we've got to do something.

1041
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:40,551
You're right.

1042
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:42,909
And the only answer is a divorce.

1043
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:47,988
You think that will make them feel
more secure? A broken home?

1044
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:52,113
It's better to come from
a broken home than to live in one.

1045
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:55,996
You may be right.

1046
01:16:56,040 --> 01:16:58,554
And you may be right about me, too.

1047
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:01,194
I suppose I'm like
a lot of men, a bigamist.

1048
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:03,515
Married to both a woman and a job.

1049
01:17:03,560 --> 01:17:07,633
And I can't be
number two wife any longer.

1050
01:17:12,240 --> 01:17:15,073
- Yes, Danny?
- 'Patroni wants a skip loader.'

1051
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:18,874
Get one from the parking lot. We've
got to get that plane out of there.

1052
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:22,469
And, Danny, keep twenty-niner clean
so it'll be operational.

1053
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:26,035
See? Those things are more important
to you than we are.

1054
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:29,277
Not more important.
But at the moment more imperative.

1055
01:17:29,320 --> 01:17:32,437
- We're in a hell of a mess.
- We certainly are.

1056
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:40,918
It's a big step, Cindy. You sure
you don't want to reconsider?

1057
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:43,349
No. It's too late, Mel.

1058
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:46,790
It's not just the giris
that I'm thinking of.

1059
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:51,072
There's someone else, Mel,
and there has been for quite a while.

1060
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:54,317
Someone who makes me feel
wanted occasionally.

1061
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:57,750
You had no idea, had you?

1062
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:02,477
Too busy to even consider
the possibility.

1063
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:09,874
Cindy, uh... Mrs Livingston.
Mrs Bakersfeld.

1064
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:11,672
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

1065
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:14,678
I have some information on that man
with the attaché case.

1066
01:18:14,720 --> 01:18:17,029
We'll talk about it
in a little while.

1067
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:19,071
Certainly.

1068
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:27,272
Are you sure?
Are you really sure?

1069
01:18:27,320 --> 01:18:29,311
Yes.

1070
01:18:33,720 --> 01:18:36,712
When we tell the children,
we must do it together.

1071
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:40,230
Of course. And I promise there
won't be any trouble.

1072
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:42,714
You may see the giris
as often as you wish.

1073
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:44,671
Thanks.

1074
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:48,315
As a matter of fact, you'll
probably see them more often.

1075
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:51,750
Ex-husbands always seem
to make a special effort.

1076
01:19:00,720 --> 01:19:02,597
Bakersfeld.

1077
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:04,596
Hang on a second.

1078
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:08,189
Ned? I'll be right with you.
OK, Hank, go ahead.

1079
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:11,437
Yes. Well, that's all right.
Put it in warehouse 12.

1080
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:14,870
Get the trucks out.
They're not supposed to be there.

1081
01:19:14,920 --> 01:19:16,478
Right.

1082
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:18,431
What's up, Ned?
Let the police handle it.

1083
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:32,472
Now, you stay right here.
I'll just be a minute.

1084
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:46,790
The terminal said they remembered
a man with an attaché case.

1085
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:50,549
- They must have had ten of them.
- But this one held it under his arm.

1086
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:54,752
And when the agent tried to tag it,
he insisted on putting it on himself.

1087
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:57,951
That's why they remembered him.
And it WAS Guerrero.

1088
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:02,391
I can't get anything out of his wife
except a blank stare.

1089
01:20:02,440 --> 01:20:05,238
Maybe YOU can make her talk.
Please try.

1090
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:08,317
- I have a horrible feeling.
- All right, bring her in.

1091
01:20:10,520 --> 01:20:12,192
Mrs Guerrero...

1092
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:17,872
'... please come to the courtesy phone

1093
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:20,832
'at the terminal
information counter.'

1094
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:27,271
She's gone.

1095
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:33,632
Hold it. Yes, sir?

1096
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:36,148
Remember the woman
with Mrs Livingston?

1097
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:39,476
She's run off. She's probably
still here. Find her, Ned.

1098
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:42,956
- Will you round up my boys?
- We'll announce from here.

1099
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,594
You do it.
I'll call the insurance company.

1100
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:49,997
- What's the security code tonight?
- Lester Mainwaring.

1101
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:55,353
Attention, please.
Attention, please.

1102
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:57,749
'For Mr Lester Mainwaring's party.

1103
01:20:57,800 --> 01:21:01,190
'Mr Mainwaring requests that
all members of his travel group

1104
01:21:01,240 --> 01:21:04,391
'report immediately
to the main terminal entrance.

1105
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:06,510
'To the main terminal entrance.'

1106
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:14,796
Yes. Here it is, Mr Bakersfeld.
DO Guerrero. It's for 225,000.

1107
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:18,635
Yes, I remember him.

1108
01:21:18,680 --> 01:21:21,672
Yes, sir, he was a little nervous.

1109
01:21:21,720 --> 01:21:24,393
Did you notice anything unusual
about him?

1110
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:26,635
'Well, just one thing.

1111
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:30,514
'For somebody going to Europe,
he didn't seem to have much money.

1112
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:34,235
'He paid me with six $1 bills
and the rest in change.

1113
01:21:34,280 --> 01:21:38,353
'Mostly nickels and dimes. It seemed
to be just about all he had.'

1114
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:40,197
Thanks.

1115
01:21:57,320 --> 01:22:01,233
You've been so busy.
We just haven't had a chance to chat.

1116
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:03,191
I'm Ada Quonsett.

1117
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:05,191
How do you do?

1118
01:22:05,240 --> 01:22:07,959
What's your name, sir?

1119
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,150
Guerrero.

1120
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:13,237
Guerrero? That's Spanish, isn't it?

1121
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:15,714
Yes. But way back.

1122
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:17,796
You look more Irish.

1123
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:20,070
So did my mother.

1124
01:22:20,120 --> 01:22:23,908
I've been fascinated by that figuring
you've been doing on the map.

1125
01:22:23,960 --> 01:22:26,554
I said to Mr Davidson
I was sure you'd win.

1126
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:29,830
The contest.

1127
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:33,714
The one that comes the closest
to guessing our time of arrival

1128
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:35,990
wins a sightseeing trip.

1129
01:22:36,040 --> 01:22:38,270
Oh. No. L-l-I didn't know.

1130
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:40,550
No, I just do this
as sort of a hobby.

1131
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:44,957
I like to see if I can calculate
where we are all the time.

1132
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,468
- Now that's...
- If you'll excuse me,

1133
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:49,909
I think I'll take a little nap.

1134
01:22:52,640 --> 01:22:56,349
"Approach with extreme caution.
His seat assignment is 23-A."

1135
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:59,392
Have a dispatcher send it
on the company frequency.

1136
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:02,159
Probably New York.
They're out of Cleveland by now.

1137
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:04,395
He might just be
an ordinary eccentric.

1138
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:07,870
- Maybe it's just important papers.
- I don't think so.

1139
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:10,354
I wish I did.
I have a niece aboard that flight.

1140
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:12,391
Right. Suppose he has got a bomb.

1141
01:23:12,440 --> 01:23:15,273
They've been up there an hour.
Why hasn't he let it go?

1142
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:19,108
I don't know. Maybe he's waiting
until they're over the ocean.

1143
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:22,550
The Atlantic doesn't leave traces.

1144
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:26,513
We found the Guerrero woman.
One of my men is bringing her up.

1145
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:28,869
Hold that call.
We may have something to add.

1146
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:30,911
I'll call you right back.

1147
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:33,793
Now they say it's too cold.

1148
01:23:42,680 --> 01:23:44,511
Oh, he has fainting spells.

1149
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:47,836
So when he feels one coming on,
he takes a whiff of oxygen.

1150
01:23:47,880 --> 01:23:49,916
Sometimes it helps.

1151
01:23:54,640 --> 01:23:58,155
Don't let him kid you.
It's an FAA regulation.

1152
01:23:58,200 --> 01:24:01,158
Over 25,000, if one of us
leaves the flight deck,

1153
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:03,191
the other one must go on oxygen.

1154
01:24:03,240 --> 01:24:05,629
- It's just a precaution.
- Thanks.

1155
01:24:15,160 --> 01:24:18,072
Why didn't you ring?
I could have brought you that.

1156
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:20,111
Up there I'd have to be formal.

1157
01:24:20,160 --> 01:24:24,039
Up there, l-I couldn't tell you,
uh, how sorry I am.

1158
01:24:25,080 --> 01:24:27,674
- How do you feel?
- I feel great, Vern.

1159
01:24:27,720 --> 01:24:32,111
No fainting spells. No craving
for pickles. No morning sickness.

1160
01:24:33,560 --> 01:24:36,438
It's funny. I didn't think
you were the kind of a guy

1161
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:38,835
who would worry
about a thing like this.

1162
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:40,871
Neither did I.

1163
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:44,629
Before you said that you thought
I loved you just a little.

1164
01:24:44,680 --> 01:24:48,468
You were wrong. I... I love you
a lot more than just a little.

1165
01:25:05,320 --> 01:25:07,436
I didn't know he was going to Rome.

1166
01:25:07,480 --> 01:25:09,596
He said he was going to Milwaukee.

1167
01:25:09,640 --> 01:25:12,598
Here, Inez,
take another sip of this.

1168
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:17,439
But this was in your purse.
You must have known.

1169
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:20,711
It just came tonight. Special.

1170
01:25:20,760 --> 01:25:22,955
I only saw it after he left.

1171
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:27,198
Does your husband
have business in Italy?

1172
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:30,595
What is your husband's business?

1173
01:25:30,680 --> 01:25:32,716
Oh, he's, uh... He was...

1174
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:36,275
He did excavations f-for buildings.

1175
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:39,232
You said "was".
He's not in that business any more?

1176
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:41,589
Things... went wrong.

1177
01:25:41,640 --> 01:25:43,915
- Financial trouble?
- Yes.

1178
01:25:43,960 --> 01:25:48,556
Bad trouble? Broke? In debt?

1179
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:51,910
Then how'd he get the money
for his ticket?

1180
01:25:51,960 --> 01:25:55,509
I think, uh... he pawned
my mother's wedding ring.

1181
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:58,870
When I looked tonight
in the case, it was empty.

1182
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:04,472
He... He just can't seem
to hold a job lately.

1183
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:06,317
Why not?

1184
01:26:06,360 --> 01:26:09,716
He gets in arguments.
They fire him. It's his temper.

1185
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:12,917
He's been like that ever since
he got out of the hospital.

1186
01:26:15,160 --> 01:26:17,879
- What sort of hospital?
- Army hospital.

1187
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:21,196
Yes, but, uh, I mean,
what was he in the hospital for?

1188
01:26:23,080 --> 01:26:24,911
He, uh...

1189
01:26:25,960 --> 01:26:27,951
was sick.

1190
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:33,749
A mental patient?

1191
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:36,519
Mrs Guerrero, what did
your husband do in the Army?

1192
01:26:37,720 --> 01:26:39,756
He was a demolition expert.

1193
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:46,997
And I suppose in his excavation work
he used explosives?

1194
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:49,156
He...

1195
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:53,117
- He, um...
- You were about to say something.

1196
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:57,952
His last job, they fired him.

1197
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:01,549
Something was missing. Some dynamite.

1198
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:07,438
What we need's an unlisted number.

1199
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:10,791
This is Global Two.

1200
01:27:10,840 --> 01:27:13,513
Global Two, New York.
We have an important message.

1201
01:27:13,560 --> 01:27:15,357
Advise when ready to copy.

1202
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:20,597
OK, New York, go ahead.

1203
01:27:20,640 --> 01:27:22,551
Strong probability...

1204
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:27,435
Repeat, strong probability exists
that passenger DO Guerrero,

1205
01:27:27,480 --> 01:27:29,391
seat assignment 23-A,

1206
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:33,353
may have an explosive device
in attaché-type briefcase.

1207
01:27:33,400 --> 01:27:36,198
Passenger purchased
excessive insurance,

1208
01:27:36,240 --> 01:27:38,674
mentally disturbed and desperate.

1209
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:40,711
Approach with extreme caution.

1210
01:27:40,760 --> 01:27:44,992
Yeah, that's right. Tell 'em another
section of 3-by-12s laid crosswise.

1211
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:47,076
- 'Will do.'
- They need you?

1212
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:49,554
It won't be ready
to drive out for a half hour.

1213
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:51,909
Ingram knows what to do
in the meantime.

1214
01:27:51,960 --> 01:27:54,793
So we know the kook
is sittin' in 23-A. That's here.

1215
01:27:54,840 --> 01:27:57,035
That's right. What's your opinion?

1216
01:27:57,080 --> 01:27:59,878
They should get the hell
back here as fast as they can.

1217
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:04,550
If he should let it go, could the
plane possibly stand the explosión?

1218
01:28:04,600 --> 01:28:07,194
We got one break...
he's not in an aisle seat.

1219
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:10,232
So first it'll blow out
a hunk of the fuselage here.

1220
01:28:10,280 --> 01:28:12,271
What kind of damage will that cause?

1221
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:14,880
Luckily, there's nothing
but skin on the sides.

1222
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:17,269
All the control cables
run along here,

1223
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:19,920
so if it's not too big a hole,
she might fly.

1224
01:28:19,960 --> 01:28:24,238
But the sudden decompressión
at 30,000 feet is somethin' else.

1225
01:28:24,280 --> 01:28:27,989
- He'll get sucked out, won't he?
- So will anybody next to him.

1226
01:28:28,040 --> 01:28:30,076
Until that pressure equalises,

1227
01:28:30,120 --> 01:28:34,079
everything within 20 feet is gonna
get sucked out that hole.

1228
01:28:34,120 --> 01:28:39,274
- Is it that powerful? Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

1229
01:28:39,320 --> 01:28:41,675
When I was a mechanic
in the Air Force,

1230
01:28:41,720 --> 01:28:44,075
I was being transferred
on a MATS plane.

1231
01:28:44,120 --> 01:28:46,680
At 20,000 feet,
one of the windows shattered.

1232
01:28:46,720 --> 01:28:49,393
The guy sitting next to me
was about 170 pounds.

1233
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:53,672
He went through that space like a
hunk of hamburger goin' down a plug,

1234
01:28:53,720 --> 01:28:57,315
and right after him coats,
pillows, blankets, cups, saucers.

1235
01:28:57,360 --> 01:29:00,955
- Yeah, I'm sure.
- Takes about three seconds.

1236
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,070
Depends on the size of the hole.

1237
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:06,271
Everything fogs up just like that.
And then watch out.

1238
01:29:06,320 --> 01:29:08,436
At that altitude you can't breathe,

1239
01:29:08,480 --> 01:29:12,189
so unless they get on oxygen
in 45 seconds, it's goodbye.

1240
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:31,431
We'll turn back.

1241
01:29:31,480 --> 01:29:33,755
I'm gonna make a wide, slow turn.

1242
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:36,598
That way the passengers
might not notice.

1243
01:29:36,640 --> 01:29:40,349
Toronto Centre, this is Global Two.
Seem to have a problem here.

1244
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:43,517
Request clearance back to Lincoln
at a lower altitude.

1245
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:46,552
Roger, Global Two.
Turn left, heading 2-7-0.

1246
01:29:46,600 --> 01:29:48,955
Descend and maintain
flight level 2-8-0.

1247
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:50,991
Are you declaring an emergency?

1248
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:54,430
Possible emergency.
Might have a disturbed passenger.

1249
01:29:55,640 --> 01:29:59,679
There's no mistake. He's in 23-A.
Fits the description perfectly.

1250
01:29:59,720 --> 01:30:02,871
- When did you see him?
- When I was boarding Mrs Quonsett.

1251
01:30:02,920 --> 01:30:06,515
- He's sitting right next to her.
- Did you notice the attaché case?

1252
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:08,915
It's on his lap,
and he won't put it down.

1253
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:11,235
Ruth said when she was
serving the snacks,

1254
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:13,271
he wouldn't use the pull-down table.

1255
01:30:13,320 --> 01:30:15,754
He insisted on
putting his tray on his case.

1256
01:30:15,800 --> 01:30:17,677
Sounds as if that's where it is.

1257
01:30:17,720 --> 01:30:21,110
Then he must have a trigger
on the outside of the case.

1258
01:30:21,160 --> 01:30:23,674
Is anyone on the other side
of the old lady?

1259
01:30:23,720 --> 01:30:25,836
A man.

1260
01:30:25,880 --> 01:30:29,668
I'd have to lean over two people.
I couldn't surprise him like that.

1261
01:30:29,720 --> 01:30:31,790
OK if I go back and take a look?

1262
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:35,150
Yeah. Not too close a look.
He might suspect something.

1263
01:30:37,640 --> 01:30:42,031
I'll do one of those smiling
"good evening" walk-throughs,

1264
01:30:42,080 --> 01:30:45,152
and if anybody catches the fact
that we're turning around,

1265
01:30:45,200 --> 01:30:47,236
I'll give 'em some double talk.

1266
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:51,990
Toronto Centre, Global Two.
Starting turn, wide and gradual.

1267
01:30:52,040 --> 01:30:54,190
Global Two, wide turn approved.

1268
01:30:54,240 --> 01:30:56,595
We'll alert other sectors
to your problem.

1269
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:10,437
So delay serving dinner.

1270
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:14,029
Put every bottle, glass and
everything else away and lock it up.

1271
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:17,789
- Right. Be careful, Vern.
- I'll tell the giris in tourist.

1272
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:20,992
Captain.

1273
01:31:26,440 --> 01:31:28,317
Oh, oh, Captain.

1274
01:31:28,360 --> 01:31:32,592
Our son has a question to ask you.
Schuyler, here's our captain.

1275
01:31:32,640 --> 01:31:35,473
Before, Virgo and Leo
were right there, sir.

1276
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:38,557
Now I'm beginning to see
Ursa Minor and Cassiopeia.

1277
01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:40,591
We must be turning around.

1278
01:31:40,640 --> 01:31:43,393
Why, you have a young navigator here.

1279
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:45,510
Well, I'll tell you, son.

1280
01:31:45,560 --> 01:31:47,357
Due to a setsel wind,

1281
01:31:47,400 --> 01:31:50,756
DISTOR has vectored us into
a 360 tunsun of slower traffic.

1282
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:52,791
We'll maintain this borton hold

1283
01:31:52,840 --> 01:31:56,389
until we get a fortamagnus clearance
from MALNAKS.

1284
01:31:56,440 --> 01:31:59,193
Oh. Yes, of course.

1285
01:32:02,920 --> 01:32:05,229
What did he mean by that, Son?

1286
01:32:05,280 --> 01:32:07,874
Never mind, Father.
I'll tell you later.

1287
01:32:09,320 --> 01:32:11,311
- Enjoying your trip?
- Very much.

1288
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:14,238
I was just telling my wife
how smooth it is.

1289
01:32:14,280 --> 01:32:17,397
I put my drink on the armrest,
didn't lose a drop.

1290
01:32:22,080 --> 01:32:23,911
Hi, giris.

1291
01:32:23,960 --> 01:32:27,032
- Slumming, Captain?
- No, we got bumpy weather ahead.

1292
01:32:27,080 --> 01:32:30,152
Don't serve dinner yet.
Keep everything in drawers.

1293
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:34,951
- Are you getting them?
- 'Yes.'

1294
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:37,508
They've turned
and started a slow descent.

1295
01:32:37,560 --> 01:32:40,996
- What's the frequency?
- 132.0.

1296
01:32:45,040 --> 01:32:47,349
I'm sorry to have to put this on you,

1297
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:50,870
but if I go back there a second time,
he might get suspicious.

1298
01:32:50,920 --> 01:32:53,718
Don't worry.
I think I can handle it.

1299
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:09,872
Excuse me, madam.
May I see your ticket?

1300
01:33:09,920 --> 01:33:13,469
My ticket? That nice young man
at the gate took it.

1301
01:33:13,520 --> 01:33:15,511
No, he wouldn't do that.

1302
01:33:15,560 --> 01:33:18,996
If it was a round-trip ticket, you'd
have the return flight coupon.

1303
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:22,715
If it was a one-way, you'd still have
the ticket stub and folder.

1304
01:33:22,760 --> 01:33:24,637
You're English, aren't you?

1305
01:33:24,680 --> 01:33:27,513
I knew it the moment
you started to talk.

1306
01:33:27,560 --> 01:33:30,120
You make our language
sound so delightful.

1307
01:33:30,160 --> 01:33:33,470
- My late husband...
- Never mind. What about your ticket?

1308
01:33:33,560 --> 01:33:35,869
I'll certainly look, but I'm sure...

1309
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:38,753
Why don't you stop
wasting my time, Mrs Quonsett?

1310
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:41,155
You are Mrs Ada Quonsett,
aren't you?

1311
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:44,510
Since you're aware of who I am,
there's no use denying it.

1312
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:46,869
If there's a misunderstanding,
may I help?

1313
01:33:46,920 --> 01:33:50,117
There's no misunderstanding.
Are you travelling with her?

1314
01:33:50,160 --> 01:33:52,196
- No.
- Then it's none of your business.

1315
01:33:52,240 --> 01:33:54,037
This woman is a stowaway.

1316
01:33:54,080 --> 01:33:57,675
- Are we going to turn back?
- You're not that important.

1317
01:33:57,720 --> 01:34:00,632
When we land, you'll be
handed over to the authorities.

1318
01:34:00,680 --> 01:34:03,638
Come with me. The captain
has to make a report on you.

1319
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:06,877
But first he'd like to see you.
Let this lady out, please.

1320
01:34:06,920 --> 01:34:08,911
The captain wants to see me?

1321
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:11,076
And he doesn't like
to be kept waiting.

1322
01:34:11,120 --> 01:34:14,396
- Don't treat her like a criminal.
- That's what she is.

1323
01:34:14,440 --> 01:34:16,431
Imagine shoving an old lady.

1324
01:34:16,480 --> 01:34:19,995
I've never seen anything like it.
I can't believe she's a stowaway.

1325
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:36,310
Mrs Quonsett, I'm Captain Demerest.
This is Captain Harris.

1326
01:34:36,360 --> 01:34:38,920
Would you come forward
as far as you can?

1327
01:34:41,320 --> 01:34:43,595
Oh, Captain...

1328
01:34:43,680 --> 01:34:45,875
Please sit down, Mrs Quonsett.

1329
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:47,911
I'm sorry to be a trouble to you,

1330
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:51,197
but I was on my way to New York
to visit my poor daughter...

1331
01:34:51,240 --> 01:34:53,276
Then why'd you get on this flight?

1332
01:34:53,320 --> 01:34:58,155
Because the next flight back from
Rome is to New York, your number 5.

1333
01:34:58,200 --> 01:35:02,591
I thought they'd want to get rid of
me, so they'd put me on that plane.

1334
01:35:02,640 --> 01:35:07,270
If you help us, I promise you'll
get trips to New York first-class.

1335
01:35:07,320 --> 01:35:10,676
Oh. Thank you. But how can I help?

1336
01:35:10,720 --> 01:35:14,872
Mrs Quonsett, whatever happened
back there just now, you can forget.

1337
01:35:14,920 --> 01:35:17,354
That's not why you were brought here.

1338
01:35:17,400 --> 01:35:19,960
Mrs Quonsett,
I hope I didn't hurt you.

1339
01:35:20,040 --> 01:35:22,349
No, no... not much.

1340
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:24,550
Ma'am, are you frightened easily?

1341
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:29,310
No. I get nervous sometimes,
but not as much as I used to.

1342
01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:32,670
When you get older, there isn't
a lot left to be frightened of.

1343
01:35:32,720 --> 01:35:36,269
Good. All right, now,
you listen very carefully...

1344
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:38,880
'Global Two,
this is Toronto Centre.

1345
01:35:38,920 --> 01:35:43,118
'You're 15 miles east of Kleinburg
Intersection. Say altitude.'

1346
01:35:43,160 --> 01:35:46,755
'Level at 2-8-0.
Request continued slow descent.'

1347
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:49,519
'Roger, Global Two.
What altitude? '

1348
01:35:49,560 --> 01:35:53,553
- 'Request level 2-1-0.'
- 'Roger. Continue slow descent.

1349
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:55,591
'Maintain flight level 2-1-0.'

1350
01:35:55,640 --> 01:35:58,074
Mel, I talked to
the other commissioners,

1351
01:35:58,120 --> 01:35:59,917
and they all agree with me.

1352
01:35:59,960 --> 01:36:03,270
So as not to have any more trouble
with the Meadowood residents,

1353
01:36:03,320 --> 01:36:06,756
I'm instructing you to shut
the airport down until 7 am.

1354
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:14,110
Read this. A dispatch we just sent.

1355
01:36:14,160 --> 01:36:18,199
The plane's on its way back here.
You still want us to shut down?

1356
01:36:18,240 --> 01:36:20,959
Under the circumstances,
I, uh, I...

1357
01:36:24,480 --> 01:36:28,359
'Global Two, this is Toronto Centre.
Continue slow descent.'

1358
01:36:30,360 --> 01:36:33,591
Whatever she's done, you don't
have to be so rough on her.

1359
01:36:33,640 --> 01:36:36,279
Please don't interfere.

1360
01:36:39,960 --> 01:36:41,757
Ask the captain to reconsider.

1361
01:36:41,800 --> 01:36:44,314
I don't want to be handed over
to the Italian police.

1362
01:36:44,360 --> 01:36:48,069
- You should have thought of that.
- All I ask is to be sent back.

1363
01:36:48,120 --> 01:36:50,998
Please don't hand me over
in a foreign country.

1364
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:53,031
Can't you see the lady's upset?

1365
01:36:53,080 --> 01:36:55,799
Keep out of this.
Now sit down and be quiet!

1366
01:36:55,880 --> 01:36:59,668
- You hurt me! You hurt me!
- Stop it! You're hysterical!

1367
01:37:00,960 --> 01:37:03,679
Help me! Please, help me!

1368
01:37:03,720 --> 01:37:06,871
No. No! No!

1369
01:37:07,240 --> 01:37:11,438
That's his personal property! You've
got no right to take that from him!

1370
01:37:12,920 --> 01:37:15,798
No! Stop!
Stay where you are!

1371
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:17,876
Don't try to get any closer.

1372
01:37:20,240 --> 01:37:23,437
Guerrero, listen to me.
Do you hear me?

1373
01:37:23,480 --> 01:37:25,357
Listen.

1374
01:37:25,400 --> 01:37:30,269
They know about you on the ground.
Your insurance is no good.

1375
01:37:30,320 --> 01:37:32,550
It's cancelled. It's worthless.

1376
01:37:32,600 --> 01:37:36,878
No one has ever gotten away with it.
No one has ever collected a penny.

1377
01:37:38,520 --> 01:37:41,557
You won't help your family.
You'll only hurt 'em.

1378
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:44,831
You'll kill yourself for nothing
if you explode that bomb.

1379
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:47,599
Stay where you are!

1380
01:37:47,640 --> 01:37:50,313
Your family
will be hounded and blamed.

1381
01:37:50,360 --> 01:37:52,351
Listen to me. Think.

1382
01:37:53,720 --> 01:37:57,030
Guerrero, let these people sit down,
and we'll talk.

1383
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:02,629
I promise, until you're ready,
no one will come close.

1384
01:38:06,320 --> 01:38:08,117
Sit down.

1385
01:38:11,320 --> 01:38:14,039
Guerrero, you know now
that you've failed.

1386
01:38:18,680 --> 01:38:22,559
The only way you can help your family
is to give me that case.

1387
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:26,631
Give me the case.

1388
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:31,754
If you do, I promise that no one
on this plane will hurt you.

1389
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:41,911
Grab him! He's got a bomb!

1390
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:29,991
Get on oxygen!

1391
01:39:32,680 --> 01:39:35,194
Mayday! Mayday!

1392
01:40:07,440 --> 01:40:13,072
Trans Global Two. Decompressión.
Making emergency descent.

1393
01:40:18,640 --> 01:40:21,200
'Request one-zero-thousand.'

1394
01:40:21,240 --> 01:40:25,233
Roger. Descend and maintain.
Report your intentions when ready.

1395
01:41:11,120 --> 01:41:12,633
Global Two, Toronto Centre.

1396
01:41:12,680 --> 01:41:16,832
'We're level at one-zero-thousand.
Returning to heading 2-7-0.

1397
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:20,031
'We have damage due to explosión.
Extent unknown.'

1398
01:41:21,880 --> 01:41:24,110
Turn on all the heat you've got.

1399
01:41:25,160 --> 01:41:27,151
Can we maintain control?

1400
01:41:27,200 --> 01:41:30,317
The rudder's heavy and the
stabiliser trim won't respond,

1401
01:41:30,360 --> 01:41:32,715
but at least the tail
didn't fall off.

1402
01:41:32,760 --> 01:41:35,638
- Where'd he pull the trigger?
- In the starboard can.

1403
01:41:35,680 --> 01:41:38,478
Go check the damage
and report by inter-phone.

1404
01:41:38,520 --> 01:41:41,592
According to the manifest,
there's three doctors aboard.

1405
01:41:41,640 --> 01:41:45,713
- Let's hope they're not dentists.
- They're probably helping already.

1406
01:41:45,760 --> 01:41:48,672
And find out about Gwen.

1407
01:41:51,720 --> 01:41:54,951
I'm so cold. I'm terribly cold.

1408
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:58,993
Put him on the walker.
I'm gonna cut off the oxygen.

1409
01:41:59,040 --> 01:42:02,828
You can breathe normally. Take off
your mask. Fasten your seat belt.

1410
01:42:02,880 --> 01:42:04,871
Fasten your seat belts!

1411
01:42:07,720 --> 01:42:11,599
You can breathe normally. Take off
the mask. Fasten your seat belts.

1412
01:42:11,640 --> 01:42:14,473
- Anything I can do to help?
- Yeah. Come on, Sergeant.

1413
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:16,869
Are you all right, dear?

1414
01:42:16,920 --> 01:42:19,912
- Can we get a blanket?
- Fasten your seat belts.

1415
01:42:19,960 --> 01:42:22,315
Can we get a blanket?

1416
01:42:23,280 --> 01:42:26,511
Stewardess, if there's
any brandy on board, pass it out.

1417
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:29,438
- Pardon me. Doctor?
- Yes, Sister?

1418
01:42:29,480 --> 01:42:31,357
Press that hard.

1419
01:42:31,400 --> 01:42:34,198
- May we have a blanket?
- Are you all right?

1420
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:37,118
- May I help you?
- No, I'm all right, thank you.

1421
01:42:37,160 --> 01:42:39,674
Take care of that man behind me.

1422
01:42:46,520 --> 01:42:48,670
- How is her pulse, Sister?
- Weak.

1423
01:42:48,720 --> 01:42:52,633
I have some adrenaline and syringes
in my bag. Would you prepare a shot?

1424
01:42:52,680 --> 01:42:54,671
OK.

1425
01:42:54,720 --> 01:42:56,517
Will it hold?

1426
01:42:56,560 --> 01:42:59,358
Yeah, as soon as I get
this blanket wedged in here.

1427
01:43:13,040 --> 01:43:14,712
Joan.

1428
01:43:14,760 --> 01:43:17,752
As soon as they're patched up,
move them all forward.

1429
01:43:17,800 --> 01:43:20,837
Stow the centre armrests.
Put four people in three seats.

1430
01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:22,472
Right.

1431
01:43:27,320 --> 01:43:29,117
Go ahead.

1432
01:43:29,160 --> 01:43:31,515
The hole is about
three to four feet.

1433
01:43:31,560 --> 01:43:34,358
What about control surfaces?
See anything?

1434
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:38,791
Possible damage to rudder power and
we seem to have stabiliser problems.

1435
01:43:38,840 --> 01:43:41,229
Most of the blast,
thank God, went sideways.

1436
01:43:41,280 --> 01:43:43,919
- Can we stay in the air an hour?
- Hard to tell.

1437
01:43:43,960 --> 01:43:48,317
There's a tear in the ceiling from
the top of the hole to the port side.

1438
01:43:48,360 --> 01:43:51,875
- A rupture in the outer skin?
- I don't know. Could be.

1439
01:43:51,920 --> 01:43:55,913
- What about the passengers?
- I can't say anything definite yet.

1440
01:43:55,960 --> 01:43:58,315
I checked
the structural damage first.

1441
01:43:58,360 --> 01:44:00,715
What I did see
was less than I expected.

1442
01:44:00,760 --> 01:44:03,228
Some cuts and bruises
and shock and puking.

1443
01:44:03,280 --> 01:44:07,558
Medical help good. I'm going
to cut off the passenger oxygen.

1444
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:09,591
How's Gwen?

1445
01:44:09,640 --> 01:44:13,076
Pretty bad shape.
The doctor's working on her.

1446
01:44:13,120 --> 01:44:15,350
I'll report when I can.

1447
01:44:15,400 --> 01:44:18,551
Sounds like the break
is just this side of the tail.

1448
01:44:18,600 --> 01:44:21,512
- Better set down as fast as we can.
- Right.

1449
01:44:23,640 --> 01:44:25,232
Toronto Centre, Global Two.

1450
01:44:25,280 --> 01:44:29,751
Have structural damage. Would like
to land nearest available airport.

1451
01:44:29,800 --> 01:44:31,870
Global Two, Toronto Centre.

1452
01:44:31,920 --> 01:44:36,994
Everything east of Lincoln is closed
due to weather or field conditions.

1453
01:44:37,040 --> 01:44:41,511
However, if you are declaring
an emergency, Detroit possible.

1454
01:44:41,560 --> 01:44:44,358
They report five inches
of snow over ice,

1455
01:44:44,440 --> 01:44:46,749
but they will try to clear.

1456
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:50,588
Request Detroit stand by
in case of any change in condition.

1457
01:44:50,640 --> 01:44:52,551
We'll try for Lincoln.

1458
01:44:52,600 --> 01:44:55,433
Roger, Global Two.
You are leaving my area.

1459
01:44:55,480 --> 01:44:58,950
Contact Cleveland Centre, 117.5.

1460
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:00,877
Good luck.

1461
01:45:00,920 --> 01:45:02,797
Roger, Toronto.

1462
01:45:05,520 --> 01:45:08,956
Cleveland Centre,
Global Two on your frequency.

1463
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:12,549
Global Two, this is
Cleveland Centre radar contact.

1464
01:45:12,600 --> 01:45:16,195
Turn right, heading 2-8-0.
Maintain one-zero-thousand.

1465
01:45:16,240 --> 01:45:20,279
Lincoln weather - sky obscured,
visibility one mile in blowing snow.

1466
01:45:20,320 --> 01:45:22,595
Runway two-niner still closed.

1467
01:45:22,640 --> 01:45:26,633
But we have control damage
which makes landing there imperative.

1468
01:45:26,680 --> 01:45:28,557
'Repeat - imperative.'

1469
01:45:28,600 --> 01:45:31,797
'Roger, Global Two.
We'll relay your request.'

1470
01:45:31,840 --> 01:45:34,832
Keep monitoring, Bert.
I'll be in Mobile One.

1471
01:45:34,880 --> 01:45:37,599
'Global Two,
this is Cleveland... '

1472
01:45:37,640 --> 01:45:42,270
All eyeglasses off. Eyeglasses off.
All eyeglasses off.

1473
01:45:42,320 --> 01:45:44,151
Take off your eyeglasses

1474
01:45:44,200 --> 01:45:47,033
and return your seats
to their upright position!

1475
01:45:47,080 --> 01:45:51,517
Take off your eyeglasses and return
your seats to their upright position.

1476
01:46:14,880 --> 01:46:18,111
What's more, the captain
deliberately struck my face!

1477
01:46:18,160 --> 01:46:22,278
Unless you shut up, the second
officer will do the same thing.

1478
01:46:22,320 --> 01:46:24,390
Is there anything
I can do to help?

1479
01:46:24,440 --> 01:46:28,319
Yes, Father. I'm putting you
in charge of praying.

1480
01:46:28,360 --> 01:46:31,830
If that's an order, you're about
30 minutes too late, son.

1481
01:46:33,240 --> 01:46:35,310
This is Captain Demerest.

1482
01:46:35,360 --> 01:46:38,511
Thank you for moving forward
in such an orderly manner.

1483
01:46:38,560 --> 01:46:40,551
'It'll be warmer for you this way,

1484
01:46:40,600 --> 01:46:44,070
'and also it'll help us in
controlling the plane during landing.

1485
01:46:44,120 --> 01:46:48,352
'You know we've had trouble - bad
trouble. I won't try to minimise it.

1486
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:52,871
'We've all gone through an experience
that none of us has ever had before.

1487
01:46:52,920 --> 01:46:56,071
'Thank God we have come through.

1488
01:46:56,120 --> 01:46:58,270
'We have the aeroplane under control.

1489
01:46:58,320 --> 01:47:00,788
'We estimate landing
in about 25 minutes.

1490
01:47:00,840 --> 01:47:04,469
'I won't kid you. We still
have a few problems ahead of us.

1491
01:47:04,520 --> 01:47:07,637
'There are two thoughts
that should comfort you.

1492
01:47:07,680 --> 01:47:11,559
'First, you're in one of the
best-constructed planes there is.'

1493
01:47:11,600 --> 01:47:16,276
Second, tonight, instead of one
experienced captain, you have two -

1494
01:47:16,320 --> 01:47:18,356
Captain Harris and myself.

1495
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:22,154
'Between us, we have more flying
years than we like to think about.'

1496
01:47:22,200 --> 01:47:25,875
I'll give you something for
the pain, but don't move your head.

1497
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:30,152
Later on, Second Officer Jordan will
instruct you on landing procedure.

1498
01:47:30,200 --> 01:47:32,191
Please do exactly as he says and...

1499
01:47:32,240 --> 01:47:35,312
I promise you we'll all come
through this together safely.

1500
01:47:35,360 --> 01:47:37,316
Thank you.

1501
01:47:50,680 --> 01:47:52,671
Global Two, Cleveland Centre.

1502
01:47:52,720 --> 01:47:55,359
Lincoln advises
runway two-niner still closed.

1503
01:47:55,400 --> 01:47:59,712
They are attempting to clear, but
failing that, plan landing on 2-2.

1504
01:48:00,840 --> 01:48:02,637
Roger.

1505
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:08,390
- Want me to take over for a while?
- Yeah, thanks.

1506
01:48:17,960 --> 01:48:20,315
Ground, Mobile One.

1507
01:48:20,360 --> 01:48:22,271
Yes, Mel.

1508
01:48:22,320 --> 01:48:25,790
Tell the chief to take a position
between runway two-niner and 2-2

1509
01:48:25,840 --> 01:48:27,831
so they can move either way.

1510
01:48:27,880 --> 01:48:30,440
- We'll notify which runway later.
- 'Roger.'

1511
01:48:35,840 --> 01:48:38,308
Turn left, heading 2-0-5.

1512
01:48:38,400 --> 01:48:41,597
At pilot's discretion,
descend and maintain 6,000.

1513
01:48:41,640 --> 01:48:43,915
Report leaving one-zero-thousand.

1514
01:48:43,960 --> 01:48:48,317
Global Two, turning left, heading
2-0-5. Leaving one-zero-thousand now.

1515
01:48:52,320 --> 01:48:55,118
Mr Jordan said you wanted
to see me again, Captain.

1516
01:48:55,160 --> 01:48:58,675
We radioed ahead, and they'll
have all the equipment you asked for.

1517
01:48:58,720 --> 01:49:01,109
Good. You'd better call again.

1518
01:49:01,160 --> 01:49:05,438
See if the airport doctor can have
an ophthalmic surgeon standing by.

1519
01:49:05,480 --> 01:49:07,755
- For Miss Meighen?
- Yes.

1520
01:49:07,800 --> 01:49:11,918
Besides her other injuries I'm afraid
her right eye has splinters.

1521
01:49:11,960 --> 01:49:15,191
Whether they're wood or metal,
I have no way of knowing.

1522
01:49:15,240 --> 01:49:17,310
Her left eye seems is unharmed.

1523
01:49:17,360 --> 01:49:19,954
Of course, it's too early
to draw conclusions.

1524
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:23,356
Modern ophthalmic surgery
can do extraordinary things.

1525
01:49:23,400 --> 01:49:25,709
- I'd better get back to her...
- Doctor.

1526
01:49:25,760 --> 01:49:30,629
Gwen... Miss Meighen...
she... she... she's pregnant.

1527
01:49:30,680 --> 01:49:33,148
- Does that make a difference?
- I can't tell.

1528
01:49:33,200 --> 01:49:35,509
Her pregnancy can't be
very far advanced.

1529
01:49:35,600 --> 01:49:37,318
No, it isn't.

1530
01:49:37,360 --> 01:49:42,229
She wasn't deprived of oxygen long
enough to harm the child. No one was.

1531
01:49:42,280 --> 01:49:45,590
If there are no abdominal injuries
and she survives,

1532
01:49:45,640 --> 01:49:49,872
chances are fair to good that
the baby should be born normally.

1533
01:49:53,880 --> 01:49:58,908
Global Two leaving. Advise Lincoln
doctor ophthalmic surgeon required.

1534
01:49:58,960 --> 01:50:01,155
'Roger, Global Two.'

1535
01:50:01,200 --> 01:50:03,191
I'll take over now.

1536
01:50:04,760 --> 01:50:08,355
Vern, I guess you know
how badly I feel about Gwen.

1537
01:50:08,400 --> 01:50:11,392
What's between you two,
that's none of my business.

1538
01:50:11,440 --> 01:50:14,318
But if there's anything
I can do, as a friend...

1539
01:50:15,680 --> 01:50:17,671
You already have.

1540
01:50:23,160 --> 01:50:25,116
Mobile One, Ground Control.

1541
01:50:25,160 --> 01:50:26,832
Yes, Doug. This is Mel.

1542
01:50:26,880 --> 01:50:30,031
Cleveland just handed off
flight two to Chicago Centre.

1543
01:50:30,080 --> 01:50:34,153
The transmissions aren't exactly
regulation. Captain's blowing a fuse.

1544
01:50:34,200 --> 01:50:37,033
I'd like to monitor.
What's the frequency?

1545
01:50:37,120 --> 01:50:39,190
'117.1.'

1546
01:50:42,800 --> 01:50:47,078
We need answers, not questions.
Are you guys sleeping down there?

1547
01:50:47,120 --> 01:50:49,839
Why aren't we getting any action?
We need help.

1548
01:50:49,880 --> 01:50:52,997
Global Two, this is
the Chicago Centre supervisor.

1549
01:50:53,040 --> 01:50:55,554
Please understand
we're doing all we can.

1550
01:50:55,600 --> 01:50:59,434
We're giving you priority.
What type of approach do you wish?

1551
01:50:59,480 --> 01:51:01,869
Chicago Supervisor, listen carefully.

1552
01:51:01,920 --> 01:51:06,277
Any approach is no good if it ends
on runway 2-2. We need two-niner.

1553
01:51:06,320 --> 01:51:08,914
We've got an unserviceable
stabiliser trim,

1554
01:51:08,960 --> 01:51:11,758
doubtful rudder control
and structural damage.

1555
01:51:11,800 --> 01:51:16,078
If we come in on 2-2, there'll be a
broken plane and lots of dead people.

1556
01:51:16,120 --> 01:51:18,953
You call Lincoln, mister,
and turn the screws.

1557
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:22,356
Tell that Lincoln airport manager
to get off his penguin butt

1558
01:51:22,400 --> 01:51:24,231
and clear that runway.

1559
01:51:28,480 --> 01:51:31,153
Snow Desk, Mobile One.

1560
01:51:31,200 --> 01:51:33,236
This is Snow Desk. Go ahead, Mel.

1561
01:51:33,280 --> 01:51:36,590
Danny, listen carefully.
Break the conga line.

1562
01:51:36,640 --> 01:51:39,438
Send the heavy ploughs
across to two-niner.

1563
01:51:39,480 --> 01:51:42,153
Head for stuck aeroplane
and await instructions.

1564
01:51:42,200 --> 01:51:44,077
Roger.

1565
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:47,797
Conga Leader, Snow Desk.

1566
01:52:10,800 --> 01:52:14,554
That's it, on this side. Get it
as close under the wheel as possible.

1567
01:52:14,640 --> 01:52:17,473
Give it a whack on the other side.

1568
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:37,231
Keep monitoring Chicago Centre
and Ground Control.

1569
01:52:37,280 --> 01:52:40,431
If you hear anything I should know,
honk the horn.

1570
01:52:45,160 --> 01:52:48,630
- What's with the ploughs?
- If you can't move it, they will.

1571
01:52:48,680 --> 01:52:52,150
Shove an undamaged aeroplane
with snowploughs? Are you crazy?

1572
01:52:52,240 --> 01:52:55,949
- No, but I'm out of runways.
- Think of what this baby costs.

1573
01:52:56,000 --> 01:53:00,278
I'm thinking of that planeload.
This runway's their only hope.

1574
01:53:00,320 --> 01:53:02,311
If those snowploughs rip it apart,

1575
01:53:02,360 --> 01:53:05,113
you'll have chunks
of fuselage all over the runway.

1576
01:53:05,160 --> 01:53:07,230
It's a chance I've got to take.

1577
01:53:07,280 --> 01:53:09,271
OK.

1578
01:53:09,320 --> 01:53:13,074
But keep those Dinky toys away
from this aeroplane for 15 minutes.

1579
01:53:13,120 --> 01:53:14,997
Maybe less. I'll drive it out.

1580
01:53:15,040 --> 01:53:17,395
Joe, let's get one thing straight.

1581
01:53:17,440 --> 01:53:20,955
When the tower tells us
we're out of time, no arguments.

1582
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,912
The ploughs will move on my order.

1583
01:53:26,880 --> 01:53:30,350
Get everybody and everything
out of the way! We're startin' up!

1584
01:53:30,400 --> 01:53:32,960
And get me somebody
that's cockpit qualified.

1585
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:34,877
All right, we're clearin' out!

1586
01:53:34,920 --> 01:53:37,912
And Chicago Centre expects
to hand over in 12 minutes.

1587
01:53:37,960 --> 01:53:41,669
Then our approach control
will have the flight for ten minutes.

1588
01:53:41,720 --> 01:53:45,269
- They say touchdown at 1:28.
- That's less time than we figured.

1589
01:53:45,360 --> 01:53:47,476
The choice of runway
will have to be made

1590
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:49,909
no later than five minutes
before landing.

1591
01:53:49,960 --> 01:53:53,430
After that, they'll be committed.
They can't turn them.

1592
01:53:53,480 --> 01:53:56,153
- What now?
- We get out of the way and wait.

1593
01:54:05,880 --> 01:54:08,348
Holding 6,000 on heading 2-0-5.

1594
01:54:08,440 --> 01:54:10,829
What's the status on
runway two-niner?

1595
01:54:10,920 --> 01:54:14,276
- No change. We'll keep you advised.
- Roger.

1596
01:54:16,800 --> 01:54:18,677
'Mobile One, Snow Desk.'

1597
01:54:20,160 --> 01:54:22,515
- Go ahead, Danny.
- 'Equipment in position.

1598
01:54:22,560 --> 01:54:24,915
'Standing by, ready to move.'

1599
01:54:29,400 --> 01:54:31,516
Roger, but be clear about one thing.

1600
01:54:31,560 --> 01:54:34,438
If the ploughs go in,
I'll give the order. No one else.

1601
01:54:34,480 --> 01:54:36,311
Right. Better you than me.

1602
01:54:36,360 --> 01:54:38,715
They'll do a real hatchet job
on that plane.

1603
01:54:38,760 --> 01:54:41,115
Then the owners
will do the same to you.

1604
01:54:41,160 --> 01:54:44,470
Maybe if the owners were on the
plane, they might agree with me.

1605
01:54:44,520 --> 01:54:48,354
- 'Roger. Standing by.'
- 'Mobile One, Ground Control.'

1606
01:54:48,400 --> 01:54:52,279
The centre estimates handoff
to Lincoln Approach Control at 1-7.

1607
01:54:52,320 --> 01:54:54,754
This gives you 11 minutes
to make a decisión.

1608
01:54:54,800 --> 01:54:57,872
I'll need to be kept informed
of exact status of flight.

1609
01:54:57,920 --> 01:55:00,639
- Can we hold this frequency clear?
- Affirmative.

1610
01:55:00,680 --> 01:55:03,114
Regular traffic's
on another frequency.

1611
01:55:03,160 --> 01:55:06,994
Can you also put stuck 707
on same frequency so I can monitor?

1612
01:55:07,040 --> 01:55:10,237
- 'Roger.'
- May I speak directly to Patroni?

1613
01:55:10,280 --> 01:55:12,157
That's OK.

1614
01:55:15,760 --> 01:55:18,115
Approach Control,
who's taking the handoff?

1615
01:55:18,160 --> 01:55:20,196
Frank has the east arrivals.

1616
01:55:21,880 --> 01:55:26,112
Continental 73, due to emergency,
continue to hold at Joliet.

1617
01:55:26,160 --> 01:55:28,071
Maintain 8,000.

1618
01:55:28,120 --> 01:55:30,953
The centre will hand off Global Two
in three minutes.

1619
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:35,232
He's all yours. We'll take
everything else off your hands.

1620
01:55:35,280 --> 01:55:37,316
I'll give you the runway
when we know.

1621
01:55:37,360 --> 01:55:38,759
Right.

1622
01:55:48,080 --> 01:55:50,913
OK, son, let's get goin'.

1623
01:55:56,560 --> 01:55:58,949
Ready to start. Pressurise.

1624
01:56:05,440 --> 01:56:07,237
Light on number three.

1625
01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:21,831
30 miles east of the airport,

1626
01:56:21,880 --> 01:56:25,634
contact Lincoln Approach Control,
one-one-eight-point-niner.

1627
01:56:25,680 --> 01:56:27,591
- Good luck.
- Roger.

1628
01:56:27,640 --> 01:56:30,234
Lincoln Approach, Global Two.

1629
01:56:30,280 --> 01:56:33,272
Global Two,
Lincoln Approach Control.

1630
01:56:33,320 --> 01:56:35,675
We're still hoping
for runway two-niner.

1631
01:56:35,720 --> 01:56:38,075
We should know
in three to five minutes.

1632
01:56:38,120 --> 01:56:40,350
Roger, Lincoln. Keep us advised.

1633
01:56:40,400 --> 01:56:43,710
Global Two, 25 miles
east of outer marker.

1634
01:56:43,760 --> 01:56:45,751
Turn right, heading 2-6-0.

1635
01:56:45,800 --> 01:56:48,633
Begin descent
at your discretion to 2,000.

1636
01:57:10,080 --> 01:57:12,958
Mr Patroni, she won't take much more.

1637
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:15,275
Well, anyway she's gonna get it.

1638
01:57:23,520 --> 01:57:26,990
Joe, the ploughs are moving!
Shut down and hold on!

1639
01:57:27,040 --> 01:57:29,918
'Joe Patroni, do you read me?
Acknowledge! '

1640
01:57:31,840 --> 01:57:33,239
Joe, shut down!

1641
01:57:33,280 --> 01:57:36,078
'Mr Patroni, don't you hear?
We have to shut down! '

1642
01:57:36,120 --> 01:57:39,635
I can't hear, there's too
much noise. We're goin' for broke!

1643
01:58:08,240 --> 01:58:11,198
The instruction book
said that was impossible.

1644
01:58:11,240 --> 01:58:15,552
That's one nice thing about the 707
- it can do everything but read.

1645
01:58:23,480 --> 01:58:24,708
Light up two-niner.

1646
01:58:31,360 --> 01:58:34,318
Obstructing aircraft
removed from two-niner.

1647
01:58:34,360 --> 01:58:37,272
- I'm inspecting for debris.
- 'Roger. Standing by.'

1648
01:58:42,480 --> 01:58:44,471
Runway two-niner clear and open.

1649
01:58:44,520 --> 01:58:47,353
Global Two, turn right,
heading 2-8-5.

1650
01:58:47,440 --> 01:58:49,237
Runway two-niner is now open.

1651
01:58:49,280 --> 01:58:52,955
Roger, Lincoln.
You've just freed the slaves again.

1652
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:55,878
- Request PAR approach.
- Global Two. Roger.

1653
01:58:55,920 --> 01:58:59,230
This will be a precisión radar
approach to runway two-niner.

1654
01:58:59,280 --> 01:59:02,590
Stand by. We'll pick you up
on the other scope.

1655
01:59:04,560 --> 01:59:07,074
- How's it handling?
- Ah, real sluggish.

1656
01:59:07,120 --> 01:59:08,997
What was that?

1657
01:59:09,080 --> 01:59:11,878
A bump!
Now shut up and move over.

1658
01:59:19,320 --> 01:59:21,470
One bounce, we might lose the tail.

1659
01:59:22,640 --> 01:59:25,393
Heads down!
Keep your arms under the pillows!

1660
01:59:25,440 --> 01:59:27,795
We're landing at Lincoln! Landing!

1661

Heads down!

1662
01:59:33,640 --> 01:59:36,996
We're gonna crash! We're gonna
be killed! We're all gonna be...

1663

Get that lady a chair.

An ophthalmic surgeon is standing by.
Any other complications?

1748

She has a fractured arm.
They'll probably use a general.

1749
02:07:02,240 --> 02:07:04,754
But before they decide
on the anaesthesia,

1750
02:07:04,800 --> 02:07:06,791
tell them that she's pregnant.

1751
02:07:06,840 --> 02:07:08,592
Here she comes.

1752
02:07:15,920 --> 02:07:18,753
It's all right, Captain.
We'll take care of her.

1753
02:07:18,800 --> 02:07:21,155
I'm going to the hospital with her.

1754
02:07:43,760 --> 02:07:45,716
Nice goin', sweetheart.

1755

a thank-you note to Mr Boeing.

Good morning. First class or economy?

1757
02:08:05,320 --> 02:08:07,311
First class.

1758
02:08:11,080 --> 02:08:14,914
You know, it was
much more fun the other way.

1759
02:08:16,520 --> 02:08:18,511
I'm too keyed up to sleep.

1760
02:08:18,560 --> 02:08:22,519
- What about some breakfast?
- Sounds good. Where should we go?

1761
02:08:22,560 --> 02:08:26,439
Your apartment. You've been bragging
about your scrambled eggs.

1762
02:08:26,480 --> 02:08:29,119
It's time I found out
how good they really are.

Mr Bakersfeld.
Maintenance just called.

The big snow blower's got damage.

1765
02:08:36,400 --> 02:08:39,358
Mike wants to know whether to work
overtime to repair 'em.

1766
02:08:39,400 --> 02:08:41,470
Tell him to take care of it himself.

1767
02:08:41,520 --> 02:08:43,556
Yes, sir.
