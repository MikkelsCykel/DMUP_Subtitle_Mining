[woman] Reesa from Manhattan,
you're on the air.

2
00:00:17,541 --> 00:00:20,101
<i>[woman 2] I date a lot of guys.
I mean, a lot.</i>

3
00:00:20,261 --> 00:00:23,107
<i>I've had more blind dates than a
seeing eye dog. You know why?</i>

4
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,417
<i>- I'm on tenterhooks, shoot.
- I'm looking for the real thing</i>

5
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,730
<i>you're talking about,
but I wanna feel love.</i>

6
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:32,336
<i>The kind where you're so delirious
you can barely breathe or eat.</i>

7
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:36,014
<i>I'm waiting for Prince Charming who
will pick me up, sweep me off my feet,</i>

8
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:39,967
<i>- slam me into a wall, and bang my...
- Let me stop you right there, Reesa.</i>

9
00:00:40,139 --> 00:00:43,017
First, I don't think love
is supposed to deny you of your food

10
00:00:43,179 --> 00:00:46,807
or oxygen supply.
Love is supposed to nourish you.

11
00:00:46,978 --> 00:00:49,367
<i>Well, I'm just saying
I want the fairy tale.</i>

12
00:00:49,538 --> 00:00:51,893
<i>I want the excitement, the romance,
you know?</i>

13
00:00:52,058 --> 00:00:55,846
Yeah, I do. This Prince Charming
of yours doesn't exist.

14
00:00:56,018 --> 00:00:57,894
He's good for a few nights in the sack,

15
00:00:58,057 --> 00:01:00,651
but his charm will run thin,
which is what charm does.

16
00:01:00,817 --> 00:01:04,412
<i>Well, I hear ya, Dr Lloyd, but what
I'm saying is that I want to be deeply</i>

17
00:01:04,577 --> 00:01:07,887
<i>- and passionately in love.
- You want to be passionately in love.</i>

18
00:01:08,057 --> 00:01:11,731
I see. You know who's a bigger flake
than your buddy, Prince Charming?

19
00:01:11,896 --> 00:01:15,172
His brother, Prince Passion.
Reesa, if you are truly serious

20
00:01:15,336 --> 00:01:18,055
about wanting to find real
and lasting love in this town,

21
00:01:18,216 --> 00:01:20,445
I'm gonna have to dish out
tough love to you now.

22
00:01:20,615 --> 00:01:22,571
<i>- Uh-oh.
- This serial dating of yours</i>

23
00:01:22,735 --> 00:01:26,205
is a waste of time. You can't
find something when you don't know

24
00:01:26,375 --> 00:01:29,208
what you're looking for.
You're playing the field, right?

25
00:01:29,375 --> 00:01:34,243
Hoping that somebody will want you,
when it's you who needs to figure out

26
00:01:34,414 --> 00:01:37,451
what it is you want.
Anybody can fall in love,

27
00:01:37,614 --> 00:01:41,732
but what you deserve is a man with
the emotional maturity to stay in love.

28
00:01:41,894 --> 00:01:46,205
Don't settle for a boyfriend
when you can demand a manfriend.

29
00:01:46,373 --> 00:01:48,204
<i>I'm not really the demanding type.</i>

30
00:01:48,373 --> 00:01:50,125
Don't go there, Reesa.

31
00:01:50,293 --> 00:01:52,045
Hear what she's doing, listeners?

32
00:01:52,213 --> 00:01:55,888
That is the sound of a woman
who settles for second-best.

33
00:01:56,053 --> 00:01:59,522
Why do we do that? I mean,
deep down we know we deserve better,

34
00:01:59,692 --> 00:02:02,604
so why do we keep lowering
our standards?

35
00:02:02,772 --> 00:02:05,491
<i>I devote a chapter
to this in my new book, Real Love,</i>

36
00:02:05,652 --> 00:02:07,051
which come to stores on Wednesday.

37
00:02:07,212 --> 00:02:11,807
I've finally learned that unless
you demand real love for yourself,

38
00:02:11,971 --> 00:02:14,087
you're going to get
seriously hurt out there.

39
00:02:14,251 --> 00:02:16,719
<i>But how am I supposed to know
if love is real or not?</i>

40
00:02:16,891 --> 00:02:20,849
Spell it out for yourselves.
R: is he responsible?

41
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:24,844
- [men shouting]
- E: is he your equal?

42
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:28,764
- A: is he an adult?
- Are you freakin' blind? [shouting]

43
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:32,365
- And most of all, L: is he loving?
- That's a ridiculous call!

44
00:02:32,529 --> 00:02:36,761
<i>- Know anybody like that?
- [Reesa] Not really.</i>

45
00:02:36,929 --> 00:02:40,558
Hold out for it, Reesa.
You'll be so glad you did.

46
00:02:40,729 --> 00:02:43,765
<i>Oh, Dr Lloyd, you are such a lifesaver.
Thank you so much.</i>

47
00:02:43,928 --> 00:02:45,964
You're welcome.
All right, next caller.

48
00:02:46,128 --> 00:02:48,688
- [man] Patrick! Come on!
- [Patrick] Where'd she go?

49
00:02:48,848 --> 00:02:53,478
Hopefully, she went to buy you a muzzle.
Keep your mouth quiet next time.

50
00:02:53,648 --> 00:02:56,207
- Move it, move it.
- If there is a next time.

51
00:02:56,367 --> 00:02:59,723
- [music plays on radio]
- [man] Showtunes.

52
00:02:59,887 --> 00:03:02,799
- [changing radio station]
- Showtunes.

53
00:03:02,967 --> 00:03:04,958
- More showtunes.
- I like showtunes!

54
00:03:05,127 --> 00:03:08,243
- Obviously. It's sad.
- Oh, there's the love doctor.

55
00:03:08,406 --> 00:03:10,476
- I hate that lady.
- My lady loves this.

56
00:03:10,646 --> 00:03:12,398
- Mine, too.
- Your... your who?

57
00:03:12,566 --> 00:03:14,841
- I mean my mother.
- [laughter]

58
00:03:15,006 --> 00:03:17,440
- What is that?
- You're a beast.

59
00:03:17,606 --> 00:03:21,644
Next caller.
Sofia of Astoria, you're on the air.

60
00:03:21,805 --> 00:03:25,002
- Hi. Hi, am I on?
- Yeah. Yeah, here we are. Let's go.

61
00:03:25,165 --> 00:03:29,875
I'm supposed to be getting married this
weekend, and I'm having second thoughts.

62
00:03:30,045 --> 00:03:33,719
<i>- Second, third, fourth?
- What do you mean?</i>

63
00:03:33,884 --> 00:03:35,920
Thinking about calling
this off a while?

64
00:03:36,084 --> 00:03:40,157
<i>Well, I took your online compatibility
test, and I scored a 12.</i>

65
00:03:40,324 --> 00:03:43,679
OK. That test helps predict
long-term compatibility, caller.

66
00:03:43,843 --> 00:03:46,232
<i>- You're right to consider this...
- Sofia?</i>

67
00:03:46,403 --> 00:03:48,359
<i>...very, very carefully.</i>

68
00:03:48,523 --> 00:03:51,879
Forty-three per cent
of marriages end in divorce.

69
00:03:52,043 --> 00:03:55,114
All right? You don't want that.
How long have you known this guy?

70
00:03:55,282 --> 00:03:58,160
About five months, but he's
a really good guy and all, and...

71
00:03:58,322 --> 00:04:00,711
[stammering] But... but... five months?

72
00:04:00,882 --> 00:04:05,000
<i>Sofia, are you scared of being alone?</i>

73
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:08,312
<i>- I guess so, maybe, yeah.
- 'Cause you know what's scarier</i>

74
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:11,041
<i>than being alone?
You know what's worse?</i>

75
00:04:11,201 --> 00:04:15,592
<i>Being alone with the wrong guy
for the rest of your life. You got it?</i>

76
00:04:15,761 --> 00:04:18,070
Doesn't sound like
an average case of jitters.

77
00:04:18,241 --> 00:04:20,879
Wait, are you saying
I should call off the wedding?

78
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,875
<i>I'm running out of time, caller,
but you know, deep inside,</i>

79
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,635
<i>what you need to do.
Thank you for calling.</i>

80
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,357
<i>Good luck.</i>

81
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:43,311
- [groans]
- Knock-knock.

82
00:04:43,478 --> 00:04:46,117
- Mm, who's there?
- This is your publisher speaking.

83
00:04:46,278 --> 00:04:51,227
- Mm, we don't want any.
- Read 'em and weep.

84
00:04:51,398 --> 00:04:55,231
- Oh, really?
- There's only one way to find out.

85
00:04:55,397 --> 00:04:58,036
No, no. I'm too nervous.
You read it.

86
00:04:58,197 --> 00:05:01,587

- "The doctor is in.

khoja of modern romance. "

89
00:05:09,276 --> 00:05:12,393
- Latest what? What did they call me?
- Khoja, apparently.

90
00:05:12,556 --> 00:05:15,548
I don't know what that means.
I don't know how to spell it.

91
00:05:15,716 --> 00:05:18,105
- K-H...
- What kind of word is khoja?

92
00:05:18,275 --> 00:05:20,743
...O...
- It's just showing off, really.

93
00:05:20,915 --> 00:05:23,634
- OK.
- [laughs] For a popular magazine

94
00:05:23,795 --> 00:05:27,424
to review a self-help book
and pull out a word like "khoja",

95
00:05:27,595 --> 00:05:31,826
<i>"from the Turkish 'hoca':
A, a title of respect for teacher.</i>

- Or woman.

97
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:37,468
Oh! Or "C, a sub-sect

- I don't know.

100
00:05:44,113 --> 00:05:46,832
The assassin thing,
I wouldn't throw that out.

Mm. I love fruit.

Yeah, well, that's

[laughs] We're not done.
We're not done with comments...

dos and don'ts is both insightful

- Trenchant! What does that mean?

110
00:06:13,391 --> 00:06:16,303
Is that some kind of fancy word
for "full of shit?" Trenchant?

you plunge a knife through my heart.

No, no, no, not you, sir.

00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:20,894
I'm just running away from many more
appropriate men who pursue me.

145
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,051
<i>- Because...
- Afraid of the real thing?</i>

146
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,209
<i>So they say.</i>

147
00:08:44,818 --> 00:08:48,288
- There's Patrick!
- Oh, Patrick!

148
00:08:48,338 --> 00:08:52,092
- Patrick...
- Quiet! Leave the man alone.

149
00:08:52,258 --> 00:08:54,725
Can you not see
that his heart is broken?

150
00:08:56,177 --> 00:09:00,216
How can he eat when the woman
that he loved abandoned him forever,

151
00:09:00,377 --> 00:09:04,369
virtually without explanation
and may be, at this very moment,

152
00:09:04,536 --> 00:09:07,892
cuckolding him with some other man.

153
00:09:11,896 --> 00:09:12,885
[laughs]

154
00:09:15,816 --> 00:09:20,889
- [Patrick] Good night, everybody.
- [woman] Cuckolding? What's that mean?

155
00:09:51,932 --> 00:09:54,446
- Hey.
- I'll be right with you.

156
00:09:54,612 --> 00:09:57,888
I'm giving Ann Coulter's
frequent flyer miles to Michael Moore.

157
00:09:58,052 --> 00:10:00,691
Ajay, come on, man.
This hacking's getting out of hand.

158
00:10:00,852 --> 00:10:04,730
- You can get into serious trouble.
- Too late. Bon voyage, Mr Moore.

159
00:10:04,891 --> 00:10:07,041
See the clipping
on love doctor's wedding?

160
00:10:07,211 --> 00:10:09,327
Who in their right mind
is gonna marry her?

161
00:10:09,491 --> 00:10:12,244
- Whoever we want.
- What do you mean?

162
00:10:12,411 --> 00:10:14,367
Check this out.

163
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:19,242
- Who's that?
- That's her.

164
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,447
- The love doctor?
- I got it off her birth certificate.

165
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:26,683
- Oh, I don't know about this, Ajay.
- What are you talking about?

166
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:30,478
All you ever do is walk around muttering
about giving her a piece of your mind

167
00:10:30,649 --> 00:10:33,004
or letting her have it
or fixing her wagon.

168
00:10:33,169 --> 00:10:35,478
OK, for one, I've never said,
"Fix her wagon. "

169
00:10:35,649 --> 00:10:38,163
If you've moved on, that's different,

170
00:10:38,329 --> 00:10:40,967
and I'm happy you
finally put this behind you.

171
00:10:41,128 --> 00:10:42,686
Wait, whoa.

172
00:10:44,768 --> 00:10:48,920
Maybe me tellin' her how I feel
and holdin' her accountable would be,

173
00:10:49,088 --> 00:10:52,318
you know, important for my growth
or whatever. What do you think?

174
00:10:52,487 --> 00:10:56,719
What am I, your yogi? I thought
you just wanted a little payback.

175
00:11:01,447 --> 00:11:02,721
- Let's do it.
- Nice.

176
00:11:03,646 --> 00:11:05,079
<i>- [beeps]
- Oh, no.</i>

177
00:11:05,246 --> 00:11:07,157
Now you're married.

178
00:11:07,326 --> 00:11:08,759
I'm married. [laughs]

179
00:11:08,926 --> 00:11:12,521
- [Emma] I'm what?
- Already married.

180
00:11:12,686 --> 00:11:15,041
- According to who?
- "According to whom. "

181
00:11:15,205 --> 00:11:17,321
- The state of New York.
- That's impossible.

182
00:11:17,485 --> 00:11:22,115
- I have never been married.
- You must have the wrong Emma Lloyd.

183
00:11:22,285 --> 00:11:26,278
- Emmaline Willing Lloyd?
- [laughs]

184
00:11:26,445 --> 00:11:28,196
Your real name is Emmaline?

185
00:11:28,364 --> 00:11:30,275
A lot of things
you don't know about her.

186
00:11:30,444 --> 00:11:34,323
- How do we fix this?
- Annulment forms. Fill them out.

187
00:11:34,484 --> 00:11:36,634
Have them notarised. Bring them back.

188
00:11:37,604 --> 00:11:40,754
- I can't believe I didn't know.
- Your husband needs to sign them.

189
00:11:40,923 --> 00:11:42,595
- Fiancé.
- Husband.

190
00:11:42,763 --> 00:11:46,392
- I don't have a husband.
- Then who is Patrick Thomas Sullivan

191
00:11:46,563 --> 00:11:48,315
- of Astoria, New York?
- Who is he?

192
00:11:48,483 --> 00:11:50,713
- [whispers] I don't know.
- He's your husband.

193
00:11:50,882 --> 00:11:53,635
His address is right there.

194
00:11:53,802 --> 00:11:55,201
- Astoria?
- Queens.

195
00:11:55,362 --> 00:11:57,512
I know a lawyer
who can sort this out quietly.

196
00:11:57,682 --> 00:12:01,038
- I'm sure that won't be necessary.
- It will. I've got a book to launch.

197
00:12:01,202 --> 00:12:02,396
Yours, I might add.

198
00:12:02,562 --> 00:12:05,029
- You don't think I was married.
- No. It's not that.

199
00:12:05,201 --> 00:12:07,590
It's just the timing
of this could not be worse.

200
00:12:07,761 --> 00:12:10,321
- I know.
- I'm recalling 70,000 copies

201
00:12:10,481 --> 00:12:13,075
of a moving memoir
by a new author that we've trumpeted

202
00:12:13,241 --> 00:12:16,755
as the next Maya Angelou who turns out
to have plagiarised... Guess who?

203
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,150
...Maya Angelou.
- I forgot about that one.

204
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,880
I didn't. The headline
"Love Doctor: A polygamist"

205
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,555
- just flashed before my eyes.
- Hold these.

206
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,028
On top of everything,
Bollenbecker take-over.

207
00:12:28,199 --> 00:12:31,430
They haven't announced which publishers
they'll keep and dump.

208
00:12:31,599 --> 00:12:34,272
So one self-help author
who can't seem to help herself

209
00:12:34,439 --> 00:12:37,397
from being married,
Abdington Books could be history.

210
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:40,755
I understand completely. Trust me.
I'll take care of it.

211
00:12:40,918 --> 00:12:45,673
Everything will be fine...
Oh, no, darling. Naughty choc-y.

212
00:12:48,918 --> 00:12:52,910
- You don't need this.
- You're right. Moment of weakness.

213
00:12:54,717 --> 00:12:58,505
- Go get 'em.
- Taxi! Bye, sweetie.

214
00:13:37,394 --> 00:13:39,384
[Emma] Hello?

215
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:42,391
Hello?

216
00:13:47,873 --> 00:13:49,942
[laughs] Hello? Excuse me?

217
00:13:50,112 --> 00:13:52,580
You're not Patrick Sullivan, are you?

218
00:13:52,752 --> 00:13:56,381
- You are? No.
- May I help you?

219
00:13:56,552 --> 00:14:00,784
- I hope so. Is this 230133rd Street?
- Yes. It is.

220
00:14:00,952 --> 00:14:04,580
I'm looking for someone who lives here
by the unlikely name, Patrick Sullivan.

221
00:14:04,751 --> 00:14:08,380
- Patrick.
- [speaking foreign language]

222
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:14,986
Keep going, tall lady! Keep going!

223
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:26,381
Excuse me?

224
00:14:26,549 --> 00:14:30,383
Excuse me, sir? Officer?

225
00:14:31,789 --> 00:14:33,586
- Hello!
- [yelling]

226
00:14:33,749 --> 00:14:36,547
- [screaming]
- Hey. Hey, I'm sorry...

227
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:41,145
No, no, no! That's fine. Um, can you
tell me how I can find Patrick Sullivan?

228
00:14:49,827 --> 00:14:52,785
- We couldn't get that lady out.
- She weighed 500 pounds!

229
00:14:52,827 --> 00:14:55,739
- She knocked you with her skillet.
- Frying pan.

230
00:14:55,907 --> 00:14:57,659
- Patrick?
- Yeah. Ah!

231
00:14:57,827 --> 00:15:00,102
You won't believe this.
That home-wrecking lady

232
00:15:00,267 --> 00:15:01,824
from the radio walked in here.

233
00:15:01,986 --> 00:15:03,783
- I believe you.
- Can I help you?

234
00:15:03,946 --> 00:15:06,414
- What's she doin'?
- Looking for Patrick Sullivan.

235
00:15:06,586 --> 00:15:09,384
- I was told he might be here.
- Right over there.

236
00:15:09,546 --> 00:15:11,537
- She looked over.
- What are you havin'?

237
00:15:11,706 --> 00:15:14,742
- Um, whatever he's having.
- I'll bring it right over.

238
00:15:14,905 --> 00:15:16,941
It's walkin' right this way.

239
00:15:17,105 --> 00:15:19,494
- It's takin' its coat off.
- How do you do?

240
00:15:19,665 --> 00:15:23,135
It just looked at me again.
It's comin' over here.

241
00:15:23,305 --> 00:15:26,216
It's comin' right for me.
What does it want?

242
00:15:28,384 --> 00:15:31,217
Patrick Sullivan?
You're not an easy man to find.

243
00:15:31,384 --> 00:15:35,013
- I'm Emma Lloyd.
- It thinks I'm you. Help me out.

244
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:38,095
Hey, I, uh... I dropped my chalk.
I'm Patrick Sullivan.

245
00:15:38,263 --> 00:15:42,097
- This is my opponent, Larry Berlson.
- Oh! Mr Sullivan. Mr Berlson.

246
00:15:42,263 --> 00:15:44,538
How do you do?
I'm here for the oddest reason.

247
00:15:44,703 --> 00:15:46,295
- We all are.
- Here you are.

248
00:15:46,463 --> 00:15:48,260
- Mine?
- Mind if I interrupt?

249
00:15:48,423 --> 00:15:50,333
- Knock yourself out.
- I didn't mean...

250
00:15:50,502 --> 00:15:51,651
- Don't play?
- Yes.

251
00:15:51,822 --> 00:15:54,052
Then you're stripes.
Down the hatch.

252
00:15:54,222 --> 00:15:58,340
- No, no, Mr Sullivan. I'm here to...
- You don't drink? You don't play pool?

253
00:15:58,502 --> 00:16:02,892
- Perhaps I can get you an herbal tea?
- [laughter]

254
00:16:04,581 --> 00:16:06,253
Nine in the corner.

255
00:16:09,021 --> 00:16:11,012
- [all exclaim]
- We need another round.

256
00:16:11,181 --> 00:16:13,899
Mr Sullivan. Something
very unfortunate has happened,

257
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:16,972
- and it could make a mess of my life.
- I'm sorry to hear that.

258
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,495
- It's certainly not your fault.
- It's your shot.

259
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:22,697
Um, all right. [laughs]
Well, how can I explain?

260
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:26,408
You see, um, uh,
I'm about to be married.

261
00:16:26,579 --> 00:16:28,456
- [all exclaim]
- That is too bad!

262
00:16:28,619 --> 00:16:31,850
Congratulations on the other thing.
We got a bride in our midst.

263
00:16:32,019 --> 00:16:34,169
- [all shouting]
- [applause]

264
00:16:34,339 --> 00:16:36,488
Thank you. That won't be necessary.

265
00:16:36,658 --> 00:16:40,128
It's necessary. I feel a toast
coming on. Wait a second.

266
00:16:40,298 --> 00:16:42,368
- I know you.
- Excuse me?

267
00:16:42,538 --> 00:16:45,132
<i>Yeah, yeah.
Real Love With Dr Emma Lloyd.</i>

268
00:16:45,298 --> 00:16:49,131
- You're that lady I hear on the radio.
- Yes, of course. You found me out.

269
00:16:49,297 --> 00:16:52,687
- Have you ever been on television?
- Um, no, but I have a book coming out.

270
00:16:52,857 --> 00:16:55,929
- I love television.
- My girlfriend never misses your show.

271
00:16:56,097 --> 00:16:58,565
Oh, well, has it been
helpful in your relationship?

272
00:16:58,737 --> 00:17:02,695
[laughing] Oh, you have no idea.
It's completely changed our lives!

273
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:06,405
- Oh, really? That is so nice to hear.
- Yeah. Tony! Here you go.

274
00:17:06,576 --> 00:17:09,249
- To the bride and ever-changing life!
- To the bride!

275
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:12,054
[all] To the bride!

276
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:17,049
Mr Sullivan, as I was saying,
you see, I'm about to be married.

277
00:17:17,215 --> 00:17:20,571
Be careful. Forty-three per cent
of marriages end in divorce.

278
00:17:20,735 --> 00:17:23,613
That's right. It's all
about picking the right partner.

279
00:17:23,774 --> 00:17:26,732
- So true. It's so true.
- In order to do that, my fiancé,

280
00:17:26,894 --> 00:17:29,124
Richard, and I,
need a license from New York...

281
00:17:29,294 --> 00:17:33,333
- Richard from dispatch? Asshole.
- So on an otherwise lovely morning,

282
00:17:33,494 --> 00:17:35,688
- we go to city hall...
- To Emma and Richie!

283
00:17:35,853 --> 00:17:38,845
- [all cheering]
- Richard!

284
00:17:39,013 --> 00:17:41,607
- And I don't want any more.
- Hey, you're right.

285
00:17:41,773 --> 00:17:44,606
Don't want Richie to see
you hammered before your wedding.

286
00:17:44,773 --> 00:17:46,809
Tony! Give me
that herbal tea over here.

287
00:17:46,973 --> 00:17:49,770
- Herbal tea, coming up!
- [all shouting]

288
00:17:49,932 --> 00:17:54,528
- [laughs]
- Very funny, Mr Sullivan. Very funny.

- You don't?

00:17:57,252 --> 00:18:00,288
No. My father taught me a good trick
to hold one's liquor.

291
00:18:00,451 --> 00:18:03,045
You simply recite
the presidents' names in order.

- Oh! That's right!

That is exactly what
I came to talk to you about.

- OK.
- Yes, Mr Sullivan,

302
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:32,084
- it seems we're married.
- Come again?

303

We... are married!

304

- Exactly!

305
00:18:38,888 --> 00:18:40,287
- I'm over here.
- Right!

Uh, yes, it seems that we,
I mean we,

- Mm-hm. I'll say. A big one.

the same size?

Richard, sweetheart.
I am so sorry I didn't call.

a respected cake maker.

- Can I get another slice of this one?
- You've already tried the butter cream.

414

It's my fiancée. She's on the fence
about the butter cream.

- I am not.
- Have any milk?

- Yeah, absolutely. How much is this?
- It's free, sir.

Bullshit! It's free!

- No, thank you. I'm not six.

Holy crap! [laughs] Cake down.

422
00:26:33,448 --> 00:26:36,281
I need a spoon. Don't worry about it.
I got this.

423
00:26:36,448 --> 00:26:39,997
Here we have our dark Belgian chocolate
with vanilla mousse torte.

You gotta try this.

No, no, no. That's all right.
I'm not your baby. No, no, no, no, no!

- Ah! Ah!
- No!

- Mmm?
- Ah?

430
00:26:59,846 --> 00:27:04,044
- Mm. It's yummy.
- It's super-duper.

431
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:08,881
Mm-hm. Um, may I, um... may I just
have one more glass of milk, please?

432
00:27:09,045 --> 00:27:11,843
Attagirl! Milk for my bride.
In fact, milks all around.

Milks all around.

Wow! You must really like cake.

Yeah, you gotta try this,
and mix these two together.

437
00:27:21,844 --> 00:27:25,359
Hey, hey, can we get, uh, some
Ring Ding things for the gals over here?

438
00:27:25,524 --> 00:27:27,992
Darling, I am certain
everyone is being attended to.

439
00:27:28,164 --> 00:27:31,041
Baby, I got this covered.
Don't you worry about it.

440
00:27:31,203 --> 00:27:34,115
- Quite a handful you got there.
- That he is.

441
00:27:34,283 --> 00:27:38,196
Impulsive, unpredictable. You never
know what he's gonna do next.

442
00:27:38,363 --> 00:27:41,400
- Full of surprises.
- But that's the fun of it, isn't it?

443
00:27:41,563 --> 00:27:44,759
- Of course it is.
- It is, trust me.

444
00:27:44,922 --> 00:27:47,595
- Here you go, ladies.
- He reminds me of my husband

445
00:27:47,762 --> 00:27:50,993
when we first met. Everybody
thought we were a total mismatch,

446
00:27:51,162 --> 00:27:55,951
<i>but we had so much fun.
And we still do 25 years later.</i>

447
00:27:56,121 --> 00:27:58,760
Hey! What are you ladies
talkin' about over here?

448
00:27:58,921 --> 00:28:01,276
- Talking about the men in our lives.
- Ah, boys.

449
00:28:01,441 --> 00:28:04,592
- Never mind.
- How did you two meet?

450
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:09,476
Oh, honey, you tell the story.
You tell it a lot better than I do.

451
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:15,272
No, no, no, no, no. No, you tell it.
You're the good, uh, teller of it.

452
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,635
- Please?
- All right, all right. Sure.

453
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:21,508
- You ladies heard of pro wrestling?
- Stop! Kidder!

454
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:23,556
Oh, he's such a kidder. Kidder.

455
00:28:23,719 --> 00:28:26,711
It was a, um, uh... a blind date.

456
00:28:26,879 --> 00:28:29,313
- Oh?
- Yeah, yeah, we were fixed up.

457
00:28:29,479 --> 00:28:31,833
Yes! Fixed up.
But not with each other.

458
00:28:31,998 --> 00:28:35,149
It was two separate blind dates
in the same bar.

459
00:28:35,318 --> 00:28:37,149
- Both goin' terribly.
- Horribly!

460
00:28:37,318 --> 00:28:39,388
Think about those people who set us up.

461
00:28:39,558 --> 00:28:41,594
- Susie and Allen.
- Susie and Allen.

462
00:28:41,757 --> 00:28:45,670
- What the hell did they know?
- I don't know. I guess he noticed me.

463
00:28:45,837 --> 00:28:48,954
Well, I mean, come on. Look at her.

464
00:28:49,117 --> 00:28:54,110
- A guy would have to be blind.
- Noticed me suffering on my bad date,

465
00:28:54,276 --> 00:28:58,428
and then the band started playing this
song, and it was my favourite song.

466
00:28:58,596 --> 00:29:03,750
And suddenly he was next to me and
he asked me to dance, and... I said yes.

467
00:29:06,195 --> 00:29:08,231
- What was the song?
- Song?

468
00:29:08,395 --> 00:29:11,228
- Mm-hm?
- Oh, yeah, the song.

469
00:29:11,395 --> 00:29:13,829
<i>- Oh.
- ¶ Over night scenes ¶</i>

470
00:29:13,995 --> 00:29:17,146
<i>¶ Dinner and wine
Saturday girls ¶</i>

471
00:29:17,315 --> 00:29:20,431
<i>¶ I was never in love
Never had the time ¶</i>

472
00:29:20,594 --> 00:29:23,904
<i>- Honey, Every Woman in the World.
- Every Woman in the World.</i>

473
00:29:24,074 --> 00:29:26,224
<i>¶ Laughing myself to sleep ¶</i>

474
00:29:26,394 --> 00:29:30,432
<i>¶ Waking up lonely
I needed someone to hold me ¶</i>

475
00:29:30,593 --> 00:29:31,662
<i>¶ Oh, oh, oh ¶</i>

476
00:29:31,833 --> 00:29:36,861
<i>[all] ¶ Girl, you're every woman
in the world to me ¶</i>

477
00:29:37,033 --> 00:29:39,672
<i>¶ You're my fantasy ¶</i>

478
00:29:39,833 --> 00:29:43,905
<i>- ¶ You're my reality ¶
- That's it! Uh, that's the song.</i>

479
00:29:51,072 --> 00:29:53,028
That was totally
off the top of my head.

480
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:56,900
Known each other for two hours
and we already got a song.

481
00:29:57,071 --> 00:30:01,428
We don't have a song.
How long is this gonna take?

482
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:09,021
[door buzzing]

483
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:13,098
Emma Lloyd, Deepak Manaam Chaturvedi.

484
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:15,465
- Mr Manaam Chater...
- Deep. Deep.

485
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:17,347
- Mr Deep.
- I recognise you.

486
00:30:17,509 --> 00:30:19,784
The passed-out lady
Patrick carries around.

487
00:30:19,949 --> 00:30:21,667
Yes, that would be me.

488
00:30:23,269 --> 00:30:26,466
- I brought you a little something.
- Oh, how very thoughtful.

489
00:30:27,589 --> 00:30:29,579
Do we have to do this right now?

490
00:30:32,028 --> 00:30:33,541
Delicious.

491
00:30:33,708 --> 00:30:36,017
- It's not unlike a Ring Ding.
- What'd I tell you?

492
00:30:36,188 --> 00:30:38,702
I'm sure you'd really love
a glass of milk with that,

493
00:30:38,868 --> 00:30:41,301
but I have to get home
and changed for my book party.

494
00:30:41,467 --> 00:30:44,140
- If you don't mind...
- Don't rush. I'm a notary public.

495
00:30:44,307 --> 00:30:46,662
- I took a test.
- OK, I'm sorry.

496
00:30:46,827 --> 00:30:49,216
Um, how long do you
think this will take?

497
00:30:49,387 --> 00:30:51,218
Let's just review, hm?

498
00:30:52,307 --> 00:30:55,742
Signatures... check.

499
00:30:55,906 --> 00:31:00,377
Dates... check.

500
00:31:00,546 --> 00:31:03,014
My seal and you'll be
on your way in ten minutes.

501
00:31:03,186 --> 00:31:05,301
- Oh!
- An hour.

502
00:31:06,385 --> 00:31:08,296
A year.

503
00:31:08,465 --> 00:31:10,262
As long as it takes.
Who can say?

504
00:31:10,425 --> 00:31:13,303
Anything you can do to hurry?
I don't mind paying extra.

505
00:31:13,465 --> 00:31:17,821
- Trying to bribe a public official?
- Oh, this is ridiculous. I'm late!

506
00:31:17,984 --> 00:31:20,703
I'm late, and I'll send
a messenger in the morning.

507
00:31:20,864 --> 00:31:23,014
That will be more than enough time.

508
00:31:23,184 --> 00:31:26,221
- I could bring it by the office.
- Oh, no. I will send a messenger.

509
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:29,216
Thank you, Mr Sullivan,
for your co-operation.

510
00:31:29,383 --> 00:31:32,295
Well, thank you for thanking me,
Mrs Sullivan.

511
00:31:33,423 --> 00:31:35,061
- A year?
- Patrick, I'm out. Out.

512
00:31:35,223 --> 00:31:37,896
You had your fun. This is too far.
You should be ashamed.

513
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:40,815
- A nice lady like that?
- I wanted to give her a taste

514
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:44,975
of her own medicine, period.
And then I... I don't know.

515
00:31:45,142 --> 00:31:48,896
- She's starting to grow on me.
- No. Look, no growing, OK?

516
00:31:49,062 --> 00:31:52,815
No growing on anyone by anyone.
No knees weakened,

517
00:31:52,981 --> 00:31:57,930
no shines taken to, none of it.
Not on my watch.

518
00:31:58,101 --> 00:32:02,413
Now, go. You and Ajay
have caused enough trouble.

519
00:32:03,541 --> 00:32:04,859
Out!

520
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:07,011
[man] Dr Lloyd! This way, please!

521
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:09,933
Dr Lloyd? This camera, please.

522
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:13,331
- Smile, please.
- Beautiful, thank you.

523
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,297
- Hi.
- [man] Eye contact, please?

524
00:32:16,459 --> 00:32:20,532
- Sign this.
- This way, please.

525
00:32:20,699 --> 00:32:23,008
- And where's Richard?
- Right over there.

526
00:32:23,179 --> 00:32:24,658
Thanks.

527
00:32:25,579 --> 00:32:27,535
- Hi! Oh!
- Not too shabby, huh?

528
00:32:27,698 --> 00:32:30,371
- It's wonderful. I can't believe it.
- Sign these.

529
00:32:30,538 --> 00:32:31,607
OK.

530
00:32:32,538 --> 00:32:35,132
- I have so much to tell you.
- Did you get the papers?

531
00:32:35,298 --> 00:32:38,973
- Um, they're at the notary.
- Excellent. Karl Bollenbecker's here.

532
00:32:39,138 --> 00:32:40,411
- Make that out to him.
- Oh?

533
00:32:40,577 --> 00:32:43,489
He wasn't coming, then his
office said he was. Good or bad?

534
00:32:43,657 --> 00:32:45,887
How could it be bad?
He hasn't even met you.

535
00:32:46,057 --> 00:32:48,093
- You look stunning.
- Thanks.

536
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:50,691
- What happened to your head?
- Oh! Bird accident.

537
00:32:50,857 --> 00:32:53,689
A pigeon flew into me.
I'll go take care of it.

538
00:32:55,536 --> 00:32:59,245
- Emma? You remember Dr Benton?
- Yes, hi. Nice to see you. Hi, Judy.

539
00:33:05,295 --> 00:33:09,493
No sooner do we leave you then, bang,
I see your picture big on the bus.

540
00:33:09,655 --> 00:33:11,532
Oh! From the cake tasting!

541
00:33:11,695 --> 00:33:15,369
I felt so foolish, I went
and bought your book immediately.

542
00:33:15,534 --> 00:33:17,809
- Oh, that's unnecessary.
- Later I was reading

543
00:33:17,974 --> 00:33:22,013
your very sensible observation
and your clinical judgments...

544
00:33:22,174 --> 00:33:25,769
- Are they good things?
- I'm sure some people find them useful,

545
00:33:25,934 --> 00:33:29,687
but I was surprised that a helpless
romantic can give such practical advice.

546
00:33:29,853 --> 00:33:32,731
- [laughs] Me? Helpless?
- Oh, yes, you.

547
00:33:32,893 --> 00:33:35,202
Hopelessly helpless,
but let me finish.

548
00:33:35,373 --> 00:33:39,684
So my husband, Karl, returns
to the home and on top of his paper,

549
00:33:39,852 --> 00:33:44,607
there is an invitation to this
very party. Isn't it amazing?

550
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:46,888
When you say Karl,
do you mean Karl...

551
00:33:47,052 --> 00:33:48,690
- [both] Bollenbecker.
- [gasps]

552
00:33:48,852 --> 00:33:52,480
- It's a small world, isn't it?
- Yes!

553
00:33:52,651 --> 00:33:56,439
Teeny. Like a marble.
Or a gumball.

554
00:33:56,611 --> 00:33:59,205
I had to drag Karl
by the ear to come here.

555
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:01,566
- It is a girly book.
- Oh, no. It's not that.

556
00:34:01,731 --> 00:34:05,439
Karl can be very girly. Only that he
doesn't like to socialise with someone

557
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:10,320
- whose company he intends to liquidate.
- Liquidate?

558
00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:13,880
- Who, Richard?
- Yes, but we can fix that.

559
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:17,724
After this party, you and Richard
will join us for dinner.

560
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:23,043
If Karl sees the man I saw,
Abdington Books will be safe, I'm sure.

561
00:34:23,209 --> 00:34:27,281
That is unbelievably kind of you,

562
00:34:27,448 --> 00:34:30,645
but you see, Richard and I made plans
and so we're supposed to...

563
00:34:30,808 --> 00:34:32,958
Only one thing
you're supposed to do, Emma,

564
00:34:33,128 --> 00:34:37,838
and it's to bring your fiancé to dinner.
Let's find Richard. Karl is waiting.

565
00:34:42,447 --> 00:34:46,360
Oh! Oh, oh, my husband hates you,
but you saved our marriage. Do you mind?

566
00:34:46,527 --> 00:34:48,518
Not at all.
Um, who shall I make it out to?

567
00:34:48,687 --> 00:34:50,120
- To...
- Richard!

568
00:34:53,686 --> 00:34:57,042
Um... thank you.

569
00:34:58,206 --> 00:35:00,197
Oh, hey, hey.
I brought your papers.

570
00:35:00,366 --> 00:35:04,517
Richard! Sweetheart.
Please go with me on this, OK?

571
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:06,880
- Remember Greta Bollenbecker?
- Cake lady!

572
00:35:07,045 --> 00:35:11,243
- [laughs] It's a small world.
- So small. Constantly shrinking.

573
00:35:11,405 --> 00:35:14,044
- It must be the global warming.
- I want to introduce you

574
00:35:14,204 --> 00:35:16,593
- to my husband.
- Her husband, Karl,

575
00:35:16,764 --> 00:35:19,483
is Karl Bollenbecker,
who just acquired Richard's,

576
00:35:19,644 --> 00:35:23,193
your publishing house and he's thinking
of dumping you, Richard, and it.

577
00:35:23,364 --> 00:35:26,435
- Wait, I own a publishing house?
- Yes, and you're my fiancé,

578
00:35:26,603 --> 00:35:29,800
so please just focus, concentrate.
Got it?

579
00:35:29,963 --> 00:35:32,397
- This is him.
- [laughs]

580
00:35:32,563 --> 00:35:35,521
- You must be the cake dunker.
- You got me.

581
00:35:35,683 --> 00:35:39,800
- That's my Richard!
- Casual Fridays?

582
00:35:39,962 --> 00:35:42,112
I actually just came
from soccer practise.

583
00:35:42,282 --> 00:35:45,160
- You play football?
- Well, I'm no Lucas Podolski.

584
00:35:45,322 --> 00:35:48,473
Podolski! [laughs]
Well, nothing could beat Podolski!

585
00:35:48,642 --> 00:35:52,759
I own his team and he is a magnificent
pain in the ass, but a genius.

586
00:35:52,921 --> 00:35:55,196
- [laughs]
- You own the Bayern München club?

587
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:58,592
Why don't you use Klose on defence?
He's been under-utilised.

588
00:35:58,761 --> 00:36:01,797
- That's what I told that stupid coach.
- Klinsmann? Gotta go.

589
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:05,316
- We agree. [laughs]
- Excuse me. My name's... Ow! Jesus!

590
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,038
- What?
- Hand noogies!

591
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:11,716
We give each other hand noogies.
This is my brother, Carl.

592
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,871
Your name is Carl as well?
This is a small world!

593
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:19,396
Yes, teeny! Like a gimlet. Yes, my tiny,
teeny little brother, but not small.

594
00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:22,710
No. Big. Older, but not by much.

595
00:36:22,879 --> 00:36:26,473
- Carl, who I love so very, very much.
- How's it goin', bro?

596
00:36:26,638 --> 00:36:30,551
- Wine?
- I'm sorry, I'm suddenly very thirsty.

597
00:36:30,718 --> 00:36:33,949
- Carl? Carl?
- [whispers] Carl.

598
00:36:34,118 --> 00:36:36,871
This is Karl Bollenbecker
and I'm Greta, his wife,

599
00:36:37,038 --> 00:36:41,747
- and we're so charmed by your sister.
- And her outspoken fiancé

600
00:36:41,917 --> 00:36:45,114
<i>who seems to find fault with
every player in the Bundesliga.</i>

601
00:36:45,277 --> 00:36:49,190
- But not Podolski.
- [laughs] But never Podolski!

602
00:36:50,516 --> 00:36:52,984
So, you sound English,
but your sister...

603
00:36:53,156 --> 00:36:56,512
- Can I borrow Emma?
- Yes, but we both had... I'm sorry.

604
00:36:56,676 --> 00:36:59,873
- [screams]
- [both] A hand noogie! [laughing]

605
00:37:00,916 --> 00:37:03,065
Who is that man out there
pretending to be me?

606
00:37:03,235 --> 00:37:05,305
- I can explain.
- He's wearing sweatpants.

607
00:37:05,475 --> 00:37:08,308
- Sullivan! Honey, you're stress-eating.
- I'm not. Go on.

608
00:37:08,475 --> 00:37:11,751
I wasn't at my father's. I was with
Sullivan. Not "with him" with him,

609
00:37:11,915 --> 00:37:15,987
but in his apartment drunk. That sounds
worse. I assure you I was fully clothed.

610
00:37:16,154 --> 00:37:18,827
Beyond that, I'm not certain,
except he showed up today

611
00:37:18,994 --> 00:37:21,030
with papers when I had
to go to the tasting,

612
00:37:21,194 --> 00:37:23,424
which you refused to go
because you're busy...

613
00:37:23,594 --> 00:37:26,187
- Get back to the Bollenbeckers!
- Right. Fine.

614
00:37:26,353 --> 00:37:29,265
At the cake tasting,
there was this sweet lady.

615
00:37:29,433 --> 00:37:33,870
And she thought Sullivan was my fiancé
and I just couldn't disappoint her.

616
00:37:34,033 --> 00:37:37,661
But this lady wasn't sweet at all.
She was Mrs Bollenbecker,

617
00:37:37,832 --> 00:37:40,141
- which I didn't know.
- You certainly know now!

618
00:37:40,312 --> 00:37:43,384
I do. Had I known I wouldn't
have let the whole thing continue.

619
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:46,703
But it did continue until everyone
was quite taken with him,

620
00:37:46,872 --> 00:37:49,510
especially Mrs Bollenbecker
when he sang.

621
00:37:49,671 --> 00:37:51,980
- He's a singer?
- No, no, no. He's a fireman.

622
00:37:52,151 --> 00:37:57,271
- Darling, are you sure you want that?
- Yes. Yes, I am. What is he doing here?

623
00:37:57,431 --> 00:37:59,899
He came to bring me
the notarised papers.

624
00:38:00,071 --> 00:38:04,586
But then there was Mrs Bollenbecker.
I'm Emma Lloyd, so he's my fiancé.

625
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:09,187
- And I am tiny brother Carl.
- Oh, Richard, I'm terribly sorry.

626
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:12,501
But, uh, oh, look! Mini-cupcakes.

627
00:38:12,669 --> 00:38:15,388
Look, Emma. I only got
about half of what you're saying,

628
00:38:15,549 --> 00:38:18,427
but this seems to be something
that can be cleaned up easily.

629
00:38:18,589 --> 00:38:22,218
So before you harpoon what is left of my
reputation, I am gonna go in there...

630
00:38:22,389 --> 00:38:25,107
No, no, no, you can't!
They're going to exterminate you.

631
00:38:25,268 --> 00:38:27,907
- What?
- Not you, Abdington Books.

632
00:38:28,068 --> 00:38:31,504
Terminate! No, liquidate! That's it.
Yes, chop it up in little pieces,

633
00:38:31,668 --> 00:38:35,377
sell it all off! Everything must go!
That's why Karl wasn't coming.

634
00:38:35,548 --> 00:38:37,902
- But he did come!
- Because Mrs B made him come.

635
00:38:38,067 --> 00:38:40,535
She made him come so he could meet you.

636
00:38:40,707 --> 00:38:44,859
Oh, look. I think he's
really starting to like you.

637
00:38:45,027 --> 00:38:47,587
Oh, all right, I...
Let me think now.

638
00:38:47,747 --> 00:38:50,897
Man owns so many entities, I can buy
a year before our paths cross,

639
00:38:51,066 --> 00:38:53,819
so we just have to get through this.
A few more minutes?

640
00:38:53,986 --> 00:38:58,821
And a dinner. Tonight. It was Mrs B's
idea, so Karl could get to know you.

641
00:38:58,986 --> 00:39:00,259
- He's gone.
- Karl?

642
00:39:00,425 --> 00:39:02,541
- No, Sullivan. He's gone.
- But the dinner!

643
00:39:02,705 --> 00:39:06,618
- Get him there!
- Oh, uh...

644
00:39:09,985 --> 00:39:12,862
- Is Sullivan even in here?
- I don't see how he'd fit.

645
00:39:13,024 --> 00:39:15,094
Not now, Marcy.

646
00:39:17,624 --> 00:39:20,343
- Find the lioness within.
- Now, you've read my book?

<i>- [vibrating]

Here's the deal.

649
00:39:25,503 --> 00:39:30,702
My entire career, and my marriage to
Richard, probably, are at stake here.

650
00:39:32,343 --> 00:39:37,132
Frankly, I need you.
I really need you... tonight.

who would leave his fiancée un-attended

664
00:40:33,938 --> 00:40:38,010
for so long might not be
as charming as I imagined.

But, no matter.
Please, join us for dessert.

And where I come from,
family comes first.

670

So I'm just here
to invite you to a party.

684
00:42:53,486 --> 00:42:55,954
My husband snores all the time.
I just, tight slap.

- Tight slap.
- You look really cute.

686

- Why do they snore?
- Check your mehndi for hidden messages.

687
00:43:05,125 --> 00:43:07,958
It's part of the tradition.
When marriages were arranged,

688
00:43:08,125 --> 00:43:12,834
the groom would search his bride's body
on their wedding night to find initials.

Goodbye, Wilder.

728
00:47:31,582 --> 00:47:33,777
Bye, sweetheart.

729
00:47:33,942 --> 00:47:36,058
Daddy loves you, nonetheless.

730
00:47:43,222 --> 00:47:47,658
The golf tee white is stylish,
but, um, I just, it's been done.

731
00:47:47,821 --> 00:47:51,496
And it's not as common as the
picket fence white, which is safe,

732
00:47:51,661 --> 00:47:53,811
but it's a bit boring.

733
00:47:53,981 --> 00:47:57,416
The Navajo white is bolder,
but it's sort of in-your-face white.

734
00:47:57,580 --> 00:48:01,095
I don't know, um...
They all look the same to me.

735
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:04,570
- In what way?
- In that they're all white.

736
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:08,732
Yes, but different,
I mean, wildly different.

737
00:48:08,899 --> 00:48:11,367
Are you not going
to ask me about last night?

738
00:48:11,539 --> 00:48:13,769
Well, I assumed it went pretty well.

739
00:48:13,939 --> 00:48:17,568
Bollenbecker Group just renewed my
contract five years, thanks to you.

740
00:48:17,739 --> 00:48:21,367
Now, all we need to do is file those
papers and we'll put this behind us.

741
00:48:21,538 --> 00:48:23,688
Um, well...

742
00:48:27,138 --> 00:48:28,457
I don't have the papers.

743
00:48:30,618 --> 00:48:32,767
- What's going on, Em?
- I don't know.

744
00:48:32,937 --> 00:48:36,452
He had them at the book signing.
Between the dinner and the upanayanam,

745
00:48:36,617 --> 00:48:40,849
Indian bar mitzvah, don't ask,
I misplaced them.

746
00:48:41,017 --> 00:48:43,211
- I had them in my hands!
- Don't worry about it.

747
00:48:43,376 --> 00:48:46,413
- It's so unlike me.
- It's all right.

748
00:48:46,576 --> 00:48:49,010
I'm gonna take care of everything
from now on.

749
00:48:51,576 --> 00:48:54,613
A white lie is still a lie.
It may be a subtler shade of truth,

750
00:48:54,776 --> 00:48:57,335
but anyone's who's looking
can see it on the wall.

751
00:48:57,495 --> 00:48:59,645
<i>[woman] So I should tell him the truth.</i>

752
00:48:59,815 --> 00:49:03,808
I'm saying that a cream-coloured,
ivory-hued, matte-finished, half-truth

753
00:49:03,975 --> 00:49:07,649
will erode the foundation
of your relationship.

754
00:49:07,814 --> 00:49:11,966
<i>- You're getting married soon, right?
- Yep. That's right.</i>

755
00:49:12,134 --> 00:49:16,252
<i>Your fiancé must be a lucky man
to know he has you to keep him honest.</i>

756
00:49:16,414 --> 00:49:17,927
We're both very lucky.

757
00:49:18,094 --> 00:49:21,403
Brother Carl.
Didn't know you played.

758
00:49:21,573 --> 00:49:25,009
Let's drop the bullshit, shall we?
It's Richard.

759
00:49:25,173 --> 00:49:28,961
- Richard Braxton, as you well know.
- Patrick Sullivan, as you well know.

760
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:31,851
Hell, we're practically family.

761
00:49:32,012 --> 00:49:35,084
You behaved like a real gentleman
over a rather odd period.

762
00:49:35,252 --> 00:49:37,482
- [laughs]
- Emma tells me you did me a good turn

763
00:49:37,652 --> 00:49:40,564
- and I appreciate that.
- It was fun.

764
00:49:40,732 --> 00:49:43,564
I have to play the spoil-sport
and ask for those papers

765
00:49:43,731 --> 00:49:46,609
- so we can go separate ways.
- I'll bring them by the office.

766
00:49:46,771 --> 00:49:49,160
- No, that's not gonna happen.
- Why's that?

767
00:49:49,331 --> 00:49:51,606
She and I have a life
which doesn't include you,

768
00:49:51,771 --> 00:49:55,126
and I want to keep it that way.
So I'm asking you man-to-man

769
00:49:55,290 --> 00:49:59,727
- not to see her, call her, text her.
- I'm not much of a texter.

770
00:50:01,730 --> 00:50:05,689
Somebody in your circle seems
to have a gift for technology.

771
00:50:05,850 --> 00:50:09,683
- What do you mean?
- The more I look into this glitch,

772
00:50:09,849 --> 00:50:12,841
as Emma calls it,
the less accidental it seems.

773
00:50:13,009 --> 00:50:16,558
You might be technologically-challenged.
Anyone close to you

774
00:50:16,729 --> 00:50:22,485
- might be able to pull this off?
- Not off the top of my head, no.

775
00:50:25,568 --> 00:50:27,524
I intend to find out who did this.

776
00:50:30,967 --> 00:50:35,722
<i>[¶¶ Nouvelle Vague: Ever Fallen in Love
(With Someone You Shouldn't've)]</i>

777
00:50:55,285 --> 00:50:59,164
<i>- [female caller talking]
- Something wrong with him.</i>

778
00:51:03,165 --> 00:51:05,837
I know you've been there.
We've all been there.

779
00:51:06,004 --> 00:51:10,520
Sounds like a crush. You're a grown
woman, let's call it an infatuation.

780
00:51:10,684 --> 00:51:13,403
...far bigger problems
than what you have now.

781
00:51:13,564 --> 00:51:17,443
You're dreaming! Wake up, girl. Do you
share the vision of the future?

782
00:51:17,603 --> 00:51:19,958
Is he dependable?
You have to ask yourself.

783
00:51:20,123 --> 00:51:23,354
Smart, successful, beautiful women
cannot live on kisses alone.

784
00:51:23,523 --> 00:51:28,233
You may think the chemistry
has commonality with friendship.

785
00:51:28,403 --> 00:51:32,236
Take a look at the compatibility
quizzes in my book, chapter seven.

786
00:51:32,402 --> 00:51:34,757
<i>- You'll find it illuminating.
- Thank you.</i>

787
00:51:34,922 --> 00:51:38,676
Thank you, caller.
Hi, you're on the air.

788
00:51:38,842 --> 00:51:42,516
<i>[Patrick] I'm reading your book, too.
You call this a self-help book</i>

789
00:51:42,681 --> 00:51:45,559
<i>- or does that term offend?
- Uh, not in the least.</i>

790
00:51:45,721 --> 00:51:51,114
- Who does it help, exactly?
- Well, it... [laughs]

791
00:51:51,281 --> 00:51:56,070
See, the thing is, I, um... I haven't
gotten to the helpful part yet.

792
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:59,232
- Perhaps you're a slow reader.
- No, it doesn't tell you how

793
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:03,029
to find somebody to love, or how you
get somebody to love you back.

794
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:06,908
All it does is tell you what's wrong
with the person you're in love with.

795
00:52:07,079 --> 00:52:09,513
That to me, well,
that's not very helpful.

796
00:52:09,679 --> 00:52:13,672
Perhaps it is you who are wrong for
the person you think you are right for.

797
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:16,911
What is it you know about me
that would make you say that?

798
00:52:17,078 --> 00:52:18,955
- I don't know you.
- You bet you don't.

799
00:52:19,118 --> 00:52:21,427
I don't. Since you called,
here's some advice.

800
00:52:21,598 --> 00:52:23,953
Instead of blaming others
for your problems,

801
00:52:24,118 --> 00:52:27,349
- consider looking at yourself.
- I'm looking right at my problem.

802
00:52:27,518 --> 00:52:33,467
- Well, stop fogging up the mirror.
- [laughs] Nice.

803
00:52:33,637 --> 00:52:37,596
- Did you just hang up on a caller?
- I did not just hang up on a caller.

804
00:52:37,757 --> 00:52:42,910
<i>Hello? Hello? Uh, hello?
I think we've been disconnected.</i>

805
00:52:43,076 --> 00:52:46,068
It must be those cell phones,
those nasty cell phones.

806
00:52:46,236 --> 00:52:50,673
Thanks to my caller for calling
and I will be seeing you tomorrow

00:52:58,235 --> 00:53:01,784
Are you crazy? How dare you come to my
place of work and make prank calls?

810
00:53:01,955 --> 00:53:04,469
I'm flipping through this
and it was so full of crap

811
00:53:04,634 --> 00:53:08,263
- that maybe I ought to call in!
- I see you actually bought my book.

812
00:53:08,434 --> 00:53:11,551
- No. I stole it from your party.
- Stole it. That makes sense.

813
00:53:11,714 --> 00:53:13,625
And I took your compatibility quiz.

814
00:53:13,794 --> 00:53:15,989
- Really? How did you do?
- According to this,

815
00:53:16,154 --> 00:53:20,032
my lifestyle is wholly unsuitable to
any freak who would buy or write a book

816
00:53:20,193 --> 00:53:23,947
- like this.
- Surprise. Those tests don't lie.

817
00:53:24,113 --> 00:53:26,627
New York City Fire Department.
Official business.

818
00:53:26,793 --> 00:53:30,307
Please exit the elevator.
Come on, ladies. Sir, thank you.

819
00:53:30,472 --> 00:53:33,066
- What are you doing?
- Unsuitable?

820
00:53:33,232 --> 00:53:38,101
Is that really what you think of me?

821
00:53:38,272 --> 00:53:41,468
I don't think of you.

822
00:53:41,631 --> 00:53:43,940
You want to see unsuitable?

823
00:54:00,910 --> 00:54:02,946
- [alarm buzzing]
- Hey, security,

824
00:54:03,110 --> 00:54:05,339
- what's the story with the elevator?
- Holy!

825
00:54:05,509 --> 00:54:10,025
- My wife loves her show.
- Delivery.

826
00:54:10,189 --> 00:54:12,464
I can't even get a guy
to hold a door for me.

827
00:54:12,629 --> 00:54:15,938
- Step back, please.
- Can you fix the focus on that?

828
00:54:16,108 --> 00:54:18,338
- Zoom in a little bit.
- There you go.

829
00:54:20,388 --> 00:54:25,826
I've had enough of this. Excuse me, sir?
Doctor? Doctor?

830
00:54:25,988 --> 00:54:29,616
I'm gonna have to ask you
to please stop. Stop what you're doing.

831
00:54:29,787 --> 00:54:33,223
Come down to the lobby immediately.
Stop it.

832
00:54:33,387 --> 00:54:35,298
<i>Stop it now, please.</i>

833
00:54:51,985 --> 00:54:54,294
[laughing]

834
00:55:02,145 --> 00:55:04,533
- Sorry about that.
- Which part, exactly?

835
00:55:04,704 --> 00:55:06,854
- Kissing you thing.
- We just got caught up.

836
00:55:07,024 --> 00:55:09,618
- Carried away.
- Lost our heads.

837
00:55:11,184 --> 00:55:13,061
I'm getting married.

838
00:55:15,383 --> 00:55:18,853
Yeah.

839
00:55:19,023 --> 00:55:20,695
You love him?

840
00:55:20,863 --> 00:55:23,855
I only ask this because...

841
00:55:24,023 --> 00:55:27,697
being that I'm your husband and
you're my wife, I have this...

842
00:55:27,862 --> 00:55:30,979
I have this vested interest
in seeing you happy.

843
00:55:31,142 --> 00:55:35,055
I want to be happy. Don't you?

844
00:55:35,222 --> 00:55:37,577
What is happiness anyway?

845
00:55:39,461 --> 00:55:40,894
I don't know.

846
00:55:41,061 --> 00:55:43,052
You tell me, you wrote the book.

847
00:55:43,221 --> 00:55:45,337
I guess I don't know.

848
00:55:57,620 --> 00:56:01,499
- Patrick...
- It was nice being married to you.

849
00:56:02,540 --> 00:56:04,131
You, too.

850
00:56:06,579 --> 00:56:09,810
- Thanks.
- Goodbye, Emma.

851
00:56:16,338 --> 00:56:19,933
Oh! Oh, oh!

852
00:57:05,534 --> 00:57:09,004
I'm sorry I'm late.
I know, I'm always so prompt.

853
00:57:09,174 --> 00:57:13,725
Don't worry. When I arrived, I told them
to bring the drinks in ten minutes.

854
00:57:13,894 --> 00:57:16,885
- How's that for timing?
- Oh, what a day. You have no idea.

855
00:57:17,053 --> 00:57:19,851
Actually, I kind of do.

856
00:57:20,013 --> 00:57:21,810
I heard your show today.

857
00:57:21,973 --> 00:57:24,043
- That was Sullivan, I take it?
- Yes.

858
00:57:24,213 --> 00:57:26,965
The good news is I got the papers.

859
00:57:27,132 --> 00:57:31,284
Everything but page 127,
and I'm sure it's in there somewhere.

860
00:57:31,452 --> 00:57:35,161
- We'll never see him again.
- So why don't you look happy?

861
00:57:35,332 --> 00:57:36,924
I am.

862
00:57:38,931 --> 00:57:41,525
Well, I've got something
that might cheer you up.

863
00:57:41,691 --> 00:57:46,128
Harry Winston finished our rings.
Now, wanna have a look?

864
00:57:47,731 --> 00:57:49,642
Wow!

865
00:57:49,811 --> 00:57:53,598
See, the circle of eternity
came out great, don't you think?

866
00:57:53,770 --> 00:57:58,286
- No. They did mine wrong.
- What are you talking about?

867
00:57:58,450 --> 00:58:00,805
- It's perfect.
- It says "Do I? Do I? Do I?"

868
00:58:00,970 --> 00:58:02,368
Not "I do, I do, I do. "

869
00:58:13,009 --> 00:58:16,284
Em, you're under a tremendous
amount of stress at the moment.

870
00:58:16,448 --> 00:58:19,008
It's not stress, Richard.
I just don't know.

871
00:58:19,168 --> 00:58:21,636
I'm really confused.

872
00:58:21,808 --> 00:58:24,845
Well, I'm not confused, Em.
I know exactly what I want.

873
00:58:25,008 --> 00:58:30,286
I think you and I are the perfect team.
Never doubted it for a moment.

874
00:58:30,447 --> 00:58:33,837
But I am not gonna
talk you into marrying me.

875
00:58:34,007 --> 00:58:36,475
Take a few days
and figure out what it is you want.

876
00:58:36,647 --> 00:58:39,365
In fact, why don't we
begin that right now.

877
00:58:39,526 --> 00:58:41,437
Richard.

878
00:58:43,206 --> 00:58:47,199
<i>[female caller] We had a really
nice time. Good conversation.</i>

879
00:58:47,366 --> 00:58:50,437
<i>He was sweet and funny,
but I don't know. Something's missing.</i>

880
00:58:50,605 --> 00:58:53,438
<i>- There was no... Exactly.
- Spark?</i>

881
00:58:53,605 --> 00:58:55,994
Yeah, let me
tell you something about sparks.

882
00:58:56,165 --> 00:58:59,760
Sparks cause fires and fires
will burn your house down.

883
00:58:59,925 --> 00:59:03,280
Keep searching for good ol' Sparky,
you're sure to get burned.

884
00:59:03,444 --> 00:59:05,958
Trust me on that, OK?

885
00:59:16,323 --> 00:59:20,111
[Lauren laughing]
Oh, I'm so hungry!

886
00:59:20,283 --> 00:59:23,673
Wilder!
Your girlfriend's wearing my robe!

887
00:59:23,843 --> 00:59:28,279
Actually, his girlfriend's daughter
is wearing your robe.

888
00:59:28,442 --> 00:59:31,320
- Hello, Emma.
- Aren't you my?

889
00:59:33,002 --> 00:59:36,517
- [whistling]
- So, um, why the big secret?

890
00:59:36,682 --> 00:59:39,753
I wanted to tell you.
Your father thought you wouldn't hire me

891
00:59:39,921 --> 00:59:41,718
as caterer
if you knew we were dating.

892
00:59:41,881 --> 00:59:45,510
- Is that what you call it?
- That or this is an elaborate ruse

893
00:59:45,681 --> 00:59:49,389
- of yours to get out of paying my bill.
- You have been worth every penny.

894
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:53,951
There you go again,
always saying the perfect thing.

895
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:57,635
You've been together for almost a year.
Why didn't you tell me?

896
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:00,836
You've met so many women over the years,
I thought I'd hold off

897
01:00:00,999 --> 01:00:03,593
on this introduction
until we were sure of each other.

898
01:00:03,759 --> 01:00:06,432
- And are we?
- Well, I am.

899
01:00:06,599 --> 01:00:11,150
I can't even keep track of all
the things I've misunderstood.

900
01:00:11,319 --> 01:00:12,638
[whispers] Sorry.

901
01:00:15,878 --> 01:00:18,870
Dad? I know I never asked you,

902
01:00:19,038 --> 01:00:23,111
but, um, what do you think of Richard?
Do you like him?

903
01:00:23,278 --> 01:00:28,431
Well, sure, honey. What's not to like?
I mean, he's perfect, isn't he?

904
01:00:28,597 --> 01:00:32,146
- Is that a compliment?
- You don't need compliments from me.

905
01:00:32,317 --> 01:00:34,831
I've never told you
how to live or who to date.

906
01:00:34,997 --> 01:00:37,988
That's always been in your department.

907
01:00:38,156 --> 01:00:41,228
So, what if I'm, uh,
losing my footing in my department

908
01:00:41,396 --> 01:00:44,866
and I'm asking for a second opinion?

909
01:00:45,036 --> 01:00:48,914
Well, I think Richard is a...

910
01:00:49,075 --> 01:00:50,906
...a good, safe bet. You know?

911
01:00:51,075 --> 01:00:53,953
He's the kind of guy
that you've always gravitated toward

912
01:00:54,115 --> 01:00:58,188
and advised other women to pursue,
isn't he?

913
01:00:58,355 --> 01:01:02,472
Probably the type of fellow that my
brand of fatherhood pushed you into.

914
01:01:02,634 --> 01:01:04,829
- [laughs]
- Look, honey, I mean,

915
01:01:04,994 --> 01:01:08,782
I've made some big mistakes in my life,
some real whoppers,

916
01:01:08,954 --> 01:01:12,707
but if I hadn't I probably wouldn't have
been able to recognise the real thing

917
01:01:12,873 --> 01:01:18,391
when it came along. You don't
have to be so right all the time.

918
01:01:18,553 --> 01:01:20,191
It's OK to make a couple mistakes.

919
01:01:30,192 --> 01:01:32,626
- Hello, tall lady!
- Oh, Emma!

920
01:01:32,792 --> 01:01:35,465
Emma, you're drenched.
Come, darling.

921
01:01:35,632 --> 01:01:38,020
- Move, she has to eat something.
- Quiet!

922
01:01:38,191 --> 01:01:42,628
Can't you see that she's not here
to eat or watch telly or chit-chat?

923
01:01:42,791 --> 01:01:45,066
She's come for the man she loves.

924
01:01:45,231 --> 01:01:48,825
Here you are with your "come, come"
and your "sit, sit" and your "eat, eat".

925
01:01:48,990 --> 01:01:52,107
You're standing in the course
of true love. Stand aside, I say!

926
01:01:52,270 --> 01:01:54,659
Through the beads,
up the stairs, two flights.

927
01:01:59,390 --> 01:02:01,300
What?

928
01:02:06,269 --> 01:02:08,578
Yeah, it's raining.

929
01:02:08,749 --> 01:02:10,819
Figured you'd have the day off.

930
01:02:12,268 --> 01:02:13,701
Come in.

931
01:02:18,988 --> 01:02:20,660
Oh, here you go.

932
01:02:20,828 --> 01:02:23,864
Let me, uh,
let me get you some dry clothes.

933
01:02:25,147 --> 01:02:27,615
- Patrick?
- Yeah.

934
01:02:29,627 --> 01:02:31,857
I think I called off my wedding.

935
01:02:37,426 --> 01:02:41,214
Emma, I...
I need to tell you something.

936
01:02:47,465 --> 01:02:51,777
- What?
- It can wait.

937
01:02:57,585 --> 01:02:59,461
[moaning]

938
01:03:42,901 --> 01:03:44,334
Oh.

939
01:03:46,701 --> 01:03:49,851
- How's it going in there, babe?
- Great!

940
01:03:50,020 --> 01:03:53,410
- We're having toast!
- I'll be out in a minute.

941
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:56,048
- OK.

What is this? And this? And this?
Are you some sick stalker?

947
01:04:36,816 --> 01:04:38,932
No, Emma, it's not what you think.
Emma!

948
01:04:39,096 --> 01:04:41,326
- Emma! Emma, wait!
- I can't believe this.

949
01:04:41,496 --> 01:04:43,373
I saw the invitation. You're married?

950
01:04:43,536 --> 01:04:47,653
- No! No, I'm not married!
- Liar. Stay away from me!

951
01:04:47,815 --> 01:04:49,612
Emma! Emma, I can explain.

952
01:04:49,775 --> 01:04:54,166
Yeah? What, that this is no accident?
There was no glitch?

953
01:04:54,335 --> 01:04:57,930
No, you. You are the glitch.
You Googled me, invaded my life,

954
01:04:58,095 --> 01:05:01,769
invaded my privacy,
ruined my relationship.

955
01:05:01,934 --> 01:05:04,732
I almost called off my wedding for you!

956
01:05:04,894 --> 01:05:07,613
I trusted you! I had sex with you.

957
01:05:07,774 --> 01:05:11,482
You're just some sort of con man,
scam artist, deranged fan?

958
01:05:11,653 --> 01:05:14,725
- Know what? Don't flatter yourself.
- I... What have I done?

959
01:05:14,893 --> 01:05:18,886
Richard warned me about you. I warn
people about men like you every day!

960
01:05:19,053 --> 01:05:21,283
- I'm worse than my own callers.
- Emma! Stop!

961
01:05:21,453 --> 01:05:23,249
Thank you.

962
01:05:23,412 --> 01:05:26,802
Can I show you something? Please?

963
01:05:29,972 --> 01:05:31,325
Do you know her?

964
01:05:33,452 --> 01:05:36,966
- No, I don't.
- Yeah, you don't. Come here.

965
01:05:38,691 --> 01:05:41,808
That's Sofia, as in "You're cordially
invited to the marriage

966
01:05:41,971 --> 01:05:45,883
of Patrick Thomas Sullivan
and Sofia Idelia Maria Chechagua. "

967
01:05:46,050 --> 01:05:49,122
She's Dominican. We met on the job.
She almost blew up a building

968
01:05:49,290 --> 01:05:52,885
polishing those nails of hers.
I carried her down 15 flights of stairs

969
01:05:53,050 --> 01:05:55,518
and sat next to her hospital bed
until she woke up.

970
01:05:55,690 --> 01:05:59,045
- What does this have to do with me?
- She was a big fan of your show.

971
01:05:59,209 --> 01:06:02,167
Listened to it every day.
One day, she called in.

972
01:06:02,329 --> 01:06:05,082
- You probably don't remember.
- No, I don't.

973
01:06:05,249 --> 01:06:08,241
- You told her to call off the wedding.
- Patrick...

974
01:06:08,409 --> 01:06:11,445
Someone you don't know and can't
remember, you changed her life

975
01:06:11,608 --> 01:06:14,566
and mine forever.

976
01:06:14,728 --> 01:06:17,037
I guess I wanted
to educate you about that.

977
01:06:17,208 --> 01:06:20,757
About what it's like to have your
life ripped out from under you.

978
01:06:20,928 --> 01:06:22,679
I wanted to knock you down a peg.

979
01:06:25,807 --> 01:06:28,321
- You did.
- Emma, I...

980
01:06:28,487 --> 01:06:31,001
- Goodbye, Patrick.
- Emma.

981
01:06:31,167 --> 01:06:32,885
Emma.

982
01:06:58,284 --> 01:07:00,434
It's beautiful.

983
01:07:00,604 --> 01:07:04,563
I was just thinking how... how it's
too big for me without you here.

984
01:07:07,884 --> 01:07:10,078
Are you here?

985
01:07:12,723 --> 01:07:14,281
If you'll have me.

986
01:07:15,563 --> 01:07:18,680
Do you mean you still
want to get married?

987
01:07:18,843 --> 01:07:20,720
[laughs] I do.

988
01:07:21,562 --> 01:07:23,439
I do. I do.

989

<i>[¶¶ Feist: I Feel It All]</i>

990
01:07:25,762 --> 01:07:28,640
[Emma] As many of you have heard,
I'm getting married.

991
01:07:28,802 --> 01:07:32,397
People keep asking me if I'm nervous.
Well, I'm not.

992
01:07:32,562 --> 01:07:35,917
My eyes are open and what I see
is not the man of my dreams,

993
01:07:36,081 --> 01:07:38,037
but the man of my reality.

994
01:07:38,201 --> 01:07:41,079
He's who he says he is,
there where he's supposed to be.

995
01:07:41,241 --> 01:07:43,835
If you want to close your eyes
and jump in,

996
01:07:44,001 --> 01:07:46,309
try the high-diving board at the YMCA.

997
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:52,317
There's a generation of men
and women roaming New York City

998
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:55,711
in search of the
holy grail dream partner.

999
01:07:55,880 --> 01:08:00,589
But until we learn the difference
between romantic love and real love,

1000
01:08:00,759 --> 01:08:05,389
we're just searching in vain for
something that doesn't even exist.

1001

Here we are. Until next time.

1002
01:08:42,996 --> 01:08:44,826
Ask yourself serious questions.

1003
01:08:44,995 --> 01:08:48,226
Couples shouldn't have to hide.
Play with fire, get burned.

1004
01:08:48,395 --> 01:08:51,307
Irresponsible. Dependable?
You can't trust what you lust.

1005
01:08:51,475 --> 01:08:55,229
Does he give you a stable universe?
Love has to be earned, not yearned.

1006
01:08:55,395 --> 01:08:59,945
Stop obsessing about this old girlfriend
of his. Got it? All right. Next caller.

1007
01:09:00,114 --> 01:09:02,503
It's a hard decision.
Am I right? Well, caller...

1008
01:09:02,674 --> 01:09:05,472
Trust me on that. Next caller.
Based on what? What?

1009
01:09:05,634 --> 01:09:07,306
Trust me on that, OK?
OK, well...

1010
01:09:07,474 --> 01:09:10,192

01:09:57,749 --> 01:09:59,785
Patrick of Astoria.

1022
01:10:04,789 --> 01:10:07,223
- Patrick of Astoria.
- Oh, really?

1023
01:10:07,388 --> 01:10:10,027
I thought for a second
you weren't gonna put me through.

1024
01:10:10,188 --> 01:10:14,147
Thousands of people are listening. Let's
not waste their time. How can I help?

1025
01:10:14,308 --> 01:10:18,938
There's... there's this girl that I'm...
that I'm falling for.

1026
01:10:19,108 --> 01:10:21,826
That I have fallen for.

1027
01:10:21,987 --> 01:10:26,060
<i>And, uh, well the trick is she's...
she's getting married tomorrow.</i>

1028
01:10:26,227 --> 01:10:29,060
<i>And if that's what she really wants,
then I'm happy for her.</i>

1029
01:10:29,227 --> 01:10:32,024
That's very generous of you,
Patrick from Astoria.

1030
01:10:32,186 --> 01:10:34,700
There's one other thing that...

1031
01:10:34,866 --> 01:10:37,505
<i>...that she doesn't know.
- We're almost out of time.</i>

1032
01:10:37,666 --> 01:10:41,261
The thing that
I didn't tell her is, um...

1033
01:10:41,426 --> 01:10:43,700
<i>- The thing she doesn't know...
- Come on.</i>

1034
01:10:43,865 --> 01:10:46,015
...is that I love her.

1035
01:10:46,185 --> 01:10:50,258
<i>You know, I, uh, I look at her
and I see, I see my whole life.</i>

1036
01:10:50,425 --> 01:10:54,418
<i>And I just thought
she should know that.</i>

1037
01:10:54,585 --> 01:10:57,052
I'm afraid that's
all the time we have, caller.

1038
01:10:57,224 --> 01:11:00,580
<i>- [all groaning]
- This is Dr Emma Lloyd.</i>

1039
01:11:00,744 --> 01:11:02,655
<i>And you're listening to Real Love.</i>

1040
01:11:02,824 --> 01:11:04,701
Where's she going?

1041
01:11:04,864 --> 01:11:06,820
- Get in there.
- OK.

1042
01:11:06,983 --> 01:11:09,178
<i>[Marcy] Let's see, we got, um, Chuck</i>

1043
01:11:09,343 --> 01:11:12,062
on line four is looking
for his soul mate,

1044
01:11:12,223 --> 01:11:16,899
and Maria on line two
just got dumped. So, Chuck?

1045
01:11:17,063 --> 01:11:19,132
<i>- [man] Yeah?
- Say what's up to Maria.</i>

1046
01:11:19,302 --> 01:11:20,291
<i>How you doin'?</i>

1047
01:11:30,781 --> 01:11:34,217
Well? Do you really like it?

1048
01:11:34,381 --> 01:11:37,771
- Perfect. You're perfect.
- I'm fucked.

1049
01:11:37,941 --> 01:11:40,819
It's an interesting segue. [laughs]

1050
01:11:40,981 --> 01:11:44,290
- Did you listen to the show last night?
- Yes.

1051
01:11:44,460 --> 01:11:46,291
- He loves me.
- I know.

1052
01:11:46,460 --> 01:11:49,657
The entire tri-state area knows.
The car's here.

1053
01:11:49,820 --> 01:11:53,779
- What am I gonna do?
- Well, first thing we should fire her.

1054
01:11:53,940 --> 01:11:56,897
- I heard that.
- Sister at the keyhole,

1055
01:11:57,059 --> 01:11:59,971
- just what you always wanted, huh?
- I did, didn't I?

1056
01:12:00,139 --> 01:12:02,494
Instead you got you and me.

1057
01:12:02,659 --> 01:12:06,015
We didn't do too badly, did we?
We were a disaster.

1058
01:12:06,179 --> 01:12:07,691
Yeah, we were.

1059
01:12:11,338 --> 01:12:14,250
But I see a comeback in the making.

1060
01:12:14,418 --> 01:12:16,693
Yeah?

1061
01:12:16,858 --> 01:12:20,850
[bell tolls]

1062
01:12:21,017 --> 01:12:24,054
[Wilder] For a guy who's waited
this long to marry my daughter,

1063
01:12:24,217 --> 01:12:27,175
he sure is cutting it close,
don't you think?

1064
01:12:27,337 --> 01:12:30,010
- Do you know how I know I love you?
- How?

1065
01:12:30,176 --> 01:12:33,930
Because nothing in the world would
make me drag you to the altar again.

1066
01:12:34,096 --> 01:12:36,485
We don't want
to press our luck, do we?

1067
01:12:37,456 --> 01:12:40,368
I should go see how Emma's doing.
Let me know if he gets here.

1068
01:12:50,215 --> 01:12:53,252
- Take it off, Marcy. It's crooked.
- Let me try.

1069
01:12:53,415 --> 01:12:57,009
Oh, so this goes like this.

1070
01:12:59,734 --> 01:13:02,885
And this... goes here.

1071
01:13:03,934 --> 01:13:05,889
Here comes the bride.

1072
01:13:11,573 --> 01:13:13,962
- I can't do this.
- [knocking]

1073
01:13:17,852 --> 01:13:20,127
Excuse me, ladies.
Could I have a moment?

1074
01:13:35,571 --> 01:13:37,607
- Richard...
- Wow.

1075
01:13:37,771 --> 01:13:39,204
Look at you.

1076
01:13:39,371 --> 01:13:44,763
Seems kind of silly, though, huh?
Me in this dress, veil.

1077
01:13:44,930 --> 01:13:48,286
Bridesmaids. It's like
some sort of play or something.

1078
01:13:48,450 --> 01:13:51,601
No, you don't look silly.

1079
01:13:53,729 --> 01:13:58,086
Well, you look extremely not silly
and handsome yourself.

1080
01:14:01,689 --> 01:14:05,476
I'm sorry I'm late. I had to go back
to the city and get something for you.

1081
01:14:13,728 --> 01:14:15,400
You forgot to file them.

1082
01:14:17,927 --> 01:14:20,760
You should know by now,
I'm not really the forgetful type.

1083
01:14:20,927 --> 01:14:23,600
No, no you're not.

1084
01:14:24,767 --> 01:14:30,159
Ever since you gave me these, I've been
putting off filing them for some reason.

1085
01:14:30,326 --> 01:14:33,204
Why do you think that is?

1086
01:14:35,526 --> 01:14:37,756
I love you, Em.

1087
01:14:37,926 --> 01:14:40,156
I'm clever enough
to know when I've lost.

1088
01:14:44,285 --> 01:14:48,278
I should have asked you
to marry me a long time ago.

1089
01:14:48,445 --> 01:14:50,913
Well, maybe we just missed our moment.

1090
01:14:52,765 --> 01:14:57,076
If you marry me today, you'll
always be looking over your shoulder.

1091
01:14:57,244 --> 01:14:59,314
You'll never be completely happy.

1092
01:15:02,564 --> 01:15:05,999
- You need to be happy, Em.
- I can't stand it.

1093
01:15:06,163 --> 01:15:08,597
Oh, Richard.

1094
01:15:09,363 --> 01:15:11,399
It'll be all right.

1095
01:15:12,523 --> 01:15:17,471
I'll be all right. As soon as we
can get past that angry mob out there.

1096
01:15:17,642 --> 01:15:19,997
Oh, yeah, them.

1097
01:15:20,162 --> 01:15:22,039
I'll handle this.

1098
01:15:22,202 --> 01:15:23,396
Really?

1099
01:15:25,242 --> 01:15:29,075
No, not really. In fact, this time you
should worry. I have no plan.

1100
01:15:38,401 --> 01:15:42,678
Come on, help me up.
Give me that candle.

1101
01:15:46,360 --> 01:15:51,229
Would you just wait until I've left
the room. I might need this suit again.

1102
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:53,037
Richard?

1103
01:16:04,438 --> 01:16:07,032
[screaming]

1104
01:16:08,798 --> 01:16:11,631
[siren wailing]

1105
01:16:18,197 --> 01:16:20,836
<i>[man] Engine 41,
this is Great Neck dispatch.</i>

1106
01:16:20,997 --> 01:16:24,467
<i>We've got a fire alarm and sprinkler
activation at Saint Paul's church.</i>

1107
01:16:24,637 --> 01:16:27,310
Great Neck?
It's not even in our district.

1108
01:16:27,477 --> 01:16:31,469
Listen, I know it's out of your
district, but here's the thing.

1109
01:16:31,636 --> 01:16:34,628
You guys have sort of been requested.

1110
01:17:13,953 --> 01:17:18,503
- How you doin'?
- I had to talk to you!

1111
01:17:23,792 --> 01:17:25,987
You could have just called.

1112
01:17:29,871 --> 01:17:32,101
So, what's up?

1113
01:17:34,991 --> 01:17:37,300
This.

1114
01:17:48,430 --> 01:17:50,546
- [cheering]
- [Emma] When I was a kid,

1115
01:17:50,710 --> 01:17:54,019
I used to have a hard time
believing in happy endings.

1116
01:17:54,189 --> 01:17:58,819
The heroine rode off into the sunset
with what I thought was the wrong guy.

1117
01:17:58,989 --> 01:18:02,220
<i>One day, my dad found me crying.
I was watching Lady and the Tramp</i>

1118
01:18:02,389 --> 01:18:06,506
and he asked me what was wrong.
I said, "Dad, those two dogs

1119
01:18:06,668 --> 01:18:11,219
don't stand a chance. They're wrong for
each other. They have nothing in common.

1120
01:18:11,388 --> 01:18:15,300
The movie's gonna end, they're gonna
break up and be heartbroken forever. "

1121
01:18:15,467 --> 01:18:18,300
He pulled me in close and he said to me,

1122
01:18:18,467 --> 01:18:23,541
"Em, sometimes when you're really in
love you don't sweat the small stuff. "

1123
01:18:23,707 --> 01:18:26,346
<i>[woman] Are you saying
we should run away together?</i>

1124
01:18:26,507 --> 01:18:28,974
Are you insane?
You're old enough to be his mother.

1125
01:18:29,146 --> 01:18:31,341
<i>- Wait till he gets out of school.
- Who is this?</i>

1126
01:18:31,506 --> 01:18:33,974
- Good day to you, madam.
- You were going to behave.

1127
01:18:34,146 --> 01:18:38,424
I don't know how you do this. People
drive me crazy. It won't happen again.

1128
01:18:38,586 --> 01:18:42,419
- Where was I?
- Don't sweat the small stuff.

1129
01:18:42,585 --> 01:18:45,657
I didn't appreciate
my father's advice for a long time.

1130
01:18:45,825 --> 01:18:49,261
You have to figure out those things
for yourself. But enough about me.

1131
01:18:49,425 --> 01:18:52,814
It's a quarter past the hour and now
for a word from our sponsors.

1132
01:18:52,984 --> 01:18:57,421
<i>This is Dr Emma Lloyd, you're listening
to Real Love. Please, don't go away.</i>

[knocking on glass]

1134
01:19:01,424 --> 01:19:04,495
Haven't you got any
cats to pull out of trees?

1135
01:19:04,663 --> 01:19:08,542
That only happens in cartoons,
Mrs Sullivan, as you well know.

1136
01:19:08,703 --> 01:19:11,171
Indeed I do, Mr Sullivan.
What can I do for ya?

1137
01:19:11,343 --> 01:19:15,574
Happened to be in the neighbourhood,
thought I'd stop by and say hello.

1138
01:19:15,742 --> 01:19:19,701
- Why don't ya come here for a second?
- [laughs] I can't leave my desk.

1139
01:19:19,862 --> 01:19:23,218
- I have to be back on any second.
- Oh, come on. They can wait.

1140
01:19:23,382 --> 01:19:26,294
Just stand up and walk towards me.

1141
01:19:26,461 --> 01:19:30,090
- You didn't come to see me at all.
- Of course, I did.

OK.
