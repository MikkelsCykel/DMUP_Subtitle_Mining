00:00:09,636 --> 00:00:11,271
As many of you know,

2
00:00:11,271 --> 00:00:13,573
the past few months of my life
have been very difficult.

3
00:00:13,606 --> 00:00:16,209
I don't know how I would have gotten
through it without all of you.

4
00:00:16,242 --> 00:00:19,612
I really think it's a testament
of the love in this institution

5
00:00:19,646 --> 00:00:20,980
that I stand before you today

6
00:00:21,014 --> 00:00:22,949
as the first straight-C student
in school history

7
00:00:22,982 --> 00:00:24,551
to be voted
valedictorian.

8
00:00:24,584 --> 00:00:27,353
While I may not have
excelled in the classroom,

9
00:00:27,387 --> 00:00:29,589
I think that
my recent experiences

10
00:00:29,622 --> 00:00:31,357
in that bigger schoolhouse
we call life

11
00:00:31,391 --> 00:00:35,095
has taught me a few lessons I'd like
to share with my fellow graduates:

12
00:00:35,128 --> 00:00:36,896
Follow your heart
and don't question it,

13
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:38,998
no matter where
it tells you to go.

14
00:00:39,032 --> 00:00:42,836
Trust me, it'll open up a world of new
experiences you can't even imagine.

15
00:00:42,869 --> 00:00:45,872
I bet you're wondering what
a straight-C student is doing

16
00:00:45,905 --> 00:00:47,974
giving
a valedictorian speech.

17
00:00:48,007 --> 00:00:49,776
It wasn't easy,
believe me.

18
00:00:49,809 --> 00:00:52,112
But with desire, focus

19
00:00:52,112 --> 00:00:54,781
and the willingness to treat
any obstacle as an opportunity,

20
00:00:54,814 --> 00:00:56,549
it's amazing what
you can accomplish.

21
00:01:01,488 --> 00:01:03,957
See, I was blessed
with a terrific mom...

22
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:07,427
not only is she a lush,
but she also hates me.

23
00:01:08,561 --> 00:01:10,130
A couple of days
before my birthday,

24
00:01:10,163 --> 00:01:12,766
I overhear her ordering me
a male stripper.

25
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,000
Nothing says
"I love you"

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,069
like 10" of man meat
popping out of a cake.

27
00:01:16,102 --> 00:01:18,004
And knowing
dear old Mom,

28
00:01:18,038 --> 00:01:19,706
she'll try and nail him
after the party,

29
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:22,308
but not before she tends
to more important business

30
00:01:22,342 --> 00:01:25,412
with her new best friend
Jelena Mariskova Flachsman,

31
00:01:25,445 --> 00:01:28,715
the imported trophy wife
of our family lawyer Irv Flachsman.

32
00:01:29,716 --> 00:01:32,752
Peggy told me
you found a new masseur.

33
00:01:32,752 --> 00:01:35,889
- I hear he's...
- You heard right.

34
00:01:38,091 --> 00:01:40,427
So can I have
his number?

35
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:43,329
Ahem...
we'll see.

36
00:01:53,606 --> 00:01:55,508
That guy next
to Flachsman...

37
00:01:55,542 --> 00:01:57,444
our neighbor
Mike Rudell...

38
00:01:57,477 --> 00:01:59,512
big-shot TV producer
and the guy my mom screws

39
00:01:59,546 --> 00:02:01,047
whenever the batteries
run out.

40
00:02:01,081 --> 00:02:03,616
I'm totally addicted
to his new show.

41
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:06,419
Welcome to
"Absolutely Positive,"

42
00:02:06,453 --> 00:02:09,222
the show where we give couples
who are about to get married

43
00:02:09,255 --> 00:02:11,725
one last chance
to make sure they're...

44
00:02:11,758 --> 00:02:14,561
- Absolutely positive!
- That's right!

45
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:28,675
See, I just don't
understand people

46
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:30,877
who live their lives
as one big routine.

47
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,345
They're basically saying,

48
00:02:32,379 --> 00:02:34,881
"I'm not worthy of a unique
experience on this earth."

49
00:02:34,914 --> 00:02:36,950
Well, sorry,
but I am.

50
00:02:36,983 --> 00:02:39,419
What the hell is going on?
I told you to wait!

51
00:02:39,452 --> 00:02:42,021
For God's sake,
she's not even here, you moron!

52
00:02:48,528 --> 00:02:49,829
Shake it, baby!

53
00:03:03,443 --> 00:03:05,912
My mother moved out
to LA from Ohio

54
00:03:05,945 --> 00:03:08,214
when she was 20
to become an actress.

55
00:03:08,248 --> 00:03:10,817
After a few years, she got knocked up
by a sleezeball producer

56
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:13,653
who told her she couldn't be on his show
unless she hoovered me out.

57
00:03:13,686 --> 00:03:16,656
Mom was no genius,
but she was smart enough

58
00:03:16,689 --> 00:03:18,992
to realize that
18 years of child support

59
00:03:18,992 --> 00:03:21,294
was better than a couple of weeks
on his dumb show,

60
00:03:21,327 --> 00:03:23,129
so I got to
stick around.

61
00:03:23,163 --> 00:03:25,699
What Mom didn't count on
was the prick having a heart attack

62
00:03:25,732 --> 00:03:27,300
and croaking
a year after I was born.

63
00:03:30,036 --> 00:03:33,306
Look at me...
see what a happy baby I was?

64
00:03:33,339 --> 00:03:36,209
That's because I wasn't old enough
to understand why she had me.

65
00:03:39,179 --> 00:03:41,247
Here's me
on my first day of school.

66
00:03:41,281 --> 00:03:42,882
Why am I smiling?

67
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:44,551
Because I got to spend
seven hours a day

68
00:03:44,584 --> 00:03:47,454
with adults who didn't reek
of menthols and cheap Scotch.

69
00:03:51,324 --> 00:03:53,259
That's me at my friend
Kayla's house.

70
00:03:53,293 --> 00:03:55,595
There weren't
any sleepovers at my house.

71
00:03:55,628 --> 00:03:58,098
I couldn't risk it after one
of the scumbags Mom brought home

72
00:03:58,131 --> 00:04:01,334
tried to feel me up
after she passed out.

73
00:04:01,368 --> 00:04:03,536
Kayla's dad
took this one, too.

74
00:04:03,536 --> 00:04:05,739
Mom was sucking off
her producer to get an audition

75
00:04:05,772 --> 00:04:07,540
for some lame show
called "Bikini Cove."

76
00:04:07,574 --> 00:04:09,776
Got there late
and missed the whole thing.

77
00:04:14,981 --> 00:04:16,683
Anyway, as far
as my graduation,

78
00:04:16,716 --> 00:04:18,852
this time she had a great excuse
for missing it.

79
00:04:18,885 --> 00:04:21,488
Mini! Mini!

80
00:04:25,392 --> 00:04:28,194
When I call you,
I expect you to answer.

81
00:04:28,228 --> 00:04:30,063
Sorry.

82
00:04:30,096 --> 00:04:32,232
Don't patronize me.

83
00:04:32,265 --> 00:04:34,968
- Sorry.
- If you're trying to get me to call you

84
00:04:35,001 --> 00:04:37,303
a spoiled little ungrateful bitch,
you're outta luck.

85
00:04:37,337 --> 00:04:39,272
I won't give you
the satisfaction.

86
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,208
Thanks, Mommy.

87
00:04:42,242 --> 00:04:44,778
I'm going out
and I need you to wait here

88
00:04:44,811 --> 00:04:46,746
for a delivery
from the liquor store.

89
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,515
He should be here
by 7:00.

90
00:04:48,548 --> 00:04:50,784
Fine.

91
00:04:50,817 --> 00:04:52,752
Hmm.

92
00:04:54,854 --> 00:04:57,257
You should know that skirt
makes your thighs look fat.

93
00:04:58,925 --> 00:05:00,727
Gosh, you're right, Mom.

94
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,562
I'm such a cow.

95
00:05:02,595 --> 00:05:06,466
Honey, if I don't
tell you these things,

96
00:05:06,499 --> 00:05:08,134
who will?

97
00:05:08,168 --> 00:05:10,403
- Okay. Thanks.
- You're welcome.

98
00:05:10,437 --> 00:05:12,238
It's funny how
my fat thighs

99
00:05:12,272 --> 00:05:14,841
never seemed to bother
what's-his-name from the liquor store.

100
00:05:14,874 --> 00:05:17,877
Hey, Mini.
How're you doing?

101
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:27,854
So Mom spent the next 12 years trying
to bag another elephant.

102
00:05:27,887 --> 00:05:30,590
Then five years ago,
she met Martin.

103
00:05:30,623 --> 00:05:33,293
He's a partner
at a public relation's firm,

104
00:05:33,326 --> 00:05:35,195
which is ironic
because I can't remember

105
00:05:35,228 --> 00:05:37,230
the last time they were seen
in public together,

106
00:05:37,263 --> 00:05:38,898
or had relations.

107
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,569
You're home early.

108
00:05:43,837 --> 00:05:45,705
Yeah, um...

109
00:05:45,739 --> 00:05:48,408
client canceled
our dinner.

110
00:05:48,441 --> 00:05:50,410
Protecting all those poor,
defenseless oil companies

111
00:05:50,443 --> 00:05:51,945
from those big bad
environmentalists?

112
00:05:51,978 --> 00:05:54,814
Well, somebody's gotta make
the payments on your Beamer.

113
00:05:54,848 --> 00:05:56,649
Is your mother home?

114
00:05:56,683 --> 00:05:58,818
No, she went to some party
off Beachwood.

115
00:05:58,852 --> 00:06:00,720
She was in one
of her happy moods,

116
00:06:00,754 --> 00:06:02,622
so I doubt
she'll be sleeping here,

117
00:06:02,655 --> 00:06:05,392
in case you were thinking
of inviting a guest over.

118
00:06:07,727 --> 00:06:09,996
I wasn't, but thanks
for your concern.

119
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:11,865
You're going out
on a school night?

120
00:06:11,898 --> 00:06:14,434
Yeah.

121
00:06:14,467 --> 00:06:16,236
Hmm.

122
00:06:16,269 --> 00:06:17,971
Have you finished
your homework?

123
00:06:18,004 --> 00:06:20,106
I haven't even
cracked a book.

124
00:06:21,307 --> 00:06:22,909
To understand me,

125
00:06:22,942 --> 00:06:25,311
you need to understand that life,
in my opinion,

126
00:06:25,345 --> 00:06:27,347
is all about
new experiences.

127
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,049
"Firsts" is what
I call them.

128
00:06:29,082 --> 00:06:31,184
And the goal of life...
any life...

129
00:06:31,184 --> 00:06:33,653
should be to cram
as many firsts into it as possible.

130
00:06:33,686 --> 00:06:36,389
After popping out of the cake,
I knew I had to top it,

131
00:06:36,423 --> 00:06:38,324
but it was tough...

132
00:06:38,358 --> 00:06:41,027
skydiving,
bungee jumping?

133
00:06:41,061 --> 00:06:44,197
Please. It's more dangerous getting
on the freeway every day.

134
00:06:45,899 --> 00:06:48,768
Then one night while cruising through
Hollywood, it hit me.

135
00:06:48,802 --> 00:06:51,738
So I went to an escort service just
to see what would happen.

136
00:06:51,771 --> 00:06:53,940
When they found out
how young I was,

137
00:06:53,973 --> 00:06:56,476
they told me they had
a trick for me that night.

138
00:06:56,509 --> 00:06:59,813
My first night as a call girl
was a serious letdown.

139
00:06:59,846 --> 00:07:02,248
The guy said I looked
so much like his niece,

140
00:07:02,282 --> 00:07:04,951
he just started whimpering
and praying for forgiveness.

141
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:19,132
Honey, what are you
doing here?

142
00:07:19,165 --> 00:07:22,035
Did you have fun
tonight, honey?

143
00:07:23,403 --> 00:07:25,839
For my first night
turning tricks,

144
00:07:25,872 --> 00:07:27,440
it could have
been better.

145
00:07:27,474 --> 00:07:29,709
That's nice.

146
00:07:29,743 --> 00:07:31,745
That's so nice.

147
00:07:41,054 --> 00:07:42,956
Nice, Mom.

148
00:07:42,989 --> 00:07:44,824
In my bed.

149
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:52,766
After that night,
I told the escort service,

150
00:07:52,799 --> 00:07:54,834
"No more clients
with a conscience."

151
00:07:54,868 --> 00:07:56,936
They were happy to oblige
with a last-minute gig

152
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:59,305
at a corporate fuckpad
an executive keeps.

153
00:08:00,573 --> 00:08:04,511
They said I was
just his type... young.

154
00:08:08,314 --> 00:08:09,716
It's open.

155
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:20,493
Hello?

156
00:08:20,527 --> 00:08:22,195
Can you fucking believe it?

157
00:08:25,065 --> 00:08:27,333
Uh, hi.

158
00:08:28,902 --> 00:08:30,704
Sorry I'm late.

159
00:08:30,737 --> 00:08:33,006
It's okay.

160
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,542
Mind if I freshen up?

161
00:08:35,575 --> 00:08:37,644
No, go right ahead.

162
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,282
My own stepdad?

163
00:08:42,315 --> 00:08:44,651
My first thought was
"How sick is he?"

164
00:08:44,684 --> 00:08:47,420
But then I started thinking,
"I'm one to talk,

165
00:08:47,454 --> 00:08:49,189
and well, why not?

166
00:08:49,222 --> 00:08:50,890
I mean, he isn't
my real dad,

167
00:08:50,924 --> 00:08:52,659
and talk about
a first."

168
00:08:52,692 --> 00:08:56,563
Then I thought, "If my mom can do
some strange guy in my bed,

169
00:08:56,596 --> 00:08:58,631
I can do her strange guy
in this bed."

170
00:08:58,665 --> 00:09:00,333
You doing okay
in there?

171
00:09:00,367 --> 00:09:03,803
Just peachy.

172
00:09:03,837 --> 00:09:07,273
Listen, sugar, would you mind
turning the lights off?

173
00:09:07,307 --> 00:09:09,376
See, I'm kinda new to all this
and a little shy.

174
00:09:09,409 --> 00:09:10,977
No problem,

175
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:14,047
but do you think maybe
we could get this show on the road?

176
00:09:27,627 --> 00:09:29,429
Now close your eyes.

177
00:09:30,897 --> 00:09:32,432
Come on.

178
00:09:34,401 --> 00:09:37,203
You won't
keep them shut for long.

179
00:09:39,806 --> 00:09:41,775
Just don't look around.

180
00:09:41,808 --> 00:09:44,277
Now, close your eyes.

181
00:10:06,766 --> 00:10:09,602
I literally couldn't feel
the ground under my feet...

182
00:10:09,636 --> 00:10:11,671
a first
to top all firsts.

183
00:10:11,705 --> 00:10:14,507
I knew I'd tell him one day,
but I wanted to savor it for a while.

184
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:17,110
Hey, you forgot
your keys.

185
00:10:17,143 --> 00:10:20,413
Oh well, here's to
immediate gratification.

186
00:10:29,489 --> 00:10:30,757
You were great.

187
00:10:32,425 --> 00:10:34,928
What?

188
00:10:42,102 --> 00:10:43,903
Oh...

189
00:11:38,925 --> 00:11:41,094
Suddenly, he was
coming home every night

190
00:11:41,127 --> 00:11:43,697
and even started asking me
about my homework.

191
00:11:44,731 --> 00:11:46,633
How're you doin',
kiddo?

192
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:48,702
How are you making out
with those math problems?

193
00:11:48,735 --> 00:11:52,706
'Cause, you know, if you ever need
any help, I could... you know.

194
00:11:52,739 --> 00:11:56,943
Actually, I was thinking about starting
a 401K plan at work.

195
00:11:56,976 --> 00:11:59,145
Could you help me pick
a good mutual fund?

196
00:12:05,685 --> 00:12:07,721
All you did
was kiss?

197
00:12:07,754 --> 00:12:09,456
Yeah, you don't
believe me?

198
00:12:09,456 --> 00:12:10,757
No, of course,
I believe you.

199
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:12,359
Yo, Kayla,
I got some more

200
00:12:12,392 --> 00:12:15,428
of what you were looking
for last Saturday night.

201
00:12:15,462 --> 00:12:17,230
Aw, yeah yeah.

202
00:12:18,832 --> 00:12:20,834
Actually, Troy,
I think you confused her

203
00:12:20,867 --> 00:12:23,069
with that senile, toothless
grandmother of yours.

204
00:12:23,103 --> 00:12:25,605
Come on, man.

205
00:12:25,638 --> 00:12:27,240
Yo, Mini,

206
00:12:27,273 --> 00:12:29,476
why don't you use that mouth
for something useful

207
00:12:29,509 --> 00:12:31,378
and suck my dick?

208
00:12:31,411 --> 00:12:32,812
Aw, yeah!

209
00:12:32,846 --> 00:12:34,314
All right.

210
00:12:35,315 --> 00:12:37,317
Hey!
What the fu...

211
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:39,686
Let me suck your dick, Troy.
You said I could.

212
00:12:39,719 --> 00:12:42,288
- Yo, this ain't funny!
- Come on, baby, take it out!

213
00:12:45,225 --> 00:12:46,926
I'm on my knees, Troy,
come on!

214
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,962
Jesus Christ, Mini!
What the fuck?

215
00:12:48,995 --> 00:12:50,096
God damn, Mini!

216
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:52,232
Wait, I almost had it.
I almost had it.

217
00:12:52,265 --> 00:12:53,867
Here it comes!

218
00:12:56,302 --> 00:12:58,471
What's wrong,
stage fright?

219
00:13:03,143 --> 00:13:04,577
Thank you.

220
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:32,305
I want you to know

221
00:13:32,338 --> 00:13:33,940
that I feel horrible.

222
00:13:35,408 --> 00:13:38,912
And not about what happened,
because that was an accident.

223
00:13:38,945 --> 00:13:41,147
But I just keep thinking

224
00:13:41,181 --> 00:13:44,184
I didn't know that
you were doing that.

225
00:13:44,217 --> 00:13:47,320
And I just wonder how
things might have been

226
00:13:47,354 --> 00:13:49,255
if you...

227
00:13:49,289 --> 00:13:51,791
had a real father.

228
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,029
So what are
you saying, Martin?

229
00:13:56,062 --> 00:13:58,298
You wanna be
my father now?

230
00:14:05,105 --> 00:14:06,840
To be perfectly honest,

231
00:14:06,873 --> 00:14:08,875
I loved it.
Talk about electric.

232
00:14:08,908 --> 00:14:10,844
Knowing that any moment
she could walk in

233
00:14:10,877 --> 00:14:12,512
was better
than any drug.

234
00:14:37,904 --> 00:14:41,274
Mom thought it was cute
how we'd suddenly grown so close,

235
00:14:41,307 --> 00:14:45,712
and thought it was wonderful how Martin
had taken an interest in my education.

236
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:57,057
Mini? Mini?

237
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:59,025
What, you don't know
how to knock?

238
00:14:59,059 --> 00:15:00,527
Have you seen Martin?

239
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,328
No, I can't say
that I have.

240
00:15:02,362 --> 00:15:05,832
He was in his study,
but I haven't been able to find him.

241
00:15:05,865 --> 00:15:09,302
I assume he's gone out, so I've invited
Ricardo over for a cocktail,

242
00:15:09,335 --> 00:15:11,371
and you know how
children make him feel very uneasy.

243
00:15:11,404 --> 00:15:13,206
So I would really
appreciate it

244
00:15:13,239 --> 00:15:16,643
if you and your friend
would stay in here

245
00:15:16,676 --> 00:15:19,279
or use the backdoor
when he arrives.

246
00:15:19,312 --> 00:15:22,649
Okay, not a problem.

247
00:15:22,682 --> 00:15:24,651
Good.

248
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:41,801
Oh my God!

249
00:15:47,273 --> 00:15:49,576
Now that we were
spending time together,

250
00:15:49,609 --> 00:15:52,445
I actually started to find out
what Martin was like for the first time.

251
00:15:59,052 --> 00:16:01,021
He wasn't the drip
I thought he was.

252
00:16:02,489 --> 00:16:04,424
He was funny...

253
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:07,494
charming...

254
00:16:07,527 --> 00:16:09,295
sweet...

255
00:16:09,295 --> 00:16:11,197
and even a little shy.

256
00:16:14,868 --> 00:16:18,338
Looking back, that may have been
the moment he fell in love.

257
00:16:27,614 --> 00:16:30,150
This went on
for about two months

258
00:16:30,183 --> 00:16:32,318
before we had the talk
we both knew was coming.

259
00:16:46,733 --> 00:16:48,935
So...

260
00:16:48,968 --> 00:16:50,870
So...

261
00:16:56,743 --> 00:16:59,212
I don't want to sneak around
in my own house.

262
00:16:59,245 --> 00:17:01,314
Well, I don't think
telling her is such a hot idea.

263
00:17:01,348 --> 00:17:03,883
I don't even want to live
under the same roof with her anymore.

264
00:17:03,917 --> 00:17:05,919
You can't leave.
She'll get half.

265
00:17:09,522 --> 00:17:12,592
Can I ask how the hell
you married her without a prenup?

266
00:17:12,592 --> 00:17:15,929
She wasn't as bad
of an actress as you think.

267
00:17:20,567 --> 00:17:22,702
Well, there is
another option.

268
00:17:27,073 --> 00:17:28,675
And what's that?

269
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:31,578
Lt'll take some planning,
some resolve.

270
00:17:36,016 --> 00:17:38,818
- You wanna kill her?
- Yeah.

271
00:17:40,653 --> 00:17:43,289
No! Of course not,
she's my mother.

272
00:17:43,323 --> 00:17:45,725
Good, I'm glad
to hear you say that.

273
00:17:47,927 --> 00:17:49,729
But I was thinking...

274
00:17:49,763 --> 00:17:52,032
if she suddenly got ill...

275
00:17:52,065 --> 00:17:54,501
- III?
...unstable...

276
00:17:54,534 --> 00:17:56,836
unpredictable...

277
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:58,938
irrational...

278
00:17:58,972 --> 00:18:02,509
dangerous, and the safety
of her husband...

279
00:18:02,542 --> 00:18:04,944
her child...?

280
00:18:04,944 --> 00:18:06,746
She'd have to be
sent someplace

281
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:09,082
where they could give her
the care she needs.

282
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:12,585
Yeah.

283
00:18:12,619 --> 00:18:15,488
And it would be
for her own good.

284
00:18:15,522 --> 00:18:17,223
Yeah.

285
00:18:17,257 --> 00:18:21,227
As painful as it would be to be away
from my loving wife.

286
00:18:21,261 --> 00:18:23,830
Well, you did it for the well-being
of your daughter...

287
00:18:23,863 --> 00:18:26,966
the selfless act
of a devoted parent.

288
00:18:31,504 --> 00:18:35,241
We'll find her a very comfortable place
out in the country.

289
00:18:36,543 --> 00:18:38,011
With lots
of fresh air.

290
00:18:38,044 --> 00:18:40,947
It'll be a much
better life for her.

291
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,416
So much better.

292
00:18:54,561 --> 00:18:58,164
I awoke the next morning
as excited as I could remember.

293
00:18:59,499 --> 00:19:01,634
Unlike most firsts
which are over too quickly,

294
00:19:01,668 --> 00:19:04,170
this would take
determination...

295
00:19:05,238 --> 00:19:07,374
stamina...

296
00:19:08,608 --> 00:19:10,677
and imagination.

297
00:19:12,512 --> 00:19:14,814
I decided
to start simply.

298
00:19:16,316 --> 00:19:19,352
The school nurse, a lush
named Helga Hauptfuhrer...

299
00:19:19,386 --> 00:19:21,821
or "Der Führer," as she was
affectionately known...

300
00:19:21,855 --> 00:19:24,391
starts jonesing
for her afternoon nip

301
00:19:24,424 --> 00:19:26,826
about 45 minutes
after lunch each day...

302
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:31,498
which leaves me free to help
myself to the candy store.

303
00:19:36,503 --> 00:19:39,139
Slipping her the pills
was absurdly easy,

304
00:19:39,172 --> 00:19:42,208
because for Mom,
every morning was Margaritaville

305
00:19:42,242 --> 00:19:44,310
and I was
her bartender.

306
00:19:51,918 --> 00:19:54,320
It was even easier
when the sun went down.

307
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,989
Mini, Diane,
I'm home.

308
00:19:56,022 --> 00:19:58,925
I turned her nightcap
into an all-nightcap.

309
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:00,593
And after three days
of this,

310
00:20:00,627 --> 00:20:02,362
the fireworks were
about to begin.

311
00:20:02,395 --> 00:20:04,497
Peggy from Hays, Kansas.

312
00:20:05,865 --> 00:20:07,500
Phase one:

313
00:20:07,534 --> 00:20:10,236
Violent mood swings-
slash-uncontrollable rages.

314
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:11,938
God damn it.

315
00:20:11,971 --> 00:20:13,840
Damn it! God damn it!

316
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,143
Where are they?
I'm gonna be late!

317
00:20:17,177 --> 00:20:18,645
Fucking shit!

318
00:20:18,678 --> 00:20:21,147
Where the fuck are they?

319
00:20:21,181 --> 00:20:25,185
It took me three weeks
to get the appointment with Fabrizio!

320
00:20:25,218 --> 00:20:28,955
Fabrizio Santano:
Masseuse to the stars

321
00:20:28,988 --> 00:20:31,825
and reported possessor
of one of the biggest schlongs in town.

322
00:20:31,858 --> 00:20:33,660
Rumor has it
he's pourin' the pork

323
00:20:33,693 --> 00:20:36,363
to every rich wife
between Malibu and Pasadena.

324
00:20:36,396 --> 00:20:38,198
Now I'm gonna miss it

325
00:20:38,231 --> 00:20:40,567
because I can't find
my fucking keys!

326
00:20:41,868 --> 00:20:44,170
I could use
a little help over here!

327
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:52,245
Diane, do you remember
where you left your keys

328
00:20:52,278 --> 00:20:54,114
when you came home
last night?

329
00:20:54,147 --> 00:20:58,118
Oh yeah, I put them
in the fucking bowl

330
00:20:58,151 --> 00:21:01,421
next to the fucking door
like I always fucking do.

331
00:21:03,823 --> 00:21:05,992
Well, you were kind of
out of it last night.

332
00:21:09,095 --> 00:21:11,164
I was not.

333
00:21:11,197 --> 00:21:14,634
I had one drink
with Peggy... one!

334
00:21:14,667 --> 00:21:16,369
Are you sure
about that?

335
00:21:16,403 --> 00:21:19,172
- Yes, I'm sure.
- 'Cause you seemed a little bit too...

336
00:21:21,608 --> 00:21:23,777
Dickless wonder.

337
00:21:24,744 --> 00:21:26,546
Mini, I'm taking
your car.

338
00:21:26,579 --> 00:21:28,815
Martin, you drive her
to school.

339
00:21:28,848 --> 00:21:31,851
- I've got a meeting with Chapman.
- Tell him it's an emergency.

340
00:21:31,885 --> 00:21:34,554
- He's one of our biggest clients!
- Who gives a fuck?

341
00:21:38,992 --> 00:21:41,494
You're not a dickless wonder.

342
00:21:42,495 --> 00:21:44,064
Thank you.

343
00:21:51,004 --> 00:21:53,573
- Hello, Fabrizio?
- Yes, what is it?

344
00:21:53,606 --> 00:21:55,442
It's Diane.

345
00:21:55,475 --> 00:21:57,477
Diane Spechtenstein?

346
00:21:57,510 --> 00:22:00,080
- Tannen.
- Oh, I'll be seeing you shortly, no?

347
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,382
Listen, I'm going to have to
cancel our appointment.

348
00:22:02,415 --> 00:22:04,451
Aw, something come up?

349
00:22:04,484 --> 00:22:06,653
Yeah, something came up.

350
00:22:15,228 --> 00:22:16,863
Oh, that's so good.

351
00:22:21,134 --> 00:22:23,603
- Fabrizio.
- Ms. Tannen?

352
00:22:23,636 --> 00:22:26,973
- Jelena?
- Diane, what are you doing here?

353
00:22:27,007 --> 00:22:29,909
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Easy now, Ms. Tannen.

354
00:22:29,943 --> 00:22:32,746
You called.
You canceled 30 minutes ago.

355
00:22:32,779 --> 00:22:34,681
I did not call
and cancel, Fabrizio!

356
00:22:34,714 --> 00:22:37,751
I talked to you myself.
You said something come up.

357
00:22:37,784 --> 00:22:39,919
You knew I had
an appointment today.

358
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:41,488
Did you call
and pretend to be me?

359
00:22:41,521 --> 00:22:45,225
Are you drunk?
How could I possibly sound like you?

360
00:22:45,258 --> 00:22:46,893
Yeah, that's true.

361
00:22:46,926 --> 00:22:48,461
Five minutes,
Ms. Tannen.

362
00:22:48,495 --> 00:22:49,696
Bitch.

363
00:22:49,729 --> 00:22:52,499
Ms. Tannen,
wait in the recovery room.

364
00:22:52,532 --> 00:22:54,667
Fabrizio, I never need
the recovery room, you know that.

365
00:22:54,701 --> 00:22:56,369
Did I tell you
to stop?

366
00:22:56,403 --> 00:22:58,872
What part of "Don't stop"
didn't you understand?

367
00:22:58,905 --> 00:23:01,574
- Five minutes.
- But this is my appointment!

368
00:23:01,608 --> 00:23:03,476
Fabrizio, get off of her
right now!

369
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:06,346
I've got him
for 55 more minutes!

370
00:23:06,379 --> 00:23:10,150
- Wait your turn!
- It's my turn! It's my appointment!

371
00:23:10,183 --> 00:23:12,285
Look, if you're not
going to wait outside,

372
00:23:12,318 --> 00:23:13,987
at least shut
your goddamn mouth

373
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:16,222
and let me
enjoy this!

374
00:23:16,256 --> 00:23:18,591
- Get off of her!
- Don't you fucking talk to me!

375
00:23:18,625 --> 00:23:20,427
- Right now!
- Throw her out!

376
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,896
- Faster!
- Get off!

377
00:23:22,896 --> 00:23:25,465
Don't or I'll have immigration
up your ass!

378
00:23:25,498 --> 00:23:28,601
You sneaky little bitch!

379
00:23:34,974 --> 00:23:36,976
Do you think
she'll press charges?

380
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:40,080
Are you fucking kidding me?
She should get 20 to life.

381
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,383
When I told Peggy and Margo
about the stunt she pulled,

382
00:23:43,416 --> 00:23:45,852
both of them said they would have
ripped her eyes out.

383
00:23:45,885 --> 00:23:49,489
She'll be lucky
if anybody talks to her again.

384
00:23:49,522 --> 00:23:51,758
Here comes
the choo-choo.

385
00:23:51,791 --> 00:23:55,328
For God's sake,
I didn't break both hands!

386
00:23:57,230 --> 00:24:00,400
God, I still can't
believe you broke your hand on her face.

387
00:24:00,433 --> 00:24:02,802
That's so Linda Hamilton.

388
00:24:02,836 --> 00:24:05,405
I hope she enjoys shitting
out the teeth she swallowed.

389
00:24:24,758 --> 00:24:26,659
Phase two:

390
00:24:26,693 --> 00:24:29,829
Wild shopping sprees carried
out in a euphoric state.

391
00:24:31,664 --> 00:24:33,700
Divine Productions,
Carlos speaking.

392
00:24:33,733 --> 00:24:35,669
Hello, Carlos.
It's Diane Tannen calling.

393
00:24:35,702 --> 00:24:38,071
Señora Tannen.

394
00:24:38,104 --> 00:24:40,840
Listen, I'm going to need
a delivery to the house.

395
00:24:44,477 --> 00:24:47,313
Hey, where do you
want these?

396
00:24:47,347 --> 00:24:49,349
I don't know.
My mom ordered them.

397
00:24:49,382 --> 00:24:51,117
The eucalyptus pods
and bamboo and...

398
00:24:51,151 --> 00:24:54,954
The giraffe can
clean its own ears with its tongue

399
00:24:54,988 --> 00:24:58,825
because the tongue is approximately 21"
long. Is that true or false?

400
00:24:58,858 --> 00:25:00,694
Carlos?! What...?

401
00:25:01,795 --> 00:25:04,397
What the fuck is
going on, Carlos?

402
00:25:04,431 --> 00:25:07,634
Oh, Señora Tannen, it's the stuff
you ordered for the party yesterday.

403
00:25:07,667 --> 00:25:09,336
Ordered? I didn't
order anything!

404
00:25:09,369 --> 00:25:11,204
What the fuck are you
talking about?

405
00:25:11,237 --> 00:25:13,073
- Are you invited?
- I don't think it's a party.

406
00:25:13,106 --> 00:25:15,475
I think they're having
a family event...

407
00:25:15,508 --> 00:25:18,611
a dysfunctional circus.

408
00:25:18,645 --> 00:25:20,246
Mom, look at
the monkey.

409
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,949
You did. You called me
yesterday on the phone. We talked.

410
00:25:22,982 --> 00:25:24,851
I didn't call you!
I did not!

411
00:25:24,884 --> 00:25:27,053
You were talking about
a party on the phone.

412
00:25:27,087 --> 00:25:29,255
Right after you washed
your painkillers...

413
00:25:29,289 --> 00:25:31,091
- Shh!
- Right.

414
00:25:31,124 --> 00:25:33,026
- I didn't...
- You said you wanted...

415
00:25:33,059 --> 00:25:35,128
...organize a party, Carlos!
- Shangri-la,

416
00:25:35,161 --> 00:25:37,630
- that's what you said to me.
- Shangri-la, oh yeah.

417
00:25:37,664 --> 00:25:39,799
One, two, three.

418
00:25:39,833 --> 00:25:41,568
I'm coming, I'm coming!

419
00:25:41,601 --> 00:25:43,603
And you're not gonna be
helping me ever again,

420
00:25:43,636 --> 00:25:45,171
because you know what?
You suck.

421
00:25:47,607 --> 00:25:49,142
Oh shit!

422
00:25:51,511 --> 00:25:54,614
What the fuck is
going on here, Carlos?

423
00:25:54,647 --> 00:25:56,583
Who ordered
all this stuff?

424
00:25:56,616 --> 00:25:58,118
I didn't order it.

425
00:25:58,151 --> 00:26:00,153
I wouldn't do anything
without your permission,

426
00:26:00,186 --> 00:26:02,088
but Mrs...
Señora Tannen...

427
00:26:02,122 --> 00:26:04,724
Martin, I...

428
00:26:04,758 --> 00:26:07,360
Diane...

429
00:26:08,461 --> 00:26:10,563
did you order
all this stuff?

430
00:26:10,597 --> 00:26:12,565
No, I didn't.

431
00:26:12,599 --> 00:26:14,901
I didn't order anything.

432
00:26:14,934 --> 00:26:16,636
Come inside with me,
Diane, because...

433
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:18,004
- come inside.
- I didn't order anything!

434
00:26:18,038 --> 00:26:19,906
Over the next few days,

435
00:26:19,939 --> 00:26:22,909
whenever Mom passed out
from too much drinky-drinky,

436
00:26:22,942 --> 00:26:25,278
I'd pull out her wallet
and reach out and touch someone.

437
00:26:25,311 --> 00:26:28,081
After a week of my version
of the Home Shopping Network,

438
00:26:28,114 --> 00:26:30,250
the doorbell might as well
have been a cannon.

439
00:26:35,121 --> 00:26:37,924
Oh God.

440
00:26:42,662 --> 00:26:45,432
Mini! Jesus Christ,

441
00:26:45,465 --> 00:26:47,133
I asked for that drink
10 minutes ago.

442
00:26:47,167 --> 00:26:48,935
Put it here.

443
00:26:48,968 --> 00:26:50,570
Help me.

444
00:26:50,603 --> 00:26:52,238
You're welcome.

445
00:26:52,272 --> 00:26:54,941
Jesus Christ.

446
00:26:58,578 --> 00:27:00,413
Anything else
I can do for you?

447
00:27:00,447 --> 00:27:02,082
Mm...

448
00:27:03,316 --> 00:27:05,852
Sweetie, that is yummy.

449
00:27:05,885 --> 00:27:07,787
What's in it?

450
00:27:16,129 --> 00:27:17,797
Phase three:

451
00:27:17,831 --> 00:27:20,633
Rambling
incoherent monologues in public.

452
00:27:20,667 --> 00:27:23,169
I just clammed up, you know,
It was just weird.

453
00:27:23,203 --> 00:27:25,238
You know, eventually
I just said to him,

454
00:27:25,271 --> 00:27:27,841
"Sorry, Fabrizio, but it's just not
a safe haven anymore."

455
00:27:27,874 --> 00:27:29,175
She has ruined it
for all of us.

456
00:27:29,209 --> 00:27:33,179
Oh boy, oh boy.
You know...

457
00:27:33,213 --> 00:27:35,815
- You know I love you!
- She looks so lovely, doesn't she?

458
00:27:35,849 --> 00:27:39,386
She looks lovely, but I'm gonna take out
a restraining order. I got news for you.

459
00:27:39,419 --> 00:27:41,654
What happened...
yeah, I heard about that incident.

460
00:27:41,688 --> 00:27:43,556
Here she comes.

461
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:46,926
Jelena, my God,
your dentist is a genius.

462
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,895
I'd never know those
weren't your real teeth.

463
00:27:48,928 --> 00:27:50,830
You stay the hell
away from me, you psycho,

464
00:27:50,864 --> 00:27:52,766
- You're lucky I didn't...
- I'm lucky? No no no no.

465
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:55,301
Let me tell you something:
Fabrizio will not return my calls

466
00:27:55,335 --> 00:27:57,203
because of you,
you fucking bitch!

467
00:27:57,237 --> 00:27:59,739
Let me tell you something:
That shit may fly in Siberia,

468
00:27:59,773 --> 00:28:02,075
but it does not fly
on Mulholland, you got it?!

469
00:28:02,108 --> 00:28:04,911
- She hit my wife.
- Really?

470
00:28:04,944 --> 00:28:06,346
Like I said,
get some help!

471
00:28:06,379 --> 00:28:07,580
Yeah well,
whatever.

472
00:28:07,614 --> 00:28:10,784
She's fucking
unbelievable!

473
00:28:10,817 --> 00:28:12,886
I'm telling you,
the best thing I ever did

474
00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:14,688
was break my hand
on that bitch's face.

475
00:28:14,721 --> 00:28:16,823
- Yeah.
- I think she's troubled, you know?

476
00:28:16,856 --> 00:28:19,459
She has a beautiful nose.
I love her nose.

477
00:28:19,492 --> 00:28:21,728
I feel fucking fantastic!

478
00:28:21,761 --> 00:28:23,630
Like, I feel like
I could run a marathon,

479
00:28:23,663 --> 00:28:26,132
- you know what I mean?
...each and every juror in the eye.

480
00:28:26,166 --> 00:28:27,834
Juries!

481
00:28:27,867 --> 00:28:30,704
Can I please come over
and talk to you about juries?

482
00:28:30,704 --> 00:28:34,007
I've always wanted to say
the words, "You're guilty!"

483
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:37,177
What do you guys think happens in those
sequestered situations?

484
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:40,180
Do you think they have sex, the jurors?
I think they really get it on.

485
00:28:40,213 --> 00:28:42,916
Are you looking
at my tits?

486
00:28:42,949 --> 00:28:44,818
You crazy fuck!

487
00:28:44,851 --> 00:28:46,219
Oh, you know,
I was an actress.

488
00:28:46,252 --> 00:28:47,887
I don't know if you
know that about me.

489
00:28:47,921 --> 00:28:50,323
I almost had this role
on "Bikini Cove."

490
00:28:50,357 --> 00:28:53,393
I almost had two lines.
My one line would have been this:

491
00:28:53,426 --> 00:28:55,829
"Um, I'll have another
sex on the beach."

492
00:28:55,862 --> 00:28:57,197
Mmm.

493
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:59,933
That show was a really
fucking fantastic show.

494
00:28:59,966 --> 00:29:02,602
It was very creative.
Cheesy drink, but it's a drink anyway.

495
00:29:02,635 --> 00:29:05,372
I like Scotch.
Isn't that fun?

496
00:29:05,405 --> 00:29:08,441
I had to suck off the executive producer
for that audition,

497
00:29:08,475 --> 00:29:09,943
but, hey, I almost got
my SAG card,

498
00:29:09,976 --> 00:29:11,578
- so I felt it was worth it.
- I need a refill.

499
00:29:11,611 --> 00:29:13,680
- Yeah, me too. If you'll excuse us...
- But we were talking

500
00:29:13,713 --> 00:29:16,349
- about juries and sex on the...
- Excuse me.

501
00:29:16,383 --> 00:29:18,618
You know, hey hey hey,
cock breath!

502
00:29:18,651 --> 00:29:20,720
Oh my God.

503
00:29:23,289 --> 00:29:25,392
Listen, good job,
but I need more warning.

504
00:29:25,392 --> 00:29:26,926
I was at dinner
with Chapman.

505
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,228
I can't
reschedule again.

506
00:29:28,261 --> 00:29:29,863
I know, but it was
a golden opportunity.

507
00:29:29,896 --> 00:29:31,765
You always said
you can't pay enough

508
00:29:31,798 --> 00:29:33,266
for good publicity, right?

509
00:29:33,299 --> 00:29:35,769
What the hell?
Can you control her, sir?

510
00:29:35,802 --> 00:29:39,339
Ooh!
Bye, everybody!

511
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:43,076
I'll see you later!

512
00:29:43,109 --> 00:29:45,412
At this point with
all those witnesses,

513
00:29:45,445 --> 00:29:48,114
Martin thought we could get a shrink
to have her sent away.

514
00:29:48,148 --> 00:29:50,050
My feeling was
that until they were ready

515
00:29:50,083 --> 00:29:52,052
to weld the door
to her padded cell shut,

516
00:29:52,085 --> 00:29:54,020
there was still
more work to be done.

517
00:29:55,622 --> 00:29:57,023
Fabrizio,
it's Diane.

518
00:29:57,057 --> 00:29:59,125
Hi...

519
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:02,228
Do you think you could call me?
I've called you a few times.

520
00:30:02,262 --> 00:30:04,164
I just...
I need to talk to you.

521
00:30:04,197 --> 00:30:05,899
Ciao.

522
00:30:08,768 --> 00:30:11,104
- Feel okay?
- Yeah, great.

523
00:30:11,137 --> 00:30:12,939
I'll be right back
with your two iced teas.

524
00:30:12,972 --> 00:30:15,475
So was there any reason
why we couldn't just meet at my house?

525
00:30:15,508 --> 00:30:18,578
Honestly, because I want
some witnesses around

526
00:30:18,611 --> 00:30:20,213
in case you fucking
lose it again.

527
00:30:20,246 --> 00:30:21,915
In case I...

528
00:30:21,948 --> 00:30:23,283
you're unbelievable,
Jelena.

529
00:30:23,316 --> 00:30:24,551
For God's sake,
get a grip.

530
00:30:24,584 --> 00:30:26,820
All the shit you've
been talking about me

531
00:30:26,853 --> 00:30:29,089
to Peggy, Barbara,
and Trish has to stop!

532
00:30:33,159 --> 00:30:34,828
After your performance
the other night,

533
00:30:34,861 --> 00:30:37,364
I can't believe I'm even
giving you a warning.

534
00:30:37,397 --> 00:30:39,232
- Ha! A warning?
- If you keep this up,

535
00:30:39,265 --> 00:30:42,168
- I will make my husband...
- Your husband? Oh right!

536
00:30:42,202 --> 00:30:43,870
- Give me a break!
...and mental anguish!

537
00:30:43,903 --> 00:30:45,038
Are we clear?

538
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,742
I'm, like, "Dude,
all I wanted was..."

539
00:30:48,775 --> 00:30:50,677
Hey, boys.

540
00:30:53,646 --> 00:30:55,081
Wanna have a little fun?

541
00:30:55,115 --> 00:30:57,384
- You are losing it.
- That's so funny, you know?

542
00:31:00,387 --> 00:31:01,955
Final phase:

543
00:31:01,988 --> 00:31:04,257
Complete
psychotic breakdown.

544
00:31:07,627 --> 00:31:09,996
- Hello?
- Diane.

545
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:13,099
Fabrizio, is that you?
How are you?

546
00:31:13,133 --> 00:31:15,468
I can see you.
Can you see me?

547
00:31:15,502 --> 00:31:17,070
Who is this?

548
00:31:17,103 --> 00:31:18,605
Do you feel safe?

549
00:31:19,939 --> 00:31:21,174
This isn't funny.
I'm hanging up.

550
00:31:21,207 --> 00:31:22,809
Hang up
and you're dead.

551
00:31:22,842 --> 00:31:26,312
- Is this a joke?
- I assure you I'm no joke.

552
00:31:26,346 --> 00:31:30,383
By the way, that pink scarf
is very fetching.

553
00:31:30,417 --> 00:31:32,519
Who is this?
Just...

554
00:31:33,887 --> 00:31:35,455
Take it easy!

555
00:31:35,488 --> 00:31:37,390
- Get away from me!
- What the hell is your problem?

556
00:31:37,424 --> 00:31:39,693
Leave me alone!
Leave me alone!

557
00:31:39,726 --> 00:31:42,696
Maybe you should make a run for that
silver Jag you drive home

558
00:31:42,729 --> 00:31:44,464
to Mira Loma Lane.

559
00:31:44,497 --> 00:31:46,666
- How do you know where I live?
- I know everything.

560
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:47,701
What do you
want from me?

561
00:31:47,734 --> 00:31:48,935
- Ma'am?
- What?

562
00:31:48,968 --> 00:31:50,904
I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave the mall.

563
00:31:50,937 --> 00:31:53,606
I-I can't leave.
He's...

564
00:31:54,908 --> 00:31:56,409
He knows where I live.
I can't.

565
00:31:56,443 --> 00:31:57,944
Who knows, ma'am?

566
00:31:57,977 --> 00:32:01,348
This man has been
terrorizing me on the phone.

567
00:32:02,982 --> 00:32:04,884
He's... hello?

568
00:32:04,918 --> 00:32:06,786
Yeah, this is Franklin.
We've got a code seven.

569
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:08,588
- You've gotta come with me.
- Don't touch!

570
00:32:08,621 --> 00:32:10,824
- Ma'am?
- Don't you dare touch me!

571
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,395
Settle down.

572
00:32:21,134 --> 00:32:22,402
Hey, get off of her!

573
00:32:24,771 --> 00:32:26,206
The other arm!

574
00:32:26,239 --> 00:32:28,341
Get the cuffs on her!

575
00:32:28,375 --> 00:32:29,776
Come on, ma'am!

576
00:32:34,347 --> 00:32:36,583
After her performance
at the mall,

577
00:32:36,616 --> 00:32:39,619
I'm sure she would have qualified as
committable, but that wasn't enough.

578
00:32:39,652 --> 00:32:42,288
I wanted her to beg the boys
in white coats to take her away.

579
00:32:42,322 --> 00:32:44,124
So, Mom, we're gonna
go out to dinner.

580
00:32:44,157 --> 00:32:45,992
Do you want us
to bring you back something?

581
00:32:46,026 --> 00:32:48,294
Are you both going?

582
00:32:48,328 --> 00:32:50,263
Why don't you just
come with us?

583
00:32:50,296 --> 00:32:52,432
You haven't left
the house in three days.

584
00:32:54,134 --> 00:32:56,069
I can't.

585
00:32:57,137 --> 00:32:58,972
Okay.

586
00:33:11,751 --> 00:33:13,486
Hello?

587
00:33:24,064 --> 00:33:25,799
Hello?

588
00:33:28,368 --> 00:33:30,070
Hello?

589
00:33:33,573 --> 00:33:34,974
Oh my God!

590
00:33:38,511 --> 00:33:40,046
Shit.

591
00:33:41,481 --> 00:33:42,849
What do you want?!

592
00:33:42,882 --> 00:33:45,485
Oh my God!
Oh my God!

593
00:33:45,518 --> 00:33:48,021
Shit!
Oh, please, God!

594
00:33:48,054 --> 00:33:51,725
- Please... ma'am?
- 911 emergency, please hold.

595
00:33:51,758 --> 00:33:53,827
Fuck fuck fuck!

596
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:56,196
Oh my God!
Oh my God!

597
00:33:56,229 --> 00:33:58,365
Oh my God,
oh my God!

598
00:33:58,398 --> 00:33:59,632
Shit, oh my God.
Oh my God!

599
00:34:02,035 --> 00:34:03,903
Oh God!

600
00:34:04,871 --> 00:34:06,473
Oh, shit!

601
00:34:06,506 --> 00:34:08,208
Oh God! Shit!

602
00:34:09,242 --> 00:34:11,778
Help!

603
00:34:11,811 --> 00:34:13,580
Oh my God,
oh my God!

604
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:25,859
Our work finished.

605
00:34:25,892 --> 00:34:29,129
We returned home expecting to find her
blabbering like a three-year-old.

606
00:34:31,231 --> 00:34:33,066
Mom, we're home.

607
00:34:33,099 --> 00:34:34,968
Diane, honey...

608
00:34:36,102 --> 00:34:38,204
we brought you
a pulled pork plate.

609
00:34:45,378 --> 00:34:47,547
Diane, wake up.
It's us.

610
00:34:49,582 --> 00:34:51,017
Wake up, Mommy.

611
00:34:51,051 --> 00:34:52,986
Diane, come on.

612
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,989
Diane, come on,
wake up.

613
00:35:00,093 --> 00:35:02,862
Martin, I just picked these sleeping
pills up for her yesterday.

614
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:06,566
I suppose we should
call an ambulance.

615
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:08,835
Do you really think
they can save her?

616
00:35:08,868 --> 00:35:10,370
I don't know.

617
00:35:10,403 --> 00:35:13,273
She'll only try it again,
you know she will.

618
00:35:13,306 --> 00:35:15,208
She will if we keep
torturing her like this.

619
00:35:15,241 --> 00:35:17,277
Mini, this is wrong.
I'm gonna call an ambulance.

620
00:35:18,645 --> 00:35:20,046
Hold on,
wait wait wait.

621
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,849
Who are we to say
her choice is wrong?

622
00:35:22,882 --> 00:35:25,051
She put the pills
in her mouth.

623
00:35:26,286 --> 00:35:28,588
I thought we agreed
that murder was out.

624
00:35:28,621 --> 00:35:31,257
I wouldn't exactly
call this murder.

625
00:35:31,291 --> 00:35:34,427
I mean, if anything, we're just helping
to fulfill her last wish.

626
00:35:34,461 --> 00:35:36,896
Mini, she wouldn't have
done this unless we...

627
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:38,965
Mini, for God's sake,
the woman still has a pulse.

628
00:35:38,999 --> 00:35:41,401
All right, look, you can
cut the indignant outrage,

629
00:35:41,434 --> 00:35:44,304
because if you really cared, you would
have already dialed 911.

630
00:35:46,706 --> 00:35:49,576
Can't we just admit
how lucky we both are?

631
00:35:49,609 --> 00:35:52,912
This is the perfect alibi...
she put the drugs in her system.

632
00:35:52,946 --> 00:35:55,982
You're saying we should
just leave her here.

633
00:35:56,016 --> 00:35:58,852
Can you think of one person
who would say she's sane at this point?

634
00:36:01,621 --> 00:36:03,790
We're so close
to being free.

635
00:36:03,823 --> 00:36:06,593
Let's just let nature
take its course.

636
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:13,867
So we passed the time
watching my favorite show.

637
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:16,703
Our first couple's
from Bakersfield, California...

638
00:36:16,736 --> 00:36:19,706
Suzanne Terasado
and Gene Scalzo.

639
00:36:19,739 --> 00:36:21,941
They're gonna get married
in three weeks, folks.

640
00:36:21,975 --> 00:36:23,476
Date's coming up
pretty soon, huh?

641
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:25,245
Don't answer that question.
But first,

642
00:36:25,278 --> 00:36:26,880
we send you out
on some dates huh?

643
00:36:40,427 --> 00:36:42,862
- We have to speed this up.
- What?

644
00:36:42,896 --> 00:36:46,633
We can't wait anymore,
Martin, okay?

645
00:36:46,666 --> 00:36:49,135
Our alibi's only believable
for maybe another hour.

646
00:36:49,169 --> 00:36:51,705
We can say
we went to a movie after dinner,

647
00:36:51,738 --> 00:36:54,407
but if she doesn't croak by midnight,
we can forget about this.

648
00:36:54,441 --> 00:36:58,645
What exactly
are you suggesting?

649
00:37:05,485 --> 00:37:07,387
Come on,
we don't have time.

650
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:09,322
Look, if we're gonna
screw up the details,

651
00:37:09,356 --> 00:37:12,325
we might as well call San Quentin
and tell them to fire up the Dutch oven.

652
00:37:15,962 --> 00:37:17,931
You almost finished?

653
00:37:17,964 --> 00:37:19,833
What's the one thing
all her friends

654
00:37:19,866 --> 00:37:22,002
are gonna be talking about
when they find out?

655
00:37:22,035 --> 00:37:24,270
"How did she look?"

656
00:37:24,304 --> 00:37:27,140
Do you think anyone would think twice if
the answer's "Fabulous"?

657
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:36,683
Well, if you have
any last thoughts,

658
00:37:36,716 --> 00:37:39,886
I think that now would probably be
the appropriate time.

659
00:37:41,321 --> 00:37:44,024
You could pretend
to have a little remorse.

660
00:37:59,005 --> 00:38:01,975
No no no! Wait wait wait!
She's gonna be fine!

661
00:38:02,008 --> 00:38:03,910
Just tell me that
she's gonna be okay!

662
00:38:03,943 --> 00:38:06,279
Mr. Tannen, I think you should take
your daughter into the house.

663
00:38:06,312 --> 00:38:08,648
I don't wanna go
in the house right now!

664
00:38:08,682 --> 00:38:10,517
She's gonna
be fine, right?

665
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:12,452
Just say that
she's gonna be fine first

666
00:38:12,485 --> 00:38:14,054
and then I'll go
in the house!

667
00:38:14,087 --> 00:38:16,189
It's gonna be okay.
Come on, go inside.

668
00:38:21,461 --> 00:38:23,897
All right, we're almost
wrapped up in here.

669
00:38:25,165 --> 00:38:27,067
I'll see you tomorrow.

670
00:38:31,871 --> 00:38:34,307
- Mr. Tannen.
- Oh.

671
00:38:34,341 --> 00:38:37,077
- Yes.
- Hi.

672
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:39,579
Detective
Dwight Garson, L.A.P.D.

673
00:38:39,612 --> 00:38:42,849
I'm very sorry
to be here right now,

674
00:38:42,882 --> 00:38:45,952
but, you know, whenever there's
an apparent suicide,

675
00:38:45,986 --> 00:38:47,887
we're required to do
an investigation

676
00:38:47,887 --> 00:38:49,656
just to rule out
homicide.

677
00:38:49,689 --> 00:38:52,959
- Right.
- It's really just a formality.

678
00:38:52,993 --> 00:38:55,595
Formality?

679
00:38:55,628 --> 00:38:58,098
My mother just
killed herself.

680
00:38:58,131 --> 00:39:00,734
They haven't even taken her away yet.
What's wrong with you?

681
00:39:00,767 --> 00:39:02,669
Mini, honey, the man
is just doing his job.

682
00:39:02,702 --> 00:39:05,472
I don't care.
Tell him to leave. This is outrageous.

683
00:39:05,505 --> 00:39:07,941
- Could we do this some other time?
- Of course, Mr. Tannen.

684
00:39:07,974 --> 00:39:09,175
I appreciate that.
Thank you.

685
00:39:09,209 --> 00:39:11,578
But I will need to ask you

686
00:39:11,611 --> 00:39:13,980
just a few simple questions
before I leave, if that's okay.

687
00:39:14,014 --> 00:39:16,282
- Okay.
- I'm sorry, but did you hear him?

688
00:39:16,316 --> 00:39:17,884
I believe he said
you need to leave.

689
00:39:17,917 --> 00:39:19,419
Mini, let's go
to your room,

690
00:39:19,452 --> 00:39:21,788
and you lie down for a little while,
please. Come on.

691
00:39:24,924 --> 00:39:27,093
So after dinner
and the movie,

692
00:39:27,127 --> 00:39:30,997
we came home at 11:30
and found her in the garage,

693
00:39:31,031 --> 00:39:33,800
and I... turned off
the car,

694
00:39:33,833 --> 00:39:35,702
and I opened
the garage door

695
00:39:35,735 --> 00:39:38,638
to let the fumes out.

696
00:39:40,173 --> 00:39:43,243
So... your wife
would have done this

697
00:39:43,276 --> 00:39:47,113
sometime between
8:00 and 11:33

698
00:39:47,147 --> 00:39:49,683
when you made
the 911 call?

699
00:39:49,716 --> 00:39:52,752
- Yes.
- So this was your wife's car?

700
00:39:52,752 --> 00:39:54,387
Yes.

701
00:39:54,421 --> 00:39:56,856
And...

702
00:39:56,890 --> 00:40:00,260
was it in the garage
when you went to dinner

703
00:40:00,293 --> 00:40:01,895
or did she drive it in?

704
00:40:01,928 --> 00:40:05,131
- Is that important?
- Oh well, you know,

705
00:40:05,165 --> 00:40:07,901
I'm just kind of trying
to reconstruct what happened.

706
00:40:07,934 --> 00:40:10,704
Well, when my wife
came home from the mall,

707
00:40:10,704 --> 00:40:14,107
we had the car towed here
and we put it in the garage.

708
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:16,042
Well, if it's okay,

709
00:40:16,076 --> 00:40:18,745
I'm gonna have them
impound it,

710
00:40:18,778 --> 00:40:20,947
and we'll take it
down to the crime lab.

711
00:40:20,981 --> 00:40:22,816
Take it down
to the crime lab?

712
00:40:22,849 --> 00:40:25,051
Yeah, again, you know,
it's just purely routine.

713
00:40:25,085 --> 00:40:27,020
Right.

714
00:40:29,222 --> 00:40:30,824
Yeah...

715
00:40:30,857 --> 00:40:33,059
so, uh...

716
00:40:34,527 --> 00:40:37,931
have you... have you
found a note yet?

717
00:40:41,501 --> 00:40:43,303
You mean
a suicide note?

718
00:40:43,336 --> 00:40:47,607
Yeah, usually the deceased
tend to leave one.

719
00:40:49,075 --> 00:40:51,878
Uh no no,
we haven't,

720
00:40:51,911 --> 00:40:54,314
but we haven't been
looking for one either.

721
00:40:54,347 --> 00:40:56,216
Right.

722
00:40:56,249 --> 00:40:58,485
Right...

723
00:40:59,919 --> 00:41:02,789
Well, do you mind
if I have a look around?

724
00:41:02,822 --> 00:41:05,291
No no no.

725
00:41:12,332 --> 00:41:14,401
Who cares if we
didn't leave a note?

726
00:41:14,434 --> 00:41:16,336
- Just relax!
- He says...

727
00:41:16,336 --> 00:41:18,071
So what? He'll do
his little dance,

728
00:41:18,104 --> 00:41:19,839
and chalk it up
to another failed actress

729
00:41:19,873 --> 00:41:21,908
who realized after 40
she might as well be dead.

730
00:41:21,941 --> 00:41:23,843
Okay.

731
00:41:24,911 --> 00:41:26,913
- Shit!
- What?

732
00:41:26,946 --> 00:41:29,382
I forgot about the sweatsuits
and the goggles.

733
00:41:29,416 --> 00:41:30,984
I already snuck out back
and threw them

734
00:41:31,017 --> 00:41:32,319
in Mike Rudell's
garbage cans.

735
00:41:34,954 --> 00:41:38,158
Good. Very good.

736
00:41:38,191 --> 00:41:40,527
Just relax.

737
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,162
We did it.

738
00:41:44,397 --> 00:41:45,832
We're free.

739
00:42:12,025 --> 00:42:14,894
Before that, I was actually
working in catering,

740
00:42:14,928 --> 00:42:17,230
but I discovered I had
this amazing talent

741
00:42:17,263 --> 00:42:19,366
to read people's flower auras.
If I may just...

742
00:42:20,934 --> 00:42:22,869
Venus flytrap.

743
00:42:22,902 --> 00:42:24,704
You scared me.

744
00:42:25,805 --> 00:42:27,607
Just keep 'em coming.

745
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:30,143
It's a tragic tragic loss.

746
00:42:30,176 --> 00:42:32,112
- Thank you so much.
- Is this soy?

747
00:42:32,145 --> 00:42:34,447
- You know, this could be tofurkey.
- Not for me.

748
00:42:34,481 --> 00:42:36,683
Is this tofurkey?
It could be okay.

749
00:42:39,919 --> 00:42:42,522
- It's good.
- You're so delighted by small things.

750
00:42:42,555 --> 00:42:46,126
Mm. Does anybody know how...
how is Mini doing?

751
00:42:46,159 --> 00:42:48,128
I hear she's
totally devastated.

752
00:42:48,161 --> 00:42:49,496
- She's... wh... what?
- Just look at her.

753
00:42:51,197 --> 00:42:53,466
Martin, I mean, think of him.
He's a single parent now.

754
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:56,703
He's going to need all the support
he can get from family and friends.

755
00:42:56,736 --> 00:42:58,505
Oh, it takes a village.

756
00:42:58,538 --> 00:42:59,973
The wake was a riot.

757
00:43:00,006 --> 00:43:02,275
With Mom out of the way,
Martin suddenly became

758
00:43:02,309 --> 00:43:03,810
prime target
number one.

759
00:43:03,843 --> 00:43:05,111
Would you excuse me?

760
00:43:05,145 --> 00:43:06,546
She wasn't even cold yet,

761
00:43:06,579 --> 00:43:08,281
and already her friends
were realizing

762
00:43:08,315 --> 00:43:10,116
whoever could dump
their hubbies the fastest

763
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:12,152
could actually marry someone
they'd want to sleep with.

764
00:43:12,185 --> 00:43:13,853
- Martin?
- Hi.

765
00:43:13,887 --> 00:43:15,555
How are you holding up?

766
00:43:15,588 --> 00:43:17,724
Well, the nights
are the roughest.

767
00:43:17,757 --> 00:43:20,927
I hope you know that despite our
little disagreement,

768
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,929
Diane was like
a sister to me.

769
00:43:22,962 --> 00:43:24,364
I know.

770
00:43:24,397 --> 00:43:28,034
And if you ever need
someone to talk to,

771
00:43:28,068 --> 00:43:29,703
or even just a hug...

772
00:43:31,204 --> 00:43:34,240
I can be over
in 10 minutes.

773
00:43:41,381 --> 00:43:43,116
After the funeral,

774
00:43:43,149 --> 00:43:45,185
I felt it would be a good idea if
we took a vacation,

775
00:43:45,218 --> 00:43:48,254
and went someplace where we can act
like a real couple for the first time.

776
00:44:17,651 --> 00:44:21,154
I could feel that Martin had let
that whole thing with the cops go.

777
00:44:31,831 --> 00:44:34,167
It had been two weeks
since Mom's death,

778
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,269
and already it felt like
it happened a year ago.

779
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:54,954
Martin? Mini?

780
00:44:54,988 --> 00:44:57,223
Hi. I thought
that was you.

781
00:44:57,257 --> 00:45:00,293
Mike, what are you
doing here?

782
00:45:00,327 --> 00:45:03,363
Uh, last week
Mini mentioned

783
00:45:03,396 --> 00:45:06,032
that you guys were gonna
come down here for a little R and R,

784
00:45:06,032 --> 00:45:08,968
and I suddenly realized
that I hadn't taken a vacation

785
00:45:09,002 --> 00:45:12,605
in God knows when.
Jennifer, this is Martin Tannen,

786
00:45:12,639 --> 00:45:14,975
my next-door neighbor
and his daughter Mini.

787
00:45:15,008 --> 00:45:16,676
And here's the kicker.

788
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:19,212
Jennifer works for
the same escort service that I did.

789
00:45:19,245 --> 00:45:20,947
I'm sorry, Jennifer,
but have we met?

790
00:45:20,981 --> 00:45:22,682
You look really familiar.

791
00:45:22,716 --> 00:45:24,617
I don't think so.

792
00:45:24,651 --> 00:45:26,686
No? Are you sure?
Have we worked together?

793
00:45:30,223 --> 00:45:33,460
That's impossible, because I just moved
here from Canada...

794
00:45:33,493 --> 00:45:35,962
the Yukon Territories.

795
00:45:39,632 --> 00:45:41,601
I just wanted
you both to know

796
00:45:41,634 --> 00:45:43,570
how sorry I am
for your loss.

797
00:45:43,603 --> 00:45:45,238
Our loss?

798
00:45:45,271 --> 00:45:47,307
He just lost six or seven freebies
a year from Mom.

799
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:49,509
Look at him.
He's a profile in courage.

800
00:45:49,542 --> 00:45:51,745
If there's anything
that I can do

801
00:45:51,778 --> 00:45:54,214
for either of you,

802
00:45:54,247 --> 00:45:56,683
don't hesitate to ask.

803
00:45:56,716 --> 00:46:00,353
Remember, I'm just...
I'm right across the fence.

804
00:46:01,688 --> 00:46:03,490
Thanks, Mike.

805
00:46:03,523 --> 00:46:05,191
We appreciate that.

806
00:46:05,225 --> 00:46:07,193
Breakfast tomorrow...
frittata.

807
00:46:07,227 --> 00:46:09,396
I'm sending over
a frittata for you guys.

808
00:46:09,429 --> 00:46:11,197
Don't be surprised.
Okay, bye-bye.

809
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:15,502
Why did you tell him?

810
00:46:15,535 --> 00:46:17,103
I was just being
friendly, okay?

811
00:46:17,137 --> 00:46:18,672
I didn't think
he'd actually come.

812
00:46:18,672 --> 00:46:21,608
He knows.
He found the goggles and the clothes,

813
00:46:21,641 --> 00:46:23,109
and he fuckin' knows.

814
00:46:23,143 --> 00:46:25,512
I doubt he even knows
where his trash cans are.

815
00:46:25,545 --> 00:46:27,781
Relax, it was
just a coincidence.

816
00:46:27,814 --> 00:46:30,250
Coincidence or not,
he saw us together.

817
00:46:30,283 --> 00:46:31,518
Let's go,
let's get in the car.

818
00:46:31,551 --> 00:46:33,253
- It was dark...
- Let's go to the airport.

819
00:46:33,286 --> 00:46:35,121
- It was dark outside.
- No no no no no.

820
00:46:35,155 --> 00:46:36,890
He was toying with us.
You didn't see that,

821
00:46:36,923 --> 00:46:38,325
the way that he was
toying with us?

822
00:46:38,358 --> 00:46:39,426
- No, I didn't.
- No?

823
00:46:39,459 --> 00:46:40,960
No.

824
00:46:40,994 --> 00:46:42,262
What is he
gonna do, huh?

825
00:46:42,295 --> 00:46:44,964
Go home and tell everyone
we're a couple?

826
00:46:44,998 --> 00:46:48,335
We'll just laugh it off
and say he vacations with hookers.

827
00:46:48,368 --> 00:46:49,769
Okay, thank you.

828
00:46:49,803 --> 00:46:51,604
Let's get in the car
and let's go to the airport now.

829
00:46:51,638 --> 00:46:52,806
- Come on.
- Martin, come on.

830
00:46:52,839 --> 00:46:55,175
Calm down, all right?
Nothing is going to happen.

831
00:46:55,208 --> 00:46:58,912
Let's just go inside
and have another drink, okay?

832
00:47:01,381 --> 00:47:03,149
- Aurelio?
- Sí, señorita?

833
00:47:03,183 --> 00:47:04,884
Hi, we're actually
gonna stay,

834
00:47:04,918 --> 00:47:06,553
so can you bring
these bags in for us?

835
00:47:06,586 --> 00:47:07,887
But of course.

836
00:47:22,135 --> 00:47:24,037
No thank you.

837
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:29,275
The next few days
were a real hoot.

838
00:47:29,309 --> 00:47:32,879
Suddenly, Martin was acting like
he really was my father.

839
00:47:52,065 --> 00:47:55,001
We returned home
and things didn't get much better.

840
00:47:55,035 --> 00:47:57,203
What little sex
we were having was getting dull.

841
00:47:57,237 --> 00:48:01,007
I tried spicing things up
with a little role-playing,

842
00:48:01,041 --> 00:48:03,677
but I was becoming concerned
that in my world of firsts,

843
00:48:03,710 --> 00:48:06,479
I'd achieved my greatest first
at too young an age.

844
00:48:13,086 --> 00:48:15,255
- Hi.
- Yes?

845
00:48:15,288 --> 00:48:17,691
Minerva Tannen,
Detective Garson.

846
00:48:17,724 --> 00:48:19,893
I don't know if you remember me
from that night.

847
00:48:19,926 --> 00:48:21,861
Drogues.
My last name is Drogues,

848
00:48:21,895 --> 00:48:24,230
and yes, I remember you.
You were the bighearted lug

849
00:48:24,264 --> 00:48:27,233
who wanted your questions answered
while my mother was still warm.

850
00:48:27,267 --> 00:48:30,236
Again, I'm sorry
about that night,

851
00:48:30,270 --> 00:48:32,806
but it is policy that
we get the preliminary facts

852
00:48:32,839 --> 00:48:34,541
as soon as possible.
Sorry.

853
00:48:34,574 --> 00:48:37,911
- What do you want?
- I need to ask you a few more questions

854
00:48:37,944 --> 00:48:39,412
about your mother's death.

855
00:48:41,181 --> 00:48:42,916
- All right, come in.
- Thank you.

856
00:48:42,949 --> 00:48:45,585
I know it's
stupid as hell

857
00:48:45,618 --> 00:48:47,287
to talk to a cop
without a lawyer,

858
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:48,888
but I didn't want
to look jumpy.

859
00:48:48,922 --> 00:48:51,224
At my first
real interrogation,

860
00:48:51,257 --> 00:48:53,927
I could literally feel
something tingle deep inside.

861
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:56,730
It's a little early
for the prom, isn't it?

862
00:48:56,763 --> 00:48:59,165
A girl can dream,
can't she?

863
00:48:59,199 --> 00:49:01,201
It's perfectly legal,
sure.

864
00:49:01,234 --> 00:49:02,936
So, anyway,

865
00:49:02,969 --> 00:49:05,872
we got the preliminary
coroner's report.

866
00:49:05,905 --> 00:49:09,009
Although the pills rendered
your mother unconscious,

867
00:49:09,042 --> 00:49:13,380
she died from the carbon monoxide
fumes from the exhaust.

868
00:49:13,413 --> 00:49:15,782
Is that important?

869
00:49:15,815 --> 00:49:19,853
Well, it's just
a little unusual

870
00:49:19,886 --> 00:49:22,188
for a suicide victim
to use two methods.

871
00:49:22,222 --> 00:49:25,725
Well, maybe she wanted
to drift off before the fumes got her.

872
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:28,828
Yeah, I suppose
you're right.

873
00:49:28,862 --> 00:49:31,498
We also got
the phone records

874
00:49:31,531 --> 00:49:33,833
and there was a 911 call
placed at 8:12.

875
00:49:33,867 --> 00:49:36,136
It was a hang up.

876
00:49:36,169 --> 00:49:38,238
- Really?
- Yeah.

877
00:49:38,271 --> 00:49:42,409
Any idea why your mom
might have called 911?

878
00:49:42,442 --> 00:49:44,210
Okay, fine.

879
00:49:44,244 --> 00:49:46,646
This may be the most exciting thing
I've done in a while,

880
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:48,948
but even I know
when the rush isn't worth the risk.

881
00:49:48,982 --> 00:49:51,951
Listen, Detective, I think you should
come back when my father's home.

882
00:49:51,951 --> 00:49:54,387
He'll probably be upset
that I let a stranger in the house.

883
00:49:56,523 --> 00:49:59,125
Yeah, I think
you're safe with me.

884
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:02,028
Even so,
he won't be happy.

885
00:50:02,062 --> 00:50:04,464
Not a problem.

886
00:50:04,464 --> 00:50:07,500
So will he
be back tonight?

887
00:50:07,534 --> 00:50:11,738
- I'll give him a call.
- Okay, thanks.

888
00:50:11,771 --> 00:50:14,641
And you let him in?

889
00:50:14,674 --> 00:50:17,177
It would have looked worse
to be defensive.

890
00:50:17,210 --> 00:50:19,579
And when's
he coming over?

891
00:50:19,612 --> 00:50:21,348
Tonight.

892
00:50:21,381 --> 00:50:23,984
Tonight?
I've got a dinner with Chapman.

893
00:50:24,017 --> 00:50:25,585
I've already canceled
on him twice.

894
00:50:25,618 --> 00:50:27,053
Damn it!
Why didn't you call me?

895
00:50:28,388 --> 00:50:30,490
I'm sorry.
I didn't know you had plans.

896
00:50:31,725 --> 00:50:33,293
All right, listen,
I'll be home early

897
00:50:33,326 --> 00:50:34,961
so we can get
our story straight, okay?

898
00:50:34,995 --> 00:50:37,430
Okay.

899
00:50:45,872 --> 00:50:48,475
I really do appreciate
you taking the time to help us out.

900
00:50:48,508 --> 00:50:51,144
You know, there's just a few
loose ends we need to tie up.

901
00:50:51,177 --> 00:50:53,813
Absolutely. What would
you like to know?

902
00:50:53,847 --> 00:50:56,716
Well, there seems
to be some question

903
00:50:56,750 --> 00:50:58,618
as to the time
of your wife's death.

904
00:50:58,652 --> 00:51:02,188
You said that you went
to dinner and a movie?

905
00:51:02,222 --> 00:51:05,659
Detective, I don't mean to sound
overly sensitive,

906
00:51:05,692 --> 00:51:07,260
but do I need
my attorney here?

907
00:51:07,293 --> 00:51:10,463
Because these sound like the questions
you would ask a suspect

908
00:51:10,497 --> 00:51:12,132
in a homicide
investigation.

909
00:51:12,165 --> 00:51:16,336
Well, Mr. Tannen, I really just kinda
wanna finish this up, you know?

910
00:51:16,369 --> 00:51:18,705
I have real homicides
that need my attention.

911
00:51:18,738 --> 00:51:21,875
So how about this?

912
00:51:21,908 --> 00:51:24,311
You know,
I'll ask you some questions,

913
00:51:24,344 --> 00:51:26,246
and the ones you
don't want to answer,

914
00:51:26,279 --> 00:51:28,214
well, we can
just skip those.

915
00:51:28,248 --> 00:51:30,550
Yeah, that sounds good,
doesn't it, Dad?

916
00:51:30,583 --> 00:51:32,652
Let's just get this
over with.

917
00:51:34,087 --> 00:51:35,622
Please go ahead.

918
00:51:35,655 --> 00:51:39,859
All right. You said that after dinner
you went to a movie?

919
00:51:39,893 --> 00:51:42,395
- That's right.
- Start time: 9:00.

920
00:51:42,429 --> 00:51:46,266
- What'd you see?
- We saw that Jackie Chan movie

921
00:51:46,299 --> 00:51:50,003
where he tries to stop the terrorists
from blowing up Mount Rushmore.

922
00:51:50,036 --> 00:51:52,205
Running time:
115 minutes.

923
00:51:52,238 --> 00:51:53,440
Yeah, a buddy of mine
saw it.

924
00:51:53,473 --> 00:51:55,241
He said that the ending
was pretty crazy.

925
00:51:55,275 --> 00:51:57,744
For God's sakes, does he think
we wouldn't actually see it?

926
00:51:57,777 --> 00:51:59,546
Yeah, they're sliding down
Washington's nose,

927
00:51:59,579 --> 00:52:00,981
and the guy's got
the bomb strapped in.

928
00:52:01,014 --> 00:52:02,649
Don't tell him.
He hasn't seen it yet.

929
00:52:02,682 --> 00:52:04,818
- Another demerit for me.
- Aw, that's okay.

930
00:52:04,851 --> 00:52:07,087
So, uh,
where'd you see it?

931
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:10,357
- The Galleria.
- Drive time: 17 minutes.

932
00:52:10,390 --> 00:52:12,859
- And you got home when?
- 11:30.

933
00:52:12,892 --> 00:52:14,928
Precisely, with
12 minutes of previews.

934
00:52:14,928 --> 00:52:16,896
You didn't think
we'd forget the previews?

935
00:52:16,930 --> 00:52:20,033
Detective, if you don't have any further
questions, it is a school night.

936
00:52:20,066 --> 00:52:22,202
Oh right, yes.
Sorry.

937
00:52:22,235 --> 00:52:25,205
No, I think that about wraps it up
for now. Thanks.

938
00:52:25,238 --> 00:52:26,406
For now?

939
00:52:28,308 --> 00:52:30,910
Detective,
we're trying very hard

940
00:52:30,944 --> 00:52:32,812
to put back the pieces
of our lives.

941
00:52:32,846 --> 00:52:35,615
And every time you come by,
you dredge all this up again.

942
00:52:35,649 --> 00:52:37,617
I've already told you
everything that I know.

943
00:52:37,651 --> 00:52:39,886
Sorry, I wish I could be
more definitive... I can't.

944
00:52:39,919 --> 00:52:42,822
Well, I'm telling you that if you do
come back with more questions,

945
00:52:42,856 --> 00:52:45,091
I hope it's because you're
charging us with something.

946
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:49,396
Us?

947
00:53:09,115 --> 00:53:11,117
I can't believe I let you
talk me into this.

948
00:53:15,989 --> 00:53:17,991
I'm sure that was
just routine stuff.

949
00:53:18,024 --> 00:53:20,427
Honey, that was anything but routine,
let me tell you.

950
00:53:21,995 --> 00:53:24,097
Nice use
of the word "us," by the way.

951
00:53:24,130 --> 00:53:26,032
It slipped out, okay?
I'm sorry.

952
00:53:27,434 --> 00:53:29,936
You know, if I had a nickel
for every time I heard that...

953
00:53:29,936 --> 00:53:31,905
Okay.

954
00:53:31,938 --> 00:53:33,740
Just chill out,
all right?

955
00:53:33,773 --> 00:53:36,076
I'm sure this will all
blow over in a few days.

956
00:53:36,109 --> 00:53:39,346
Chill out?
Did you just tell me to chill out?

957
00:53:39,379 --> 00:53:42,048
You realize they could go
for the death penalty, don't you?

958
00:53:42,082 --> 00:53:44,551
He was probably
just trying to spook us.

959
00:53:44,584 --> 00:53:47,420
They only try to spook you
if they really think you did it.

960
00:53:49,456 --> 00:53:51,491
Look, it was
a great plan, okay?

961
00:53:51,524 --> 00:53:54,561
No one can prove that we put those pills
in her mouth because we didn't.

962
00:53:54,594 --> 00:53:56,329
If it's such a great plan,
then why am I

963
00:53:56,363 --> 00:53:59,199
canceling dinners with important clients
to accommodate a detective

964
00:53:59,232 --> 00:54:01,167
who doesn't believe
that it was a suicide, huh?

965
00:54:01,167 --> 00:54:04,237
If you're so
fucking smart!

966
00:54:07,707 --> 00:54:09,209
See you later.

967
00:54:10,810 --> 00:54:12,512
Where are you going?

968
00:54:12,545 --> 00:54:14,381
Out.

969
00:55:59,052 --> 00:56:01,988
A phone call would have
been appreciated at some point.

970
00:56:02,022 --> 00:56:04,291
I was worried about you.

971
00:56:04,324 --> 00:56:08,161
Martin, I'm not sure
you're aware,

972
00:56:08,194 --> 00:56:10,664
but at this point
you can't be my dad and my lover.

973
00:56:10,697 --> 00:56:13,199
I'm not saying that
as your dad.

974
00:56:14,334 --> 00:56:18,238
Before your mother
and I grew apart,

975
00:56:18,271 --> 00:56:20,206
I would be worried
when she was out late.

976
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:22,876
Well, I'm not her,
so I can assure you

977
00:56:22,909 --> 00:56:27,247
you won't find me drunk, passed out in
some greaseball's fuckpad

978
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:30,784
with my panties around my ankles...
unless I choose to.

979
00:56:30,817 --> 00:56:32,852
What the hell
has gotten into you?

980
00:56:32,886 --> 00:56:36,690
I express some concern for you,
and you threaten me?

981
00:56:36,723 --> 00:56:38,792
Mini, when you're
in a relationship,

982
00:56:38,825 --> 00:56:41,494
it's okay to worry
about someone.

983
00:56:41,528 --> 00:56:44,397
Have you ever been
in a relationship, Mini?

984
00:56:49,269 --> 00:56:52,739
My God, you haven't,
have you?

985
00:56:57,777 --> 00:56:59,679
Congratulations,

986
00:56:59,713 --> 00:57:01,514
you're my first.

987
00:57:13,426 --> 00:57:15,095
Good morning.

988
00:57:18,031 --> 00:57:20,300
- This just arrived for you.
- Thank you.

989
00:57:25,772 --> 00:57:27,674
Martin Tannen's office,

990
00:57:27,707 --> 00:57:29,542
how may I help you?

991
00:57:32,579 --> 00:57:34,414
Yes, everything
has been resolved.

992
00:57:34,447 --> 00:57:36,950
Thank you so much
for calling.

993
00:57:40,053 --> 00:57:42,355
- Lois.
- Yes?

994
00:57:42,389 --> 00:57:44,190
We have to reschedule
the Chapman meeting.

995
00:57:46,326 --> 00:57:49,796
I know, just tell them
it's an unavoidable emergency.

996
00:57:56,603 --> 00:57:59,973
Shit shit shit
shit, fuck fuck!

997
00:58:03,376 --> 00:58:05,545
Are you okay?

998
00:58:08,048 --> 00:58:11,584
What do you mean you don't keep records
of who the senders are?

999
00:58:11,618 --> 00:58:13,386
When it's paid cash,
we only keep records

1000
00:58:13,420 --> 00:58:14,754
on packages.
Not envelopes.

1001
00:58:18,658 --> 00:58:20,760
Excuse me.

1002
00:58:20,794 --> 00:58:23,029
- Yeah?
- Mr. Tannen?

1003
00:58:23,063 --> 00:58:25,665
- Uh-huh.
- I just spoke to Mr. Chapman.

1004
00:58:25,699 --> 00:58:29,336
- Uh-huh.
- He... he told me to tell you

1005
00:58:29,369 --> 00:58:32,973
that he is going to be seeking a new
firm to handle his company's needs

1006
00:58:33,006 --> 00:58:35,775
and Mr. Mather
and Mr. Boyd

1007
00:58:35,809 --> 00:58:38,345
have asked to see you
when you return to the office.

1008
00:58:38,378 --> 00:58:40,447
Thank you, Lois.

1009
00:58:56,396 --> 00:58:58,331
What's up, guys?

1010
00:58:58,365 --> 00:58:59,966
Have a seat.

1011
00:59:01,267 --> 00:59:03,503
Do I want
to have a seat?

1012
00:59:05,038 --> 00:59:06,940
We just got
a call from Chapman.

1013
00:59:06,973 --> 00:59:09,709
Well, the old guy
is a little unstable, we all know that.

1014
00:59:09,743 --> 00:59:11,344
"Unstable"?

1015
00:59:11,344 --> 00:59:13,847
He told us you canceled three meetings
on him at the last minute.

1016
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:15,949
Well, Jesus, my wife
just committed suicide,

1017
00:59:15,982 --> 00:59:17,717
so please forgive me
if I've been a little...

1018
00:59:17,751 --> 00:59:19,653
No one's saying this hasn't been
a difficult time for you,

1019
00:59:19,686 --> 00:59:22,589
but whatever's been distracting you,
Martin, started long before that.

1020
00:59:22,622 --> 00:59:25,091
- Chapman was a whale.
- A whale that I brought in.

1021
00:59:25,125 --> 00:59:27,894
- And now you've lost.
- A whale we couldn't afford to lose.

1022
00:59:27,927 --> 00:59:30,096
Clients come and go,
we all know that.

1023
00:59:30,096 --> 00:59:31,798
It's musical chairs,
it always has been.

1024
00:59:31,831 --> 00:59:34,334
I mean, what is the big deal?
I'll land another whale.

1025
00:59:34,367 --> 00:59:36,703
In fact, Jerry Burgess from IBS
just called me this morning.

1026
00:59:36,736 --> 00:59:38,471
He wants me
to play 18 at the Riv.

1027
00:59:38,505 --> 00:59:41,107
I'll spot him three aside and push
a four-footer on the last one.

1028
00:59:41,141 --> 00:59:44,744
He'll be ours by Friday.
Come on, guys!

1029
00:59:44,778 --> 00:59:46,646
We've made
our decision.

1030
00:59:47,781 --> 00:59:49,983
You've made your dec...

1031
00:59:50,016 --> 00:59:52,218
this is my company.

1032
00:59:52,252 --> 00:59:53,987
You came to me.

1033
00:59:54,020 --> 00:59:56,022
I was landing whales
like Chapman

1034
00:59:56,056 --> 00:59:59,559
when you two jerk-offs were playing
beer pong in your frat basement

1035
00:59:59,592 --> 01:00:02,028
and slipping roofies
to the local high school girls!

1036
01:00:02,062 --> 01:00:04,464
I don't give a shit
what decisions you've made!

1037
01:00:04,497 --> 01:00:06,466
This is my firm!

1038
01:00:08,034 --> 01:00:10,170
Look at that smug prick.

1039
01:00:10,203 --> 01:00:13,540
He is fucking with me
and I will not be fucked with!

1040
01:00:13,573 --> 01:00:15,742
What are you gonna do?

1041
01:00:15,775 --> 01:00:18,979
I'm gonna go over there and tell him if
he doesn't back off he's gonna get hurt.

1042
01:00:19,012 --> 01:00:20,947
Are you crazy? We're not
even sure it's him.

1043
01:00:20,981 --> 01:00:22,615
For God's sakes,
the pictures were sent

1044
01:00:22,649 --> 01:00:25,218
from a messenger agency
right in his own building.

1045
01:00:25,251 --> 01:00:27,554
He was the only person
at the resort who knew who we were.

1046
01:00:27,587 --> 01:00:30,824
Okay, but then he could go to the cops
and tell them you threatened him.

1047
01:00:30,857 --> 01:00:32,592
Then they'd really start
investigating us.

1048
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:36,196
That son of a bitch
cost me the firm

1049
01:00:36,229 --> 01:00:38,398
that took me
15 years to build!

1050
01:00:39,499 --> 01:00:41,468
15 years.

1051
01:00:43,436 --> 01:00:45,772
Well, if you go to his house
and you start waving this around,

1052
01:00:45,805 --> 01:00:47,607
it's gonna cost you
a lot more than that.

1053
01:00:53,446 --> 01:00:55,482
Martin didn't sleep
at all that night.

1054
01:00:55,515 --> 01:00:57,550
And made damn well sure
I didn't either.

1055
01:01:12,966 --> 01:01:15,268
- Minerva Drogues.
- Hi, Mr. Rudell.

1056
01:01:15,302 --> 01:01:18,004
- Hi. Mike, please.
- Mike, of course.

1057
01:01:18,038 --> 01:01:20,440
- Can I come in?
- Come on, come on, please.

1058
01:01:20,473 --> 01:01:22,876
- Okay.
- Come on.

1059
01:01:24,411 --> 01:01:26,746
Oh wow, I haven't been here
since you redecorated.

1060
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:28,682
Yeah, I just... I just
got all this finished.

1061
01:01:28,715 --> 01:01:32,152
I'm so sorry that your mother
never got to see it.

1062
01:01:32,185 --> 01:01:34,187
I'm sure she'd approve.

1063
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:37,524
Oh. Hey, if you
don't mind my asking...

1064
01:01:40,327 --> 01:01:43,263
- how are you doing?
- I'm all right.

1065
01:01:43,296 --> 01:01:45,198
- I mean it's been hard.
- Yeah yeah yeah.

1066
01:01:45,231 --> 01:01:47,033
I guess I just keep
telling myself that

1067
01:01:47,067 --> 01:01:49,903
she's probably much happier
where she is now.

1068
01:01:49,936 --> 01:01:52,439
Oh... gosh. You know what?
You're absolutely...

1069
01:01:52,472 --> 01:01:55,108
- Positive?
- No, I was going to say...

1070
01:01:55,141 --> 01:01:57,010
correct.

1071
01:01:57,043 --> 01:01:59,012
Have you seen that show?

1072
01:02:00,013 --> 01:02:02,248
Have I seen that show?

1073
01:02:02,282 --> 01:02:04,951
Stop it!
That's my favorite show,

1074
01:02:04,985 --> 01:02:06,853
- I love that show.
- Don't don't.

1075
01:02:06,886 --> 01:02:08,955
I am not lying to you,
that's my favorite show.

1076
01:02:08,989 --> 01:02:11,524
I love how you never know if the couples
are going to stay together.

1077
01:02:11,558 --> 01:02:14,527
Guh. You know
if you'd ever want to visit the set,

1078
01:02:14,561 --> 01:02:17,497
by the way, or spend the day
or even be a contestant...

1079
01:02:17,530 --> 01:02:19,399
What do you mean,
be a contestant?

1080
01:02:19,432 --> 01:02:21,201
Well, you know,
those date's are totally harmless,

1081
01:02:21,234 --> 01:02:23,803
you spend the evening with a person, we
prep you on what to say before the show,

1082
01:02:23,837 --> 01:02:26,172
- if that would be fun.
- That would be so much fun for me,

1083
01:02:26,206 --> 01:02:27,807
I would love that.

1084
01:02:27,841 --> 01:02:30,477
- Really? Okay. Okay.
- Really. It could be fun.

1085
01:02:30,510 --> 01:02:32,612
- Well, then I'll arrange it.
- You will?

1086
01:02:34,114 --> 01:02:36,149
It's done. Umm...

1087
01:02:36,182 --> 01:02:38,518
- Anyway, have a seat.
- Okay.

1088
01:02:39,686 --> 01:02:43,590
What's...
what's on your mind?

1089
01:02:43,623 --> 01:02:45,225
Tell me.

1090
01:02:45,258 --> 01:02:47,327
You know, I... I know this
might sound somewhat strange,

1091
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:50,930
but have you seen any suspicious-looking
people around my house lately?

1092
01:02:52,599 --> 01:02:54,567
No. Why? What's...

1093
01:02:54,601 --> 01:02:56,536
is everything okay?
Do I have to bust some heads?

1094
01:02:56,569 --> 01:02:58,538
Not today.

1095
01:02:58,571 --> 01:03:00,473
- What's happening?
- No, everything's fine.

1096
01:03:00,507 --> 01:03:02,075
It's just that after
my mom died someone sent

1097
01:03:02,108 --> 01:03:04,844
this really weird picture
of me and Martin together.

1098
01:03:04,878 --> 01:03:07,714
- Together?
- Well, it implied that...

1099
01:03:07,747 --> 01:03:10,850
I know this sounds crazy,
but it implied that we were a couple.

1100
01:03:10,884 --> 01:03:12,552
A couple?

1101
01:03:12,585 --> 01:03:15,322
You and Martin?
Hmm.

1102
01:03:16,589 --> 01:03:18,391
Hmm. Well...

1103
01:03:18,425 --> 01:03:22,128
certainly relations between
older men and younger women

1104
01:03:22,162 --> 01:03:25,765
are, uh... are an accepted
part of society,

1105
01:03:25,799 --> 01:03:27,734
but that must
be creepy, huh,

1106
01:03:27,767 --> 01:03:29,970
getting an anonymous picture?
That is so disturbing.

1107
01:03:30,003 --> 01:03:32,272
- Yeah. Yeah, it was.
- Hey, just out of curiosity,

1108
01:03:32,305 --> 01:03:34,607
what kind of picture
could they have sent you

1109
01:03:34,641 --> 01:03:37,310
to indicate that you
and Martin were a couple?

1110
01:03:37,344 --> 01:03:40,280
Well, it's not like
I was naked or anything.

1111
01:03:40,313 --> 01:03:42,949
I mean, don't get me wrong,
Martin has seen me naked.

1112
01:03:42,983 --> 01:03:44,684
He's my stepfather,
so he's seen me naked...

1113
01:03:44,718 --> 01:03:47,687
- Of course.
...but I wasn't naked in the pictures.

1114
01:03:58,465 --> 01:04:00,467
Okay, sing here, sin...

1115
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:02,736
wow, you're full
of chaos and anarchy

1116
01:04:02,769 --> 01:04:05,105
and... and sheer...
sheer...

1117
01:04:06,906 --> 01:04:08,675
Golly, now listen to this.

1118
01:04:08,708 --> 01:04:10,577
Listen to this.
Sing this.

1119
01:04:17,183 --> 01:04:19,386
I'm amazed the anticipation
of pulling off

1120
01:04:19,419 --> 01:04:20,754
a mother-daughter
double-dip

1121
01:04:20,787 --> 01:04:22,722
didn't give him
a stroke right there.

1122
01:04:24,357 --> 01:04:26,159
Go ahead. Ready?

1123
01:04:28,228 --> 01:04:31,631
- That we want in college.
- She's a ho, man. She's a ho.

1124
01:04:31,665 --> 01:04:34,367
- Mini.
- Yes, Mr. Bishop?

1125
01:04:34,401 --> 01:04:37,070
I've got a note for you to go to
the principal's office right away.

1126
01:04:37,103 --> 01:04:39,272
- Do you?
- Aww.

1127
01:04:39,306 --> 01:04:42,309
- Hold this. I'll make it fast.
- Mm-hmm. Always do.

1128
01:04:44,878 --> 01:04:47,280
- Detective Garson.
- Hello.

1129
01:04:47,314 --> 01:04:49,683
- What's going on?
- Mini, have a seat.

1130
01:05:00,193 --> 01:05:04,264
Mini, this tape was shot a week
before your mother's death.

1131
01:05:08,335 --> 01:05:11,972
And the next day, the school nurse
reported a bottle of Ritalin

1132
01:05:12,005 --> 01:05:13,940
missing from
the medicine cabinet.

1133
01:05:16,676 --> 01:05:19,813
And we lifted
two sets of prints...

1134
01:05:19,846 --> 01:05:22,916
one from the door, one from the inside
of the medicine cabinet...

1135
01:05:22,949 --> 01:05:26,186
and neither one of them
matches the nurse. Okay?

1136
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:28,955
Mini...

1137
01:05:28,989 --> 01:05:32,559
is there something
you'd like to say to Detective Garson?

1138
01:05:34,761 --> 01:05:37,697
Can we see the tape of Der Führer
sucking down her afternoon fix of vodka?

1139
01:05:37,731 --> 01:05:40,266
Or do you guys not keep cameras
in the bathroom stalls?

1140
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:41,968
Don't you dare do that!

1141
01:05:41,968 --> 01:05:44,237
Don't you dare
try to deflect this!

1142
01:05:44,270 --> 01:05:46,573
Stealing, if no one
ever told you,

1143
01:05:46,606 --> 01:05:48,174
is a serious matter!

1144
01:05:48,208 --> 01:05:52,846
Stealing prescription drugs
from a school is a very serious matter!

1145
01:05:56,416 --> 01:05:58,752
You got me, okay?

1146
01:05:58,785 --> 01:06:01,187
- But what was I supposed to do?
- What does that mean?

1147
01:06:01,221 --> 01:06:04,190
- Well, she said if I didn't...
- Who s... who, another student?

1148
01:06:04,224 --> 01:06:06,559
No, my mother.
She made me steal them for her.

1149
01:06:06,593 --> 01:06:09,195
I didn't want to, but she said she was
going to send me to boarding school

1150
01:06:09,229 --> 01:06:11,064
- in Canada if I didn't.
- Canada?

1151
01:06:11,097 --> 01:06:13,066
The Yukon Territories.

1152
01:06:13,099 --> 01:06:15,302
Are you happy now?

1153
01:06:17,137 --> 01:06:19,806
Oh my Lord,
I had no idea.

1154
01:06:21,074 --> 01:06:24,144
- She was...
- What? What, an addict?

1155
01:06:24,177 --> 01:06:26,279
Detective Garson knew.

1156
01:06:28,682 --> 01:06:31,151
My mommy's dead, okay?
Can't we just let her be?

1157
01:06:33,553 --> 01:06:35,355
Detective Garson.

1158
01:06:36,456 --> 01:06:38,425
I assume there won't
be any need

1159
01:06:38,458 --> 01:06:40,927
to press charges
against Ms. Drogues?

1160
01:06:45,498 --> 01:06:48,335
Oh, hey, Mr. Tannen.
I was actually just coming to see you.

1161
01:06:48,368 --> 01:06:49,669
Have you got a minute?

1162
01:06:49,703 --> 01:06:52,472
Detective, I thought I said no more
questions without my lawyer.

1163
01:06:52,505 --> 01:06:55,241
Yeah, um, I think
you'd better call him.

1164
01:06:58,979 --> 01:07:02,916
Yeah, so there's
a small discrepancy

1165
01:07:02,949 --> 01:07:07,454
I couldn't quite figure it out, and I
was hoping maybe you could explain it.

1166
01:07:07,487 --> 01:07:09,689
- I suppose I can try.
- Okay.

1167
01:07:09,723 --> 01:07:12,759
Yeah, we got the final
toxicology report

1168
01:07:12,792 --> 01:07:15,528
and your wife definitely didn't
die from the pills.

1169
01:07:15,562 --> 01:07:17,964
She wasn't conscious
past 9:30,

1170
01:07:17,998 --> 01:07:21,201
but it was the fumes
that killed her.

1171
01:07:21,234 --> 01:07:23,603
Hallelujah.

1172
01:07:23,637 --> 01:07:25,672
- Thanks for the update.
- Martin, Martin, easy.

1173
01:07:25,705 --> 01:07:27,774
- Come on, this is harassment here.
- Just... please.

1174
01:07:27,807 --> 01:07:30,443
Well, see, here's what
I wanted to ask.

1175
01:07:30,477 --> 01:07:33,213
The gas tank in the Jag
was almost completely full,

1176
01:07:33,246 --> 01:07:35,282
only about a gallon
of fuel had been used.

1177
01:07:35,315 --> 01:07:36,750
And?

1178
01:07:36,783 --> 01:07:40,553
Well, if she was
unconscious by 9:30,

1179
01:07:40,587 --> 01:07:43,757
that means that the car would've been
running for at least two hours

1180
01:07:43,790 --> 01:07:45,692
by the time you found her,

1181
01:07:45,725 --> 01:07:48,328
and an unconscious person
can't turn on a car, right?

1182
01:07:48,361 --> 01:07:51,765
Detective, with all due
respect, could you get to the point?

1183
01:07:51,798 --> 01:07:54,034
That's the part where I get kind
of confused, you see.

1184
01:07:54,067 --> 01:07:58,772
In that model Jaguar, if you were
to leave it idling for two hours,

1185
01:07:58,805 --> 01:08:02,309
it would burn at least
four gallons of fuel.

1186
01:08:02,342 --> 01:08:03,944
You see?

1187
01:08:06,046 --> 01:08:09,883
So, it doesn't... it doesn't really seem
like there's any way

1188
01:08:09,916 --> 01:08:13,353
that the gas tank
could be full

1189
01:08:13,386 --> 01:08:15,956
if it had been running
for two hours.

1190
01:08:17,424 --> 01:08:18,992
Right?

1191
01:08:19,025 --> 01:08:21,428
So I guess, you know,

1192
01:08:21,461 --> 01:08:24,164
what I'm asking is,
you know,

1193
01:08:24,197 --> 01:08:26,666
whose idea was
to put her in the car?

1194
01:08:26,700 --> 01:08:28,969
Martin, Martin.
Don't... don't say anything.

1195
01:08:29,002 --> 01:08:30,971
Look, Mr. Tannen.

1196
01:08:31,004 --> 01:08:34,708
I know that you're the person that has
the most to gain from your wife's death.

1197
01:08:34,741 --> 01:08:38,845
But I've also learned
from talking to her friends

1198
01:08:38,878 --> 01:08:41,314
that she and Mini had a pretty
strained relationship.

1199
01:08:41,348 --> 01:08:43,583
Uh, excuse me,
what's your first name again?

1200
01:08:43,617 --> 01:08:46,453
- It's Dwight.
- Listen, Dwight.

1201
01:08:46,486 --> 01:08:48,321
Do I look like the kind of guy who's
going to allow my client

1202
01:08:48,355 --> 01:08:50,290
to sit here and listen to these
questions in these circumstances?

1203
01:08:50,323 --> 01:08:52,826
Don't insult
my intelligence, Dwight.

1204
01:08:52,859 --> 01:08:55,462
- Just cut to the chase.
- Okay, I'd just like for Mr. Tannen

1205
01:08:55,495 --> 01:08:57,530
to know that if he's trying
to be a protective father

1206
01:08:57,564 --> 01:08:59,666
by covering up something
Mini might have done,

1207
01:08:59,699 --> 01:09:02,535
I'd really think twice about it.
I really would.

1208
01:09:02,569 --> 01:09:05,505
'Cause the D.A. In this case,
he's viewing it, you know,

1209
01:09:05,538 --> 01:09:07,507
as kind of an opportunity
to show the public

1210
01:09:07,540 --> 01:09:09,776
that the rich can't get away
with murder in this town.

1211
01:09:19,286 --> 01:09:21,621
Does this mean that he's
offering Mr. Tannen immunity

1212
01:09:21,655 --> 01:09:23,890
if he says he was
protecting his daughter?

1213
01:09:26,259 --> 01:09:28,762
Yeah, that's
a strong possibility.

1214
01:09:28,795 --> 01:09:32,332
But he also wants Mr. Tannen to know
that if he doesn't do it,

1215
01:09:32,365 --> 01:09:34,601
he's going to go
for the maximum sentence.

1216
01:09:34,634 --> 01:09:37,671
No manslaughter,
no plea bargain.

1217
01:09:38,638 --> 01:09:40,307
Nothing.

1218
01:09:40,340 --> 01:09:43,410
It was Colonel Mustard
in the library with the candlestick.

1219
01:09:43,443 --> 01:09:45,679
Ms. Drogues,
as your lawyer, I think...

1220
01:09:45,712 --> 01:09:48,081
Don't wet your pants.
I know when to shut up.

1221
01:09:48,114 --> 01:09:50,383
And swallow.

1222
01:09:50,417 --> 01:09:54,454
Look. The fact that
the marriage was unhappy

1223
01:09:54,487 --> 01:09:56,289
and that there
was no prenup,

1224
01:09:56,323 --> 01:09:58,959
that gives all of the motive
to Martin, okay?

1225
01:09:58,992 --> 01:10:02,729
- So you want me to say it was his idea?
- Well, if it was his idea,

1226
01:10:02,762 --> 01:10:05,732
can you give me one good reason
why you should take the fall?

1227
01:10:11,237 --> 01:10:14,007
So you're saying if I tell
the jury it was his idea,

1228
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:16,309
and I was scared for my life
because he said he'd kill me

1229
01:10:16,343 --> 01:10:18,979
if I ever told anyone,
that I walk?

1230
01:10:22,482 --> 01:10:23,950
Sst!

1231
01:10:27,621 --> 01:10:30,690
Sorry, sport,
but I'll take my chances.

1232
01:10:35,428 --> 01:10:38,398
I never doubted for a moment
you were gonna hold firm,

1233
01:10:38,431 --> 01:10:40,467
not for a second.
I hope you know that.

1234
01:10:41,434 --> 01:10:43,903
- You know that?
- Yeah.

1235
01:10:44,904 --> 01:10:46,573
Good.

1236
01:10:46,606 --> 01:10:49,876
You realize we're going to have to learn
to rely on each other?

1237
01:10:49,909 --> 01:10:52,112
I have only
one concern now.

1238
01:10:52,112 --> 01:10:53,713
What?

1239
01:10:54,714 --> 01:10:56,483
Rudell.

1240
01:10:56,516 --> 01:10:59,986
If a jury finds out we're a couple,
then we both have a motive.

1241
01:11:00,020 --> 01:11:02,689
And that
changes everything.

1242
01:11:04,057 --> 01:11:06,926
Don't worry about him, baby.
He's just jealous.

1243
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:08,528
Even if he did send
that picture,

1244
01:11:08,528 --> 01:11:11,698
what does it prove?
Nothing.

1245
01:11:20,173 --> 01:11:22,943
Oh hey, come and watch.
Come on, you're missing... I'm on TV.

1246
01:11:22,976 --> 01:11:25,545
What? Why?

1247
01:11:25,578 --> 01:11:27,347
Hurry up, the commercial's
almost over.

1248
01:11:27,380 --> 01:11:29,883
Welcome back to "Absolutely Positive."

1249
01:11:29,916 --> 01:11:33,720
Now it's time to hear how the date
between Jason and Mini ended.

1250
01:11:33,753 --> 01:11:36,389
- Jason, you said...
- You went on this...

1251
01:11:36,423 --> 01:11:37,824
Shh! Yeah, I thought
it'd be a gas.

1252
01:11:37,857 --> 01:11:40,660
...to test your ability
to resist temptation?

1253
01:11:42,395 --> 01:11:46,833
Um, well, since Becky and I
have dated since high school,

1254
01:11:46,866 --> 01:11:52,038
and we decided to remain
virgins until marriage,

1255
01:11:52,072 --> 01:11:54,741
I wanted to go
on another date

1256
01:11:54,774 --> 01:11:57,877
with another girl just to...
to see how I would react,

1257
01:11:57,911 --> 01:12:00,847
you know, to see
if there were any doubts

1258
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:02,749
- about my decision.
- Hmm.

1259
01:12:02,782 --> 01:12:04,851
So after dinner,
what happened?

1260
01:12:04,884 --> 01:12:09,956
Um, well, she suggested
this dance club that she knew.

1261
01:12:09,990 --> 01:12:13,360
I'm not really a good dancer,
but I said yes.

1262
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:16,262
- We never go dancing.
- Mini, Jason a good dancer?

1263
01:12:16,296 --> 01:12:18,365
Well, he's a
damn quick learner.

1264
01:12:18,398 --> 01:12:20,367
Not just at dancing.

1265
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:23,470
Oh, you mean there was some other
teacher-student stuff going on?

1266
01:12:23,503 --> 01:12:24,904
No, not really.

1267
01:12:24,938 --> 01:12:26,439
What about when we
went back to your place?

1268
01:12:26,473 --> 01:12:29,109
- You what?
- That's... that's not true.

1269
01:12:29,142 --> 01:12:32,045
- Why are you doing this?
- Why are you being so shy?

1270
01:12:32,078 --> 01:12:33,747
- Jason?
- We turned on some music,

1271
01:12:33,780 --> 01:12:36,616
- we started kissing.
- Shut up!

1272
01:12:36,650 --> 01:12:38,985
But, JJ, you said
it was special.

1273
01:12:39,019 --> 01:12:42,188
You... you slept with her?!

1274
01:12:42,222 --> 01:12:45,025
- No. No!
- To say the least.

1275
01:12:45,058 --> 01:12:48,561
- You slept with him?
- God, Martin, it was a one-time thing.

1276
01:12:48,595 --> 01:12:51,831
Put it this way: You're in for a wild
ride from this bronco.

1277
01:12:51,865 --> 01:12:53,767
He was a virgin,
how could I say no?

1278
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:57,170
It won't happen again, okay?
I promise. He was just a goof.

1279
01:12:57,203 --> 01:12:59,506
Yeah, JJ, tell us more!

1280
01:13:00,573 --> 01:13:03,076
Rudell.
He let you go on there?

1281
01:13:03,109 --> 01:13:05,011
Yeah, I thought
it'd be fun.

1282
01:13:05,045 --> 01:13:07,013
I mean, I wasn't really
supposed to, you know,

1283
01:13:07,047 --> 01:13:08,682
go all the way
with him, but...

1284
01:13:08,715 --> 01:13:10,817
I can't believe you.

1285
01:13:10,850 --> 01:13:13,987
That couple, you've ruined
their relationship.

1286
01:13:14,020 --> 01:13:16,856
The show is called
"Absolutely Positive" for a reason.

1287
01:13:16,890 --> 01:13:19,426
Clearly the only thing
Jason was positive about

1288
01:13:19,459 --> 01:13:21,628
was, uh... yeah.

1289
01:13:23,296 --> 01:13:26,533
You really are a sick
little twist, you know that?

1290
01:13:27,934 --> 01:13:29,869
Well, what does
that make you?

1291
01:13:35,775 --> 01:13:37,711
I need some air.

1292
01:13:40,747 --> 01:13:42,816
By the way, some intern
from your office

1293
01:13:42,849 --> 01:13:44,851
stopped by earlier today
with something.

1294
01:13:44,884 --> 01:13:47,220
It's on the bar.

1295
01:13:56,730 --> 01:13:58,498
What is it?

1296
01:14:03,436 --> 01:14:06,606
I think it's time I had a little chat
with our neighbor.

1297
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:09,342
No, this is exactly
what he wants.

1298
01:14:09,376 --> 01:14:11,011
What if he's working
with Garson?

1299
01:14:11,044 --> 01:14:13,079
Then he can't blackmail me.
I want you to wait here.

1300
01:14:13,113 --> 01:14:15,215
- I'll be right back in a minute.
- Let me go with you.

1301
01:14:15,248 --> 01:14:17,884
- I said wait here.
- Let me just talk to him, okay?

1302
01:14:17,917 --> 01:14:21,655
- He promised me he wouldn't hurt us.
- Oh, he did?

1303
01:14:21,688 --> 01:14:24,157
- When?
- A few days ago.

1304
01:14:24,190 --> 01:14:25,825
- You saw him?
- Yeah,

1305
01:14:25,859 --> 01:14:28,161
I went to try to find out what he knew.
I spent the afternoon with him.

1306
01:14:28,194 --> 01:14:29,729
You spent the afternoon
with him?

1307
01:14:29,763 --> 01:14:31,064
I was doing it for us.

1308
01:14:31,097 --> 01:14:33,366
I figured he wouldn't
turn us in if...

1309
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:34,968
If you what?!

1310
01:14:35,001 --> 01:14:38,305
If I made him think I was interested.

1311
01:14:41,508 --> 01:14:44,644
- Please tell me that you didn't.
- No.

1312
01:14:45,612 --> 01:14:47,380
No.

1313
01:14:47,414 --> 01:14:50,317
I just made him think that I would,
so that he wouldn't turn us in.

1314
01:14:50,350 --> 01:14:52,619
Thank you.

1315
01:14:52,652 --> 01:14:54,654
I appreciate
your restraint.

1316
01:14:54,688 --> 01:14:57,157
You ungrateful
son of a bitch.

1317
01:14:57,190 --> 01:14:59,893
I'd think you'd be a little more
appreciative. I was doing it for us.

1318
01:14:59,926 --> 01:15:02,896
For us? And who were
you doing it for

1319
01:15:02,929 --> 01:15:05,098
when you were doing it
with the kid on that show?!

1320
01:15:05,131 --> 01:15:07,968
Who was that
selfless act for?!

1321
01:15:08,001 --> 01:15:11,371
Oh, like you're such
a martyr for being faithful.

1322
01:15:11,404 --> 01:15:15,275
It shows amazing restraint to limit
yourself to just one stepdaughter.

1323
01:15:17,143 --> 01:15:19,779
Don't lecture me
about infidelity.

1324
01:15:19,813 --> 01:15:22,616
Your mother was cheating
on me within six months

1325
01:15:22,649 --> 01:15:24,417
of the "I do's."

1326
01:15:24,451 --> 01:15:27,554
- If you'll excuse me...
- Okay, look. I'm sorry.

1327
01:15:27,587 --> 01:15:29,456
- Let go of me.
- You're making a mistake,

1328
01:15:29,489 --> 01:15:32,225
- trust me.
- I said let go of me.

1329
01:15:32,258 --> 01:15:34,461
You're hurting me.

1330
01:15:34,494 --> 01:15:37,497
Now you wait here until I get back.
Do you understand?

1331
01:15:38,865 --> 01:15:41,167
Say "Yes, Martin."

1332
01:15:41,167 --> 01:15:42,802
Yes, Martin.

1333
01:15:57,617 --> 01:16:00,287
Martin.
What a surprise.

1334
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:04,024
- How are you?
- I just saw Mini on your show.

1335
01:16:04,057 --> 01:16:06,192
Oh, was...
was tonight the night?

1336
01:16:06,192 --> 01:16:09,062
You know, I auditioned
lots of girls,

1337
01:16:09,095 --> 01:16:13,333
and she was, uh,
fucking incredible.

1338
01:16:13,366 --> 01:16:15,402
Uh-huh.
A real natural, huh?

1339
01:16:15,435 --> 01:16:17,671
Yeah, like a duck
takes to water.

1340
01:16:17,704 --> 01:16:19,806
Totally...

1341
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:21,808
willing to take
direction.

1342
01:16:21,841 --> 01:16:25,078
I wish all the girls
I worked with had her, uh...

1343
01:16:25,111 --> 01:16:27,013
how can I put this?

1344
01:16:28,114 --> 01:16:31,284
...need to please.
- Oh.

1345
01:16:31,318 --> 01:16:33,253
Hi, I need the police
sent right away

1346
01:16:33,286 --> 01:16:35,689
to 25051 Mira Loma Lane.

1347
01:16:40,794 --> 01:16:42,062
No!

1348
01:16:45,198 --> 01:16:47,801
You motherfucker!

1349
01:17:03,817 --> 01:17:05,552
Ow ow ow ow!

1350
01:17:23,069 --> 01:17:25,105
Where are they, huh?

1351
01:17:25,105 --> 01:17:27,440
What are you
talking about?

1352
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:29,542
Don't fuck with me...
the negatives, where are they?

1353
01:17:29,576 --> 01:17:31,111
What?

1354
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:43,690
How do you like that,
you son of a bitch, huh?

1355
01:17:45,692 --> 01:17:47,494
You thought you could
have my wife,

1356
01:17:47,527 --> 01:17:49,229
then my daughter?

1357
01:17:49,262 --> 01:17:50,830
Well, I'm sorry, pal.

1358
01:17:51,831 --> 01:17:53,633
She's mine.

1359
01:17:56,703 --> 01:17:59,472
Okay, you listen to me,
you son of a bitch,

1360
01:17:59,506 --> 01:18:02,342
you give me those negatives
or, so help me God,

1361
01:18:02,375 --> 01:18:04,611
I'm gonna crack
your head open!

1362
01:18:04,644 --> 01:18:06,112
Let him go!

1363
01:18:06,146 --> 01:18:07,814
- Go get the negatives.
- No, this is insane!

1364
01:18:07,847 --> 01:18:09,616
- Stop! No stop!
- I need those negatives.

1365
01:18:09,616 --> 01:18:11,318
You're gonna kill him!
Stop!

1366
01:18:11,351 --> 01:18:13,453
What the hell is wrong with you?
He's gonna tell everybody!

1367
01:18:13,486 --> 01:18:15,055
Freeze!
Sheriff's Department!

1368
01:18:15,088 --> 01:18:17,891
- Drop the club!
- He's crazy. I told him to stop.

1369
01:18:17,924 --> 01:18:19,793
I told him.

1370
01:18:44,150 --> 01:18:47,087
With Rudell having slipped
into a coma after the fight,

1371
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:49,456
and Garson uncovering
my mom's affair with him,

1372
01:18:49,489 --> 01:18:53,560
suddenly that gas-gauge theory
went from circumstantial to airtight.

1373
01:18:53,593 --> 01:18:55,562
Martin realized trying
to pin anything on me

1374
01:18:55,595 --> 01:18:57,330
would probably
get him the chair.

1375
01:18:57,364 --> 01:18:59,633
At his sentencing,
I begged for leniency.

1376
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:15,415
- Hey!
- Hey.

1377
01:19:15,448 --> 01:19:17,951
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- It's okay.

1378
01:19:17,984 --> 01:19:19,986
I forgot to bring
that book you wanted.

1379
01:19:20,020 --> 01:19:21,621
It's all right.
You can mail it to me.

1380
01:19:23,456 --> 01:19:26,626
Are you okay? Have you showered
since you've been in here?

1381
01:19:26,660 --> 01:19:28,228
Uh-huh.

1382
01:19:28,261 --> 01:19:30,964
You know, in here you
gotta be careful when you...

1383
01:19:30,997 --> 01:19:32,332
so how's school?

1384
01:19:32,365 --> 01:19:34,067
Oh my God, you'll never
guess what happened.

1385
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:36,903
- What happened?
- As many of you know,

1386
01:19:36,937 --> 01:19:39,239
the past few months of my life
have been very difficult.

1387
01:19:39,272 --> 01:19:41,975
I don't know how I would've gotten
through it without all of you.

1388
01:19:42,008 --> 01:19:44,878
I really think it's a testament
to the love in this institution

1389
01:19:44,911 --> 01:19:46,446
that I stand before you today

1390
01:19:46,479 --> 01:19:48,748
as the first straight-C student
in school history

1391
01:19:48,782 --> 01:19:50,617
to be voted
valedictorian.

1392
01:19:50,650 --> 01:19:52,819
- But don't you have to be...
- The best student? I know.

1393
01:19:52,852 --> 01:19:56,122
But the students voted and they said
they wanted me to have it

1394
01:19:56,156 --> 01:19:59,092
for..."demonstrating
remarkable courage

1395
01:19:59,125 --> 01:20:00,694
in the face
of unspeakable loss."

1396
01:20:00,727 --> 01:20:02,662
Huh.

1397
01:20:02,696 --> 01:20:05,832
Wow, I wonder how the real
valedictorian must feel about that.

1398
01:20:05,865 --> 01:20:07,500
Again to Marvin Tepperman,

1399
01:20:07,534 --> 01:20:09,169
the real valedictorian,

1400
01:20:09,202 --> 01:20:12,472
he deserved this and I want to wish
him a speedy recovery.

1401
01:20:13,506 --> 01:20:14,674
I spoke
to his doctors today

1402
01:20:14,708 --> 01:20:16,276
and they say
with medication and therapy,

1403
01:20:16,309 --> 01:20:18,345
Marvin should be able
to attend Harvard this fall.

1404
01:20:18,378 --> 01:20:20,447
Did Rudell come out
of his coma yet?

1405
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:22,782
I don't know. Why?

1406
01:20:22,816 --> 01:20:25,485
Why? Because if
he recovers,

1407
01:20:25,518 --> 01:20:27,387
he could blackmail you
with those pictures.

1408
01:20:27,420 --> 01:20:30,023
I wouldn't worry
about that.

1409
01:20:30,056 --> 01:20:32,592
Yeah, but if the DA
got those pictures, he could...

1410
01:20:32,626 --> 01:20:35,395
I'm pretty sure he won't be
doing anything with them.

1411
01:20:35,428 --> 01:20:38,465
I have met some people in here
who can help us with him

1412
01:20:38,498 --> 01:20:40,066
if it comes down
to that.

1413
01:20:40,100 --> 01:20:42,235
- Help us?
- Well, they know people on the outside

1414
01:20:42,269 --> 01:20:45,272
that we could pay to stop him
from taking advantage of you.

1415
01:20:45,305 --> 01:20:47,440
Oh, that's so romantic!

1416
01:20:47,474 --> 01:20:50,510
It's like you're a real-life criminal
with connections and everything,

1417
01:20:50,543 --> 01:20:53,480
but I'm a little surprised
you haven't figured it out yet.

1418
01:20:53,513 --> 01:20:55,248
Figured what out?

1419
01:20:56,583 --> 01:20:59,552
Rudell didn't send
those pictures.

1420
01:21:01,488 --> 01:21:04,624
- You remember Aurelio?
- Aurelio?

1421
01:21:04,658 --> 01:21:07,127
- Our cabana boy from Mexico.
- Uh-huh.

1422
01:21:07,160 --> 01:21:09,129
Yeah, what a sweetie.

1423
01:21:09,162 --> 01:21:10,530
I thought I might
have to fuck him,

1424
01:21:10,563 --> 01:21:12,299
but just giving him
the camera was enough.

1425
01:21:14,968 --> 01:21:16,803
You mean that you...

1426
01:21:16,836 --> 01:21:18,838
While I may not have excelled
in the classroom,

1427
01:21:18,872 --> 01:21:20,607
I think that
my recent experiences

1428
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:22,575
in that bigger schoolhouse
we call life

1429
01:21:22,609 --> 01:21:25,512
has taught me a few lessons that I'd
like to share with my fellow graduates.

1430
01:21:25,545 --> 01:21:28,048
Martin, it was pretty clear
Garson wasn't gonna give up,

1431
01:21:28,081 --> 01:21:31,017
and sooner or later
he'd find enough to charge us.

1432
01:21:31,051 --> 01:21:34,254
It just seemed ridiculous that we'd
both end up suffering.

1433
01:21:34,287 --> 01:21:36,256
How could you
do this to me?!

1434
01:21:36,289 --> 01:21:38,124
Follow your heart
and don't question it

1435
01:21:38,158 --> 01:21:39,726
no matter where
it tells you to go.

1436
01:21:39,759 --> 01:21:42,128
Come on, you would have
done it if you'd thought of it first.

1437
01:21:42,128 --> 01:21:44,664
Why the fuck did you
do this to me?!

1438
01:21:44,698 --> 01:21:47,867
Trust me, it'll open up a world of new
experiences you can't even imagine.

1439
01:21:47,901 --> 01:21:49,803
Hey, listen,
since conjugal visits are

1440
01:21:49,836 --> 01:21:52,105
pretty much
out of the question,

1441
01:21:52,138 --> 01:21:54,808
I was thinking maybe we could try
a little prison phone sex.

1442
01:21:54,841 --> 01:21:57,177
You know, I might even
be able to pop one out right here

1443
01:21:57,210 --> 01:21:59,145
without anyone seeing.
Are you ready?

1444
01:21:59,179 --> 01:22:00,313
- Guard!
- Are you sure?

1445
01:22:00,347 --> 01:22:01,848
I won't be able
to come back for a few weeks.

1446
01:22:01,881 --> 01:22:04,217
Don't forget your family,
your parents.

1447
01:22:04,250 --> 01:22:06,753
- Wait, have you met someone in here?
- Guard!

1448
01:22:06,786 --> 01:22:08,188
Don't forget they're people too,

1449
01:22:08,221 --> 01:22:09,422
and while you may not always
agree with them...

1450
01:22:09,456 --> 01:22:12,592
Why, you old dog! I knew you wouldn't
be single in here for long.

1451
01:22:12,592 --> 01:22:14,261
...remember to love them
when they need love.

1452
01:22:14,294 --> 01:22:16,363
Guard, she did it!
She just admitted it!

1453
01:22:16,396 --> 01:22:17,831
And I mean
really love them.

1454
01:22:17,864 --> 01:22:19,232
Don't just pay them
lip service.

1455
01:22:19,266 --> 01:22:21,501
It was her idea!
It was your fucking idea!

1456
01:22:21,534 --> 01:22:23,870
- Really do it whenever you can.
- Don't let her leave!

1457
01:22:23,903 --> 01:22:26,139
She's guilty! Get the warden!
What the fuck are you...

1458
01:22:26,172 --> 01:22:29,542
- I know I did.
- You little fuckin' whore!

1459
01:22:29,576 --> 01:22:32,112
I'm gonna kill you,
you little fuckin' bitch!

1460
01:22:32,112 --> 01:22:33,780
Get down!

1461
01:22:33,813 --> 01:22:36,549
And I just wish that
my dad could be here today,

1462
01:22:36,583 --> 01:22:38,885
so that after this speech,
I could walk into the audience

1463
01:22:38,918 --> 01:22:41,087
and give him my love right here
in front of all of you.

1464
01:22:41,121 --> 01:22:44,190
Come here!
Motherfucking...

1465
01:22:44,224 --> 01:22:45,792
Thank you
and good luck.

1466
01:22:58,405 --> 01:23:00,740
Hmm, persistent,
isn't he?

1467
01:23:00,774 --> 01:23:04,077
The truth is I wouldn't mind
being cuffed by him,

1468
01:23:04,110 --> 01:23:06,246
and he would be
my first detective.

1469
01:23:17,657 --> 01:23:20,260
Like I promised...
with desire,

1470
01:23:20,293 --> 01:23:24,064
focus and the willingness
to treat any obstacle as an opportunity,

1471
01:23:24,097 --> 01:23:26,533
it's amazing
what you can accomplish.

1472
01:23:26,566 --> 01:23:28,435
And in case
you're feeling guilty

1473
01:23:28,468 --> 01:23:32,606
about having no one
to identify with but me, relax.

1474
01:23:32,639 --> 01:23:34,674
There's a first time
for everything.

1475
01:23:35,674 --> 01:23:45,674
