1
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,297
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

2
00:02:28,569 --> 00:02:33,199
I'm looking for a mechanic.
Anybody here fit that description?

3
00:02:33,407 --> 00:02:36,706
I might be able to help you.
What do you need?

4
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:41,404
I need it fixed right away. I need
someone who knows what they're doing.

5
00:02:41,615 --> 00:02:44,243
I'm not that busy.
So, what's the problem?

6
00:02:44,518 --> 00:02:49,251
I'm not sure. Maybe you ought to
get under the hood and check it out.

7
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:52,588
Yeah, maybe I better.

8
00:03:01,101 --> 00:03:03,092
Looks okay from here.

9
00:03:03,337 --> 00:03:05,965
Great customer service.

10
00:03:07,407 --> 00:03:10,467
Little bit of cleaning,
little bit of paint...

11
00:03:10,677 --> 00:03:13,339
...this place will be ready
for business.

12
00:03:13,547 --> 00:03:16,539
About time for me to play
in the Super Bowl.

13
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,743
Those guys are gonna take you apart.

14
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:25,621
Okay, we're gonna do it this time!
Ready?

15
00:03:27,896 --> 00:03:29,761
- Okay, ready?
- Yeah!

16
00:03:32,934 --> 00:03:34,561
Hike!

17
00:03:39,274 --> 00:03:41,674
To the left. You can do it. Cut back.

18
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,505
Here it comes.

19
00:03:52,954 --> 00:03:54,387
All right!

20
00:03:57,458 --> 00:04:00,859
Okay, suckers walk. Suckers walk.

21
00:04:01,095 --> 00:04:05,361
Hey. Hey, suckers walk.
Go on. Suckers walk. Come on.

22
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,659
Suckers walk!

23
00:04:10,805 --> 00:04:15,242
- Hey, Frankie, what's that mean?
- It means everything's okay.

24
00:04:15,743 --> 00:04:17,938
So how do you think I did?

25
00:04:18,213 --> 00:04:20,773
Pretty good with the sixth graders.

26
00:04:21,049 --> 00:04:24,815
You really know how to make a guy
feel great, you know that?

27
00:04:25,887 --> 00:04:29,414
What's the matter?
We don't look too happy today?

28
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:32,316
I'm missing you already.

29
00:04:32,594 --> 00:04:35,085
Pretty soon you'll be so sick
of seeing me...

30
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:38,629
...you'll pray to have some time
on your own. You know that?

31
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:41,734
- I don't believe you.
- Yeah, believe it.

32
00:04:45,006 --> 00:04:47,338
Now that's Italian.

33
00:04:50,845 --> 00:04:52,608
- I gotta go.
- No. No.

34
00:04:52,847 --> 00:04:55,407
- I gotta go. Yes. Yes.
- No. No.

35
00:04:55,650 --> 00:05:00,587
So I'm not so good against 10-year-olds?
I should try a different sport?

36
00:05:00,788 --> 00:05:01,948
Yeah, golf.

37
00:05:02,156 --> 00:05:03,852
- Golf?
- Yeah.

38
00:05:04,126 --> 00:05:07,755
- Wanna see my swing?
- I'd like to see you in whites.

39
00:05:09,031 --> 00:05:12,125
- Some swing.
- You see me on the golf course?

40
00:05:12,301 --> 00:05:17,364
You're lucky I have a sense of humour.
I would take that personal.

41
00:05:43,332 --> 00:05:44,959
Time to go to work.

42
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,395
- All right, be good.
- Bye.

43
00:05:50,172 --> 00:05:51,867
Wait a minute.

44
00:05:52,141 --> 00:05:54,371
I got something for you.

45
00:05:54,977 --> 00:05:56,808
What's this?

46
00:05:57,012 --> 00:05:59,503
It's supposed to bring you luck.

47
00:06:02,217 --> 00:06:04,310
It's nice.

48
00:06:05,354 --> 00:06:07,413
Thanks.

49
00:06:09,191 --> 00:06:11,284
I could use it.

50
00:06:28,043 --> 00:06:30,603
- How'd it go, Frank? Good furlough?
- The best.

51
00:06:30,846 --> 00:06:33,906
- Did you see that game?
- I have to admit, I missed it.

52
00:06:34,116 --> 00:06:35,743
- It was awesome.
- Was it?

53
00:06:35,951 --> 00:06:39,409
- Yes. You missed a good one.
- I missed a good one?

54
00:06:39,621 --> 00:06:44,456
- I had more fun than you this weekend.
- I bet you did.

55
00:06:46,929 --> 00:06:48,921
Here you go, Roger.

56
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,761
- How's the diesel running, Jimmy?
- Forget it. It stops, it stalls.

57
00:06:54,037 --> 00:06:57,097
- It don't go.
- You got water in the fuel line.

58
00:06:57,273 --> 00:06:59,400
Open your mouth.

59
00:06:59,609 --> 00:07:01,702
- You sure?
- I'd bet time on it.

60
00:07:01,945 --> 00:07:03,572
- Take it off.
- All right.

61
00:07:06,449 --> 00:07:08,747
I'll see you later, Jimmy.

62
00:07:09,352 --> 00:07:13,118
- I'll give you more starch next time.
- Yeah, do that.

63
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:16,587
Say hi to the wife.
How you doing there, man?

64
00:07:16,793 --> 00:07:19,057
Frank! What'd you bring me?

65
00:07:19,229 --> 00:07:21,197
Here you go. Go kill yourself.

66
00:07:21,865 --> 00:07:24,857
- I thought you'd bring me a girl.
- I had one...

67
00:07:25,068 --> 00:07:28,003
...but the guards decided to keep her.

68
00:07:28,238 --> 00:07:31,901
I can't depend on you.
Let me ask you something else.

69
00:07:32,108 --> 00:07:34,474
- Did you go see the garage?
- It's beautiful.

70
00:07:35,512 --> 00:07:39,141
- No garage I ever stuck up was beautiful.
- This one is.

71
00:07:39,382 --> 00:07:43,785
Can I tell you something?
I'm getting out soon. I don't come cheap.

72
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:47,478
But you know I know my way
around cars. You need help, call me.

73
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:51,922
- I fix them, I don't steal them.
- I was framed.

74
00:07:52,829 --> 00:07:54,296
What? I was framed.

75
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:25,355
- What is this, Jimmy?
- I don't know, but it's official.

76
00:08:44,882 --> 00:08:47,009
Crack 210.

77
00:08:49,353 --> 00:08:52,880
- On your feet, Leone.
- What do you want?

78
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:55,718
- Take him.
- What are you doing here?

79
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:59,487
- You're being transferred.
- Transferred where?

80
00:09:03,234 --> 00:09:07,671
- That's not necessary.
- Step back! He's in our custody now.

81
00:09:07,905 --> 00:09:10,339
You got the wrong guy!

82
00:09:19,917 --> 00:09:21,475
Transferred where?

83
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:32,427
Talk to me. Where am I going?

84
00:09:34,999 --> 00:09:38,628
- Get in there now!
- Where am I going?

85
00:09:42,439 --> 00:09:43,701
Hey!

86
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:45,307
Where are we going?

87
00:09:45,609 --> 00:09:48,510
Hey! Talk to me!

88
00:10:33,325 --> 00:10:35,759
Let's go, Leone. Come on!

89
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:38,828
- Get his ass out here!
- Come on, get out!

90
00:10:39,965 --> 00:10:43,423
- Where the hell are we? I wanna know!
- Shut up!

91
00:10:43,802 --> 00:10:47,203
You got the wrong man!
You made a mistake!

92
00:10:49,574 --> 00:10:51,804
There's no mistake.

93
00:10:56,014 --> 00:10:58,778
Welcome to Gateway, Leone.

94
00:10:58,984 --> 00:11:02,112
- Drumgoole?
- That's Warden Drumgoole, convict.

95
00:11:02,354 --> 00:11:04,618
- Captain.
- Move him!

96
00:11:04,823 --> 00:11:05,949
Move your ass!

97
00:11:06,658 --> 00:11:09,183
Let's go. Come on!

98
00:11:11,496 --> 00:11:15,728
You'll be issued one bar of soap,
two rolls of toilet paper per month.

99
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:18,595
Somebody steals...
Turn your ass around!

100
00:11:18,837 --> 00:11:23,831
Somebody steals them, or you lose
them, wipe your ass with your shirt.

101
00:11:24,109 --> 00:11:28,102
You have one uniform.
Your number is 5-1-0. Remember it.

102
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:34,047
This is C-wing. You will eat, shower
and take your yard time with your wing.

103
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:38,187
There's 6 counts a day. Miss one,
you're in the hole. Miss two...

104
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:41,518
...I will put you in the house of pain.

105
00:11:43,228 --> 00:11:44,855
Convict...

106
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:48,825
...two things.
One: I am Meissner.

107
00:11:49,067 --> 00:11:52,264
Two: Never fuck with Meissner.

108
00:11:52,537 --> 00:11:54,664
Inside.

109
00:12:00,913 --> 00:12:04,872
- Sir, what about the cuffs?
- Let him get used to them.

110
00:12:15,728 --> 00:12:18,663
You better watch your back, man!

111
00:12:53,699 --> 00:12:56,190
Come on, guys. Let's go.

112
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:13,709
Nineteen-one.

113
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,595
Nineteen-one! Crack it!

114
00:13:29,235 --> 00:13:32,432
Oh, yeah, you better not
eyeball me, boy.

115
00:13:32,638 --> 00:13:37,234
How were your accommodations last
night? Like your mama used to do you?

116
00:13:38,611 --> 00:13:41,205
- You did his mama, didn't you?
- Twice.

117
00:14:05,972 --> 00:14:07,132
Hey!

118
00:14:07,374 --> 00:14:10,639
Open the door! You hear me?

119
00:14:11,645 --> 00:14:13,636
Hello, Frank.

120
00:14:14,648 --> 00:14:19,381
In the old days, the warden would've
come down that private passageway...

121
00:14:19,586 --> 00:14:24,614
...to this execution chamber to witness
the putting to death of a criminal.

122
00:14:25,192 --> 00:14:30,494
120 men and 4 women were electrocuted
in that chair before it was retired.

123
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:35,667
Beautiful, isn't it? When I came here,
it was falling apart. I restored it...

124
00:14:35,869 --> 00:14:41,102
...put it back into working order to
remind me of how things ought to be.

125
00:14:41,374 --> 00:14:44,434
It's nearly five years since you
escaped from Treadmore.

126
00:14:44,678 --> 00:14:49,012
- Time flies when you're having fun.
- In all my years as warden there...

127
00:14:49,216 --> 00:14:53,619
...you're the only one who escaped.
- So I read in the papers.

128
00:14:53,854 --> 00:14:56,948
Yes, you did.
You and your lawyer saw to it...

129
00:14:57,123 --> 00:15:01,355
...that everything made it
into the papers. The media.

130
00:15:01,528 --> 00:15:05,521
Distorting the facts,
making a criminal into a hero...

131
00:15:05,699 --> 00:15:10,033
...and a warden into a criminal.
You took my future away from me.

132
00:15:10,203 --> 00:15:15,197
You and those politicians. They sent
you to Norwood. That's a country club.

133
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:19,641
I ended up here in Gateway,
the worst shit-hole in the system.

134
00:15:19,813 --> 00:15:22,782
You don't remember, do you?
I asked you.

135
00:15:22,949 --> 00:15:25,941
No, I begged you, Drumgoole.
Do you remember that?

136
00:15:26,119 --> 00:15:30,750
I had two weeks before I was released.
I asked for one hour to visit...

137
00:15:30,925 --> 00:15:34,861
...with that old man before he died.
- I was doing my job.

138
00:15:35,029 --> 00:15:37,554
There's a lot of ways to do your job!

139
00:15:37,732 --> 00:15:41,725
You could've given me an escorted leave,
could've had armed guards.

140
00:15:41,903 --> 00:15:46,101
You broke the law.
You broke the law, and I was punished!

141
00:15:46,507 --> 00:15:51,570
- I got five years. I paid my debt!
- Not to me. But you're going to.

142
00:15:51,979 --> 00:15:54,846
I've only got six months left
on my sentence.

143
00:15:55,016 --> 00:15:58,543
In Gateway,
six months could be a lifetime.

144
00:15:58,753 --> 00:16:02,883
This is hard time. You have no rights
here unless I give them to you.

145
00:16:03,057 --> 00:16:07,187
You feel no pleasure unless
I tell you you can. This is hell...

146
00:16:07,395 --> 00:16:11,024
...and I'm going to give you
the guided tour.

147
00:16:14,268 --> 00:16:19,001
Okay, tough guy. Open your mouth.
Roll your tongue around.

148
00:16:19,173 --> 00:16:21,505
You trying to kiss me, huh?

149
00:16:21,676 --> 00:16:24,008
Let me see your ears.

150
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:35,545
What are you looking at, asshole?

151
00:16:35,723 --> 00:16:37,918
- You check his nose?
- Checked it.

152
00:16:38,092 --> 00:16:39,855
Good.

153
00:16:43,798 --> 00:16:46,824
This is a delousing chamber.
Don't breathe.

154
00:16:47,001 --> 00:16:52,132
X ylon-profic gas can be harmful to
your lungs. Stand with your legs apart...

155
00:16:52,306 --> 00:16:54,570
...arms out and away from your body.

156
00:16:54,942 --> 00:16:59,106
When I tell you, take a deep breath.
Hold it for 30 seconds.

157
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,942
Start now.

158
00:17:21,003 --> 00:17:23,369
Ten seconds.

159
00:17:33,048 --> 00:17:37,280
Not yet. He can take more.

160
00:17:59,741 --> 00:18:01,436
Braden...

161
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:07,310
...you'll learn that inmates are physically
more capable than you could imagine.

162
00:18:07,482 --> 00:18:10,713
If you underestimate them...

163
00:18:10,886 --> 00:18:13,753
...it will cost you dearly.

164
00:19:00,036 --> 00:19:01,970
Watch out for the birds.

165
00:19:02,138 --> 00:19:05,266
- What the hell you doing?
- Sorry.

166
00:19:12,281 --> 00:19:15,341
Yo, Billy, get that weight.

167
00:19:33,603 --> 00:19:37,801
Move it, ace. That's my spot.

168
00:19:53,055 --> 00:19:56,991
That's my spot too.

169
00:19:58,494 --> 00:20:01,930
- Any spot that isn't yours?
- Nope, they're all mine.

170
00:20:02,131 --> 00:20:05,430
You wanna use it, you gotta pay.

171
00:20:08,938 --> 00:20:11,839
Not so fast, ace.
I'm not gonna gouge you.

172
00:20:12,008 --> 00:20:17,207
That little thing around your neck,
that'll buy you a spot for the day.

173
00:20:18,781 --> 00:20:23,150
- Put a fucking hole in your heart.
- All right, break it up! Break it up!

174
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:25,787
I said, break it up! Back off!

175
00:20:25,955 --> 00:20:29,288
Spread 'em. Back off!

176
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:34,157
- All right, Weber, drop the shank.
- There ain't no shank, Braden.

177
00:20:35,631 --> 00:20:37,963
- All right, let's go.
- You motherfucker!

178
00:20:38,367 --> 00:20:42,532
- Spread 'em, goddamn it.
- You're making a big mistake, asshole.

179
00:20:44,575 --> 00:20:49,274
- You go in the hole for carrying that.
- Where's your witness, your evidence?

180
00:20:49,446 --> 00:20:51,346
Well, where is it?

181
00:20:51,515 --> 00:20:53,005
- He saw it.
- He didn't.

182
00:20:53,183 --> 00:20:57,711
- You saw him carrying the shank, right?
- I didn't see nothing.

183
00:20:57,888 --> 00:21:03,190
- You're making a bad mistake, Braden.
- Get him the fuck out of here!

184
00:21:08,999 --> 00:21:13,766
He would have put that shank in you.
What did you cover for him for?

185
00:21:13,937 --> 00:21:16,997
You got your rules, we got ours.

186
00:21:32,456 --> 00:21:37,450
Hey, hey, hey. I do know the face,
and I do know the name.

187
00:21:37,628 --> 00:21:41,155
Hey, Frank. Frank Leone, right?
Name's Dallas.

188
00:21:41,331 --> 00:21:44,596
I was in Treadmore
right before you busted out.

189
00:21:44,768 --> 00:21:48,670
- You were on A-block, weren't you?
- Yeah, I was on A-block.

190
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:51,808
- Good memory.
- Treadmore doesn't have an A-block.

191
00:21:51,975 --> 00:21:57,003
- Watch your feet.
- Okay, dig it.

192
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:00,638
Look, look,
I was there on transfer, man.

193
00:22:00,817 --> 00:22:03,479
Less than two hours,
but I know all about you.

194
00:22:03,654 --> 00:22:09,354
- You're looking at a devoted fan.
- D.T.A.

195
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:14,822
D.T.A., okay. What's that, man?

196
00:22:14,998 --> 00:22:19,628
Don't trust anybody.
Words to survive by. Watch your feet.

197
00:22:20,203 --> 00:22:23,468
- D.T.A.
- D.T.A.

198
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:27,008
You gotta trust somebody.
Let me hip you to the joint.

199
00:22:27,178 --> 00:22:31,615
See this fat tub of shit?
That's Manly. His partner's Wiley.

200
00:22:31,783 --> 00:22:36,049
They're sadistic pigs.
They ain't happy unless they hurt you.

201
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:40,850
I mean, if the warden wants to put
the boot to you, he uses them.

202
00:22:41,025 --> 00:22:45,359
The black dude in the booth
is Captain Meissner.

203
00:22:45,663 --> 00:22:49,030
Now he runs the guards, okay?
He's one bad dude.

204
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,327
We already met. I gotta do my work.

205
00:22:51,502 --> 00:22:56,030
Okay. Okay. Cool. Cool, man.

206
00:22:56,941 --> 00:22:59,171
So listen, Frank...

207
00:22:59,344 --> 00:23:03,405
...when you decide to make your break,
and I know you will...

208
00:23:03,581 --> 00:23:06,948
...you come talk to me.
You come talk to Dallas.

209
00:23:07,118 --> 00:23:10,554
Okay? Anything you want,
anything you need, man...

210
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:14,317
...I can get it. Anything.
All right? Okay?

211
00:23:14,492 --> 00:23:14,559
No way. No damn way!

212
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,187
No way. No damn way!

213
00:23:17,362 --> 00:23:21,423
You're always crying about how you
need a man who knows engines.

214
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:23,226
I brought you the man, Homes.

215
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:27,633
Look, don't "Homes" me.
The only thing you brought is trouble.

216
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:31,275
- Come on, Eclipse.
- I heard all about you, Leone.

217
00:23:31,442 --> 00:23:35,469
Whatever is between you and
Drumgoole ain't coming in here.

218
00:23:35,646 --> 00:23:41,209
The boys ain't got no problem with me.
I ain't got no problem with the boys.

219
00:23:44,622 --> 00:23:47,750
Come on, Eclipse.
You're making me look bad.

220
00:23:47,925 --> 00:23:53,761
- I promised the dude a job. You owe me.
- I don't owe you or nobody nothing.

221
00:23:53,931 --> 00:23:58,766
Hey, you! Get your face out of that
motor! Get your face out of there.

222
00:23:58,936 --> 00:24:03,168
You don't know nothing about motors.
Stay away from it! Okay?

223
00:24:03,374 --> 00:24:06,309
It's been a while since I've seen
an old 265 small block.

224
00:24:06,477 --> 00:24:10,107
That's the last time
you're gonna see one in this shop.

225
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:14,810
Come on. Frank, we can work this out.
We're all gentlemen here.

226
00:24:14,987 --> 00:24:19,720
It's his place. He knows what he
wants. It's okay. Thanks anyway.

227
00:24:23,095 --> 00:24:27,498
Thanks. You made me look beautiful.
I appreciate the endorsement.

228
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:29,634
Hey, Frank. Hold up, man.

229
00:24:30,436 --> 00:24:34,634
You didn't want this job anyway, man.
Greasy fingers, oil on your clothes...

230
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:40,177
- Don't worry. I'll take care of you.
- That's what I'm afraid of.

231
00:24:40,345 --> 00:24:43,837
- All right?
- Prison joke.

232
00:24:44,016 --> 00:24:47,417
I lost my watch. Why don't you give me
a hand looking for it.

233
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:49,952
Roll your ass on out of here, man.

234
00:24:50,122 --> 00:24:54,786
Officer Vazquez, you ought to
put on a few pounds. You look frail.

235
00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:00,796
Frank, I meant what I said. I'm gonna
get you something good, easy, cool.

236
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:06,194
- You're gonna love it.
- Shut up. Get inside. Shut up. Inside!

237
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:14,503
Here's your shit from Norwood, Leone.

238
00:25:18,484 --> 00:25:21,681
All right. Lock in!

239
00:25:33,765 --> 00:25:35,960
Problem?

240
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:40,231
No, I got no problems.

241
00:25:45,244 --> 00:25:47,269
I wanna know what's going on.

242
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:51,347
All I know is that he's in
the general population...

243
00:25:51,517 --> 00:25:56,182
I don't give a damn about the general
population! I wanna know about Frank.

244
00:25:56,356 --> 00:25:59,416
- I'm not leaving...
- Calm down. He's all right.

245
00:25:59,592 --> 00:26:03,722
He was a model prisoner at Norwood.
Why bring him here?

246
00:26:03,897 --> 00:26:06,764
Routine transfer.

247
00:26:15,575 --> 00:26:17,304
- Hey, Frank?
- What?

248
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:19,102
Hey, man.

249
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:24,311
- It's hot in here, man.
- I know. But at least it's easy.

250
00:26:24,517 --> 00:26:28,078
I know, man.
I'm sorry, I didn't do too good.

251
00:26:28,254 --> 00:26:32,384
Walk with me. I gotta show you
something. It's important.

252
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:35,027
- No. Here, you try.
- No. Come on, man.

253
00:26:35,195 --> 00:26:37,925
- You'll like it.
- I'm not into hard labour.

254
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:43,160
- It's cool. It's easy.
- Okay. There. I'm burnt out. Come on.

255
00:26:43,336 --> 00:26:45,827
Come on, you're gonna love this.

256
00:26:46,906 --> 00:26:49,466
Watch the steam, Frank.

257
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,572
I got these off this old trustee.
He did the plumbing here.

258
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:01,914
Everybody thought he was a nut.
Doesn't mean he wasn't smart.

259
00:27:02,589 --> 00:27:05,353
- Come on, hurry up.
- All right, cool.

260
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:10,928
The tunnels under every cellblock,
they lead to the steam plant, okay?

261
00:27:11,097 --> 00:27:14,328
I go out across the steam lines.
Dig this.

262
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:19,494
I shimmy, okay? Across the
steam pipes to the sally port, okay?

263
00:27:19,672 --> 00:27:24,006
Over there, there's trucks coming
and going. I wait for my time...

264
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:29,270
...l'm on a truck that's leaving.
I'm dearly departing Dallas, man. Huh?

265
00:27:30,483 --> 00:27:34,943
You're the doctor. Operate.
I want your professional opinion.

266
00:27:35,121 --> 00:27:39,889
Let's run it backwards. I see these
trucks. They stop running at 9:00.

267
00:27:40,094 --> 00:27:44,997
At 9:00, the tower guards are at full
staff and all the inmates are awake.

268
00:27:45,165 --> 00:27:50,102
Before you go 10 feet, every con in the
joint knows you're gone. And this thing...

269
00:27:50,271 --> 00:27:52,865
...this shimmy?
- Shimmy slide.

270
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:57,136
You're gonna shimmy slide across
200 yards of steam pipe...

271
00:27:57,311 --> 00:27:59,472
...running at 160 degrees
and get away with it?

272
00:27:59,647 --> 00:28:04,812
You try, they'll change your name from
Departing Dallas to Deep-Fried Dallas.

273
00:28:09,256 --> 00:28:12,020
- Just a thought, man.
- The thought that counts.

274
00:28:12,192 --> 00:28:16,390
- I got a plane to catch. Thanks a lot.
- Hey, Dallas?

275
00:28:16,897 --> 00:28:19,161
You got a cigarette?

276
00:28:20,768 --> 00:28:24,135
It's my last one. Here.
Go ahead. Finish that.

277
00:28:24,305 --> 00:28:27,763
It ain't much,
but it's the thought that counts, right?

278
00:28:47,795 --> 00:28:52,664
Last call. Mess hall, last call.
Mess, coming up.

279
00:28:55,436 --> 00:29:00,305
Looks like some delicious garbage
stew. Just like Mom used to make.

280
00:29:00,474 --> 00:29:02,942
That's why I shot her.

281
00:29:03,811 --> 00:29:07,713
- Can I have some gravy, please?
- You want some gravy?

282
00:29:07,881 --> 00:29:11,044
- Here's your gravy.
- You got it all over my food.

283
00:29:11,218 --> 00:29:12,981
- Move!
- What's your problem?

284
00:29:13,187 --> 00:29:16,247
- Nothing. Move it!
- What's that kid's story?

285
00:29:16,423 --> 00:29:18,050
In for murder.

286
00:29:18,225 --> 00:29:21,992
Claims he was just in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

287
00:29:22,197 --> 00:29:27,066
Waiting while his buddy bought beer.
Didn't know the guy was packing heat.

288
00:29:27,235 --> 00:29:31,467
Two guys dead. Kid's doing
the Big Bitch now: Double life.

289
00:29:31,639 --> 00:29:35,200
He'll make parole when he's about 400.

290
00:29:35,377 --> 00:29:40,246
Move it!
What are you, a slow study or what?

291
00:29:40,415 --> 00:29:41,439
Screw that guy.

292
00:29:43,017 --> 00:29:46,509
So I didn't get a chance
to make the reservation...

293
00:29:46,721 --> 00:29:49,815
...so why don't we get a seat
over there.

294
00:29:51,126 --> 00:29:53,253
- What are you doing?
- Taking this.

295
00:29:53,428 --> 00:29:58,331
- Why don't you go take something else?
- I'll throw you through this table.

296
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,968
- Want some cake?
- Are you chumping off on me?

297
00:30:01,136 --> 00:30:02,831
- Not hungry. Want this?
- Who are you?

298
00:30:03,004 --> 00:30:04,437
Nobody. Here.

299
00:30:06,374 --> 00:30:11,812
- I'm on a diet. This spot taken?
- Why don't you stand up to that dirtbag?

300
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:14,881
Shut up.
He just saved you a lot of healing.

301
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:17,515
What's your name?

302
00:30:17,685 --> 00:30:21,280
Why does anybody need a name
in a joint like this?

303
00:30:21,456 --> 00:30:23,481
Helps when you get mail.

304
00:30:24,025 --> 00:30:27,517
Oh, yeah. I need a name?
They call me Killer.

305
00:30:27,695 --> 00:30:32,530
That's original. Did you think that up,
or did someone give you a hand with it?

306
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,863
- I call myself what I want, okay?
- Okay.

307
00:30:36,037 --> 00:30:40,269
Killer, this is Dallas. I'm Frank.
Dallas, what do you think this is here?

308
00:30:40,442 --> 00:30:43,377
- Wanna give me an idea?
- These might be peas.

309
00:30:43,545 --> 00:30:46,480
They might not.
They might be toxic waste.

310
00:30:46,748 --> 00:30:48,716
Who cares? It's all crap.

311
00:30:49,017 --> 00:30:54,819
- Eat vegetables to grow big and strong.
- Stick your vegetables. Nobody asked.

312
00:30:54,989 --> 00:30:58,823
We got 325 other killers in here.
Most, unlike you, live up to it.

313
00:30:58,993 --> 00:31:03,327
Put your leg in the aisle.
Be ready to move.

314
00:31:03,498 --> 00:31:07,196
Hey, nobody tells me
to do nothing, all right?

315
00:31:32,061 --> 00:31:38,000
You always gotta be ready to move first.
You just might make it to first base.

316
00:31:39,435 --> 00:31:43,599
First base.
There's a name for him, huh?

317
00:31:52,481 --> 00:31:54,881
- It's good to be outside.
- It's cold.

318
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:57,985
It's not that bad.
It's good to keep moving.

319
00:31:58,153 --> 00:32:03,284
How come you got this up attitude?
How can you be up in this joint?

320
00:32:03,459 --> 00:32:07,919
It's a mindset. Your body has to
be in here, but your brain doesn't.

321
00:32:08,097 --> 00:32:11,362
As long as you keep moving,
you don't become a piece of this place.

322
00:32:11,534 --> 00:32:13,627
- What's that, like, guru stuff?
- Yeah.

323
00:32:13,802 --> 00:32:17,397
- Maybe I should become a guru.
- You getting sarcastic?

324
00:32:18,274 --> 00:32:20,902
Fucking birds.

325
00:32:22,945 --> 00:32:26,244
Fucking birds don't eat in the rain.

326
00:32:26,415 --> 00:32:32,183
- Yeah, well, they'll come back.
- You save your bread for me tomorrow?

327
00:32:32,388 --> 00:32:35,186
Yeah, sure.
Put that on your list, okay?

328
00:32:35,391 --> 00:32:37,484
Thanks.

329
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:41,152
Why you talking crazy, man?
It's a waste of time.

330
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:44,197
To you, it's a waste.
To him, it's all he's got.

331
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:47,699
That's more than you got.
In here, you gotta respect that.

332
00:32:47,903 --> 00:32:52,705
You don't get much, and what you got,
you gotta protect. You know that?

333
00:32:52,909 --> 00:32:56,436
You don't know nothing yet.
Come on, let's run.

334
00:33:02,786 --> 00:33:04,845
- Come on, Frank.
- Bitch, bitch, bitch.

335
00:33:05,021 --> 00:33:08,980
I'm gonna get wet.
Send you my laundry bills.

336
00:33:18,501 --> 00:33:21,436
Feel something, Leone?

337
00:33:23,239 --> 00:33:26,003
Wanna play? They're a man short.

338
00:33:33,984 --> 00:33:36,851
Hey! I'm talking to you!

339
00:33:38,221 --> 00:33:43,557
Hey, punk! When you gonna paint your
nails and answer to the name "bitch"?

340
00:33:44,361 --> 00:33:50,766
- You got a big mouth. Keep it shut.
- You fucker, I'll tear your ass off!

341
00:33:51,201 --> 00:33:55,865
You wanna play? We'll play.
You talk too much. Let's play.

342
00:33:56,039 --> 00:34:00,976
Goddamn right we'll play. You
and I'll play later, you little fuck.

343
00:34:14,224 --> 00:34:20,220
You want more, Leone? We got more
for you. Come on. Come on.

344
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,891
- Stay down!
- That's a cheap shot!

345
00:34:30,807 --> 00:34:35,302
- What kind of game is this?
- This ain't no game. This is a lesson.

346
00:34:54,832 --> 00:34:56,459
- Got something to say?
- Yeah.

347
00:34:56,634 --> 00:34:58,602
- Say it! Say it!
- First down!

348
00:34:58,769 --> 00:35:03,263
Fuck you. That's your last one!
You're dead, Leone!

349
00:35:03,441 --> 00:35:06,740
You'll never last the fucking game!

350
00:35:21,859 --> 00:35:24,987
Get in there, hit him.
Come on, get in there.

351
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:27,693
Set!

352
00:35:27,865 --> 00:35:32,359
Hut-one. Hut-two. Hut-three.

353
00:35:54,492 --> 00:35:56,983
I'll beat you up, man.

354
00:36:08,839 --> 00:36:10,966
Frank!

355
00:36:24,156 --> 00:36:26,556
Hut-one. Hut-two. Hut-three.

356
00:36:38,136 --> 00:36:43,836
Fuck up! Get over on that other team.
That's who you're playing for anyway.

357
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:52,447
- What took you so long?
- You need the help...

358
00:36:52,651 --> 00:36:55,950
...and I need the exercise.
So call the play.

359
00:36:59,191 --> 00:37:01,284
You're dead, Leone!

360
00:37:14,606 --> 00:37:19,373
- Shit, what hit me?
- F-train, son. F-train.

361
00:37:31,223 --> 00:37:34,215
Don't lay down on me now. Come on.

362
00:37:38,196 --> 00:37:40,790
Come on, Leone.
Come on, you son of a bitch!

363
00:37:40,966 --> 00:37:43,730
All right,
I'm going over tackle on two.

364
00:37:43,902 --> 00:37:45,130
All right, Frank!

365
00:37:45,637 --> 00:37:46,797
Ready.

366
00:37:50,342 --> 00:37:51,639
Set.

367
00:37:51,943 --> 00:37:53,001
You're dead!

368
00:37:53,411 --> 00:37:55,003
Hut-one.

369
00:37:56,615 --> 00:37:57,809
Hut-two.

370
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:04,213
Go, baby!

371
00:38:08,361 --> 00:38:09,419
Come on, Frank!

372
00:38:24,477 --> 00:38:26,502
We did it!

373
00:38:52,204 --> 00:38:54,832
Hey, come on Wiley. Come on, man!

374
00:38:56,909 --> 00:39:01,346
Next time I want, you give.

375
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:16,160
Move it. Out. The game is over.
Let's go. You don't listen, do you?

376
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:21,159
- You okay? Come on. Come on.
- Put him down!

377
00:39:21,334 --> 00:39:26,795
You ain't no doctor. He's on his own.
Get inside.

378
00:39:31,544 --> 00:39:34,206
Real badass, huh?

379
00:39:35,614 --> 00:39:37,707
See you inside, Leone.

380
00:39:38,718 --> 00:39:45,021
Count time, 10 minutes. All inmates
will return to their wings for count.

381
00:39:51,264 --> 00:39:53,232
Let's go, men!

382
00:40:38,578 --> 00:40:40,808
You won't break me.

383
00:41:07,474 --> 00:41:10,136
Still interested in the job?

384
00:41:13,146 --> 00:41:14,340
Yeah, I am.

385
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,527
You sure know your way around
an engine. Who taught you?

386
00:41:37,171 --> 00:41:40,504
This old man named Galleti.

387
00:41:40,675 --> 00:41:43,166
Took me off the street
when I was 14.

388
00:41:43,344 --> 00:41:46,939
Taught me that I could do something
besides hanging out on corners.

389
00:41:47,115 --> 00:41:51,313
- Where is everybody?
- It's quitting time.

390
00:41:51,486 --> 00:41:54,717
- Is that who you broke out for?
- Yeah. I owed him.

391
00:41:54,889 --> 00:41:58,825
Tell me, what put you in the joint
in the first place?

392
00:41:58,993 --> 00:42:03,020
One night these punks broke into the
garage and put a beating on Galleti.

393
00:42:03,197 --> 00:42:06,223
The whole neighbourhood knew about it.
The cops knew.

394
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:11,235
But these punks were connected,
so the cops didn't do anything. I did.

395
00:42:11,405 --> 00:42:13,669
So after all the smoke had cleared...

396
00:42:13,841 --> 00:42:19,245
...these guys were in the hospital, and I
was doing time for aggravated assault.

397
00:42:19,714 --> 00:42:23,616
- Care to join me in a little contraband?
- Why not?

398
00:42:25,553 --> 00:42:28,215
I can see why they call you Eclipse.

399
00:42:28,422 --> 00:42:31,983
- I do block a lot of sun, don't I?
- That you do.

400
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:37,393
I had a guy on the outside that used
to get me good Havanas. Not this crap.

401
00:42:37,565 --> 00:42:40,193
But someday... Someday.

402
00:42:40,368 --> 00:42:42,734
Yeah, someday.

403
00:42:43,437 --> 00:42:46,929
- That's not bad.
- At least they're cheap.

404
00:42:50,011 --> 00:42:53,105
Eclipse, what do you
got hiding back there?

405
00:42:54,115 --> 00:42:55,446
That's my baby.

406
00:42:58,786 --> 00:43:02,916
- Good bodywork.
- Call this here vehicle Maybelline.

407
00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:05,524
- Hello, Maybelline.
- This is my baby.

408
00:43:05,693 --> 00:43:07,217
Nice.

409
00:43:09,764 --> 00:43:12,927
There it is. '65 Ford Mustang V8.

410
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:15,899
Two eighty-nine, with 225 horsepower.

411
00:43:16,071 --> 00:43:19,734
- When did you last turn her over?
- She's been dead for 15 years.

412
00:43:19,908 --> 00:43:25,141
Couple guys tried to get her going
and couldn't. I'm a body man myself.

413
00:43:25,314 --> 00:43:28,306
- Mind if I give it a try?
- It's a dead issue.

414
00:43:30,786 --> 00:43:33,949
Nothing's dead around here
until it's buried.

415
00:43:38,293 --> 00:43:40,921
Save the headstone, man.

416
00:43:41,129 --> 00:43:43,962
Easy, easy...

417
00:46:16,018 --> 00:46:20,580
Eclipse. Nothing's dead till
it's buried. Did I tell you that?

418
00:46:24,627 --> 00:46:26,822
I love it!

419
00:46:28,398 --> 00:46:28,498
- A toast. Let's do the poem, all right?
- What poem?

420
00:46:28,498 --> 00:46:31,990
- A toast. Let's do the poem, all right?
- What poem?

421
00:46:32,735 --> 00:46:35,329
- The poem.
- It's a jailhouse poem.

422
00:46:35,505 --> 00:46:37,996
- Something we all wrote.
- Excuse me.

423
00:46:40,176 --> 00:46:44,170
When we're in a sober mood
We worry, work and think

424
00:46:44,348 --> 00:46:48,341
When we're in a drunken mood
We gamble, play and drink

425
00:46:48,519 --> 00:46:52,649
But when our moods are over
When our time has come to pass

426
00:46:52,823 --> 00:46:57,760
We hope they bury us upside down
So the warden can kiss our ass

427
00:46:57,928 --> 00:46:59,862
- Amen!
- I like that.

428
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:02,897
- You like that, huh?
- It's a little catchy.

429
00:47:05,002 --> 00:47:08,494
This is the best.
I mean, this is good, man.

430
00:47:08,672 --> 00:47:11,470
- What's wrong, man?
- Nothing.

431
00:47:12,776 --> 00:47:17,679
I wouldn't smoke around this, but
it tastes as good as any dollar wine.

432
00:47:17,848 --> 00:47:19,873
Check, please.

433
00:47:20,984 --> 00:47:23,714
Wait.
When my moods are over

434
00:47:23,887 --> 00:47:26,549
And my...
That's not it. Wait a minute.

435
00:47:28,192 --> 00:47:31,423
You married,
or thinking about it, or what?

436
00:47:31,595 --> 00:47:34,996
Are you proposing to me?
You're not my type.

437
00:47:35,165 --> 00:47:37,395
- No, I'm not married.
- Not married?

438
00:47:37,568 --> 00:47:43,666
- Plan to get married when you get out?
- Yeah, that's the plan.

439
00:47:43,841 --> 00:47:48,244
- You know, I had this really nice girl.
- Yeah?

440
00:47:48,412 --> 00:47:51,074
She was nice. And we were in love.

441
00:47:51,548 --> 00:47:54,847
And we started talking
about getting married.

442
00:47:55,018 --> 00:47:59,182
She's got three brothers, like,
about 1 percent retarded, these guys.

443
00:47:59,356 --> 00:48:01,381
They throw a beating on me.

444
00:48:01,825 --> 00:48:04,555
Some guys don't appreciate romance.

445
00:48:04,728 --> 00:48:07,060
Don't take it personal.

446
00:48:07,231 --> 00:48:11,861
She wrote me for a while.
Then it just stopped.

447
00:48:12,035 --> 00:48:17,063
That's when it hit me: I ain't
ever gonna be with a girl again.

448
00:48:17,241 --> 00:48:21,735
I'm gonna end up like Eclipse,
kissing pictures in magazines.

449
00:48:21,912 --> 00:48:24,881
There's so many things I ain't done.

450
00:48:25,048 --> 00:48:28,746
- I ain't never learned how to drive.
- What?

451
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:31,980
I ain't never learned
how to drive a car.

452
00:48:34,926 --> 00:48:39,420
I hope we don't get a speeding ticket.
I'd hate to end up in jail.

453
00:48:39,597 --> 00:48:44,864
Don't be a wise guy. You wanna learn
to drive? This is the best I can do.

454
00:48:45,036 --> 00:48:49,234
Okay. Now cut it sharp.
That's it. All right.

455
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:54,435
Hang a left on 42nd Street. We'll go
to Broadway and check out the action.

456
00:48:54,612 --> 00:48:57,274
Broadway?
We're doing circles in a garage.

457
00:48:57,448 --> 00:49:00,440
Come on, First,
work here with me, okay?

458
00:49:00,618 --> 00:49:03,610
You wanna stay here
or check out the action?

459
00:49:03,788 --> 00:49:06,484
I wanna check out the action,
of course.

460
00:49:07,292 --> 00:49:10,125
- Turn left on 42nd Street.
- I got it.

461
00:49:10,895 --> 00:49:14,456
Look, the place is jumping.
Look at the action here!

462
00:49:14,632 --> 00:49:19,035
Check out those ladies!
Wanna come for a ride in my new car?

463
00:49:19,203 --> 00:49:21,603
- Hey, baby!
- They ain't responding.

464
00:49:21,773 --> 00:49:25,470
They're not your type.
When were you last in Atlantic City?

465
00:49:25,643 --> 00:49:29,135
- I ain't never been there.
- You are now. What do you think?

466
00:49:29,314 --> 00:49:34,149
- I don't know. What does it resemble?
- It's the best. Look at the lights.

467
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:37,482
The Boardwalk
is jumping day and night.

468
00:49:37,722 --> 00:49:41,556
It's hot music. You got high rollers.
You got parties.

469
00:49:41,726 --> 00:49:46,425
You got money. You got gambling.
You got 10,000 chorus girls!

470
00:49:46,598 --> 00:49:50,864
Hey, baby, wanna come for a ride
in my new vehicle?

471
00:49:51,035 --> 00:49:53,003
Man. Yo, that was great, man.

472
00:49:53,171 --> 00:49:57,369
I hate to tell you, your engine just blew
a rod. You're ready for Indianapolis.

473
00:49:57,542 --> 00:49:59,134
You got the touch.

474
00:49:59,310 --> 00:50:01,801
Frank, let me ask you one favour, man.

475
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:04,574
I appreciate the drive
and everything...

476
00:50:04,749 --> 00:50:08,685
...but none of this is real unless I
hear this engine kick over just once.

477
00:50:08,853 --> 00:50:13,154
If I turn the engine on, the guards
will bust in here and grab us...

478
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:16,328
...and throw us in the hole forever.
Forget it.

479
00:50:16,495 --> 00:50:20,363
Come on, Frank. Just for 10 seconds.
It'll last for the rest of my life.

480
00:50:20,532 --> 00:50:23,399
You're such a pain in the ass.

481
00:50:23,569 --> 00:50:29,974
Come on, Frank. Let me just
hear that engine. We built it, man.

482
00:50:32,277 --> 00:50:35,610
All right, go on. Ten seconds.

483
00:50:37,683 --> 00:50:41,175
Yeah! All right, looking good!

484
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:44,783
- Ain't that great?
- It's beautiful, baby.

485
00:50:44,957 --> 00:50:46,720
Hit it, one time!

486
00:50:46,892 --> 00:50:48,792
All right, one more time.

487
00:50:48,994 --> 00:50:51,087
Damn it, Frank.

488
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:55,529
Okay, turn it off.
You got it, you did it. Turn it off.

489
00:50:56,135 --> 00:50:58,501
Hey, kill it, Frank. Come on, man.

490
00:50:58,671 --> 00:51:01,231
Come on, First. Turn it off.

491
00:51:01,407 --> 00:51:05,503
If I turn it off I ain't never
gonna turn it on again, right?

492
00:51:05,678 --> 00:51:07,703
That's right.

493
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:10,940
Please, turn it off, First.

494
00:51:11,116 --> 00:51:13,744
- First!
- Sorry, Frank.

495
00:51:13,919 --> 00:51:14,943
Oh, shit!

496
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:17,645
Frank, turn it off
and get him out of that car.

497
00:51:17,823 --> 00:51:19,450
Get him out!

498
00:51:19,625 --> 00:51:21,456
Frank, get on that kid.

499
00:51:21,627 --> 00:51:23,788
Stop that kid!

500
00:51:27,966 --> 00:51:29,524
Look out!

501
00:51:44,183 --> 00:51:46,174
First! First!

502
00:51:46,351 --> 00:51:49,582
First, turn it off, you crazy bastard!

503
00:51:54,126 --> 00:51:56,287
All right, stop that car now.

504
00:51:56,463 --> 00:52:00,058
I repeat, stop that car now!

505
00:52:04,337 --> 00:52:06,669
They're gonna kill you!

506
00:52:11,578 --> 00:52:14,638
- This is Meissner. Stop firing.
- The warden said...

507
00:52:14,814 --> 00:52:18,306
- Goddamn it, I said stop firing!
- Hold it, hold it.

508
00:52:21,087 --> 00:52:24,523
First, turn it off! Hold it. Hold it.

509
00:52:26,526 --> 00:52:30,360
Look out! Look out, Frank.
Look out, man!

510
00:52:30,530 --> 00:52:34,022
Get out of the car!
They're gonna kill your ass.

511
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:36,498
- Did you see that ride?
- Are you crazy?

512
00:52:36,669 --> 00:52:40,161
- It's beautiful. I can drive.
- It's beautiful...

513
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:44,242
All right. You're one crazy
son of a bitch, you know that?

514
00:52:46,679 --> 00:52:47,703
Move!

515
00:52:50,483 --> 00:52:55,819
- You bought yourself a trip to the hole.
- Leave Frank alone!

516
00:52:57,757 --> 00:53:01,249
Let's go, let's go. Break it up!
Break it up! Let's go.

517
00:53:01,427 --> 00:53:05,329
Let him go. You have the wrong man.

518
00:53:05,765 --> 00:53:07,699
- Take Leone to the hole.
- Back off.

519
00:53:07,867 --> 00:53:10,427
- Six weeks.
- It was my fault, sir!

520
00:53:10,603 --> 00:53:11,729
Save it.

521
00:53:11,905 --> 00:53:14,135
Get off me.

522
00:53:15,441 --> 00:53:17,375
Captain?

523
00:53:17,544 --> 00:53:22,709
I want five inmates. Give me a bat.
I wanna break up this car.

524
00:53:22,882 --> 00:53:25,749
Hold it right there, now!

525
00:53:26,719 --> 00:53:29,882
I want you to watch this, Leone.

526
00:54:38,993 --> 00:54:41,791
Back to the honeymoon suite!

527
00:54:47,434 --> 00:54:49,265
Night.

528
00:54:52,439 --> 00:54:56,034
- You should've been notified...
- Why is he in isolation?

529
00:54:56,243 --> 00:54:58,837
- I don't have that information.
- You don't have it?

530
00:54:59,013 --> 00:55:01,675
Then I wanna see
the goddamn warden!

531
00:55:01,849 --> 00:55:03,282
Not today.

532
00:55:04,385 --> 00:55:07,821
Every hour when the light comes on,
you'll stand, face the camera...

533
00:55:07,988 --> 00:55:10,320
...and state your name and number.

534
00:55:10,491 --> 00:55:12,516
Name and number!

535
00:55:12,693 --> 00:55:14,320
Leone, five-ten.

536
00:55:14,495 --> 00:55:16,463
Face the camera.

537
00:55:16,630 --> 00:55:18,996
Name and number.

538
00:55:20,167 --> 00:55:22,795
Leone, five-ten.

539
00:55:33,715 --> 00:55:36,013
Name and number.

540
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:40,319
Leone, five-ten.

541
00:55:40,488 --> 00:55:41,921
Leone, five-ten.

542
00:55:42,090 --> 00:55:44,718
Leone. Leone. Leone.

543
00:55:47,095 --> 00:55:48,562
Name and number.

544
00:55:53,501 --> 00:55:57,437
Leone, five-ten.

545
00:56:03,545 --> 00:56:05,843
On your feet. Name and number.

546
00:56:07,949 --> 00:56:11,316
Give Mr. Leone half rations
the rest of his time.

547
00:56:11,486 --> 00:56:12,510
Yes, sir.

548
00:56:13,421 --> 00:56:14,513
Name and number!

549
00:56:23,865 --> 00:56:25,594
Get up!

550
00:56:25,767 --> 00:56:27,598
He seems a little sluggish.

551
00:56:28,703 --> 00:56:29,727
Wake him up.

552
00:56:38,613 --> 00:56:40,376
Cold enough?

553
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:55,860
- Wanna see my swing?
- I'd like to see you in whites.

554
00:56:56,798 --> 00:56:59,995
- Some swing.
- You see me on the golf course?

555
00:57:00,168 --> 00:57:02,227
You got a little cruel streak.

556
00:57:05,106 --> 00:57:07,074
Leone, five-ten.

557
00:57:09,245 --> 00:57:12,976
- Upright. Name and number.
- Leone, five-ten.

558
00:57:19,822 --> 00:57:23,485
You'll be praying for some time
on your own. You know that?

559
00:57:23,659 --> 00:57:27,789
- I don't believe that.
- Trust me. I know about these things.

560
00:57:29,098 --> 00:57:31,430
Leone, five-ten.

561
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:33,591
Water.

562
00:57:41,343 --> 00:57:44,005
Leone, five-ten.

563
00:57:45,815 --> 00:57:47,214
Name and number.

564
00:57:47,416 --> 00:57:49,646
Name and number!
Name and number!

565
00:57:49,819 --> 00:57:52,185
Marilyn Monroe.

566
00:57:52,354 --> 00:57:58,224
Thirty-seven, something, thirty-five.

567
00:58:07,803 --> 00:58:10,135
Crack 121.

568
00:58:14,310 --> 00:58:18,940
Listen, I didn't mean it.
No, I didn't say anything at all. No!

569
00:58:31,694 --> 00:58:34,162
That's enough.

570
00:58:49,078 --> 00:58:51,603
- Who ordered this?
- The warden.

571
00:58:52,114 --> 00:58:56,575
Does the warden hate him enough
to kill him? 'Cause that ain't my job.

572
00:58:56,753 --> 00:59:01,087
Mr. Sensitive. He thinks
we're treating Leone too rough.

573
00:59:01,258 --> 00:59:04,386
Forget which are the cops
and which are the cons?

574
00:59:04,561 --> 00:59:06,552
- You want me? Come on!
- Break it up!

575
00:59:06,730 --> 00:59:09,858
Damn it, I said break it up!
Break it up!

576
00:59:15,305 --> 00:59:18,240
Your stick, Mr. Braden.

577
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:24,508
Pussy.

578
00:59:24,681 --> 00:59:28,515
Get out of my sight, before I shine
my boots with your face...

579
00:59:28,685 --> 00:59:32,314
...you fat piece of shit! Go on!

580
00:59:43,633 --> 00:59:45,760
Time's up.

581
01:00:05,922 --> 01:00:08,982
Remember what I told you, Frank.

582
01:00:09,159 --> 01:00:14,461
Roll with the system. Roll with it
or it's only gonna get harder.

583
01:00:17,701 --> 01:00:21,865
Yeah, and it's getting shorter too.

584
01:00:38,889 --> 01:00:41,949
So, what's new, Mr. Braden?

585
01:00:43,661 --> 01:00:48,030
How's the family? Good?

586
01:00:48,199 --> 01:00:50,963
How are the Jets doing?

587
01:00:51,135 --> 01:00:54,195
Don't forget to check your bed.

588
01:01:50,428 --> 01:01:52,089
Hey, Frank.

589
01:01:53,264 --> 01:01:55,459
Somebody die in here?

590
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:59,858
Ain't a very good welcome home, is it?

591
01:02:10,314 --> 01:02:12,680
Hey, big man.

592
01:02:12,850 --> 01:02:18,049
Sand. The whole engine block
is full of it. It was Chink.

593
01:02:18,222 --> 01:02:21,123
What are we gonna do about it?

594
01:02:21,292 --> 01:02:23,557
- Forget it.
- Forget it?

595
01:02:23,729 --> 01:02:28,063
We poured everything we got into this
car. No way we can let Chink slide.

596
01:02:28,233 --> 01:02:31,259
- Let it go, First Base.
- Let it go?!

597
01:02:31,436 --> 01:02:34,462
Aren't you the guy who says
you gotta protect what's yours...

598
01:02:34,639 --> 01:02:38,439
...watch each other's back,
you watch mine, I watch yours?

599
01:02:38,610 --> 01:02:42,944
I guess that was a bunch of jive,
now that you're a short-timer.

600
01:02:43,115 --> 01:02:46,414
You're incredible. What?

601
01:02:46,585 --> 01:02:49,782
You think this is your car?
This ain't your car.

602
01:02:49,955 --> 01:02:54,824
This is the warden's car. Did you
think that Chink Weber did this?

603
01:02:54,993 --> 01:02:58,258
Drumgoole did this.
Come on.

604
01:02:58,430 --> 01:03:02,230
Did you think we were gonna
take our dates out in this car?

605
01:03:02,401 --> 01:03:04,528
Maybe rotate it on weekends.

606
01:03:04,736 --> 01:03:08,763
Ernie, why don't you take it Friday.
Dallas, take it Saturday.

607
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:13,172
And Eclipse, you got it Sunday!
Is that what you thought?

608
01:03:13,345 --> 01:03:17,748
It's his! This lift is his, these
tools are his, the garage is his!

609
01:03:17,916 --> 01:03:21,147
This whole goddamn place is his.

610
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:25,149
And you better remember that,
because once you buy into this...

611
01:03:25,290 --> 01:03:30,751
..."our car," "our thing" concept,
man, you're his too!

612
01:03:38,637 --> 01:03:40,537
Just let it go.

613
01:03:42,507 --> 01:03:46,568
- I thought you were our leader.
- Goddamn it, I'm not your leader!

614
01:03:46,778 --> 01:03:48,211
And this ain't a gang.

615
01:03:48,380 --> 01:03:51,872
We're convicts.
We're prisoners, we're inmates.

616
01:03:52,050 --> 01:03:56,146
We're here. And as long as we're
here, we're gonna stay his.

617
01:03:56,321 --> 01:03:58,789
We're his.

618
01:03:58,957 --> 01:04:01,517
Nothing's ever gonna change that.

619
01:04:01,693 --> 01:04:04,423
You gotta face the facts.

620
01:04:04,596 --> 01:04:08,226
Now, you guys are standup,
no doubt about it.

621
01:04:08,401 --> 01:04:13,498
But I got three weeks to get out of
here. And in three weeks, I'm walking.

622
01:04:13,673 --> 01:04:18,007
Ain't nothing gonna change that.

623
01:04:18,177 --> 01:04:20,543
That's all I care about.

624
01:04:30,523 --> 01:04:34,687
It's nothing for nothing, man.
He's right.

625
01:04:46,239 --> 01:04:51,973
Leone, how do you like my belt buckle,
boy? Yeah, I know. I like it too.

626
01:04:52,144 --> 01:04:55,341
A little souvenir
that reminds me of you.

627
01:04:55,515 --> 01:04:59,849
Tell me, what are you
going to do about it?

628
01:05:02,655 --> 01:05:09,060
You mean six weeks in the hole
killed your guts and your appetite?

629
01:05:11,764 --> 01:05:15,791
It ain't over, you son of a bitch.

630
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:32,379
- Anybody call this spot?
- You guys don't need reservations.

631
01:05:32,552 --> 01:05:37,251
- You on a diet, Frank? Huh, man?
- Cutting back a little bit.

632
01:05:38,190 --> 01:05:41,591
- Take some of my food.
- Here you go. Don't worry about it.

633
01:05:41,761 --> 01:05:42,921
- Bread.
- Thanks.

634
01:05:43,095 --> 01:05:45,996
Some tomatoes.
You'll be all right. Celery stick.

635
01:05:46,165 --> 01:05:47,598
I ain't playing football.

636
01:05:47,767 --> 01:05:52,671
Don't worry about that guy. He's a
lifer. You only got a few weeks to go.

637
01:05:52,839 --> 01:05:54,363
Forget about him.

638
01:05:54,942 --> 01:05:58,002
A miracle just happened.
First Base finally learned something.

639
01:05:58,178 --> 01:06:00,146
I doubt it.

640
01:06:00,614 --> 01:06:03,276
- Okay, who's gonna say grace?
- Grace.

641
01:06:03,450 --> 01:06:05,509
She was terrific, wasn't she?

642
01:06:07,187 --> 01:06:10,987
- I thought I could rely on you, Weber.
- He won't be pushed.

643
01:06:11,158 --> 01:06:14,457
Because you're not pushing
in the right place.

644
01:06:14,628 --> 01:06:17,620
Everyone has a weak spot, Weber.

645
01:06:17,798 --> 01:06:22,565
Find his, or I'll have
to find a new yard boss.

646
01:06:25,739 --> 01:06:29,436
- Welcome to the Gateway Stakes.
- I feel like a steamed vegetable.

647
01:06:29,610 --> 01:06:32,374
- Let's start the race.
- All right. What's your bug's name?

648
01:06:32,546 --> 01:06:35,310
- Dirt Creature.
- Three-to-two on Dirt Creature.

649
01:06:35,482 --> 01:06:37,712
- First Base, what's your bug's name?
- Rear Entry.

650
01:06:37,884 --> 01:06:39,579
Rear Entry's 4-to-5.
Place your bets.

651
01:06:39,753 --> 01:06:44,349
Two'll get you three, five'll get
you four. Five'll get you four.

652
01:06:47,027 --> 01:06:49,257
Everything I got on Dirt Creature.

653
01:06:49,463 --> 01:06:54,025
- I bet the house on Rear Entry.
- The window is closed. All bets are in.

654
01:06:54,201 --> 01:06:56,567
Gentlemen, start your insects.

655
01:06:56,737 --> 01:06:59,171
- On your marks, get set...
- Come on, Dirt.

656
01:06:59,339 --> 01:07:01,432
Boom! They're off.

657
01:07:04,044 --> 01:07:06,535
I've got a steak dinner
on this victory.

658
01:07:06,713 --> 01:07:08,840
Come on, Dirt. Come on.

659
01:07:11,518 --> 01:07:12,712
You can't do that.

660
01:07:12,886 --> 01:07:14,410
We got a steward's inquiry.

661
01:07:14,588 --> 01:07:16,249
You can't push your bug!

662
01:07:16,423 --> 01:07:19,119
It was a come-from-behind
victory by Rear Entry!

663
01:07:19,292 --> 01:07:21,590
- We're gonna rerun the race.
- Hey, no rematch.

664
01:07:21,762 --> 01:07:25,630
- Hey! What are you guys doing?
- Shit.

665
01:07:26,366 --> 01:07:29,858
- Pea! You're on the wrong detail.
- Stand up.

666
01:07:30,037 --> 01:07:32,767
Get you ass up here!
Clean up the gym.

667
01:07:32,939 --> 01:07:35,909
- We got a rematch later, all right?
- Sure.

668
01:07:36,277 --> 01:07:38,905
I'm getting out of here.
I'll pay up later.

669
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:40,377
Now, asshole!

670
01:07:40,948 --> 01:07:44,941
Give me a break. I gotta get
dressed. You know what I mean?

671
01:07:45,119 --> 01:07:47,053
Hey, watch out for my bug.

672
01:07:47,221 --> 01:07:50,418
I'll take care of him
for you, really. Delicious.

673
01:07:51,125 --> 01:07:54,720
- Come on, let's do it today!
- All right.

674
01:08:13,448 --> 01:08:15,780
- Clean this place up.
- It's already cleaned.

675
01:08:15,950 --> 01:08:19,442
- What are you, deaf?
- Shut your mouth and do it.

676
01:10:05,594 --> 01:10:07,585
Come on. One by one, come on!

677
01:10:10,065 --> 01:10:11,896
Come on.

678
01:10:15,270 --> 01:10:17,465
Get him down there.

679
01:10:26,215 --> 01:10:28,046
Pull his head.

680
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:35,321
I told you we'd play later,
you little bitch.

681
01:10:47,069 --> 01:10:49,299
Hey, Leone!

682
01:10:49,471 --> 01:10:52,565
- They got First.
- I can't hear you.

683
01:10:54,910 --> 01:10:59,210
- What did you say?
- They got First Base in the gym.

684
01:10:59,948 --> 01:11:03,783
- What is it?
- They got First Base in the gym.

685
01:11:18,935 --> 01:11:21,028
First!

686
01:11:49,899 --> 01:11:52,026
Twenty years old.

687
01:11:52,335 --> 01:11:58,296
This kid's twenty years old.
I told you.

688
01:11:58,474 --> 01:12:01,966
I know. I know.

689
01:12:10,219 --> 01:12:13,313
You want me, you got me.

690
01:12:15,291 --> 01:12:16,781
You fucking Nazi.

691
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:21,363
You want me, you got me.

692
01:12:53,697 --> 01:12:55,528
Get him. Get him!

693
01:12:55,699 --> 01:13:00,568
- I'll kill you. I'll kill you.
- Come on, fight. Fight!

694
01:13:34,438 --> 01:13:36,633
Kick his ass!

695
01:13:48,952 --> 01:13:50,817
I'll kill you.

696
01:13:52,189 --> 01:13:53,747
Son of a bitch.

697
01:13:54,658 --> 01:13:56,250
I'll kill you.

698
01:14:35,633 --> 01:14:36,964
Do it.

699
01:14:38,069 --> 01:14:39,400
Crush his face!

700
01:14:43,808 --> 01:14:45,207
- Do it!
- Take him out!

701
01:14:45,376 --> 01:14:46,968
Drop it! Drop it!

702
01:15:08,867 --> 01:15:10,198
God.

703
01:15:29,420 --> 01:15:31,115
Linen run!

704
01:15:31,289 --> 01:15:34,884
Get a move on.
I'm trying to make a living here.

705
01:15:36,628 --> 01:15:40,496
Frank, my man. Florence Nightingale.

706
01:15:41,266 --> 01:15:43,894
- How you feeling?
- All right.

707
01:15:44,068 --> 01:15:48,300
- Three weeks and you're out, man.
- Feels like three years.

708
01:15:48,506 --> 01:15:51,998
Come on, man.
Three weeks is a blink.

709
01:15:53,578 --> 01:15:56,138
What'd they do with the kid?

710
01:15:58,883 --> 01:16:02,819
They sent him home, man.
What'd you think? You know.

711
01:16:04,789 --> 01:16:08,589
You know, the kid told me once...

712
01:16:09,561 --> 01:16:15,125
..."Your body has to be in prison, but
your mind can be wherever it wants."

713
01:16:15,768 --> 01:16:17,668
He tell you that?

714
01:16:21,473 --> 01:16:24,408
Listen, I brought you
some toilet paper...

715
01:16:24,577 --> 01:16:28,980
...in case, you know, you want
to write some poetry or something.

716
01:16:30,816 --> 01:16:34,946
Hey, Colonel Klink.
Let me out of here, man.

717
01:16:39,291 --> 01:16:42,124
Frank, man,
it wasn't your fault, okay?

718
01:16:42,494 --> 01:16:44,553
Remember that.

719
01:16:52,705 --> 01:16:57,642
Roberta, have Miss Lowell photographed
for an I.D. For visitation.

720
01:16:57,810 --> 01:17:00,608
I'm reinstating
Mr. Leone's privileges.

721
01:17:00,779 --> 01:17:02,076
Yes, sir.

722
01:17:02,248 --> 01:17:07,276
- I want to make sure Frank's all right.
- He's fine. He's recovering.

723
01:17:07,453 --> 01:17:12,083
In three weeks he'll be out, and you can
look forward to a happy life together.

724
01:17:12,258 --> 01:17:15,625
- Thank you for coming.
- Thank you, warden.

725
01:17:21,300 --> 01:17:23,564
Okay, look into the light.

726
01:17:32,378 --> 01:17:34,369
- Hi, baby.
- Hi.

727
01:17:34,546 --> 01:17:38,243
Hi, come here, you.

728
01:17:38,884 --> 01:17:41,512
- I was so worried.
- You look great.

729
01:17:41,687 --> 01:17:46,386
Thirty-minute visit, Leone. Compliments
of the warden. Don't waste it.

730
01:17:46,558 --> 01:17:49,925
- How do you feel?
- Good, thanks, sweetheart.

731
01:17:50,129 --> 01:17:55,431
Thirty minutes. You need any help,
just give us a call, huh?

732
01:17:59,406 --> 01:18:03,206
- Are they all like that?
- Don't worry. You look great.

733
01:18:03,376 --> 01:18:04,673
You look...

734
01:18:04,844 --> 01:18:08,280
Don't tell me what I look like.
I can't stand it.

735
01:18:08,448 --> 01:18:11,508
I've missed you so much.

736
01:18:19,926 --> 01:18:23,692
No more separations. Promise?

737
01:18:23,897 --> 01:18:26,525
I promise.

738
01:18:43,216 --> 01:18:45,582
- Time's up.
- Nice view.

739
01:18:45,785 --> 01:18:48,447
- What's the matter with you?
- Time's up.

740
01:18:48,621 --> 01:18:51,954
- The warden said half an hour.
- He changed his mind.

741
01:18:53,093 --> 01:18:55,994
What do you mean?
I wanna talk to the warden.

742
01:18:56,196 --> 01:19:00,963
What you wanna do is keep your mouth
shut, fix your clothes and get out.

743
01:19:01,134 --> 01:19:03,728
- Come on.
- Don't touch her.

744
01:19:04,471 --> 01:19:06,769
What did you say?

745
01:19:06,940 --> 01:19:11,775
- Don't touch her? You don't learn, pal.
- Hey, I'm leaving.

746
01:19:16,149 --> 01:19:19,710
Three weeks.
Three weeks. Three weeks.

747
01:19:47,047 --> 01:19:48,878
Leone.

748
01:19:49,350 --> 01:19:51,375
Come here.

749
01:19:57,124 --> 01:19:58,352
Do I know you?

750
01:19:58,559 --> 01:20:02,051
No, you don't know me, Frank,
but I know you.

751
01:20:02,329 --> 01:20:04,763
I was at Treadmore with you.

752
01:20:06,801 --> 01:20:08,894
A-block.

753
01:20:09,637 --> 01:20:13,164
- Treadmore don't have an A-block.
- That's right.

754
01:20:13,340 --> 01:20:17,140
- We got something else in common.
- Yeah, what's that?

755
01:20:17,344 --> 01:20:19,039
We're both getting out soon.

756
01:20:19,313 --> 01:20:23,909
You in a few weeks.
Me, I'm gone the day after tomorrow.

757
01:20:24,652 --> 01:20:26,643
What happened to you?

758
01:20:26,854 --> 01:20:29,652
One beating too many.

759
01:20:29,857 --> 01:20:34,794
I served some hard time in this place.
We both have, am I right?

760
01:20:36,230 --> 01:20:39,495
Yeah, you're right about that.

761
01:20:39,733 --> 01:20:43,931
You need anything when I get out?
Can I get you anything?

762
01:20:44,205 --> 01:20:48,938
- No, I'm all right. Thanks.
- I'm just lucky, I guess.

763
01:20:49,109 --> 01:20:55,070
I got a job lined up. Temporary, but
it pays a grand for two hours of work.

764
01:20:55,316 --> 01:20:58,410
- That's not bad, is it?
- What do you gotta do?

765
01:21:01,956 --> 01:21:06,916
I just gotta rape this bitch. I get an
extra hundred every time she screams.

766
01:21:07,094 --> 01:21:10,723
- I'll kill you for that!
- Payback time, Frank.

767
01:21:10,931 --> 01:21:12,956
- Chink says hello.
- You touch her, you're dead!

768
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:16,096
Hey, bailiff! Guard!
Guard! Somebody!

769
01:21:16,270 --> 01:21:20,570
Manly! Manly! Guard!

770
01:21:21,141 --> 01:21:23,632
- What's your problem?
- I gotta use the phone.

771
01:21:23,811 --> 01:21:28,875
- You know your privileges. No phone.
- That guy is gonna kill my girlfriend.

772
01:21:29,084 --> 01:21:31,484
- What guy?
- The guy that was just here.

773
01:21:31,653 --> 01:21:36,283
- The guy in the wheelchair!
- What are you trying to pull, Leone?

774
01:21:36,458 --> 01:21:39,950
Don't play with me, Manly.
Please, I gotta warn her.

775
01:21:40,128 --> 01:21:44,121
Everybody's got problems, Leone.
Get some sleep.

776
01:21:44,299 --> 01:21:49,293
Goddamn, you fat motherfucker!
Goddamn!

777
01:21:53,909 --> 01:21:58,812
Hey, Frank. Doing some
spring-cleaning, huh, man?

778
01:21:59,414 --> 01:22:02,008
Dallas, come here.

779
01:22:02,250 --> 01:22:04,013
Yeah?

780
01:22:07,022 --> 01:22:10,958
- What is it, man?
- I need some help.

781
01:22:11,126 --> 01:22:13,617
No questions asked.

782
01:22:15,530 --> 01:22:19,296
You're busting out?
You got less than three weeks.

783
01:22:19,467 --> 01:22:20,695
Just help me.

784
01:22:20,936 --> 01:22:24,133
- This is gonna take days.
- I need it tonight.

785
01:22:24,339 --> 01:22:27,831
I can't do that.
Everything is gonna be locked up.

786
01:22:28,009 --> 01:22:31,410
There's a con getting
out of here tomorrow.

787
01:22:31,646 --> 01:22:35,138
- Chink Weber paid him to get Melissa.
- I understand.

788
01:22:35,417 --> 01:22:40,719
I'd love to help, but I can't do
the impossible. You're hurting my arm.

789
01:22:46,561 --> 01:22:49,291
I'll take you with me.

790
01:22:51,366 --> 01:22:53,857
No shit?

791
01:22:54,369 --> 01:22:57,031
- What's the plan?
- You'll know when you gotta know.

792
01:22:58,940 --> 01:23:02,307
Going for the tunnels, huh, man?

793
01:23:02,510 --> 01:23:04,842
You just be here, all right?

794
01:23:06,014 --> 01:23:08,380
Convict, move it out of there!

795
01:23:08,550 --> 01:23:13,386
Hey, use some bleach on that, Frank.
I'm coming out, Colonel Klink.

796
01:23:17,526 --> 01:23:18,754
Linen run.

797
01:23:18,928 --> 01:23:22,261
- Evening, Officer Vazquez.
- You're late. Get in there.

798
01:23:22,498 --> 01:23:23,726
- Yes, sir.
- Quick.

799
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:27,060
- I'll be real quick.
- Still making that jailhouse booze?

800
01:23:27,336 --> 01:23:31,670
Absolutely not, sir. I'm on the wagon.
I joined Alcoholics Unanimous.

801
01:23:31,907 --> 01:23:34,774
- You got some line of shit.
- It's bad on my nervous system.

802
01:23:35,011 --> 01:23:37,673
- Makes me talk too much.
- Just make it quick.

803
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:41,213
Yeah, I'll be right out, sir.
Right out.

804
01:23:48,758 --> 01:23:51,226
No. Help! Oh, shit!

805
01:23:53,596 --> 01:23:55,587
Help me!

806
01:23:57,700 --> 01:23:59,395
Come on, Frank. Let's go.

807
01:23:59,635 --> 01:24:01,865
Okay, come on. That's it.

808
01:24:05,241 --> 01:24:08,574
- All right, we got 10 minutes. Move it.
- All right.

809
01:24:08,811 --> 01:24:10,711
Sweet dreams, Moby Dick.

810
01:24:11,447 --> 01:24:12,937
- Frank?
- Come on.

811
01:24:13,215 --> 01:24:15,012
The tools, man.

812
01:24:29,065 --> 01:24:30,430
You got it.

813
01:24:32,601 --> 01:24:35,035
Okay, here I go.

814
01:24:35,938 --> 01:24:38,133
Oh, God. I'm jumping.

815
01:24:41,077 --> 01:24:43,602
Man, there's rats in here.

816
01:24:54,924 --> 01:24:57,416
- All right. I'm all right. No!
- What?

817
01:24:57,594 --> 01:25:00,859
- This way. It's a shortcut to the plant.
- It's this way.

818
01:25:01,064 --> 01:25:06,297
No, man, I remember the map.
It's this way. I'm positive. Let's go!

819
01:25:24,321 --> 01:25:26,016
D.T.A., Frank.

820
01:25:28,024 --> 01:25:31,357
Ain't that what you taught me, man?
D.T.A.

821
01:25:31,528 --> 01:25:34,019
Right on schedule, Frank.

822
01:25:34,231 --> 01:25:36,825
I'm sorry, man.
You were my ticket out of here.

823
01:25:37,400 --> 01:25:39,391
Damn you!

824
01:25:43,240 --> 01:25:47,643
You had me set up the whole time?!

825
01:25:47,844 --> 01:25:52,907
Not the whole time. I got
30 years to go, man. Thirty years.

826
01:25:53,884 --> 01:25:56,546
The warden made me a deal.

827
01:25:57,888 --> 01:25:59,913
Dumb bastard!

828
01:26:00,157 --> 01:26:02,182
They made me a deal, man!
A deal!

829
01:26:02,392 --> 01:26:05,691
We don't make deals
with escaping prisoners.

830
01:26:08,665 --> 01:26:11,190
What the hell are you talking about?

831
01:26:11,434 --> 01:26:13,902
- You said if I delivered...
- Shut up.

832
01:26:14,171 --> 01:26:17,663
- You're going back to the population.
- Population?

833
01:26:17,874 --> 01:26:21,207
You can't do this to me, warden.
You can't do this.

834
01:26:21,444 --> 01:26:24,538
I snitched him off.
They're gonna kill me. I'm finished.

835
01:26:24,714 --> 01:26:26,579
Tough.

836
01:26:26,950 --> 01:26:30,750
Look, I came through, goddamn it!
We had a deal!

837
01:26:33,089 --> 01:26:35,751
That's enough.
You're gonna kill him.

838
01:26:37,294 --> 01:26:38,488
That's enough.

839
01:26:45,036 --> 01:26:47,869
This is an automatic 10 years, Frank.

840
01:26:48,072 --> 01:26:51,530
It's 10 years for a second
escape attempt.

841
01:26:51,709 --> 01:26:55,372
I knew you'd cross the line. I told
them you were a hard-core criminal.

842
01:26:55,580 --> 01:26:59,778
They'll believe me now.
And you better believe me.

843
01:26:59,984 --> 01:27:03,545
You better believe that you'll
be doing hard time here...

844
01:27:03,788 --> 01:27:06,222
...for the rest of your life.

845
01:27:07,558 --> 01:27:09,753
Manly, you know what to do.

846
01:27:22,974 --> 01:27:24,965
Some dealmaker.

847
01:27:33,951 --> 01:27:35,213
See...

848
01:27:35,486 --> 01:27:37,954
...shit does float, doesn't it?

849
01:27:38,222 --> 01:27:40,053
Hey, you know what else?

850
01:27:40,224 --> 01:27:44,422
You don't have to worry about
that psycho hurting your girlfriend.

851
01:27:44,662 --> 01:27:48,098
We decided to keep him in here.
Didn't we, officer?

852
01:27:55,940 --> 01:27:57,908
She's not my type.

853
01:28:01,746 --> 01:28:01,846
We'll teach him a lesson.
We'll graduate you with honours.

854
01:28:01,846 --> 01:28:04,644
We'll teach him a lesson.
We'll graduate you with honours.

855
01:28:04,882 --> 01:28:09,251
Turn on the steam.
Turn on the fucking steam!

856
01:28:09,453 --> 01:28:11,045
Put him in it.

857
01:28:11,355 --> 01:28:13,152
Get him in there.

858
01:28:19,130 --> 01:28:21,894
Bring him in here! Come on!

859
01:28:27,673 --> 01:28:29,641
Come on!

860
01:28:38,283 --> 01:28:40,274
Rape this.

861
01:28:42,821 --> 01:28:47,690
My face! My face is burning!
My face!

862
01:29:03,308 --> 01:29:05,071
I'll kill you!

863
01:29:30,836 --> 01:29:32,827
School's out, punk.

864
01:30:31,497 --> 01:30:33,089
Frank.

865
01:30:35,134 --> 01:30:37,762
Frank, don't leave me here, man.

866
01:30:46,112 --> 01:30:47,909
I'm sorry.

867
01:30:48,614 --> 01:30:50,605
Take me with you.

868
01:31:11,137 --> 01:31:13,367
Let him go, Manly.

869
01:31:13,639 --> 01:31:15,436
Let him go.

870
01:31:23,749 --> 01:31:25,876
What are you gonna do with that?

871
01:31:26,152 --> 01:31:27,813
You okay, Frank?

872
01:31:28,387 --> 01:31:30,218
I'm okay, Dallas.

873
01:31:31,090 --> 01:31:34,218
You can trust me, Frank.
You can trust me.

874
01:31:34,494 --> 01:31:37,554
- Put it down, Dallas.
- Put it down.

875
01:31:37,830 --> 01:31:41,493
- I won't hurt you anymore.
- Oh, yeah?

876
01:31:43,603 --> 01:31:47,471
- You don't wanna do it.
- You fat piece of shit.

877
01:31:47,640 --> 01:31:49,005
Don't do it, Dallas.

878
01:31:49,609 --> 01:31:53,171
- What, are you trying to scare me?
- Dallas, don't.

879
01:31:54,882 --> 01:31:57,749
- You won't do it.
- Oh, yeah?

880
01:31:58,051 --> 01:32:02,112
- You don't got the balls to do it, punk.
- You're wrong.

881
01:32:02,289 --> 01:32:04,757
- Stoolie.
- You're wrong.

882
01:32:05,692 --> 01:32:07,751
- Put it down.
- You're wrong!

883
01:32:08,028 --> 01:32:09,427
No!

884
01:32:27,781 --> 01:32:31,649
Switch to backup. Sir, we've got
a power outage in C-wing.

885
01:32:32,386 --> 01:32:34,820
Get some men to that utility quarter.

886
01:32:58,545 --> 01:33:02,675
You better have a good reason for not
telling me you knew Leone was escaping.

887
01:33:02,849 --> 01:33:05,579
I've got a dead officer and
a dead inmate.

888
01:33:05,819 --> 01:33:08,014
And I don't have any answers.
Do you?

889
01:33:08,188 --> 01:33:11,715
I was trying to save an informant's
life by keeping it secret.

890
01:33:11,892 --> 01:33:16,352
Why would a man who's got
three weeks to go try to break out?

891
01:33:16,663 --> 01:33:19,257
We can ask him
when we catch him.

892
01:33:39,320 --> 01:33:43,381
Busted cable, utility corridor.
He's going to the roof.

893
01:35:14,682 --> 01:35:16,707
Bring up zone two.

894
01:35:17,552 --> 01:35:19,452
Can't you get any more light in there?

895
01:35:19,620 --> 01:35:21,020
Captain Meissner.

896
01:35:21,190 --> 01:35:23,385
This is Osner.
I'm in the well room.

897
01:35:23,525 --> 01:35:25,686
Looks like this is where he went out.

898
01:35:36,505 --> 01:35:39,633
Sir, that has got to be at least
200 yards underwater.

899
01:35:39,842 --> 01:35:42,970
- Do you really think he made it?
- Maybe not, Mr. Braden.

900
01:35:43,245 --> 01:35:45,770
But until you bring me a body,
I've got an escaped prisoner.

901
01:35:45,948 --> 01:35:48,940
- This is Drumgoole. I want sector four.
- Meissner, sector four.

902
01:35:49,118 --> 01:35:52,349
- What do you have?
- Right now, nothing, sir.

903
01:35:52,588 --> 01:35:55,955
I'm thinking of calling in the
local and state police.

904
01:35:56,225 --> 01:36:00,924
No! No outside agencies.
I repeat, no outside agencies.

905
01:36:01,130 --> 01:36:04,725
This is an internal matter.
He's alive, I want him.

906
01:36:04,967 --> 01:36:09,063
- Arm a tactical squad and meet me.
- Yes, sir.

907
01:36:09,972 --> 01:36:14,033
Mr. Braden, you will

908
01:36:36,665 --> 01:36:39,065
You won't get away with it.

909
01:36:40,569 --> 01:36:42,400
You know that, don't you?

910
01:36:43,772 --> 01:36:45,967
I could've got out.

911
01:36:47,910 --> 01:36:51,209
But I'm not going to spend my life...

912
01:36:51,480 --> 01:36:55,075
...running from you.

913
01:36:59,421 --> 01:37:01,389
Paul, look at this.

914
01:37:04,593 --> 01:37:06,221
Get your ass inside.

915
01:37:06,496 --> 01:37:08,487
Whoa, hold it.

916
01:37:09,199 --> 01:37:12,293
- You can't use me as a hostage...
- Shut up! Shut up!

917
01:37:12,535 --> 01:37:15,402
You recognize that chair?

918
01:37:15,672 --> 01:37:19,938
You built it, didn't you?
Now get in there. Get in there!

919
01:37:20,176 --> 01:37:22,440
Don't even think about moving.

920
01:37:25,448 --> 01:37:29,748
You think you're gonna take me
to hell, huh? I'll show you hell!

921
01:37:31,421 --> 01:37:33,912
All right, over there.

922
01:37:34,424 --> 01:37:36,221
Move your leg!

923
01:37:36,526 --> 01:37:40,826
Dallas, he fried,
the way you're gonna fry.

924
01:37:42,265 --> 01:37:47,464
First Base, you took him downstairs,
you broke his goddamn neck!

925
01:37:50,039 --> 01:37:55,033
I'm gonna fry your brains.
What do you know? It's a perfect fit.

926
01:37:55,912 --> 01:37:57,903
Move! Move!

927
01:37:59,382 --> 01:38:03,819
You can't make this work.
You're not smart enough. You're stupid.

928
01:38:03,987 --> 01:38:05,420
You're scum.

929
01:38:05,588 --> 01:38:08,557
Shut up! I'll show you scum.

930
01:38:09,792 --> 01:38:13,558
You can't kill a man. You're not
a murderer. You don't have the guts.

931
01:38:19,469 --> 01:38:22,302
Ten more years.
Isn't that what you said?

932
01:38:23,239 --> 01:38:25,002
How about 20?

933
01:38:25,475 --> 01:38:26,908
How about 30?

934
01:38:27,176 --> 01:38:31,670
No, it doesn't matter what they give
me because you won't be satisfied...

935
01:38:31,948 --> 01:38:33,313
...till you got me for life.

936
01:38:33,483 --> 01:38:35,474
Make a hole.

937
01:38:35,752 --> 01:38:37,310
Take it down!

938
01:38:39,689 --> 01:38:41,884
I ain't doing life for nothing.

939
01:38:43,159 --> 01:38:45,389
Come on. Lean on it, man!

940
01:38:45,595 --> 01:38:48,428
They're gonna break that door down.

941
01:38:48,665 --> 01:38:51,533
And they're going to take
your skull apart!

942
01:38:51,702 --> 01:38:54,762
You're going to beg me
to let them kill you.

943
01:38:55,139 --> 01:38:57,539
- Come on, break it down!
- Meissner!

944
01:38:59,043 --> 01:39:01,102
Harder, man. Harder!

945
01:39:05,149 --> 01:39:07,344
Come on, lean on it.

946
01:39:07,851 --> 01:39:09,443
No!

947
01:39:11,288 --> 01:39:12,846
No!

948
01:39:14,959 --> 01:39:16,517
Take out the glass!

949
01:39:19,730 --> 01:39:21,789
Shoot! Shoot me!

950
01:39:21,966 --> 01:39:23,433
- Don't shoot!
- Shoot!

951
01:39:23,634 --> 01:39:26,068
He has his hand taped to the lever.

952
01:39:26,537 --> 01:39:28,004
No!

953
01:39:28,505 --> 01:39:32,532
- Don't shoot!
- Hold your fire. Hold your fire.

954
01:39:32,710 --> 01:39:34,041
Come on, shoot!

955
01:39:36,480 --> 01:39:38,038
Hold your fire!

956
01:39:41,018 --> 01:39:43,646
Relax. Just relax.

957
01:39:44,488 --> 01:39:47,889
Glad you're here, Meissner. This
wouldn't be official without witnesses.

958
01:39:48,058 --> 01:39:53,052
He's bluffing. He's wants me to take
responsibility for his escape attempt.

959
01:39:53,330 --> 01:39:57,061
I don't want a confession.
You set me up. You set everything up!

960
01:39:57,234 --> 01:40:01,568
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- I'm talking about Chink Weber!

961
01:40:01,772 --> 01:40:03,467
The goons.

962
01:40:03,907 --> 01:40:06,774
The cop that was gonna rape Melissa.

963
01:40:07,578 --> 01:40:08,875
Dallas.

964
01:40:09,847 --> 01:40:12,213
The killing of the kid.

965
01:40:13,350 --> 01:40:15,341
Guilty on all counts.

966
01:40:15,519 --> 01:40:20,684
Prove it! That's your problem.
You can't prove anything.

967
01:40:20,858 --> 01:40:25,420
I don't have to prove nothing.
I came here for an execution.

968
01:40:25,596 --> 01:40:28,895
I demand to be released from here!

969
01:40:29,933 --> 01:40:31,366
No!

970
01:40:31,535 --> 01:40:35,996
Don't do it, Leone. Don't do it.
Take it easy.

971
01:40:36,708 --> 01:40:40,007
You deserve payback.

972
01:40:40,211 --> 01:40:41,610
Frank!

973
01:40:43,782 --> 01:40:45,773
Please, Frank.

974
01:40:47,052 --> 01:40:50,783
Don't kill me. It's true.

975
01:40:53,792 --> 01:40:57,284
I confess, Mr. Meissner.

976
01:40:57,562 --> 01:41:00,429
Everything that he said was true.

977
01:41:00,665 --> 01:41:03,532
I set him up. Everything.

978
01:41:07,272 --> 01:41:08,739
Please.

979
01:41:10,075 --> 01:41:12,270
Don't kill me.

980
01:41:13,778 --> 01:41:14,972
Don't...

981
01:41:15,680 --> 01:41:21,118
See you in hell, Drumgoole.

982
01:41:38,002 --> 01:41:40,436
Works better with this.

983
01:41:42,373 --> 01:41:44,739
Take him to the hole, Mr. Meissner.

984
01:41:45,110 --> 01:41:49,206
Mr. Braden, take the prisoner
to the hole.

985
01:41:49,481 --> 01:41:51,312
- Cuff him.
- Yes, sir.

986
01:41:51,583 --> 01:41:55,849
Somebody get me
out of this chair.

987
01:41:57,355 --> 01:41:58,788
Come on.

988
01:42:03,228 --> 01:42:07,824
Thank you, Mr. Meissner.
I said take him to the hole.

989
01:42:07,999 --> 01:42:09,830
I can't do that.

990
01:42:10,535 --> 01:42:12,332
Take the warden into custody.

991
01:42:12,537 --> 01:42:15,631
- I said take him. What are you doing?
- Cuff him.

992
01:42:15,907 --> 01:42:21,312
Stop it! I am warden of this institution,
and you will obey... Stop that!

993
01:42:21,747 --> 01:42:27,014
That was just a stupid confession to
try and save my life. Are you crazy?

994
01:42:27,419 --> 01:42:29,649
No, but you are.

995
01:42:29,922 --> 01:42:35,053
Until this matter's resolved in a judicial
inquiry, you'll remain in our custody.

996
01:42:37,396 --> 01:42:40,058
I'll have your ass for this.

997
01:42:40,332 --> 01:42:43,824
I'll have your ass.

998
01:42:44,870 --> 01:42:46,531
Move him!

999
01:42:57,950 --> 01:43:00,578
I only wanted to do my time, captain.

1000
01:43:01,020 --> 01:43:03,511
You'll get your chance.

1001
01:43:03,689 --> 01:43:05,782
Move him.

1002
01:43:25,611 --> 01:43:27,704
Hey, Ernie.

1003
01:43:27,880 --> 01:43:29,745
Hang in there, Frank.

1004
01:43:30,115 --> 01:43:31,605
Hey, Frank?

1005
01:43:31,784 --> 01:43:33,775
- Eclipse.
- Take care.

1006
01:43:33,953 --> 01:43:36,581
You too. Thanks a lot, big man.

1007
01:43:36,755 --> 01:43:39,952
Yeah. That okay?

1008
01:43:40,125 --> 01:43:41,888
It's all right.

1009
01:43:44,263 --> 01:43:49,064
Got this one from
Fidel Castro himself.

1010
01:43:51,270 --> 01:43:53,932
- See you, big man.
- Okay.

1011
01:44:13,960 --> 01:44:15,860
Hold it.

1012
01:44:16,162 --> 01:44:18,995
Crack the outside!

1013
01:44:19,866 --> 01:44:23,734
- Know what I'll miss most about you?
- What's that?

1014
01:44:24,604 --> 01:44:27,368
Your incredible smile.

1015
01:44:38,752 --> 01:44:42,620
- Take care of yourself, Leone.
- Thanks, captain.

1016
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:55,160
Lock 'em!

1017
01:44:56,160 --> 01:45:06,160
