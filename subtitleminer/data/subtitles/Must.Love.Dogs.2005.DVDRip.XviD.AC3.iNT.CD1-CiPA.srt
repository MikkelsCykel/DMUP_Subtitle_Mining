00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,120
The best place to meet a guy
is the supermarket,

2
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,960
You see a guy holding a list,
you know he's married,

3
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:08,360
He's in the frozen-food section
carrying a small basket, he's single,

4
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,520
l hang out by fruits and vegetables,
Better chance of getting a guy who's healthy,

5
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,200
Probably the best place
is Home Depot or any hardware store,

6
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,040
You just walk up
to the cutest guy and say:

7
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,920
''Do you know where l can get nailed?
l mean, nails?

8
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,720
Pardon me,
l've been drinking all afternoon,''

9
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,320
And that way he knows,
one, that you're easy,,,

10
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,840
,,,and two, that you like to drink,

11
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:39,160
l thought a great place to meet girls would
be night school where they teach English,

12
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,920
Because these girls
would be from foreign lands,,,

13
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:45,160
,,,and maybe still a little disoriented
from the journey,,,

14
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,400
,,,and l would look attractive
because l speak English very goodly,

15
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,200
But in the end,
it did not work out as l had hoped,

16
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:56,680
l mean, basically, l was told to
take a hike in 1 4 languages,

17
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,240
Where do you meet people?
l don't know, they're everywhere,

18
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,840
Why, is there a problem?

19
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,360
No, No way,
l'm not going out with this guy,

20
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,560
Just call him, Say hello,
He's in my book club,

21
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,000
-Why is there a woman here?
-lt's his wife,

22
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,360
They're separated, but he didn't want
to Photoshop her out,,,

23
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,920
,,,if you're not interested,
They are in Hawaii,

24
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,240
lt's the Four Seasons,
This could be you in the photograph,

25
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,880
Aloha,

26
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,760
-Well, if you change your mind,
-l've got a picture too,

27
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,480
ls that why you're all here?
The whole family?

28
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,600
-Everyone has a picture for me?
-This is an intervention, Sarah,

29
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,480
-He's great,
-A beautiful girl like you can't just give up,

30
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,880
There's life after divorce,

31
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,520
You were married to the same woman
for 45 years, Dad,

32
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,920
-What do you know about divorce?
-Precious little, l admit,

33
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,320
The black specter of two lives
torn asunder,

34
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,800
Not helping, Dad,

35
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,200
l wish your mother were here,
God rest her soul,

36
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,240
-She'd know what to say,
-''Put on another pot of tea,''

37
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,080
That's what she'd say,
The lrish answer to all problems,

38
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,440
-Well, it worked most of the time,
-Who is this?

39
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,680
l have no idea, but if you're interested,
l'll Google him,

40
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,520
ls this it for food in this house,
like, eight crackers?

41
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,600
And what are these?
Are these bananas?

42
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,520
-l think they were at one time,
-l'll take one,

43
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,760
-l guess l forgot to shop this month,
-What are you gonna do, sis?

44
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,840
-l mean, really, it's been eight months,
-Dad's giving-up idea sounds intriguing,

45
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,160
l could become the crazy aunt
who moves in down in the basement,

46
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,880
Put a cot in for me, some herbal teas,
l'd like to get a dog, if that's okay?

47
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,600
Marc, don't you have
a friend for Sarah?

48
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:36,440
''A Friend for Sarah,'' l'm now an episode
of Little House on the Prairie,

49
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,520
-Come on, you must know somebody,
-Not really,

50
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,960
But if you want to have an affair,
l do know a couple of married guys,

51
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,280
-We'll let that be our fallback, okay?
-Okay,

52
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,640
-An affair, that's a terrific idea,
-My husband to the rescue,

53
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,040
Don't cover mine,

54
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,680
l think affairs should go
on the other side,

55
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,200
Yeah,

56
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,520
Hey, Jake,

57
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,360
Hey, Charlie,

58
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,720
Divorce is final,

59
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,040
You're a free man,

60
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,960
l don't know if,,,is the
appropriate sentiment, Four years,,,

61
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,480
-,,,woman l loved, l got my ass kicked,
-High-five,

62
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,120
Not that kind of moment either,

63
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,640
-Down low?
-Just because l want this to stop,

64
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,880
You are officially the worst client
l've ever had,

65
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,920
-Thank you,
-Let Lisa have everything,

66
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,560
Even the judge wanted you to keep
those boxing gloves,

67
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,960
-She really liked you,
-l liked her too, as far as judges go,

68
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,680
No, l mean, really,

69
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,120
Wow, that's a good-looking Cougar,

70
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:50,560
Excellent stuff, You think she'd like
to buy a handmade, stainable teak boat?

71
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,920
Maybe if it came with private lessons,

72
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,880
Everybody wants all that Tupperware,,,

73
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,920
,,,those computer-designed,
fiberglass-composite things,

74
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,000
l mean, don't even look like boats,

75
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,720
They look like boats when they
whiz by your wooden guy,

76
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,800
That was one race, and l've made
some adjustments, Charlie,

77
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,640
-Wood boats can win, trust me on that,
-They can't win,

78
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,400
That's why people don't want them,

79
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,600
They can't win,
but they lose beautifully,

80
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,920
And the whole experience
is just better, Look at this,

81
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,560
l'm making these boats
the exact same way,,,

82
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,800
,,,the Spanish and the Portuguese
made their ships of exploration,

83
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,520
There's a continuity
at stake here, Charlie,

84
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,560
This is more than a boat,

85
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,120
-This is a time machine,
-lf you paid this much attention to Lisa,,,

86
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,520
-,,,you'd still be together,
-This is true,

87
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,120
But you know what? lf l had to do it
it all over again, l wouldn't,

88
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:42,280
l wouldn't,
Lisa taught me about sadness,,,

89
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,520
,,,about human frailty,,,

90
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,280
,,,and how unbearably fleeting
happiness can be,

91
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,920
-l'm gonna owe her for the rest of my life,
-Oh, you'll be paying, Monthly,

92
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,000
Hope you don't mind
that l brought Mother Teresa,

93
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,240
Are you kidding? l love this girl,
Mother Teresa, do you have a friend for me?

94
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,160
Hey, is everything all right at home?

95
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,480
Yeah, Jennifer just gets tired
of all the family gatherings,

96
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,880
Too many old stories,
lt makes her feel left out,

97
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,520
Yeah, Kevin used to say that,

98
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,280
-l still say it,
-l say it too,

99
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,080
lt seems hard now, Sarah, l know,,,

100
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,840
,,,but you get a chance to make
a new life for yourself,

101
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,480
Thank you, but in
the marketplace of available women--

102
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,720
Any guy would be lucky to get you,
You're smart, you're funny,,,

103
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,360
,,,even pretty when
you're not wallowing in self-pity,

104
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,840
Am l wallowing? Really?

105
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,800
You're not the wallower
in the family, Carol is the wallower,

106
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,680
Me? l never wallow,
l suffer in silence,

107
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,400
-No, that's Christine,
-Thank you, Michael,

108
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,120
No, no,

109
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,200
-Sylvia Plath,
-This is why people,,,

110
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,160
,,,don't have large families anymore,

111
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,720
-Bye, l love you,
-Bye,

112
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,960
-Bye, Bill,
-Love you, Carol,

113
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,640
-See you, Dad,
-Thank you, l think,

114
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,960
Bye, Chris, Bye,

115
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,600
-See you later, Dad,
-Bye, Daddy,

116
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,800
Bye,

117
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,880
There's someone special
waiting for you, Sarah,

118
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,600
l know it, Someone worthy,

119
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,320
Kevin was not, on his best day,,,

120
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,000
,,,good enough for you, sweetheart,

121
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,240
Now you tell me,

122
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,040
Why not?

123
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:35,440
You know l love you and l love Lisa,
but l think you're both better off,

124
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,520
We sure weren't making each other
happy there at the end,

125
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,520
Or the beginning,

126
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,360
Or the middle,

127
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:48,200
l mean, don't get me wrong, we all
wanted to sleep with Lisa, but marriage,,,,

128
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,720
-That's not right,
-l said that out loud, didn't l?

129
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,840
-You did,
-l better strike that from the record,

130
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,080
No, lawyers get to do that,
l'm instructing you to disregard that,

131
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,000
l think women have
the whole thing planned,

132
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,520
Really, the whole thing,

133
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,040
An epic narrative in their heads,
You know my theory about this?

134
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,480
When you meet,
they have the whole story written,

135
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,360
But you don't get to read it,

136
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,960
But if you go off script,,,

137
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,680
,,,right? They write you out
of the story,

138
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,560
l got written out of Act 3,

139
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,240
Now you're in Act 4, where l get you
banged every night of the week,

140
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,960
Charlie, l'm toast, l just got shredded,
l am--

141
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,960
-lt's time, healing time, l'm on the bench,
-Hey, Hey,

142
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,680
l'm out of the game,
Bench me, bench me,

143
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,480
-Hey,
-Benched,

144
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,400
l'll be right with you,

145
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,760
-Hi, Can l help you?
-Single chicken breast, please,

146
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,480
For an extra 75 cents,
you can get the whole fryer here,

147
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,440
Two breasts, two thighs and a wing,

148
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,840
Thank you, l don't know
when l'd eat all that,

149
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,600
-lt's just an extra 75 cents,
-lt's not the 75 cents,

150
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,360
l hate to see food go bad,

151
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,800
We got a hundred recipes,
You can cook them, freeze them and--

152
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,280
Look, listen to me, mister,
l'm divorced, okay?

153
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,640
l eat alone,
usually standing over the sink,

154
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,880
l don't want chicken
hanging around, okay?

155
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,040
-Okay,
-Thank you,

156
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:29,000
Hey, There she is,

157
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,840
-Good morning, How are you?
-Good morning,

158
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,120
l called you last night
to see if you were up for a movie,,,

159
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:44,800
-,,,or bowling or group shampooing,
-l'm sorry, Eric's parents are in town,

160
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,360
Mr, and Mrs, Stalin,
l'm under house arrest,

161
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,120
-Weren't they just here?
-Thank you,

162
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:52,840
l don't know why they can't stay at
a hotel, Nothing l do makes them happy,

163
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,880
And they make Eric so nervous,
he's like the Tin Man,

164
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,960
You have to hang in there, Leo,
You and Eric are my model,,,

165
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:02,080
-,,,for a successful relationship,
-l fear for you, child,

166
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,440
Anyone have anything exciting
happen this weekend to share?

167
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,200
My Uncle Mike slept over,

168
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,240
Uncles and aunts
are very important to us, aren't they?

169
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:14,400
He's not really my uncle,
but my mommy makes me call him that,

170
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:20,160
When he's there, l can't sleep with
my mommy because he's in her bed,

171
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,560
Anyone else have anything
they'd like to share?

172
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,120
Yes, Austin,

173
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,320
My parents are trying it
apart for a while,

174
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,680
-We have a theme, June,
-Yes, we do,

175
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:34,240
And Mom says my dad is incorrigible,
That means he likes other women,

176
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,480
Good,

177
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,920
One, two,

178
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,120
Let me try,

179
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,960
That's a hop,

180
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,960
One, two, that's a new step,
Very good,

181
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,040
-Molly, you wanna try the sticks?
-Yeah, come on, Molly,

182
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,640
Very good, Keep it going like that,

183
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,480
-Watch,
-No, l'm doing it,

184
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,520
Austin!

185
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,320
Good Lord, it's a gusher,

186
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,760
Let me see your teeth,

187
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,760
-Hey, bubba,
-Look who's here,

188
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,280
Daddy!

189
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,600
-Are you all right?
-Yep, l'm fine,

190
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,080
He had a decent bloody nose
for a while, but he's fine now,

191
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:31,360
-You didn't have to rush right over,
-A kid bleeds, l show up, lt's house rules,

192
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,640
-You wanna get your stuff together now?
-Yeah,

193
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,040
-Then l need a minute alone with Ms, Nolan,
-Okay, Bye, Ms, Nolan,

194
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,960
Bye,

195
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,440
No, No, No,

196
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,200
So, Ms, Nolan,,,,

197
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,880
-Sarah, please,
-And l'm Bob,

198
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,720
Actually, everybody calls me Bobby,

199
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,080
l've been trying to change it
since third grade,

200
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,640
l'm a pushover for Bobbys,,,

201
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,680
,,,ever since my first boyfriend,
Bobby Healy, just,,,,

202
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,120
You know?

203
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:16,760
l forget, is it ''always discuss your personal
history with parents'' or ''never discuss''?

204
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,400
lt's ''always discuss,''
Besides, l find it comforting,

205
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,000
So has Austin told you
anything about,,,?

206
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,720
-About you and--
-Yeah,

207
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:28,880
That you're taking a break from
your marriage and you're incorrigible,

208
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,760
That phrasing came from his mother,

209
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,640
-l wouldn't have put it that way, but--
-l'm sorry,

210
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,280
lf there's anything you think
l need to know, tell me,

211
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,680
-l will,
-Sometimes with Austin, you can forget,

212
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,680
-Because he seems so mature,
-l know,

213
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,200
The other day he asked
about my retirement plan,

214
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,760
Well, he cares about you, and he
wants you to be financially secure,

215
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:50,440
You know Austin adores you,
l can see why,

216
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:54,040
-Thank you, Bob,
-l might prefer Bobby after all,

217
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,760
l mean, l like the,,,,
l like the history,

218
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,200
Two guys alone in the afternoon
watching Doctor Zhivago,

219
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,600
-There's something gravely wrong here,
-lt's all there, man,

220
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,200
The yearning, the suffering,
a woman you'll pursue,,,

221
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,280
,,,through blizzards, across continents,

222
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,560
A love so real,
even after you're dead it still hurts,

223
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,160
-That's all l want,
-You need to get out,

224
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,280
-You do, You need to see real people,
-You wanna watch it again?

225
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,680
No, l want to go out, Come on,
l previewed some lnternet ads for us,

226
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,920
lnternet ads? Come on,
l want Zhivago's lnternet ad:

227

,,,like-minded playmate
for long snowshoe across Eurasia,''

229
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,200
What do you bet he gets
a hundred responses?

230
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,040
We'll start with bisexual
Asian women who fly-fish,

231
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,840
-No lnternet ads,
-This is for you, l hate to fly-fish,

232
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,680
-No, you don't,
-What about Sherry?

233
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,720
-l gave you her number, You never called,
-Sherry?

234
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,720
Sherry's 24, Her range of interest
extends from kickboxing to Tae Bo,

235
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,000
She slept with half the guys
in my office,

236
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,280
Then why do you want
to set me up with her?

237
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,800
She slept with half the guys
in my office,

238
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:08,000
She's in her early 20s, You know
the epic narrative l talked about?

239
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,920
Hers would not only be secret,
it would be incoherent,

240
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,200
l wouldn't get past the cover page,

241
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,040
l mean, l'm looking
for something more than Sherry,

242
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,880

You aren't a hawk eyeing its prey,''

256
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:05,200

''Two, men respond sexually when

What are you doing here?

But by any other name,,,,

-And it's for a lady friend, isn't it?

-No!
-Now, Sarah, come on,

approval to me every day,

lt shows l brought you up to know
the diamond from the riffraff,

you rode a bike?

-Meandering or any other way?
-Well, think of it as poetry, darling,

290
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,360
As who l am
in the bottom of my soul,

l'm seeing someone else at 4:00,

296
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:42,280
Hello. You've reached Sarah Nolan.
Leave a message if you want to.

297
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,320
Sarah, it's me, Christine. Pick up.

298
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,160
Come on, Sarah,
I already talked to Dad.

299
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,920
-Who else knows?
-No one.

300
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,360
Come on, Carol has to know,

301
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,400
Why does Carol have to know? Couldn't
I once know something before she does?

302
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,040
She's there with you, isn't she?

303
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,240
-No.
-Hello, Carol,

304
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,440
Hi, Sarah. I was telling Chris it's a shame
I didn't know about this before...

305
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,840
...because I could have called
Uncle Chet. We could have doubled.

306
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,080
Oh, no.

307
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:24,120
This story is going to be immortalized
into family history, isn't it?

308
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:27,960
Told and retold
at Thanksgiving dinner, year after year,

309
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:32,160
Oh, not just Thanksgiving.
I think it's a good Christmas story too.

310
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,200
-Bye, guys,
-Wait.

311
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:37,960
Tell the truth. On a scale of one to 1 0,
how would you rate Dad as a date?

312
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,000
Hot, super hot?

313
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:50,160
Don't be mad at me for this, okay?

314
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,600
The last time you said that to me
you stole my boyfriend, Danny Shea,

315
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,600
l did not steal Danny Shea,

316
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:01,000
-l haven't forgiven you, by the way,
-Stop, He was a terrible kisser,

317
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,000
-He kissed just fine with me,
-Okay, Here goes,

318
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,400
l went online, pretended l was you,,,

319
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,200
,,,and put your profile
on PerfectMatch,com,

320
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,120
You're making this up,

321
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,040
You can't just sit back
and passively answer,,,

322
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,440
,,,other people's ads anymore,
We are on offense,

323
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,000
Well, forgive me if l'm a tad gun-shy
after my last date with my father,

324
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,440
Come on, at least look at your profile,

325
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,960
That's my high school
graduation picture,

326
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,600
That's all l had,
That or your wedding photo,

327
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,360
''Voluptuous''? Carol!

328
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,880
Every woman listed claims
to be at least voluptuous,

329
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:43,200
Some are ''gorgeous inside and out,''
most are ''sexually confident,''

330
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:48,160
''Voluptuous, sensuous DWF seeks
special man to share starlit nights,

331
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,680
-Must love dogs,''
-l put that in for you,

332
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,800
And yet l'm still pissed,

333
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,320
l must have done something right,
You have 1 8 responses,

334
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,560
You listened to them, didn't you?

335
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,000
l like three, 1 1 and 1 4,
Christine likes two and eight,

336
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,000
Michael liked them all,
But you decide for yourself,

337
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,640
What do you mean by voluptuous?
Do you mean big breasts...

338
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,680
...or do you mean fat?

339
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,680
I love dogs too.

340
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:50,520
I have a great sense of humor,
but you could probably already tell that.

341
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,520
Yo.

342
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,960
My name is Walter Taylor.
I'm an attorney.

343
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:00,640
Don't hang up.
I like opera. Don't delete me.

344
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,480
So anyway, l get all dressed up,,,

345
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,320
,,,and l walk down the stairs and l see,,,

346
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:12,680
,,,my father sitting there
holding a single yellow rose,

347
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,440
And it dawns on me,,,,

348
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:19,360
-ls something wrong?
-Well, no offense, it's just,,,,

349
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,200
l thought you'd be younger, that's all,

350
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,600
Well, you said your age range
was 25 to 45,

351
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,440
l guess l was hoping more for 25,

352
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,560
Twenty-three,

353
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,840
Eighteen, That's legal,

354
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,480
lt's nice to be out,

355
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,560
l've been feeling kind of blue lately,

356
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:49,440
l know, you mentioned on the phone,
Lennie, that you've-- Kind of depressed,

357
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,160
-Did l cry?
-Well, a little bit,

358
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:55,840
l've been on 1 7 first dates this year,

359
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,240
No second dates,

360
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:01,040
One went,,,

361
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,320
,,,to check her coat
and never came back,

362
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:09,040
One jumped out at the light
when it changed,

363
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:14,080
Well, we're almost through the salad,
That's a good sign,

364
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,600
No,

365
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,720
Lennie,

366
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,800
Please, Don't,

367
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,720
Please, Lennie, No,

368

If you're happy and you know it

00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,480
Oh, God!

Come on, get up,
Get her, Get her,

373
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,640
Damn,

374
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,280
Don't be upset,
l come from a large family,

375
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:48,360
Lots of male cousins, brothers,
Used to this sort of thing,

376
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,120
Three out of five,

377
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,680
-Oh, that's all right, Maybe later,
-Come on,

378
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:55,920
-Your table's almost ready,
-Good, We're working up an appetite,

379
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,720
Food here is fabulous,
lt's not cheap, though,

380
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,240
Well, l offered to pay my half,

381
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,400
And what did l tell you?

382
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:06,280
''Marshall's girls don't pay,''

383
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,920
Beautiful,

384
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,200
You'd look really good in handcuffs,

385
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,400
Charlie, my boy,
some nice-looking pieces here,

386
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:25,040
-Really? l didn't see anyone,
-l meant the artwork,

387
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,120
-Bet this cost a bundle,
-Hey, guys,

388
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,840
-Hi!
-Speaking of artwork,

389
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:33,280
-Hi, Sherry,
-Hi, Charlie, Hi, Jake,

390

How are you? Let's do two,

391
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,840
-That's how they do it in France,
-You having fun?

392
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,640
Well, l feel sorry for the artist
at these things,

393
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:45,360
All this talent on display,
and everybody here's just trying to get laid,

394
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,040
l know l am,

395
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,280
You never called me, mister,
l waited and waited,

396
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,080
l know l am,

397
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:57,280
l'm sorry, Sherry, it's just that l'm not ready
right now to be in a serious relationship,

398
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,320
And with somebody as wonderful
and as beautiful as you,,,

399
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,360
,,,l just wouldn't expect
anything less,

400
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,240
-Why can't you be sweet like that, huh?
-Sherry!

401
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,240
-Hey, guys,
-Short attention span,

402
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,240
You're a sick guy, you know that?

403
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,080
Just another in a long line
of colossal mistakes,

404
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,240
l'm not answering an lnternet ad,

405
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,600
Look at this, ''Voluptuous and sensuous,
Must love dogs,'' Wonderful,

406
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,400
Look at the picture,

407
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,000
Well, she is appealing,

408
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,160
She'll be good-looking
when she grows up,

409
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,040
l'm surfing porn sites like always,,,

410
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,600
,,,l keep getting kicked over
to PerfectMatch,com,,,

411
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,600
,,,which is not where l want to be,,,

412
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:42,200
,,,and this girl's profile keeps repeating, like
a sign from heaven, And l thought of you,

413
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,840
Tell the prom queen thanks, but no,
l'm still benched,

414
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,240
Too late, You're meeting her at 1 1 ,
Bring a dog,

415

No, l'm not,

00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,480
lt's okay,

Stop that growling!

418
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,120
Use your words,

419
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,640
Stop, sit,

420
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,360
Stop, sit,

421
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:15,160
-Stop, Sit,
-l don't think he knows ''stop'' or ''sit,''

422
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:18,240
-What else have you got?
-Bruno, focus,

423
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,240
Roll over and play dead,

424
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:25,160
-Hey, look at that, Look at that,
-That's very impressive,

425
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:30,040
-You Sarah?
-Jake,

426
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,840
-Yeah, hi,
-Yeah, Hi,

427
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:37,760
l didn't recognize you
without the cap and gown,

428
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,680
Oh, yeah,

429
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,360
-Yeah,
-Yeah,

430
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:45,760
-This is really amazing,
-Yeah,

431
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,400
lt is, When he plays dead,
he really plays dead,

432
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,040
You don't know the half of it,
He can stop his heart like a Sufi mystic,

433
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,480
-Does he sleep on a doggy bed of nails?
-As a matter of fact, he does,

434
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:59,440
He feels nothing,
Or perhaps he feels too much,

435
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,360
-l think he wants his treat now,
-You think so?

436
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,840
While he's playing dead?
lt might ruin the effect,

437
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,360
-l don't know, He's your dog,
-He's not, He's my friend Charlie's,

438
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,160
-So you're here under false pretenses,
-No, not at all,

439
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:17,080
You said ''must love dogs,''
not ''must own dogs,'' l do love dogs,

440
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,760
ln fact, l had one with my ex,

441
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,240
She was allergic,
went into anaphylactic shock,

442
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,400
So we had to put her down, Dog,

443
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:27,040
Not the wife, l'm kidding about both,

444
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,240
This is a beautiful canine
you have here,

445
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,960
-Hi,
-Yes, this is Mother Teresa,

446
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,240
Yeah, she plays with lepers?

447
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,600
Comforts the poor? Yeah,
How long you had her?

448
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,320
Technically, she's not really mine,
She's my brother's,

449
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,320
l'm shocked and saddened,

450
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:52,640
-False pretenses,
-Well, we are related, She's family,

451
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:56,800
And l do really love dogs,
and my ex was allergic also,

452
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,640
Yes, he often had
''anaphyphlectic'' shock,

453
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,240
You're making that up,

454
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,080
-Yes, l am,
-Me too,

455
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,560
Tell me, l'm just curious
about one thing,

456
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,400
Why did you write ''voluptuous''?

457
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,200
-Oh, my--
-No! l did not mean to be rude at all,

458
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,240
lt's just that voluptuous,
that tends to go the other way,,,

459
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,920
,,,when someone uses that phrase,

460
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:22,160
Towards the full-figured end
of the spectrum,

461
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,640
l didn't know there was
a full-figured spectrum,

462
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,280
lt's one of those words
they use in personal ads,,,

463
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,200
,,,like ''Rubenesque''
or ''weight proportionate to height,''

464
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,000
Hey, it's your ad, You can say
whatever you want, l'm,,,,

465
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:38,360
Just for the record, girl says ''athletic,''
she means ''flat-chested,'' Which you're not,

466
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,760
But-- This isn't coming out right,

467
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,280
Look, you know, l'm sorry,

468
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:46,920
l'm,,,, l'm a little nervous, l'm not used
to meeting people this way,

469
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,080
Really? You seem very practiced
and smooth,

470
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:54,680
-Your ad doesn't do you justice,
-Well, maybe you should rewrite my ad,

471
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,200
-Well, maybe l don't want to,
-And why not?

472
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,200
Because maybe l don't want
anyone else to answer it,

473
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,000
Did you plan on saying
that sometime today?

474
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,160
-No, l didn't, But it's good, isn't it?
-lt is good,

475
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:11,200
-lt's a good line,
-Maybe we should try this over again,

476
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,480
Hi, l'm Jake,

477
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,160
Sarah,

478
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,720
So why would you even write an ad?
You don't seem that desperate,

479
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,080
Why would you answer one?
Talk about desperate,

480
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:24,160
l'm not, l mean, l didn't,
lt was my friend's, He gave it to me,

481
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,760
-l didn't write it, My sister did,
-Your sister's ad,

482
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,640
Your brother's dog,
Those your shoes?

483
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:33,400
Oh, my, Look at the time!
Come on, honey,

484
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:36,120
What l'm trying to say is
l'd like to get to know you,

485
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:39,680
l have to get this dog home, and you
don't want to go over on your rental,

486
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:43,600
Maybe we could try this another time,
You know, without the dogs,

487
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,760
You bet,

488
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,520
l'll call you,

489
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,920
Sarah, for the record,,,

490
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:55,240
,,,you are kind of voluptuous
in a minimalist sort of way,

491
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,480
l'm not sure l'm up for this dinner
at Dad's new girlfriend's house,

492
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,480
-He seems really excited about her,
-Where are Marc and Jason?

493
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,320
They took the kids
to Magic Mountain,

494
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:12,400
The kids didn't even really
want to go, The dads whined,

495
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,640
Well, they're so spoiled, those dads,

496
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,080
So how was your day today?
At the dog park?

497
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:20,400
-How did you know about that?
-Who do you think you're dealing with?

498
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,880
-You're good, l have to give you that,
-So come on,

499
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,400
-Tell me,
-Okay,

500
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,760
We got off to kind of a rough start,
But then it was okay, you know?

501
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:31,240
He was a little intense, He was nervous,
He couldn't stop insulting me,

502
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,080
You know what this sounds like,

503
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:36,360
-No, it's not, Don't say it,
-But it is, lt's a growth opportunity,

504
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:39,560
l'm not over my last growth opportunity
when you stole Danny Shea,

505
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:43,160
Will you forget Danny Shea?
He's probably a convicted felon,,,

506
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,000
,,,by now, divorced,

507
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,000
-Maybe you should call him,
-Carol,

508
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:50,600
What about that guy you met
at preschool? You maimed his kid?

509
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,080
-Bob Connor,
-Yeah, Mr, lncorrigible,

510
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:56,080
l told you, l can't,
He's the father of one of my students,

511
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,960
Yes, honey, but he's not your father,
That's a big step forward for you,

512
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,520
-Bill,
-Dolly,

513
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,280
Hey!

514
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,960
-What a lovely home you have, Dolly,
-Thank you,

515
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:36,640
When my third husband died,
l decided to give up the big house,

516
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,600
Third out of how many?

517
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,520
And these potholders?

518
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,080
Where did you manage to find them?

519
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:48,960
Why, everything in this house
is handmade by Dolly,

520
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,440
Oh, yes, She's very creative,

521
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:54,440
Our mother used to sew all our clothes
when we were younger,

522
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,400
-Sarah,
-Well, she did,

523
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,840
Your father told me
all about your mother, honey,

524
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,120
She must have been
a very special lady,

525
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,520
-She was,
-And you must miss her very much,

526
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,680
-l do,
-And you see me,,,

527
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,920
,,,as something of an interloper,
l suppose,

528
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,760
Do you want me to lie down for this?

529
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,600
We're at interloping?
When did that happen?

530
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,040
lt's Dad's life, l don't meddle,

531
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,520
Carol, you meddle
in my life all the time,

532
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:26,320
Well, technically that's not true,
because you don't have a life,

533
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,200
l happen to have a very full life,

534
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,240
Did you even check
all of your messages?

535
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,560
l thought a few were very promising,

536
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:35,920
-Like who?
-Like the engineer from Oxnard,

537
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:39,320
-With the sexual dysfunction,
-ln what way would he be promising?

538
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:42,000
You could cure him,
The whole nurse-patient thing,

539
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:45,640
-You've got it all worked out,
-lt was brave of him to be so forthcoming,

540
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,920
-Why don't you call him, then,
-Why don't you,

541
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,240
-Call! l'll give you his number,
-Maybe l will,

542
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,400
-Go for it,
-Okay,

543
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,440
Hey there, Ms, Nolan,

544
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,960
What are you doing yelling
in Whispering Breeze Park?

545
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,680
Look who it is,

546
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,120
-What a surprise,
-Oh, hi, Ms, Nolan, How are you?

547
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,480
-Hi, sweetie,
-Who's that?

548
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:06,080
-Oh, this is my sister Carol,
-Nice to meet you,

549
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,760
This is Austin, my student,
and his dad, Mr, Connor, Bob,

550
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,600
Actually, l go by Bobby now,

551
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,560
Right, You live here?

552
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,320
Yeah, they cater to the recently
separated and divorced,

553
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:20,880
But l'm the youngest guy here
by 40 years, so it's good for my morale,

554
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,880
-My wife and l are gonna try it apart,
-l know,

555
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,400
Will you just look at her, son?

556
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,960
ls my little girl lovely
or is my little girl lovely?

557
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,760
Oh, Dad, don't worry
about embarrassing me,

558
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,680
Stop it, Bill,
She is cute as a button, though,

559
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,520
So, what is it you do, Bobby?
Sarah never tells us about her beaus,

560
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,880
l'm finishing my Ph,D,
in American history,

561
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,840
-A biography of Robert E, Lee,
-l always felt sorry for Lee,

562
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:49,080
Forced to fight against his old friends
and West Point classmates,

563
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,640
Could only dress in gray, Sad,

564
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,760
She's funny too,
A complete package, you know,

565
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,400
When l need extra money,
l work construction,

566
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,000
Well, it sounds very manly,
Do you wear a hardhat?

567
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,480
Sarah was the one who always had
the boys knocking at the door,

568
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,280
-Oh, Dad,
-She had eyes only for that singer,

569
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,320
What was his name? Thin fellow,

570
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,640
-Looked like a girl,
-Mick Jagger,

571
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:14,480
No, no, Sarah was saving herself
for David Cassidy,

572
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:15,880
Like you weren't,

573
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:19,520
-Carol wasn't saving herself for anybody,
-What?

574
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:23,360
l remember now, lt was David Cassidy
of The Pheasant Family,

575
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,040
Bill, Bill, honey,

576
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:28,360
Partridge Family, You know,
l saw him last year in Vegas,

577
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,160
He was good, Hadn't changed a bit,
Same turtleneck,

578
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,760
Sarah had the whole
Partridge act down,

579
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,440
She'd put on the little miniskirt,
the go-go boots,,,

580
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,200
,,,and pretend she was Susan Dey,

581
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:41,360
-This is all a lie,
-Sing the theme song, Sarah,

582
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:45,440
-Don't make me kill you, Carol,
-You remember the intro,

583
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,560
-No,
-Come on,

584
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,880
Come on,

585
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,920
Oh, that was what he told you,

586
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:49,000
-lt was a great night,
-Great night,

587
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:52,560
l forgot how much fun those
humiliating family sing-alongs can be,

588
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,040
Can l say one thing
about Mr, lncorrigible?

589
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:59,120
-Only if you sing it,
-He is hot, And he likes you,

590
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:02,480
l can't, lt's just my luck,
He's the father of one of my students,

591
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:07,120
He has a Ph,D, and a great ass,
Let's not get dragged down by ethics,

592
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,280
Technically, he doesn't have
his Ph,D, yet,

593
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,760
-But yes, the ass thing, l know,
-God, let's not even mention the eyes,

594
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,920
-The crinkly smile,
-No, That would be wrong,

595
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,240
-So can l ask you a question?
-No,

596
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:22,040
You never would have left Kevin,
Would you?

597
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,960
lf he hadn't left me?
No, l don't think so,

598
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,800
But you weren't really happy,

599
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:33,120
Well, l figured that was the life l picked,
so l had to make the most of it,

600
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,600
l'm not even sure
l deserve a new life now,

601
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,160
Sometimes l think that was supposed
to be my one chance and l blew it,

602
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:42,400
Where did we get these bad attitudes,
you think?

603
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,760
-The nuns?
-Yeah, that works,

604
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,760
Let's blame the nuns,
Can l say one more thing?

605
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,240
You love me, l know,

606
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,720
l do,

607
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,360
l mean, l was really bad,
She did not see my A game,

608
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,640
Sounds like she didn't see
your B or C game,

609
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:04,960
l'm gonna call her again,
l want to ask her out, l need a mulligan,

610
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,160
Dog threw me,
l mean, the sun was in my eyes,

611
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,760
Pick someone else, start over,

612
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,600
No, this girl, there's something
special about this girl,

613
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,040
You know the expression
''she took my breath away''?

614
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:18,360
l mean, she did, l actually gasped,
l'm off the bench, man,

615
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:21,120
Think she'll see you again?
l wouldn't,

616
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,280
You're not nice,
Like, you're not a nice person,

617
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,240
-Hi, June,
-Hey, June,

618
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,440
-Hi, June,
-Hey, June,

619
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:34,560
Need more cupcakes,
All the dads are staying for the party,

620
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,520
-What's up with that?
-l have no idea,

621
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,800
Every Halloween it's the same thing,

622
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,560
But l guess it's great how involved
they are in their kids' world, lsn't it?

623
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,000
-Yeah,
-Yeah,

624
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,920
Why don't you and Eric come over,

625
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:50,680
l'll rent a hopelessly romantic movie,
We can all hold hands together and cry,

626
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,720
Sounds fun, but we can't,

627
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,840
lt's our anniversary, and we always
spend it just the two of us,

628
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,200
Sweet,

629
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,800
Seven years ago tonight,
we met at my parents' house,

630
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,760
They were trying to fix Eric up
with my sister,

631
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,040
Sorry we're late,

632
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,880
Austin drives so slow,

633
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,320
l hope my family
wasn't embarrassing last night,

634
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:16,640
Oh, no, Not at all, They do seem
a little bit involved in your life,

635
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,000
Oh, yeah, Yeah,

636
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,000
Austin's mom's from a large family,

637
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,520
That's a lot of people
that don't speak to me,

638
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:27,360
-Thimbleful of juice?
-Sure, But just one,

639
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,440
-To good teachers,
-To good dads,

640
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:33,040
To good teachers
who are also very beautiful,

641
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:38,920
To good dads who
are dangerously cute and charming,

642
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,440
There you go,

643
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,640
There's an attraction here, Sarah,
You can't deny it,

644
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,320
-l'm not, l'm trying to ignore it,
-Why?

645
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,320
Well, for one, Austin is my student,

646
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,560
Two, we're in the puppet closet,

647
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:01,760
-Couldn't we go out in the real world?
-l'm not so good in the real world,

648
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:06,240
l was looking at the handbook,
under ''dating, parents and teachers,''

649
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,720
-Nothing, There's nothing there,
-Sarah,

650
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:13,680
We need the emergency pants,
lt's an emergency,

651
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,880
Emergency pants,
Come on, sweetie,

652
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,760
Hey, babe, my name is Ron.

653
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:33,920
Mid-40s, handsome, totally toned,
5'7", 1 61 pounds...

654
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,920
...give or take a piece of pizza.

655
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:39,600
No, I'm not kidding. I'm totally toned.
Call me, you won't be sorry.

656
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,800
Hi, Sarah, it's Lennie.

657
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,800
I had a wonderful time, and I'm....

658
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,280
I'll call back.

659
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:57,320
Hi, Sarah? It's Jake Anderson,
the idiot from the dog park.

660
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,280
Actually, that was all a test
to see how you respond...

661
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,800
...to crazy people, and you passed.

662
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,720
So maybe we could see
each other again.

663
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,480
What do you say?
You want to give me another chance?

664
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,960
l had a couple of icebreakers,

665
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:23,320
l even had a few stories for you,
anecdotes, but l forgot them all,

666
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,560
-l think it might be that dress,
-My sister Carol made me buy it,

667
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,720
l love Carol,

668
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,440
-Well, this is a very charming place,
-Yeah,

669
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:37,000
-Good food?
-No, not particularly,

670
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,760
But l like the ambiance,

671
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:42,600
l come here because l know the owners,
the Parseghians, that couple over there,

672
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,040
-See? They're waving,
-They want us to join them,

673
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,440
A few years ago, in a moment
of blazing clarity,,,

674
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,920
,,,l forswore ethnic folk dancing, so,,,,

675
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:54,480
They'll come over and say hello
and maybe-- How are you? Hi!

676
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,920
-How are you?
-Hello,

677
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,560
Nice, right?

678
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,840
-Sarah, Mr, and Mrs, Parseghian,
-Hello,

679
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,280
-Welcome, Sarah,
-Thank you,

680
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,480
See you later, We'll drink,

681
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,560
-Absolutely,
-Okay,

682
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,680
-You speak Armenian,
-A little bit,

683
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,280
Well, what did you say?

684
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,720
l asked him, ''Where is the youth hostel?''
lt's all l remember,

685
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:30,520
Kind of a joke we have,

686
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,600
What is it that you do, exactly?

687
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,200
God, no wonder l live alone,

688
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,920
l build boats,

689
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,480
You know, these handcrafted
wooden sculls,,,

690
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,200
-,,,rowing, The racing ones,
-Yeah, Really?

691
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,240
Yeah, Yep,

692
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,960
-Does anyone buy those?
-Nope, Not yet,

693
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,480
Everybody wants all these high-tech,,,

694
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:54,040
,,,fiberglass, you know, no turbulence,

695
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:56,280
Where's the fun in that ride?
l don't know,

696
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:59,360
-But they'll come around,
-Don't count on me, l get seasick,

697
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:00,840
-ln the bathtub,
-Really?

698
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,280
Yeah,

699
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,880
You know what?
Can we just skip all the small talk?

700
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:10,440
-What?
-Can we skip the small talk? Just skip it?

701
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:13,320
You know, like, who are you?
Who am l?

702
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,000
What are we doing here together?

703
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:17,840
l have this theory that
when you first meet somebody,,,

704
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,640
,,,that's the time when
you have to be totally honest,,,

705
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,480
,,,because you have nothing to lose,

706
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,800
Five, 1 0 years down the road,
gets a lot harder,

707
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,560
You can't say one day,
''Happy anniversary, this is me,''

708
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,960
lt doesn't work that way, This is it,

709
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:33,680
We'll never see each other as clearly
and as nakedly as we do in this moment,

710
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:37,680
Right now, This instant, l'm really
scaring you right now, aren't l?

711
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:40,320
Just a little bit, Yeah,

712
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,760
But, you know, on the one hand,,,

713
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,680
,,,you're very charming and interesting
and you have a lot of energy,

714
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,160
You know, on the other hand,
a little bit scary,

715
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,640
Okay,

716
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,960
Here's my story,
Here's what you need to know,

717
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,680
Okay,

718
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:57,360
l'm just divorced,
and l had my heart broken badly,,,

719
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:00,000
,,,by a woman that l really loved,

720
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:04,360
You know, but l think your heart
grows back bigger,

721
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:07,320
You know? Once you've got
the shit beat out of you,

722
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,480
And the universe lets
your heart expand that way,

723
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:14,600
l think that's the function of all this pain
and heartache that we all go through,

724
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:18,640
You gotta go through that to come out
to a better place, And that's how l see it,

725
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,480
What about you? Why is
a dazzling woman like you single?

726
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,520
You can do it,
You can just tell the truth,

727
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:31,080
lf you know the truth,
What have we got to lose?

728
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:35,000
After the dinner we shake hands,
''good night,'' never see each other again,

729
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:37,040
All right,

730
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,440
He stopped loving me,

731
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:46,320
l don't know what l did
or what l didn't do,

732
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,440
He just stopped,

733
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,560
l don't think l've ever said
that out loud before,

734
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:04,200
See, we just had
an honest moment,

735
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:06,480
Now we can sit back
and enjoy our food,,,

736
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,440
,,,and get to know each other,
l'm Jake,

737
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,120
-Condom?
-You don't have one?

738
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:27,520
-Why would l have one?
-For occasions like this,

739
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,880
There haven't been
any occasions like this,

740
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:32,560
-You didn't bring one?
-l didn't want to jinx it,

741
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,600
This preschool of yours,
it's traditional? Developmental?

742
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,160
-Montessori?
-Yeah, yeah, All that, Drugstore!

743
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,520
There's a Rite Aid on 93rd,
Hang a left,

744
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:01,920
-Should l take the freeway?
-Please turn left!

745
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:11,760
-ls this the fastest you can go?
-l could go faster, but we'd lift off,

746
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:18,680
-You drive,
-All right,

747
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:24,280
For big ones, you need five,
six coats of varnish,

748
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,920
For the singles,
it's a little bit different,

749
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:29,040
There's one right there, Jackpot!

750
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,520
They're out!

751
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:41,560
-How can they be out?
-l don't know,

752
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:43,800
But l have a theory,

753
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:46,680
Everybody in the whole city
is having sex,,,

754
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:49,800
,,,at the exact same moment
except us.

755
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:52,720
But we will press on,

756
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:14,960
What's wrong?

757
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:21,400
Well, the magic is gone a little,

758
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:23,800
Okay,

759
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:25,920
-l mean, l--
-No, no, l understand totally,

760
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:28,240
Look, you know,
There's other things we can do,

761
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:31,680
l'd be happy just to stay with you
and look at you all night,

762
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:35,040
Yeah, l haven't done this
in a while, And,,,,

763
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:37,320
-And now you don't want to,
-Yeah,

764
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:38,680
-Yeah,
-Yeah,

765
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,360
That's all right, lf the magic's gone,
that implies there was once magic,

766
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,080
Not bad for a first date,

767
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:47,360
-Second date,
-Second date, This is great,

768
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:49,600
-l had a great time,
-Me too,

769
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,040
So,,,

770
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,240
,,,good night,

771
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:03,080
-You still have to drive me home, though,
-Right, Because you don't live here,

772
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:07,160
Hello,

773
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:11,200
Don't worry, it's just me, l'm in
the kitchen, Filled your freezer again,

774
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,840
There's now enough meat
to feed every guy,,,

775
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,400
,,,who answered your ad and still--

776
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:20,280
-Jake Anderson, my sister Carol,
-Hi,

777
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:24,840
-Hi,
-Jake did, in fact, answer the ad,

778
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:26,640
Do l get my meat?

779
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,680
Thank you,

780
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:41,760
Sorry to scare him away,

781
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:45,120
lt's okay, l think we both realized
it wasn't going to happen tonight,

782
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:47,440
What's the matter? He's so cute,

783
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:51,680
l don't know, We had a great night,
Laughing, really talking,

784
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:54,440
You had a guy talking
and you let him escape?

785
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:57,440
l'm not sure l actually understood
a lot of what he said,

786
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,160
Doesn't matter, He spoke,

787
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:01,960
And are we talking full sentences here
or just grunting?

788
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:04,840
He's quite emotional,
l know more about him than Kevin,

789
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:08,240
An emotional man who likes to talk,

790
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:11,880
-This is a mythical figure, Sarah,
-l don't think l'm ready for him,

791
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:15,360
He's looking for the whole dance
and l'm just relearning the steps,

792
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:19,280
What happened exactly?
Come on, tell me,

793
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:21,120
-Leave nothing out,
-Okay,

794
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:23,760
We really connected
at the restaurant, like l said,

795
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,680
But then, where do you go from there?
How much baba ganoush can you have?

796
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:30,960
Then we started making out,
which was like being in 1 1 th grade,

797
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:34,800
Then neither one of us had a condom,
which l think reflects some ambivalence,

798
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,640
l'm just not cut out for this,
Life in the fast lane,

799
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:40,840
Fast lane? You're not even
on the on-ramp,

800
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:44,720
-But these people seem happy,
-Of course they do, They have a condom,

801
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:47,840
Marc and l couldn't find a condom once,
Wanna know what we used?

802
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:50,320
-No,
-Saran Wrap,

803
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:54,040
Thanks for that image which will
stay in my brain for the rest of my life,

804
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:57,240
lt was sexy in a Good Housekeeping
kind of way,

805
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:00,160
l'll never be able to wrap
leftovers again,

806
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,560
-Did it work?
-Maeve was born nine months,,,

807
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:04,160
,,,and one day later,

808
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:10,080
l don't wanna just do random dating,
Carol, l wanna be in love,

809
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:12,800
l wanna wake up next to someone
and see them smile,

810
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:16,200
Do the whole Sunday breakfast thing,
go out and get the paper,

811
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:19,040
Stay in bed together all day,

812
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,440
Wouldn't we all?

813
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:32,320
Man, this is absolutely gorgeous, l love
this, l can't believe you built it yourself,

814
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,400
Yeah, handcrafted, Hand-carved,

815
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:36,880
l hope you'll find
that it's more than a boat,

816
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,360
lt's a time machine,

817
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:40,920
-l love it, l want it, l'll take it,
-Great,

818
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:42,920
Did you race a lot in college?

819
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:46,240
l don't plan to race it,
Could you cut it in half for me?

820
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:49,200
-Excuse me?
-Yeah, cut it in half lengthwise,

821
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:51,960
l think it would be easier
to mount on the wall that way,

822
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:53,520
You want to mount the boat?

823
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:57,280
Yeah, l thought l'd put it in the den,
lt'd look great above my big screen,

824
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:01,120
You know, l think maybe you should go
to lKEA and buy a canoe,

825
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:03,760
lt's not for sale in that way,

826
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,040
-He's kidding, right?
-Wouldn't that be nice,

827
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:08,200
l've had this dream
that it'll end up wet,

828
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:11,760
lt's just not for sale in that way
at this time, Ever, really,

829
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:14,800
Okay, Well, if you change your mind,
l really do want it,

830
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:18,040
Yeah, if l change my personality,
l'll let you know what l become,

831
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:20,720
-Okay,
-Thanks so much,

832
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,000
-Nice guy,
-Stanley owes me a big favor,

833
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:25,080
-lt was a guaranteed sale,
-So what?

834
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:27,360
Right, You can afford to be picky,
You sold,,,

835
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:29,640
,,,let's see, no boats, No boats at all,

836
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:32,760
You worry too much,
You really do,

837
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:35,800
You're in a good mood,
That must have been some date,

838
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,840
Charlie, you should have
seen this girl,

839
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:41,960
She's shy, she's fragile,
she's self-conscious,

840
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:47,040
She has no idea how beautiful she is,
She's a mess, lt's fantastic,

841
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:50,840
The evening didn't end up great,
but there were moments in there,,,

842
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:53,400
,,,where we were completely
and utterly ourselves,

843
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:56,520
l was completely psychotic,
but she was completely lovely,

844
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,680
Are you thinking about completely
closing the sale any time soon?

845
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:02,280
l tell you about a night
with an unusual woman,,,

846
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:04,600
,,,and you turn it
into a business transaction,

847
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:06,520
We're not selling real estate here,

848
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:09,960
-And if we were selling real estate?
-We'd be in escrow this weekend,

849
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:21,720
l see Dad's not alone,

850
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:23,800
Never, Not our dad,

851
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:34,800
