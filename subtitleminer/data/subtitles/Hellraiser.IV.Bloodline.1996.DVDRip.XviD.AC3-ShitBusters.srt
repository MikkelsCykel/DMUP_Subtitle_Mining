6
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,620
<i>for such a short game.</i>

7
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:05,180

8
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,700
<i>And it's time...</i>

9
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:11,260
<i>for revenge.</i>

10
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:19,700
<i>Dr. Merchant,</i>
<i>consider yourself relieved.</i>

11
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:23,340
<i>What else, Chamberlain?</i>

12
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:26,820
He's rerouted all available power
to his personal quarters...

13
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:30,380
and he's shut down
most of the ship.

14
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,940
I want you to check everything out
and find out why.

15
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,860
Yes, sir.

16
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:38,900
So, we have the company's
most productive space station...

17
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:42,060
hijacked and taken out of orbit
by the man who built it.

18
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:45,100
We have the man himself
immersed in ancient history,

19
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:47,820
<i>letting the whole place</i>
<i>go to shit.</i>

20
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:50,540
<i>- Evaluation?</i>
- Wacko.

21
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:53,060
<i>I wasn't asking you, Carducci.</i>
<i>I was asking the expert.</i>

22
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,940
<i>Well, Rimmer?</i>

23
00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:00,260
Great man didn't live up
to your expectations, did he?

24
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:04,900
I'm sure he will, sir, as soon as I
can begin my interrogation.

25
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,420
Where's your crew?

26
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:15,020
<i>I made them leave. They're headed for</i>
<i>Earth. Look, time is of the essence.</i>

27
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:18,060
Was there some
technical problem?

28
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:20,220
No. Yes.
Yes, that's it.

29
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,380
There's been a technical
problem, and you...

30
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:25,460
all of you have to get the fuck
off this station right now.

31
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:29,900
- When we go, you come with us.
- No, you don't understand.

32
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,900
Help me, then.

33
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:35,420
What's your name?

34
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,460
Rimmer.

35
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,580
I'm playing the endgame
here, Rimmer,

36
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,740
finishing something
that began centuries ago,

37
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,460
and I don't have the time
to help you understand.

38
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:47,740
<i>You don't know</i>
<i>what you're playing with.</i>

39
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,060
What are you afraid of?

40
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,700
Whatever it is,
it's here...

41
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,940
in this station.

42
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:59,500
That and things your little
rational mind couldn't even dream of.

43
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,460
But I dream.

44
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,060
Oh, I dream.

45
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:09,020
<i>Parker was right.</i>
<i>You are crazy.</i>

46
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,020
<i>I built this place</i>
<i>for a reason:</i>

47
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:14,100
To create the biggest trap
in the galaxy.

48
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:17,500
<i>- What did you expect to catch?</i>
- Hell is what I'm going to catch.

49
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:20,220
And I'm going to burn it away
in a blaze of light.

50
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,580
You're serious,
aren't you?

51
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:27,140
If I tell you
the whole story,

52
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,700
<i>will you let me finish</i>
<i>what I began?</i>

53
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:36,820
<i>Centuries ago,</i>
<i>a man, an ancestor of mine,</i>

54
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,980
Phillip L'Merchant,

55
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:42,340
<i>built a puzzle box,</i>
<i>the first box,</i>

56
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,260
<i>his finest work.</i>

57
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,820
<i>Commissioned by a wealthy</i>
<i>aristocrat named De L 'Isle,</i>

58
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:51,300
<i>a man obsessed</i>
<i>with black magic,</i>

59
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:53,540
<i>a leader of the occult.</i>

60
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:56,260
<i>Phillip was so proud</i>
<i>of his work,</i>

61
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,980
<i>a work that would</i>
<i>establish his name,</i>

62
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:02,700
<i>his family... my family.</i>

63
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:06,140
<i>He didn't know the great power</i>
<i>the box held...</i>

64
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:09,300
<i>and the unspeakable things</i>
<i>it would release...</i>

65
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,300
<i>the evil,</i>

66
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:14,060
<i>the sins,</i>

67
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,940
<i>the pain.</i>

68
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:22,980
- Is it done?
- Done.

69
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:26,260
<i>- Is it wonderful?</i>
- Wonderful.

70
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,180
Are you brilliant?

71
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:32,380
The finest toy maker in France.

72
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,980
Oh, what does it do?

73
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:01,660
<i>Oh. It doesn't</i>
<i>actually do anything.</i>

74
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,780
It's my masterpiece.

75
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,380
You simply
couldn't understand.

76
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:11,140
I was working to a commission
to a very specific request.

77
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,380
<i>It's almost midnight.</i>
<i>Where are you going?</i>

78
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:18,020
- The Chateau De L'Isle, to deliver the box.
- Now? Why?

79
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,660
Because my work might be
appreciated there.

80
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:28,540
It's late.
Stay with me.

81
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,020
Stay with us.

82
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:38,340
I must go.

83
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:41,300
My son will be born
in a better place than this.

84
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,540
This is only the beginning.

85
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,460
I can feel it.

86
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:18,180
All alone in this
dark, dark world.

87
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:21,700
<i>No home, no family.</i>

88
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,980
Not even christened,
I understand.

89
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,540
<i>Jacques,</i>

90
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,980
<i>show this child</i>
<i>to a chair.</i>

91
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,580
Enjoy.

92
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:53,300
Careful!

93
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:57,620
I'd be mortified if you
sliced your little finger.

94
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,580
Such a gentleman.

95
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:05,300
<i>Are you always</i>
<i>such a gentleman?</i>

96
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:07,620
No.

97
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,540
Not always.

98
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:18,540
<i>Monsieur De L 'Isle is</i>
<i>France's greatest magician.</i>

99
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:39,140
- What is this?
- So you don't bruise.

100
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:09,500
<i>Easy, Jacques.</i>
<i>Keep the pressure steady.</i>

101
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,300
She has spirit.
Splendid.

102
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:28,340
Now we can begin.

103
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:56,300
Ahh, L'Merchant.

104
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,860
As precise as your pieces.

105
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:02,100
As timely as your toys.

106
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:04,900
<i>And where is the box?</i>

107
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:08,660
<i>Pay him, Jacques.</i>

108
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:12,660
Thank you.

109
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,820
<i>Good night, toy maker.</i>

110
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:34,580
Take her in
to the laboratory.

111
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,980
<i>Find the right instrument.</i>

112
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:43,540
<i>We must make a clean...</i>
<i>incision...</i>

113
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:54,500
<i>so that we can</i>
<i>remove the innards...</i>

114
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,940
<i>so we can replace</i>
<i>the flesh again.</i>

115
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:02,540
<i>Yes, the gizzard.</i>

116
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,860
We'll scrub this.

117
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:23,900
<i>Now we can raise her up</i>
<i>off the ground.</i>

118
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,780
<i>That's it.</i>

119
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:49,740
<i>Walk now amongst us!</i>

120
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:07,060
<i>- My God.</i>
<i>- Fear not, Jacques.</i>

121
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,820
Remember your lessons.

122
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:14,180
A summoned demon
is yours to command.

123
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:16,860
<i>Unless you stand</i>
<i>in hell's way.</i>

124
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:20,180
Yes.

125
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:27,380
He who summons the magic...

126
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:30,180
<i>commands the magic.</i>

127
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:36,420
<i>You are...</i>

128
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,340
<i>Angelique.</i>

129
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,260
<i>He who summons the magic...</i>

130
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:46,420
Commands the magic.

131
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:53,540
<i>'Tis no story, Auguste.</i>

132
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:57,260
<i>I saw what I saw,</i>
<i>heard what I heard.</i>

133
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,580
<i>The box opens</i>
<i>the doors to hell.</i>

134
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:04,020
This is the 18th century,
Phillip, not the dark ages.

135
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,300
<i>The world is ruled</i>
<i>by reason.</i>

136
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,940
We even got rid of God.

137
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:12,420
And if there is no heaven,
then it follows reasonably...

138
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,260
that there is no hell.

139
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:17,420
I was at its very window
last night!

140
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:21,900
Very well.
Suppose, for the sake of argument,

141
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:25,580
<i>that what you fear happened</i>
<i>has happened.</i>

142
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:29,780
A box that can open the gates of hell
must be able to close them.

143
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:32,700
The box belongs to people with
little interest in closing such doors.

144
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:36,820
Well, then the solution
lies literally in your hands.

145
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:40,980
You've designed a machine
that you fear can bring forth demons.

146
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:44,700
- Yes.
- Then design a machine that can destroy them.

147
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,820
<i>Phillip had the design.</i>

148
00:18:55,900 --> 00:19:00,300
<i>That design.</i>
<i>It seemed an impossible task.</i>

149
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:03,380
But he had to try,
try something.

150
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:06,740
And his only hope
was to steal the box,

151
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:11,060
the puzzle box that he had created
with his own hands.

152
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,780
<i>Unbutton my shirt.</i>
<i>Yes.</i>

153
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,180
<i>Turn around.</i>

154
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,460
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

155
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:09,180
<i>Toy maker, you have</i>
<i>such pliant fingers.</i>

156
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,100
<i>I want them</i>
<i>to play with me.</i>

157
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,820
And take my soul?

158
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:25,340
It's already gone, toy maker.

159
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:28,660
<i>Demons will walk the Earth,</i>

160
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:31,180
and you're responsible.

161
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,580
Think of that.

162
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:38,860
You and your bloodline cursed 'til the end
of time because of your little puzzle box.

163
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:43,020
What are you waiting for? Kill him
and come back where you belong.

164
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:59,100
Such pliant fingers.

165
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:33,140
My God!

166
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:36,580
Please forgive me.

167
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,780
I didn't know
what I was doing.

168
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:41,420
We've got to
get you out of here.

169
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,020
It's too late.

170
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:48,780
<i>They're back. Save yourself.</i>

171
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:52,140
Save the child.

172
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,860
Jacques was right.

173
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:08,100
Demons did walk the Earth,

174
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:10,660
the same way they're walking
this station right now.

175
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:13,460
From a puzzle box?

176
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:16,180
Angelique had many boxes
made from his design,

177
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:18,500
<i>but it wasn't enough.</i>

178
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:21,260
<i>She wanted a box that</i>
<i>would open the gateway forever.</i>

179
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:24,220
- And your family?
<i>- Was the key.</i>

180
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,980
But they treated it
the same way you treat it.

181
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:30,300
Like a fairy tale.
But their blood remembered.

182
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:34,180
<i>And as the generations</i>
<i>passed,</i>

183
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:37,020
there were Merchants
who dreamed of puzzle boxes...

184
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:39,300
and doors leading to hell.

185
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:43,420
And then one of them
met... Angelique...

186
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,820
much, much later.

187
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:51,380
Even in sleep,
you want me.

188
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,820
Even in dreams,
you watch me.

189
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:57,260
Yes, I know.

190
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:59,540
I know what's
in your heart.

191
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:10,380
John Merchant.

192
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:13,460
Look at me, look at me, look at me.

193
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:15,700
Are you okay?

194
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:18,740
Oh, God, I woke Jack again.

195
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:23,700
<i>Mommy! Mommy!</i>

196
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,780
You look terrible.

197
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:34,540
I'm worried, and I really think
you should see someone.

198
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:36,940
You know I've been
having these dreams all my life.

199
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:40,020
John, honey,
they're getting worse.

200
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:43,940
It is your goddamned grandmother.
She was weird, John.

201
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:48,660
You remember those stories about how, how
important you are and how important the family is?

202
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:51,380
Honey, she put stuff
in your mind.

203
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:54,380
Not all of it.
There are other things.

204
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:57,220
Things that feel
like memories,

205
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,620
impossible memories.

206
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:03,500
And they just don't haunt my dreams,
they haunt my work.

207
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:07,180
<i>- Everything that I've done...</i>
- I don't want you haunted, and I don't want you hurt.

208
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,940
It's not that.
It's... It's stress.

209
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:13,540
<i>It's this this banquet thing.</i>
<i>I hate crap like this!</i>

210
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,940
Oh.
Then you shouldn't be so good.

211
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:20,620
<i>- But it's not ready. I'm not sure if it will work.</i>
- Right.

212
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,340
<i>So that's why your face</i>
<i>is on this magazine cover.</i>

213
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:32,180
L'Merchant!

214
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:34,980
The bloodline continues,
toy maker.

215
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:38,980
I'm restless,
and you're bored.

216
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,740
I think we should
see America.

217
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:45,180
Screw America.

218
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:48,180
Then I would like your permission
to go by myself.

219
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:55,940
Don't you want to know
why I'd like to go?

220
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:01,540
<i>Is that your final word?</i>

221
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:44,620
Angelique,
let's make this clear.

222
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,260
What you want
is irrelevant.

223
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:50,140
It's about what I want.

224
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:53,860
After 200 years, you should know
what those things are.

225
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:58,500
Jacques,

226
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:00,940
have I ever
disappointed you?

227
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:04,660
- No.
- Close your eyes.

228
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:07,500
- Don't move.
- Why?

229
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:12,940
So you won't bruise.

230
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:16,380
- Is this a new game?
- Oh, yes.

231
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:19,660
<i>It might hurt...</i>

232
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:25,700
Just a little.

233
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:33,220
<i>Jacques, do you remember</i>
<i>De L 'Isle's lesson?</i>

234
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,180
Perhaps I was a bit hasty.

235
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:44,300
Enjoy.

236
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:49,820
<i>I forget.</i>
<i>You like it rough, don't you?</i>

237
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:52,980
<i>Please!</i>

238
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:56,380
Yes, you like it rough!

239
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:19,540
<i>It hurts.</i>

240
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:22,220
It hurts.

241
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:28,060
Oh, please. Please.

242
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:35,340
You broke the number-one rule, Jacques.

243
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,260
You tried to stand
in hell's way.

244
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,460
What are you talking about?

245
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:43,300
The toy maker's bloodline
has survived.

246
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:49,420
The box.

247
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,380
America.

248
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:43,020
<i>It's both</i>
<i>my pleasure and honor...</i>

249
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:46,020
to present this award on behalf
of the architectural community...

250
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:48,660
to Mr. John Merchant.

251
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,580
John.

252
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,820
Thank you.

253
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:00,020
I've always thought
that the...

254
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:02,540
applause from your peers
is the best kind of applause,

255
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:06,220
and I am truly touched
by, uh, your reception...

256
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,460
and by this award.

257
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,460
Originally,
when I had put myself...

258
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:30,620
Leonardo da Vinci
once said that no work of art...

259
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,660
is ever completed,

260
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:34,620
only abandoned.

261
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:37,700
And I never understood
what he meant until now.

262
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:46,220
Thank you.
Good night.

263
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:49,500
Very nice speech.

264
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:56,420
<i>Honey, it's okay.</i>
<i>Let's just go.</i>

265
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:02,180
<i>Toy maker.</i>

266
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:05,300
<i>I know I brought it with me.</i>

267
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,740
- Idiot!
- I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.

268
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:19,300
- I didn't even see you.
- Oh, forgive me.

269
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:21,900
- I'm very sorry.
- That was very rude.

270
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:28,180
Now I'll have to think of a way
to make it up to you.

271
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:37,620
<i>Why are we going to the basement?</i>
<i>At least tell me your name.</i>

272
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:40,460
Do we really need to know
each other's names?

273
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:43,100
Mystery woman, huh?

274
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:45,780
Aren't you excited
by mystery?

275
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:48,540
Ooh, yeah. You bet.

276
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:52,580
You seem to be pretty
familiar with this place.

277
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:55,780
I'm just following
my instincts.

278
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:04,340
Do you like games?

279
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:07,580
You're a dream.

280
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:11,100
Almost.

281
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:28,340
<i>Close your eyes.</i>
<i>Trust me.</i>

282
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:30,260
Okay.

283
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:48,660
What's going on?

284
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:54,540
Can I look now?

285
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:56,500
<i>You can look now.</i>

286
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:03,020
Time to play another game.

287
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:13,900
I have such sights
to show you.

288
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:17,460
All right.

289
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:15,700
What's happening?

290
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:00,020
Angelique.

291
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:16,020
Things seem to have changed.

292
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:21,620
Hell is more ordered
since your time, Princess.

293
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:24,940
And much less amusing.

294
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:31,780
<i>- The box did this?</i>
<i>- A man did this.</i>

295
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:36,420
But the box called him.
It called to his blood.

296
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:38,340
His ancestor made the box...

297
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:41,620
<i>and would have unmade</i>
<i>all of us.</i>

298
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:44,900
You've been away too long,
Princess.

299
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:47,940
This is not a room.

300
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:51,220
This is a holocaust...

301
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:54,500
waiting to wake itself.

302
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:00,780
If we could just move
this whole thing right up...

303
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,860
to give it
a little more height.

304
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:05,340
- There's a woman here to see you.
- Tell her to have a seat, okay?

305
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:08,500
- Okay.
<i>- John Merchant and Associates.</i>

306
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,900
I know you.

307
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:20,100
You've no idea what a pleasure
it is to meet you again.

308
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:25,500
This is all very good.

309
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:28,860
You're the one
we've been waiting for.

310
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:31,580
Who are you?

311
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:33,980
A friend, I hope.

312
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,980
A client, I'm sure.

313
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:49,020
Is this yours?

314
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,940
No.

315
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:58,420
This has been in my family
for hundreds of years.

316
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:01,100
<i>I'm working on something</i>
<i>based on it.</i>

317
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:03,420
- May I see it?
- Nobody's seen it.

318
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:06,860
Then let me be the first.

319
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:11,380
<i>To put it simply, it's something</i>
<i>I want to do with mirrors and lasers.</i>

320
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:15,620
See, in theory, it's possible.

321
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:18,900
Perpetual light.

322
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:21,940
<i>Trapped light feeding off</i>
<i>its own reflections.</i>

323
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,380
<i>I haven't perfected</i>
<i>the light yet.</i>

324
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:30,100
<i>Something's missing,</i>
<i>and I can't make it work.</i>

325
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:32,460
<i>It'll go for a few seconds...</i>

326
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:34,860
then it'll blink out.

327
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:41,020
<i>Sometimes a few seconds</i>
<i>are more than enough,</i>

328
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,940
<i>toy maker.</i>

329
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:47,420
What did you call me?

330
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:52,580
You think you don't remember,
but your blood knows.

331
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:54,460
Let it remind you.

332
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:00,300
- Angelique.
- You know me from dreams.

333
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:03,180
John Merchant.
John L'Merchant.

334
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:08,540
We have a destiny...

335
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:10,460
together.

336
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:13,860
I don't believe in destiny.

337
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:18,020
You think your work
on the building was an accident?

338
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:20,020
It called to you, John.

339
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:24,060
We have great work to do.

340
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:25,980
I shall be in touch.

341
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:12,620
Whatever you want.
Whatever you want.

342
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:22,900
What time is it?

343
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:28,900
- Hello.
- L'Merchant.

344
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:31,420
I have to see you.

345
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,380
<i>- Can we meet? Today.</i>
<i>- Yeah. Okay.</i>

346
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:35,700
<i>- We'll go over it tomorrow.</i>
- At your office.

347
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:38,740
Okay. Bye.

348
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:40,900
Business.

349
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:43,580
Some Japanese client.
Got no sense of time.

350
00:39:56,340 --> 00:40:00,380
I grow impatient
with the Princess.

351
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:05,100
Human acquiescence is as easily
obtained by terror...

352
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:07,300
as by temptation.

353
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:21,420
- New building.
- Must be.

354
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:24,540
- Settling?
- Yeah. Settling.

355
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:27,540
Still hungry?

356
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:32,060
Ready for something that screams?

357
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:36,500
<i>So she starts</i>
<i>asking me all kinds of weird questions.</i>

358
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:38,580
<i>Like what?</i>

359
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:41,940
Like, would I do it with a woman
that used to be a man?

360
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:44,620
- Like with a guy that had it cut off?
- Yeah.

361
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:47,420
Hormones, the whole bit.

362
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:50,380
- So, what'd you say?
- I mean, I guess so.

363
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:52,700
If she was cut
and all.

364
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:58,980
- What's this?
- It's a door.

365
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:02,260
<i>I know it's a door,</i>
<i>but it isn't on the chart.</i>

366
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:05,460
Genius college boys.

367
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:47,300
A pity the mirror will not
show your true beauty, Princess.

368
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:51,620
Your human admirer
may not sense it,

369
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:56,740
but I can smell
the exquisite stench...

370
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:59,220
of what you really are!

371
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:02,660
<i>You know, I'm starting</i>
<i>not to like this so much.</i>

372
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:05,820
- You know, I was just thinking the same thing.
- Well, maybe...

373
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,780
Shit!

374
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:17,620
<i>- We should check it out.</i>
- Speak for yourself.

375
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:22,980
This is getting weird.

376
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:24,900
You coming?

377
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:27,620
<i>Go ahead.</i>
<i>Check it out.</i>

378
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:29,540
Well, at least
watch my back.

379
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:31,460
You got it.

380
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:48,220
You look like death, Princess.

381
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:01,500
Temptation is illusion.

382
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:04,460
But the time for trickery
is past.

383
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:08,060
In this game, we show ourselves
as we really are.

384
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:11,420
What's that?

385
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:13,540
The beauty of suffering.

386
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:18,700
You are no different
from that beast...

387
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:21,780
that sucks the bones
you throw to it.

388
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:26,700
And you, Princess.

389
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:28,980
What are you?

390
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:09,500
You scared the shit out
of me, man! What's wrong with you?

391
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:11,660
My flashlight died.
I tripped and fell.

392
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:13,860
<i>From now on,</i>
<i>we stick together. Always.</i>

393
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:16,420
Together. Right.

394
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:33,580
Someone's messing
with our heads.

395
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:42,820
<i>Freeze!</i>

396
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:46,780
- Just back it up against the wall!
- You heard him. Back it up!

397
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:48,740
Don't make us
put some pain on you.

398
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:51,420
Pain?

399
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:54,300
How dare you use that word.

400
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:56,660
He's got pins
in his head.

401
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:59,540
What you think of
as pain...

402
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:02,420
is only a shadow.

403
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:05,340
Pain has a face.

404
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:10,260
Allow me to show it to you.

405
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:13,380
<i>Gentlemen,</i>

406
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:17,380
I... am... pain.

407
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:24,660
I know your fear.

408
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:26,580
I hear it.

409
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:32,460
"Please, don't separate me
from my brother. "

410
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:36,500
<i>I give you my word...</i>

411
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:38,420
<i>that will never happen.</i>

412
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:43,220
A lesson, Princess.

413
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:47,220
<i>Work with me,</i>
<i>or for me.</i>

414
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:04,380
Temptation is worthless,
Princess.

415
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:07,380
<i>Suffering is the coin</i>
<i>of the realm.</i>

416
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:11,540
I will teach your human Merchant
about the value of suffering.

417
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:13,980
I will buy his secret...

418
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:16,500
with a bounty of pain.

419
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:20,860
<i>They say</i>
<i>the greatest suffering...</i>

420
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:23,060
a parent can know...

421
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:27,780
is the loss of a child.

422
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:41,940
Honey, Mommy'll be back
in five minutes, okay?

423
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:47,380
- Jack.
- Mom, I'm concentrating.

424
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:57,700
<i>- I don't know what I'm doing here.</i>
<i>- I had to see you.</i>

425
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:03,540
Whatever you want.

426
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:09,940
We were good together, John.

427
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:13,380
Yes.

428
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:17,300
We will be again.

429
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:14,980
<i>Mommy!</i>

430
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:35,620
<i>Oh, God!</i>

431
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:38,780
Oh, thank God!

432
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:41,980
<i>- Jack, honey, baby, come here.</i>
- I can't, Mommy.

433
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:44,580
He won't let me.

434
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:48,940
<i>What, baby?</i>

435
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:51,220
<i>- Mom.</i>
- Oh, God.

436
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:54,540
Young... unformed.

437
00:49:57,460 --> 00:50:00,340
Oh, what appetites
I could teach him.

438
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:03,740
Just give him to me, please!

439
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:06,540
Oh, you suffer beautifully.

440
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:09,900
But I am here for business,
not pleasure.

441
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:13,340
- Just tell me what you want.
- Oh, I want bait.

442
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:18,300
Live bait.

443
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:27,620
Bobbi! Jack!
Bobbi!

444
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:02,260
You stay here.

445
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:16,740
<i>Oh, thank God.</i>

446
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:18,940
John, don't!

447
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:23,140
<i>Easy.</i>

448
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:31,420
I don't know who
or what you are...

449
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:33,660
and I don't care.

450
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:36,540
I just want my wife
and my kid back!

451
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:39,140
Oh, I understand...

452
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:42,100
how you love this boy.

453
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:45,140
<i>You have plans for him.</i>

454
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:47,580
<i>Hopes and dreams.</i>

455
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:50,580
A whole imagined future...

456
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:53,860
where you love him
and watch him grow.

457
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:57,420
- Yes.
- Then complete your work.

458
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:00,820
<i>Or, though the boy</i>
<i>will not die here,</i>

459
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:04,940
for a thousand years his dearest wish
will be that he had!

460
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:06,420
For God's sake!

461
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:10,180
Do I look like someone
who cares what God thinks?

462
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:13,780
Just tell me what you want.

463
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:19,860
The box.

464
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:23,900
<i>Apathway to hell...</i>

465
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:28,300
made by
an ancestor of yours.

466
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:32,180
The room downstairs...

467
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:35,740
potentially
a bigger pathway.

468
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:41,780
You will help...

469
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:44,740
to fulfill its promise.

470
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:20,180
Come on!

471
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:28,420
Come on, Jack.

472
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:30,340
This way.
Come on!

473
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:33,060
- We're gonna split up. Take the other stairwell.
- What?

474
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:36,940
I've got a plan. Jack, it'll be okay.
All right? You can do it.

475
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:46,860
Come on, you bastard.
It's me you want.

476
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:49,180
<i>Don't flatter yourself.</i>

477
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:53,980
I don't want you, child.
I want what you were born with: A gift.

478
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:56,380
The lights.

479
00:54:56,460 --> 00:55:00,740
<i>Oh, no. Not light.</i>
<i>Darkness is where you find me.</i>

480
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:09,020
<i>Good.</i>
<i>Stand your ground.</i>

481
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:11,540
Family man.

482
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:16,860
The box,

483
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:19,340
once thought so powerful,

484
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:21,260
is only a model.

485
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:25,620
<i>What you will give me</i>
<i>is the true version.</i>

486
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:28,540
No longer will we have to
seep into your world...

487
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:31,460
like pests through cracks
in the baseboards.

488
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:34,540
Once and for all,
we will open the gates,

489
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:36,580
lay low the ramparts.

490
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:40,340
<i>Isn't that what the Princess</i>
<i>wants from you?</i>

491
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:43,980
Isn't that the game
that you two have been playing?

492
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:47,220
- This isn't a game.
- Oh, yes.

493
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:50,340
<i>This is a game.</i>

494
00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:54,340
And now it is time...

495
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:56,220
to play.

496
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:00,540
I shall go first.

497
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:06,820
Daddy!

498
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:10,340
<i>Run!</i>

499
00:56:10,420 --> 00:56:15,820
It is time to open
the pathway... forever.

500
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:22,380
<i>That's impossible!</i>

501
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:35,700
No. No!

502
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:04,020
Does this pathway
work both ways?

503
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:11,980
<i>Toy maker.</i>

504
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:14,100
Come here, Jack!

505
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:18,740
So young.

506
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:22,100
So tender.

507
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:24,220
- So ripe.
<i>- Daddy!</i>

508
00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:28,260
- Get your hands off of him!
- Get your hands on the console, toy maker.

509
00:57:28,340 --> 00:57:31,260
<i>You have work to do.</i>

510
00:57:37,340 --> 00:57:40,180
<i>Open the pathway for me!</i>

511
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:49,860
The toy maker's design.

512
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:03,660
Do it!

513
00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:17,260
- Jack!
- Daddy!

514
00:58:26,180 --> 00:58:30,100
- Run, Jack!
- No more games.

515
00:58:50,780 --> 00:58:53,140
- Jack!
- Mommy!

516
00:58:53,180 --> 00:58:56,500
You go play with your dog,
you bastard!

517
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:35,660
The boy lived.

518
00:59:35,740 --> 00:59:37,700
He carried
the bloodline,

519
00:59:37,780 --> 00:59:41,140
the guilt for what
our family had begun.

520
00:59:41,220 --> 00:59:44,380
And how to undo it.
Did he carry that too?

521
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:48,460
Yes. It was passed down
through the generations.

522
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:53,740
It came upon me first
in my dreams.

523
00:59:53,820 --> 00:59:56,380
My blood was speaking to me
while I slept,

524
00:59:56,420 --> 00:59:59,340
telling me to make good the damage
L'Merchant had done...

525
00:59:59,420 --> 01:00:02,260
all those centuries ago.

526
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:05,340
Dr. Merchant,
what were you doing...

527
01:00:05,420 --> 01:00:09,020
when Parker and I found you
in your cabin?

528
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:12,780
<i>Summoning a demon</i>
<i>or two.</i>

529
01:00:12,820 --> 01:00:14,700
Maybe more.

530
01:00:14,740 --> 01:00:18,180
- And did you succeed?
<i>- Oh, yes.</i>

531
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:21,420
It was much easier
than I thought.

532
01:01:11,380 --> 01:01:13,780
Merchant, do you hear me?

533
01:01:17,180 --> 01:01:19,060
I know you're watching.

534
01:01:23,860 --> 01:01:27,260
We'd almost given up
waiting for you to play.

535
01:01:27,340 --> 01:01:30,020
Long wait, demon,

536
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:31,940
for such a short game.

537
01:01:32,020 --> 01:01:35,340
Short? Ohh.

538
01:01:35,420 --> 01:01:39,060
Is that any way to treat
an old friend of the family?

539
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:43,540
<i>No. Tell the truth,</i>
<i>Merchant.</i>

540
01:01:43,620 --> 01:01:46,500
You're pleased to see me.

541
01:01:46,540 --> 01:01:48,660
Your impatience...

542
01:01:48,740 --> 01:01:50,820
has matched my own.

543
01:01:50,860 --> 01:01:52,820
Perhaps.

544
01:01:55,340 --> 01:01:59,220
But now curiosity
is satisfied.

545
01:01:59,300 --> 01:02:01,100
<i>And it's time for revenge.</i>

546
01:02:01,180 --> 01:02:04,460
<i>Dr. Merchant,</i>
<i>consider yourself relieved.</i>

547
01:02:04,540 --> 01:02:06,980
Not now.
I let them out!

548
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:10,980
What's wrong with this
is I don't believe in hell.

549
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:14,220
<i>But it believes in you,</i>
<i>and it's out there right now.</i>

550
01:02:16,860 --> 01:02:18,700
I don't frighten easily.

551
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:22,020
<i>Well, stop thinking</i>
<i>and start feeling!</i>

552
01:02:22,060 --> 01:02:24,940
Your gut knows that I'm
telling you the truth.

553
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:29,100
There's something in this station
right now that wants our souls.

554
01:02:29,180 --> 01:02:32,460
And whether you believe in hell or not,
it's gonna take us there.

555
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:36,500
<i>Solar alignment in place.</i>

556
01:02:36,580 --> 01:02:39,020
- Twenty-three minutes to
complete mission. -

557
01:02:39,100 --> 01:02:42,740
Please...
get off this station.

558
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:45,540
Let me save
at least one soul.

559
01:02:45,620 --> 01:02:47,740
We go together,
or we don't go at all.

560
01:02:47,780 --> 01:02:51,180
Then we go together.
Just let me finish.

561
01:02:53,180 --> 01:02:56,740
Rimmer, we're pulling out as soon as
Parker finishes checking Merchant's cabin.

562
01:02:56,780 --> 01:03:00,660
Get him out of there now.
You don't know what they're capable of!

563
01:03:00,740 --> 01:03:05,380
Rimmer, escort the prisoner to his cell
and prepare to leave at 04:30 hours.

564
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:11,340
What the...

565
01:03:16,180 --> 01:03:19,020
<i>Help! Help!</i>

566
01:03:19,060 --> 01:03:23,260
<i>- Save me! Hurry!</i>
- My God!

567
01:03:23,340 --> 01:03:25,700
<i>- We're trapped!</i>
<i>- Hurry!</i>

568
01:03:28,380 --> 01:03:31,660
<i>Help!</i>
<i>Get us out of here!</i>

569
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:35,180
<i>Hurry!</i>

570
01:03:35,220 --> 01:03:37,100
<i>In here!</i>

571
01:04:05,820 --> 01:04:07,660
<i>What the hell is this?</i>

572
01:04:07,740 --> 01:04:11,900
<i>The remnants of a most</i>
<i>unsatisfying victim.</i>

573
01:04:11,980 --> 01:04:14,580
<i>Still...</i>

574
01:04:14,660 --> 01:04:16,820
you're here
to change all that.

575
01:04:18,420 --> 01:04:20,420
<i>Aren't you?</i>

576
01:04:47,380 --> 01:04:49,380
<i>Merchant has a plan.</i>

577
01:04:50,740 --> 01:04:52,860
Kill them all.

578
01:04:54,620 --> 01:04:57,260
I keep trying to raise Parker.
He's not responding.

579
01:04:57,340 --> 01:04:59,500
- I'm going to go check it out.
- He's dead!

580
01:04:59,580 --> 01:05:03,020
And if you don't let me out to finish
my work, you're all dead!

581
01:05:33,140 --> 01:05:34,980
Chamberlain.

582
01:05:35,020 --> 01:05:38,420
Parker's dead.

583
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:41,380
- What?
<i>- Parker's dead.</i>

584
01:05:41,460 --> 01:05:45,300
Oh, God.

585
01:05:45,340 --> 01:05:49,140
Don't know what the hell's
going on.

586
01:05:49,180 --> 01:05:51,980
Just remember:
Shoot first.

587
01:05:52,060 --> 01:05:53,900
<i>Out.</i>

588
01:06:28,220 --> 01:06:31,780
<i>Help me, please!</i>
<i>Please, help me!</i>

589
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:26,380
Please.

590
01:07:26,460 --> 01:07:29,300
Help me.

591
01:07:54,460 --> 01:07:56,940
<i>Mr. Chamberlain?</i>

592
01:07:57,980 --> 01:08:00,020
What the fuck planet
are you from?

593
01:08:00,100 --> 01:08:03,300
<i>Come on.</i>

594
01:09:10,740 --> 01:09:14,660
- Can you still do it? Can you stop them?
- I can try.

595
01:09:14,740 --> 01:09:17,060
I need a couple of minutes to get
the coordinates locked in from here.

596
01:09:17,140 --> 01:09:19,460
Give you a chance to get to the ship.
Go. Now!

597
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:23,460
<i>- We can't leave without Carducci.</i>
- Carducci, come in!

598
01:09:23,540 --> 01:09:25,980
I'm going after him.
Get to the ship.

599
01:09:26,060 --> 01:09:28,420
That weapon
will not protect you!

600
01:09:31,060 --> 01:09:33,900
But I know something
that will.

601
01:09:58,940 --> 01:10:00,820
Oh, no.

602
01:10:02,260 --> 01:10:04,100
He said it could protect me.

603
01:10:04,180 --> 01:10:06,060
<i>He told me what to do.</i>

604
01:10:06,140 --> 01:10:07,980
Please, go ahead.

605
01:10:12,380 --> 01:10:16,020
It's a box.

606
01:10:16,100 --> 01:10:17,940
<i>It's just a box.</i>

607
01:10:20,100 --> 01:10:23,100
Thank God
for men of reason.

608
01:10:27,060 --> 01:10:28,820
<i>Finish it.</i>

609
01:11:29,980 --> 01:11:33,620
<i>Now the final movement</i>
<i>begins.</i>

610
01:11:35,820 --> 01:11:39,140
Soon the bloodline
will be severed.

611
01:11:41,860 --> 01:11:45,540
You and your ancestors have
proved worthy opponents.

612
01:11:45,580 --> 01:11:47,620
The taste of victory...

613
01:11:47,700 --> 01:11:50,340
is almost bittersweet.

614
01:11:57,620 --> 01:12:00,180
<i>Glorious, is it not?</i>

615
01:12:00,260 --> 01:12:02,820
<i>Perfect.</i>

616
01:12:02,900 --> 01:12:05,820
The creatures that walk
on its surface,

617
01:12:05,900 --> 01:12:08,500
always looking
to the light,

618
01:12:08,540 --> 01:12:13,020
never seeing the untold oceans
of darkness beyond.

619
01:12:13,060 --> 01:12:17,260
<i>There are more humans alive</i>
<i>at this moment...</i>

620
01:12:17,340 --> 01:12:21,140
than in all
its pitiful history.

621
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:25,780
The Garden of Eden.

622
01:12:27,100 --> 01:12:30,820
A garden of flesh.

623
01:12:34,940 --> 01:12:37,940
<i>Nowhere to run this time,</i>
<i>toy maker.</i>

624
01:12:39,020 --> 01:12:40,860
No escape.

625
01:12:42,580 --> 01:12:45,140
Double back down this hallway
and get to the shuttle.

626
01:12:45,220 --> 01:12:48,780
- You've got five minutes, Rimmer.
- Together, you said.

627
01:12:48,860 --> 01:12:51,700
- I'm not done here.
- Well, then, I don't go.

628
01:12:51,780 --> 01:12:53,940
I'm coming right after you.

629
01:12:54,020 --> 01:12:56,140
Just be ready.

630
01:12:56,180 --> 01:12:59,580
We're not gonna have much time
once this thing goes.

631
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:02,740
Trust me.

632
01:13:02,820 --> 01:13:05,500
<i>I'm not going to sacrifice myself</i>
<i>if I can help it.</i>

633
01:13:05,540 --> 01:13:07,740
I'm not that crazy.

634
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:21,540
Oh, my God.

635
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:40,420
Here, doggie.

636
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:50,780
Play dead.

637
01:14:01,220 --> 01:14:05,500
<i>Dr. Merchant,</i>
<i>two minutes to complete mission.</i>

638
01:14:05,580 --> 01:14:10,100
Two minutes.
Two centuries.

639
01:14:10,180 --> 01:14:13,620
It all ticks by
so quickly.

640
01:14:14,780 --> 01:14:16,900
You are so very like
your ancestor.

641
01:14:16,980 --> 01:14:19,260
Did you know that?

642
01:14:19,340 --> 01:14:22,420
I have the distinct
sense of deja vu.

643
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:24,980
The same defiance,

644
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:28,900
the same faithless hope
in the light.

645
01:14:28,980 --> 01:14:32,060
- And what do you have faith in?
<i>- Nothing.</i>

646
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:36,860
I am so exquisitely empty.

647
01:14:41,980 --> 01:14:45,300
Then it won't hurt you
to die.

648
01:14:45,380 --> 01:14:47,620
Will it?

649
01:14:47,700 --> 01:14:50,340
I cannot die.

650
01:14:50,380 --> 01:14:53,820
I am forever.

651
01:14:57,380 --> 01:15:02,220
<i>Dr. Merchant,</i>
<i>one minute to complete mission.</i>

652
01:15:04,580 --> 01:15:06,940
Where are you,
toy maker?

653
01:15:08,620 --> 01:15:11,460
Here.

654
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:15,140
<i>Hologram. See, it's all done</i>
<i>with mirrors.</i>

655
01:15:15,220 --> 01:15:17,020
Like this.

656
01:15:25,900 --> 01:15:28,500
What have you done?

657
01:15:28,580 --> 01:15:30,780
I have faith in the light.

658
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:33,660
- What?
<i>- The light, demon. The light.</i>

659
01:15:38,220 --> 01:15:41,300
- Endgame, demon.
- No!

660
01:15:42,980 --> 01:15:45,220
I cannot die!

661
01:16:28,140 --> 01:16:30,140
<i>Welcome to oblivion.</i>

662
01:16:30:400 --> 01:16:32:500
Amen.

663
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:43,000
