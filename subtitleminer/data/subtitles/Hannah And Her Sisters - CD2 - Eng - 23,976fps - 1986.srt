1
00:00:20,402 --> 00:00:22,905
- You're late.
- Lucy and I kept talking.

2
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:25,575
I didn't realise how late it had got.

3
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:30,581
You missed a very dull
TV show about Auschwitz.

4
00:00:30,707 --> 00:00:34,962
More gruesome film clips,
and more puzzled intellectuals

5
00:00:35,087 --> 00:00:39,468
declaring their mystification over
the systematic murder of millions.

6
00:00:39,593 --> 00:00:43,723
The reason why they can never answer
the question "How could it happen?"

7
00:00:43,848 --> 00:00:45,768
is that it's the wrong question.

8
00:00:45,893 --> 00:00:49,815
Given what people are, the question is
"Why doesn't it happen more often?"

9
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:55,322
- Of course, it does, in subtler forms.
- I have a headache from this weather.

10
00:00:58,576 --> 00:01:01,788
It's been ages since
I sat in front of the TV,

11
00:01:01,914 --> 00:01:04,709
just changing channels to find something.

12
00:01:04,834 --> 00:01:07,170
You see the whole culture:

13
00:01:07,295 --> 00:01:09,548
Nazis, deodorant salesmen,

14
00:01:10,466 --> 00:01:13,762
wrestlers, beauty contests,
the talk show...

15
00:01:14,597 --> 00:01:18,518
Can you imagine the level of
a mind that watches wrestling?

16
00:01:18,643 --> 00:01:23,692
But the worst are the fundamentalist
preachers: third-rate con men

17
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:27,405
telling the poor suckers that watch them
that they speak for Jesus.

18
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:31,034
And to please send in money.
Money, money, money.

19
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:35,540
If Jesus came back and saw
what's going on in his name,

20
00:01:35,665 --> 00:01:39,796
- he'd never stop throwing up.
- Oh, God, would you please lighten up?

21
00:01:39,921 --> 00:01:44,469
I'm really not in the mood to hear
a review of contemporary society again.

22
00:01:45,637 --> 00:01:49,308
- You've been very nervous lately.
- I can't take this any more.

23
00:01:49,433 --> 00:01:52,437
I'm trying to complete an education
I started five years ago.

24
00:01:52,604 --> 00:01:55,149
I'm not your pupil. I was, but I'm not.

25
00:01:55,316 --> 00:01:58,737
When you leave the nest, I want you
to be ready to face the real world.

26
00:01:58,904 --> 00:02:01,115
We're going to have to
make some changes.

27
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,328
- Like what?
- You know what. I'm suffocating.

28
00:02:04,453 --> 00:02:09,125
- Are we having this conversation again?
- Yes, we are having it again.

29
00:02:09,292 --> 00:02:12,421
- I have to leave. I have to move out.
- Why?

30
00:02:12,588 --> 00:02:15,884
- Because I have to.
- What are you going to use for money?

31
00:02:16,009 --> 00:02:19,556
I don't know. I thought maybe I'd
move in with my parents for a while.

32
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:24,437
I always told you you would leave me.
Does it have to be now?

33
00:02:24,562 --> 00:02:27,900
Maybe it'll only be temporary,
but I have to try.

34
00:02:28,025 --> 00:02:31,112
Oh, Lee. You are my whole world.

35
00:02:34,867 --> 00:02:38,413
Good God. Have you been kissed tonight?

36
00:02:38,538 --> 00:02:40,916
- No.
- Oh, yes, you have.

37
00:02:41,042 --> 00:02:43,587
- You've been with someone!
- Stop accusing me!

38
00:02:43,712 --> 00:02:45,881
I'm too smart, Lee. You can't fool me!

39
00:02:46,006 --> 00:02:48,092
- You're turning all red.
- Leave me alone!

40
00:02:48,218 --> 00:02:50,679
Christ, what's wrong with you?

41
00:02:53,349 --> 00:02:56,228
- I'm sorry.
- Couldn't you say something?

42
00:02:56,353 --> 00:02:59,983
- You have to slither behind my back...
- I'm saying it now!

43
00:03:00,108 --> 00:03:02,152
So you met somebody else?

44
00:03:03,154 --> 00:03:04,155
Yeah.

45
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:08,494
But you knew it was going to happen
sooner or later. I can't live like this!

46
00:03:08,619 --> 00:03:11,915
- Who is it?
- What's the difference? Somebody I met.

47
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:16,296
- But who? Where did you meet him?
- It doesn't matter. I have to move out.

48
00:03:16,421 --> 00:03:18,882
You are my only connection to the world.

49
00:03:19,007 --> 00:03:23,054
Oh, God, that's too much
responsibility for me. It's not fair!

50
00:03:23,179 --> 00:03:26,100
I want a less complicated life.
I want a husband,

51
00:03:26,225 --> 00:03:30,439
- maybe even a child, before it's too late.
- Jesus! Jesus!

52
00:03:30,564 --> 00:03:33,443
Oh, God, I don't even know what I want.

53
00:03:36,488 --> 00:03:39,576
What do you get out of me,
anyway? I mean...

54
00:03:40,994 --> 00:03:43,289
It's not sexual any more.

55
00:03:44,373 --> 00:03:48,212
It's certainly not intellectual.
You're so superior to me in every way...

56
00:03:48,337 --> 00:03:50,381
Don't patronise me!

57
00:03:51,883 --> 00:03:57,349
God, I should have married you
years ago, when you wanted to.

58
00:03:57,474 --> 00:04:01,479
- I should have agreed.
- It never would have worked.

59
00:04:03,315 --> 00:04:07,445
I told you one day you would
leave me for a younger man. I...

60
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:22,005
What passion today with Lee!
She's a volcano.

61
00:04:23,215 --> 00:04:27,763
It was a totally fulfilling experience,
just as I'd dreamed it would be.

62
00:04:27,888 --> 00:04:32,477
That's what it was. It was like
living out a dream. A great dream.

63
00:04:33,562 --> 00:04:37,150
Now I feel very good and cosy
being here next to Hannah.

64
00:04:37,275 --> 00:04:40,029
There's something very lovely
and real about Hannah.

65
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:44,743
She gives me a very deep feeling
of being part of something.

66
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:48,915
She's a wonderful woman...
and I betrayed her.

67
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,669
She came into my empty life
and changed it,

68
00:04:51,794 --> 00:04:55,507
and I paid her back by
banging her sister in a hotel room.

69
00:04:55,632 --> 00:04:59,721
God, I'm despicable.
What a cruel and shallow thing to do.

70
00:04:59,846 --> 00:05:02,266
I have to call her and say
what we did was crazy.

71
00:05:02,391 --> 00:05:06,605
It can't happen again. I'm not that kind
of man, and I value Hannah too much.

72
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:10,318
I love my wife.
Now I betrayed her. Oh, God!

73
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:14,699
- Where are you going?
- I've, uh, got to get a phone number.

74
00:05:14,824 --> 00:05:17,244
- I forgot to phone Mel Kaufman.
- It's so late.

75
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:19,413
Yeah, I can't believe I forgot.

76
00:05:20,539 --> 00:05:23,293
If he answers, I'll hang up.

77
00:05:23,418 --> 00:05:28,091
I'll tell her we can't communicate until
I terminate my marriage. It's immoral.

78
00:05:28,216 --> 00:05:32,346
Then time will pass, I won't call,
and she'll get the idea.

79
00:05:32,472 --> 00:05:35,142
Gotta stop this before I get in too deep.

80
00:05:35,267 --> 00:05:39,355
I'd rather hurt Lee a little
than destroy Hannah.

81
00:05:39,481 --> 00:05:44,362
It's 1.30. She can't have a conversation
with me with him around.

82
00:05:44,487 --> 00:05:46,615
I'm getting hysterical.

83
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,076
I'll call her first thing in the morning.

84
00:05:49,201 --> 00:05:50,870
I'll call her at six.

85
00:05:50,995 --> 00:05:55,877
Frederick goes jogging at six.
I'll call her and nip it in the bud.

86
00:05:56,002 --> 00:05:57,003
(phone rings)

87
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:59,214
I've got it! I've got it!

88
00:06:00,132 --> 00:06:01,676
Hello?

89
00:06:01,801 --> 00:06:03,261
Mel!

90
00:06:03,386 --> 00:06:06,808
I would have hung up if you hadn't
answered and I won't do this again,

91
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:10,854
but I just had to tell you...
I feel very close to you tonight.

92
00:06:11,021 --> 00:06:13,233
Very, very close.

93
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:15,193
Good night.

94
00:06:29,295 --> 00:06:32,674
(Mickey) Millions of books written
on every conceivable subject

95
00:06:32,799 --> 00:06:37,472
by all these great minds, and in the end
none of them knows anything more

96
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:40,434
about the big questions of life than I do.

97
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,397
Jesus, I read Socrates.

98
00:06:43,522 --> 00:06:47,902
This guy used to knock off little Greek
boys. What the hell's he got to teach me?

99
00:06:48,028 --> 00:06:52,450
And Nietzsche, with his
theory of eternal recurrence.

100
00:06:52,575 --> 00:06:55,913
He said that the life we live,
we're gonna live over and over again

101
00:06:56,038 --> 00:06:58,750
the exact same way for eternity.

102
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:04,465
Great. That means I'll have to sit through
the "Ice Capades" again. It's not worth it.

103
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:07,678
And Freud, another great pessimist.

104
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:11,057
I was in analysis for years.
Nothing happened.

105
00:07:11,182 --> 00:07:16,314
My poor analyst got so frustrated,
the guy finally put in a salad bar.

106
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:18,776
Look at all these peoplejogging,

107
00:07:18,901 --> 00:07:22,072
trying to stave off
the inevitable decay of the body.

108
00:07:22,197 --> 00:07:24,867
Boy, it's so sad what people go through

109
00:07:24,992 --> 00:07:29,164
with their stationary bike
and their exercise.

110
00:07:29,289 --> 00:07:33,837
Look at this one. Poor thing.
She has to tote all that fat around.

111
00:07:33,962 --> 00:07:36,215
She should pull it on a dolly.

112
00:07:37,174 --> 00:07:41,096
Maybe the poets are right.
Maybe love is the only answer.

113
00:07:41,221 --> 00:07:44,559
I was in love with Hannah,
but it didn't work out too well.

114
00:07:44,684 --> 00:07:47,813
I even took her sister out.
Remember that, years ago?

115
00:07:47,938 --> 00:07:52,694
When Hannah and I got divorced and
she fixed me up with her sister Holly?

116
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,406

- I can't hear you. I can't hear anything.

123
00:08:25,862 --> 00:08:30,326
- I'm gonna lose hearing in my ear.
- Listen, you're witnessing genius.

124
00:08:30,493 --> 00:08:33,747
My ears are experiencing a meltdown.
I can't hear anything.

125
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:36,459
Can't you feel the energy,
the tangible energy?

126
00:08:36,626 --> 00:08:39,088
The room's alive with positive vibrations.

127
00:08:39,213 --> 00:08:43,135
I'm frightened. After they sing,
they're gonna take hostages.

128
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,763
Don't, no, please.

129
00:08:45,888 --> 00:08:49,184
- You want some? Come on!
- No, you've been doing that all night.

130
00:08:49,309 --> 00:08:53,022
You're gonna burn a hole...
You're gonna develop a third nostril.

131
00:08:53,148 --> 00:08:56,569
- Don't, please. Can we go?
- No!

# Because I'm gonna buy the records

133
00:09:02,535 --> 00:09:05,789
I love songs about
extraterrestrial life. Don't you?

134
00:09:05,914 --> 00:09:09,878
- Not if they're sung by extraterrestrials.
- I cannot communicate with you!

135
00:09:10,003 --> 00:09:12,047
I never knew you were such a tight-ass.

136
00:09:12,172 --> 00:09:16,177
Both your sisters have such good taste
in music. Where did you go wrong?

137
00:09:16,302 --> 00:09:18,263
Do you mind? I'm my own person.

138
00:09:18,389 --> 00:09:21,601
- Can I take you to hear something nice?
- It's getting late.

139
00:09:21,726 --> 00:09:24,855
- Come on, cos you're being angry.
- I'm not angry!

140

You don't believe in ESP, you don't
like rock music, you won't get high...

00:09:56,354 --> 00:10:00,693
# The reason is cos something's
happened to me

150
00:10:01,194 --> 00:10:03,405
# I'm in love again

151
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:07,243
# And the spring is comin'

152
00:10:07,368 --> 00:10:09,413
# I'm in love again

153
00:10:10,414 --> 00:10:13,293
# Hear my heartstrings strummin'

154
00:10:13,418 --> 00:10:15,462
# I'm in love again

155
00:10:16,088 --> 00:10:19,259
# And the hymn they're hummin'

156
00:10:19,384 --> 00:10:24,599
# Is those cuddle-up, huddle-up blues

157
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:26,769
# I'm in love again

158
00:10:27,812 --> 00:10:31,066
# And I can't rise above it

159
00:10:31,233 --> 00:10:33,444
# I'm in love again

160
00:10:33,569 --> 00:10:36,907
# And I love, love, love it

161
00:10:37,699 --> 00:10:40,286
- Thanks for a swell time(!)
- If you didn't like it,

162
00:10:40,453 --> 00:10:42,080
you didn't have to talk over him.

163
00:10:42,247 --> 00:10:45,626
- I was so bored.
- Tough. You don't deserve Cole Porter!

164
00:10:45,793 --> 00:10:48,380
Stay with groups that look like
they'll stab their mothers.

165
00:10:48,505 --> 00:10:52,468
- At least I'm open to new concepts.
- And you snort cocaine all the time.

166
00:10:52,594 --> 00:10:54,680
Do you carry a kilo in your purse?

167
00:10:54,805 --> 00:10:58,393
This crowd wouldn't know the difference.
They're embalmed.

168
00:10:58,518 --> 00:11:02,356
I'm glad Hannah got us together.
She's got a great instinct for people(!)

169
00:11:02,481 --> 00:11:05,235
- I'm sorry it didn't work out.
- Yeah, me too.

170
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,823
- I've been a little depressed lately.
- I had a great time tonight.

171
00:11:08,948 --> 00:11:12,870
- It was like the Nuremberg trials.
- I'll see myself home!

172
00:11:15,081 --> 00:11:17,250
(Mickey) Yep, it was quite an evening.

173
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:20,046
Holly with her cocaine. Jesus!

174
00:11:20,171 --> 00:11:23,801
She should have been wearing
a gold shovel around her neck.

175
00:11:23,926 --> 00:11:27,639
She was polymorphously
insensitive, I think.

176
00:11:27,764 --> 00:11:29,141
Too bad, too,

177
00:11:29,266 --> 00:11:32,562
because I always had
a little crush on her.

178
00:11:39,905 --> 00:11:42,783
(# "You Made Me Love You")

179
00:12:06,981 --> 00:12:09,026
You just have to read the instructions.

180
00:12:09,151 --> 00:12:12,822
You set one of these things
and you can take pictures underwater.

181
00:12:12,947 --> 00:12:15,492
When we get to the country,
we'll try it in the lake.

182
00:12:15,618 --> 00:12:17,662
- Can I try?
- Yeah, OK.

183
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,677
Are you in a bad mood?

184
00:12:29,803 --> 00:12:32,348
I don't know. I'm just antsy.

185
00:12:32,473 --> 00:12:35,477
Yes, I know. The last few weeks
you haven't been yourself.

186
00:12:35,643 --> 00:12:39,148
And tonight at dinner
you were kind of curt with me.

187
00:12:39,273 --> 00:12:41,151
- Was I?
- Yes, you were.

188
00:12:41,317 --> 00:12:45,865
And when I brought up the idea of having
a baby, you jumped down my throat.

189
00:12:46,032 --> 00:12:49,036
- Well, I don't think it's a very good idea.
- Why not?

190
00:12:49,203 --> 00:12:52,457
Because it's the last thing
in the world we need right now.

191
00:12:52,624 --> 00:12:54,835
Why do you say that?
Is something wrong?

192
00:12:55,002 --> 00:12:57,964
- I don't know.
- Well, tell me. Should I be worried?

193
00:12:58,339 --> 00:13:02,136
- Well, you got four children.
- I want one with you.

194
00:13:02,261 --> 00:13:06,350
Well... I think we should
wait till things settle.

195
00:13:06,475 --> 00:13:08,603
What does that mean?

196
00:13:08,728 --> 00:13:12,316
We've been married four years.
How settled can things get?

197
00:13:12,441 --> 00:13:16,154
You have some very set plans on
how your life should be structured.

198
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:20,118
A house, kids, certain school,
a home in Connecticut...

199
00:13:20,243 --> 00:13:22,704
It's all very... preconceived.

200
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:26,125
Yeah, but I... I thought you needed that.

201
00:13:26,251 --> 00:13:28,629
When we met,
you said your life was chaos.

202
00:13:28,754 --> 00:13:32,425
I know, but there's
gotta be some give and take.

203
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:36,597
Oh, listen. I don't know
what the hell I'm talking about.

204
00:13:36,722 --> 00:13:38,934
- Are you angry with me?
- No!

205
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:42,647
Do you feel, um...
Are you disenchanted with our marriage?

206
00:13:42,772 --> 00:13:45,192
- I didn't say that.
- Do you love someone else?

207
00:13:45,317 --> 00:13:49,072
My God, what is this? The Gestapo? No!

208
00:13:49,197 --> 00:13:52,493
- What are you not telling me?
- What kind of interrogation...?

209
00:13:52,618 --> 00:13:56,331
Suppose I said "Yes, I am disenchanted,
I am in love with someone else"?

210
00:13:56,456 --> 00:13:59,418
- Are you?
- No!

211
00:13:59,544 --> 00:14:03,966
But you keep asking awful questions.
It's like you want me to say yes!

212
00:14:04,091 --> 00:14:08,722
What are you talking about?
Of course not. I'd be destroyed.

213
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:11,684
For Christ's sake, stop torturing her.

214
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:14,605
Tell her you want out and get it over with.

215
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:18,693
You're in love with her sister.
You didn't do it on purpose.

216
00:14:18,818 --> 00:14:22,031
Be honest. It's always the best way.

217
00:14:22,156 --> 00:14:24,451
Can I help you?

218
00:14:24,576 --> 00:14:27,788
If you're suffering over something,
will you share it with me?

219
00:14:27,914 --> 00:14:29,958
Hannah.

220
00:14:30,751 --> 00:14:32,962
You know how much I love you.

221
00:14:35,173 --> 00:14:38,844
I ought to have my head examined.
I don't deserve you.

222
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:49,358
(Holly) I want to look good,
but I don't want to feel overdressed.

223
00:14:49,483 --> 00:14:51,903
- No, not at all.
- Well, how about this?

224
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:55,699
I really like that.
I think that's a pretty colour on you.

225
00:14:55,866 --> 00:14:59,121
Ever think you'd be helping me
buy something to wear to the opera?

226
00:14:59,287 --> 00:15:01,457
I think it's great. I can't wait to meet him.

227
00:15:01,624 --> 00:15:06,004
He's married and his wife's in and out
of institutions. She's schizophrenic.

228
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:09,092
Sometimes she's terrific,
and then she just breaks down.

229
00:15:09,217 --> 00:15:14,265
He has a sweet daughter. When she goes
to college, he's gonna split permanently.

230
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:17,937
He's paid his dues, but she helped
him through architectural school.

231
00:15:18,062 --> 00:15:20,231
You found all this out on one date?

232
00:15:20,356 --> 00:15:23,861
I figured he's dying to open up. It's so sad.

233
00:15:23,986 --> 00:15:26,990
Now, what should I wear to my audition?

234
00:15:27,115 --> 00:15:31,204
I've got a singing audition for a Broadway
musical. Of course, I'll never get it.

235
00:15:31,329 --> 00:15:33,165
- Singing?
- Can you believe it?

236
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:36,460
- Really?
- Well, I mean, why not, you know?

237
00:15:36,586 --> 00:15:42,343
- What have I got to lose?
- I know, I just... I didn't know you sang.

238
00:15:43,219 --> 00:15:45,722
You think everybody in
musicals sings so well?

239
00:15:45,848 --> 00:15:47,642
No, no.

240
00:15:47,767 --> 00:15:49,728
Just that... they sing.

241
00:15:49,853 --> 00:15:51,897
Well, you know...

242
00:15:53,274 --> 00:15:57,488
- I sing a little. I mean...
- Oh, I know. No, I know.

243
00:15:58,698 --> 00:16:01,493
Don't say that, cos confidence
is not my strong point.

244
00:16:01,618 --> 00:16:04,205
No, I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

245
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,374
I think I can fake my way through a song.

246
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:08,544
- Uh-huh?
- Easily.

247
00:16:10,755 --> 00:16:15,469
- Why? You don't think it's realistic?
- No, I didn't... That's... No.

248
00:16:15,594 --> 00:16:20,267
I just hate to see you put yourself
in a position where you get hurt.

249
00:16:20,392 --> 00:16:22,770
You know how you take
every single rejection

250
00:16:22,895 --> 00:16:26,317
as a confirmation that you
have no talent or something.

251
00:16:26,442 --> 00:16:29,362
- Yeah, well, maybe I'll get it.
- I hope.

252
00:16:29,487 --> 00:16:32,575
Boy, you really know
how to cut me down.

253
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,662
What? No, don't be so sensitive.
Can't I say anything?

254
00:16:35,787 --> 00:16:39,417
Well, I sing! For Christ's sake,
Hannah, you heard me sing!

255
00:16:39,542 --> 00:16:42,212
OK! What happened?

256
00:16:42,337 --> 00:16:47,678
We were having a really nice time, and
suddenly everything went to bad feeling.

257
00:16:47,803 --> 00:16:50,556
Nobody but you can do that to me.
I don't know why.

258
00:16:50,681 --> 00:16:53,435
Look, everything's going your way.

259
00:16:54,561 --> 00:16:57,232
You're right. I'm happy!

260
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:03,448
Why must I let my insecurities
spoil everything?

261
00:17:03,907 --> 00:17:07,328
# (Holly) This year's fancies

262
00:17:07,495 --> 00:17:11,041
# Are passing fancies

263
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:13,252
# But sighing sighs

264
00:17:13,377 --> 00:17:15,338
# Holding hands

265
00:17:15,463 --> 00:17:17,341
# This my heart

266
00:17:17,466 --> 00:17:19,677
# Understands

267
00:17:20,386 --> 00:17:23,682
# I'm old-fashioned

268
00:17:23,808 --> 00:17:27,604
# And I don't mind it

269
00:17:27,729 --> 00:17:31,776
# It's how I want to be

270
00:17:31,901 --> 00:17:36,073
# As long as you'll agree

271
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:42,749
# To stay old-fashioned

272
00:17:42,874 --> 00:17:46,837
# With me

273
00:17:46,962 --> 00:17:48,631
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

274
00:17:48,756 --> 00:17:51,260
- It was very nice.
- Terrific.

275
00:17:51,385 --> 00:17:53,179
April Knox?

276
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:02,649
# Someday

277
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:05,820
# When I'm awfully low

278
00:18:06,321 --> 00:18:09,158
# When the world is cold

279
00:18:09,742 --> 00:18:11,661
# I will get a glow

280
00:18:11,786 --> 00:18:15,625
# Just thinking of you

281
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:21,883
# And the way you look tonight

282
00:18:23,468 --> 00:18:26,180
(Holly) You sounded great.
You may be surprised.

283
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:29,726
(April) I'm glad we have a catering job
this week. I'm low on money.

284
00:18:29,851 --> 00:18:33,690
Yeah, we have Mr Morris Levine's
80th birthday on Riverside Drive,

285
00:18:33,815 --> 00:18:37,236
or Riverside Memorial Chapel,
depending on his health.

286
00:18:37,361 --> 00:18:39,697
Oh, listen. David called me up.

287
00:18:39,822 --> 00:18:40,991
What?

288
00:18:41,116 --> 00:18:45,413
David called me last night.
He wants to take me to the opera.

289
00:18:45,538 --> 00:18:48,626
- I didn't know what to say.
- You're joking.

290
00:18:48,751 --> 00:18:50,962
No, he called late last night.

291
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:55,009
I, uh... I'm very surprised.

292
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,887
He wanted to take me to see Rigoletto.

293
00:18:58,013 --> 00:19:01,017
- And you're going?
- Well, I didn't know what to say.

294
00:19:01,142 --> 00:19:03,186
First I said no, but then he pressed it.

295
00:19:03,353 --> 00:19:07,650
He said he'd taken you once
and he really wanted to invite me.

296
00:19:09,402 --> 00:19:11,864
- But I'm seeing him.
- I know, I said that.

297
00:19:12,031 --> 00:19:16,245
But he said it was something
he really felt like doing.

298
00:19:16,411 --> 00:19:18,372
Gee, um...

299
00:19:18,539 --> 00:19:21,168
I don't know what to say.

300
00:19:22,044 --> 00:19:26,591
It's just an evening at the opera.
Did I do wrong in accepting?

301
00:19:27,551 --> 00:19:29,387
Huh?

302
00:19:34,643 --> 00:19:37,981
Why do you think that you would
like to convert to Catholicism?

303
00:19:38,106 --> 00:19:42,570
Well, because I've gotta have something
to believe in, or life is meaningless.

304
00:19:42,695 --> 00:19:48,244
I understand, but why did you make the
decision to choose the Catholic faith?

305
00:19:48,369 --> 00:19:51,290
First of all because it's
a very beautiful religion

306
00:19:51,415 --> 00:19:54,294
and it's a strong religion.
It's very well structured.

307
00:19:54,419 --> 00:19:58,925
I mean the against-school-prayer,
pro-abortion, anti-nuclear wing.

308
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:01,136
So at the moment
you don't believe in God?

309
00:20:01,261 --> 00:20:06,434
No, and I want to. I'm willing to do
anything. I'll dye Easter eggs, if it works.

310
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:09,146
I need some evidence.
I gotta have some proof.

311
00:20:09,271 --> 00:20:12,943
If I can't believe in God,
then I don't think life is worth living.

312
00:20:13,068 --> 00:20:17,282
- It means making a very big leap.
- Yes, well, can you help me?

313
00:20:17,407 --> 00:20:20,077
(wailing) Why? Oh, my God!

314
00:20:20,202 --> 00:20:23,123
I don't understand.
I thought you'd be happy.

315
00:20:23,248 --> 00:20:26,252
- How can we be happy?
- Because I never thought of God before.

316
00:20:26,377 --> 00:20:30,090
- Now I'm giving it some thought.
- Catholicism? Why not your own people?

317
00:20:30,215 --> 00:20:35,388
Because I got off to a wrong foot with
my own thing. I need a dramatic change.

318
00:20:35,514 --> 00:20:39,477
- You're gonna believe in Jesus Christ?
- I know it sounds funny, but I'll try.

319
00:20:39,602 --> 00:20:42,982
- But why? We raised you as a Jew.
- Just cos I was born that way...

320
00:20:43,107 --> 00:20:46,319
- I'm old enough to make decisions.
- But why Jesus Christ?

321
00:20:46,444 --> 00:20:50,700
- Why shouldn't you become a Buddhist?
- That's totally alien to me.

322
00:20:50,825 --> 00:20:52,953
You're old. Aren't you afraid of dying?

323
00:20:53,078 --> 00:20:55,623
- Why should I be afraid?
- Cos you won't exist.

324
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:57,709
- So?
- That doesn't terrify you?

325
00:20:57,834 --> 00:21:00,963
Who thinks about such nonsense?
When I'm dead, I'll be dead.

326
00:21:01,088 --> 00:21:04,259
- But aren't you frightened?
- Of what? I'll be unconscious.

327
00:21:04,384 --> 00:21:06,429
I know, but never to exist again?

328
00:21:06,595 --> 00:21:09,266
- How do you know?
- It doesn't look promising.

329
00:21:09,432 --> 00:21:13,479
Who knows what I'll be?
I'll either be unconscious or I won't.

330
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:17,067
If not, I'll deal with it then.
I'm not gonna worry now.

331
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:18,694
Mom, come out!

332
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:23,117
(mother) Of course there's a God,
you idiot! You don't believe in God?

333
00:21:23,284 --> 00:21:26,037
If there's a God, why is there
so much evil in the world?

334
00:21:26,204 --> 00:21:28,958
On a simplistic level,
why were there Nazis?

335
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:32,212
- Tell him, Max.
- How the hell do I know?

336
00:21:32,337 --> 00:21:34,840
I don't know how the can opener works.

337
00:21:34,965 --> 00:21:38,053
(# choir singing Latin hymn)

338
00:22:57,572 --> 00:23:00,409
- Hi.
- Hi. Where's Holly?

339
00:23:00,534 --> 00:23:03,872
She's auditioning for a TV commercial.
She said she'd be late.

340
00:23:03,997 --> 00:23:08,128
- How's she doing?
- When she's depressed, she's manic.

341
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:10,714
I think it was a good idea
to invite her to lunch.

342
00:23:10,839 --> 00:23:16,054
I hope you say it was your idea. Every
time I try to help, she gets so defensive.

343
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:19,100
She's just embarrassed
in front of you, that's all.

344
00:23:19,267 --> 00:23:21,144
- So how are you?
- Me? I'm OK.

345
00:23:21,311 --> 00:23:22,938
- Do you miss Frederick?
- No.

346
00:23:23,105 --> 00:23:26,109
Elliot and I can't think of anyone
for you to go out with...

347
00:23:26,276 --> 00:23:30,073
How are you? Are you doing OK?
How's Frederick? I mean, Elliot?

348
00:23:30,239 --> 00:23:35,496
I guess he's fine. I don't know. He's been
kinda moody lately, the last few months.

349
00:23:35,663 --> 00:23:38,876
I don't know what's wrong.
He's distant and difficult.

350
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:41,796
When I try to talk to him,
he says everything's fine.

351
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:45,760
I just leap to the worst conclusion,
that he's seeing someone else or...

352
00:23:45,885 --> 00:23:48,346
Oh, no. Everyone thinks things like that.

353
00:23:48,471 --> 00:23:53,353
Well, I just came from an audition
which I did not get. So what's new?

354
00:23:53,478 --> 00:23:57,149
- They said I was too offbeat-looking.
- What the hell do they know?

355
00:23:57,274 --> 00:23:59,569
- And guess who's there, auditioning.
- April?

356
00:23:59,694 --> 00:24:02,114
- Oh, gosh.
- You got it. I was very polite.

357
00:24:02,239 --> 00:24:05,326
I maintained my poise. I said hello.

358
00:24:05,452 --> 00:24:08,998
I never trusted April.
She has eyes in the back of her head.

359
00:24:09,123 --> 00:24:13,921
She and the architect are now a very
definite item, which I still cannot believe,

360
00:24:14,046 --> 00:24:17,217
although it's put an end to the
Stanislavski Catering Company.

361
00:24:17,342 --> 00:24:20,012
I have to speak to you,
and you're gonna get impatient,

362
00:24:20,137 --> 00:24:22,348
but I have to borrow some more money.

363
00:24:22,474 --> 00:24:26,270
- Well, that's fine...
- What I've decided to do is some writing.

364
00:24:26,395 --> 00:24:30,442
I've had it with acting. These
meaningless auditions are cattle-calls.

365
00:24:30,567 --> 00:24:34,030
I can't handle another rejection.
You know, let's face it here.

366
00:24:34,155 --> 00:24:37,368
I've gotta latch onto something in my life.

367
00:24:37,493 --> 00:24:43,084
Something with a future.
I'm not 16 any more. It's just... crazy.

368
00:24:43,209 --> 00:24:47,798
But I've got an idea for a story,
more than one,

369
00:24:47,923 --> 00:24:51,636
and I just need a few months,
or a year, even.

370
00:24:51,762 --> 00:24:55,349
I've picked up a lot about
dramatic structure from acting class.

371
00:24:55,475 --> 00:25:00,898
That's good. It just seems to me
that... six months or a year,

372
00:25:01,023 --> 00:25:03,443
if you spent it more productively...

373
00:25:03,568 --> 00:25:06,823
- Like what?
- Well, I don't know. Um...

374
00:25:06,948 --> 00:25:11,036
Didn't Mom mention there was something
at the Museum of Broadcasting?

375
00:25:11,162 --> 00:25:15,793
- That's clerical.
- No, it was in the publicity department.

376
00:25:15,918 --> 00:25:19,255
- That can lead to other things.
- I knew you'd be discouraging!

377
00:25:19,422 --> 00:25:21,717
I'm not. I'm trying to be helpful.

378
00:25:21,842 --> 00:25:26,306
You don't just say one day "I'm
finished as an actress. Now I'm a writer. "

379
00:25:26,431 --> 00:25:29,519
- You mean, not at my age.
- Please, we came to have lunch.

380
00:25:29,644 --> 00:25:33,190
Yeah, OK, right. Forget it. What's to eat?

381
00:25:33,357 --> 00:25:36,736
I just want a salad.
You really think I'm a loser, don't you?

382
00:25:36,903 --> 00:25:39,281
- You're being ridiculous.
- You are. Stop it.

383
00:25:39,448 --> 00:25:41,743
- You treat me like a loser.
- How?

384
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:44,997
You never have faith in my plans,
you undercut my enthusiasm...

385
00:25:45,122 --> 00:25:47,667
Not so, no. I think
I've been very supportive.

386
00:25:47,792 --> 00:25:50,671
I try to give you honest,
constructive advice.

387
00:25:50,796 --> 00:25:53,007
I'm always happy to help you financially.

388
00:25:53,132 --> 00:25:56,679
I've gone out of my way to introduce you
to interesting single men...

389
00:25:56,804 --> 00:25:59,474
- They're all losers.
- You're too demanding.

390
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:02,895
I could tell what you thought of me
by the men you fixed me up with.

391
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:05,482
- That's not true!
- I know I'm mediocre.

392
00:26:05,607 --> 00:26:09,028
Would you stop attacking Hannah?
She's going through a rough time.

393
00:26:09,153 --> 00:26:12,741
- Why are you so upset?
- You've picked on her since she came in.

394
00:26:12,866 --> 00:26:15,078
Leave her alone. I'm suffocating.

395
00:26:15,203 --> 00:26:17,915
What's the matter, Lee?
Why are you so sensitive?

396
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,793
Listen. You wanna write, write.

397
00:26:20,918 --> 00:26:23,171
Let's just not talk about it any more.

398
00:26:23,296 --> 00:26:26,926
Take a year, take six months,
whatever you want.

399
00:26:27,051 --> 00:26:30,931
Who knows? Maybe you'll
be sitting with a good play.

400
00:26:31,056 --> 00:26:34,561
What's the matter with you?
You look pale. Are you OK?

401
00:26:34,686 --> 00:26:37,064
Yeah, you know, I'm just...

402
00:26:37,189 --> 00:26:42,029
I've got dizzy all of a sudden and
I have a headache. I think we need to eat.

403
00:26:57,883 --> 00:27:04,099
(Elliot) I can't seem to take action.
I'm like Hamlet, unable to kill his uncle.

404
00:27:04,224 --> 00:27:07,771
I want Lee, but I can't harm Hannah.

405
00:27:07,896 --> 00:27:10,983
And in no other area
am I a procrastinator.

406
00:27:13,361 --> 00:27:17,033
Meanwhile, Lee has no direction.
She's taking courses at Columbia.

407
00:27:17,199 --> 00:27:19,160
Butjust randomly.

408
00:27:19,285 --> 00:27:22,707
I try not to call her, but then she calls me,

409
00:27:22,832 --> 00:27:28,756
and then I call, and we try to resist
meeting, but once in a while we meet.

410
00:27:28,923 --> 00:27:32,511
Sometimes we argue because
I can't break up my marriage.

411
00:27:32,636 --> 00:27:37,601
Sometimes we wind up making love,
and we both feel terrible.

412
00:27:37,935 --> 00:27:39,937
But it's my fault.

413
00:27:41,314 --> 00:27:45,945
For all my education, accomplishments
and so-called wisdom,

414
00:27:46,112 --> 00:27:49,074
I can't fathom my own heart.

415
00:27:49,241 --> 00:27:51,077
# Krishna, Krishna

416
00:27:51,243 --> 00:27:53,622
# Hare, Hare...

417
00:27:53,747 --> 00:27:56,041
Why do you want to be a Hare Krishna?

418
00:27:56,166 --> 00:28:01,840
Well, I'm not saying I want to join, but I
know you guys believe in reincarnation.

419
00:28:01,966 --> 00:28:04,928
- What's your religion?
- I was born Jewish.

420
00:28:05,053 --> 00:28:08,558
Last winter I tried to become a Catholic,
and it didn't work for me.

421
00:28:08,683 --> 00:28:10,769
I studied and I gave it everything,

422
00:28:10,894 --> 00:28:14,398
but Catholicism for me was:
die now, pay later.

423
00:28:14,524 --> 00:28:18,153
- I couldn't get with it, and I wanted to.
- Are you afraid of dying?

424
00:28:18,278 --> 00:28:20,698
Well, yeah, naturally. Aren't you?

425
00:28:20,823 --> 00:28:24,411
Does reincarnation mean my soul
would pass to another human being,

426
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:27,582
or would I come back as a moose
or an aardvark or something?

427
00:28:27,707 --> 00:28:31,963
Take our literature,
read it over and think about it.

428
00:28:32,088 --> 00:28:36,218
- OK. Thank you very much.
- You're welcome. Hare Krishna.

429
00:28:39,139 --> 00:28:42,017
Who are you kidding?
You're gonna be a Krishna?

430
00:28:42,143 --> 00:28:46,106
You're gonna shave your head and put on
robes and dance around at airports?

431
00:28:46,231 --> 00:28:48,860
You'll look like Jerry Lewis.

432
00:28:48,985 --> 00:28:51,029
God, I'm so depressed.

433
00:29:01,251 --> 00:29:04,129
(Lee) The nights are really getting cooler.

434
00:29:04,254 --> 00:29:08,135
Summer went so quickly. Soon it'll be fall.

435
00:29:10,179 --> 00:29:12,932
My literature professor really likes me.

436
00:29:13,058 --> 00:29:16,103
It was fun being out with him last night.

437
00:29:16,228 --> 00:29:20,609
Funny, I feel like I'm betraying Elliot,
but that's ridiculous.

438
00:29:20,734 --> 00:29:23,988
Why shouldn't I see Doug?
Elliot's not free.

439
00:29:25,073 --> 00:29:27,117
Just go one step at a time.

440
00:29:28,202 --> 00:29:31,164
Let's see what the next few months bring.

441
00:29:31,957 --> 00:29:34,085
Hannah? Hi!

442
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:39,008
Listen, you'll be happy to know that your
money has not gone completely to waste.

443
00:29:39,175 --> 00:29:43,138
No, I have an actual first rough draft
of something I wrote.

444
00:29:43,305 --> 00:29:45,349
Yeah, yeah.

445
00:29:45,516 --> 00:29:48,687
I showed it to Lee and
she gave me some good pointers.

446
00:29:48,812 --> 00:29:52,567
Listen, I'm pretty near where you live.
Could I just drop it off?

447
00:29:52,734 --> 00:29:57,407
When you have some time, read it,
and we'll talk at Thanksgiving.

448
00:29:57,573 --> 00:30:00,661
OK? All right. Oh, wait, listen.

449
00:30:01,537 --> 00:30:06,961
I think Lee met an interesting guy
at Columbia. He sounds really nice.

450
00:30:08,045 --> 00:30:12,676
Yeah, OK, all right. Well,
we'll talk at Thanksgiving. Bye-bye.

451
00:30:14,136 --> 00:30:17,474
Now, here's a song that Norma sang

452
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:20,436
on that trip we made
up to the show in Buffalo.

453
00:30:20,561 --> 00:30:23,524
And, oh, was she beautiful that night!

454
00:30:23,649 --> 00:30:26,277
- Come on!
- Oh, yes, you were, dear.

455
00:30:26,402 --> 00:30:30,574
Don't you remember that night?
She was so beautiful

456
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:33,119
that when men saw her
walking along the street,

457
00:30:33,245 --> 00:30:37,125
they'd drive their cars
right up on the sidewalk.

458
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:40,003
- That right, honey?
- A slight exaggeration.

459
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:42,173
But only slight.

460
00:30:43,257 --> 00:30:45,302
(# piano playing)

461
00:31:08,832 --> 00:31:10,960
You've been very cold to me tonight.

462
00:31:11,085 --> 00:31:12,754
No.

463
00:31:12,879 --> 00:31:15,132
Is something wrong?

464
00:31:15,257 --> 00:31:18,344
Not here.
There are too many people around.

465
00:31:20,264 --> 00:31:21,974
Hey, Hannah?

466
00:31:22,099 --> 00:31:27,773
I think Lee is really serious about
her new boyfriend. He sounds really nice.

467
00:31:27,898 --> 00:31:30,986
I'm so happy for her. I think she's in love.

468
00:31:31,111 --> 00:31:34,949
- Hey, what's the matter?
- I'm real upset about what you wrote.

469
00:31:35,074 --> 00:31:37,911
- My script?
- It's obviously based on Elliot and me.

470
00:31:38,037 --> 00:31:41,541
- Oh, so loosely.
- No, not loosely. Real specifically!

471
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:43,293
Is that how you see us?

472
00:31:43,419 --> 00:31:47,966
Can I not accept gestures and feelings
from people? Do I put people off?

473
00:31:48,133 --> 00:31:50,803
- It's a made-up story.
- No, it's real exact!

474
00:31:50,928 --> 00:31:53,223
The situations, dialogue, everything.

475
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:56,561
It's full of intimate details
between Elliot and me,

476
00:31:56,686 --> 00:31:59,898
which I don't see how you
could even possibly know about!

477
00:32:00,065 --> 00:32:02,276
A conversation we once had
about adoption?

478
00:32:02,443 --> 00:32:05,989
Lee mentioned that to me,
so obviously you discussed it with her.

479
00:32:06,156 --> 00:32:08,451
I took the essence and
I blew it up into drama.

480
00:32:08,576 --> 00:32:12,289
How could Lee know about these things?
I don't tell her everything.

481
00:32:12,414 --> 00:32:14,208
Wow. I guess I hit a nerve.

482
00:32:14,333 --> 00:32:18,923
You make it sound like I have no needs.
You think I'm too self-sufficient?

483
00:32:19,048 --> 00:32:21,635
Hannah, that's not what I meant.
You know?

484
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,555
Everybody relies on you
for so much. You're so giving!

485
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:27,058
It's no criticism.
We love you, we're grateful.

486
00:32:27,183 --> 00:32:29,436
You're grateful but you resent me.

487
00:32:29,562 --> 00:32:33,275
Wow. I don't wanna have this
conversation. I didn't do anything wrong.

488
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:36,362
You told me yourself
you and Elliot were having problems.

489
00:32:36,487 --> 00:32:39,074
We were, but they're my business.

490
00:32:39,199 --> 00:32:41,786
I don't see how you could
know it in such detail!

491
00:32:41,911 --> 00:32:45,499
How does Lee know about these things?
How? They're private!

492
00:32:45,624 --> 00:32:49,462
- Why don't you share them with us?
- I don't want to bother everyone.

493
00:32:49,587 --> 00:32:52,216
That's the point. I'd like to be bothered.

494
00:32:52,341 --> 00:32:56,054
How could you know about these things?
Has Elliot been talking to you?

495
00:32:56,179 --> 00:32:59,892
No, he hasn't. If I offended you, I'm sorry.

496
00:33:03,105 --> 00:33:06,234
It's over, Elliot.
I don't know how to be any clearer.

497
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:09,071
- I know I deserve it...
- I'm just as much at fault.

498
00:33:09,196 --> 00:33:12,701
- I have such feelings for you...
- I've got to be honest with you.

499
00:33:12,826 --> 00:33:13,869
I've met someone else.

500
00:33:13,994 --> 00:33:16,455
- What do you mean?
- I've met someone else.

501
00:33:16,581 --> 00:33:20,544
- I told you I wouldn't wait for ever.
- It hasn't been for ever.

502
00:33:20,669 --> 00:33:24,007
It's been nearly a year and
you're still married to my sister,

503
00:33:24,132 --> 00:33:28,012
which I now realise is fine. You're much
more in love with her than you know.

504
00:33:28,137 --> 00:33:31,850
- But we made so many plans.
- And in a way you led me on.

505
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:34,395
I truly believed you were
unhappy with Hannah.

506
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,815
Otherwise I would
never have been drawn in.

507
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:40,445
I was very weak. So were you.
Now I've met someone...

508
00:33:43,949 --> 00:33:46,828
- Dinner soon?
- About 15 minutes.

509
00:33:49,248 --> 00:33:52,502
- But you're in love overnight.
- I care a great deal about him, yes.

510
00:33:52,669 --> 00:33:56,507
- Lee...
- It's over. Elliot, I mean it. It's over.

511
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:03,391
Sweetheart, I loved your script.
I thought it was so clever.

512
00:34:03,558 --> 00:34:06,478
You're my mother.
Not everybody's gonna be such a sucker.

513
00:34:06,604 --> 00:34:09,023
I particularly liked
the character of the mother,

514
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:12,653
just a boozy old flirt with a filthy mouth.

515
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:15,240
- I'm so proud!
- Oh, Mom, thanks.

516
00:34:16,283 --> 00:34:18,494
Here's a toast to Thanksgiving, all right?

517
00:34:18,619 --> 00:34:22,374
Are we supposed to have beer?
Yes, let me hear it!

518
00:34:22,499 --> 00:34:24,377
How's that, Fletcher?

519
00:34:24,502 --> 00:34:28,632
Doll, to Thanksgiving. Here's a little
toast, doll. Come on, bottoms up!

520
00:34:29,258 --> 00:34:33,388
Have you been talking to Holly or Lee
about us, about our personal life?

521
00:34:33,513 --> 00:34:35,182
(Elliot) Me? Of course not.

522
00:34:35,307 --> 00:34:40,439
Holly wrote things about us that are so
personal, they must have come from you.

523
00:34:40,564 --> 00:34:43,318
I've got a headache and
I don't like being accused!

524
00:34:43,443 --> 00:34:49,659
I'm not accusing, I'm asking. Do you
find me too giving, too competent?

525
00:34:49,784 --> 00:34:52,913
- Too disgustingly perfect or something?
- No.

526
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:56,209
What is it? What's come between us?
How have I alienated you?

527
00:34:56,335 --> 00:34:59,797
- Hannah, my head is throbbing.
- You never wanna talk about it.

528
00:34:59,923 --> 00:35:03,969
Every time I bring it up,
you change the subject. What is it?

529
00:35:04,095 --> 00:35:06,932
We're communicating less,
you sleep with me less...

530
00:35:07,057 --> 00:35:10,019
Hannah, I am very mixed up! Now, please!

531
00:35:10,144 --> 00:35:13,440
Do you talk to Holly or Lee
behind my back? Do you?

532
00:35:13,565 --> 00:35:15,901
You must. They seem to
know so much about us.

533
00:35:16,027 --> 00:35:18,989
Maybe I've asked advice
once or twice, or made a joke.

534
00:35:19,114 --> 00:35:22,952
Do you talk to Holly, or Lee,
or what? Do you phone them?

535
00:35:23,077 --> 00:35:25,122
Leave me alone, can you?!

536
00:35:25,247 --> 00:35:28,209
Jesus, I've told you.
I need someone I can matter to!

537
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:30,837
You matter to me, completely.

538
00:35:30,963 --> 00:35:34,926
It's hard to be around someone who gives
so much and needs so little in return.

539
00:35:35,051 --> 00:35:36,929
I have enormous needs.

540
00:35:37,054 --> 00:35:40,558
Well, I can't see them,
and neither can Lee or Holly!

541
00:36:41,053 --> 00:36:43,932
(Hannah) It's so pitch black tonight.

542
00:36:45,684 --> 00:36:47,729
I feel lost.

543
00:36:49,147 --> 00:36:51,191
(Elliot) You're not lost.

544
00:37:00,829 --> 00:37:02,873
I love you so much.

545
00:37:53,313 --> 00:37:57,527
I don't know if you remember me, but we
had the worst night of my life together.

546
00:37:57,652 --> 00:37:59,863
- I remember you.
- Yes, you do recall?

547
00:37:59,989 --> 00:38:04,119
I was walking past and I just
saw you and I thought I'd come in.

548
00:38:04,244 --> 00:38:08,166
- We didn't hit it off.
- We did all but exchange gunshots.

549
00:38:08,291 --> 00:38:10,586
- How are you?
- Good. You look wonderful.

550
00:38:10,752 --> 00:38:13,047
- Oh, no.
- Yeah? No, you do.

551
00:38:13,172 --> 00:38:16,885
It was a terrible evening. Remember
slamming the cab door in my face?

552
00:38:17,052 --> 00:38:20,473
You came dangerously close
to emasculating my nose

553
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:24,145
- in a really horrible way.
- That was a long time ago.

554
00:38:24,312 --> 00:38:26,231
- People change.
- I hope you've changed.

555
00:38:26,398 --> 00:38:28,525
- I hope you have too.
- I hope so, for your sake.

556
00:38:28,692 --> 00:38:33,532
Your personality left something
to be desired, namely a personality.

557
00:38:33,657 --> 00:38:36,035
So how are you? What are you doin'?

558
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,707
Oh, nothing much. Just some stuff.
Little of this, little of that.

559
00:38:39,832 --> 00:38:43,962
Was that an embarrassing question?
Are you out of work or something?

560
00:38:44,087 --> 00:38:48,051
- No, well, I've been trying to write.
- Have you? That's interesting.

561
00:38:48,176 --> 00:38:50,304
- What kind of stuff?
- Oh...

562
00:38:50,429 --> 00:38:53,600
- You're not interested in this.
- No, you can tell me. I am.

563
00:38:53,725 --> 00:38:56,270
Millions must say to you
"I've written something. "

564
00:38:56,395 --> 00:38:58,606
- Nobody ever said it. This is it.
- Really?

565
00:38:58,731 --> 00:39:04,238
- Would you be willing to read something?
- Yes, if it would mean anything to you.

566
00:39:04,363 --> 00:39:08,369
I don't know why it would.
You've always hated my taste in the past.

567
00:39:08,494 --> 00:39:10,663
- No, I haven't!
- You have.

568
00:39:10,788 --> 00:39:16,003
I think it might make a great television
script, and you're so active in television.

569
00:39:16,129 --> 00:39:20,009
Not any more.
I haven't been in television for a year.

570
00:39:20,134 --> 00:39:25,057
No, I may have to get back into it cos my
accountant says I'm running out of cash.

571
00:39:25,182 --> 00:39:29,771
But no, I sort of dropped out for a year,
which is a long, dull story.

572
00:39:29,896 --> 00:39:33,151
- You're OK, though?
- Yes, I'm fine. How are you?

573
00:39:33,276 --> 00:39:35,070
- I'm fine.
- What about your script?

574
00:39:35,195 --> 00:39:38,699
I'd love it if you'd read it
cos I really would value your opinion.

575
00:39:38,825 --> 00:39:42,913
But you have to remember while you're
reading and you're cursing my name

576
00:39:43,038 --> 00:39:46,126
that this is my first script.
Well, it's not my first.

577
00:39:46,251 --> 00:39:49,839
That was about Hannah and
her husband, but Hannah read it.

578
00:39:49,964 --> 00:39:52,384
She got really angry and I felt badly.

579
00:39:52,509 --> 00:39:57,515
- I can't imagine what you wrote.
- It wasn't anything bad, but I don't know...

580
00:39:57,641 --> 00:40:00,728
So I threw it out, but I have this other one.

581
00:40:00,853 --> 00:40:04,358
Well, you know,
if you want me to, I would read it.

582
00:40:04,483 --> 00:40:07,236
I don't know... Could I come over
tomorrow and read it to you?

583
00:40:07,362 --> 00:40:11,200
Come over tomorrow and read it to me?
You must be joking!

584
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:14,579
I've been doing
all my own reading since I was 40.

585
00:40:14,704 --> 00:40:17,667
I think it's lucky I ran into you. Maybe.

586
00:40:17,792 --> 00:40:19,836
What about me? I should have kept going.

587
00:40:19,961 --> 00:40:23,799
I have a nagging sensation
that I should have kept walking

588
00:40:23,966 --> 00:40:26,261
and not begun this conversation.

589
00:40:27,513 --> 00:40:30,266
(Holly) "We go through life
playing the hand we're dealt. "

590
00:40:30,391 --> 00:40:33,562
"Craig: And what hand were you dealt?"

591
00:40:33,729 --> 00:40:38,360
"Emily: I'm two high pair,
maybe even aces up. "

592
00:40:38,527 --> 00:40:41,572
"The problem is,
you've got three deuces. "

593
00:40:42,907 --> 00:40:44,952
That's the end.

594
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:51,043
No, you can tell me straight.
It's OK. Just tell me what you think.

595
00:40:51,168 --> 00:40:52,879
It's great.

596
00:40:53,004 --> 00:40:55,257
I'm... speechless.

597
00:40:55,883 --> 00:40:59,888
I was not in the mood
to listen to this thing now.

598
00:41:01,682 --> 00:41:05,603
I don't know what to say.
I'm moved and I laughed and I...

599
00:41:05,729 --> 00:41:08,190
I was on the edge of my seat.
It's wonderful.

600
00:41:08,315 --> 00:41:11,695
I'm totally stunned. This is not an insult.

601
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:16,159
I'm amazed that you can...
I just thought it was great.

602
00:41:16,284 --> 00:41:18,954
- Really?
- Yes. I was absolutely...

603
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:22,000
What made you think
of that climax scene,

604
00:41:22,125 --> 00:41:25,629
where the architect is walking home
with his actress girlfriend

605
00:41:25,755 --> 00:41:29,342
and the schizophrenic ex-wife
jumps out and stabs him to death?

606
00:41:29,468 --> 00:41:33,431
- It just came to me one day.
- It was just fabulous.

607
00:41:33,556 --> 00:41:35,851
Gosh, you really think I can write?

608
00:41:35,976 --> 00:41:38,938
There's one or two things
I would do differently myself,

609
00:41:39,063 --> 00:41:42,401
but who cares? It was fabulous.

610
00:41:42,526 --> 00:41:47,741
I mean It. I'm so impressed!
I am. You've made my day.

611
00:41:47,866 --> 00:41:52,331
It was just great.
I was set to be bored stiff.

612
00:41:52,456 --> 00:41:56,836
- Would you like to have lunch?
- I would love to talk about the script.

613
00:41:56,962 --> 00:41:59,381
- I think we could do something with it.
- OK.

614
00:41:59,506 --> 00:42:02,969
And I'd like to hear what made you
suddenly decide to drop out of life.

615
00:42:03,094 --> 00:42:05,681
- Who cares?
- No, I care.

616
00:42:05,806 --> 00:42:08,602
You used to be so ambitious and...

617
00:42:08,727 --> 00:42:10,980
God, you really liked it?!

618
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:37,764
Gosh, you really went through a crisis,
you know that? How did you get over it?

619
00:42:37,931 --> 00:42:43,522
When I ran into you, you seemed
just perfectly fine. You seem fine now.

620
00:42:43,689 --> 00:42:48,612
Well, I'll tell you. One day,
about a month ago, I really hit bottom.

621
00:42:48,737 --> 00:42:53,284
Ijust felt that in a Godless universe,
I didn't want to go on living.

622
00:42:53,409 --> 00:42:58,875
Now, I happen to own this rifle, which
I loaded and pressed to my forehead,

623
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,503
and I remember thinking.;
I'm gonna kill myself.

624
00:43:01,628 --> 00:43:04,507
Then I thought.; what ifl'm wrong?

625
00:43:04,632 --> 00:43:07,803
What ifthere is a God?
After all, nobody really knows that.

626
00:43:07,928 --> 00:43:11,308
But then I thought.;
no, maybe is not good enough.

627
00:43:11,433 --> 00:43:13,936
I want certainty or nothing.

628
00:43:14,061 --> 00:43:17,148
And I remember very clearly
the clock was ticking

629
00:43:17,274 --> 00:43:20,319
and I was sitting there, frozen,
with the gun to my head,

630
00:43:20,444 --> 00:43:22,822
debating whether to shoot.

631
00:43:22,948 --> 00:43:25,034
(gunshot)

632
00:43:25,159 --> 00:43:30,791
All ofa sudden, the gun went off. I had
been so tense, I'd squeezed the trigger.

633
00:43:30,916 --> 00:43:35,380
But I was perspiring so much, the gun
had slid off my forehead and missed me.

634
00:43:35,506 --> 00:43:39,594
- (gunshot)
- Neighbours were pounding on the door

635
00:43:39,719 --> 00:43:42,807
and, I don't know, the whole scene
wasjust pandemonium.

636
00:43:42,932 --> 00:43:48,648
And I ran to the door, I didn't know what
to say. I was embarrassed and confused.

637
00:43:48,773 --> 00:43:53,112
My mind was racing a mile a minute,
and Ijust knew one thing.

638
00:43:53,237 --> 00:43:59,703
I had to get out of that house, just
get out in the fresh air and clear my head.

639
00:43:59,829 --> 00:44:03,625
And I remember very clearly
I walked the streets.

640
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:09,842
I didn't know what was going through my
mind. It all seemed so violent and unreal.

641
00:44:09,967 --> 00:44:13,555
And I wandered for a long time
on the Upper West Side.

642
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:19,187
It must have been hours. My feet hurt and
my head was pounding. I had to sit down.

643
00:44:19,312 --> 00:44:23,568
I went into a movie house. I didn't know
what was playing. Ijust needed a moment

644
00:44:23,693 --> 00:44:26,154
to gather my thoughts and be logical

645
00:44:26,321 --> 00:44:29,742
and put the world
back into rational perspective.

646
00:44:29,909 --> 00:44:31,953
(# playing a tune)

647
00:44:38,629 --> 00:44:41,966
And I went upstairs
to the balcony and I sat down.

648
00:44:42,133 --> 00:44:47,348
The movie was a film that I'd seen
many times in my life since I was a kid,

649
00:44:47,515 --> 00:44:49,643
and I always loved it.

650
00:44:49,810 --> 00:44:52,230
And I'm watching these people
up on the screen

651
00:44:52,397 --> 00:44:55,609
and I started getting hooked on the film.

652
00:44:55,776 --> 00:45:02,284
And I started to feel.; how can you even
think of killing yourself?. Isn't that stupid?

653
00:45:02,410 --> 00:45:04,537
Look at all the people on the screen.

654
00:45:04,662 --> 00:45:08,167
They're real funny, and
what ifthe worst is true?

655
00:45:08,292 --> 00:45:12,548
What ifthere's no God and you
only go around once and that's it?

656
00:45:12,673 --> 00:45:15,134
Don't you want to be
part of the experience?

657
00:45:15,259 --> 00:45:18,096
What the hell? It's not all a drag.

658
00:45:18,222 --> 00:45:21,601
I'm thinking to myself.;
I should stop ruining my life,

659
00:45:21,726 --> 00:45:26,900
searching for answers I'm never gonna
get, andjust enjoy it while it lasts.

660
00:45:27,025 --> 00:45:31,823
And after, who knows? Maybe there
is something. Nobody really knows.

661
00:45:31,948 --> 00:45:37,789
I know "maybe" is a slim reed to hang
your life on, but it's the best we have.

662
00:45:37,914 --> 00:45:43,546
Then I started to sit back and
I actually began to enjoy myself.

663
00:45:43,671 --> 00:45:45,257
# Oh, Freedonia

664
00:45:45,382 --> 00:45:47,134
# Oh, don't you cry for me

665
00:45:47,259 --> 00:45:49,303
# Cos I'm coming round the mountain

666
00:45:50,388 --> 00:45:51,807
Um...

667
00:45:51,932 --> 00:45:56,187
Look, there's something that's been
bothering me for a long time.

668
00:45:56,313 --> 00:46:01,319
I just thought I'd tell you what it was
and just sort of clear the deck here.

669
00:46:01,444 --> 00:46:05,783
I've always regretted the way I behaved
that evening we went out.

670
00:46:05,908 --> 00:46:09,997
- I just thought I'd tell you that...
- Don't be silly. Don't be ridiculous.

671
00:46:10,122 --> 00:46:13,293
I was the... You know, it was my fault.

672
00:46:14,795 --> 00:46:19,676
So you wanna go out to dinner again?
Do you have any interest in that?

673
00:46:19,801 --> 00:46:23,139
- Sure.
- Are you free this evening?

674
00:46:23,264 --> 00:46:25,267
Yeah, yeah.

675
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,611
I want ice! Who's got some?

676
00:46:33,778 --> 00:46:35,321
Oh, there it is.

677
00:46:35,446 --> 00:46:37,491
Hey, where's Holly? She's late.

678
00:46:37,658 --> 00:46:40,536
Did you read Holly's last thing?
She's really developed.

679
00:46:40,662 --> 00:46:42,706
She really writes good dialogue.

680
00:46:42,873 --> 00:46:45,334
Hannah, can I say you're
going to play Desdemona?

681
00:46:45,501 --> 00:46:49,006
- Mom, it's only television.
- But it's public television.

682
00:46:49,131 --> 00:46:52,135
To me, Shakespeare doesn't
get any greater than Othello.

683
00:46:52,302 --> 00:46:56,515
- You with some big, black stud. I love it!
- Oh, honey!

684
00:47:22,424 --> 00:47:25,428
(Elliot) Oh, Lee. You are something.

685
00:47:26,512 --> 00:47:30,643
You look very beautiful.
Marriage agrees with you.

686
00:47:32,979 --> 00:47:37,944
Everything that happened between us
seems more and more hazy.

687
00:47:39,321 --> 00:47:43,451
I acted like such a fool.
I don't know what came over me.

688
00:47:44,035 --> 00:47:47,999
The complete conviction
that I couldn't live without you.

689
00:47:48,666 --> 00:47:51,044
What I put us both through!

690
00:47:51,169 --> 00:47:56,343
And Hannah, who, as you once said,
I love much more than I realised.

691
00:48:00,223 --> 00:48:03,811
Hi! Happy Thanksgiving!

692
00:48:05,187 --> 00:48:09,026
- Hi, Daisy. I didn't miss dinner, did I?
- No.

693
00:48:09,151 --> 00:48:12,238
Hi, Marge. Happy Thanksgiving!

694
00:48:12,363 --> 00:48:15,451
Happy Thanksgiving, Amy.

(# piano playing "Isn't It Romantic")

696
00:49:16,613 --> 00:49:18,657
It's beautiful.

00:49:22,204 --> 00:49:24,290

- You look so beautiful.
- Thanks.

701
00:49:31,382 --> 00:49:35,721
I was talking to your father before.
I was telling him that it's ironic.

702
00:49:35,846 --> 00:49:38,600
I used to always have
Thanksgiving with Hannah.

703
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:42,104
I never thought that
I could love anybody else.

704
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:47,820
And here it is, years later, and I'm married
to you, and completely in love with you.

705
00:49:47,945 --> 00:49:51,950
The heart is a very,
very resilient little muscle.

706
00:49:54,078 --> 00:49:59,168
It would make a great story, I think. A guy
marries one sister and it doesn't work out.

707
00:49:59,293 --> 00:50:04,425
Then, years later,
he winds up married to the other sister.

708
00:50:04,592 --> 00:50:07,470
I don't know how you're gonna top that.

- Mickey?
- What?
