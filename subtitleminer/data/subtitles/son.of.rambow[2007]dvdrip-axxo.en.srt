Brother William,
would you like to read today?

2
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,911
O, God, our heavenly father,

3
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,709
who has commanded us to love
one another as Thy children.

4
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,351
<i>I could've killed them all.
I could've killed you.</i>

5
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,273
<i>In town, you're the law.
Out here, it's me.</i>

6
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,510
<i>Don't push it.</i>

7
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,990
<i>Don't push it or I'll give you a war
you won't believe.</i>

8
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:04,278
<i>Let it go.</i>

9
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,669
<i>Let it go.</i>

10
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,112
<i>He's stuck there.
He can't go any place!</i>

11
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,317
<i>If you don't
fly this thing, Ray,</i>

12
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,994
<i>I swear to God, I'm gonna kill you.</i>

13
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,915
<i>Hold it steady, you sonofabitch!</i>

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,393
<i>Get that man a cigar!</i>

15
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,434
<i>- Get in the car.
- Get in the car!</i>

16
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,270
William. William, your lace.

17
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,913
William, where did you find this?
This watch doesn't belong to you.

18
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,877
Do you understand?

19
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,555
Jess, stop it. You put it back
where you found it, William.

20
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,156
<i>Voila. Montez-le. Comme ça.</i>

21
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,152
Toute droite. Toute droite comme ca,
un petit peut plus.

22
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,117
Tres bien. Bravo, c'est magnifique.

23
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:44,274
<i>I'm saying it might be
in your interest to listen,</i>

24
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:49,639
and you'd do well to keep your wits
about you when I talk about scree.

25
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,789
OK? So, show time.

26
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,871
Er, thanks for your help.

27
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,997
Erm, we're gonna be watching
a documentary now,

28
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,958
and you're not allowed
to watch television, are you?

29
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,839
Right, you got something
to be getting on with? OK, good.

30
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,558
Right.

31
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:14,111
<i>That is expensive and not for you
to be messing around with, alright?</i>

32
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:29,152
<i>Fire. When treated with care,
it can be man's greatest tool.</i>

33
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,437
<i>But, if used incorrectly,</i>

34
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,512
<i>it can be his most deadly foe.</i>

35
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,596
<i>That's it!</i>

36
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,955
<i>- What?
- You know damn well what!</i>

37
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,270
<i>I don't have a tennis ball!</i>

38
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,755
Go on. Fetch.

39
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,358
<i>Nice drawings.</i>

40
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,675
- Rarrr!
- My book!

41
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,835
Oh, sorry. There you go.

42
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,196
Don't you want it?
I thought you said you wanted it. Hmm?

43
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,794
- I thought you said you wanted it!
- No!

44
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,788
<i>Morning, Janet.
A couple of miscreants</i>

45
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,919
for the attention of "She Who Must Be".

46
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,836
- Lee Carter, sit down.
- Yeah.

47
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,309
- Sit down.
- Alright.

48
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,198
He's got St Vitus' Dance, that one,
I tell you.

49
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,396
<i>OK, thank you.</i>

50
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,595
What is your name?

51
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,391
Will Proudfoot.

52
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,953
Listen, mate,

53
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:27,271
I don't mind taking the blame
for this if you like.

54
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,559
But, er, if I do, you, er, might
have to give me something in return.

55
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,436
Fair enough. I always fancied a watch.

56
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:41,718
You probably don't mind getting a
letter sent home and being tortured.

57
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,909
Didn't you know? About the torture?

58
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,398
Oh, yeah. The last time she tortured me,

59
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,519
I could barely stand up for a week.
Pain like you'd never believe.

60
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,433
Doctor said they might
have to amputate it off.

61
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,232
Well, can't keep the lady waiting,
can we?

62
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,428
Let's just, er,
get this over and done with.

63
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,597
- I'll pray for you, Lee Carter.
- Cheers.

64
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,472
<i>Dear God, make sure Lee
Carter doesn't get... too badly hurt.</i>

65
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:50,235
<i>Now, voici Michelle Gina.</i>

66
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,517
<i>Sharon Davy, Michelle DuBois.</i>

67
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,391
<i>Gail Graham?</i>

68
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,835
Dit bonjour a Marie Planté.

69
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,557
David Smart.

70
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,075
Voici monsieur Lucas Dupont.

71
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,839
- Duncan Miller?
- Yep.

72
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,434
Voici Monsieur Didier Revol!

73
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,791
Bienvenue, Didier.

74
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,677
<i>Let me help you, Lee Carter.</i>

75
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:22,833
God, that bitch was rough. She must
have loved that bloody goldfish.

76
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:27,118
I'll be alright though, in a week.
Maybe two. I don't know.

77
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,598
Can you... smell that?

78
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,035
That stench is the smell

79
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,680
- of Lee Carter.
- Up yours, Tina.

80
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,988
- Scab.
- Slapper.

81
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,638
- Scab.
- Er, slapper.

82
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,110
- Scab.
- I blame the parents.

83
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,794
Well, that's me, then.
I'd better be off.

84
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,995
<i>No, don't worry, I'll be fine.</i>

85
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:54,197
Time heals all wounds. Oh, God!

86
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,591
<i>Come on! Damn it!</i>

87
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,830
Had to be the one with the bloody
trailer on the back, didn't it?

88
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,117
- Where are you going?
- Oh, erm...

89
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,715
the Head said I could have the
afternoon off after her torturing me.

90
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,792
How can you cycle with your leg all bad?

91
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,554
- Right here?
- Yeah, exactly.

92
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,830
<i>- Is this where you live?
- Yeah, this is my house.</i>

93
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:01,550
Yeah. Of course it isn't, you idiot.
It's a short cut. Keep pedalling.

94
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,189
Hey, boy, that video you're selling me,
it all wonky.

95
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,350
I can't see nothing but fuzzy lights.

96
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,637
I told you about that, Dora.
It's your tracking.

97
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,511
Are you alright, Frank?

98
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,713
<i>That's Frank.</i>

99
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,711
<i>So, this is where you live?</i>

100
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,588
<i>Oh, no. This is the family
business. My home's through here.</i>

101
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,715
So, this is your home?

102
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,598
Yep, this is it. Home, sweet home.

103
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,518
Hold that a sec.

104
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,871
What are you doing?

105
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,871
I know what we could do.

106
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:04,270
If you don't tell me where they are
hiding, then I have no choice

107
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,955
but to shoot you and your cat.
Do you have any last requests?

108
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,519
I...

109
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,515
Skill. Skills on toast.

110
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,512
You know, I've been thinking.
The watch is nice, but, well,

111
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,909
it only really covers me
getting tortured.

112
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,434
I did have to, you know,
take the blame and lie.

113
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,829
What do I get for all that?

114
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,751
I don't have another watch.

115
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:35,516
I don't mean another watch. I get to
choose how you pay me back, right?

116
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,431
- Right.
- To properly pay me back,

117
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,751
<i>you'll be the stuntman in the film
I'm making for Screen Test,</i>

118
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:44,992
and you're not allowed to tell anyone
or I'll smash your face in. Alright?

119
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,799
<i>- What's Screen Test?
- Exactly. Top secret.</i>

120
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,872
<i>Oh, shit. It's Lawrence.</i>

121
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,558
- Get up there.
- What?

122
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:08,235
Get up there! Go! Come on!

123
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,948
<i>- Lawrence.
- You made them pirates of Rambo?</i>

124
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,553
Yeah. I was just doing it.

125
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,359
<i>Don't use my camera
for that Screen Test bollocks.</i>

126
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,669
I wasn't! Honest!
Lawrence, get 'em off me!

127
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,798
Get off!

128
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,599
<i>- Come on.
- Get off! Ow!</i>

129
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,911
More torture?

130
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,429
Yeah. It's not my day.

131
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,593
Oh, yeah, stay there. I'll be back in a
minute.

132
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,750
- Hello, mate.
- Ooh-ohh!

133
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,354
- What is that all about?
- Ooh-ohh!

134
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,029
Happy birthday, bro.

135
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,872
You... Oi!

136
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,956
You thought I'd forgot, didn't you?

137
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,712
- These are very nice. Thanks, mate.
- Cheers, mate.

138
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,950
<i>Don't push it.</i>

139
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:59,237
<i>Don't push it or I'll give you a war
you won't believe.</i>

140
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,598
<i>Let it go.</i>

141
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,953
<i>You don't wanna accept the fact
that you're dealing with an expert</i>

142
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:22,352
<i>in guerrilla warfare,
with a man who's the best with guns,</i>

143
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,671
<i>with knives, with his bare hands,
a man who's been trained</i>

144
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,991
<i>to ignore pain, ignore weather,</i>

145
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:33,756
<i>to live off the land, to eat things
that would make a billy goat puke.</i>

146
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:38,994
<i>In Vietnam, his job was to dispose
of enemy personnel. To kill. Period.</i>

<i>Win by attrition.</i>

148
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,277
<i>Well, Rambo was the best.</i>

149
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:48,239
<i>Are you telling me 200 men against
your boy is a no-win situation?</i>

150

<i>- You send that many, don't forget...
- What?</i>

151
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,673
<i>A good supply of body bags.</i>

152
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,513
200 men!

153
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,115
He's gone.

154
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,035
You can come down now.

155
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,470
<i>Do you have any last requests?</i>

156
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,557
Oi, stuntman, your face
was well funny on that one.

157
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:48,195
<i>Henry, come back here!</i>

158
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,110
<i>Who are you?</i>

159
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,592
Who are you?

160
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,878
<i>I am the son of Rambo!</i>

161
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,793
What have you done with my Dad?

162
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,679
No!

163
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:08,155
<i>The sins you commit
are for the good of others.</i>

164
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,953
Come on, Dad. We're going home.

165
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,509
<i>The wheel
is man's greatest invention,</i>

166
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,909
<i>but it is the greatest
bringer of death.</i>

167
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:40,274
You told anyone
you were over at my house?

168
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,557
I swear to God, if you tell anyone
I'm making this film,

169
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:47,030
I'll smash your face in.
You still owe me, right?

170
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,554
So be at my house at ten tomorrow.

171
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,551
And don't be late.

172
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,998
We've finished watching TV now.
You can come back in.

173
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:02,629
<i>You'll learn something
very much to your advantage.</i>

174
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,314
Yes, I promise to astonish you

175
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,676
with news of how a river can operate

176
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:12,275
above the level of the flood plain, OK?

177
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:15,955
And how do they do that?
How does a river operate

178
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:20,830
above the level of the flood plain?
Is it because it's a bit arrogant,

179
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,229
thinks it's a bit better
than the flood plain,

180
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:26,869
or is it because of active deposition
of silt in times of flood?

181
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,713
Arrogant river? Deposition of silt?

182
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,837
It is actually the silt,
and I'm going to show you...

183
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:36,629
Erm, the silt
goes into a sort of super silt.

184
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:44,196
Bless, O Lord, this food to our use
and bless us to your service,

185
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:48,114
make us mindful of the needs of others,
through Jesus Christ, Amen.

186
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,393
<i>Jess! Jess!</i>

187
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:00,152
Only you could lose something
strapped to your wrist.

188
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,356
I should've taken it off you.

189
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,958
Don't go in that shed again.
Do you understand?

190
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,071
Do you understand?!

191
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:21,235
I need you all up early
for the preaching tomorrow.

192
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,470
- But I can't come.
- Of course you can.

193
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,677
- No, see, there's this boy at school...
- There's lots of boys.

194
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:30,799
No, I mean... This one was badly hurt,

195
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,475
and I promised to help him
with his chores tomorrow.

196
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,991
What happened to him?

197
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:48,152
He... He had a terrible accident,

198
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,038
and I promised I'd help him
with his chores tomorrow.

199
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,958
That's...

200
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,195
That's very kind of you.

201
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,714
Look, I'm sorry for getting angry
all the time.

202
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:05,395
It's... Anyway, you can go
and help this boy if you want.

203
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,271
Thanks, Mummy.

204
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,271
Two minutes.

205
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:33,873
Good morning, Lee Carter.
I'm here to help you!

206
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,632
Jesus Christ!

207
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,518
<i>Oi! The bacon's burning!</i>

208
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,551
Get in that bush.

209
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,435
<i>I'm waiting in the bush. Shhh!</i>

210
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:54,194
- Who was it?
- Oh, some Bible-basher. Here.

211
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,229
Want brown sauce on that or what?

212
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,437
Oi! What about my tea?

213
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,191
- Ready?
- Ready!

214
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:11,033
Three, two, one, go!

215
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,949
- You alright?
- I'm alright, Lee Carter!

216
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,429
- Ready?
- Yep, ready!

217
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,033
And action!

218
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:32,356
<i>Cut! Cut!</i>

219
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,835
And cut. Great.

220
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,514
- Ready?
- Yep, ready!

221
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,790
Right. Action!

222
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:58,679
<i>Ow! Uh! Ohh!</i>

223
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,079
Great. Cut. You alright, Will?

224
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,437
Will?

225
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,431
You alright, buddy?

226
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:15,036
<i>What are you doing?</i>

227
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,510
<i>I am the son of Rambo!</i>

228
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,075
Hang on.
You wanna be the son of Rambo?

229
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,590
- I have to go now.
- Come back tomorrow.

230
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:43,956
- I ain't finished yet.
- OK. Bye, then.

231
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,633
Oh, and I'm glad your legs
are feeling better.

232
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,238
Nutcase.

233
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,951
<i>Ow!</i>

234
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,231
Oh.

235
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,993
I don't know
if I've made enough for five.

236
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,958
I could share mine with you,
if you like, Brother Joshua.

237
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,475
Oh, no. Well, erm... that won't be...

238
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:25,154
I'm not staying. I just...

239
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,278
I'll see you in the morning
for prayer meeting.

240
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,837
Yes!

241
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,038
- Ah. You all set?
- Mother had an accident in the night.

242
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,951
- Ah. Oh, dear.
- Two minutes.

243
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,837
Of course.

244
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,669
<i>I tried to dress Grandma,
but Jess took over.</i>

245
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,433
William... your shoes.

246
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:39,035
You got something else to wear?
We're leaving for prayer meeting now.

247
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,430
- Oh, William.
- Shall I take them to the menders'

248
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,795
<i>and meet you there?</i>

249
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,792
<i>Mummy!
Grandma's lying on the floor!</i>

250
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,553
<i>Yes. Meet us there.
Sorry about this.</i>

251
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,596
Not a problem.

252
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:58,155
- Good morning, William.
- Good morning, Brother Joshua.

253
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,592
Should be ready by three o'clock.

254
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,512
<i>Thank you.</i>

255
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,356
<i>Keep it in a straight line, woman!</i>

256
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,637
- This is why I won't let you drive!
- Jesus!

257
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,188
<i>I've got everything!</i>

258
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,794
Yeah, I can see that, you freak!

259
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,791
- Wow!
- Thanks.

260
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,877
I think that's everyone.

261
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,749
I'm sure he'll wait for us here.

262
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,034
<i>- What's the dog thingy?
- That's the flying dog.</i>

263
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:23,398
He guards the prison where
the scarecrow keeps my dad, Rambo.

264
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:26,153
<i>Right, and why have they
got him prisoner?</i>

265
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,470
<i>He's an evil scarecrow.</i>

266
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,915
<i>And then you save him, yeah?</i>

267
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,433
Yes!

268
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:38,438
OK, we'll do your story,
but we're doing it my way.

269
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:41,353
It doesn't mean I have to split
the prize with you, OK?

270
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:45,558
<i>Yes, Colonel! Whoo-hoo!</i>

271
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,830
Son of Rambo, Take One. Click.

272
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:54,155
<i>OK, ready and action!</i>

273
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,949
I've come to save you, Rambo!

274
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:03,199
We need to leave here right now
before the evil scarecrow finds us!

275
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:07,273
Oh. What about my tea?

276
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,796
Oh, son,
it's like a prison with them lot

277
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,270
marching in and out every five minutes,
shouting at you,

278
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:18,638
turning you over
while you're trying to sleep.

279
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:23,714
"Eat your food," they say.
It's not fit for dogs.

280
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:29,718
And the screams at night.
There's folk screaming in their beds.

281
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:35,397
But I don't know if they're hurting
or just... afraid of something.

282
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,472
I'm rescuing you, Father!
We're going to escape!

283
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,028
I need to spend a penny first.

284
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,715
Lord have mercy! What are you doing?
I'll kill you! Get out of here!

285
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:48,588
They make you look so stupid! They
should be ashamed what they do to you.

286
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,557
The boy's taking me home.

287
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:54,189
The boys was just pretending.
You're not going nowhere, pops.

288
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,350
You're staying in your room.

289
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,471
Yes.

290
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:03,034
<i>They're on our trails.</i>

291
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,032
You'd better swing across the lake.
I'll get back up.

292
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,951
Meet you in the prison in one hour.

293
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:11,999
Don't worry, I'm trained to ignore pain
and live off the land.

294
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,798
Just go!

295
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,517
They're firing at us! Take cover!

296
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,797
OK!

297
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,360
Yeah, keep swimming to the other side.

298
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,317
I can't swim!

299
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:40,835
What do you mean, you can't swim?

300
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,311
Oh, shit!

301
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:41,753
Thank you for coming to save me,
Colonel Trautman.

302
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,352
Will?

303
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,237
Will?

304
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:13,355
<i>I'll just have to say I got
lost or something. I don't know.</i>

305
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:19,479
<i>If this film doesn't win Screen Test,
I'm gonna be a monkey's uncle.</i>

306
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,074
Right, come on.
We're gonna be blood brothers now.

307
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:26,152
- What's blood brothers?
- Come here.

308
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,830
How long do we have to hold it
like this for?

309
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,559
Until we hear that wood pigeon again.

310
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:52,355
I gave your watch to my brother.

311
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:56,995
Oh, so I won't ever get it back, then?

312
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,196
No. He likes it.

313
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,874
Wasn't mine anyway. It was my dad's.

314
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:05,509
Is he pissed off with you?

315
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,750
He's dead.

316
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,630
Oh. Right.

317
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:14,315
- How did he die?
- Mowing the lawn.

318
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:23,832
It wasn't the mowing that did it,
you idiot.

319
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,911
He had a thing called an aneurysm.

320
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,878
A little vein in his head popped,
and that was that.

321
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,110
He just, sort of, fell to the ground

322
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,829
and the lawnmower kept going
and tipped up and... into the fence

323
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:38,276
and made this really loud noise
as if it was hungry or something.

324
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:42,069
It kept going "Rrrr,"
until they switched it off.

325
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:47,791
- Jesus! I hope my veins don't pop.
- Me, too.

326
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,553
My brother said you can kill someone
with one punch.

327
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,074
Really?
Yeah. If you hit 'em right in the nose,

328
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,913
their bone goes up through their brain
and kills 'em.

329
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,309
Wow! Has he ever killed anyone
like that?

330
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,234
No. He could if he wanted to, though.
He's pretty skill at everything.

331
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,550
Do you like him?

332
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,632
Well, yeah, course I do.
He's my brother, isn't he?

333
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,597
What about your dad?

334
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:13,433
My dad? No.
He pissed off before I was born.

335
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:17,035
Then my mum met Colin, the bloke with
the big hair? He owns the care home,

336
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:19,634
so we all live there.
It's alright, I suppose.

337
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:23,110
But he lives in Spain, so my mum's
always over there with him.

338
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,430
She gets tons of duty-free and stuff,

339
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,557
which is kind of skill,
cos it's mostly just me and Lawrence.

340
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:32,030
We get to do what we want, muck
about. There's no-one to tell us off.

341
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,475
Seriously, though, parents...

342
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:38,519
You're pretty much better off
without 'em. That's what I say.

343
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:44,474
- Colonel Trautman.
- Yeah?

344
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,950
Not including the bit
about losing my dad's watch,

345
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,634
this has been my best day of all time.

346
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:58,677
Oh! We've scabbed.

347
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:07,031
<i>O my God, I've come to say
thank you for your love today.</i>

348
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:11,432
Thank you for my family
and all the friends you give to me.

349
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:15,559
Guard me in the dark of night
and in the morning, send your light.

350
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,437
Amen.

351
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,512
He's been lying, Mary.

352
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,160
He's confused.
He's trying to be a good Samaritan.

353
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,800
You've had more than your share
of loss in life,

354
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,713
and none of us wants to see you
lose your son to outsiders,

355
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,870
but you must speak with him now.

356
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:41,350
<i>Warn him.
Let him know that the path he is on</i>

357
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:45,831
can lead only to misery,
not just for himself but for all of you.

358
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:50,469
There's a group meeting tomorrow.
I thought it might do him good

359
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,516
to come along, get him back on track.

360
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:57,390
- Could you get him out of school?
- Of course. I'll make sure he's ready.

361
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,954
Well... good night, Mary.

362
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,232
And the Lord must greatly resent
the attempt to pursue a double life

363
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,709
that goes hand in hand with the world

364
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:25,839
and presuming to be fully brethren
at the same time.

365
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,876
Hear, hear.

366
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:32,988
God is faithful, who has called us
into the fellowship of his Son.

367
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:36,675
It works out that way,
instead of being enticed.

368
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:39,228
God doesn't entice anybody into evil.

369
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:44,713
We're enticed, led astray,
by our own flesh,

370
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,314
according to the scripture.

371
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,431
Oi, you! Come back!

372
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:19,390
<i>- Come on, then!
- Oi, you! Come back!</i>

373
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,799
See ya!

374
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:40,513
My father won't send us to your school.
He said the pupils are a bad influence.

375
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,114
Is it true, Brother William?

376
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,911
I suppose so.

377
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,911
What are you looking at?

378
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:19,232
Well, you'll be wearing this stuff
one day, mate.

379
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,671
Thank you for taking him, Joshua.

380
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:12,877
We all need a little guidance
from time to time.

381
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:16,236
I'd hoped he might see me
as a kind of father figure.

382
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:20,349
- You were hungry.
- Yes, very.

383
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,350
Well, I'd better be going.

384
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,639
- Good night, Mary.
- Good night. Good night.

385
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,675
- What was he saying?
- Come with me.

386
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:08,308
He thought you were great.
Really, he did.

387
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,391
<i>Next!</i>

388
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,270
Where have you been, eh?

389
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:23,033
If you didn't wanna make this film,
you should've said,

390
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:25,918
rather than leaving me on my own
covered in ketchup!

391
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,514
We're blood brothers,
or have you not remembered?

392
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:30,716
I had to go to a meeting!
It's our religion!

393
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:35,510
- Oh, my itchy blue beard.
- They made me go and it was all day!

394
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:38,956
- I'm not supposed to be your friend.
- What's wrong with me?

395
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,873
- I'm Plymouth Brethren.
- What is that supposed to mean?

396
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:44,269
- It's our religion.
- Bollocks, Will!

397
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:46,590
It's true.
If they find out we're friends,

398
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:49,831
I'll be in the worst trouble ever.

399
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,990
I didn't forget, Lee Carter.

400
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:55,675
They made me go.
I swear it, on my heart!

401
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:00,794
I'm not allowed to make the film
with you any more. It's forbidden.

402
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:03,553
Well, I didn't wanna make it with you,
anyway.

403
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:10,472
You, er, left your alarm clock in my
locker. You'd better go and get it.

404
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,278
OK.

405
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,756
Son of Rambo,

406
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:29,229
say, hello, to your new

407
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:31,231
flying dog.

408
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:33,356
- Did you make this?
- Yeah.

409
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,078
You made my flying dog!

410
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:37,549
We've got ten minutes before lessons.
Let's go.

411
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:41,951
- It looks just like my drawings!
- Alright, are you ready?

412
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:47,433
- Yep.
- OK. Three, two, one, go! Whoo-hoo!

413
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:55,355
Thank you, Lee Carter! It looks real!

414
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,670
Right, down, boy.

415
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,358
Non.

416
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:18,152
Thanks for coming.
Next, Lucy Rogers, monsieur.

417
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:26,270
Wait. Wait here, ladies.

418
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:30,673
- Do you want more Coke?
- Forget this.

419
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:34,036
- Forget this?
- Oui, forget this.

420
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:37,271
But there's lots more for you to
have a go on. I can get others.

421
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:40,989
<i>St Mary's is just down the road,
and they're all Catholic.</i>

422
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:51,990
He's bored. He's so bored.
I don't know what to do.

423
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:58,759
That... looks just like a flying dog.

424
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,709
Whoa! Whoa! Mind the trees!

425
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:14,956
- I can't control it!
- You're going towards the building!

426
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,951
- Hold on!
- I can't!

427
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:58,191
Carter! Don't you dare move,
you bally boy!

428
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:03,238
- Lee Carter!
- At least we got the shot.

429
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:06,232
Alright, skills. Get my camera
and put it in your locker.

430
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:10,029
Don't let anyone see you or you'll be
in deep shit. Catch up with you later.

431
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:12,509
You'll get in trouble.
You'll be tortured again!

432
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:14,431
Oh, don't worry. Just go.

433
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:19,832
Carter!

434
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,191
Where's my book?

435
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:28,477
This is great. It's amazing.

436
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:32,872
- Wow! He's gonna love it.
- Yeah. Yeah, I think he will.

437
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:41,315
- Lee Carter!
- Don't worry, it's a week's suspension.

438
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:44,996
Get in the car!

439
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:48,350
<i>Shut up! Get in the car.</i>

440
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:50,396
<i>Pipe down!</i>

441
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:55,316
<i>Sam Taylor-Wood,
I'll get you inside!</i>

442
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:59,391
<i>- Gonna miss your scabby little friend?
- Inside now!</i>

443
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,470
<i>That means you!</i>

444
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:05,358
<i>What?</i>

445
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,670
You said you were coming back
last week.

446
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:10,670
What? What?!

447
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:12,910
Look... Look, hold on a sec, Mum.

448
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,991
- Oi, it's Mum.
- Skill! Say hello for me.

449
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:17,116
He says hello. Hello back.

450
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,760
Now everyone's said hello,
when are you coming back

451
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:22,513
cos the place
is turning into a shit hole?

452
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,598
You live by the gun,

453
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,716
you die by the gun.

454
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:36,268
We are soldiers.

455
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:38,635
We know only to fight.

456
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:14,432
<i>I see a big light in the sky.</i>

457
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,998
Adieu.

458
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:32,511
You make movie?

459
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:36,193
To be star of movie is my dream,
my friend.

460
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:39,150

503
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:54,719
Stop.

He's from France, and he's an actor.
Aren't you?

506
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:05,034
- Yeah.
- My nose. Is it bleeding?

507
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:10,148
They want to be in our film. They're
on our side. Isn't that brilliant?

508
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:12,549
- Yeah, but they hate me.
- Not any more.

509
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:14,915
And Didier's a really amazing actor.

510
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,514
- It's gonna be skill!
- Skill?

511
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:20,831
- Yeah, skill!
- No.

512
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:23,673
It doesn't sound right
when you say things like me.

513
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:26,354

of saying stuff.

In this diagram, there are
20 small squares in each rectangle.

516
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:58,634
The diagram shows one quarter,
subtract one fifth.

517
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:01,518
Five squares, subtract four squares...

518
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,798
...equals one square, one twentieth.

519
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:08,678
This can be written as one quarter
subtract one fifth.

When I was your age,

I always used to walk past this bakery
on the way to prayer meeting.

One day I heard
the most wonderful music

coming from the radio inside,
and it really was like...

01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:03,958
like the sweetest hymn I'd ever heard.

<i>I couldn't get it out of my head.</i>

I always used to walk past hoping
to hear it again, but I never did.

567
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:14,477
<i>So I found a record player.</i>

568
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:16,437
I bought the song from a record shop,

569
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:18,954
and I had to hum the tune
to the salesman,

570
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:23,079
because I didn't know its name.
I couldn't wait to get it home.

- Well, let me in, then, you bastard!

615
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,077
I'll get in trouble if they see you.

616
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:55,993
Oh, for Chrissakes!
Look, I'm sorry, OK?

617
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:58,878
- Shh!
- Can't we just make the film?

618
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:01,633
Just you and me!
I've brought you a present.

619
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:04,678
- You'll wake my mum!
- It was better when it was just us two.

620
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:08,196
You said it was my film. Now you want
to ruin it, on the last day!

621
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:10,794
No, it's not you. It's them!
I hate them!

622
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:12,711
They're two-faced!

623
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:16,558
You know, I come all this way
just to say sorry.

624
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:19,950
I even brought you a present,
you ungrateful little bastard!

625
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:22,797
Wait! Will!

626
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:24,871
Wait! I didn't mean it!

627
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:31,079
<i>Shit!</i>

628
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:10,230
You look so tired, William.

629
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,036
What's he doing here?

630
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:21,759
Joshua's taking you away
for a few days.

631
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:24,551
Will!

632
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:29,238
William! William!

633
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:33,472
What is wrong with you, brother?
You are bringing shame on this family!

634
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:36,393
- Let go of me!
- It's over. You're coming with me now.

635
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:39,233
- You're not my dad!
- We're brethren!

636
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:42,118
I hate the Brethren! And I hate you!

637
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:44,634
<i>William! Stop!</i>

638
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:05,193
Wow!

639
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:08,158
<i>Thank goodness you're here!</i>

640
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:11,630
Guns are over there.
Scarecrow head's here.

641
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:13,915
You look lovely, ladies. Keep it up.

642
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,355
We're just about to get the car started.

643
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:18,954
Erm, is this alright, Will?

644
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:21,110
It's perfect. Get ready.

645
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:23,236
- Good morning, Didier.
- Good morning.

646
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:25,151
What are you doing? Get back to work.

647
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:28,391
<i>Yes! Well done, guys!</i>

648
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:30,675
<i>Is this alright, Will?</i>

649
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:33,558
- A bit more green paint.
- You heard him. Green paint!

650
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:35,949
<i>I've only got blue.</i>

651
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:40,798
Oi.
What's ze Wolf doing in my costume?

652
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:43,314
He's driving the jeep
for the getaway scene.

653
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:46,312
- I'm Trautman. I'm driving the jeep.
- You can't drive.

654
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:48,914
- It's a piece of piss.
- Don't be stupid.

655
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:54,717
Alright, then. Well, if I'm not needed,
I'll be taking my camera back, then.

656
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:56,836
- You promised!
- Yeah?

657
01:08:56,920 --> 01:08:59,718
What would you know about promises,
blood brother?

658
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:02,678
- Don't push it.
- Yeah? You need to grow up!

659
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:05,957
- You drew first blood.
- And you're a head case!

660
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:08,713
It's just a scab.
It doesn't mean anything.

661
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:10,711
It doesn't hurt!

662
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:16,711
Yeah?

663
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:19,314
Well, does that hurt? Huh?

664
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:22,435
<i>Fight! Fight! Fight!</i>

665
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:25,637
- Me and my brother will kill you lot!
- You're both scabs.

666
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:28,678
I dare any of you to say that
about my brother! I dare you!

667
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:31,354
<i>Fight! Fight! Fight!</i>

668
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:34,637
<i>Scab! Scab! Scab!
Scab! Scab! Scab! Scab!</i>

669
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:37,712
- Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
- Scab! Scab! Scab! Scab!

670
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:47,588
You and your brother are scabs!

671
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:53,198
<i>Scab! Scab! Scab!</i>

672
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:56,272
He's gone now! Let's make the movie!

673
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:03,718
Hurry up, people! We're losing light.

674
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:14,155
- Come on. This thing stinks.
- Sorry. OK. Ready?

675
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:17,710
Stand by, everybody! Stand by!

676
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:19,518
Action!

677
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:27,558
It looks brilliant!

678
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:36,475
Step on it, Trautman!
We're gonna save my dad!

679
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:40,754
- Argh!
- What's wrong?

680
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:49,118
Help!

681
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:54,910
Help! Help!

682
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,150
Help!

683
01:10:57,240 --> 01:10:59,595
Didier! Help!

684
01:11:06,040 --> 01:11:08,508
<i>Help!</i>

685
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:10,113
Help!

686
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:45,836
I don't care what you
and your so-called mates say about me,

687
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:48,753
but don't you ever,
ever call my brother a scab!

688
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:52,913
You know, at least he's there for me!
At least he cares about me,

689
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:56,197
which is more than I can say for you.
You're a two-faced fake

690
01:11:56,280 --> 01:11:59,511
like the rest of them. I'm gutted
it took me this long to work it out.

691
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:03,275
I'm gutted I fell for it. Lawrence
is better than all you lot put together,

692
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:05,920
and he's all I've got, alright?
He's all I've got.

693
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:09,788
<i>I didn't come back for you anyway.</i>

694
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:12,189
Where's my camera?

695
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:32,993
Lee Carter! Get out!

696
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:10,798
<i>William,
do you know where your friend lives?</i>

697
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:13,348
We need to contact his family.

698
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:51,237
- Sister Mary?
- Brother Joshua.

699
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:54,551
We've come to discuss your future
with the Brethren.

700
01:13:58,160 --> 01:14:01,072
Mary, I feel it best
to come straight to the point.

701
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:03,515
We've had a group meeting,

702
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:07,275
and it has been decided
that this must be your final warning.

703
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:09,669
If the boy isn't corrected,

704
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:13,992
I'm afraid you and the family
would face expulsion from the Brethren.

705
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:34,918
<i>I need to talk to you.</i>

706
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,150
It's just me. Please come out of there.

707
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:40,277
<i>I've spoilt everything!</i>

708
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:44,989
Everything's ruined!

709
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:49,310
Shh.

710
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:57,158
<i>Are they going to throw us out?</i>

711
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:01,516
Shh. Shh. Everything's alright.

712
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:20,954
I found a present in the garden.

713
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:17,116
<i>Bye! See you! Bye!</i>

714
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:27,878
Thanks.

715
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:29,871
Thanks.

716
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:36,789
Thanks. Thank you.

717
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:40,397
Thank you.

718
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,389
<i>- Bye! Au revoir!
- Bye.</i>

719
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:51,991
Didier.

720
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:06,554
<i>Bye! Bye!</i>

721
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,070
I'm sorry.

722
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:43,711
What's he saying?

723
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:47,190
- He said you're his brother.
- Look, this isn't my fault.

724
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:49,953
He just wants you
to take this home for him.

725
01:18:57,680 --> 01:18:59,716
Look at the state of it!

726
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:07,351
It's ruined.

727
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:10,477
He's been a very brave little boy,
Mr Carter.

728
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:27,073
<i>You did! I watched you do it!</i>

729
01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:29,720
<i>Mum, it's Lawrence.</i>

730
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:32,314
- Lawrence!
- You always get so violent!

731
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:35,073
Well, it's not a good time for me,
either!

732
01:19:35,160 --> 01:19:36,991
<i>What?</i>

733
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:40,311
What? Look, I can't even...

734
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:47,909
Get out of my car.

735
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,513
Out!

736
01:19:58,760 --> 01:20:01,957
<i>... the winner of
our young-filmmakers competition.</i>

737

738
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:09,113
<i>with our very hearty congratulations.
Thanks very much for that super film.</i>

739
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:11,998
<i>Jan will be presenting
the "Screen Test"...</i>

740
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:22,871
Not eating, William?

741
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:27,879
You should be thankful for what
your mother's cooked for you.

742
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:29,951
Would you like to get down, love?

743
01:20:30,040 --> 01:20:34,272
My mother wouldn't let me get down till
I'd finished everything on my plate.

744
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:43,353
Didn't the warning
mean anything to you, Mary?

745
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:46,512
You know what happens
if you don't teach him properly.

746
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:15,270
<i>Hurray!</i>

747
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:25,954
<i>...call my brother a scab.</i>

<i>Lawrence is better than all you lot...</i>

752
01:21:56,720 --> 01:21:58,870
This belongs to you.

753
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:17,911
Is it broken?

754
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:24,071
Can you fix it?

755
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:38,911
Cheer up, son. You're going home.

756
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:40,797
Exactly.

757
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:48,990
Here we are, then.

758
01:22:57,280 --> 01:22:59,350
What's this?

759
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:03,509
Better find out.

760
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:22,035
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,

<i>We're sure you will enjoy it.</i>

<i>It's a flying dog!</i>

770
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:10,678
<i>Duck! It's shooting at us!</i>

771
01:24:15,680 --> 01:24:17,591
<i>Let's split up.</i>

772
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:22,269
<i>OK.</i>

773
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:25,318
<i>They're firing at us! Take cover!</i>

774
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:27,595
<i>OK!</i>

775
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:41,235
<i>Who are you, sir?</i>

776
01:24:41,320 --> 01:24:44,153
<i>- Zey call me ze Wolf.
- I need to find my dad.</i>

777
01:24:44,240 --> 01:24:46,708
<i>I help you to find your daddy man.</i>

778
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:51,715
<i>I am the evil scarecrow! Prepare to die!</i>

779
01:24:57,160 --> 01:24:59,355
<i>- What?
- You killed the Wolf!</i>

780
01:24:59,440 --> 01:25:02,512
<i>He was a traitor.
I could see it was a trap,</i>

781
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:05,910
<i>- set by the evil scarecrow.
- Good work! I can't thank you enough.</i>

782
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:09,310
<i>You save your father.
I'll get the chopper so we can escape.</i>

783
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:15,793
<i>I've come to save you, Rambo!</i>

784
01:25:15,880 --> 01:25:19,714
<i>We need to leave here right now,
before the evil scarecrow finds us!</i>

785
01:25:20,760 --> 01:25:23,149
<i>Come on, Dad! Come on!</i>

786
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:33,712
<i>Er... you win, Son of Rambo.
Do me one favour before you go.</i>

787
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:35,552
<i>What?</i>

788
01:25:37,880 --> 01:25:42,317
<i>- Tell my brother I was thinking of him.
- I didn't know you had a brother.</i>

789
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:45,949
<i>Er, yes.
Colonel Trautman, he's my brother.</i>

790
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:47,519
<i>Yes, he is.</i>

791
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:49,591
<i>And when you see my brother,</i>

792
01:25:49,680 --> 01:25:54,629
<i>tell him I'm sorry... that I haven't
been there for him and that, yeah?</i>

793
01:25:54,720 --> 01:25:58,599
<i>And say that I know we haven't been
much of a family and all that, but...</i>

794
01:25:58,680 --> 01:26:01,752
<i>but he's all I've got, too.</i>

795
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:04,957
<i>- God bless you, Evil Scarecrow.
- Yeah, alright.</i>

796
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:07,235
<i>Let me die in peace, will you?</i>

797
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:15,590
<i>Dad, I'm going home.
There's a friend I've got to be with.</i>

798
01:26:21,080 --> 01:26:25,278
<i>O my God, I've come
to say thank you for your love today.</i>

799
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:28,955
<i>Thank you for my family
and all the friends you give to me.</i>

800
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:33,192
<i>Guard me in the dark of night,
and in the morning, send your light.</i>

801
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:36,272
<i>Amen.</i>

802
01:26:54,360 --> 01:26:56,351
Hello, Lee Carter.

803
01:26:56,440 --> 01:26:59,352
<i>My brother is the worst actor ever.</i>

804
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:01,795
<i>He is pretty bad.</i>

805
01:27:01,880 --> 01:27:05,111
Yeah. He's even worse
than that bloody French kid.

806
01:27:05,200 --> 01:27:08,317
<i>We'd better go.</i>

807
01:27:09,320 --> 01:27:11,038
Yeah.

808
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:18,312
Thanks.

809
01:27:19,680 --> 01:27:22,069
- Son of Rambo?
- Yes, Colonel?

810
01:27:22,160 --> 01:27:25,038
This has been my best day of all time.

811

<i># I've waited hours for this</i>

820

821

<i># Before you're here</i>

822
01:28:58,400 --> 01:29:01,198
<i># I make the shapes
come much too close</i>

823
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:04,556
<i># I pull my eyes out,
hold my breath and wait</i>

824
01:29:04,640 --> 01:29:08,713
<i># Until I shake</i>

825
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:11,234
<i># But if I had your face</i>

826
01:29:11,320 --> 01:29:14,596
<i># Then I could make it safe and clean</i>

827

<i># Oh, if only I was sure</i>

828

you spelt the title slightly wrong.</i>

842
01:31:12,040 --> 01:31:14,793
