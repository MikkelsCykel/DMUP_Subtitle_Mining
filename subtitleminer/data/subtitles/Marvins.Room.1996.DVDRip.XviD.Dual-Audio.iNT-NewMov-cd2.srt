1
00:00:08,354 --> 00:00:10,083
I'm putting this with your things.

2
00:00:11,357 --> 00:00:11,846
Why?

3
00:00:13,459 --> 00:00:14,426
Because they're yours.

4
00:00:22,068 --> 00:00:24,298
You're my nephew and I love you.

5
00:00:24,971 --> 00:00:26,165
No matter what you've decided.

6
00:00:32,745 --> 00:00:33,507
Good night.

7
00:00:46,025 --> 00:00:48,493
Don't waste time making friends
with him.

8
00:00:48,628 --> 00:00:49,925
We're only here a few days.

9
00:01:03,776 --> 00:01:07,075
We're starting a procedure to
look for a match.

10
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:09,614
Please, Bob. I'll take this.

11
00:01:10,983 --> 00:01:12,974
We're starting a procedure to
look for a match.

12
00:01:13,953 --> 00:01:14,578
Questions?

13
00:01:15,288 --> 00:01:16,220
How big is the needle?

14
00:01:18,624 --> 00:01:20,524
It's not important that you
understand.

15
00:01:20,626 --> 00:01:22,093
Bob.

16
00:01:22,195 --> 00:01:24,060
Follow me, please.

17
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,794
Are you fixing the door for Ruth?

18
00:01:30,369 --> 00:01:32,234
It's so boring.
There's nothing else to do.

19
00:01:33,005 --> 00:01:34,131
Want to keep me company?

20
00:01:35,775 --> 00:01:36,434
Sure.

21
00:01:41,881 --> 00:01:42,609
It's a Ford, huh?

22
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,947
Would you like to drive?

23
00:01:46,686 --> 00:01:47,414
Are you sure?

24
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,179
Yes

25
00:01:48,321 --> 00:01:49,879
You want me to drive?

26
00:01:50,022 --> 00:01:52,047
It's okay, you can drive.

27
00:01:52,191 --> 00:01:54,159
I'm fast, I'm warning you.

28
00:01:55,294 --> 00:01:56,761
Be careful. Don't go too fast.

29
00:02:11,577 --> 00:02:12,839
You're a natural born driver.

30
00:02:16,515 --> 00:02:18,039
I have an idea where we can go!

31
00:02:18,885 --> 00:02:19,579
Turn here.

32
00:02:29,362 --> 00:02:30,021
Do you know my dad?

33
00:02:30,863 --> 00:02:31,591
I met him once.

34
00:02:33,099 --> 00:02:34,225
Doesn't your mom talk about him?

35
00:02:35,468 --> 00:02:35,957
No.

36
00:02:36,936 --> 00:02:42,841
I know your mom war nuts
about him.

37
00:02:45,278 --> 00:02:45,937
Did you go to the wedding?

38
00:02:46,412 --> 00:02:46,969
No.

39
00:02:48,014 --> 00:02:51,780
I knew I war going to be down
here with Dad and Ruth

40
00:02:51,884 --> 00:02:54,751
so I went back home to sell
the rest of my stuff.

41
00:02:56,489 --> 00:02:58,389
Did they have you over for dinner

42
00:02:58,491 --> 00:03:03,258
No, it wasn't much of a visit.
I just stopped by.

43
00:03:03,362 --> 00:03:07,389
Your dad was asleep,
and Lee didn't want to wake him

44
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,697
so we stood in the hallway
and talked a while.

45
00:03:12,371 --> 00:03:14,236
Your dad was still asleep
when I left.

46
00:03:16,742 --> 00:03:17,504
How'd he seem?

47
00:03:22,348 --> 00:03:23,713
He seemed nice enough.

48
00:03:46,906 --> 00:03:47,668
What?

49
00:04:53,472 --> 00:04:54,769
We ware just down by the water.

50
00:04:58,244 --> 00:04:58,801
I'm sorry.

51
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,242
Dr. Wally called.

52
00:05:03,649 --> 00:05:06,049
He'd like to test the boys next.

53
00:05:27,006 --> 00:05:29,201
Dad, what's Wrong?

54
00:05:29,775 --> 00:05:30,935
No, Dad, it's just us.

55
00:05:46,725 --> 00:05:47,487
You awake?

56
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:53,831
You might be afraid about this
procedure

57
00:05:53,933 --> 00:05:57,960
but I hear it's like having
a tooth pulled.

58
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,867
I'm not afraid,
I just haven't decided yet.

59
00:06:02,508 --> 00:06:03,600
You'll have the test!

60
00:06:04,844 --> 00:06:10,680
My sister is not going to die
so you can have one of your moods

61
00:06:21,727 --> 00:06:22,591
Correct me if I'm wrong,

62
00:06:23,028 --> 00:06:29,456
but leukemia that's a disease
they've worked out, right?

63
00:06:29,568 --> 00:06:30,159
That is wrong.

64
00:06:30,269 --> 00:06:31,930
What'll happen to my sister?

65
00:06:32,338 --> 00:06:34,306
On the chance you can't
find a donor?

66
00:06:39,345 --> 00:06:40,039
Why don't you sit down?

67
00:06:44,717 --> 00:06:47,015
Without a bone marrow transplant,

68
00:06:47,119 --> 00:06:49,212
we rely on chemical therapies,
chemotherapy,

69
00:06:49,355 --> 00:06:55,453
as a way of sustaining the
patient over a number of years.

70
00:06:56,061 --> 00:06:56,823
What kind of a number... 10?

71
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:00,962
A lower number.

72
00:07:03,169 --> 00:07:03,897
Nice?

73
00:07:05,171 --> 00:07:06,103
A much lower number.

74
00:07:08,574 --> 00:07:12,066
As the immune system suffers
under chemotherapy

75
00:07:12,178 --> 00:07:19,482
she'll grow weaker and could
have respiratory problems.

76
00:07:19,585 --> 00:07:24,113
She may be bedridden, totally
dependent hopelessly depressed.

77
00:07:24,256 --> 00:07:27,020
You'll need a nurse to help you.

78
00:07:27,126 --> 00:07:28,718
Help me, what?

79
00:07:28,861 --> 00:07:32,922
Your sister your father
and your aunt.

80
00:07:35,067 --> 00:07:36,056
I'm not doing any.

81
00:07:37,069 --> 00:07:38,058
Why'd you think that?

82
00:07:39,338 --> 00:07:40,032
I assumed.

83
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:41,766
No. I live in Ohio.

84
00:07:41,874 --> 00:07:43,535
I just got a degree
in cosmetology.

85
00:07:44,376 --> 00:07:45,570
She's going to be fine.

86
00:07:52,084 --> 00:07:53,574
Yes.

87
00:07:57,356 --> 00:08:04,194
How can one sister be so good
and the other so bad?

88
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:09,367
So, you're saying Coral is good
and Amber's bad?

89
00:08:10,336 --> 00:08:12,531
Coral Used to be bad.

90
00:08:13,105 --> 00:08:17,201
But she's been a saint ever since
her car accident.

91
00:08:18,644 --> 00:08:20,669
That Volvo was a blessing.

92
00:08:38,664 --> 00:08:39,892
I bet they have good care here.

93
00:08:41,467 --> 00:08:43,401
Dad never put Mom in a home.

94
00:08:45,237 --> 00:08:46,226
Remember how he cared for her?

95
00:08:46,772 --> 00:08:48,467
I was little.
I wasn't allowed in the room.

96
00:08:55,014 --> 00:08:56,311
I get my degree next quarter.

97
00:08:56,815 --> 00:08:58,373
You should be proud of that.

98
00:08:58,984 --> 00:09:00,417
I already did a freelance job.

99
00:09:01,253 --> 00:09:03,050
I did hair for a local
TV commercial.

100
00:09:03,188 --> 00:09:04,587
Guess what it paid?

101
00:09:05,591 --> 00:09:07,923
I don't feel like guessing.
Guess.

102
00:09:09,595 --> 00:09:10,220
300 dollars?

103
00:09:15,501 --> 00:09:16,900
Right. Why'd you guess that?

104
00:09:17,403 --> 00:09:18,529
It popped in my head.

105
00:09:18,837 --> 00:09:20,270
Most people would guess lower.

106
00:09:20,973 --> 00:09:22,440
$300 is a lot of money.

107
00:09:23,676 --> 00:09:26,110
I fell like my life is finally
starting.

108
00:09:28,914 --> 00:09:29,642
Ladies.

109
00:09:32,518 --> 00:09:34,213
What a beautiful room.

110
00:09:35,354 --> 00:09:36,548
Wouldn't Ruth love this?

111
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:39,214
This place gives me the creeps.

112
00:09:39,358 --> 00:09:40,655
Marry me, Coral.

113
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:43,922
I want to be your wife.

114
00:09:44,029 --> 00:09:44,996
Do you mean it?

115
00:09:45,097 --> 00:09:46,394
I'll drop the charges.

116
00:09:46,498 --> 00:09:49,023
What's Coral up to today?

117
00:09:49,134 --> 00:09:53,161
I'm going to show you something
that we're proud of.

118
00:09:53,272 --> 00:09:56,867
Out state-of-the-art physical
therapy room.

119
00:09:57,876 --> 00:09:58,535
Right over here.

120
00:10:01,547 --> 00:10:04,277
I wouldn't mind living here.
Great!

121
00:10:05,084 --> 00:10:06,745
Isn't it? Hello, Doctor.

122
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:17,228
We have a full range of
activities computer games,

123
00:10:17,329 --> 00:10:21,993
video library, sing-alongs Nerf
basketball, date nights.

124
00:10:22,101 --> 00:10:23,898
Who's Dad going to date?

125
00:10:24,002 --> 00:10:27,870
You'd be surprised.
Women outnumber men here 5 to 1.

126
00:10:27,973 --> 00:10:30,441
I don't think we can afford
such a nice place.

127
00:10:31,009 --> 00:10:34,638
If you drop to a lower income
bracket you get financial aid.

128
00:10:34,747 --> 00:10:35,714
Lower?

129
00:10:35,814 --> 00:10:38,146
70% of our residents qualified

130
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:42,516
for assistance by spending
their savings on something

131
00:10:42,654 --> 00:10:44,519
hat has no resale value.

132
00:10:44,623 --> 00:10:45,282
Lower?

133
00:10:45,424 --> 00:10:46,618
What do they buy?

134
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:49,319
Most buy elaborate tombstones.

135
00:10:51,096 --> 00:10:52,063
I'm going to wait in the car.

136
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,893
Do you have something
I can take with me?

137
00:10:58,237 --> 00:10:58,931
Of course.

138
00:11:16,889 --> 00:11:18,288
Can't you take Dad and Ruth?

139
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:18,913
I don't think so.

140
00:11:19,057 --> 00:11:21,082
You could move here.

141
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,785
I got Hank to think about.

142
00:11:22,928 --> 00:11:24,259
He's unhappy there!

143
00:11:24,596 --> 00:11:27,121
If he were happy
he wouldn't be there.

144
00:11:27,232 --> 00:11:28,699
Transfer him!

145
00:11:28,801 --> 00:11:33,363
You find a place for him here!
You could have the house!

146
00:11:33,472 --> 00:11:35,099
You could find work down here!

147
00:11:35,207 --> 00:11:36,105
No.

148
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:36,765
Why not?

149
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:38,900
Just... no.

150
00:11:39,011 --> 00:11:40,273
Give me one good reason!

151
00:11:40,379 --> 00:11:41,573
I don't want to!

152
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,942
I decided this before.

153
00:11:43,048 --> 00:11:45,949
When Dad had his stoke,
I chose not to waste my life.

154
00:11:46,051 --> 00:11:48,542
You think I've wasted my life?

155
00:11:48,687 --> 00:11:50,018
Of course not.

156
00:11:50,155 --> 00:11:52,487
I can't imagine a better way
to have spent it.

157
00:11:52,591 --> 00:11:53,819
Then we made the right decision.

158
00:11:53,959 --> 00:11:55,256
What decision?

159
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,794
Dad got sick, I came to help.
You didn't.

160
00:11:57,896 --> 00:12:00,831
I had plans, a husband.
I couldn't!

161
00:12:00,933 --> 00:12:02,161
You didn't!

162
00:12:02,267 --> 00:12:06,033
You think I didn't have plans?!
You're the most.

163
00:12:06,939 --> 00:12:07,735
Say it!

164
00:12:09,241 --> 00:12:11,539
You've said it a million ways
since I came.

165
00:12:11,643 --> 00:12:14,612
Leave her alone! Why are you
yelling at her?

166
00:12:14,713 --> 00:12:16,374
She wants to tell you
I'm terrible.

167
00:12:16,482 --> 00:12:18,950
I've tried to be nice
since you came.

168
00:12:19,051 --> 00:12:23,044
You're think she's being nice
suddenly

169
00:12:23,188 --> 00:12:27,124
because she felt an urge?

170
00:12:27,259 --> 00:12:29,227
Shut up!

171
00:12:29,328 --> 00:12:31,421
Did you ever get a gift from her?

172
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:34,658
I thought about you all the time.

173
00:12:34,766 --> 00:12:35,960
How about a card?!

174
00:12:36,068 --> 00:12:37,626
Ever get a card form Bessie?!

175
00:12:37,736 --> 00:12:39,328
We were not close!

176
00:12:39,438 --> 00:12:41,065
You didn't speak to me
for 20 years!

177
00:12:41,173 --> 00:12:43,471
You've got to care of your family

178
00:12:43,575 --> 00:12:45,008
I took care of my family!

179
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:47,977
I raised two kids,
never heard from you!

180
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,412
I am finally getting my life
together,

181
00:12:50,516 --> 00:12:52,507
nobody's going to take it away!

182
00:12:52,618 --> 00:12:54,142
I can't wait to get out of here.

183
00:13:05,297 --> 00:13:07,026
Thanks for helping me.

184
00:13:07,132 --> 00:13:09,828
It's a lot to ask of you
to donate bone marrow.

185
00:13:09,935 --> 00:13:12,301
I think it sound neat.

186
00:13:12,404 --> 00:13:15,669
Your medical history care,
please?

187
00:13:15,774 --> 00:13:19,733
Your medical history card,
please.

188
00:13:22,814 --> 00:13:24,645
Now, Hank.

189
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:25,944
I'm Charlie.

190
00:13:26,051 --> 00:13:27,109
I'm Doctor Wally.

191
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:33,223
You have to fill out one too.

192
00:13:33,825 --> 00:13:35,292
He's not here to get the test.

193
00:13:35,894 --> 00:13:36,451
Okay.

194
00:13:53,478 --> 00:13:55,844
Am I reading your card correctly

195
00:13:55,948 --> 00:13:57,916
Are you currently on lithium?

196
00:13:58,016 --> 00:13:59,244
Yeah.

197
00:13:59,351 --> 00:14:01,444
Isn't it a great drug?

198
00:14:02,788 --> 00:14:06,485
Can I ask you something did you
gain weight since?

199
00:14:07,793 --> 00:14:08,555
No.

200
00:14:20,472 --> 00:14:21,268
Nervous?

201
00:14:22,174 --> 00:14:22,868
No.

202
00:14:26,411 --> 00:14:26,934
Thank you.

203
00:14:29,348 --> 00:14:31,942
These offices used to be
infested with bugs.

204
00:14:34,753 --> 00:14:35,811
Bugs don't bother me.

205
00:14:36,355 --> 00:14:36,844
No?

206
00:14:37,723 --> 00:14:42,387
They crawl out the boys' shower
drain hide

207
00:14:42,494 --> 00:14:45,930
in the auto shop junk pile
and float in the basins.

208
00:14:46,031 --> 00:14:46,861
You get used to it.

209
00:14:46,965 --> 00:14:47,590
I wouldn't.

210
00:14:47,699 --> 00:14:54,263
This one dude he catches bugs
and puts them on a leash.

211
00:14:54,373 --> 00:14:55,431
A leash?

212
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,131
A hair leash.

213
00:14:56,241 --> 00:14:58,607
He ties a hair to the bug and
tacks it down under his bunk.

214
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:04,945
He had a zoo of bugs walking in
circles all over the place.

215
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:09,510
My friend grabbed his cafeteria
tray and smashed them all!

216
00:15:12,024 --> 00:15:12,991
That was funny.

217
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:14,683
Why make up these stories?

218
00:15:16,828 --> 00:15:17,522
What do you mean?

219
00:15:17,863 --> 00:15:22,027
Razors under the tongue,
hair leashes.

220
00:15:22,134 --> 00:15:22,759
It's not made up.

221
00:15:22,868 --> 00:15:24,301
Pretending you weren't
getting tested?

222
00:15:24,403 --> 00:15:27,065
Think I'm lying about that?

223
00:15:27,606 --> 00:15:28,937
Fine, you win! I'm lying!

224
00:15:40,719 --> 00:15:42,448
I haven't told you shit!

225
00:15:42,587 --> 00:15:44,248
You don't know about it!

226
00:15:44,389 --> 00:15:44,912
Tell me!

227
00:15:45,057 --> 00:15:49,858
You don't know!

228
00:15:49,961 --> 00:15:51,326
I was in the hospital.

229
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:54,365
I hated it! I was scared!

230
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:00,132
There's this dude.

231
00:16:00,238 --> 00:16:02,729
If this is another tale
I'm not interested.

232
00:16:06,511 --> 00:16:08,411
I'm going inside to see
if Charlie's done.

233
00:16:32,904 --> 00:16:35,839
I played in a pool tournament
in my ward.

234
00:16:35,941 --> 00:16:36,873
Mom tell you that?

235
00:16:36,975 --> 00:16:39,136
No.

236
00:16:39,945 --> 00:16:41,037
I came in fourth.

237
00:16:43,482 --> 00:16:44,107
It's true.

238
00:16:45,584 --> 00:16:47,245
She doesn't think it's a big deal

239
00:16:47,853 --> 00:16:48,717
That's great.

240
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:53,382
Got my toe broken in there.

241
00:16:53,525 --> 00:16:54,958
How?

242
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:57,494
This guy threw a garbage
can on my foot.

243
00:16:57,596 --> 00:16:59,461
Why'd he do that?

244
00:16:59,965 --> 00:17:00,932
No reason I know of.

245
00:17:06,071 --> 00:17:07,834
There's a lot of drugs that float
around there.

246
00:17:08,874 --> 00:17:09,670
Do you take them?

247
00:17:12,477 --> 00:17:14,138
Most of the time
I just keep to myself.

248
00:17:17,082 --> 00:17:21,143
I think of what it would be like
to be someone else.

249
00:17:23,021 --> 00:17:25,387
Like I could have a house with
land around it

250
00:17:26,658 --> 00:17:30,116
and have dogs around and build
a go cart track.

251
00:17:31,029 --> 00:17:34,260
Those places make so much money.
Be raking that stuff in.

252
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,702
And nobody would know where I was

253
00:17:41,506 --> 00:17:42,200
Just be gone.

254
00:17:46,111 --> 00:17:49,342
Mostly I just think about
being someplace else.

255
00:17:50,115 --> 00:17:51,173
Then why aren't you?

256
00:17:53,018 --> 00:17:53,882
Why don't you go?

257
00:17:54,686 --> 00:17:55,243
What?

258
00:17:55,854 --> 00:17:57,617
You said people do what they want

259
00:17:58,190 --> 00:17:58,713
Yeah.

260
00:17:58,857 --> 00:17:59,824
So.

261
00:17:59,925 --> 00:18:01,256
You must want to be there.

262
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:02,587
No!

263
00:18:02,694 --> 00:18:04,218
Then show them you don't.

264
00:18:04,896 --> 00:18:05,828
It's not easy.

265
00:18:05,931 --> 00:18:07,990
I don't want you wasting
your life.

266
00:18:08,099 --> 00:18:09,031
Neither do I.

267
00:18:09,134 --> 00:18:10,066
Why are you there?

268
00:18:10,168 --> 00:18:11,260
Because they put me there!

269
00:18:11,369 --> 00:18:12,028
Why?

270
00:18:12,137 --> 00:18:13,536
I burned down the house!

271
00:18:13,638 --> 00:18:15,299
Why did you burn down the house?

272
00:18:18,243 --> 00:18:22,577
Come inside while we get
Charlie some juice.

273
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:32,850
Would you come?

274
00:18:35,594 --> 00:18:36,561
Sure I would.

275
00:19:02,254 --> 00:19:03,721
I forgot my coffee.

276
00:19:06,091 --> 00:19:07,217
Why coffee so late?

277
00:19:09,194 --> 00:19:10,627
I don't know. I like it.

278
00:19:13,265 --> 00:19:14,061
You have a way with Hank.

279
00:19:15,667 --> 00:19:16,497
I don't

280
00:19:17,369 --> 00:19:18,597
Yeah, you do.

281
00:19:20,405 --> 00:19:21,372
He's a good boy.

282
00:19:24,743 --> 00:19:25,835
Is he?

283
00:19:25,944 --> 00:19:26,968
Sure he is.

284
00:19:27,479 --> 00:19:29,743
I wish I knew your secret.

285
00:19:31,182 --> 00:19:32,979
I don't know. I just talk to him.

286
00:19:33,084 --> 00:19:34,381
You saying I don't?

287
00:19:38,089 --> 00:19:40,649
I'm tired and we've got Disney
World tomorrow.

288
00:19:54,806 --> 00:19:57,001
I can fix that wig for you.

289
00:19:57,108 --> 00:19:57,870
Does it look bad?

290
00:19:57,976 --> 00:19:59,238
No.

291
00:20:00,011 --> 00:20:04,573
But if you have a wig you should
try to have fun with it,

292
00:20:04,683 --> 00:20:05,615
try different looks.

293
00:20:08,553 --> 00:20:11,147
Something sporty,
out on the town kind of thing.

294
00:20:13,158 --> 00:20:14,022
I just brush it.

295
00:20:15,026 --> 00:20:16,516
I also have my whole makeup kit.

296
00:20:18,697 --> 00:20:19,425
Want to see?

297
00:20:20,699 --> 00:20:23,429
This is a really great
night cream.

298
00:20:24,169 --> 00:20:26,330
I never bothered much with makeup

299
00:20:27,072 --> 00:20:27,663
You should.

300
00:20:29,641 --> 00:20:35,045
Because it's fun and you might
meet somebody.

301
00:20:35,413 --> 00:20:37,973
Goodness, I haven't thought
about a man in years.

302
00:20:39,617 --> 00:20:40,447
You're lying.

303
00:20:47,726 --> 00:20:50,194
I'm sorry we haven't seen eye
to eye.

304
00:20:50,328 --> 00:20:51,920
I don't want to fight.

305
00:20:52,797 --> 00:20:53,729
We haven't been.

306
00:20:54,265 --> 00:20:55,232
I want to get along.

307
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:56,163
We do.

308
00:20:56,267 --> 00:21:01,432
I don't want us to just get along
be polite.

309
00:21:01,539 --> 00:21:05,236
I don't have any problem
with that.

310
00:21:13,284 --> 00:21:15,252
Nothing much seems important
to me now.

311
00:21:19,557 --> 00:21:20,455
We're sisters.

312
00:21:27,098 --> 00:21:28,065
Shouldn't we?

313
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:30,634
No, he just startles himself
sometimes,

314
00:21:30,735 --> 00:21:31,963
then goes back to sleep.

315
00:21:41,613 --> 00:21:42,580
Are you seeing anybody now?

316
00:21:43,114 --> 00:21:43,842
Usually.

317
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:47,008
I hope you have someone real
in your life.

318
00:21:47,452 --> 00:21:49,647
I don't have any trouble
with that.

319
00:21:49,788 --> 00:21:52,450
I'm not talking about that.

320
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:55,855
You should. There's no reason
you haven't had love.

321
00:21:56,194 --> 00:21:57,718
I had a true love.

322
00:21:57,862 --> 00:21:59,762
You did?

323
00:21:59,864 --> 00:22:00,796
Yes.

324
00:22:00,899 --> 00:22:02,366
Did he know?

325
00:22:02,467 --> 00:22:04,935
Yeah.

326
00:22:05,036 --> 00:22:06,333
Why didn't I know?

327
00:22:06,438 --> 00:22:07,905
He wasn't someone you'd know.

328
00:22:10,542 --> 00:22:13,568
Come on, I won't tell anyone.

329
00:22:14,846 --> 00:22:15,835
Clarence James.

330
00:22:19,317 --> 00:22:19,976
Who?

331
00:22:20,819 --> 00:22:22,650
He was only here during summers.

332
00:22:23,888 --> 00:22:26,755
My God! You went
with a carny worker!

333
00:22:26,858 --> 00:22:28,052
A very nice person!

334
00:22:28,193 --> 00:22:30,058
I didn't say anything.

335
00:22:30,161 --> 00:22:31,788
That's why I kept it secret.

336
00:22:31,896 --> 00:22:35,127
Which one was he?

337
00:22:35,533 --> 00:22:38,195
He mostly ran the ferris wheel.

338
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,908
Yeah, I remember him.
He was cute.

339
00:22:44,008 --> 00:22:47,569
He had the funniest laugh.

340
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:51,513
He'd open his mouth wide and
no sound would come out.

341
00:23:00,592 --> 00:23:01,889
No sound would come out!

342
00:23:07,966 --> 00:23:10,264
What happened?

343
00:23:11,703 --> 00:23:13,637
You know, they'd have that
last picnic?

344
00:23:14,572 --> 00:23:15,504
Down by the river?

345
00:23:16,641 --> 00:23:18,666
Clarence goes swimming,

346
00:23:18,776 --> 00:23:22,610
everyone's watching him
and everybody's there.

347
00:23:22,714 --> 00:23:27,048
His family, his friends, and me.

348
00:23:29,387 --> 00:23:34,689
He's laughing.
He's making that monkey face.

349
00:23:38,663 --> 00:23:42,099
It gets us laughing.
Then he dunks under the water.

350
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,633
He pops up again,

351
00:23:43,735 --> 00:23:46,829
and he's laughing even harder
and dives again

352
00:23:46,938 --> 00:23:49,498
and he doesn't come up
and he doesn't come up

353
00:23:50,208 --> 00:23:51,368
and he doesn't come up.

354
00:23:57,081 --> 00:23:58,105
What?

355
00:24:01,686 --> 00:24:04,553
Laughing and choking looked
the same on Clarence.

356
00:24:06,257 --> 00:24:06,951
He drowned.

357
00:24:12,964 --> 00:24:16,695
Oh, God, we were just standing
there watching.

358
00:24:18,736 --> 00:24:21,296
Oh, my God!

359
00:24:23,741 --> 00:24:25,675
And you never told me.

360
00:24:26,177 --> 00:24:29,408
If I couldn't say I had a carny
boyfriend,

361
00:24:29,514 --> 00:24:31,675
I couldn't say my carny
boyfriend drowned.

362
00:24:31,783 --> 00:24:33,148
You should have told me.

363
00:24:33,952 --> 00:24:34,976
We weren't that close.

364
00:24:37,922 --> 00:24:38,854
We weren't?

365
00:24:41,392 --> 00:24:42,188
No.

366
00:24:54,172 --> 00:24:55,503
Shall I fix that wig?

367
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:56,834
What?

368
00:24:57,242 --> 00:24:57,833
I don't know.

369
00:24:58,743 --> 00:24:59,437
Let me see it.

370
00:25:00,378 --> 00:25:01,538
Here.

371
00:25:01,646 --> 00:25:02,510
No, you got to take it off.

372
00:25:07,118 --> 00:25:07,982
I won't hurt it.

373
00:25:10,755 --> 00:25:11,221
Here.

374
00:25:12,457 --> 00:25:13,355
It's a good wig.

375
00:25:14,158 --> 00:25:16,922
Nicely ventilated.
We can do something with this.

376
00:25:17,028 --> 00:25:18,518
You want me to?

377
00:25:19,597 --> 00:25:20,564
Yeah, sure.

378
00:25:29,307 --> 00:25:30,535
It's a good weave.

379
00:25:33,745 --> 00:25:37,272
I'm glad we made this trip.
I wish we could stay longer.

380
00:25:37,615 --> 00:25:38,377
I'll get my brush.

381
00:25:59,137 --> 00:25:59,831
I found it.

382
00:27:34,198 --> 00:27:35,927
Is that too much wind for you,
Hank?

383
00:27:37,235 --> 00:27:37,963
What?

384
00:27:38,503 --> 00:27:39,401
Is that too much wind?

385
00:27:40,471 --> 00:27:41,096
NO, it's okay.

386
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:46,203
Stick your hand out the window,
Charlie.

387
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:48,870
It's like an airplane.

388
00:28:27,118 --> 00:28:27,743
Here we go!

389
00:28:29,187 --> 00:28:30,484
Faster!

390
00:28:30,855 --> 00:28:33,050
Charlie, faster, faster!

391
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:43,632
Charlie, slow down!

392
00:28:46,003 --> 00:28:48,631
We'll meet by Pirates of
the Caribbean in an hour.

393
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,470
Where the line starts.

394
00:28:52,176 --> 00:28:53,108
Bye.

395
00:29:09,126 --> 00:29:09,854
Oh, God.

396
00:29:18,703 --> 00:29:20,967
This Swiss Family tree house
is huge.

397
00:29:29,313 --> 00:29:30,541
I'm really proud of you,

398
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:33,849
Hank for getting tested
for Bessie.

399
00:29:40,758 --> 00:29:41,622
You're disgusting.

400
00:29:48,132 --> 00:29:50,032
You want me to push Aunt Ruth
a while?

401
00:29:50,134 --> 00:29:51,260
I like pushing her.

402
00:29:51,369 --> 00:29:53,428
He's a good driver.

403
00:29:53,538 --> 00:29:56,530
I'll catch up.
I'm going to sit in the sun.

404
00:29:57,041 --> 00:29:58,201
All right. Bye-bye.

405
00:29:58,776 --> 00:30:00,243
Hold on, let' go.

406
00:30:07,818 --> 00:30:09,683
Pick out something nice
for Bessie.

407
00:30:10,555 --> 00:30:12,489
How about my bone marrow?
Think she'd like that?

408
00:30:15,259 --> 00:30:16,191
Look!

409
00:30:16,861 --> 00:30:18,488
"Love Bug."Remember?

410
00:30:19,063 --> 00:30:21,088
We saw it on TV together.

411
00:30:21,198 --> 00:30:22,062
No.

412
00:30:22,166 --> 00:30:25,499
I remember Dad took me to see
"Indiana Jones," though.

413
00:30:26,437 --> 00:30:29,770
You're doing well on this trip.
Sort of. Stop it.

414
00:30:31,375 --> 00:30:32,433
Tomorrow when we go back,

415
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:35,071
everyone'll hear about how well
you did.

416
00:30:35,179 --> 00:30:36,407
Stop it!

417
00:30:36,514 --> 00:30:38,778
I'm not going back.
I'm staying with Bessie.

418
00:30:48,593 --> 00:30:50,857
"Peter Pan."
That was a cute movie.

419
00:30:51,529 --> 00:30:52,962
I saw it with Dad.

420
00:30:53,464 --> 00:30:54,192
No, you didn't.

421
00:31:38,509 --> 00:31:39,908
Dad never hit me.

422
00:31:40,611 --> 00:31:41,441
He did.

423
00:31:41,545 --> 00:31:42,671
I would remember that!

424
00:31:43,147 --> 00:31:44,512
You were 4 years old.

425
00:31:44,615 --> 00:31:46,981
You're the one who fought
with him!

426
00:31:47,084 --> 00:31:48,779
Yeah. But he hit you.

427
00:31:53,958 --> 00:32:02,457
My feelings for you are like
big bowl of fish hooks.

428
00:32:03,567 --> 00:32:05,967
I can't just pick one up
at a time,

429
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:08,595
I pick one up and they all come

430
00:32:08,706 --> 00:32:10,037
so I just tend to leave them
alone.

431
00:32:13,144 --> 00:32:13,803
You're a liar.

432
00:33:43,334 --> 00:33:43,993
What happened?

433
00:33:44,401 --> 00:33:45,060
I fainted.

434
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:46,962
There was blood in my mouth.

435
00:33:47,671 --> 00:33:48,899
Is your mouth still bleeding?

436
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,667
No.

437
00:33:51,909 --> 00:33:52,807
Did a doctor look at me?

438
00:33:53,244 --> 00:33:53,903
No,

439
00:33:54,245 --> 00:33:57,612
he thought you fainted so he
carried you here to lie down.

440
00:33:57,715 --> 00:33:59,342
Who's he?

441
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:01,611
Goofy.

442
00:34:01,719 --> 00:34:02,947
Goofy?

443
00:34:03,087 --> 00:34:04,349
Yeah.

444
00:34:04,488 --> 00:34:06,479
Goofy carried me to Mickey's
house?

445
00:34:06,624 --> 00:34:08,990
Yeah.

446
00:34:12,129 --> 00:34:14,461
He didn't know you were bleeding.

447
00:34:14,565 --> 00:34:18,399
Maybe you felt faint because you
haven't been eating.

448
00:34:18,803 --> 00:34:20,065
Maybe that's all.

449
00:34:20,504 --> 00:34:21,732
I fainted because I was scared.

450
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,468
I can't sleep anymore.

451
00:34:25,009 --> 00:34:25,805
I never sleep.

452
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:27,872
I'm afraid to close my eyes

453
00:34:28,279 --> 00:34:33,080
because if I close my eyes
I'm not going to wake up.

454
00:34:34,418 --> 00:34:36,818
So I jerk myself awake.

455
00:34:36,954 --> 00:34:40,446
I yank myself awake
all night long

456
00:34:40,591 --> 00:34:43,492
and then I pour myself a cup
of coffee,

457
00:34:43,594 --> 00:34:47,291
but I'm trying to be brave.

458
00:34:47,398 --> 00:34:48,922
Oh, darling, I know.

459
00:34:49,033 --> 00:34:50,898
I'm scared.

460
00:34:51,001 --> 00:34:54,562
It's all right,
you're going to be okay.

461
00:34:54,672 --> 00:34:57,766
What've you got to be scared of?

462
00:34:57,875 --> 00:35:01,276
There's still Hank and Charlie.
You're forgetting about them.

463
00:35:01,378 --> 00:35:03,539
You're going to be okay.

464
00:35:04,915 --> 00:35:06,109
Where are they?

465
00:35:07,017 --> 00:35:07,847
They're sitting outside.

466
00:35:10,087 --> 00:35:12,055
You're so lucky to have
those boys.

467
00:35:15,226 --> 00:35:15,851
I know I am.

468
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,455
They're good boys both of them.

469
00:35:20,731 --> 00:35:22,289
We re fooling ourselves.

470
00:35:23,033 --> 00:35:24,398
Hank and Charlie won't match.

471
00:35:25,302 --> 00:35:26,496
I won't pretend any more.

472
00:35:27,037 --> 00:35:28,664
We have decisions to make.

473
00:35:28,772 --> 00:35:31,206
We don't have to make them now.

474
00:35:31,308 --> 00:35:32,900
We'll hear about the boys'
tests tomorrow.

475
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,925
I haven't had reason to pretty
myself up

476
00:36:32,036 --> 00:36:34,869
since I can't think when.

477
00:36:36,807 --> 00:36:37,933
Today is the day.

478
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:41,207
They almost got married
once before.

479
00:36:42,179 --> 00:36:44,647
But amber set the church on fire.

480
00:36:48,018 --> 00:36:52,853
Is Coral the same character who
shot Lance's dad in the head?

481
00:36:53,724 --> 00:36:54,748
They're getting married?

482
00:36:55,626 --> 00:36:59,357
Well, he lived.
And she felt awful about it.

483
00:37:14,244 --> 00:37:16,303
What a good job!

484
00:37:18,482 --> 00:37:19,642
You look beautiful!

485
00:37:21,218 --> 00:37:23,118
Don't make fun of me.

486
00:37:23,253 --> 00:37:24,584
I'm not.

487
00:37:24,722 --> 00:37:29,056
I'm just a silly old woman
dressing up for a TV show.

488
00:37:29,393 --> 00:37:30,189
No, you're not.

489
00:37:31,261 --> 00:37:31,989
Where 's your brother?

490
00:37:32,863 --> 00:37:33,795
I don't know.

491
00:37:45,943 --> 00:37:47,035
Aunt Bessie

492
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:04,789
Gone someplace else like you said

493
00:38:04,895 --> 00:38:06,226
Wish I could stay. Love, Hank

494
00:38:10,034 --> 00:38:12,662
What re you doing up?

495
00:38:13,237 --> 00:38:14,397
I'm getting Dad's 1 o'clock.

496
00:38:15,305 --> 00:38:16,272
I was going to do that.

497
00:38:17,274 --> 00:38:17,899
I can do it.

498
00:38:18,842 --> 00:38:20,036
You're suppose to be resting.

499
00:38:20,144 --> 00:38:21,543
I am.

500
00:38:21,645 --> 00:38:24,808
Want some snacks?
I'm making nachos.

501
00:38:25,215 --> 00:38:26,512
Better just cut me some fruit.

502
00:38:33,457 --> 00:38:34,446
Hello?

503
00:38:35,926 --> 00:38:37,689
Yeah, she's here.

504
00:38:38,195 --> 00:38:38,661
Who is it?

505
00:38:38,762 --> 00:38:39,751
Dr. Wally.

506
00:38:46,637 --> 00:38:47,262
You did?

507
00:38:48,472 --> 00:38:49,598
Good!

508
00:38:55,913 --> 00:38:57,039
What is...

509
00:38:59,983 --> 00:39:00,711
I see.

510
00:39:03,353 --> 00:39:05,287
Then I should keep taking what
I'm taking now...

511
00:39:10,127 --> 00:39:11,355
No, no!

512
00:39:13,363 --> 00:39:15,388
I understand. I'm not.

513
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:21,865
Thank you. Goodbye, Doctor.

514
00:39:27,678 --> 00:39:29,407
They got the boys' tests back,

515
00:39:29,513 --> 00:39:31,572
and it looks like it didn't
work out.

516
00:39:35,419 --> 00:39:36,716
It's pretty much what we expected

517
00:39:36,854 --> 00:39:37,616
We knew that the...

518
00:39:42,826 --> 00:39:45,124
May be they made a mistake.

519
00:39:45,229 --> 00:39:45,923
Maybe.

520
00:39:48,499 --> 00:39:51,093
I'll continue my therapies...

521
00:39:51,768 --> 00:39:53,895
That's good, because...

522
00:39:54,671 --> 00:39:55,933
...those are good things to do.

523
00:39:59,776 --> 00:40:00,470
We should tell the boys.

524
00:40:04,815 --> 00:40:05,782
What was l...?

525
00:40:09,553 --> 00:40:10,076
Oh, Dad!

526
00:40:17,194 --> 00:40:18,126
You want to go lie down?

527
00:40:19,329 --> 00:40:20,591
No, no.

528
00:40:21,798 --> 00:40:23,390
I'm fine. I just...

529
00:40:24,968 --> 00:40:26,060
I can do this.

530
00:40:45,756 --> 00:40:46,723
I've been so lucky.

531
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:53,095
I've been so lucky to have Dad
and Ruth.

532
00:40:54,398 --> 00:40:55,797
I've had such love in my life.

533
00:40:57,701 --> 00:41:01,660
...and I've had such...

534
00:41:02,973 --> 00:41:03,940
...such love.

535
00:41:05,309 --> 00:41:06,936
They love you very much.

536
00:41:08,245 --> 00:41:10,304
That's not what I mean. No.

537
00:41:13,016 --> 00:41:14,608
I mean that I love them.

538
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:19,881
I have been so lucky to be able
to love someone so much.

539
00:41:22,526 --> 00:41:24,050
Yeah. You are.

540
00:41:29,099 --> 00:41:29,997
We should tell Hank.

541
00:41:34,638 --> 00:41:35,366
About the tests.

542
00:41:37,507 --> 00:41:38,132
We will.

543
00:41:45,048 --> 00:41:45,639
I better...

544
00:43:01,825 --> 00:43:02,450
Where are you going?

545
00:43:09,466 --> 00:43:10,194
I'm going...

546
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:34,522
Going into the kitchen.

547
00:43:35,792 --> 00:43:37,259
Nobody's had any lunch yet,
have they?

548
00:43:41,932 --> 00:43:42,455
What?

549
00:43:45,869 --> 00:43:46,358
Nothing.

550
00:43:46,937 --> 00:43:50,236
But if you take a drive
or something,

551
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:51,272
you ought to let me know.

552
00:43:59,483 --> 00:44:00,575
I worry about you.

553
00:44:45,996 --> 00:44:46,655
Hi.

554
00:46:00,437 --> 00:46:02,564
Dad's Medication.

555
00:46:31,334 --> 00:46:31,959
Around and around.

556
00:47:37,934 --> 00:47:41,700
See?

557
00:47:44,441 --> 00:47:45,237
It's just us.

558
00:47:47,410 --> 00:47:49,776
Look, Lee's here, too.

559
00:47:52,415 --> 00:47:53,575
You know Lee, don't you?

560
00:48:01,591 --> 00:48:05,391
Bessie, you missed it!

561
00:48:05,929 --> 00:48:07,760
Coral finally married Lance.

562
00:48:08,932 --> 00:48:10,866
Wasn't Lance married to
Coral's mother?

563
00:48:11,868 --> 00:48:14,166
No, Coral was married to
Lance's father.

564
00:48:14,504 --> 00:48:16,631
He's really a nice boy.

565
