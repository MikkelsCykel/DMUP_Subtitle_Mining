00:00:30,663 --> 00:00:34,755
Eighty-six years of banging
our heads against the big green wall...

2
00:00:34,896 --> 00:00:36,759
but we finally did it.

3
00:00:36,896 --> 00:00:40,328
That part you know.
That part everybody knows.

4
00:00:40,463 --> 00:00:43,156
But I got a story
you don't know.

5
00:00:43,296 --> 00:00:46,625
It's about this schoolteacher
friend of mine named Ben.

6
00:00:46,763 --> 00:00:50,855
This is him, back in 1980,
when he was a kid.

7
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,894
The little guy
was going through a tough time.

8
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,689
His parents had just got divorced,
and his mom dragged him up here to Boston...

9
00:00:57,830 --> 00:00:59,693
where he didn't know nobody.

10
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:03,193
One day Ben's mom says,
"Enough mopin 'around, "

11
00:01:03,331 --> 00:01:06,126
and she calls her brother Carl
to take him somewhere...

12
00:01:06,264 --> 00:01:10,094
anywhere, just to get
the kid out of the house.

13
00:01:10,231 --> 00:01:12,628
Uncle Carl didn't have
any children of his own...

14
00:01:12,764 --> 00:01:16,196
so he wasn't exactly
what you’d call "kid sawy. "

15
00:01:16,331 --> 00:01:19,229
I'm not gonna have to change him
or anything, am I?

16
00:01:19,364 --> 00:01:23,194
Carl, look at him.
He's seven, you dope. Come here.

17
00:01:23,332 --> 00:01:26,321
Carl wasn't the kind of uncle
who was gonna take you to the circus...

18
00:01:26,499 --> 00:01:28,862
or the zoo or a puppet show...

19
00:01:28,998 --> 00:01:32,055
but he did know the greatest place
to bring any kid-

20
00:01:32,232 --> 00:01:35,994
The heart and soul of Boston,
Fenway Park.

21
00:01:48,499 --> 00:01:51,192
That was also the day I met Ben.

22
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:56,163
The pretty boy with the glasses?
That's me, Al Waterman. I sell sponges.

23
00:01:56,299 --> 00:01:58,162
Now that's the Green Monster, kid.

24
00:01:58,333 --> 00:01:59,889
- Monster?
- Yep.

25
00:02:00,066 --> 00:02:02,190
I taught the boy
what I knew about the game...

26
00:02:02,366 --> 00:02:04,229
and Carl taught him what he knew.

27
00:02:04,366 --> 00:02:08,321
Hey, Zimmer, you idiot,
what are you batting this bum leadoff for?

28
00:02:09,933 --> 00:02:13,763
Dwight Evans parked
a couple homers, the Sox won...

29
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:18,457
and by day's end, poor Ben had become
one of God’s most pathetic creatures-

30
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,463
- a Red Sox fan.
- Wow!

31
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,827
And that's where the story begins.

32
00:02:23,967 --> 00:02:29,263
Careful, kid.
They'll break your heart.

33
00:02:59,568 --> 00:03:03,193
You could have gone over right there.
Come on, you gotta be aggressive, man.

34
00:03:03,335 --> 00:03:06,130
- Take off the training wheels.
- Hey, I got a crowbar under the seat, okay?

35
00:03:06,301 --> 00:03:08,164
So don't make me
knock your teeth out.

36
00:03:08,301 --> 00:03:10,164
What are you doing?

37
00:03:10,301 --> 00:03:12,630
Audrey and Tammy, are you guys talking
to each other on the phone?

38
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:14,892
We're conferencing Amanda. She's home sick.

39
00:03:15,035 --> 00:03:17,899
Amanda likes that song, Mr. Wrightman.

40
00:03:18,035 --> 00:03:20,296
Can you turn it up, please?

41
00:03:30,536 --> 00:03:33,660
Okay, so I asked for no ham, double turkey,
but it looks like they gave me double ham.

42
00:03:33,803 --> 00:03:36,962
- Do you want me to go back?
- Uh, no. Just toss some of it in my mouth.

43
00:03:37,102 --> 00:03:39,192
- And that teacher's here with those kids.
- What?

44
00:03:39,369 --> 00:03:41,664
That teacher you talked to on the phone,
about coming in, having a tour.

45
00:03:41,803 --> 00:03:43,666
Oh, oh, God, that's today?

46
00:03:43,803 --> 00:03:46,200
- They're here.
- Oh, no.

47
00:03:46,337 --> 00:03:50,928
Okay, uh, just pretend that you’re me
and take them around and- Hi.

48
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:54,059
- There they are.
- Ben Wrightman. We talked on the phone.

49
00:03:54,203 --> 00:03:57,828
- Nice to meet you.
- Yes, yes, I've been waiting for you.

50
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,833
Hi, I'm Lindsey Meeks.

51
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:02,231
Excuse me.

52
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:04,233
Can I get anyone
something to drink?

53
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:07,029
Vodka martini, straight up.
Three olives, please.

54
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:09,033
Hey, I asked you to behave.

55
00:04:09,171 --> 00:04:11,194
Uh, are you allowed to hit them?

56
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:13,995
Yeah, actually.
Do you wanna take a swipe at him?

57
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:16,034
I'll hold him if you want.

58
00:04:16,171 --> 00:04:19,967
- Maybe later.
- Uh, okay. As I said on the phone, Lindsey...

59
00:04:20,104 --> 00:04:22,296
I teach honors geometry,
ninth grade.

60
00:04:22,438 --> 00:04:25,302
And every year I pick
a few promising math students...

61
00:04:25,438 --> 00:04:27,903
to meet someone who's pursued
mathematics as an educational discipline...

62
00:04:28,037 --> 00:04:31,161
and has made practical use
of that education.

63
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:33,462
So, thanks for having us.

64
00:04:35,204 --> 00:04:37,067
All right, the client
I'm working for right now...

65
00:04:37,204 --> 00:04:39,431
is this really cool company
called Marquis Jet...

66
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:43,094
and they’re trying to figure out how to
make renting private jets more affordable.

67
00:04:43,239 --> 00:04:46,228
Wow. Now that's the way to go.

68
00:04:46,405 --> 00:04:48,337
Yeah, and they're growing
like crazy...

69
00:04:48,472 --> 00:04:50,562
so they'd have to buy more jets
in order to meet the demands.

70
00:04:50,738 --> 00:04:52,828
Now let me ask you guys
a crazy question.

71
00:04:52,972 --> 00:04:55,233
Are any of you in the habit
of looking at numbers-

72
00:04:55,372 --> 00:04:58,929
You know, addresses, license plates,
phone numbers- and adding them up...

73
00:04:59,072 --> 00:05:02,595
and rearranging them in your head
to make more interesting patterns?

74
00:05:02,739 --> 00:05:07,103
Oh, my God,
she knows my secret shame.

75
00:05:07,239 --> 00:05:11,762
Well, step into the light, my friend,
because this is the church of numbers...

76
00:05:11,906 --> 00:05:13,838
and every day is Sunday.

77
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:19,106
- She was a major hottie.
- Major?

78
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,172
- Colonel hottie.
- Yeah, she went optic for you, Mr. Wrightman.

79
00:05:22,306 --> 00:05:25,272
- Optic?
- Yeah, I saw her glance to the pants.

80
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,803
- No way. - Yeah.
- What do you mean?

81
00:05:27,939 --> 00:05:31,427
- I mean she was totally-
- No, no, not you. You. What did you mean?

82
00:05:31,573 --> 00:05:34,596
Nothin', you know.

83
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,331
Well, come on, man.
You saw her.

84
00:05:37,473 --> 00:05:41,768
What? Wait. Are you saying
that she's out of my league?

85
00:05:41,907 --> 00:05:45,703
She is bringing some serious heat, man.
I don't know if you got the bat speed.

86
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,602
Oh, I got the bat speed. I got plenty
of bat speed. I could hit her best cheese.

87
00:05:51,007 --> 00:05:54,598
Ezra, I need those
customer satisfaction data reports.

88
00:05:54,774 --> 00:05:57,706
- I put them on your desk, Lindsey.
- Good lad. Keep me posted.

89
00:05:57,875 --> 00:06:00,534
You got it.

90
00:06:00,674 --> 00:06:02,901
- Those kids were cute.
- Which kids?

91
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:06,098
- The ones from earlier today.
- Oh. Yeah.

92
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:09,604
Maybe I should become a teacher
or a college professor, you know.

93
00:06:09,741 --> 00:06:13,434
The hours would be better. You get summers free.
It's so much less competitive.

94
00:06:13,574 --> 00:06:16,563
- Oh, my God, Jack is leaving.
- What?

95
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:18,571
Jack is leaving
the company next summer.

96
00:06:21,308 --> 00:06:24,740
What that- So, do you think they're gonna
bring someone in from the outside?

97
00:06:24,908 --> 00:06:28,533
- I have- I don't know. - Or do you
think they're gonna promote from within?

98
00:06:28,709 --> 00:06:30,572
I thought you were
becoming a teacher.

99
00:06:30,709 --> 00:06:34,607
Low blood sugar. I didn't eat yet.

100
00:06:34,742 --> 00:06:36,332
Hi.

101
00:06:36,475 --> 00:06:38,565
Hi. I didn't wanna interrupt.

102
00:06:38,709 --> 00:06:42,141
It sounded like you were involved
with some major corporate hoo-ha.

103
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:44,764
Oh, well, there's a position
about to open up...

104
00:06:44,909 --> 00:06:47,568
so it might get
mildly murderous around here.

105
00:06:47,709 --> 00:06:50,231
Oh. Wha-Wha-Wha-
I want your job! I'm the boss!

106
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:52,239
Wha-Wha-

107
00:06:52,376 --> 00:06:57,172
Yes. So, um-

108
00:06:57,309 --> 00:07:01,071
Why am I here? Um-

109
00:07:01,243 --> 00:07:04,936
I just wanted you to know that you really
got through to the kids today.

110
00:07:05,077 --> 00:07:06,940
You know,
they're really juiced.

111
00:07:07,077 --> 00:07:10,134
Oh, thanks. They were- They were great.

112
00:07:10,277 --> 00:07:13,300
Well, you're welcome.
Thank you.

113
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:21,037
So, is the conversation over?

114
00:07:21,177 --> 00:07:23,040
You mean 'cause neither of us
are speaking?

115
00:07:23,177 --> 00:07:25,267
Yeah.

116
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:28,308
No. Yeah, I also-
I came back because I just-

117
00:07:28,444 --> 00:07:32,376
I wanted to ask you if I could
ask you out sometime.

118
00:07:32,544 --> 00:07:34,975
Socially.

119
00:07:35,111 --> 00:07:37,975
I won't be bringing the kids.

120
00:07:38,111 --> 00:07:39,974
Oh!

121
00:07:41,777 --> 00:07:43,969
Uh-

122
00:07:44,111 --> 00:07:45,974
- Hike.
- Get him! Get him!

123
00:07:49,578 --> 00:07:52,601
- Oh!
- All right, good "D." Good "D."

124
00:07:55,745 --> 00:07:58,677
I know why she wouldn't go out with me.
She thinks I'm not in her class.

125
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:02,505
- She said that?
- No. I could see it on her face.

126
00:08:02,645 --> 00:08:05,167
- "Like I would really date a schoolteacher. "
- Ouch.

127
00:08:05,345 --> 00:08:08,334
Down, set, hike.

128
00:08:13,412 --> 00:08:15,775
Yeah, go, go, go!

129
00:08:18,412 --> 00:08:22,105
Ben, what are you doing? It's two-hand touch.
You were down back there.

130
00:08:22,246 --> 00:08:24,235
And back there and back there.

131
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:27,072
What's the matter with you?

132
00:08:27,212 --> 00:08:29,144
Come on, guys.

133
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:32,302
Sorry. Sorry, guys.

134
00:08:36,013 --> 00:08:38,342
All right, Lindsey,
so what's the matter with this one?

135
00:08:38,513 --> 00:08:41,104
He's not smart?
He's not attractive?

136
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,246
He was.
It's just, you know-

137
00:08:44,413 --> 00:08:49,209
- I don't know. It's hopeless.
- Oh, boy, here we go.

138
00:08:49,347 --> 00:08:52,870
You're right, I'm an idiot.
I'm about to turn 20-10...

139
00:08:53,013 --> 00:08:56,070
and the dating market is,
shall we say, bearish.

140
00:08:56,213 --> 00:09:00,736
And instead of becoming more open
and available, I'm becoming less open.

141
00:09:00,881 --> 00:09:03,711
Come on, people.
Talking isn't burning calories.

142
00:09:03,847 --> 00:09:06,176
Let's go. Start pedaling.
Come on.

143
00:09:15,681 --> 00:09:18,203
Maybe you should date
a different kind of guy.

144
00:09:18,381 --> 00:09:20,244
Why? What do you mean?

145
00:09:20,381 --> 00:09:25,245
Well, all the guys you date are sharp
and competitive and successful.

146
00:09:25,381 --> 00:09:27,778
- It's like you’re dating yourself.
- Ding, ding, ding.

147
00:09:28,982 --> 00:09:31,539
Wh-What's wrong
with the schoolteacher?

148
00:09:31,681 --> 00:09:35,010
- Well-
- He's a schoolteacher.

149
00:09:35,149 --> 00:09:38,706
Which means he has
a small... income.

150
00:09:38,848 --> 00:09:43,280
All right, people, let's shut your piehole
and speed it back up. Come on!

151
00:09:43,415 --> 00:09:48,541
- Come on!
- Die, you Nazi spin-bitch.

152
00:09:53,883 --> 00:09:58,212
Hey! Go, run a post. Go!

153
00:09:59,716 --> 00:10:01,272
Oh!

154
00:10:01,415 --> 00:10:03,404
Who did that?

155
00:10:03,549 --> 00:10:06,606
That's it.
You're coming with me, mister.

156
00:10:06,749 --> 00:10:08,976
What do you think,
this is your own private playground?

157
00:10:09,116 --> 00:10:10,979
Get in here.

158
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:18,073
Thanks, man.
I owe you one.

159
00:10:20,283 --> 00:10:22,146
Go ahead.

160
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:29,545
Hey, Ben, are you going
to watch the Celtics later?

161
00:10:29,683 --> 00:10:31,740
Uh, I don't know.

162
00:10:31,884 --> 00:10:35,008
You know, there are other sports
besides baseball.

163
00:10:35,151 --> 00:10:38,844
I would debate you, Ed, but that would only
lead to me being dragged away in handcuffs.

164
00:10:38,984 --> 00:10:42,575
Hey, speaking of baseball, Ben, wanna help me
coach the J. V. team this year?

165
00:10:42,718 --> 00:10:46,480
Why? You're doing a great job.
I mean, you can’t just go by wins and losses.

166
00:10:46,618 --> 00:10:48,516
Aw, come on, Ben.
The kids listen to you.

167
00:10:48,651 --> 00:10:51,242
I think it's going good
the way it is, you know?

168
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:53,280
You coach the team,
and I help out whenever I can.

169
00:10:53,417 --> 00:10:56,871
Then, if I don't make it or-

170
00:10:57,051 --> 00:10:59,812
Hey, Rita, when did I get this message
from Lindsey Meeks?

171
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:04,474
A tip might be where it says
"Time Called: 2:30."

172
00:11:06,985 --> 00:11:10,042
Come on, pull!

173
00:11:10,185 --> 00:11:12,844
So, do you think it'll be a problem
that you’re more successful than him?

174
00:11:12,985 --> 00:11:16,678
- Who says I am?
- Well, I mean, at least financially.

175
00:11:16,819 --> 00:11:20,251
It's not like he's playing a flute
with a hatful of dollar bills in front of him.

176
00:11:20,385 --> 00:11:23,578
- He's a teacher.
- Teaching's a cool thing.

177
00:11:23,719 --> 00:11:26,843
Yeah. Besides, why does everything
in my life have to be a trophy?

178
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:29,951
- I mean, who am I trying to impress?
- Hey, we're on your side.

179
00:11:30,119 --> 00:11:32,914
No, I know.
It's just that I hate when people-

180
00:11:33,052 --> 00:11:35,779
- Ow!
- Oopsie.

181
00:11:50,987 --> 00:11:55,510
Oh, just kill me.
Just take a hammer and kill me.

182
00:12:02,187 --> 00:12:06,812
Oh, shit. Who is it?

183
00:12:06,953 --> 00:12:09,384
I -It's me. It's Ben.
Your date?

184
00:12:09,554 --> 00:12:12,281
Oh, God, no.

185
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,409
Oh.

186
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:21,052
I'm sick. Come back.
I'll call you tomorrow. Go away.

187
00:12:21,187 --> 00:12:23,448
Wait, wait, wait. What kind of sick?
You okay? You in pain?

188
00:12:23,587 --> 00:12:28,110
I-
ate at this new place.

189
00:12:28,255 --> 00:12:30,312
I think-

190
00:12:36,988 --> 00:12:39,317
Are you faking it? 'Cause we don't
have to really do this if you don't-

191
00:12:48,055 --> 00:12:49,918
Mommy.

192
00:12:53,321 --> 00:12:55,411
Ernie, go away.

193
00:12:55,555 --> 00:12:57,952
Ernie, don't eat that!

194
00:12:58,089 --> 00:13:00,680
Oh, shit.

195
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:04,379
Uh-

196
00:13:04,523 --> 00:13:06,546
So, you wanna pull the plug
on this thing or-

197
00:13:14,089 --> 00:13:17,521
All right, here we go.
Come on.

198
00:13:17,656 --> 00:13:19,780
All right, we're almost there.

199
00:13:19,923 --> 00:13:22,684
Okay. Okay.

200
00:13:22,823 --> 00:13:25,414
Now sit right here.
Oh, God!

201
00:13:25,556 --> 00:13:28,317
All right. Okay.
Here. Pick your head up.

202
00:13:28,457 --> 00:13:30,752
Up. Okay, up.

203
00:13:32,423 --> 00:13:35,287
Uh, all right. Um-

204
00:13:35,423 --> 00:13:38,253
Do you have any, like,
pajamas or a nightgown?

205
00:13:38,423 --> 00:13:40,854
In the top drawer.

206
00:13:41,023 --> 00:13:43,614
Top drawer. Okay.

207
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:46,312
All right, here we go.

208
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:49,819
Well, Wonder Woman’s been looking for these.

209
00:13:49,957 --> 00:13:51,820
I gotta call her.
Let her know they're here.

210
00:13:54,624 --> 00:13:59,079
- Okay. All right. I'll help you up.
- Mm-mm.

211
00:13:59,224 --> 00:14:01,951
- Get up.
- I'm sorry about this.

212
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:05,352
- Don't worry. Come on. Come on.
- I'm so sorry.

213
00:14:05,491 --> 00:14:07,956
I'm gonna help you change, all right?
I won't look. I promise.

214
00:14:08,091 --> 00:14:10,181
- Uh-huh.
- Okay.

215
00:14:15,224 --> 00:14:18,156
Okay, I looked.

216
00:14:20,558 --> 00:14:22,547
Let's get this on.

217
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:27,048
Get your arms through.

218
00:14:34,259 --> 00:14:38,418
Okay, here we go. You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

219
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:40,683
There's nothing left
to throw up, I promise.

220
00:14:40,826 --> 00:14:45,690
And if you do, here's Mr. Hamper.
Okay? All right.

221
00:14:58,527 --> 00:15:01,118
Here. Drink this
when you feel like you can, okay?

222
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,555
- Thank you. Thank you, Bill.
- All right.

223
00:15:03,693 --> 00:15:06,090
It's Ben.
Okay, go back to sleep.

224
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:05,817
- Hey.
- Hi.

225
00:16:05,961 --> 00:16:07,654
How you feeling?

226
00:16:07,795 --> 00:16:13,523
Uh, I mean, I'm not about to enter
any pie-eating contests.

227
00:16:15,428 --> 00:16:18,757
Did you clean up my bathroom,
or did I dream that?

228
00:16:18,896 --> 00:16:24,624
Me? No. Uh, the vomit elves came in.
And, uh, really adorable.

229
00:16:24,762 --> 00:16:28,819
Really cute little things.
I mean, little caps and little barf bags.

230
00:16:30,763 --> 00:16:33,456
Well, thank you.

231
00:16:33,596 --> 00:16:36,027
I mean, you really,
really went above and beyond.

232
00:16:36,196 --> 00:16:39,787
Uh, no, please. It wasn't a big deal.
You were very ladylike.

233
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:41,793
Hardly any "chunk age. "

234
00:16:47,264 --> 00:16:50,059
- What's in the bag?
- I got some, uh-

235
00:16:50,197 --> 00:16:52,685
I got some movies just in case you woke up.
Not in case you woke up.

236
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:55,954
I knew you were going to wake up.
In case you woke up in the middle of the night.

237
00:16:57,631 --> 00:16:59,994
Yeah? Anything good?

238
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:02,287
Uh, mostly animated
pornography from Japan.

239
00:17:02,464 --> 00:17:05,691
And a little something
I like to watch too when I feel sick.

240
00:17:05,831 --> 00:17:08,058
Well, for me, it's Annie Hall.

241
00:17:08,197 --> 00:17:11,594
- Wh-What did you say?
- Annie Hall.

242
00:17:11,731 --> 00:17:15,094
Whoa, this is like-
This is unbelievable.

243
00:17:15,231 --> 00:17:17,094
Road House.

244
00:17:20,631 --> 00:17:23,688
Are you feeling- Is this crazy?
I mean, what are the odds?

245
00:17:23,831 --> 00:17:25,729
Spooky.

246
00:17:29,231 --> 00:17:32,254
No, she cannot
have my assistant.

247
00:17:32,431 --> 00:17:34,828
Because I trained Carrie.
I like her.

248
00:17:34,965 --> 00:17:39,057
Listen. Do we have to settle this right now?
I'm with a... person.

249
00:17:40,665 --> 00:17:44,153
Yes. Thank you.
Okay, I'll speak to you tomorrow. Bye-bye.

250
00:17:44,299 --> 00:17:46,890
I'm really, really sorry.

251
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:50,725
Actually, I'm sorry. I ate everything cool.
I just left you a pile of sauce.

252
00:17:50,865 --> 00:17:54,592
That's okay. Actually, I'm the worst.
I eat off everybody's plate.

253
00:17:54,732 --> 00:17:57,925
In fact, my friends, they call me "the seagull. "

254
00:17:58,065 --> 00:18:00,360
Oh, hi, seagull.

255
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:04,291
Nice.

256
00:18:04,432 --> 00:18:08,194
No, really, I appreciate you being cool
about the phone thing...

257
00:18:08,366 --> 00:18:11,559
because I once went on a date with this guy
who got so angry I was on the phone...

258
00:18:11,699 --> 00:18:14,324
that he grabbed it out of my hand,
and he threw it in the fish tank.

259
00:18:14,466 --> 00:18:16,931
I would never do that.

260
00:18:17,066 --> 00:18:20,157
What are your pet peeves?
What stresses you out?

261
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,822
- Mm, I got-
- And I'm only asking...

262
00:18:22,966 --> 00:18:26,227
because frankly
the men I meet are highly-

263
00:18:26,367 --> 00:18:28,265
I date poodles basically.

264
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,298
And I'm really relaxed,
you know? Totally.

265
00:18:31,433 --> 00:18:34,058
- Son of a- Stop ringing.
- I got it.

266
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,063
Let me do it.
Let me do it.

267
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:40,461
Hello? Uh, no, she isn't.
May I take a message?

268
00:18:40,634 --> 00:18:43,997
This is Ben.
I'm her houseboy/sex slave.

269
00:18:44,134 --> 00:18:47,896
Okay. You betcha.
Bye-bye.

270
00:18:48,034 --> 00:18:50,124
Call your mother.

271
00:18:52,668 --> 00:18:55,190
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
So you don't have a cell phone...

272
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:58,129
- a BlackBerry, a pager, nothing?
- No.

273
00:18:58,268 --> 00:19:00,597
Well, what if
some sudden crisis occurs...

274
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:02,825
like your father has a heart attack
or something?

275
00:19:02,968 --> 00:19:05,832
- My father died two years ago.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

276
00:19:05,968 --> 00:19:08,559
I just found out this morning,
so it's been a rough 24 hours.

277
00:19:08,701 --> 00:19:10,758
You know, maybe I should get a cell phone.
That's a good idea.

278
00:19:10,902 --> 00:19:13,800
- You're funny, Ben-
- Wrightman.

279
00:19:13,935 --> 00:19:15,798
- Wrightman. Yeah.
- Yeah.

280
00:19:15,935 --> 00:19:17,798
- You forgot my last name.
- No, I just blanked.

281
00:19:17,935 --> 00:19:21,196
I know why you forgot. That's all right.
I bet when you talk to your friends...

282
00:19:21,335 --> 00:19:23,960
you call me Ben the schoolteacher,
am I right?

283
00:19:25,902 --> 00:19:27,765
- Well?
- That's okay.

284
00:19:27,902 --> 00:19:30,868
What do you call me
to your friends?

285
00:19:31,002 --> 00:19:36,162
I call you Lindsey...

286
00:19:36,302 --> 00:19:38,893
the vomit girl,
the puker, Pukey.

287
00:19:39,036 --> 00:19:41,263
Everyone says, "You going out with Pukey
tonight?" I'm like, "Yeah. Why?"

288
00:19:41,402 --> 00:19:44,731
"You wanna play video games or something?"
I'm like, "No, I'm going out with Pukey. "

289
00:19:44,869 --> 00:19:47,334
That's horrible.

290
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:52,459
Hey, anything I've said about you would be
an understatement, really.

291
00:20:05,937 --> 00:20:08,903
- Hey, Lindsey!
- Hi!

292
00:20:09,037 --> 00:20:12,400
- Hi.
- Hi, I'm Ben the schoolteacher.

293
00:20:12,537 --> 00:20:14,400
Ian. Sarah.

294
00:20:14,537 --> 00:20:16,400
- Steve. Molly.
- Oh, thanks for having me.

295
00:20:16,538 --> 00:20:19,197
- Robin and Chris.
- Welcome aboard.

296
00:20:19,371 --> 00:20:22,030
Well, let's start
the interrogation.

297
00:20:22,204 --> 00:20:24,067
No, no, it's not like that.

298
00:20:24,204 --> 00:20:26,692
Here. It's for the urine sample.

299
00:20:26,871 --> 00:20:30,530
Shoot, I wish you would have told me.
I just took a whiz in your bushes.

300
00:20:30,671 --> 00:20:32,728
Do you want to-

301
00:20:32,871 --> 00:20:34,734
Show him the house.

302
00:20:42,604 --> 00:20:46,831
- Lindsey, this Ben guy has got such a good vibe.
- Good.

303
00:20:46,971 --> 00:20:49,459
- And he's nothing like the guys you usually date.
- I know.

304
00:20:49,605 --> 00:20:53,128
- And how cute is he?
- Yeah? Well, I'm really glad you guys feel this way...

305
00:20:53,305 --> 00:20:56,634
because if you didn't, I was gonna
have to find three new friends.

306
00:20:56,772 --> 00:20:59,704
- No, no, no, I really think you've got something here.
- Me too.

307
00:20:59,872 --> 00:21:03,770
Yeah, but... something's
not quite right.

308
00:21:03,906 --> 00:21:06,269
- Robin.
- No, no, he's great.

309
00:21:06,405 --> 00:21:08,768
He is. I love him.
He's a doll.

310
00:21:08,906 --> 00:21:11,428
- But he's not 22.
- So?

311
00:21:11,572 --> 00:21:15,731
So, where's he been?
Why is he still on the market?

312
00:21:15,872 --> 00:21:19,099
- Um-
- Maybe he hasn't found the right person yet.

313
00:21:19,239 --> 00:21:21,602
Well, by now he should be
with the wrong person.

314
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:24,638
How has he not been
tranquilized and tagged?

315
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:27,906
Let me get this straight.

316
00:21:28,072 --> 00:21:30,503
You got two season tickets
behind the Red Sox dugout?

317
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,367
- Mm-hmm. Yeah. My uncle left them to me.
- Behind the dugout?

318
00:21:33,506 --> 00:21:36,028
Yeah. Well, not really behind, like next to it.
Fifteen feet away.

319
00:21:36,174 --> 00:21:39,163
You can see right into it at a certain point.
It's pretty awesome.

320
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,867
Let me ask you this.

321
00:21:46,007 --> 00:21:48,199
Do you find my wife
attractive at all?

322
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,203
'Cause we could work
something out.

323
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:56,703
Well, do you?

324
00:21:56,841 --> 00:22:00,273
You know what you need to do? You need to
go to his apartment and go through his things.

325
00:22:00,407 --> 00:22:03,134
You need to go through his closets,
sofa cushions. You need to get on his computer.

326
00:22:03,307 --> 00:22:05,829
And what exactly
am I looking for?

327
00:22:06,008 --> 00:22:08,473
Anything that explains
why he’s still single.

328
00:22:08,641 --> 00:22:10,833
My company can run
a credit check on him.

329
00:22:10,974 --> 00:22:13,132
You know, he could be
a deadbeat dad.

330
00:22:13,275 --> 00:22:16,139
This is an insane asylum.

331
00:22:16,275 --> 00:22:21,401
So, uh, when they wheeled out
Ted Williams at the all-star game-

332
00:22:21,542 --> 00:22:25,701
I was there.
I was 10 feet away from him.

333
00:22:25,842 --> 00:22:31,206
Old men crying.
Tears.

334
00:22:31,341 --> 00:22:33,670
Tough old guys.

335
00:22:33,842 --> 00:22:36,865
I even started
to lose it, you know.

336
00:22:37,042 --> 00:22:39,405
I got a program.
I could show you.

337
00:22:40,742 --> 00:22:44,265
If Lindsey ever breaks up
with you, I'll kill her.

338
00:22:44,409 --> 00:22:46,567
Lindsey, do you remember
that guy Maureen Durst went out with?

339
00:22:46,709 --> 00:22:50,766
- Uh, sort of. Why?
- Terry what’s-his-name?

340
00:22:50,909 --> 00:22:53,670
We all thought
he was great too.

341
00:22:53,809 --> 00:22:56,274
- Well, what happened?
- Oh, my God. She went to his apartment and-

342
00:22:56,409 --> 00:22:58,533
Shh. My story. Stand by.

343
00:22:58,676 --> 00:23:01,164
She's at his place.
He's in the shower.

344
00:23:01,309 --> 00:23:05,105
She wants to make the bed, so she goes
to the closet. Guess what she finds.

345
00:23:05,243 --> 00:23:07,232
Oh, I don't know.
What'd she find?

346
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:11,569
Two large plastic bags containing
all of the hair and nail clippings...

347
00:23:11,709 --> 00:23:13,698
from his entire life.

348
00:23:13,876 --> 00:23:15,739
Eww!

349
00:23:15,876 --> 00:23:18,103
- Eww!
- That's a true story.

350
00:23:18,243 --> 00:23:21,038
I'm telling you, there is a reason
this Ben guy is still single.

351
00:25:18,748 --> 00:25:20,975
- Come on!
- I promised him we'd wait.

352
00:25:21,147 --> 00:25:24,670
- We're always waiting for him.
- I gave him my word.

353
00:25:24,848 --> 00:25:27,040
You guys wait?

354
00:25:27,182 --> 00:25:29,045
- Yeah.
- Come on, man.

355
00:25:29,182 --> 00:25:31,045
- Did anyone die because you’re here?
- No, no, no.

356
00:25:31,182 --> 00:25:33,374
I got another anesthesiologist
to cover for me.

357
00:25:33,514 --> 00:25:35,377
All right, are you ready?

358
00:25:35,515 --> 00:25:39,106
Hey, come on! God.

359
00:25:53,916 --> 00:25:55,779
A new season.

360
00:25:55,916 --> 00:25:59,939
A clean slate.

361
00:26:00,116 --> 00:26:01,979
Yep, this smells like the year.

362
00:26:09,916 --> 00:26:12,245
- Hey, you wanna know something?
- What?

363
00:26:12,383 --> 00:26:16,475
- I like you.
- I like you.

364
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:21,048
No, I mean, I really like you. I even wrote down
a list of all the things I like about you.

365
00:26:21,183 --> 00:26:23,307
You made a list?

366
00:26:23,449 --> 00:26:26,937
Yeah. I don't have it with me,
but I can remember it.

367
00:26:27,117 --> 00:26:30,514
I'll skip down because
the first six are all body parts.

368
00:26:30,683 --> 00:26:35,115
Uh, number seven:
I like that you drink in the afternoon.

369
00:26:35,284 --> 00:26:39,909
Number eight: I like sometimes you talk
out of the side of your mouth a little bit.

370
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:42,607
And it's like- it's like an adorable
stroke victim.

371
00:26:42,751 --> 00:26:45,114
I do?

372
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:48,647
No, it's very cute.
It really is. Uh, number nine.

373
00:26:48,784 --> 00:26:51,511
You know, when you're getting ready
in the mirror, just when you're about finished...

374
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:53,514
you go like-

375
00:26:53,651 --> 00:26:57,481
It's so cute, I wanna kill myself.
It's fantastic. Uh-

376
00:26:57,617 --> 00:27:00,276
- Hey, when's your break?
- Hmm?

377
00:27:00,451 --> 00:27:03,644
- For your school vacation. When do you get off?
- End of March.

378
00:27:03,817 --> 00:27:06,180
- That's when you're in Baltimore, right?
- Yeah.

379
00:27:06,318 --> 00:27:11,341
Well, it's a really big deal in my family,
because it's my dad's birthday and Easter...

380
00:27:11,485 --> 00:27:14,110
and my sister's anniversary
all in the same week.

381
00:27:14,251 --> 00:27:16,614
- A cluster.
- Yeah. Uh-

382
00:27:16,752 --> 00:27:20,309
So, uh, how would
you like to come?

383
00:27:22,818 --> 00:27:25,181
Ooh, too fast?
Too serious?

384
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:27,511
No, why?
Did I look like I was just-

385
00:27:27,652 --> 00:27:29,810
- You were a little.
- No, 'cause-

386
00:27:29,952 --> 00:27:32,440
No, I-I made-
I have a previous commitment.

387
00:27:32,618 --> 00:27:36,050
- Oh, plans?
- Yeah, yeah.

388
00:27:36,219 --> 00:27:38,684
Um, see, I didn't tell you about it,
'cause I knew you were gonna be away.

389
00:27:38,852 --> 00:27:43,443
I figured it wouldn't matter,
but every year during Easter vacation...

390
00:27:43,586 --> 00:27:48,382
uh, me and my friends,
we go down to Florida.

391
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:53,974
You and your buddies go down
to Florida for spring break? At your age?

392
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,915
No, no, no, not spring break.
Spring training with the Red Sox.

393
00:27:57,053 --> 00:27:59,314
Oh, you get to train
with the Red Sox?

394
00:27:59,453 --> 00:28:01,419
Are you allowed to do that?

395
00:28:01,554 --> 00:28:04,645
Well, we don't actually-
We watch the games.

396
00:28:04,786 --> 00:28:06,649
Aren't those just practice games?

397
00:28:06,819 --> 00:28:09,148
Yeah, yeah, but there's
more to it than that.

398
00:28:09,287 --> 00:28:12,684
We scout the players.
We-We say which players they should keep...

399
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:15,718
- which they should get rid of.
- And the Red Sox ask your opinion?

400
00:28:16,854 --> 00:28:18,717
Well, not yet.

401
00:28:18,854 --> 00:28:22,047
But if they ever do, uh-

402
00:28:22,188 --> 00:28:25,086
Okay, I've been avoiding this.

403
00:28:27,754 --> 00:28:30,584
There's something
you don't know about me.

404
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,015
Oh, God, here comes
the bag of hair.

405
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:41,282
The thing is, uh,
I am a Red Sox fan.

406
00:28:41,454 --> 00:28:46,512
- Yeah?
- No, I'm like a big, big Red Sox fan.

407
00:28:46,688 --> 00:28:49,552
I know. I mean, I've been
to your apartment...

408
00:28:49,688 --> 00:28:55,120
and seen the Red Sox dish towels
and glasses and the Yankee toilet paper.

409
00:28:55,255 --> 00:28:58,550
- It's like you live in a gift shop.
- It's worse.

410
00:29:01,455 --> 00:29:03,444
See, when I was a kid,
I moved here from New Jersey...

411
00:29:03,589 --> 00:29:05,555
and I didn't have
any friends or anything...

412
00:29:05,689 --> 00:29:07,779
so my Uncle Carl started
taking me to Fenway Park.

413
00:29:10,055 --> 00:29:12,953
I just-
I got lost in the game.

414
00:29:13,122 --> 00:29:15,417
I mean, the ballpark
and the people.

415
00:29:15,589 --> 00:29:17,816
The color, the sounds.

416
00:29:17,956 --> 00:29:19,854
The smells.

417
00:29:22,056 --> 00:29:24,079
And then he got cancer
and he died.

418
00:29:24,223 --> 00:29:26,984
He left me his season tickets.

419
00:29:27,123 --> 00:29:28,986
And it's a passion.

420
00:29:29,123 --> 00:29:33,987
I mean, it's a very,
very big part of my life.

421
00:29:34,123 --> 00:29:38,146
And it's been a problem
with me and women.

422
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:40,687
Oh, ah, I know those women.

423
00:29:40,823 --> 00:29:44,619
The "pay attention to me"
and "why aren’t you talking to me?"

424
00:29:44,757 --> 00:29:48,950
- Yeah. Exactly.
- God, those women are so pathetic.

425
00:29:49,124 --> 00:29:51,988
Yeah, it's like,
"What are you getting so worked up for?

426
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:54,612
- I mean, you're not even doing it, you're watching it. "
- Yeah.

427
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:58,278
It's like, "Hey, how about sometimes
I like to be 11 years old. "

428
00:29:58,424 --> 00:30:02,083
- Yeah. - I like being part of something
that's bigger than me-than I.

429
00:30:02,224 --> 00:30:05,213
It's good for your soul to invest
in something that you can't control.

430
00:30:05,357 --> 00:30:08,050
You're a romantic.

431
00:30:08,191 --> 00:30:10,349
Hmm?

432
00:30:10,491 --> 00:30:15,219
You have a lyrical soul. You can love
under the best and worst conditions.

433
00:30:15,357 --> 00:30:18,948
I don't know.
Well, yeah, yeah.

434
00:30:19,125 --> 00:30:22,613
Yeah, I guess so.
Hey, uh-

435
00:30:25,358 --> 00:30:27,983
You took a really big chance
inviting me to meet your family.

436
00:30:28,125 --> 00:30:31,887
Now I'm gonna take a chance. A big one.

437
00:30:41,458 --> 00:30:45,890
Lindsey, will you
go to opening day with me?

438
00:30:48,392 --> 00:30:51,222
Yes.

439
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:53,222
Yes. Yes!

440
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:55,756
You hear that?
She said yes!

441
00:30:55,892 --> 00:30:57,858
Mary, look. Merry Christmas.

442
00:30:58,026 --> 00:31:00,389
Clarence, look how
everyone showed up. It's amaz-

443
00:31:00,526 --> 00:31:03,458
We're going to opening day.
It's official. We're going.

444
00:31:03,593 --> 00:31:03,683
- Whoo-hoo!
- Whoo!

445
00:31:06,726 --> 00:31:09,850
What did Dad do to his hair?

446
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:12,720
- I can't even look at him.
- I know.

447
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:14,950
How could you let him?

448
00:31:15,093 --> 00:31:18,991
He's 60. It's a big
psychological milestone.

449
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:22,218
He's struggling with it.
He thinks he looks good.

450
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:28,784
Now don't start with me.
Listen, I forgot to tell you that Donna-

451
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,323
Stop it! Out!

452
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:35,789
Outside! Out.

453
00:31:35,928 --> 00:31:37,791
I don't know
what's with him lately.

454
00:31:37,928 --> 00:31:40,917
Oh, I'm sorry.
I forgot to tell you. Donna called.

455
00:31:41,061 --> 00:31:42,924
- And they're on their way.
- Okay.

456
00:31:43,061 --> 00:31:44,993
Good.

457
00:31:48,128 --> 00:31:52,220
He is scaring the dog.
How can you stand it?

458
00:31:52,361 --> 00:31:55,122
He fanned me with a magazine for four years
when I was going through menopause.

459
00:31:55,261 --> 00:31:58,091
I can put up with this.

460
00:31:58,228 --> 00:32:02,217
Go back in and talk to him.
He misses you.

461
00:32:02,395 --> 00:32:05,986
Okay. One more.

462
00:32:09,095 --> 00:32:13,027
Yeah, but do you see
him ever playing in a Yankee uniform?

463
00:32:13,162 --> 00:32:14,388
- Hi.
- Hey, kiddo.

464
00:32:14,528 --> 00:32:16,391
- Want a cookie?
- No, thanks.

465
00:32:18,528 --> 00:32:22,187
- Your mama says you've been busy.
- Ooh.

466
00:32:22,329 --> 00:32:25,954
No Red Sox fan has forgotten
last October and Aaron Boone.

467
00:32:26,095 --> 00:32:28,686
- Hey, is this about the Red Sox?
- Yeah.

468
00:32:28,828 --> 00:32:31,760
That next year is the year.

469
00:32:31,896 --> 00:32:34,361
Steve Levy is in Fort Myers
with some of the members of the set...

470
00:32:34,529 --> 00:32:37,461
known as Red Sox Nation.

471
00:32:37,596 --> 00:32:40,789
Down here in Fort Myers, Florida,
the story is always the same.

472
00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:44,453
- When the calendar page flips to March-
- Are you interested?

473
00:32:44,596 --> 00:32:46,686
No, I just, you know-

474
00:32:46,829 --> 00:32:50,921
I mean, I have a friend
who is interested.

475
00:32:51,063 --> 00:32:53,392
Oh, the schoolteacher.

476
00:32:54,796 --> 00:32:57,227
When are we gonna meet
this future breakup?

477
00:32:57,363 --> 00:33:00,227
Thanks, Dad.
That's really encouraging.

478
00:33:00,363 --> 00:33:03,124
Well, I thought you would have
brought him with you.

479
00:33:03,263 --> 00:33:07,093
Well, you know,
he wanted to come.

480
00:33:07,263 --> 00:33:11,752
It's just that, um, well,
he has this tradition, you know.

481
00:33:11,931 --> 00:33:14,488
And it's very important
to him every-

482
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:18,823
The Sox are right there! The Sox are right there!

483
00:33:18,964 --> 00:33:22,794
Where do the Sox rank
in terms of importance in your life?

484
00:33:22,931 --> 00:33:25,658
I'd say Red Sox,
sex and breathing.

485
00:33:25,797 --> 00:33:29,559
I have season tickets to Fenway Park.
I haven't missed a game in 11 years.

486
00:33:29,698 --> 00:33:33,061
I love the Red Sox. They're gonna win.
All the way this year, baby!

487
00:33:33,198 --> 00:33:36,062
Do you have a job?
Do you work for a living?

488
00:33:36,198 --> 00:33:38,663
Of course I do. Yeah, I'm a teacher.
I mold young minds.

489
00:33:38,798 --> 00:33:41,991
- Can you help these guys out?
- Can you believe this asshole?

490
00:33:50,731 --> 00:33:52,560
29th of May, Seattle, all right?

491
00:33:52,699 --> 00:33:54,597
You know what?
I gave it to the lady down at the bakery.

492
00:33:54,732 --> 00:33:57,391
Ben, all I got so far
is the 21st and 22nd, man.

493
00:33:57,532 --> 00:34:01,294
We're only on May. We've been here
for four hours. Let's try to speed this up.

494
00:34:01,432 --> 00:34:03,954
30th of May, we're still at Seattle.
Who wants a Sunday game?

495
00:34:04,099 --> 00:34:06,122
These guys can have
whatever games they want.

496
00:34:06,265 --> 00:34:08,163
All I ask for
is the first Yankee game.

497
00:34:08,299 --> 00:34:11,696
You went to six Yankee games last season,
you selfish pig bastard.

498
00:34:11,832 --> 00:34:14,161
You got to go to every great game.
Lowe's no-hitter.

499
00:34:14,333 --> 00:34:17,730
Your mother's hysterectomy?
I put her out for free, remember?

500
00:34:17,899 --> 00:34:21,854
- She had insurance for that.
- Attention, morons.

501
00:34:22,033 --> 00:34:25,931
- You went last year.
- You guys want Yankee tickets? You wanna talk Yankee tickets?

502
00:34:26,066 --> 00:34:27,326
- Yes.
- Really.

503
00:34:27,466 --> 00:34:30,261
Okay, well, I wanna
see you dance for me.

504
00:34:32,934 --> 00:34:34,797
You don't wanna dance?
I don't wanna embarrass you.

505
00:34:34,934 --> 00:34:37,456
I don't wanna embarrass you.
I'll just take this. Everyone just go.

506
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,997
I’ll go talk to some kids in the street.
I see a little bit there. That's pretty nice.

507
00:34:41,134 --> 00:34:43,725
That's it. The doctor
is giving me something.

508
00:34:43,867 --> 00:34:46,662
The doctor is giving me
some magic tapping there.

509
00:34:46,833 --> 00:34:49,424
Oh, I like that a lot.
Yeah, that's- Oh!

510
00:34:49,601 --> 00:34:52,964
Al I right, Little League, you wanna go?
You want some of this?

511
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:55,292
- How's this, Ben? This is dancing for tickets.
- I'm dancing, Ben.

512
00:34:55,434 --> 00:34:57,297
- Troy, sit on the beanbag, please.
- Hey, I started, Ben.

513
00:34:57,434 --> 00:35:01,127
Gerard, I guess you don't want them, huh?

514
00:35:01,267 --> 00:35:03,789
- This is worth tickets.
- I'm not dancing. This is totally stupid, man.

515
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:06,662
Fine. Hey, hold out
for the Royals, huh?

516
00:35:10,434 --> 00:35:12,922
You are on a total power trip,
you know that, man?

517
00:35:13,068 --> 00:35:16,397
- This is totally ridiculous, man.
- I was dancing first, remember?

518
00:35:16,535 --> 00:35:19,092
You said dance,
I started dancing.

519
00:35:19,268 --> 00:35:22,597
You call that Yankee dancing?
No, no, that's like Devil Ray dancing, okay?

520
00:35:22,735 --> 00:35:25,166
That's Devil Ray.
I'm talking about Yankee dancing.

521
00:35:25,302 --> 00:35:29,200
That's what I'm talking about. Yeah, get into it.
Yeah! How bad do you want it?

522
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:31,892
Yeah, that's nice. I love it. Come on in.

523
00:35:32,036 --> 00:35:35,195
That's it!
Come on! Whoo!

524
00:35:38,669 --> 00:35:41,793
That's right. I'm-

525
00:35:43,936 --> 00:35:46,663
Hey, what are you doing here?

526
00:35:46,802 --> 00:35:48,960
I thought you weren't coming in until tomorrow.
You look fantastic.

527
00:35:49,102 --> 00:35:51,226
- I got in last night.
- You know Troy, Kevin and Gerard.

528
00:35:51,369 --> 00:35:54,164
- Everyone else, this is Lindsey.
- Hi.

529
00:35:54,336 --> 00:35:56,268
Hi, Linds.

530
00:35:56,403 --> 00:35:59,164
- Party?
- No, it's draft day.

531
00:35:59,303 --> 00:36:02,700
This is the day we organize the whole season,
who gets to go to what game with me.

532
00:36:02,836 --> 00:36:04,926
But don't worry.
You're still going to opening day.

533
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:09,093
Yeah, thank you. Can I talk to you
about something really quickly?

534
00:36:09,237 --> 00:36:11,327
Sure, yeah, no problem.
Quick break, everybody.

535
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:14,095
There's some nice Pakistani
cold cuts there, courtesy of Mrs. Segal.

536
00:36:14,237 --> 00:36:16,930
I still don't think
they're worth two Sunday tickets.

537
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:19,160
- Whoo-hoo!
- Hey! Hey!

538
00:36:21,037 --> 00:36:22,900
Come here.

539
00:36:23,037 --> 00:36:24,900
Wait, I got you something.

540
00:36:25,037 --> 00:36:28,230
I set aside some great games
for you too.

541
00:36:28,404 --> 00:36:31,801
Hmm? For when we go
to the games together.

542
00:36:31,938 --> 00:36:33,369
Thanks.

543
00:36:33,537 --> 00:36:36,367
It's what the players wear.

544
00:36:36,504 --> 00:36:38,367
It's authentic.

545
00:36:41,537 --> 00:36:44,367
I gotta be honest.
This is getting me hot.

546
00:36:44,505 --> 00:36:49,698
Listen. Um, you know,
I saw you on ESPN.

547
00:36:49,837 --> 00:36:51,803
Oh. We looked like
morons, didn't we?

548
00:36:51,938 --> 00:36:56,064
Uh, yeah, yeah, total.
Not you so much, but-

549
00:36:56,205 --> 00:36:58,864
Well, it's very hot,
you know. It's Florida.

550
00:36:59,005 --> 00:37:00,937
You start seeing things.

551
00:37:01,072 --> 00:37:04,834
Um, you know, Ben...

552
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:10,836
I didn't realize how big
this Red Sox thing is with you.

553
00:37:10,972 --> 00:37:13,199
What?
Hey, I told you.

554
00:37:13,339 --> 00:37:15,804
See, this is-This always happens.
Every time I-

555
00:37:15,939 --> 00:37:18,905
Whoa, whoa, whoa, don't jump off a building.
We're just talking.

556
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:25,429
- Sorry. Knee jerk.
- Ben, come on, man. The cold cuts are gone.

557
00:37:25,573 --> 00:37:28,562
- Let's go in there.
- Two minutes!

558
00:37:29,906 --> 00:37:31,996
Wow. I really hit
a nerve there, didn't I?

559
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:34,628
Uh-
Yeah.

560
00:37:34,806 --> 00:37:37,203
Come here.

561
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:39,329
Thank you.

562
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:43,496
I think there's a better approach
to this whole Red Sox thing.

563
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:46,299
- Really?
- Yeah. After all, if I want this promotion...

564
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:49,633
I am going to have to push myself
really hard this summer.

565
00:37:49,774 --> 00:37:55,331
And I've never really been very good
at servicing myself, my job and a relationship.

566
00:37:55,473 --> 00:37:58,098
Wait, wait.
We're not breaking up, are we?

567
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,967
- No, no, this is a good thing.
- Okay.

568
00:38:01,107 --> 00:38:04,539
You're gonna be so consumed with all of this
that you won't feel neglected all summer.

569
00:38:04,674 --> 00:38:07,299
No, no, yeah,
I'm not gonna feel neglected.

570
00:38:07,474 --> 00:38:09,905
And I won't feel guilty
for having to do my job.

571
00:38:10,041 --> 00:38:11,631
Yeah, you shouldn't.

572
00:38:11,807 --> 00:38:15,068
So, what I'm saying is,
I think this is perfect.

573
00:38:15,208 --> 00:38:16,833
All right. Go, Sox!

574
00:38:26,174 --> 00:38:29,503
We got 'em right here, folks. Come on down.
Cut your deficit and balance your budget.

575
00:38:32,441 --> 00:38:34,304
Programs here!
Get your programs here!

576
00:38:50,008 --> 00:38:52,769
- Hi. Hi.
- Hey.

577
00:38:54,275 --> 00:38:56,934
Peanuts! CrackerJacks!

578
00:38:57,076 --> 00:39:00,235
Who wants peanuts?
Who wants CrackerJacks?

579
00:39:00,342 --> 00:39:03,433
Peanuts! CrackerJacks!
Who wants-

580
00:39:03,576 --> 00:39:05,700
It's unbelievable, right?
You can't even believe how-

581
00:39:05,842 --> 00:39:08,399
- Look, right here, go. This is it.
- Thank you.

582
00:39:08,543 --> 00:39:12,305
Is this amazing? Is this crazy?
Would you look at these seats?

583
00:39:12,443 --> 00:39:14,306
They're-They're very red.

584
00:39:14,476 --> 00:39:16,873
No, I mean, their proximity to the field.
This is Fenway Park.

585
00:39:17,009 --> 00:39:19,873
- Oh.
- You can't buy these seats. You have to, like, inherit them.

586
00:39:20,009 --> 00:39:22,907
It's like a guy offered me $100,000
for these once.

587
00:39:23,044 --> 00:39:26,168
- And you didn't sell them?
- No, if I ever need the money that bad...

588
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:29,140
I can always call up a rich old lady
and give her some sweet lovin', you know?

589
00:39:29,277 --> 00:39:31,140
That's what I'm all about.
Hey, what's up, Al?

590
00:39:31,277 --> 00:39:33,799
- How you doing?
- I'm on dialysis.

591
00:39:33,944 --> 00:39:36,535
Right on, buddy.
Hey, Al, this is Lindsey.

592
00:39:36,677 --> 00:39:38,869
Hi. Al Waterman.
Here, have a sponge.

593
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:40,999
- Thank you.
- Al is the first guy I ever met...

594
00:39:41,144 --> 00:39:43,007
- at my first Red Sox game ever.
- Really?

595
00:39:43,144 --> 00:39:46,133
Yeah, he's aged horribly.
Hey, the Belnaps.

596
00:39:46,277 --> 00:39:48,606
- This is Artie. Viv. This is Lindsey.
- Hello.

597
00:39:48,778 --> 00:39:50,641
- Hi, Lindsey.
- Hello.

598
00:39:50,778 --> 00:39:52,767
- Been divorced 20 years, still share the seats.
- Really.

599
00:39:52,945 --> 00:39:54,808
- Hey, Ben.
- Sheri!

600
00:39:54,945 --> 00:39:57,467
- How you doing? Where's Teresa?
- She's right here.

601
00:39:57,611 --> 00:40:00,168
Oh, my God. What happened?
You look fantastic!

602
00:40:00,312 --> 00:40:03,436
I lost 200 pounds.
I had my stomach stapled shut.

603
00:40:03,578 --> 00:40:06,476
- A doctor or you did it yourself?
- Oh, real funny.

604
00:40:06,611 --> 00:40:08,769
Hey!

605
00:40:10,911 --> 00:40:12,843
This is quite a little group
you have here.

606
00:40:12,978 --> 00:40:15,808
Well, it's my summer family.

607
00:40:26,845 --> 00:40:31,300
Let's hear it for Jordan Leandre.

608
00:40:31,446 --> 00:40:35,344
Ladies and gentlemen,
throwing out the first ball today...

609
00:40:35,479 --> 00:40:38,672
New England's own Stephen King.

610
00:40:41,646 --> 00:40:43,703
Right down the middle.

611
00:40:47,947 --> 00:40:50,640
Did you tell Schuyler?
Okay, al I right, listen.

612
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:54,212
Um, excuse me.
What time is the game over?

613
00:40:54,346 --> 00:40:57,675
Uh, it's not like a Broadway musical
where it ends with a big Hawaiian number.

614
00:40:57,813 --> 00:41:00,244
It's like you’re missing
all the ambience and all the fun.

615
00:41:00,347 --> 00:41:02,210
- I know.
- The players are right there.

616
00:41:02,347 --> 00:41:05,313
I have a meeting at 5:30 and had to
leave work at noon to meet you here...

617
00:41:05,447 --> 00:41:08,038
- so my people aren't prepared.
- Right. Okay.

618
00:41:10,947 --> 00:41:12,936
You know what?
I left work early...

619
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:15,705
so you're gonna have to figure it out
for yourself, and I'll call you later.

620
00:41:15,847 --> 00:41:18,904
Wakefield.

621
00:41:27,547 --> 00:41:29,536
That's a foul.

622
00:41:29,714 --> 00:41:32,612
- What makes that a foul?
- See that foul pole there?

623
00:41:32,747 --> 00:41:36,110
That's Pesky's Pole.
That's this guy Johnny Pesky.

624
00:41:45,481 --> 00:41:46,504
Yeah!

625
00:42:01,015 --> 00:42:03,708
Hey, what are you doing
on Saturday?

626
00:42:03,882 --> 00:42:05,745
Mm, you tell me.

627
00:42:08,249 --> 00:42:10,339
- You know what's really great about baseball?
- Hmm?

628
00:42:10,482 --> 00:42:15,039
You can't fake it. Anything else in life,
you don't have to be great in-

629
00:42:15,182 --> 00:42:17,409
business, music, art-
I mean, you can get lucky.

630
00:42:17,549 --> 00:42:19,810
- Really?
- Yeah, you can fool everyone for a while, you know?

631
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:21,813
It's like- Not- Not baseball.

632
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:23,973
You can either hit a curveball
or you can't.

633
00:42:24,116 --> 00:42:26,809
- That's the way it works, you know?
- Hmm.

634
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:31,473
You could have a lucky day, sure,
but you can't have a lucky career.

635
00:42:31,616 --> 00:42:34,582
It's a little like math.
It's orderly.

636
00:42:34,749 --> 00:42:38,010
Win or lose, it's fair.
It all adds up.

637
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:42,309
It's, like, not as confusing
or as ambiguous as, uh-

638
00:42:42,450 --> 00:42:45,280
- Life?
- Yeah.

639
00:42:45,417 --> 00:42:47,609
It's- It's safe.

640
00:42:50,984 --> 00:42:53,142
Oh, yeah! Yeah!

641
00:42:58,418 --> 00:42:59,940
- Hey.
- Hi.

642
00:43:00,084 --> 00:43:01,947
What, did you buy out
the bookstore?

643
00:43:02,084 --> 00:43:03,947
Actually, I bought every book
they had on the Red Sox...

644
00:43:04,084 --> 00:43:06,641
because I'm tired of being
the most ignorant person here.

645
00:43:06,817 --> 00:43:09,976
Now who is
Carl Yaz-a-strezem-

646
00:43:10,151 --> 00:43:13,446
Yastrzemski.

647
00:43:13,585 --> 00:43:15,948
- She's not a genius, this one.
- No.

648
00:43:16,085 --> 00:43:21,449
Johnny Damon!
You got the sweetest ass in the league!

649
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:25,541
Very nice.

650
00:43:28,018 --> 00:43:31,211
Do you believe in this?
"The Curse of the Bambino"?

651
00:43:31,352 --> 00:43:34,341
- Hey, that's not funny. That's enough of that.
- But Babe Ruth was the Bambino.

652
00:43:34,485 --> 00:43:36,348
That's right.
He played for the Red Sox.

653
00:43:36,485 --> 00:43:38,973
They were great.
I mean, they were the Yankees.

654
00:43:39,118 --> 00:43:42,675
They won the World Series
in 1912, 1915...

655
00:43:42,852 --> 00:43:44,784
1916, 1918.

656
00:43:44,953 --> 00:43:47,316
They were royalty.
The elite.

657
00:43:47,452 --> 00:43:50,384
Al should know. He was there actually.
He's 136 years old.

658
00:43:50,552 --> 00:43:55,143
He looks great for his age.
1919, their miserable, greedy pig of a boss...

659
00:43:55,286 --> 00:43:58,649
decides to sell Babe Ruth to the Yankees
to finance a Broadway musical.

660
00:43:58,786 --> 00:44:01,343
No, No, Nanette.
I would never ever see that piece of crap.

661
00:44:01,486 --> 00:44:06,043
And since 1918, the Red Sox
have not won a World Series.

662
00:44:06,186 --> 00:44:08,378
Yeah, the Yankees have won 26.

663
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:12,384
And the thing is the Sox don't just lose,
they raise it to an art form.

664
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:14,781
Tony C.,
best young player in baseball...

665
00:44:14,954 --> 00:44:18,784
catches one in the eye at 22,
he's finished at 26.

666
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:22,044
Armbrister runs into Carlton Fisk,
costs us the Series.

667
00:44:22,187 --> 00:44:24,119
Bucky friggin' Dent.

668
00:44:24,254 --> 00:44:27,220
You remember the time
Roger Moret went catatonic?

669
00:44:27,354 --> 00:44:29,411
The grounds crew had to carry him out
in a wheelbarrow.

670
00:44:29,554 --> 00:44:31,417
Buckner.

671
00:44:31,554 --> 00:44:33,849
Grady Little sticking
with Pedro in the eighth inning.

672
00:44:33,987 --> 00:44:37,544
Ooh, stop it.
You're killing me here.

673
00:44:37,688 --> 00:44:40,949
And that, milady,
is the Curse of the Bambino.

674
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:44,519
Number 19, Gabe Kapler.

675
00:44:53,188 --> 00:44:56,585
Okay, I'm ready.
Let's go meet Mom and Dad.

676
00:45:00,021 --> 00:45:01,884
Nothing.

677
00:45:02,021 --> 00:45:05,612
- A laugh? A giggle?
- This is not a man's closet.

678
00:45:05,755 --> 00:45:08,243
- What do you mean?
- You have one pair of dress shoes.

679
00:45:08,388 --> 00:45:11,047
You're like a man-boy-
half man, half boy.

680
00:45:11,188 --> 00:45:13,619
You should see the way
my sister's husband dresses.

681
00:45:13,755 --> 00:45:17,914
He had a professional come in
and do his closet. It's like suit, suit, suit-

682
00:45:18,056 --> 00:45:20,248
All right, okay, okay.
I see what this is all about.

683
00:45:20,423 --> 00:45:23,116
You want your parents to like me
more than they like your brother-in-law.

684
00:45:24,423 --> 00:45:27,253
No, it's not-Yes!

685
00:45:27,389 --> 00:45:32,753
Is it so horrible that
I want my parents to like you?

686
00:45:34,623 --> 00:45:38,282
Okay. I think we have enough stuff
in this closet. We can fool 'em.

687
00:45:38,423 --> 00:45:40,286
He looks like a skunk.

688
00:45:40,423 --> 00:45:42,412
You're the one that told me
to grow it out.

689
00:45:42,556 --> 00:45:46,079
Well, what else could I say?
It looked ridiculous on you. A man your age-

690
00:45:46,224 --> 00:45:48,849
Now, I understand that you're a teacher, right?
You were?

691
00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:50,853
Yes, for 27 years.

692
00:45:50,990 --> 00:45:53,251
- And, okay, now you’re the principal, right?
- Mm-hmm.

693
00:45:53,390 --> 00:45:56,356
And you-
Did you ever tell me what your dad does?

694
00:45:56,524 --> 00:46:00,581
- I sell golf carts.
- Wow. Okay, that gives us nothing to talk about.

695
00:46:00,757 --> 00:46:02,620
I don't really know much about it.

696
00:46:02,757 --> 00:46:05,723
That's funny, 'cause every other guy
she's gone out with...

697
00:46:05,857 --> 00:46:08,049
has tried to get
a free golf cart out of me.

698
00:46:08,190 --> 00:46:11,553
No, I like golf. Great sport.
It's just I don't really get out much, you know?

699
00:46:11,691 --> 00:46:13,020
- We love it.
- Yeah?

700
00:46:13,158 --> 00:46:15,215
They play all the time.

701
00:46:15,357 --> 00:46:17,822
We tried to get on the country club here,
but it's very difficult.

702
00:46:17,958 --> 00:46:21,446
It's almost impossible. I had to call
the manufacturer of my golf carts...

703
00:46:21,591 --> 00:46:24,284
- a guy named Dave Johnson, and said-
- Jensen.

704
00:46:24,425 --> 00:46:26,617
- No, Dave- Dave Johnson.
- Jensen.

705
00:46:26,791 --> 00:46:29,313
- Jensen?
- Hi. Sorry we’re late. He was watching the Red Sox game.

706
00:46:29,491 --> 00:46:32,355
- How'd they do?
- No, no. La, la, la, la, la!

707
00:46:32,491 --> 00:46:34,354
- Help me! Help me! Help me!
- What's wrong?

708
00:46:34,491 --> 00:46:37,389
Oh, help me! Help me!
Help me! La la la la!

709
00:46:37,525 --> 00:46:39,854
La la la la. La la la la.

710
00:46:39,992 --> 00:46:41,855
Okay. Okay.

711
00:46:41,992 --> 00:46:44,219
It was awesome.
Struck out the side.

712
00:46:44,358 --> 00:46:47,482
Okay, it stopped.
It stopped. Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

713
00:46:49,459 --> 00:46:51,686
- Whew!
- Um-

714
00:46:51,825 --> 00:46:54,814
- Thank you.
- Yeah. Ben tapes the Red Sox games...

715
00:46:54,959 --> 00:46:56,822
so he doesn't wanna know
the score.

716
00:46:56,959 --> 00:47:01,051
And he can't cover his own ears
'cause he's got lobster fingers, so I do it.

717
00:47:02,226 --> 00:47:04,089
That's sweet.

718
00:47:08,693 --> 00:47:11,716
- Hey, how'd it go last night?
- Fabulous.

719
00:47:11,859 --> 00:47:14,222
Mr. Myerson wants to see you.

720
00:47:14,359 --> 00:47:17,847
Oh, God. If one of the windows would open,
I would jump.

721
00:47:17,993 --> 00:47:19,754
And your mom's on line one.

722
00:47:21,227 --> 00:47:26,955
Hi, Mom. Hi. Listen, where are you?
Can I call you back?

723
00:47:27,093 --> 00:47:29,150
What? You had a 10:00 a. m. flight.

724
00:47:33,193 --> 00:47:35,715
- My Ben?
- Yes, he has been great.

725
00:47:35,894 --> 00:47:38,883
He took us out to breakfast.
Right now he's washing your father's balls.

726
00:47:39,061 --> 00:47:41,219
What?

727
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:44,392
- Here's one.
- Thanks, Ben.

728
00:47:44,527 --> 00:47:46,992
He got us a 10:00 a. m.
tee time at the country club.

729
00:47:47,127 --> 00:47:50,559
How?

730
00:47:50,694 --> 00:47:53,955
One of his student's fathers
has something to do with the sprinklers.

731
00:47:54,094 --> 00:47:56,083
- Can I talk to him for a second?
- Oh, sure.

732
00:47:56,228 --> 00:47:58,160
Benny? Lindsey.

733
00:47:58,294 --> 00:48:00,384
Oh, thanks.
Hi, Linds.

734
00:48:00,528 --> 00:48:03,255
Hey, what are you doing?

735
00:48:03,394 --> 00:48:05,053
Took a sick day.

736
00:48:06,861 --> 00:48:09,985
All right.
Well, I'll see you tonight then.

737
00:48:10,162 --> 00:48:12,185
- All right. Bye-bye.
- Honey-

738
00:48:12,361 --> 00:48:16,487
Uh, sweetheart,
don't talk in my backswing.

739
00:48:16,628 --> 00:48:19,219
- Well, you were lined up wrong.
- I wasn't lined up, I-

740
00:48:19,362 --> 00:48:21,691
Please, don't talk in my backswing.
You know better than that.

741
00:48:21,828 --> 00:48:25,089
Just take a mulligan.
Lighten up.

742
00:48:25,229 --> 00:48:27,786
- He's so short with me.
- I know. I know. But you know what?

743
00:48:27,928 --> 00:48:30,553
- You talked in his backswing. Did you talk in his backswing?
- Yes, I did.

744
00:48:30,729 --> 00:48:33,354
- Don't even look at him. Look this way. Let him swing.
- Okay.

745
00:48:51,029 --> 00:48:53,221
Manny! Manny! Manny!

746
00:50:01,465 --> 00:50:03,397
Oh.

747
00:50:11,266 --> 00:50:14,289
She handled a project for a food
service company like yours a few months ago.

748
00:50:14,433 --> 00:50:19,127
Gave them a model predicting
the impact of every possibility.

749
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:21,129
- Sounds like what I need.
- Morning.

750
00:50:21,299 --> 00:50:23,231
You'll love her.
This lady is a dynamo.

751
00:50:23,399 --> 00:50:25,626
Unstop... pable.

752
00:50:30,067 --> 00:50:33,760
When she wakes up, I wanna see her.

753
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:35,832
Well, let's go for a coffee.

754
00:50:35,967 --> 00:50:39,058
You know what's happening here?
You're being colonized.

755
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:42,257
- What?
- Colonized. It's like- It's like in the old days.

756
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:46,389
When the French and the English
would go into Asia and Africa...

757
00:50:46,534 --> 00:50:50,863
and they'd raise their flags and they'd impose
their culture and they'd colonize.

758
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,659
It's like, Sarah, when you cut your hair off
because that guy liked short hair.

759
00:50:54,834 --> 00:50:56,766
Wait a minute.
I mean, you guys are married.

760
00:50:56,934 --> 00:50:59,866
Isn't that a part of it,
accommodating each other?

761
00:51:00,001 --> 00:51:02,296
You know, how many kids
are we gonna have?

762
00:51:02,434 --> 00:51:06,025
Where are we gonna live?
What pizza place are we gonna order from?

763
00:51:06,168 --> 00:51:08,031
Doesn't it require
some pliability?

764
00:51:08,168 --> 00:51:11,691
Because maybe that's something
I've been lacking in my life.

765
00:51:11,834 --> 00:51:13,857
Isn't it affecting your work?

766
00:51:14,001 --> 00:51:16,899
No, not so much.

767
00:51:17,034 --> 00:51:18,932
You know what I just realized?

768
00:51:19,068 --> 00:51:21,329
You're rooting
for her relationship to fail.

769
00:51:21,468 --> 00:51:23,093
- No.
- What?

770
00:51:23,235 --> 00:51:25,098
- That's right.
- Why would I do that?

771
00:51:25,235 --> 00:51:27,700
Never mind.

772
00:51:29,168 --> 00:51:31,191
No. No, come on, tell me.

773
00:51:33,868 --> 00:51:38,493
All right. You and Lindsey are both
very competitive, especially with each other.

774
00:51:38,635 --> 00:51:41,964
- She's more competitive than I am.
- I am not.

775
00:51:42,102 --> 00:51:44,499
And when you were both starting out,
you were the more successful one.

776
00:51:44,636 --> 00:51:47,999
But now Lindsey's career
has skyrocketed, so she's more successful.

777
00:51:48,135 --> 00:51:51,294
But you've had the personal success,
the marriage.

778
00:51:51,436 --> 00:51:54,663
And if Lindsey gets that too,
then she's definitely the winner...

779
00:51:54,803 --> 00:51:56,632
so you’re rooting against her.

780
00:51:59,202 --> 00:52:02,964
Oh, my God. What did I do?

781
00:52:03,136 --> 00:52:06,000
- What the-
- That's it.

782
00:52:06,136 --> 00:52:06,658
We are so not coming here anymore.

783
00:52:07,658 --> 00:52:17,658
