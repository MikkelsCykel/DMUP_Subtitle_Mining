1
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:46,175
(score playing)

2
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:01,586
All things are intrinsically connected,

3
00:01:01,628 --> 00:01:04,028
no matter how different
they may appear.

4
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:07,090
Hi. You know me... Robert Axle.

5
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:09,897
As a fabricator, I bring existing,

6
00:01:09,936 --> 00:01:12,632
often very different items together,

7
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:16,267
maximizing their atomic
and molecular potential,

8
00:01:16,309 --> 00:01:18,334
making ordinary inventions

9
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:20,573
infinitely more prolific.

10
00:01:20,613 --> 00:01:22,911
(crowd cheering)

11
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:31,055
Thank you very much.
We've got a big show today.

12
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,082
I've got lots of new items
to tell you about.

13
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:36,323
In fact, you all remember
the Robert Axle Light-O-Saurus.

14
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:39,854
Part humidifier, part night light,

15
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:43,801
the Light-O-Saurus connects
a child's need to feel safe at night

16
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:46,328
with a parent's need
to keep them healthy.

17
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:49,899
Then of course there was
the Robert Axle Pepper-Cam,

18
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:52,878
enabling us to pepper-spray
our assailants

19
00:01:52,912 --> 00:01:55,881
and photograph them
at the same time.

20
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:59,180
(cheering and applause)

21
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:01,619
And now introducing

22
00:02:01,654 --> 00:02:04,748
my most inspired fabrication to date...

23
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,453
the Robert Axle Ab Clicker.

24
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:10,327
You can channel-surf,
watch your favorite programs,

25
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:11,830
adjust the volume...

26
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:14,197
all at the same time
that you are getting

27
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:16,327
that six-pack of abs.

28
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:18,963
You call the number right below
on the screen here...

29
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:21,235
1-800-AXLES-ARMY.

30
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:25,711
You'll get 10% off on the Robert Axle
revolutionary Ab Clicker!

31
00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:27,736
(cheering and applause)

32
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,271
Thank you. Thank you for coming.
Thank you.

33
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:35,748
Thank you. Thank you.

34
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,523
(crows cawing)

35
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,131
# Call me #

36
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,838
# Irresponsible #

37
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:03,281
# Call me unreliable #

38
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:06,183
# Throw in #

39
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:10,451
# Undependable too #

40
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:17,687
- # Do my foolish alibis... #
- (horn honks)

41
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:23,430
# Bore you? #

42
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:26,233
- # Well, I'm not too clever... #
- (baby crying)

43
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:30,834
# I just adore you. #

44
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:38,511
Cashier: 17, 18, 19, 20.

45
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:42,979
- (bone cracks)
- (screams)

46
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:47,618
(cashier muttering)
There's your change.

47
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:55,494
# Call me irresponsible #

48
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:59,596
# Yes, I'm unreliable #

49
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:03,234
# But it's undeniably true. #

50
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:07,804
Hey, Robert Axle!
I see you!

51
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:10,145
(grunts)

52
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:15,353
Stupid Ab Clicker piece of crap!
Robert Axle!

53
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:20,658
"Depraved indifference
to human life."

54
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:23,218
(chuckles) What the hell
does that even mean?

55
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,356
It means that people
are too lazy to do sit-ups

56
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:27,389
so they stick their fingers
in places

57
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,401
they shouldn't have stuck
their fingers.

58
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,027
All right.

59
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,595
The good news there, Bob...

60
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,938
I got you a job.
Family Mart...

61
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:39,069
the fourth-largest discount
consumer retailer in the nation.

62
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,774
The assistant general manager
is Troy Coangelo.

63
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:43,714
You're to see him tomorrow
at 9:00 AM sharp.

64
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,776
You do realize
that I built my own

65
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:50,186
$1.6 billion company
from scratch?

66
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:52,418
You're still a felon, hmm?

67
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:55,518
A felon who's had nothing
but eight years to brainstorm.

68
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:59,190
And all I need is one good idea
that puts me right back on top.

69
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:03,225
62% of ex-cons wind up back in prison
within five years.

70
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:05,703
I just got out early
for good behavior.

71
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:08,639
Could you let me enjoy that for two
minutes before you start your buzzkill?

72
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:13,077
Claire Elizabeth Axle...
that your daughter?

73
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:14,272
Yes.

74
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,077
And she knows you're gonna be
staying with her?

75
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:19,209
Yes. And it's Claire Elizabeth now.

76
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:20,947
Smart...

77
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,922
dropped the name.

78
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,014
Driver:
There you go, sir.

79
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:01,049
Thanks.

80
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:34,759
Young Claire: Daddy!

81
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:40,427
Daddy.

82
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:43,958
Daddy, it's perfect.

83
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:47,568
- It's perfect. It's perfect.
- I'm so glad you like it.

84
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:49,666
- How did you know?
- How did I know?

85
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:52,234
I'm your father. I'm supposed to know
what to get you for your birthday.

86
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:55,611
I have an idea.
Will you ride with me?

87
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:58,048
Honey, I can't right now.
I'm in the middle of doing some work.

88
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,917
Come on, just one ride.
You have time for one ride, Dad.

89
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:03,513
Honey, you know I'm not much
of a bike guy, all right?

90
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:06,252
So you ride your bike and I'll come
and find you a little bit later.

91
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:13,856
Go on, go on, go on.

92
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:18,460
Happy birthday, baby.

93
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:37,319
- (synthesizer playing)
- (clears throat)

94
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:40,120
(sings out of tune)
# Maybe if there's something wrong #

95
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:44,562
# Well, I don't like
how you wait until I'm gone #

96
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:47,157
# To find a way... #

97
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,963
(rings doorbell)

98
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:56,770
(synthesizer stops)

99
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,834
I'm recording.

100
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:08,281
Jesus Christ,

101
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,312
you look like hell.

102
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:12,256
When did you start smoking?

103
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:15,089
Around the same time you became
a total self-absorbed prick.

104
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:18,722
You feel good frolicking around
with $362 million of my money?

105
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:21,665
It's not your money.
It's half your money.

106
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:25,603
The rest went to the poor innocent
victims whose fingers you chipped off.

107
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:28,630
You wouldn't have this house
or this life if it weren't for me.

108
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:31,040
If you think Jerry and I
are gonna give you jackshit

109
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:33,841
after all you did
and did not do for me and Claire...

110
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,541
Whoa whoa, who's Jerry?

111
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:37,674
Jerry King...
Lorraine's new husband

112
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:40,447
and a huge fan of yours.

113
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:42,852
(giggles)

114
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:44,356
Axle's Army?

115
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,756
I'm a soldier.

116
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:48,760
- Hey, baby.
- Hey, baby.

117
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,020
Jerry's a forest ranger.

118
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:54,658
He protects the land from the people
and the people from the land.

119
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,691
Well, that is such a coincidence,

120
00:08:56,736 --> 00:09:00,172
'cause I made about $40 million
on the Robert Axle Swing 'n' Whack.

121
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,231
Part weed-whacker,
part sand wedge.

122
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:04,004
- Now you can...
- Trim your lawn

123
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,307
and shots off your short game
with the same device.

124
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:08,336
Yes, sir.

125
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:11,578
So, Ranger Jerr,

126
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:13,881
since you're the new
man of the house,

127
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,480
you think you could let me
crash here for a couple of nights?

128
00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:18,717
- Uh...
- Blow me.

129
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:21,783
Sorry.

130
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:24,921
Yeah, it's all right.
Just let me take my car and go.

131
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:28,661
- Can I have the keys, Lorraine?
- (laughs)

132
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:33,270
Don't tell me she gave you my car.
Did she give you my car?

133
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:34,898
It was a birthday present.

134
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:37,902
I could give you a ride.

135
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:39,935
Whee.

136
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:42,914
I love this sweet bitch.

137
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:45,383
Oh baby.

138
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,784
Come on, bring it to Daddy. Yeah.

139
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,414
Hey, look,

140
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:53,948
your boy got you
a little mini storage, all right?

141
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:56,359
It's on Fifth and Plymouth...

142
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:57,919
some old prototypes,

143
00:09:57,964 --> 00:10:00,194
Axle memorabilia,
personal effects and such.

144
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:03,759
Wait a minute.
Let me get this straight.

145
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:06,135
You're living in my house.
You're humping my ex.

146
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:10,108
You're driving my car. And you
risk everything for my memorabilia?

147
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:12,770
Do you know why most people
hate buzzards, Axle?

148
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:14,302
No, I don't.

149
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:16,747
Because they feed
on carcasses...

150
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:19,945
a fact that brings blame
for a killing

151
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:22,352
that they weren't even
responsible for.

152
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:26,016
The buzzard
is unjustly persecuted.

153
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:31,686
Right.

154
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:37,462
(grinding transmission)

155
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,463
(doorbell rings)

156
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:44,475
Aww.

157
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:47,809
You guys, there's a homeless man
at the door.

158
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:53,308
All I have is two ones and a 20.
Should I just give him the 20?

159
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:55,479
- We're not letting a nutjob in.
- We're not letting him in.

160
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:57,250
- I'm gonna slide it under the door.
- Guys, don't.

161
00:10:57,289 --> 00:11:00,486
Calm down. Just 'cause he's homeless
doesn't mean he's dangerous.

162
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:10,759
Guys, I can handle it.
Just give me a minute, okay?

163
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:12,202
Let him in.

164
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:14,331
It's my father.

165
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:17,470
Just give me a minute.

166
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:33,147
Wow, look at you.

167
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,921
Wow.

168
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,450
Look at you.

169
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:43,092
I... I read about your girls' home.

170
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:45,831
Center for Women's Employment.

171
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:48,704
Anyway, I just thought
I'd come by and tell you...

172
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:49,969
Where are you staying?

173
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:52,910
A shelter.

174
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:55,379
A shelter, a halfway home?

175
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:58,577
It's a shelter-home... a hybrid thing.

176
00:11:58,617 --> 00:12:00,642
Well, it must be that one
on Fulton and Sixth.

177
00:12:00,686 --> 00:12:03,621
I heard it's supposed to be nice.
They got new cots last year.

178
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:05,988
This is stupid.

179
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:08,619
I shouldn't have come here at all.
I don't know why I did.

180
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:10,959
Obviously you've got your own life,
your own career.

181
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:12,520
Wait.

182
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,056
Wait here.

183
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:41,526
Does he need a place to stay?
'Cause he could stay here.

184
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,154
He's not gonna stay here.
He does not deserve to be around you.

185
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:46,391
You gotta shut him down,
wall him off.

186
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,866
Donna: I mean, he loves you.
He came to see you.

187
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:52,064
Phoebe: How does that mean he loves her?
He's a user.

188
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:03,380
Take this.
It's the rainy season.

189
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:05,007
You'll need it.

190
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:07,917
- (door closes)
- Thanks.

191
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:10,114
(insects chirping)

192
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,181
(people coughing)

193
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,929
(keys jingle)

194
00:13:56,936 --> 00:14:00,337
I'll give you one month.
Let's go.

195
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:14,150
- I can pay rent. It's not a problem.
- I don't want rent money.

196
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:16,279
Robert: Okay, well, at least let me
pay for some groceries.

197
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:19,553
I don't want your grocery money.
You'll get a job... a real job,

198
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:22,618
'cause at the end of 30 days
you're on your own.

199
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,370
Hi. I'm Donna.

200
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:39,468
It's so nice to meet you.

201
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:41,672
Claire and I have been roommates
since freshman year

202
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,841
and I feel like I know
nothing about you.

203
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,748
Well, I wish I could sit
on my couch, but I can't,

204
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:47,718
'cause Captain Caveman's on it.

205
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:49,618
- Who's that?
- That's just Phoebe.

206
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:52,180
You know, I'm studying for my LSATs.
Dad wants me to be a lawyer.

207
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:54,158
He says it doesn't matter what kind.
What do you think?

208
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:56,457
I don't know.
Where's Phoebe from?

209
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:59,123
She's from Craigslist, back when
we were looking for a roommate.

210
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:01,564
Now not so much.

211
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:04,933
(quietly)
She's a lesbian.

212
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,938
- Really?
- Yeah.

213
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:08,564
I wouldn't have guessed that.

214
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:13,673
Oh, Claire, these eggs
are so good...

215
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:16,044
not too hard, not too soft.
They're right where you want to be.

216
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,810
You really think that you can
come in here

217
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:20,011
and you can compliment her eggs,
and that makes up for the fact

218
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:21,917
that you've been MIA
for the better part of her life?

219
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:24,252
Phoebe, can we not get into
the whole MIA thing right now? Okay?

220
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:27,691
Do you need a bike? 'Cause if you do,
you could totally borrow mine.

221
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:29,717
Donna, it's okay.
He doesn't need your bike.

222
00:15:31,897 --> 00:15:35,162
So, Phoebe, what do you do
for a living?

223
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,725
- She's a gym teacher.
- Oh, that's interesting.

224
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,500
You know, you don't meet
that many lesbians who teach gym.

225
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:42,700
I'd rather be a lesbian gym teacher
than the world's

226
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:45,209
preeminent infomercial douchebag.

227
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:47,235
Hey, enough. Enough.

228
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,372
You know, I love inventions.

229
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:52,145
The Ped Egg, the ThighMaster,
the George Foreman Grill...

230
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:53,776
I mean, they're amazing.

231
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:55,514
Donna, he didn't invent those.

232
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:59,217
Also I'm not really what you call
an inventor, so to speak.

233
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:01,749
It's more... the term is
"fabricator."

234
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,318
You mean liar?

235
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:05,193
Actually, according to Webster,

236
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,824
"liar" is the fourth definition
of "fabricator."

237
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:09,766
I can't believe you remember that.

238
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,736
Donna:
Well, what's the first?

239
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:14,568
Well, the first definition is
"someone who creates

240
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:19,066
by combining existing,
very often diverse standardized parts

241
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:21,579
and brings them together."
That's what I do.

242
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:23,478
Keep telling yourself
that bullshit, Bob.

243
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:26,608
Thanks for breakfast.

244
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,120
And I'd love to stay here
and have this pleasant chat,

245
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:32,385
but the world's most famous
infomercial douche

246
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:34,915
doesn't want to be late
for his first day on the job.

247
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,827
- You have a job?
- Yeah, Family Mart.

248
00:16:37,863 --> 00:16:41,264
What do they have you doing? Mopping
the floors or cleaning the toilets?

249
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,291
Phoebe.

250
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,930
- (quiet music playing)
- (woman announcing over P.A.)

251
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:52,472
Robert Axle, as I live and breathe.

252
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,479
Uh, Troy.

253
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,913
Troy Coangelo.

254
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:59,747
Hey, you're 19 minutes late,
but don't sweat it, man.

255
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:02,253
I can rig the time stamp
on the punch-in clock

256
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:04,312
to make sure you get credit
for a full shift.

257
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:06,654
Great. Thanks.

258
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:09,388
Oh, and here is a pen and a pad

259
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:11,521
in case you get
one of your great ideas.

260
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:16,225
Oh, and we got guys
in the break room

261
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:19,795
to get you a foot massage, latte...
whatever you need.

262
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:21,897
I thought this was
a felon reform program.

263
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:24,966
- You know what "felon reform" means?
- Apparently not.

264
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:28,002
It means you represent
a monumental risk to my company.

265
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,242
And it also means
if you show up late,

266
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:32,580
forget to shave or so much
as breathe at the wrong time,

267
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:35,052
I have full authority
to terminate your employment,

268
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:37,078
no warning, no cause,
no pink slip,

269
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:39,113
just sayonara, kemosabe.

270
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:42,093
Wait, I'm confused.
Am I fired?

271
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:44,357
No, but you're sure as hell
not starting today.

272
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:47,388
So when am I starting?

273
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:51,335
Whenever you can show up on time.
Presumably tomorrow.

274
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,540
Whoa, what are you doing?

275
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,568
Hi honey.
Well, you know what?

276
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:03,877
I saw this leaning up against the wall
and I decided to hang it up for you.

277
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,510
Well, did it ever occur to you
that I didn't want it hung?

278
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:08,247
No, I didn't think about that fact.

279
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:09,982
You know what?
I can take it down just as easily.

280
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:12,718
Oh my God, you got fired,
didn't you?

281
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,522
Fired? Good Lord, no.

282
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:17,722
As a matter of fact,
this is the first day

283
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:20,459
that I feel I've done an honest
day's work in a long long time.

284
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:23,491
In fact, I still had enough time
to come home, reconfigure the fish tank

285
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:25,526
and look at this...
something I learned in prison...

286
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:28,506
I taught one of these guys
how to shoot a basket. Which one is he?

287
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,030
Where is my mail?

288
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:34,671
Oh, well, I made you a terrific new
mail recycling station right over there.

289
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:37,375
Now you can open your mail,
drop in the bits you don't want

290
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:41,182
right into that basket without having
to walk all the way to the kitchen.

291
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,848
Yeah, it's probably more comfortable
for you to be in your own room.

292
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:47,450
But, you know, I can bring the whole
mail opening system into your bedroom.

293
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:49,927
- Would you stop?
- Stop what?

294
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,725
Stop trying to be Joe Dad.

295
00:18:53,398 --> 00:18:55,389
I'm sorry. You're right.

296
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:57,868
I'm done. I'm done.
I'm sorry.

297
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,140
What was that?

298
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:05,439
It's the carbon monoxide detector
I installed.

299
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:07,810
What was that?

300
00:19:07,846 --> 00:19:11,282
Our new carbon monoxide detector.

301
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:14,808
Carbon monoxide?
Nobody smokes in this house.

302
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:28,290
- Donna. (knocks)
- Yeah?

303
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,324
- Donna.
- Yeah, come in.

304
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:36,039
Well, it's official.
Everyone in this house hates me.

305
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:38,065
No, I don't hate you.

306
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,771
Actually I've been looking
at your case

307
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:41,472
and you gotta help me
understand something.

308
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:43,811
You were charged for depraved
indifference to human life,

309
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,339
which requires recklessness.

310
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:47,750
Wasn't it the victims
who were reckless, not you?

311
00:19:47,786 --> 00:19:49,981
I mean, they are the ones
who stuck their fingers in this...

312
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,013
Whoa whoa whoa,
where did you get that?

313
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:54,048
Dad had one in the attic.

314
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,459
What the hell, Axle?

315
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,367
Argh!

316
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:23,211
(sighs)

317
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:59,749
Phoebe: Face or nuts?

318
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:01,782
- What?
- You violated my fish,

319
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:04,091
so I get a free shot.
Where do you want it? Face or nuts?

320
00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:06,256
I didn't violate your fish.
I reconfigured the fish tank.

321
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:08,289
- Then I hung up the paint...
- Face or nuts?

322
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,392
Face.

323
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:12,801
Oh!

324
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:14,863
(groaning)

325
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:56,012
Excuse me, can you point me
to the bathroom?

326
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:01,383
You look like a smart guy.

327
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:04,389
Were you aware that these
Steve Leslie discoveries

328
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:06,323
were in fact discovered
by someone else?

329
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:08,849
And they're not discoveries at all.
They're fabrications.

330
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:11,488
So there's very little
discovering going on.

331
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:13,521
Dude, I just want to know
where the bathroom is.

332
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:18,231
It's in the back left corner
of the store, behind Housewares.

333
00:22:21,873 --> 00:22:23,033
What are you doing?

334
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:26,374
I'm just trying to think of ways
that we can add value

335
00:22:26,411 --> 00:22:27,935
and make the customer
more informed.

336
00:22:27,979 --> 00:22:29,844
We? There's no we.

337
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:32,111
There's us... Family Mart,

338
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:34,880
and you... felon who should not
be talking to customers.

339
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:39,786
Oh my God.

340
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:41,816
Whoa.

341
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,534
(mutters)
You're...

342
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:53,504
I'm fried?

343
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:55,972
You're fired!

344
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:00,868
(birds chirping)

345
00:23:00,912 --> 00:23:03,073
(children playing)

346
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:28,503
Boy: Axle.

347
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:31,339
You know me?

348
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:32,673
It's on your shirt.

349
00:23:35,547 --> 00:23:37,174
Want to play some handball?

350
00:23:37,215 --> 00:23:38,682
I'm a little busy right now.

351
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:40,446
You don't look so busy to me.

352
00:23:40,485 --> 00:23:42,214
Where's your mother?

353
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:45,223
- Go talk to her.
- Please, I'm so bored.

354
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,487
You look like a nice kid, but I'm right
in the middle of something.

355
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:49,926
I'm sure handball would be
a lot of fun, but...

356
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:54,195
Okay.

357
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:02,764
Argh!

358
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:04,139
Oh.

359
00:24:05,143 --> 00:24:08,271
- You're too fancy with your feet.
- All right, all right.

360
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:10,979
Oh, interference.

361
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:13,951
- Are you accusing me of being a cheat?
- Just serve.

362
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:18,922
# You and I look good together... #

363
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:21,653
Oh, whoa whoa whoa.
What is that?

364
00:24:21,693 --> 00:24:23,752
- A kickie.
- Since when are kickies allowed?

365
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:25,786
- Mother: George.
- Gotta go. Bye.

366
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:28,891
# Let's get inside
out of this weather #

367
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:33,633
# And there is no one
loves you better #

368
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:36,197
# Than me, my dear... #

369
00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:46,146
My mom says
you need a haircut.

370
00:24:46,184 --> 00:24:48,209
What's the matter with my hair?

371
00:24:48,253 --> 00:24:51,848
You look somebody
I'm not supposed to talk to.

372
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:54,051
# Exhaustible but inefficient #

373
00:24:54,092 --> 00:24:58,791
# Following our intuition #

374
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:02,129
# To get back home #

375
00:25:04,035 --> 00:25:07,562
# To get back home again. #

376
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:19,575
(applause)

377
00:25:20,585 --> 00:25:24,248
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Robert Axle Air Cutter...

378
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:26,348
part clippers, part vacuum,

379
00:25:26,391 --> 00:25:29,326
salon-caliber haircuts
in the privacy of your own home

380
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,352
without the hairy mess

381
00:25:31,396 --> 00:25:33,296
or the heavy prices.

382
00:25:33,331 --> 00:25:37,529
(humming a tune)

383
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:40,197
(rock music playing)

384
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:50,812
Whoa, check out the new Axle.

385
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:52,840
Well, do you like it?

386
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:55,114
I was hoping it's all right. It's...

387
00:25:55,153 --> 00:25:56,711
Donna: Yeah, you look
distinguished,

388
00:25:56,755 --> 00:25:58,780
like a college professor.

389
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,883
You know, what would go good
with that midlife crisis

390
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:05,624
is an earring
or maybe a Mazda Miata.

391
00:26:05,664 --> 00:26:08,895
You know what would go great
with that winning personality of yours?

392
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:10,561
A therapist.

393
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:13,435
- Claire, where are you going?
- My mom's.

394
00:26:13,471 --> 00:26:15,405
Wait up.
I'll walk out with you.

395
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,431
Don't we have our own
washer and dryer?

396
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:20,569
We have a washer and dryer. She doesn't
want to be around you, douchebag.

397
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:23,342
(door closes)

398
00:26:23,381 --> 00:26:25,781
You realize you're playing
a plastic guitar?

399
00:26:25,817 --> 00:26:27,307
(music stops)

400
00:26:27,352 --> 00:26:29,752
- Guitar or drums?
- What?

401
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:32,313
You rag on my Rock Band, I'm gonna
kick your ass. Guitar or drums?

402
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:34,621
I didn't rag on your Rock Band.
I was making an obser...

403
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:36,490
Guitar or drums?

404
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:37,825
Guitar?

405
00:26:37,862 --> 00:26:41,389
I want to play guitar.
You can play the drums.

406
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:44,869
It makes no sense to me that you would
invite him to your fundraiser.

407
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:46,928
I cannot not invite him.

408
00:26:46,972 --> 00:26:49,770
He lives with us.
That's just rude.

409
00:26:49,808 --> 00:26:52,572
Well, you live with the fish
and you didn't invite the fish.

410
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:55,171
I did not come here
to talk about Robert Axle.

411
00:26:55,213 --> 00:26:57,773
Well, that's too bad, because
Robert Axle is gonna be the only thing

412
00:26:57,816 --> 00:27:00,182
that people are talking about
if you invite him to the gala.

413
00:27:00,218 --> 00:27:02,277
And no one is gonna be writing
a check for you

414
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,015
if they know you're affiliated
with that.

415
00:27:04,055 --> 00:27:05,420
I get it.

416
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:07,789
Oh, I forgot. I have clothes.

417
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:10,056
I have clothes to donate
to the women's center.

418
00:27:10,095 --> 00:27:12,086
Ma, it's really okay.

419
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,462
Do you remember that single mother
that you introduced me to?

420
00:27:14,499 --> 00:27:17,935
I know she's got that job interview,
so what about this for her?

421
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:21,598
Doesn't it just say,
"Hire me," "Power" and...?

422
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,471
- Oh, and you could pair it...
- Mom. Mom.

423
00:27:23,508 --> 00:27:25,271
...with this fantastic leopard.
Just look.

424
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:28,108
- Mom.
- Just look. Watch.

425
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:31,604
If we don't raise
the money we need to raise,

426
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,584
can I count on you for a loan?

427
00:27:33,618 --> 00:27:36,781
I swear to God, I'll pay you back.

428
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:40,780
I mean, you have offered
a thousand times.

429
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:42,816
And you know what?

430
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:46,194
I'm really proud of myself
that I'm not afraid to ask you for help.

431
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:49,462
It's a big step for me.

432
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:52,061
- It's gone.
- What's gone?

433
00:27:52,103 --> 00:27:55,436
The money's gone.
I'm filing for bankruptcy.

434
00:27:55,473 --> 00:27:59,603
You spent $362 million?

435
00:27:59,644 --> 00:28:01,771
Well, you know,

436
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:04,281
there were funds.

437
00:28:04,315 --> 00:28:06,306
There were mutual things.

438
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:08,046
And you know what?

439
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:10,350
There's a lot of causes
that I feel very strongly about,

440
00:28:10,388 --> 00:28:12,049
like that elephant rescue.

441
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:15,685
What about your album?
It went gold. You sold 500,000 copies.

442
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:18,093
I bought 498,000 copies myself.

443
00:28:18,129 --> 00:28:20,256
You're kidding me.

444
00:28:20,298 --> 00:28:24,598
I wanted a gold record, okay?
Is that the crime of the century?

445
00:28:25,603 --> 00:28:26,968
You're right.

446
00:28:27,005 --> 00:28:28,734
What do you mean, I'm right?

447
00:28:28,773 --> 00:28:32,004
I'm a horrible horrible mother...

448
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:33,567
horrible.

449
00:28:33,611 --> 00:28:35,602
Mom.

450
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:39,240
- (rock music playing)
- Yellow is coming.

451
00:28:39,284 --> 00:28:41,616
Yellow yellow yellow yellow,

452
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:44,588
red red, blue blue.

453
00:28:44,622 --> 00:28:46,613
Oh, this is incredible.
This is like,

454
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:48,956
feel like a rock star
in the comfort of your own home.

455
00:28:48,993 --> 00:28:51,461
This is one fabrication
I wish I could call my own.

456
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:55,364
I know. It's like a drug, isn't it?
The crowd is screaming for us.

457
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,528
Imagine this with a microphone.

458
00:29:02,373 --> 00:29:04,307
Eight years
with nothing to do but think,

459
00:29:04,342 --> 00:29:06,401
and I don't come up with one
single good idea.

460
00:29:06,444 --> 00:29:09,311
Dude, don't be so hard on yourself.
I mean, you got a good job.

461
00:29:09,347 --> 00:29:12,714
No, actually I don't anymore.
I got fired from Family Mart.

462
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,013
Blue blue, red.

463
00:29:14,052 --> 00:29:17,180
Wow, that's impressive. They have
some real derelicts working there.

464
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:20,157
And then I bust myself
trying to fix up this house.

465
00:29:20,191 --> 00:29:22,056
I even hung that painting
for Claire.

466
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:24,687
She hated it so much,
I wish I'd never done it.

467
00:29:24,729 --> 00:29:28,028
She wasn't mad. She's been trying
to hang that thing since I moved here.

468
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:39,969
All right, tell me something
about yourself

469
00:29:40,011 --> 00:29:42,309
besides the fact
that you're an angry lesbian.

470
00:29:42,347 --> 00:29:45,145
- That's all I got.
- I got that part. Something else.

471
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:48,175
(crowd cheering)

472
00:29:48,219 --> 00:29:50,414
I got fake tits when I was 30.

473
00:29:52,657 --> 00:29:54,648
They look real to me.

474
00:29:54,692 --> 00:29:56,751
That's 'cause I had
a take-back-the-night moment

475
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:59,320
and I had them yanked out
three months later.

476
00:30:00,665 --> 00:30:03,099
Wow, that just totally
threw me off rhythm.

477
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:04,465
(laughs)

478
00:30:04,502 --> 00:30:07,232
Lorraine baby, come down.
You're scaring us.

479
00:30:07,272 --> 00:30:10,070
My daughter finally needs me
and I'm broke.

480
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:12,736
It's only two stories.
She won't kill herself.

481
00:30:12,777 --> 00:30:14,210
The worst she could do
is break her leg.

482
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:15,803
No, I could crack my neck.

483
00:30:15,847 --> 00:30:17,508
Mom, I'll be okay.

484
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:19,244
I see this all the time
in the forest:

485
00:30:19,284 --> 00:30:22,048
baby bird wants to leave the nest;
mama bird gets all antsy,

486
00:30:22,086 --> 00:30:23,485
pacing, pecking.

487
00:30:23,521 --> 00:30:25,386
She thinks baby bird
doesn't know how to fly.

488
00:30:25,423 --> 00:30:26,720
And she flies.

489
00:30:26,758 --> 00:30:28,225
Does she?

490
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:29,851
Actually no.

491
00:30:29,894 --> 00:30:33,990
A lot of times she dive-bombs
into the ground, beak first.

492
00:30:34,032 --> 00:30:35,966
Okay, that's not helping.

493
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,831
I don't care about the money, Mom.

494
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:40,497
Okay, but if I come down,

495
00:30:40,538 --> 00:30:43,029
you have to promise
you're not gonna invite him.

496
00:30:43,074 --> 00:30:46,100
I will not invite him.
I promise.

497
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:51,742
All right.

498
00:31:01,492 --> 00:31:03,084
(floor creaks)

499
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:16,500
(bike horn tooting)

500
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:24,448
Stop, okay? I heard you.
What do you want?

501
00:31:24,482 --> 00:31:27,280
Hi!
(tooting horn)

502
00:31:27,318 --> 00:31:28,751
Claire!

503
00:31:28,786 --> 00:31:31,277
Yeah, I heard you.
What do you want?

504
00:31:31,322 --> 00:31:32,983
I thought we could
go for coffee.

505
00:31:33,024 --> 00:31:36,516
What?
No, you're not coming with me.

506
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:37,896
Robert: What?

507
00:31:37,897 --> 00:31:39,989
(quiet music playing)

508
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:54,205
So what is it with your mother
and this music crap?

509
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:57,612
It's not crap.
It's her thing.

510
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:04,284
So Phoebe tells me
that you sew clothes

511
00:32:04,322 --> 00:32:06,722
for the women at the center.
How long have you been doing that?

512
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:10,250
Is it okay if we don't talk?

513
00:32:10,295 --> 00:32:12,991
Just trying to start a conversation.

514
00:32:20,571 --> 00:32:24,530
I like magazines more than books.

515
00:32:24,575 --> 00:32:26,600
And I really enjoy bingo.

516
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:29,678
I like bingo.

517
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:35,716
And I've been having
rabid erotic sex since I was 15.

518
00:32:35,753 --> 00:32:38,586
I don't need any of the details.

519
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:40,386
The guy was 39.

520
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:42,120
Oh, stop it.

521
00:32:47,231 --> 00:32:48,721
You are kidding.

522
00:32:48,766 --> 00:32:50,996
Yes, I'm kidding.

523
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:58,298
Did you give me this jacket
because it's rainy season

524
00:32:58,343 --> 00:33:00,106
or because you wanted me
to look like a tool?

525
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:02,237
A little bit of both.

526
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,111
Huh.

527
00:33:09,087 --> 00:33:11,988
- Thanks.
- You're very welcome.

528
00:33:12,023 --> 00:33:14,321
Robert:
Hey, are you hungry?

529
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:16,350
Claire:
I could eat.

530
00:33:16,394 --> 00:33:18,123
Robert:
Yeah, me too.

531
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:20,824
See, some people think
jumping jacks don't do anything.

532
00:33:20,865 --> 00:33:23,959
Well, I'll tell you what, Abby... you do
these jumping jacks for 30 minutes,

533
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,937
you're gonna sweat your balls off.
This shit is hard.

534
00:33:26,971 --> 00:33:29,906
All right, now we're doing windmills.
I'll tell you what, Savannah...

535
00:33:29,941 --> 00:33:32,068
you want a boy to text you,
you do these windmills.

536
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:34,544
You want a date to the prom,
do windmills.

537
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:37,912
Andre, you want the girls
to think you're hot, do windmills.

538
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:40,543
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

539
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:43,520
Sorry. I hate to disturb you
in the middle of your class,

540
00:33:43,554 --> 00:33:46,990
but I just... I need your help.

541
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:49,186
I'm really busy
enriching these kids' lives.

542
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:51,218
No, that's great.
I just need...

543
00:33:51,262 --> 00:33:54,754
(blows whistle)
Andre, toes. Toes, not shins. Toes.

544
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:57,131
I need a new outfit.

545
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,767
Are you sure this is
the right store for me?

546
00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:06,868
I'm trying to make you cooler,
you see,

547
00:34:06,911 --> 00:34:09,675
not go to the stores that you
usually go to... the uncool ones.

548
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:12,512
I haven't been to a store
in quite a long time, frankly.

549
00:34:17,955 --> 00:34:20,515
- Hey.
- Hey.

550
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:22,185
Hey.

551
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:24,217
He needs to exchange his suit.

552
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:27,820
Six bucks.

553
00:34:27,865 --> 00:34:29,992
Six bucks?
This cost me four grand.

554
00:34:30,034 --> 00:34:33,060
I sold my first fabrication in this.
This is my lucky goddamn suit.

555
00:34:33,104 --> 00:34:35,538
I don't think it's lucky anymore,
do you?

556
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:38,235
Don't sell it then.
Use your parolee money. I don't care.

557
00:34:38,276 --> 00:34:41,439
I don't have any more, all right?
I had to buy stuff.

558
00:34:41,479 --> 00:34:42,776
What did you buy?

559
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:46,750
You know, taxis, donuts,
deodorant.

560
00:34:46,784 --> 00:34:49,582
I'll go up to seven bucks.

561
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,611
- Looks good.
- I feel like an asshole.

562
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:53,385
You are an asshole,
but you look better.

563
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:55,824
- I look like a lesbian.
- You look gender-neutral.

564
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:58,693
Gender-neutral? That wasn't exactly
the look I was going for.

565
00:34:58,729 --> 00:35:01,425
It's cool.
It's like urban DJ.

566
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:03,400
Right.

567
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:05,299
Lily!

568
00:35:06,337 --> 00:35:09,033
Lily!

569
00:35:09,073 --> 00:35:11,303
- Lily!
- Did you lose your dog, ma'am?

570
00:35:11,342 --> 00:35:14,140
No, it's my daughter.
I can't find my daughter.

571
00:35:14,178 --> 00:35:17,875
- Oh, is that her? Hey.
- Lily, Lily.

572
00:35:17,915 --> 00:35:20,213
Don't ever do that.

573
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:22,242
Don't ever run away from me
again like that.

574
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:24,880
You scared Mommy. Do you understand
what could happen to you?

575
00:35:24,922 --> 00:35:27,390
(game bleeping)

576
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:30,155
Oh yeah, saving the day.

577
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:56,679
Steven Leslie.

578
00:35:56,721 --> 00:35:59,212
Robert Axle.

579
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:01,418
How's the family?
How's Claire?

580
00:36:01,459 --> 00:36:04,428
Fine. How's my
$1.6 billion company?

581
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:09,729
It's 2.7 now.

582
00:36:09,767 --> 00:36:13,134
Oh, you feel good about that, huh?
Sucking off the Robert Axle teat?

583
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:15,969
Your name on the product... you take
the fall when it disfigures people.

584
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,497
My name was the product.

585
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:20,010
Face it, we could have put
birdshit in a box

586
00:36:20,044 --> 00:36:21,705
and we would have moved
three million units

587
00:36:21,746 --> 00:36:23,737
as long as it was
a Robert Axle fabrication.

588
00:36:23,781 --> 00:36:25,009
What do you want, Axle?

589
00:36:25,049 --> 00:36:26,744
Steve, we live in the world

590
00:36:26,784 --> 00:36:29,150
where parents are so paranoid
about losing their children

591
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:31,678
that they're willing to put a leash
on them just to keep track of them.

592
00:36:31,722 --> 00:36:34,885
Now imagine if that leash
were wireless.

593
00:36:34,926 --> 00:36:36,359
The kid doesn't feel like a dog;

594
00:36:36,394 --> 00:36:38,954
the parents know the instant
the kid wanders out of a certain range;

595
00:36:38,996 --> 00:36:41,726
they get a vibration on a receiver;
they know where their kids are.

596
00:36:41,766 --> 00:36:46,203
Wireless child leashes
already exist, Axle... not big sellers.

597
00:36:46,237 --> 00:36:47,534
- And you know why?
- Why?

598
00:36:47,572 --> 00:36:52,009
Because nobody's ever thought
to market them to kids.

599
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:55,376
Say we bury
the leash technology

600
00:36:55,413 --> 00:36:58,246
inside of a kid's watch,

601
00:36:58,282 --> 00:36:59,613
but not just any watch.

602
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:01,584
I mean, this is like the coolest,
the greatest,

603
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:03,746
the grooviest gadget watch
ever invented.

604
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:05,779
It's... are you ready for it?

605
00:37:05,823 --> 00:37:07,415
Watchdawg.

606
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:10,086
Right? It plays music,
video games,

607
00:37:10,127 --> 00:37:12,527
emails. It takes pictures.

608
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:15,896
Everything plays music and video games
and takes pictures these days.

609
00:37:15,933 --> 00:37:18,026
What, have you been living
under a rock?

610
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,435
Steve, you're missing the point.

611
00:37:20,471 --> 00:37:22,439
This is about bringing together

612
00:37:22,473 --> 00:37:24,634
a child's need to be entertained

613
00:37:24,675 --> 00:37:27,143
with a parent's need
to keep them safe.

614
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:32,178
All things are intertwined, Steve.

615
00:37:32,216 --> 00:37:34,047
And all we gotta do
is step out of the way

616
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:37,350
and let atoms and molecules
show us how easy it is...

617
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:41,484
Wait, did you just say
the atoms and the molecules?

618
00:37:43,794 --> 00:37:47,025
You know how hard it was for us
to distance ourselves from you?

619
00:37:48,065 --> 00:37:51,694
Do you know how hard it is for me
to distance myself from me?

620
00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:55,399
Axle, from my heart,
I would love to help you, but I can't.

621
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:59,170
Jesus Christ, Steve.
I gave you your first job.

622
00:38:01,512 --> 00:38:05,141
- Good luck.
- You're gonna regret this.

623
00:38:05,182 --> 00:38:07,173
This is Robert Axle.

624
00:38:07,218 --> 00:38:09,345
Can I speak to Mr. Johnson, please?

625
00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:11,378
- Woman: Edward?
- Yeah, Ed.

626
00:38:11,422 --> 00:38:13,982
- Who did you say was calling?
- Robert Axle.

627
00:38:14,025 --> 00:38:17,290
The Robert Axle?
The infomercial guy?

628
00:38:17,328 --> 00:38:19,296
Yes, that Robert Axle.

629
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:21,230
- (woman laughs)
- Well, listen...

630
00:38:21,265 --> 00:38:23,256
(hangs up)

631
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:26,060
Man: Mickey, is this you
joking around again?

632
00:38:26,103 --> 00:38:28,128
- No, look, the whole...
- (hangs up)

633
00:38:28,172 --> 00:38:31,505
Yeah. Yeah, formerly...
hello?

634
00:38:31,542 --> 00:38:33,635
Bob Agzel.

635
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:37,205
- Man: Robert Axle?
- Agzel.

636
00:38:43,788 --> 00:38:46,882
(phone ringing)

637
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,420
Hello.

638
00:38:50,461 --> 00:38:53,225
Woman: Yeah, hi. Somebody just
called me from this number.

639
00:38:53,264 --> 00:38:55,664
They left a message about a pitch,
but I didn't get a name.

640
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:59,067
Oh, sorry about that.
No my name is...

641
00:38:59,103 --> 00:39:01,628
- Troy Coangelo.
- Troy Coangelo.

642
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:03,663
Troy Coangelo.

643
00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:05,767
Okay, and how do you spell that?

644
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:07,937
T-R-O-Y.

645
00:39:07,978 --> 00:39:09,969
Yeah, no, I got that part.

646
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:16,544
Oh, C-O-A-N-G-L-O.

647
00:39:16,587 --> 00:39:19,818
- Really? No E after the G?
- Nope.

648
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:21,722
And you do have
a working prototype?

649
00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:23,920
Ha. I wouldn't be calling
if I didn't.

650
00:39:23,961 --> 00:39:26,293
Oh, now is really not a good time.

651
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:29,026
Matt leaves for Dubai
on Wednesday.

652
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,962
We're gonna have to get you in
on Tuesday. How's 9:00 AM?

653
00:39:33,003 --> 00:39:36,200
Uh, let me just look for a second.

654
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,901
Woman: Mr. Coanglo?

655
00:39:37,942 --> 00:39:39,671
Yeah, I can make Tuesday work.

656
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:42,042
Woman: Okay. All right, great.
We'll see you then.

657
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:44,309
Okay, thank you very much.

658
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:58,161
Excuse me.
I wonder if you could help me.

659
00:39:58,195 --> 00:39:59,992
I'm looking for Sam Bergman's
room, please.

660
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:02,521
You're new around here.

661
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:04,534
Yes, I guess you could say that.

662
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:06,661
- Well, let me show you.
- Okay, thank you.

663
00:40:06,704 --> 00:40:10,140
Now you can't have Sam's room,
'cause Sam ain't passed yet.

664
00:40:10,174 --> 00:40:11,334
I'm sorry?

665
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:14,469
But I can see why you'd want it,
because it's got a good view,

666
00:40:14,512 --> 00:40:16,742
it's close to everything, but...

667
00:40:16,781 --> 00:40:19,614
Yeah, I think you misunderstood.
I'm just here to visit Sam.

668
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:20,947
I'm not actually moving in.

669
00:40:20,985 --> 00:40:24,113
But Sam ain't passed yet,
so you can't have his room.

670
00:40:24,155 --> 00:40:27,488
Now this room here...
this will suit you just fine.

671
00:40:27,525 --> 00:40:29,686
As a matter of fact,
I tried to get this room,

672
00:40:29,727 --> 00:40:33,094
because across the hall here...
this is Miss Miller's room.

673
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:35,826
And ooh-ee,

674
00:40:35,866 --> 00:40:39,097
Miss Miller... she is all right.

675
00:40:39,136 --> 00:40:42,071
Great. Harold, hold that thought.
I'll be right back.

676
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:01,488
Not a bad place.

677
00:41:03,828 --> 00:41:04,988
It sucks.

678
00:41:05,029 --> 00:41:06,690
Yeah? Try prison.

679
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:10,928
Prison is avoidable.
Senility is not.

680
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:13,402
(chuckles)

681
00:41:13,437 --> 00:41:15,268
Well, what the hell do you want?

682
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:18,605
I can't just come by and visit
the best engineer I know?

683
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:21,839
I told you people would get tired
of doing crunches.

684
00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:23,574
You should have listened to me.

685
00:41:23,614 --> 00:41:25,775
You didn't tell me people would
get sick of doing crunches.

686
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:27,784
You told me we needed
more testing.

687
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:29,410
And you were right.

688
00:41:29,453 --> 00:41:33,082
Again I ask, what do you want?

689
00:41:34,792 --> 00:41:36,089
A prototype.

690
00:41:36,126 --> 00:41:38,720
I'm retired.

691
00:41:38,762 --> 00:41:40,957
This is a gadget watch for kids.

692
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:43,967
Combined with what?
A garden hose?

693
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:47,459
How about a catcher's mitt?

694
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:50,372
How about child leash technology?

695
00:41:50,407 --> 00:41:53,035
There are so many kids
getting lost out there these days, Sam.

696
00:41:53,077 --> 00:41:54,567
We gotta do something about it.

697
00:41:54,612 --> 00:41:57,103
What makes you think
that I will work with you again?

698
00:41:57,147 --> 00:42:00,412
'Cause you need this
as bad as I do.

699
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:08,984
Five grand, five days.

700
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:11,324
- Done.
- You do have the money?

701
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:13,796
No, but I'll get it.

702
00:42:13,831 --> 00:42:17,733
No money, no prototype.
I mean it, Axle.

703
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:24,330
This is a brilliant concept. I can't
believe someone else hasn't done it yet.

704
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:26,536
And it's not like you're asking
for a lot of money here.

705
00:42:26,577 --> 00:42:29,307
I mean, five grand's nothing
when it comes to prototypes.

706
00:42:29,346 --> 00:42:31,974
Neil, you cannot
possibly know

707
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:33,813
how relieved I am
to hear you tell me that.

708
00:42:33,851 --> 00:42:37,116
Can I interrupt you for a second?
Okay, you know how people

709
00:42:37,154 --> 00:42:39,315
always blow out the candles
on a birthday cake

710
00:42:39,356 --> 00:42:43,452
and then they expect everyone to want
to eat it with their germs all over it?

711
00:42:43,494 --> 00:42:46,361
Introducing the Neilster.

712
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:49,332
Okay?
I could have bronchitis

713
00:42:49,366 --> 00:42:51,391
and be blowing
on your birthday cake.

714
00:42:51,435 --> 00:42:52,766
May I?

715
00:42:52,803 --> 00:42:56,500
(blows air)

716
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:57,837
It's good, right?

717
00:42:57,875 --> 00:43:02,073
Showed my boss the business plan...
signed off on a deuce that afternoon.

718
00:43:02,112 --> 00:43:03,272
A deuce?

719
00:43:03,314 --> 00:43:05,043
Yeah, it's loan officer talk
for 20K.

720
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:07,050
You know what K means, right?

721
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:09,575
I don't have a business plan.

722
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:11,884
- You don't have a business plan?
- Shh.

723
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:15,983
My business plan is
the $1.6 billion empire I built.

724
00:43:17,728 --> 00:43:19,025
Don't write that down.

725
00:43:21,231 --> 00:43:24,098
Just give me one moment here.

726
00:43:24,134 --> 00:43:26,125
What are you d...?

727
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:29,662
Okay, anything else I should know
before I run this up the flagpole?

728
00:43:29,707 --> 00:43:31,766
No, that's it.

729
00:43:31,809 --> 00:43:34,209
Good. My boss hates surprises.

730
00:43:38,082 --> 00:43:40,676
I am also a convicted felon.

731
00:43:40,718 --> 00:43:41,776
I'm sorry?

732
00:43:41,819 --> 00:43:44,219
I'm a convicted felon.

733
00:43:44,254 --> 00:43:46,245
Oh.

734
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:49,316
I'm not sure if we give loans

735
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,692
to convicted felons.

736
00:43:55,666 --> 00:43:58,294
I've got a gut feeling
about you though.

737
00:43:58,335 --> 00:44:00,803
And my boss is big
on gut feelings.

738
00:44:02,873 --> 00:44:05,603
Neil, thank you.

739
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:07,907
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

740
00:44:07,945 --> 00:44:11,574
And this... it's a great idea.

741
00:44:11,615 --> 00:44:14,982
- Give me just a moment, okay?
- Okay.

742
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:22,758
Okay, we've got
a new customer... 5K.

743
00:44:22,793 --> 00:44:24,818
I've got a good feeling
about this one.

744
00:44:27,064 --> 00:44:29,089
This gentleman right over here.

745
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:51,753
Jerry!

746
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:55,890
Ranger Jerry!

747
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:00,687
Jerry!

748
00:45:04,601 --> 00:45:06,899
- Hey.
- Punks!

749
00:45:06,937 --> 00:45:09,337
Upsetting my fritillary butterflies.

750
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:11,398
That's an endangered species, Axle.

751
00:45:11,442 --> 00:45:13,034
(cocks gun)

752
00:45:13,077 --> 00:45:15,443
You'd better not come back!

753
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:18,378
- (gun clicks)
- Jesus!

754
00:45:18,415 --> 00:45:20,747
Shit, my fault.

755
00:45:20,784 --> 00:45:22,547
Well, I hate to bother you
while you're working,

756
00:45:22,586 --> 00:45:24,577
but I need to borrow five grand.

757
00:45:24,621 --> 00:45:27,181
Axle, you're my boy, man.

758
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:29,124
I'd hook you up just on principle.

759
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:32,458
But me and Lo... we're a little
strapped for cash at the moment.

760
00:45:32,496 --> 00:45:35,226
Strapped for cash?
That's impossible.

761
00:45:35,265 --> 00:45:37,495
How can you go through $362 million
in eight years?

762
00:45:37,534 --> 00:45:39,365
It's easier than you think, man...

763
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:43,203
charity, bidding wars on eBay, trips.

764
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:46,641
It costs 86 grand a day
just to rent your own submarine.

765
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:52,178
Tell me how much she blew
on this so-called music career of hers.

766
00:45:52,216 --> 00:45:56,118
Let's just say she made
a lot of videos,

767
00:45:56,153 --> 00:45:58,519
a couple
at Mount Rushmore.

768
00:45:58,555 --> 00:46:01,854
Oh man, I gotta go to this fundraiser
thing, man, before Lorraine kills me.

769
00:46:01,892 --> 00:46:04,690
You see? That's another reason
you're broke... too much philanthropy.

770
00:46:04,728 --> 00:46:06,252
What is it now?
Oh, let me guess...

771
00:46:06,296 --> 00:46:09,356
the Indigenous Giraffes'
Sperm Foundation

772
00:46:09,399 --> 00:46:12,630
for the Pigmies
Who Have Lung Cancer

773
00:46:12,669 --> 00:46:15,399
and Don't Have Mosquito Nets
Foundation?

774
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:17,600
It's Claire's event, Axle.

775
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:25,513
(quiet piano music playing)

776
00:46:25,549 --> 00:46:29,383
Claire: We teach them interview skills
and how to build a resume.

777
00:46:29,419 --> 00:46:33,014
The women are really using
the resources we provide for them

778
00:46:33,056 --> 00:46:36,514
to go out into the world
and find jobs on their own.

779
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,586
This is an amazing project.
You should be very proud.

780
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:42,258
Thank you.
Oh, this is my roommate Phoebe.

781
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:45,495
I'm a lesbian.

782
00:46:45,536 --> 00:46:49,632
Oh, isn't that wonderful for you?

783
00:46:49,673 --> 00:46:51,664
It is actually.

784
00:46:51,708 --> 00:46:53,903
Well, have you guys seen
the silent auction?

785
00:46:53,944 --> 00:46:56,105
No, I haven't seen it yet.
I would love to.

786
00:47:16,033 --> 00:47:18,467
Don't you take
one more step, Axle.

787
00:47:21,238 --> 00:47:23,172
You have to leave now.

788
00:47:23,207 --> 00:47:25,175
Hey, it's a fundraiser, Medusa.
I'm here to raise funds.

789
00:47:25,209 --> 00:47:28,474
(giggles) Medusa.
It's like Madonna, but it's...

790
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:29,809
Hi Axle.

791
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:32,475
- Hi.
- Somehow, someway

792
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:34,711
none of these people know
you're associated with Claire.

793
00:47:34,751 --> 00:47:36,981
Then it shouldn't be a problem
that I'm here.

794
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:38,885
You're a piece of work,
you know that?

795
00:47:38,922 --> 00:47:41,982
I'm a piece of work?
You're the one that blew $362 million.

796
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:45,358
At least I lost my half giving it
to my victims. What's your excuse?

797
00:47:45,395 --> 00:47:48,057
My excuse is that money was cursed.
It took me eight years

798
00:47:48,098 --> 00:47:50,032
and every fiber of my being
to get rid of it,

799
00:47:50,067 --> 00:47:52,001
and now that it's gone,
I'm so glad...

800
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:55,562
Hi Axle. I'd like you to meet my
parents... Howard and Penny Camp.

801
00:47:55,606 --> 00:47:57,733
- Hello.
- Howard: Hello.

802
00:47:57,774 --> 00:48:01,232
How nice that you and Lorraine
can put aside your differences

803
00:48:01,278 --> 00:48:03,542
to support Claire
on her special night.

804
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:06,208
Well, Claire has always
come first in our family.

805
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:09,219
- (Lorraine clears throat)
- Listen, Axle, I...

806
00:48:09,253 --> 00:48:11,585
I'll admit that when I found out

807
00:48:11,622 --> 00:48:14,682
that my daughter Donna was gonna be
living with a convicted felon,

808
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:18,217
that I was... I'm sorry...
rather uncomfortable.

809
00:48:18,262 --> 00:48:20,492
But then

810
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:23,192
we started going through
some of Donna's old stuff.

811
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:25,929
Getting ready to convert her bedroom
into a guest room.

812
00:48:25,969 --> 00:48:28,460
And they found my old
Light-O-Saurus.

813
00:48:28,505 --> 00:48:31,497
And when we heard
that you had designed that

814
00:48:31,541 --> 00:48:33,600
for Claire back in the day,

815
00:48:33,644 --> 00:48:36,204
well, we were damn near
moved to tears.

816
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:37,907
He is good.

817
00:48:37,948 --> 00:48:42,476
Isn't this wonderful... this event?
Just wonderful.

818
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:45,545
Penny Camp,

819
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:47,921
what is it about this event

820
00:48:47,958 --> 00:48:50,722
that's so wonderful?

821
00:48:52,329 --> 00:48:54,524
People helping people.

822
00:48:54,564 --> 00:48:56,464
Bingo. You said it.

823
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,627
That's it.
In a word... community.

824
00:48:58,669 --> 00:49:02,264
Culture and community.

825
00:49:02,306 --> 00:49:05,104
Ladies and gentlemen,
if all of us could do just that...

826
00:49:05,142 --> 00:49:08,669
come together
as a community, as a culture...

827
00:49:08,712 --> 00:49:10,976
I mean,
ask yourselves this question:

828
00:49:11,014 --> 00:49:14,211
How many women
has this center helped

829
00:49:14,251 --> 00:49:16,151
get off drugs just this year?

830
00:49:16,186 --> 00:49:18,882
- God, he thinks it's a drug center.
- Community, culture.

831
00:49:18,922 --> 00:49:20,389
Culture, community.

832
00:49:20,424 --> 00:49:21,914
Believe me,

833
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:24,757
when I started my company
I hadn't a pot to piss in.

834
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:26,786
Look at these women
on these walls,

835
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:30,493
putting things in their bodies
that just harm them.

836
00:49:30,534 --> 00:49:32,593
And this place helps that.

837
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:35,196
Well, all of you should
get out your checkbooks right now

838
00:49:35,238 --> 00:49:36,899
and write a big check
for my daughter.

839
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:39,204
There's no reason she should
have to do this for herself.

840
00:49:39,242 --> 00:49:41,176
We've all got to get on
this bandwagon.

841
00:49:41,211 --> 00:49:43,736
Let's make that wall of success
a world of success.

842
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:45,077
What do you say?

843
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:55,815
(crowd murmuring)

844
00:50:02,966 --> 00:50:04,228
Hi.

845
00:50:04,267 --> 00:50:06,132
What the hell was that?

846
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:09,002
Well, I don't know. You tell me.
Seems to be some big event

847
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:11,007
that everybody got invited to tonight
except me.

848
00:50:11,041 --> 00:50:13,305
That's exactly why
I didn't invite you... that speech.

849
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:15,208
What's the matter with my speech?
I was doing my bit.

850
00:50:15,245 --> 00:50:16,803
I had them eating
out of the palm of my hand.

851
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:19,213
It's a center for women's employment,
not a drug rehab.

852
00:50:19,249 --> 00:50:21,149
That's how blind you are.

853
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:23,311
Well, what difference does it make?
Drugs, employment...

854
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:25,321
it's all about helping p...
all right, never mind.

855
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:27,482
You don't have to worry about me
anymore, 'cause you know what?

856
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:29,685
I've got a whole new thing happening,
and come Tuesday...

857
00:50:29,726 --> 00:50:32,490
Let me guess...
the great Robert Axle will be back

858
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:34,895
in all his glory.

859
00:50:36,933 --> 00:50:39,333
God, it's like you want me
to stay like this...

860
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:41,735
homeless, without a job.

861
00:50:41,772 --> 00:50:45,139
Would it really be so bad
if I started to do well again

862
00:50:45,175 --> 00:50:47,166
after what I've been through?

863
00:51:06,763 --> 00:51:08,993
(door opens)

864
00:51:29,886 --> 00:51:33,515
My parents thought
you were awesome.

865
00:51:33,557 --> 00:51:36,151
And that speech was amazing.

866
00:51:40,197 --> 00:51:42,188
Don't give up, Axle.

867
00:51:42,232 --> 00:51:44,257
You guys will figure it out.

868
00:52:26,176 --> 00:52:28,144
(grunts)

869
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:31,671
Okay, item one...

870
00:52:31,715 --> 00:52:34,775
one-of-a-kind Light-O-Saurus

871
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:37,252
signed by Robert Axle,

872
00:52:37,287 --> 00:52:41,189
as seen in the original infomercial,

873
00:52:41,224 --> 00:52:44,387
2500 bucks...

874
00:52:44,427 --> 00:52:46,418
(hisses)

875
00:52:48,532 --> 00:52:50,523
(coughing)

876
00:53:24,167 --> 00:53:26,965
Daddy, you did it.
You sold it.

877
00:53:27,003 --> 00:53:29,836
No no, baby, we did it.

878
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:32,341
We sold it.

879
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:34,002
And you know why?

880
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:38,639
You brought my picture with you?

881
00:53:38,682 --> 00:53:40,673
Yes, I did.

882
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:44,717
Oh goodness. Oh goodness.

883
00:53:44,754 --> 00:53:46,449
Oh my goodness,
what happened?

884
00:53:46,489 --> 00:53:49,049
It's unbelievable
how cute you are.

885
00:53:49,092 --> 00:53:51,083
Oh, you think she's giggling?

886
00:53:51,127 --> 00:53:53,652
You're gonna like what I have
to give you even better.

887
00:53:56,666 --> 00:53:59,226
Oh.

888
00:54:18,121 --> 00:54:20,487
You should have grabbed yourself
a raincoat, Axle.

889
00:54:20,523 --> 00:54:22,821
Oh thanks.
I would have never thought of that.

890
00:54:22,859 --> 00:54:24,417
How are things going
with your daughter?

891
00:54:24,461 --> 00:54:26,224
Uh, good.

892
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:29,426
Yeah? So she's getting past
her abandonment issues?

893
00:54:29,466 --> 00:54:32,526
I mean, most kids never really forgive
their parents for going away to prison.

894
00:54:32,569 --> 00:54:35,902
I'm sorry, who are you?

895
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:39,272
Part parole officer, part uncle,
part therapist.

896
00:54:39,309 --> 00:54:42,972
Yeah, well, why don't we just stick
to the part parole officer part?

897
00:54:43,013 --> 00:54:47,040
Okay, how are things going
at Family Mart?

898
00:54:47,083 --> 00:54:49,847
You know, what can I say?
Family Mart is Family Mart.

899
00:54:49,886 --> 00:54:52,047
Troy told me
he had to let you go.

900
00:54:53,189 --> 00:54:56,852
You know, a big part of this program
is keeping a steady job, Axle.

901
00:54:56,893 --> 00:55:00,329
67% of felons
wind up going back to prison...

902
00:55:00,363 --> 00:55:04,129
Whoa whoa whoa, you just
told me last week it was 62%.

903
00:55:04,167 --> 00:55:06,897
Did I?
Well, there's a new report.

904
00:55:06,936 --> 00:55:09,268
The numbers have gone up.

905
00:55:10,774 --> 00:55:11,975
Oh great.

906
00:55:20,617 --> 00:55:22,642
(sighs)

907
00:55:32,696 --> 00:55:35,790
- Phoebe. Phoebe!
- What?

908
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:38,164
- Phoebe!
- What?

909
00:55:38,201 --> 00:55:39,828
Where's Rock Band?

910
00:55:41,705 --> 00:55:45,436
Son of a bitch. Ooh.

911
00:55:47,143 --> 00:55:48,371
What happened?

912
00:55:48,411 --> 00:55:50,402
My ex...

913
00:55:50,447 --> 00:55:52,438
that bitch stole my shit!

914
00:55:52,482 --> 00:55:54,950
Wow, things are nasty
when chicks break up.

915
00:55:54,984 --> 00:55:56,975
Oh, it's gonna get really nasty!

916
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:59,147
Oh shit.

917
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:00,349
- Hi.
- Hi.

918
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:03,917
- I'm here to make a deposit.
- Okay.

919
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:06,190
Oh, you're with the center.

920
00:56:06,229 --> 00:56:09,198
I love that. I was just
telling my sister all about it,

921
00:56:09,232 --> 00:56:11,723
- how they help the women...
- That's right.

922
00:56:11,768 --> 00:56:13,998
...with jobs and everything.
That's great.

923
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:16,028
Oh.

924
00:56:16,072 --> 00:56:19,200
Do you know you've bounced
a couple of checks this week?

925
00:56:22,479 --> 00:56:26,506
Hey, have you applied
for any grants?

926
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:29,518
- (phone ringing)
- Yes, grants are really hard...

927
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:31,645
- sorry, hold on one second.
- Well, maybe...

928
00:56:31,688 --> 00:56:34,350
- One second, sorry. Donna.
- Claire, I have to tell...

929
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:36,325
- I'll call you back, okay?
- No no no no.

930
00:56:36,359 --> 00:56:39,590
- Robert: Just don't do anything stupid.
- I'm not gonna do anything stupid.

931
00:56:39,629 --> 00:56:41,654
I'm just gonna march up to the door
and I'm gonna be like,

932
00:56:41,698 --> 00:56:43,666
(shouts) "Give me back
my Rock Band, bitch!"

933
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:45,497
- (honks horn)
- (phone ringing)

934
00:56:45,535 --> 00:56:47,526
- Donna, I'm busy.
- Wait, Phoebe...

935
00:56:51,207 --> 00:56:55,143
- What up, Phoebe?
- Bitch, give me back my Rock Band.

936
00:56:55,178 --> 00:56:57,078
Whoa, what's with
the Louisville Slugger?

937
00:56:57,113 --> 00:56:58,978
What, did you join the all-dyke
softball league?

938
00:56:59,015 --> 00:57:01,848
- Hey!
- Give me back my Rock Band.

939
00:57:01,885 --> 00:57:04,615
Then give me back the $4200
that I spent on your fake titties!

940
00:57:04,654 --> 00:57:08,852
Stop talking shit about my tits.
They're great, asshole.

941
00:57:08,892 --> 00:57:13,261
You want your game?
You want your game?

942
00:57:13,296 --> 00:57:16,231
Your ex is a guy?
I thought you were a lesbian.

943
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:17,358
I am.

944
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,391
Here's your game.
Here you go.

945
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:22,166
Don't break it.

946
00:57:22,205 --> 00:57:24,196
(imitates guitar)

947
00:57:25,809 --> 00:57:28,903
How about some drums, huh?
You want some drums?

948
00:57:28,945 --> 00:57:31,072
Yeah? Yeah?

949
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:33,082
(screams)

950
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:35,107
Who the hell is he?

951
00:57:35,151 --> 00:57:37,745
You're worthless, Phoebe.
You are worthless.

952
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:40,221
You're never gonna get a man like me.
What are you gonna settle for?

953
00:57:40,256 --> 00:57:43,350
You don't even know who you are.
You're nobody without me.

954
00:57:43,393 --> 00:57:45,884
- (groaning)
- Come on, let's go.

955
00:57:45,929 --> 00:57:47,920
Drive. Drive.

956
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:49,625
(man screams)

957
00:57:49,666 --> 00:57:52,260
Bye.

958
00:57:58,675 --> 00:58:01,143
Oh, look, forget about him.
He's an idiot.

959
00:58:01,177 --> 00:58:03,042
I had to shut him down.
Somebody had to stop him.

960
00:58:03,079 --> 00:58:04,706
He's an idiot.
And he's a liar too.

961
00:58:04,747 --> 00:58:07,181
'Cause anybody who looks at him
can tell he's still in love with you.

962
00:58:07,217 --> 00:58:10,186
He thinks you're more beautiful now,
more attractive, more intelligent.

963
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:13,986
I mean, look at you. You're funny.
You've got this great style about you.

964
00:58:14,023 --> 00:58:17,151
And he's a total idiot for thinking...
you know what? He's probably feeling

965
00:58:17,193 --> 00:58:20,060
like a total fool... the fact that
he used to have you and now...

966
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:43,011
(TV playing)

967
00:58:57,033 --> 00:58:59,024
How was your day, Claire?

968
00:58:59,068 --> 00:59:01,559
Horrible.
I'm so over everyone.

969
00:59:01,604 --> 00:59:04,402
I hate people.

970
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:06,635
You know what?
Everywhere I go

971
00:59:06,676 --> 00:59:08,473
people go on and on
about the center,

972
00:59:08,511 --> 00:59:11,036
and when push comes to shove,
nobody wants to pony up.

973
00:59:13,783 --> 00:59:16,047
- What's wrong with you?
- I didn't say anything.

974
00:59:16,085 --> 00:59:17,780
- I know.
- What am I supposed to say?

975
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:20,789
- It's weird. You're acting weird.
- I'm not acting weird. I'm acting...

976
00:59:20,823 --> 00:59:23,155
Tonight I'm having a date
with my friend Jack,

977
00:59:23,192 --> 00:59:24,784
if anybody wants to join me.

978
00:59:24,827 --> 00:59:27,455
Donna, where are you going?

979
00:59:27,497 --> 00:59:29,692
I'm going to your mom's house.

980
00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:30,960
You're going to my mom's?

981
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,059
Yeah, well, she picked up
my phone calls.

982
00:59:33,102 --> 00:59:35,002
Claire: Wait,
did I miss something?

983
00:59:35,038 --> 00:59:38,565
My parents are getting divorced,
but things happen.

984
00:59:38,608 --> 00:59:41,406
Divorced? Since when?

985
00:59:41,444 --> 00:59:46,074
Since my father started cheating
on my mom with her friend.

986
00:59:46,115 --> 00:59:48,640
- My God.
- See you.

987
00:59:48,685 --> 00:59:50,710
Claire: Donna, if you're going
to my mom's house,

988
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:53,347
- we're all going to my mom's house.
- We're all going?

989
00:59:53,389 --> 00:59:55,619
Oh, like you have
something better to do?

990
00:59:55,658 --> 00:59:58,058
I, on the other hand...
I have a date with a woman.

991
00:59:58,094 --> 00:59:59,959
She's a lesbian.

992
00:59:59,996 --> 01:00:01,520
Ugh.

993
01:00:01,564 --> 01:00:04,863
We're gonna have hot lesbo sex
all night long.

994
01:00:05,868 --> 01:00:07,859
# We're as happy as can be #

995
01:00:07,904 --> 01:00:09,895
# Oh oh oh oh #

996
01:00:09,939 --> 01:00:11,770
# Let's have a big parade #

997
01:00:11,808 --> 01:00:13,799
# And we'll make history... #

998
01:00:13,843 --> 01:00:15,834
Would you rather lick
a public toilet seat

999
01:00:15,878 --> 01:00:18,244
or chew gum from the floor
of the New York City subway?

1000
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:20,613
Gum. You know what?
No matter how disgusting it is,

1001
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:22,948
- it's better than a toilet.
- Lorraine: By the way,

1002
01:00:22,986 --> 01:00:24,783
how were the toilets
in prison, Axle?

1003
01:00:24,821 --> 01:00:27,221
Not very good,
kind of like your last album.

1004
01:00:27,256 --> 01:00:29,247
Okay,

1005
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:32,728
you see some unsightly Porta Potties
in my line of work, okay?

1006
01:00:32,762 --> 01:00:35,390
So I would chew that subway floor gum
all day, every day.

1007
01:00:35,431 --> 01:00:37,422
- (door opens and closes)
- How do you call this a game?

1008
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:40,630
Monopoly, Scrabble... those are games.
This... this is disgusting.

1009
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:42,661
- Phoebe: Hey.
- Claire: Hey.

1010
01:00:42,705 --> 01:00:44,696
- This is my friend Steak.
- Jerry: Hi.

1011
01:00:44,741 --> 01:00:48,074
- What's up?
- Robert: Steak, a chicken wing?

1012
01:00:48,111 --> 01:00:50,136
Nah, dude, I'm a vegetarian.

1013
01:00:50,179 --> 01:00:52,579
Really? How is that
gonna work out

1014
01:00:52,615 --> 01:00:54,981
since Phoebe likes your meat?

1015
01:00:55,018 --> 01:00:58,419
There's other things I like to eat
besides meat.

1016
01:00:58,454 --> 01:01:00,479
Lorraine:
I have one:

1017
01:01:00,523 --> 01:01:04,459
Would you rather spend
30 years

1018
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:06,519
happily married
to the love of your life

1019
01:01:06,562 --> 01:01:09,190
only to find out that he's been
cheating on you the whole time,

1020
01:01:09,232 --> 01:01:13,168
or spend 20 years taking care
of your deadbeat husband

1021
01:01:13,202 --> 01:01:15,193
who finally hits the big time

1022
01:01:15,238 --> 01:01:17,433
only to emotionally abandon
you and your daughter?

1023
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:23,442
I'll talk to her.

1024
01:01:24,847 --> 01:01:26,508
- Phoebe: Awkward.
- Steak: All right.

1025
01:01:26,549 --> 01:01:28,039
I thought this was
supposed to be a party.

1026
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:41,660
How could he do this to me?

1027
01:01:43,266 --> 01:01:45,734
Donna, I think in the moment
he wasn't doing it to anybody.

1028
01:01:45,768 --> 01:01:48,100
I think he was doing it
for himself.

1029
01:01:49,772 --> 01:01:52,673
I don't care.
When you decide to start a family,

1030
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:54,904
you make a commitment to them.

1031
01:01:54,944 --> 01:01:58,209
You don't turn your back
on the people who love you.

1032
01:02:01,184 --> 01:02:04,676
Fathers are human too.

1033
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:07,189
You know, you put
a piece of cake in front of us,

1034
01:02:07,223 --> 01:02:10,056
and that's all we can see.
Family, children... what?

1035
01:02:10,093 --> 01:02:12,755
No, we forget everything.
We get tunnel vision.

1036
01:02:12,795 --> 01:02:15,525
But you never cheated
on Lorraine.

1037
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:18,591
No, I didn't.

1038
01:02:18,634 --> 01:02:20,693
I left her for my job.

1039
01:02:23,139 --> 01:02:25,505
I'm just so angry at him.

1040
01:02:29,245 --> 01:02:31,611
Yeah, there's a lot of anger
in the air.

1041
01:02:35,685 --> 01:02:38,017
Think it does any good?

1042
01:03:14,891 --> 01:03:18,554
Phoebe, you know,
are you and my dad friends

1043
01:03:18,594 --> 01:03:21,256
or what's... what's the deal?

1044
01:03:21,297 --> 01:03:24,164
No. I mean, he helped me get
my guitar back from Eddie...

1045
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:27,499
you know, my game...
and that's it.

1046
01:03:27,537 --> 01:03:29,562
Wait, he met Eddie?

1047
01:03:29,605 --> 01:03:32,597
Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't call it
a formal "Hi, how are you doing?"

1048
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:34,940
But he did crack Eddie
in the nads for me

1049
01:03:34,977 --> 01:03:36,968
from behind, like mm!

1050
01:03:37,013 --> 01:03:39,709
You know, I think your dad's
pretty great, Claire.

1051
01:03:41,684 --> 01:03:44,175
What makes him so great?

1052
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:48,088
He just made me realize
that my father isn't perfect

1053
01:03:48,124 --> 01:03:50,149
and I need to accept that.

1054
01:03:54,263 --> 01:03:57,892
Young Claire: No, Daddy, don't leave.
I'm afraid of the dark.

1055
01:03:57,934 --> 01:04:00,494
Robert:
Okay, honey. Okay.

1056
01:04:00,536 --> 01:04:02,970
I'll stay for just a bit, okay?

1057
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:06,970
- How's that?
- (Claire coughs)

1058
01:04:07,009 --> 01:04:09,170
Shh, it's okay.

1059
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:12,647
(whispering)
You can watch the steam.

1060
01:04:16,452 --> 01:04:18,716
Look at that.

1061
01:04:18,754 --> 01:04:21,450
We can make animals.

1062
01:04:21,490 --> 01:04:23,481
Shh, it's okay.

1063
01:04:23,526 --> 01:04:25,517
(mimics roaring)

1064
01:04:25,561 --> 01:04:27,586
(Claire giggles)

1065
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:33,466
- (mimics roar)
- (squeals, giggles)

1066
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:45,370
Does my heart good,
makes me feel young, you know?

1067
01:04:45,414 --> 01:04:47,405
I tell you, my mind's sharp.

1068
01:04:47,450 --> 01:04:49,782
As a matter of fact, I don't know

1069
01:04:49,819 --> 01:04:52,720
if they could really run this place
around here if it weren't for me.

1070
01:04:52,755 --> 01:04:54,746
Hello, Sam.

1071
01:04:54,790 --> 01:04:56,280
You brought my check, right?

1072
01:04:56,325 --> 01:04:57,849
Of course I did.

1073
01:04:57,894 --> 01:05:00,886
I had to go into my own pocket
on this thing.

1074
01:05:00,930 --> 01:05:04,331
You won't believe
how many watches,

1075
01:05:04,367 --> 01:05:07,598
MP3 players and video games
I tore apart

1076
01:05:07,637 --> 01:05:09,867
before I figured this sucker out,

1077
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:12,534
not to mention carving
the faceplate.

1078
01:05:12,575 --> 01:05:14,566
I cut that son of a bitch

1079
01:05:14,610 --> 01:05:16,976
out of medium-density foam.

1080
01:05:17,013 --> 01:05:20,039
Well, you know, I don't have
any more money. $5000 is all I have.

1081
01:05:20,082 --> 01:05:22,642
Don't worry about it.
It was my pleasure.

1082
01:05:22,685 --> 01:05:24,846
I haven't felt this useful
in years.

1083
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:28,550
There it is.

1084
01:05:28,591 --> 01:05:31,617
Now the speaker is in the ear.

1085
01:05:31,661 --> 01:05:34,255
The camera is in the nose.

1086
01:05:34,297 --> 01:05:36,288
The gaming wheel
goes in the wristband

1087
01:05:36,332 --> 01:05:38,323
for optimal gaming control.

1088
01:05:38,367 --> 01:05:41,165
(watch bleeping)

1089
01:05:41,203 --> 01:05:44,229
Oh, Sam, this is awesome.

1090
01:05:44,273 --> 01:05:45,934
(Sam laughs)

1091
01:05:45,975 --> 01:05:48,569
- And what is that?
- That's a built-in compass.

1092
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:51,842
- Do kids still use compasses?
- They did in my day.

1093
01:05:51,881 --> 01:05:54,213
I just thought
with the wireless child leash

1094
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:56,650
we wouldn't need a compass.

1095
01:05:56,686 --> 01:05:59,154
A wireless child leash?

1096
01:05:59,188 --> 01:06:01,486
That's a good idea.

1097
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:06,251
The kid wanders off...

1098
01:06:06,295 --> 01:06:09,230
the parent feels a buzz
or something, huh?

1099
01:06:09,265 --> 01:06:10,994
You're kidding, right?

1100
01:06:11,033 --> 01:06:13,593
No, I'm not kidding.
That's a great idea.

1101
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:15,126
Sam.

1102
01:06:15,171 --> 01:06:17,571
I did good, right?

1103
01:06:19,141 --> 01:06:21,132
I did good.

1104
01:06:23,245 --> 01:06:25,338
Sam, you did great.

1105
01:06:25,381 --> 01:06:27,281
(laughs)

1106
01:06:31,687 --> 01:06:33,678
(groaning)

1107
01:06:46,802 --> 01:06:49,134
How are you holding up, Troy?

1108
01:06:49,171 --> 01:06:52,470
I have four titanium rods
in my tibia.

1109
01:06:52,508 --> 01:06:54,032
How do you think?

1110
01:06:55,077 --> 01:06:59,173
I'm sitting on another
great idea, Troy.

1111
01:06:59,215 --> 01:07:01,240
Congratulations.

1112
01:07:01,283 --> 01:07:03,308
Yeah, but I can't do it alone
this time.

1113
01:07:03,352 --> 01:07:04,717
I need a partner.

1114
01:07:07,790 --> 01:07:10,315
I make $32,700 a year.

1115
01:07:10,359 --> 01:07:13,055
I drive a Toyota Scion loaded.

1116
01:07:13,095 --> 01:07:14,824
You're barking up
the wrong tree, Axle.

1117
01:07:14,864 --> 01:07:17,526
I just need you to come with me
to one meeting.

1118
01:07:19,168 --> 01:07:20,999
- When?
- Tomorrow morning?

1119
01:07:21,037 --> 01:07:23,403
Oh, tomorrow morning?
Thanks for the notice.

1120
01:07:23,439 --> 01:07:25,031
Look, I was gonna go
on my own,

1121
01:07:25,074 --> 01:07:27,804
but now that the prototype doesn't work,
it makes no sense for me to go...

1122
01:07:27,843 --> 01:07:30,676
What's the point of the prototype
if it doesn't work?

1123
01:07:30,713 --> 01:07:33,147
Troy, no one is going to
buy a product

1124
01:07:33,182 --> 01:07:36,208
from a guy who cuts
people's fingers off.

1125
01:07:36,252 --> 01:07:40,848
But Troy Coangelo...
that's a different story.

1126
01:07:45,194 --> 01:07:46,525
No can do.

1127
01:07:46,562 --> 01:07:48,826
Come on, just help me
on this one, please.

1128
01:07:48,864 --> 01:07:51,389
I'm on from 7:00 to 7:00 tomorrow.

1129
01:07:51,434 --> 01:07:53,800
What difference does that make?
So Family Mart goes without

1130
01:07:53,836 --> 01:07:56,634
an assistant GM for a couple of hours.
What's the worst that can happen?

1131
01:07:56,672 --> 01:07:58,230
- A lot.
- Oh, come on.

1132
01:07:58,274 --> 01:07:59,866
- A lot can happen.
- Come on.

1133
01:07:59,909 --> 01:08:03,345
If you don't let go of this obsession
you have with Family Mart, Troy,

1134
01:08:03,379 --> 01:08:05,540
no one is gonna ever
take you seriously.

1135
01:08:05,581 --> 01:08:07,515
Hmm.

1136
01:08:07,550 --> 01:08:10,417
Haven't you ruined
enough people's lives?

1137
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:19,087
(sewing machine whirring)

1138
01:08:34,009 --> 01:08:36,034
Hey.

1139
01:08:37,079 --> 01:08:39,513
Hi.

1140
01:08:39,548 --> 01:08:44,247
It might be a little snug,
but I think we can make it work.

1141
01:08:47,389 --> 01:08:49,380
That's for me?

1142
01:08:49,425 --> 01:08:51,450
Here, try it on.

1143
01:08:58,367 --> 01:09:00,392
Let me see.

1144
01:09:03,272 --> 01:09:05,934
Yeah, it's a little snug.
Let me fix it.

1145
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:11,606
Is this like the pink coat
or you really want me to...?

1146
01:09:11,647 --> 01:09:14,047
I want you to look great.

1147
01:09:20,055 --> 01:09:22,751
Okay, let me finish it.

1148
01:09:36,505 --> 01:09:38,530
Why are you doing this?

1149
01:09:41,210 --> 01:09:44,111
I was the one
that believed in you,

1150
01:09:44,146 --> 01:09:46,876
not Mom.

1151
01:09:46,916 --> 01:09:49,248
It was me.

1152
01:09:52,721 --> 01:09:55,155
And I still believe in you.

1153
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:05,099
Um, I'm not really a hugger.

1154
01:10:06,101 --> 01:10:08,092
Okay.

1155
01:10:14,510 --> 01:10:16,535
(tires screech)

1156
01:10:22,284 --> 01:10:23,876
Jesus, Troy.

1157
01:10:25,187 --> 01:10:27,178
I blew my knee out
on their nickel.

1158
01:10:29,592 --> 01:10:31,583
(groaning)

1159
01:10:34,396 --> 01:10:37,923
Not a card,
not a "Hey, Troy, how's your leg?"

1160
01:10:37,967 --> 01:10:40,993
I've been assistant GM for three years
and you know what?

1161
01:10:41,036 --> 01:10:43,004
There's no GM.
I'm the guy.

1162
01:10:43,038 --> 01:10:45,233
They just don't want to give me
the title and have to shell out

1163
01:10:45,274 --> 01:10:47,367
an extra $1631 a year.

1164
01:10:47,409 --> 01:10:49,468
Where are you going
with this, Troy?

1165
01:10:49,511 --> 01:10:51,035
- Shame on you.
- Shame on me?

1166
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:52,945
Not you... Family Mart.

1167
01:10:52,982 --> 01:10:55,143
I'm confused.
Are you gonna help me out or not?

1168
01:10:55,184 --> 01:10:57,550
Oh, I'm gonna help you,
but it's not for the money,

1169
01:10:57,586 --> 01:10:59,781
it's not for the ladies
and it's not for the bling.

1170
01:10:59,822 --> 01:11:01,346
This is for principle.

1171
01:11:01,390 --> 01:11:03,654
How many painkillers
have you had?

1172
01:11:03,692 --> 01:11:05,523
One.

1173
01:11:05,561 --> 01:11:08,621
Well, I may have had
an extra Xanax or two.

1174
01:11:08,664 --> 01:11:12,828
I just get really nervous in meetings,
especially big ones.

1175
01:11:12,868 --> 01:11:15,837
Okay, I'm gonna put my bike in the back
and I'll drive, okay?

1176
01:11:30,786 --> 01:11:32,845
- Receptionist: Can I help you?
- Troy.

1177
01:11:32,888 --> 01:11:34,879
Hmm?

1178
01:11:34,923 --> 01:11:37,619
- Hi. We're here to meet Mike James.
- Matt James.

1179
01:11:37,660 --> 01:11:39,423
Matt James.

1180
01:11:39,461 --> 01:11:41,429
Aren't you Robert Axle?

1181
01:11:41,463 --> 01:11:43,124
This is my partner
Troy Coangelo.

1182
01:11:43,165 --> 01:11:45,497
I think you spoke to him on the phone
and set up the appointment.

1183
01:11:45,534 --> 01:11:47,399
I sure did.
I made an appointment with Troy.

1184
01:11:47,436 --> 01:11:49,563
I did not make an appointment
with Robert Axle.

1185
01:11:49,605 --> 01:11:51,573
We're partners.
What difference does that make?

1186
01:11:51,607 --> 01:11:53,871
The difference is that I had
no idea that you were coming.

1187
01:11:53,909 --> 01:11:56,605
I'm sorry,
is there some problem?

1188
01:11:56,645 --> 01:11:59,808
Robert Axle. Wow.

1189
01:12:01,283 --> 01:12:02,944
Come on in.

1190
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:05,146
- It's good to meet you guys.
- Great to meet you, Matt.

1191
01:12:05,187 --> 01:12:08,850
Troy Coangelo. Where did you get that
receptionist? She's really on the ball.

1192
01:12:08,891 --> 01:12:10,984
Oh yeah, Sheila?
She's amazing.

1193
01:12:11,026 --> 01:12:13,290
Yeah, you don't want your receptionist
being too hot...

1194
01:12:13,329 --> 01:12:15,297
makes things complicated.

1195
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:16,525
She's my wife.

1196
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:21,659
Hey, Sheila, would you be a doll
and get me a diet soda?

1197
01:12:21,704 --> 01:12:24,332
Yeah, I'll get right on that.

1198
01:12:27,576 --> 01:12:31,376
Ta-dah!
Presenting the Watchdawg.

1199
01:12:31,413 --> 01:12:33,074
Wow, that is awesome.

1200
01:12:33,115 --> 01:12:35,106
This thing plays MP3s,

1201
01:12:35,150 --> 01:12:37,311
music videos,
also takes photographs,

1202
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:39,344
but here's the most unique
thing about it...

1203
01:12:39,388 --> 01:12:41,049
It's also a wireless child leash.

1204
01:12:41,090 --> 01:12:44,548
- Does the prototype work?
- Does a bear shit in the woods, Sheila?

1205
01:12:44,593 --> 01:12:46,652
Send it a test to

1206
01:12:46,695 --> 01:12:49,892
watchtest@watchdog.org.

1207
01:12:49,932 --> 01:12:51,297
Let him hear the music.

1208
01:12:51,333 --> 01:12:54,268
Actually I think I might have
forgotten to load the music, Troy.

1209
01:12:54,303 --> 01:12:55,827
Email just bounced back.

1210
01:12:55,871 --> 01:12:59,500
We're not gonna lie to you,
the prototype is a little shaky.

1211
01:12:59,541 --> 01:13:01,771
Look, I'm not gonna say
that this is in perfect shape,

1212
01:13:01,810 --> 01:13:05,371
but this can be improved upon.
It is a great idea and I...

1213
01:13:05,414 --> 01:13:08,747
I don't know how to tell you this,
but honesty is the best policy here.

1214
01:13:08,784 --> 01:13:10,684
I met with Steven Leslie
two days ago.

1215
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:13,153
He pitched something
practically identical to that.

1216
01:13:13,188 --> 01:13:15,520
He's coming out with it.
It's called Watch Pal...

1217
01:13:15,557 --> 01:13:18,583
fast-tracking it,
wants it in play for the holiday season,

1218
01:13:18,627 --> 01:13:20,117
wants us to co-finance.

1219
01:13:20,162 --> 01:13:21,686
I met him a few days
before you did.

1220
01:13:21,730 --> 01:13:23,254
I pitched him this
and he turned it down.

1221
01:13:23,298 --> 01:13:25,391
I'm sorry to hear that.

1222
01:13:30,706 --> 01:13:33,869
You know why Family Mart
is the fourth-largest

1223
01:13:33,909 --> 01:13:36,935
discount consumer products
retailer in the nation?

1224
01:13:36,979 --> 01:13:38,640
No, I do not.

1225
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:41,706
Because it's not Target
and it's not Kmart

1226
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:44,184
and it sure as hell
not Walmart.

1227
01:13:44,219 --> 01:13:46,653
It's Family Mart...

1228
01:13:46,688 --> 01:13:48,485
the copycat,

1229
01:13:48,524 --> 01:13:52,187
the poser, the wannabe.

1230
01:13:52,227 --> 01:13:54,286
So if you want to invest

1231
01:13:54,329 --> 01:13:56,388
in the Family Mart version
of Watchdawg,

1232
01:13:56,432 --> 01:13:59,993
be my freakin' guest.

1233
01:14:09,077 --> 01:14:11,807
Oh, in case anybody
was wondering

1234
01:14:11,847 --> 01:14:13,906
who might have gotten
a six-figure advance

1235
01:14:13,949 --> 01:14:17,112
for the invention of a brand-new
groundbreaking fabrication,

1236
01:14:17,152 --> 01:14:19,518
that would be me... Robert Axle.

1237
01:14:19,555 --> 01:14:21,716
Yes, the same Robert Axle

1238
01:14:21,757 --> 01:14:24,920
who went to prison for eight years,
but now...

1239
01:14:26,328 --> 01:14:28,956
did I mention
the six-figure advance?

1240
01:14:28,997 --> 01:14:32,660
Anyway, I'm back.
Things are looking better than ever.

1241
01:14:32,701 --> 01:14:34,635
Of course I'm gonna have to share
some of that money

1242
01:14:34,670 --> 01:14:36,535
with my new partner
Troy Coangelo.

1243
01:14:36,572 --> 01:14:39,507
Somebody stole
Donna's identity.

1244
01:14:39,541 --> 01:14:43,375
Yeah, and then they racked up
a credit card bill for $5000.

1245
01:14:43,412 --> 01:14:46,540
Yeah, and then had the card sent to
a mailbox place right around the corner.

1246
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:54,550
Look, girls,

1247
01:14:54,590 --> 01:14:56,854
this is not a problem,
all right?

1248
01:14:56,892 --> 01:15:01,352
I've got a check in my pocket
for $125,000.

1249
01:15:01,396 --> 01:15:05,093
Let's not let a $5000 check
get us upset, all right?

1250
01:15:05,133 --> 01:15:08,762
I'm gonna pay off that credit card
before the first bill comes in.

1251
01:15:08,804 --> 01:15:12,001
You are a liar and you are a fake
and you are a phony.

1252
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:14,702
I was rooting for you
this whole time

1253
01:15:14,743 --> 01:15:16,301
and you steal from me?

1254
01:15:16,345 --> 01:15:18,575
No, I didn't steal from you.
I borrowed from you.

1255
01:15:18,614 --> 01:15:21,344
Claire, don't let them do this,
all right? Listen to me. Trust me.

1256
01:15:21,383 --> 01:15:22,850
I did trust you.

1257
01:15:22,885 --> 01:15:25,752
Look, baby, you want to fund
your center?

1258
01:15:25,787 --> 01:15:29,086
Give me six months. We'll have
enough money to fund 10 centers.

1259
01:15:29,124 --> 01:15:30,989
There's no we.
There's no we.

1260
01:15:31,026 --> 01:15:33,517
It's only you.
It's always been only you.

1261
01:15:35,731 --> 01:15:39,394
I give you five minutes
to get the hell out of here

1262
01:15:39,434 --> 01:15:41,459
or I'm calling the police.

1263
01:15:53,048 --> 01:15:55,141
# Speak to me #

1264
01:15:55,183 --> 01:15:59,483
# I swear I'm listening #

1265
01:16:02,558 --> 01:16:05,288
# Show me all the things #

1266
01:16:05,327 --> 01:16:08,091
# I'm missing #

1267
01:16:11,533 --> 01:16:13,967
# And let me kindly #

1268
01:16:14,002 --> 01:16:16,994
# Step aside #

1269
01:16:17,039 --> 01:16:20,668
# Let these heavenly objects collide #

1270
01:16:20,709 --> 01:16:22,700
# Speak to me #

1271
01:16:22,744 --> 01:16:25,770
# I'm finally listening #

1272
01:16:27,683 --> 01:16:32,484
# And oh, how easily #

1273
01:16:32,521 --> 01:16:35,081
# You were distracted #

1274
01:16:37,826 --> 01:16:41,284
# And oh, how often #

1275
01:16:41,330 --> 01:16:44,060
# You overreacted #

1276
01:16:46,068 --> 01:16:50,767
# And oh, how easily #

1277
01:16:50,806 --> 01:16:53,070
# Deceived... #

1278
01:16:53,108 --> 01:16:55,633
Steve: There's just that sense
of security that you have

1279
01:16:55,677 --> 01:16:58,202
when you're wearing Watch Pal.

1280
01:16:58,246 --> 01:17:00,680
I mean, what do kids love?
A pal, a friend.

1281
01:17:00,716 --> 01:17:02,980
I mean, this is the product
that a kid can say,

1282
01:17:03,018 --> 01:17:05,452
"Hey, this is my pal.
I have my pal with me."

1283
01:17:05,487 --> 01:17:08,547
Please tell me this is
gonna be okay, Axle.

1284
01:17:08,590 --> 01:17:10,581
- We're gonna be fine.
- We're gonna be fine?

1285
01:17:10,626 --> 01:17:12,651
I don't know if you noticed,
but it's the same price.

1286
01:17:12,694 --> 01:17:15,185
He has got more games, and to be honest,
it looks a hell of a lot cooler.

1287
01:17:15,230 --> 01:17:17,323
- None of that matters.
- Kids love robots.

1288
01:17:17,366 --> 01:17:20,335
- They don't have compasses.
- Kids don't use compasses.

1289
01:17:20,369 --> 01:17:22,132
Maybe they need to.

1290
01:17:22,170 --> 01:17:25,333
- Maybe you should shut your mouth.
- Robert: Hey, guys, enough.

1291
01:17:26,775 --> 01:17:29,175
Now look, I'll admit
he's got a great product.

1292
01:17:29,211 --> 01:17:32,009
It's futuristic.
It's got a personality.

1293
01:17:32,047 --> 01:17:34,538
That's not making me
feel any better.

1294
01:17:34,583 --> 01:17:36,517
But what he doesn't have is me,

1295
01:17:36,551 --> 01:17:40,920
the first invention from Robert Axle
since the one that maimed 3000 people.

1296
01:17:40,956 --> 01:17:43,948
Nobody has more to prove.
Nobody's got more eyes on them.

1297
01:17:43,992 --> 01:17:46,984
An invention? I thought
we were calling them fabrications.

1298
01:17:47,029 --> 01:17:48,360
We're gonna get rid of that word,

1299
01:17:48,397 --> 01:17:49,796
'cause that word
is just tripping people up.

1300
01:17:49,831 --> 01:17:52,561
Let's call it an invention.
Call it whatever people need to call it

1301
01:17:52,601 --> 01:17:54,432
to know that this is the answer,

1302
01:17:54,469 --> 01:17:57,563
that this is what one of the most
prolific inventors in modern history

1303
01:17:57,606 --> 01:17:59,369
has been thinking about
for the past decade...

1304
01:17:59,408 --> 01:18:01,342
an idea with so much promise,

1305
01:18:01,376 --> 01:18:04,140
that's gonna so profoundly
impact child safety

1306
01:18:04,179 --> 01:18:06,875
that everyone's gonna forget
about all their missing fingers.

1307
01:18:06,915 --> 01:18:08,405
- Write that down.
- Write what down?

1308
01:18:08,450 --> 01:18:10,850
What he just said. It's important.
Before we forget, write it down.

1309
01:18:10,886 --> 01:18:13,320
- Isn't that Sheila's job?
- Write it down.

1310
01:18:15,424 --> 01:18:17,688
No, whoa whoa,
don't write on that.

1311
01:18:17,726 --> 01:18:21,321
- Okay. What is it?
- It's just my good luck charm.

1312
01:18:21,363 --> 01:18:23,263
All right, look... ooh.

1313
01:18:23,298 --> 01:18:25,095
Ow, that hurt.
Knee to the head... not good.

1314
01:18:25,133 --> 01:18:27,226
Look, in life you have to help
your partner.

1315
01:18:27,269 --> 01:18:29,260
Percy, way to get up high.

1316
01:18:29,304 --> 01:18:32,865
Look at Conner Ann, man.
Wow, you guys are doing good.

1317
01:18:32,908 --> 01:18:36,071
Good rope climbing, impressive.

1318
01:18:36,111 --> 01:18:38,671
All right, you're disgusting.
You smell.

1319
01:18:38,714 --> 01:18:40,545
Get the hell out of here.

1320
01:18:40,582 --> 01:18:43,278
Good work. Good job.

1321
01:18:55,197 --> 01:18:56,858
What do you want?

1322
01:18:56,898 --> 01:18:58,525
Could you give this
to Claire for me?

1323
01:18:58,567 --> 01:19:00,057
What is that?

1324
01:19:00,102 --> 01:19:02,366
It's an invitation
to the Watchdawg launch.

1325
01:19:02,404 --> 01:19:04,463
Well, why don't you
give it to her yourself?

1326
01:19:04,506 --> 01:19:05,996
'Cause she won't take it
from me.

1327
01:19:06,041 --> 01:19:08,771
She won't even answer her phone,
return my calls.

1328
01:19:08,810 --> 01:19:10,801
I wonder why.

1329
01:19:10,846 --> 01:19:13,314
Hey, I didn't steal that money,
all right? I was borrowing it.

1330
01:19:13,348 --> 01:19:15,976
I was doing everything I could
to save her business.

1331
01:19:16,017 --> 01:19:17,882
You were trying
to help yourself.

1332
01:19:17,919 --> 01:19:20,012
Well, the two aren't
mutually exclusive.

1333
01:19:20,055 --> 01:19:21,920
What you did is not some sort
of Robin Hood thing.

1334
01:19:21,957 --> 01:19:23,891
I mean, it was selfish.
It was wrong.

1335
01:19:23,925 --> 01:19:27,053
And frankly, it's the same shit you've
been doing to her since she was a kid.

1336
01:19:27,095 --> 01:19:29,086
Look, I'm a father
and I'm not gonna apologize

1337
01:19:29,131 --> 01:19:32,567
for trying to give my daughter
a great life.

1338
01:19:33,602 --> 01:19:35,092
(school bell rings)

1339
01:19:35,137 --> 01:19:38,004
You could have just mailed that.

1340
01:19:39,608 --> 01:19:40,905
What?

1341
01:19:40,942 --> 01:19:42,967
Your stupid invite...
you could have mailed it.

1342
01:19:43,011 --> 01:19:45,411
You didn't have to come here
to launder it through me.

1343
01:19:45,447 --> 01:19:48,211
I mean, this isn't seventh grade.

1344
01:19:48,250 --> 01:19:50,241
Um...

1345
01:19:57,192 --> 01:19:58,853
I wanted to see you.

1346
01:19:58,894 --> 01:20:01,795
It's the tits, right?

1347
01:20:01,830 --> 01:20:03,127
Excuse me?

1348
01:20:03,165 --> 01:20:04,826
Are they too low?

1349
01:20:04,866 --> 01:20:06,629
What are you talking about?

1350
01:20:06,668 --> 01:20:08,966
Well, 'cause, you know,
we kissed a few months ago

1351
01:20:09,004 --> 01:20:11,404
and I thought it was
really good.

1352
01:20:11,439 --> 01:20:13,430
And I don't know
what you thought,

1353
01:20:13,475 --> 01:20:16,444
but you got to my tits
and you shut down.

1354
01:20:16,478 --> 01:20:18,810
Would you stop saying
that word?

1355
01:20:18,847 --> 01:20:21,179
- Tits?
- Yeah.

1356
01:20:21,216 --> 01:20:23,582
Phoebe, I think you're terrific,

1357
01:20:23,618 --> 01:20:26,644
but the tough guy talk...
it just sells you short.

1358
01:20:28,890 --> 01:20:31,290
And I shut down
because you're my daughter's friend.

1359
01:20:37,599 --> 01:20:39,829
And the tits are fine, all right?
They're not too high.

1360
01:20:39,868 --> 01:20:43,804
They're not too low.
They're just right where you want them.

1361
01:20:50,445 --> 01:20:52,845
(tooting)

1362
01:20:52,881 --> 01:20:55,645
# Happy birthday. #

1363
01:20:57,953 --> 01:21:00,820
Can I meet you guys at the table
in one second?

1364
01:21:00,856 --> 01:21:03,381
- Okay, happy birthday. Love you.
- Happy birthday. We'll be right here.

1365
01:21:03,425 --> 01:21:05,950
We've got news.

1366
01:21:05,994 --> 01:21:07,985
Big news.

1367
01:21:08,029 --> 01:21:10,020
You're pregnant?

1368
01:21:10,065 --> 01:21:12,693
No, we're moving to Tampa.

1369
01:21:12,734 --> 01:21:14,929
- Tampa?
- I just want to relax

1370
01:21:14,970 --> 01:21:18,030
enjoying my husband
for a while.

1371
01:21:18,073 --> 01:21:20,234
Wait, what's this really about?

1372
01:21:20,275 --> 01:21:22,266
We got an offer on the house...

1373
01:21:22,310 --> 01:21:25,245
furniture, cars, everything as-is.

1374
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:27,407
So the only thing left
is your little blue house.

1375
01:21:27,449 --> 01:21:29,440
And with any luck,
we're gonna sell that today.

1376
01:21:29,484 --> 01:21:32,009
- Wait, to who?
- To you.

1377
01:21:32,053 --> 01:21:34,044
The price is $1.

1378
01:21:34,089 --> 01:21:36,683
Make the check payable
to Jerry King.

1379
01:21:39,194 --> 01:21:42,493
Guys, this is really
not necessary.

1380
01:21:44,032 --> 01:21:47,365
Sweetie, I think it's adorable
that you're working in a coffee shop,

1381
01:21:47,402 --> 01:21:50,701
but you had a career,
and a good one.

1382
01:21:50,739 --> 01:21:53,264
I will get back
to saving the world at some point,

1383
01:21:53,308 --> 01:21:55,902
but right now
I just need a break.

1384
01:21:55,944 --> 01:21:58,970
This is not a break.
This is a cop-out.

1385
01:22:00,148 --> 01:22:02,139
Claire, your mother loves you.

1386
01:22:02,183 --> 01:22:04,981
She just doesn't want to see you make
the same mistake she did.

1387
01:22:05,020 --> 01:22:08,217
Letting Robert Axle ruin her life?

1388
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:10,656
Not forgiving him.

1389
01:22:17,265 --> 01:22:19,290
I'd better go back to work.

1390
01:22:31,846 --> 01:22:34,679
G54.

1391
01:22:36,418 --> 01:22:39,410
- I26.
- Oh, this is for you.

1392
01:22:39,454 --> 01:22:41,615
It's from your dad.
He came by my school.

1393
01:22:41,656 --> 01:22:43,783
You still talk to my dad?

1394
01:22:43,825 --> 01:22:46,589
Woman: G49.

1395
01:22:49,731 --> 01:22:51,096
I kissed him, okay?

1396
01:22:51,132 --> 01:22:52,793
You kissed him?

1397
01:22:52,834 --> 01:22:54,859
I'm sorry.
I really feel like crap. I just...

1398
01:22:54,903 --> 01:22:57,201
- You should feel like crap.
- Donna, you're not helping.

1399
01:22:57,238 --> 01:22:59,934
I'm not trying to help. After everything
he's done, she's being nice to him?

1400
01:22:59,975 --> 01:23:02,102
Woman: O61.

1401
01:23:03,645 --> 01:23:06,079
It's just that he makes me feel,

1402
01:23:06,114 --> 01:23:09,811
like, funnier than I thought I was
and less hideous.

1403
01:23:09,851 --> 01:23:11,842
Woman: B5.

1404
01:23:11,886 --> 01:23:14,184
I don't know, it just felt good
not to be pissed off.

1405
01:23:14,222 --> 01:23:15,484
I'm sorry.

1406
01:23:15,523 --> 01:23:18,151
Bingo!
I got bingo.

1407
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:20,388
Bingo.

1408
01:23:20,428 --> 01:23:23,056
What's next
for one of the most prolific

1409
01:23:23,098 --> 01:23:26,829
and unpredictable inventors
in modern history?

1410
01:23:26,868 --> 01:23:29,962
In the room today,
financial movers and shakers,

1411
01:23:30,005 --> 01:23:32,701
also the tech-savvy
parents and kids

1412
01:23:32,741 --> 01:23:34,971
who are just excited
to see this latest invention.

1413
01:23:35,010 --> 01:23:37,376
Did I tell you
we're having a boy?

1414
01:23:38,580 --> 01:23:40,445
No, Matt, you didn't.
Congratulations.

1415
01:23:40,482 --> 01:23:42,245
Thank you.
I really wanted a boy.

1416
01:23:42,283 --> 01:23:46,310
You know, Matt, I haven't said it.
I really ought to before I go out there.

1417
01:23:46,354 --> 01:23:48,754
Not a lot of people would have
taken a second chance on me.

1418
01:23:48,790 --> 01:23:50,781
It means a lot to me.
Thank you so much.

1419
01:23:50,825 --> 01:23:52,850
I won't let you down.

1420
01:23:52,894 --> 01:23:55,624
Axle, I didn't take
a second chance on you

1421
01:23:55,663 --> 01:23:58,131
'cause I'm a good guy.

1422
01:23:58,166 --> 01:23:59,895
I did it because
I honestly believe

1423
01:23:59,934 --> 01:24:02,767
that you're gonna make me
one of the richest men in the world.

1424
01:24:07,442 --> 01:24:09,740
Sorry I'm late.
Hey, Sheila.

1425
01:24:09,778 --> 01:24:11,405
The traffic was brutal.

1426
01:24:11,446 --> 01:24:15,007
I had to go back by the office
and pick up your lucky picture.

1427
01:24:28,496 --> 01:24:32,489
Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Mr. Robert Axle.

1428
01:24:32,534 --> 01:24:34,559
(applause)

1429
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:47,875
Thank you very much.
Good afternoon.

1430
01:24:49,984 --> 01:24:52,350
From the moment
they are conceived,

1431
01:24:52,387 --> 01:24:54,412
our greatest fear as parents

1432
01:24:54,456 --> 01:24:56,856
is losing our child.

1433
01:24:56,891 --> 01:24:59,052
We do everything we can
to keep them near us

1434
01:24:59,094 --> 01:25:00,721
and keep them safe.

1435
01:25:06,701 --> 01:25:09,465
But sometimes they slip away.

1436
01:25:09,504 --> 01:25:13,372
It can happen in shopping malls,

1437
01:25:13,408 --> 01:25:15,774
airports.

1438
01:25:25,353 --> 01:25:28,754
You know, the...

1439
01:25:28,790 --> 01:25:32,055
the truth is
it's not always the kids that get lost.

1440
01:25:35,864 --> 01:25:38,230
Sometimes it's us...

1441
01:25:38,266 --> 01:25:42,032
the grown-ups, the parent.

1442
01:25:42,070 --> 01:25:46,063
And that's certainly true for me.

1443
01:25:47,075 --> 01:25:49,703
You see, I was convicted

1444
01:25:49,744 --> 01:25:52,008
of gross negligence
because of a product.

1445
01:25:52,046 --> 01:25:53,638
I mean, you all know that.

1446
01:25:55,783 --> 01:25:59,719
But what I'm really guilty of

1447
01:25:59,754 --> 01:26:03,053
is gross negligence
as a father.

1448
01:26:05,460 --> 01:26:07,155
And so here I am

1449
01:26:07,195 --> 01:26:11,325
giving you another
Robert Axle fabrication,

1450
01:26:11,366 --> 01:26:13,857
which is the last thing
I should be doing.

1451
01:26:13,902 --> 01:26:16,803
I mean, don't get me wrong.

1452
01:26:16,838 --> 01:26:19,136
Watchdawg is a good product.

1453
01:26:19,174 --> 01:26:22,632
It serves a purpose.
I'm sure a lot of people will enjoy it.

1454
01:26:24,746 --> 01:26:27,214
But it's a Band-Aid.

1455
01:26:29,517 --> 01:26:33,351
It's not gonna solve
the disconnect I have with my daughter

1456
01:26:33,388 --> 01:26:36,152
or the disconnect that any of us
have with our kids.

1457
01:26:36,191 --> 01:26:39,422
I mean, do we really need
another toy

1458
01:26:39,460 --> 01:26:41,553
to keep our kids distracted

1459
01:26:41,596 --> 01:26:45,054
so that we can feel free
to take our eye off the ball?

1460
01:26:51,573 --> 01:26:54,371
We have to learn
to connect to our kids

1461
01:26:54,409 --> 01:26:57,469
without the need for this

1462
01:26:57,512 --> 01:27:00,003
or the thousands
of other gadgets that we use

1463
01:27:00,048 --> 01:27:03,916
to distract ourselves from being
the best parent we can be.

1464
01:27:08,690 --> 01:27:11,181
'Cause this...

1465
01:27:14,929 --> 01:27:17,557
this isn't the answer
for me anymore.

1466
01:27:24,205 --> 01:27:27,470
(applause)

1467
01:27:31,713 --> 01:27:34,147
(cheering)

1468
01:27:51,899 --> 01:27:55,699
Sorry I missed your birthday.
How was it?

1469
01:27:55,737 --> 01:27:57,227
Good.

1470
01:27:57,272 --> 01:27:59,934
But I'm not
much of a birthday girl.

1471
01:27:59,974 --> 01:28:03,501
I see. I keep learning new things
about Claire Elizabeth every day...

1472
01:28:03,544 --> 01:28:05,535
not much of a birthday girl.

1473
01:28:05,580 --> 01:28:07,571
It's Claire Axle.

1474
01:28:07,615 --> 01:28:11,210
I'm kind of over the whole
Claire Elizabeth thing.

1475
01:28:13,921 --> 01:28:16,253
I'm glad to hear that.

1476
01:28:16,291 --> 01:28:18,054
- Axle!
- (tires screech)

1477
01:28:25,099 --> 01:28:28,034
You gotta get back there, man.
Matt's going out of his mind.

1478
01:28:28,069 --> 01:28:29,593
Why? Does he want to sue me?

1479
01:28:29,637 --> 01:28:31,366
Sue you?
He wants to back you.

1480
01:28:31,406 --> 01:28:32,805
Back me for what?

1481
01:28:32,840 --> 01:28:35,365
Ideas, inventions, consulting.
He doesn't care.

1482
01:28:35,410 --> 01:28:38,038
The buyers are going crazy.

1483
01:28:38,079 --> 01:28:40,547
Well, you tell Matt
I appreciate the gesture,

1484
01:28:40,581 --> 01:28:43,573
but I've got to get a job...

1485
01:28:43,618 --> 01:28:45,483
a real job.

1486
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:49,081
You've got a real job, Dad.

1487
01:28:49,123 --> 01:28:52,058
You're a fabricator.

1488
01:28:58,900 --> 01:29:01,562
Okay, I'm in.
But you tell him

1489
01:29:01,602 --> 01:29:04,901
that at the moment
I'm taking a walk with my daughter.

1490
01:29:04,939 --> 01:29:07,203
So you go back and work that room
for me, partner,

1491
01:29:07,241 --> 01:29:09,232
and I'll join up with you
as soon as I can.

1492
01:29:09,277 --> 01:29:11,268
I'm on it.

1493
01:29:11,312 --> 01:29:13,712
# You and I
look good together... #

1494
01:29:13,748 --> 01:29:15,648
No, you're going b...

1495
01:29:15,683 --> 01:29:18,083
# This day is getting #

1496
01:29:18,119 --> 01:29:20,485
# A lot better #

1497
01:29:20,521 --> 01:29:22,512
# Let's get inside #

1498
01:29:22,557 --> 01:29:25,458
# Out of this weather #

1499
01:29:25,493 --> 01:29:28,018
# There is no one #

1500
01:29:28,062 --> 01:29:30,622
# Loves you better #

1501
01:29:30,665 --> 01:29:33,099
# Than me, my dear... #

1502
01:29:33,134 --> 01:29:36,126
Claire: Does that guy Troy
have a girlfriend?

1503
01:29:36,170 --> 01:29:39,105
Robert: Are you serious
or are you just trying to freak me out?

1504
01:29:39,140 --> 01:29:41,676
(Claire chuckles)
A little of both.

1505
01:29:42,043 --> 01:29:44,204
(piano music playing)

1506
01:29:48,516 --> 01:29:52,282
Jerry:
# When I first met you, love #

1507
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:55,585
# We held hands
and never looked back #

1508
01:29:55,623 --> 01:29:59,115
Lorraine:
# And I'll never let you go #

1509
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:02,095
# Even though my family was
freaked out that you were black #

1510
01:30:02,130 --> 01:30:05,725
# And now I'm just like a kitten #

1511
01:30:05,767 --> 01:30:09,203
# And I'm rolling around
in the grass #

1512
01:30:09,237 --> 01:30:13,105
Jerry: # Come here,
precious little kitty #

1513
01:30:13,141 --> 01:30:15,905
# I'm about to tap that ass #

1514
01:30:15,943 --> 01:30:19,276
Together:
# I'm in love #

1515
01:30:19,313 --> 01:30:22,578
# With you #

1516
01:30:22,617 --> 01:30:25,643
# Ooh, I'm in love #

1517
01:30:25,686 --> 01:30:29,349
# With you #

1518
01:30:29,390 --> 01:30:31,085
- # You're my woman #
- # All we need #

1519
01:30:31,125 --> 01:30:33,150
- # I'm in love with you #
- # All we need is love #

1520
01:30:33,194 --> 01:30:35,719
- # And that's all we need #
- # All we need #

1521
01:30:35,763 --> 01:30:39,392
- # Is love #
- # Is love #

1522
01:30:39,434 --> 01:30:41,834
- # We don't need no money #
- # Rolling around, rolling around #

1523
01:30:41,869 --> 01:30:45,965
Lorraine: # Rolling around in the grass,
all we need, tap my ass #

1524
01:30:46,007 --> 01:30:48,202
Jerry: # Tap that ass in the grass,
I'ma tap that ass #

1525
01:30:48,242 --> 01:30:52,235
- # Tap my ass, tap my ass, tap my ass #
- # In the grass #

1526
01:30:52,280 --> 01:30:55,181
# You're the precious kitty cat,
I'ma hit the kitty cat #

1527
01:30:55,216 --> 01:30:58,777
- # In the ass in the grass #
- # I'm in love, I'm in love #

1528
01:30:58,820 --> 01:31:01,118
# When I tap that ass,
tap that ass #

1529
01:31:01,155 --> 01:31:03,623
# I'm in love, I'm in love #

1530
01:31:03,658 --> 01:31:07,492
- # I'm in love #
- # I love you too-oo #

1531
01:31:08,830 --> 01:31:12,425
# I'm in love with you #

1532
01:31:12,467 --> 01:31:14,298
# Me too-oo #

1533
01:31:15,303 --> 01:31:19,433
# I'm in love with you. #

1534
01:31:20,908 --> 01:31:24,207
(instrumental music playing)

1535
01:31:55,376 --> 01:31:57,537
(pop ballad playing)

1536
01:32:14,295 --> 01:32:16,286
# Speak to me #

1537
01:32:16,330 --> 01:32:19,925
# I swear I'm listening #

1538
01:32:23,371 --> 01:32:26,272
# Show me all the things #

1539
01:32:26,307 --> 01:32:28,639
# I'm missing #

1540
01:32:32,413 --> 01:32:34,643
# And let me kindly #

1541
01:32:34,682 --> 01:32:37,173
# Step aside #

1542
01:32:37,218 --> 01:32:41,382
# Let these heavenly objects collide #

1543
01:32:41,422 --> 01:32:43,413
# Speak to me #

1544
01:32:43,457 --> 01:32:47,052
# I'm finally listening #

1545
01:32:48,863 --> 01:32:53,232
# And oh, how easily #

1546
01:32:53,267 --> 01:32:55,701
# Deceived #

1547
01:32:55,736 --> 01:32:59,968
