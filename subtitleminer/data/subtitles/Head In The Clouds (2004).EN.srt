1
00:02:33,301 --> 00:02:34,780
There she is.

2
00:02:36,998 --> 00:02:39,694
Bonjour, madame. How much for a reading?

3
00:02:40,173 --> 00:02:43,304
Three francs, dear,
and it's written on the door.

4
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm sorry.

5
00:03:00,699 --> 00:03:02,092
I cannot see.

6
00:03:03,484 --> 00:03:06,615
- We've got to go. We're late.
- We'll miss the bus.

7
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:08,484
Thank you, madame.

8
00:03:21,792 --> 00:03:23,401
What do you see?

9
00:03:29,403 --> 00:03:31,621
I see your 34th year.

10
00:04:13,197 --> 00:04:14,501
Shut up.

11
00:04:20,634 --> 00:04:22,200
That's the porter.

12
00:04:22,504 --> 00:04:25,331
He spotted me as I was making my getaway.

13
00:04:28,811 --> 00:04:31,506
These are first-year rooms, aren't they?

14
00:04:32,724 --> 00:04:34,637
They're very luxurious.

15
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:37,638
The ones at Yale are like monk's cells.

16
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:44,119
"Aristotle and Virtue." Oh, God, I'm sorry.

17
00:04:44,205 --> 00:04:47,641
- It doesn't matter.
- Of course it does. I ruined them.

18
00:04:49,424 --> 00:04:50,511
Wait.

19
00:04:55,121 --> 00:04:57,644
It's getting heavier out there, huh?

20
00:04:57,731 --> 00:05:02,036
- Do you mind if I stay here till it eases off?
- No. Of course you can.

21
00:05:02,645 --> 00:05:06,342
- I go out with one of the dons.
- I know. Julian Ellsworth.

22
00:05:06,646 --> 00:05:10,126
We just had an awful row.
I can't go back to his rooms.

23
00:05:11,343 --> 00:05:13,648
I have to get out of these togs.

24
00:05:14,909 --> 00:05:16,214
Excuse me.

25
00:05:18,911 --> 00:05:20,041
Help.

26
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:23,737
It's completely stuck to me.

27
00:05:24,911 --> 00:05:26,912
I don't mind if it tears.

28
00:05:34,436 --> 00:05:35,653
Thanks.

29
00:05:39,437 --> 00:05:40,829
Bless you.

30
00:05:42,743 --> 00:05:46,353
I can't let you go out in this.
You can sleep in my bed.

31
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:49,527
But we haven't been introduced.

32
00:05:50,354 --> 00:05:53,050
I'll sleep on the chair and keep watch.

33
00:05:53,441 --> 00:05:57,355
That's very noble, but I wouldn't dream
of kidnapping your bed.

34
00:05:57,746 --> 00:06:01,052
You're taking a terrible risk
having me here at all.

35
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:25,928
- Sorry.
- No. Don't apologize.

36
00:06:26,755 --> 00:06:29,755
- I'm flattered.
- It doesn't normally...

37
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:32,843
I should hope it does.

38
00:06:37,931 --> 00:06:40,540
- I'm Gilda Bessé.
- I know who you are.

39
00:06:41,454 --> 00:06:44,541
- That sounds ominous.
- You're famous around here.

40
00:06:44,672 --> 00:06:47,368
- Where are you from?
- Dublin originally.

41
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,935
- We moved up north after the Treaty.
- Why was that?

42
00:06:52,456 --> 00:06:54,544
My father was a policeman.

43
00:06:55,545 --> 00:06:58,154
And he was killed during the Troubles.

44
00:07:00,676 --> 00:07:02,851
So are you British or Irish?

45
00:07:03,242 --> 00:07:07,461
On paper, I'm British.
But I don't believe in countries much.

46
00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:09,853
Nor do I.

47
00:07:13,245 --> 00:07:16,550
- How did you end up here?
- I got a scholarship.

48
00:07:18,159 --> 00:07:21,681
Beauty, bravery, and brains.

49
00:07:26,248 --> 00:07:27,771
What a catch.

50
00:07:29,945 --> 00:07:33,772
You also have a nice willy,
and I hope to dream about it.

51
00:07:40,252 --> 00:07:43,253
- Good night, Guy.
- Good night.

52
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:15,479
We made it. I owe you my life.

53
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:19,480
You don't owe me anything. It was fun.

54
00:08:25,482 --> 00:08:27,481
Everyone knew Gilda Bessé.

55
00:08:28,177 --> 00:08:31,178
Her father owned
one of the big French champagne houses.

56
00:08:31,221 --> 00:08:33,962
Her mother was a rich American socialite.

57
00:08:34,266 --> 00:08:35,875
The marriage hadn't lasted...

58
00:08:35,962 --> 00:08:39,267
and Gilda had lived most of her life
in the United States.

59
00:08:39,398 --> 00:08:42,094
She was quite notorious at Cambridge...

60
00:08:42,398 --> 00:08:45,574
and last night,
she had actually slept in my bed.

61
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,270
If anyone knew, I'd be a celebrity overnight.

62
00:08:53,706 --> 00:08:55,402
Are you Guy Malyon?

63
00:08:57,402 --> 00:08:59,403
- Yeah.
- Julian Ellsworth.

64
00:09:01,404 --> 00:09:04,882
I'm incredibly grateful about the other night.
Gilda said you were a brick.

65
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:07,579
I really can't thank you enough.
You saved my bacon.

66
00:09:07,709 --> 00:09:11,493
I'd have been dismissed and most likely
disinherited if they'd found her here.

67
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,972
Glad to have been of help.

68
00:09:13,102 --> 00:09:15,712
Listen, we're having a bit of a beano
at the weekend.

69
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:17,495
Gilda wanted me to invite you.

70
00:09:17,582 --> 00:09:19,583
Don't know
if you're much of a jitterbugger...

71
00:09:19,713 --> 00:09:22,105
but the old man's away,
I'll have the run of the place.

72
00:09:22,191 --> 00:09:24,279
You need a girl, of course.

73
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:26,192
I can line one up.

74
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:29,716
When I was a freshman,
I didn't know what girls were.

75
00:09:36,499 --> 00:09:40,979
I'm afraid Mr. Ellsworth won't allow you in
unless you first drink one of these.

76
00:09:41,109 --> 00:09:42,980
The password is "martini."

77
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:46,981
God, it tastes like paraffin!

78
00:09:47,111 --> 00:09:49,894
One doesn't taste it, darling,
one simply swallows.

79
00:09:49,982 --> 00:09:51,591
- New blood.
- Hello, old boy.

80
00:09:52,983 --> 00:09:55,505
You girls should want to dance with me
this evening...

81
00:09:55,591 --> 00:09:57,723
because Gilda has got herself
stranded in Calais.

82
00:09:57,809 --> 00:10:00,115
- Poor Gilda.
- Do come through.

83
00:10:00,506 --> 00:10:02,419
Calais is such a dreadful place.

84
00:10:02,724 --> 00:10:03,811
- Hello, Guy.
- Hi.

85
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:05,508
Glad you could make it.

86
00:10:37,908 --> 00:10:39,517
You're the troubled boy...

87
00:10:39,603 --> 00:10:42,213
whose girlfriend
Julian is planning to monster.

88
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:45,126
- Are you sad?
- I'm thrilled for her.

89
00:10:45,517 --> 00:10:47,518
You don't mind if she gets debauched?

90
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:51,998
So long as the debaucher's from a
fucking good family, I couldn't care less.

91
00:10:52,433 --> 00:10:56,129
Do you imagine you're being
incredibly daring using words like that?

92
00:10:56,217 --> 00:10:59,827
You should try them sometime.
It's good for constipation.

93
00:11:21,441 --> 00:11:24,310
I'm going to feel so wicked in the morning.

94
00:11:29,225 --> 00:11:31,008
What are you writing?

95
00:11:31,139 --> 00:11:33,313
An ode to your tummy button.

96
00:11:45,143 --> 00:11:48,448
- Gilda.
- Sir Knight.

97
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:52,319
- Don't go up there.
- Why shouldn't I go upstairs?

98
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:55,927
- There's an orgy going on.
- Sounds promising.

99
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:58,537
My partner for the evening's
the main course.

100
00:11:58,624 --> 00:12:01,755
Your partner isn't Molly Twelvetrees,
by any chance, is she?

101
00:12:01,843 --> 00:12:05,017
Yeah. She's in danger of catching a cold.

102
00:12:06,148 --> 00:12:09,758
- Julian's writing a poem on her stomach.
- What a cad.

103
00:12:10,323 --> 00:12:11,845
Don't you mind?

104
00:12:11,932 --> 00:12:14,845
I feel sorry for Molly. He's a terrible poet.

105
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,021
You're very modern, aren't you?

106
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:24,153
I don't feel very comfortable here.

107
00:12:24,457 --> 00:12:26,458
I feel guilty being around all this wealth.

108
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:29,762
It's just a game. Don't take it seriously.

109
00:12:30,024 --> 00:12:34,546
It's not much of a game if you're out of work
and trying to feed a family.

110
00:12:34,851 --> 00:12:36,634
Fortunately, I'm not.

111
00:12:38,156 --> 00:12:39,939
And neither are you.

112
00:12:41,244 --> 00:12:44,028
I only came here tonight to see you.

113
00:12:44,767 --> 00:12:47,550
- There, I've said it.
- Good.

114
00:12:51,551 --> 00:12:53,161
You look lovely.

115
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:57,031
You don't.

116
00:13:01,467 --> 00:13:05,337
Your eyes are all red.
You look like a bloodhound.

117
00:13:35,476 --> 00:13:38,477
You have excellent recuperative powers.

118
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:43,173
- What if someone comes?
- We were here first.

119
00:13:47,653 --> 00:13:50,175
- Oh, God!
- Think Sunday School.

120
00:13:50,263 --> 00:13:52,655
- What?
- Think Sunday School.

121
00:13:52,785 --> 00:13:56,263
- Why?
- Because this is a team sport.

122
00:14:13,486 --> 00:14:15,051
Thank you, Unwin.

123
00:14:15,094 --> 00:14:18,574
- I thought it might be prudent to...
- Good idea.

124
00:14:18,661 --> 00:14:20,270
Good morning, Unwin.

125
00:14:20,357 --> 00:14:24,184
I thought we might have breakfast
on the terrace this morning.

126
00:14:24,576 --> 00:14:27,664
Gilda!
What on earth are you doing down here?

127
00:14:27,968 --> 00:14:29,968
Happy birthday, darling.

128
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:35,274
- Who's that?
- My friend, Guy.

129
00:14:36,274 --> 00:14:38,580
You really had your hands full when I got in.

130
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:40,972
Gilda, he's a virtual primitive.

131
00:14:41,058 --> 00:14:45,277
I know. He's the Piltdown man.
I'm planning to exhibit him.

132
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:49,799
- Julian, nothing happened.
- I don't for a moment think anything did.

133
00:14:49,887 --> 00:14:53,366
Apart from us writing sonnets
all over each other.

134
00:14:53,974 --> 00:14:57,367
All right. Do you mind getting up, please,
before anyone else sees you?

135
00:14:57,498 --> 00:15:00,976
Be a darling and lend me
your dressing gown, would you?

136
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,977
Gilda, what have you got on under there?

137
00:15:04,065 --> 00:15:06,064
Well, seeing it's your big day...

138
00:15:06,107 --> 00:15:08,979
I'm wearing my birthday suit in your honor.

139
00:15:12,675 --> 00:15:16,502
I thought for certain I would hear
that Gilda and Julian had broken up...

140
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:19,677
but nothing seemed
to have changed between them.

141
00:15:21,895 --> 00:15:23,069
A few weeks passed...

142
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:26,374
and just when I'd resigned myself
to never being with her again...

143
00:15:26,505 --> 00:15:28,680
something unexpected happened.

144
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:34,985
- The divorce was at least 12 years ago.
- Yeah, she must be devastated.

145
00:15:52,686 --> 00:15:53,990
Can I join?

146
00:15:56,382 --> 00:15:59,296
That's five shillings annual membership fee.

147
00:16:02,906 --> 00:16:06,690
I read about your mother.
It must have been awful.

148
00:16:08,212 --> 00:16:10,604
She was a stranger to me, really.

149
00:16:14,082 --> 00:16:17,214
- But how have you been?
- Practicing my billiards.

150
00:16:19,389 --> 00:16:22,998
I wanted to see you,
to tell you that I'm leaving England.

151
00:16:23,302 --> 00:16:24,303
Why?

152
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:27,999
The wanderlust has got me. I want to travel.

153
00:16:28,608 --> 00:16:30,087
Where will you go?

154
00:16:30,217 --> 00:16:32,391
I loved the Arabian Nights
when I was younger.

155
00:16:32,523 --> 00:16:34,392
Maybe I'll start there.

156
00:16:36,393 --> 00:16:39,002
Would you like a traveling companion?

157
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:42,394
You have to finish your degree.

158
00:16:46,222 --> 00:16:49,396
- Does Julian know?
- I'll leave him a nice letter.

159
00:16:51,527 --> 00:16:55,093
You're the one friend from this chapter
I'd like to keep.

160
00:17:00,095 --> 00:17:03,008
Three weeks later, Gilda left England.

161
00:17:03,096 --> 00:17:05,923
And so began
our one-sided correspondence.

162
00:17:06,096 --> 00:17:10,924
For she was never in one place long enough
for my letters to catch up with her.

163
00:17:12,925 --> 00:17:15,403
After a year, she stopped writing.

164
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:20,317
By the time I graduated and began teaching
in the East End of London...

165
00:17:20,405 --> 00:17:23,232
I'd managed to finally put her behind me.

166
00:17:25,015 --> 00:17:27,537
Civil war had broken out in Spain...

167
00:17:27,624 --> 00:17:30,016
and I was campaigning
for the Republican side...

168
00:17:30,058 --> 00:17:32,842
in its increasingly desperate fight
against the Fascists.

169
00:17:35,234 --> 00:17:38,714
Tiberius is in a bad mood!
Where are those slaves?

170
00:17:57,632 --> 00:18:00,545
We'll see how brave you are
in the Coliseum.

171
00:18:00,937 --> 00:18:03,242
Take away their drinking water.

172
00:18:03,329 --> 00:18:06,547
I hadn't had a letter from her
for almost a year.

173
00:18:06,939 --> 00:18:10,027
But Gilda always
had an uncanny sense of timing.

174
00:18:10,852 --> 00:18:12,419
She was back in Paris...

175
00:18:12,461 --> 00:18:15,724
telling me a whole new chapter of her life
was beginning...

176
00:18:15,854 --> 00:18:17,854
and demanding I visit her.

177
00:18:29,249 --> 00:18:31,727
Once more, nothing else in the world
existed for me.

178
00:19:24,742 --> 00:19:25,742
Bonjour.

179
00:19:30,047 --> 00:19:32,874
Guy! You came! And so soon!

180
00:19:32,917 --> 00:19:35,440
Well, you finally sent me an address.

181
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:43,746
Look at you. Suddenly you're a man.

182
00:19:43,789 --> 00:19:45,443
I even shave now.

183
00:19:46,443 --> 00:19:49,574
- How long can you stay?
- Only till tomorrow. I have to work.

184
00:19:49,662 --> 00:19:52,575
That's ridiculous.
You have to stay for at least a month.

185
00:20:01,664 --> 00:20:04,883
- You'll be able to see my show.
- What sort of show?

186
00:20:05,274 --> 00:20:06,883
You'll see tonight.

187
00:20:06,971 --> 00:20:10,275
I saw you in a film as a slave
in ancient Rome.

188
00:20:11,058 --> 00:20:13,450
- Wasn't it ludicrous?
- How did you get the part?

189
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:17,581
I met an American cameraman
and went back to Hollywood with him.

190
00:20:17,973 --> 00:20:20,582
At first I wanted to be an actress...

191
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:23,583
but then I got more interested in cameras.

192
00:20:26,584 --> 00:20:29,280
I'd pick his brains in bed every night.

193
00:20:34,281 --> 00:20:36,065
Are you married yet?

194
00:20:36,673 --> 00:20:38,370
- Not quite.
- Good.

195
00:20:39,065 --> 00:20:41,980
I'm sure you have a menagerie of admirers.

196
00:20:42,979 --> 00:20:47,154
- So what do you do after work?
- I raise money for Republican Spain.

197
00:20:47,285 --> 00:20:49,460
I forgot you had a conscience.

198
00:20:51,373 --> 00:20:53,287
Max! This is Guy.

199
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:58,157
He just arrived from London.

200
00:20:58,766 --> 00:21:02,159
Welcome to Paris.
Are you here for the opening?

201
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:05,986
He doesn't know anything about it,
so he'll be completely objective.

202
00:21:06,072 --> 00:21:07,290
Right.

203
00:21:08,378 --> 00:21:10,161
Where are you staying?

204
00:21:10,204 --> 00:21:12,988
There's a hotel my friends like,
just around the corner.

205
00:21:13,074 --> 00:21:14,684
He's staying here.

206
00:21:15,684 --> 00:21:18,467
He and Mia can sing each other to sleep.

207
00:21:19,076 --> 00:21:20,164
Good.

208
00:21:20,989 --> 00:21:23,381
This is going to be incredibly glamorous,
isn't it?

209
00:21:23,469 --> 00:21:25,773
And I'm going to be incredibly dowdy.

210
00:21:25,904 --> 00:21:28,296
You're British. People expect it.

211
00:21:28,688 --> 00:21:30,079
Do you mind?

212
00:21:42,473 --> 00:21:44,170
So Max is a lover?

213
00:21:44,474 --> 00:21:46,301
He owns the gallery.

214
00:21:46,909 --> 00:21:49,171
Actually, he's good company...

215
00:21:49,693 --> 00:21:52,694
but he's become
extremely proprietorial lately.

216
00:21:54,173 --> 00:21:57,478
- He's on very thin ice.
- Then I hope it melts.

217
00:22:00,478 --> 00:22:01,783
Don't sulk.

218
00:22:02,697 --> 00:22:05,393
I didn't know you were coming so soon.

219
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:08,002
And anyway...

220
00:22:08,393 --> 00:22:12,003
I'm sure you're not sleeping alone
in London every night.

221
00:22:53,318 --> 00:22:57,711
Moments of yearning. Lust, vanity, and joy.

222
00:22:58,493 --> 00:23:00,799
Loves won and lost.

223
00:23:02,016 --> 00:23:04,408
It's an honor to be the first to host
the work...

224
00:23:04,495 --> 00:23:06,800
of this gifted new photographer.

225
00:23:07,496 --> 00:23:11,932
Finally, as a bonus,
may I present a living sculpture...

226
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:14,193
created especially for tonight?

227
00:24:07,208 --> 00:24:10,948
The pictures were good of their kind.
But the sculptures were something else.

228
00:24:11,034 --> 00:24:13,340
The trouble is we're never going
to see them again.

229
00:24:13,426 --> 00:24:16,949
You should film them, Gilda.
Record them for posterity.

230
00:24:17,123 --> 00:24:19,950
They need to be live,
so people can lean over...

231
00:24:20,037 --> 00:24:22,429
and smell the skin of the models.

232
00:24:24,038 --> 00:24:25,647
Does that worry you, Mia?

233
00:24:25,733 --> 00:24:28,648
Having people sniffing around you
like dogs?

234
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:31,735
I'm a sculpture, so I ignore them.

235
00:24:32,735 --> 00:24:34,215
What about you, Guy?

236
00:24:34,258 --> 00:24:37,128
Have you seen anything like that
in England?

237
00:24:37,433 --> 00:24:38,955
No, I haven't.

238
00:24:39,738 --> 00:24:41,738
Guy thinks art should be political.

239
00:24:41,826 --> 00:24:46,131
In London, he spends most of his time
campaigning for Republican Spain.

240
00:24:46,522 --> 00:24:49,523
German artists spent the last 15 years
lampooning the Nazis...

241
00:24:49,566 --> 00:24:51,045
and had no effect at all.

242
00:24:51,132 --> 00:24:52,828
At least they tried.

243
00:24:53,133 --> 00:24:56,525
Rather pointless if all they achieve
is a ticket to one of those camps.

244
00:24:56,655 --> 00:25:01,135
And the satisfaction of knowing
they had the courage of their convictions.

245
00:25:05,832 --> 00:25:08,050
Here's to judicious cowardice.

246
00:25:08,136 --> 00:25:12,746
No. Here's to Mia,
whose beauty inspired us all.

247
00:25:14,659 --> 00:25:18,139
You should model for Coco Chanel.
I could introduce you.

248
00:25:18,835 --> 00:25:21,053
Mia's training to be a nurse.

249
00:25:21,444 --> 00:25:24,662
She only models in her spare time,
and I have an exclusive contract.

250
00:25:24,705 --> 00:25:28,663
But I do feel I've seen you before.
I never forget a face.

251
00:25:29,664 --> 00:25:32,056
Perhaps you saw me at Le Grand Jeu.

252
00:25:35,144 --> 00:25:38,144
So how do you carry on
your crusade for Spain?

253
00:25:38,361 --> 00:25:41,841
Do you sit on a committee
and hand out pamphlets in the street?

254
00:25:41,971 --> 00:25:43,842
And if you really feel so strongly...

255
00:25:43,972 --> 00:25:46,234
why don't you enlist
in the International Brigades?

256
00:25:46,364 --> 00:25:48,147
I plan to at the end of school term.

257
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:50,365
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, I am.

258
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:53,236
Well, the line must be drawn.

259
00:25:53,452 --> 00:25:56,671
Fascism must be stopped
before it engulfs us all.

260
00:25:56,714 --> 00:25:58,062
Good night.

261
00:26:00,063 --> 00:26:04,064
- You've become so serious.
- The world has become serious.

262
00:26:04,978 --> 00:26:06,978
We'll all die of gravity.

263
00:26:08,762 --> 00:26:11,458
I'm sorry I can't be with you tonight.

264
00:26:11,545 --> 00:26:14,371
- Do you even like him?
- Occasionally.

265
00:26:16,545 --> 00:26:20,155
But I admit,
he's trying a little too hard at the moment.

266
00:26:20,547 --> 00:26:23,852
Mia, get out of the bath!
You'll turn into a prune!

267
00:26:25,853 --> 00:26:28,158
I take it Le Grand Jeu is a cabaret?

268
00:26:28,245 --> 00:26:30,245
Burlesque. Striptease.

269
00:26:30,853 --> 00:26:33,854
She came here with nothing.
She's my protégé.

270
00:26:34,072 --> 00:26:36,551
I want the three of us to be friends.

271
00:26:36,594 --> 00:26:38,464
Gilda, are you coming?

272
00:26:54,773 --> 00:26:56,861
I'll see you in the morning.

273
00:27:08,386 --> 00:27:10,255
This one's comfortable.

274
00:27:11,082 --> 00:27:13,779
I used to sleep here when I first came.

275
00:27:14,474 --> 00:27:17,387
- How long have you been here?
- Half a year.

276
00:27:17,779 --> 00:27:20,084
Whereabouts in Spain are you from?

277
00:27:20,127 --> 00:27:23,085
Asturias. In the north.

278
00:27:27,999 --> 00:27:30,783
Don't be jealous. He's not special to her.

279
00:27:31,695 --> 00:27:33,262
None of them are.

280
00:27:53,702 --> 00:27:55,485
He wants you to hear.

281
00:27:55,876 --> 00:27:58,486
He's afraid of her feelings for you.

282
00:27:59,573 --> 00:28:02,269
Yeah, well, I'm afraid of mine for her.

283
00:28:23,275 --> 00:28:25,189
- Who is it?
- It's me.

284
00:28:26,884 --> 00:28:31,407
How dare you be so pathetically
melodramatic walking out on me like that?

285
00:28:31,581 --> 00:28:34,190
What's there to drink? I'm bone dry.

286
00:28:39,018 --> 00:28:40,106
Hello.

287
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:44,497
- This is Linda.
- Hello, Gilda.

288
00:28:45,194 --> 00:28:47,107
I'm sorry I woke you.

289
00:28:48,586 --> 00:28:50,281
I got seasick on the boat...

290
00:28:50,413 --> 00:28:53,891
and then I tried to eat something
to settle my stomach...

291
00:28:54,022 --> 00:28:56,718
but the food in this country is awful.

292
00:29:00,023 --> 00:29:02,894
- Is this a bad time?
- What do you think?

293
00:29:07,286 --> 00:29:09,026
Does Max know you're here?

294
00:29:09,113 --> 00:29:12,505
Max was being very boring about you,
so I expelled him.

295
00:29:13,592 --> 00:29:16,202
I'm not going to let you go
and get yourself killed.

296
00:29:16,289 --> 00:29:18,506
You'd probably come back
with your brain shot out.

297
00:29:18,549 --> 00:29:21,421
Conversations would be
incredibly one-sided.

298
00:29:22,725 --> 00:29:25,900
Now, get me a blanket
and you can go back to bed.

299
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:34,293
- What are you doing?
- I'm going.

300
00:29:35,294 --> 00:29:38,425
She's sleeping in there.
I'm just getting her some bedclothes.

301
00:29:38,512 --> 00:29:41,426
Guy, I was with you at the cinema.

302
00:29:41,904 --> 00:29:44,426
After you saw her,
you hardly spoke the rest of the day.

303
00:29:44,514 --> 00:29:48,733
And when you got her letter,
you couldn't get on a train fast enough.

304
00:29:49,298 --> 00:29:50,602
I'm off.

305
00:29:51,124 --> 00:29:54,733
- There's no need.
- I've got an early start in the morning.

306
00:29:55,125 --> 00:29:58,126
And besides, I think I'm a bit in the way.

307
00:30:11,042 --> 00:30:13,825
- You didn't ask her to leave, did you?
- No.

308
00:30:14,739 --> 00:30:18,305
Seeing as she has,
I suppose I don't have to sleep rough.

309
00:30:46,616 --> 00:30:49,531
You've no idea
how I adored you at Cambridge.

310
00:30:50,226 --> 00:30:53,445
And when I arrived here,
nothing had changed.

311
00:30:53,836 --> 00:30:55,533
It was miraculous.

312
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:58,229
I couldn't stand lying
on the other side of that door...

313
00:30:58,316 --> 00:31:01,926
listening to you and your lover, though.
That was torture.

314
00:31:02,056 --> 00:31:03,448
Don't worry.

315
00:31:08,231 --> 00:31:10,232
I'm still in good voice.

316
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:14,537
By the time we're finished...

317
00:31:14,625 --> 00:31:17,842
you'll be so conceited,
you'll be insufferable.

318
00:31:28,062 --> 00:31:29,933
How do you like my tie?

319
00:31:32,237 --> 00:31:33,759
It's perfect.

320
00:32:53,085 --> 00:32:55,260
So how did you and Mia meet?

321
00:32:55,564 --> 00:32:58,652
I saw her on the street.
Followed her to a café.

322
00:32:59,869 --> 00:33:03,087
You choose people, don't you?
"Come into my life."

323
00:33:03,784 --> 00:33:07,871
Sometimes you see complete strangers,
but there's something special about them...

324
00:33:07,959 --> 00:33:10,351
and you think,
"I should really try and talk to them...

325
00:33:10,481 --> 00:33:13,351
"because I'll never see them again,"
but you don't...

326
00:33:13,482 --> 00:33:15,265
because it's not done.

327
00:33:15,352 --> 00:33:17,353
But it's all fated, anyway.

328
00:33:17,395 --> 00:33:20,788
It had to be your room
I came into that night in Cambridge.

329
00:33:20,875 --> 00:33:22,353
What do you mean?

330
00:33:22,396 --> 00:33:26,094
The whole room was familiar.
I'd seen it before in dreams.

331
00:33:26,572 --> 00:33:29,964
It probably reminded you of some place
you've been before.

332
00:33:30,095 --> 00:33:32,182
We just think we've dreamt things.

333
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:34,095
You're so complacent!

334
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:37,879
The mind isn't a physical thing
like the rest of the body.

335
00:33:37,922 --> 00:33:42,185
Maybe it can jump forward in dreams.
Maybe it doesn't have to obey physical laws.

336
00:33:42,227 --> 00:33:43,968
But if my room was already there...

337
00:33:44,011 --> 00:33:47,360
then that would mean
everything was fixed in advance.

338
00:33:51,666 --> 00:33:54,188
You think I was being spontaneous...

339
00:33:54,797 --> 00:33:56,971
but I was always going to do that.

340
00:33:57,014 --> 00:34:00,103
Just as I was always
going to win this argument.

341
00:34:17,107 --> 00:34:19,369
That's what I learned at school.

342
00:34:19,586 --> 00:34:21,673
I've got to work out what I'm going to do.

343
00:34:21,804 --> 00:34:24,804
- Resign from your teaching for a start.
- And what do I live on?

344
00:34:24,892 --> 00:34:28,284
- I'll give you a job as my assistant.
- How's the pay?

345
00:34:28,893 --> 00:34:30,111
Good bonuses.

346
00:34:30,197 --> 00:34:32,372
I listen to them every night.

347
00:34:32,589 --> 00:34:35,677
- Do we keep you awake?
- She can sleep through anything.

348
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:39,287
She has amazing conversations in her sleep.
Three or four people.

349
00:34:39,329 --> 00:34:41,983
Sometimes speaking different languages.

350
00:34:43,592 --> 00:34:45,202
So, do you accept?

351
00:34:58,118 --> 00:35:00,205
You odious little boy. How's that?

352
00:35:00,292 --> 00:35:03,293
Now the horrible little girl
has turned around.

353
00:35:29,691 --> 00:35:32,997
Hello. We're just off to the pictures.

354
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:44,826
So, Guy...

355
00:35:45,391 --> 00:35:48,392
you have forsaken London
for the City of Light?

356
00:35:48,523 --> 00:35:49,915
It seems so.

357
00:35:50,131 --> 00:35:51,131
Mia!

358
00:35:55,306 --> 00:35:57,133
- Change in here.
- Why?

359
00:35:57,612 --> 00:35:59,004
He came to the exhibition.

360
00:35:59,134 --> 00:36:01,396
He won't be seeing anything
he hasn't seen before.

361
00:36:01,526 --> 00:36:05,136
You were part of my sculpture.
You're flesh and blood now.

362
00:36:05,614 --> 00:36:08,006
What are you doing
going out with him, anyway?

363
00:36:08,048 --> 00:36:09,398
I'm curious.

364
00:36:09,528 --> 00:36:11,615
You know what they say about him.

365
00:36:11,658 --> 00:36:14,007
You should hear what they say about you.

366
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:20,009
Your dresser has excelled herself.

367
00:36:21,227 --> 00:36:24,836
- So you're having dinner afterwards?
- We haven't decided.

368
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:28,011
- What time should I bring her back?
- Shut up.

369
00:36:28,229 --> 00:36:31,403
- See you both later.
- Bonsoir.

370
00:37:21,547 --> 00:37:25,157
You're a very lucky man,
living with two beautiful women.

371
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:30,550
But Gilda still doesn't approve of me.

372
00:37:31,636 --> 00:37:33,724
Sometimes I think she's jealous.

373
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,031
You seem to have a calming influence
on her.

374
00:37:41,422 --> 00:37:45,162
She used to move in wild circles,
but I'm sure you know that.

375
00:37:45,249 --> 00:37:47,728
- And you don't care.
- No, I don't.

376
00:37:47,859 --> 00:37:52,034
Very commendable.
The past and the future are irrelevant.

377
00:37:52,555 --> 00:37:54,860
The moment is everything.

378
00:37:55,947 --> 00:37:59,644
You know, at first I thought
you were an idealist, a bore.

379
00:37:59,687 --> 00:38:01,949
But you're one of us, after all.

380
00:38:46,656 --> 00:38:48,961
Tell me, as one man to another...

381
00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:53,354
what does Gilda like in bed?

382
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:57,051
As one man to another?

383
00:38:57,746 --> 00:38:59,964
That's none of your business.

384
00:39:10,054 --> 00:39:12,185
Come on, Mia. Dance for us.

385
00:39:13,054 --> 00:39:15,881
- Please?
- It's Christmas.

386
00:39:16,577 --> 00:39:18,882
- Come on.
- All right.

387
00:39:19,665 --> 00:39:20,665
Why not?

388
00:40:31,293 --> 00:40:33,597
What are you two talking about?

389
00:40:35,598 --> 00:40:38,295
- You.
- And what are you saying?

390
00:40:41,078 --> 00:40:44,078
What are you saying?

391
00:40:50,211 --> 00:40:53,690
It's past 4:00.
We've almost lost Christmas Day. Come on.

392
00:40:53,777 --> 00:40:55,299
I'm starving.

393
00:41:02,301 --> 00:41:06,606
An American turkey made an ill-starred
bid for freedom at Whipsnade Zoo today...

394
00:41:06,693 --> 00:41:10,695
only to touch down in the
arctic fox enclosure with mixed results.

395
00:41:11,086 --> 00:41:14,304
A happy ending for the fox,
less so for the turkey.

396
00:41:15,087 --> 00:41:16,913
The weather in...

397
00:41:38,397 --> 00:41:40,311
I'm sorry. I don't understand a word.

398
00:41:40,397 --> 00:41:41,789
You don't need to.

399
00:41:42,007 --> 00:41:44,790
If an animal made those sounds,
you'd know it was evil.

400
00:41:44,833 --> 00:41:47,704
All he's saying is that
when Greater Germany is restored...

401
00:41:47,791 --> 00:41:49,922
he'll have no other territorial claims.

402
00:41:49,965 --> 00:41:51,705
And you believe him?

403
00:42:03,491 --> 00:42:07,927
I used to paint pictures of all these places
when I was home from boarding school.

404
00:42:08,013 --> 00:42:10,710
- Can I see them?
- I threw them all away.

405
00:42:11,319 --> 00:42:14,798
I had no talent of my own.
I just wanted to be van Gogh.

406
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,714
- Bonjour, Françoise.
- Bonjour, mademoiselle.

407
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:34,107
What are you doing, Father?

408
00:42:34,804 --> 00:42:37,239
I am saving the lives of insects.

409
00:42:37,935 --> 00:42:40,239
I've never seen you so compassionate.

410
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:43,022
I don't like the popping sounds they make.

411
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:45,414
Why are you wearing your uniform?

412
00:42:45,502 --> 00:42:48,111
There was a rally in Rheims,
the Croix-de-Feu.

413
00:42:48,241 --> 00:42:51,808
Our Popular Front is not
quite so popular here in the country.

414
00:42:51,851 --> 00:42:54,243
The world is veering towards Moscow...

415
00:42:54,331 --> 00:42:57,939
which is a little worrying
for us minor landowners.

416
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:02,114
But politics has never been
one of my daughter's stronger points.

417
00:43:02,157 --> 00:43:03,506
Take your feet off the couch.

418
00:43:03,637 --> 00:43:05,420
- Charles Bessé.
- Guy Malyon.

419
00:43:05,463 --> 00:43:07,247
You'll be joining us for dinner?

420
00:43:12,031 --> 00:43:14,814
Guy recently moved here from England.

421
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:17,945
So, how's the acting?

422
00:43:18,641 --> 00:43:22,338
I only did that one film.
It was never going to be a career.

423
00:43:23,033 --> 00:43:25,251
Whatever next? I can't keep up with her.

424
00:43:25,339 --> 00:43:27,643
First it was dance,
and her room was full of ballet.

425
00:43:27,731 --> 00:43:31,732
Then she discovers Stendhal, and,
of course, she wants to be a great novelist.

426
00:43:31,774 --> 00:43:34,036
And then there was what, painting?

427
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:38,646
One thing I learned from you, Father,
was never to dwell on one's mistakes.

428
00:43:39,038 --> 00:43:42,517
- Where's my stepmother?
- She's probably out walking the dogs.

429
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:48,040
What happened to that Max fellow?

430
00:43:48,344 --> 00:43:50,040
A light of other days.

431
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:54,259
I sired a dilettante,
in every aspect of her life.

432
00:43:54,738 --> 00:43:59,130
That's why I resent you,
for bequeathing me such superficial genes.

433
00:44:29,355 --> 00:44:33,966
They say a winemaker's taste
is the last of his senses to desert him.

434
00:44:34,531 --> 00:44:37,836
But Gilda tells me
that you're not much interested in wine.

435
00:44:37,967 --> 00:44:40,967
- I was brought up on Guinness.
- We drink Guinness in France.

436
00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:43,967
- Very good for an upset stomach.
- The old hair of the dog.

437
00:44:44,055 --> 00:44:45,273
Indeed.

438
00:44:48,665 --> 00:44:52,057
Why, Gilda,
you're looking very fetching tonight.

439
00:44:53,057 --> 00:44:56,450
She likes to startle me
by wearing her mother's things.

440
00:44:56,536 --> 00:44:59,146
I think she intends to make me feel guilty.

441
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:01,973
You see,
she blames me for her mother's death.

442
00:45:02,755 --> 00:45:04,756
I don't blame you, Father.

443
00:45:04,974 --> 00:45:07,452
Fate deals some people a rotten hand,
that's all.

444
00:45:07,495 --> 00:45:11,149
Fate is an excuse for people
who suffer a failure of nerve.

445
00:45:11,671 --> 00:45:14,759
- So it was her fault, was it?
- No, not at all.

446
00:45:14,801 --> 00:45:18,977
It's absolutely and completely my fault.
I am an insensitive brute.

447
00:45:20,673 --> 00:45:23,283
You see, darling? You married a beast.

448
00:45:24,761 --> 00:45:27,544
I married a beast because I'm a huntress.

449
00:45:27,675 --> 00:45:30,763
And if I can't tame you, I'll shoot you.

450
00:45:32,154 --> 00:45:34,676
Then I must mend my ways.

451
00:45:38,156 --> 00:45:41,070
Isn't your birthday coming up soon, dear?

452
00:45:41,548 --> 00:45:44,679
Now, we must do something
to celebrate this year.

453
00:45:45,767 --> 00:45:47,984
You know I never celebrate my birthdays.

454
00:45:48,027 --> 00:45:52,552
If you're afraid of birthdays already,
you'll be a wreck when you're my age.

455
00:45:55,769 --> 00:45:58,378
I can't imagine ever being that old.

456
00:46:00,293 --> 00:46:01,858
Thank you, Gilda.

457
00:46:19,385 --> 00:46:22,993
There's something about that house
that turns me into a monster.

458
00:46:23,036 --> 00:46:26,169
I didn't like his politics,
but I enjoyed the repartee.

459
00:46:26,211 --> 00:46:28,778
He ends up humiliating all his women.

460
00:46:28,821 --> 00:46:31,387
You saw her, how hard she was trying.

461
00:46:32,083 --> 00:46:35,693
All he wants her for
is to show her off to his shooting friends.

462
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:42,782
Mia, we're back.

463
00:46:51,393 --> 00:46:52,871
That bastard.

464
00:47:03,309 --> 00:47:06,570
- You don't have to go to work today.
- I'm all right.

465
00:47:07,702 --> 00:47:09,180
I'm all right.

466
00:47:17,878 --> 00:47:21,401
- Should we tell the police?
- She was a striptease dancer.

467
00:47:22,184 --> 00:47:24,010
They'd say she asked for it.

468
00:47:24,097 --> 00:47:28,011
- Then I'll go round and see him myself.
- And end up in a cell?

469
00:47:28,881 --> 00:47:30,881
He has powerful friends.

470
00:47:32,882 --> 00:47:35,491
Lucien? Gilda Bessé.

471
00:47:37,318 --> 00:47:39,319
Mia doesn't know I'm calling.

472
00:47:39,361 --> 00:47:42,406
She got a little carried away the other night.

473
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:44,320
Yes, that's right.

474
00:47:47,581 --> 00:47:49,495
I like it the way you do.

475
00:47:49,887 --> 00:47:52,800
And I'm stronger than she is.

476
00:47:53,887 --> 00:47:56,496
- I thought we should meet.
- I see.

477
00:47:57,584 --> 00:47:59,020
- Guy?
- Yeah?

478
00:47:59,193 --> 00:48:02,803
Max wants to have lunch today.
He wants to talk about another exhibition.

479
00:48:02,845 --> 00:48:05,195
- Do you mind?
- No, of course not.

480
00:48:05,237 --> 00:48:08,717
You should take Mia to a film or something.
She needs to get out.

481
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:11,022
- That's a good idea.
- Maybe a comedy.

482
00:49:28,825 --> 00:49:30,913
I thought you might change your mind.

483
00:49:31,043 --> 00:49:33,827
My English friend tells me
I'm very stubborn.

484
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:37,523
- I assume he doesn't know where you are?
- No one does.

485
00:49:38,349 --> 00:49:40,741
Perhaps I should lock the door.

486
00:49:48,614 --> 00:49:51,048
Why did you decide to become a nurse?

487
00:49:51,831 --> 00:49:53,832
I wanted to be a dancer.

488
00:49:55,049 --> 00:49:57,833
My father was a coal miner. An anarchist.

489
00:49:59,051 --> 00:50:01,748
Our house was full of politics all the time...

490
00:50:01,834 --> 00:50:04,747
but I would always be running away
to dance.

491
00:50:06,618 --> 00:50:10,532
Two years ago, they declared
a Socialist Republic in Asturias.

492
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:15,447
A house in our street became a hospital.

493
00:50:15,621 --> 00:50:18,534
I tried to help, but I didn't know anything.

494
00:50:18,839 --> 00:50:20,535
And people were...

495
00:50:21,448 --> 00:50:23,057
dying in my arms.

496
00:50:25,232 --> 00:50:27,363
And then the soldiers came.

497
00:50:28,537 --> 00:50:33,233
I tried to stop them from taking my brother,
and that's when they hurt my leg.

498
00:50:34,756 --> 00:50:37,540
After that, I knew I couldn't be a dancer.

499
00:50:39,931 --> 00:50:42,062
And I wanted to help people.

500
00:50:44,846 --> 00:50:47,368
So that's why I am becoming a nurse...

501
00:50:47,411 --> 00:50:50,151
and why I need to go back to my country.

502
00:53:07,578 --> 00:53:09,797
- Hello.
- How did it go?

503
00:53:10,405 --> 00:53:13,798
- It was fine.
- You're doing another exhibition?

504
00:53:14,277 --> 00:53:18,582
We played around with a few different ideas.
I did most of the talking.

505
00:53:19,799 --> 00:53:23,104
Why are you two looking so miserable?
Trois cognacs.

506
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:25,496
We saw a newsreel on Spain.

507
00:53:25,584 --> 00:53:27,671
You were supposed to be cheering her up.

508
00:53:27,802 --> 00:53:28,976
It was my idea.

509
00:53:29,018 --> 00:53:31,977
We wanted to see what else was going on
in the world.

510
00:53:32,193 --> 00:53:34,108
There will always be wars...

511
00:53:34,194 --> 00:53:37,108
while there are people dying to be martyrs.

512
00:53:38,283 --> 00:53:41,110
Go on. Say how guilty you feel.

513
00:53:42,414 --> 00:53:44,893
Afterwards, we sat out in the gardens.

514
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:48,677
I'm serious.
You need to get it out of your system.

515
00:53:48,894 --> 00:53:51,112
Because you feel guilty
that life is good here...

516
00:53:51,199 --> 00:53:53,982
while terrible things are happening there.

517
00:53:54,112 --> 00:53:58,896
After you've talked about it, you'll feel
better because you've shown you care.

518
00:54:00,984 --> 00:54:02,289
To you...

519
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:05,203
for getting rid of that vile man.

520
00:54:06,202 --> 00:54:07,595
And you...

521
00:54:08,594 --> 00:54:10,900
for getting rid of your guilt.

522
00:54:12,204 --> 00:54:13,901
- To us.
- To us.

523
00:54:16,423 --> 00:54:20,206
You live in a cocoon.
You don't think about the world outside.

524
00:54:20,815 --> 00:54:23,511
I give my allegiance to those around me.

525
00:54:23,816 --> 00:54:26,121
We share the world,
whether we like it or not.

526
00:54:26,208 --> 00:54:30,687
You can share my bed as long as you don't
bring your newsreels or newspapers into it.

527
00:54:33,993 --> 00:54:35,297
Marry me.

528
00:54:40,429 --> 00:54:42,125
- What?
- I'm serious.

529
00:54:51,519 --> 00:54:56,216
If I woke one morning
and you'd turned into a husband, I'd flee.

530
00:54:57,129 --> 00:54:58,912
How would it be any different?

531
00:54:58,999 --> 00:55:01,826
Once people get married, they stop trying.

532
00:55:02,609 --> 00:55:06,436
- Anyway, you would want to have children.
- One day.

533
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:12,437
You should have one with Mia.
He'd be beautiful.

534
00:55:13,437 --> 00:55:16,612
Sometimes you say the first thing
that comes into your head.

535
00:55:16,655 --> 00:55:18,700
Should I censor what I say?

536
00:55:18,830 --> 00:55:21,310
If I had a child, I'd have it with you.

537
00:55:21,353 --> 00:55:25,615
My mother was mad. You've met my father.
I have doomed genes.

538
00:55:30,616 --> 00:55:32,529
You talk such nonsense.

539
00:55:58,537 --> 00:56:00,015
What's wrong?

540
00:56:02,625 --> 00:56:07,017
Things are getting worse in Spain.
There are friends of mine there now.

541
00:56:07,235 --> 00:56:10,845
And you want to go get yourself killed, too,
in someone else's war?

542
00:56:10,931 --> 00:56:12,845
It's not someone else's war.

543
00:56:12,932 --> 00:56:15,932
It's as much ours
as if it was happening here.

544
00:56:18,324 --> 00:56:20,542
We all share the same world.

545
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:56,856
Any trained nurses they'll take at once.
I've got an address for you to go to.

546
00:57:03,032 --> 00:57:05,728
Who'll take any trained nurses at once?

547
00:57:08,033 --> 00:57:09,556
I'm going to Spain.

548
00:57:09,642 --> 00:57:12,252
I didn't want to say anything
until it was definite.

549
00:57:12,339 --> 00:57:14,861
And it's time for me to go back, too.

550
00:57:16,644 --> 00:57:18,557
They need nurses there.

551
00:57:20,341 --> 00:57:23,037
We've been living together for a year.

552
00:57:23,473 --> 00:57:27,343
Am I such an ogre that you can't even
discuss your plans with me?

553
00:57:27,474 --> 00:57:28,952
I didn't see much point.

554
00:57:29,039 --> 00:57:33,170
You didn't see much point in talking about
throwing away your life?

555
00:57:34,041 --> 00:57:35,954
And taking Mia with you?

556
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:41,259
I was always going to go back
once I became a nurse.

557
00:57:41,651 --> 00:57:43,739
You would just never listen.

558
00:57:46,957 --> 00:57:50,174
Of course. I should have seen it coming.

559
00:57:51,957 --> 00:57:54,045
You feed each other's guilt.

560
00:57:55,263 --> 00:57:57,046
It's like a disease.

561
00:58:00,482 --> 00:58:02,874
Thank God it hasn't infected me.

562
00:58:23,662 --> 00:58:26,271
Gilda's father was traveling in America...

563
00:58:26,358 --> 00:58:30,359
and as a kind of farewell,
we spent the last week at the Chateau.

564
00:58:31,490 --> 00:58:34,491
The sense of our departure
hung over every moment...

565
00:58:34,578 --> 00:58:38,057
though it was never mentioned again
until the last day.

566
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:48,059
I can't drink any more.

567
00:58:48,886 --> 00:58:50,365
Yes, you can.

568
00:58:53,366 --> 00:58:55,366
We're drinking for all those times...

569
00:58:55,408 --> 00:58:58,192
we won't be able to drink together again.

570
00:59:02,890 --> 00:59:06,586
There'll be periods of leave
when I can come back to Paris.

571
00:59:07,674 --> 00:59:11,892
I wouldn't want to see you
if you came back with some hideous injury.

572
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:15,893
Come on, we're still drinking.
You're not going to sleep.

573
00:59:15,936 --> 00:59:18,067
- Wake up.
- I'm tired.

574
00:59:20,285 --> 00:59:22,068
Gilda, you're drunk.

575
00:59:38,986 --> 00:59:41,291
Why do you have to go as well?

576
01:00:08,516 --> 01:00:09,690
Traitor.

577
01:01:30,103 --> 01:01:31,321
Wait.

578
01:01:38,235 --> 01:01:39,235
Fire!

579
01:02:02,546 --> 01:02:03,720
Forward.

580
01:02:12,939 --> 01:02:15,723
Poor bastards. They didn't stand a chance.

581
01:02:46,731 --> 01:02:48,340
My dear Gilda...

582
01:02:49,037 --> 01:02:52,124
yesterday, in an ambush
behind the enemy lines...

583
01:02:52,646 --> 01:02:55,342
I killed a young Nationalist soldier.

584
01:02:56,125 --> 01:02:58,431
How inadequate those words seem.

585
01:02:59,821 --> 01:03:02,648
He was clutching a locket when he died...

586
01:03:02,736 --> 01:03:05,258
with a photograph of a young woman.

587
01:03:06,432 --> 01:03:10,042
I suppose, as I write this,
she's waiting for news of him...

588
01:03:11,434 --> 01:03:13,739
hoping against hope he is safe.

589
01:03:14,826 --> 01:03:16,435
Dearest Gilda...

590
01:03:17,044 --> 01:03:20,045
still no word from you,
which breaks my heart.

591
01:03:21,131 --> 01:03:24,350
I know that to you all wars are useless...

592
01:03:24,655 --> 01:03:27,656
and for us to risk our lives is a betrayal...

593
01:03:27,830 --> 01:03:29,960
of ourselves and of you.

594
01:03:31,961 --> 01:03:34,048
But my country's a part of me.

595
01:03:34,135 --> 01:03:37,440
And if I was not here,
I would be betraying myself...

596
01:03:37,658 --> 01:03:39,658
and even more, my brother.

597
01:03:40,572 --> 01:03:41,964
Believe me...

598
01:03:42,050 --> 01:03:45,139
my being here does not mean
I love you any less.

599
01:03:46,834 --> 01:03:48,747
Forgive me if you can...

600
01:03:49,052 --> 01:03:51,966
and know that I think of you all the time.

601
01:03:52,966 --> 01:03:55,837
I wonder if you are writing to either of us.

602
01:03:56,358 --> 01:03:59,273
But I do beg you, at least, to write to Guy.

603
01:04:00,142 --> 01:04:02,142
His unit is at Teruel...

604
01:04:02,447 --> 01:04:04,970
where the fighting is especially bitter...

605
01:04:05,057 --> 01:04:07,579
and made worse by the intense cold.

606
01:04:44,675 --> 01:04:48,372
I can't stay.
We're operating in a few moments.

607
01:04:48,459 --> 01:04:49,677
I know.

608
01:04:50,591 --> 01:04:53,374
We treated men from your unit
a few days ago.

609
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:56,853
- That's how I knew you were here.
- I asked about you.

610
01:04:57,853 --> 01:05:00,071
They said you have no nerves.

611
01:05:00,157 --> 01:05:03,593
You're always the quiet one
in the center of the storm.

612
01:05:03,681 --> 01:05:06,986
If I am, it's because I'm too tired
to be frightened.

613
01:05:09,769 --> 01:05:11,857
When do you finish your shift?

614
01:05:11,987 --> 01:05:15,162
We never know. Where are you tonight?

615
01:05:15,683 --> 01:05:18,380
Not far from here. It's an old tannery.

616
01:05:18,772 --> 01:05:20,076
I know it.

617
01:05:21,468 --> 01:05:23,164
If I can, I'll come.

618
01:06:29,181 --> 01:06:33,313
- You must be dead on your feet.
- No. I have a secret weapon.

619
01:06:35,705 --> 01:06:39,880
It's strong enough to help you forget
what you've seen during the day.

620
01:06:54,188 --> 01:06:56,188
Have you heard from her?

621
01:06:59,102 --> 01:07:01,885
I've had other letters, but none from her.

622
01:07:03,799 --> 01:07:05,017
And you?

623
01:07:06,626 --> 01:07:07,627
No.

624
01:07:08,713 --> 01:07:10,410
Why won't she write?

625
01:07:15,194 --> 01:07:18,020
She loves you more than she'll ever admit.

626
01:07:18,716 --> 01:07:21,891
And one day you'll be together again,
I know it.

627
01:07:27,414 --> 01:07:31,719
These last few days, I've been asking myself
if any of this is worth it.

628
01:07:31,762 --> 01:07:35,503
Perhaps she was right.
The world should be left to look after itself.

629
01:07:35,634 --> 01:07:39,026
- You know you don't believe that.
- But what are we achieving?

630
01:07:39,113 --> 01:07:42,722
With the Germans and the Italians
on their side, it's only a matter of time.

631
01:07:42,810 --> 01:07:47,724
In that time, maybe the rest of the world
will begin to realize what's happening.

632
01:07:51,029 --> 01:07:53,812
- You were always the sensible one.
- Was I?

633
01:07:54,421 --> 01:07:56,813
Not in my choice of men, remember?

634
01:08:03,032 --> 01:08:04,903
We should try to sleep.

635
01:08:24,646 --> 01:08:27,908
You know, Gilda once said
we two should have a child.

636
01:08:30,735 --> 01:08:33,127
You know she and I were lovers?

637
01:08:35,911 --> 01:08:37,650
I knew underneath.

638
01:08:40,433 --> 01:08:44,347
I wanted to tell you,
but she always said you were too British.

639
01:08:49,218 --> 01:08:51,132
She was probably right.

640
01:08:58,351 --> 01:09:01,221
Those were the happiest times of my life...

641
01:09:01,439 --> 01:09:03,439
the three of us together.

642
01:09:06,136 --> 01:09:08,137
And you and I came here.

643
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:11,529
We had no choice.

644
01:09:15,225 --> 01:09:17,226
How can I be so tired...

645
01:09:17,661 --> 01:09:19,530
and still feel jealous?

646
01:09:23,662 --> 01:09:26,141
I was jealous of you all the time.

647
01:09:48,755 --> 01:09:50,452
She'd be pleased.

648
01:09:52,539 --> 01:09:54,844
Everything needs her blessing.

649
01:10:16,458 --> 01:10:19,677
- Here's your lift.
- My doctor friend.

650
01:10:20,765 --> 01:10:25,070
He's convinced I'm some kind of saint
because I never go with anyone.

651
01:10:25,461 --> 01:10:28,375
He was so relieved when I said
I wanted to come and see you.

652
01:10:28,418 --> 01:10:31,158
He insisted on giving me a lift himself.

653
01:10:32,072 --> 01:10:34,246
I finally got rid of my halo.

654
01:11:42,090 --> 01:11:44,091
There is no second sight.

655
01:11:45,483 --> 01:11:47,961
We grope towards our future blind.

656
01:11:48,961 --> 01:11:50,788
It's kinder that way.

657
01:11:52,571 --> 01:11:56,485
On the morning of her final day,
she came to her death clear-eyed...

658
01:11:56,572 --> 01:11:59,268
brave, unknowing.

659
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:04,183
And when the snow melts, spring has come.

660
01:12:05,487 --> 01:12:07,401
There is an end to war.

661
01:12:10,793 --> 01:12:12,489
One small flower...

662
01:12:13,098 --> 01:12:15,273
blessed, unique...

663
01:12:17,795 --> 01:12:19,491
will flower no more.

664
01:13:24,291 --> 01:13:25,595
Gilda...

665
01:13:26,422 --> 01:13:29,510
I have to tell you
that our dear friend is dead.

666
01:13:31,118 --> 01:13:33,510
I saw her just before it happened.

667
01:13:33,989 --> 01:13:35,902
She was so beautiful...

668
01:13:35,989 --> 01:13:37,729
and had become so wise.

669
01:13:37,990 --> 01:13:39,817
Far stronger than me.

670
01:14:38,006 --> 01:14:42,224
A few months later, as the forces
of the Republic began to disintegrate...

671
01:14:42,267 --> 01:14:45,834
I crossed back into France
with the remnants of my unit.

672
01:14:46,443 --> 01:14:48,921
All our efforts had come to nothing.

673
01:14:49,922 --> 01:14:52,010
The war in Spain was lost.

674
01:16:34,254 --> 01:16:37,776
I am speaking to you
from the Cabinet Room...

675
01:16:38,559 --> 01:16:40,255
at 10 Downing Street.

676
01:16:41,778 --> 01:16:45,344
This morning,
the British Ambassador in Berlin...

677
01:16:45,953 --> 01:16:49,562
handed the German government
a final note...

678
01:16:50,475 --> 01:16:55,042
stating that unless we heard from them
by 11:00...

679
01:16:55,956 --> 01:17:00,565
that they were prepared at once
to withdraw their troops from Poland...

680
01:17:01,043 --> 01:17:03,957
a state of war would exist between us.

681
01:17:06,175 --> 01:17:08,176
I have to tell you now...

682
01:17:08,349 --> 01:17:11,350
that no such undertaking
has been received...

683
01:17:12,177 --> 01:17:13,872
and that consequently...

684
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:17,352
this country is at war with Germany.

685
01:17:20,483 --> 01:17:23,875
The war against the Fascists in Spain
was only a rehearsal.

686
01:17:24,354 --> 01:17:27,050
The greater struggle was about to begin.

687
01:17:34,574 --> 01:17:36,183
Less than a year later...

688
01:17:36,226 --> 01:17:39,966
Poland, Norway, Holland, Belgium,
and France were overrun...

689
01:17:40,489 --> 01:17:42,794
and the Germans entered Paris.

690
01:17:47,577 --> 01:17:50,187
I doubted I would ever see her again.

691
01:17:55,188 --> 01:17:57,972
My war was in the field of intelligence.

692
01:17:58,014 --> 01:17:59,972
And early in 1944...

693
01:18:00,059 --> 01:18:02,886
I was sent to establish links
with Resistance fighters...

694
01:18:02,973 --> 01:18:05,669
based in the countryside near La Manche.

695
01:18:11,888 --> 01:18:14,976
In the late spring, I was transferred to Paris.

696
01:18:15,802 --> 01:18:18,977
Six long years had passed
since I was last there.

697
01:18:48,507 --> 01:18:52,682
My cover was as an official working
for a firm manufacturing rolling stock...

698
01:18:52,812 --> 01:18:55,290
for the hard-pressed French railways.

699
01:18:55,508 --> 01:18:59,292
And some time after I arrived,
I was waiting for a rendezvous.

700
01:19:53,001 --> 01:19:56,002
Did she see me? I wasn't sure.

701
01:19:57,090 --> 01:20:00,526
But after the initial shock,
how could I be surprised?

702
01:20:00,700 --> 01:20:03,004
Gilda didn't see the world as others did.

703
01:20:03,092 --> 01:20:04,831
She was looking after herself...

704
01:20:04,917 --> 01:20:07,918
making sure she could live
in the style she was accustomed to.

705
01:21:26,418 --> 01:21:27,548
Bravo.

706
01:23:13,880 --> 01:23:14,968
Stop!

707
01:24:07,764 --> 01:24:10,461
Three mornings I sat across the road
waiting for you.

708
01:24:10,504 --> 01:24:11,896
You mustn't come again.

709
01:24:11,983 --> 01:24:15,157
He could come here at any time,
and everyone watches.

710
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:17,289
They'll have seen you
come into the building...

711
01:24:17,376 --> 01:24:19,289
the patron and his wife from the café.

712
01:24:19,332 --> 01:24:22,072
Yeah, well, they don't think
much of you there.

713
01:24:22,160 --> 01:24:24,682
- Of course not.
- And you don't care?

714
01:24:25,899 --> 01:24:28,683
Did I ever care what people thought of me?

715
01:24:29,074 --> 01:24:32,466
I'd like to believe that
once you cared what I thought.

716
01:24:34,598 --> 01:24:37,685
Why, Gilda? Why this?

717
01:24:41,991 --> 01:24:44,774
I never much liked my own company,
you know that.

718
01:24:44,905 --> 01:24:46,992
Yeah, but with one of them?

719
01:24:47,079 --> 01:24:48,775
It's just a game.

720
01:24:49,384 --> 01:24:50,689
Not now.

721
01:24:52,776 --> 01:24:54,689
I'm glad you're alive.

722
01:24:57,386 --> 01:24:59,082
You know about Mia?

723
01:25:04,606 --> 01:25:06,606
She loved you, you know?

724
01:25:08,085 --> 01:25:09,694
As much as I did.

725
01:25:11,477 --> 01:25:12,999
You should go.

726
01:25:13,999 --> 01:25:15,391
We could leave Paris.

727
01:25:15,478 --> 01:25:17,783
Make our way to the coast.
I have the papers.

728
01:25:17,826 --> 01:25:19,479
Don't be absurd.

729
01:25:21,175 --> 01:25:24,002
Are you in love with him? This German?

730
01:25:28,177 --> 01:25:30,395
Or is it just a convenience?

731
01:25:31,090 --> 01:25:33,091
A business arrangement, like with Max?

732
01:25:33,178 --> 01:25:37,006
For the duration of the exhibition?
The duration of the war?

733
01:25:37,701 --> 01:25:39,484
Go out the back way.

734
01:25:40,919 --> 01:25:45,182
When we were making love just then,
you felt it as strongly as I did.

735
01:25:50,705 --> 01:25:51,791
Yes.

736
01:25:54,706 --> 01:25:57,402
Our bodies were always good together.

737
01:26:08,100 --> 01:26:10,101
Forget about me, Guy...

738
01:26:12,189 --> 01:26:13,711
as I have you.

739
01:26:17,799 --> 01:26:19,800
You're out of my life now.

740
01:26:51,329 --> 01:26:52,635
Hello, sir.

741
01:26:52,721 --> 01:26:56,201
When they told me you'd been sitting
at a café three mornings in a row...

742
01:26:56,243 --> 01:26:57,331
I didn't believe them.

743
01:26:57,417 --> 01:27:00,506
Now I find it's because
you were waiting to see an old girlfriend.

744
01:27:00,636 --> 01:27:04,419
A girlfriend who happens to be
hobnobbing with a German officer.

745
01:27:04,462 --> 01:27:09,030
Do you realize the risk you're taking?
The risk you're taking with all of us here?

746
01:27:20,033 --> 01:27:22,511
You're lucky you didn't
wake up with your throat cut.

747
01:27:22,642 --> 01:27:25,034
Did you know she was involved
with a German?

748
01:27:25,121 --> 01:27:26,208
Yes, sir.

749
01:27:26,250 --> 01:27:30,122
- And yet you still went to see her?
- I've known her a long time.

750
01:27:30,210 --> 01:27:32,210
I've a good mind
to have London pull you out.

751
01:27:32,252 --> 01:27:35,428
They won't have it, because there's no one
with your credentials...

752
01:27:35,515 --> 01:27:36,950
can come in at this short notice.

753
01:27:37,037 --> 01:27:40,952
- I won't be seeing her again.
- lf you do, I'll kill you myself.

754
01:28:13,960 --> 01:28:15,743
You're so beautiful.

755
01:28:18,135 --> 01:28:20,136
It was the right size, yes?

756
01:28:21,049 --> 01:28:22,832
I feel very special.

757
01:28:31,529 --> 01:28:34,052
One day, I will get you stockings.

758
01:28:34,139 --> 01:28:37,140
- When the war is over.
- When the war is over.

759
01:28:55,666 --> 01:28:58,971
I want to speak your language.
You promised you'd teach me.

760
01:28:59,059 --> 01:29:02,669
But we have our own private language,
you and I.

761
01:29:03,973 --> 01:29:06,147
And when the Allies win the war...

762
01:29:06,235 --> 01:29:09,148
we'll all be speaking English in our sleep.

763
01:29:10,670 --> 01:29:14,541
To think, if I had been at Cambridge
one year later...

764
01:29:15,236 --> 01:29:17,150
we might have met then.

765
01:29:19,977 --> 01:29:21,847
Here we go again.

766
01:29:24,544 --> 01:29:27,066
You seem a little far away tonight.

767
01:29:30,371 --> 01:29:31,676
I'm here.

768
01:30:20,776 --> 01:30:23,168
I wonder who's getting it tonight.

769
01:30:25,864 --> 01:30:28,082
You were good at the meeting.

770
01:30:28,561 --> 01:30:30,474
You got it just right.

771
01:30:34,780 --> 01:30:37,172
I'm sorry I followed you that day.

772
01:30:38,172 --> 01:30:40,172
No, you had every reason.

773
01:30:45,478 --> 01:30:48,088
I know what it's like to love someone.

774
01:30:51,480 --> 01:30:52,872
Thank you.

775
01:31:34,795 --> 01:31:36,578
Why do you let them insult you?

776
01:31:36,709 --> 01:31:39,188
If our roles were reversed
and this was Berlin...

777
01:31:39,230 --> 01:31:41,275
you'd find yourself doing the same.

778
01:31:41,406 --> 01:31:43,493
And expect to be punished.

779
01:31:47,886 --> 01:31:49,712
I'm angry because...

780
01:31:55,888 --> 01:31:59,280
I don't want anything to spoil tonight
of all nights.

781
01:31:59,410 --> 01:32:01,715
- Why tonight?
- Because...

782
01:32:06,412 --> 01:32:08,499
Because it's your birthday.

783
01:32:10,718 --> 01:32:13,023
You've always refused to tell me,
my darling.

784
01:32:13,110 --> 01:32:15,806
And I know it's a woman's prerogative...

785
01:32:16,719 --> 01:32:19,590
but I wanted to know so we could celebrate.

786
01:32:20,024 --> 01:32:23,286
Forgive me, I checked your papers.

787
01:32:26,722 --> 01:32:28,723
My puppet, you're upset?

788
01:32:30,288 --> 01:32:32,593
But why? Thirty-three.

789
01:32:34,289 --> 01:32:37,290
I thought 28 at most.

790
01:32:38,291 --> 01:32:40,813
Open it. Please?

791
01:32:56,425 --> 01:32:58,208
So we're on standby.

792
01:34:52,065 --> 01:34:55,543
Go down to the lavatories
and put on the clothes there...

793
01:34:59,762 --> 01:35:00,936
my love.

794
01:35:18,768 --> 01:35:21,246
They picked up the man
you were meeting, Bisquet.

795
01:35:21,333 --> 01:35:22,769
How did you...

796
01:35:23,247 --> 01:35:26,769
There's a bicycle outside.
You have about two minutes.

797
01:35:31,249 --> 01:35:34,250
Remember Cambridge? The next morning?

798
01:35:34,945 --> 01:35:37,337
- How I dressed like a boy?
- Gilda.

799
01:35:46,645 --> 01:35:48,949
I had no idea it would be you.

800
01:36:03,649 --> 01:36:05,475
Give me 30 seconds.

801
01:37:24,583 --> 01:37:27,496
- What happened?
- Bisquet was picked up last night.

802
01:37:27,584 --> 01:37:28,888
We just found out.

803
01:37:28,975 --> 01:37:31,976
- Who tipped you off?
- The woman I went to see.

804
01:37:59,810 --> 01:38:02,897
This is a surprise.
I thought you were on alert.

805
01:38:04,506 --> 01:38:07,986
We've been stood down.
There's a storm in the Channel.

806
01:38:08,681 --> 01:38:10,899
No invasion in this weather.

807
01:38:12,205 --> 01:38:13,900
How was your day?

808
01:38:14,988 --> 01:38:17,814
Puzzling. Frustrating.

809
01:38:20,293 --> 01:38:21,903
But not anymore.

810
01:38:24,598 --> 01:38:28,687
I was elated. In some way, somehow,
she was on our side.

811
01:38:30,383 --> 01:38:33,297
Before I could even think
of finding a way to see her...

812
01:38:33,384 --> 01:38:35,993
events on a greater stage overtook us:

813
01:38:36,515 --> 01:38:37,690
D-day.

814
01:43:55,208 --> 01:43:57,599
For a few days I was looked after
by the priest.

815
01:43:58,905 --> 01:44:01,992
And then I was flown back
to hospital in England.

816
01:44:02,079 --> 01:44:06,211
I still had no clear idea
of Gilda's involvement in the Resistance.

817
01:44:06,689 --> 01:44:09,212
All I knew was that in spite of everything...

818
01:44:09,298 --> 01:44:12,604
when the war was over,
we would be together again...

819
01:44:12,690 --> 01:44:14,604
as Mia had foretold.

820
01:44:15,474 --> 01:44:17,909
The Major will see you now, sir.

821
01:44:21,606 --> 01:44:24,085
Just wait here for a moment, please.

822
01:44:33,609 --> 01:44:36,088
- Long time, Guy.
- It is, sir.

823
01:44:38,089 --> 01:44:42,220
The first contact didn't come from our side.
She approached us.

824
01:44:42,612 --> 01:44:46,308
In fact, it was more than a year
before I discovered who she was.

825
01:44:46,351 --> 01:44:48,613
When I realized it was Gilda...

826
01:44:48,700 --> 01:44:51,483
I was as surprised as I'm sure you were.

827
01:44:52,701 --> 01:44:56,223
Although I suppose you knew her
better than I ever did.

828
01:45:00,921 --> 01:45:03,922
Her first lover
worked in Stülpnagel's offices.

829
01:45:03,964 --> 01:45:07,096
She copied documents from his briefcase
with a miniature camera.

830
01:45:07,227 --> 01:45:08,618
She's good with cameras.

831
01:45:08,661 --> 01:45:11,402
Then passed them on through her contact
in a beauty salon.

832
01:45:11,445 --> 01:45:14,620
The intelligence officer she's with now
is much more circumspect.

833
01:45:14,706 --> 01:45:17,098
But one tip-off she gave us...

834
01:45:17,230 --> 01:45:20,317
saved an entire escape line from infiltration.

835
01:45:20,404 --> 01:45:23,796
And when you went to see her,
you were putting all that at risk.

836
01:45:23,838 --> 01:45:25,927
Why didn't she tell me?

837
01:45:26,101 --> 01:45:29,319
You know why.
If you were caught and tortured...

838
01:45:32,712 --> 01:45:35,104
It wasn't just for your own good.

839
01:45:36,234 --> 01:45:37,800
Paris is in chaos.

840
01:45:37,931 --> 01:45:40,800
The Resistance is trying
to liberate the city themselves...

841
01:45:40,932 --> 01:45:44,498
and there's no possible justification
for sending you back there.

842
01:45:44,628 --> 01:45:47,499
But she is very resourceful,
as we both know.

843
01:45:47,803 --> 01:45:49,803
I wouldn't worry about her too much.

844
01:45:49,846 --> 01:45:52,499
It's not the Germans I'm worried about.

845
01:45:54,239 --> 01:45:57,414
Of course, if you were to go
of your own accord...

846
01:45:58,327 --> 01:46:00,501
I wouldn't do anything to stop you.

847
01:47:17,826 --> 01:47:20,131
- You got my message?
- I'm not coming with you.

848
01:47:20,262 --> 01:47:22,132
Have you seen the people out there?

849
01:47:22,174 --> 01:47:24,741
I'll be all right if I stay here.
When the Allies come...

850
01:47:24,783 --> 01:47:28,350
Why will you not come with me?
I can take you to Germany.

851
01:47:28,829 --> 01:47:32,265
I know it won't be easy,
but at least you'll be safe.

852
01:47:33,352 --> 01:47:35,352
I don't love you, Frans.

853
01:47:43,528 --> 01:47:44,834
Oh, God!

854
01:47:55,053 --> 01:47:55,967
No!

855
01:49:12,987 --> 01:49:17,162
Well, my love,
I'm trying to make sense of things...

856
01:49:17,988 --> 01:49:21,380
of how I was, and how I am now.

857
01:53:46,059 --> 01:53:49,625
Well, my love,
I'm trying to make sense of things...

858
01:53:50,365 --> 01:53:53,757
of how I was, and how I am now.

859
01:53:56,844 --> 01:54:00,367
I have always believed
our first duty is to ourselves...

860
01:54:00,454 --> 01:54:02,455
to live life to the full.

861
01:54:04,150 --> 01:54:07,542
But I have also been haunted
by another conviction...

862
01:54:07,630 --> 01:54:11,457
that everything is preordained,
lying in wait...

863
01:54:12,457 --> 01:54:14,458
and time is running out.

864
01:54:15,850 --> 01:54:20,241
I seem to have charged through my life
in a kind of panic.

865
01:54:21,155 --> 01:54:22,373
And looking back...

866
01:54:22,459 --> 01:54:26,157
I feel I have achieved little of worth
beyond our friendship:

867
01:54:26,243 --> 01:54:28,940
yours and mine, and Mia's.

868
01:54:31,549 --> 01:54:33,463
Then one day I woke...

869
01:54:34,245 --> 01:54:37,638
and found I had lost
the two people I cared for most.

870
01:54:39,551 --> 01:54:44,161
Only then did I begin to realize that
we cannot live alone, aloof from the world...

871
01:54:44,857 --> 01:54:49,250
and that to believe we cannot fight
against fate is an act of surrender.

872
01:54:51,076 --> 01:54:55,468
You were right when you said that
once I cared for your opinion of me...

873
01:54:56,642 --> 01:54:59,557
but wrong in thinking I ever stopped caring.

874
01:55:02,775 --> 01:55:04,079
I love you.

875
01:55:05,079 --> 01:55:15,079
