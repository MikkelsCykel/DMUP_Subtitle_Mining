00:02:45,798 --> 00:02:48,733
- Is that for us?
- No, it's for you.

2
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,769
- What is that?
- A mantrap.

3
00:02:50,902 --> 00:02:53,805
They used to use it
for catching poachers.

4
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:55,568
Hello, Amy.

5
00:02:55,706 --> 00:02:58,074
- Hello, Charlie.
- Where do we put it, Mr. Sumner?

6
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:01,236
- Oh. Here in the back.
- Oh, it's heavy, Mr. Sumner.

7
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:04,212
I'm surprised
you still remember me.

8
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:06,217
Where do we put it, Amy?

9
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:09,218
Anywhere you want.
It's your birthday present.

10
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:11,847
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

11
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:14,389
- Don't scratch it.
- Why are you surprised?

12
00:03:14,492 --> 00:03:17,586
- How long has it been, Charlie?
- Three summer holidays in six years.

13
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:22,599
David, this is an old
friend of mine, Charlie Venner.

14
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,602
My husband, David Sumner.

15
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,604
- Mr. Venner.
- Please call me Charlie.

16
00:03:26,705 --> 00:03:28,968
You work around here?

17
00:03:29,074 --> 00:03:30,804
Sometimes.

18
00:03:30,943 --> 00:03:33,342
- Will you give me a hand, please?
- Yeah.

19
00:03:33,444 --> 00:03:35,846
- David's a mathematician.
- What are you going to catch?

20
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:38,543
- Peace and quiet.
- Oh, an arithmetic teacher.

21
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:40,084
- Well, uh-
- No.

22
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:42,086
He's writing a book...

23
00:03:42,187 --> 00:03:44,883
on the computer analysis
of the celestial-

24
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:47,752
Good try. Here, why don't you
put this in the trunk, Amy.

25
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,758
Let me.

26
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:58,567
Maybe, um, Charlie could
help us with the garage, David.

27
00:03:58,669 --> 00:04:01,264
Yeah, that's a good idea.
This fellow Norman, uh-

28
00:04:01,372 --> 00:04:03,568
- Scutt.
- Yes.

29
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:08,236
- He's, uh, taking forever.
- Me and Bobby'll do it
for you, Mr. Sumner.

30
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:11,680
Me and my cousin Bertie will be out
tomorrow. We'll get it up for you.

31
00:04:11,782 --> 00:04:13,682
Yes? How much?

32
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:17,244
- Oh, reasonable.
- Okay, thank you.

33
00:04:17,389 --> 00:04:19,653
- We're at-
- Back at Trencher's farm.

34
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,624
We'll be there, sir.

35
00:04:22,894 --> 00:04:24,794
Good. Good.

36
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:33,036
Where are you going?

37
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:34,730
David?

38
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:37,502
- Where are you going?
- Cigarettes.

39
00:04:39,111 --> 00:04:41,774
Okay.

40
00:04:45,516 --> 00:04:48,918
Uh, a couple of packs of
any American cigarettes, please.

41
00:04:49,021 --> 00:04:51,422
- Time, gentlemen, please.

42
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:53,992
Finish your drinkin', gentlemen.
Let me have your glasses.

43
00:05:09,408 --> 00:05:11,309
Henry Niles.

44
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:13,845
I thought he was to be put away.

45
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:17,608
Oh, we can take care
of our own here. Usually do.

46
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:27,218
Remember when
I took care of you, Amy?

47
00:05:34,132 --> 00:05:36,930
But you didn't.
Remember?

48
00:05:39,204 --> 00:05:42,470
There was once a time,
Mrs. Sumner...

49
00:05:42,574 --> 00:05:46,011
when you were ready
to beg me for it.

50
00:05:46,144 --> 00:05:48,045
Take your hands off me.

51
00:06:10,235 --> 00:06:13,137
Come on, gentlemen. Drink up.
Let me have your glasses, please.

52
00:06:13,237 --> 00:06:15,206
Bloody early, Harry.

53
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,475
Harry...

54
00:06:23,615 --> 00:06:26,483
I think I should have another pint.

55
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:36,593
Sorry about my uncle, Harry.

56
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:38,596
I think he's a bit taken with drink.

57
00:06:38,697 --> 00:06:40,632
Oh.

58
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:43,963
I do beg your pardon,
Mr. Harry Ware.

59
00:06:44,069 --> 00:06:48,233
- I'll pay for
the American gentlemen's cigarettes.
- Oh, no, that's okay, l-

60
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:51,002
That's all right.
I got it, sir.

61
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:53,009
Garage coming along?

62
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:55,011
Norman fixing it up all right?

63
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:56,877
Yeah.

64
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:01,949
And I'll pay for the glass.

65
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:05,716
And I'll even pay for the little bit of
plaster to put on your bleedin' finger.

66
00:07:05,891 --> 00:07:10,088
But I do think I should have
another pint to take me home.

67
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:12,562
The bar's closed, Tom.

68
00:07:12,697 --> 00:07:14,598
- Come on, Tom.
- Oh.

69
00:07:14,733 --> 00:07:17,259
It is, is it?

70
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,701
We'll see about that.!

71
00:07:19,838 --> 00:07:23,206
- Take it easy, old man!
- Old man, you say?

72
00:07:44,262 --> 00:07:46,197
All right, Tom.

73
00:07:46,264 --> 00:07:48,096
You've had your fun.

74
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:50,100
Pay the man and leave.

75
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,269
Ah.

76
00:07:56,608 --> 00:07:59,372
Oh.

77
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:02,639
I do beg your pardon,
Mr. Magistrate.

78
00:08:06,951 --> 00:08:09,649
But what I am, I am.

79
00:08:09,754 --> 00:08:11,689
What's the damage, Harry?

80
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:13,384
Call it a quid, Tom.

81
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:15,925
Let's call it, uh...

82
00:08:16,028 --> 00:08:17,927
30 bob.

83
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:22,634
Will that do then, eh, Major?

84
00:08:22,701 --> 00:08:24,636
Go home, Tom, will you...

85
00:08:24,802 --> 00:08:27,237
or you'll be up before me
on a fresh charge.

86
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,708
Come on, lads.
Work to be done.

87
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:40,783
- See you tonight, Harry.
- All right, Tom.

88
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,759
I showed him, eh, lads?

89
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,500
Uh, they're paid for, sir.

90
00:08:59,403 --> 00:09:01,269
They are now.

91
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:27,791
- Stupid cow!
- Get off!

92
00:09:27,966 --> 00:09:30,629
What was that about?

93
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,475
Who was that big guy
with the beard?

94
00:09:38,576 --> 00:09:41,138
Why?

95
00:09:41,245 --> 00:09:44,148
Is he any relation
to your friend Charlie?

96
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,149
Yes.

97
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:07,336
How well do you know
this fellow Venner?

98
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,639
Stop teasing.

99
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:13,109
- Did you ever go out with him?
- Stop.

100
00:10:13,211 --> 00:10:15,610
- Hmm?
- Leave me alone! Stop it!

101
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:18,115
- Stop.

102
00:10:18,216 --> 00:10:20,115
- Tell me.
- I'll stop the car.

103
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:22,413
I just want to know.
Tell me.

104
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:25,254
Stop. I'm telling you.

105
00:10:25,356 --> 00:10:27,883
- You asked for it.
- Okay.

106
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:29,927
All right, drive the car- Ooh!

107
00:10:30,028 --> 00:10:31,826
- Ooh! Ooh!

108
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:33,796
You asked for it!
Chicken!

109
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:36,730
- You're nuts!
- You're terrible! You're wicked!

110
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:40,567
- Oh, by the way-

111
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:43,231
- Yeah?
- Venner did try to get fresh once.

112
00:10:43,341 --> 00:10:45,831
Yeah? So?

113
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:49,447
Nothing happened.!
- Ba-bum

114
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:52,947
Ba-ba-bah-bum
Ba-ba, ba-bum

115
00:11:19,778 --> 00:11:21,677
Hi.

116
00:11:24,081 --> 00:11:25,981
You'll have some help tomorrow.

117
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:31,283
Charles Venner and his cousin
are coming to help finish the garage.

118
00:11:31,423 --> 00:11:33,947
We'll have the garage finished
before Chris gets the rats out.

119
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:36,923
- Hello, miss.
- Chris?

120
00:11:37,028 --> 00:11:38,690
Yeah, Chris.

121
00:11:40,197 --> 00:11:43,691
Oh, yes. Mr. Cawsey.
The rat man.

122
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:45,735
- Want help with this, sir?
- Yes.

123
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:49,503
It's a real antique, sir.

124
00:11:49,606 --> 00:11:52,907
- Rare, they are.
- My wife is a collector.

125
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:54,912
But I end up with them.

126
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:57,913
I find it's a bit large
for my prey, sir.

127
00:11:58,017 --> 00:12:00,008
- Won't do at all.
- Don't count on it.

128
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:02,245
- Do you like it here, sir?
- Very much.

129
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:05,254
- I hear it's pretty rough
in the States, sir.

130
00:12:05,355 --> 00:12:07,255
Have you seen some of it, sir?

131
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:10,157
Bombin', riotin', snipin',
shootin' the blacks?

132
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,162
Can't walk down the streets, they say.

133
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:15,197
Was you involved in it, sir?
I mean, did you take part?

134
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:16,961
See anybody get knifed?

135
00:12:17,067 --> 00:12:19,503
Just between commercials.

136
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,173
Wanna put that down there?

137
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:28,677
No, I'm just glad I'm here
where it's, uh, quiet...

138
00:12:28,812 --> 00:12:33,909
and you can breathe fresh air
and drink water that doesn't
have to come out of a bottle.

139
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:37,182
It isn't water that I drink
out of a bottle, sir.

140
00:12:41,158 --> 00:12:44,220
Those two fellows will be up
to help you tomorrow.

141
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:58,774
- You gonna have a crack at her, Norman?
- No.

142
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:01,210
Ten months inside
is enough for me.

143
00:13:02,447 --> 00:13:04,745
- They got anything worth taking?
- Nope.

144
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:08,918
Except, uh...

145
00:13:09,019 --> 00:13:11,421
these.

146
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:13,423
- You bloody fool.
- It was nothing.

147
00:13:13,524 --> 00:13:15,754
She's got a dozen or more.

148
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:18,760
Full of perfume.

149
00:13:20,697 --> 00:13:22,599
You like my trophy?

150
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:24,600
Bugger your trophy.

151
00:13:24,701 --> 00:13:27,101
I want what was in 'em.

152
00:13:30,707 --> 00:13:33,610
I could do with
some of that too, Normie.

153
00:13:35,379 --> 00:13:37,279
Charlie Venner.

154
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:39,783
He had some of it years ago...

155
00:13:39,884 --> 00:13:41,851
when she was here with her father.

156
00:13:41,985 --> 00:13:43,885
Venner's a bloody liar...

157
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:45,889
and so are you.

158
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,721
Tell her, smell her
Lock her in the cellar

159
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:54,798
Kitty, kitty.
Where are you?

160
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,067
Kitty.

161
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,139
Kitty, kitty.

162
00:14:05,677 --> 00:14:07,441
Kitty, kitty.

163
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:10,048
Kitty, kitty, kitty.

164
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:12,707
Want a drink?

165
00:14:12,817 --> 00:14:14,807
I can't find the cat.

166
00:14:14,952 --> 00:14:16,854
Doesn't answer my call.

167
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:20,514
Do I?

168
00:14:20,658 --> 00:14:22,557
You'd better.

169
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:34,769
Why did you hire
Charlie Venner?

170
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:39,009
I didn't. You did.

171
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:41,009
Kitty.

172
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:43,513
If she's in my study,
I'll kill her.

173
00:14:49,086 --> 00:14:50,988
What?

174
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:54,024
Nothing.

175
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,379
That your daddy's chair?

176
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,985
Every chair is my daddy's chair.

177
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:38,832
I'm glad we came.

178
00:15:44,743 --> 00:15:46,802
- What are you doing?
- Kiss me.

179
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,176
Mmm.

180
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:53,682
- You're an animal.
- Mm-mmm.

181
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:03,081
Why'd you take my heater
out of the study?

182
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,754
Because it's going upstairs.

183
00:16:07,899 --> 00:16:09,798
What happened?

184
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:16,072
It's not going upstairs.

185
00:16:16,173 --> 00:16:17,937
It's freezing in there.

186
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,576
Hello.

187
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:31,120
I can see you're working at top speed.

188
00:16:31,221 --> 00:16:34,019
Is he in there studying?

189
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:38,562
- You'd better do something.

190
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:41,630
- My husband will think
all Englishmen are lazy.
- Let me help.

191
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:44,360
Hey!

192
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:59,447
Yeah, come on over here. This way.

193
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:02,543
Watch your fingers, Chris.

194
00:17:11,695 --> 00:17:14,063
What was so funny with them?

195
00:17:16,534 --> 00:17:19,230
They just think
you're strange.

196
00:17:21,271 --> 00:17:23,206
Why, because I'm American?

197
00:17:24,741 --> 00:17:27,175
Mmm, no. No.

198
00:17:27,311 --> 00:17:29,403
Just strange.

199
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:34,983
Do you think I'm strange?

200
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:38,618
Occasionally.

201
00:17:41,358 --> 00:17:43,759
You act like you're 14.

202
00:17:46,096 --> 00:17:48,030
I am.

203
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:51,066
Wanna try for 12?

204
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:56,531
How about eight?
I freak out for eight-year-olds.

205
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:11,114
- David?
- Huh?

206
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,622
Will you please
get some lettuce?

207
00:18:15,259 --> 00:18:17,125
Okay.

208
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:21,762
Oh, and fix
the damned toaster.

209
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:35,010
What does she think
I'm doing here, playing games?

210
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,012
What is this,
grammar school?

211
00:18:37,115 --> 00:18:39,016
Jesus Christ.

212
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,828
Uh, we're leavin' now,
Mr. Sumner.

213
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:56,833
- Mr. Riddaway be givin' us a lift.
- Fine.

214
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:00,635
Oh, I was just sayin'
to your missus...

215
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:04,537
that in a funny sort of way I feel
closer to rats than I do to people.

216
00:19:04,674 --> 00:19:08,076
Even though I kill 'em for a living.
Their dying is my living.

217
00:19:11,615 --> 00:19:14,814
Smell a rat, see a rat, kill a rat.
That's me, Chris Cawsey.

218
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:18,319
I'd be lost without 'em.
It's true. I tell you straight.

219
00:19:18,423 --> 00:19:21,356
Cleverest thing you ever see
around these parts is a rat.

220
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:23,893
Rats is life!

221
00:19:38,576 --> 00:19:41,135
Shove up,
you overgrown bastard.

222
00:19:41,278 --> 00:19:44,645
How's your day been?
Been up in a fat sheep, have ya?

223
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:49,720
Oh, you fluffy fleecy darlings

224
00:19:49,886 --> 00:19:51,751
You with the dark brown eyes

225
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:54,256
David?

226
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:56,884
David.!

227
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:59,086
Dinner's ready.!

228
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:02,195
Did you hear me?

229
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:13,403
- Hello, Major.
- Evening, Major.

230
00:20:13,577 --> 00:20:16,808
- Evening.
- Will you be having a pint
with me then, Major?

231
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:18,814
Not tonight.
I'll buy my own.

232
00:20:20,317 --> 00:20:22,219
Otherwise
we'd never get out of here.

233
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:24,219
You know that.

234
00:20:24,355 --> 00:20:25,880
Yes, I do know that.

235
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:29,250
Thanks, Harry.

236
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:31,623
Excellent.

237
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:35,864
- John.
- Evening, sir.

238
00:20:37,201 --> 00:20:39,102
- Fancy a game?
- Aye.

239
00:20:39,202 --> 00:20:41,104
- Evening, Harry.
- Evening.

240
00:20:43,673 --> 00:20:45,939
John Niles, come here to me.

241
00:20:46,044 --> 00:20:50,001
- Is this for a drink, Tom?
- No, this is for the truth.

242
00:20:51,348 --> 00:20:53,250
Your brother.

243
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:55,250
Been hangin' around
the girls again.

244
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:59,017
You'd better keep a closer watch,
or we'll be puttin' him away.

245
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:02,720
It's all right, Pa.

246
00:21:02,826 --> 00:21:05,092
He's only throwing the ball
to 'em a little.

247
00:21:05,195 --> 00:21:07,096
A little's too much
for that sod.

248
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:09,028
Watch your tongue, Norman.

249
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:11,864
I'll watch nothin'
except my own ways.

250
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:14,871
You watch your brother,
or I'll do it for you.

251
00:21:14,971 --> 00:21:17,769
If he ever makes
a mistake again in any way...

252
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:20,777
I'll be the first
to have him put away.

253
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:27,916
David.! You've been at it for hours.!

254
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,356
Aah!

255
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,394
- Gave me a fright, you did.
- You watching him, are you?

256
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:40,931
Just lookin'.

257
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:46,169
Do you fancy him?

258
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:50,471
He's sweet, I think.

259
00:22:18,603 --> 00:22:20,501
Want anything?

260
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:30,011
Want a tomato?

261
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:32,741
- No, thanks.

262
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:35,284
Want a grapefruit?

263
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:57,271
- Hey, hey.
- Your move.

264
00:22:57,375 --> 00:23:00,241
Okay.

265
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:08,182
Check.

266
00:23:08,286 --> 00:23:11,685
- No, thank you.
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

267
00:23:11,788 --> 00:23:14,222
"This move now...

268
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:17,794
"puts black into
a desperate plight...

269
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:22,057
"with no possibility of mobilizing
his disorganized pieces.

270
00:23:22,165 --> 00:23:24,759
"Therefore, he begins
to return material...

271
00:23:24,868 --> 00:23:28,670
"to make progress
in developing at any price.

272
00:23:28,772 --> 00:23:32,799
Two pawns down,
white can conveniently-"

273
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:37,778
Hey, I bet I can undress,
do my exercises and get into bed
before you make your next move.

274
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:40,009
- Is it a deal?
- You're on.

275
00:23:41,853 --> 00:23:44,752
- Ah! No cheating.
- I'm not cheating.

276
00:23:54,397 --> 00:23:56,526
Shh, David.

277
00:24:00,203 --> 00:24:03,502
Aha! I have it.

278
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:09,510
No, no, no, David,
just a minute.

279
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:11,512
You're supposed to do a hundred.

280
00:24:11,615 --> 00:24:14,174
I did a hundred. I counted
by binary numbers. Make your move.

281
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:16,184
- Binary numbers.
- Make your move.

282
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,188
- Wait a minute.
- Come on.

283
00:24:22,826 --> 00:24:25,228
- What about that one there?
- No.

284
00:24:29,866 --> 00:24:32,769
- Uh-
- It's difficult, isn't it?

285
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:34,769
Terribly.

286
00:24:34,873 --> 00:24:37,603
Just a minute.

287
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:40,039
I think I have it.

288
00:24:40,144 --> 00:24:42,839
Um-

289
00:24:42,948 --> 00:24:45,143
Ooh.

290
00:24:46,351 --> 00:24:48,250
That puts you in.

291
00:25:09,105 --> 00:25:11,336
- Jesus!
- What are you doing?

292
00:25:11,442 --> 00:25:14,344
I gotta get my watch off.
You're an animal.

293
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:21,017
Oh, for Christ's sake.

294
00:25:21,117 --> 00:25:23,019
I'm just setting the alarm.

295
00:25:30,394 --> 00:25:32,295
Are you finished?

296
00:25:37,567 --> 00:25:40,538
- Wait a minute.
- Oh, no. What now?

297
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:44,207
David.

298
00:25:44,307 --> 00:25:47,073
David, what are you
doing down there?

299
00:25:47,178 --> 00:25:50,339
- Looking for a chess piece.
- What are you doing?

300
00:25:52,182 --> 00:25:54,083
Take a look.

301
00:25:56,688 --> 00:26:00,087
- Whoa. Did you find it?
- No, not that.

302
00:26:00,191 --> 00:26:03,125
Wait a minute.
Let me give you a hand.

303
00:26:03,259 --> 00:26:05,354
Aah.!

304
00:26:05,497 --> 00:26:07,895
David, no.!

305
00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:11,125
- No, wait! Wait a minute!
- You see it? Huh?

306
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:13,430
- No, I didn't find it.
- I think it's a rook.

307
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:16,871
No.! Aah.! No.!

308
00:26:17,008 --> 00:26:19,839
Mmm.! I love you.!

309
00:26:24,115 --> 00:26:26,015
I never cheat.

310
00:27:00,585 --> 00:27:02,815
Look, Amy,
don't play games with me.

311
00:27:05,154 --> 00:27:07,056
I've got a lot on my mind.

312
00:27:07,156 --> 00:27:09,557
You're not being fair.
I'm just trying to help.

313
00:27:16,366 --> 00:27:18,928
If you want to help,
then get your friends to finish.

314
00:27:19,037 --> 00:27:22,939
Get the garage makers and the
rat catchers- Get them all to finish!

315
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:26,306
- Oh.
- A-And fix the toilet
and clean up the kitchen.

316
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:28,309
That would be a terrific help!

317
00:27:32,048 --> 00:27:35,383
I love you, Amy,
but I want you to leave me alone.

318
00:27:43,528 --> 00:27:45,428
Okay.

319
00:27:46,596 --> 00:27:49,499
I'll leave you alone
with your blackboard.

320
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:23,066
Don't play games with me.

321
00:28:25,269 --> 00:28:27,170
No.

322
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:29,636
Don't do it, Amy.

323
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:28,829
They were practically licking my body.

324
00:29:28,967 --> 00:29:32,027
Who was practically
licking your body?

325
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:34,068
Venner and Scutt.

326
00:29:35,271 --> 00:29:37,865
I congratulate them on their taste.

327
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:40,409
Damn rat catcher staring at me.

328
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,078
Why don't you wear a bra?

329
00:29:44,182 --> 00:29:46,082
Why should I?

330
00:29:48,117 --> 00:29:52,556
You shouldn't go around without one
and not expect that type to stare.

331
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:56,192
Look...

332
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:59,693
if you could hammer a nail, Venner
and Scutt wouldn't be out there.

333
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:05,357
Listen, Amy, uh...

334
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:08,403
fixing the toaster
and getting the garage built...

335
00:30:08,538 --> 00:30:12,134
is not exactly the reason
I came here in the first place.

336
00:30:12,277 --> 00:30:15,371
Are you saying
you'd be happier if we hadn't left?

337
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,313
We left because
I got a grant to do work...

338
00:30:18,414 --> 00:30:20,941
which I haven't found
the time to do.

339
00:30:21,117 --> 00:30:23,451
You left because...

340
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:27,150
you didn't want
to take a stand, commit.

341
00:30:28,558 --> 00:30:30,323
Commit to what?

342
00:30:36,201 --> 00:30:38,134
Huh?

343
00:30:42,874 --> 00:30:44,772
I was involved with my work.

344
00:30:44,875 --> 00:30:49,711
You want something out of me
that is not right to deliver.
That's not what I was there for.

345
00:30:56,921 --> 00:30:59,355
But I know why you're here.

346
00:31:02,425 --> 00:31:04,759
Why?

347
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:08,298
Could it be because there's
no place else to hide?

348
00:31:30,121 --> 00:31:32,555
I'm here because you once said...

349
00:31:35,326 --> 00:31:38,727
y-you thought
we could be happier here.

350
00:31:40,096 --> 00:31:42,030
Remember?

351
00:31:45,536 --> 00:31:47,527
I'm sorry.

352
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:51,839
Are you sorry sorry,
or just sorry?

353
00:31:56,846 --> 00:31:58,748
Sorry sorry.

354
00:31:58,848 --> 00:32:01,214
Then come here.

355
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:15,365
I'm gonna take a bath.

356
00:32:15,464 --> 00:32:18,365
Why?
You don't need one.

357
00:32:18,469 --> 00:32:20,367
I think I do.

358
00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:32,816
Hey.

359
00:32:35,153 --> 00:32:39,212
By the way, I never claimed to be
one of the, uh, "involved."

360
00:33:02,413 --> 00:33:04,846
Don't forget
to draw the curtains.!

361
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,298
- Hello.
- Hi.

362
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:31,405
Thinking?

363
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:33,409
Mm-hmm.

364
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,779
- Don't want to come
for a walk, do you?
- Sure.

365
00:33:40,317 --> 00:33:42,218
When?

366
00:33:42,318 --> 00:33:44,220
In a little while.

367
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:49,525
Hey, hey, come on.
Come on.

368
00:34:01,939 --> 00:34:03,837
Hello.

369
00:34:03,941 --> 00:34:05,839
Good evening.

370
00:34:07,943 --> 00:34:09,536
Kitty.! Kitty.!

371
00:34:09,645 --> 00:34:11,547
Kitty, kitty.

372
00:34:11,648 --> 00:34:15,846
David, I can't find the cat.!

373
00:34:15,952 --> 00:34:19,353
Can you forget the cat
and let me work for a minute!

374
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,859
Kitty.!

375
00:34:24,961 --> 00:34:27,260
Kitty, kitty, kitty.

376
00:34:27,364 --> 00:34:29,297
Kitty.!

377
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,300
Kitty.!

378
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:34,801
- Kitty? Kitty, kitty?

379
00:34:34,938 --> 00:34:37,407
"Kitty, kitty.
Kitty, kitty, kitty."

380
00:34:37,541 --> 00:34:40,101
- Shit.
- Here, kitty, kitty.

381
00:34:44,715 --> 00:34:46,614
Other side, sir.

382
00:34:57,527 --> 00:34:59,621
- Hang on. Hang on.

383
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:02,425
- Hold it, hold it.
- Wait for him for a minute.

384
00:35:40,137 --> 00:35:42,538
Where be the blackbird

385
00:35:44,641 --> 00:35:46,974
- Oh!

386
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:54,208
- Hey, let him pass!
Let's see how good he is!

387
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:59,282
Whoo!

388
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,853
- You're out of your mind.!

389
00:36:45,603 --> 00:36:48,538
- Hello, Henry.
- Hello, Janice.

390
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:51,539
Henry! Come here!

391
00:36:51,641 --> 00:36:54,838
Oh, he's all right.
Aren't you, Henry?

392
00:37:05,322 --> 00:37:08,918
Henry, how many times
I gotta tell you, boy?

393
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,960
You don't listen.

394
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:39,621
Come on.

395
00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:42,123
Come on, Henry.
We're going home.

396
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:45,460
What do you want?

397
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:49,260
You'd have known for sure what
she was after 20 years ago, eh, Tom?

398
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:52,063
- Now, now, that'll do.

399
00:37:53,371 --> 00:37:56,635
- They still down at the hall bingoin'?
- Yeah.

400
00:37:56,739 --> 00:37:59,505
Tell her I'm behavin' meself.
I'll be along soon.

401
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,440
Bobby.!

402
00:38:03,014 --> 00:38:04,914
Run along now.

403
00:38:08,018 --> 00:38:10,043
- Hello, David.
- Hi.

404
00:38:10,152 --> 00:38:11,710
Bobby!

405
00:38:13,157 --> 00:38:15,784
Take care of your sister, mind.

406
00:38:15,893 --> 00:38:17,793
I will, Dad.

407
00:38:17,893 --> 00:38:20,795
- Bye, Mr. Sumner.
- Good-bye.

408
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:32,967
I'd like a scotch, double...

409
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:35,306
with ice.

410
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,159
Cheers.

411
00:38:59,302 --> 00:39:01,293
- Evening, Major.

412
00:39:01,438 --> 00:39:02,405
- Evening, Major.
- Evening, Major.

413
00:39:02,405 --> 00:39:03,338
- Evening, Major.
- Evening, Major.

414
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,034
- Mr. Sumner?
- Yes?

415
00:39:06,143 --> 00:39:10,101
I was about to call up to your farm to
welcome you into our little community.

416
00:39:10,213 --> 00:39:12,114
I've just been welcomed.

417
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,815
- I'm John Scott.
- Hello.

418
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,320
I saw your car outside. I thought
perhaps we could drive up together.

419
00:39:19,422 --> 00:39:21,583
I wanted to have
the good Reverend and Mrs. Hood...

420
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:25,650
talk you into joining us at the
church social this coming Thursday.

421
00:39:25,795 --> 00:39:27,855
The vicar will run me home.

422
00:39:27,998 --> 00:39:30,728
Can I buy you a drink, Major,
before you go?

423
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:34,498
No, thank you, Tom.
We're in a hurry.

424
00:39:42,813 --> 00:39:44,713
Buy 'em all one.

425
00:39:50,487 --> 00:39:52,547
- Good night, Major.
- Good night, Major.

426
00:39:52,655 --> 00:39:54,646
Watch out for sheep.!

427
00:39:54,791 --> 00:39:57,659
- You got your
Wellington boots on, Major?

428
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:02,664
Now, some men
goes for women

429
00:40:02,766 --> 00:40:05,668
And some men
goes for boys

430
00:40:05,768 --> 00:40:08,670
But my love's
warm and beautiful

431
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:10,900
And makes
a baa-in' noise

432
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:13,942
- Amy, nice to see you.

433
00:40:14,043 --> 00:40:17,172
- Major, why haven't you
been out to see us before?
- Shearing time. My apologies.

434
00:40:17,313 --> 00:40:20,215
- I see you brought
my drunken husband home.
- Come on, I'm not drunk yet.

435
00:40:20,317 --> 00:40:21,840
Certainly not my fault.

436
00:40:21,985 --> 00:40:23,920
- Hi. I'm David Sumner.
- I just brought him home.

437
00:40:24,054 --> 00:40:25,954
- Barny Hood.
- Reverend.

438
00:40:26,056 --> 00:40:27,956
- My wife.
- Mrs. Hood.

439
00:40:28,056 --> 00:40:30,958
- Hello.
- Well, well. Please sit down.

440
00:40:31,061 --> 00:40:33,427
- Barny. Louise.
- Hello, Major.

441
00:40:38,802 --> 00:40:41,271
- What are you drinking, Reverend?

442
00:40:41,405 --> 00:40:43,304
Scotch.

443
00:40:52,614 --> 00:40:54,675
The reverend and his wife...

444
00:40:54,818 --> 00:40:57,719
came to invite us to a party
at the church hall next week, David.

445
00:40:57,822 --> 00:40:59,722
Oh.

446
00:40:59,824 --> 00:41:03,123
Well, it's, uh, going to be more than
an invitation, Reverend, isn't it?

447
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:05,784
Major, you gave away
our secret plan.

448
00:41:05,896 --> 00:41:08,864
- Who said anything about money?
- I was thinking of about five-

449
00:41:08,931 --> 00:41:11,458
I'll take it.
Thank you very much.

450
00:41:11,601 --> 00:41:14,536
And I expect to see you both
at the social and at the church...

451
00:41:14,637 --> 00:41:16,572
when you can spare the time.

452
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:21,268
Time is a little difficult to find
these days. Uh, so are cats.

453
00:41:21,411 --> 00:41:25,041
By the way, Amy, did you find
your, uh, kitty, kitty, kitty?

454
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:28,184
No.

455
00:41:28,251 --> 00:41:31,186
At least give us some hope
about your coming to church.

456
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:34,849
- Yes. After all, hope is your business,
Barny, isn't it?
- Yes, and faith.

457
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:38,188
- And charity.

458
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:41,230
- Thanks.
- Amy's been telling us
why you came to Wakely.

459
00:41:41,364 --> 00:41:44,197
- To write, to meditate.
- Why did you come?

460
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:46,496
I was drafted.

461
00:41:46,637 --> 00:41:48,536
- Well, tell us what you do.
- Okay.

462
00:41:49,672 --> 00:41:52,436
I'm a, uh,
astral mathematician.

463
00:41:52,576 --> 00:41:54,771
Oh. Never heard of it.

464
00:41:54,878 --> 00:41:57,574
- That's because I just made it up.

465
00:41:57,748 --> 00:41:59,579
I'll get you another drink.

466
00:41:59,681 --> 00:42:02,378
I have a grant to study, uh...

467
00:42:02,518 --> 00:42:06,320
possible structures
in stellar interiors...

468
00:42:06,422 --> 00:42:09,186
and the implications regarding
their radiation characteristics.

469
00:42:09,326 --> 00:42:12,489
- Am I boring anyone?
- Radiation- That's
an unfortunate dispensation.

470
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:15,793
It surely is.
Yes, indeed.

471
00:42:15,931 --> 00:42:19,061
As long as it's not
another bomb.

472
00:42:19,168 --> 00:42:22,434
You're a scientist.
Can you deny the responsibility?

473
00:42:22,572 --> 00:42:24,063
Can you?

474
00:42:25,976 --> 00:42:28,842
After all, there's never been
a kingdom given to so much bloodshed...

475
00:42:28,978 --> 00:42:31,139
as that of Christ.

476
00:42:32,483 --> 00:42:35,418
- That's Montesquieu, isn't it?
- Oh, really?

477
00:42:35,552 --> 00:42:37,713
Who's he?

478
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:41,554
Somebody well worth reading.

479
00:42:45,795 --> 00:42:47,922
We'd better leave
these good people.

480
00:42:48,032 --> 00:42:51,195
Yes, well, you won't let me
walk home, will you, Barny?

481
00:42:51,335 --> 00:42:53,565
Mrs. Hood,
you're very lovely.

482
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:56,103
- I'll get your coat.
- Does God bore you, Amy?

483
00:42:56,239 --> 00:42:59,106
In the areas of boredom, Mrs. Hood,
God is not my problem.

484
00:43:03,146 --> 00:43:05,239
You were... awful
to the reverend.

485
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:07,646
No, no, no, no.
I wasn't.

486
00:43:07,784 --> 00:43:11,277
He's all right.
I like him.

487
00:43:11,454 --> 00:43:13,355
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

488
00:43:13,456 --> 00:43:15,516
His wife is very attractive.

489
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:18,059
Oh.

490
00:43:18,161 --> 00:43:20,596
Yes, she is, isn't she?

491
00:43:24,034 --> 00:43:27,936
- Here, I think l-
I think you need some help.

492
00:43:29,706 --> 00:43:31,606
- David.
- Hmm?

493
00:43:31,708 --> 00:43:34,371
What's a binary number?

494
00:43:34,545 --> 00:43:38,172
Uh, zeroes or ones...

495
00:43:38,349 --> 00:43:40,213
plus or minus.

496
00:43:41,418 --> 00:43:44,318
In sequences of twos.

497
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:46,411
- Hey, that's right.

498
00:43:48,492 --> 00:43:50,391
You're a bright lady.

499
00:43:52,496 --> 00:43:54,088
You're not so dumb.

500
00:43:55,532 --> 00:43:57,295
Sometimes I need help.

501
00:43:57,434 --> 00:43:59,367
When?

502
00:44:01,271 --> 00:44:04,068
Like, um, now, maybe.

503
00:44:08,945 --> 00:44:10,846
You got it.

504
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:19,389
What's the matter?

505
00:45:02,297 --> 00:45:05,027
Scutt or Cawsey.

506
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:12,773
I've locked all the doors
and windows downstairs.

507
00:45:12,909 --> 00:45:15,538
Let's keep them locked
from now on. All right?

508
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:17,579
Great.

509
00:45:22,452 --> 00:45:24,353
Did you hear me?

510
00:45:24,454 --> 00:45:26,355
What?

511
00:45:26,456 --> 00:45:28,891
Scutt or Cawsey.

512
00:45:30,527 --> 00:45:34,018
- Why?
- To prove to you they could
get into your bedroom.

513
00:45:37,701 --> 00:45:40,635
I don't believe that.

514
00:45:40,771 --> 00:45:44,172
Well, who else
is around all the time?

515
00:45:44,273 --> 00:45:46,172
Amy, uh...

516
00:45:46,275 --> 00:45:48,675
we've left all...
the doors unlocked.

517
00:45:48,777 --> 00:45:51,373
I mean, it could have
been anybody passing.

518
00:45:51,514 --> 00:45:53,414
- "Anybody passing"?

519
00:45:53,516 --> 00:45:56,418
David, a complete stranger
comes into our house...

520
00:45:56,518 --> 00:45:59,512
and decides to strangle our cat
and hang her in the wardrobe?

521
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:02,021
- Somebody passing?

522
00:46:17,708 --> 00:46:20,608
Cawsey or Scutt.

523
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:26,750
Here, Charlie.
It's bloody heavy.

524
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:27,978
Here, Charlie.
It's bloody heavy.

525
00:46:28,117 --> 00:46:31,018
Lousy way to make a livin; though.

526
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:33,521
You gonna look at them all day?

527
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:39,260
Would you feel better
if I went out and talked to them?

528
00:46:39,362 --> 00:46:42,992
Not necessarily.
Perhaps we could just pack up and leave.

529
00:46:44,501 --> 00:46:46,400
Nobody's leaving.

530
00:46:47,938 --> 00:46:50,202
Why? Because we paid for a year?

531
00:46:51,574 --> 00:46:54,668
Look, Amy,
I'm not going to...

532
00:46:54,777 --> 00:46:57,679
just go out there
and blatantly accuse them.

533
00:46:58,782 --> 00:47:01,114
You don't have to accuse them.

534
00:47:01,217 --> 00:47:06,155
You could start by mentioning that our
cat was strangled and see what happens.

535
00:47:08,592 --> 00:47:11,117
You can believe in the possibility,
can't you?

536
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:13,456
Okay. Okay.

537
00:47:15,331 --> 00:47:18,824
I'll go out and mention to them
that the cat is missing...

538
00:47:18,969 --> 00:47:21,869
and I'll ask them
if they've seen her.

539
00:47:23,974 --> 00:47:26,840
All right,
let's see what it's good for.

540
00:47:28,244 --> 00:47:30,907
- You don't think that's enough, do you?
- Not quite.

541
00:47:32,681 --> 00:47:36,083
Perhaps you'd like to write them
a note on your blackboard.

542
00:47:39,989 --> 00:47:42,891
Well, I thought he might enjoy it.

543
00:48:01,411 --> 00:48:04,106
- How are you?
- Fine, thank you, sir.

544
00:48:04,248 --> 00:48:06,715
- How's it, uh, going up there?
- It's all right, sir.

545
00:48:06,849 --> 00:48:09,045
Yeah. Want a smoke?

546
00:48:09,186 --> 00:48:12,121
I like the smell of those
American cigarettes, Mr. Sumner.

547
00:48:15,958 --> 00:48:20,588
Can you give me a hand with that
mantrap? Just wanna get it in the house.

548
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:37,840
Uh, right through here.

549
00:48:37,981 --> 00:48:40,347
Right here by the fireplace.

550
00:48:40,449 --> 00:48:42,349
Thanks.

551
00:48:47,523 --> 00:48:50,721
Amy, listen.
I'm gonna catch them off guard.

552
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:53,762
- When?
- Right now.

553
00:48:53,864 --> 00:48:56,492
Open or closed, Mr. Sumner?

554
00:48:58,601 --> 00:49:00,570
Uh, gee, I don't know.

555
00:49:02,371 --> 00:49:04,306
Uh, open it.

556
00:49:06,809 --> 00:49:09,335
If you can.

557
00:49:16,085 --> 00:49:17,985
Sorry, Charlie.

558
00:49:18,088 --> 00:49:19,987
Bite, sir.

559
00:49:21,489 --> 00:49:23,391
I can appreciate that.

560
00:49:25,094 --> 00:49:26,994
Be careful.

561
00:49:29,666 --> 00:49:31,599
Watch that hand
on the spring.

562
00:49:31,702 --> 00:49:34,101
Pretty dangerous thing, sir.

563
00:49:39,275 --> 00:49:42,335
- This is the, uh, safety lock, sir.
- Right.

564
00:49:42,445 --> 00:49:44,346
Where would you like it, sir?

565
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:47,007
Uh, put it right over
the fireplace there.

566
00:49:53,922 --> 00:49:56,119
You fellows like some beer?

567
00:49:56,259 --> 00:49:59,159
- Very nice.
- Oh, very welcome.

568
00:50:05,534 --> 00:50:07,833
Thank you.

569
00:50:12,376 --> 00:50:14,275
Cheers.

570
00:50:23,719 --> 00:50:25,688
Uh, cheers, miss.

571
00:50:25,822 --> 00:50:28,052
Cheers.

572
00:50:29,826 --> 00:50:31,918
- Mr. Sumner.
- Huh?

573
00:50:32,027 --> 00:50:34,963
Would you like to
shoot with us sometime?

574
00:50:36,297 --> 00:50:38,563
Oh, I've, uh-
I never hunted much.

575
00:50:39,802 --> 00:50:42,965
Oh, but you've, uh,
shot, Mr. Sumner?

576
00:50:44,907 --> 00:50:47,206
Just once or twice,
but that was-

577
00:50:47,344 --> 00:50:49,608
Be easy then.
You should try it, sir.

578
00:50:49,746 --> 00:50:53,648
Living here at Trencher's, with good
shootin'outside the door. Eh, Norman?

579
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:55,775
Right. Right, sir.

580
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:03,123
When?

581
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:05,090
How about tomorrow, sir?

582
00:51:09,364 --> 00:51:11,266
Okay. Thank you.

583
00:51:11,367 --> 00:51:15,634
That m- That might be... fun.
I'd like that.

584
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:18,139
Thank you.

585
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:24,478
What about the garage?

586
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:26,242
It can wait.

587
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:38,061
We'll meet at Wakely
at about half past 8:00.

588
00:51:38,195 --> 00:51:41,322
- You know the pub?
- Yes, I do.

589
00:51:41,465 --> 00:51:43,797
Well, we'd better
get back to work, sir.

590
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:46,094
Thank you for putting that up.

591
00:51:46,235 --> 00:51:48,635
That's all right, sir.

592
00:51:48,737 --> 00:51:50,797
Oh, I, uh,
I don't have a gun.

593
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:52,840
But, uh-

594
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:54,431
will this do?

595
00:51:54,577 --> 00:51:56,478
Ah.

596
00:51:56,579 --> 00:51:58,672
There'll be plenty extra, sir.

597
00:51:58,815 --> 00:52:00,476
Good.

598
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:02,481
- Thank you for the drink, sir.
- Thank you.

599
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:04,449
- You're welcome.
- Thanks for the drink, sir.

600
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:06,315
Oh, it's my pleasure.

601
00:52:42,092 --> 00:52:44,992
Hey, Charlie, Charlie.
Wait, wait, wait.

602
