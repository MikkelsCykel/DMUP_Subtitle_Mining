00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,120
Stick with him.
Don't let him get too far ahead.

3
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,360
- Daddy, I'm tired. Can't we stop?
- Yeah, honey.

4
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:12,800
There isn't any people on the side streets.
And they're darker.

5
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,240
- That's just what they'd want, honey.
- Daddy, I'm scared.

6
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,760
So am I, honey. Hang on.
Be light. Be a feather.

7
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,400
- What's going on?
- Excuse me!

8
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,120
" He's seen us.
Whatever you do, no eye contact.

9
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,600
- He can make you do what he wants.
- " Got it.

10
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,640
" See him?
He just got lost in that crowd there.

11
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,920
" That's him, over on the right.
Right there on the right.

12
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,320
<i>Maybe I can cut him off at the corner.</i>

13
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,600
Let's get him.

14
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,560
Daddy, they're coming.

15
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,640
Taxi. Taxi.

16
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,000
Drive.

17
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,680
- Stop!
- Stop the car. Hey, cabbie.

18
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,320
Don't pay any attention to them.
Just drive.

19
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:18,280
Come on, let's get back to the car.
We can chase them down. Let's move it.

20
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,520
- Hey, mister, where are we going?
- The airport.

21
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,360
Wait, wait, I can't go to the airport.
It's too far.

22
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,440
Look...

23
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:38,120
I'm gonna give you a $500 bill. I want you
to take my daughter and I to the airport.

24
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,360
Sure. OK, mister.

25
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:49,720
- " Drive.
- I ain't turning down no $500.

26
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:07,480
We are going to give each one of you ten
young ladies and gentlemen an injection.

27
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,240
Five of these injections will be water.

28
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,040
Five of them will be water mixed with
a tiny amount of a chemical compound

29
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,480
which we call... "lot six".

30
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,440
The exact nature
of this compound is classified

31
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,920
but it is essentially
a hypnotic mild hallucinogenic.

32
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:34,320
We employ the double-blind method
of administering the compound,

33
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:40,360
which is to say that neither you nor we
know who has received the clear dose

34
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,520
and who has not.

35
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,880
Until later, that is.

36
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,280
You will be under close supervision
for 48 hours after the experiment.

37
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,480
Are there any questions?

38
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,040
Dr Wanless, is this experiment
being done by The Shop?

39
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,080
No.

40
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,320
Absolutely not.

41
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,320
- Yes?
- When do I get my money?

42
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,160
- " Right on, man.
- That is important.

43
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,781
Well, immediately after the experiment,
along with all the other students.

44
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,040
I'm broke too.

45
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,960
So, if we may begin
the injections now, please.

46
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,520
Andy McGee.

47
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:31,400
I'm Vicky Tomlinson. I'm a little nervous
about this, Andy McGee.

48
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,402
- What if I go on a bad trip?

49
00:05:33,402 --> 00:05:36,712
- We'll probably just get distilled water.

50
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,840
" Feel any pain?

51
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,800
<i>I feel a pressure. It's a bad pressure.</i>

52
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,120
" It will pass.

53
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,536
- How are you feeling?

54
00:06:04,536 --> 00:06:06,744
- When do we start to shrink?

55
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,400
You believe you're going to shrink?

56
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:17,800
Sh-ri-nk...

57
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,640
You'll be fine.

58
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,680
We'll be fine.

59
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,240
" I can't feel my hands.

60
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,054
- Thank you. What a nice compliment.

61
00:06:47,437 --> 00:06:48,800
You did.

62
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,555
- What'd I say?

63
00:06:51,555 --> 00:06:54,342
- You said my hair is beautiful.

64
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,760
Like copper set on fire.

65
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,840
Yeah.

66
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:04,160
But I didn't say that. I just thought it.

67
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,920
<i>I love you.
I've always loved you.</i>

68
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,400
<i>- I've known you for a thousand years.
- That long?</i>

69
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,280
<i>Yes, I've loved you too.</i>

70
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,600
Hey, buddy, airport.

71
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,920
You OK?

72
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:58,920
I got a headache. Wake up, babydoll.

73
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,120
We're here. Come on.

74
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,080
Where are we?

75
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,720
Hanover, sweetheart. Airport.

76
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,291
- Try the airport.

77
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:11,760
- Roger.

78
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,920
Suppose we catch up with him.
Do you wanna face him down?

79
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:31,640
What do you call this thing he's got?
How he pushes people.

80
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,560
The Shop figures
he may be running down by now.

81
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,600
He's overdone it before
and wound up in bed.

82
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,760
It's doing something to his brain.

83
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,760
Like what?

84
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:46,240
Giving himself
pinprick haemorrhages, maybe?

85
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,640
- It could kill him.
- Good, let's hope.

86
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:01,520
We don't have any more money
and we don't have anything left to sell.

87
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,640
I can't stay here.

88
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,520
It's not right. It's not right to steal.

89
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:12,680
Honey, I know, but it's not right
for them to keep coming after us, either.

90
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,280
Now, I explained that to you, Charlie,
at least I tried.

91
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,903
- About the big bad and the little bad?

92
00:09:18,903 --> 00:09:21,986
- That's right. Lesser and greater evil.

93
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:27,720
- Big bad is what I did to Mommy?
- Oh, darling, please.

94
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,600
Don't. Don't, baby.

95
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,640
I made Mommy scream.

96
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,720
Shh...

97
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,480
Does your head still hurt?

98
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,600
Poor Daddy.

99
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,440
Gotta keep a lookout.

100
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,840
OK.

101
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,120
" I don't know
what you're doing here.

102
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:14,960
I don't want to have anything to do with
you. I told you not to follow me here.

103
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:20,120
Besides, it's not my fault.
I'm not responsible.

104
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,200
This ain't got nothing to do with me.
I'm not the only guy you've been seeing.

105
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,200
I'm not ready to get married,
so why don't you just get outta here?

106
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,258
- Why don't you just stop bugging me?

107
00:10:31,258 --> 00:10:32,178
-  Come on, Charlie.

108
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,680
" You told me you loved me.

109
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,720
You told me if anything
happened you'd take care of me.

110
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:06,080
This ain't got nothing to do with me.
We've been through this 100 times.

111
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:11,040
I'm not responsible.
Look, I told you not to follow me here.

112
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,680
" But I can't do it on my own.
I don't know where to go.

113
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,124
- I don't have any money.

114
00:11:18,124 --> 00:11:20,253
- I'm not the only guy you've been with.

115
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,360
That's not true.

116
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:27,000
I swear to God you're the only one.
I've never slept with anyone else.

117
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,760
" That's not
what my buddy Al told me...

118
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,280
I didn't mean it, Daddy.

119
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,880
- Ow!
- Hey, hey!

120
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,694
- All right, buddy, come outta there.

121
00:11:57,694 --> 00:11:59,970
- Mind waiting till I put my feet out?

122
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:05,560
I was coming with you and I saw him and
before I could stop it, it just happened.

123
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,640
- I didn't like him and it just got away.
- It's OK, honey.

124
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,480
- But I set him on fire.
- Charlie.

125
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,200
- I didn't mean it, Daddy.
- Charlie, stop it.

126
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:19,080
I want you to listen to me.
You said it got away from you and it did.

127
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,160
But not like before.
It just got away a little bit.

128
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:29,240
Charlie, you might've set
that man's face on fire or his hair.

129
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,520
Now, it always goes out
at somebody you don't like.

130
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,490
- But you didn't really hurt that guy.

131
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:36,634
- Not like I hurt Mommy in the kitchen.

132
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:41,880
Baby. Baby, you've got
to stop thinking about that.

133
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,760
It wasn't you that really hurt Mommy.

134
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,240
They killed her.

135
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,400
That's right. That's right.

136
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,680
Now...

137
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,800
We've got to go on.

138
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,640
Single file. Just like the Indians.

139
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:14,760
And keep as far over
to the side of the road as you can, OK?

140
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:33,120
" I seen them both.
This guy looked kinda sick, or something.

141
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,120
Are you OK?

142
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,391
- So far, so good, baby. You getting tired?

143
00:13:42,391 --> 00:13:43,747
- Nope.

144
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:48,520
Daddy, I feel those bad men
from The Shop around again.

145
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,640
OK. Come on.

146
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,520
OK, sweetheart, come on.

147
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,800
Head up Route 70.

148
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,880
Oh, Daddy.

149
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:18,160
<i>"- " Daddy, get up.</i>

150
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,360
Daddy, wake up.

151
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,680
Daddy? Daddy?

152
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,760
Are you all right?

153
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:48,000
- I thought you were dead.
- Are you kidding?

154
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:52,880
Think I'd do that to you?
You're all I've got in this world.

155
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,600
But I'm happy about that
cos I'm crazy about you.

156
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,120
I'm crazy about you too, Daddy.

157
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:11,040
Come on. We gotta find a place to sleep.

158
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,040
We can afford it now.

159
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:39,760
- I burned him.
- Rest, sweetheart.

160
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:43,120
You didn't hurt him. You controlled it.

161
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,200
Shh...

162
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,760
<i>OK, Charlie.</i>

163
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,760
Now, let it out. Easy does it.

164
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,800
Let it go.

165
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,160
Attagirl.

166
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,000
Attagirl. OK.

167
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,000
Now pull it back.

168
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:13,120
Pull it back, Charlie.
Pull it back, Charlie.

169
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,200
Good Lord.

170
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:26,440
Now, you've got to learn to control that.
You gotta try real hard. OK?

171
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,400
- I couldn't help it.
- Tomorrow. She's tired.

172
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:34,680
Time for bed.
You can try again at breakfast.

173
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,720
- I wanna do that again.
- No, tomorrow.

174
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,840
I'm not tired. I wanna do it again.

175
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,800
- I said no.
- Again. Now!

176
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,320
I'm sorry, Mommy. I didn't mean it.

177
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,680
Well, you did it. You hurt your mother.

178
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,266
- I'm sorry, Mommy.

179
00:16:59,266 --> 00:17:01,075
- It's all right. Mommy's all right.

180
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,000
Charlie, you have got to control this thing

181
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:07,040
because it's a bad thing,
you understand me? A bad thing.

182
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:11,160
Leave her alone. It's not her fault.

183
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,640
- Hello?
- Sorry.

184
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,600
- Hung up again?
- Whoever it is.

185
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:26,800
We know who they are and they wanna
make sure we're staying right here.

186
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,480
<i>Vicky? Charlie?</i>

187
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,120
I'm home.

188
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,200
Sweetheart?

189
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,000
Vicky!

190
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,920
Oh...

191
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,680
Oh, no.

192
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:27,080
Oh, no. Please, please, God.

193
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,280
Please don't be here.

194
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,200
Please don't...

195
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,320
Oh, no! Please, no, no!

196
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,160
Oh, no! Babe! Oh, what did they do?

197
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:44,120
What did they do?
They put this in your mouth.

198
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,960
Where's Charlie? Charlie!

199
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,360
Charlie!

200
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,200
Charlie!

201
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,280
Charlie!

202
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,680
Charlie!

203
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,000
Charlie!

204
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,360
Joan,
by any chance is my daughter with you?

205
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,520
<i>Hold her!</i>

206
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,080
OK, that's far enough.

207
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,320
Drop the gun.

208
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,520
Drop it.

209
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,080
Bring her to me.

210
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,680
You're blind.

211
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,640
" My eyes!

212
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:31,240
You too, you son of a bitch.
You killed my wife. You're blind.

213
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,080
" My eyes!

214
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,200
Oh, my God! Leon!

215
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,360
- Andy!
- " My eyes!

216
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,880
Joan.

217
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:51,400
Go back inside the house.
You won't remember any of this.

218
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,400
- Leon!
- Oh, God!

219
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,560
My eyes! Son of a bitch!

220
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,360
Can't see!

221
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:20,120
- Wake up, baby. It's time to move on.
- Morning.

222
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,520
- Elaine. Morning, Josie.
- Good morning.

223
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,800
Jamieson called in. No word yet
on the McGees. He'll ring later.

224
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,760
Put him right through when he does.

225
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:53,080
And Rainbird is in your office.

226
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,240
- When did he get back?
- This morning.

227
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,040
- Morning, Kenny.
- Morning, sir.

228
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,240
Welcome back, Rainbird.

229
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,160
How was Venice?

230
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,120
Sinking.

231
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,605
- Is our problem there solved?

232
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:38,414
- Our problem there is solved.

233
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,320
- Dr Wanless is here.
- Christ, there goes a beautiful day.

234
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,160
Ah, the good doctor.
What do you want, Joe?

235
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:59,360
- Have you caught them yet?
- We'll catch them. What do you want?

236
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:04,000
What do I always want?
Why do I stay alive?

237
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,000
To try to persuade you
to sanction them both,

238
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,280
expunge them,
wipe them from the face of the earth.

239
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,760
Andrew McGee and his daughter

240
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,120
constitute the greatest threat
that's confronted this nation.

241
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,200
- That's a lot of crap.
- You feel guilt!

242
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:25,520
Eight out of ten of our young volunteers
have died, committed suicide.

243
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,760
You want to justify your participation.

244
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,480
You were all in favour of it at the time.

245
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,560
I know.

246
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,760
I didn't realise.

247
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,400
None of us did.

248
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:51,480
Lot Six was nothing more
than a synthetic copy of pituitary extract.

249
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:57,000
- A powerful painkiller hallucinogen.
- For God's sake, Joe, don't start again.

250
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,040
You see...

251
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,720
You see...

252
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:18,320
This pituitary extract is responsible
for the occasional flashes of psi ability

253
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:21,280
which most human beings demonstrate
from time to time.

254
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,760
Precognition, telekinesis,
mental domination,

255
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:30,160
the kind of domination that this
experiment brought out in Andrew McGee.

256
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,320
What is the point, Doctor?

257
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:37,040
Since this child was born, her father has
tried to inhibit her use of those powers.

258
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:43,040
But what if his control
had weakened now?

259
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:47,960
Why would he lose control now
after all these years?

260
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,160
Ask yourself this question.

261
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:55,600
How exhausting must it have been
for Victoria and Andrew McGee

262
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,000
when this child was an infant?

263
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:01,000
The bottle is late. The baby cries.

264
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:05,320
And at that moment, one of her stuffed
toys right there in the crib beside her

265
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,880
bursts into smoky flame.

266
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,440
Joe, she's just a little girl.
She can light fires, yes,

267
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,715
but you're making her sound
like Armageddon.

268
00:25:14,255 --> 00:25:17,960
That's what it might well be.

269
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,272
Suppose lighting fires
is merely the tip of the iceberg.

270
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,920
I don't know what you're talking about.

271
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,680
I am talking about a talent
that is directly linked

272
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:31,640
to this child's pituitary gland,
undeveloped pituitary gland.

273
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,261
What happens when she becomes
adolescent and that sleeping gland wakes

274
00:25:34,153 --> 00:25:40,771
and becomes, for 20 months, the most
powerful force in the human body?

275
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:47,480
Suppose we have a child here
who some day is capable

276
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,720
of creating a nuclear explosion
simply by the power of her will.

277
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,737
- That's insane.

278
00:25:54,737 --> 00:25:56,780
- Is it? Is it?

279
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:00,360
Then allow me to progress
from insanity to utter lunacy.

280
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,720
Suppose there is a little girl out there
somewhere today, this morning,

281
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,840
who has within her,
lying dormant at present,

282
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:14,640
the power some day
to crack the very planet in two,

283
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,840
like a china plate in a shooting gallery.

284
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:30,080
What if we could train this little girl?
And others as well.

285
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,160
Could we have more powerful weapons?

286
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,640
No! No more experiments.

287
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:38,000
Don't force me to go above your head
because I will if I have to.

288
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:41,800
I'll have you and this entire establishment
eliminated.

289
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,480
An excitable man.

290
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,760
Where are we gonna go now?

291
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,760
We have to find some place
to stay for a while.

292
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,760
I don't think anybody'll believe us
but if we send letters to the newspapers

293
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,953
maybe The Shop will have to lay off.

294
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,560
We could go to Granther's.

295
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,227
- What made you think of that?

296
00:27:22,194 --> 00:27:23,468
- I don't know.

297
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:28,840
Cos I was thinking about your grandfather
not five minutes ago.

298
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:40,720
We'll check the motel.
I want you to work the road further down.

299
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,800
Well... That's a pretty little miss.

300
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,360
- What's your name, missy?
- Roberta.

301
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:55,040
Well, Bobby, where are you headed for?

302
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:59,440
We're headed for Tennessee. Knoxville.
My wife's there visiting her sister.

303
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,560
- Ran into a little problem.
- Did she?

304
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:06,080
Yeah, labour. This one's got
a new baby brother. 1.40 this morning.

305
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:09,332
- His name's Andy. Isn't that a nice name?

306
00:28:09,332 --> 00:28:10,568
- I think it's a corker.

307
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:15,320
Mine's Irv Manders. Hop in.
I'll get you ten miles closer to Knoxville.

308
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,920
- Hey, Al, it's them.
- You're joking?

309
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,445
- No, damn it, it's them.

310
00:28:43,445 --> 00:28:44,859
- Did you get the number?

311
00:28:44,859 --> 00:28:46,459
- Did you see which way they went?

312
00:28:46,459 --> 00:28:47,919
- I didn't even see them check out.

313
00:28:47,863 --> 00:28:48,794
Hey, we got them.

314
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:05,720
Why don't you two come home,
take lunch with me and the wife?

315
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,294
- We couldn't...

316
00:29:07,294 --> 00:29:09,920
- Daddy, I'm starving.

317
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,556
- Are you sure you got enough?

318
00:29:11,556 --> 00:29:14,120
- Always, and I'm glad to have you.

319
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,912
- Thank you very much.

320
00:29:15,912 --> 00:29:18,320
- My pleasure, Bobby.

321
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:21,680
It'll be my wife's too
when she gets a look at you.

322
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,800
Always wanted a little girl herself.

323
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,480
But I guess that wasn't to be.

324
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,520
" Got a song for you.

325
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,625
♫ Oh, there was an old hen
She had a wooden leg ♫

326
00:29:38,625 --> 00:29:42,602
♫ Finest old hen that ever laid an egg ♫

327
00:29:42,602 --> 00:29:46,966
♫ She laid her eggs all over the farm
Another little drink won't do us any harm ♫

328
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,520
- Who'd you bring home, Irv?
- This little girl is Roberta.

329
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,720
This young fella here's her daddy.

330
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,841
I didn't catch his name yet
so I don't know if we're related.

331
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,402
- Frank Burton, ma'am.

332
00:30:11,402 --> 00:30:13,440
- Hello, I'm Norma Manders.

333
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,458
- Hi.

334
00:30:15,458 --> 00:30:17,360
- Hello.

335
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:24,800
Your husband invited us back for lunch.
Hope you don't mind.

336
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:27,120
Why, sure. Come on in.

337
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,200
Come on, Bobby. Feedbag.

338
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:05,000
More room out than there is in, button.

339
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:10,160
If I eat any more, I think I'll split.
That's what my mom used to...

340
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:14,840
I mean that's what she always says.

341
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,280
Norma, why don't you and Bobby go out
and feed those chickens?

342
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:24,920
I wanna have a little talk with Frank here.

343
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,360
- Would you like that?
- Do they peck?

344
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,080
Only what they eat, honey.

345
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,680
- Come on.
- OK. Goody.

346
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:41,520
Want a beer, Frank?

347
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:44,930
- It isn't Frank, but I guess you know that.

348
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:47,960
- I guess I did.

349
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,960
- What is your name?
- Andy.

350
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:55,280
- Well, Andy, what about that beer?
- I guess I could use it.

351
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,360
You got it.

352
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,920
- There you go.
- Thank you.

353
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:11,200
- Here, let me help.
- No, that's all right. I know this routine.

354
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,033
- Cops after you, Andy?

355
00:32:19,033 --> 00:32:21,440
- Sort of cops, yeah.

356
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,520
You snatch that little girl from her mother?

357
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:30,680
No, she's my daughter,
but her mother didn't set the cops on us.

358
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,720
Her mother's been dead for a year.

359
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,083
Don't appear like you got her
against her will.

360
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,143
What do they want you for, anyway, Andy?
- Who are they?

361
00:32:43,143 --> 00:32:44,583
- Government agents.

362
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,560
- FBI?
- No, The Shop.

363
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,880
The Shop?

364
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:56,520
Yeah, it's really the Department
of Scientific Intelligence. DSI.

365
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:01,640
My daughter, Charlene and I, Charlie,

366
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:06,960
we were part of an experiment
that happened a long time ago.

367
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,360
Tell me about it.

368
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,720
OK, now go ahead.

369
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:15,760
Thank you. Do you eat these chickens?

370
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:19,840
If I can catch one, I might eat one.
We eat the eggs.

371
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,120
They want to examine her and study her.

372
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:26,560
So they can figure out just what makes
her able to do what she can do.

373
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,920
I think they want to use her
to reactivate the Lot Six programme.

374
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:35,120
Andy, I think you ought to call the police.
Turn yourself in.

375
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,393
- Yeah, I know it sounds crazy.

376
00:33:37,393 --> 00:33:39,600
- As crazy as anything I've ever heard.

377
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,840
Daddy, I fed the chic...

378
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,960
You told.

379
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:50,040
Daddy, why'd you tell?

380
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:57,400
They're coming. They're coming for us.

381
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:05,960
They're gonna kill you, Daddy. We have
to run, we have to hide, we have to...

382
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:10,960
Yes, yes, that's what they wanna do.
They wanna kill you.

383
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:14,360
Kill you like they did Mommy
and take me away. I won't let it happen.

384
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,200
Holy Jesus Christ. Did she do that?

385
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,640
Charlie, now, watch what you're doing.

386
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:27,120
Is it too late?

387
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:30,480
Yes, they're coming up the dirt road now.

388
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,040
Daddy, I'm scared.

389
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,880
Charlie, you can stop them.

390
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:43,480
If I do something bad,
will you still love me?

391
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:46,800
Oh, Charlie...

392
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,560
Of course I'll still love you.

393
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:52,480
I love you more than anything
in the world, no matter what happens.

394
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:03,160
I got some tall apologising to do.
There's a line of cars coming up the road.

395
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,160
I'll stand with you if you want.
I'll get my deer gun.

396
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,320
You don't need your gun.

397
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,440
Hi, Andy. Hi, Charlie.

398
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,581
- Honey, you don't have to run any more.

399
00:35:46,581 --> 00:35:48,160
- Go away.

400
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:52,360
Afraid I can't do that, honey.
I have my orders.

401
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,360
No one wants to hurt you or your daddy.

402
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,960
You liar, you're supposed to kill him
and I know it.

403
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:02,080
I'd advise you do what my daughter says.

404
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:05,360
You know why she's wanted.
Remember the soldier at the airport?

405
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,160
You men are trespassing.
I want you to get off my property.

406
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,280
We're government agents, sir.

407
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,800
These two folks are wanted
for questioning. Nothing more.

408
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,880
I don't care if they're wanted
for assassination.

409
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,462
- Show me a warrant or get off my land.

410
00:36:23,462 --> 00:36:24,280
- We don't need a warrant.

411
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,351
You do unless I woke up
in Russia this morning.

412
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:30,480
If you'll just get in the car,
we can discuss all this.

413
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:33,640
Honest to gosh,
there's nothing going on here.

414
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,583
- We know what's going on.

415
00:36:35,583 --> 00:36:38,920
- Please, don't make me do anything.

416
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:56,480
" Get out! Don't you understand
what she's doing? Can't you feel it?

417
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:59,040
Don't be stupid.

418
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,960
If we can only discuss this, please.

419
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:01,870
- Get him!

420
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:03,480
- Watch it, Andy. Watch it.

421
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:07,720
Not the girl. Not the girl.

422
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,280
Help! Help!

423
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,880
Help me!

424
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,080
No, don't.

425
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,160
No, don't.

426
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,680
No! Don't!

427
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,160
Now, get out of here.

428
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:51,280
She's never done anything like this
before. I don't know if she can stop.

429
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,240
Get out. Get out.

430
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,360
Go! Go!

431
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,640
Help me!

432
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,800
- Let's go!
- Don't leave me!

433
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,520
Charlie.

434
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,520
Stop it. That's enough.

435
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:40,120
Charlie! Charlie! Charlie!

436
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,200
Sorry, Daddy.

437
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,360
Let's get outta here, back to The Shop.

438
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,760
Go, go, go!

439
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,320
Oh, my God.

440
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,600
Andy. There's an old Willy's Jeep
out behind the barn.

441
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,720
No, Irv, don't get involved any deeper.

442
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:20,000
Those men came here
without any warrants,

443
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:24,080
tried to take them off our land,
one of them shot me.

444
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:27,320
What do you want me to do?
Turn them over to the secret police?

445
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:31,600
They'll be getting their peckers up enough
to come back. Be a good Nazi?

446
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:36,400
- I guess not.
- You don't have to do anything else.

447
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:39,760
No, please, take the Jeep and get away.

448
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,840
Just get away.

449
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,240
Charlie.

450
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,117
There's the lake. We're here.

451
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,720
Come on, Charlie.

452
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:21,160
We got a lot of cleaning up to do.

453
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,920
Nobody's lived here
since your grandfather died.

454
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,800
I hope that key's still here.

Shared and uploaded by:
Todi

456
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:46,800
Do you think they'll find us here?

457
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:52,120
After what you did at the farm,
I think they're gonna stay pretty far away.

458
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,280
If they still wanna capture us,

459
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:58,640
they're gonna have to figure out
a different way to do it.

460
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:01,920
Well, anyways, we've got us a new home.

461
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,880
Let's go. Let's go.

462
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,560
Don't it look good?

463
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:13,160
Daddy, will things
ever be the same for us again?

464
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,000
Will I be able to go to school,
and things, again?

465
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:19,400
Sure you can.

466
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:24,360
- After you write the letters, right?
- That's right.

467
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:27,200
Tell the newspapers all about it.

468
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:30,240
Then the running'll be over.

469
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:34,120
We'll live normal lives,
like everybody else.

470
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:40,443
- Can I be...?

471
00:42:40,443 --> 00:42:42,040
- What?

472
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:46,400
- Like everybody else?
- Darn tootin' you can.

473
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:51,200
I wanna be.

474
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,520
Look who's here.

475
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,623
- How'd you feel?

476
00:43:04,623 --> 00:43:06,240
- Safe.

477
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:12,360
- Good night, sweetheart.
- Good night, Daddy.

478
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,640
Do you have a phone here?

479
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:18,720
Right over here.

480
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:30,200
<i>- They're here. They mailed some letters.
- All right, good deal.</i>

481
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:34,160
Get a hold of Bates. He can be there
in an hour and keep me informed.

482
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:36,200
- Mr McGee?
- And Miss McGee.

483
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:39,200
- Where are they?
- The summer cottage near Bradford.

484
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:42,080
- I'll bring them here.
- Oh, just like that?

485
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:45,520
- You know what that little girl can do.
- I know.

486
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:49,040
That's why I'll bring her here.
So you can do all your tests.

487
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:54,640
On the condition that you give her to me
for disposal when you're finished with her.

488
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:56,840
What?

489
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,745
- I want her when you've finished with her.

490
00:44:59,745 --> 00:45:01,320
- You are mad.

491
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:05,640
How right you are.
So are you, mad as a hatter.

492
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:10,080
You sit here making plans for controlling a
force that's beyond your comprehension.

493
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,560
A force that belongs
only to the gods themselves.

494
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:14,960
What the hell are you talking about?

495
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:18,920
Things I'm sure
you wouldn't want the world to know.

496
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:24,640
What's to stop me from
having you erased right here and now?

497
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:25,720
Hmm!

498
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:31,720
My word that I've already made certain
provisions that, should I disappear,

499
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:34,640
The Shop will cease to exist
within six weeks.

500
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:37,800
And within six months,
you will stand in front of a judge,

501
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,311
awaiting sentence for crimes
serious enough to keep you behind bars

502
00:45:40,492 --> 00:45:44,720
for the rest of your life.

503
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:59,920
Just... what is it you want?

504
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:03,640
Your word that my involvement
with this child Charlene

505
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,560
will not end when I bring her here.

506
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,440
That's just the beginning.
We're going to be friends.

507
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:11,360
- We haven't got her yet.
- We'll have her.

508
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,320
All right.

509
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:21,640
I guess we've got a deal,
but why do you want her?

510
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:28,400
She's very beautiful. She's very young.
Yet inside her is the power of the gods.

511
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:31,440
We're going to be close, she and I.

512
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:35,000
Oh, yes.
Gonna be very close.

513
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:43,440
Reel in some of the slack out of the line.
Real slow, come on in, a little more.

514
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:47,000
OK, now give it a little tug.
Attagirl, now reel.

515
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:50,120
Yes, sirree! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

516
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:53,000
- A real whopper.
- Lookee here. How about that?

517
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:14,560
Here he comes.

518
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:23,680
Saved by the Postal Department.
Am I glad to see you?

519
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:26,680
I think we got a dead battery.
Could you give us a jump?

520
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,920
- Let's take a look at it.
- Thanks a lot, I really appreciate it.

521
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:33,800
Where will we go now?

522
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,080
Offices of "The New York Times. "

523
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:41,480
- But you sent them a letter.
- Well, they might not have gotten it.

524
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:43,880
Do you think they took them?

525
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,960
No!

526
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:07,680
- I'll get it, baby.
- " I can do it!

527
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:13,320
Baby, baby, come on, now.
It's almost over.

528
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:15,400
" It's never gonna be over.

529
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,280
- It's not over.
- Come on.

530
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:22,120
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is. Come here.

531
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,920
- Are you ready to go?
- I guess so.

532
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:34,720
Daddy, I'm never gonna start
another fire in my life.

533
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:37,840
Even if they come
before we can get away.

534
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:41,720
I'm never gonna hurt
another person in my life.

535
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:45,920
That's OK, Charlie. I can understand that.

536
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:48,840
OK.

537
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,160
Jump.

538
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:52,240
That's a big girl.

539
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:12,400
OK...

540
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:45,520
Charlie? Charlie! Charlie!

541
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:54,040
Oh God, oh God, oh God, oh God!

542
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:56,680
They shot my daughter! "

543
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:00,760
Come on out where I can see you,
you son of a bitch.

544
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:03,800
Baby.

545
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,720
Nothing to it.

546
00:52:58,720 --> 00:52:59,880
Charlie!

547
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,600
She's all right, Mr McGee. Take it easy.

548
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:13,320
Where is she? I wanna see her.

549
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:17,040
All in good time. First, let's talk.

550
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:19,560
Let's get acquainted.

551
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:22,640
Go to hell.

552
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:26,400
I tell you, she's gonna be all right.

553
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:35,480
No. No.

554
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:54,840
- What do you want with us?
- I told you, Mr McGee.

555
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:58,400
We are going to be spending
considerable time with each other

556
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:01,360
and I want to introduce myself.

557
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:03,800
I'm Dr Pynchot.

558
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:07,920
I'm going to make sure
you're treated well here.

559
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:15,680
Is this The Shop?

560
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:19,200
This is The Shop.

561
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,160
Hi, Charlene.

562
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:06,291
- I'm Captain Hollister. May I come in?

563
00:55:06,766 --> 00:55:08,160
- Where's my daddy?

564
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:13,360
I brought you some cocoa.

565
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:23,760
I don't want anything.

566
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:27,040
There's nothing to be afraid of. Here.

567
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:30,760
You see? Go on.

568
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:35,400
Well, maybe later.

569
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:41,600
I've been looking forward
to meeting you for a long time.

570
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:46,920
I know you may not believe this
but I've actually begun to think of you

571
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:48,800
as my own daughter.

572
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:51,377
- What have you done to my father?
- He's resting and he's fine, just like you.

573
00:55:51,377 --> 00:55:53,600
- He's resting and he's fine, just like you.

574
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:56,080
He knows you're all right
and he sends his love

575
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:58,120
and he wants you to cooperate with us.

576
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:00,360
You're a liar.

577
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:03,240
What kind of talk is that
from a nice little girl like you?

578
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:06,280
- Go to hell!
- Oh?

579
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:11,280
A very stubborn nice little girl.
That's all right, I understand.

580
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:14,120
I know you're tired
and you're not sure where you are.

581
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:19,320
So I just want to ease your mind, Charlie.
Do you mind if I call you Charlie?

582
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,360
All right, - Charlie

583
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:27,440
You are here because I'm very interested
in this ability that you have.

584
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:29,440
Pyrokinesis.

585
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:30,640
Yes.

586
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:35,440
All of us here are interested in that and
we want to see how far you can take it.

587
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:37,320
I'll tell you this, Charlie,

588
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:41,040
you'll be doing this great country of ours
a big favour if you cooperate.

589
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:47,000
I said I would never start another fire
in my life. I wanna see my father.

590
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,560
OK.

591
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:52,640
Um...

592
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:55,440
Why don't you drink the cocoa
and get some sleep?

593
00:56:55,560 --> 00:57:01,120
If there's anything you want,
just pick up the phone and let us know.

594
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:04,720
I know you'll find this
hard to believe now, Charlie, but...

595
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:07,000
you and me are gonna be pals.

596
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:08,560
Never.

597
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:12,480
Never say never.

598
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:14,560
I'll see you, Charlie.

599
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:19,640
Good night, Charlie.

600
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,600
Just back off. Back off.

601
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:41,000
No!

602
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:43,080
You're not gonna do it.

603
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:46,680
Back off!

604
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:55,520
<i>Come on, take these pills.</i>

605
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:57,600
Come on, swallow.

606
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:07,680
- Now we have So Red So Beautiful.
- Look what I have here.

607
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:10,160
A wind-up cat doll.

608
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:13,960
Listen to that, sweetheart.
Isn't that pretty?

609
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:15,040
Huh?

610
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:17,120
Sure you want this...

611
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:11,680
Hi, kid.

612
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:28,120
You go ahead with your game.
I'll start in the bedroom.

613
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:37,920
My name's John.

614
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,840
They call you Charlie, don't they?

615
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:46,760
Hey...

616
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:48,760
Hey...

617
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:53,280
You wanna teach me? I'm terrible
at games. You can beat me all the time.

618
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:54,360
No.

619
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:02,360
Where's Charlie?
What are you doing with her?

620
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:05,720
She's perfectly all right.
There's nothing to worry about.

621
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:07,911
- Yeah, well, I wanna see her, goddamn it.

622
01:00:07,911 --> 01:00:10,080
- Just behave yourself.

623
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:12,960
Do as we ask, we'll see.

624
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:16,920
You bastards.

625
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:19,600
Are you gonna do the test or not?

626
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:23,200
Oh, sure. Well, sure.

627
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:26,080
Good deal.

628
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:31,480
It's a one-way glass.
You won't see us but we'll see you.

629
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:47,880
All right, send him in.

630
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:55,640
<i>- Hi, how are you?
- Having the time of my life. Sit down.</i>

631
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:04,640
Did they tell you anything about what
we're supposed to be doing in here?

632
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:07,920
All they told me was to come talk to you.

633
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:13,640
You look nervous.
Thirsty? Want some water?

634
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:16,200
Yeah, I'm thirsty.

635
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:21,200
You know,
they mentioned something about a test.

636
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:23,480
- Uh-huh.
- You want some water?

637
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:25,560
No, I'll pass.

638
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:53,560
Why don't you put some ink in it?

639
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:04,920
<i>Put ink in it?</i>

640
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:06,960
You gotta be crazy.

641
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:13,040
- Goddamn it.
- He's tipped over.

642
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:15,200
He's been on the run too long.

643
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:17,797
- All those damn pills haven't helped.

644
01:02:17,797 --> 01:02:18,400
- Just give me time.

645
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:21,880
Rainbird's right.
He's lost it and time won't help.

646
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:27,080
Increase his medication.
I'll decide what to do with him later.

647
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:30,200
- Work on the girl.
- Oh, I am.

648
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:34,480
With a little luck, before long,
she'll trust me like a brother.

649
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:09,360
Hi, kid, how are you doing?

650
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:14,520
Why do you come here every day?
I'm not messy.

651
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:18,280
It's just my job, kid.

652
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:25,320
Because they're all full of shit. Why else?

653
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:31,040
I wanna see my father.

654
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:33,640
Sure you do.

655
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:38,120
I wish I could help.
I don't even know where the man is.

656
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:41,000
This is a big place, Charlie.

657
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:47,880
They say they'll let me see him if I...
if I do something.

658
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,747
- And I don't want to.

659
01:03:49,747 --> 01:03:51,003
- " Well...

660
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:53,240
Can it be that bad,
what they want you to do?

661
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:57,760
I mean, if just by doing it,
you can get to see your old man.

662
01:03:57,880 --> 01:03:59,840
It is.

663
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:07,600
Storm's coming on. Sure hope
those lights don't go off altogether.

664
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:09,880
No, sir, I wouldn't like that.

665
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:22,360
Hey...

666
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:24,080
Listen.

667
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:25,960
Are you scared by my face?

668
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:29,560
I mean,
I could wear a mask or something.

669
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:31,960
I've seen worse.

670
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:15,560
Kid! Kid, please!

671
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:18,760
I can't stand the dark. Please, kid.

672
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:21,920
Kid!

673
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:23,678
- I gotta get outta here. Help me.

674
01:05:23,756 --> 01:05:24,800
- Use your card.

675
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:28,760
All the electricity's gone. The card's
no good. Hey, let me outta here.

676
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:33,080
Hey! Let me out!

677
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:34,316
- What's the matter?

678
01:05:34,316 --> 01:05:36,480
- Let us out. There's people in here.

679
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:39,240
Stop it, we're OK.

680
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:41,840
I mean, aren't we?

681
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:46,240
Yeah, I guess you're right.

682
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:51,160
It's just... the dark. I can't stand it.

683
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:56,160
It's just like the place they put me
when I was captured.

684
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:57,812
- Who put you?

685
01:05:57,812 --> 01:06:00,640
- The Cong.

686
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:04,240
- Who's the Cong?
- You mean to tell me...?

687
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:07,680
Oh, no, of course not, you're too young.

688
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:10,400
It was the war, see. Vietnam.

689
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:15,760
The Cong were the bad guys.
They wore black pyjamas.

690
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:19,160
In the jungle we were on patrol.
Walked into an ambush.

691
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:21,160
Only about six of us got out.

692
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:23,840
We ran.

693
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:26,840
Went the wrong way.

694
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:29,120
They caught me.

695
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:32,360
Threw me in a hole in the ground.

696
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:36,360
Like being buried alive.
It was always dark like this.

697
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:38,480
What did you eat?

698
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:41,560
They threw down rotted rice.

699
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:44,720
Sometimes I'd eat spiders.

700
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:48,480
Live ones. Big spiders. I'd chase them
around in the dark and eat them.

701
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:50,520
Gross.

702
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:53,000
They turned me into an animal.

703
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:56,600
You got it easier than me, kid,
but it all comes down to the same thing.

704
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:59,000
Like a rat in the trap.

705
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:04,000
You think maybe they'll get
the lights back on pretty soon?

706
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:07,200
Doesn't matter. We're together.

707
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:13,920
God, kid. If some day I could help you
the way you're helping me...

708
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:19,080
You could.
You could get a message to my father.

709
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:23,800
You know, what's it all about? Why do
they have you and your daddy here?

710
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:25,440
What do they want you to do?

711
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:34,200
They won't make me take any more pills.

712
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:37,160
No more pills, you bastard.

713
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:43,200
How are you gonna help Charlie
if you're a goddamn zombie?

714
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:46,720
Listen,
maybe I could get in to see your dad?

715
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:50,840
- You could? You really think you could?
- I could change with Herbie, an orderly.

716
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:55,920
I could see your dad, tell him you're OK...
Maybe not tell him, pass him a note.

717
01:07:56,040 --> 01:08:00,280
- Oh, thank you, thank you.
- Shit.

718
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:03,280
Maybe you oughta light
the damn fires if you can.

719
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:07,640
I told you, it's like letting a wild animal
out of a cage.

720
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:11,920
I promised myself I'd never do it again.

721
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:17,560
That men at the airport, those men at
the farm, I killed them, I burned them up.

722
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:20,960
Yeah, but the way you told it,
it sounded like self-defence.

723
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:23,600
Yes, but that's no excuse.

724
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:27,160
Also sounded like you saved
your dad's life.

725
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:30,280
Look, if you do what they want you to do,

726
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:34,160
only as much as you want to do, it might
be the way for you to get out of here.

727
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:37,280
I'll help anyway I can.

728
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:40,080
Oh, my! Light.

729
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:42,160
Hold on here.

730
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:47,960
I'm sorry you got stuck with me
in here, John.

731
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:52,480
But I'm awful glad too.

732
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:56,960
You look like you could use
a little rest, huh? Come on, let's try.

733
01:08:57,080 --> 01:09:00,080
Attagirl.

734
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:02,160
There we go.

735
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:11,920
That's the girl.

736
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:21,640
You just relax
and you'll be asleep in no time.

737
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:27,960
And you'll have sweet, sweet dreams.

738
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:32,320
That's the girl.

739
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:42,520
- Good night, kid.
- Good night.

740
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:44,200
Daddy.

741
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:01,680
Now, Charlie, you know
what you're supposed to do.

742
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:07,080
I want you to go in the other room. I don't
want to have to look at you while I do this.

743
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:10,000
Something might happen.

744
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:35,200
Look at those alphas,
she's really jacked up.

745
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:38,720
Everything all set? Tape rolling?

746
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:44,240
- Everything all right with her?
- Yes.

747
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:48,840
- You all set in there?
- Ready in here.

748
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:53,040
Are we ready here? Tape rolling?

749
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:57,160
- Rolling.
- All right. Everyone stand by.

750
01:10:57,280 --> 01:10:59,240
Go ahead, Charlene.

751
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:18,600
Wood chips. They should've given me
something harder.

752
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:30,880
Something's happening in there.

753
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:36,360
Temperature just jumped ten degrees.

754
01:11:57,960 --> 01:11:59,280
There it goes.

755
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:04,560
Her alpha patterns
look like the goddamn Andes.

756
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:20,560
She did it. By God, she did it
and we got it all on tape.

757
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:26,320
Back off. Just back off.

758
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:29,240
Back off.

759
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:31,320
Look at the tub.

760
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:37,760
Back off.

761
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:47,280
Did you see the water boil?
And the temperature?

762
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:49,520
- Jesus, did we get the audio?
- We got it.

763
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:53,400
Good deal. My God, did you see
what she did? Did you see that?

764
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:58,352
My God, is there anyone here that has
any doubt she didn't make that happen?

765
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:00,040
Not at all, Chief. None.

766
01:13:00,160 --> 01:13:02,600
I knew something would happen
but I had no idea.

767
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:06,440
That tray flew and she controlled it.
Then she put her power in the tub.

768
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:09,440
We got all on tape
and it's good enough to stand up in court.

769
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:13,720
Right up in the Supreme Court.
What are you looking so miserable about?

770
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:17,440
You got her to do it by promising
she could see her father again.

771
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:21,520
- She must never see him.
- We never intended to let her.

772
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:27,280
She'll never stop asking for it. Suppose by
some strange accident they get together.

773
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:31,160
- Suppose they do.
- She does whatever he tells her.

774
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:36,000
Suppose he persuades her
to destroy us all.

775
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,140
- No chance.

776
01:13:40,140 --> 01:13:41,720
- There's always a chance.

777
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:45,480
He's right.
They can never see each other again.

778
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:48,080
Then you better send
somebody along after her.

779
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:49,200
Huh?

780
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:52,360
Your technician must've had
an appointment he forgot about.

781
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:55,880
He went out of here in a hell of a rush.
He also left the door open

782
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:59,000
and your firestarter just walked out.

783
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:04,880
Christ.
One of you men go and get her.

784
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:09,080
Go on.

785
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,240
Sure.

786
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:19,560
Which of you would like
to go and get the little girl?

787
01:14:58,240 --> 01:15:00,840
<i>Andy?</i>

788
01:15:03,720 --> 01:15:05,680
Here you go, buddy.

789
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:09,520
Oh, good.

790
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:26,560
Listen, Andy,

791
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:30,920
we've determined that your power
has deteriorated since you got here.

792
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:34,640
In fact, we've had no positive results at all.

793
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:39,400
What do you expect with all these drugs?

794
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:42,280
You expect me to do my best
when I'm stoned?

795
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:47,080
I did everything I could. I tried.
I did everything I could.

796
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:51,000
Yes, of course I know that you have
and believe me, I appreciate it very much.

797
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:53,280
In fact, I think you need a rest.

798
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:58,480
Did you know that The Shop has a small
compound on the island of Maui, Hawaii?

799
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:02,360
How would it be if I sent you there
for the immediate future?

800
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:06,600
- I still get my medication?
- Oh, sure, all you need.

801
01:16:08,240 --> 01:16:12,080
- Well, that sounds nice.
- All right, good deal.

802
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:16,360
Then I'll get things started
in that direction right away.

803
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:21,240
You just take it easy, kid.
We'll take care of everything.

804
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:08,240
She's so beautiful. What's her name?

805
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:12,360
" Actually, she's more of a boy.
His name is Necromancer.

806
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:15,200
What does necromancer mean?

807
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:19,720
I think it means something like wizard
or sorcerer. Something like that.

808
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:27,120
They said if I did what they wanted,
they'd let me see my father.

809
01:17:27,240 --> 01:17:31,960
How did I know they were gonna be so
damn stubborn? You have to do it again.

810
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:35,880
- But when will I ever stop?
- Look, baby.

811
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,720
It's like poker.

812
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:42,640
If you ain't dealing from strength,
you ain't dealing.

813
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:47,840
Every time you light one of their fires,
make sure you get something in return.

814
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:51,280
This is your old Uncle John talking,
you understand me?

815
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:52,760
OK.

816
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:56,600
What about this power of yours?
You were awful scared about it before.

817
01:17:56,720 --> 01:17:59,000
How'd you feel about it now?

818
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:02,920
It's different now. It's a lot stronger.

819
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:07,720
Yesterday, when I told it to back off, it did.

820
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:11,400
It was like I let it out
in a single straight line and then...

821
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:13,247
- Then you pulled it back into yourself?

822
01:18:13,247 --> 01:18:15,640
- Oh, no. I put it into the water.

823
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:20,040
If I pulled it back into myself,
I guess I'd burn up.

824
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:23,520
When am I gonna get to see my father?

825
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:26,960
Well, Charlie, we'll just have
to give them enough rope.

826
01:18:27,080 --> 01:18:30,160
Next time, there has to be more water.

827
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:47,360
Everything all set here?

828
01:18:48,338 --> 01:18:49,403
Tape running?

829
01:18:49,403 --> 01:18:50,012
All right, stand by.

830
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,960
We're ready when you are, Charlene.

831
01:19:50,760 --> 01:19:53,800
The temperature
should be -26 degrees Celsius.

832
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:57,680
Plus or minus five degrees.
It's 40 in there.

833
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:09,883
- The blocks are starting to burn.

834
01:20:10,679 --> 01:20:14,033
- Cinder blocks.

835
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:02,040
God.

836
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:10,400
Back off. Just back off.

837
01:21:14,280 --> 01:21:16,160
Back off. Just back off.

838
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:21,000
Back off.

839
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:49,652
I wanna see my father.

840
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:54,960
You better tell her something.

841
01:21:57,240 --> 01:21:59,880
Soon, Charlie.

842
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,480
When you show us a little more.

843
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:07,160
If you don't let me see him now,
I'll make something happen.

844
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:10,040
Do you hear me?
I'll make something happen.

845
01:22:21,160 --> 01:22:22,800
<i>Time for lunch.</i>

846
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:24,560
<i>Well, instant banquet.</i>

847
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:29,320
<i>Nice, table companion.</i>

848
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,560
I'm telling you, we're not through
with testing her.

849
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:52,160
You saw what she's capable of.
She hasn't even reached her potential.

850
01:22:52,280 --> 01:22:56,640
Perhaps Herman would like to see her
blow up a country before he gives in.

851
01:22:56,760 --> 01:22:59,680
I'm scientifically rational enough
not to form an opinion

852
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:03,040
based on two experiments.

853
01:23:03,160 --> 01:23:06,840
I'm satisfied, yes, but only partially.

854
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:11,480
Have you made the arrangements
regarding her father?

855
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:13,240
It's all taken care of.

856
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:19,400
Night, Doc.

857
01:23:31,880 --> 01:23:33,960
Rainbird.

858
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:36,040
Have you considered what might happen

859
01:23:36,160 --> 01:23:38,720
if that girl found out
whose side you're really on?

860
01:23:38,840 --> 01:23:41,240
Oh, yes, I have.

861
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:46,880
I'd say you stand a good chance of finding
out what a steak feels like in a microwave.

862
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:51,320
Would you shed a bitter tear?

863
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:55,360
No.

864
01:23:55,480 --> 01:23:58,320
No point in lying to you about that.

865
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:04,200
When we find out
all we need to know from her...

866
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:07,200
When you give her to me.

867
01:24:16,160 --> 01:24:18,600
What are you gonna do with her?

868
01:24:20,280 --> 01:24:23,000
John the friendly orderly will come in.

869
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:27,120
He will greet her, talk to her,
get her to smile.

870
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:31,720
John the friendly orderly will make her
happy cos he's the only one who can.

871
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:37,760
When John feels that she has reached
the moment of her greatest happiness,

872
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:43,480
he will strike her across the bridge
of the nose, breaking it explosively,

873
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:48,080
and sending bone fragments
into her brain.

874
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:53,400
It'll be quick and he'll be
looking at her face at the time.

875
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:56,560
He will know her power.

876
01:24:59,080 --> 01:25:01,600
And when he dies,

877
01:25:01,720 --> 01:25:04,560
which I hope is very soon,

878
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:10,120
perhaps he can take that power with him
into the other world.

879
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:29,160
You are crazy.

880
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:39,600
" I've made all the arrangements
for you to go to Hawaii.

881
01:25:39,720 --> 01:25:42,570
- Good. When am I going?

882
01:25:42,570 --> 01:25:43,920
- Today.

883
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:47,280
- Today?
- Well, 8.00 this evening.

884
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:52,480
- How?
- First class comfort all the way.

885
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:54,960
I mean, what's taking me?

886
01:25:55,080 --> 01:25:57,840
You go from here
by helicopter to the base,

887
01:25:57,960 --> 01:26:01,640
then the rest of the way
by army transport plane.

888
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:04,960
Hmm.

889
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:09,440
- 8.00?
- 8.00.

890
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:18,920
You know, that could bite you.

891
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:22,520
- What?
- That snake you're holding.

892
01:26:29,560 --> 01:26:33,000
Christ, how did that get there?

893
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:36,360
I guess you just picked it up from a bush.

894
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:40,160
I want you to contact that helicopter pilot.

895
01:26:40,280 --> 01:26:42,080
No.

896
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:44,160
- Hey, guard.
- Shut up.

897
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:48,680
Contact the pilot
and tell him you'll be coming along.

898
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:50,840
I won't be coming along.

899
01:26:56,600 --> 01:26:59,040
Yes, of course I'm coming along.

900
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:11,240
- My daughter will be with us.
- Oh, no.

901
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:14,000
She can't come. She's far too dangerous.

902
01:27:14,120 --> 01:27:18,360
Oh, yeah? Well, who do you think
made her dangerous?

903
01:27:24,240 --> 01:27:27,400
My daughter is coming along.

904
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:30,560
I don't want you to contradict me again,
do you understand?

905
01:27:30,680 --> 01:27:32,640
Yes, of course.

906
01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:44,880
You contact the helicopter and let him
take us as far as the army plane.

907
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,920
There has to be a refuelling stop
between here and Hawaii.

908
01:27:48,040 --> 01:27:51,520
- We'll have to refuel in California.
- Yeah.

909
01:27:52,640 --> 01:27:54,320
OK.

910
01:27:54,440 --> 01:27:57,680
- Do you have paper and a pen?
- Sure.

911
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:00,960
Here you go.

912
01:28:02,200 --> 01:28:04,320
I'm gonna write something
to my daughter.

913
01:28:04,440 --> 01:28:08,080
- You're gonna take it to her.
- Yes, of course.

914
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:10,280
<i>Charlie, love.</i>

915
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:14,560
<i>First thing, when you finish reading this,
flush it down the toilet, OK?</i>

916
01:28:14,680 --> 01:28:17,880
<i>Second thing,
if everything goes the way I'm planning,</i>

917
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,400
<i>we're gonna be out of here tonight.</i>

918
01:28:20,520 --> 01:28:25,080
<i>Third thing,
I want you to be in the stables at 8.00.</i>

919
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:27,280
<i>I'll arrange for somebody to bring you.</i>

920
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:30,400
<i>I miss you, Charlie. I love you so much.</i>

921
01:28:33,160 --> 01:28:36,000
- John!
- Hi, baby.

922
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:42,040
- I have to talk to you.
- Yeah, what about?

923
01:28:42,160 --> 01:28:43,840
I'll tell you in the hall.

924
01:28:46,160 --> 01:28:48,440
- They listen here.
- Right.

925
01:28:51,680 --> 01:28:54,560
My daddy's found a way
for us to get out of here.

926
01:28:54,680 --> 01:28:58,120
I'm supposed to meet him
at the stables at 8.00 tonight.

927
01:28:58,240 --> 01:29:00,049
- That's great. How did he do it?

928
01:29:00,049 --> 01:29:01,890
- I don't know, but isn't it wonderful?

929
01:29:01,960 --> 01:29:04,080
Better. It's a miracle. I'll take you.

930
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:08,600
No, you'd get in trouble.
I wouldn't do that to you. You're my friend.

931
01:29:11,120 --> 01:29:14,840
I appreciate that, Charlie,
but I'd do anything for you.

932
01:29:16,360 --> 01:29:18,560
Hi, Charlie.

933
01:29:22,040 --> 01:29:27,040
My name's Mike. Captain Hollister has
assigned me to take you to the stables.

934
01:29:27,160 --> 01:29:30,360
- What time?
- Well, let's see.

935
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:33,920
I'll be back for you
about quarter to eight this evening.

936
01:29:34,040 --> 01:29:37,160
So, what's going on?

937
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:39,602
- I asked if I could go riding at night-time.

938
01:29:39,602 --> 01:29:40,720
- Oh?

939
01:29:40,840 --> 01:29:43,920
Sure, kid, anything you want.

940
01:29:44,040 --> 01:29:46,320
- Bye.
- See you later.

941
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:04,440
Come to me, Charlie.

942
01:31:13,560 --> 01:31:16,080
OK, let's check you in here.

943
01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:24,200
Hey!

944
01:31:24,320 --> 01:31:26,440
Anybody here?

945
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:27,835
- You can go now.

946
01:31:27,835 --> 01:31:29,480
- I have the kid with me.

947
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,920
I said you can go now!

948
01:31:35,560 --> 01:31:40,800
- Get out of here.
- Can't do it, Charlie.

949
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:48,280
Back off. Back off.

950
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:56,000
Get out of here, you bastard,
or I'll burn you up, I'll fry you.

951
01:32:01,840 --> 01:32:03,760
Charlie.

952
01:32:03,880 --> 01:32:05,840
Charlie.

953
01:32:05,960 --> 01:32:08,560
John? John?

954
01:32:08,680 --> 01:32:11,800
- Where are you?
- I'm up here.

955
01:32:13,880 --> 01:32:15,840
John...

956
01:32:17,560 --> 01:32:22,960
I'm really glad you're here
but if anybody found out...

957
01:32:23,080 --> 01:32:27,520
That doesn't matter any more.
The only thing that matters is you and me.

958
01:32:27,640 --> 01:32:29,920
How'd you get Charlie to cooperate?

959
01:32:30,040 --> 01:32:31,938
- Rainbird got her to do it.

960
01:32:31,938 --> 01:32:32,920
- Who's Rainbird?

961
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:35,400
He's an agent, an exterminator..

962
01:32:35,400 --> 01:32:37,720
Charlene thinks he's an orderly named John

963
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:41,480
Come on up, Charlie. Come to John.

964
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:44,640
- My father should be here any minute.
- I know.

965
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:47,920
Hurry. Climb up now. Come to John.

966
01:32:49,880 --> 01:32:52,040
That's it. Come on.

967
01:32:52,160 --> 01:32:53,960
Good.

968
01:32:54,080 --> 01:32:57,280
Good girl. Right...

969
01:32:57,400 --> 01:32:59,480
- " Are you armed?
- " Yes.

970
01:33:00,440 --> 01:33:03,280
- Charlie?
- Daddy!

971
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:19,720
Yeah. Oh.

972
01:33:21,480 --> 01:33:25,120
- Let me look at you.
- Is it true? Are we really going away?

973
01:33:25,240 --> 01:33:29,480
Yes, it's true, we're really going away.

974
01:33:30,680 --> 01:33:32,640
Baby.

975
01:33:33,560 --> 01:33:37,080
- You pushed him.
- You're right.

976
01:33:38,160 --> 01:33:42,800
- My friend John is here.
- The orderly?

977
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:46,800
Yeah, he's up there.

978
01:33:46,920 --> 01:33:50,760
Couldn't we take him with us
if he wants to come?

979
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:56,840
He's the one that shot us, baby.
He's the one that brought us here.

980
01:33:56,960 --> 01:34:00,000
Oh, no, Daddy, that's John.
He took care of my room.

981
01:34:00,120 --> 01:34:02,080
No.

982
01:34:02,200 --> 01:34:04,160
He is with them.

983
01:34:14,320 --> 01:34:16,156
- It isn't true, is it?

984
01:34:16,156 --> 01:34:16,920
- Yes, it's true.

985
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:22,400
- Where are you, you son of a bitch?
- You tricked me, you lied to me.

986
01:34:22,520 --> 01:34:28,560
No, I just mixed up the truth a little,
Charlie. And I did it to save your life.

987
01:34:28,680 --> 01:34:33,000
You come down here before I set
everything on fire, cos I can do it.

988
01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:35,160
I know you can.

989
01:34:35,280 --> 01:34:38,240
But if you do, you're gonna burn up
an awful lot of horses.

990
01:34:38,360 --> 01:34:39,496
Can't you hear them?

991
01:34:39,496 --> 01:34:42,343
Necromancer's in one of those stalls.

992
01:34:48,360 --> 01:34:50,320
No, I'm not gonna do it.

993
01:34:53,280 --> 01:34:56,280
No, I'm not gonna do it.
I'm not gonna burn.

994
01:34:57,720 --> 01:34:59,760
No! Back off.

995
01:35:08,440 --> 01:35:11,040
Please, don't. Back off.

996
01:35:16,040 --> 01:35:17,880
You're not gonna do it.

997
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,840
Don't. Back off. Back off!

998
01:35:24,560 --> 01:35:28,960
What more do you want from us?
Why can't you just let us go?

999
01:35:29,080 --> 01:35:31,037
You can't just be let go.

1000
01:35:31,037 --> 01:35:34,160
I don't think your father even believes that now.

1001
01:35:34,280 --> 01:35:37,640
- You're dangerous and you know it.
- That's not my fault.

1002
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:42,160
I know that. I don't care about that.
I never did. All I care about is you.

1003
01:35:42,280 --> 01:35:46,160
Now, come up here!
Don't make me shoot your father.

1004
01:35:46,280 --> 01:35:50,120
- Don't listen to him, Charlie.
- You promise he'll be all right?

1005
01:35:50,240 --> 01:35:54,400
- I give you my real word.
- Don't do it, baby.

1006
01:35:54,520 --> 01:35:56,760
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

1007
01:36:06,920 --> 01:36:09,000
Kill him.

1008
01:36:28,440 --> 01:36:30,160
Jump.

1009
01:36:31,120 --> 01:36:33,080
No.

1010
01:36:36,520 --> 01:36:37,760
No!

1011
01:36:37,880 --> 01:36:40,560
Oh, Daddy! Are you hurt?

1012
01:36:40,680 --> 01:36:43,720
- Charlie...
- Daddy! Daddy!

1013
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:47,120
- You're bleeding.
- Charlie!

1014
01:36:48,680 --> 01:36:49,680
Daddy!

1015
01:36:51,320 --> 01:36:53,230
- Look at me.

1016
01:36:53,230 --> 01:36:55,514
- Go on.

1017
01:36:57,520 --> 01:36:59,880
Charlie, look at me.

1018
01:37:01,920 --> 01:37:05,000
That's it. So I can see your eyes.

1019
01:37:09,280 --> 01:37:10,720
I love you, Charlie.

1020
01:37:21,720 --> 01:37:23,680
I love you.

1021
01:37:29,200 --> 01:37:33,000
<i>I say again, Condition
Bright Yellow. This is not a drill.</i>

1022
01:37:33,120 --> 01:37:35,280
<i>Repeat, not a drill.</i>

1023
01:37:35,400 --> 01:37:40,080
<i>Converge on stables. Use caution.
It's the girl and she's using it.</i>

1024
01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:44,960
You gotta get away if you can, Charlie.

1025
01:37:45,080 --> 01:37:50,720
If you have to kill anybody that gets
in your way, I want you to do it.

1026
01:37:50,840 --> 01:37:55,160
You let them know that this is a war,
Charlie.

1027
01:37:55,280 --> 01:37:58,400
You have to get out of here.

1028
01:37:58,520 --> 01:38:01,080
Do it for me.

1029
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:07,200
Do it for me, baby, do you understand?

1030
01:38:07,320 --> 01:38:13,080
You make it. You make it so they can't
ever do anything like this again.

1031
01:38:16,240 --> 01:38:19,360
You'll have to burn it all down, baby.

1032
01:38:19,480 --> 01:38:21,440
Burn it all down.

1033
01:38:23,240 --> 01:38:25,200
Daddy...

1034
01:38:29,560 --> 01:38:33,840
Go on. Get outta here
before it all goes up.

1035
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:43,160
I can't leave you.

1036
01:38:44,240 --> 01:38:46,280
I can't leave you, Daddy.

1037
01:38:49,760 --> 01:38:51,720
Oh...

1038
01:38:52,480 --> 01:38:54,440
I love you, Charlie...

1039
01:38:58,400 --> 01:39:00,720
Oh, no, Daddy.

1040
01:39:14,120 --> 01:39:17,720
Get the door. Ready?

1041
01:39:23,080 --> 01:39:25,000
- Don't move.
- Freeze.

1042
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,520
Oh, my God!

1043
01:39:59,640 --> 01:40:02,760
Get her! Get her!

1044
01:40:23,800 --> 01:40:25,760
- Run! Run for it!
- Let's go!

1045
01:40:56,480 --> 01:41:00,600
Come on, let's get out of here.

1046
01:41:48,680 --> 01:41:50,640
No! No!

1047
01:42:09,240 --> 01:42:10,960
Take cover!

1048
01:42:13,720 --> 01:42:15,480
Take cover!

1049
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:05,280
No... Stop!

1050
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:09,720
No! No!

1051
01:43:09,840 --> 01:43:11,440
No! No!

1052
01:43:21,880 --> 01:43:23,600
<i>Attention!</i>

1053
01:43:24,760 --> 01:43:27,000
<i>Stay right where you are.</i>

1054
01:43:34,920 --> 01:43:38,160
<i>Do not move. We're coming down.</i>

1055
01:45:03,480 --> 01:45:05,920
For you, Daddy.

1056
01:45:21,640 --> 01:45:26,120
- Irv, look who's here.
- Thanks for the ride.

1057
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,320
" You'll be safe now, Charlie.

1058
01:46:15,520 --> 01:46:17,560
I'm doing it, Daddy.

1059
01:46:17,680 --> 01:46:19,640
I love you.
