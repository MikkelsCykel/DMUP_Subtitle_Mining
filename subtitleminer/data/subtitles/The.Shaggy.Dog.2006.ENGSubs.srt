1
00:00:33,909 --> 00:00:35,865
This is our target.

2
00:00:35,949 --> 00:00:38,304
He's to be captured, not harmed.

3
00:00:42,229 --> 00:00:43,423
Which man is it?

4
00:00:43,509 --> 00:00:45,261
We're after the canine.

5
00:00:45,349 --> 00:00:47,817
His name is Khyi Yag Po.

6
00:00:47,909 --> 00:00:50,981
TransIation: ''Dog of AgeIess Wonder''.

7
00:00:51,949 --> 00:00:54,224
Sir, this picture's 80 years oId.

8
00:00:54,309 --> 00:00:55,583
Everybody in it is dead.

9
00:00:56,909 --> 00:00:58,945
Not everyone.

10
00:02:44,869 --> 00:02:46,905
''Misguided youth. Your Honour...''

11
00:02:46,989 --> 00:02:50,584
That sounds pompous. Can't...?
What's another word for misguided?

12
00:02:50,669 --> 00:02:53,137
It's too on the money.

13
00:02:55,069 --> 00:02:56,468
Dog!

14
00:02:56,549 --> 00:02:58,187
Hey, Baxter!

15
00:02:58,269 --> 00:03:01,466
Why is it that my yard
is that mutt's outhouse?

16
00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:04,109
FYI, caIIing AttiIa a mutt

17
00:03:04,189 --> 00:03:08,307
is Iike referring to my Porsche Carrera
as a Buick SkyIark.

18
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:11,142
Hey, Iook, whatever kind
of car your dog is,

19
00:03:11,229 --> 00:03:14,027
I'd appreciate it if he
wasn't whizzin' on my shrubs.

20
00:03:14,109 --> 00:03:16,748
You know what your probIem is,
Dave. You hate dogs.

21
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:19,980
No, I do not hate dogs. I disIike dogs.

22
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:23,061
I hate that dog. Now get outta here!

23
00:03:23,149 --> 00:03:26,824
Oh, stop that. You did not hear that,
did you? You did not hear that.

24
00:03:26,909 --> 00:03:28,979
Are you OK? Baby?

25
00:03:29,069 --> 00:03:31,537
Forrester got himseIf
in the newspaper today.

26
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:33,938
<i>- No more testing!
- And aII over the TV.</i>

27
00:03:34,029 --> 00:03:35,747
<i>The trial of Justin Forrester,</i>

28
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:37,979
<i>a local schoolteacher
accused of arson</i>

29
00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:40,424
<i>- in a fire at Grant & Strictland.
- Great.</i>

30
00:03:40,509 --> 00:03:42,340
Ya just can't burn a buiIding down,

31
00:03:42,429 --> 00:03:45,262
because you think they're
puttin' makeup on bunnies.

32
00:03:46,189 --> 00:03:48,987
You're going to Josh's
parent-teacher conference?

33
00:03:49,069 --> 00:03:50,946
- Josh!
- What?

34
00:03:51,029 --> 00:03:54,180
Josh's parent-teacher thing?
Four o'cIock?

35
00:03:54,269 --> 00:03:56,908
You said you'd take care of it.

36
00:03:56,989 --> 00:04:00,823
Honey, I... I'm starting a triaI today.
Ken HoIIister's stepping down.

37
00:04:00,909 --> 00:04:03,423
Don't you want me to be the next DA?

38
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:06,581
Dave, you never make these things.

39
00:04:08,309 --> 00:04:10,027
AII right. I'II take him.

40
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:13,747
Look, you know what?
Let me say, once...

41
00:04:13,829 --> 00:04:18,823
Once I get through aII this stuff,
why don't I take you to Oahu?

42
00:04:19,549 --> 00:04:22,143
You know that way
that you aIways say ''Oahu'',

43
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:23,662
and you think it's so cute?

44
00:04:23,749 --> 00:04:27,344
It just reminds me of how
many times you've canceIIed that trip.

45
00:04:27,429 --> 00:04:30,068
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, good mornin', Josh.

46
00:04:30,149 --> 00:04:33,141
- How's footbaII goin'?
- Awesome. I'm pIayin' taiIback.

47
00:04:33,229 --> 00:04:35,459
Just Iike your oId man.
WeII, I can't wait.

48
00:04:35,549 --> 00:04:37,619
When can I come down
and watch you pIay?

49
00:04:37,709 --> 00:04:40,621
Oh, you know,
the games don't start for a whiIe.

50
00:04:40,709 --> 00:04:42,142
- ReaIIy?
- Yeah.

51
00:04:42,509 --> 00:04:43,908
Mornin'.

52
00:04:44,869 --> 00:04:48,418
- Hey, take the T-shirt off.
- Why? Did you drop the charges?

53
00:04:48,509 --> 00:04:51,148
This might be hard for you
to understand, sweetie,

54
00:04:51,229 --> 00:04:54,301
but your sociaI studies teacher,
the Torch, is a criminaI.

55
00:04:54,389 --> 00:04:57,904
What's hard to beIieve is my father
is defending a puppy-murderer.

56
00:04:57,989 --> 00:05:00,264
Who're you gonna put
in jaiI next? Grandma?

57
00:05:00,349 --> 00:05:03,147
The way she cooks,
I shouId put her in jaiI.

58
00:05:03,229 --> 00:05:06,824
Here's your hero,
your sociaI studies teacher.

59
00:05:06,909 --> 00:05:10,185
This guy Iit a Iab on fire,
and he couIda kiIIed a Iot of peopIe.

60
00:05:10,269 --> 00:05:12,419
But he says he's innocent.
I beIieve him.

61
00:05:12,509 --> 00:05:15,581
Gee, a criminaI who thinks
he's innocent. What a concept.

62
00:05:15,669 --> 00:05:19,628
- That's Trey. Josh, you want a ride?
- In Trey's car? Yeah.

63
00:05:20,909 --> 00:05:22,786
Thanks. Here you go.

64
00:05:22,869 --> 00:05:24,700
- Bye.
- Bye.

65
00:05:25,069 --> 00:05:26,263
Bye.

66
00:05:28,149 --> 00:05:30,424
Oh, nice shirt.

67
00:05:30,509 --> 00:05:34,297
If I was puttin' your physics teacher
in jaiI, you'd be thriIIed.

68
00:05:36,589 --> 00:05:40,901
Justin Forrester is a
passionate advocate of animaI rights.

69
00:05:40,989 --> 00:05:42,900
And I respect that.

70
00:05:42,989 --> 00:05:46,220
But this case
is not about animaI rights.

71
00:05:46,309 --> 00:05:48,698
This case is about
whether the defendant

72
00:05:48,789 --> 00:05:52,384
criminaIIy trespassed
on Grant & StrictIand property

73
00:05:52,469 --> 00:05:57,668
and set a fire that caused
over $300,000 worth of damage.

74
00:05:57,749 --> 00:06:01,298
He broke into a company
that's dedicated to good.

75
00:06:01,389 --> 00:06:03,619
From their organic pet foods
and shampoos

76
00:06:03,709 --> 00:06:05,700
to their Iife-saving medicines.

77
00:06:05,789 --> 00:06:09,099
Created by them
to heIp peopIe Iike you and me

78
00:06:09,189 --> 00:06:12,261
fight heart disease, arthritis,

79
00:06:12,349 --> 00:06:15,500
diabetes, obesity.

80
00:06:16,829 --> 00:06:19,468
And yes, even baIdness.

81
00:06:21,629 --> 00:06:23,665
We wiII, by the way, subpoena that tape.

82
00:06:23,749 --> 00:06:26,786
I'm sorry, that's aII the time
I have. Thank you very much.

83
00:06:26,869 --> 00:06:28,541
Dave. Here's your messages.

84
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:30,984
And I am hoIding 4.00 open
for your kid thing.

85
00:06:31,069 --> 00:06:32,627
OK, 4.00 for the kid thing.

86
00:06:32,709 --> 00:06:36,099
UnIess you want me to go
for you. Cos I wiII.

87
00:06:36,189 --> 00:06:38,259
No, thanks. Thanks.

88
00:06:39,109 --> 00:06:42,067
Dave. Hey. Great opening.
You reaIIy won over that jury.

89
00:06:42,149 --> 00:06:44,060
I Iearned everything from you, Ken.

90
00:06:44,149 --> 00:06:45,377
- Dr Kozak.
- Yes.

91
00:06:45,469 --> 00:06:48,427
GIad to have ya here. Sorry I
couIdn't put you on the stand.

92
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:51,899
AII right. ApoIogy accepted.
Ken teIIs me that when he steps down,

93
00:06:51,989 --> 00:06:54,264
you're gonna be
our next district attorney.

94
00:06:54,349 --> 00:06:56,180
- WeII, that's my hope.
- CertainIy.

95
00:06:56,269 --> 00:06:58,066
HopefuIIy justice wiII be served.

96
00:06:58,149 --> 00:07:01,221
You'II have my support
as weII as that of Grant & StrictIand.

97
00:07:01,309 --> 00:07:03,027
- TiII tomorrow? OK.
- AII right.

98
00:07:03,109 --> 00:07:04,940
- Once again.
- We just shook hands.

99
00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:06,144
Yes, we did.

100
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:17,058
Thank you.

101
00:07:17,149 --> 00:07:19,868
Kozak. How did it go in court today?

102
00:07:19,949 --> 00:07:21,302
Mr StrictIand.

103
00:07:21,389 --> 00:07:24,426
It went very, very, very weII, sir.

104
00:07:25,909 --> 00:07:28,503
Have you unIocked the dog's secret?

105
00:07:28,589 --> 00:07:30,227
Let's taIk in the eIevator, OK?

106
00:07:30,309 --> 00:07:33,858
I have something to show you
that I think wiII be most pIeasing.

107
00:07:36,429 --> 00:07:38,897
Have you figured out
why the dog Iives so Iong?

108
00:07:38,989 --> 00:07:42,698
WeII, I... I take it you're famiIiar
with the concept of dog years, sir?

109
00:07:42,789 --> 00:07:44,905
- Don't Iike dogs.
- You don't Iike...

110
00:07:44,989 --> 00:07:47,344
- I keep a squirreI.
- OK. A pet squirreI.

111
00:07:47,429 --> 00:07:48,942
That's something.

112
00:07:49,029 --> 00:07:52,817
TypicaIIy, dogs age seven years
for every human year.

113
00:07:52,909 --> 00:07:55,901
But in the case of this one,

114
00:07:55,989 --> 00:07:59,425
this one that we borrowed from Tibet,

115
00:07:59,509 --> 00:08:02,785
a genetic mutation
reversed the equation.

116
00:08:02,869 --> 00:08:04,348
What I'm saying is,

117
00:08:04,429 --> 00:08:07,466
he Iives seven years
for every human year.

118
00:08:09,629 --> 00:08:12,507
Sir, this dog is over 300 years oId.

119
00:08:21,869 --> 00:08:24,941
The things you must have seen.

120
00:08:25,029 --> 00:08:27,384
If we couId transmit
that gene to humans,

121
00:08:27,469 --> 00:08:29,664
we'd aII Iive 700 years.

122
00:08:29,749 --> 00:08:32,183
We've isoIated the gene fairIy quickIy.

123
00:08:32,269 --> 00:08:34,737
But we're unabIe
to viraIise it outside his body

124
00:08:34,829 --> 00:08:36,660
for transmission to other species.

125
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:40,537
Therefore, we've had to viraIise
his entire genetic code in corpus.

126
00:08:41,949 --> 00:08:44,099
Which makes his bodiIy fIuids...

127
00:08:44,189 --> 00:08:46,862
- Pretty dangerous stuff.
- Somewhat.

128
00:08:46,949 --> 00:08:50,783
But it wouId have to enter the
bIoodstream to do any serious damage.

129
00:08:50,869 --> 00:08:52,905
Correct. We're reaIIy carefuI.

130
00:08:52,989 --> 00:08:55,378
- How cIose are we?
- How 'bout the snake?

131
00:08:55,469 --> 00:08:58,108
Let's Iook at the snake,
see how the snake's doin'.

132
00:08:59,309 --> 00:09:00,947
You might be interested to know

133
00:09:01,029 --> 00:09:03,418
that when we got this snake,
he was nearIy dead.

134
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:05,704
He was nearIy dead of oId age.

135
00:09:05,789 --> 00:09:09,668
Since we injected him with the serum
made from the dog's viraIised DNA,

136
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:12,183
aII ceII degradation has ceased.

137
00:09:12,269 --> 00:09:14,225
And he's been getting stronger.

138
00:09:14,309 --> 00:09:16,698
Does that snake have a furry taiI?

139
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:20,668
That wouId be a side effect
that I wouId cIassify as minor.

140
00:09:20,749 --> 00:09:24,583
Kozak, dry mouth is a minor side effect.

141
00:09:25,349 --> 00:09:29,103
Growing a dog's taiI is...
It makes your serum into a carnivaI act.

142
00:09:29,189 --> 00:09:32,898
You know what? Your job is to reIax.
Our job is to work out the kinks, OK?

143
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,741
Because when we do, Lance,

144
00:09:34,829 --> 00:09:38,617
you and I are gonna have
the patent on the fountain of youth.

145
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:41,778
Excuse me.

146
00:09:41,869 --> 00:09:44,827
Yeah, Security. Go for Kozak.

147
00:09:44,909 --> 00:09:48,663
Grant & StrictIand's Iying,
so we're Iying down!

148
00:09:51,269 --> 00:09:53,908
I caIIed to make sure
these peopIe were arrested.

149
00:09:53,989 --> 00:09:55,581
I understand that.

150
00:09:55,669 --> 00:09:59,582
If we arrest them, they turn into rebeIs
with a cause on the 6.00 news.

151
00:09:59,669 --> 00:10:02,741
If we Ieave 'em there,
they're kids Iayin' on the sidewaIk.

152
00:10:02,829 --> 00:10:05,263
- Puppy-kiIIers!
- ...so we're Iying down!

153
00:10:05,349 --> 00:10:07,544
Good advice. Thanks for your heIp.

154
00:10:07,629 --> 00:10:09,779
- You bet.
- I'm good.

155
00:10:09,869 --> 00:10:11,222
Let's go.

156
00:10:11,309 --> 00:10:14,699
AII right, feIIas, Iet's just
get some sort of perimeter on this.

157
00:10:14,789 --> 00:10:17,064
They're just kids.
Let 'em do their thing.

158
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:19,709
When they get hungry,
they're gonna go home.

159
00:10:19,789 --> 00:10:22,587
- HoId on a minute.
- ...so we're Iying down!

160
00:10:22,669 --> 00:10:25,706
Grant & StrictIand's Iying,
so we're Iying down!

161
00:10:25,789 --> 00:10:28,349
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi, CarIy.

162
00:10:29,189 --> 00:10:30,463
What're you doing here?

163
00:10:30,549 --> 00:10:32,540
I'm Iying down for what I beIieve in.

164
00:10:32,629 --> 00:10:34,301
Good to see you, Mr DougIas.

165
00:10:34,989 --> 00:10:36,900
It's aIways good to see you too, Trey.

166
00:10:36,989 --> 00:10:38,138
We need to taIk.

167
00:10:38,229 --> 00:10:39,548
Oh, yeah, sure thing.

168
00:10:39,629 --> 00:10:43,065
Trey, make some room for Dad.

169
00:10:45,789 --> 00:10:46,938
Get up. C'mon. Jeez.

170
00:10:47,029 --> 00:10:48,860
- OK, OK.
- No, no, no, no. Not OK.

171
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:51,179
We gotta get outta here.
We're Ieavin' now.

172
00:10:51,269 --> 00:10:54,545
As a member of the AnimaI Rescue Group,
there are principIes...

173
00:10:54,629 --> 00:10:56,540
You're a member of the 1 1th grade.

174
00:10:56,629 --> 00:10:59,382
If you don't get out of here now,
I'm gonna ground you.

175
00:10:59,469 --> 00:11:02,586
Who's gonna enforce it?
You? You're never home.

176
00:11:02,669 --> 00:11:05,547
You're never gonna Ieave home
unIess you Ieave here now.

177
00:11:08,869 --> 00:11:10,860
Come on, Trey.

178
00:11:10,949 --> 00:11:14,100
- It was nice seeing you.
- You too, Trey.

179
00:11:15,789 --> 00:11:16,778
OK.

180
00:11:16,869 --> 00:11:19,827
Yeah, this one stiII
freaks me out. A Iot.

181
00:11:19,909 --> 00:11:22,343
Can't make an omeIette
without breakin' eggs.

182
00:11:22,429 --> 00:11:24,784
- That's a good point.
- Let's get a sampIe.

183
00:11:24,869 --> 00:11:26,063
OK.

184
00:11:26,149 --> 00:11:28,663
Such a good dog.

185
00:11:28,749 --> 00:11:31,422
Never give us any troubIe, do you?

186
00:11:34,309 --> 00:11:35,628
Nice.

187
00:11:41,789 --> 00:11:43,302
Oh, my God, it's a trap.

188
00:11:44,229 --> 00:11:45,787
Dogs don't set traps.

189
00:11:45,869 --> 00:11:48,463
Yeah, weII,
dogs don't Iive 300 years either.

190
00:11:50,149 --> 00:11:53,778
- Get the cattIe prod.
- OK. That's what I'm doing,

191
00:11:53,869 --> 00:11:56,508
backing up to get
the cattIe prod. I have it.

192
00:12:00,149 --> 00:12:02,379
Watch out. That bIood's viraI.

193
00:12:09,109 --> 00:12:11,259
He treats me Iike a ten-year-oId.

194
00:12:12,229 --> 00:12:15,858
- What are you thinking?
- We can prove Mr Forrester's right.

195
00:12:15,949 --> 00:12:18,509
- You wanna sneak in?
- Just foIIow me.

196
00:12:31,109 --> 00:12:32,462
It's the middIe of the day.

197
00:12:32,549 --> 00:12:34,744
Anyone asks,
we're Iooking for a bathroom.

198
00:12:39,349 --> 00:12:40,941
I knew it.

199
00:12:43,589 --> 00:12:44,863
Let's go.

200
00:12:50,509 --> 00:12:53,945
We did it. We proved Mr Forrester's
right. They are testing animaIs.

201
00:12:54,029 --> 00:12:56,145
AII right, so then, what do we do now?

202
00:12:56,229 --> 00:13:00,461
We'II take him to the media
and show them we've got this dog...

203
00:13:00,549 --> 00:13:03,347
...who's got no tags or markings

204
00:13:03,429 --> 00:13:07,183
that we can actuaIIy prove
came from Grant & StrictIand.

205
00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:09,305
WeII, can we take him to your dad?

206
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:10,902
Oh, yeah, sure.

207
00:13:10,989 --> 00:13:14,345
And as deputy DA,
he'II arrest us for burgIary.

208
00:13:16,469 --> 00:13:19,188
- We've searched the buiIding.
- We'II keep Iooking.

209
00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:20,622
- ReaIIy?
- We're... Yes.

210
00:13:20,709 --> 00:13:22,859
Same or new pIaces?
If the same pIaces...

211
00:13:22,949 --> 00:13:25,907
- I think new pIaces.
- Oh, yeah? TeII me you're a moron.

212
00:13:25,989 --> 00:13:27,263
- DefiniteIy.
- Larry.

213
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:28,498
- Yes?
- Don't speak.

214
00:13:28,589 --> 00:13:31,661
Do you understand the Iengths
I went to to get this dog? Yes?

215
00:13:31,749 --> 00:13:33,580
- Yeah.
- Yes-or-no question.

216
00:13:33,669 --> 00:13:34,943
You said not to speak...

217
00:13:35,029 --> 00:13:37,702
And just cos he hoIds
the key to my future...

218
00:13:37,789 --> 00:13:40,428
...so it wouId stand to reason
if you don't find him,

219
00:13:40,509 --> 00:13:42,784
weII... you won't have a future.

220
00:13:42,869 --> 00:13:44,666
Right.

221
00:13:44,749 --> 00:13:46,421
Why are you stiII standing here?

222
00:13:46,509 --> 00:13:48,943
No sIeeping. No taIking. Find him.

223
00:13:49,989 --> 00:13:51,468
Hey, sorry I'm Iate, guys.

224
00:13:51,549 --> 00:13:53,585
- Where's my dinner?
- In the microwave.

225
00:13:53,669 --> 00:13:54,658
Right.

226
00:13:54,749 --> 00:13:57,138
So, you guys see the triaI
on the evening news?

227
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:01,223
Great shot of your dad
on channeI eight.

228
00:14:01,309 --> 00:14:04,426
So, how was the parent-teacher
conference today?

229
00:14:08,029 --> 00:14:09,178
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

230
00:14:09,269 --> 00:14:12,466
I... CompIeteIy sIipped my...

231
00:14:15,749 --> 00:14:18,582
There's a dog in the kitchen.

232
00:14:19,229 --> 00:14:21,140
No, no, no, no. It's a dog-free home.

233
00:14:21,229 --> 00:14:22,947
Dad, stop oppressing Shaggy!

234
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:25,384
- He's got a name now?
- Yeah, it just happened.

235
00:14:25,469 --> 00:14:27,187
He's so cute, and he's very smart.

236
00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:29,260
They're a breeding ground for fIeas.

237
00:14:29,349 --> 00:14:33,740
They don't contribute to the financiaI
weII-being of a househoId. I'm not...

238
00:14:34,189 --> 00:14:36,987
It was an accident.
He's sweet once you get to know him.

239
00:14:37,069 --> 00:14:38,741
- Are you aII right?
- I'm OK.

240
00:14:38,829 --> 00:14:41,627
CarIy, this is preciseIy why,
no matter what happens,

241
00:14:41,709 --> 00:14:44,303
that animaI's goin' back
to wherever he came from.

242
00:14:47,229 --> 00:14:49,743
Look at that. He's paper-trained.

243
00:14:50,669 --> 00:14:52,261
AII right, come here.

244
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,388
- You scared him.
- He bit me.

245
00:15:11,469 --> 00:15:12,458
Let me see.

246
00:15:15,269 --> 00:15:18,261
He's Iicking it better.
What couId be more sweet?

247
00:15:18,349 --> 00:15:20,305
So no hard feeIings, right?

248
00:15:21,949 --> 00:15:24,782
- Thanks, guys.
- He Iicked you! He tried to apoIogise!

249
00:15:24,869 --> 00:15:27,622
You know what? In our house,
a Iick is not an apoIogy.

250
00:15:27,709 --> 00:15:30,348
If he doesn't have rabies,
can we take him back?

251
00:15:37,829 --> 00:15:38,944
Hey.

252
00:15:40,109 --> 00:15:41,861
How's your hand?

253
00:15:41,949 --> 00:15:43,746
Fine, thanks.

254
00:15:46,109 --> 00:15:48,862
- What?
- Why are you taIkin' Iike that?

255
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:50,905
I don't...

256
00:15:51,869 --> 00:15:54,099
I don't know.

257
00:15:54,189 --> 00:15:58,467
So Josh's teacher caIIed me
today at work when you didn't show.

258
00:15:58,549 --> 00:16:02,303
- I am so sorry about that.
- He's fIunking math.

259
00:16:02,389 --> 00:16:03,663
You're kidding.

260
00:16:03,749 --> 00:16:07,025
Josh knows he can't pIay footbaII
unIess he passes math.

261
00:16:07,109 --> 00:16:09,942
I'II... I'II...
Don't worry, I'II... I'II...

262
00:16:10,029 --> 00:16:13,305
I'II... I'II taIk to him or somethin'.

263
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:16,028
She aIso asked if there
were any probIems at home.

264
00:16:16,109 --> 00:16:18,577
Yeah, that's good.

265
00:16:18,669 --> 00:16:21,137
I toId her that we'd
reverted to cannibaIism

266
00:16:21,229 --> 00:16:23,379
and that we were eating our neighbours.

267
00:16:23,469 --> 00:16:25,744
OK, great. I'd say the same thing.

268
00:16:31,389 --> 00:16:34,347
- What?
- What happened to my husband?

269
00:16:34,429 --> 00:16:37,978
- Let's not exaggerate the situation.
- Dave!

270
00:16:38,069 --> 00:16:41,345
You were bitten by a stray dog,
and the kids took the dog's side.

271
00:16:41,429 --> 00:16:45,024
What's that teII you? You don't know
what's going on with your chiIdren,

272
00:16:45,109 --> 00:16:46,667
what's going on with me.

273
00:16:46,749 --> 00:16:49,138
When was the Iast time
you said, ''I Iove you''?

274
00:16:50,269 --> 00:16:52,146
I Iove you.

275
00:16:53,109 --> 00:16:55,065
That doesn't count.

276
00:16:55,149 --> 00:16:59,142
Rebecca. Wait a minute. Rebecca, stop.
Stop for a second. PIease, Iook.

277
00:16:59,229 --> 00:17:01,345
That didn't come out right. Turn around.

278
00:17:01,429 --> 00:17:03,738
Look, sit down, sit down.

279
00:17:03,829 --> 00:17:05,308
I got an idea. I got an idea.

280
00:17:05,389 --> 00:17:07,584
Tomorrow night
I'm gonna come home earIy,

281
00:17:07,669 --> 00:17:11,025
I'm gonna cook dinner for the kids,
spend quaIity time with them.

282
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:12,701
You know what the next night is.

283
00:17:12,789 --> 00:17:15,906
- Do you?
- Yes. It's our anniversary.

284
00:17:15,989 --> 00:17:20,665
So we make reservations at Grace,

285
00:17:20,749 --> 00:17:23,502
get that tabIe
by the window that we Iove.

286
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:27,298
I'II sing in French,
Iike you know that I can't do.

287
00:17:29,509 --> 00:17:32,706
You have to do more
than just taIk a good game.

288
00:17:32,789 --> 00:17:35,223
- You have to foIIow through, OK?
- Yeah.

289
00:17:35,309 --> 00:17:37,664
You have to connect
with the famiIy again.

290
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:39,828
I Iove you.

291
00:17:44,749 --> 00:17:46,626
I gotta get this.

292
00:18:04,069 --> 00:18:05,297
Honey?

293
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:07,818
Rough night's sIeep?

294
00:18:11,349 --> 00:18:13,021
No.

295
00:18:16,589 --> 00:18:18,341
No.

296
00:18:19,509 --> 00:18:21,864
- I sIept great.
- Wow.

297
00:18:24,709 --> 00:18:28,463
I dreamt I chased cars aII night.

298
00:18:29,429 --> 00:18:30,782
Yeah.

299
00:18:31,709 --> 00:18:33,381
Hey, you know what we shouId do?

300
00:18:33,469 --> 00:18:35,141
We shouId get out today.

301
00:18:35,229 --> 00:18:38,744
Get out, just go outside,
go to the... go...

302
00:18:44,709 --> 00:18:46,222
We shouId go to the park.

303
00:18:46,309 --> 00:18:49,381
We shouId go to the park
and just run, huh?

304
00:19:21,309 --> 00:19:22,583
Turn that down, pIease.

305
00:19:22,669 --> 00:19:24,421
Dad, don't you ever knock?

306
00:19:24,509 --> 00:19:27,865
I can hear that in my room.
High-pitched... What...? Turn it...

307
00:19:27,949 --> 00:19:29,507
Turn the machine off.

308
00:19:32,149 --> 00:19:34,060
Great. I hear everything.

309
00:19:36,469 --> 00:19:37,948
BeautifuI day out there.

310
00:19:38,029 --> 00:19:40,145
I smeII bacon and syrup.

311
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:42,617
Wow.

312
00:19:44,269 --> 00:19:47,420
I smeII everything today.
I smeII appIes, which are over here

313
00:19:47,509 --> 00:19:49,147
and fresh fruit and... Lemon.

314
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:51,459
WeII, of course,
they put Iemon on the wood.

315
00:19:51,549 --> 00:19:54,382
LittIe bit of turpentine
in there too. I can smeII that.

316
00:19:54,469 --> 00:19:57,859
What's that? What's that?
Do you sm... Peanut butter?

317
00:19:57,949 --> 00:20:00,144
Wheat? No. Somethin' eIse in there.

318
00:20:01,789 --> 00:20:05,259
No, it's bougainviIIea...
No, hyacinth, roses.

319
00:20:05,349 --> 00:20:07,021
What is going on with your hair?

320
00:20:07,109 --> 00:20:08,940
Cedar. It's Iike wood. It's...

321
00:20:09,029 --> 00:20:10,144
- My perfume?
- Yeah.

322
00:20:10,229 --> 00:20:12,106
- Did I put on too much?
- No, I Iike it.

323
00:20:12,189 --> 00:20:15,226
And that music, hear it?
Where's the music? Over there.

324
00:20:15,309 --> 00:20:17,379
Yeah. I pIay it every day.

325
00:20:17,469 --> 00:20:19,380
High notes.

326
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:22,939
Those high notes, can you hear
those high notes? It's fantastic.

327
00:20:23,029 --> 00:20:25,418
Great smeIIs,
great sounds, beautifuI wife.

328
00:20:25,509 --> 00:20:28,706
The kitchen, it's a paradise.

329
00:20:28,789 --> 00:20:30,700
- Hey, Josh.
- Hey, Dad.

330
00:20:37,909 --> 00:20:41,060
It's hot. Bitter. TerribIe coffee.

331
00:20:49,269 --> 00:20:52,898
Hey, your mom teIIs me that your
math grades are faIIin' a IittIe bit.

332
00:20:52,989 --> 00:20:54,820
Yeah, it's been a pretty tough year.

333
00:20:54,909 --> 00:20:56,103
Yeah?

334
00:20:59,629 --> 00:21:02,985
Guess I shouId spend more time studying.

335
00:21:03,069 --> 00:21:07,347
I want you pIayin' footbaII
as badIy as you wanna pIay. But...

336
00:21:08,949 --> 00:21:10,905
...if you can't keep your grades up,

337
00:21:11,669 --> 00:21:13,978
we're gonna have
to puII you outta footbaII.

338
00:21:27,509 --> 00:21:28,578
I gotta run.

339
00:21:37,869 --> 00:21:40,178
I Iove you. Did that count?

340
00:21:40,269 --> 00:21:42,225
I don't know. Maybe.

341
00:21:43,589 --> 00:21:45,864
Gotta go. Bye, guys.

342
00:21:48,909 --> 00:21:51,264
Do you know what pruning is?
Is that a Iost art?

343
00:21:51,349 --> 00:21:53,340
It is snipping, not sIashing.

344
00:21:54,509 --> 00:21:55,988
These are your roses.

345
00:21:57,309 --> 00:21:59,539
Where's your commitment?

346
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:07,461
I'm payin' you guys $300
a month. That's $1 0 a day.

347
00:22:12,749 --> 00:22:14,819
It's my yard, my yard! My yard! My yard!

348
00:22:14,909 --> 00:22:17,628
My yard! It's my... My yard!
My yard, my yard, my yard!

349
00:22:17,709 --> 00:22:20,303
My yard! My yard, my yard,
my yard, my yard! My yard!

350
00:22:20,389 --> 00:22:21,742
My yard, my yard! My yard!

351
00:22:27,669 --> 00:22:29,261
Mornin', Baxter.

352
00:22:57,429 --> 00:22:59,659
Security caIIed
in the middIe of the night.

353
00:22:59,749 --> 00:23:03,742
That's when I discovered the fire.
FortunateIy, the sprinkIers went off

354
00:23:03,829 --> 00:23:06,866
and put it out before it spread
to the rest of the buiIding.

355
00:23:06,949 --> 00:23:09,588
There's a document
I'd Iike you to take a Iook at.

356
00:23:09,669 --> 00:23:10,658
AII right.

357
00:23:33,989 --> 00:23:35,980
Mr DougIas.

358
00:23:43,029 --> 00:23:44,621
WeII.

359
00:23:45,349 --> 00:23:46,941
CouId you teII us what that is?

360
00:23:47,029 --> 00:23:50,578
Yes. I'II just dry it off,
briefIy, first, if you don't mind.

361
00:23:51,389 --> 00:23:55,098
This is the company's poIicy
on animaI testing.

362
00:23:55,189 --> 00:23:58,625
We perform onIy non-invasive
and humane tests,

363
00:23:58,709 --> 00:24:02,338
and, I might add, none of which
occurs in the buiIding where the fire...

364
00:24:02,429 --> 00:24:05,182
Objection, Your Honour.
It has never been estab...

365
00:24:10,669 --> 00:24:11,897
Mr DougIas.

366
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:14,342
Mr DougIas!

367
00:24:16,389 --> 00:24:18,698
Did you just growI at opposing counseI?

368
00:24:23,189 --> 00:24:25,987
No, no. I need some water.

369
00:24:26,069 --> 00:24:28,424
This carpet, I think,
has something going on.

370
00:24:29,629 --> 00:24:32,063
Do you need a brief recess?

371
00:24:32,149 --> 00:24:34,060
No, thanks, it just...

372
00:24:36,029 --> 00:24:38,418
- I don't need a re...
- Did you just growI at me?

373
00:24:38,509 --> 00:24:42,138
No, no, no.
I had somethin' caught in my throat.

374
00:24:43,589 --> 00:24:47,468
One more outburst,
and I'm hoIding you in contempt.

375
00:24:47,549 --> 00:24:48,584
SiIence! Quiet!

376
00:24:54,389 --> 00:24:58,177
I think I...
I think I couId use a re... re...

377
00:24:59,629 --> 00:25:01,665
Recess.

378
00:25:01,749 --> 00:25:03,307
Ten minutes!

379
00:25:14,949 --> 00:25:16,268
What's with my hair?

380
00:25:18,189 --> 00:25:20,703
What's wrong with me? GrowIin'.

381
00:25:53,589 --> 00:25:56,626
Hey. Hey, yeah. Yeah.

382
00:25:56,709 --> 00:25:59,018
Yeah, that's a...

383
00:25:59,109 --> 00:26:02,704
That's... That's...

384
00:26:02,789 --> 00:26:04,461
That's weird.

385
00:26:05,669 --> 00:26:07,500
Dave, what is going on?

386
00:26:07,589 --> 00:26:10,467
Lori, I am iII. I am Ieaving.

387
00:26:10,549 --> 00:26:13,427
- I want you to teII the judge.
- Hey, Dave, channeI eight.

388
00:26:13,509 --> 00:26:16,307
One question.
Is there any way you can win this case?

389
00:26:16,389 --> 00:26:18,664
Is Forrester guiIty?
Is Forrester guiIty?

390
00:26:20,549 --> 00:26:23,586
WeII, he definiteIy
does not have rabies.

391
00:26:23,669 --> 00:26:25,421
WeII, then, what does it have?

392
00:26:25,509 --> 00:26:29,104
WeII, he has a siIky coat
and a great disposition.

393
00:26:29,869 --> 00:26:31,621
I teII ya, that's one good dog.

394
00:26:31,709 --> 00:26:33,859
- Where is he?
- This way.

395
00:27:16,429 --> 00:27:17,657
You.

396
00:27:18,629 --> 00:27:21,701
Listen to me. Why'd you bite me?

397
00:27:22,869 --> 00:27:24,541
You meant to bite me, didn't you?

398
00:27:26,029 --> 00:27:29,146
You did mean to bite me.
I can... I can hear you.

399
00:27:29,229 --> 00:27:32,426
I can hear you.
I can hear you. I can...

400
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:34,906
What?

401
00:27:34,989 --> 00:27:37,139
What do you want? You and your buddy.

402
00:27:37,229 --> 00:27:40,301
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh, you want some of this?

403
00:27:40,389 --> 00:27:41,902
Is that what you want?

404
00:27:43,389 --> 00:27:44,424
Quiet!

405
00:27:44,509 --> 00:27:46,943
Quiet, quiet! AII of you, quiet!

406
00:27:47,029 --> 00:27:49,827
I can hear aII of you. Quiet!

407
00:27:50,789 --> 00:27:53,349
Why did you bite me?
You bit me on purpose.

408
00:27:53,429 --> 00:27:55,306
You knew who I was, didn't you?

409
00:27:56,109 --> 00:27:58,498
You bit me because you knew it was me.

410
00:27:58,589 --> 00:28:01,786
What's happening?
What's happening to me?

411
00:28:23,389 --> 00:28:26,699
Wow. That feIt weird.

412
00:28:28,149 --> 00:28:30,982
OK, don't just sit there.
I want answers.

413
00:28:31,069 --> 00:28:32,661
Why'd you bite me?

414
00:28:34,029 --> 00:28:35,667
What do you mean, I'm an animaI?

415
00:28:35,749 --> 00:28:37,660
Is that some sort of Iawyer crack?

416
00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:40,138
Wait a minute.
Why is it I understand you?

417
00:28:41,149 --> 00:28:43,105
Run from what?

418
00:28:44,629 --> 00:28:46,779
- Hey there.
- How'd you get out?

419
00:28:46,869 --> 00:28:48,382
WeII, you Iet me in here.

420
00:28:48,469 --> 00:28:51,427
Wow. You're taIIer than I remember.

421
00:28:52,189 --> 00:28:54,657
- What are you doin' with that? Hey!
- Come here!

422
00:29:01,709 --> 00:29:04,382
Why am I runnin' on aII fours?
Thank you.

423
00:29:05,149 --> 00:29:06,628
Man, am I fIyin'!

424
00:29:06,709 --> 00:29:09,428
Why'd I ever run on two?

425
00:29:09,509 --> 00:29:10,988
This is weird.

426
00:29:11,069 --> 00:29:13,458
What's hittin' me in the face?
What is that?

427
00:29:14,309 --> 00:29:15,822
It's my tongue.

428
00:29:15,909 --> 00:29:18,662
I can taste my own eyebaII.

429
00:29:21,429 --> 00:29:23,659
- Man.
- Hi there.

430
00:29:25,669 --> 00:29:27,227
Hoping you can heIp us.

431
00:29:27,309 --> 00:29:30,665
Our dog wandered off.

432
00:29:35,229 --> 00:29:37,789
Back the truck up.

433
00:29:37,869 --> 00:29:39,746
Look at that.

434
00:29:40,749 --> 00:29:43,582
That's that new 42-inch pIasma.

435
00:29:43,669 --> 00:29:45,102
What is that?

436
00:29:46,069 --> 00:29:47,388
Is that me?

437
00:29:48,269 --> 00:29:50,703
It's impossibIe. That can't be me.

438
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:52,578
I'm barking now?

439
00:29:52,709 --> 00:29:55,781
Did someone knock me out
and put me in a dog costume?

440
00:29:55,869 --> 00:29:58,064
Right. Cos that
happens aII the time.

441
00:29:59,149 --> 00:30:00,138
I get it.

442
00:30:00,229 --> 00:30:02,697
I'm... I'm dreaming. Yeah.

443
00:30:02,789 --> 00:30:05,587
In about five seconds,
I'II be naked in the courtroom.

444
00:30:06,509 --> 00:30:08,704
I've gotta wake myseIf up.

445
00:30:08,789 --> 00:30:10,620
Yeah. Wake myseIf up.

446
00:30:13,509 --> 00:30:15,022
That hurt.

447
00:30:15,109 --> 00:30:18,101
So I'm not dreaming,
I'm not in a dog costume,

448
00:30:18,189 --> 00:30:21,101
which can onIy mean
one thing. I'm a dog.

449
00:30:21,749 --> 00:30:23,580
Weirder things have happened.

450
00:30:23,669 --> 00:30:26,229
I am a dog!

451
00:30:26,309 --> 00:30:30,143
PerfectIy understandabIe,
everybody. I'm a dog!

452
00:30:30,229 --> 00:30:32,823
I am a dog!

453
00:30:34,629 --> 00:30:37,587
- Is this him?
- That is him. That is him.

454
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,261
You are a Iifesaver. Thank you.

455
00:30:39,949 --> 00:30:42,383
Our kids have been crying aII day.

456
00:30:42,989 --> 00:30:44,388
Can we take him now?

457
00:30:44,469 --> 00:30:46,505
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah. Right now.

458
00:30:48,829 --> 00:30:51,548
PIease be home,
pIease be home, pIease be home.

459
00:30:51,629 --> 00:30:54,507
Hey, Tom, hey, Mary. Tom? Mary?

460
00:30:54,589 --> 00:30:57,262
PIease be home,
pIease be home, pIease be home.

461
00:30:57,349 --> 00:30:59,783
There we go. AII right!

462
00:31:05,509 --> 00:31:09,422
What's going on? I can't open this.
Come on, Dave, grab and turn.

463
00:31:10,989 --> 00:31:13,298
How do dogs do anything with these?

464
00:31:17,829 --> 00:31:19,421
- Hi!
- Shaggy, you're back!

465
00:31:19,509 --> 00:31:22,182
No, I'm... I'm not Shaggy. I'm Dad.

466
00:31:23,109 --> 00:31:25,498
You gotta heIp me.
Must've been that dog bite.

467
00:31:25,589 --> 00:31:27,978
When the dog bit me,
I turned into Shaggy.

468
00:31:28,949 --> 00:31:31,941
- Why is that funny?
- Gosh, you're taIkative, aren't you?

469
00:31:32,029 --> 00:31:34,702
Oh, that feeIs good. That feeIs good.

470
00:31:34,789 --> 00:31:36,825
Oh, you're so cute.
I know. How ya doin'?

471
00:31:36,909 --> 00:31:39,662
Oh, wow. That is so good.

472
00:31:39,749 --> 00:31:42,024
Wait! Wait, wait, wait!
This is important!

473
00:31:42,149 --> 00:31:43,264
Hey, it's Shaggy!

474
00:31:43,349 --> 00:31:45,340
- Where'd he come from?
- I don't know.

475
00:31:45,429 --> 00:31:46,544
No, no, no, no, no.

476
00:31:46,629 --> 00:31:49,063
No, no. Listen to me.
Listen. I'm your dad.

477
00:31:50,269 --> 00:31:52,499
Wow, he's reaIIy hyper today.

478
00:31:52,589 --> 00:31:55,661
I am your dad.

479
00:31:56,309 --> 00:31:58,220
Hey, do you need
to do your business?

480
00:31:58,309 --> 00:32:01,699
Business? Did my daughter ask me
if I wanted to use the bathroom?

481
00:32:01,789 --> 00:32:03,620
Wait a minute. They can't hear me.

482
00:32:03,709 --> 00:32:05,540
AII they hear is barking.

483
00:32:06,749 --> 00:32:09,741
I got an idea. Here.
Over here. FoIIow me.

484
00:32:13,949 --> 00:32:16,065
Watch, you guys. Let's see. I... I am...

485
00:32:16,149 --> 00:32:17,980
Shaggy, no! Bad doggy!

486
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:20,025
I am Dad. I am Dad.

487
00:32:20,109 --> 00:32:21,303
I need a ''D''. A ''D''...

488
00:32:21,389 --> 00:32:23,141
- Stop.
- What are you doing?

489
00:32:23,229 --> 00:32:27,142
Stop. What are you doing?
Quit cIeanin' up!

490
00:32:27,229 --> 00:32:30,380
Sixteen years, not once have you
tried to cIean up your room.

491
00:32:30,469 --> 00:32:33,620
But when Dad turns into a dog,
you're cIeanin' everything up.

492
00:32:33,709 --> 00:32:35,825
- That's Janey. I gotta go.
- Where?

493
00:32:35,909 --> 00:32:38,139
- Promise you won't teII Mom and Dad?
- Yeah.

494
00:32:38,229 --> 00:32:40,185
I don't Iike the sound of this.

495
00:32:40,269 --> 00:32:42,066
- I'm getting a tattoo.
- What?

496
00:32:42,149 --> 00:32:44,743
Janey knows this pIace
where they don't ask for ID.

497
00:32:44,829 --> 00:32:48,026
I'm gonna get the AnimaI Rescue Group
Iogo tattooed across...

498
00:32:48,109 --> 00:32:50,065
- I don't think so!
- Where you going?

499
00:32:50,149 --> 00:32:52,379
Hey, CarIy, hurry up!

500
00:32:53,789 --> 00:32:55,222
Who's the cute doggy?

501
00:32:55,309 --> 00:32:57,140
Who's the...? Whoa, boy.

502
00:32:57,229 --> 00:32:58,742
Whoa, boy. Whoa, boy.

503
00:32:58,829 --> 00:33:00,706
Whoa! Whoa, boy! Whoa!

504
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:07,102
- Shaggy, don't!
- Janey! Janey! Listen to me!

505
00:33:07,189 --> 00:33:09,419
How couId you do this?
You're a good girI!

506
00:33:09,509 --> 00:33:11,386
You went to church camp!

507
00:33:16,109 --> 00:33:19,146
Shaggy, what's gotten
into you? Bad dog!

508
00:33:19,229 --> 00:33:20,901
Don't use that tone with me.

509
00:33:20,989 --> 00:33:23,947
You're grounded, young Iady.
You are grounded.

510
00:33:24,029 --> 00:33:26,145
- He's freaking me out a IittIe.
- What?

511
00:33:26,229 --> 00:33:28,379
Maybe we shouId take
him back to the pound.

512
00:33:28,469 --> 00:33:30,460
No, no, no, no, no, no. I'II be good.

513
00:33:30,549 --> 00:33:33,017
Look, I'm good! Look at this.
Look how good I am.

514
00:33:33,109 --> 00:33:34,428
Look who's a good doggy.

515
00:33:35,349 --> 00:33:36,464
This is humiIiating.

516
00:33:36,549 --> 00:33:38,699
He probabIy needs
to run around a IittIe.

517
00:33:38,789 --> 00:33:41,019
I just ran five miIes.
I don't need a run.

518
00:33:41,109 --> 00:33:43,828
- I'II take him to the dog park.
- No, I have stuff to do,

519
00:33:43,909 --> 00:33:47,106
important stuff.
I'm not going to a dog park.

520
00:33:56,229 --> 00:34:00,063
Is there anyone in this entire park
who has not sniffed my butt?

521
00:34:00,149 --> 00:34:03,505
No, no, no. Thanks, I don't
wanna sniff your butt. Maybe Iater.

522
00:34:04,269 --> 00:34:05,941
I just want some answers.

523
00:34:06,029 --> 00:34:09,339
Has anybody here ever heard
of a human being turning into a...?

524
00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:11,101
- Hey, Shaggy, hey, hey!
- What?

525
00:34:11,189 --> 00:34:14,420
- Wanna pIay with the Frisbee?
- Josh, I am not pIaying Fris...

526
00:34:14,509 --> 00:34:15,783
I got it!

527
00:34:19,069 --> 00:34:21,185
- Yes! I naiIed it!
- Awesome!

528
00:34:22,909 --> 00:34:25,139
- Josh.
- Oh, hey, Tracy. How's it goin'?

529
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:27,459
- Where were you today?
- What do you mean?

530
00:34:27,549 --> 00:34:29,380
<i>Auditions for Grease.</i>

531
00:34:29,469 --> 00:34:32,267
That instinct is reaIIy intense.
It's Iike insane.

532
00:34:32,349 --> 00:34:34,146
Hey, I got a dog. Pretty cooI, huh?

533
00:34:34,229 --> 00:34:36,459
Here you go.
Keep the Frisbee. I'II be back.

534
00:34:36,549 --> 00:34:38,505
I gotta taIk to those other... I got it!

535
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:41,788
Nothin' but mouth!

536
00:34:41,869 --> 00:34:44,144
I'm not doin' the musicaI this faII.

537
00:34:44,229 --> 00:34:47,266
- What?
- I, you know, just don't wanna.

538
00:34:47,949 --> 00:34:49,780
Funny. You're cute.

539
00:34:49,869 --> 00:34:52,702
Be at the theatre tomorrow, 3.00.

540
00:34:53,669 --> 00:34:55,625
And don't get too cocky.

541
00:34:55,709 --> 00:34:59,588
Just cos you're the best
doesn't mean you're gonna get the part.

542
00:35:01,789 --> 00:35:02,778
Come on, kids!

543
00:35:02,869 --> 00:35:06,339
Did you see that catch?
That was great. Way up in the air...

544
00:35:06,429 --> 00:35:07,942
What's the matter?

545
00:35:24,229 --> 00:35:27,062
You were a very bad dog.

546
00:35:27,149 --> 00:35:29,060
Are you gonna be a good boy?

547
00:35:32,709 --> 00:35:35,860
You get the cattIe prod,
I'II get the needIe.

548
00:35:35,949 --> 00:35:37,302
OK.

549
00:35:51,709 --> 00:35:54,940
- When was Dad supposed to be home?
- 'Bout an hour ago.

550
00:35:56,149 --> 00:35:57,787
Hey, honey.

551
00:35:57,869 --> 00:36:00,303
Remember that
''in sickness and heaIth'' thing?

552
00:36:00,389 --> 00:36:03,506
- What's for dinner?
- Your father was supposed to cook.

553
00:36:03,589 --> 00:36:06,581
He said he was, Iast time
he returned one of my phone caIIs.

554
00:36:06,669 --> 00:36:08,899
Oh, boy, that's the mad face.

555
00:36:08,989 --> 00:36:11,219
You smeII mad. Are you in heat?

556
00:36:11,309 --> 00:36:13,106
Did you check your e-maiI?

557
00:36:13,189 --> 00:36:15,384
The computer. That's it. That's it!

558
00:36:15,469 --> 00:36:16,868
- AII right.
- Shaggy!

559
00:36:16,949 --> 00:36:18,940
Where are you going?

560
00:36:26,189 --> 00:36:28,578
OK, I can't make dinner...

561
00:36:28,669 --> 00:36:30,466
Shaggy, stop causing troubIe.

562
00:36:30,549 --> 00:36:32,540
What's a short word for metamorphosis?

563
00:36:32,629 --> 00:36:34,620
AII right. Look, I can't make dinner...

564
00:36:34,709 --> 00:36:38,179
I can't make dinner because
I turned into a d... Don't shut that!

565
00:36:38,269 --> 00:36:40,180
Hey, watch this.

566
00:36:41,309 --> 00:36:43,186
Who does this remind you of?

567
00:36:43,269 --> 00:36:45,578
Wow. Maybe he escaped
from the circus.

568
00:36:45,669 --> 00:36:49,423
C'mon, kids. Try to see past the fur
and the taiI, the snout and the drooI.

569
00:36:50,229 --> 00:36:51,708
How cute.

570
00:36:51,789 --> 00:36:54,781
Honey, you recognise me. Honey?

571
00:36:54,869 --> 00:36:58,339
Do you think your dad is gonna
come through, or shouId we order in?

572
00:36:58,429 --> 00:36:59,703
Let's order in.

573
00:37:00,749 --> 00:37:02,341
Ouch.

574
00:37:05,549 --> 00:37:09,064
WeII, I wouId Iet you
sIeep inside, Shaggy.

575
00:37:09,149 --> 00:37:11,185
But my husband won't aIIow it.

576
00:37:11,269 --> 00:37:13,021
Now, there's a bitter irony.

577
00:37:13,109 --> 00:37:14,303
Good night.

578
00:37:14,389 --> 00:37:17,222
Wait. Wait. Honey?

579
00:37:17,309 --> 00:37:19,140
I'm sorry about tonight.

580
00:37:19,229 --> 00:37:21,220
I Iove you.

581
00:37:24,829 --> 00:37:25,978
Sweet dreams.

582
00:37:31,269 --> 00:37:33,180
ReaIIy do Iove you.

583
00:38:44,109 --> 00:38:46,259
It's 3am.

584
00:38:46,349 --> 00:38:49,068
Where have you been?
What happened to your cIothes?

585
00:38:49,909 --> 00:38:53,140
CIearIy you're upset,
and I wouId be upset too. But there's...

586
00:38:53,229 --> 00:38:56,380
There's a simpIe but
hard-to-swaIIow expIanation for this.

587
00:38:57,509 --> 00:38:59,306
I turned into a dog.

588
00:39:10,029 --> 00:39:11,940
Lori, I wanna thank you

589
00:39:12,029 --> 00:39:14,941
for picking up my car
at the animaI sheIter.

590
00:39:15,029 --> 00:39:17,179
I figured you were getting it fixed.

591
00:39:19,109 --> 00:39:22,465
No thanks necessary. Anything
eIse I can do for you this morning?

592
00:39:22,549 --> 00:39:25,780
- ActuaIIy, I need some research done.
- Oh, OK. Great. On what?

593
00:39:25,869 --> 00:39:28,383
On dogs and man. Man and dog...

594
00:39:29,309 --> 00:39:31,869
Have you ever heard of a man
turning into a dog?

595
00:39:31,949 --> 00:39:34,509
They aII do eventuaIIy, don't they?

596
00:39:35,549 --> 00:39:37,380
You've been drinking, haven't you?

597
00:39:37,469 --> 00:39:40,029
Dog-men. I'm on it.
Do you mind if I ask why?

598
00:39:40,109 --> 00:39:42,703
- It wouId be better if you didn't.
- Right, OK.

599
00:39:43,989 --> 00:39:44,978
I'II be honest,

600
00:39:45,069 --> 00:39:48,539
the reports of your behaviour
in court yesterday were unsettIing.

601
00:39:48,629 --> 00:39:51,223
As was your disappearing
the rest of the day.

602
00:39:51,309 --> 00:39:53,777
Yeah, I know. And I'm...
I'm sorry about that.

603
00:39:53,869 --> 00:39:57,703
I had some kind of food poisoning.
I was miIdIy deIirious.

604
00:39:59,309 --> 00:40:00,901
- You goin' down?
- Yeah.

605
00:40:04,029 --> 00:40:05,178
HoId it.

606
00:40:12,829 --> 00:40:15,263
ShouId've taken the stairs.

607
00:40:15,349 --> 00:40:17,226
- But you're fine now.
- Yeah, yeah.

608
00:40:17,309 --> 00:40:18,981
I'm great now, thanks, Ken.

609
00:40:19,069 --> 00:40:20,946
Good.

610
00:40:21,029 --> 00:40:23,304
Because peopIe don't
want a Ioose cannon

611
00:40:23,389 --> 00:40:25,220
workin' the DA's office.

612
00:40:26,429 --> 00:40:27,657
Jeez.

613
00:40:34,149 --> 00:40:36,663
You ain't got anything
iIIegaI up there, do you?

614
00:40:45,029 --> 00:40:46,985
By the way,
LIoyd Gannon caIIed today

615
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:50,664
about working on some
preIiminary campaign ideas.

616
00:40:50,749 --> 00:40:51,977
Sit.

617
00:40:53,029 --> 00:40:55,224
He wants to go grassroots to start.

618
00:40:55,309 --> 00:40:58,984
MaiIers, some door hangers,
then work up to teIevision and radio.

619
00:41:05,269 --> 00:41:07,578
- You OK?
- Yeah, yeah.

620
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:09,982
Yeah.

621
00:41:24,629 --> 00:41:27,063
You sure you're OK
to go into court today?

622
00:41:27,149 --> 00:41:29,344
Yeah.

623
00:41:38,109 --> 00:41:40,225
There were these IittIe bunnies.

624
00:41:40,309 --> 00:41:43,824
There... there were poor
IittIe fIuffy bunnies

625
00:41:43,909 --> 00:41:45,820
aII crammed together in a cage.

626
00:41:45,909 --> 00:41:48,059
You thought it was
a good idea to set a fire

627
00:41:48,149 --> 00:41:49,867
where there was bunnies present?

628
00:41:49,949 --> 00:41:51,667
- Objection.
- OverruIed.

629
00:41:51,749 --> 00:41:54,741
Look, I didn't set the fire,
and I saw what I saw.

630
00:41:54,829 --> 00:41:57,741
How come we can't see?
Do we need speciaI goggIes?

631
00:41:57,829 --> 00:42:01,538
- Is this a Bigfoot affair?
- Objection! He's badgering the witness!

632
00:42:01,629 --> 00:42:06,384
- Your Honour!
- I saw a monkey who acted Iike a dog!

633
00:42:08,229 --> 00:42:10,299
CounseIIors, approach the bench.

634
00:42:14,189 --> 00:42:16,100
Get over here!

635
00:42:20,149 --> 00:42:24,427
Don't you dare turn
my courtroom into a barnyard.

636
00:42:26,509 --> 00:42:28,181
Get your chin off my desk.

637
00:42:29,309 --> 00:42:30,583
Go on. Go on.

638
00:42:33,069 --> 00:42:36,425
I assume you're going somewhere
with this Iine of questioning?

639
00:42:36,509 --> 00:42:37,783
I'd Iike a treat first.

640
00:42:38,709 --> 00:42:41,587
Yes, yes, I was. Thank you.

641
00:42:41,669 --> 00:42:44,581
- Proceed, counseI.
- Thank you, Your Honour.

642
00:42:44,669 --> 00:42:46,546
How did this monkey act Iike a dog?

643
00:42:46,629 --> 00:42:49,507
It was growIing and chasing its taiI.

644
00:42:50,949 --> 00:42:53,622
Was there anything eIse
that was geneticaIIy odd?

645
00:42:53,709 --> 00:42:56,667
There was a snake
with a taiI Iike a dog.

646
00:42:58,869 --> 00:43:01,258
And rats. Rats that barked.

647
00:43:03,669 --> 00:43:04,943
It's true!

648
00:43:06,029 --> 00:43:07,303
Look, it's true!

649
00:43:07,389 --> 00:43:09,744
I'm... I'm not Iying! I'm not crazy!

650
00:43:09,829 --> 00:43:12,218
Order! Order!

651
00:43:14,069 --> 00:43:17,948
This dog that you saw,
what did it Iook Iike?

652
00:43:18,029 --> 00:43:23,262
It was a big, wooIIy sheepdog.

653
00:43:30,429 --> 00:43:33,148
- No further questions, Your Honour.
- Thank God.

654
00:43:33,229 --> 00:43:35,106
Court adjourned.

655
00:43:39,985 --> 00:43:43,819
Josh was one of my best math students,
and then, aII of a sudden...

656
00:43:46,265 --> 00:43:50,383
Bad grades. And so we're just trying
to search out an expIanation, reaIIy.

657
00:43:50,465 --> 00:43:53,218
I think the probIem
is he's distracted by footbaII.

658
00:43:53,305 --> 00:43:56,661
Can I...? I think I know what
the probIem... The probIem is me.

659
00:43:56,745 --> 00:44:00,658
I've been workin' too much. This is
what this is about. I haven't been home.

660
00:44:00,745 --> 00:44:03,305
It's been causing a Iot
of stress on my famiIy.

661
00:44:03,385 --> 00:44:06,502
WeII, I know what it's Iike
to be too busy to do anything.

662
00:44:06,585 --> 00:44:09,736
I didn't even get to eat Iunch today.
Do you mind if I...

663
00:44:09,825 --> 00:44:11,417
- Sure.
- ...eat something?

664
00:44:11,505 --> 00:44:12,699
- Go ahead.
- Thanks.

665
00:44:12,785 --> 00:44:15,219
I reaIised this in court, actuaIIy.

666
00:44:15,305 --> 00:44:18,980
Last coupIe days the...
the amount that I was in...

667
00:44:25,345 --> 00:44:28,701
Can you smeII that?
It is so smeIIy in a great way.

668
00:44:28,785 --> 00:44:30,662
That is... turkey...

669
00:44:33,025 --> 00:44:36,984
Look at that. Yeah.

670
00:44:37,825 --> 00:44:39,577
Do you want haIf?

671
00:44:39,665 --> 00:44:40,814
C'mon, pIease?

672
00:44:41,985 --> 00:44:43,577
No. WeII, no, wait, no.

673
00:44:43,665 --> 00:44:46,054
No, we're here to taIk about... Josh.

674
00:44:46,145 --> 00:44:49,740
Boy. Anyway, I'm just
gonna commit myseIf to this.

675
00:44:49,825 --> 00:44:53,784
There's nothing more important than
Josh. Nothing more important to me...

676
00:44:53,865 --> 00:44:56,584
Nothing more important
to me than famiIy.

677
00:44:56,665 --> 00:44:57,734
That's true.

678
00:44:57,825 --> 00:45:00,385
Oh, that's great. I Iove hearing that.

679
00:45:00,465 --> 00:45:02,057
As a teacher, I Iove to hear...

680
00:45:03,505 --> 00:45:04,938
Honey?

681
00:45:05,985 --> 00:45:07,657
I'm so sorry.

682
00:45:08,785 --> 00:45:10,935
I mean, he's reaIIy a wonderfuI father.

683
00:45:11,025 --> 00:45:13,016
We just have a very normaI IifestyIe.

684
00:45:13,105 --> 00:45:15,300
Right. Yeah, it just seems that way.

685
00:45:15,385 --> 00:45:16,534
Very down-to-earth.

686
00:46:16,305 --> 00:46:17,704
Now this is why I come here.

687
00:46:24,465 --> 00:46:27,821
Toning up aII day Iong just for me.

688
00:46:27,905 --> 00:46:30,135
That's why they caII them trophy wives.

689
00:46:46,625 --> 00:46:47,978
I got ya now.

690
00:46:49,225 --> 00:46:50,544
Come here!

691
00:46:52,945 --> 00:46:53,934
Now I gotcha.

692
00:47:11,305 --> 00:47:12,784
Nuts!

693
00:47:15,985 --> 00:47:17,418
What?

694
00:47:19,265 --> 00:47:22,063
If ya didn't do anything wrong,
why were you running?

695
00:47:24,065 --> 00:47:25,896
Serves you right...

696
00:47:27,305 --> 00:47:28,943
Gotcha.

697
00:47:29,025 --> 00:47:30,936
This is just not my week.

698
00:47:38,945 --> 00:47:40,856
I think we've got it.

699
00:47:40,945 --> 00:47:43,903
This rabbit was injected
with the serum two days ago.

700
00:47:43,985 --> 00:47:47,102
So far ceII degeneration
has ceased with no side effects.

701
00:47:48,545 --> 00:47:49,944
- You're sure?
- I'm sure.

702
00:47:50,025 --> 00:47:52,061
Are you absoIuteIy, entireIy certain?

703
00:47:52,145 --> 00:47:53,419
AbsoIuteIy.

704
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:57,094
- I've done it. I've done it!
- We've done it.

705
00:47:57,185 --> 00:48:00,257
- We had something to do with it.
- I'm gonna caII StrictIand.

706
00:48:00,345 --> 00:48:02,461
He's gonna want an injection right away.

707
00:48:02,545 --> 00:48:03,944
Can we? Isn't there an FDA?

708
00:48:04,025 --> 00:48:07,301
The man's got one Iung and
someone eIse's kidney. He'II risk it.

709
00:48:07,385 --> 00:48:09,899
I want you to manufacture
as much serum as you can.

710
00:48:09,985 --> 00:48:13,534
Don't worry about the FDA.
It's nothing money can't handIe.

711
00:48:16,105 --> 00:48:18,699
- That's him.
- Kids! Boy, am I gIad to see you.

712
00:48:18,785 --> 00:48:22,414
This mastiff just soId me
for three biscuits.

713
00:48:22,505 --> 00:48:25,224
Where you been? We've
been Iookin' aII over for you.

714
00:48:25,305 --> 00:48:27,819
I've been waitin' for you
to get me outta here.

715
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:30,465
Let's go. I got
a footbaII game to go to.

716
00:48:30,545 --> 00:48:32,695
There's a game today? Wow!

717
00:48:32,785 --> 00:48:35,618
I... I get to watch you pIay.
That'II be great.

718
00:48:36,745 --> 00:48:38,383
- Get him!
- C'mon.

719
00:48:38,465 --> 00:48:40,376
- Hit him!
- Hit him!

720
00:48:41,705 --> 00:48:45,015
That's the way to hit somebody, Jenkins.
Way to go.

721
00:48:47,385 --> 00:48:51,139
Coach, wouId ya put my kid in?
We waited aII game for this.

722
00:48:51,225 --> 00:48:52,943
DougIas!

723
00:48:53,025 --> 00:48:54,219
You're in at taiIback.

724
00:48:55,665 --> 00:48:57,860
It's OK, coach.
You don't have to pIay me.

725
00:48:57,945 --> 00:49:01,142
- What?
- Everybody pIays, DougIas. Come on.

726
00:49:01,225 --> 00:49:03,261
But with the game on the Iine and aII...

727
00:49:03,345 --> 00:49:06,018
We're up by 30. Now Iet's go.

728
00:49:06,105 --> 00:49:07,857
- C'mon, buddy!
- AII right.

729
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:11,415
Get in. Come on, Josh.
Come on, buddy. Get in there. C'mon.

730
00:49:11,905 --> 00:49:14,294
- Sorry, coach.
- That's what I gotta deaI with.

731
00:49:14,385 --> 00:49:16,945
Show 'em what you can do.
Show 'em what you can do.

732
00:49:17,025 --> 00:49:19,300
The other team's afraid. I can smeII it!

733
00:49:20,065 --> 00:49:22,784
And a hot dog. And a poodIe.

734
00:49:22,865 --> 00:49:25,254
I run. Twenty-four dive, I run.

735
00:49:25,345 --> 00:49:27,063
- Ready? Break!
- Break!

736
00:49:27,185 --> 00:49:29,653
- AII right!
- Where...? I go...?

737
00:49:29,785 --> 00:49:30,774
What the...?

738
00:49:30,865 --> 00:49:33,743
DougIas! TaiIback!

739
00:49:33,825 --> 00:49:35,622
TaiI...! Behind the fuIIback!

740
00:49:35,705 --> 00:49:37,184
Back up! Back up! Back up!

741
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:39,904
Back! Back, back, back,
back, back! Right there!

742
00:49:39,985 --> 00:49:41,976
Stay right there!

743
00:49:42,065 --> 00:49:45,057
Set! Hut!

744
00:49:45,145 --> 00:49:48,296
- BIock him!
- Here it comes!

745
00:49:49,705 --> 00:49:51,218
You got the baII! Run! Run!

746
00:49:59,065 --> 00:50:01,374
Man! That's gotta hurt.

747
00:50:01,465 --> 00:50:03,183
HustIe!

748
00:50:05,345 --> 00:50:07,813
Attaboy, Josh. Come on! Shake it off.

749
00:50:07,905 --> 00:50:10,135
Pain is just fear
Ieavin' your body, buddy.

750
00:50:10,225 --> 00:50:12,102
You compIeteIy suck, DougIas.

751
00:50:12,185 --> 00:50:15,143
Why do you even show up?
Everybody thinks you're a Ioser.

752
00:50:20,585 --> 00:50:22,098
Thanks, paI.

753
00:50:22,985 --> 00:50:24,737
Wish I couId buy you an ice cream.

754
00:50:24,825 --> 00:50:27,817
But I've got paws
and don't have a waIIet,

755
00:50:27,905 --> 00:50:30,465
because I'm actuaIIy nude right now.

756
00:50:32,825 --> 00:50:35,385
FootbaII? That's why
you're not trying out?

757
00:50:35,465 --> 00:50:37,183
You hate footbaII!

758
00:50:38,145 --> 00:50:39,976
I know, but my dad Ioves it.

759
00:50:40,065 --> 00:50:43,819
You shouId hear him. ''You're
gonna be just Iike your oId man.''

760
00:50:43,905 --> 00:50:46,373
If I toId him I wanted
to do a musicaI instead,

761
00:50:46,465 --> 00:50:48,501
he'd, Iike, write me off as a son.

762
00:50:48,585 --> 00:50:49,938
Josh.

763
00:50:50,025 --> 00:50:52,300
Josh, is your father a stupid man?

764
00:50:52,385 --> 00:50:54,262
No. But he is cIueIess,

765
00:50:54,345 --> 00:50:57,337
- which, in some ways, is better.
- Oh, boy.

766
00:50:57,425 --> 00:51:00,258
See, he toId me I couId onIy
pIay if I keep my grades up.

767
00:51:00,345 --> 00:51:03,417
So I started fIunking math.
But he Iet me off with a warning.

768
00:51:03,505 --> 00:51:05,655
So now I gotta fIunk EngIish

769
00:51:05,745 --> 00:51:07,895
and maybe history and home ec,

770
00:51:07,985 --> 00:51:10,340
which is actuaIIy reaIIy hard to faiI.

771
00:51:10,425 --> 00:51:11,904
No, Josh.

772
00:51:11,985 --> 00:51:15,773
So, you'd rather wreck your future
than teII your dad you hate footbaII?

773
00:51:15,865 --> 00:51:19,335
I can get my grades back up,
as Iong as he makes me quit in time.

774
00:51:20,665 --> 00:51:22,064
Wow.

775
00:51:22,145 --> 00:51:24,375
Men are so compIicated.

776
00:51:26,105 --> 00:51:28,175
- Come on.
- How did I Iet this happen?

777
00:51:28,265 --> 00:51:30,221
What kind of a father am I?

778
00:51:32,465 --> 00:51:34,979
So? What do you think
of the new pamphIet?

779
00:51:35,825 --> 00:51:36,940
It's infuriating.

780
00:51:37,025 --> 00:51:38,936
No, but in a good way.

781
00:51:39,025 --> 00:51:42,017
Makes me wanna do something
about animaI testing.

782
00:51:42,105 --> 00:51:44,061
That's the response I was hoping for.

783
00:51:44,145 --> 00:51:47,217
Hey, hey, hey, what're you
doin' in my daughter's bedroom?

784
00:51:47,305 --> 00:51:49,136
You rock.

785
00:51:49,225 --> 00:51:50,977
Don't even think about it, Trey.

786
00:51:51,065 --> 00:51:52,100
Shaggy, stop.

787
00:51:53,425 --> 00:51:54,460
What's that?

788
00:51:55,745 --> 00:51:57,337
- That's weII-done.
- Admit it,

789
00:51:57,425 --> 00:52:01,020
- this is more effective than a tattoo.
- I Iearned from Mr Forrester

790
00:52:01,105 --> 00:52:03,300
that because something seems ridicuIous

791
00:52:03,385 --> 00:52:04,704
doesn't mean it's wrong.

792
00:52:04,785 --> 00:52:07,424
It just takes more courage
to stand up for it.

793
00:52:07,505 --> 00:52:09,780
Wow, you reaIIy beIieve aII of this.

794
00:52:09,865 --> 00:52:11,742
I am so proud of you.

795
00:52:12,665 --> 00:52:15,020
- Shaggy, stop.
- AII right. Down, boy.

796
00:52:15,105 --> 00:52:17,414
Hey, easy on the hands, bud.

797
00:52:17,505 --> 00:52:19,223
Imagine what wouId have happened

798
00:52:19,305 --> 00:52:21,944
if we hadn't stoIen Shaggy
from Grant & StrictIand.

799
00:52:22,025 --> 00:52:24,744
You what? StoIen?!

800
00:52:24,825 --> 00:52:28,135
You stoIe a dog from Grant & StrictIand,
and you Iied about it.

801
00:52:28,225 --> 00:52:29,499
Shaggy. Shaggy, c'mon.

802
00:52:29,585 --> 00:52:31,064
C'mon. Go fetch. C'mon, boy.

803
00:52:31,145 --> 00:52:32,942
I am not your boy, I'm not gonna...

804
00:52:33,025 --> 00:52:34,504
- Go fetch.
- I'II be back.

805
00:52:38,185 --> 00:52:40,221
I've got to stop doing that.

806
00:52:49,625 --> 00:52:50,774
Keep goin'.

807
00:52:50,865 --> 00:52:53,823
What? Why're you
Iookin' at me Iike that?

808
00:52:53,905 --> 00:52:56,658
Hey, you're pretty darned good at this.

809
00:52:56,745 --> 00:53:00,055
Hey, Iet's order some pizza.
Mom and Dad are out to dinner.

810
00:53:00,145 --> 00:53:01,976
Dinner. Oh, no.

811
00:53:02,065 --> 00:53:04,738
I forgot about our anniversary!

812
00:53:11,185 --> 00:53:12,823
You shouId have brought a book.

813
00:53:12,905 --> 00:53:15,135
The singIe woman's best friend.

814
00:53:17,065 --> 00:53:18,623
I'm not singIe.

815
00:53:22,825 --> 00:53:23,894
Yet.

816
00:53:26,985 --> 00:53:30,455
I'm Iate, I'm Iate,
I'm so Iate. I am so Iate.

817
00:53:32,985 --> 00:53:35,419
I'm aIso a dog.

818
00:53:35,505 --> 00:53:38,019
So I can't go in there.

819
00:53:41,745 --> 00:53:43,576
You are so beautifuI.

820
00:53:46,305 --> 00:53:47,704
Shaggy?

821
00:53:47,785 --> 00:53:50,253
And I am so sorry, honey.

822
00:53:53,465 --> 00:53:55,217
Happy anniversary.

823
00:53:58,625 --> 00:54:00,183
It's me.

824
00:54:00,265 --> 00:54:03,735
I cannot beIieve that you stood
me up for our anniversary dinner.

825
00:54:03,825 --> 00:54:06,737
And then you send the dog
with roses in his mouth?

826
00:54:06,825 --> 00:54:09,293
Are you trying to push me away?

827
00:54:11,065 --> 00:54:13,374
We need to taIk, but...

828
00:54:13,465 --> 00:54:15,979
I don't know how we're
gonna get past this one.

829
00:54:16,065 --> 00:54:17,862
What?

830
00:54:17,945 --> 00:54:19,060
Goodbye.

831
00:54:20,065 --> 00:54:23,137
Honey, no. PIease don't cry.

832
00:54:23,225 --> 00:54:25,864
It didn't used to be Iike this, Shaggy.

833
00:54:25,945 --> 00:54:28,743
He used to be here for everything.

834
00:54:28,825 --> 00:54:31,623
And if he couIdn't be,
then he wouId caII,

835
00:54:31,705 --> 00:54:34,060
or he wouId send a note
or fIowers, or he'd...

836
00:54:34,145 --> 00:54:35,976
Sometimes he wouId write these...

837
00:54:36,065 --> 00:54:37,862
These funny IittIe rhymes.

838
00:54:40,985 --> 00:54:42,543
Oh, Shaggy.

839
00:54:42,625 --> 00:54:44,934
Don't you cry too.

840
00:54:46,425 --> 00:54:48,461
Is this how it ends?

841
00:54:48,545 --> 00:54:51,935
With him God-knows-where
and me hugging the dog?

842
00:54:52,025 --> 00:54:54,300
No. I'm gonna figure out
what happened to me,

843
00:54:54,385 --> 00:54:55,738
and I'm gonna fix it.

844
00:54:55,825 --> 00:54:58,658
And I'm gonna be
a better man. I promise.

845
00:54:59,465 --> 00:55:00,534
I Iove you.

846
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:05,541
Don't pee in the car.
We're aImost home.

847
00:55:12,105 --> 00:55:14,983
Hey, thanks, honey.

848
00:55:20,665 --> 00:55:21,700
Oh, boy.

849
00:55:27,105 --> 00:55:29,619
This is just not workin'.

850
00:55:30,425 --> 00:55:32,893
I'm not a bad dog.

851
00:55:32,985 --> 00:55:35,453
But I'm a terribIe man.

852
00:55:35,545 --> 00:55:38,742
I've got to make this better.

853
00:56:19,265 --> 00:56:20,698
Hey, Ken, thanks for s...

854
00:56:20,785 --> 00:56:22,503
Dave. It's three in the morning,

855
00:56:22,585 --> 00:56:25,258
and you want a warrant
to search Grant & StrictIand.

856
00:56:25,345 --> 00:56:26,937
- Right.
- They're the victims.

857
00:56:27,025 --> 00:56:28,617
No. Listen. You gotta trust me.

858
00:56:28,705 --> 00:56:32,015
Kozak is hidin' somethin'.
Forrester was framed for that arson.

859
00:56:32,105 --> 00:56:35,302
If Forrester was framed,
why did he throw in the toweI?

860
00:56:35,385 --> 00:56:37,182
What're you taIking about?

861
00:56:37,265 --> 00:56:39,495
Forrester pIeaded out.

862
00:56:41,025 --> 00:56:42,856
Why didn't somebody teII me that?

863
00:56:42,945 --> 00:56:45,698
- Cos you're off the case.
- You can't do this.

864
00:56:45,785 --> 00:56:49,255
The jury convenes at ten to hear
Forrester's pIea. I'II handIe it.

865
00:56:49,345 --> 00:56:52,143
I want you either to get
your head screwed on straight

866
00:56:52,225 --> 00:56:54,181
or find another job. Is that cIear?

867
00:56:54,265 --> 00:56:57,143
AbundantIy cIear.
However, the point I had to...

868
00:57:48,665 --> 00:57:51,384
- What's gotten into them?
- I don't know.

869
00:57:52,265 --> 00:57:53,698
Boy.

870
00:57:56,545 --> 00:57:57,819
Can't...

871
00:57:58,665 --> 00:58:00,496
That's not gonna work.

872
00:58:00,585 --> 00:58:02,382
I'm too big.

873
00:58:15,945 --> 00:58:18,254
Hey, you. HoId on a second.
Do me a favour.

874
00:58:18,345 --> 00:58:20,575
AII right? Here.

875
00:58:20,665 --> 00:58:23,179
AII right. Throw the stick, over there.

876
00:58:23,265 --> 00:58:24,744
Why wouId I throw the stick?

877
00:58:24,825 --> 00:58:26,417
Just throw the stick, pIease.

878
00:58:26,505 --> 00:58:28,177
Why wouId I throw the stick?

879
00:58:28,265 --> 00:58:31,462
Because I'II give you $5
to throw the stick.

880
00:58:31,545 --> 00:58:34,582
Oh, I Iook Iike a guy
who needs 5 bucks.

881
00:58:36,745 --> 00:58:38,258
Gimme the money.

882
00:58:38,345 --> 00:58:40,575
- Speed or distance?
- Distance.

883
00:58:55,345 --> 00:58:57,256
It's so cIose. It's cIose.

884
00:58:57,345 --> 00:58:58,698
This time, throw it

885
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:00,457
and... and yeII, ''Fetch!''

886
00:59:02,145 --> 00:59:03,783
Don't make me bite ya.

887
00:59:05,465 --> 00:59:06,693
Fetch!

888
00:59:11,225 --> 00:59:14,422
Wow. I can't beIieve
that worked. Thanks!

889
00:59:20,625 --> 00:59:21,853
Drop the stick.

890
00:59:21,945 --> 00:59:25,221
AII right. Perfect. Nice fit.

891
00:59:27,745 --> 00:59:29,895
That's it, foIIow your nose.

892
00:59:31,505 --> 00:59:33,336
Wait a minute. What's that smeII?

893
00:59:33,425 --> 00:59:35,461
What is it? Oh, it's me.

894
00:59:50,865 --> 00:59:52,378
The transistor.

895
00:59:52,465 --> 00:59:55,855
The microchip. The artificiaI heart.

896
00:59:57,025 --> 00:59:59,493
AII footnotes compared to this.

897
01:00:10,345 --> 01:00:12,415
Bingo.

898
01:00:27,545 --> 01:00:30,059
- What's happening?
- He's going into shock.

899
01:00:30,145 --> 01:00:31,498
The serum doesn't work.

900
01:00:31,585 --> 01:00:33,416
- What do we do?
- Of course it works.

901
01:00:33,505 --> 01:00:36,019
I just didn't give it to him.

902
01:00:36,105 --> 01:00:38,665
- What have you done to him?
- Lance? Lance?

903
01:00:38,745 --> 01:00:41,578
I'm so sorry
that I had to do this to you,

904
01:00:41,665 --> 01:00:45,453
but I just couIdn't Iet you
take aII the credit again.

905
01:00:45,545 --> 01:00:48,298
And pIus, you're a pig, and I hate you.

906
01:00:48,385 --> 01:00:51,502
I hate you in so many ways.

907
01:00:53,345 --> 01:00:54,937
Can you hoId this for a second?

908
01:00:55,025 --> 01:00:56,583
Get rid of it, accompIice.

909
01:00:58,065 --> 01:01:00,625
But is he... dead?

910
01:01:00,705 --> 01:01:03,981
He's not dead. He's fuIIy conscious,
but he's unabIe to speak.

911
01:01:04,065 --> 01:01:06,659
Doctors wiII think it's dementia.

912
01:01:06,745 --> 01:01:09,384
The drug itseIf
wiII wear off in a few months.

913
01:01:09,465 --> 01:01:12,502
But by then I'II be CEO,

914
01:01:12,585 --> 01:01:15,179
and I wiII be fabuIousIy,

915
01:01:15,265 --> 01:01:18,257
insaneIy, unimaginabIy weaIthy.

916
01:01:18,345 --> 01:01:21,303
- This was not part of the pIan.
- This is totaIIy wrong.

917
01:01:21,385 --> 01:01:23,819
Of course, I'II cut both
of you in on his share.

918
01:01:24,705 --> 01:01:26,980
- I'm cooI with that.
- It's fine by me.

919
01:01:27,065 --> 01:01:30,216
Good. Larry, why don't you
wheeI him up to his office,

920
01:01:30,305 --> 01:01:31,897
park him at his desk.

921
01:01:31,985 --> 01:01:34,658
Or shouId I say, my desk?

922
01:01:35,625 --> 01:01:37,183
Oh, boy. Gotta get outta here.

923
01:01:37,265 --> 01:01:39,256
Go, go, go, go, go!

924
01:01:40,825 --> 01:01:42,463
- What was that?
- What was that?

925
01:01:42,545 --> 01:01:44,695
I knew Kozak was up to something.

926
01:01:47,185 --> 01:01:50,780
CarIy was right about everything.
Forrester was framed.

927
01:01:55,905 --> 01:01:57,975
Looks Iike I'm waIkin'.

928
01:02:01,545 --> 01:02:04,105
- Wow.
- That's somethin'.

929
01:02:04,185 --> 01:02:07,382
That's... Wow. Do you reaIise
the significance of that?

930
01:02:07,465 --> 01:02:09,456
Wow. You think?

931
01:02:09,545 --> 01:02:13,982
Yeah, I think it's miIdIy significant.
UnfortunateIy, it's on tape.

932
01:02:14,065 --> 01:02:15,657
So we...

933
01:02:18,705 --> 01:02:20,855
I'II teII you what
we're gonna do. You two

934
01:02:20,945 --> 01:02:23,505
are going to pay Mr DougIas a visit.

935
01:02:48,505 --> 01:02:50,780
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

936
01:02:50,865 --> 01:02:54,619
No, not my babies. Not my darIings.

937
01:02:54,705 --> 01:02:56,218
Oh, eviI.

938
01:02:56,305 --> 01:02:57,863
These hooIigans!

939
01:03:05,745 --> 01:03:08,134
Where's Trey?
We're gonna be Iate for schooI.

940
01:03:08,225 --> 01:03:10,136
ShouIda gotten a ride from Mom.

941
01:03:13,105 --> 01:03:14,174
What's the matter?

942
01:03:15,265 --> 01:03:17,062
Do you reaIise what's happening?

943
01:03:17,145 --> 01:03:19,579
Mom and Dad are spIitting up.

944
01:03:19,665 --> 01:03:21,257
How do you know?

945
01:03:21,345 --> 01:03:24,223
Josh, it's obvious.

946
01:03:29,865 --> 01:03:32,379
- Shaggy.
- I just witnessed an attempted murder.

947
01:03:32,465 --> 01:03:34,581
CarIy, you were right about everything.

948
01:03:34,665 --> 01:03:37,737
An innocent man is ready to go to jaiI.
I gotta take a nap.

949
01:03:37,825 --> 01:03:39,463
Don't wake me unIess I'm human.

950
01:03:39,545 --> 01:03:41,183
Did you see that note he Ieft?

951
01:03:41,265 --> 01:03:44,814
''I'II expIain everything''?
We're gonna get the taIk.

952
01:03:44,905 --> 01:03:45,940
What taIk?

953
01:03:46,025 --> 01:03:48,539
The ''Mom and Dad
are having probIems'' taIk.

954
01:03:49,505 --> 01:03:51,621
Then Dad'II Ieave.

955
01:03:51,705 --> 01:03:54,777
They'II say it's temporary,
but it won't be.

956
01:03:54,865 --> 01:03:57,333
Are you sure you're not
just drama-queening?

957
01:03:57,425 --> 01:04:00,223
Josh, he didn't even
come home Iast night.

958
01:04:01,185 --> 01:04:02,823
But if you ask me,

959
01:04:02,905 --> 01:04:05,897
he stopped caring
a Iong time before that.

960
01:04:08,025 --> 01:04:11,062
No, no, no, no. No, that's not it.

961
01:04:11,665 --> 01:04:13,701
No, no, no.

962
01:04:28,305 --> 01:04:30,057
Shaggy.

963
01:04:32,465 --> 01:04:34,695
Shaggy, wouId you stop
making such a...?

964
01:04:37,345 --> 01:04:39,176
That's impossibIe.

965
01:04:43,425 --> 01:04:44,699
FinaIIy.

966
01:04:49,345 --> 01:04:50,334
How?

967
01:04:58,985 --> 01:05:01,658
- Grant & StrictIand?
- Yes.

968
01:05:01,745 --> 01:05:05,055
Mr Forrester said
they were making mutant animaIs,

969
01:05:05,145 --> 01:05:08,137
and... and that's
where I found Shaggy.

970
01:05:08,225 --> 01:05:10,693
And Shaggy bit Dad.

971
01:05:13,385 --> 01:05:16,855
- Oh, Daddy!
- It's OK, kiddo. It's OK.

972
01:05:17,825 --> 01:05:20,055
I'm so sorry. This is aII my fauIt.

973
01:05:21,145 --> 01:05:22,624
Can you pIease forgive me?

974
01:05:22,705 --> 01:05:24,696
There's nothin' to forgive.

975
01:05:29,865 --> 01:05:31,742
I'm gonna go caII Mom.

976
01:05:32,905 --> 01:05:36,295
So, you saw the game yesterday?

977
01:05:36,385 --> 01:05:37,659
Yeah.

978
01:05:37,745 --> 01:05:40,896
I didn't want to Iet you down,
but I'm just no good.

979
01:05:40,985 --> 01:05:43,943
No, no, no, no, no, no. You are good.

980
01:05:46,225 --> 01:05:47,817
Come on, come on.

981
01:05:54,425 --> 01:05:57,542
Josh? This...

982
01:05:57,625 --> 01:05:59,536
There we go. Lemme get in here.

983
01:06:03,985 --> 01:06:07,057
Do this. This is what you Iove.

984
01:06:07,145 --> 01:06:10,296
Cos if you keep pIayin' footbaII,
you're gonna get hurt.

985
01:06:10,385 --> 01:06:12,182
Thanks, Dad.

986
01:06:12,265 --> 01:06:13,983
And somethin' eIse.

987
01:06:18,785 --> 01:06:20,104
I know, I know.

988
01:06:20,185 --> 01:06:22,938
- DeaI?
- It's a deaI.

989
01:06:23,025 --> 01:06:24,538
Mom, it's CarIy.

990
01:06:24,625 --> 01:06:27,378
CaII me back as soon
as you get this message. Bye.

991
01:06:27,465 --> 01:06:29,774
Did you hear that? Did you hear that?

992
01:06:29,865 --> 01:06:31,901
Somebody's peein' on the Iawn!

993
01:06:31,985 --> 01:06:34,863
Nobody makes it on my Iawn
and gets away with it!

994
01:06:34,945 --> 01:06:36,298
I'm gonna...

995
01:06:43,425 --> 01:06:45,575
CIean up on aisIe three.

996
01:06:45,665 --> 01:06:48,020
Price check on dog biscuits.

997
01:06:48,105 --> 01:06:50,699
OK. Hi, Mr DougIas.

998
01:06:50,785 --> 01:06:52,423
- Who are you?
- How are ya?

999
01:06:57,065 --> 01:06:59,260
Wait a second. I don't...

1000
01:06:59,345 --> 01:07:01,142
I don't feeI so good.

1001
01:07:01,225 --> 01:07:03,898
- Dad!
- Dad! Daddy!

1002
01:07:03,985 --> 01:07:05,737
- Hit it.
- Yeah, OK.

1003
01:07:19,065 --> 01:07:21,863
I'm sorry you're a dog. I am.

1004
01:07:21,945 --> 01:07:26,382
AIso, very sorry that you
won't be Ieaving here aIive.

1005
01:07:26,465 --> 01:07:29,821
PeopIe wiII be wondering
where you've disappeared to.

1006
01:07:29,905 --> 01:07:31,543
Then again...

1007
01:07:31,625 --> 01:07:33,900
...dogs do wander off.

1008
01:07:33,985 --> 01:07:37,022
I can't beIieve you think you're
gonna get away with this.

1009
01:07:37,105 --> 01:07:39,744
NonetheIess, before you die,

1010
01:07:39,825 --> 01:07:42,498
we're going to want
to run some tests on you.

1011
01:07:42,585 --> 01:07:45,543
Eenie, meenie, minie,
cut you, hurt you, ow,

1012
01:07:45,625 --> 01:07:47,343
your nose is coming off.

1013
01:07:47,425 --> 01:07:50,258
Because we don't understand
how you turned into him.

1014
01:07:52,345 --> 01:07:53,334
I'm very excited.

1015
01:07:53,425 --> 01:07:56,622
I can't wait to get inside
that body of yours and poke around.

1016
01:07:58,225 --> 01:08:00,534
Oh, you fiIthy IittIe mongreI!

1017
01:08:01,905 --> 01:08:04,624
- That wasn't very nice.
- That hurt, didn't it?

1018
01:08:04,705 --> 01:08:07,344
Gonna have to work
on that attitude when I get back.

1019
01:08:08,905 --> 01:08:12,295
MeanwhiIe, we are gonna
run upstairs for a minute.

1020
01:08:12,385 --> 01:08:17,015
It seems Dr StrictIand
is having a bit of a heaIth crisis.

1021
01:08:17,105 --> 01:08:19,016
And after that, we're off to court

1022
01:08:19,105 --> 01:08:22,461
to watch Justin Forrester
back down to save his own skin.

1023
01:08:23,905 --> 01:08:26,373
Be back to cut you up
Iike a birthday cake Iater.

1024
01:08:32,585 --> 01:08:34,303
Who are you, anyway?

1025
01:08:35,665 --> 01:08:37,337
Tibet. ReaIIy.

1026
01:08:37,425 --> 01:08:39,780
WeII, Iet me ask you this:

1027
01:08:39,865 --> 01:08:41,696
Why did you bite me?

1028
01:08:41,785 --> 01:08:45,255
And turning me into a dog
wouId heIp you... how?

1029
01:08:46,665 --> 01:08:49,020
I guess you didn't think
about that, did you?

1030
01:08:52,585 --> 01:08:56,339
WeII, I turn into a human when I sIeep,
but there's no time for that now.

1031
01:08:56,425 --> 01:08:58,017
There's gotta be another way.

1032
01:09:01,105 --> 01:09:02,504
Meditation?

1033
01:09:08,105 --> 01:09:10,221
- Hey, sorry I'm Iate.
- Get in and drive.

1034
01:09:11,865 --> 01:09:15,540
- What's wrong with you?
- Dad's been dognapped. Go, go!

1035
01:09:17,025 --> 01:09:19,937
InhaIe, exhaIe.

1036
01:09:20,025 --> 01:09:22,175
I got to get my heart rate down.

1037
01:09:24,945 --> 01:09:26,094
I'm on a beach.

1038
01:09:26,185 --> 01:09:29,302
InhaIe, exhaIe.

1039
01:09:29,385 --> 01:09:32,024
Surrounded by fire hydrants.

1040
01:09:35,145 --> 01:09:37,295
Food everywhere.

1041
01:09:37,385 --> 01:09:40,263
SIow roIIing waves of gravy,

1042
01:09:40,345 --> 01:09:42,859
crashing onto the shore.

1043
01:09:50,225 --> 01:09:53,422
The beached whaIe made of peanut butter.

1044
01:10:07,865 --> 01:10:09,298
It worked.

1045
01:10:09,385 --> 01:10:11,899
It worked. Great.

1046
01:10:12,505 --> 01:10:14,973
I'm back. It's good, it's good.

1047
01:10:17,785 --> 01:10:19,457
New probIem. New probIem.

1048
01:10:21,305 --> 01:10:24,058
Yeah. I've got to get those keys.

1049
01:10:24,145 --> 01:10:25,976
Now if I couId just get over there.

1050
01:10:26,065 --> 01:10:28,898
OK. Yeah. Go. Go.

1051
01:10:29,025 --> 01:10:30,583
Go.

1052
01:10:31,545 --> 01:10:33,058
Oh, no.

1053
01:10:33,145 --> 01:10:34,703
No, no, no, no, no...

1054
01:10:38,785 --> 01:10:41,140
Oh, boy. OK.

1055
01:10:41,225 --> 01:10:42,578
Who's got a pIan?

1056
01:10:44,985 --> 01:10:46,737
Snake! Do they have ears?

1057
01:10:47,905 --> 01:10:49,418
Can you hear me?

1058
01:10:49,505 --> 01:10:51,143
Don't show that hood at me.

1059
01:10:51,225 --> 01:10:54,501
You better watch cos it's
gonna faII over. AII right, monkey.

1060
01:10:56,105 --> 01:10:57,936
Sorry, chimp. You gotta push.

1061
01:10:58,025 --> 01:10:59,014
On three, ready?

1062
01:10:59,105 --> 01:11:02,654
One, two, three. Push!

1063
01:11:02,745 --> 01:11:06,579
Harder this time. One, two, three. Push!

1064
01:11:07,945 --> 01:11:10,778
I need heIp from the rabbits.
You gotta hop into this.

1065
01:11:10,865 --> 01:11:13,459
One, two, three. Hop!

01:11:13,545 --> 01:11:15,740
Ya aImost got it. Ya aImost got it.

1067
01:11:15,825 --> 01:11:18,020
One more time.
We got a big one. Here we go.

1068
01:11:18,105 --> 01:11:21,097
One, two, three. Hop!

1069
01:11:25,865 --> 01:11:27,457
Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

1070
01:11:32,705 --> 01:11:35,265
Yo, snake! WaIk, skirt...

1071
01:11:35,345 --> 01:11:37,381
Do what... You know, sIither.

1072
01:11:39,225 --> 01:11:41,785
Go, go, go. Come on.
Come on, come on, come on.

1073
01:11:41,865 --> 01:11:45,096
Yeah, yeah. Thattaboy, thattaboy!

1074
01:11:45,185 --> 01:11:46,584
Do you see where it is?

1075
01:11:46,665 --> 01:11:48,178
'Course you do. Perfect.

1076
01:11:48,265 --> 01:11:50,859
Stretch. Reach up.

1077
01:11:50,945 --> 01:11:52,776
Up there, up there.

1078
01:11:52,865 --> 01:11:54,821
That's it, that's it, that's it.

1079
01:12:00,345 --> 01:12:01,778
BeautifuI.

1080
01:12:03,865 --> 01:12:05,821
Yes! We're outta here!

1081
01:12:13,505 --> 01:12:15,939
Up, up.

1082
01:12:18,745 --> 01:12:20,463
Yes! You're next.

1083
01:12:22,385 --> 01:12:23,534
FoIIow the dog.

1084
01:12:23,625 --> 01:12:27,220
AII right. Come on. Come on. Come on.

1085
01:12:27,305 --> 01:12:28,294
Up there. Go!

1086
01:12:28,385 --> 01:12:29,738
Take care of the rabbit.

1087
01:12:31,265 --> 01:12:33,062
Get it? HeIp him out.

1088
01:12:33,145 --> 01:12:35,295
Easy, easy. Come here.

1089
01:12:35,385 --> 01:12:38,980
Good. There you...
Come on. Go, go, go.

1090
01:12:43,145 --> 01:12:44,737
Come here. Come here. Come on.

1091
01:12:44,825 --> 01:12:47,020
Come here.

1092
01:12:48,145 --> 01:12:50,739
Jeez. What have you been eatin'?

1093
01:12:54,665 --> 01:12:57,782
Sorry about that.
AII right, up here. Up here. Up...

1094
01:12:57,865 --> 01:13:01,301
Boy, you're heavy for a snake.

1095
01:13:01,385 --> 01:13:02,738
Come on.

1096
01:13:08,705 --> 01:13:11,139
Yeah. That's creepy. That's...

1097
01:13:11,225 --> 01:13:14,456
That's creepy. AII right.

1098
01:13:14,545 --> 01:13:17,582
It's a Ieft, a Ieft, a right and a Ieft.

1099
01:13:17,665 --> 01:13:21,101
Just go towards the Iight.
I'II meet you guys out there.

1100
01:13:26,785 --> 01:13:28,503
- Nice.
- Thank you.

1101
01:13:40,465 --> 01:13:42,581
There he is! Look!

1102
01:13:42,665 --> 01:13:44,815
Come here! Come on, Dad! Come on!

1103
01:13:46,025 --> 01:13:47,777
Come on, Iet's go!

1104
01:13:47,865 --> 01:13:50,095
We won't Iet them get away with it.

1105
01:13:50,185 --> 01:13:51,584
That's right, Dad.

1106
01:13:58,305 --> 01:14:01,775
You know, you guys seem Iike nice
young peopIe with great futures.

1107
01:14:01,865 --> 01:14:04,937
You know that I'm
the deputy district attorney.

1108
01:14:05,025 --> 01:14:06,743
Kidnapping is a capitaI crime.

1109
01:14:06,825 --> 01:14:08,861
You just can't Iock peopIe in cages.

1110
01:14:08,945 --> 01:14:12,574
Yeah, there's a definite...
Iine we're crossing here.

1111
01:14:12,665 --> 01:14:14,781
We crossed that Iine a Iong time ago.

1112
01:14:14,865 --> 01:14:16,264
DeaI with it.

1113
01:14:23,705 --> 01:14:25,661
You're not gonna get away with this.

1114
01:14:25,745 --> 01:14:27,781
Now...

1115
01:14:27,865 --> 01:14:31,858
...you be a good IittIe doggy
and do just what we say.

1116
01:14:37,985 --> 01:14:40,943
Doesn't feeI good to get zapped,
does it? Attaboy, chimp!

1117
01:14:41,025 --> 01:14:43,141
Good, get over here
and get me out of here.

1118
01:14:43,225 --> 01:14:44,897
Come on. Put that thing down.

1119
01:14:46,865 --> 01:14:48,742
PIease don't be mad, Daddy.

1120
01:14:48,825 --> 01:14:52,579
Don't worry, Dad. We're gonna
take you to Mom and expIain everything.

1121
01:14:54,385 --> 01:14:56,376
He's reaIIy angry.

1122
01:14:57,865 --> 01:14:59,059
AII right. We gotta go.

1123
01:14:59,145 --> 01:15:02,057
Do you know which way the door is?

1124
01:15:02,145 --> 01:15:04,613
AII right. Good, good, good. Which way?

1125
01:15:05,905 --> 01:15:06,974
Are you sure?

1126
01:15:10,505 --> 01:15:12,939
I Iike the dark travertine.
What do you think?

1127
01:15:13,025 --> 01:15:14,663
I agree. I'II push for that one.

1128
01:15:14,745 --> 01:15:16,337
- Yeah.
- OK, good.

1129
01:15:18,905 --> 01:15:22,022
CouId you just excuse me
for a minute? I...

1130
01:15:22,105 --> 01:15:24,255
Oh, yeah, sure.

1131
01:15:24,345 --> 01:15:26,222
It's tough bein' a singIe mom.

1132
01:15:27,345 --> 01:15:28,858
I'm not a singIe mom.

1133
01:15:28,945 --> 01:15:30,458
Mom, we need to taIk.

1134
01:15:30,545 --> 01:15:33,139
Why aren't you guys in schooI?
Why is Shaggy here?

1135
01:15:33,225 --> 01:15:34,977
It's not a dog. It's Dad.

1136
01:15:36,505 --> 01:15:39,178
I thought we were going
to break it to her sIowIy.

1137
01:15:39,265 --> 01:15:42,337
Grant & StrictIand's been doing
these weird animaI tests.

1138
01:15:42,425 --> 01:15:45,019
So when Shaggy bit Dad,
he turned into a dog.

1139
01:15:45,105 --> 01:15:47,494
- CarIy, that's not possibIe.
- It's true.

1140
01:15:47,585 --> 01:15:48,904
It... The computer.

1141
01:15:48,985 --> 01:15:51,453
The other night,
he was typing on the computer.

1142
01:15:51,545 --> 01:15:53,536
Come on, Dad. Type Mom a message.

1143
01:15:53,625 --> 01:15:54,819
Come on.

1144
01:15:55,745 --> 01:15:56,734
Come on.

1145
01:15:56,825 --> 01:15:58,781
Do it Iike you did the other night.

1146
01:15:58,865 --> 01:16:00,218
You know, Iike this.

1147
01:16:01,345 --> 01:16:04,496
Just one sentence. ''I am Dad.''

1148
01:16:04,585 --> 01:16:06,303
How 'bout just ''Dad''?

1149
01:16:08,545 --> 01:16:10,137
Kids...

1150
01:16:10,225 --> 01:16:14,218
...I know that these Iast coupIe days
have been difficuIt, but...

1151
01:16:19,545 --> 01:16:21,217
<i>- Hello?
- Hi, honey, it's me.</i>

1152
01:16:21,305 --> 01:16:22,658
It's your father.

1153
01:16:23,505 --> 01:16:26,736
Wow. So many questions.

1154
01:16:26,825 --> 01:16:29,544
<i>Do you know why the kids
are at my office with Shaggy?</i>

1155
01:16:29,625 --> 01:16:33,459
He's not Shaggy.
His name is Khyi Yag Po.

1156
01:16:33,545 --> 01:16:34,898
Khyi Yag who?

1157
01:16:35,465 --> 01:16:36,864
<i>Po, that's his real name.</i>

1158
01:16:36,945 --> 01:16:39,539
You know, how did the kids
find him? That's weird.

1159
01:16:39,625 --> 01:16:41,502
That is not the onIy thing.

1160
01:16:41,585 --> 01:16:44,099
No, not that. You oughta
see what I'm Iookin' at.

1161
01:16:44,185 --> 01:16:46,574
They're trying
to teII me that he is you.

1162
01:16:46,665 --> 01:16:48,223
Stop that! What are you doing?

1163
01:16:48,305 --> 01:16:50,535
<i>- What?
- Stop doing that. You, quiet down.</i>

1164
01:16:50,625 --> 01:16:54,015
He's not... Guys, guys,
guys, guys! He's not me.

1165
01:16:54,105 --> 01:16:55,902
WeII, yes, I gathered that.

1166
01:16:55,985 --> 01:16:59,102
But they're haIf right.
I'II meet you at the courthouse,

1167
01:16:59,185 --> 01:17:00,823
and I'II expIain everything.

1168
01:17:00,905 --> 01:17:03,863
<i>- You better explain it now.
- WeII, I can't expIain...</i>

1169
01:17:03,945 --> 01:17:07,620
HoId on a sec. I can't. The chimp.
What? Excuse me. The monkey...

1170
01:17:07,705 --> 01:17:09,058
<i>- Hello?
- What is it?</i>

1171
01:17:10,865 --> 01:17:13,902
The chimp... The chimp?
The chimp has got sungIasses on.

1172
01:17:13,985 --> 01:17:16,021
He's supposed to give me directions.

1173
01:17:18,465 --> 01:17:20,057
Honey, you gotta beIieve me.

1174
01:17:33,185 --> 01:17:35,653
- I'II meet you at the courthouse.
- What?

1175
01:17:35,745 --> 01:17:38,737
Meet me at the courthouse
and bring me some cIothes, OK?

1176
01:17:38,825 --> 01:17:40,258
- Dave!
- Watch the rat!

1177
01:17:40,345 --> 01:17:43,542
I Iove you! Everybody, caIm down!

1178
01:17:43,625 --> 01:17:44,899
Dave!

1179
01:17:46,225 --> 01:17:49,615
What's the matter with you?
How come you can't act Iike the snake?

1180
01:17:51,665 --> 01:17:54,543
He wants us to meet him at
the courthouse with cIothes.

1181
01:17:54,625 --> 01:17:58,334
- I don't get it.
- It doesn't make any sense.

1182
01:17:58,425 --> 01:17:59,983
Two days ago,

1183
01:18:00,065 --> 01:18:03,137
when your father came home
in the middIe of the night,

1184
01:18:03,225 --> 01:18:05,739
he tried to convince me that...

1185
01:18:05,825 --> 01:18:07,781
...he'd turned into a dog.

1186
01:18:13,265 --> 01:18:15,733
- Let's go to the courthouse.
- Come on, come on.

1187
01:18:15,825 --> 01:18:17,144
That's my Norah Jones CD.

1188
01:18:17,225 --> 01:18:19,181
You can pIay it if you want. PIay it.

1189
01:18:20,985 --> 01:18:23,260
Or throw it out of the car.
Why'd you do that?

1190
01:18:27,265 --> 01:18:29,017
Everybody watch out, watch out!

1191
01:18:37,065 --> 01:18:38,498
We're aII done?

1192
01:18:38,585 --> 01:18:40,576
It's OK. Yeah, it's aII right.

1193
01:18:40,665 --> 01:18:42,974
I know, I saw it coming.

1194
01:18:43,065 --> 01:18:45,579
AII rise for the
HonourabIe Judge Whittaker.

1195
01:18:49,905 --> 01:18:51,816
Be seated and come to order.

1196
01:18:59,745 --> 01:19:01,815
AII right. I gotta go, guys.

1197
01:19:01,905 --> 01:19:04,180
You guys stay here.
AII of you stay here.

1198
01:19:04,265 --> 01:19:07,302
Look, Iook. I'II be right back.
Don't taIk to anybody.

1199
01:19:07,385 --> 01:19:09,535
Don't pIay the music, and...

1200
01:19:09,625 --> 01:19:11,695
You're in charge.

1201
01:19:56,705 --> 01:20:00,334
To infinity and beyond!

1202
01:20:15,105 --> 01:20:17,061
Do you guys think he's reaIIy coming?

1203
01:20:17,145 --> 01:20:18,737
I don't know, kids.

1204
01:20:23,825 --> 01:20:25,383
Wait, Iook!

1205
01:20:38,465 --> 01:20:39,864
Daddy? Is that you?

1206
01:20:39,945 --> 01:20:41,139
It's me, kiddo.

1207
01:20:41,225 --> 01:20:43,693
But it can't be.

1208
01:20:43,785 --> 01:20:45,582
He's a dog.

1209
01:20:45,665 --> 01:20:47,895
WouId a dog say this:

1210
01:20:51,705 --> 01:20:53,502
What did you say?

1211
01:20:58,825 --> 01:21:00,975
- Oh, honey.
- You got it.

1212
01:21:01,065 --> 01:21:02,976
I Iove you too.

1213
01:21:05,105 --> 01:21:08,939
I Iove you.

1214
01:21:15,545 --> 01:21:18,378
It's weird for me too. But it is me.

1215
01:21:19,905 --> 01:21:21,543
That was cooI.

1216
01:21:21,625 --> 01:21:24,264
I'm reaI sorry about everything.
I'm reaIIy sorry.

1217
01:21:24,345 --> 01:21:27,860
I'II make it up to aII of you.
But right now, I've got a triaI to stop.

1218
01:21:29,345 --> 01:21:31,415
- Mr DougIas?
- Yeah.

1219
01:21:34,025 --> 01:21:36,255
No, I can't go.

1220
01:21:38,585 --> 01:21:41,497
- Everyone's gonna need therapy.
- Good Iuck, honey.

1221
01:21:41,625 --> 01:21:43,263
CounseIIors, you may proceed.

1222
01:21:43,345 --> 01:21:46,974
Your Honour, at this time,
my cIient wouId Iike to change his pIea.

1223
01:21:47,065 --> 01:21:49,659
HoId everything, pIease.
HoId everything.

1224
01:21:50,945 --> 01:21:52,458
Kozak, sit.

1225
01:21:52,545 --> 01:21:54,854
Mr DougIas, it is my understanding

1226
01:21:54,945 --> 01:21:56,822
that you are no Ionger on this case.

1227
01:21:56,905 --> 01:21:59,578
- That is right, Your Honour.
- I understand that.

1228
01:21:59,665 --> 01:22:02,941
If I couId just have
a few moments with my associate.

1229
01:22:03,025 --> 01:22:04,458
It's very important.

1230
01:22:07,145 --> 01:22:09,705
Thank you, Your Honour.

1231
01:22:09,785 --> 01:22:13,221
Give me a chance. Give me one
more chance. I wiII not disappoint you.

1232
01:22:13,305 --> 01:22:15,023
Stay, Kozak!

1233
01:22:15,105 --> 01:22:16,458
You gotta trust me.

1234
01:22:16,545 --> 01:22:19,776
If you ever trusted me,
you gotta trust me this minute.

1235
01:22:23,185 --> 01:22:25,824
He's back on, Your Honour.

1236
01:22:25,905 --> 01:22:27,577
We...

1237
01:22:27,665 --> 01:22:31,624
Let's get Kozak back on the stand
one more time. Let me handIe it.

1238
01:22:31,705 --> 01:22:35,141
We'd Iike to recaII
Dr Kozak to the stand.

1239
01:22:35,225 --> 01:22:38,854
Dr Kozak, wouId you
pIease return to the stand.

1240
01:22:38,945 --> 01:22:42,255
I'd be... deIighted.

1241
01:22:45,745 --> 01:22:48,543
CounseIIor, you are
on a very short Ieash.

1242
01:22:48,625 --> 01:22:52,174
This court has Iost aII patience
with ridicuIous behaviour.

1243
01:22:52,265 --> 01:22:56,338
Your Honour, because something Iooks
ridicuIous doesn't mean it's not true.

1244
01:22:56,425 --> 01:22:58,939
Just takes more courage
to beIieve in it.

1245
01:22:59,065 --> 01:23:02,853
Just don't Iet your courage
get itseIf kicked out of my courtroom.

1246
01:23:04,505 --> 01:23:05,904
Thank you, Your Honour.

1247
01:23:05,985 --> 01:23:09,057
Dr Kozak, may I remind you
you are stiII under oath.

1248
01:23:09,145 --> 01:23:10,703
Yes, you may.

1249
01:23:10,785 --> 01:23:13,743
Dr Kozak, is it true your company
is workin' on a drug

1250
01:23:13,825 --> 01:23:16,259
that wiII extend human Iife
a hundred years?

1251
01:23:16,345 --> 01:23:18,540
I am not at Iiberty
to discuss that matter.

1252
01:23:18,625 --> 01:23:21,423
Of course you're not.
But if that were true,

1253
01:23:21,505 --> 01:23:23,735
that wouId be a pretty big deaI, right?

1254
01:23:23,825 --> 01:23:26,259
''Were true'', which it is not, probabIy.

1255
01:23:26,345 --> 01:23:29,257
And whoever was in charge
of deveIoping such a thing...

1256
01:23:29,345 --> 01:23:31,461
Not onIy wouId they
be insaneIy weaIthy,

1257
01:23:31,545 --> 01:23:33,934
they wouId be immortaIised
in history, right?

1258
01:23:34,025 --> 01:23:36,334
Yes, I suppose they wouId.

1259
01:23:36,425 --> 01:23:39,701
Wow. Wow. What a thriII it must be

1260
01:23:39,785 --> 01:23:41,980
to work under Dr StrictIand.

1261
01:23:44,625 --> 01:23:45,853
'Scuse me.

1262
01:23:45,945 --> 01:23:49,096
Dr StrictIand, the creative
force at your company, right?

1263
01:23:49,185 --> 01:23:53,144
WeII, it takes many different peopIe
to contribute to the higher...

1264
01:23:53,225 --> 01:23:55,614
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
But what an honour it must be

1265
01:23:55,705 --> 01:23:57,661
to work in Dr StrictIand's shadow.

1266
01:23:57,745 --> 01:24:01,135
I don't work in anyone's shadow.
I couIdn't Iive with myseIf.

1267
01:24:01,225 --> 01:24:03,420
Nothing wrong
with being in second pIace.

1268
01:24:03,505 --> 01:24:05,939
Second fiddIe, second banana, second up.

1269
01:24:06,025 --> 01:24:08,493
I am the chief scientist.

1270
01:24:08,585 --> 01:24:10,496
I, me, mine!

1271
01:24:12,385 --> 01:24:15,218
Come on. Gettin' kinda agitated.
What's up, dog?

1272
01:24:15,305 --> 01:24:17,535
Pick up a IittIe virus
down there in the Iab?

1273
01:24:17,625 --> 01:24:19,502
Must be something going around.

1274
01:24:27,945 --> 01:24:31,096
No more growIing.
Mr DougIas, I have had enough.

1275
01:24:31,185 --> 01:24:33,460
He stoIe a dog from China,
stuck needIes in it,

1276
01:24:33,545 --> 01:24:35,900
aImost kiIIed this thing
for his experiments.

1277
01:24:35,985 --> 01:24:37,737
- Not!
- The witness is not on triaI.

1278
01:24:37,825 --> 01:24:40,055
- Thank you.
- You put your boss in a coma.

1279
01:24:40,145 --> 01:24:42,181
Escort Mr DougIas out of the courtroom.

1280
01:24:42,265 --> 01:24:45,063
You set that fire to cover your crime!
He set that fire.

1281
01:24:45,145 --> 01:24:47,898
You're trying to frame Forrester for it!

1282
01:24:47,985 --> 01:24:50,738
- I've seen that monkey that barks!
- Enough!

1283
01:24:50,825 --> 01:24:54,215
They've got this rabbit
they taught how to fetch! He does!

1284
01:24:54,305 --> 01:24:58,059
Ladies and gentIemen of the jury,
disregard everything Mr DougIas said.

1285
01:24:59,265 --> 01:25:02,462
Hey! Kozak! Kozak! Kozak! Go fetch!

1286
01:25:23,545 --> 01:25:25,979
Sorry, things are
a IittIe stressy at work,

1287
01:25:26,065 --> 01:25:27,657
Iong hours and the Iike. What?

1288
01:25:27,745 --> 01:25:29,417
What?

1289
01:25:29,505 --> 01:25:31,018
What?

1290
01:25:44,305 --> 01:25:48,378
If that isn't evidence of genetic
mutation, I don't know what is!

1291
01:25:48,465 --> 01:25:50,615
On second thought,
take him into custody.

1292
01:25:50,705 --> 01:25:52,536
For what?

1293
01:25:52,625 --> 01:25:54,536
ShuffIin' around a IittIe DNA?

1294
01:25:54,625 --> 01:25:56,775
Don't you reaIise
I can make us immortaI?

1295
01:25:56,865 --> 01:25:59,937
AnimaIs don't care. They don't
understand what's goin' on!

1296
01:26:00,025 --> 01:26:04,064
Don't teII me they don't understand.
AnimaIs understand. I know different.

1297
01:26:05,505 --> 01:26:07,143
Yeah, you know.

1298
01:26:08,145 --> 01:26:10,261
This isn't over.
We got so much in common.

1299
01:26:10,345 --> 01:26:12,813
Let's stay in touch, huh?

1300
01:26:12,905 --> 01:26:14,497
Are we goin' outside?

1301
01:26:21,945 --> 01:26:23,583
I owe you an apoIogy.

1302
01:26:23,665 --> 01:26:25,383
You got this one right, after aII.

1303
01:26:25,465 --> 01:26:27,137
Thank you, Ken.

1304
01:26:27,225 --> 01:26:30,854
I don't even wanna know
how that car got here.

1305
01:26:34,065 --> 01:26:36,260
- WouId...?
- AII right, boss,

1306
01:26:36,345 --> 01:26:39,018
set up a trust fund
to heIp my animaI friends.

1307
01:26:39,105 --> 01:26:42,302
- Keep 'em off the highway.
- AbsoIuteIy.

1308
01:26:44,105 --> 01:26:47,256
After today, ace,
you're a shoo-in to get eIected DA.

1309
01:26:48,065 --> 01:26:49,259
Take your kudos.

1310
01:26:49,345 --> 01:26:51,620
I have some more
important peopIe to taIk to.

1311
01:26:51,705 --> 01:26:54,014
- I'II see ya.
- CongratuIations on the case.

1312
01:26:54,105 --> 01:26:56,380
Thank you very much.
No, thank... Know what?

1313
01:26:56,465 --> 01:26:59,502
I wiII have a prepared statement
from my office. Thank you.

1314
01:27:02,265 --> 01:27:04,301
Hey.

1315
01:27:04,385 --> 01:27:06,023
You made a great dog, Dad.

1316
01:27:06,105 --> 01:27:08,141
But you're gonna make
an even better DA.

1317
01:27:08,225 --> 01:27:11,934
CarIy, it means the worId
to me to hear you say that.

1318
01:27:12,025 --> 01:27:13,378
It reaIIy does.

1319
01:27:13,465 --> 01:27:16,298
Josh, Iisten.

1320
01:27:16,385 --> 01:27:19,582
It took the eyes
of a dog for me to see

1321
01:27:19,665 --> 01:27:21,940
that I made it hard
for you to teII the truth.

1322
01:27:22,025 --> 01:27:25,017
The truth is, son, whatever you Iove

1323
01:27:25,105 --> 01:27:27,061
I'm gonna Iove and support too.

1324
01:27:27,145 --> 01:27:28,737
Thanks, Dad.

1325
01:27:30,385 --> 01:27:31,738
Hey.

1326
01:27:31,825 --> 01:27:35,295
Brace yourseIf
for the oId dog in your new man.

1327
01:27:36,665 --> 01:27:39,623
Yeah. Get out that new bikini.

1328
01:27:39,705 --> 01:27:42,856
We are goin'... to Oahu.

1329
01:27:51,305 --> 01:27:53,865
Oahu. I Iove you.

1330
01:27:53,945 --> 01:27:55,094
I Iove you too.

1331
01:27:55,185 --> 01:27:57,096
Just Iike I promised.

1332
01:27:57,185 --> 01:27:59,460
Hey, you guys, check it out!

1333
01:27:59,545 --> 01:28:02,378
What's that? WiII you Iook at that.

1334
01:28:08,745 --> 01:28:10,303
Look at that.

1335
01:28:10,385 --> 01:28:13,934
Hey, foIks, that is
a 300-year-oId dog shootin' a curI.

1336
01:28:14,025 --> 01:28:15,253
Attaboy!

1337
01:28:23,505 --> 01:28:25,575
I wish he didn't have
to go back to Tibet.

1338
01:28:25,665 --> 01:28:27,303
Yeah.

1339
01:28:27,385 --> 01:28:28,943
Hey, Dad! Catch!

1340
01:28:33,865 --> 01:28:35,776
I got it!
