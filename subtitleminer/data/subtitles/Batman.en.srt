1
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:12,281
Thank you. Hi. I'd like
to go to the Adelphi Hotel.

2
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,688
This is my cab.

3
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:17,126
I was here first!

4
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:18,853
Oh, God.

5
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:29,364
Let's go across. Come on.

6
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,708
We'll get one down the road.
Hurry.

7
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:40,813
For God's sake, Harold,
can we please get a taxi?

8
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,715
I'm trying to get a--. Taxi!

9
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:45,050
We're going the wrong way!

10
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:49,058
Put that away. We look like tourists.

11
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:52,054
Let's cut over to Seventh.

12
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:55,358
-Seventh is that way.
-I know where we are!

13
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:18,187
Hey, give me a dollar.

14
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,250
How about it? One dollar.

15
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,419
Are you deaf?
You don't speak English?

16
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,595
Come on! Up here.

17
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:31,767
Hey, lady...

18
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:34,372
...do the kid a favor. Don't scream.

19
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,291
Hey, all right!

20
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:58,620
American Express card.

21
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:00,896
"Don't leave home without it."

22
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:03,565
Get out of here.

23
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,797
I don' t like it up here.

24
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,806
Are you scared of heights?

25
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:14,636
I don't know. After what
happened to Johnny Gobs--

26
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:19,148
Look, Johnny Gobs got ripped and
took a walk off a roof. No big loss.

27
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,151
That ain't what I heard at all.

28
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,920
I heard that The Bat got him.

29
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:29,151
The Bat?! Give me a break, will you?

30
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:33,158
Five stories. Straight down.
There wasn't no blood in the body.

31
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:36,832
No shit. It was all over the pavement.

32
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:43,436
-I'm getting out of here.
-Shut up. Listen to me.

33
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:46,008
There ain't no Bat.

34
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,613
You shouldn't have turned
the gun on that kid.

35
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:55,685
You want your cut of this money
or not? Now shut up! Shut up!

36
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:41,159
Don't kill me!

37
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,561
Don't kill me!

38
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:45,160
Don't kill me! Don't kill me!

39
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:48,238
I won't kill you.
I want you to do me a favor.

40
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,069
Tell all your friends about me.

41
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,175
What are you?

42
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:54,176
I'm Batman.

43
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,758
Across this nation...

44
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:21,029
...the words "Gotham City"
are synonymous with crime.

45
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:25,373
Our streets are overrun, our
public officials are helpless.

46
00:07:25,712 --> 00:07:29,546
As mayor, I promise to root out
the source of this corruption...

47
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,773
...Boss Carl Grissom.

48
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:35,451
Now, our new District
Attorney, Harvey Dent...

49
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:38,450
...will carry out that promise.

50
00:07:45,732 --> 00:07:48,064
Thank you, Mayor Borg.
Thank you.

51
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:51,296
People of Gotham City...

52
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,296
...l'm a man of few words.

53
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:58,971
But those words will count,
and so will my actions.

54
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:03,749
Commissioner Gordon informs me that
he has targeted those businesses...

55
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:07,316
...suspected of fronting for
the syndicate in this city.

56
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,649
Before this week is out...

57
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:14,149
...we are going to knock
down their doors...

58
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:18,828
...and shed the light of the
law on that nest of vipers.

59
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:26,271
Together we can make this
city safe for decent people.

60
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:31,432
Decent people shouldn't live here.

61
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:34,335
They'd be happier someplace else.

62
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:37,179
Pretty tough talk about Carl.

63
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,514
Forget about it.

64
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:44,789
If this clown could touch Grissom,
I'd have handed him his lungs by now.

65
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:48,190
If Grissom knew about us...

66
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:51,026
...he might hand you something.

67
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:54,463
Don't flatter yourself, angel.

68
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:59,465
He's a tired old man.
He can't run this city without me.

69
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,035
And besides...

70
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,039
...he doesn't know.

71
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:13,149
You don't worry about
anything, do you, Jack?

72
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:26,154
You look fine.

73
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:30,063
I didn't ask.

74
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,068
Yeah. Hanging on.

75
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:51,081
Let me guess.

76
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:55,818
Giant, menacing, supernatural form.
Kind of like a bat.

77
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,825
That's it. What are
they seeing up there?

78
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,093
They're drinking Drano.

79
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:02,494
It's weird.

80
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:04,258
Thanks for the tip.

81
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,595
Christ. Knox.

82
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:10,938
Lieutenant, I hear we
had another Bat attack.

83
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:16,012
That's 8 sightings in a month. I hear
the Commissioner's opened a file.

84
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:19,945
Sorry, Knox. These two
slipped on a banana peel.

85
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,949
I'm telling you, a giant bat!

86
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:31,961
Don't write about this. It will ruin
your already useless reputation.

87
00:10:32,532 --> 00:10:35,524
Lieutenant, every punk
in this town is scared.

88
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:38,531
They say he can't be killed.

89
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,795
They say he drinks blood.

90
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,203
I say you're full of shit, Knox.

91
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,478
You can quote me on that.

92
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:53,384
Is there a 6-foot bat in Gotham City?

93
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,814
Is he on the police payroll?

94
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:58,819
What's he pulling down, after taxes?

95
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:30,344
Brought you a little snack, Eckhardt.

96
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:35,250
-Why don't you broadcast it?
-Shut up and listen.

97
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:40,425
Harvey Dent has been sniffing
around one of our front companies.

98
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:45,034
That's my territory.
If there's a problem, I deal with it.

99
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,696
Your problems are our problems.

100
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:52,605
I answer to Grissom, not to psychos.

101
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,112
You ought to think about the future.

102
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,947
You mean when you run the show?
You got no future.

103
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,712
You're an A-1 nut-boy,
and Grissom knows it.

104
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,124
Better be sure.

105
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:18,959
See?

106
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:22,733
You can make a good
decision when you try.

107
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,313
Where you been spending your nights?

108
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:42,316
I don't care if this festival
is in debt, I want a parade.

109
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:44,827
I want hot dogs, balloons, everything.

110
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:48,760
We'll celebrate this 200th
anniversary proudly and publicly.

111
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:50,832
We may celebrate
in bankruptcy court.

112
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:54,436
It's $250,000 in debt and we
haven't seen one balloon.

113
00:12:54,674 --> 00:12:58,110
You fill the square with people,
and businesses will come back.

114
00:12:58,344 --> 00:13:01,177
A lot of people may stay away.
They're scared.

115
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:04,348
They won't be scared when you
get Grissom in the courthouse.

116
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:07,017
I promised that, remember?

117
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:12,287
Welcome, Count Dracula.

118
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,783
Had any sightings of Big Foot lately?

119
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:18,457
-They buried your story on Batman.
-They bury garbage.

120
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:21,460
This is Pulitzer Prize stuff.

121
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,798
I got something for you.

122
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,439
Very funny. You should have
put more gore under the fangs.

123
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,804
What a dick.

124
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,142
Hello, legs.

125
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:41,383
I'm reading your stuff.

126
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,315
Well, I'm reading yours.

127
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:45,656
Hi, I'm Vicki Vale.

128
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:48,883
Yeah, photographer.
Vogue, Cosmo. Yeah.

129
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:52,324
If you want me to pose nude,
you'll need a long lens.

130
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:55,162
Actually, I was in the Corto Maltese.

131
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,827
You could get hurt doing this stuff.

132
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:01,665
What brings you here?

133
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:04,840
I'm here to see the
wildlife in Gotham City.

134
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:07,568
Wildlife? Like what?

135
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:10,909
Like...bats.

136
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:15,417
-Who sent you?
-Nobody, really.

137
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,849
I just loved your story, and...

138
00:14:18,758 --> 00:14:20,749
...l like bats.

139
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:26,857
My pictures, your words.
Pulitzer Prize material. Just think.

140
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,691
Okay, you're a visionary, and also
the only one who believes me.

141
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:32,198
I need something tangible.

142
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,864
Gordon's got a file. I can't
even get him on the phone.

143
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,700
He'll be at Bruce
Wayne's benefit, right?

144
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:42,277
Yeah. I don't seem to be
on the guest list. No.

145
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:47,950
Yes, yes. Vale, will you marry me?

146
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:50,278
-No.
-Buy me lunch?

147
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:53,047
-Maybe.
-I eat light.

148
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,393
Say this...

149
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,630
...son-of-a-bitch...

150
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:07,302
...makes a connection with
us and with Axis Chemical.

151
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,905
What kind of damage
are we looking at?

152
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:13,408
If he ties us with Axis Chemical,
we're dead and buried.

153
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:15,978
We should move immediately.

154
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:19,073
I say we break into the place...

155
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,079
...trash the office...

156
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:25,818
...and make off with the records
and say it was industrial espionage.

157
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:31,596
Smart thinking. That's
the way to go. In fact...

158
00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:35,164
...l'd like you to handle
this operation personally.

159
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:38,261
Me?

160
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:49,111
Would you mind waiting
in the next room?

161
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,960
That's all, gentlemen. Thank you.
That's all.

162
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:21,141
Can somebody else do this?

163
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,714
The fumes in that place....

164
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:31,316
It's an important job. I need...

165
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:33,648
...someone I can trust.

166
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:37,489
You...are my number one guy.

167
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,330
Now...

168
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,329
...don't forget...

169
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,500
...your lucky deck.

170
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,513
My friend...

171
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:05,018
...your luck is about to change.

172
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:10,418
Police Department.

173
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:13,095
Get me Lieutenant Eckhardt.

174
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,031
Can I help you, sir?

175
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:15,724
-Good evening.
-A little crowded.

176
00:18:26,739 --> 00:18:28,900
Could you tell me
which is Bruce Wayne?

177
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:31,398
I'm not sure.

178
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:33,775
Thanks anyway.

179
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,671
Eight. I can make that eight.

180
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:13,014
I can make that eight.

181
00:19:13,686 --> 00:19:16,018
Commissioner!
Mrs. Gordon, you look lovely.

182
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:19,689
Is it true the Commissioner
has a file on the Batman?

183
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:23,951
There is no Bat. If there were,
we would find and arrest him.

184
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:26,528
Be straight with me, Commissioner.

185
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,357
How you making out?

186
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:30,693
Mr. Dent, I love that tie.

187
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:34,461
We were discussing winged vigilantes.
What's your stand?

188
00:19:34,707 --> 00:19:37,198
We have enough problems
in this city...

189
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:39,967
...without worrying about ghosts.

190
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:42,703
Pardon me, but that's not a denial.

191
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:46,646
Excuse me, I'll be back.

192
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:48,477
Won't anybody go on record?

193
00:19:48,821 --> 00:19:51,813
-Your Honor, great suit.
-No comment.

194
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:54,723
What's up?

195
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:57,987
Anonymous tip. Napier's
cleaning out Axis Chemicals.

196
00:20:05,738 --> 00:20:08,070
Why wasn't I told? Who's in charge?

197
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,674
-Echkhardt.
-Oh, my God!

198
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:12,342
Come on, let's go.

199
00:20:17,182 --> 00:20:18,672
Mr. Gordon?

200
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:25,917
Mr. Gordon?

201
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:38,366
Wait, wait. Living room,
dining room, arsenal.

202
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:40,768
Look at this stuff.

203
00:20:41,106 --> 00:20:43,097
Who is this guy?

204
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:48,103
He gives to humanitarian causes,
and then collects all this stuff.

205
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:52,043
He probably does it to get chicks.
They like his charity balls.

206
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:55,117
Don't leave out
his very large bankroll.

207
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:58,288
The more they've got,
the less they're worth.

208
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:01,957
This guy must be the most
worthless guy in America.

209
00:21:02,227 --> 00:21:06,891
Check this out. He must have been
the king of the Wicker People.

210
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:10,230
Where'd this come from?

211
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:12,266
I have no idea.

212
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:15,229
It's Japanese.

213
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:16,972
How do you know?

214
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:19,637
I bought it in Japan.

215
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:23,306
-Who are you?
-Sorry. Bruce Wayne.

216
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:26,141
Alexander Knox.

217
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:30,152
I read your work. I like it a lot.

218
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:32,151
Thanks. Can I have a grant?

219
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:34,656
Vicki Vale.

220
00:21:36,995 --> 00:21:38,656
Are you sure?

221
00:21:38,931 --> 00:21:42,833
Yeah. I've seen your pictures
from Corto Maltese, haven't l?

222
00:21:44,837 --> 00:21:46,600
You've got a wonderful eye.

223
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:48,500
Some people think she has two.

224
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:52,941
This is a wonderful house.
I'd like to shoot it sometime.

225
00:21:53,946 --> 00:21:56,847
We need more champagne.
Is that all right?

226
00:21:57,182 --> 00:21:58,843
Sure. Go ahead.

227
00:21:59,952 --> 00:22:02,614
How many cases? Six? Six?

228
00:22:02,855 --> 00:22:04,288
Six is good.

229
00:22:08,126 --> 00:22:09,957
Will you be in Gotham for a while?

230
00:22:10,195 --> 00:22:15,132
I plan to be. I'm intrigued
by Alex's giant bat stories.

231
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:17,631
Oh, right. The bat--. Batman.

232
00:22:20,138 --> 00:22:22,629
A bit light after the
war in Corto Maltese, no?

233
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:24,873
What do you do for a living?

234
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:29,375
Commissioner Gordon
was compelled to leave.

235
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:33,148
Very unexpectedly, sir.

236
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,210
Will you two excuse me?

237
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:39,317
I think perhaps this way, sir.

238
00:22:39,892 --> 00:22:44,727
They need wine in the front room, and
a Mrs. Daley needs a copy of the menu.

239
00:22:47,165 --> 00:22:48,826
And give Knox a grant.

240
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:55,166
Nice talking with you, Wayne.

241
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:57,072
The rich....

242
00:22:57,342 --> 00:23:00,573
Know why they're so odd?
They can afford to be.

243
00:23:01,013 --> 00:23:02,344
Look at this mirror.

244
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:04,572
Maybe it should be Bruce Vain.

245
00:23:43,388 --> 00:23:46,118
-What's up?
-Anonymous tip.

246
00:23:46,391 --> 00:23:48,621
Napier's cleaning out Axis Chemicals.

247
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:52,057
If we could get him,
we'd have Grissom.

248
00:23:53,131 --> 00:23:55,463
Why wasn't I told? Who's in charge?

249
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:58,294
-Eckhardt.
-Oh, my God!

250
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:00,128
Come on, let's go.

251
00:24:15,687 --> 00:24:17,245
Get a good look.

252
00:24:18,256 --> 00:24:20,918
Shoot to kill.
You know what I mean?

253
00:24:22,427 --> 00:24:24,190
Let's move out.

254
00:24:57,396 --> 00:24:59,728
We've been ratted out, boys.

255
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:01,057
Watch it.

256
00:25:07,406 --> 00:25:08,566
Freeze!

257
00:25:26,591 --> 00:25:28,923
You take the right. Move it.

258
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:31,589
What the hell's going on?!

259
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:36,164
-What are you trying to do?
-I'm in charge, not Carl Grissom.

260
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:41,662
This is Commissioner Gordon.
I want him taken alive.

261
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:46,673
I repeat. Any man who opens fire
on Jack Napier will answer to me.

262
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:35,992
Let me down!

263
00:26:36,828 --> 00:26:38,489
Let me down!

264
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:41,991
Let me down!

265
00:26:43,568 --> 00:26:45,058
Oh, my God!

266
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:56,571
Get up on the catwalk on that side.

267
00:27:56,808 --> 00:27:59,299
You take that side. Be very careful.

268
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:15,457
Jesus!

269
00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:20,764
Let him go...or I'll do Gordon.

270
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:34,103
Nice outfit.

271
00:28:47,025 --> 00:28:49,118
Come on, Jack, let's go!

272
00:28:55,967 --> 00:28:57,298
Come on!

273
00:28:59,037 --> 00:29:00,026
Eckhardt!

274
00:29:02,641 --> 00:29:04,040
Think about the future.

275
00:29:47,752 --> 00:29:50,084
Goddamn it, we had him!

276
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:52,913
Hold it right there!

277
00:30:06,871 --> 00:30:09,533
-Who is this guy?
-I don't know.

278
00:30:11,543 --> 00:30:14,205
Until we find him, keep a lid on it.

279
00:30:37,068 --> 00:30:41,402
If there's no Bat, then who
dropped Napier into the acid?

280
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:44,903
Suicide?! I want to get this on tape.

281
00:30:46,745 --> 00:30:49,646
He hung up. What have you got?

282
00:30:49,914 --> 00:30:51,575
Here's the inner city.

283
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,479
Here's the sightings so far.

284
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:57,580
Maybe Batman has some
sort of flight pattern.

285
00:30:57,822 --> 00:31:02,088
This is very good. Tonight we'll go
to dinner, then we'll walk the trail.

286
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:04,921
No can do. I got a date.
Bruce Wayne.

287
00:31:05,497 --> 00:31:07,260
Wayne! Wayne! Oh, no!

288
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:10,261
The guy's a stiff.
You could do much better.

289
00:31:10,602 --> 00:31:12,763
Thanks for being so concerned.

290
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:28,849
How's the soup?

291
00:31:30,855 --> 00:31:32,288
Excuse me?

292
00:31:33,691 --> 00:31:36,023
The soup. How is it?

293
00:31:36,961 --> 00:31:38,792
It's great.

294
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:45,366
Could you pass the salt?

295
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:08,051
Did you have trouble
finding the house?

296
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:12,059
-It was no problem.
-Good.

297
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:18,400
Do you like eating here?

298
00:32:26,911 --> 00:32:29,744
I don't think I've been
in this room before.

299
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,183
You want to leave?

300
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:35,679
Yes.

301
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:46,027
There was young Master Bruce...

302
00:32:46,364 --> 00:32:49,265
...leading his grey pony
with me on its back...

303
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:54,096
...like a sack of old potatoes, covered
in mud and nursing a sprained ankle.

304
00:32:55,206 --> 00:32:59,199
That was the first and last time
I gave him a riding lesson.

305
00:33:00,445 --> 00:33:03,380
I think I've embarrassed
him for long enough.

306
00:33:04,215 --> 00:33:05,876
I'm off to bed.

307
00:33:06,551 --> 00:33:09,782
Please, leave everything.
I'll tidy up in the morning.

308
00:33:19,898 --> 00:33:23,129
He's really wonderful.
He loves you a lot.

309
00:33:23,401 --> 00:33:27,235
Alfred's great. I couldn't
find my socks without him.

310
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:30,805
He reminds me of my grandfather.

311
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:33,475
Were you close to him?

312
00:33:33,978 --> 00:33:36,742
I used to spend summers with
him and my grandmother.

313
00:33:36,981 --> 00:33:41,645
They had a house on the lake.
Nothing like this, but...

314
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,819
...it was fun.

315
00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:46,147
That sounds nice.

316
00:33:48,927 --> 00:33:50,588
What about your family?

317
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:55,264
Actually, Alfred is my family.

318
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:03,266
This house and all this stuff
doesn't seem like you at all.

319
00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:08,505
Some of it is very much me.

320
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:11,512
Some isn't.

321
00:34:13,117 --> 00:34:15,950
That dining room
is definitely not you.

322
00:34:16,287 --> 00:34:17,618
The dining room isn't.

323
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:43,010
Let's see how we did.

324
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:05,262
Oh, my God!

325
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:06,759
Mirror.

326
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,098
Mirror!

327
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:23,714
You understand that the nerves
were completely severed.

328
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,895
You see what I have
to work with here.

329
00:35:53,918 --> 00:35:56,751
There's an awful lot of
stairs in this place.

330
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:58,819
My feet are killing me.

331
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:10,490
I feel a little drunk.
And you're not anything.

332
00:36:10,768 --> 00:36:12,429
One drink and I'm flying.

333
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:15,665
Why are you afraid of flying?

334
00:36:46,304 --> 00:36:48,135
That you, sugar bumps?

335
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:51,368
Who are you?

336
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:53,800
It's me.

337
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:55,973
"Sugar bumps."

338
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:03,719
You're alive! I heard you'd been--

339
00:37:03,988 --> 00:37:05,046
Fried?

340
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:07,384
Is that what you heard?

341
00:37:07,825 --> 00:37:09,986
You set me up over a woman.

342
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:12,719
A woman!

343
00:37:13,498 --> 00:37:15,489
You must be insane.

344
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,013
Don't bother.

345
00:37:32,517 --> 00:37:35,077
Your life won't be worth spit!

346
00:37:36,521 --> 00:37:38,853
I've been dead once already.

347
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:41,088
It's very liberating...

348
00:37:41,526 --> 00:37:44,518
...if you think of it as...therapy.

349
00:37:46,531 --> 00:37:48,362
Jack, listen.

350
00:37:51,035 --> 00:37:53,026
Maybe we can cut a deal.

351
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,432
Jack?

352
00:37:56,374 --> 00:37:58,706
Jack is dead, my friend.

353
00:37:59,544 --> 00:38:01,205
You can call me...

354
00:38:01,546 --> 00:38:02,535
...Joker.

355
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:05,609
As you can see...

356
00:38:05,883 --> 00:38:07,544
...l'm a lot happier.

357
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:34,401
Oh, what a day.

358
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,461
Gotham City.

359
00:39:34,305 --> 00:39:37,706
It always brings a smile to my face.

360
00:39:41,646 --> 00:39:43,637
"Winged Freak...

361
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:48,378
...Terrorizes--"

362
00:39:51,989 --> 00:39:54,321
Wait'll they get a load of me.

363
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:14,177
I've got an idea. How about lunch at
my place? I'll show you some photos.

364
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:15,902
Sure. Okay.

365
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:19,513
Wait a minute. No, I can't.
I can't make it.

366
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:22,679
Okay, we'll do it later in the day.

367
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:27,357
I can't make it then, either. I've
got a very important meeting today.

368
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:30,082
What's wrong?

369
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:32,187
Nothing.

370
00:40:33,364 --> 00:40:35,764
I have to leave town for a few days.

371
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:38,360
Okay, we'll do it when you get back.

372
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,363
I have to go. I'm late.

373
00:40:57,722 --> 00:41:01,055
-Nice to see you again.
-Nice to see you, too.

374
00:41:02,226 --> 00:41:05,127
I'll talk to you guys
when you get back.

375
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:08,297
Back, Miss Vale? We'll be
here for quite a while.

376
00:41:22,246 --> 00:41:25,409
You'll never believe what
happened to me today.

377
00:41:39,463 --> 00:41:44,127
So, gentlemen, that's how it is.
Until Grissom...resurfaces...

378
00:41:44,568 --> 00:41:46,229
...l'm the acting president.

379
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:49,962
And I say, starting with
this anniversary festival...

380
00:41:50,241 --> 00:41:52,300
...we run this city
into the ground.

381
00:41:52,576 --> 00:41:54,567
Why don't we hear this from Grissom?

382
00:41:54,812 --> 00:41:55,972
Yeah.

383
00:41:56,747 --> 00:41:59,079
And what's with that stupid grin?

384
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:02,744
Life's been good to me.

385
00:42:06,757 --> 00:42:08,486
What if we say "no"?

386
00:42:13,664 --> 00:42:15,825
Nobody wants a war.

387
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:21,003
If we can't do business, we'll just
shake hands and that'll be it.

388
00:42:21,505 --> 00:42:22,233
Yeah?

389
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:34,681
I got a live one here.

390
00:42:41,859 --> 00:42:46,353
There'll be a hot time
in the old town tonight.

391
00:43:03,714 --> 00:43:06,808
Antoine got a little
hot under the collar.

392
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:09,616
You're crazy.

393
00:43:12,223 --> 00:43:15,715
Haven't you ever heard of the
healing power of laughter?

394
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:26,068
-Now get out of here!
-Let's go! Move it!

395
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:28,331
You think it over.

396
00:43:47,024 --> 00:43:51,085
Go to the Globe, follow that
reporter Knox. Take your camera.

397
00:43:51,362 --> 00:43:54,263
See what he knows
about this Batman.

398
00:43:55,533 --> 00:43:56,932
And, Bob...

399
00:44:00,604 --> 00:44:02,936
Remember...you...

400
00:44:05,276 --> 00:44:06,766
...are my number one...

401
00:44:07,211 --> 00:44:08,701
...guy.

402
00:44:10,114 --> 00:44:11,604
Yes, sir.

403
00:44:26,564 --> 00:44:28,225
Your pals...

404
00:44:29,066 --> 00:44:30,727
...they're not bad people.

405
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:33,630
Maybe we...

406
00:44:34,638 --> 00:44:37,801
...ought to give them a
few days to think it over.

407
00:44:38,576 --> 00:44:39,736
No?

408
00:44:45,482 --> 00:44:47,143
Grease them now?

409
00:44:50,087 --> 00:44:51,418
Okay.

410
00:44:53,591 --> 00:44:56,424
You are a vicious bastard, Rotelli.

411
00:44:58,329 --> 00:45:00,160
I'm glad you're dead.

412
00:45:07,605 --> 00:45:09,436
I'm glad you're dead.

413
00:45:12,343 --> 00:45:15,107
I'm glad you're dead.

414
00:45:22,019 --> 00:45:23,611
I need that.

415
00:45:24,521 --> 00:45:26,182
I'm losing confidence in you.

416
00:45:26,357 --> 00:45:27,915
I thought we were a team.

417
00:45:28,359 --> 00:45:30,850
Is this a personal issue for you?

418
00:45:31,629 --> 00:45:33,028
I just want you to do your job.

419
00:45:33,364 --> 00:45:34,695
I am doing my job.

420
00:45:34,965 --> 00:45:36,523
And I'm protecting my partner.

421
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:40,634
There's nothing in these files.
Who is this guy?

422
00:45:40,871 --> 00:45:42,463
Who cares?

423
00:45:44,541 --> 00:45:47,374
Forget Bruce Wayne.
I'm onto Batman.

424
00:47:39,089 --> 00:47:42,581
They'll be out any second.
I can't wait to hear the explanation.

425
00:47:51,168 --> 00:47:52,931
What is this affidavit you filed?

426
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:55,001
Grissom gave you his business?

427
00:47:55,439 --> 00:47:58,340
Mr. Grissom asked me,
as a personal favor...

428
00:47:58,675 --> 00:48:01,838
...to take over all his
businesses until he returns.

429
00:48:02,513 --> 00:48:06,506
That's a big favor. You two
must have been very close.

430
00:48:06,784 --> 00:48:09,116
Did you do time together as children?

431
00:48:52,229 --> 00:48:54,993
Our accountants are looking into it.
The affidavit is legitimate.

432
00:49:02,072 --> 00:49:04,563
I smell fresh ink. You can prove this?

433
00:49:04,842 --> 00:49:06,503
Of course you can.

434
00:49:06,743 --> 00:49:09,735
We have witnesses. Grissom's
signature is legitimate.

435
00:49:10,013 --> 00:49:11,412
It is legitimate.

436
00:49:12,516 --> 00:49:14,677
I saw it. I was there.

437
00:49:15,252 --> 00:49:16,844
I saw it all.

438
00:49:17,087 --> 00:49:19,681
He reached up with his dead hand...

439
00:49:20,023 --> 00:49:22,423
...and signed it in his own blood.

440
00:49:22,759 --> 00:49:25,751
And he did it...with this pen.

441
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:29,692
Hello, Vinnie. It's your uncle Bingo.

442
00:49:31,168 --> 00:49:32,795
Time to pay the check.

443
00:49:39,109 --> 00:49:40,440
The pen...

444
00:49:40,944 --> 00:49:43,208
...is truly mightier than the sword.

445
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:00,719
Get down!

446
00:50:20,317 --> 00:50:24,481
Won't this gang war dampen
the city's 200th anniversary?

447
00:50:24,755 --> 00:50:28,589
The festival opens. The police
will stop these gangsters.

448
00:50:29,826 --> 00:50:33,819
What about the theory that
the Batman is a mob enforcer?

449
00:50:34,097 --> 00:50:35,758
I don't have any comment.

450
00:50:41,505 --> 00:50:42,836
Batman.

451
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:45,330
Batman.

452
00:50:46,343 --> 00:50:50,279
Can somebody tell me what
kind of a world we live in...

453
00:50:50,514 --> 00:50:53,506
...when a man dressed as a bat...

454
00:50:53,784 --> 00:50:55,843
...gets all my press?

455
00:50:58,288 --> 00:51:00,279
This town needs an enema!

456
00:51:07,864 --> 00:51:09,855
May I have a glass of...water?

457
00:51:11,702 --> 00:51:13,693
I'm relieved that you're home.

458
00:51:13,971 --> 00:51:17,964
Miss Vale telephoned.
She was rather concerned.

459
00:51:18,308 --> 00:51:21,800
I feel there's a certain weight
that lifts when she is here.

460
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:24,038
Alfred...

461
00:51:24,815 --> 00:51:26,476
...why don't you marry her?

462
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:30,313
That's not exactly what
I had in mind, sir.

463
00:51:36,727 --> 00:51:38,661
I can't go over that right now.

464
00:51:39,329 --> 00:51:40,990
If not now...

465
00:51:43,734 --> 00:51:44,723
...when?

466
00:51:48,572 --> 00:51:49,732
I don't know.

467
00:51:54,077 --> 00:51:56,238
Jack Napier's still alive.

468
00:51:59,249 --> 00:52:03,345
He's running Grissom's men.
I need any information on him.

469
00:52:15,766 --> 00:52:17,427
She is great, isn't she?

470
00:52:18,201 --> 00:52:19,259
Yes.

471
00:52:30,881 --> 00:52:31,870
Knox.

472
00:52:32,883 --> 00:52:34,544
Check something out for me.

473
00:52:35,552 --> 00:52:38,544
Find out what's special about
the alley at Pearl and Phillips.

474
00:52:38,789 --> 00:52:40,450
Pearl and Phillips?

475
00:52:40,891 --> 00:52:41,949
You got it.

476
00:52:52,069 --> 00:52:53,400
Mister Wayne.

477
00:53:17,661 --> 00:53:19,925
So much to do and so little time.

478
00:53:20,163 --> 00:53:21,755
The photos.

479
00:53:24,101 --> 00:53:25,830
Who's that loss?

480
00:53:26,103 --> 00:53:27,092
Knox.

481
00:53:27,337 --> 00:53:29,669
Bad tie. No style.

482
00:53:32,776 --> 00:53:34,437
Stop the press!

483
00:53:34,678 --> 00:53:36,669
-Who is that?
-Vicki Vale.

484
00:53:36,947 --> 00:53:38,938
The photographer
working with Knox.

485
00:53:39,182 --> 00:53:41,446
That girl has style.

486
00:53:41,785 --> 00:53:43,446
Jesus marimba!

487
00:53:43,787 --> 00:53:46,449
A lovely beast like
that running around...

488
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:49,181
...could put steam in a man's strides.

489
00:53:49,459 --> 00:53:51,689
She's dating some guy named Wayne.

490
00:53:51,962 --> 00:53:53,793
She's about to trade up.

491
00:53:54,965 --> 00:53:57,525
It's hard to stay inside the lines.

492
00:54:01,805 --> 00:54:03,204
I'm about...

493
00:54:04,875 --> 00:54:06,866
...to get a new girl.

494
00:54:08,478 --> 00:54:11,140
I'm of a mind to make some mooky.

495
00:54:12,115 --> 00:54:13,013
Phone book.

496
00:54:17,654 --> 00:54:19,815
So much to do...

497
00:54:20,724 --> 00:54:22,487
...and so little time.

498
00:54:48,018 --> 00:54:50,077
Have you shipped a million of those?

499
00:54:51,421 --> 00:54:55,915
Ship them all! We're going to
take them out a whole new door!

500
00:54:59,362 --> 00:55:00,989
Ten seconds to transmission.

501
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,761
Five, four...

502
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:11,532
Cue music.

503
00:55:14,211 --> 00:55:15,701
Cue Becky.

504
00:55:18,949 --> 00:55:22,282
Good evening. The fashion
world was stunned today...

505
00:55:22,552 --> 00:55:26,283
...by the sudden deaths of models
Candy Walker and Amanda Keeler.

506
00:55:26,723 --> 00:55:30,716
Cause of death has been attributed
to a violent allergic reaction...

507
00:55:30,961 --> 00:55:35,625
...although authorities have not
ruled out the possibility of drug use.

508
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:39,633
Plans continue for the
city's 200th birthday...

509
00:55:39,903 --> 00:55:42,804
...as Mayor Borg announced
today at the unveiling--

510
00:55:43,406 --> 00:55:44,964
This just in.

511
00:55:45,976 --> 00:55:48,809
Three mysterious deaths
at a beauty parlor--

512
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:55,445
--were discovered today.

513
00:55:57,754 --> 00:55:59,153
What's going on?

514
00:56:00,423 --> 00:56:02,084
This is hardly the--

515
00:56:05,929 --> 00:56:06,827
Kill the camera.

516
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:11,596
This is Rene on the news floor.
I need paramedics up here now!

517
00:56:17,107 --> 00:56:19,940
New and improved Joker products!

518
00:56:20,176 --> 00:56:22,110
With a new secret ingredient.

519
00:56:22,846 --> 00:56:24,177
Smylex!

520
00:56:24,347 --> 00:56:25,678
What's that?

521
00:56:25,949 --> 00:56:28,281
Let's go over...

522
00:56:29,019 --> 00:56:31,351
...to our blind taste test.

523
00:56:31,521 --> 00:56:33,182
Love that Joker.

524
00:56:33,456 --> 00:56:35,788
-Where's it coming from?
-I don't know.

525
00:56:37,694 --> 00:56:42,188
He don't look happy.
He's been using brand X.

526
00:56:44,134 --> 00:56:46,694
But with new Joker Brand...

527
00:56:47,037 --> 00:56:49,130
...l get a grin again...

528
00:56:49,472 --> 00:56:50,962
...and again.

529
00:56:52,475 --> 00:56:54,306
That luscious tan...

530
00:56:54,811 --> 00:56:56,472
...those ruby lips...

531
00:56:56,713 --> 00:57:01,309
...and hair color so natural, only
your undertaker knows for sure.

532
00:57:02,886 --> 00:57:04,319
You're saying:

533
00:57:04,554 --> 00:57:07,819
"Where can I get these fine,
new items?"

534
00:57:08,058 --> 00:57:12,495
That's the gag. Chances are,
you bought them already!

535
00:57:13,496 --> 00:57:15,225
Love that Joker.

536
00:57:15,565 --> 00:57:16,896
Remember...

537
00:57:17,167 --> 00:57:20,159
...put on a happy face.

538
00:57:24,741 --> 00:57:26,732
The information you requested.

539
00:57:35,185 --> 00:57:38,348
"Jack Napier assault with
a deadly weapon, age 15.

540
00:57:38,588 --> 00:57:41,182
Results of psychological profile...

541
00:57:41,758 --> 00:57:45,524
...violent mood swings, highly
intelligent, emotionally unstable.

542
00:57:46,363 --> 00:57:49,594
Aptitudes include science,
chemistry, and art."

543
00:57:51,868 --> 00:57:53,199
Chemistry.

544
00:57:59,776 --> 00:58:01,107
Let's go shopping.

545
00:58:10,887 --> 00:58:15,722
...six new deaths, with no clues
as to the Joker's deadly weapon.

546
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,951
And what is the pattern?

547
00:58:19,396 --> 00:58:23,298
Foods, alcohol, or beauty
and hygiene products?

548
00:58:23,633 --> 00:58:27,296
Cologne, mouthwash,
underarm deodorant?

549
00:58:27,637 --> 00:58:30,470
Or worse yet,
there may be no pattern.

550
00:58:31,141 --> 00:58:34,804
The search goes on through
Gotham's shopping nightmare.

551
00:58:35,478 --> 00:58:40,313
We are having a festival if I have to
use a gun to get people there myself.

552
00:58:40,583 --> 00:58:44,485
Do you hear the words coming from
my mouth? The festival is on!

553
00:58:44,754 --> 00:58:47,746
Find out what this madman
is poisoning us with.

554
00:58:47,991 --> 00:58:49,424
Do you read me?

555
00:58:50,994 --> 00:58:54,157
We're working on it.
I need all the help I can get.

556
00:58:58,334 --> 00:59:00,495
Hi, it's Vicki.

557
00:59:00,770 --> 00:59:03,330
I'll be ten minutes late to the museum.

558
00:59:03,606 --> 00:59:05,335
I'll see you when you get there.

559
00:59:11,848 --> 00:59:14,180
A message from Miss Vale.

560
00:59:14,517 --> 00:59:17,179
She'll be late meeting
you at the museum.

561
00:59:17,787 --> 00:59:20,449
Okay, thank you.
Wait a minute, Alfred.

562
00:59:21,024 --> 00:59:22,685
I'm not meeting her today.

563
00:59:34,137 --> 00:59:36,537
Jack, where are you going?

564
00:59:38,975 --> 00:59:41,637
Daddy's going to make
some art, darling.

565
01:00:16,346 --> 01:00:18,337
Mr. Wayne's table?

566
01:00:18,681 --> 01:00:21,172
He hasn't arrived yet.

567
01:00:21,584 --> 01:00:23,245
We have a table waiting.

568
01:00:48,778 --> 01:00:51,269
Miss Vale, this just arrived for you.

569
01:01:54,444 --> 01:01:55,672
Gentlemen!

570
01:01:56,179 --> 01:01:59,012
Let's broaden our minds. Lawrence.

571
01:02:20,136 --> 01:02:21,797
Give him a shave.

572
01:02:23,473 --> 01:02:25,304
Terence, brush.

573
01:03:19,195 --> 01:03:20,856
The one-dollar bill.

574
01:03:25,101 --> 01:03:26,090
Hold it!

575
01:03:26,869 --> 01:03:30,032
I kind of like this one. Leave it.

576
01:03:44,454 --> 01:03:46,388
You can take that off now.

577
01:03:49,459 --> 01:03:53,054
You're beautiful...
in an old-fashioned kind of way.

578
01:03:53,296 --> 01:03:56,891
But I'm sure we can make you more...
today.

579
01:04:00,470 --> 01:04:01,903
Your portfolio?

580
01:04:03,473 --> 01:04:06,408
I'm meeting someone who
wants to see my work.

581
01:04:09,078 --> 01:04:10,067
Crap.

582
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:12,311
Crap. Crap.

583
01:04:13,483 --> 01:04:15,246
Crap. Crap.

584
01:04:18,755 --> 01:04:20,586
Now that's good work.

585
01:04:23,993 --> 01:04:25,654
The skulls, the bodies.

586
01:04:26,095 --> 01:04:30,498
You give it such a glow. I don't
know if it's art, but I like it.

587
01:04:32,668 --> 01:04:35,330
Let me tell you
what I'm thinking about.

588
01:04:35,605 --> 01:04:37,436
I was in the bath one day...

589
01:04:37,673 --> 01:04:41,439
...when I realized why I
was destined for greatness.

590
01:04:42,111 --> 01:04:45,171
You know how concerned people
are about appearances.

591
01:04:45,615 --> 01:04:48,106
This is attractive, that is not.

592
01:04:48,451 --> 01:04:52,683
That is all behind me. I now do
what other people only dream.

593
01:04:53,289 --> 01:04:55,951
I make art...until someone dies.

594
01:04:56,359 --> 01:04:57,451
See?

595
01:04:59,028 --> 01:05:03,294
I am the world's first
fully-functioning homicidal artist.

596
01:05:05,701 --> 01:05:06,861
What do you want?

597
01:05:08,805 --> 01:05:10,705
My face on the one-dollar bill.

598
01:05:13,142 --> 01:05:14,541
You're joking.

599
01:05:15,711 --> 01:05:17,474
Do I look like I'm joking?

600
01:05:18,314 --> 01:05:19,303
No.

601
01:05:19,715 --> 01:05:20,875
Listen.

602
01:05:21,384 --> 01:05:25,878
We mustn't compare ourselves with
regular people. We're artists.

603
01:05:26,222 --> 01:05:29,555
For instance, let me challenge
you with a piece I did.

604
01:05:29,826 --> 01:05:31,987
Bob. Alicia.

605
01:05:32,829 --> 01:05:35,320
You will photograph
and record my work.

606
01:05:35,565 --> 01:05:39,899
You will join me in the
avant-garde of the new aesthetic.

607
01:05:40,336 --> 01:05:44,670
Jack, you said I could watch
you improve the paintings.

608
01:05:45,174 --> 01:05:47,506
I'm in trouble now.

609
01:05:48,244 --> 01:05:50,235
Why is she wearing a mask?

610
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:52,841
She's just a sketch, really.

611
01:05:53,082 --> 01:05:56,745
Alicia, sit down. Show the
lady why you wear this mask.

612
01:05:57,019 --> 01:06:00,921
Alicia's been made over in
line with my new philosophy.

613
01:06:01,190 --> 01:06:02,748
So now, like me...

614
01:06:03,092 --> 01:06:05,356
...she is a living work of art.

615
01:06:09,765 --> 01:06:12,256
I'm no Picasso, but...do you like it?

616
01:06:13,769 --> 01:06:15,031
It's great.

617
01:06:16,205 --> 01:06:18,867
So...what can I do for you?

618
01:06:19,208 --> 01:06:22,268
A little song, a little dance.

619
01:06:22,545 --> 01:06:24,604
Batman's head on a lance.

620
01:06:24,881 --> 01:06:26,940
What do you know about...?

621
01:06:27,717 --> 01:06:29,116
I don't know anything.

622
01:06:31,053 --> 01:06:32,384
Really?

623
01:06:32,955 --> 01:06:35,287
Well, how about
a little "you and me"?

624
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:38,949
You're insane.

625
01:06:39,462 --> 01:06:41,555
I thought I was a Pisces. Come on.

626
01:06:41,797 --> 01:06:44,459
Let's make up. Have a little...

627
01:06:44,734 --> 01:06:46,565
...whiff of my posy.

628
01:06:52,408 --> 01:06:53,807
Help me!

629
01:06:54,744 --> 01:06:56,143
I'm melting!

630
01:06:56,913 --> 01:06:59,643
I'm melting! Help me! I'm melting!

631
01:07:23,439 --> 01:07:24,770
Hold on.

632
01:07:33,950 --> 01:07:36,942
Where does he get
those wonderful toys?

633
01:07:39,855 --> 01:07:41,618
-Get in the car.
-Which one?

634
01:09:07,343 --> 01:09:08,332
Let's go.

635
01:09:23,526 --> 01:09:24,515
Shields.

636
01:09:49,885 --> 01:09:51,375
How much do you weigh?

637
01:09:51,721 --> 01:09:53,382
About 108, I think.

638
01:10:02,498 --> 01:10:03,726
Hold on.

639
01:10:14,410 --> 01:10:16,401
Grab that thing on my belt.

640
01:10:16,846 --> 01:10:17,835
Don't let go.

641
01:10:32,862 --> 01:10:33,851
No blood.

642
01:10:34,096 --> 01:10:35,586
Who is this guy?

643
01:10:35,765 --> 01:10:36,925
Check his wallet.

644
01:10:38,534 --> 01:10:41,094
-Wait.
-What is that?

645
01:10:41,370 --> 01:10:44,931
Some kind of body armor.
He's human after all.

646
01:10:45,274 --> 01:10:46,536
Take off the mask.

647
01:10:52,882 --> 01:10:53,940
Shoot her!

648
01:11:56,946 --> 01:11:58,174
Shields open.

649
01:12:23,205 --> 01:12:24,968
You weigh more than 108.

650
01:12:25,207 --> 01:12:27,232
-Really?
-Let's go.

651
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:32,811
Stop.

652
01:13:01,677 --> 01:13:03,235
Where are we going?

653
01:14:22,825 --> 01:14:24,258
Be careful.

654
01:14:33,168 --> 01:14:34,328
Bats.

655
01:14:35,938 --> 01:14:37,496
They're great survivors.

656
01:15:02,965 --> 01:15:05,866
-What is all this?
-The police have got it wrong.

657
01:15:06,535 --> 01:15:08,628
They're looking for one product.

658
01:15:08,871 --> 01:15:12,034
The Joker's tainted hundreds
of chemicals at the source.

659
01:15:14,209 --> 01:15:16,871
Then whole shipments
would be poisoned.

660
01:15:17,146 --> 01:15:18,807
And we'd all be dead.

661
01:15:19,815 --> 01:15:21,305
No.

662
01:15:21,550 --> 01:15:26,214
The poison works when components
are mixed. Hairspray won't do it alone.

663
01:15:26,488 --> 01:15:30,982
But hairspray mixed with lipstick and
perfume will be toxic, and traceable.

664
01:15:31,660 --> 01:15:33,821
How did you figure this out?

665
01:15:39,835 --> 01:15:41,325
Take that to the press.

666
01:15:42,571 --> 01:15:44,664
I might have trouble with that.

667
01:15:45,741 --> 01:15:48,904
A lot of people think you're
as dangerous as the Joker.

668
01:15:50,245 --> 01:15:51,906
He's psychotic.

669
01:15:53,015 --> 01:15:55,745
Some people say the
same thing about you.

670
01:15:56,919 --> 01:15:58,079
What people?

671
01:15:59,088 --> 01:16:01,249
Well, let's face it.

672
01:16:02,691 --> 01:16:05,854
You're not exactly normal...are you?

673
01:16:06,595 --> 01:16:08,586
It's not exactly a normal world.

674
01:16:08,931 --> 01:16:10,694
Why did you bring me here?

675
01:16:11,033 --> 01:16:14,366
You could have sent that
stuff to the press yourself.

676
01:16:15,037 --> 01:16:16,197
You're right.

677
01:16:17,706 --> 01:16:20,106
There is something
you have that I want.

678
01:16:20,609 --> 01:16:21,701
What?

679
01:16:43,899 --> 01:16:45,730
He took the film.

680
01:16:51,406 --> 01:16:54,739
Where have you been? Are
you okay? Should I come over?

681
01:16:54,977 --> 01:16:57,070
No, Allie.

682
01:16:57,746 --> 01:17:01,147
If I bring something to you,
can we make the evening edition?

683
01:17:02,818 --> 01:17:04,479
Just barely. Is it hot?

684
01:17:05,487 --> 01:17:07,819
Yeah, it's real hot.

685
01:17:09,992 --> 01:17:10,981
Copy!

686
01:17:23,005 --> 01:17:25,337
Avoid the following combinations:

687
01:17:25,574 --> 01:17:29,066
Deodorants with baby powder,
hairspray, and lipstick.

688
01:17:29,745 --> 01:17:33,909
Safe products are flying in as
Gotham City goes on a forced fast.

689
01:17:34,183 --> 01:17:37,346
And all of Gotham is wondering
what to make of Batman.

690
01:17:37,586 --> 01:17:39,247
Friend or foe?

691
01:17:40,856 --> 01:17:43,188
I have given a name to my pain...

692
01:17:44,359 --> 01:17:46,350
...and it is Batman.

693
01:17:51,366 --> 01:17:54,699
You must possess strength
to inflict pain, Bob.

694
01:17:55,103 --> 01:17:57,594
We've got a flying mouse to kill...

695
01:17:57,873 --> 01:18:00,535
...and I want to clean my claws.

696
01:18:05,447 --> 01:18:08,109
Sir, Miss Vale called again.

697
01:18:08,550 --> 01:18:11,610
Dare I suggest that your
present course of action...

698
01:18:11,887 --> 01:18:13,946
...might simply
strengthen her resolve?

699
01:18:14,556 --> 01:18:16,717
She is quite tenacious.

700
01:18:17,559 --> 01:18:18,719
You're right.

701
01:18:18,961 --> 01:18:23,455
And quite special. Perhaps you
could try telling her the truth.

702
01:18:34,076 --> 01:18:35,407
Coming.

703
01:18:49,491 --> 01:18:50,321
May I come in?

704
01:19:00,669 --> 01:19:02,330
This is a nice apartment.

705
01:19:04,506 --> 01:19:05,996
Lots of space.

706
01:19:11,446 --> 01:19:13,277
Listen, I came over to...

707
01:19:13,682 --> 01:19:16,446
-...clear--
-I don't know who you think you are!

708
01:19:16,685 --> 01:19:18,346
-You hurt me.
-I know.

709
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:23,284
I called you and called you. And you
lied! You lied about leaving town.

710
01:19:23,458 --> 01:19:25,790
-Let me tell you why.
-Let me tell you!

711
01:19:26,028 --> 01:19:29,520
I thought we felt something.
And I trusted you.

712
01:19:29,798 --> 01:19:31,459
I even slept with you.

713
01:19:31,633 --> 01:19:35,296
Then you wouldn't return my calls.
You must be some kind of jerk.

714
01:19:36,371 --> 01:19:40,364
You're a real nice girl and I like
you a lot, but right now, shut up.

715
01:19:41,710 --> 01:19:43,541
I have something to tell you.

716
01:19:51,820 --> 01:19:56,154
You know how people have...
different sides to their personality?

717
01:19:57,993 --> 01:19:59,483
Sometimes...

718
01:20:00,329 --> 01:20:04,322
...a person will have to actually
lead a different life.

719
01:20:04,900 --> 01:20:06,561
Oh, my God, you're married.

720
01:20:07,235 --> 01:20:09,066
No, I'm not married.

721
01:20:16,244 --> 01:20:17,404
You see...

722
01:20:18,847 --> 01:20:21,077
...my life is really...

723
01:20:24,419 --> 01:20:25,408
...complex.

724
01:20:28,757 --> 01:20:33,421
All right, listen. You know how
a normal person gets up and...

725
01:20:34,863 --> 01:20:36,854
...goes downstairs...

726
01:20:37,099 --> 01:20:38,930
...and eats breakfast...

727
01:20:39,267 --> 01:20:42,759
...and kisses somebody
good-bye, and goes to...

728
01:20:43,538 --> 01:20:45,768
...a job, and, you know.

729
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:53,108
Look.

730
01:20:56,785 --> 01:20:59,117
What I'm trying to tell you is...

731
01:21:00,889 --> 01:21:03,050
Hey, it's okay.

732
01:21:03,291 --> 01:21:04,781
You can tell me.

733
01:21:10,065 --> 01:21:12,056
What I'm trying to tell you is...

734
01:21:15,137 --> 01:21:16,798
I'll be right back.

735
01:21:27,749 --> 01:21:28,909
Miss me?

736
01:21:34,589 --> 01:21:37,922
Nice place you got here. Lots of space.

737
01:21:39,327 --> 01:21:41,818
Vicki, we've really got to talk.

738
01:21:45,834 --> 01:21:47,665
We were having dinner.

739
01:21:48,603 --> 01:21:51,936
I was a man doing well
with a beautiful woman.

740
01:21:52,507 --> 01:21:54,998
And without so much as an apology...

741
01:21:55,277 --> 01:21:59,509
...you ran off with that
sideshow phony.

742
01:22:04,286 --> 01:22:05,446
You know...

743
01:22:07,689 --> 01:22:10,624
...l've recently had
a tragedy in my life.

744
01:22:10,859 --> 01:22:12,292
Alicia...

745
01:22:13,462 --> 01:22:15,521
...threw herself out a window.

746
01:22:15,797 --> 01:22:16,855
Oh, my God.

747
01:22:19,634 --> 01:22:20,965
But...

748
01:22:21,470 --> 01:22:24,633
...you can't make an omelet
without breaking eggs.

749
01:22:36,051 --> 01:22:37,643
Well, Miss Vale...

750
01:22:38,386 --> 01:22:41,048
...another rooster in the hen-house?

751
01:22:43,892 --> 01:22:46,884
Take thy beak from out my heart.

752
01:22:53,235 --> 01:22:56,329
Bruce...Wayne, n'est-ce pas?

753
01:22:58,740 --> 01:22:59,900
Most of the time.

754
01:23:06,414 --> 01:23:07,904
I know you.

755
01:23:11,086 --> 01:23:13,680
Let me tell you
about this guy I know.

756
01:23:14,589 --> 01:23:17,922
Mean kid. Bad seed. Hurt people.

757
01:23:18,426 --> 01:23:20,257
I like him already.

758
01:23:23,598 --> 01:23:25,862
You know what the problem was?

759
01:23:26,201 --> 01:23:29,193
He got sloppy. You know, crazy.

760
01:23:29,538 --> 01:23:33,872
He started to lose it. He had a
head full of bad wiring, I guess.

761
01:23:34,109 --> 01:23:36,600
Couldn't keep it straight up here.

762
01:23:37,946 --> 01:23:40,210
He was the kind of guy who...

763
01:23:41,449 --> 01:23:44,782
...couldn't hear the train
until it was two feet from him.

764
01:23:49,457 --> 01:23:51,550
You know what happened
to this guy?

765
01:23:56,464 --> 01:23:58,398
He made mistakes.

766
01:23:59,901 --> 01:24:03,632
Then he ended up with his lights out!
Now you want to get nuts?

767
01:24:03,905 --> 01:24:05,566
Come on! Let's get nuts!

768
01:24:07,142 --> 01:24:08,632
Tell me something.

769
01:24:10,412 --> 01:24:12,903
You ever dance with the
devil in the pale moonlight?

770
01:24:13,982 --> 01:24:14,914
What?

771
01:24:15,317 --> 01:24:17,979
I always ask that of all my prey.

772
01:24:18,653 --> 01:24:20,484
I just like the sound of it.

773
01:24:26,661 --> 01:24:29,152
Never rub another man's rhubarb.

774
01:24:36,271 --> 01:24:40,105
Why is it every time I come for you...

775
01:24:41,109 --> 01:24:43,339
...somebody always gets in the way?

776
01:24:43,678 --> 01:24:45,839
I'll need a moment alone.

777
01:24:48,683 --> 01:24:51,345
I'm only laughing on the outside.

778
01:24:52,287 --> 01:24:55,347
My smile is just skin deep.

779
01:24:56,524 --> 01:24:58,185
If you could see inside...

780
01:24:58,526 --> 01:25:00,517
...l'm really crying.

781
01:25:01,529 --> 01:25:03,690
You might join me for a weep.

782
01:25:48,510 --> 01:25:50,671
You really wouldn't believe it.

783
01:25:51,012 --> 01:25:55,847
While you were entertaining, I've been
finding out about your street corner.

784
01:25:59,854 --> 01:26:02,345
I think your friend is screwed up.

785
01:26:03,258 --> 01:26:04,850
More good news.

786
01:26:12,934 --> 01:26:14,595
Oh, my God!

787
01:26:15,103 --> 01:26:17,435
His parents were murdered
in that alley.

788
01:26:18,373 --> 01:26:20,364
That's why he went there.

789
01:26:24,946 --> 01:26:27,608
He watched it happen in front of him.

790
01:26:28,116 --> 01:26:29,947
Look at the look on his face.

791
01:26:30,552 --> 01:26:32,884
It was the same at City Hall.

792
01:26:34,456 --> 01:26:37,050
What do you suppose
this does to a kid?

793
01:26:42,797 --> 01:26:44,788
Don't get personal!

794
01:26:58,713 --> 01:27:00,704
The file on my parents?

795
01:27:01,382 --> 01:27:03,043
It's on your table.

796
01:27:11,793 --> 01:27:13,454
What's on your mind?

797
01:27:15,563 --> 01:27:19,556
I have no wish to fill my
few remaining years...

798
01:27:19,968 --> 01:27:22,300
...grieving for old friends...

799
01:27:26,574 --> 01:27:28,405
...or their sons.

800
01:27:46,594 --> 01:27:51,258
The 200th anniversary birthday gala
has been indefinitely postponed.

801
01:27:51,766 --> 01:27:53,757
We cannot guarantee public safety.

802
01:27:54,002 --> 01:27:55,663
Joker here.

803
01:27:55,970 --> 01:27:57,301
We got interference.

804
01:27:57,605 --> 01:28:01,097
Now you fellows have said
some pretty mean things.

805
01:28:01,342 --> 01:28:04,778
Some of which were true
under that fiend...

806
01:28:05,013 --> 01:28:06,344
...Boss Grissom.

807
01:28:06,614 --> 01:28:09,447
He was a thief...and a terrorist.

808
01:28:09,684 --> 01:28:13,347
On the other hand, he had
a tremendous singing voice.

809
01:28:13,621 --> 01:28:17,455
He's dead now, and he's
left me in charge.

810
01:28:20,795 --> 01:28:23,127
I can be theatrical...

811
01:28:23,464 --> 01:28:25,955
...and maybe even a little rough.

812
01:28:26,467 --> 01:28:28,867
But one thing I am not...

813
01:28:29,204 --> 01:28:30,694
...is a killer!

814
01:28:35,376 --> 01:28:37,037
I love a good party.

815
01:28:37,312 --> 01:28:38,870
So, truce.

816
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:42,643
Commence au festival!

817
01:28:43,718 --> 01:28:46,710
And I've got a surprise
for Gotham City.

818
01:28:47,722 --> 01:28:52,056
At midnight, I will dump
20 million in cash...

819
01:28:52,360 --> 01:28:53,691
...on the crowd.

820
01:28:56,831 --> 01:28:59,231
Don't worry about me.
I've got enough.

821
01:28:59,500 --> 01:29:02,560
We are not prepared
to discuss any deals.

822
01:29:05,006 --> 01:29:07,338
You heard it, folks, 20 million.

823
01:29:08,076 --> 01:29:10,067
And there will be entertainment.

824
01:29:10,645 --> 01:29:15,309
The big dukeroo. With me in one
corner, and in the other corner...

825
01:29:15,917 --> 01:29:20,183
...the man who has brought
real terror to Gotham City...

826
01:29:20,588 --> 01:29:22,078
...Batman.

827
01:29:22,590 --> 01:29:24,080
Can you hear me?

828
01:29:24,759 --> 01:29:26,249
Just the two of us.

829
01:29:26,527 --> 01:29:28,518
Mano y mano.

830
01:29:29,530 --> 01:29:31,930
I have taken off my make-up.

831
01:29:32,934 --> 01:29:34,526
Let's see...

832
01:29:34,769 --> 01:29:37,704
...if you can take off yours.

833
01:31:49,904 --> 01:31:51,895
Tell me, kid.

834
01:31:52,407 --> 01:31:56,901
Did you ever dance with the
devil by the pale moonlight?

835
01:32:04,685 --> 01:32:06,243
Let's go!

836
01:32:09,190 --> 01:32:10,851
Let's go, Jack!

837
01:32:14,529 --> 01:32:16,087
See you around.

838
01:32:45,893 --> 01:32:47,724
Am I crazy?

839
01:32:50,064 --> 01:32:53,295
That wasn't just another night
for either of us, was it?

840
01:32:56,804 --> 01:32:59,796
We both got to each other, didn't we?

841
01:33:02,743 --> 01:33:04,904
Why won't you let me in?

842
01:33:10,084 --> 01:33:11,574
You got in.

843
01:33:16,424 --> 01:33:18,483
I've loved you since I met you.

844
01:33:19,994 --> 01:33:23,327
But I don't know what
to think of all this.

845
01:33:23,598 --> 01:33:28,262
Sometimes I don't know, either.
It's just something I have to do.

846
01:33:28,503 --> 01:33:29,834
Why?

847
01:33:30,438 --> 01:33:32,269
Because nobody else can.

848
01:33:35,610 --> 01:33:38,443
I tried to avoid all this, but I can't.

849
01:33:38,846 --> 01:33:40,677
This is how it is.

850
01:33:41,449 --> 01:33:43,110
It's not a perfect world.

851
01:33:43,451 --> 01:33:46,284
It doesn't have to be a perfect world.

852
01:33:50,458 --> 01:33:54,622
I just have to know, are we
going to try to love each other?

853
01:33:58,032 --> 01:33:59,465
I'd like to.

854
01:34:00,968 --> 01:34:02,868
But he's out there right now.

855
01:34:03,371 --> 01:34:05,134
And I've got to go to work.

856
01:35:47,908 --> 01:35:49,967
Into the air, Junior Birdman!

857
01:35:50,144 --> 01:35:51,475
Missed me!

858
01:35:52,980 --> 01:35:54,914
Yeah! Watch me!

859
01:38:16,157 --> 01:38:18,751
Get them. Take the pictures.

860
01:38:19,827 --> 01:38:21,158
Gotham's greed.

861
01:38:49,857 --> 01:38:51,620
And now, folks...

862
01:38:51,859 --> 01:38:54,293
...it's time for, "Who Do You Trust?"

863
01:38:54,562 --> 01:38:57,190
Money, money! Who do you trust?

864
01:38:57,465 --> 01:39:00,298
Me? I'm giving away free money.

865
01:39:00,968 --> 01:39:03,869
And where...is the Batman?

866
01:39:05,306 --> 01:39:08,298
He's at home, washing his tights.

867
01:39:16,383 --> 01:39:20,820
Winged battle flies through
the night and finds me ready.

868
01:39:21,088 --> 01:39:23,079
Bob. Mask.

869
01:39:23,891 --> 01:39:25,882
Masks! Put them on now!

870
01:39:26,727 --> 01:39:28,217
And now...

871
01:39:29,597 --> 01:39:31,224
...comes the part...

872
01:39:31,832 --> 01:39:34,665
...where I relieve you,
the little people...

873
01:39:34,902 --> 01:39:37,598
...of the burden...of your failed...

874
01:39:37,905 --> 01:39:39,600
...and useless lives.

875
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:43,833
But, as my plastic surgeon always
said, "If you got to go...

876
01:39:44,245 --> 01:39:46,110
...go with a smile."

877
01:40:17,144 --> 01:40:18,042
My God.

878
01:40:19,046 --> 01:40:20,377
Smylex gas.

879
01:40:20,881 --> 01:40:22,542
He's going to kill everybody!

880
01:40:22,716 --> 01:40:25,446
Get in the car. Get in the car!

881
01:40:33,727 --> 01:40:35,024
Hurry!

882
01:42:26,674 --> 01:42:27,834
My balloons!

883
01:42:38,519 --> 01:42:39,850
They're my balloons!

884
01:43:06,814 --> 01:43:08,941
He stole my balloons!

885
01:43:09,883 --> 01:43:14,047
Why didn't somebody tell me he
had one of those...things?!

886
01:43:15,723 --> 01:43:17,714
Bob. Gun.

887
01:43:24,231 --> 01:43:26,722
I'll need a minute or two alone, boys.

888
01:43:27,067 --> 01:43:28,898
Get out of here!

889
01:44:21,121 --> 01:44:24,784
Come on, you gruesome son-of-a-bitch.
Come to me.

890
01:46:01,989 --> 01:46:03,320
Darling.

891
01:46:05,492 --> 01:46:08,427
I've got to get you to
the church on time.

892
01:46:14,167 --> 01:46:17,603
Gotham City Cathedral.
Transportation for two.

893
01:46:17,838 --> 01:46:20,170
-Right away, sir?
-Five minutes.

894
01:46:25,612 --> 01:46:26,909
Better make it ten.

895
01:49:58,892 --> 01:50:00,052
Let's go.

896
01:50:08,001 --> 01:50:11,334
Point those searchlights
at the tower. Now! Move!

897
01:50:41,701 --> 01:50:45,694
It can be truly said that
I have a bat in my belfry.

898
01:50:54,781 --> 01:50:56,271
Shall we dance?

899
01:52:18,298 --> 01:52:20,459
You know, without you...

900
01:52:21,368 --> 01:52:24,201
...l just wouldn't want to go on.

901
01:53:47,954 --> 01:53:50,445
We were made for each other.

902
01:53:50,890 --> 01:53:53,051
Beauty and the Beast.

903
01:53:53,793 --> 01:53:56,557
Of course, if anyone
calls you "Beast"...

904
01:53:56,796 --> 01:53:59,128
...l'll rip their lungs out.

905
01:54:29,829 --> 01:54:31,319
Mr. Joker?

906
01:54:35,101 --> 01:54:37,592
You say such beautiful things.

907
01:54:39,005 --> 01:54:42,099
And you're so powerful.
And purple!

908
01:54:43,943 --> 01:54:45,103
I love purple!

909
01:54:48,515 --> 01:54:49,675
Excuse me.

910
01:54:50,183 --> 01:54:52,617
Ever dance with the devil
in the pale moonlight?

911
01:54:57,190 --> 01:54:58,350
I'm going to kill you.

912
01:54:59,292 --> 01:55:00,953
You idiot!

913
01:55:01,461 --> 01:55:03,520
You made me, remember?!

914
01:55:03,797 --> 01:55:05,788
You dropped me into the chemicals!

915
01:55:06,032 --> 01:55:10,196
That wasn't easy to get over!
And don't think I didn't try.

916
01:55:10,470 --> 01:55:11,698
I know you did.

917
01:55:39,566 --> 01:55:40,999
You killed my parents.

918
01:55:41,234 --> 01:55:42,394
What?

919
01:55:44,571 --> 01:55:45,560
What are you saying?

920
01:55:46,406 --> 01:55:49,068
I made you, but you made me first.

921
01:55:50,677 --> 01:55:52,338
I was just a kid.

922
01:55:52,512 --> 01:55:55,003
I say you made me,
you say I made you.

923
01:55:55,248 --> 01:55:57,409
How childish can you get?

924
01:55:57,684 --> 01:56:00,244
You wouldn't hit a guy
with glasses on.

925
01:56:16,603 --> 01:56:18,434
What are you laughing at?

926
01:56:25,612 --> 01:56:27,671
Let me lend you a hand.

927
01:56:35,788 --> 01:56:37,119
Lend you a hand!

928
01:56:44,797 --> 01:56:47,459
They don't make them
like they used to!

929
01:56:51,371 --> 01:56:52,804
Hey, Batsy!

930
01:57:06,486 --> 01:57:08,215
There he is! Down there!

931
01:57:22,201 --> 01:57:23,532
It's time to retire.

932
01:57:25,338 --> 01:57:27,670
Feel free to drop in.

933
01:57:36,916 --> 01:57:39,578
Sometimes I just kill myself!

934
01:57:44,857 --> 01:57:46,085
Hold on!

935
01:59:57,156 --> 02:00:01,650
Our police have rounded up
all of the Joker's men.

936
02:00:01,994 --> 02:00:04,155
The reign of crime is over.

937
02:00:04,664 --> 02:00:08,156
Public safety in Gotham City is
no longer a laughing matter.

938
02:00:08,401 --> 02:00:10,995
Aren't you covering
the press conference?

939
02:00:12,071 --> 02:00:14,062
What about our Pulitzer Prize?

940
02:00:14,741 --> 02:00:16,174
What about us?

941
02:00:17,076 --> 02:00:18,737
What about your picture of Batman?

942
02:00:27,754 --> 02:00:28,846
Take care.

943
02:00:31,858 --> 02:00:34,190
We received a letter from Batman.

944
02:00:36,429 --> 02:00:38,863
"Please inform
the citizens of Gotham...

945
02:00:39,098 --> 02:00:41,931
...that Gotham City's
earned a rest from crime.

946
02:00:42,869 --> 02:00:46,202
But if the forces of evil
should rise again...

947
02:00:46,539 --> 02:00:49,440
...to cast a shadow on
the heart of the city.

948
02:00:49,876 --> 02:00:51,207
Call me."

949
02:00:51,544 --> 02:00:54,206
Question. How do we call him?

950
02:00:59,385 --> 02:01:01,216
He gave us a signal.

951
02:01:36,823 --> 02:01:39,815
I thought champagne
would be in order, ma'am.

952
02:01:40,159 --> 02:01:41,490
Hi, Alfred.

953
02:01:50,503 --> 02:01:52,266
Mr. Wayne told me to tell you...

954
02:01:52,438 --> 02:01:54,429
...that he might be a little late.

955
02:01:57,343 --> 02:01:59,607
I'm not a bit surprised.
