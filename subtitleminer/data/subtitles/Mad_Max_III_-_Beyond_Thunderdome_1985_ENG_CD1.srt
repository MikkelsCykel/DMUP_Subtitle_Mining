1
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,581
Bull's-eye!
-You bet, Dad!

2
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:11,467
You go straight home.

3
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,211
Bombs away!

4
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:31,889
Sayonara, sucker!

5
00:05:37,653 --> 00:05:40,747
No preservatives, just pure water!

6
00:05:41,224 --> 00:05:43,454
Cool, clear water.

7
00:05:43,726 --> 00:05:46,286
Step up, schmuck, get some dealing done.

8
00:05:46,529 --> 00:05:48,429
H20, that's my go.

9
00:05:48,764 --> 00:05:52,723
Don't you understand? This is water.
You can't live without it.

10
00:05:56,906 --> 00:05:59,340
What's a little fallout, huh?

11
00:06:18,894 --> 00:06:20,521
You get a sack of grain

12
00:06:20,796 --> 00:06:23,196
...or a woman for 2 hours.

13
00:06:30,906 --> 00:06:33,170
What are you trading?
-I'm looking for someone.

14
00:06:33,409 --> 00:06:34,637
Are you trading or not?

15
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:36,377
He had a team of camels.

16
00:06:36,679 --> 00:06:41,514
People come here to trade, make a little
profit, do a little business.

17
00:06:42,418 --> 00:06:45,251
If you've nothing to trade,
you've no business here.

18
00:06:45,421 --> 00:06:46,445
An hour inside.

19
00:06:46,789 --> 00:06:47,756
Next!

20
00:06:48,224 --> 00:06:49,748
I got skills I can trade.

21
00:06:50,559 --> 00:06:52,527
Sorry. The brothel's full.

22
00:07:10,946 --> 00:07:12,345
One hour.

23
00:07:12,581 --> 00:07:15,550
And if you find him?
-I'll ask him to return what's mine.

24
00:07:15,851 --> 00:07:18,547
And he'll be desperate
to clear his conscience.

25
00:07:18,821 --> 00:07:19,753
He will be.

26
00:07:20,456 --> 00:07:22,117
You that good?

27
00:07:24,593 --> 00:07:27,391
Perhaps
you have something to trade after all.

28
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:28,789
Keep talking.

29
00:07:29,565 --> 00:07:31,658
24 hours of your life.

30
00:07:32,301 --> 00:07:34,826
In return,
you'll get back what was stolen.

31
00:07:35,571 --> 00:07:37,129
Sounds like a bargain.

32
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,501
It's not. Let's talk. Come inside.

33
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:58,316
Leave your weapons here. It's the law.

34
00:09:31,554 --> 00:09:35,923
Remember, this is the vehicle
that sent Detroit broke.

35
00:09:37,693 --> 00:09:39,490
Where did you get these animals?

36
00:09:39,762 --> 00:09:42,663
The glorious dromedary.
The ship of the desert.

37
00:09:43,132 --> 00:09:47,796
They got independent suspension power
steering and no emission control.

38
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,601
Ride them away now.

39
00:11:09,785 --> 00:11:11,184
A warrior, Aunty.

40
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:14,890
Lost everything. Looking for a deal.

41
00:11:19,328 --> 00:11:21,455
But he's just a raggedy man.

42
00:11:22,498 --> 00:11:23,726
He's quick.

43
00:11:24,567 --> 00:11:25,556
Ironbar...

44
00:11:25,868 --> 00:11:27,392
...can he do it?

45
00:11:28,637 --> 00:11:29,626
Maybe.

46
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,474
What did you do before this?

47
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,874
I was a cop, a driver.

48
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,853
But how the world turns.

49
00:11:46,255 --> 00:11:48,780
One day cock of the walk,
next, a feather duster.

50
00:11:49,258 --> 00:11:51,886
Play something tragic, Ton Ton.

51
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:58,823
Do you know who I was?

52
00:11:59,668 --> 00:12:00,760
Nobody.

53
00:12:01,537 --> 00:12:04,768
Except on the day after,
I was still alive.

54
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:08,333
This nobody had a chance
to be somebody.

55
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:14,215
<i>So much for history. Anyway...
Water? Fruit?</i>

56
00:13:04,133 --> 00:13:07,261
Congratulations. You're the first
to survive the audition.

57
00:13:14,743 --> 00:13:15,835
Drink.

58
00:13:17,312 --> 00:13:18,506
It's okay.

59
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:31,484
Come with me.

60
00:13:35,464 --> 00:13:38,126
Look around. All this I built.

61
00:13:39,702 --> 00:13:42,296
Up to my armpits in blood and shit.

62
00:13:43,505 --> 00:13:45,769
Where there was desert,
now there's a town.

63
00:13:46,608 --> 00:13:48,576
Where there was robbery, there's trade.

64
00:13:49,478 --> 00:13:52,311
Where there was despair,
now there's hope.

65
00:13:52,781 --> 00:13:54,305
It's civilization.

66
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:57,316
I'll do anything to protect it.

67
00:14:00,155 --> 00:14:03,454
Today it's necessary to kill a man.
What do you say?

68
00:14:05,661 --> 00:14:06,753
What do you pay?

69
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:12,291
I'll re-equip you... vehicles, animals.
Fuel, if you want.

70
00:14:12,568 --> 00:14:14,126
It's a generous offer.

71
00:14:14,303 --> 00:14:17,466
Why me? You've got warriors, weapons.
Give the order.

72
00:14:17,906 --> 00:14:20,534
We are dealing with subtleties here.

73
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:23,343
This is no enemy. It's almost family.

74
00:14:23,912 --> 00:14:25,743
I see, real civilized.

75
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:30,214
The reasons don't concern you,
just the conditions. Deal?

76
00:14:32,654 --> 00:14:35,589
First, no one knows you're working
for Aunty.

77
00:14:35,924 --> 00:14:38,188
You hit him, you go.

78
00:14:38,494 --> 00:14:40,758
Second, it's a fair fight.

79
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:43,460
And third, it's to the death.

80
00:14:46,668 --> 00:14:47,896
Who's the bunny?

81
00:15:23,939 --> 00:15:27,568
We call it Underworld.
It's where Bartertown gets its energy.

82
00:15:28,277 --> 00:15:29,676
Oil, natural gas?

83
00:15:30,145 --> 00:15:31,407
Pigs.

84
00:15:31,947 --> 00:15:33,608
Pigs like those?

85
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:37,250
Bullshit.
-Pigshit.

86
00:15:37,719 --> 00:15:41,519
Pigshit.
The lights, the motors, the vehicles...

87
00:15:41,824 --> 00:15:45,385
...all run by a high-powered gas
called methane.

88
00:15:46,295 --> 00:15:48,661
Methane comes from pigshit.

89
00:15:50,299 --> 00:15:52,790
Have a look. Tell me what you see.

90
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:58,264
I see a big guy
giving a little guy a piggy back.

91
00:15:58,907 --> 00:16:01,398
MasterBlaster. They're a unit.

92
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:03,635
They even share the same name.

93
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:07,713
The little one is called Master.
He's the brains.

94
00:16:08,183 --> 00:16:10,151
He runs Underworld.

95
00:16:10,619 --> 00:16:14,248
The other one is Blaster.
He's the muscle.

96
00:16:14,756 --> 00:16:17,281
Together they can be very powerful.

97
00:16:20,162 --> 00:16:22,289
They are also arrogant.

98
00:16:23,265 --> 00:16:26,564
We want to keep the brain,
dump the body.

99
00:16:26,835 --> 00:16:28,666
He's big. Is he good?

100
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:32,567
He can beat most men with his breath.

101
00:16:32,841 --> 00:16:35,537
I want a closer look at him.
How do I get in there?

102
00:16:35,777 --> 00:16:38,803
It's a factory. Ask for work.
-I know nothing about methane.

103
00:16:40,215 --> 00:16:42,115
You can shovel shit, can't you?

104
00:17:29,831 --> 00:17:31,321
Hey, you!

105
00:17:31,934 --> 00:17:33,333
Let's talk!

106
00:17:37,239 --> 00:17:41,369
Here, free man, come help a convict.
You don't want to end up like me.

107
00:17:41,777 --> 00:17:43,335
How long are you in for?

108
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,510
The big one. Life.

109
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:48,138
For killing a pig?

110
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:50,518
I had to feed the kids.

111
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:54,755
Doesn't worry me. Down here
life's two, three years.

112
00:18:08,403 --> 00:18:11,668
Where is that bum mechanic Blackfinger?

113
00:18:22,718 --> 00:18:24,549
We got a real problem.

114
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:27,311
Twelve pounds of dynamite set to blow.

115
00:18:28,557 --> 00:18:31,082
You expert! Disarm!

116
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:49,268
It's a class Job. One mistake,
it'll blow the crap out of this place.

117
00:18:49,544 --> 00:18:50,408
Literally.

118
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:52,146
Think what to do!

119
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:58,413
Now... the dynamite is connected
to the timing device...

120
00:18:58,754 --> 00:19:01,689
...which is connected to the switch,
which I can't find...

121
00:19:02,157 --> 00:19:05,092
...which is connected to the...

122
00:19:05,494 --> 00:19:06,426
...battery.

123
00:19:06,828 --> 00:19:08,295
I'll disconnect the battery!

124
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:10,088
I wouldn't do that.

125
00:19:12,467 --> 00:19:12,489
Who you?

126
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:15,165
Me Max.

127
00:19:15,337 --> 00:19:16,167
You smart.

128
00:19:16,605 --> 00:19:17,867
That's my vehicle.

129
00:19:18,273 --> 00:19:19,297
Disarm!

130
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:20,730
How much?

131
00:19:21,209 --> 00:19:23,439
No trade. Do!

132
00:19:25,614 --> 00:19:26,273
Fetch!

133
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:35,385
Me order. Me Master!

134
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:38,222
Me run Bartertown!

135
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,591
That's why you live in shit.

136
00:19:40,896 --> 00:19:42,864
Not shit! Energy!

137
00:19:43,632 --> 00:19:46,294
Call it what you like,
it still smells like shit.

138
00:19:46,635 --> 00:19:50,731
Not shit! Energy!
No energy, no town!

139
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:53,399
Me King Arab!

140
00:19:53,642 --> 00:19:55,473
Sure. Me, fairy princess.

141
00:19:55,844 --> 00:19:57,607
Embargo, on!

142
00:20:17,866 --> 00:20:20,733
Embargo on! Main valve off!

143
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:39,116
<i>4, 3, 2...</i>

144
00:20:39,855 --> 00:20:41,550
For God's sake, what now?

145
00:20:42,457 --> 00:20:44,687
Who run Bartertown?

146
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:47,818
Damn it!
I told you, no more embargos.

147
00:20:50,565 --> 00:20:51,497
More, Blaster.

148
00:20:59,274 --> 00:21:00,571
Who run Bartertown?

149
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:07,315
Who run Bartertown?

150
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:09,577
You know who.

151
00:21:10,218 --> 00:21:11,276
Say.

152
00:21:12,454 --> 00:21:13,853
MasterBlaster.

153
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:16,853
Say loud.

154
00:21:19,661 --> 00:21:20,855
MasterBlaster.

155
00:21:21,897 --> 00:21:24,422
MasterBlaster what?

156
00:21:26,902 --> 00:21:29,735
MasterBlaster runs Bartertown.

157
00:21:30,238 --> 00:21:31,603
Louder!

158
00:21:32,774 --> 00:21:35,607
MasterBlaster runs Bartertown.

159
00:21:36,244 --> 00:21:38,337
Lift embargo.

160
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,633
You want foot in face?

161
00:22:09,277 --> 00:22:10,642
Disarm.

162
00:22:11,813 --> 00:22:13,508
Good boy.

163
00:22:49,551 --> 00:22:50,381
Over here, Blaster.

164
00:23:19,748 --> 00:23:22,273
What are you laying for?
-Nothing.

165
00:23:22,617 --> 00:23:24,084
Who are you?
-Nobody.

166
00:23:24,286 --> 00:23:25,947
No, mister, I can feel it.
The dice are rolling!

167
00:23:34,429 --> 00:23:37,694
I want my camels, my vehicle,
food, water, methane.

168
00:23:39,834 --> 00:23:40,664
Deal.

169
00:23:40,869 --> 00:23:43,269
You said a fair fight.
What does that mean?

170
00:23:43,471 --> 00:23:45,564
As provided by law.

171
00:23:46,207 --> 00:23:47,299
Thunderdome.

172
00:23:51,613 --> 00:23:56,141
Two men, hand to hand.
No jury, no appeal, no parole.

173
00:23:56,451 --> 00:23:58,419
Two men enter, one man leaves.

174
00:24:00,455 --> 00:24:01,683
Weapons?

175
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:05,155
Anything's possible. Chance decides.

176
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,456
Thunderdome. How do I get in there?

177
00:24:08,797 --> 00:24:11,163
That's easy. Pick a fight.

178
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,629
Everybody have a good time!

179
00:24:53,375 --> 00:24:56,776
That's my vehicle and I want it back!

180
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:59,778
Hearing wonky.
Sounds like an order.

181
00:25:00,782 --> 00:25:01,771
That's right.

182
00:25:02,384 --> 00:25:06,480
Yumping Yesus! Him sad.
Brain broken.

183
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:10,085
Me explain.

184
00:25:10,825 --> 00:25:13,623
This my vehicle. You...

185
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:15,786
...pedestrian!

186
00:25:20,402 --> 00:25:21,494
Three seconds...

187
00:25:21,836 --> 00:25:23,667
...break neck. One...

188
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:35,510
MasterBlaster!

189
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:38,210
Listen to the law!

190
00:25:38,553 --> 00:25:41,784
Aunty, two men in dispute.

191
00:25:45,326 --> 00:25:47,521
These our witness, Aunty.

192
00:25:47,862 --> 00:25:51,389
Us suffer bad. Us want justice.

193
00:25:51,866 --> 00:25:54,664
We want Thunderdome!

194
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:59,262
You know the law.
Two men enter one man leaves.

195
00:26:01,876 --> 00:26:06,836
This Blaster.
Twenty men enter, only him leave.

196
00:26:07,449 --> 00:26:10,384
Then it's your choice. Thunderdome.

197
00:26:43,751 --> 00:26:46,720
Aunty! Aunty!

198
00:26:50,325 --> 00:26:54,284
Welcome to another edition
of Thunderdome!

199
00:27:18,786 --> 00:27:21,186
Listen on! Listen on!

200
00:27:21,823 --> 00:27:23,586
This is the truth of it.

201
00:27:23,925 --> 00:27:28,191
Fighting leads to killing,
and killing gets to warring.

202
00:27:28,596 --> 00:27:31,622
And that was damn near
the death of us all.

203
00:27:32,534 --> 00:27:36,903
Look at us now, busted up
and everyone talking about hard rain.

204
00:27:37,539 --> 00:27:42,203
But we've learned by the dust
of them all. Bartertown's learned.

205
00:27:42,677 --> 00:27:45,908
Now when men get to fighting,
it happens here.

206
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:48,348
And it finishes here.

207
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:52,609
Two men enter, one man leaves.

208
00:28:17,145 --> 00:28:21,081
And right now, I've got two men.

209
00:28:21,549 --> 00:28:24,518
Two men with a gut full of fear.

210
00:28:25,553 --> 00:28:29,785
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls...

211
00:28:32,427 --> 00:28:34,657
...dying time's here!

212
00:28:36,431 --> 00:28:39,662
He's the ball cracker. Death on foot.

213
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:44,260
You know him. You love him!
He's Blaster!

214
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:58,812
The challenger,
direct from out of the Wasteland.

215
00:28:59,287 --> 00:29:02,256
He's bad. He's beautiful.
He's crazy!

216
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:06,122
It's the man with no name!

217
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:05,182
Thunderdome's simple. Get to the
weapons, use them anyway you can.

218
00:30:05,486 --> 00:30:08,887
I know you won't break the rules.
There aren't any.

219
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:15,688
Remember where you are.

220
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:18,331
This is Thunderdome.

221
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:23,499
Death is listening and will take
the first man that screams.

222
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,834
Prepare!

223
00:30:45,827 --> 00:30:48,421
Two men enter, one man leave!

224
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:54,167
You know the law!
-This is Thunderdome!

225
00:35:54,368 --> 00:35:55,335
Kill him!

226
00:35:55,536 --> 00:35:58,471
No, no! Look at his face!

227
00:35:59,707 --> 00:36:01,197
He's got the mind of a child.

228
00:36:05,379 --> 00:36:07,210
It's not his fault.

229
00:36:10,518 --> 00:36:12,486
Blaster, I'm sorry.

230
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:15,085
This wasn't part of the deal.

231
00:36:15,623 --> 00:36:16,487
Deal?!

232
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,887
What do you mean, "deal"?

233
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:26,091
You must have tasted it.
It was in your hands.

234
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:27,792
You had it all!

235
00:36:29,236 --> 00:36:30,635
What do you mean, "deal"?

236
00:36:35,242 --> 00:36:36,641
No more methane!

237
00:36:37,244 --> 00:36:39,769
This place... finished!

238
00:36:40,214 --> 00:36:41,442
No, little man.

239
00:36:41,749 --> 00:36:43,341
We've only just begun.

240
00:37:10,377 --> 00:37:11,366
Open it.

241
00:37:16,283 --> 00:37:18,376
Two men enter. One man leave!

242
00:37:54,221 --> 00:37:55,882
What's this?!

243
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:02,728
Do you think I don't know the law?
Wasn't it me who wrote it?

244
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:05,722
And this man has broken the law.

245
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,168
Right or wrong, we had a deal.

246
00:38:08,769 --> 00:38:12,170
And the law says,
"Bust a deal, face the wheel."

247
00:38:12,506 --> 00:38:14,701
Bust a deal and face the wheel.

248
00:38:30,457 --> 00:38:33,324
All our lives hang by a thread.

249
00:38:33,794 --> 00:38:36,319
Now we've got a man
waiting for sentence.

250
00:38:36,664 --> 00:38:39,895
But ain't it the truth?
You take your chances with the law.

251
00:38:40,534 --> 00:38:42,900
Justice is only a roll of the dice...

252
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:47,306
...a flip of the coin,
a turn of the wheel.

253
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:10,778
Fix It.

254
00:41:11,418 --> 00:41:13,648
You run Bartertown.

255
00:41:14,288 --> 00:41:15,778
You fix.

256
00:41:24,865 --> 00:41:27,265
Not pigs! No!

257
00:41:47,855 --> 00:41:49,379
That's enough!

258
00:41:51,458 --> 00:41:55,121
Do you want to use him or kill him?
Bring him up.

259
00:42:09,176 --> 00:42:12,407
Master, do what Ironbar says.

260
00:42:13,747 --> 00:42:16,545
I will. Yeah, I will.

261
00:47:51,885 --> 00:47:53,546
Savannah!

262
00:47:59,893 --> 00:48:01,724
Finn, look.

263
00:48:03,764 --> 00:48:06,460
It's him. I finded him.

264
00:48:08,201 --> 00:48:09,691
It's Captain Walker.

265
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:56,214
What's his talk?
-He ain't made wordstuff.

266
00:48:56,516 --> 00:48:58,882
It's a long track.
Maybe he's burned out.

267
00:48:59,386 --> 00:49:01,752
Maybe.
Maybe he's just listening.

268
00:49:04,257 --> 00:49:05,884
Walker? Hello?

269
00:49:07,828 --> 00:49:10,092
Maybe he's talking,
but we ain't hearing.

270
00:49:10,397 --> 00:49:12,092
You see his lips ain't moving.

271
00:49:12,399 --> 00:49:14,230
Not with wordstuff, with sonic.

272
00:49:14,501 --> 00:49:17,470
That ain't never gonna work,
sonic-bonny bullshit!

273
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:22,474
This is Delta-Fox-X-Ray.

274
00:49:22,809 --> 00:49:24,208
Can you hear me?

275
00:49:25,245 --> 00:49:26,644
Delta-Fox-X-Ray.

276
00:49:28,615 --> 00:49:29,877
Come In.

277
00:49:31,818 --> 00:49:33,513
Is anybody out there?

278
00:49:37,424 --> 00:49:38,652
Can you read me, Walker?

279
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:01,679
What's up, Doc?

280
00:50:03,717 --> 00:50:05,810
Hey, take me with you!

281
00:50:08,455 --> 00:50:10,116
Can you hear me, Walker?

282
00:51:08,748 --> 00:51:10,579
Fly, Walker!

283
00:51:51,124 --> 00:51:52,489
Who are you?

284
00:51:54,394 --> 00:51:55,759
Quiet!

285
00:51:58,264 --> 00:51:59,595
Shut up!

286
00:52:04,104 --> 00:52:06,072
Enough!

287
00:52:44,711 --> 00:52:46,235
Who are you?

288
00:52:48,381 --> 00:52:49,678
The waiting ones.

289
00:52:50,150 --> 00:52:51,242
Waiting for what?

290
00:52:51,518 --> 00:52:52,746
Waiting for you.

291
00:52:54,387 --> 00:52:55,376
And who am I?

292
00:52:59,859 --> 00:53:02,123
I think he be testing us.

293
00:53:03,863 --> 00:53:06,798
This a testing, Walker?
You reckon we been slack?

294
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:09,668
I don't know. Maybe you've been slack.

295
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:14,396
We ain't. We kept it straight.
It's all there.

296
00:53:14,707 --> 00:53:19,144
Everything marked, everything
'membered. You wait, you'll see.
