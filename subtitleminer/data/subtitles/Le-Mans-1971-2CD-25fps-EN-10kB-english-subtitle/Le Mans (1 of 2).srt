1
00:05:23,112 --> 00:05:25,478
Your attention, please.

2
00:05:25,514 --> 00:05:27,038
Your attention, please.

3
00:05:27,082 --> 00:05:32,384
There has been an accident
at Maison Blanche.

4
00:05:32,421 --> 00:05:38,724
It involved Porsche number 64,
driven by Michael Delaney

5
00:05:38,761 --> 00:05:43,789
and Ferrari number 18,
driven by Fioro Belgetti.

6
00:05:55,277 --> 00:05:56,767
Senora Belgetti,

7
00:05:58,847 --> 00:06:01,577
Attention, attention...

8
00:14:51,213 --> 00:14:54,614
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

9
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:58,711
On this circuit, the world's
most famous motor race is run.

10
00:14:58,754 --> 00:15:01,689
Conceived by Charles Faroux
and Georges Durand

11
00:15:01,724 --> 00:15:02,958
shortly after
the first World War,

12
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:04,949
shortly after
the first World War,

13
00:15:04,994 --> 00:15:06,859
the course was named after
the nearest town

14
00:15:06,896 --> 00:15:09,888
and the number of hours
that men and machines

15
00:15:09,932 --> 00:15:13,459
are put to the supreme test
of speed and stamina.

16
00:15:13,502 --> 00:15:20,135
The circuit is 13.469
kilometers, or 8.418 miles.

17
00:15:20,176 --> 00:15:24,636
Composed of country roads linked
with the main highway

18
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:29,117
nearly all of it open to traffic
363 days a year.

19
00:15:29,151 --> 00:15:32,848
Along the 3.2-mile
Mulsanne straight

20
00:15:32,888 --> 00:15:39,817
the cars reach a maximum speed
in excess of 230 miles per hour.

21
00:15:39,862 --> 00:15:43,320
The first race was run in 1923.

22
00:15:43,365 --> 00:15:46,994
The lap record was nine minutes,
39 seconds.

23
00:15:47,036 --> 00:15:52,167
The average speed,
66.69 miles per hour.

24
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:56,645
Last year, the lap record
was three minutes, 22 seconds.

25
00:15:56,679 --> 00:16:01,776
The average speed,
145.508 miles per hour.

26
00:16:01,817 --> 00:16:04,877
The race is open
to six classes of cars--

27
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:08,083
from the smallest
production models

28
00:16:08,123 --> 00:16:11,024
to the largest sports
and turbo-type engines--

29
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:14,791
all competing at the same time
on the same circuit.

30
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:20,632
There are 55 cars
and 1 10 drivers

31
00:16:20,669 --> 00:16:23,866
representing countries
from all over the world.

32
00:16:23,906 --> 00:16:28,138
They will drive day and night,
through sun and rain.

33
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:30,144
Beneath his racing suit,

34
00:16:30,246 --> 00:16:33,807
each driver must wear
fireproof underwear

35
00:16:33,849 --> 00:16:38,149
capable of withstanding
2,400 degrees Fahrenheit--

36
00:16:38,187 --> 00:16:42,647
the temperature of burning
gasoline-- for 15 seconds.

37
00:16:42,691 --> 00:16:45,489
His blood type must be indicated

38
00:16:45,528 --> 00:16:48,827
on either suit or crash helmet.

39
00:16:48,864 --> 00:16:53,164
Each car has two alternating
drivers.

40
00:16:53,235 --> 00:16:56,693
No driver may total more
than 14 out of the 24 hours.

41
00:16:59,108 --> 00:17:01,508
Each driver must have
at least one hour rest

42
00:17:01,544 --> 00:17:04,604
between turns at the wheel.

43
00:17:04,647 --> 00:17:08,913
No one may drive more
than four consecutive hours.

44
00:17:19,728 --> 00:17:22,629
For the first time
in the history of this race,

45
00:17:22,665 --> 00:17:24,963
the running start,

46
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,401
with the drivers lined up on
the opposite side of the track

47
00:17:28,437 --> 00:17:29,927
then running to their cars

48
00:17:29,972 --> 00:17:31,963
at the fall
of the tri-colored flag,

49
00:17:32,007 --> 00:17:34,475
tests speed of action
for reasons of safety.

50
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:36,978
This year, the drivers will be

51
00:17:37,012 --> 00:17:39,139
securely strapped
into their driving seats

52
00:17:39,181 --> 00:17:40,842
prior to the start of the race.

53
00:17:42,851 --> 00:17:46,309
Yellow flags and yellow lights
along the circuit

54
00:17:46,355 --> 00:17:49,153
indicate the presence
of an accident

55
00:17:49,191 --> 00:17:53,525
or as it is called
in the racing world, a "shunt".

56
00:17:54,296 --> 00:17:56,856
Yellow means danger.

57
00:17:56,899 --> 00:17:57,923
No overtaking.

58
00:17:57,967 --> 00:18:00,868
The race will start
4:00 p.m. Saturday,

59
00:18:00,903 --> 00:18:03,201
and finish 4:00 p.m Sunday.

60
00:18:03,238 --> 00:18:07,436
The car covering the greatest
distance in 24 hours

61
00:18:07,476 --> 00:18:09,535
shall be the winner.

62
00:18:09,578 --> 00:18:12,945
In the case
of the last two cars,

63
00:18:12,982 --> 00:18:18,443
this will be the supreme test
of 3,000 miles.

64
00:18:18,487 --> 00:18:21,354
And so, ladies and gentlemen,

65
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:24,791
welcome to the most famous
motorcar race in the world--

66
00:18:24,827 --> 00:18:26,988
the 38th running
of the grand prix

67
00:18:27,029 --> 00:18:29,725
of endurance
and efficiency--

68
00:18:29,765 --> 00:18:33,792
the 24 hours of Le Mans.

69
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:05,312
We're pleased to welcome
Michael Delaney back to Le Mans

70
00:22:05,347 --> 00:22:08,475
after his unfortunate accident
here last year

71
00:22:08,517 --> 00:22:10,985
and to see that he is
in such good form

72
00:22:11,019 --> 00:22:13,988
following his exciting race,
a fortnight ago

73
00:22:14,022 --> 00:22:15,751
at the Nurburgring

74
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:18,658
where Ferrari's top driver,
Erich Stahler,

75
00:22:18,694 --> 00:22:20,059
narrowly beat him.

76
00:22:20,095 --> 00:22:23,155
The Delaney-Stahler rivalry

77
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:26,895
will be interesting to follow
on this very different circuit

78
00:22:26,935 --> 00:22:28,869
where the endurance of the car

79
00:22:28,904 --> 00:22:32,362
is as important as is the skill
of the driver.

80
00:22:45,454 --> 00:22:48,184
It is now five minutes to four.

81
00:22:48,223 --> 00:22:50,350
Five minutes to start.

82
00:22:50,392 --> 00:22:52,690
Will all drivers be
in their cars

83
00:22:52,728 --> 00:22:55,458
in one minute's time, please.

84
00:23:12,681 --> 00:23:15,417
Drivers... to your cars, please.

85
00:23:15,417 --> 00:23:18,386
Drivers... to your cars, please.

86
00:23:28,097 --> 00:23:30,691
Four minutes to start.

87
00:24:04,466 --> 00:24:07,765
Three minutes to start.

88
00:24:31,193 --> 00:24:34,492
Two-and-a-half minutes to start.

89
00:24:46,275 --> 00:24:48,800
Two minutes to start.

90
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:58,015
And once again, here are the
first ten qualifying positions:

91
00:24:58,053 --> 00:25:02,456
Number 25,
driven by Kurt Ahrens;

92
00:25:02,491 --> 00:25:06,894
number 15,
driven by Michael Parkes;

93
00:25:06,929 --> 00:25:12,333
number 21,
driven by Johann Ritter...

94
00:25:15,437 --> 00:25:20,807
...number 22,
driven by Paul-Jacques Dion;

95
00:25:20,843 --> 00:25:27,043
number eight,
driven by Erich Stahler...

96
00:25:28,984 --> 00:25:33,284
...number five,
driven by Lugo Abratte;

97
00:25:33,322 --> 00:25:39,420
number six,
driven by Vito Scaliso;

98
00:25:39,461 --> 00:25:45,491
number seven,
driven by Claude Aurac;

99
00:25:45,534 --> 00:25:50,494
number 20,
driven by Michael Delaney...

100
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:56,534
...number 14,
driven by Gilles Marnier.

101
00:31:30,779 --> 00:31:33,407
Over three minutes have passed.

102
00:31:33,449 --> 00:31:36,577
We may expect the cars through
the check gate any moment now.

103
00:31:36,618 --> 00:31:38,813
Will it be Porsche or Ferrari
in the lead?

104
00:35:55,978 --> 00:35:58,173
Here's the leading car,
Porsche number 25,

105
00:35:58,246 --> 00:36:00,043
in for its first pit stop
for fuel

106
00:36:00,082 --> 00:36:02,016
and possible driver change.

107
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:27,699
And here comes Erich Stahler,
Ferrari number eight,

108
00:36:27,743 --> 00:36:31,110
closely followed by the first
of the Gulf-Porsche cars,

109
00:36:31,146 --> 00:36:33,410
number 20,
driven by Michael Delaney.

110
00:36:35,751 --> 00:36:37,810
Watch out
for the red Lola.

111
00:36:41,123 --> 00:36:42,750
Okay.

112
00:37:18,794 --> 00:37:21,126
Pretty quick pit stop
for the Ferrari...

113
00:37:26,001 --> 00:37:29,835
...and here comes 20,
back on the track.

114
00:37:29,871 --> 00:37:32,669
Still in first place.

115
00:37:32,707 --> 00:37:37,508
Gulf-Porsche number 21,
driven by Johann Ritter,

116
00:37:37,546 --> 00:37:40,879
entering the pit.

117
00:37:48,623 --> 00:37:50,887
And... Porsche
number 20 Delaney.

118
00:37:50,926 --> 00:37:51,893
20 by four.

119
00:37:51,927 --> 00:37:53,758
Okay, thank you.

120
00:37:53,795 --> 00:37:57,390
My colleague has just handed me
a weather report,

121
00:37:57,432 --> 00:38:00,629
and it looks as if
the possibility of rain--

122
00:38:00,669 --> 00:38:04,867
which was previously forecast--
will shortly be upon us.

123
00:38:18,353 --> 00:38:21,811
Just one more, Mr. Delaney.

124
00:38:30,565 --> 00:38:31,657
Hello.

125
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:32,826
Hello.

126
00:38:32,868 --> 00:38:36,463
You had a very good start.

127
00:38:36,505 --> 00:38:39,133
It's a long race.

128
00:38:39,207 --> 00:38:40,231
Are you well?

129
00:38:50,752 --> 00:38:53,016
Excuse me.

130
00:40:10,631 --> 00:40:12,599
Thank you.

131
00:40:19,373 --> 00:40:21,466
What will you tell
Peter and Erica

132
00:40:21,509 --> 00:40:22,999
when they get old enough

133
00:40:23,044 --> 00:40:25,774
to ask what their father
does for a living?

134
00:40:25,813 --> 00:40:27,678
I'll tell them
that their father

135
00:40:27,715 --> 00:40:30,013
is the greatest
chauffeur in the world.

136
00:40:30,051 --> 00:40:33,509
If you had a choice,

137
00:40:33,554 --> 00:40:35,613
would you like to tell them
something else?

138
00:40:35,656 --> 00:40:38,921
For example,

139
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:42,657
"Well, this week, daddy's
flying to Switzerland."

140
00:40:45,132 --> 00:40:48,795
Yes. The new motor factory
is almost completed

141
00:40:48,836 --> 00:40:50,701
and I have to interview

142
00:40:50,738 --> 00:40:51,932
various applicants for...

143
00:40:51,973 --> 00:40:53,531
What are you trying
to tell me?

144
00:40:53,574 --> 00:40:58,034
Would you like that better?

145
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:02,015
Only if you'd like it better.

146
00:41:04,385 --> 00:41:06,819
If they ask me what their mother
does for a living,

147
00:41:06,854 --> 00:41:07,878
I'll say "she lies."

148
00:41:10,992 --> 00:41:12,892
"She can look straight
into your eyes

149
00:41:12,927 --> 00:41:14,292
"and tell the biggest lies

150
00:41:14,328 --> 00:41:16,319
you've ever heard
in your life."

151
00:41:16,364 --> 00:41:17,797
Really?

152
00:41:17,832 --> 00:41:19,424
Yes.

153
00:41:20,368 --> 00:41:23,337
It's the right time to stop.

154
00:41:23,371 --> 00:41:27,171
I can finish quite well
in this race.

155
00:41:27,208 --> 00:41:28,835
Perhaps even...

156
00:41:31,445 --> 00:41:36,144
Well, in any case,
it's the right time to stop.

157
00:41:47,628 --> 00:41:50,791
As was forecast,
we have our first touch of rain.

158
00:41:50,831 --> 00:41:53,026
It's going to be
very interesting

159
00:41:53,067 --> 00:41:56,400
to see what tactics
the team manages in the rain.

160
00:41:56,437 --> 00:41:57,904
If it's only a shower,

161
00:41:57,938 --> 00:42:00,930
they won't change
from dry to rain tires.

162
00:42:00,975 --> 00:42:03,910
But if it does continue,
they must.

163
00:43:04,438 --> 00:43:06,998
Your attention to the pit area.

164
00:43:07,041 --> 00:43:10,841
The longtail Porsche,
number 25, is coming in,

165
00:43:10,878 --> 00:43:12,709
after having been
out on the circuit

166
00:43:12,746 --> 00:43:14,771
for only 14 minutes,
since its last stop

167
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:17,045
for fuel and driver change.

168
00:43:17,084 --> 00:43:18,949
The team of Kurt Ahrens
and Vic Elford

169
00:43:18,986 --> 00:43:20,715
has built up
a formidable early lead

170
00:43:20,754 --> 00:43:22,722
on the factory Ferraris

171
00:43:22,756 --> 00:43:24,121
and the Gulf-Porsche team.

172
00:43:24,158 --> 00:43:25,386
However, it appears now

173
00:43:25,426 --> 00:43:27,792
that something definitely
out of the ordinary

174
00:43:27,828 --> 00:43:29,557
has befallen the Austrian entry.

175
00:43:29,597 --> 00:43:32,430
You will recall that
this is the car which,

176
00:43:32,466 --> 00:43:36,163
for the first time
in the history of Le Mans,

177
00:43:36,270 --> 00:43:39,762
averaged a speed in excess
of 150 miles per hour.

178
00:43:51,619 --> 00:43:52,813
Mr. Delaney.

179
00:43:52,853 --> 00:43:55,185
You know the white longtail
is out of the race

180
00:43:55,256 --> 00:43:56,450
with a blown engine.

181
00:43:56,490 --> 00:43:58,014
Yeah, well, that's bad luck.

182
00:43:58,058 --> 00:43:59,286
Do you think
it will be

183
00:43:59,326 --> 00:44:00,953
another
Ferrari-Porsche race?

184
00:44:00,995 --> 00:44:03,361
A little early to say,
but I think so.

185
00:44:03,397 --> 00:44:05,729
What kind of race
will you drive?

186
00:44:05,766 --> 00:44:08,826
Try to save the machine,
go as fast as I can, try to win.

187
00:44:08,869 --> 00:44:11,599
Do you think it will be
like Nurburgring--

188
00:44:11,639 --> 00:44:13,300
a race between
you and Stahler?

189
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:14,329
I hope not, ma'am.

190
00:44:14,375 --> 00:44:16,104
And what do you
think of Stahler?

191
00:44:16,143 --> 00:44:17,474
Stahler?
I think he's probably

192
00:44:17,511 --> 00:44:19,138
one of the best drivers
in the world.

193
00:44:19,213 --> 00:44:20,703
Excuse me.

194
00:44:21,815 --> 00:44:23,715
What do you think
is the most difficult thing

195
00:44:23,751 --> 00:44:24,718
about Le Mans?

196
00:44:24,752 --> 00:44:26,310
To go as fast as possible,

197
00:44:26,353 --> 00:44:28,685
and keep the car on the road
for 24 hours.

198
00:44:28,722 --> 00:44:30,246
That's difficult.

199
00:44:35,429 --> 00:44:36,987
Would this be
the same kind of race

200
00:44:37,031 --> 00:44:38,828
you had with Delaney
at the Nurburgring?

201
00:44:38,866 --> 00:44:39,855
Well, this is Le Mans.

202
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:41,367
It's a different thing,
you know?

203
00:44:41,402 --> 00:44:42,892
Do you think
that you and Delaney

204
00:44:42,937 --> 00:44:44,598
will end up having
a close race here?

205
00:44:44,638 --> 00:44:48,165
Maybe. He's fast, I'm fast,
so we're always together.

206
00:44:48,275 --> 00:44:49,264
Good luck.

207
00:44:56,016 --> 00:44:57,108
Michael...

208
00:45:04,825 --> 00:45:06,315
How's that German
car running?

209
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:08,954
Fast. Ferrari?

210
00:45:08,996 --> 00:45:10,327
Fast.

211
00:45:10,364 --> 00:45:11,854
It's getting wetter.

212
00:45:11,899 --> 00:45:13,059
Slipping and sliding.

213
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:15,000
Michael, uh...
the press is making

214
00:45:15,035 --> 00:45:17,026
a big thing about us.

215
00:45:18,639 --> 00:45:22,097
Yeah. But it's money.

216
00:45:23,310 --> 00:45:24,971
That's American.

217
00:45:26,614 --> 00:45:30,311
Michael...

218
00:45:30,351 --> 00:45:32,251
be careful.

219
00:45:33,954 --> 00:45:36,514
Now don't be a pain
in the ass, Erich.

220
00:45:48,402 --> 00:45:50,870
And here are
the official positions,

221
00:45:50,904 --> 00:45:52,735
two hours into the race.

222
00:45:52,773 --> 00:45:54,866
In first place,
Ferrari number eight

223
00:45:54,908 --> 00:45:57,433
finished 35 laps
at an average speed

224
00:45:57,478 --> 00:46:01,107
of 144.981 miles per hour.

225
00:46:01,148 --> 00:46:04,117
In second position
is Gulf-Porsche number 20

226
00:46:04,184 --> 00:46:05,811
at 35 laps...

227
00:47:21,829 --> 00:47:23,592
All cars have come into the pits

228
00:47:23,631 --> 00:47:26,429
to change to rain tires,
with the notable exception

229
00:47:26,467 --> 00:47:28,230
of the three
Gulf-Porsche entries

230
00:47:28,269 --> 00:47:29,998
and the four Ferrari team cars.

231
00:47:30,037 --> 00:47:35,031
It is apparent that neither
Porsche manager David Townsend

232
00:47:35,075 --> 00:47:37,134
or Ferrari manager
Loretto Fuselli

233
00:47:37,244 --> 00:47:40,338
wants to call his cars in
for an unscheduled pit stop

234
00:47:40,381 --> 00:47:42,440
during this closely
contested race.

235
00:47:42,483 --> 00:47:44,576
Looks kind of hairy
out there.

236
00:47:48,455 --> 00:47:49,683
At practice
it didn't rain,

237
00:47:49,723 --> 00:47:51,315
so this is really
your first time

238
00:47:51,358 --> 00:47:52,825
out in the weather
at Le Mans.

239
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:54,623
Ja, it is.

240
00:47:58,065 --> 00:48:01,933
Why doesn't Townsend
bring them in for rain tires?

241
00:48:01,969 --> 00:48:04,028
Why don't you ask him?

242
00:48:14,548 --> 00:48:16,641
It's raining worse
at Mulsanne.

243
00:48:16,684 --> 00:48:17,946
They're due in,
in 1 1 --

244
00:48:17,985 --> 00:48:19,782
In 1 1 minutes. I know.

245
00:49:44,371 --> 00:49:47,135
Your attention, please.

246
00:49:47,174 --> 00:49:49,005
Your attention, please.

247
00:49:49,043 --> 00:49:51,273
There has been an accident...

248
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:56,941
It involves Lola number 1 1,
and Porsche

249
00:49:56,984 --> 00:49:59,976
number 47.

250
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:02,250
Fortunately,
the drivers are not hurt.

251
00:50:02,289 --> 00:50:04,723
Bring them in
for rain tires.

252
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:34,874
Here we are.

253
00:51:34,915 --> 00:51:36,405
Ferrari's decided
to change at last.

254
00:51:42,156 --> 00:51:45,284
And Porsche number 20
has come into the pits, also.

255
00:51:45,325 --> 00:51:48,192
Now we should see a race develop
between the mechanics,

256
00:51:48,228 --> 00:51:49,456
and they will determine

257
00:51:49,496 --> 00:51:52,659
who's going
to be the first to go out.

258
00:52:41,615 --> 00:52:44,345
20 is away first.

259
00:52:44,384 --> 00:52:46,614
Delaney now leads Le Mans.

260
00:52:49,323 --> 00:52:51,348
And there goes Stahler,

261
00:52:51,391 --> 00:52:53,222
now in second place.

262
00:53:08,542 --> 00:53:10,032
-No problem.
-No problem, yes, yes.

263
00:53:10,077 --> 00:53:11,066
It's nothing!

264
00:53:43,243 --> 00:53:45,541
It's going well, Claude,
isn't it?

265
00:53:45,579 --> 00:53:47,069
Oui. I can feel it.

266
00:53:47,114 --> 00:53:48,604
The machine is good.

267
00:53:48,649 --> 00:53:50,412
This might be the year.

268
00:53:50,450 --> 00:53:52,179
Well, let's hope so.

269
00:53:52,252 --> 00:53:53,776
It's a long race.

270
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:54,912
I know.

271
00:53:54,955 --> 00:53:56,946
Don't think
too far ahead.

272
00:53:56,990 --> 00:53:58,116
Lisa?

273
00:53:58,158 --> 00:53:59,182
Yes?

274
00:53:59,259 --> 00:54:00,783
Would you like
some coffee?

275
00:54:02,596 --> 00:54:04,655
No, thank you.

276
00:54:07,668 --> 00:54:09,533
Ciao.

277
00:57:20,827 --> 00:57:22,954
What problems
have you got out there?

278
00:57:22,996 --> 00:57:25,396
Only thing is,
that off the Mulsanne,

279
00:57:25,431 --> 00:57:27,422
in the middle of the road...

280
00:57:29,402 --> 00:57:31,370
...if you stay
a little bit to the right

281
00:57:31,404 --> 00:57:33,565
and watch it when you come up
over the hump,

282
00:57:33,606 --> 00:57:35,836
has a little bit of tendency
to go this way.

283
00:57:46,419 --> 00:57:49,411
Be a little careful
before you go into the cape,

284
00:57:49,455 --> 00:57:51,616
and you can out-brake
the Ferrari.

285
00:57:59,432 --> 00:58:01,900
Hey, guys, move it!
