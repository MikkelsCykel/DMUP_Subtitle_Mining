Oh, God.

26
00:03:18,891 --> 00:03:20,267
Easy, easy,
easy, easy.

27
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:22,894
Cramp! Cramp!
Cramp! Cramp!

28
00:03:26,481 --> 00:03:28,733
Fu-- Fucking top five.

29
00:03:28,733 --> 00:03:31,486
That was fucking...
top five.

30
00:03:37,825 --> 00:03:39,868
So what are you saying?

31
00:03:44,623 --> 00:03:48,543
Are you saying women
have it easier than men?

32
00:03:48,543 --> 00:03:52,129
Look, all I'm saying
is that you guys...

33
00:03:52,129 --> 00:03:54,382
women have one
certain luxury

34
00:03:54,382 --> 00:03:56,300
that us men
just do not have.

35
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,509
Oh, yeah?

36
00:03:57,509 --> 00:04:01,221
And what is this one luxury,
might I ask, baby?

37
00:04:02,889 --> 00:04:04,891
Let me get my breath,
and I'm gonna tell you.

38
00:04:04,891 --> 00:04:06,476
I'm gonna spell it
out for ya.

39
00:04:06,476 --> 00:04:08,394
How do I know it's gonna
be pure genius?

40
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,367
Fine.

41
00:04:26,536 --> 00:04:28,997
No matter how I say this, I'm
gonna be the fucking asshole,

42
00:04:29,038 --> 00:04:30,498
so I'm just gonna come out
and say it, all right?

43
00:04:30,498 --> 00:04:32,250
Sweet!

44
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,668
This whole
equality thing...

45
00:04:34,668 --> 00:04:36,086
is crap.

46
00:04:36,086 --> 00:04:37,338
God, you've got
a gift for delivery.

47
00:04:37,338 --> 00:04:39,047
It's bullshit.
Look, just hear me out.

48
00:04:39,047 --> 00:04:41,633
All I'm saying is that
you and I are not equal.

49
00:04:41,633 --> 00:04:44,719
Sure, we all slave away
at our dead-end

50
00:04:44,719 --> 00:04:46,805
stupid-ass jobs
just like each other.

51
00:04:46,805 --> 00:04:48,681
But there's a difference:

52
00:04:48,681 --> 00:04:50,349
the luxury.

53
00:04:50,349 --> 00:04:53,060
The one luxury
that we do not have.

54
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,688
And?

55
00:04:55,688 --> 00:04:58,524
It is not okay for us
to be dependent

56
00:04:58,524 --> 00:04:59,483
on someone else.

57
00:04:59,483 --> 00:05:01,693
What?
Exactly that.

58
00:05:01,693 --> 00:05:02,778
You can work
your ass off.

59
00:05:02,778 --> 00:05:04,237
You can go to college,
get a degree,

60
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:06,656
and get a job
just like me.

61
00:05:06,656 --> 00:05:09,117
But what I can't do
is say "Fuck it"

62
00:05:09,117 --> 00:05:10,993
and choose to depend
on someone else.

63
00:05:10,993 --> 00:05:12,620
Only women
have that right.

64
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,914
If I do it, I'm a bum
or a gigolo.

65
00:05:14,914 --> 00:05:16,332
If you do it,
you're a housewife.

66
00:05:16,332 --> 00:05:19,626
Or even better yet,
a domestic engineer.

67
00:05:19,626 --> 00:05:22,504
Give me
a fucking break!

68
00:05:22,504 --> 00:05:25,173
You're right.
I know.

69
00:05:25,173 --> 00:05:28,426
You're the fucking
asshole.

70
00:05:28,426 --> 00:05:31,053
Come on.

71
00:05:31,053 --> 00:05:32,680
Where are you going?

72
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,558
To flush down
your demon seeds.

73
00:05:35,558 --> 00:05:39,645
You know, it's incredible
to me how someone

74
00:05:39,645 --> 00:05:42,689
who appears to be so smart
can be so fucking dumb!

75
00:05:42,689 --> 00:05:43,857
Yeah, well, you're
just pissed off

76
00:05:43,857 --> 00:05:45,608
that you know
that shit's all true.

77
00:05:45,608 --> 00:05:47,026
Fucking hamstring.

78
00:05:47,026 --> 00:05:49,195
Whatever.

79
00:05:49,195 --> 00:05:50,321
Tell me that it's not.

80
00:05:50,321 --> 00:05:51,572
Whatever!
Yeah. You know.

81
00:05:51,572 --> 00:05:53,324
Kiss my ass.

82
00:05:53,324 --> 00:05:56,577
Why is it we always get
into these heated discussions

83
00:05:56,577 --> 00:05:57,786
right when we're done
having sex?

84
00:05:59,121 --> 00:06:01,415
Maybe because
I'm left unsatisfied

85
00:06:01,415 --> 00:06:04,876
and need to take my
frustrations out somewhere?

86
00:06:04,876 --> 00:06:07,462
That's not what you were
screaming a couple of minutes ago.

87
00:06:07,462 --> 00:06:09,630
Yeah? What was
I screaming, big guy?

88
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:12,300
"Oh, Chris, stop.
Chris, stop.

89
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,635
Oh, stop! Chris, please
don't stop." Shut up!

90
00:06:14,635 --> 00:06:16,303
Ow! You just
hit me in the balls.

91
00:06:16,303 --> 00:06:17,429
Good.
You deserve it.

92
00:06:27,605 --> 00:06:28,940
Sit down.

93
00:06:35,654 --> 00:06:38,407
So...
So...

94
00:06:38,407 --> 00:06:40,158
When do you think you're just
gonna come out and say it?

95
00:06:40,158 --> 00:06:42,119
Say what?

96
00:06:42,119 --> 00:06:44,454
How deeply in love
with me you are.

97
00:06:44,454 --> 00:06:46,706
In your dreams.

98
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:50,585
Baby, it's all right.
I know.

99
00:06:50,585 --> 00:06:53,462
Christopher, could you
be more full of yourself?

100
00:06:53,462 --> 00:06:55,214
I could.

101
00:06:55,214 --> 00:06:57,383
I just choose to keep
my arrogance toned down

102
00:06:57,383 --> 00:06:59,718
around women I'm giving
the hot beef injection to.

103
00:06:59,718 --> 00:07:02,262
What are you,
in third grade?

104
00:07:02,262 --> 00:07:03,889
What, you don't like
"hot beef injection"?

105
00:07:03,889 --> 00:07:05,890
How about my one-eyed snake?
My Dodger dog?

106
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:07,392
My giggle stick?

107
00:07:07,392 --> 00:07:09,727
You're impossible.

108
00:07:09,727 --> 00:07:11,687
I'm cheap and I'm easy.
Tell all your friends.

109
00:07:11,687 --> 00:07:13,731
Do you ever stop?

110
00:07:13,731 --> 00:07:16,650
I'll stop when you admit
your everlasting love for me.

111
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:19,486
Well, then you better get
comfortable, Mr. Giggle Stick.

112
00:07:19,486 --> 00:07:21,321
Oh, I'm good.

113
00:07:21,321 --> 00:07:24,241
Okay.

114
00:07:24,241 --> 00:07:25,200
Good.

115
00:07:27,327 --> 00:07:30,496
Seriously, Leslie.

116
00:07:30,496 --> 00:07:33,457
I know that...

117
00:07:33,457 --> 00:07:36,252
you have
feelings for me.

118
00:07:36,252 --> 00:07:38,128
Where is this
coming from?

119
00:07:38,128 --> 00:07:39,922
I mean, I thought we were
just having fun here.

120
00:07:39,922 --> 00:07:41,965
Isn't that what you say?
We're friends who fuck.

121
00:07:41,965 --> 00:07:43,300
I'm being serious here.

122
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,760
Like, why is that
so hard for you to admit?

123
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,428
'Cause we're friends,
Christopher.

124
00:07:47,428 --> 00:07:49,931
That's all we ever are,
that's all we'll ever be:

125
00:07:49,931 --> 00:07:53,142
friends.

126
00:07:53,142 --> 00:07:55,186
I mean, look at us.
It would never work.

127
00:07:55,186 --> 00:07:57,187
You're way
too fast for me,

128
00:07:57,187 --> 00:08:02,067
and I'm way too
demanding for you, and...

129
00:08:02,067 --> 00:08:03,985
And I like the way
things are.

130
00:08:06,029 --> 00:08:07,572
Don't you?

131
00:08:07,572 --> 00:08:09,574
I just thought...

132
00:08:11,701 --> 00:08:13,786
Never mind.

133
00:08:13,786 --> 00:08:16,413
What? No, never mind. You're right.

134
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:23,086
You couldn't
handle me anyway.

135
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:25,463
Excuse me?

136
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:28,299
I believe I just handled you
three times, if I'm not mistaken.

137
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:30,259
Is that what you call handling?
Yeah.

138
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:32,345
'Cause I was taking it
easy on you.

139
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:35,389
I send broads
to the chiropractor.

140
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:37,725
God, if only your dick
was as big as your ego.

141
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:40,018
If it was, I wouldn't
be able to walk around.

142
00:08:40,018 --> 00:08:42,687
And neither would you,
for that matter.

143
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:50,319
Anyway, I don't
hear you complaining.

144
00:08:50,319 --> 00:08:53,406
That's because you never shut up
long enough for me to get a word in.

145
00:08:53,406 --> 00:08:55,324
You love my dick
as much as you love me.

146
00:08:55,324 --> 00:08:57,451
Oh, shut up!

147
00:08:57,451 --> 00:08:58,869
You know what I think?

148
00:08:58,869 --> 00:09:00,204
Uh-uh, but I'm pretty sure
you're gonna tell me.

149
00:09:00,204 --> 00:09:02,205
I think that you're the one
who's in love with me

150
00:09:02,205 --> 00:09:03,748
and you're just projecting.

151
00:09:03,748 --> 00:09:05,417
Yeah, that's it!
No, I'm ser--

152
00:09:05,417 --> 00:09:07,669
You're trying to get me
to admit to loving you

153
00:09:07,669 --> 00:09:09,462
because you're too much
of an insecure pussy

154
00:09:09,462 --> 00:09:10,463
to just come out
and admit it.

155
00:09:12,298 --> 00:09:14,258
Well, you've obviously put
a lot of thought to this.

156
00:09:14,258 --> 00:09:16,885
Actually, no. It was just this
brilliant realization that came to me.

157
00:09:16,885 --> 00:09:19,513
Are you saying that...

158
00:09:19,555 --> 00:09:21,390
given the extreme
unlikelihood

159
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:23,517
that I actually did
have feelings for you,

160
00:09:23,558 --> 00:09:25,560
that if I were
to make those known,

161
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,645
that you would then
step to the plate

162
00:09:27,645 --> 00:09:29,272
and acknowledge your
undying love for me?

163
00:09:29,272 --> 00:09:31,149
I'm not letting you
off the hook like that.

164
00:09:31,149 --> 00:09:33,234
Like what? It doesn't work
like that, Christopher.

165
00:09:33,234 --> 00:09:34,944
Love is not negotiable.

166
00:09:34,944 --> 00:09:37,905
Oh, baby,
everything's negotiable.

167
00:09:37,905 --> 00:09:39,907
No, not love.

168
00:09:39,907 --> 00:09:44,119
Not love. Love is...
a guessing game.

169
00:09:44,119 --> 00:09:46,287
And that's the beauty of it.
There's no guarantees.

170
00:09:46,287 --> 00:09:48,957
It's like...diving
into a pool of water

171
00:09:48,957 --> 00:09:51,459
without knowing
if it's shallow or deep.

172
00:09:51,459 --> 00:09:52,752
And sure, yeah,
if it's shallow,

173
00:09:52,752 --> 00:09:56,297
you end up hurt and
paralyzed from the neck down.

174
00:09:58,465 --> 00:10:00,425
But if it's deep...

175
00:10:02,761 --> 00:10:03,803
you know...

176
00:10:07,474 --> 00:10:09,100
It's a leap of faith.

177
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,853
It's like throwing yourself out
there without any guarantees, dude,

178
00:10:11,853 --> 00:10:13,396
and that's what
life's about.

179
00:10:15,898 --> 00:10:18,650
Okay, you know
those carnival games, right?

180
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:20,944
And you know how some of them
are really hard to win

181
00:10:20,944 --> 00:10:23,113
and some of them are super easy
and everyone wins?

182
00:10:23,113 --> 00:10:24,656
Sure.

183
00:10:24,656 --> 00:10:25,782
Well, it's just that
that's the difference

184
00:10:25,782 --> 00:10:27,283
between love and sex.

185
00:10:28,868 --> 00:10:31,204
Sex is the game
where everyone

186
00:10:31,204 --> 00:10:34,749
wins a little prize,
and no one goes home a loser.

187
00:10:34,749 --> 00:10:39,461
And...love is the game
that's really hard to win.

188
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:47,343
But if you do,
and you get to take home

189
00:10:47,343 --> 00:10:52,306
that life-sized
stuffed rhinoceros,

190
00:10:52,306 --> 00:10:54,892
it feels a whole lot better
than taking home

191
00:10:54,892 --> 00:10:57,019
that shitty little
plastic key chain.

192
00:11:12,658 --> 00:11:14,201
Hey.

193
00:11:14,201 --> 00:11:16,537
Yeah?

194
00:11:19,748 --> 00:11:23,001
You've got a fucked-up way
of explaining shit.

195
00:11:23,001 --> 00:11:24,919
I mean...fuck!

196
00:11:34,345 --> 00:11:35,846
Good night, Christopher.

197
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,813
Good night.

198
00:11:49,025 --> 00:11:52,403
<i># She's a little bit cold,
she's a little bit bold #</i>

199
00:11:52,403 --> 00:11:53,946
<i># She's a little bit funny #</i>

200
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:56,865

00:11:56,865 --> 00:12:01,119

life's taken its toll #</i>

203
00:12:04,164 --> 00:12:06,291

204
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:10,795

205
00:12:12,797 --> 00:12:15,591

00:12:15,591 --> 00:12:18,969

00:12:32,648 --> 00:12:35,860
<i># Surrender to me #</i>

213
00:12:40,197 --> 00:12:41,990
I love you.

214
00:12:45,952 --> 00:12:47,453
I love you, too.

215
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:14,854
I'm not gay now,
am I?

216
00:13:14,854 --> 00:13:18,107
I don't know.
Did you like it?

217
00:13:18,107 --> 00:13:20,776
No.
Then no, you're not gay.

218
00:13:20,776 --> 00:13:23,445
But at least
now you're sure.

219
00:13:23,445 --> 00:13:24,946
Yeah.

220
00:13:24,946 --> 00:13:28,491
You sore?

221
00:13:28,491 --> 00:13:30,451
A little.
It gets better.

222
00:13:30,451 --> 00:13:31,619
Yeah?
Yeah.

223
00:13:35,873 --> 00:13:37,666
I don't care.

224
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:39,334
Whatever.

225
00:13:40,669 --> 00:13:43,255
You know, you don't have
to feel bad about this.

226
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:44,965
About what?
About us having fun.

227
00:13:44,965 --> 00:13:46,174
There's nothing
wrong with it.

228
00:13:46,174 --> 00:13:48,176
Yeah, I know. I'm just--
I'm not gay, so--

229
00:13:48,176 --> 00:13:51,304
I just saying you don't
have to feel bad about it.

230
00:13:51,304 --> 00:13:53,180
Everyone fools around
at least once,

231
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,015
whether they
admit it or not.

232
00:13:55,015 --> 00:13:56,767
I can't tell you
how many straight boys

233
00:13:56,767 --> 00:13:58,310
I've had this same
conversation with.

234
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:00,312
What conversation
is that?

235
00:14:04,316 --> 00:14:07,694
The "talk you down from
the ledge" conversation.

236
00:14:09,737 --> 00:14:11,447
What ledge, man?
What are you  talking about?

237
00:14:11,447 --> 00:14:14,784
You frat boys,
you're all the same!

238
00:14:14,784 --> 00:14:17,328
You're all caught up in
this bullshit machismo world

239
00:14:17,328 --> 00:14:19,830
that is forced upon you,

240
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:21,498
so you're afraid to have
a sensitive side.

241
00:14:21,498 --> 00:14:23,416
Bullshit.

242
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:24,834
Bullshit my ass.
Right now, you're a jumper.

243
00:14:24,834 --> 00:14:26,753
I so wish I knew
what the fuck

244
00:14:26,753 --> 00:14:28,129
you were talking
about right now.

245
00:14:28,129 --> 00:14:29,964
You're on the ledge
ready to jump

246
00:14:29,964 --> 00:14:30,882
'cause you can't
deal with the fact

247
00:14:30,882 --> 00:14:32,133
that you liked
having sex with a man.

248
00:14:34,635 --> 00:14:37,596
It's true.

249
00:14:37,596 --> 00:14:40,724
And then I come in and I give you this
whole shtick about how you're not gay

250
00:14:40,724 --> 00:14:42,893
and everyone does it
at least once.

251
00:14:42,893 --> 00:14:45,645
And then eventually, you
come back down off that ledge.

252
00:14:45,645 --> 00:14:49,482
But now you're still left with
a hint of regret and guilt,

253
00:14:49,482 --> 00:14:51,359
and you push it
deep down inside,

254
00:14:51,359 --> 00:14:54,153
and it's locked away,
never to be mentioned again.

255
00:14:54,153 --> 00:14:57,489
Just a distant memory that you'll
come to deny ever even happened.

256
00:14:57,489 --> 00:15:00,367
It's a college campus cliché.

257
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:02,494
The homophobic frat boy
that loves it in the ass,

258
00:15:02,494 --> 00:15:04,913
but doesn't want anybody
to know about it.

259
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:08,666
It's sad, really.

260
00:15:11,961 --> 00:15:14,046
Not me.
Whatever.

261
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:15,214
Whatever.

262
00:15:17,966 --> 00:15:19,134
I'm not homophobic.

263
00:15:19,134 --> 00:15:21,386
You're kidding me!
I'm not homophobic.

264
00:15:21,386 --> 00:15:22,763
Then why keep it
a secret?

265
00:15:22,763 --> 00:15:24,639
Because it's nobody's
fucking business.

266
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,057
You think I can't
read you?

267
00:15:26,057 --> 00:15:28,476
You're the definition
of homophobic.

268
00:15:28,476 --> 00:15:30,728
The mere thought of the
possibility of you being gay

269
00:15:30,728 --> 00:15:32,104
scares you
beyond belief.

270
00:15:32,104 --> 00:15:33,481
You're barking up
the wrong tree.

271
00:15:33,481 --> 00:15:35,149
Whatever helps you
sleep at night.

272
00:15:35,149 --> 00:15:36,317
What the fuck's
your problem?

273
00:15:36,317 --> 00:15:37,735
I'm not the one
with the problem, boy!

274
00:15:37,735 --> 00:15:39,903
Don't call me "boy,"
you fucking faggot!

275
00:15:43,782 --> 00:15:46,159
Well, there it is.

276
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:47,785
I was waiting for it.
What?

277
00:15:47,785 --> 00:15:49,454
You just proved
my entire point.

278
00:15:49,454 --> 00:15:52,290
'Cause I called you a faggot?
Bingo.

279
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:54,125
What the fuck does that mean, "bingo?"
You know what?

280
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:55,668
I'm really tired,
and I'm sick of having

281
00:15:55,668 --> 00:15:57,086
to explain
everything to you.

282
00:15:57,086 --> 00:15:59,296
So if you don't mind,
I'd rather you just leave.

283
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,216
Why did you do it?

284
00:16:06,428 --> 00:16:08,471
What do you care?

285
00:16:11,849 --> 00:16:13,768
I want to know.

286
00:16:17,438 --> 00:16:20,774
You really want
to know why?

287
00:16:20,774 --> 00:16:22,401
Yeah.

288
00:16:29,073 --> 00:16:30,533
Power.

289
00:16:31,576 --> 00:16:33,119
Power?

290
00:16:33,119 --> 00:16:35,538
Yeah.

291
00:16:35,538 --> 00:16:37,539
Power.

292
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:40,667
Elaborate.

293
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:44,504
My whole life, starting
from grade school

294
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:45,880
up until the point
I came out of the closet,

295
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,217
I was beaten up,

296
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:50,843
ridiculed,
made fun of,

297
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:54,722
and completely alienated
because of the way I was born,

298
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:59,685
because I'm attracted
to guys.

299
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:05,565
You can't fucking imagine how
powerless this makes someone feel,

300
00:17:05,565 --> 00:17:09,110
how powerless I felt.

301
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:11,946
All through high school,
I had to hide who I was

302
00:17:11,946 --> 00:17:15,574
for fear of people
finding out the truth.

303
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:20,037
I even dated girls.

304
00:17:20,037 --> 00:17:23,123
I had sex with them

305
00:17:23,123 --> 00:17:25,583
just so that...

306
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:27,752
people thought
that I was straight,

307
00:17:27,752 --> 00:17:32,840
that I was...normal.

308
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:36,302
And it tore me up inside.

309
00:17:40,264 --> 00:17:42,099
To the point where...

310
00:17:45,769 --> 00:17:47,520
Never mind.

311
00:17:47,562 --> 00:17:49,689
What?

312
00:17:49,689 --> 00:17:52,566
Nothing.
Um...

313
00:17:52,566 --> 00:17:55,110
Forget it.
Please. What?

314
00:17:58,447 --> 00:18:01,825
I tried to kill myself,
all right?

315
00:18:01,825 --> 00:18:04,494
I tried to commit
fucking suicide because...

316
00:18:04,494 --> 00:18:09,290
I couldn't deal
with who I was.

317
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:12,710
I was afraid of people
finding out the truth about me.

318
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:14,962
Are you serious?

319
00:18:14,962 --> 00:18:17,423
Yeah.

320
00:18:17,423 --> 00:18:19,341
I hated myself
for who I was.

321
00:18:22,385 --> 00:18:24,721
For who I am.

322
00:18:33,354 --> 00:18:35,231
Kinda pathetic, huh?

323
00:18:35,231 --> 00:18:36,732
No, man, it's not.

324
00:18:39,401 --> 00:18:43,363
Yeah, well, eventually...

325
00:18:43,363 --> 00:18:45,448
once I got to college, I
wasn't too different from you.

326
00:18:45,448 --> 00:18:48,284
I-I joined a frat
and drank lots of beer

327
00:18:48,284 --> 00:18:53,581
and made the usual
homoerotic gay jokes.

328
00:18:53,581 --> 00:18:56,208
Then I met a guy, and...

329
00:18:59,878 --> 00:19:01,922
He wasn't too different
from you and me.

330
00:19:04,716 --> 00:19:07,969
He helped me accept
who I am.

331
00:19:07,969 --> 00:19:10,221
Just a regular person...

332
00:19:10,221 --> 00:19:12,014
just like
everyone else.

333
00:19:14,934 --> 00:19:17,394
And it was kind of
crazy because

334
00:19:17,394 --> 00:19:19,563
as soon as I made
the decision to come out,

335
00:19:19,563 --> 00:19:23,567
that feeling of
powerlessness just vanished.

336
00:19:25,777 --> 00:19:31,032
Granted, I still have to deal
with my family and friends, but...

337
00:19:31,032 --> 00:19:33,117
as soon as I made that
decision that I was happy,

338
00:19:33,159 --> 00:19:35,619
that I loved myself,

339
00:19:35,619 --> 00:19:38,789
it didn't matter
what anyone else thought.

340
00:19:38,789 --> 00:19:41,500
It was like, "Fuck them
if they can't deal with it."

341
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,668
I'm gay.

342
00:19:43,668 --> 00:19:46,838
I've always been gay,
and I always will be gay.

343
00:19:49,841 --> 00:19:51,634
That's kinda cool, man.

344
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:25,915
Think I'm like
how you are?

345
00:20:25,915 --> 00:20:29,419
I'm not arrogant enough to
pretend to know who you are.

346
00:20:30,878 --> 00:20:35,090
You might be like me.
You might just be curious.

347
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:37,968
But either way,
whatever you are,

348
00:20:37,968 --> 00:20:41,430
don't try and cater
to other people's ideas

349
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:43,848
of what you should be.

350
00:20:45,475 --> 00:20:46,684
You just be you.

351
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:00,197
So, are you?

352
00:21:01,406 --> 00:21:02,949
What, gay?

353
00:21:09,122 --> 00:21:10,581
Yeah.

354
00:21:13,542 --> 00:21:15,044
I don't know.

355
00:21:17,838 --> 00:21:19,798
Still trying to figure
out if I liked it.

356
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:26,471
You wanna give it
another shot?

357
00:21:29,432 --> 00:21:31,058
Maybe you're a pitcher.

358
00:21:34,437 --> 00:21:36,522
As long as you promise
not to tell anyone.

359
00:21:42,486 --> 00:21:44,446
Yeah, why not?

360
00:21:55,873 --> 00:21:58,917
You okay?

361
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:00,502
I think so.

362
00:22:02,587 --> 00:22:04,506
Did you bleed?

363
00:22:09,052 --> 00:22:10,511
It doesn't
look like it.

364
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:15,015
Did the condom
stay on?

365
00:22:22,314 --> 00:22:24,858
Did it feel good?

366
00:22:24,858 --> 00:22:26,192
Yeah!

367
00:22:31,197 --> 00:22:32,365
Did it feel good for you?

368
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,326
I don't know.

369
00:22:35,326 --> 00:22:36,869
It kinda hurt,
but towards the end,

370
00:22:36,869 --> 00:22:38,537
I think it started
to feel good.

371
00:22:38,537 --> 00:22:40,080
You think?

372
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,083
Well, it all
happened so fast.

373
00:22:43,083 --> 00:22:44,542
What do you mean?

374
00:22:44,542 --> 00:22:46,086
It was just over
kinda quickly.

375
00:22:46,086 --> 00:22:47,420
It was my first time, too!

376
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:50,631
Oh, no, I know!
I wasn't complaining.

377
00:22:50,631 --> 00:22:52,883
It was...
I don't know.

378
00:22:52,883 --> 00:22:54,593
I feel kinda weird just
lying here naked with you.

379
00:22:54,593 --> 00:22:57,429
Yeah, me, too.

380
00:22:57,429 --> 00:22:59,556
The only other time
a girl's seen me naked

381
00:22:59,556 --> 00:23:01,850
was when Sherry Kelly gave me
a blowjob in the 10th grade.

382
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:03,894
Sherry Kelly
sucked your dick?

383
00:23:03,894 --> 00:23:05,478
You didn't know that?

384
00:23:05,478 --> 00:23:07,730
How would I know that?

385
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:09,774
Everyone at school knows!

386
00:23:09,774 --> 00:23:11,275
I threw up on her.

387
00:23:11,275 --> 00:23:13,152
What?

388
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:15,446
Yeah. It was my
first blowjob.

389
00:23:15,446 --> 00:23:18,031
I came the moment her lips
touched my dick.

390
00:23:18,031 --> 00:23:21,410
Anyway, when she was
cleaning me up down there...

391
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:22,994
I got so nervous,
I threw up.

392
00:23:22,994 --> 00:23:24,329
On her?

393
00:23:24,329 --> 00:23:27,499
Yeah, all over.

394
00:23:27,499 --> 00:23:29,334
She's never spoken
to me since.

395
00:23:29,334 --> 00:23:32,420
So, that's why she
doesn't talk to you?

396
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,296
Yep.

397
00:23:34,296 --> 00:23:35,673
I can't believe
she told people that.

398
00:23:35,673 --> 00:23:37,758
Well, in her defense,

399
00:23:37,758 --> 00:23:39,551
the only person she told
was Becky Matsuhara.

400
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:42,345
Becky was the evil bitch
who told everyone else.

401
00:23:42,345 --> 00:23:44,598
They called me
"Pukey Sam the Minuteman"

402
00:23:44,598 --> 00:23:46,307
for a whole year after that.

403
00:23:46,307 --> 00:23:50,394
Constant reminder of just how
much high school sucks ass.

404
00:23:50,394 --> 00:23:51,896
I'm sorry.

405
00:23:51,896 --> 00:23:54,607
Eh, don't worry about it.
It was a long time ago.

406
00:23:54,607 --> 00:23:56,567
Anyway, Becky got hit
by a garbage truck and died

407
00:23:56,567 --> 00:23:59,361
almost a year later
to the day.

408
00:23:59,361 --> 00:24:01,697
The universe works in
wonderful and mysterious ways.

409
00:24:05,575 --> 00:24:09,078
So, this really was
your first time?

410
00:24:09,078 --> 00:24:10,246
Yeah.

411
00:24:12,373 --> 00:24:13,749
What?
I don't know.

412
00:24:13,749 --> 00:24:16,293
It's just kinda cool,
that's all.

413
00:24:16,293 --> 00:24:18,253
Us losing our virginity
together.

414
00:24:21,131 --> 00:24:23,466
Oh, shit!

415
00:24:23,466 --> 00:24:25,385
What? Who is that?
I don't know.

416
00:24:25,385 --> 00:24:27,053
I thought you said
your parents were at work.

417
00:24:27,053 --> 00:24:28,179
They were. I thought
they were. Fuck!

418
00:24:28,179 --> 00:24:30,306
Get dressed really quick.
Shit!

419
00:24:30,306 --> 00:24:31,182
Get under the--
Get under the--

420
00:24:33,601 --> 00:24:34,685
I'm hurrying!

421
00:24:41,983 --> 00:24:43,235
Hey.
Hi, Mom.

422
00:24:44,903 --> 00:24:47,030
What are you doing?
Nothing.

423
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:50,700
Just...lying down.
I'm a little tired.

424
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,076
Well, were you
talking to someone?

425
00:24:52,076 --> 00:24:53,953
No.

426
00:24:53,953 --> 00:24:55,871
I mean, yeah.
Um, it was Bree.

427
00:24:55,871 --> 00:24:57,331
I just got off
the phone with her.

428
00:24:57,331 --> 00:24:59,875
Kristy, what's
going on here?

429
00:24:59,875 --> 00:25:00,917
What do you mean?

430
00:25:00,917 --> 00:25:02,419
Did you have
someone over here?

431
00:25:02,419 --> 00:25:04,713
No, why?
You sure?

432
00:25:04,713 --> 00:25:06,297
Yeah.

433
00:25:06,297 --> 00:25:08,883
Then why does it
smell in here?

434
00:25:08,883 --> 00:25:12,136
Mom, I don't know
what you're talking about.

435
00:25:12,136 --> 00:25:15,014
Kristy, I want you
to swear

436
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:16,098
that no one
was over here.

437
00:25:16,098 --> 00:25:17,349
I swear.

438
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:20,477
Okay.

439
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:28,359
Kristy, you know that
you can talk to me, right?

440
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:29,819
Yeah, sure.

441
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:33,781
I mean about boys
and, um...sex.

442
00:25:33,781 --> 00:25:35,533
Mom...

443
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:38,827
I don't know if your
father and I ever had...

444
00:25:38,827 --> 00:25:40,287
<i>that talk with you.</i>

445
00:25:40,287 --> 00:25:41,371
Mom...

446
00:25:41,371 --> 00:25:42,789
You know,
the sex talk.

447
00:25:42,789 --> 00:25:43,999
Anyway, it goes
like this.

448
00:25:43,999 --> 00:25:45,375
It, um...

449
00:25:45,375 --> 00:25:48,002
When-- When you reach
a certain age, you...

450
00:25:48,002 --> 00:25:50,755
you start having
feelings and--

451
00:25:50,755 --> 00:25:52,632
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

452
00:25:52,632 --> 00:25:55,759
Oh, you do?

453
00:25:55,759 --> 00:25:57,886
Yeah. I've known
since the sixth grade.

454
00:25:57,886 --> 00:26:00,055
Don't you remember when
I walked in on you and Dad

455
00:26:00,055 --> 00:26:02,224
doing it dressed like
Superman and Lois Lane

456
00:26:02,224 --> 00:26:03,683
while Tim,
the creepy guy next door,

457
00:26:03,683 --> 00:26:06,102
took notes dressed
as Jimmy the reporter?

458
00:26:06,102 --> 00:26:08,521
Oh...yeah.

459
00:26:10,356 --> 00:26:11,399
Well, um...

460
00:26:13,275 --> 00:26:14,693
Good. Right. Uh...

461
00:26:14,693 --> 00:26:16,570
So I'm here if--
if you ever want

462
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:17,696
to talk to me,
all right?

463
00:26:17,696 --> 00:26:20,949
And, um,
if you ever...

464
00:26:20,949 --> 00:26:23,326
are going to...

465
00:26:23,326 --> 00:26:27,789
do anything,
just please be careful.

466
00:26:27,789 --> 00:26:28,873
And, um...

467
00:26:28,873 --> 00:26:32,501
use, um...
you know...

468
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:35,462
a condom.

469
00:26:35,462 --> 00:26:36,964
Mom.
Okay, okay!

470
00:26:36,964 --> 00:26:38,882
I just want you
to be...

471
00:26:38,882 --> 00:26:40,634
I just want you
to be all right.

472
00:26:40,634 --> 00:26:42,511
I'm fine, Mom, thanks.

473
00:26:51,269 --> 00:26:53,813
Kristy?
Yeah?

474
00:26:53,813 --> 00:26:56,815
Better get him out of here
before your father gets home.

475
00:27:05,573 --> 00:27:07,242
Shit.

476
00:27:14,999 --> 00:27:17,042
I am so fucked.
Are you?

477
00:27:17,042 --> 00:27:19,545
Yeah, and you are, too, unless
you get the hell out of here.

478
00:27:19,545 --> 00:27:21,171
Enough said.

479
00:27:22,255 --> 00:27:24,716
What are you doing?

480
00:27:24,716 --> 00:27:26,593
Going out the balcony.
What does it look like?

481
00:27:26,593 --> 00:27:27,552
Just go out
the front door.

482
00:27:27,552 --> 00:27:29,262
My mom already
knows you're here.

483
00:27:29,262 --> 00:27:30,138
I'm not walking
past your mom

484
00:27:30,138 --> 00:27:31,556
after she knows
we just did it.

485
00:27:31,556 --> 00:27:33,599
You can deal with
an entire high school

486
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:35,643
full of people knowing you threw
up during your first blowjob,

487
00:27:35,643 --> 00:27:37,770
but you can't
walk past my mom?

488
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:39,229
Good point.

489
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:47,529
Nice.

490
00:27:47,529 --> 00:27:49,238
Yeah, it was nice.

491
00:27:51,157 --> 00:27:52,992
Get out of here!

492
00:28:07,589 --> 00:28:09,132
Bye.

493
00:28:09,132 --> 00:28:10,341
Bye.

494
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:40,327
<i># The specialness
of today... #</i>

495
00:28:40,327 --> 00:28:42,037
Well, that was nice.

496
00:28:42,037 --> 00:28:44,289
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

497
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:45,832
You wanna
do it again?

498
00:28:45,832 --> 00:28:48,501
No, not right now.
Okay.

499
00:28:48,501 --> 00:28:51,087
I just wanna marinate
in this for a while.

500
00:28:59,803 --> 00:29:03,723
You do know this is
just casual, right?

501
00:29:03,723 --> 00:29:05,183
Yeah, of course.

502
00:29:05,183 --> 00:29:06,392
Okay. Good.

503
00:29:06,392 --> 00:29:08,061
'Cause I don't want you
freaking out on me,

504
00:29:08,061 --> 00:29:10,063
catching feelings and shit.

505
00:29:10,063 --> 00:29:11,022
Look, I'm not into girls.

506
00:29:11,022 --> 00:29:12,940
I just like my pussy licked,

507
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:15,234
and you like to lick it.

508
00:29:15,234 --> 00:29:17,569
That's our dynamic,
no more, no less.

509
00:29:17,569 --> 00:29:19,112
Yeah.

510
00:29:19,112 --> 00:29:20,822
I just want you to get it
through your head right now--

511
00:29:20,822 --> 00:29:23,200
No, it's understood.

512
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,660
No feelings whatsoever.
Okay.

513
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:29,205
Anyway, I'm not--
I'm not gay either.

514
00:29:29,205 --> 00:29:30,957
You know, this is...

515
00:29:30,957 --> 00:29:32,625
It's fun.

516
00:29:32,625 --> 00:29:34,043
Okay, whatever.

517
00:29:34,043 --> 00:29:35,377
You don't have to hide
the fact that you're gay.

518
00:29:35,377 --> 00:29:37,713
I don't care.
I'm not.

519
00:29:37,713 --> 00:29:39,298
Look, you can do
whatever you want.

520
00:29:39,298 --> 00:29:41,967
I just don't want you falling
in love with me, that's all.

521
00:29:41,967 --> 00:29:43,760
I don't have patience
for that type of of bullshit,

522
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,136
man or woman.

523
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:48,348
Okay.

524
00:29:51,767 --> 00:29:55,771
Nikki, you think
I'm gay?

525
00:29:55,771 --> 00:29:56,897
Aren't you?

526
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:01,902
I mean, I don't know.

527
00:30:01,902 --> 00:30:04,946
Well, anyone that likes pussy as
much as you do has got to be gay.

528
00:30:04,946 --> 00:30:07,949
All right!
I like guys, too, okay?

529
00:30:07,949 --> 00:30:10,952
Really? When was the last
time you were with a guy?

530
00:30:10,952 --> 00:30:12,411
Uh, high school.

531
00:30:12,411 --> 00:30:14,205
Okay.
Did you like it?

532
00:30:15,998 --> 00:30:17,624
That's what
I thought.

533
00:30:17,624 --> 00:30:18,625
Look, who cares, okay?

534
00:30:18,625 --> 00:30:19,835
You like pussy,
I like dicks.

535
00:30:19,835 --> 00:30:21,461
No big deal.
Whoa, whoa.

536
00:30:21,461 --> 00:30:23,129
Do you have to be
so crude about it?

537
00:30:23,129 --> 00:30:24,965
What's that mean?

538
00:30:24,965 --> 00:30:26,674
I mean, like--
I don't know.

539
00:30:26,674 --> 00:30:28,760
You can be--
You can be...

540
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:32,305
really abrasive sometimes,
you know, that's all.

541
00:30:32,305 --> 00:30:34,849
No, that's the way
I talk.

542
00:30:34,849 --> 00:30:37,393
If you don't like it,
too fucking bad, okay?

543
00:30:37,393 --> 00:30:39,353
I'm blunt; I call it
as I see it.

544
00:30:39,353 --> 00:30:40,979
Really?
Yeah.

545
00:30:40,979 --> 00:30:42,022
You're an aspiring
rug muncher

546
00:30:42,022 --> 00:30:44,274
who makes me come.

547
00:30:44,274 --> 00:30:47,193
Well, I'm a raging bitch
who loves the cock.

548
00:30:47,193 --> 00:30:49,529
That's the reality
of the situation.

549
00:30:49,529 --> 00:30:51,405
Look, the only reason
I let you go down on me

550
00:30:51,405 --> 00:30:53,324
is because it's been a little
slow around the dorms lately.

551
00:30:53,324 --> 00:30:54,867
And well, frankly,
I'm a little bored

552
00:30:54,867 --> 00:30:56,243
with the selection
of available fuck sticks

553
00:30:56,243 --> 00:30:57,870
around here, okay?

554
00:30:59,997 --> 00:31:03,208
Oh, Jesus, Kat, please, please
do not get emotional on me, okay?

555
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:04,918
I'm not emotional!
Yes, you are!

556
00:31:04,918 --> 00:31:07,337
I'm a cunt, and you
should know that, okay?

557
00:31:07,337 --> 00:31:08,755
You're my fucking roommate,
for Christ's sake!

558
00:31:08,755 --> 00:31:10,465
Have you ever seen me
be nice to anyone?

559
00:31:10,465 --> 00:31:11,340
No, no, I guess not.

560
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,509
Okay, exactly.

561
00:31:13,509 --> 00:31:15,511
It's just that...

562
00:31:15,511 --> 00:31:18,222
you're so different when
we're fooling around, you know?

563
00:31:20,015 --> 00:31:22,851
Well, yeah! That's 'cause
you're getting me off.

564
00:31:22,851 --> 00:31:24,644
Oh, my God!
Like...

565
00:31:24,644 --> 00:31:26,187
Well, maybe
it's the only time

566
00:31:26,187 --> 00:31:27,981
I'm able to suppress my
fucking bitchiness long enough

567
00:31:27,981 --> 00:31:30,858
to appear like
a decent human being.

568
00:31:30,858 --> 00:31:33,652
Just in case I haven't
made it clear to you,

569
00:31:33,652 --> 00:31:35,154
Kat, I'm not.

570
00:31:39,241 --> 00:31:40,617
All right.
Okay.

571
00:31:46,498 --> 00:31:50,084
You do know
you're gay, right?

572
00:31:50,084 --> 00:31:52,169
Yeah.

573
00:31:52,169 --> 00:31:54,964
Is that the first time
you've ever said that?

574
00:31:54,964 --> 00:31:56,257
What, that I'm gay?

575
00:31:56,257 --> 00:31:57,758
Yeah.

576
00:31:57,758 --> 00:32:00,093
Yeah.

577
00:32:00,093 --> 00:32:01,970
Cool. I'm honored.

578
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:03,555
Oh, shut up.

579
00:32:03,555 --> 00:32:05,849
Look, Kat,
I'm serious, okay?

580
00:32:05,849 --> 00:32:08,434
Look, you're being honest with
yourself about who you are.

581
00:32:08,434 --> 00:32:11,938
I don't know. Maybe a little
bit of me is rubbing off on you.

582
00:32:11,938 --> 00:32:13,439
Oh, God forbid.

583
00:32:13,439 --> 00:32:15,900
What? As fucked up
as I may be,

584
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,277
I must have some
redeeming qualities, right?

585
00:32:18,277 --> 00:32:20,570
You definitely
have a few.

586
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:22,948
You are a slut.

587
00:32:22,948 --> 00:32:25,575
I can deal with that.
Okay.

588
00:32:25,575 --> 00:32:28,578
Just do me a favor and don't
repeat this conversation, okay?

589
00:32:28,578 --> 00:32:31,789
Okay. As long as you don't tell
anybody that you give me steady orgasms.

590
00:32:31,789 --> 00:32:32,832
Deal.

591
00:32:32,832 --> 00:32:34,917
Okay.

592
00:32:34,917 --> 00:32:38,545
So, what, you don't
want anyone to know?

593
00:32:38,545 --> 00:32:40,797
No, it's not that.
It's just...

594
00:32:40,797 --> 00:32:43,300
I want to do it on my
own timeline, you know?

595
00:32:43,341 --> 00:32:45,677
And besides,
it's nobody's business.

596
00:32:45,677 --> 00:32:48,054
Eventually,
I am gonna come out.

597
00:32:48,054 --> 00:32:50,181
Do your parents know?
Fuck no.

598
00:32:50,181 --> 00:32:51,766
They would shit
a solid gold brick

599
00:32:51,766 --> 00:32:53,351
if they were
to find out.

600
00:32:53,351 --> 00:32:55,853
Well, listen to you,
Miss Potty Mouth.

601
00:32:55,853 --> 00:32:58,230
Well, it must be
sexually contracted.

602
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:00,357
Oh, meh-maybe!

603
00:33:00,357 --> 00:33:02,526
But okay, I mean,
listen, Kat...

604
00:33:02,526 --> 00:33:04,194
what are they gonna do
when they find out?

605
00:33:04,194 --> 00:33:06,404
Oh, first, they'll
probably disown me.

606
00:33:06,404 --> 00:33:08,448
Then after a while
of not speaking to me,

607
00:33:08,448 --> 00:33:09,907
they'll act like
they're doing me a favor

608
00:33:09,907 --> 00:33:12,743
by having me explain
to them exactly why

609
00:33:12,743 --> 00:33:16,830
I'm making the decision
to be gay.

610
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:19,541
Oh, my God, that is
just so fucked up.

611
00:33:20,792 --> 00:33:22,544
Tell me about it.

612
00:33:24,587 --> 00:33:26,965
So what's it
taste like anyway?

613
00:33:26,965 --> 00:33:28,841
What?

614
00:33:28,841 --> 00:33:30,051
Pussy.

615
00:33:33,304 --> 00:33:34,597
I don't know.

616
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:38,434
Seriously,
I want to know.

617
00:33:39,893 --> 00:33:41,311
Well..

618
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,689
Wha--
You wanna know.

619
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,900
Oh, come on.
I don't want to know that bad, okay?

620
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:47,901
I'm just curious
is all.

621
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:50,445
Oh.

622
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:52,738
I don't know.
It tastes good.

623
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:55,157
I like it.

624
00:33:55,157 --> 00:33:58,118
Oh, really? I know
you like it, okay?

625
00:33:58,118 --> 00:34:01,163
I just-- I mean, like,
what does it taste like?

626
00:34:01,163 --> 00:34:03,123
Look, does it
taste like chicken?

627
00:34:03,123 --> 00:34:05,208
Does it taste
like potatoes?

628
00:34:05,208 --> 00:34:06,501
I mean, does it
taste like tuna?

629
00:34:06,501 --> 00:34:08,211
Don't!
Oh, I can't--

630
00:34:08,211 --> 00:34:09,670
No, it--
You know it smells like tuna.

631
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:13,049
No, it depends, okay?
It-- It depends.

632
00:34:13,049 --> 00:34:15,759
It's always a little
different and-- and...

633
00:34:17,886 --> 00:34:19,721
I guess a little salty.

634
00:34:21,723 --> 00:34:23,099
And everybody's unique.

635
00:34:26,478 --> 00:34:27,854
What do I taste like?

636
00:34:30,731 --> 00:34:31,816
What-- no--

637
00:34:31,816 --> 00:34:33,734
You asked, Nikki.

638
00:34:33,734 --> 00:34:36,820
I know,
but I just...

639
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:39,531
I just-- I mean, like, I would
just assume it's nasty, so--

640
00:34:39,531 --> 00:34:41,158
Why?

641
00:34:41,158 --> 00:34:44,577
It's a moist cavity
between your legs, Kat.

642
00:34:44,577 --> 00:34:45,829
A moist cavity?
I've nev--

643
00:34:45,829 --> 00:34:47,330
It is, okay?

644
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:49,165
And it sometimes
gets sweaty,

645
00:34:49,165 --> 00:34:50,458
so it sometimes
smells.

646
00:34:50,458 --> 00:34:52,084
It's just...

647
00:34:52,084 --> 00:34:53,669
It's just
a little gross.

648
00:34:53,669 --> 00:34:56,255
No, it's not.
You definitely...

649
00:34:56,255 --> 00:34:58,298
You want it clean.

650
00:35:04,387 --> 00:35:06,306
You honestly want to know
what you taste like?

651
00:35:09,475 --> 00:35:11,477
Well, I asked
didn't I?

652
00:35:11,477 --> 00:35:14,647
Okay. Come here.

653
00:35:22,779 --> 00:35:23,947
Open your legs.

654
00:35:41,129 --> 00:35:43,924
You taste...

655
00:35:43,924 --> 00:35:46,342
so fucking good.

656
00:35:49,637 --> 00:35:52,890
Okay, I'm no lesbo,
but that was really hot.

657
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:55,684
Yeah.
Uh-huh.

658
00:35:55,684 --> 00:35:59,188
Almost made me want
to go down on you.

659
00:35:59,188 --> 00:36:02,065
Really?
Almost.

660
00:36:06,861 --> 00:36:10,323
Uhh! Oh!

661
00:36:10,323 --> 00:36:12,533
I forgot how fun
that was!

662
00:36:12,533 --> 00:36:16,745
Well, speak for
yourself, old-timer.

663
00:36:16,745 --> 00:36:18,831
I'm gonna hunt down
and kill that doctor

664
00:36:18,831 --> 00:36:20,749
who gave you
those pills.

665
00:36:20,749 --> 00:36:23,210
Mmwah!

666
00:36:25,337 --> 00:36:27,172
Can I ask you something?

667
00:36:27,172 --> 00:36:28,673
I hate when you do that.

668
00:36:28,673 --> 00:36:30,341
Ask me if you're gonna
ask me something.

669
00:36:30,341 --> 00:36:32,802
You're already asking
me something

670
00:36:32,802 --> 00:36:34,845
by asking if you can
ask me something.

671
00:36:34,845 --> 00:36:36,430
Okay, I'm sorry.

672
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:38,098
So?
Well...

673
00:36:38,098 --> 00:36:40,559
if you had the chance to go
back in time and change things--

674
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:42,102
you know, like,
you and I being together,

675
00:36:42,102 --> 00:36:43,853
would you?

676
00:36:43,853 --> 00:36:47,690
Would I change anything
if I could go back in time?

677
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:49,734
Yeah.

678
00:36:49,734 --> 00:36:51,652
No.

679
00:36:51,652 --> 00:36:53,487
God, no.

680
00:36:53,487 --> 00:36:58,450
Gene, I wouldn't change
a single thing.

681
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:00,869
I couldn't have dreamed up
a better life

682
00:37:00,869 --> 00:37:04,456
in my best
night's sleep.

683
00:37:04,456 --> 00:37:07,083
You're still my knight
in shining armor.

684
00:37:07,083 --> 00:37:09,669
Always have been,
always will be.

685
00:37:09,669 --> 00:37:13,381
You're just as amazing
as the first night I met you.

686
00:37:13,381 --> 00:37:16,884
Who would have thought we would
have found love at a gangbang?

687
00:37:22,389 --> 00:37:24,516
Do you remember
that key party

688
00:37:24,516 --> 00:37:28,311
where old Walter Cotton couldn't
get his pecker out of my ass?

689
00:37:28,311 --> 00:37:29,937
Oh, yeah!

690
00:37:29,937 --> 00:37:31,355
Remember the look
on his face?

691
00:37:31,355 --> 00:37:33,607
Oh, sure do!
Ho ho!

692
00:37:33,607 --> 00:37:35,734
He was like
a helpless pup

693
00:37:35,734 --> 00:37:36,986
locked up with
a bitch in heat.

694
00:37:39,696 --> 00:37:42,616
All he was missing
was the amused owner

695
00:37:42,616 --> 00:37:45,035
chasing his little
water hose.

696
00:37:45,035 --> 00:37:47,120
You remember what
his wife Diane said

697
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,539
after he finally
got it out?

698
00:37:49,539 --> 00:37:51,832
Oh, yeah. She said,
"Who wants pudding?"

699
00:37:51,874 --> 00:37:53,459
Whoa, what's wrong
with that crazy woman?

700
00:37:53,459 --> 00:37:57,212
Oh, God!
So gross!

701
00:37:57,212 --> 00:38:00,757
Oh, he was a kick
in the pants, huh?

702
00:38:00,757 --> 00:38:01,925
And hung like a horse.

703
00:38:01,925 --> 00:38:03,051
You ain't lying.

704
00:38:03,051 --> 00:38:05,136
He had a dick so big
it'd choke a donkey.

705
00:38:05,136 --> 00:38:06,638
Looked like a baby's leg,
didn't it?

706
00:38:06,638 --> 00:38:08,306
Yeah...a fat baby.

707
00:38:10,141 --> 00:38:12,852
Sex was different
back then.

708
00:38:12,852 --> 00:38:17,189
Yeah. Everything was so
much more free, you know?

709
00:38:17,189 --> 00:38:20,108
No rules, no ambitions, no jealousies.

710
00:38:20,108 --> 00:38:21,777
Mm-hmm.

711
00:38:21,777 --> 00:38:24,946
No shaved pubic hair.
Mm-hmm.

712
00:38:24,946 --> 00:38:26,865
And no diseases that
you couldn't take care of

713
00:38:26,865 --> 00:38:28,283
with a visit
to the doctor

714
00:38:28,283 --> 00:38:29,867
and a quick shot
of penicillin.

715
00:38:29,867 --> 00:38:30,868
Today-- let me
tell you something--

716
00:38:30,868 --> 00:38:32,203
these kids gotta wear
a coat of armor

717
00:38:32,203 --> 00:38:34,788
before they park their car
in any woman's garage.

718
00:38:34,788 --> 00:38:35,998
I would wear
three or four.

719
00:38:35,998 --> 00:38:38,417
Yeah, you would.

720
00:38:38,417 --> 00:38:40,877
Do you remember
the night

721
00:38:40,877 --> 00:38:44,130
I brought home
LouAnn and Cecilia

722
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:47,050
after the Jefferson Airplane
show at the Fillmore?

723
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:49,427
The summer of 1969.
Uh-huh.

724
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:51,637
I couldn't forget that
if I tried.

725
00:38:51,637 --> 00:38:52,805
No matter
how long we live,

726
00:38:52,805 --> 00:38:55,140
I'll never be able to
repay you for that night.

727
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:57,017
I didn't know
fisting was possible.

728
00:38:57,017 --> 00:38:58,894
Oh, yeah,
it's possible.

729
00:38:58,894 --> 00:39:01,021
Hurts like a son of a gun,
but it's possible.

730
00:39:01,021 --> 00:39:04,024
That girl was cryin'! "Whaaa!" Yeah.

731
00:39:04,024 --> 00:39:05,942
She had pleasure
and pain at the same time.

732
00:39:05,942 --> 00:39:07,902
"Aahhh! Wahhhh!"

733
00:39:07,902 --> 00:39:09,695
Oh, God.

734
00:39:09,695 --> 00:39:10,488
Well, it hurt.

735
00:39:10,488 --> 00:39:12,406
Yeah.
"Wahhhh!"

736
00:39:12,406 --> 00:39:13,616
I'd say,
damn right it hurt.

737
00:39:13,616 --> 00:39:15,201
Somebody got their fist
up your damn thing, girl.

738
00:39:15,201 --> 00:39:17,077
Oh, God!

739
00:39:17,077 --> 00:39:19,454
It won't be
feeling good.

740
00:39:19,454 --> 00:39:22,082
Mwah!

741
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:32,717
What do you think
the kids would think

742
00:39:32,717 --> 00:39:35,261
if they knew about us?

743
00:39:35,261 --> 00:39:36,470
What, you mean
about our past?

744
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:38,680
Yeah.

745
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:43,768
You mean the swapping
and the...sex stuff?

746
00:39:43,768 --> 00:39:46,146
Yes, you numbskull.

747
00:39:46,146 --> 00:39:47,313
I swear,
sometimes I think

748
00:39:47,313 --> 00:39:49,399
you're as thickheaded
as a mule.

749
00:39:49,399 --> 00:39:51,442
You don't have
to be so nasty.

750
00:39:51,442 --> 00:39:53,152
Maybe they'll have
heart attacks.

751
00:39:53,152 --> 00:39:54,195
You think?

752
00:39:54,195 --> 00:39:55,988
Who would want to think
about their parents

753
00:39:55,988 --> 00:39:57,156
doing the bang-bang-bang?

754
00:39:57,156 --> 00:39:59,157
You know, bang, bang,
bang, bang, bang.

755
00:39:59,157 --> 00:40:00,242
Daddy got his
drawers off,

756
00:40:00,242 --> 00:40:01,701
big old butt sticking
up in the air.

757
00:40:01,701 --> 00:40:02,661
Bang, bang.
Bang, bang, bang.

758
00:40:02,661 --> 00:40:05,663
Oh, shut up.

759
00:40:08,166 --> 00:40:10,251
I always wondered
if they knew.

760
00:40:15,005 --> 00:40:19,509
Nah. No way.
Mm-mmm.

761
00:40:19,509 --> 00:40:22,596
Do you think, uh--
You think they'd be ashamed?

762
00:40:22,596 --> 00:40:26,516
I don't know; it's hard to
figure out what they think.

763
00:40:26,516 --> 00:40:29,727
Yeah, well, I guess there's no
use in worrying about it now.

764
00:40:29,727 --> 00:40:32,104
No use at all.
Let me tell you something.

765
00:40:32,104 --> 00:40:35,399
We made our decisions, and we lived
through them, and now we're here.

766
00:40:35,399 --> 00:40:37,776
What more
can we ask for?

767
00:40:37,776 --> 00:40:39,486
Yeah, you're right.

768
00:40:39,486 --> 00:40:41,738
I know I'm right,
baby doll.

769
00:40:41,738 --> 00:40:43,240
Shit, after 40 years
of marriage,

770
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,492
you think you would
figure that out by now.

771
00:40:45,492 --> 00:40:48,077
35 years, Gene.

772
00:40:48,077 --> 00:40:49,537
40, sugar dumplings.

773
00:40:49,537 --> 00:40:51,581
35, honey bun.

774
00:40:51,581 --> 00:40:54,166
Cupcakes, 40.

775
00:40:54,166 --> 00:40:56,001
Gene?
Hmm?

776
00:40:56,001 --> 00:40:57,586
What year were we married?

777
00:40:59,254 --> 00:41:01,590
40 years ago.

778
00:41:12,141 --> 00:41:15,019
You ever think
we'd end up here?

779
00:41:15,019 --> 00:41:16,312
What do you mean,
"here"?

780
00:41:16,312 --> 00:41:19,898
You know, me, you,
together, old?

781
00:41:19,898 --> 00:41:22,359
We're not that old.

782
00:41:22,359 --> 00:41:24,110
Yeah.

783
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:25,945
We're no spring chickens,
I'll tell you that.

784
00:41:25,945 --> 00:41:27,322
Well, we're not old.

785
00:41:27,322 --> 00:41:30,867
Old is Bea Arthur
and Bob Hope and...

786
00:41:30,867 --> 00:41:33,119
What's that guy
that owns everything?

787
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:34,286
Ted Turner?
Yeah.

788
00:41:34,286 --> 00:41:37,331
They're old.
We're not old.

789
00:41:37,331 --> 00:41:39,333
We're...refined.

790
00:41:39,333 --> 00:41:42,210
But Bob Hope is dead.

791
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:44,921
Yeah, true.

792
00:41:44,921 --> 00:41:47,924
But to answer
your question,

793
00:41:47,924 --> 00:41:50,176
I don't know if I ever
thought we'd end up here.

794
00:41:50,176 --> 00:41:52,470
I don't know.

795
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:54,305
I hoped.

796
00:41:54,305 --> 00:41:57,099
Yeah.
Me, too.

797
00:41:57,099 --> 00:41:59,268
You know, out of all
the other women

798
00:41:59,268 --> 00:42:01,436
I buried my bone in--

799
00:42:01,436 --> 00:42:04,606
and you know me, I buried
my bone in a lot of them--

800
00:42:04,606 --> 00:42:08,359
there was never
anyone but you.

801
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:12,280
You've always had
a way with words, Gene.

802
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:16,867
You old sweet thing, you.
Come on.

803
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:18,202
Don't call me old.

804
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:19,453
Bite you.

805
00:42:25,875 --> 00:42:28,503
Fucking--
Gotta be--

806
00:42:28,503 --> 00:42:31,756
Goddammit!
Get off me!

807
00:42:34,216 --> 00:42:35,926
Whoo!

808
00:42:35,926 --> 00:42:38,053
Can't you come
a little quicker?

809
00:42:38,053 --> 00:42:41,973
No, bro.

810
00:42:41,973 --> 00:42:44,934
Oh, buddy.

811
00:42:44,934 --> 00:42:47,020
Mm! Oh, fuck, bro.

812
00:42:47,061 --> 00:42:49,689
Man, wow,
that was rockin'.

813
00:42:49,689 --> 00:42:51,899
Rock and roll, man!

814
00:42:51,899 --> 00:42:53,567
Put 'er there, buddy.

815
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:55,986
Aah! That hurts!

816
00:42:55,986 --> 00:42:57,237
Mmm!

817
00:42:57,237 --> 00:42:58,405
Oh, fuckin'...

818
00:42:58,405 --> 00:43:01,199
Uhh!
Whoo!

819
00:43:03,743 --> 00:43:05,036
So what do you
want to do?

820
00:43:05,036 --> 00:43:06,579
I don't know.

821
00:43:06,579 --> 00:43:08,206
What's everybody else
doing, man?

822
00:43:08,206 --> 00:43:09,290
They're going dancing.

823
00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:10,541
They're heading down
to Boys Town.

824
00:43:10,541 --> 00:43:12,543
It's '80s night
at Rage.

825
00:43:14,086 --> 00:43:16,255
God, our friends are
so fucking gay, man.

826
00:43:16,255 --> 00:43:17,965
Tell me about it.

827
00:43:17,965 --> 00:43:21,051
So what do you think?
I don't know.

828
00:43:21,051 --> 00:43:22,969
Any other ideas?
I don't know.

829
00:43:22,969 --> 00:43:24,054
We could stay up
all night

830
00:43:24,054 --> 00:43:25,889
and have sex
like rock stars,

831
00:43:25,889 --> 00:43:28,433
keep up the neighbors,
sweat...

832
00:43:28,433 --> 00:43:29,976
shake the earth.

833
00:43:31,811 --> 00:43:34,730
Sounds pretty nice,
but...I wasn't joking.

834
00:43:34,730 --> 00:43:36,231
My ass kinda hurts.

835
00:43:36,231 --> 00:43:38,233
Wanna go catch a movie
or something?

836
00:43:38,233 --> 00:43:40,569
Oh, yeah?
What's out?

837
00:43:40,569 --> 00:43:41,737
Not much.

838
00:43:41,737 --> 00:43:43,655
Seems the only entertainment
I've been getting

839
00:43:43,655 --> 00:43:46,991
from going to the theater is
watching some poor sap pay 12.50

840
00:43:46,991 --> 00:43:51,913
to see some half-assed recycled
excuse for a motion picture.

841
00:43:51,913 --> 00:43:53,873
Yeah, man.

842
00:43:53,873 --> 00:43:54,915
Well, we're two of those
poor saps, mister.

843
00:44:00,504 --> 00:44:03,173
I wanna drive.

844
00:44:03,173 --> 00:44:04,716
I'm driving.

845
00:44:12,139 --> 00:44:15,434
So, uh, how's this
gonna work, man?

846
00:44:15,434 --> 00:44:18,061
What do you mean?

847
00:44:18,061 --> 00:44:21,773
I mean, how's this
gonna work?

848
00:44:21,773 --> 00:44:24,859
You mean us?
Yes, Bob.

849
00:44:24,859 --> 00:44:27,779
I don't know, Neil.
Why do you ask?

850
00:44:27,779 --> 00:44:29,906
'Cause I wanna fucking know, that's why.

851
00:44:29,906 --> 00:44:31,782
Well, I don't have a
fucking answer, all right?

852
00:44:33,909 --> 00:44:36,662
My ass is so sore.

853
00:44:36,662 --> 00:44:38,997
Well, don't expect me
to be the fucking bitch

854
00:44:38,997 --> 00:44:42,334
in this relationship,
you got it?

855
00:44:42,334 --> 00:44:43,710
I'm the butch.

856
00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:45,628
I've always been
the butch.

857
00:44:45,628 --> 00:44:47,338
I'll always
be the butch.

858
00:44:49,632 --> 00:44:52,009
Neil's the fucking butch,
you know what I mean?

859
00:44:52,009 --> 00:44:53,135
Fucking Christ,
do we have to have

860
00:44:53,135 --> 00:44:54,762
the State of the Union
talk right fucking now?

861
00:44:54,762 --> 00:44:58,182
Yeah. Yeah, we do.
What--

862
00:44:58,182 --> 00:44:59,308
I'm no bitch!

863
00:44:59,308 --> 00:45:01,727
Well, that's our
problem, Einstein.

864
00:45:01,727 --> 00:45:03,687
Why does it have to be
a fucking problem?

865
00:45:03,687 --> 00:45:05,522
'Cause that's the way
it fucking works, man.

866
00:45:05,522 --> 00:45:08,149
There's the bitch
and there's the butch.

867
00:45:08,149 --> 00:45:10,776
I don't make
the rules, okay?

868
00:45:10,776 --> 00:45:12,737
That's so passé.

869
00:45:12,737 --> 00:45:13,612
Passé?

870
00:45:13,612 --> 00:45:16,573
Yes, passé.

871
00:45:16,573 --> 00:45:20,077
Ladies and gentlemen, I believe
we've found ourselves a bitch!

872
00:45:21,912 --> 00:45:23,038
Pull over.

873
00:45:23,038 --> 00:45:24,414
Pull over.

874
00:45:24,414 --> 00:45:27,417
So where were we?

875
00:45:27,417 --> 00:45:28,918
Oh, yeah.

876
00:45:28,918 --> 00:45:32,254
Listen, just because
the heterosexual public

877
00:45:32,254 --> 00:45:34,673
has a uniformed
stereotype

878
00:45:34,673 --> 00:45:37,092
of what a normal gay
couple's dynamic should be

879
00:45:37,092 --> 00:45:39,553
doesn't mean that we,
the gay community,

880
00:45:39,553 --> 00:45:42,681
have to abide by their
small-minded perceptions

881
00:45:42,681 --> 00:45:45,308
and their inability
to think outside the box.

882
00:45:45,308 --> 00:45:47,268
So what are you
proposing?

883
00:45:47,268 --> 00:45:49,187
I'm not proposing
anything.

884
00:45:49,187 --> 00:45:51,439
I'm just saying that
just because people expect

885
00:45:51,439 --> 00:45:53,649
a bitch and a butch
doesn't--

886
00:45:53,649 --> 00:45:57,736
that doesn't mean that's
the way it has to be.

887
00:45:57,736 --> 00:45:58,946
I mean, look at
Ingrid and Sarah.

888
00:45:58,946 --> 00:46:01,531
They're both fucking
butch as fuck,

889
00:46:01,531 --> 00:46:03,241
and they've been
happily together

890
00:46:03,241 --> 00:46:06,536
for fucking over
5-1/2 years now?

891
00:46:06,536 --> 00:46:08,121
You're right.

892
00:46:08,121 --> 00:46:10,623
Lesbians are so
ahead of the curve.

893
00:46:10,623 --> 00:46:13,876
They are. They're on top
of their fucking game, man.

894
00:46:13,876 --> 00:46:15,920
And you don't see the
two of them feeling bad

895
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:19,131
for not fitting into the
socially expected archetypes

896
00:46:19,131 --> 00:46:21,550
of what a happy
gay couple should be.

897
00:46:21,550 --> 00:46:23,635
Neil, I just--

898
00:46:23,635 --> 00:46:26,888
I don't understand why this
is bothering you so much.

899
00:46:26,888 --> 00:46:28,598
I don't know,
it's just that...

900
00:46:28,598 --> 00:46:32,268
all the gay couples
we know,

901
00:46:32,268 --> 00:46:33,936
there's a masculine
and a fem.

902
00:46:33,936 --> 00:46:35,813
So?

903
00:46:35,813 --> 00:46:39,274
I don't know, it's just
rare that a gay couple

904
00:46:39,274 --> 00:46:40,776
breaks the mold,
that's all.

905
00:46:40,776 --> 00:46:41,902
I think you're
forgetting

906
00:46:41,902 --> 00:46:44,404
about the first
gay couple, man.

907
00:46:44,404 --> 00:46:45,447
Who's that?

908
00:46:45,447 --> 00:46:47,240
R2-D2 and C-3PO.

909
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:48,574
What are you
talking about?

910
00:46:48,574 --> 00:46:51,619
C-3PO was a total bitch.

911
00:46:51,619 --> 00:46:55,122
Oh, Lord, I do hope we make it
to the launch pad on time.

912
00:46:55,122 --> 00:46:57,875
Hurry, R2.
Hurry.

913
00:46:57,875 --> 00:47:00,794
Faggots, man.
Faggot talk.

914
00:47:00,794 --> 00:47:03,880
Yeah, but what
was R2, then?

915
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:06,466
Oh, okay. I think I see
where you're going with this.

916
00:47:06,466 --> 00:47:09,844
See? I mean, some can argue
that R2 was the bitch,

917
00:47:09,844 --> 00:47:12,555
I mean, for constantly
putting up with 3PO's shit.

918
00:47:12,555 --> 00:47:13,931
And continuing
to hang out with him

919
00:47:13,931 --> 00:47:15,099
even though
the persistent nagging

920
00:47:15,099 --> 00:47:18,519
by that fucking
British twat.

921
00:47:18,519 --> 00:47:19,811
You made your point.

922
00:47:19,811 --> 00:47:22,814
But on a small
side note,

923
00:47:22,814 --> 00:47:26,192
R2 and 3P0 weren't
the fist gay couple.

924
00:47:26,192 --> 00:47:28,486
What? Shut up.
Of course they were.

925
00:47:28,486 --> 00:47:30,530
Nope, you're wrong.

926
00:47:30,530 --> 00:47:31,906
Who was it, then?

927
00:47:31,906 --> 00:47:34,158
Gilligan and the Skipper.

928
00:47:34,158 --> 00:47:36,243
Oh, shit!
Yeah.

929
00:47:36,243 --> 00:47:37,745
I never thought
about it like that.

930
00:47:37,745 --> 00:47:39,663
You never thought about that?
You kidding me?

931
00:47:39,663 --> 00:47:42,582
You never noticed
the pet name "Little Buddy"?

932
00:47:42,582 --> 00:47:43,875
Come on!

933
00:47:43,917 --> 00:47:45,960
And the fact that
Ginger and Mary Ann,

934
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:48,421
those fine little
pieces of ass,

935
00:47:48,421 --> 00:47:51,173
never got any action
from either one of them?

936
00:47:51,173 --> 00:47:52,758
They were fucking
hot, too.

937
00:47:52,758 --> 00:47:55,928
Yeah, if they only
had dicks.

938
00:47:55,928 --> 00:47:56,970
And a mouthful.

939
00:47:59,348 --> 00:48:00,849
Oh, yeah.

940
00:48:00,849 --> 00:48:04,477
So I guess no one
has to be the bitch.

941
00:48:04,477 --> 00:48:08,147
Neil, neither of us are
capable of being the bitch.

942
00:48:08,147 --> 00:48:09,941
You're the lead singer
of a hair band,

943
00:48:09,941 --> 00:48:12,151
and I'm a high school
football coach.

944
00:48:12,151 --> 00:48:14,528
We both hate the fuck
out of Barbra Streisand.

945
00:48:14,528 --> 00:48:16,113
Shit.

946
00:48:16,113 --> 00:48:17,489
Listen, I don't know
how it works,

947
00:48:17,489 --> 00:48:18,657
but it does,
all right?

948
00:48:18,657 --> 00:48:22,119
And...I'm not
gonna change,

949
00:48:22,119 --> 00:48:23,787
and I know you're
not gonna change,

950
00:48:23,787 --> 00:48:26,498
so why should we
fucking change, then?

951
00:48:26,498 --> 00:48:28,583
I mean,
you're happy, right?

952
00:48:28,583 --> 00:48:29,542
Oh, yeah.

953
00:48:29,542 --> 00:48:31,252
And I'm happy, too.
Yeah.

954
00:48:31,252 --> 00:48:33,170
So fuck everyone!

955
00:48:40,218 --> 00:48:43,680
Neil?
Yeah?

956
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:46,224
Thanks.

957
00:48:46,224 --> 00:48:47,392
For what?

958
00:48:47,392 --> 00:48:48,726
For just being you.

959
00:48:48,726 --> 00:48:50,645
Yeah, no problem.

960
00:48:52,271 --> 00:48:53,898
What?

961
00:48:53,898 --> 00:48:55,191
What what?

962
00:48:55,191 --> 00:48:57,901
I'm glad we're together,
you know, and...

963
00:48:57,901 --> 00:49:00,237
I'm really glad we...

964
00:49:00,237 --> 00:49:03,240
we can talk the way
we do, you know?

965
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:06,534
I'm just-- I'm...

966
00:49:06,534 --> 00:49:09,328
I've never been able to talk to
someone the way I talk to you.

967
00:49:09,328 --> 00:49:10,413
How did this
suddenly turn into

968
00:49:10,413 --> 00:49:12,957
<i>an After School
Special, man?</i>

969
00:49:12,957 --> 00:49:14,500
Come on, Neil...

970
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:16,835
just 'cause
you're a manly man

971
00:49:16,835 --> 00:49:18,921
doesn't mean you
can't have a heart.

972
00:49:18,921 --> 00:49:21,214
Yeah.
Be Neil here.

973
00:49:21,214 --> 00:49:23,258
I'm just sayin'
I don't...

974
00:49:27,303 --> 00:49:29,305
I just want you
to know that...

975
00:49:29,305 --> 00:49:31,807
I appreciate you,
you know?

976
00:49:31,849 --> 00:49:33,934
Are you serious?

977
00:49:33,934 --> 00:49:35,853
Yeah, I'm serious.

978
00:49:35,853 --> 00:49:37,813
Cool.

979
00:49:37,813 --> 00:49:39,231
Thanks.

980
00:49:42,526 --> 00:49:44,527
I appreciate you,
too, you know.

981
00:49:44,527 --> 00:49:46,696
I'm sorry if I, uh...

982
00:49:46,696 --> 00:49:48,197
don't express my feelings.

983
00:49:48,197 --> 00:49:52,118
It's just-- that's not
really my thing, you know?

984
00:49:52,118 --> 00:49:55,204
<i>Jesus, now I sound like
I'm an After School Special.</i>

985
00:49:57,456 --> 00:49:59,124
It's okay.

986
00:50:01,043 --> 00:50:03,378
I know your deal.

987
00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:25,774
Why do we do this?

988
00:50:25,774 --> 00:50:26,941
I don't know.

989
00:50:26,941 --> 00:50:29,277
It was good, though.

990
00:50:29,277 --> 00:50:30,945
It's always good.

991
00:50:30,945 --> 00:50:33,948
That was never the
problem with us, David.

992
00:50:33,948 --> 00:50:36,450
Yeah, so what
was the problem?

993
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:38,911
The problem is you.

994
00:50:41,955 --> 00:50:43,373
Me?

995
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:44,958
Yeah, you.

996
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:46,709
You're emotionally
unavailable

997
00:50:46,709 --> 00:50:48,252
and completely
unwilling

998
00:50:48,252 --> 00:50:50,546
to open yourself up
to anyone.

999
00:50:50,546 --> 00:50:52,006
That is not true.

1000
00:50:52,006 --> 00:50:54,633
I'm completely
open with Yesenia.

1001
00:50:54,633 --> 00:50:57,469
Her name is Yesenia?

1002
00:50:57,469 --> 00:50:58,887
Yeah. What's wrong
with that?

1003
00:50:58,887 --> 00:51:02,349
Nothing.
Never mind.

1004
00:51:02,349 --> 00:51:04,476
Anyway, that's why we're
no longer together,

1005
00:51:04,476 --> 00:51:06,227
whether you want to
fess up to it or not.

1006
00:51:06,227 --> 00:51:07,353
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

1007
00:51:07,395 --> 00:51:08,813
So you're saying
the only reason

1008
00:51:08,813 --> 00:51:12,149
that we broke up
was because of me?

1009
00:51:12,149 --> 00:51:13,234
Yeah.

1010
00:51:13,234 --> 00:51:15,402
What about you?

1011
00:51:15,402 --> 00:51:17,863
What about me?
Hmm, let's see.

1012
00:51:17,863 --> 00:51:20,866
You were totally jealous,
completely insecure,

1013
00:51:20,866 --> 00:51:22,784
and always certain that
I was cheating on you.

1014
00:51:22,784 --> 00:51:26,538
<i>You were always
cheating on me.</i>

1015
00:51:26,538 --> 00:51:29,916
Yeah, but you didn't
know that.

1016
00:51:29,916 --> 00:51:32,001
Here's what your
problem is, Jordy.

1017
00:51:32,001 --> 00:51:34,420
You are unable
to trust anyone.

1018
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:37,631
That's bullshit.
I trust Greg.

1019
00:51:37,631 --> 00:51:40,509
Wait. His name is Greg,
like Greg Brady?

1020
00:51:40,509 --> 00:51:41,510
I love that guy.

1021
00:51:41,510 --> 00:51:42,969
I used to watch
that guy growing up.

1022
00:51:42,969 --> 00:51:44,638
I'm a big fan.

1023
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,265
Yeah, so?
He's nice.

1024
00:51:47,265 --> 00:51:49,642
And he doesn't stick his dick
in everything that moves.

1025
00:51:52,311 --> 00:51:54,855
So I like women?
So what?

1026
00:51:54,855 --> 00:51:58,066
David, when you're
with someone,

1027
00:51:58,066 --> 00:52:00,527
you know, together,

1028
00:52:00,527 --> 00:52:02,612
the idea is that
you're only with them.

1029
00:52:02,612 --> 00:52:05,573
I told you my weaknesses
from the very beginning.

1030
00:52:05,573 --> 00:52:07,700
You also told me
you'd change.

1031
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:08,785
You said you loved me.

1032
00:52:08,785 --> 00:52:11,579
I did love you.

1033
00:52:11,579 --> 00:52:13,414
And yet you still
managed to fuck

1034
00:52:13,414 --> 00:52:14,498
the majority
of my friends,

1035
00:52:14,498 --> 00:52:16,375
one in my own bed,
no less.

1036
00:52:16,375 --> 00:52:19,169
Oh, and this Greg is just the
king of monogamy, I presume?

1037
00:52:19,169 --> 00:52:21,880
Greg and I have been
together for over a year,

1038
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:24,799
and he has not so much
as looked at another girl.

1039
00:52:26,009 --> 00:52:27,385
That's what you think.

1040
00:52:27,385 --> 00:52:30,054
That's what I know.

1041
00:52:30,054 --> 00:52:32,807
Greg and I are in love.

1042
00:52:32,807 --> 00:52:35,893
Then...why are you here?

1043
00:52:35,935 --> 00:52:37,186
Why are you here?

1044
00:52:37,186 --> 00:52:39,313
Look, I'm not the one
claiming to be in love.

1045
00:52:39,313 --> 00:52:42,732
Yesenia's just a...
a thing, you know?

1046
00:52:42,774 --> 00:52:44,484
She knows the deal.

1047
00:52:44,484 --> 00:52:47,028
Oh. So...

1048
00:52:47,028 --> 00:52:48,321
she'd have no problem

1049
00:52:48,321 --> 00:52:49,781
knowing that you just
rented a room in a hotel

1050
00:52:49,781 --> 00:52:52,074
so you could fuck
your ex-girlfriend?

1051
00:52:52,116 --> 00:52:54,326
Don't analyze me. I don't
need that shit right now.

1052
00:52:54,326 --> 00:52:55,995
Why, 'cause it's
the truth?

1053
00:52:55,995 --> 00:52:57,663
No, because you're not
a fucking psychiatrist.

1054
00:52:57,663 --> 00:52:59,289
I'm not paying you
a hundred dollars an hour

1055
00:52:59,289 --> 00:53:00,540
to figure out
what's wrong with me.

1056
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:04,002
You're just mad because
you know I'm dead-on.

1057
00:53:04,002 --> 00:53:06,254
So what if you're dead-on.
What does that prove?

1058
00:53:06,254 --> 00:53:08,172
It proves exactly
what I said before.

1059
00:53:10,216 --> 00:53:12,176
You're fucking delusional,
you know that?

1060
00:53:16,138 --> 00:53:18,682
If that's not the pot
calling the kettle black...

1061
00:53:18,682 --> 00:53:20,767
What?

1062
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:22,769
Look, I know what I am,
and I'm fine with it.

1063
00:53:22,769 --> 00:53:25,397
You, on the other hand, are caught
up in this fucking fantasy world

1064
00:53:25,397 --> 00:53:26,523
where everyone
is who you want them to be,

1065
00:53:26,523 --> 00:53:28,691
but not who they are.

1066
00:53:33,029 --> 00:53:35,030
The truth hurts,
don't it?

1067
00:53:35,030 --> 00:53:37,032
Fuck you.

1068
00:53:37,032 --> 00:53:38,909
Aw. Now you're gonna
get all mad at me

1069
00:53:38,909 --> 00:53:40,285
because I told you
the truth

1070
00:53:40,285 --> 00:53:42,120
after you blasted me out of
the water with your judgment?

1071
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:44,080
Fuck you.

1072
00:53:45,915 --> 00:53:49,961
And you wonder
why I left.

1073
00:53:49,961 --> 00:53:52,296
Oh, that's rich.
That's good, Jordy.

1074
00:53:52,296 --> 00:53:54,590
You left.
Well, that's not really the way that I remember it.

1075
00:53:54,590 --> 00:53:56,925
But that's okay. We can go back and
rewrite the book of "David and Jordy."

1076
00:53:56,925 --> 00:53:59,469
Oh, just shut up,
okay?

1077
00:53:59,469 --> 00:54:01,596
Okay.

1078
00:54:07,936 --> 00:54:09,062
You don't still
have feelings for me?

1079
00:54:09,062 --> 00:54:12,315
No, of course not.
I am so over you.

1080
00:54:12,315 --> 00:54:13,774
Okay, well, you never
answered me, then.

1081
00:54:13,774 --> 00:54:15,401
Why are you here?

1082
00:54:15,401 --> 00:54:17,736
You never answered
me either.

1083
00:54:17,736 --> 00:54:19,780
With what?
Why are you here?

1084
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:20,989
Jesus Christ, Jordy.

1085
00:54:20,989 --> 00:54:24,075
I thought we pretty much
covered this, didn't we?

1086
00:54:24,075 --> 00:54:26,327
Okay, to paraphrase
the long and tedious subject

1087
00:54:26,369 --> 00:54:29,622
that we just discussed,
I am a womanizer, okay?

1088
00:54:29,622 --> 00:54:31,457
I like all different
types of women.

1089
00:54:31,457 --> 00:54:32,708
I like the way
that they smell.

1090
00:54:32,708 --> 00:54:33,959
I like the way
that they taste.

1091
00:54:33,959 --> 00:54:35,211
I like the way
that they fuck!

1092
00:54:35,211 --> 00:54:36,670
The problem is
I find it hard

1093
00:54:36,670 --> 00:54:38,630
to stay loyal or honest
to one particular woman

1094
00:54:38,630 --> 00:54:40,173
at one particular time.

1095
00:54:40,173 --> 00:54:41,466
There, I said it.
Fine. Are you happy?

1096
00:54:41,466 --> 00:54:43,552
Now why are you here?

1097
00:54:45,595 --> 00:54:47,055
I don't know.

1098
00:54:48,556 --> 00:54:51,392
I really don't know.

1099
00:54:54,228 --> 00:54:56,772
Look, are you happy
with...Tom?

1100
00:54:56,772 --> 00:54:58,398
John? What the fuck
is his name again?

1101
00:54:58,398 --> 00:54:59,733
Greg.
Yeah, Greg.

1102
00:54:59,733 --> 00:55:01,193
Aren't you happy
with Greg?

1103
00:55:01,193 --> 00:55:04,779
Yeah. I mean,
yes, I am.

1104
00:55:04,779 --> 00:55:05,780
Then why?

1105
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:06,865
I don't have an answer.

1106
00:55:06,865 --> 00:55:08,991
I don't fucking know,
all right?

1107
00:55:08,991 --> 00:55:11,577
All right, Jesus.
No need to get hostile.

1108
00:55:11,577 --> 00:55:13,579
I was just wondering,

1109
00:55:13,579 --> 00:55:14,955
since we're in such
an honest mood here tonight,

1110
00:55:14,955 --> 00:55:16,457
laying naked
beside one another,

1111
00:55:16,457 --> 00:55:18,625
just having shared the most
intimate of body fluids,

1112
00:55:18,625 --> 00:55:21,837
I thought we could
just kind of...wshhhh,

1113
00:55:21,837 --> 00:55:24,464
just get everything
out in the open.

1114
00:55:24,464 --> 00:55:26,341
Look, we know why I'm
cheating on my girlfriend,

1115
00:55:26,341 --> 00:55:27,467
because I'm a piece
of shit.

1116
00:55:27,467 --> 00:55:29,510
But at least
I know what I am,

1117
00:55:29,510 --> 00:55:31,470
and I'm honest
with myself about it.

1118
00:55:31,470 --> 00:55:33,639
Yeah, unfortunately,
you're the only person

1119
00:55:33,639 --> 00:55:36,141
you have the ability
to be honest to.

1120
00:55:39,603 --> 00:55:40,854
It's only because
I'm compassionate.

1121
00:55:43,064 --> 00:55:44,983
What the fuck are
you talking about?

1122
00:55:44,983 --> 00:55:46,943
The only reason
that I lie to women

1123
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:48,569
is to protect them
from being hurt.

1124
00:55:48,569 --> 00:55:50,279
Oh, my God!

1125
00:55:50,279 --> 00:55:53,824
You drive me
fucking crazy!

1126
00:55:53,824 --> 00:55:56,118
I mean, it's just--
it's amazing to me

1127
00:55:56,118 --> 00:55:59,371
how you can justify
your lying and womanizing

1128
00:55:59,371 --> 00:56:02,040
by believing that you're
doing us women a favor.

1129
00:56:02,082 --> 00:56:03,667
Like we couldn't
handle the truth.

1130
00:56:03,667 --> 00:56:05,043
Well, could you?

1131
00:56:05,085 --> 00:56:07,378
I don't know.

1132
00:56:07,378 --> 00:56:10,923
But at least we wouldn't
end up with broken hearts.

1133
00:56:10,923 --> 00:56:13,300
I mean, you think
you're doing us a favor?

1134
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:15,803
You think you're
being compassionate

1135
00:56:15,803 --> 00:56:18,847
by letting us think
that we're the only ones?

1136
00:56:18,847 --> 00:56:22,767
No, you're the one that's
fucking delusional, David.

1137
00:56:22,767 --> 00:56:25,520
All you're doing
is delaying the process.

1138
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:26,980
Sneaking behind our backs,

1139
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:29,649
fucking anything with a
pair of tits and three holes,

1140
00:56:29,649 --> 00:56:32,485
eventually making us look like
idiots, breaking our spirits.

1141
00:56:32,485 --> 00:56:35,154
That is not
compassionate, David.

1142
00:56:35,154 --> 00:56:37,114
That is fucking evil.

1143
00:56:37,114 --> 00:56:38,490
Evil?

1144
00:56:38,490 --> 00:56:40,492
Yeah, evil.

1145
00:56:40,492 --> 00:56:41,827
And the sad thing is

1146
00:56:41,827 --> 00:56:44,371
you can't even comprehend
why it's evil

1147
00:56:44,371 --> 00:56:47,123
because you've never
had to feel anything.

1148
00:56:48,374 --> 00:56:52,420
It must be so nice to be
as numb to the world as you,

1149
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:54,880
protected and sheltered
by your own shallowness.

1150
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:58,258
So much so that you don't
even realize what you're doing

1151
00:56:58,258 --> 00:57:00,427
is downright wrong.

1152
00:57:03,638 --> 00:57:04,848
You done?

1153
00:57:08,309 --> 00:57:10,394
Why are you such an asshole?

1154
00:57:10,394 --> 00:57:11,896
I don't know.

1155
00:57:11,896 --> 00:57:14,231
It's a gift.

1156
00:57:14,231 --> 00:57:15,899
No, it's just sad.

1157
00:57:18,068 --> 00:57:21,071
I mean, I can't expect
you to understand

1158
00:57:21,071 --> 00:57:22,030
what it feels like
to be heartbroken.

1159
00:57:22,030 --> 00:57:23,907
You wanna know why?

1160
00:57:23,907 --> 00:57:25,033
Why?

1161
00:57:26,576 --> 00:57:28,036
'Cause you don't
have a heart.

1162
00:57:37,753 --> 00:57:40,213
By the way, I lied.

1163
00:57:40,213 --> 00:57:43,383
It is small.

1164
00:57:43,383 --> 00:57:45,802
<i># And still I rise #</i>

1165
00:57:45,802 --> 00:57:49,764
<i># And still I rise #</i>

1166
00:57:49,764 --> 00:57:52,308
<i># Like the sun I'll shine #</i>

1167
00:57:52,308 --> 00:57:55,185
<i># Oh, and still I rise... #</i>

1168
00:58:26,714 --> 00:58:28,549
Oh, yeah.

1169
00:58:44,189 --> 00:58:47,191
Uh...

1170
00:58:47,191 --> 00:58:50,403
What's your name again?

1171
00:58:50,403 --> 00:58:51,445
Alanna.

1172
00:58:51,445 --> 00:58:52,530
Ah.

1173
00:58:54,406 --> 00:58:56,241
What was yours?

1174
00:58:56,241 --> 00:58:57,451
Uh, Marco.

1175
00:58:57,451 --> 00:58:58,577
Oh.

1176
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:01,830
It's nice
to meet you again.

1177
00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:03,290
Yes.

1178
00:59:07,168 --> 00:59:09,587
You, too.
R-Really.

1179
00:59:12,298 --> 00:59:15,092
Where, uh--
Where are you from?

1180
00:59:16,176 --> 00:59:18,053
Arkansas.
Huh?

1181
00:59:18,053 --> 00:59:21,098
This little town
outside of Little Rock.

1182
00:59:21,098 --> 00:59:24,184
Um...Little Rock?

1183
00:59:24,184 --> 00:59:27,353
Yeah, it's one of the
bigger cities in Arkansas.

1184
00:59:27,353 --> 00:59:29,647
Oh.

1185
00:59:29,647 --> 00:59:32,650
No, no,
never heard of it.

1186
00:59:33,651 --> 00:59:36,487
Where are you from,
Mexico or something?

1187
00:59:36,487 --> 00:59:39,156
Uh, well, I'm Spanish,
and, uh...

1188
00:59:39,156 --> 00:59:41,408
I'm from Madrid.

1189
00:59:41,408 --> 00:59:44,661
Is-- What part
of Mexico is that in?

1190
00:59:44,661 --> 00:59:47,163
Oh, no, it's--
it's in Spain.

1191
00:59:49,540 --> 00:59:52,668
I know, but isn't that
in Mexico?

1192
00:59:52,668 --> 00:59:56,255
No, it's in Spain.

1193
00:59:56,255 --> 00:59:58,549
It's a country?

1194
00:59:58,549 --> 01:00:00,008
In Europe?

1195
01:00:00,008 --> 01:00:03,470
Oh! Okay, like,
by England.

1196
01:00:03,470 --> 01:00:05,638
Y-Yeah, kind of.

1197
01:00:14,647 --> 01:00:18,484
What, um-- What language
do they speak there?

1198
01:00:18,484 --> 01:00:20,152
Spanish.

1199
01:00:22,070 --> 01:00:24,155
I know, but isn't that
what they speak in, um--

1200
01:00:24,155 --> 01:00:27,575
in, uh...Mexico?

1201
01:00:27,575 --> 01:00:28,826
Yes, but the language--

1202
01:00:28,826 --> 01:00:31,662
uh, the language
originated in Spain.

1203
01:00:33,956 --> 01:00:37,084
Are you sure?

1204
01:00:37,084 --> 01:00:39,002
Yes, I'm positive.

1205
01:00:41,713 --> 01:00:43,256
Yes. Positive.

1206
01:00:43,256 --> 01:00:46,217
Hmm. See, 'cause
I have a...

1207
01:00:46,217 --> 01:00:47,594
I have
a Mexican friend,

1208
01:00:47,594 --> 01:00:49,387
and he speaks
Spanish.

1209
01:00:58,562 --> 01:01:01,731
So is tonight your first
night at the Spider Club?

1210
01:01:01,731 --> 01:01:05,110
No. No, I've been there
quite a bit.

1211
01:01:05,110 --> 01:01:08,571
You?
No, I'm there all the time.

1212
01:01:08,571 --> 01:01:11,949
I'm surprised I've
never seen you there.

1213
01:01:11,949 --> 01:01:13,909
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

1214
01:01:23,585 --> 01:01:27,589
What's your
favorite, uh...

1215
01:01:27,589 --> 01:01:29,465
color?

1216
01:01:29,465 --> 01:01:30,925
My favorite color.

1217
01:01:30,925 --> 01:01:33,844
Um, I don't know.
Gray, I guess.

1218
01:01:33,844 --> 01:01:36,847
Oh, no, see,
gray's not a color.

1219
01:01:36,847 --> 01:01:39,433
Sure it is.

1220
01:01:39,433 --> 01:01:42,102
I have a gray
sweater.

1221
01:01:42,102 --> 01:01:42,811
Oh.

1222
01:01:44,979 --> 01:01:46,523
So what do you do?

1223
01:01:46,523 --> 01:01:47,190
I'm an actor.

1224
01:01:47,190 --> 01:01:48,691
Really?

1225
01:01:48,691 --> 01:01:51,068
Yeah, well,
an aspiring actor.

1226
01:01:51,068 --> 01:01:53,654
Would I have seen you
in anything?

1227
01:01:53,654 --> 01:01:56,657
Probably not, no.
Oh.

1228
01:01:56,657 --> 01:02:00,619
<i>Oh-- Well, actually,
I was Cholo #3</i>

1229
01:02:00,619 --> 01:02:02,370
<i>in an episodio
of Oz one time.</i>

1230
01:02:02,370 --> 01:02:04,831
Oh, cool!
Yeah.

1231
01:02:04,831 --> 01:02:07,000
Yeah, my agent,
he says that, uh--

1232
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,459
He says that things
are going to be

1233
01:02:08,459 --> 01:02:09,710
picking up for me
very soon.

1234
01:02:09,710 --> 01:02:10,753
Really?

1235
01:02:10,753 --> 01:02:13,339
Well, he says I have
a unique quality

1236
01:02:13,339 --> 01:02:15,924
that sets me apart
from the pack.

1237
01:02:15,924 --> 01:02:16,925
Hmm.

1238
01:02:16,925 --> 01:02:18,343
It's only a matter
of time, he says,

1239
01:02:18,343 --> 01:02:20,595
before I get
my big break.

1240
01:02:20,595 --> 01:02:22,305
Cool.

1241
01:02:22,305 --> 01:02:24,933
He describes me
as the next, uh...

1242
01:02:24,933 --> 01:02:26,267
the next
Antonio Banderas.

1243
01:02:26,267 --> 01:02:27,602
Oh, really?
Yeah.

1244
01:02:27,602 --> 01:02:29,103
I love that guy.

1245
01:02:29,103 --> 01:02:32,189
<i>I love Fantasy Island.</i>

1246
01:02:32,189 --> 01:02:34,275
Oh, so good.
Yeah.

1247
01:02:36,068 --> 01:02:37,778
What do you do?

1248
01:02:37,820 --> 01:02:39,571
I'm a model.

1249
01:02:39,571 --> 01:02:41,198
See, I would have
guessed that.

1250
01:02:41,198 --> 01:02:43,700
Really?

1251
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:45,910
You look like a model.

1252
01:02:45,910 --> 01:02:48,037
Thanks.
Mm-hmm.

1253
01:02:48,037 --> 01:02:49,664
What kind of modeling
do you do?

1254
01:02:49,705 --> 01:02:52,750
Um...

1255
01:02:52,750 --> 01:02:54,460
Mostly print.
Mm-hmm.

1256
01:02:54,460 --> 01:02:57,880
Adult stuff,
you know.

1257
01:02:57,880 --> 01:02:59,881
Really?
Yeah.

1258
01:02:59,881 --> 01:03:02,175
Just for now,
till I can find

1259
01:03:02,175 --> 01:03:03,969
something better to do.

1260
01:03:03,969 --> 01:03:06,387
Oh.
It's cool.

1261
01:03:10,057 --> 01:03:12,518
Would I have seen--
seen you in something?

1262
01:03:12,518 --> 01:03:16,021
<i>Maybe. Do you ever
pick up the L.A. Express?</i>

1263
01:03:16,021 --> 01:03:17,898
That's, uh--

1264
01:03:17,898 --> 01:03:20,067
That's the paper that
advertises for hookers.

1265
01:03:20,067 --> 01:03:21,943
Uh...yeah.

1266
01:03:21,943 --> 01:03:23,153
Call-- Call girls
or something?

1267
01:03:23,153 --> 01:03:24,612
They're escorts.

1268
01:03:24,612 --> 01:03:25,405
S-Sorry.
Sorry.

1269
01:03:26,948 --> 01:03:29,242
Actually, yeah.
I've seen it--

1270
01:03:29,242 --> 01:03:31,327
I've seen it
a couple of times.

1271
01:03:37,791 --> 01:03:41,336
I had--
I had this--

1272
01:03:41,336 --> 01:03:43,672
You are not a...

1273
01:03:43,672 --> 01:03:45,507
you're not a professional,
though, are you?

1274
01:03:45,507 --> 01:03:47,342
Yeah!
What?

1275
01:03:47,342 --> 01:03:50,511
Yeah, I'm an escort
from time to time.

1276
01:03:50,511 --> 01:03:51,971
Why didn't you say something?

1277
01:03:51,971 --> 01:03:55,182
'Cause you just
asked me right now.

1278
01:03:55,182 --> 01:03:58,143
I mean, I just fucking
went down on you.

1279
01:03:58,143 --> 01:04:00,103
Jesus Christ, don't you
think that's something

1280
01:04:00,103 --> 01:04:01,563
you should tell someone
before you--

1281
01:04:01,563 --> 01:04:03,148
you sleep with them?

1282
01:04:03,148 --> 01:04:05,817
No.

1283
01:04:05,817 --> 01:04:08,194
You didn't tell me what you
did before you slept with me.

1284
01:04:08,194 --> 01:04:09,320
That's different, okay?

1285
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:11,447
I-I don't sleep with
random people for money.

1286
01:04:13,032 --> 01:04:15,826
You're not upset,
are you?

1287
01:04:15,826 --> 01:04:18,620
A little bit.

1288
01:04:19,705 --> 01:04:20,831
Oh, jeez.

1289
01:04:20,831 --> 01:04:23,083
You don't have
something, do you?

1290
01:04:23,083 --> 01:04:24,626
Like what?

1291
01:04:24,626 --> 01:04:26,127
Like a fucking
disease or something.

1292
01:04:26,127 --> 01:04:27,962
No.

1293
01:04:27,962 --> 01:04:31,215
No way. I make all
the guys wear condoms.

1294
01:04:31,257 --> 01:04:32,258
It's my number one rule.

1295
01:04:35,678 --> 01:04:37,054
Oh, Jesus.

1296
01:04:37,054 --> 01:04:39,598
My fucking dong is going
to mush up and fall off.

1297
01:04:39,598 --> 01:04:41,683
Come on,
don't be angry.

1298
01:04:41,683 --> 01:04:43,643
What were you doing
at the club tonight?

1299
01:04:43,643 --> 01:04:47,230
Shouldn't you be out
working or something?

1300
01:04:47,230 --> 01:04:49,482
Silly. Escorts
like to party, too.

1301
01:04:49,482 --> 01:04:52,360
Besides, it's a good place
to pick up work.

1302
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:54,820
Oh, my God.

1303
01:04:54,820 --> 01:04:56,739
You don't expect me
to pay for this, do you?

1304
01:04:56,739 --> 01:04:59,324
No. I liked it.

1305
01:05:02,661 --> 01:05:04,954
I like sex just like
the next person, you know?

1306
01:05:04,954 --> 01:05:06,998
That's why I do
what I do.

1307
01:05:06,998 --> 01:05:10,918
Can we not-- Let's not
talk about it, okay?

1308
01:05:10,918 --> 01:05:12,670
Just be careful,
yeah?

1309
01:05:12,670 --> 01:05:15,631
I don't know why you get
so uncomfortable about it.

1310
01:05:15,631 --> 01:05:17,466
It's kinda cute.

1311
01:05:17,466 --> 01:05:19,009
And you're
for real, huh?

1312
01:05:19,009 --> 01:05:21,928
Yeah, I mean, it's not like I
sleep with that many more men

1313
01:05:21,928 --> 01:05:23,763
than every other
stupid girl at the club.

1314
01:05:23,763 --> 01:05:26,474
I'm just smart enough
to get paid for it.

1315
01:05:26,474 --> 01:05:27,392
But you're selling
yourself.

1316
01:05:27,392 --> 01:05:29,394
You're ashamed, no?

1317
01:05:29,394 --> 01:05:32,480
No. Why should I be?

1318
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:35,357
I like what I do, and until
something more promising comes along,

1319
01:05:35,357 --> 01:05:38,068
then I'm happy
getting paid to have sex.

1320
01:05:38,068 --> 01:05:40,737
I like to do
the boopsy.

1321
01:05:40,737 --> 01:05:43,031
Were you abused
as a child or something?

1322
01:05:43,031 --> 01:05:44,991
No!

1323
01:05:46,868 --> 01:05:48,911
How-- How long have you
been doing this?

1324
01:05:48,911 --> 01:05:50,955
Um--
Right here.

1325
01:05:50,955 --> 01:05:53,290
Since I moved here.

1326
01:05:53,290 --> 01:05:55,960
I was waiting tables,
and this guy made me an offer.

1327
01:05:57,920 --> 01:05:59,087
And was he serious?

1328
01:05:59,129 --> 01:06:00,922
Mm-hmm.

1329
01:06:00,922 --> 01:06:03,967
Yep. He offered me a thousand
bucks to come home with him.

1330
01:06:03,967 --> 01:06:06,511
Oh, Jesus.
A thousand bucks.

1331
01:06:06,511 --> 01:06:09,514
So I did it.
Oh, he was so cute.

1332
01:06:09,514 --> 01:06:10,973
And he was nice.

1333
01:06:10,973 --> 01:06:13,100
I would have went home with him
for free if he would have asked,

1334
01:06:13,100 --> 01:06:15,352
but I figured I'd make me
some money, you know?

1335
01:06:15,352 --> 01:06:17,521
Hmm.

1336
01:06:17,521 --> 01:06:20,023
After that, you know,
I told my friend,

1337
01:06:20,023 --> 01:06:21,691
and we both decided
to quit waiting tables

1338
01:06:21,691 --> 01:06:23,568
and do it for a living.

1339
01:06:23,568 --> 01:06:26,029
Not too bad.
It's honest work.

1340
01:06:26,029 --> 01:06:28,197
I offer a service
and I get my rocks off

1341
01:06:28,197 --> 01:06:31,284
in the meantime, so it
works out for everyone.

1342
01:06:31,284 --> 01:06:32,910
Ooh!

1343
01:06:32,910 --> 01:06:33,828
I'm home, honey!

1344
01:06:37,206 --> 01:06:37,915
Jesus.

1345
01:06:41,835 --> 01:06:43,878
Uh, don't you come across
the scumbags, huh?

1346
01:06:43,878 --> 01:06:47,382
Sometimes, but...

1347
01:06:47,382 --> 01:06:49,550
that's where this
comes in.

1348
01:06:49,550 --> 01:06:51,552
Oh, Jesus!
Okay.

1349
01:06:51,552 --> 01:06:53,971
What, don't they have
guns in Mexico?

1350
01:06:53,971 --> 01:06:55,639
Mexico, they're all
about the guns,

1351
01:06:55,639 --> 01:06:56,682
but in Spain, no.

1352
01:06:56,682 --> 01:06:59,142
Okay...be careful
with that, huh?

1353
01:06:59,142 --> 01:07:01,728
Don't be scared.
I know how to handle a gun.

1354
01:07:01,728 --> 01:07:03,939
I've been shooting
since I was six.

1355
01:07:03,939 --> 01:07:06,316
Okay, uh...

1356
01:07:06,316 --> 01:07:08,067
Put it-- Put it
in the bag.

1357
01:07:08,067 --> 01:07:10,778
Zip, zip, zip, zip,
zip it in the bag, okay?

1358
01:07:10,778 --> 01:07:11,779
Put it away.

1359
01:07:13,364 --> 01:07:15,574
Aw, you're scared.

1360
01:07:15,574 --> 01:07:17,242
Anyway, I try not
to worry too much,

1361
01:07:17,242 --> 01:07:18,952
'cause I'm
a pretty, uh--

1362
01:07:18,952 --> 01:07:23,123
I'm a pretty good judge
of character, you know?

1363
01:07:23,123 --> 01:07:24,833
Hey!

1364
01:07:24,833 --> 01:07:27,710
I trusted you,
didn't I?

1365
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:29,629
Ay.

1366
01:07:29,629 --> 01:07:31,631
Anyhoo,

1367
01:07:31,631 --> 01:07:35,384
I don't worry
too much.

1368
01:07:35,384 --> 01:07:36,844
I do what
I want to do,

1369
01:07:36,844 --> 01:07:39,638
and if I'm not
feeling it, I don't.

1370
01:07:39,638 --> 01:07:41,431
Oy.

1371
01:07:41,431 --> 01:07:43,266
Are you all right?

1372
01:07:43,266 --> 01:07:46,769
Oy, I--
I don't know.

1373
01:07:46,769 --> 01:07:49,105
Hey, look, don't let it
bother you, okay?

1374
01:07:49,105 --> 01:07:50,773
I promise, I am clean.

1375
01:07:50,773 --> 01:07:53,275
I use protection.

1376
01:07:53,275 --> 01:07:55,069
Look, I'm just
a normal person like you

1377
01:07:55,069 --> 01:07:56,904
except for I get
paid to fuck.

1378
01:07:56,904 --> 01:07:58,280
Okay, okay.

1379
01:07:58,280 --> 01:08:00,073
Could you please stop
saying that, yes?

1380
01:08:00,073 --> 01:08:02,701
What are you doing
in there?

1381
01:08:02,701 --> 01:08:05,203
I-- I'm cleaning up.

1382
01:08:05,203 --> 01:08:06,788
Okay.

1383
01:08:06,788 --> 01:08:08,748
Oy.

1384
01:08:14,003 --> 01:08:16,588
How-- How old were you
when you first had the sex?

1385
01:08:18,924 --> 01:08:20,634
12.

1386
01:08:23,345 --> 01:08:24,971
Yes-- Yes, 12.
Okay.

1387
01:08:24,971 --> 01:08:26,222
Um...

1388
01:08:26,222 --> 01:08:29,142
12?
Yeah, 12.

1389
01:08:29,142 --> 01:08:31,394
Okay.
With-- With who?

1390
01:08:31,394 --> 01:08:34,063
Uh, my Uncle Danny.

1391
01:08:34,063 --> 01:08:35,981
You fucked with
your Uncle Danny?

1392
01:08:35,981 --> 01:08:38,150
Yeah, but I thought
it was my cousin.

1393
01:08:38,150 --> 01:08:41,528
Oh-- Oh, Jesus.

1394
01:08:41,528 --> 01:08:43,571
What can I say?
It was dark in my room.

1395
01:08:43,571 --> 01:08:46,824
Okay, but you thought
it was your cousin.

1396
01:08:46,824 --> 01:08:47,909
Yeah, well,
me and my cousin,

1397
01:08:47,909 --> 01:08:50,328
we've always
fooled around.

1398
01:08:50,328 --> 01:08:54,039
Why--
I told you I was from Arkansas.

1399
01:08:54,039 --> 01:08:56,500
What is that
supposed to mean?

1400
01:08:56,500 --> 01:08:59,419
It's just it's not that
uncommon of a thing, that's all.

1401
01:08:59,419 --> 01:09:00,504
At least
it wasn't my dad.

1402
01:09:01,713 --> 01:09:03,340
What the fu--
Oh, God.

1403
01:09:03,340 --> 01:09:05,008
This is-- This is
too much for me.

1404
01:09:05,008 --> 01:09:07,885
Calm down.
It was a long time ago.

1405
01:09:07,885 --> 01:09:09,887
No, no, everything.

1406
01:09:09,887 --> 01:09:12,890
First, you're a girl who's
laying in bed next to me,

1407
01:09:12,890 --> 01:09:15,476
and then you're an escort
who's laying in bed next to me.

1408
01:09:15,476 --> 01:09:17,728
Now you're an escort
who fucked her uncle

1409
01:09:17,728 --> 01:09:18,979
who she thought
was her cousin

1410
01:09:18,979 --> 01:09:20,439
is laying in bed
next to me!

1411
01:09:20,439 --> 01:09:22,065
This is too
fucked for me!

1412
01:09:22,065 --> 01:09:22,691
Relax.

1413
01:09:24,275 --> 01:09:25,735
Relax.

1414
01:09:25,777 --> 01:09:27,654
What is it? Relax?
Huh, relax?

1415
01:09:27,654 --> 01:09:28,738
You want me to relax?

1416
01:09:28,738 --> 01:09:30,072
How the fuck am I
supposed to relax?

1417
01:09:30,072 --> 01:09:31,574
I don't even know
who the fuck you are,

1418
01:09:31,574 --> 01:09:35,160
and I just put my dick inside
you for... over an hour.

1419
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:36,620
Well, maybe you
should think twice

1420
01:09:36,620 --> 01:09:38,121
before you take
a stranger home

1421
01:09:38,121 --> 01:09:39,456
and have sex with her.

1422
01:09:39,456 --> 01:09:41,041
You know, look at you.

1423
01:09:41,041 --> 01:09:44,044
You don't even realize how incredibly
fucked the situation is, huh?

1424
01:09:44,044 --> 01:09:45,962
Why don't you just relax?
You'll get over it.

1425
01:09:45,962 --> 01:09:50,508
No. No, I will not
get over it, okay?

1426
01:09:50,508 --> 01:09:55,054
Having sex with an escort
is not something I get over.

1427
01:09:55,054 --> 01:09:58,515
I have never paid
for the sex in my life.

1428
01:09:58,515 --> 01:10:01,101
I already said this one
was on the house.

1429
01:10:01,101 --> 01:10:03,853
You don't get it,
do you, huh?

1430
01:10:03,853 --> 01:10:05,814
Come on.

1431
01:10:05,814 --> 01:10:07,732
Relax.
Didn't we have fun?

1432
01:10:07,732 --> 01:10:09,233
I thought we were
having fun.

1433
01:10:09,233 --> 01:10:11,652
Did you really
fuck your uncle?

1434
01:10:11,652 --> 01:10:14,697
Yes, but I told you
I thought it was my cousin.

1435
01:10:14,697 --> 01:10:15,948
Oh, God!
Why, why--

1436
01:10:15,948 --> 01:10:17,616
Why do you keep
saying that

1437
01:10:17,616 --> 01:10:19,284
like it's supposed to
make me feel better, huh?

1438
01:10:19,284 --> 01:10:21,119
Well, doesn't it?

1439
01:10:21,119 --> 01:10:23,872
I mean, what if I fucked
my uncle knowingly?

1440
01:10:23,872 --> 01:10:26,040
Now that's gross.

1441
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:27,625
You are twisted,
you know that?

1442
01:10:27,625 --> 01:10:31,754
No, I'm not twisted.
I'm honest, okay?

1443
01:10:31,754 --> 01:10:34,089
I mean, most girls
would have lied.

1444
01:10:34,089 --> 01:10:36,759
If you had asked them what they did
for a living, they would have lied.

1445
01:10:36,759 --> 01:10:38,385
They would have said
they were a runway model

1446
01:10:38,385 --> 01:10:40,929
for Gucci or Dolce
or some bullshit.

1447
01:10:40,929 --> 01:10:43,598
I'm not ashamed
of what I am, okay?

1448
01:10:43,598 --> 01:10:45,308
Just 'cause you got
your hang-ups,

1449
01:10:45,308 --> 01:10:47,518
don't take them out
on me, Buster Brown.

1450
01:10:47,518 --> 01:10:50,938
Buster Brown?

1451
01:10:50,938 --> 01:10:53,607
Buster?
What-- What...

1452
01:10:53,607 --> 01:10:54,608
What is this Buster--

1453
01:10:54,650 --> 01:10:56,110
You are
the craziest person

1454
01:10:56,110 --> 01:10:58,403
I've ever met
in my life, you know?

1455
01:11:01,323 --> 01:11:03,617
You got another
round in you?

1456
01:11:03,658 --> 01:11:06,119
Another round?

1457
01:11:08,121 --> 01:11:10,665
What-- What was that?
What was that?

1458
01:11:10,665 --> 01:11:11,958
You got another
round in you?

1459
01:11:11,958 --> 01:11:13,417
Another round, huh?

1460
01:11:13,417 --> 01:11:15,044
Are you completely
oblivious

1461
01:11:15,044 --> 01:11:17,671
to everything that's just
taken place here, huh?

1462
01:11:20,048 --> 01:11:21,049
What is this?

1463
01:11:21,049 --> 01:11:23,718
What the fuck
is so funny, huh?

1464
01:11:23,718 --> 01:11:24,969
What is so--
What is so funny?

1465
01:11:24,969 --> 01:11:28,097
What--

1466
01:11:28,097 --> 01:11:29,390
You don't
laugh at me!

1467
01:11:29,390 --> 01:11:30,391
You come into my house--
Just relax!

1468
01:11:30,391 --> 01:11:32,226
I was just
fucking with you.

1469
01:11:34,311 --> 01:11:35,938
What?

1470
01:11:35,938 --> 01:11:37,356
I was fucking with you.

1471
01:11:37,356 --> 01:11:39,149
I'm not an fucking escort.

1472
01:11:39,149 --> 01:11:41,318
What?
What is this?

1473
01:11:41,318 --> 01:11:42,152
You're-- You're not
an escort?

1474
01:11:42,152 --> 01:11:43,945
No.

1475
01:11:43,945 --> 01:11:46,990
Are you serious?
Yeah!

1476
01:11:46,990 --> 01:11:51,118
You should have seen your face
when I said I fucked my uncle!

1477
01:11:55,414 --> 01:11:59,167
Your-- Your eyes,
like, bugged out.

1478
01:11:59,167 --> 01:12:00,877
Okay, wait, wait,
All of this, this is--

1479
01:12:00,877 --> 01:12:03,296
It was bullshit.

1480
01:12:03,296 --> 01:12:04,673
It was
complete bullshit.

1481
01:12:04,673 --> 01:12:06,466
The gun.
What about the gun?

1482
01:12:06,466 --> 01:12:08,968
What about the gun?

1483
01:12:08,968 --> 01:12:10,386
This is--

1484
01:12:12,263 --> 01:12:13,931
It's a lighter.

1485
01:12:13,931 --> 01:12:16,141
You--
It's a fucking lighter.

1486
01:12:16,141 --> 01:12:17,935
You're pulling-- You're
pulling my chain, eh?

1487
01:12:17,935 --> 01:12:19,895
No, I'm serious.
Look.

1488
01:12:27,068 --> 01:12:28,319
Okay, this--

1489
01:12:28,319 --> 01:12:30,404
I mean, it's bad--
it's bad enough

1490
01:12:30,404 --> 01:12:32,323
that you're being
a hooker,

1491
01:12:32,323 --> 01:12:34,283
but the whole "fucking
your uncle," that's--

1492
01:12:34,283 --> 01:12:35,576
I know.
It's so fucked.

1493
01:12:35,576 --> 01:12:37,369
That's just fucking
disturbing.

1494
01:12:37,369 --> 01:12:38,871
This is a--
This is a lighter?

1495
01:12:38,871 --> 01:12:40,038
You're not
an escort, huh?

1496
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:41,748
No. But I mean,
come on,

1497
01:12:41,748 --> 01:12:43,875
would it have all
really mattered, though?

1498
01:12:43,917 --> 01:12:44,667
I mean...

1499
01:12:44,667 --> 01:12:47,837
Yeah, I think--
Yes, I...

1500
01:12:49,088 --> 01:12:50,715
So...

1501
01:12:50,756 --> 01:12:53,426
what-- what do you
really do, huh?

1502
01:12:56,929 --> 01:12:58,430
I'm an actress.

1503
01:13:02,267 --> 01:13:04,352
