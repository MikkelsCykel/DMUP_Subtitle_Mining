1
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,900
A soldier does not speak...

2
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,800
...until spoken to by a superior officer.

3
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
A soldier shows no mercy.

4
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,000
Mercy is weakness.

5
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,000
Weakness is death.

6
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,600
The Forces are his family.

7
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,700
He is most happy...

8
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,700
...when following orders.

9
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,100
A soldier lives to kill.

10
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,600
A soldier needs no friend or family.

11
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,600
War is his friend.

12
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,900
The Forces are his family.

13
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,600
Sir, Colonel Mekum has
his new batch unpacked.

14
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,900
l think he wants to show them off.

15
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,100
Well....

16
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,600
-They're pretty.
-What's so hot about them?

17
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,900
They're very much improved, Captain.

18
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,300
Colonel Mekum from HQ.
He's their commanding officer.

19
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,200
Sir.

20
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,700
'"lmproved.'" How?

21
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,800
ln every way possible.

22
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,000
You see, your old ones,
they're selected at birth.

23
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,700
With my new ones,
we're talking recombination.

24
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:39,400
They're practically manufactured,
using DNA profiles...

25
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,500
...and some manipulation.

26
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,700
More endurance, quicker responses...

27
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,000
...better hand-eye...

28
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
...improved technical training.

29
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
lt's a whole different standard.

30
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,600
My daddy was in maintenance...

31
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,600
...and he had a saying:

32
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,900
'"lf it ain't broke, don't fix it.'"

33
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,100
'"Maintenance.'"

34
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,400
l'm afraid l don't get your point.

35
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,100
The veterans you see...

36
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:09,800
...standing before you here
have been through all kinds of heavy shit.

37
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,700
They've always got the job done.

38
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:15,400
Your new soldiers, these hotshots,
how much action have they seen?

39
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,500
And are they battle-tested?

40
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,200
How about a few tests,
just to get you on board?

41
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,600
Make you a believer.

42
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,000
Ninety-nine percent. That's...

43
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,800
...very good.

44
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,200
Seen enough, Captain?

45
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,000
What about endurance?

46
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,700
Caine 607, forward.

47
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,200
Sir!

48
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,500
Fifteen miles, 607, on the run.

49
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,300
You've got 60 minutes.

50
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,200
Go.

51
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,000
My man left exactly...

52
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,000
...20 minutes after yours.

53
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,700
Make a note of that.

54
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,900
Age is a factor. But the real factor
is the training program.

55
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,900
Especially the psychological.

56
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,700
The mind controls the body, after all.

57
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,700
And we're doing such wonderful things
with the mind.

58
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,400
Sir!

59
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,000
At ease, Soldier.

60
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,400
What is the price of all that speed?

61
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,200
ls your soldier tired?

62
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,500
'"Tired?'"

63
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,100
Todd ran the pace
he's been taught to run...

64
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,000
...and he's still strong.

65
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,400
Send him up the chain, Rube.

66
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,500
Soldier! Up the chain!

67
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:25,900
Sir!

68
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,700
607, on the double, up the chain.

69
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,600
Sir!

70
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,600
What about spirit?

71
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,000
l believe you mean AQ, Captain.
Aggressive qualities.

72
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,900
Much higher.

73
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,200
Much better.

74
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,100
What if they fought?

75
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,200
You mean up there?

76
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,600
Go ahead, Rube.

77
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,800
Tell Todd to take him.

78
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,800
No.

79
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,600
'"No?'"

80
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,200
Not fair.

81
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,000
No contest.

82
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,300
Send two more of your old ones up.

83
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,400
Romero, Goines, up the chain!

84
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,000
Get him, men!

85
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,700
Get down here.

86
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,600
Get down here!

87
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,200
Get your ass down here on the double!

88
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,600
Come on, double up! Down, down!

89
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,600
Sir!

90
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,800
Look at you.

91
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:09,800
Do you know how much it cost
to breed you, you big moron?

92
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,800
To train you?

93
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,700
To feed you?

94
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,300
What good is this man now?

95
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,100
He's got no depth perception!

96
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,100
All he can do is walk, point,
and take the first hit!

97
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,100
-What about the bodies?
-Waste disposal.

98
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,900
Fall in.

99
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,000
Sir!

100
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,600
Todd was our best man.

101
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,000
You still don't get it, do you?

102
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,600
Your men...

103
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,800
...are obsolete.

104
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,100
You'll write this up as a training accident...

105
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:21,000
...and you'll make sure these bodies
get dumped a long way from here.

106
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,700
We don't want any unnecessary questions.

107
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,300
Someone, please...

108
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,400
...let us know what's going on!

109
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,800
Hawkins!

110
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,600
Give us something! Anything!

111
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,200
Quiet, please!

112
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,000
Quiet!

113
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,800
How many of them are there?

114
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,300
There is one man...

115
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,600
...unarmed.

116
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,000
How could there only be one?
How could he get here?

117
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,900
He was unconscious when we found him.

118
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,500
We couldn't ask him anything.

119
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,900
Hang on. Jimmy's back!

120
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,400
There's nothing out there.

121
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,400
l couldn't see nobody.

122
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,200
Couldn't see no vehicles, no ship, nothing.

123
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,600
Plus the wind's up again real strong.

124
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,200
Everybody, calm down.

125
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,800
We have an injured man among us.

126
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,300
We all want to do the decent thing.

127
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,300
The decent thing is to help him.

128
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:48,000
Sandra, Mace's wife,
is looking after him now.

129
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,100
Now, l'd like a vote of support
from all of you.

130
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,200
You keep an eye on him, Mace.

131
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,600
Watch him.

132
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,400
There are words on his shoulder.

133
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,900
'"Tannhauser Gate...

134
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,300
'"...Argentine Sector...

135
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,900
'"...Shanghai 2012.'"

136
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,700
Sandra, the Tannhauser Gate was a battle.

137
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,800
He's a soldier.

138
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,600
Where's Nathan?

139
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,200
Tiger!

140
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,800
Nathan, there's another tiger.

141
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,600
Help, help, help!

142
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,700
We're sorry if we woke you.

143
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,800
Just playing with the boy.

144
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:18,700
Sergeant...

145
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,600
...l made something for you.

146
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,000
lt's to help you walk, you see?

147
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,900
lsn't it? Like this.

148
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,700
See?

149
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,000
Here you go.

150
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:22,500
l don't see how you cannot remember
how you got here, Sergeant.

151
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:27,300
You're not a deserter, are you, Sergeant?

152
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,100
No, sir.

153
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,800
Why aren't you with your unit?

154
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,900
Come on, Slade, let the man eat.

155
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,100
lt's not an unreasonable question.

156
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,400
How about it, Sergeant?

157
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,400
l was replaced.

158
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,600
'"Replaced?'"

159
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,600
By a better soldier, sir.

160
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:16,600
When we left Earth 12 years ago,
we never thought we'd end up here.

161
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,600
When we crashed, a lot of people died.

162
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:24,300
A few years later, when the dumpers
started coming and dropping stuff...

163
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:28,000
...people tried to get their attention
with fires and explosions.

164
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,800
But it didn't work.

165
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
They must be unmanned or...

166
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,100
...maybe they just don't care.

167
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:39,400
So, we had to forget about a better life
on the Trinity Moons.

168
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,300
One good thing though:

169
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,800
Nobody bothers us.

170
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,600
Who'd fight for a godforsaken place
like this?

171
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,400
But...

172
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,200
...l guess you like the fighting.

173
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,800
You must.

174
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,000
You're...

175
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,400
...a soldier.

176
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,000
The biannual security sweep.

177
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,500
We'll be patrolling the Arcadia system.

178
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:26,400
We're going to set up
unmanned monitoring stations here...

179
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,200
...here, here, here.

180
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:31,300
Now, we send the new soldiers out
on patrol.

181
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,700
Routine stuff as you say, Captain,
but good experience and...

182
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,700
...l'll have a chance to see them
in a non-training environment.

183
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,000
You're coming?

184
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,100
Yes, Captain.

185
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,300
l want to observe these men at close hand.

186
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,200
Well, what about opposition?

187
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,800
lt's all deserted.
We're just confirming that.

188
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,900
But say we do encounter activity.

189
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:55,200
Miners, refugees of some sort?

190
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,800
Well, we won't.

191
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,400
lf so, they'll be officially classifiable
as hostiles.

192
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,300
Just by being there?

193
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:06,100
We don't want paperwork,
and we certainly don't want passengers.

194
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,200
Understood?

195
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,600
You have to watch out for those.

196
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,400
They probably wouldn't kill someone
your size.

197
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:42,200
But someone smaller, like me...

198
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,400
...or Nathan....

199
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,200
He was bitten once...

200
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,900
...and he almost died.

201
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,900
He was sick for a long time.

202
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,300
That's why he can't speak.

203
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,600
Here.

204
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,800
You try one.

205
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,500
Here.

206
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,900
Everything we own, Sergeant,
everything in the entire village...

207
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:29,600
...we've had to salvage from out here.

208
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,100
-You're all set, Jimmy.
-Back in a minute.

209
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,700
Whatever looks useful,
if we can get a chain to it...

210
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,600
...we're going to go for it.

211
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,400
You hear that?

212
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,700
That means she's really close.

213
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,200
She's going to blow!

214
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,600
On my way!

215
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,400
Line up!

216
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,300
Come on, Jimmy!

217
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,300
Jimmy, come on!

218
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,900
Come on!

219
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,400
Hurry up! Let's go!

220
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,000
-Mace!
-Give me your hand!

221
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,600
-Too strong!
-Stretch!

222
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,200
Reach, Jimmy!

223
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,300
l can't reach!

224
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,500
Help!

225
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:37,600
Help!

226
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,000
Pull!

227
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,800
Mace! Help!

228
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:55,200
Pull!

229
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,400
All right, we got him!

230
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,500
You were almost bacon on that one.

231
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,700
Thank you.

232
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,000
They're dumpers.

233
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:12,000
They come every 20 or 30 days.

234
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,200
Sergeant, the gun. Please.

235
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,000
Thanks, partner!

236
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,300
Them no-goods would've let me
blow away.

237
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,200
Sergeant Todd...

238
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,100
...what's it like?

239
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,600
What's it like being a soldier?

240
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,300
What do you think about?

241
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,600
You must think about something.

242
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,600
What about feelings, then?

243
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,400
You must feel something.

244
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,200
Fear.

245
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,000
'"Fear?'"

246
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,300
Fear and discipline.

247
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Now?

248
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,500
Always.

249
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,400
Oh, my God.

250
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,600
Merry Christmas!

251
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,500
Merry Christmas, Sergeant!

252
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:13,500
l was going to give this scarf to him
last night, but he disappeared.

253
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,200
lt's beautiful, Jimmy.

254
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,000
He'll love it.

255
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,200
Well, he saved my life out there.
l guess Mace told you.

256
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,600
You should give it to him yourself.

257
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,300
He's in the meeting room.

258
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,400
He's doing exercises.

259
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:56,800
Children....

260
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,400
You're supposed to be doing your lessons.

261
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:13,900
Scarf!

262
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,500
People are upset about him.

263
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,500
There's going to be a meeting.

264
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:57,200
He's not fully recovered.

265
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,600
That's what scares people.

266
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,700
He gets stronger every day.

267
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,800
Are you scared of him, Mace?

268
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:18,700
Yes.

269
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:23,600
l've never been afraid of anyone before.
Not like this.

270
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,800
l feel he could break me in half
with no real effort and no real...

271
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,200
...feeling.

272
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:22,000
He is most happy when following orders.

273
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,900
A soldier shows no mercy.

274
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,600
Mercy is weakness.

275
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:29,500
Weakness is death.

276
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:32,400
A soldier needs no friend or family.

277
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,800
War is his friend.

278
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:36,800
The Forces are his family.

279
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:34,100
What the hell do you think you're doing?

280
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:36,400
You could have killed him.

281
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,800
No one here has any animosity
towards you, Sergeant.

282
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,900
None of us here is your enemy.

283
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:54,000
Furthermore, we respect your qualities.

284
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,300
We have no doubt that you are a very...

285
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:58,000
...very good soldier.

286
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:00,100
But because of your training...

287
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:03,700
...we don't think you'll ever be able
to function in a group like this:

288
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:05,500
A community of families...

289
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:06,900
...of children...

290
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:11,000
...where the ability to fight is not
the sole purpose of existence.

291
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,500
You're different from us, Sergeant.

292
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,400
We don't hate you for that.

293
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,500
But we have agreed
that to try to include you...

294
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:21,800
...would pose an intolerable risk
to the community itself.

295
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:26,300
We'll give you any tools you need:

296
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:30,400
Some warm clothing,
some boots, a good knife.

297
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:41,900
Sergeant, you're our friend.

298
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:45,900
lt's just....

299
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,800
lf you need us, you can ask us for help.

300
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:48,300
Command, we are on course
for Arcadia 234.

301
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:53,300
-How will you find him?
-He'll have stayed close to the wire.

302
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:55,200
What'll l tell the council?

303
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:56,800
We all voted.

304
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,200
We voted wrong.

305
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:45,600
We were wrong.

306
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,300
We made a mistake.

307
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:57,700
We're sorry.

308
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:25,900
lt's some kind of landing party.

309
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:27,600
Hey! Over here!

310
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:43,600
Stay with me, sir.

311
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:27,400
All units stand by
for Arcadia 234 security sweep.

312
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:31,500
Any trespassers will be considered hostile.

313
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,200
Wait! What's going on?

314
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:03,000
Somebody's landing!
Jimmy Pig spotted a ship!

315
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:30,500
Two hostiles at 12:00.

316
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:11,000
Hostiles eliminated.

317
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:02,800
lt's no good.

318
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,600
l've lost too much blood.

319
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:07,100
Why?

320
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:12,300
Was it a mistake?

321
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:28,000
Oh, God, no!

322
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:30,400
Not Sandra.

323
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:31,800
Please...

324
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:33,700
...not Nathan.

325
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:35,600
Please....

326
00:54:57,900 --> 00:54:58,800
People!

327
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:00,500
They spotted people!

328
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:02,100
Two civilians, unarmed.

329
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:05,500
They killed both of them. They spotted
smoke from some sort of camp.

330
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:07,000
Jesus Christ! A camp?

331
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:08,200
Excellent.

332
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:10,400
This'll be very good experience
for the men.

333
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:11,800
Let's see how they do.

334
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:13,400
Civilians need to be protected.

335
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:17,400
Whoever they are, they don't belong there.
Officially, they're hostiles.

336
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,100
Three-man fire team only.

337
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:30,100
Prepare to deploy.

338
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:34,600
Everybody!

339
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,100
Calm down!

340
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:38,000
Calm down.

341
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,200
l'm going to go out and talk to them.

342
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:44,400
Those of you with weapons,
prepare to defend us.

343
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:04,300
God, help us.

344
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:37,000
Three-man fire team in position.

345
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:40,100
Crawler to fire team.

346
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:41,800
Engage.

347
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:47,400
Report from Crawler 1 :
Everything under control.

348
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:49,600
-ls there resistance?
-lneffectual.

349
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:51,500
Three men are going in to clean them out.

350
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:53,900
Caine's ordered the rest to hold back.

351
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:56,100
Sounds reckless. Three against 50.

352
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:59,300
l can tell these men
have no combat experience.

353
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:01,600
The old ones, the veterans...

354
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:04,700
...they would've called for support,
just in case.

355
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:06,200
Speaking of the old ones...

356
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:09,900
...why don't we have Riley and his crew
put up the monitoring unit?

357
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,400
Atten-hut!

358
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:17,700
Sir.

359
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:19,900
Riley?

360
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:22,600
-Will we be issued weapons, sir?
-No, Riley.

361
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:24,300
Only soldiers get weapons.

362
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:25,800
Yes, sir!

363
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,500
You don't even have
to salute anymore, Riley.

364
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:04,500
Now!

365
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:35,100
You need any help, partner?

366
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,700
Riley and team deploying monitor unit.

367
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:01,600
Don't panic!

368
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:04,000
Up the stairs. Come on.

369
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:05,600
Will, take him.

370
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:14,700
Go, go!

371
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:16,400
Get inside the bedroom!

372
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:21,800
Come in, Unit 703.

373
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:24,400
Unit 703, do you copy?

374
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,000
A growl?

375
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:35,600
He heard a growl?

376
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:36,600
Well...

377
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:39,600
...he didn't say the word '"growl.'"
He said, '"a throat noise.'"

378
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:43,700
But l asked him to imitate it,
and it sounded like a growl to me.

379
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:50,200
We're obviously up against
a significant military presence here.

380
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:54,200
Well, let's send in the rest of the men.

381
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:55,500
Absolutely not.

382
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:59,700
Those bastards are just waiting
for us in there.

383
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:01,400
No.

384
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:03,400
We don't fall for an ambush.

385
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:04,500
Colonel...

386
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:06,400
...my daddy always said:

387
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:09,000
'"When you want to insert a nail
into a piece of wood...

388
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,400
'"...you don't do anything
fancy or glamorous.

389
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:14,700
'"Just take the damn hammer
and hit the son of a bitch till it's in.'"

390
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:17,800
What exactly does that crap mean
in English, Captain?

391
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:19,500
Withdraw your men.

392
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,600
Load them up with heavy artillery.

393
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:26,000
At night, they'll go back and pound
that place with mortars, rockets, cannons...

394
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:28,000
...everything we got...

395
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:30,200
...from a safe distance.

396
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:32,000
lt ain't fancy...

397
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:35,600
...but it will sure take care
of your hostile military force.

398
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:37,800
All right, do it. Withdraw the men.

399
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,200
Push really hard, okay? Hard.

400
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,800
They killed him, didn't they?

401
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:01,400
How do you know they'll be back?

402
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:03,400
Because they're soldiers, sir...

403
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:04,700
...like me.

404
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:09,000
-Why are they doing this?
-They're obeying orders, sir.

405
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:10,800
lt's their duty.

406
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:13,700
Do you know how many they'll be?

407
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:15,200
Seventeen more, sir.

408
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:17,600
You can't fight 17 on your own.

409
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:21,000
You have to organize us.
We're not cowards.

410
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:23,900
We'll do as you tell us.

411
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:25,600
-We'll fight.
-No.

412
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:30,300
Why not?

413
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:33,000
Soldiers deserve soldiers, sir.

414
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:35,200
But one soldier...

415
01:03:36,700 --> 01:03:38,200
...against 17?

416
01:03:39,700 --> 01:03:41,400
What are you going to do?

417
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:46,800
l'm going to kill them all, sir.

418
01:03:58,400 --> 01:03:59,900
Crawlers 1 and 2...

419
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:01,800
...proceed to settlement...

420
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:03,700
...and commence bombardment.

421
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:28,300
Crawler 1, we are red.

422
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:29,600
We are red.

423
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:31,900
Crawler 2 to Crawler 1 :

424
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:34,500
-Report.
-Crawler 2, we are two down.

425
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:36,100
Responding to sniper activity.

426
01:04:36,100 --> 01:04:38,100
Crawlers 1 and 2, split up.

427
01:04:38,100 --> 01:04:40,600
Crawler 1, locate and neutralize the sniper.

428
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:41,700
Caine 607...

429
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:44,100
...proceed to the settlement
and commence bombardment.

430
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:46,500
Roger, 1 . We're proceeding to target.

431
01:05:00,700 --> 01:05:02,800
Crawler 1, deploying ground forces.

432
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,100
All units...

433
01:07:49,100 --> 01:07:50,400
...report.

434
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:52,600
438, negative.

435
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,400
515, negative.

436
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,500
523, negative.

437
01:08:04,700 --> 01:08:08,000
Squad 1, to your 9:00!
Squad 2, stand by with covering fire!

438
01:08:22,300 --> 01:08:23,800
Enemy sniper at 12:00!

439
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:29,200
Sniper located!

440
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:06,900
-Ambush!
-Retreat!

441
01:10:01,300 --> 01:10:04,800
l think we have to assume
that the missing men are down.

442
01:10:05,300 --> 01:10:08,200
Maybe you should've made them smart
instead of fast.

443
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:18,400
Squad 1, do you copy?

444
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,800
Squad 2, do you copy?

445
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:23,200
Squad 3, do you copy?

446
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:26,300
607 to Command.
1.5 clicks from settlement.

447
01:10:26,700 --> 01:10:29,100
Will engage enemy in two minutes.

448
01:10:30,100 --> 01:10:31,400
Roger, 607.

449
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:37,600
Crawler 1 to Command.

450
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:40,400
We have lost radio contact
with all ground units.

451
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:42,900
We are still searching for the sniper.

452
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:49,900
Crawler 2 to Crawler 1 . Come in, 1 .

453
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:51,000
One.

454
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:54,500
Two to one. Take your port to our 9:00
and commence firing.

455
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:57,800
Affirmative, 2.
Port to 9:00 and commence firing.

456
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,400
Crawler 2 to Crawler 1 .

457
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:18,500
Again, proceed to Port 9:00.

458
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:20,100
Affirmative.

459
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:21,700
Proceed to Port 9:00.

460
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:30,200
Where's my father?

461
01:13:39,700 --> 01:13:40,900
Two to one.

462
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:43,800
You're still on 12:00. Correct: 9:00.

463
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:45,900
Affirmative, 2.

464
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,100
Crawler 1!

465
01:13:55,100 --> 01:13:57,800
You're on a collision course with me!

466
01:13:58,100 --> 01:13:59,300
Affirmative, 2.

467
01:14:40,300 --> 01:14:41,900
Crawler 1, do you copy?

468
01:14:42,700 --> 01:14:44,500
Crawler 2, do you copy?

469
01:14:45,100 --> 01:14:47,000
Are any ofyou men out there?

470
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,800
Can any ofyou men hear me?

471
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:53,000
Your men...

472
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:54,600
...are obsolete.

473
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,500
-Try Number 1 .
-l tried Number 1 ! l can't get either!

474
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:03,600
This is bad. We don't know
what we're up against. How many?

475
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:05,900
They couldn't get figures on enemy troops.

476
01:15:05,900 --> 01:15:08,600
We're sitting ducks.
There could be a few divisions out there.

477
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:11,200
We don't even have the weapons
to arm the old soldiers.

478
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:12,600
ls that a recrimination?

479
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:15,000
Because if it is,
l will have you court-martialed.

480
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,600
-No, sir.
-All right, don't panic. Don't panic.

481
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:19,400
l am not panicking!

482
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:04,300
Captain...

483
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:07,500
...you must have some
of those new DX-57s on board.

484
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:09,200
Planet killers, you mean.

485
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:10,600
We carry 15.

486
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:12,000
One's enough.

487
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,800
We set it on a short fuse
and we get out of here.

488
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:17,900
Boom. We win.

489
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:32,300
Brave. lt means that even
when you're scared...

490
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:34,700
...you control your emotions.

491
01:16:34,700 --> 01:16:37,400
You make the fear be really small and tiny.

492
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:39,600
Oh, no!

493
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,400
We should go, sir.

494
01:17:45,300 --> 01:17:46,300
Take him.

495
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:52,700
Go back.

496
01:17:59,500 --> 01:18:00,900
Go back! Go back!

497
01:22:32,300 --> 01:22:33,800
Right horizontal.

498
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:36,800
Roger. Right horizontal checks green.

499
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:38,300
What are we waiting for?

500
01:22:38,300 --> 01:22:39,400
Give us a go.

501
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:41,900
We'll give Riley and his men
seven more minutes.

502
01:22:41,900 --> 01:22:44,400
-Fuck them. Let's just go.
-Abandon them?

503
01:22:45,100 --> 01:22:47,800
l'll pretend l didn't hear that.
l'm the captain--

504
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:51,600
l'm your superior officer.
lt's my mission, my call. l say go.

505
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:54,500
Losing men in combat is one thing,
abandoning them--

506
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:56,900
l'm not going to die
because of your pompous bullshit.

507
01:22:56,900 --> 01:23:00,100
This is a direct order. Understand?
Take off now!

508
01:23:04,100 --> 01:23:07,400
Don't walk away from me,
you sniveling, West Point piece of--

509
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:20,000
Take the helm, Sloan.

510
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:21,900
Let's launch this thing.

511
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:25,600
Come on! On the double! Let's go!

512
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:32,200
Close up the lower hatch.

513
01:23:34,500 --> 01:23:36,400
Punch up your port power cluster.

514
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:37,400
What was that?

515
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:38,600
What was what?

516
01:23:44,900 --> 01:23:46,000
Get off of me!

517
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:50,200
Fucking morons! Get your hands off me!
Ten minutes to go, understand?

518
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:52,600
You're killing yourselves!

519
01:23:53,100 --> 01:23:54,500
What are you doing?

520
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:05,900
You?

521
01:24:19,300 --> 01:24:20,400
Please.

522
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:32,700
Please.

523
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:39,400
No!

524
01:25:01,300 --> 01:25:02,500
Don't leave us!

525
01:25:10,900 --> 01:25:12,500
We must get out of here!

526
01:25:12,500 --> 01:25:13,800
Colonel!

527
01:25:42,500 --> 01:25:45,200
lt's getting ready to detonate!
We must stop it!

528
01:25:45,200 --> 01:25:46,900
Fourteen seconds! Hurry!

529
01:25:48,900 --> 01:25:51,000
l can't remember if it's 6-7 or 7-6!

530
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:54,300
-Get out of the way!
-No, you don't know what you're doing!

531
01:25:55,200 --> 01:25:56,400
Hurry, hurry!

532
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:10,800
There.

533
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:12,900
Aye-aye, sir.

534
01:27:12,900 --> 01:27:15,200
Setting course for the Trinity Moons.
