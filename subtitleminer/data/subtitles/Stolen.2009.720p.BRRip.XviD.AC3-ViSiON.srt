He has his mother's eyes,

6
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:29,296
her hair.

7
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:34,927
My face, my laugh.

8
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:38,222
First time I held him,
l knew he was my son.

9
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,853
All the best of me...

10
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:48,232
and his mother.

11
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:51,401
l can still see his eyes
light up

12
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:54,196
watching those fireworks.

13
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:56,615
l gave him everything a father
could give his son.

14
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:04,164
And now,
with all this searching...

00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,667
being a cop, being a father...

16

00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:41,270
All right, bud, I told your mom

22
00:02:41,272 --> 00:02:42,910
we'd meet her down by the river
for fireworks.

23
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:43,450
We better get going.

24
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:45,247
Can I bring my swim trunks?

25
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:46,456
What are you, Mr. Cannonball?

26
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:47,916
You gonna get us all wet?

00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:57,217
Can I go outside
and get a balloon?

31
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:59,803
Why don't you stay here
until I come back?

Yes, there's plenty

00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,629
Oh!
Well, you lost your balloon.

Hey, man, have you seen
my kid anywhere?

44
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:38,217
About ten years old, light hair,
jeans, T-shirt?

ls it still raining?

50
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:58,171
No, it just stopped.

51
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:25,675
We've got something here.

52
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:28,011
Back up.

53
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:34,017
Whoa.

54
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:39,606
Oh, Jesus, Mary, Joseph.

What's wrong?

58
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:14,349
l'm going with you.

59
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,359
Hey.

60
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:26,820
Just wait here.

61
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:31,408
What's going on?

62
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,160
I don't know.
l just got here.

63
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,454
What's that got to do
with anything?

64
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,621
Just trying to get the facts.

65
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:38,373
Pete, what's going on here?

66
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:40,167
Tom, everybody's
been waiting for you, man,

67
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:43,753
but they wouldn't tell us
anything until you got here.

68
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,754
What do you got?

69
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,214
Not much to tell you.

70
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,675
Found this laying on the body.

71
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:59,060
Will you go talk to Barb,
make sure she's okay?

72
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:00,562
Yeah, I got it.

73
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:02,731
And then we also found this.

74
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,946
<i>"Keep the home fries burning."</i>

75
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:46,942
We don't know exactly
what we're dealing with here.

76
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,277
Jesus.

77
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:50,570
When they first
brought him in,

78
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,489
l noticed some cranial anomalies

79
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:55,825
which suggest the boy had
some form of mental impairment.

80
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,035
lmpairment?

81
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:59,120
Tommy wasn't-

82
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,247
That doesn't make any sense.

83
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,082
lt's definitely not your son,
Tom.

84
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,458
Are you sure?

85
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:05,252
l mean, he's...

86
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:08,421
exactly the same size
he would-

87
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,965
l know I recognize that whistle.

88
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:11,508
Decomposition of the body

89
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,301
in relation
to where it was found,

90
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:14,844
depth, temperature,

91
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:18,348
it reflects he's been in there
a lot longer than eight years.

92
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:20,433
We're not gonna know for sure
until the tests are back,

93
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,520
but l'd say it was closer
to 50 years.

94
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:27,065
l know this is really difficult
for you and Barb.

95
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:29,109
lf you want to do this
some other time, I understand.

96
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,611
No, no, l'm fine.

97
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,738
- We missed this
at the crime scene.

98
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:37,242
Found it underneath him
in what was left of his pocket.

99
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:38,910
1958.

100
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:41,746
What about cause of death?

101
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:44,583
Were you able to determine that?

102
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:47,377
No, we got nothing.

103
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:48,503
l don't know what to say, Tom.

104
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:50,839
l'm sorry.

105
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:53,258
So what do you want me to do?

106
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:57,178
Well, secure the body.

107
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,514
His parents
might still be alive.

108
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,183
And they would want to know.

109
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,404
lt's not him.

110
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,496
Come here.

111
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,585
l was so sure it was.

112
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:38,261
- Me too.
- Me too.

113
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:58,239
<i>Why don't you show Daddy
the picture you made?</i>

114
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:23,014
<i>Detective,</i>

115
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,934
<i>you believe Bert Rogianni
kidnapped your son</i>

116
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,978
<i>because he was arrested
for two similar crimes.</i>

117
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:29,979
<i>ls that right?</i>

118
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:32,440
Yes.

119
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:33,650
<i>Based on a hunch,</i>

120
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:36,695
<i>lacking concrete evidence.</i>

121
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,405
Why do you keep
bringing this up?

122
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:41,116
<i>Mr. Rogianni went to prison
for the other crimes</i>

123
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:43,535
<i>and still wouldn't confess
to your son's kidnapping.</i>

124
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:46,287
<i>And in the eight years
your son's been missing,</i>

125
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:48,456
<i>you haven't been able
to find his body.</i>

126
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:50,583
<i>ls that correct?</i>

127
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:58,091
Tom?

128
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:07,142
l'm gonna go for a run.

129
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:56,524
Hey, Sarge.

130
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,276
Some duty you pulled.

131
00:12:58,402 --> 00:12:59,360
Actually, I didn't pull it.

132
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,196
l put in for it.

133
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:02,781
Thought the case
might be interesting.

134
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,616
Anybody been around
asking questions?

135
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:06,868
Nah, just a bunch of kids.

136
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:10,205
Well, keep your eyes open.

137
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:14,209
Someone might want to come back
and inspect their work.

138
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:15,877
You really think
you're gonna figure out

139
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:17,754
what happened to this kid?

140
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,215
l'm gonna try like hell.

141
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,570
<i>Well, it suggests that the boy</i>

142
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:46,074
<i>was literally shoved
into the box post-mortem.</i>

143
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:58,461
<i>lt's definitely not your son,
Tom.</i>

144
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,808
<i>l've given you
the evidence you need.</i>

145
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:14,602
<i>That may be so, Detective,
but still,</i>

146
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:18,398
<i>the conviction on one crime
was overturned on appeal</i>

147
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:19,941
<i>and the government
is now considering</i>

148
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:22,861
<i>commuting Rogianni's
death sentence.</i>

149
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:24,612
<i>And so you've come
to voice your opposition</i>

150
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:26,114
<i>to this committee.</i>

151
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,782
<i>ls that correct?</i>

152
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:31,286
Tommy was my son,
my responsibility,

153
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:34,706
and Bert Rogianni
took him from me.

00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,274

<i>¢Ü Lonely me ¢Ü</i>

00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:27,425
<i>¢Ü So afraid ¢Ü</i>

160
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:30,595
<i>¢Ü Just say you love me ¢Ü</i>

161
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:33,932
Sorry to keep you waiting,
Matt.

162
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:38,311
lt's all right, Bill.

163
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,604
Why do I feel like

164
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,731
l'm being called
into the principal's office?

165
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:43,858
I got to be straight with you,
Matt.

166
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:45,735
We're not
in high school anymore.

167
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:47,695
Defaulting on a loan isn't like

168
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:49,864
being sent
to Mrs. Johnson's detention.

169
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,824
Bill, l'm gonna make a payment
real soon.

170
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:52,992
I hear you can't find a job.

171
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,410
Well, it's not just me.

172
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:55,912
There's no work in this town.

173
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:57,580
Maybe you should try
looking elsewhere.

174
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:59,207
I can't.

175
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,042
Not with Pearl's illness
gettin' worse

176
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:03,044
and needin' to be there
for John.

177
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:05,171
l need to be as close to home
as possible.

178
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,967
I can't lose that house.

179
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:11,344
lt's the only thing
holding my family together.

180
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,222
lf this bank forecloses now,
we'll have nothing.

181
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:16,933
I can't cover for you anymore,
Matt.

182
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,478
Two weeks.

183
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:21,896
You can give me that.

184
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:22,939
Two weeks.

185
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,649
I can give you two days.

186
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:26,317
After that,
it's out of my hands.

187
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:31,739
l'm sorry, Matt.

188
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:04,814
Hey, Pa.

189
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,566
Papa!

190
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:07,942
Hey, boys.

191
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:09,235
Did you guys mind your ma today?

192
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:10,445
Yes, Papa.

193
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:12,530
Pearl, honey,
food looks good.

194
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:13,698
You coming down?

195
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:14,907
Boys would love to see ya.

196
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:44,228
Mark, look!

197
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:46,564
Look!

198
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:53,488
"Yea, though I walk through

199
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:55,948
"the valley of the shadow
of death,

200
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,409
"l shall fear no evil,
for thou art with me.

201
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:02,497
"Thy rod and thy staff,
they comfort me.

202
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,916
"Surely goodness and mercy
shall follow me

203
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:08,002
"all the days of my life,

204
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:11,714
"and I shall dwell in the house
of the Lord

205
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,175
forever."

206
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:15,843
Amen.

207
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:18,012
Amen.

208
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:30,733
Now, you boys get yourselves
a nice treat with this.

209
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:34,153
And Mark, see that John
doesn't lose his.

210
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:37,031
Yes, Miss Betsy.

211
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:39,909
"Dearest Matthew,

212
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:42,995
"l'm so sorry for your loss
of Pearl.

213
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:46,582
"Please, don't mind Jonas,
and come to us immediately.

214
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,000
"Bring the boys.

215
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:51,003
Your loving Aunt Coral."

216
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,676
Have you boys
helped John pack?

217
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,219
Yes, sir.

218
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:01,347
Anyone need to use
the restroom?

219
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:03,808
John?

220
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:06,519
Mark.

221
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,840
Hey.

222
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:18,841
Anywhere okay?

223
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:20,593
Yeah, anywhere is fine.

224
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,518
Here you are.

225
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,145
Thank you.

226
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:32,980
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

227
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:34,982
What handsome
and well-mannered boys

228
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:36,484
you have here.

229
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:40,071
Your mama must be
especially proud.

230
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:41,822
Mama's with Jesus now.

231
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:44,575
Oh, l'm sorry.

232
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,287
We'll have, um...

233
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:55,169
four hamburgers, three Cokes,
and a coffee, black, please.

234
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:56,796
You got a bathroom?

235
00:20:56,922 --> 00:21:00,716
Mm-hmm, out back.

236
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:02,635
Order up, Sally Ann.

237
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:15,439
Damn it, Pearl,
why did you do this?

238
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:20,987
Burger's up.

239
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:40,423
You mind if I give your boys
a little something?

240
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:43,384
lt's just some advertising
for the diner.

241
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,052
"Keep the home fries burning."

242
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:46,178
Came up with it myself.

243
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,222
lt's kind of cute,
don't you think?

244
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:51,475
John.

245
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:54,312
Boys.

246
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:56,564
I hope I didn't cause
any harm.

247
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:59,275
No, it's just that we got
far to go, and l-

248
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:02,862
l won't have you boys
blowing these in the Rambler.

249
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,071
l'll give them to 'em tomorrow.

250
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:06,073
Thanks.

251
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:07,658
Boys.

252
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:12,288
You take care of yourself.

253
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:28,929
You boys know how to be polite
and respectful, so...

254
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:30,097
don't show me wrong.

255
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:31,640
- Yes, Papa.
- Yes, Papa.

256
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:44,236
They're here! They're here!

257
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:59,293
I can't believe she's gone.

258
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:03,672
I miss her so much.

259
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:06,258
l want to introduce you
to my boys.

260
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:07,968
This is Mark.

261
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:10,137
Mark, he's real good
with woodwork these days.

262
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:11,347
Got a real talent for that.

263
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:13,140
- Hello, Mark.
- Ma'am.

264
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:14,725
And this,
this is Luke.

265
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:16,936
Luke, real book smart.

266
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:17,937
Good with animals.

267
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:18,938
Hello, Luke.

268
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,147
Ma'am.

269
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:23,651
And this is John,
my youngest.

270
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:26,153
I got to pee!

271
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:27,822
l suppose it was a long trip.

272
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:29,490
You must be tired
after yourjourney.

273
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:31,617
Come on, now.

274
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:34,620
- Jonas.
- Matt.

275
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:35,830
Been a real long while.

276
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:37,540
Yeah, it has.

277
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:38,541
Hi.

278
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:39,542
This is Edvena.

279
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:41,335
Hi, Edvena.

280
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:43,087
You're even prettier
than your ma.

281
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,091
You all gonna stand there
forever,

282
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:51,554
I guess I can eat.

283
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,515
And before you could blink,
this whole table was cleared.

284
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:56,809
Your aunt Coral kicked
all us men out.

285
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:58,185
I was mid-bite
into an ear of corn.

286
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:01,856
You have-you have
never seen such a flurry.

287
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:04,650
And then your ma and I counted
all your fingers and toes.

288
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:06,902
Turns out you were perfect.

289
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:08,988
And then we brought your pa in
to see you.

290
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:11,198
l'd never seen anything
more beautiful in all my life

291
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:13,909
than you and your ma
lying on this very table, Mark.

292
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:16,162
Pa.

293
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,664
And I helped your ma
with you too, Luke.

294
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:22,293
You boys brought your ma
such happiness when you arrived.

295
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:24,503
What about me, Aunt Coral?

296
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:26,464
Did I make Ma happy?

297
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:31,802
Especially you, John.

298
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:34,555
Especially you.

299
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:36,432
Now, why don't you boys
show your appreciation

300
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:37,808
and go ahead
and clear this table?

301
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:38,893
Oh, no, no, leave it.

302
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:39,894
Edvena and I'll get it.

303
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,812
Matthew...

304
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:44,732
let's me and you go talk.

305
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:10,841
l admit, I was kind of expecting
a pack of wild lndians.

306
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:12,301
They're good, Jonas;
they're good.

307
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:14,094
They're not gonna give you
a lick of trouble,

308
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:15,387
l can promise you that.

309
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,932
I believe you, Matt.

310
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:19,600
So it's okay?

311
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:22,478
You can keep 'em?

312
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:24,897
That's just it.

313
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:32,530
lt ain't easy to say, so...

314
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:36,116
l'll just speak it plain.

315
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:38,619
We can take two of the boys.

316
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:40,788
We can't keep all three.

317
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:42,957
You and Coral
are the only family we got.

318
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:46,001
l can't break up the boys,
Jonas, give me a chance.

319
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:47,628
l'm asking for six months,
Jonas,

320
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:49,797
six months, maybe a year.

321
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:52,675
Just, just give me time
to get something going,

322
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:54,760
maybe even meet a woman
who can help take care of them.

323
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:58,889
Kind of like you shouldn't
have married in the first place.

324
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:01,767
What Pearl did
had nothing to do with me.

325
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:05,604
She was never right after John
was born, you know that.

326
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,690
Don't blame that backwards boy
of yours, neither.

327
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:09,733
Told Pearl she should
never have married you.

328
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:12,861
You watch your filthy mouth.

329
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:14,405
You count your blessings.

330
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:15,739
At least two of them boys,

331
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:17,700
they got Pearl's blood in 'em
and not yours.

332
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:31,422
l've said what I had to say.

333
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:34,174
lt's Mark and Luke
or none.

334
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:14,131
You're the co-pilot now.

335
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:22,389
Pa, don't go!

336
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:26,894
You boys be good.

337
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,854
Get in the car, John.

338
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:35,319
Good-bye!

339
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:44,912
Pa! Pa!

340
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:55,130
Here's your whistle.

341
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:06,600
Did you see this?

342
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:07,685
"Boy in the box"?

343
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:08,686
What is that?

344
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:11,438
Pete's just doing his job.

345
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:13,732
That boy had a name.

346
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:17,277
Well, l'm sure if he knew it,
he'd print it.

347
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:20,948
Nothing we need to get
worked up about, right?

348
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:24,702
That's my job.

349
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:26,120
Look, yourjob doesn't include

350
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:29,289
you getting upset
about a headline.

351
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:30,582
l'm not getting upset
about it.

352
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,126
l'm just taking care of it,
as usual.

353
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:34,503
When do you ever
bring work home?

354
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:36,088
Barb, goddamn it.

355
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:37,923
- l've got it.
- lt's fine, just leave it.

356
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:39,383
- lt's my fault.
- I'll take care of it.

357
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:40,676
lt's fine.

358
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:41,969
There are copies.

359
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:43,595
They're just fine,
don't worry about it.

360
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,973
God forbid anything should get
out of place in this house.

361
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:47,558
Just leave it!

362
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:03,050
<i>Thomas Adkins!</i>

363
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:07,513
<i>Tommy!</i>

364
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:10,808
What the hell were you thinking?

365
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:11,975
What's wrong?

366
00:30:12,101 --> 00:30:12,976
"Boy in the box"?

367
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:14,186
What is that?

368
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:15,896
lt's a news story
like any other, Tom.

369
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:16,980
No, Pete, it isn't.

370
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:18,232
This is different.

371
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:20,400
This is a 10-year-old boy
who was found dead,

372
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:22,820
and he damn sure didn't die
to make sure your rag of a paper

373
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:24,071
doesn't go out of business.

374
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:25,531
Look, if I can create
a little buzz

375
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:26,990
for the few days
this story is fresh,

376
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:28,033
so much the better.

377
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:31,703
And if calling him the boy in
the box helps spread the word,

378
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:32,871
it's going to help you as well.

379
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:35,249
Let's try to show
some respect, huh?

380
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:36,250
Hey.

381
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:37,751
Your mother called.

382
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:39,127
Did she tell you
that she was coming?

383
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:40,546
She must have seen
Pete's article.

384
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:41,922
Anytime she sees

385
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:44,424
anything with the slightest
connection to Tommy, Jr.,

386
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:46,510
she has to make her way
over here.

387
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:48,053
I'll call her
and tell her we're okay.

388
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:50,389
No, you can't.

389
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:53,559
She's on her way, and she said
she'd be here in an hour.

390
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,855
When are you gonna come home?

391
00:30:57,981 --> 00:30:59,523
I don't know.

392
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:00,607
l'll try to make it early.

393
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:02,109
Okay.

394
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:05,279
Look at this.

395
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:06,488
According to this inspection,

396
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:09,324
the building was started
in the spring of 1958.

397
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:11,285
Who was the contractor?

398
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:13,912
Guy named Bill Byrnes.

399
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:20,794
Where are you going?

400
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,337
I think I know his son.

401
00:31:22,463 --> 00:31:25,549
Jesus, you're talking
about '58.

402
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:27,050
l was a kid.

403
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:29,136
How the hell am I supposed
to remember shit like that?

404
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:31,388
Can you give us any names?

405
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:33,056
Well, Swede was around
back then.

406
00:31:33,182 --> 00:31:35,309
He was a foreman.

407
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:37,102
Other than that,
you're on your own.

408
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:38,812
They're probably all dead
by now, anyway.

409
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:40,188
No real names?

410
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:42,316
I told you,
they were all drifters,

411
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:43,734
only nicknames.

412
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,110
You ever see any kids around?

413
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:47,571
lt was a construction site.

414
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:50,115
l wasn't even allowed
to hang out.

415
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:53,785
Look, guys, it's been real,
but I got to get to work.

416
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:33,450
You need some gas?

417
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:36,536
Yeah, go ahead
and fill 'er all the way up.

418
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:38,288
Papa!

419
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:39,873
My boy needs a restroom.

420
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:41,750
Oh, we got an outhouse
in the back there.

421
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:43,210
How far to the nearest town?

422
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:45,212
That'd be Barnstable,
15 miles or so,

423
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:46,964
just a straight shot
down 32 here.

424
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,799
Thanks, much obliged.

425
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:50,550
Come on, John.

426
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:52,219
Come on.

427
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:54,513
Hey, you remember the Munsel
bathroom outside their house?

428
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:55,597
Uh-huh.

429
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:56,932
lt's different from ours,
right?

430
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:58,058
There's no flusher.

431
00:32:58,184 --> 00:33:00,143
No flusher, okay,
l won't flush.

432
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:02,104
lt's not that you don't-
don't flush,

433
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,773
it's that there is no flusher.

434
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:07,651
Okay, so I won't flush.

435
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:16,368
Whoops!

436
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:20,414
You don't have to do that.

437
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,290
Oh, thank you.

438
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:23,750
That's sweet.

439
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:25,377
lt's not a problem.

440
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:27,170
I suppose l'm gonna
have to start over again.

441
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:29,756
Guess so, huh?

442
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:32,050
You passing through?

443
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:33,427
Yeah, yeah, looking for work.

444
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:36,680
That's got to be tough
with a kid in tow.

445
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:37,723
You have no idea.

446
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:41,101
l'm sure you'll be all right.

447
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:43,937
Let me know
if you need anything.

448
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:46,064
Thank you.
Thank you kindly.

449
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:50,235
Hey, I don't know
where you're from,

450
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:53,280
but I don't like strangers
talking to my wife.

451
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:56,908
Papa!

452
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,201
We don't want
any trouble here.

453
00:33:58,327 --> 00:34:00,120
You and that queer boy
of yours found trouble,

454
00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:01,788
so you best be paying me
and moving on.

455
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:02,914
How much do I owe you?

456
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:06,334
- $9.57.
- Here's $10.

457
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:08,378
I don't expect I'll be seeing
you this way again.

458
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:10,922
I sure hope not.

459
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:16,636
I didn't know where you were.

460
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:18,096
I know, John.

461
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:27,689
Good-bye!

462
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:59,346
John.

463
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:00,972
Hey, John.

464
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:02,224
John, l'm gonna go in here

465
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,101
and find us a place
to sleep tonight, all right?

466
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:05,435
You'll be able to see me

467
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:07,562
right through that barbershop
window there, okay?

468
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:23,745
Oh, uh, howdy, boss.

469
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:24,830
Uh, you want a cut?

470
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:27,582
Uh, no, not today, thanks.

471
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:29,960
l was wondering if any of you
knew a cheap place

472
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:31,670
to stay in town?

473
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:35,173
¢Ü Pretty red plane
in the sky ¢Ü

474
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:38,718
¢Ü billowing clouds
go by and by ¢Ü

475
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:40,929
My daddy taught me that song,

476
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:44,224
gave me lots of shiny gifts.

477
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:47,477
Your daddy give you shiny gifts,
boy?

478
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:51,898
You walk down this street,
and you turn left on Dixon.

479
00:35:52,024 --> 00:35:55,068
Maybe if you're a good boy,

480
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:57,112
l'll get you that plane.

481
00:35:57,238 --> 00:36:00,157
You can fly off
into the wild blue yonder.

482
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:03,618
l'm a-l'm a good boy.

483
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:05,620
Yes, you are.

484
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:10,625
Do any of you know is there
any work to get in town?

485
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:12,627
Yeah, they're doing
some new building

486
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:14,504
on the north side of town.

487
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,755
You can talk to Bill Byrnes.

488
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:16,965
Byrnes.

489
00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:19,217
You can tell him Delaney
told you to look him up.

490
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:21,011
- Delaney.
- Yeah.

491
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:23,013
Thank you.
Thank you kindly.

492
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:35,317
John?

493
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:40,113
John Wakefield.

494
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:42,616
John.

495
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:44,576
Sure is shiny, pa.

496
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:47,287
John, do you hear me?

497
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:48,330
Yes, Pa.

498
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:51,458
Come on.

499
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,709
Wait.

500
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:58,256
Where'd you get that?

501
00:36:58,382 --> 00:36:59,758
Nice man gave it to me.

502
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:00,759
Who?
What man?

503
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:01,760
Where is he?

504
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:04,763
The nice man.

505
00:37:06,098 --> 00:37:08,642
l think I found us a place
to sleep tonight.

506
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:57,857
<i>Can I go outside?</i>

507
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:06,449
Why are you gonna stay
in the car?

508
00:38:06,575 --> 00:38:08,576
'Cause l'm a good co-pilot.

509
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:11,705
What does a good co-pilot do?

510
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:14,749
A good co-pilot
never leaves his post.

511
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:17,002
All right.

512
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:20,797
Excuse me, uh, Bill Byrnes?

513
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:22,215
Over there.

514
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:24,384
You're standin' around
like it's Christmas!

515
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,011
Step it up.

516
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:27,220
Bill Byrnes?

517
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:28,388
Can I do for you?

518
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:29,556
l'm Matthew Wakefield.

519
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:31,266
l'm looking for work, sir.

520
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:33,268
I ain't hiring
no more drifters.

521
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:34,561
Too many already.

522
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:37,230
Could use another man,
and you know it.

523
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:38,690
What, you want him
to take yourjob?

524
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:40,775
Mind your own goddamn business.

525
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:41,985
Drifters.

526
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:44,404
Delaney said I should stop by.

527
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:46,364
Don't mean nothing to me.

528
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,199
lf you want to get this thing
up on time,

529
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,492
you're gonna need another man.

530
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:51,536
I don't need your
calculations, college-boy.

531
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:52,871
Love you too, Byrnes.

532
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:55,915
Sir, l'm sorry to bother you,
but, uh...

533
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:56,958
l need the work.

534
00:38:57,084 --> 00:38:58,835
l got a boy I need to feed.

535
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:03,923
You a thief?

536
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,216
No, sir,
l'm a God-fearing man.

537
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,344
Christian, huh?

538
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:11,222
Well, what can you do,
Christian?

539
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:12,724
You name it,
anything, sir.

540
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,100
Cement mixing and stonework?

541
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:16,269
Sir, masonry, metalwork.

542
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:18,104
Got a real talent with wood.

543
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,105
When can you start?

544
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:21,816
Right now, sir.

545
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:23,276
You go see the big Swede
over there.

546
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:24,611
Swede?

547
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:26,029
- That's right.
- Thank you, sir.

548
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:30,075
Sorry to bother you.

549
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:31,826
All right, let's move it!

550
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:33,119
Matthew Wakefield.

551
00:39:33,245 --> 00:39:34,245
Call me Swede.

552
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:43,046
Come on, Mark.

553
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:50,720
<i>"Dear Mark and Luke,</i>

554
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:55,308
<i>"l hope you boys are behaving
for Aunt Coral and Uncle Jonas.</i>

555
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:58,228
<i>"l know you don't understand
why I had to go,</i>

556
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:01,856
<i>"but I'll be back soon.</i>

557
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:04,567
<i>"l found a job in a place
where we can start over,</i>

558
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:06,903
<i>"be a family again.</i>

559
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:10,990
<i>"John and I miss you two
so much.</i>

560
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:13,451
<i>Your loving father."</i>

561
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:16,913
Swede, I know you don't like
to hear this, but...

562
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:18,331
the Russians
were on to something.

563
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:20,375
Mark my words, in our lifetime,

564
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:22,127
we will see men
living on the moon.

565
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:24,379
lf it'll make these things
lighter, l'm all for it.

566
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:25,547
Whoa-ho!

567
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:27,006
Swede, you hear that?

568
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:30,301
We just got our first complaint
from the man after one month.

569
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:31,678
Swede, you owe me a buck.

570
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:33,847
Only if you tell me why
they are lighter.

571
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:35,014
That's easy.

572
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:36,516
They'd be lighter
because on the moon,

573
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:38,017
there's a weaker force
of gravity.

574
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,018
Bullshit.

575
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:40,186
You're so full of it, Diploma.

576
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:42,105
No, gentlemen, I read.

577
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:44,107
And with knowledge comes power.

578
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:45,191
Swede.

579
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:48,278
Give the ltalian a hand.

580
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:51,364
Now, you two knock off early.

581
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:52,532
And be on time tomorrow.

582
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:54,701
We're pouring the cement.

583
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:56,369
Christian.

584
00:40:56,495 --> 00:40:58,246
l need to talk to you.

585
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:03,918
All right, l'm gonna go get
drunk, you coming?

586
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:05,503
Yeah, fine.

587
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:11,801
We can't have this anymore.

588
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:13,136
He ain't done no harm
to nobody.

589
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:14,137
l told you when I signed on,

590
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:15,346
l ain't got no place for him.

591
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:19,726
Look, Christian,
l come to like your kid.

592
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:21,060
l'd even ask some folks,

593
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:24,147
but I don't think
they could handle his quirks.

594
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:26,024
l'm a good worker, ain't l?

595
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,276
You're the best worker I got.

596
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:29,944
But you getting fired
and me getting fired

597
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,154
is two different things.

598
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,739
Now, you can come to work
tomorrow or not,

599
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:34,532
but you can't bring the kid.

600
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:44,501
- Come on.
- Okay.

601
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:46,544
Spin me, Pa.

602
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,463
Whee!

603
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:11,653
Fiola and Kramer
Toys and Novelties.

604
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:13,821
Went out of business
in the early '70s.

605
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:17,534
And I looked into this.

606
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:18,952
Yeah?
What'd you find out?

607
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:21,204
My best guess is that
it's some sort of toy.

608
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:25,959
Good job.

609
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:29,837
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

610
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:28,479
<i>You've reached the office
of the warden</i>

611
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:29,939
<i>at Pleasant Valley
state prison.</i>

612
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:08,895
Yeah, Lisa.

613
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:11,064
lt's Tom.

614
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:13,149
l want you to look into
something for me.

615
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:16,110
I just love all the work

616
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:18,071
you've put into remodeling
the house,

617
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:21,240
but I can't find a single thing.

618
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:27,872
Thought it would be nice
to mix it up.

619
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:30,583
Barbara?

620
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:32,251
Hmm?

621
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:44,222
lt's okay.

622
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:46,641
l'll get something to clean it.

623
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:58,069
You know, Barbara, we've got
plenty of the plain.

624
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:00,488
l just thought it'd be nice
to mix it up.

625
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:09,288
Barbara?

626
00:45:49,496 --> 00:45:51,831
He doesn't like anyone
to come in here.

627
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,962
l can't live like this anymore.

628
00:45:58,088 --> 00:46:02,258
- No, you can't.
- Hello?

629
00:46:02,384 --> 00:46:04,051
Barb?

630
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:07,805
We'll be right there, Tom.

631
00:46:21,653 --> 00:46:23,780
- How was your day?
- Pretty good.

632
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:27,658
So Barb will be down
in a minute.

633
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:29,660
Sit down;
l'll make you a cup of coffee.

634
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:31,579
You can tell me all about
that boy you found.

635
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:18,709
I want to have Tommy, Jr.
declared legally dead.

636
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:26,050
lt's time, Tom.

637
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,682
l can't keep pretending
that he is gonna come home.

638
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:36,853
l'm not talking about this
right now.

639
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:39,021
And l'm not letting it go
this time.

640
00:47:39,147 --> 00:47:40,857
We have to come
to an understanding.

641
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:42,984
l can't live like this anymore.

642
00:47:47,155 --> 00:47:48,364
l want to clean out his room.

643
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:50,366
Barb, you have no idea
what you're talking about.

644
00:47:50,492 --> 00:47:53,286
He wouldn't even be
that 10-year-old boy anymore.

645
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:55,204
You don't touch anything
until there is a body.

646
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:57,582
He would be 18,
already a man.

647
00:47:57,708 --> 00:47:58,791
l'm warning you.

648
00:47:58,917 --> 00:47:59,792
Just say it.

649
00:47:59,918 --> 00:48:02,920
Just say it, Tom.

650
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:06,007
Just say,
"My son is dead."

651
00:48:33,285 --> 00:48:34,869
- Thanks, Dan.
- lt's okay.

652
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:36,329
Look, I know
what you're gonna say,

653
00:48:36,455 --> 00:48:37,413
but just hear me out.

654
00:48:37,539 --> 00:48:38,664
You know you can't
talk to him.

655
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:39,999
lt's not about that.

656
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:42,126
l want to talk to him
about this kid we just found.

657
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:43,794
Yeah, sure.

658
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:45,838
You have been up my ass
ever since you heard

659
00:48:45,964 --> 00:48:47,340
his death sentence
might be commuted.

660
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:48,424
Just give me five minutes.

661
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:50,051
You know I can't do that.

662
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:52,178
And besides, the last time
l gave you five minutes,

663
00:48:52,304 --> 00:48:53,638
you almost put him
in the infirmary.

664
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:56,724
That was my son, Russell.

665
00:48:56,850 --> 00:49:01,771
I know.

666
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:06,108
But I can't help you, Tom.

667
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:10,696
Please don't come here anymore.

668
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:36,013
<i>Opening exit.</i>

669
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:38,057
<i>Have a good night.</i>

670
00:49:38,183 --> 00:49:39,558
Look, you're trying
to make this case

671
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:41,644
about a guy
who was found innocent,

672
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:43,729
who's already serving
a life sentence,

673
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:45,731
and whatever shit
you think you have on him,

674
00:49:45,857 --> 00:49:47,650
he can't be tried
for it again anyway.

675
00:49:47,776 --> 00:49:49,694
All right...

676
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,404
someone owes me a drink.

677
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:53,322
This took a lot longer
than I thought it would,

678
00:49:53,448 --> 00:49:56,409
but your idea...

679
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:58,536
was brilliant.

680
00:49:58,662 --> 00:49:59,954
ls that the-

681
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,455
That's the boy?

682
00:50:01,581 --> 00:50:03,416
I think it's pretty close
to what he looked like.

683
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:07,753
This is unbelievable work,
Lisa.

684
00:50:07,879 --> 00:50:10,881
We got to get this out
to all the channels we know.

685
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:13,009
l'm on it.

686
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:34,864
lt's not right.

687
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:37,074
l mean,
he's a good kid.

688
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,911
l'm tired.

689
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:42,913
I know, me too.

690
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,999
What's the matter, Pa?

691
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:46,208
You sad?

692
00:50:46,334 --> 00:50:48,294
Yeah, John, l'm sad.

693
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:51,464
Sad like Mama was sad?

694
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:52,506
No.

695
00:50:52,632 --> 00:50:55,468
No, not like your mama was sad.

696
00:50:55,594 --> 00:50:57,386
Okay.

697
00:50:57,512 --> 00:50:59,805
Hey, Christian, l...

698
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:02,016
l wish there was something
l could do to help you.

699
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:03,809
I got to go.

700
00:51:03,935 --> 00:51:04,935
l got to get out of here.

701
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:06,687
You ready to go, John?

702
00:51:06,813 --> 00:51:09,398
But l'm the co-pilot,
not you.

703
00:51:09,524 --> 00:51:10,608
Hold on.

704
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:12,026
This might just be
your lucky night.

705
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:14,361
What are you talking about?

706
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:16,489
I think it's pretty damn clear
what l'm talking about,

707
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:17,490
don't you think?

708
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:18,824
You just let me do the talking,
shy boy.

709
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:20,284
Hello there.

710
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:21,619
Hey.

711
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:22,661
This is your son, right?

712
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:24,663
Yeah, this is John.

713
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:25,664
Hello.

714
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:26,665
Oh, my.

715
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:29,376
Aren't you a polite little man?

716
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:31,337
We were never
properly introduced.

717
00:51:31,463 --> 00:51:32,338
l'm Rose Montgomery.

718
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:33,339
Matthew Wakefield.

719
00:51:33,465 --> 00:51:35,716
They call me Diploma.

720
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:37,384
l'm glad to have a chance
to see you again.

721
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:38,719
Did you find a job?

722
00:51:38,845 --> 00:51:40,679
lt's so funny you should
mention that, actually,

723
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:42,348
we were just discussing
a situation that's arisen.

724
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:43,808
Papa, l'm ready
to go to bed now.

725
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:45,101
l'm sorry, am I keeping you?

726
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:46,393
No, not at all.

727
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,479
Christian and I were just about
to have another drink.

728
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:49,855
Christian?

729
00:51:49,981 --> 00:51:51,607
Just a nickname we gave
ol' Matty boy here.

730
00:51:51,733 --> 00:51:52,691
Come on, Matty.

731
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:54,318
Be a gentleman;
buy the nice lady a drink.

732
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:55,986
Let John sleep in the car.

733
00:51:57,197 --> 00:51:58,948
Paradise cocktail, Mike.

734
00:51:59,074 --> 00:52:01,367
Diploma, I got to get him
to bed.

735
00:52:03,078 --> 00:52:06,872
Could you excuse us
just one second?

736
00:52:06,998 --> 00:52:11,919
Uh, look after the boy,
would you?

737
00:52:15,215 --> 00:52:16,549
What the hell are you doing?

738
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:18,551
You're looking for someone
to look after your kid,

739
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:20,177
and she's standing
right in front of you.

740
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:21,720
Diploma, she's got a husband.

741
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:23,764
Matty, I know you've seen
the way she's looking at you.

742
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:25,850
You make that woman smile,
she'll do anything you ask.

743
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:29,937
I can't.

744
00:52:30,063 --> 00:52:30,938
lt ain't right.

745
00:52:32,065 --> 00:52:33,566
"lt ain't right."

746
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:35,943
What is right,
you losing yourjob?

747
00:52:36,069 --> 00:52:38,028
Think about the boy.

748
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:40,865
Come on.

749
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:43,200
So you two got it
all worked out?

750
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:44,785
I believe we do.

751
00:52:44,911 --> 00:52:48,831
Christian?

752
00:52:48,957 --> 00:52:50,124
See you tomorrow.

753
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:55,754
So can I get you a drink?

754
00:52:56,923 --> 00:52:57,965
l already have one.

755
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:02,845
Are you sure this is okay,
us having a drink together?

756
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:05,931
l mean, with your husband
and all?

757
00:53:06,057 --> 00:53:08,100
l'm a big girl.

758
00:53:10,312 --> 00:53:11,770
You a big boy?

759
00:53:13,648 --> 00:53:15,900
Papa.

760
00:53:16,943 --> 00:53:19,111
l'm sorry.

761
00:53:19,237 --> 00:53:20,738
l got to get him home.

762
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:24,033
Good-bye.

763
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:25,367
lf you change your mind.

764
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:32,917
Come on, John.

765
00:53:40,842 --> 00:53:42,259
We've got a bit of a drive
in front of us,

766
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:43,886
so why don't you get in the back
and lay down

767
00:53:44,012 --> 00:53:45,888
and go to sleep, all right?

768
00:53:46,014 --> 00:53:47,848
- Okay.
- Okay.

769
00:53:47,974 --> 00:53:50,267
Go on in there, lie down.

770
00:53:56,441 --> 00:53:58,525
l'm just gonna cover you up,
all right?

771
00:53:58,652 --> 00:54:00,694
When am I gonna see
the nice lady again?

772
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:01,737
You liked her?

773
00:54:01,863 --> 00:54:03,656
Mm-hmm.

774
00:54:03,782 --> 00:54:04,990
l thought she was pretty.

775
00:54:05,116 --> 00:54:07,826
Yeah?

776
00:54:10,455 --> 00:54:11,664
Here, look, you just stay put.

777
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:13,040
l'll be back in a few minutes,
okay?

778
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:14,458
Go ahead and go to sleep.

779
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:17,419
Whatever you do,
you do not leave this car, John.

780
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:23,634
John?

781
00:54:51,496 --> 00:54:53,205
Come on.

782
00:54:53,331 --> 00:54:55,165
That's all you got?

783
00:55:38,084 --> 00:55:39,376
Papa?

784
00:55:46,426 --> 00:55:48,761
Maybe we could make this...

785
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:50,637
a regular thing.

786
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:53,766
Huh?

787
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:59,271
You could, uh, give me a hand
with my boy some days.

788
00:55:59,397 --> 00:56:00,439
Huh?

789
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:08,280
What?
What's funny?

790
00:56:08,406 --> 00:56:11,116
Well, you just got it
all figured out, don't you?

791
00:56:16,915 --> 00:56:19,291
Oh, hey, come on, don't be mad.

792
00:56:19,417 --> 00:56:22,211
Come on.

793
00:56:22,337 --> 00:56:24,338
This was a mistake.

794
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:26,423
l got to get back to my boy.

795
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:28,592
Come-

796
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:48,153
Damn it!

797
00:56:52,784 --> 00:56:54,743
John? John?

798
00:56:57,414 --> 00:56:58,497
Have you seen my boy, my son?

799
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:00,165
No, kids aren't allowed
in here.

800
00:57:00,291 --> 00:57:01,166
What?

801
00:57:01,292 --> 00:57:02,751
My boy was just here.

802
00:57:02,877 --> 00:57:04,461
Look, I don't want
any trouble, all right?

803
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:05,546
What are you talking about?

804
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:06,547
Don't lie to me.

805
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:07,548
Have you seen my son?

806
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:10,008
Not since you left with him.

807
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:11,802
John?

808
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:15,305
John?

809
00:57:16,808 --> 00:57:18,767
Rose! Rose!

810
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:33,407
John!

811
00:57:44,335 --> 00:57:45,210
John?

812
00:57:45,336 --> 00:57:46,920
John.

813
00:57:47,046 --> 00:57:49,715
What in God's name?

814
00:57:49,841 --> 00:57:50,716
- Have you seen him?
- Who?

815
00:57:50,842 --> 00:57:53,135
- Have you seen my son?
- No.

816
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:10,986
Hold on.

817
00:58:14,407 --> 00:58:16,450
Christian,
what the hell are you-

818
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:17,534
- What's wrong?
- lt's John.

819
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:18,535
What happened?

820
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:21,705
I can't find John.

821
00:58:21,831 --> 00:58:23,832
Let me get some clothes on.
Hold on.

822
00:58:29,881 --> 00:58:30,923
Johnny!

823
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:33,258
John!

824
00:58:33,384 --> 00:58:36,011
l'm sorry to get you
out of bed, Mike.

825
00:58:36,137 --> 00:58:37,930
lt's okay, chief,
l just don't want any trouble.

826
00:58:38,056 --> 00:58:39,681
Oh, don't worry.

827
00:58:39,807 --> 00:58:41,183
He saw my kid.

828
00:58:41,309 --> 00:58:42,267
He served all three of us.

829
00:58:42,393 --> 00:58:43,268
He gave him a root beer!

830
00:58:43,394 --> 00:58:45,229
All right, all right.

831
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:46,939
Mike, you leveling with me
or not?

832
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:48,565
You know I don't want kids
in that bar.

833
00:58:48,691 --> 00:58:50,859
No, I wouldn't do something
crazy like that, chief.

834
00:58:50,985 --> 00:58:51,944
Now, officer, that's a lie.

835
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:52,945
The boy was in the bar,

836
00:58:53,071 --> 00:58:54,363
and there was another girl
in there

837
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:55,614
who could back us up on that.

838
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:56,907
What girl?

839
00:59:01,996 --> 00:59:03,872
l asked you what girl?

840
00:59:03,998 --> 00:59:07,042
Her name was Rose.

841
00:59:07,168 --> 00:59:08,961
George's Rose?

842
00:59:09,087 --> 00:59:09,962
She came in after we did.

843
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:11,296
She ordered a paradise cocktail.

844
00:59:11,422 --> 00:59:13,382
You've got to remember that.

845
00:59:13,508 --> 00:59:16,635
ls that true, Mikey?

846
00:59:16,761 --> 00:59:18,470
- No, Rose wasn't in there.
- You son of a bitch.

847
00:59:18,596 --> 00:59:19,555
My boy is missing.

848
00:59:19,681 --> 00:59:21,974
- You're lying through your teeth!
- Hey!

849
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:24,059
Mikey, go inside.

850
00:59:24,185 --> 00:59:25,644
That's it, you're just gonna
let him go?

851
00:59:25,770 --> 00:59:27,771
Hey, you want to come with me
to the filling station

852
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:30,482
and ask George if his wife's
been out alone?

853
00:59:30,608 --> 00:59:31,900
'Cause we can do that.

854
00:59:33,611 --> 00:59:34,987
You're a real gentleman,
aren't you?

855
00:59:35,113 --> 00:59:36,780
lt don't matter if my son
was in the bar or not.

856
00:59:36,906 --> 00:59:38,156
He's missing.

857
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:39,658
l'm just asking to give me
a few more men

858
00:59:39,784 --> 00:59:40,659
to help look for him.

859
00:59:40,785 --> 00:59:42,035
l'm gonna need your names.

860
00:59:42,161 --> 00:59:46,665
I don't want trouble
with the law.

861
00:59:46,791 --> 00:59:49,334
Sorry, Christian.

862
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:51,169
You come to the station
in the morning.

863
00:59:51,296 --> 00:59:53,839
File a missing person's report.

864
00:59:53,965 --> 00:59:55,299
We'll talk then.

865
00:59:56,801 --> 00:59:57,759
That's it?

866
00:59:57,885 --> 00:59:59,428
That's it?

867
00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:01,054
My son is missing now.

868
01:00:03,474 --> 01:00:05,100
All right, come on, Christian,

869
01:00:05,226 --> 01:00:07,144
he's not gonna
do anything tonight.

870
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:08,520
Come on.

871
01:00:08,646 --> 01:00:10,814
We'll keep looking.
We'll find him.

872
01:00:26,414 --> 01:00:27,873
Christian, what are we doing
this far out?

873
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:30,334
Everybody has to come by here.

874
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:48,060
We're closed.

875
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:55,108
Thought we had an understanding.

876
01:00:55,234 --> 01:00:58,612
My boy,
my son's gone missing.

877
01:00:58,738 --> 01:01:00,697
The retard?

878
01:01:00,823 --> 01:01:02,240
ls everything all right?

879
01:01:02,367 --> 01:01:05,619
Yeah, seems, uh,
the retard boy went missing.

880
01:01:05,745 --> 01:01:06,787
Call him that again,

881
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:08,789
so help me God,
l'll rip your head off.

882
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:09,831
Let him go.

883
01:01:09,957 --> 01:01:11,583
Christian, it's not worth it.

884
01:01:11,709 --> 01:01:14,920
He don't understand.

885
01:01:15,046 --> 01:01:16,338
What can we do?

886
01:01:16,464 --> 01:01:17,631
You see him, you call me.

887
01:01:17,757 --> 01:01:20,384
Someone comes by here with him,
you get their plates,

888
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:21,385
you call me.

889
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:22,386
l'm at Birdie Wheeler's.

890
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:24,596
All right, consider it done.

891
01:01:27,016 --> 01:01:28,600
All right, where to next?

892
01:01:28,726 --> 01:01:29,851
l'm gonna take you home.

893
01:03:35,853 --> 01:03:37,395
Christian.

894
01:03:37,522 --> 01:03:39,147
Did you find him?

895
01:03:39,273 --> 01:03:40,148
No.

896
01:03:40,274 --> 01:03:41,149
Any sign of him here?

897
01:03:41,275 --> 01:03:43,026
No.

898
01:03:43,152 --> 01:03:44,027
I looked everywhere.

899
01:03:44,153 --> 01:03:45,737
l called all morning for him.

900
01:03:45,863 --> 01:03:47,197
Nothing's happening,
but nothing.

901
01:03:47,323 --> 01:03:50,617
Did you go to the police
this morning?

902
01:03:50,743 --> 01:03:53,203
Yeah, he listened to
everything I had to say, but...

903
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:56,164
l could see in his eyes
he ain't gonna do nothing.

904
01:03:56,290 --> 01:03:57,457
l got to keep searching.

905
01:03:57,583 --> 01:04:00,460
l want to thank you
for being a good friend to us.

906
01:04:09,887 --> 01:04:10,971
How's he doing?

907
01:04:15,309 --> 01:04:18,103
I hate to see a good man
suffer like that.

908
01:04:18,229 --> 01:04:20,188
You think he'll find his kid?

909
01:04:27,154 --> 01:04:28,655
We have to pour the cement.

910
01:04:28,781 --> 01:04:31,491

any questions should be

Needless to say,

01:05:52,657 --> 01:05:55,533
we have very little information
as to the identity-

928

Yes, sir.

Well, if that doesn't get 'em,
nothing will.

944
01:06:50,381 --> 01:06:52,048
Hey, Sarge,
l don't know if it's anything,

945
01:06:52,174 --> 01:06:53,967
but I got a plate number
on an old Chevelle.

946
01:06:54,093 --> 01:06:55,510
Seen it around here
a couple times.

947

snoop around but didn't dare.

All right, well...

What do you got?

953
01:07:07,481 --> 01:07:09,441
Phones started ringing
off the hook 20 minutes ago.

954
01:07:09,567 --> 01:07:12,610
Maybe we're onto something.

955
01:07:12,737 --> 01:07:14,404
You get started on these.

956
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:15,780
Call DMV about that
old Chevelle.

957
01:07:15,906 --> 01:07:18,033
Yep, l'm on it.

958
01:07:24,331 --> 01:07:25,623

Hello?

964
01:08:42,535 --> 01:08:44,410
May I help you?

965
01:08:44,537 --> 01:08:46,037
Mrs. Adams?

966
01:08:46,163 --> 01:08:47,997
l'm Detective Tom Adkins.

967
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:49,707
This is Pete Dunn.

968
01:08:49,834 --> 01:08:52,544
We're here about
the boy we found.

969
01:08:52,670 --> 01:08:54,129
You called us?

970
01:08:54,255 --> 01:08:57,048
I didn't expect you so soon.

971
01:08:57,174 --> 01:08:59,926
Please call me Edvena.

972
01:09:00,052 --> 01:09:04,556
So when Uncle Matthew came back
to get the other two boys,

973
01:09:04,682 --> 01:09:07,517
there was a lot of whispering
between Ma and Pa.

974
01:09:07,643 --> 01:09:09,561
Excuse me, other boys?

975
01:09:09,687 --> 01:09:10,937
John wasn't an only child?

976
01:09:11,063 --> 01:09:13,690
Oh, heavens, no.

977
01:09:13,816 --> 01:09:16,442
Mark, he was the eldest.

978
01:09:16,569 --> 01:09:17,944
Flying was his passion.

979
01:09:18,070 --> 01:09:19,737
A hero in Vietnam.

980
01:09:19,864 --> 01:09:21,739
He died young, though.

981
01:09:21,866 --> 01:09:24,909
Just a few years
after his father.

982
01:09:25,035 --> 01:09:26,411
And the-
the other son?

983
01:09:26,537 --> 01:09:28,955
Luke.

984
01:09:29,081 --> 01:09:30,665
Luke just sort of...

985
01:09:30,791 --> 01:09:32,542
drifted away from us.

986
01:09:32,668 --> 01:09:34,627
People do that, you know.

987
01:09:34,753 --> 01:09:37,172
You, um...
you mentioned a home?

988
01:09:37,298 --> 01:09:39,048
Uncle Matthew told everyone

989
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:41,426
that John was being
taken care of

990
01:09:41,552 --> 01:09:45,471
in a place
for backward children.

991
01:09:45,598 --> 01:09:47,182
Backward?

992
01:09:47,308 --> 01:09:49,851
I just saw him that once,

993
01:09:49,977 --> 01:09:51,978
but you could never forget him.

994
01:09:52,104 --> 01:09:55,440
He was the sweetest boy.

995
01:09:55,566 --> 01:09:57,942
l remember he kept showing me

996
01:09:58,068 --> 01:10:02,238
this half-dollar
that someone gave him.

997
01:10:03,866 --> 01:10:06,951
Such sadness.

998
01:10:10,331 --> 01:10:12,582
Do you have children, Detective?

999
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:35,480
That the one?

1000
01:10:35,606 --> 01:10:36,856
That's the one.

1001
01:10:38,776 --> 01:10:40,318
No mistaking that, huh?

1002
01:10:48,077 --> 01:10:51,079
Can I help you?

1003
01:10:51,205 --> 01:10:52,664
Luke Wakefield?

1004
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:53,998
Yes, sir.

1005
01:10:54,124 --> 01:10:56,709
l'm Detective Tom Adkins
from over in Barnstable.

1006
01:10:56,835 --> 01:11:00,964
l'd like to talk to you
about your brother John.

1007
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:03,633
ls there someplace maybe
we can go sit down?

1008
01:11:03,759 --> 01:11:07,262
Sure, yeah, we can
go right in the back here.

1009
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:12,934
And all this time
you believed John was in a home?

1010
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:14,602
Well, no,
when I got old enough,

1011
01:11:14,728 --> 01:11:17,146
l asked my dad about John.

1012
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:20,400
l had this idea
that I wanted to go visit him.

1013
01:11:20,526 --> 01:11:21,651
And that's when my dad
said to me

1014
01:11:21,777 --> 01:11:25,154
that John had gotten sick
and died.

1015
01:11:25,281 --> 01:11:26,906
Look, Detective,
l got to be honest with you,

1016
01:11:27,032 --> 01:11:28,908
none of this
makes any sense whatsoever.

1017
01:11:29,034 --> 01:11:30,618
He was a good man.

1018
01:11:30,744 --> 01:11:33,621
Well, as you can see,
there are some...

1019
01:11:33,747 --> 01:11:37,250
discrepancies
we'd like to clear up.

1020
01:11:37,376 --> 01:11:38,459
Now, is there anybody else

1021
01:11:38,585 --> 01:11:42,380
that we can talk to
about your father?

1022
01:11:45,509 --> 01:11:48,177
Come in, Luke.

1023
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:50,555
These gentlemen would like to
talk to you about Dad.

1024
01:11:50,681 --> 01:11:52,557
- That'd be okay?
- Well, yes.

1025
01:11:52,683 --> 01:11:55,310
Mrs. Wakefield,
l'm Detective Tom Adkins

1026
01:11:55,436 --> 01:11:59,105
from the Barnstable
police department.

1027
01:11:59,231 --> 01:12:03,776
l'm sorry to say
l have some terribly sad news.

1028
01:12:03,902 --> 01:12:06,279
We recently found the body
of a young boy

1029
01:12:06,405 --> 01:12:09,240
we believe to be that of-

1030
01:12:09,366 --> 01:12:11,284
of John Wakefield.

1031
01:12:11,410 --> 01:12:14,579
Hmm.

1032
01:12:14,705 --> 01:12:18,249
After all this time.

1033
01:12:18,375 --> 01:12:20,835
Matthew would have been
so relieved.

1034
01:12:20,961 --> 01:12:24,464
His boy John.

1035
01:12:25,758 --> 01:12:27,633
That's how we met.

1036
01:12:31,388 --> 01:12:32,597
- Hey, Sally Ann.
- Hmm?

1037
01:12:32,723 --> 01:12:33,723
lt don't have to be perfect.

1038
01:12:33,849 --> 01:12:35,016
This ain't the Waldorf-Astoria.

1039
01:12:35,142 --> 01:12:36,809
You got that right, Chollie.

1040
01:12:36,935 --> 01:12:38,936
See you tomorrow.

1041
01:12:44,902 --> 01:12:49,030
We're closed.

1042
01:12:54,411 --> 01:12:55,495
Hi.

1043
01:12:55,621 --> 01:12:58,998
Could you spare a coffee?

1044
01:12:59,124 --> 01:13:02,460
Sure.

1045
01:13:02,586 --> 01:13:04,003
Where are your boys?

1046
01:13:22,773 --> 01:13:26,776
lt was very sad, really.

1047
01:13:26,902 --> 01:13:28,069
Yes, ma'am.

1048
01:13:36,578 --> 01:13:37,453
Here.

1049
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:41,290
You passed out in Chollie's.

1050
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:43,626
Where?

1051
01:13:43,752 --> 01:13:45,503
Where am l?

1052
01:13:45,629 --> 01:13:49,132
Well, don't worry,
you'll be fine here.

1053
01:13:51,135 --> 01:13:52,927
I got to get going.

1054
01:13:53,053 --> 01:13:54,303
When's the last time you ate?

1055
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:55,930
I don't know.
lt's not important.

1056
01:13:56,056 --> 01:13:58,724
l'm gonna fix you something.

1057
01:14:01,103 --> 01:14:03,354
How you gonna find your boy
if you don't know where to look?

1058
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:05,857
You got any kids?

1059
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:09,318
No.

1060
01:14:11,655 --> 01:14:13,531
Well, he's my son.

1061
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:19,287
You're in no condition
to find anyone

1062
01:14:19,413 --> 01:14:21,664
until you get
your strength back.

1063
01:14:23,333 --> 01:14:27,170
Matthew left
in a terrible state

1064
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:31,007
from the guilt he felt
for not protecting his son.

1065
01:14:33,051 --> 01:14:36,179
That pain changed him
for some time.

1066
01:14:38,015 --> 01:14:39,640
Everywhere he turned,

1067
01:14:39,766 --> 01:14:43,603
he saw what he didn't have.

1068
01:14:43,729 --> 01:14:44,729
And one night,

1069
01:14:44,855 --> 01:14:48,316
Matthew believed
he could actually get John back.

1070
01:15:10,130 --> 01:15:14,467
Hey!

1071
01:15:14,593 --> 01:15:16,427
John, John.

1072
01:15:16,553 --> 01:15:19,263
John, John.

1073
01:15:44,998 --> 01:15:48,084
Soon after, we went back
to get Mark and Luke

1074
01:15:48,210 --> 01:15:50,211
to start our new lives together.

1075
01:15:51,797 --> 01:15:56,842
But Matthew could never shake
the guilt he felt over John.

1076
01:15:56,969 --> 01:16:00,513
lt was with him
wherever he went.

1077
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:04,392
He was a man
who loved his children,

1078
01:16:04,518 --> 01:16:08,813
and the loss of John
changed him forever.

1079
01:16:13,569 --> 01:16:16,988
Mrs. Wakefield,
did your husband ever...

1080
01:16:17,114 --> 01:16:19,574
talk about any of the other men
he worked with

1081
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:21,325
during his time in Barnstable?

1082
01:16:21,451 --> 01:16:26,831
He only had one friend who
he talked about who helped him.

1083
01:16:26,957 --> 01:16:30,167
And this is him.

1084
01:16:30,294 --> 01:16:34,380
Matthew called him "Diploma."

1085
01:17:08,665 --> 01:17:10,625
Barbara.

1086
01:17:10,751 --> 01:17:13,210
Barb!

1087
01:17:59,925 --> 01:18:04,762
lt was not your fault
Tommy, Jr. went missing.

1088
01:18:08,016 --> 01:18:10,267
Barb left that for you.

1089
01:18:10,394 --> 01:18:12,895
She knew you couldn't let it go.

1090
01:18:18,235 --> 01:18:21,904
There's-there's a lot of good

1091
01:18:22,030 --> 01:18:25,991
that's still left
in your life, Tom.

1092
01:18:30,497 --> 01:18:34,834
She's a good woman.

1093
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:38,379
l don't know how she stayed
with you this long.

1094
01:18:43,593 --> 01:18:47,847
You can't do anything
about losing your son.

1095
01:18:47,973 --> 01:18:52,685
But if you lose your wife,

1096
01:18:52,811 --> 01:18:55,479
<i>that is your fault.</i>

1097
01:19:35,562 --> 01:19:37,855
My best guess
is that it's some sort of toy.

1098
01:19:53,413 --> 01:19:55,206
Russ.

1099
01:19:55,332 --> 01:19:56,707
Let 'em know l'm coming.

1100
01:19:56,833 --> 01:19:59,376
- You better be sure about this.
- I know what l'm doing.

1101
01:19:59,503 --> 01:20:03,005
Yeah, I hope so,
or it's both our asses.

1102
01:20:08,303 --> 01:20:11,222
Remember, Detective Adkins,
Mr. Rogianni is here

1103
01:20:11,348 --> 01:20:13,766
to talk about
a pending investigation.

1104
01:20:13,892 --> 01:20:15,059
There are rules you must follow

1105
01:20:15,185 --> 01:20:17,228
in accordance
with this procedure.

1106
01:20:17,354 --> 01:20:20,064
lf you ask any questions
or make any comments

1107
01:20:20,190 --> 01:20:21,982
regarding
your son's disappearance,

1108
01:20:22,108 --> 01:20:23,901
we walk,

1109
01:20:24,027 --> 01:20:26,445
and we sue.

1110
01:20:58,103 --> 01:21:00,104
Mr. Rogianni,
are you aware that the body

1111
01:21:00,230 --> 01:21:03,607
of a 10-year-old boy
was recently found?

1112
01:21:03,733 --> 01:21:05,025
I heard about it
on the television.

1113
01:21:05,151 --> 01:21:10,447
Could you tell me
where you were spring of 1958?

1114
01:21:10,574 --> 01:21:12,241
Why don't you just go ahead
and ask me

1115
01:21:12,367 --> 01:21:14,159
what it is
you really want to know?

1116
01:21:14,286 --> 01:21:17,288
Just answer his questions
the best you can.

1117
01:21:18,999 --> 01:21:24,753
Again, where were you
in the spring of 1958?

1118
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:29,300
Tell me something.

1119
01:21:29,426 --> 01:21:32,803
All this torturing yourself,

1120
01:21:32,929 --> 01:21:35,514
all those sleepless nights,

1121
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:41,812
all this caging yourself up
till you have nothing left,

1122
01:21:41,938 --> 01:21:43,272
what has it brought you?

1123
01:21:47,611 --> 01:21:50,195
l'm gonna ask you this
one last time.

1124
01:21:52,741 --> 01:21:55,993
Where were you in the spring...

1125
01:21:56,119 --> 01:21:58,120
of 1958?

1126
01:21:59,789 --> 01:22:02,625
That retard's been dead
and buried for 50 years.

1127
01:22:02,751 --> 01:22:04,043
What does that have to do
with me?

1128
01:22:08,465 --> 01:22:11,050
Who said anything
about him being retarded?

1129
01:22:11,176 --> 01:22:14,470
Newspaper, TV, I don't know.

1130
01:22:17,307 --> 01:22:19,767
ln 1958,

1131
01:22:19,893 --> 01:22:22,227
you worked
for Byrnes Contracting.

1132
01:22:22,354 --> 01:22:24,229
You met a man
named Matthew Wakefield.

1133
01:22:24,356 --> 01:22:26,231
You've got nothing.

1134
01:22:26,358 --> 01:22:29,610
Matthew Wakefield had
a 10-year-old son named John.

1135
01:22:34,199 --> 01:22:38,285
Was that your first time,
Mr. Rogianni...

1136
01:22:38,411 --> 01:22:39,620
that you finally figured out
a way

1137
01:22:39,746 --> 01:22:42,998
to lure that little boy
away from his father?

1138
01:22:45,585 --> 01:22:47,878
Was it the first time
you got a taste

1139
01:22:48,004 --> 01:22:51,590
of what it was like
to take a child?

1140
01:22:51,716 --> 01:22:54,301
And was it the first time you-

1141
01:22:54,427 --> 01:22:56,804
you gave out one of these,
Mr. Rogianni?

1142
01:22:58,765 --> 01:23:00,307
Or should I call you Diploma?

1143
01:23:00,433 --> 01:23:01,308
Fuck you.

1144
01:23:01,434 --> 01:23:02,726
Just say it.

1145
01:23:02,852 --> 01:23:05,980
You murdered John Wakefield.

1146
01:23:06,106 --> 01:23:07,231
I don't have to listen
to this.

1147
01:23:07,357 --> 01:23:08,941
You murdered
that innocent little boy...

1148
01:23:09,067 --> 01:23:09,942
Detective.

1149
01:23:10,068 --> 01:23:11,318
And you destroyed
that family.

1150
01:23:11,444 --> 01:23:14,446
You saw a man who was vulnerable
and weak,

1151
01:23:14,572 --> 01:23:15,990
and you destroyed him.

1152
01:23:16,116 --> 01:23:19,576
You took his son away from him
right under his nose.

1153
01:23:19,703 --> 01:23:22,413
That boy should never have
been here in the first place.

1154
01:23:22,539 --> 01:23:24,081
You tell me what you did
to that little boy!

1155
01:23:24,207 --> 01:23:28,961
That boy was
tearing him apart!

1156
01:23:29,087 --> 01:23:31,463
Matthew was my friend.

1157
01:23:35,051 --> 01:23:37,302
l did what he couldn't.

1158
01:23:45,228 --> 01:23:48,647
What about the others?

1159
01:23:48,773 --> 01:23:51,233
You do them a favor too?

1160
01:23:56,573 --> 01:23:58,907
Or did you find
you were beginning to like it?

1161
01:23:59,034 --> 01:24:03,203
There was only one time
l truly enjoyed it.

1162
01:24:14,924 --> 01:24:17,843
There was a little boy...

1163
01:24:17,969 --> 01:24:23,474
who led me to his favorite spot
underneath a tree.

1164
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:27,478
And as we watched the fireworks,

1165
01:24:27,604 --> 01:24:30,314
l snapped his little neck.

1166
01:24:34,819 --> 01:24:36,987
God damn it,
you son of a bitch!

1167
01:24:37,113 --> 01:24:38,322
l'll kill you,
you son of a bitch!

1168
01:24:38,448 --> 01:24:39,823
Come on, get him out of here!

1169
01:24:39,949 --> 01:24:42,159
Get him out of here!
Call the medic!

1170
01:24:42,285 --> 01:24:43,160
Call the medic!

1171
01:25:05,141 --> 01:25:08,519

<i>After a desperate search
for the last 10 years,</i>

1173
01:25:11,564 --> 01:25:14,191
<i>Detective Tom Adkins'
investigation has led him</i>

1174
01:25:14,317 --> 01:25:17,069
<i>to the grim burial site
of his only son.</i>

1175
01:25:24,702 --> 01:25:26,995
<i>For many years
l have dreamt of the moment

1176
01:25:27,122 --> 01:25:29,414
<i>l finally find my son.</i>

1177
01:25:29,541 --> 01:25:33,043
<i>And when you do,
Detective, what then?</i>

1178
01:25:33,169 --> 01:25:34,878
<i>l'm not sure.</i>

1179
01:25:35,004 --> 01:25:38,549
<i>My biggest fear
is that when I do find him,</i>

1180
01:25:38,675 --> 01:25:41,885
<i>what's left of us
may not be enough.</i>

1181
01:25:44,472 --> 01:25:46,140
<i>l haven't been able
to forgive myself,</i>

1182
01:25:46,266 --> 01:25:48,934
<i>and so I push my wife away.</i>

1183
01:25:49,060 --> 01:25:51,103
<i>l can't even look her
in the eyes,</i>

1184
01:25:51,229 --> 01:25:53,272
<i>because every time I do,</i>

1185
01:25:53,398 --> 01:25:54,606
<i>l see my mistakes.</i>

1186
01:25:59,070 --> 01:26:02,573
<i>So I take the risk
of losing everything,</i>

1187
01:26:02,699 --> 01:26:06,827
<i>not because I want to,
but because I have to.</i>

1188
01:26:06,953 --> 01:26:08,787
<i>Only then will I have
the strength</i>

1189
01:26:08,913 --> 01:26:11,415
<i>to go to my wife
and ask her for forgiveness.</i>

1190
01:26:13,668 --> 01:26:17,296
<i>And I have to believe
that one day...</i>

1191
01:26:17,422 --> 01:26:19,506
<i>she will give it to me.</i>
