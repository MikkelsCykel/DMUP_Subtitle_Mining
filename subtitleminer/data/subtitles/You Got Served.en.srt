1
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:40,543
Time.

2
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:53,022
Yeah!
Now, that's what I'm talking about.

3
00:04:54,359 --> 00:04:56,122
Yeah! I like it like this!

4
00:04:56,294 --> 00:04:59,457
These two crews right here
is what I call bad.

5
00:04:59,631 --> 00:05:03,362
I'm talking bad as utter bad.
But it's up to you to decide...

6
00:05:03,535 --> 00:05:07,801
...which crew walks away
with this here $600 in the hat.

7
00:05:11,877 --> 00:05:14,744
Okay, let's settle down!
Let's settle down, now!

8
00:05:14,913 --> 00:05:16,676
Now, by round of applause...

9
00:05:16,848 --> 00:05:19,817
...you decide
who the baddest crew is tonight.

10
00:05:19,985 --> 00:05:21,680
Let's hear it for Vick's crew.

11
00:05:21,853 --> 00:05:23,252
What's up?

12
00:05:23,588 --> 00:05:24,885
Let's go!

13
00:05:28,794 --> 00:05:31,729
All right. Let's hear it
for David and Elgin's crew.

14
00:05:39,437 --> 00:05:44,500
Well, well, well. Seems to me
like the money in the hat goes...

15
00:05:44,676 --> 00:05:47,042
-...to David and Elgin.
-Yeah!

16
00:05:47,679 --> 00:05:49,544
-What you mean?
-Told you, boy!

17
00:05:49,714 --> 00:05:51,739
That's what I'm talking about!

18
00:05:54,286 --> 00:05:57,278
-Vick, y'all did your thing.
-No, that's twisted. We won.

19
00:05:57,455 --> 00:05:59,548
No, no.
Whoa, whoa, now, young blood.

20
00:05:59,724 --> 00:06:02,955
Don't come up in here with all that.
That ain't how it work.

21
00:06:03,128 --> 00:06:04,755
You heard the people. You lost.

22
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:07,524
Now, you don't like the result,
you take yourself...

23
00:06:07,699 --> 00:06:10,133
...you take your little crew,
you get to practicing...

24
00:06:10,302 --> 00:06:13,703
...you bring it back,
we settle it on the floor like men.

25
00:06:13,872 --> 00:06:17,467
-Yeah.
-All right. I want no trouble up in here.

26
00:06:18,577 --> 00:06:21,375
-That's what I'm talking about.
-All right, Mr. Rad.

27
00:06:27,786 --> 00:06:31,847
-Hey. Y'all were off the chain tonight.
-Yeah, y'all really hooked it up.

28
00:06:32,023 --> 00:06:34,116
-Thanks.
-But you're missing one thing.

29
00:06:34,292 --> 00:06:36,590
Really? What's that?

30
00:06:36,761 --> 00:06:40,026
Me and my girl, Toya. She's the bomb.
We wanna get down with y'all.

31
00:06:40,198 --> 00:06:42,393
Yeah, I seen her. She tight.

32
00:06:42,567 --> 00:06:44,592
-So what's your name?
-~Keke.

33
00:06:44,769 --> 00:06:47,966
1 0:00 tomorrow, practice.
I'm gonna check y'all out.

34
00:06:48,139 --> 00:06:49,800
-Cool.
-Thanks.

35
00:06:50,275 --> 00:06:51,833
Anyway....

36
00:07:01,953 --> 00:07:05,514
El, dog, we was on point tonight.
They was feeling us.

37
00:07:06,091 --> 00:07:07,718
I mean, can you imagine...

38
00:07:07,893 --> 00:07:11,124
...when we blow up
and we in front of thousands of fans?

39
00:07:14,933 --> 00:07:17,094
El, what's up with you?

40
00:07:17,269 --> 00:07:20,727
I'm tired of my mom always asking me
what I'm gonna do with my life.

41
00:07:20,906 --> 00:07:24,205
She working double shifts now
because they went up on the rent.

42
00:07:24,376 --> 00:07:26,867
It's messed up,
because Liyah got into Princeton.

43
00:07:27,045 --> 00:07:28,512
That's cool and everything...

44
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,615
...but even with the scholarship,
she can't afford to go.

45
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:35,313
Now she's stuck at L.A. Community
College, working to save up.

46
00:07:35,487 --> 00:07:37,216
This is killing me.

47
00:07:39,658 --> 00:07:42,354
I saw Emerald
on the Shaw last night.

48
00:07:43,028 --> 00:07:45,189
Gotta do what we gotta do.

49
00:07:48,533 --> 00:07:50,592
-Ball up.
-Come on, baby.

50
00:07:53,872 --> 00:07:59,242
-I can't believe we back here, man.
-Me neither, but it's just this once.

51
00:07:59,544 --> 00:08:01,569
-Deal?
-Deal.

52
00:08:01,846 --> 00:08:03,905
All right, let's get up here.

53
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:16,124
So if it isn't
my dancing delivery boys.

54
00:08:16,294 --> 00:08:18,057
I knew you'd be back.

55
00:08:19,664 --> 00:08:21,529
Your timing couldn't
have been better.

56
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,197
My last kid had to retire.

57
00:08:25,437 --> 00:08:27,564
He was running his mouth
too much.

58
00:08:32,577 --> 00:08:34,306
Here.

59
00:08:44,289 --> 00:08:47,554
-Let's hurry up and get this over with.
-We gotta work pretty late.

60
00:08:47,726 --> 00:08:51,492
-You might as well crash at my house.
-Cool. Come on.

61
00:08:56,267 --> 00:08:59,464
Came out here,
You know, he immediately,,,,

62
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,865
Good morning, baby.
Mama's late for work.

63
00:09:04,042 --> 00:09:06,033
David and Elgin are asleep
on the floor.

64
00:09:06,211 --> 00:09:09,180
-David?
-Lord knows what time they got home.

65
00:09:09,347 --> 00:09:11,440
Let them sleep in.
They look tired.

66
00:09:11,616 --> 00:09:14,744
And, Liyah, baby,
make them some breakfast.

67
00:09:21,693 --> 00:09:25,151
It's a gift, You can't work on bouncing
a ball off a guy's head,

68
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:28,163
You're not a kid working on that,
It just comes to you,

69
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,995
He's a freak, a phenom,

70
00:09:31,169 --> 00:09:34,138
He one of the tightest dudes
up there,

71
00:09:34,305 --> 00:09:36,273
Got a lot of crazy moves
with the ball,

72
00:09:36,441 --> 00:09:40,309
It was kind of hard to guard him,
you know what I'm saying? He look--

73
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:48,414
-Hi, David.
-Liyah?

74
00:09:50,055 --> 00:09:52,114
I didn't know where I was
for a minute.

75
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:54,651
Well, sorry for waking you up.

76
00:10:04,969 --> 00:10:07,904
Looks like you could use
a cup of coffee.

77
00:10:09,874 --> 00:10:12,502
So El tells me the crew's
been winning every battle.

78
00:10:12,677 --> 00:10:16,443
You know that's how we do.
When's the last time you saw us?

79
00:10:16,614 --> 00:10:18,741
I'm embarrassed to say.

80
00:10:18,917 --> 00:10:22,045
I think that Christmas you did
the show at the Fox Hills Mall.

81
00:10:22,487 --> 00:10:27,288
-Dang, girl, that's messed up.
-All work and school. No play.

82
00:10:27,459 --> 00:10:29,359
You know how it is.

83
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,133
What?

84
00:10:37,302 --> 00:10:39,395
There's something different
about you.

85
00:10:39,571 --> 00:10:43,735
Well, it's been, what, three years
since y'all moved to Baldwin Hills?

86
00:10:50,381 --> 00:10:51,973
Stop.

87
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,879
You're bugging me out.

88
00:10:55,453 --> 00:10:57,080
Well, I better get to work.

89
00:10:57,255 --> 00:10:59,348
-You want a ride?
-No, I always walk.

90
00:10:59,524 --> 00:11:00,855
I insist. Let me drive.

91
00:11:01,025 --> 00:11:04,085
No, really. I work right down
in South Central Hospital.

92
00:11:04,262 --> 00:11:05,661
It's the only exercise I get.

93
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:09,789
Dang, girl. With a physique like that,
you must walk three, four times a day.

94
00:11:09,968 --> 00:11:12,027
You are so crazy.

95
00:11:12,504 --> 00:11:15,405
-You can walk with me if you'd like.
-Okay.

96
00:11:15,773 --> 00:11:19,539
No, let me.
Let me help you with that.

97
00:11:22,714 --> 00:11:25,148
-David?
-Yeah?

98
00:11:25,316 --> 00:11:27,079
The door?

99
00:11:27,485 --> 00:11:32,422
My bad. Right. My bad.
Come on, girl.

100
00:11:52,343 --> 00:11:53,742
-Hello?
-Where you at?

101
00:11:53,912 --> 00:11:55,777
-Walking to work.
-You seen D?

102
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,207
-Yeah, he's here.
-Put him on the phone.

103
00:11:58,383 --> 00:12:00,112
Here. El wants to talk to you.

104
00:12:00,285 --> 00:12:02,412
-Hello.
-Hey, what you doing with Liyah?

105
00:12:02,587 --> 00:12:05,078
Calm down, man.
I'm just walking her to work.

106
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:07,717
Look, some white kid out
of the County...

107
00:12:07,892 --> 00:12:11,259
...gave me this tape last night
after the show. "Wade" or something.

108
00:12:11,429 --> 00:12:14,330
-You ever heard of him?
-Wade, Wade....

109
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:17,892
Yeah, he got a homeboy named Max.

110
00:12:18,636 --> 00:12:20,627
They competed last summer
in San Diego.

111
00:12:20,805 --> 00:12:22,500
I asked around, and he's paid.

112
00:12:22,674 --> 00:12:24,904
I'm talking cash money,
millionaire paid.

113
00:12:25,076 --> 00:12:28,136
-Why'd he give you the tape?
-I'm waiting to watch with you.

114
00:12:28,313 --> 00:12:30,076
All right, I'm on my way.

115
00:12:30,582 --> 00:12:33,142
-I'm gonna get back.
-Thanks for walking with me.

116
00:12:33,318 --> 00:12:35,445
Maybe I'll see you soon?

117
00:12:41,092 --> 00:12:42,889
What's up, man?

118
00:12:43,194 --> 00:12:44,718
What was you doing with Liyah?

119
00:12:44,896 --> 00:12:47,592
Just talking. It's been a long time.
It ain't nothing.

120
00:12:47,765 --> 00:12:49,858
Yeah, you right.
It better not be nothing.

121
00:12:50,034 --> 00:12:51,934
I'm saying,
you my boy and everything.

122
00:12:52,103 --> 00:12:54,503
When it comes to baby sis,
I will hurt somebody.

123
00:12:54,672 --> 00:12:56,299
Relax.

124
00:12:56,908 --> 00:12:59,900
-What's this?
-This is an official challenge,

125
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:01,670
There's your answer right there.

126
00:13:01,846 --> 00:13:06,374
-This is the real, $5000 challenge,
-Did he just say $5000?

127
00:13:06,551 --> 00:13:08,451
-We got this.
-Y'all put up five grand,,,

128
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:11,851
,,,and we'll put up five grand,
Your crew versus our crew,

129
00:13:12,257 --> 00:13:15,454
-We'll let you pick the place,
-We'll even let you pick the time,

130
00:13:15,627 --> 00:13:18,061
And as much as we don't wanna
take your money,,,

131
00:13:18,229 --> 00:13:20,220
,,,the word is you're the best crew,

132
00:13:20,565 --> 00:13:23,466
We have to show everyone
who the best really is,

133
00:13:24,369 --> 00:13:26,530
-Come on, now.
-We gotta tell the crew.

134
00:13:26,704 --> 00:13:30,868
-We'll tell them tonight after the battle.
-We're about to get this paper, dog.

135
00:14:19,057 --> 00:14:22,618
All right, all right, all right.
That's time.

136
00:14:22,794 --> 00:14:25,592
Time to see which one of these crews
y'all like best.

137
00:14:25,763 --> 00:14:28,095
How about these folks right here?

138
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:37,166
All right, all right, all right.
What about this side here?

139
00:14:37,709 --> 00:14:39,973
What's up?
Take it to that bank!

140
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:47,716
It would seem to me like the money
in the hat would go to your team.

141
00:14:52,724 --> 00:14:55,124
But we have a little situation here.

142
00:14:55,293 --> 00:14:59,093
David and Elgin's crew came up to me
right before this kicked off and said:

143
00:14:59,263 --> 00:15:03,063
"Look here, Mr. Rad. We'd like to
challenge them for double or nothing."

144
00:15:03,434 --> 00:15:05,527
The question is....

145
00:15:06,137 --> 00:15:10,073
Look at me.
The question is, what you gonna do?

146
00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:14,501
Sit down, take your time,
work it out amongst each other.

147
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:17,147
-Chatter, chatter, here we go.
-Let's do it, yo.

148
00:15:17,315 --> 00:15:18,942
Then it's on.

149
00:17:54,037 --> 00:17:55,527
Time!

150
00:17:58,608 --> 00:18:00,337
-That's right! That's right!
-Yeah, boy!

151
00:18:08,784 --> 00:18:11,912
Gather round, gather round.
Come on, come on.

152
00:18:12,722 --> 00:18:14,189
That was hot, man.

153
00:18:14,357 --> 00:18:16,484
Catch up with y'all later.
I got a date.

154
00:18:16,659 --> 00:18:18,286
Rico, we need
a group discussion.

155
00:18:18,461 --> 00:18:22,659
We just got a $5000 challenge from
some rich kid out of Orange County.

156
00:18:23,933 --> 00:18:25,924
Show me the money. What-what!

157
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:29,597
Marty, can you get Oscar
to be down with us?

158
00:18:29,772 --> 00:18:31,171
He don't battle no more.

159
00:18:31,707 --> 00:18:34,175
-You think you could ask anyway?
-Yeah, I'll ask.

160
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:37,308
All right, cool.
Look, this is serious, y'all.

161
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,040
I'm talking practice every day,
even on the weekend.

162
00:18:40,216 --> 00:18:43,185
Y'all gotta be on point.
If y'all ain't down that night...

163
00:18:43,352 --> 00:18:44,785
...you don't get that money.

164
00:18:44,954 --> 00:18:48,048
-We gonna have to put money up?
-Me and D will put up money.

165
00:18:48,224 --> 00:18:51,125
We gonna split 3000
and y'all divvy up the rest. Cool?

166
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,722
-I'm with it.
-I'm down.

167
00:18:52,895 --> 00:18:55,159
Yeah, I'm ready to get pizz-aid!

168
00:18:56,198 --> 00:19:00,032
I'm not with it. I mean, why y'all two
get 1 500 each?

169
00:19:00,202 --> 00:19:02,067
We a crew. Win or lose as a team.

170
00:19:02,238 --> 00:19:03,967
-They're putting the money up.
-True.

171
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:07,473
So? They getting it back.
It's like y'all making money off of us.

172
00:19:07,643 --> 00:19:09,201
Sonny, why you tripping?

173
00:19:09,378 --> 00:19:11,903
We gotta put the money up
to practice in the gym.

174
00:19:12,081 --> 00:19:14,015
I think we should split
the whole 5000.

175
00:19:14,183 --> 00:19:18,449
Then you put up 5000 for the battle.
And when we win, we'll all split it.

176
00:19:19,221 --> 00:19:21,348
-That's what I thought.
-You wanna do this?

177
00:19:21,524 --> 00:19:23,014
-Yeah!
-Let's do it!

178
00:19:23,192 --> 00:19:26,684
All right, I'm about to go get
our winnings from Mr. Rad.

179
00:19:27,663 --> 00:19:29,528
-All right.
-What a night.

180
00:19:29,698 --> 00:19:32,223
-Hey, Rico.
-What's up, Lil Saint?

181
00:19:32,401 --> 00:19:35,564
Y'all was the bomb. When y'all gonna
let me get down with you?

182
00:19:35,738 --> 00:19:37,831
Never, punk. You can't even move.

183
00:19:38,007 --> 00:19:40,999
Rico, why you hang out with this
little thug? He ain't sh--

184
00:19:41,177 --> 00:19:43,202
Look, why don't you mind
your business?

185
00:19:43,379 --> 00:19:46,576
He got everybody hating on him.
It won't happen in front of me.

186
00:19:47,049 --> 00:19:49,711
Sonny, you can't say nothing
about Lil Saint to Rico.

187
00:19:49,885 --> 00:19:52,285
He'll kill somebody over him.

188
00:19:52,455 --> 00:19:54,480
Ric, he worships the ground
you walk on.

189
00:19:54,657 --> 00:19:57,251
But I ain't gonna lie,
he is a little badass.

190
00:19:57,426 --> 00:19:59,724
And he does dance like a white boy.

191
00:19:59,895 --> 00:20:02,728
I'm out of here. Come on, son,
let me take you home.

192
00:20:03,365 --> 00:20:04,627
Who's hungry?

193
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,360
-Let's bounce. Let's bounce.
-I'm hungry.

194
00:20:09,939 --> 00:20:11,736
You know what I mean?

195
00:20:12,108 --> 00:20:15,134
-Man, that battle was crazy.
-All right, cool.

196
00:20:17,113 --> 00:20:19,240
Hi. I told you I would see you soon.

197
00:20:19,415 --> 00:20:21,975
Congratulations.
I was at the battle.

198
00:20:22,151 --> 00:20:24,585
I would have showed off
if I knew you was coming.

199
00:20:24,753 --> 00:20:27,278
Wait, David.
I been knowing you all my life.

200
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:29,621
You think I like you or something?

201
00:20:29,792 --> 00:20:31,726
-No, but--
-Because I do like you.

202
00:20:31,894 --> 00:20:35,159
And the moment you all
have been waiting for.

203
00:20:35,331 --> 00:20:37,458
Beautifull has arrived.

204
00:20:37,867 --> 00:20:39,664
Oh, wait. Hold it.

205
00:20:40,069 --> 00:20:41,934
Is this Mr. Man?

206
00:20:42,404 --> 00:20:44,668
-How you doing?
-Girl. He's hot.

207
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,673
David, this is my crazy best friend,
Beautifull.

208
00:20:47,843 --> 00:20:51,301
And that's with two L's. You got
to accentuate the L's, you know?

209
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,107
Let it roll off your tongue.

210
00:20:53,282 --> 00:20:55,580
-Oh, Beautifull.
-Yes.

211
00:20:55,751 --> 00:20:58,185
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you too.

212
00:20:58,354 --> 00:21:01,448
-Li, what you doing here?
-I got somebody to work for me.

213
00:21:01,624 --> 00:21:05,287
-You shouldn't be missing work.
-You shouldn't be all up in her mix.

214
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:10,660
-Yo, D, we gotta bounce.
-Where you going?

215
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:14,325
-None of your business. Come on.
-All right, see y'all later.

216
00:21:14,837 --> 00:21:16,304
Bye.

217
00:21:18,207 --> 00:21:20,198
Your brother's cute.

218
00:21:26,448 --> 00:21:30,248
-Look, man, this the last time.
-You said that last time.

219
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,308
-Look--
-Whatever. I don't want to hear it.

220
00:22:06,622 --> 00:22:10,080
Y'all put up five grand
and we'll put up five grand,

221
00:22:10,259 --> 00:22:12,318
Your crew versus our crew,

222
00:22:12,494 --> 00:22:14,758
Straight up, We'll let you pick the--

223
00:22:35,184 --> 00:22:36,776
Hey, Rico.

224
00:22:36,986 --> 00:22:39,216
Hey, y'all hold up, all right?

225
00:22:41,757 --> 00:22:45,591
-What up, little man?
-Hey, can I play? Can I play, please?

226
00:22:46,862 --> 00:22:48,921
-Next time.
-Oh, man.

227
00:22:49,098 --> 00:22:52,625
Just go chill. When I'm done,
I'll take you to go get some ice cream.

228
00:22:52,801 --> 00:22:56,532
-All right.
-All right. For sure. Come on, y'all.

229
00:23:05,047 --> 00:23:07,379
-Get it, get it, get it!
-Got him.

230
00:23:21,497 --> 00:23:22,964
-Travel.
-What?

231
00:23:23,132 --> 00:23:25,726
-Travel. What, y'all blind? He traveled.
-Come on...

232
00:23:25,901 --> 00:23:28,563
-...quit crying. This is street ball.
-Still cheating.

233
00:23:28,737 --> 00:23:31,934
When you gonna learn?
Can't battle us on stage or the court.

234
00:23:32,107 --> 00:23:35,099
No matter what, we'll spank you.
We got all this right here.

235
00:23:35,277 --> 00:23:38,110
-All this around here, player.
-Except for the girls.

236
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,510
I was with yours last night.

237
00:23:41,216 --> 00:23:44,845
Ball up. No basket. We going back
this way. Here we go. Come on, y'all.

238
00:23:55,464 --> 00:23:57,694
-Party!
-~Keep the game going. I'll be back.

239
00:23:58,467 --> 00:24:00,196
We were surprised
to hear from you.

240
00:24:00,369 --> 00:24:02,667
-Why?
-Didn't think you were up for a beating.

241
00:24:02,838 --> 00:24:04,863
-We don't get beat.
-Okay.

242
00:24:05,774 --> 00:24:07,469
This should be fun.

243
00:24:07,976 --> 00:24:11,036
Next Saturday night,
the warehouse, 1 1.

244
00:24:11,714 --> 00:24:13,648
-What's so funny?
-Your crew, man.

245
00:24:13,816 --> 00:24:16,376
Y'all need a week?
These kids need a whole week.

246
00:24:16,552 --> 00:24:19,817
To what, practice?
See, my crew, we don't practice.

247
00:24:20,122 --> 00:24:21,521
-We just do it.
-So do we.

248
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:23,214
-So do it.
-Oh, we'll do it.

249
00:24:23,392 --> 00:24:26,259
-Tonight then, baby boy?
-Tonight it's on.

250
00:24:26,428 --> 00:24:28,396
And I ain't your baby boy.

251
00:24:28,564 --> 00:24:32,466
Mr. Rad's warehouse. Y'all suckers
just make sure y'all there by sundown.

252
00:24:32,835 --> 00:24:34,826
Just bring the 5 G's,
all right, man?

253
00:24:35,003 --> 00:24:37,369
That's right.
We'll see who the sucker is.

254
00:24:47,716 --> 00:24:50,617
Hey, yo, D.
Man, I gotta talk to you.

255
00:24:51,019 --> 00:24:52,486
What's up?

256
00:24:54,556 --> 00:24:56,387
What'd you get into?

257
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:00,294
Look, we battling Wade and his crew.
Tonight.

258
00:25:00,462 --> 00:25:02,555
-What?
-Man, they try to clown us, D.

259
00:25:02,731 --> 00:25:03,959
They said we're scared.

260
00:25:04,133 --> 00:25:05,657
-I ain't scared. You?
-Hell, no.

261
00:25:05,834 --> 00:25:08,632
Then what's stopping us
from taking they money tonight?

262
00:25:08,804 --> 00:25:12,365
Nothing. Except we don't
have 5 G's to put up.

263
00:25:16,111 --> 00:25:18,341
I got about 2 G's saved up
from Emerald.

264
00:25:18,514 --> 00:25:21,881
-How much you got?
-About 1 500.

265
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:25,281
Come on, man. You know
I had to hit up the mall, man.

266
00:25:26,789 --> 00:25:30,122
-So we got 3500.
-How we gonna get 1 500 by tonight?

267
00:25:30,826 --> 00:25:33,420
I'll get the money.
You just get the crew together.

268
00:25:33,595 --> 00:25:35,028
You crazy.

269
00:25:35,197 --> 00:25:39,133
-But I always got your back, man.
-For sure.

270
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:42,732
That's what I like.

271
00:25:50,345 --> 00:25:52,711
-Grandma.
-Hey, baby. Grandmama's heart.

272
00:25:52,881 --> 00:25:54,143
Come give me some sugar.

273
00:25:54,316 --> 00:25:57,945
-How you feeling today, Grandma?
-Oh, well....

274
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,948
Got arthritis in my leg.
Threw my back out at bingo...

275
00:26:01,123 --> 00:26:03,387
...because you know when I win,
I do my dance.

276
00:26:03,559 --> 00:26:06,687
Blood pressure's up
and I think I done caught the gout.

277
00:26:06,862 --> 00:26:10,696
But as you know,
I ain't one to complain.

278
00:26:11,733 --> 00:26:14,293
-How are you?
-Okay, I guess.

279
00:26:16,338 --> 00:26:19,603
-What?
-Something's wrong. I feel it.

280
00:26:20,776 --> 00:26:23,074
-You having sex?
-Now, come on, Grandma.

281
00:26:23,245 --> 00:26:24,906
I diapered it.
I can ask about it.

282
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,878
It's nothing like that.
I came by to say hi. That's all.

283
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:30,143
You talk to your grandmama.
Right now.

284
00:26:35,891 --> 00:26:37,859
I need to borrow some money.

285
00:26:38,026 --> 00:26:40,927
Tell me what you need the money for.
And don't lie to me.

286
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:43,489
This crew tried
to chump my crew today.

287
00:26:43,665 --> 00:26:46,896
And I wasn't having it,
so I told them we'll battle tonight.

288
00:26:47,069 --> 00:26:51,062
That's that pride talking.
You got that from your granddaddy.

289
00:26:51,907 --> 00:26:54,375
-How much money you talking about?
-1 500.

290
00:26:54,543 --> 00:26:56,033
That's a lot of money.

291
00:26:56,378 --> 00:26:58,642
Granddaddy also taught me never
to give up.

292
00:26:59,081 --> 00:27:01,208
You're a smooth talker like him too.

293
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:05,217
Well, let me see what I got
in my stash.

294
00:27:11,126 --> 00:27:12,787
These kids sure get crazy.

295
00:27:12,961 --> 00:27:13,128
-Here they come.
-Yeah!

296
00:27:13,128 --> 00:27:14,288
-Here they come.
-Yeah!

297
00:27:14,463 --> 00:27:16,727
I thought you said Sonny
was gonna meet us.

298
00:27:16,899 --> 00:27:19,834
I told him I would pick him up,
but he said he had a ride.

299
00:27:20,002 --> 00:27:23,460
-I'm gonna call him at his house.
-D, man, we can't afford to lose.

300
00:27:23,639 --> 00:27:26,267
We never lose. Why start now?

301
00:27:27,242 --> 00:27:30,234
-Hey, he not picking up.
-He'll be here.

302
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:40,586
-Mr. Rad.
-What you say, young blood?

303
00:27:40,756 --> 00:27:42,485
-How you feeling?
-Good.

304
00:27:42,658 --> 00:27:46,389
It's a beautiful day in Mr. Rad's
neighborhood. It's $5000, man.

305
00:27:46,995 --> 00:27:48,826
Reminds me of the good old days.

306
00:27:48,997 --> 00:27:51,022
We used to race each other
for a quarter.

307
00:27:51,199 --> 00:27:55,932
I win that quarter, we all be down at
the store licking on the same Popsicle.

308
00:27:56,638 --> 00:27:59,266
-Here's the money.
-Well....

309
00:28:00,309 --> 00:28:03,278
Well, this is a little more money
than will fit in my hat...

310
00:28:03,445 --> 00:28:06,812
...so I got a little friend of mine
I'd like for y'all to meet up.

311
00:28:06,982 --> 00:28:08,643
Mr. Chuck.

312
00:28:10,218 --> 00:28:13,619
Mr. Chuck here is L.A.P D.

313
00:28:15,757 --> 00:28:20,751
He's off-duty. He's just here to make
sure that everything goes accordingly.

314
00:28:20,929 --> 00:28:25,730
Mr. Chuck, why don't you show
everybody what you're working with.

315
00:28:26,401 --> 00:28:28,096
Damn.

316
00:28:29,571 --> 00:28:31,061
Everybody good with that?

317
00:28:32,274 --> 00:28:35,107
Fine. Thank you, there, Mr. Chuck.

318
00:28:35,777 --> 00:28:38,143
We'll keep this thing nice,
fair and square.

319
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:42,944
This a lot of money we talking about.
Money ain't the most important thing.

320
00:28:43,552 --> 00:28:47,511
Friendship is the most important thing.
No matter what, win, lose or draw...

321
00:28:47,689 --> 00:28:51,557
...we gonna be friends after this.
There will be no fighting.

322
00:28:51,727 --> 00:28:53,456
We understand each other?

323
00:28:54,863 --> 00:28:56,125
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

324
00:28:56,298 --> 00:28:57,925
All right, let's do this.

325
00:29:01,003 --> 00:29:01,992
Hey, guys, Sonny's here.

326
00:29:02,971 --> 00:29:05,769
-What's up, Sonny?
-Yo, Sonny!

327
00:29:10,445 --> 00:29:11,810
Yo, Sonny, what's up, man?

328
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:14,312
I forgot to tell you.
We got a surprise guest.

329
00:29:21,423 --> 00:29:22,947
Go ahead, David!

330
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:40,769
You peeping this, man?
They're taking all our moves.

331
00:29:43,645 --> 00:29:45,203
That's our move right there.

332
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:50,008
That's your move right there.

333
00:30:14,375 --> 00:30:15,672
What?

334
00:30:23,918 --> 00:30:26,409
-That's your move right there.
-He sold us out.

335
00:30:27,922 --> 00:30:29,685
Sonny sold us out.

336
00:31:07,996 --> 00:31:10,794
You all right?
Look what they're doing to it.

337
00:31:39,961 --> 00:31:41,428
Get back!

338
00:31:41,596 --> 00:31:45,259
What's the matter with you?
I said, in the beginning, no fighting!

339
00:31:45,434 --> 00:31:49,029
You don't come in here with all that!
We gonna do this the right way!

340
00:31:49,204 --> 00:31:52,105
All right, now,
by round of applause.

341
00:32:00,048 --> 00:32:03,415
All right, I've got it.
I said, I got it. I got it!

342
00:32:03,585 --> 00:32:05,177
That's right, baby.

343
00:32:09,191 --> 00:32:11,955
-Let's do this again.
-We'd love to take your money.

344
00:32:12,227 --> 00:32:15,025
-Again.
-Back over there. Get back!

345
00:32:15,197 --> 00:32:17,427
But this ain't fair.
Y'all stole our moves!

346
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:19,499
You just mad.

347
00:32:19,668 --> 00:32:22,159
Because tonight
you suckers got served.

348
00:32:32,247 --> 00:32:35,774
Get your head up.
You lost the money. It's gone.

349
00:32:35,951 --> 00:32:38,215
You can't lay around
in your misery too long.

350
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:42,181
Do not walk out of this place
and start to second-guess your talent.

351
00:32:42,357 --> 00:32:44,052
You got your ass whupped tonight.

352
00:32:44,226 --> 00:32:47,821
But I done seen y'all whup many a ass
right in this same place.

353
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:51,998
Now you lost. Tell you something
my father told me, remember this:

354
00:32:52,167 --> 00:32:56,160
If it don't kill you,
it make you stronger.

355
00:32:59,374 --> 00:33:01,205
I can't take this tonight, man.

356
00:33:01,376 --> 00:33:03,708
El. El.

357
00:33:03,879 --> 00:33:07,280
Sonny gonna get his.
Don't worry about that.

358
00:33:09,151 --> 00:33:10,379
Let's go.

359
00:33:14,256 --> 00:33:17,350
-Tell me last night didn't happen.
-lt happened.

360
00:33:17,526 --> 00:33:21,860
Damn. Tell me Sonny didn't dis us
and Wade didn't play us for $5000.

361
00:33:23,064 --> 00:33:25,055
We can make some
of that back tonight.

362
00:33:25,233 --> 00:33:26,894
Emerald said we could roll.

363
00:33:27,068 --> 00:33:29,559
-That's straight.
-I'm still bugging, though, D.

364
00:33:29,738 --> 00:33:32,070
How the hell we lose 5 G's
in 1 0 minutes, man?

365
00:33:32,641 --> 00:33:36,600
-What was we thinking?
-I just didn't know they were so shady.

366
00:33:37,145 --> 00:33:38,908
Man, I know I didn't.

367
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,412
-Looking for a new man?
-What about your crew?

368
00:33:41,583 --> 00:33:43,448
They don't battle if they don't win.

369
00:33:43,618 --> 00:33:46,746
So what's up, El? D? Can I be down?

370
00:33:46,922 --> 00:33:48,446
Sure, man. Cool, cool.

371
00:33:48,623 --> 00:33:50,181
Yo, ball up.

372
00:33:54,996 --> 00:33:58,693
-D!
-Teams? Y'all not on teams, man.

373
00:33:58,867 --> 00:34:01,427
I'm gonna head out, man.
I gotta do something.

374
00:34:01,603 --> 00:34:04,037
-What time will you swoop me up?
-Meet you there.

375
00:34:04,206 --> 00:34:07,369
I'll meet you there.
I'm always on time. 1 0:00, all right?

376
00:34:07,542 --> 00:34:09,874
-Whatever.
-Hey, could you spot me a 20, dog?

377
00:34:10,045 --> 00:34:11,672
I don't got it.

378
00:34:14,216 --> 00:34:18,209
-Man, all I got is $1 0.
-That's straight. See y'all later, man.

379
00:34:19,621 --> 00:34:21,987
-Let's do it.
-Y'all wanna run threes?

380
00:34:30,765 --> 00:34:33,393
-Who you blowing your horn at?
-Hey.

381
00:34:33,568 --> 00:34:37,129
We are ladies, okay? You are
supposed to say, "Excuse me, miss."

382
00:34:37,305 --> 00:34:39,102
-It's David.
-I know.

383
00:34:39,274 --> 00:34:41,742
Excuse me, miss. How are you today?

384
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:43,468
You see? That was much better.

385
00:34:43,845 --> 00:34:46,507
-What are you doing here?
-I came to pick up my girl.

386
00:34:46,681 --> 00:34:49,149
And you? What you doing here?
Where you going?

387
00:34:49,317 --> 00:34:53,549
-Wherever my man wants to take me.
-Okay, then.

388
00:34:53,955 --> 00:34:56,287
So, Beautifull,
you need us to drop you off?

389
00:34:56,458 --> 00:35:00,588
I push my own wheels.
Thank you. Have fun.

390
00:35:04,366 --> 00:35:05,594
Hello?

391
00:35:05,767 --> 00:35:07,462
Oh, what's up, Rashann?

392
00:35:07,636 --> 00:35:10,503
Yeah. Yeah, man, I'm cool.

393
00:35:10,672 --> 00:35:12,867
Hey, let me call you back,
though, all right?

394
00:35:13,775 --> 00:35:15,208
Sorry.

395
00:35:15,377 --> 00:35:17,436
Everybody still tripping
off the battle.

396
00:35:17,612 --> 00:35:20,274
I hate that I can't do anything
to cheer you up.

397
00:35:21,049 --> 00:35:22,676
No, this is good.

398
00:35:24,786 --> 00:35:26,754
Hello?

399
00:35:27,622 --> 00:35:29,283
What's up, Marty?

400
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:34,324
I'm gonna call you back, all right?

401
00:35:34,896 --> 00:35:36,295
All right.

402
00:35:37,365 --> 00:35:38,764
Now, what were you saying?

403
00:35:38,933 --> 00:35:41,458
Something like
you was all in love with me?

404
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:45,471
-I didn't say that.
-No, but you was thinking that.

405
00:35:53,381 --> 00:35:56,373
-Hold on, hold on.
-Come on, dog!

406
00:35:56,551 --> 00:35:57,813
Damn.

407
00:36:03,058 --> 00:36:06,824
-I need you to come through earlier.
-Earlier? How early?

408
00:36:06,995 --> 00:36:09,122
-Now.
-Now? Come on, I need a minute.

409
00:36:09,297 --> 00:36:13,233
-Want me to give it to somebody else?
-No, no, no. Look, I'll be there.

410
00:36:13,401 --> 00:36:15,096
Just--

411
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:17,197
Hello?

412
00:36:17,372 --> 00:36:19,863
-What's up?
-I gotta get up out of here, Vick.

413
00:36:20,041 --> 00:36:21,872
I'll holler at you later, dog.

414
00:36:22,711 --> 00:36:25,145
Let's go, ball up!

415
00:36:26,748 --> 00:36:29,239
D, come on, man, where you at?

416
00:36:30,852 --> 00:36:32,114
Damn.

417
00:36:40,095 --> 00:36:42,893
-I know you did not turn off my phone.
-Yes, I did.

418
00:36:43,064 --> 00:36:46,295
No more calls.
You're with your boys every day.

419
00:36:46,868 --> 00:36:48,768
And when you're with me...

420
00:36:49,371 --> 00:36:50,929
...you're all mine.

421
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:54,604
I see you got attitude.

422
00:36:54,943 --> 00:36:56,376
I like it.

423
00:37:21,569 --> 00:37:23,799
That's a lot of merchandise, player.

424
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:26,038
We can handle it.

425
00:37:27,108 --> 00:37:30,441
-Where's your partner?
-He gonna meet me at the spot.

426
00:37:59,174 --> 00:38:01,938
Come on, D, pick up, man. Pick up.

427
00:38:04,412 --> 00:38:07,779
Damn. Yo, D, it's El, man.
Where you at? I'm at the spot.

428
00:38:07,949 --> 00:38:09,473
Look, plans got moved up.

429
00:38:09,651 --> 00:38:13,985
Hit me back soon as you get this.
Better yet, just come the hell over!

430
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:20,747
Hey, it's dark outside. What time is it?

431
00:39:21,489 --> 00:39:24,117
I was supposed to hook up
with your brother.

432
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:28,893
Eight messages?
Dang, somebody blowing me up.

433
00:39:29,063 --> 00:39:30,428
It better be your boys.

434
00:39:30,932 --> 00:39:32,297
Hello?

435
00:39:34,802 --> 00:39:36,565
What?

436
00:39:37,105 --> 00:39:38,538
-Who is it?
-ls he all right?

437
00:39:39,274 --> 00:39:41,708
All right, tell him to sit tight.
I'm on my way.

438
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:49,372
-El! El, are you okay?
-Yo, El, we came as soon as we heard.

439
00:39:49,551 --> 00:39:51,246
Oh, so now you want to show up?

440
00:39:51,753 --> 00:39:54,051
Don't say nothing.
I don't want to hear it.

441
00:39:54,389 --> 00:39:57,654
-What happened?
-You left me out hanging, that's what!

442
00:39:57,825 --> 00:40:00,225
Hooking up with my sister
was more important.

443
00:40:00,395 --> 00:40:02,124
-No--
-Shut up, Liyah!

444
00:40:02,764 --> 00:40:04,698
Just so you know...

445
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,331
...we ain't cool.

446
00:40:08,069 --> 00:40:11,163
We ain't boys. We ain't nothing.

447
00:40:11,639 --> 00:40:13,766
I swear you ain't getting
with my sister.

448
00:40:13,942 --> 00:40:17,275
-I turned off his phone.
-I could be dead right now!

449
00:40:17,445 --> 00:40:19,970
You gonna stand in my face
and take up for him?

450
00:40:20,148 --> 00:40:21,911
Go home and stop acting like a ho!

451
00:40:22,083 --> 00:40:24,347
Hey! ~Keep it down.

452
00:40:27,255 --> 00:40:28,984
Don't be talking to her like that.

453
00:40:29,157 --> 00:40:33,116
Whatever I say to her ain't got nothing
to do with you. Get out my face, D!

454
00:40:34,228 --> 00:40:36,992
-You all are gonna have to leave.
-I'm out.

455
00:40:39,801 --> 00:40:41,359
-My man is tripping.
-El is on--

456
00:40:41,536 --> 00:40:43,800
You got busy with his sister
and left him?

457
00:40:43,972 --> 00:40:45,337
I don't roll like that.

458
00:40:45,506 --> 00:40:47,497
I'm sorry, dog, but you do, man.

459
00:40:47,675 --> 00:40:49,973
I mean, you did it with Dawn,
Shandrella...

460
00:40:50,144 --> 00:40:51,668
...and with the triplets--

461
00:40:51,846 --> 00:40:53,677
-You killing me.
-It's true, though.

462
00:40:53,848 --> 00:40:56,316
-You always leave us hanging.
-Not this time.

463
00:40:56,584 --> 00:40:58,211
I wouldn't do it.

464
00:40:58,386 --> 00:40:59,944
And Liyah just ain't some girl.

465
00:41:02,357 --> 00:41:04,621
-I'm out, man. Out.
-D.

466
00:41:35,189 --> 00:41:37,282
Why are you sitting here in the dark?

467
00:41:37,925 --> 00:41:39,517
Thinking.

468
00:41:40,294 --> 00:41:41,955
About what?

469
00:41:42,997 --> 00:41:44,828
About a lot.

470
00:41:46,367 --> 00:41:48,494
I can't play ball.

471
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:51,363
Can't get with my crew.

472
00:41:52,173 --> 00:41:55,870
All because my leg is messed up.
This ain't never gonna be the same.

473
00:41:56,044 --> 00:41:58,171
Sitting in here for three days straight...

474
00:41:58,346 --> 00:42:01,747
...mad at the world
isn't gonna change anything.

475
00:42:04,285 --> 00:42:06,082
And, El...

476
00:42:06,387 --> 00:42:09,413
-...you need to call David.
-I'm caught out because of him.

477
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:11,182
-Why blame him?
-He was hooking up...

478
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:14,351
-...instead of taking care of business.
-But I already told you--

479
00:42:14,962 --> 00:42:18,090
Emerald don't give a damn
about why David didn't show up.

480
00:42:18,733 --> 00:42:21,725
All Emerald cares about
is the stuff that I got jacked for.

481
00:42:23,738 --> 00:42:27,071
Liyah, where am I supposed to get
the money to pay Emerald back?

482
00:42:29,544 --> 00:42:31,808
Maybe David can talk to Emerald.

483
00:42:31,979 --> 00:42:35,574
-He wants to help.
-I don't need nobody to do nothing.

484
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:37,640
I'll handle Emerald.

485
00:42:40,588 --> 00:42:42,556
And how you know
David wants to help?

486
00:42:42,724 --> 00:42:44,351
Didn't I tell you to stay away?

487
00:42:44,525 --> 00:42:46,891
-Elgin, don't start.
-He's playing you, Liyah.

488
00:42:47,495 --> 00:42:49,827
Now, stay away from him.

489
00:43:05,446 --> 00:43:08,643
Yo, D, Lil Saint keep bugging me
about joining the crew.

490
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:11,375
-Little man can't dance.
-I could work with him.

491
00:43:11,586 --> 00:43:13,611
-Or he could be, like, our mascot.
-Yeah.

492
00:43:13,788 --> 00:43:15,619
That's a good idea. What you think?

493
00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:19,123
-I'm cool with that. Call him over.
-Hey, Lil Saint, come here.

494
00:43:22,163 --> 00:43:23,994
-What's up, Ric?
-He is so cute.

495
00:43:24,866 --> 00:43:26,163
You one of us now, Saint.

496
00:43:26,334 --> 00:43:27,926
-Congratulations.
-For real?

497
00:43:28,102 --> 00:43:29,865
That's right. You in the crew now.

498
00:43:30,037 --> 00:43:33,006
Yeah, Rico, I'm just like you now.

499
00:43:33,174 --> 00:43:36,701
You got to keep the deal: no cursing,
hustling, no getting in trouble.

500
00:43:36,878 --> 00:43:39,142
No running with them dudes
you've been with.

501
00:43:39,313 --> 00:43:41,645
Yeah, them dudes
you running with ain't safe.

502
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:45,549
-It's my word.
-Okay. Practice, 6:00 tomorrow.

503
00:43:46,788 --> 00:43:50,383
-All right, boy. Get out of here.
-All right, Saint, man.

504
00:43:50,825 --> 00:43:53,726
-Has anybody talked to El?
-No, he won't accept my calls.

505
00:43:53,895 --> 00:43:56,887
-Mine either.
-I been trying to reach out to him.

506
00:43:57,064 --> 00:43:59,032
Everybody's talking about your beef.

507
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:02,363
Forget that. I'm talking
about your Oscar hookup.

508
00:44:02,804 --> 00:44:06,240
-ls he gonna be down with us?
-He ain't into battles no more.

509
00:44:06,407 --> 00:44:10,468
Man, he's into the pureness of the art.
He's all spiritual and whatnot.

510
00:44:11,512 --> 00:44:13,810
If there's anything we can do
to get him, holler.

511
00:44:14,081 --> 00:44:16,675
I'm about to go shoot some hoops.
You wanna come?

512
00:44:16,851 --> 00:44:18,751
No, I'll catch up with y'all later.

513
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:20,353
-For sure.
-All right, man.

514
00:44:20,521 --> 00:44:22,648
Come on, Saint.

515
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:40,734
-Your boy is really tripping.
-Did you tell him I called?

516
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,736
Yes, but he bugs out
every time I say your name.

517
00:44:45,411 --> 00:44:47,971
We been boys for too long
for it to end like this.

518
00:44:50,616 --> 00:44:53,016
Please don't tell him I told you...

519
00:44:53,452 --> 00:44:54,749
...but El's in trouble.

520
00:44:56,055 --> 00:44:59,218
When the guys jumped him,
they took Emerald's stuff.

521
00:44:59,392 --> 00:45:01,519
I thought it happened
before Emerald's.

522
00:45:02,762 --> 00:45:05,356
-Can you please talk to Emerald?
-Talk?

523
00:45:06,465 --> 00:45:08,365
There ain't no talking to that man.

524
00:45:09,535 --> 00:45:11,400
I gotta help El get this money.

525
00:45:12,305 --> 00:45:14,569
And I was supposed to be with him
that night.

526
00:45:15,975 --> 00:45:18,500
-Liyah, what you doing here?
-Hey, you tripping!

527
00:45:18,911 --> 00:45:20,435
-I'm tired--
-Don't disrespect me!

528
00:45:20,613 --> 00:45:22,979
-You disrespect me by putting your--
-Go home!

529
00:45:24,050 --> 00:45:26,518
-What's wrong with you?
-You lost your mind!

530
00:45:26,686 --> 00:45:28,950
We were trying to figure out how
to help you.

531
00:45:29,121 --> 00:45:31,248
And you come in here and pull this?

532
00:45:31,757 --> 00:45:33,224
Move.

533
00:45:34,093 --> 00:45:35,492
Liyah!

534
00:45:40,066 --> 00:45:40,499
Here you go.

535
00:45:40,499 --> 00:45:41,727
Here you go.

536
00:45:41,901 --> 00:45:45,837
You know what they say.
Hot chocolate make the pain go away.

537
00:45:46,005 --> 00:45:47,472
-Who says that?
-Me.

538
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:51,167
Anything's that hot and chocolate, girl,
you know you can't go wrong.

539
00:45:54,714 --> 00:45:56,978
I can't believe Elgin
put his hands on you.

540
00:45:57,149 --> 00:45:59,413
I would have took my shoe off
and did damage.

541
00:46:00,086 --> 00:46:02,646
-Things are so messed up.
-You think?

542
00:46:03,589 --> 00:46:06,649
There ain't no thinking about it, girl,
you in love.

543
00:46:06,826 --> 00:46:10,694
I mean, David is not like these
other Joes you been kicking it with.

544
00:46:10,863 --> 00:46:14,822
And Beautifull is here
to keep it real with you.

545
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,197
This is that Mary J. Blige, real love.

546
00:46:18,371 --> 00:46:20,339
Remember?
I was like this with my boo.

547
00:46:20,506 --> 00:46:23,100
-You call all of your men boo.
-Russell-boo?

548
00:46:23,275 --> 00:46:25,641
Remember? He was my first love.

549
00:46:25,811 --> 00:46:30,976
Then there was Toby-boo
and now Lamar. He's my boobie-boo.

550
00:46:31,150 --> 00:46:35,849
But what I'm saying is, I know
what real love looks like. Okay?

551
00:46:36,222 --> 00:46:37,655
And you in love, child.

552
00:46:39,125 --> 00:46:40,524
And you know what?

553
00:46:40,693 --> 00:46:43,355
You can stay here
as long as you need to.

554
00:46:43,529 --> 00:46:45,861
You know you my girl
and that I got you.

555
00:46:46,232 --> 00:46:47,961
-Thanks, B.
-You're welcome.

556
00:46:48,667 --> 00:46:51,101
Now, I'm gonna get my makeup kit...

557
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:53,738
...and we gonna have a girls' night,
have some fun.

558
00:47:34,012 --> 00:47:37,004
-I'm gonna get your money soon.
-Shush.

559
00:47:37,182 --> 00:47:40,117
I'm just glad you're alive,
thank the Lord.

560
00:47:40,285 --> 00:47:42,048
-I can't believe--
-Grandma. Hi.

561
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:45,781
Hey, if it ain't my future doctor.
How's school?

562
00:47:45,957 --> 00:47:49,984
Oh, I could have done better
on my exams, but I had a lot going on.

563
00:47:50,161 --> 00:47:51,685
You always make me proud.

564
00:47:52,731 --> 00:47:55,029
I'm worried about you
and your brother.

565
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,964
What's this your mama tells me
about you not speaking?

566
00:47:58,136 --> 00:48:01,936
Look here. Whatever's going on,
I want it to stop right now.

567
00:48:03,308 --> 00:48:06,471
Do you understand? Start talking.

568
00:48:10,048 --> 00:48:11,913
-He hit me.
-No, I didn't!

569
00:48:12,083 --> 00:48:15,018
Have you lost your mind?

570
00:48:15,186 --> 00:48:17,120
You never put your hand
on any woman.

571
00:48:17,288 --> 00:48:19,950
-She better stay away from David.
-I'm gonna see him.

572
00:48:20,258 --> 00:48:22,192
Do it and see what I do to him.

573
00:48:23,628 --> 00:48:25,391
Wait, you know what?

574
00:48:25,563 --> 00:48:25,961
You win, okay?

575
00:48:27,231 --> 00:48:28,664
So I won't see him.

576
00:48:28,833 --> 00:48:30,801
-You happy?
-For sure.

577
00:48:31,569 --> 00:48:32,797
I hate you.

578
00:48:32,970 --> 00:48:34,961
Liyah, baby.

579
00:48:36,107 --> 00:48:38,166
Sit your ass down.

580
00:48:43,414 --> 00:48:45,848
Now, you leave that girl alone.

581
00:48:46,117 --> 00:48:48,745
I'm not telling you
you can't protect your sister.

582
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:52,920
But if she's making a mistake, you got
to let her so she can learn from it.

583
00:48:53,291 --> 00:48:54,519
Do you understand?

584
00:48:58,262 --> 00:49:00,253
I asked you a question.

585
00:49:00,431 --> 00:49:04,367
Elgin Barrett Eugene Smith lll.

586
00:49:04,969 --> 00:49:06,596
Do you hear me?

587
00:49:08,673 --> 00:49:09,901
Yes, ma'am.

588
00:49:12,043 --> 00:49:13,567
Okay, then.

589
00:49:13,878 --> 00:49:15,539
I gotta get going.

590
00:49:16,013 --> 00:49:19,847
Come on and walk an old woman
out to her car.

591
00:49:20,484 --> 00:49:24,420
My feet feel so swollen
it's like walking on water.

592
00:49:25,957 --> 00:49:27,788
Bye, baby.

593
00:49:49,046 --> 00:49:50,877
I heard you got a beat-down.

594
00:49:52,216 --> 00:49:53,706
Yeah, I got jacked.

595
00:49:55,853 --> 00:49:58,651
Look, I was gonna call you
soon as I got your money.

596
00:49:58,823 --> 00:50:01,519
I didn't want to disturb you until then.

597
00:50:01,692 --> 00:50:03,785
I called you 1 0 times...

598
00:50:03,961 --> 00:50:05,428
...and you don't return my call?

599
00:50:05,830 --> 00:50:08,697
-No. I mean, yeah, I was going--
-Now you want to talk?

600
00:50:08,866 --> 00:50:10,857
I didn't tell you to talk!

601
00:50:11,035 --> 00:50:12,866
I'll talk. You listen!

602
00:50:13,938 --> 00:50:18,398
I don't know where you're gonna get
the money from to pay me back.

603
00:50:18,576 --> 00:50:24,446
But I do know you'll make a valiant
effort in that regard. Am I right?

604
00:50:25,182 --> 00:50:26,809
Now you talk.

605
00:50:27,518 --> 00:50:29,418
Right.

606
00:50:30,454 --> 00:50:32,445
I could work it off.

607
00:50:32,623 --> 00:50:35,683
Your days as a courier
for me are over.

608
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:39,261
How do I know you didn't set this up
yourself to get my money?

609
00:50:39,430 --> 00:50:42,490
-Look, I didn't even know--
-Hey, I don't trust nobody!

610
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:47,566
In my eyes, you're guilty
until proven innocent.

611
00:50:48,773 --> 00:50:50,240
I want my money.

612
00:50:52,743 --> 00:50:53,971
You'll get your money.

613
00:50:54,612 --> 00:50:56,204
Now, that's what I wanna hear.

614
00:50:57,748 --> 00:51:01,240
I'll even let you tell me when you can
get me my money.

615
00:51:01,419 --> 00:51:02,716
Six months?

616
00:51:09,794 --> 00:51:11,728
I usually say 24 hours.

617
00:51:12,797 --> 00:51:15,857
But since your partner called me
and begged me...

618
00:51:16,033 --> 00:51:18,467
...to leave you in one piece...

619
00:51:18,636 --> 00:51:20,729
...I'm gonna give you a few weeks.

620
00:51:21,505 --> 00:51:23,200
Don't play me, El.

621
00:51:23,374 --> 00:51:25,740
You do...

622
00:51:28,279 --> 00:51:30,372
...you'll never walk...

623
00:51:30,548 --> 00:51:33,517
...Iet alone dance, again.

624
00:51:34,018 --> 00:51:36,578
Now, excuse yourself.

625
00:52:03,881 --> 00:52:06,008
Yo, D!

626
00:52:06,183 --> 00:52:08,481
Marty, work with them.

627
00:52:08,953 --> 00:52:11,148
What's up, man?

628
00:52:11,622 --> 00:52:13,988
Your new crew's wack!
Where did you get them?

629
00:52:14,158 --> 00:52:18,527
-Why you busting my crew out, man?
-Go sit down.

630
00:52:19,130 --> 00:52:22,531
Hey, Ric, man, you taking
this loyalty thing a little too far.

631
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:26,636
I mean, if you got down with me
and Marty, El won't care. I need you.

632
00:52:26,804 --> 00:52:28,540
We'll be up against another crew
in a few days.

633
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:29,131
We'll be up against another crew
in a few days.

634
00:52:29,307 --> 00:52:30,535
Wanna make some money?

635
00:52:30,708 --> 00:52:33,609
I'm always down to make money,
but I can't.

636
00:52:33,778 --> 00:52:36,144
I saw El the other day.
He got a new crew too.

637
00:52:36,548 --> 00:52:39,813
-Word?
-Yeah, and I'll tell you like I told him.

638
00:52:39,984 --> 00:52:41,576
It just don't feel right.

639
00:52:41,753 --> 00:52:45,154
You and El is like Shaq and ~Kobe.
Together y'all do damage.

640
00:52:45,323 --> 00:52:47,917
It ain't the same
when one's not in the game.

641
00:52:48,092 --> 00:52:51,528
Look, y'all both my boys, but if I can't
never get the old crew back...

642
00:52:51,696 --> 00:52:54,358
...me and Saint just might have
to do our own thing.

643
00:52:54,532 --> 00:52:55,931
The way El's acting...

644
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:58,796
...I don't think we
ever gonna be cool.

645
00:52:58,970 --> 00:53:01,336
Look, man, let me get back.
All right?

646
00:53:02,607 --> 00:53:03,835
Yo, Saint, let's roll.

647
00:55:28,086 --> 00:55:31,146
You and me.
Right now. Look, look.

648
00:55:33,024 --> 00:55:35,356
That ain't even cool, man.

649
00:55:35,526 --> 00:55:37,426
It don't matter.

650
00:55:37,595 --> 00:55:39,859
Let's bounce.

651
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:50,868
Yo, D.

652
00:55:51,042 --> 00:55:52,737
-What's up, Ric?
-What's up, player?

653
00:55:52,910 --> 00:55:55,538
Chilling. That jersey's tight.
Where'd you get that?

654
00:55:55,713 --> 00:55:56,941
Rico got it for me.

655
00:55:57,115 --> 00:56:00,380
-Rico take good care of you, don't he?
-Yep.

656
00:56:04,455 --> 00:56:06,116
Watch out, man.

657
00:56:06,758 --> 00:56:09,090
I ain't gonna have much more
of you swinging.

658
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:13,287
-lf you hadn't left him out in the cold--
-I didn't. This between me and my boy.

659
00:56:13,464 --> 00:56:15,056
-He ain't your boy.
-Chill, Vick.

660
00:56:15,233 --> 00:56:17,531
-Why you trying to start?
-What you wanna do?

661
00:56:17,702 --> 00:56:20,728
-Yeah, what you wanna do?
-Hold up. This ain't going down.

662
00:56:21,239 --> 00:56:22,934
Y'all mad at the wrong people.

663
00:56:23,107 --> 00:56:25,871
Y'all need to throw that hate
towards Wade and them.

664
00:56:26,711 --> 00:56:30,078
All I'm saying is, you need to find
the love again, because this...

665
00:56:30,248 --> 00:56:31,613
...it ain't right.

666
00:56:31,783 --> 00:56:34,843
-Come on, Saint. We out.
-Yeah, we out.

667
00:56:55,606 --> 00:56:57,335
-What's up, Ric?
-The Big Bounce...

668
00:56:57,508 --> 00:56:59,942
...that's what's up.
Check this out. Read this.

669
00:57:00,344 --> 00:57:01,572
Fifty thousand dollars?

670
00:57:01,746 --> 00:57:03,941
Yes, man. Enough money
to change our lives.

671
00:57:04,115 --> 00:57:06,242
Look, a chance to be
in a music video.

672
00:57:06,417 --> 00:57:08,442
I'm talking putting some kids
on the map.

673
00:57:08,619 --> 00:57:10,644
-And getting paid.
-Yes, man, it's ours.

674
00:57:10,822 --> 00:57:12,346
Tailor-made for us, El.

675
00:57:12,523 --> 00:57:14,457
I been praying
for something like this.

676
00:57:17,595 --> 00:57:19,859
I owe Emerald a lot of money, man.

677
00:57:20,031 --> 00:57:22,363
And this could be my only way
to pay him back.

678
00:57:22,533 --> 00:57:24,660
And I could pay
my grandmama back.

679
00:57:24,836 --> 00:57:26,303
Man, I gotta win.

680
00:57:26,470 --> 00:57:28,165
Yeah, we can win.

681
00:57:28,339 --> 00:57:31,570
-But you gotta get David in--
-Ain't no David, man.

682
00:57:32,276 --> 00:57:33,868
Think Wade's crew gonna get in?

683
00:57:34,045 --> 00:57:37,208
You know it. They already saying
the Big Bounce is theirs.

684
00:57:37,381 --> 00:57:39,178
No, not this time.

685
00:57:39,817 --> 00:57:41,910
Wade ain't getting this.
This is mine.

686
00:57:43,888 --> 00:57:46,948
-Fifty thousand dollars?
-And a shot to rock a music video.

687
00:57:47,124 --> 00:57:48,785
We gotta do it with the old crew.

688
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:51,690
-Rashann, Saint, El--
-What?

689
00:57:51,863 --> 00:57:54,058
No, man.
I'm tired of El dissing me.

690
00:57:54,232 --> 00:57:57,793
I'm gonna win this money, then break
him off some so I don't owe him.

691
00:57:57,969 --> 00:58:02,406
But that's just the way that story ends.
I'll catch up with you. 50,000!

692
00:59:48,145 --> 00:59:50,238
Hey, what's up, y'all?
I'm La La from MTV...

693
00:59:50,414 --> 00:59:52,848
...and I'm chilling
at the L.A. Convention Center...

694
00:59:53,017 --> 00:59:56,316
...in sunny Southern California.
I'm surrounded by crews.

695
00:59:56,620 --> 00:59:59,953
It is the semifinals
of the Big Bounce competition.

696
01:00:00,191 --> 01:00:02,557
It has been off the hook
for real, for real...

697
01:00:02,727 --> 01:00:05,696
...and I'm gonna keep you updated
on what's going down.

698
01:00:31,088 --> 01:00:34,148
Mr. Rad, come here. I want you
to meet my friend, Beautifull.

699
01:00:34,325 --> 01:00:37,624
-Hey, Beautiful.
-That's Beautifull with two L's.

700
01:00:38,596 --> 01:00:39,824
Nice to meet you.

701
01:00:41,365 --> 01:00:43,799
So, what's going on
with David and Elgin out here?

702
01:00:44,135 --> 01:00:47,468
I been trying to talk to these two.
I can't seem to get through.

703
01:00:47,638 --> 01:00:50,004
They need to stop
all this messing around.

704
01:00:52,209 --> 01:00:54,803
Wait a minute,
are y'all feeling this right now?

705
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:59,847
I'm talking about the hottest crews
from Los Angeles, California...

706
01:01:00,017 --> 01:01:03,248
...competing for $50,000!

707
01:01:03,421 --> 01:01:06,356
Do y'all hear me? $50,000 for real!

708
01:01:12,763 --> 01:01:14,993
Mr. Rad, I'm really worried
about Elgin.

709
01:01:15,332 --> 01:01:19,029
Liyah, I've known you kids around
this neighborhood all your life.

710
01:01:19,203 --> 01:01:22,832
There's one person that you can
talk to around here, that's Mr. Rad.

711
01:01:23,007 --> 01:01:24,565
Now, come on.

712
01:01:25,076 --> 01:01:27,408
Elgin owes Emerald
a lot of money and--

713
01:01:27,578 --> 01:01:31,105
Ain't nothing to worry yourself about.
I done took care of that.

714
01:01:31,482 --> 01:01:33,643
-But how--?
-I got a friend, Mr. Chuck...

715
01:01:33,818 --> 01:01:37,219
...and neither David nor Elgin
have anything to worry about.

716
01:01:37,755 --> 01:01:40,223
Let's just say...

717
01:01:40,391 --> 01:01:44,191
...that Mr. Emerald has had
what they call a little change of heart.

718
01:01:44,762 --> 01:01:48,027
-But how did you know--?
-Mr. Rad knows everything...

719
01:01:48,199 --> 01:01:51,191
...that goes down
in Mr. Rad's neighborhood.

720
01:01:51,368 --> 01:01:54,667
-And I took care of that.
-Thank you.

721
01:01:55,339 --> 01:01:58,467
We should tell David and Elgin.
They're freaked out about it.

722
01:01:58,642 --> 01:02:02,203
Oh, no, no, no. Let's just let them
keep on freaking out.

723
01:02:02,379 --> 01:02:05,212
That'll be good.
Might get some sense into their heads.

724
01:02:05,382 --> 01:02:09,751
Because if they don't pull it together,
little Wade or whatever his name is...

725
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:12,445
...he'll walk away
with this money again for sure.

726
01:02:52,096 --> 01:02:54,690
Here's the deal.
1 0 crews were in the house today...

727
01:02:54,865 --> 01:02:57,993
...but only five are gonna make it
to the finals tomorrow.

728
01:02:58,169 --> 01:03:00,137
And the winners are gonna appear...

729
01:03:00,304 --> 01:03:06,038
...in multi-platinum recording artist--
Y'all ain't ready. Lil' ~Kim's video.

730
01:03:10,014 --> 01:03:11,811
There go Dave's crew right there.

731
01:03:13,684 --> 01:03:15,049
Let's go, D!

732
01:04:06,203 --> 01:04:07,693
That's a damn shame.

733
01:04:09,373 --> 01:04:11,967
Where your boy Saint?
Ain't he supposed to be here?

734
01:04:12,142 --> 01:04:13,973
He, like, the little mascot,
ain't he?

735
01:04:14,144 --> 01:04:16,772
Yeah, for sure,
but I ain't seen him all day.

736
01:05:28,952 --> 01:05:32,945
Man! I'm La La. I'll be back tomorrow
for the finals, so stay tuned.

737
01:05:38,495 --> 01:05:42,431
-I knew you'd be here.
-What's up, stranger?

738
01:05:42,599 --> 01:05:45,432
So is there any brains on that menu
or common sense...

739
01:05:45,602 --> 01:05:47,001
-...you can order?
-Not now.

740
01:05:47,171 --> 01:05:51,335
When? Someone needs to let him and
El know how ridiculous they're being.

741
01:05:51,508 --> 01:05:54,568
I'm gonna get with a crew myself
and make me a video...

742
01:05:54,745 --> 01:05:56,110
-...and get some money.
-B?

743
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:59,716
-What?
-Can you give us a minute, please?

744
01:05:59,983 --> 01:06:02,417
You want me to go sit
at a table by myself...

745
01:06:02,586 --> 01:06:03,917
...Iooking all lonely?

746
01:06:04,088 --> 01:06:06,181
Yes. I'll be over there soon.

747
01:06:07,458 --> 01:06:08,891
Fine.

748
01:06:11,195 --> 01:06:13,322
I came here to make sure
you were okay.

749
01:06:15,299 --> 01:06:18,132
I'd be a lot better if we were together.

750
01:06:20,170 --> 01:06:22,798
Look, I'm not trying to stress you.

751
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:25,508
My crew lost to El.

752
01:06:27,277 --> 01:06:30,940
Even with all our drama,
something in me was cool with it.

753
01:06:31,882 --> 01:06:33,577
I hope he wins.

754
01:06:33,751 --> 01:06:35,343
I know he needs it.

755
01:06:35,519 --> 01:06:37,919
-You seen Rico?
-I think he's with El and Vick.

756
01:06:38,088 --> 01:06:40,352
We got to find Ric. Saint got shot.

757
01:06:40,524 --> 01:06:42,116
-What?
-My God! What happened?

758
01:06:42,292 --> 01:06:44,988
He was with Lanky and Bug
and some dude sprayed the car.

759
01:06:45,162 --> 01:06:46,390
-How is he?
-ls he okay?

760
01:06:46,563 --> 01:06:49,589
I heard he got hit twice,
but the hospital's giving no info.

761
01:06:49,767 --> 01:06:51,496
-We gotta find Ric.
-I'm going.

762
01:06:51,668 --> 01:06:55,104
No. I don't feel like dealing
with your brother, okay? Trust me.

763
01:07:00,077 --> 01:07:01,840
Miss, I'm looking for my brother.

764
01:07:02,012 --> 01:07:03,775
-What's his name?
-Teshawn Miller.

765
01:07:03,947 --> 01:07:06,643
-We call him Lil Saint.
-Yeah.

766
01:07:07,985 --> 01:07:09,976
Teshawn's family left
about an hour ago.

767
01:07:10,154 --> 01:07:13,180
He's not my brother,
but blood couldn't make us any closer.

768
01:07:13,357 --> 01:07:16,383
-We need to see him, okay?
-You wait in the waiting room.

769
01:07:17,628 --> 01:07:19,186
Come on, y'all.

770
01:07:23,567 --> 01:07:25,762
-How's Saint?
-Did you see him yet?

771
01:07:25,936 --> 01:07:27,767
-Not yet.
-There anything we can do?

772
01:07:27,938 --> 01:07:29,565
No. We just wanna see Saint.

773
01:07:31,909 --> 01:07:33,570
We're waiting to see Teshawn.

774
01:07:34,845 --> 01:07:37,973
~Kids, I think you should talk
to Teshawn's family.

775
01:07:38,148 --> 01:07:40,878
Doc, no disrespect,
but we are Teshawn's family.

776
01:07:41,452 --> 01:07:42,942
All right?

777
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:45,588
-I can appreciate that, but--
-But what?

778
01:07:46,256 --> 01:07:49,282
What, do you want it in writing?
What do I have to tell you?

779
01:07:49,693 --> 01:07:53,390
I mean, he eats in my crib, I buy him
clothes, I keep him out of trouble.

780
01:07:53,564 --> 01:07:55,759
I'm closer to that kid than anybody.

781
01:07:56,767 --> 01:08:00,259
Just let me go in, all right?
I just wanna let him know I'm here.

782
01:08:00,704 --> 01:08:02,103
I know he's looking for me.

783
01:08:02,272 --> 01:08:05,730
Look, we'll all wait out here
if you could just let Rico go in, Doc.

784
01:08:05,909 --> 01:08:07,638
Please.

785
01:08:08,946 --> 01:08:11,437
Look, I'm sorry
to have to tell you this...

786
01:08:13,016 --> 01:08:15,109
...but Teshawn died a few hours ago.

787
01:08:15,352 --> 01:08:16,876
-What?
-A bullet...

788
01:08:17,054 --> 01:08:20,251
...pierced his lung and caused
severe internal bleeding.

789
01:08:20,424 --> 01:08:23,018
We tried to contain it.
We tried to revive him.

790
01:08:24,761 --> 01:08:26,752
He didn't come back.

791
01:08:26,930 --> 01:08:29,490
There's nothing more we could do.

792
01:08:30,133 --> 01:08:32,328
I'm so sorry.

793
01:08:34,505 --> 01:08:37,440
No, man! Just let me go!

794
01:09:03,700 --> 01:09:05,429
-What's up, Ric?
-What's up?

795
01:09:05,602 --> 01:09:09,003
-How you holding up, man?
-I'm all right.

796
01:09:09,172 --> 01:09:10,833
El, I been thinking, though.

797
01:09:11,008 --> 01:09:14,739
I was always going on to Lil Saint
about how important friendship is...

798
01:09:14,912 --> 01:09:17,642
...and how you gotta look out
for family and friends.

799
01:09:17,814 --> 01:09:19,611
You know what he would say?

800
01:09:19,783 --> 01:09:22,547
He said, "Like Elgin and David do?"

801
01:09:24,655 --> 01:09:26,782
El, I wanna be in the competition.

802
01:09:26,957 --> 01:09:28,891
You can get down with me
and my crew.

803
01:09:29,059 --> 01:09:31,357
I don't wanna just get down,
I wanna win.

804
01:09:31,528 --> 01:09:33,758
That's what I'm saying.
We'll get this paper.

805
01:09:33,931 --> 01:09:35,956
It's about more than money.

806
01:09:36,133 --> 01:09:39,625
Look, I wanna be the man
Lil Saint thought I was.

807
01:09:39,803 --> 01:09:44,263
Hasn't losing Lil Saint made you
realize life is too short for all of this?

808
01:09:44,441 --> 01:09:46,102
We need David to do it as a team.

809
01:09:46,276 --> 01:09:48,540
-Look, we don't have David.
-You could.

810
01:09:48,712 --> 01:09:51,613
I told him to come over here
so I could talk to him.

811
01:09:51,782 --> 01:09:54,444
-I said you were at Grandma's.
-You and Ric set me up?

812
01:09:54,618 --> 01:09:58,679
Look, you call it what you want, man,
but we need to end this now.

813
01:10:04,428 --> 01:10:05,759
-Hey, D.
-What's up?

814
01:10:05,929 --> 01:10:07,396
-What's up, Ric?
-What's up?

815
01:10:07,564 --> 01:10:11,364
I stopped by Lil Saint's mom's earlier.
She not doing too good.

816
01:10:11,535 --> 01:10:13,901
I know. I just came from there.

817
01:10:14,905 --> 01:10:16,099
Why am I here?

818
01:10:16,273 --> 01:10:18,264
We want you and El
to stop the madness.

819
01:10:19,009 --> 01:10:22,536
El, I wish you the best of luck,
all right, bro?

820
01:10:22,713 --> 01:10:24,908
Stop being so stubborn
and at least listen!

821
01:10:25,082 --> 01:10:27,482
Ain't nothing to talk about.
Ain't gonna happen.

822
01:10:27,651 --> 01:10:30,950
This feud is stupid, selfish
and it affects a lot of people.

823
01:10:32,255 --> 01:10:34,951
Rico and the crew
have been down with y'all for years.

824
01:10:35,125 --> 01:10:38,617
Don't they deserve the chance
to win this competition?

825
01:10:38,795 --> 01:10:41,593
And you're always talking
about how you'll help Mama.

826
01:10:41,765 --> 01:10:44,063
If you win this, you could help her.

827
01:10:46,670 --> 01:10:50,504
You're not gonna win this competition
without David and you know it.

828
01:10:50,674 --> 01:10:54,508
Come on, y'all, let's just do it for
Lil Saint. I mean, he loved the crew.

829
01:10:54,678 --> 01:10:57,169
If he'd been in the battle
with one of y'all crews...

830
01:10:57,347 --> 01:11:00,475
...he wouldn't have been in that car.
He'd be here right now.

831
01:11:02,619 --> 01:11:05,645
But the rules say
the crews are locked down.

832
01:11:06,189 --> 01:11:09,317
And you gotta compete
with whatever crew you started with.

833
01:11:09,493 --> 01:11:10,858
Dang, that's messed up.

834
01:11:11,228 --> 01:11:12,786
Look, I'm sorry, Ric.

835
01:11:12,963 --> 01:11:15,864
David ain't getting down with my crew
no matter what.

836
01:11:18,568 --> 01:11:21,036
Wish your brother good luck for me.

837
01:11:37,554 --> 01:11:40,523
What's up, what's up? This is La La
from MTV. Check it out.

838
01:11:40,691 --> 01:11:43,558
Do you see all these people?
This is not a joke.

839
01:11:43,727 --> 01:11:47,322
It is day two, the finals
of the Big Bounce Competition.

840
01:11:47,497 --> 01:11:50,261
Five of the dopest crews are left
and only one crew...

841
01:11:50,434 --> 01:11:52,800
...is going home $50,000 richer...

842
01:11:52,969 --> 01:11:56,461
...and only one crew is gonna get
to appear in Lil' ~Kim's new video.

843
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:58,574
Hey, guys, look what we have here.

844
01:11:58,975 --> 01:12:00,169
Whatever.

845
01:12:00,343 --> 01:12:02,208
Gonna use them tired-ass
moves again?

846
01:12:02,379 --> 01:12:05,678
You funny now, but you won't be
when we get on the floor.

847
01:12:05,849 --> 01:12:07,874
Yeah, we'll see who gets
the last laugh.

848
01:12:08,051 --> 01:12:11,214
Do you think you know who's gonna
be the hottest crew in Cali?

849
01:12:11,388 --> 01:12:13,720
You gotta stay tuned
right here to find out.

850
01:12:22,399 --> 01:12:24,560
-What's up, Vick?
-What's up, El?

851
01:12:25,202 --> 01:12:27,568
She just needed the official name
for the crew.

852
01:12:27,738 --> 01:12:30,002
-What did you tell her?
-We gotta get busy.

853
01:12:30,173 --> 01:12:31,868
-Where the kneepads?
-Right here.

854
01:12:32,042 --> 01:12:33,509
-Y'all ready?
-Look at this.

855
01:12:33,677 --> 01:12:35,508
-All right.
-All right. You ready?

856
01:12:35,679 --> 01:12:37,237
Sure, I'm ready.

857
01:12:38,381 --> 01:12:40,349
Yeah!

858
01:12:43,620 --> 01:12:44,917
Make some noise!

859
01:12:48,125 --> 01:12:51,788
Ladies and gentlemen.
Man, y'all are in for a treat.

860
01:12:52,395 --> 01:12:56,263
Whichever crew wins today, you're
gonna wanna remember their faces...

861
01:12:56,433 --> 01:12:59,960
...because the next time you'll see
them will be Lil' ~Kim's new video.

862
01:13:00,137 --> 01:13:02,298
Give it up for Lil' ~Kim!

863
01:13:06,543 --> 01:13:12,413
Now, for those of you who don't know,
my name's Wade Robson.

864
01:13:13,717 --> 01:13:15,378
Thank you.

865
01:13:16,119 --> 01:13:19,850
Now, I've choreographed some
of the hottest videos ever to hit MTV.

866
01:13:20,023 --> 01:13:23,754
I've worked with artists such as
Britney Spears, *NSYNC...

867
01:13:23,927 --> 01:13:25,861
-...Pink, Mya...
-He's so cute!

868
01:13:26,029 --> 01:13:27,894
-...Usher...
-He tight!

869
01:13:28,064 --> 01:13:30,032
...but I've never seen anything...

870
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:32,430
...Iike what these crews
have done here.

871
01:13:32,602 --> 01:13:35,503
So I want y'all to give it up
for Wade's Crew.

872
01:13:40,677 --> 01:13:43,237
Settle down, settle down,
settle down, settle down.

873
01:13:44,748 --> 01:13:47,911
All right, next up,
we got Bug and His Boys.

874
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:52,511
We got the Furious Females!

875
01:13:55,258 --> 01:13:57,522
The Pomona Pit Bulls!

876
01:13:58,128 --> 01:14:00,619
Last but not least,
the Lil Saints.

877
01:14:08,371 --> 01:14:10,805
So without further ado...

878
01:14:10,973 --> 01:14:13,840
...Iadies and gentleman,
it's showtime!

879
01:14:18,781 --> 01:14:21,750
Yo, yo, yo, this is wild.
This is the bomb!

880
01:14:21,918 --> 01:14:24,148
It's about to get crazy
up in here!

881
01:15:21,911 --> 01:15:25,244
Now, this right here
is what I call a real competition.

882
01:15:25,414 --> 01:15:27,905
I'm so glad
I'm not one of those judges.

883
01:15:28,083 --> 01:15:30,051
This is gonna be
a really tough call.

884
01:16:37,253 --> 01:16:39,118
Settle down, settle down.

885
01:16:39,588 --> 01:16:42,421
Man, this is gonna be
a really tough decision.

886
01:16:42,591 --> 01:16:45,025
All the crews were incredible, right?

887
01:16:48,030 --> 01:16:49,930
Give them some love!
They deserve it.

888
01:16:50,866 --> 01:16:52,663
Let's see what the judges think.

889
01:17:02,278 --> 01:17:04,303
That's ridiculous.
You can't do that.

890
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:06,539
What is this?

891
01:17:09,585 --> 01:17:10,813
All right, everybody.

892
01:17:11,420 --> 01:17:12,751
Listen up.

893
01:17:12,922 --> 01:17:14,822
All the crews were hot.

894
01:17:15,157 --> 01:17:16,556
They all did their thing.

895
01:17:16,725 --> 01:17:19,193
But looks like we've got
ourselves a tie.

896
01:17:25,668 --> 01:17:27,693
Well, the winners are...

897
01:17:27,870 --> 01:17:29,303
...both Wade's Crew...

898
01:17:29,471 --> 01:17:31,598
...and the Lil Saints.

899
01:17:34,944 --> 01:17:37,538
That's wack.
We ain't tied with these busters.

900
01:17:37,713 --> 01:17:39,908
You're right,
because we're better than you.

901
01:17:40,082 --> 01:17:41,845
Man, better than you'll ever be.

902
01:17:46,055 --> 01:17:47,522
Look, listen to me.

903
01:17:47,756 --> 01:17:50,316
You cannot do this to these boys.

904
01:17:50,492 --> 01:17:53,518
This ain't just a prize to them.
This is bigger than that.

905
01:17:53,696 --> 01:17:57,291
This is Tyson and Holyfield to them.
You gotta pick a winner.

906
01:17:57,466 --> 01:17:58,660
He's right.

907
01:17:58,834 --> 01:18:03,203
-But what do you want me to do?
-These dudes are gonna fight.

908
01:18:03,806 --> 01:18:05,831
What did I tell you?
Get over there!

909
01:18:07,343 --> 01:18:10,210
Wait a minute!
What's the matter with you?

910
01:18:10,379 --> 01:18:11,812
Look...

911
01:18:11,981 --> 01:18:16,077
...Little Miss ~Kim, trust me on this.
You have to let these boys battle it out.

912
01:18:16,251 --> 01:18:19,118
Listen, this how it work.
This is crew against crew.

913
01:18:19,288 --> 01:18:21,017
Just like we do it on the streets.

914
01:18:22,291 --> 01:18:24,555
-Streets?
-Just like that.

915
01:18:25,361 --> 01:18:26,794
See, now you're talking.

916
01:18:26,962 --> 01:18:28,793
-That what I'm talking about.
-Yeah.

917
01:18:29,398 --> 01:18:31,059
All right, everybody.

918
01:18:31,233 --> 01:18:33,599
We decided to take it to the streets!

919
01:18:39,875 --> 01:18:44,039
These two crews are gonna battle
it out for you, straight street-style.

920
01:18:49,184 --> 01:18:50,879
Listen up...

921
01:18:51,053 --> 01:18:52,611
...y'all tear this mother up.

922
01:18:52,788 --> 01:18:54,756
Get grimy and dirty.

923
01:18:55,724 --> 01:18:57,555
Straight street.

924
01:18:57,726 --> 01:19:01,355
-How street you want us to get?
-You know how I like it, baby.

925
01:19:01,530 --> 01:19:02,758
Straight hood.

926
01:19:03,232 --> 01:19:04,426
No rules?

927
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:07,899
Hell, no. Just do the damn thing.
No rules.

928
01:19:09,905 --> 01:19:13,898
-So y'all adding people to the party?
-What, you got a problem with it?

929
01:19:14,076 --> 01:19:17,102
I'm cool. Remember, no rules.

930
01:19:19,415 --> 01:19:21,576
Let's do this!

931
01:19:34,263 --> 01:19:36,788
Hey, Oscar, what's up, man?
Thanks for coming.

932
01:19:36,965 --> 01:19:39,900
-Thought you don't battle no more.
-This isn't about that.

933
01:19:40,069 --> 01:19:42,629
It's about Lil Saint and your crew.
It's all love.

934
01:19:46,108 --> 01:19:47,939
-Hey, Marty, what-what?
-What-what.

935
01:19:48,110 --> 01:19:49,338
Yeah.

936
01:19:49,645 --> 01:19:51,909
-Let's go, let's go!
-We got this.

937
01:19:55,884 --> 01:19:57,511
Still missing one by my count.

938
01:19:58,620 --> 01:20:00,019
All right, let's do this.

939
01:20:00,389 --> 01:20:02,186
-No, we got it.
-El.

940
01:20:02,357 --> 01:20:04,325
Come on, let's bury this.
Let me help.

941
01:20:04,493 --> 01:20:07,189
Look, El, it's either David
and all of us...

942
01:20:07,362 --> 01:20:09,193
...or it's none of us.

943
01:20:09,798 --> 01:20:12,699
El, remember, man, we're a team.

944
01:20:25,447 --> 01:20:26,914
Let's do this.

945
01:20:30,452 --> 01:20:32,977
Okay, here's how it's gonna go down.

946
01:20:33,155 --> 01:20:35,487
The beat will play for five minutes.

947
01:20:35,657 --> 01:20:37,591
When I yell "stop," that's it.

948
01:20:37,860 --> 01:20:39,088
Then...

949
01:20:39,261 --> 01:20:42,788
...the audience will decide
who's gonna take home the money...

950
01:20:42,965 --> 01:20:45,866
...and who's gonna be
in my new video.

951
01:20:46,034 --> 01:20:49,526
So may the dopest crew win.

952
01:20:49,705 --> 01:20:53,072
DJ, drop it like it's hot.

953
01:21:00,549 --> 01:21:03,882
All right, listen up, y'all.
Listen up, y'all.

954
01:21:04,052 --> 01:21:07,112
God, now that Lil Saint's with you,
we ask you to bless him.

955
01:21:07,289 --> 01:21:10,019
We ask you to bless our family,
our friends, our crew.

956
01:21:10,192 --> 01:21:13,320
-Give us the strength to win this battle.
-Amen!

957
01:21:13,495 --> 01:21:15,429
In your name we pray. Amen.

958
01:21:15,597 --> 01:21:18,725
Lil Saint, this one's for you, baby!
Let's go!

959
01:26:20,601 --> 01:26:23,001
Back off, back off, back off!

960
01:26:28,109 --> 01:26:30,737
Yeah! That was insane.

961
01:26:30,911 --> 01:26:32,242
Man, that's love.

962
01:26:32,413 --> 01:26:35,746
All right, settle down, settle down.
Settle down.

963
01:26:35,916 --> 01:26:37,110
Settle down!

964
01:26:38,586 --> 01:26:39,814
Settle down.

965
01:26:39,987 --> 01:26:43,388
Man, both crews were incredible.
It's ridiculous.

966
01:26:43,557 --> 01:26:46,082
Damn, my heart's beating fast too.
That was crazy.

967
01:26:46,260 --> 01:26:49,559
Right now we're about to find out
who's the best on the scene.

968
01:26:49,730 --> 01:26:51,061
First up...

969
01:26:51,232 --> 01:26:54,133
...I want y'all to give it up
for Wade's Crew!

970
01:26:59,206 --> 01:27:02,903
Okay, okay. Nice.
Settle down a little bit.

971
01:27:03,077 --> 01:27:04,339
Next...

972
01:27:04,879 --> 01:27:06,779
...the Lil Saints!

973
01:27:15,890 --> 01:27:19,826
Yeah! All right. All right.

974
01:27:20,594 --> 01:27:24,189
All right, settle down! Settle down.

975
01:27:24,365 --> 01:27:25,627
All right.

976
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:28,769
Lil' ~Kim and myself would like
to present the Lil Saints...

977
01:27:28,936 --> 01:27:32,667
...with the Big Bounce $50,000 award!

978
01:28:02,970 --> 01:28:06,531
-You did it, man.
-No, we did it.

979
01:28:07,641 --> 01:28:09,541
El, my boy.

980
01:28:10,845 --> 01:28:12,278
Congratulations!

981
01:28:12,446 --> 01:28:14,004
Holler.

982
01:28:18,486 --> 01:28:20,886
That's all you got for your girl?

983
01:28:38,305 --> 01:28:40,170
Yo, this is bullshit, man.
We had you.

984
01:28:40,374 --> 01:28:43,366
-This ain't over yet.
-lt is now, baby boy.

985
01:28:44,979 --> 01:28:47,504
Y'all just mad. Because today...

986
01:28:47,882 --> 01:28:49,713
...you suckers got served.

987
01:28:49,884 --> 01:28:51,647
Served. Served.

988
01:28:51,819 --> 01:28:53,684
Served! Served!

989
01:29:02,163 --> 01:29:05,826
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
The Lil Saints have won $50,000!

990
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,969

Peace, y'all!
