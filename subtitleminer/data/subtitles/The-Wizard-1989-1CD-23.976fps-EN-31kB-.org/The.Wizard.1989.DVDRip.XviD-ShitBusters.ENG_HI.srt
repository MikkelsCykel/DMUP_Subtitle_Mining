It's me, Corey.

445
00:42:51,607 --> 00:42:54,770
That's what it is.
He's jealous.

446
00:42:54,844 --> 00:42:57,904
Jealous?
Over you?

Geez, Corey, you're so thick!

You're all he's got.
Don't you understand that?

449

Aw, you're crazy.
He doesn't even figure that way.

- Look, Haley, all I said-
- I told you, this is a business deal.

You took us for 20 bucks last night.

465

- Yeah, what of it?
- You didn't tell us this mutant
was some kind of pro.

466
00:44:25,635 --> 00:44:28,900
Pro? My grandmother
could have taken you.

467
00:44:28,971 --> 00:44:32,429
- Let's just dish it up,
all right, smart-ass?
- Hey, it was a fair bet.

468

- Let's see what
the little mutant's got.
- [Grunting]

469
00:44:35,945 --> 00:44:38,140
Hey, leave him alone!
Give it back to him!

470

What the hell is this?

471
00:44:53,095 --> 00:44:57,896
- Corey, give them the money.
- [Boy] Yeah.

472
00:45:05,675 --> 00:45:08,109
This is for interest, dork.

You go ahead.
You have yourself a nice day.

Thanks, kids.
Whoo!

Jennifer.

What are they?

478
00:45:23,659 --> 00:45:26,958
I always wondered
what he had in that thing.

479
00:45:28,597 --> 00:45:30,588
It was her.

480
00:45:35,504 --> 00:45:37,495
[Corey]
She was his twin sister.

481
00:45:40,643 --> 00:45:46,548
They got down by the river,
Jimmy and her, and somehow
Jennifer got too close.

482
00:45:55,658 --> 00:45:59,719
Jimmy couldn't swim,
so he was afraid.

483
00:46:02,665 --> 00:46:05,259
It was weird,

484
00:46:05,334 --> 00:46:08,326
'cause-
'cause she didn't go downstream at all.

485
00:46:08,404 --> 00:46:11,931
She just died...

486
00:46:12,008 --> 00:46:15,000
in a few feet of water
right in front of him.

487
00:46:17,246 --> 00:46:19,714
It was really hard for Jimmy...

488
00:46:21,717 --> 00:46:23,708
and for Nick.

489
00:46:25,388 --> 00:46:27,515
Who's Nick?

490
00:46:27,590 --> 00:46:29,581
My brother.

491
00:46:31,227 --> 00:46:34,458
He was supposed to be
watching them for Christine.

492
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:37,090
Nick and Christine
didn't get along too well.

493
00:46:41,470 --> 00:46:45,873
<i>Because Christine</i>
<i>was my dad's second wife,</i>
<i>Jimmy and Jennifer,</i>

494
00:46:45,941 --> 00:46:51,174
we were their half brothers,
but Christine didn't really
see it that way.

You can't quit. Not now.

half the games Lucas has.

509

Does he dress like you?
No.

512

Would you pull over?
<i>California!</i>

What the hell are they doin'?
I don't know.

1036
01:31:44,971 --> 01:31:46,962

What's the problem? Huh?
I don't know.
It's the only California he knows about.

1040
01:32:10,530 --> 01:32:13,294
Is he okay?
Yeah, he's okay.

Where'd he go?

1044
01:32:44,697 --> 01:32:47,222

Jimmy-
Jimmy, is this California?

1053
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:59,030
I guess, he just wanted to leave her
in a place where she was happy.

1054
01:34:12,518 --> 01:34:15,510
I guess he wanted
to say good-bye.
