00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,026
Turn around.

2
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:37,826
Turn around.

3
00:00:38,304 --> 00:00:42,070
Turn the car around
and get the hell out of here.

4
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:45,006
Right now.

5
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,427
Don't go back.

6
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:12,269
Do not go back there.

7
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:49,770
Hey! Hey!

8
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:24,366
What the hell's going on here?

9
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,317
You stole my story.

10
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:56,394
Well?

11
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:58,860
I'm sorry. Do l--?

12
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:01,593
-I don't know you.
-I know that.

13
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:05,067
That doesn't matter. I know you,
Mr. Rainey, that's what matters.

14
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:06,637
You stole my story.

15
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:09,568
You're mistaken.
I don't read manuscripts.

16
00:05:09,742 --> 00:05:13,075
You read this one already.
You stole it.

17
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:14,708
I can assure you that l--

18
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:17,349
I know you can. I know that.
I don't want to be assured.

19
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:22,387
If you want to talk to someone about
some grievance you feel you have...

20
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:27,822
-...call my literary agent in New York.
-This is between you and me.

21
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:35,363
We don't need outsiders, Mr. Rainey.
It is strictly between you and me.

22
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:38,927
All right, look, mister,
whoever you are...

23
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:41,665
...I don't like being accused
of plagiarism...

24
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:44,833
...if that's what you're accusing me of.
Chico, inside.

25
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:48,276
I don't blame you for not liking it,
but you did it.

26
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:49,745
You stole my story.

27
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:52,248
-Leave. I have nothing more to say.
-Yeah, I'll go.

28
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:54,847
We'll talk more later.

29
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,511
I'm not taking that.

30
00:05:56,689 --> 00:06:00,352
Won't do you any good to
play games with me, Mr. Rainey.

31
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:02,617
This has got to be settled.

32
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:04,786
So far as I'm concerned, it is.

33
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:26,034
"Sowing Season.

34
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:27,903
John Shooter."

35
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:36,721
Never heard of you, pal.

36
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:41,022
Never heard of your story.

37
00:07:58,344 --> 00:07:59,971
Now...

38
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:04,312
...where was l?

39
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:36,608
I'm open to suggestions.

40
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:48,693
If you don't go and bite her,
I'll kill her.

41
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:57,930
"Four days after George had
confirmed to his satisfaction...

42
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:00,163
...that his wife was cheating on him,
he confront--"

43
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:01,931
This is just bad writing.

44
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,241
Just bad writing.

45
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:11,244
So you know what to do.

46
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:13,150
Just do it.

47
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:20,551
No bad writing.

48
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,225
I think that solves it.

49
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:54,692
Oh, I found one of your stories
in the trash, Mr. Rainey.

50
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,795
I thought you might want it,
so I put it on the table.

51
00:09:57,964 --> 00:10:00,831
Yeah, I see that, Mrs. Garvey.

52
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:18,881
"Todd Downey thought that a woman
who would steal your love...

53
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:22,885
...when your love was really all you
had, was not much of a woman.

54
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:25,216
He, therefore, decided to kill her.

55
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:27,682
He would bury her in
the deep corner formed...

56
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:31,159
... where the house and the barn
came together at an extreme angle.

57
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,821
He would bury her where
his wife kept her garden.

58
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,161
The garden she loved
more than she loved him. "

59
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:38,030
Oh, shit. Oh, sh--

60
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:42,864
Thank God. From the sound of you,
I didn't know what to think.

61
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:44,873
Let me get this. That's my job.

62
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:47,239
I'm terribly sorry, Mrs. Garvey.
I really am.

63
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:49,711
I'll take care of this.
Go on back to work.

64
00:10:49,882 --> 00:10:52,009
-I didn't write this.
-Oh, I thought you did.

65
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:56,848
No, it's not mine. Look, it says John
Shooter right there. It's not me.

66
00:10:57,023 --> 00:10:59,548
Oh, I thought it was one of those...

67
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:01,716
...whatchamacallums,
pseudo-names or "-nyms."

68
00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:04,658
No. No, I never used one.
I've never used one.

69
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:09,267
Oh, I can't imagine why you would.
I mean, hide behind a made-up name.

70
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:14,532
No. Mrs. Garvey, what I'm trying to tell
you is that someone else wrote this.

71
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:16,766
Oh. Okey dokey, then.

72
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:44,059
"A woman who'd steal your love
when your love was all you had...

73
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:45,828
...wasn't much of a woman.

74
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:48,371
That, at least,
was Tommy Haverlock's opinion.

75
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,031
He decided to kill her.

76
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:53,076
He even knew the place he would
bury her. The exact place.

77
00:11:53,245 --> 00:11:55,839
The little patch of garden
she kept in the extreme angle...

78
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:59,178
...formed where the old and new parts
of the house came together.

79
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:02,650
He'd bury her in the garden she loved
more than she loved him. "

80
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:06,249
Come to the flea market with me.
It'll be fun.

81
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:10,217
We've got to get rid of some of
this stuff. Look at this, it's awful.

82
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:12,826
No wonder they left it.

83
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:17,599
Oh, my God, look, there's a window.

84
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:21,369
It's a secret window.

85
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:24,908
Oh, this is perfect.

86
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:26,802
I'm gonna put my garden
right there.

87
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:31,679
It's a secret window, and it'll look down
on a secret garden.

88
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,178
Shit.

89
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:40,613
I didn't steal it.

90
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:44,350
What?

91
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:48,884
Mr. Rainey?

92
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:50,826
I'm all done.

93
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,395
Really? So soon? Well...

94
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:57,167
-...I'll see you next time.
-Mr. Rainey...

95
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,894
...there's something I want to say.

96
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:02,696
Some women don't know
a good thing when they got it.

97
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:07,738
They don't know they got the whole
world right in front of their nose.

98
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:09,710
There. That's it.

99
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:13,083
Not another word from me.

100
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:18,784
Mr. Rainey?

101
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,417
Can I make you something to eat?

102
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:24,119
No. I ate. Well, earlier.

103
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:27,663
I'm going to eat later.
And I'll make it myself.

104
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:30,131
You're a good man, Mr. Rainey.

105
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:31,599
You too, Mrs. Garvey.

106
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:45,478
It's my personal business,
Mrs. Garvey. Thank you very much.

107
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:47,949
My pillows now.

108
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:51,384
Her sticky, weird fingers
on my privacy.

109
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:56,756
I didn't steal that story.

110
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:06,767
I don't think.

111
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:56,654
-Hello?
-Hello, Mort.

112
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:00,357
-Are you all right?
-Yeah. I'm all right.

113
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:02,858
-Why wouldn't I be all right?
-I don't know.

114
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:06,254
You're up there alone. Anything could
happen and nobody would know.

115
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:08,662
-I'd know.
-Right.

116
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:12,736
How's my little baby puppy? Did
Chico get those cataracts removed?

117
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:15,032
Why did you call, Amy?
What do you want?

118
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:17,175
I had one of those feelings I get.

119
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:20,039
I know you think they're stupid
and you don't believe them...

120
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:21,440
...but I believe them.

121
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:26,141
I was making a sandwich and I had a
sensation that you might not be okay.

122
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,582
I held off as long as possible.

123
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:31,814
But then I couldn't anymore,
so here I am.

124
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,892
Well, I don't know what to tell you
except I'm fine.

125
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:37,191
Nothing weird happened or anything?

126
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:42,966
Do you remember "Secret Window"?

127
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:44,363
What?

128
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:49,064
My story. You know, the one where
the woman has the garden...

129
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:51,402
...and then the guy has the shovel.

130
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:54,045
-Not one of my favorites.
-That's good to know.

131
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:56,204
Well, it was kind of hostile,
don't you think?

132
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:59,215
Gee, I miss your constructive criticism.
I really do.

133
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:00,682
What about the story, Mort?

134
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,321
I was just wondering,
do you think it's possible...

135
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:08,085
...that I might have been influenced
by anybody or anything at that time?

136
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:09,817
Other than Jack Daniel's?

137
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:13,090
I know that part, Amy,
hence the question.

138
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:14,493
I don't know.

139
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:17,829
You got weird on that one.
You'd write it mostly at night, I think.

140
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:21,604
-What do you mean, "influenced"?
-I don't know.

141
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:23,207
Like, by another story?

142
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,605
Look, forget it.

143
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:29,645
Mort, you swore the one time
was the only time.

144
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:32,249
Forget it, please.
Please, just forget it. Come on.

145
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:34,480
How's T ed?

146
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:36,979
He's fine.

147
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:41,024
I was thinking that he and I should get
together sometime, have a drink...

148
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,592
...because we've been to a lot
of the same places.

149
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:46,126
-You know what? I gotta go.
-So do l.

150
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:49,523
Okay.

151
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:51,498
-ls he there?
-No.

152
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:52,932
We're not together.

153
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,740
Wow, well...

154
00:17:57,709 --> 00:18:01,167
...I'd be lying if I said I wasn't on
the verge of doing Snoopy dances.

155
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:03,177
No, Mort.

156
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:07,308
What I meant was we're
not together at the moment.

157
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:12,446
He's coming over later. He hardly ever
comes here. I usually go to his house.

158
00:18:13,158 --> 00:18:15,752
There's a useful detail.
Thanks for that.

159
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,328
Don't ask, then.
It was working just fine that way.

160
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:20,761
I think you should have him
over to the house more.

161
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:24,369
Such a nice house. I like it.
I mean, I love it. That's why I bought it.

162
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,199
Goodbye, Mort.

163
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:29,035
Goodbye, Amy.

164
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:38,946
Shit. Shit. Shit.
Stupid. Stupid. Stupid.

165
00:18:57,469 --> 00:19:00,233
-You read it?
-I did.

166
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:03,340
I imagine it rang a bell, didn't it?

167
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:05,568
Oh, it certainly did.

168
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:07,568
When did you write it?

169
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:09,714
I thought you'd ask that.

170
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:11,144
That's the whole point.

171
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:14,752
Two writers have the same story,
it's all about who wrote the words first.

172
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,150
-Wouldn't you say that's true?
-I suppose so.

173
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:20,723
I suppose that's why I came
all the way up here from Mississippi.

174
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:33,570
I wrote it seven years ago, 1 997.

175
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:35,373
How'd you get it?

176
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:37,565
That's what I really want to know.

177
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:41,372
How in the hell did a big
money-scribbling asshole like you...

178
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:44,175
...get down to a little shitsplat town
in Mississippi...

179
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:47,011
...and steal my goddamn story?

180
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,915
-Drop it.
-Drop it?

181
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:52,454
Drop it. What in the hell
do you mean, drop it?

182
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:57,388
You said you wrote your story in 1 997.
I wrote mine in late '94.

183
00:19:57,563 --> 00:20:01,021
It was published for the first time
in June 1 995 in a magazine.

184
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,033
Nice try, Mr. Shooter,
but I beat you by two years.

185
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,501
If anybody's got a bitch about
plagiarism, it's me.

186
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:08,566
You lie!

187
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:11,468
-No, I don't!
-Prove it!

188
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:13,702
I don't have to prove a thing to you.

189
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:18,316
Go look for yourself. Ellery Queen's
Mystery Magazine, June 1 995.

190
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:21,543
-And how am I supposed to find that?
-That's not my problem.

191
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,747
Am I supposed to drive down to your
house in Riverdale, New York...

192
00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:28,791
...and ask your wife, Amy, for it?

193
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:31,695
I read it on your book jacket.

194
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,555
That's not my house. That's hers.

195
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,030
What the hell does that mean?

196
00:20:36,201 --> 00:20:39,728
What do you think, you ignorant hick?
I'm in the middle of a divorce.

197
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:43,898
D-l-V-O-R-C-E. Divorce.

198
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:46,911
You strike me as the kind of guy...

199
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:51,573
...who's on the lookout for a head
he can knock off with a shovel.

200
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:55,846
But what you don't understand is,
if we do start to fight...

201
00:20:57,122 --> 00:20:59,181
...it's not going to end...

202
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:02,191
...until one or the other of us
is dead.

203
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:10,292
Hold your water,
I'm just getting my smokes.

204
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:12,764
I don't smoke.

205
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,530
I'll give you three days.

206
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:18,369
Call your ex and get her to send you
the magazine with your story in it...

207
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:20,807
...if there is such a magazine...

208
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:22,310
...and I'll be back.

209
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:26,110
If I show you, will you go back where
you came from and leave me alone?

210
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:30,511
Three days.

211
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,724
Always a pleasure to meet a reader.

212
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,310
I don't want to call her.

213
00:21:56,848 --> 00:21:59,908
I want to go to sleep.
I want to take a nap.

214
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:03,481
Okay. No nap.

215
00:22:04,022 --> 00:22:06,582
I give her a call
about the magazine...

216
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:10,023
...I go write some crap
for a couple of hours...

217
00:22:10,195 --> 00:22:13,358
...and then I get to take a nap. Right?

218
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:15,193
Chico?

219
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:18,526
Chico

220
00:22:18,704 --> 00:22:21,229
Don't be discouraged

221
00:22:21,406 --> 00:22:24,034
All right, go ahead and be
discouraged, you blind bastard.

222
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:25,198
See if I care.

223
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:30,640
And returned to the couch...

224
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:34,248
...in shame...

225
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:36,754
...degradation...

226
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:45,029
...and sloth.

227
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:47,231
Sloth.

228
00:25:08,139 --> 00:25:09,834
Shooter!

229
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,339
I'll get you for this!

230
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,874
You hear me?

231
00:25:20,051 --> 00:25:22,519
I'll get you for this!

232
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,977
Chico? He killed Chico?

233
00:25:54,252 --> 00:25:57,244
Yeah. Last night around 9.
I was asleep.

234
00:25:57,422 --> 00:25:59,253
Look, he left this.

235
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:03,884
"You have three days.
I'm not joking. No police."

236
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:06,997
Anytime somebody sits down
and writes "No police"...

237
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:11,124
...that's exactly the time that a fella
should get himself over to the police.

238
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:13,669
Yeah, well, that's what I figured.

239
00:26:13,838 --> 00:26:17,706
So, what I've got is a detailed
description of him and his car.

240
00:26:17,876 --> 00:26:21,277
Type a little harder.
You have to get through the carbon.

241
00:26:21,446 --> 00:26:23,243
I didn't get the license plate number...

242
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:27,579
...but I'm sure it had Mississippi tags,
and I think that it started with an A.

243
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:29,117
That's what I see in my mind.

244
00:26:29,287 --> 00:26:33,587
Needlepoint. Can you believe it?
Doc says it's good for the arthritis.

245
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:38,587
Anyway, anything you can find out
about this guy, I'd appreciate it.

246
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:42,221
I must cut quite an intimidating
law-enforcement figure, huh?

247
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:48,469
I'd like to know what I'm dealing with.
Maybe he has a violent history.

248
00:26:48,907 --> 00:26:52,172
Maybe you can find him, talk to him.
I think that would be better.

249
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:55,040
So you got yourself a member
of the crazy folks tribe?

250
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:59,106
Yeah. I mean, they pop up
every once in a while.

251
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:02,253
I suppose it's just the price
of selling a few books.

252
00:27:03,321 --> 00:27:04,948
Sorry.

253
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:09,285
Here's the.... Here's that description.

254
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:12,259
Of course, killing an animal
isn't like killing a man.

255
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:14,890
I'm not even sure it's a crime,
come to think.

256
00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:17,261
Come on, it's gotta be.
What about animal cruelty?

257
00:27:17,435 --> 00:27:19,903
What about destruction
of private property? What about--?

258
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:21,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Maybe.

259
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,964
Okay.

260
00:27:24,676 --> 00:27:27,804
First thing I'm going to need
is a description.

261
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:32,343
Tell me the truth. Did you steal it?

262
00:27:32,517 --> 00:27:34,041
What? No!

263
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:37,154
Kind of an amazing coincidence,
don't you think?

264
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:39,051
The stories being so much alike?

265
00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:42,853
Obviously he copied me. Would you
like to choose a side before we go on?

266
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:45,690
I'm on your side.
But I still need to know the truth.

267
00:27:45,864 --> 00:27:47,695
Which kind of situation is this?

268
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:51,768
Is he a regular wacko like you've had
before, in which case I can help...

269
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:54,404
...or something you should talk
to your lawyer about?

270
00:27:54,572 --> 00:27:58,440
No, this guy is just simply
out of his mind. That's all it is.

271
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:00,737
Fine. Okay.

272
00:28:00,912 --> 00:28:02,539
What do you want me to do?

273
00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:05,444
I want you to help me
in the same way that--

274
00:28:06,451 --> 00:28:10,854
In the same way that you did before.

275
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:12,717
He wasn't this crazy.

276
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:14,859
That guy was just
an obsessed reader...

277
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:18,189
...who couldn't tell real life from
the crap you make up for a living.

278
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:19,796
No offense.

279
00:28:20,065 --> 00:28:22,625
Now, this Shooter guy,
he threaten your life?

280
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:26,732
-He put a screwdriver through my dog.
-Well, he did break a law...

281
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:29,931
...but it doesn't seem to be a
very important law in Tashmore Lake.

282
00:28:30,108 --> 00:28:32,702
The sheriff must be a cat person.

283
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:34,902
Yeah, well, I don't exactly feel safe...

284
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:38,311
...with a 70-year-old arthritic sheriff
watching my back.

285
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:40,348
Are you gonna help me or not?

286
00:28:40,518 --> 00:28:41,746
Let's see...

287
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,450
...I got a corporate loyalty thing
I got to be back for on Friday...

288
00:28:46,624 --> 00:28:48,592
...but I can give you
a couple of days.

289
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,450
Okay.

290
00:28:50,628 --> 00:28:53,062
My story came out a couple years...

291
00:28:54,332 --> 00:28:57,733
...before he says he wrote his.

292
00:28:57,902 --> 00:28:59,961
I've got a copy of the original
at Amy's house.

293
00:29:00,138 --> 00:29:02,732
I was just gonna stop by
on my way upstate and pick it up.

294
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:05,205
-Amy's house?
-Yeah.

295
00:29:05,376 --> 00:29:08,402
-Amy and I split up six months ago.
-I'm sorry.

296
00:29:09,347 --> 00:29:10,609
Yeah, me too.

297
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:12,443
-Amicable?
-Not remotely.

298
00:29:12,617 --> 00:29:16,178
What happened? You finally nail one
of your groupies at a book signing?

299
00:29:16,354 --> 00:29:18,322
The Omaha Barnes and Noble?

300
00:29:23,795 --> 00:29:26,855
That was a dick thing to say,
you know? Rotten profession.

301
00:29:27,665 --> 00:29:29,132
I apologize.

302
00:29:29,901 --> 00:29:32,631
-You were saying?
-I was saying...

303
00:29:33,304 --> 00:29:38,264
...that if it's just proof that this guy
wants, fine. I show him the magazine.

304
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:40,638
But I think maybe you should
be with me when I do.

305
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:42,143
No shit,
I'm gonna be with you.

306
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:45,606
-You remember my rate?
-Yeah. An obscene fortune, right?

307
00:29:46,017 --> 00:29:49,111
You'll see a black Cadillac in the
driveway tonight when you get home.

308
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:51,653
Don't freak out,
it's me keeping an eye on things.

309
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:53,222
Okay.

310
00:29:53,391 --> 00:29:56,383
Get a good night's sleep.
You don't look too hot.

311
00:30:35,366 --> 00:30:38,893
This is not my beautiful house.

312
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:43,274
This is not my beautiful wife.

313
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:47,435
Anymore.

314
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:03,111
-You scared the shit out of me.
-Hey, I'm sorry about that.

315
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:05,756
This last week must have
finally caught up with me.

316
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,415
-That's very reassuring. Thanks.
-Hey, relax, Hemingway.

317
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:10,686
I was only out 1 0 minutes,
swear to God.

318
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:13,194
Already checked the place.
Everything is fine.

319
00:32:13,364 --> 00:32:15,798
Just waiting for you to get back
to let you know.

320
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:20,700
You think you'll be
sticking around tonight, or...?

321
00:32:20,872 --> 00:32:23,864
No. Not unless you want me to.

322
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:28,044
No. No.

323
00:32:28,212 --> 00:32:31,704
No, I'm sure it's fine in there.

324
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:34,717
Nope.

325
00:32:35,486 --> 00:32:37,010
No monsters up here.

326
00:32:37,188 --> 00:32:38,655
Did you check under my bed?

327
00:32:38,823 --> 00:32:40,313
Even in your toy chest.

328
00:32:40,491 --> 00:32:43,790
I'll be back in the morning.
Start asking around town.

329
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,987
What the hell you gonna
do with that, sailor?

330
00:32:46,164 --> 00:32:48,724
Find out who else saw your nut-job.

331
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,492
Tom Greenleaf.

332
00:32:52,704 --> 00:32:55,468
Tom Greenleaf passed by
when I was talking to Shooter.

333
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,507
He waved at us, so he must have
gotten a good look at him.

334
00:32:58,676 --> 00:33:01,304
Tom Greenleaf.
How do I get ahold of him?

335
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:03,674
Bowie's store,
breakfast every morning, 9 a.m.

336
00:33:03,848 --> 00:33:05,975
Okay, I got it. Don't worry.

337
00:33:06,184 --> 00:33:09,017
Once I find out where
this Shooter's staying...

338
00:33:09,187 --> 00:33:13,419
...I'll stop in for a little freak-me-out
chat. Use the word "we" a lot.

339
00:33:13,591 --> 00:33:17,925
"We know what you're doing. We want
it to stop. We're watching you."

340
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:22,092
Trust me, he'll hit the road so hard,
it'll hit back.

341
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:27,668
Hey. You know what?
Are you staying in town tonight?

342
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,830
Yeah, some motel out by Route 9.

343
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:33,273
Irv's Lakesider, I think it's called.
You know the place?

344
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,845
-Yeah, I know the place.
-Okay.

345
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,347
Good night.

346
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:15,647
Hello?

347
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:26,196
Shit.

348
00:36:04,395 --> 00:36:06,522
I know you're in there, shithead!

349
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:13,770
If you don't come out
by the time I count to five...

350
00:36:15,206 --> 00:36:17,037
...I'm gonna come in swinging.

351
00:36:22,813 --> 00:36:24,246
One.

352
00:36:25,883 --> 00:36:27,578
Two!

353
00:36:36,827 --> 00:36:38,522
I killed a mirror.

354
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:47,470
And my shower door.

355
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:49,262
I don't care. I'm just gonna smoke.
I'm just gonna totally smoke.

356
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:49,600
I'll finish these, go to the store...

357
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,329
I'll finish these, go to the store...

358
00:37:51,502 --> 00:37:54,699
...get a brand-new pack,
smoke the shit out of that one.

359
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:18,221
Thought you didn't smoke.

360
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:26,029
I took it up recently for my health.

361
00:38:26,203 --> 00:38:28,433
How are you, Mr. Rainey?

362
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:32,041
Oh, I'm just peachy, Mr. Shooter.
How are you?

363
00:38:32,209 --> 00:38:35,770
Well, it sounded like you pitched a fit
or something in there.

364
00:38:35,946 --> 00:38:39,074
I don't think you're really
all that well.

365
00:38:39,617 --> 00:38:44,714
Stealing from another man, that don't
seem to have ever bothered you none.

366
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:46,818
Being caught up on, though.

367
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:51,892
Or maybe it's just that
successful writers like you...

368
00:38:52,063 --> 00:38:55,430
...throw tantrums when things
don't go the way they expect.

369
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,900
Why didn't you get that magazine?

370
00:38:58,069 --> 00:39:01,197
You were down there at
her house today, weren't you?

371
00:39:01,605 --> 00:39:04,802
If I get this story
and I show it to you...

372
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:07,135
...will you then kindly disappear?

373
00:39:07,311 --> 00:39:11,907
There isn't any magazine
with that story in it, Mr. Rainey.

374
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:13,778
You and me, we know that.

375
00:39:14,118 --> 00:39:15,915
Okay, then.

376
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:20,589
What can we do to make you
feel better?

377
00:39:27,498 --> 00:39:29,693
I want you to fix it.

378
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,592
What would you like me to fix?

379
00:39:31,769 --> 00:39:33,703
My ending.

380
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:36,032
The one you wrecked.

381
00:39:36,607 --> 00:39:38,541
I can't decide what's worse...

382
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:42,609
...stealing my story
or ruining the ending.

383
00:39:42,813 --> 00:39:44,405
Mine was perfect.

384
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:47,716
-I don't think I read your whole story.
-Oh, I bet you did.

385
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:53,050
"'l know I can do it,'
Todd Downey said...

386
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:57,752
...helping himself to another ear
of corn from the steaming bowl.

387
00:39:57,928 --> 00:39:59,452
'I'm sure that in time...

388
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:03,964
...her death will be a mystery
even to me."'

389
00:40:04,135 --> 00:40:09,038
That's how the story ends, pilgrim.
It's the only ending.

390
00:40:09,206 --> 00:40:12,642
You're going to write it for me
and get it published.

391
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:15,176
And it's gonna have my name on it.

392
00:40:15,346 --> 00:40:18,247
I'd be more than happy to write your
ending, Mr. Shooter.

393
00:40:21,852 --> 00:40:25,117
Saw that wife of yours
coming out of the house.

394
00:40:26,657 --> 00:40:29,820
-She's purty.
-My wife?

395
00:40:29,994 --> 00:40:32,326
Why don't we just
leave her out of this.

396
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:35,990
Would if I could...

397
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:40,035
...but I'm starting to think you ain't
gonna leave me that option.

398
00:40:45,176 --> 00:40:47,667
You want to wake up from
one of your stupid naps...

399
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:50,245
...and find Amy nailed
to your garbage bin?

400
00:40:50,414 --> 00:40:54,350
Or turn on the radio some morning
and hear she came off second-best...

401
00:40:54,518 --> 00:40:58,010
...in a match with the chain saw
you keep out in the shed?

402
00:40:59,857 --> 00:41:01,347
Do you?

403
00:41:03,494 --> 00:41:05,689
You can't get away with it.

404
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:11,066
I know what you did...

405
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:15,899
...and I ain't quitting
until right gets put right.

406
00:42:36,787 --> 00:42:39,312
-ls that you, John Wayne?
-Mort?

407
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:41,519
Are you there? Mort?

408
00:42:41,692 --> 00:42:44,160
Yes, Amy, I'm here.
Just lower your voice a little.

409
00:42:44,328 --> 00:42:45,693
-What is it?
-Where have you been?

410
00:42:45,863 --> 00:42:48,696
I've been trying to get ahold of you
all night and this morning.

411
00:42:48,866 --> 00:42:50,094
I was asleep.

412
00:42:50,267 --> 00:42:52,565
Oh, great, so you unplugged
the phone?

413
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:54,864
How may I assist you, Amy?

414
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:56,700
Oh, God, Mort.

415
00:42:57,374 --> 00:42:59,171
What happened? What?

416
00:42:59,343 --> 00:43:02,972
Someone burned down our house.
That's what happened, okay?

417
00:43:03,147 --> 00:43:06,480
-What?
-Someone burned down our house!

418
00:43:26,503 --> 00:43:28,164
Bye, babe.

419
00:43:29,807 --> 00:43:31,035
Pardon me, miss.

420
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:34,041
-You left $1 00 on the dresser.
-Shut up!

421
00:43:34,211 --> 00:43:36,543
Surely the escort service told
you I was three.

422
00:43:36,714 --> 00:43:38,113
Please.

423
00:43:38,415 --> 00:43:41,509
Some guys are less, some guys
are 1 00 if you like that kind of thing.

424
00:43:41,685 --> 00:43:44,654
Some guys are less than that,
but I'm three. I happen to be three.

425
00:43:44,822 --> 00:43:46,847
There's something
on your mouth there.

426
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:48,724
Bye.

427
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:01,762
Mort!

428
00:44:07,911 --> 00:44:10,038
-Hi.
-Hi.

429
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:15,808
-I'm really sorry about all this, Amy.
-So am l.

430
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:18,011
Me too.

431
00:44:18,389 --> 00:44:19,617
Thank you, Ted.

432
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:22,054
-Mr. and Mrs. Rainey?
-Yes.

433
00:44:22,226 --> 00:44:26,560
-You the owners?
-Yes, we are. We were the owners.

434
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:29,494
Were the owners?
What do you mean?

435
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:31,464
You don't own it anymore?

436
00:44:31,635 --> 00:44:34,468
Were Mr. and Mrs. Rainey.
Are the owners.

437
00:44:34,638 --> 00:44:37,732
-I'm Steven Bradley, Riverdale P D.
-How do you do? Ted Milner.

438
00:44:37,908 --> 00:44:40,103
-This is Fire Chief Wickersham.
-Chief.

439
00:44:40,277 --> 00:44:43,678
We won't keep you long. The insurance
investigator needs to see you at 3.

440
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:47,442
You're victims of arson. The fire was
started by an incendiary device...

441
00:44:47,618 --> 00:44:50,951
...made with a champagne bottle
and a couple of quarts of gasoline.

442
00:44:51,121 --> 00:44:52,816
Oh, that really works, then, eh?

443
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:54,582
So first question:

444
00:44:54,758 --> 00:44:56,453
Enemies. You got any?

445
00:44:56,627 --> 00:44:59,528
-No. No one.
-No, no. Not a soul.

446
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:02,924
Bother you if I answer
one or two of these, Ted?

447
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:05,091
It's okay. It's cool.

448
00:45:09,173 --> 00:45:10,538
Yeah.

449
00:45:11,809 --> 00:45:13,367
I have an enemy.

450
00:45:13,811 --> 00:45:16,109
Sorry I wasn't there to meet you
this morning.

451
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:21,445
I spent last night poking around the
site with a flashlight and a Polaroid.

452
00:45:21,618 --> 00:45:23,950
Oops. Broke one of my own rules.

453
00:45:24,121 --> 00:45:27,613
I don't like to call it "the site."
It wasn't a site, it was a house.

454
00:45:27,791 --> 00:45:30,589
Your house,
and I'm sorry for your loss.

455
00:45:30,761 --> 00:45:33,389
Thank you very much, Mrs. Evans.

456
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:36,590
It still says "Mrs."? Fran is fine.

457
00:45:37,668 --> 00:45:39,158
These meetings are hard.

458
00:45:39,336 --> 00:45:41,998
People in your situation
are already upset...

459
00:45:42,172 --> 00:45:44,299
...and quite often
they see an investigator...

460
00:45:44,475 --> 00:45:47,308
...as an accusation that they've
torched their own property.

461
00:45:47,478 --> 00:45:50,072
And in this case, you've given us
a plausible suspect...

462
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:52,772
...who we'll investigate aggressively
along with the police.

463
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:56,317
But in the meantime, that's a list of
your claimed insurable property.

464
00:45:56,487 --> 00:46:00,787
Read it and sign an affidavit swearing
that the items still belong to you...

465
00:46:00,958 --> 00:46:03,256
...and that they were inside
when the fire occurred.

466
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:05,895
I'm told there was a separation
of residence recently...

467
00:46:06,063 --> 00:46:07,997
...so that last bit will be important.

468
00:46:08,165 --> 00:46:10,360
We're going through a divorce.
It's not final yet.

469
00:46:10,534 --> 00:46:12,900
Well, the settlement agreement's
all done.

470
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:14,867
Everything's been negotiated...

471
00:46:15,038 --> 00:46:18,496
...we're just waiting for it
to be signed by both parties.

472
00:46:18,675 --> 00:46:20,768
I moved out about six months ago...

473
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:24,311
...and just hadn't gotten around to
hauling all the stuff out yet, so....

474
00:46:24,481 --> 00:46:27,348
Been down that road. Sucks.

475
00:46:27,851 --> 00:46:30,513
These things just have to follow
their natural course.

476
00:46:31,188 --> 00:46:35,249
Things will wrap up when everybody's
ready for that to happen.

477
00:46:36,393 --> 00:46:38,361
That's been my feeling.

478
00:46:39,229 --> 00:46:41,697
In the meantime,
do the best you can with the list.

479
00:46:41,865 --> 00:46:43,332
Thanks.

480
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:02,551
Do you actually intend
to rubberneck?

481
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:05,313
I hardly think my concern could be
construed as rubbernecking.

482
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:06,717
Amy, he's rubbernecking.

483
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:10,724
I'm not gonna freak out about this,
but, I mean, this is our stuff.

484
00:47:10,894 --> 00:47:12,555
No. All right. He's right.

485
00:47:12,729 --> 00:47:15,095
-This is our stuff.
-He's right. He's right, Ted.

486
00:47:15,265 --> 00:47:19,395
He is right. The law says you have
no right to see the listed items at all.

487
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:23,904
We wink at things like this if nobody
minds, but it seems Mr. Rainey does.

488
00:47:24,074 --> 00:47:26,702
Yes. Mr. Rainey minds a lot.

489
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:32,774
Would it help matters
if I took a walk around the block?

490
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:35,316
-Yes, thanks.
-Sure.

491
00:47:36,954 --> 00:47:40,014
Oh, heck, Ted, live a little.
Make it two.

492
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:43,951
Rubbernecker.

493
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:03,941
Mort.

494
00:48:04,114 --> 00:48:06,344
-Wait. I need to ask you something.
-What?

495
00:48:06,516 --> 00:48:11,749
This guy, Shooter. His story. I mean,
is this situation like the other time?

496
00:48:11,922 --> 00:48:15,085
I'm sorry. I wouldn't bring it up,
but it did happen once before.

497
00:48:15,259 --> 00:48:18,751
Look, that is the only time I've ever
done anything remotely like that.

498
00:48:18,929 --> 00:48:22,262
I paid the guy everything he wanted.
Never happened before or since.

499
00:48:22,432 --> 00:48:24,423
-Okay. Okay.
-Okay.

500
00:48:26,837 --> 00:48:29,305
-Amy.
-What?

501
00:48:31,441 --> 00:48:33,807
Only you, me and the lawyers
know about that, right?

502
00:48:34,111 --> 00:48:35,544
Right.

503
00:48:35,712 --> 00:48:38,078
Because you haven't said
anything to Ted. Surely not.

504
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:39,579
No.

505
00:48:39,883 --> 00:48:42,283
-Have you said something to Ted?
-Come on!

506
00:48:43,987 --> 00:48:45,852
Well, do I have timing or what?

507
00:48:46,023 --> 00:48:47,490
Yes, you do.

508
00:48:47,658 --> 00:48:50,650
Sorry you had to miss that.
I know how much you like my things.

509
00:48:50,827 --> 00:48:53,489
-Oh, Jesus.
-You and me are gonna have a talk.

510
00:48:53,664 --> 00:48:55,757
Be back in 1 0 minutes.

511
00:48:57,067 --> 00:48:59,001
I'm in trouble.

512
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:06,541
-I've had enough of your bullshit.
-You're a dick.

513
00:49:07,377 --> 00:49:09,038
Do you feel better?

514
00:49:09,212 --> 00:49:10,509
Yes, I do.

515
00:49:10,681 --> 00:49:14,879
Yeah, look, marriages end.
I'm sorry, but I didn't end yours.

516
00:49:15,052 --> 00:49:16,883
It was done by the time I got there.

517
00:49:17,054 --> 00:49:20,046
Really? You must've thought her
wedding ring was a little strange.

518
00:49:20,223 --> 00:49:24,057
Oh, man. Listen, I apologized
to you months ago.

519
00:49:24,227 --> 00:49:28,425
I know you don't want me in your life.
I don't want you in mine either.

520
00:49:28,598 --> 00:49:31,999
But until this little divorce thing's
done, not much we can do about it.

521
00:49:32,169 --> 00:49:37,232
But I will not let you upset Amy
any more than you already have.

522
00:49:37,407 --> 00:49:41,138
So why don't we just wrap this thing
up and get out of each other's lives--?

523
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:48,148
Are we getting the message
I'm sending?

524
00:49:49,353 --> 00:49:50,843
Where are we from, Teddy?

525
00:49:52,589 --> 00:49:53,988
Tennessee...

526
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:55,920
...Morty.

527
00:49:57,794 --> 00:49:59,455
I was gonna say Mississippi.

528
00:50:00,197 --> 00:50:04,793
No. Long way from there.
Little place called Shooter's Bay.

529
00:50:25,255 --> 00:50:26,779
Come on, Karsch.

530
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:30,323
Five hundred dollars a day.
Where are you when I need you?

531
00:50:57,587 --> 00:50:58,918
What--?

532
00:51:00,657 --> 00:51:02,648
What fresh hell...?

533
00:51:02,826 --> 00:51:05,226
-Yeah?
-Where you been all day?

534
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:07,992
I might ask you the same question.

535
00:51:08,165 --> 00:51:11,100
Relax, you're fine.
I checked the cabin an hour ago.

536
00:51:11,268 --> 00:51:13,998
Well, he showed up an hour
after you left last night.

537
00:51:14,171 --> 00:51:16,298
Oh, really?
Then he had a busy night.

538
00:51:16,673 --> 00:51:19,665
My office called me about
your Riverdale house. I'm sorry.

539
00:51:19,843 --> 00:51:23,006
The worst part is, I hadn't had
a chance to get the magazine out.

540
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:25,205
The one with the story he says I stole.

541
00:51:25,382 --> 00:51:26,849
That's gone up in smoke now.

542
00:51:27,017 --> 00:51:30,350
Do you still want to go through with it?
Meeting? Showing him the magazine?

543
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:31,919
Hell, yes, man.

544
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:35,581
I've had a shitty year.
I want it settled now. Everything.

545
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:38,489
Good. I called your agent
when I heard about the house.

546
00:51:38,662 --> 00:51:41,028
I figured he'd have a copy
of the magazine.

547
00:51:41,198 --> 00:51:44,190
He sent the original by UPS
overnight today.

548
00:51:44,367 --> 00:51:46,198
You can pick it up tomorrow after 3.

549
00:51:46,369 --> 00:51:48,064
I knew there was a reason I hired you.

550
00:51:48,238 --> 00:51:49,466
There's something else.

551
00:51:50,307 --> 00:51:52,707
I caught up with your
Tom Greenleaf today.

552
00:51:52,876 --> 00:51:55,538
The guy who drove past you
and Shooter on the lake road.

553
00:51:55,712 --> 00:51:57,111
Well, he's a weird one.

554
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,477
First he says he did go down
to the Lake Drive on Tuesday...

555
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:02,515
...and he saw you like you said.

556
00:52:02,686 --> 00:52:04,711
But then he gets nervous and says:

557
00:52:04,888 --> 00:52:07,721
"No, come to think of it, I didn't.
Didn't see anybody.

558
00:52:07,891 --> 00:52:09,984
Wasn't even on Lake Drive
on Tuesday."

559
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:14,290
Yeah, well, Tom's old.
Maybe just slipped his mind.

560
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:15,761
Don't be naive.

561
00:52:15,932 --> 00:52:18,662
He was scared shitless.
Somebody got to him.

562
00:52:18,835 --> 00:52:20,462
Come on, wait.

563
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:23,902
Why would Shooter care if
Tom Greenleaf knows he's here?

564
00:52:24,074 --> 00:52:26,542
-Well, it depends.
-On what?

565
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:28,837
On what he plans to do to you.

566
00:52:29,012 --> 00:52:32,573
I'm revising my opinion, Mort.
I don't think Shooter's just some nut.

567
00:52:32,749 --> 00:52:37,083
We need to consider the possibility
that he was hired to do this.

568
00:52:37,254 --> 00:52:41,850
Somebody with a grudge against you
hires a tough guy to rattle you...

569
00:52:42,025 --> 00:52:43,822
...scare you to death.

570
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:46,292
But he hires the wrong guy.

571
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:48,790
Things get out of control.

572
00:52:48,965 --> 00:52:51,433
They go further than
they're supposed to.

573
00:52:51,601 --> 00:52:53,262
Dead dogs...

574
00:52:53,436 --> 00:52:55,427
...burnt-down houses.

575
00:52:56,072 --> 00:52:57,733
Now he can't call him off.

576
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:02,171
-Ted.
-Who?

577
00:53:03,146 --> 00:53:04,613
Ted. Amy's Ted.

578
00:53:04,781 --> 00:53:07,113
The Ted that Amy left me for.

579
00:53:07,751 --> 00:53:10,982
That's why he calls himself Shooter.
Ted wants me to know it's him.

580
00:53:11,154 --> 00:53:13,952
He's trying to intimidate me,
trying to send me a message.

581
00:53:14,124 --> 00:53:16,456
-Why? What does he want?
-I don't know.

582
00:53:16,793 --> 00:53:18,556
Did you piss him off?

583
00:53:21,631 --> 00:53:23,963
-I might have.
-Okay, here's what we do.

584
00:53:24,734 --> 00:53:27,032
What proof do you have
that Shooter was there?

585
00:53:27,337 --> 00:53:31,137
Other than the manuscript.
Physical evidence, I'm talking about.

586
00:53:31,341 --> 00:53:34,777
Bruises. I got bruises on my arms
from where he grabbed me.

587
00:53:34,945 --> 00:53:36,378
All right.

588
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:40,015
You and me are going to
go see Greenleaf together.

589
00:53:40,183 --> 00:53:41,411
All right.

590
00:53:41,585 --> 00:53:44,145
Bring the manuscript.
Bring your bruises.

591
00:53:44,321 --> 00:53:47,779
I'm gonna push the guy hard,
make it impossible for him to lie.

592
00:53:47,958 --> 00:53:50,984
If he'll tell the police he was
threatened too, we've got something.

593
00:53:52,329 --> 00:53:53,887
Bowie's store, breakfast?

594
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:55,395
9 a.m. sharp.

595
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:56,827
I'll see you there.

596
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,490
And bring your six-gun, pilgrim.

597
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:12,675
It is a good ending.

598
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:30,092
Oh, shit.

599
00:55:01,431 --> 00:55:02,659
Shit.

600
00:56:24,748 --> 00:56:26,272
Pall Mall.

601
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:29,215
Cracker bastard.

602
00:56:56,846 --> 00:56:58,177
Sorry.

603
00:57:05,822 --> 00:57:07,289
Ken?

604
00:57:13,229 --> 00:57:14,594
Tom?

605
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:43,019
Would you like a pack?

606
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:45,788
I don't smoke.

607
00:57:49,332 --> 00:57:51,766
Did a guy come in here
looking for me around 9:00?

608
00:57:51,935 --> 00:57:55,200
-No.
-Big guy, kind of a New York-cop type.

609
00:57:55,371 --> 00:57:57,396
No. No, that doesn't ring a bell.

610
00:57:57,574 --> 00:57:58,836
I overslept.

611
00:57:59,008 --> 00:58:01,977
Well, maybe he did too,
because he wasn't here.

612
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:05,408
Yeah.

613
00:58:50,426 --> 00:58:51,654
What are you doing here?

614
00:58:51,828 --> 00:58:54,558
Matter of fact, I was just on my way
over to your place.

615
00:58:56,266 --> 00:58:57,494
Where's your buddy?

616
00:58:58,701 --> 00:59:01,397
-Came alone.
-Sure you did.

617
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:12,377
I know what you're up to.

618
00:59:16,986 --> 00:59:18,681
Look, Mort....

619
00:59:19,789 --> 00:59:22,917
A lot of what's going on right now
is my fault.

620
00:59:23,293 --> 00:59:25,124
Most of it, in fact.

621
00:59:26,095 --> 00:59:27,323
What do you want?

622
00:59:29,933 --> 00:59:31,594
I want you out of our life.

623
00:59:33,269 --> 00:59:35,533
Gotta sign your papers, Mort.

624
00:59:38,875 --> 00:59:41,969
My divorce papers?
Tell her to send them to my lawyer.

625
00:59:42,145 --> 00:59:45,137
She did. He said that you won't return
his calls for weeks.

626
00:59:45,315 --> 00:59:47,943
-This is about the settlement?
-Just calm down.

627
00:59:48,117 --> 00:59:49,778
-Money?
-It's not about money.

628
00:59:49,953 --> 00:59:52,217
This is about getting this thing done.

629
00:59:52,388 --> 00:59:55,323
Because I'm afraid if we don't,
who knows where it might go.

630
00:59:55,491 --> 00:59:56,924
I think you know what I mean.

631
00:59:57,093 --> 00:59:59,687
Well, Teddy, I think I do,
but here's the problem:

632
00:59:59,862 --> 01:00:03,559
I don't respond well to intimidation.
Makes me feel icky. You know?

633
01:00:05,802 --> 01:00:09,135
You know, I'm attempting to have
a normal conversation here.

634
01:00:09,305 --> 01:00:10,897
I buried my dog, mister.

635
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:16,272
This whole thing is out of your
control now. You know it, I know it.

636
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:18,778
You started this shit,
I'm gonna finish it.

637
01:00:19,816 --> 01:00:23,650
Now, do me a favor, go back
and tell that to your filthy little friend.

638
01:00:26,022 --> 01:00:27,319
God!

639
01:00:28,057 --> 01:00:29,922
Bummer, Ted.

640
01:01:07,864 --> 01:01:10,731
-Yeah?
-Go to where we met the other day.

641
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:12,868
Walk down the path a little way.

642
01:01:13,036 --> 01:01:16,301
-Why?
-I'll catch up with you this afternoon.

643
01:01:16,472 --> 01:01:19,873
Anybody you call between
now and then is your responsibility.

644
01:02:08,024 --> 01:02:09,457
T om?

645
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:17,025
Greenleaf?

646
01:03:00,843 --> 01:03:02,811
Quarter past 2.

647
01:03:04,013 --> 01:03:06,311
You been out about three hours.

648
01:03:07,049 --> 01:03:10,678
Your leg's sleeping.
You laid on the damn thing.

649
01:03:10,853 --> 01:03:14,016
Now, I would have moved you,
but I didn't want to wake you.

650
01:03:14,190 --> 01:03:15,782
Got tired of waiting.

651
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:18,984
Almost pinned a note on you.
Decided not to.

652
01:03:19,162 --> 01:03:20,754
You scare too easy.

653
01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:23,728
I wouldn't go too far if I were you.

654
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:27,165
I hooked you to those two men
in more ways than you know.

655
01:03:27,336 --> 01:03:29,133
You're insane.
I'm going to the police.

656
01:03:29,305 --> 01:03:33,332
Whose screwdriver you think
is in that fella's head?

657
01:03:35,578 --> 01:03:37,705
If you leave them here
and I disappear...

658
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:40,678
...you'll find yourself standing
with your head in the noose...

659
01:03:40,850 --> 01:03:42,909
...and your feet in Crisco.

660
01:03:43,519 --> 01:03:45,146
What do you want from me?

661
01:03:45,321 --> 01:03:47,881
Why, I told you that already,
Mr. Rainey.

662
01:03:48,057 --> 01:03:51,857
I want you to fix my story.
The one you stole.

663
01:03:52,028 --> 01:03:53,723
Or ain't you ready to admit it yet?

664
01:03:54,363 --> 01:03:57,560
I did not steal your story.

665
01:03:57,733 --> 01:04:01,601
I expect you'll let yourself
go to Greenhaven for murder...

666
01:04:01,771 --> 01:04:03,170
...before you'll admit it.

667
01:04:03,539 --> 01:04:05,700
I have the magazine, you lunatic!

668
01:04:05,875 --> 01:04:07,433
I have the magazine!

669
01:04:07,610 --> 01:04:10,909
I have the goddamn magazine!

670
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:14,345
You have this so-called magazine
right now?

671
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:16,610
On me, no.

672
01:04:16,986 --> 01:04:18,647
I was gonna go pick it up at 3:00.

673
01:04:19,388 --> 01:04:21,982
There can't be any magazine.

674
01:04:22,225 --> 01:04:25,991
Not with that story in it.
That story is mine.

675
01:04:26,829 --> 01:04:30,060
What do you want? To kill me?
Why don't you just do it? Just kill me.

676
01:04:30,233 --> 01:04:31,894
No, sir.

677
01:04:32,068 --> 01:04:34,935
These others here were gonna
get in the way of our business.

678
01:04:35,104 --> 01:04:36,935
I couldn't have that.

679
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:40,073
You bring me that story...

680
01:04:40,509 --> 01:04:42,101
...if it exists.

681
01:04:42,278 --> 01:04:43,711
Your house in two hours.

682
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:48,214
You got some heavy lifting here first.
I'd get to it if I were you.

683
01:04:48,784 --> 01:04:50,581
By the way...

684
01:04:50,753 --> 01:04:53,244
...if you talk to that sheriff
of yours again...

685
01:04:53,422 --> 01:04:56,391
...or if you don't show up at 4:00...

686
01:04:56,792 --> 01:04:59,590
...I will burn your life
and every person in it...

687
01:04:59,762 --> 01:05:02,754
...Iike a cane field in a high wind.

688
01:05:04,033 --> 01:05:07,230
When I show you the magazine that
has my name on the contents page...

689
01:05:07,403 --> 01:05:09,997
...with my story inside...

690
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:13,570
-...then what?
-Then I turn myself in.

691
01:05:13,843 --> 01:05:16,971
But I'd take care of myself
before a trial, Mr. Rainey.

692
01:05:17,146 --> 01:05:19,273
Because if things turn out that way...

693
01:05:19,448 --> 01:05:22,144
...then I suppose I am crazy.

694
01:05:22,685 --> 01:05:24,812
And that kind of crazy man...

695
01:05:24,987 --> 01:05:28,081
...has no reason or excuse to live.

696
01:05:30,826 --> 01:05:32,384
Listen, you got my hat.

697
01:05:32,561 --> 01:05:35,621
I want it, one way or the other.

698
01:08:15,624 --> 01:08:17,819
-Hello?
-Mort?

699
01:08:18,594 --> 01:08:19,822
Yeah, hi.

700
01:08:20,129 --> 01:08:22,324
I've been so worried about you.
Are you okay?

701
01:08:22,498 --> 01:08:25,558
-I'm okay. I'm okay, Amy.
-Are you sure?

702
01:08:25,901 --> 01:08:29,496
When I saw you yesterday,
you seemed so strained. I mean....

703
01:08:31,474 --> 01:08:34,136
-What?
-Do you...?

704
01:08:35,644 --> 01:08:39,136
Do you think things would've been
different if we hadn't lost the baby?

705
01:08:39,982 --> 01:08:43,076
Jesus Christ, I don't--
Amy, I don't know.

706
01:08:43,252 --> 01:08:46,619
Let me call you later. I gotta go.
I gotta be somewhere.

707
01:08:48,557 --> 01:08:51,082
What? What is it, Amy?

708
01:08:52,828 --> 01:08:55,490
Breathe. Breathe.

709
01:08:55,664 --> 01:08:57,222
Take a breath.

710
01:08:59,068 --> 01:09:01,161
Where are you? You at Ted's?

711
01:09:01,337 --> 01:09:02,736
Yeah.

712
01:09:04,039 --> 01:09:06,371
How we feeling about
old Ted these days?

713
01:09:09,445 --> 01:09:11,242
I don't know.

714
01:09:12,581 --> 01:09:13,980
I love him, I guess.

715
01:09:17,620 --> 01:09:20,612
-That's good.
-I didn't go with other men, you know.

716
01:09:20,789 --> 01:09:23,485
I always wanted to tell you
that I didn't go with other men.

717
01:09:23,859 --> 01:09:27,386
Only T ed, and only the last few months
after you and me were already over.

718
01:09:27,563 --> 01:09:31,260
If we were over while we were still
together, you might've mentioned it...

719
01:09:31,433 --> 01:09:32,730
...because it was news to me.

720
01:09:32,902 --> 01:09:35,370
That's because you weren't
there anymore.

721
01:09:35,538 --> 01:09:37,062
You were gone all the time.

722
01:09:37,239 --> 01:09:38,831
I worked at home, Amy!

723
01:09:39,008 --> 01:09:41,636
That's not what I mean.

724
01:09:42,611 --> 01:09:45,205
Even when you were with me,
you were gone, up in your head.

725
01:09:45,381 --> 01:09:49,579
I don't think that I looked in your eyes
and saw you looking back at me...

726
01:09:49,752 --> 01:09:52,118
...I mean, really with me,
for the last two years.

727
01:09:52,288 --> 01:09:55,485
You know what, you're right.
You're absolutely right. It's all my fault.

728
01:09:55,658 --> 01:09:58,559
No. I was a chickenshit.

729
01:10:01,130 --> 01:10:05,430
Ted wanted us to tell you together.
He kept asking, I kept putting it off.

730
01:10:06,302 --> 01:10:09,169
I'll never forget that look
on your face.

731
01:10:09,405 --> 01:10:10,895
Get out! Get out!

732
01:10:11,507 --> 01:10:13,668
-I gotta go.
-Mort, wait. Can't we just--?

733
01:10:13,842 --> 01:10:15,639
No! I've gotta go.

734
01:10:15,811 --> 01:10:18,541
-Will you call me if you need me?
-I doubt it.

735
01:10:18,714 --> 01:10:21,581
-Can I come up there?
-Why on earth would you do that?

736
01:10:22,885 --> 01:10:25,547
You still haven't signed
the papers yet, Mort.

737
01:10:26,088 --> 01:10:28,420
I know you don't want to deal with it.
Me neither.

738
01:10:28,591 --> 01:10:31,458
But everything's been negotiated.
We don't disagree on a thing.

739
01:10:31,627 --> 01:10:34,926
I don't understand why you won't sign.
Don't you want to get it over with?

740
01:10:35,097 --> 01:10:36,655
Unbelievable.

741
01:10:37,433 --> 01:10:40,197
You were worried about me,
and I believed you.

742
01:10:40,369 --> 01:10:42,462
-What an idiot.
-I am worried.

743
01:10:42,638 --> 01:10:46,768
You sound like you did six months
ago, and I think it's my fault.

744
01:10:46,942 --> 01:10:50,275
It's my fault, and I wish
I could take it back, but I can't.

745
01:10:50,446 --> 01:10:52,414
I guess you shouldn't have
fucked him, then!

746
01:11:04,293 --> 01:11:05,726
You're not going up there?

747
01:11:05,894 --> 01:11:08,362
I am not going to
dance around this anymore.

748
01:11:08,530 --> 01:11:12,523
Once he signs, it'll be over. We won't
have these horrible conversations.

749
01:11:12,701 --> 01:11:14,430
All right, well, I'm going with you.

750
01:11:14,603 --> 01:11:18,664
I just.... I really think
I should go alone, Ted.

751
01:11:18,841 --> 01:11:20,638
Well, that makes no sense.

752
01:11:20,809 --> 01:11:23,141
Just the sight of you
is gonna send him.

753
01:11:23,312 --> 01:11:26,304
I was married to the guy for 1 0 years,
I know how to talk to him.

754
01:11:26,482 --> 01:11:28,916
All I want is for this to be over.

755
01:11:29,752 --> 01:11:31,379
Excuse me.

756
01:11:32,221 --> 01:11:34,485
I'll be back around 7.

757
01:11:49,938 --> 01:11:51,462
Hey, Mr. Rainey!

758
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:53,369
-I'd like to--
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

759
01:11:59,114 --> 01:12:00,877
Hey. Mr. Rainey.

760
01:12:03,786 --> 01:12:05,720
Mr. Rainey, are you all right?

761
01:12:06,055 --> 01:12:09,115
I'm sorry, my throat just
double-clutched on me for a second.

762
01:12:09,291 --> 01:12:11,623
-You're very pale.
-Yeah, thank you.

763
01:12:11,794 --> 01:12:15,252
Did the UPS guy
drop anything off for me?

764
01:12:16,632 --> 01:12:19,066
-Just the one thing.
-Pardon me?

765
01:12:20,235 --> 01:12:21,532
Just the one thing, I said.

766
01:12:21,704 --> 01:12:23,865
-Oh. Yeah. Thank you.
-Welcome.

767
01:12:24,039 --> 01:12:27,497
Post office would have a cow if they
knew we handled the UPS guy's stuff.

768
01:12:27,676 --> 01:12:30,509
I know that,
and I certainly appreciate it.

769
01:12:30,913 --> 01:12:32,710
You won't tell them, will you?

770
01:12:33,349 --> 01:12:35,283
-No way.
-Good.

771
01:12:36,051 --> 01:12:38,110
Because I saw what you did.

772
01:12:43,859 --> 01:12:46,225
-I'm sorry?
-I said, they'd shoot me if you did.

773
01:12:47,696 --> 01:12:50,096
You ought to go home and lie down,
Mr. Rainey.

774
01:12:50,299 --> 01:12:51,561
You don't look well at all.

775
01:12:52,201 --> 01:12:55,398
Yeah, that's.... That's a good idea.

776
01:13:00,075 --> 01:13:01,303
Cute.

777
01:13:17,893 --> 01:13:20,919
-Got a minute?
-Well, no. I really don't right now.

778
01:13:21,096 --> 01:13:23,155
But I'll give you a call later.

779
01:13:24,733 --> 01:13:26,758
Okay. Sure.

780
01:13:32,374 --> 01:13:34,774
I'm gonna call you
on the phone, okay?

781
01:13:42,217 --> 01:13:43,809
Okay.

782
01:14:14,716 --> 01:14:17,014
Nineteen ninety-five.

783
01:14:18,020 --> 01:14:19,487
Contents.

784
01:14:21,890 --> 01:14:24,324
Eighty-three. Eighty-three.

785
01:14:28,597 --> 01:14:29,928
Eighty-one.

786
01:14:30,499 --> 01:14:31,932
Eighty-two.

787
01:14:32,568 --> 01:14:34,661
Ninety-nine.

788
01:14:40,242 --> 01:14:42,107
Ninety-nine.

789
01:14:43,412 --> 01:14:44,970
You cut it out.

790
01:14:46,415 --> 01:14:48,747
You son of a bitch.

791
01:14:52,187 --> 01:14:53,677
You cut it...

792
01:14:54,790 --> 01:14:56,587
...out of the magazine.

793
01:14:57,659 --> 01:15:00,651
Wait a minute.
How would he do that?

794
01:15:01,129 --> 01:15:02,824
I don't know...

795
01:15:04,099 --> 01:15:05,589
...but he did it.

796
01:15:06,368 --> 01:15:08,097
Think about it.

797
01:15:09,638 --> 01:15:11,003
How?

798
01:15:12,774 --> 01:15:14,537
I don't know.

799
01:15:57,653 --> 01:15:59,450
Why'd you put it on?

800
01:16:00,022 --> 01:16:01,546
I don't know.

801
01:16:02,057 --> 01:16:03,820
Maybe he wanted you to.

802
01:16:03,992 --> 01:16:06,153
Why would he want me
to put his hat on?

803
01:16:06,328 --> 01:16:08,159
Maybe he wants you to....

804
01:16:08,997 --> 01:16:10,658
Maybe he wants me to what?

805
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:13,167
To get confused.

806
01:16:13,335 --> 01:16:16,736
Oh, I'm already confused, pilgrim.
Plenty confused.

807
01:16:16,939 --> 01:16:18,998
So don't talk to me about confusion.

808
01:16:19,174 --> 01:16:23,008
Wait a minute. Back up just a sec.
What about that?

809
01:16:23,378 --> 01:16:24,868
What about what?

810
01:16:25,047 --> 01:16:27,743
Well, "pilgrim." "Shooter's Bay."

811
01:16:27,916 --> 01:16:30,578
And the half a dozen other details
you've chosen to ignore.

812
01:16:30,752 --> 01:16:34,848
You know what? You're nuts. I don't
need to listen to this shit from you.

813
01:16:35,023 --> 01:16:37,048
Are all these things coincidences?

814
01:16:37,225 --> 01:16:39,352
I'm wearing his bruises, aren't l?

815
01:16:39,728 --> 01:16:42,253
-Aren't l?
-Are you?

816
01:16:43,298 --> 01:16:44,526
Well....

817
01:16:50,372 --> 01:16:52,203
This doesn't make any sense.

818
01:16:52,374 --> 01:16:56,367
Would you like to hear something that
does make sense? Call the police.

819
01:16:56,545 --> 01:17:00,106
Call Dave Newsome, tell him to come
here this second and lock you up...

820
01:17:00,282 --> 01:17:02,546
...before you can do
any more damage.

821
01:17:02,718 --> 01:17:04,982
I'm gonna get a knife
and cut you out of me.

822
01:17:05,787 --> 01:17:08,312
Before you kill anyone else.

823
01:17:09,324 --> 01:17:11,258
I didn't kill anybody.

824
01:17:16,965 --> 01:17:19,559
-You had a gun.
-Wasn't loaded.

825
01:17:19,735 --> 01:17:21,498
-Really?
-No.

826
01:17:21,670 --> 01:17:24,230
You almost killed them.
You wanted to.

827
01:17:24,406 --> 01:17:25,998
The gun was not loaded!

828
01:17:26,174 --> 01:17:27,903
-You still want to.
-Shut up!

829
01:17:28,076 --> 01:17:30,442
Listen to me.
Because this is how it happens.

830
01:17:30,612 --> 01:17:32,671
-This is how it happens to people.
-Shut up!

831
01:17:32,848 --> 01:17:35,442
There is no John Shooter.

832
01:17:37,019 --> 01:17:39,886
There never has been.
You invented him.

833
01:17:40,455 --> 01:17:43,322
Listen to me, not to him,
before it's too late.

834
01:17:43,492 --> 01:17:44,754
Leave me alone!

835
01:17:48,597 --> 01:17:50,565
You are alone.

836
01:18:11,553 --> 01:18:13,145
You're not handling this.

837
01:18:13,455 --> 01:18:14,854
What you're doing is wrong.

838
01:18:15,023 --> 01:18:16,547
You have no idea
what you're doing.

839
01:18:16,725 --> 01:18:21,219
You've been eating potato chips
this way for 30 years. For 30 years.

840
01:18:26,435 --> 01:18:28,494
Sister found out about
the broken window.

841
01:18:28,670 --> 01:18:30,968
The school had to be withdrawn
from the competition.

842
01:18:31,139 --> 01:18:33,937
Sister found out about
the broken windows.

843
01:18:34,109 --> 01:18:38,671
Then she got up from the table.
We didn't talk for the rest of the night.

844
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:41,212
Todd Downey thought a woman
who'd steal your love--

845
01:18:41,383 --> 01:18:43,510
-What does Todd have to do with it?
-Everything.

846
01:18:43,685 --> 01:18:45,380
I'm starting to believe
Todd was right.

847
01:18:45,554 --> 01:18:48,022
Everything that you're doing
is wrong.

848
01:18:49,191 --> 01:18:51,125
What is happening to me?

849
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:56,964
Oh, I think you know.
I think you have a real good idea.

850
01:18:57,766 --> 01:18:58,994
You don't exist.

851
01:18:59,167 --> 01:19:03,035
Me? I exist, Mr. Rainey.

852
01:19:03,905 --> 01:19:06,965
I exist because you made me.

853
01:19:07,275 --> 01:19:10,073
-Check it out.
-You thought me up.

854
01:19:10,245 --> 01:19:12,440
I'm a dairy farmer from Mississippi.

855
01:19:12,614 --> 01:19:14,275
Gave me my name.

856
01:19:14,616 --> 01:19:17,642
Told me everything
you wanted me to do.

857
01:19:30,499 --> 01:19:33,900
I did them things
so you wouldn't have to.

858
01:19:34,069 --> 01:19:36,333
Right up there, Tom.
We were standing right there.

859
01:19:36,505 --> 01:19:38,336
Yeah, I know, Mort. I saw you.

860
01:19:38,507 --> 01:19:41,340
I didn't want to say it in front of him,
but you were alone.

861
01:19:42,410 --> 01:19:46,710
I know, Tom. Look, just pull over for a
second. I want to show you something.

862
01:19:49,518 --> 01:19:53,682
Didn't have the stomach to do it
yourself, but you knew I did.

863
01:19:56,324 --> 01:19:57,757
Are we done yet?

864
01:19:57,926 --> 01:20:00,952
We got things all cleaned up
around here?

865
01:20:01,530 --> 01:20:04,192
What's the real reason I come for?

866
01:20:06,001 --> 01:20:08,936
-Fix the story.
-That's right.

867
01:20:09,971 --> 01:20:11,199
Fix the ending.

868
01:20:11,540 --> 01:20:12,939
Got to fix the ending.

869
01:20:13,108 --> 01:20:16,202
And how exactly do you suppose
we ought to do that?

870
01:20:40,969 --> 01:20:42,459
Mort?

871
01:21:30,418 --> 01:21:31,976
Mort?

872
01:21:34,155 --> 01:21:36,885
Are you there?
I saw your car outside.

873
01:21:41,162 --> 01:21:42,686
Hello?

874
01:22:09,524 --> 01:22:11,082
Mort?

875
01:22:16,998 --> 01:22:18,226
Chico?

876
01:22:43,458 --> 01:22:45,483
That explains a lot.

877
01:22:49,130 --> 01:22:50,529
What the hell?

878
01:24:18,053 --> 01:24:19,543
Hi.

879
01:24:26,494 --> 01:24:28,485
Jesus, Mort.

880
01:24:31,666 --> 01:24:33,497
Where'd you get that old thing?
The attic?

881
01:24:33,802 --> 01:24:35,565
It's mine.

882
01:24:36,604 --> 01:24:38,765
Wasn't ever anybody else's.

883
01:24:41,443 --> 01:24:43,411
Mort, what's wrong?

884
01:24:43,578 --> 01:24:46,012
You got you a wrong number, missus.

885
01:24:47,816 --> 01:24:49,044
Ain't no Mort here.

886
01:24:49,918 --> 01:24:51,180
Mort's dead.

887
01:24:51,853 --> 01:24:53,411
He did a lot of squirming around...

888
01:24:53,588 --> 01:24:57,991
...but in the end he couldn't lie to
himself anymore, let alone to me.

889
01:24:58,159 --> 01:25:01,356
Now, I never put a hand on him,
missus. I swear.

890
01:25:01,529 --> 01:25:03,190
He took the coward's way out.

891
01:25:03,364 --> 01:25:06,128
-Why are you talking this way?
-That's just the way I talk.

892
01:25:06,401 --> 01:25:07,629
You're scaring me.

893
01:25:07,802 --> 01:25:10,464
It don't matter.
You won't be scared long.

894
01:25:28,156 --> 01:25:29,418
Oh, God. Oh, God.

895
01:26:00,588 --> 01:26:02,488
Help!

896
01:26:08,396 --> 01:26:11,422
I'm about done fussing with you.

897
01:26:26,848 --> 01:26:29,282
I am so sorry, missus...

898
01:26:29,450 --> 01:26:31,782
...but right is right
and fair is fair...

899
01:26:31,953 --> 01:26:33,944
...and something has got to be done.

900
01:26:36,090 --> 01:26:39,082
By the way, I want you to know
that none of this was my idea.

901
01:26:39,260 --> 01:26:40,955
It was Mr. Rainey all along.

902
01:26:41,129 --> 01:26:43,290
You are Mort Rainey.

903
01:26:43,464 --> 01:26:45,091
I got a place for you.

904
01:26:45,266 --> 01:26:47,257
You are Mort Rainey.

905
01:26:47,435 --> 01:26:49,403
I got it all picked out.

906
01:26:50,772 --> 01:26:52,967
You are Mort Rainey.

907
01:27:04,652 --> 01:27:06,244
Mort....

908
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:14,050
Amy?

909
01:27:16,864 --> 01:27:19,094
-Amy?
-Ted.

910
01:27:22,403 --> 01:27:25,372
-Amy?
-Ted! No!

911
01:27:41,122 --> 01:27:42,783
No!

912
01:27:51,966 --> 01:27:55,094
"'l know I can do it,'
Todd Downey said...

913
01:27:56,037 --> 01:28:00,303
...helping himself to another ear
of corn from the steaming bowl.

914
01:28:02,010 --> 01:28:04,410
'I'm sure that in time...

915
01:28:06,047 --> 01:28:09,039
...her death will be a mystery...

916
01:28:10,618 --> 01:28:12,552
...even to me."'

917
01:28:32,173 --> 01:28:33,572
Hi.

918
01:28:34,409 --> 01:28:35,899
Hi.

919
01:28:42,650 --> 01:28:43,878
I'm kind of late.

920
01:28:53,394 --> 01:28:54,793
Hi.

921
01:28:55,363 --> 01:28:56,796
Hi.

922
01:28:57,365 --> 01:28:59,333
-Braces.
-Yeah.

923
01:28:59,500 --> 01:29:01,627
Getting a few things
straightened out.

924
01:29:06,507 --> 01:29:11,535
I was kind of wondering if sometime
you might possibly be interested in--

925
01:29:11,713 --> 01:29:13,840
I don't need a bag.

926
01:29:44,112 --> 01:29:45,841
Mr. Rainey?

927
01:29:47,982 --> 01:29:50,712
Your front door's open.
I'm coming in.

928
01:30:15,643 --> 01:30:17,270
Mr. Rainey?

929
01:30:18,579 --> 01:30:21,707
-Mort Rainey?
-Oh, hi, Dave.

930
01:30:22,817 --> 01:30:24,842
I didn't hear you.
Come on up.

931
01:30:27,855 --> 01:30:30,016
Glad you're here.
I could use the break.

932
01:30:30,191 --> 01:30:32,853
Working lunch. I'm on a roll.

933
01:30:35,363 --> 01:30:36,660
Yeah.

934
01:30:38,332 --> 01:30:40,027
Both you and I know what you did.

935
01:30:42,136 --> 01:30:45,128
Maybe we don't have enough to
put you away now, but eventually...

936
01:30:46,040 --> 01:30:48,031
...we'll find those bodies.

937
01:30:48,209 --> 01:30:49,767
We'll tie you to them...

938
01:30:49,944 --> 01:30:51,639
...and you're going away.

939
01:30:53,381 --> 01:30:57,044
In the meantime, I'd appreciate it if
you didn't come into town anymore.

940
01:30:58,386 --> 01:30:59,978
Makes people uncomfortable.

941
01:31:02,857 --> 01:31:05,325
You can do your shopping
in New London.

942
01:31:07,695 --> 01:31:09,822
Did you hear what I said?

943
01:31:12,333 --> 01:31:15,029
Sure. No problem.

944
01:31:16,704 --> 01:31:18,171
You know...

945
01:31:18,940 --> 01:31:22,706
...the only thing that matters
is the ending.

946
01:31:23,010 --> 01:31:25,843
It's the most important part
of the story, the ending.

947
01:31:26,848 --> 01:31:28,338
And this one...

948
01:31:30,218 --> 01:31:31,913
...is very good.

949
01:31:34,889 --> 01:31:36,652
This one's perfect.

950
01:31:46,901 --> 01:31:49,631
"'I know I can do it, '
Todd Downey said...

951
01:31:49,804 --> 01:31:53,865
...helping himself to another ear
of corn from the steaming bowl.

952
01:31:54,709 --> 01:31:56,700
'I'm sure that in time...

953
01:31:57,245 --> 01:31:59,543
...every bit of her will be gone.

954
01:31:59,747 --> 01:32:02,841
And her death will be a mystery...

955
01:32:03,484 --> 01:32:05,042
...even to me. "'

956
