00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:13,638
When I was a little boy, my mom
used to play A Portrait of Merle Haggard

3
00:00:13,764 --> 00:00:15,891
every night before bed.

4
00:00:15,975 --> 00:00:18,894
Her favourite song was Silver Wings,

5
00:00:18,978 --> 00:00:22,647
so I figured I'd surprise her
and learn how to play it.

6
00:00:23,107 --> 00:00:26,860
I played that song day and night
until my fingers bled.

7
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:30,447
Finally, when I sat her down to play it,

8
00:00:31,115 --> 00:00:34,409
she waited until I was finished
and then she said,

9
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:36,828
"Merle sings it better, but keep trying."

10
00:00:39,165 --> 00:00:40,957
So I guess I am.

11
00:03:03,142 --> 00:03:04,851
Put it out, Beau.

12
00:03:05,186 --> 00:03:06,269
Yes, ma'am.

13
00:03:06,354 --> 00:03:10,023
Peterson went through withdrawal all over
the dogwood deck. It's got your name on it.

14
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:11,608
And Beau?

15
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:15,612
I don't want to see you
anywhere near Mrs Canter's room.

16
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,601
- The what? The what was wet?
- Go with it.

17
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:49,396
- What did you get wet?
- The stage was wet.

18
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,398
Oh, the stage was wet, right.

19
00:03:54,652 --> 00:03:55,819
I'm looking.

20
00:03:57,071 --> 00:03:59,072
- That's when it what?
- You keep messing me up here.

21
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:00,198
I'm sorry.

22
00:04:01,826 --> 00:04:03,326
- You know, here. You just...
- You were what?

23
00:04:03,411 --> 00:04:04,911
- You sing it.
- What were you going to say?

24
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:07,622
No, that was good.
Why are you giving this to me?

25
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:09,707
- Go on, please.
- What?

26
00:04:09,834 --> 00:04:12,210
I don't know. Make it yours.

27
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:15,088
I like that song.
What do you say when you start?

28
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:16,589
"I remember that day."

29
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:20,677
"I remember that day. When..." When what?

30
00:04:21,846 --> 00:04:23,763
"When we first met."

31
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:55,795
- How do you do that so fast?
- I didn't do anything.

32
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,048
- You were there. You had it already.
- Give me that.

33
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:00,592
"Timing is everything."

34
00:05:01,135 --> 00:05:04,387
- Try that one.
- I like that. That one was good.

35
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:31,247
Kell.

36
00:05:37,505 --> 00:05:38,922
What's going on?

37
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:42,342
This is Beau. Do you remember him?
He's one of my sponsors.

38
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:46,095
We were just messing around.

39
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:48,264
Of course.

40
00:05:48,766 --> 00:05:50,600
Hey, Beau. How are you doing?

41
00:05:54,939 --> 00:05:57,607
- Hey, beautiful.
- Hi.

42
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:02,779
Beau, would you mind getting
a couple bellhops for Kelly's bags?

43
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:06,115
- You got bellhops here, don't you?
- No, sir.

44
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,827
Well, then, do you mind?
Because the car's out front.

45
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:17,627
- They're letting me out early.
- Well, you still got another month left.

46
00:06:18,337 --> 00:06:21,589
- They think I'm better.
- Better than what?

47
00:06:21,674 --> 00:06:23,967
I was going to tell you. I was...

48
00:06:25,553 --> 00:06:28,388
I was just thinking,
"How am I going to tell you?"

49
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:29,806
Beau!

50
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:33,434
Are you Kelly's doctor? Because the last
I checked, Dr Stevens was taking care of her.

51
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:36,688
No, he's just being protective.
Aren't you, Beau?

52
00:06:36,814 --> 00:06:38,606
He's just being a good sponsor.

53
00:06:38,691 --> 00:06:40,733
Why don't you let me be the protective one,
all right, hoss?

54
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:42,485
Now, if you wouldn't mind,

55
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:46,239
I'd like to get some help with these bags
so we can get Kelly out of here.

56
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:49,993
She doesn't travel light,
in case you hadn't noticed.

57
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:03,256
The first two venues are small.

58
00:07:04,383 --> 00:07:06,676
We'll ease you back into it.

59
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,011
And the third?

60
00:07:09,013 --> 00:07:10,972
We're going to go back to Dallas, televised.

61
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:14,434
- What?
- Yeah, we're going to prove them all wrong.

62
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:19,731
Look, Kell, you're the toughest girl I know,
so if you tell me you're not ready,

63
00:07:19,857 --> 00:07:22,775
well, then, I'll take that at face value.

64
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:26,696
I want Beau to open for me.

65
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:28,906
Who's Beau?

66
00:07:29,033 --> 00:07:31,492
He's that kid you just met.
He's a singer. He's a good one.

67
00:07:31,577 --> 00:07:35,705
Well, why don't we get the gardener
to open for you? I'm sure he's good.

68
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,874
It's important to me.

69
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:41,544
Besides, I've already got an opener for you.

70
00:07:42,046 --> 00:07:43,630
Chiles Stanton.

71
00:07:44,256 --> 00:07:46,341
The beauty queen I was telling you about.

72
00:07:46,425 --> 00:07:49,469
She's playing tonight at The Stage,
and I'm going to go check her out.

73
00:07:49,553 --> 00:07:53,640
I'm sure you are.
You can check out Beau while you're there.

74
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:56,225
All right. Well, how about this? Look, I'll...

75
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:59,395
Hold on. I'll go check out Chiles tonight
and if it doesn't work out,

76
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,940
and if she doesn't blow me away,
then we'll look at other options.

77
00:08:03,067 --> 00:08:04,901
Don't placate me.

78
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:07,320
- I wouldn't dare.
- Yeah.

79
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,623
So, where did you find the bird?

80
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:21,417
Under a tree down there.

81
00:08:25,464 --> 00:08:27,924
I waited 20 minutes for her mama
to come back,

82
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:30,259
and when she didn't, I swooped her up.

83
00:08:30,594 --> 00:08:34,430
- I've been taking care of her ever since.
- It looks like a baby quail.

84
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,308
I've been calling her Loretta Lynn.

85
00:08:43,107 --> 00:08:45,108
What if I took her for just a little while?

86
00:08:46,694 --> 00:08:48,319
I'll take care of her.

87
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:54,951
You got a really big tour
that you need to get ready for.

88
00:08:55,536 --> 00:08:56,703
Okay.

89
00:08:57,663 --> 00:08:58,955
Hey.

90
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:03,042
- I got a good idea.
- What?

91
00:09:03,794 --> 00:09:05,128
Let's get out of here.

92
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,760
Let's go.

93
00:09:12,845 --> 00:09:16,514
Nashville's Kelly Canter was released,
once again, from rehab this morning.

94
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,976
You'll remember, the country music star
was arrested last year

95
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,646
for drunk and disorderly conduct
while performing at a show in Dallas.

96
00:09:23,731 --> 00:09:26,774
She was five months pregnant at the time.

97
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,153
Hi, guys. Hey. Hey, how are you doing?

98
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:31,529
Be careful.

99
00:09:32,156 --> 00:09:34,991
We can't wait to get on the road again.
We can't wait for the tour to start.

100
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:37,952
Kelly's feeling better than ever.
She's looking better than ever.

101
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:41,664
And it's going to be fun. We can't wait
to get in front of the fans again, okay?

102
00:09:41,749 --> 00:09:42,957
Thanks, guys. Take care.

103
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,293
James, what about the divorce rumours?

104
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:01,100
Hey, Beau.

105
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,643
What are you doing here?

106
00:10:02,728 --> 00:10:05,104
I couldn't just wait by the phone
for you to call, could I?

107
00:10:05,189 --> 00:10:08,399
I'm here to hear you sing.
And to support Chiles, of course.

108
00:10:08,484 --> 00:10:10,193
Chiles? What does she
got to do with tonight?

109
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:14,030
- You be nice, Beau. Find me after the show.
- All right.

110
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:28,419
Hi, Beau.

111
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:33,257
You better be here to wish me luck.

112
00:10:33,342 --> 00:10:36,677
I'm on the board.
I'm playing three songs tonight.

113
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:40,515
- Says who?
- Says James Canter, that's who.

114
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:42,934
- Bullshit.
- Bull-true.

115
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:46,646
I happen to be in consideration as
the new opening act for Miss Kelly Canter.

116
00:10:47,815 --> 00:10:51,317
James, my new manager,
booked me this gig as a rehearsal.

117
00:10:51,777 --> 00:10:55,738
Not that I need it. I've been ready
for this moment since I was four years old.

118
00:10:55,823 --> 00:10:58,866
The last time I saw you sing,
you froze up like an ice cube.

119
00:10:59,243 --> 00:11:03,871
That was seven and a half months ago.
And it was just that one time.

120
00:11:03,956 --> 00:11:08,000
I'm not playing county fairs any more.
I'm much more seasoned.

121
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:11,671
You don't have any songs.
You can't even play the guitar.

122
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:15,675
I've been writing songs.
I got a whole bunch of them right over there.

123
00:11:18,387 --> 00:11:21,556
Little Heartbreaker, Summer Girl,
Rinky Dinky Town.

124
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,850
These aren't songs,
these are rides at Disneyland.

125
00:11:29,857 --> 00:11:32,358
Clint, tell me Garth Brooks here
isn't opening up for me.

126
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:35,319
She's not. She's closing.
I can't do anything about it, either.

127
00:11:35,404 --> 00:11:38,948
- It's your place. You can tell her no.
- Not to James Canter, I can't.

128
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,325
So you're going to let this prom queen
get up on stage?

129
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,703
I mean, for Christ's sake,
Patsy Cline sang here.

130
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:45,663
I don't care
if she sings Yankee Doodle Dandy,

131
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:46,831
she's still going to play.

132
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:49,458
I'm not cutting your set, Beau.
You've got the same three songs.

133
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:53,212
Don't worry, Beau.

134
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:57,383
I have no intention
of stealing your invisible career.

135
00:11:57,801 --> 00:11:58,885
You see,

136
00:11:59,428 --> 00:12:00,887
I want one.

137
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:10,539
- Hey, you did make it. Good to see you.
- How are you doing?

138
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:11,791
We got a packed house tonight,

139
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:15,503
I got your favourite spot on the rail right
straight through here, and Chiles is up next.

140
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:17,046
Yeah, what do you hear about her?

141
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,340
Well, I saw her last Tuesday at Robert's.

142
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:23,511
And to tell you the truth, I don't know
which was bigger, the hair or the dress.

143
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:26,263
Hey, she could be a diamond in the rough,
you know?

144
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:28,224
Well, I ain't got much time for rough.

145
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:30,184
Yeah, I hear that.

146
00:13:31,103 --> 00:13:34,647
- Kelly's not coming?
- No, no, she needs her beauty rest.

147
00:13:35,691 --> 00:13:39,944
Well, I guess I can tell the bartender,
"Put the vodka back on the shelves."

148
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,366
Enjoy the show.

149
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:07,930
Thank you very much.

150
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:15,771
What are you waiting for?
You're up, Kilgore. Your band's there.

151
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:17,565
I was Miss Dallas, dummy.

152
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:20,943
Dallas, Kilgore, what's the difference?
Go get that career.

153
00:14:21,737 --> 00:14:24,780
- How do I look?
- Like a country Barbie.

154
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:27,074
Thank you.

155
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:28,784
All right.

156
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,496
This is it. This is my night.

157
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:35,666
Everything is about to change.

158
00:14:35,751 --> 00:14:37,543
Excuse me. Sorry.

159
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:40,463
Sorry.

160
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:43,090
Excuse me. Sorry.

161
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:46,927
Here we go.

162
00:14:48,764 --> 00:14:51,682
Hi, y'all. How are you doing tonight?

163
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:56,228
I'm Chiles Stanton.

164
00:14:56,897 --> 00:15:00,775
And what a beautiful crowd you are!

165
00:15:02,903 --> 00:15:07,073
I have a few new songs for you tonight,
and I hope you like them.

166
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:17,625
Watch this.

167
00:15:19,211 --> 00:15:20,628
I'm sorry.

168
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:24,924
Oh, my.

169
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:28,844
I'm so sorry.

170
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:31,931
One more time.

171
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:49,281
Do you think somebody could turn down
the lights a little bit? It's awful bright in here.

172
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:54,036
Okay.

173
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:57,623
Oh, shit.

174
00:15:57,707 --> 00:15:59,291
One more time.

175
00:16:20,397 --> 00:16:23,232
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

176
00:17:36,598 --> 00:17:38,641
Chiles Stanton, everybody!

177
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:55,491
No, that was fun up there, man.

178
00:18:00,872 --> 00:18:03,707
Actually, we're going to work on that.

179
00:18:09,381 --> 00:18:11,173
You two sounded good in there.

180
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:12,758
Yeah, thanks.

181
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:16,053
- Do you ever think about doing a duet?
- No.

182
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:18,013
Her good looks and your song writing...

183
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:20,683
The girl's more scared
than a church mouse, James.

184
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:22,518
Yeah, but once you get her wound up, boy...

185
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:26,230
We're no duo, man. I don't even know her.
I was just sleeping with her friend.

186
00:18:29,401 --> 00:18:31,986
Why don't you go on the road with us, Beau,

187
00:18:32,696 --> 00:18:35,531
get the hell out of these honky tonks,

188
00:18:35,991 --> 00:18:37,616
step up to the big leagues?

189
00:18:39,411 --> 00:18:41,120
I think your bird is hungry.

190
00:18:41,204 --> 00:18:42,246
Hey.

191
00:18:43,707 --> 00:18:46,500
This could be a hell of an opportunity
for you, you know that?

192
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:48,419
You know, I don't know
if this means anything to you,

193
00:18:48,503 --> 00:18:50,004
but I actually enjoy playing music,

194
00:18:50,088 --> 00:18:53,841
and it don't matter who it's for.
All the rest is just bullshit.

195
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:55,718
Bullshit.

196
00:18:56,177 --> 00:19:00,514
Why don't you try to play some
of that bullshit in a stadium full of people?

197
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:02,641
Then see if you got anything, hoss.

198
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:05,436
I like these people just fine.

199
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:08,772
I figured you'd say that.

200
00:19:15,947 --> 00:19:17,489
Beau, do you care about Kelly?

201
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:21,285
What are you getting at?

202
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:24,913
Look, I know her legs are still shaky.

203
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:27,541
I ain't stupid.

204
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:32,921
But I also know this is the only opportunity
she has to turn herself around,

205
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:36,425
maybe save her life.
And I thought, maybe since you were so

206
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:39,928
concerned about Kelly
and that you were her sponsor,

207
00:19:41,973 --> 00:19:45,351
that maybe you would come out
on the road and help me take care of her.

208
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,145
Maybe not.

209
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:27,309
Do you think Chiles Stanton is pretty?

210
00:20:27,394 --> 00:20:30,187
- Now, come on.
- No, I'm serious.

211
00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:33,857
I do. That's why I'm asking.

212
00:20:35,318 --> 00:20:38,529
I think she looks
like a young Linda Ronstadt.

213
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:42,324
Yeah, well, she's a talented kid.

214
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:47,371
Do you think I'm talented?

215
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:53,127
- What do you think?
- How talented do you think I am?

216
00:20:53,378 --> 00:20:55,546
Very talented.

217
00:20:55,964 --> 00:20:59,174
- On a scale of one to 10.
- A 10.

218
00:21:00,051 --> 00:21:03,762
-10's the lowest.
- All right, a one, then. Absolutely a one.

219
00:21:04,305 --> 00:21:08,142
- How about zero?
- Oh, you're definitely a zero.

220
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:10,144
For sure.

221
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:21,488
James?

222
00:21:25,368 --> 00:21:27,411
I'm sorry about Dallas.

223
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:32,791
So am I.

224
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:39,673
We should talk about it sometime.

225
00:21:48,433 --> 00:21:49,808
James?

226
00:21:53,688 --> 00:21:57,232
I just got one of those Brazilian bikini waxes.

227
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:02,446
I just took an Ambien.

228
00:22:04,616 --> 00:22:06,950
I'll see you in eight hours.

229
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,841
The first time I heard you sing,

230
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:28,055
I knew. I wasn't much of a church man,

231
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:31,558
but I thought that must be
what angels sound like.

232
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:36,188
I thought I'd died and gone to heaven.

233
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:40,275
- I love that story.
- That's good. Because it's true.

234
00:22:49,786 --> 00:22:53,288
- Kelly, how was rehab?
- Well, good, I hope.

235
00:22:53,373 --> 00:22:55,832
- Is it too soon for a comeback tour?
- Are the divorce rumours true?

236
00:22:55,917 --> 00:22:58,168
We couldn't be happier.
We've got three sold-out shows.

237
00:22:58,253 --> 00:23:01,380
We've got the hottest two acts in country
music to come around in a long time.

238
00:23:01,464 --> 00:23:03,590
And Texas has never seen anything this big.

239
00:23:03,675 --> 00:23:05,425
Kelly, how do you feel
about returning to Dallas?

240
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:07,886
I feel okay. I think it's going to be good.

241
00:23:07,971 --> 00:23:09,346
- Thanks.
- Thank you, Kelly.

242
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:12,933
- Anything else to say to your fans?
- I love y'all. Thanks for coming out.

243
00:23:13,017 --> 00:23:16,061
- Have you forgiven Kelly for Dallas?
- She looks great, doesn't she, guys?

244
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:18,438
Thank you so much. Thank you.

245
00:23:18,523 --> 00:23:20,774
Hi, James. Hi, Miss Kelly.

246
00:23:21,192 --> 00:23:23,360
Would you mind signing this for me, please?

247
00:23:23,444 --> 00:23:24,611
- Sure.
- Thank you so much.

248
00:23:24,988 --> 00:23:29,157
If you have any advice for a young artist
such as myself, I'd love to hear it.

249
00:23:29,242 --> 00:23:31,660
- I have some advice.
- And James has been so helpful.

250
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:34,621
I won't sell it on eBay or anything.

251
00:23:34,706 --> 00:23:37,708
I've just been a fan of yours
since I was a little girl.

252
00:23:37,792 --> 00:23:40,586
Thank you. Thank you so much.

253
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:44,923
This is amazing, James. It's so beautiful,
I don't even want to pee in the toilet.

254
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:48,385
You didn't think this was for you, did you?

255
00:23:49,387 --> 00:23:51,513
No! No.

256
00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:53,473
God, no.

257
00:23:53,558 --> 00:23:55,767
Okay. See you in Houston.

258
00:24:12,994 --> 00:24:15,203
What, you don't like your new band?

259
00:24:15,663 --> 00:24:18,832
I didn't need your help back at The Stage.
I would've done just fine.

260
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:20,626
I know. I know.

261
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:24,588
The only reason we're doing a duet
in Houston is because James liked the song.

262
00:24:24,672 --> 00:24:26,340
Yeah, I'm sure that's true.

263
00:24:37,101 --> 00:24:40,354
So, I was looking at the set list
for Dallas and I thought,

264
00:24:40,438 --> 00:24:43,065
what if I close the show with Coming Home?

265
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:46,485
- Well, we don't have Coming Home, Kell.
- Yeah, but, I mean, Bob's going give it to us.

266
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:49,529
We've given the guy enough
number-one singles. Thank you.

267
00:24:49,614 --> 00:24:53,617
Well, let's get through Houston first
and we'll see, okay? Thank you.

268
00:24:54,202 --> 00:24:57,371
I love Coming Home. I mean, I think
it should be my next single, don't you?

269
00:24:57,455 --> 00:25:00,624
Well, what I love is that Houston sold out
in 15 minutes. That's what I love.

270
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,334
Did I tell you that?

271
00:25:02,418 --> 00:25:06,254
Well, JJ, he thinks it's a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity, but I don't see it that way, Kelly.

272
00:25:06,339 --> 00:25:08,256
I think that we got a lot of things that...

273
00:25:08,341 --> 00:25:10,676
Kell? Hey!

274
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,971
Do you remember when we were like that?

275
00:25:17,809 --> 00:25:19,267
Did you hear anything I said?

276
00:25:20,228 --> 00:25:22,688
I think I weighed
about 60 pounds soaking wet,

277
00:25:22,772 --> 00:25:26,233
and I had that big old gap in my teeth
and knock-knees.

278
00:25:26,776 --> 00:25:30,570
You were the first boy
who ever told me I was beautiful.

279
00:25:31,656 --> 00:25:34,783
I remember your meat loaf.
Do you remember the first bite?

280
00:25:35,243 --> 00:25:37,285
Do you remember what was in the first bite
that I took?

281
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:41,623
I was 20 years old, James.
I was trying to be a good wife.

282
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:43,458
Damn.

283
00:25:43,543 --> 00:25:48,630
Nobody told me, "First you cook the dinner
and then you put on the Lee Press-on Nails."

284
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:55,220
I loved you so much,
I think I would've eaten it anyway.

285
00:25:57,348 --> 00:26:00,350
Do you ever wonder what would have
happened if we had stayed in Bristol?

286
00:26:01,561 --> 00:26:05,105
Yeah. I'd be selling insurance,
you'd be singing in the church choir,

287
00:26:05,356 --> 00:26:07,357
and we'd be miserable.

288
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:11,611
Kelly, you belong on stage,
singing in front of thousands of people.

289
00:26:12,822 --> 00:26:14,781
You're probably right.

290
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:16,908
I know I'm right.

291
00:26:26,586 --> 00:26:27,669
Up or down?

292
00:26:27,754 --> 00:26:31,840
I want it down and full. Like really...
Do you remember how it was in Little Rock?

293
00:26:32,216 --> 00:26:34,885
- How could I forget?
- Well, goddamn.

294
00:26:35,219 --> 00:26:36,428
Hey.

295
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:38,180
You like?

296
00:26:38,431 --> 00:26:40,640
Man, you look like
you're going to kick some ass.

297
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:42,017
Yeah!

298
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:44,936
That's what I told them.
I said I want to look strong.

299
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:47,355
You look strong as hell.

300
00:26:50,443 --> 00:26:53,236
Hey, guys, can I talk to Beau alone
for a minute?

301
00:26:58,785 --> 00:27:01,119
Okay, girls, let's clear the room.

302
00:27:01,454 --> 00:27:03,789
- Just a second, okay?
- No problem.

303
00:27:04,582 --> 00:27:06,249
What are you doing?

304
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:09,503
I want you to make me a promise.

305
00:27:09,587 --> 00:27:10,796
Okay.

306
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:14,257
Don't sleep with anybody else on this tour.

307
00:27:16,219 --> 00:27:17,803
I'm serious.

308
00:27:17,887 --> 00:27:20,639
Yeah, well, how's that fair?
You sleep with James every night.

309
00:27:20,723 --> 00:27:22,849
I don't sleep with him like that.

310
00:27:23,476 --> 00:27:26,269
We don't even kiss
with our mouths open any more.

311
00:27:29,357 --> 00:27:30,774
All right.

312
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:32,692
You're mine.

313
00:27:33,861 --> 00:27:34,945
I'm yours.

314
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:44,871
Good.

315
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:50,752
Okay, everybody, come on back in.
I just had to give Beau a little pep talk.

316
00:27:50,837 --> 00:27:53,505
Okay, everybody,
we got 10 minutes till showtime.

317
00:27:54,674 --> 00:27:56,508
How many of those pills
are you supposed to be taking?

318
00:27:57,677 --> 00:28:00,136
I take whatever's in the square.

319
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:03,515
That's an awfully big square.

320
00:28:04,392 --> 00:28:07,143
I've got some awfully big problems.

321
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:19,030
Somebody get my husband.
I want him to know how lucky he is.

322
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:26,329
- James, Kelly's looking for you.
- I'll be there in a minute.

323
00:28:28,791 --> 00:28:32,252
- The blue dress. She needs to look her age.
- All right. Do you want her hair down?

324
00:28:32,336 --> 00:28:34,296
Hey, how many of those pills
is she supposed to be taking?

325
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:37,465
I want her hair up because Kelly's is down.

326
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:39,009
And I want her to wear those suede Manolos

327
00:28:39,093 --> 00:28:41,511
because I don't like her boots
she's been wearing. Okay? Thanks.

328
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:44,222
Do you like my makeup?

329
00:28:45,016 --> 00:28:47,434
I did it to make my eyes pop.

330
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:50,353
Well, you look beautiful.

331
00:28:50,438 --> 00:28:51,938
James, Kelly took a lot of those pills,
all right,

332
00:28:52,023 --> 00:28:54,649
and I don't know about it.
I thought maybe you'd want to talk to her.

333
00:28:54,734 --> 00:28:56,568
God damn it, Beau.

334
00:28:57,528 --> 00:29:00,363
I know exactly
how many pills Kelly took, all right?

335
00:29:00,448 --> 00:29:02,198
Because I put them in the pill box myself.

336
00:29:02,992 --> 00:29:07,829
Now, the only problem with those pills
is if she's mixing them with alcohol.

337
00:29:08,205 --> 00:29:09,998
That's your job.

338
00:29:11,584 --> 00:29:13,043
Thank you.

339
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:20,050
Oh, my gosh. That's from Emmylou.
That is so nice.

340
00:29:20,718 --> 00:29:22,802
Hey. Did you find him?

341
00:29:22,887 --> 00:29:24,721
Yeah, he's dealing
with a wardrobe emergency.

342
00:29:24,805 --> 00:29:26,097
He said he'll be in when he's done.

343
00:29:27,475 --> 00:29:29,267
He had a wardrobe emergency?

344
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:44,908
It's an exciting night tonight.

345
00:29:44,992 --> 00:29:49,454
Y'all are the first to hear one of the best
country lineups in the state of Texas.

346
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:53,291
And to kick it off, we have a newcomer,
Mr Beau Hutton.

347
00:29:58,214 --> 00:30:02,300
Thank you.

348
00:30:04,178 --> 00:30:07,055
Short and sweet
is what I'm going to make this.

349
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:09,307
It's called Chances Are.

350
00:30:44,135 --> 00:30:45,593
Are you going to open up any more of these

351
00:30:45,678 --> 00:30:47,137
or do you want me to write out a list for you?

352
00:30:47,221 --> 00:30:48,722
Yeah. What's that red one?

353
00:30:50,057 --> 00:30:51,224
It says "H. Roberts."

354
00:30:51,308 --> 00:30:55,061
It's probably that damn cookie place,
heard about the diet I started yesterday.

355
00:30:56,856 --> 00:30:59,482
Man, they get you every damn time.

356
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:09,325
Who gave this to you?

357
00:31:09,577 --> 00:31:12,287
- Did you give this to her?
- It was with all the other packages. I'm sorry.

358
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:15,081
Who told you to give this to her?
Get security.

359
00:31:15,541 --> 00:31:17,000
Right away.

360
00:31:18,878 --> 00:31:20,795
I can't get any air.

361
00:32:04,381 --> 00:32:05,673
Thank you.

362
00:32:05,758 --> 00:32:07,133
How about it, ladies and gentlemen?

363
00:32:07,218 --> 00:32:10,470
How about another round of applause
for Mr Beau Hutton?

364
00:32:10,554 --> 00:32:14,099
We need security
down in dressing room A right away.

365
00:32:16,227 --> 00:32:18,311
- What's going on?
- You can't go in there, Beau.

366
00:32:18,395 --> 00:32:20,730
Nobody's allowed...
Nobody's allowed inside, man.

367
00:32:22,316 --> 00:32:24,609
Hey, Kell. Hey. It's Beau. Open up.

368
00:32:24,693 --> 00:32:27,153
- I need James.
- You're out of your league on this one, boy.

369
00:32:27,238 --> 00:32:28,321
He's with her, isn't he?

370
00:32:28,405 --> 00:32:32,534
Who gives a shit about any of that?
Just open the door. Come on, let's talk.

371
00:32:32,618 --> 00:32:36,955
I do! I love him, you idiot! Get out of here!

372
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:39,374
Get out of here, Beau.
Let me deal with this shit. Go!

373
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:41,709
I'd like y'all to give a nice, big,
warm Houston round of applause

374
00:32:41,794 --> 00:32:44,546
- for the former Miss Dallas herself...
- Baby, you got to come out of there.

375
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:47,841
...the lovely and talented Chiles Stanton.

376
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:08,653
Those people think I killed our baby, James.

377
00:33:10,156 --> 00:33:12,574
Why would anybody think that?

378
00:33:13,784 --> 00:33:17,704
Every time I think you're close to forgetting,
something happens that brings it back up.

379
00:33:17,788 --> 00:33:22,167
Well, I'm not going to forget about Dallas.
It's not something you just forget about.

380
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:27,589
What if we tried again?

381
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:32,302
I bet you I could still get pregnant.

382
00:33:32,386 --> 00:33:34,429
Kelly, listen to me.

383
00:33:36,974 --> 00:33:39,976
You got a lot of people waiting out there.

384
00:33:42,897 --> 00:33:47,025
Let's just get this over with
and then we can go back to the hotel, okay?

385
00:33:47,109 --> 00:33:50,111
All right? Then we'll get some fish and chips.
We'll get in the hot tub.

386
00:33:50,196 --> 00:33:52,572
It'll be just me and you.
You don't want to leave your fans waiting.

387
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:55,783
- So, let's just get out of here...
- It's never been just me and you.

388
00:33:55,868 --> 00:33:58,328
- Let's just get out of here, baby.
- No.

389
00:33:58,412 --> 00:33:59,746
- Get out of the closet, Kelly.
- Don't!

390
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:01,164
- Get out of the closet.
- Don't!

391
00:34:05,127 --> 00:34:07,337
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

392
00:34:07,421 --> 00:34:09,297
James. James.

393
00:34:09,924 --> 00:34:12,550
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

394
00:34:12,635 --> 00:34:14,844
I didn't mean to do that.

395
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:18,181
I'll do whatever you want, okay? Okay?

396
00:34:19,058 --> 00:34:20,516
All right.

397
00:34:22,728 --> 00:34:25,230
Will you remember me like I was?

398
00:34:26,732 --> 00:34:27,941
Yeah.

399
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:30,944
Go on stage, give them hell.

400
00:34:32,488 --> 00:34:34,614
Will you give me a kiss?

401
00:35:05,896 --> 00:35:07,814
Careful of the step.

402
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:14,529
That's good. I got it. I got it.

403
00:35:15,489 --> 00:35:17,824
The first song, Country Strong, right?

404
00:35:17,908 --> 00:35:18,950
Yes.

405
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:21,452
Are you all right?

406
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:42,492
Now, ladies and gentlemen,

407
00:36:42,576 --> 00:36:46,871
the star of tonight's show,
six-time Grammy winner,

408
00:36:46,955 --> 00:36:51,584
the belle of Bristol,
our very own Kelly Canter.

409
00:37:13,107 --> 00:37:16,150
Hold on one second. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

410
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:22,365
Sorry. I just...

411
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:26,994
Thank you so much.

412
00:37:33,335 --> 00:37:37,588
You just cannot understand
what this means to me. Thank you.

413
00:37:38,674 --> 00:37:40,299
We love you!

414
00:37:51,562 --> 00:37:55,648
I was just in my dressing room,

415
00:37:55,732 --> 00:37:57,358
and I was looking out the window,

416
00:37:57,443 --> 00:38:01,195
and I was looking up at the big, bright sky,

417
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,031
and there are so many stars.

418
00:38:04,116 --> 00:38:05,700
And I thought,

419
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:12,206
"Man, it looks like they would take
such good care of you."

420
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,294
Do you know what I mean?

421
00:38:18,046 --> 00:38:20,047
Come on, baby, come on. Don't do this.

422
00:38:20,132 --> 00:38:24,051
I never lived on a star,
but it sure looks like fun.

423
00:38:32,102 --> 00:38:34,770
Hey, what did y'all think of Beau?

424
00:38:36,482 --> 00:38:38,399
Wasn't he great?

425
00:38:38,484 --> 00:38:40,985
Let's go. Come on, come on, play!

426
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:46,491
Come on, baby, come on. Sing!

427
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:50,328
Oh, y'all want me to sing?

428
00:38:58,212 --> 00:39:00,546
I am going to sing, okay?

429
00:39:01,131 --> 00:39:02,632
I just...

430
00:39:03,842 --> 00:39:07,595
I just feel like I need to sit down.
Would that be okay?

431
00:39:08,972 --> 00:39:13,267
Can I just sit down and just rest?
And I am going to sing.

432
00:39:16,104 --> 00:39:18,064
- Love you!
- All right, Kelly!

433
00:39:21,318 --> 00:39:24,570
I'm going to sing. Let's sing A Fighter, okay?

434
00:40:50,449 --> 00:40:51,657
Sing.

435
00:40:52,618 --> 00:40:54,118
Sing, Kelly.

436
00:40:54,494 --> 00:40:55,786
Sing, baby.

437
00:41:29,696 --> 00:41:32,740
We're never going to make it to Dallas!
The whole show's going to get cancelled!

438
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:35,576
- Would you just relax?
- Hey, where the hell were you?

439
00:41:35,661 --> 00:41:38,412
Where the hell were you when she had
a bottle of vodka in her dressing room?

440
00:41:38,497 --> 00:41:40,581
- I was on stage!
- You were on stage?

441
00:41:40,666 --> 00:41:42,458
Jesus Christ, don't you have
any tricks up your sleeve?

442
00:41:42,542 --> 00:41:46,295
Yeah, don't take somebody out of rehab
before the rehab!

443
00:41:46,672 --> 00:41:48,589
Who the hell do you think you are, kid?

444
00:42:04,981 --> 00:42:06,649
Will you sign this?

445
00:42:09,277 --> 00:42:13,197
People are ready to forgive you, but you
have to give them something they want.

446
00:42:13,281 --> 00:42:15,074
I've scheduled
an emergency press conference

447
00:42:15,158 --> 00:42:18,661
and a Make A Wish appearance in Austin.
The kid's name is...

448
00:42:18,745 --> 00:42:21,539
- Travis.
- Travis. And he has...

449
00:42:21,623 --> 00:42:23,374
- Leukaemia.
- Leukaemia.

450
00:42:24,126 --> 00:42:26,836
Let's go, people.
It's time to do some clean-up here.

451
00:42:30,173 --> 00:42:31,257
Thanks, JJ.

452
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:34,844
We'll make it up to you next week.

453
00:42:34,928 --> 00:42:36,429
She better put on a real pretty face.

454
00:42:37,514 --> 00:42:41,642
Fool me once, shame on you.
Fool me twice, shame on me.

455
00:42:43,562 --> 00:42:45,521
Shit. Come on, man.

456
00:42:45,814 --> 00:42:48,858
You know we're all fools in this business.

457
00:43:03,498 --> 00:43:04,915
What are you looking at?

458
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:10,087
No one's ever going to buy food poisoning.
She's a total basket case.

459
00:43:10,756 --> 00:43:14,091
Why don't you be quiet
and tell me what you're looking at?

460
00:43:15,802 --> 00:43:16,927
Don't.

461
00:43:21,641 --> 00:43:25,352
"When did General MacArthur
return to the Philippines?"

462
00:43:26,313 --> 00:43:27,980
1946.

463
00:43:29,357 --> 00:43:31,275
"What does 'amorous' mean?"

464
00:43:32,027 --> 00:43:34,528
Having a propensity for falling in love.

465
00:43:35,197 --> 00:43:37,031
What the hell are these things?

466
00:43:37,115 --> 00:43:39,533
Well, as a woman in this industry,

467
00:43:39,618 --> 00:43:42,620
people have a habit of thinking
I'm some kind of ignoramus.

468
00:43:43,789 --> 00:43:47,792
And my pageant training doesn't exactly
help things, so I have to overcompensate.

469
00:43:48,418 --> 00:43:51,253
You're not the only one who thinks
I'm just some dumb beauty queen.

470
00:43:51,546 --> 00:43:53,964
I'd never call you a dumb beauty queen.

471
00:43:55,467 --> 00:43:56,592
Give me those.

472
00:43:56,718 --> 00:44:00,596
I'm serious.
Anybody that says "ignoramus" so casually,

473
00:44:01,723 --> 00:44:04,558
that's not dumb at all.

474
00:44:07,562 --> 00:44:09,730
Why don't y'all just sleep together?

475
00:44:09,815 --> 00:44:12,775
Get it over with. Jesus. Really.

476
00:44:21,117 --> 00:44:22,159
I feel great.

477
00:44:22,661 --> 00:44:24,787
I feel better than I have in a long time,

478
00:44:25,413 --> 00:44:28,415
aside from the food poisoning incident.

479
00:44:29,501 --> 00:44:33,921
Note to self: never trust a sushi bar
that's open 24 hours a day.

480
00:44:35,173 --> 00:44:37,466
But all that's behind me now.

481
00:44:37,592 --> 00:44:41,971
And I just want to say, I'm really looking
forward to playing for my fans here in Austin.

482
00:44:42,097 --> 00:44:43,264
What about Dallas?

483
00:44:44,516 --> 00:44:45,558
Dallas?

484
00:44:45,642 --> 00:44:48,686
Yeah, your last date
will be broadcast in Dallas, correct?

485
00:44:51,273 --> 00:44:52,439
Yes.

486
00:44:53,775 --> 00:44:57,611
We all know that Dallas and I have a history,

487
00:44:57,696 --> 00:45:00,114
and it's not such a good one.

488
00:45:00,824 --> 00:45:03,617
So I'm really looking forward
to changing that.

489
00:45:04,202 --> 00:45:05,619
Thank you.

490
00:45:05,704 --> 00:45:06,954
Kelly!

491
00:45:08,290 --> 00:45:09,623
Kelly! Kelly!

492
00:45:09,833 --> 00:45:10,958
Is this on?

493
00:45:13,169 --> 00:45:15,337
I guess so. I'm sorry.

494
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:19,300
My parents are school teachers.
I'm not used to running in such fancy circles.

495
00:45:19,384 --> 00:45:20,467
- Chiles!
- Chiles!

496
00:45:20,677 --> 00:45:22,511
- Yes?
- Chiles, who is your idol?

497
00:45:23,847 --> 00:45:27,808
I'm on tour with her right now.
And Jesus Christ, of course.

498
00:45:28,310 --> 00:45:30,477
Kelly Canter and Jesus Christ.

499
00:45:31,146 --> 00:45:32,897
You and Jesus Christ.
Who would have thought?

500
00:45:34,858 --> 00:45:37,401
- They love her.
- Yeah, I guess.

501
00:45:39,654 --> 00:45:41,822
What do you think of her?

502
00:45:42,198 --> 00:45:43,657
I don't.

503
00:45:46,536 --> 00:45:49,204
You're not a very good liar, Beau.

504
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:52,833
Hey, are we still going to hang out today?

505
00:45:54,044 --> 00:45:55,753
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

506
00:45:55,837 --> 00:45:57,338
So, what do you suppose we do?

507
00:45:57,422 --> 00:46:01,050
Steal a car, do some skinny-dipping,
shave our heads?

508
00:46:04,012 --> 00:46:07,640
Hey, come on.
Let's get out of here and have some fun.

509
00:46:07,724 --> 00:46:09,183
- Come on.
- Okay.

510
00:46:12,604 --> 00:46:13,896
Well, what do you think?

511
00:46:14,022 --> 00:46:17,399
I think I'm Kelly Canter
and I'm breaking the law!

512
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:20,361
Give me more! Yeah! Come on!

513
00:46:20,570 --> 00:46:21,695
Get it out there! Give me more!

514
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:25,240
Yeah! I got six Grammys
and seven platinum records!

515
00:46:26,701 --> 00:46:28,410
And everybody knows who I am!

516
00:46:29,955 --> 00:46:32,164
And? Come on, what else?

517
00:46:32,248 --> 00:46:36,418
And I have the best damn marriage
in the world of country music!

518
00:47:11,496 --> 00:47:13,580
Yeah, she's good, James.

519
00:47:13,957 --> 00:47:17,710
Let's talk about the Freedom Tour.
She might be a good addition.

520
00:47:17,794 --> 00:47:18,961
You better hurry.

521
00:47:19,087 --> 00:47:20,587
- How about this week?
- All right.

522
00:47:21,339 --> 00:47:25,843
Look, I was sorry to hear about Kelly.
We were all praying for her.

523
00:47:25,927 --> 00:47:30,347
Thank you, Bob, but she's doing just fine.
She's looking forward to the next show.

524
00:47:30,432 --> 00:47:33,350
- She also loves the tracks you sent over.
- Oh, yeah?

525
00:47:33,435 --> 00:47:37,062
Yeah. Especially Coming Home.
She thinks that could be her next single.

526
00:47:37,147 --> 00:47:39,982
She'd sing the hell out of it, Bob.

527
00:47:40,108 --> 00:47:43,777
The little girl right there is the one
to sing that song. I'll talk to you later.

528
00:47:55,707 --> 00:47:56,999
What?

529
00:47:59,502 --> 00:48:01,712
Maybe we should stop this.

530
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:07,801
You're married, Kelly, you know?

531
00:48:08,303 --> 00:48:10,804
Well, I've always been married.

532
00:48:13,224 --> 00:48:15,392
Yeah, but just after today, I've been thinking

533
00:48:15,477 --> 00:48:19,480
that maybe I'm just not the best thing
for you in your life.

534
00:48:23,193 --> 00:48:25,152
I want to be, but...

535
00:48:28,364 --> 00:48:29,823
I'm just

536
00:48:30,658 --> 00:48:33,202
trying to do what's best for you.

537
00:48:34,662 --> 00:48:36,163
Since when?

538
00:48:44,839 --> 00:48:47,341
I think the world of you, Beau.

539
00:48:48,843 --> 00:48:53,514
But sometimes you don't have
the faintest idea of how to talk to women.

540
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:11,406
Hey.

541
00:49:11,741 --> 00:49:14,743
- Do you want to hang out?
- No, not really.

542
00:49:15,954 --> 00:49:17,037
All right.

543
00:49:18,873 --> 00:49:22,209
I just wanted to show you my lyrics.
That's all.

544
00:49:30,468 --> 00:49:31,927
Where have you been?

545
00:49:33,054 --> 00:49:34,555
I was with Beau.

546
00:49:35,056 --> 00:49:36,890
Why do you have a towel on?

547
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:42,896
We were out and I got so dirty
I needed to take a shower.

548
00:49:44,566 --> 00:49:46,775
Well, that sounds like fun.

549
00:49:49,154 --> 00:49:50,445
It was.

550
00:49:57,620 --> 00:50:00,581
- Can I help you do that?
- Nope, I got it.

551
00:50:14,512 --> 00:50:17,181
Are you going to let me in or what?

552
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:24,104
Do you write all your own lyrics?

553
00:50:25,148 --> 00:50:27,357
What is this, Twenty Questions?

554
00:50:27,859 --> 00:50:29,776
How come you haven't got the chorus
wrote down yet?

555
00:50:29,986 --> 00:50:32,112
Because I haven't come up with it yet.

556
00:50:32,488 --> 00:50:34,656
I could write it for you.

557
00:50:35,533 --> 00:50:36,950
This ain't Mad Libs, Chiles.

558
00:50:37,035 --> 00:50:39,953
You can't just fill in a blank
with a noun America loves.

559
00:50:41,539 --> 00:50:44,833
Well, I could write good lyrics if I wanted to.

560
00:50:45,168 --> 00:50:49,504
Maybe I just haven't been inspired
by anyone yet. You ever think about that?

561
00:50:50,173 --> 00:50:53,050
I don't need to be singing
about my Achy Breaky Heart.

562
00:50:53,551 --> 00:50:56,345
Give In To Me? That's what it's called?

563
00:50:58,848 --> 00:51:02,226
- I like that title.
- Good. Then don't mess it up.

564
00:51:02,518 --> 00:51:06,063
Oh, my God! The Miss America Pageant's on.

565
00:51:06,481 --> 00:51:09,024
I'm just dying for Miss Oklahoma to win.

566
00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:12,194
She's got the best figure,
and she does the prettiest ribbon routine.

567
00:51:12,987 --> 00:51:14,529
I think I need a drink.

568
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:22,246
- Do you want one?
- Just a tiny one.

569
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:29,169
How would I change the world
if I won this crown?

570
00:51:30,922 --> 00:51:35,259
I would start by putting country music
on all US outbound flights.

571
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:40,180
Then I'd change the national anthem
to Merle Haggard's Mama Tried.

572
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:44,685
This is how you win a beauty pageant.

573
00:51:45,186 --> 00:51:46,770
Oh, let's see.

574
00:51:49,232 --> 00:51:52,609
"Thank you, ladies and gentlemen,
distinguished judges."

575
00:51:52,694 --> 00:51:54,611
That's such bullshit.

576
00:51:55,697 --> 00:51:58,365
And then I give them one of my seven smiles.

577
00:51:58,449 --> 00:52:01,702
- Yeah, let's see them.
- Well, I got swimsuit.

578
00:52:05,206 --> 00:52:07,082
And then interview.

579
00:52:08,209 --> 00:52:09,876
I like that one.

580
00:52:09,961 --> 00:52:11,461
I got my formal wear.

581
00:52:13,756 --> 00:52:16,091
Which one's your drunk-off-my-ass smile?

582
00:52:16,384 --> 00:52:18,302
I think you're drunk.

583
00:52:19,137 --> 00:52:21,722
You know, I think we should have
a swimsuit competition.

584
00:52:22,473 --> 00:52:24,558
I don't have a swimsuit.

585
00:52:24,642 --> 00:52:27,519
Well, you're wearing a bra and panties,
aren't you?

586
00:52:27,603 --> 00:52:28,687
Yeah.

587
00:52:28,771 --> 00:52:30,731
Yeah, it's the same thing.

588
00:52:31,607 --> 00:52:34,901
Yeah, I'm doing it. Here we go.
You versus me.

589
00:52:36,571 --> 00:52:38,488
Beau, what are you doing?

590
00:52:38,573 --> 00:52:41,491
Don't be a chickenshit about this, Chiles.

591
00:52:41,576 --> 00:52:44,745
I've seen plenty of ladies
in their swimsuits before.

592
00:52:44,829 --> 00:52:47,748
I'll get into mine just so we're even.

593
00:52:49,917 --> 00:52:51,418
Your turn.

594
00:52:53,796 --> 00:52:55,255
All right.

595
00:52:58,468 --> 00:52:59,801
But no pictures.

596
00:53:01,262 --> 00:53:03,638
I may go on to be Miss America one day.

597
00:53:16,986 --> 00:53:19,112
So, what do we do now?

598
00:53:19,781 --> 00:53:22,282
Build a sandcastle or something?

599
00:53:28,456 --> 00:53:30,999
Oh, my God. That must be James.

600
00:53:31,459 --> 00:53:33,377
- What the hell's he doing here?
- Put your pants on.

601
00:53:33,461 --> 00:53:35,545
Well, it's not like you have
to answer it or anything.

602
00:53:35,630 --> 00:53:37,130
You know I do.

603
00:53:37,215 --> 00:53:39,299
Put your pants on. Hurry.

604
00:53:44,972 --> 00:53:46,640
- Hi, James.
- Hey.

605
00:53:47,809 --> 00:53:50,394
I was just showing Beau my pageant walk.

606
00:53:50,478 --> 00:53:52,979
And he was leaving.
Right, Beau? You were just leaving?

607
00:53:53,064 --> 00:53:56,191
- Yeah.
- Well, that's something I'd like to see.

608
00:53:58,694 --> 00:54:00,570
Is that guyliner?

609
00:54:02,156 --> 00:54:04,199
That's real cute, Beau.

610
00:54:09,497 --> 00:54:11,498
The Statesman's calling you
the next Carrie Underwood.

611
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:13,417
- Really?
- Yes.

612
00:54:13,501 --> 00:54:16,420
You're on their
"Top Ten Country Artists to Watch" list.

613
00:54:16,504 --> 00:54:18,630
- Was Beau on the list?
- Yes.

614
00:54:18,714 --> 00:54:21,716
"The next Townes Van Zandt." Who's that?

615
00:54:22,677 --> 00:54:25,262
- He was a singer-songwriter.
- Was he famous?

616
00:54:26,347 --> 00:54:30,434
In some circles, but not nearly as famous
as Carrie Underwood.

617
00:54:36,232 --> 00:54:39,776
How did you know?
How did you know I had it in me?

618
00:54:39,861 --> 00:54:43,530
I just took one look at you, darling. I mean,
you might as well be holding up a stop sign.

619
00:54:43,614 --> 00:54:45,866
Most people just pass right through.

620
00:54:47,201 --> 00:54:51,538
Yeah, well, they'll regret it.
I promise you that.

621
00:54:59,213 --> 00:55:01,298
Well, you just got to figure out
another pickup line.

622
00:55:01,382 --> 00:55:02,424
Hi, Beau.

623
00:55:04,552 --> 00:55:08,221
- Did you have a good time last night?
- Yeah. Sure.

624
00:55:08,931 --> 00:55:10,765
Yeah, that's good.

625
00:55:12,477 --> 00:55:15,812
I finished your lyrics for you. There they are.

626
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:18,231
God, how did you ever find the time?

627
00:55:19,233 --> 00:55:20,942
You be quiet, Beau Hutton.

628
00:55:23,738 --> 00:55:26,281
Chiles, me and the guys here,
we were talking about that year

629
00:55:26,407 --> 00:55:29,201
MacArthur returned back to the Philippines.

630
00:55:29,285 --> 00:55:32,412
Just none of us could think of
when that was. When was that?

631
00:55:34,415 --> 00:55:36,458
Are you making fun of me, Beau?

632
00:55:37,752 --> 00:55:41,087
Well, I don't know.
Let me check my flash card.

633
00:55:44,926 --> 00:55:46,301
Yes, I am.

634
00:55:50,264 --> 00:55:51,515
You're an asshole, man.

635
00:56:21,170 --> 00:56:23,630
What are you doing here?

636
00:56:23,714 --> 00:56:25,674
- You're not supposed to be here.
- Yeah, well,

637
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:28,677
I just looked for the biggest shit-hole bar
in town and there you were, Beau.

638
00:56:28,803 --> 00:56:31,346
You're not that hard to figure out.

639
00:56:33,641 --> 00:56:36,685
I thought you didn't want anything else
to do with me.

640
00:56:36,811 --> 00:56:38,853
I'm waving a white flag.

641
00:56:39,397 --> 00:56:43,358
I got a surprise for you.
Come on, Winnie's waiting for us out front.

642
00:56:43,484 --> 00:56:44,943
Come on!

643
00:56:45,027 --> 00:56:46,111
Seriously?

644
00:56:46,195 --> 00:56:48,613
Yeah. You gotta to learn your way around
a recording studio.

645
00:56:48,698 --> 00:56:53,034
After Dallas, your fans
are going to want to buy something.

646
00:57:04,171 --> 00:57:05,589
What's going on?

647
00:57:07,883 --> 00:57:09,676
What are you doing here, Kelly?

648
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,261
That's my song.

649
00:57:11,345 --> 00:57:14,514
I know you liked the song, baby,
but Bob sent some other songs over

650
00:57:14,599 --> 00:57:17,601
that were much better, much more
appropriate for you. I liked them a lot.

651
00:57:18,519 --> 00:57:20,812
This song, it was too, I don't know what.

652
00:57:20,896 --> 00:57:23,023
- It was just too...
- Too what?

653
00:57:23,107 --> 00:57:25,525
Too good? Too young? What?

654
00:57:26,193 --> 00:57:27,569
It wasn't right for you.

655
00:57:29,113 --> 00:57:30,196
I get it.

656
00:57:30,698 --> 00:57:33,491
You can't expect to be the toast of the town
after the way you've acted.

657
00:57:33,576 --> 00:57:37,787
Believe me, you've made it perfectly clear
that I'm not the toast of anyone's town.

658
00:57:38,539 --> 00:57:40,457
- Kelly, listen.
- Get off of me!

659
00:58:05,650 --> 00:58:06,733
Hey.

660
00:58:07,443 --> 00:58:09,903
Leave me alone, James.

661
00:58:10,655 --> 00:58:13,740
Kell, I got somebody out here
who wants to see you, okay?

662
00:58:14,450 --> 00:58:15,909
Who?

663
00:58:15,993 --> 00:58:17,577
Look here.

664
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:27,170
She's been asking for you all day.

665
00:58:28,756 --> 00:58:30,298
Loretta Lynn.

666
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:33,468
I'm busy, you know, today, and...

667
00:58:36,931 --> 00:58:41,142
I thought you could take her back
to the hotel with you, take care of her.

668
00:58:41,268 --> 00:58:44,604
You're just trying to make me feel better.

669
00:58:44,689 --> 00:58:49,109
I got to run over to Stanley's this afternoon
and I can't take her with me.

670
00:58:49,193 --> 00:58:51,194
They won't allow it.

671
00:58:51,278 --> 00:58:53,113
You know? So...

672
00:58:55,157 --> 00:58:57,701
It would help.

673
00:59:09,046 --> 00:59:11,506
Oh, my God, James.

674
00:59:13,968 --> 00:59:17,804
- She's so tiny.
- Yeah, she is, isn't she?

675
00:59:20,141 --> 00:59:22,225
She gets hungry really fast.

676
00:59:23,227 --> 00:59:25,645
So, you should probably come on out.

677
00:59:26,981 --> 00:59:28,648
Okay.

678
00:59:31,986 --> 00:59:33,361
All right.

679
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:02,348
You must not think I'm much of a man.

680
01:00:03,434 --> 01:00:05,018
I never said that.

681
01:00:07,938 --> 01:00:10,607
I don't always dance for her, you know?

682
01:00:11,859 --> 01:00:13,276
I know.

683
01:00:15,237 --> 01:00:17,572
She used to be tough as nails.

684
01:00:20,951 --> 01:00:22,869
What happened to her?

685
01:00:25,039 --> 01:00:26,539
I don't know.

686
01:00:28,209 --> 01:00:30,210
She had a fire in her.

687
01:00:32,129 --> 01:00:35,423
The only place she wanted to be
was on stage.

688
01:00:35,549 --> 01:00:36,966
That was it.

689
01:00:41,889 --> 01:00:45,058
I don't know when she got
so goddamn fragile.

690
01:00:46,477 --> 01:00:48,645
Maybe she's done.

691
01:00:48,729 --> 01:00:51,731
No. No, I can't let her go out like this.

692
01:00:54,068 --> 01:00:56,820
Then, let's just stop her right now.

693
01:00:57,947 --> 01:00:59,113
Before it gets any worse.

694
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:00,406
- No. No.
- Just turn the bus around

695
01:01:00,491 --> 01:01:01,574
and put her back in rehab.

696
01:01:01,659 --> 01:01:04,619
It might get better. She can get stronger.

697
01:01:04,745 --> 01:01:07,163
You and I both know
she's not getting any better.

698
01:01:07,248 --> 01:01:09,165
You're just talking like her sponsor.

699
01:01:12,002 --> 01:01:14,796
You and I both know
I was never her sponsor.

700
01:01:41,949 --> 01:01:44,951
- Where's Kell?
- She told me she was going to pick you up.

701
01:02:08,684 --> 01:02:10,310
Shake it, girl!

702
01:02:12,396 --> 01:02:14,981
Kelly, come on. Come on, time to go.

703
01:02:15,232 --> 01:02:17,817
- Beau! Beau!
- Get down.

704
01:02:19,153 --> 01:02:21,654
Hey! Just give her a break, guys.

705
01:02:21,739 --> 01:02:23,156
- We're just having a good time with her.
- Stop it!

706
01:02:24,825 --> 01:02:25,909
Just listen to me.

707
01:02:25,993 --> 01:02:28,453
- How dare you do that to me?
- I don't give a shit!

708
01:02:28,537 --> 01:02:32,415
Can you get down here now, Chiles?
It's Miss Kitty's on 38th 1/2.

709
01:02:32,499 --> 01:02:35,209
How dare you? Those people are my friends!

710
01:02:35,336 --> 01:02:37,003
- Because I need your help.
- Come in here

711
01:02:37,087 --> 01:02:38,338
- and pull me out of a bar.
- I don't care.

712
01:02:38,422 --> 01:02:40,590
- Just take a cab and pull around back.
- Who do you think you are?

713
01:03:14,708 --> 01:03:17,377
You're just somebody's daughter,
aren't you?

714
01:03:18,963 --> 01:03:21,631
Yes, I guess I am.

715
01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:25,385
Whose daughter are you?

716
01:03:26,804 --> 01:03:30,640
Her name is Sandy. I'm Sandy's daughter.

717
01:03:31,809 --> 01:03:35,436
She must have done a real number on you.

718
01:03:35,562 --> 01:03:37,563
Yes, ma'am, she did.

719
01:03:37,940 --> 01:03:39,774
Don't call me "ma'am."

720
01:03:40,651 --> 01:03:41,901
Sorry.

721
01:03:45,572 --> 01:03:47,991
I always wanted a daughter.

722
01:03:48,659 --> 01:03:50,326
You did?

723
01:03:52,579 --> 01:03:54,414
I will, one day.

724
01:03:57,584 --> 01:04:01,754
I'm going to have a daughter
and treat her just like fine china.

725
01:04:03,507 --> 01:04:06,009
I'll tell her how smart she is.

726
01:04:09,430 --> 01:04:12,765
And I'm going to let her drive
whenever she wants.

727
01:04:15,185 --> 01:04:18,521
And I'll let her get her ears pierced.

728
01:04:18,605 --> 01:04:19,772
I will.

729
01:04:22,276 --> 01:04:24,777
I got my ears pierced when I was six.

730
01:04:25,821 --> 01:04:29,157
I had my eye on
these beautiful diamond stars.

731
01:04:30,492 --> 01:04:34,787
I told myself they were diamonds,
but I'm pretty sure they were just CZs.

732
01:04:36,874 --> 01:04:39,709
My mom said I had to get
the starting-out earrings

733
01:04:39,793 --> 01:04:43,212
and those were just boring old gold balls.

734
01:04:43,297 --> 01:04:45,965
You know, just the real plain ones.

735
01:04:47,885 --> 01:04:51,471
She said I could change them out
if I was responsible enough to clean them,

736
01:04:51,555 --> 01:04:53,389
but she never let me.

737
01:04:54,475 --> 01:04:59,145
- Well, they sound real pretty.
- Yeah, they were real pretty.

738
01:05:02,191 --> 01:05:06,360
I think you can have one hell of a career
if you want one.

739
01:05:06,487 --> 01:05:07,820
I want one.

740
01:05:09,656 --> 01:05:11,824
I know you do.

741
01:05:13,994 --> 01:05:16,829
Be nice to Beau, okay?

742
01:05:20,667 --> 01:05:22,919
He thinks he's so tough.

743
01:05:24,046 --> 01:05:27,548
But I ain't ever had a man
be so gentle with me.

744
01:05:30,594 --> 01:05:32,762
He's one of the good ones.

745
01:05:34,431 --> 01:05:36,891
He's one of the only good ones.

746
01:05:38,393 --> 01:05:40,686
Does this mean we're friends?

747
01:05:46,401 --> 01:05:48,194
No, sweetheart.

748
01:05:51,907 --> 01:05:54,033
It don't mean a thing.

749
01:06:08,966 --> 01:06:12,385
Kelly! Kelly! Kelly!

750
01:06:16,598 --> 01:06:19,225
Where in the hell have y'all been?

751
01:06:23,730 --> 01:06:24,897
Hey! Hey!

752
01:06:24,982 --> 01:06:27,608
Get a hold of yourself! Come on!
Get it together!

753
01:06:27,734 --> 01:06:29,735
Let her alone, James. She's sick.

754
01:06:37,494 --> 01:06:39,162
JJ, she's fine.

755
01:06:39,246 --> 01:06:41,873
- She's a little under the weather.
- She's done. We're done.

756
01:06:41,957 --> 01:06:44,625
The sponsor's been pulled. The show is over.

757
01:06:44,751 --> 01:06:46,919
JJ, look. You can fix this.

758
01:06:47,004 --> 01:06:48,921
You know them well. They trust you.

759
01:06:49,006 --> 01:06:51,090
- We go back a long way.
- I just lost a quarter of a million

760
01:06:51,175 --> 01:06:54,218
in return tickets.
I'm probably not the person you want to ask.

761
01:06:54,303 --> 01:06:56,012
JJ, come on. It's not all about money!

762
01:06:56,096 --> 01:06:59,307
I cannot believe we fell for this shit again.

763
01:06:59,433 --> 01:07:02,101
- We got to have Dallas.
- She's done.

764
01:07:14,323 --> 01:07:16,365
How y'all doing tonight?

765
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:20,953
Thank you very much for waiting.

766
01:07:21,038 --> 01:07:23,956
I have a special surprise for you.

767
01:07:24,041 --> 01:07:26,000
It's a new song,

768
01:07:26,126 --> 01:07:29,462
and I'm going to need my friend,
Chiles Stanton,

769
01:07:29,546 --> 01:07:31,547
to come out and sing this with me.

770
01:07:31,632 --> 01:07:32,798
No.

771
01:07:33,634 --> 01:07:36,010
She's a very talented songwriter
and this is her song.

772
01:07:36,136 --> 01:07:38,304
Will you please welcome to the stage,
Miss Chiles Stanton.

773
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:42,016
Come on.

774
01:07:44,311 --> 01:07:46,145
What the hell are you doing?

775
01:07:46,521 --> 01:07:48,439
Hi, everybody.

776
01:07:48,523 --> 01:07:53,319
This is our first time singing it,
so please be kind to us.

777
01:08:32,693 --> 01:08:34,610
I have sources that say alcohol was involved.

778
01:08:34,695 --> 01:08:36,195
I don't know anything about that.

779
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:39,198
Thousands of people paid their hard-earned
money to see Kelly perform tonight,

780
01:08:39,283 --> 01:08:41,534
and they're walking away disappointed.
What do you say to that?

781
01:08:41,618 --> 01:08:43,703
I'd say I expect a little more loyalty.

782
01:08:55,257 --> 01:08:56,382
Kelly?

783
01:08:58,927 --> 01:09:01,137
- Get out of here, Beau.
- Get the hell out, kid!

784
01:09:01,221 --> 01:09:02,805
What the hell did you say?

785
01:09:02,889 --> 01:09:05,141
- She's not your wife!
- Yeah, she ain't yours, either!

786
01:09:05,767 --> 01:09:08,978
Get the hell out of here,
you goddamn asshole!

787
01:09:10,814 --> 01:09:13,566
- Do you feel tough now?
- Get dressed, Kelly.

788
01:09:14,443 --> 01:09:16,694
You're the only one
that's good enough for me, is that it?

789
01:09:16,778 --> 01:09:19,071
No, but I'm a hell of a lot better
than that asshole.

790
01:09:19,990 --> 01:09:21,991
You're no better than him at all.

791
01:09:22,075 --> 01:09:24,535
Do you think he gives a shit about you?

792
01:09:24,619 --> 01:09:27,163
Do you think you give a shit about me?

793
01:09:27,247 --> 01:09:29,582
Knocking on my door every goddamn day!

794
01:09:29,666 --> 01:09:32,501
If you gave a shit about me, you would
have left me alone in the first place!

795
01:09:32,586 --> 01:09:34,670
I'm here for you
and you're just too dumb to realise it.

796
01:09:35,255 --> 01:09:37,423
- You just want what you can get.
- Give me the bottle, Kelly.

797
01:09:37,507 --> 01:09:38,632
- Give it to me!
- No more.

798
01:09:38,759 --> 01:09:40,092
- Give it to me!
- Give it!

799
01:09:43,597 --> 01:09:45,681
Why did you do that?

800
01:09:59,780 --> 01:10:01,739
I'm tired.

801
01:10:01,823 --> 01:10:04,158
Come on, let's get you to bed.

802
01:10:28,850 --> 01:10:30,476
I'm sorry.

803
01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:35,147
PBR.

804
01:11:22,362 --> 01:11:25,739
Dallas is going to be cancelled, isn't it?
She's crazy.

805
01:11:25,866 --> 01:11:29,243
She's not crazy.
She's the only honest one here.

806
01:11:33,039 --> 01:11:34,874
Why are you here, Chiles?

807
01:11:37,210 --> 01:11:39,378
- I don't know.
- I'm tired.

808
01:11:39,754 --> 01:11:42,256
- Wait!
- Wait, what?

809
01:11:42,799 --> 01:11:44,800
Do you want to come in?

810
01:11:45,135 --> 01:11:46,260
Stop it.

811
01:11:46,386 --> 01:11:48,762
- Fine.
- Wait! Don't...

812
01:11:51,391 --> 01:11:53,809
Don't make me say it.

813
01:11:53,894 --> 01:11:55,311
Say what?

814
01:11:56,980 --> 01:11:59,064
You're being very rude right now.

815
01:11:59,733 --> 01:12:01,400
Tell me what you want.

816
01:12:06,907 --> 01:12:08,240
Nothing.

817
01:13:45,922 --> 01:13:47,506
Where are you going?

818
01:13:48,008 --> 01:13:51,385
They found Loretta Lynn's box at the bar.

819
01:13:51,511 --> 01:13:53,846
They were going to throw her out
with the garbage.

820
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:57,891
I'm going to give her to
somebody who can take care of her.

821
01:13:59,561 --> 01:14:03,647
I thought we had that Make A Wish thing
today at noon.

822
01:14:03,732 --> 01:14:06,692
It doesn't matter any more.
You don't have to do it.

823
01:14:08,695 --> 01:14:12,364
Hey, I talked to JJ.
He's going to let us have Dallas.

824
01:14:12,449 --> 01:14:14,366
I can't imagine why.

825
01:14:21,374 --> 01:14:24,376
What if I told you I was never Miss Dallas?

826
01:14:26,254 --> 01:14:29,256
I'd probably like you even more. Were you?

827
01:14:34,387 --> 01:14:35,721
I almost was.

828
01:14:36,723 --> 01:14:38,390
What happened?

829
01:14:41,227 --> 01:14:42,561
I choked.

830
01:14:44,064 --> 01:14:45,606
Like always.

831
01:14:50,570 --> 01:14:54,406
They asked me what my stance
on global warming was,

832
01:14:54,491 --> 01:14:58,243
and all I could think of was a planet
in a big, old sweater

833
01:14:58,328 --> 01:15:00,496
my grandma used to make me.

834
01:15:02,749 --> 01:15:05,834
I'm sure that would have kept
the whole world nice and warm.

835
01:15:12,425 --> 01:15:13,926
Do you still like me?

836
01:15:15,345 --> 01:15:17,096
I still like you.

837
01:15:18,098 --> 01:15:21,600
- I'm serious, Beau.
- I still like you.

838
01:15:23,436 --> 01:15:25,437
But I'm not what I seem.

839
01:15:26,439 --> 01:15:29,108
Well, maybe that's what I like about you.

840
01:15:30,151 --> 01:15:32,611
- Did you ever think of that?
- No.

841
01:15:35,782 --> 01:15:41,036
Maybe that's what makes you different
from all those other pretty pennies out there.

842
01:15:47,961 --> 01:15:51,130
It's just going to be a few minutes
of your time, okay, Mrs Canter?

843
01:15:51,214 --> 01:15:53,841
Just take a couple of photos with the boy
and we'll have you on your way.

844
01:15:53,967 --> 01:15:56,301
- Okay.
- It's right down here.

845
01:15:56,386 --> 01:15:59,638
- Do you need a coffee?
- No, I'm fine. Thank you.

846
01:16:01,307 --> 01:16:02,474
Hi.

847
01:16:03,685 --> 01:16:07,479
Thank you so much for coming.
It just means the world to us.

848
01:16:07,564 --> 01:16:11,233
It's my pleasure. Thank you. Which one is...

849
01:16:11,317 --> 01:16:13,318
- Is that Travis there?
- He's right over there.

850
01:16:13,403 --> 01:16:14,653
Okay.

851
01:16:20,994 --> 01:16:22,244
- Hi.
- Hi.

852
01:16:22,328 --> 01:16:23,954
- Are you Travis?
- Yes.

853
01:16:24,038 --> 01:16:25,748
- Do you mind if I sit down?
- No.

854
01:16:25,832 --> 01:16:27,666
Okay.

855
01:16:29,002 --> 01:16:31,086
- Hi.
- Hi.

856
01:16:31,171 --> 01:16:33,338
- Is this your class?
- Yes.

857
01:16:34,257 --> 01:16:36,175
- Do you have any fun in here?
- Yes.

858
01:16:36,259 --> 01:16:37,551
You do?

859
01:16:38,344 --> 01:16:42,055
- That's good. Thanks for inviting me.
- You're welcome.

860
01:16:42,432 --> 01:16:44,308
Tell her how much
you love her music, Travis.

861
01:16:44,392 --> 01:16:45,976
Are you going to play a song for me?

862
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:50,063
What? Am I going to play a song for you?

863
01:16:51,524 --> 01:16:54,359
- No, you don't have to.
- Yes, I am.

864
01:16:54,444 --> 01:16:57,029
I am. That's why I brought my guys.

865
01:16:58,198 --> 01:17:00,032
Come on in, guys.

866
01:17:02,243 --> 01:17:06,288
There's just one little thing
which is, I wrote this new song,

867
01:17:06,372 --> 01:17:09,541
and I'm not sure if it's any good, so I was...

868
01:17:10,585 --> 01:17:11,919
Thanks.

869
01:17:12,045 --> 01:17:15,798
I was hoping that I could play it for you
and you tell me what you think, okay?

870
01:17:15,882 --> 01:17:17,049
Okay.

871
01:17:17,133 --> 01:17:18,717
It's called Travis.

872
01:17:20,261 --> 01:17:22,221
And it goes like this.

873
01:18:02,929 --> 01:18:04,888
- What did you think?
- Is it over?

874
01:18:04,973 --> 01:18:07,432
Travis. I'm sorry.

875
01:18:08,434 --> 01:18:11,436
Is it... No. No, it's not, is it? No.

876
01:18:12,105 --> 01:18:14,982
We got a whole other part. Don't we, guys?

877
01:18:15,775 --> 01:18:19,611
And it goes like...

878
01:18:56,900 --> 01:18:58,859
What do you say?
Would you dance with me for real?

879
01:18:58,985 --> 01:19:01,194
You would? Oh, my gosh.

880
01:19:01,321 --> 01:19:04,823
Come on, boys, bring it home.
This is my lucky day.

881
01:19:05,867 --> 01:19:08,243
Oh, my gosh. Okay.

882
01:19:09,329 --> 01:19:11,246
Show me what you got.

883
01:19:14,375 --> 01:19:17,210
Come on, guys!
Are you going to dance with us?

884
01:19:20,006 --> 01:19:22,925
Let's see your moves on the floor now.

885
01:19:23,551 --> 01:19:26,553
Oh, yeah. I like those moves.

886
01:19:30,850 --> 01:19:33,352
Okay, bring it home for me.

887
01:19:37,523 --> 01:19:38,690
Yeah.

888
01:21:57,121 --> 01:21:59,998
I'm Nick Beres reporting live
outside the downtown arena

889
01:22:00,083 --> 01:22:03,960
where country music superstar Kelly Canter
is set to arrive any moment.

890
01:22:04,045 --> 01:22:07,130
Mrs Canter came down
with food poisoning in Houston.

891
01:22:07,215 --> 01:22:09,216
She didn't show up in Austin.

892
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:12,344
But her fans here have not given up hope.

893
01:22:14,180 --> 01:22:15,972
Almost a year ago today,

894
01:22:16,057 --> 01:22:18,350
Kelly Canter performed
at this very same arena

895
01:22:18,434 --> 01:22:22,521
in what became the most talked about
performance of the year.

896
01:22:22,605 --> 01:22:26,483
Mrs Canter, who was five months pregnant,
tripped over a microphone cord

897
01:22:26,567 --> 01:22:28,902
and fell 10 feet off the edge of the stage.

898
01:22:28,986 --> 01:22:32,197
She had a blood-alcohol level
of.19 at the time.

899
01:22:32,281 --> 01:22:33,615
She's hit rock bottom.

900
01:22:33,699 --> 01:22:36,952
And sometimes you have to hit rock bottom
to realise what you had.

901
01:22:37,036 --> 01:22:40,122
And I think she's going to come back.
Better than ever.

902
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:50,924
I was here last year
when it all fell apart for Kelly.

903
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:53,635
I mean,
how many chances can someone get?

904
01:22:53,719 --> 01:22:56,138
I don't know. Let's ask the fans out there.
What do you think?

905
01:22:56,222 --> 01:22:58,598
Are you ready to hear Kelly's big encore?

906
01:23:17,076 --> 01:23:19,035
- You can't afford these.
- Don't worry about that.

907
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:21,329
- I can't take these.
- Put them on.

908
01:23:21,414 --> 01:23:24,374
- No.
- Put them on. I want to see them on.

909
01:23:37,889 --> 01:23:39,973
Better than gold balls?

910
01:23:42,226 --> 01:23:43,560
Yeah.

911
01:23:46,522 --> 01:23:49,733
I'm leaving after the show,
heading to California.

912
01:23:49,817 --> 01:23:50,901
Why?

913
01:23:50,985 --> 01:23:53,195
There's an opportunity for me out there.

914
01:23:54,030 --> 01:23:57,157
A friend of a friend
has got a ranch on the beach

915
01:23:57,241 --> 01:23:59,576
and needs somebody to help him out.

916
01:23:59,660 --> 01:24:01,494
Somebody like you.

917
01:24:02,455 --> 01:24:03,955
And you.

918
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:07,584
- What about our music?
- That's the best part.

919
01:24:08,252 --> 01:24:12,422
There's this bar right in the centre of town
that just lost its Saturday night lineup,

920
01:24:12,506 --> 01:24:14,883
and I know it's not a 10-city tour or anything,

921
01:24:14,967 --> 01:24:18,803
but it's a bunch of hard-working people
that like to listen to good music

922
01:24:18,888 --> 01:24:20,305
while they drink their beer.

923
01:24:21,724 --> 01:24:24,809
I just figured
maybe we could write during the day,

924
01:24:24,894 --> 01:24:27,145
see if we come up with anything,

925
01:24:27,605 --> 01:24:29,522
enough to write an album.

926
01:24:30,274 --> 01:24:33,360
I already have enough songs
to make an album.

927
01:24:37,740 --> 01:24:40,492
If you want to sing those country pop songs,
you go right ahead.

928
01:24:40,952 --> 01:24:43,703
- But you're better than that, Chiles.
- No, I'm not.

929
01:24:43,788 --> 01:24:47,415
Yes, you are. I swear it. Just because
they might put them on the radio

930
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:48,792
it doesn't mean they're worth a damn.

931
01:24:59,053 --> 01:25:01,638
I've never seen the beach before.

932
01:25:01,722 --> 01:25:03,515
So come with me.

933
01:25:09,855 --> 01:25:11,064
Okay.

934
01:25:15,861 --> 01:25:17,279
You will?

935
01:25:23,828 --> 01:25:27,455
- We're ready for you, Beau.
- All right.

936
01:25:30,376 --> 01:25:31,584
Okay.

937
01:25:36,424 --> 01:25:37,674
Beau.

938
01:25:40,386 --> 01:25:43,430
What if you gave me a little time
to think about it?

939
01:25:47,893 --> 01:25:50,812
You take all the time you need.

940
01:25:53,482 --> 01:25:55,817
Good evening, Dallas.

941
01:25:55,901 --> 01:25:58,611
Welcome to the Kelly Canter Encore Tour.

942
01:26:00,072 --> 01:26:01,990
Now, to start things off,

943
01:26:02,074 --> 01:26:06,411
let's hear it for the man you fell in love with
back in Nashville,

944
01:26:06,495 --> 01:26:08,621
Beau Hutton!

945
01:26:21,802 --> 01:26:23,595
I love you, Beau!

946
01:26:23,679 --> 01:26:26,931
I'd like to dedicate this first song
to Kelly Canter.

947
01:26:28,184 --> 01:26:31,394
She's the reason I'm here. She's a true talent.

948
01:26:32,229 --> 01:26:36,566
This one's not on the set list,
but that doesn't mean it isn't pretty.

949
01:26:37,151 --> 01:26:38,985
This one's for you, Kelly.

950
01:27:24,782 --> 01:27:25,907
Pretty.

951
01:27:26,492 --> 01:27:28,201
Thank you.

952
01:27:28,285 --> 01:27:32,163
- You got a pen and paper?
- Yeah, sure.

953
01:27:32,248 --> 01:27:35,375
I've been thinking of some things
that I want to tell you.

954
01:27:35,459 --> 01:27:36,709
Okay.

955
01:27:39,422 --> 01:27:45,260
Don't ever wear satin on stage
'cause it wrinkles like anything,

956
01:27:45,344 --> 01:27:50,390
and your sweat will show right through it,
I don't care how pretty the dress is.

957
01:27:51,100 --> 01:27:55,562
Always travel with your costumes
and if anything ever needs mending,

958
01:27:55,646 --> 01:27:59,816
send it to Arturo in Beverly Hills.
He's the best.

959
01:28:01,193 --> 01:28:03,361
Don't take laxatives ever

960
01:28:03,446 --> 01:28:06,156
because they never work
the way you want them to.

961
01:28:08,534 --> 01:28:11,619
Don't drink anything carbonated
on a show day.

962
01:28:11,704 --> 01:28:13,580
Okay? It'll make you bloat.

963
01:28:14,331 --> 01:28:17,542
Wear high heels everywhere you go.

964
01:28:17,626 --> 01:28:20,378
And when it comes to
writing your own songs,

965
01:28:20,463 --> 01:28:22,130
don't get too concerned about it, all right?

966
01:28:22,339 --> 01:28:25,592
Your motto should always be,
"The best song wins."

967
01:28:28,721 --> 01:28:30,930
And don't be afraid to fall in love.

968
01:28:34,852 --> 01:28:37,854
It's the only thing that matters in life.

969
01:28:38,397 --> 01:28:42,025
The only thing.
Do you understand what I'm telling you?

970
01:28:43,235 --> 01:28:44,861
Yeah.

971
01:28:46,238 --> 01:28:49,908
You just fall in love
with as many things as possible.

972
01:28:56,957 --> 01:29:00,293
You're going to have to find a way
to tell people about your parents

973
01:29:00,377 --> 01:29:02,795
'cause they're not school teachers, are they?

974
01:29:06,842 --> 01:29:10,720
Have either one of them been in prison
for anything violent?

975
01:29:12,306 --> 01:29:13,598
Yeah.

976
01:29:16,185 --> 01:29:17,727
Are they out?

977
01:29:19,396 --> 01:29:21,064
My mom is.

978
01:29:24,693 --> 01:29:27,904
Well, you got to work with a publicist

979
01:29:27,988 --> 01:29:31,366
and decide the best way to get it out.

980
01:29:32,368 --> 01:29:36,871
You never want to hide anything
from your fans. It's just not worth it.

981
01:29:39,792 --> 01:29:41,167
Okay?

982
01:29:42,753 --> 01:29:44,045
Okay.

983
01:29:49,927 --> 01:29:51,636
How did you know?

984
01:29:55,808 --> 01:29:58,142
I just had a feeling.

985
01:30:53,824 --> 01:30:55,700
Thank you very much.

986
01:30:57,536 --> 01:30:59,329
We got somebody special coming up.

987
01:30:59,413 --> 01:31:02,040
I want you to give a warm welcome
to Miss Chiles Stanton.

988
01:31:05,002 --> 01:31:11,090
Wow. That is a welcome dreams are made of.
Thank y'all so much.

989
01:31:11,175 --> 01:31:14,719
Mr Beau Hutton, everyone. Isn't he the best?

990
01:31:51,965 --> 01:31:55,385
Hey. Thanks for the song.

991
01:31:55,469 --> 01:31:57,470
You might have been the only one
that liked it.

992
01:31:57,554 --> 01:31:59,681
Come on, now.

993
01:32:08,482 --> 01:32:12,819
- I guess they're not buying the bad shrimp.
- Yeah, I guess not.

994
01:32:13,278 --> 01:32:16,656
- Do you think I'm crazy?
- No.

995
01:32:17,491 --> 01:32:21,703
I just don't think love and fame
can live in the same place.

996
01:32:23,956 --> 01:32:26,290
I loved that baby, too, Beau.

997
01:32:28,544 --> 01:32:32,171
I was sadder than anybody when I lost it.

998
01:32:35,843 --> 01:32:37,844
I can't change my past.

999
01:32:38,846 --> 01:32:41,764
You know? I can't change how much I drank.

1000
01:32:45,477 --> 01:32:48,938
I'm stronger than all this.
You know that, right?

1001
01:32:49,022 --> 01:32:50,982
I know.

1002
01:32:52,443 --> 01:32:54,986
I'm going to give them one hell of a show.

1003
01:32:55,070 --> 01:32:56,946
I thought you would.

1004
01:32:58,532 --> 01:32:59,949
Come here.

1005
01:34:18,946 --> 01:34:21,155
You got a full house out there.

1006
01:34:22,115 --> 01:34:23,574
I heard.

1007
01:34:36,505 --> 01:34:38,548
I've never loved anybody like I loved you.

1008
01:34:41,510 --> 01:34:43,386
You know that, right?

1009
01:34:49,142 --> 01:34:51,936
Let's just get through tonight, okay?

1010
01:35:03,240 --> 01:35:04,323
Hey, Dove.

1011
01:35:08,787 --> 01:35:11,330
Give them hell tonight, okay?

1012
01:35:50,746 --> 01:35:53,664
Ladies and gentlemen,

1013
01:35:53,749 --> 01:35:58,169
let's welcome back to Dallas
the lady you've been waiting to see,

1014
01:35:58,253 --> 01:36:01,964
the belle of Bristol, six-time Grammy winner,

1015
01:36:02,049 --> 01:36:06,427
country superstar Kelly Canter.

1016
01:39:06,066 --> 01:39:07,191
Yeah!

1017
01:42:39,321 --> 01:42:41,905
That's how it's done, sweetheart.

1018
01:42:59,090 --> 01:43:00,424
Okay?

1019
01:43:45,887 --> 01:43:50,391
Okay, we got The Chronicle here.
They want pictures. Chiles, you, too.

1020
01:43:53,061 --> 01:43:55,938
Earlier tonight,
this stadium pulsed with excitement

1021
01:43:56,022 --> 01:43:59,900
over an incredible performance
by country superstar Kelly Canter.

1022
01:43:59,984 --> 01:44:04,613
But it still begs the inevitable question,
"How long will her sobriety last?"

1023
01:44:07,700 --> 01:44:09,660
Fill it up! Let's go!

1024
01:44:11,079 --> 01:44:12,371
- James.
- Yeah.

1025
01:44:12,455 --> 01:44:14,623
Hi. What can we expect next from Kelly?

1026
01:44:14,707 --> 01:44:17,042
Well, more songs, more shows,

1027
01:44:17,127 --> 01:44:19,086
and a hell of a lot more
of what we saw tonight.

1028
01:44:19,671 --> 01:44:21,672
- Beau, look this way!
- Beau, right here!

1029
01:44:21,756 --> 01:44:24,925
Well done, James. It looks like Kelly's
going to get her encore after all.

1030
01:44:25,009 --> 01:44:27,219
Well, now, we couldn't have done it
without you, could we?

1031
01:44:27,303 --> 01:44:29,972
Thanks, man. I'll see you in Nashville.
We'll talk about some more dates.

1032
01:44:30,056 --> 01:44:32,015
Yeah, JJ. All right. Yeah, thanks.

1033
01:44:32,100 --> 01:44:34,810
- Who needs a drink?
- Right here. One for me, one for you.

1034
01:44:34,894 --> 01:44:36,728
Next week, I'm recording my new single,

1035
01:44:36,813 --> 01:44:40,899
and hopefully continuing
on this amazing tour.

1036
01:44:40,984 --> 01:44:42,067
- Hey, Beau.
- Where's Kell?

1037
01:44:42,152 --> 01:44:43,444
Jesse Clark of Country FM.

1038
01:44:43,528 --> 01:44:45,571
She's just cleaning up a bit.
She'll be back out.

1039
01:44:45,655 --> 01:44:48,490
Great set. How does it feel
to have your career change overnight?

1040
01:45:06,134 --> 01:45:09,011
Kell? Kell...

1041
01:45:14,309 --> 01:45:17,978
Kell? Kell. Kelly!

1042
01:45:21,316 --> 01:45:24,234
Kelly. Hey, Kelly.

1043
01:45:25,153 --> 01:45:28,113
What did you take?
Kelly, how many did you take? Kelly!

1044
01:45:28,573 --> 01:45:31,909
Come on, wake up. Wake up.
How many did you take, Kelly?

1045
01:48:10,943 --> 01:48:12,903
Dear Beau.

1046
01:48:12,987 --> 01:48:17,157
You once told me that love and fame
can't live in the same place.

1047
01:48:17,241 --> 01:48:20,535
If that is true,
there's only one choice to make,

1048
01:48:20,620 --> 01:48:24,414
especially for someone as gentle
and loving as you.

1049
01:48:24,499 --> 01:48:28,085
I don't regret a single moment
we spent together.

1050
01:48:28,169 --> 01:48:31,630
You filled my last days with true happiness.

1051
01:48:31,714 --> 01:48:33,632
So choose love.

1052
01:48:34,342 --> 01:48:37,094
Take off and don't look back.

1053
01:48:37,178 --> 01:48:41,515
Because there is no one
more worthy of love than you.

1054
01:48:46,396 --> 01:48:49,189
Waylon said it best when he sang to Willie.

1055
01:48:49,273 --> 01:48:53,235
"If you see me getting smaller,
I'm leaving, don't be grieving.

1056
01:48:53,319 --> 01:48:55,821
"I just got to get away from here.

1057
01:48:57,323 --> 01:49:01,493
"If you see me getting smaller,
don't worry, I'm in no hurry.

1058
01:49:02,662 --> 01:49:05,247
"I've got the right to disappear."

1059
01:49:58,801 --> 01:50:02,554
Thank you. Thank you all for coming out
tonight on a Saturday night.

1060
01:50:02,638 --> 01:50:04,556
You've been real kind.

1061
01:50:04,640 --> 01:50:07,184
- Play another one, Beau.
- All right, then.

1062
01:50:07,268 --> 01:50:09,311
This one's called Chances Are.

1063
01:50:18,905 --> 01:50:20,614
Well, goddamn.

1064
01:50:28,539 --> 01:50:31,208
I'd like to bring a friend on stage,

1065
01:50:32,668 --> 01:50:35,754
a wonderful songwriter I met in Nashville.

1066
01:50:36,964 --> 01:50:39,299
She just so happens to be here tonight.

1067
01:50:41,052 --> 01:50:44,387
Will you welcome to the stage
Miss Chiles Stanton.

1068
01:50:55,858 --> 01:50:58,026
And this one's called Give In To Me.

1069
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:02,148
