1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,074


2
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:13,369
- It's him, it's Dad. He's here.
- That'll be him now, Nelly.

3
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:17,577
- Here.
- About time, I've been worried.

4
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:18,824
Good lad.

5
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:24,914
Dad! I've been waiting for you.
Have you got my things?

6
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,540
- Have you got my whip?
- Easy, Cathy, hold on.

7
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:28,087
Did you get my Whip?

8
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:30,256
- Slow down.
- Where have you been?

9
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:32,095
- There you are, sir.
- Joseph.

10
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,965
Mr Earnshaw, sir.
We were worried, what with t'weather.

11
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:37,639
You're soaked through.
Come and sit by t'fire.

12
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:38,806
Get yourself warmed up, sir.

13
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:40,770
Hold on.
I've got a surprise for you.

14
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:47,774
Leave him.

15
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:57,199
I found him in the street.

16
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:01,909
Well, he had no one.

17
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,957
- So I thought...
- What'?

18
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:11,210
It was the Christian thing to do.

19
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,727
Say hello.

20
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,767
- Fairydog!

21
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:29,736
Shame on you, Catherine Earnshaw!
Go on!

22
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:39,450
Nelly, can you clean him up?

23
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:49,669
Let go! No.

24
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,506
Give me the jacket.

25
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:01,723
Just fuck off, Fairydog.

26
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,516
You ungrateful little...

27
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,131
Sleep well?

28
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:04,929
Move.

29
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,871
Are you hurt?

30
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,498
Can you understand me?

31
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:22,760
Come.

32
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:26,343
Come on!

33
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:21,462
Come on!

34
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:47,749
That's a hen harrier.

35
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:06,393
That's a moorcock.

36
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,828
That's a lapwing, my favourite.

37
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:36,760
You say it. Lapwing.

38
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,179
Lapkwing.

39
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:44,597
Lapwing.

40
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:23,029
"For I will take you
from among the heathen"

41
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:25,498
"and gather you out of all countries"

42
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:28,539
"and will bring you into your own land."

43
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:35,042
"Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you
and ye shall be clean."

44
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:40,260
"From all your filthiness
and from all your idols,

45
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,053
will I cleanse you."

46
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:44,885
And what will be his name?

47
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:50,185
Heathcliff.

48
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:53,606
Heathcliff, do you reject Satan?

49
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:54,818
Come on.

50
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,613
No, lad.

51
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,403
Don't struggle, now.

52
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:04,029
Be still.

53
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:13,421
Hey, Heathcliff. Heathcliff!

54
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:29,645
Cathy?!

55
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,898
Cathy!

56
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:38,400
Cathy?!

57
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,492
He's gone.

58
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:27,320
Close your eyes.

59
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,239
Come on, it's nice.

60
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,078
Open your mouth.

61
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:10,739
Heathens.

62
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:19,422
- God forgive you both. Eh?
- But we didn't...

63
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,212
Get to your room and shut up!

64
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:23,380
I don't want to see you again tonight!

65
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,359
Steady!

66
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:38,330
Come on.

67
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,461
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

68
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:41,917
Hey!

69
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:54,976
- Steady.

70
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:01,562
Which one would you like, Heathcliff?

71
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,810
Eh? You need your own.

72
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:18,457
- The grey.
- Excellent.

73
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,415
Hindley, you can have the other.

74
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:29,798
Come on.

75
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,342
- Come on.

76
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:50,856
There's something wrong.

77
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:55,991
I think he's lame.

78
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:16,052
Where you going?

79
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:30,320
Give me your horse.

80
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,903
Fuck off, you dog.

81
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:37,491
Want me to show him what you do?

82
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:50,799
I'll tell him.

83
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,169
Take my horse, then, you damn gypsy.

84
00:20:53,294 --> 00:20:56,594
I hope it breaks your neck
and kicks your fucking brains out.

85
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:14,949
Let me see.

86
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,205
I'm sorry.

87
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:43,303
You know, I've tried to teach you.

88
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:47,231
Tried to show you
how to be a good Christian.

89
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,519
I'd hoped you'd have treated him
like he was your brother.

90
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:53,738
He's not my
brother, he's a nigger.

91
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:56,983
You leave me no option, lad.
Hold your hand out.

92
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:58,324
Hand out!

93
00:21:58,442 --> 00:21:59,489
Out!

94
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:15,668
Now get out of me sight.

95
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:48,451
I hope you don't feel pleasure at this.

96
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:52,004
Hey, look at me.

97
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:30,538
Joseph!

98
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:32,874
Come here!

99
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:47,051
- Here we are, lad.
- Give it here.

100
00:23:47,176 --> 00:23:49,929
- Grab that.
- Look after yourself, Hindley.

101
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:56,318
An education'll be the making of you, lad.

102
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:59,146
- Go on.
- Take care, sir.

103
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,648
Safe journey, lad.

104
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:02,901
- In you get.
- Bye, Hindley.

105
00:24:03,025 --> 00:24:05,323
- Bye, Hindley.
- Mind how you go.

106
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:20,982
Ow!

107
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,617
- Dad!
- Cathy!

108
00:26:21,872 --> 00:26:23,249
Bad child.

109
00:26:24,041 --> 00:26:27,671
How can I love you?
I regret the day that you were born.

110
00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:33,142
Go on, both of you.
Go and get out of those wet clothes.

111
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:35,306
- Hey!

112
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,525
And ask God to forgive you both.

113
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,371
Sing for us, Cathy.

114
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:12,209
Why can't you always be
such a good lass, Cathy?

115
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:17,757
Why can't you always be
such a good man, Father?

116
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:52,792
What the devil were that?

117
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,920
Go see to it, Heathcliff.

118
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,992
Just go! Go and fetch the doctor!

119
00:30:27,117 --> 00:30:28,744
Will you just go now, woman?!

120
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:35,592
Right, Cathy. Come on, out!

121
00:30:35,709 --> 00:30:36,926
Come on!

122
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:42,216
No, I'm not leaving my dad!
- Cathy!

123
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:45,390
- Cathy, get upstairs, will you?
- No! No! No!

124
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,638
Heathcliff! Take Cathy upstairs!

125
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:48,889
Now!

126
00:30:50,891 --> 00:30:53,394
Let me see my dad!

127
00:32:34,578 --> 00:32:36,046
It's Hindley.

128
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:38,336
He's got someone wi' 'im.

129
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:43,962
Hello, Hindley.

130
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:47,303
- Hey, good girl.
- You're home. Who's her?

131
00:32:47,424 --> 00:32:49,518
Here we are, love.

132
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,393
Well... welcome home, sir.

133
00:33:00,187 --> 00:33:01,985
Joseph, meet my wife, Frances.

134
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:04,699
- Pleasure to meet you, madam.
- Hello, Joseph.

135
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:08,537
You must both be cold and hungry
after all that, so let's get you inside.

136
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:11,953
- This is my sister, Cathy.
- Nice to meet you.

137
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:14,041
Who's this, Hindley?

138
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:15,206
Heathcliff.

139
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:18,001
- Come and help with the bags. Take 'em in.
- Hindley!

140
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:20,044
Don't start, Cathy. I'm in charge now.

141
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:21,963
Come on, let's go in.

142
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:26,046
- Did you hear me?
- Don't be so hateful, Hindley.

143
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:27,798
Your choice, nigger.

144
00:33:27,923 --> 00:33:29,675
Work or leave.

145
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:33,641
Cathy.

146
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,393
Come on, choose. I'm waiting.

147
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:38,893
Come on, Cathy. Let's go inside.

148
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,519
Get the trunk.

149
00:33:43,939 --> 00:33:45,156
When you've done that,

150
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:48,402
get your stuff and move in
with the animals where you belong.

151
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:50,074
You're a fucking idiot, Hindley.

152
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:52,698
Things are gonna change round here.

153
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:00,539
"He shall cover thee with his feathers
and under his wings shalt thou trust."

154
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:04,259
"Thou shalt not be afraid
of the terror by night,"

155
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:06,595
"not by the arrow that ﬂieth by day,"

156
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:09,806
"nor for the pestilence
that walketh in darkness,"

157
00:34:09,923 --> 00:34:11,470
"nor for the destruction..."

158
00:34:28,275 --> 00:34:30,152
I think they're the new people.

159
00:34:30,277 --> 00:34:32,575
How do? Afternoon.

160
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:57,766
Is that the young black
Earnshaw found in Liverpool?

161
00:34:57,887 --> 00:35:00,140
Might make some improvements.

162
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:03,235
- Still got trees to pull up then?
- Outside.

163
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:04,898
Bring this place up to date.

164
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,488
Aye, it needs it.

165
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:17,616
That'll do, Heathcliff.

166
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:19,785
Heathcliff.

167
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:42,750
Heathcliff!

168
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:45,037
Heathcliff!

169
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:52,669
Heathcliff!

170
00:36:52,794 --> 00:36:54,171
I'm done here.

171
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:56,639
- Come on!
- The two of you will go to hell!

172
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:58,258
See you there, Joseph.

173
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:00,886
Useless, he is.

174
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:03,309
- Quick.
- Good for nothing!

175
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,987
You eat like a pig.

176
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:19,742
Ow!

177
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:49,601
No, it's not his fault,
I made him stop working!

178
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:51,652
Hindley, he's our brother!

179
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:53,818
Don't be stupid, look at him.

180
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:56,407
Stop it!

181
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:57,491
Cathy, go away!

182
00:37:57,609 --> 00:37:59,657
You get off me!

183
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:01,075
Get off me!

184
00:38:01,196 --> 00:38:02,948
You... No! No!

185
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:06,451
You know if our dad were still here,
he'd see what a hateful bastard you are

186
00:38:06,576 --> 00:38:08,670
and he'd be ashamed of you!

187
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:13,925
- Leave him alone!
- Even the animals work round here.

188
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:15,760
You're here to work!

189
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:17,299
You'll work!

190
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,343
You OK, my love?

191
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:26,365
Let me see your back.

192
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,282
Isn't that where the new
people live, there?

193
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:54,578
That big house?

194
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,963
Race you there.

195
00:41:45,795 --> 00:41:47,217
Come on.

196
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:21,088
It's my dog It's ours.

197
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:27,800
It's my dog. Get off him!

198
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,422
What idiots.

199
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:33,843
Father!

200
00:42:35,762 --> 00:42:36,854
Father!

201
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:42,894
Somebody's got me! Run!

202
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:45,272
- Cathy!

203
00:42:48,441 --> 00:42:50,614
Get off!

204
00:42:51,027 --> 00:42:52,904
Skulker, get away!

205
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:54,823
Go on, get away! Get away!

206
00:42:57,617 --> 00:42:59,665
Get out! Go on! Get out!

207
00:42:59,786 --> 00:43:01,880
- Come on, lass.
- Cathy?

208
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,177
Robert?

209
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:10,763
Skulker's had a lass, sir.

210
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,599
There's a lad here too,
a right out-and-outer.

211
00:43:27,772 --> 00:43:29,024
Just a boy.

212
00:43:30,066 --> 00:43:31,818
We should hang you now,
before you get any older.

213
00:43:31,943 --> 00:43:32,990
Do the county a favour.

214
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:34,454
Fuck you all, cunts.

215
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:38,165
It's Cathy Earnshaw.

216
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:40,626
I heard her brother lets her run wild.

217
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:42,495
And you're the boy
Earnshaw got from Liverpool.

218
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,167
The little lascar. The stowaway.

219
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:46,256
That makes sense.
Did you hear his language?

220
00:43:46,374 --> 00:43:49,753
- You set the dog on us. Stupid whore.
- Robert, throw him out.

221
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:52,805
And send someone to fetch Dr Kenneth.

222
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:54,932
- Girls, fetch some water...
- Cathy!

223
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:56,517
And brandy.

224
00:43:57,885 --> 00:43:58,886
Get out!

225
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:06,602
Would you like one?

226
00:44:22,827 --> 00:44:24,500
How do, Kenneth?

227
00:44:39,552 --> 00:44:40,678
Go on.

228
00:44:56,611 --> 00:44:58,284
Hindley's looking for you.

229
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:12,961
Heathcliff!

230
00:45:17,882 --> 00:45:19,384
I should beat you.

231
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:23,263
When Cathy comes home,
you are not to speak to her.

232
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:25,060
Is that clear'?

233
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:37,110
If I see you talking to her
without my permission,

234
00:45:37,235 --> 00:45:38,908
you will be told to leave.

235
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,254
Hindley, I need you.

236
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:52,675
You know, I think it's good that
Cathy's going to go stay with the Lintons.

237
00:45:52,792 --> 00:45:54,260
It'll do her good.

238
00:46:58,357 --> 00:46:59,700
I prefer the Moorcock.

239
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:03,993
I've got a big collection of it at
home and I've got lots of lapwing feathers.

240
00:47:06,157 --> 00:47:09,286
You'd like it at the Heights.
It's different to here though.

241
00:47:53,329 --> 00:47:54,706
Joseph!

242
00:48:07,176 --> 00:48:09,895
Look at you! How smart!

243
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:13,228
Joseph, grab the reins.

244
00:48:17,937 --> 00:48:22,363
What a wonderful dress.
We hardly recognised you.

245
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:25,574
I've got him, I've got him.

246
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:28,573
- Hold him while I get down.
- I've got him.

247
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:31,576
Been quiet round here without you.

248
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:36,755
Come on, then, let's get you in.

249
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:06,785
Cathy!
Look at you! You're a beauty.

250
00:49:06,902 --> 00:49:08,825
- Hindley!
- Don't she look well?

251
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:10,539
Cathy, I love this dress.

252
00:49:10,656 --> 00:49:13,159
- Isabella gave it to me.
- Aren't you lucky?

253
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:14,877
I said a stay at the Lintons'
would do her good.

254
00:49:14,994 --> 00:49:17,793
Where's Heathcliff? Where is he?

255
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:20,291
He's somewhere. I saw him earlier.

256
00:49:22,251 --> 00:49:24,299
- Tea, anyone?
- Yes, please.

257
00:49:26,464 --> 00:49:27,716
Heathcliff!

258
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:32,436
God's sake.

259
00:49:43,272 --> 00:49:44,774
Aren't you pleased to see me?

260
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:48,986
Are you laughing at me?

261
00:49:49,111 --> 00:49:50,988
Didn't mean to laugh.

262
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:54,704
All you have to do is wash and clean up

263
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:56,452
and you won't look so bad.

264
00:49:56,994 --> 00:49:59,042
You do look dirty.

265
00:50:02,291 --> 00:50:03,508
You didn't have to touch me.

266
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:05,006
Heathcliff?

267
00:50:13,511 --> 00:50:14,854
I like being dirty.

268
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:34,369
I can help make you look smart,
if you like.

269
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:41,421
If you come now,
I can sort you out before dinner.

270
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:39,472
I want to be good.
Can you clean me up?

271
00:51:40,264 --> 00:51:41,481
That's more like it.

272
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:45,899
The Linton's are coming today.
We'll have to get you clean like that Edgar.

273
00:52:11,295 --> 00:52:12,512
Let me see.

274
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:17,472
Look at you. You're a prince.

275
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:22,390
I bet your mother was an African queen...

276
00:52:22,514 --> 00:52:24,642
and your father a Chinese emperor.

277
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:29,989
I think somebody must have kidnapped you
and brought you to England.

278
00:52:46,538 --> 00:52:49,508
- Hello, Edgar. Hello, Isabella.
- Hello.

279
00:52:52,336 --> 00:52:54,714
- So you got here all right, then?
- Yes.

280
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:57,808
Just need a hand.
We've got some barrels.

281
00:52:59,551 --> 00:53:02,896
- There we go.
- Nelly's been cooking all morning.

282
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:05,808
You do like goose, don't you?

283
00:53:07,518 --> 00:53:09,486
Goose, my favourite.

284
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:15,283
Right, it's this way.

285
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:17,861
Come on.

286
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:34,511
That looks nice, Nelly.

287
00:53:35,504 --> 00:53:37,177
You sit there.

288
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:41,268
Look at this. This looks nice.

289
00:53:41,385 --> 00:53:43,183
Well, look at you, Heathcliff.

290
00:53:43,721 --> 00:53:44,688
Get out!

291
00:53:44,805 --> 00:53:47,900
Look at him, he's all dressed up
like a little circus monkey.

292
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:52,278
- Get out!
- Heathcliff!

293
00:53:52,396 --> 00:53:54,273
You idiot-
You should have just spoken to him.

294
00:53:54,398 --> 00:53:56,901
He'll be beaten now.
I hate it when he's beaten.

295
00:53:57,568 --> 00:53:58,865
Get off him!

296
00:54:01,405 --> 00:54:02,907
Get off him!

297
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:08,291
Hindley! No!

298
00:54:08,412 --> 00:54:10,460
Stop it, Hindley!

299
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:17,429
Off him, Hindley.

300
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:22,350
Heathcliff.

301
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:25,513
Oi! What's going on?
What's he done now?

302
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:28,356
Take him in.
I don't want to see him. Lock him up.

303
00:54:29,391 --> 00:54:32,144
Get up, lad. Get up!

304
00:54:49,787 --> 00:54:50,959
Come on.

305
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:54,666
Here we are.

306
00:55:15,896 --> 00:55:17,022
Heathcliff?

307
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:36,421
Can you hear?

308
00:55:38,502 --> 00:55:40,220
The band's here.

309
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:57,316
Are you hurt?

310
00:56:50,032 --> 00:56:52,410
He should be back now.

311
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:16,816
Nelly! Nelly, come quick!

312
00:57:16,934 --> 00:57:19,733
- The baby's coming!
- Tell Hindley.

313
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:22,106
And get Dr Kenneth. Quick!

314
00:57:43,627 --> 00:57:45,846
Oh, it's coming, it's coming!

315
00:57:45,963 --> 00:57:47,010
I can't...

316
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:02,563
That's it. Just breathe.

317
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:04,272
Push.

318
00:58:08,402 --> 00:58:11,747
It's coming, it's coming.
I can see its head.

319
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:15,875
"Blessed be the name of the Lord."

320
00:58:15,993 --> 00:58:19,793
"I will keep my mouth,
as it were a bridle."

321
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:23,167
"While the ungodly was in my sight,."

322
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:26,010
"I held my tongue and spake nothing."

323
00:58:27,087 --> 00:58:32,639
"I kept silence, even from good words,
but it was pain and grief to me."

324
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:38,683
"My heart was hot within me,
and while I was musing the fire kindled."

325
00:58:38,807 --> 00:58:41,481
"At last I spoke with my tongue."

326
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:45,363
"Lord, let me know mine end"

327
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:47,278
"and the number of my days."

328
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:30,594
Breathe in. Stand still.

329
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:35,507
That's a good girl.

330
01:00:39,845 --> 01:00:41,722
Do I look nice, Nelly?

331
01:00:42,848 --> 01:00:44,316
Lovely.

332
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:08,582
Hold still.

333
01:01:09,457 --> 01:01:10,959
Are you going anywhere?

334
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:13,337
- It's raining.
- Why you wearing that, then?

335
01:01:13,461 --> 01:01:15,509
Aren't you supposed to be working?

336
01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:17,716
No.

337
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:20,802
Joseph will tell.

338
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:24,773
He will never know. He's not here.

339
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:32,360
Nelly, you're brushing
all t'curls out my hair.

340
01:01:34,566 --> 01:01:36,864
- Up you come.

341
01:01:38,236 --> 01:01:39,488
Oh!

342
01:01:53,251 --> 01:01:54,252
What were you saying?

343
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:56,300
You spend more time with them than me.

344
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:59,349
- As if I'd notice.
- I notice.

345
01:02:01,092 --> 01:02:04,471
You never have anything to say.
May as well play with the baby.

346
01:02:06,598 --> 01:02:08,896
You never complained before.

347
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:16,278
I've not come too soon, have I?

348
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:17,992
No.

350
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:21,128
