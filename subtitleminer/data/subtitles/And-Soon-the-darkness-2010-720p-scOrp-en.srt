00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:02,822
Camila.

00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:39,441
( sobs )

13
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:24,270
(wind blowing )

14
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:27,030

Ready?

17
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:34,507
- I'm coming.
- You'll never beat me.

18
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:14,926
My God, look at this little town.
How cute is this?

19
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,216
Wow.

20
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,978
( music playing on radio )

21
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:22,763
Oh, come here.

22
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:30,604
- Hola.
- Hola.

23
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:37,198
You know, we're close to that river
that used to be

24
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:39,739
Argentina's main trade route
into Paraguay.

25
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:44,418
Apparently it used to be
a pretty happening town.

26
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:46,419
A lot of smugglers
and rough types.

27
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:48,421
Really?

28
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,833
I like it already.

29
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,967
Pick one.

30
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,298
Uh...

31
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:56,589
-this one. Yeah.
- This one?

32
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:58,428
Thanks.

33
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,103
Here you go.
You can keep the change.

34
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:02,226
Thanks.
I mean, gracias.

35
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:03,979
Woman:
De nada.

36
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:07,357

37
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:08,768

00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:22,114
Ellie:
Go on, ask her.

39
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:25,625
- Go.
- Um...

40
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:28,754
Buenas tardes.

41
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:32,962
Um, donde está
El Hotel Rosarnaria?

42
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:34,923
( speaking Spanish )

43
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,888
Okay. Gracias.

44
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,645
Did you get all that?

45
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:47,772
- Shut up.
- ( laughs)

46
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:01,328
(well squeaking )

47
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:20,222
(woman shouting in Spanish )

48
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:29,015
Hello?

49
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,188
Hola.

50
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:34,898
- Hello?
- Hola.

51
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:37,360
- Buenas noches.
- Buenas noches.

52
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:40,526
Um, me llamo es Stephanie.

53
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:42,410
Mm-hmm.

54
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,196
Y nosotros tenemos un, um...

55
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:46,035
You have a reservation?

56
00:06:46,198 --> 00:06:48,371
- You speak English.
- Yes.

57
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:51,958
Luca.
( speaks Spanish )

58
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:56,667
You stay only one night, yes?

59
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,460
Yes.
Actually, we leave tomorrow.

60
00:06:58,627 --> 00:07:01,551
Do you know what time the bus
to Posadas leaves?

61
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:04,102
At 8:00.
And it's the only one of the day.

62
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,555
Please tell me that's 8:00 PM.

63
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:10,313
I'm sorry.
It's 8:00 in the morning.

64
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:11,849
Figures.

65
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:14,017
- Your passport, please.
- Oh yeah.

66
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,278
Ellie.

67
00:07:19,815 --> 00:07:21,112
"Assport"?

68
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,446
- Ellie.
- ( laughs )

69
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:23,906
That's a good one.

70
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:31,285
You are not traveling alone,
are you?

71
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,455
Um, well, yes and no.

72
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:36,089
We were traveling with a bike tour

73
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:39,593
but we kind of went AWOL
after the first day.

74
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:43,130
Yes, I see.

75
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:47,472
Well, please let me know
if you need anything.

76
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,307
- Cool.
- Thank you.

77
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:50,595
Okay.

78
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:52,639
- Ciao.
- Ciao.

79
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:09,911
(whispering )

80
00:08:17,873 --> 00:08:18,999
One key.

81
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,964
Oh, gracias.

82
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:23,254
- Ah.
- Weirdo.

83
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,093
Stephanie: Cute.

84
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:27,883
Yeah, this is cute.

85
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:30,768
Hmm.

86
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,815
( sniffs )
Whoa!

87
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:39,739
First shower.

88
00:08:39,895 --> 00:08:42,648
Ugh, this is gross.

89
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,994
( shower running )

90
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,186
( phone ringing )

91
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:20,728
- ( sighs )
- ( phone beeps )

92
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,364
- ( exhales )
- ( pounding on door)

93
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:59,353
( water stops )

94
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:01,143
Ugh.
Hey, Steph.

95
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:02,902
There's no towels.

96
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:05,439
Yeah, coming.

97
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:09,158
Here are your towels.

98
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,820
Danke schoen.

99
00:10:11,987 --> 00:10:14,706
( music playing loudly )

100
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:29,300
( speaks Spanish )

101
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,851
What did you say to those guys?

102
00:10:32,007 --> 00:10:34,180
Nothing, just that you're single.

103
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:35,855
Gee, thanks, El.

104
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:42,526
Okay, I like the potential.

105
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:47,489
Yeah, it's nice.

106
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,776
Oh, excuse me.
Two cervezas, por favor.

107
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:53,821
- Gracias.
- ( phone ringing )

108
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,539
Is that Nick?

109
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:02,045
( phone beeps )

110
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:05,127
Seriously?
He's such a dick.

111
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,130
I know.

112
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:10,295
But maybe I should
just talk to him.

113
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:12,009
No. No no no.
Don't even think--

114
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:13,515
it's so not worth it.

115
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,266
I know, but...

116
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:17,098
You know I'm not--

117
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,512
I'm not good
at being alone.

118
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:21,306
I know, but I'm right here.

119
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:22,770
Okay?

120
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:26,152
- We had fun.
- Yeah, absolutely.

121
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:28,609
We're about to have more fun too.

122
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:31,695
Gracias.

123
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:34,156
Um, disculpe.

124
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:37,163
We didn't order these.

125
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:40,371
( speaks Spanish )

126
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:45,664
Don't be rude.

127
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,833
( sighs )

128
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:51,970
Mmm!

129
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:55,007
Whoo!
All right!

130
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:00,523
- No no.
- Yeah yeah.

131
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:02,817
- Ellie, no. Seriously, I'm done.
- Just shut up and drink.

132
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,235
Tomorrow's gonna suck.

133
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:06,519
Yes, but that's what Advil is for.

134
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:09,278
Come on, it's our last night.

135
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:11,781
To you and me.

136
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,783
Both:
Salud.

137
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:18,325
( both groan )

138
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:20,490
- I can't--
- That was hard.

139
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:23,035
Whoo.

140
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:34,220
Ellie:
What about him?

141
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:36,723
I don't know.
You think he's my type?

142
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:39,100
Totally.
He looks...

143
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:41,057
Responsible.

144
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:44,567
( laughs )

145
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:53,314
Should I invite him over?
I can totally invite him over.

146
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,449
- No. El, stop. Sit down.
- I’m gonna do that for you.

147
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,997
Jesus, sit down! Sit down!
He's gonna look over here, Ellie.

148
00:12:58,153 --> 00:13:00,201
- Stay.
- Isn't that the point?

149
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:02,331
( "Macarena" playing )

150
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,163
Oh my God.
Are you hearing this?

151
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:07,044
Do you hear this? Please don't
tell me you're not hearing this.

152
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,171
- What are you doing?
- I'm doing us all a favor.

153
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:12,584
Oh no no,
you cannot play that song.

154
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,343
( speaks Spanish )

155
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,345
( music stops )

156
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,893
- ( speaks Spanish )
- Ugh, Ellie.

157
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:21,847
My friend wants to know
why you don't like the song.

158
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:25,890
Well, 'cause there's a fine line
between irony and just plain bad.

159
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,194
Kind of like...

160
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:29,817
Your shirt.

161
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:31,853
( laughs )

162
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,773
All right.
No.

163
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:37,943
Nope.

164
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:40,111
Okay.

165
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:44,499
( music playing )

166
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:48,412
This one's for you, baby.

167
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,290
# I love myself #

168
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:55,210
# I want you to love me #

169
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:59,176
# When I feel down,
I want you above me #

170
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:03,640
# I search myself,
I want you to find me #

171
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:08,557
# I forget myself,
I want you to remind me #

172
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:13,691
# I don't want anybody else #

173
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,855
# When I think about you #

174
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:18,491
# I touch myself, ooh #

175
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:22,325
# I don't want anybody else... #

176
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:24,160
- Senor.
- # Oh no oh no #

177
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:25,995
# Oh no... #

178
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:28,626
Hey hey hey.
Take it easy.

179
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:30,753
- No problem here.
- # You're the one #

180
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:33,210
# Who makes me come running #

181
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:37,344
# You're the sun
who makes me shine #

182
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:41,348
# When you're around
I'm always laughing... #

183
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:43,258
Hey, where are you going?

184
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,847
Um, el peepee.

185
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:49,765
# I close my eyes
and see you above me #

186
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:54,402
# Think I would die
if you were to ignore me... #

187
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:58,698
Girl emergency.
Sorry.

188
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:04,113
# I'd do anything for you #

189
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:07,909
# I don't want anybody else... #

190
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:15,628
# Oh, I don't want... #

191
00:15:19,002 --> 00:15:21,050
( flushes toilet )

192
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:24,933
You're not from around
these parts, are you?

193
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,640
Performance anxiety?

194
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:37,069
- ( flushes )
- ( zips pants )

195
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:39,105
You should stick close
to your friend.

196
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:48,494
Wow.
That backfired.

197
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:52,411
# I honestly do,
I touch myself #

198
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:54,420
# I touch myself. #

199
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:02,175
( Spanish music playing )

200
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,139
- Hello.
- Hi.

201
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,729
- Do you want to sit?
- Yeah. Thank you.

202
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:21,315
- Let me take your picture.
- Okay.

203
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:24,776
- Did you get it?
- Mm, I got it.

204
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:28,321
Let me take one of you.

205
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,616
( man laughs )

206
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:32,659
- You think so?
- Yeah, I like it.

207
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,006
Now you're my prisoner.

208
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:25,590
Really?

209
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:27,926
- Does that mean I'm in trouble?
- Big trouble.

210
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:31,263
( both laugh )

211
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:34,896
(whispering in Spanish )

212
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:38,229
What?
What does that mean?

213
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,689
- It means that you...
- Yeah?

214
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:42,570
- ...your friend...
- My friend?

215
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:44,777
- ...and I...
- Uh-huh.

216
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:48,534
( laughs )
No way, Jose.

217
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:50,661
Not with that one.

218
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,290
Mmm.

219
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:57,744
( mouthing )

220
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:10,006
( dog barking )

221
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:18,856
(arguing in Spanish)

222
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:59,810
( bangs against door)

223
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,521
( moans )

224
00:19:03,935 --> 00:19:05,562
- Ellie: Ooh!
- ( thumps)

225
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:07,071
( sighs )

226
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:09,278
Ellie:
Oh my God.

227
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,535
( laughs )
You'll wake her up.

228
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,866
- Shh.
- Shh.

229
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:17,031
Silencio, por favor.

230
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:32,846
Let's go to my place.

231
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,007
Your place?
No no no. We can't.

232
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,142
Who says?

233
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:38,769
- Me says.
- Oh, you says?

234
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:40,601
Yeah, me...

235
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:44,934
- Come on, you're gonna love it.
- I know I'll love it.

236
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:47,320
( speaks Spanish )

237
00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:49,572
I know.
I just can't.

238
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,073
My friend, she's in--

239
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:52,609
(whispers )
she's inside.

240
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:55,324
Well, tell her to come.
Tell her to come.

241
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:56,999
I'm not gonna tell her to come.

242
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:01,664
Come on.

243
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:03,669
I live really close to here.

244
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:05,000
- I don't... we can't.
- Okay?

245
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:07,256
- I told you I can't go.
- Come on, you're coming with me.

246
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:09,713
- I'm not gonna come with you.
- ( thuds )

247
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:11,378
Okay, all right.
This hurts.

248
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:14,013
Ow, stop!
What the hell?

249
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:15,684
- Hey!
- Let me go!

250
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,308
- Get away from me!
- Come inside!

251
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:18,854
- Hey hey!
- Steph.

252
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:21,980
Come on, we are just having--

253
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:24,937
- Keep 'em closed.
- ( man speaking Spanish )

254
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:28,770
- ( pounding )
- ( screams )

255
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:31,610
( speaking Spanish )

256
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:33,774
- He's mean. Oh!
- ( pounding )

257
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:37,036
- ( man speaking Spanish )
- What? Habla la bamba?

258
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:39,947
Girls, open the goddamn door!

259
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:43,368
- Ooh.
- Jesus, you trying to get us killed?

260
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:45,832
- ( groans )
- Ellie, come outside.

261
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:47,872
Ellie!

262
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:52,130
Hey, asshole.

263
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:55,759
( both speaking Spanish )

264
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,102
Luca:
Qué pasa?

265
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:10,069
Qué pasa?

266
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:16,405
( speaking Spanish )

267
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:24,083
Sorry, girls.

268
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:26,209
Maybe next time, all right?

269
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:29,755
You too.

270
00:21:49,684 --> 00:21:51,778
Ellie:
Hey, Steph.

271
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:55,156
You saved me.

272
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:02,117
( animals chittering )

273
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:12,206
( groans )

274
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:21,473
Aw shit. Ellie, get up.
We're late.

275
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:24,511
Oh, no no no no.

276
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:26,805
Oh no.

277
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:28,393
I’m not kidding, El.

278
00:22:28,556 --> 00:22:30,354
- We cannot miss that bus.
- Oh no.

279
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:32,029
Wait!

280
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,697
Don't leave us here!

281
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:35,776
Wait!

282
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:37,656
No!

283
00:22:39,734 --> 00:22:41,736
( groans )

284
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,163
Stephanie:
Oh, we're screwed.

285
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:51,329
- We'll just take the next bus.
- There is no next bus.

286
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:53,793
Oh yeah.

287
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:56,425
Why did this have to happen
to us on the last day?

288
00:22:56,584 --> 00:22:58,882
Everything was going so great
until now.

289
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:04,342
Come on, let's go back.

290
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:13,396
So that's flight 206
at 1600 hours.

291
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:16,108
Um, that's 4:00 PM, right?

292
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:18,819
Okay. No, that's fine.
Thank you.

293
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:21,575
- Thank you, bye.
-( hangs up )

294
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:23,077
Are we good?

295
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,203
No, Ellie, we're not good.

296
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:27,035
We're both out 200 bucks.

297
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:32,416
Oh my gosh.
Wake me up never.

298
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:35,127
Come on, let's at least
do something fun.

299
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:37,041
I am doing something fun.

300
00:23:41,045 --> 00:23:43,013
You have not left.

301
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:46,927
Oh no.
Actually, we missed our bus.

302
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:50,438
But we wanted to go to this place...
Villa Del Lago.

303
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:52,439
Have you heard of it?

304
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:58,066
They say the water there
can cure polio.

305
00:23:58,229 --> 00:23:59,731
I don't have polio.

306
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:02,741
Villa Del Lago.

307
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:06,200
No, it's a ghost town now.
There is nothing to see.

308
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:09,866
If you must go somewhere,

309
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:14,128
go to see the waterfalls
or to see the caves.

310
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:16,630
- They are beautiful.
- That sounds like fun.

311
00:24:18,249 --> 00:24:20,297
Ellie.

312
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:23,554
All right, well, thank you.
Thank you. That's great.

313
00:24:30,261 --> 00:24:31,808
( sighs )

314
00:24:35,558 --> 00:24:38,277
( speaking Spanish )

315
00:24:42,273 --> 00:24:44,275
Rosa.

316
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:48,787
- Permiso, chicas.
- Thanks.

317
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:55,164
- Come on.
- Huh-uh.

318
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,955
- Come on, Ellie, let's go.
- Huh-uh, no!

319
00:24:58,122 --> 00:24:59,465
Wake up.

320
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:02,422
Dude, stop!

321
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:11,514
( growls )

322
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,698
Stephanie:
Oh, look at that.

323
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:26,010
Wow.

324
00:26:29,255 --> 00:26:31,303
Hey, let's just lay out here.

325
00:26:31,465 --> 00:26:34,218
- Ellie, really?
- Come on, just relax.

326
00:26:34,385 --> 00:26:36,513
We really don't have
anywhere to be.

327
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:38,352
( sighs )

328
00:26:39,682 --> 00:26:40,934
You win.

329
00:27:02,496 --> 00:27:04,089
Here, sunshine.

330
00:27:04,248 --> 00:27:05,966
It will all be okay.

331
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:08,219
I promise.

332
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:14,262
Thanks, El.

333
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:17,310
- ( pop music playing )
- All right.

334
00:27:31,108 --> 00:27:33,907
# I'm feeling blind #

335
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:36,663
# Like the sun's in my eyes #

336
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:39,200
# Since I'm fighting in a losing war #

337
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:43,917
# Tiny little fault lines
cracking inside my soul... #

338
00:27:51,962 --> 00:27:55,262
# I'm alive... #

339
00:28:00,763 --> 00:28:02,765
You ready?

340
00:28:04,475 --> 00:28:06,694
Ellie, I know you can hear me.

341
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:09,401
- Let's go.
- Huh-uh, later.

342
00:28:12,316 --> 00:28:14,410
And when exactly is later?

343
00:28:14,568 --> 00:28:16,741
I don't know, Steph.
When I'm ready.

344
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:22,460
Ow! What the hell?
I said I'm not ready.

345
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:25,713
Well, I am.
El, we can’t be here all day.

346
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:29,626
You really really need to learn
to have some fun.

347
00:28:29,792 --> 00:28:32,511
And what,
you're gonna teach me, I suppose?

348
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:35,673
Yeah, actually.
I probably could.

349
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:37,841
Where would we start, huh?

350
00:28:38,008 --> 00:28:40,557
The men's bathroom?
That sounds like fun.

351
00:28:42,012 --> 00:28:44,356
Okay.
No, that's great.

352
00:28:44,515 --> 00:28:45,767
I see where this is going.

353
00:28:45,933 --> 00:28:48,027
- Forget it.
- No.

354
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:51,189
Forget it. No, you're right.
If you didn't care before attacking him

355
00:28:51,355 --> 00:28:53,153
in the bathroom, you're certainly
not gonna care now.

356
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:55,943
Okay, Steph, I'm sorry.

357
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:59,865
If it's any consolation,
he didn't take the bait.

358
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:03,576
It's still really shitty, Ellie.

359
00:29:06,495 --> 00:29:09,374
- I guess you can't help it.
- What?

360
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:12,840
You know what? I probably actually
should have done something.

361
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:15,345
Because God knows
you never would have.

362
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:16,972
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

363
00:29:17,131 --> 00:29:19,179
You know what?
Just-- just forget about it.

364
00:29:19,341 --> 00:29:23,016
No, bullshit forget it.
Say what you mean.

365
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:26,603
I mean, Steph, God forbid you take
a chance on another guy

366
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:29,393
instead of dwelling
on the same old one.

367
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,983
He said we’d work it out, El.

368
00:29:32,146 --> 00:29:33,739
Stephanie, he cheated on you.

369
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:36,320
This is crazy to me that
you're still defending him.

370
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:38,872
You should have dumped
that guy right on the spot.

371
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:41,200
But you didn't.
And now you're hurt

372
00:29:41,363 --> 00:29:45,118
and I have to pick up your pieces
of yet another disaster relationship.

373
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:48,163
What? Is this coming
from you, the expert?

374
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:51,172
You think a relationship is when
you get the guy's last name.

375
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:54,209
Wow.

376
00:29:54,376 --> 00:29:55,753
You know what?
Screw you.

377
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,671
Nice.

378
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:07,105
Steph, wait.

379
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:08,891
Where are you going?

380
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:12,106
What do you care?
You're on vacation, Ellie.

381
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:14,442
I don't want you to have to worry
about cleaning up after me.

382
00:30:14,605 --> 00:30:16,107
Have fun.

383
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:48,305
( sighs )

384
00:31:02,736 --> 00:31:04,909
( sighs )

385
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:09,053
Come on, El, where are you?

386
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:37,130
(wind blowing )

387
00:33:07,611 --> 00:33:11,491
( man whispering )

388
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:23,301
(jet engine roaring )

389
00:33:37,766 --> 00:33:39,939
( twig snaps )

390
00:33:55,409 --> 00:33:57,662
( phone rings )

391
00:34:06,837 --> 00:34:09,340
(typing)

392
00:34:09,506 --> 00:34:11,600
( phone rings )

393
00:34:14,845 --> 00:34:17,268
( twig snaps )

394
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:22,853
- ( footsteps )
- ( bird screeching )

395
00:34:39,703 --> 00:34:42,456
( rustling )

396
00:34:45,709 --> 00:34:47,382
Oh my--

397
00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:11,235
( chatting )

398
00:35:45,936 --> 00:35:47,609
So it's me.

399
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:49,444
Um, where are you?

400
00:35:49,606 --> 00:35:51,700
I'm at the cow place now.

401
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:54,953
Um, okay.
So call me.

402
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:57,159
Bye.

403
00:36:23,473 --> 00:36:25,225
Hey'

404
00:36:25,392 --> 00:36:27,440
- Hi.
- Where's your friend?

405
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:29,070
Coming.

406
00:36:29,229 --> 00:36:31,231
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

407
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:36,160
Any minute now.

408
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:38,708
Oh hey, thanks for your help
last night with that guy.

409
00:36:38,864 --> 00:36:41,663
- He was a real creep.
- Yeah, he was.

410
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:48,461
You know what?
Probably got a flat or something.

411
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:51,547
I'd better go.
But see you around, uh...

412
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:53,838
- Michael.
- Stephanie.

413
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:58,019
Hey, where are you going?
I'll give you a lift.

414
00:36:59,259 --> 00:37:01,557
No, I'm okay.
Thanks though.

415
00:37:05,515 --> 00:37:07,688
Wait! No!

416
00:37:08,685 --> 00:37:11,564
Somebody! No!

417
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:13,903
( screams )

418
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,453
No!

419
00:37:15,609 --> 00:37:18,158
( screams )

420
00:38:12,582 --> 00:38:14,505
Hey'

421
00:38:16,962 --> 00:38:18,134
You follow me here?

422
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:21,891
Yeah. I just wanted to make sure
you were all right.

423
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:27,890
Are you?
'Cause you don't look it.

424
00:38:28,974 --> 00:38:30,317
Her bike is gone.

425
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:32,819
Well...

426
00:38:34,104 --> 00:38:35,447
Well, maybe she left already.

427
00:38:35,605 --> 00:38:37,448
No, there's only one road.

428
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:39,860
I mean, we would have
passed each other.

429
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:42,324
Right.

430
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:45,912
I'm gonna go inside
and look for her.

431
00:38:52,414 --> 00:38:54,416
Are you sure this is the place?

432
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:57,961
- Yeah, I'm positive.
-( phone ringing )

433
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:03,641
Do you hear that?

434
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,053
- It's over here somewhere.
- Ellie!

435
00:39:07,429 --> 00:39:09,306
( ringing )

436
00:39:14,728 --> 00:39:16,480
( beeps )

437
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:23,240
(dialing )

438
00:39:43,757 --> 00:39:45,680
Who are you calling?

439
00:39:45,842 --> 00:39:48,561
The police.

440
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:52,228
Good luck with that.

441
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,609
(thunder rumbling )

442
00:40:00,023 --> 00:40:01,366
( exhales )

443
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:25,223
- Hola.
- Hola.

444
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:28,726
- Michael.
- Calvo.

445
00:40:28,885 --> 00:40:32,059
( both speaking Spanish )

446
00:40:32,222 --> 00:40:34,691
( chuckles, speaks Spanish )

447
00:40:39,062 --> 00:40:41,736
- What did he say?
- We're gonna show him.

448
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:07,640
Here, give me the phone.

449
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:10,427
Calvo.
( speaks Spanish )

450
00:41:13,513 --> 00:41:15,936
( speaks Spanish )

451
00:41:39,956 --> 00:41:41,503
- What did he just ask?
- He asked...

452
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:44,294
Why were you and your friend
not together?

453
00:41:46,129 --> 00:41:47,472
We got separated.

454
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:50,304
Separated?
How did you get separated?

455
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:52,810
It was stupid.
We got in a fight.

456
00:41:52,969 --> 00:41:54,471
Oh.

457
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:57,561
Well, I am sure she will forgive you.

458
00:41:57,724 --> 00:41:59,772
Wait, where are you going?

459
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:01,231
Your friend is fine.

460
00:42:01,394 --> 00:42:05,115
When she realizes she has lost her
phone she will come back to find it.

461
00:42:05,273 --> 00:42:07,321
Senor, please wait.
Where are you going?

462
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:09,656
Calvo.

463
00:42:09,819 --> 00:42:11,412
Michael.

464
00:42:11,571 --> 00:42:14,415
( speaking Spanish )

465
00:42:15,575 --> 00:42:18,499
Do yourself a favor
and find another lover.

466
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:21,665
This one has a habit
of losing his girlfriends.

467
00:42:24,834 --> 00:42:28,008
Hey. Hey!

468
00:42:28,171 --> 00:42:31,425
I am very sorry, but I...

469
00:42:31,591 --> 00:42:33,593
She was with a guy last night.

470
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,013
What did he look like?

471
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:38,273
He was tall.

472
00:42:38,431 --> 00:42:40,354
He had brown hair.

473
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:42,655
Brown hair?

474
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:46,189
You just described half
of Argentina.

475
00:42:46,356 --> 00:42:48,859
- Did you get his name?
- No, I didn't.

476
00:42:49,025 --> 00:42:51,995
- Could you identify him?
- Yeah.

477
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:55,123
Yeah, if I saw him again
I'm sure I could.

478
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:57,704
Well, when you do see him
you can call me,

479
00:42:57,867 --> 00:42:59,995
but now there is nothing I can do.

480
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:04,336
Please. Please.

481
00:43:04,499 --> 00:43:06,593
Okay.

482
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:08,549
You may make a report if you want.

483
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:11,260
Yeah, that...
thank you.

484
00:43:13,049 --> 00:43:15,222
Can I ride with you?

485
00:43:17,053 --> 00:43:19,226
- Of course.
- Okay.

486
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:22,142
You want me to come with you?

487
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:23,776
No, Michael.
Thank you.

488
00:43:23,935 --> 00:43:26,734
I think I can handle
the situation from here.

489
00:43:26,896 --> 00:43:28,819
Yeah, I'll be fine.

490
00:43:28,982 --> 00:43:31,235
( opens door)

491
00:43:33,778 --> 00:43:35,405
( closes door)

492
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:07,195
Just because he speaks English
does not mean you should trust him.

493
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:10,614
I don't know if I trust
anybody right now.

494
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:26,463
(tapping )

495
00:44:29,959 --> 00:44:32,303
( Calvo speaking Spanish )

496
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:51,651
All done.

497
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:53,942
Wait, that's it?

498
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:56,531
- That's it.
- No.

499
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:59,038
We should be out there
looking for her.

500
00:44:59,197 --> 00:45:01,666
I mean, we can still make
a search party before it gets dark.

501
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:03,497
A search party?

502
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:07,004
Where do you think you are?
This is not America.

503
00:45:07,163 --> 00:45:10,383
Does it look like I can
make a search party?

504
00:45:12,168 --> 00:45:14,170
Then what else can we do?

505
00:45:14,337 --> 00:45:17,511
Today? Nothing.

506
00:45:17,673 --> 00:45:19,061
Nothing?

507
00:45:19,217 --> 00:45:23,643
Please, you should not
worry so much.

508
00:45:23,805 --> 00:45:25,853
Your friend is just having her fun.

509
00:45:26,015 --> 00:45:28,313
My friend is not out there
having fun, okay?

510
00:45:28,476 --> 00:45:30,854
I know her.

511
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:33,523
She wouldn't just leave me like this.

512
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:37,159
The way you left her alone
in a foreign country?

513
00:45:42,073 --> 00:45:43,666
I'm sorry.

514
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:48,250
I will do everything in my power.

515
00:45:48,413 --> 00:45:50,211
You have my word.

516
00:45:50,373 --> 00:45:53,047
This is so messed up.

517
00:45:55,044 --> 00:45:57,046
Is there someone else I can talk to?

518
00:45:57,213 --> 00:45:59,841
( chuckles )
You're tired.

519
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:03,602
Why don't you go back to the hotel
and take a siesta?

520
00:46:05,221 --> 00:46:08,395
You want me to take a nap
while my best friend is missing?

521
00:46:08,558 --> 00:46:12,108
Yes.
I think you will feel much better.

522
00:46:14,355 --> 00:46:17,484
It's okay.
Look, if she's not back tomorrow,

523
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:20,995
we'll file a missing persons report
with federal police in Buenos Aires.

524
00:46:21,154 --> 00:46:22,576
Okay?

525
00:46:25,408 --> 00:46:26,910
Okay.

526
00:46:27,076 --> 00:46:28,919
Good.

527
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:46,103
Everything will be all right.
You'll see.

528
00:47:16,209 --> 00:47:19,179
Disculpe me.

529
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:23,845
Uh...

530
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:26,970
I'm looking for my friend.

531
00:47:27,136 --> 00:47:29,855
Senora.
I'm just looking for my friend.

532
00:47:30,014 --> 00:47:32,938
- Mi amiga. Senora?
- ( door slams )

533
00:47:56,749 --> 00:47:59,343
Oh, excuse me.
Can you help me?

534
00:47:59,502 --> 00:48:02,176
I'm looking for my friend.
I can't find her.

535
00:48:02,338 --> 00:48:05,342
Senora?
I just want to ask...

536
00:48:05,508 --> 00:48:07,510
- ( door slams )
- I just...

537
00:48:08,803 --> 00:48:10,476
( sighs )

538
00:48:11,764 --> 00:48:14,893
Senora, please.

539
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:22,192
Hey, wait.

540
00:48:22,358 --> 00:48:23,735
Hey!

541
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:26,245
I just want to talk to you.

542
00:48:43,045 --> 00:48:44,513
Wait.

543
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:49,343
Hey!

544
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,008
Ellie?

545
00:50:27,942 --> 00:50:29,865
( knocks )

546
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:31,904
Hello?

547
00:50:32,071 --> 00:50:33,994
- ( knocks )
- Michael?

548
00:50:57,138 --> 00:50:59,482
( speaks Spanish )

549
00:51:09,859 --> 00:51:12,738
I'm sorry.
I've got to go.

550
00:51:13,863 --> 00:51:15,536
( speaking Spanish )

551
00:51:19,285 --> 00:51:21,708
Look what I found.
It was in his room.

552
00:51:21,871 --> 00:51:23,873
- It's Ellie's.
- Whose room?

553
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:25,211
Michael's.

554
00:51:27,543 --> 00:51:30,513
Okay.
( speaks Spanish )

555
00:51:30,671 --> 00:51:32,048
I will question him,

556
00:51:32,214 --> 00:51:35,309
but only if you go
back to the hotel and wait for me.

557
00:51:35,468 --> 00:51:38,597
You let me do my job.
Is that fair?

558
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:46,399
- Okay.
- Good.

559
00:52:03,913 --> 00:52:05,915
What's wrong?

560
00:52:07,416 --> 00:52:08,838
Ellie's gone.

561
00:52:09,001 --> 00:52:10,719
Gone?

562
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:16,100
We got in a fight
and I went on without her.

563
00:52:21,806 --> 00:52:24,104
I've got to--
I've got to find her.

564
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:27,395
Come inside.
Have something to drink.

565
00:52:31,065 --> 00:52:33,193
Come on.
it's okay.

566
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:35,077
Come on.

567
00:52:41,784 --> 00:52:44,207
( door opens )

568
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:45,997
( ticking )

569
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:48,257
(thumping )

570
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:05,524
Rosamaria: Don't worry.
Everything will be fine.

571
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:39,636
( crystals clinking )

572
00:55:39,795 --> 00:55:42,469
(wind blowing )

573
00:56:51,533 --> 00:56:52,750
Hey'

574
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:54,127
- Please don't! No!
- Just wait!

575
00:56:54,286 --> 00:56:56,709
- No, let me go!
- Hey! I won't hurt you.

576
00:56:56,872 --> 00:56:58,920
- Hey. Hey.
- Stop, no! Stop it!

577
00:56:59,083 --> 00:57:01,427
- Get off me!
- I'm not gonna hurt you.

578
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:05,221
What's the matter with you?

579
00:57:11,428 --> 00:57:13,772
Where did you get this?

580
00:57:13,931 --> 00:57:15,808
You went through my things?

581
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:18,648
Where did you get this?

582
00:57:18,811 --> 00:57:20,688
Look, it belongs to someone I know.

583
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:22,948
Bullshit!
This is Ellie's.

584
00:57:24,358 --> 00:57:25,951
What did you do with her?

585
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:30,832
Look, I swear to God I've got nothing
to do with your friend, okay?

586
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:32,662
You have to trust me.
Look.

587
00:57:32,825 --> 00:57:35,453
Look, please.
Would you just take a look at this?

588
00:57:35,619 --> 00:57:38,088
Okay?
Just take a look at it.

589
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:47,976
Her name is Camila.

590
00:57:48,132 --> 00:57:50,351
She disappeared
somewhere around here.

591
00:57:50,509 --> 00:57:54,184
That's her bracelet.

592
00:57:55,931 --> 00:57:59,981
I've been up and down these roads
100 times looking for her.

593
00:58:03,147 --> 00:58:05,115
Oh God.

594
00:58:07,985 --> 00:58:09,578
I'm so sorry.

595
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:14,454
I'm sorry.

596
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:17,953
You know, when we met
she was organizing

597
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:20,839
a humanitarian mission
to South America.

598
00:58:20,998 --> 00:58:25,799
And I wanted to be with her
so I went too.

599
00:58:25,961 --> 00:58:28,339
What happened?

600
00:58:31,216 --> 00:58:33,935
About six months ago
we came to work here.

601
00:58:34,094 --> 00:58:37,394
One day she took the truck
into town to get some supplies

602
00:58:37,556 --> 00:58:40,184
and that's the last I saw of her.

603
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:42,068
Nobody knows what happened.

604
00:58:42,227 --> 00:58:45,071
And if they do,
they're not saying anything.

605
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:47,904
I'd do anything to get her back.

606
00:58:49,443 --> 00:58:51,866
And I'm not leaving this country
until I find her.

607
00:58:52,029 --> 00:58:54,828
Did you call the police?

608
00:58:54,990 --> 00:58:56,833
Calvo?

609
00:58:56,992 --> 00:58:59,666
Yeah, he filled out a form.

610
00:58:59,828 --> 00:59:01,751
Oh no.

611
00:59:01,914 --> 00:59:03,837
God.

612
00:59:03,999 --> 00:59:07,253
I'm gonna be sick.

613
00:59:10,756 --> 00:59:13,179
Oh God.

614
00:59:15,594 --> 00:59:17,471
I can't--

615
00:59:17,638 --> 00:59:19,857
Look, I've been hearing things

616
00:59:20,015 --> 00:59:22,985
about young women, girls,
who've been abducted

617
00:59:23,143 --> 00:59:25,441
and taken across the river
into Paraguay.

618
00:59:25,604 --> 00:59:28,483
I don't know if that's what's
happened to your friend.

619
00:59:28,649 --> 00:59:31,368
I mean, it's rare.
it's risky to kidnap an American.

620
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:33,620
But it does happen.

621
00:59:33,779 --> 00:59:35,656
That's why I tried to warn her.

622
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:37,665
Oh.

623
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:39,667
I have to find her.

624
00:59:39,826 --> 00:59:41,214
I have to find Ellie.

625
00:59:41,370 --> 00:59:42,963
Okay.

626
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:45,465
Well, I mean, chances are
she's probably still in the area.

627
00:59:45,624 --> 00:59:47,752
It's too risky to move her
during daylight.

628
00:59:47,918 --> 00:59:50,341
But we need to find her
before it gets dark.

629
00:59:50,504 --> 00:59:53,633
- How?
- We need to split up.

630
00:59:53,799 --> 00:59:55,676
Now I'll understand if you
don't want to do that.

631
00:59:55,842 --> 00:59:57,765
But we can cover more ground
if you do.

632
00:59:59,263 --> 01:00:02,608
No, you're right.
You're right.

633
01:00:02,766 --> 01:00:05,940
Okay, I'll meet you back here
in an hour.

634
01:00:06,103 --> 01:00:07,571
Yeah.

635
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:24,914
( chandeliers clinking )

636
01:00:34,131 --> 01:00:36,725
( birds squawking )

637
01:00:57,904 --> 01:01:00,248
Ellie!

638
01:01:01,241 --> 01:01:03,494
Ellie!

639
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:07,206
Ellie!

640
01:01:10,709 --> 01:01:11,710
Ellie!

641
01:01:11,877 --> 01:01:14,005
( man speaking Spanish on TV)

642
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:22,521
( coughs )

643
01:01:33,148 --> 01:01:35,492
( coughs )

644
01:02:10,852 --> 01:02:13,526
- ( car door opens, closes )
- Oh shit.

645
01:02:17,859 --> 01:02:21,955
Michael, you're becoming
a hard man to find.

646
01:02:22,114 --> 01:02:25,084
Surely you must be lost.

647
01:02:25,242 --> 01:02:28,086
You know me,
just seeing the sights.

648
01:02:28,245 --> 01:02:29,918
Yes, of course you are.

649
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:32,174
Have you seen Stephanie?

650
01:02:32,332 --> 01:02:34,130
No.

651
01:02:34,292 --> 01:02:36,556
Because a car has been stolen

652
01:02:36,711 --> 01:02:39,260
and that does not happen
very often around here.

653
01:02:39,423 --> 01:02:42,051
Wow.
A stolen car.

654
01:02:44,219 --> 01:02:46,221
Did you find Stephanie's friend?

655
01:02:46,388 --> 01:02:49,392
I was going to ask you
the same thing.

656
01:02:51,393 --> 01:02:54,112
So her friend is still missing

657
01:02:54,271 --> 01:02:57,115
and you're looking for a car?

658
01:02:57,274 --> 01:02:59,072
( chuckles )

659
01:03:01,570 --> 01:03:03,447
Okay.

660
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:06,366
Come with me.

Chucho,

668
01:04:21,775 --> 01:04:24,995
I know you're not a bad guy.

669
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:30,334
I can tell by the way
you kissed me.

670

Ellie:
Oh God, get me out of here, please.

693
01:06:37,118 --> 01:06:41,214
Well, seems that tonight is your night.

01:06:59,516 --> 01:07:00,984
Listen.

- Ellie, come on. Hurry hurry.
- Go, go.

715
01:09:16,361 --> 01:09:17,658
Lock it! Lock it!

716
01:09:19,447 --> 01:09:21,950

Ellie, please.

746
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:54,042
Ellie.

747
01:10:54,208 --> 01:10:56,711
- Stephanie: She's dead!
- ( speaking Spanish )

(Crying )

751
01:11:08,556 --> 01:11:11,105
Stephanie, is this the man

752
01:11:11,267 --> 01:11:12,564
you say was with your friend
the other night?

753
01:11:12,727 --> 01:11:16,072
- Yes!
- Stephanie, get into the truck.

754
01:11:18,441 --> 01:11:20,739
It's for your safety.
Trust me.

755
01:11:20,902 --> 01:11:22,904
Now!

756
01:11:23,905 --> 01:11:25,748
Oh my God.

757
01:11:29,702 --> 01:11:33,297
( grunts, coughs )

758
01:11:41,255 --> 01:11:43,007
She was very desirable.

759
01:11:43,174 --> 01:11:44,926
What a waste.

760
01:11:52,767 --> 01:11:54,610
"Assport"?
Clever.

761
01:11:54,769 --> 01:11:56,021
That's a good one.

762
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:06,081
Michael!
it's him, Michael!

763
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:09,368
- Michael!
- But that one

764
01:12:09,534 --> 01:12:12,959
will do fine in her place,
don't you think?

765
01:12:17,083 --> 01:12:18,460
( speaks Spanish )

766
01:12:20,211 --> 01:12:22,259
- Michael.
- Shut up.

767
01:12:22,422 --> 01:12:25,642
Get away from the car.
Where is she?

768
01:12:29,053 --> 01:12:31,476
- Calvo: Just put the gun down.
- ( gunshot )

769
01:12:31,639 --> 01:12:33,312
Where's Camila?

770
01:12:33,474 --> 01:12:35,772
Michael, we can still
help each other.

771
01:12:35,935 --> 01:12:38,859
- But you must put the gun down.
- On your knees.

772
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:44,994
( speaks Spanish )

773
01:12:45,153 --> 01:12:47,531
Shut up!
On your knees.

774
01:12:53,953 --> 01:12:55,580
Think for a second.

775
01:12:55,747 --> 01:12:59,672
If you kill me then who will tell you
where to find Camila?

776
01:13:05,006 --> 01:13:07,976
Just put the gun down
and let's talk, okay? Man to man.

777
01:13:08,134 --> 01:13:11,354
I think we can work out something
that will satisfy us both.

778
01:13:11,512 --> 01:13:14,186
- Where is she?
- She's safe. Trust me.

779
01:13:14,348 --> 01:13:16,521
- ( gunshot )
- Where is she?

780
01:13:20,855 --> 01:13:24,359
I swear to you no harm
has come to her.

781
01:13:26,486 --> 01:13:28,739
Okay.

782
01:13:28,905 --> 01:13:33,160
I can bring her to you,
but we must trade.

783
01:13:34,911 --> 01:13:36,538
You piece of shit.

784
01:13:36,704 --> 01:13:38,547
( speaks Spanish )

785
01:13:38,706 --> 01:13:41,209
This is the only way.

786
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:44,379
Stephanie for Camila.

787
01:13:55,556 --> 01:13:57,433
It's simple, Michael.

788
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:00,695
Stephanie for Camila.

789
01:14:17,078 --> 01:14:18,421
No.

790
01:14:20,706 --> 01:14:23,676
I'm sorry.

791
01:14:23,835 --> 01:14:25,633
- Michael, no!
- ( gunshot)

792
01:14:55,741 --> 01:14:57,618
( Calvo speaks Spanish )

793
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:02,423
( groans )

794
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:09,301
I hope you're going
to be a good girl

795
01:15:09,463 --> 01:15:12,091
and play nice.

796
01:15:12,258 --> 01:15:13,931
'Cause if you give me any trouble,

797
01:15:14,093 --> 01:15:17,518
I swear I will cut you so bad

798
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:21,901
you will not even make $10 per day
sucking cock in the streets.

799
01:15:26,564 --> 01:15:28,032
Please.

800
01:15:30,526 --> 01:15:34,702
What if I told you that you
are only worth $2,000?

801
01:15:34,864 --> 01:15:37,617
$6,000 if you're a virgin, but--

802
01:15:41,495 --> 01:15:42,758
are you a virgin?

803
01:15:45,625 --> 01:15:47,502
Get away!
Stop it!

804
01:15:47,668 --> 01:15:51,514
Stop. No.
No, I don't think you're a virgin.

805
01:16:01,098 --> 01:16:02,816
Please.
I'm sorry.

806
01:16:02,975 --> 01:16:05,398
Don't worry, you're American,

807
01:16:05,561 --> 01:16:07,188
not some brown peasant.

808
01:16:07,355 --> 01:16:09,949
You're worth much more.

809
01:16:10,107 --> 01:16:11,859
( crackles )

810
01:16:17,698 --> 01:16:19,371
( phone ringing )

811
01:16:26,290 --> 01:16:29,089
( speaking Spanish )

812
01:16:41,597 --> 01:16:45,147
It's lucky for you my partner
across the river is open-minded.

813
01:16:45,309 --> 01:16:48,062
You see, he is a businessman too.

814
01:16:48,229 --> 01:16:51,449
And they think you could
make a nice accessory

815
01:16:51,607 --> 01:16:53,405
for one of his clients.

816
01:16:54,694 --> 01:16:57,117
( muffled screaming )

817
01:17:00,157 --> 01:17:01,704
Night night.

818
01:17:42,950 --> 01:17:44,952
( groans )

819
01:18:29,538 --> 01:18:31,927

( coughing, gasping )

826
01:20:19,940 --> 01:20:21,988
- ( screams )
- Get up.

827
01:20:22,151 --> 01:20:23,994
I should kill you.

828
01:20:24,153 --> 01:20:26,281
Then you would owe me
a lot of money.

829
01:20:26,447 --> 01:20:27,790
Pick her up.

830
01:20:31,452 --> 01:20:33,375
( panting )

831
01:20:33,537 --> 01:20:35,960
- I don't like this.
- What's not to like?

832
01:20:36,123 --> 01:20:38,376
- This is what we discussed.
- This is dangerous.

833
01:20:38,542 --> 01:20:41,637
Girls like her--
people will look for her.

834
01:20:41,795 --> 01:20:43,672
Then put her someplace
no one will find her.

835
01:20:43,839 --> 01:20:46,513
So easy for you.

836

Please.
Please.

837
01:20:52,139 --> 01:20:54,983
Your greed is going
to get you killed one day.

838
01:20:55,142 --> 01:20:56,735
And you,

839
01:20:56,894 --> 01:20:59,864
you'd better be worth the trouble.

840
01:21:00,022 --> 01:21:02,320
- Never!

841

(grunts)

857
01:24:34,695 --> 01:24:38,199
Stephanie, please.
Give me the gun.

858
01:24:40,701 --> 01:24:44,205
Come on.
Be a good girl.

859
01:24:44,371 --> 01:24:47,375
Just give me the gun!

860
