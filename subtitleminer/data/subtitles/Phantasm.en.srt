( Sighs ) Tommy's gone.

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,440
It's, uh...
it's a hell of a way to end a trio.

17
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,360
It's hard to believe.

18

Killed himself.

I'm gonna go visit somebody. Uh...

It was a good idea not to let
your brother come to the funeral

34
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,800
and see Tommy like this.

35
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,560
Yeah, after Mom and Dad's funeral,
he had nightmares for weeks.

Hi. Is your grandmother home?

44
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,280
Sure, come in.

45
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,440
Grandmother, Michael has returned
and wishes to speak with you.

46
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,680
Grandmother is pleased you've come
and wants to know what's bothering you.

47
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,920
Uh, tell her that I, um...

48
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,360
She can hear you.

49
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,800

- Hey!

00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,960
- So what brings you back?
- Tommy.

56
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,360
Yeah...yeah, shoot.

57
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,560
I just don't get off on funerals, man.
They give me the creeps.

58
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,000
I just wanna tell you
I heard about you folks. I'm sorry.

59
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,920
Yeah, thank you, man.

60
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,440
In two years I guess you can
just about get over anything.

61
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,800
- So, I hear you've been out on the road.
- Yeah.

62
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,800
How come you're hanging
around this dump?

63
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,920
Well, I'm taking care of the kid.

64
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:22,960
Shit, I'd think after all that action,
this town'd drive you nuts.

65
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,800
You're damn right.

66
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,600
Now the kid's 13, I'm thinking
of sending him off to live with his aunt,

67
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,800
but I'll tell you, he ain't gonna like it.

68
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,480
As it is, he follows me everywhere,
it's like he knows I'm gonna leave.

69
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,880
He's a tough little kid. I love him.

70
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,160
I'm gonna miss him.

71
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,800
Grandmother says not to worry.
If he does leave, he'll take you with him.

72
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,880
- God, I hope she's right.
- She always is.

73
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:05,360
There's somethin' else.
I'm really scared about something I did.

74
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,000
I was messing around up at Morningside
Cemetery and I saw something...

75
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,960
something really scary.

Michael,
Grandmother wants to play a little game.

79
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,080
Wow! How did you do that?

80
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,920
Put your hand in the box.

81
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:16,840
- What's in it?
- Just put your hand in the black box.

82
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
OK, but what's in it?

83
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,560
- Hey, this thing really hurts!
- Don't fear, Michael.

84
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,280
- I can't get my hand out!
- Don't fear.

85
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,760
- Gimme back my hand!
- Don't fear!

86
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:44,000
It was simply a reflection.
Fear is the killer.

87
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:47,040
That's what Grandmother
wants you to learn.

88
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,000
Boy, that really hurt.

89
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,120
It was all in your mind.

00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,920
Um, yeah.

91
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,440
Come and visit us again soon.

You won't believe this, but these things
were here and they were gonna get me!

00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,360
Ah, gimme a break, will you?

170
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:51,960

making these weird sounds.

171
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,600
Sure it wasn't that retarded kid, Timmy?

172

No, it was the same thing
that chased me last night!

173

Well, what are we gonna do?

Well, there's somethin' I didn't tell you.

200
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,800
I was spying on Tommy's funeral
from the groves.

201
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:55,040
After everybody left, that tall man
picked up Tommy's coffin all by himself,

202
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,400
- put it in the hearse, and drove off.
- You're crazy.

203
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:03,200

But I do know one thing.
Something weird is going on up there.

207
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,120
We're going for the sheriff.
Go get your...evidence.

208
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,160
All right!

Hi, guys.

221

Thought I'd come and see what was goin'
on before the kids got outta summer school.

Mike, you wanna ride along with me today?

223
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:12,600
It's pretty warm outside
and the ice cream'll be flyin' fast and furious.

224
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:15,600
Remember how good you were
at crowd control last time...

225
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,440
Hey, what's goin' on here?

226
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,920
( Buzzing )

227
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:19,670
Ah!

228
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,280
- Ah!
- ( Buzzing )

00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:48,280
What the hell is goin' on?

231
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,680
Here, you keep that.

232
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:55,960
Now remember, you don't aim a gun
at a man unless you intend to shoot him,

233
00:41:55,960 --> 00:42:00,280
and you don't shoot a man
unless you intend to kill him.

234
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,720
No warning shots.

235
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,640
Hey, you listen' to me?

236
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,080
- Yeah.
- No warning shots.

237
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:10,360
Warning shots are bullshit.
You shoot to kill, or you don't shoot at all.

238
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:13,720
Now, you'll be safe here.
Just lock all the doors and windows.

239
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,600
And don't follow me.

240
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,520
You sure you're gonna be OK with that?

241
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:22,840
I'm just gonna go up there and take
a look around. Nobody's gonna see me.

242
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:27,800
But heck, a Colt army issue
will put a man down, and keep him there.

243
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:36,920
Remember that broken basement window
around by the side...and be careful.

OK, slow down
and let him ride right up on our ass.

258
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,960
There was nobody...
there was nobody driving!

259
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,720
I'm gonna get that bastard!

260
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:19,840
Oh, Jesus!

261
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:29,880

You didn't tell me the dwarf was Tommy.

273
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,360
Hell, we buried him on Monday
and look what they did to him.

274
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:25,680
He's only three feet long,
he must still weigh 200 pounds.

275
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:30,440
What's all this yellow shit
comin' out of his head?

276
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:32,360
Careful, get him in there.

277
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:36,200
- Better padlock it.
- Yeah.

278

Hey, this guy's not gonna leak
all over my ice cream, is he?

279
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:47,240
Nah. I'll see you back at the house.

280
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:50,360
Right.

281
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:26,520
Hey, you boys back again?

282
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:32,720
Jesus Christ, Myrtle,
you almost gave me a coronary!

283
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:35,120
But I just can't figure out why.

284
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:42,280
Why they're taking these bodies
and crushing 'em down to half size.

285
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:43,720
Crushing 'em!

286

What about Mom and Dad?
They're up there too.

OK...I see it, I see it all now.

289
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:12,240
What we gotta do is snag that tall dude
and stomp the shit out of him,

290
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:15,600
and we'll find out what the hell
is goin' on up there.

291
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:20,240
We'll lay that sucker flat and drive
a stake right through his goddamn heart!

You gotta be shittin' me, man,
that mother's strong!

00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:28,840
Hey, hold on.
First thing is, I want Mike outta here.

294
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:33,160
Reg, you take him over to Sally's,
the antique store.

295
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:38,280
He'll be safe there. Then hustle on back.
And Mike, no arguments.

I hope he's feeling OK.

I've got a bed made up for you in back.

You have to take me home.

- Hey, man, I don't know.

370

I've been hiding in a casket
playin' like a stiff, but I did find the girls.

371
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:38,520
I found Sally and Sue, and a couple
of other girls I never even saw before.

372
01:06:38,520 --> 01:06:40,560
Were they dead?

373
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:46,320
No. I snuck 'em out a window and they took
off through the bushes like scared rabbits.

374
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:48,240
All right.

Slaves!

The dwarfs.

391

And they gotta crush 'em...
cos of the gravity...and the heat.

there's an old mine shft, way down
by...by the end of Singer's Creek.

A thousand feet straight down.

to get him up there.

around the mine shaft and camouflage it.
