00:01:57,817 --> 00:02:01,446
She wouldn't tell me her husband's name.
She wouldn't even write it.

2
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:05,715
She knows not to speak
the names of the dead.

3
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:10,623
Zuwanie's murdered half the town.
How could it get any worse?

4
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:13,890
With Zuwanie, he could murder
the other half.

5
00:02:33,953 --> 00:02:37,286
No. Just us, they said.

6
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:41,290
Xola's right, Philippe.

7
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:44,793
You've done well, my friend, but just us.

8
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:15,624
I'll do the talking.

9
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:32,567
They're Ku.

10
00:04:55,528 --> 00:04:58,292
It's OK. It's OK.

11
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:16,875
The Teacher says good day to you.

12
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:06,595
<i>The United Nations was born in a hope
that survived world war...</i>

13
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:17,876
<i>We must not allow the peace
of the world to be jeopardized.</i>

14
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:27,180
<i>Not only is this a negation
of democracy and its principles,</i>

15
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:32,357
<i>it constitutes interference
in the internal affairs of sovereign states.</i>

16
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:40,892
We are presently in the throes
of a great transition

17
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:43,568
in humankind's affairs.

18
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:47,204
Modern technology is altering our world

19
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,877
in ways that would have been
impossible to fathom

20
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:55,444
when the United Nations Charter was signed.

21
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:58,411
- Could you take your jacket off?
- Go ahead.

22
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:02,716
- Next.
- Ma'am?

23
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:04,582
What?

24
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:07,918
- Put it in the drawer, please.
- Step forward, please.

25
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:10,220
- Step through.
- Oh, man.

26
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:15,623
Peace, security and freedom

27
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:21,101
are not finite commodities
like land, oil or gold,

28
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:25,436
which one state can acquire
at another's expense.

29
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,287
Get the GA President into the safe room.
Inform him.

30
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:41,482
Clear out the tourists,
get the Prime Minister on his way out.

31
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:49,892
While globalization has benefited
portions of the world...

32
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:55,272
While there are now 191 nations represented,

33
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:58,341
140 more than there were in 1945,

34
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:03,515
you'll only have to learn to say "peace"
in the six languages of the General Assembly.

35
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:06,718
- Do we get a pin?
- Folks, you need to follow me.

36
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:11,184
Ladies and gentlemen,
we need to take a 15-minute recess now.

37
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:14,484
We will advise you further
at the end of that time.

38
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:21,824
We can't use the stairs.

39
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:25,003
- I know a short-cut.
- What, did you design the building?

40
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:27,331
- I still get lost every other day.
- Silvia?

41
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:31,233
I'll be right back.

42
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:37,710
- What is that?
- Come on, Roland, it's my flutes and stuff.

43
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:40,851
I have a lesson tonight. Don't make me
drag it down just to drag it back up.

44
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:44,648
I let you do this,
I'll get coats and hats and yogi mats...

45
00:08:58,337 --> 00:09:00,931
I had a beauty. "Pie in the sky".

46
00:09:01,173 --> 00:09:04,973
<i>- Isn't it like "castles in Spain"?
- Exactly. Les chateaux en Espagne.</i>

47
00:09:09,448 --> 00:09:13,544
Stay away from both doors.
We'll unlock when it's all clear, sir.

48
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:18,485
Delegates' entrance clear.

49
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:22,422
Delegates' lounge clear.

50
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:31,300
Visitors' lobby clear.

51
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:42,407
Protectee is back in America.

52
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:46,781
Want to wait this out at Oz?
We can grab a sandwich.

53
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:52,514
<i>- I've got to get back in to get my stuff.
- Merde, how long is this going to take?</i>

54
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:17,661
<i>Hey, you got the Kellers. We're out
having a good time, so leave a message.</i>

55
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:33,249
<i>Hey, you got the Kellers. We're out
having a good time, so leave a message.</i>

56
00:12:57,076 --> 00:13:00,944
<i>Silvia? Rudy thought he had
a flute lesson tonight.</i>

57
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,580
<i>Will you call me when you get in?</i>

58
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:34,369
- You know, they make new ones now.
- Yeah, I know.

59
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:40,045
Portuguese.

60
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:54,054
<i>Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen,</i>

61
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:57,694
<i>the situation in Matobo
has now become critical.</i>

62
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:02,731
<i>With Ajene Xola in hiding
and Kuman-Kuman in exile,</i>

63
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:06,870
<i>Edmond Zuwanie has few domestic obstacles</i>

64
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:09,597
to his policy of ethnic cleansing.

65
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:14,711
<i>The Security Council therefore
must press for his immediate referral</i>

66
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:19,407
<i>to the International Criminal Court
in The Hague.</i>

67
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:24,211
Miss Broome.

68
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:28,153
I'm Jonathan Williams, Ambassador Harris's
adviser. We need you for a few minutes.

69
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:35,932
- Which language?
- The Matoban ambassador. He'll speak Ku.

70
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:38,693
- Ku?
- You speak the language, don't you?

71
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:49,677
Let's be clear, Mr. Ambassador.

72
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:53,942
The United States may not recognize the ICC
as a legitimate court,

73
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:59,590
but we do not condone the methods President
Zuwanie uses against his own people.

74
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:06,189
Dr. Zuwanie is an educator.

75
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:10,334
He is... our teacher.

76
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:15,900
But his opponents
engage in ever more ferocious acts.

77
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:21,670
The partisans of both Kuman-Kuman
and Ajene Xola have become...

78
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,180
terrorists.

79
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:31,389
The French proposal
is a diplomatic headache for both of us.

80
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,824
- What a predicament.
- It doesn't have to be.

81
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:41,931
Dr. Zuwanie wouldn't have to appear
before the International Criminal Court.

82
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:45,102
Not if he were somewhere else.

83
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:50,670
- Do you want him to resign?
- Tell him this.

84
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:56,904
If he goes voluntarily, we're confident
the French proposal will be vetoed.

85
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:01,712
You can tell him yourself.

86
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:04,714
He will be here next Friday,

87
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:08,723
exercising his right
to speak before the General Assembly,

88
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:12,727
where he will announce
a new programme of democratic reform.

89
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:17,664
Perhaps then there will be no vote
and your predicament will disappear.

90
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:25,970
<i>It will end here.</i>

91
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:30,211
The Teacher will never leave
this room alive.

92
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:34,408
That's it. "The Teacher will never
leave this room alive. "

93
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:35,881
Word for word.

94
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:40,251
- And what language did you say?
- Ku.

95
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:44,724
It's a tribal dialect of Matoban, spoken
throughout the south central African belt.

96
00:17:44,963 --> 00:17:48,990
- Did you see anyone?
- No, but I think that they saw me.

97
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:52,328
Why didn't you report this last night?

98
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:56,500
It didn't mean anything to me at the time.

99
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:00,568
- Rather, I didn't know what it meant.
- But now you do.

100
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:02,746
I heard something today.

101
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:06,812
I don't know if I'm permitted.

102
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,951
- It was in a closed...
- You are.

103
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:13,124
In fact, you're obligated,
as you were last night when you didn't.

104
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:19,461
I think they were talking
about Edmond Zuwanie.

105
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:23,657
He's planning to come here
to address the GA.

106
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:26,828
Can you see her?

107
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:31,434
Turn on the light.

108
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:40,849
Call the Secret Service.

109
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:54,426
Bet you really miss this. Welcome back.

110
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:58,033
Ma'am? Excuse me.
Please don't touch the Prime Minister.

111
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:02,263
I need you to step back, please.

112
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:04,576
Woods.

113
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:11,381
The first of the demonstrators.

114
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:16,179
They're here to protest the appearance
later this week by Edmond Zuwanie.

115
00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:19,254
Not just his political future
but any future for him

116
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:22,051
hinges on that speech
to the General Assembly.

117
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:24,694
Dr. Zuwanie is accused of genocide,

118
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:29,264
but he's expected to argue that his actions
were a defensive response to terrorism

119
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:34,495
and not acts of aggression, as some
Security Council members have charged.

120
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,368
- Secret Service.
- Just a moment, please.

121
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:40,806
We're with Foreign Dignitary Protection.

122
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:45,305
- It's a branch of the US government.
- Dot.

123
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:49,180
This is international territory.
I need you to wait for an escort.

124
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:51,150
<i>Zuwanie lands at 8.45 hours.</i>

125
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:54,985
<i>State Department says no meet-and-greet,
no shopping, no Lion King.</i>

126
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:59,664
He leaves your podium, his plane
has two hours to clear US airspace,

127
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:01,729
unless the UN cancels the visit

128
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:05,926
and Tobin and I can get back to the really
important work that we were doing this morning.

129
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:10,198
That's up to the GA President.
We just present a threat assessment.

130
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:13,036
- Why is he coming in the first place?
- To make a speech.

131
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:15,712
He's trying to avoid being brought
before the International Criminal Court.

132
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:20,783
Security Council was debating whether
to bring charges of ethnic cleansing,

133
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:24,386
so he'll come, talk about free elections
and democratic reform

134
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:27,387
and pray that that appeases everyone.

135
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:30,595
So the stakes are high for him.
He's not going to cancel.

136
00:20:32,097 --> 00:20:34,361
Tell me about the interpreter.

137
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:40,333
Born here, but lived mostly
in Africa and Europe.

138
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:42,563
She studied music in Johannesburg

139
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:46,744
and linguistics at the Sorbonne
and various countries in Europe.

140
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:48,105
Parents?

141
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:52,807
<i>British mother, white African father.
Moved here five years ago.</i>

142
00:20:53,051 --> 00:20:55,918
Interview couldn't have taken long.
She's just what they want.

143
00:20:56,154 --> 00:20:59,089
- She is the UN.
- Can she cook?

144
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:02,987
What else do we know?
Since the initial clearance.

145
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,661
Is she married?

146
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:08,593
<i>Does she have a child?
Does she belong to any clubs?</i>

147
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:11,098
Is she registered to vote?

148
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:14,931
<i>Democrat? Republican?</i>

149
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:18,235
<i>What religion is she?</i>

150
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:21,607
Who is she?

151
00:21:22,514 --> 00:21:24,675
Silvia.

152
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:40,528
Secret Service Dignitary Protection Squad.

153
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:44,133
We're responsible for 
visiting heads of state.

154
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:49,636
- I don't recall seeing you around.
- They hire us for our forgettable faces.

155
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:56,370
- Is she on guard?
- Yes, ma'am.

156
00:21:56,615 --> 00:22:01,814
Ma'am. Why is it you guys who carry guns
always sound like cowboys?

157
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:07,818
I don't concentrate on faces in my job.

158
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,153
But you listen to voices.

159
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:14,027
Do you think you could identify the voice?

160
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:18,362
Well, I'd say yes, if it were...
It was almost a whisper.

161
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:22,399
Whispers disguise the quality of a voice.

162
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:26,339
You, I imagine, study faces.

163
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:37,017
- You know, I'm not really a dignitary.
- I know.

164
00:22:41,426 --> 00:22:44,884
How'd you happen to be up there after hours?

165
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:47,406
We had an evacuation. I'd left
some of my things in the sound booth.

166
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:48,396
I had to go back for them.

167
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:52,933
And at that moment there happened to be
a couple of fellas talking about an assassination

168
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:58,473
in a language that you and maybe eight other people
understand, in a room full of microphones.

169
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,837
Do you think I'm making it up?

170
00:23:02,447 --> 00:23:04,938
Why would I report a threat I didn't hear?

171
00:23:05,183 --> 00:23:07,242
- People do.
- I don't.

172
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:10,011
- Some people like attention.
- I don't.

173
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:15,785
- Maybe you don't want Zuwanie at the UN.
- I didn't make it up.

174
00:23:16,027 --> 00:23:20,225
- How do you feel about him?
- I don't care for him.

175
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:23,457
- Wouldn't mind if he were dead?
- If he were gone.

176
00:23:23,702 --> 00:23:25,363
- Same thing.
- No, it isn't.

177
00:23:25,604 --> 00:23:30,473
If I interpreted "gone" as "dead", I'd be fired.
If they were the same, there'd be no UN.

178
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:33,974
- Your profession is playing with words.
- I don't play with words.

179
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:35,941
- You're doing it now.
- You are.

180
00:23:36,181 --> 00:23:40,777
If I wanted him dead, I wouldn't have
reported it. It's not what I want.

181
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:43,078
- That's not why I'm here.
- Here?

182
00:23:43,321 --> 00:23:48,054
Working at the UN, instead of standing
on a road somewhere with a machine-gun.

183
00:23:48,293 --> 00:23:50,784
- You believe in diplomacy?
- I believe in this place.

184
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:56,160
- I believe in what it tries to accomplish.
- Well, you've had a tough year, lady.

185
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,300
Listen.

186
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:04,375
I'm scared, and my protector
is someone who doesn't believe me.

187
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:08,569
You don't look scared.

188
00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:11,305
People handle fear
in different ways, Mr. Keller.

189
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:15,782
It turns some people into stand-up
comedians. You don't know me at all.

190
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:22,788
Maybe I should see about assigning someone
to look after me who's better suited to the job.

191
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:25,019
I don't look after you,

192
00:24:25,263 --> 00:24:30,132
I look after the man who's been
threatened, if there was a threat.

193
00:24:30,368 --> 00:24:34,168
My job, as it concerns you,
is to investigate you.

194
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:38,807
So you're not here to offer me
any protection whatsoever?

195
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:41,171
No, ma'am.

196
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:49,744
And we were getting along so well.

197
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:53,116
- So what do you think?
- She's a liar.

198
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:09,971
Agent Keller? Morning. Special Agent
Lewis, FBI. This is Agent King.

199
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:13,509
We're on loan.

200
00:25:13,745 --> 00:25:17,647
So they have to be returned
in the same condition, or no refund.

201
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:20,511
- Keller.
- Woods.

202
00:25:25,924 --> 00:25:29,985
- Are you sure you're ready to come back?
- I'm better working.

203
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:35,057
- We got a credible threat?
- We should assume so.

204
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:38,360
Cos I gotta tell you, as popular as we are
in the rest of the world these days,

205
00:25:38,603 --> 00:25:42,505
the last thing we can afford is to have
some foreign leader get popped on our soil,

206
00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:45,710
particularly a guy like this
that we don't like.

207
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:48,777
So State wants you to know, NSA, CIA, FBI,

208
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:54,576
whatever you need to keep this maniac's
heart beating till he gets out, it's yours.

209
00:26:02,994 --> 00:26:05,690
<i>Woods.</i>

210
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:11,764
<i>Zuwanie's head of security's arrived.
He wants a meeting right away.</i>

211
00:26:12,003 --> 00:26:14,904
<i>He'll have to wait
till we get back from Washington.</i>

212
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:19,270
<i>- He's white. He was a Dutch mercenary.
- He'll still have to wait.</i>

213
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:22,571
It's hard to remember
that Zuwanie was once a good man.

214
00:26:22,814 --> 00:26:24,907
That's not unusual for these guys.

215
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:29,610
They begin as liberators. 20 minutes later,
they're as corrupt as the tyrants they topple.

216
00:26:29,854 --> 00:26:34,086
He liberated the country from one of
the most corrupt governments on earth,

217
00:26:34,326 --> 00:26:40,094
gave the people hope, and was a hero.
They need another name for what he is now.

218
00:26:40,332 --> 00:26:43,324
- Man likes his gun.
- He'll have it with him.

219
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:45,900
He knows he won't be scanned.

220
00:26:46,137 --> 00:26:47,297
Who are his enemies?

221
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:52,408
Aside from the thousands
of victims' relatives? These two.

222
00:26:54,045 --> 00:26:56,070
Both his opponents, both want his job.

223
00:26:56,314 --> 00:26:58,339
On the right, Ajene Xola.

224
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:03,143
Son of a doctor, Paris-educated,
pacifist to begin with.

225
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:06,118
- Aren't they all?
- He managed longer than most.

226
00:27:06,358 --> 00:27:09,919
<i>- And the other?
- He has two names, he's always in the Post.</i>

227
00:27:10,161 --> 00:27:13,130
One name, twice. Kuman-Kuman.

228
00:27:13,365 --> 00:27:17,461
He's been yelling about Zuwanie being
a madman and the UN not doing enough.

229
00:27:18,436 --> 00:27:19,994
He's in exile in Brooklyn.

230
00:27:20,238 --> 00:27:23,674
A socialist and a capitalist,
both gaining strength with the people,

231
00:27:23,908 --> 00:27:26,468
both with the motivation
to see Zuwanie gone.

232
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:30,411
- Gone?
- Dead.

233
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:33,277
But not just dead.

234
00:27:33,518 --> 00:27:37,852
Dead in front of the delegates of 191 countries
and every news service with a camera.

235
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:41,320
- In front of the world.
- Nobody needs to be that dead.

236
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:46,594
In my opinion,
we're wasting tax dollars staying late.

237
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:48,628
It's a con.

238
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:55,263
- This is the interpreter?
- I need everything CIA has on her.

239
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:35,638
<i>So what do we make of this interpreter?</i>

240
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:40,249
<i>Is she making it up?
Is she imagining things?</i>

241
00:28:40,485 --> 00:28:41,975
I'm looking for Mr. Lud.

242
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:45,678
- Is she pretty?
- I brought you a copy of her UN file.

243
00:28:45,924 --> 00:28:48,620
Dr. Zuwanie won't cancel his speech,
you know.

244
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:52,887
That's up to the GA President,
but you might want to think about it.

245
00:28:53,131 --> 00:28:56,726
- Ms Broome has a Matoban passport.
- Excuse me?

246
00:28:56,968 --> 00:29:00,665
She was born here, she was raised there,
so she has dual citizenship.

247
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:03,635
Are you serious?

248
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:07,438
Black or white?

249
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:09,543
No, thank you.

250
00:29:09,781 --> 00:29:14,047
- Is she black or white?
- White.

251
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:18,887
<i>- Did you give her a polygraph test?
- Not yet, no.</i>

252
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:21,354
<i>Well, shouldn't you?</i>

253
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:51,088
Hi, Ma.

254
00:29:52,323 --> 00:29:56,589
Back off, you're too close. Way too close.
What are you, on a date?

255
00:31:23,948 --> 00:31:28,476
<i>Hey, you got the Kellers. We're out
having a good time, so leave a message.</i>

256
00:31:29,988 --> 00:31:32,013
<i>Hey, you there?</i>

257
00:31:33,758 --> 00:31:35,282
<i>Maybe I made a mistake.</i>

258
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:38,862
<i>Are you there?</i>

259
00:31:39,097 --> 00:31:41,088
<i>Shit.</i>

260
00:31:41,366 --> 00:31:45,860
<i>I told him I want to come back.
He's dropping me off at the airport now,</i>

261
00:31:46,104 --> 00:31:50,700
<i>and I was wondering...
Anyway, you don't have to meet me.</i>

262
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,675
<i>Unless you want to.</i>

263
00:31:56,681 --> 00:31:58,911
<i>I hope you haven't changed the locks.</i>

264
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:53,232
They're ready for you.

265
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:55,336
I'll be right there.

266
00:33:05,883 --> 00:33:09,216
- I'll be right there.
- OK.

267
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:13,250
Ms Broome.

268
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:18,888
- Can I get you anything?
- How about a hood?

269
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:22,657
- I want to split that.
- When do I know the results?

270
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:26,700
Right away.
You know when you're lying, don't you?

271
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:38,544
Look straight ahead, feet flat on the floor.

272
00:33:38,783 --> 00:33:41,445
Is your name Silvia Broome?

273
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:43,913
Miss Broome?

274
00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:47,249
I found out something
from our domestic Intel.

275
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:50,255
All this may have begun
with a tragic accident.

276
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:53,725
- What do you mean?
- Her parents had a farm in the mountains.

277
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:56,900
This area became infested
with rebels in the '80s

278
00:33:57,135 --> 00:33:59,729
and Dr. Zuwanie was forced
to mine the roads.

279
00:33:59,971 --> 00:34:04,374
Her parents were bringing her younger sister
back from school and hit a mine.

280
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:07,237
- And they were killed?
- All of them.

281
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:12,345
- How old was she?
- 12, 13.

282
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:21,492
Something like that, even years later,
could incite all kinds of ideas.

283
00:34:24,796 --> 00:34:29,096
She has every reason
to want Dr. Zuwanie tried at the ICC.

284
00:34:33,971 --> 00:34:36,201
I'll be right back.

285
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:42,979
- Oh, no. Come on.
- OK, the control questions show stress,

286
00:34:43,214 --> 00:34:47,651
and the key questions show stress
as well as the baseline questions.

287
00:34:47,885 --> 00:34:49,750
We should just read her palm.

288
00:34:52,356 --> 00:34:56,122
<i>- How did I do?
- Je ne sais pas.</i>

289
00:34:57,361 --> 00:35:00,660
Nils Lud. Dr. Zuwanie's head of security.

290
00:35:03,334 --> 00:35:08,431
I thought since you were in a
question-answering mood, I might ask one or two.

291
00:35:09,507 --> 00:35:13,341
Might I ask where you stand now
politically, Ms. Broome?

292
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:19,447
I'm for peace and quiet, Mr. Lud.
It's why I came to the UN. Quiet diplomacy.

293
00:35:19,684 --> 00:35:22,778
With respect, you only interpret.

294
00:35:23,888 --> 00:35:27,688
Countries have gone to war
after misinterpreting one another.

295
00:35:27,925 --> 00:35:31,588
I would say she's clearly under stress,
but not necessarily lying.

296
00:35:34,031 --> 00:35:35,157
Congratulations.

297
00:35:35,399 --> 00:35:40,530
- I'm told what you heard was a whisper.
- Yes.

298
00:35:40,771 --> 00:35:44,935
Is it possible you could identify it
if you ever heard it again?

299
00:35:46,444 --> 00:35:48,537
It might be.

300
00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:51,509
Tell me, do you have a brother?

301
00:35:56,087 --> 00:36:00,956
I hope it's all right. I took this opportunity
to ask Miss Broome a few questions.

302
00:36:02,059 --> 00:36:05,995
You're free to go.
Agent Scott will drive you back to the UN.

303
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,995
Would you drive Ms Broome
back to the UN, please? Thank you.

304
00:36:13,237 --> 00:36:17,298
- Does this mean the test was...?
- The test was inconclusive.

305
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:21,842
But I'd rather make the mistake
of believing her than the bigger one of not.

306
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,573
Next time you want to question
an American citizen

307
00:36:23,574 --> 00:36:27,628
in the offices of the United States
Secret Service, you ask permission.

308
00:36:30,087 --> 00:36:32,419
- Silvia.
- Don't worry, I'm not leaving any...

309
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:37,354
Did you do something naughty?
A couple of FBIs were asking me about you.

310
00:36:38,429 --> 00:36:43,366
If you often work later than everybody,
or bring things in after hours. Like that.

311
00:36:44,802 --> 00:36:50,069
- What'd you tell them?
- I said, from a sound engineer's point of view,

312
00:36:50,308 --> 00:36:51,434
you're perfect.

313
00:36:51,742 --> 00:36:54,176
I need somebody on the guy with two names.

314
00:36:54,412 --> 00:36:57,404
- Mo.
- It's one name twice. Kuman-Kuman.

315
00:36:57,682 --> 00:36:59,809
You volunteering, or just correcting me?

316
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:02,417
- I'm from Brooklyn.
- You got him. You and...?

317
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:07,124
- I was on him when he first came here.
- OK, you got him again, you know.

318
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:09,622
I thought she was supposed to have
perfect pitch and all that shit.

319
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:12,454
She says whispers
don't have a recognizable pitch.

320
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:15,460
NSA agrees. They say it's very difficult.

321
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:18,133
- They don't know that.
- They say they do.

322
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:22,066
No, not NSA. Whoever she heard.

323
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:25,973
Why not let them keep
thinking that she can ID it?

324
00:37:27,345 --> 00:37:31,645
- What are you asking me to do, Jay?
- I don't want any harm to come to her.

325
00:37:31,882 --> 00:37:37,184
In fact, get a place, keep an eye on her. We got
three days. She's our only link we've got to these guys.

326
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:39,286
Are we using her as bait?

327
00:37:42,627 --> 00:37:44,026
Just make the calls.

328
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:48,221
I'm sending you an email with an attachment.
Can you print it front and back?

329
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:53,101
I've asked INS for a list of arrivals
in the last six months.

330
00:37:53,337 --> 00:37:57,273
<i>Zimbabwe, Botswana, Matobo.
I'll do voice samples on everyone.</i>

331
00:37:57,508 --> 00:38:02,104
So when she hears the voice again,
she can identify it.

332
00:38:02,346 --> 00:38:06,282
- She said it was a whisper.
- Well, now she thinks she can do it.

333
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:11,210
- Photo there yet?
- It's printing. Let me put you on speaker.

334
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:19,728
That's an anti-Zuwanie rally.
The man speaking is Ajene Xola.

335
00:38:21,065 --> 00:38:24,057
Look at the crowd.

336
00:38:25,569 --> 00:38:26,968
<i>Look closely.</i>

337
00:39:08,045 --> 00:39:09,842
Any leads?

338
00:39:12,616 --> 00:39:15,176
Maybe one.

339
00:39:15,419 --> 00:39:17,546
Come on down to Mexico.

340
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:30,090
Is that you?

341
00:39:35,973 --> 00:39:37,600
Tell me what someone like you

342
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:41,367
who uses the word "diplomacy"
like she's chastising me

343
00:39:41,612 --> 00:39:43,443
is doing at a rebel rally?

344
00:39:43,681 --> 00:39:47,276
- A peace rally.
- I don't want to do this again.

345
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:51,454
That's exactly what it is.
What I'm doing is listening.

346
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:53,384
After that. After you listen.

347
00:39:53,624 --> 00:39:57,458
- You're asking the wrong question.
- It's one you don't want to answer.

348
00:39:57,695 --> 00:40:02,257
Why would somebody type the names
of everyone in this on the back?

349
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:05,435
This is a death list.

350
00:40:07,171 --> 00:40:12,336
The question you should be asking is,
"Who gave me this and why?"

351
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,472
- What are you not saying?
- What are you accusing me of?

352
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:23,676
How do you feel about Zuwanie,
never mind "I don't care for him"?

353
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:26,014
I feel disappointment.

354
00:40:27,324 --> 00:40:29,884
That's a lover's word.

355
00:40:32,129 --> 00:40:34,222
What about rage?

356
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:38,866
Of all the people I've looked into
since this thing started,

357
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:43,335
the one with the darkest
Zuwanie history is you.

358
00:40:45,342 --> 00:40:48,743
- It was his land-mines that killed your...
- Sh!

359
00:40:49,847 --> 00:40:52,407
We don't name the dead.

360
00:40:55,686 --> 00:40:58,154
Everyone who loses somebody
wants revenge,

361
00:40:58,389 --> 00:41:01,085
on God if they can't find anyone else.

362
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:04,784
But in Africa,

363
00:41:06,163 --> 00:41:12,102
in Matobo, the Ku believe that
the only way to end grief is to save a life.

364
00:41:14,672 --> 00:41:17,163
If someone is murdered,

365
00:41:17,408 --> 00:41:22,607
a year of mourning ends with a ritual
that we call the Drowning Man Trial.

366
00:41:23,848 --> 00:41:28,649
There's an all-night party beside a river.
At dawn, the killer is put in a boat.

367
00:41:28,886 --> 00:41:34,347
He's taken out on the water and he's
dropped. He's bound so that he can't swim.

368
00:41:34,592 --> 00:41:38,392
The family of the dead then has to choose.
They can let him drown,

369
00:41:38,629 --> 00:41:40,597
or they can pull him out and save him.

370
00:41:43,033 --> 00:41:47,527
The Ku believe that if the family
lets the killer drown,

371
00:41:47,771 --> 00:41:52,037
they'll have justice but spend
the rest of their lives in mourning.

372
00:41:54,078 --> 00:41:58,981
But if they save him,
if they admit that life isn't always just...

373
00:42:01,752 --> 00:42:04,619
...that very act can take away their sorrow.

374
00:42:07,992 --> 00:42:10,825
Vengeance is a lazy form of grief.

375
00:42:23,674 --> 00:42:25,904
Why do you look away?

376
00:42:28,445 --> 00:42:32,438
There are things I don't like to talk about
and you call it lying.

377
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:35,748
But not when you do it.

378
00:42:37,788 --> 00:42:40,313
I'm not the one under investigation.

379
00:42:47,464 --> 00:42:49,489
That was a long time ago.

380
00:43:30,407 --> 00:43:31,999
<i>- FBI.
- Intel.</i>

381
00:43:32,242 --> 00:43:34,608
- TTF.
- Sniper team.

382
00:43:34,845 --> 00:43:36,938
Secret Service.

383
00:43:37,181 --> 00:43:41,117
This is Nils Lud,
head of Dr. Zuwanie's security.

384
00:43:41,352 --> 00:43:42,979
Shall we take a walk?

385
00:43:55,933 --> 00:44:00,097
- How close can a vehicle get over here?
- Not close enough.

386
00:44:00,337 --> 00:44:04,273
- No garage under the GA.
- Dogs sweep every night. It's not a bomb.

387
00:44:06,076 --> 00:44:09,568
- It has to be a rifle.
- From where?

388
00:44:10,914 --> 00:44:12,677
How does he get a rifle in?

389
00:44:20,591 --> 00:44:23,151
- Could be from up close.
- Who gets that close?

390
00:44:23,394 --> 00:44:25,988
One of Zuwanie's bodyguards?

391
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:31,532
That's a good thought, but we'd much prefer
to kill him at home without you watching.

392
00:44:31,769 --> 00:44:33,737
It's already here.

393
00:44:36,206 --> 00:44:38,970
If these guys know their stuff,
the weapon is here.

394
00:45:00,064 --> 00:45:01,861
Hello?

395
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:05,796
Hello, Philippe? Hello?

396
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:30,824
No prints on the door
and negative for latex dust.

397
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:33,325
- Nothing on the door?
- No.

398
00:45:35,632 --> 00:45:38,100
- No forced entry.
- Did Doug not see him?

399
00:45:38,335 --> 00:45:41,771
No, he missed it.
Some lady called 911, saw the guy.

400
00:45:42,005 --> 00:45:44,906
Go easy on him, OK? He feels terrible.

401
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:52,180
On the roof. He must have gone over the roof
to get to the next building.

402
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:56,785
- I couldn't see the fire escape.
- Give me that.

403
00:45:57,888 --> 00:46:00,288
You mean you screwed up.

404
00:46:01,558 --> 00:46:05,085
- I mean I screwed up.
- So did I.

405
00:46:06,997 --> 00:46:09,932
I need Polaroids of that, inside and out.

406
00:46:12,903 --> 00:46:15,371
- You OK?
- Great.

407
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:18,598
- Who else has a key to this apartment?
- No one.

408
00:46:18,842 --> 00:46:21,868
- You don't keep a spare outside somewhere?
- No.

409
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:24,080
- No one else has a key...
- Nobody.

410
00:46:24,314 --> 00:46:26,874
- The door wasn't forced.
- They can't pick locks?

411
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:30,450
They can, we can tell. They didn't.

412
00:46:30,687 --> 00:46:32,780
- Where do you keep your key?
- My purse.

413
00:46:33,023 --> 00:46:36,015
- It hasn't been out of your sight all day?
- No.

414
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:42,528
Yes.

415
00:46:42,766 --> 00:46:45,200
In my locker.

416
00:46:45,435 --> 00:46:50,998
Dot. Wake up Rory, have him dust her locker
and those beside it before morning.

417
00:46:52,109 --> 00:46:57,513
So you were just having a quiet evening,
some gentleman in a mask waves to you.

418
00:46:57,748 --> 00:47:00,308
That's about it, yeah.

419
00:47:05,856 --> 00:47:06,880
Dot?

420
00:47:08,892 --> 00:47:12,089
Is there anything special about this mask?

421
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:16,163
I'll be honest with you.
I don't know how honest I can be with you.

422
00:47:19,036 --> 00:47:21,436
My brother gave it to me.

423
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:26,266
I still have a brother there
who I'm close to. Simon.

424
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:33,450
We've... lost touch for a while,
but... we're close.

425
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:39,623
Is he standing on the road somewhere with
a machine-gun, or is he into diplomacy, too?

426
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:41,791
He's more into lists.

427
00:47:43,627 --> 00:47:47,188
Farm kids will do anything
to amuse themselves. Mostly you fight.

428
00:47:48,732 --> 00:47:51,792
I read. My brother kept lists.

429
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:54,265
Weird lists in ratty notebooks.

430
00:47:54,504 --> 00:47:57,405
Times and dates that Mum used the F-word,

431
00:47:57,641 --> 00:48:01,407
countries with advantageous
male to female ratios,

432
00:48:01,645 --> 00:48:04,079
odd animal facts.

433
00:48:04,314 --> 00:48:07,613
Did you know the leading cause of death
for beavers is falling trees?

434
00:48:07,851 --> 00:48:11,218
- Yes.
- You did not.

435
00:48:13,991 --> 00:48:16,482
He had a notebook for words that he liked.

436
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:20,288
Hypotenuse, doodad, bodacious.

437
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:24,530
Could he be involved in this?

438
00:48:30,474 --> 00:48:33,307
We're stuck, aren't we? You and I?

439
00:48:34,444 --> 00:48:37,072
<i>We're kepéla.</i>

440
00:48:37,314 --> 00:48:40,044
It means standing on
opposite sides of the river.

441
00:48:44,855 --> 00:48:47,551
Give me a reason to get to the other side.

442
00:49:31,868 --> 00:49:33,893
Just wait a second.

443
00:49:42,879 --> 00:49:44,813
OK.

444
00:49:53,023 --> 00:49:57,983
There's a blue and white outside.
NYPD'll keep an eye on you until morning.

445
00:49:59,696 --> 00:50:01,994
And then?

446
00:50:04,267 --> 00:50:06,963
We'll figure something out.

447
00:50:07,204 --> 00:50:08,364
Thank you.

448
00:50:26,723 --> 00:50:29,954
My wife was killed two weeks ago.

449
00:50:33,797 --> 00:50:36,664
She... she'd left me.

450
00:50:40,237 --> 00:50:44,105
She'd left me before,
but she'd always come back.

451
00:50:44,341 --> 00:50:46,809
She was going to come back this time.

452
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:49,035
She said.

453
00:50:55,752 --> 00:50:57,549
She was a dancer.

454
00:51:01,191 --> 00:51:03,250
The guy was a dancer, too.

455
00:51:04,928 --> 00:51:05,986
Eddie.

456
00:51:08,198 --> 00:51:10,962
Great dancer.

457
00:51:11,201 --> 00:51:13,169
Lousy driver.

458
00:51:14,971 --> 00:51:17,701
The only way he knew how to stop a car

459
00:51:17,941 --> 00:51:21,433
was to slam it
into a bridge abutment in Santa Fe.

460
00:51:24,147 --> 00:51:27,241
So there was no taking her back this time.

461
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:36,659
The thing is, if he had lived,
and I had a choice...

462
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:42,965
...I think I would have let him drown.

463
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:50,401
I might have even
held his head under the water.

464
00:51:56,913 --> 00:51:59,404
Not a very Ku thing to do.

465
00:52:08,425 --> 00:52:12,828
If you need anything, you can call 
the precinct or just go downstairs.

466
00:52:21,905 --> 00:52:23,736
This is my cell number.

467
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:29,510
It's the same card.

468
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:36,143
Goodnight.

469
00:52:39,222 --> 00:52:40,814
Lock this.

470
00:52:42,759 --> 00:52:46,820
It's a remodel. Owner's in the middle
of a divorce. We got lucky.

471
00:52:51,434 --> 00:52:54,995
We got a clear view.
Front door's 50 seconds away.

472
00:52:55,238 --> 00:52:58,401
- I'll do first shift.
- Are Lewis and Clark babysitting Kuman?

473
00:52:58,675 --> 00:53:01,075
Lewis and King. He'll be in bed soon.

474
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:04,439
FBI's right.
Guy does the same routine every day.

475
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:09,978
Call me if she gets
another trick-or-treater. I'm off.

476
00:53:11,755 --> 00:53:13,882
Sweet dreams, partner.

477
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:20,523
<i>...the belief
that the individual needs of people</i>

478
00:53:20,764 --> 00:53:24,791
<i>are paramount to its purpose,
and with it goes the assumption</i>

479
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:29,904
that human rights are fundamental
to human prosperity and development.

480
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:35,205
They cannot be separated.
They can only be said to exist...

481
00:53:35,445 --> 00:53:38,539
You got one shot. You sever the brain stem,
creating paralysis,

482
00:53:38,782 --> 00:53:43,515
you drop the perpetrator without reflex action.
He can't activate a detonator. Thank you.

483
00:53:45,956 --> 00:53:51,258
If you have to issue a verbal warning,
you get very close before you do so.

484
00:53:51,494 --> 00:53:54,292
No. There won't be time for a second one.

485
00:53:54,531 --> 00:53:57,591
Whatever the weapon is, we have
to consider this a suicide bomber.

486
00:53:57,834 --> 00:53:59,995
There's no profile for a suicide bomber.

487
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:04,867
This could be 9 or 90, male or female,
a PhD or a dropout.

488
00:54:05,108 --> 00:54:08,566
All they have in common
is they are not afraid to die.

489
00:54:08,812 --> 00:54:13,943
So this is either a fanatic for a cause
or someone who has nothing to live for.

490
00:54:14,184 --> 00:54:18,518
We'll run two teams. DDO calls the decoy exit
30 seconds before the intersection.

491
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:24,625
NYPD snipers from these two buildings here,
our guys sniper the bridge.

492
00:54:24,861 --> 00:54:28,388
Her locker was clean.
The others were covered with prints.

493
00:54:28,632 --> 00:54:32,398
Someone wiped hers. We're looking
at a janitor or a maintenance worker.

494
00:54:32,636 --> 00:54:34,433
Or another interpreter.

495
00:54:48,218 --> 00:54:51,187
So when do we do this voice line-up?

496
00:54:51,421 --> 00:54:54,015
We're not doing that any more.

497
00:54:54,257 --> 00:54:57,693
- She says she can't.
- Can't what?

498
00:54:57,927 --> 00:55:02,796
ID the voice. She thought she could, now
she thinks she can't. She's sure she can't.

499
00:55:03,033 --> 00:55:08,198
She can't because she can't, or because
she never heard anything to start with?

500
00:55:13,777 --> 00:55:17,713
- He says he wasn't here... I think.
- Not according to this.

501
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:27,681
<i>- He traded shifts with someone. Com quem?
- Jamal.</i>

502
00:55:28,725 --> 00:55:31,660
Jad Jamal. He's in Crown Heights.

503
00:55:48,244 --> 00:55:51,372
Afternoon. Secret Service.
Need to talk to Jad Jamal.

504
00:55:56,653 --> 00:56:00,589
- Does this guy live here?
- No, no here. With lady.

505
00:56:00,824 --> 00:56:04,191
You got lady's number?

506
00:56:04,427 --> 00:56:06,725
Does he have a cell phone?

507
00:56:06,963 --> 00:56:11,923
OK, we'll be back. If he shows up before that,
have him give us a call.

508
00:56:33,656 --> 00:56:36,716
<i>- Hello?
- Silvia, c'est moi. Philippe.</i>

509
00:56:37,794 --> 00:56:38,852
Philippe.

510
00:56:39,596 --> 00:56:42,861
- Going out.
- I got her.

511
00:56:52,108 --> 00:56:54,042
- Shit.
- Shit.

512
00:57:24,707 --> 00:57:27,267
Oh, come on.

513
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:45,124
Philippe.

514
00:57:58,174 --> 00:58:00,540
- What is it?
- I've done a terrible thing.

515
00:58:00,777 --> 00:58:02,768
- It is Simon.
- No, listen.

516
00:58:03,012 --> 00:58:07,608
Someone contacted me.
One of Kuman's people...

517
00:58:07,851 --> 00:58:12,584
I thought it was one of his people...
to arrange a meeting with Xola.

518
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:17,122
They said it was time to admit that
only together could they stop Zuwanie.

519
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:19,590
- What happened?
- So I arrange it.

520
00:58:20,697 --> 00:58:23,359
But it was a trap.

521
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:28,470
Xola's dead.

522
00:58:35,378 --> 00:58:37,778
I knew it.

523
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:39,948
I knew he was dead.

524
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:45,947
Was my brother there?

525
00:58:48,458 --> 00:58:50,983
No, Simon wasn't there. Only Xola.

526
00:58:53,229 --> 00:58:56,562
I stayed in the car. No one came back out.

527
00:58:57,700 --> 00:59:01,261
- Where is he? Where's my brother?
- I don't know.

528
00:59:02,672 --> 00:59:05,971
- You think Kuman has him?
- I don't know what to think.

529
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:11,704
Everything is chaos. It's all gone to hell.
How did it get to be like this?

530
00:59:11,948 --> 00:59:16,442
You see what I did?
I took Xola right to them.

531
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:20,955
- You didn't know.
- Forgive me.

532
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:27,728
- I was only trying to help.
- There's nothing to forgive.

533
00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:30,858
Yes, there is.

534
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:33,193
- I have to go.
- Philippe.

535
00:59:44,447 --> 00:59:49,885
You cannot do that. How the hell do I
protect you if I don't know where you are?

536
00:59:50,119 --> 00:59:53,384
You emphatically told me that you weren't.

537
00:59:53,623 --> 00:59:59,186
That was before you had a man in a mask
on your fire escape.

538
01:00:00,630 --> 01:00:04,259
I've had a 24-hour shift of agents
across the street.

539
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:09,234
Who was that in the park?

540
01:00:10,974 --> 01:00:13,670
- It's personal.
- We're past that. What's his name?

541
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:15,036
It's not your business.

542
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:18,839
Is he the one you e-mailed
before reporting the threat?

543
01:00:21,184 --> 01:00:25,678
"Where are you?
I'm worried about you. Write me. "

544
01:00:25,922 --> 01:00:29,016
"Please. I need to know you're OK"?

545
01:00:30,827 --> 01:00:33,091
Worried why? Because he's involved?

546
01:00:34,330 --> 01:00:39,131
Is that him, here, now, in my country,
making threats? That is my business.

547
01:00:39,369 --> 01:00:42,497
You're wrong.
It's got nothing to do with you.

548
01:01:24,614 --> 01:01:26,741
<i>I'll take care of you.</i>

549
01:01:38,995 --> 01:01:43,762
- I'm going to Starbucks. Want anything?
- Just what I need, another night without sleep.

550
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,491
I'm good. Thanks.

551
01:01:48,738 --> 01:01:51,206
What's up with Common Kuman?

552
01:01:51,441 --> 01:01:53,966
- Brushing his teeth.
- I gotta talk to him.

553
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:58,510
Café Atlantic, noon to two, then
the Nava Club for a steam and massage.

554
01:01:58,748 --> 01:02:02,149
- Coffee?
- No, I'm good, thanks.

555
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:09,320
She can't sleep either.
Just turned the TV on.

556
01:02:10,426 --> 01:02:12,451
Probably PBS.

557
01:02:13,963 --> 01:02:16,955
- Where you going?
- You're here with your bag.

558
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:20,135
I can go home and get a good night's sleep.

559
01:02:22,171 --> 01:02:24,162
Unless you want me to stay.

560
01:02:26,542 --> 01:02:27,975
No. Thanks.

561
01:02:28,244 --> 01:02:31,680
- Thanks.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

562
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:36,851
<i>United Nations, New York. Protests
erupted here following an announcement</i>

563
01:02:37,086 --> 01:02:41,523
<i>that President Edmond Zuwanie
will address the General Assembly Friday.</i>

564
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:45,751
<i>The exiled leader Kuman-Kuman
rallied today's protesters.</i>

565
01:02:45,995 --> 01:02:48,930
<i>He would be more convincing
if he were assassinated.</i>

566
01:02:49,198 --> 01:02:50,722
<i>He doesn't even have to die.</i>

567
01:02:50,967 --> 01:02:53,731
<i>An almost-assassinated leader
gets so much credibility,</i>

568
01:02:53,970 --> 01:02:57,497
<i>he can do anything he wants...
and stick around to enjoy it.</i>

569
01:02:57,740 --> 01:03:02,404
<i>Security is on heightened alert
in response to anonymous threats...</i>

570
01:03:05,348 --> 01:03:08,215
<i>- Keller.
- I'm sorry.</i>

571
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:12,148
I really didn't know you were watching me...

572
01:03:14,123 --> 01:03:17,354
<i>...or I wouldn't have just
... left like that.</i>

573
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:23,254
<i>- You want to tell me what happened?
- I had to meet someone.</i>

574
01:03:24,433 --> 01:03:28,733
- Philippe Broullet.
- If you knew, why did you ask?

575
01:03:28,971 --> 01:03:32,930
I know his name, I know he's
a photographer for a French magazine.

576
01:03:33,176 --> 01:03:37,135
- He needed to talk to me.
- Now you're watching TV, unable to sleep.

577
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:39,974
- What did he say?
- How do you know I'm...?

578
01:03:40,249 --> 01:03:42,410
Are you over there?

579
01:03:48,624 --> 01:03:50,421
Jesus.

580
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:58,824
He told me we lost a friend.

581
01:03:59,068 --> 01:04:03,505
He lost a friend.
I... lost someone I loved once.

582
01:04:04,807 --> 01:04:07,503
It was a long time ago.

583
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:12,576
You can't sleep either.

584
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:15,909
I don't know why I'm calling you.

585
01:04:16,152 --> 01:04:20,088
- What do you do when you can't sleep?
- I stay awake.

586
01:04:25,995 --> 01:04:28,759
You don't name the dead, you said. Why?

587
01:04:30,233 --> 01:04:32,326
What... what happens?

588
01:04:34,704 --> 01:04:37,969
You move past them. You leave them behind.

589
01:04:39,041 --> 01:04:42,977
You can do that,
but you have to be ready to let them go.

590
01:04:43,246 --> 01:04:44,975
To move on.

591
01:04:46,682 --> 01:04:49,879
You've been going through hell.

592
01:04:50,119 --> 01:04:51,677
Keeping busy.

593
01:04:53,856 --> 01:04:57,986
You, too, I think. I don't know
all of it, but...

594
01:05:07,069 --> 01:05:10,197
Are you going to be there until morning?

595
01:05:10,439 --> 01:05:12,498
It almost is morning.

596
01:05:13,609 --> 01:05:15,975
Yeah, I'll be here.

597
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:21,180
Is it OK if I just try to fall asleep
over the phone?

598
01:05:26,222 --> 01:05:29,157
That's fine.

599
01:05:48,744 --> 01:05:50,336
Goodnight.

600
01:06:02,191 --> 01:06:04,022
<i>She's coming your way.</i>

601
01:06:06,195 --> 01:06:10,791
Oh, no. No scooter, please.
Come on, no scooter.

602
01:06:11,033 --> 01:06:13,399
Yes. Thank you, God.

603
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:27,643
You might as well drive me.
We're going to Brooklyn.

604
01:06:29,485 --> 01:06:31,544
Corner of Bergen and Nostrand.

605
01:06:31,787 --> 01:06:36,224
Jad Jamal. Worked the interpreters' lounge
the day the mask showed up.

606
01:06:36,459 --> 01:06:39,917
- Bring him to me.
- Can't. He didn't show up for work.

607
01:06:40,162 --> 01:06:42,096
- Sit on his apartment.
- Doug's there.

608
01:06:42,365 --> 01:06:44,663
Hey. Got the INS files.

609
01:06:55,644 --> 01:07:00,445
- This isn't the way it's supposed to be done.
- You can let me off up here.

610
01:07:19,668 --> 01:07:23,035
<i>She's at the corner of Bergen
and Nostrand in Brooklyn.</i>

611
01:07:23,272 --> 01:07:26,503
- She's where?
- My guy's on the move.

612
01:07:29,011 --> 01:07:31,138
<i>She's here, whether I brought her or not.</i>

613
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:33,848
<i>- Go back. What's she doing?
- Waiting for something.</i>

614
01:07:34,083 --> 01:07:36,483
- Holy shit.
- What?

615
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:38,983
The janitor. Jad Jamal.

616
01:07:39,221 --> 01:07:42,816
- That's not him.
- I know. That's his room-mate.

617
01:07:54,136 --> 01:07:56,070
Jamal's room-mate just left the building.

618
01:07:56,305 --> 01:07:58,967
His name is Gamba. Jean Gamba.

619
01:07:59,208 --> 01:08:02,575
- Should I stay here?
- No, you stick with the room-mate.

620
01:08:02,812 --> 01:08:05,747
- Are we working on a warrant?
- Lewis is.

621
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:08,245
- How are you?
- I got something for you.

622
01:08:08,517 --> 01:08:11,247
OK, bless you.

623
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:49,219
Tobin?

624
01:08:58,934 --> 01:09:01,767
- What's up?
- I don't know, but it don't feel good.

625
01:09:04,373 --> 01:09:07,399
- What are they doing?
- Just standing there.

626
01:09:14,517 --> 01:09:16,542
<i>We're getting on the el.</i>

627
01:09:29,732 --> 01:09:32,360
- Shit.
- She just got on the bus with Kuman.

628
01:09:33,903 --> 01:09:36,064
What the hell is she doing?

629
01:09:47,900 --> 01:09:50,027
Did I hear home?

630
01:09:51,737 --> 01:09:55,434
- Or was I wrong, then?
- No, you're right. I'm Matoban.

631
01:09:55,675 --> 01:09:58,075
And a fair Matoban, in fact.

632
01:10:00,746 --> 01:10:02,907
<i>King, you stay with that bus.</i>

633
01:10:06,452 --> 01:10:08,943
Do you know who I am?

634
01:10:09,188 --> 01:10:10,212
Yes.

635
01:10:12,058 --> 01:10:15,619
You're a killer.
You ordered the murder of Ajene Xola.

636
01:10:23,803 --> 01:10:27,705
You got a red light in that car?
Why don't you use it?

637
01:10:27,940 --> 01:10:32,240
- Who told you this nonsense?
- Where's my brother?

638
01:10:32,478 --> 01:10:35,311
Your brother? I don't even know who you are.

639
01:10:36,449 --> 01:10:40,783
You are on the wrong bus, so to speak,
to be so reckless.

640
01:10:49,028 --> 01:10:52,589
Your people arranged a meeting
through Philippe Broullet.

641
01:10:52,832 --> 01:10:56,461
- You know him.
- I don't... and I didn't.

642
01:10:56,702 --> 01:11:01,469
But the fact is, somebody wants you
to believe that I killed Ajene Xola.

643
01:11:02,608 --> 01:11:07,568
- I don't believe you.
- But you should believe me.

644
01:11:07,813 --> 01:11:10,976
- Why?
- Because I would form a coalition with Xola.

645
01:11:11,918 --> 01:11:15,149
Neither of us have made
enough progress alone.

646
01:11:15,388 --> 01:11:18,516
He has the working people.
I have the finances.

647
01:11:18,758 --> 01:11:24,287
If he is dead, it is a loss
for all of us. Me especially.

648
01:11:24,530 --> 01:11:26,760
<i>We're getting off.</i>

649
01:11:30,636 --> 01:11:32,763
I got the back room.

650
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:39,769
Jesus.

651
01:11:41,581 --> 01:11:43,105
Clear the other room.

652
01:11:55,761 --> 01:11:57,626
OK.

653
01:11:57,863 --> 01:12:00,525
- Closet.
- Yeah. I got the bed.

654
01:12:14,714 --> 01:12:17,547
Ho! Keller?

655
01:12:20,953 --> 01:12:23,683
- We got a dead body in the closet.
- Jamal?

656
01:12:23,923 --> 01:12:28,519
Yeah. I'll call it in.
God, how can you see in here?

657
01:12:28,761 --> 01:12:30,524
Wait. Wait.

658
01:12:35,067 --> 01:12:37,558
Why the lanterns?

659
01:12:41,274 --> 01:12:43,367
Well, that's just rude.

660
01:13:06,098 --> 01:13:10,694
- What do you do so far away from home?
- I work. And I hope.

661
01:13:10,936 --> 01:13:14,372
- Same as me, then.
- I doubt it.

662
01:13:18,177 --> 01:13:20,236
You work for...?

663
01:13:20,479 --> 01:13:23,414
I'm an interpreter at the UN.

664
01:13:23,683 --> 01:13:27,779
So like the UN.
Layers of languages signifying nothing.

665
01:13:28,020 --> 01:13:30,784
- You'd prefer more war?
- I prefer more business.

666
01:13:31,023 --> 01:13:33,787
Guys, get with me here. We got a situation.

667
01:13:34,026 --> 01:13:39,259
No, boss, we got a situation.
We just got on the 133. With Mohammad.

668
01:13:39,498 --> 01:13:42,990
<i>And Silvia Broome. And Kuman-Kuman.</i>

669
01:13:43,235 --> 01:13:45,669
- What?
- You're on the same bus?

670
01:13:45,905 --> 01:13:47,463
With our subjects.

671
01:13:47,707 --> 01:13:51,302
Get off the bus,
and get Silvia Broome off that bus now.

672
01:13:51,544 --> 01:13:53,944
We can't do that. We're moving.

673
01:13:55,147 --> 01:13:57,479
Doug, is the room-mate carrying anything?

674
01:14:02,321 --> 01:14:05,449
- Doug, is he carrying anything?
- A satchel.

675
01:14:07,059 --> 01:14:12,258
- All right... where is it?
- It's in his lap. He's been carrying it all day.

676
01:14:12,498 --> 01:14:15,797
- Oh, man.
- Can either of you get to him?

677
01:14:17,870 --> 01:14:20,668
Not without gettin' made.

678
01:14:20,906 --> 01:14:24,433
Despite all the flags on First Avenue,
there are no nations any more.

679
01:14:24,677 --> 01:14:30,479
Only companies. International companies.
It's where we are. It's what we are.

680
01:14:34,053 --> 01:14:36,180
I think you're wrong.

681
01:14:36,422 --> 01:14:39,823
You are still young. I'm an acquired taste.

682
01:14:42,461 --> 01:14:44,827
What's your brother's name?

683
01:14:47,133 --> 01:14:50,694
Simon. Simon Broome.

684
01:14:50,936 --> 01:14:54,872
- OK, we're stopping.
- You got guts, coming out here.

685
01:14:58,043 --> 01:15:01,206
I'll see what my people
can find out about him.

686
01:15:01,447 --> 01:15:06,475
But remember,
I'm not your brother's keeper, eh?

687
01:15:06,719 --> 01:15:08,812
Yeah. Thank you.

688
01:15:10,623 --> 01:15:13,558
Come on, guys, talk to me. What's going on?

689
01:15:13,793 --> 01:15:16,387
We're stopped. She's getting off.

690
01:15:18,964 --> 01:15:23,060
- What's going on?
- And so is my subject.

691
01:15:24,270 --> 01:15:29,105
Keep talking to me. What's going on?
Is he carrying the satchel?

692
01:15:29,341 --> 01:15:32,367
OK, he's got the satchel.
But I think he made me.

693
01:15:32,611 --> 01:15:34,010
That's OK, I got him.

694
01:15:35,648 --> 01:15:37,673
- Kuman?
- He's staying put.

695
01:15:37,917 --> 01:15:40,078
Miss Broome! Please get in the car.

696
01:15:42,421 --> 01:15:43,718
Move it!

697
01:15:43,956 --> 01:15:46,015
- I got Gamba.
- I'll stay with Kuman.

698
01:15:46,258 --> 01:15:51,059
No. Just get off that bus.
Get everybody off that bus right now!

699
01:15:54,467 --> 01:15:56,196
- Doug!
- Mohammad?

700
01:15:57,903 --> 01:16:01,134
- Hey! Guy forgot his lunch.
- Oh, man.

701
01:16:22,461 --> 01:16:25,055
I'm standing here on Nostrand Avenue
in Crown Heights,

702
01:16:25,297 --> 01:16:28,789
at a scene that can only be described
as unconscionable carnage.

703
01:16:29,034 --> 01:16:32,970
...frantically helping victims
of an apparent terrorist attack.

704
01:16:33,239 --> 01:16:36,936
These events are more familiar
in the cities of the Middle East.

705
01:16:37,176 --> 01:16:41,476
There is no word yet.
However, there are unconfirmed reports

706
01:16:41,714 --> 01:16:46,515
that Kuman-Kuman, the exiled Matoban
revolutionary, may have been on board.

707
01:16:46,752 --> 01:16:48,777
- You all right?
- I'm OK.

708
01:16:49,021 --> 01:16:51,615
Doug?

709
01:16:57,863 --> 01:17:01,355
This is Ron Ferguson, reporting live
on Nostrand Avenue in Brooklyn,

710
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:04,592
where just after 10.30 am this morning...

711
01:17:10,543 --> 01:17:12,534
We're OK, boss.

712
01:17:15,247 --> 01:17:19,479
<i>the violence has now found
its way into the heart of New York City...</i>

713
01:17:19,718 --> 01:17:24,519
<i>- The death toll is 17, with scores injured...
- The obvious speculation about al-Qaeda...</i>

714
01:17:24,757 --> 01:17:27,783
<i>...widely seen as the probable successor
to Edmond Zuwanie...</i>

715
01:17:28,027 --> 01:17:30,723
<i>Tunnels and bridges
will close for at least 12 hours...</i>

716
01:17:30,996 --> 01:17:33,658
<i>...alleged terrorist attack by Ajene Xola...</i>

717
01:17:33,899 --> 01:17:37,858
<i>...Zuwanie is still planning to address
the General Assembly of the UN.</i>

718
01:17:47,947 --> 01:17:50,848
What were you doing on that bus?

719
01:17:51,951 --> 01:17:54,818
Thank you for bringing me home.

720
01:18:04,163 --> 01:18:06,393
Hey!

721
01:18:08,801 --> 01:18:11,770
I lost a man today. A kid.

722
01:18:14,773 --> 01:18:17,537
- How do you know Kuman?
- I don't, I never met him before.

723
01:18:17,776 --> 01:18:21,371
You think that not getting caught in a lie
is the same thing as telling the truth!

724
01:18:21,614 --> 01:18:24,742
- I'm not lying. I went to him for help.
- With what?

725
01:18:24,984 --> 01:18:27,919
I can't tell you. Someone might get hurt.

726
01:18:28,187 --> 01:18:32,419
"Someone might get hurt. "
There's a bus full of dead people!

727
01:18:32,658 --> 01:18:35,786
"Someone might get hurt"?
Who? Someone you know?

728
01:18:36,061 --> 01:18:39,622
Someone who's mixed up in all this?
You? Why did you leave Africa?

729
01:18:39,865 --> 01:18:42,959
- I told you.
- No, you didn't tell me. Why did you come here?

730
01:18:43,202 --> 01:18:45,261
- Stop it.
- Goddammit!

731
01:18:45,504 --> 01:18:47,404
- Stop shouting at me!
- Stop lying!

732
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:49,267
- I'm not lying!
- Stop lying!

733
01:18:49,508 --> 01:18:54,810
I was just on that bus! I can't think
with all this noise. I can't! You have to stop!

734
01:19:16,135 --> 01:19:19,127
That isn't me.

735
01:19:19,371 --> 01:19:21,168
Don't be ridiculous.

736
01:19:22,608 --> 01:19:25,736
- It isn't me.
- No, that is you.

737
01:19:25,978 --> 01:19:28,344
And I know, because I drive you home,

738
01:19:28,614 --> 01:19:33,779
and I look at you through the binoculars,
and everything else that I shouldn't do.

739
01:19:38,023 --> 01:19:41,117
It was once.

740
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:43,351
It's not any more.

741
01:19:45,364 --> 01:19:50,358
After the rallies,
after my parents and sister were killed,

742
01:19:50,602 --> 01:19:52,968
then the rifles came out.

743
01:19:54,573 --> 01:19:58,475
It was the only way to get anyone to listen.
Just to listen.

744
01:20:02,247 --> 01:20:07,776
I killed a boy who had nothing to live for
beyond the money he'd get for killing me.

745
01:20:09,688 --> 01:20:12,680
I shot him in the head
so he wouldn't shoot me.

746
01:20:18,030 --> 01:20:22,194
Then I handed the rifle to my brother
and told him, "I'm through. "

747
01:20:22,434 --> 01:20:27,064
I walked away with him shouting at me,
"You're a coward. "

748
01:20:27,306 --> 01:20:30,469
"Our parents are dead, Zuwanie's alive. "

749
01:20:32,811 --> 01:20:36,907
My brother,
who in another life wouldn't harm a...

750
01:20:41,420 --> 01:20:44,253
That was the last thing he ever said to me.

751
01:20:44,490 --> 01:20:48,824
The only contact I have is the notebooks
I send and imagine him receiving.

752
01:20:49,061 --> 01:20:51,723
I know he's alive. I know it.

753
01:20:53,699 --> 01:20:55,394
But I'm not to him.

754
01:21:00,339 --> 01:21:03,172
I lied to you because I was afraid.

755
01:21:04,276 --> 01:21:07,507
I was afraid
he might be involved in what I heard.

756
01:21:10,616 --> 01:21:14,518
I lied to everyone else
so they'd let me near the UN,

757
01:21:14,753 --> 01:21:19,656
and that's the only place that I believe
has a chance to change any of this.

758
01:21:20,859 --> 01:21:24,192
And I lied to you 
about Ajene Xola because...

759
01:21:24,429 --> 01:21:27,159
I loved him. Once.

760
01:21:28,267 --> 01:21:31,725
Until the color of my skin became a problem.

761
01:21:31,970 --> 01:21:34,200
The politics of my skin.

762
01:21:37,109 --> 01:21:42,706
I walked away from Africa with nothing.
No brother, no family, no lover, nothing.

763
01:21:42,948 --> 01:21:48,045
Just a belief that words and compassion
are the better way.

764
01:21:49,321 --> 01:21:52,051
Even if it's slower than a gun.

765
01:22:01,366 --> 01:22:03,596
Where are you going?

766
01:22:04,770 --> 01:22:07,398
You've got blood all over your face.

767
01:22:07,639 --> 01:22:10,938
You can't say stuff like that
with blood on your face.

768
01:23:56,782 --> 01:24:00,218
This is precisely why Dr. Zuwanie
must be allowed to speak.

769
01:24:02,921 --> 01:24:05,890
This monstrous act of terrorism
was aimed at you...

770
01:24:08,627 --> 01:24:11,255
...and at the heart of the United Nations.

771
01:24:11,496 --> 01:24:15,125
- I can't listen to this.
- Do not allow them to intimidate you...

772
01:24:16,401 --> 01:24:17,561
...or Dr. Zuwanie.

773
01:24:18,804 --> 01:24:21,204
I'm not at liberty to tell you.

774
01:24:29,014 --> 01:24:32,347
- Where we going?
- Bathroom.

775
01:24:37,723 --> 01:24:39,350
Keller.

776
01:25:00,078 --> 01:25:03,241
Get this processed
and back to me right away.

777
01:25:33,612 --> 01:25:36,274
Did he leave a note?

778
01:25:41,887 --> 01:25:44,014
Did you read it?

779
01:25:44,256 --> 01:25:46,520
Of course you did.

780
01:25:50,062 --> 01:25:53,054
Would you read it to me, please?

781
01:26:03,141 --> 01:26:08,738
"Dear Silvia, I came to tell you something
and then didn't. "

782
01:26:09,881 --> 01:26:14,011
"I wanted to, but when I saw you
I couldn't find the words. "

783
01:26:16,254 --> 01:26:20,850
"I told you I didn't know where Simon is.
That was a lie. "

784
01:26:21,093 --> 01:26:24,529
"He was there that day.
A young boy shot him. "

785
01:26:28,333 --> 01:26:31,734
"I couldn't tell you. I'm a coward.
Simon was braver than me. "

786
01:26:32,003 --> 01:26:34,597
"You're braver than me. I'm so sorry. "

787
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:37,240
I'm so sorry.

788
01:26:40,579 --> 01:26:43,047
The second time was me.

789
01:26:57,262 --> 01:27:01,426
I feel like my friends must feel
when they try to say something.

790
01:27:03,702 --> 01:27:07,399
- It's all right.
- That's what I say to them.

791
01:27:20,719 --> 01:27:22,949
He left this with the note.

792
01:27:29,995 --> 01:27:33,726
The only thing that I wanted...

793
01:27:40,805 --> 01:27:43,433
...besides having her back...

794
01:27:43,675 --> 01:27:45,836
was to be left alone.

795
01:29:25,010 --> 01:29:26,841
<i>Don't cry.</i>

796
01:29:28,246 --> 01:29:32,046
<i>- Don't cry.
- I'm not crying.</i>

797
01:29:32,284 --> 01:29:34,946
<i>- You don't have to cry.
- I'm not.</i>

798
01:29:35,220 --> 01:29:38,747
<i>Because I'm here,
and I won't leave. I promise.</i>

799
01:29:39,991 --> 01:29:43,392
<i>Look at me. I'll take care of you.</i>

800
01:29:45,096 --> 01:29:47,758
<i>We'll take care of each other.</i>

801
01:29:50,335 --> 01:29:52,530
<i>I'll take care of you.</i>

802
01:30:07,819 --> 01:30:09,912
<i>Promise me.</i>

803
01:30:16,494 --> 01:30:18,621
<i>I promise.</i>

804
01:30:37,415 --> 01:30:39,713
<i>I promise.</i>

805
01:33:06,431 --> 01:33:09,867
Xola's dead. Kuman's dead.

806
01:33:12,170 --> 01:33:14,229
Who do you work for?

807
01:33:15,039 --> 01:33:19,476
- Don't touch.
- Those things'll kill you.

808
01:33:42,066 --> 01:33:43,556
Russell!

809
01:34:26,277 --> 01:34:27,266
<i>Hey!</i>

810
01:34:30,148 --> 01:34:32,878
<i>- What the hell's going on?
- Close the door!</i>

811
01:34:37,722 --> 01:34:39,587
Silvia!

812
01:34:40,658 --> 01:34:43,320
Silvia!

813
01:35:13,157 --> 01:35:14,852
Silvia!

814
01:35:16,661 --> 01:35:18,754
Keller!

815
01:35:18,997 --> 01:35:20,294
Keller!

816
01:35:25,803 --> 01:35:29,068
She's not here. Check the roof.

817
01:35:46,290 --> 01:35:47,382
Jay?

818
01:35:50,628 --> 01:35:54,428
- Dot, what have you got?
- There was something on her credit card.

819
01:35:54,666 --> 01:35:58,466
His name is Jean Gamba. He's our bomber.

820
01:36:00,338 --> 01:36:03,501
- And our assassin?
- That would be good for us.

821
01:36:03,741 --> 01:36:05,333
But I doubt it.

822
01:36:05,576 --> 01:36:07,168
He tried to kill her.

823
01:36:07,412 --> 01:36:10,540
- What happened?
- I shot him.

824
01:36:12,350 --> 01:36:15,945
That's a pity.
He might have told us something.

825
01:36:16,187 --> 01:36:18,985
- And Miss Broome?
- Gone.

826
01:36:19,223 --> 01:36:24,251
- He killed her?
- She was gone before he got there.

827
01:36:28,132 --> 01:36:31,192
- Mind if I take a look upstairs?
- Hold on. Dino?

828
01:36:31,436 --> 01:36:35,497
- Yeah.
- Take Mr. Lud to the apartment. And Brian?

829
01:36:35,740 --> 01:36:41,178
- Get NYPD to push their tapeline...
- Keller? Go home and get some sleep.

830
01:36:41,446 --> 01:36:44,006
- I'm gonna stay here and wait for her.
- Like hell you are.

831
01:36:44,248 --> 01:36:49,015
I need you awake tomorrow morning.
Woods? Get him home.

832
01:36:54,792 --> 01:36:59,161
- Drive around the block.
- You heard Jay. I gotta take you home.

833
01:36:59,397 --> 01:37:04,767
What if there were two guys? Three?
We just set the trap and run? Is that it?

834
01:37:05,803 --> 01:37:09,637
They're not our family
and they're not our friends.

835
01:37:09,874 --> 01:37:11,501
You told me that.

836
01:37:11,743 --> 01:37:16,737
You lose somebody, you lose somebody.
I don't want to lose two somebodys.

837
01:37:20,618 --> 01:37:23,678
One circle, then I'm taking you home.

838
01:37:45,176 --> 01:37:48,805
<i>Hello? Are you there?</i>

839
01:37:51,249 --> 01:37:55,652
<i>I'm fine. I'm all right, but I...</i>

840
01:37:55,887 --> 01:37:58,617
<i>I can't talk to you.</i>

841
01:37:58,856 --> 01:38:03,418
<i>You were right.
My brother... my brother was right.</i>

842
01:38:03,661 --> 01:38:06,994
<i>It takes too long, Tobin. I'm going home.</i>

843
01:38:33,057 --> 01:38:33,989
Keller.

844
01:38:34,258 --> 01:38:37,989
<i>Keller, Lewis. Those numbers
scribbled on Jamal's kitchen wall.</i>

845
01:38:38,229 --> 01:38:42,495
Ray's Pizza, some sex lines,
a hardware store and a global cell phone.

846
01:38:42,733 --> 01:38:44,428
Chase down the global cell.

847
01:38:44,669 --> 01:38:46,603
<i>- Keller, it's Mo.
- Go ahead, Mo.</i>

848
01:38:46,838 --> 01:38:48,999
She booked a flight online.

849
01:38:49,240 --> 01:38:52,971
Check all flights to South Africa
out of JFK, LaGuardia and Newark.

850
01:38:53,211 --> 01:38:55,543
And then what? If I find her.

851
01:38:59,016 --> 01:39:01,143
Get her on the phone with me.

852
01:39:07,325 --> 01:39:09,156
He's here.

853
01:39:30,548 --> 01:39:33,073
That's him?

854
01:39:35,653 --> 01:39:36,677
Second car.

855
01:39:58,109 --> 01:40:01,875
Keller? Lewis.
The global cell belongs to Jean Gamba.

856
01:40:02,113 --> 01:40:04,308
<i>- Got the times of the calls?
- Yeah.</i>

857
01:40:04,548 --> 01:40:07,415
Day before yesterday, 3.30 pm.
Anything there?

858
01:40:07,652 --> 01:40:11,179
- Day before yesterday, 3.30?
- 3.30, yeah.

859
01:40:11,422 --> 01:40:13,890
Call it. No, have Lewis call.

860
01:40:14,158 --> 01:40:15,989
- I'm Lewis.
- Clark, I mean.

861
01:40:16,227 --> 01:40:18,991
- No, King. And he's dialing.
- Extension 647.

862
01:40:19,230 --> 01:40:22,222
The bus. Right after.
I wanna know the very first call he made.

863
01:40:22,500 --> 01:40:26,231
It's King. It's the Matoban mission.
An extension.

864
01:40:28,572 --> 01:40:32,838
- Lud?
- No, someone named Marcus Matu.

865
01:40:33,077 --> 01:40:35,705
Head over. I need a face for that name.

866
01:41:03,207 --> 01:41:04,936
<i>She's booked 9 am, JFK.</i>

867
01:41:05,209 --> 01:41:08,667
<i>- I'm on the LIE. Almost there.
- Call me from the gate.</i>

868
01:41:41,312 --> 01:41:45,646
Not as much sky as I remember,
but more skyscrapers.

869
01:41:45,883 --> 01:41:49,580
23 years, Dr. Zuwanie. Things change.

870
01:41:49,820 --> 01:41:51,412
They diminish.

871
01:41:53,224 --> 01:41:55,454
Desire diminishes.

872
01:41:56,560 --> 01:42:00,553
- Where is the Second Avenue?
- Just after we get off the bridge.

873
01:42:01,866 --> 01:42:04,699
They decorated the bridge.

874
01:42:04,935 --> 01:42:10,032
When I came here before, they lined
the bridge with flowers, welcoming me.

875
01:42:10,307 --> 01:42:12,741
- That flight departs from gate one.
- Thank you.

876
01:42:13,010 --> 01:42:17,777
- No sign of her. Hasn't checked in yet.
- Let me know when it's boarding.

877
01:42:18,015 --> 01:42:21,178
Is there any way we can hold 'em
in a safe room just to buy time?

878
01:42:21,419 --> 01:42:24,115
You can try, but it's up to him.

879
01:42:28,259 --> 01:42:32,491
There was a parade.
Right here on this Second Avenue.

880
01:42:32,730 --> 01:42:35,164
There was a snowstorm of confetti.

881
01:42:50,381 --> 01:42:51,814
Murderer!

882
01:42:56,420 --> 01:42:58,285
This is Second Avenue, sir.

883
01:43:10,901 --> 01:43:13,335
- Are you at the mission?
- Yeah, but he isn't.

884
01:43:13,604 --> 01:43:17,734
- Nobody knows where he is.
- They know, they just won't tell us.

885
01:43:17,975 --> 01:43:19,738
<i>- You get a photo ID?
- Yeah.</i>

886
01:43:19,977 --> 01:43:23,413
Go back inside
and fax that to UN security now.

887
01:43:23,681 --> 01:43:26,149
Get his address and get over there.

888
01:43:26,417 --> 01:43:28,385
I've got eight minutes.

889
01:44:01,986 --> 01:44:03,317
Keep it tight.

890
01:44:21,372 --> 01:44:23,397
Agent Keller!

891
01:44:37,555 --> 01:44:41,321
He's here. I just saw him.
Broadcast that description.

892
01:44:57,441 --> 01:45:00,740
49th... 42nd.

893
01:45:02,012 --> 01:45:03,809
Good. Next.

894
01:45:04,048 --> 01:45:06,414
Move on.

895
01:45:18,329 --> 01:45:20,456
There it is.

896
01:45:30,074 --> 01:45:32,599
- OK.
- All right, go.

897
01:45:38,115 --> 01:45:41,084
<i>- Levels, please.
- Un, deux, trois...</i>

898
01:45:55,733 --> 01:46:00,534
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, British Airways
flight 178 to Johannesburg is ready to close.</i>

899
01:46:00,771 --> 01:46:03,569
<i>Please make your way
to gate one immediately. Thank you.</i>

900
01:46:03,807 --> 01:46:09,040
Thank you. Levels, please.

901
01:46:51,889 --> 01:46:57,794
The Assembly will first hear an address
by the President of the Republic of Matobo.

902
01:46:58,062 --> 01:47:00,326
On behalf of the General Assembly,

903
01:47:00,564 --> 01:47:03,226
I have the honor to welcome
to the United Nations

904
01:47:03,467 --> 01:47:08,769
His Excellency Dr. Edmond Zuwanie,
President of the Republic of Matobo,

905
01:47:09,006 --> 01:47:12,305
and to invite him to address the Assembly.

906
01:47:24,021 --> 01:47:27,320
Mr. President, Mr. Secretary-General.

907
01:47:27,558 --> 01:47:30,459
Today my beloved country is under siege.

908
01:47:30,694 --> 01:47:33,663
As you saw the other afternoon
across the river in Brooklyn,

909
01:47:33,931 --> 01:47:37,094
the terrorists in my country
will stop at nothing.

910
01:47:37,334 --> 01:47:41,498
How am I to defend my country
against enemies like these?

911
01:47:41,739 --> 01:47:45,175
- I admit I have dealt harshly with terrorists...
- Tobin, it's King.

912
01:47:45,442 --> 01:47:48,002
...as we all will have to.
- I don't think Matu's here.

913
01:47:48,245 --> 01:47:52,045
Remember the profile of suicide bombers
and how there isn't one?

914
01:47:52,282 --> 01:47:54,944
<i>...who know the evil
and violence of real terrorism...</i>

915
01:47:55,185 --> 01:47:58,450
Your mother and sister
will get their cheque on Monday.

916
01:47:58,689 --> 01:48:02,022
- This isn't his apartment.
- You did well.

917
01:48:02,259 --> 01:48:05,353
No one here will live long.
It's an AIDS hospice.

918
01:48:05,596 --> 01:48:10,659
...with a reciprocal and immediate violence...
- My opinion? It's a con.

919
01:48:10,901 --> 01:48:13,301
I have been forced to do this.

920
01:48:13,537 --> 01:48:17,940
It is the hope and specific goals
of my administration

921
01:48:18,208 --> 01:48:22,474
- to reform these brutal methods...
- Get him off the podium.

922
01:48:22,713 --> 01:48:26,479
- To participate in the formation...
- We've got to go.

923
01:48:26,717 --> 01:48:28,810
But I want to speak!

924
01:48:37,928 --> 01:48:40,192
Come on, sir, run!

925
01:49:00,117 --> 01:49:01,709
He's OK.

926
01:49:01,952 --> 01:49:04,352
- Cover here. I'll take the hall.
- Where's Keller?

927
01:49:04,588 --> 01:49:06,021
Freeze!

928
01:49:17,167 --> 01:49:20,568
Incredible. Thank God I looked up.

929
01:49:20,804 --> 01:49:23,238
- He's from our mission.
- I know who he is. Holster your weapon.

930
01:49:25,676 --> 01:49:27,974
Dr. Zuwanie.

931
01:49:29,379 --> 01:49:31,404
I remember the last time you were here.

932
01:49:31,682 --> 01:49:37,314
<i>- Use the 42nd Street exit.
- We almost had an assassination here.</i>

933
01:49:37,554 --> 01:49:39,146
<i>Please move...</i>

934
01:49:39,389 --> 01:49:42,916
We watched you on the telly back home.

935
01:49:43,193 --> 01:49:47,789
My family. All the families.
You were like the Beatles.

936
01:49:48,031 --> 01:49:52,229
Two or three more seconds, I would
have been too late; he almost assassinated him.

937
01:49:52,469 --> 01:49:55,632
<i>An almost-assassinated leader
gets so much credibility</i>

938
01:49:55,873 --> 01:49:59,775
<i>so he can stay in power
and gets to stick around to enjoy it.</i>

939
01:50:00,010 --> 01:50:02,774
We were so proud of you.

940
01:50:04,781 --> 01:50:08,717
There you were, speaking to the world.

941
01:50:11,822 --> 01:50:14,416
I don't think you should touch...

942
01:50:16,226 --> 01:50:18,217
Because I'm not wearing a glove?

943
01:50:18,495 --> 01:50:21,225
What is your name, child?

944
01:50:23,400 --> 01:50:25,766
I'm the Silvia whose family you killed.

945
01:50:27,571 --> 01:50:30,438
- What's in your hand?
- It's... Just a precaution.

946
01:50:30,674 --> 01:50:35,304
What's in your hand?
He must've been very surprised.

947
01:50:35,546 --> 01:50:37,776
He thought it was a live round.

948
01:50:40,183 --> 01:50:43,118
- Where is everyone?
- But you knew better.

949
01:50:52,863 --> 01:50:54,262
Give me the live round.

950
01:50:57,100 --> 01:51:02,367
I grew up seeing you with this gun.
It's the gun you saved our country with.

951
01:51:02,606 --> 01:51:04,972
- Drop the gun!
- Put it down!

952
01:51:05,208 --> 01:51:07,369
Keller, US Secret Service.

953
01:51:08,278 --> 01:51:11,577
It's the same one you used to kill it.

954
01:51:11,815 --> 01:51:15,717
- He's got a Glock on his hip.
- Code 100 in the sound room.

955
01:51:23,760 --> 01:51:25,159
Look at it.

956
01:51:30,167 --> 01:51:31,498
Look at it!

957
01:51:36,373 --> 01:51:40,833
- Careful. The bleeder is an AIDS patient.
- There's no way you can prove any of this.

958
01:51:41,111 --> 01:51:44,046
You'll cop a plea.
You're just an employee, right?

959
01:51:44,281 --> 01:51:48,547
- He's in custody. They're bringing him down.
- SWAT team's at 42nd Street.

960
01:51:50,020 --> 01:51:52,215
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. Where's Zuwanie?

961
01:51:52,456 --> 01:51:55,084
- The safe room. What happened?
- It was a fake.

962
01:51:55,325 --> 01:51:59,523
A piece of theatre to justify the killing.
Ethnic cleansing, genocide.

963
01:51:59,763 --> 01:52:02,960
You there? That's the flight.
She's not on it.

964
01:52:03,200 --> 01:52:05,725
I checked every hotel in New York,
every friend she's got.

965
01:52:05,969 --> 01:52:08,938
They don't know where she'd go.
No one knows her.

966
01:52:09,206 --> 01:52:12,300
- I know her.
- OK, where is she?

967
01:52:12,542 --> 01:52:15,705
<i>- She said she was going home.
- I'm going home...</i>

968
01:52:15,946 --> 01:52:17,277
What home? Where?

969
01:52:17,514 --> 01:52:21,450
<i>- How'd you happen to be there after hours?
- An evacuation. I left some things.</i>

970
01:52:21,718 --> 01:52:24,551
<i>It takes too long...
I wouldn't mind if he were gone.</i>

971
01:52:24,788 --> 01:52:27,222
She's here.
She's been in that room all night.

972
01:52:27,457 --> 01:52:31,723
How could someone so good, so...

973
01:52:32,863 --> 01:52:35,491
How could you give us so much,

974
01:52:36,667 --> 01:52:38,066
so much...

975
01:52:40,037 --> 01:52:42,096
then take away more?

976
01:52:43,573 --> 01:52:46,667
- He in there?
- Yeah.

977
01:52:48,679 --> 01:52:50,977
Keep everybody out.

978
01:52:52,082 --> 01:52:54,073
Silvia?

979
01:52:54,351 --> 01:52:55,511
<i>Silvia?</i>

980
01:52:57,254 --> 01:52:59,484
<i>It's me.</i>

981
01:52:59,723 --> 01:53:02,658
I'm coming in alone. I'm coming in.

982
01:53:04,494 --> 01:53:06,621
Five minutes.

983
01:53:11,234 --> 01:53:13,930
Close it.

984
01:53:14,171 --> 01:53:17,868
- Close it!
- Silvia, don't do this.

985
01:53:18,108 --> 01:53:22,511
It was all just a piece of theatre,
an almost-assassination meant to justify his acts.

986
01:53:22,746 --> 01:53:26,238
- We've got all we need to prosecute.
- I have him.

987
01:53:26,516 --> 01:53:29,952
- He'll die in prison.
- I want him to die the way Simon died.

988
01:53:30,220 --> 01:53:33,781
That'll be over in two seconds,
and you'll have all your years.

989
01:53:34,024 --> 01:53:37,858
Sir, it's a lot worse than you think it is.
Your so-called assassin is dead.

990
01:53:38,095 --> 01:53:40,655
Your head of security
is gonna make a deal.

991
01:53:40,897 --> 01:53:44,833
We have Lud and the rifle.
You'll be tried before two courts.

992
01:53:45,102 --> 01:53:48,003
- He's been tried!
- Sir, you're finished.

993
01:53:48,238 --> 01:53:53,471
- It doesn't matter!
- Silvia. Listen to me.

994
01:53:53,710 --> 01:53:56,338
I told you I'd let him drown.

995
01:53:56,580 --> 01:53:59,845
The man who drove my wife
into a bridge abutment.

996
01:54:02,052 --> 01:54:04,987
- But I wouldn't.
- Then you'd be wrong.

997
01:54:05,222 --> 01:54:10,091
No, I wouldn't be wrong. I don't want
to spend the rest of my life in mourning.

998
01:54:21,671 --> 01:54:24,333
You have to get out of here.

999
01:54:24,574 --> 01:54:28,010
I can't do that. So put the gun down.

1000
01:54:29,079 --> 01:54:32,480
- I can't.
- Yes, you can. Put it down.

1001
01:54:32,749 --> 01:54:36,048
I can't! I can't... I can't.

1002
01:54:36,753 --> 01:54:38,414
Just go.

1003
01:54:52,803 --> 01:54:55,135
This is how it's done.

1004
01:55:03,346 --> 01:55:05,780
This is how you put a gun down.

1005
01:55:17,027 --> 01:55:18,824
Please.

1006
01:55:21,064 --> 01:55:24,431
You shoot him, he'll be dead...

1007
01:55:26,937 --> 01:55:29,565
...but then you'll be dead...

1008
01:55:31,775 --> 01:55:34,505
...and I don't know what I'll be.

1009
01:55:40,217 --> 01:55:42,378
Put it down.

1010
01:55:45,355 --> 01:55:47,255
Read it!

1011
01:55:48,391 --> 01:55:50,086
Read it.

1012
01:55:51,228 --> 01:55:54,322
- Where?
- The beginning. Read it.

1013
01:56:01,171 --> 01:56:05,574
- "The gunfire around us... "
- Louder. Like when you wrote it.

1014
01:56:06,877 --> 01:56:09,710
When you believed it.

1015
01:56:09,946 --> 01:56:11,971
When you meant it.

1016
01:56:17,087 --> 01:56:22,684
"The gunfire around us makes it hard to hear. "

1017
01:56:25,128 --> 01:56:31,033
"But the human voice
is different from other sounds. "

1018
01:56:34,771 --> 01:56:40,266
- "It can be heard...
- "It can be heard over...

1019
01:56:40,543 --> 01:56:45,378
over noises that bury everything else. Even...

1020
01:56:47,050 --> 01:56:51,009
- "Even...
- "Even when it's not shouting. "

1021
01:56:51,288 --> 01:56:53,688
"Shouting. " "Even when it...

1022
01:56:53,924 --> 01:56:57,758
"Even if it's just a whisper. "

1023
01:57:02,532 --> 01:57:08,437
"Even the lowest whisper
can be heard over armies...

1024
01:57:09,706 --> 01:57:11,230
"When...

1025
01:57:13,410 --> 01:57:17,813
- "When...
... "when it's telling the truth. "

1026
01:57:36,599 --> 01:57:39,227
That little boy was my country.

02:00:53,229 --> 02:00:56,630
We never had time for a lot of things.

1057
02:01:01,638 --> 02:01:05,039
You don't have anyone left there, do you?

1058
02:01:05,308 --> 02:01:07,640
No, it's where I remember them.

1059
02:01:12,315 --> 02:01:14,875
Ever been to Africa?

1060
02:01:16,819 --> 02:01:19,014
Lot of airports, no lions.

1061
02:01:26,462 --> 02:01:29,397
- When are you leaving?
- Tomorrow.

1062
02:01:31,401 --> 02:01:32,925
Wow.

1063
02:01:37,674 --> 02:01:40,609
<i>Hey, look at this.
We're not kepéla any more.</i>

1064
02:01:43,179 --> 02:01:45,511
We're on the same side.

1065
02:01:47,617 --> 02:01:51,576
You never know
who you're going to meet, do you?

1066
02:01:51,854 --> 02:01:53,549
No.

1067
02:01:56,593 --> 02:01:58,788
Will you let me know how you are?

1068
02:02:08,371 --> 02:02:10,896
You'll always know.

1069
02:02:25,622 --> 02:02:27,522
What was her name?

1070
02:02:31,794 --> 02:02:33,785
Laurie.

1071
02:02:35,331 --> 02:02:37,094
Keller.

1072
02:02:41,271 --> 02:02:45,002
Killed in an auto accident in Santa Fe...

1073
02:02:46,309 --> 02:02:48,300
...23 days ago.

1074
02:03:00,990 --> 02:03:03,151
Rest in peace?

1075
02:03:05,995 --> 02:03:07,724
Close enough.

1076
02:03:45,689 --> 02:03:52,689
