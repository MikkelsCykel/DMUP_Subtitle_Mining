(Man 2) Give me that.
Don't make me lose money, bruv.

00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,839
Hold it, hold it. Hold that shit.
I said hold that shit!

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,439
(Man 2) Look at his eyes, bruv.
Look at his eyes.

00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,199
(Man 1) All right, bruv, let it go.

Fuck you right up.

00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,839
Yeah.

37
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,679
(Woman) No!

38
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,639
(Youth cackles)

39
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,959
(Gunshot)

40
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,079

This is fucking brilliant!

41
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,279

42
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,280

00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,440
(Youth 2) Fucking hell. Let's go!
Fucking... I fucking shot her, man!

44
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,080
(Tyres screeching)

45
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,999
(Man on radio)
..Exactly what she looks for in a man.

46
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Tall, dark and mysterious
or just plain loaded?

47
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,599
(Woman) I'm not telling you.
You're a cheeky sod.

48
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,279
(Man) Thank you very much.
Here's the news.

49
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,879
(News signature tune)

50
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,880
Good morning, this is Clare Miller
with your early morning news update.

51
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,040
FormerMP Alan Peters will begin his
three-year sentence for fraud, today.

52
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,159
Peters was convicted
back in September

53
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,160
and will serve at least
18 months in Ford Open Prison.

54
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,879
Labour spokesman, Lindsay Rhodes,

55
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,999
said the party
had nothing more to say

56
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,479
of what was a sordid and sorry case.

57
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,839
Single mother, Karen Dobbs,

58
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,559
was shot yesterday
in front of her two-year-old son.

59
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,279
A police spokesman says Miss Dobbs

60
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,280
was a victim of a random
and senseless act of violence.

61
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,519
The toddler will be placed
in the care of a local authority.

62
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,520
Traffic now, the M25 is closed
eastbound at junction 19

63
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,879
due to an overturned
heavy-goods vehicle.

64
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,880
Traffic police are advising all drivers
to avoid the area.

65
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,639
That's it for now,

66
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,159
I'll be back in half an hour
with a further traffic update.

67
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,999
(News signature tune)

68
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,759
(Man) Thank you very much.
That was Claire Miller with the news.

69
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,679
Lisa, where were we, brain or brawn?
What are you looking for in a man?

70
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,159
(Lisa) Oh, I'd have to say
brain everytime, Johnny.

71
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,199
(Johnny) Damn.

72
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,599
(Harry grunts)

73
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,600
(Inhales)

74
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,560
(Exhales)

75
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,480
(Screaming)

76
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,160
(Shouting)

77
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,120
(Door closing)

78
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,199
(Traffic)

79
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,200
(Loud music from underpass)

80
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,159
Morning, Sister.

81
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,319
How is she today?

82
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,999
She's had a difficult night.

83
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Oh.

84
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,039
Hello...

85
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:15,040
Kath, my love.

86
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,959
Same again, Harry?

87
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,960
Yeah, cheers.

88
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,800
Make it two, Sid.

89
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,319
One for my father, here.

90
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:25,320
Thanks, Harry.

91
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,359
Everything all right, Len?

92
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,360
Fine.

93
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,720
How's your Kath?

94
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,960
I don't think she knows I'm there, any more.

95
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,279
She knows.

96
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,280
(Door opens and closes)

97
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,079
All right, Ken? Got a twenty bag, yeah?

98
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,439
Yeah.

99
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,440
(Kenny snorts)

100
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,560
Nice one.

101
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,479
- Did you see that?
- What?

102
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,480
They don't even try to hide it now.

103
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,639
I found a needle in the toilets last week.

104
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,559
You think Sid would say something.

105
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,959
What's he gonna do, eh,
call the police?

106
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,479
Bollocks.

107
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,480
Besides, Kenny What's-his-name
slipped him a bung.

108
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,640
- Sid? No.
- Yeah, I've seen them at it.

109
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,040
That Sid is not who you think he is,
and the other one,

110
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,319
he's into selling drugs, guns,
under-age girls, the lot.

111
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,320
Christ, Len, why don't you
say that a bit louder?

112
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,799
(Game show on television)

113
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,879
(Man) You've got Cooking
or Geography?

114
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,319
(Woman) Cooking, Dave.

115
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,320
(Dave) Cooking it is.
This should be a piece of cake.

116
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,520
Fingers on buzzers,
here's the first course. Start the clock.

117
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,799
Chanterelle...

118
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,800
(Banging)

119
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,159
- (Car alarm)
- (Man shouting)

120
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,160
(Youths shouting)

121
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,079
(Man) Stay there, in the house.

122
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,080
(Shouting)

123
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,640
(Shouting and arguing)

124
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,080
(Glass smashing)

125
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,640
(Woman screams) Oi! Get off him!
You animals, get off him!

126
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,040
(Youths shouting)

127
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,959
(Woman) Help! Can somebody help me?

128
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,919
Can you phone the police, please?

129
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,920
(Car alarm continues loudly)

130
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,520
(Woman sobbing)

131
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,360
(Woman) Can you phone the ambulance?!

132
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,760
(Begging) Please, phone the police.

133
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,920
(Phone ringing)

134
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,360
Hello?

135
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,440
(Loud talking from the underpass)

136
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,840
(Pants)

137
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:13,080
(Sobs)

138
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,400
Bob Creswell.

139
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,479
Big Scottish bloke.

140
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,480
We were in the marines together.

141
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:53,120
If it hadn't have been for him,
I wouldn't have met my Kath.

142
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,480
It was a service dance,
and Bob's dancing with this girl...

143
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,920
And...I dunno, I...

144
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,759
I see this...

145
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,760
pretty pair of eyes...

146
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,120
..and I guess we just
liked the look of each other, so...

147
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,920
I cut in on Bob,

148
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,199
and Kath and me,

149
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,200
we spent the rest of the night
dancing together.

150
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,840
You've never really talked
about your time in the marines.

151
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,240
Your Kath told me
you had a couple of medals somewhere.

152
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,320
Did you ever kill anyone?

153
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,040
You can't ask me that, Len.

154
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,199
I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have said anything.

155
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,119
It's all right. It's OK.

156
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,120
- I didn't mean to upset you.
- OK. Forget it.

157
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,960
The marines were a lifetime ago.
I was...I was a different man then.

158
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,520
When I met my Kath I knew that all that stuff
had to be locked away.

159
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,759
I made that decision,
all those years ago,

160
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,760
and I stuck to it.

161
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,680
Harry...

162
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,679
I'm scared, Harry.

163
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,680
I'm...I'm scared all the time.

164
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,040
They pushed dog shit
through my letter box.

165
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,320
One of 'em spat in my face.

166
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,440
They call me, er...

167
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,439
You know the ones.

168
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,440
I'm not gonna take it any more.

169
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,520
God in heaven.
What are you doing with that?

170
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,800
- You know what.
- Len, no.

171
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,719
- I thought you'd understand.
- I do.

172
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,119
You should talk to the police.

173
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,120
I tell you what, we'll go together.

174
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,160
I've already been to the police.

175
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,800
(Door slamming)

176
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:12,080
(Coughs)

177
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,079
(Gasps)

178
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:18,080
(Chokes)

179
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,160
(Coughs and sputters)

180
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,519
Bastards!

181
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,520
(Len) You fucking bastards!

182
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,640
- Mr Harry Brown?
- Yes.

183
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,840
Police.

184
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,640
I'm Detective lnspector Frampton.
This is Sergeant Hicock.

185
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,279
Is there anyone here with you,
Mr Brown?

186
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,280
No, I'm a widower.

187
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,999
What's this all about?

188
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,199
Do you think we could sit down?

189
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,200
Yeah. Yeah.

190
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,679
I'm sorry to have to tell you,

191
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,680
but last night Mr Leonard Attwell
was involved in a very serious incident.

192
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,639
Len?

193
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,640
Wh-Wh-What happened?
Is he all right?

194
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,399
No, I'm afraid not, Mr Brown.

195
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,400
Mr Attwell is dead.

196
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:01,280
Sergeant, could you get Mr Brown
a glass of water, please?

197
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,119
What happened?

198
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:13,120
He was assaulted.
Late last night.

199
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,319
What? Where? Where, at home?

200
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,320
No. He was found
in the pedestrian walkway.

201
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:23,199
(Harry pants)

202
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,200
Thank you.

203
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,719
Did you find out who did it?

204
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:32,720
I'm afraid the investigation's
still in progress.

205
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,559
When did you last see him?

206
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,359
(Harry) Er...

207
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:41,360
Yesterday afternoon, we...

208
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,600
We played...
We played chess in the Barge pub.

209
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,719
(Harry sniffs)

210
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,319
Was he distressed
or concerned about anything?

211
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:54,320
No...Well, you know,
just about the kids on the estate.

212
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,319
(Frampton) Did he mention any names?

213
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:00,279
No. He never...

214
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,559
Just kids.

215
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,560
(Phone ringing)

216
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,919
(Hicock) Hello.

217
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,279
Yeah, great, cheers.

218
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,879
Thanks, mate. Bye.

219
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,159
(Hicock clears throat)

220
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:18,160
If there's anything you can help us with,
Mr Brown, please get in touch.

221
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:21,280
Thank you.

222
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,039
Is there anyone we can call
to be with you?

223
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:27,040
Or I can send Social Services,
if you want?

224
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,079
No, no, no.

225
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,080
I don't need anybody.

226
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,840
I'll be all right.

227
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,599
OK. (Clears throat)

228
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,439
We'll...We'll see ourselves out.

229
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,440
OK.

230
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,920
(Sobs)

231
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,399
(Loud bass music)

232
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,719
(Hicock) Oh! What a shit hole.

233
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,720
You wouldn't want to live round here
if you didn't have to, would ya?

234
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,679
Guv, normally we send uniform
to do the death-o-grams.

235
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,680
There's no need to do it yourself.

236
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,279
Ma'am, can I ask you a question,

237
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,599
and you can tell me
to mind me own business, but erm...

238
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,919
I heard that you requested
to be transferred here.

239
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,920
Cos most of the DI's would
give their right arm to be in fraud

240
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,400
or a cushy number like that,
do you know what I mean?

241
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,119
Sergeant Hicock,

242
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,519
if you refer to a notice of death
as a death-o-gram again

243
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,520
I'll have you reprimanded
before the Superintendent.

244
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,800
(Sighing)

245
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,679
(Sighing)

246
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,680
(Television plays in background)

247
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,079
(Loud banging on door)

248
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:22,080
(Man) Police!

249
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,199
(Loud banging on door)

250
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,200
Come on, open the door,
we've got a warrant.

251
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,879
Jean, you know how this works,
open the door.

252
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,880
Don't make it more difficult
than it has to be.

253
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,159
(Jean) What's all this about?
(Hicock) Where is he?

254
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,039
You're always fucking picking on him!

255
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,599
(Hicock) Noel?

256
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,600
(Shouts) Noel! Sergeant Hicock.
Don't make me come up there!

257
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,719
(Police radio)

258
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,720
Noel!

259
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,320
What's all the fucking noise about?

260
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,559
Who's this, your new bitch?

261
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,679
Noel Winters, I'm arresting you
on suspicion of murder...

262
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,519
I don't know what you're talking about!

263
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,520
Are you reading me my rights?
Think I don't know my fucking rights?

264
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,279
I know them better than you do,
you muggy cunt.

265
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,319
..may be given in evidence.

266
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,079
You get your fucking hands off him!
He ain't done nothing.

267
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,399
Mum, give it a rest, will ya?

268
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,039
(Jean whimpers)

269
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,040
Sergeant Hicock, can I please
speak to my mum? She's upset.

270
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,440
Ma'am?

271
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,199
(Hicock) Yeah, go on then.

272
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,239
(Jean cries)

273
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:48,240
Call my uncle and tell him to
get my brief down the nick, all right?

274
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,359
Come on then, pussy'oles.

275
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,079
(Noel) Watch my fucking arm, cunt.

276
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,799
(Jean) You leave him alone.
This is harassment, this is.

277
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,999
(Woman) About time,
you nasty piece of shit.

278
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,759
Yeah, yeah,
yap, yap, yap you old slag!

279
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:03,760
(All shouting abuse)

280
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:15,120
(Frampton) Noel?
You never asked us that one question.

281
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,039
Yeah? What's that, then?

282
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,319
You didn't ask who you were
supposed to have killed.

283
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,320
(Police sirens)

284
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,080
Tell me about Mr Attwell.

285
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,439
Who's that?

286
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,119
You know, Mr Attwell,

287
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:47,120
the er, nice old man that you and your mates
murdered in the subway.

288
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,280
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

289
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,559
So, Carl...

290
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,999
killing a pensioner,

291
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
it must have been hard work for ya.

292
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,239
(Scoffs)

293
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,240
(Carl) No comment.

294
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,720
No...comment.
It's like a catchphrase, innit?

295
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,919
I know you're scared, Mark,

296
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,679
but I can't help you
if you don't tell me the truth.

297
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,239
I ain't scared.

298
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,240
What truth? I don't know nothing.

299
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,640
(Frampton) Dean?

300
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,039
Dean?!

301
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,599
(Hicock) Earth to Dean!
Hello, mate.

302
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,479
You spend half your life
in that subway

303
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,480
scoring and shooting up,
or whatever it is you do down there.

304
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,319
Come on, mate, tell us what happened.

305
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,999
No comment.

306
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
That's what your solicitor's told you to say
and that's your right,

307
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,799
but if there's something
you don't tell us today,

308
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,800
that you later on decide you want
to use in court in your defence...

309
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,560
(Shouts) Dean, can you hear me?
(Hicock) Dean!

310
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,919
(Dean) No comment.

311
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:11,559
(Frampton) You do know
that the jury will be hearing a list

312
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,079
of all your previous convictions

313
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:16,080
for violence, aggravated assault,
wounding with intent,

314
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,239
possession of a deadly weapon?

315
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,079
It's how it goes, innit?

316
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,399
These days you need protection on the roads.

317
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,400
But tell me something, though...

318
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,039
..when my little brother
got himself cut up,

319
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,999
where the fuck were you lot?

320
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,599
Shining your fucking shoes?

321
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,119
Where I'm from,
someone comes for you,

322
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:41,120
you need to be tooled up
or they're going to fucking merc you.

323
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:45,360
So is that what happened, Carl?
You were just defending yourself?

324
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,399
Did Mr Attwell attack you?

325
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,079
(Frampton) Did he? Was he drunk?
Was he violent towards you?

326
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,719
Hey, tell her, firm, tell her
to shut the fuck up, will you?

327
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,799
Tell us what really happened.

328
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,799
No comment.

329
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,079
(Frampton) Do you realise
how serious this is, Noel?

330
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,080
You could be going to prison
for the rest of your life.

331
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:06,319
Still, you might get to see
a bit more of your old man.

332
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,479
My dad was the fucking king
around that estate,

333
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,519
and you know it.

334
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,759
Really? What's he now,
the king of a bunk bed?

335
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,479
Fuck you.

336
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:16,480
Everybody knows you used to shit yourself
around my old man.

337
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,759
The day you arrested him,

338
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,759
got six of your mates
to put him in the van

339
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,760
while you watched,
like the little pussy'ole that you are,

340
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,239
Sergeant Hicock.

341
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,439
Think you got rid of my old man
offthat estate?

342
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,799
- Yeah.
- Well, you haven't.

343
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:32,800
He's still out there now doing what
he's always done. Do you know how?

344
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,639
I am my old man.

345
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,640
So is every other cunt out there
with one of these, you feel me?

346
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,999
I got fucking rights, you pig cunts.

347
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
If you've got something on me
then fucking charge me. If you don't...

348
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,520
well, you got to let me go, ain't ya?

349
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,719
(Hicock) Did it feel good
sticking it to the old man?

350
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,639
I don't know
what you're talking about.

351
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,319
(Hicock) Oh, I bet it did.
I bet you buzzed off it, didn't ya?

352
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,759
Sticking it to some old codger.

353
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,959
After all, you've had it stuck into you
all your life, haven't you?

354
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,679
What the fuck is he talking about?

355
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,679
I've got a report here
from Social Services, Mark,

356
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,559
that tells me
you've been in and out of foster care

357
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:13,479
since you were six years old.

358
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:16,079
And you've made some pretty
serious allegations of sexual abuse.

359
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,799
That's all bollocks.

360
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,199
I just made all that shit up,
for my own reasons.

361
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,200
No one's ever fucked with me
like that, you get me?

362
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,920
I'm fucking sick of this. I've been
stuck in here for fucking hours now.

363
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,199
You ain't got fuck all on me,
so let me go.

364
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,200
Noel, if you use abusive language
to myself or my colleague,

365
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,039
or threatening behaviour,

366
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,599
I will have you escorted
back to your cell and...

367
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,600
What are they going to do, put me
over the fucking table and spank me?

368
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,400
You'd like that wouldn't you,
you fucking faggot. And you...

369
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:45,559
I'll stick it up your fucking arsehole
and rip your fucking hair out,

370
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,959
and you'll fucking love
every fucking minute of it!

371
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,960
You're the type, I can tell.

372
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:55,239
Noel, I think you think
you're taking control of this situation.

373
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,399
I'll take control of you,
you fucking slag.

374
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,400
It seems to me you're losing control,
you're losing it.

375
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,519
Is that what happened
with Mr Attwell, Noel?

376
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:05,520
- Did you get angry like you are now?
- Is that your training kicking in?

377
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,239
- Did you lose it?
- Are you a fucking psychologist now?

378
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,759
Did you stab him, Noel?

379
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,519
I'll stab you with my fucking cock.

380
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,759
Did you kick him?
Did you piss on him?

381
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,719
Is that what happened?

382
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,720
Hold on,
I have seen this guy before.

383
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,120
Fucking Freddy Krueger, innit?

384
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:00,119
(Priest) ..Our Lord, Jesus Christ.

385
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,959
Who shall change the body
of our low estate,

386
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,960
that it may be likened
to His glorious body.

387
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,079
We give Thee hearty thanks...

388
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,080
(Inaudible)

389
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:29,039
(Woman sings)

390
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:32,040
* I hope you find a little more time

391
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:35,280
* Remember we were partners in crime

392
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,759
* It's only two years ago

393
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:41,760
* The man with the suit and the pace
You know that he was there...

394
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,559
(Harry) And again, Sid.

395
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:47,239
* Now he's in love with you
he's in love with you...

396
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:50,240
Haven't you had enough, Harry?
I don't think I've seen you pissed before.

397
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,719
* But you could leave me
standing so tall...

398
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:56,720
Well, you know,
who's gonna complain?

399
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,039
* You are gold...

400
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:03,040
(Harry) Oh, shit.

401
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,839
* You've got the power to know

402
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,199
* You're indestructible

403
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,200
* Always believe in... *

404
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,480
(Laughter)

405
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,880
(Pants)

406
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,120
Give me your fucking money, man.

407
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,680
Are you fucking deaf?!

408
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:19,280
Give me your fucking money, man!

409
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:22,400
(Harry breathes heavily)

410
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,320
(Harry gasps)

411
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,360
(Harry pants)

412
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:42,320
Mr Brown, DI Frampton.

413
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:47,120
I thought I might drop by for a quick word,
if that's all right?

414
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,959
I'm sorry, is this
an inconvenient time for you?

415
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:52,960
No. Come in.

416
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,480
You were in the marines?

417
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,400
Yes.

418
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:17,119
Long time ago.

419
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:20,120
It's quite a chestful of medals.

420
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,999
Are you in the middle of a game?

421
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,399
No.

422
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,400
Well, actually I'm studying
the Grandmasters.

423
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:37,120
This was a game between Fischer
and Spassky in Reykjavik, in 1 972.

424
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,800
In the 7th match, Fischer opened
with what's called a Pirc defence,

425
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,359
he'd never used it before.

426
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:49,079
Black concedes the centre of the board

427
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:52,080
in expectations of a counter play.

428
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,400
Spassky was a rook to knight up when...

429
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,920
Anyway, Fischer won.

430
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:07,040
You don't have anyone to play with.

431
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:10,560
No.

432
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,720
Not since Len.

433
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,520
You could always get one of those
chess computer game things.

434
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,440
You didn't come here to talk about chess.

435
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,079
No.

436
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:28,080
No, I didn't, I...

437
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,400
I'm looking for some background information
on Mr Attwell.

438
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,320
We recovered the murder weapon
at the scene.

439
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,159
It had Mr Attwell's fingerprints on it,

440
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,719
as well as fibres from his coat,

441
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:46,720
suggesting that the knife
belonged to him.

442
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:50,360
To be precise,
it was an old military bayonet.

443
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,399
Mr Attwell never served in the forces.

444
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,400
No.

445
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,399
You didn't give it to him, did you?

446
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,599
No.

447
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,639
But you knew he had it?

448
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:06,199
Oh yeah, I knew.
I think his dad gave it to him.

449
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:09,200
- He showed it to me.
- When?

450
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,239
The day he died.

451
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:15,119
Now, before you say another word,

452
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,119
he was using it as protection.

453
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:20,120
(Raising his voice) I mean, that man,
he was frightened. Terrified.

454
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,240
These kids on the estate,
they were harassing him.

455
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,959
He came to me and asked me for help.

456
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,119
I said, "Why don't you go
and talk to the police?"

457
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,279
- That was the right thing to do.
- Oh, was it?

458
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,280
He told me he talked to the police
and what did you lot do? Nothing.

459
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,560
Well, that may be true,
but I have a problem.

460
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:38,279
Counsel will argue
that whoever killed Mr Attwell

461
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,559
did so out of self defence,

462
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,319
which means they'll be charged
with manslaughter, not murder.

463
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,320
Jesus Christ.

464
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,720
You came here to tell me that?

465
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:53,680
I just...
I just thought I...

466
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:58,679
should prepare you for what
might end up in court, that's all.

467
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,680
If it ever gets to court.

468
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,400
I won't take up any more of your time.

469
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:22,160
I'll let you know when there's
some further developments.

470
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:54,360
(Voices from the street)

471
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:09,760
(Indistinct)

472
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,960
(Dog barks)

473
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:50,400
(Carl) You look like
a couple of Feds, innit?

474
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:23,520
(Girl screams)

475
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:28,240
(Girl screams)

476
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,599
(Carl) See this thing here, blood?

477
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:37,600
Fucking faggot,
you run for it, you're getting this.

478
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:20,440
(Door being unlocked)

479
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:24,880
(Door slams)

480
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,399
What the fuck do you want?

481
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:36,400
I'd like to do some business.

482
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:50,039
Yeah?

483
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:52,599
I want to do some business.

484
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:55,600
I heard that Kenny, and you,
were the men to see.

485
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:01,360
Well, you better come in then, brother.

486
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:12,240
(Cocks the gun)

487
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,800
Put the fucking gun down, Kenneth.

488
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:21,839
(Kenneth sniffs)

489
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:24,840
(Sighs)

490
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:31,520
So, what do you want?

491
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:34,760
I want what he's got.

492
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,799
I want a gun.

493
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,319
He's not coming any more, Granddad.
It's all over with.

494
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,119
Hitler.
Two world wars and one...

495
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:45,120
Shut the fuck up, Kenneth.

496
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:50,679
What do you want a gun for, brother?

497
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:53,680
I want to shoot the pigeons,

498
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:57,760
off...off my roof.

499
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:03,199
Yeah.

500
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:06,200
Course you do.

501
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:09,760
Course you do.

502
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:13,600
(Sniffs)

503
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:28,680
(Laughs)

504
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,800
(Loud music playing)

505
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:18,760
(Panting)

506
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:27,400
Dirty little fucking bitch.

507
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:36,320
Is...Is she OK?

508
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,879
She's having the time of her life.

509
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:39,999
(Groans)

510
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,000
(Kenny grunts)

511
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,719
Ain't ya baby, eh?

512
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,720
Eh?

513
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:56,560
Ain't ya, Sharon?

514
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,919
Sharon?

515
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:02,639
Sha-ron. Shar...

516
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,599
(Shouts) Sharon! You fuck!

517
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:07,600
(Laughs maniacally)

518
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:14,800
(Sniffs)

519
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:20,440
(Exhales sharply)

520
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:28,599
She, er...

521
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:31,600
She likes to cuddle, this one.

522
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:37,320
Wanna cuddle her, eh?

523
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:40,400
50 quid, all in, you can do
what you fucking want to her.

524
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,520
She won't remember a thing.

525
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:53,040
What's the matter, eh?

526
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:57,120
Can't you get your cock hard
any more, old man?

527
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,359
Is that it?

528
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:03,360
Because we've got plenty
of the little blue tablet there.

529
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:08,800
Just the gun.

530
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:26,320
Take a seat.

531
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:16,560
(Syringe hits the floor)

532
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:23,400
(Breathes deeply)

533
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:41,479
Start you off on a Glock 17, right?

534
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:44,279
Nine-millimetre, semi.
It's easy to load.

535
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:45,639
Easy to shoot.

536
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:48,640
Weapon of choice for every fucking pig force
around the world is that. Have a butchers.

537
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:53,360
Or, Sig P 226, right?

538
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:57,040
That's state-of-the-art, high-tech,
fucking polymer frame

539
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:59,279
reinforced with fibre glass.

540
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:00,719
I don't know what any of that shit means

541
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:03,639
but it looks fucking cool as crap that,
doesn't it? Look at that.

542
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:06,640
Or if you want to get a bit
old school,

543
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:09,559
I've got just the thing for ya.

544
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:12,560
Cool shit, that.
Smith & Wesson snub nosed .38.

545
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:15,319
That's a beautiful little gun
and a proper fucking stopper.

546
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:18,320
You can only have five rounds
in the chamber, can you see?

547
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:20,759
That's because it's a model 36, right?

548
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:23,079
Fuck me, mate,
each one of them packs a wallop

549
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:26,079
like a fucking brick
through a plate-glass window.

550
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:27,599
Ammo?

551
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,879
It's a pound a bullet.
Seven bills for the .38,

552
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:32,199
eight and a halffor the Glock
and a full grand for that Sig there.

553
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:35,200
(Kenny snorts)

554
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:45,759
What the fuck are you doing, man?

555
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:48,760
You don't touch the merchandise
until we've seen some fucking coin.

556
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:51,239
Sorry. I'm sorry.

557
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:54,239
(Kenny snorts)

558
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:57,240
(Sharon moans)

559
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:02,280
Hey, are you sure she's OK?

560
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:03,479
(Snorts)

561
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:06,279
Maybe we should take her
to the hospital?

562
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:08,439
What did you just say?

563
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,359
(Sharon moans)

564
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:13,360
Your girlfriend needs a doctor.
Maybe you should call an ambulance.

565
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:17,559
(Sighs)

566
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:20,560
Ain't no fucking ambulance
gonna come here, brother.

567
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:22,559
Do you understand me?

568
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:25,560
OK. OK, I'll...
I'll mind my own business. All right?

569
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,999
(Sharon moans)

570
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,239
(Rasping) That's fine.

571
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:33,240
She ain't your business.
She's my business.

572
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:37,359
Now you pay for your gun

573
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:40,360
and fuck off
before I hurt you.

574
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:46,960
And you...

575
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:53,840
I'm gonna deal with you later, Kenneth.

576
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:25,480
(Sharon moans)

577
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:29,280
(Sharon coughs)

578
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:38,920
(Coughs)

579
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:44,680
Yeah, so...so you were saying
700 for the .38?

580
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:47,879
- (Kenny) Yeah. (Sniffs)
- Hey.

581
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:50,880
I will say, she's got a nice
little set of tits on her.

582
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,599
But you two are a right pair of

583
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:54,799
- cunts!
- (Kenny whimpers)

584
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:57,800
(Kenny moans)

585
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,839
Look at me.

586
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:07,840
Oh, yeah...

587
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Pigeons.

588
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:21,160
(Gun misfires)

589
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:31,320
(Cries out)

590
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:43,920
(Breathes heavily)

591
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:55,400
(Pants and groans)

592
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:12,800
You failed to maintain your weapon, son.

593
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,000
(Moans)

594
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:25,559
I don't reckon you've got long.

595
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:28,159
I've seen that before.

596
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:29,559
Gut wound.

597
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:31,239
(Moans)

598
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:34,240
The slug's probably torn
right through your liver.

599
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:39,320
Mate of mine in Ulster
got caught in sniper fire.

600
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,319
The bullet blew his inside out.

601
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:45,959
(Moans and breathes hard)

602
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:48,960
He screamed for a good ten minutes.

603
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:53,560
You couldn't send a medic in,
the section was too hot.

604
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:01,440
So, we all took cover...

605
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:06,600
and watched him die.

606
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,359
I've never told that

607
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:16,360
to anyone.

608
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:26,720
You should have called an ambulance
for the girl.

609
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:40,760
(Quietly) Put you in here. Ah!

610
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:06,440
Blimey!

611
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:46,840
Linda, would you get me a coffee, please?

612
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,000
I understand things are going rather slowly
with the stabbing of the pensioner?

613
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:58,160
You're aware of the shooting
on Curzon Street, two dead?

614
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:01,720
As of now,
we're forming Operation Blue Jay.

615
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:04,920
We'll take a zero-tolerance stand
on gun-related violence.

616
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:08,159
We're gonna come down quick and hard
on the criminal gangs

617
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:10,799
that control the flow of heroin
on the estate.

618
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:13,800
I have spoken to Division
and they concur.

619
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:17,640
I'll be leading the squad on this one.

620
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:21,720
There'll be a full briefing.
I expect you and DS Hicock to attend.

621
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:26,120
The death of your pensioner will have to go
on the back burner for a while.

622
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:30,800
Thank you, Linda.

623
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:34,400
That'll be all, lnspector.

624
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:45,120
(Birds chirping)

625
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:18,960
None of it makes any sense.

626
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:20,599
You shot two drug dealers,

627
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:23,600
you don't risk being identified
by driving this girl to a hospital.

628
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:27,399
She had that thousand pound
in cash on her,

629
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:29,959
I thought,
she must be one of the gang.

630
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:31,599
What gang?

631
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:34,600
- Well, Superintendent Childs...
- Superintendent Childs?

632
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:09,760
(Youths shouting and laughing)

633
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:18,000
(Indistinct conversations)

634
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:51,800
- Money.
- All right, Troy?

635
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:54,919
Where's the rest of it?

636
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:57,679
- Coming, yeah?
- Don't talk to me like I'm a cunt.

637
01:00:57,680 --> 01:01:00,559
(Indistinct)

638
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:02,919
That fucking uncle of yours
took a ton of gear off me,

639
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:05,559
and now he's gonna pay up.

640
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:08,560
We're going to pay you, man.

641
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:12,080
He's got one week. One fucking week.

642
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:14,999
Or I'm going to burn that shit hole of his
down, with him still in it.

643
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Fuck off.
Marky, get in the car.

644
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:23,200
Marky, get in the fuckin' car!

645
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,639
(Heavy breathing)

646
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:49,640
(Man moans) Yeah.

647
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:57,360
(Climaxes)

648
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:12,120
Fuck off.

649
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:18,600
(Marky) Oh, fuck!

650
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Shit.
Wait. Fucking wait.

651
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:25,320
(Marky cries)

652
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:41,200
What's your name, son?

653
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:47,039
Tell me your name.

654
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:49,599
Marky.

655
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:52,600
Tell me what happened
in the subway with Leonard, Marky.

656
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:55,879
(Marky sobs)

657
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:58,880
Who's Leonard?

658
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:02,400
He's the man
you and your mates murdered.

659
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:09,280
So, what happened, son?

660
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:12,520
You're chatting shit there, bruv,
I don't know what you're talking about.

661
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:19,480
(Sobs)

662
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:22,959
Tell me what happened to Leonard.

663
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:25,519
Fuck off.

664
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:27,039
(Marky screams in pain)

665
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:28,479
(Crying) Fuckin' hell.

666
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:30,959
You tell me the truth...

667
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:33,199
- ..and I won't hurt you any more.
- Fuck off, all right?

668
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:36,200
Fucking Jesus!

669
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:39,479
(Marky cries)

670
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:42,359
(Marky, quietly) Fucking Jesus.

671
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:44,359
Oh fuck, no way.

672
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:47,360
Now, listen, if you won't tell me,

673
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:50,600
I'm gonna do both your knee caps,

674
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:54,159
one at a time until you do.

675
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:56,119
(Sobbing) Fucking...

676
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:59,120
So, what's it gonna be?

677
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:02,159
Because I don't think
you can take much more of this.

678
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:05,079
All right,
there was this one old fella...

679
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:08,080
Fucking...

680
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:11,079
But he come at us, man.

681
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:14,080
He was waving this
fucking shank around and shit.

682
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,399
Fucking...

683
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:18,999
Fuck, he told us
he was gonna stab us.

684
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,199
We told him to fuck off, like,

685
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:24,079
gave him a chance,
but he wouldn't go.

686
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:26,159
Then what?

687
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:29,160
Fucking, just gave him
a couple of slaps, that's all, man.

688
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:34,119
He had this fucking big shank, man.
He was mad.

689
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:36,079
What makes you think
I should believe you?

690
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:37,399
Fuck it, I couldn't give a shit.

691
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:39,799
- Well you should...
- Oh, fucking hell.

692
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:42,479
..if you ever want to walk again.

693
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:44,439
(Spits) Fuck off!

694
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:46,079
Fuck off.

695
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:47,399
Fuck.

696
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:50,400
Oh, fuck.

697
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:51,999
Oh, fucking wait.

698
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,599
- What the fuck?
- Goodbye, Marky.

699
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:56,600
No, I got the whole fucking thing
on my phone.

700
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:01,399
- You what?
- Oh fuck. I'm sorry, man.

701
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:04,400
- We was just retaliating, bruv.
- Where's the phone?

702
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:06,519
In my pocket.

703
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:09,520
(Marky sobs)

704
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:15,280
Go on, make it work.

705
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:21,120
(Shouting and jeering from phone)

706
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:32,040
(Indistinct shouting)

707
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Calm down, bruv.

708
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:42,719
(Girl screams)

709
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:44,359
(Shouting continues)

710
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:47,360
(Youth) Right, kill him, man.

711
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:51,279
(Youth) Kill that pensioner, blood.

712
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:54,280
(Commotion)

713
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:20,199
(Marky sobs)

714
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:23,200
Fuck, I'm sorry.

715
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:27,880
We just meant to shit him up.

716
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:32,920
It wasn't me that stabbed him.

717
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:36,800
Who did?

718
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:41,399
So ain't no one warned you about me, no?

719
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:44,400
- No.
- You think you're a big girl?

720
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:48,440
Yeah?

721
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:57,879
(Giggling)

722
01:06:57,880 --> 01:06:59,519
(Carl) Come on, tease me.

723
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:02,520
(Carl) Feel my gun.

724
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:29,159
(Noel) Carl.

725
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:32,160
(Carl) What?

726
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:37,520
Get the fuck out of here.

727
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:56,480
(Sobbing) Get out. He's got a gun.

728
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:01,879
Who's got a fuckin' gun?

729
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:03,919
(Guns being cocked)

730
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:06,920
(Marky cries)

731
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,599
Who's got a fuckin' gun?

732
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:22,879
Boys, please.

733
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:25,880
Don't fucking shoot, man.

734
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,399
Wait, please.

735
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:33,400
Fuck.

736
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:48,559
Fuck this.

737
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:51,560
(Marky) Fucking hell, Carl!
Wait! Fucking hell!

738
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:55,240
Fucking wait!

739
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:23,840
Fuck!

740
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:34,840
(Harry breathes heavily)

741
01:09:39,360 --> 01:09:40,879
(Harry gasps)

742
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:43,880
(Harry struggles for air)

743
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:54,240
(Harry gasps)

744
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:05,600
(Harry groans)

745
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:29,400
(Hicock) Mr Brown, can you hear me?

746
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:36,479
Do you remember me?
I'm Sergeant Terry Hicock.

747
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:39,480
I'm sorry, sir, I've got to ask you
a couple of questions, is that OK?

748
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:44,800
Did you see anyone on the canal tow path?

749
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:50,280
(Hicock) No. Are you sure?

750
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:53,999
Er, excuse me?

751
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,879
If you want to interview Mr Brown
then you'll have to come back.

752
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:58,999
He's not well enough
to answer your questions.

753
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,879
(Frampton) No, of course.

754
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:04,799
- What exactly is wrong with Mr Brown?
- Emphysema.

755
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:07,800
For more information
you'll have to speak with the doctor.

756
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:11,600
Oh, wait.

757
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:15,439
Here, sorry.

758
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:18,440
Thank you.

759
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:22,360
So much for our witness.

760
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:26,320
Where was he found?

761
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:38,080
Listen, ma'am, we're gonna be late
for this briefing.

762
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:42,719
Is this exactly
where Mr Brown was found?

763
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:45,720
Yes, ma'am. Uniform said he had trouble
breathing and couldn't answer questions.

764
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:49,800
- Did they search him?
- Search him for what?

765
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:57,879
What do you think he was doing here?

766
01:11:57,880 --> 01:12:00,880
Taking a piss. Walking his dog.

767
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:08,480
I smelt cordite on his coat.

768
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:13,920
Right, look, I'm sorry, ma'am, but, er...
the Super's briefing started 15 minutes ago

769
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:17,600
and we're supposed to be there.

770
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:26,560
(Indistinct conversations)

771
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:38,799
Apologies, sir.

772
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:41,279
I have 13 warrants to execute on the estate.

773
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:43,199
I hope your witness was worth it.

774
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:45,839
Er, the witness proved, erm, unreliable, sir.

775
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:47,879
Claims not to have seen anything.

776
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:50,880
Pity.

777
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:54,840
Sir, I don't think Harry Brown is a witness.

778
01:12:55,160 --> 01:12:56,959
I think he's our chief suspect.

779
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:58,279
I'm sorry, I was under the impression

780
01:12:58,280 --> 01:13:01,079
uniform found an elderly gentleman
on the tow path.

781
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:03,439
Yes, that's right,
that's correct, sir.

782
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:05,679
Mr Brown
is a close friend of Leonard Attwell,

783
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:08,680
the senior citizen found
stabbed in the pedestrian subway.

784
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:11,960
It's the same pedestrian subway
where last night's shooting took place

785
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:15,440
and both victims were questioned
in connection with Mr Attwell's death.

786
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:17,799
It's too much of a coincidence

787
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:20,359
that Mister Brown just happened
to be found so close by.

788
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:21,479
So, what you're telling me is

789
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:24,480
this escalating violence
is down to a vigilante pensioner?

790
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:26,119
Yes.

791
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:27,879
Do you have any evidence to support that?

792
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:29,719
Not at the moment,
but I'd like to get a warrant

793
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:32,720
so I can have Mr Brown's clothes
tested for gunfire residue.

794
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:34,439
Where is Mr Brown?

795
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:37,440
He's in the hospital, sir.
He's having trouble breathing.

796
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:40,760
Emphysema.

797
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:45,559
Also, Dean Saunders was found
on that canal stabbed to death.

798
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:47,999
He too was questioned by myself
and Hicock and then released.

799
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Did you know that Troy Martindale
was shot in his car last night?

800
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:53,599
Martindale was a major heroin importer.

801
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:56,479
Two of Martindale's associates
who operate out of Curzon street

802
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:58,359
were also shot dead a week ago.

803
01:13:58,360 --> 01:13:59,679
Neither of whom you've questioned

804
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:01,999
in connection with the killing
of this old man in the subway.

805
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,759
Of course, you'd have known all this
if you'd been at the briefing.

806
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:07,239
He was with the Royal Marines,
stationed in Northern Ireland.

807
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:09,999
I had the MOD
send me his old service record.

808
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Terry, give us a minute, please?

809
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:19,919
I've had a request from Division.

810
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:21,679
They're looking for an experienced officer

811
01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:24,439
to head up a major inquiry
into identity theft.

812
01:14:24,440 --> 01:14:27,440
Your background
makes you the perfect candidate.

813
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:31,080
I've recommended you
and they've accepted.

814
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:34,920
Take the weekend for yourself, Alice.

815
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:38,600
Good luck.

816
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:03,600
(Indistinct conversations)

817
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:21,440
(Police radio)

818
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:36,360
(Police radio)

819
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:56,880
(Police radio)

820
01:15:56,920 --> 01:15:59,920
(Police shouting)

821
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:09,360
(Man) Fuck off.

822
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:13,359
(Officer) Give me your other arm!

823
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:15,879
(Woman) Oi, fuck off!

824
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:18,880
(Officer) Move out.

825
01:16:21,720 --> 01:16:24,720
(Officer 2) I'll get you. Come here!

826
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:28,320
(Officer 3) Get on the fucking floor!
(Officer 4) Show me your hands!

827
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:32,679
(Youth) Fucking, pricks! Fuck off!

828
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:34,399
(Youth 2) Get off me!

829
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:37,400
(All shout abuse)

830
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:44,320
(Shouting and commotion)

831
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:05,600
(Police radio)

832
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:32,759
(Flatline beep)

833
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:34,039
(Police sirens)

834
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:37,040
(Officers shouting orders)

835
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:55,000
(Officer) Visors down!

836
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:03,640
(Cheering)

837
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:33,560
(Nurse) Mr Brown?

838
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:37,519
Mr Brown, please.

839
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:40,520
Mr Brown!

840
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:45,080
(Mob shouting and jeering)

841
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:49,839
(Officer) Petrol bomb!

842
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:52,840
(Officer 2) Get down, incoming!
(Officer 3) Move back!

843
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:49,000
I'm really sorry.

844
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:53,439
Do you really think
Mr Emphysema's got it in him

845
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:56,440
to top a load of hoodies?

846
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:01,800
I've just spoken to the hospital.

847
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:05,160
He's discharged himself.

848
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:09,200
Well, we're off the case now,
thanks to you.

849
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:16,600
I think he's going to the estate.

850
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:22,000
I think he's going to kill Noel Winters.

851
01:20:22,120 --> 01:20:24,359
Who gives a fuck if he is?
Noel Winters is a cunt.

852
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:27,360
His dad was a cunt.
One day he's gonna have loads of cunty kids.

853
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:30,600
As far as I'm concerned,
Harry Brown's doing us a favour.

854
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:42,119
(Hicock sighs)

855
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:45,120
Come on then.

856
01:21:17,560 --> 01:21:20,560
(Youth) You fucking bastards.

857
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:28,959
Oh, fucking hell.

858
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:31,960
(Tyres screeching)

859
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:36,360
(Hicock) Shit!

860
01:21:47,080 --> 01:21:50,080
(Coughs)

861
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:54,360
(Frampton grunts)

862
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:12,040
(Banging on door)

863
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:17,160
Sid. It's me. It's Harry.
Open the door, mate.

864
01:22:18,160 --> 01:22:21,160
(Police sirens)

865
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:23,959
(Harry strains)

866
01:22:23,960 --> 01:22:26,960
Move that table,
I want to put him in the corner.

867
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:30,600
(Harry) That's it.
Get an ambulance.

868
01:22:33,160 --> 01:22:36,160
Don't move, son.
He'll be all right.

869
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:39,560
- Get an ambulance!
- Yeah, I'll, er...

870
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:48,120
(Sobs)

871
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:54,560
You all right, love?

872
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:12,800
(Youths whooping outside)

873
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,999
It's not Northern Ireland, Harry.

874
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:20,000
No, it's not.

875
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:24,200
Those people
were fighting for something.

876
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:27,999
For a cause.

877
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:31,000
To them out there,
this is just entertainment.

878
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:39,800
But where does it end...hm?

879
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:44,320
(Sniffs)

880
01:23:44,360 --> 01:23:47,360
You shoot Noel for what he did to Leonard
and then Sid shoots you?

881
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:52,999
Sid?

882
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:56,000
What's Sid got to do with it?

883
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:03,480
Sid Rourke's Noel Winters' uncle.

884
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:16,000
(Frampton sobbing)

885
01:24:26,640 --> 01:24:29,640
(Dialing tone)

886
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:34,840
(Harry laboured breathing)

887
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:47,799
Not looking too good there,
me old son.

888
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:50,199
Where's Noel,

889
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:53,200
Uncle Sid?

890
01:25:05,640 --> 01:25:08,640
(Mobile phone rings)

891
01:25:13,160 --> 01:25:16,160
Get out here, Noel.

892
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:22,079
(Sid) Put that down!

893
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:24,999
Fuck that. This senile old cunt
killed Marky and Carl.

894
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:28,000
I told you to put it down.

895
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:34,359
Come on, Harry.

896
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:37,360
You're not going to shoot a kid
when there's two coppers upstairs, are ye?

897
01:25:37,880 --> 01:25:40,880
- He killed Leonard.
- He swore to me that he didn't.

898
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:42,479
Now what am I supposed to do?

899
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:45,480
- He's my sister's boy. He's blood.
- Blood?

900
01:25:47,400 --> 01:25:50,400
Do you want to see Leonard's blood?

901
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:53,520
These fucking animals

902
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:56,600
filmed the whole thing
on their fucking phones.

903
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:11,799
All right.

904
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:14,800
I defended him when I shouldn't have,
but I can't let you shoot him, Harry.

905
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:17,880
I can't have that.

906
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:25,440
(Harry struggles to breathe)

907
01:26:26,920 --> 01:26:29,920
Are you all right, Harry?

908
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:37,800
Are you OK, me old mate?

909
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:05,760
(Harry moans)

910
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:14,239
(Door closing)

911
01:27:14,240 --> 01:27:17,240
Officers need assistance.

912
01:27:17,320 --> 01:27:20,320
Armed response, come in.
Over.

913
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:23,359
What are you drinking there, love?

914
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:24,759
(Noel) Eh?

915
01:27:24,760 --> 01:27:26,159
You fucking slag.

916
01:27:26,160 --> 01:27:28,839
Fucking dirty bitch, look at me.

917
01:27:28,840 --> 01:27:30,319
Look up.
Fucking sket.

918
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:33,320
I told you I'd fuck you, didn't I?
You fucking cunt.

919
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:38,440
(Harry moans)

920
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:41,520
(Grunts)

921
01:27:41,720 --> 01:27:42,759
You see this?

922
01:27:42,760 --> 01:27:44,479
This is the sort of thing
I'm talking about.

923
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:46,519
It's not a fucking game.

924
01:27:46,520 --> 01:27:49,520
Now in future,
you do as you are fucking told!

925
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:52,800
Yeah?

926
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,239
OK. We do them in here.

927
01:28:03,240 --> 01:28:04,319
Dump them on the street.

928
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:07,320
That way it'll look like
they got caught in the shit storm.

929
01:28:09,640 --> 01:28:12,640
He's half done already.

930
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:17,480
(Hicock kicking against the floor)

931
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:26,840
(Hicock still kicking)

932
01:28:30,440 --> 01:28:32,919
(Moans)

933
01:28:32,920 --> 01:28:35,920
(Kicking slows down)

934
01:28:44,440 --> 01:28:47,440
See that?
It's nice and easy.

935
01:28:52,040 --> 01:28:53,999
Turn over, you fucking slag.

936
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:57,000
Come on.

937
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:00,239
Look at me.

938
01:29:00,240 --> 01:29:02,079
(Choking)

939
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:05,080
Go on, fucking look at me.

940
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:08,360
I'll be the last fucking thing
you see when you die.

941
01:29:11,080 --> 01:29:14,080
(Exhales) Go on, struggle.
Struggle. Go on.

942
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:23,000
(Noel) Go on.

943
01:29:45,680 --> 01:29:48,680
(Coughs)

944
01:29:49,240 --> 01:29:52,240
(Frampton gasps)

945
01:29:54,280 --> 01:29:56,719
Go on. Do me a favour.

946
01:29:56,720 --> 01:29:59,720
Pull the trigger.

947
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:03,359
(Officer) Do you have a clear target?

948
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:06,360
(Indistinct radio response)

949
01:30:07,640 --> 01:30:09,199
Do it.

950
01:30:09,200 --> 01:30:12,200
Please.

951
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:26,840
(Frampton cries)

952
01:30:43,160 --> 01:30:45,279
(Childs) Following the findings
of the enquiry

953
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:48,280
concerning the aftermath
of Operation Blue Jay.

954
01:30:48,640 --> 01:30:51,359
The ruling of the committee
commend not only myself,

955
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:53,639
but other members of the squad.

956
01:30:53,640 --> 01:30:56,640
In particular,
Detective Sergeant Terry Hicock,

957
01:30:57,160 --> 01:31:00,160
who having tragically lost his life
in the line of duty

958
01:31:00,320 --> 01:31:03,320
has been singled out for
the Queen's Gallantry Medal for Bravery,

959
01:31:04,120 --> 01:31:07,120
along with fellow officer
Detective lnspector Alice Frampton.

960
01:31:08,120 --> 01:31:10,399
(Reporter) Can you confirm
or deny the rumours

961
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:13,400
that a number of deaths on the estate
are attributed to a vigilante?

962
01:31:14,520 --> 01:31:17,520
Both the findings of the committee
and the police investigation

963
01:31:18,120 --> 01:31:20,359
have found no evidence
to support such a theory.

964
01:31:20,360 --> 01:31:23,360
And, can I just say
on a personal note, Martin,

965
01:31:25,080 --> 01:31:26,759
that type of wild speculation

966
01:31:26,760 --> 01:31:29,119
undermines the work of the police force

967
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:32,120
and ultimately does a disservice
to members of the public who support it.

968
01:31:35,440 --> 01:31:37,479
Now, as I made clear many months ago

969
01:31:37,480 --> 01:31:40,480
we operate and apply a zero-tolerance policy

970
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:42,959
with reference to criminal activity

971
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:45,960
involving firearms
and the distribution of drugs.

972
01:31:46,240 --> 01:31:47,679
Most important,

973
01:31:47,680 --> 01:31:49,919
the findings
suggest that crime on the estate

974
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:52,759
has declined by almost 30 percent.

975
01:31:52,760 --> 01:31:55,039
With continued help from members
of the community,

976
01:31:55,040 --> 01:31:57,439
we hope to eradicate the criminal element
