You keeping busy?

30
00:02:56,809 --> 00:02:58,071
Yeah, I've been busy.
You know.

31
00:02:58,111 --> 00:03:00,136
-Busy doing what?
-Busy in the garden.

32
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,740
In the garden. You know what?
You're missing work. That's what.

33
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:04,306
-I can see that.
-No, I'm not missing work.

34
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:08,377
Yeah, you're missing the buzz and
the jokes and the guys. I know that.

35
00:03:08,421 --> 00:03:10,753
-Don't tell me that's not true. Yeah.
-Maybe a little.

36
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,417
Are you gonna buy some meat
or what?

37
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,653
Yeah, I'm gonna buy some meat.
I'm looking at some meat right now.

38
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:17,857
-I want to get some real good steak.
-I got a special here on the rump.

39
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:19,194
Forget the specials.

40
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:22,429
I got the children visiting me
this weekend from all over the country.

41
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:24,663
Got them all around the same table,
all 4 of them.

42
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:29,773
<i>Clean up aisle 5.</i>

43
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:31,071
<i>Clean up aisle 5, please.</i>

44
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:37,479
Excuse me.
Do you know about these wines?

45
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:39,985
-The wine? These wines?
-Yeah.

46
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,885
I stock this section.
Why? Is there a problem?

47
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:47,819
No, I just wanna get some expensive
bottles of wine for my children.

48
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:52,456
-This isn't for children.
-I know it's not for children.

49
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:54,261
It's for my children
that aren't children anymore.

50
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,758
What would be the best one...
Ones of this?

51
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:02,307
Well, we got wines
from all over the world.

52
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:05,743
We got English wines,
you know, from France.

53
00:04:05,778 --> 00:04:09,612
We got Italian wines
from all over Europe.

54
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:12,613
I wanna make a good impression
on my kids.

55
00:04:13,052 --> 00:04:14,883
You will. Definitely.

56
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:16,712
It's got a built-in
tenderizing gauge

57
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:19,122
for steaks and poultry
with 7 different grades.

58
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:23,353
And there's an automatic spritz
to calm flames if the oil catches.

59
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:26,422
It is guaranteed for 5 years
with a premium protective seal.

60
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:28,195
It has an automatic rotisserie,

61
00:04:28,234 --> 00:04:31,362
and when the lid is closed,
the oxygen's reduced to a level

62
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:34,134
that does not support
or encourage the fats to ignite.

63
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,566
Yeah.

64
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:39,006
-Is that what it's going for?
-648. That's the sale price.

65
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:42,913
That's a heck of a deal for this model.
That's as low as I can go.

66
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:47,451
-How about 6?
-Done. Sure. Absolutely.

67
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:50,149
-Where do I...
-You can just put it right in there.

68
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:53,659
-Looks like somebody's having a party.
-Yeah, it's just the family.

69
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:19,818
-Hello?
-Dad, it's Robert.

70
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:20,876
Robert.

71
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,150
Dad, listen,
things aren't looking very good...

72
00:05:28,594 --> 00:05:31,085
-Sorry.
-Well, that's a shame.

73
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:33,030
That's a real shame.

74
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:37,127
Yeah, you're gonna miss out
on having some fancy wine

75
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:40,734
-and filet mignon steak and...
-Have you heard from the others?

76
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:43,205
Yeah, so far all of them are coming.

77
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:45,472
Some Friday night,
some Saturday morning.

78
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:50,041
-I'm sorry again, Dad.
-Yeah, I'm sorry, too, Rob,

79
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,210
but you gotta get back
to that orchestra, Son.

80
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:56,119
-I will. You take care. Okay.
-Okay. You take care, too. Okay.

81
00:05:56,989 --> 00:05:58,115
Okay.

82
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:22,776
Dad, hi. I can't stop right now.
I'm back on stage in a few minutes.

83
00:06:22,815 --> 00:06:27,149
The producers are flying in from Paris
and wanna see the original cast,

84
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:30,087
so I just can't get away this weekend.

85
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:34,356
I'm sorry. I know I haven't been home
since the funeral,

86
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:39,161
but I'm trying, I promise. I love you.
I'm thinking of you.

87
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:40,597
Big kiss.

88
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,994
Hey, Dad. It's Amy.

89
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:46,370
I'm really sorry to have to do this,

90
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:49,239
but things have just gotten really crazy
at the agency

91
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:53,075
and Jack's sick with a fever.
He missed school today.

92
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:54,909
So between one thing and another,

93
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:57,438
we're not gonna be able to make it
this weekend.

94
00:06:57,483 --> 00:06:59,383
I'm really sorry, Dad.

95
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,382
And to make things worse,

96
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:06,449
I spoke to David today,
and he can't make it, either.

97
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:09,484
He's got a lot going on,
a painting or something, but...

98
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:13,623
Anyway, I promise
we'll make it to you soon. Okay?

99
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:16,000
Love you.

100
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:29,438
Well, you can't.

101
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:31,245
You can't just go flying
all across the country,

102
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:34,151
-not in your condition.
-Who said anything about flying?

103
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:36,747
What about buses? What about trains?

104
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,279
I'm worried about your lungs, Frank.

105
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:40,349
Don't worry about my lungs.
Worry about your lungs.

106
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:41,587
My lungs are fine.

107
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:44,528
Fibrosis of the lungs requires you
to take things easy.

108
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:45,656
Now, you know that.

109
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:48,599
I'm just going on the buses,
on the trains...

110
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:51,034
You picked the wrong job, Frank.
I mean,

111
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:54,003
breathing in humidified PVC
all those years...

112
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:59,233
You know, it's just about seeing
the family. You know, I...

113
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:03,006
Jean always kept in touch
with everybody, and now it's...

114
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,509
You know how it is.
Now it's down to me.

115
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:09,250
-How are you managing on your own?
-I'm fine.

116
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:12,257
-You're fine? Yeah, fine?
-Fine, yeah. I'm fine.

117
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,953
You know, when I lost my wife,

118
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:18,896
I found myself talking to her
like she was still there.

119
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:20,330
It went on for months.

120
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,464
"Where the hell are my shorts?"

121
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:27,136
No, no. There's nobody there.
No. Talking to myself.

122
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:29,069
Crazy?

123
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:32,476
-You do that, Frank?
-No.

124
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:35,777
-No? No?
-Not yet.

125
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:39,283
Look, I hear what you're saying, I do,
but this trip,

126
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:42,912
it's not what you need right now.
You gotta take things easy.

127
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:45,285
You do. Stay home.

128
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:49,760
You know what you should do?
Spend more time in the garden.

129
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:57,125
Ed said it was fine.

130
00:08:58,237 --> 00:09:03,265
He said just take enough medication
and stick to trains and buses.

131
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:08,541
And I'll take plenty of pictures,
and I'll bring home the news.

132
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,074
I'll start with David in New York.

133
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:16,413
And if anything goes wrong,
I'll be right home.

134
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:23,759
Got my keys, got my wallet.

135
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:29,700
My keys, got my medication.

136
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,368
Camera.

137
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:37,131
Got my keys.

138
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:03,801
Next.

139
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:05,963
New York City. One way, please.

140
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:11,437
-$87.
-$87. There's 100.

141
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:15,443
-I'm going to see my son.
-Very good.

142
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:18,878
-You know what he does?
-Absolutely no idea.

143
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:21,148
-He's an artist.
-Gate 7. Thank you.

144
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:22,620
-Next.
-Thank you.

145
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,007
What do you think of my work?

146
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:48,979
You've been looking at it
ever since we left the station.

147
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:51,640
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

148
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:53,675
No, don't look at me.
Look back out the window.

149
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:55,084
Tell me what you see.

150
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,418
-Cars?
-No.

151
00:10:58,124 --> 00:11:00,684
-Trees?
-Well, yes, but no.

152
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:04,594
Houses?

153
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:07,559
Just remember that
you've been looking at it

154
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,094
-ever since we left the station.
-The window. The glass?

155
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:15,107
No. Not bad, but it's a start... But...

156
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:19,601
-Birds?
-No. Not birds.

157
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:28,544
-Rocks?
-Not rocks. No, that's ridiculous.

158
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:30,782
Rocks! You're just guessing.

159
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:33,348
I'm gonna stick with this lady here.
I think she has an idea.

160
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:35,292
No, honestly,
I really have no idea what you mean.

161
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:37,352
You know, just look for the rhythm.

162
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,958
-The telephone poles?
-Close. Close.

163
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:47,837
-The wire?
-Yeah. Keep going. Keep going.

164
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:50,467
-Really, I give up.
-No, no. Okay. That's it. That's it.

165
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:51,567
The wire, that's good.

166
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,441
I mean, I didn't make the wire,
I didn't hang the wire,

167
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:56,812
but I coated the wire.
I protected it with PVC coating

168
00:11:56,849 --> 00:12:00,182
against the rain, the moisture, heat,
stuff like that.

169
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:04,121
So, what you actually see
is not the wire. It's my PVC coating.

170
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:07,353
I ran 1,000 miles of wire a week,
non-stop.

171
00:12:08,293 --> 00:12:09,861
Non-stop.

172
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:10,987
If you just think for a minute,

173
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:14,329
all the conversations
that have taken place over that wire.

174
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:16,800
Breaking good news and bad news.

175
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,231
Yeah.

176
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:24,268
-I'll show you something.
-Sure.

177
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:28,269
These are my children.

178
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:31,106
Robert, the conductor.

179
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:36,912
David, the artist. Rosie, the dancer.
Amy, very high up in advertising.

180
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:40,521
A million feet of wire
to get them where they are today.

181
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:43,623
-It's a nice picture.
-Thank you.

182
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:47,995
Million feet of wire
to get them where they are today.

183
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:55,733
-Rocks?
-Yeah, right. That's right. Rocks.

184
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:02,937
They were all...
They were all supposed to visit me,

185
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:05,573
and we were gonna have
a family reunion,

186
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:08,746
and instead they all canceled on me
at the last minute.

187
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:20,524
You lock yourself out, honey?

188
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:24,121
No, I didn't lock myself out.

189
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:26,757
My son lives here.
I'm just waiting for him.

190
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:29,934
You can come wait with me if you want.
I know a place.

191
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:31,664
Thank you.
That's nice of you, though.

192
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,194
-You sure?
-Thank you.

193
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:34,638
You wanna see my leg?

194
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:38,473
You wanna see mine?

195
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:01,390
-Come on.
-Are we here?

196
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:02,730
Man.

197
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:05,760
-Dude, I can't believe you, man.
-What?

198
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:08,539
I can't believe you, all night...

199
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:48,509
David.

200
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,750
What are you gonna do
when you grow up?

201
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:01,889
I wanna be a painter
and do my pictures.

202
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:04,054
No, not a painter.
Christ, painters paint walls,

203
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:07,065
and dogs pee on walls.
You're gonna be an artist.

204
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:09,795
Artists paint pictures
that change people's lives.

205
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:11,393
-So what are you gonna be?
-An artist.

206
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:14,201
That's right, an artist.
So, you gonna work hard?

207
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:15,297
Yes, Dad.

208
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:18,071
You gonna make me proud?
I'm trying, Dad.

209
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,652
<i>Unfortunately, it's going to be</i>

210
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:40,995
<i>on top of the coast sometime tomorrow.</i>

211
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:45,732
<i>Right now, Hurricane Alice is packing
winds of 165 miles per hour.</i>

212
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:48,831
<i>We've got a Category 5 hurricane.
The pressure...</i>

213
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:50,364
Looks like a bad storm.

214
00:16:52,543 --> 00:16:54,535
A bad storm.

215
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:56,537
I'm 94.

216
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:00,049
-I keep away from the doctors.
-Boy.

217
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:04,184
I have 3 children, 6 grandchildren.

218
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,018
They're busy.

219
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:09,027
They're too busy to talk to me.
I gotta make an appointment.

220
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:13,795
They got lost someplace.
They don't need anybody.

221
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:17,965
People changed, life is changed.

222
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,167
Today, you shake hands
with somebody,

223
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:24,039
you gotta count your fingers
to make sure you got 5 fingers back.

224
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:40,952
-Hi.
-Hi.

225
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:43,086
-Can I help you?
-Do the bells work?

226
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:44,390
Yeah.

227
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:48,332
My son lives in apartment 9.
I'm not sure if he's home.

228
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:50,563
-All right.
-Thank you.

229
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:30,000
David?

230
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:26,193
<i>Through my sleepless days
I found</i>

231
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:30,523
<i>That in my dreamless sleep I'm bound</i>

232
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:35,429
<i>To one night hear the sound</i>

233
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,109
<i>Of you calling</i>

234
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:42,172
<i>Do not stumble through tonight</i>

235
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:44,874
<i>Have no fear of falling</i>

236
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:49,643
<i>We won't stumble through tonight</i>

237
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:52,853
<i>Drowning in their laughter</i>

238
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:02,194
Amy, it's Rosie.

239
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:07,128
-Dad's not answering his phone.
-Well, don't call him.

240
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:09,037
Not till we know what's going on
with David.

241
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:11,907
-Is there any more news?
-No.

242
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:15,505
I just had that one call from Mexico
saying he'd been arrested.

243
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,947
I keep leaving messages,
but no one's calling back.

244
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:19,575
I think we should tell Dad.

245
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:21,586
Not until we know what's going on.

246
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,247
Just avoid talking to him
for a couple of days

247
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:26,724
-till we know the facts, okay?
-Okay.

248
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:44,804
-My God!
-Surprise.

249
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:46,970
Yeah, definitely. Come on in, Grandpa.

250
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:54,914
-Man, does Mom know?
-No, I hope not.

251
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,687
Well, hey, look at you.

252
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:58,383
I thought you were supposed to be
in bed with a fever.

253
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,448
-I don't know, am I?
-That's what she told me.

254
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:02,426
Yeah, I think I was...

255
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:05,555
-It's got a handle.
-Of course it's got a handle.

256
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:07,895
-I didn't know that.
-It's got wheels.

257
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,397
-Yeah. Look how big you got.
-I know, right?

258
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:16,166
-Gee.
-Hey, listen. I'm online.

259
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:19,041
-I'll be back in a minute.
-All right. You do your thing.

260
00:21:20,245 --> 00:21:22,679
-Mom's out back.
-Okay, good.

261
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,749
No, I need to get down there. Yeah.

262
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:32,355
Can you check out some flights
and see what's available?

263
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:43,164
Amy!

264
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:46,502
Dad?

265
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:53,869
What are you doing here?

266
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:55,436
What do you mean,
what am I doing here?

267
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,947
Everybody didn't show up for the visit.

268
00:21:56,982 --> 00:22:00,076
So I said, "If you don't come to me,
I'm gonna go to you."

269
00:22:00,118 --> 00:22:01,983
You crazy man.

270
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,215
Look at you. You haven't been well.
You shouldn't be traveling.

271
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:06,053
-Did you check with the doctor?
-I checked with the doctor.

272
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:08,389
-You checked with him?
-Of course I checked with the doctor.

273
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:10,588
-Jeff home?
-No, not yet.

274
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:13,394
Let me find out
when he's coming back.

275
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:18,629
So everybody dropped out of the visit?
I didn't realize. I had no idea.

276
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:22,965
How did you get here?

277
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,306
-You didn't fly, did you?
-No, of course I didn't fly.

278
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,902
I took a train to New York to see David,

279
00:22:26,945 --> 00:22:29,277
and he wasn't there
so I took a bus here.

280
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:33,343
-You took a bus? To Chicago?
-Yeah. All by myself.

281
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:37,981
-My God. I can't believe it!
-Yeah. Jack got better fast.

282
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:41,987
Yeah, no, he did.
Definitely, it was a 24-hour thing.

283
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:47,927
I like the house.

284
00:22:47,966 --> 00:22:50,366
-Yeah? But you've seen pictures.
-I've seen pictures.

285
00:22:50,402 --> 00:22:52,700
I haven't seen the house,
not the real thing.

286
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:55,901
-Hey, everyone.
-Hey, Jack.

287
00:22:56,608 --> 00:22:58,269
-How's it going?
-Good.

288
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:01,871
Jack, why don't you take Grandpa
outside and show him your golf?

289
00:23:01,913 --> 00:23:04,780
-You play golf?
-Sure, I'm a natural.

290
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,318
-Yeah, I'd like to see that.
-You wanna see that?

291
00:23:07,352 --> 00:23:09,582
-Where are you hitting it?
-To that flag over there.

292
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:13,284
All the way out there?
Oh, boy. Okay.

293
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:15,425
-My record's 3.
-3?

294
00:23:17,028 --> 00:23:19,826
I'll believe that when I see it.
Come on, let's go.

295
00:23:19,865 --> 00:23:21,332
-You watch.
-Okay.

296
00:23:29,474 --> 00:23:30,702
Not bad.

297
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:35,378
-Beat that.
-I'll beat that, easily, but...

298
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:36,805
All right.

299
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:40,783
Now I'll just have to show you
a few things.

300
00:23:42,287 --> 00:23:46,587
Yeah, that was good,
but not good enough. Frank, the pro.

301
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,951
-Come on, Tiger Woods.
-You ready?

302
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:55,162
-Take your time.
-Okay, ready? Yeah.

303
00:23:57,268 --> 00:24:00,301
-Shit! Sorry.
-What was that?

304
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:02,006
Shot that...

305
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,372
That was just a practice shot.
Give me another one of those.

306
00:24:04,409 --> 00:24:06,036
I'm going after this.

307
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:11,209
Here we go.

308
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:15,845
Shit! Christ! Sorry.

309
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:19,189
-You hit the spice garden.
-One more. Come on.

310
00:24:19,224 --> 00:24:20,623
This is the last one. Come on. This is...

311
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:22,490
I'm your guest. One more. Let's go.

312
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:24,825
Come on. One more. One more.
Let's go.

313
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:26,228
-This is my last one.
-One more.

314
00:24:26,264 --> 00:24:27,925
-Don't lose this one, too.
-Give me another ball.

315
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:29,593
Put it down. Be a sport.

316
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:31,534
-I wanna watch this baby fly.
-Ready?

317
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:33,832
-Ready?
-Impress me.

318
00:24:37,942 --> 00:24:42,138
Shit. Damn. Fucking Christ.
Sorry. Sorry.

319
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:47,379
Can you just...
Yes, Chinese food would be fine.

320
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:51,116
No, of course not.
No, he doesn't know anything.

321
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:54,188
So, I hear you're doing
very well at school.

322
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:57,454
-Nah, not really.
-What do you mean "not really"?

323
00:24:57,496 --> 00:25:00,260
Your mother says
you're at the top of your class.

324
00:25:00,298 --> 00:25:02,027
-Does she?
-Yeah.

325
00:25:05,203 --> 00:25:08,536
-You have to work hard at school.
-Yeah, I know.

326
00:25:09,741 --> 00:25:12,608
I'll tell you what I used to tell
your mother when she was your age.

327
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:14,976
About being the best
and getting to the top?

328
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:18,813
-That's right.
-Yeah, she warned me about that.

329
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:39,394
-Jeff's home.
-Okay.

330
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,980
-Hey, Frank.
-Hi, Jeff.

331
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:53,277
What's all this? Come here, come here.

332
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:57,484
-Surprise.
-Big surprise. Big surprise.

333
00:25:57,522 --> 00:26:00,491
-Look at you. You're looking so well.
-You, too.

334
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:01,651
It's good to see you.

335
00:26:03,161 --> 00:26:05,125
My God! What a day!

336
00:26:05,163 --> 00:26:07,757
You don't wanna know.
I'm sorry I'm so late.

337
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:10,233
-Can you believe this?
-Can I believe it?

338
00:26:10,268 --> 00:26:12,759
Well, nothing surprises me
about this guy.

339
00:26:15,006 --> 00:26:16,769
Well, the place
was really crowded today.

340
00:26:16,808 --> 00:26:19,572
I can't believe
I was able to get out of there alive.

341
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,809
Don't just eat your rice.
Make sure you eat your chicken.

342
00:26:22,847 --> 00:26:23,871
Okay?

343
00:26:44,035 --> 00:26:45,559
Let me get you a fork.

344
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:47,833
You don't know how to use chopsticks?

345
00:26:47,872 --> 00:26:49,499
Yeah, I can use them.

346
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:52,339
I can use them to beat you at golf,
that's how well I can use them.

347
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:54,345
-You like making fun of me, don't you?
-Yeah, you're funny.

348
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:56,540
-Yeah, I'm funny?
-Try this.

349
00:26:57,682 --> 00:27:00,014
Thanks. A fork. A regular fork.

350
00:27:00,051 --> 00:27:02,884
Now I can eat without dropping this
all down my shirt.

351
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:06,188
Jack, can you pass Dad the chili sauce,
please?

352
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:09,120
Jack?

353
00:27:17,702 --> 00:27:18,999
No.

354
00:27:19,037 --> 00:27:21,301
-Jack, pass him the sauce.
-I'm not passing anything.

355
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:22,363
Don't be silly.

356
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:24,967
I don't really want it. It's fine.
I don't need it.

357
00:27:26,678 --> 00:27:28,646
-You sure?
-Stop asking him.

358
00:27:29,014 --> 00:27:31,812
He's not stupid.
If he says no, he means no.

359
00:27:32,517 --> 00:27:34,314
If he changes his mind,
he knows where it is.

360
00:27:34,352 --> 00:27:36,820
-He can get it himself.
-Jack.

361
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:42,224
-I'm sorry, Dad.
-That's okay.

362
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:51,392
So, what are your plans?

363
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:58,035
Well, I thought that I would stay
a day or 2 or so,

364
00:27:58,076 --> 00:28:01,739
and then head on out to see Robert.
Surprise him on his tour.

365
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:07,443
That would have been so great.
It's just, this week's really difficult.

366
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:11,820
I feel awful. I got this huge pitch
to oversee at the agency,

367
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:14,450
and Jeff's flying out
on business tomorrow.

368
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:19,223
We should arrange it properly,
another time.

369
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:22,522
Well, maybe I can just spend time
with Jack?

370
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:26,867
Yeah, that would have been great, too,
but he starts school again tomorrow,

371
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:30,033
and then he's off on
a field trip for 3 days.

372
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:33,511
-A field trip? Where are you going?
-I don't know.

373
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,604
Nobody tells me anything anymore.

374
00:28:37,849 --> 00:28:39,009
Well, you know, look,

375
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:41,314
that's what happens
when you show up unexpectedly.

376
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:45,721
I understand. You're busy. That's fine.
Look...

377
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:51,728
God, I feel awful.
Any other time but this week.

378
00:28:51,763 --> 00:28:55,324
Listen, I've had a good time.
I've seen the house.

379
00:28:55,366 --> 00:28:57,163
I've seen Jeff and you,

380
00:28:57,635 --> 00:29:01,435
and I let this guy beat me at golf,
so all in all it's been a pretty good trip.

381
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:03,668
-I'm really sorry, Dad. Really.
-No.

382
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:06,768
I'm gonna call Robert tonight
and find out where he's gonna be at.

383
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:09,211
I just... He's really busy.

384
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:11,511
He's on tour, and I just don't know
if it's gonna be possible. What?

385
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:14,484
No, don't call him,
because I wanna surprise him.

386
00:29:15,653 --> 00:29:17,746
-Okay.
-Promise?

387
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:20,053
Yeah, promise. Absolutely. Yeah.

388
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,067
<i>I'm putting Dad on the train tomorrow.</i>

389
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:35,629
He'll be with you in Denver
the next morning.

390
00:29:35,673 --> 00:29:38,733
What? No, I'm rehearsing.
I haven't got time to meet him.

391
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:39,835
Well, he can't stay here!

392
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:42,210
I need to get on a flight to Mexico
to see what's going on with David.

393
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:43,908
Is he okay?
Have you spoken to him?

394
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:46,781
No, but I got through
to the police today.

395
00:29:46,818 --> 00:29:48,911
No surprise.
They said the arrest was drug related,

396
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:50,750
but they won't give me
any more details over the phone.

397
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:53,053
So I'm gonna try
and get on a flight tomorrow.

398
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:55,355
Amy, listen, I don't know
if I can lie to Dad

399
00:29:55,393 --> 00:29:57,020
about David when he gets here.

400
00:29:57,061 --> 00:29:59,894
Well, just make up an excuse
to get him to Rosie's.

401
00:29:59,931 --> 00:30:03,628
Say you're flying off to Europe
for a concert or something.

402
00:30:03,668 --> 00:30:05,533
That's too obvious.
I'm not gonna do that.

403
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:08,835
-Well, think of something yourself!
-Are you okay?

404
00:30:23,621 --> 00:30:25,179
Jeff, come on!

405
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:33,161
Jeff, come on.
Dad's waiting to take a photo!

406
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:35,894
Just get it out,
and I'll look at it when I get there.

407
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:39,062
-All right. Okay, bye.
-I'll take one of you two first.

408
00:30:39,437 --> 00:30:42,964
-Okay.
-All right. Here?

409
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:45,472
Little over this way.

410
00:30:46,477 --> 00:30:49,139
Okay. Little...

411
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:55,118
Together. Everybody together.
Together.

412
00:30:56,921 --> 00:30:59,981
-Where's the...
-It's the silver button on top.

413
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:02,925
-My God. This is film. This is great.
-Smile.

414
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:04,394
Watch your finger.
Your finger's on the edge.

415
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:08,456
Yep. Okay! Give me a beautiful...
All right.

416
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,166
You said Jack was
at the top of his class,

417
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:16,196
-but he says he's not doing that well.
-Well, he was at the top of his class.

418
00:31:16,274 --> 00:31:19,368
He's struggling at the moment,
that's all.

419
00:31:21,746 --> 00:31:23,577
I tell you the good news
and spare you the bad.

420
00:31:23,615 --> 00:31:25,583
Isn't that what Mom used to do for you
when we were kids?

421
00:31:25,617 --> 00:31:27,744
It doesn't matter what your mother did.

422
00:31:27,785 --> 00:31:30,117
Tell me the bad news
as well as the good news from now on.

423
00:31:30,154 --> 00:31:31,849
-Do you understand?
-Fine.

424
00:31:34,592 --> 00:31:36,117
You doing okay at home?

425
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:37,923
-You doing okay at home?
-Fine.

426
00:31:37,962 --> 00:31:39,361
-You sure?
-Yeah.

427
00:31:40,531 --> 00:31:41,896
Are you sure?

428
00:31:43,167 --> 00:31:46,227
I didn't realize there was
so much to do around the house.

429
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:48,703
Mom would have loved
to hear you say that.

430
00:31:49,507 --> 00:31:50,735
Yeah.

431
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:54,644
What was all that at dinner last night
with the chili sauce?

432
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:58,978
Jeff just doesn't let Jack
get his own way all the time, that's all.

433
00:31:59,017 --> 00:32:00,279
They always fight.

434
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:05,718
I checked the train times.
There's one in a few hours.

435
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:08,089
I just gotta drop by the office first.

436
00:32:08,626 --> 00:32:10,821
-Advertising?
-Advertising agency, yeah.

437
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:14,320
-Your agency?
-Part mine.

438
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:30,103
Amy. Wait, wait, wait.

439
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:33,880
To your left a little.
To your left, to your left.

440
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:36,717
-Okay.
-One more. It's okay.

441
00:32:37,388 --> 00:32:38,650
Just hold on.

442
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:41,352
-A little to your left. Left, left, left.
-I'm so sorry.

443
00:32:41,392 --> 00:32:42,723
That's it.

444
00:32:44,195 --> 00:32:46,390
-I got it. Yeah.
-You got it?

445
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:49,491
Yeah, no, that's a fish.
It looks great.

446
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:50,558
It looks good.

447
00:32:50,601 --> 00:32:52,466
-I think it works perfectly...
-So remind me of the market.

448
00:32:52,503 --> 00:32:55,802
Yep. It's home owners,
blue collar to middle class.

449
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,037
-Like my dad.
-I guess, yeah. Sure.

450
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:01,307
-I guess.
-Just like your dad. Sure.

451
00:33:01,946 --> 00:33:03,811
So, pitch it to him.
Let's see what he thinks.

452
00:33:03,848 --> 00:33:05,679
Hey, Dad. Come over here.

453
00:33:05,717 --> 00:33:07,810
-Right now? Sure.
-Yeah.

454
00:33:07,852 --> 00:33:10,320
-Hey. Tom.
-Tom? Hi, Tom. Frank.

455
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:12,619
-Frank, I'm Steph.
-Steph?

456
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:15,387
-Hi, Dad. "Dad" 'cause of...
-Hi. Frank.

457
00:33:15,426 --> 00:33:18,486
We got a TV commercial.
They're gonna pitch it to you. Okay?

458
00:33:18,596 --> 00:33:20,393
-To...
-Sit down.

459
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:22,026
-Sit here?
-Yeah.

460
00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:24,031
-In your chair?
-Yeah.

461
00:33:24,902 --> 00:33:27,700
-Now you're in charge.
-Nice chair.

462
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:31,470
Okay, so it's an ad for TV,
for a financial organization...

463
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:34,376
-Yeah, don't tell him. Just pitch it.
-I'm so sorry.

464
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:38,041
Okay. So there's a guy by the lake,
and he is fishing just like this.

465
00:33:38,282 --> 00:33:41,046
Pine forests.
Snow-covered mountains.

466
00:33:41,085 --> 00:33:44,714
And he's wearing a quilted jacket
'cause, you know... It's, like, really cold.

467
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:46,553
What do you do when it gets cold?
Put a quilted jacket on.

468
00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:48,855
-He's a little nippy.
-A couple layers.

469
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:51,889
Okay, here we go.
Big fish jumps out of the water.

470
00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:54,523
I'm talking a big mother
with big beady eyes.

471
00:33:54,565 --> 00:33:57,261
-Kind of looks like... Right?
-Just like that.

472
00:33:57,301 --> 00:33:59,496
Looks at the guy, right in the eyes,
and he says,

473
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:03,997
"Hey, brother, you looking for me?"
Voice over.

474
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:06,976
"Ever wonder why life wasn't this easy?

475
00:34:07,011 --> 00:34:11,038
"At Crest and Landing, transferring
multiple loans to one company

476
00:34:11,082 --> 00:34:13,277
-"can be this easy."
-Okay.

477
00:34:13,317 --> 00:34:15,547
We cut to a shot right here of this guy
by a campfire.

478
00:34:15,586 --> 00:34:18,783
We see that big fish right above
some coals, right? Close-up of the fish.

479
00:34:18,823 --> 00:34:21,053
Boom, right there! As he says,

480
00:34:21,692 --> 00:34:25,150
"Hey, buddy, I'm done on this side.
Wanna turn me over?"

481
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:27,495
That's...

482
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:29,796
-You like it?
-Yeah, it's funny.

483
00:34:29,834 --> 00:34:31,495
It's funny.
The fish talking, it makes me laugh.

484
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:32,696
Yeah, it's funny. It's very funny.

485
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,864
Fish usually don't talk. That's why it's...

486
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:38,865
The fish with the face and the voice.
It looks like a fish. You look like a fish.

487
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:42,345
My God, I just said that to him yesterday.
That he looked like...

488
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,245
His mom looks like a flounder.

489
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:47,547
-What was it for?
-What, the fish?

490
00:34:47,952 --> 00:34:50,682
-No, the spot. What was it selling?
-Yeah, the loans.

491
00:34:51,189 --> 00:34:52,850
That...

492
00:34:53,691 --> 00:34:56,489
It's... Transferring the loans
to another company,

493
00:34:56,527 --> 00:34:58,324
it's as easy as getting
the fish out of the water.

494
00:34:58,362 --> 00:35:00,887
Good. So, does the client like it?

495
00:35:01,132 --> 00:35:03,692
-Likes it, but doesn't wanna go with it.
-Why not?

496
00:35:03,734 --> 00:35:08,262
They feel uncomfortable about saying
that it's easy to transfer your debt.

497
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,831
-Because...
-Because it's not.

498
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:12,866
-It's actually a nightmare.
-It's, like, really hard.

499
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:14,741
-It's like an impossible dream.
-It's like sudoku.

500
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:17,475
Okay, but he's not paying us
to advertise the fact

501
00:35:17,515 --> 00:35:18,914
that he has
a perfectly average product.

502
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,815
He's paying us to be economical
with the truth.

503
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:23,685
So tell him from me
he's gotta go with the talking fish.

504
00:35:25,923 --> 00:35:29,017
By the way,
your daughter is really good at her job.

505
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:33,156
-I know. That's the way she is.
-And she has great hair!

506
00:35:33,564 --> 00:35:35,464
-It's healthy.
-Okay.

507
00:35:44,275 --> 00:35:47,676
I know. Yeah, but you know what?
It was fine.

508
00:35:47,712 --> 00:35:50,840
But it would be really awesome,
I would... No.

509
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:54,280
There was a line. Sorry.

510
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:56,878
My watch is off by an hour.
Should I change it?

511
00:35:57,488 --> 00:36:00,785
You came from New York, so,
yeah, you need to go back an hour.

512
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:02,258
Use Central Time.

513
00:36:04,729 --> 00:36:06,924
You were laughing on the phone.
That was nice to see.

514
00:36:06,964 --> 00:36:08,124
-I was?
-Yeah.

515
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:11,067
-It was just work.
-It was nice.

516
00:36:12,303 --> 00:36:14,771
-Was it the fish?
-The what?

517
00:36:14,805 --> 00:36:18,138
-The fish?
-Yeah, the client went with the fish.

518
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:22,036
They said they should give it a name.
I said we should call it Frank.

519
00:36:22,313 --> 00:36:24,213
-Because of me?
-Of course 'cause of you!

520
00:36:24,248 --> 00:36:26,842
-No, not because of me. Really?
-Yeah. For real.

521
00:36:26,884 --> 00:36:28,909
-Frank the fish?
-Frank the fish.

522
00:36:28,953 --> 00:36:30,443
-No?
-What?

523
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:32,183
-Hi.
-Hey.

524
00:36:32,223 --> 00:36:34,851
Hey, you should be at your desk,
shouldn't you?

525
00:36:34,892 --> 00:36:37,224
Dad, this is Tom,
one of our creative directors.

526
00:36:37,261 --> 00:36:40,753
-Tom, this is my dad, Frank.
-Hi, sir. Nice to meet you.

527
00:36:40,798 --> 00:36:43,665
-Tom.
-So, what are you up to?

528
00:36:44,268 --> 00:36:45,963
I was supposed to be heading
out of town to meet a client,

529
00:36:46,003 --> 00:36:47,436
but the train got delayed.

530
00:36:48,406 --> 00:36:50,670
-Hey, why don't you sit down?
-No, no, no, I'd be interrupting you.

531
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:52,505
-No, it's fine. It's fine.
-Really?

532
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:55,376
-Yeah. Sit down.
-Well, thank you.

533
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,847
So, do you live here
or are you just visiting?

534
00:37:00,651 --> 00:37:03,051
No, no, I'm just staying the one night.

535
00:37:08,426 --> 00:37:10,360
-Here, this is for you.
-What is it?

536
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:12,021
-You'll see.
-Well, tell me.

537
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:15,123
No, you'll see. You'll see.
I didn't wanna send it in the mail.

538
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:17,566
-You'll see.
-Okay.

539
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:18,728
You know what I'm trying to do?

540
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:20,236
I'm trying to get us
all around the same table.

541
00:37:20,271 --> 00:37:23,069
The same table.
Yeah, like we used to at Christmas.

542
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:26,606
Are you happy?

543
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:29,440
-What do you mean?
-Are you happy?

544
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:33,406
Yeah, of course I am. I'm...

545
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:38,112
Good. Good. Good girl.

546
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:41,288
A happy one. First one on my list.

547
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,043
Isn't it terrible about Alice?

548
00:38:05,816 --> 00:38:09,047
-Alice?
-The storm sweeping up the coast.

549
00:38:12,056 --> 00:38:14,923
My name is Alice, so I took an interest.

550
00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:21,228
-It's Greek, I think, Alice.
-Is it Greek?

551
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:24,198
-It means truth.
-Truth.

552
00:38:27,538 --> 00:38:30,029
Yeah, well, I heard about it. I...

553
00:38:31,742 --> 00:38:34,734
I was there a few days ago.
I must have just missed it.

554
00:38:34,779 --> 00:38:38,340
-You're lucky, then.
-Yeah, well, I'm always lucky.

555
00:38:38,382 --> 00:38:40,282
I'm always lucky.

556
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,685
Amy, have you seen David?

557
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:53,754
-No, not yet.
-Why not?

558
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:56,827
Well, I had an appointment
with a guy at the prison,

559
00:38:56,867 --> 00:38:58,334
but he didn't turn up.

560
00:38:58,369 --> 00:39:00,769
And I went to the embassy
and found a lawyer,

561
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:04,036
but he can't meet till the morning.
I've just been running around.

562
00:39:04,442 --> 00:39:06,376
Hopefully tomorrow
I'll start to get somewhere

563
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:08,708
-and we can tell Dad.
-Okay.

564
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,539
Look, I'll call you as soon as
I know what's going on.

565
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:13,550
But, listen, don't worry. Okay?

566
00:39:15,252 --> 00:39:18,221
<i>Oh, sweet morning</i>

567
00:39:18,756 --> 00:39:22,692
<i>Is your head not right</i>

568
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:28,188
<i>Did you heed my warning</i>

569
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:32,836
<i>This is the time of times</i>

570
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:38,165
<i>And your head feels like your body</i>

571
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:43,775
<i>Your mind is close behind</i>

572
00:39:43,814 --> 00:39:48,012
<i>There's a teardrop on your shoulder</i>

573
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:50,145
<i>Says this is the time of times</i>

574
00:39:50,187 --> 00:39:51,984
Could you take a picture of me
in front of this?

575
00:39:52,022 --> 00:39:53,046
Yeah.

576
00:39:58,629 --> 00:40:00,096
And one more just to...

577
00:40:00,598 --> 00:40:02,793
Like... Could you... Yeah.

578
00:40:19,817 --> 00:40:22,411
Okay, everybody,
it's a new day,

579
00:40:22,453 --> 00:40:24,546
an opportunity for all of us
to make amends.

580
00:40:25,122 --> 00:40:26,612
So, why don't we start
at the beginning?

581
00:40:26,657 --> 00:40:29,421
Horns, trumpets,
very percussive in the first section.

582
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:32,452
Strings, more energy in those bows.
Ready?

583
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:46,601
-It's fine. I'll take you right through.
-Thank you.

584
00:40:49,647 --> 00:40:51,171
They're rehearsing right now.

585
00:42:13,764 --> 00:42:17,256
-Hey, Dad, what are you doing here?
-What am I doing?

586
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:18,928
I've come to see you conduct.

587
00:42:18,969 --> 00:42:21,164
-What are you doing?
-I'm rehearsing.

588
00:42:23,007 --> 00:42:26,465
-Aren't you conducting?
-Not today. No. I'm...

589
00:42:27,144 --> 00:42:31,240
-You're playing the drum.
-I am. It's percussion.

590
00:42:33,517 --> 00:42:35,007
It's what I do.

591
00:42:36,253 --> 00:42:41,054
-I thought you were conducting.
-Not today. I'll explain.

592
00:42:41,091 --> 00:42:42,319
I should get back.

593
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,258
You just walked off the stage
and nobody noticed?

594
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:48,422
Come on, stop it.
What are you doing here?

595
00:42:48,465 --> 00:42:50,990
I'm visiting. It's a surprise.

596
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:53,836
I came to spend some time
with my son, the conductor.

597
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:59,239
-That's my cue.
-Well, get back, get back.

598
00:42:59,276 --> 00:43:00,709
Okay.

599
00:43:16,327 --> 00:43:19,694
-That's very good.
-Very good. Yeah.

600
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:22,592
Never hit a drum in my life,
but suddenly I'm very good.

601
00:43:22,633 --> 00:43:25,158
Without training, without skill,

602
00:43:25,202 --> 00:43:27,534
without all the musical talent
that you have.

603
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:29,703
Never said I was conducting, Dad.

604
00:43:30,908 --> 00:43:34,139
Yeah, well, your mother said
you were doing well,

605
00:43:34,178 --> 00:43:37,511
that you were conducting
and composing and doing your music.

606
00:43:37,548 --> 00:43:41,746
I am doing my music. It's percussion.
It suits me just fine.

607
00:43:43,988 --> 00:43:45,615
But the drum?

608
00:43:47,257 --> 00:43:49,384
It's low pressure, and I enjoy it.

609
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:53,752
I get to travel, the money's fine,
I got no ties.

610
00:43:55,432 --> 00:43:59,732
Everybody said that you had a talent,
that you had a future.

611
00:44:01,071 --> 00:44:03,801
People are polite, Dad. You know,
they don't always tell you the truth.

612
00:44:03,841 --> 00:44:06,366
The truth is,
I was never quite good enough.

613
00:44:10,547 --> 00:44:14,381
But all that education,
and now you're disappointed?

614
00:44:15,252 --> 00:44:16,583
I'm not disappointed.

615
00:44:17,121 --> 00:44:19,954
I'm not disappointed,
but you obviously are.

616
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:22,959
No, I'm not disappointed.
It just seems like a waste, that's all.

617
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:25,985
Of what? What's it a waste of?
Of your telephone wire?

618
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:28,863
No, no. It's not that. I didn't say that.

619
00:44:30,134 --> 00:44:33,126
You know, I still compose,
and I conduct in my spare time,

620
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:35,638
but nobody wants to employ me
to do that professionally.

621
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,265
That's just the way it is.

622
00:44:37,307 --> 00:44:40,299
Well, I guess I'm just saying
it's never too late. You could...

623
00:44:40,744 --> 00:44:43,975
You could keep at it
and go back to studying,

624
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:46,448
-and I could help you out.
-It doesn't work like that, Dad.

625
00:44:46,483 --> 00:44:49,816
If it was going to have happened,
it would have happened by now.

626
00:44:50,621 --> 00:44:54,580
Besides, I'm not sure it's what I wanted.
I think maybe I was doing it for you.

627
00:44:55,292 --> 00:44:56,486
I don't believe that.

628
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:59,860
Dad, the point is, this suits me just fine.
This is what I want.

629
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:05,835
Hey. Hey.

630
00:45:07,404 --> 00:45:10,271
Are you managing okay at home?

631
00:45:10,641 --> 00:45:13,906
-Yeah, I'm cooking every day.
-Cooking? Yeah?

632
00:45:14,778 --> 00:45:18,236
-Do you know what you're doing?
-No, I just make it up, but...

633
00:45:19,983 --> 00:45:22,975
Well, I thought we could spend
a couple of days together.

634
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:26,212
I... Dad, I fly to Europe this evening.

635
00:45:26,256 --> 00:45:28,918
It's a big trip.
We gotta pack up this afternoon.

636
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:31,554
I wish I could, honestly, but you know...

637
00:45:31,595 --> 00:45:34,257
I'm sorry, Dad.
That would have been great.

638
00:45:40,204 --> 00:45:41,535
Well...

639
00:45:50,147 --> 00:45:53,446
I went to see David in New York.
Is he still at the same address?

640
00:45:54,184 --> 00:45:56,084
Yeah. I think so.

641
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:59,584
Yeah, I want to check his address
and phone number with you.

642
00:46:00,357 --> 00:46:01,483
Sure.

643
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:05,323
-I need some fresh air.
-All right.

644
00:46:11,368 --> 00:46:14,235
-Robert, come on. Don't smoke.
-What do you mean, don't smoke?

645
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,739
Don't smoke. You know better.
Come on.

646
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:18,139
Don't smoke.

647
00:46:20,144 --> 00:46:23,341
All right, I won't smoke.
Not in front of you.

648
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:27,316
Not if it upsets you,
but you know I do smoke sometimes.

649
00:46:27,351 --> 00:46:28,716
Just so you know.

650
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:31,686
-Anyway, you used to smoke.
-I know I used to smoke.

651
00:46:31,722 --> 00:46:32,882
That's when I didn't know any better.

652
00:46:32,923 --> 00:46:36,086
Now I do.
Your mother made me stop, too.

653
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:41,029
You know, I will, too, but occasionally
I do smoke. When I wanna quit, I'll quit.

654
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:43,664
-Hey, Robert.
-Hey, Dave.

655
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:47,062
Let me get this straight.
You worked in a wire factory

656
00:46:47,104 --> 00:46:48,935
smoking a couple of packs a day,

657
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:53,432
but me being a percussionist
and having an occasional cigarette

658
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:56,446
-isn't good enough for you?
-Come on.

659
00:46:58,749 --> 00:47:00,979
You know, Mom used to say,
"Make your dad proud.

660
00:47:01,018 --> 00:47:03,418
"He works so hard for us."
And I know you're not proud of me.

661
00:47:03,453 --> 00:47:04,477
I know.

662
00:47:04,521 --> 00:47:06,887
-That's not true.
-I can feel it. It's fine.

663
00:47:06,924 --> 00:47:09,586
I'm working hard here.
I'm doing the best I can.

664
00:47:09,626 --> 00:47:12,026
-Have your cigarette.
-What?

665
00:47:12,062 --> 00:47:14,394
Have your cigarette, you need it.

666
00:47:18,702 --> 00:47:20,431
No, you know what? I quit.

667
00:47:23,106 --> 00:47:25,097
-Hi, Robert.
-Hey, I just quit smoking.

668
00:47:25,442 --> 00:47:27,000
-Good job.
-Thanks.

669
00:47:28,078 --> 00:47:29,670
I'm not quitting
because you want me to.

670
00:47:29,713 --> 00:47:32,773
I'm quitting
'cause I know you don't think I can.

671
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:36,482
-Just to make that clear, okay?
-Okay.

672
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:41,055
Anyway, you sounded good
on the drums.

673
00:47:41,558 --> 00:47:43,958
I missed a beat
when I heard you coming in,

674
00:47:43,994 --> 00:47:46,690
bumping your bag.
You kind of threw me off there.

675
00:47:47,898 --> 00:47:51,163
Well, anyway,
what's a missed beat here and there?

676
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:52,896
It's good, sounded very good.

677
00:47:54,438 --> 00:47:57,635
Yeah. Thanks, Dad.

678
00:48:00,611 --> 00:48:04,138
We don't see each other very often.
I wasn't trying to...

679
00:48:04,748 --> 00:48:06,807
I'm sorry, you know. I just...

680
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:09,683
Look, you just gave up smoking.
You're gonna be a little edgy.

681
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,314
Is that...
Is that what it is?

682
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:16,591
-Well, anyway, I'm sorry.
-Yeah, well, I'm sorry, too.

683
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:21,322
Hey, James,
I want to introduce you to my father.

684
00:48:21,365 --> 00:48:23,230
-Of course.
-This is James Green,

685
00:48:23,267 --> 00:48:24,859
-famous conductor.
-Hi, James.

686
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:26,961
This is Frank, my dad.
Very famous dad.

687
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:30,504
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice meeting you.

688
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:31,734
-Good luck with everything.
-Thanks.

689
00:48:31,775 --> 00:48:33,037
He's busy.

690
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,048
You got a girlfriend
you wanna tell me about?

691
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:44,285
-There was someone up until recently.
-But not anymore?

692
00:48:45,122 --> 00:48:49,752
You know, she wanted to settle down.
She started talking about babies.

693
00:48:50,694 --> 00:48:53,060
It's difficult with the traveling,
you know?

694
00:48:54,898 --> 00:48:56,798
There's some girls in the orchestra.

695
00:48:57,234 --> 00:49:00,362
-I noticed.
-Yeah? You noticed?

696
00:49:00,737 --> 00:49:03,729
-I got my eye on a couple of them.
-Couple, yeah?

697
00:49:05,475 --> 00:49:08,842
Well, you look...
You look after yourself, Robert.

698
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:13,075
I'm getting the whole family together.
Amy's gonna call you.

699
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:16,711
But if not, if she forgets, you call her
and you stay in touch with each other.

700
00:49:16,753 --> 00:49:18,152
I will. I will.

701
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:21,958
-And you're happy?
-Happy, yeah.

702
00:49:21,992 --> 00:49:25,223
I get paid to bang a big loud drum
all day. Of course I'm happy.

703
00:49:28,699 --> 00:49:30,166
Okay, I'm...

704
00:49:35,339 --> 00:49:38,172
Hey, I'm sorry that we couldn't spend
more time together.

705
00:49:50,053 --> 00:49:52,613
<i>Maybe I'm wrong</i>

706
00:49:55,692 --> 00:49:59,253
<i>Amputate sympathy</i>

707
00:50:01,398 --> 00:50:04,959
<i>Strength of my tongue</i>

708
00:50:06,937 --> 00:50:10,930
<i>It's taken that liberty</i>

709
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:14,109
I don't know. He's...

710
00:50:14,144 --> 00:50:16,044
I'm watching him right now.
He's buying his ticket.

711
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:18,172
He arrives in Vegas at 10:00
tomorrow morning, okay?

712
00:50:18,215 --> 00:50:19,978
<i>Okay. I'll be there.</i>

713
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:21,848
No, no, no.
He doesn't want you to meet him.

714
00:50:21,885 --> 00:50:24,115
-He wants it to be a surprise, okay?
-Of course I'm gonna meet him.

715
00:50:24,154 --> 00:50:27,123
-If I want to meet him, I'll meet him.
-Rosie, he doesn't...

716
00:50:27,491 --> 00:50:30,722
Okay. But, you know,
he's not gonna like it.

717
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:33,595
How are you? Are you okay?

718
00:50:35,265 --> 00:50:37,563
Yeah, I am, I guess...

719
00:50:37,601 --> 00:50:40,297
You know, I wanted to spend some time
with him.

720
00:50:40,337 --> 00:50:44,398
I'm free tonight and tomorrow,
but I just can't. I can't do it. I can't do it.

721
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:48,371
-I don't know what to say to him.
-I know. God, I know.

722
00:50:49,179 --> 00:50:51,079
-Rosie.
-What?

723
00:50:51,114 --> 00:50:54,777
-He's asking about David.
-Okay, I won't say anything.

724
00:50:54,818 --> 00:50:56,979
No, I mean, there's nothing to say.
What are we gonna say?

725
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:58,078
We don't know anything.

726
00:50:58,455 --> 00:51:01,754
<i>Play devil's advocate</i>

727
00:51:03,427 --> 00:51:06,863
<i>Never I fear</i>

728
00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:14,036
<i>Pay for it afterwards</i>

729
00:51:17,474 --> 00:51:19,999
<i>How do I feel?</i>

730
00:51:23,113 --> 00:51:27,106
<i>A glorified refugee</i>

731
00:51:28,685 --> 00:51:33,645
<i>Nobody ever says goodbye</i>

732
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:42,257
<i>But I don't mind</i>

733
00:51:43,366 --> 00:51:46,096
<i>Just come home</i>

734
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,535
Where you heading?

735
00:51:52,008 --> 00:51:54,306
-Where you heading?
-Las Vegas.

736
00:51:54,478 --> 00:51:58,312
Not from here you ain't, not tonight.
Let me see your ticket.

737
00:52:03,353 --> 00:52:06,220
-What time you got?
-10:55.

738
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:08,788
The ticket office said that there was
a bus going to Las Vegas,

739
00:52:08,825 --> 00:52:10,486
Bay 3, at 11:00.

740
00:52:10,527 --> 00:52:11,755
Well, now, all we know for sure

741
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:14,263
is that your watch ain't being
completely honest with you.

742
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:16,959
There was a bus at 11:00,
but now it's nearly 12:00.

743
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,900
-12:00?
-Where you just come from?

744
00:52:18,935 --> 00:52:21,460
New York, Chicago, Denver.

745
00:52:22,105 --> 00:52:24,835
Seems like you put your watch
back one too many times, my friend.

746
00:52:24,875 --> 00:52:29,073
There ain't no way you gonna catch
a bus that left here an hour ago.

747
00:52:29,179 --> 00:52:31,204
-There's no other bus?
-There's no other bus.

748
00:52:31,248 --> 00:52:33,079
Not this time of night.

749
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:36,378
There's a truck stop
100 yards up the road.

750
00:52:36,586 --> 00:52:40,682
If you're lucky, you might pick up a lift
and catch the night train.

751
00:52:40,724 --> 00:52:42,351
Okay. Thank you.

752
00:52:48,031 --> 00:52:51,432
I'm wondering, "Why is this guy
trying to see his whole family,

753
00:52:51,468 --> 00:52:53,595
"all over the country,
all in the same trip?"

754
00:52:53,637 --> 00:52:56,037
Well, I'm not dying,
if that's what you're thinking.

755
00:52:56,072 --> 00:52:58,233
Hey, I'm not thinking anything.

756
00:52:58,275 --> 00:53:01,073
I'm just trying to visit the kids
and surprise them.

757
00:53:01,111 --> 00:53:06,208
Their mother's always kept an eye
on them, and now it's up to me, so...

758
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:09,644
-You lost your wife?
-About 8 months ago.

759
00:53:09,753 --> 00:53:13,883
I lost my husband.
Just over a year now.

760
00:53:14,958 --> 00:53:18,450
I lost him to drink, but it was my fault.
I was stupid.

761
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:21,630
Ignored all the signs,
you know how you do?

762
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:25,661
I listen to that radio all day in this cab.

763
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:28,967
We got ourselves an epidemic
going on out there.

764
00:53:29,472 --> 00:53:31,736
You know, people eating too much,
drinking too much,

765
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:34,073
killing themselves, basically.

766
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:36,670
Making up excuses all along the way.

767
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:40,313
Because facing up to the truth
ain't always easy.

768
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:42,477
-No.
-Man, people like things easy.

769
00:53:42,519 --> 00:53:45,079
-That's what they're used to.
-Yeah.

770
00:53:45,322 --> 00:53:46,954
No one likes to get hurt.

771
00:53:51,528 --> 00:53:55,020
No. Nobody likes to get hurt.

772
00:53:55,932 --> 00:53:58,526
I stop off in Reno.
There's a night train from there,

773
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:00,433
gets you into Vegas in the morning.

774
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:02,938
Otherwise, there's a cheap little motel
where I shut down,

775
00:54:02,973 --> 00:54:05,999
if you don't wanna travel
through the night.

776
00:54:12,782 --> 00:54:15,410
Don't get all shy on me.
That wasn't a proposition.

777
00:54:15,452 --> 00:54:18,717
-No, I...
-Yeah, I sleep in the truck, all right?

778
00:54:25,895 --> 00:54:29,058
-Take care, Frank.
-I appreciate it. Thank you.

779
00:54:58,128 --> 00:55:00,596
-Are you all right?
-Don't touch me.

780
00:55:00,997 --> 00:55:04,489
-I'm not touching anybody. I'm just...
-Don't touch me.

781
00:55:05,835 --> 00:55:09,703
You okay?
Do your parents know where you are?

782
00:55:10,774 --> 00:55:13,971
If I give you some money,
will you eat something?

783
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:15,204
Yeah, I'm clean, man.

784
00:55:15,245 --> 00:55:18,442
-Do you need some money?
-I could use some money.

785
00:55:18,682 --> 00:55:20,980
I mean,
everyone can use some money, right?

786
00:55:21,017 --> 00:55:25,954
Okay. Here you go. Here.

787
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:31,350
You're okay?

788
00:55:31,394 --> 00:55:35,023
-Yeah. What's with the questions?
-Well, you could say thank you.

789
00:55:35,065 --> 00:55:37,295
-Could what?
-You could say thank you.

790
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:40,326
I gave you some money.
You could say thank you.

791
00:55:40,370 --> 00:55:42,065
Hey, you're right.

792
00:55:42,605 --> 00:55:45,233
I'm sorry, man, you're right.
Yeah. I forgot my manners.

793
00:55:45,275 --> 00:55:48,836
You got a couple of hundred dollars
in there and this is my thanks.

794
00:56:04,894 --> 00:56:06,418
Need that?

795
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:13,969
Please don't do anything. Just...
I need... That's my medication. No. No.

796
00:56:26,949 --> 00:56:28,474
God, no.

797
00:57:08,725 --> 00:57:11,023
<i>I'm not here at the moment,</i>

798
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:13,187
<i>and Frank is probably in the garden.</i>

799
00:57:13,229 --> 00:57:15,288
<i>Leave a message,
and I'll call you back.</i>

800
00:58:06,416 --> 00:58:07,610
David?

801
00:58:10,553 --> 00:58:11,713
David?

802
00:58:12,589 --> 00:58:15,956
Of all my children, you're the one
that I worry about the most.

803
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:17,653
I'm trying, Dad.

804
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:22,497
-Dad!
-David!

805
00:58:24,434 --> 00:58:26,595
Tell me when I can see you.

806
00:58:31,808 --> 00:58:33,036
Dad?

807
00:58:43,319 --> 00:58:45,947
-Robert, Dad wasn't on the bus.
-What?

808
00:58:45,989 --> 00:58:47,650
I met the 10:00 bus like you said,

809
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:51,126
and everyone else got off,
but he's not on it.

810
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:54,755
Well... Well, did you look
in the station? I mean...

811
00:58:54,797 --> 00:58:57,095
Yeah, of course,
I looked everywhere.

812
00:58:57,133 --> 00:59:00,261
I don't know what to tell you.
He was doing the 10:00.

813
00:59:00,303 --> 00:59:02,430
So how can he not be on it?

814
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:04,931
Are you all right, Frank?

815
00:59:04,974 --> 00:59:06,771
Listen, the damnedest thing happened.

816
00:59:06,809 --> 00:59:08,936
I was brushing my teeth this morning,

817
00:59:08,978 --> 00:59:12,414
and I left my bottle of pills
right on the edge of the sink.

818
00:59:12,448 --> 00:59:15,110
Well, I knocked the whole thing
right into the sink, and it got all wet.

819
00:59:15,151 --> 00:59:17,346
- There's nothing left. In the sink.
-In the sink. Gee, God damn it,

820
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:19,480
-you're as bad as me, you know that.
-The damnedest thing.

821
00:59:19,522 --> 00:59:21,183
Listen, I'll write a new prescription,
all right?

822
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:23,385
Just pop in. I'll leave it in the reception.

823
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:26,957
Is that the only way to get them?
Go to reception?

824
00:59:27,363 --> 00:59:28,660
I have to come in?

825
00:59:28,698 --> 00:59:33,897
The garden is doing... Is great... I'm...
It's doing... I'm looking right at it.

826
00:59:33,937 --> 00:59:35,564
Looking really good, really good.

827
00:59:39,642 --> 00:59:43,043
-Hello?
-Hey, it's me. Are you home?

828
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:45,377
No. I'm waiting for you.
Where are you?

829
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:46,746
He told you I was coming,
didn't he?

830
00:59:46,783 --> 00:59:47,841
No.

831
00:59:47,884 --> 00:59:51,513
I told him not to tell you
I was coming, and he told you.

832
01:00:05,802 --> 01:00:08,236
-Hi, Dad.
-Hi, glamour girl.

833
01:00:12,208 --> 01:00:14,301
-Welcome to Vegas, Dad.
-Yeah. Thanks.

834
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:23,009
I didn't order a stretch.
I just wanted something comfortable.

835
01:00:23,052 --> 01:00:25,384
It's good. No, it's got plenty of leg room,
that's for sure.

836
01:00:25,989 --> 01:00:28,480
That's why they call it a stretch.

837
01:00:28,558 --> 01:00:30,719
-I missed you.
-I miss you.

838
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:34,423
-I've been worried about you.
-Tell me about your show.

839
01:00:35,064 --> 01:00:39,865
Okay, we were at the Bellagio,
and it was a big production.

840
01:00:40,737 --> 01:00:44,696
Lots of underwater dance scenes,
and I was the mermaid,

841
01:00:44,741 --> 01:00:46,333
-the lead.
-Of course.

842
01:00:46,376 --> 01:00:49,777
-And you would have loved it.
-Well, when can I go?

843
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:52,440
-It finished last week.
-It finished?

844
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:56,475
Yeah. Next time you have to fly out
and come see me. I just...

845
01:00:56,919 --> 01:00:58,978
I didn't wanna bother you this time

846
01:00:59,022 --> 01:01:00,649
because I knew that
you weren't feeling well,

847
01:01:00,690 --> 01:01:03,022
-but look at you.
-Well, look at you.

848
01:01:03,059 --> 01:01:05,493
A dancer in a Las Vegas show
on the big stage,

849
01:01:05,528 --> 01:01:08,325
just what you always wanted.
Are you happy?

850
01:01:09,032 --> 01:01:10,795
-Very happy.
-Yeah?

851
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:14,166
So, the only thing missing now is...
Anything?

852
01:01:14,937 --> 01:01:16,802
-A man. I know.
-Well...

853
01:01:17,073 --> 01:01:20,304
<i>Papa loves mambo</i>

854
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:23,335
<i>Mama loves mambo</i>

855
01:01:23,379 --> 01:01:26,280
<i>Havin' their fling again
Younger than spring again</i>

856
01:01:26,315 --> 01:01:28,510
<i>Feelin' that zing again, wow</i>

857
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:32,280
-This is where you live?
-No, this is an elevator.

858
01:01:32,321 --> 01:01:33,686
Very good.

859
01:01:34,624 --> 01:01:38,060
I think you'll like the apartment.
It's very spacious.

860
01:01:38,094 --> 01:01:40,790
-Well, I'm happy sleeping on a couch.
-Really?

861
01:01:40,830 --> 01:01:42,695
-Really.
-Okay.

862
01:01:47,503 --> 01:01:48,971
You like it?

863
01:01:49,038 --> 01:01:51,006
-It's...
-Very me?

864
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:53,031
Very you. Very impressive.

865
01:01:57,847 --> 01:02:00,577
-Well, do you wanna see your room?
-Sure.

866
01:02:00,817 --> 01:02:02,478
Okay. Come on.

867
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:08,521
So, bed or sofa? Sofa or bed?

868
01:02:08,925 --> 01:02:10,256
This is my room?

869
01:02:11,027 --> 01:02:14,963
-It's huge. Look at that television.
-I know.

870
01:02:16,165 --> 01:02:18,700
I've booked us dinner at
a place called the Stratosphere.

871
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:20,396
-Do you know what that is?
-No.

872
01:02:20,436 --> 01:02:24,304
It's a revolving restaurant
800 feet above the ground.

873
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:26,604
-Stay just like that.
-Okay.

874
01:02:27,276 --> 01:02:28,300
Okay, one more time.

875
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:31,505
I'll just get that.
Stay there, I'll be right back.

876
01:02:31,547 --> 01:02:33,913
I'm gonna take another picture.

877
01:02:35,685 --> 01:02:37,949
-Jilly, hi.
-Hi. How are you?

878
01:02:37,987 --> 01:02:39,352
Good. Come on in. I want you to meet...

879
01:02:39,388 --> 01:02:41,583
I need a favor. I have to go
pick up Paul from the airport,

880
01:02:41,624 --> 01:02:44,058
-and I haven't got the car seat.
-Okay. I want you to meet my dad.

881
01:02:44,093 --> 01:02:45,754
-Great. Hi.
-Hi.

882
01:02:45,795 --> 01:02:49,060
-Dad, this is my friend, Jilly.
-How you doing?

883
01:02:49,332 --> 01:02:51,732
-Hi. I'm Jilly.
-What was it?

884
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:52,962
-Hi, Jilly.
-It's a pleasure to meet you.

885
01:02:53,002 --> 01:02:55,971
-How are you doing?
-How are you doing? Who's this guy?

886
01:02:56,005 --> 01:02:59,202
This is Max,
and we could really use a favor.

887
01:02:59,242 --> 01:03:01,676
Could you watch him for a few hours?

888
01:03:01,711 --> 01:03:05,169
Yeah. Well, the only thing is, is that we
were gonna head out later for dinner.

889
01:03:05,214 --> 01:03:06,943
You know, it's fine.
You know, I'm gonna pop downstairs.

890
01:03:06,983 --> 01:03:09,816
-I can just see if Helen's around.
-We could stay in if you want.

891
01:03:09,852 --> 01:03:11,342
No. I think you guys should go out.

892
01:03:11,387 --> 01:03:13,378
No, you're tired. It's fine.

893
01:03:13,422 --> 01:03:15,413
-I'm easy, whatever it is.
-We'll take him.

894
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:17,016
-You sure? You sure?
-Here, give him to me.

895
01:03:17,059 --> 01:03:19,254
Thank you so much.
Well, listen, I should be back in time

896
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:21,820
for you guys to go out anyway.
It'll just be a couple of hours.

897
01:03:21,864 --> 01:03:22,956
But thank you again.

898
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:29,969
Okay, yeah, it's fine.
Well, I can bathe him.

899
01:03:30,773 --> 01:03:33,742
Okay, I'll call if I need anything.
Honestly.

900
01:03:33,876 --> 01:03:37,710
I'll be all right. Okay. Bye.

901
01:03:40,449 --> 01:03:41,974
Slight problem.

902
01:03:42,018 --> 01:03:44,578
-Jilly?
-Yeah.

903
01:03:45,721 --> 01:03:48,246
Paul's flight was cancelled,
so he's stuck in LA

904
01:03:48,291 --> 01:03:50,054
and she's going to pick him up.

905
01:03:50,092 --> 01:03:52,856
So, that means
we have Max for the night.

906
01:03:53,563 --> 01:03:55,622
-Okay.
-Is that okay?

907
01:03:56,966 --> 01:03:58,490
It's okay.

908
01:03:58,668 --> 01:04:01,364
What's the matter?
What's the matter?

909
01:04:38,341 --> 01:04:41,333
Okay, just stay up.
Give me your arm.

910
01:04:41,377 --> 01:04:45,370
-Do you want me to get that?
-No, Dad, just leave it. It's fine.

911
01:04:45,548 --> 01:04:47,038
-Okay.
-Thanks.

912
01:04:47,083 --> 01:04:49,677
Keep your eyes closed.
Keep your eyes closed.

913
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:51,482
<i>Hi. I'm not here right now,</i>

914
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:53,283
<i>so please leave me a message.</i>

915
01:04:55,825 --> 01:04:57,315
It's me.

916
01:04:57,360 --> 01:05:01,729
Look, I need the apartment back
sooner than I thought. So call me.

917
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,558
Stop splashing!

918
01:05:23,986 --> 01:05:25,681
A nice apartment.

919
01:05:26,122 --> 01:05:28,488
Yeah, it's a little big, though.

920
01:05:29,659 --> 01:05:33,390
-You bought it?
-No, I'm renting it, but I got a good deal.

921
01:05:40,303 --> 01:05:44,034
Listen, I'm gonna leave tomorrow.
I'm gonna go back home.

922
01:05:44,073 --> 01:05:47,736
-But you just got here.
-I know, but it's been a long trip.

923
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:50,905
I'm running low on my medication.
I just thought I'd...

924
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:53,313
Well, can't we get you a refill?

925
01:05:55,217 --> 01:05:57,447
It's been a long trip, honey.

926
01:06:01,457 --> 01:06:03,857
Yeah. You look tired.

927
01:06:04,327 --> 01:06:07,262
I'm okay. I should get home.

928
01:06:07,763 --> 01:06:09,924
Would you be okay with that?

929
01:06:10,533 --> 01:06:12,831
Yeah. Course.

930
01:06:13,536 --> 01:06:16,972
You should do what you want.
Here, take that.

931
01:06:21,610 --> 01:06:23,703
I was thinking of flying.

932
01:06:23,746 --> 01:06:25,941
-You never fly.
-I know.

933
01:06:33,756 --> 01:06:35,121
Thank you.

934
01:06:36,959 --> 01:06:38,790
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

935
01:06:43,065 --> 01:06:45,829
You didn't really wanna eat out,
did you?

936
01:06:47,069 --> 01:06:51,472
No. I didn't. Not 800 feet above
the ground in a revolving restaurant.

937
01:07:00,282 --> 01:07:03,945
Remember when your mother
taught you how to eat spaghetti?

938
01:07:04,587 --> 01:07:05,713
Yep.

939
01:07:11,193 --> 01:07:14,526
Sometimes I pick up the phone
to dial her number,

940
01:07:15,031 --> 01:07:16,828
and then I remember.

941
01:07:19,435 --> 01:07:21,369
Keep calling next time.

942
01:07:21,437 --> 01:07:25,168
The number's still the same,
and I'm still on the other end.

943
01:07:26,175 --> 01:07:27,369
-Okay.
-Yeah?

944
01:07:27,410 --> 01:07:29,503
-Yes.
-I don't know what it is with you kids.

945
01:07:29,545 --> 01:07:30,876
You always told
your mother everything.

946
01:07:30,913 --> 01:07:35,043
You never told me anything. You were
always on the phone with her.

947
01:07:35,084 --> 01:07:38,747
I'd pick up the phone, I'd say, "Hello,"
you'd say "Hi, Dad. Mom there?"

948
01:07:38,788 --> 01:07:41,348
It wasn't that bad. It was just that

949
01:07:42,158 --> 01:07:44,786
Mom was easier to talk to
and you always worried so much

950
01:07:44,827 --> 01:07:48,194
-if everything wasn't perfect.
-No, that's not true.

951
01:07:50,199 --> 01:07:53,896
-We could just talk to Mom.
-But you couldn't talk to me?

952
01:07:53,936 --> 01:07:57,394
Well, she was a good listener.
You were a good talker.

953
01:07:57,773 --> 01:08:00,606
Well, so that's good.
We made a good team.

954
01:08:01,143 --> 01:08:02,269
Yeah.

955
01:08:04,213 --> 01:08:06,977
You wouldn't change anything,
would you?

956
01:08:08,818 --> 01:08:10,877
You pushed us pretty hard.

957
01:08:11,253 --> 01:08:14,154
No. That's not true. I...

958
01:08:16,592 --> 01:08:19,254
You didn't all feel that way, did you?

959
01:08:19,395 --> 01:08:22,228
I think David felt it the most.

960
01:08:23,599 --> 01:08:25,089
Yeah, well...

961
01:08:29,538 --> 01:08:31,301
I can see that.

962
01:08:31,974 --> 01:08:34,499
He so never wanted to let you down.

963
01:08:36,145 --> 01:08:37,373
I know.

964
01:08:37,913 --> 01:08:40,313
I was never any harder on him,
as far as I could see.

965
01:08:40,349 --> 01:08:43,375
You were all different,
and look at him today.

966
01:08:45,421 --> 01:08:47,651
Did I tell you
I went to see him in New York?

967
01:08:47,690 --> 01:08:49,055
-No.
-Yeah, he wasn't there,

968
01:08:49,091 --> 01:08:51,457
but I saw some of his artwork
downstairs in a gallery

969
01:08:51,494 --> 01:08:56,056
below his apartment. It was right there
on display. It was just beautiful.

970
01:08:56,432 --> 01:08:58,525
So look what happened to him.

971
01:08:58,567 --> 01:09:01,331
He turned out okay.
You turned out okay.

972
01:09:02,972 --> 01:09:04,769
I don't know, Dad.

973
01:09:05,174 --> 01:09:07,608
How can you say that? Look at you.

974
01:09:07,643 --> 01:09:11,170
You've wanted to be a dancer
ever since you were a little girl.

975
01:09:11,213 --> 01:09:13,738
You were gifted,
and nobody pushed you.

976
01:09:13,782 --> 01:09:16,046
-What about your plans?
-It all worked out.

977
01:09:16,085 --> 01:09:19,020
What did you wanna be
when you were my age?

978
01:09:19,488 --> 01:09:21,479
I didn't have any plans.

979
01:09:21,857 --> 01:09:23,381
I just wanted to hold down a job

980
01:09:23,425 --> 01:09:27,020
and find somebody crazy enough
to marry me, like your mother.

981
01:09:28,430 --> 01:09:31,228
But when you guys came along,
things were different.

982
01:09:31,267 --> 01:09:32,427
There were opportunities.

983
01:09:32,468 --> 01:09:34,864
What kind of father would I have been
if I hadn't pushed you?

984
01:09:35,204 --> 01:09:37,729
So there wasn't anything you wanted
to achieve?

985
01:09:37,773 --> 01:09:42,369
No, I didn't really think much about it.
Never really gave it much thought.

986
01:09:42,845 --> 01:09:46,440
All I wanted to do
was just be a good father, that's all.

987
01:09:58,093 --> 01:10:00,323
So you've got your boarding pass,

988
01:10:00,362 --> 01:10:04,423
and you're all checked in,
and we know your gate.

989
01:10:05,034 --> 01:10:06,262
So?

990
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:09,436
I'll come visit you as soon as I can,
I promise.

991
01:10:09,471 --> 01:10:13,498
I'd like that. I wanna get us
all around the same table together.

992
01:10:13,709 --> 01:10:16,542
-At Christmas?
-Or before, it's up to you.

993
01:10:16,579 --> 01:10:18,444
Great. Count me in.

994
01:10:21,116 --> 01:10:22,242
Here.

995
01:10:23,385 --> 01:10:24,818
What's this?

996
01:10:24,987 --> 01:10:27,353
I had to give it to each of you.

997
01:10:27,489 --> 01:10:30,117
-Well, shall I open it?
-No, open it later.

998
01:10:30,159 --> 01:10:32,320
-Are you sure?
-Sure I'm sure.

999
01:10:33,495 --> 01:10:34,621
Okay.

1000
01:10:36,332 --> 01:10:37,629
Okay.

1001
01:10:41,804 --> 01:10:44,295
-Be good.
-Just for you.

1002
01:10:48,677 --> 01:10:50,838
-Be good.
-I will.

1003
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:06,593
Bye, Dad.

1004
01:11:16,005 --> 01:11:17,768
Have a good flight.

1005
01:11:43,365 --> 01:11:44,889
<i>Rosie, where's Dad?</i>

1006
01:11:44,933 --> 01:11:47,265
He's on his way home.
I just left him.

1007
01:11:47,836 --> 01:11:49,736
What did you find out?

1008
01:11:50,139 --> 01:11:52,630
David was caught buying
some drugs in a bar.

1009
01:11:52,841 --> 01:11:53,899
No.

1010
01:11:53,942 --> 01:11:55,807
He got sick so quickly
that they now think

1011
01:11:55,844 --> 01:11:57,607
he may have panicked
and swallowed some of the drugs

1012
01:11:57,646 --> 01:11:58,772
when he was arrested.

1013
01:11:58,814 --> 01:12:01,044
Is he okay?
Have you seen him?

1014
01:12:01,083 --> 01:12:03,108
Not yet.
He was taken to a hospital.

1015
01:12:03,152 --> 01:12:05,416
I'm there now,
but they're not being very helpful.

1016
01:12:05,454 --> 01:12:06,853
What do you mean?

1017
01:12:06,889 --> 01:12:09,824
I keep asking if he's here,
but I can't get a straight answer.

1018
01:12:09,858 --> 01:12:13,123
Listen, the lawyer's with me
and the guy from the embassy's here.

1019
01:12:13,162 --> 01:12:14,789
I need you to call Robert.

1020
01:12:14,830 --> 01:12:16,559
I promised I'd call him
before his concert,

1021
01:12:16,598 --> 01:12:19,726
tell him what's going on.
Can you do that for me?

1022
01:12:19,768 --> 01:12:20,894
Yeah.

1023
01:12:35,751 --> 01:12:38,845
Excuse me?
How much longer before we land?

1024
01:12:39,421 --> 01:12:42,254
40 minutes, but there's a storm
so it might take a little longer.

1025
01:12:42,291 --> 01:12:43,758
-A storm?
-It's okay.

1026
01:12:43,792 --> 01:12:46,192
We go around it, not through it.

1027
01:12:46,328 --> 01:12:49,388
-Can I have some more water, please?
-Sure.

1028
01:12:55,304 --> 01:12:56,771
Excuse me.

1029
01:13:08,384 --> 01:13:09,749
Ladies and gentlemen,
the captain

1030
01:13:09,785 --> 01:13:11,685
has turned on the seatbelt sign,

1031
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:14,848
so we ask you to please return
to your seats as soon as possible.

1032
01:13:19,928 --> 01:13:23,022
Sir, you need to push your table up.
Thank you.

1033
01:13:30,906 --> 01:13:33,466
Sir, is everything all right?

1034
01:13:42,351 --> 01:13:47,015
Okay, sir. You're gonna be fine.
You're gonna be fine.

1035
01:13:47,055 --> 01:13:49,182
Just breathe for me.
You're gonna be fine.

1036
01:13:51,894 --> 01:13:54,761
Come on, it's ready.
Everybody sit down.

1037
01:13:55,130 --> 01:13:56,927
Hey, David. Come on!

1038
01:13:58,300 --> 01:14:02,464
-Thank you.
-How come you're home, Dad?

1039
01:14:03,172 --> 01:14:06,005
-I took the day off work.
-But you'd never do that.

1040
01:14:06,041 --> 01:14:08,908
I know, but I wanted to spend
some time with you guys.

1041
01:14:08,944 --> 01:14:11,879
-Is anything wrong?
-No, nothing is wrong.

1042
01:14:12,114 --> 01:14:15,083
Well, you know,
actually there is something.

1043
01:14:17,386 --> 01:14:19,650
You know,
I've been asking myself a question

1044
01:14:19,688 --> 01:14:22,953
that's been like a puzzle,
and I can't figure it out.

1045
01:14:23,025 --> 01:14:25,357
Let's stop eating for a minute.

1046
01:14:28,597 --> 01:14:31,589
I keep asking myself
why you all lied to me,

1047
01:14:33,235 --> 01:14:34,634
all of you.

1048
01:14:34,703 --> 01:14:38,639
Amy, Jeff wore the same shirt to work
the morning after I stayed.

1049
01:14:38,674 --> 01:14:41,609
He doesn't live with you anymore,
does he?

1050
01:14:42,044 --> 01:14:44,376
He left home about 3 months ago.

1051
01:14:44,413 --> 01:14:47,211
There's another woman.
That's why Jack hates him.

1052
01:14:47,549 --> 01:14:50,143
When that man Tom came over to me
at the station and shook my hand,

1053
01:14:50,185 --> 01:14:52,517
he wanted to make an impression,
didn't he?

1054
01:14:52,554 --> 01:14:55,853
You pulled a chair up before he came
over 'cause you were expecting him.

1055
01:14:55,891 --> 01:14:57,950
Tom was waiting at the station.

1056
01:14:57,993 --> 01:15:01,861
I wanted to know that you'd met him.
I didn't want to miss the opportunity.

1057
01:15:01,897 --> 01:15:05,389
In case I get sick
and we never get the chance to meet?

1058
01:15:15,477 --> 01:15:16,774
Robert.

1059
01:15:16,812 --> 01:15:18,939
I think we should go in.
I think I felt some rain.

1060
01:15:18,981 --> 01:15:21,347
There were posters all over the city.
You weren't going to Europe.

1061
01:15:21,383 --> 01:15:24,682
You weren't even performing that night.
We could have spent time together.

1062
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:26,278
But you lied to me.
You didn't wanna be with me.

1063
01:15:26,321 --> 01:15:30,655
No, the truth is, Dad, there are
lots of things that we don't tell you,

1064
01:15:30,692 --> 01:15:33,252
but that doesn't mean
that we want to hurt you.

1065
01:15:33,295 --> 01:15:34,990
Mom didn't always tell you everything
and you know that.

1066
01:15:35,030 --> 01:15:38,397
Don't blame your mother for this,
and wipe your mouth.

1067
01:15:39,868 --> 01:15:42,393
Rosie, the baby is yours, isn't it?

1068
01:15:45,574 --> 01:15:47,565
I was going to tell you.

1069
01:15:48,777 --> 01:15:52,543
-Go on. Tell him the rest.
-Robert, shut up.

1070
01:15:52,581 --> 01:15:55,049
-Go on. I'll tell him.
-Shut up.

1071
01:15:55,183 --> 01:15:57,151
She doesn't know
if she likes boys or girls.

1072
01:15:57,185 --> 01:15:58,914
Robert, stop it.

1073
01:16:00,255 --> 01:16:02,917
Did your mother know
you were pregnant?

1074
01:16:04,660 --> 01:16:07,322
And she kept it from me.
Why would she do that?

1075
01:16:07,362 --> 01:16:11,389
We were going to tell you,
but then Mom got sick.

1076
01:16:12,134 --> 01:16:14,398
I didn't wanna disappoint you.

1077
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:22,643
David, do you still live in New York
at that apartment?

1078
01:16:23,445 --> 01:16:24,571
No.

1079
01:16:24,613 --> 01:16:27,013
-Then where can I find you?
-I can't tell you.

1080
01:16:27,049 --> 01:16:29,279
Tell me where I can find you
and when I can see you.

1081
01:16:29,318 --> 01:16:31,218
I don't wanna see you, Dad.

1082
01:16:31,253 --> 01:16:33,187
No, stop... Do not laugh at me.

1083
01:16:34,222 --> 01:16:35,917
Tell me the truth.

1084
01:16:36,992 --> 01:16:40,689
Wipe that smirk off your face.
Wipe the smirk off your face!

1085
01:16:40,729 --> 01:16:43,892
I have your skateboard right in the shed
over there. I know exactly where it is.

1086
01:16:43,932 --> 01:16:45,331
I'll burn the damn thing! You hear me?

1087
01:16:46,435 --> 01:16:48,995
-Don't laugh. Don't laugh. Quiet!
-A 2-by-4 with wheels!

1088
01:16:49,605 --> 01:16:53,234
After everything I've done for you,
this is all you can do is laugh?

1089
01:16:53,275 --> 01:16:56,073
When I'm asking you about something
that's worrying me?

1090
01:16:56,111 --> 01:16:58,375
Jesus! David!

1091
01:16:58,647 --> 01:17:00,512
Your mother always asked me
why I was so hard on you.

1092
01:17:00,549 --> 01:17:04,349
This is why. This is exactly why!
Have some respect!

1093
01:17:17,532 --> 01:17:21,525
-So what am I supposed to do?
-Act as though nothing's wrong.

1094
01:17:21,570 --> 01:17:23,970
That's what Mom did.
It's best for all of us.

1095
01:17:24,006 --> 01:17:26,201
I can't do that.
I can't act as if nothing happened.

1096
01:17:26,241 --> 01:17:28,641
What do I tell your mother?
What do I say?

1097
01:17:28,677 --> 01:17:31,202
Anyway, she won't ask or anything
'cause she's dead.

1098
01:17:31,279 --> 01:17:32,576
David!

1099
01:17:41,723 --> 01:17:43,020
That's it. I've had enough!

1100
01:17:43,058 --> 01:17:45,356
-I'm out of here.
-Me, too! I'm out of here!

1101
01:17:45,394 --> 01:17:46,656
Come on!

1102
01:17:48,697 --> 01:17:50,358
Tell her nothing.

1103
01:17:50,532 --> 01:17:54,161
-How can I do that?
-If you love her as she loves you,

1104
01:17:54,703 --> 01:17:57,638
then you'll tell her
what she wants to hear.

1105
01:17:57,706 --> 01:17:59,970
Tell her that we are all fine.

1106
01:19:03,338 --> 01:19:04,430
Dad?

1107
01:19:27,729 --> 01:19:31,927
At last. I finally have my family
in the same room.

1108
01:19:34,870 --> 01:19:36,394
Is David here?

1109
01:19:36,438 --> 01:19:38,463
Rosie's here, and Robert.

1110
01:19:38,607 --> 01:19:40,404
How are you feeling?

1111
01:19:40,842 --> 01:19:43,675
-Was it a heart attack?
-They're not sure.

1112
01:19:45,514 --> 01:19:47,505
Amy, is he telling the truth?

1113
01:19:47,549 --> 01:19:50,450
The doctors are waiting
for some test results.

1114
01:19:50,485 --> 01:19:53,249
Come on. You don't have to lie to me.

1115
01:19:54,356 --> 01:19:58,019
I always find it so hard
to believe all of you now.

1116
01:19:58,693 --> 01:19:59,955
Come on.

1117
01:20:01,897 --> 01:20:04,229
They suspected a heart attack.

1118
01:20:05,700 --> 01:20:09,796
They ran some tests,
and they got the results,

1119
01:20:10,906 --> 01:20:12,965
and it was a heart attack.

1120
01:20:13,909 --> 01:20:16,673
-A mild one.
-Good. A start, at least.

1121
01:20:17,746 --> 01:20:21,238
I didn't wanna worry you
until you had a chance

1122
01:20:21,283 --> 01:20:23,911
to come to terms with what happened.

1123
01:20:24,619 --> 01:20:27,144
Well, you can worry me, all of you.

1124
01:20:27,622 --> 01:20:30,182
I'm a father of 4, I expect that.

1125
01:20:30,992 --> 01:20:35,156
I know you all have problems.

1126
01:20:36,798 --> 01:20:40,734
I know that, and I can see
you've been keeping things from me.

1127
01:20:42,170 --> 01:20:45,298
-But right now, there's something...
-Dad, maybe you should rest.

1128
01:20:45,340 --> 01:20:48,673
No, I will rest,
but I need an answer to a question.

1129
01:20:49,845 --> 01:20:54,145
You were honest with your mother,
and I want you to be honest with me.

1130
01:20:54,449 --> 01:20:57,850
It's all right. I'm okay.

1131
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:00,747
I can handle it.

1132
01:21:01,089 --> 01:21:04,320
I... I know David is in trouble,

1133
01:21:05,026 --> 01:21:07,654
and I just wanna know where he is

1134
01:21:09,397 --> 01:21:11,627
and how soon I can see him.

1135
01:21:14,669 --> 01:21:16,967
So who's gonna tell me?

1136
01:21:17,606 --> 01:21:20,598
Why don't you take it...
Why don't you rest for a while?

1137
01:21:22,544 --> 01:21:23,943
What is it?

1138
01:21:27,816 --> 01:21:29,750
Just tell me the truth.

1139
01:21:31,353 --> 01:21:32,911
Dad, I'm sorry.

1140
01:21:36,858 --> 01:21:41,090
David died, Dad. I'm sorry.

1141
01:21:44,065 --> 01:21:46,124
No, I... That's not true.

1142
01:21:46,534 --> 01:21:49,435
-Tell me that's not true.
-I'm sorry, Dad.

1143
01:21:50,572 --> 01:21:51,698
No.

1144
01:21:51,773 --> 01:21:54,571
He moved out of his apartment and...

1145
01:21:54,609 --> 01:21:55,667
No.

1146
01:21:55,710 --> 01:21:58,008
we knew that he was traveling.

1147
01:21:58,046 --> 01:22:01,140
And then we started getting calls
from Mexico.

1148
01:22:02,050 --> 01:22:06,578
There was a lot of confusion. We didn't
wanna tell you until we were sure.

1149
01:22:07,756 --> 01:22:10,020
No, no...

1150
01:22:10,425 --> 01:22:14,191
He had a lot of problems.
He wasn't happy, Dad.

1151
01:22:14,663 --> 01:22:18,190
He's been having a tough time
since Mom died.

1152
01:22:18,233 --> 01:22:20,201
We've all been worried about him.

1153
01:22:20,235 --> 01:22:24,968
Yeah, but not for sure. I...

1154
01:22:25,573 --> 01:22:29,509
It was Mexico. It could be anyone.
It could be a mistake.

1155
01:22:29,544 --> 01:22:32,809
-It could be.
-I flew out there after you visited.

1156
01:22:33,347 --> 01:22:35,941
I flew out there after you visited, and...

1157
01:22:36,484 --> 01:22:40,545
That's why you couldn't stay.
That's why we all made excuses and...

1158
01:22:40,588 --> 01:22:44,217
No. No...

1159
01:22:44,259 --> 01:22:46,819
Not my son. That's not my son.

1160
01:22:49,631 --> 01:22:50,723
How?

1161
01:22:53,768 --> 01:22:55,998
They said it was an overdose.

1162
01:23:04,045 --> 01:23:08,505
No, not my son. That's not my son.

1163
01:23:39,381 --> 01:23:40,780
What are you gonna do
when you grow up?

1164
01:23:40,815 --> 01:23:42,510
I wanna be a painter
and do my pictures.

1165
01:23:42,550 --> 01:23:44,450
No, not a painter.
Painters paint walls,

1166
01:23:44,486 --> 01:23:45,612
and dogs pee on walls.

1167
01:23:45,653 --> 01:23:48,850
You're gonna be an artist.
You gonna work hard?

1168
01:23:48,890 --> 01:23:51,450
-Yes, Dad.
-You gonna make me proud?

1169
01:23:59,100 --> 01:24:02,160
Sorry about
how everything's worked out, Dad.

1170
01:24:07,709 --> 01:24:09,506
It's not your fault.

1171
01:24:15,383 --> 01:24:18,944
I've been thinking about
what I wanna do when I grow up.

1172
01:24:19,554 --> 01:24:21,818
Yeah? And what did you decide?

1173
01:24:22,457 --> 01:24:27,053
I might still be an artist or I might
just do a normal job, like a painter.

1174
01:24:28,730 --> 01:24:30,960
I'd be proud of you
no matter what you did.

1175
01:24:30,999 --> 01:24:33,263
-Really?
-Really.

1176
01:24:36,071 --> 01:24:37,197
Good.

1177
01:24:40,975 --> 01:24:43,239
I told Mom I wouldn't be long.

1178
01:24:45,713 --> 01:24:48,876
-Give her my love.
-I will.

1179
01:24:51,986 --> 01:24:53,977
Well, I'll see you, Dad.

1180
01:24:56,291 --> 01:24:57,424
David?

1181
01:25:00,195 --> 01:25:01,560
I'm sorry.

1182
01:25:06,034 --> 01:25:08,059
It's not your fault, Dad.

1183
01:25:14,375 --> 01:25:15,569
David?

1184
01:25:19,981 --> 01:25:21,243
David?

1185
01:27:53,801 --> 01:27:55,234
Well, it was a big trip.

1186
01:27:56,838 --> 01:28:00,330
And if you ask me what I learned,
I'd have to tell you I'm not sure.

1187
01:28:01,776 --> 01:28:05,906
I know if I could do it all over again,
I would ask less of the kids.

1188
01:28:07,382 --> 01:28:10,874
As long as they were happy,
that would be fine with me.

1189
01:28:12,420 --> 01:28:15,321
I know I have to stop thinking of them
as if they're still children.

1190
01:28:15,356 --> 01:28:19,725
I can't tell them what to do anymore.
They have to find their own way.

1191
01:28:20,128 --> 01:28:23,564
And sometimes

1192
01:28:25,233 --> 01:28:26,325
you talked to me about things that

1193
01:28:26,367 --> 01:28:29,393
I should have listened to you
more carefully.

1194
01:28:30,071 --> 01:28:34,167
You presented me with the details
of our children's lives, and I...

1195
01:28:36,544 --> 01:28:38,603
I... I ignored them.

1196
01:28:41,049 --> 01:28:42,607
And for that...

1197
01:28:49,857 --> 01:28:51,586
But that isn't what you want to hear,
I know.

1198
01:28:51,626 --> 01:28:55,494
What you want is the news.
Well, the news is this.

1199
01:28:56,597 --> 01:29:00,693
Robert, Amy and Rosie promised
to visit me for the holidays,

1200
01:29:00,735 --> 01:29:03,670
and you know what?
This time I believe them.

1201
01:29:04,872 --> 01:29:06,305
And David...

1202
01:29:07,008 --> 01:29:08,441
David...

1203
01:29:10,378 --> 01:29:13,245
I hope he'll spend Christmas with you.

1204
01:29:19,821 --> 01:29:23,120
I went back to New York
to buy David's painting.

1205
01:29:25,293 --> 01:29:28,592
The portrait, I know which one
you mean, but I'm afraid it's sold.

1206
01:29:28,629 --> 01:29:30,028
It is sold?

1207
01:29:33,034 --> 01:29:34,399
Well...

1208
01:29:34,435 --> 01:29:37,563
-Were you familiar with the artist or...
-Yeah, I...

1209
01:29:37,605 --> 01:29:40,938
Yeah, not as much as I would
like to have been, but, yeah.

1210
01:29:40,975 --> 01:29:42,340
Thank you.

1211
01:29:42,577 --> 01:29:43,874
Why don't you give me your details?

1212
01:29:43,911 --> 01:29:46,641
If anything of David's comes in,
I'll let you know.

1213
01:29:48,683 --> 01:29:50,583
Excuse me?

1214
01:29:52,053 --> 01:29:55,079
I just saw your name. I'm stupid.
I should have realized.

1215
01:29:55,123 --> 01:29:56,556
That's okay.

1216
01:29:58,226 --> 01:29:59,591
I'm sorry.

1217
01:30:00,995 --> 01:30:04,453
You know, I knew David. He used to
hang out at the gallery all the time,

1218
01:30:04,499 --> 01:30:06,524
and he used to say
that if it wasn't for his dad,

1219
01:30:06,567 --> 01:30:09,229
that he never would have
become an artist.

1220
01:30:10,037 --> 01:30:11,902
He said he would have
ended up painting walls

1221
01:30:11,939 --> 01:30:14,100
and that dogs pee on walls.

1222
01:30:15,443 --> 01:30:19,777
Look, we might have something of his
in storage. I can check if you'd like.

1223
01:30:19,814 --> 01:30:21,839
-Okay, sure.
-Okay.

1224
01:30:22,483 --> 01:30:25,941
Now, I won't pretend
David's work was very commercial.

1225
01:30:26,554 --> 01:30:28,112
Here it is.

1226
01:30:29,490 --> 01:30:33,517
He had his own style,
and he wasn't concerned with fashion.

1227
01:30:41,135 --> 01:30:45,765
But for what it's worth,
I thought he was really special.

1228
01:31:03,558 --> 01:31:04,923
Thank you.

1229
01:31:14,168 --> 01:31:19,902
Hello, this is Frank. I'm not out...
I mean, I'm not here at the moment.

1230
01:31:20,808 --> 01:31:23,936
I'm probably out shopping
for the holidays.

1231
01:31:24,278 --> 01:31:27,270
But if you leave a message,
I will call you back. Thank you.

1232
01:31:29,350 --> 01:31:32,376
Don't laugh, but I promised to cook
the turkey for the first time this year.

1233
01:31:32,420 --> 01:31:35,287
I got the whole family coming.
What's the biggest bird you got?

1234
01:31:35,323 --> 01:31:36,654
Half a dozen of them.

1235
01:31:36,691 --> 01:31:38,921
And treat the children to some
expensive wine.

1236
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:42,327
-You got some reds on the right.
-Excellent choice, if I may say so, sir.

1237
01:31:42,530 --> 01:31:45,658
-That's the sale price. Yeah.
-It's the sale price?

1238
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:48,998
I'm even thinking
of replacing the old tree.

1239
01:31:49,036 --> 01:31:52,528
If I gave it to you for any cheaper,
I wouldn't be making any money.

1240
01:31:52,673 --> 01:31:55,870
Let me tighten it. It has to...
You're letting it droop too much.

1241
01:31:55,910 --> 01:31:59,175
I need a little more slack to
get around... How does this look?

1242
01:31:59,213 --> 01:32:01,613
-Dad's side's perfect.
-You kidding me?

1243
01:32:01,649 --> 01:32:02,946
Yours needs work.

1244
01:32:02,984 --> 01:32:04,281
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

1245
01:32:05,386 --> 01:32:06,910
-Thank you.
-What's that sound?

1246
01:32:09,190 --> 01:32:11,351
-What's that?
-Turkey.

1247
01:32:11,392 --> 01:32:13,758
-You're timing the turkey?
-Yeah.

1248
01:32:14,028 --> 01:32:15,825
That's so efficient.

1249
01:32:16,130 --> 01:32:17,893
Hey! Jesus!

1250
01:32:19,367 --> 01:32:21,130
Now you're...

1251
01:32:24,739 --> 01:32:26,798
It's not cooked yet, Dad.
I just checked it.

1252
01:32:26,841 --> 01:32:30,174
-You just checked it?
-Yeah, the juices are still red.

1253
01:32:31,445 --> 01:32:35,848
Well, why don't you stick
to the potatoes and I'll do the turkey?

1254
01:32:36,350 --> 01:32:37,476
Okay.

1255
01:32:43,691 --> 01:32:45,124
This is you!

1256
01:32:45,593 --> 01:32:49,552
Look, it has your name and
the 3rd grade written on its butt.

1257
01:32:49,764 --> 01:32:52,358
-Do you remember that?
-I remember when I made this.

1258
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:53,526
Yeah.

1259
01:32:55,536 --> 01:32:57,003
-Hey, Dad, are you okay?
-Yeah.

1260
01:32:57,038 --> 01:32:58,972
Check that turkey, Grandpa.

1261
01:33:03,878 --> 01:33:07,837
Dad, that's a big bird.
You'd better cook it properly.

1262
01:33:07,915 --> 01:33:09,382
-Just check the leg, Dad.
-Don't worry.

1263
01:33:09,417 --> 01:33:11,476
-Just to make sure.
-I will. I will.

1264
01:33:11,519 --> 01:33:14,454
Well, Mom actually would have cooked
it for at least another 30 minutes.

1265
01:33:14,488 --> 01:33:17,787
Yeah, well, there's something I need
to tell all of you about your mother.

1266
01:33:17,825 --> 01:33:20,089
As much as I loved her
and as a good cook as she was,

1267
01:33:20,127 --> 01:33:23,756
in all the 41 years we've been married,
she always over-cooked the turkey,

1268
01:33:23,798 --> 01:33:27,461
every single year.
I just never had the heart to tell her.

1269
01:33:29,303 --> 01:33:31,794
All right. Perfect.

1270
01:33:46,587 --> 01:33:49,317
Hi, honey.
Will you help me get him burped?

1271
01:33:49,357 --> 01:33:50,881
There we go.

1272
01:33:50,925 --> 01:33:52,722
This one's yours,
if you want, Robert.

1273
01:33:52,760 --> 01:33:55,354
Yeah, that would be great. Thanks.

1274
01:33:55,396 --> 01:33:58,422
-I'm kind of on a diet anyway.
-Good boy.

1275
01:33:58,666 --> 01:34:01,533
-Where's his tray?
-Grandpa, watch out.

1276
01:34:02,603 --> 01:34:04,935
Watch out. Okay, that's hot.

1277
01:34:07,041 --> 01:34:09,703
Your family is making its way
in the world,

1278
01:34:09,744 --> 01:34:13,510
and you can be proud of the children
and their achievements.

1279
01:34:14,715 --> 01:34:18,742
And, if you were to ask me,
I would have to say in all honesty,

1280
01:34:20,788 --> 01:34:23,256
-everybody's fine.
-Are you hungry?

1281
01:34:25,126 --> 01:34:26,525
Everybody's fine.

1282
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:28,888
-Babysitter.
-Yeah, I know.
