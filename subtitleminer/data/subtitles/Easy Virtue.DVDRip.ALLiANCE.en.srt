00:00:09,735 --> 00:00:13,011
(Man) Good evening.
Good evening, good evening.

2
00:00:13,135 --> 00:00:14,693
Hello, chaps.

3
00:00:14,815 --> 00:00:16,612
(Orchestra tuning up)

4
00:00:17,855 --> 00:00:19,732
Thank you for coming.

5
00:00:20,935 --> 00:00:25,531
Now then, we have a long way to go,
so... er... keep your powder dry.

6
00:00:25,655 --> 00:00:26,929
(Chuckling)

7
00:00:27,055 --> 00:00:30,007
Righty-ho...
settle down, now.

8
00:00:30,095 --> 00:00:31,608
(Taps baton)

9
00:00:34,335 --> 00:00:36,769
1... 2... 3...

10
00:00:36,895 --> 00:00:44,324
(Woman) # I'm mad about the boy

11
00:00:45,455 --> 00:00:51,132
# I know it's stupid to be
mad about the boy

12
00:00:52,775 --> 00:00:57,087
# I'm so ashamed of it,
but must admit

13
00:00:57,215 --> 00:01:03,893
# The sleepless nights
I've had about the boy

14
00:01:06,935 --> 00:01:10,564
# On the silver screen

15
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:16,486
# He melts my foolish heart
in every single scene

16
00:01:18,535 --> 00:01:21,208
# Although I'm quite aware

17
00:01:21,335 --> 00:01:29,367
# That here and there are traces...
of the cad about the boy

18
00:01:32,735 --> 00:01:37,445
# And Lord knows, I'm not a fool girl

19
00:01:39,335 --> 00:01:43,965
# I really shouldn't care

20
00:01:45,975 --> 00:01:49,604
# Lord knows, I'm not a schoolgirl

21
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:56,493
# In the flurry of her first affair

22
00:01:58,095 --> 00:02:07,128
# Will it ever cloy, this odd diversity
of misery and joy?

23
00:02:08,935 --> 00:02:13,611
# I'm feeling quite insane
and young again

24
00:02:13,735 --> 00:02:20,732
# And all because I'm mad
about the boy

25
00:02:35,015 --> 00:02:39,213
# I'm feeling quite insane
and young again

26
00:02:39,335 --> 00:02:44,045
# And all because I'm...

27
00:02:45,295 --> 00:02:50,927
#... mad about the boy #

28
00:02:58,415 --> 00:03:00,326
(Thunderclap)

29
00:03:06,055 --> 00:03:09,491
(Girl) She's the first lady racer.
- But she didn't actually win.

30
00:03:09,615 --> 00:03:13,813
She crossed the line first.
It's so exciting.

31
00:03:13,935 --> 00:03:16,210
Not nearly as exciting
as crossing your mother.

32
00:03:16,335 --> 00:03:18,724
I think we can all ignore that.

33
00:03:18,855 --> 00:03:21,767
Oh, what is that man doing?

34
00:03:25,975 --> 00:03:27,249
Jackson!

35
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:29,445
Madam?
- What did I tell you?

36
00:03:29,575 --> 00:03:33,614
Put the camellias by the front door
before the guests arrive!

37
00:03:33,735 --> 00:03:35,134
Furber.
- Madam?

38
00:03:35,255 --> 00:03:38,770
Salvage any of Jackson's appalling
pruning and send it to Mrs Holborough

39
00:03:38,895 --> 00:03:43,571
who's kindly offered up a leg of mutton
for dinner, which you'll fetch, Marion.

40
00:03:43,695 --> 00:03:46,573
But Reverend Burton has asked me
to drain the font.

41
00:03:46,695 --> 00:03:49,846
My hands are clearly full.
- I'll go.

42
00:03:49,975 --> 00:03:53,126
Uncle George has posted
the most grizzly clippings

43
00:03:53,255 --> 00:03:54,893
of the Valentine's Day Massacre!

44
00:03:55,015 --> 00:03:56,209
Hilda.

45
00:03:56,335 --> 00:04:00,726
Seven terrified men cut down
in a hail of automatic gun fire!

46
00:04:00,855 --> 00:04:04,928
Made worse by the strays that
came to lap the curdled blood.

47
00:04:05,055 --> 00:04:08,365
Hilda...
- The Devil Dogs! The Hounds of Hell!

48
00:04:08,495 --> 00:04:11,134
The leg of lamb! Now.

49
00:04:15,335 --> 00:04:20,489
Why we try and marry her off to gentry
when plainly she'd prefer an undertaker.

50
00:04:20,615 --> 00:04:24,449
Seating. I'm putting Sarah on your left
and Philip on your right,

51
00:04:24,575 --> 00:04:27,135
so please try and make an effort
to be civil.

52
00:04:27,255 --> 00:04:31,692
Right... I shall go and brush up
on my very small talk.

53
00:04:32,935 --> 00:04:35,085
(Marion) It might be an awkward meal.

54
00:04:35,215 --> 00:04:38,844
For all we know Sarah's grazing
in greener pastures.

55
00:04:38,975 --> 00:04:43,810
Whilst your brother sows his wild oats
in the South of France with his floozy?

56
00:04:43,935 --> 00:04:48,884
No. We'll keep the home fires burning
until his highness wanders home.

57
00:04:49,015 --> 00:04:50,733
Hmm. Like father did?

58
00:04:50,855 --> 00:04:53,323
Yes. Like your father did.

59
00:04:57,815 --> 00:04:59,806
(Grunting)

60
00:05:03,255 --> 00:05:05,371
(Hilda) I've got news, everybody!

61
00:05:06,215 --> 00:05:09,446
You all right, sir?
- No. Are you?

62
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:12,248
Coping, sir.
- Hear, hear. Well done.

63
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:15,208
Well done? They look like
they're waiting for a firing squad.

64
00:05:15,335 --> 00:05:19,533
Can't you make them more relaxed?
- Last meal and a cigarette, perhaps?

65
00:05:19,655 --> 00:05:23,694
I can't believe it. You'll never guess.

66
00:05:23,815 --> 00:05:27,524
Houdini escaped the Chinese water
torture only to die of a burst appendix.

67
00:05:27,655 --> 00:05:30,852
How ghastly!
Oh, and Mother's got a telegram.

68
00:05:32,135 --> 00:05:34,251
"Mr and Mrs Whittaker". Your mother.

69
00:05:35,575 --> 00:05:37,566
(Hilda) What's it say, Father?

70
00:05:38,495 --> 00:05:40,690
Perhaps your mother
should read this first.

71
00:05:40,815 --> 00:05:45,366
Oh! That stupid, stupid, stupid boy!

72
00:05:45,495 --> 00:05:48,293
(Hilda) What's happened?
Has there been an accident?

73
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:51,327
It's John, he's married that f-f-f...
- Francophile?

74
00:05:51,455 --> 00:05:53,764
F-f-f...
- Photographer?

75
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:56,489
Pharmacist?
- Why are you smirking?

76
00:05:56,615 --> 00:05:59,652
Deploying a smile. One member
of this family may actually be happy.

77
00:05:59,775 --> 00:06:03,324
Don't be absurd! We don't know
anything about this woman. Furber!

78
00:06:03,455 --> 00:06:05,093
Furber!

79
00:06:05,215 --> 00:06:07,683
Oh, not again!
- (Furber) Madam.

80
00:06:07,815 --> 00:06:09,806
Lord have mercy.

81
00:06:09,935 --> 00:06:13,405
Mister John is coming home with his...
with his wife.

82
00:06:13,535 --> 00:06:15,765
Yes. Their bags have just arrived.
Congratulations, Madam.

83
00:06:15,895 --> 00:06:19,604
I'll be the judge of that. Clear up this
mess and get Cook to send up a ham.

84
00:06:19,735 --> 00:06:23,569
This is from Dover. They'll be half way.
- Yes, Furber. Dress the mutton as ham.

85
00:06:23,695 --> 00:06:25,765
(Mrs Whittaker) Very sharp,
don't cut yourself.

86
00:06:25,895 --> 00:06:28,329
(Hilda) John married the floozy.
How exciting!

87
00:06:41,175 --> 00:06:45,487
# A room with a view and you

88
00:06:45,615 --> 00:06:48,413
# And no one to worry us

89
00:06:48,535 --> 00:06:54,246
# No one to hurry us through
...this dream we found #

90
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:56,684
(Tyres screech)

91
00:06:56,815 --> 00:07:00,251
There she blows.
Behold the country cottage.

92
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:02,366
Oh, Lord, it's enormous.

93
00:07:02,495 --> 00:07:06,283
So, I lied about gingerbread hedges
and obese little children.

94
00:07:06,415 --> 00:07:09,805
How hard to swim is the moat?
- Smoke and mirrors, darling.

95
00:07:09,935 --> 00:07:11,766
Smoke and mirrors.

96
00:07:14,135 --> 00:07:17,764
Oh, by the by, smoking... don't.
Apparently it wilts the azaleas.

97
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:21,410
That makes no sense. Speak English.
- All will be revealed, darling.

98
00:07:23,415 --> 00:07:27,852
Oh, give me back the wheel of my car.
I'm going back to Detroit!

99
00:07:32,975 --> 00:07:34,806
How romantic!

100
00:07:34,935 --> 00:07:37,972
Here they come! Oh, Furber!

101
00:07:38,095 --> 00:07:40,484
Mister John and his wife
are about to arrive.

102
00:07:40,615 --> 00:07:43,368
I can't see them.
- Your tunnel vision.

103
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:47,330
Ooh!

104
00:07:51,615 --> 00:07:54,493
Smile, Marion.
- I don't feel like smiling.

105
00:07:54,615 --> 00:07:56,128
You're English, dear. Fake it.

106
00:08:05,495 --> 00:08:08,726
(Jim) The prodigal son returns
in a blaze of gravel.

107
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:11,050
Father! You shaved.

108
00:08:13,655 --> 00:08:16,169
(Furber) Welcome, Madam.

109
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:18,934
(John) You look gorgeous.

110
00:08:19,055 --> 00:08:21,091
It's so lovely to see you.

111
00:08:25,575 --> 00:08:27,930
Oh, darling. Sorry, sorry!

112
00:08:30,495 --> 00:08:32,884
This is my wife, Larita.

113
00:08:33,935 --> 00:08:37,086
Mrs Whittaker, the pleasure is all mine.

114
00:08:37,215 --> 00:08:38,694
Oh, you're American.

115
00:08:38,815 --> 00:08:41,454
And very welcome. Jim Whittaker.
- (John) This is my father.

116
00:08:41,575 --> 00:08:44,089
I fought alongside many
of your countrymen, Larita,

117
00:08:44,215 --> 00:08:46,775
and I must say it's an honour
to have a comrade in the family.

118
00:08:46,895 --> 00:08:49,932
Thank you.
I do hope I'm not a disappointment.

119
00:08:50,055 --> 00:08:52,410
Far from it.
- And my two little blisters.

120
00:08:52,535 --> 00:08:54,127
Hilda and Marion.

121
00:08:54,255 --> 00:08:56,815
Aren't you the woman
who won the Grand Prix?

122
00:08:56,935 --> 00:08:58,527
First place, before disqualification.

123
00:08:58,655 --> 00:09:02,489
Apparently you need chest hair
to change gears in Monaco.

124
00:09:02,615 --> 00:09:06,369
I saw you in the paper.
I cut your head out. I could just die!

125
00:09:06,495 --> 00:09:08,008
(Giggling)

126
00:09:08,135 --> 00:09:11,923
Furber, that suitcase
to the drawing room, and do be careful.

127
00:09:12,055 --> 00:09:15,047
Marion... Golly, you're not a bit
like what we imagined.

128
00:09:15,175 --> 00:09:17,973
Somewhat older, I expect.
Awfully sorry about that.

129
00:09:20,615 --> 00:09:22,810
(Jim) Before the frostbite sets in...

130
00:09:22,935 --> 00:09:27,053
I'm looking forward to getting acquainted
with the mother of my "Panda".

131
00:09:27,175 --> 00:09:30,087
You'll find me quite uncomplicated,
I'm afraid.

132
00:09:30,215 --> 00:09:32,126
Oh! What are you doing?

133
00:09:32,255 --> 00:09:34,325
Carrying you over the finish line.

134
00:09:38,215 --> 00:09:41,173
Venus de Milo meet my Venus Detroit.

135
00:09:41,295 --> 00:09:42,774
Oh, hello.

136
00:09:42,895 --> 00:09:45,125
Mother's turned our old nursery
into a boudoir.

137
00:09:45,255 --> 00:09:47,246
I wouldn't exactly call
it a boudoir, Hilda.

138
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:50,412
Marvellous. All those grubby memories
of Little Johnnie.

139
00:09:50,535 --> 00:09:52,526
(Marion) We had no time
to raid the hothouse.

140
00:09:52,655 --> 00:09:54,805
I only hope we can make you
comfortable.

141
00:09:54,935 --> 00:09:58,007
Don't go to any trouble.
We're only staying a few days.

142
00:10:00,255 --> 00:10:02,325
Aren't we, Johnnie?
- Of course.

143
00:10:02,455 --> 00:10:04,650
And for our next surprise...

144
00:10:08,415 --> 00:10:11,168
What on earth is that?

145
00:10:12,415 --> 00:10:14,849
His master's voice!
A wedding gift from us to you all.

146
00:10:14,975 --> 00:10:18,445
(Hilda) How divine! You should've
got married years ago!

147
00:10:18,575 --> 00:10:25,253
#... another June,
another sunny honeymoon

148
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:31,245
# Another season, another reason
for making whoopee... #

149
00:10:33,335 --> 00:10:35,565
Come on, little blister. Twirl for me.

150
00:10:35,695 --> 00:10:37,765
(They speak French)

151
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:46,051
Oh, a Continental education.
Not all of us have been so fortunate.

152
00:10:46,175 --> 00:10:49,212
An emotional depiction of the French
postal service, Mrs Whittaker.

153
00:10:49,335 --> 00:10:52,054
Come now, not Mrs Whittaker.
It's "Mother" now.

154
00:10:52,175 --> 00:10:54,928
I don't think we're quite ready
for that yet.

155
00:10:55,055 --> 00:11:01,005
Since time is so clearly against us, why
don't you show Larita up to the nursery?

156
00:11:01,135 --> 00:11:03,524
Dinner's at 8:00.

157
00:11:03,655 --> 00:11:06,567
You didn't tell them?
- One bombshell at a time, darling.

158
00:11:06,695 --> 00:11:11,052
That's not fair! Your poor mother.
How long are we staying?

159
00:11:11,175 --> 00:11:13,006
A few days?

160
00:11:13,135 --> 00:11:17,765
I shoulder the shortcomings of this family
and what do I get in return? A few days!

161
00:11:17,895 --> 00:11:20,489
Look at her. What am I supposed
to do with the bauble of a woman?

162
00:11:20,615 --> 00:11:22,685
Hang her?
- I think she's splendid.

163
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:26,251
Do you, Hilda? Well, we can all relax.
- She's not what I expected.

164
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:28,047
(Mrs Whittaker) She's exactly
what I expected.

165
00:11:28,175 --> 00:11:31,485
Surely not exactly? She wasn't drunk.
- Oh, very funny, Jim.

166
00:11:31,615 --> 00:11:35,085
Reduce this to the burlesque.
- She looks so expensive!

167
00:11:35,215 --> 00:11:37,570
(Mrs Whittaker) Very.
- Hmm. I like her.

168
00:11:37,695 --> 00:11:40,289
Yes, Jim. We all know what you like.

169
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,734
Mother!

170
00:11:48,295 --> 00:11:50,763
Oh, we have all been sent
to our "wombs".

171
00:11:52,975 --> 00:11:55,967
And so toasty.
- Economics in action.

172
00:11:56,095 --> 00:11:58,928
She keeps half the house closed
to save on heating.

173
00:11:59,055 --> 00:12:01,569
That explains the frosty reception.

174
00:12:01,695 --> 00:12:04,892
Well, darling. Let me warm you up.

175
00:12:14,095 --> 00:12:15,687
(Giggling)

176
00:12:15,815 --> 00:12:17,453
(Screams)

177
00:12:17,575 --> 00:12:19,850
(Laughing)

178
00:12:26,455 --> 00:12:29,253
Well?
- She's lovely, I'm very proud of you.

179
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:31,127
Thanks, Father.

180
00:12:31,255 --> 00:12:35,248
John? How long is a few days?

181
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:38,333
Mother, Larita and I would like
to find a home in London.

182
00:12:38,455 --> 00:12:42,004
But this is your home.
- A home of their own.

183
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:46,250
But Panda, we need you here.

184
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:50,573
Since you went off around the Riviera,
we've had to let go of six more people.

185
00:12:50,695 --> 00:12:52,845
If you'd just listened to me
and taken on some machinery.

186
00:12:52,975 --> 00:12:56,251
Wouldn't that be a good idea? I could
run the entire estate single-handedly.

187
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:59,924
Congratulations on your insight
and your spontaneity.

188
00:13:00,055 --> 00:13:03,206
Sarah and Philip are coming to dinner
tonight, and I have got a table plan

189
00:13:03,335 --> 00:13:05,565
that will take the League
of Nations to unravel.

190
00:13:05,695 --> 00:13:10,450
Tonight? That's absolutely splendid!
- Don't be so fickle in your affections.

191
00:13:10,575 --> 00:13:12,770
Sarah might not be
as accommodating as you expect.

192
00:13:12,895 --> 00:13:14,772
Codswallop. She'll be delighted.

193
00:13:14,895 --> 00:13:18,888
If mother was so desperate for her hand
in marriage, she should've asked herself!

194
00:13:19,015 --> 00:13:21,085
Strange as it may seem,
I agree with your sister.

195
00:13:21,215 --> 00:13:22,887
I think you're wrong.

196
00:13:23,015 --> 00:13:26,291
On certain things, yes. Call her.

197
00:13:26,415 --> 00:13:28,053
Really?
- (Jim) Really.

198
00:13:28,175 --> 00:13:32,248
Really! If Edgar were here,
he'd do the manly thing.

199
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:34,764
What? Run away?

200
00:13:38,695 --> 00:13:40,447
Here they come!

201
00:13:54,295 --> 00:13:58,004
And the chequered flag goes to...
Fast work, John!

202
00:13:58,135 --> 00:14:02,128
I should've written, but it happened
so fast, I didn't know where I was.

203
00:14:02,255 --> 00:14:04,371
In Larita's arms, it seems.

204
00:14:04,495 --> 00:14:07,646
Please don't be disappointed.
- Of course I'm disappointed.

205
00:14:07,775 --> 00:14:10,573
But tell me you're happy,
and I'll tell you you're forgiven.

206
00:14:10,695 --> 00:14:14,165
# You're the top,
you're Mahatma Gandhi! #

207
00:14:14,295 --> 00:14:16,763
Panda, don't break out
the brandy just yet.

208
00:14:16,895 --> 00:14:18,567
The hell we're not.

209
00:14:18,695 --> 00:14:22,608
Have I missed something?
- Let sleeping cows stand.

210
00:14:22,735 --> 00:14:24,566
Oh, you plonker!

211
00:14:24,695 --> 00:14:27,653
Rule one, push sleeping cow.

212
00:14:27,775 --> 00:14:30,084
Rule two, get out of the way.

213
00:14:30,215 --> 00:14:32,683
Rule three, remember rule two.

214
00:14:32,815 --> 00:14:35,283
(Mrs Whittaker) Sarah!
It's so lovely to see you.

215
00:14:35,415 --> 00:14:37,610
I hear your poor father
is not having a good day.

216
00:14:37,735 --> 00:14:40,203
I'm afraid not. He sends his love.

217
00:14:40,335 --> 00:14:43,611
You are a jolly good sport,
turning up like this, that's all I can say.

218
00:14:43,735 --> 00:14:46,852
I wouldn't miss it for the world.
Larita is such a pretty name.

219
00:14:46,975 --> 00:14:50,251
Yes. Excellent for musical comedy.
Hilda!

220
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:53,367
I hear the cow's in a terrible way.
- I've sent flowers.

221
00:14:53,495 --> 00:14:55,611
(John) And did she eat them?
(Philip) Touché!

222
00:14:55,735 --> 00:14:57,487
Good evening to you all.

223
00:14:58,295 --> 00:15:00,251
Nobody told me tonight
was fancy dress!

224
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:03,287
Then why have you come
as the village idiot?

225
00:15:03,415 --> 00:15:04,643
(Ripping)

226
00:15:04,775 --> 00:15:07,084
(Hilda) I think I'm snagged.

227
00:15:07,215 --> 00:15:09,365
(Larita) Let me help you with that.

228
00:15:11,975 --> 00:15:13,647
Holy mother!

229
00:15:14,815 --> 00:15:19,809
Panda? You're forgiven... tenfold.

230
00:15:24,975 --> 00:15:30,845
Sarah Hurst, I'd like to introduce
my wife, Larita Whittaker.

231
00:15:30,975 --> 00:15:33,887
Gosh, I do like the sound of that.

232
00:15:34,015 --> 00:15:36,131
Sarah... finally.

233
00:15:36,255 --> 00:15:39,725
Johnnie talks about you constantly.
- How very annoying for you.

234
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:44,690
I hope we can be friends.
- We already are. Congratulations.

235
00:15:44,815 --> 00:15:47,693
Er... I'd like to be friends, too.

236
00:15:47,815 --> 00:15:51,330
Larita, my tiresome brother...
- The dishonourable Philip Hurst.

237
00:15:51,455 --> 00:15:53,764
(Philip) Charmed, my dear lady.
(Larita) Indeed.

238
00:15:53,895 --> 00:15:56,204
Philip, won't you escort me in?

239
00:15:56,335 --> 00:15:59,452
Of course,
my beautiful, little Sausage Fingers.

240
00:15:59,575 --> 00:16:02,089
That's whet my appetite.
Shall we adjourn to the dining room?

241
00:16:02,215 --> 00:16:04,126
And toast my beautiful bride.

242
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:06,849
Had we known there was to be
a wedding reception,

243
00:16:06,975 --> 00:16:09,364
we could've lashed out on taffeta!

244
00:16:09,495 --> 00:16:13,170
She's a lot like drowning:
quite pleasant once you stop struggling.

245
00:16:13,295 --> 00:16:17,334
(Mrs Whittaker) So, John, was Larita's
family able to attend the wedding?

246
00:16:17,455 --> 00:16:20,606
(Raucous laughter)

247
00:16:23,895 --> 00:16:25,408
More cabbage, Madam?

248
00:16:25,535 --> 00:16:28,049
There's lots to do, Larita.
You ride, don't you?

249
00:16:28,175 --> 00:16:30,405
Boats, cars or planes?

250
00:16:30,535 --> 00:16:33,845
No, horses, silly.
- (Larita) Ah, yes, horses.

251
00:16:33,975 --> 00:16:36,569
Faulty steering and unreliable brakes.

252
00:16:37,855 --> 00:16:39,732
I'm stealing that for Stirrup Cup!

253
00:16:39,855 --> 00:16:41,811
Stirrup what?
- Cup.

254
00:16:41,935 --> 00:16:44,574
Every November, Philip and Sarah's
family host the hunt.

255
00:16:44,695 --> 00:16:46,845
Wait until you meet their father,
Lord Hurst, he's terrific.

256
00:16:46,975 --> 00:16:50,650
And Lady Hurst?
- Was terrific, until she... stopped.

257
00:16:52,655 --> 00:16:54,407
Stopped what?
- Living.

258
00:16:55,415 --> 00:16:57,690
Oh, I'm very sorry to hear that.

259
00:16:58,775 --> 00:17:03,291
Between father's polio
and Philip's mania for tipping cows...

260
00:17:03,415 --> 00:17:05,292
Can we please just drop the cows?

261
00:17:05,415 --> 00:17:07,804
I think we'll give the fox a break
this year.

262
00:17:07,935 --> 00:17:12,133
Oh, no hunt? Mrs Winston gave me
her saddle. I've had a wax.

263
00:17:12,255 --> 00:17:13,688
(Gulps)

264
00:17:13,815 --> 00:17:16,932
Your father and I conspired to make
John the Master of the Hunt.

265
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:20,172
People come from far and wide.
It's such a shame to disappoint them.

266
00:17:20,295 --> 00:17:21,967
Very thoughtful, Mother.

267
00:17:22,095 --> 00:17:24,689
(Mrs Whittaker) You do hunt,
I take it, Larita?

268
00:17:24,815 --> 00:17:27,773
Hypocrites, gossips
or defenceless animals?

269
00:17:27,895 --> 00:17:29,123
(Philip) Bravo!

270
00:17:29,255 --> 00:17:31,211
(John) You wouldn't get her to the start.

271
00:17:31,335 --> 00:17:34,805
We have another
conscientious objector, Father.

272
00:17:34,935 --> 00:17:39,008
Company! Do you object to the circus
or the slaughter, Major?

273
00:17:39,135 --> 00:17:41,444
I support Sheppard's position
on pacifism.

274
00:17:41,575 --> 00:17:45,284
Good for you.
So, when does the carnage begin?

275
00:17:45,415 --> 00:17:48,930
After the War Widow's Revue,
but before the craft fair,

276
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:50,852
in between the Dog Show and the shoot.

277
00:17:50,975 --> 00:17:55,127
Don't forget the highlight. Mother's
Christmas dance is the hot ticket.

278
00:17:55,255 --> 00:17:58,292
She's ordered the most exquisite
Japanese lanterns.

279
00:17:58,415 --> 00:18:00,883
From Japan?
- No, Fortnum & Mason's.

280
00:18:01,015 --> 00:18:04,530
Oh, yes.
Prepare for a whirlwind, Larita.

281
00:18:05,855 --> 00:18:07,493
I'm breathless already.

282
00:18:11,255 --> 00:18:14,292
(Larita) I won't make it to Christmas.
(John) You won't need to.

283
00:18:14,415 --> 00:18:16,849
(Larita) I won't make it to breakfast!
What were we just eating?

284
00:18:16,975 --> 00:18:19,443
The lumpy grey and beige concoction?

285
00:18:19,575 --> 00:18:23,534
Oh, yes. That's the word
I was looking for..."greige".

286
00:18:23,655 --> 00:18:26,931
Absolutely no idea.
But it is the speciality of the house.

287
00:18:27,055 --> 00:18:30,206
Incoming! Have you met my namesake?
He's very good in bed.

288
00:18:30,335 --> 00:18:32,895
Shh! They'll hear you.
- I don't care.

289
00:18:33,015 --> 00:18:34,573
I do.

290
00:18:35,775 --> 00:18:38,414
I know we need the heat,
but please don't smoke.

291
00:18:38,535 --> 00:18:40,810
Mother's clairvoyant about these things.

292
00:18:40,935 --> 00:18:43,290
She loathes me, Johnnie.

293
00:18:43,415 --> 00:18:46,805
I'm a gold-digger, burrowing in
from the land of opportunists.

294
00:18:48,215 --> 00:18:50,604
Your father's an interesting study,
though.

295
00:18:50,735 --> 00:18:52,726
Quietly sardonic. I like that in a man.

296
00:18:52,855 --> 00:18:56,006
That won't earn you many
brownie points under this roof.

297
00:18:57,575 --> 00:19:01,011
After the Armistice,
Father didn't come straight home.

298
00:19:01,135 --> 00:19:04,411
He caroused around France and Italy,
drinking, having affairs...

299
00:19:04,535 --> 00:19:07,845
A lot of men did similar...
couldn't settle down.

300
00:19:07,975 --> 00:19:11,206
Why didn't she go after him?
- A question of pride.

301
00:19:11,335 --> 00:19:13,371
He finally just wandered home.

302
00:19:13,495 --> 00:19:16,567
Still a bit of a sore point.
We try not to speak about it.

303
00:19:16,695 --> 00:19:18,048
Except in public.

304
00:19:18,175 --> 00:19:20,973
You see, she feels
she's missed out on something.

305
00:19:21,095 --> 00:19:23,563
Which means, of course,
she's missed out on everything.

306
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:27,005
Exactly. The war robbed her
of all her expectations.

307
00:19:27,135 --> 00:19:29,729
She takes one look
at a woman like you...

308
00:19:29,855 --> 00:19:32,972
The harlot stealing into the nursery...

309
00:19:33,095 --> 00:19:35,165
The delicious concubine...

310
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:37,206
...with the delectable ears...

311
00:19:37,975 --> 00:19:39,408
...nose...

312
00:19:39,935 --> 00:19:41,334
...neck.

313
00:19:43,095 --> 00:19:44,528
I could just...

314
00:19:45,855 --> 00:19:47,254
...eat you.

315
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:49,684
After that meal I'm not surprised.

316
00:19:57,655 --> 00:20:02,331
# '... I'm mad about the boy! ' #

317
00:20:11,015 --> 00:20:13,051
(Larita gasps)

318
00:20:15,935 --> 00:20:18,403
(Erotic moaning)

319
00:20:27,095 --> 00:20:29,131
(Moaning)

320
00:20:31,095 --> 00:20:32,892
(Groaning)

321
00:20:35,095 --> 00:20:38,087
(Panting and moaning)

322
00:20:41,775 --> 00:20:46,246
Dear Lord, thank you for bringing
John and his floozy home safely.

323
00:20:51,455 --> 00:20:53,491
(Sighs heavily)

324
00:20:54,575 --> 00:20:57,567
(Larita) 'Hmm... John! '

325
00:21:06,135 --> 00:21:09,684
Why is Larita always so late?
- You can't hurry perfection.

326
00:21:09,815 --> 00:21:14,013
Edgar was never late for a meal.
- (John) He's missed a few lately.

327
00:21:14,135 --> 00:21:17,571
(Larita) Good morning.
How are we all on this glorious day?

328
00:21:17,695 --> 00:21:21,244
There she is! Morning, darling.

329
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:22,933
(Dog yaps)

330
00:21:24,095 --> 00:21:26,211
What would Madam like for breakfast?

331
00:21:26,935 --> 00:21:29,847
I think Madam will get more sustenance
from a kipper.

332
00:21:29,975 --> 00:21:33,092
But it won't be as much fun.
- Aren't you riding with us?

333
00:21:33,215 --> 00:21:35,445
Darling, I think it's about high time

334
00:21:35,575 --> 00:21:39,363
that your mother and I have
an intimate tête-à-tête.

335
00:21:39,495 --> 00:21:42,805
Just us girls.
- Lovely.

336
00:21:42,935 --> 00:21:45,244
(John) What a frightening thought.

337
00:21:47,535 --> 00:21:54,452
Two hemispheres under one roof.
Papua New Guinea, India, the Argentine.

338
00:21:57,855 --> 00:22:00,653
I may not have travelled,
but the world has come to me.

339
00:22:00,775 --> 00:22:03,892
(Sneezes)
- Are you coming down with something?

340
00:22:04,015 --> 00:22:07,087
Pollen.
But if I hold my breath long enough...

341
00:22:07,215 --> 00:22:08,887
How peculiar.

342
00:22:09,015 --> 00:22:11,210
Which is why we should
get to know one another.

343
00:22:11,335 --> 00:22:14,133
(Mrs Whittaker) Where does one start?
- Shall I make headway?

344
00:22:14,255 --> 00:22:17,691
I was born in Detroit.
My father worked in the steel plant.

345
00:22:17,815 --> 00:22:20,375
He was one of the first
lured over to Henry Ford.

346
00:22:20,495 --> 00:22:22,406
Ah, hence the love of motoring?

347
00:22:22,535 --> 00:22:24,890
Yes, but I also love animals.

348
00:22:25,015 --> 00:22:27,085
I am a city girl.
I take chickens to the vet.

349
00:22:27,215 --> 00:22:28,773
Oh!

350
00:22:28,895 --> 00:22:32,854
You can't be squeamish about livestock
now that you are living in the country.

351
00:22:32,975 --> 00:22:34,966
Which was never my intention.

352
00:22:35,095 --> 00:22:37,848
I was happily carving out a niche
for myself on the race circuit

353
00:22:37,975 --> 00:22:42,093
when I was unexpectedly flagged down
by someone irresistible.

354
00:22:43,815 --> 00:22:47,524
Remarrying was the farthest thing
from my mind.

355
00:22:47,655 --> 00:22:49,327
(Sneezes)

356
00:22:49,455 --> 00:22:51,093
I see...

357
00:22:53,535 --> 00:22:55,207
May I ask?

358
00:22:56,095 --> 00:22:59,531
Oh, dead, unfortunately. No children.

359
00:22:59,655 --> 00:23:03,489
Oh...
How disappointing for you.

360
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:05,890
Still, he provided well, though?

361
00:23:06,015 --> 00:23:10,611
Yes, but there were a lot of hidden costs
associated with his passing.

362
00:23:10,735 --> 00:23:15,525
Oh, that beautiful motor car... Surely,
you must have independent means?

363
00:23:15,655 --> 00:23:18,249
I'm more than happy
to discuss my means,

364
00:23:18,375 --> 00:23:20,570
but I think you'll be a tad disappointed.

365
00:23:20,695 --> 00:23:22,970
The car is my sole source of income.

366
00:23:23,095 --> 00:23:26,132
Which makes living in London
an imperative.

367
00:23:26,255 --> 00:23:28,644
But what will John do in the city?

368
00:23:28,775 --> 00:23:31,050
Work. It's not uncommon.

369
00:23:31,175 --> 00:23:32,767
Oh!

370
00:23:33,815 --> 00:23:36,773
John was brought up in the country,
Larita.

371
00:23:36,895 --> 00:23:38,931
Where will he work?

372
00:23:39,055 --> 00:23:42,809
Chalk Farm, perhaps?
Or St-Martin-In-The-Fields?

373
00:23:42,935 --> 00:23:47,213
I know this is not perfect so that's
why I'm asking for your guidance.

374
00:23:47,335 --> 00:23:50,486
So, please, how can I make this
pleasant for everybody?

375
00:23:50,615 --> 00:23:55,245
Well, erm... wartime experience dictates
that you keep your head down

376
00:23:55,375 --> 00:23:57,252
and you fit in as well as you can.

377
00:23:57,375 --> 00:24:01,926
Oh, there's a war on?
- Oh, no... not necessarily.

378
00:24:02,815 --> 00:24:05,852
Australian mimosa. Mmm... beautiful.

379
00:24:07,095 --> 00:24:09,290
(Sneezes)
- Oh...

380
00:24:14,095 --> 00:24:18,134
And then the British troops opened fire...
How grizzly!

381
00:24:18,255 --> 00:24:21,611
How'd it go, Mother?
- Oh, marvellous!

382
00:24:21,735 --> 00:24:22,929
Marvellous.

383
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:28,649
(# Brass band version of "Car Wash")

384
00:24:28,775 --> 00:24:30,766
(Woman) Thanks for the invitation!

385
00:24:34,095 --> 00:24:36,848
(Laughing and chatting)

386
00:24:38,495 --> 00:24:40,372
Thanks for the invitation!

387
00:24:40,495 --> 00:24:42,929
(Man) Oh, it's Lord Hurst!

388
00:24:43,055 --> 00:24:45,853
I fear storm clouds are gathering,
Mrs Whit.

389
00:24:45,975 --> 00:24:48,011
Stop being maudlin, Father.

390
00:24:48,135 --> 00:24:50,205
It's the future!
- (John) Spanner!

391
00:24:50,335 --> 00:24:54,613
Father, allow me to introduce
Panda's new chauffeuse.

392
00:24:54,735 --> 00:24:58,250
Lovely La-La-Larita.
- (John) Watch it, Philip.

393
00:24:58,375 --> 00:25:01,606
My son is prone to fabrication,
but I can see on this occasion

394
00:25:01,735 --> 00:25:04,329
he has been perfectly frank,
Mrs Whittaker.

395
00:25:05,415 --> 00:25:09,249
Yes, that's right.
There are two of us now.

396
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:11,969
(Philip) No shortage of wits
around here any more.

397
00:25:12,095 --> 00:25:15,485
OK, stand back! I give you, the future!

398
00:25:16,495 --> 00:25:18,292
(Engine revs)

399
00:25:19,815 --> 00:25:22,648
(Hurst) All right, John.
You can take my baby out for a spin.

400
00:25:22,775 --> 00:25:24,174
(Sneezes)

401
00:25:24,295 --> 00:25:27,571
Ha-ha! Allergies.
She inflates like a puffer fish.

402
00:25:27,695 --> 00:25:30,129
You just want to squeeze her
until she pops.

403
00:25:30,255 --> 00:25:32,928
#... working at the car wash

404
00:25:37,255 --> 00:25:39,564
# You might not ever strike it rich

405
00:25:41,135 --> 00:25:44,093
# But let me tell you,
it's better than digging a ditch

406
00:25:44,215 --> 00:25:47,491
# Working at the car wash!

407
00:25:47,615 --> 00:25:50,209
# Working at the car wash, man

408
00:25:50,335 --> 00:25:52,974
# Come on, now, sing it to me

409
00:25:53,975 --> 00:25:56,489
# It's better than digging a ditch... #

410

(Bell rings)

411
00:26:01,615 --> 00:26:03,367
(Bell rings)

412
00:26:07,975 --> 00:26:10,694
The missus is a bit trigger-happy
this week.

413
00:26:10,815 --> 00:26:12,692
Bleeding tinnitus is killing me.

414
00:26:12,815 --> 00:26:16,933
I like the new Mrs Whit. Reminds me
of the old one before the war.

415
00:26:17,055 --> 00:26:20,127
Only more reasonable. You can tell
she's run her own household.

416
00:26:20,255 --> 00:26:21,893
Oh, be silent!

417
00:26:22,015 --> 00:26:25,644
Good morning,
Furber, Jackson, Millie, and?

418
00:26:25,775 --> 00:26:28,448
Cook, I can't call you a verb.
Your name?

419
00:26:29,255 --> 00:26:30,654
Beatrice.

420
00:26:34,055 --> 00:26:37,934
All right, all right... it's Doris.
Sorry, Madam.

421
00:26:38,055 --> 00:26:40,489
Always wanted to be called Beatrice.

422
00:26:40,615 --> 00:26:45,086
Well, Beatrice, would you mind
if I helped myself in the mornings?

423
00:26:45,215 --> 00:26:48,207
I fear I shall be rising later and later.

424
00:26:48,335 --> 00:26:50,724
Well... if it pleases, Mrs Whit.

425
00:26:52,855 --> 00:26:54,652
The point of the bell?

426
00:26:54,775 --> 00:26:57,847
When I ring it, you come to me,
not the other way round!

427
00:26:58,935 --> 00:27:00,971
Larita. May I have a word?

428
00:27:02,135 --> 00:27:03,773
Come along!

429
00:27:06,575 --> 00:27:09,373
Would you please refrain
from chatting to the staff?

430
00:27:09,495 --> 00:27:12,134
It's chore enough trying to keep
this motley crew together.

431
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:16,168
I had a brilliant French maid in Paris.
Perhaps I should send for her?

432
00:27:16,295 --> 00:27:18,604
Thank you, no... erm...

433
00:27:18,735 --> 00:27:22,933
I'd prefer to keep English
the first language in this household.

434
00:27:23,055 --> 00:27:24,613
Ah, there you are.

435
00:27:24,735 --> 00:27:27,124
(Mock English accent)
I say! Anyone for tennis?

436
00:27:27,255 --> 00:27:28,529
Yes. You!

437
00:27:28,655 --> 00:27:30,964
John, Shackleton wouldn't let
a dog out today!

438
00:27:31,095 --> 00:27:33,086
The fog has lifted
and Whittakers don't do winter.

439
00:27:33,215 --> 00:27:36,332
You go ahead, darling.
I'll play with myself.

440
00:27:36,455 --> 00:27:39,447
No, really. I'm a lot of fun.
- Ooh...

441
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:42,169
(Philip) John!
It's brass monkeys out here!

442
00:27:45,855 --> 00:27:49,291
Day one of the Antarctic Open.
Mister Whittaker to serve.

443
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:52,373
(Screams)

444
00:27:52,495 --> 00:27:54,611
(Philip) Hole in one!
- Deuce.

445
00:27:54,735 --> 00:27:58,523
(Philip) I see your pair of deuces
and I raise you a tenner.

446
00:27:58,655 --> 00:28:01,488
The Titanic could have hit that!

447
00:28:01,615 --> 00:28:05,369
Sarah, you're an embarrassment to
the family name. I'll have you killed.

448
00:28:05,495 --> 00:28:09,044
Good God! What's wrong with you?
No! Stop now!

449
00:28:09,175 --> 00:28:12,247
Stop, everybody! Listen!
- (Sarah) Shoot the court jester!

450
00:28:12,375 --> 00:28:16,163
(John) Nice backhand!
- (Philip) Is that a backhand compliment?

451
00:28:16,295 --> 00:28:19,367
# Mad dogs and Englishmen
go out in the midday sun!

452
00:28:19,495 --> 00:28:22,851
# The Japanese don't care to,
the Chinese wouldn't dare to

453
00:28:22,975 --> 00:28:25,773
# Hindus and Argentines sleep firmly
from twelve to one

454
00:28:25,895 --> 00:28:29,092
# But Englishmen detest a siesta... #

455
00:28:29,215 --> 00:28:32,571
(Philip) Laurel and Hardy step up
to the crease. The fillies are lining up.

456
00:28:32,695 --> 00:28:36,324
Miss Hilda Whittaker looking most
fetching in her feed bag and bridle!

457
00:28:42,855 --> 00:28:44,925
One woman's heaven...

458
00:28:46,255 --> 00:28:48,052
Oh, she's absolutely beautiful.

459
00:28:50,295 --> 00:28:53,810
Broken, tarnished
and completely useless.

460
00:28:55,055 --> 00:28:58,934
Things guaranteed
to keep my wife at bay.

461
00:28:59,055 --> 00:29:00,693
May I?

462
00:29:00,815 --> 00:29:03,124
If you don't mind
getting your hands dirty.

463
00:29:03,255 --> 00:29:06,930
In Detroit, what we lack in dirt,
we make up for in filth.

464
00:29:07,055 --> 00:29:10,047
Your first husband
from that neck of the woods?

465
00:29:10,175 --> 00:29:12,564
Oh... well, word gets about.

466
00:29:14,775 --> 00:29:17,448
So where is he now?
- Dead.

467
00:29:19,535 --> 00:29:21,332
Cancer.

468
00:29:21,455 --> 00:29:23,685
He was a fair bit older than me.

469
00:29:23,815 --> 00:29:27,410
I spent a while playing the unmerry
widow but the black wore thin.

470
00:29:28,255 --> 00:29:31,804
You didn't care for him, I gather?
- I cared too much.

471
00:29:31,935 --> 00:29:35,610
Life was just such an unpleasant
experience for the man, I...

472
00:29:36,175 --> 00:29:39,326
I'd be a liar to say I wasn't glad
when he was relieved of it.

473
00:29:39,455 --> 00:29:42,652
(Jim speaks French)

474
00:29:47,575 --> 00:29:50,806
When were you last in France?
- Just after the war?

475
00:29:50,935 --> 00:29:52,812
On a personal reconnaissance,

476
00:29:52,935 --> 00:29:57,565
trying to ascertain what exactly
all those fine young men had died for.

477
00:29:59,135 --> 00:30:01,774
Apparently, I'm of the romantic
Lost Generation.

478
00:30:03,015 --> 00:30:04,687
What did you lose?

479
00:30:05,655 --> 00:30:07,646
I'm not sure.

480
00:30:10,135 --> 00:30:12,285
(# Gramophone playing)

481
00:30:56,135 --> 00:30:57,807
(Dog yaps)

482
00:31:03,455 --> 00:31:05,810
Oh, hello... hello.

483
00:31:05,935 --> 00:31:09,610
Who was the tiny tank?
Who's a pretty, little, cheeky chorizo?

484
00:31:10,855 --> 00:31:14,165
On bended knees,
please come and play with me.

485
00:31:14,295 --> 00:31:16,411
Johnnie dear,
you know how much I love you,

486
00:31:16,535 --> 00:31:20,084
so please try to take this
in the best possible light.

487
00:31:20,215 --> 00:31:24,128
I'm getting a machine gun
and mowing down your entire family.

488
00:31:24,255 --> 00:31:27,725
That's fairly disappointing. I thought
you and Father were getting along.

489
00:31:27,855 --> 00:31:30,369
Yes, I might spare the men folk.

490
00:31:30,495 --> 00:31:34,044
But it's awfully dispiriting.
We have absolutely no privacy here.

491
00:31:34,175 --> 00:31:36,564
I never needed any privacy before.
This is my home.

492
00:31:36,695 --> 00:31:39,289
It's not mine.
And I very much want one.

493
00:31:40,655 --> 00:31:45,524
# We're all alone,
no chaperone can get our number

494
00:31:45,655 --> 00:31:49,614
# The world's aslumber,
let's misbehave

495
00:31:49,735 --> 00:31:50,963
(Dog yaps)

496
00:31:52,695 --> 00:31:55,289
Timing is everything, you little brute!

497
00:31:55,415 --> 00:31:58,566
Umpire at least.
Philip is pining for you.

498
00:31:58,695 --> 00:32:02,449
If I knew you played tennis, I never
would've signed the marriage certificate!

499
00:32:02,575 --> 00:32:04,247
(John) Ow!

500
00:32:06,375 --> 00:32:08,047
(Sighs heavily)

501
00:32:08,175 --> 00:32:09,574
(Cracking)

502
00:32:10,335 --> 00:32:12,166
(Gasps)

503
00:32:14,335 --> 00:32:15,927
(Door opens)

504
00:32:17,015 --> 00:32:19,449
(Marion) Not a bad day for it.

505
00:32:19,575 --> 00:32:21,293
Reading.

506
00:32:21,415 --> 00:32:24,168
My fiancé, Edgar,
was always hiding behind books.

507
00:32:24,295 --> 00:32:28,607
Erm... you're needed on the tennis court.
John was just asking after you.

508
00:32:28,735 --> 00:32:31,807
Would you like to see
a photo of him... my Edgar?

509
00:32:31,935 --> 00:32:33,129
Poppy!

510
00:32:36,255 --> 00:32:39,292
That's Enrico Caruso.
- Who's dead, I know that...

511
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:42,725
But if you ignore
the nose and the mouth...

512
00:32:42,855 --> 00:32:46,131
...and the ears...
there's a striking resemblance.

513
00:32:47,975 --> 00:32:50,011
I don't actually have a picture of Edgar.

514
00:32:51,375 --> 00:32:53,331
Well... mustn't keep you.

515
00:32:53,455 --> 00:32:57,334
No, no. Of course. Looking forward
to getting stuck in to a good book.

516
00:32:57,455 --> 00:32:59,411
(Mrs Whittaker) Poppy!

517
00:32:59,535 --> 00:33:02,129
You haven't seen the beast, have you?
- The dog?

518
00:33:02,255 --> 00:33:04,485
Nope. I haven't.

519
00:33:06,135 --> 00:33:07,534
(Mrs Whittaker) Poppy!

520
00:33:13,215 --> 00:33:16,571
Oh, poor, poor Poppy. I'm so sorry.

521
00:33:16,695 --> 00:33:18,333
(Hilda) Larita!

522
00:33:20,575 --> 00:33:24,932
I've been sent in to badger you.
Please help us make up doubles?

523
00:33:25,055 --> 00:33:29,526
Oh, Hilda, I can't. I'm only good
for the cocktails between sets.

524
00:33:29,655 --> 00:33:33,807
We're between sets now.
- You can't possibly want me on court.

525
00:33:35,055 --> 00:33:37,569
Philip! Go get him.

526
00:33:40,255 --> 00:33:42,132
(Mrs Whittaker) Poppy!

527
00:33:42,255 --> 00:33:43,927
(Door closes)

528
00:33:44,055 --> 00:33:45,568
(Mrs Whittaker) Poppy!

529
00:33:45,695 --> 00:33:47,174
Poppy!

530
00:33:50,575 --> 00:33:52,327
What are you doing?
- (Marion) Reading.

531
00:33:52,455 --> 00:33:55,367
"Sodom and Gomorrah:
A Biblical Story".

532
00:33:55,495 --> 00:33:57,929
(Mrs Whittaker) Who gave you this filth?

533
00:34:01,375 --> 00:34:04,447
Go and find the dog! Larita!

534
00:34:06,815 --> 00:34:10,603
Please refrain from giving my daughter
pornographic literature.

535
00:34:10,735 --> 00:34:12,168
Yes, yes, of course.

536
00:34:12,295 --> 00:34:14,855
Oh, and I've volunteered you and Hilda

537
00:34:14,975 --> 00:34:18,524
to perform the Dance of the Dying Swan
for the War Widows' Revue.

538
00:34:18,655 --> 00:34:20,407
We're short on numbers.

539
00:34:20,535 --> 00:34:22,890
Lovely. Anything to help.

540
00:34:23,015 --> 00:34:24,607
Have you seen the dog?

541
00:34:24,735 --> 00:34:26,805
No. Not recently.

542
00:34:26,935 --> 00:34:30,644
Probably out seizing the sunshine
like everyone else.

543
00:34:34,375 --> 00:34:36,172
Poppy!

544
00:34:38,615 --> 00:34:40,014
Furber!

545
00:34:44,095 --> 00:34:47,485
Oh, it's you, Madam. I'm sorry.
Can I get you anything?

546
00:34:47,615 --> 00:34:51,210
A shovel.
- Shovel. Of course.

547
00:34:51,895 --> 00:34:54,329
Go and get Philip a hot toddy.

548
00:34:54,455 --> 00:35:00,451
Philip. You look so... so... so...
- (Philip) The suspense is killing me.

549
00:35:00,575 --> 00:35:02,088
(Mrs Whittaker) Poppy!

550
00:35:02,775 --> 00:35:05,243
Oh... sorry.
- It's fine.

551
00:35:13,455 --> 00:35:15,969
Your brother is such
a sharply honed twit.

552
00:35:16,095 --> 00:35:18,404
(Giggles)

553
00:35:18,535 --> 00:35:22,972
Where's our beautiful cougar hiding?
- Under a book, I expect.

554
00:35:23,095 --> 00:35:25,689
I wish she wouldn't slack indoors
so much.

555
00:35:25,815 --> 00:35:29,330
Some people would kill
to be indoors with Larita.

556
00:35:29,455 --> 00:35:31,446
She isn't built the same as us.

557
00:35:31,575 --> 00:35:33,452
Still, it is annoying, though.

558
00:35:33,575 --> 00:35:36,294
You're such a sport,
always ready for anything.

559
00:35:36,415 --> 00:35:42,126
I haven't got Lari's beauty
or charm or intelligence.

560
00:35:42,255 --> 00:35:44,849
She is clever, isn't she?
- Hmm...

561
00:35:44,975 --> 00:35:48,285
Clever... and bored.

562
00:35:48,415 --> 00:35:52,966
I don't understand it. I'm not bored,
you're not bored, nobody else is bored.

563
00:35:53,095 --> 00:35:55,609
Your father is, out of his mind.

564
00:35:55,735 --> 00:35:57,566
Father was born bored.

565
00:35:58,495 --> 00:36:00,850
If only she made an effort to play along.

566
00:36:00,975 --> 00:36:03,443
Stop being so torturous, Panda.

567
00:36:03,575 --> 00:36:06,009
You had her playing charades last night.
What more do you want?

568
00:36:06,135 --> 00:36:09,047
(Mrs Whittaker) John! John?

569
00:36:13,895 --> 00:36:18,127
To tell the truth, I never really liked her.
Crabby, snappy, little bitch...

570
00:36:19,095 --> 00:36:22,087
I didn't like the dog much, either.
- (Jackson chuckles)

571
00:36:24,095 --> 00:36:27,371
Poor Poppy. Casualty of war.

572
00:36:30,375 --> 00:36:32,730
If I may be so bold, Madam?

573
00:36:32,855 --> 00:36:36,894
These people ride horses.
Lots of horses.

574
00:36:37,015 --> 00:36:39,813
It would be advantageous
to do the same.

575
00:36:41,895 --> 00:36:44,773
And I thought Detroit was a tough town.

576
00:36:47,575 --> 00:36:54,367
# You do something to me

577
00:36:55,415 --> 00:37:02,048
# Something that simply
mystifies me... #

578
00:37:05,575 --> 00:37:07,964
Oh, has your horse run out of gas?

579
00:37:09,215 --> 00:37:10,853
(Barking)

580
00:37:16,855 --> 00:37:18,925
Oh, John, don't hurt it.

581
00:37:19,055 --> 00:37:23,890
Far from it. We've got a hunt coming up.
Poor little mite needs a head start.

582
00:37:25,495 --> 00:37:27,372
Go on... run!

583
00:37:30,295 --> 00:37:33,731
So much to learn about each other.

584
00:37:35,415 --> 00:37:40,045
My curriculum vitae. The brook
is the border of Sarah's property.

585
00:37:40,175 --> 00:37:44,293
Mother always imagined
we'd join forces and invade Surrey.

586
00:37:44,415 --> 00:37:46,292
(Distant voices)

587
00:37:46,415 --> 00:37:49,885
Oh, and how about
those foot soldiers on high?

588
00:37:50,015 --> 00:37:54,167
(John) That's Davis, Lord Hurst's man.
And there's Lord Hurst...

589
00:37:54,295 --> 00:37:56,445
Closely followed by my mother-in-law.

590
00:37:56,575 --> 00:37:59,248
I wonder what the devil
they're surveying?

591
00:38:02,015 --> 00:38:05,212
Are you disappointed
you didn't marry Sarah?

592
00:38:05,335 --> 00:38:08,964
Of course not. We've seen each other
naked since we were one.

593
00:38:09,095 --> 00:38:12,212
She's part of the... the... the...
scenery.

594
00:38:13,455 --> 00:38:15,889
You can hack it a little while longer,
can't you?

595
00:38:16,015 --> 00:38:20,054
How long is a little?
And don't say two weeks again.

596
00:38:20,175 --> 00:38:23,611
Well, there's the War Widows' Revue,
the craft fair...

597
00:38:23,735 --> 00:38:25,293
...the hunt.

598
00:38:25,415 --> 00:38:29,044
The memorial service...
- What memorial service?

599
00:38:30,855 --> 00:38:34,131
Friends, we are gathered here today

600
00:38:34,255 --> 00:38:38,089
in remembrance
of our missing friend, Poppy.

601
00:38:38,215 --> 00:38:39,933
Oh, Poppy...

602
00:38:40,895 --> 00:38:44,331
Wherever you have chosen
to sow your seeds,

603
00:38:44,455 --> 00:38:47,015
we pray that you are blooming.

604
00:38:47,135 --> 00:38:49,695
We pray that you have gone
to a better place.

605
00:38:49,815 --> 00:38:53,171
Shame we don't know
exactly where that place is...

606
00:38:53,295 --> 00:38:56,685
Anyway, now for a eulogy
from Emily Dickinson, queen of mirth.

607
00:38:56,815 --> 00:38:58,692
(Barking)

608
00:38:58,815 --> 00:39:03,445
"Because I could not stop for death,
he kindly stopped for me.

609
00:39:03,575 --> 00:39:07,329
"The carriage held but just ourselves
and immortality."

610
00:39:07,455 --> 00:39:12,051
Or maybe the carriage didn't stop
and Poppy got squished.

611
00:39:12,175 --> 00:39:14,530
Scraped off the road
and put in a sausage...

612
00:39:14,655 --> 00:39:17,374
(Hilda giggles)
- (Mrs Whittaker) Oh, Hilda!

613
00:39:17,495 --> 00:39:18,928
(Cheering)

614
00:39:19,055 --> 00:39:21,046
(Laughing and clapping)

615
00:39:25,255 --> 00:39:27,450
(Woman) Thank you, Mr Gribble.

616
00:39:28,175 --> 00:39:31,611
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls,

617
00:39:31,735 --> 00:39:36,047
behold Reverend Burton
and Marion Whittaker

618
00:39:36,175 --> 00:39:41,124
as they reach for the scissors
in "Samson and Delilah".

619
00:39:41,255 --> 00:39:43,450
(Applause)

620
00:39:49,415 --> 00:39:50,814
(Snoring)

621
00:39:52,295 --> 00:39:55,332
Hark! I hear my husband snore!

622
00:39:56,535 --> 00:40:00,733
What the hell happened to Delilah?
Looks like a sock full of oranges.

623
00:40:00,855 --> 00:40:06,885
I'll creep forth on padded foot
and relieve him of his ample follicles.

624
00:40:07,015 --> 00:40:08,414
(Snoring)

625
00:40:10,775 --> 00:40:12,766
(Laughing and clapping)

626
00:40:29,615 --> 00:40:32,812
(Hilda) How hilarious!
- It's meant to be a tragedy!

627
00:40:32,935 --> 00:40:35,244
Then you succeeded
beyond your wildest dreams.

628
00:40:35,375 --> 00:40:38,173
(Larita) Your father seems
to have a fan.

629
00:40:38,295 --> 00:40:41,526
Don't read too much into it. She was
a godsend during mother's last months.

630
00:40:41,655 --> 00:40:44,294
Sometimes I wonder where they'd be
without each other.

631
00:40:44,415 --> 00:40:46,804
My ample follicles are in dire need
of a trim.

632
00:40:49,095 --> 00:40:52,690
I wouldn't taunt the artistes,
my little dying swans. You're on next.

633
00:40:52,815 --> 00:40:56,490
I've encouraged my girls to undertake
something a little more contemporary.

634
00:40:56,615 --> 00:40:59,288
Hilda and I seem to have a talent
for the can-can.

635
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:02,293
The traditional can-can,
performed without underwear?

636
00:41:02,415 --> 00:41:05,725
Oh, Philip!
- Anything for you, Philip.

637
00:41:05,855 --> 00:41:07,493
Yes, anything.

638
00:41:07,615 --> 00:41:10,368
That'll raise a bit more than money
for the war widows.

639
00:41:10,495 --> 00:41:13,805
I'm doubling my donation.
- Oh, Pinkie.

640
00:41:13,935 --> 00:41:16,130
Fans at the ready, gentlemen!

641
00:41:16,255 --> 00:41:19,247
All the way from gay Paris,

642
00:41:19,375 --> 00:41:22,173
I give you Miss Hilda Whittaker

643
00:41:22,295 --> 00:41:27,210
and, for her debut performance,
Mrs John Whittaker

644
00:41:27,335 --> 00:41:30,372
doing 'The Can-Can'!

645
00:41:30,495 --> 00:41:32,372
(Crowd) Ooh!

646
00:41:32,495 --> 00:41:34,565
(# Gramophone plays French Can-can)

647
00:41:36,695 --> 00:41:38,731
(Crowd) Ooh!

648
00:41:38,855 --> 00:41:40,368
(Laughing and clapping)

649
00:41:51,415 --> 00:41:53,724
(Man) Did... did you?
- (Crowd gasps)

650
00:41:56,255 --> 00:42:01,045
Is it my imagination, or is your daughter
dancing without her scanties?

651
00:42:14,175 --> 00:42:16,928
(Crowd gasps)

652
00:42:17,055 --> 00:42:18,090
(Chuckling)

653
00:42:23,535 --> 00:42:24,854
(Thump)
- Ow!

654
00:42:36,855 --> 00:42:38,573
Bravo!

655
00:42:50,655 --> 00:42:52,486
(Gasps)

656
00:42:56,255 --> 00:42:59,884
(John) It's not Lari's fault.
(Hilda) She said it was traditional!

657
00:43:00,015 --> 00:43:02,245
Philip said it, not Larita.
And it was a joke.

658
00:43:02,375 --> 00:43:04,570
Everyone understood that
except Nelly No Knickers here!

659
00:43:04,695 --> 00:43:08,324
Hilda isn't as experienced
as your wife, John. No one is.

660
00:43:08,455 --> 00:43:11,527
If you're not prepared to have a straight
talk to her, then I certainly am.

661
00:43:11,655 --> 00:43:13,611
Don't be ridiculous.
You'll lose a finger.

662
00:43:13,735 --> 00:43:17,808
Lord Hurst will never speak to me.
- Rubbish. I saw you in the back fields.

663
00:43:17,935 --> 00:43:20,574
Preparing the jumps for the hunt!

664
00:43:20,695 --> 00:43:24,290
I'm completely humiliated!
I'll never get a husband now!

665
00:43:24,415 --> 00:43:26,724
After tonight, I'd have thought
they'll be lining up round the block.

666
00:43:26,855 --> 00:43:29,892
(Hilda) I hate her! Hate, hate, hate her!

667
00:43:31,575 --> 00:43:34,806
The advance notices
are sensational, Mrs John.

668
00:43:34,935 --> 00:43:37,529
(Cutlery tinkling on crockery)

669
00:43:44,815 --> 00:43:49,411
Is it my imagination or is the cutlery
particularly deafening this evening?

670
00:43:49,535 --> 00:43:53,244
I don't know how many times
I have to say this, Hilda. I am sorry.

671
00:43:53,375 --> 00:43:57,687
That's easy for you to say.
- It's surprisingly hard to be easy.

672
00:43:59,055 --> 00:44:02,764
You're smiling, Jim.
- God forbid, the wind might change.

673
00:44:05,375 --> 00:44:08,811
Hilda, if I had any inkling that you
were going to take me seriously...

674
00:44:08,935 --> 00:44:11,085
You could have made an effort
to enjoy it less.

675
00:44:11,215 --> 00:44:14,651
I had my underpants on.
I was having a grand time.

676
00:44:15,895 --> 00:44:20,889
It's not fair! You've got two husbands,
and I've had none.

677
00:44:21,015 --> 00:44:23,813
Technically, I have one.
- But you've had two.

678
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:26,290
I've had two shoes
and it's a great deal more practical.

679
00:44:26,415 --> 00:44:29,805
I dare say you've worn down
more soles than that.

680
00:44:32,695 --> 00:44:34,606
John...

681
00:44:34,735 --> 00:44:38,171
Marion, Larita's first husband died
of cancer. Stop being so callous.

682
00:44:38,295 --> 00:44:40,855
Oh, I'm sure Marion
can appreciate the pain

683
00:44:40,975 --> 00:44:43,648
of watching a loved one
slip through her fingers.

684
00:44:43,775 --> 00:44:45,686
She's scandalous!

685
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:49,728
You should hear what they're saying
about her in the village.

686
00:44:49,855 --> 00:44:52,005
Well, let's stop the wagging tongues,
shall we?

687
00:44:52,135 --> 00:44:55,445
Is it true you've had
as many lovers as they say?

688
00:44:57,815 --> 00:45:00,887
Of course it's not true, Mrs Whittaker.

689
00:45:01,015 --> 00:45:03,848
Hardly any of them actually loved me.

690
00:45:06,415 --> 00:45:09,487
That was uncalled for.
I realise it was a joke, but still...

691
00:45:09,615 --> 00:45:13,608
You threw me to the wolves in there.
- Marion hardly constitutes wolves.

692
00:45:13,735 --> 00:45:17,614
All right, you threw me to the voles.
Either way, you abandoned me.

693
00:45:17,735 --> 00:45:19,930
Your sisters need to be restrained.

694
00:45:20,055 --> 00:45:24,253
Restrained? Hilda breaks loose once
and she's almost institutionalised.

695
00:45:24,375 --> 00:45:27,048
And poor old Marion...
Edgar drops by for a cup of sugar,

696
00:45:27,175 --> 00:45:29,484
and mother has his name
engraved on the family crypt.

697
00:45:29,615 --> 00:45:32,175
I'm sorry but it really is very funny.
- Hilarious!

698
00:45:32,295 --> 00:45:34,445
Welcome to the petrified circus.

699
00:45:34,575 --> 00:45:37,851
Meet the resident contortionist
who can't bend any further.

700
00:45:37,975 --> 00:45:41,934
Then stop. Be yourself.
Let them live in your spell.

701
00:45:42,055 --> 00:45:46,810
# You do that voodoo
that you do so well... #

702
00:45:46,935 --> 00:45:51,087
You're right, of course. I'm a hypocrite,
pretending to be someone I'm not.

703
00:45:51,215 --> 00:45:53,934
Especially since it isn't working.

704
00:45:54,855 --> 00:45:58,245
What the devil has that dog dug up?

705
00:46:01,135 --> 00:46:03,126
(Marion) Pilot, what have you got there?

706
00:46:03,255 --> 00:46:04,688
(Screams)

707
00:46:04,815 --> 00:46:07,090
How could you not tell us?

708
00:46:07,215 --> 00:46:10,525
Marion, it was an accident.
I am walking on eggshells here.

709
00:46:10,655 --> 00:46:15,092
And I believe I panicked.
And once again, I'm very, very sorry.

710
00:46:15,215 --> 00:46:18,412
(Marion sobs)
- How could you do it? How could you?

711
00:46:18,535 --> 00:46:23,165
I imagine she lowered her full weight
onto the Chihuahua beneath her.

712
00:46:23,295 --> 00:46:24,853
(Sobbing)

713
00:46:24,975 --> 00:46:26,966
Marion, please.

714
00:46:27,095 --> 00:46:30,132
John, did you have anything
to do with this?

715
00:46:30,255 --> 00:46:34,009
No. No, I was the sole perpetrator
of Poppy's demise.

716
00:46:34,135 --> 00:46:36,968
And ever since
I have been wracked with guilt.

717
00:46:37,455 --> 00:46:41,289
Please, please, please
let me buy you a new dog.

718
00:46:42,455 --> 00:46:45,367
You might buy your loved ones
in the United States,

719
00:46:45,495 --> 00:46:47,690
but you can't in the United Kingdom.

720
00:46:47,815 --> 00:46:49,089
How unfortunate.

721
00:46:49,215 --> 00:46:52,844
You could at least show some remorse.

722
00:46:52,975 --> 00:46:57,287
I am full of remorse. I just refuse
to invest in amateur theatrics

723
00:46:57,415 --> 00:46:58,973
to convince you of my sincerity.

724
00:46:59,095 --> 00:47:02,167
That's not how I came off
the assembly line. I'm sorry.

725
00:47:02,295 --> 00:47:03,933
I can't change.

726
00:47:04,055 --> 00:47:08,207
Not for you...
not for anybody... any more.

727
00:47:11,095 --> 00:47:14,610
And I wouldn't want her
any other way. So...

728
00:47:17,775 --> 00:47:22,405
Madam, the dog.
- Oh, stay back! Stay back!

729
00:47:23,735 --> 00:47:28,411
(Marion) I knew it the second
I laid eyes on her. She's a killer.

730
00:47:28,535 --> 00:47:30,605
She sat on poor Poppy deliberately.

731
00:47:30,735 --> 00:47:33,329
Don't be ridiculous.
Of course she didn't.

732
00:47:33,455 --> 00:47:37,687
My brother has married a dog murderer.
She should be put down.

733
00:47:37,815 --> 00:47:39,646
(Mrs Whittaker)
Put through a divorce court.

734
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:41,572
(Marion) The Lord does not
sanction divorce.

735
00:47:41,695 --> 00:47:44,926
The Lord is Almighty, Marion.
He can sanction anything he likes.

736
00:47:45,055 --> 00:47:46,886
(Marion) The sooner they move out
the better.

737
00:47:47,015 --> 00:47:50,564
They move out?
John isn't going anywhere.

738
00:47:50,695 --> 00:47:52,447
Watch and learn.

739
00:47:54,255 --> 00:47:56,291
(Voices upstairs)

740
00:47:57,735 --> 00:48:00,886
(Hilda) It's so unfair.
Why can't I have a room like this?

741
00:48:02,215 --> 00:48:03,853
(Giggling)

742
00:48:03,975 --> 00:48:07,172
(Hilda) I could die of envy!

743
00:48:07,295 --> 00:48:09,650
Laying to rest this tragic incident,

744
00:48:09,775 --> 00:48:13,529
we've had this splendid set of rooms
made over for you, haven't we, Jim?

745
00:48:13,655 --> 00:48:16,727
Yes. My wife would like you
to rest in peace.

746
00:48:16,855 --> 00:48:20,734
I even had an old friend of Johnnie's
brought down from the attic.

747
00:48:20,855 --> 00:48:23,369
"Old Faithful Awaits
His Master's Return".

748
00:48:23,495 --> 00:48:26,293
I used to sleep under
that silly painting.

749
00:48:26,415 --> 00:48:29,134
Very comforting, I'm sure,
but we're expected back in Mayfair.

750
00:48:29,255 --> 00:48:32,008
But these are the largest rooms
in the house.

751
00:48:32,135 --> 00:48:34,126
You'll find nothing like it in London.

752
00:48:34,255 --> 00:48:36,246
She has a point.
- (Jim) She always does.

753
00:48:36,375 --> 00:48:39,412
Sometimes I don't know
why you ever did wander home.

754
00:48:39,535 --> 00:48:41,014
And miss all the fun?

755
00:48:41,615 --> 00:48:44,175
Cook would like to inform you,
Mrs Whittaker, the bird is stuffed.

756
00:48:44,295 --> 00:48:46,013
Oh!

757
00:48:46,135 --> 00:48:48,126
What bird, hmm?

758
00:48:48,255 --> 00:48:51,053
Thursday is bubble and squeak.
I hadn't made any arrangements.

759
00:48:51,175 --> 00:48:53,131
Oh, but I have!

760
00:48:58,375 --> 00:49:02,334
In appreciation of your understanding
and for that delicious double bed.

761
00:49:02,455 --> 00:49:05,208
We'll think of you every time we use it.

762
00:49:12,135 --> 00:49:15,207
What exactly are we celebrating?
- Thanksgiving.

763
00:49:15,335 --> 00:49:17,291
Thanks for what, hmm?

764
00:49:17,415 --> 00:49:20,851
The annihilation
of an entire indigenous people.

765
00:49:20,975 --> 00:49:23,773
A loving union of two great cultures.

766
00:49:23,895 --> 00:49:26,773
Just like us.
- How transcontinental.

767
00:49:26,895 --> 00:49:29,853
I can't believe you got into the kitchen.
- Beatrice did put up a fight.

768
00:49:29,975 --> 00:49:33,092
But technically I outrank her.
- Who's Beatrice?

769
00:49:33,215 --> 00:49:38,414
Your cook. Or now my undercook,
since I'm qualified cordon bleu.

770
00:49:38,535 --> 00:49:40,605
That's a degree.

771
00:49:40,735 --> 00:49:45,126
Furber... take the vegetables down to
the kitchen and tell Cook to cook them.

772
00:49:45,255 --> 00:49:49,567
No, Furber, thank you.
I think I'll surprise my alimentary canal.

773
00:49:50,695 --> 00:49:54,051
Mother, if you don't mind, I'm going
to eat my meal before it gets cold.

774
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:56,131
Furber, I've changed my mind,
bring it back!

775
00:49:56,255 --> 00:49:57,324
Me, too.

776
00:49:59,215 --> 00:50:01,206
Gobble, gobble!

777
00:50:06,255 --> 00:50:07,654
Yes!

778
00:50:11,455 --> 00:50:13,013
(Larita) Here's a tip, Hilda.

779
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:16,445
A sure way to a man's heart is
through his stomach. Or his mother.

780
00:50:16,575 --> 00:50:20,773
Larita, look, I've found
another likeness of Edgar.

781
00:50:20,895 --> 00:50:24,410
Marion, this is Fatty Arbuckle.
- Who's in jail, I know that.

782
00:50:24,535 --> 00:50:27,732
But if you cut out his cheeks
and give him a bald patch,

783
00:50:27,855 --> 00:50:30,244
there's a striking resemblance...

784
00:50:30,375 --> 00:50:33,173
Edgar's away on a trip
across the pond,

785
00:50:33,295 --> 00:50:36,128
sewing his wild oats,
or something agricultural.

786
00:50:37,655 --> 00:50:41,443
She's good, I'll give her that.
- I think you're over-reacting.

787
00:50:41,575 --> 00:50:42,974
(Sneezes)

788
00:50:47,895 --> 00:50:50,363
Lari? Lari!

789
00:50:51,335 --> 00:50:53,895
Not the vase! Not the vase!

790
00:50:54,015 --> 00:50:57,291
"Taking the corncockle buds
and bee-kissed roses

791
00:50:57,415 --> 00:50:59,406
"roughly in his calloused hands,

792
00:50:59,535 --> 00:51:04,814
"his hot, moist tulip exploded
in her river of delights..."

793
00:51:06,695 --> 00:51:08,208
(Car engine)

794
00:51:15,495 --> 00:51:17,372
(John) Larita?

795
00:51:17,495 --> 00:51:19,531
Early Christmas present...

796
00:51:19,655 --> 00:51:22,772
For you, darling.
- Ooh, the mind boggles.

797
00:51:30,295 --> 00:51:31,694
(John) Well, it's... it's...

798
00:51:31,815 --> 00:51:33,726
(Jim) It's magnificent.
(Mrs Whittaker) It's monstrous!

799
00:51:33,855 --> 00:51:38,212
It's me. I posed for a young Spaniard.
Don't you absolutely adore it?

800
00:51:38,335 --> 00:51:41,327
Very expressive, darling,
but I can't quite see you in it.

801
00:51:41,455 --> 00:51:42,934
(Mrs Whittaker) You can see
everything else!

802
00:51:43,055 --> 00:51:45,694
You took your clothes off
in front of a total stranger?

803
00:51:45,815 --> 00:51:49,524
Of course she took her clothes off.
- (Marion) I think it's unholy.

804
00:51:49,655 --> 00:51:54,934
I'm not sure I approve of you being nude.
You know, without... without me.

805
00:51:55,055 --> 00:51:56,454
Extraordinary.

806
00:51:57,575 --> 00:52:00,328
What exactly are you
hoping to achieve?

807
00:52:00,455 --> 00:52:03,128
Just trying to get into the swing
of things... Mother.

808
00:52:03,255 --> 00:52:08,852
Marvellous! Well, then, you'll be riding
in the hunt with us, won't you?

809
00:52:08,975 --> 00:52:11,887
I might be persuaded
if the painting stays.

810
00:52:12,015 --> 00:52:13,687
Hunt.
- Paint.

811
00:52:13,815 --> 00:52:15,487
Hunt.
- Paint.

812
00:52:15,615 --> 00:52:17,048
Hunt!

813
00:52:17,175 --> 00:52:18,767
Very well.

814
00:52:20,655 --> 00:52:22,088
Hunt.

815
00:52:27,655 --> 00:52:29,407
View, hello.

816
00:52:32,535 --> 00:52:36,084
Hello, everyone.
Good to see you. Richard.

817
00:52:36,215 --> 00:52:39,491
Morning, Jim!
After generations of false starts,

818
00:52:39,615 --> 00:52:42,129
we've finally managed
to combine our cavalry.

819
00:52:42,255 --> 00:52:44,849
Congratulations.
A marriage of minor convenience.

820
00:52:44,975 --> 00:52:46,727
You'll be fine, I promise.

821
00:52:46,855 --> 00:52:51,326
The second you have the Holborough
boy's eye, flirt outrageously.

822
00:52:51,455 --> 00:52:54,049
But Warwick Holborough has ears
like the Cambridge Cup!

823
00:52:54,175 --> 00:52:59,169
And Philip's the prize. Now, if you want
a man's attention... ignore him.

824
00:53:06,095 --> 00:53:09,212
(Philip) Warwick the Wingnut
and Sausage Fingers?

825
00:53:09,335 --> 00:53:13,408
What a handsome couple.
They'll have puppies not children.

826
00:53:15,295 --> 00:53:19,004
Wait... there's something I need to say.

827
00:53:20,095 --> 00:53:23,326
I see you... you're wasted here.

828
00:53:23,455 --> 00:53:27,130
When the time comes... give me a ring.

829
00:53:27,255 --> 00:53:30,088
If I could find your neck, I'd wring it.

830
00:53:30,215 --> 00:53:33,969
Larita's making sheep's eyes at Philip.
- She's a Venus de Flytrap!

831
00:53:34,095 --> 00:53:38,054
(Hilda) She wants him all to herself.
- She's not interested in Philip.

832
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:40,450
Nobody's interested in Philip.
- (Hilda) I am!

833
00:53:41,375 --> 00:53:43,047
Mount up, Larita.

834
00:53:43,175 --> 00:53:46,929
If you don't mind, I think
I might give the fox a head start.

835
00:53:47,055 --> 00:53:49,853
Lari, get on the pony, please.

836
00:53:50,415 --> 00:53:52,485
Oh, it's just as I thought...

837
00:53:52,615 --> 00:53:55,925
Oh, I said I'd ride,
and I'm always good for my word.

838
00:53:56,895 --> 00:53:58,089
Tally-ho!

839
00:54:06,255 --> 00:54:08,371
(Cheering)

840
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:10,884
(# 1920s version of "Sex Bomb")

841
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:17,163
# Spy on me, baby, use satellite

842
00:54:17,295 --> 00:54:21,174
# Infrared to see me
move through the night

843
00:54:21,295 --> 00:54:24,651
# Aim, going to fire, shoot me right

844
00:54:24,775 --> 00:54:28,529
# I'm going to like the way you fight

845
00:54:28,655 --> 00:54:32,568
# Now you've found
the secret code I use

846
00:54:32,695 --> 00:54:36,370
# To wash away my lonely blues

847
00:54:36,495 --> 00:54:42,604
# So I can't deny or lie
cos you're the only one to make me fly

848
00:54:43,735 --> 00:54:47,853
# Sex bomb, sex bomb,
you're a sex bomb

849
00:54:47,975 --> 00:54:51,126
# You can give it to me
when I need to come along...

850
00:54:51,255 --> 00:54:53,564
(Engine revs)
- What?

851
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:55,890
# You're my sex bomb... #

852
00:54:56,015 --> 00:54:59,212
What is she doing?
- A victory lap, by the look of things.

853
00:55:00,215 --> 00:55:03,605
There's something wild about that child
that's so contagious.

854
00:55:06,895 --> 00:55:08,965
Whoo-hoo!

855
00:55:12,055 --> 00:55:15,934
Well, she promised she'd ride.
Ha-ha!

856
00:55:24,815 --> 00:55:28,285
#... no chaperone
can get our number

857
00:55:28,415 --> 00:55:33,250
# The world's in a slumber,
let's misbehave!

858
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:37,971
# There's something wild
about you, child, that's so contagious

859
00:55:38,095 --> 00:55:43,010
# Let's be outrageous,
let's misbehave!

860
00:55:43,135 --> 00:55:47,686
# When Adam won Eve's hand,
he wouldn't stand for teasin'

861
00:55:47,815 --> 00:55:52,445
# He didn't care about those apples
out of season

862
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:57,285
# They say that Spring means
just one little thing to little lovebirds

863
00:55:57,415 --> 00:56:02,773
# We're not above birds,
let's misbehave... #

864
00:56:08,815 --> 00:56:10,328
(Larita) Whoo!

865
00:56:20,375 --> 00:56:22,935
Miss Hilda,
telephone from New York.

866
00:56:30,215 --> 00:56:31,648
Uncle George?

867
00:56:31,775 --> 00:56:34,528
Oh, thank God, a friendly voice.

868
00:56:34,655 --> 00:56:37,647
Yes, and she's a complete nightmare.

869
00:56:40,295 --> 00:56:42,206
Really?

870
00:56:42,335 --> 00:56:44,451
How salacious.

871
00:56:45,975 --> 00:56:46,612
(Knocking)

872
00:56:46,735 --> 00:56:48,532
(Mrs Whittaker) Come in.

873
00:56:49,415 --> 00:56:50,814
Mother?

874
00:56:52,135 --> 00:56:55,252
I'd like to apologise
for today's schmozzle.

875
00:56:55,375 --> 00:56:57,570
That really won't be necessary.

876
00:56:57,695 --> 00:57:00,732
Larita made no secret
of her disapproval of blood sports.

877
00:57:00,855 --> 00:57:02,368
She did ride as promised.

878
00:57:02,495 --> 00:57:07,728
Well, we should credit her with her
imaginative way of keeping her word.

879
00:57:07,855 --> 00:57:09,846
You must be very proud of her.

880
00:57:10,855 --> 00:57:13,323
Mother, I think...

881
00:57:13,455 --> 00:57:15,844
I think maybe Larita and I ought to go.

882
00:57:15,975 --> 00:57:18,091
Oh...

883
00:57:18,215 --> 00:57:20,729
Yes, I see. Very well.

884
00:57:20,855 --> 00:57:24,530
Feel free to drop in
whenever it takes your fancy.

885
00:57:24,655 --> 00:57:26,771
Off you go. Enjoy.
- Don't be like that.

886
00:57:26,895 --> 00:57:29,773
I'm sorry, dear,
wasn't Mummy being kind enough?

887
00:57:29,895 --> 00:57:32,284
Take these, they might get you
as far as Constantinople!

888
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:34,975
And this... Casablanca.
- Mother, stop it!

889
00:57:35,095 --> 00:57:36,892
No. You stop it!

890
00:57:38,215 --> 00:57:40,206
Stop being so naïve!

891
00:57:46,815 --> 00:57:49,204
The money's gone, John.

892
00:57:49,335 --> 00:57:51,212
Nothing left.

893
00:57:51,335 --> 00:57:54,407
The only thing standing
between this family and bankruptcy

894
00:57:54,535 --> 00:57:56,924
are those surveyors in the back field.

895
00:57:58,615 --> 00:58:04,008
Lord Hurst is offering to buy 400 acres
to keep the bailiffs away.

896
00:58:05,535 --> 00:58:09,813
It's your legacy, John Whittaker...
and I'm selling it.

897
00:58:14,215 --> 00:58:18,686
I had no idea.
- No... No, you don't.

898
00:58:23,375 --> 00:58:27,414
You were supposed to take over
the estate, take your responsibilities.

899
00:58:27,535 --> 00:58:30,413
But you were unexpectedly
flagged down.

900
00:58:32,055 --> 00:58:35,013
I've been struggling for years
with a man who doesn't care,

901
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:37,251
waiting for you to step up to the mark.

902
00:58:39,655 --> 00:58:42,647
No. You just go.

903
00:58:42,775 --> 00:58:46,006
Go to Algiers
with your racing car driver.

904
00:58:46,135 --> 00:58:48,695
I'm too tired to care any more!

905
00:58:50,775 --> 00:58:54,324
(Larita) It's not exactly surprising,
John. Look at the grounds.

906
00:58:54,455 --> 00:58:58,733
Your mother is being very practical.
- In what sense?

907
00:58:58,855 --> 00:59:02,086
You're not coming back.
Your father moved out decades ago.

908
00:59:02,215 --> 00:59:06,049
Philip's not going to marry Hilda.
Nobody's going to marry Marion.

909
00:59:06,175 --> 00:59:10,054
Subdividing the land and selling
to a neighbour is an elegant solution.

910
00:59:10,175 --> 00:59:11,767
Somewhat harsh.

911
00:59:13,215 --> 00:59:15,809
I've had my fair share
of selling off my past,

912
00:59:15,935 --> 00:59:19,894
and it is an auction of innocence
that's neither fun nor pretty,

913
00:59:20,015 --> 00:59:23,291
but it is realistic,
something your mother excels in.

914
00:59:23,415 --> 00:59:26,009
But it's my responsibility.

915
00:59:27,375 --> 00:59:30,412
Gracious, how can I have been so blind?

916
01:00:07,255 --> 01:00:10,531
(Woman) Oh, winter hydrangeas!
How do you do it?

917
01:00:10,655 --> 01:00:15,251
It's a controlled mixture of passion,
persistence and horse manure.

918
01:00:17,855 --> 01:00:21,131
I was hoping to catch a glimpse
of the new bride.

919
01:00:21,255 --> 01:00:24,611
Ah! John's wife has
very fickle allergies.

920
01:00:24,735 --> 01:00:29,172
Allergies to what?
- Flowers, Emma. Can you believe it?

921
01:00:29,295 --> 01:00:32,332
That is a strange choice of bed fellow
for this neck of the woods.

922
01:00:32,455 --> 01:00:35,652
You'll just have to make do
with John and Sarah.

923
01:00:35,775 --> 01:00:38,164
It'll be like old times.

924
01:00:38,295 --> 01:00:43,608
# When you're smiling,
the whole world smiles... #

925
01:00:45,215 --> 01:00:47,445
Why the big Panda eyes?

926
01:00:49,215 --> 01:00:51,888
I've often meant to ask you something,
but I hadn't the courage.

927
01:00:52,015 --> 01:00:54,006
Well, don't then.

928
01:00:54,135 --> 01:00:58,253
Did you think I behaved like a cad,
marrying Larita without telling you?

929
01:00:58,375 --> 01:01:00,286
No, of course not.

930
01:01:00,415 --> 01:01:03,930
You took the opportunity and married
for love. I respect you for it.

931
01:01:04,055 --> 01:01:07,286
If we'd have married it would've been
for friendship and convenience.

932
01:01:07,415 --> 01:01:09,451
Would it?
- Yes!

933
01:01:09,575 --> 01:01:11,964
We knew one another far too well.

934
01:01:12,095 --> 01:01:17,806
I want my marriage to be thrilling,
romantic, with passionate love letters.

935
01:01:17,935 --> 01:01:21,450
I could've written you love letters.
- Well, you didn't, did you?

936
01:01:21,575 --> 01:01:23,566
I did love you all the same.

937
01:01:24,895 --> 01:01:26,248
John, stop it.

938
01:01:35,015 --> 01:01:37,893
He's very different
from the man I met in France.

939
01:01:39,215 --> 01:01:43,527
The boy. The same, sweet boy.

940
01:01:47,335 --> 01:01:51,692
Is it true what she says?
Are you really selling off the land?

941
01:01:53,215 --> 01:01:56,810
To be perfectly honest,
I haven't the faintest idea.

942
01:01:59,175 --> 01:02:01,848
But it's your home, it's your community.

943
01:02:03,015 --> 01:02:04,812
Doesn't that matter?

944
01:02:04,935 --> 01:02:06,448
No.

945
01:02:08,175 --> 01:02:10,211
You're a dark horse.

946
01:02:12,695 --> 01:02:17,405
Have you noticed how few men
of my age there are in this village?

947
01:02:17,535 --> 01:02:20,527
Fourteen years ago,
we all took the King's shilling.

948
01:02:20,655 --> 01:02:23,328
We all signed up together.

949
01:02:23,455 --> 01:02:28,210
My brother, friends, staff...

950
01:02:29,615 --> 01:02:34,166
All hunkered down in the front row
of The Great War.

951
01:02:35,455 --> 01:02:38,891
I thought they kept majors
safely behind desks?

952
01:02:39,015 --> 01:02:41,210
Promotion for surviving.

953
01:02:42,975 --> 01:02:47,127
As captain, it was my job
to get them all out of the trenches.

954
01:02:47,255 --> 01:02:51,248
Within the first four minutes
of our first charge...

955
01:02:53,295 --> 01:02:55,365
...20,000 men died.

956
01:03:00,535 --> 01:03:02,844
In Thorverton, down the road here...

957
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:06,290
...they were stationed in Morocco.

958
01:03:07,175 --> 01:03:09,564
Their captain bought them all home.

959
01:03:15,255 --> 01:03:18,133
I didn't bring a single man back.

960
01:03:18,935 --> 01:03:20,971
This whole village died.

961
01:03:21,895 --> 01:03:25,171
I think there's a glimmer
of life in you yet.

962
01:03:25,295 --> 01:03:29,925
Well, if there is, it has no time for
pet cemeteries and Japanese lanterns.

963
01:03:30,055 --> 01:03:33,365
Why did you come back?
- I had no choice.

964
01:03:36,735 --> 01:03:40,728
Bonjour, Madame.
Qu'est-ce que vous voulez?

965
01:03:41,975 --> 01:03:44,409
(Giggling and whispering)

966
01:03:49,255 --> 01:03:51,485
(Larita) 'She came for you? '

967
01:03:53,015 --> 01:03:54,368
Why the lie?

968
01:03:54,495 --> 01:03:57,885
She thought "wandering home"
sounded better.

969
01:04:00,415 --> 01:04:02,975
And to be perfectly frank,
I no longer cared.

970
01:04:04,695 --> 01:04:08,165
(# Gramophone plays "Pack Up
Your Troubles In Your Old Kit Bag")

971
01:04:08,295 --> 01:04:12,811
I hate new games. There are
too many balls, I can't sink anything.

972
01:04:12,935 --> 01:04:16,848
Sink some gin, Sausage Fingers!
- (Hilda) I never, ever win.

973
01:04:16,975 --> 01:04:18,886
Oh, well done!

974
01:04:24,775 --> 01:04:28,245
(Hilda) Stop sucking it. Come and help.
(Sarah) Come on, Pops.

975
01:04:28,375 --> 01:04:31,572
(Hurst) All right, Missie,
hold your horses.

976
01:04:31,695 --> 01:04:34,004
Right, clear the decks, puppies.

977
01:04:34,135 --> 01:04:35,887
May I?

978
01:04:42,935 --> 01:04:45,324
I was hoping to have a word.

979
01:04:45,455 --> 01:04:49,448
We're accentuating the positive today,
I don't have a mind for anything else.

980
01:04:49,575 --> 01:04:51,452
Of course... of course.

981
01:04:52,895 --> 01:04:55,455
I know you are
under considerable stress...

982
01:04:57,175 --> 01:04:58,972
Regarding what?

983
01:05:00,575 --> 01:05:03,851
Lord Hurst's kind offer
to buy into your property.

984
01:05:03,975 --> 01:05:07,809
The realtor I'm dealing with in London
also specialises in subdivision.

985
01:05:07,935 --> 01:05:12,247
Perhaps he could help negotiate
a premium price.

986
01:05:12,375 --> 01:05:15,765
Thank you, but really this is
of no concern of yours.

987
01:05:15,895 --> 01:05:19,968
Of course it's a concern. I am a member
of this family now and I'd like to help.

988
01:05:20,095 --> 01:05:23,132
And this is your interpretation
of "help", is it?

989
01:05:23,255 --> 01:05:26,486
Carving up our heritage and selling
it off to the highest bidder?

990
01:05:26,615 --> 01:05:29,083
Coming from a country no older
than the chair you are sitting in,

991
01:05:29,215 --> 01:05:31,171
it seems a very practical solution.

992
01:05:31,295 --> 01:05:33,809
Just forget the seven
generations of people

993
01:05:33,935 --> 01:05:37,530
who have devoted their entire lives
to farming this land.

994
01:05:37,655 --> 01:05:40,692
Get someone else to do it.
With a machine, no less.

995
01:05:41,695 --> 01:05:43,686
Who do you think you are?

996
01:05:44,855 --> 01:05:48,484
Swinging your wherewithal
like a cat on heat.

997
01:05:49,895 --> 01:05:53,251
If you really want to be
of assistance, Larita,

998
01:05:53,375 --> 01:05:55,843
I think you know what's required.

999
01:05:57,895 --> 01:05:59,851
Right...

1000
01:05:59,975 --> 01:06:03,650
I think it's time an expert showed you
how this game is played.

1001
01:06:03,775 --> 01:06:05,686
(Hurst) Watch it...

1002
01:06:05,815 --> 01:06:07,214
Bravo!

1003
01:06:08,575 --> 01:06:12,363
What a sportswoman, I must say.
Can you imagine? Fantastic!

1004
01:06:14,455 --> 01:06:16,446
(John) 'Lari, you're confusing me.'

1005
01:06:16,575 --> 01:06:19,453
(Lari) 'I'm feeling trapped.'
- 'I don't understand.'

1006
01:06:19,575 --> 01:06:22,612
It's this house!
It has an air of doom hanging over it.

1007
01:06:22,735 --> 01:06:25,727
And I can barely stand the weight
much longer.

1008
01:06:31,175 --> 01:06:33,928
The answer is to go abroad again.

1009
01:06:34,055 --> 01:06:38,446
Not yet. This is my life for now,
you know that.

1010
01:06:38,575 --> 01:06:41,692
And what part do I play in it?
- Do you have to be so loud?

1011
01:06:41,815 --> 01:06:44,488
Of course I do! I'm American.

1012
01:06:44,615 --> 01:06:46,685
(John laughs)

1013
01:06:50,015 --> 01:06:54,452
What is the use of bickering like this?
It doesn't lead anywhere.

1014
01:06:54,575 --> 01:06:57,408
You never know.
It might lead to a natural end.

1015
01:06:58,975 --> 01:07:01,011
Do you want it to?

1016
01:07:02,095 --> 01:07:04,245
Do you?

1017
01:07:04,375 --> 01:07:05,774
No!

1018
01:07:06,575 --> 01:07:09,567
I just want some peace and quiet.

1019
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:12,368
(Larita) You're far too young
to make a remark like that.

1020
01:07:12,495 --> 01:07:14,486
I can't help my age...

1021
01:07:15,735 --> 01:07:17,566
...Grandma.

1022
01:07:20,335 --> 01:07:25,648
Look, I'm sorry that I leave you alone
so much. Honestly, I'm sorry.

1023
01:07:28,055 --> 01:07:31,411
Good. Then let's do something about it.

1024
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:38,930
Why are we driving so fast?

1025
01:07:39,055 --> 01:07:41,046
The thrill of escape!

1026
01:07:41,175 --> 01:07:42,972
(Laughter)

1027
01:07:45,775 --> 01:07:49,051
(Hurst) You're looking very game today.
Fairest game in the land.

1028
01:07:50,535 --> 01:07:52,127
A penny for your thoughts?

1029
01:07:52,255 --> 01:07:54,849
It's more than pennies,
I'm afraid, Pinkie.

1030
01:07:54,975 --> 01:07:57,330
I don't think I can afford the party
this year.

1031
01:07:57,455 --> 01:07:59,969
But the Japanese lanterns!
- No, cancelled.

1032
01:08:00,095 --> 01:08:02,848
Had to choose,
Japanese lanterns or the maid.

1033
01:08:02,975 --> 01:08:08,003
You're not getting out of it that easily.
My offer of cellar and staff still stands.

1034
01:08:08,135 --> 01:08:11,525
It wouldn't be Christmas
without your knees-up.

1035
01:08:11,655 --> 01:08:12,804
(Gunshot)

1036
01:08:19,615 --> 01:08:21,492
(She sighs heavily)

1037
01:08:21,615 --> 01:08:26,894
Oh! This is the first piece of clarity
I've had since arriving. Whoo!

1038
01:08:30,375 --> 01:08:33,890
Why can't we live in moments
like these forever?

1039
01:08:34,015 --> 01:08:35,812
Why?

1040
01:08:35,935 --> 01:08:39,166
Because you've stopped
loving me, my darling!

1041
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:41,251
How can you say that?

1042
01:08:41,375 --> 01:08:44,253
Oh, I just open my mouth
and the words come out.

1043
01:08:45,135 --> 01:08:47,251
Then let's make a fresh start.

1044
01:09:02,015 --> 01:09:06,725
There are so many things I need
to tell you about me. Hard things.

1045
01:09:06,855 --> 01:09:08,573
I don't care.

1046
01:09:08,695 --> 01:09:10,492
I do.

1047
01:09:10,615 --> 01:09:14,813
It doesn't matter.
I trust you absolutely.

1048
01:09:15,255 --> 01:09:24,493
# I'll see you again
whenever Spring breaks through again...

1049
01:09:24,615 --> 01:09:25,843
Come on.

1050
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:30,773
# Time may lie heavy between

1051
01:09:31,575 --> 01:09:38,208
# But what has been
is past forgetting

1052
01:09:38,335 --> 01:09:43,125
# This sweet memory

1053
01:09:43,255 --> 01:09:49,444
# Throughout my life will come to me

1054
01:09:49,575 --> 01:09:53,887
# Though the world may go awry... #

1055
01:09:56,295 --> 01:09:57,489
(Man) Shot!

1056
01:09:57,615 --> 01:09:59,765
(Barking)

1057
01:10:01,135 --> 01:10:02,614
(Screams)

1058
01:10:02,735 --> 01:10:04,407
(Laughing)

1059
01:10:05,255 --> 01:10:06,654
(Gasps) John!

1060
01:10:08,535 --> 01:10:10,048
(Dog snarls)

1061
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:13,372
Top hole.
- Oh!

1062
01:10:13,495 --> 01:10:16,612
(Jim) I can't decide which is worse,
that you had to sneak outside

1063
01:10:16,735 --> 01:10:19,408
to get some privacy,
or that you were caught by Veronica.

1064
01:10:19,535 --> 01:10:21,287
(Larita) Who's Veronica?

1065
01:10:21,415 --> 01:10:23,565
I am. It's my name.

1066
01:10:23,695 --> 01:10:25,174
(Jim chuckles)

1067
01:10:26,615 --> 01:10:29,971
I fail to see the humour in it!
- No, darling, you're quite right.

1068
01:10:30,095 --> 01:10:33,326
I can certainly see the serious
implications. It's not a laughing matter.

1069
01:10:33,455 --> 01:10:35,252
It's only a laughing matter.

1070
01:10:35,375 --> 01:10:39,084
Indecent exposure is illegal.
Even in America.

1071
01:10:39,215 --> 01:10:41,206
Yep, yep...

1072
01:10:41,335 --> 01:10:43,803
You're right.
And we're very, very sorry, aren't we?

1073
01:10:43,935 --> 01:10:48,053
No, I'm not. This is my husband.
- And this is my home!

1074
01:10:48,175 --> 01:10:50,564
(Jim) Maybe it's time for them
to fly the nest?

1075
01:10:50,695 --> 01:10:54,404
Certainly not. They will stay put
and brazen this out.

1076
01:10:54,535 --> 01:10:57,413
And you can get that ghastly painting
out of my house!

1077
01:10:57,535 --> 01:11:00,288
We do not need any more reminders
of your easy virtue!

1078
01:11:01,215 --> 01:11:02,534
(Sighs heavily)

1079
01:11:10,175 --> 01:11:12,609
Excited, Furber?
- Overwhelmed, sir.

1080
01:11:12,735 --> 01:11:17,126
Miss Hilda...
- Uncle George... How explosive!

1081
01:11:17,255 --> 01:11:19,849
Furber, I recognise that as asparagus.

1082
01:11:19,975 --> 01:11:21,772
(Furber) Correct, Madam.

1083
01:11:21,895 --> 01:11:25,331
Ha! I pity poor Panda.
- Oh, what is it now?

1084
01:11:25,455 --> 01:11:30,404
Read! "The Detroit News".
Uncle George is a super sleuth!

1085
01:11:30,535 --> 01:11:33,811
Collecting old newspapers is
the last refuge of a truly boring man.

1086
01:11:33,935 --> 01:11:37,894
Boring? Far from it. It was a scandal!

1087
01:11:38,015 --> 01:11:40,609
Wasn't it... Mrs Morley?

1088
01:11:41,855 --> 01:11:44,847
Mrs Tom Morley of Detroit, Michigan.

1089
01:11:44,975 --> 01:11:47,091
(Jim) Don't be grotesque, Hilda.

1090
01:11:47,215 --> 01:11:51,527
Well, I suppose I'd better finish
my meal before it wilts entirely.

1091
01:11:51,655 --> 01:11:54,010
(Jim) Any dressing?
- Oh, I am genuinely shocked!

1092
01:11:54,135 --> 01:11:57,684
No thanks, I always end up wearing it.
- We've been hoodwinked!

1093
01:11:57,815 --> 01:12:00,124
Especially that runny vinaigrette.
- (Marion) Fire and brimstone!

1094
01:12:00,255 --> 01:12:02,132
Mayonnaise has more ballast.

1095
01:12:02,255 --> 01:12:05,486
Will you stop this insulting behaviour
immediately?

1096
01:12:11,015 --> 01:12:13,051
Oh, I always hated that photo of myself.

1097
01:12:13,175 --> 01:12:17,088
(Mrs Whittaker) Of everything I ever
expected, nothing prepared me for this.

1098
01:12:17,215 --> 01:12:19,775
(Jim) For what?
- She was charged with murder.

1099
01:12:19,895 --> 01:12:22,284
I was acquitted.
- And that's consolation?

1100
01:12:22,415 --> 01:12:25,725
I told you my husband died.
- But you didn't tell us how, did you?

1101
01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:27,766
Does John know about this?

1102
01:12:27,895 --> 01:12:30,125
(Hilda) I see...
- It's no concern of ours.

1103
01:12:30,255 --> 01:12:32,769
Father! Really!

1104
01:12:32,895 --> 01:12:35,648
Yes, and after Hilda went
to all that trouble digging it up.

1105
01:12:35,775 --> 01:12:38,130
I'm going outside for a cigarette.
Care to join me?

1106
01:12:38,255 --> 01:12:41,053
Thank you, Jim. Don't mind if I do.

1107
01:12:42,735 --> 01:12:44,373
No concern?

1108
01:12:49,495 --> 01:12:51,486
(Jim) The pack's closing.

1109
01:12:51,615 --> 01:12:54,652
This woman has taken advantage
of our son!

1110
01:12:54,775 --> 01:12:56,731
He'd never have married her
if he'd known.

1111
01:12:56,855 --> 01:12:59,608
You know that, do you?
- You'd have preferred we had an affair?

1112
01:12:59,735 --> 01:13:02,693
It would've been more appropriate!
- Mother!

1113
01:13:02,815 --> 01:13:06,728
Unfortunately, I agree with you!
- (Marion) It's easy to talk like this now.

1114
01:13:06,855 --> 01:13:10,768
It isn't easy, it's heartbreaking.
I love John, but it's not blind love.

1115
01:13:10,895 --> 01:13:12,089
(Marion snorts)

1116
01:13:12,215 --> 01:13:15,048
Marion, does that sound
indicate contempt or asthma?

1117
01:13:15,175 --> 01:13:17,405
You can't palm us off like that,
Mrs Morley.

1118
01:13:17,535 --> 01:13:19,526
(Jim) This is your doing.
You're a bigger fool than you look.

1119
01:13:19,655 --> 01:13:21,646
(Hilda) Larita is your type,
isn't she, Father?

1120
01:13:21,775 --> 01:13:24,209
(Larita) That is the nicest thing
any of you have ever said.

1121
01:13:24,335 --> 01:13:26,769
(John) Hello, are we having a picnic?

1122
01:13:28,375 --> 01:13:33,813
John... I think your wife better unveil
this one herself. Don't you, Larita?

1123
01:13:37,375 --> 01:13:38,854
Before we met...

1124
01:13:39,895 --> 01:13:43,854
...I was involved in a court case
over the death of my husband.

1125
01:13:43,975 --> 01:13:46,205
It was seedy and stressful,

1126
01:13:46,335 --> 01:13:49,133
but since I was found innocent

1127
01:13:49,255 --> 01:13:52,247
I didn't think it necessary
to burden you with the details.

1128
01:13:52,375 --> 01:13:53,603
Innocent?

1129
01:13:53,735 --> 01:13:56,533
She was responsible
for a man killing himself!

1130
01:13:56,655 --> 01:14:00,125
The verdict was suicide
but that's not where it started.

1131
01:14:00,255 --> 01:14:01,973
I thought it was cancer.

1132
01:14:02,615 --> 01:14:04,173
It was...

1133
01:14:04,295 --> 01:14:06,729
But he was so desperately sick.

1134
01:14:06,855 --> 01:14:09,927
If you'd known him, you would've
understood how forgivable it was.

1135
01:14:10,055 --> 01:14:12,410
It's not as if she poisoned him.
- That's what everyone thinks.

1136
01:14:12,535 --> 01:14:14,844
(Marion) She's a black widow.
- I pity you, Marion.

1137
01:14:14,975 --> 01:14:17,091
Really? Well, I won't let you!

1138
01:14:17,215 --> 01:14:21,413
Right, that's it! You have a dance
to organise, I suggest you all get to it!

1139
01:14:21,535 --> 01:14:23,127
Now!

1140
01:14:23,255 --> 01:14:24,927
(Marion whimpers)

1141
01:14:26,895 --> 01:14:29,363
(Mrs Whittaker) Hilda! Come on, inside!

1142
01:14:31,615 --> 01:14:33,367

(# Gramophone plays mournful song)

1144
01:14:41,615 --> 01:14:43,571
(Door opens and closes)

1145
01:14:46,215 --> 01:14:48,171
(Larita sobs)

1146
01:14:57,775 --> 01:15:00,767
Are you crying
because you're angry or ashamed?

1147
01:15:00,895 --> 01:15:02,692
(Larita sighs)

1148
01:15:02,815 --> 01:15:04,248
Neither.

1149
01:15:05,855 --> 01:15:10,133
Coming here has been the most
demoralising experience of my life.

1150
01:15:15,135 --> 01:15:18,093
Why didn't you tell me?

1151
01:15:18,215 --> 01:15:20,649
I wanted to,
everything just happened so fast.

1152
01:15:20,775 --> 01:15:22,845
That's not good enough.

1153
01:15:24,135 --> 01:15:26,888
I tried to, several times.

1154
01:15:28,615 --> 01:15:32,369
But you trusted me..."absolutely".

1155
01:15:34,295 --> 01:15:38,083
And you saw the field day
those fatuous hypocrites made of it.

1156
01:15:38,215 --> 01:15:40,126
Please remember they're my family.

1157
01:15:40,255 --> 01:15:42,723
I shouldn't think of them at all
if they weren't.

1158
01:15:42,855 --> 01:15:47,007
Still... you should have told me.

1159
01:15:48,535 --> 01:15:50,526
You should have loved me more.

1160
01:15:52,535 --> 01:15:54,605
I couldn't love you any more.

1161
01:15:54,735 --> 01:15:57,203
You should have loved me better.

1162
01:16:00,215 --> 01:16:02,410
I don't understand you, Larita.

1163
01:16:04,415 --> 01:16:06,849
I don't understand you at all.

1164
01:16:09,935 --> 01:16:12,051

1165
01:16:16,815 --> 01:16:18,885

1... 2... 3... Are you all left feet?

1168
01:16:31,695 --> 01:16:35,608
Dancing with you
is like trying to move a piano.

1169
01:16:35,735 --> 01:16:38,010
I wonder what the American
will be wearing.

1170
01:16:38,135 --> 01:16:40,285
Or who she'll be poisoning!

1171
01:16:42,975 --> 01:16:46,251
Do you like long, moonlit walks?

1172
01:16:46,375 --> 01:16:48,843

who annoy me.

1173

You've got me all to yourself.
Larita's upstairs with a headache.

1174
01:16:52,935 --> 01:16:56,132

gave her that?

(# Music finishes)

1176

You ought to see if Larita is coping.
- I already have. She's fine.

1177
01:17:16,255 --> 01:17:19,725
It's been a very trying day
for her, John.

1178

Go and escort your wife down.
- No, I wouldn't worry.

1179

You know my wife, she'll make
an entrance when she's ready.

1181
01:17:31,375 --> 01:17:33,127

01:17:48,815 --> 01:17:50,692
Watching.

1186
01:17:52,215 --> 01:17:55,252
People are so universally similar
when their guard is down.

1187
01:17:55,375 --> 01:17:58,526
(Arguing)
- (Woman) Oh, hello! Ha-ha!

1188
01:18:01,535 --> 01:18:05,528
It seems they are universally similar
when their guard is up, as well.

1189
01:18:08,455 --> 01:18:09,854
May I?

1190
01:18:11,815 --> 01:18:15,933
Thank you for being gallant today.
- You are damn cool in a crisis.

1191
01:18:17,295 --> 01:18:20,367
The judge at my trial
said something similar.

1192
01:18:22,455 --> 01:18:24,525
Why did you do it?

1193
01:18:26,975 --> 01:18:29,330
Why did you marry John?

1194
01:18:30,815 --> 01:18:34,330
My first husband was older,
and his end was messy.

1195
01:18:36,295 --> 01:18:38,411
Long afterwards, this...

1196
01:18:39,975 --> 01:18:41,249
...boy...

1197
01:18:41,375 --> 01:18:46,324
...this pure boy arrived
fresh and unblemished.

1198
01:18:49,415 --> 01:18:52,691
I married him because
any other relationship seemed...

1199
01:18:53,535 --> 01:18:56,208
...cheap and squalid.

1200
01:18:57,935 --> 01:19:02,247
My first marriage cost me my youth,
and here I am stealing someone else's.

1201
01:19:04,215 --> 01:19:05,807
What will you do?

01:23:24,375 --> 01:23:27,970
Have you been drinking, Furber?
- Yes, Madam. Prodigiously.

1225
01:23:28,095 --> 01:23:30,689
You are full of surprises.
- Oh, yes, Madam.

1226
01:23:30,815 --> 01:23:32,806
I was even arrested once.

1227
01:23:32,935 --> 01:23:34,766
What for?
- Bigamy.

1228
01:23:42,855 --> 01:23:45,733
(Mrs Whittaker) Ah, there you are,
Pinkie, I've found you.

1229
01:23:56,095 --> 01:23:58,131
Larita, where are you going?

1230
01:23:58,255 --> 01:24:01,008
Away, Sarah. For John's sake.

1231
01:24:01,135 --> 01:24:02,807
Far, far away.

1232
01:24:03,895 --> 01:24:05,931
Is there anything I can do?

1233
01:24:06,055 --> 01:24:08,330
You can look after him.

1234
01:24:08,455 --> 01:24:11,970
Women like me are tiresome in love.
We expect too much.

1235
01:24:13,775 --> 01:24:17,404
Marry John. It's the way things
always should've been.

1236
01:24:17,535 --> 01:24:22,051
I'm just so sorry I got in the way.
- You love him that much?

1237
01:24:23,895 --> 01:24:25,965
(Sighs)

1238
01:24:26,095 --> 01:24:28,211
(Footsteps approach)

1239
01:24:28,335 --> 01:24:30,690
Go. I'll cover for you.

1240
01:24:30,815 --> 01:24:32,453
Sweet Sarah.

1241
01:24:32,575 --> 01:24:35,692
So glad you've recovered
from your headache.

1242
01:24:35,815 --> 01:24:38,648
Please don't build any convenient
social lies on my behalf.

1243
01:24:38,775 --> 01:24:43,166
I say, Mother is only...
- Fighting to keep the charade alive?

1244
01:24:43,295 --> 01:24:46,526
You've shown tremendous fortitude
holding this family together, Veronica,

1245
01:24:46,655 --> 01:24:48,373
and I can respect that.

1246
01:24:48,495 --> 01:24:53,011
What I can't respect is the manipulative
road you've chosen to maintain control.

1247
01:24:53,135 --> 01:24:56,286
This war is over. Move on.

1248
01:24:56,415 --> 01:24:58,849
"Move on." Oh, how convenient.

1249
01:24:58,975 --> 01:25:03,173
(Larita) Oh, wake up, Marion.
Edgar's not coming back.

1250
01:25:03,295 --> 01:25:05,331
And that ring isn't stuck, you are.

1251
01:25:05,455 --> 01:25:09,892
And Hilda, you've got such promise,
yet you're squandering it on malice.

1252
01:25:10,015 --> 01:25:11,846
My advice to both you girls?

1253
01:25:12,735 --> 01:25:16,444
Run! Go see the world
through your own eyes.

1254
01:25:16,575 --> 01:25:17,894
(Snorts)

1255
01:25:18,015 --> 01:25:21,451
So speaks the siren,
leading the sailors to their death.

1256
01:25:21,575 --> 01:25:24,692
At least I'm not Medusa,
turning them to stone.

1257
01:25:24,815 --> 01:25:28,774
Get out!
- (John) Larita? Lari?

1258
01:25:29,615 --> 01:25:32,448
Lari, don't go.
- John, I have to.

1259
01:25:32,575 --> 01:25:35,885
I can't live here. Nothing can.

1260
01:25:36,015 --> 01:25:39,405
But you're my wife, and I love you.

1261
01:25:40,735 --> 01:25:42,726
Oh, John, my darling...

1262
01:25:44,775 --> 01:25:47,289
You don't know what love is.

1263
01:25:47,415 --> 01:25:51,567
You have no idea what it means
to love someone so much

1264
01:25:51,695 --> 01:25:54,289
that you will do anything for them.

1265
01:25:57,975 --> 01:26:00,535
Even inject them with poison

1266
01:26:00,655 --> 01:26:04,045
when they were too feeble
to do it for themselves.

1267
01:26:09,495 --> 01:26:12,646
I don't believe that you could've
ever loved me like that.

1268
01:26:20,975 --> 01:26:22,727
Oh, John, let her go.

1269
01:26:25,415 --> 01:26:30,773
Let her go, off into the sunset
to inject another family with her poison!

1270
01:26:30,895 --> 01:26:32,806
(John) Mother...
(Mrs Whittaker) Off you go!

1271
01:26:32,935 --> 01:26:35,210
Before your past
catches up with you... again!

1272
01:26:35,335 --> 01:26:36,973
(John) Mother!

1273
01:26:39,415 --> 01:26:41,645
Oh, you evil...

1274
01:26:41,775 --> 01:26:43,845
Mother! Shut up!

1275
01:26:46,975 --> 01:26:49,364
They are predicting warmer weather,
Madam.

1276
01:26:49,495 --> 01:26:52,487
Yes, Furber, I believe they are.
Thank you.

1277
01:26:57,495 --> 01:26:58,894
Very generous.

1278
01:27:00,135 --> 01:27:03,252
There's something special in there
for Jackson. Make sure he gets it.

1279
01:27:03,375 --> 01:27:06,173
Of course.
Where will Madam be staying?

1280
01:27:07,175 --> 01:27:08,574
Who knows?

1281
01:27:09,295 --> 01:27:10,774
Good luck.

1282
01:27:11,975 --> 01:27:13,647
And you, Furber.

1283
01:27:14,575 --> 01:27:17,043
Would you forward the painting please,
Furber?

1284
01:27:17,175 --> 01:27:19,370
To where, sir?

1285
01:27:25,495 --> 01:27:28,328
I shall enjoy passing on
the good news, sir.

1286
01:27:32,175 --> 01:27:37,727
(Jim) Well, my dear, when the going
gets tough, the tough get going.

1287
01:27:37,855 --> 01:27:41,928
(Larita) # I've got something to tell you
(Jim) Really?

1288
01:27:42,935 --> 01:27:45,893
(Larita) # I got something to say
(Jim) I'm all ears.

1289
01:27:46,015 --> 01:27:50,611
(Larita) # I'm going to put
these wheels in motion

1290
01:27:50,735 --> 01:27:54,205
# And let nothing stand in my way...

1291
01:27:54,855 --> 01:27:55,685
(Cork pops)

1292
01:27:55,815 --> 01:28:00,047
(Chorus) # Darling,
I'll climb any mountain

1293
01:28:00,175 --> 01:28:03,850
# Darling, I'll do anything

1294
01:28:03,975 --> 01:28:06,569
# When the going gets tough

1295
01:28:08,615 --> 01:28:11,288
# The tough get going

1296
01:28:12,775 --> 01:28:15,687
# When the going gets rough

1297
01:28:17,375 --> 01:28:19,809
# The tough get rough

1298
01:28:21,855 --> 01:28:24,972
# Gonna get myself across the river

1299
01:28:25,895 --> 01:28:29,604
# That's the price that I'm willing to pay

1300
01:28:29,735 --> 01:28:34,251
# I'm gonna make you stand and deliver

1301
01:28:34,375 --> 01:28:38,607
# And give me love
in that old-fashioned way

1302
01:28:38,735 --> 01:28:43,650
# Oh, darling,
I'll climb any mountain

1303
01:28:43,775 --> 01:28:47,404
# Darling, I'll do anything

1304
01:28:47,535 --> 01:28:50,129
# Cos when the going gets tough

1305
01:28:52,135 --> 01:28:54,774
# The tough get going

1306

# When the going gets rough

1307
