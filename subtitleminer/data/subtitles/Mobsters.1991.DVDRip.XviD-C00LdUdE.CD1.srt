1
00:01:28,855 --> 00:01:31,653
<i>Here we go.
Come on.</i>

2
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,615
Come on, seven!

3
00:02:07,927 --> 00:02:10,657
What are you doing
at the house of God?

4
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:30,607
<i>This is where I grew up.
Mott Street.</i>

5
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:34,676
<i>I'm Charlie Luciano. In my
neighborhood there were two dons.</i>

6
00:02:34,787 --> 00:02:37,654
<i>Two bosses, each fightin'
for control of New York.</i>

7
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:41,249
<i>And sometimes innocent people
got caught in the middle.</i>

8
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:44,330
I got a right to
drink a glass of wine!

9
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,024
I got a right to find work
that uses my brain!

10
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:50,296
You clean the fish and the
calamari, just like me!

11
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:54,863
What are you sayin'? 'Cause I'm a greasy
immigrant, all I can do is clean fish?

12
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:57,499
That ain't enough, Pop!

13
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,845
<i>Buon giorno.</i>

14
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:11,849
<i>Che cazzo "buon giorno."
You come in my house, hmm?</i>

15
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:15,086
You tell the
son of a bitch Faranzano,

16
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,959
<i>the miserabile bestia.
I give him...</i>

17
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:20,191
<i>Oh.
Don Faranzano.</i>

18
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,564
Faranzano.

19
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:26,196
Faranzano, I no
mean what I say.

20
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:30,800
You have been very loyal.
Done favors for me.

21
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:34,812
Always made your
payments on time.

22
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:39,851
Now, you've stopped paying.
I have to ask myself, "Why?"

23
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:45,118
<i>No, no. Faranzano,
Mia piccola bambina she's sick.</i>

24
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:48,626
I no have the money.
I no got the money.

25
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:53,159
<i>Fat pig.</i>

26
00:03:57,837 --> 00:04:03,571
When I came from Sicily,
you went with me.

27
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:09,376
Now, you're drifting back
to that fat pig, Masseria.

28
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:12,918
- No! Faranzano...
- You are, I see.

29
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:15,510
<i>No, no, no.
Tu sei mi padrone... Aaah!</i>

30
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:18,251
I can't take chances.

31
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:22,158
<i>If one man can desert me,
everybody can. Understand?</i>

32
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:25,296
Yes.

33
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:29,266
If you have to sell your
daughter, you will pay!

34
00:04:35,908 --> 00:04:38,433
You have a pretty wife.

35
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:42,446
Usually, after children,

36
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:45,984
they get fat.

37
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:55,993
Nice sweet taste.

38
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:58,859
<i>Disgraziato!
Get out of my house!</i>

39
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:06,029
I felt your balls, so I
know why she needs her own.

40
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:17,515
<i>Figlio mio,
put down the knife.</i>

41
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:20,450
You'll have your
chance one day.

42
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:34,828
<i>That was one boss.</i>

43
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:37,994
<i>Don Faranzano.</i>

44
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:41,232
<i>Some things change
your life forever.</i>

45
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:46,267
<i>Yeah, I know.
I know. Loyalty.</i>

46
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:49,371
My father sweated
blood for him.

47
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:53,646
<i>The guy with me here is Frankie
Costello. Loyalty, Frankie, yeah?</i>

48
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:57,211
<i>He and Joey DeCarlo were my
two best friends. ThatJoey?</i>

49
00:05:57,323 --> 00:06:00,781
<i>But on these streets
friends were hard to keep.</i>

50
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:15,432
<i>Don Masseria!
Don Masseria!</i>

51
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:20,774
<i>Lo bisogno, per favore.
Chi e chieste?</i>

52
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,280
Look at this.

53
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,681
<i>Lo bisogno aiuto,
per favore.</i>

54
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:27,753
<i>Chi e chieste?</i>

55
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:29,981
No, don't!

56
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:32,649
<i>Sono sangue.</i>

57
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:37,162
Terrible what these
niggers are doin'.

58
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:41,962
They come down from Harlem,
kill my own nephew.

59
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:45,094
Right in front
of my face.

60
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:53,577
<i>My son!</i>

61
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:58,412
<i>Oh!
Oh, no, my God!</i>

62
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:05,521
Oh, my son!

63
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,650
<i>Joey!</i>

64
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,251
Oh, Joey!

65
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:14,197
Oh, Joey!
Oh, my God! Oh, Joey!

66
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:20,263
<i>That was the other boss.</i>

67
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:23,137
<i>Don Masseria.</i>

68
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:25,972
<i>Some way, some time,</i>

69
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:28,603
<i>no matter how
long it took,</i>

70
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:31,376
<i>I knew what
I had to do...</i>

71
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:34,180
<i>to both bosses.</i>

72
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,755
He kills his own blood,
you know?

73
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:39,416
I mean his own nephew.
What kind of man is that, huh?

74
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:41,550
And on top of that,
he pays some in'ish to do it.

75
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:43,652
Uh! Ah!

76
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:47,790
<i>The law of the street was:
Take or be taken.</i>

77
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:52,098
<i>Everybody fought everybody.
in'ish, Italians, Germans, Jews.</i>

78
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:55,766
<i>But this was different. This was
that in'ishman who killed Joey.</i>

79
00:07:55,875 --> 00:08:00,209
<i>Beatin'up on some skinny
Jewish kid, Meyer Lansky.</i>

80
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:03,043
<i>And theJewish kid
wouldn't stay down.</i>

81
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:06,880
<i>Meyer wouldn't give
no matter how bad he got it.</i>

82
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:10,979
<i>You had to respect that.</i>

83
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,888
<i>Meyer's big pal was Benny
Siegel. Leave him alone!</i>

84
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:16,018
<i>Benny loved a good fight.</i>

85
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:19,859
<i>Even a bad fight, but they
wouldn't let him in on this one.</i>

86
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:23,458
What is it? You in love
with the littleJew boy? No.

87
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:26,060
Joey was
a friend of mine!

88
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:41,948
<i>Meyer!</i>

89
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:46,018
What the hell's
everybody looking at?

90
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:49,219
He just
saved your life.

91
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:52,263
<i>Come on.</i>

92
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:55,459
Let's get the
fuck out of here.

93
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:04,643
<i>So that's how we started.</i>

94
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:08,703
<i>Two Italians and twoJews.
Funny combination, huh?</i>

95
00:09:08,814 --> 00:09:11,874
<i>Frankie... he liked to worry,
so he paid off the cops.</i>

96
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:14,384
<i>Benny liked to brawl,
so he was our muscle.</i>

97
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:17,012
<i>And me and Meyer...
we were both the leader.</i>

98
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:19,182
<i>At least it
started out that way.</i>

99
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:21,192
<i>Just four mugs
off the street.</i>

100
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:23,956
<i>At fin'st we were penny-ante,
but together we grew.</i>

101
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:26,998
Thing that worries me is
things is goin' too good.

102
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:29,966
Relax.
How can I relax?

103
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,902
When everything's goin' right,
you know it's gonna go wrong.

104
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:36,839
We can't keep operating like four
kids running around the neighborhood.

105
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:41,539
That's what I mean. If we're
going to expand, we need a leader.

106
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:43,740
And who's that
gonna be, huh?

107
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:46,340
Tommy's meetin'
us over here.

108
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:48,943
After you. Please, be my guest.

109
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,580
Thank you.

110
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,785
<i>I got 'em comin'up
right now, sin'.</i>

111
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:59,956
Do like I said with the kid. Okay.

112
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:02,534
What is this, huh?
You'll see.

113
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:04,899
<i>Charlie, come sta?</i>

114
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:08,064
How's everything?
Meyer. Good to see you.

115
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:10,472
I got everything ready
for you in the back.

116
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:14,676
What do you got
to show me, huh?

117
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,839
It's a little
experiment.

118
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:20,350
You asked me a question.
I'm gonna answer it.

119
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:24,856
Come here.
Yeah.

120
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:29,887
<i>He's telling this kid
there's a guy here,</i>

121
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:34,296
very powerful, successful,
who's got a job for him.

122
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,334
Easy money.

123
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:40,303
You got that?
Good, get out of here.

124
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,642
Let's go.

125
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,376
<i>Now he realizes.</i>

126
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:56,686
Bugsy didn't tell him,
right? Me or you.

127
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:24,916
Got a job for me?

128
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:30,389
You just did it, kid.

129
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:34,291
Get lost.

130
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:41,963
<i>Now do
you see?</i>

131
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:46,027
Between you and me,
we're equals.

132
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:49,972
But other people,
they look to you.

133
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:52,874
What're you sayin', huh?
I'm your front man?

134
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:55,105
No.

135
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:58,980
This ain't a con, Charlie.
You're it.

136
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:01,815
<i>You're the one.</i>

137
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:07,392
Tommy Reina,
Charlie, Meyer.

138
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:10,428
Good pal, gonna even
be a better partner.

139
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:12,861
From your mouth
to God's ear, hmm?

140
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:17,026
He's got a line on the
good stuff. How good?

141
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:19,764
Bottle in Bond
Scotch Whiskey.

142
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:23,205
I got a friend got a boxcar
sittin' on a spur in Philly.

143
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:27,143
He wants 35 G's.
I only got 10.

144
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:31,342
Ahhh.
Who's this friend?

145
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,418
Arnold Rothstein.

146
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:38,786
No disrespect, Tommy. Why would Rothstein
wanna do business with bums like us?

147
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:43,123
'Cause some of us are
Jewish bums. Right?

148
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:47,131
You'll find out Monday night
when you go to his hotel.

149
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:53,603
No one ever
called you all bums.

150
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:56,106
Come on.

151
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:59,501
It's very
good stuff.

152
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:03,279
<i>Come on in, fellas.</i>

153
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:06,613
I want you to meet the genius
who fixed the World Series.

154
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:09,984
<i>Mr. Arnold Rothstein.</i>

155
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:13,555
This here's
Charlie Luciano...

156
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:15,559
<i>and Meyer Lansky.</i>

157
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:19,529
<i>Tommy, thanks.
Yeah.</i>

158
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,760
Well, sit down.
Sit down.

159
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:27,170
<i>Mr. Luciano,</i>

160
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:29,366
you're walking
down the street.

161
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,875
Suddenly you realize
you're being followed. It's a hit.

162
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:34,445
Walking toward you
is a second gunman.

163
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:37,072
You have time to fin'e at only
one of them. Which one do...

164
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:41,586
I don't accept the question.
To live, I gotta kill 'em both.

165
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,388
Next,

166
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,050
<i>your wife... I don't have a wife.</i>

167
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:51,789
- Why not?
- Emotion is dangerous.

168
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:55,833
- Arert you human?
- Would it help?

169
00:13:55,935 --> 00:14:01,396
Next. I have ships
and distilleries in Scotland.

170
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,498
I need distribution
in New York.

171
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:06,942
<i>Masseria? Faranzano? They'd kill me.</i>

172
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:10,243
- I won't?
- You haveJewish partners.

173
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:15,352
Maybe I kill them too.

174
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:18,949
<i>You can't afford to.</i>

175
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:24,553
You're in the squeeze. Masseria
has 700 soldiers. Faranzano, 600.

176
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:28,724
Either one realizes you exist,
they squash you like an ant.

177
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:33,969
Unless I get a
powerful friend, huh?

178
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:36,667
<i>Exactly.</i>

179
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:39,642
Next.

180
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:43,146
What's the
secret of America?

181
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:46,412
What's the matter with
this guy? I'm 24 years old...

182
00:14:46,518 --> 00:14:49,146
Money!

183
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:52,691
Everything is
money, Charlie.

184
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:55,783
Don't ever forget it.

185
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:59,194
But you, you'll
never make any money.

186
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:03,792
- Why's that?
- You dress like a schmuck.

187
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:17,441
Ah-ha.

188
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:24,817
Let's do
some business.

189
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:38,833
Check it.

190
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,816
<i>It's raining money.</i>

191
00:15:52,918 --> 00:15:54,818
We got money
to burn, Charlie.

192
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,150
Wanna burn some?
Want to? Want to?

193
00:15:57,256 --> 00:16:00,054
Be my guest.
All right!

194
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:05,329
Everybody ready?

195
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:07,558
The party.
Our fin'st million.

196
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:10,635
<i>Paisan, you ready to make
some money? I'm ready.</i>

197
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:13,534
- I'm always ready.
- Just don't hog all the broads.

198
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,199
I can't help it.
They're all over me.

199
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:19,835
<i>Tell us something we
don't know, huh? Gentlemen,</i>

200
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:24,075
before we go,
let's have a toast.

201
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:26,549
Our fin'st
million dollars.

202
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:31,282
Say this bottle is bootleg
business, greater New York.

203
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:36,293
This is our business
when we started.

204
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:39,887
Nobody noticed us,
nobody gave a shit.

205
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:45,665
Now this is our
business right now.

206
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:48,205
It's big enough for
us to have a party.

207
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:52,539
Big enough for
other people to notice.

208
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:06,617
This is where we want
our business to be.

209
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:09,387
But the bigger we get,

210
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:13,829
the more we're taking
from other people.

211
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:16,696
Thanks. Masseria's already calling us.

212
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:20,863
Faranzano, calling.

213
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:25,376
<i>You see what I'm saying?
Yeah. I didn't get no whiskey.</i>

214
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:27,809
I'm saying this.

215
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,611
If we're
not careful...

216
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:40,950
<i>Charlie!
Hey.</i>

217
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,858
I got the room
in the back for ya's.

218
00:17:43,962 --> 00:17:46,294
Father,
how are you?

219
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:50,426
Tommy, you bum,
you look beautiful.

220
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:55,106
How you doin'?
Good to see you.

221
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:03,906
<i>The table looks beautiful.</i>

222
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:06,849
Hey!
Giovanni!

223
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,523
<i>People will love
to play numbers.</i>

224
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:21,190
It's smart business. Somebody
hits big, you gotta publicize.

225
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,461
All right. I'll get
somebody downtown.

226
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:29,365
Excuse me,
gentlemen.

227
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:36,839
<i>Anna Citron,
these are my partners.</i>

228
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,474
<i>Frank Costello.
Hello.</i>

229
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:43,385
<i>Benny Siegel.
Hi.</i>

230
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:50,053
And um, these are
thein' girlfriends.

231
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:53,495
<i>He has two girlfriends? At least.</i>

232
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:57,999
<i>Salute.</i>

233
00:18:58,103 --> 00:19:02,130
<i>Charlie, this is my girl.</i>

234
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:05,677
I want you to meet
Anna Citron.

235
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:07,506
My goodness,
I'm honored.

236
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,480
Sit down.

237
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:14,814
You met my priest? Anna Citron,
this is Meyer Lansky. Hello.

238
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,889
<i>This here is Father Bonotto.
Buona sera, signorina.</i>

239
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,185
<i>Buona sera.</i>

240
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:25,320
Father! Ah, Tommy, you stupid
bootlegger from the Bronx.

241
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,421
Charlie,
I want to talk to you.

242
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:31,162
You see, this is why
alcohol is outlawed.

243
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:34,364
You son of a bitches, uh?

244
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:41,774
They're threatening us.
Then talk to the bosses.

245
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,008
You mean buy ourselves
some time. Exactly.

246
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:47,381
I agree.

247
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:52,648
Hey, Frankie.
We made it.

248
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:58,354
Let me tell you this.
Watch your back, all right?

249
00:19:58,463 --> 00:20:01,364
Good.
Yeah.

250
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:08,470
So,

251
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:13,876
you talked to Rothstein?
Yeah. He worries too much.

252
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:17,278
So do I.

253
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:20,613
Faranzano wants to
meet in the morning.

254
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:25,156
I think we should go.
Not yet. Let him beg.

255
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:27,987
<i>He is begging.</i>

256
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:30,084
Aaah!

257
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:47,976
Meyer!

258
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:01,649
Aaah!

259
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:06,462
Move! Move!

260
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:10,095
<i>You okay, Meyer?</i>

261
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:13,035
Anna?
Yeah.

262
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:17,040
- That's twice I saved your life.
- You're telling me.

263
00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:19,736
I hate owing somebody.

264
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:23,838
Listen, we're meeting
Faranzano in the morning.

265
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,474
Whatever you say, Meyer. Good.

266
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:28,348
<i>You all right,
Anna?</i>

267
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:49,373
Don Faranzano.

268
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:56,611
Have we met?

269
00:21:56,715 --> 00:21:58,808
Maybe around
the neighborhood.

270
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:01,181
When I
was a kid.

271
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:04,517
This is my associate,
Meyer Lansky.

272
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:08,650
I don't talk
business with Jews.

273
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:12,355
<i>You talk business with me. If Meyer
works with me, that ain't your concern.</i>

274
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:14,762
Let's be blunt.

275
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:17,596
If you go with Masseria,
maybe he wins.

276
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:19,830
If you go with me,
maybe I win.

277
00:22:19,938 --> 00:22:22,338
This seems to give you
a lot of power.

278
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:25,638
So what're you
offering me?

279
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:28,212
Masseria's the boss of
all bosses. I respect him.

280
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:31,841
He's a fat pig.

281
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:35,613
<i>I offer you this.</i>

282
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:39,919
Join my family.
We combine all operations.

283
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:42,220
You'll get
15 percent.

284
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:46,024
Yes?

285
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,294
Well, it's a very
handsome offer.

286
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:54,463
<i>We have to think it over. That means no.</i>

287
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:58,475
Means what it means. We have
to talk with our partners.

288
00:22:58,577 --> 00:23:00,977
Show them out.

289
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:17,887
Fifteen percent, huh?

290
00:23:17,996 --> 00:23:20,464
You know how much
money that is?

291
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:24,262
Well, I don't,
and neither do you.

292
00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:26,769
But it's a hell of a lot.

293
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:28,999
Fifteen percent?

294
00:23:29,107 --> 00:23:33,168
As soon as we sold to Faranzano,
he'd knock you off.

295
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:36,611
<i>Why would he do that? You're Sicilian.</i>

296
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:38,910
One day you
might wanna be boss.

297
00:23:39,017 --> 00:23:41,986
If he iced you now,
there would be a stink,

298
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:46,114
but if you're workin' for him,
who's gonna come after him?

299
00:23:46,224 --> 00:23:49,523
Who is gonna give
a fucking shit, except us.

300
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:51,994
And we'd be history.

301
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,793
He's right, Charlie.

302
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:59,536
That's why we're in partnership
with theseJews, Frankie.

303
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:07,811
Excuse me.

304
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:11,144
How're you, Charlie?
Right this way.

305
00:24:11,249 --> 00:24:14,377
<i>Show Mr. Luciano his table.</i>

306
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:16,613
Hey, Charlie!

307
00:24:16,721 --> 00:24:19,849
Nice to see ya.
Good to see you.

308
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:22,426
I heard you told
Faranzano to go fly.

309
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:25,826
I told him I'd think it
over. Always so polite?

310
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:28,331
Now you come to
seeJoe, the boss?

311
00:24:28,433 --> 00:24:32,369
It's a very smart move, Charlie.
Everybody needs protection.

312
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,564
Even me.

313
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:37,904
Where is he? He's up in his balcony.

314
00:24:45,784 --> 00:24:47,809
You oughta come
aboard, Charlie.

315
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:50,149
We're just one big pasta-eatin'
family over here. All right.

316
00:24:50,255 --> 00:24:52,519
I'll see you later. All right.

317
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:04,263
Hi.

318
00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:07,270
Hi.

319
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:17,140
Geez.

320
00:25:24,122 --> 00:25:26,147
<i>I don't believe my eyes.</i>

321
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:30,592
It's me. Hey, Charlie!
Come on, sit down.

322
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:36,565
I send messages, send flowers
and you don't come to see me.

323
00:25:36,668 --> 00:25:41,435
I had some things I had to
straighten out with Faranzano.

324
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:47,740
I heard. You won't marry him...
that's beautiful.

325
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:52,476
Still, you won't go to bed with me,
and I'm so gorgeous.

326
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:56,384
I know. I've always held
a warm spot for you, Joe.

327
00:25:56,488 --> 00:26:01,448
<i>Your nephewJoey
was a friend of mine.</i>

328
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,552
It's too bad,
Charlie.

329
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:08,411
<i>Charlie,
you belong in this family.</i>

330
00:26:08,446 --> 00:26:11,092
<i>Charlie,
you belong in this family.</i>

331
00:26:11,202 --> 00:26:14,569
Someday I will
join you, Joe.

332
00:26:14,673 --> 00:26:19,736
- You don't like today?
- No. No, I don't like it.

333
00:26:19,844 --> 00:26:25,783
It's too bad, Charlie.
I've seen a lot come and go.

334
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:28,182
Guys just like you.

335
00:26:28,286 --> 00:26:32,416
<i>The ones who come, they come
to me. The ones who go...</i>

336
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:38,157
I'm the guy
who sends them off.

337
00:26:41,032 --> 00:26:43,159
Hey, you want
a little broccoli?

338
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:46,635
- No. No, thank you.
- Come on, it's full of garlic.

339
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:50,868
It looks wonderful, but I
gotta get back downstain's.

340
00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:53,206
Enjoy the show.

341
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:57,839
What do you think?
I don't trust him.

342
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:01,942
You don't trust anybody.
I doubt that you trust me.

343
00:27:02,053 --> 00:27:04,613
He's stringing us along. Yeah.

344
00:28:14,659 --> 00:28:16,559
Hi.

345
00:28:16,661 --> 00:28:19,960
You boys enjoy the
show? Park it here, baby.

346
00:28:20,065 --> 00:28:22,465
How're you doin'?

347
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:25,468
Great. Couldrt be better.
Got a light?

348
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:29,904
A light? For you,
I'd burn down this whole joint.

349
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:47,424
Excuse me, Joe. I hate to interrupt,
but can I talk to my sister?

350
00:28:47,525 --> 00:28:49,322
<i>This is
your sister?</i>

351
00:28:49,427 --> 00:28:52,885
<i>Yeah. Go ahead. Be my guest.</i>

352
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:58,998
It's nothin'.
Just relax. Whoa!

353
00:28:59,104 --> 00:29:02,267
Thanks.
No problem.

354
00:29:02,373 --> 00:29:06,605
It's not really my favorite
part the job. I could see that.

355
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:19,323
<i>It's a nice... nice outfit.
Thanks.</i>

356
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:23,455
What's your name?

357
00:29:23,561 --> 00:29:28,123
Mara Motes. Somebody said
you're Charlie Luciano.

358
00:29:28,233 --> 00:29:32,329
Let's just say I'm somebody
who believes in his friends.

359
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,667
Good.

360
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:38,641
Maybe you and I can
be friends sometime.

361
00:29:38,743 --> 00:29:43,976
Yeah. Yeah. I could pick you
up after the show if you like.

362
00:29:46,184 --> 00:29:49,676
You sure you
wanna do that?

363
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:55,454
If you want to be somebody's
friend, it takes time, doesn't it?

364
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:59,223
I guess it does.

365
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:02,788
I should
really get back.

366
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:05,369
Okay.

367
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,404
Bye.

368
00:30:07,505 --> 00:30:09,496
Bye.

369
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:16,079
Friends, huh?

370
00:30:24,689 --> 00:30:28,955
<i>Yeah? Charlie, it's Meyer. We got hit.</i>

371
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:31,324
<i>We got no shipment
New Year's Eve.</i>

372
00:30:31,429 --> 00:30:34,557
<i>We gotta see Rothstein.
Right.</i>

373
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,600
<i>Now!</i>

374
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:50,379
We're supposed to meet
Mr. Rothstein.

375
00:30:50,481 --> 00:30:53,780
Yes.
Of course.

376
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:57,013
Hey, you know
where to find me.

377
00:31:01,993 --> 00:31:05,793
I'm Benny Siegel. You
heard of me? No, not really.

378
00:31:05,897 --> 00:31:10,459
What do you do?
I kill people.

379
00:31:15,106 --> 00:31:18,667
<i>Who hit us? Masseria or
Faranzano? Probably Masseria.</i>

380
00:31:18,776 --> 00:31:20,710
But who knows?
Could be either one.

381
00:31:20,812 --> 00:31:23,838
I'm the fin'st guy
to worry,

382
00:31:23,948 --> 00:31:27,543
but doesn't
everybody get hijacked.

383
00:31:27,652 --> 00:31:31,850
You think this was
business as usual?

384
00:31:31,956 --> 00:31:35,221
I shouldn't have to
explain this to you!

385
00:31:37,262 --> 00:31:42,325
Next week, our customers will
be buying our scotch from them.

386
00:31:42,433 --> 00:31:46,233
In a month, I'll lose my distillers
toJoseph fucking Kennedy.

387
00:31:46,337 --> 00:31:49,204
And we'll all be
out of business!

388
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:54,769
We gotta get tough.
Yeah!

389
00:31:54,879 --> 00:31:58,337
Only, we can't
afford a war.

390
00:31:58,449 --> 00:32:02,283
They got armies;
we don't.

391
00:33:08,186 --> 00:33:10,051
Happy New Year,
honey.

392
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:14,921
Balls and brains. You got 'em,
you don't need an army.

393
00:33:16,594 --> 00:33:18,528
A hundred years ago,

394
00:33:18,629 --> 00:33:22,827
Austria was run by
a prince named Metternich.

395
00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:25,232
Austria was weak,
its neighbors strong,

396
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:27,896
but Metternich was
a cold, calculating fox.

397
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,065
<i>If one country
got too strong,</i>

398
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:32,540
<i>he organized
an alliance against it.</i>

399
00:33:32,643 --> 00:33:34,702
<i>He would bring Europe
to the brink of war,</i>

400
00:33:34,812 --> 00:33:39,749
then everybody thanked him
when he kept war from happening.

401
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:41,580
He barely
had an army?

402
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:45,087
<i>But he had Europe
by the kishkes.</i>

403
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:49,785
We gotta send a signal.
Nobody messes with our stuff.

404
00:33:49,894 --> 00:33:54,797
We have a shipment landing.
Cape May, tomorrow night.

405
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:59,563
<i>This is a perfect
opportunity to set a trap.</i>

406
00:34:45,983 --> 00:34:49,612
Aaah! Aaah!

407
00:34:52,356 --> 00:34:54,256
Cowards!

408
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:23,649
<i>Try this again,
I will kill your mothers,</i>

409
00:35:23,754 --> 00:35:27,281
fuck your sisters and turn
your brothers into eunuchs.

410
00:35:27,391 --> 00:35:30,758
I think you've made your
point, Benny. Let's go.

411
00:35:33,598 --> 00:35:38,934
Tony No Nose. Well, well,
this is a surprise.

412
00:35:40,671 --> 00:35:43,731
Give our regards
to Don Faranzano.

413
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:51,579
Who's next?

414
00:35:51,682 --> 00:35:54,617
You wanna start a war? I don't mind.

415
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:58,712
Well, I do. Sometimes you're
so stupid I can't stand it.

416
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:02,224
Let's go.
Move it. Move it.

417
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:16,629
I knew it. You had to
kill him, didn't you?

418
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:20,438
In 24 hours, Faranzano
comes after us. So?

419
00:36:20,545 --> 00:36:24,413
So? We can't fight him.
We ain't got the guns.

420
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:26,949
<i>Masseria does.
Masseria?</i>

421
00:36:27,051 --> 00:36:29,076
We're goin'
with Masseria?

422
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:31,348
He ain't so bad.

423
00:36:31,455 --> 00:36:33,446
He's a fat, stupid fuck!

424
00:36:33,558 --> 00:36:35,788
Other than that,
I guess he's swell.

425
00:36:35,893 --> 00:36:41,525
Frankie, right now, this fat stupid fuck can
save our lives. Remember, it's only temporary.

426
00:36:41,632 --> 00:36:45,898
A few more stupid moves like that,
they'll knock us over like bowling pins.

427
00:36:46,003 --> 00:36:48,904
It's time to play
with the big boys.

428
00:36:49,006 --> 00:36:54,205
Yeah, I used to be
skinny like you.

429
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:57,110
Hey, pay attention!

430
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:59,274
I'm talkin'
for a reason here.

431
00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:06,046
I used to move fast,
jump fast, dodge bullets.

432
00:37:06,157 --> 00:37:10,821
Fourteen! Fourteen
with my name on it.

433
00:37:10,928 --> 00:37:16,264
Yet, never a scratch
on this beautiful body.

434
00:37:16,367 --> 00:37:20,235
So I realized,
hey, I can't be hit.

435
00:37:20,338 --> 00:37:25,742
So, why be skinny? Eat!
That's what we are here for.

436
00:37:25,843 --> 00:37:31,645
- What are you here for?
- I wanna talk details.

437
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:37,847
Yeah, I hear
you got some trouble, huh?

438
00:37:37,955 --> 00:37:39,582
You hear wrong.

439
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:46,152
I hear you gotta join my family
to stay alive another 24 hours.

440
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:49,597
<i>I don't deal from weakness. Hey!</i>

441
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,691
You sit down.

442
00:37:55,406 --> 00:37:57,374
<i>I like you...</i>

443
00:37:57,475 --> 00:37:59,636
up to a point.

444
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:02,713
What are the details?

445
00:38:05,516 --> 00:38:11,011
I'm number two, above everybody.
Including Catania here.

446
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:13,647
We get a fain' piece
of all the action,

447
00:38:13,758 --> 00:38:17,159
and everything from me and my
associates goes into the pot.

448
00:38:17,261 --> 00:38:19,195
Everything.

449
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:23,757
Except whiskey. The booze
stays with us and Rothstein.

450
00:38:27,738 --> 00:38:34,166
So, my family
shares in everything,

451
00:38:34,278 --> 00:38:37,213
except...

452
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:39,408
The whiskey, huh?

453
00:38:39,517 --> 00:38:41,985
Right.

454
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:54,897
You suckin' bastard!

455
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:59,368
You son of a
flea-bitten bitch!

456
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:08,908
Thank God
I can't kill him now.

457
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:12,505
<i>He made such a tough deal.
He's no phony.</i>

458
00:39:12,616 --> 00:39:18,020
You and me together,
Faranzano is a dead man.

459
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:21,791
In six months,

460
00:39:21,892 --> 00:39:27,353
you pass
the whiskey to me,

461
00:39:27,465 --> 00:39:30,161
or I kill you.

462
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:39,734
You're part
of the family.

463
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:45,472
Ah, that's my boy.

464
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:51,578
It's not a question of numbers.
Anyone can rack up numbers.

465
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:54,852
It's how you do it.
It's a question of style.

466
00:39:54,959 --> 00:39:57,587
I don't kill with style? You
don't know how to kill at all.

467
00:39:57,695 --> 00:40:01,961
Gentlemen, sit down.

468
00:40:11,275 --> 00:40:14,335
Very interesting to
see you again, Mr. Coll.

469
00:40:14,445 --> 00:40:16,936
Again?

470
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:23,417
About three years ago, you
ambushed me and Meyer here.

471
00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:27,048
Oh, yeah.

472
00:40:27,158 --> 00:40:32,653
By the old way of doing things, I should
let Benny shoot you in the head now.

473
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:38,860
But I'm not
gonna do that.

474
00:40:38,969 --> 00:40:42,837
So, you're not
gonna kill me.

475
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,840
So?

476
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:50,213
- So, we have a problem.
- Name him. He's dead!

477
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:58,017
Our problem is you.
See, you freelance.

478
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:01,148
When you hit people on
our turf, it upsets the cops.

479
00:41:01,258 --> 00:41:02,850
No!

480
00:41:04,762 --> 00:41:07,526
Plus, you're very,
very good at what you do.

481
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:11,362
I figure, I upset somebody else,
you don't miss a second time.

482
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,300
That's my motto.

483
00:41:13,404 --> 00:41:15,736
Nothing so pretty as the
back of a mars head, huh?

484
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,011
What, you want Mad Dog
to go back to sellin' argyles?

485
00:41:27,117 --> 00:41:31,611
No, we want Mad Dog...

486
00:41:31,722 --> 00:41:34,088
to move
his operations out west.

487
00:41:34,191 --> 00:41:37,183
<i>Los Angeles,
San Francisco.</i>

488
00:41:37,294 --> 00:41:41,594
We promise to keep
you very, very busy.

489
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:44,759
Out west?

490
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:47,804
I'll think about it.

491
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:54,906
I'll let you know.

492
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:57,640
Gentlemen.

493
00:42:09,093 --> 00:42:13,587
Maybe we should just kill
him. No. He could be useful.

494
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:16,962
Let's just see if he
leaves town. Okay?

495
00:42:17,067 --> 00:42:19,297
Yeah.

496
00:42:19,403 --> 00:42:21,894
Yeah, sure.

497
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:25,499
<i>Gloria!
Hi!</i>

498
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:28,538
Hey, Mara.

499
00:42:28,646 --> 00:42:32,104
<i>Yeah? Could you come
out here for a minute?</i>

500
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:34,411
Sure.

501
00:42:37,588 --> 00:42:40,022
Hi.

502
00:42:40,124 --> 00:42:42,592
Let's go upstain's.

503
00:42:42,693 --> 00:42:46,493
Gambling doesn't start
till midnight. Okay? Okay.

504
00:42:46,597 --> 00:42:48,497
Come on.

505
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:59,099
Ah, I'm sorry I haven't been
in to see you. I had business.

506
00:42:59,209 --> 00:43:02,542
<i>It doesn't matter.
It doesn't?</i>

507
00:43:02,646 --> 00:43:06,173
No. I knew you'd be back.
You believe in fate?

508
00:43:06,283 --> 00:43:09,013
<i>I don't know.
I do.</i>

509
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:13,215
Some people are born to be
chorus girls and dog catchers,

510
00:43:13,324 --> 00:43:16,623
and other people,
people like you,

511
00:43:16,727 --> 00:43:19,992
have something they
don't even realize.

512
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:22,964
What don't
I realize?

513
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:27,401
I can't tell.
Wouldrt be fain'.

514
00:43:38,382 --> 00:43:42,785
There's another kind of fate.
Between two people.

515
00:43:42,886 --> 00:43:44,717
I mean,
why did I meet you?

516
00:43:44,822 --> 00:43:49,850
<i>You're very gentle, you know that? I am?</i>

517
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,190
Very.

518
00:43:54,498 --> 00:43:59,333
Most guys, tell 'em you want
to be friends and they skip town.

519
00:44:02,206 --> 00:44:05,937
But you really can,
can't you?

520
00:44:06,043 --> 00:44:10,207
Can what?
Be my friend.

521
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:13,147
I'd like to be.

522
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:31,533
I gotta ask you a question.
Not that I'm complaining,

523
00:44:31,635 --> 00:44:36,663
but if we're gonna be friends,
why did you kiss me?

524
00:44:36,774 --> 00:44:43,543
If somebody's your friend,
you can trust them, right?

525
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:47,413
With anything?
Yeah.

526
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:49,850
Yeah.

527
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:38,417
Do me a favor? I would
do anything for you.

528
00:46:38,529 --> 00:46:41,726
Don't forget
we're friends.

529
00:46:41,832 --> 00:46:46,166
Once you throw sex into the
kitty, guys forget thein' manners.

530
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:48,830
I won't
forget mine.

531
00:46:48,939 --> 00:46:54,104
Or they start getting all
goo-goo and talking about love.

532
00:46:54,211 --> 00:47:00,377
Love is a very confusing thing
which I personally do not understand.

533
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:03,851
Well,
neither do I.

534
00:47:10,961 --> 00:47:14,021
Can we do this again?
I gotta go to work.

535
00:47:14,131 --> 00:47:17,066
I don't mean right now,
I mean, um...

536
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:22,469
Sure. I can do it as often
as you can. Probably more.

537
00:47:22,573 --> 00:47:24,473
I'm sure.

538
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:32,747
I'll see you later. Okay.

539
00:47:39,323 --> 00:47:42,724
Don't fall asleep.

540
00:47:42,826 --> 00:47:45,317
I won't.

541
00:47:53,337 --> 00:47:58,138
Hey,
how's it going?

542
00:47:58,242 --> 00:48:01,700
Lansky's inside.
He is?

543
00:48:10,454 --> 00:48:12,547
Hey.

544
00:48:14,091 --> 00:48:16,150
What're you doin'?

545
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:19,593
Drinkin'.

546
00:48:19,696 --> 00:48:22,494
Straight?
Yeah.

547
00:48:23,033 --> 00:48:25,399
Beauty.

548
00:48:25,502 --> 00:48:29,836
I got a serious
question for you.

549
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:33,740
Ask away.

550
00:48:33,844 --> 00:48:35,778
You wanna
sleep with Anna?

551
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:40,645
<i>What?
My girl, Anna.</i>

552
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:43,515
I'm offering
her to you.

553
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:49,354
She's...
very beautiful, Meyer.

554
00:48:49,459 --> 00:48:53,020
I happen
to think this.

555
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:57,032
<i>But she's
not my type.</i>

556
00:48:57,134 --> 00:49:02,037
She's not your type?
Why isn't she your type?

557
00:49:02,139 --> 00:49:04,437
Because she's
your type.

558
00:49:04,541 --> 00:49:06,634
You're turning
down this offer?

559
00:49:06,743 --> 00:49:09,974
That's right.

560
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:13,481
I'm marrying her next week.
Or month.

561
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:16,484
We're not gonna rush it.
But I'm gonna marry her.

562
00:49:16,586 --> 00:49:19,555
Congratulations.

563
00:49:19,656 --> 00:49:22,557
Maybe you'll stop with all
these ridiculous questions.

564
00:49:22,659 --> 00:49:26,026
Friendships, Charlie,
they never get tested.

565
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:29,724
<i>You and me, if we're gonna
stay in this business,</i>
