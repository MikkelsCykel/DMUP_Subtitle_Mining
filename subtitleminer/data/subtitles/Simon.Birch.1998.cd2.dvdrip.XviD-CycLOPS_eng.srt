1
00:00:00,408 --> 00:00:04,003
We're not breaking anything!
Come on, please?

2
00:00:11,285 --> 00:00:14,083
- Ow, ow, ow.
- Did you get it?

3
00:00:15,156 --> 00:00:17,858
Ow! Got it! Oh!

4
00:00:23,029 --> 00:00:24,963
It's locked!
Now, let's go!

5
00:00:32,505 --> 00:00:35,872
- Are you crazy?
- I've got to know.

6
00:01:00,367 --> 00:01:03,734
Well, go on.

7
00:01:18,218 --> 00:01:22,314
Well, is it our ball?
Does it say "Tigers"?

8
00:01:22,389 --> 00:01:24,584
Come on, Joe.
What's it say?

9
00:01:31,765 --> 00:01:35,064
- It's-lt's not fair.
- Joe?

10
00:01:36,603 --> 00:01:38,366
- Joe!
- It's not fair!

11
00:01:49,282 --> 00:01:51,250
It's not fair.

12
00:02:28,254 --> 00:02:30,586
What the hell's
the matter with you boys?

13
00:02:30,657 --> 00:02:32,750
Baker fail you
in phys ed or something?

14
00:02:32,826 --> 00:02:35,761
- Simon didn't do anything.
This is all my fault.
- I helped you break in.

15
00:02:35,829 --> 00:02:37,956
- No, he didn't.
- You couldn't have done it without me.

16
00:02:38,031 --> 00:02:40,522
- Shut up, will ya?
- Nice try, Joe.

17
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:45,094
Now, the way that
I figure this,

18
00:02:45,171 --> 00:02:47,969
you can either do hard time
right here in prison,

19
00:02:49,509 --> 00:02:52,205
or you can do
community service.

20
00:02:52,278 --> 00:02:54,212
Community service.

21
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,214
That's what I thought.

22
00:02:56,282 --> 00:03:00,082
And I've already
called the reverend,
and he'd be just delighted...

23
00:03:00,153 --> 00:03:04,112
to have the two of you help him
with his Junior Lamb's Winter Retreat.

24
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:07,785
But that's over
Christmas break.

25
00:03:07,861 --> 00:03:10,887
Yeah, we don't want to babysit the
stupid third graders at some dumb camp.

26
00:03:10,964 --> 00:03:16,061
Fine! I'll just go out there in the
back room and get your prison uniforms.

27
00:03:16,136 --> 00:03:20,937
- Okay, okay! We'll do it.
- Good.

28
00:03:21,007 --> 00:03:23,567
Now, Joe. I'm gonna call your
grandmother to come and pick you up.

29
00:03:23,643 --> 00:03:27,875
- Oh, she doesn't drive.
- Well, I've got to have
somebody pick you two up.

30
00:03:27,947 --> 00:03:30,973
I've only got two men on tonight
and they're both out in the field.

31
00:03:31,051 --> 00:03:36,455
- What about my parents?
- Joe, do you have any other relatives?

32
00:03:36,523 --> 00:03:39,788
- No, sir.
- Did you call my parents?

33
00:03:39,859 --> 00:03:42,760
Yes, I did.

34
00:03:42,829 --> 00:03:45,559
What did they say?

35
00:03:45,632 --> 00:03:50,763
They said that...

36
00:03:50,837 --> 00:03:53,635
maybe that we should leave you
here for the night.

37
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:59,404
I guess they thought
it might teach you a lesson.

38
00:04:01,815 --> 00:04:06,184
Anyhow, I gotta get
you guys outta here.

39
00:04:06,252 --> 00:04:08,982
Do you know anybody that might come
down here at this hour of the night?

40
00:04:09,055 --> 00:04:12,320
- Yeah.
- Who?

41
00:04:12,392 --> 00:04:16,294
Yeah, who?

42
00:04:16,496 --> 00:04:21,126
Just about
to land in WGV. Let's click on
the turnstiles on our wax files.

43
00:04:21,201 --> 00:04:23,465
- Ben?
- Yeah?

44
00:04:23,536 --> 00:04:26,835
- Are you mad?
- No.

45
00:04:26,906 --> 00:04:28,840
Well, baffled,
but not mad.

46
00:04:28,908 --> 00:04:31,706
I assume you had a good reason
for doing what you did.

47
00:04:31,778 --> 00:04:34,474
- The reason is that Joe went psycho.
- Shut up, Simon.

48
00:04:34,547 --> 00:04:36,481
That's a good reason as any.

49
00:04:36,549 --> 00:04:38,483
- It is?
- Sure.

50
00:04:38,551 --> 00:04:41,611
Everyone's got to reserve
the right to go a little nuts
every now and then.

51
00:04:41,688 --> 00:04:44,714
- Life isn't always so easy.
- Or fair.

52
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:47,157
Oh, it's certainly not fair.

53
00:04:47,227 --> 00:04:49,161
Hey, you guys want to go get,

54
00:04:49,229 --> 00:04:51,754
uh, some pizza
or a hot dog or somethin'?

55
00:04:51,831 --> 00:04:55,198
- You want to take us for pizza?
- Yeah, it's 9:00. Aren't you hungry?

56
00:04:55,268 --> 00:04:58,032
It's not that.
It would be like...

57
00:04:58,104 --> 00:05:01,232
rewarding us
for bad behavior.

58
00:05:01,307 --> 00:05:03,867
- But if you really want to.
- No, Joe.

59
00:05:03,943 --> 00:05:06,673
It wouldn't be right
to take advantage of Ben like that.

60
00:05:06,746 --> 00:05:08,680
No pizza for us.

61
00:05:08,748 --> 00:05:11,216
Okay.

62
00:05:20,527 --> 00:05:22,461
Ice cream?

63
00:05:24,497 --> 00:05:27,227
So, now I don't know
if I'll ever find out who my father is.

64
00:05:29,802 --> 00:05:35,104
Maybe she figured
you weren't ready for the truth.

65
00:05:35,175 --> 00:05:37,040
Ben?

66
00:05:38,611 --> 00:05:40,738
Do you know the truth?

67
00:05:40,813 --> 00:05:45,477
No. I guess your mom was just
gonna tell me when she was ready.

68
00:05:48,988 --> 00:05:52,924
But if you did know,
would you tell me?

69
00:05:55,428 --> 00:05:57,658
Yeah.

70
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:00,164
Yes, I would.

71
00:06:00,233 --> 00:06:03,066
Ben?

72
00:06:03,136 --> 00:06:06,503
Did Miss Wenteworth
ever talk about me?

73
00:06:06,573 --> 00:06:08,507
All the time, Simon.

74
00:06:08,575 --> 00:06:10,634
Everybody talks about you.

75
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:12,735
That's how we keep
from gettin' bored.

76
00:06:12,812 --> 00:06:15,303
- Did she tell you about my destiny?
- Simon!

77
00:06:15,381 --> 00:06:17,406
What do you mean?

78
00:06:17,483 --> 00:06:19,576
- I'm going to be a hero.
- You are?

79
00:06:19,652 --> 00:06:22,780
Pretty vague job description,
isn't it?

80
00:06:22,855 --> 00:06:26,985
- How you gonna do that?
- I don't know.

81
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,994
I keep waiting for God
to show me a sign.

82
00:06:29,062 --> 00:06:31,963
Like the burning bush
in the Ten Commandments.

83
00:06:34,033 --> 00:06:37,434
But I guess he doesn't go in
for that kind of thing anymore.

84
00:06:37,503 --> 00:06:40,802
Well, uh, you know,
you got to be a little patient.

85
00:06:40,873 --> 00:06:45,037
I have been patient,
but I'm running out of time.

86
00:06:45,111 --> 00:06:49,605
Simon, you're
12 years old!

87
00:06:49,682 --> 00:06:51,616
You've got all the time
in the world!

88
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,880
I don't think so, Ben.

89
00:07:06,432 --> 00:07:11,369
<i>Time is a monster
that cannot be reasoned with.</i>

90
00:07:11,437 --> 00:07:15,271
<i>It responds like
a snail to our impatience.</i>

91
00:07:15,341 --> 00:07:19,778
<i>Then it races like a gazelle
when you can't catch your breath.</i>

92
00:07:19,846 --> 00:07:23,043
<i>Simon and I were in such a hurry
to get to the answers at the end...</i>

93
00:07:23,116 --> 00:07:26,347
<i>of the road that we never took time
to read the signs along the way.</i>

94
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:31,256
<i>How could we have known that everything
was working together for a reason?</i>

95
00:07:31,324 --> 00:07:33,724
And so I expect
each and every one of you...

96
00:07:33,793 --> 00:07:35,988
will lend a hand
in making this...

97
00:07:36,062 --> 00:07:38,826
the best Christmas
pageant ever.

98
00:07:41,901 --> 00:07:44,563
So, now, are there
any volunteers for roles,

99
00:07:44,637 --> 00:07:48,164
- or shall I just choose?
- Well, I'll play Joseph!

100
00:07:48,241 --> 00:07:50,209
Good for you, Eddie.

101
00:07:50,276 --> 00:07:53,074
- Looks like I got the lead.
- What lead?

102
00:07:53,146 --> 00:07:55,080
It's the Virgin Mary, Eddie.

103
00:07:55,148 --> 00:07:57,548
What does Joseph
have to do with anything?

104
00:07:57,617 --> 00:08:00,211
All right, now.
Any volunteers for Mary?

105
00:08:00,286 --> 00:08:03,050
Beautiful, beautiful
Mother Mary.

106
00:08:05,925 --> 00:08:08,485
Mary, Mary, Mary.

107
00:08:08,561 --> 00:08:10,495
Who will it be?

108
00:08:17,303 --> 00:08:19,237
Marjorie?

109
00:08:19,305 --> 00:08:21,796
Would you like to be
our Mary this year?

110
00:08:21,874 --> 00:08:25,275
- Yes, ma'am.
- Good girl!

111
00:08:27,347 --> 00:08:29,713
All right, now.
Which one of our...

112
00:08:29,782 --> 00:08:34,020
future stars
would like to be the Three Wise Men?

113
00:08:34,153 --> 00:08:36,121
Hm?

114
00:08:36,188 --> 00:08:38,554
Three Wise Men.
Who's it gonna be?

115
00:08:38,624 --> 00:08:40,558
All right.

116
00:08:40,626 --> 00:08:45,962
Gary, Allen, Matthew,
you will be the Wise Men.

117
00:08:46,032 --> 00:08:48,193
Now let's see what we've got.

118
00:08:48,267 --> 00:08:50,462
Ah, well, we've got
the shepherds,

119
00:08:50,536 --> 00:08:52,663
but they don't have
a lot to do.

120
00:08:52,738 --> 00:08:55,138
<i>Miss Leavey
always tried to downplay...</i>

121
00:08:55,207 --> 00:08:57,641
<i>the role of the shepherds,
but we weren't fooled.</i>

122
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:01,271
<i>We knew they were the plum roles
because all you had to do...</i>

123
00:09:01,347 --> 00:09:03,577
<i>was stand around with a staff
and try not to laugh...</i>

124
00:09:03,649 --> 00:09:06,174
<i>at the poor saps that got stuck
with the speaking parts.</i>

125
00:09:06,252 --> 00:09:08,516
All right.
Hands-Hands down. Hands down.

126
00:09:08,587 --> 00:09:12,648
Uh, Joe, Melanie,
Ming, Tommy.

127
00:09:12,725 --> 00:09:17,424
You will be
our shepherds.

128
00:09:17,496 --> 00:09:19,430
All right.
Now, let's see what's next.

129
00:09:19,498 --> 00:09:21,796
We've got...
Oh, the angel.

130
00:09:21,867 --> 00:09:23,801
Yes, the angel.

131
00:09:23,869 --> 00:09:27,930
The wonderful angel
of the Lord...

132
00:09:28,007 --> 00:09:32,637
suspended high, high above
everyone else...

133
00:09:32,711 --> 00:09:37,978
the wonderful, magnificent angel
of the Lord.

134
00:09:39,051 --> 00:09:40,985
Aww!

135
00:09:41,053 --> 00:09:43,487
- I can't! I'm afraid of heights!
- Well, then, this will be...

136
00:09:43,556 --> 00:09:45,490
the perfect chance
to face your fears.

137
00:09:45,558 --> 00:09:47,788
- Can't I be a donkey or somethin'?
- You're an angel.

138
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:50,954
You have your own special pillar
of light for all the world to see.

139
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:53,965
- Well, I'll switch with Howard.
- No!
- Yeah!

140
00:09:54,033 --> 00:09:55,830
- I could be Joseph. Joseph does nothing.
- Told ya.

141
00:09:55,901 --> 00:09:58,995
You are going to make
a wonderful angel, Howard.

142
00:09:59,071 --> 00:10:03,007
- But...
- Thank you.

143
00:10:03,075 --> 00:10:07,136
- Psycho.
- What about me?

144
00:10:07,213 --> 00:10:10,341
Well, Simon, you know what?

145
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:13,476
- You have the most important
role of all.
- No.

146
00:10:13,552 --> 00:10:16,112
Without you,
there would be no play.

147
00:10:16,188 --> 00:10:18,748
I'm not playing the baby Jesus,
so just forget it!

148
00:10:18,824 --> 00:10:21,554
- You're the only one
who fits into the manger.
- I won't do it!

149
00:10:21,627 --> 00:10:24,425
Come on, Simon.
It'll be fun.

150
00:10:35,074 --> 00:10:39,909
Easy! It says swaddling clothes.
Swaddle it!

151
00:10:39,979 --> 00:10:42,880
Simon, that is so cute!

152
00:10:42,948 --> 00:10:46,111
I look like a burn victim.

153
00:10:47,753 --> 00:10:50,620
- You made her laugh.
- She's laughing at me.

154
00:10:50,689 --> 00:10:52,919
What's the difference?
She likes you.

155
00:10:52,992 --> 00:10:55,756
Everyone likes
the swaddling baby Jesus.

156
00:10:55,828 --> 00:10:57,853
- It's great!
- You really like it? Well, thank you.

157
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:00,455
Why does Ming get
all the girls?

158
00:11:01,667 --> 00:11:03,601
But, uh, things
will be different...

159
00:11:03,669 --> 00:11:05,603
once God makes you
a hero, right, Simon?

160
00:11:12,611 --> 00:11:15,239
- Right?
- Huh?

161
00:11:15,314 --> 00:11:18,750
Oh, yeah.
I guess.

162
00:11:18,817 --> 00:11:22,548
You! You, you, you,
you, you, you! Okay, okay. Come on.

163
00:11:22,621 --> 00:11:25,249
So, is everybody ready
for dress rehearsal?

164
00:11:25,324 --> 00:11:27,485
- No.
- What now, Simon?

165
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,585
What are those?

166
00:11:29,662 --> 00:11:32,460
- They're turtledoves.
- They look like
they're from outer space.

167
00:11:32,531 --> 00:11:34,465
The audience won't know
what they are.

168
00:11:34,533 --> 00:11:37,991
They're doves, Simon!
The audience knows what a dove is!

169
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:41,437
They're giant doves!
They're as big as half a donkey!

170
00:11:41,507 --> 00:11:43,441
They're actually
kind of frightening!

171
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:48,208
Oh, look what I found
wandering off. A turtle.

172
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,714
Oh! A little turtledove! Look at that.

173
00:11:50,783 --> 00:11:54,048
Oh, so how's
the rehearsal going?

174
00:11:54,119 --> 00:11:59,182
Help. Please! I'm gonna strangle him.

175
00:11:59,258 --> 00:12:01,624
I swear to God! I'm gonna strangle
that little granite mouse...

176
00:12:01,694 --> 00:12:03,628
if it's the last thing I do,
with my bare hands!

177
00:12:03,696 --> 00:12:06,256
- I'm gonna strangle him!
I'm a little fragile right now.
- Simon.

178
00:12:26,185 --> 00:12:29,120
- Hey!
- You'll get these back
after the pageant.

179
00:12:29,188 --> 00:12:31,679
If you can stop yourself
from ruining our play.

180
00:12:31,757 --> 00:12:33,691
Understand?

181
00:12:38,097 --> 00:12:40,031
Any questions?

182
00:12:42,601 --> 00:12:45,069
Does God have
a plan for us?

183
00:12:50,409 --> 00:12:52,343
I like to think he does.

184
00:12:52,411 --> 00:12:56,245
Me too! I think God made me
the way I am for a reason.

185
00:12:56,315 --> 00:13:01,378
Well, I'm glad that, um,
that your faith, uh...

186
00:13:01,453 --> 00:13:04,581
helps you deal
with your, um,

187
00:13:04,657 --> 00:13:07,091
you know,
your-your condition.

188
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:09,491
That's not what I mean.

189
00:13:09,561 --> 00:13:12,359
I think I'm
God's instrument.

190
00:13:12,431 --> 00:13:15,229
That He's gonna use me
to carry out His plan.

191
00:13:15,301 --> 00:13:17,326
It's wonderful
to have faith, Simon,

192
00:13:17,403 --> 00:13:21,271
but, uh,
let's not overdo it.

193
00:13:36,655 --> 00:13:39,180
God's instrument.

194
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,924
Hey, kid. You okay?

195
00:13:49,001 --> 00:13:53,028
- Hey, kid.
- Hi. What's wrong?

196
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:57,737
My dad's makin' me go
on a retreat tomorrow.

197
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:01,610
- Why are you crying?
- I'm scared of all the other kids.

198
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,614
They're a lot
bigger than me.

199
00:14:03,682 --> 00:14:07,709
- Not all of them.
- Are you going too?

200
00:14:07,786 --> 00:14:10,687
And I'll make sure
nothing happens to you. I promise.

201
00:14:10,756 --> 00:14:14,089
Now get over there with those other
flying monkeys where you belong.

202
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:17,925
We're turtledoves.

203
00:14:17,996 --> 00:14:21,056
Quack. Quack.

204
00:14:21,133 --> 00:14:24,694
- You're good with him.
- Little kids always listen to me...

205
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:27,671
because of the way I look.

206
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:31,267
- Too bad Marjorie isn't six years old.
- Not funny!

207
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:34,536
The star of Bethlehem
is not a pinata.

208
00:14:34,613 --> 00:14:37,241
Marjorie! Marjorie!
You spit that gum out right now!

209
00:14:37,316 --> 00:14:39,250
The Virgin Mary
does not chew gum.

210
00:14:39,318 --> 00:14:42,014
Where are we going?
You get down from there!

211
00:14:42,087 --> 00:14:44,021
Get down from there now!
It's not safe!

212
00:14:44,089 --> 00:14:46,853
I've got half a donkey here.
What good is that gonna do me?

213
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:51,185
I need a cigarette.

214
00:14:52,264 --> 00:14:55,427
Monsters.

215
00:15:10,115 --> 00:15:12,049
Oh! Oh, hello, Agnes.

216
00:15:12,117 --> 00:15:15,644
Hello, Reverend. Hi.

217
00:15:15,721 --> 00:15:17,655
Ah, ready for tonight?

218
00:15:17,723 --> 00:15:19,657
Absolutely.

219
00:15:19,725 --> 00:15:22,285
# Joy to the world #

220
00:15:22,361 --> 00:15:25,728
# Miss Leavey's dead #

221
00:15:25,798 --> 00:15:28,494
# They guillotined her head #

222
00:15:28,567 --> 00:15:33,004
# We took it from her body #

223
00:15:33,071 --> 00:15:35,869
# And flushed it
down the potty #

224
00:15:35,941 --> 00:15:38,307
# And watched it go round and round #

225
00:15:38,377 --> 00:15:41,244
# And watched it go round and round #

226
00:15:41,313 --> 00:15:46,444
# And watched it go round and round
and never saw it go down #

227
00:15:46,518 --> 00:15:51,080
# Joy to the world
Miss Leavey's gone #

228
00:15:51,156 --> 00:15:54,990
- Oh, Agnes.
- Oh! Oh!

229
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:57,722
# She's buried
in the lawn #

230
00:16:19,986 --> 00:16:22,216
Psst! Psst!

231
00:16:23,614 --> 00:16:25,849
Thank you.

232
00:16:29,099 --> 00:16:30,259
Merry Christmas.

233
00:16:30,329 --> 00:16:32,643
Merry Christmas to you too.

234
00:16:33,232 --> 00:16:35,632
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

235
00:17:23,362 --> 00:17:24,311
Go, go.

236
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:27,375
Be not afraid.

237
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:34,208
For I bring you great joy.

238
00:18:34,287 --> 00:18:38,018
Be not afraid!

239
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:40,024
For... F...

240
00:18:40,092 --> 00:18:42,060
- For...
- Simon.

241
00:18:42,128 --> 00:18:44,255
Are you okay?

242
00:18:46,165 --> 00:18:49,657
For I bring you great...

243
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:53,336
joy!

244
00:18:53,406 --> 00:18:56,102
Oh, man! Oh, man!

245
00:18:57,861 --> 00:18:59,838
Oh, oh, man!

246
00:19:01,447 --> 00:19:04,678
Simon, what is it?

247
00:19:06,482 --> 00:19:07,878
Boobs!

248
00:19:10,756 --> 00:19:13,384
- Get her, Simon!
- Holy shit!

249
00:19:19,098 --> 00:19:22,033
Oh, shit!

250
00:19:23,202 --> 00:19:25,727
- Let go of me!
- I'm trying to help!

251
00:19:25,805 --> 00:19:28,569
Uuh!

252
00:19:28,641 --> 00:19:31,371
Ohh!

253
00:19:31,444 --> 00:19:34,106
- I don't feel so good.
- If you vomit on this stage,

254
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:36,273
I swear I will leave you
up there...

255
00:19:36,349 --> 00:19:38,874
- till next Christmas!
- Hold on!

256
00:19:38,951 --> 00:19:41,078
Uh-oh.

257
00:19:43,225 --> 00:19:44,589
Yeah, yeah! Get it!

258
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,953
I'm gonna kick your ass,
you little perv.

259
00:19:50,029 --> 00:19:52,020
Hey, leave him alone.
Pick on someone your own size.

260
00:19:52,098 --> 00:19:53,895
- Okay.
- Oh!

261
00:19:53,966 --> 00:19:56,491
- I told you this was a bad idea.
- Fight! Fight!

262
00:19:56,569 --> 00:19:59,299
Oh, shit!

263
00:19:59,372 --> 00:20:01,840
I'm gonna honk!

264
00:20:03,342 --> 00:20:07,005
- Oh, no.
- Simon!

265
00:20:13,185 --> 00:20:15,676
Oh, no!

266
00:20:35,908 --> 00:20:38,138
Can I get down now?

267
00:20:43,582 --> 00:20:45,607
Congratulations, Simon.

268
00:20:45,684 --> 00:20:49,586
You've just given us our first
full-contact Christmas pageant.

269
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:54,892
Well, do you have
anything to say?

270
00:20:56,595 --> 00:20:59,359
- Can I have my baseball cards back?
- No you may not!

271
00:21:03,135 --> 00:21:05,831
Oh, Simon.

272
00:21:05,905 --> 00:21:08,135
- What happened tonight?
- I don't know.

273
00:21:10,576 --> 00:21:12,806
Sex makes people crazy.

274
00:21:12,878 --> 00:21:17,747
That may be, uh... That may be true.

275
00:21:17,817 --> 00:21:20,945
But, uh, that is
no kind of answer.

276
00:21:22,221 --> 00:21:24,314
Simon,

277
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:27,382
you spend more time sitting
alone in a corner downstairs...

278
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,394
than you do
with the other children.

279
00:21:29,462 --> 00:21:33,558
You, uh, frighten them
with your stories...

280
00:21:33,632 --> 00:21:38,035
- about being an-an instrument of God.
- They're not stories.

281
00:21:38,103 --> 00:21:41,595
And you interrupt my sermons
and you refuse to apologize.

282
00:21:42,842 --> 00:21:44,833
I'm out of ideas, Simon.

283
00:21:46,245 --> 00:21:49,305
I can't speak
to your parents because,

284
00:21:49,381 --> 00:21:51,315
well, they don't
attend church.

285
00:21:51,383 --> 00:21:54,477
And I-I can't speak
to Rebecca because...

286
00:21:56,255 --> 00:21:58,189
because, uh...

287
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:01,824
um...

288
00:22:01,894 --> 00:22:04,488
Simon, what I'm trying
to say is that...

289
00:22:04,563 --> 00:22:07,623
all of us around here...

290
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,669
Well, we need a break from you.

291
00:22:10,736 --> 00:22:14,172
So, once this all simmers down,

292
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,199
and Marjorie Albright's father
accepts your apology,

293
00:22:18,277 --> 00:22:20,211
we'll talk about
you coming back.

294
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:23,214
- What about the retreat?
- Joe will go alone.

295
00:22:23,282 --> 00:22:26,740
And it's about time
I had a talk with him too.

296
00:22:26,819 --> 00:22:29,583
Simon, I'm sorry.

297
00:22:29,655 --> 00:22:32,419
but, as the Bible says,
"There is severe discipline...

298
00:22:32,491 --> 00:22:34,959
for him who forsakes the Way."

299
00:22:42,001 --> 00:22:45,027
"To impose a fine
on a righteous man is not good.

300
00:22:45,104 --> 00:22:47,629
To flog a noble man
is wrong."

301
00:22:47,706 --> 00:22:52,040
Proverb 17, Verse 26. That's, uh,
very good, Simon.

302
00:22:52,111 --> 00:22:56,343
But perhaps you know this one
as well: "Folly is bound up
in the heart of a child,

303
00:22:56,415 --> 00:22:59,282
but the rod of discipline
drives it far from him."

304
00:22:59,351 --> 00:23:03,082
- "Good sense makes a man slow to anger,
- Simon.

305
00:23:03,155 --> 00:23:07,148
- and it is glory
to overlook the offense."

306
00:23:08,827 --> 00:23:12,991
Simon... what do you
want me to do? Hmm?

307
00:23:13,065 --> 00:23:15,829
What do you want me to say?

308
00:23:15,901 --> 00:23:19,064
I want to know that
there's a reason for things.

309
00:23:19,138 --> 00:23:22,699
I used to be certain,
but now I'm not so sure.

310
00:23:22,775 --> 00:23:26,233
I want you to tell me
that God has a plan for me.

311
00:23:26,312 --> 00:23:28,507
A plan for all of us.

312
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:33,675
Please.

313
00:23:36,555 --> 00:23:38,580
Simon...

314
00:23:44,363 --> 00:23:46,297
I can't.

315
00:24:05,684 --> 00:24:08,653
Okay, you grabbed her boobs
and ya pulled her into the manger.

316
00:24:08,721 --> 00:24:10,848
Big deal. It could have
happened to anybody.

317
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:14,158
Well, maybe not anybody.

318
00:24:15,527 --> 00:24:17,722
Who cares what
Reverend Russell says, huh?

319
00:24:17,796 --> 00:24:19,798
Him and his wife, they're the two
most miserable people we know.

320
00:24:19,798 --> 00:24:20,730
Him and his wife, they're the two
most miserable people we know.

321
00:24:53,932 --> 00:24:56,992
- You okay?
- Yeah.

322
00:25:04,008 --> 00:25:05,942
Where are ya goin'?

323
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:08,535
- Home.
- Why?

324
00:25:08,613 --> 00:25:10,979
It's Christmas.

325
00:25:14,419 --> 00:25:16,353
I could go get the bike.

326
00:25:16,421 --> 00:25:20,084
I'll walk.

327
00:25:20,158 --> 00:25:23,525
Simon?

328
00:26:08,973 --> 00:26:10,907
Simon?

329
00:26:13,077 --> 00:26:15,011
Simon!

330
00:26:16,481 --> 00:26:19,177
Simon!

331
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:21,480
Simon's sick.

332
00:26:21,552 --> 00:26:26,319
- How sick?
- He's just sick, all right?

333
00:26:26,391 --> 00:26:28,951
But I've gotta see him
before I leave on the retreat.

334
00:26:29,027 --> 00:26:32,087
You can see him
when you get back.

335
00:26:32,163 --> 00:26:34,859
But can't I just come in
and see him for a couple seconds?

336
00:26:34,933 --> 00:26:36,867
Go on, now.

337
00:26:43,541 --> 00:26:45,475
Simon's sick.

338
00:26:45,543 --> 00:26:51,038
- I know.
- So was I when I heard
what he did last night.

339
00:26:51,115 --> 00:26:53,140
The whole town's
talkin' about it.

340
00:26:53,217 --> 00:26:55,151
What a little screwup.

341
00:26:59,357 --> 00:27:03,384
Hey! Your son is not a screwup.
He's a hero.

342
00:27:03,461 --> 00:27:06,396
What the hell
are you talking about?

343
00:27:06,464 --> 00:27:09,024
I said he's a hero.

344
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,660
And you don't deserve him.

345
00:27:11,736 --> 00:27:13,670
I want you to know that.

346
00:27:24,849 --> 00:27:27,443
... six, seven,

347
00:27:27,518 --> 00:27:30,783
eight, nine,

348
00:27:30,855 --> 00:27:34,484
- ten, eleven,
- Thank you. And God bless you.

349
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:37,084
twelve...

350
00:27:37,161 --> 00:27:39,095
Uh, is that it?

351
00:27:39,163 --> 00:27:42,496
- We're one short.
- Is that
supposed to be a joke?

352
00:27:46,504 --> 00:27:48,438
Have fun. Okay?

353
00:27:52,477 --> 00:27:55,412
- Please tell me you're coming.
- I just came to say good-bye.

354
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:58,040
But what are you
gonna do without me?

355
00:27:58,116 --> 00:28:02,883
Well, first, I'm gonna sneak
into Reverend Russell's office
and get my baseball cards back.

356
00:28:02,954 --> 00:28:06,185
Sounds like trouble.
Sorry I'm gonna miss it.

357
00:28:13,331 --> 00:28:15,993
Well, I bet you boys are going
to be very sad to know that...

358
00:28:16,067 --> 00:28:18,365
Miss Leavey has taken
a leave of absence.

359
00:28:23,441 --> 00:28:25,602
She's going to spend some time
with her mother in Connecticut.

360
00:28:25,676 --> 00:28:27,837
Okay, Joe. Let's go.

361
00:28:27,912 --> 00:28:31,609
Simon, you should be home resting.

362
00:28:35,686 --> 00:28:38,450
You better go.

363
00:28:39,524 --> 00:28:42,049
Yeah.

364
00:28:42,126 --> 00:28:45,562
- So, uh, I'll see ya
in a couple days, right?
- Sure.

365
00:28:59,177 --> 00:29:02,772
- Get better, okay?
- Okay.

366
00:29:26,104 --> 00:29:29,938
<i>I wish I could
remember every detail of that weekend.</i>

367
00:29:30,007 --> 00:29:35,445
<i>Even now, I'll sometimes sit
and try to remember the colors,
the sounds, the faces.</i>

368
00:29:35,513 --> 00:29:38,710
<i>But it only comes back to me
in bits and pieces.</i>

369
00:29:38,783 --> 00:29:42,719
<i>If only I had known,
I would have paid closer attention.</i>

370
00:29:42,787 --> 00:29:46,188
<i>But you're never prepared for
the moment that changes your life.</i>

371
00:29:53,965 --> 00:29:56,525
Whoa. Hey. Hey, you okay?

372
00:29:56,601 --> 00:29:59,331
Yeah.

373
00:29:59,403 --> 00:30:02,702
- Take it slow.
- You're very good with them, Joe.

374
00:30:02,773 --> 00:30:06,504
You should see Simon.
He's the one they really listen to.

375
00:30:06,577 --> 00:30:11,514
Don't tell me you miss him
already. It's only been one day.

376
00:30:11,582 --> 00:30:15,348
- He's my best friend.
- Yes, I know.

377
00:30:44,782 --> 00:30:46,716
Gotcha!

378
00:31:11,175 --> 00:31:13,973
- Miss Wenteworth.
And how did you end up...

379
00:31:14,045 --> 00:31:17,276
with Simon Birch
as your best friend?

380
00:31:17,348 --> 00:31:22,877
I don't know. Maybe it's because we both
know how it feels to be an outsider.

381
00:31:22,954 --> 00:31:27,118
Teased or...
whispered about.

382
00:31:27,191 --> 00:31:31,025
- They tease you?
- Yeah, you know, the Wenteworth bastard,

383
00:31:31,095 --> 00:31:32,960
and stuff like that.

384
00:31:37,468 --> 00:31:42,405
Well, people-people can be
very unforgiving at times, Joe, uh...

385
00:31:43,908 --> 00:31:45,842
I'm sorry.

386
00:31:49,847 --> 00:31:53,078
- Joe!
- Looks like somebody needs me.

387
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:56,313
Joe.

388
00:31:57,622 --> 00:32:01,422
You can talk to me...
anytime.

389
00:32:18,075 --> 00:32:20,839
God, no wonder
she kept it such a secret.

390
00:32:20,911 --> 00:32:23,539
You're sure we're doin'
the right thing, huh, Simon?

391
00:32:23,614 --> 00:32:25,775
We promised him, Ben.

392
00:32:26,661 --> 00:32:28,182
You promised him too, remember?

393
00:32:28,252 --> 00:32:30,345
You're right. I did.

394
00:32:40,264 --> 00:32:42,198
Reverend Russell?

395
00:32:46,203 --> 00:32:48,137
Reverend?

396
00:32:50,608 --> 00:32:54,169
Uh... I need the keys...

397
00:32:54,245 --> 00:32:56,179
to the kitchen.

398
00:32:59,116 --> 00:33:01,414
Reverend?

399
00:33:27,311 --> 00:33:30,178
A lefty.

400
00:33:30,247 --> 00:33:32,272
Just like me.

401
00:33:38,756 --> 00:33:41,088
What do you mean?

402
00:33:41,158 --> 00:33:46,460
I met your mother 13 years ago.
I was coming to Gravestown
to interview at the church.

403
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:49,931
- No.
- She was going to the city to
buy a present for her mother.

404
00:33:50,001 --> 00:33:52,435
Stop it.

405
00:33:52,503 --> 00:33:56,769
I'd never seen anyone like her, Joe.
And I fell in love.

406
00:33:56,841 --> 00:34:00,106
- Right there on
the Boston and Maine.
- Joe! Joe!

407
00:34:00,177 --> 00:34:02,805
Simon.

408
00:34:04,448 --> 00:34:06,746
Did you hear what he said?

409
00:34:10,921 --> 00:34:13,048
He's lying, right?

410
00:34:20,531 --> 00:34:22,726
Joe...

411
00:34:24,702 --> 00:34:26,636
Joe!

412
00:34:26,704 --> 00:34:28,638
Let him go, Reverend.

413
00:34:30,241 --> 00:34:32,106
Joe.

414
00:34:33,411 --> 00:34:34,991
Joe.

415
00:34:36,313 --> 00:34:38,838
A bastard.

416
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:43,147
I wish I never knew.

417
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:45,154
I wish I'd never found out.

418
00:34:47,658 --> 00:34:50,593
- I must sound like a baby, huh?
- No.

419
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:56,432
- Big goddamn baby.
- No, you don't.

420
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:03,936
- I wish I could go home again.
- I know.

421
00:35:04,008 --> 00:35:06,442
Back to the way things were.

422
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:08,603
I know, pal.

423
00:35:21,525 --> 00:35:23,925
I guess Simon's gonna ride
on the bus with Joe.

424
00:35:27,932 --> 00:35:30,662
- He'll be all right.
- Ben, it was a mistake.

425
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:37,136
I wanted to take care of her,
but she said she didn't need that.

426
00:35:39,009 --> 00:35:42,035
- Well, that sounds
a lot like Rebecca to me.
- Yeah.

427
00:35:43,314 --> 00:35:46,772
Haunts me every day
of my life.

428
00:35:46,851 --> 00:35:50,014
Wish I could take it back. l...

429
00:35:50,087 --> 00:35:52,920
I just wish it never happened.

430
00:35:55,126 --> 00:35:59,927
Well, there's a beautiful kid over there
who wouldn't be here if it hadn't.

431
00:36:07,771 --> 00:36:10,604
Ben?

432
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:19,013
... eleven,

433
00:36:20,117 --> 00:36:22,711
- twelve,
- and he ranks thirteen.

434
00:36:22,786 --> 00:36:26,222
- Hey, you came.
- I told you I'd be here. Come on.

435
00:36:30,936 --> 00:36:33,159
Up we go.

436
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:35,164
Thanks.

437
00:37:19,777 --> 00:37:22,610
You okay?

438
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,649
You okay?

439
00:37:30,287 --> 00:37:33,188
I was thinking.

440
00:37:33,257 --> 00:37:35,418
Maybe this was
your destiny.

441
00:37:37,027 --> 00:37:39,757
To help me find my father.

442
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:42,822
Yeah. Maybe.

443
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:07,186
...that our boys should be returning
home in just a matter of weeks.

444
00:38:07,258 --> 00:38:09,886
- Come on. Give it back.
- You started it!

445
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,326
Calm down, guys.

446
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:15,321
Watch out!

447
00:38:32,549 --> 00:38:34,642
Oh, God!

448
00:38:37,921 --> 00:38:42,483
- I can't... I can't stop it!
I can't stop it!
- Oh, good Lord.

449
00:38:56,774 --> 00:38:59,607
- Oh, no!
- Oh, my God!

450
00:38:59,677 --> 00:39:01,702
Oh, good Lord!

451
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,852
Oh!

452
00:39:19,797 --> 00:39:22,766
Reverend Russell!

453
00:39:22,833 --> 00:39:25,825
I can't sw- I can't swim!

454
00:39:31,709 --> 00:39:35,008
Hey, where are you going?
Come back.

455
00:39:35,079 --> 00:39:37,912
Okay, everybody, just stay calm.
Okay. We're going to get out of here.

456
00:39:37,981 --> 00:39:40,449
Hey, come on. Calm down.

457
00:39:57,301 --> 00:39:59,428
Just listen to me.

458
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,587
Stop it!

459
00:40:22,959 --> 00:40:27,589
I'm not going to let anything
happen to any of you. Understand?

460
00:40:42,378 --> 00:40:44,846
Now, the current is very strong.

461
00:40:44,914 --> 00:40:49,681
So I'll take you to Joe... one at
a time, and Joe will help you on shore.

462
00:40:49,752 --> 00:40:52,016
- Go!
- Okay.

463
00:41:01,698 --> 00:41:05,657
You first, now you.
You're after him.

464
00:41:10,607 --> 00:41:13,440
Don't worry. It'll be okay.

465
00:41:20,116 --> 00:41:22,676
I got you.

466
00:41:22,752 --> 00:41:25,550
Now, you. Come on.
Let's go. You're next.

467
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:33,893
Well, that's it. Come on.
Simon, let's go.

468
00:41:33,963 --> 00:41:35,897
Wait. We're missing one.

469
00:41:48,378 --> 00:41:51,074
Simon!

470
00:41:54,984 --> 00:41:57,578
Joe!

471
00:42:25,782 --> 00:42:27,909
My foot's stuck.
I'm scared.

472
00:42:27,984 --> 00:42:30,214
Hang on.

473
00:42:47,370 --> 00:42:50,601
- Aah!
- Come on. I got ya.

474
00:43:40,423 --> 00:43:42,357
Come on, Stuart.

475
00:43:45,028 --> 00:43:47,861
It's okay.

476
00:43:47,930 --> 00:43:50,023
I got him.

477
00:43:50,099 --> 00:43:52,158
- Where's Simon?
- He's inside. I'll get him.

478
00:43:52,235 --> 00:43:55,796
- No, no! Let me.
- Simon!

479
00:43:55,872 --> 00:43:58,432
Get him. Get him, Joe.

480
00:44:00,209 --> 00:44:03,042
Pull him through the window.

481
00:44:03,112 --> 00:44:05,546
Pull him out, Joe.

482
00:44:06,949 --> 00:44:11,010
- Joe!
- Simon!
- No, no, no, Simon!

483
00:44:11,087 --> 00:44:13,021
Simon!

484
00:44:14,257 --> 00:44:16,350
Let me.

485
00:44:19,529 --> 00:44:23,989
Simon!

486
00:44:24,067 --> 00:44:26,001
Joe!

487
00:44:33,810 --> 00:44:35,744
Simon!

488
00:44:42,452 --> 00:44:46,218
Simon!

489
00:44:46,289 --> 00:44:48,484
Okay, Joe.
Keep his head above the water.

490
00:44:55,565 --> 00:44:58,796
Hmm. Hmm.

491
00:45:09,479 --> 00:45:11,538
- Get 'em up to the road.
- What about Joe?

492
00:45:11,614 --> 00:45:13,946
We got him. Joe!

493
00:45:14,016 --> 00:45:16,348
Come with me, boys.

494
00:45:16,419 --> 00:45:20,515
Here. Down here.
Here. Hurry!

495
00:45:22,792 --> 00:45:25,192
Come on.

496
00:45:25,261 --> 00:45:27,229
Come here, children.

497
00:45:31,134 --> 00:45:32,999
Come on. Come on.

498
00:45:36,739 --> 00:45:38,730
Come on.

499
00:45:40,676 --> 00:45:42,803
Come on.

500
00:45:44,914 --> 00:45:46,848
Come on, Joe.

501
00:45:46,916 --> 00:45:48,884
Simon.

502
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:54,314
Don't leave me.

503
00:46:41,237 --> 00:46:44,138
I want to see Simon.

504
00:46:53,749 --> 00:46:55,683
Father Russell,

505
00:46:59,522 --> 00:47:01,456
I'll see you on Sunday.

506
00:47:29,752 --> 00:47:33,153
He's got a visitor.

507
00:47:33,222 --> 00:47:35,747
Simon...

508
00:47:35,825 --> 00:47:40,524
I heard what you did
for those kids.

509
00:47:40,596 --> 00:47:45,533
The whole town's
talking about it.

510
00:47:47,637 --> 00:47:51,971
I just wanted
you to know...

511
00:47:52,041 --> 00:47:56,341
that I think what you did...
was really brave.

512
00:48:13,262 --> 00:48:16,629
And you're a hero,

513
00:48:16,699 --> 00:48:18,633
Simon Birch.

514
00:49:03,213 --> 00:49:05,613
Jesus, Simon,

515
00:49:05,682 --> 00:49:07,616
you look like shit.

516
00:49:17,227 --> 00:49:19,161
Hey.

517
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:22,164
Hey.

518
00:49:22,232 --> 00:49:24,257
Are the kids okay?

519
00:49:24,334 --> 00:49:26,268
Yeah.

520
00:49:26,336 --> 00:49:28,270
They all made it?

521
00:49:28,338 --> 00:49:30,863
Even Stuart.

522
00:49:30,941 --> 00:49:35,378
Did you see how
the children listened to me...

523
00:49:35,445 --> 00:49:37,504
because of the way I looked?

524
00:49:37,581 --> 00:49:40,675
Yeah.

525
00:49:43,253 --> 00:49:45,380
That window
was just my size.

526
00:49:45,455 --> 00:49:47,389
Extra small.

527
00:49:47,457 --> 00:49:50,722
Extra, extra small.

528
00:49:54,031 --> 00:49:58,468
That was
over 200 Mississippi.

529
00:49:58,535 --> 00:50:02,403
Nobody likes a showoff.

530
00:50:02,472 --> 00:50:04,667
Promise me.

531
00:50:04,741 --> 00:50:07,335
Yeah.

532
00:50:07,411 --> 00:50:09,709
- You'll take my baseball cards.
- No.

533
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:13,546
Take them and share them
with Ben. Please?

534
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:20,656
Okay. I promise.

535
00:50:23,427 --> 00:50:25,361
Simon?

536
00:50:25,429 --> 00:50:29,365
Yeah.

537
00:50:29,433 --> 00:50:32,732
You're the best friend
I ever had.

538
00:50:32,803 --> 00:50:34,930
I know that, stupid.

539
00:50:38,742 --> 00:50:42,542
- Joe?
- Yeah.

540
00:50:42,613 --> 00:50:44,547
I got to go now.

541
00:50:47,351 --> 00:50:49,546
Okay.

542
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:52,384
See you later, alligator.

543
00:52:12,235 --> 00:52:14,294
Timber-r-r!

544
00:52:25,749 --> 00:52:28,047
One year good luck.

545
00:52:28,118 --> 00:52:30,143
<i>Winter left its icy chill behind.</i>

546
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:33,280
<i>And soon it was spring
and summer again.</i>

547
00:52:33,357 --> 00:52:35,291
<i>Grandmother passed away
that June...</i>

548
00:52:35,359 --> 00:52:37,293
<i>following a stroke.</i>

549
00:52:37,361 --> 00:52:40,853
<i>And because Hildie was always
so content to just follow her lead,</i>

550
00:52:40,931 --> 00:52:43,764
<i>she had a stroke of her own
and died in July.</i>

551
00:52:43,834 --> 00:52:46,132
<i>We buried them
side by side.</i>

552
00:52:46,203 --> 00:52:48,171
<i>It's the way
they would have wanted it.</i>

553
00:52:48,238 --> 00:52:50,172
<i>Ben Goodrich legally
adopted me...</i>

554
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:53,869
<i>just two days
before my 13th birthday.</i>

555
00:52:53,944 --> 00:52:58,381
<i>Not a day goes by that I don't
thank God for bringing him into my life.</i>

556
00:53:00,217 --> 00:53:04,244
<i>With Simon's help,
I'd finally found my real father.</i>

557
00:53:38,922 --> 00:53:41,823
<i>There is a prayer
I say for Simon Birch.</i>

558
00:53:41,892 --> 00:53:44,122
<i>It's the same prayer
that he said at my mother's grave...</i>

559
00:53:44,194 --> 00:53:48,324
<i>that night I found him
in the darkness.</i>

560
00:53:48,398 --> 00:53:51,731
Into paradise...

561
00:53:51,802 --> 00:53:55,795
may the angels lead you.

562
00:54:10,353 --> 00:54:12,287
Dad?

563
00:54:12,355 --> 00:54:14,949
Dad! I'd love to stay here
in the graveyard all day,

564
00:54:15,025 --> 00:54:16,959
but I've got a game, remember?

565
00:54:19,796 --> 00:54:22,264
Okay, Simon.
I'm coming.

566
00:54:22,332 --> 00:54:24,266
You know, I was just thinking
about that.

567
00:54:24,334 --> 00:54:26,268
Last year, you played
in the squirt league, right?

568
00:54:26,336 --> 00:54:29,430
- Yeah. So?
- This year you're a peewee.

569
00:54:29,506 --> 00:54:31,974
So, what do they want you to do,
play soccer or urinate?

570
00:54:34,211 --> 00:54:36,645
Anyway...
I was just thinking.
