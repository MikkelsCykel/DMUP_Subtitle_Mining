-l wanna go!
-lt's for grown-ups only.

22
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,221

34
00:02:36,355 --> 00:02:38,756

Okay?

36

They split up their children, house,
and their money.

39
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:51,287
They fight over eveything,
and whoever has the best lawyer wins.

00:12:54,407 --> 00:12:57,127

238
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:49,447
Why is eveybody saying that?

239
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:50,889
You are, that's why!

240
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:53,757
l haven't seen you look like this since
you and Teryfirst started dating.

241
00:13:53,865 --> 00:13:55,146

243
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:03,961
-What about the money thing?
-l tipped the man!

244
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:05,803
Why'd you have to give him so much?

245
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:07,278
l didn't give him that,,,
What are you talking about?

246
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:08,460
lt's my money, anyway,

247
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:11,468
You know you act like you're rich
because you're on N, you know that, right?

248
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:14,951
And did you really have to talk football
the whole waywith that guy?

249
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,461
This is the Bahamas!
They don't have football here.

250
00:14:17,557 --> 00:14:20,877
That man don't knowyou!
l mean, really, don't nobody know you.

251

As a matter of fact, do y'all know this guy?

l'Il give you $100 if you know him,

254
00:14:30,802 --> 00:14:34,803
Just because one ho at the airport
recognized you, you think you're famous.

255
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:36,507
You ain't famous.

256
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:40,162
What the hell are y'all standing here for?
Go put the bags up.

257
00:14:40,245 --> 00:14:41,726
Y'all didn't know him,
l ain't giving you no money.

258
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:43,328
You ain't getting a tip, either,

259
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,656
Ask herwhy eveybody at the airport
know who she is.

260
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:48,192
-You know what? Why don't you just,,,
-Hello, people?

261
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:49,721
-Say hi.
-You get on my...

262
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:51,216
Hi, guys!

263
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:53,484
-Hi! Finally!
-Come here, baby_

264
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:54,953
How you doing?

265
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:57,621
Hi! Hi, Shi-Shi!

Oh, man!

Look at this! This cabana is hot!
Now we're talking!

270
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,000
lt's not a cabana, baby, It's a beach house,

271
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:12,356
Beach houses are bigger than a cabana,

272
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:15,845
Oh, really? Okay.
How would you know what's bigger?

273
00:15:15,947 --> 00:15:18,148
What's that supposed to mean?

274
00:15:18,451 --> 00:15:19,971
Some times l wonder, why did l get married?

275
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:21,366
Why did l get married, too?

276
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:25,694
Marcus, the guys are getting changed,
and Troy's out on the Jet Ski.

277
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:27,112
Oh, yeah?

278
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:30,161

279
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:35,211
But l got to tell you, this is paradise,

280
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:36,741
Come on, let's go outto the beach,

281
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:40,069
Oh, no, Pattie! No, honey!

282

Come on, Pat! l came here to drink, okay?

283
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:46,049
Can you make some ofthose
famous margaritas, Pat?

284
00:15:46,144 --> 00:15:48,065
Margaritas. Margaritas,

285
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:50,387
Margarita! Yes!

286
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:51,563
Okey-dokey,

287
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:56,679
Oh, man! You dudes are crazy, man, crazy!

288
00:15:57,756 --> 00:15:59,037
l ain't never seen water that clear!

289
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,485
What are you talking about?

290
00:16:00,592 --> 00:16:02,753
-This your first time here?
-Yeah.

291
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:07,465
Man, l needed this break.

292
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,240
-Beer?
-Thanks.

293
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:14,135
You know, l've been watching your show,

294
00:16:15,006 --> 00:16:17,767
Thanks, brother. Yeah, You know...

295
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:22,737
Butfor evey good day l have atwork,
l've got to go home and go through hell.

296
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:25,149
-That's Angela,
-See, why?

297
00:16:25,283 --> 00:16:27,244
She hates the fact that l'm working,

298
00:16:27,352 --> 00:16:30,273
which is crazy, because she was the one
that was always on me

299
00:16:30,355 --> 00:16:31,916
about working and making money,

300
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:35,424
And now that l am, now she got
a problem with what l'm doing,

301
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:37,295
No, sir, l do not believe that.

302
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:40,430
There ain't no black woman complaining
about her man having a job.

303
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:41,773
l don't care what you say!

304
00:16:41,868 --> 00:16:43,628
-Are you kidding me, man?
-You met Angela,

305
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:46,263
Well, there's women,
and then there's Angela.

306
00:16:46,371 --> 00:16:49,452
You know some thing?
l think Angela's got a problem.

307
00:16:49,542 --> 00:16:51,942
-You think?
-You just figuring that out?

308
00:16:52,043 --> 00:16:53,764
Y'all should have seen her
in the airport, man,

309
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,366
l'm telling you, Troy,
it was the most insane thing.

310
00:16:56,481 --> 00:16:58,162
lt took us 45 minutes...

311
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:01,444
Oh, no, mo-and-a-half hours to let them
know that she wasn't a terrorist.

312
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:05,121
Well, the fact is, she was a terrorist,
But the point...

313
00:17:05,223 --> 00:17:08,624
She terrorizes your black ass,
that's what she does!

314
00:17:08,728 --> 00:17:10,888
No, no, l mean,,, Seriously,

315
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:14,624
l thin. Angela argues with me on purpose

316
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:17,341
just so we can have make-up sex later,

317
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,190
-What's wrong with that?
-Get out of here with that bull!

318
00:17:19,305 --> 00:17:20,545
-On purpose.
-Get out of here with that bull.

319
00:17:20,673 --> 00:17:22,193
No, l'm dead serious, l'm dead serious.

320
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:25,301
She enjoys being mad at me,

321
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:30,571
because later the sex isjust kind of crazy,
rough, but better.

322
00:17:30,682 --> 00:17:35,403
l bet your ghetto ass be like, ''Beat me,
daddy, punch this nipple, punch it!''

323
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,561
And?

324
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:38,543
He says, ''And''!

325
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:42,319
Let me tell you, l might be able
to help you with that, man,

326
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:45,908
You let me slap Dianne, Dianne would
knock the hell out of me, man!

327
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:48,032
She'd call the cops,
''What the hell wrong with you?''

328
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:49,207
You got to work her into that,

329
00:17:49,335 --> 00:17:52,055
-No, man! No, no, l'm telling you,
-You got to start out with this.

330
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:54,131
-No, no,
-Just a little bit...

331
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,880
Mywife is half-Asian,
she ain't having that, sory.

332
00:17:58,009 --> 00:18:02,010
The black half might have it,
but the Asian half would lock my ass up.

333
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:04,514
You know what l've figured out,
Afterall these years of being married,

334
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:09,177
l've searched and searched for reasons
and understanding of these women,

335
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:12,349
l got nothing. Nothing!

336
00:18:12,892 --> 00:18:15,452
You don't even have to look forthe
answers some times, and you'll find them.

337
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,721
So I don't necessarily agree with
Mr, Man over here.

338
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:21,518
So, how's it been with you, T?

339
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:24,754
You been crossing the goal line lately?

340
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:27,752
What are you talking about?

341
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:29,193
End zone?

342
00:18:31,242 --> 00:18:34,083
What the hell are you talking about, man?

343
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:39,769
Yes, man! Will you cut it out
with all the football talk, please?

344
00:18:39,884 --> 00:18:42,965
l don't know what the hell
you're saying most ofthe time!

345
00:18:43,088 --> 00:18:44,369
l'm still doing it?

346
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:45,537
Yes!

347
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:48,459
Y'all fellas are crazy, man,

348
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:51,954
Yeah, we all nuts, man, we all nuts,
Nuts to be married.

349
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:53,704
Like you and Sheila,
how's it going with you mo?

350
00:18:53,798 --> 00:18:55,919
Good, And the baby's good,

351
00:18:56,134 --> 00:19:00,575
Yeah, man, And itwas Mike that led us
to believe that Sheila couldn't conceive.

352
00:19:00,673 --> 00:19:02,633
That she couldn't have the baby,

353
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:03,902
And when all the while,

354
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:08,250
it was his players on the sideline,
not being able to make the draft.

355
00:19:08,681 --> 00:19:10,121
There you go again!

356
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:14,249
Marcus, are we gonna need an NFL
dictionay to hang with you this weekend?

357
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:19,153
Dude, will you cut it out?
You got to stop, man. You got to stop!

358
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:23,178
Look, l told Dianne, l said, ''Listen,
call Sheila, make sure she's straight.''

359
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:25,335
When 0ianne was pregnant
with our last baby, man,

360
00:19:25,463 --> 00:19:27,504
l was scared to come home!

361
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:31,414
l had this time when Patricia was pregnant,

362
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:35,858
I'd come home,
she's watching a dog food commercial

363
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:37,175
and starts cying,

364
00:19:37,308 --> 00:19:39,069
and then curses me out!

365
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,778
What's wrong with that? It's your fault,

366
00:19:41,881 --> 00:19:43,441
You don't get it?

367
00:19:43,548 --> 00:19:46,029
Don'tyou know all women are crazy?

368
00:19:47,118 --> 00:19:48,479
They ''mazy''!

369
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:49,954
Patricia doesn't even cuss!

370
00:19:50,056 --> 00:19:51,496
-Yeah, Well, you know what?
-Please.

371
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:54,504
There's sides of that woman
you've never seen, trust me,

372
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:55,667
l saw it.

373
00:19:55,795 --> 00:19:57,155
-When?
-College.

374
00:19:57,229 --> 00:19:59,629
Martina Jimenez,
you and her in the back seat.

375
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:01,932
-You told Patricia you was atwork,
-Oh, right.

376
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,714
l remember that!

377
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:05,664
Yeah, l remember that.

378
00:20:05,738 --> 00:20:07,458
l mean, she was worse than Angela,

379
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:08,820
No.

380
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:10,308
Ain't nobody worse than Angela,

381
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:12,649
Wait a minute, young man,
Whatyou tying to say?

00:20:12,744 --> 00:20:15,505
Hey, you're going to fit in right around here!

383
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,861

384
00:20:16,981 --> 00:20:19,062
She's out there, man,
She's some where else.

385
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:20,865
My little mumin?

386
00:20:22,153 --> 00:20:24,554
-Here you go, Pat,
-Thank you_

387
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:28,017
Okay. You know you start
all of my arguments,

388
00:20:28,094 --> 00:20:29,174
-Me?
-Yes!

389
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,501
Why?

390
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:34,156
-_our booh? He Cheated. So Now What?
-Okay.

391
00:20:34,232 --> 00:20:35,793
-Can l quote you?
-Please!

392
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,421
Y'all ready for this? Here we go,

393
00:20:38,938 --> 00:20:40,698
_'ln relationships, you must,,,
-Wait a minute!

394
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:42,973
_',,,respect each other's privacy,,,''
-l do not talk like that!

395
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,315
l don't sound like that, do l?

396
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:47,570
-Yes, you do! Yes, you do!
-No, l don't!

397
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,000
Let me tell you a little _ecret,

398
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,921
Okay, never mind!

399
00:20:51,282 --> 00:20:55,083
AII right, ''ln relationships,
you should trust each other's privacy.

400
00:20:55,221 --> 00:20:59,701
''Case in point, l don't have the password
to my husband's cell phone.

401
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:00,912
''l trust him.''

402
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:05,106
So, when l read that, l asked Marcus
forthe password to his cell phone!

403
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,911
Angela, why would you do that?

404
00:21:07,031 --> 00:21:08,512
Because you told me to!

405
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:09,881
How did l tell you to?

406
00:21:09,969 --> 00:21:12,369
Because you said that
you don't have the password

407
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:14,431
to his cell phone because you trust him,

408
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:18,460
So, l took thatto mean that
if l don't trust him, then l should have it!

409
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:22,266
-What?
-Angela!

410
00:21:22,413 --> 00:21:25,534
-What did he say?
-Girl, please, you know Marcus.

411
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:28,698
Evey time he lies, he says,
''Know what l'm saying?

412
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:31,788
''l lost it, you know what l'm saying?
l forgot it, you know what l'm saying?''

413
00:21:31,923 --> 00:21:34,564
l don't have Troy's, l trust that man,

414
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:37,247
l trust Tery, but l do have his,

415
00:21:37,328 --> 00:21:39,889
You have it? How?

416
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:42,419
He gave it to me,

417
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,261
What, you didn't have to do no tricks?

418
00:21:45,503 --> 00:21:47,664
What's going on in here?

419
00:21:48,007 --> 00:21:51,887
Oh, hell, no! Oh, hell, no, Mike!
What are you doing here?

420
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:54,577
l was hoping Marcus divorced your ass

421
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,720
and married a nicer, kinder, sexier woman.

422
00:21:57,817 --> 00:21:59,777
Mike, don't playwith me,
What are you doing here?

423
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,759
Look, l own part of a timeshare, l'm here

424
00:22:03,855 --> 00:22:06,016
This Negro got some neye!

425
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:07,605

426
00:22:07,692 --> 00:22:09,573
Now where are the fellas at?

427
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:11,062
Down on the Jet Skis.

428
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:13,323
Jet Skis, now that's a plan,

429
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:17,261

lt's called luggage. As in baggage,

433
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:31,601
As in when you look in the mirror,

00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,644
You are such a queen,

-Yeah,
-Did the women see you?

452
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:25,388
-Yeah, they saw me,
-What did they say?

453
00:23:25,503 --> 00:23:30,584
Angela said, ''Oh, hell, no, no!
Hell, no! What you gonna be...''

454
00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:33,350
She was patting her weave?

00:25:14,645 --> 00:25:16,366
We know, we know.

485
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:18,662
He's not staying,

486
00:25:18,784 --> 00:25:20,304
He can't stay, he can't,

487
00:25:20,385 --> 00:25:22,266
Tery, there is no way,

488
00:25:22,788 --> 00:25:27,428
Hey, you're a lamer, He paid his money,
we can't tell him that he can't be here,

489
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:29,646
-Maybe we should leave then,
-l'm with you.

490
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:32,608
No, guys, We spent our last to be here,
We're not leaving,

491
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:34,978
Guys, guys, come on.
Let's eveybody calm down.

492
00:25:35,067 --> 00:25:36,947
We're all adults here, right?

493
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:38,596
Sheila, we can ty to control him,

494
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:42,144
Yeah... No. We all remember Colorado
and the dinnertable, okay?

495
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,321
So, l don't know about controlling him,
but he's right,

496
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:46,210
We are adults, we can handle this,
Come on,

497
00:25:46,345 --> 00:25:49,945
We can run inter Ference
to keep Mike from scoring any points

498
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:52,209
against the opposing team,

499
00:25:53,251 --> 00:25:57,532
Marcus, whatthe hell are you
talking about, man?

500
00:25:58,089 --> 00:26:00,170
Sory, l've been hosting too long,

501
00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:02,699
Negro, you onlywork on the weekend.,

502
00:26:02,827 --> 00:26:04,668
You can't get nobody omthe 50-yard line

503
00:26:04,762 --> 00:26:08,563
'cause you can't get your little sliders
out ofthe dugout_

504
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,900
That doesn't make any sense at all!
What are you talking,,,

505
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:12,756
-Why you always gotta start?
-Hold on, you guys, Hold on!

506
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:16,071
Gavin's got a point.
We really need to be rational aboutthis.

507
00:26:16,208 --> 00:26:17,328
Rational?

508
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,809
Oh, no, No, no, no, no, Don't,..

509
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:22,539
My wife agrees with me,

510
00:26:22,948 --> 00:26:24,068
Rational.

511
00:26:24,182 --> 00:26:26,343
Y'all be rational, okay?

512
00:26:26,451 --> 00:26:29,412
But ifthis fool gets out of line,
l'm taking this straight to the streets_

513
00:26:29,555 --> 00:26:32,595
Y'all know l'm from Camden,
Got no time for ''rationaI_''

514
00:26:32,723 --> 00:26:35,884
You all be rational, she's gonna be ghetto,

515
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:40,841
All right, come on, let's go and unpack,
so we can finish having our discussion.

516
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:42,893
Come on, Marcus.

517
00:26:43,201 --> 00:26:45,002
0id shejust grab his nipple?

518
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:47,004
Probably,

519
00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:53,356
See what l mean? Make-up sex,

520
00:26:55,213 --> 00:26:58,014
-What'd he say?
-Don'twory about it, honey.

521
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:00,117
So, l guess he's staying,

522
00:27:00,885 --> 00:27:03,406
Okay, look,
we're not gonna give him any power.

523
00:27:03,489 --> 00:27:05,449
We are gonna enjoy ourselves,

524
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:08,031
and we're not gonna waste ourtime
even thinking about him,

525
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:10,647
-That's right, That's right,
-Okay_

526
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,210
A deal's a deal.

527
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:13,577
Sheila,

528
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,621
can l tal to you for a minute?

529
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:21,624
See? It's crazy that he's even here,

530
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:24,140
l cannot believe that Mike is...

531
00:27:25,076 --> 00:27:26,637
lt's so like him!

532
00:27:26,778 --> 00:27:28,538
l don't care nothing about that,

533
00:27:28,646 --> 00:27:30,567
Why'd you have to tell them that?

534
00:27:30,648 --> 00:27:33,089
-Say what?
-That we spent our last.

535
00:27:33,951 --> 00:27:35,992
l didn't think about it.

536
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:37,761
Baby, l don't want them to know that,

537
00:27:37,855 --> 00:27:40,496
Have you told them how hard it is
for us right now?

538
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:41,786
They're our friend_,

539
00:27:41,859 --> 00:27:43,820
They're your friends, all right?

540
00:27:43,929 --> 00:27:45,489
l barely know them,

541
00:27:45,631 --> 00:27:47,111
And l don't want them all in our business.

542
00:27:47,199 --> 00:27:49,319
l definitely don't want
that damn fool to know!

543
00:27:49,433 --> 00:27:51,434
l know you don't knowthem like l do, babe,

544
00:27:51,537 --> 00:27:53,457
But trust me, they're really good people,,,

545
00:27:53,538 --> 00:27:56,019
l don'twant them in our business.

546
00:27:59,478 --> 00:28:03,038
Okay, It won't happen again,

547
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:07,785
l'm serious.

548
00:28:09,288 --> 00:28:11,048
We are on vacation.

549
00:28:30,541 --> 00:28:32,142
Shoot, last time l was here,

550
00:28:32,243 --> 00:28:35,844
l caught a fish thatwas 13-feet long,

551
00:28:36,582 --> 00:28:39,182
-Yeah, we hearyou!
-We know whatyou're saying!

552
00:28:39,317 --> 00:28:42,278
l even had to have help bringing
that boy in, you know what l'm saying?

553
00:28:42,421 --> 00:28:44,901
l helped you, know what I'm saying?

554
00:28:46,525 --> 00:28:47,685
What?

555
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:49,346
Nothing, Marcus, Nothing,

556
00:28:49,428 --> 00:28:50,828
Why didn't Troy come?

557
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:51,889
What, you got to ask?

558
00:28:52,029 --> 00:28:54,590
You're sitting next
to our house guest over there,

559
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,500
so that's why the hell he didn't come!

560
00:28:56,602 --> 00:28:59,002
So, Mike, how'd you guys make out
in the market?

561
00:28:59,104 --> 00:29:02,664
My firm held, man,
But it was crazy seeing otherguys.

562
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:05,655
ln fact, one guy committed suicide,

563
00:29:05,743 --> 00:29:07,504
He was a trust fund baby,

564
00:29:07,578 --> 00:29:09,019
ln fact, l got to tell Sheila about that

565
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:10,914
'cause we had dinner with him
a couple times,

566
00:29:11,048 --> 00:29:13,209
and she always said he was unstable,

567
00:29:13,285 --> 00:29:16,365
That girl, l tell you,
she could always read people.

568
00:29:16,454 --> 00:29:17,695
Almost.

569
00:29:18,123 --> 00:29:19,523
Watch it.

570
00:29:19,625 --> 00:29:20,905
-We'rejust kidding around, baby,
-Watch it!

571
00:29:21,026 --> 00:29:22,386
l ain'tthat bad, so you need to stop,

572
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:24,007
Okay, No, you ain't that bad!

573
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:26,216
You're right, you're worse!

574
00:29:27,231 --> 00:29:29,992
Mike, why are you so sensitive?

575
00:29:31,803 --> 00:29:32,883
Sensitive.

576
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:36,531
What ever! What ever!
l don't care what y'all say, Sheila miss me.

577
00:29:36,607 --> 00:29:39,568
Look, we had some good times,
What, you don't think Sheila misses me?

578
00:29:39,644 --> 00:29:41,525
-No!
-Not at all?

579
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:44,533
-Like, no, not at all.
-Why are you asking?

580
00:29:44,615 --> 00:29:46,936
-Exactly, man, what does it matter?
-You know, l miss her,

581
00:29:47,051 --> 00:29:48,212
Say what?

582
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:50,600
Look, l miss her, o_ay? l miss her,

583
00:29:50,721 --> 00:29:53,042
Hold up a second, Mike, who are you?

584
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:54,885
l iust don't know what the hell
l was thinking letting her go.

585
00:29:54,992 --> 00:29:58,633
We came on vacation, we came to have
a good time. Don't start nothing, man,

586
00:29:58,763 --> 00:30:01,924
All right, l'm just looking back at my life,

587
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:03,828
When you look back at your life,

588
00:30:03,934 --> 00:30:06,455
you find that old girl that you dogged out

589
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:08,251
and you wish you knew then
what you know now,

590
00:30:08,339 --> 00:30:11,100
That's all, all right? Sheila's a good woman,

591
00:30:11,175 --> 00:30:12,416
You know _he'_ happily married,

592
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,831
Exactly, happily married,

593
00:30:13,944 --> 00:30:16,985
Does she talk to Dianne or to Pat about me?

594
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:18,755
She never talks about you, man, honestly,

595
00:30:18,849 --> 00:30:21,250
Sheila told Pat that she's happily married,

596
00:30:21,353 --> 00:30:22,713
Please fast fonNard that.

597
00:30:22,953 --> 00:30:27,114
Happily married, in spite ofthe fact
that he hasn't found a job yet.

598
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:28,592
-Troy's jobless?
-Why, why?

599
00:30:28,693 --> 00:30:29,654
-He got nojob?
-That's important!

600
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,121
-Don't tell him that!
-He don't got nojob?

601
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:32,783
What, he laying on the couch?
He's jobless?

602
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:36,144
No, he's notjobless, they just moved
from Colorado to Atlanta, right?

603
00:30:36,268 --> 00:30:37,588
So he's tying to find a job,

604
00:30:37,702 --> 00:30:38,663
-There's a dimerence_
-Fine, fine.

605
00:30:38,769 --> 00:30:40,410
Yo, we're about to kill all this.

606
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:42,265
Marcus, does Sheila talk to Angela
about me?

607
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,341
No, like, never.

608
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:47,291
l know you're lying,

609
00:30:47,378 --> 00:30:49,779
l'm not lying, l'm telling you the truth!
What you talking about lying?

610
00:30:49,847 --> 00:30:51,208
lf he was lying, you would know he's lying,

611
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:52,436
Hold on, hold on.

612
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:55,517
Wait, wait,
This how you find out if he's lying.

613
00:30:55,653 --> 00:30:57,454
-How big was that fish, again?
-What? Why?

614
00:30:57,556 --> 00:30:58,916
How big was the fish?

615
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:02,424
-Thirteen feet, know what I'm saying?
-There you have it.

616
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:04,367
Oh, wait, wait, wait!

617
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:08,190
And Sheila nevertalks to Angela about me?

618
00:31:08,299 --> 00:31:09,380
No.

619
00:31:10,568 --> 00:31:12,529
Know what l'm saying! It isn't happening,

620
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:17,653
Why would Mikejust show up like that?

621
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:19,863
'Cause he's a damn fool.

622
00:31:21,078 --> 00:31:24,479
Sometimes, when we haven't dealt with
things in our lives, they tend to show up.

623
00:31:24,583 --> 00:31:25,823
Yeah, but l dealt with that.

624
00:31:25,916 --> 00:31:28,037
How's Troy dealing with it?

625
00:31:28,487 --> 00:31:30,847
He's okay with Mike being here,

626
00:31:30,922 --> 00:31:34,162
but he got mad because l said
we spent our last.

627
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:37,040
-Yeah, l felt that,
-Was l wrong?

628
00:31:37,162 --> 00:31:39,522
-0id you spend your last?
-Yeah.

629
00:31:39,597 --> 00:31:40,838
Well, then you weren't wrong,

630
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:44,812
No, she wasn't wrong, but it is dimerent
than when you were married to Mike.

631
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,263
Oh, l know that.

632
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:49,491
This man has so much on his mind,
and he probably feels

633
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:51,854
really bad that he can't give you
what you're used to,

634
00:31:51,942 --> 00:31:54,503
But l never made him feel bad about that.

635
00:31:54,613 --> 00:31:56,373
l don't care about that stum, anyway,

636
00:31:56,515 --> 00:31:57,595
Yeah, but see, that doesn't matter.

637
00:31:57,715 --> 00:31:59,716
This is what he thinks
and the best thing foryou to do

638
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:02,251
is really tojustty to make him
feel at ease with the situation,

639
00:32:02,386 --> 00:32:03,867
l thought l was doing that,

640
00:32:03,954 --> 00:32:06,875
Child, please, all that man needs is a job,

641
00:32:07,392 --> 00:32:11,712
And then when he gets a job,
he's gonna start talking back to you

642
00:32:11,797 --> 00:32:13,837
and staying out late all the time,

643
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:16,692
and telling you how much
money he's making

644
00:32:16,801 --> 00:32:18,922
and how much he's making more than you,

645
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:24,397
and how he could be doing betterthan you
and how he's tired ofall your bull crap.

646
00:32:26,811 --> 00:32:29,452
-What?
-You sound so jealous!

647
00:32:30,414 --> 00:32:33,735
l'm notjealous! l just don't like hisjob!

648
00:32:33,818 --> 00:32:36,299
You dogged that man out
for not having ajob,

649
00:32:36,421 --> 00:32:39,021
then he got one
and now you're unhappy, What?

650
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:41,084
Youjustwanna be in control
ofthe relationship_

651
00:32:41,226 --> 00:32:44,146
And now that you feel that
you don't have so much control,

652
00:32:44,261 --> 00:32:46,742
you'rejust taking all your frustrations
out on the man, Angie.

653
00:32:46,832 --> 00:32:49,312
Pat, l am not tying to control this man,

654
00:32:49,433 --> 00:32:51,954
l don'twanna control him,
l just want him to do what l say_

655
00:32:52,069 --> 00:32:54,830
You see? There it is, right there!

656
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:58,740
Listen, when people tend to change
in relationships, it causes us to be afraid.

657
00:32:58,844 --> 00:33:02,404
And then we panic,
and that panic makes itworsen ourfears.

658
00:33:02,513 --> 00:33:04,634
So you have all the answers, don't you?

659
00:33:04,749 --> 00:33:06,589
No, l don't have all the answers,

660
00:33:06,684 --> 00:33:11,605
but l do suggest that you loosen up
yourgrip a little bit on the man,

661
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:12,770
You might see a dimerence,

662
00:33:12,857 --> 00:33:16,138
This is Marcus we are talking about,

663
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:19,861
I loosen up my grip,
he's gonna run like a wild dog.

664
00:33:19,964 --> 00:33:21,485
She might be right about that,

665
00:33:21,633 --> 00:33:24,433
But it is absolutely amazing to me

666
00:33:24,536 --> 00:33:27,296
how you can look at eveybody else
and see their problems,

667
00:33:27,439 --> 00:33:30,399
Angela, l'm a doctor, This is what l do,

668
00:33:31,108 --> 00:33:34,469
Yeah, Well, you know what?
l don't wanna talk about me anymore.

669
00:33:34,546 --> 00:33:38,946
Let me get a few drinks up in y'all
and then we'll see what's really going on.

670
00:33:39,049 --> 00:33:41,970
You know, you all act
like l'm the problem child.

671
00:33:42,053 --> 00:33:46,773
Matter of fact, bartender
can l get a few shots over here?

672
00:33:46,857 --> 00:33:48,858
-Yes, ma'am,
-We'II see!

673
00:33:53,498 --> 00:33:55,938
-,,,nice looking,
-l hope you look good over there, baby.

674
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,954
Baby, l hope you look good over there,

675
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:01,516
-We got next, Careful.
-Y'all need to stop talking across the board.

676
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,800
-They gonna lose,
-Who's winning?

677
00:34:04,075 --> 00:34:06,195
We are. We're about to win.

678
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:07,471
Okay, Marcus, what've you got?

679
00:34:07,546 --> 00:34:11,226
-l gotfive and a possible.
-Give us board, man.

680
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:12,669
Come on, baby,
you got to have more than that.

681
00:34:12,751 --> 00:34:14,071
No, l don't.

682
00:34:14,184 --> 00:34:16,905
l'm looking at at least three books
in your hand, right there, Sherim,

683
00:34:17,021 --> 00:34:18,062
Mike!

684
00:34:18,822 --> 00:34:22,223
What? The man ain't playing his hand,
that's all l'm saying,

685
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:29,343
l guess ifanybody knows what to do
with a good hand, itwould be you.

686
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:34,170
What? l like this guy, Sheila,

687
00:34:34,271 --> 00:34:37,352
Hey, you're quick on yourfeet, buddy!
That's right,

688
00:34:37,442 --> 00:34:38,522
Play your card, baby,

689
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:39,970
Don't rush me.

690
00:34:40,077 --> 00:34:43,038
Mike, why don'twe go take a walk?

691
00:34:45,449 --> 00:34:46,770
Why would we do that?

692
00:34:46,885 --> 00:34:49,205
Because you're a third wheel,

693
00:34:50,789 --> 00:34:52,109
Right,

694
00:34:52,958 --> 00:34:55,278
l'm enjoying myself, thank you,

695
00:34:55,393 --> 00:34:58,113
So, Troy, how's life in Atlanta?

696
00:35:01,132 --> 00:35:03,732
-Life is good, thank you,
-l was talking to him,

697
00:35:03,867 --> 00:35:06,908
-And she was talking to you,,,
-You know what? Angela, l got it.

698
00:35:07,038 --> 00:35:10,798
Life is good there, okay?

699
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:14,051
Please, let's play cards, Come on,

700
00:35:14,144 --> 00:35:16,305
He can't speak for himself?

701
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:19,855
When Sheila and l first moved there,
she was still in schooI

702
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:22,711
and l was looking for a job,
couldn't find one,

703
00:35:22,786 --> 00:35:25,307
ltwas rough, How's theiob search?

704
00:35:30,829 --> 00:35:32,109
What?

705
00:35:36,333 --> 00:35:37,494
Wow.

706
00:35:38,737 --> 00:35:41,057
Let me tell you something, my man,

707
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:44,899
l'm not the kind ofcat that's gonna sit here
and act like l like you, 'cause l don't,

708
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:46,976
Matter offact, l don't even like
the fact that you're here,

709
00:35:47,112 --> 00:35:50,272
But since you are here, do yourselfa favor,

710
00:35:50,347 --> 00:35:53,268
sit there, nurse your little fruitjuice

711
00:35:53,351 --> 00:35:55,751
and leave me and mine the hell alone.

712
00:35:55,853 --> 00:35:56,974
Cool?

713
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:01,310
All right, got that? Appreciate it,

714
00:36:15,005 --> 00:36:18,926
-Yeah,
-Yeah, l had enough. All right? l'm out.

715
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:22,946
-Whose phone is that?
-Goodness gracious.

716
00:36:23,047 --> 00:36:24,288
lsn't that your ring?

717
00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:26,462
Yeah, it's a voicemail,
It's probably the kids.

718
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:29,711
-Okay. l'll check it. Yeah. Be right back.
-lt's video or something, Can you check it?

719
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:33,621
Dianne can check the messages
of Tery's cell phone?

720
00:36:33,724 --> 00:36:36,365
Wow, So she has his password, too,

721
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:40,136
-Hey, you reneged.
-No, he didn't.

722
00:36:40,231 --> 00:36:43,111
Yes, he did, That's four books for us,
thank you vey much.

723
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,561
So we won!

724
00:36:45,737 --> 00:36:49,937
l'm just tired, know what l'm saying?
l got to get some sleep,

725
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,841
Wait a minute, Marcus, no!
That is not right,

726
00:36:51,976 --> 00:36:56,376
How you gonna just renege like that
and get all tired when we mention the..

727
00:36:56,481 --> 00:36:59,281
Tery, that's not right,
Marcus, how you gonna do that..

728
00:37:45,063 --> 00:37:48,383
Baby, you know l didn't say anything
to him, right?

729
00:37:51,034 --> 00:37:53,395
Think that make. me feel good?

730
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:00,957
l'm sory, babe,

731
00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:08,453
Look, l know you've been tying, l do,

732
00:38:10,822 --> 00:38:13,382
And we're gonna be all right, okay?

733
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:19,073
Just don't be mad, okay?
Come on, babe, don't be mad.

734
00:38:20,764 --> 00:38:23,325
l'm not. l iust wanna go to sleep,

735
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:36,111
Yep, l agree, l agree with that, Pat,

736
00:38:42,853 --> 00:38:44,494
Marcus, what you got to hide?

737
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:47,610
l don't know how manytimes
l got to tell you, nothing.

738
00:38:47,692 --> 00:38:49,252
Why don't you just drop it?

739
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:53,800
Because your name is spelled S-N-E-A-K-Y,
Sneaky.

740
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:57,346
Look, l'm not giving you my password,

741
00:38:57,467 --> 00:38:59,588
-Why?
-Because you ought to trust me.

742
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:03,431
Marcus, you remember Keisha?
And the penicillin shot?

743
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,135
Why the hell should l trust you?

744
00:39:06,376 --> 00:39:08,097
Baby, that's been over three years,

745
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:10,459
Have l given you any reason
to doubt me since?

746
00:39:10,547 --> 00:39:13,508
Yes, since you won't give me
the password to your cell phone!

747
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:18,519
Okay. The password to my cell phone

748
00:39:19,324 --> 00:39:24,204
is G-O, the numbermo, H-E-L-L.

749
00:39:31,001 --> 00:39:32,202
Babe.

750
00:39:32,903 --> 00:39:36,304
Did you notice that Pat and Gavin
were a little distant tonight?

751
00:39:36,373 --> 00:39:37,974
l really didn't notice that, no,

752
00:39:38,076 --> 00:39:39,356
l don't think you were paying attention,

753
00:39:39,476 --> 00:39:40,477
l noticed it.

754
00:39:40,577 --> 00:39:43,138
l spoke to her, she said they're doing great,

755
00:39:43,248 --> 00:39:47,008
That's Pat, honey, She's always...
They're always great, ''We're great!''

756
00:39:47,085 --> 00:39:48,645
You're right, She does say that a lot,

757
00:39:48,753 --> 00:39:50,793
Well, l'll talk to her.

758
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:55,062
Yeah, talk to her after you talk to me,

759
00:39:55,592 --> 00:39:59,233
You wanna talk to me?
You wanna talk to me. Will you do that?

760
00:39:59,364 --> 00:40:00,724
Phil.

761
00:40:05,436 --> 00:40:06,836
Who's Phil?

762
00:40:07,672 --> 00:40:10,672
You're funny, ''Who's Phil?''
No, l meant to say.

763
00:40:10,775 --> 00:40:14,815
What l was about to saywas,
l'm gonna go fill the tub

764
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:17,073
so we can take a bath.

765
00:40:19,016 --> 00:40:21,217
0o you wanna take a bath together?

766
00:40:23,621 --> 00:40:25,021
Yeah. Yeah, let's do that.

767
00:40:25,123 --> 00:40:26,243
Okay,

768
00:40:39,304 --> 00:40:40,624
l am not

769
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:45,200
going through
what l went through with Mike.

770
00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:47,590
l'm not gonna do thatwith you, all right?

771
00:40:48,413 --> 00:40:49,373
l ain't Mike.

772
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,440
Well, you know what?
You're sure acting like him.

773
00:40:51,581 --> 00:40:54,622
Not talking to me,
not touching me, not looking at me?

774
00:40:54,751 --> 00:40:57,032
You are putting me
in a bad head space, baby,

775
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:59,401
and it is not good, Trust me,

776
00:40:59,489 --> 00:41:01,890
-Can you please let this go?
-No.

777
00:41:01,992 --> 00:41:05,393
Now, l know l wanted us to move.

778
00:41:05,496 --> 00:41:07,256
But you agreed,

779
00:41:07,331 --> 00:41:11,252
And l know you haven't found a job,
butwe are in this together.

780
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,629
So we're gonna make it together, okay?

781
00:41:13,737 --> 00:41:15,418
l don't wanna talk about this right now,

782
00:41:15,606 --> 00:41:20,766
You know what? Ifthis is too much
foryou to deal with, go, Troy. Go!

783
00:41:20,911 --> 00:41:22,432
Because l'm not gonna do this with you,

784
00:41:22,512 --> 00:41:24,953
l'm not gonna do this with you
or anybody else, you got me?

785
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:28,243
What are you saying?
What the hell are you talking about?

786
00:41:28,353 --> 00:41:29,473
l'm not going anmhere, Sheila,

787
00:41:29,586 --> 00:41:32,427
Then why aren't you looking at me?
Why aren't you touching me?

788
00:41:32,523 --> 00:41:35,003
Why aren't you acting like my husband?

789
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:39,148
Goodness! l'm just tying,,,

790
00:41:41,331 --> 00:41:43,612
You know what? Let me find out
you're messing with some chick!

791
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:46,261
Look, l'm not talking to you
about this anymore

792
00:41:46,336 --> 00:41:48,017
because you're crazy,

793
00:41:48,606 --> 00:41:50,566
-l'm crazy?
-Yes.

794
00:41:50,942 --> 00:41:52,902
But eveytime we go to dinner,

795
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:55,771
you lay your cell phone
face-down on the table.

796
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,640
And then when you get text messages,

797
00:41:57,715 --> 00:42:00,275
you read them away from me
like you just did.

798
00:42:00,385 --> 00:42:02,665
And you come home late from work
all the time.

799
00:42:02,786 --> 00:42:05,627
l have late games, l'm in locker rooms late,

800
00:42:05,889 --> 00:42:09,650
You know what? Then them must be
some real feminine football players,

801
00:42:09,726 --> 00:42:11,847
'cause you come home
smelling like cheap pe_ume

802
00:42:11,963 --> 00:42:13,603
with lipstic. on your collar,

803
00:42:14,498 --> 00:42:17,979
You know what? l'm going to sleep,
Forget this.

804
00:42:18,068 --> 00:42:19,469
Marcus. No, you're not going to sleep,

805
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:22,050
l want the password to your cell phone,

806
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,801
Marcus, l want that password,

807
00:42:24,909 --> 00:42:28,309
Do you know that Dianne has
the password to Tery's cell phone?

808
00:42:28,413 --> 00:42:33,493
And Patricia, she even gives an acronym
in her book for trust,

809
00:42:33,583 --> 00:42:36,624
which is what evey relationship
needs in order to mahe it,

810
00:42:36,721 --> 00:42:39,321
and l'm tying to wor_ that tru_t,

811
00:42:39,423 --> 00:42:40,824
T, talk,

812
00:42:40,925 --> 00:42:43,725
communicate, which is what
l'm tying to do with you right now.

813
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:45,141
R, release,

814
00:42:45,228 --> 00:42:48,549
which means l should be cussing
your ass out about this cell phone.

815
00:42:48,666 --> 00:42:52,746
U is for understanding,
which means you should be understanding

816
00:42:52,869 --> 00:42:55,150
why l want the password
to your cell phone.

817
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:57,759
S is for submit, l ain't doing that,

818
00:42:58,108 --> 00:42:59,549
T stands fortalk to that bastard

819
00:42:59,677 --> 00:43:02,597
till he gives you
the damn cell phone number.

820
00:43:02,713 --> 00:43:04,833
Give me the password number
to yourcell phone, Marcus!

821
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:06,836
-You want it?
-Yes, give itto me, Marcus.

822
00:43:06,918 --> 00:43:07,918
-l know what you want,
-Give it to me,

823
00:43:08,052 --> 00:43:09,252
-You want it?
-Give it to me!

824
00:43:09,387 --> 00:43:10,707
-Yeah, l know what you want.
-Come on, Marcus!

825
00:43:10,788 --> 00:43:12,708
l want that password to that cell phone,

826
00:43:12,789 --> 00:43:14,830
Marcus, stop it! l want that password,

827
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:16,206

828
00:43:16,293 --> 00:43:19,054

Marcus, l want the password,

832
00:43:29,806 --> 00:43:31,287
Come here.

833
00:43:31,742 --> 00:43:34,702
Stop fighting me, Come here, Come here,

834
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:46,300
l don't think you understand
what this is like for a man like me.

835
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:50,185
l've always been able to provide,

836
00:43:51,963 --> 00:43:53,803
lt's been months.

837
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:59,207
And the money from the sale ofthe store,
it just ain't cutting it,

838
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:04,640
l'm just stressed, man,

839
00:44:07,277 --> 00:44:10,398
lt doesn't have anything
to do with you, okay?

840
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:14,121
l iust need some time, It's just,,,

841
00:44:14,418 --> 00:44:17,778
You have to communicate thatwith me.

842
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:22,471
l am not the same woman l used to be.

843
00:44:22,592 --> 00:44:27,993
l am not the kind of woman
that can deal with that disconnect.

844
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:30,666
Baby, the hardest thing in the world

845
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,961
is to have a good man
when you've had a bad one.

846
00:44:35,472 --> 00:44:38,273
l thin. it's harderto have a good woman

847
00:44:38,376 --> 00:44:40,256
after she's had a bad man.

848
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:42,344
Then when you punish me

849
00:44:43,213 --> 00:44:47,014
for loving you or wanting to talk to you,

850
00:44:49,219 --> 00:44:52,500
you make me wanna do something
worth the punishment.

851
00:44:54,224 --> 00:44:55,985
Can you feel me on that?

852
00:44:56,793 --> 00:44:58,514
l've been a bad boy,

853
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:02,017
l thin. l need to be punished,

854
00:45:02,733 --> 00:45:04,093
-What is the problem?
-l know people have problems.

855
00:45:04,202 --> 00:45:05,162
You can't understand me.

856
00:45:05,235 --> 00:45:06,996
l'm not gonna do this with you right now,

857
00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:08,831
No, listen to me,
You tell me what's the problem.

858
00:45:08,905 --> 00:45:10,626
Marcus and Angela,

859
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:14,336
l'm not gonna go through this,

860
00:45:15,012 --> 00:45:16,892
Sounds like Patricia.

861
00:45:17,681 --> 00:45:20,322
-l'Il go, babe,
-No, no, no. l'll go.

862
00:45:23,753 --> 00:45:25,514
Keep your voice down,

863
00:45:32,096 --> 00:45:35,256
Hey, Pat, Are you okay?

864
00:45:39,269 --> 00:45:40,390
l'm rine.

865
00:45:40,503 --> 00:45:43,224
0id l just hear you guys arguing in there?

866
00:45:44,275 --> 00:45:46,915
No, we're fine.

867
00:45:49,614 --> 00:45:50,974
Pat,

868
00:45:52,048 --> 00:45:55,969
you can't spend your entire life
just holding eveything inside,

869
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:58,047
Dianne, l know that.

870
00:45:58,188 --> 00:46:00,269
lf you know that, okay, well, then tell me,

871
00:46:00,391 --> 00:46:03,351
'Cause you never tell anybody
your problems.

872
00:46:05,762 --> 00:46:07,603
l'm fine, really,

873
00:46:10,101 --> 00:46:12,861
You wanna go get some warm milk
or something?

874
00:46:12,969 --> 00:46:14,490
No, but l was gonna go get some water,

875
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:16,365
-l'II go with you,
-No!

876
00:46:21,978 --> 00:46:26,699
Honey, you're gonna lose your mind
keeping all that stuff in,

877
00:46:27,918 --> 00:46:31,118
Please go back to bed, okay?

878
00:46:33,291 --> 00:46:34,971
We're fine.

879
00:47:13,963 --> 00:47:15,484
Good morning, Sheila,

880
00:47:19,103 --> 00:47:21,783
You know, there's staff that does that.

881
00:47:21,871 --> 00:47:23,672
lt's part of the package,

882
00:47:24,474 --> 00:47:26,155
Troy likes my cooking,

883
00:47:26,277 --> 00:47:29,517
Troy, l used to love your cooking,

884
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:34,441
Yeah. That's why l ate so much of it alone,

885
00:47:36,554 --> 00:47:37,994
How are you?

886
00:47:41,057 --> 00:47:42,458
Okay, Mike,

887
00:47:43,893 --> 00:47:46,374
What the hell are you doing here?

888
00:47:46,496 --> 00:47:48,857
Are you here tying to start some mess?

889
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:54,540
lfyou're tying to start some mess,
it's not gonna work, okay?

890
00:47:55,072 --> 00:47:58,392
l'm over it, and l am overyou,

891
00:48:00,577 --> 00:48:03,378
ls it really that easy to get over someone?

892
00:48:03,581 --> 00:48:06,461
Especially after all the time we shared?

893
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:13,060
Look, do you remember the night
we broke into the clothing store?

894
00:48:13,657 --> 00:48:17,697
ltwas storming out.
What were we, what, 18?

895
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:22,070
l remember you were scared to death,

896
00:48:22,766 --> 00:48:24,407
lt was fun.

897
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:29,203
But l remember you cried all the way home,

898
00:48:29,273 --> 00:48:31,233
'cause you thought
we were gonna get caught.

899
00:48:31,375 --> 00:48:34,015
ltwas the rirsttime we made love.

900
00:48:34,378 --> 00:48:36,098
lt was the best.

901
00:48:38,416 --> 00:48:40,336
l've been sitting at home,

902
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:43,018
thin_ing about all the good times we had,

903
00:48:45,623 --> 00:48:48,943
0o you remember the first apartment
we rented off of Auburn?

904
00:48:49,626 --> 00:48:51,787
The green carpet in the bedroom?

905
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:57,425
The out-of-date, pink tile in the bathroom?
Come on.

906
00:48:58,536 --> 00:49:00,496
And the kitchen, you loved the _itchen,

907
00:49:00,603 --> 00:49:02,524
You painted the kitchen orange,
remember that?

908
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:06,406
-lt was yellow,
-No, it was orange. It was orange.

909
00:49:06,476 --> 00:49:08,077
lt was yellow,

910
00:49:09,579 --> 00:49:11,860
l remember it because

911
00:49:14,083 --> 00:49:17,084
of that hole in the wall,

912
00:49:17,221 --> 00:49:19,741
the one when you pushed me into it,

913
00:49:20,391 --> 00:49:24,791
And l remember the pink tile,
My nose bled on it.

914
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:29,090
And forthe life of me, l couldn't...

915
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,960
l couldn't get that blood up,

916
00:49:32,936 --> 00:49:35,297
And l remember the bedroom.

917
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:38,640
ltwas cold,

918
00:49:40,443 --> 00:49:41,964
vey cold,

919
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:45,627
And there was no light,

920
00:49:45,748 --> 00:49:46,909
None.

921
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:51,458
And l was so depressed,

922
00:49:55,358 --> 00:49:58,279
That's what l remember
about that apartment.

923
00:50:07,704 --> 00:50:09,585
-Look, Sheila,,,
-Hey!

924
00:50:10,373 --> 00:50:14,134
l don't know what came over me, okay?
Just,,, l was a fool.

925
00:50:15,278 --> 00:50:18,119
l am so sory. And, look, l miss you,,,

926
00:50:18,215 --> 00:50:20,375
Please, stop!

927
00:50:20,483 --> 00:50:21,804
You are my past,

928
00:50:21,885 --> 00:50:24,206
and there ain't no future in it, okay?

929
00:50:25,556 --> 00:50:27,036
l know.

930
00:50:29,226 --> 00:50:31,986
Get your ass out ofthis kitchen, Go!

931
00:50:58,822 --> 00:51:03,502
Hi, you guys! Oh, God,
The water is so warm out there.

932
00:51:03,594 --> 00:51:05,114
l feel so relaxed.

933
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:07,669
-Could you stay that way?
-l'll try

934
00:51:07,764 --> 00:51:09,525
Come in, it's so warm out there.

935
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:12,160
Nope, l've already been in,
l'm not getting wet again,

936
00:51:12,268 --> 00:51:14,229
-Come on, Dianne!
-A little later.

937
00:51:18,108 --> 00:51:19,188
What is this?

938
00:51:19,275 --> 00:51:21,836
l'm so sory, it's the wind,
The wind just took it away.

939
00:51:21,945 --> 00:51:25,146
0id the voodoo king and queen
drop chicken dust in my hair?

940
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:27,409
-Angela!
-No, what is this?

941
00:51:27,518 --> 00:51:30,558
What did y'all just do?
Did you just put a spell on me?

942
00:51:30,688 --> 00:51:32,688
No, we had a friend
who just recently passed.

943
00:51:32,789 --> 00:51:33,870
-What
-This wind,

944
00:51:33,958 --> 00:51:36,078
it's a little unpredictable here, l'm so sory,

945
00:51:36,193 --> 00:51:39,273
Please forgive us, butthese are her ashes,

946
00:51:44,268 --> 00:51:46,708
-Calm down, Angela,
-Angela, relax!

947
00:51:46,804 --> 00:51:48,084
Just relax!

948
00:51:48,204 --> 00:51:49,965
Calm down, Angela!

949
00:51:53,476 --> 00:51:54,717
ls there anything we can do?

950
00:51:54,811 --> 00:51:57,612
Just ignore her, She'll be totallyfine!

951
00:51:59,115 --> 00:52:02,076
That's befitting, 'cause our friend
was equally as dramatic!

952
00:52:02,219 --> 00:52:05,379
Her name was Bertha Monroe,
ifthat gives you any clue_

953
00:52:05,489 --> 00:52:08,249
And she was a character
just as animated as your friend.

954
00:52:08,391 --> 00:52:11,152
-How long ago did she pass?
-A week.

955
00:52:11,427 --> 00:52:13,108
l'm sory to hearthat,

956
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:14,230
How old was she?

957
00:52:14,331 --> 00:52:15,731
l don't know, she'd nevertell us.

958
00:52:15,833 --> 00:52:18,633
Well, she nevertold us the truth,
Some where bemeen 28 and 80.

959
00:52:20,003 --> 00:52:21,884
l'm so sory, l'm Patricia Agnew,

960
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:24,092
-Hello
-Hi, Dianne Bob.

961
00:52:24,173 --> 00:52:25,134
Hi, Sheila.

962
00:52:25,275 --> 00:52:28,435
All right, my name is Porter Jones,
and this is mywife, Ola.

963
00:52:28,512 --> 00:52:29,952
-Nice to meet you.
-Hi.

964
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:31,560
And once again, forgive us, we're sory,

965
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:35,049
We're just going down the beach
to get a seat for the fireworks tonight.

966
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:36,592
Fireworks!

967
00:52:36,686 --> 00:52:38,927
lt's the annual carnival,
You got a great view here.

968
00:52:39,023 --> 00:52:39,983
Wait,,.

969
00:52:40,123 --> 00:52:41,284
-We should invite them to dinner,
-Yes.

970
00:52:41,358 --> 00:52:43,318
Mr, and Mrs, Jones
would you join us for dinner?

971
00:52:43,427 --> 00:52:44,947
Yeah, it's our last night here,

972
00:52:45,028 --> 00:52:47,589
lt's when we share our
''Why did l get married'' stories.

973
00:52:47,697 --> 00:52:51,138
lt would only be befitting
if you would join us.

974
00:52:51,268 --> 00:52:52,948
We would absolutely love it,

975
00:52:53,369 --> 00:52:56,290
l don't thin. eveybody would love it,

976
00:53:03,514 --> 00:53:06,674
Fourteen years, we're still in love,
Two beautiful kids.

977
00:53:07,384 --> 00:53:09,344
Life is good,

978
00:53:10,186 --> 00:53:12,987
And l knew that l didn't wanna

979
00:53:13,123 --> 00:53:15,643
spend the rest of my life
with out this woman.

980
00:53:17,226 --> 00:53:19,707
So I married her.

981
00:53:20,731 --> 00:53:23,291
And l'm so glad l did,
l wouldn't change a thing.

982
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:26,301
You are so sweet,
You know l love you, right?

983
00:53:26,402 --> 00:53:27,763
l love you, too, baby,

984
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:31,300
Wait_ Watch your _tep,

985
00:53:31,407 --> 00:53:34,888
Sheila, Troy, your turn,

986
00:53:35,978 --> 00:53:37,299
Yes.

987
00:53:37,715 --> 00:53:39,875
Okay, l can't hold that,

988
00:53:42,485 --> 00:53:45,046
Here we go. We're alway. up,

989
00:53:46,757 --> 00:53:50,997
Why l got married is simple,
'Cause l love this woman.

990
00:53:51,427 --> 00:53:52,988
Behind her eyes was

991
00:53:53,097 --> 00:53:56,897
so much pain and truth and love

992
00:53:57,867 --> 00:54:01,428
that l wanted to help her, heal her,

993
00:54:02,106 --> 00:54:03,906
l wanted to be her hero.

994
00:54:06,175 --> 00:54:08,416
Little did l know that

995
00:54:10,047 --> 00:54:13,247
she'd be all that for me, and then some.

996
00:54:13,382 --> 00:54:15,343
She's my queen,

997
00:54:15,952 --> 00:54:18,193
Why did l get married?

998
00:54:18,621 --> 00:54:21,382
When l met Troy, it was his eyes,

999
00:54:21,525 --> 00:54:26,085
They said that l could mary him,
and that l could trust him.

1000
00:54:26,563 --> 00:54:30,043
l needed to trust and to love

1001
00:54:30,134 --> 00:54:33,014
because l've been through a lot of pain

1002
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:36,703
in my past relationship and in my life,

1003
00:54:36,806 --> 00:54:41,007
l believed that there had to be an opposite

1004
00:54:42,478 --> 00:54:44,879
to the misey, the loneliness,

1005
00:54:44,981 --> 00:54:47,782
and l found that exact opposite

1006
00:54:48,385 --> 00:54:50,145
in this man.

1007
00:54:53,322 --> 00:54:55,483
Marcus, Angela?

1008
00:54:55,592 --> 00:54:56,552
l pass,

1009
00:54:56,659 --> 00:54:58,060
Y'all know she ain't got
nothing positive to say,

1010
00:54:58,161 --> 00:54:59,242
All right, you mo, stop!

1011
00:54:59,329 --> 00:55:01,409
Why don't you leave me a message,

1012
00:55:01,498 --> 00:55:04,458
and l'll check it
once l get a password, okay?

1013
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:06,215
How about that?

1014
00:55:06,302 --> 00:55:07,943
Here we go,

1015
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:12,901
Pat and Gavin, you wanna go?

1016
00:55:17,481 --> 00:55:20,441
l think we should allow
our guests to go first,

1017
00:55:20,516 --> 00:55:23,677
l agree with what she said, yeah,

1018
00:55:25,755 --> 00:55:27,076
So be it.

1019
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:30,471
AIl you do is go up
and you say why you got married.

1020
00:55:32,295 --> 00:55:33,336
Okay,

1021
00:55:34,931 --> 00:55:37,092
lt's been so long,
l don't think l can remember.

1022
00:55:37,201 --> 00:55:38,681
Oh, stop it,

1023
00:55:39,436 --> 00:55:41,596
Mademoiselle, please,

1024
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:44,972
l didn't know we was gonna be on exhibit,

1025
00:55:50,447 --> 00:55:52,127
We've been married 53 years, right?

1026
00:55:52,215 --> 00:55:53,936
-Fifty-five,
-Fifty-five?

1027
00:55:54,016 --> 00:55:55,137
Yes.

1028
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:59,000
l just said that to see
if she would remember.

1029
00:55:59,121 --> 00:56:00,282
Right,

1030
00:56:01,724 --> 00:56:06,525
l married this sweet little soul
when l was 2 years old.

1031
00:56:07,898 --> 00:56:09,858
She was the only woman for me,

1032
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,120
That's not how l remember it.

1033
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:19,472
He asked me to wait because
he was going omto the war. l did.

1034
00:56:21,344 --> 00:56:26,385
And when he came back home,
l just knew thatwe were gonna mary.

1035
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:30,904
But he wanted Edna Rankins.

1036
00:56:31,021 --> 00:56:33,181
No, let bygones be bygones,

1037
00:56:33,322 --> 00:56:35,123
-l'm gonna spill it,
-No!

1038
00:56:35,858 --> 00:56:38,419
He married this little hussy, you see?

1039
00:56:38,527 --> 00:56:40,968
And in three years time, she run off,

1040
00:56:44,101 --> 00:56:47,421
-So you waited for him,
-l did not.

1041
00:56:48,505 --> 00:56:51,425
l married Washington Freeman,

1042
00:56:52,009 --> 00:56:54,849
He was the countriest man l ever met.

1043
00:56:54,945 --> 00:56:56,545
-Three times her age,
-Stop it.

1044
00:56:56,679 --> 00:56:59,840
He was so old,
his social security numberwas three.

1045
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:01,157
Shut up!

1046
00:57:04,454 --> 00:57:06,094
He worked in the fields, with the cows.

1047
00:57:06,222 --> 00:57:07,383
He always smelled like cow chips,

1048
00:57:07,523 --> 00:57:08,724
Just stop it,

1049
00:57:11,128 --> 00:57:14,928
Well, his marriage ended
when she ran omwith the milkman.

1050
00:57:15,264 --> 00:57:17,625
Literally! The milkman!

1051
00:57:17,733 --> 00:57:20,174
Leaving him with mo children to raise,

1052
00:57:20,637 --> 00:57:22,717
You know, l wentto the market one day,

1053
00:57:22,806 --> 00:57:25,926
and l saw him there
wrestling with these children.

1054
00:57:26,043 --> 00:57:29,883
-l laughed so hard! He got mad at me!
-Yeah,

1055
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:31,260
She was vey rude!

1056
00:57:31,648 --> 00:57:34,408
There l am, tying to get the children
in the car, she's over there laughing!

1057
00:57:34,483 --> 00:57:36,044
l said to him,

1058
00:57:36,152 --> 00:57:38,953
''The grass wasn't so green after all!''

1059
00:57:39,623 --> 00:57:41,263
l swore that l would never
speak to her again.

1060
00:57:41,391 --> 00:57:43,791
Of course, you know, l did,

1061
00:57:44,561 --> 00:57:48,321
Next winter, Washington took ill,

1062
00:57:49,498 --> 00:57:52,299
By the summer,
he could barely get out of bed.

1063
00:57:53,503 --> 00:57:54,983
l buried him,

1064
00:57:55,105 --> 00:58:00,105
and then we had to leave the farm
because we didn't own it,

1065
00:58:01,177 --> 00:58:04,818
l went to church, and l prayed fora miracle,

1066
00:58:06,148 --> 00:58:10,309
a place for me
and my three children to stay.

1067
00:58:12,688 --> 00:58:16,649
l looked up and l saw an angel!

1068
00:58:18,327 --> 00:58:22,728
ltwas the finest,
most hand some man l ever saw.

1069
00:58:24,867 --> 00:58:26,028
He said,

1070
00:58:27,371 --> 00:58:29,931
''Hello, Ola,''

1071
00:58:30,974 --> 00:58:32,734
lt was him.

1072
00:58:34,378 --> 00:58:36,778
ltwas the way he said my name,

1073
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:42,034
lt was the kindest, sweetest

1074
00:58:42,885 --> 00:58:46,926
sound l had ever heard.

1075
00:58:47,657 --> 00:58:49,777
And l knew then

1076
00:58:50,726 --> 00:58:53,047
that l wanted to mary him,

1077
00:59:08,244 --> 00:59:10,045

Looking and wanting love so bad,

1083
00:59:32,034 --> 00:59:34,515
not knowing howto find it,
Not knowing anybody

1084
00:59:34,603 --> 00:59:38,364
to show them what it is and how to get it,

1085

1097
01:00:59,523 --> 01:01:00,483

1106
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:03,810
Gavin was telling me
how beautiful it was in the Bahamas.

1107
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:05,640
l think l should make it down
there sometime.

1108
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:09,562
Yeah, Phil, you definitely should,
It's beautiful there. Really.

1109
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:11,680
All right,

l was talking to Dianne about this divorce,

1111
01:02:16,233 --> 01:02:18,833
We think it's great how civil
you mo are being about this.

1112
01:02:18,934 --> 01:02:20,895

And we just think it's better
that we're apart,

1116
01:02:30,847 --> 01:02:32,327
Okay, Well, we took your direction

1117
01:02:32,414 --> 01:02:33,855
and divided eveything down the middle,

1118
01:02:33,949 --> 01:02:34,990
Okay,

1119

1121
01:02:41,625 --> 01:02:42,585
Yeah.

1122
01:02:42,692 --> 01:02:45,212

Yeah, that sounds about right. Yeah,

1127
01:03:02,878 --> 01:03:05,039
Don't forget about the other account,

1128
01:03:07,817 --> 01:03:08,777
Gavin was telling me that

1129
01:03:08,918 --> 01:03:10,958
there was another account
that's not listed here,

1130
01:03:11,887 --> 01:03:14,448
lt has about $800,000 in it.

1131
01:03:17,393 --> 01:03:19,874
Yeah, that's the money from my book,

1132
01:03:20,396 --> 01:03:21,877
That's not included?

1133
01:03:22,264 --> 01:03:23,905
We're not omering that,

1134
01:03:27,170 --> 01:03:29,210
Well, l didn't know that.

1135
01:03:30,773 --> 01:03:32,654
But why would l, Gavin?

1136
01:03:33,677 --> 01:03:35,597
-lt's ours,
-Ours?

1137
01:03:36,346 --> 01:03:38,106
Gavin, that's the money l made
from my book sales,

1138
01:03:38,248 --> 01:03:39,888
Why would l include that in the settlement?

1139
01:03:39,983 --> 01:03:41,943
lt's what we built together, Patricia,

1140
01:03:42,085 --> 01:03:43,085
-We?
-VJe.

1141
01:03:43,186 --> 01:03:45,306
''We''? What page did you write, Gavin?

1142
01:03:45,755 --> 01:03:48,115
What book tour lecture were you on?

1143
01:03:49,326 --> 01:03:52,926
Patricia, how many nights
did l stay up all night

1144
01:03:53,028 --> 01:03:56,949
listening to you and your ideas
and giving you some of mine?

1145
01:03:57,032 --> 01:03:59,513
Yeah, but, Gavin,
l didn't use not one ofyour ideas.

1146
01:03:59,635 --> 01:04:02,916
Yes, you have. You always do,
l've always been your case study.

1147
01:04:03,005 --> 01:04:04,646
-Are you serious?
-Are you serious?

1148
01:04:04,773 --> 01:04:07,294
All right, Gavin,
Iet's be reasonable aboutthis.

1149
01:04:07,376 --> 01:04:10,457
lt's my money. l earned it,

1150
01:04:11,146 --> 01:04:13,627
So, can we move on, please?

1151
01:04:13,717 --> 01:04:16,357
No, we're not just gonna move on,

1152
01:04:16,485 --> 01:04:19,646
Okay? You wanna be reasonable?
You include that.

1153
01:04:19,789 --> 01:04:22,709
-Are you reallytying to do this?
-Absolutely.

1154
01:04:28,297 --> 01:04:30,458
All right, fine,

1155
01:04:30,567 --> 01:04:32,007
So, you wanna include it?

1156
01:04:32,135 --> 01:04:34,135
No, l'm not including it, 0ianne,

1157
01:04:34,237 --> 01:04:36,637
-No?
-You know what, Gavin?

1158
01:04:36,739 --> 01:04:39,140
This ain't about the money,

1159
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:41,569
-This is about greed. Your greed,
-You're right.

1160
01:04:42,311 --> 01:04:43,792
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

1161
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,040
l should be greedy,

1162
01:04:45,181 --> 01:04:47,781
'cause l've been starving
in this relationship.

1163
01:04:48,717 --> 01:04:49,998
Can we talk about this in private, please?

1164
01:04:50,085 --> 01:04:52,406
Now you wanna talk about things in private,

1165
01:04:54,090 --> 01:04:56,250
You didn't feel thatway
in the Bahamas, did you?

1166
01:04:56,425 --> 01:04:58,346
When you announced that
we were getting divorced

1167
01:04:58,427 --> 01:05:00,988
in front of all ourfriends,
you never ran that by me.

1168
01:05:01,097 --> 01:05:02,857
Patricia, that is the problem, okay?

1169
01:05:02,998 --> 01:05:04,839
Evemhing is always private with us,

1170
01:05:04,934 --> 01:05:06,694
That is whywe're here,

1171
01:05:06,835 --> 01:05:08,516
Oh, my God, where is this coming from?

1172
01:05:08,605 --> 01:05:10,365
You look in the mirror and you tell me

1173
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:14,000
how you kept up
this farce ofa marriage for 14 years

1174
01:05:14,077 --> 01:05:17,037
when l could've been out there

You know l love you, Gavin,

1177
01:05:26,856 --> 01:05:28,536
You tolerate me.

1178
01:05:28,625 --> 01:05:30,505
-You tolerate, there's a dimerence,
-Tolerate,

1179
01:05:30,592 --> 01:05:34,273
And ever since Noah died,
you have been impossible.

1180
01:05:34,396 --> 01:05:35,557
All right,

1181
01:05:36,632 --> 01:05:39,553
You're tying to hurt me,
l ain't gonna do this.

1182
01:05:39,635 --> 01:05:41,876
-You're not gonna do what?
-No, l'm not standing for this.

1183
01:05:41,971 --> 01:05:42,931
l'm not doing thi_,

1184
01:05:43,072 --> 01:05:44,272
No, you're gonna sit here and listen to this,

1185
01:05:44,407 --> 01:05:46,567
-Not today, l'm not,
-Yes, you are, Patricia.

1186
01:05:46,643 --> 01:05:47,723
-Ye_, you are,

l don't know what we're gonna do,

1238
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:53,220
The mortgage is due here and back home,

1239
01:08:54,497 --> 01:08:56,137
l don't have the money,

1240
01:09:00,235 --> 01:09:02,316

1241
01:09:05,108 --> 01:09:07,948

from Pat or Angela.

1242
01:09:08,511 --> 01:09:09,591
No, you're not,

1243
01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:12,439
We borrow money from each other
all the time, It's not a big deal,

1244
01:09:12,582 --> 01:09:14,102
-Sheila.

-and we need that,
-Sheila!

1246
01:09:16,118 --> 01:09:19,599
You must not have heard
what l said in the Bahamas, No.

1247

1248
01:09:26,762 --> 01:09:28,923

1250
01:09:35,371 --> 01:09:37,811
l've neverseen you like this!

1251
01:09:41,344 --> 01:09:43,504
You know,
we should've never left Colorado.

1252
01:09:43,979 --> 01:09:46,500
l should have followed my first mind,

1253
01:09:49,051 --> 01:09:50,212
Okay,

1254
01:09:50,453 --> 01:09:52,773
So, you're blaming me forthis?

1255
01:09:59,328 --> 01:10:01,008
l'm gonna make some calls,

1256
01:10:02,331 --> 01:10:03,691
Troy ...
-Damn it, Sheila!

1257
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:05,480

1260

people would tell him, ''You can't do that!''

1261
01:10:20,015 --> 01:10:22,656
And when he'd ask, he'd say, ''Why?''
And they'd say, ''Because they say''

1262
01:10:22,752 --> 01:10:24,152

-The other people.

1264
01:10:26,255 --> 01:10:28,655
Other people, right.

That thatjustifies you to bring
somebody into my bed, Marcus?

1351

How do you do that?

1368
01:15:14,143 --> 01:15:17,463
Always have to be in control,
never show any emotion?

1369
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:21,481
You've been drinking again,

You know what you are right now?

1472
01:20:49,345 --> 01:20:50,585

And you heard this from your neighbor?

1479
01:21:16,838 --> 01:21:20,039
Yeah, can you believe that?
She caught me at my car and told me that,

1480
01:21:20,175 --> 01:21:22,055
and l'm gonna find out the truth,

1481
01:21:27,315 --> 01:21:28,836
What the hell are you looking at?

1482
01:21:28,984 --> 01:21:30,544
Was that you on Sports Shunle?

1483
01:21:30,685 --> 01:21:32,846
You know what?
Shuffle that food down yourfat-ass throat

1484

-ShuflIe that! Thank you vey much!
-What's he talking about?

1486
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:41,160
Absolutely nothing,
Dianne, nothing, trust me.

1487
01:21:41,262 --> 01:21:43,823
Can you believe,
Tuesdays and Thursdays in my house?

-No, l really can't.

1489
01:21:45,033 --> 01:21:46,153
-Has he lost his mind?
-Yes.

1490
01:21:46,234 --> 01:21:47,355
Hi, Sheila.

1491
01:21:47,435 --> 01:21:49,196
Hi, how are you?

1492
01:21:50,005 --> 01:21:51,485
Sory, l'm late,

1493
01:21:51,573 --> 01:21:52,693
Where's Pat?

1494
01:21:52,774 --> 01:21:55,175
l tried to call her,
She's not answering her phone, So...

1495
01:21:55,243 --> 01:21:57,724
Oh, my God, Dianne, Is she okay?

1496
01:21:57,845 --> 01:22:00,326
-You guys, l can'ttalk aboutthe case,
-Yes, you can.

1497
01:22:00,416 --> 01:22:01,376
Please, don't,,, Don't ask me, No.

1498
01:22:01,516 --> 01:22:04,077
Come on, She's not okay,

1499
01:22:04,185 --> 01:22:06,146
lt's gonna get ugly, I know it,

1500
01:22:06,255 --> 01:22:10,255
0ivorce_ are born to be ugly,
But Pat and Gavin,,,

1501
01:22:10,859 --> 01:22:13,019
-l know,
-Theywere like a template for us.

1502
01:22:13,127 --> 01:22:14,248
l know. Me, too.

1503
01:22:14,363 --> 01:22:16,603
l mean, whenever l got into it with Tery,
l would just say,

1504
01:22:16,731 --> 01:22:18,772
''What would Patricia do?''
Now, l don't know what to say.

1505
01:22:18,900 --> 01:22:20,221
He's cheating on her, ain't he?

1506
01:22:20,301 --> 01:22:21,582
-Gavin? No,
-Yes. Didn't he?

1507
01:22:21,703 --> 01:22:25,103
-Come on, give up the goods, Dianne.
-No. She didn't say that he did, but...

1508
01:22:25,207 --> 01:22:28,527
How do you really know that your spouse
is cheating, anyway? l mean, really.

1509
01:22:28,609 --> 01:22:31,770
lfyou think he's cheating,
then he's cheating,

1510
01:22:31,913 --> 01:22:34,354
Wait a second, just because you suspect,

1511
01:22:34,449 --> 01:22:36,610
that doesn't mean that it's the truth,
Itjust doesn't,

1512
01:22:36,717 --> 01:22:38,558
l di_agree with that,

1513
01:22:38,654 --> 01:22:40,934
Dianne, eveytime
l caught Marcus cheating,

1514
01:22:41,055 --> 01:22:42,856
l knew it before l found out.

1515
01:22:42,957 --> 01:22:46,878
l know because l know how to listen
to that voice on the inside of me

1516
01:22:46,994 --> 01:22:49,035
that tells me when a man is cheating,

1517
01:22:49,131 --> 01:22:50,451
The voice?

1518
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:54,760
Yeah, butyou smoked
so much weed in college!

1519
01:22:54,837 --> 01:22:57,757
Baby, you might not want to listen
to that voice in your head.

1520
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:00,160
lt's probably still high,

1521
01:23:03,645 --> 01:23:07,725
Seriously, ifyou're always
in a chemically induced state,

1522
01:23:07,815 --> 01:23:10,256
you mightwant to reconsider

1523
01:23:10,351 --> 01:23:12,592
eveything that you're doing,

1524
01:23:12,688 --> 01:23:14,608
And thinking, too,

1525
01:23:14,689 --> 01:23:16,290
What is this, an intervention?

1526
01:23:16,425 --> 01:23:19,425
That has absolutely nothing to do with it,

1527
01:23:19,528 --> 01:23:20,688
l know howto tell.

1528
01:23:20,796 --> 01:23:23,916
lfyour man, if he goes to work all day long

1529
01:23:23,998 --> 01:23:26,839
and then comes home
smelling like a fresh bar of soap,

1530
01:23:26,969 --> 01:23:31,289
something's up. l ain't got time
to be sitting around all day guessing.

1531
01:23:31,372 --> 01:23:34,133
Relationships are supposed to be about

1532
01:23:35,344 --> 01:23:37,504
-trust,
-No, l'm an old-school fool.

1533
01:23:37,645 --> 01:23:40,926
l'm checking his bank statements,
l'm checking his credit card statements,

1534
01:23:41,015 --> 01:23:43,976
l'm checking his timecard atwork
and l'm comparing it

1535
01:23:44,118 --> 01:23:45,999
to the hours that he said he was working

1536
01:23:46,121 --> 01:23:48,481
and it better match the money
he has coming home_

1537
01:23:48,556 --> 01:23:50,117
l'm checking his cell phone bill,

1538
01:23:50,225 --> 01:23:52,505
l'm checking the numbers that
he was calling on his cell phone bill.

1539
01:23:52,627 --> 01:23:55,028
l'm checking his mileage in the car,

1540
01:23:55,130 --> 01:23:57,690
Hisjob is 10,5 miles,

1541
01:23:57,832 --> 01:24:00,273
The kids' school is 2.1 miles.

1542
01:24:00,368 --> 01:24:02,809
l checked the mileage when he goes
to Tery and Dianne's house.

1543
01:24:02,904 --> 01:24:04,785
That is 6,7 miles.

1544
01:24:04,872 --> 01:24:10,793
And when any ofthose miles come back
2,2, or 5,6, or 7,9, or 10,7,,,

1545
01:24:10,878 --> 01:24:12,319
lf he comes back

1546
01:24:12,413 --> 01:24:15,814
and l see 4,8 and a halfofa mile,

1547
01:24:15,917 --> 01:24:17,518
that means he came from Keisha's house,

1548
01:24:17,653 --> 01:24:19,893
he rode to the store
to get some breath spray...

1549
01:24:20,021 --> 01:24:22,662
Do you check his pulse
when he walks through the door?

1550
01:24:22,757 --> 01:24:25,518
His resting heart rate is 42 beats a minute,

1551
01:24:25,594 --> 01:24:28,994
lf Marcus comes home to the house
and he claims he was atwork all day,

1552
01:24:29,064 --> 01:24:33,864
if that resting heart beat is 58 beats
a minute, he's been cheating.

1553
01:24:33,935 --> 01:24:36,016
l'm not doing all that, That's a full-time job,

1554
01:24:36,104 --> 01:24:38,184
-Exactly,
-The bottom line

1555
01:24:38,940 --> 01:24:40,341
is that l have to check him.

1556
01:24:40,442 --> 01:24:44,882
All that time l spent training that man
on how to be right for me,

1557
01:24:45,012 --> 01:24:48,253
you think that l'm really gonna let
some other woman

1558
01:24:48,382 --> 01:24:50,943
ta_e all that on-the-job training?

1559
01:24:51,052 --> 01:24:53,813
-What is he, a man or a puppy? 'Cause,,,
-He ain't either one.

1560
01:24:53,921 --> 01:24:58,842
That's why l got his cell phone right here,
and l'm waiting for itto ring,

1561
01:25:07,769 --> 01:25:10,769
l just hate that Gavin and Patricia
are going through this.

1562
01:25:10,905 --> 01:25:12,426
lt's unbelievable, really,

1563
01:25:13,375 --> 01:25:15,935
Dianne, what happened?

1564
01:25:16,612 --> 01:25:19,052
They want a divorce, that's all l can tell you,

1565
01:25:22,984 --> 01:25:26,025
-l can't say anything, Stop asking me.
-Ring the doorbell.

1566
01:25:27,588 --> 01:25:28,909
Patricia!

1567
01:25:28,990 --> 01:25:31,231
Her car is out there,
l don't know why she's not answering.

1568
01:25:31,326 --> 01:25:32,646
Hey, babe, it's us,

1569
01:25:33,295 --> 01:25:34,775
Come on, let us in.

1570
01:25:34,895 --> 01:25:37,056
We're worried aboutyou, baby, please,

1571
01:26:15,703 --> 01:26:16,904
Hey,

1572
01:26:17,672 --> 01:26:20,433
-Hey, where you been?
-l went out with the girls.

1573
01:26:21,777 --> 01:26:23,137
Where's our son?

1574
01:26:23,211 --> 01:26:25,851
l put him down about an hourago,

1575
01:26:26,381 --> 01:26:28,301
-Okay.
-Babe,..

1576
01:26:29,117 --> 01:26:30,677

1577
01:26:32,386 --> 01:26:34,347
You know, l thought you'd left me,

1578
01:26:36,390 --> 01:26:38,111
Why would you think that?

1579
01:26:38,193 --> 01:26:41,153
Because evey time we get into it,
you threaten to leave me,

1580
01:26:41,296 --> 01:26:43,136
l'm not gonna leave you,

1581
01:26:44,466 --> 01:26:45,706
Good.

1582
01:26:46,333 --> 01:26:48,094
'Cause l don'twant you to leave,

1583
01:26:50,072 --> 01:26:53,352
Baby, married people argue,
even in a good marriage.

1584
01:26:53,475 --> 01:26:56,115
-l know,
-We got a good marriage.

1585
01:26:58,814 --> 01:27:01,214
l don't know what l'd do with out you,

1586
01:27:06,488 --> 01:27:07,888
l cooked.

1587
01:27:12,761 --> 01:27:14,481
Smells good,

1588
01:27:15,930 --> 01:27:17,251
You want some?

1589
01:27:21,936 --> 01:27:23,377

1590
01:27:25,673 --> 01:27:29,314

-Oh, babe, that's great!

1591
01:27:29,411 --> 01:27:31,051
l start tomorrow.

1592
01:27:32,948 --> 01:27:38,148
l mean, it,,, Itjust came out of now here,
It was the craziest thing.

1593
01:27:38,252 --> 01:27:40,533
-Told you.
-Oh, man.

1594
01:27:46,895 --> 01:27:48,335
Sory, man, l saw that, though,

1595
01:27:48,430 --> 01:27:51,870
l'm sitting at home watching it going,
''This is crazy!''

1596
01:27:51,966 --> 01:27:53,727
What's up, Gavin?

1597
01:27:53,868 --> 01:27:55,549
-Hey, hey!

Are you gonna open the door?

01:28:32,841 --> 01:28:34,001
Yeah.

1608
01:28:36,978 --> 01:28:38,618
Gavin!

1609
01:28:39,247 --> 01:28:40,767
She changed the locks,

1610
01:28:43,018 --> 01:28:44,898

to be a pa#t of no crap with y'all,

1614
01:29:01,136 --> 01:29:03,776
No, that's fine, Okay, l have some suitcases

1615
01:29:03,872 --> 01:29:06,272
-some other stum in this,
-Where's Patricia? Is she at work?

1616
01:29:06,373 --> 01:29:09,814
l don't know, l waited across the street
for herto leave. So,,,

1617
01:29:09,944 --> 01:29:11,905
This dude just threw a ficus
through the window!

1618
01:29:12,012 --> 01:29:15,853
Waiting for her,,, What,,, Man, this is not
healthy. Come on, Gavin, l mean, come on!

1619
01:29:15,984 --> 01:29:18,144
Stop this, okay? Please, stop it,

1620
01:29:18,286 --> 01:29:20,046
-She cheated on you, didn't she?
-No,

1621
01:29:20,154 --> 01:29:21,675
-You cheated?
-No.

1622
01:29:21,789 --> 01:29:23,350
Damn, eveybody ain't cheating, okay,,,

1623
01:29:23,490 --> 01:29:27,291
Look, guys, please, Hury up and help me
get my stuff before she comes back.

1624
01:29:30,231 --> 01:29:33,552
Gavin, she don't know about this?

1625
01:29:33,902 --> 01:29:36,142
-No,
-Okay, wait, wait, wait, okay, this is...

1626
01:29:36,238 --> 01:29:39,198
Okay, wait, listen,
Listen to me, okay. Really.

1627
01:29:39,341 --> 01:29:40,621
Fourteen years
you've been with this woman.

1628
01:29:40,708 --> 01:29:43,949
There's gotto be something
in them 14 years somewhere

1629
01:29:44,045 --> 01:29:45,685
that's worth fighting for, This is not cool,

1630
01:29:45,814 --> 01:29:49,574
You can only fight with a person when
they're willing to get in the ring with you.

1631
01:29:49,850 --> 01:29:51,451
She doesn't love me anymore,

1632
01:29:51,552 --> 01:29:53,993
That's what she said, She said
she doesn'twant to be with me, okay?

1633
01:29:54,088 --> 01:29:56,849
l don't love my wife all the time,
She don't love me all the time, okay?

1634
01:29:56,925 --> 01:29:58,485
lt's marriage, It goes in cycles,

1635
01:29:58,592 --> 01:30:01,673
Sometimes you love them, sometimes
you don't, right? You and Angela,,,

1636
01:30:01,762 --> 01:30:03,243
See? See? It goes around,,,

1637
01:30:03,364 --> 01:30:05,725
That is the problem when you're married
to a psychologist, okay?

1638
01:30:05,833 --> 01:30:06,914
They think they know evey damn thing,

1639
01:30:07,034 --> 01:30:10,235
Now, please,
help me get my stum before she comes.

1640
01:30:11,338 --> 01:30:13,539
Man, why do l feel like
we're breaking and entering?

1641
01:30:13,675 --> 01:30:14,755
'Cause we're going tojail,

1642
01:30:14,876 --> 01:30:16,236
This is why
people don'twant to get married.

1643
01:30:16,344 --> 01:30:18,544
The only people who want to get married
are gay people.

1644
01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:21,360
ls this a game you wantto play with me?

1645
01:30:24,953 --> 01:30:26,873
What do you want me to do?
You changed the locks.

1646
01:30:26,954 --> 01:30:29,715
l want you to be a man, all right?

1647
01:30:29,791 --> 01:30:31,991
Leave this marriage
with what you came in with, Gavin.

1648
01:30:32,092 --> 01:30:34,213
Look, l am a man, first ofall, Okay?

1649
01:30:34,296 --> 01:30:37,336
Second ofall, you go down to the bank
and see what this man did.

1650
01:30:38,033 --> 01:30:39,033
l got it all now,

1651
01:30:39,134 --> 01:30:43,614
What makes you think you deserve a dime
of my hard-earned money?

1652
01:30:43,738 --> 01:30:45,218
You want to fight?

1653
01:30:45,306 --> 01:30:48,027
Patricia, Patricia, wait.

1654

-Wait, wait, wait...

1655

l gave you all my 14 years!

1665

Who's the one who put the down payment

1666
01:31:15,502 --> 01:31:19,263
You greedy, selfish son ofa bitch!

What kind of woman do you think l am?

1681

-That's not what l'm tying to do,

Alex, what the hell

1699
01:34:08,309 --> 01:34:12,429
How dare you be having sex
with some ho in my bed,

1700
01:34:12,514 --> 01:34:15,274
And with my maid? Oh, hell, no!

1701
01:34:15,416 --> 01:34:17,336
You're supposed to be cleaning up

1702
01:34:17,452 --> 01:34:20,932
Not sleeping in my bed!

You stupid ass!

1708
01:34:35,203 --> 01:34:36,483
l'm really worried about them,

1709
01:34:36,604 --> 01:34:38,524
l've never seen her like this.

1710
01:34:38,640 --> 01:34:41,600
You need to at least call her orsomething,

1711
01:34:41,708 --> 01:34:43,349
We did, we called her.

1712
01:34:43,778 --> 01:34:45,418
Well, you need to go over there,

1713
01:34:45,512 --> 01:34:48,113
We did go overthere,
You know, she didn't open the door.

1714
01:34:49,716 --> 01:34:51,157
l'm worried about her, and him, too.

1715
01:34:51,286 --> 01:34:53,966
Well, me, too. Trust me.

1716
01:34:54,055 --> 01:34:57,015
But, you know, l'll tell you what,
We'll go over there tomorrow

1717
01:34:57,125 --> 01:35:00,085
and we'll refuse to leave
until she opens the door.

1718
01:35:00,194 --> 01:35:01,555
Okay?

1719
01:35:01,662 --> 01:35:03,383
We'll figure evemhing out,

1720
01:35:06,333 --> 01:35:07,694
Are you wearing that to work?

1721
01:35:08,735 --> 01:35:09,896
Yeah.

1722
01:35:12,340 --> 01:35:13,700
Sexy,

1723
01:35:16,144 --> 01:35:17,544
Oh, yeah?

l'm glad you think it's sey,

1725
01:35:48,376 --> 01:35:49,896
Have you slept with him?

1726
01:35:51,378 --> 01:35:54,379
Slept with who? What,,,
What are you talking about?

1727
01:35:55,682 --> 01:36:00,523
Sixty-three days ago, honey,
you came home and you were dimerent.

1728
01:36:01,456 --> 01:36:04,256
You were happier than l've ever seen you,

1729
01:36:04,725 --> 01:36:06,886
From that dayto thi_ one,

1730
01:36:07,028 --> 01:36:10,028
you started taking a whole lot ofcare
with the clothes you wear.

1731
01:36:10,131 --> 01:36:12,091
Your make up in the morning
takes a little longer,

1732
01:36:12,233 --> 01:36:15,033
your perFumes are dimerent,
the panties you wear.

1733
01:36:15,136 --> 01:36:18,616
From that day to this one,
you just get happier and happier.

1734
01:36:18,739 --> 01:36:20,260
Honey, it's you that makes me,,,

1735
01:36:20,408 --> 01:36:23,568
Dianne, don't make me think l'm crazy

1736
01:36:24,945 --> 01:36:27,386
l know, tell me. Dianne.

1737
01:36:32,987 --> 01:36:35,867
Honey, l love your heartbeat, l know,

1738
01:36:35,957 --> 01:36:36,957
l'm in tune with you,

1739
01:36:37,091 --> 01:36:41,091
You can't be this arrogant
to think that l wasn't paying attention.

1740
01:36:41,962 --> 01:36:43,923
ls his name Philip?

1741
01:36:53,006 --> 01:36:56,207
l'm tying to fix this, okay?
l'm tying to save our ''us''

1742
01:36:56,310 --> 01:36:58,791
l'm tying to fix this,
but you keep lying to me.

1743
01:36:58,912 --> 01:37:01,113
You're just gonna piss me om,
and we won't be able to fix this.

1744
01:37:01,248 --> 01:37:03,129
Dianne, just tell me the truth,

1745
01:37:03,685 --> 01:37:04,845
ls it Philip?

1746
01:37:06,953 --> 01:37:09,314
We haven't done anything, l promise,

1747
01:37:10,158 --> 01:37:14,758
He's funny, he makes me laugh and he,,,
He's an attorney.

1748
01:37:15,496 --> 01:37:19,096
He works at another firm,
Do you really want to hear this?

1749
01:37:22,770 --> 01:37:27,650
Well, we worked on a case together
and then, he invited me to dinner,

1750
01:37:27,774 --> 01:37:29,615
Februay 17th,

1751
01:37:32,846 --> 01:37:35,687
You must have sat really close to him
that night, because

1752
01:37:37,284 --> 01:37:39,125
l could smell him
when you walked through the door.

1753
01:37:39,220 --> 01:37:41,780
We did not do anything,

1754
01:37:41,855 --> 01:37:44,616
After the dinner
l spoke to him on the 'phone

1755
01:37:44,692 --> 01:37:46,812
and l talked to him through e-mail,
It was harmless.

1756
01:37:46,894 --> 01:37:48,654
What happened on March the 8th?

1757
01:37:48,895 --> 01:37:49,856
How do you mean?

1758
01:37:54,167 --> 01:37:56,288
l was the only person in the world,

1759
01:37:57,537 --> 01:37:58,818
Were you with him that night?

1760
01:37:58,905 --> 01:38:00,826
l saw him that day, yes,

1761
01:38:01,676 --> 01:38:03,036
Tery, l love you,

1762
01:38:03,344 --> 01:38:04,864
l love you,

1763
01:38:05,912 --> 01:38:07,193
So...

1764
01:38:09,216 --> 01:38:12,017
When we were having sex,
you were thinking about him?

1765
01:38:15,422 --> 01:38:16,543
Yeah.

1766
01:38:16,657 --> 01:38:18,897
lf you thought about it, then you should,

1767
01:38:19,426 --> 01:38:22,587
Tery, please, l'm sory!

1768
01:38:22,697 --> 01:38:25,017
l'm sory, please!
l won't ever see him again!

1769
01:38:25,099 --> 01:38:28,739
l'll never speak to him,
It's not worth this to me.

1770
01:38:28,869 --> 01:38:32,070
You have to know that l love you, baby!

1771
01:38:34,175 --> 01:38:35,575
Tery!

1772
01:38:55,762 --> 01:38:58,443
So you working late again, Marcus?

1773
01:38:59,132 --> 01:39:02,693
-Yeah,
-You couldn't even call me to tell me that?

1774
01:39:05,439 --> 01:39:07,440
You have my phone,

1775
01:39:07,574 --> 01:39:11,735
Yeah, and somebody's been calling
your phone all day long and hanging up.

1776
01:39:11,878 --> 01:39:13,879
Baby, please don't start,

1777
01:39:13,980 --> 01:39:16,581
Oh, and look at it, it's ringing again,

1778
01:39:18,453 --> 01:39:20,053
Look atthat!

1779
01:39:20,654 --> 01:39:21,975
Hello!

1780
01:39:22,323 --> 01:39:23,643
Hello?

1781
01:39:23,757 --> 01:39:26,638
Hey, you know what, ho?
l'm sick ofy'all calling this phone.

1782
01:39:26,761 --> 01:39:28,881
Stop ringing this damn phone!

1783
01:39:28,962 --> 01:39:32,563
And l hear you breathing,
When are you gonna say something, ho?

1784
01:39:32,667 --> 01:39:35,787
Yeah, All right, You know what?
You're gonna get punched in the face.

1785
01:39:35,903 --> 01:39:38,543
-You ain't got nothing to say,
-Give me the phone.

1786
01:39:40,106 --> 01:39:42,307
Here, Go on and call your little ho back,

1787
01:39:45,680 --> 01:39:48,440
Angela, these are text messages,

1788
01:39:48,916 --> 01:39:52,476
You cannot answer a text message
by picking up the phone,

1789
01:39:52,920 --> 01:39:55,480
Nobody has been calling all day,

1790
01:39:55,590 --> 01:39:59,070
That is ridiculous! Some old stupid phone
that can't nobody work.

1791
01:39:59,159 --> 01:40:01,000
Maybe it ain't the phone that',,,

1792
01:40:02,662 --> 01:40:05,343
Look, Just read the text messages,

1793
01:40:05,466 --> 01:40:07,586
No, l ain't reading nothing, Marcus, No,

1794
01:40:07,667 --> 01:40:09,028
Good night,

1795
01:40:10,438 --> 01:40:12,518
Just give me the damn phone,

1796
01:40:13,306 --> 01:40:15,067
How do you wore this thing?

1797
01:40:21,047 --> 01:40:22,208
Whatever.

1798
01:40:23,818 --> 01:40:25,818
Wow, that's all from work?

1799
01:40:28,189 --> 01:40:29,709
You still don't trust me.

1800
01:40:30,358 --> 01:40:32,358
Honey, l'm so sory!

1801
01:40:33,461 --> 01:40:36,541
Honey, come here, Wait a minute,
Come here, baby.. Just...

01:40:45,805 --> 01:40:49,366
lt's okay, Angela,
Look, l've gotto get some sleep, all right?

1805
01:40:50,077 --> 01:40:51,837
No, let's talk!

1806
01:40:51,912 --> 01:40:54,793
lt's a good time to talk,
the kids are upstairs.

1807
01:40:54,881 --> 01:40:56,642
l'm so sory,

01:41:00,988 --> 01:41:05,068
Sometimes l feel like you might end up

1810
01:41:05,192 --> 01:41:07,072
ls that what you been thinking about?

01:41:11,899 --> 01:41:13,579
Those days are over for me,

1813
01:41:13,935 --> 01:41:16,335
Believe me, Trust me.

1814
01:41:17,104 --> 01:41:19,264
Honey, sometimes, l just.. l don't know,

1815
01:41:19,372 --> 01:41:22,053
l just wonder, like,
why do you want to staywith me?

1816
01:41:22,176 --> 01:41:24,856
Baby, l love you!

1817
01:41:24,945 --> 01:41:26,586
That's why l'm here,

1818
01:41:27,113 --> 01:41:29,234
And one day, you are gonna know that,

1819
01:41:29,350 --> 01:41:32,590
And one day,
you're gonna be able to trust me again.

1820
01:41:33,887 --> 01:41:36,888
But right now, l got to get some sleep,

1822
01:41:39,694 --> 01:41:41,534
And the kids are asleep,

01:41:41,628 --> 01:41:43,789

Yeah, they did,

1840
01:42:33,346 --> 01:42:34,747
l got to be honest with you,

1841
01:42:34,849 --> 01:42:38,049
Anytime the boss tells us
you come highly recommended,

1842
01:42:38,152 --> 01:42:39,392
you never know,

1843
01:42:39,487 --> 01:42:41,167
Highly recommended by who?

1844
01:42:42,590 --> 01:42:45,670
One of his golfing buddies,
Mike, l don't know, somebody.

1845
01:42:45,792 --> 01:42:47,633
The guy's a jerk,

1846
01:42:47,761 --> 01:42:50,522
Anmay, he said that your wife asked him
to hook you up.

1847
01:42:51,832 --> 01:42:53,512
You know where he lives?

1848
01:43:27,568 --> 01:43:31,128
What the hell are you doing here?
Are you kidding me?

1849
01:43:31,204 --> 01:43:33,165
Are you tying to play me
for some kind offool or something?

1850
01:43:33,239 --> 01:43:35,280
-l am not,,,
-What the hell are you doing here, Sheila?

1851
01:43:35,376 --> 01:43:37,136
-You are not supposed to be here!
-Wait. Wait.

1852
01:43:37,243 --> 01:43:39,804
Where is he? Where is he? Don't touch me!

1853
01:43:39,880 --> 01:43:41,160
Listen to me, Listen to me.

1854
01:43:41,247 --> 01:43:42,888
-Wait! Wait! Wait!
-Where's Mike? Where's Mike?

1855
01:43:43,016 --> 01:43:44,977
Don't touch me,
Don't put your hands on me.

1856
01:43:45,086 --> 01:43:46,966
-Let me just talk to you!
-You got.. You know what?

1857
01:43:47,054 --> 01:43:49,214
You can't explain this! Where is he?

1858
01:43:49,323 --> 01:43:50,323
Oh, my God!

1859
01:43:50,423 --> 01:43:51,544
Get up!

1860
01:43:51,658 --> 01:43:54,419
Yo, get up! Get up!

l'm talking to you, Get up!

1862
01:43:56,262 --> 01:44:00,743
Oh, my God, Oh, my God. Wait, wait, Troy!

1863
01:44:01,435 --> 01:44:03,635
-What? How could you be here?
-Baby, l'm helping him.

1864
01:44:03,738 --> 01:44:05,338
You think l need him to get a job?

1865
01:44:05,439 --> 01:44:08,839
He's got cancer,
l'm just taking him to chemo.

1866
01:44:08,908 --> 01:44:12,069
l don't care. l don't care!

1867
01:44:12,179 --> 01:44:14,579
-That's howyou do me?
-No!

1868
01:44:20,688 --> 01:44:22,248
l'm sory,

1869
01:44:32,565 --> 01:44:35,046
lt's a mess in here.

1870
01:44:39,640 --> 01:44:41,440
Why won't this light come on?

1871
01:44:41,975 --> 01:44:44,296
-Open the drapes,
-No.

1872
01:44:47,948 --> 01:44:49,308
l'm okay,

1873
01:44:49,817 --> 01:44:51,937
Can you please leave?

1874
01:44:52,552 --> 01:44:54,553
Pattie, we're not leaving,

1875
01:44:55,756 --> 01:44:58,636
Angela.. l have,,,

1876
01:44:59,926 --> 01:45:04,247
l have no more fight left in me. Please,

1877
01:45:06,266 --> 01:45:09,307
-Please,
-Do you really want us to go?

1878
01:45:16,676 --> 01:45:18,237
Please leave.

1879
01:45:18,345 --> 01:45:21,385
Okay, listen, can we make a deal with you?

1880
01:45:21,481 --> 01:45:23,602
What ifwe just sit here?

1881
01:45:24,451 --> 01:45:26,211
Then can we stay?

1882
01:46:27,581 --> 01:46:30,061
Gavin, man, it's irrelevant,
l don't even blame this guy.

1883
01:46:30,184 --> 01:46:31,344
He don't know me, l don't know him.

1884
01:46:31,417 --> 01:46:33,178
But it's her,
She should know betterthan that.

1885
01:46:33,253 --> 01:46:34,974
At least she didn't do nothing with him,

1886
01:46:35,055 --> 01:46:36,335
Marcus, man, come on.

1887
01:46:36,422 --> 01:46:39,023
lt don't matter ifshe slept with him or not,
Women are different from men.

1888
01:46:39,158 --> 01:46:41,919
Men can have sex with this one and
that one and have no connection at all,

1889
01:46:42,029 --> 01:46:43,189
get up and go on about their business,

1890
01:46:43,264 --> 01:46:45,344
leave 8200 on the dresser.
You know what l'm saying?

1891
01:46:45,431 --> 01:46:49,512
Women are emotional creatures, and
when they have an affair emotionally,

1892
01:46:49,603 --> 01:46:52,163
it's way worse than sex,
l don't even want to hear that.

1893
01:46:52,238 --> 01:46:55,319
She vowed not to talk to him again,
so, you know, keep that.

1894
01:46:55,442 --> 01:46:57,682
-l don't wantto hearthat,
-Well, then you should state it.

1895
01:46:57,778 --> 01:47:01,698
Tery, trust me,
you don't want to go through a divorce.

1896
01:47:01,782 --> 01:47:03,342
Why, because
ofwhat you're going through?

1897
01:47:03,449 --> 01:47:05,170
You don't want to be like him,
You ain't the divorcing kind.

1898
01:47:05,252 --> 01:47:06,772
That's what l'm tying to say, trust me,

1899
01:47:07,554 --> 01:47:08,714
Hey, Sheriff,

1900
01:47:08,788 --> 01:47:11,069
l'm sory if l hurt you. l didn't know,

1901
01:47:11,190 --> 01:47:12,671
We're good,

1902
01:47:12,760 --> 01:47:14,760
Look, l know we don't know each other.

1903
01:47:14,895 --> 01:47:18,215
But you should know your wife
and she ain't that way.

1904
01:47:18,298 --> 01:47:19,779
l know my wife,

1905
01:47:20,734 --> 01:47:22,214
There you go,

1906
01:47:22,302 --> 01:47:24,063
The best man won.

1907
01:47:24,203 --> 01:47:27,244
Now, y'all listen up, evey one ofyou,

1908
01:47:27,373 --> 01:47:29,294
Man, life is too short.

1909
01:47:29,909 --> 01:47:31,430
Trust me.

1910
01:47:32,246 --> 01:47:35,366
So, you all need to make this right.
All right? Fix it,

1911
01:47:35,983 --> 01:47:37,943
So, why didn't you tell us
that you were sick?

1912
01:47:38,085 --> 01:47:40,765
That's what l want to know, man,
What's up with that? We're your friends.

1913
01:47:40,887 --> 01:47:42,368
What good would that have done?

1914
01:47:42,456 --> 01:47:44,056
You guys are still at each other's throats,

1915
01:47:44,158 --> 01:47:46,038
Yeah, butwe'd have looked out for you,

1916
01:47:46,592 --> 01:47:48,753
Look, l'II be fine, all right?

1917
01:47:48,828 --> 01:47:51,309
You know l'm a fighter,

1918
01:47:52,666 --> 01:47:54,106
l'Il beat it.

1919
01:47:57,003 --> 01:48:00,444

1923

1924
01:48:19,092 --> 01:48:21,253
