1
00:01:18,502 --> 00:01:21,669
Somebody help me! I can't swim!

2
00:01:23,633 --> 00:01:25,838
Get the raft!

3
00:01:57,206 --> 00:01:59,245
Somebody help me!

4
00:05:50,432 --> 00:05:52,472
What is that?

5
00:05:52,601 --> 00:05:55,555
It's a glow stick.

6
00:05:58,815 --> 00:06:00,854
How does it work?

7
00:06:00,983 --> 00:06:03,854
From some kind of chemical.

8
00:06:14,789 --> 00:06:17,660
Do you think anybody else is here, sir?

9
00:06:17,792 --> 00:06:21,493
It's just an island. There's nothing here.

10
00:06:25,215 --> 00:06:28,716
- I'm thirsty.
- Yeah, me too. I'm hungry.

11
00:06:29,679 --> 00:06:33,379
What if there's no water?

12
00:06:33,516 --> 00:06:36,885
We're all thirsty and we're all hungry.

13
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:39,937
We should just try and get some sleep.

14
00:06:40,064 --> 00:06:44,641
And tomorrow we'll figure out
what we're gonna do.

15
00:07:19,644 --> 00:07:21,802
Water.

16
00:07:21,938 --> 00:07:23,978
Water.

17
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:27,498
Sir. Sir.

18
00:08:29,045 --> 00:08:31,083
I found water.

19
00:09:24,681 --> 00:09:27,801
Well, that's it, Colonel.

20
00:09:48,956 --> 00:09:50,994
What's that?

21
00:09:52,417 --> 00:09:54,789
It's a conch.

22
00:09:54,919 --> 00:09:57,670
My granny had one.

23
00:09:57,797 --> 00:10:04,002
If it had a hole in it right there
you could really blow it, like a trumpet.

24
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:14,981
Come on! Give us some.

25
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:36,200
Sh! Come on.

26
00:11:30,054 --> 00:11:35,926
OK, listen up. Whoever holds the conch
gets to speak. That's the rule.

27
00:11:36,059 --> 00:11:38,099
Is this like assembly, sir?

28
00:11:38,228 --> 00:11:41,845
Yeah. Except anybody
who wants to speak gets to.

29
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:44,269
But not before they get the conch.

30
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:49,359
Right. There doesn't seem
to be anybody here except us.

31
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:51,648
- And a pig.
- It was a wild boar.

32
00:11:51,784 --> 00:11:54,985
No, it was a regular pig. Big, but regular.

33
00:11:55,119 --> 00:11:58,239
A regular pig must have
got here from people.

34
00:11:58,372 --> 00:12:01,077
Yeah. If there's pigs, there's people.

35
00:12:01,209 --> 00:12:06,285
OK, cadets. Like I said,
this island's probably uninhabited.

36
00:12:06,421 --> 00:12:10,835
- We don't know. We've gotta explore.
- There's a lot to do.

37
00:12:10,968 --> 00:12:16,970
But the main thing is, we're not
by ourselves. We got Captain Benson.

38
00:12:17,099 --> 00:12:19,138
Can I speak?

39
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:26,347
The most important thing is,
who knows we're here?

40
00:12:26,482 --> 00:12:30,979
Nobody knows we're here.
They know where we were going.

41
00:12:31,113 --> 00:12:35,240
But they don't know where we are.
We never got where we were going.

42
00:12:35,366 --> 00:12:39,364
- Where were we going?
- We were going home.

43
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:46,120
I'm sure they're looking.

44
00:12:46,251 --> 00:12:49,786
We should set up some kind
of steady signal, like a fire,

45
00:12:49,922 --> 00:12:54,550
and keep it going all the time.
And we're gonna have to have rules.

46
00:13:00,098 --> 00:13:02,969
Can I have the conch?

47
00:13:04,186 --> 00:13:08,135
Yes, Ralph's right.
We've definitely gotta make a fire.

48
00:13:08,273 --> 00:13:11,938
- Sir, are you the leader?
- Jack's the oldest.

49
00:13:12,069 --> 00:13:15,438
- But Ralph's the colonel.
- I think it should be Ralph.

50
00:13:15,573 --> 00:13:18,323
- I vote for Ralph.
- Yeah, he's a colonel.

51
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:20,822
- Yeah, Ralph.
- He's the colonel. Ralph.

52
00:13:20,952 --> 00:13:25,662
- I guess you just won the election.
- It doesn't matter who's in charge.

53
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:29,917
We've just gotta work together.
First, we build a camp.

54
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:50,309
Be careful.

55
00:13:51,606 --> 00:13:57,278
There's probably a lot of berries and
things that look OK but are really poison.

56
00:13:57,405 --> 00:13:59,813
I know what's poisonous or not.

57
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:05,025
My brother did Outward Bound,
learned how to survive. He taught me.

58
00:14:05,162 --> 00:14:09,326
Did he do Outward Bound in the tropics?

59
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:12,031
- Not exactly.
- Then where?

60
00:14:13,128 --> 00:14:14,705
Colorado.

61
00:14:14,838 --> 00:14:20,046
There are totally different poison plants
in Colorado than in this place.

62
00:14:20,177 --> 00:14:23,711
So we've gotta take precautions
or it won't matter.

63
00:14:23,847 --> 00:14:27,797
- What won't matter?
- Whether we get rescued.

64
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:32,145
Better learn to live with yourself,
because we ain't gonna get rescued.

65
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:35,521
- What are you talking about?
- Just being logical.

66
00:14:35,649 --> 00:14:41,155
A plane goes down in the ocean, there's
no wreckage - who's gonna find us?

67
00:14:41,281 --> 00:14:45,408
- Why don't you just shut up?
- Are you telling me to shut up?

68
00:14:45,535 --> 00:14:50,611
What we need around here is positive
people, not people trying to scare people.

69
00:14:50,748 --> 00:14:53,155
What we don't need is you, shitbrain.

70
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:56,376
His name's not shitbrain. It's Piggy.

71
00:14:56,503 --> 00:14:58,661
Yeah, Piggy! Yeah!

72
00:15:03,094 --> 00:15:06,093
Shut up. Everybody just shut up.

73
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:13,467
- It's just cos you're new.
- No, it's not. It's always this way.

74
00:15:13,604 --> 00:15:16,390
Just cut it out, OK?

75
00:15:18,149 --> 00:15:21,981
- Mama, mama, can't you see
- Mama, mama, can't you see

76
00:15:22,112 --> 00:15:26,061
- What the army's done to me?
- What the army's done to me?

77
00:15:26,199 --> 00:15:30,066
- They put me in a barber's chair.
- They put me in a barber's chair.

78
00:15:30,203 --> 00:15:33,952
- Spun me round, I had no hair.
- Spun me round, I had no hair.

79
00:15:34,082 --> 00:15:37,864
- I used to drive a Cadillac.
- I used to drive a Cadillac.

80
00:15:38,001 --> 00:15:41,870
- Now I'm marching in a pack.
- Now I'm marching in a pack.

81
00:15:42,006 --> 00:15:45,541
- I used to drive a Chevrolet.
- I used to drive a Chevrolet.

82
00:15:45,677 --> 00:15:49,508
- Now I'm marching for my pay.
- Now I'm marching for my pay.

83
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:53,303
- They took away my TV.
- They took away my TV.

84
00:15:53,433 --> 00:15:57,218
- Got me doing IOT.
- Got me doing IOT.

85
00:15:57,354 --> 00:16:01,221
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

86
00:16:01,358 --> 00:16:03,398
Whoa, oh, oh.

87
00:16:06,947 --> 00:16:10,232
- Come on, let me try.
- I got it, I got it.

88
00:16:12,535 --> 00:16:14,445
Shit!

89
00:16:14,579 --> 00:16:16,987
- Damn! Mother...
- Swearing won't help.

90
00:16:17,124 --> 00:16:21,168
- Listen, Piggy, shut your fat ass.
- Hold it! Hold it!

91
00:16:21,294 --> 00:16:25,790
Hey, wait a minute.
Piggy, give me your glasses.

92
00:16:25,924 --> 00:16:28,545
- Hey, give 'em back.
- Trust me.

93
00:16:28,677 --> 00:16:31,345
What are you doing?

94
00:16:56,036 --> 00:16:59,120
- Fire!
- Yeah!

95
00:17:22,062 --> 00:17:25,180
Jesus, it's spreading!
Put it out. Stomp on it.

96
00:17:25,313 --> 00:17:28,565
Come on, run and stomp on it.

97
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:34,196
Beat it back. Use your jacket.

98
00:17:34,323 --> 00:17:37,823
Beat it back. Come on, guys, beat it back.

99
00:18:59,488 --> 00:19:04,945
About time you showed up. People ought
to be fined for being late for fire watch.

100
00:19:05,078 --> 00:19:06,905
Bullshit.

101
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:22,384
The forest was totally dark,

102
00:19:22,511 --> 00:19:26,426
but he had to keep going
because the thing was behind him.

103
00:19:26,557 --> 00:19:29,345
The pus was everywhere.

104
00:19:29,477 --> 00:19:35,894
He could feel it and, all the while,
the thing behind him kept coming closer.

105
00:19:36,025 --> 00:19:38,979
And then, suddenly,

106
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:44,651
he realized it wasn't any normal plants
or bushes he was trying to run through.

107
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:48,365
It wasn't the leaves or plants
brushing up against him,

108
00:19:48,495 --> 00:19:50,986
touching his arms and face.

109
00:19:51,122 --> 00:19:55,499
It was thousands of claws,
long claws, grasping at him,

110
00:19:55,626 --> 00:19:58,913
trying to stop him
and hold him for the thing.

111
00:19:59,048 --> 00:20:04,467
And he tried to get away, but they held on,
choking him. He tried to scream. Argh!

112
00:20:11,893 --> 00:20:14,300
It's only a story.

113
00:20:14,436 --> 00:20:17,010
It's not real.

114
00:20:19,692 --> 00:20:24,104
I don't know if he can hold up.
What if he suddenly gets really sick?

115
00:20:24,237 --> 00:20:28,485
Man, you gotta stop worrying
so much. We got it made.

116
00:20:28,617 --> 00:20:33,444
No parents, no teachers,
no academy, no girls.

117
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:36,070
Of course, I wouldn't mind getting a little.

118
00:20:36,207 --> 00:20:40,751
- Like you ever got any.
- Well, I still wouldn't mind.

119
00:20:48,679 --> 00:20:51,050
Oh! My arm.

120
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:53,671
You OK?

121
00:20:53,808 --> 00:20:55,847
Psych!

122
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:33,131
Nearly got him. Next time.

123
00:21:37,225 --> 00:21:40,309
Do you think it has any protein in it?

124
00:21:42,021 --> 00:21:44,774
Here, give it here.

125
00:21:52,573 --> 00:21:57,366
I heard they're supposed
to taste like chicken.

126
00:22:33,655 --> 00:22:36,277
Want some?

127
00:22:49,588 --> 00:22:52,257
- Are you telling the truth?
- Yeah.

128
00:22:54,008 --> 00:22:57,792
- We don't believe you.
- Yeah, you're lying.

129
00:22:58,637 --> 00:23:02,137
Why aren't you getting ready?

130
00:23:02,266 --> 00:23:04,638
Sir, is it really true?

131
00:23:04,768 --> 00:23:09,312
You bet it is. Simon's right.
We're gonna be rescued.

132
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,266
Get your things together, guys.
We're going home.

133
00:24:33,979 --> 00:24:35,640
I...

134
00:24:54,791 --> 00:24:56,832
Beat it, you kids.

135
00:24:56,961 --> 00:25:01,088
Come on. Why isn't anybody
getting food or wood?

136
00:25:38,501 --> 00:25:41,502
- Spit! Come on!
- Come on! Spit!

137
00:25:42,297 --> 00:25:44,336
- Spit!
- Go on, spit!

138
00:25:44,465 --> 00:25:46,624
- Spit.
- I got it. There it is.

139
00:25:46,759 --> 00:25:50,708
No, you're not gonna get out
until I see it splash in the ocean.

140
00:25:50,846 --> 00:25:54,973
- That made it.
- No, I didn't see it splash.

141
00:25:56,393 --> 00:25:59,395
- Ow!
- See? It splashed again.

142
00:26:01,482 --> 00:26:04,436
Ha! It's our turn to have fun.

143
00:26:11,491 --> 00:26:13,318
Assembly!

144
00:26:20,582 --> 00:26:22,623
What's going on?

145
00:26:23,753 --> 00:26:26,919
The reason I'm calling
this assembly is,

146
00:26:27,048 --> 00:26:32,469
too many people are screwing around and
not working. There's a bunch of things.

147
00:26:32,595 --> 00:26:35,086
Some kids don't know
when to use the bathroom.

148
00:26:35,222 --> 00:26:37,891
There was this one kid the other day,

149
00:26:38,016 --> 00:26:40,721
he took a shit in his pants
and then sat in it.

150
00:26:40,852 --> 00:26:45,812
I'm not naming names
cos it's possible Mikey couldn't help it.

151
00:26:48,277 --> 00:26:51,776
Was it green? Was it running
down your legs?

152
00:26:51,905 --> 00:26:55,025
Everybody shut their goddamn mouths!

153
00:26:55,158 --> 00:26:58,194
Ralph's got the conch.

154
00:26:59,329 --> 00:27:01,998
All I mean is, we have
to have more discipline.

155
00:27:02,123 --> 00:27:05,209
And more spearfishing.
We've gotta have real food.

156
00:27:05,336 --> 00:27:10,043
- We should be hunting pigs.
- That's all I got to say.

157
00:27:10,173 --> 00:27:14,253
- Anyone else want the conch?
- Some jerk-off stole my pocketknife.

158
00:27:14,385 --> 00:27:16,959
Yeah, things are disappearing all over.

159
00:27:17,097 --> 00:27:20,761
- What are we gonna do with thieves?
- Kick the shit out of them.

160
00:27:20,892 --> 00:27:24,842
- Shove their dick in the conch!
- Put a stick up their butt.

161
00:27:24,979 --> 00:27:27,767
- Ram it in there!
- OK, OK!

162
00:27:30,025 --> 00:27:33,276
We can't have kids
stealing and running wild.

163
00:27:33,404 --> 00:27:38,908
We're gonna have to have stricter rules.
And hand out demerits, I guess.

164
00:27:39,034 --> 00:27:40,990
- Demerits!
- Demerits?

165
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:43,491
Demerits for grand larceny?

166
00:27:43,621 --> 00:27:46,659
- Eat shit and die.
- Yeah!

167
00:27:53,506 --> 00:27:55,214
Sir?

168
00:27:56,176 --> 00:27:58,334
Are we ever going home?

169
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:02,253
Of course we are,
as soon as they see our signal.

170
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:06,388
Jack says that we're never
gonna be rescued.

171
00:28:07,188 --> 00:28:10,437
No, you misunderstood him.
That's not what he meant.

172
00:28:10,565 --> 00:28:14,514
That's exactly what I meant.
There's eight million islands out here.

173
00:28:14,652 --> 00:28:18,270
Why should they find this one?

174
00:28:18,406 --> 00:28:22,404
Don't listen to him.
We will be rescued, Peter.

175
00:28:22,535 --> 00:28:24,822
Honest.

176
00:28:35,798 --> 00:28:39,297
Are you going hunting for pigs again?
I wanna come next time.

177
00:28:39,427 --> 00:28:41,300
Me too.

178
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:45,765
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

179
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:05,447
Hey, cut it out.

180
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:09,078
Are you crazy? Stop it.

181
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:18,295
You know why Jack got sent
to military school?

182
00:29:18,422 --> 00:29:22,041
- Because he was in trouble.
- Who says?

183
00:29:22,176 --> 00:29:26,673
Tony. Jack told him he took a car
and drove it on the highway.

184
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:31,550
- He's a liar. He didn't steal a car.
- He didn't say he stole it.

185
00:29:31,684 --> 00:29:33,927
He borrowed it. It was a neighbor's.

186
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:39,021
And the neighbor was away and he just
borrowed it and drove it on the highway.

187
00:29:39,151 --> 00:29:42,602
He probably rode his dad's bicycle
around the block.

188
00:29:42,738 --> 00:29:46,153
- Then how come he got arrested?
- Yeah, by the highway patrol.

189
00:29:46,283 --> 00:29:49,069
They got him doing 80.

190
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:54,206
Ugh!

191
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:56,830
Ugh!

192
00:30:06,803 --> 00:30:09,175
What time is it?

193
00:30:09,305 --> 00:30:11,974
What difference does it make?

194
00:30:12,099 --> 00:30:17,260
Well, if I knew what time it was
I'd know what's on TV.

195
00:30:20,191 --> 00:30:24,188
- I'm not even sure what day it is.
- It's Monday.

196
00:30:25,946 --> 00:30:29,197
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

197
00:30:29,325 --> 00:30:32,241
Mondays. Monday's ALF.

198
00:30:32,368 --> 00:30:37,826
ALF comes on at eight o'clock.
It's a lot later than eight.

199
00:30:37,958 --> 00:30:42,252
Yeah. But I bet we're in
a different time zone.

200
00:30:42,379 --> 00:30:48,381
I bet it's really about eight o'clock and
ALF's causing some trouble right now.

201
00:30:48,509 --> 00:30:50,336
Yeah.

202
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:19,325
They're mean and they move fast.
They ain't gonna be easy to kill.

203
00:31:19,457 --> 00:31:26,206
- You gotta get 'em first time, in the heart.
- I guess the spear's gotta be real sharp.

204
00:31:27,714 --> 00:31:30,550
We have to have a strategy.
You know, trick 'em.

205
00:31:30,676 --> 00:31:33,346
Oh, sure. How we supposed to do that?

206
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:37,383
You just smoke 'em out.
You crawl up, light a little fire.

207
00:31:37,515 --> 00:31:40,600
We have to practice on stuff that moves.

208
00:31:42,563 --> 00:31:44,223
Ew.

209
00:31:45,191 --> 00:31:47,515
Jesus Christ.

210
00:32:13,092 --> 00:32:16,591
When do we do it?
I mean, like, what time of day?

211
00:32:16,721 --> 00:32:21,048
You always go right before dawn.
Maybe you can catch 'em asleep.

212
00:32:34,279 --> 00:32:36,520
Simon!

213
00:32:50,003 --> 00:32:52,956
Simon can't stay with him
every single second.

214
00:32:53,088 --> 00:32:54,713
Sh.

215
00:32:56,884 --> 00:32:59,173
And he's scared of everyone else.

216
00:32:59,303 --> 00:33:05,092
I'm scared of him. He's crazy.
We've gotta do something.

217
00:33:05,225 --> 00:33:09,176
- Maybe we should tie him down.
- That or get rid of him.

218
00:33:09,313 --> 00:33:14,105
Come on. He's hurt bad and he has
a fever. We've gotta take care of him.

219
00:33:14,234 --> 00:33:18,018
Why bother?
He ain't gonna make it.

220
00:33:18,155 --> 00:33:22,366
- We've gotta take care of ourselves.
- Exactly.

221
00:34:41,778 --> 00:34:43,900
Captain Benson!

222
00:34:49,034 --> 00:34:51,074
Captain!

223
00:34:53,707 --> 00:34:55,746
Captain Benson!

224
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:10,009
Captain Benson!

225
00:35:10,972 --> 00:35:14,139
Save your breath, man.

226
00:35:14,267 --> 00:35:18,396
He's gotta be close by.
He's probably just lost.

227
00:35:24,694 --> 00:35:26,319
Look.

228
00:35:40,459 --> 00:35:44,920
It's nobody's fault, Simon.
He just didn't know what he was doing.

229
00:35:45,047 --> 00:35:49,259
I don't think it's what you think.
I don't think he's dead.

230
00:35:49,385 --> 00:35:52,338
- Why not?
- Where are his shoes?

231
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:54,629
We've gotta keep looking.

232
00:35:54,765 --> 00:35:57,435
He just swam out in 'em.

233
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:02,267
And his belt? He left his pants
and swam out in his shoes and belt?

234
00:36:02,397 --> 00:36:05,066
He was crazy, Simon.

235
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,173
- There it is! Get it!
- Get it!

236
00:36:43,063 --> 00:36:45,101
- Kill it!
- Yeah!

237
00:36:52,488 --> 00:36:55,820
Roger, are you OK, man?
That was some jump.

238
00:36:55,949 --> 00:36:58,819
I got him right up his ass.

239
00:36:59,996 --> 00:37:02,665
- Right up the ass!
- Yeah!

240
00:37:07,585 --> 00:37:10,836
- Get him! Get him!
- Yeah!

241
00:37:10,964 --> 00:37:13,965
Hey, come on! Cut it out! Stop it!

242
00:37:19,471 --> 00:37:22,557
- You dorks. It hurt.
- I know it hurt.

243
00:38:32,084 --> 00:38:36,912
I've been thinking about a clock.
We could make a clock.

244
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:39,918
Yeah, sure, Piggy. Then a TV.

245
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:44,676
No, really. We could make a sundial
with a stick in the ground.

246
00:38:45,972 --> 00:38:48,013
What's that noise?

247
00:38:54,981 --> 00:38:57,935
- Look, there it is!
- Help!

248
00:38:58,068 --> 00:39:00,475
Over here!

249
00:39:00,612 --> 00:39:03,814
- Help!
- Please!

250
00:39:25,844 --> 00:39:28,132
Over here!

251
00:39:28,388 --> 00:39:30,298
Over here!

252
00:39:31,225 --> 00:39:33,265
Over here!

253
00:39:36,522 --> 00:39:38,561
Over here!

254
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:41,689
Over here!

255
00:40:11,305 --> 00:40:14,924
If you guys hadn't let the fire go out
they would have seen it.

256
00:40:15,059 --> 00:40:18,309
- Hey, man, we were hunting.
- Great. Killed a pig.

257
00:40:18,437 --> 00:40:21,308
Face it, you fucked up.
We could have been rescued.

258
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,856
Back off, man.
I'm sick of your shit and so's my gang.

259
00:40:24,986 --> 00:40:27,311
Your gang?
What's that supposed to mean?

260
00:40:27,447 --> 00:40:32,487
It means that if you know what's good for
you you'll stop trying to run everything.

261
00:40:34,286 --> 00:40:36,860
Stop it!

262
00:40:44,337 --> 00:40:49,461
I'm sick of this. I'm gonna make a camp
for hunters and guys who wanna have fun.

263
00:40:49,592 --> 00:40:50,872
Yeah!

264
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:54,177
Come on, that's crazy.
We've gotta work together.

265
00:40:54,973 --> 00:40:58,307
- Come on, what do you say?
- I say fuck you.

266
00:40:58,436 --> 00:41:01,103
And that goes for you too, Miss Piggy.

267
00:41:01,228 --> 00:41:05,013
Come on, let's get out
of this kindergarten.

268
00:41:13,032 --> 00:41:16,946
- I'm with you, Jack.
- Right on, Larry.

269
00:41:17,078 --> 00:41:22,747
When you other brats get older or get
hungry enough, you can come join us too.

270
00:41:37,598 --> 00:41:40,682
They're back! Simon, they're back!

271
00:41:46,314 --> 00:41:49,683
Are you all right?
It's only a storm.

272
00:41:56,323 --> 00:42:00,157
- Where's your brother?
- I don't know.

273
00:42:00,287 --> 00:42:03,820
He must be in the other shelter.

274
00:42:08,377 --> 00:42:12,292
Quick, get out of there!
That tree's gonna go!

275
00:42:38,656 --> 00:42:40,695
Help me!

276
00:42:44,705 --> 00:42:46,744
Over here!

277
00:43:09,561 --> 00:43:11,388
Help!

278
00:43:15,443 --> 00:43:17,815
Where are the others?

279
00:43:17,945 --> 00:43:19,984
I don't know.

280
00:43:28,913 --> 00:43:31,583
Peter, where are you?

281
00:44:12,163 --> 00:44:13,788
Ralph!

282
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:18,170
Yeah?

283
00:44:34,853 --> 00:44:36,976
Where are you?

284
00:44:37,105 --> 00:44:39,144
Over here.

285
00:44:45,153 --> 00:44:48,108
Wait. Wait for me.

286
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,281
Well, come on.

287
00:44:55,789 --> 00:44:59,787
- Where'd you get that from?
- Right here.

288
00:45:06,550 --> 00:45:08,589
Ralph!

289
00:45:08,719 --> 00:45:11,803
- Yeah?
- Over here. We found fruit.

290
00:45:30,072 --> 00:45:32,362
Do you think the other guys are OK?

291
00:45:32,492 --> 00:45:36,703
- Who cares?
- OK, dork. I was just asking.

292
00:45:40,667 --> 00:45:43,418
We should relight the fire.

293
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:06,565
- Gross.
- Where are they?

294
00:46:06,692 --> 00:46:10,309
If they didn't get blown away
they're probably hunting.

295
00:46:10,445 --> 00:46:15,950
What good will that do? They can't cook
pigs without a fire. They'll get trichinosis.

296
00:46:16,076 --> 00:46:19,527
- What's that?
- It's bugs that live in pigs.

297
00:46:21,706 --> 00:46:23,746
We knew that.

298
00:49:13,122 --> 00:49:17,251
What's this shit about a monster?
We'll send you back to kindergarten.

299
00:49:17,377 --> 00:49:20,827
- I'm serious.
- OK, what kind of monster?

300
00:49:20,963 --> 00:49:25,174
Did it have fur and poisoned fangs,
or long, slimy tentacles?

301
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:29,595
It growled and it came out at me.
And its mouth, it was wet.

302
00:49:29,722 --> 00:49:32,888
- Maybe it was a bear.
- Sounds more like a reptile.

303
00:49:33,017 --> 00:49:35,971
Sounds more like bullshit.

304
00:50:29,237 --> 00:50:31,610
- We heard it all right.
- Yeah.

305
00:50:31,741 --> 00:50:34,612
Whatever it is, it's in there.

306
00:50:55,598 --> 00:50:59,131
You should have seen it.
He was scared shitless.

307
00:50:59,266 --> 00:51:03,976
Do you think there was something there?
Some kind of wild animal or something?

308
00:51:04,105 --> 00:51:08,517
- I know it. We heard it growl.
- Is it close?

309
00:51:08,651 --> 00:51:12,649
Just over the big rise
behind our camp. Real close.

310
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:14,820
Holy shit.

311
00:51:17,743 --> 00:51:21,242
- I just thought you ought to know.
- Yeah.

312
00:51:22,790 --> 00:51:25,459
Thanks for the fire.

313
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:35,712
Here come the reserves.

314
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:40,764
- Better keep on your toes tonight.
- What do you mean?

315
00:51:40,891 --> 00:51:43,595
- You'll find out.
- What are you doing with that?

316
00:51:43,726 --> 00:51:48,139
Next time we kill a pig,
we're gonna have a barbecue.

317
00:51:49,982 --> 00:51:54,728
- You mean no one's on fire watch?
- Why can't we have the fire down here?

318
00:51:54,863 --> 00:51:58,114
If we want anybody to see the smoke
it's gotta be up there.

319
00:51:58,242 --> 00:52:00,778
Nobody wants to be
up there alone any more.

320
00:52:00,909 --> 00:52:04,279
There's something loose
on this island - a monster.

321
00:52:04,413 --> 00:52:07,284
- There's no monster.
- There's something.

322
00:52:08,459 --> 00:52:12,456
- So what do you want?
- Jack wants the survival knife.

323
00:52:12,588 --> 00:52:14,627
It's not his. It belongs to the camp.

324
00:52:14,756 --> 00:52:17,960
Yeah? Well, there's a new camp now,
and he wants it.

325
00:52:18,094 --> 00:52:21,011
Yeah, and Tony wants his shoes,
socks and his junk.

326
00:52:21,139 --> 00:52:23,759
Take Tony's stuff
but you can't have the knife.

327
00:52:23,891 --> 00:52:29,134
- He's a defector. Another damn defector.
- It's because of the monster.

328
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:32,721
I told you there's no monster.
Tony knows there's no monster.

329
00:52:32,857 --> 00:52:37,020
Tony just wants to be a hunter
and he's too chickenshit to get his stuff.

330
00:52:37,153 --> 00:52:39,775
But what if there is
some kind of big animal?

331
00:52:39,907 --> 00:52:41,567
Yeah.

332
00:52:56,130 --> 00:52:59,880
Oh, great. Two more traitors.

333
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:02,298
Sorry, Ralph.

334
00:53:02,428 --> 00:53:05,132
Good riddance.

335
00:53:45,429 --> 00:53:47,053
Sh.

336
00:54:05,030 --> 00:54:08,613
Go on! Get the knife! Get the knife!

337
00:54:14,707 --> 00:54:17,542
Bring that back!
You have no right!

338
00:54:17,668 --> 00:54:22,412
Get back here! What the hell
do you think you're doing?

339
00:54:34,684 --> 00:54:37,056
Oh, God!

340
00:54:37,186 --> 00:54:40,768
They broke my glasses.

341
00:55:19,812 --> 00:55:23,558
Anyone who wants to come up has to ask.

342
00:55:23,689 --> 00:55:26,476
- Where are the others?
- They're hunting.

343
00:55:27,735 --> 00:55:30,571
Where's that cave you found?

344
00:55:32,825 --> 00:55:35,659
- Don't you know?
- Yeah, but I'm not going back.

345
00:55:35,785 --> 00:55:39,153
- I already showed Jack and the others.
- Tell me where it is.

346
00:55:39,288 --> 00:55:41,281
You shouldn't go there.

347
00:55:41,415 --> 00:55:45,115
I just want to look. I've got a glow stick.

348
00:55:46,712 --> 00:55:49,583
It's over there in the forest.

349
00:56:18,410 --> 00:56:21,079
Put it here.

350
00:56:29,002 --> 00:56:31,874
Sharpen a stick at both ends.

351
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:16,292
This is a present for the monster.

352
00:58:42,383 --> 00:58:45,502
OK, Rambo, you've made your point.
What do you want?

353
00:58:45,636 --> 00:58:48,387
We killed a pig today.
There's going to be a feast.

354
00:58:48,513 --> 00:58:51,348
You can all come eat
with us if you want to.

355
00:58:51,475 --> 00:58:56,765
- Go on. Now.
- The chief has spoken.

356
00:58:56,896 --> 00:58:58,936
See you tonight, girls.

357
01:00:02,376 --> 01:00:04,453
Count.
Cadence delay. Cadence count.

358
01:00:04,587 --> 01:00:08,122
- Whoa, one.
- Airborne rangers!

359
01:00:08,258 --> 01:00:09,800
- Two.
- Better do your best!

360
01:00:09,926 --> 01:00:11,550
- Three.
- Or you'll find yourself...

361
01:00:11,677 --> 01:00:13,255
- Four.
- In front leaving rest.

362
01:00:13,387 --> 01:00:14,087
- One.
- Hit it.

363
01:00:14,222 --> 01:00:14,921
- Two.
- Hit it.

364
01:00:15,056 --> 01:00:15,802
- Three.
- Hit it.

365
01:00:15,932 --> 01:00:16,631
- Four.
- Hit it.

366
01:00:16,766 --> 01:00:19,851
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.

367
01:00:19,978 --> 01:00:22,549
We like it here. We love it here.
We finally found a home.

368
01:00:22,687 --> 01:00:24,181
- A what?
- A home.

369
01:00:24,314 --> 01:00:28,443
- A what?
- A home away from home. Huh!

370
01:01:09,317 --> 01:01:12,152
Luke, take them some meat.

371
01:01:13,613 --> 01:01:16,068
I promised I'd get meat.

372
01:01:16,198 --> 01:01:18,238
Didn't I, Ralph?

373
01:01:19,201 --> 01:01:24,906
I want you to tell the little ones that
I made you a promise and I kept it. Say it!

374
01:01:25,039 --> 01:01:27,661
You kept your promise
but not the fire watch.

375
01:01:27,792 --> 01:01:32,954
You think one meal is worth not getting
rescued? We've gotta be one group again.

376
01:01:33,090 --> 01:01:36,506
I agree. You can join my camp
and have all the meat you want.

377
01:01:36,635 --> 01:01:39,256
We don't want your meat.

378
01:01:39,388 --> 01:01:42,008
Oh, yeah. Then why'd you come?

379
01:01:42,140 --> 01:01:45,058
We came to try
and talk some sense to you.

380
01:01:45,185 --> 01:01:47,757
You don't have the conch.

381
01:01:47,895 --> 01:01:50,600
The conch is in our camp,
where it belongs.

382
01:01:50,731 --> 01:01:54,184
What's the matter, tits?
Were you afraid to bring it with you?

383
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:56,987
- The conch doesn't count any more.
- Stop that!

384
01:01:57,112 --> 01:01:59,438
Nobody's interested in you
and your conch.

385
01:01:59,573 --> 01:02:05,778
Take your fat friend and shove off.
You've had all the meat you can eat.

386
01:02:05,914 --> 01:02:08,285
Come on, hunters!

387
01:02:09,917 --> 01:02:11,956
Roger's the pig!

388
01:04:19,166 --> 01:04:22,750
Come on, hunters! Billy's the monster!

389
01:04:49,321 --> 01:04:53,319
The monster!
It's the real monster! Kill him!

390
01:05:49,673 --> 01:05:52,542
What are we gonna do?

391
01:05:54,635 --> 01:05:58,383
Piggy, that was Simon.

392
01:06:00,558 --> 01:06:04,934
What good are you doing
talking about it? It was dark.

393
01:06:05,645 --> 01:06:08,766
- We were scared.
- I wasn't scared.

394
01:06:08,899 --> 01:06:12,766
You were scared.
Anything could have happened.

395
01:06:16,114 --> 01:06:18,321
It wasn't our fault.

396
01:06:18,450 --> 01:06:22,946
It was. We were there
and we didn't do anything about it.

397
01:06:23,079 --> 01:06:27,491
There was nothing we could do.
There was too many of them.

398
01:06:27,625 --> 01:06:31,042
- That's not the point.
- It was an accident.

399
01:06:31,171 --> 01:06:34,670
That's what it was - a terrible accident.

400
01:06:46,268 --> 01:06:48,307
- Hi.
- Hi.

401
01:06:50,815 --> 01:06:53,567
We came here to see
if you guys have any fire.

402
01:06:53,693 --> 01:06:55,731
Ours is out.

403
01:06:57,904 --> 01:07:01,819
- Everything's out.
- On account of the storm.

404
01:07:04,870 --> 01:07:07,740
We gotta get back.

405
01:07:09,249 --> 01:07:11,657
Hold on a minute.

406
01:07:11,793 --> 01:07:14,463
I wanna talk to you about last night.

407
01:07:14,588 --> 01:07:15,868
Ralph.

408
01:07:18,091 --> 01:07:20,629
We left early.

409
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:23,631
We were real tired.

410
01:07:38,653 --> 01:07:41,108
- It isn't fair.
- I never touched it.

411
01:07:41,239 --> 01:07:43,776
- He didn't.
- Butt out, or you'll get it.

412
01:07:43,907 --> 01:07:48,119
From now on, any more criminals
are gonna be put on that island to starve.

413
01:07:48,244 --> 01:07:52,242
- Give it to him. Whip him.
- Now you're gonna get it.

414
01:07:52,374 --> 01:07:54,414
Yeah!

415
01:08:16,857 --> 01:08:21,767
I'll get fire, I promise you.
Tomorrow we'll hunt again.

416
01:08:21,903 --> 01:08:25,604
But we have to be careful
cos the monster might come any time.

417
01:08:25,740 --> 01:08:27,733
But didn't we... I thought we...

418
01:08:27,867 --> 01:08:31,733
No. It could come again any time,
in any shape.

419
01:08:31,870 --> 01:08:35,453
Just when we're not ready,
it could be there.

420
01:08:59,857 --> 01:09:04,399
Maybe we should
just build a raft and row off.

421
01:09:05,778 --> 01:09:09,112
I will if you will.

422
01:09:11,701 --> 01:09:16,362
- Well?
- We don't really know what's out there.

423
01:09:16,496 --> 01:09:20,198
I bet you out past the reef
lots of boats come by every day,

424
01:09:20,335 --> 01:09:22,458
and one of them could rescue us.

425
01:09:22,587 --> 01:09:26,501
Yeah? Well, suppose it didn't.
Suppose it was Russian.

426
01:09:26,632 --> 01:09:29,384
Then what? We'd be taken prisoner.

427
01:09:29,510 --> 01:09:32,546
The Russians wouldn't take us prisoner.

428
01:09:32,679 --> 01:09:36,178
I don't know. Major Dingledine,
my new dad, told me...

429
01:09:36,307 --> 01:09:38,384
Major Dingledine?

430
01:09:38,518 --> 01:09:42,184
Yeah. He said that if
the Russians invaded the US,

431
01:09:42,315 --> 01:09:47,225
they would take the kids
and separate us from our parents -

432
01:09:48,152 --> 01:09:50,394
and I know it sounds weird -

433
01:09:50,530 --> 01:09:56,200
but they might make us go into
the Olympics or something like that.

434
01:09:57,119 --> 01:09:59,871
- I don't see what's so funny.
- Piggy,

435
01:09:59,998 --> 01:10:04,707
I don't think you have to worry about the
Russians forcing you into the Olympics.

436
01:10:12,176 --> 01:10:14,928
Hey, what's that?

437
01:10:52,173 --> 01:10:54,842
Where do you think it comes from?

438
01:10:54,968 --> 01:10:59,595
A Russian submarine,
full of Olympic athletes.

439
01:11:40,679 --> 01:11:43,347
Ralph, wake up.

440
01:11:45,808 --> 01:11:48,645
- What is it?
- Sh. Just listen.

441
01:11:48,771 --> 01:11:51,938
There's someone out there.

442
01:11:55,192 --> 01:11:58,359
- I don't hear anything.
- Sh. Listen.

443
01:12:06,078 --> 01:12:09,031
I hear you there, Piggy.

444
01:12:09,164 --> 01:12:12,616
Come outside, Piggy. I want you, Piggy.

445
01:12:13,711 --> 01:12:16,284
Ha, Piggy!

446
01:12:16,422 --> 01:12:19,376
Come on out, Piggy.

447
01:12:28,349 --> 01:12:31,684
Why can't you just leave us alone?

448
01:12:31,812 --> 01:12:33,935
Yagh!

449
01:12:34,065 --> 01:12:36,389
- Give 'em back!
- I got the glasses!

450
01:13:07,846 --> 01:13:09,673
Here.

451
01:13:25,447 --> 01:13:30,404
We did everything just the way
grown-ups would have.

452
01:13:30,534 --> 01:13:33,204
Why didn't it work?

453
01:13:34,665 --> 01:13:39,707
Things'd be much better, Ralph,
if it wasn't for him.

454
01:13:39,836 --> 01:13:42,754
I wish he was dead.

455
01:13:43,464 --> 01:13:46,833
- No, you don't.
- I do.

456
01:13:50,763 --> 01:13:56,103
We could just give up and join his tribe.

457
01:13:56,228 --> 01:13:59,513
Then we'd at least be with the others.

458
01:13:59,647 --> 01:14:02,054
No, Piggy.

459
01:14:02,733 --> 01:14:06,517
Ralph, I can't see.

460
01:14:08,072 --> 01:14:10,444
I know.

461
01:14:39,269 --> 01:14:41,843
Halt! Who goes there?

462
01:14:41,980 --> 01:14:44,553
Don't be stupid.
You know who we are.

463
01:14:44,691 --> 01:14:47,263
We brought the conch.
I'm calling an assembly.

464
01:14:47,401 --> 01:14:50,355
- Where's Jack?
- What do you want now?

465
01:14:50,488 --> 01:14:54,153
You heard. We brought the conch.
I'm calling an assembly.

466
01:14:54,283 --> 01:14:59,408
Why don't you two fuck off? This is my
end and my tribe. Keep to your own end.

467
01:14:59,538 --> 01:15:03,868
You won't keep to your end, tearing up
our camp and stealing Piggy's glasses.

468
01:15:04,001 --> 01:15:06,836
- You've gotta give 'em back.
- Got to? Who says?

469
01:15:06,962 --> 01:15:09,002
I do.

470
01:15:10,257 --> 01:15:14,337
Piggy can't see. If you wanted to have
a fire all you had to do was ask.

471
01:15:14,470 --> 01:15:18,846
- I don't have to ask!
- Come on! Yeah! Yeah!

472
01:16:03,183 --> 01:16:07,892
- I've got the conch. Let me speak.
- Get outta here, Piggy.

473
01:16:13,986 --> 01:16:16,691
Stop that, Roger. Let Piggy speak.

474
01:16:19,699 --> 01:16:23,281
Please. This is serious.

475
01:16:23,410 --> 01:16:27,575
Get out, fat ass. Get away.
Go back to your own camp.

476
01:16:29,543 --> 01:16:31,701
What I wanna say is,

477
01:16:31,836 --> 01:16:36,996
if we don't get rescued
we might have to live here for a long time.

478
01:16:38,134 --> 01:16:41,087
Maybe the rest of our lives.

479
01:16:42,929 --> 01:16:49,183
If we are stuck here until we get old
then we can't go on acting like kids.

480
01:16:50,564 --> 01:16:53,812
We've gotta be sensible
and make things work.

481
01:16:53,940 --> 01:16:55,600
No!

482
01:17:25,596 --> 01:17:28,466
You're not gonna get away with this.

483
01:17:28,599 --> 01:17:32,550
Yeah? And what are you gonna do? Huh?

484
01:17:32,688 --> 01:17:35,937
What are you gonna do about it?

485
01:17:36,065 --> 01:17:39,564
You're out of it, pal. You're on your own.

486
01:18:32,703 --> 01:18:34,743
About time.

487
01:18:34,873 --> 01:18:37,364
- You guys by yourselves?
- Yep.

488
01:18:37,501 --> 01:18:42,161
- Listen, you two, you have to stay awake.
- Give us a break.

489
01:18:42,295 --> 01:18:45,914
What do you think? You have to be 11
or you can't stand a watch?

490
01:18:46,049 --> 01:18:48,291
Just stay awake.

491
01:18:53,932 --> 01:18:57,977
What's the big deal?
There's nobody left except Ralph.

492
01:18:58,103 --> 01:19:01,222
They're scared of the monster.

493
01:19:01,356 --> 01:19:05,769
You said we didn't believe
in the monster. You said.

494
01:19:07,279 --> 01:19:10,113
I'm pretty sure we don't.

495
01:19:37,266 --> 01:19:39,473
Sam! Eric!

496
01:19:39,602 --> 01:19:41,678
It's me.

497
01:19:41,813 --> 01:19:44,101
You shouldn't be around here, Ralph.

498
01:19:44,231 --> 01:19:47,813
You're not allowed. The hunters
are gonna come after you.

499
01:19:47,943 --> 01:19:53,612
Yeah. And Jack had Roger
sharpen his stick at both ends.

500
01:19:53,740 --> 01:19:58,154
If that happens, it'll be
because you let it happen.

501
01:19:58,287 --> 01:20:03,328
If you don't stand up to him
you're just another one of his slaves.

502
01:20:03,457 --> 01:20:06,791
Hey, keep alert down there!

503
01:20:38,867 --> 01:20:43,281
Light another one.
We gotta smoke him out.

504
01:20:53,423 --> 01:20:55,665
He's over here!

505
01:22:41,736 --> 01:22:44,108
See anything over there?

506
01:22:44,238 --> 01:22:45,401
No.

507
01:22:45,531 --> 01:22:47,857
Nothing.

508
01:23:11,933 --> 01:23:13,557
Jack!

509
01:23:14,644 --> 01:23:17,395
Get him!

510
01:24:38,392 --> 01:24:41,262
What are you guys doing?

511
01:29:41,644 --> 01:29:44,727
