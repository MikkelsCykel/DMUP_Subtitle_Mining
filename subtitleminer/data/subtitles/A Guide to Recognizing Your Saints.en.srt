Uh.

Dito.

3
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:01,458
Uh.

4
00:01:02,461 --> 00:01:04,292
Oh, my goodness.

5
00:01:04,363 --> 00:01:08,322
I can't believe
to hear your voice
on this machine.

6
00:01:09,034 --> 00:01:10,592
It's your mother.

7
00:01:13,005 --> 00:01:16,168
Dito, I called
your friend Nerf to call you.

8
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:18,642
He's a good kid.
Uh--

9
00:01:21,013 --> 00:01:22,412
I don't know
what else to do.

10
00:01:22,481 --> 00:01:24,608
Your father's sick.
He's real sick,

11
00:01:24,683 --> 00:01:27,151
and he won't go
to the hospital.
You know how he is,

12
00:01:27,219 --> 00:01:31,121
and I'm sorry.
I don't know
what else to do.

13
00:01:33,125 --> 00:01:35,184
Your friend Nerf, uh,

14
00:01:35,928 --> 00:01:40,331
he's a good kid, you know.
He said he'd pick you up
at the airport if you came.

15
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,364
I know that it's far.

16
00:01:44,303 --> 00:01:46,032
I'm sorry.

17
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:50,199
I, uh--

18
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:52,836
I'm gonna hang up
now, Dito.

19
00:01:52,912 --> 00:01:54,243
Okay.
I love you.

20
00:01:54,313 --> 00:01:57,544
No matter what you do,
I love you.

<i>his brother Antonio</i>
<i>used to call him "Little Sister"</i>

26
00:03:14,326 --> 00:03:17,659

<i>on his face every night.</i>

27
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:21,166
<i>It never even made sense,</i>
<i>being everything else</i>
<i>about him was a mess.</i>

28
00:03:21,233 --> 00:03:24,202
<i>Well, he loved</i>

<i>What a mess, huh?</i>

34
00:03:38,183 --> 00:03:43,485

I feel I gotta tell you this
up front but I do.

35
00:03:43,555 --> 00:03:45,887
And don't worry, like,

36
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:51,659
I'm not giving away
any big ending, you know,
with this.

37
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:54,358
A whole lot of other shit's
gotta happen first.

38
00:03:57,403 --> 00:04:00,634
But I just, uh,
I wanna remember

39
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:05,435
who these people are
and what they meant to me.

40

What they mean to me.

41
00:04:08,847 --> 00:04:11,338
And they are real.

42

They got the Golden Gloves
coming up.

103
00:07:49,568 --> 00:07:51,502
The only thing
you'll ever box
is oranges.

104
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:54,403
Dad, this is serious.
They got bags and everything.

105
00:07:54,473 --> 00:07:55,770
It's cheap.
$10.

106

$10. Where you guys
gonna get $10 from?

107
00:07:58,477 --> 00:08:00,069
It's just $10.

108

<i>You guys wanna be</i>
<i>Golden Gloves?</i>
<i>You learn from the best.</i>

109
00:08:02,848 --> 00:08:06,181
Up from the waist,
down from the chin.
That's Golden Gloves.

110
00:08:06,251 --> 00:08:08,276
Okay.
Stop it already.
Seriously.

111

<i>if I was five years old.</i>
<i>Stop it.</i>

115
00:08:17,362 --> 00:08:19,091
The joke is five years old.

116
00:08:19,164 --> 00:08:20,654
Antonio, how old
is this guy?

117
00:08:20,732 --> 00:08:22,996
He's serious.
I don't know
how old he is.

118
00:08:23,068 --> 00:08:25,696
What happened to your nose?
It's bleeding.

119
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:28,103
It's my father.
He's stupid.
Whatever.

120
00:08:28,173 --> 00:08:30,300
Don't say that
about your father.

121
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:33,867
Hand him a dish rag.
Wipe his nose there.
What's the matter with him?

122
00:08:34,546 --> 00:08:36,480
<i>Are you alright?</i>
<i>Are you getting a job?</i>

123

Yeah, for sure.

Yeah, you're not doing anything.

126
00:08:42,521 --> 00:08:45,752
You wanna be boxers.
Forget about
these Golden Gloves.

127
00:08:45,824 --> 00:08:48,452
<i>You wanna learn?</i>
<i>You come to me,</i>

And the king
sits right here.

129
00:08:51,029 --> 00:08:53,896
Monty's throne, right?
Monty's throne.

130
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:56,230
I'm the king.

131

Are gonna get up?
What?

133
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:02,467

<i>Where you going?</i>
<i>What's the matter with him?</i>

139

Thank you very much.
I appreciate it very much.

143

Thank you very much.

145
00:09:26,531 --> 00:09:29,625
That kid doesn't say
two words.
It scares me that kid.

146
00:09:29,701 --> 00:09:32,499
Antonio?
Tonight I want you
to come back.

147
00:09:32,571 --> 00:09:35,802
<i>I want you to have dinner</i>

00:09:40,579 --> 00:09:41,944
Yeah.

151
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:43,872
They're alright.

152
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:46,683
They're alright.

153
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,146
Good dancing.

154
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:52,554
Look who we got here.

155
00:09:52,624 --> 00:09:54,956
Oh, shit!
Friggin' pistachio dick.

156
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:56,119
<i>Look at these girls.</i>

157
00:09:56,194 --> 00:09:57,855
It curves like a banana, right?

158
00:09:57,929 --> 00:10:00,227
No, like a pistachio.

159
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:02,199
Do you want some?
You.

160
00:10:16,581 --> 00:10:18,845
<i>It's as hot</i>
<i>as a fuckin' oven in here.</i>

161
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:30,392
Get the fuck off me!
It's like 250 degrees.
Get off me.

162
00:10:30,462 --> 00:10:33,556
I feel like a piece
of roast beef.

163
00:10:33,632 --> 00:10:36,226
But look at me.
I'm fuckin' sticky.
Look at me.

164
00:10:36,301 --> 00:10:37,962
So?

165
00:10:38,036 --> 00:10:42,632
Fuckin' landlord's
got the fuckin' radiators on
in the summer.

166
00:10:44,509 --> 00:10:47,376
You better not fuckin'
cum in me.

167
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:52,641
No!

168
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:54,709
Don't fuck.

169
00:10:54,786 --> 00:10:58,483
You better not fuckin'
cum in me.

170
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:05,658
Fuck!

171
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:06,857
What the fuck?

172
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:08,991
Fuckin' radiator burned me
and shit!

173
00:11:09,067 --> 00:11:10,659
Fuck me.

174
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:11,794
Come here.

175
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:15,135
You want me to come over there
and give you a hug
or some shit?

176
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:16,902
<i>I don't want you</i>
<i>to fuckin' hug me.</i>

177
00:11:16,975 --> 00:11:20,877
Look what we got here.
You guys are two
naughty fuckers.

178
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:22,174
Who the fuck is this guy?

179
00:11:22,247 --> 00:11:23,646
<i>My little retarded sister.</i>

180
00:11:23,715 --> 00:11:26,240
You're the bitch
who works at the pool
with Diane.

181
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:28,650
I just got done
fuckin' her.

182
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,187
Get the fuck
out of here.

183
00:11:30,255 --> 00:11:34,385
I'm virile and I'm virile
and I'm virile,
and I'm ready to do that shit.

184
00:11:34,459 --> 00:11:36,654
I just stole this dildo
from Mrs. Duran's,

185
00:11:36,728 --> 00:11:40,095
and I was wondering
you go into that shit, baby?
Two on one action?

186
00:11:40,165 --> 00:11:41,962
All I'm saying,
if I was an ugly bitch

187
00:11:42,033 --> 00:11:45,560
and two hot studs like this
wanted to fuck me,
I'd be into it.

188
00:11:45,637 --> 00:11:48,401
I'm taking a shit
and I'm out.

189
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:16,698
What are you thinking about?

190
00:12:16,768 --> 00:12:18,599
I don't know.

191
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:25,006
You're really beautiful,
you know.

192
00:12:25,076 --> 00:12:27,067
Thank you.

193
00:12:34,319 --> 00:12:36,150
Are you pushing?

194
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,358
Do you wanna kiss me?

195
00:12:44,696 --> 00:12:46,891
Do you wanna kiss me?

196
00:12:46,965 --> 00:12:49,695
For sure.
Kiss you.

197
00:12:51,102 --> 00:12:52,933
Fuck you.

198
00:12:53,004 --> 00:12:55,939
I'm sorry.
I just, just wanna fuck you,
you know.

199
00:12:56,007 --> 00:12:57,372
Alright.

200
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:01,441
Alright?

201
00:13:01,513 --> 00:13:04,346
No.
You're bugging, man.

202
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:08,682
I don't know
why I said that.
I wanna fuck you, you know.

203
00:13:08,753 --> 00:13:10,584
I wanna fuck you, too.

204
00:13:11,356 --> 00:13:13,847
I do.
I really do.

205
00:13:13,925 --> 00:13:14,949
For real?

206
00:13:15,026 --> 00:13:16,425
For real.

207
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:21,295
<i>Class, this is Michael O'Shea.</i>
<i>He's a new student.</i>

208
00:13:21,366 --> 00:13:24,335
<i>He just moved here</i>
<i>this winter from Ireland.</i>

209
00:13:24,402 --> 00:13:28,304
And besides making music,
Michael wants to be a writer
just like his father.

210
00:13:28,373 --> 00:13:32,207
On his first day here,
he wants to read a poem
about America.

211
00:13:32,277 --> 00:13:34,507
<i>Here you go.</i>

212
00:13:35,947 --> 00:13:40,213
My name's Michael O'Shea,
and I'm from Scotland.

213
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:46,554
Uh. My father says
poems don't always
have to rhyme.

214
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:47,683
This one doesn't.

215
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:55,967
<i>My New friend.</i>
<i>I know he likes me,</i>
<i>but I think he needs me.</i>

216
00:13:56,034 --> 00:14:01,097
<i>I definitely need him, too.</i>
<i>This is a scary place</i>
<i>sometimes.</i>

217
00:14:01,172 --> 00:14:02,696
But my new friend,
he needs me

218
00:14:02,774 --> 00:14:06,938
<i>because together</i>
<i>we're not like everybody else.</i>

219
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:09,207
<i>That was very nice, Michael.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

220
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:12,045
<i>Okay, class, let's turn</i>
<i>to page 64, please.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

221
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,020
It's hot as shit out here.

222
00:14:18,189 --> 00:14:19,656
What the fuck
you looking at?

223
00:14:19,724 --> 00:14:22,659
Don't even fuckin' try
that shit.

224
00:14:22,727 --> 00:14:24,160
Want some gum?

225
00:14:26,631 --> 00:14:29,099
<i>Yo, did you really take</i>
<i>a shit in there?</i>

226
00:14:29,167 --> 00:14:30,600
<i>What is wrong with you?</i>

227
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:33,001
You smell
like open ass, man.

228
00:14:36,474 --> 00:14:38,999
<i>Hey!</i>
<i>Hey, old bitch.</i>

229
00:14:39,077 --> 00:14:41,841
Hey, hey.
Hey, put your ass here.

230
00:14:44,182 --> 00:14:45,410
Go ahead.

231
00:14:45,483 --> 00:14:49,283
Nice dress.
Fuckin' looking
like a cheetah.

232
00:14:49,354 --> 00:14:52,221
<i>Clean that shit up!</i>

233
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:54,884
What?
Fucker!

234
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,757
What the fuck
is wrong with you, man?

235
00:14:56,828 --> 00:14:59,126
Clean your shit up
and tell him to fuck off!

236
00:14:59,197 --> 00:15:02,428
Police'll be here
in five minutes.

237
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,900
Antonio, come on.

238
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,301
No, no, no, no.

239
00:15:06,371 --> 00:15:07,269
<i>Wait, wait.</i>

240
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:10,831
Open the door, man.
Hey, come on,
open the fuckin' door!

241
00:15:10,909 --> 00:15:13,469
Yo, meet me
at the park, alright?

242
00:15:13,545 --> 00:15:15,536
Meet me at the park.

243
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:17,980
You fucker.
You better fuckin' flinch.

244
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:41,400
<i>You're the new kid</i>
<i>from my class, right?</i>
<i>From Ireland.</i>

245
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:43,236
<i>Scotland.</i>

246
00:15:43,308 --> 00:15:46,800
<i>We came and lived</i>
<i>in Manhattan for a bit</i>
<i>but now, yeah.</i>

247
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:51,713
<i>Fucking crazy there, right?</i>

248
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:55,077
<i>I'm Dito.</i>

249
00:15:55,153 --> 00:15:57,144
I'm, uh, I'm Dito.

250
00:15:57,222 --> 00:15:59,383
<i>Mick.</i>
<i>Uhm, Mike.</i>

251
00:15:59,457 --> 00:16:02,119
Mick.
Uhm, Mike.

252
00:16:03,962 --> 00:16:07,989
<i>And then Giuseppe was the kid</i>
<i>climbing on the window.</i>
<i>The church, the roof.</i>

253
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:13,863
My friend, he was running naked
on the-- you remember that?
On the roof?

254
00:16:13,938 --> 00:16:14,996
<i>He was funny.</i>

255
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:17,869
<i>Where you going?</i>

256
00:16:19,544 --> 00:16:21,444
<i>Just got bored,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

257
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:23,447
<i>Kind of ride</i>
<i>the subway around.</i>

258
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:25,676
<i>Back and forth,</i>
<i>and back and forth.</i>

259
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,344
<i>And back and forth.</i>
<i>Back and forth.</i>

260
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:29,945
<i>Stupid thing.</i>

261
00:16:30,021 --> 00:16:31,181
Just back and forth?

262
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:32,621
<i>Yeah.</i>

263
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:36,584
<i>I was gonna ride it</i>
<i>to Coney Island or something.</i>

264
00:16:36,661 --> 00:16:40,153
<i>Go there</i>
<i>and I don't know,</i>
<i>ride back.</i>

265
00:16:40,231 --> 00:16:43,689
I was thinking about going
to Coney Island, you know.

266
00:16:44,569 --> 00:16:46,764
<i>Yeah, 'cause I've never been.</i>

267
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,238
<i>You've never been?</i>

268
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:53,772
<i>No. I went to the zoo once</i>
<i>but that was like</i>
<i>in the Bronx or something.</i>

269
00:16:53,845 --> 00:16:54,834
It's not really--

270
00:16:54,913 --> 00:16:56,938
That's not traveling.

271
00:16:57,015 --> 00:16:59,313
<i>It sucks, too.</i>
<i>There's nothing really there.</i>

272
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,748
What are you looking at?

273
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:05,153
That dot.

274
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:09,753
<i>Close one eye like this.</i>

275
00:17:10,762 --> 00:17:12,593
<i>Fly right over it.</i>

276
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,694
<i>Oh, shit.</i>
<i>I got it.</i>

277
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:33,277
<i>You want China?</i>

278
00:17:33,351 --> 00:17:35,148
<i>That's what they got</i>
<i>Chinatown for.</i>

279
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:39,657
You want Italy?
You go to Georgie.
Where's the Italians they go?

280
00:17:39,724 --> 00:17:41,089
Mulberry Street.

281
00:17:41,159 --> 00:17:42,183
<i>Little Italy.</i>

282
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:46,196
Wanna go to Puerto Rico?
Go uptown. There's
Puerto Ricans everywhere.

283
00:17:46,264 --> 00:17:48,391
You know what Antonio
just told me?

284
00:17:48,466 --> 00:17:51,230
<i>That there's wild dogs</i>
<i>in Italy, right?</i>
<i>Who needs that?</i>

285
00:17:51,302 --> 00:17:52,360
Not me.

286
00:17:52,437 --> 00:17:54,234
I don't wanna be there.

287
00:17:56,274 --> 00:17:57,741
How are you?
Nice seeing you.

288
00:17:57,809 --> 00:17:59,538
Uncle George,
how you doing?

289
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:00,873
I'm just boiling.

290
00:18:00,945 --> 00:18:04,005
<i>It's summertime.</i>
<i>That's why you're boiling.</i>

291
00:18:04,082 --> 00:18:06,016
You want some juice?

292
00:18:06,084 --> 00:18:07,449
Where you been?

293
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:09,419
<i>I was in Coney Island.</i>

294
00:18:09,487 --> 00:18:11,250
<i>What were you doing there?</i>

295
00:18:11,322 --> 00:18:14,018
I was on the train.
I meet up with this guy
from school.

296
00:18:14,092 --> 00:18:17,619
<i>This Mike kid.</i>
<i>He's from Ireland.</i>
<i>Like from the country Ireland.</i>

297
00:18:17,695 --> 00:18:21,563
He was telling me about
how he wants to do some music,
like a band or something.

298
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:23,533
You just went
to Coney Island.

299
00:18:23,601 --> 00:18:26,069
Is it just me
or it's 100 degrees
in this house?

300
00:18:26,137 --> 00:18:29,903
<i>It's summer.</i>
<i>That's why it's hot.</i>
<i>Right, Antonio?</i>

301
00:18:29,974 --> 00:18:31,703
Yeah.
It's summer.

302
00:18:31,776 --> 00:18:33,334
It's, summer, baby.
It's hot.

303
00:18:33,411 --> 00:18:34,708
<i>What can I tell you?</i>

304
00:18:34,779 --> 00:18:40,445
Will you just stop teasing?
The heat's unbearable.
We gotta get a fan, Monty.

305
00:18:40,518 --> 00:18:41,883
We gotta get a fan.

306
00:18:41,953 --> 00:18:44,183
<i>Maria, you still there?</i>

307
00:18:44,255 --> 00:18:46,120
<i>I have to attach</i>
<i>this machine.</i>

308
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:49,456
<i>She's gonna set</i>
<i>this place on fire!</i>

309
00:18:49,527 --> 00:18:51,119
<i>Can I see</i>
<i>what's going on?</i>

310
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:54,324
<i>I brought the tape.</i>
<i>I brought the machine</i>
<i>to show you, Monty.</i>

311
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:56,026
<i>I don't care</i>
<i>about that machine.</i>

312
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,227
<i>You can play things</i>
<i>from the television.</i>

313
00:18:58,303 --> 00:18:59,531
So it's that machine.

314
00:18:59,604 --> 00:19:02,004
<i>Rewind that.</i>
<i>Let's see that again.</i>

315
00:19:02,073 --> 00:19:05,668
<i>Dito, where you going?</i>
<i>It's show time over here.</i>

316
00:19:05,743 --> 00:19:09,975
Are you expecting a date
with that girl?
That swimmer?

317
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:14,314
We heard from your friend
you have a girlfriend now, huh?
She's a swimmer?

318
00:19:14,385 --> 00:19:17,513
A Swimmer?
Who, Laurie?
She sells food at the pool.

319
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:19,648
Yeah, she sells food
at the pool.

320
00:19:19,724 --> 00:19:22,158
<i>That swimmer girl?</i>
<i>right, Antonio?</i>

321
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:23,888
<i>The swimmer girl.</i>

322
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:27,159
Uncle George,
she's not a swimmer.
She sells food at the pool.

323
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:28,324
That's what she does.

324
00:19:28,399 --> 00:19:31,425
What does she do?
Like races or marathons?

325
00:19:31,502 --> 00:19:34,232
Maybe it was the guy
from Coney Island.
The Irish guy.

326
00:19:34,305 --> 00:19:36,933
The guy who wants the band.
Right, Monty?

327
00:19:37,008 --> 00:19:38,339
<i>She's a swimmer.</i>

328
00:19:38,409 --> 00:19:40,843
<i>What's she doing at the pool</i>
<i>if she don't swim?</i>

329
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:47,818
<i>You have seven</i>
<i>new messages.</i>

330
00:19:48,386 --> 00:19:50,650
<i>Uh, Dito,</i>
<i>this is Nerf.</i>

331
00:19:51,322 --> 00:19:53,313
<i>Your old friend Nerf.</i>

332
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:57,390
<i>Monty's not,</i>
<i>not doing too good, man.</i>

333
00:19:57,462 --> 00:20:00,795
<i>I know Antonio called you</i>
<i>and, uh,</i>

334
00:20:02,033 --> 00:20:04,831
<i>you-- you're father's</i>
<i>real sick, man.</i>

335
00:20:06,137 --> 00:20:07,832
<i>Your mom called me</i>

336
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:13,003
<i>and... she really wants you</i>
<i>to come home, you know.</i>

337
00:20:13,077 --> 00:20:14,374
<i>So you should.</i>

338
00:20:14,445 --> 00:20:16,310
Hey, come back.

339
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:18,440
Fuck you!

340
00:20:18,516 --> 00:20:20,040
I hate those fucks!

341
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:21,107
<i>What are you doing?</i>

342
00:20:21,185 --> 00:20:23,278
Pay, thank.

343
00:20:23,354 --> 00:20:24,412
Oh, my God.

344
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:27,788
Chinese motherfucker
always staring me down!

345
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:30,327
<i>You pay.</i>

346
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:32,386
Why does your dad
calls us swimmers?

347
00:20:32,463 --> 00:20:33,953
'Cause you work
at a pool.

348
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:35,624
But I'm not a swimmer.

349
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:41,600
<i>You better tell Antonio</i>
<i>and his fucking brother</i>
<i>not to come around my house.</i>

350
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:43,334
I don't like that asshole.

351
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:44,898
Diane, don't worry
about it.

352
00:20:44,976 --> 00:20:48,537
He's a controlling little fuck!
I could tell
just by looking at him.

353
00:20:48,613 --> 00:20:50,205
<i>You're making it bigger.</i>

354
00:20:50,281 --> 00:20:52,977
Stop being crazy, alright?

355
00:20:53,051 --> 00:20:55,849
Is it just me
or does that nigger
seem retarded?

356
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:59,412
What the fuck are you doing?
That's my friend's
mother's store.

357
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:01,583
<i>That's the shit they wrote</i>
<i>on your housel</i>

358
00:21:01,659 --> 00:21:03,251
What the fuck
are you doing?

359
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:04,317
You got a problem?

360
00:21:04,395 --> 00:21:06,295
<i>Get off him right now.</i>
<i>I'm not playing.</i>

361
00:21:07,465 --> 00:21:09,865
<i>What the fuck?</i>
<i>Are you crazy?</i>
<i>Fucking bitch!</i>

362
00:21:09,934 --> 00:21:11,925
That's right, asshole.

363
00:21:12,003 --> 00:21:14,267
I don't have a problem.
Laurie, go get Antonio.

364
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:16,773
You need a bitch
to go get your man?

365
00:21:16,841 --> 00:21:19,708
I should fuckin' kill you!
I should fuckin' kill you.

366
00:21:19,777 --> 00:21:23,838
I'm gonna get you.
I got you, baby.
You stupid fuckin' bitch!

367
00:21:23,915 --> 00:21:25,712
You nappy motherfucker.

368
00:21:25,783 --> 00:21:27,114
I got you!

369
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,211
<i>Explain this to me.</i>

370
00:21:31,289 --> 00:21:33,450
<i>You and this swimmer</i>
<i>got into some trouble?</i>

371
00:21:33,524 --> 00:21:35,856
Mr. Montiel,
I don't even swim.

372
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:38,020
You don't swim.
Look at that eye.

373
00:21:38,096 --> 00:21:41,327
We collect tickets
where the food is
at the swimming pool.

374
00:21:41,399 --> 00:21:44,596
I'm thinking of quitting.
Maybe working
at the supermarket.

375
00:21:44,669 --> 00:21:47,103
It's just like
too many kids.

376
00:21:47,171 --> 00:21:48,468
Yeah, we care.

377
00:21:48,539 --> 00:21:50,302
<i>Fuck you, okay?</i>

378
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:53,708
Put this on your eye, alright?

379
00:21:53,778 --> 00:21:55,939
<i>I'm not putting meat</i>
<i>on my eye.</i>

380
00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:59,074
Get out of here.
I'm not putting that
on my face.

381
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:01,141
People used to do that
100 years ago.

382
00:22:01,219 --> 00:22:04,882
I just want to know
what's going on.
Tell me what happened.

383
00:22:04,956 --> 00:22:07,254
<i>Nothing's going on.</i>
<i>It's very simple.</i>

384
00:22:07,325 --> 00:22:09,725
What happened to your eye?

385
00:22:09,794 --> 00:22:11,887
I'm telling you,
nothing happened, okay?

386
00:22:11,963 --> 00:22:14,625
Some jerk was acting
like a wise guy.

387
00:22:14,699 --> 00:22:18,362
Daddy, some jerk was acting
like a wise guy.
That's it.

388
00:22:18,436 --> 00:22:19,767
That's it, okay?

389
00:22:19,837 --> 00:22:21,668
<i>You got cut a little bit.</i>

390
00:22:21,739 --> 00:22:23,604
He grabbed him
by the face
and cut him.

391
00:22:23,674 --> 00:22:27,303
Who grabbed him
by the face?
A Puerto Rican?

392
00:22:27,378 --> 00:22:30,176
The one that spray painted
all the graffiti outside.

393
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:32,842
A Puerto Rican did this?
Was it the Reaper guy?

394
00:22:32,917 --> 00:22:33,941
Please, stop it.

395
00:22:34,018 --> 00:22:37,749
Don't ask me to stop it.
This guy better worry now.
And I know where he is.

396
00:22:37,822 --> 00:22:40,347
<i>Nerf told me where they stay</i>
<i>down by Queensbridge.</i>

397
00:22:40,425 --> 00:22:44,953
Remember what I said.
Two shots.
Six inches, they go right down.

398
00:22:45,029 --> 00:22:46,826
Two shots?
Shit.

399
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:49,958
<i>Shut the fuck up.</i>
<i>I'm sorry, Monty.</i>
<i>I don't mean to be cursing.</i>

400
00:22:50,034 --> 00:22:52,832
That's enough, okay?
Hey!

401
00:22:55,873 --> 00:22:58,933
God gave me this mouth
so I can use it
and that's what I'm doing.

402
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:00,705
<i>Am I gonna have</i>
<i>to smack this girl?</i>

403
00:23:00,778 --> 00:23:02,473
She's just talking.

404
00:23:03,881 --> 00:23:05,473
Get the fuck
out of my way!

405
00:23:10,621 --> 00:23:13,055
<i>Yo, Yo,</i>
<i>get the fuck out!</i>

406
00:23:13,124 --> 00:23:16,491
<i>Hey, fuckin',</i>
<i>Nerf, where the fuck</i>
<i>did you get a car?</i>

407
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:19,428
My mother let me
take it out to practice
for my license.

408
00:23:19,497 --> 00:23:20,964
How'd your mother
get a car?

409
00:23:21,032 --> 00:23:23,159
I gotta practice
for my license.

410
00:23:23,234 --> 00:23:26,226
Hey, get off the car!
Get the fuck off my car!

411
00:23:26,304 --> 00:23:27,328
What the fuck?

412
00:23:27,405 --> 00:23:29,202
<i>Get in, get in.</i>
<i>Let's go.</i>

413
00:23:29,273 --> 00:23:31,332
<i>No, don't get in.</i>

414
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:33,172
I'm coming back.
I'm coming back.

415
00:23:33,244 --> 00:23:34,711
<i>You're gonna leave me, then?</i>

416
00:23:34,779 --> 00:23:36,178
This thing is huge!

417
00:23:36,247 --> 00:23:37,373
I'm coming back.

418
00:23:37,448 --> 00:23:39,712
<i>We're gonna go</i>
<i>around the block.</i>

419
00:23:39,784 --> 00:23:41,479
What happened
to your face?

420
00:23:41,552 --> 00:23:43,679
They hit him in the face
with a bottle.

421
00:23:43,754 --> 00:23:48,123
Your graffiti friends
hit him with a bottle.
They fucked up your mom's store.

422
00:23:48,192 --> 00:23:50,057
Dito.

423
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:52,619
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>what you're talking about.</i>

424
00:23:52,697 --> 00:23:54,187
Take us down
to Queensbridge.

425
00:23:54,265 --> 00:23:55,892
I gotta take
the car back.

426
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:58,060
Take me down
to Queensbridge right now.

427
00:23:58,136 --> 00:23:59,330
No, I can't.

428
00:23:59,403 --> 00:24:01,428
Fuck it.
I'll drive.

429
00:24:01,506 --> 00:24:03,303
Alright.

430
00:24:03,374 --> 00:24:05,672
Shut up!

431
00:24:05,743 --> 00:24:09,304
<i>Are you gonna call me?</i>
<i>I'm gonna be on this corner.</i>
<i>You better call me, Dito.</i>

432
00:24:11,282 --> 00:24:14,046
<i>Your graffiti friends</i>
<i>hit him in the face</i>
<i>with a bottle.</i>

433
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:31,596
What, are you fuckin' stupid?

434
00:24:39,577 --> 00:24:40,908
What did you say?

435
00:24:40,978 --> 00:24:42,309
He's my brother.

436
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:50,018
You know the guy
that writes graffiti around here?

437
00:24:50,087 --> 00:24:52,055
<i>No hablo inglés.</i>

438
00:24:52,123 --> 00:24:55,024
<i>No habla fuckin' Inglés.</i>

439
00:24:57,128 --> 00:24:59,995
What the fuck
you doing out
so late, man?

440
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:05,234
<i>So you know the kids</i>
<i>that write graffiti</i>
<i>and shit, right?</i>

441
00:25:05,303 --> 00:25:06,600
How you know them?

442
00:25:07,738 --> 00:25:12,732
Because one of,
one of the members
are my brother.

443
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:14,141
Is your brother?

444
00:25:14,212 --> 00:25:16,578
Your bro-- brother?

445
00:25:18,816 --> 00:25:19,840
Reaper.

446
00:25:19,917 --> 00:25:21,111
Reaper?

447
00:25:22,186 --> 00:25:24,381
You see my friend
right there?

448
00:25:25,189 --> 00:25:26,850
<i>He's cut, right?</i>

449
00:25:26,924 --> 00:25:29,017
<i>Your brother did that.</i>

450
00:25:29,093 --> 00:25:33,530
<i>Yeah, he cut Dito.</i>
<i>Can you say that?</i>
<i>Can you say his name?</i>

451
00:25:33,598 --> 00:25:35,395
He cut Dito.

452
00:25:35,466 --> 00:25:37,991
You can tell him
Antonio came by?
Yeah?

453
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:39,559
<i>He's a little kid, man.</i>

454
00:25:39,637 --> 00:25:42,231
You can remember
to tell him that for me?
He cut Dito.

455
00:25:42,306 --> 00:25:45,605
I like this kid.
I like this kid.
I like him.

456
00:25:46,744 --> 00:25:50,510
<i>This kid's good.</i>
<i>Alright, I like this kid.</i>

457
00:25:50,581 --> 00:25:54,915
Are you fuckin' stupid?
What's wrong with you?
Let's get out of here!

458
00:25:54,986 --> 00:25:56,419
<i>Let's go.</i>
<i>Come on, let's go.</i>

459
00:25:56,487 --> 00:25:58,352
<i>I sent a little</i>
<i>fuckin' message.</i>

460
00:26:19,176 --> 00:26:20,939
Your father's not stupid.

461
00:26:23,781 --> 00:26:26,181
<i>I swear your father's</i>
<i>a good guy, man.</i>

462
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:28,775
<i>If anybody ever</i>
<i>fucked with him,</i>
<i>forget it.</i>

463
00:26:29,687 --> 00:26:31,552
<i>Antonio's not a well kid.</i>

464
00:26:31,622 --> 00:26:33,351
He shouldn't be
hanging out with him.

465
00:26:33,424 --> 00:26:34,789
He's a good kid.

466
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:35,883
No!

467
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,428
I was any different?
Come on, stop it.

468
00:26:38,496 --> 00:26:41,795
You were so much different.
You are a great father.

469
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:45,358
Not this guy's dad.
He beats him to a pulp.

470
00:26:54,445 --> 00:26:57,312
<i>He's a good guy, you know?</i>
<i>He's a good guy.</i>

471
00:27:39,123 --> 00:27:43,890
<i>That's right, motherfucker!</i>
<i>That's the song?</i>

472
00:27:43,961 --> 00:27:47,863
<i>That's right, motherfucker!</i>

473
00:27:47,932 --> 00:27:51,265
Man, I'm telling you,
your band's gonna be
fuckin' hardcore, man.

474
00:27:51,335 --> 00:27:53,599
Yo, Radioman,
what's up, my man?

475
00:27:53,671 --> 00:27:54,899
Who the fuck
is that guy?

476
00:27:54,972 --> 00:27:56,963
He's cool.
Your band has to be cool.

477
00:27:57,041 --> 00:28:02,570
We need to be like Black Flag,
Bad Brains, Urban Waste,
Major Conflict, all of them.

478
00:28:02,646 --> 00:28:04,705
Those bands rule.
That's fuckin' music.

479
00:28:04,782 --> 00:28:08,183
Our band needs to be cool.
We need a good name.

480
00:28:08,252 --> 00:28:09,276
For what?

481
00:28:09,353 --> 00:28:11,583
The band.
This is it.

482
00:28:11,655 --> 00:28:13,350
Right here?

483
00:28:13,424 --> 00:28:14,721
This is Frank?

484
00:28:14,792 --> 00:28:17,761
What's the deal with this Frank?
We can do the job together.

485
00:28:17,828 --> 00:28:21,025
Definitely.
He's going to go
on about Job.

486
00:28:21,098 --> 00:28:23,794
You know,
the guy from the Bible.
Just say you know.

487
00:28:24,602 --> 00:28:26,092
Which one's the job?

488
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:28,730
He's got like
everything going on, man.
He's cool.

489
00:28:28,806 --> 00:28:32,970
<i>I told him</i>
<i>you don't have to be a fag</i>
<i>to talk like a fag.</i>

490
00:28:33,043 --> 00:28:36,672
Therefore you don't
have to be a fag to have
your dogs walked by a fag.

491
00:28:36,747 --> 00:28:39,272
Watch the little one.
I gotta go, Raul.

492
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:43,810
I gotta call this pain in the ass
before it gets too late.

493
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,378
Yeah.

494
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:49,391
Oh, unbelievable.

495
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,155
Frank, this is Dito.

496
00:28:51,228 --> 00:28:53,253
Hi.

497
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:54,558
Okay.

498
00:28:54,632 --> 00:28:57,692
Mikey, there's $10
I owe you in dimes.
It's on the floor.

499
00:28:57,768 --> 00:29:00,828
Take it for train fares, okay?

500
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:02,338
<i>Yes?</i>

501
00:29:03,441 --> 00:29:06,137
Miss Levitt,
I was just gonna call you.

502
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:10,010
I would never take little Bobo
onto the subway.
Please!

503
00:29:10,848 --> 00:29:12,406
George, come here.
Come here!

504
00:29:14,318 --> 00:29:15,512
No, I'm serious.

505
00:29:15,586 --> 00:29:18,885
You gotta tell me
who would say things
like that about me.

506
00:29:21,258 --> 00:29:23,249
No.
Wha--

507
00:29:24,462 --> 00:29:27,522
I got somebody here.
Let me ask.
Listen, Hey!

508
00:29:27,598 --> 00:29:32,058
You know the video
of, uh, Lionel Richie
with the blind lady?

509
00:29:32,136 --> 00:29:33,296
<i>Hello.</i>

510
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:35,531
<i>Hello.</i>
Yes.

511
00:29:35,606 --> 00:29:38,268
She heard you.
I love that song, too.

512
00:29:40,244 --> 00:29:41,768
Yes.

513
00:29:41,846 --> 00:29:43,746
Yes, 9:00

514
00:29:43,814 --> 00:29:45,406
Thank you!

515
00:29:46,116 --> 00:29:48,346
Oh!
Nightmare!

516
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:51,388
Okay.
Let's go.
Come on.

517
00:29:52,156 --> 00:29:54,590
<i>I got Shakespeare.</i>
<i>Let's go, guys.</i>
<i>Come one.</i>

518
00:29:55,493 --> 00:29:57,188
Let's go.
Come on, come on!

519
00:29:57,895 --> 00:30:00,728
Come on.
Did you take the dimes
for the train fare?

520
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:03,392
Okay, let's go.
Come on.
And close the door.

521
00:30:03,467 --> 00:30:07,198
You see, they're insects.
Fuckin' horseflies
like animals in this place.

522
00:30:07,271 --> 00:30:10,172
<i>I don't want them</i>
<i>getting out.</i>
<i>Get George.</i>

523
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:13,802
Let's go.
That's it, come on.
Let's go, come on.

524
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:20,311
My good friend here says
your name is Titi
or Chiti or Rodito.

525
00:30:20,384 --> 00:30:21,783
Dito.

526
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,181
And you guys
are gonna do a band?

527
00:30:24,255 --> 00:30:25,449
Dito's gonna sing.

528
00:30:25,523 --> 00:30:28,151
Oh, how gay.
I mean, great.

529
00:30:28,225 --> 00:30:30,989
Is this gonna be
like Lionel Richie
or you guys rock out?

530
00:30:31,061 --> 00:30:34,827
No, Frank.
We're gonna be hardcore
like Black Flag.

531
00:30:34,899 --> 00:30:37,800
One of my clients, Bobby,
he has the Pomeranian.

532
00:30:37,868 --> 00:30:41,599
He's an entertainment manager,
like music or something.

533
00:30:41,672 --> 00:30:44,664
I'll have you guys
walk his dog.
You never know, right?

534
00:30:44,742 --> 00:30:46,334
Hello there, Abigail.

535
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:49,243
Taking the dog out
for a drag again,
I see.

536
00:30:50,648 --> 00:30:54,175
She's too cheap
to pay the six bucks
for me to walk that thing.

537
00:30:54,251 --> 00:30:56,344
I mean, come on,
they're older than dirt.

538
00:30:56,987 --> 00:30:58,511
Frank, what's the job about?

539
00:30:58,589 --> 00:31:01,615
Miss Abigail needs
some hot young action,
right lovely?

540
00:31:01,692 --> 00:31:02,818
Come here.
George.

541
00:31:02,893 --> 00:31:05,157
She can't hear worth shit.

542
00:31:05,229 --> 00:31:08,289
You walk dogs
for half an hour
or until they crap.

543
00:31:08,365 --> 00:31:10,333
I charge them $6.
I give you $4.

544
00:31:10,401 --> 00:31:11,993
I thought we get $3.

545
00:31:12,703 --> 00:31:16,537
This is one honest
young man, this boy.
Like Job from the Bible.

546
00:31:16,607 --> 00:31:18,370
You know
who Job is, Condito?

547
00:31:18,442 --> 00:31:20,307
Yeah.
I already told him, Frank.

548
00:31:20,377 --> 00:31:23,346
You just got a raise then,
for the band.

549
00:31:23,414 --> 00:31:26,315
'Cause we walk dogs, you know?
You walk dogs.

550
00:31:26,383 --> 00:31:28,715
Whole wide world
walks fuckin' dogs.

551
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:32,311
Always carry paper.
Pretend you pick up the crap.

552
00:31:34,024 --> 00:31:35,355
<i>Ay!</i>

553
00:31:35,426 --> 00:31:37,951
How loud
is this freaking city.

554
00:32:08,993 --> 00:32:10,756
<i>Nerf.</i>

555
00:32:13,163 --> 00:32:14,152
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

556
00:32:14,231 --> 00:32:16,199
It's good to see you, man.
Really.

557
00:32:16,266 --> 00:32:17,858
<i>Thanks for picking me up.</i>

558
00:32:17,935 --> 00:32:21,268
Hey, no problem, man.
I couldn't believe it
when you called, dude.

559
00:32:22,006 --> 00:32:25,965
I still can't fucking' believe it,
but you're here, man.
It's fucked up, right?

560
00:32:26,043 --> 00:32:28,443
<i>It's been a long time,</i>
<i>and it's great to see you.</i>

561
00:32:28,512 --> 00:32:31,276
You bugged out
when Antonio called, huh?

562
00:32:31,348 --> 00:32:34,317
I still can't believe it, you know.
That's all.

563
00:32:34,385 --> 00:32:36,285
Guess who I saw
the other day?

564
00:32:36,353 --> 00:32:39,288
Fuckin' Laurie.
Your old fuckin' girl, right?

565
00:32:39,356 --> 00:32:42,484
Still up on Ditmars.
She's got a kid now.
Kid's a fuckin' rat.

566
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:45,426
<i>She's got a kid?</i>
<i>Who with?</i>

567
00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:46,622
I don't fuckin' know.

568
00:32:46,697 --> 00:32:48,631
<i>Not that Guido</i>
<i>who used to hit on her?</i>

569
00:32:48,699 --> 00:32:51,668
<i>Guido Tony!</i>
<i>No, no.</i>
<i>Fuckin' no.</i>

570
00:32:51,735 --> 00:32:54,898
That motherfucker
went to the army
or some shit.

571
00:32:54,972 --> 00:32:57,600
Maybe he invented something.
I don't really know.

572
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:04,308
<i>Hey, remember this place?</i>
<i>Greek Pancyprian Club.</i>

573
00:33:04,381 --> 00:33:05,871
Yo!

574
00:33:05,949 --> 00:33:09,976
<i>Uh, this place rock or disco?</i>

575
00:33:10,054 --> 00:33:11,783
<i>I hate that shit.</i>

576
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:14,522
<i>Fuckers.</i>

577
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:21,097
Uh, it's a full-on
Yuppie club now, man.
Unbelievable.

578
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:24,430
Better that way, though.
People always dress up
and shit.

579
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:28,130
It looks a little bit better
around here, you know.

580
00:33:29,006 --> 00:33:30,405
<i>Your mom's still here, huh?</i>

581
00:33:30,474 --> 00:33:31,668
<i>Yeah.</i>

582
00:33:33,343 --> 00:33:35,538
<i>But she's sleeping.</i>

583
00:33:35,612 --> 00:33:39,514
I mean, everybody says
I should get
my own place, but--

584
00:33:39,583 --> 00:33:44,020
I ain't got to pay rent.
You get free food.
For now, you know.

585
00:33:44,088 --> 00:33:47,023
<i>Thanks for letting me stay.</i>
<i>I can get a hotel</i>
<i>if you want.</i>

586
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:48,353
Hotel?

587
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:51,759
Hell, man.
My mom's got the room
all cleaned out.

588
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:56,493
She's all excited.
She thinks you know all
the movie stars in California.

589
00:33:58,001 --> 00:34:00,162
Wait a minute.
Let's just, uh--

590
00:34:00,237 --> 00:34:02,432
Let's just hang here
a minute, okay?

591
00:34:03,407 --> 00:34:04,965
I mean, damn.

592
00:34:05,042 --> 00:34:07,840
I didn't think I was ever
gonna see you again,
you know.

593
00:34:07,911 --> 00:34:10,436
Upstairs we can't really talk.

594
00:34:12,249 --> 00:34:14,183
You want some?

595
00:34:14,251 --> 00:34:16,151
<i>Uh, no, no.</i>
<i>That's cool.</i>

596
00:34:16,687 --> 00:34:17,949
I just take a little.

597
00:34:18,021 --> 00:34:19,249
Yeah, sure.

598
00:34:20,357 --> 00:34:22,791
We just--
We should go to Monty's
right now.

599
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,555
<i>Nah, it's late.</i>
<i>It's late.</i>

600
00:34:25,562 --> 00:34:27,530
What time is it?

601
00:34:28,465 --> 00:34:30,490
We'll go in the morning, then.

602
00:34:33,504 --> 00:34:36,200
I hate to--
I hate seeing him
like he is, man.

603
00:34:36,273 --> 00:34:37,706
He's fucked up.

604
00:34:40,144 --> 00:34:41,805
And your mom,
she--

605
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:44,579
She didn't think
you'd come back.

606
00:34:45,682 --> 00:34:47,377
She told me that, uh--

607
00:34:49,153 --> 00:34:51,348
She tells everybody
about your book.

608
00:34:52,723 --> 00:34:56,659
It's like your friend, remember?
That, that kid, fuckin' Irish.

609
00:35:03,133 --> 00:35:05,033
How are you?

610
00:35:05,102 --> 00:35:06,228
How am I?

611
00:35:06,303 --> 00:35:07,895
Are you alright?

612
00:35:07,971 --> 00:35:10,439
I'm alright.
Ah!

613
00:35:10,507 --> 00:35:13,476
I don't know
how to answer that, man.

614
00:35:13,544 --> 00:35:16,411
Just like my fuckin' mom.
Like I told you.

615
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,917
I told you how she's so excited
to see you, and then with me,
you know, it's like--

616
00:35:22,886 --> 00:35:23,944
When I--

617
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:28,087
She sees me
on the street,
she hides.

618
00:35:29,193 --> 00:35:35,291
And she's so fat, you know.
And she tries to hide behind
these skinny little poles.

619
00:35:35,365 --> 00:35:37,993
Poles like that
right there.

620
00:35:40,671 --> 00:35:43,902
Even she hides from me
and she's my fuckin' mom.

621
00:35:44,975 --> 00:35:46,602
They're not supposed
to do that.

622
00:35:46,677 --> 00:35:49,703
I know.
Things will--

623
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:52,078
Things will pick up
and get better.

624
00:35:53,016 --> 00:35:54,608
No, man.

625
00:35:55,752 --> 00:35:59,279
Things don't get better here.
You tell me
that they fuckin' do, but--

626
00:36:07,798 --> 00:36:10,858
It's really,
it's fuckin' good
to see you, man.

627
00:36:10,934 --> 00:36:12,458
That's the truth.

628
00:36:14,438 --> 00:36:16,838
Is that true?

629
00:36:22,045 --> 00:36:23,706
<i>Shit!</i>

630
00:36:29,553 --> 00:36:31,418
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

631
00:36:36,026 --> 00:36:39,689
<i>They got this thing</i>
<i>over the Empire State Building</i>

632
00:36:39,763 --> 00:36:41,822
<i>which is like Ripley's</i>
<i>Believe it or Not.</i>

633
00:36:41,899 --> 00:36:44,834
Mike was telling me
about this guy he saw.
He's humongous.

634
00:36:44,902 --> 00:36:49,305
<i>It's a 10-foot tall statue</i>
<i>of this real guy</i>
<i>and a bunch of other shit.</i>

635
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:51,568
That's where the niggers
stay at, right?

636
00:36:51,642 --> 00:36:53,872
<i>No.</i>
<i>That's 42nd Street.</i>

637
00:36:53,944 --> 00:36:57,675
<i>Oh, Yeah.</i>
<i>Needledick was saying they got</i>
<i>triple X movie over there.</i>

638
00:36:57,748 --> 00:37:00,273
<i>Like fuckin' people</i>
<i>fuckin' pigs and shit.</i>

639
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:03,342
<i>People fuckin' pigs?</i>
<i>Get the fuck out of here!</i>

640
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:06,218
<i>This guy is like 10 feet tall.</i>
<i>He's fuckin' huge, man.</i>

641
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:08,121
There's loads
of cool shit there.

642
00:37:08,191 --> 00:37:09,988
<i>Check this guy out.</i>

643
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:12,790
What do you wanna see,
some fuckin' titties
or a giant?

644
00:37:12,863 --> 00:37:14,831
Yeah, I wanna see a pig
get fucked.

645
00:37:14,898 --> 00:37:16,297
<i>Exactly.</i>

646
00:37:18,368 --> 00:37:23,635
<i>Mike, huh?</i>
<i>Dito says that you guys work</i>
<i>for some faggot, right?</i>

647
00:37:23,707 --> 00:37:25,572
<i>Think he can give me</i>
<i>a job?</i>

648
00:37:26,443 --> 00:37:28,138
I'll see.

649
00:37:28,211 --> 00:37:29,200
<i>Yeah?</i>

650
00:37:29,279 --> 00:37:30,644
<i>Yeah, man.</i>
<i>I'll check out.</i>

651
00:37:30,714 --> 00:37:32,807
<i>Yo, this weed is bogus.</i>

652
00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:37,479
<i>I know a guy from school.</i>
<i>He's got great weed.</i>
<i>That shit will fuck you up.</i>

653
00:37:37,554 --> 00:37:40,022
He's cool as well.
Guy is cool.

654
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:41,421
<i>Wow!</i>

655
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:45,890
You can get weed, huh?
This guy's pretty fuckin' cool.

656
00:37:46,496 --> 00:37:49,488
<i>He can get fuckin' pot.</i>

657
00:37:49,566 --> 00:37:52,364
<i>That's pretty fuckin'--yeah.</i>
<i>This guy's pretty cool.</i>

658
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:54,063
<i>You can understand</i>
<i>what he says?</i>

659
00:37:54,137 --> 00:37:56,867
<i>'Cause I can't fuckin'</i>
<i>understand him.</i>

660
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:59,272
Yo, Dito,
I'm going to take off, man.

661
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:03,241
Where you going?
Where you going?

662
00:38:03,981 --> 00:38:06,108
What's your problem, man?

663
00:38:06,917 --> 00:38:08,714
<i>Antonio, I don't want</i>
<i>any trouble.</i>

664
00:38:08,785 --> 00:38:12,084
I just wanna hang out.
If you got a problem
with me, I'll go.

665
00:38:12,155 --> 00:38:13,986
<i>No, man.</i>
<i>I ain't got no problem.</i>

666
00:38:14,057 --> 00:38:15,854
You can hang out
as much as you want.

667
00:38:15,926 --> 00:38:18,451
You can show us
where the giants are
and all that.

668
00:38:18,528 --> 00:38:21,793
I like this guy.
He's, he's fun.
He's a good guy.

669
00:38:21,865 --> 00:38:24,265
<i>We're getting something</i>
<i>to eat,</i>

670
00:38:24,334 --> 00:38:27,235
<i>and she wants to go</i>
<i>go White Castle.</i>

671
00:38:27,304 --> 00:38:28,828
<i>Why don't you shut up?</i>

672
00:38:28,905 --> 00:38:30,395
<i>Why you got to do this?</i>

673
00:38:31,675 --> 00:38:32,505
What'd you say?

674
00:38:32,576 --> 00:38:34,043
<i>Why you got to do</i>
<i>that shit?</i>

675
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:36,011
Don't you fuckin' move, Diane.

676
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:39,039
Cut the fuckin' shit, alright?

677
00:38:39,116 --> 00:38:40,413
Do what?

678
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:44,011
<i>You know what.</i>
<i>It's just played out.</i>

679
00:38:44,087 --> 00:38:46,282
<i>What's played out?</i>

680
00:38:50,694 --> 00:38:51,820
She moved.

681
00:38:51,895 --> 00:38:55,592
What the fuck.
I'm fucking serious.
That shit is not funny!

682
00:38:55,665 --> 00:38:57,394
<i>Giuseppe, that's enough.</i>

683
00:38:57,467 --> 00:38:59,264
I'm getting the fuck
out of here.

684
00:38:59,336 --> 00:39:01,600
<i>Yeah?</i>
<i>Go ahead.</i>
<i>Bye.</i>

685
00:39:01,671 --> 00:39:04,640
<i>Could you do something</i>
<i>about your fucking</i>
<i>crazy brother?</i>

686
00:39:04,708 --> 00:39:06,300
Fuck you, Giuseppe, alright?

687
00:39:06,977 --> 00:39:10,208
<i>You fuckin' piece of shit!</i>
<i>Fuck you.</i>

688
00:39:11,915 --> 00:39:14,110
<i>Laurie!</i>

689
00:39:14,184 --> 00:39:16,448
She wants to go
to White Castle, alright?

690
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:21,389
This bitch loves going
to White Castle.
To White Castle.

691
00:39:21,458 --> 00:39:23,323
<i>Laurie?</i>
<i>Come on.</i>

692
00:39:23,393 --> 00:39:25,861
<i>Where you going?</i>

693
00:39:25,929 --> 00:39:28,363
Fuck them.
It's played out here.

694
00:39:29,633 --> 00:39:33,933
<i>Laurie.</i>
<i>Laurie, can you stop for a sec?</i>
<i>Laurie, come on!</i>

695
00:39:34,004 --> 00:39:36,632
Did you really see
what that fucker did?

696
00:39:36,706 --> 00:39:37,798
<i>I know.</i>

697
00:39:37,874 --> 00:39:39,842
You think that's funny?

698
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:42,845
I know it's not funny.
I don't think it's funny.

699
00:39:42,913 --> 00:39:44,175
Hold on a second!

700
00:39:44,247 --> 00:39:46,613
<i>I'm sorry.</i>
<i>I don't fuckin'</i>
<i>like that, either.</i>

701
00:39:46,683 --> 00:39:49,311
Yeah, right.
You do.

702
00:39:49,386 --> 00:39:51,877
I'm coming.
I'll be right there, alright?

703
00:39:52,956 --> 00:39:55,151
<i>I am sorry.</i>

704
00:39:56,093 --> 00:39:57,287
<i>Whatever.</i>

705
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:53,615
Hey, my name is Diane.
I like to fuck.

706
00:40:56,019 --> 00:40:57,611
My name is Jenny.

707
00:40:57,687 --> 00:41:00,588
And everybody in this place
is a fuckin' joke.

708
00:41:01,291 --> 00:41:03,418
My name is Nerf.

709
00:41:03,493 --> 00:41:04,926
And this shit sucks.

710
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:09,155
I'm Giuseppe,
Antonio's brother.

711
00:41:10,567 --> 00:41:12,728
I'm Laurie.

712
00:41:12,802 --> 00:41:14,531
And everybody's
gonna leave me.

713
00:41:16,106 --> 00:41:17,539
I know they are.

714
00:41:21,912 --> 00:41:24,039
I'm a fuckin' piece of shit.

715
00:41:25,282 --> 00:41:27,079
And that's who I am.

716
00:42:12,963 --> 00:42:16,126
<i>Hey, listen, Antonio.</i>
<i>I'm sorry about this</i>
<i>played out shit.</i>

717
00:42:16,199 --> 00:42:17,325
Don't worry about it.

718
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,561
No, that's fucked up!

719
00:42:25,508 --> 00:42:27,100
Now, that's fucked up.

720
00:42:31,281 --> 00:42:32,976
I'm going to go in.

721
00:42:34,517 --> 00:42:35,711
Do you want me to come?

722
00:42:35,785 --> 00:42:36,683
No.

723
00:42:37,988 --> 00:42:39,046
Don't worry.

724
00:42:39,122 --> 00:42:41,113
I'm good.
I'll call you tomorrow.

725
00:42:42,325 --> 00:42:48,025
<i>Monty said he wanted to play</i>
<i>some handball tomorrow.</i>
<i>So I'm gonna come by.</i>

726
00:42:48,098 --> 00:42:49,565
That's fucked up.

727
00:42:54,771 --> 00:42:57,740
<i>He's my Goddamned son, too.</i>

728
00:42:57,807 --> 00:43:00,503
<i>They run around</i>
<i>like a pack of wolves!</i>

729
00:43:00,577 --> 00:43:04,138
<i>Do you even have</i>
<i>any concern?</i>
<i>Do you?</i>

730
00:43:04,214 --> 00:43:06,307
<i>No!</i>

731
00:43:09,886 --> 00:43:12,650
What's wrong?
You okay, mom?

732
00:43:12,722 --> 00:43:14,314
I'm okay.

733
00:43:14,391 --> 00:43:16,552
It's okay.
It's nothing.

734
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:38,813
Dito.

735
00:43:41,451 --> 00:43:44,818
She, you know,
she got excited, you know.

736
00:43:47,057 --> 00:43:50,823
I was just, uh--
Your mother, she-- you know,
went for a walk.

737
00:43:50,894 --> 00:43:52,691
She gets excited.

738
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:54,889
You okay?

739
00:43:54,964 --> 00:43:57,194
Fine.

740
00:43:58,034 --> 00:43:59,194
<i>I'm good.</i>

741
00:44:00,737 --> 00:44:03,171
What happened with you
and Antonio?
He was here.

742
00:44:03,239 --> 00:44:06,606
He said you were mad at him.
You had a fight or something?

743
00:44:09,479 --> 00:44:10,946
It's alright.

744
00:44:14,284 --> 00:44:16,479
<i>How'd get that?</i>
<i>What's this on your face?</i>

745
00:44:18,188 --> 00:44:19,416
You okay?

746
00:44:19,489 --> 00:44:20,854
<i>Yeah.</i>

747
00:44:31,401 --> 00:44:33,528
<i>What happened to you?</i>
<i>What is this?</i>

748
00:44:33,603 --> 00:44:35,070
It's nothing.

749
00:44:36,306 --> 00:44:38,399
Hey, come on.
You know me.

750
00:44:39,242 --> 00:44:41,142
Rock of Gibraltar, right?

751
00:44:41,211 --> 00:44:42,371
Yeah.

752
00:44:43,813 --> 00:44:45,075
Yeah.

753
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:48,508
<i>You been taking</i>
<i>your Dilantin?</i>

754
00:44:48,585 --> 00:44:50,348
<i>What, are you writing</i>
<i>a book, huh?</i>

755
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:51,717
No, it's just--

756
00:44:52,622 --> 00:44:54,146
<i>I'm fine, okay?</i>

757
00:44:54,224 --> 00:44:55,782
You were on one
of your journeys

758
00:44:55,859 --> 00:45:00,091
with that kid Mike
in Manhattan.
Antonio was telling me.

759
00:45:00,163 --> 00:45:01,960
<i>I wasn't with Mike.</i>

760
00:45:04,768 --> 00:45:08,101
What if I did go?
What if I went to Manhattan
or I went somewhere else

761
00:45:08,171 --> 00:45:10,332
like, uh, I don't know?

762
00:45:15,311 --> 00:45:18,075
Come on.
You're not
going anywhere, Dito.

763
00:45:20,850 --> 00:45:21,942
Come here.

764
00:45:23,787 --> 00:45:25,584
<i>How are you, Dito, huh?</i>

765
00:45:26,589 --> 00:45:28,682
<i>Since when are you here</i>
<i>at this time?</i>

766
00:45:29,959 --> 00:45:32,450
Put on the TV.
Give your old man
a break, huh?

767
00:46:02,525 --> 00:46:03,924
Forget it.

768
00:46:05,328 --> 00:46:06,989
Are you scared?

769
00:46:08,465 --> 00:46:10,126
<i>I would be.</i>

770
00:46:10,767 --> 00:46:14,863
If a guy wrote on my house
"I was dead",
he's already fucked you up.

771
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:17,236
I'd be having
a fuckin' heart attack.

772
00:46:20,877 --> 00:46:22,344
They just write shit.

773
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:26,242
Locker room
disinfectant stuff, right?

774
00:46:26,316 --> 00:46:28,477
<i>Check this shit out.</i>

775
00:46:28,551 --> 00:46:32,317
"Do not inhale, breathe.
Avoid skin-eye contact.

776
00:46:32,388 --> 00:46:35,084
Irritant.
Skin irritant.
Unsafe.

777
00:46:35,158 --> 00:46:38,252
Eye irritant.
Skin irritant.
Unsafe.

778
00:46:38,328 --> 00:46:40,762
Keep away
from all body parts."

779
00:46:42,832 --> 00:46:43,992
Wanna try it?

780
00:46:44,868 --> 00:46:46,028
What, do you drink it?

781
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:48,396
Sniff it.

782
00:46:56,012 --> 00:46:59,345
<i>Mike, I'm sorry</i>
<i>Antonio's a fuckin'</i>
<i>asshole, man.</i>

783
00:46:59,415 --> 00:47:03,010
<i>He's not always like that.</i>
<i>It's just when he gets</i>
<i>around people and shit.</i>

784
00:47:03,086 --> 00:47:04,678
Fuck him.

785
00:47:04,754 --> 00:47:08,690
You're always
fuckin' afraid of him.
Give me that shit, man.

786
00:47:09,726 --> 00:47:11,421
<i>No, I'm not afraid.</i>

787
00:47:11,494 --> 00:47:13,325
He's a dick.

788
00:47:19,736 --> 00:47:21,033
Fuck him.

789
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:28,037
I'm scared, Mike.
It's just--

790
00:47:28,111 --> 00:47:31,410
I'm sorry.
I don't even fuckin' know
what I'm saying when smoking.

791
00:47:32,749 --> 00:47:35,217
What the fuck
are you sorry for, Mike?

792
00:47:35,285 --> 00:47:38,914
If some guys were after me
like that, I would be
shitting myself.

793
00:47:42,458 --> 00:47:44,824
California's probably
the best, right?

794
00:47:46,629 --> 00:47:48,654
I always think
about that place.

795
00:47:48,731 --> 00:47:50,164
Well, let's go, then.

796
00:47:50,233 --> 00:47:51,222
What do you mean?

797
00:47:51,301 --> 00:47:52,996
Let's just fucking go.

798
00:47:53,636 --> 00:47:57,003
I saw this, uh,
TV commercial, right?

799
00:47:57,073 --> 00:48:00,372
You can take like a,
a bus, right?

800
00:48:00,443 --> 00:48:02,308
It's $39.

801
00:48:03,947 --> 00:48:05,505
$39?

802
00:48:06,916 --> 00:48:08,577
That's crazy.

803
00:48:11,254 --> 00:48:16,021
Hey, is your fuckin' head
going like boom, boom, boom?
Like hard.

804
00:48:47,490 --> 00:48:48,855
Laurie.

805
00:48:51,327 --> 00:48:52,589
Laurie?

806
00:48:53,863 --> 00:48:55,387
You're so stupid.

807
00:48:55,465 --> 00:48:56,454
<i>Uh?</i>

808
00:48:56,532 --> 00:48:58,693
Hey, stupid,
I'm not talking to you.

809
00:48:58,768 --> 00:49:00,326
I'm still not gonna
talk to you.

810
00:49:00,403 --> 00:49:02,098
<i>Come on.</i>

811
00:49:02,839 --> 00:49:05,205
<i>I'm not talking.</i>
<i>Why are you here?</i>

812
00:49:05,274 --> 00:49:06,673
Why are you even here?

813
00:49:06,743 --> 00:49:08,176
'Cause I wanna be here.

814
00:49:08,244 --> 00:49:09,905
Yeah?

815
00:49:09,979 --> 00:49:11,776
Yeah.

816
00:49:15,918 --> 00:49:18,079
What's wrong?
Why are you still mad?

817
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:22,785
You forgot, right?
You let Giuseppe throw knives
at me and Diane.

818
00:49:22,859 --> 00:49:24,622
You still mad
about that?

819
00:49:24,694 --> 00:49:32,157
Like, I'm not even mad.
I just feel like the whole shit
was stupid, you know?

820
00:49:34,203 --> 00:49:36,671
Hello?
Shit.

821
00:49:38,341 --> 00:49:39,831
You're drunk.

822
00:49:39,909 --> 00:49:41,638
No.

823
00:49:41,711 --> 00:49:42,803
Oh, shit.

824
00:49:43,579 --> 00:49:45,979
You're stoned.
Yeah, you are.

825
00:49:46,049 --> 00:49:47,073
<i>No, I'm not.</i>

826
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:48,617
You are.

827
00:49:49,252 --> 00:49:51,311
You know what I'm gonna do
if you let me in?

828
00:49:51,421 --> 00:49:54,254
No.
What you gonna do?

829
00:49:56,059 --> 00:49:57,856
I'm not even
gonna fuck you.

830
00:49:57,927 --> 00:50:00,794
Wow! You're not
gonna even fuck me!

831
00:50:01,464 --> 00:50:02,692
Not even if I let you in?

832
00:50:05,568 --> 00:50:07,195
I'm just gonna lick
your pussy.

833
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:08,760
Oh, my God.

834
00:50:08,838 --> 00:50:11,671
My mother's like right there.
She can hear you right now.

835
00:50:11,741 --> 00:50:12,935
You know why?

836
00:50:15,011 --> 00:50:16,569
No, why?

837
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:18,542
Why what?

838
00:50:21,350 --> 00:50:22,783
What are you talking about?

839
00:50:22,852 --> 00:50:25,753
I don't know--
I don't know why
you're gonna lick my pussy.

840
00:50:25,822 --> 00:50:28,017
That's what you wanted me
to say.

841
00:50:28,091 --> 00:50:29,217
Because, uhm,

842
00:50:29,292 --> 00:50:33,558
I'm gonna lick your pussy
because me and Mike
we're going to California

843
00:50:33,629 --> 00:50:34,994
with our band and shit.

844
00:50:35,064 --> 00:50:37,897
I want you to come, you know,
because I love you.

845
00:50:37,967 --> 00:50:40,367
Because the fuckin' Mets won.

846
00:50:40,436 --> 00:50:42,996
What?
What did you say?

847
00:50:44,273 --> 00:50:45,900
You said you love me.

848
00:50:45,975 --> 00:50:46,999
What?

849
00:50:47,076 --> 00:50:49,067
You said you love me, right?

850
00:50:51,781 --> 00:50:54,477
I'm serious.
That shit means
a lot to me, you know.

851
00:50:57,453 --> 00:50:59,717
I love you.
I don't why.
I love you.

852
00:50:59,789 --> 00:51:01,723
'Cause I love you.
'Cause--

853
00:51:02,859 --> 00:51:04,451
I can't.

854
00:51:05,628 --> 00:51:07,528
Stupid.

855
00:51:16,305 --> 00:51:18,535
<i>Hey, yo.</i>
<i>Hey, yo,</i>

856
00:51:18,608 --> 00:51:20,872
I stole us a Spalding
from Fishbein's.

857
00:51:20,943 --> 00:51:23,912
I swear that fuckin' Charlie
his getting blind as he can be.

858
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:26,278
I can't wait to get
that motherfucker.

859
00:51:26,349 --> 00:51:28,874
I would play.
I just gotta go back.

860
00:51:28,951 --> 00:51:30,509
I gotta go
to the city right now.

861
00:51:30,586 --> 00:51:33,953
What do you wanna go
to Manhattan for?
Monty wanted to play handball.

862
00:51:34,023 --> 00:51:35,285
You okay?
What happened?

863
00:51:35,358 --> 00:51:38,225
It was my fuckin' father.
You wanna go first
to the park?

864
00:51:38,294 --> 00:51:40,728
No, I gotta fu--
I gotta go fuckin'
with the dogs.

865
00:51:40,797 --> 00:51:42,526
Mike with the dogs?
Come on.
Hey!

866
00:51:42,598 --> 00:51:45,328
Maybe you could see
if I can get a job there, man.

867
00:51:45,401 --> 00:51:47,995
Tell your friend
I ain't gonna fuck
with him, right?

868
00:51:48,070 --> 00:51:50,698
Maybe we can hang out later.

869
00:51:55,578 --> 00:51:56,977
Look who's here.

870
00:51:57,046 --> 00:51:58,946
<i>Sorry.</i>
<i>I got lost</i>
<i>changing trains.</i>

871
00:51:59,015 --> 00:52:03,247
Take little Geronimo here.
You got to go
through the teeth over here.

872
00:52:04,754 --> 00:52:08,383
Look at Young Geronimo.
Careful, motherfucker.
The teeth are lethal.

873
00:52:08,457 --> 00:52:13,087
Take Bobo and Lulu too,
because Miss Levitt will have
a fuckin' heart attack.

874
00:52:13,162 --> 00:52:16,290
You gotta go through here.
Merry-go-round.

875
00:52:16,365 --> 00:52:19,198
Could they make it
a little more heat
in this city or what?

876
00:52:19,268 --> 00:52:21,293
Sorry, he's blind.
Poor kid.

877
00:52:21,370 --> 00:52:23,964
So this guy
has a Pomeranian.
Marilyn.

878
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:27,407
You gotta walk the thing
sometimes for like an hour
before it craps.

879
00:52:27,476 --> 00:52:31,310
On 2nd Avenue.
Bobby, the owner, he can be
a real pain in the ass.

880
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:35,976
He'll check the dog's ass.
Make sure it just does it.
Okay?

881
00:52:36,052 --> 00:52:37,679
Thank you, ma'am.
They're okay.

882
00:52:37,753 --> 00:52:40,085
Those things always end up
with you going to hell.

883
00:52:40,156 --> 00:52:42,784
So, remember he's like
an entertainment manager,

884
00:52:42,859 --> 00:52:45,555
or like he owns a store
or something.
Fish and lizards.

885
00:52:45,628 --> 00:52:47,357
But music, too.
Whatever.

886
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:49,364
I told him about you guys
and the music,

887
00:52:49,432 --> 00:52:52,765
and that maybe
he should do something.
You never know, okay?

888
00:52:52,835 --> 00:52:56,771
I gotta head downtown.
Mikey, you have the address.
You can walk from here.

889
00:52:56,839 --> 00:52:59,967
And break the leg.
That's what they say
in the big time.

890
00:53:00,042 --> 00:53:01,839
Cheerio, Frank.

891
00:53:09,685 --> 00:53:12,677
Your mothers must be
really proud of you.

892
00:53:21,197 --> 00:53:23,961
I could jump from one side
to the other like this.

893
00:53:24,033 --> 00:53:26,797
Jesse Owens would've.
You're not a track star, man.

894
00:53:26,869 --> 00:53:29,633
I'm sorry.
I hate to tell you this.
You're not making it.

895
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:35,907
What you think,
you cute Giuseppe?

896
00:53:35,978 --> 00:53:38,310
I'm not cute.
I'm handsome.

897
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:39,712
<i>Who the fuck</i>
<i>told you that?</i>

898
00:53:39,782 --> 00:53:41,545
Girls.

899
00:53:41,617 --> 00:53:43,812
Go get my ball, man.

900
00:53:43,886 --> 00:53:46,616
<i>Go get my--</i>
<i>Go get my ball.</i>

901
00:53:48,257 --> 00:53:50,725
Hey, Bobby.

902
00:53:50,793 --> 00:53:53,023
This is Dito.

903
00:53:53,095 --> 00:53:55,188
Hey, there.
I'll bring him right back.

904
00:53:55,264 --> 00:53:56,595
Thanks.

905
00:53:56,666 --> 00:53:57,826
Let's go.

906
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:01,028
No, don't fuck with that.
Come on, man.

907
00:54:01,103 --> 00:54:04,197
Touch it
with your finger.
With your finger.

908
00:54:04,273 --> 00:54:05,900
What the fuck
are you doing, man?

909
00:54:05,975 --> 00:54:10,207
I heard if you put both feet
on it at the same time,
nothing happens.

910
00:54:10,279 --> 00:54:12,873
You like conduct
electricity and shit.

911
00:54:12,949 --> 00:54:15,577
What are you Einstein?
You sound like an idiot.

912
00:54:19,021 --> 00:54:21,387
<i>You're worried about me,</i>
<i>Antonio, aren't you?</i>

913
00:54:21,457 --> 00:54:23,652
Am I fuckin' worried
about you?

914
00:54:23,726 --> 00:54:28,186
<i>The fuckin' train is coming.</i>
<i>I don't give a fuck about you.</i>
<i>Get my ball, man.</i>

915
00:54:28,264 --> 00:54:29,891
You don't give a shit?

916
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:34,369
Now how about
giving a shit?

917
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:37,406
The fuckin' train is coming.
You don't see it?

918
00:54:37,473 --> 00:54:39,168
Tell me you're worried
about me.

919
00:54:39,241 --> 00:54:42,768
<i>I don't give a fuck about you.</i>
<i>If you wanna die, go ahead.</i>
<i>Go ahead.</i>

920
00:54:42,845 --> 00:54:45,109
You're not gonna tell me
you're worried about me?

921
00:54:45,181 --> 00:54:47,945
What the fuck?
Come on, man.
Get the fuck up here.

922
00:54:48,017 --> 00:54:51,282
What the fuck are you doing?
The train's coming
right at you.

923
00:54:51,354 --> 00:54:53,322
You're my brother.

924
00:54:53,389 --> 00:54:55,448
The fuckin' train.
It's right there.

925
00:54:55,524 --> 00:54:58,755
<i>You're gonna be retarded</i>
<i>and just sit down?</i>
<i>I don't give a fuck.</i>

926
00:54:58,828 --> 00:55:02,594
Get the fuck out already.
Get the fuck out!

927
00:55:02,665 --> 00:55:05,225
<i>Go!</i>
<i>Get the fuck out!</i>

928
00:55:32,428 --> 00:55:34,225
I was calling.
You okay?

929
00:55:34,296 --> 00:55:35,320
Yeah, I'm fine.

930
00:55:35,398 --> 00:55:39,562
When I call you,
you always call me back.
I got worried.

931
00:55:40,603 --> 00:55:41,831
This is messed up, huh?

932
00:55:41,904 --> 00:55:45,067
It's fucked up.
It's just fucked up.

933
00:55:47,443 --> 00:55:51,345
I'm getting out of here.
Me and Mike we're leaving.
We're going to California.

934
00:55:51,414 --> 00:55:55,145
I know.
Remember you told me?
You wanted me to go with you.

935
00:55:55,217 --> 00:55:56,548
Yeah.

936
00:55:56,619 --> 00:55:59,645
What?
You don't want me
to go with you?

937
00:55:59,722 --> 00:56:01,690
Is that what you're saying?

938
00:56:01,757 --> 00:56:03,987
I want to talk
to Antonio.

939
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:05,584
I'm just going to talk.

940
00:56:05,661 --> 00:56:08,892
Why can't you even look
at me right now?
You're not looking at me.

941
00:56:08,964 --> 00:56:11,023
How do you mean?
How else can I look at you?

942
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:14,194
You said that
you loved me, right?
Did you mean that?

943
00:56:14,270 --> 00:56:17,706
<i>Laurie, I'm sorry.</i>
<i>I'm sorry.</i>
<i>I'm gonna talk to Antonio.</i>

944
00:56:17,773 --> 00:56:20,435
You better not.
You better talk to me right now.

945
00:56:27,483 --> 00:56:30,179
You okay?
You okay?

946
00:56:30,252 --> 00:56:33,983
Don't worry about it.
What are you going to do?
It's fucked up.

947
00:56:34,056 --> 00:56:36,752
He's, he's fucking--
He's stupid.

948
00:56:36,826 --> 00:56:39,488
It's just fuckin'--
Now he's dead
and he's stupid.

949
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:42,759
You know Giuseppe.
He's fuckin',
he's an idiot.

950
00:56:42,832 --> 00:56:45,892
I found out
where the fuckin'
Reaper guy is.

951
00:56:45,968 --> 00:56:49,870
I found him for sure this time.
I know where they hang out.

952
00:56:49,939 --> 00:56:52,669
Don't worry about that, either.
I'm gonna kill his ass.

953
00:56:52,741 --> 00:56:56,040
I'm here for Giuseppe.
Antonio, you're here
for your brother.

954
00:56:56,112 --> 00:56:57,807
That's your brother
in a box.

955
00:56:57,880 --> 00:56:59,177
That's your brother.

956
00:56:59,248 --> 00:57:02,911
Is that all you think about,
the Reaper guy?
It's your brother's funeral.

957
00:57:02,985 --> 00:57:06,250
What the fuck do you mean,
"Is that all I ever
fuckin' think about?

958
00:57:06,322 --> 00:57:08,290
What do you mean?

959
00:57:09,992 --> 00:57:11,687
What do you mean by that?

960
00:57:12,495 --> 00:57:13,621
What'd I say?

961
00:57:13,696 --> 00:57:17,996
All I ever think about is you?
Is that what you're saying?
I think about you?

962
00:57:18,901 --> 00:57:21,893
I'm asking you
a fuckin' question.
What did you mean by that?

963
00:57:21,971 --> 00:57:24,098
I didn't mean
anything by it.

964
00:57:24,173 --> 00:57:27,108
Get the fuck out!
I don't even fuckin' care
about you!

965
00:57:27,176 --> 00:57:30,168
I don't fuckin' even care.
Do you hear me?
I don't give a fuck.

966
00:57:30,246 --> 00:57:31,804
<i>Antonio!</i>

967
00:57:31,881 --> 00:57:33,473
I'm sorry, Monty.

968
00:57:35,017 --> 00:57:36,985
Fuck!
Fuck!

969
00:57:45,661 --> 00:57:46,992
You alright?

970
00:58:10,619 --> 00:58:12,143
Hey.

971
00:58:12,221 --> 00:58:16,419
Do you know this used to be
a candy store here?
Can you believe it?

972
00:58:37,646 --> 00:58:40,706
What does the Stop mean?
Do you see the hand?

973
00:58:40,783 --> 00:58:42,114
Stop!

974
00:58:42,184 --> 00:58:44,914
It means you don't cross
the street.
You stop.

975
00:58:46,255 --> 00:58:47,517
Go.

976
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:51,185
Yo! Don't be making
no transactions
on my corner here, alright?

977
00:58:53,295 --> 00:58:54,762
<i>Yo.</i>

978
00:58:56,298 --> 00:59:00,064
Fuckin' Hector.
Little kids here, man.

979
00:59:00,135 --> 00:59:03,263
I'm serious.
I'm serious, Hector.

980
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:07,136
Fuckin' television.
Yo, that works?

981
00:59:07,209 --> 00:59:10,201
<i>Hey, is that's flat screen?</i>

982
00:59:10,279 --> 00:59:13,271
<i>Yo, I'm serious.</i>
<i>That works?</i>

983
00:59:20,489 --> 00:59:22,354
<i>You used to be a swimmer?</i>

984
00:59:22,424 --> 00:59:25,086
Oh, you used to be
a swimmer, right?

985
00:59:28,297 --> 00:59:31,730
Hey.

986
00:59:32,801 --> 00:59:33,859
Who's that?

987
00:59:33,936 --> 00:59:36,905
Shit.
This is Joey.
Look.

988
00:59:36,972 --> 00:59:38,803
Joseph.
Mr. Joey.

989
00:59:40,576 --> 00:59:42,203
Joey, like Giuseppe?

990
00:59:45,247 --> 00:59:47,078
Like Joseph.

991
00:59:47,149 --> 00:59:48,844
It's his father's name.
Joseph.

992
00:59:48,917 --> 00:59:50,248
<i>Mommy, who's that man?</i>

993
00:59:50,319 --> 00:59:53,379
<i>He's gone now.</i>
<i>He wants to know</i>
<i>who you are.</i>

994
00:59:53,455 --> 00:59:56,447
<i>I've known your mother</i>
<i>since she was, like,</i>
<i>she was this big.</i>

995
00:59:56,525 --> 00:59:58,891
<i>She can't be this big,</i>
<i>you know.</i>

996
01:00:01,263 --> 01:00:03,595
Your mom said
you were coming into town.

997
01:00:03,666 --> 01:00:05,531
Yeah, I'm gonna see
my father.

998
01:00:06,502 --> 01:00:09,437
<i>Yeah, Nerf told me,</i>
<i>you know, you'd be here</i>
<i>in your corner.</i>

999
01:00:09,505 --> 01:00:11,473
<i>My corner.</i>
<i>Nerf.</i>

1000
01:00:13,976 --> 01:00:15,068
Wow.

1001
01:00:16,011 --> 01:00:17,638
Wow.

1002
01:00:17,713 --> 01:00:20,580
Laurie, you look beautiful.

1003
01:00:20,649 --> 01:00:22,480
<i>You know, I'm in my bests.</i>

1004
01:00:22,551 --> 01:00:25,179
I'm looking really good.
My best slippers.

1005
01:00:25,254 --> 01:00:27,552
You should see them actually.
Manolo's.

1006
01:00:30,125 --> 01:00:32,457
<i>You're staying</i>
<i>at your mother's, right?</i>

1007
01:00:32,528 --> 01:00:33,790
Nerf's.

1008
01:00:33,862 --> 01:00:36,228
Nerf's mother's.
Alright.

1009
01:00:36,298 --> 01:00:38,892
Yeah.
Alright.

1010
01:00:38,967 --> 01:00:43,267
I'll be around, you know.
Maybe later I'll come back
or you wanna come down.

1011
01:00:43,339 --> 01:00:44,806
You wanna come down
and play.

1012
01:00:46,709 --> 01:00:50,076
It was really nice to see you.
I gotta make dinner now.

1013
01:00:50,779 --> 01:00:52,337
<i>It's good to see you.</i>

1014
01:00:53,549 --> 01:00:55,813
Alright.
See you, Mr. Joey.

1015
01:01:27,716 --> 01:01:30,549
Antonio.
Yo!

1016
01:01:31,286 --> 01:01:32,651
Antonio.

1017
01:01:33,789 --> 01:01:35,347
Yo, Antonio.

1018
01:01:35,424 --> 01:01:37,016
<i>Yo, Dito,</i>
<i>what's up, man?</i>

1019
01:01:37,092 --> 01:01:38,923
Come on.
I'm sorry.

1020
01:01:38,994 --> 01:01:41,053
<i>What's up, Dito?</i>
<i>Where the fuck you been?</i>

1021
01:01:41,130 --> 01:01:44,725
I know where he's been,
since he's all I have
to think about.

1022
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:46,290
He's all I have
to think about.

1023
01:01:46,368 --> 01:01:47,460
I'm fuckin' working.

1024
01:01:47,536 --> 01:01:49,697
What are you always
fuckin' pissed off for?

1025
01:01:49,772 --> 01:01:53,139
I'm not pissed off.
You know your father
had a seizure?

1026
01:01:53,208 --> 01:01:56,575
This guy don't even know
his fuckin' father
had a seizure.

1027
01:01:56,645 --> 01:01:58,704
He's acting like
there's nothing wrong.

1028
01:01:58,781 --> 01:02:00,578
You're in fuckin' Niggerville.

1029
01:02:00,649 --> 01:02:03,140
Nerf's dad is black.
What happened to my father?

1030
01:02:03,218 --> 01:02:04,583
My father's Dominican.

1031
01:02:04,653 --> 01:02:06,985
Nerf's fuckin' Nerf, man.

1032
01:02:07,055 --> 01:02:09,785
<i>You're never around anymore.</i>
<i>Where the fuck were you?</i>

1033
01:02:09,858 --> 01:02:11,723
Where the fuck are you?
Nowhere!

1034
01:02:12,461 --> 01:02:14,258
This fuckin' guy.
Come on, let's go.

1035
01:02:14,329 --> 01:02:16,490
I don't fuckin' know you
anymore!

1036
01:02:16,565 --> 01:02:18,260
Yo, tell me who the fuck--

1037
01:02:18,333 --> 01:02:21,200
Look, yo,
you don't think
I'd fuck you up?

1038
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:22,328
Chill out, Antonio.

1039
01:02:22,404 --> 01:02:26,602
You have no idea
how fuckin' close you are.
Nerf, let's just fuckin' go.

1040
01:02:27,342 --> 01:02:28,434
<i>Antonio!</i>

1041
01:02:28,510 --> 01:02:31,172
Nerf.
Nerf!

1042
01:02:50,666 --> 01:02:53,499
What's up, motherfucker?
Think you can hide from me?

1043
01:02:53,569 --> 01:02:55,833
Think you can fuck
with my family?

1044
01:02:55,904 --> 01:02:58,134
Think you can fuck
with my family, nigger?

1045
01:03:04,112 --> 01:03:06,478
Don't fuck with me
'cause I know your family.

1046
01:03:06,548 --> 01:03:08,743
I know your father.
I know where you live.

1047
01:03:09,852 --> 01:03:12,878
Don't fuck with TSS!
Next time I'll kill you.
That's my word.

1048
01:03:12,955 --> 01:03:17,324
I know your family.
I know you live right here.
Don't ever fuck with me!

1049
01:03:18,594 --> 01:03:19,720
Hurry up.

1050
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:26,963
You're scared.

1051
01:03:30,639 --> 01:03:33,506
<i>Yo!</i>
<i>What the fuck, man?</i>

1052
01:03:34,443 --> 01:03:36,001
Yo!
Yo, yo, yo yo.

1053
01:03:36,078 --> 01:03:38,239
Just-- just fuckin' lay there
for a second.

1054
01:03:39,381 --> 01:03:41,611
Yo, come here.
Come here.
Look at me.

1055
01:03:41,683 --> 01:03:43,480
Oh, fuck.
He fucked up.

1056
01:03:43,552 --> 01:03:44,644
Don't be mad, okay?

1057
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,517
No, no.
Nerf, get your mother's car.

1058
01:03:46,588 --> 01:03:48,749
Go get your mother's car
right now.

1059
01:03:48,824 --> 01:03:52,351
You're fucked up.
That fuckin'.
It's--

1060
01:03:55,063 --> 01:03:57,293
<i>Oh, fuck!</i>

1061
01:04:07,709 --> 01:04:11,270
<i>Every day something's different</i>
<i>with you guys.</i>
<i>I don't know what it is.</i>

1062
01:04:11,346 --> 01:04:14,873
Every day is something, huh?
Right, Antonio?
Every day is something.

1063
01:04:14,950 --> 01:04:16,474
Yeah.

1064
01:04:18,987 --> 01:04:22,150
<i>So what happened this time?</i>
<i>A dog bite you?</i>
<i>Huh?</i>

1065
01:04:22,224 --> 01:04:23,953
I told you I fell off
a park fence.

1066
01:04:24,026 --> 01:04:26,187
Oh, you fell off a fence?

1067
01:04:28,163 --> 01:04:30,996
Never mind about that, okay?
Just tell me what happened.

1068
01:04:33,902 --> 01:04:35,130
Hi.

1069
01:04:35,203 --> 01:04:36,864
It's 2:00 in the morning.

1070
01:04:36,939 --> 01:04:39,271
<i>I just wanted to see</i>
<i>what happened.</i>

1071
01:04:41,476 --> 01:04:43,034
Sorry.

1072
01:04:43,111 --> 01:04:45,045
What happened?

1073
01:04:45,981 --> 01:04:48,472
There, now you see.
Now go.

1074
01:04:50,052 --> 01:04:52,816
I said I just want to know
what happened.

1075
01:04:52,888 --> 01:04:57,222
The freaking graffiti guys.
You know, the Reaper.
Your fuckin' race.

1076
01:04:57,292 --> 01:04:58,987
They whacked him
with a bat.

1077
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:00,858
<i>It's not my race.</i>

1078
01:05:00,929 --> 01:05:04,365
<i>Monty?</i>
<i>What are you doing out there?</i>

1079
01:05:04,433 --> 01:05:08,631
Uh, don't worry, Flori.
I'm talking to Dito
and Antonio, okay?

1080
01:05:08,704 --> 01:05:11,502
<i>It's so late!</i>

1081
01:05:12,808 --> 01:05:15,606
These guys, they knew
who you were, too.

1082
01:05:15,677 --> 01:05:17,668
The Reaper guy.
The bat man.

1083
01:05:17,746 --> 01:05:20,874
But don't worry about it.
We'll take care of it.
Just trust me.

1084
01:05:20,949 --> 01:05:22,177
<i>Why do they care</i>
<i>who I am?</i>

1085
01:05:22,250 --> 01:05:25,845
They care who you are.
These guys
are crazy, Mr. Montiel.

1086
01:05:28,624 --> 01:05:34,119
Daddy, me and Mike are planning
a trip to go to California
for a month.

1087
01:05:34,196 --> 01:05:38,098
Listen to Antonio, okay?
What do you mean
you wanna go somewhere?

1088
01:05:38,166 --> 01:05:40,191
You wanna go to China,
go to China Town.

1089
01:05:40,268 --> 01:05:42,702
You don't even listen
to anything.

1090
01:05:42,771 --> 01:05:46,036
<i>I'm sorry.</i>
<i>I just feel you're not listening</i>
<i>to what he's saying.</i>

1091
01:05:46,108 --> 01:05:47,769
<i>Sorry, daddy.</i>
<i>I'm serious.</i>

1092
01:05:47,843 --> 01:05:50,505
<i>You said to me that</i>
<i>if I were to leave,</i>

1093
01:05:50,579 --> 01:05:52,774
that you wouldn't talk
to me anymore.

1094
01:05:52,848 --> 01:05:54,975
And if I were to go,
would you not talk to me?

1095
01:05:55,050 --> 01:05:57,018
That's what you said
you were gonna do.

1096
01:05:57,085 --> 01:05:59,610
But you're not going
anywhere, Dito.

1097
01:06:00,956 --> 01:06:05,052
You're not going anywhere.
You stay right here at home
with us, okay?

1098
01:06:05,694 --> 01:06:08,094
<i>Daddy, can you be</i>
<i>my fuckin' father</i>
<i>for a second?</i>

1099
01:06:08,163 --> 01:06:12,327
<i>I wanna go somewhere.</i>
<i>I wanna do something for once.</i>
<i>I can't be here anymore.</i>

1100
01:06:12,401 --> 01:06:13,595
It's a nightmare here.

1101
01:06:13,669 --> 01:06:15,398
<i>What's going on out there?</i>

1102
01:06:15,470 --> 01:06:18,200
Flori, wait a minute.
Everything's gonna be alright.

1103
01:06:18,273 --> 01:06:20,867
Who do you think you are
talking to me like that?

1104
01:06:20,942 --> 01:06:22,068
<i>He's your son.</i>

1105
01:06:22,144 --> 01:06:25,170
Just mind your business.
I told you to mind
your business.

1106
01:06:25,247 --> 01:06:27,306
Alright.
You wanna go,
then go!

1107
01:06:27,382 --> 01:06:29,475
Is that what you wanna hear?
Then go.

1108
01:06:29,551 --> 01:06:31,815
Don't you ever talk to me
like that again.

1109
01:06:31,887 --> 01:06:34,822
Antonio is gonna make
everything right.
Right, Antonio?

1110
01:06:34,890 --> 01:06:38,587
He's gonna make it right. Yes!
He's gonna make it right!

1111
01:06:38,660 --> 01:06:40,059
He's gonna take care, okay?

1112
01:06:40,162 --> 01:06:43,154
Why don't you shut the fuck up?
Listen to him.
Why don't you leave my fuckin house?

1113
01:06:43,965 --> 01:06:46,695
Listen to me.
Antonio, you are going
to make it right?

1114
01:06:46,768 --> 01:06:48,531
You're gonna make it
right, right?

1115
01:06:48,637 --> 01:06:50,832
He's not going nowhere.

1116
01:06:50,906 --> 01:06:54,967
Get the fuck out of my house!
Get the fuck out of my house.

1117
01:06:55,043 --> 01:06:58,308
Hey, hey.
Hey!
What are you doing?

1118
01:06:58,380 --> 01:07:01,076
Get the fuck out.
I hate you!

1119
01:07:01,149 --> 01:07:04,380
<i>What the hell</i>
<i>are you saying to me?</i>
<i>You hate your father?</i>

1120
01:07:05,420 --> 01:07:07,479
<i>Hey, fuck, relax!</i>

1121
01:07:08,790 --> 01:07:09,882
Monty?

1122
01:07:22,437 --> 01:07:23,699
Hold his head!

1123
01:07:29,244 --> 01:07:31,974
<i>Dito, where are you going?</i>

1124
01:07:33,115 --> 01:07:34,377
What is happening?

1125
01:07:42,958 --> 01:07:45,756
You'll be alright.
You'll be alright.

1126
01:07:47,295 --> 01:07:48,785
You'll be alright.

1127
01:08:47,589 --> 01:08:49,147
Dito.

1128
01:08:51,226 --> 01:08:52,716
Hi.

1129
01:08:54,029 --> 01:08:56,122
Dito.

1130
01:08:56,198 --> 01:08:57,688
Come here.

1131
01:09:03,738 --> 01:09:05,330
Look at you.

1132
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:07,034
You're beautiful.

1133
01:09:13,315 --> 01:09:14,942
Momma, you do.

1134
01:09:21,389 --> 01:09:22,378
Monty?

1135
01:09:24,392 --> 01:09:27,361
Monty.
Look who's here.

1136
01:09:33,235 --> 01:09:35,726
Hey.
Look at you.

1137
01:09:35,804 --> 01:09:37,362
Long time no see.

1138
01:09:45,013 --> 01:09:46,173
Daddy.

1139
01:09:47,082 --> 01:09:49,642
Antonio and Nerf called.
Said you were sick.

1140
01:09:52,888 --> 01:09:55,652
Me?
Rock of Gibraltar, man.

1141
01:10:03,431 --> 01:10:05,058
You don't look so good.

1142
01:10:09,070 --> 01:10:12,597
He came all this way to tell me
I don't look so good, Flori?

1143
01:10:16,745 --> 01:10:18,076
No.

1144
01:10:19,147 --> 01:10:23,140
He's here to take you
to the hospital
because you're sick, right?

1145
01:10:27,422 --> 01:10:31,017
Well... thanks for coming.
You take care, okay?

1146
01:10:31,993 --> 01:10:33,358
Take care?

1147
01:10:33,428 --> 01:10:35,362
When I came
all the way here
to see you?

1148
01:10:35,430 --> 01:10:38,558
<i>Dito, it's nice</i>
<i>to see you again.</i>

1149
01:10:38,633 --> 01:10:40,863
You came and everything.
Now you take care.

1150
01:10:40,936 --> 01:10:42,995
I see what he's doing.

1151
01:10:43,772 --> 01:10:46,570
<i>Nice.</i>
<i>I see what you're doing.</i>

1152
01:10:47,208 --> 01:10:49,574
That's because
you're a very smart guy.

1153
01:10:49,644 --> 01:10:53,978
<i>Well, I'm your son.</i>
<i>You know that, right?</i>

1154
01:10:54,049 --> 01:10:55,482
<i>You're my son?</i>

1155
01:10:55,550 --> 01:10:57,074
Yeah, I'm your son.
Remember?

1156
01:10:57,152 --> 01:11:00,212
<i>You're my son?</i>
<i>You're not my son.</i>

1157
01:11:03,224 --> 01:11:05,488
I'm not gonna fight.

1158
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:07,084
You want me to leave?

1159
01:11:07,162 --> 01:11:09,027
<i>Big shot comes here.</i>

1160
01:11:10,532 --> 01:11:14,059
<i>Comes 15,</i>
<i>comes 3,000 miles.</i>

1161
01:11:14,135 --> 01:11:18,663
<i>From co--</i>
<i>Comes 3,000 miles</i>
<i>in 15 years.</i>

1162
01:11:18,740 --> 01:11:22,073
<i>You go back to California</i>
<i>like the rat you are.</i>

1163
01:11:22,143 --> 01:11:25,544
You leave me,
your mother.

1164
01:11:25,613 --> 01:11:28,639
<i>You don't see</i>
<i>your friend Antonio.</i>

1165
01:11:28,717 --> 01:11:29,911
Monty.

1166
01:11:29,985 --> 01:11:33,250
<i>Not once!</i>
<i>Once!</i>

1167
01:11:36,391 --> 01:11:39,451
You can go.
You take care.

1168
01:12:18,433 --> 01:12:21,334
Used to be Antonio's house.

1169
01:12:21,403 --> 01:12:23,871
House of horrors.
The poor kid.

1170
01:12:25,907 --> 01:12:28,398
Look how nice
it is now.

1171
01:12:28,476 --> 01:12:30,137
It's nice, huh?

1172
01:12:34,949 --> 01:12:38,476
I wasn't upset
when he went to prison.
Not a bit.

1173
01:12:38,553 --> 01:12:40,851
That's where me
and you father are different.

1174
01:12:44,292 --> 01:12:50,253
You know, if you hooked
your father up
to a lie detector test

1175
01:12:50,331 --> 01:12:55,166
and asked if he was
the best father
whoever lived ever,

1176
01:12:55,236 --> 01:12:57,966
he'd pass with flying colors.

1177
01:12:59,574 --> 01:13:03,601
That's because he loved you
with everything he had.

1178
01:13:03,678 --> 01:13:06,476
Every last bit.
He loved you.

1179
01:13:07,782 --> 01:13:10,148
He loved coming up here
with you.

1180
01:13:13,421 --> 01:13:16,857
You know, people used to think
he was your grandfather.

1181
01:13:17,926 --> 01:13:20,087
He thought that was funny.

1182
01:13:20,161 --> 01:13:25,463
You know, one generation
can be funny, I guess.
But two?

1183
01:13:25,533 --> 01:13:28,798
We were too old
to have such a young boy.

1184
01:13:32,807 --> 01:13:38,211
We needed you probably more
than you needed us.
Or, you know.

1185
01:13:39,514 --> 01:13:42,074
Your father was so crazy
about you.

1186
01:13:42,150 --> 01:13:44,744
I never saw nothing like it.

1187
01:13:47,355 --> 01:13:49,550
You were more his buddy
than a son.

1188
01:13:49,624 --> 01:13:52,388
He couldn't wait for you
to come out and play.

1189
01:13:56,531 --> 01:13:58,226
I'm sorry, Ma.

1190
01:14:00,468 --> 01:14:05,496
You can't come back
with hatred for your father.
You can't.

1191
01:14:06,708 --> 01:14:11,907
How could you love him so much
in that book and not see him
for so long?

1192
01:14:16,417 --> 01:14:18,908
I know you have your reasons.

1193
01:14:21,022 --> 01:14:23,081
We all missed you here.

1194
01:14:24,492 --> 01:14:26,255
You're my son, too.

1195
01:14:31,833 --> 01:14:33,266
Look at you.

1196
01:14:35,870 --> 01:14:37,667
You're a man now.

1197
01:14:50,552 --> 01:14:52,884
It's good to see you again.

1198
01:14:54,689 --> 01:14:57,556
To say your name
to you.

1199
01:15:09,737 --> 01:15:12,763
I thought of this every day,
and now it's here.

1200
01:15:14,042 --> 01:15:15,634
Every day.

1201
01:15:27,288 --> 01:15:28,619
You asked your dad, right?

1202
01:15:29,958 --> 01:15:32,893
How can we afford California?

1203
01:15:34,862 --> 01:15:36,056
Frank.

1204
01:15:36,130 --> 01:15:39,725
Remember the commercial
you told me about?
You told me about that.

1205
01:15:40,501 --> 01:15:42,867
I saw it.
The $39-buses.

1206
01:15:43,771 --> 01:15:45,796
We get the money from Frank
and we can go.

1207
01:15:48,109 --> 01:15:51,044
Hey, Ronnie,
give her her shirt back.

1208
01:15:51,112 --> 01:15:53,603
I just wanna get
the fuck out of here.

1209
01:15:54,749 --> 01:15:57,980
I'm not gonna go without you.
And we're going, right?

1210
01:15:59,220 --> 01:16:00,517
Yeah.

1211
01:16:03,024 --> 01:16:04,616
I want my fuckin' shirt back.

1212
01:16:04,692 --> 01:16:07,183
Can you give her back
her frigging shirt?

1213
01:16:07,262 --> 01:16:11,392
<i>I'm serious, Ronnie.</i>
<i>I'm serious.</i>
<i>Ronnie!</i>

1214
01:16:14,636 --> 01:16:18,629
Ronnie!
Give her the fuckin'
shirt back.

1215
01:16:18,706 --> 01:16:21,971
Why you do this every time?
Fuckin' little pervert.

1216
01:16:22,610 --> 01:16:23,804
Here.

1217
01:16:23,878 --> 01:16:26,642
<i>I gave you your shirt.</i>
<i>Tell your friend</i>
<i>to talk to me.</i>

1218
01:16:26,714 --> 01:16:28,841
Your friend has a mind
of her own.

1219
01:16:28,916 --> 01:16:30,747
Tell your mind
to talk to me.

1220
01:16:30,818 --> 01:16:34,914
My mind is not
gonna talk to you.
I don't wanna talk to you.

1221
01:16:34,989 --> 01:16:37,287
<i>You don't think</i>
<i>I'm not gonna get</i>
<i>in there now?</i>

1222
01:16:37,358 --> 01:16:38,723
<i>You're not gonna get in.</i>

1223
01:16:42,997 --> 01:16:45,090
You didn't think
I was gonna get in?

1224
01:16:45,900 --> 01:16:47,128
Huh?

1225
01:16:49,337 --> 01:16:52,738
I'm sorry, Laurie.
At my fuckin' house
I didn't mean to--

1226
01:16:55,643 --> 01:16:56,940
I didn't mean to.

1227
01:16:57,011 --> 01:17:00,003
You were so mean to me.
You were really mean to me.

1228
01:17:00,081 --> 01:17:01,275
I was pissed off.

1229
01:17:01,349 --> 01:17:04,079
I was pissed off.
I lost it, you know.
I fuckin'--

1230
01:17:06,587 --> 01:17:07,952
What is that?

1231
01:17:09,257 --> 01:17:11,782
Is that a bruise?
I did that to you?

1232
01:17:11,859 --> 01:17:13,292
Yeah.

1233
01:17:13,361 --> 01:17:15,386
Don't worry.
I bruise easily.
It's fine.

1234
01:17:15,463 --> 01:17:16,760
When I grabbed you?

1235
01:17:17,999 --> 01:17:19,432
Yo, Dito.

1236
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:23,994
The Reaper's over there.
Let's go.
Get up out of the pool.

1237
01:17:24,072 --> 01:17:28,202
<i>Antonio found the dude</i>
<i>that hit you with the bat.</i>
<i>He's waiting for you.</i>

1238
01:17:28,276 --> 01:17:30,540
Come on!

1239
01:17:30,611 --> 01:17:32,738
You going over there
is so fuckin' stupid.

1240
01:17:32,814 --> 01:17:34,372
Let's go!
Dito, come on, man.

1241
01:17:34,449 --> 01:17:38,010
You don't need
that fuckin' asshole.
He is the fuckin' worst!

1242
01:17:38,086 --> 01:17:41,283
<i>Where are you going?</i>
<i>You're so full of shit, man.</i>

1243
01:17:41,356 --> 01:17:44,450
You wanna get out of here,
but you're running
after Antonio.

1244
01:17:44,525 --> 01:17:48,484
<i>The guy's a fuckin' dick, Dito.</i>
<i>It's because of him</i>
<i>you're fucked up.</i>

1245
01:17:48,563 --> 01:17:50,690
Fuckin' go then!
Go!

1246
01:17:50,765 --> 01:17:51,754
<i>I'll be right back.</i>

1247
01:17:51,833 --> 01:17:53,698
You're not coming back!

1248
01:18:15,823 --> 01:18:17,484
What's up, Dito?

1249
01:18:17,558 --> 01:18:19,958
The fuckin' spic
is right there, man.

1250
01:18:21,596 --> 01:18:23,029
Nerf told you, right?

1251
01:18:23,097 --> 01:18:24,325
Yeah.

1252
01:18:24,399 --> 01:18:26,367
That's our motherfucker
right there.

1253
01:18:30,071 --> 01:18:32,096
He's in there playing Asteroids.

1254
01:18:37,412 --> 01:18:39,039
Yo, get down.
Get down.

1255
01:18:42,316 --> 01:18:44,443
Yeah, let him go.
Let him go.

1256
01:18:49,190 --> 01:18:50,987
He'll be there
all alone.

1257
01:18:52,827 --> 01:18:54,692
I'm gonna show this fucker
what's up.

1258
01:19:41,843 --> 01:19:43,572
<i>Frank?</i>

1259
01:19:44,712 --> 01:19:46,236
<i>Frank?</i>

1260
01:20:01,362 --> 01:20:02,420
Oh, shit.

1261
01:20:04,899 --> 01:20:07,891
<i>What's up?</i>
<i>Is it Saturday?</i>

1262
01:20:09,403 --> 01:20:10,870
It ain't Saturday, Frank.

1263
01:20:12,406 --> 01:20:14,840
Sit down.
Sit down.

1264
01:20:17,211 --> 01:20:20,578
Frank, we need our money.
Remember I was telling you--

1265
01:20:20,648 --> 01:20:23,811
<i>You guys know</i>
<i>this shit's no good.</i>
<i>Huh?</i>

1266
01:20:23,885 --> 01:20:27,286
You like this song?
You can hear it, right?

1267
01:20:28,022 --> 01:20:29,319
<i>Listen, listen, listen.</i>

1268
01:20:31,359 --> 01:20:33,850
Oh, fuck!
Did you hear that?

1269
01:20:34,462 --> 01:20:35,793
Did you hear that?

1270
01:20:37,164 --> 01:20:39,655
<i>It's like--</i>
<i>Oh, I love it.</i>

1271
01:20:44,639 --> 01:20:45,833
<i>Right?</i>

1272
01:20:50,545 --> 01:20:52,979
<i>And these things</i>
<i>like fuckin' ultrasonic.</i>

1273
01:20:53,047 --> 01:20:55,572
<i>They're like</i>
<i>walkie talkie shit.</i>
<i>But in your head.</i>

1274
01:20:55,650 --> 01:20:58,847
Like, it sounds there
but it's in here, too.
You know what I mean?

1275
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:01,855
It sounds there
but it's in here, too.
You know what I mean?

1276
01:21:01,923 --> 01:21:03,982
<i>Walkie talkie shit,</i>
<i>I'm telling ya.</i>

1277
01:21:04,058 --> 01:21:08,495
<i>Out there, in here.</i>
<i>Out there, in here.</i>
<i>It's amazing.</i>

1278
01:21:08,563 --> 01:21:12,795
Frank, you ain't paid us
for three weeks.

1279
01:21:12,867 --> 01:21:16,359
<i>Damn.</i>
<i>This shit is impossible!</i>
<i>You hear that?</i>

1280
01:21:21,142 --> 01:21:24,202
Come on, Frank.
We know the fuckin' money's
in the fridge.

1281
01:21:24,278 --> 01:21:28,214
Fucking great song.
I love this song.

1282
01:21:28,282 --> 01:21:30,307
I love this song.

1283
01:21:30,384 --> 01:21:34,616
Frank, enough shit already.
The fuckin' money's
in the fridge.

1284
01:21:35,423 --> 01:21:38,358
<i>Either you get it for us</i>
<i>or we're gonna take it.</i>

1285
01:21:38,993 --> 01:21:40,517
What are you gonna do?

1286
01:21:42,730 --> 01:21:43,992
Wait.

1287
01:21:45,466 --> 01:21:47,991
Mikey, you came here
to rob me?

1288
01:21:48,069 --> 01:21:50,435
<i>Frank, we're friends, man.</i>

1289
01:21:50,504 --> 01:21:52,301
I didn't come
to rob you.

1290
01:21:52,373 --> 01:21:54,807
<i>Frank, we didn't come here</i>
<i>to rob you.</i>

1291
01:21:54,875 --> 01:21:56,740
<i>We just want</i>
<i>to get paid, you know.</i>

1292
01:21:56,811 --> 01:21:59,336
<i>You haven't paid us</i>
<i>for three fuckin' weeks.</i>

1293
01:21:59,947 --> 01:22:02,313
Three weeks?
I haven't paid you
in three weeks?

1294
01:22:07,355 --> 01:22:08,879
Okay.

1295
01:22:08,956 --> 01:22:11,584
I mean, it's cool.
It's cool.
I owe you money.

1296
01:22:11,659 --> 01:22:13,627
<i>I mean, you know,</i>

1297
01:22:16,998 --> 01:22:18,625
<i>I got a gun in here too,</i>
<i>you know.</i>

1298
01:22:20,668 --> 01:22:22,659
And if you rob me,
you know,

1299
01:22:24,105 --> 01:22:26,437
<i>I would've had</i>
<i>to have used it.</i>

1300
01:22:28,309 --> 01:22:31,039
But I wouldn't.
I would never.
I'm sorry.

1301
01:22:32,213 --> 01:22:33,646
<i>How much do I owe you?</i>

1302
01:22:35,182 --> 01:22:36,410
Three hundred for both.

1303
01:22:36,484 --> 01:22:37,917
<i>Three hundred.</i>

1304
01:22:39,854 --> 01:22:41,481
You know what?

1305
01:22:42,757 --> 01:22:45,055
Take it all, Mike.
Take it all.

1306
01:22:45,126 --> 01:22:48,823
It's only $300, Frank.
All we want is what we're owed.
We're not asking--

1307
01:22:50,031 --> 01:22:53,899
Like Job.
Remember from the Bible?

1308
01:22:54,735 --> 01:22:58,068
Like him.
You're so good, Mikey.
You're so good.

1309
01:22:58,139 --> 01:23:01,802
<i>But here is no good anymore.</i>
<i>Here is no good.</i>

1310
01:23:01,876 --> 01:23:05,812
You're always talking
about the music,
or California.

1311
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:08,678
Here's no good anymore, okay?

1312
01:23:08,749 --> 01:23:12,617
Here's no good anymore.
Take it!
Just take the money, please.

1313
01:23:12,687 --> 01:23:13,676
Take the money.

1314
01:23:13,754 --> 01:23:15,415
<i>It's time to go.</i>
<i>Listen to Dito!</i>

1315
01:23:15,489 --> 01:23:18,151
He knows when it's time to go!

1316
01:23:18,225 --> 01:23:19,920
It's time to go.

1317
01:23:20,961 --> 01:23:24,419
<i>Mikey... it's time to go.</i>

1318
01:23:27,401 --> 01:23:28,800
Take it.

1319
01:23:30,337 --> 01:23:31,702
Take it.

1320
01:23:37,144 --> 01:23:38,611
Take it all.

1321
01:23:40,581 --> 01:23:41,912
Take it all.

1322
01:23:42,850 --> 01:23:44,283
It's time to go.

1323
01:23:59,467 --> 01:24:04,427
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>
<i>That's me.</i>

1324
01:24:05,139 --> 01:24:06,367
Yeah.

1325
01:24:10,978 --> 01:24:16,280
<i>No conscience.</i>
<i>No conscience.</i>
<i>These motherfuckers.</i>

1326
01:24:18,753 --> 01:24:22,154
<i>Do what they want.</i>
<i>Do exactly what they want.</i>

1327
01:24:27,261 --> 01:24:30,958
<i>No conscience.</i>
<i>No conscience.</i>
<i>These motherfuckers.</i>

1328
01:24:31,599 --> 01:24:34,727
<i>You show them what's up.</i>
<i>What's right.</i>

1329
01:24:37,171 --> 01:24:39,571
<i>You go, boy.</i>
<i>You go.</i>

1330
01:24:45,479 --> 01:24:46,468
<i>Pow!</i>

1331
01:25:03,164 --> 01:25:05,928
<i>I was afraid maybe</i>
<i>you drowned in here</i>
<i>or something.</i>

1332
01:25:13,407 --> 01:25:15,432
<i>Listen, Dito.</i>

1333
01:25:17,511 --> 01:25:21,641
Uhm, you know,
this thing with Antonio,
you know,

1334
01:25:26,787 --> 01:25:28,687
<i>you know, don't worry.</i>

1335
01:25:30,157 --> 01:25:31,488
You're kids.

1336
01:25:31,559 --> 01:25:34,119
I spoke to the guy,
the guy with the suit.

1337
01:25:34,195 --> 01:25:36,163
<i>He said everything</i>
<i>is gonna be okay.</i>

1338
01:25:36,230 --> 01:25:38,562
It's gonna be good.
He's gonna take care of it.

1339
01:25:38,632 --> 01:25:40,896
I'm not worried
about it.
Okay?

1340
01:25:44,338 --> 01:25:47,739
I'm sorry I ran away
when you had the seizure, dad.

1341
01:25:54,748 --> 01:25:55,840
Don't worry.

1342
01:25:56,550 --> 01:25:58,484
<i>Monday, instead</i>
<i>of going to school,</i>

1343
01:25:58,552 --> 01:26:01,783
<i>you take your ID card.</i>
<i>You go to Riker's Island,</i>
<i>you see Antonio.</i>

1344
01:26:01,856 --> 01:26:03,915
Take your friend Mike.
He's a good kid.

1345
01:26:04,992 --> 01:26:06,926
Daddy, I wanted
to tell you that--

1346
01:26:06,994 --> 01:26:09,690
<i>I know.</i>
<i>I just want you</i>
<i>to understand everything.</i>

1347
01:26:09,763 --> 01:26:13,028
I like Antonio.
Yeah.

1348
01:26:13,100 --> 01:26:15,625
Why don't you ever listen
to anything I ever say?

1349
01:26:15,703 --> 01:26:17,762
<i>I'm listening to you.</i>
<i>Listen to me.</i>

1350
01:26:17,838 --> 01:26:21,001
<i>It's gonna be okay.</i>
<i>Alright?</i>

1351
01:26:23,344 --> 01:26:24,606
Don't fuckin' touch me.

1352
01:26:24,678 --> 01:26:25,667
Listen to me.

1353
01:26:25,746 --> 01:26:28,738
Get the fuck off me!
Don't touch me.
Don't fuckin' touch me.

1354
01:26:28,816 --> 01:26:31,046
<i>Don't you talk</i>
<i>to me like that!</i>

1355
01:26:31,118 --> 01:26:34,144
Don't you raise
your voice to me!

1356
01:26:34,221 --> 01:26:36,815
Your my son.
Come on.
Dito.

1357
01:26:36,891 --> 01:26:38,552
Get the fuck off me!

1358
01:26:38,626 --> 01:26:42,562
What's the matter with you?
It's gonna be alright.
Do you hear what I'm saying?

1359
01:26:42,630 --> 01:26:45,155
It's gonna be okay.
It will be okay.

1360
01:26:45,232 --> 01:26:49,430
My friend Mike just died, dad.
He just got fuckin' shot.
You don't know what's happening.

1361
01:26:49,503 --> 01:26:51,494
What are you talking about?
What happened?

1362
01:26:51,572 --> 01:26:53,767
My friend Mike is dead.

1363
01:26:53,841 --> 01:26:54,933
Come here.

1364
01:26:55,009 --> 01:26:58,206
Don't fuckin' touch me!
Please, get the fuck off me!

1365
01:26:58,279 --> 01:26:59,940
What is the matter
with you?

1366
01:27:00,014 --> 01:27:02,175
You don't raise your hands
to your father!

1367
01:27:02,249 --> 01:27:05,776
You don't raise your hands
to your father.
I love you.

1368
01:27:05,853 --> 01:27:08,344
I'm asking you
not to fuckin' touch me!

1369
01:27:08,422 --> 01:27:11,050
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.

1370
01:27:12,626 --> 01:27:15,288
Don't you fuckin' do it!

1371
01:27:15,362 --> 01:27:18,160
Don't you raise your hands
to me again!

1372
01:27:18,933 --> 01:27:20,628
I'm your father.

1373
01:27:21,402 --> 01:27:24,132
You're not supposed
to hate your father.

1374
01:27:24,204 --> 01:27:26,229
When are you my father?

1375
01:27:28,108 --> 01:27:30,338
When are you my father?

1376
01:27:52,967 --> 01:27:54,559
<i>You know, I, uh,</i>

1377
01:27:55,336 --> 01:27:59,568
<i>I waited around for a year</i>
<i>at my window when you left.</i>

1378
01:28:00,240 --> 01:28:03,767
I bought California maps.

1379
01:28:03,844 --> 01:28:06,642
Any time I heard
anything about it,
I would think of you.

1380
01:28:07,982 --> 01:28:09,643
Embarrassing.

1381
01:28:12,119 --> 01:28:13,552
Dumb little girl.

1382
01:28:16,957 --> 01:28:20,393
Listen, I'm not heartbroken
about it, alright?
I'm over that shit.

1383
01:28:21,562 --> 01:28:24,690
I was just a dumb girl.
We were fuckin' kids.
Whatever.

1384
01:28:25,232 --> 01:28:27,700
But you need to take
your father to the hospital.

1385
01:28:30,371 --> 01:28:31,861
<i>I mean, your mother--</i>

1386
01:28:34,408 --> 01:28:36,171
<i>I'm serious.</i>

1387
01:28:37,778 --> 01:28:40,269
<i>I got a little boy.</i>
<i>He's a good kid.</i>

1388
01:28:40,347 --> 01:28:42,781
<i>And he's gonna look after me</i>
<i>when we're older.</i>

1389
01:28:44,618 --> 01:28:49,021
<i>So you look after your mother.</i>
<i>You take care of your father.</i>
<i>You take care of your mother.</i>

1390
01:28:49,990 --> 01:28:53,016
It's real simple.
'Cause she's a good woman.

1391
01:28:53,093 --> 01:28:54,526
It's not a fuckin' stretch.

1392
01:28:54,595 --> 01:28:56,756
I know what you're saying.
Alright?

1393
01:28:56,830 --> 01:28:58,855
Thanks for coming.
I should go.

1394
01:28:59,767 --> 01:29:00,927
<i>Wow.</i>

1395
01:29:03,904 --> 01:29:05,838
Monty's son.

1396
01:29:07,908 --> 01:29:10,274
<i>You know what?</i>
<i>You're Flori's son as well.</i>

1397
01:29:10,344 --> 01:29:12,209
<i>And that's why</i>
<i>you're all fucked up.</i>

1398
01:29:12,279 --> 01:29:13,473
Yeah, I'm all fucked up.

1399
01:29:13,580 --> 01:29:17,311
You think you're going?
You're gonna fuckin' leave?
Go ahead, fuckin' go.

1400
01:29:18,452 --> 01:29:19,851
You're not gonna go.

1401
01:29:21,221 --> 01:29:24,554
You didn't fuckin' come
all the way over
so you could leave again.

1402
01:29:24,625 --> 01:29:26,024
<i>You don't know.</i>

1403
01:29:26,093 --> 01:29:29,153
You don't know
what it was like
in the house, okay?

1404
01:29:29,830 --> 01:29:31,821
Listen.
You want it straight?

1405
01:29:31,899 --> 01:29:35,335
'Cause I'm the only one
who's gonna tell you
for some fuckin' reason.

1406
01:29:35,402 --> 01:29:39,031
You killed him.
You killed your father
when you left.

1407
01:29:40,274 --> 01:29:42,469
Are you hearing me?
You fuckin' killed him.

1408
01:29:42,543 --> 01:29:45,637
You left a trail of blood
when you left.

1409
01:29:45,712 --> 01:29:49,239
So forget me.
Forget all this shit.
Forget it, alright?

1410
01:29:49,316 --> 01:29:52,149
You killed your mother
and you killed your father.

1411
01:29:52,219 --> 01:29:54,949
And for the past
fuckin' 20 years
he's been dying,

1412
01:29:55,022 --> 01:29:57,456
just waiting for you
to come home.

1413
01:29:57,524 --> 01:29:59,890
Say daddy, you're fucked up.
I hate your guts.

1414
01:29:59,960 --> 01:30:03,157
Whatever you need to get out
of your angsty little
fuckin' head.

1415
01:30:03,230 --> 01:30:06,063
Touch my head
one more fuckin' time
and I'm gonna go nuts.

1416
01:30:06,133 --> 01:30:08,158
Go ahead.
Go fuckin' nuts.

1417
01:30:08,235 --> 01:30:11,796
Go fuckin' nuts.
Let it out!
Stop fuckin' running away.

1418
01:30:11,872 --> 01:30:15,933
You think you're a man?
That's just a fuckin' tail
between your legs.

1419
01:30:16,009 --> 01:30:18,170
Go home
and take care
of your mother.

1420
01:30:18,245 --> 01:30:20,042
Go home
and take care
of your father.

1421
01:30:20,114 --> 01:30:22,742
That's gonna make you
a fuckin' man.

1422
01:30:22,816 --> 01:30:24,579
That's all you've got left.

1423
01:30:24,651 --> 01:30:27,518
'Cause if you don't do
that shit, it's too fuckin' late.

1424
01:30:27,588 --> 01:30:28,714
Okay, bye.

1425
01:30:28,789 --> 01:30:30,154
Yeah.

1426
01:30:35,596 --> 01:30:37,086
<i>You're going</i>
<i>to hospital.</i>

1427
01:30:37,164 --> 01:30:38,597
Where's Ma?

1428
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:41,627
Ma?
Where is she?

1429
01:30:41,702 --> 01:30:43,135
<i>Why don't you get out?</i>

1430
01:30:44,938 --> 01:30:46,064
Get out of the house.

1431
01:30:46,140 --> 01:30:48,370
<i>Did you love me?</i>
<i>Ever?</i>

1432
01:30:48,442 --> 01:30:49,568
<i>I said go.</i>

1433
01:30:49,643 --> 01:30:51,907
Dad, did you love me
or not?

1434
01:30:51,979 --> 01:30:53,412
Daddy, I gotta know.

1435
01:30:54,414 --> 01:30:57,679
Lie to me and tell me you did.
Let me feel like
the piece of shit I am.

1436
01:30:57,751 --> 01:30:59,480
Did you love me
or not?

1437
01:31:01,255 --> 01:31:03,314
Answer me!

1438
01:31:03,390 --> 01:31:04,448
<i>A father always--</i>

1439
01:31:04,525 --> 01:31:06,652
Not a father!
You!

1440
01:31:19,506 --> 01:31:21,371
Of course I did.

1441
01:31:35,155 --> 01:31:38,090
I told you I loved you
the last time I saw you.

1442
01:31:50,771 --> 01:31:53,865
<i>I love you, Dito.</i>
<i>Alright?</i>

1443
01:31:53,941 --> 01:31:56,273
<i>You're my son.</i>
<i>I'm very proud of you.</i>

1444
01:31:58,612 --> 01:31:59,943
<i>Now, Antonio,</i>

1445
01:32:01,548 --> 01:32:04,517
<i>he doesn't have anybody</i>
<i>to tell him something</i>
<i>like this.</i>

1446
01:32:08,021 --> 01:32:12,185
<i>Listen, Monday</i>
<i>you don't have</i>
<i>to go to school.</i>

1447
01:32:13,594 --> 01:32:16,563
<i>Monday you take your ID.</i>

1448
01:32:18,232 --> 01:32:19,824
<i>You go to Riker's.</i>

1449
01:32:20,867 --> 01:32:22,562
<i>You see Antonio.</i>

1450
01:32:24,304 --> 01:32:26,169
<i>Take your friend Mike with you.</i>

1451
01:32:27,641 --> 01:32:29,336
<i>I like that kid.</i>

1452
01:32:31,411 --> 01:32:33,845
<i>You take the bus there</i>
<i>with your friend.</i>

1453
01:32:34,481 --> 01:32:35,880
<i>You go see Antonio.</i>

1454
01:32:35,949 --> 01:32:37,382
Yeah, man.

1455
01:32:40,387 --> 01:32:41,581
Have fun.

1456
01:32:44,091 --> 01:32:45,888
<i>You're just kids, Dito.</i>

1457
01:32:46,927 --> 01:32:48,918
<i>Just kids.</i>

1458
01:32:50,664 --> 01:32:54,760
<i>But your friend Antonio,</i>
<i>he needs you now.</i>

1459
01:32:56,270 --> 01:32:59,262
<i>'Cause he don't have anybody</i>
<i>to tell him what I just told you.</i>

1460
01:33:22,929 --> 01:33:24,021
Come here.

1461
01:33:26,900 --> 01:33:29,391
<i>Okay, enough.</i>

1462
01:33:39,046 --> 01:33:41,071
Thank you for coming.

1463
01:33:42,115 --> 01:33:44,208
I know I'm in the middle
of no place, right?

1464
01:33:44,284 --> 01:33:48,186
No, no.
I-- I should've come,
you know, a long time go.

1465
01:33:48,255 --> 01:33:50,086
<i>It's alright.</i>

1466
01:33:58,165 --> 01:33:59,894
Damn, Dito.

1467
01:34:03,337 --> 01:34:05,498
I got so much
I wanna say to you.

1468
01:34:09,710 --> 01:34:11,735
I just don't know
what to say.

1469
01:34:32,366 --> 01:34:34,891
<i>I don't know what I was</i>
<i>expecting to happen.</i>

1470
01:34:38,372 --> 01:34:40,306
<i>Antonio exists.</i>

1471
01:34:41,375 --> 01:34:42,842
<i>Crazy, huh?</i>

1472
01:34:45,145 --> 01:34:48,046
<i>In the end,</i>
<i>just like I said,</i>

1473
01:34:49,082 --> 01:34:51,880
<i>I left everything</i>
<i>and everyone,</i>

1474
01:34:53,320 --> 01:34:54,912
<i>but no one.</i>

1475
01:34:55,689 --> 01:34:59,022
<i>No one</i>
<i>has ever left me.</i>

1476
01:39:07,207 --> 01:39:09,232
Poor Antonio.

1477
01:39:10,944 --> 01:39:12,707
He's in for life.

1478
01:39:14,447 --> 01:39:17,143
<i>Maybe he'll get out.</i>

1479
01:39:18,318 --> 01:39:21,310
Yeah, but he's got
a bad temper.

1480
01:39:23,189 --> 01:39:25,953
With a bad temper
you can't be out of here.

1481
01:39:27,260 --> 01:39:29,990
<i>He's a good guy, though.</i>
<i>He's a good guy, though.</i>

1482
01:39:30,063 --> 01:39:31,826
Oh, yeah.
I like him.

1483
01:39:34,934 --> 01:39:37,732
But good guys
don't get out of here.

1484
01:39:40,607 --> 01:39:44,407
<i>They won't change.</i>
<i>Not to worry, you know.</i>
