1
00:00:55,238 --> 00:00:56,967
Oh, Peter, come in.

2
00:00:57,006 --> 00:00:59,167
- Swing heil, Joseph.
- Swing heil.

3
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:07,145
Ow! Oh ho ho!

4
00:01:07,183 --> 00:01:08,548
Aah!

5
00:01:17,093 --> 00:01:18,651
Anna, we have to dance tonight.

6
00:01:18,695 --> 00:01:20,993
- OK.
- There they are.

7
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:22,861
<i>OK, OK,
you've got Shaw...</i>

8
00:01:22,899 --> 00:01:24,867
- Hey!
- The Clambake 7...

9
00:01:24,901 --> 00:01:26,493
- Herr Hitman. Otto.
- Peter.

10
00:01:26,536 --> 00:01:29,061
- What's doing, you reefed-up...
- Thomas.

11
00:01:29,105 --> 00:01:30,572
Try to understand this.

12
00:01:30,607 --> 00:01:32,302
Dorsey's trumpet is great
when he's playing sweet.

13
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:33,468
Sweet.

14
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:36,034
But he doesn't ride, man.
Do you understand?

15
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:39,775
<i>Let's work tonight! Yeah!</i>

16
00:01:43,152 --> 00:01:44,278
Aah!

17
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,414
Whoo!

18
00:01:47,457 --> 00:01:50,358
Thomas, come and dance.

19
00:02:10,246 --> 00:02:13,147
What do you say?
- Whoo!

20
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,924
<i>Yeah! Whoo!</i>

21
00:02:28,498 --> 00:02:30,125
<i>Yeah!</i>

22
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:31,997
<i>Whoo!</i>

23
00:02:32,035 --> 00:02:34,265
<i>Yeah!</i>

24
00:02:34,304 --> 00:02:36,738
<i>Yeah! Whoo!</i>

25
00:02:50,787 --> 00:02:52,186
Whoo!

26
00:03:04,167 --> 00:03:05,327
<i>Thomas, we'll miss the tram.</i>

27
00:03:05,368 --> 00:03:06,926
<i>- Take it slow, Otto.
- See you, Otto.</i>

28
00:03:06,969 --> 00:03:08,732
What, you didn't like Helga?

29
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:11,865
You know Herr Hitman
seemed to hit it off with her.

30
00:03:11,908 --> 00:03:14,342
What? I did not.
I was just being nice.

31
00:03:14,377 --> 00:03:15,844
"I was just being nice. "

32
00:03:15,878 --> 00:03:20,212
Hell, we've already missed it.
We're walking again.

33
00:03:20,249 --> 00:03:23,184
You want to race down
to Macken Bridge?

34
00:03:23,219 --> 00:03:25,210
No, let's just walk.

35
00:03:25,254 --> 00:03:28,485
- Well, I beat you last time.
- That's not true.

36
00:03:28,524 --> 00:03:29,889
That is true.
I believe I beat you right...

37
00:03:29,926 --> 00:03:31,120
I beat you last time.

38
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,594
I believe I beat you
right down to your socks.

39
00:03:35,698 --> 00:03:37,723
Go!

40
00:03:37,767 --> 00:03:39,564
Last one on's an H.J. Pansy!

41
00:03:39,602 --> 00:03:41,797
Hey!

42
00:03:46,943 --> 00:03:48,171
Peter!

43
00:04:01,224 --> 00:04:03,886
Thomas!

44
00:04:03,926 --> 00:04:05,484
Damn it.

45
00:04:08,431 --> 00:04:09,864
Aah!

46
00:04:09,899 --> 00:04:11,890
- We're gangsters.
- We're cowboys.

47
00:04:13,403 --> 00:04:14,836
You're idiots.

48
00:04:14,871 --> 00:04:15,997
Arvid.

49
00:04:16,038 --> 00:04:17,665
Oh, come on, Herr Hitman.
We love you.

50
00:04:17,707 --> 00:04:20,005
Leave me alone.

51
00:04:20,042 --> 00:04:23,671
You didn't have to wait for me.
I can take care of myself.

52
00:04:23,713 --> 00:04:24,839
Ooh.

53
00:04:24,881 --> 00:04:26,746
Oh, you think it's funny?

54
00:04:26,783 --> 00:04:28,751
- Yes, please.
- Aha!

55
00:04:28,785 --> 00:04:30,275
All right. Come on.

56
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:32,344
I have to unload.

57
00:04:32,388 --> 00:04:34,913
En garde. Try it.
Come on, try. You can't...

58
00:04:34,957 --> 00:04:37,755
<i>When I was kid
'bout half past three</i>

59
00:04:37,794 --> 00:04:40,524
<i>My daddy said,
son, come here to me</i>

60
00:04:40,563 --> 00:04:43,896
<i>Said things may come,
and things may go</i>

61
00:04:43,933 --> 00:04:46,868
<i>But this is one thing
you ought to know</i>

62
00:04:46,903 --> 00:04:48,302
<i>Tain't what you do</i>

63
00:04:48,337 --> 00:04:49,770
<i>It's the way
that you do it</i>

64
00:04:49,806 --> 00:04:51,068
<i>Tain't what you do</i>

65
00:04:51,107 --> 00:04:53,234
<i>It's the way
that you do it</i>

66
00:04:53,276 --> 00:04:54,402
<i>Tain't what you do</i>

67
00:04:54,444 --> 00:04:56,071
<i>It's the way
that you do it</i>

68
00:04:56,112 --> 00:04:57,409
<i>That's what
gets me through</i>

69
00:04:57,447 --> 00:04:59,108
<i>Ma ma ma my</i>

70
00:04:59,148 --> 00:05:00,843
<i>On the floor! Stop!</i>

71
00:05:01,984 --> 00:05:03,975
- Stop where you are now!
What the hell?

72
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,647
<i>Peter!</i>

73
00:05:05,688 --> 00:05:07,815
<i>Stop there!</i>

74
00:05:07,857 --> 00:05:09,415
- Are you all right?
- I'm OK.

75
00:05:09,459 --> 00:05:10,858
Gestapo. Watch out.

76
00:05:12,261 --> 00:05:14,627
Hold it!

77
00:05:20,269 --> 00:05:22,931
Don't let him get away!

78
00:05:34,851 --> 00:05:36,443
Get to the other side!

79
00:05:43,292 --> 00:05:44,759
Stop there!

80
00:05:49,699 --> 00:05:52,099
Aah!

81
00:05:58,341 --> 00:05:59,535
Peter, let's get out of here.

82
00:05:59,575 --> 00:06:01,167
Come on, come on.

83
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:04,741
Come on, let's go.

84
00:06:07,783 --> 00:06:09,045
<i>- Morning, Mama.
- Morning.</i>

85
00:06:09,085 --> 00:06:12,782
<i>- Morning, Mama Klara.
- Good morning, boys.</i>

86
00:06:12,822 --> 00:06:13,982
What happened to your face?

87
00:06:14,023 --> 00:06:16,014
I was trying a new dance step,
and I fell.

88
00:06:16,058 --> 00:06:17,355
Who were you fighting with?

89
00:06:17,393 --> 00:06:19,452
<i>Mama, I wasn't f/ghting.
I was dancing.</i>

90
00:06:19,495 --> 00:06:21,759
You told me you wouldn't become
part of something dangerous.

91
00:06:21,797 --> 00:06:25,255
I fell. It's a wild dance.
Here, let me show you.

92
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:27,360
No, no, no.
Not on me, you don't.

93
00:06:27,403 --> 00:06:31,703
Over the... boom. Into the back.
Ah. Ah. Mmm.

94
00:06:31,741 --> 00:06:33,140
Ow. Ow. Ow. Mmm.

95
00:06:33,175 --> 00:06:35,143
Looks to me like you have
to go to the bathroom.

96
00:06:35,177 --> 00:06:37,304
Mama Klara, no!

97
00:06:37,346 --> 00:06:40,509
Oh, that butter
has to last us a whole month.

98
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:42,882
It's not for you
to gorge yourself on.

99
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:44,546
Oh, I'm so glad
you're all amused.

100
00:06:44,587 --> 00:06:47,920
- I'm off.
- Peter.

101
00:06:47,957 --> 00:06:49,356
Mama.

102
00:06:51,761 --> 00:06:54,025
Peter...

103
00:06:54,063 --> 00:06:56,054
maybe Thomas's parents
are so well-placed...

104
00:06:56,098 --> 00:06:58,760
they don't care what kind
of trouble he gets into...

105
00:06:58,801 --> 00:07:00,530
but if you lose your place
in school...

106
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:02,470
you'll end up working
at the factory like me.

107
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:08,273
Mama, I'm going to university.
I'm going to be an engineer.

108
00:07:08,311 --> 00:07:11,109
There's a great need
for engineers now.

109
00:07:17,253 --> 00:07:19,483
<i>The Nazis
don't get everyone, Thomas.</i>

110
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,387
<i>I'm telling you,
he never had a chance.</i>

111
00:07:21,424 --> 00:07:23,187
<i>Here, let me give you
a bag. Let me help you.</i>

112
00:07:23,225 --> 00:07:24,988
<i>I got it. I'm f/ne.</i>

113
00:07:34,437 --> 00:07:36,962
<i>What did I tell you?</i>

114
00:07:37,006 --> 00:07:38,735
<i>At least he tried to escape.</i>

115
00:07:38,774 --> 00:07:41,072
<i>He didn't just wait for them.</i>

116
00:07:49,185 --> 00:07:51,619
<i>- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.</i>

117
00:07:53,456 --> 00:07:57,153
<i>Gestapo. Let's go. Come on.</i>

118
00:07:57,193 --> 00:07:58,785
Hey, they haven't caught us,
have they?

119
00:07:58,828 --> 00:08:00,090
Well, they will.

120
00:08:00,129 --> 00:08:02,825
We got out of the H.J., but
we won't get out of the army.

121
00:08:02,865 --> 00:08:04,594
Nobody gets out of it.

122
00:08:06,102 --> 00:08:08,161
Hey! Willi.

123
00:08:08,204 --> 00:08:10,138
<i>Peter, what's
your brother doing here?</i>

124
00:08:10,172 --> 00:08:12,504
<i>Come here.</i>

125
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:14,099
What are you following us for?

126
00:08:14,143 --> 00:08:17,135
I can be sleazy.
Just give me a chance.

127
00:08:17,179 --> 00:08:19,579
We don't need some pink-eared
midget hanging around.

128
00:08:19,615 --> 00:08:21,981
Go home to Mama.

129
00:08:22,018 --> 00:08:23,508
A couple of H.J.'s
are beating up a swing boy...

130
00:08:23,552 --> 00:08:24,951
in the alley around the corner.

131
00:08:27,723 --> 00:08:29,520
You better not be lying.

132
00:08:29,558 --> 00:08:33,050
In here. In here.

133
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:35,791
- They were beating him up.
How many were there?

134
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:43,162
Playing cowboys and indians?

135
00:08:43,205 --> 00:08:45,503
Can we play, too?

136
00:08:46,742 --> 00:08:48,039
What's the matter?
Four against five.

137
00:08:48,077 --> 00:08:49,408
That's still not a fair fight.

138
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:51,504
There's five.
Let me fight. I can fight.

139
00:08:51,547 --> 00:08:52,673
Willi, go home.

140
00:08:52,715 --> 00:08:56,242
What about one against one,
swing heine?

141
00:09:07,563 --> 00:09:08,962
Aah!

142
00:09:08,998 --> 00:09:10,659
What are you, a kike lover?

143
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,463
<i>Thomas.</i>

144
00:09:13,936 --> 00:09:15,494
<i>He's Jewish.</i>

145
00:09:20,776 --> 00:09:24,107
Thank you.

146
00:09:27,283 --> 00:09:30,184
You keep helping them,
and we'll deal with you...

147
00:09:30,219 --> 00:09:31,379
the way we deal
with all traitors.

148
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,320
I'm not a traitor!

149
00:09:33,355 --> 00:09:35,619
I'm a cowboy,
and you're a pansy!

150
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:38,252
Get out of here!

151
00:09:38,294 --> 00:09:40,489
I'm going to get you,
swing boy!

152
00:09:49,905 --> 00:09:52,271
Looked like a swing boy to me.

153
00:09:52,308 --> 00:09:54,401
How was I supposed to know?

154
00:09:54,443 --> 00:09:57,810
Come on, Willi.
We'll be late for school.

155
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,610
Swing boy.

156
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:04,176
<i>Hey, Peter! Thomas!
Quiz time.</i>

157
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,780
What is an icky?

158
00:10:06,822 --> 00:10:09,484
Someone who's stupid, not hip.
Can't collar that jive.

159
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:12,460
- Jive?
- Talk. What they say in Harlem.

160
00:10:12,495 --> 00:10:15,692
Too easy. Um, faust.

161
00:10:15,731 --> 00:10:17,062
<i>Oh, a book by Goethe.</i>

162
00:10:17,099 --> 00:10:20,159
- Icky.
- Even as we speak, two ickies.

163
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:24,036
- Icky, icky, icky, icky!
- A faust is an ugly girl.

164
00:10:24,073 --> 00:10:27,372
Like that faust you went for
at the Bismarck the other night.

165
00:10:27,409 --> 00:10:29,377
Boys, could you go for these?

166
00:10:29,411 --> 00:10:31,709
Ooh.

167
00:10:31,747 --> 00:10:34,147
<i>Ooh, I like these.
Look at those breasts.</i>

168
00:10:34,183 --> 00:10:35,844
- Otto, where did you get these?
- I got 'em.

169
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,147
What would you call that?
Cupcake size?

170
00:10:37,186 --> 00:10:38,380
<i>Cantaloupe.</i>

171
00:10:39,789 --> 00:10:42,917
Ooh, look what we have here.
Peter's priss.

172
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:45,256
<i>- Have you talked with her yet?
- Who said I'm interested?</i>

173
00:10:45,294 --> 00:10:48,092
<i>Your tongue was on the floor.
Didn't we see you pigeons...</i>

174
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:49,995
at the Cafe Bismarck
the other night?

175
00:10:50,032 --> 00:10:51,693
We wouldn't be
caught dead there.

176
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:54,134
Especially not with you,
Thomas Berger.

177
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:57,162
<i>Ooh!</i>

178
00:10:57,206 --> 00:11:00,642
- Well, you missed it.
- Why? What's so great about it?

179
00:11:00,676 --> 00:11:02,906
Well, it was
the swingingest party ever.

180
00:11:02,945 --> 00:11:05,743
- Right, Peter?
- Swingingest. Supermergentroid.

181
00:11:05,781 --> 00:11:07,112
Super what?

182
00:11:07,149 --> 00:11:09,413
Come on, Evey.
They talk gibberish.

183
00:11:09,451 --> 00:11:12,648
No. It's a secret language
we're not allowed to know.

184
00:11:12,688 --> 00:11:16,454
It's all too secret.
Ha ha!

185
00:11:16,492 --> 00:11:20,690
<i>You go to my head</i>

186
00:11:20,729 --> 00:11:25,257
<i>And you linger
like a haunting refrain</i>

187
00:11:25,301 --> 00:11:29,601
<i>And I f/nd you
spinning round in my brain</i>

188
00:11:29,638 --> 00:11:32,232
<i>Like the bubbles
in a glass of champagne</i>

189
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:33,536
<i>What did you do today?</i>

190
00:11:33,576 --> 00:11:35,476
<i>Did you and Thomas
go down to the docks?</i>

191
00:11:35,511 --> 00:11:37,001
<i>Yeah. We went
down there after school...</i>

192
00:11:37,046 --> 00:11:38,536
<i>but no new records came in.</i>

193
00:11:39,915 --> 00:11:41,507
So, what are we doing tomorrow?

194
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,812
Are we going to go
to the Hall Club?

195
00:11:42,852 --> 00:11:45,013
Willi.

196
00:11:45,054 --> 00:11:47,318
<i>I saw you looking at me.
You can't deny it.</i>

197
00:11:47,356 --> 00:11:48,880
<i>What are you doing?
Don't touch her!</i>

198
00:11:48,924 --> 00:11:51,518
- Mama!
- Goddamn you!

199
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,120
Leave him alone!

200
00:11:54,163 --> 00:11:56,631
<i>No, don't! Peter! No!</i>

201
00:11:56,665 --> 00:11:58,963
Peter, no! Don't! Don't!

202
00:11:59,001 --> 00:12:02,061
No! I'm all right.

203
00:12:02,104 --> 00:12:03,662
I'm all right.

204
00:12:07,243 --> 00:12:09,711
Herr Hinz was just leaving.

205
00:12:09,745 --> 00:12:11,542
I thought a woman
of your special background...

206
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,309
would value my protection.

207
00:12:15,885 --> 00:12:17,910
Your boy needs a haircut.

208
00:12:17,953 --> 00:12:21,389
- That's our business.
- Perhaps not.

209
00:12:21,423 --> 00:12:23,687
We have nothing to fear.

210
00:12:23,726 --> 00:12:25,921
For six years,
I've proven my loyalty.

211
00:12:25,961 --> 00:12:28,156
<i>The new order
demands absolute loyalty.</i>

212
00:12:28,197 --> 00:12:31,030
Youth of his sort
belong in a work camp.

213
00:12:31,066 --> 00:12:32,328
<i>Good night.</i>

214
00:12:34,236 --> 00:12:35,828
Herr Hinz, wait.

215
00:12:35,871 --> 00:12:38,101
Please, wait.

216
00:12:39,308 --> 00:12:42,072
- Who are you expecting?
- No one.

217
00:12:44,146 --> 00:12:46,614
Peter,
tell whoever it is to go away.

218
00:12:46,649 --> 00:12:48,708
- Mama.
- Do what I tell you.

219
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:59,586
<i>Good evening.
Is Frau Muller at home?</i>

220
00:12:59,628 --> 00:13:00,993
Who is it?

221
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:05,094
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler. Who are you?

222
00:13:05,134 --> 00:13:06,260
I am the block leader.

223
00:13:06,302 --> 00:13:08,566
I was collecting for the relief.
May I be of some service?

224
00:13:08,604 --> 00:13:10,469
No. You may go.

225
00:13:15,978 --> 00:13:17,775
May I help you?

226
00:13:17,813 --> 00:13:19,781
- Frau Muller?
- Yes.

227
00:13:19,815 --> 00:13:23,979
I'm so sorry to disturb you.
I'm Herr Knopp.

228
00:13:24,019 --> 00:13:25,213
Are you all right?

229
00:13:26,288 --> 00:13:27,915
Yes, it's nothing.

230
00:13:27,957 --> 00:13:30,721
- Are you going to take my mama?
- Willi, it's all right.

231
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:33,319
No one is going to take away
your mother, young man.

232
00:13:33,362 --> 00:13:38,800
Though with so beautiful a lady
it is quite tempting.

233
00:13:38,834 --> 00:13:42,497
But really,
you should see to that cut.

234
00:13:42,538 --> 00:13:45,598
You have some iodine?

235
00:13:45,641 --> 00:13:48,576
- Please allow me.
- It's not necessary.

236
00:13:50,179 --> 00:13:53,706
- He's in the Gestapo.
- Don't worry. It's all right.

237
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:55,808
We've done nothing wrong.
Just be quiet.

238
00:13:58,654 --> 00:13:59,814
I've found it.

239
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:02,687
Please sit down.

240
00:14:02,725 --> 00:14:06,422
Let me... let me see.

241
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:11,431
Now, this will only sting
for a moment.

242
00:14:13,335 --> 00:14:14,859
Ah, yes.

243
00:14:17,806 --> 00:14:21,298
There. There.

244
00:14:21,343 --> 00:14:23,106
That didn't hurt too much,
did it?

245
00:14:23,145 --> 00:14:25,670
- It should heal in no time.
- Thank you.

246
00:14:27,349 --> 00:14:30,614
<i>Uh, I can see you're wondering.</i>

247
00:14:30,652 --> 00:14:33,416
Regrettably, I am here
on official business...

248
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:38,188
but I hope that we can conclude
that as quickly as possible.

249
00:14:38,227 --> 00:14:40,354
Do you know a Karl Manglesdorf?

250
00:14:40,396 --> 00:14:45,663
<i>I did... a long time ago. He was
an associate of my husband's.</i>

251
00:14:45,701 --> 00:14:48,067
Mmm. Then you have not
seen him recently?

252
00:14:48,103 --> 00:14:52,836
No. The last time
was probably six years ago...

253
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:55,776
before my husband passed away.

254
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:57,574
Oh, I am so sorry.

255
00:14:57,613 --> 00:14:59,843
What has he done?

256
00:14:59,882 --> 00:15:01,645
Oh, it is unimportant.

257
00:15:01,683 --> 00:15:05,141
Uh, have any other
of your husband's associates...

258
00:15:05,187 --> 00:15:07,155
tried to contact you?

259
00:15:07,189 --> 00:15:09,487
<i>No.</i>

260
00:15:09,525 --> 00:15:11,186
<i>Since his death
I've had nothing to do...</i>

261
00:15:11,226 --> 00:15:12,716
<i>with any of his friends.</i>

262
00:15:12,761 --> 00:15:15,491
I took a job
at the Farben factory...

263
00:15:15,531 --> 00:15:18,659
and have devoted myself
to the reich and my children.

264
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,498
Well, you have raised
two fine sons.

265
00:15:21,537 --> 00:15:23,562
I see the resemblance.

266
00:15:23,605 --> 00:15:26,335
<i>Or is it just
a family proclivity...</i>

267
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:27,501
for facial abrasions?

268
00:15:27,543 --> 00:15:31,445
<i>Do you have news of my son?</i>

269
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:35,940
Excuse her. She's not feeling
well. Wilhelm is dead, Mama.

270
00:15:35,984 --> 00:15:38,544
Dear lady, it is I
who must excuse myself.

271
00:15:38,587 --> 00:15:41,283
I have all the information
I need.

272
00:15:41,323 --> 00:15:45,623
So, if anything else
occurs to you...

273
00:15:45,661 --> 00:15:49,791
or if I can help in any way,
any way at all...

274
00:15:49,832 --> 00:15:52,357
please.

275
00:15:54,169 --> 00:15:57,104
- Good night.
- Good night.

276
00:15:57,139 --> 00:15:59,972
- Here.
- Oh, thank you.

277
00:16:00,008 --> 00:16:01,669
Good night.

278
00:16:06,248 --> 00:16:08,944
<i>When I was a kid
about half past three</i>

279
00:16:08,984 --> 00:16:11,748
<i>My daddy said,
son, come here to me</i>

280
00:16:11,787 --> 00:16:15,052
<i>He says, things may come,
and things may go</i>

281
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:18,184
<i>But this is one thing
you ought to know</i>

282
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:19,660
<i>Tain't...</i>

283
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:23,224
Was Papa a Communist?

284
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:27,330
What?
Where did you get that idea?

285
00:16:27,369 --> 00:16:30,202
I don't know.

286
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,469
I mean, isn't that why
they arrested him?

287
00:16:32,508 --> 00:16:36,205
He wasn't a Communist.

288
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:38,509
Then what'd he do?

289
00:16:38,547 --> 00:16:40,572
Do you think I know everything?

290
00:16:40,616 --> 00:16:44,279
It was six years ago, Willi.
I don't remember.

291
00:16:44,319 --> 00:16:46,310
Well, you remember
more than I do.

292
00:16:46,355 --> 00:16:48,619
I was only three.

293
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:52,458
<i>I remember
they took him away...</i>

294
00:16:52,494 --> 00:16:55,691
and then he came back
after a long time...

295
00:16:55,731 --> 00:16:56,959
and he was sick.

296
00:16:56,999 --> 00:16:58,967
So?

297
00:17:03,672 --> 00:17:05,230
Did they make him sick
in prison?

298
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:07,640
<i>I don't know. Go to sleep.</i>

299
00:17:07,676 --> 00:17:09,940
<i>I have to work in the morning.</i>

300
00:17:17,486 --> 00:17:18,953
But he loved us...

301
00:17:18,987 --> 00:17:21,114
<i>didn't he?</i>

302
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,032
<i>- Ah, Peter.
- Herr Schumler.</i>

303
00:17:34,069 --> 00:17:36,162
<i>Make sure
you don't take any side trips.</i>

304
00:17:36,205 --> 00:17:39,538
I can't afford to keep
my older customers waiting.

305
00:17:39,575 --> 00:17:41,873
They're the only ones
who read anymore.

306
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:44,276
Everyone else is too busy
going to parades.

307
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:45,473
Yes, Herr Schumler.

308
00:17:46,682 --> 00:17:48,479
Don't you need the addresses?

309
00:17:50,586 --> 00:17:52,713
Distracted today.

310
00:17:54,756 --> 00:17:56,348
Nasty bruise.

311
00:17:56,391 --> 00:17:58,518
What happened?

312
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:03,054
Good morning. I'm looking
for a rare edition of Faust.

313
00:18:03,098 --> 00:18:06,966
Wait one second.
I think I have just the thing.

314
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:09,596
Peter, here it is.

315
00:18:31,126 --> 00:18:33,253
Just terrible.

316
00:18:37,399 --> 00:18:40,562
<i>"Traitor. "</i>

317
00:18:54,249 --> 00:18:57,685
I'm taking the radio.
I want that bureau as well.

318
00:18:57,719 --> 00:19:00,085
I'll be back for it.

319
00:19:00,122 --> 00:19:02,283
<i>This one?</i>

320
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:31,619
Delivery from Herr Schumler.

321
00:19:33,121 --> 00:19:36,090
- Frau Linge?
- Yes.

322
00:19:37,693 --> 00:19:40,389
The book for my mother.
She's bedridden.

323
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:43,125
How very kind of Herr Schumler
to send it. Thank you.

324
00:19:43,165 --> 00:19:47,431
That's Beethoven...
Piano Trio in B Flat Major.

325
00:19:47,469 --> 00:19:50,029
Are you a student
of classical music?

326
00:19:50,072 --> 00:19:51,232
No.

327
00:19:53,475 --> 00:19:56,376
My father...
I think he's the violinist.

328
00:19:56,411 --> 00:19:58,311
Wilhelm Muller?

329
00:19:58,347 --> 00:20:00,144
<i>Really?</i>

330
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:04,881
He was a great musician.
You must be very proud.

331
00:20:07,522 --> 00:20:10,958
Well... good-bye.

332
00:20:10,992 --> 00:20:13,153
Good-bye.

333
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:03,905
Ah, I found it.

334
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:09,412
- You can use the booth.
- What?

335
00:21:09,451 --> 00:21:12,386
I'm finished with the booth.

336
00:21:12,421 --> 00:21:13,581
You can use it.

337
00:21:17,092 --> 00:21:19,253
Can I help you find anything?

338
00:21:19,294 --> 00:21:21,762
I know this store like
it's my own private collection.

339
00:21:21,797 --> 00:21:24,493
No. Thanks.

340
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,160
OK.

341
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:32,200
- That's the best.
- Isn't Benny Goodman the best?

342
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,708
That is... this is Benny Goodman.

343
00:21:34,743 --> 00:21:37,576
- No, it's Gene...
- Oh, no, Gene Krupa is...

344
00:21:37,612 --> 00:21:39,603
Benny's illegal, so they
relabel all these jackets...

345
00:21:39,648 --> 00:21:40,774
to get them by the censor.

346
00:21:40,816 --> 00:21:43,216
The authorities don't know. It
takes them forever to catch on.

347
00:21:43,251 --> 00:21:45,811
You know, they haven't banned
Arshawsky yet...

348
00:21:45,854 --> 00:21:47,116
Artie Shaw... and he's Jewish.

349
00:21:47,155 --> 00:21:48,816
- Mm-hmm.
- And Count Basie.

350
00:21:48,857 --> 00:21:50,882
You can still get Count Basie.
He's a negro.

351
00:21:50,926 --> 00:21:52,086
Hmm.

352
00:21:52,127 --> 00:21:53,822
They probably think
he's the head of a country.

353
00:21:57,866 --> 00:21:59,925
You don't know anything
about swing, do you?

354
00:21:59,968 --> 00:22:01,868
Of course I do.

355
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:04,303
Just not a lot.

356
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:09,066
Come here.

357
00:22:10,278 --> 00:22:13,145
Get ready. You're about
to really blow your wig.

358
00:22:15,317 --> 00:22:17,842
Well, I should just...

359
00:22:17,886 --> 00:22:20,946
Let me... I'll close the...

360
00:22:20,989 --> 00:22:22,650
door.

361
00:22:33,835 --> 00:22:35,427
That's Bunny Berigan on trumpet.

362
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:39,973
Actually, it's Pee Wee Erwin.

363
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:43,877
Maybe it's Ziggy Elman.

364
00:22:43,912 --> 00:22:45,903
I thought you knew everything
about swing.

365
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:47,505
- Ah!
- Aah!

366
00:22:47,549 --> 00:22:50,211
<i>Ah, what a burn!</i>

367
00:22:50,252 --> 00:22:52,743
He's just got the greatest
solid send of jive.

368
00:22:52,787 --> 00:22:54,982
He just swings it out.
It's...

369
00:22:55,023 --> 00:22:57,514
- Supermergentroid.
- Yeah.

370
00:22:57,559 --> 00:22:59,686
- Do you jitterbug?
- No.

371
00:22:59,728 --> 00:23:01,286
Do you want to learn?
I just...

372
00:23:01,329 --> 00:23:02,523
It's easy,
and I could teach you.

373
00:23:02,564 --> 00:23:04,088
<i>Anyone can do it.</i>

374
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:05,724
<i>You can't listen to this
and not dance.</i>

375
00:23:08,436 --> 00:23:11,405
It just sends you. Yeah!

376
00:23:11,439 --> 00:23:13,304
Muller.

377
00:23:15,844 --> 00:23:17,573
Yeah! Yeah!

378
00:23:17,612 --> 00:23:19,341
Muller.

379
00:23:19,381 --> 00:23:22,009
Pow! Pow!

380
00:23:23,785 --> 00:23:24,979
Pow! Pow!

381
00:23:27,122 --> 00:23:28,646
<i>Muller!</i>

382
00:23:30,592 --> 00:23:32,492
This isn't
one of your dancing clubs.

383
00:23:32,527 --> 00:23:34,154
What?

384
00:23:34,195 --> 00:23:36,789
This isn't
one of your dancing clubs.

385
00:23:39,234 --> 00:23:41,862
We were... we were just listening.

386
00:23:41,903 --> 00:23:44,428
What about buying?

387
00:23:44,472 --> 00:23:47,873
I don't know why I bother
stocking those swing records.

388
00:23:47,909 --> 00:23:51,003
<i>They are more trouble
than they are worth.</i>

389
00:23:51,046 --> 00:23:52,809
I'll buy it.

390
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:54,072
<i>All right, you hep cats.</i>

391
00:23:54,115 --> 00:23:56,174
<i>Get ready to jump up and down.</i>

392
00:23:56,217 --> 00:23:59,050
Here's one of your own
who can really break it down.

393
00:23:59,087 --> 00:24:02,523
Herr Hitman meets Count Basie.
Yeah!

394
00:24:08,229 --> 00:24:10,254
Herr Django, man!

395
00:24:17,672 --> 00:24:23,643
<i>Shout and feel it</i>

396
00:24:41,997 --> 00:24:44,864
It's sounding hot tonight.

397
00:24:44,899 --> 00:24:46,560
Go ahead! Take it!

398
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:56,373
- Bop, bop!
- Hey!

399
00:24:59,047 --> 00:25:00,571
- Ha!
- Ha!

400
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:18,026
What?

401
00:25:21,403 --> 00:25:23,598
One, two...

402
00:25:23,638 --> 00:25:26,664
<i>The H.J. S are coming!
Hurry up!</i>

403
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,211
Oh, scheiss patrol.

404
00:25:49,164 --> 00:25:51,598
- Killer diller, man.
- You were great.

405
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:52,759
Thanks, Helga.

406
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:55,167
- Murderistic, Herr Hitman.
- Thanks.

407
00:25:57,572 --> 00:26:01,474
Look at those pansies.

408
00:26:01,509 --> 00:26:03,204
<i>They're all training
for the Gestapo.</i>

409
00:26:03,244 --> 00:26:04,734
<i>How did they know
we were here tonight?</i>

410
00:26:04,779 --> 00:26:07,213
<i>Probably beat it
out of some swing kid.</i>

411
00:26:07,248 --> 00:26:09,375
- That's Emil.
- Where?

412
00:26:11,553 --> 00:26:13,748
<i>So, it's true.</i>

413
00:26:13,788 --> 00:26:15,915
Goddamn traitor.

414
00:26:15,957 --> 00:26:19,484
He was probably forced into it.
It is compulsory, after all.

415
00:26:19,527 --> 00:26:20,892
<i>Oh, some excuse.</i>

416
00:26:20,929 --> 00:26:22,658
Those creeps are too busy
marching up and down all day...

417
00:26:22,697 --> 00:26:24,062
to keep track.

418
00:26:24,099 --> 00:26:26,659
Arvid's right.
Emil couldn't be a traitor.

419
00:26:26,701 --> 00:26:28,464
He was the original hep cat.

420
00:26:30,371 --> 00:26:34,364
No. No one who likes swing
can become a Nazi.

421
00:26:42,951 --> 00:26:46,580
<i>Aw, who needs him anyway?</i>

422
00:26:46,621 --> 00:26:49,317
<i>Come on, let's have some fun.</i>

423
00:27:16,284 --> 00:27:18,912
<i>- Keep that blindfold on.
- Blindfold's on.</i>

424
00:27:18,953 --> 00:27:20,978
<i>I'm sorry, Otto.</i>

425
00:27:21,022 --> 00:27:23,820
<i>I grooved this platter
from the f/rst lick.</i>

426
00:27:23,858 --> 00:27:26,224
<i>Harlem.
Recorded September 14, 1937.</i>

427
00:27:26,261 --> 00:27:29,094
<i>Teddy Foster, trumpet.
Freddy Gardner, alto...</i>

428
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:32,224
Hey! You guys are not going
to believe what just happened.

429
00:27:32,267 --> 00:27:34,599
This H.J. Rode by me
and whistled the signal.

430
00:27:34,636 --> 00:27:37,127
This H.J. Rode by me and
whistled It Don't Mean a Thing.

431
00:27:37,172 --> 00:27:39,697
- You're joking.
- He must've been a hep cat.

432
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:41,868
It's like Herr Hitman said.
A hep cat can't be broken.

433
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:44,140
No. What if he learned it
from Emil?

434
00:27:44,179 --> 00:27:46,170
<i>You know, he might have
been trying to trick you...</i>

435
00:27:46,214 --> 00:27:47,613
into telling him
where the next party is.

436
00:27:47,649 --> 00:27:52,018
Come on. It took you a year
to learn how to whistle that.

437
00:27:52,053 --> 00:27:53,611
Well, what's that
supposed to mean?

438
00:27:53,655 --> 00:27:55,179
It means what it means.

439
00:27:55,223 --> 00:27:57,714
Quiz time. "Joint is jumping. "

440
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:00,956
Um, what it isn't in here...
lively.

441
00:28:02,997 --> 00:28:06,228
Can't we find something
a little more exciting to do?

442
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:08,997
I say we go down
to the red light district.

443
00:28:09,037 --> 00:28:10,402
Make some new friends.

444
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:12,133
Yeah.
I could go for some ladies.

445
00:28:12,173 --> 00:28:13,299
Those kinds of friends
cost a lot of money.

446
00:28:13,341 --> 00:28:14,501
Actually,
I was thinking about...

447
00:28:14,542 --> 00:28:16,271
using some of that dough
you've got stashed away.

448
00:28:16,311 --> 00:28:19,007
Oh, no. I'm saving that money
for the shortwave radio.

449
00:28:19,047 --> 00:28:20,639
I'm not going to spend
that money on some tart.

450
00:28:20,682 --> 00:28:22,980
That's because even if you paid
her, you couldn't get one.

451
00:28:23,017 --> 00:28:24,541
Maybe the reason
you're so bored...

452
00:28:24,586 --> 00:28:26,451
is because you just
don't have any idea...

453
00:28:26,487 --> 00:28:27,954
which platters to pick.

454
00:28:27,989 --> 00:28:29,251
All right.
Put on that blindfold.

455
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:32,316
- What?
- Put it on.

456
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:36,820
I see. We go right into it.
Come on. Come on, Thomas.

457
00:28:36,865 --> 00:28:39,265
Pick any record in the room...
any record.

458
00:28:40,869 --> 00:28:43,030
OK.

459
00:28:43,071 --> 00:28:45,403
I believe I hear activity
over in the Gene Krupa section.

460
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,805
<i>I think that could be.</i>

461
00:28:50,011 --> 00:28:52,741
I'm waiting. I'm waiting.

462
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:55,510
No, no.

463
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:57,643
It's too easy.

464
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:11,828
- I'm sorry. My hand slipped.
- You did that on purpose.

465
00:29:11,866 --> 00:29:14,164
Don't be an ass. I'm sorry, OK?
I'll replace it.

466
00:29:14,202 --> 00:29:16,363
You will? From where?

467
00:29:16,404 --> 00:29:18,235
Alberti doesn't have
anything left.

468
00:29:18,273 --> 00:29:19,706
I got to go down to the docks.

469
00:29:19,741 --> 00:29:21,732
Besides, you have absolutely
no idea what to look for.

470
00:29:21,776 --> 00:29:24,540
<i>Oh, well, I'm sorry
I'm not as smart as you.</i>

471
00:29:24,579 --> 00:29:25,876
You know, the only reason
you know all these hits...

472
00:29:25,914 --> 00:29:27,211
is because
you can't dance to them.

473
00:29:27,248 --> 00:29:28,408
<i>Thomas.</i>

474
00:29:36,791 --> 00:29:39,988
Get out. Get out!

475
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,996
<i>Arvid, it was a mistake.
His hand slipped.</i>

476
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,260
Why do you always have to
go along with his stupid jokes?

477
00:29:44,299 --> 00:29:46,631
I'm not going along.
It was an accident, Arvid.

478
00:29:46,668 --> 00:29:48,533
- Get out of here... everybody.
- Why make so much of it?

479
00:29:48,569 --> 00:29:51,436
This is my hot club,
and I want you all to get out!

480
00:29:51,472 --> 00:29:53,599
Arvid.
- Go!

481
00:29:53,641 --> 00:29:54,938
<i>OK. To hell with you.</i>

482
00:29:54,976 --> 00:29:58,969
<i>Just sit around here all day
with your records whacking off.</i>

483
00:29:59,013 --> 00:30:02,141
OK? Come on, Peter.

484
00:30:06,154 --> 00:30:07,280
You shouldn't have said
that thing...

485
00:30:07,322 --> 00:30:10,450
about him not being able
to dance, Thomas.

486
00:30:10,491 --> 00:30:13,619
Why not? It's true.

487
00:30:13,661 --> 00:30:16,061
I'm sick of him
acting like he's smarter...

488
00:30:16,097 --> 00:30:19,225
than everybody else
all the time.

489
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:25,433
Look at that son of a bitch.

490
00:30:29,344 --> 00:30:32,780
<i>They all think they can get
away with whatever they want.</i>

491
00:30:32,814 --> 00:30:35,544
He stole that radio
from someone they arrested.

492
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:37,380
<i>I saw him give it to this tart.</i>

493
00:30:38,786 --> 00:30:40,151
What if we lifted it?

494
00:30:40,188 --> 00:30:43,419
<i>Next time he comes in
for his hot loaves...</i>

495
00:30:43,458 --> 00:30:45,653
he gets the cold shoulder
instead.

496
00:30:45,693 --> 00:30:47,752
Yeah.

497
00:30:47,795 --> 00:30:50,286
We could give it to Arvid.
Pick up Benny live.

498
00:30:50,331 --> 00:30:51,457
<i>Yeah.</i>

499
00:30:51,499 --> 00:30:53,262
Can you imagine the look
on that little creep's face...

500
00:30:53,301 --> 00:30:54,461
when we walk in with it?

501
00:30:58,206 --> 00:30:59,639
What do we do?

502
00:31:07,882 --> 00:31:09,179
<i>Aah!</i>

503
00:31:09,217 --> 00:31:11,014
Ohh!

504
00:31:11,052 --> 00:31:14,044
Fraulein. Fraulein.

505
00:31:14,088 --> 00:31:16,386
- Help me. Help me.
- Oh!

506
00:31:16,424 --> 00:31:19,791
I'm bleeding!
A gang of H.J. S stabbed me.

507
00:31:19,827 --> 00:31:23,024
Help me! I'm bleeding!
I'm bleeding!

508
00:31:23,064 --> 00:31:24,622
Get a doctor!
I don't want to die!

509
00:31:24,665 --> 00:31:27,964
- Oh, my God!
- Aah! Aah!

510
00:31:28,002 --> 00:31:29,902
Aah!

511
00:31:29,937 --> 00:31:31,302
<i>They hurt me so badly.</i>

512
00:31:31,339 --> 00:31:34,740
<i>No, no. Wait there.
Wait, please. Don't leave me!</i>

513
00:31:34,776 --> 00:31:36,744
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
No, no, no! No!

514
00:31:36,778 --> 00:31:38,370
<i>Let go!</i>

515
00:31:38,413 --> 00:31:44,045
Hey! What are you doing there?

516
00:31:46,354 --> 00:31:48,515
Help!

517
00:31:48,556 --> 00:31:51,650
<i>He stole my radio!</i>

518
00:31:53,127 --> 00:31:54,253
Aah!

519
00:31:54,295 --> 00:31:56,593
- Ha ha ha!
Help!

520
00:31:56,631 --> 00:31:57,893
Damn, pounders.

521
00:31:57,932 --> 00:31:59,695
You must stop them!

522
00:31:59,734 --> 00:32:01,895
<i>They stole my radio!</i>

523
00:32:03,604 --> 00:32:07,199
<i>Help!
- Hey, stop!</i>

524
00:32:07,241 --> 00:32:08,538
<i>Hey, hey, stop!</i>

525
00:32:11,979 --> 00:32:14,846
Hey! Stop!

526
00:32:17,218 --> 00:32:19,846
- Move!
- Go! Go! Move!

527
00:32:21,055 --> 00:32:22,522
Hey, you! Stop!

528
00:32:22,557 --> 00:32:23,819
Stop!

529
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:31,164
- Unh!
- Unh!

530
00:32:46,681 --> 00:32:48,615
Stop that truck!

531
00:32:48,649 --> 00:32:50,617
Come on, Peter!

532
00:32:50,651 --> 00:32:52,881
<i>Give me your hand!</i>

533
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,615
Come on! They're right
behind us! Come on!

534
00:32:54,655 --> 00:32:55,986
- Come on, Peter!
- I can't!

535
00:32:56,023 --> 00:32:57,991
Peter, drop the radio!

536
00:32:58,025 --> 00:33:00,289
Drop it! Drop the damn thing!

537
00:33:00,328 --> 00:33:03,297
- No! Come on!
- Leave it!

538
00:33:06,534 --> 00:33:08,001
Damn!

539
00:33:11,139 --> 00:33:13,232
<i>Peter!</i>

540
00:33:31,225 --> 00:33:33,750
Thomas.

541
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:05,520
<i>Where are you taking me?</i>

542
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,858
<i>Home.</i>

543
00:34:07,895 --> 00:34:09,556
Does my mother know?

544
00:34:09,597 --> 00:34:12,031
I think so.
She's the one who called me.

545
00:34:12,066 --> 00:34:13,431
Lucky for you she did...

546
00:34:13,467 --> 00:34:14,593
otherwise,
you could be on your way...

547
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:16,796
to a juvenile home
or worse by now.

548
00:34:16,837 --> 00:34:18,236
I don't care.

549
00:34:18,272 --> 00:34:22,072
However small your concern may
be for your own well-being...

550
00:34:22,109 --> 00:34:25,135
you might want to consider
that there are others...

551
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:28,205
who might be endangered
by your recklessness.

552
00:34:29,617 --> 00:34:31,642
What do I have to do?

553
00:34:31,686 --> 00:34:34,655
Only the same
as most boys your age are doing.

554
00:34:34,689 --> 00:34:36,850
I've informed the local H.J.
Commander of your situation.

555
00:34:36,891 --> 00:34:39,257
I'm not joining the H.J.

556
00:34:40,461 --> 00:34:42,759
Well, of course.
It's your decision.

557
00:34:42,797 --> 00:34:44,094
I'm just trying to help.

558
00:34:44,131 --> 00:34:46,156
I don't want your help.

559
00:34:48,302 --> 00:34:51,066
You know, Peter...

560
00:34:51,105 --> 00:34:53,573
you may not believe this...

561
00:34:53,608 --> 00:34:57,066
but I was once
very much like you.

562
00:34:57,111 --> 00:34:58,942
I know how confusing
things can seem...

563
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,379
when a young boy
loses his father.

564
00:35:01,649 --> 00:35:03,617
<i>Mine died
when I was only nine...</i>

565
00:35:03,651 --> 00:35:05,084
in the war.

566
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:06,381
I couldn't understand it.

567
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:09,446
I blamed everyone,
including myself.

568
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:13,085
I dropped out of school,
left home...

569
00:35:13,127 --> 00:35:16,654
drifted from one job
to the next.

570
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:19,029
Then one day...

571
00:35:19,066 --> 00:35:22,661
I heard a man speak in Munich.

572
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:25,263
I felt somehow
he was speaking directly to me.

573
00:35:25,306 --> 00:35:29,800
<i>Somehow, he understood
the helplessness I felt...</i>

574
00:35:29,844 --> 00:35:31,744
<i>the yearnings I had.</i>

575
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:36,777
That day,
I learned I was not alone.

576
00:35:36,817 --> 00:35:40,218
And while I'd been helpless
to save my father...

577
00:35:40,254 --> 00:35:41,778
there was still
much I could do...

578
00:35:41,822 --> 00:35:45,121
to help save something
far greater...

579
00:35:45,159 --> 00:35:46,649
the fatherland.

580
00:35:49,196 --> 00:35:52,063
You don't have to be alone,
Peter.

581
00:36:41,882 --> 00:36:43,543
Are you all right?

582
00:36:48,723 --> 00:36:50,953
I'm sorry, Mama.

583
00:37:01,836 --> 00:37:04,304
I'm supposed to join the H.J.

584
00:37:06,574 --> 00:37:08,041
Then you must.

585
00:37:09,944 --> 00:37:12,845
It was a mistake to allow you
not to join in the first place.

586
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,815
I just couldn't bear to see you
in that uniform.

587
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:18,410
But you have to think
of your future.

588
00:37:18,452 --> 00:37:20,010
They're pigs, Mama.

589
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,424
I've told you.

590
00:37:24,458 --> 00:37:26,722
You must learn
to steel yourself.

591
00:37:26,761 --> 00:37:28,888
You cannot let your feelings
overcome you.

592
00:37:28,929 --> 00:37:31,090
I won't join.

593
00:37:40,708 --> 00:37:43,199
Do you want them to start
watching the house again?

594
00:37:45,813 --> 00:37:47,280
Do you remember
what it was like...

595
00:37:47,314 --> 00:37:49,407
all of us jumping
at every knock?

596
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:54,815
I'd rather die
than go through that again.

597
00:38:38,699 --> 00:38:40,360
<i>He's always
giving instructions.</i>

598
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:42,528
<i>Hey, swing boy!</i>

599
00:38:43,537 --> 00:38:47,132
<i>Thomas? Ha ha ha!</i>

600
00:38:47,174 --> 00:38:48,539
What are you doing here?

601
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:51,511
Did you think I'd let you have
all this fun by yourself?

602
00:38:51,545 --> 00:38:53,979
This is not going to be fun.
You shouldn't have done this.

603
00:38:54,014 --> 00:38:56,505
Well, you'd have done
the same thing.

604
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:58,780
We can't let them
split us apart.

605
00:38:58,819 --> 00:39:01,083
Anyway, think about it.
It's the perfect cover...

606
00:39:01,121 --> 00:39:04,147
H.J. By day,
swing kids by night.

607
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:08,255
You look ridiculous.

608
00:39:10,231 --> 00:39:11,459
Come on.

609
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,259
<i>The German people
once again rest easy...</i>

610
00:39:15,302 --> 00:39:17,497
<i>that there is nothing to fear
from within.</i>

611
00:39:17,538 --> 00:39:19,733
<i>But let them not rest too easy.</i>

612
00:39:19,773 --> 00:39:22,367
<i>Like a plague,
the Jewish infestation...</i>

613
00:39:22,409 --> 00:39:24,070
<i>stays ready
to strike a death blow...</i>

614
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:26,841
<i>to the heart
of Germany's resurgence.</i>

615
00:39:26,881 --> 00:39:28,542
<i>The Jew cares nothing
for Germany.</i>

616
00:39:28,582 --> 00:39:30,482
<i>From early childhood,
its young are taught...</i>

617
00:39:30,518 --> 00:39:32,611
<i>to follow the lead
of the Jewish elders...</i>

618
00:39:32,653 --> 00:39:34,553
<i>whose stranglehold
on the world's economy...</i>

619
00:39:34,588 --> 00:39:37,580
<i>Germany has only now
started to break.</i>

620
00:39:39,927 --> 00:39:48,461
<i>Flat foot floogee
with the floy floy</i>

621
00:39:48,502 --> 00:39:50,993
<i>Floy doy, floy doy,
floy doy</i>

622
00:40:05,953 --> 00:40:07,545
Ha ha.

623
00:40:18,832 --> 00:40:21,801
Don't let us interrupt you,
swing boy. Keep dancing.

624
00:40:24,104 --> 00:40:26,504
Hey, what you got there?

625
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:28,269
Oh, Benny Goodman.

626
00:40:28,309 --> 00:40:30,140
Aah!

627
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:33,408
I was right about you. You're
just a bunch of Jew lovers.

628
00:40:33,447 --> 00:40:35,438
No!

629
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:43,050
You call us pansies.

630
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:45,684
Even my girlfriend doesn't
wear her hair that long.

631
00:41:00,908 --> 00:41:02,273
Aah!

632
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:09,811
Uhh!

633
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:12,444
A cripple, too.
Pick him up!

634
00:41:14,622 --> 00:41:16,214
Unh.

635
00:41:16,256 --> 00:41:18,588
What's your name?

636
00:41:18,626 --> 00:41:20,389
Django Reinhardt.

637
00:41:21,362 --> 00:41:22,590
Unh!

638
00:41:23,864 --> 00:41:25,422
Your name.

639
00:41:27,201 --> 00:41:28,566
Duke Ellington.

640
00:41:28,602 --> 00:41:30,126
I know his name.

641
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:32,565
Emil.

642
00:41:43,317 --> 00:41:45,410
Unh!

643
00:41:49,323 --> 00:41:52,924
Uhh!

644
00:41:54,061 --> 00:41:55,892
Uhh!

645
00:42:13,914 --> 00:42:15,142
Unh.

646
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:18,283
Unh.

647
00:42:19,219 --> 00:42:20,584
Aah!

648
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:24,614
Let's hear you play
that nigger kike music now.

649
00:42:24,658 --> 00:42:25,818
Aah!

650
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:36,770
- Oh, no!
- Arvid, it's all right.

651
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:38,772
- Hey.
- Arvid, it's Peter and Thomas.

652
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:41,297
Calm down.
- Arvid, it's OK!

653
00:42:41,341 --> 00:42:43,138
Calm down. It's OK.

654
00:42:43,177 --> 00:42:44,804
- It's OK.
- No!

655
00:42:44,845 --> 00:42:47,814
- Leave that alone.
- Leave me alone!

656
00:42:54,354 --> 00:42:57,255
He said I'd never play again.

657
00:42:59,259 --> 00:43:01,454
But he forgot about Django.

658
00:43:04,198 --> 00:43:07,065
<i>Django Reinhardt
played with two f/ngers.</i>

659
00:43:07,101 --> 00:43:08,534
<i>So can I.</i>

660
00:43:12,406 --> 00:43:14,203
<i>See?</i>

661
00:43:14,241 --> 00:43:16,334
They look just like his.

662
00:43:18,779 --> 00:43:20,838
He didn't need
these two fingers.

663
00:43:20,881 --> 00:43:23,008
Who did this to you?

664
00:43:23,050 --> 00:43:26,508
<i>Who said
you'd never play again?</i>

665
00:43:38,098 --> 00:43:40,623
Schaufuhrer Lutz
was the boxing champion...

666
00:43:40,667 --> 00:43:42,225
this year in your division...

667
00:43:42,269 --> 00:43:45,102
<i>and he will be instructing you
in the basic techniques.</i>

668
00:43:45,139 --> 00:43:47,369
I'll leave you to it.

669
00:43:47,407 --> 00:43:48,999
Yes, bannfuhrer.

670
00:43:54,782 --> 00:43:57,774
Will someone volunteer
to demonstrate...

671
00:43:57,818 --> 00:43:59,513
<i>or do I have to pick?</i>

672
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:01,646
I'll volunteer.

673
00:44:01,688 --> 00:44:03,815
Good.

674
00:44:03,857 --> 00:44:06,883
I'm glad to see
a new recruit so eager.

675
00:44:06,927 --> 00:44:08,121
<i>Heh heh.</i>

676
00:44:09,463 --> 00:44:12,398
<i>Let's see how you do when
you're not f/ghting a cripple.</i>

677
00:44:20,174 --> 00:44:21,607
<i>Keep your punches
close to your shoulder...</i>

678
00:44:21,642 --> 00:44:23,610
<i>otherwise, you leave yourself
unprotected.</i>

679
00:44:29,349 --> 00:44:32,045
Attacking your opponent's body
will bring his hands down...

680
00:44:32,085 --> 00:44:33,609
Uhh!

681
00:44:33,654 --> 00:44:35,485
Making his head more vulnerable.

682
00:44:38,025 --> 00:44:39,925
<i>Whoo! Good one, good one.</i>

683
00:44:43,297 --> 00:44:45,026
<i>Never be caught
against the ropes.</i>

684
00:44:45,065 --> 00:44:47,966
<i>Thank you, Herr Berger.
You've been most helpful.</i>

685
00:44:49,169 --> 00:44:50,761
Go to hell, traitor.

686
00:44:50,804 --> 00:44:54,968
I am not a traitor.
I just wised up.

687
00:44:55,008 --> 00:44:56,441
<i>You will, too.</i>

688
00:44:59,213 --> 00:45:02,205
<i>We'll need another volunteer
to help me demonstrate...</i>

689
00:45:02,249 --> 00:45:03,841
Schaufuhrer, watch out!

690
00:45:06,753 --> 00:45:08,846
<i>Go, Thomas, go!</i>

691
00:45:08,889 --> 00:45:10,083
<i>Go!</i>

692
00:45:13,093 --> 00:45:14,924
That's it!

693
00:45:16,496 --> 00:45:18,987
<i>Get off the ropes, Thomas.</i>

694
00:45:19,032 --> 00:45:22,126
Come on, Thomas!
Out of his way! Move! Come on!

695
00:45:26,373 --> 00:45:28,841
<i>Emil. Stop it!</i>

696
00:45:28,876 --> 00:45:31,538
- Enough?
- No!

697
00:45:31,578 --> 00:45:33,307
- Uhh!
- Stop!

698
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:36,312
Come on! Come on!

699
00:45:36,350 --> 00:45:37,647
<i>You proved your point, Thomas.</i>

700
00:45:37,684 --> 00:45:38,844
Enough?

701
00:45:40,687 --> 00:45:42,382
Uhh!

702
00:45:45,525 --> 00:45:46,992
<i>Just stay down.</i>

703
00:45:47,027 --> 00:45:48,756
<i>Emil!</i>

704
00:45:48,795 --> 00:45:50,524
<i>Emil, that's enough.</i>

705
00:45:53,567 --> 00:45:55,296
That's enough!

706
00:45:59,973 --> 00:46:02,142
You all right?

707
00:46:02,177 --> 00:46:05,009
Thomas...

708
00:46:05,045 --> 00:46:07,104
Lesson's over, swing heine.

709
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:15,181
Hey!

710
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:21,919
<i>It don't mean a thing</i>

711
00:46:21,962 --> 00:46:25,454
<i>If it ain't got that swing</i>

712
00:46:25,499 --> 00:46:28,525
<i>Doo wah, doo wah,
doo wah, doo wah, doo wah</i>

713
00:46:28,568 --> 00:46:32,527
<i>Doo wah, doo wah,
doo waaaah</i>

714
00:46:36,343 --> 00:46:38,140
<i>Yeah, swingin'</i>

715
00:46:38,178 --> 00:46:40,339
<i>Aw, yeah, man</i>

716
00:46:43,150 --> 00:46:45,209
<i>It don't mean a thing</i>

717
00:46:45,252 --> 00:46:47,618
<i>If it ain't got
the swing...</i>

718
00:46:47,654 --> 00:46:49,918
<i>Pow, pow, pow!
Three to the stomach.</i>

719
00:46:49,957 --> 00:46:51,720
Thomas won't go down.
The tables turn.

720
00:46:51,758 --> 00:46:54,056
Doof, doof, doof, doof, doof!

721
00:46:54,094 --> 00:46:56,324
Right to the fa...
you have to see Emil.

722
00:46:56,363 --> 00:46:59,491
- Emil's face is bent sideways.
- You look pretty bad yourself.

723
00:46:59,533 --> 00:47:00,659
Thanks.

724
00:47:00,701 --> 00:47:03,295
<i>It was murderistic.</i>

725
00:47:03,337 --> 00:47:05,134
I can't.
They smell your breath.

726
00:47:05,172 --> 00:47:08,471
Well, maybe we shouldn't
play this music.

727
00:47:08,508 --> 00:47:10,408
They might listen to your ears.

728
00:47:10,444 --> 00:47:12,412
So, what's it like anyway,
the H.J.?

729
00:47:12,446 --> 00:47:13,970
- Oh, it's...
- It's stupid as hell.

730
00:47:14,014 --> 00:47:15,641
All we do is memorize...

731
00:47:15,682 --> 00:47:18,742
the fuhrer's period of struggle
and all this other stuff.

732
00:47:18,785 --> 00:47:20,252
Almost as boring as it is here.

733
00:47:20,287 --> 00:47:21,845
<i>You don't have to be here.</i>

734
00:47:21,888 --> 00:47:24,755
Don't you have
some marching to do?

735
00:47:24,791 --> 00:47:26,258
We didn't want to join.
We had to.

736
00:47:26,293 --> 00:47:29,319
He had to. What's your excuse?

737
00:47:29,363 --> 00:47:30,694
Well, I'm his friend.

738
00:47:30,731 --> 00:47:34,098
So am I.
You don't see me joining.

739
00:47:34,134 --> 00:47:35,431
No. They wouldn't accept you.

740
00:47:39,873 --> 00:47:40,999
Come.

741
00:47:41,041 --> 00:47:43,202
<i>Arvid, you'll
never guess what I found.</i>

742
00:47:43,243 --> 00:47:44,870
I was over
at Silke's house, and...

743
00:47:44,911 --> 00:47:46,970
Oh. Hi.

744
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:52,517
- Hi, Helga. Come on in.
- Hi.

745
00:47:52,552 --> 00:47:54,144
What's the matter?

746
00:47:54,187 --> 00:47:56,178
<i>Everyone in here
looks sadder than a map.</i>

747
00:47:56,223 --> 00:47:57,622
When did she become a member?

748
00:47:57,657 --> 00:48:00,148
If we can let H.J. S in,
we can let her in.

749
00:48:00,193 --> 00:48:03,651
<i>What is that? I went after
Emil because of what he did...</i>

750
00:48:03,697 --> 00:48:05,324
and all the thanks I get
is a bunch of superior remarks?

751
00:48:05,365 --> 00:48:07,162
I never asked you to fight him.

752
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:10,465
<i>What's the matter with you?
Emil almost killed you.</i>

753
00:48:10,504 --> 00:48:14,031
So we're even.
Now we can all be friends.

754
00:48:14,074 --> 00:48:16,702
Oh, you're fitting right in...

755
00:48:16,743 --> 00:48:18,506
listening to the same songs...

756
00:48:18,545 --> 00:48:21,639
<i>wearing the same clothes,
getting into the same f/ghts.</i>

757
00:48:21,681 --> 00:48:23,273
It's almost like being
a swing kid, isn't it?

758
00:48:24,785 --> 00:48:26,776
Though if you never liked
the music to begin with...

759
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:27,980
I guess there's no difference.

760
00:48:30,090 --> 00:48:33,059
- All right, you bastard.
- You want to start something?

761
00:48:33,093 --> 00:48:35,994
You like that, don't you?
Take a swing at me!

762
00:48:36,029 --> 00:48:37,223
- Come on!
- Do it! Do it!

763
00:48:37,264 --> 00:48:39,664
Let go! Arvid. Leave it.

764
00:48:39,699 --> 00:48:40,859
<i>That's enough.</i>

765
00:48:47,474 --> 00:48:49,704
<i>Damn it, Arvid.</i>

766
00:48:52,946 --> 00:48:54,709
What's the matter with you?

767
00:48:54,748 --> 00:48:57,080
What do you want us to do?
He joined because of me.

768
00:48:57,117 --> 00:48:59,585
<i>Because of me.</i>

769
00:49:02,923 --> 00:49:04,914
If anyone's changed
around here, it's you.

770
00:49:04,958 --> 00:49:08,086
- No. I haven't changed.
- Yes, you have.

771
00:49:08,128 --> 00:49:10,858
You sit in here all day. You
never go out with us anymore.

772
00:49:15,869 --> 00:49:17,962
There's a party
at the Trichter tonight.

773
00:49:19,439 --> 00:49:20,872
Arvid?

774
00:49:22,275 --> 00:49:23,936
Well, we have to practice.

775
00:49:28,548 --> 00:49:30,072
<i>Hitler's a madman.</i>

776
00:49:30,117 --> 00:49:32,881
<i>He's trying to get us into
a war with the whole world.</i>

777
00:49:32,919 --> 00:49:34,648
The army
will put a stop to that.

778
00:49:34,688 --> 00:49:36,883
Oh, tch.
We must rely on the army.

779
00:49:36,923 --> 00:49:39,323
I wish you would stop
talking politics.

780
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:41,259
<i>What do doctors know
of such things?</i>

781
00:49:41,294 --> 00:49:43,023
<i>My father always said,
a man with a family...</i>

782
00:49:43,063 --> 00:49:44,826
<i>shouldn't even think
about politics.</i>

783
00:49:44,865 --> 00:49:47,060
When did your father
ever think about anything?

784
00:49:51,671 --> 00:49:53,468
Who's there?

785
00:49:54,641 --> 00:49:57,508
<i>Thomas, is that you?</i>

786
00:49:57,544 --> 00:49:59,512
- Thomas?
- Yes, Papa.

787
00:49:59,546 --> 00:50:02,242
Well, come in and say hello
to our guests.

788
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:12,217
Thomas,
what happened to your face?

789
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:14,727
Thomas, you remember
Dr. And Frau Keppler.

790
00:50:14,761 --> 00:50:16,422
- They're here from Berlin.
- Dietrich.

791
00:50:16,463 --> 00:50:18,260
Perhaps I had better get my bag.

792
00:50:18,298 --> 00:50:21,290
<i>Thomas,
you haven't said hello yet.</i>

793
00:50:22,836 --> 00:50:24,895
Hello,
Dr. Keppler, Frau Keppler.

794
00:50:24,938 --> 00:50:27,304
- Dietrich, for God's sake.
- I'm all right, Mama.

795
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:30,104
He's more than all right.
He's in his element.

796
00:50:30,143 --> 00:50:34,807
This is exactly
what I'm talking about.

797
00:50:34,848 --> 00:50:39,683
But they all look wonderful
in their uniforms, don't they?

798
00:50:39,719 --> 00:50:42,711
Our little Adolphi is no fool.

799
00:50:42,756 --> 00:50:45,316
Is that why you voted for him?

800
00:50:48,361 --> 00:50:53,025
You don't know
the first thing about it.

801
00:50:53,066 --> 00:50:56,263
Now go upstairs
and get cleaned up.

802
00:51:03,176 --> 00:51:05,610
<i>I suppose
if I think about my family...</i>

803
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:08,113
<i>I should hope that the Nazis
stay in power forever.</i>

804
00:51:08,148 --> 00:51:10,480
<i>With them in charge,
even a misf/t like Thomas...</i>

805
00:51:10,517 --> 00:51:13,611
<i>might have a chance
to make something of himself.</i>

806
00:51:35,108 --> 00:51:37,599
<i>- Hey!
- How you doing?</i>

807
00:51:37,644 --> 00:51:39,612
Peter, Thomas.

808
00:51:39,646 --> 00:51:41,113
- Good to see you again.
- Swing heil.

809
00:51:41,147 --> 00:51:42,808
Have fun. Swing heil.

810
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:47,149
Yeah!

811
00:51:55,795 --> 00:51:58,696
Sabina, let's jitterbug.
Up you go.

812
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:07,397
<i>Go, Thomas!
You're the king of Harlem!</i>

813
00:52:22,088 --> 00:52:24,886
Swing line!

814
00:52:24,924 --> 00:52:26,892
Come on, everybody!
Back up, back up!

815
00:52:26,926 --> 00:52:28,621
<i>Swing line!</i>

816
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:35,968
<i>Swing heil!</i>

817
00:52:36,002 --> 00:52:38,300
<i>Let's go, hepcats.</i>

818
00:52:38,338 --> 00:52:39,965
<i>Come on,
that's the way to swing!</i>

819
00:52:57,791 --> 00:52:59,281
Go!

820
00:52:59,326 --> 00:53:01,521
<i>Go! Go!</i>

821
00:53:20,046 --> 00:53:21,570
Come on!
