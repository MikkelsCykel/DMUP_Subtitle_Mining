Blue, 18.

00:00:45,912 --> 00:00:48,073
Set. Hit. Hit.

- Ready?
- Ready.

00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:06,796
<i>The Eagles will have to go for it</i>
<i>on fourth down</i>

7
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,869
with just 42 seconds left in the game
and no timeouts.

8
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:13,962
<i>Coach Taylor can get his first winning</i>
<i>season for the Shiloh Christian Academy</i>

9
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:16,042
<i>if they can pull this play off.</i>

10
00:01:16,142 --> 00:01:19,111
Move it, team! Set, hit!

11
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:25,173
<i>Zach Avery pitches back to Jacob Hall.</i>
<i>Jeremy Johnson's going down the field.</i>

12
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:27,378
<i>- Here come the Tigers.</i>
- Throw it, Jacob!

13
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:31,514
<i>Jacob's gonna try to tuck it and run,</i>
<i>and he's taken down at the 40-yard line,</i>

14
00:01:31,624 --> 00:01:33,319
<i>stopped by Lewis Slaughter.</i>

15
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:35,621
<i>Jeremy Johnson was wide open.</i>

16
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:40,529
<i>If he'd had a few seconds more, this</i>
<i>game might have had a different outcome.</i>

17
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:44,660
As it is, the Tigers will take over now
and will no doubt run out the clock,

18
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:49,037
<i>ending Coach Grant Taylor's bid for</i>
<i>his first winning season in six years.</i>

19
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:53,442
<i>Now he'll have to wait until next season</i>
<i>for that all-elusive winning record.</i>

20
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:57,106
<i>That's</i> if they let him
come back next year.

21
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,545
- Hi.
- Get 'em, Claire.

22
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:14,279
Hey, Grant. Come on, y'all.
Quit talking. <i>Let's</i> go, <i>let's</i> go. Hurry.

23
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:24,797
What?

24
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:34,465
What? You gotta be kidding me.

25
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:38,372
- This had better be a joke.
- No.

26
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:42,107
Mandy said he came in this morning,
got his papers.

27
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:46,311
A player <i>can't</i> just transfer to another
school. <i>He's</i> gotta change his address.

28
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:48,910
He did. <i>He's</i> moving in with his dad.

29
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:03,929
I <i>can't</i> believe that. This is
the third time this has happened.

30
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:06,335
Spend three years pouring into 'em

31
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:10,136
and when they get to their senior year,
they transfer to a rival school.

32
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:12,074
Why?

33
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:15,341
Well, 'cause at the end of the season,
nobody wants to be on TV

34
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:18,474
going, "We're number six, baby.
We're number <i>six."</i>

35
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:22,415
Well, you asked.

36
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,956
Just had to go there, <i>didn't</i> you?

37
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:34,130
- Did Darren switch to Tucker?
- We'll talk about it in a minute.

38
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:36,667
- So <i>it's</i> true?
- We'll talk about it in a minute.

39
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:38,634
Huddle up.

40
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:42,174
Coach, is it true
that Darren transferred to Tucker?

41
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:48,410
I got word this morning
that Darren did transfer to Tucker.

42
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:52,416
- There goes the season.
- The season will be whatever we make it.

43
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:55,351
<i>Who's</i> gonna take his place?
He scored a third of our points.

44
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:58,754
You let me worry about that.
We're not starting as if <i>it's</i> doomsday.

45
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:01,190
- <i>Nobody's</i> irreplaceable.
- Darren is.

46
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:04,354
Darren is not. <i>There's</i> more
to a good football team than a running back.

47
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:07,297
If anything, this ought to push you
to take up the slack.

48
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,096
Stop worrying about Darren.
Start your drills.

49
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:15,231
- We got a game to play this Friday night.
- <i>Let's</i> go, Shiloh. Come on. <i>Let's</i> go.

50
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:43,499
<i>Why'd</i> you park all the way out there?

51
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:45,696
Had to. It died again.

52
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:47,796
Why <i>don't</i> we get a new battery?

53
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:51,240
I'll get Brady to help me tomorrow.
I <i>don't</i> wanna think about it now.

54
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:54,472
- Do you want me to take a look at it for you?
- Stop it.

55
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,808
Oh, sweetheart...

56
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:02,547
I <i>don't</i> know what that smell is.
I've scrubbed everything I can.

57
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:05,954
- <i>It's</i> terrible.
- I know it is, but what else can I do?

58
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:08,026
I <i>don't</i> know where <i>it's</i> coming from.

59
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:10,254
This day stunk. Why <i>shouldn't</i> my house?

60
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:13,730
- What do you mean?
- Darren transferred to Tucker.

61
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,994
What? He did not.

62
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:19,538
Yep. Came by and got his papers,
<i>didn't</i> even say goodbye.

63
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,937
- Why?
- Why do you think?

64
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:24,509
<i>Didn't</i> see a chance of winning
at Shiloh.

65
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,875
But it <i>ain't</i> like <i>Tucker's</i>
gonna guarantee him a scholarship.

66
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:31,643
- I bet the boys are frustrated.
- More than you know.

67
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:51,367
I meant to throw that away.

68
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,065
Did you think you were pregnant?

69
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:59,133
I <i>don't</i> know. I just wanna be pregnant
so bad that my mind plays tricks on me.

70
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:13,848
You know, <i>it's</i> been four years
since we started trying.

71
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:18,188
Would you be opposed
to me going to see a specialist?

72
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:21,021
No.

73
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:23,761
<i>I'd</i> just like to know what she says.

74
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:27,906
OK.

75
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:31,942
I thought we were having
spaghetti tonight.

76
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:34,012
<i>Stove's</i> not working.

77
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:36,673
You are kidding me.

78
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:40,951
So we got a leak in the back room,
the dryer only works half the time,

79
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:44,784
the <i>car's</i> dying on us
and now the <i>stove's</i> broken.

80
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:46,859
<i>That's</i> about right.

81
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,052
No wonder <i>I'm</i> losing my hair.

82
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,457
I love you.

83
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:05,772
<i>And now your Georgia Sports Break</i>
<i>with Alicia Houston.</i>

84
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:09,871
The Richland Giants start football practice
as the new school year gets under way.

85
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:13,816
The team will be defending a three-year
GISA state championship run.

86
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,979
Now they prepare to fight for a fourth.

87
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:18,955
<i>I'm</i> here with head coach Bobby Lee Duke
of the Giants.

88
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,185
How does this year look for the team?

89
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:25,060
Alice, we've grown real fond
of the state title.

90
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:27,655
And we <i>don't</i> see any reason
to give it up this year.

91
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:31,567
I've got most of my starters coming back
and I've got a strong bench.

92
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:33,730
So I've only got one thing to say:

93
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:38,173
Get off the tracks,
<i>'cause the freight train's</i> coming.

94
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:08,467
I hope <i>that's</i> not a sign of the way
the rest of the <i>season's</i> gonna go, Coach.

95
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:11,297
- Why did he have to say that?
- Just let it go.

96
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:13,031
I hate this car.

97
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:15,767
<i>Let's</i> find somebody with jumper cables
and <i>let's</i> go home.

98
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:19,436
<i>It's</i> bad enough you lose your first game.
Now I <i>can't</i> even start my own car.

99
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:23,481
This happens to everybody.
<i>Don't</i> be embarrassed about it.

100
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:11,661
- Grant, I <i>wasn't</i> that embarrassed.
- Then why did you hide?

101
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:13,925
Why does this house
have to stink so bad?

102
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:17,628
You'll get used to it
after a couple of hours.

103
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:20,331
Honey, we gotta do something
about the car.

104
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:23,340
The only thing it does faithfully for us
is break down.

105
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:25,239
<i>That's</i> about right.

106
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:29,542
Would it not be better
just to get a small new car?

107
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:32,412
- You know we <i>can't</i> afford that.
- How do other people do it?

108
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:35,351
Other people make
more than 24,000 a year.

109
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:37,422
You make 6,000. That takes us to 30.

110
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:40,083
Enough to help us
with repairs occasionally,

111
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:42,524
not with a new car payment.

112
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:46,325
Besides, <i>there's</i> other bills
we <i>don't</i> normally have to pay.

113
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:49,765
- Like what?
- Like my doctor bill.

114
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:53,802
You saw her today?

115
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:57,642
- What did she say?
- She said that <i>I'm</i> fine.

116
00:12:57,743 --> 00:13:02,942
My numbers are normal and she saw
nothing that gave her concern.

117
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:06,575
- <i>That's</i> good.
- It <i>doesn't</i> mean the problem is with you.

118
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:11,349
- What else could it mean?
- We just may not have given it enough time.

119
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,482
Four years?

120
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:18,463
Are you still hoping we'll have a baby?

121
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:24,063
- You know I am.
- Me too.

122
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:28,072
I catch myself thinking about it
more and more.

123
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:32,975
<i>Don't</i> you wanna know
if <i>something's</i> preventing it?

124
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:38,540
Are you afraid of getting checked out?

125
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,846
Yes.

126
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:45,287
Grant, <i>I'm</i> still clinging to a hope

127
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:47,916
that one day we'll have children.

128
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:55,232
I imagine 'em running in this house.

129
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:58,201
I hear 'em playing in the backyard

130
00:13:58,304 --> 00:14:02,866
or running to our bed in a thunderstorm.

131
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:08,040
And I think about reading 'em stories

132
00:14:09,715 --> 00:14:12,149
and teaching 'em songs.

133
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:17,619
And I just keep thinking

134
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:26,461
how can I miss someone so much
that I have never met?

135
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:33,569
I'll go.

136
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,341
Stanley.

137
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:46,251
Stanley.

138
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:51,020
Stanley, do you wanna tell me
what you're doing on the top of my desk?

139
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,285
No.

140
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:57,158
Do you have any idea
how you got on top of my desk?

141
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:58,230
No.

142
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:00,890
I suggest you get down immediately.

143
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:13,170
You two can tell Coach Taylor
that you're late for practice today

144
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,474
because you've been
sitting in detention.

145
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,606
Come on. That was some serious humor.

146
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:21,948
I'll get serious about your humor
when you get serious about your studies.

147
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:26,682
55?

148
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:32,560
Well, if you wanna announce your grade
to the entire class, you go right ahead.

149
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:34,724
57.

150
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,671
So basically we got
the toughest schedule we ever had

151
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:43,105
and less talent than we ever had.

152
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:47,406
At least we got Dewey County on Friday
night. That'll be a pretty easy win.

153
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:52,507
- <i>I'm</i> concerned it might be our only win.
- We'll pull three or four out.

154
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:55,553
That'll give us another average season.

155
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:57,815
<i>I'm</i> so sick of average seasons.

156
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,756
- I gotta go.
- Where are you going?

157
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,522
- Got a <i>doctor's</i> appointment.
- For what?

158
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,825
- I have a <i>doctor's</i> appointment.
- For what?

159
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:11,164
Leave the man alone.
He <i>don't</i> have to tell you.

160
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,500
So <i>what's</i> wrong with you, man?

161
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:16,073
I'll be back in a couple of hours.

162
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:21,279
Now look what you did.
You done made him mad.

163
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,712
Me? You're the one that made him mad.

164
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:27,411
No, not me.
Besides, I know where <i>he's</i> going.

165
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,955
- Where?
- <i>He's</i> going to the hair doctor.

166
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:35,550
The man is going bald. You <i>hadn't</i>
noticed that underdeveloped region?

167
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,288
You're one to talk, Slick.

168
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:41,196
See, when a black man goes bald,
he still looks good.

169
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:46,169
Look at Michael Jordan,
George Foreman, Samuel L. Jackson.

170
00:16:46,271 --> 00:16:49,832
Classy-looking brothers.
Who you got? Kojak?

171
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:53,640
Yeah, Coach gonna get him some plugs.

172
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:58,539
- Grant would not get plugs.
- <i>Don't</i> laugh. You next.

173
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:24,474
Your soccer skills
get better every year, son.

174
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:28,103
It <i>doesn't</i> matter. Shiloh <i>doesn't</i> have
a soccer team. They play football.

175
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:30,875
So? Why not kick for the football team?

176
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:33,008
They've already got a good kicker.

177
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:35,279
<i>I'm</i> sure they <i>wouldn't</i> mind
having two.

178
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:39,084
Dad, <i>I'm</i> too small. I really
just <i>don't</i> feel like getting killed.

179
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:42,217
Are you saying you're not interested

180
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:45,057
or <i>you'd</i> like to try out
but you're afraid?

181
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:47,098
What if I <i>don't</i> even make the team?

182
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:50,032
Well, you're already not on the team.

183
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:53,332
You <i>can't</i> get any more not on the team
than you are right now.

184
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:57,170
- OK, Dad.
- David, you <i>can't</i> be afraid of failure.

185
00:17:57,276 --> 00:18:00,143
Everyone fails at some point.

186
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:03,476
So you think I should try out
for the football team?

187
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:08,076
Well, if you're waiting around
for soccer, it <i>ain't</i> gonna happen.

188
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:21,632
- Coach Owens, have you got a minute?
- Yeah.

189
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:25,692
Look, some of the men have been talking.

190
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:29,001
We wanna see this school succeed
with our football program.

191
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,133
I know you feel the same way, too.

192
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:37,045
But, frankly, we <i>don't</i> ever see that
happening while Coach Taylor is here.

193
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:39,481
You know we're in a rebuilding season.

194
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:44,522
Look, I know <i>he's</i> a fine man and all,
but <i>he's</i> had six years here

195
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:47,649
and nothing significant
to even show for it.

196
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:50,785
I honestly believe
you would make a better head coach.

197
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:02,568
Some of us have requested
a meeting with Mr. Ryker.

198
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:08,112
If you would just support us, I really
believe this could go a lot easier.

199
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:10,238
Mr. Pervis, I <i>don't</i> know.

200
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:12,909
Look, <i>it's</i> not like
we're trying to hurt the guy.

201
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:16,385
What we're doing
is for the benefit of the school.

202
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:19,946
You just think about it.

203
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:24,929
Good hustle, Casey.

204
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:30,865
- What was that about?
- What?

205
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:35,297
- Alvin Pervis.
- We were just talking.

206
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,810
Everything all right?

207
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:41,209
- Yeah.
- Mr. Taylor.

208
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:43,674
Yes.

209
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:48,585
<i>I'm</i> Larry Childers.
This is my son David. <i>He's</i> a junior.

210
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:51,679
- We're new to the school.
- Good to meet you. What can I do for you?

211
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:56,227
I just wanted to introduce myself to you
and David wanted to try out for the team.

212
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:59,320
- You a football player?
- I've always played soccer.

213
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:02,923
- I figured I could try out as a kicker.
- I've got a pretty good kicker,

214
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:07,028
but I <i>don't</i> mind letting you try out.
Jonathan, come here.

215
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:10,666
This is Jonathan. He holds
for our main kicker, Joshua Webster.

216
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:14,712
Jonathan, this is David Childers.
He wants to try out as a kicker.

217
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:18,806
- Why <i>don't</i> you two go and try a few kicks?
- All right, sure.

218
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:22,409
Thank you, sir. I'll just hang around
till practice is over.

219
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:25,217
No problem. Good to meet you.

220
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,287
Y'all just move here?

221
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:31,419
Yeah, from Athens. My dad got a job
teaching at the college.

222
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:32,895
<i>That's</i> cool.

223
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:37,332
<i>I'm</i> used to kicking soccer balls,
but I thought I could at least try out.

224
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:40,462
Josh is a pretty good kicker,
but <i>he's</i> also a receiver.

225
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:44,030
I think he likes that
better than kicking. Here you go.

226
00:20:56,154 --> 00:20:58,122
<i>I'm</i> sorry.

227
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:01,622
<i>I'm</i> sorry.

228
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,563
<i>I'm</i> sorry.

229
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:11,603
- Sorry about that.
- <i>It's</i> all right.

230
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:20,607
- Hey, watch it.
- Sorry.

231
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:34,218
Matt.

232
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,828
Matt.

233
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:41,894
- <i>Let's</i> go.
- <i>I'm</i> going with Brock for a while.

234
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,161
- Not tonight. You're coming home.
- Why?

235
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:48,069
- <i>Don't</i> argue with me. <i>Let's</i> go.
- No, Dad. I'll be home later.

236
00:21:48,173 --> 00:21:49,435
Matt.

237
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:11,520
That old man still come every week
to pray in the hallway?

238
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:15,464
Mr. Bridges. Prays for the students
as he passes their locker.

239
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:21,438
- How long has he been doing that?
- Praying for revival since before I got here.

240
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:26,170
Lord knows we need it. Apathy in the
<i>school's</i> as bad as our football record.

241
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:30,339
That reminds me. I think you should go ahead
and let David Childers on the team.

242
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:36,311
- You see something there?
- <i>He's</i> just used to playing soccer.

243
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:39,219
He <i>ain't</i> that strong,
but he shows promise.

244
00:22:41,126 --> 00:22:43,560
All right. I'll give him a shot.

245
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:58,276
One, two, hit!

246
00:23:07,285 --> 00:23:10,618
What are you doing?
<i>Let's</i> stay in the game!

247
00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:18,993
No! No!

248
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:27,497
Will someone tell me
how we lost to Dewey County 21 to 7?

249
00:23:28,306 --> 00:23:30,433
21 to 7!

250
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:34,808
Dewey County <i>hasn't</i> beaten Shiloh
since you were in kindergarten!

251
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:39,907
I <i>don't</i> know what you call that junk
out there, but it sure <i>wasn't</i> football.

252
00:23:40,018 --> 00:23:42,987
Nine dropped passes,
four fumbles, three interceptions.

253
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:45,420
Their defense
scored most of their points!

254
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:48,357
You gave the game away!

255
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:52,453
You <i>can't</i> win football games
if you <i>don't</i> play together as a team.

256
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:56,625
You <i>can't</i> win when you're more concerned
about what you're doing afterwards!

257
00:23:56,735 --> 00:24:02,196
And you <i>can't</i> learn the plays when you miss
practice 'cause you're <i>sittin'</i> in detention.

258
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:05,805
<i>I'm</i> sick of the apathy on this team.

259
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:10,075
If we're not here to win football games,
then why are we here?

260
00:24:15,987 --> 00:24:18,148
So, do you agree with him?

261
00:24:18,256 --> 00:24:21,692
I <i>don't</i> know. I guess.

262
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:25,320
Only a few guys on the team
really seem to care.

263
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:27,694
So are you ready to play in the game?

264
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:31,235
I <i>don't</i> know why they would use me
when they've got Joshua Webster.

265
00:24:31,336 --> 00:24:33,998
He can kick a 45-yard field goal.

266
00:24:34,105 --> 00:24:35,732
I bet you could too.

267
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:39,470
Dad, I can barely kick
a 35-yard field goal.

268
00:24:39,578 --> 00:24:42,741
At the end of the game,
kind of glad I <i>didn't</i> play.

269
00:24:42,848 --> 00:24:45,646
That way, I <i>can't</i> mess up.

270
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:49,652
- <i>That's</i> fear, son.
- I just <i>don't</i> wanna embarrass the team.

271
00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:54,818
David, I've asked God
since you were a baby

272
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:58,327
that he would show how strong he is
in your life

273
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:02,161
and that through you
people would see how good he is.

274
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:06,796
Then why would he make me
so small and weak?

275
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:08,998
To show how mighty he is.

276
00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:15,177
Why <i>don't</i> we get washed up for dinner?
We can finish this later.

277
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,248
All right.

278
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:12,394
Dad.

279
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,500
OK. <i>I'm</i> OK.

280
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:20,169
- What were you doing?
- You missed a spot up there.

281
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:22,644
Thought I could get it for you.

282
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:25,375
I guess I got a little too ambitious.

283
00:26:25,483 --> 00:26:28,452
I was just trying to take a swing at it.

284
00:26:40,832 --> 00:26:43,392
So, what does that mean?

285
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:47,562
Is there a procedure?
What are my options?

286
00:26:48,673 --> 00:26:52,700
Grant, first you need you realize
this is a fairly common problem for men.

287
00:26:52,811 --> 00:26:57,544
Thousands of couples are unable
to have children. You do have options.

288
00:26:57,649 --> 00:27:00,675
Although <i>there's</i> only
a 10% chance of success,

289
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:03,845
many couples have tried
in vitro fertilization.

290
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:08,892
- We <i>can't</i> afford that.
- The other option is to adopt a child.

291
00:27:08,994 --> 00:27:11,656
But <i>it's</i> about as expensive either way.

292
00:27:11,763 --> 00:27:16,427
If you're interested, I'll put you
in touch with the local agency.

293
00:27:16,534 --> 00:27:19,970
I realize this is difficult
for you to hear,

294
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:22,562
but you and your wife can
make the best decision

295
00:27:22,674 --> 00:27:25,268
now that you know where you are.

296
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:42,019
Sorry. I <i>didn't</i> realize
anybody was still here.

297
00:27:42,127 --> 00:27:45,460
- Hey, Steve.
- Putting in late hours tonight?

298
00:27:45,563 --> 00:27:48,999
Yeah, I guess so.
I can lock up. You can take off.

299
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,068
All right. Thanks, Coach.

300
00:28:26,137 --> 00:28:28,935
<i>It's</i> about the boys.

301
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,133
<i>I'm</i> not asking you to throw him out.

302
00:28:31,242 --> 00:28:35,645
If Shiloh can invest in a winning coach,
we <i>don't</i> need to settle for second best.

303
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:38,215
You can let him go
with as much class as you want to.

304
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:41,752
- Alvin, <i>he's</i> a good man.
- <i>I'm</i> not saying <i>he's</i> not a good man.

305
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:44,117
<i>I'm</i> saying <i>he's</i> not a good coach.

306
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:48,215
Come on, Dan. Just look at the facts.
His record speaks for itself.

307
00:28:48,326 --> 00:28:52,228
- We need new leadership.
- I still think he deserves more time.

308
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:57,097
<i>He's</i> had six years. If he was capable
of winning, <i>he'd</i> have done it by now.

309
00:28:57,202 --> 00:28:59,727
Grant Taylor is not capable of winning.

310
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:02,898
He <i>doesn't</i> have it in him.
<i>That's</i> the whole point.

311
00:29:03,007 --> 00:29:07,239
<i>I'm</i> just saying I want my son to have
the best football program possible.

312
00:29:07,345 --> 00:29:09,939
My <i>son's</i> got a chance
for a football scholarship

313
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:12,312
if <i>he's</i> taught by the right coach.

314
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,385
<i>Matt's</i> gonna be a senior next year.

315
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:17,455
I <i>don't</i> wanna see him
lose this opportunity.

316
00:29:17,555 --> 00:29:22,083
Brady, you're awfully quiet.
<i>What's</i> your take on this?

317
00:29:22,193 --> 00:29:24,661
Honestly, I <i>don't</i> know.

318
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:29,132
Sometimes I think Grant could do a better job
of building this football program.

319
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:33,933
But then other times I think <i>he's</i> doing
just as good as anyone else would.

320
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:36,563
You could do better.

321
00:29:36,674 --> 00:29:38,869
- What we need is a change.
- Now.

322
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:42,208
We're losing booster support,
game attendance is down,

323
00:29:42,313 --> 00:29:45,874
and from the looks of it
we've already lost this season.

324
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:49,818
Dan, we've got a weak program
because we've got a weak coach.

325
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:53,152
<i>He's</i> dead weight.
We need to cut him loose.

326
00:30:05,036 --> 00:30:08,437
Have you been at school all this time?

327
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,201
Yes.

328
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:14,267
I tried to call you an hour ago.
Is everything all right?

329
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:23,552
Grant, talk to me.

330
00:30:28,126 --> 00:30:30,594
I <i>don't</i> know where to start.

331
00:30:32,397 --> 00:30:34,365
<i>What's</i> going on?

332
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:41,430
I was trying to lock up for Steve

333
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:44,133
and I overheard Dan
meeting with some fathers.

334
00:30:46,611 --> 00:30:49,079
They <i>didn't</i> know I was there.

335
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:56,046
Brooke, they're pushing him
to get rid of me.

336
00:30:56,154 --> 00:31:01,057
Neil Prater, Alvin Pervis, Luke Rae.

337
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:08,988
They said I <i>wasn't</i> capable of winning,
called me dead weight.

338
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:12,331
They <i>can't</i> make Dan fire you.
You've still got support.

339
00:31:12,437 --> 00:31:16,874
You just go get JT and Brady
and see him tomorrow.

340
00:31:16,975 --> 00:31:19,136
Brady was there.

341
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:28,218
They've just lost confidence in me.

342
00:31:31,022 --> 00:31:36,892
I was so sure I could turn this program
around and I've just sunk it lower.

343
00:31:39,964 --> 00:31:44,298
Brooke, I've tried so hard.
Why <i>can't</i> I win?

344
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:48,498
You can win.
Stop beating yourself up, Grant.

345
00:31:48,606 --> 00:31:52,042
Brooke, I <i>can't</i> provide you
with a decent home.

346
00:31:52,143 --> 00:31:55,704
I <i>can't</i> provide you with a decent car.

347
00:31:55,813 --> 00:31:58,782
<i>I'm</i> a failing coach
with a losing record.

348
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:04,517
And I <i>can't</i> give you
the children you want.

349
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:07,958
What?

350
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:12,229
<i>It's</i> me.

351
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:15,065
Like everything else is me.

352
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:21,466
We <i>can't</i> have our own children
because of me.

353
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:27,637
<i>What's</i> God doing?
I mean, why is it so hard?

354
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:32,808
<i>It's</i> OK, Grant.

355
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:35,948
<i>It's</i> OK.

356
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:12,372
<i>"I love you, O Lord, my strength."</i>

357
00:34:12,483 --> 00:34:16,783
<i>"The Lord is my rock and my fortress,
my deliverer,

358
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:19,379
my God in whom I trust,

359
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:24,621
my shield and the horn of my salvation,
my <i>stronghold."</i>

360
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:28,290
<i>"I will call upon the Lord
who is worthy to be <i>praised."</i>

361
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:31,368
<i>"So shall I be saved from my enemies."</i>

362
00:34:33,671 --> 00:34:36,037
Lord Jesus, would you help me?

363
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:38,108
I need you.

364
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:42,841
Lord, I feel like
<i>there's</i> giants of fear and failure

365
00:34:42,947 --> 00:34:45,916
just staring down at me
waiting to crush me.

366
00:34:46,017 --> 00:34:48,747
And I <i>don't</i> know how to beat 'em, Lord.

367
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:51,321
<i>I'm</i> tired of being afraid.

368
00:34:53,324 --> 00:34:57,727
Lord, if you want me
to do something else, show me.

369
00:34:57,829 --> 00:35:02,562
If you <i>don't</i> want me to have children,
so be it.

370
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:05,295
But you're my guide.

371
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:07,701
You're on the throne.

372
00:35:09,073 --> 00:35:12,042
You can have
my hopes and my dreams.

373
00:35:14,078 --> 00:35:18,037
Lord, give me something.
Show me something.

374
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:50,103
If the Lord never gives us children,
will you still love him?

375
00:36:10,768 --> 00:36:12,258
Field-goal unit.

376
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:16,932
Hold on, Joshua. I wanna give David
a shot at this one. David, come here.

377
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:19,942
This is your field goal.
Put us on the board.

378
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:39,025
Hit.

379
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:48,539
<i>It's</i> all right, man. <i>It's</i> hard.
You'll get it next time.

380
00:37:00,785 --> 00:37:04,016
Dad, I <i>don't</i> even know
why they let me on the team.

381
00:37:04,121 --> 00:37:05,588
Did you do your best, son?

382
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:08,022
I knew I was gonna miss it
before I kicked it.

383
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:11,959
Your actions will always
follow your beliefs, David.

384
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:14,463
Dad, I <i>can't</i> even kick it straight.

385
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:19,264
And I <i>can't</i> walk. Should I just
stay home and pout about it?

386
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:23,500
If you accept defeat, David,
then <i>that's</i> what you'll get.

387
00:37:28,713 --> 00:37:31,978
Well, Brady, another fine example

388
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:35,348
of Grant <i>Taylor's</i>
wonderful coaching abilities.

389
00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:38,684
Look, the kids <i>don't</i> deserve it.
The fans <i>don't</i> deserve it.

390
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:41,053
When you gonna get
a bellyful of this guy?

391
00:37:41,158 --> 00:37:43,683
<i>What's</i> it gonna take?
You got a chance, man.

392
00:37:43,794 --> 00:37:46,888
You got a chance to step in
and take over this program

393
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:49,193
and carry it up for a while.

394
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,598
When are you gonna get
sick and tired of it?

395
00:37:51,702 --> 00:37:55,103
You got an opportunity here.
This <i>program's</i> going in the tank.

396
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:57,174
<i>Ryker's</i> gotta...

397
00:38:12,223 --> 00:38:14,691
Grant, he came to me.

398
00:38:17,828 --> 00:38:20,456
You're not doing anybody any favors
sitting on the fence.

399
00:38:20,564 --> 00:38:23,795
You determine which side
you wanna be on and stay on it.

400
00:38:41,952 --> 00:38:43,920
Mr. Bridges.

401
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:47,521
Revelation Chapter 3 says:

402
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:51,117
<i>"We serve a God
that opens doors that no one can shut,

403
00:38:51,228 --> 00:38:54,425
and he shuts doors
that no one can <i>open."</i>

404
00:38:54,532 --> 00:39:00,402
<i>"He says: 'Behold, I have placed before
you an open door that no one can shut.

405
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:02,734
<i>'I know you have a little strength,

406
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:07,038
yet you have kept my word
and have not denied my <i>name."'</i>

407
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:12,306
Coach Taylor,
the Lord is not through with you yet.

408
00:39:12,416 --> 00:39:14,884
You still have an open door here,

409
00:39:14,985 --> 00:39:19,649
and until the Lord moves you, you're
to bloom right where you're planted.

410
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:24,359
I just felt led
to come and tell you that today.

411
00:39:37,441 --> 00:39:39,409
Mr. Bridges.

412
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:44,912
Do you believe
God told you to come tell me that?

413
00:39:45,015 --> 00:39:46,983
I do.

414
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:52,147
I admit to you I have been struggling.

415
00:39:52,256 --> 00:39:55,089
But I've also been praying.

416
00:39:55,192 --> 00:39:58,992
I just <i>don't</i> see him at work here.

417
00:39:59,096 --> 00:40:04,625
Grant, I heard a story about two farmers
who desperately needed rain.

418
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:06,965
And both of them prayed for rain,

419
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:11,440
but only one of them went out
and prepared his fields to receive it.

420
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:15,911
Which one do you think trusted God
to send the rain?

421
00:40:16,013 --> 00:40:19,505
The one who prepared his fields for it.

422
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:21,744
Which one are you?

423
00:40:21,852 --> 00:40:24,343
God will send the rain when <i>he's</i> ready.

424
00:40:24,455 --> 00:40:27,891
You need to prepare your field
to receive it.

425
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:17,673
So this is your new team philosophy?

426
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:19,743
What do you think?

427
00:41:19,844 --> 00:41:23,371
I think this applies to all of life,
not just football.

428
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,949
Well, <i>that's</i> my point.

429
00:41:27,518 --> 00:41:31,352
10 bucks to the person who can tell me who
won the state championship a decade ago.

430
00:41:31,455 --> 00:41:33,286
- Walker Jennings.
- No.

431
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:35,551
- North Metro.
- Stop guessing.

432
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:38,184
You know it or you don't.

433
00:41:38,295 --> 00:41:41,093
- How about five years ago?
- Richland?

434
00:41:41,198 --> 00:41:43,860
That was three years ago.

435
00:41:43,968 --> 00:41:47,028
You <i>can't</i> remember, can you?

436
00:41:47,137 --> 00:41:49,196
Leads me to ask a couple of questions.

437
00:41:50,474 --> 00:41:53,966
- <i>What's</i> the purpose of this team?
- Win ball games.

438
00:41:54,078 --> 00:41:57,514
- Then what?
- We get a trophy. And people talk about us.

439
00:41:57,615 --> 00:41:59,913
Maybe, for a while.

440
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:02,315
- Then what?
- I <i>don't</i> know.

441
00:42:02,419 --> 00:42:07,447
Get a scholarship, play for college
and coach Little League.

442
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:12,492
What are you getting at?
You think we're just wasting our time?

443
00:42:12,596 --> 00:42:14,757
If our main goal is to win games,
then yes.

444
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:18,460
- You <i>don't</i> want us to win games?
- No.

445
00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:21,333
Not if <i>that's</i> our main goal.

446
00:42:21,438 --> 00:42:24,771
Winning football games
is too small a thing to live for.

447
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:27,435
And I love football as much as anybody.

448
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:31,743
But even championship trophies will
one day collect dust and be forgotten.

449
00:42:33,684 --> 00:42:36,744
<i>It's</i> just that so far
all this has been about us,

450
00:42:36,854 --> 00:42:40,654
how we can look good,
how we can get the glory.

451
00:42:42,626 --> 00:42:47,893
The more I read this book,
the more I realize <i>life's</i> not about us.

452
00:42:48,799 --> 00:42:51,791
We're not here just to get glory,
make money and die.

453
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:54,928
The Bible says
that God put us here for him,

454
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:57,530
to honor him.

455
00:42:57,641 --> 00:43:00,269
Jesus said the most important thing
you could do with your life

456
00:43:00,377 --> 00:43:04,143
is to love God with everything you are
and love others as yourself.

457
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:08,708
So if we win every game
and we miss that, we've done nothing.

458
00:43:08,819 --> 00:43:11,253
Football then means nothing.

459
00:43:12,156 --> 00:43:15,592
So <i>I'm</i> here to present you
a new team philosophy.

460
00:43:15,693 --> 00:43:19,322
I think that football is just
one of the tools we use to honor God.

461
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,864
So you think God
does care about football?

462
00:43:21,966 --> 00:43:24,594
I think he cares about your faith.

463
00:43:24,702 --> 00:43:26,863
He cares about where your heart is.

464
00:43:26,971 --> 00:43:28,939
If you can live your faith on the football field,

465
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:32,270
then, yes, God cares
<i>'cause he cares about you.

466
00:43:32,376 --> 00:43:35,539
He sent his son Jesus to die for us
so we could live for him.

467
00:43:35,646 --> 00:43:37,477
<i>That's</i> why we're here.

468
00:43:38,515 --> 00:43:41,348
But, see,
<i>it's</i> not just on the football field.

469
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:44,080
We've gotta honor him
in our relationships,

470
00:43:44,188 --> 00:43:49,285
in our respect for authority,
in the classroom,

471
00:43:49,393 --> 00:43:53,352
and when you're at home alone
surfing the internet.

472
00:43:57,167 --> 00:44:01,297
I want God to bless this team so much,
people talk about what he did.

473
00:44:01,405 --> 00:44:03,703
But it means we gotta give him our best
in every area.

474
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:07,868
And if we win, we praise him.
And if we lose, we praise him.

475
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:13,211
Either way, we honor him
with our actions and our attitudes.

476
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:16,775
So <i>I'm</i> asking you,
what are you living for?

477
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:22,349
I've resolved to give God
everything I've got,

478
00:44:22,459 --> 00:44:25,428
then I'll leave the results up to him.

479
00:44:26,797 --> 00:44:29,197
I wanna know if you'll join me.

480
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:33,394
Your <i>attitude's</i> like the aroma
of your heart.

481
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:37,634
If your attitude stinks,
it means your <i>heart's</i> not right.

482
00:44:37,741 --> 00:44:39,936
He sure is preachy today.

483
00:44:43,981 --> 00:44:45,744
What?

484
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:49,410
- <i>How's</i> your attitude, Brock?
- <i>It's</i> fine.

485
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,751
Then you'll be OK
with the death crawl, right?

486
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:55,791
All right, everybody on the goal line.
Get your partner. <i>Let's</i> go.

487
00:44:55,893 --> 00:44:59,385
All right, <i>let's</i> go. Show me something.
10 yards. Move it. <i>Let's</i> go.

488
00:44:59,496 --> 00:45:03,728
Matt, <i>let's</i> go. <i>Let's</i> go, Jonathan.
Show me something. 10 yards.

489
00:45:03,834 --> 00:45:07,270
Show me some power. No knees.
Keep your knees off the ground.

490
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:10,772
Show me something. Here we go.
10 yards. Show me some muscle.

491
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:14,207
Show me some power.
Give me some heart. <i>Let's</i> go.

492
00:45:14,311 --> 00:45:18,213
Very good, boys. Very good.
<i>Let's</i> run it back.

493
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:26,788
- Man, <i>that's</i> not even funny, dude.
- Yeah, it is.

494
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:29,620
So, Coach,
how strong is Westview this year?

495
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:32,355
A lot stronger than we are.

496
00:45:32,463 --> 00:45:35,660
You already written Friday night down
as a loss, Brock?

497
00:45:35,766 --> 00:45:37,927
Well, not if I knew we could beat 'em.

498
00:45:40,871 --> 00:45:43,840
Come here, Brock. You too, Jeremy.

499
00:45:45,008 --> 00:45:47,340
- What? Am I in trouble now?
- Not yet.

500
00:45:47,444 --> 00:45:52,575
I wanna see you do the death crawl again
except I wanna see your absolute best.

501
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:55,711
What? You want me to go the 30?

502
00:45:55,819 --> 00:45:59,084
- I think you can go the 50.
- The 50?

503
00:45:59,189 --> 00:46:01,157
I can go the 50 if <i>nobody's</i> on my back.

504
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:05,922
You can do it with Jeremy on your back,
but promise you're gonna do your best.

505
00:46:06,029 --> 00:46:08,998
- All right.
- Your best.

506
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:11,897
- OK.
- You're gonna give me your best?

507
00:46:12,002 --> 00:46:15,233
- <i>I'm</i> gonna give you my best.
- All right, one more thing.

508
00:46:15,339 --> 00:46:17,603
- I want you to do it blindfolded.
- Why?

509
00:46:17,708 --> 00:46:21,735
I <i>don't</i> want you giving up at a certain
point when you can go further. Get down.

510
00:46:21,845 --> 00:46:24,370
Jeremy, get on his back.

511
00:46:26,216 --> 00:46:28,309
Now, get a good tight hold, Jeremy.

512
00:46:28,418 --> 00:46:31,046
All right. <i>Let's</i> go, Brock.

513
00:46:31,155 --> 00:46:34,147
Keep your knees off the ground.
Just your hands and feet.

514
00:46:34,258 --> 00:46:37,125
A little bit left. A little bit left.

515
00:46:37,227 --> 00:46:39,695
There you go. Show me good effort.

516
00:46:41,598 --> 00:46:44,066
Thataway, Brock. You keep coming.

517
00:46:45,936 --> 00:46:48,461
- There you go.
- Come on, Brock.

518
00:46:48,572 --> 00:46:51,769
- Come on.
- <i>It's</i> a good start. Little bit left.

519
00:46:51,875 --> 00:46:54,708
Little bit left. There you go, Brock.

520
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:58,281
Good strength.

521
00:47:00,384 --> 00:47:03,581
You gotta be kidding me.

522
00:47:03,687 --> 00:47:07,453
- <i>That's</i> it, Brock. <i>That's</i> it.
- Am I at the 20 yet?

523
00:47:07,558 --> 00:47:11,255
Forget the 20. You give me your best.
You keep going. <i>That's</i> it.

524
00:47:11,361 --> 00:47:13,454
<i>Don't</i> stop.
You got more in you than that.

525
00:47:13,564 --> 00:47:15,532
I <i>ain't</i> done. <i>I'm</i> resting a second.

526
00:47:15,632 --> 00:47:19,193
You gotta keep moving. <i>Let's</i> go.
<i>Don't</i> quit till you got nothing left.

527
00:47:19,303 --> 00:47:22,830
There you go. Keep moving. Keep moving.

528
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:25,431
Keep moving.
<i>That's</i> it. You keep driving.

529
00:47:25,542 --> 00:47:29,569
Keep your knees off the ground.
Keep driving it. Your very best.

530
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:34,310
Your very best. Keep moving, Brock.
<i>That's</i> it. <i>That's</i> it. <i>That's</i> it.

531
00:47:34,418 --> 00:47:37,478
Keep going.
<i>Don't</i> quit on me. Keep going.

532
00:47:37,588 --> 00:47:40,955
Keep driving it. Keep your knees
off the ground. <i>That's</i> it.

533
00:47:41,058 --> 00:47:44,050
Your very best.
<i>Don't</i> quit on me. Your very best.

534
00:47:44,161 --> 00:47:47,528
Keep driving. Keep driving.
There you go. There you go.

535
00:47:47,631 --> 00:47:50,930
<i>That's</i> it. You keep driving.
Keep your knees off the ground.

536
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:53,696
<i>Don't</i> quit till you got nothing left.

537
00:47:53,804 --> 00:47:56,864
Keep moving, Brock.
<i>That's</i> it. <i>That's</i> it. <i>That's</i> it.

538
00:47:56,974 --> 00:48:00,637
Keep going. I want everything you got.
Come on, keep going.

539
00:48:01,812 --> 00:48:04,440
- It hurts.
- <i>Don't</i> quit on me. Your very best.

540
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:08,985
Keep driving. Keep driving.
There you go. There you go.

541
00:48:09,086 --> 00:48:10,576
- <i>He's</i> heavy.
- I know.

542
00:48:10,687 --> 00:48:13,383
- <i>I'm</i> about out of strength.
- Then find more strength.

543
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:16,516
<i>Don't</i> you give up on me, Brock.
You keep going, you hear me?

544
00:48:16,627 --> 00:48:20,495
You're doing good. You keep going.
Do not quit on me. You keep going.

545
00:48:20,597 --> 00:48:23,794
- It hurts.
- I know it hurts. You keep going.

546
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:28,338
<i>It's</i> all heart from here. 30 more steps.
You keep going, Brock. Come on.

547
00:48:28,438 --> 00:48:29,962
- Keep going.
- It burns.

548
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:31,904
- Let it burn.
- My arms are burning.

549
00:48:32,009 --> 00:48:34,500
<i>It's</i> all heart.
You keep going, Brock. Come on.

550
00:48:34,611 --> 00:48:38,980
Come on. Keep going.
You promised me your best. Your best.

551
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:41,175
- <i>Don't</i> stop. Keep going.
- <i>It's</i> too hard.

552
00:48:41,285 --> 00:48:44,118
<i>It's</i> not too hard.
You keep going. Come on, Brock.

553
00:48:44,221 --> 00:48:47,156
Give me more. Give me more. Keep going.

554
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:49,452
20 more steps. 20 more.

555
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:53,120
Keep going, Brock.
Give me your best. <i>Don't</i> quit.

556
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:55,960
No. Keep going. Keep going.

557
00:48:56,066 --> 00:48:59,558
Keep going. <i>Don't</i> quit. <i>Don't</i> quit.

558
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:02,662
<i>Don't</i> quit.
Brock Kelley, you <i>don't</i> quit.

559
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:04,741
Keep going. Keep going.

560
00:49:04,841 --> 00:49:09,175
Go, Brock Kelley. You <i>don't</i> quit on me.
No, you keep going.

561
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:11,577
You keep going. Go, Brock.

562
00:49:11,682 --> 00:49:13,650
10 more steps. 10 more.

563
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:15,741
10 more. 10 more.

564
00:49:15,852 --> 00:49:18,753
Keep going. <i>Don't</i> quit.
Give me your heart.

565
00:49:18,855 --> 00:49:21,688
- I <i>can't</i> do it.
- You can. You can.

566
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:23,760
Five more. Five more.

567
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:27,853
Come on, Brock. Come on.
<i>Don't</i> quit. <i>Don't</i> quit.

568
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:31,799
Come on. Two more. One more.

569
00:49:35,672 --> 00:49:40,609
<i>That's</i> gotta be 50. <i>That's</i> gotta be 50.
I <i>don't</i> have any more.

570
00:49:45,082 --> 00:49:48,313
Look up, Brock. You're in the end zone.

571
00:49:54,858 --> 00:49:57,918
Brock, you are the most
influential player on this team.

572
00:49:58,028 --> 00:50:01,361
If you walk around defeated, so will they.

573
00:50:01,465 --> 00:50:04,923
Tell me you <i>can't</i> give me more
than what I've been seeing.

574
00:50:05,035 --> 00:50:10,530
You just carried a 140-pound man
across this whole field on your arms.

575
00:50:12,442 --> 00:50:15,138
Brock, I need you.

576
00:50:15,245 --> 00:50:18,908
<i>God's</i> gifted you with the ability
of leadership. <i>Don't</i> waste it.

577
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:22,975
- Coach.
- Can I count on you?

578
00:50:25,822 --> 00:50:27,790
Yes.

579
00:50:29,059 --> 00:50:31,152
Coach.

580
00:50:31,261 --> 00:50:34,958
- What is it, Jeremy?
- I weigh 160.

581
00:50:54,584 --> 00:50:57,849
All right. <i>Who's</i> next?

582
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:06,161
Good practice, boys.
See you all tomorrow.

583
00:51:06,263 --> 00:51:09,960
Hey, man, for the first time in a while,
I actually feel good about Friday night.

584
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:13,662
- Yeah? Why?
- <i>I'm</i> just on board with what you're doing.

585
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:16,705
If they get ahold of it,
it'll change their lives.

586
00:51:16,807 --> 00:51:18,775
You count me in.

587
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:25,276
Grant, me too.

588
00:51:25,382 --> 00:51:28,112
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

589
00:51:28,218 --> 00:51:30,686
I feel like I owe you an apology.

590
00:51:30,787 --> 00:51:33,585
I just want you to know
that <i>I'm</i> with you.

591
00:51:35,158 --> 00:51:37,718
- Thank you.
- See you tomorrow.

592
00:51:54,644 --> 00:51:57,807
- You need a ride, Matt?
- No, my <i>dad's</i> coming.

593
00:51:57,914 --> 00:52:00,576
Or at least, <i>he'd</i> better be.

594
00:52:01,585 --> 00:52:03,815
Can I shoot straight with you
for a minute?

595
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:07,117
- Sure.
- I feel like you owe your dad more respect.

596
00:52:07,224 --> 00:52:09,556
- Why?
- 'Cause <i>he's</i> your father.

597
00:52:09,659 --> 00:52:12,253
- You <i>don't</i> know him like I know him.
- I <i>don't</i> have to.

598
00:52:12,362 --> 00:52:14,887
You need to respect him
because <i>it's</i> the right thing.

599
00:52:14,998 --> 00:52:17,967
You know, Coach,
my dad <i>doesn't</i> even like you.

600
00:52:18,068 --> 00:52:21,162
He thinks the school
needs to find somebody else.

601
00:52:21,271 --> 00:52:24,570
<i>That's</i> beside the point.
Scripture says to honor your parents.

602
00:52:24,674 --> 00:52:27,700
- And all you do is complain.
- All he does is boss me around.

603
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:30,041
He <i>doesn't</i> even try to understand me.

604
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:34,413
You <i>can't</i> judge your father by his
actions and yourself by your intentions.

605
00:52:34,518 --> 00:52:37,214
It <i>doesn't</i> work that way.
You're not responsible for him.

606
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:41,416
You're responsible for you. You honor
God by honoring your authority.

607
00:52:41,525 --> 00:52:46,053
You really believe in all that honoring
God and follow Jesus stuff?

608
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:48,529
Yes, I do.

609
00:52:48,632 --> 00:52:51,726
Well, I <i>ain't</i> trying to be disrespectful,

610
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:53,803
but not everybody believes in that.

611
00:52:53,904 --> 00:52:58,705
Religion works for some people, but <i>I'm</i>
just here 'cause I got kicked out of Westview.

612
00:52:58,808 --> 00:53:01,038
Matt, <i>nobody's</i> forcing anything on you.

613
00:53:01,144 --> 00:53:04,705
Following Jesus Christ is a decision
you're gonna have to make for yourself.

614
00:53:04,814 --> 00:53:06,782
You may not wanna accept him.

615
00:53:06,883 --> 00:53:10,580
<i>'Cause he'll change your life.
You'll never be the same.

616
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:14,817
I do hope one day
you realize how much he loves you.

617
00:53:14,925 --> 00:53:17,223
I'll see you tomorrow.

618
00:53:27,103 --> 00:53:30,732
I'll get him. Give me the bag.
Bring that trash bag here. Set it down.

619
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:34,867
- <i>Don't</i> you let that touch me.
- <i>I'm</i> gonna get him out of here.

620
00:53:34,978 --> 00:53:38,607
- Oh, man, he stinks.
- I <i>can't</i> believe that was in my house.

621
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:43,652
- Just make sure <i>it's</i> still dead.
- <i>It's</i> probably been dead for weeks.

622
00:53:43,753 --> 00:53:46,244
You just get it out of here. Out. Out.

623
00:53:46,356 --> 00:53:48,984
- Stop being a... Come here. Look at it.
- No.

624
00:53:49,092 --> 00:53:52,391
It looks like a big hamster.
Come here, come here.

625
00:53:52,495 --> 00:53:56,454
<i>Don't</i> be afraid. Just face your fear.
<i>He's</i> got a cute little tail there.

626
00:53:56,566 --> 00:54:01,401
<i>He's</i> just got a big stink.
Look. See his cute little eyes there?

627
00:54:01,504 --> 00:54:05,133
See his teeth? Look at his teeth.
Almost looks like <i>he's</i> mad.

628
00:54:06,343 --> 00:54:10,336
You're terrible! I <i>can't</i> believe
you did that to me, Grant Taylor.

629
00:54:10,447 --> 00:54:12,415
You are so bad.

630
00:54:15,986 --> 00:54:18,546
David, right down the middle.
You got this.

631
00:54:20,991 --> 00:54:23,050
Right, set it up. Run it again.

632
00:54:23,159 --> 00:54:26,617
- Sorry, Coach.
- David, listen, son.

633
00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:29,858
You act like you're gonna miss
before you even kick the ball.

634
00:54:29,966 --> 00:54:32,730
We're gonna have to change
your kicking philosophy.

635
00:54:32,836 --> 00:54:36,431
Now, see, you're kicking wide left
or wide right.

636
00:54:36,539 --> 00:54:38,507
That <i>ain't what's</i> gonna get you home.

637
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:41,338
The ball has got to go
through the middle.

638
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:43,878
- I know, Coach.
- No, you don't.

639
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:46,039
Now, what does Scripture say about this?

640
00:54:47,817 --> 00:54:50,047
Scripture says, "Wide is the gate

641
00:54:50,153 --> 00:54:52,621
and broad is the way
that leads to destruction,

642
00:54:52,722 --> 00:54:54,747
and many there be that find <i>it."</i>

643
00:54:54,858 --> 00:54:59,795
Now, to us, <i>that's</i> wide left
and wide right.

644
00:54:59,896 --> 00:55:03,559
<i>"But narrow is the gate and straight
is the way that leads to life,

645
00:55:03,667 --> 00:55:06,534
and few there be that find <i>it."</i>

646
00:55:06,636 --> 00:55:09,901
Anybody can kick it
wide left or wide right.

647
00:55:10,006 --> 00:55:13,601
My mama can kick it
wide left and wide right.

648
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:16,577
- But that <i>ain't what's</i> gonna get you home.
- Come on.

649
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:20,013
It <i>don't</i> have to look pretty.
It <i>don't</i> have to look smooth.

650
00:55:20,116 --> 00:55:22,141
It can look like a dying duck.

651
00:55:22,252 --> 00:55:24,447
But the ball has to go
through the middle.

652
00:55:24,554 --> 00:55:26,545
Oh, my word.

653
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:29,784
Now, David, you gonna have to choose
the narrow way.

654
00:55:29,893 --> 00:55:32,657
<i>That's</i> the only path
where you will get your reward.

655
00:55:32,762 --> 00:55:36,721
Now send this ball through these pearly
posts. Set it up for me, Jonathan.

656
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:41,861
I've never heard it that way before, but
<i>there's</i> a lot of truth to what <i>he's</i> saying.

657
00:55:41,971 --> 00:55:44,269
<i>Let's</i> see you kick it.

658
00:55:53,216 --> 00:55:55,684
Yeah, <i>that's</i> what <i>I'm</i> talking about.

659
00:56:00,757 --> 00:56:04,352
Grant, are you not aware
of <i>what's</i> going on outside on the field?

660
00:56:04,461 --> 00:56:07,157
- What?
- You might wanna come check this out.

661
00:56:10,133 --> 00:56:13,330
Mitch decided to bring
his Bible class outside today.

662
00:56:13,436 --> 00:56:16,735
Matt Prater stood up
and accepted Christ as his Lord.

663
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:20,037
It was awesome. He started
confessing stuff from his life,

664
00:56:20,143 --> 00:56:22,475
asking his friends for forgiveness.

665
00:56:22,579 --> 00:56:25,810
Next thing we know, Bob Duke stands up
and does the same thing.

666
00:56:25,915 --> 00:56:29,112
Kids break up into groups,
they begin to pray for each other,

667
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:31,744
they ask forgiveness for sins
they've committed.

668
00:56:31,855 --> 00:56:36,792
This has been going on for three hours.
How did you not know what was going on?

669
00:57:08,191 --> 00:57:12,127
Bless them in a special way.
Lord, I ask you to lift them up to you.

670
00:57:16,332 --> 00:57:20,291
I ask you to bring up a generation
that has a heart for you, Lord.

671
00:57:23,606 --> 00:57:25,574
Coach.

672
00:57:30,146 --> 00:57:33,707
- <i>I'm</i> proud of you, Matt.
- I need to talk with my dad.

673
00:57:33,817 --> 00:57:36,115
<i>I'd</i> like to go see him.

674
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:39,752
I'll take you right now.

675
00:57:41,424 --> 00:57:44,188
So what we've done here
is we've gained these four lots

676
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:46,421
by moving the retention pond down here.

677
00:57:46,529 --> 00:57:51,432
- We could try and do that through here.
- No. I like this. <i>That's</i> perfect.

678
00:57:51,534 --> 00:57:54,059
<i>Mr. Prater,</i>
<i>there's someone here to see you.</i>

679
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:57,162
- Sarah, <i>I'm</i> in a meeting.
<i>- It's your son.</i>

680
00:57:58,675 --> 00:58:01,439
- Would you like me to step out?
- No, <i>it's</i> OK.

681
00:58:01,544 --> 00:58:04,069
Sarah, send him in.

682
00:58:09,185 --> 00:58:12,951
- Matt, you OK?
- Sorry. I <i>didn't</i> know you were in a meeting.

683
00:58:13,056 --> 00:58:15,354
What is it, son?

684
00:58:17,527 --> 00:58:20,724
Dad, I just wanted to say
that <i>I'm</i> sorry.

685
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:23,799
<i>I'm</i> sorry for the way I've been acting.

686
00:58:25,568 --> 00:58:27,798
I got right with God today

687
00:58:27,904 --> 00:58:29,895
and I just needed to say

688
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:34,375
that from now on
I'll respect your authority.

689
00:58:34,477 --> 00:58:37,139
Whatever you say goes.

690
00:58:38,314 --> 00:58:40,976
<i>That's</i> it.

691
00:58:43,553 --> 00:58:47,148
You know, I could come back tomorrow
if that would be better for you.

692
00:58:47,257 --> 00:58:50,158
No. <i>It's</i> OK.

693
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:52,353
<i>I'm</i> sorry. I...

694
00:59:06,342 --> 00:59:08,333
For what <i>it's</i> worth,

695
00:59:08,444 --> 00:59:12,403
<i>I'd</i> give my right arm
to hear my son say that to me.

696
00:59:18,688 --> 00:59:22,556
I feel like <i>I'm</i> standing
before a new team tonight.

697
00:59:22,659 --> 00:59:25,890
<i>It's</i> a new day and a new game.

698
00:59:25,995 --> 00:59:30,056
What you've experienced in your hearts
this week will be released on the field.

699
00:59:30,166 --> 00:59:32,726
Stay humble but confident.

700
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:36,531
Why <i>don't</i> you take this one, Brock?

701
00:59:39,976 --> 00:59:42,672
Lord, we know
our lives are not about football,

702
00:59:42,779 --> 00:59:45,475
but we do thank you
for allowing us to play tonight.

703
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:47,846
We're gonna give you our best.

704
00:59:47,951 --> 00:59:51,546
If we win, we'll praise you
and if we lose, we'll praise you.

705
00:59:51,654 --> 00:59:55,215
We'll give you all the honor and the glory
for this night. Keep us safe.

706
00:59:55,325 --> 00:59:57,623
- Amen.
- Amen.

707
00:59:57,727 --> 01:00:00,321
All right, guys. Look at me.

708
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:02,990
Play hard, have fun.

709
01:00:09,639 --> 01:00:11,539
Hit.

710
01:01:09,132 --> 01:01:11,259
In the Old Testament,
Nehemiah had the task of

711
01:01:11,367 --> 01:01:13,961
building a wall around his city
for protection.

712
01:01:14,070 --> 01:01:17,164
But he <i>didn't</i> have enough people
or resources or time.

713
01:01:17,273 --> 01:01:20,299
Because each person worked on the wall
in front of their house,

714
01:01:20,410 --> 01:01:23,641
they got it done in record time.
<i>That's</i> what you're gonna do.

715
01:01:23,746 --> 01:01:27,876
On defense you have to resolve
nothing gets by you as an individual,

716
01:01:27,984 --> 01:01:29,975
nothing gets by us as a team.

717
01:01:30,086 --> 01:01:32,554
I need you to build me a stone wall.

718
01:02:20,136 --> 01:02:22,070
<i>Let's</i> go. <i>Let's</i> go.

719
01:02:22,171 --> 01:02:24,605
Run through
like you're throwing yourself.

720
01:02:25,408 --> 01:02:29,674
Come on. Hit somebody! I wanna see
some hitting. I wanna see some hitting.

721
01:02:29,779 --> 01:02:33,510
Dig those feet. Come on, you <i>ain't</i>
on my team yet. You <i>ain't</i> on my defense.

722
01:02:33,616 --> 01:02:37,177
You gotta dig those feet.
All right, Prater. Get in there, boy.

723
01:02:37,286 --> 01:02:39,311
Hit him a little harder than that.

724
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:42,391
This <i>ain't</i> ballet practice.
This is football practice.

725
01:03:12,455 --> 01:03:14,685
David.

726
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:15,951
David.
