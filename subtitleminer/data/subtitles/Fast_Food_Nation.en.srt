<i>Uh, what about,
"The Big One only gets bigger"?</i>

2
00:02:26,728 --> 00:02:28,696
"Everyone wants a Big One."

3
00:02:28,796 --> 00:02:31,094
I got a big one. Sorry.

4
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:35,067
<i>How about just, like, "Eat me."</i>

5
00:02:35,169 --> 00:02:38,764
Okay, okay. There's no shortage
of future slogans. Phil, what have you got?

6
00:02:38,873 --> 00:02:44,277
Well, um, same-store sales
are up 8.4% this quarter...

7
00:02:44,379 --> 00:02:46,472
which is just... amazing.

8
00:02:46,581 --> 00:02:49,414
<i>And the increase extends
across every demographic.</i>

9
00:02:49,517 --> 00:02:54,147
It's "tweens," heavy users,
minivan dads, even seniors.

10
00:02:54,255 --> 00:02:56,655
<i>So, clearly, the Big One
is not only a big hit...</i>

11
00:02:56,758 --> 00:02:59,420
it is quickly becoming
the flagship of our brand.

12
00:02:59,527 --> 00:03:02,621
Which we'll be building on, both in
the upcoming second half of our campaign...

13
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:04,630
and in merchandising.

14
00:03:04,732 --> 00:03:06,757
Terrific. Don, what about
those Little Big Ones?

15
00:03:06,868 --> 00:03:11,134
Well, uh, last week, you know,
we did a pretty extensive focus group...

16
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:14,003
with some of the kids
from Martin Luther King Elementary.

17
00:03:14,108 --> 00:03:16,008
- Yeah?
- And it went great.

18
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:18,772
Tested 91% in the top three boxes.
They loved 'em.

19
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,246
What is it now, eight to a bag?

20
00:03:21,349 --> 00:03:25,012
- No, no, no. You're thinking
about the Itty Bittys.
- Oh.

21
00:03:25,119 --> 00:03:28,179
No, no. We figure three Little Big Ones
for each kid's meal...

22
00:03:28,289 --> 00:03:30,450
is gonna work out about right.

23
00:03:30,558 --> 00:03:33,220
But we wanna do a little more
testing on that as well.

24
00:03:33,328 --> 00:03:36,820
- How about Disney?
- No word yet.

25
00:03:36,931 --> 00:03:40,765
<i>Also, the PBS deal
doesn't seem to be happening.</i>

26
00:03:40,868 --> 00:03:44,929
Uh, apparently Burger King and McDonald's
have the Teletubbies all locked up.

27
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,974
Fuck 'em.

28
00:03:57,652 --> 00:03:59,552
That's wonderful.

29
00:03:59,654 --> 00:04:01,815
Yeah? You like that?
That's the Barbecue Big One.

30
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:05,653
Wow. Tastes like it's
right off the grill.

31
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,320
You don't think it needs liquid smoke
or any other kind of flavorings?

32
00:04:08,429 --> 00:04:10,624
No. No, no, no.
I think it's perfect.

33
00:04:10,732 --> 00:04:13,633
- Let's test that.
- Okay. Try this one.

34
00:04:21,042 --> 00:04:24,239
- I don't know.
- Yeah. These Caribbean seasonings
are kind of tricky.

35
00:04:24,345 --> 00:04:26,779
We're calling 'em
Calypso Chicken Tenders.

36
00:04:26,881 --> 00:04:30,510
I think people are gonna
have an expectation for, uh...

37
00:04:30,618 --> 00:04:32,586
maybe a touch of lime.

38
00:04:32,687 --> 00:04:34,678
Oh, lime? Lime's easy.

39
00:04:34,789 --> 00:04:37,883
I just held back on the terpinoline on this
to keep the flavorings subtle.

40
00:04:37,992 --> 00:04:39,892
But I can always go back
and add more.

41
00:04:39,994 --> 00:04:42,929
- Yeah. Why don't you try that?
- I'll keep working on it.

42
00:04:43,031 --> 00:04:44,999
<i>I really, really enjoyed it. You were wonderful.</i>

43
00:04:45,099 --> 00:04:46,999
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

44
00:04:47,101 --> 00:04:49,695
Okay. Look, I gotta go.

45
00:04:49,804 --> 00:04:52,568
<i>I'll talk to you later.
Yeah, bye.</i>

46
00:04:52,673 --> 00:04:55,164
Thanks, Louise.

47
00:04:55,276 --> 00:04:58,439
Donny boy. Have a seat.

48
00:05:00,281 --> 00:05:02,476
Thanks for stopping by.

49
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:04,778
So, what do you think of everything?

50
00:05:04,886 --> 00:05:08,686
It's good, good.
I'm glad to see the Big One doin' so well.

51
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:13,227
Hmm. Listen, you ever
run into a guy named Harry Rydell...

52
00:05:13,327 --> 00:05:15,693
executive V.P.
out of the Chicago office?

53
00:05:15,797 --> 00:05:18,027
I don't think so.

54
00:05:18,132 --> 00:05:20,930
He works closely with our suppliers.

55
00:05:21,035 --> 00:05:24,801
A little too closely, if you ask me.

56
00:05:24,906 --> 00:05:27,067
What do you mean?

57
00:05:27,175 --> 00:05:32,579
I have a friend that teaches food science
over at A&M- microbiology.

58
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,376
And this semester,
a couple of his grad students...

59
00:05:35,483 --> 00:05:39,351
decided to culture some patties
from a bunch of fast-food chains.

60
00:05:39,454 --> 00:05:42,355
- Mm-hmm.
- Well-

61
00:05:42,457 --> 00:05:45,551
They got ahold of a couple
of Big Ones- frozen patties.

62
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,560
Don't ask me how.

63
00:05:47,662 --> 00:05:50,893
And the fecal coliform counts
were just off the charts.

64
00:05:52,266 --> 00:05:55,497
<i>I'm concerned that this
could be a problem for us.</i>

65
00:05:55,603 --> 00:05:57,833
Do you understand what I'm saying?

66
00:05:58,973 --> 00:06:02,272
Uh- Not exactly.

67
00:06:04,245 --> 00:06:07,214
I'm saying there's shit in the meat.

68
00:06:31,105 --> 00:06:32,367
Mm-hmm.

69
00:06:40,815 --> 00:06:42,612
Mmm.

70
00:06:59,934 --> 00:07:03,665
"The drawbridge was down.
The great gate stood wide.

71
00:07:03,771 --> 00:07:05,830
"I entered without challenge...

72
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:09,307
my own heels making
the only sounds I heard."

73
00:07:10,645 --> 00:07:13,375
- Keep going.
- No.

74
00:07:13,481 --> 00:07:17,144
- It's bedtime.
- Just one more.

75
00:07:17,251 --> 00:07:19,549
- Please.
- No. That's it.

76
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:25,926
Good night, Stevie.

77
00:07:27,662 --> 00:07:29,926
Hey.

78
00:07:30,031 --> 00:07:34,058
- I think I may have to miss
your history exhibit on Thursday.
- Why?

79
00:07:34,168 --> 00:07:38,969
Well, you know how Daddy has to go
out of town for work every now and then?

80
00:07:39,073 --> 00:07:42,008
- Yeah, but I thought you didn't have to.
- Well, not as much.

81
00:07:42,109 --> 00:07:45,010
But I gotta go to Colorado
for a couple of days.

82
00:07:45,112 --> 00:07:47,979
All right? I'll be home
for the weekend though.

83
00:07:48,082 --> 00:07:50,050
Okay.

84
00:07:50,151 --> 00:07:52,119
I love you guys.

85
00:07:53,821 --> 00:07:58,121
Too much E. coli in stuff. People could get sick.

86
00:07:58,226 --> 00:08:00,717
Is that the one that can kill kids?

87
00:08:00,828 --> 00:08:03,592
I don't know. I don't think so.

88
00:08:03,698 --> 00:08:06,633
I mean,
nobody's gotten sick or anything.

89
00:08:06,734 --> 00:08:10,397
But Jack says too much cow manure
is somehow getting into the meat.

90
00:08:10,504 --> 00:08:12,472
<i>That's disgusting.</i>

91
00:08:12,573 --> 00:08:17,135
That's my new job. Same office-
still dealing with bullshit.

92
00:08:17,245 --> 00:08:20,544
<i>Well, I guess it is a marketing issue after all.</i>

93
00:08:20,648 --> 00:08:22,878
If the kids die
from eating your burgers...

94
00:08:22,984 --> 00:08:24,952
it makes them much harder to sell.

95
00:08:25,052 --> 00:08:27,043
That's right. Marketing 101.

96
00:08:27,154 --> 00:08:29,122
Don't kill the customer.

97
00:08:29,223 --> 00:08:31,987
Bad for repeat business.

98
00:08:48,843 --> 00:08:49,810
Mm-hmm.

99
00:09:15,403 --> 00:09:17,428
<i>¿Coco?</i>

100
00:09:19,907 --> 00:09:20,965
<i>¿Coco?</i>

101
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:06,813
Hi.

102
00:11:06,914 --> 00:11:08,882
<i>No.</i>

103
00:11:10,384 --> 00:11:12,147
I sent that form in. I paid it.

104
00:11:12,253 --> 00:11:14,983
<i>Hey, you tell that coach
and that whole fucking league...</i>

105
00:11:15,089 --> 00:11:18,490
if he doesn't play,
I'm gonna kick all their asses.

106
00:11:18,592 --> 00:11:21,584
<i>Sí. Yeah, yeah.</i>

107
00:11:21,695 --> 00:11:23,993
I just did a pickup.
I'll talk to you later.

108
00:16:11,218 --> 00:16:13,083
Gracias.

109
00:16:27,568 --> 00:16:30,093
No.

110
00:16:31,371 --> 00:16:33,669
<i>- Sí.
- Sí.</i>

111
00:16:41,582 --> 00:16:44,949
<i>Oh, God! Yeah!</i>

112
00:16:45,052 --> 00:16:47,680
<i>You like the way that feels?</i>

113
00:16:51,058 --> 00:16:53,219
Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my gosh!

114
00:16:53,327 --> 00:16:57,127
That's right, bitch.

115
00:16:58,632 --> 00:17:02,500
- Do you like it when I pull your hair?
- Yes! Yes, pull my hair!

116
00:17:02,603 --> 00:17:06,505
- That's right, slut.
- I love it when you call me "slut."

117
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,666
Let's go. Stand up.

118
00:17:09,777 --> 00:17:12,541
Yo. Stand up.
Come on. Stand up.

119
00:17:13,981 --> 00:17:15,949
Hey!

120
00:17:18,185 --> 00:17:20,153
Stand up.

121
00:17:25,626 --> 00:17:26,991
What the fuck you doin'?

122
00:17:30,531 --> 00:17:32,692
Fuckin' people on vacation.

123
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,970
Go.

124
00:18:19,947 --> 00:18:23,348
Hang on a second.

125
00:18:26,854 --> 00:18:29,482
Welcome to Mickeys.
Can I take your order?

126
00:18:31,091 --> 00:18:34,822
Yeah. I'm thinkin' about a Big One.

127
00:18:34,928 --> 00:18:36,919
Okay. Would you like
some large fries with that?

128
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:39,260
No. No, thanks. Not tonight.

129
00:18:39,366 --> 00:18:43,200
- Our supervalue drink?
- I'll have a chocolate shake and a water.

130
00:18:43,303 --> 00:18:45,863
All right. Would you like
any dessert with that?

131
00:18:45,973 --> 00:18:48,771
- A brownie pie or a turnover?
- No, not tonight.

132
00:18:48,876 --> 00:18:52,403
Okay. Uh, that'll be 4.98.

133
00:18:52,512 --> 00:18:55,948
Okay. Here you go.

134
00:18:58,785 --> 00:19:01,276
<i>So, what's your favorite thing
on the menu?</i>

135
00:19:01,388 --> 00:19:03,185
I like everything.

136
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:05,588
Well, I know that's not true.

137
00:19:05,692 --> 00:19:08,525
But you did give me
the correct answer.

138
00:19:08,629 --> 00:19:11,427
I was just testing you. I'm actually
a vice president of marketing for Mickeys.

139
00:19:11,531 --> 00:19:14,295
- Really?
- Yeah. It's true.

140
00:19:14,401 --> 00:19:18,428
Just here in town for a couple of days
seein' where the Big Ones come from.

141
00:19:18,538 --> 00:19:21,098
<i>- Here?
- Oh, no, not here.</i>

142
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:23,199
<i>But at Uni-Globe Meat Packing
just outside of town.</i>

143
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:27,508
That's where every single Big One patty
in the entire country gets made.

144
00:19:27,614 --> 00:19:30,276
<i>- No way.
- Yeah.</i>

145
00:19:30,384 --> 00:19:32,818
- It's amazing.
- Wow.

146
00:19:33,921 --> 00:19:35,582
Lettuce.

147
00:19:35,689 --> 00:19:39,648
Pickles and cheese.

148
00:19:40,794 --> 00:19:42,853
Special-

149
00:19:45,032 --> 00:19:46,932
I think I burned the meat.

150
00:19:58,545 --> 00:20:02,072
Amber. Order up.

151
00:20:07,721 --> 00:20:10,690
- There you go.
- Okay. Thank you.

152
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:13,589
- What's your name?
- Amber.

153
00:20:13,694 --> 00:20:16,356
Right. Don Anderson.

154
00:20:16,463 --> 00:20:18,294
- It's nice to meet you.
- You too.

155
00:20:18,398 --> 00:20:21,367
- Maybe I'll see you around.
- All right. I'm always here.

156
00:20:21,468 --> 00:20:23,595
<i>Bye.</i>

157
00:20:23,704 --> 00:20:26,696
Brian, can I get a Coffee Freezer?

158
00:22:44,211 --> 00:22:47,647
<i>Bring it over to the scalding tank.</i>

159
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:31,284
Amber, hon,
electric is 131 for last month.

160
00:23:32,459 --> 00:23:35,189
Mom, I gotta pay my car insurance.

161
00:23:35,295 --> 00:23:37,354
Well, anything helps.

162
00:23:37,464 --> 00:23:39,694
So how's your day lookin'?

163
00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:42,393
I have band practice after school,
then work at 6:00.

164
00:23:42,502 --> 00:23:46,302
Well, don't let them
keep you past 10:00.

165
00:23:46,406 --> 00:23:49,671
<i>I'll try to get out of there. Tony's been
pretty cool about letting me out early.</i>

166
00:23:49,776 --> 00:23:52,904
Good.

167
00:24:30,417 --> 00:24:32,317
Hey.

168
00:24:35,255 --> 00:24:37,223
<i>- Hey, Amber.
- Hey, David.</i>

169
00:25:09,589 --> 00:25:11,682
<i>- Hola.
- Hola.</i>

170
00:25:42,856 --> 00:25:44,448
Mm-hmm.

171
00:25:55,568 --> 00:25:56,592
Mm-hmm.

172
00:26:25,498 --> 00:26:27,227
Hmm.

173
00:27:06,206 --> 00:27:08,071
<i>And right over here, Don...</i>

174
00:27:08,174 --> 00:27:10,369
we mix our product
with a low-fat product...

175
00:27:10,477 --> 00:27:12,741
from about a half a dozen
other plants.

176
00:27:38,872 --> 00:27:42,103
<i>The liquefied gas in the cylinder...</i>

177
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:45,609
takes 'em down
to 40 degrees below zero!

178
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,992
<i>Wow. That's a lot of Big Ones.</i>

179
00:28:10,103 --> 00:28:14,164
Yeah. Well, somewhere
in Kansas City...

180
00:28:14,274 --> 00:28:16,401
someone will be eating these
tomorrow night.

181
00:28:40,133 --> 00:28:43,899
<i>...can be used to explain
how accidents happen to other people.</i>

182
00:28:44,003 --> 00:28:47,166
<i>But accidents don't just
happen to other people.</i>

183
00:28:47,273 --> 00:28:51,334
Accident prevention
is each individual's responsibility.

184
00:28:51,444 --> 00:28:55,847
This program is designed to make you
think more about accident causes...

185
00:28:55,949 --> 00:28:58,543
and how you can prevent injuries.

186
00:28:58,651 --> 00:29:01,176
<i>If you eliminate
the cause of accidents...</i>

187
00:29:01,287 --> 00:29:05,383
you're on your way to an accident-free
workplace and lifetime.

188
00:29:05,492 --> 00:29:08,393
<i>Safety works in your home also.
It works when you're-</i>

189
00:29:14,501 --> 00:29:17,959
Yo. You heard about
the robbery last night?

190
00:29:18,071 --> 00:29:21,165
- No. Where?
- At the McDonald's over on Cayenne.

191
00:29:21,274 --> 00:29:23,799
They came in at closing time
and put everyone in the basement.

192
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:25,673
<i>Said they'd get shot
if they came out.</i>

193
00:29:25,778 --> 00:29:28,906
- And boom- 6,000 bucks.
- No way.

194
00:29:29,015 --> 00:29:31,142
- Yeah. 6,000 in cash.
- In cash?

195
00:29:31,251 --> 00:29:35,347
Hell's yeah. How many times you seen somebody
buy their McNuggets with a credit card?

196
00:29:35,455 --> 00:29:38,618
- Good point.
- They said it was the third
fast-food place in Cody...

197
00:29:38,725 --> 00:29:41,319
to get robbed in the last few weeks.

198
00:29:41,427 --> 00:29:45,227
<i>They hit Fuddruckers on Thursday night.
We're probably next.</i>

199
00:29:45,331 --> 00:29:47,299
All the more reason
for you guys to quit.

200
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,425
I mean, why do you even work there?

201
00:29:49,536 --> 00:29:52,266
Not all of us can get hired
at the Banana Republic.

202
00:30:00,246 --> 00:30:02,476
Yo! Fuck y'all doin' in my truck?

203
00:30:08,621 --> 00:30:09,918
Mike.

204
00:30:25,305 --> 00:30:28,797
Yeah, the Big One's been great.
Really great.

205
00:30:28,908 --> 00:30:32,173
Sales keep creepin' up.
There's been no drop off.

206
00:30:32,278 --> 00:30:34,246
That's what we're hearin'.

207
00:30:34,347 --> 00:30:36,474
- I've had this location 12 years.
- Yeah?

208
00:30:36,583 --> 00:30:38,915
And you'd have to go way back-

209
00:30:39,018 --> 00:30:42,579
maybe even to the original Teeny-Weenys
promotion- to see anything like this.

210
00:30:42,689 --> 00:30:45,886
- You guys hit a home run.
- Well, hey, we all did.

211
00:30:45,992 --> 00:30:49,120
Definitely.

212
00:30:49,228 --> 00:30:52,959
Hey, Tony, have you ever-
Have you ever been out to the U.M.P. plant?

213
00:30:53,066 --> 00:30:55,591
Uh, no, I haven't.

214
00:30:57,737 --> 00:30:59,830
I've been hearin' some mixed things
about the place.

215
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,572
I've heard all sorts
of nasty stuff goes on there.

216
00:31:03,676 --> 00:31:06,406
You have? Like what?

217
00:31:08,881 --> 00:31:11,008
I don't know. Um-

218
00:31:11,117 --> 00:31:13,347
I used to have a friend
who used to work there...

219
00:31:13,453 --> 00:31:15,978
and he used to tell me
all sorts of things.

220
00:31:16,089 --> 00:31:19,024
Did you know that's where
the Big Ones come from?

221
00:31:21,127 --> 00:31:23,095
This was a long time back.
I mean-

222
00:31:23,196 --> 00:31:25,164
Look, my friend could have
been full of shit.

223
00:31:25,264 --> 00:31:28,290
Yeah, 'cause I was out there.
I mean, the place is-

224
00:31:28,401 --> 00:31:30,301
It's spotless.

225
00:31:30,403 --> 00:31:34,772
<i>- Yeah?
- Oh, yeah. It's high-tech, state-of-the-art stuff.</i>

226
00:31:34,874 --> 00:31:36,842
Stainless steel everywhere.

227
00:31:36,943 --> 00:31:40,310
People wearin' gloves and clean white coats.
I mean-

228
00:31:40,413 --> 00:31:42,438
Well, might be a lot different now.

229
00:31:48,488 --> 00:31:52,618
So, um, the friend-You think I might
be able to give him a call?

230
00:31:52,725 --> 00:31:54,716
I don't know.
He split a long time ago.

231
00:31:54,827 --> 00:31:57,352
I haven't really talked to him.

232
00:31:57,463 --> 00:31:59,624
Well- Right.

233
00:32:03,636 --> 00:32:06,400
My wife's got an uncle.
He can tell you all about that place.

234
00:32:06,506 --> 00:32:09,373
- Does he work out there?
- Oh, no, no. He used to sell 'em cattle.

235
00:32:09,475 --> 00:32:11,375
But he's a real... character.

236
00:32:11,477 --> 00:32:13,877
You know, been on the ranch
a little too long.

237
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:17,143
You think he'd talk to me?

238
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:19,218
Oh, he'll talk to you.

239
00:32:19,318 --> 00:32:22,515
Might scare you though.
He's a little intense.

240
00:32:22,622 --> 00:32:26,820
I'll give you his number.
His name is Rudy.

241
00:32:39,338 --> 00:32:40,669
Hey. Hey!

242
00:32:40,773 --> 00:32:42,832
What the fuck you doin'?
What the fuck-

243
00:32:42,942 --> 00:32:46,605
Are you fuckin' retarded?

244
00:32:53,319 --> 00:32:55,480
Say it. "Grade 'A'." Say it.

245
00:32:55,588 --> 00:32:57,556
- Grade "A."
- Thank you.

246
00:32:57,657 --> 00:33:00,353
Fuckin' know you understand me.
You people act like I'm a fuckin' retard.

247
00:33:05,631 --> 00:33:08,191
<i>- Sí.
- Get back to work.</i>

248
00:33:34,527 --> 00:33:36,495
Coco.

249
00:34:25,645 --> 00:34:29,012
Yeah, like that. Like that.

250
00:34:29,115 --> 00:34:32,778
Like that.

251
00:34:56,442 --> 00:35:00,469
You know, if that safe in McDonald's
was holding six grand...

252
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:02,980
Tony must have at least five or six
locked away in there.

253
00:35:03,082 --> 00:35:06,882
Maybe more. You think he goes
to the bank every day?

254
00:35:06,986 --> 00:35:09,420
That's a good question.

255
00:35:09,522 --> 00:35:12,047
Tim says that over where he works...

256
00:35:12,158 --> 00:35:14,058
that they don't even have a safe.

257
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,526
That's 'cause nobody ever eats there.

258
00:35:16,629 --> 00:35:19,496
That chicken fajita I had the other night
was some slimy shit.

259
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:23,330
Yeah, well, there's a reason
why it only costs 99 cents.

260
00:35:24,737 --> 00:35:28,229
There may be five or six grand
in Tony's safe every night...

261
00:35:28,341 --> 00:35:31,936
just sittin' in there, while we're out here
gettin' paid dick to mess with this shit.

262
00:35:32,044 --> 00:35:34,444
Yeah, no kidding.

263
00:35:34,547 --> 00:35:36,515
And Tony's a real prick too,
you know?

264
00:35:36,616 --> 00:35:38,584
I always catch him
checkin' out Amber's ass...

265
00:35:38,684 --> 00:35:40,618
and he's, like, five times her age.

266
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:46,283
Hey, the cops must have these places
totally staked out at night.

267
00:35:46,392 --> 00:35:50,385
'Cause they're just waitin' for another robbery.

268
00:35:50,496 --> 00:35:53,431
The best time to do it would be
first thing in the morning...

269
00:35:53,532 --> 00:35:55,432
around opening time.

270
00:35:55,534 --> 00:35:58,401
Okay. Here's how it goes down.

271
00:35:58,504 --> 00:36:00,369
We come in here
first thing in the morning.

272
00:36:00,473 --> 00:36:02,737
- It's still dark, no traffic.
- Uh-huh.

273
00:36:02,842 --> 00:36:05,606
Everybody's feelin' calm and sleepy.

274
00:36:08,814 --> 00:36:12,045
We'll be taking this order to go,
motherfucker.

275
00:36:12,151 --> 00:36:14,415
If you got the balls, bitch.

276
00:36:17,657 --> 00:36:21,252
<i>I'm supposed to go out to some ranch.</i>

277
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,726
Maybe that'll be worth something.
I don't know.

278
00:36:23,829 --> 00:36:27,128
Well, I'm meetin' with Harry
on Friday.

279
00:36:27,233 --> 00:36:30,168
So I should be back on Saturday.

280
00:36:30,269 --> 00:36:32,237
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Put-Put him on.

281
00:36:32,338 --> 00:36:37,241
<i>- ...but the disease that spreads-
- Who's this?</i>

282
00:36:37,343 --> 00:36:39,903
Hello, Stevie.

283
00:37:41,307 --> 00:37:45,004
Couple of guys invited me to a party
at the "U" on Saturday night.

284
00:37:45,111 --> 00:37:47,011
You wanna come?

285
00:37:47,113 --> 00:37:49,274
Do they know you go to Cody?

286
00:37:49,382 --> 00:37:52,180
For some reason,
they think I'm a freshman in college.

287
00:37:52,284 --> 00:37:54,252
Oh, I wonder why.

288
00:37:54,353 --> 00:37:57,015
One of them is really hot.

289
00:37:57,123 --> 00:37:59,717
Oh, I gotta work that night.

290
00:37:59,825 --> 00:38:02,726
You work way too much.

291
00:38:29,522 --> 00:38:31,615
You the one that called?

292
00:38:31,724 --> 00:38:33,783
Yeah. Hi there. I'm Don.

293
00:38:33,893 --> 00:38:35,690
Climb on over.

294
00:38:44,703 --> 00:38:48,070
<i>- Ever been out here before?
- Nope.</i>

295
00:38:48,174 --> 00:38:51,041
It's beautiful.

296
00:38:51,143 --> 00:38:53,543
You ever been on a ranch before?

297
00:38:53,646 --> 00:38:58,174
Yeah, when I was a kid, at camp.

298
00:39:00,886 --> 00:39:03,252
<i>How, uh- How many acres
do you have, Rudy?</i>

299
00:39:03,355 --> 00:39:07,951
Well, you wouldn't want to have to walk
your way outta here. That's for sure.

300
00:39:17,002 --> 00:39:19,630
Come on up
and meet my new neighbors.

301
00:39:19,738 --> 00:39:22,969
Aw. No.

302
00:39:23,075 --> 00:39:24,975
Aw, geez.

303
00:39:26,245 --> 00:39:28,907
<i>- When did all this happen?
- Last couple of years.</i>

304
00:39:29,014 --> 00:39:32,973
Local rancher lost control
of the land.

305
00:39:33,085 --> 00:39:37,283
Banks took it and sold it
to real estate speculators.

306
00:39:49,835 --> 00:39:51,803
What the hell happened over there?

307
00:39:51,904 --> 00:39:55,305
<i>- Meth freaks.
- Out here?</i>

308
00:39:55,407 --> 00:39:58,843
<i>They find a quiet little place,
start cookin'-</i>

309
00:39:58,944 --> 00:40:01,504
till somethin' blows up
or burns down.

310
00:40:01,614 --> 00:40:03,514
Wow.

311
00:40:03,616 --> 00:40:08,280
<i>Past year and a half,
I've had two bodies dumped on my land.</i>

312
00:40:08,387 --> 00:40:10,355
Dead bodies?

313
00:40:10,456 --> 00:40:13,653
One of 'em was rolled up
in this nice-lookin' carpet.

314
00:40:13,759 --> 00:40:15,727
Scared the shit out of my foreman.

315
00:40:15,828 --> 00:40:19,161
<i>They dump dead dogs and cats...</i>

316
00:40:19,265 --> 00:40:21,392
and all other sorts of garbage
on my land.

317
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:25,800
Seems like I spend half my time
just defendin' the place.

318
00:40:25,905 --> 00:40:29,068
I gotta go to court next week...

319
00:40:29,175 --> 00:40:32,542
to fight off some private
corporation from Denver...

320
00:40:32,645 --> 00:40:35,079
wants to build a toll road
across my land.

321
00:40:35,181 --> 00:40:37,513
<i>Eminent domain, my ass.</i>

322
00:40:37,616 --> 00:40:40,881
They got another word for it-
robbery.

323
00:40:45,191 --> 00:40:48,024
You wanna open that up for me?

324
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:06,578
You should get a clicker.

325
00:41:10,082 --> 00:41:14,382
Hey, Rudy. You know anybody
over at Uni-Globe Meat Packing?

326
00:41:14,486 --> 00:41:17,455
- Sure.
- What do you think of 'em?

327
00:41:17,556 --> 00:41:19,581
I think they're a fine bunch.

328
00:41:19,692 --> 00:41:21,592
Really?

329
00:41:21,694 --> 00:41:24,094
They'll slit your throat
for a nickel.

330
00:41:24,196 --> 00:41:27,256
Nothin' personal.
They just want the extra nickel.

331
00:41:28,801 --> 00:41:32,794
- Well, who do you know over there?
- I know all of 'em.

332
00:41:32,905 --> 00:41:36,397
- I sold cattle to 'em for years.
- Oh.

333
00:41:36,508 --> 00:41:39,136
More important, I know their type.

334
00:41:39,245 --> 00:41:42,578
They are the meanest, toughest sons of bitches,
and they're proud of it.

335
00:41:42,681 --> 00:41:45,241
But that's nothin' new.

336
00:41:45,351 --> 00:41:50,448
My granddad went up
against the meat packers in 1919.

337
00:41:50,556 --> 00:41:53,548
Testified in Congress
about their price-fixing.

338
00:41:54,793 --> 00:41:57,660
And after that, none of them
would buy his cattle.

339
00:41:57,763 --> 00:42:01,426
U.M.P. and all the rest
tried to run him out of the business.

340
00:42:01,533 --> 00:42:04,468
- Okay, but that was a long time ago.
- Yeah.

341
00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:09,337
And the big packers are even worse today.
They're even bigger today.

342
00:42:09,441 --> 00:42:11,068
- Really?
- And meaner.

343
00:42:11,176 --> 00:42:14,475
Hell, old Dwight D. Eisenhower
would've shut 'em down.

344
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:16,548
He wouldn't have stood
for their crap.

345
00:42:18,183 --> 00:42:21,175
Do you think they would knowingly
sell us contaminated meat?

346
00:42:21,287 --> 00:42:23,187
Oh, come on.

347
00:42:23,289 --> 00:42:26,258
Workers are gettin'
their arms cut off over there.

348
00:42:26,358 --> 00:42:28,326
You don't know
who you're dealin' with.

349
00:42:28,427 --> 00:42:30,395
No. No, I don't.
Please, help me.

350
00:42:30,496 --> 00:42:33,363
I- I was at the plant.
It seemed clean to me.

351
00:42:33,465 --> 00:42:35,933
They show you the kill floor?

352
00:42:36,035 --> 00:42:38,162
I don't know.
I saw a lot of things.

353
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:40,431
You'd remember.

354
00:42:40,539 --> 00:42:43,975
You see any cattle
gettin' their heads cut off?

355
00:42:44,076 --> 00:42:46,772
Were you walkin' ankle-deep in blood?

356
00:42:46,879 --> 00:42:49,677
No.

357
00:42:49,782 --> 00:42:52,945
So they didn't show you a damn thing.

358
00:42:53,052 --> 00:42:55,612
Okay, but how-

359
00:42:55,721 --> 00:42:59,657
How... would cow manure
get into the meat?

360
00:43:00,993 --> 00:43:03,484
Rita.

361
00:43:06,832 --> 00:43:08,356
- No, no. Thanks, I'm fine.
- You sure?

362
00:43:08,467 --> 00:43:10,526
- Yes, thank you.
- I'll have some.

363
00:43:10,636 --> 00:43:14,072
Hey, Rita, is your brother
still workin' over at U.M.P.?

364
00:43:19,011 --> 00:43:20,740
How's he doin'?

365
00:43:20,846 --> 00:43:24,247
Oh, he has a good job now.
He's a supervisor in Trim.

366
00:43:24,350 --> 00:43:27,319
- Hmm.
- Mr. Anderson here would like to know...

367
00:43:27,419 --> 00:43:29,387
if the meat over there is clean.

368
00:43:31,357 --> 00:43:33,689
He wants to know how cow manure...

369
00:43:33,792 --> 00:43:37,057
could ever possibly wind up
in his hamburger.

370
00:43:37,162 --> 00:43:39,494
Well, there's lots of ways.

371
00:43:39,598 --> 00:43:41,930
My brother used to work
at the gut table.

372
00:43:42,034 --> 00:43:45,697
And, you know, they have
to pull out the intestines and the stomachs.

373
00:43:45,804 --> 00:43:49,797
<i>And they just don't have enough time
to do it right.</i>

374
00:43:49,908 --> 00:43:52,274
The line is moving too fast.

375
00:43:52,378 --> 00:43:57,077
<i>So when they're pulling the guts out-
and they make a mistake-</i>

376
00:43:57,182 --> 00:44:00,049
all the poop and stuff
just pours out all over the meat.

377
00:44:00,152 --> 00:44:03,280
Okay, okay, okay.
All right.

378
00:44:03,389 --> 00:44:05,289
But, really,
how often does that happen?

379
00:44:06,458 --> 00:44:08,358
Every day.

380
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:13,193
<i>- We got any cookies back there?
- I'll bring a plate of them.</i>

381
00:44:13,298 --> 00:44:15,357
Anything else you want to know?

382
00:44:15,467 --> 00:44:20,234
No. No, that's, uh, plenty. Thanks.

383
00:44:21,907 --> 00:44:25,308
This isn't about good people
versus bad people.

384
00:44:25,411 --> 00:44:27,971
It's about the machine
that's taking over this country.

385
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:30,241
It's like somethin'
out of science fiction.

386
00:44:31,550 --> 00:44:36,249
The land, the cattle, human beings.

387
00:44:37,556 --> 00:44:40,218
This machine don't give a shit.

388
00:44:40,325 --> 00:44:43,385
Pennies a pound.
Pennies a pound.

389
00:44:43,495 --> 00:44:46,794
That's all it cares about.
A few more pennies a pound.

390
00:44:48,901 --> 00:44:50,869
Sounds pretty bleak.

391
00:44:50,969 --> 00:44:53,938
By the way, Don,
you seem like a nice fella.

392
00:44:54,039 --> 00:44:56,974
But the food
your company sells is crap-

393
00:44:57,075 --> 00:44:58,975
total crap-

394
00:44:59,077 --> 00:45:01,136
even when there isn't manure in it.

395
00:46:27,666 --> 00:46:30,658
Eh?

396
00:46:46,818 --> 00:46:49,116
<i>Sí.</i>

397
00:46:52,124 --> 00:46:54,092
<i>Bueno.</i>

398
00:47:44,509 --> 00:47:48,001
<i>Ándale.</i>

399
00:47:48,213 --> 00:47:50,807
Thank God old Mr. Nathan come in.

400
00:47:50,916 --> 00:47:52,907
He took one look at me.
Said, "Harry...

401
00:47:53,018 --> 00:47:56,283
"you are the scariest
fucking clown I've ever seen.

402
00:47:56,388 --> 00:47:59,789
<i>Take that off immediately."
And that was that.</i>

403
00:47:59,891 --> 00:48:02,451
<i>I came about that close
to becoming the first Mickey.</i>

404
00:48:02,561 --> 00:48:06,361
<i>Which would have been a disaster,
because I'd have probably killed somebody.</i>

405
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:12,593
Mmm. What do you think?
I know it's not Mickeys.

406
00:48:12,704 --> 00:48:15,298
- Mmm.
- But it's good, right? Good burger.

407
00:48:15,407 --> 00:48:18,035
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's-It's great.

408
00:48:20,379 --> 00:48:23,780
- Harry, what's goin' on out at U.M.P.?
- Beg your pardon?

409
00:48:23,882 --> 00:48:27,784
Yeah, what's really goin' on out there-
with the meat?

410
00:48:27,886 --> 00:48:30,150
<i>You're supposed to be
our conduit to that place.</i>

411
00:48:30,255 --> 00:48:33,486
- They didn't give you the tour?
- Yeah. Yeah.

412
00:48:33,592 --> 00:48:36,026
Who took you through there?

413
00:48:36,161 --> 00:48:38,061
Uh, Terry?

414
00:48:38,163 --> 00:48:40,358
<i>- Oh, boy.
- No, no, no.</i>

415
00:48:40,465 --> 00:48:42,456
He was- Listen, he was great.
He was fine.

416
00:48:42,567 --> 00:48:44,535
I just-

417
00:48:44,636 --> 00:48:46,729
I've been talkin'
to a lot of people around town...

418
00:48:46,838 --> 00:48:48,965
and I've been hearing
some bad things about that plant.

419
00:48:49,074 --> 00:48:51,838
<i>You know, things
they don't show you on the tour.</i>

420
00:48:53,578 --> 00:48:56,513
Sounds like they might be running
the production line too fast, you know?

421
00:48:56,615 --> 00:48:59,812
<i>- Hmm.
- People are gettin' hurt out there every day.</i>

422
00:48:59,918 --> 00:49:02,478
<i>They're gettin' cut up.</i>

423
00:49:02,587 --> 00:49:04,578
One guy lost his entire arm.

424
00:49:05,991 --> 00:49:07,982
<i>These poor Mexicans,
they come over here...</i>

425
00:49:08,093 --> 00:49:10,561
<i>and U.M.P. treats 'em like shit.</i>

426
00:49:10,662 --> 00:49:12,630
And the meat-
I gotta tell you somethin'.

427
00:49:12,731 --> 00:49:14,858
Harry, the meat is filthy.

428
00:49:14,966 --> 00:49:18,231
Do you know they got untrained people
workin' at the gut table?

429
00:49:18,336 --> 00:49:21,396
<i>- Really? The gut table?
- Yeah. I mean-</i>

430
00:49:21,506 --> 00:49:25,340
<i>- Harry, there's shit in our meat.
- Harry.</i>

431
00:49:25,444 --> 00:49:27,412
- Hi.
- Hey.

432
00:49:27,512 --> 00:49:29,844
- I heard you were here today.
- How are you doin', huh?

433
00:49:29,948 --> 00:49:33,247
- Ah, can't complain.
- Good. Lisa, I want you to meet Don Anderson.

434
00:49:33,351 --> 00:49:37,845
- He just came to the company from CNN.
- ESPN actually.

435
00:49:37,956 --> 00:49:40,390
- Don is the inventor of the Big One.
- Really?

436
00:49:40,492 --> 00:49:42,517
No. My team came up with the name.

437
00:49:42,627 --> 00:49:45,619
You're just being humble.
It was pure genius, Don.

438
00:49:45,731 --> 00:49:48,131
- It's a good name for a burger, isn't it?
- It sure is.

439
00:49:48,233 --> 00:49:51,896
It's very nice to meet you.
Can I get you another Fat Tire?

440
00:49:52,003 --> 00:49:54,563
I would love another Fat Tire.
You want a beer, Don?

441
00:49:54,673 --> 00:49:56,573
- No, thanks.
- Just one.

442
00:49:56,675 --> 00:49:58,768
- All right.
- Just one. All right.

443
00:50:01,313 --> 00:50:03,611
Mmm!

444
00:50:10,555 --> 00:50:12,455
You know...

445
00:50:12,557 --> 00:50:16,049
I think there might be a little bit of shit
right here in this meat.

446
00:50:16,161 --> 00:50:18,789
Just a teeny little bit.
Microscopic.

447
00:50:18,897 --> 00:50:24,301
Your tests say that the meat
we're getting from U.M.P. is clean.

448
00:50:24,402 --> 00:50:28,270
It's not. I've seen independent tests
that say that it's not.

449
00:50:28,373 --> 00:50:30,432
There's always been
a little shit in the meat.

450
00:50:30,542 --> 00:50:32,510
You've probably been
eatin' it your whole life.

451
00:50:32,611 --> 00:50:36,172
Yeah? Well, I prefer not to, Harry.

452
00:50:36,281 --> 00:50:39,546
Well, I don't know
who you been talkin' to, Don...

453
00:50:39,651 --> 00:50:43,951
but there is absolutely nothing illegal
goin' on here, okay?

454
00:50:44,055 --> 00:50:46,182
Meat is supposed to be cooked.

455
00:50:46,291 --> 00:50:49,317
And the grills at Mickeys
are calibrated carefully...

456
00:50:49,427 --> 00:50:54,626
to make sure it kills every little bit
of the bad stuff that's in there.

457
00:50:54,733 --> 00:50:56,997
<i>- That might be kinda tough
to explain to our customers.
- Explain what?</i>

458
00:50:57,102 --> 00:51:00,469
Listen, there is cow shit in our meat
because we're running the line too fast.

459
00:51:00,572 --> 00:51:03,939
Just cook it.
That's all you need to do.

460
00:51:04,042 --> 00:51:08,069
<i>You see? That's one of the things
that's just buggin' me about this country.</i>

461
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:10,080
Really buggin' me.

462
00:51:10,182 --> 00:51:13,242
Americans have become
these-these great big fraidy cats.

463
00:51:13,351 --> 00:51:17,310
Afraid of everything.
Everything's gotta be sterile and germfree.

464
00:51:17,422 --> 00:51:19,390
Well, everybody needs to grow up.

465
00:51:19,491 --> 00:51:22,324
That's what they need.

466
00:51:22,427 --> 00:51:25,453
You wanna be safe?
Huh? Perfectly safe?

467
00:51:25,564 --> 00:51:28,226
Well, forget about it.
That's not gonna happen. Okay?

468
00:51:28,333 --> 00:51:30,301
Everybody just needs
to get that through their head.

469
00:51:30,402 --> 00:51:34,304
Just cook the meat,
and you'll be fine.

470
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:37,508
I can't believe I'm hearing this.

471
00:51:37,609 --> 00:51:40,271
You've known all about this?

472
00:51:40,378 --> 00:51:42,346
I'm shocked.

473
00:51:45,050 --> 00:51:48,577
Donny boy, you just gotta try and step back
and look at the big picture.

474
00:51:48,687 --> 00:51:53,021
40,000 people die
in automobile accidents every year.

475
00:51:53,124 --> 00:51:55,092
Does that mean Detroit
should stop making cars?

476
00:51:55,193 --> 00:51:57,252
<i>Does it?</i>

477
00:51:57,362 --> 00:52:00,559
<i>Of course not.</i>

478
00:52:00,665 --> 00:52:02,690
You ever been down to Mexico?

479
00:52:02,801 --> 00:52:04,894
<i>- What's that have to do with anything?
- It's beautiful down there.</i>

480
00:52:05,003 --> 00:52:08,234
Really beautiful.
Great beaches. Gorgeous.

481
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:11,537
<i>But poor. Poor.</i>

482
00:52:11,643 --> 00:52:13,907
<i>Poorest fuckin' place
I ever been, I think.</i>

483
00:52:14,012 --> 00:52:18,346
Guy down there makes three,
maybe four dollars a day.

484
00:52:18,450 --> 00:52:20,350
A day, Don.

485
00:52:20,452 --> 00:52:23,717
<i>Now, that same guy,
he comes up here...</i>

486
00:52:23,822 --> 00:52:26,222
he gets a job workin' for U.M.P.-

487
00:52:26,324 --> 00:52:28,292
makin' $10 an hour.

488
00:52:28,393 --> 00:52:33,695
That's more money in one day
than he makes back home in a whole month.

489
00:52:33,798 --> 00:52:36,790
So, frankly, I don't see the problem.

490
00:52:36,902 --> 00:52:40,736
Nobody's makin' these people
come up here. Right?

491
00:52:40,839 --> 00:52:43,364
Nobody's tellin' them
to come work for U.M.P.

492
00:52:43,475 --> 00:52:45,739
<i>- Okay, okay. But that's not the point.
- And you know what?</i>

493
00:52:45,844 --> 00:52:47,835
I admire these people. Okay?

494
00:52:47,946 --> 00:52:50,278
I really do.
They're hard workers.

495
00:52:50,382 --> 00:52:54,250
They're workin' hard, and they're trying
to improve their lives. Okay?

496
00:52:54,352 --> 00:52:56,320
<i>Now, isn't that
what our ancestors did?</i>

497
00:52:56,421 --> 00:53:00,824
Isn't that what made this country
the great country that it is today? Huh?

498
00:53:00,926 --> 00:53:02,894
<i>And you wanna try and stop 'em?</i>

499
00:53:02,994 --> 00:53:06,020
You wanna tell 'em
that you know what's best for 'em?

500
00:53:06,131 --> 00:53:09,157
Well, most people don't like
to be told what's best for 'em.

501
00:53:09,267 --> 00:53:13,135
Well, what's goin' on
at U.M.P. is unacceptable.

502
00:53:13,238 --> 00:53:15,832
And I'm gonna have
to tell Jack about all this.

503
00:53:17,943 --> 00:53:20,503
Oh. Gonna tell Jack, huh?

504
00:53:28,987 --> 00:53:31,820
I've been workin' for this company
almost 30 years.

505
00:53:31,923 --> 00:53:34,255
Hell, I grew up right down the street
from the Nathans...

506
00:53:34,359 --> 00:53:36,623
when we were all back in Muncie.

507
00:53:36,728 --> 00:53:41,097
So, here's my little piece
of friendly advice to you, Donny boy.

508
00:53:42,867 --> 00:53:46,359
I'd be careful
how close I got to Jack.

509
00:53:46,471 --> 00:53:49,497
<i>See, your boy Jack
is about this close...</i>

510
00:53:49,607 --> 00:53:51,905
to gettin' his tit
caught in the ringer.

511
00:53:52,010 --> 00:53:55,036
He's under investigation, okay?

512
00:53:55,146 --> 00:53:58,309
<i>Cookin' the books,
paddin' his expense account.</i>

513
00:53:58,416 --> 00:54:01,817
Not to mention
bonin' his own secretary, okay?

514
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:05,378
- And that is not the kind of
company that we want to run.
- Louise?

515
00:54:05,490 --> 00:54:07,390
That's right.

516
00:54:07,492 --> 00:54:11,690
Your buddy Jack's got two,
maybe three months before he's out the door.

517
00:54:11,796 --> 00:54:14,629
- Could be sooner.
- He's sleeping with Louise?

518
00:54:14,733 --> 00:54:16,633
And you know what, Don?

519
00:54:16,735 --> 00:54:19,397
You should be thankin' me
instead of doin' all this complainin'.

520
00:54:19,504 --> 00:54:22,803
<i>I negotiated a hell
of a good price with U.M.P.</i>

521
00:54:22,907 --> 00:54:26,900
Okay? I negotiated a great price
for your fuckin' meat.

522
00:54:27,012 --> 00:54:30,914
Hell, if it weren't for me,
there wouldn't be no Big One, Don.

523
00:54:31,016 --> 00:54:32,916
I'd like to see you find a supplier...

524
00:54:33,018 --> 00:54:35,418
that will sell you Grade "A" chuck
at 40 cents a pound.

525
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,784
I'd like to see that.

526
00:54:38,857 --> 00:54:41,382
Have-Have you ever met Louise?

527
00:54:41,493 --> 00:54:43,825
Have I ever met her?

528
00:54:43,928 --> 00:54:46,396
Twenty years ago,
I gave her that job.

529
00:54:46,498 --> 00:54:48,989
She was a good-lookin' woman
back then too.

530
00:54:53,938 --> 00:54:57,169
<i>It is a sad fact of life, Don.</i>

531
00:54:57,275 --> 00:54:59,835
But the truth is...

532
00:54:59,944 --> 00:55:02,708
we all have to eat a little shit
from time to time.

533
00:55:02,814 --> 00:55:06,045
But just for the record, I want you to know
that I'm with you on this.

534
00:55:06,151 --> 00:55:08,551
Okay? I really am.
I'm gonna go down there.

535
00:55:08,653 --> 00:55:10,553
I'm gonna see
what the hell's goin' on.

536
00:55:10,655 --> 00:55:12,555
If I have to,
I'm gonna kick some ass.

537
00:55:14,259 --> 00:55:16,227
You know what, Harry?

538
00:55:17,929 --> 00:55:19,897
I don't think
that's gonna be good enough.

539
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:25,463
You seem like
a real bright guy, Don.

540
00:55:25,570 --> 00:55:28,733
I'd hate to see you get caught up
in something you couldn't get out of.

541
00:55:30,041 --> 00:55:32,009
<i>Give it some thought.</i>

542
00:55:34,913 --> 00:55:37,108
Why don't you take
some of these fries home with you?

543
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:39,115
I'm not gonna finish 'em.

544
00:55:46,791 --> 00:55:50,420
No. No, it's not that simple.

545
00:55:52,230 --> 00:55:55,461
There is something definitely weird
going on between Jack and Harry...

546
00:55:55,567 --> 00:55:57,728
and, either way,
I can lose this job.

547
00:55:57,836 --> 00:55:59,736
Either way.

548
00:56:02,207 --> 00:56:06,075
No. No, we're not gonna move again.
That's-

549
00:56:06,177 --> 00:56:08,145
That's not gonna happen.

550
00:56:09,714 --> 00:56:11,773
Well, just tell Jay
to wait a moment.

551
00:56:11,883 --> 00:56:15,046
This is important.
Well, have him wait!

552
00:56:20,258 --> 00:56:22,522
Yeah.

553
00:56:22,627 --> 00:56:25,255
I'll- I'll talk to you later.

554
00:56:49,721 --> 00:56:52,713
No, no. Look, Jack, it's gone great.

555
00:56:52,824 --> 00:56:56,726
I, uh- I've been out to the plant.
I spoke to some workers.

556
00:56:56,828 --> 00:56:59,922
I even tracked down
this old rancher...

557
00:57:00,031 --> 00:57:01,999
who's dealt with these guys for years.

558
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:05,627
So, there's a lot of things, but-

559
00:57:05,737 --> 00:57:07,796
Yeah. No, of course
I met with Harry.

560
00:57:07,906 --> 00:57:11,774
Yeah. He's-He's a- interesting guy.
You were right.

561
00:57:11,876 --> 00:57:15,869
But I- I don't think that he's...
a crook.

562
00:57:17,882 --> 00:57:19,850
Well, I don't know.

563
00:57:22,353 --> 00:57:24,514
All right.

564
00:57:24,622 --> 00:57:27,557
Then, uh...

565
00:57:27,659 --> 00:57:29,889
I would probably recommend...

566
00:57:29,994 --> 00:57:33,088
we do some additional testing...

567
00:57:33,198 --> 00:57:35,894
in the near future.

568
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,991
See what that shows.

569
00:57:43,041 --> 00:57:45,669
Yeah.

570
00:57:45,777 --> 00:57:48,905
- Will you be keeping this
on your American Express?
- Sure.

571
00:57:49,013 --> 00:57:52,983
- I have three pay-per-view movies at 7.95 each.
- Uh-huh.

572
00:57:53,084 --> 00:57:56,019
- Would you like to join
our Executive Guest Advantage program?
- No.

573
00:57:56,120 --> 00:58:00,386
- Did you enjoy your stay with us?
- Not really.

574
00:58:00,491 --> 00:58:03,551
- Were you here on business or pleasure?
- Business.

575
00:58:03,661 --> 00:58:07,563
Is there anything we can do in the future
to make your stay with us more enjoyable?

576
00:58:07,665 --> 00:58:09,929
You can give me my bill.

577
00:58:12,036 --> 00:58:14,163
Bye-bye, Mr. Anderson.
Have a great day.

578
00:58:56,810 --> 00:58:58,903
- Thanks a lot.
- This looks good.

579
00:58:59,012 --> 00:59:02,812
Hi. Have you guys
decided on anything?

580
00:59:02,916 --> 00:59:06,249
Uh, two Chinese chicken salad,
please...

581
00:59:06,353 --> 00:59:08,821
<i>y two Coca-Colas, please.</i>

582
00:59:08,922 --> 00:59:11,049
Anything to start?

583
00:59:15,996 --> 00:59:19,022
Okay, uh, I'll be right back
with those Cokes.

584
00:59:19,132 --> 00:59:21,032
Oh.

585
00:59:22,269 --> 00:59:24,169
Thanks.

586
00:59:30,077 --> 00:59:31,977
Oh.

587
01:00:35,509 --> 01:00:38,478
- Hey.
- How was Roger?

588
01:00:38,578 --> 01:00:42,571
Roger is the "boringest" person I ever met.

589
01:00:42,683 --> 01:00:47,052
- Oh, sorry.
- What are you up to?

590
01:00:47,154 --> 01:00:51,853
- Um, I'm writing a biology paper.
- What's it about?

591
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:57,296
History of genetics.
I'm into all that sort of thing.

592
01:00:57,397 --> 01:00:59,297
When's it due?

593
01:00:59,399 --> 01:01:01,765
<i>- Tuesday.
- Next week?</i>

594
01:01:01,868 --> 01:01:05,634
Yeah, I just have a bunch of stuff
due before then.

595
01:01:05,739 --> 01:01:08,105
Where did you come from?

596
01:01:08,208 --> 01:01:10,642
<i>I was never this good.
And your father...</i>

597
01:01:10,744 --> 01:01:14,510
he was a lazy asshole.

598
01:01:14,614 --> 01:01:18,778
- Mom.
- What? He had other people
write his papers for him.

599
01:01:18,885 --> 01:01:21,285
- Hmm, I bet you were one of them.
- Mmm.

600
01:01:23,623 --> 01:01:26,490
- Hey.
- Screw you.

601
01:01:28,595 --> 01:01:31,223
We got a new shipment
of puppies today.

602
01:01:31,331 --> 01:01:33,595
I wanna take 'em all home.

603
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:35,998
Don't, Mom.

604
01:01:36,103 --> 01:01:39,869
Well, it's sad. Loretta said they just
make those cages big enough to be legal...

605
01:01:39,973 --> 01:01:43,670
but small enough so people
will get the puppies outta there.

606
01:01:43,777 --> 01:01:47,611
When I left the store tonight,
I just wanted to open all those cages...

607
01:01:47,714 --> 01:01:51,650
<i>- and let all those little puppies run free.
- Mom.</i>

608
01:01:51,752 --> 01:01:55,415
- They are so cute.
- Mom, I'm trying to work.

609
01:01:55,522 --> 01:01:59,151
<i>Okay, but you have to come
and see them tomorrow.</i>

610
01:02:07,134 --> 01:02:10,661
- Too slow, Amber. Too slow.
- Take it easy!

611
01:02:10,771 --> 01:02:14,207
Go to bed!

612
01:04:06,620 --> 01:04:09,384
<i>Hola. Hey, it's me.</i>

613
01:04:13,627 --> 01:04:15,527
<i>Call me. ¿Sí?</i>

614
01:04:21,001 --> 01:04:22,992
- I don't have a problem with it.
- Are you worried?

615
01:04:23,103 --> 01:04:25,867
- Uncle Pete!
- Hey!

616
01:04:25,972 --> 01:04:28,236
Oh, God!

617
01:04:28,341 --> 01:04:31,310
- What is with the uniforms?
- Sorry, Pete, we have jobs.

618
01:04:31,411 --> 01:04:33,311
Somebody put a blanket on her.

619
01:04:33,413 --> 01:04:35,313
Okay? All right?
I cannot believe...

620
01:04:35,415 --> 01:04:38,145
my beautiful Amber
is in a damn Mickeys uniform.

621
01:04:38,251 --> 01:04:41,652
- I can't look at you in that.
- That's what you wear when you have a real job.

622
01:04:41,755 --> 01:04:43,655
- You smell like chicken nuggets.
- She has a job!

623
01:04:43,757 --> 01:04:46,225
- Give me a break!
- All right. All right.

624
01:04:46,326 --> 01:04:48,817
- Well, except for the uniform. Let's see-
- You're dumb.

625
01:04:50,630 --> 01:04:53,531
- You look great. You do. You look fantastic.
- Thank you.

626
01:04:53,633 --> 01:04:55,828
- It's great to see you.
- Good to see you.

627
01:04:55,936 --> 01:04:57,904
- All right.
- How long are you here for?

628
01:04:58,004 --> 01:05:00,768
Just for the night. I'm on my way
up to Bozeman. No, don't-

629
01:05:00,874 --> 01:05:04,833
- I don't think I can talk to you in that thing.
- Leave her alone!

630
01:05:04,945 --> 01:05:07,539
- Honey, you got some homework?
- Oh, not much.

631
01:05:07,647 --> 01:05:09,512
Get it done, change your clothes
and go out with Uncle Pete.

632
01:05:09,616 --> 01:05:12,210
I have a date I can't break.
Had I known you were coming-

633
01:05:12,319 --> 01:05:15,618
- What, you would have changed your plans?
- No.

634
01:05:15,722 --> 01:05:19,351
- How's Gabe?
- He's great. He's walking and talking.

635
01:05:19,459 --> 01:05:23,122
<i>- Hey, how's Michelle?
- Mmm.</i>

636
01:05:23,230 --> 01:05:26,757
Is that Mrs. Whiskers?

637
01:05:26,866 --> 01:05:28,891
Check him out.
Check him out.

638
01:05:29,002 --> 01:05:31,698
- Oh, he's so big.
- Right?

639
01:05:31,805 --> 01:05:33,796
- Here.
- Hey!

640
01:05:33,940 --> 01:05:35,874
Thank you.

641
01:05:43,583 --> 01:05:45,813
- Man, this place is great.
- Mmm.

642
01:05:45,919 --> 01:05:48,410
Yeah, you are only allowed
to come here with me.

643
01:05:48,521 --> 01:05:50,421
So, are you on the pill?

644
01:05:52,025 --> 01:05:55,085
- Um, no.
- No? Do you have a boyfriend?

645
01:05:55,195 --> 01:05:58,824
- Not really. I'm kinda in between.
- Mm-hmm.

646
01:05:58,932 --> 01:06:00,991
Well, they are circling you like sharks.

647
01:06:01,101 --> 01:06:03,592
Right? I'm gonna come back here
and find that you got, like...

648
01:06:03,703 --> 01:06:06,501
- a little baby fry cook in the oven.
- You know what?

649
01:06:06,606 --> 01:06:09,803
- What?
- I remember you taking me
to Mickeys when I was a kid.

650
01:06:09,909 --> 01:06:11,467
- No, did I?
- Yes.

651
01:06:11,578 --> 01:06:14,741
I was being lazy. I apologize.
Now I hate everything about the place.

652
01:06:16,483 --> 01:06:19,111
Mom said it was a big deal
when the first Mickeys opened here.

653
01:06:19,219 --> 01:06:21,244
It was tremendous.

654
01:06:21,354 --> 01:06:24,846
It was. I mean, you know-
Cody was on the map.

655
01:06:24,958 --> 01:06:27,756
The-The first one didn't bother me.
It was just the 400th...

656
01:06:27,861 --> 01:06:30,591
that started to, you know,
get under my skin.

657
01:06:32,198 --> 01:06:34,792
- Well, I need the money. I really do.
- Yeah?

658
01:06:34,901 --> 01:06:38,837
There's no other jobs here, right?
You tried A.S.P.C.A. You tried the park services.

659
01:06:38,938 --> 01:06:42,101
You tried day care. Nobody around here
needs their kids to be taken care of?

660
01:06:44,411 --> 01:06:46,936
- It was the first job I could find.
- Mm-hmm.

661
01:06:47,047 --> 01:06:50,016
I mean, a friend of mine worked there.
What do you want to hear?

662
01:06:50,116 --> 01:06:54,109
I'm not criticizing you, all right?
I think you are great.

663
01:06:54,220 --> 01:06:58,213
I just wanna know your timeline
for gettin' outta here.

664
01:06:58,325 --> 01:07:00,293
- I wanna go to college.
- Good.

665
01:07:00,393 --> 01:07:03,760
I'm thinking Oregon or Montana.

666
01:07:03,863 --> 01:07:06,354
- What ya gonna study?
- I don't know.

667
01:07:06,466 --> 01:07:09,060
I wanna- I wanna write.

668
01:07:09,169 --> 01:07:11,535
<i>I like photography.</i>

669
01:07:11,638 --> 01:07:14,539
<i>But I think I wanna study science, so-</i>

670
01:07:14,641 --> 01:07:16,541
aeronautical engineering.

671
01:07:16,643 --> 01:07:18,634
- Aeronautical engineering?
- Yeah.

672
01:07:18,745 --> 01:07:21,077
I mean, if I could do
anything in the world...

673
01:07:21,181 --> 01:07:23,809
I'd be an astronaut.

674
01:07:23,917 --> 01:07:27,182
- All right, well, fucking-A, do it.
- Okay.

675
01:07:27,287 --> 01:07:30,313
<i>But you need
to get outta here to do that.</i>

676
01:07:30,423 --> 01:07:32,687
Was it hard leaving Cody
back when you were a teenager?

677
01:07:32,792 --> 01:07:36,489
No, not for me. Your mom, though,
that was a different story.

678
01:07:36,596 --> 01:07:39,258
<i>I was on the way.
Kinda cuts down on your options.</i>

679
01:07:39,366 --> 01:07:43,928
Mm-hmm. That is why,
if, by the age of 21...

680
01:07:44,037 --> 01:07:46,904
you have not missed
one menstrual cycle...

681
01:07:47,006 --> 01:07:52,034
- I will give you $1,000.
- Will you shut up? Okay?

682
01:07:52,145 --> 01:07:56,411
- I am not talking to my uncle about sex.
- Okay.

683
01:07:56,516 --> 01:07:58,711
I read this study
the other day about, uh...

684
01:07:58,818 --> 01:08:01,184
people who are happiest
with their lives.

685
01:08:01,287 --> 01:08:03,847
And, uh, the ones who have
followed their passion, right...

686
01:08:03,957 --> 01:08:06,755
even if they weren't, you know,
technically successful, right?

687
01:08:06,860 --> 01:08:10,159
When they were looking back
at their life, they had fewer regrets.

688
01:08:10,263 --> 01:08:13,460
You know, they felt their life
had been more fulfilling.

689
01:08:13,566 --> 01:08:16,933
- Yeah, that makes sense, I guess.
- Yeah, it does.

690
01:08:17,036 --> 01:08:20,938
So, bottom line is, do not listen to me.
Do not listen to your mother.

691
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:23,770
Listen to yourself.

692
01:08:23,877 --> 01:08:25,902
I mean, if you wanna be
like everybody else...

693
01:08:26,012 --> 01:08:27,912
just do what everybody's
telling you to do.

694
01:08:28,014 --> 01:08:29,914
Hmm.

695
01:08:31,418 --> 01:08:35,252
And what about you? Are you doing
what you always wanted to do?

696
01:08:36,823 --> 01:08:40,953
Well, if I jump back
to when I was your age-

697
01:08:41,060 --> 01:08:43,585
No, I don't think
I would be wildly impressed.

698
01:08:43,696 --> 01:08:45,596
All right? I don't- I-

699
01:08:45,698 --> 01:08:50,328
But, you know, I'm all right
with what I'm doing.

700
01:08:50,437 --> 01:08:53,338
<i>And, you know, I'm really all right
with what I'm not doing.</i>

701
01:08:56,543 --> 01:08:58,477
- Is that your move?
- Yeah.

702
01:08:58,578 --> 01:09:00,569
- Thuh-bop!
- Dang it.

703
01:09:00,680 --> 01:09:02,580
Yep. So-

704
01:09:02,682 --> 01:09:04,650
Hello.

705
01:09:04,751 --> 01:09:08,585
- Amber, why are you still up?
- Well, why do you have my poncho on?

706
01:09:08,688 --> 01:09:11,350
- It's fine.
- How was it, hmm?

707
01:09:11,458 --> 01:09:14,757
- Well, she's home fairly early,
if that signifies anything.

708
01:09:14,861 --> 01:09:18,695
<i>Oh, no, no, no. That doesn't mean anything.
Your mother-She's amazing.</i>

709
01:09:18,798 --> 01:09:21,790
You wouldn't believe what she could
get accomplished in a short period of time.

710
01:09:21,901 --> 01:09:23,698
Screw you both.

711
01:09:23,803 --> 01:09:27,034
Hey, Sis. Sis-Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey.

712
01:09:27,140 --> 01:09:30,769
So, what would you say?
Is Cody a better town today...

713
01:09:30,877 --> 01:09:33,846
<i>- or back when we were kids?
- Well, I know what you would say.</i>

714
01:09:33,947 --> 01:09:36,313
<i>- What?
- Your uncle hates everything, Amber.</i>

715
01:09:36,416 --> 01:09:39,715
<i>You know, I actually think it's better now.
There's more stuff to do.</i>

716
01:09:39,819 --> 01:09:44,256
<i>Oh, yeah. There's more to do. You got
the Wal-Mart, the Kmart and the Target, right?</i>

717
01:09:44,357 --> 01:09:46,552
You got Chuck E. Cheese.
You got Taco Bell.

718
01:09:46,659 --> 01:09:49,685
<i>You got Arby's.
You got Mickeys. You got Denny's.</i>

719
01:09:49,796 --> 01:09:51,855
<i>You've got, uh, Chili's.</i>

720
01:09:51,965 --> 01:09:55,128
<i>You got Applebee's. You got Wendy's.
You got Hardee's, right?</i>

721
01:09:55,235 --> 01:09:57,135
<i>You got the- the K.F.C., the IHOP.</i>

722
01:09:57,237 --> 01:09:59,865
- Do they still have
that Der Wienerschnitzel?

723
01:09:59,973 --> 01:10:02,806
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, thank God it's still hanging in there.

724
01:10:02,909 --> 01:10:05,605
I don't know about you,
but I could just piss away...

725
01:10:05,712 --> 01:10:07,680
a whole Sunday afternoon
at the Sunglass Hut.

726
01:10:07,780 --> 01:10:09,805
<i>- You know?
- Have you ever been to the Sunglass Hut?</i>

727
01:10:09,916 --> 01:10:13,249
<i>No, I never have. I'm not trying to come off
like some Polly Perfect here.</i>

728
01:10:13,353 --> 01:10:15,253
I'm going to make some cabinets...

729
01:10:15,355 --> 01:10:17,687
for some rich
New York investment banker fuck...

730
01:10:17,790 --> 01:10:22,056
who probably spends two weeks a year
at his Montana ranch, so don't listen to me.

731
01:10:22,161 --> 01:10:25,221
- I'm not.
- I'm not talking to you.
I'm talking to your daughter.

732
01:10:25,331 --> 01:10:28,357
I'm probably just going through some
full-of-shit, early middle-age period.

733
01:10:28,468 --> 01:10:30,663
I don't think you're full of shit.

734
01:10:30,770 --> 01:10:33,933
Thank you. She's so nice.
What happened to you?

735
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:37,601
<i>No, no, sweetheart, don't contradict your mother.
He is full of shit.</i>

736
01:10:37,710 --> 01:10:40,178
I don't waste a lot of time
thinking about this stuff.

737
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:42,578
Democrats, Republicans-

738
01:10:42,682 --> 01:10:45,810
- They're all crooks.
- This is why revolutions are meant for the young.

739
01:10:45,919 --> 01:10:47,819
If you don't do it now,
you're never gonna.

740
01:10:47,921 --> 01:10:50,822
Uniform- uniformity.
Conform- conformity.

741
01:10:50,924 --> 01:10:52,858
Monogamy- monotony.

742
01:10:52,959 --> 01:10:54,756
No wonder you're not still married.

743
01:10:54,861 --> 01:10:58,558
- Stupid- stupidity.
- Yeah, look- Hey, the facts are not always friendly.

744
01:10:58,665 --> 01:11:00,690
Listen to who's giving
the lecture here, Amber.

745
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:02,700
Your uncle did not finish college.

746
01:11:02,802 --> 01:11:05,430
- Jesus! Mm-hmm. Oh!
- Okay?

747
01:11:05,538 --> 01:11:10,100
- He lived in a camper for 18 months.
- An Airstream!

748
01:11:10,209 --> 01:11:12,177
This is not a role model.

749
01:11:12,278 --> 01:11:14,269
Remind me to deprogram you
after he leaves.

750
01:11:14,380 --> 01:11:16,644
Hey, Mom said you got
kicked out of college.

751
01:11:16,749 --> 01:11:20,913
- Oh, well, thanks, Mom.
- Yeah, your mug shots are in all the papers.

752
01:11:21,020 --> 01:11:25,218
Yeah, with eight others. I was at
Colorado University. We were the C.U. Nine.

753
01:11:25,325 --> 01:11:30,524
<i>Yeah, that notorious band
of Midwestern, white freedom fighters.</i>

754
01:11:30,630 --> 01:11:32,928
No, no, no.
We took over the chancellor's office.

755
01:11:33,032 --> 01:11:36,126
<i>All right, we were protesting
the college's investment in South Africa.</i>

756
01:11:36,235 --> 01:11:39,329
<i>- So what happened?
- All right, well, so, after about four hours...</i>

757
01:11:39,439 --> 01:11:42,237
- they come bursting through this barricade-
- Okay, that was two chalkboards.

758
01:11:42,342 --> 01:11:44,242
- It's not two chalkboards.
- It was too.

759
01:11:44,344 --> 01:11:47,108
We had rope with some chair-
They practically beat the shit out of all of us.

760
01:11:47,213 --> 01:11:49,113
They treated us
like a band of terrorists.

761
01:11:49,215 --> 01:11:51,115
You got your little ass
kicked out of college...

762
01:11:51,217 --> 01:11:53,117
- which he never finished.
- Big deal.

763
01:11:53,219 --> 01:11:56,188
- It cost our dad $2,000 in legal fees.
- I eventually paid him back.

764
01:11:56,289 --> 01:11:58,314
Anyway, meanwhile-
Cut to-

765
01:11:58,424 --> 01:12:01,757
About a year later, the college divests
all its holdings in South Africa...

766
01:12:01,861 --> 01:12:04,796
and a little while after that,
Nelson Mandela is a free man.

767
01:12:04,897 --> 01:12:09,300
- All because of the "C.U. Nine."
- No, nobody said that. Nobody even thought that.

768
01:12:09,402 --> 01:12:12,838
The point is... that, you know,
if enough people...

769
01:12:12,939 --> 01:12:15,669
start thinking about something
and trying to actually do something...

770
01:12:15,775 --> 01:12:17,675
you can change things
for the better.

771
01:12:17,777 --> 01:12:20,211
I believe that.

772
01:12:20,313 --> 01:12:22,645
- I hope they can change for the better.
- Don't just hope.

773
01:12:22,749 --> 01:12:24,944
You can't sit back and hope.
You have to do something.

774
01:12:25,051 --> 01:12:26,951
In a town like this,
hope will kill you.

775
01:12:27,987 --> 01:12:29,887
It's your move.

776
01:12:35,261 --> 01:12:37,126
¡Rápido!

777
01:12:38,164 --> 01:12:40,132
¡Rápido!

778
01:13:00,019 --> 01:13:01,680
¡Rápido!

779
01:13:17,303 --> 01:13:20,272
Eh.

780
01:13:45,131 --> 01:13:47,258
Ah?

781
01:14:37,884 --> 01:14:40,182
Hey, hey.
You fucking crazy, huh?

782
01:14:58,371 --> 01:15:02,102
Everybody else, stop fucking smiling
and get back to work!

783
01:15:05,244 --> 01:15:07,769
Coco.

784
01:15:30,403 --> 01:15:33,133
Coco. Coco.

785
01:15:43,583 --> 01:15:45,483
<i>Is she okay?</i>

786
01:15:45,585 --> 01:15:47,416
She needs to start sleeping
at night.

787
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:49,420
So do you.

788
01:15:49,522 --> 01:15:51,717
How's Stan's back doing?

789
01:15:51,824 --> 01:15:54,657
<i>He complains about it
all the time, but he's fine.</i>

790
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:56,694
Say hello for me.

791
01:15:56,796 --> 01:16:00,357
As for this little lady, she got about an hour
left on her shift, so-

792
01:16:00,466 --> 01:16:04,493
- She'll make it.
- All right. Let's go.

793
01:16:04,604 --> 01:16:06,504
<i>Ándale.</i>

794
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:09,940
Hey.

795
01:16:10,042 --> 01:16:12,670
You've been a bad girl.

796
01:16:22,521 --> 01:16:23,545
Chill out, okay?

797
01:16:26,192 --> 01:16:28,854
Touch her again...

798
01:16:28,961 --> 01:16:31,589
and I'll kill you, hmm?

799
01:16:31,697 --> 01:16:33,858
I mean it.

800
01:16:53,019 --> 01:16:53,986
No?

801
01:17:00,059 --> 01:17:00,525
Uh-huh.

802
01:17:03,629 --> 01:17:06,757
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

803
01:17:07,967 --> 01:17:09,867
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
- Hmm?

804
01:17:17,777 --> 01:17:19,642
Think about it.

805
01:17:19,745 --> 01:17:22,145
All that surveillance equipment
they have here?

806
01:17:22,248 --> 01:17:24,808
They say it's for our safety...

807
01:17:24,917 --> 01:17:27,818
<i>but those cameras
are pointed right at us-</i>

808
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:32,653
monitoring us, making sure
we don't steal shit and stuff.

809
01:17:32,758 --> 01:17:36,922
Yeah, you know, I always wonder
whose job it is to watch those monitors...

810
01:17:37,029 --> 01:17:39,190
'cause you don't see anyone
around here doing that.

811
01:17:39,298 --> 01:17:43,598
I think they just record everything
in case somethin' happens.

812
01:17:45,137 --> 01:17:48,197
It's probably all getting fed back
to the national headquarters.

813
01:17:48,307 --> 01:17:50,639
Yeah, like our cash registers.

814
01:17:52,745 --> 01:17:55,373
What about 'em?

815
01:17:55,481 --> 01:17:58,143
- You don't know about that?
- Uh-uh.

816
01:17:58,250 --> 01:18:00,150
Oh, man. Okay.

817
01:18:00,252 --> 01:18:04,120
First thing I do whenever I start my shift
is type in the last four digits...

818
01:18:04,223 --> 01:18:06,350
of my Social Security number,
then log in.

819
01:18:06,459 --> 01:18:10,828
- Mm-hmm.
- And from then on,
they keep track of every keystroke.

820
01:18:10,930 --> 01:18:13,990
- Really?
- Yeah, they keep a record.

821
01:18:14,100 --> 01:18:18,230
They know exactly how many orders of fries
I've sold this month- everything.

822
01:18:18,337 --> 01:18:21,636
And I even have to put in a little code
with each person's order...

823
01:18:21,741 --> 01:18:23,732
saying their approximate age
and ethnicity.

824
01:18:23,843 --> 01:18:25,834
They don't even know.

825
01:18:25,945 --> 01:18:27,845
You know, that is fuckin' evil.

826
01:18:27,947 --> 01:18:31,508
Well-

827
01:18:31,617 --> 01:18:33,517
That's Mickeys for you.

828
01:18:47,833 --> 01:18:50,961
Man, when we came here,
we sat right over there.

829
01:18:51,070 --> 01:18:55,769
- Was it, like, full?
- Yeah, it was really full.
There was this band that played.

830
01:18:55,875 --> 01:18:57,775
<i>- They were pretty good.
- Yeah, hey, look, just ask.</i>

831
01:18:57,877 --> 01:18:59,777
- Mm-hmm.
- Don't worry about it.

832
01:18:59,879 --> 01:19:02,006
- All right. Got it.
- Casual. Nothin'-

833
01:19:03,416 --> 01:19:06,044
- Hi!
- Hey.

834
01:19:06,152 --> 01:19:09,053
- Were you here the other night?
- Yeah.

835
01:19:09,155 --> 01:19:11,851
- Who was that guy that was with you?
- Uh, my uncle?

836
01:19:11,957 --> 01:19:14,323
Oh, my God.

837
01:19:14,427 --> 01:19:16,827
We were trying
to figure that one out.

838
01:19:16,929 --> 01:19:19,591
He's hot, okay?

839
01:19:19,698 --> 01:19:21,666
No, he's my uncle.

840
01:19:21,767 --> 01:19:23,962
I'm Andrew. This is Alice.

841
01:19:24,070 --> 01:19:25,298
- I'm Amber.
- Kim.

842
01:19:25,404 --> 01:19:27,304
- Kim? Nice to meet you.
- Hey.

843
01:19:27,406 --> 01:19:30,807
We're all heading over to the lookout
for a party, if you guys wanna come.

844
01:19:30,910 --> 01:19:32,810
- The lookout?
- Mm-hmm.

845
01:19:32,912 --> 01:19:35,904
That road behind campus-Take that up
Mount Cody a mile, and it's right there.

846
01:19:36,015 --> 01:19:38,609
- Oh, right. Yeah.
- Should be fun.

847
01:19:38,717 --> 01:19:40,548
- Maybe we'll see you then.
- Make it out there.

848
01:19:40,653 --> 01:19:42,587
- Okay, see you there.
- All right.

849
01:19:42,755 --> 01:19:44,882
Hey!

850
01:19:50,996 --> 01:19:54,261
<i>'Cause there is no way you
can make sense of it all on your own.</i>

851
01:19:54,366 --> 01:19:57,597
The lies are too big.
They're too ingenious.

852
01:19:57,703 --> 01:19:59,603
They're too interconnected
with one another.

853
01:19:59,705 --> 01:20:03,664
<i>And they know, if the lies are repeated
over and over and over again...</i>

854
01:20:03,776 --> 01:20:06,904
people are finally gonna
have to believe it, and we do.

855
01:20:07,012 --> 01:20:10,345
<i>Yeah. Like, have you guys read that book
Crimes Against Nature?</i>

856
01:20:10,449 --> 01:20:12,917
<i>- Title says it all.
- Exactly.</i>

857
01:20:13,018 --> 01:20:14,918
- Read that book.
- It's talking about how right now...

858
01:20:15,020 --> 01:20:17,648
they've got the logging companies
and the timber companies...

859
01:20:17,756 --> 01:20:20,190
chopping down all the trees
in the national forest...

860
01:20:20,292 --> 01:20:22,260
but they're saying
it's the "healthy forest" program.

861
01:20:22,361 --> 01:20:27,458
Yep, and they got the coal companies
running our clean-air plan.

862
01:20:27,566 --> 01:20:30,126
How do they announce that stuff in public
without cracking up?

863
01:20:30,236 --> 01:20:32,500
I gotta hand it to them though-

864
01:20:32,605 --> 01:20:34,505
genius fucking marketers.

865
01:20:34,607 --> 01:20:37,132
And they're extremely well organized,
so we need to be too.

866
01:20:37,243 --> 01:20:39,837
<i>- Amber!
- Yeah, and these guys see themselves...</i>

867
01:20:39,945 --> 01:20:42,175
- as big-time, righteous Christians.
- Come here.

868
01:20:42,281 --> 01:20:44,511
What would Jesus do?

869
01:20:44,617 --> 01:20:48,212
- Hey, what's going on?
- I met these really cute guys.
They want to meet you.

870
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:53,087
Well- I'm hanging out
with these guys.

871
01:20:53,192 --> 01:20:56,958
- They're so boring.
- I don't wanna leave just yet.

872
01:20:57,062 --> 01:21:01,863
- Why?
- I don't know-

873
01:21:01,967 --> 01:21:04,527
Don't worry about it.
I'll catch up with you later.

874
01:21:18,117 --> 01:21:20,950
- Hey, Brian.
- Hey. What are you doing here?

875
01:21:23,989 --> 01:21:26,890
- Tony?
- Hey, Amber.

876
01:21:27,993 --> 01:21:32,362
- Uh, Tony-
- Yeah.

877
01:21:34,767 --> 01:21:37,827
- I don't think I can work here anymore.
- Everything okay?

878
01:21:37,937 --> 01:21:39,837
You okay?

879
01:21:41,340 --> 01:21:43,240
I'm fine.

880
01:21:43,342 --> 01:21:45,139
I mean, what do you want to do?

881
01:21:45,244 --> 01:21:48,509
You wanna cut back on the hours?
Maybe try another shift?

882
01:21:48,614 --> 01:21:52,209
No.

883
01:21:52,318 --> 01:21:54,786
Something happen?
Anybody giving you a hard time?

884
01:21:56,355 --> 01:21:59,290
- No.
- What's up?

885
01:21:59,391 --> 01:22:01,882
Talk to me.

886
01:22:01,994 --> 01:22:05,862
I just- I can't work here anymore.

887
01:22:05,965 --> 01:22:08,957
<i>- It feels wrong.
- How is it wrong?</i>

888
01:22:09,068 --> 01:22:12,037
- The job sucks, but that doesn't mean it's wrong.
- Brian.

889
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:18,640
Listen, Amber,
you're one of my best associates, okay?

890
01:22:18,744 --> 01:22:21,975
We're starting to talk about you-
management material.

891
01:22:22,081 --> 01:22:25,209
Okay? You're about
to turn 18 pretty soon.

892
01:22:25,317 --> 01:22:28,753
We're expanding. We got a lot
of opportunities here. Think about this.

893
01:22:31,090 --> 01:22:32,990
I just want to do something else.

894
01:22:35,961 --> 01:22:38,429
Okay. There something wrong
with this place?

895
01:22:40,733 --> 01:22:43,600
It kinda doesn't feel real.

896
01:22:43,702 --> 01:22:46,000
I mean- It's not your fault.

897
01:22:46,105 --> 01:22:48,835
It's just-This place is like
a thousand other places.

898
01:22:48,941 --> 01:22:51,239
- They're all- It's identical.
- All right.

899
01:22:51,343 --> 01:22:53,573
Okay, you want reality,
you got it. Good-bye.

900
01:22:53,679 --> 01:22:55,772
Tony, I'm sorry.

901
01:22:55,881 --> 01:22:58,213
This has nothing to do with you.

902
01:22:58,317 --> 01:23:00,979
I'm really disappointed, Amber.

903
01:23:01,086 --> 01:23:04,021
- Really disappointed.
- Me too.

904
01:23:05,124 --> 01:23:07,092
I'm... sorry.

905
01:23:09,194 --> 01:23:11,662
<i>You can pick up your check next Thursday.</i>

906
01:23:11,764 --> 01:23:13,789
Do you want a Coffee Freezer
for the road?

907
01:23:15,034 --> 01:23:16,934
Okay.

908
01:23:39,291 --> 01:23:41,191
<i>¡Francisco!</i>

909
01:23:48,934 --> 01:23:51,459
<i>¡Rápido!</i>

910
01:23:55,974 --> 01:23:57,965
<i>¡Raul!</i>

911
01:23:58,077 --> 01:24:01,069
<i>¿Hombre, qué paso?</i>

912
01:24:01,180 --> 01:24:03,705
Okay.

913
01:24:13,025 --> 01:24:14,253
Sylvia!

914
01:24:25,165 --> 01:24:28,498
Ah, Sylvia.

915
01:24:28,602 --> 01:24:31,070
I'm Tom Watson, Human Resources.

916
01:24:38,378 --> 01:24:41,279
<i>- ¿Como está?
- How is he?</i>

917
01:24:41,381 --> 01:24:45,181
Oh, well, he's got a few cracked ribs,
a pretty bad concussion...

918
01:24:45,285 --> 01:24:47,810
and he has a disk
in his lower back that's hurt.

919
01:24:47,921 --> 01:24:50,185
But that could have been a problem
before the accident.

920
01:25:05,372 --> 01:25:08,705
She says,
"If he's going to be all right?"

921
01:25:08,809 --> 01:25:11,300
He's gonna be real sore,
but he's gonna be okay.

922
01:25:15,549 --> 01:25:20,953
Look, I want you to tell her I have
some unpleasant news that we need to discuss.

923
01:25:28,028 --> 01:25:31,691
Raul tested positive
for methamphetamine.

924
01:25:43,243 --> 01:25:47,009
<i>It's an illegal drug.
It appears he was using drugs on the job.</i>

925
01:25:47,114 --> 01:25:50,606
And this could have caused the accident.

926
01:25:55,722 --> 01:25:57,622
<i>She says she doesn't believe you.</i>

927
01:25:57,724 --> 01:25:59,624
Well, tell her this.

928
01:25:59,726 --> 01:26:02,160
Tell her that U.M.P. is committed
to a drug-free workplace.

929
01:26:02,262 --> 01:26:04,924
And, if you break the rules,
it endangers others. Tell her that.

930
01:26:12,839 --> 01:26:15,205
<i>She says Raul has never used any drugs.</i>

931
01:26:15,308 --> 01:26:18,072
Well, look, I can show her
the result of the blood test.

932
01:26:20,747 --> 01:26:23,443
<i>She doesn't believe us.</i>

933
01:26:26,319 --> 01:26:28,219
I'm sorry about your husband.

934
01:27:30,483 --> 01:27:34,351
Problem is, at this very moment,
there's about a hundred thousand cattle...

935
01:27:34,454 --> 01:27:37,287
in the U.M.P. feedlot
that's right outside of Cody.

936
01:27:37,390 --> 01:27:41,121
It's one of the biggest feedlots in the world.
Each one of those cows...

937
01:27:41,228 --> 01:27:43,662
puts out 50 pounds
of piss and shit every day.

938
01:27:43,763 --> 01:27:45,697
<i>- Fifty pounds each.
- Lovely.</i>

939
01:27:45,799 --> 01:27:48,768
<i>Yeah, I know.
So, that U.M.P. feedlot...</i>

940
01:27:48,868 --> 01:27:51,302
produces more waste
every single day...

941
01:27:51,404 --> 01:27:54,100
than all of the people
in Denver combined.

942
01:27:54,207 --> 01:27:56,141
<i>- That's gross.
- Yeah.</i>

943
01:27:56,243 --> 01:27:58,609
And-And the waste
from U.M.P.'s feedlot, it's-it's-

944
01:27:58,712 --> 01:28:01,579
It's not going to some
high-tech treatment plant, you know?

945
01:28:01,681 --> 01:28:03,581
It's being pumped
into these lagoons...

946
01:28:03,683 --> 01:28:07,141
which are these just great big ponds
of piss and shit.

947
01:28:07,254 --> 01:28:11,281
And these great big shit ponds
are leaking shit into Peyton Creek...

948
01:28:11,391 --> 01:28:13,291
which eventually ends up
in the river.

949
01:28:13,393 --> 01:28:17,159
<i>I mean, you should see it. U.M.P. 's cattle,
they're all just crammed together...</i>

950
01:28:17,264 --> 01:28:20,631
living in their own manure,
eating this genetically engineered crap...

951
01:28:20,734 --> 01:28:23,965
<i>that's being dumped into
these concrete troughs for them.</i>

952
01:28:24,070 --> 01:28:26,265
It's like prison camps for cows.

953
01:28:26,373 --> 01:28:29,968
<i>You wouldn't believe it.
You can smell it, like, three miles away.</i>

954
01:28:30,076 --> 01:28:34,137
So Professor Cohen is gonna help us
coordinate a letter-writing campaign...

955
01:28:34,247 --> 01:28:36,408
<i>not only
to the state water quality board...</i>

956
01:28:36,516 --> 01:28:40,008
- but to various editorial organizations-
- Are you kidding me?

957
01:28:40,120 --> 01:28:41,849
Excuse me?

958
01:28:41,955 --> 01:28:45,152
You guys are gonna write a letter.

959
01:28:45,258 --> 01:28:48,318
That company is the meanest
fucking company I've ever seen.

960
01:28:48,428 --> 01:28:52,194
They treat their workers like shit.
They treat the animals like shit.

961
01:28:52,299 --> 01:28:54,893
<i>They're dumping tons of shit
and piss into our river...</i>

962
01:28:55,001 --> 01:28:57,526
- and you guys are gonna write a letter?
- Yes, Paco...

963
01:28:57,637 --> 01:29:00,834
as an official warning, to be followed
by a campus-wide boycott...

964
01:29:00,940 --> 01:29:03,170
<i>of everything that comes
out of that place.</i>

965
01:29:03,276 --> 01:29:07,269
The governor got $200,000
from U.M.P. last year.

966
01:29:07,380 --> 01:29:09,644
Cathy Crawford?

967
01:29:09,749 --> 01:29:13,480
Head of the environmental committee
in the state senate?

968
01:29:13,586 --> 01:29:16,578
She's married to a U.M.P. top exec.

969
01:29:16,690 --> 01:29:19,716
And you guys are gonna
write a letter.

970
01:29:19,826 --> 01:29:21,987
What a fucking waste of time.

971
01:29:22,095 --> 01:29:25,963
Listen, you have gotta start somewhere
in raising awareness-

972
01:29:26,066 --> 01:29:29,126
No, this is bullshit-
this environmental policy discussion group.

973
01:29:29,235 --> 01:29:32,204
Even our name sucks.

974
01:29:32,305 --> 01:29:35,240
Did you just make this up so you could put it
on your grad school applications, Andrew?

975
01:29:35,342 --> 01:29:37,606
Do you have a better idea, Gerald?

976
01:29:37,711 --> 01:29:40,703
- Excuse me, I'm- I'm sorry, "Paco"?
- Fuck you, man.

977
01:29:40,814 --> 01:29:43,442
<i>Are you just here
to be the self-righteous critic, man?</i>

978
01:29:43,550 --> 01:29:48,385
I don't know, man.
Action speaks louder.

979
01:29:48,488 --> 01:29:50,786
I'm tired of nice people sitting around
talking and complaining...

980
01:29:50,890 --> 01:29:53,051
while the bad guys get to do
whatever the fuck they want.

981
01:29:53,159 --> 01:29:57,493
- I wanna see some action.
- We all do, dude. That's what we're doing here.

982
01:29:57,597 --> 01:29:59,827
Those Greenpeace dudes,
they put their asses on the line.

983
01:29:59,933 --> 01:30:03,494
That's exactly what we should do.

984
01:30:03,603 --> 01:30:07,369
You said that there's, like,
a hundred thousand cows, right?

985
01:30:07,474 --> 01:30:09,499
<i>- Uh, roughly.
- Well...</i>

986
01:30:09,609 --> 01:30:12,043
what if we cut the fence...

987
01:30:13,279 --> 01:30:16,737
<i>and let them out?</i>

988
01:30:16,850 --> 01:30:19,512
Let them run free.
I mean, that-

989
01:30:19,619 --> 01:30:21,519
That might get some attention.

990
01:30:21,621 --> 01:30:25,887
See? That's the kind of shit I'm talking about.
What's your name?

991
01:30:25,992 --> 01:30:29,086
- Amber.
- Beautiful, Amber.

992
01:30:30,730 --> 01:30:32,857
Well, think about it.

993
01:30:32,966 --> 01:30:37,960
<i>I mean, if you suddenly had thousands
and thousands of cows...</i>

994
01:30:38,071 --> 01:30:40,062
you know, wandering free...

995
01:30:40,173 --> 01:30:42,300
wandering back to the prairie
where they belong...

996
01:30:42,409 --> 01:30:46,072
causing traffic jams,
blocking the highway...

997
01:30:46,179 --> 01:30:49,876
you're reminding people that cows aren't
supposed to be penned up and treated that way.

998
01:30:49,983 --> 01:30:52,975
You know, that's a really good idea.

999
01:30:53,086 --> 01:30:56,453
Because then we could issue
a press release with our demands...

1000
01:30:56,556 --> 01:31:00,083
showing what a disaster that company is
and what we're gonna do next.

1001
01:31:00,193 --> 01:31:02,286
We-We can do all this.

1002
01:31:02,395 --> 01:31:05,796
<i>I'm just- I'm warning you guys
that right now in this country...</i>

1003
01:31:05,899 --> 01:31:08,163
any destruction of private property
along these lines...

1004
01:31:08,268 --> 01:31:10,566
can be considered
in violation of the Patriot Act.

1005
01:31:10,670 --> 01:31:13,138
It can be considered
an act of terrorism.

1006
01:31:13,239 --> 01:31:15,434
You can go to prison
for, like, 10 years.

1007
01:31:15,542 --> 01:31:17,908
<i>- Yeah, it's a bunch of bullshit.
- I know.</i>

1008
01:31:18,011 --> 01:31:20,275
I know. We have entered
a whole new era...

1009
01:31:20,380 --> 01:31:22,780
where they can search your house
without a warrant.

1010
01:31:22,882 --> 01:31:25,282
They can put you in jail
without a trial.

1011
01:31:25,385 --> 01:31:28,616
Eco-activists that have
never harmed another human being...

1012
01:31:28,721 --> 01:31:33,055
are considered by our government to be
more of a threat to national security...

1013
01:31:33,159 --> 01:31:36,822
than all these right-wing,
Timothy McVeigh, militia types.

1014
01:31:38,932 --> 01:31:41,730
Well, right now I can't think
of anything more patriotic...

1015
01:31:41,835 --> 01:31:43,928
than violating the Patriot Act.

1016
01:32:30,183 --> 01:32:32,083
Hmm?

1017
01:33:47,427 --> 01:33:49,327
This industry's fucked.

1018
01:33:49,429 --> 01:33:52,159
There's rumors U.M.P.'s plannin'
to sell the plant or shut us down.

1019
01:33:53,633 --> 01:33:57,194
They got plants all over the U.S.,
fuckin' Canada.

1020
01:33:57,303 --> 01:34:00,238
Cody plant don't start pulling its weight,
yeah, they'll shut us down.

1021
01:34:00,340 --> 01:34:03,002
Don't matter we've been here
35 fuckin' years.

1022
01:34:03,109 --> 01:34:07,273
Don't give a fuck about Cody, and they
sure as shit don't give a fuck about me.

1023
01:34:58,064 --> 01:35:00,999
Jesus, fuck.
This is taking forever, man.

1024
01:35:01,100 --> 01:35:03,694
Always cut fences.

1025
01:35:03,803 --> 01:35:06,067
It's the golden rule.

1026
01:35:06,172 --> 01:35:08,140
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1027
01:35:08,241 --> 01:35:10,732
- Come on, buddies.
- Come on, babies. Run for it.

1028
01:35:10,843 --> 01:35:13,539
<i>- Let's go!
- Watch you don't step in the shit.</i>

1029
01:35:13,646 --> 01:35:16,410
<i>- Come on, babies. Run for it!
- Let's spread out.</i>

1030
01:35:16,516 --> 01:35:19,314
<i>- Guys, come on.
- Let's get a move on! Come on!</i>

1031
01:35:19,419 --> 01:35:22,820
<i>Come on. Here you go.
Come on. Here you go!</i>

1032
01:35:22,922 --> 01:35:27,052
- Come on. This way! This way!
- They're not doing anything.

1033
01:35:27,160 --> 01:35:31,597
- Come on. This way!
- Come on, baby. Let's go.

1034
01:35:31,698 --> 01:35:34,496
Go out that way. Go out that way.

1035
01:35:36,035 --> 01:35:40,062
<i>- Why won't they go?
- What the fuck is wrong with them?</i>

1036
01:35:40,173 --> 01:35:45,042
<i>- Hey, get your asses in gear!
- How stupid are they?</i>

1037
01:35:45,144 --> 01:35:47,840
Show them there's a hole in the fence.
I don't think they can see it.

1038
01:35:47,947 --> 01:35:52,441
Come on. Lookit! Lookit!
There's no fence. Run!

1039
01:35:52,552 --> 01:35:54,452
Come on! No fence!

1040
01:35:54,554 --> 01:35:56,579
- Come on!
- Come on! Come on! Come on!

1041
01:35:56,689 --> 01:35:59,180
<i>- No fence, you fucking morons!
- Over here. This way!</i>

1042
01:35:59,292 --> 01:36:02,523
Whoa! That motherfucker
almost just gored me, man.

1043
01:36:02,628 --> 01:36:05,563
<i>Don't you wanna be free?
It's wide open. Go!</i>

1044
01:36:05,665 --> 01:36:07,690
<i>They're gonna kill you!</i>

1045
01:36:07,800 --> 01:36:11,566
They're gonna kill
every single one of you!

1046
01:36:11,671 --> 01:36:14,139
<i>- Car!
- Oh, shit!</i>

1047
01:36:14,240 --> 01:36:16,606
<i>Time to go! Time to go!</i>

1048
01:36:16,709 --> 01:36:20,611
- Come on! Let's get outta here!
- Don't you wanna be free?

1049
01:36:20,713 --> 01:36:23,375
Don't you wanna be free?

1050
01:36:25,218 --> 01:36:26,651
<i>- Come on.
- Amber!</i>

1051
01:36:26,753 --> 01:36:28,448
Come on, Amber!

1052
01:36:28,554 --> 01:36:31,990
Car's that way, Andrew!
Come on, Amber!

1053
01:36:32,091 --> 01:36:35,492
<i>We're gonna hit the road! Let's go!</i>

1054
01:36:35,595 --> 01:36:37,495
Let's move!

1055
01:36:37,597 --> 01:36:39,428
Come on, come on!

1056
01:36:39,532 --> 01:36:42,160
Let's go!

1057
01:36:56,883 --> 01:36:59,784
What a fuckin' fiasco.

1058
01:36:59,886 --> 01:37:01,945
Look, nobody got arrested.
Nobody got hurt.

1059
01:37:02,054 --> 01:37:03,954
Yeah, and we learned something.

1060
01:37:04,056 --> 01:37:07,787
- Yeah?
- Don't try something unless
you know what you're doing.

1061
01:37:07,894 --> 01:37:11,694
Next time, we bring cattle prods.
That was our only mistake.

1062
01:37:11,798 --> 01:37:14,858
Oh, yeah. That's a good one.
Paco, ace cattle rustler from New Jersey.

1063
01:37:14,967 --> 01:37:17,868
<i>Fuck you.
At least we tried, man.</i>

1064
01:37:17,970 --> 01:37:19,870
Better than sitting on our asses.

1065
01:37:19,972 --> 01:37:23,669
<i>I just don't understand.
Why would they wanna stay in there?</i>

1066
01:37:23,776 --> 01:37:26,609
<i>Well, let's face it.
Cows aren't the brightest animals.</i>

1067
01:37:26,712 --> 01:37:29,909
<i>Who knows?
Maybe it's easier in there.</i>

1068
01:37:30,016 --> 01:37:31,506
They get all the food they want.

1069
01:37:31,617 --> 01:37:34,142
I bet that genetically engineered shit
tastes better than grass.

1070
01:37:34,253 --> 01:37:36,187
I think they're just scared.

1071
01:37:36,289 --> 01:37:38,655
So was Andrew.
Did you see how fuckin' fast he ran?

1072
01:37:38,758 --> 01:37:41,818
<i>Oh, yeah, yeah.
And you were right behind me, fucker.</i>

1073
01:37:41,928 --> 01:37:43,828
I don't know.

1074
01:37:43,930 --> 01:37:46,125
How come, in real life,
the bad guys always win?

1075
01:37:46,232 --> 01:37:49,531
<i>Well, you know, they do until they don't.</i>

1076
01:40:02,068 --> 01:40:03,968
Last night, hombre.

1077
01:43:01,080 --> 01:43:03,014
<i>Okay, Mike.</i>

1078
01:45:29,895 --> 01:45:32,887
Which all adds up
to us believing that next quarter...

1079
01:45:32,998 --> 01:45:36,024
will be the best time
to introduce a major new product.

1080
01:45:37,269 --> 01:45:39,328
And along those lines, um-

1081
01:45:39,438 --> 01:45:41,702
Don, you wanna take it from here?

1082
01:45:44,009 --> 01:45:46,068
Yeah. Um-

1083
01:45:46,178 --> 01:45:48,612
Well, as you all know,
the Barbecue Big One...

1084
01:45:48,714 --> 01:45:51,012
has been testing off the charts
for months.

1085
01:45:51,116 --> 01:45:53,482
And, uh, I really feel like...

1086
01:45:53,585 --> 01:45:56,884
the marketing department's
nailed the campaign, Jack.

1087
01:45:58,991 --> 01:46:03,394
<i>So, it's obviously time
for the big launch. And...</i>

1088
01:46:05,731 --> 01:46:07,631
we couldn't be more ready to go.
