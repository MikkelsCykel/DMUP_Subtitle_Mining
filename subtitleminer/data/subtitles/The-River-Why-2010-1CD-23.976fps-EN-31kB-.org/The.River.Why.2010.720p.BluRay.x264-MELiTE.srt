1
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:09,661
The surface of the earth...

2
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,029
is 30 percent land...

3
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:13,532
and 70 percent water.

4
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:16,502
A newborn baby is composed
of 70 percent water...

5
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:17,736
and 30 percent
everything else.

6
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:21,673
I guess this means...

7
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,109
that life and water
are inseparable.

8
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:26,945
A human child at birth
undergoes a ritual...

9
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,849
almost identical to that
inflicted upon a trout at death.

10
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,818
The fish is whacked
on the head...

11
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:34,786
thus putting it
out of its misery.

12
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:36,088
The infant is whacked
on the behind...

13
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,691
thus initiating it
into its misery.

14
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:46,064
Upon my birth, my father
made sure that I was given...

15
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:49,801
the proud, manly name
of Augustine.

16
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:53,338
And since I was born into
the first family of angling...

17
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:54,907
it should come
as no surprise...

18
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:57,209
that I was a fishing prodigy.

19
00:02:57,343 --> 00:03:00,078
I caught my first steelhead
with my mom...

20
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:03,515
on a worm when I was four.

21
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:07,352
I didn't feel any hostility
towards land dwellers.

22
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:10,489
I just had water
on the brain.

23
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:12,691
The only thing I gave
much thought to...

24
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:18,096
was bait versus fly.

25
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:19,731
On my tenth birthday...

26
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:22,768
I caught my 180th steelhead
with my dad...

27
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:24,803
on a fly.

28
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:27,139
By the time high school
rolled around...

29
00:03:27,273 --> 00:03:29,575
I was great
at attracting steelhead.

30
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,743
Not so great
with the cheerleaders.

31
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,479
And when most kids
were making college plans...

32
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:35,514
I didn't bother.

33
00:03:35,648 --> 00:03:36,648
Gross.

34
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:38,283
Figured the only
institution...

35
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:39,618
my grades would get me in...

36
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:42,754
was the Oregon State Pen.

37
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,156
But on water?

38
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:47,793
I understand
the way fish think.

39
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:50,429
My parents' union...

40
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:53,298
is one of stubborn,
extremely loyal...

41
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:56,702
hot-tempered,
polar opposites.

42
00:03:56,836 --> 00:03:58,837
Ma is a bait fisher...

43
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:02,774
an expert plunker of worms.

44
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,877
My father
is a writer secondarily...

45
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:09,615
and a famous
fly fisherman primarily.

46
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,750
My brother Bill Bob
is different...

47
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:13,118
than the rest of us.

48
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:16,255
He was born
with a prodigious ability...

49
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:19,057
to ignore
all things aquatic...

50
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:23,028
which to a massive extent
implies his entire family.

51
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:24,463
He hates water.
Won't drink it.

52
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:27,165
He wears galoshes and a hat...

53
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,467
almost every day...

54
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:29,801
just to stay clear
of the stuff.

55
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:33,538
Not that he doesn't need
a little protection...

56
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:35,207
from other hazards
now and then.

57
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:37,943
Good thing Ma has
native intelligence.

58
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:39,344
And she always seems to be

59
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,246
in the right place
at the right time.

60
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,452
My father's battle...

61
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:22,688
with a giant steelhead
he named Nijinsky...

62
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:25,123
was the stuff of legends.

63
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:28,727
And the story of that fish
brought him fame, fortune...

64
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:31,096
and a healthy ego.

65
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,798
Raised by
English aristocrats...

66
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:36,201
he inherited their speech
and manners.

67
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:39,438
When he autographs a book,
he writes his entire name...

68
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:41,740
Henning Hale Orviston.

69
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:43,241
To approach every task-

70
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:45,077
I call him H20.

71
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:47,512
He's the one person
in the world...

72
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,948
who calls me by the name
on my birth certificate.

73
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,983
Augustine...

74
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:55,287
best get another box
from the car.

75
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:58,123
I just brought in three boxes.

76
00:05:58,257 --> 00:06:00,525
Tell you what, Augustine.

77
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,728
Until you find someone else
to employ you...

78
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:06,498
you might want to do
what I request.

79
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:09,034
Yes, sir!

80
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:12,938
Do you have children?

81
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:14,339
Oh, yeah.

82
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:39,998
Before I take
a few questions...

83
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:41,333
let me conclude by saying...

84
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:43,435
I like to think
of this legislation...

85
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:46,304
as the Worship the Waters Act.

86
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:48,240
Yes, little lady.

87
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:50,876
Hi. Um, curious.

88
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:54,713
How can building all those
new dams be an act of worship?

89
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:58,617
I mean, even if the wild salmon
are lucky enough to survive...

90
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:01,119
the turbines on their
pilgrimage up the river...

91
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,321
their smolt will be
swallowed, of course...

92
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:06,258
by the predators on their
way back to the ocean.

93
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:10,896
Maybe we should call it the
Slaughter the Salmon Act instead.

94
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:13,532
There may be some collateral
damage to the salmon...

95
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:17,569
but this will create jobs
and cut taxes, and besides...

96
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:20,505
we are making great strides
with aquaculture these days.

97
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,907
You'd be amazed
what we're doing...

98
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,275
with farmed salmon.

99
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:25,043
There's
no smoking here.

100
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:26,378
You need
to put that out.

101
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:28,079
Of course.
The environment.

102
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:29,114
Come on.

103
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:30,482
Certainly.

104
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,951
Let's go.
Come one.

105
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:34,586
There's no evidence...

106
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,088
that consuming farmed
salmon poses any threat.

107
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:39,491
Yeah, you and I
can debate that.

108
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,461
But we can both agree that fish
have better places to live...

109
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:45,163
than pools
of their own shit!

110
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:59,110
Where are
my books, Augustine?

111
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:01,680
My name is Gus!

112
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:07,219
♫ And none may come for days ♫

113
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:08,487
Sorry.

114
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:09,988
Sorry.

115
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:41,186
My parents argued
about a lot of things.

116
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,723
But it was never a question of
who would have the last word...

117
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,925
merely who would have
the next one.

118
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:51,563
How could I tell them I was
thinking about leaving home...

119
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:54,666
when I couldn't even
get a word in edgewise.

120
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:06,611
So, Hen...

121
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:10,782
have you ever been
to Royal Lake?

122
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:12,284
If I have...

123
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:14,052
the brain cells
recollecting it...

124
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:19,291
have been destroyed
by this merciful beverage.

125
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:21,593
So go ahead, Gusser.

126
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,194
Tell him
about that record bass...

127
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:25,030
you and Bill Bob pulled
out of there that time.

128
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:26,331
Ma.

129
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:28,600
Augustine, you call
yourself a fisherman?

130
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,835
I call myself Gus.

131
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:34,105
Well, Gus...

132
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,408
why were you fishing
for bass?

133
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:38,443
Dutch Hines says that-

134
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,745
Dutch Hines is an idiot.
What does he know? Bass.

135
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,447
Bass!

136
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,883
It's been said
that a man with a Bible...

137
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:47,319
is more dangerous
than a man with a gun.

138
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:50,221
Izaak Walton's
The Compleat Angler...

139
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:52,357
was my father's Bible.

140
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:54,693
"The king of fish,
the trout. "

141
00:09:54,827 --> 00:09:57,062
And since the time
I was a toddler...

142
00:09:57,196 --> 00:09:59,764
I heard it quoted
and misquoted daily.

143
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:04,536
"via the fly rod, the most
aesthetically perfect experience...

144
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:08,173
available to mortal-"
Don't break my book.

145
00:10:08,307 --> 00:10:11,943
Don't worry about
your stupid book. Here.

146
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:14,245
"Come. Let's
kill them all.

147
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:17,015
"Then let's go find
an honest alehouse...

148
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:19,851
"where we may drink
a cup of barley wine...

149
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:21,286
and rejoice together. "

150
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,187
Completely mistaken.

151
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:23,388
I swear, Hen.

152
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:24,856
You've taken
his facetious humor...

153
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:26,791
and turned it into
a mortal condemnation.

154
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:28,760
You bribed your
teacher for your diploma.

155
00:10:28,894 --> 00:10:31,062
Shows a lack of humor.
The trout-

156
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:33,365
Ike Walton wrote all
that about fly fishing...

157
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:35,734
just so he could make
some extra pocket money.

158
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:51,116
Stop! Just
shut up! Stop.

159
00:10:56,756 --> 00:11:00,492
What would you think of me
if I didn't fly fish?

160
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:02,627
You know what you are?
You're a fishing fascist.

161
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:05,497
You're a diarrhea-mouthed
bigot who's blind to anyone...

162
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:09,634
who doesn't drool over the
sound of your stupid, suave talk.

163
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:11,403
The only person you
love is yourself...

164
00:11:11,537 --> 00:11:13,538
because you've got your head
so far up your own ass-

165
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:14,973
All right now,
Gus Orviston...

166
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:16,908
that's no way
to talk to your father.

167
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:18,543
What in hell's
gotten into you?

168
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,645
You're a greedy,
gloating shrew...

169
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,048
and you don't know shit
about fishing or living.

170
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,216
Neither one of you do
because you're just both...

171
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,384
dug so deep
in your ruts...

172
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,053
that you've got mud
in your ears.

173
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,971
I gotta
get out of here.

174
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:49,207
See this?

175
00:11:49,341 --> 00:11:51,976
No no no,
not Nijinsky.

176
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:54,345
This is the source
of all your bullshit.

177
00:11:56,816 --> 00:12:00,118
Nijinsky was an honored
part of our family...

178
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:03,354
since before
I was even born.

179
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:04,756
And even though his body...

180
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,825
was stuck
over the living room mantle...

181
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,095
his spirit haunted
every corner of my life.

182
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:15,667
What can you say after you've
spontaneously cremated...

183
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:18,670
your parent's prized fish
in the fireplace?

184
00:12:18,804 --> 00:12:20,505
The only thing
that came to my mind

185
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,174
was "Good-bye. "

186
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:27,312
For me, happiness
would never be found...

187
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:30,215
anywhere but on the banks
of a river anyway.

188
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:31,816
So I took the few
possessions I owned-

189
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:32,884
Bye, Gus.

190
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:34,552
and turned to the river.

191
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:37,722
And to a new life devoid of
every obstacle between me...

192
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:41,459
and my beloved
art of angling.

193
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:48,933
♫ I will ask it plain ♫

194
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:53,772
♫ 'Cause I just have
One way to speak ♫

195
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:55,607
♫ Help to make me strong ♫

196
00:12:55,741 --> 00:13:00,278
♫ Because this world
Has made me weak ♫

197
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:03,281
♫ I remember
when I started out ♫

198
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:07,018
♫ There wasn't anything ♫

199
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:10,021
♫ Any man or any country ♫

200
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:14,926
♫ Any court or any king ♫

201
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:18,029
♫ That ever kept me ♫

202
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:21,933
♫ From my calling ♫

203
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:24,569
♫ Oh ♫

204
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:28,573
♫ No wall so tall ♫

205
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:32,944
♫ I could not scale ♫

206
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:39,651
♫ But now I feel ♫

207
00:13:39,785 --> 00:13:44,489
♫ Like I am falling ♫

208
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:46,724
♫ Oh ♫

209
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:54,866
♫ Lord, don't let me fail ♫

210
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,602
♫ Let me run like
I'm a river ♫

211
00:13:57,736 --> 00:14:02,006
♫ Let me travel

212
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:09,447
♫ Lord don't let it fail ♫

213
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:12,150
♫ Let me run
Like I'm a river ♫

214
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:16,321
♫ Let me travel

215
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:18,690
♫ Let me run

216
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:22,994
♫ Let me travel
Like a train ♫

217
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:25,763
♫ Let me run
like I'm a river ♫

218
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:29,400
♫ Let me travel ♫

219
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:33,905
♫♫ Travel like a train ♫♫

220
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:42,066
There's just nothing
like the feel...

221
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:44,168
of a trout dancing
through the river...

222
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:47,238
making the pole pulse
like a heart in your hands.

223
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,208
It does to your hands...

224
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,477
what dreams of eternity
do to your heart.

225
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:55,713
And yet, I killed the trout.

226
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:58,649
It's strange to kill
your dance partner...

227
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:01,085
but that's what I did.

228
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,087
I did it because the world
is strange.

229
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:06,190
Because the world does not allow
you to make up your own rules...

230
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:08,359
based on how you would
wish things to be.

231
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:11,162
Because this is a world
where no matter who you are...

232
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:13,698
your happiness,
your survival...

233
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:16,934
is based on sacrifice.

234
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:20,805
Sweet, bleeding sacrifice.

235
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:37,755
Nice work, son.

236
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:42,026
Very nice.

237
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:44,228
How many you got?

238
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:46,030
About a hundred.

239
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:49,333
I'll take 'em all.

240
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:51,135
Great!

241
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:56,040
Hey! Stop!

242
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:57,742
Hey.

243
00:17:57,876 --> 00:17:58,709
Howdy there.

244
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:00,011
Howdy.

245
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:02,947
Hi. My
name's Kernie.

246
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,083
And, uh,
this is Bernie...

247
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:07,552
and Marlene and Charlene and Darlene...

248
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:10,188
and this one right
here is Ernie...

249
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:12,557
except we call him
Hemingway for short.

250
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:13,791
I'm Gus.

251
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,359
Oh, yeah. Yeah,
yeah, we know.

252
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:17,762
Yeah, you live right up there, upstream

253
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:18,896
by the reef forest.

254
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:22,166
Hey, uh...

255
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:23,401
maybe,
do you guys...

256
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:26,437
want some fish,
smoked fish-

257
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:27,705
Yeah! Yeah!

258
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,674
No, no, no. Don't grab, don't grab.

259
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:33,678
Well, while you guys
pick at that, I'm gonna...

260
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:34,645
move on
down the road.

261
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,114
Oh, wait.
No, no, no.

262
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:39,484
We got some stuff for
you. Just wait right here.

263
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,590
Hey, you like fishing?

264
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:48,126
If you ever want a lesson
or anything, you know...

265
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,961
you can just
come by my cabin.

266
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:51,996
Here you go.

267
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,364
Oh, whoa.

268
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:55,333
These are brand-new,
so they're really good.

269
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:56,801
Wow, thank you.
Okay. Wow.

270
00:18:56,935 --> 00:18:58,236
Hello.

271
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:01,072
Wow. This is really-
I don't- I can't-

272
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:03,374
Oh, no, no, no. It's good, it's good.

273
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:04,609
It's great.

274
00:19:04,743 --> 00:19:05,743
You're fine.

275
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:06,844
Hi, I'm Gus.

276
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,045
Yeah, I know.

277
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,480
Thank you.

278
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:12,150
Bye.

279
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:14,018
Thank you.
Nice meeting you.

280
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:32,603
Nice job, Rodney.

281
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:41,005
Alfred
I promise...

282
00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:43,241
I'll eat
something else tomorrow.

283
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:35,293
Abe, are you out there?

284
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:38,763
Abe! Are you all right?

285
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:40,931
Hey, have you seen
a lone fisherman?

286
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:43,934
Sorry. I haven't
seen anyone.

287
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:46,337
Abe!

288
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:51,075
Abe!

289
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:54,879
Abe, where are you?

290
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:57,915
Abe, come on!

291
00:22:00,852 --> 00:22:02,820
Abe!

292
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,211
Oh!

293
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:14,625
Oh!

294
00:24:25,263 --> 00:24:28,833
There's one thing
you can say about nature.

295
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:33,404
If you make one lousy rule
to describe it...

296
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:37,508
it'll contradict you even if
it has to bust its ass to do so.

297
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:42,379
And so what? If anybody ever
discovered the real laws of nature...

298
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:44,715
nature would rear back
and strike him dead...

299
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:46,383
before he could
pass on the news.

300
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:48,252
Jesus Christ.

301
00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:50,955
No. I think
his name is Abe.

302
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:55,793
Maybe Abe knew.

303
00:24:55,927 --> 00:24:58,462
Maybe he had just figured
the whole world out...

304
00:24:58,597 --> 00:25:01,932
and was about to tell me
as I floated past.

305
00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:05,002
But God caught wind of it and
stuck out His invisible foot...

306
00:25:05,136 --> 00:25:07,638
tripped and drowned him.

307
00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:12,877
If the fool only knew
how to swim.

308
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:28,392
Easy, friend.

309
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:31,829
Let's see if we can
thaw you out.

310
00:25:39,237 --> 00:25:40,571
I am Titus.

311
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:44,508
Titus I rving Gerrard.
At your service.

312
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:47,945
Nice to meet you. I...

313
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:49,280
am simply Gus.

314
00:25:49,414 --> 00:25:51,215
Simply Gus?
I don't think so.

315
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:52,783
Anyone who knows
the secrets...

316
00:25:52,918 --> 00:25:54,518
to the catches
you made today...

317
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:55,753
is not simply anything.

318
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:57,588
There's no secrets
to those catches.

319
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,857
The trout I caught
on a wet fly.

320
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:02,226
The corpse I caught
on a soggy dry.

321
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,594
Yes, well...

322
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:06,897
you've done old Abe's
family some service...

323
00:26:07,032 --> 00:26:08,365
by collecting his remains.

324
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,302
And since we're all bodily
destined for corpsehood...

325
00:26:11,436 --> 00:26:13,671
and spiritually possessed
of immortal souls...

326
00:26:13,805 --> 00:26:16,941
I see no reason to let the
proximity of corpses ruin our day.

327
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:19,577
If you think we're all
possessed by immortal souls...

328
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:21,111
I'd sure like
to see them.

329
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:24,315
Maybe you're looking
in the wrong places.

330
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:38,963
For clear vision.

331
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,631
Thanks.

332
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:43,100
M m-hm.

333
00:26:43,234 --> 00:26:46,837
And uh,
thanks for the ride.

334
00:27:26,077 --> 00:27:27,878
A fisherman is dead.

335
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:34,518
Everyone I know
will one day be dead.

336
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:36,453
What can I do about it?

337
00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:39,490
Death is the most natural
thing there is...

338
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:42,226
and we all have a knack for
it. The only question is...

339
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:46,130
when we'll master it.
Doesn't matter what we do...

340
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:48,732
or what we don't do.

341
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:56,173
This is no passing thought.

342
00:27:56,307 --> 00:28:00,678
It's a gnawing emptiness
more real than the cold.

343
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:22,332
This is bullshit.

344
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:26,570
Ma tossed
the baby rabbit skeleton...

345
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,372
I had hanging in my closet.

346
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:38,015
Is that tonight's dreefee?

347
00:28:38,149 --> 00:28:39,416
Yep.

348
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,318
I had to get a new one.

349
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:44,788
Whatever helps you sleep,
Bill Bob.

350
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:45,956
Gussy?

351
00:28:46,091 --> 00:28:48,792
Bill Bob?

352
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:50,527
I thought it might make
you feel better...

353
00:28:50,662 --> 00:28:52,663
to explain that you've
got a garden angel.

354
00:28:52,797 --> 00:28:54,098
You mean guardian angel?

355
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:57,301
Nah. See, you think
you're alone.

356
00:28:57,435 --> 00:29:00,304
But you're not.
You've got a garden angel...

357
00:29:00,438 --> 00:29:02,740
that's your twin.

358
00:29:02,874 --> 00:29:04,575
It's called a guardian angel.

359
00:29:04,709 --> 00:29:07,077
No. I'm talking
about a garden angel.

360
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:10,314
It's like your shadow.

361
00:29:27,198 --> 00:29:29,032
Dreefee.

362
00:29:43,381 --> 00:29:46,083
Garden angel.

363
00:29:46,217 --> 00:29:49,720
Gussy, garden angels
come from the ground...

364
00:29:49,854 --> 00:29:51,388
like carrots.

365
00:29:51,523 --> 00:29:53,423
When they first
come out of the ground...

366
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:55,592
into the garden world,
they're very old...

367
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:57,327
or hurt, or sick.

368
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,029
And the longer
the angels live there...

369
00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:00,397
the younger and smaller
they grow

370
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:01,965
and happier and friendlier
they get.

371
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,600
When they get little little...

372
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:06,603
they disappear out of the garden
world and into our world...

373
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:08,205
and we trade places.

374
00:30:08,339 --> 00:30:09,606
We what?

375
00:30:09,741 --> 00:30:11,942
We trade places
with our twin.

376
00:30:12,076 --> 00:30:13,977
We go there and our twin comes here.

377
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:17,281
We journey up and up
through a long black tunnel...

378
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:20,017
till we reach
the garden angel grounds.

379
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:22,019
Sprout up like carrots.

380
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:24,521
Trade back and forth.

381
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:28,926
Does knowing this make you feel
a little less lonely, Gussy?

382
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,761
Yeah, Bill Bob.

383
00:30:30,895 --> 00:30:32,629
Thanks.

384
00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:53,203
Oh, sorry.

385
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:56,807
Uh, I'm, uh-

386
00:32:56,941 --> 00:32:58,475
Don't get scared.

387
00:32:58,609 --> 00:33:03,714
I'm just- I'm just
a marmless misher-

388
00:33:03,848 --> 00:33:06,917
I just came here
to go swimming.

389
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:14,858
Oops.

390
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,727
I gotta go.

391
00:33:16,861 --> 00:33:19,029
You know, um-

392
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:21,298
Do not- Uh.

393
00:33:21,432 --> 00:33:23,433
Bye.

394
00:33:37,215 --> 00:33:38,515
Hey!

395
00:33:38,649 --> 00:33:41,351
You all right up there?

396
00:33:41,486 --> 00:33:42,719
Yeah.

397
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:45,655
Well, are you hurt?

398
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:48,325
I- No- No!

399
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:52,662
Can you get down?

400
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:55,332
No.

401
00:33:55,466 --> 00:33:58,468
Why not?

402
00:33:58,603 --> 00:34:00,370
Just 'cause.

403
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:01,705
All right, mummy mouth.

404
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:03,807
If that's all you got
for me, good luck.

405
00:34:03,941 --> 00:34:06,743
No, no, no.
Don't go.

406
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:08,478
Why not?

407
00:34:08,613 --> 00:34:10,280
"No life, good scholar...

408
00:34:10,415 --> 00:34:12,849
"no life so happy
and so pleasant...

409
00:34:12,984 --> 00:34:15,318
"as the life
of a well-governed angler.

410
00:34:15,453 --> 00:34:17,320
"So we may say that God
never did make...

411
00:34:17,455 --> 00:34:20,690
"a more calm, quiet...

412
00:34:20,825 --> 00:34:25,295
innocent recreation
than angling. "

413
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:26,930
I don't suppose he did.

414
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:30,267
And now, I think it's time...

415
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:32,102
for you to repair
to your angle rod...

416
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:34,905
which should not be left in
the water to fish for itself.

417
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:37,307
Oh, yeah, is that what
we've been doing, huh?

418
00:34:37,442 --> 00:34:39,976
Funny, 'cause I thought...

419
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:41,878
I was trying to catch me
a steelhead.

420
00:34:42,013 --> 00:34:45,916
And you, what are you
doing here?

421
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:49,186
I am a fisherman, but I
only came here to swim.

422
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,022
If you're a fisherman,
where's your gear?

423
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:54,825
My gear is at home,
on the Tamanawis.

424
00:34:54,959 --> 00:34:59,429
"But let us say grace
and fall to breakfast.

425
00:34:59,564 --> 00:35:00,997
What say you, scholar?"

426
00:35:01,132 --> 00:35:02,833
You can say grace
all you want.

427
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:04,801
Just don't fall
to breakfast, please.

428
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:07,904
Why not?

429
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:10,040
Because you're gonna
break your neck...

430
00:35:10,174 --> 00:35:12,876
before I figure out
that lingo of yours.

431
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:17,414
It's Zizak Waltley.
I mean Zisac Walters-

432
00:35:17,548 --> 00:35:19,616
Izaak Walton?

433
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:23,053
Yes!

434
00:35:23,187 --> 00:35:25,155
And what is your name?

435
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:26,823
Crawl me Gust.

436
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:29,326
Wh-Wh-Wh-What's
your name?

437
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:35,932
Eddy.

438
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:38,001
Just Eddy.
Nice to meet you.

439
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:41,705
Eddy, like the swirvles
in the river wattle.

440
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:44,141
I wish.

441
00:35:44,275 --> 00:35:46,076
No.

442
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:48,278
Eddy like my dad, Edwin.

443
00:35:51,749 --> 00:35:53,483
You got- You got-
You got a bite.

444
00:35:53,618 --> 00:35:55,018
Hm?

445
00:36:24,415 --> 00:36:25,949
Where'd you go?

446
00:38:03,014 --> 00:38:04,848
Aiee!

447
00:38:04,982 --> 00:38:08,151
Sacajawea Argeiphontes!
I am wounded.

448
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,319
Titus?

449
00:38:21,565 --> 00:38:24,367
The Sufi Attar
has written...

450
00:38:24,502 --> 00:38:27,704
"One tiny fly which
entered the ear of Nimrod...

451
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:30,373
troubled the brain
of that idiot for centuries. "

452
00:38:30,508 --> 00:38:34,277
Please, Gus.
Spare me Nimrod's fate.

453
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:37,714
It's hopeless.

454
00:38:37,848 --> 00:38:40,250
I'll never catch one
of those beautiful trout.

455
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:42,352
Whoops. You just used
one of the two words...

456
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:46,056
that should be deleted from
every true fisherman's vocabulary.

457
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:46,990
Hopeless?

458
00:38:47,124 --> 00:38:49,626
No. Always and never.

459
00:38:52,029 --> 00:38:52,896
How's it feel?

460
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:54,364
Eerie, thanks.

461
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:55,498
Don't mention it.

462
00:38:55,633 --> 00:38:58,535
Consider it de-mentioned.

463
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:01,604
What's that?

464
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:03,740
It's a long, dull story.

465
00:39:03,874 --> 00:39:06,509
If I'm not mistaken,
I've seen that look before.

466
00:39:06,644 --> 00:39:10,380
Is there a woman in this?

467
00:39:11,982 --> 00:39:13,650
Twice she slipped
away now.

468
00:39:13,784 --> 00:39:16,219
She's uncatchable.

469
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,888
Uncatchable
as in never?

470
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:22,025
She's not a fish, Titus.

471
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:24,527
Maybe not, but it
certainly sounds to me...

472
00:39:24,662 --> 00:39:26,629
like you're telling the story
of the one that got away.

473
00:39:26,764 --> 00:39:28,832
Live the rest of my life
without ever seeing...

474
00:39:28,966 --> 00:39:30,633
the beautiful
fisher girl again?

475
00:39:30,768 --> 00:39:34,337
That's- that's a pretty
miserable prospect.

476
00:39:34,472 --> 00:39:35,805
Well-

477
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,707
I guess there's nothing
left to do...

478
00:39:37,842 --> 00:39:40,210
but just drink
till I die.

479
00:39:42,012 --> 00:39:45,215
I'll admit there is no cure
for a soul in your condition...

480
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:49,185
but there are
three consolations.

481
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,921
Okay.

482
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:54,924
One is hope.
You may find her again.

483
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,659
Yeah, fat chance.

484
00:39:56,794 --> 00:39:59,863
Gus, if she's as beautiful
as you say she is-

485
00:39:59,997 --> 00:40:02,065
She's twice as beautiful
as I say she is.

486
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:05,135
She knows your name.
She knows the river.

487
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:06,269
She may find you.

488
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,171
Yeah. We may grow wings.

489
00:40:08,305 --> 00:40:10,306
We might.

490
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:14,711
Okay. What are these
other two consolations?

491
00:40:14,845 --> 00:40:18,114
Well, you've already put down
a healthy dose of the second.

492
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,483
The third, however,
requires more aptitude.

493
00:40:20,618 --> 00:40:22,685
What kind of aptitudes?

494
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,187
Philosophical aptitude.

495
00:40:24,321 --> 00:40:27,357
Titus, I know how
to philosophize...

496
00:40:27,491 --> 00:40:30,059
as well as you
know how to fly cast.

497
00:40:30,194 --> 00:40:33,096
I think you should
get plowed tonight.

498
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:37,467
And tomorrow,
we begin philosophizing.

499
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:38,668
I just told you...

500
00:40:38,803 --> 00:40:40,437
I don't know
how to philosophize.

501
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:44,140
Well, and I don't know
how to fish.

502
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:46,075
Okay. So?

503
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:48,378
So we teach each other.

504
00:40:51,081 --> 00:40:52,916
What have I got to lose?

505
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:56,419
Your unhappiness.

506
00:40:56,554 --> 00:40:58,588
Yeah, right.

507
00:41:03,828 --> 00:41:04,994
What is that?

508
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:07,831
Is that an imitation
of a grasshopper?

509
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:14,170
This is an abstract
representation...

510
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:19,042
of a fat tourist
on a golf course.

511
00:41:19,176 --> 00:41:22,378
It's called Bermuda shorts.

512
00:41:22,513 --> 00:41:24,581
Here, fishy.

513
00:41:24,715 --> 00:41:27,717
I like it. What say we
migrate to a watering hole...

514
00:41:27,852 --> 00:41:30,453
a little closer
to civilization?

515
00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:31,955
To Portland?

516
00:41:32,089 --> 00:41:33,523
Sure.

517
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:36,459
The way that goes ahead often
looks as if it went back.

518
00:41:36,594 --> 00:41:39,162
I just want to go ahead
and find Eddy.

519
00:41:40,464 --> 00:41:41,798
Come on.

520
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,934
Titus?

521
00:42:19,303 --> 00:42:20,303
Titus!

522
00:42:20,437 --> 00:42:23,072
Yes?

523
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:24,707
Ah.

524
00:42:24,842 --> 00:42:26,276
This your dog?

525
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:27,477
Yes.

526
00:42:27,611 --> 00:42:30,179
Well, he's kind of
staring at me.

527
00:42:30,314 --> 00:42:31,314
So?

528
00:42:31,448 --> 00:42:32,849
Does he bite?
Can I move? Or-

529
00:42:32,983 --> 00:42:34,150
Why won't he just
go away?

530
00:42:34,285 --> 00:42:37,053
He
- He doesn't bite without cause.

531
00:42:37,187 --> 00:42:38,821
But, uh,
you should move.

532
00:42:38,956 --> 00:42:40,223
You're in Descartes chair.

533
00:42:41,492 --> 00:42:42,926
Easy there, buddy.

534
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:46,796
I'm just gonna move
over to the couch.

535
00:42:46,931 --> 00:42:48,932
And then Descartes'
silly chair...

536
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:51,601
will be all fine.

537
00:42:55,306 --> 00:42:56,372
Uh, Titus?

538
00:42:56,507 --> 00:43:00,109
The dog's
in Descartes' chair now.

539
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:02,545
And he's rocking. Should
I tell him to get down?

540
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:05,648
No, you shouldn't.
The dog is Descartes.

541
00:43:05,783 --> 00:43:08,651
Oh.

542
00:43:08,786 --> 00:43:10,253
Well.

543
00:43:10,387 --> 00:43:11,721
This is amazing.

544
00:43:11,855 --> 00:43:14,090
How did you teach him to
rock a chair like that?

545
00:43:14,224 --> 00:43:16,693
Don't make a stew
about it, Gus.

546
00:43:16,827 --> 00:43:19,162
You'll only
confuse him.

547
00:43:19,296 --> 00:43:22,231
Descartes' immediate
goal is humanity...

548
00:43:22,366 --> 00:43:24,434
as surely as ours
is divinity.

549
00:43:24,568 --> 00:43:27,537
What?

550
00:43:27,671 --> 00:43:28,905
Sorry. I guess...

551
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:31,374
I'm just from the orthodox
school, you know?

552
00:43:31,508 --> 00:43:35,712
Fido, Rover, fetch,
roll over.

553
00:43:35,846 --> 00:43:38,581
Well, Gus...

554
00:43:38,716 --> 00:43:41,351
are you ready to fish?

555
00:43:41,485 --> 00:43:42,852
Fish for what?

556
00:43:42,987 --> 00:43:44,187
For happiness.

557
00:43:44,321 --> 00:43:48,858
And where
do you fish for that?

558
00:43:48,993 --> 00:43:51,828
You believe that stuff?

559
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:54,397
I'm not sane, Gus.

560
00:43:54,531 --> 00:43:57,000
I believe in the rivers
of living water.

561
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:59,936
I believe our souls
swim in that water.

562
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:03,940
I believe that Jesus,
Buddha, Krishna, Mohamed

563
00:44:04,074 --> 00:44:06,042
are the savor
in that water.

564
00:44:06,176 --> 00:44:08,111
Wish I believed that.

565
00:44:08,245 --> 00:44:11,748
And why don't you?

566
00:44:11,882 --> 00:44:13,783
Bait or fly.

567
00:44:13,917 --> 00:44:15,852
Fried or scrambled.

568
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:17,220
Jesus or Mohamed.

569
00:44:17,354 --> 00:44:18,721
I mean, does it really
make any difference?

570
00:44:18,856 --> 00:44:22,225
Does it
really matter?

571
00:44:22,359 --> 00:44:24,761
Where are all these sages
and buddhas holing up...

572
00:44:24,895 --> 00:44:27,897
now when we really
need 'em?

573
00:44:28,032 --> 00:44:31,234
Well, would you know one
if you met one?

574
00:44:31,368 --> 00:44:33,202
Come on, Titus.

575
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:35,438
Even Izaak Walton talks
about the goodness...

576
00:44:35,572 --> 00:44:36,973
of the God of nature.

577
00:44:37,107 --> 00:44:39,509
I've never seen Him, and
I've fished in ten states.

578
00:44:39,643 --> 00:44:41,911
Whoever, whatever,
wherever He is or isn't...

579
00:44:42,046 --> 00:44:43,713
if He really wants me
to notice Him...

580
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:46,015
maybe He should stop
being so scarce.

581
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:49,752
All right. Why can't a
duffer like me catch a fish?

582
00:44:50,988 --> 00:44:52,722
Isn't the answer obvious?

583
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:55,358
Isn't it because at my
present level of skill...

584
00:44:55,492 --> 00:44:58,027
the fish would have to be
so damn dumb...

585
00:44:58,162 --> 00:45:00,830
and utterly unelusive
as to be not worth catching?

586
00:45:00,964 --> 00:45:02,598
And how much more elusive...

587
00:45:02,733 --> 00:45:05,268
should a thing as wondrous
as a soul be?

588
00:45:05,402 --> 00:45:08,871
Fishermen should be the
easiest of men to convince...

589
00:45:09,006 --> 00:45:12,442
to search for their souls,
because fishing is nothing but...

590
00:45:12,576 --> 00:45:14,143
the pursuit
of the elusive.

591
00:45:14,278 --> 00:45:18,114
How can you be so patient
in searching for fish...

592
00:45:18,248 --> 00:45:20,717
and so hasty
to write off your soul...

593
00:45:20,851 --> 00:45:23,186
because you can't see it?

594
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:45,835
Hi.

595
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:48,838
Yeah. Um...

596
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:51,774
I was looking
for a girl named Eddy...

597
00:46:51,909 --> 00:46:53,376
who works for you.

598
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:56,546
She- She worked
at your casting pool...

599
00:46:56,680 --> 00:47:01,484
at that angling fair
a couple of months ago?

600
00:47:01,618 --> 00:47:03,553
She got a new job?

601
00:47:03,687 --> 00:47:05,655
Okay. Well,
could you maybe tell me...

602
00:47:05,789 --> 00:47:07,790
you know,
where she's working now?

603
00:47:07,925 --> 00:47:11,761
No, because
of privacy issues. Right.

604
00:47:14,698 --> 00:47:19,101
Well, is there a supervisor that
I could talk to or something?

605
00:47:44,161 --> 00:47:46,896
You must be the only
living thing left in here.

606
00:47:57,975 --> 00:48:00,977
I'm thinking about an
ant. That sound good?

607
00:49:42,245 --> 00:49:45,581
Do you think the soul strikes
harder early in the morning...

608
00:49:45,716 --> 00:49:46,916
and late
in the evening...

609
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:48,050
kind of like fish?

610
00:49:48,185 --> 00:49:50,353
Could be.

611
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:51,988
Okay. So how
do you suppose...

612
00:49:52,122 --> 00:49:53,422
I ought to fish
for mine?

613
00:49:53,557 --> 00:49:56,058
With a soul pole,
I suppose.

614
00:49:56,193 --> 00:49:58,060
Where do
I get one?

615
00:49:58,195 --> 00:49:59,895
Right here's good.

616
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:01,297
This where you
got yours?

617
00:50:01,431 --> 00:50:02,398
I got mine here.

618
00:50:02,532 --> 00:50:06,002
You got yours
in there.

619
00:50:12,142 --> 00:50:15,311
I still can't figure out
where this soul pole is.

620
00:50:15,445 --> 00:50:16,479
Shall I show you?

621
00:50:16,613 --> 00:50:17,346
Can you?

622
00:50:17,481 --> 00:50:18,848
I can by analogy.

623
00:50:18,982 --> 00:50:21,350
But you'll have to answer
a few questions first.

624
00:50:21,485 --> 00:50:22,852
Fire away.

625
00:50:22,986 --> 00:50:24,620
All right.

626
00:50:24,755 --> 00:50:28,557
Where is Rodney,
your trusty fishing rod...

627
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:29,692
right now?

628
00:50:29,826 --> 00:50:31,193
At this moment...

629
00:50:31,328 --> 00:50:33,896
he is hanging
on my cabin wall.

630
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:35,464
Who made Rodney...

631
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:37,233
from an
indistinguishable blank...

632
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:40,036
into the singing rod
he is today?

633
00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:41,370
I did.

634
00:50:41,505 --> 00:50:43,672
Yes. And who controls
his destiny?

635
00:50:43,807 --> 00:50:45,441
Decides when he'll
hang on the wall...

636
00:50:45,575 --> 00:50:47,276
or ride in the back
of the pickup truck...

637
00:50:47,411 --> 00:50:48,644
or cast for trout?

638
00:50:48,779 --> 00:50:51,680
And who will, one day,
decide he's worn out...

639
00:50:51,815 --> 00:50:54,083
and consign him
to a funeral pyre?

640
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:55,084
I will.

641
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:56,252
Excellent.

642
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:59,121
Can you get me
a couple of cues?

643
00:50:59,256 --> 00:51:00,389
Yeah. Two of them.

644
00:51:00,524 --> 00:51:03,426
Now, who
do you suppose...

645
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:06,562
created you...

646
00:51:06,696 --> 00:51:08,998
into the living fisherman
you are today?

647
00:51:09,132 --> 00:51:10,132
I wish I knew.

648
00:51:10,267 --> 00:51:11,267
Excellent!

649
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:12,835
And who controls
your destiny?

650
00:51:12,969 --> 00:51:14,370
Wish I knew that, too.

651
00:51:14,504 --> 00:51:17,306
Very good. And who will,
one day...

652
00:51:17,441 --> 00:51:19,742
consign your body
to a wormy grave?

653
00:51:19,876 --> 00:51:21,010
I wish I knew that, too.

654
00:51:21,144 --> 00:51:22,011
Perfect!

655
00:51:22,145 --> 00:51:23,312
Why is that perfect?

656
00:51:23,447 --> 00:51:26,015
All I'm saying is,
"Oh, I wish I knew. "

657
00:51:26,149 --> 00:51:28,417
Come on. Don't you
want me to say...

658
00:51:28,552 --> 00:51:30,820
"God does it," or,
"My soul does it"-

659
00:51:30,954 --> 00:51:34,757
Gus, I'm a philosopher.
I'm not an evangelist.

660
00:51:34,891 --> 00:51:38,494
It's the "I wish I knew"
that is crucial.

661
00:51:38,628 --> 00:51:41,464
I mean, to say, "God did it,"
and then just leave it at that?

662
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:44,633
That's to abandon the search
before it's even begun.

663
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:47,436
Believe me, no one's ever
discovered any truth...

664
00:51:47,571 --> 00:51:52,074
by barfing up Sunday school
answers to questions.

665
00:51:52,209 --> 00:51:54,710
Now, you and I agreed,
did we not...

666
00:51:54,845 --> 00:51:57,146
that Rodney is oblivious...

667
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,715
to everything save
some weight and varnish.

668
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:00,950
We did.

669
00:52:01,084 --> 00:52:03,419
Therefore, does it follow...

670
00:52:03,553 --> 00:52:06,021
that he is
just as oblivious...

671
00:52:06,156 --> 00:52:07,823
to Gus?

672
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:09,959
Even though Gus
is his maker?

673
00:52:10,093 --> 00:52:13,229
Even though Gus
controls his destiny?

674
00:52:13,363 --> 00:52:14,763
Even though Gus is-

675
00:52:14,898 --> 00:52:18,367
Let's go ahead and call it.
Gus is his essence.

676
00:52:18,502 --> 00:52:19,502
Yes, it follows.

677
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:22,204
Then therefore,
is it possible...

678
00:52:22,339 --> 00:52:24,173
that maybe you and I...

679
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:25,474
are just as oblivious...

680
00:52:25,609 --> 00:52:27,076
to the presence
of a Creator?

681
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:30,513
Just as oblivious to a
controller of destiny?

682
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:33,415
Just as oblivious
to our essence?

683
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:36,752
An essence that wields you
and I even more deftly...

684
00:52:36,887 --> 00:52:38,020
than you wield Rodney.

685
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:41,557
Sure, it's possible.

686
00:52:41,691 --> 00:52:42,825
Well, there you have it.

687
00:52:42,959 --> 00:52:44,860
Rodney is to Gus...

688
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:47,296
as Gus is
to his essence.

689
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:49,765
You name the essence soul
and you, sir...

690
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:51,433
have your soul pole.

691
00:52:51,568 --> 00:52:54,136
Me?

692
00:52:54,271 --> 00:52:57,072
So, no matter how
hopelessly stupid I am...

693
00:52:57,207 --> 00:53:02,111
in comparison to my essence
or my soul...

694
00:53:02,245 --> 00:53:06,282
I still have
a profound purpose.

695
00:53:06,416 --> 00:53:08,684
I like that, Titus.

696
00:53:08,818 --> 00:53:10,252
I like that.

697
00:53:10,387 --> 00:53:11,620
Thank you.

698
00:53:11,755 --> 00:53:15,424
I swiped it
from Plotinus.

699
00:53:17,093 --> 00:53:19,828
♫ Wait till I wake up ♫

700
00:53:19,963 --> 00:53:23,032
♫ Wish something
could interrupt ♫

701
00:53:23,166 --> 00:53:28,571
♫ The dream for much too long
I've lingered in ♫

702
00:54:13,683 --> 00:54:14,617
Hold on!

703
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:16,518
Hang onto it. Easy.

704
00:54:16,653 --> 00:54:20,356
Easy. Don't force it,
don't force it.

705
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:21,924
Easy. Easy.

706
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:30,599
That's a real nice
jack salmon, son.

707
00:54:30,734 --> 00:54:34,003
It's not a jack.
It's a sea-run cutthroat.

708
00:54:34,137 --> 00:54:35,971
Oh.

709
00:54:51,488 --> 00:54:52,554
What are you doing?

710
00:54:52,689 --> 00:54:54,990
I'm getting skunked,
God damn it.

711
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:56,892
I've been fishing all day...

712
00:54:57,027 --> 00:55:00,462
and I haven't
even gotten a bounce.

713
00:55:00,597 --> 00:55:02,231
I'm plum jinxed.

714
00:55:02,365 --> 00:55:03,499
Or plum dumb.

715
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:04,800
What's that?

716
00:55:04,934 --> 00:55:07,836
Uh, done.

717
00:55:11,007 --> 00:55:12,775
I got here early
in the morning...

718
00:55:12,909 --> 00:55:14,610
nary a strike.

719
00:55:14,744 --> 00:55:17,079
You come here,
in ten seconds...

720
00:55:17,213 --> 00:55:19,048
zabba dabba doo.

721
00:55:19,182 --> 00:55:21,984
You land a nice jack.

722
00:55:34,597 --> 00:55:35,998
So, you...

723
00:55:36,132 --> 00:55:40,703
know any good tales about
this grand sport of ours?

724
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:41,904
Yeah.

725
00:55:42,038 --> 00:55:44,206
So, what do you know?

726
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:45,874
If you want to catch
a blueback...

727
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:46,909
you're gonna need
some lighter gear.

728
00:55:47,043 --> 00:55:49,211
You have any with you?

729
00:55:52,415 --> 00:55:56,719
I guess, uh...

730
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:58,220
I guess we can both
use my rod.

731
00:55:58,355 --> 00:55:59,488
Ah, now you're talking.

732
00:56:00,757 --> 00:56:02,658
Oh! God dammit!

733
00:56:02,792 --> 00:56:04,660
I am sorry.
I am sorry.

734
00:56:04,794 --> 00:56:06,362
It's okay, it's fine.
It's fine.

735
00:56:06,496 --> 00:56:09,932
Just- How about you
just stay up here...

736
00:56:10,066 --> 00:56:14,503
and hold on to that. I'm gonna,
you know, make us something up.

737
00:56:14,637 --> 00:56:16,271
Okay.

738
00:56:25,415 --> 00:56:27,349
Get yourself-

739
00:56:27,484 --> 00:56:30,018
Get yourself a little
nightcrawler there.

740
00:56:30,153 --> 00:56:31,453
Some clay.
Right there.

741
00:56:31,588 --> 00:56:33,389
Just roll it up
like that...

742
00:56:33,523 --> 00:56:34,490
and smooth it out.

743
00:56:34,624 --> 00:56:36,492
What's that
invention called?

744
00:56:36,626 --> 00:56:41,196
A Hostess Twinkie.

745
00:56:41,331 --> 00:56:42,765
And get ready.

746
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:58,680
I got one!
I got it. I got it.

747
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:01,417
Yeah. Don't
lose it.

748
00:57:01,551 --> 00:57:03,352
I got it!
I got it.

749
00:57:03,486 --> 00:57:05,354
Come on.

750
00:57:07,323 --> 00:57:08,290
You got him.

751
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:09,525
Look at that.

752
00:57:11,728 --> 00:57:12,728
Nice.

753
00:57:12,862 --> 00:57:15,664
Oh. Oh.

754
00:57:15,799 --> 00:57:17,800
What do you say, 18 inches?

755
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:21,336
Oh, you can tell people that's 24.

756
00:57:21,471 --> 00:57:23,939
Love it.

757
00:57:24,073 --> 00:57:25,674
Hey, I gotta
rush back to town...

758
00:57:25,809 --> 00:57:27,876
and write this up
for tomorrow's paper.

759
00:57:28,011 --> 00:57:30,245
For tomorrow's what?

760
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:31,747
Post Telegram.

761
00:57:31,881 --> 00:57:33,682
Dutch Hines.

762
00:57:33,817 --> 00:57:35,150
The F-F-Fishing Dutchman.

763
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:36,251
You're Dutch Hines.

764
00:57:36,386 --> 00:57:38,287
Yeah. What's your name?

765
00:57:38,421 --> 00:57:40,189
I'm just Gus.

766
00:57:40,323 --> 00:57:42,291
But that's really
just a nickname.

767
00:57:42,425 --> 00:57:45,194
So I wouldn't- I would-
I wouldn't use that.

768
00:57:45,328 --> 00:57:48,730
You know, I'd like
to interview you, Gus.

769
00:57:48,865 --> 00:57:51,533
Haven't had
a better day's f-f-fishing...

770
00:57:51,668 --> 00:57:55,637
since I lost nine steelhead
one morning on the Kilchis...

771
00:57:55,772 --> 00:57:59,208
two winters ago. I was
fishing with Fuzz Gramsay.

772
00:57:59,342 --> 00:58:02,277
Yeah, I
- I remember that trip. You wrote about it 12 times.

773
00:58:02,412 --> 00:58:06,782
Yeah! So, you wanna do
an interview?

774
00:58:06,916 --> 00:58:10,586
Um, c-c-

775
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,821
Can I have one second?

776
00:58:12,956 --> 00:58:15,157
Sure.

777
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:22,297
Dutch Hines wants
to interview me.

778
00:58:22,432 --> 00:58:25,100
That idiot's got three-quarter
of a million readers.

779
00:58:25,235 --> 00:58:28,637
He can write about me for
weeks and not be distracted.

780
00:58:28,771 --> 00:58:30,873
Nothing's gonna distract
him for months...

781
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:33,742
'cause he's not gonna
catch a fish for months.

782
00:58:33,877 --> 00:58:36,745
He made Fuzz Gramsay rich
by endorsing him.

783
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:41,350
He endorses me...

784
00:58:41,484 --> 00:58:44,453
and I'll have a thousand
polers by the end of the month.

785
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:52,194
Well, what do you say? You
want to do an interview?

786
00:58:52,328 --> 00:58:54,730
Listen to this, Caroline.

787
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:59,268
"By a stroke of dumb luck, this old
dog learned a bag full of tricks...

788
00:58:59,402 --> 00:59:01,603
"from a young buck
he bumped into...

789
00:59:01,738 --> 00:59:03,939
"who just might be...

790
00:59:04,073 --> 00:59:07,442
"the finest fisherman
this great Northwest of ours...

791
00:59:07,577 --> 00:59:09,811
has seen
in many a decade. "

792
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:20,522
"His friends call him Gus. "

793
00:59:20,657 --> 00:59:23,325
"But he told us this
is just a nickname. "

794
00:59:23,459 --> 00:59:27,729
Okay. My real name
is Antoine Chapeau.

795
00:59:27,864 --> 00:59:32,935
I'm originally from Palm
Springs, California...

796
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:34,736
where I used
to manage a-

797
00:59:34,871 --> 00:59:37,806
a beauty salon.

798
00:59:37,941 --> 00:59:39,374
And I would spend
my whole day...

799
00:59:39,509 --> 00:59:43,412
just looking
at women's hair.

800
00:59:43,546 --> 00:59:44,479
But you know
what, Dutch?

801
00:59:44,614 --> 00:59:45,881
I thought
I was going crazy...

802
00:59:46,015 --> 00:59:47,849
because I'd be looking
at a woman's hair...

803
00:59:47,984 --> 00:59:51,286
and I'd be imagining
five-pound tippets.

804
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:54,690
Or algae or something. Three-pound
leaders. It doesn't matter.

805
00:59:54,824 --> 00:59:58,860
Everything reminded me
of-of the river.

806
00:59:58,995 --> 01:00:00,495
So finally I said,
you know what?

807
01:00:00,630 --> 01:00:03,565
Antoine, this
can't be healthy.

808
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:05,801
So I pulled up the stakes.
I moved to Oregon...

809
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:07,836
and I just
started fishing.

810
01:00:07,971 --> 01:00:10,038
All day
every day, fishing.

811
01:00:10,173 --> 01:00:12,975
"And fish he does, with
a passion and skill...

812
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:15,043
"he claimed he acquired
using a fly rod...

813
01:00:15,178 --> 01:00:17,679
"out in the deserts
around Palm Springs.

814
01:00:17,814 --> 01:00:20,382
"This dry fishing, as he
calls it, is what taught him...

815
01:00:20,516 --> 01:00:24,286
"both the incredible patience
and the shamanistic approach...

816
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:27,189
to the sport
that characterizes him today. "

817
01:00:27,323 --> 01:00:29,725
Listen, I gotta get
back to the paper. Uh...

818
01:00:29,859 --> 01:00:31,660
what do you say we
meet again next week...

819
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:33,462
and you tell me
some more?

820
01:00:33,596 --> 01:00:38,100
Okay. But only if you put a
message in the paper for me.

821
01:00:38,234 --> 01:00:39,768
"Will the girl who ran
from the guy...

822
01:00:39,902 --> 01:00:41,903
"who recited
Izaak Walton in the tree...

823
01:00:42,038 --> 01:00:45,674
"please contact Gus on
the other river he named.

824
01:00:45,808 --> 01:00:47,943
"He has your pole
and your fish...

825
01:00:48,077 --> 01:00:49,611
"and wants
to return them.

826
01:00:49,746 --> 01:00:51,546
"He's totally harmless
but urges you...

827
01:00:51,681 --> 01:00:53,582
"to bring
a loaded gun if scared.

828
01:00:53,716 --> 01:00:56,485
As long as you come.
Thank you. "

829
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:18,740
Gus!

830
01:01:18,875 --> 01:01:20,142
We want to go fishing.

831
01:01:20,276 --> 01:01:22,010
It's time
for another lesson.

832
01:01:22,145 --> 01:01:23,845
Hey, guys. Can we
do it another time?

833
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:25,981
I just- I just don't
really feel like it.

834
01:01:26,115 --> 01:01:29,017
Fishing. Fishing. Fishing.

835
01:01:29,152 --> 01:01:31,853
Let's go fishing.

836
01:01:31,988 --> 01:01:33,655
Let's go.

837
01:01:33,790 --> 01:01:35,223
Here we go.

838
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:51,673
Very nice.

839
01:01:57,613 --> 01:01:58,580
Hey, hey.

840
01:01:58,715 --> 01:01:59,648
Gimme.

841
01:01:59,782 --> 01:02:00,382
Stop. It's snagged.

842
01:02:00,516 --> 01:02:01,516
Gimme.

843
01:02:01,651 --> 01:02:02,584
What?

844
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:04,352
It's snagged. See?

845
01:02:04,487 --> 01:02:05,387
Oh, man.

846
01:02:05,521 --> 01:02:06,922
Whoa,
whoa, hey!

847
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:08,457
Hemingway,
come here.

848
01:02:08,591 --> 01:02:09,591
Come here. Hey!

849
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:11,493
Do you wanna
catch this fish?

850
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:31,947
Just get right here.
That's the spot, okay?

851
01:02:32,081 --> 01:02:35,317
Just head west. Just
head west, all right?

852
01:02:35,451 --> 01:02:38,253
There you go.
Good luck.

853
01:02:38,387 --> 01:02:41,022
How's it going?

854
01:02:41,157 --> 01:02:43,391
Yeah, I fish out here
everyday with 'em.

855
01:02:43,526 --> 01:02:44,626
Those are good.

856
01:02:51,567 --> 01:02:52,567
Good luck.

857
01:02:52,702 --> 01:02:53,969
How's it going?

858
01:02:56,672 --> 01:02:57,773
Uh,

859
01:03:00,543 --> 01:03:03,078
Yeah.

860
01:03:03,212 --> 01:03:04,946
Uh.

861
01:03:05,081 --> 01:03:07,115
Good luck.

862
01:04:52,755 --> 01:04:56,524
See, I read that I should bring
a loaded gun with me, so...

863
01:04:56,659 --> 01:04:59,628
I took your advice
to the letter.

864
01:05:01,631 --> 01:05:03,965
I believe you have my pole.

865
01:05:06,068 --> 01:05:07,535
Right.

866
01:05:22,018 --> 01:05:23,885
And a fish.

867
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,936
Wait, wait, wait. I
- I get the pole and the fish, but...

868
01:05:43,673 --> 01:05:45,407
what's this?

869
01:05:45,541 --> 01:05:49,244
The belly reel that goes with the
- the pole.

870
01:05:54,517 --> 01:05:56,851
And how'd you know
I'd come for them?

871
01:05:56,986 --> 01:05:58,853
I didn't.

872
01:06:00,957 --> 01:06:04,392
Everything in the world
made me think you wouldn't.

873
01:06:12,568 --> 01:06:15,537
There is something
I should tell you.

874
01:06:15,671 --> 01:06:19,741
About that day.

875
01:06:19,875 --> 01:06:22,210
I never ran.

876
01:06:22,345 --> 01:06:24,679
Huh?

877
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:27,615
I never ran away.

878
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:30,852
I was barefoot.
So I...

879
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:32,687
hid in the woods and...

880
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:35,223
I saw you climb
above that pole...

881
01:06:35,358 --> 01:06:37,225
where I hooked
the steelhead.

882
01:06:40,096 --> 01:06:43,398
And then,
I stepped on an orange...

883
01:06:45,568 --> 01:06:46,601
and this.

884
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:53,608
See, when you came
crashing along...

885
01:06:53,743 --> 01:06:55,877
you came from upstream.

886
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:56,811
Uh-

887
01:06:56,946 --> 01:06:58,179
And the orange-

888
01:06:58,314 --> 01:07:01,983
Huh? And the orange
and this, this telescope...

889
01:07:02,118 --> 01:07:05,120
this telescope
were downstream.

890
01:07:05,254 --> 01:07:06,821
Now, I mean, come on.
It doesn't take

891
01:07:06,956 --> 01:07:08,289
Sherlock freakin' Holmes-

892
01:07:08,424 --> 01:07:09,324
Okay.

893
01:07:09,458 --> 01:07:10,458
Okay, okay, okay.

894
01:07:10,593 --> 01:07:12,293
Just listen to me
for a second.

895
01:07:12,428 --> 01:07:13,828
Spying on me.
While I was-

896
01:07:13,963 --> 01:07:15,163
Okay, wait,
hu- Hold- No-

897
01:07:15,297 --> 01:07:16,464
While I was-

898
01:07:16,599 --> 01:07:20,435
Hold on.
Just give me a second.

899
01:07:20,569 --> 01:07:24,372
Okay, I admit
that is my telescope.

900
01:07:24,507 --> 01:07:30,378
And I'm s-sorry that I
was spying on you, but...

901
01:07:30,513 --> 01:07:32,514
really, I was just
wandering around...

902
01:07:32,648 --> 01:07:35,383
looking for a place
to swim and then...

903
01:07:37,553 --> 01:07:38,620
there was you.

904
01:07:41,957 --> 01:07:43,792
This beautiful girl.

905
01:07:43,926 --> 01:07:45,026
And you were fishing.

906
01:07:45,161 --> 01:07:46,528
And the "here
goes nothing" way...

907
01:07:46,662 --> 01:07:48,229
you chucked
that hazel pole...

908
01:07:48,364 --> 01:07:51,232
into the water, and the way you
dove in and swam after it, I-

909
01:07:51,367 --> 01:07:54,436
I just knew that you had some
way of looking at things...

910
01:07:54,570 --> 01:07:56,538
some way of looking at life
and the world...

911
01:07:56,672 --> 01:07:58,506
which is exactly the way
of looking at things...

912
01:07:58,641 --> 01:08:00,375
that I've been trying
to look at things.

913
01:08:00,509 --> 01:08:02,177
I n my whole life,
I've only met two people...

914
01:08:02,311 --> 01:08:04,245
who have ever
looked at things...

915
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:06,848
any way close to that way.

916
01:08:06,982 --> 01:08:08,116
My little brother...

917
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:09,884
and a philosopher
who talks to his dog.

918
01:08:10,019 --> 01:08:13,321
And with both of them it
was love at first sight, too.

919
01:08:19,628 --> 01:08:21,429
But I'm not sorry.

920
01:08:24,266 --> 01:08:25,500
When you see
the most amazing...

921
01:08:25,634 --> 01:08:26,901
beautiful thing
you've ever seen...

922
01:08:27,036 --> 01:08:29,604
you don't think about
what's right or polite...

923
01:08:29,738 --> 01:08:32,440
or tell it to cover up.

924
01:08:32,575 --> 01:08:35,043
Because you can't
stop looking.

925
01:08:35,177 --> 01:08:36,544
You s-

926
01:08:36,679 --> 01:08:38,746
You're just helpless.

927
01:08:54,430 --> 01:08:55,730
What's so funny?

928
01:08:55,865 --> 01:08:57,966
I'm sorry.

929
01:09:00,569 --> 01:09:02,237
You.

930
01:09:02,371 --> 01:09:04,439
I n a tree.

931
01:09:04,573 --> 01:09:07,742
Spouting off stuff like...

932
01:09:07,877 --> 01:09:10,211
"Oh, good scholar"

933
01:09:10,346 --> 01:09:13,781
and that "God never made...

934
01:09:13,916 --> 01:09:17,385
"a more pure,
innocent recreation...

935
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:19,754
than angling. "

936
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:27,128
I like that, Gus.

937
01:09:30,566 --> 01:09:33,268
Can I ask you
a question?

938
01:09:33,402 --> 01:09:34,936
Yeah.

939
01:09:35,070 --> 01:09:38,473
What are you
doing here?

940
01:09:38,607 --> 01:09:39,774
This is my cabin.

941
01:09:39,909 --> 01:09:41,676
Shouldn't I be
asking you that?

942
01:09:41,810 --> 01:09:44,145
No.

943
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:47,582
Not here, here.
I mean-

944
01:09:47,716 --> 01:09:49,851
Here!

945
01:09:49,985 --> 01:09:52,187
Here.

946
01:09:52,321 --> 01:09:54,589
Alone.

947
01:10:03,165 --> 01:10:05,533
Fishing.

948
01:10:07,536 --> 01:10:09,504
What are you doing here?

949
01:10:12,841 --> 01:10:14,776
Here here?

950
01:10:16,612 --> 01:10:18,379
Here here.

951
01:10:23,085 --> 01:10:25,787
Fishing.

952
01:10:28,657 --> 01:10:30,525
You know, I saw you
in Portland.

953
01:10:30,659 --> 01:10:34,329
You did?
Where?

954
01:10:34,463 --> 01:10:38,366
I saw you rescue that trout
from that filthy creek.

955
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:41,636
I guess you could
say it made me...

956
01:10:41,770 --> 01:10:44,239
curious.

957
01:10:46,175 --> 01:10:47,108
So, I drove
up here...

958
01:10:47,243 --> 01:10:50,078
to see
what I could see.

959
01:10:50,212 --> 01:10:52,113
And I ran
into this little boy...

960
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:56,551
who called
himself Hemingway.

961
01:10:56,685 --> 01:10:57,819
And he
immediately...

962
01:10:57,953 --> 01:10:59,754
launched into this
epic tale...

963
01:10:59,888 --> 01:11:03,558
about a giant fish that
he caught with help...

964
01:11:03,692 --> 01:11:08,563
from a certain
superhero named Gus.

965
01:11:08,697 --> 01:11:11,199
Who spent seven
minutes under water

966
01:11:11,333 --> 01:11:14,102
before he wrassled the
fish with his bare hands.

967
01:11:14,236 --> 01:11:15,270
Bullshit.

968
01:11:15,404 --> 01:11:16,304
I know.

969
01:11:16,438 --> 01:11:19,440
That's what
I figured.

970
01:11:19,575 --> 01:11:22,310
But I could see
in his eyes...

971
01:11:22,444 --> 01:11:26,080
what little Hemingway
thought of you...

972
01:11:26,215 --> 01:11:30,051
and it made me
even more curious.

973
01:11:37,359 --> 01:11:38,559
You know,
I must have read...

974
01:11:38,694 --> 01:11:40,762
that Fishing
Dutchman's article...

975
01:11:40,896 --> 01:11:43,665
like, 8000 times.

976
01:11:43,799 --> 01:11:46,000
I knew
it was you.

977
01:11:46,135 --> 01:11:49,304
And this time
I came to see you.

978
01:11:52,541 --> 01:11:55,443
And you know
what happened next?

979
01:11:55,577 --> 01:11:59,080
Yeah.

980
01:11:59,214 --> 01:12:01,616
You do?

981
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:03,818
Yeah.

982
01:12:31,513 --> 01:12:35,650
You threw his prize fish in the fire?

983
01:12:35,784 --> 01:12:37,452
It wasn't
just any fish.

984
01:12:37,586 --> 01:12:39,687
He was Nijinsky.

985
01:12:44,026 --> 01:12:46,127
That went over real well, I'm sure.

986
01:12:46,261 --> 01:12:49,464
Uh, not really.

987
01:12:49,598 --> 01:12:52,567
I haven't even spoken
to either of them since.

988
01:12:52,701 --> 01:12:57,004
I don't even know why I came out here.

989
01:12:57,139 --> 01:12:59,574
Guess I just needed to get away.

990
01:12:59,708 --> 01:13:02,510
Your parents seem like
an interesting match.

991
01:13:02,644 --> 01:13:06,247
I nteresting is a kind word for it.

992
01:13:24,666 --> 01:13:28,536
Bravo, Nijinsky.

993
01:13:28,670 --> 01:13:30,271
There are two stories...

994
01:13:30,406 --> 01:13:31,806
of how Nijinsky
found his way...

995
01:13:31,940 --> 01:13:33,741
onto my parents' mantle.

996
01:13:33,876 --> 01:13:37,311
The one that landed
my father his book deal.

997
01:13:37,446 --> 01:13:39,380
And the one
that's the truth.

998
01:13:39,515 --> 01:13:41,849
Both versions begin
the same way.

999
01:13:41,984 --> 01:13:43,284
With an epic struggle...

1000
01:13:43,419 --> 01:13:45,520
between a determined
young fly fisherman...

1001
01:13:45,654 --> 01:13:47,722
and a giant steelhead.

1002
01:13:47,856 --> 01:13:49,290
Little did
either of them realize...

1003
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:50,858
that their true nemesis...

1004
01:13:50,993 --> 01:13:53,561
was lurking somewhere
down river.

1005
01:14:46,381 --> 01:14:48,983
It was my father's
worst nightmare.

1006
01:14:49,117 --> 01:14:50,318
A mere plunker of worms...

1007
01:14:50,452 --> 01:14:52,553
had cost him
his prized Nijinsky.

1008
01:14:52,688 --> 01:14:54,455
Whoever this crude
interloper was...

1009
01:14:54,590 --> 01:14:55,723
he would have
to be dealt with.

1010
01:14:55,858 --> 01:14:56,757
You-

1011
01:14:56,892 --> 01:14:58,125
Man to man.

1012
01:14:58,260 --> 01:15:00,428
had best refrain from that pole
and defend yourself.

1013
01:15:00,562 --> 01:15:02,430
Because one of us
is going in that river...

1014
01:15:02,564 --> 01:15:04,065
in search
of my fish!

1015
01:15:04,199 --> 01:15:05,566
So be it, slicker.

1016
01:15:05,701 --> 01:15:07,502
But I
guaran-goddamn-tee ya...

1017
01:15:07,636 --> 01:15:09,203
It ain't
gonna be me.

1018
01:15:11,607 --> 01:15:14,342
Come on
and fight me!

1019
01:15:14,476 --> 01:15:17,044
Come on and fight me! Come on.

1020
01:15:26,255 --> 01:15:28,122
Oops.

1021
01:15:42,704 --> 01:15:44,772
As my father
watched the woman...

1022
01:15:44,907 --> 01:15:46,707
reel in Nijinsky
for herself...

1023
01:15:46,842 --> 01:15:48,309
he had no idea...

1024
01:15:48,443 --> 01:15:50,645
that she would become
his lifetime adversary.

1025
01:15:52,047 --> 01:15:53,748
She would also
become my mom.

1026
01:16:11,733 --> 01:16:14,702
Looks like you could
use a little warming up.

1027
01:16:19,308 --> 01:16:21,876
My parents came
to an understanding.

1028
01:16:22,010 --> 01:16:26,013
The story would be told as
maybe it should have been.

1029
01:16:26,148 --> 01:16:27,748
After all,
my father reasoned...

1030
01:16:27,883 --> 01:16:30,217
she did cause his
six-pound tippet to snap...

1031
01:16:30,352 --> 01:16:33,621
and he had spent all that
time tiring the fish out...

1032
01:16:33,755 --> 01:16:36,624
making it easy for Ma
to just reel him in.

1033
01:16:41,597 --> 01:16:43,164
So the deal was sealed.

1034
01:16:43,298 --> 01:16:44,932
H20 would have his story.

1035
01:16:45,067 --> 01:16:46,367
But never again...

1036
01:16:46,501 --> 01:16:48,636
would they use anything
resembling reason...

1037
01:16:48,770 --> 01:16:51,706
in their discussion
of the art of angling.

1038
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:54,041
Never again would they
go fishing together...

1039
01:16:54,176 --> 01:16:58,512
and never would their
marriage vows waver or weaken.

1040
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:07,388
Darn it.

1041
01:17:11,193 --> 01:17:13,461
Fly tying is for certain
a tedious task...

1042
01:17:13,595 --> 01:17:17,832
but there's no need to let it
get to you like that, my love.

1043
01:17:17,966 --> 01:17:22,703
Yeah, well, it ain't the
fly that's bothering me.

1044
01:17:22,838 --> 01:17:25,006
Hm. Gus.

1045
01:17:25,140 --> 01:17:26,907
I just can't help
but feel...

1046
01:17:27,042 --> 01:17:30,344
like we let him go.

1047
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:31,679
You can't keep a person...

1048
01:17:31,813 --> 01:17:34,815
in a place he doesn't
want to be.

1049
01:17:34,950 --> 01:17:37,551
No, but can't you at
least make it a place...

1050
01:17:37,686 --> 01:17:40,221
that they might
wanna visit?

1051
01:18:15,791 --> 01:18:18,225
Cripes.

1052
01:18:36,011 --> 01:18:39,313
Give me
the other one.

1053
01:19:08,143 --> 01:19:10,344
What's that?

1054
01:19:10,479 --> 01:19:15,049
Um, it's
today's dreefee.

1055
01:19:15,183 --> 01:19:18,419
What'd you say?

1056
01:19:18,553 --> 01:19:20,554
When you were a kid,
didn't you have...

1057
01:19:20,689 --> 01:19:22,356
you know,
some stuffed animal...

1058
01:19:22,491 --> 01:19:24,058
or a ratty blanket
or something...

1059
01:19:24,192 --> 01:19:25,392
that you
just absolutely...

1060
01:19:25,527 --> 01:19:26,994
could not go
to sleep without?

1061
01:19:28,563 --> 01:19:30,531
I had
the grossest pillow...

1062
01:19:30,665 --> 01:19:32,233
that I had
to take everywhere.

1063
01:19:32,367 --> 01:19:35,369
Okay. Well,
Bill Bob has dreefees.

1064
01:19:35,504 --> 01:19:36,971
Okay.

1065
01:19:39,241 --> 01:19:42,243
A dreefee is a, um...

1066
01:19:42,377 --> 01:19:43,978
it's a carefully
selected relic...

1067
01:19:44,112 --> 01:19:45,946
of that
day's adventure.

1068
01:19:46,081 --> 01:19:48,349
So there's a different one every night.

1069
01:19:48,483 --> 01:19:51,218
And just as important
as the dreefee itself...

1070
01:19:51,353 --> 01:19:55,022
is the placement
of the dreefee.

1071
01:19:55,157 --> 01:19:57,158
And if that's altered
in any way...

1072
01:19:57,292 --> 01:19:58,759
before Bill Bob
falls asleep...

1073
01:19:58,894 --> 01:20:02,129
it has the same effect
of not having one at all.

1074
01:20:02,264 --> 01:20:05,332
And he doesn't fuss, he
doesn't protest, he just-

1075
01:20:05,467 --> 01:20:08,202
doesn't go to sleep.

1076
01:20:08,336 --> 01:20:09,570
All night long.

1077
01:20:09,704 --> 01:20:10,671
M m-hm.

1078
01:20:10,806 --> 01:20:12,139
Wow.

1079
01:20:16,111 --> 01:20:18,112
There was one time
that the dreefee was...

1080
01:20:18,246 --> 01:20:22,349
a- it was
a dried-up dog turd.

1081
01:20:22,484 --> 01:20:24,785
And it had just
- It had been bleached white...

1082
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:28,022
by, you know, the sun
and the elements, and...

1083
01:20:28,156 --> 01:20:32,126
and it was shaped exactly like
a tiny sleeping polar bear.

1084
01:20:32,260 --> 01:20:35,529
But Bill Bob said that it was
a tiny sleeping polar bear.

1085
01:20:35,664 --> 01:20:39,099
And that it had been eaten by a dog
and then it had proved indigestible...

1086
01:20:39,234 --> 01:20:40,801
and then it
had been eliminated...

1087
01:20:40,936 --> 01:20:42,770
and due
to its unmentionable...

1088
01:20:42,904 --> 01:20:45,005
experience in the dog,
it was in a coma.

1089
01:20:45,140 --> 01:20:49,043
Bill Bob was going to invoke
the powers of the Tooth Fairy...

1090
01:20:49,177 --> 01:20:53,314
to bring it
back to life.

1091
01:20:53,448 --> 01:20:57,551
But Ma just threw the poor
polar bear out the window...

1092
01:20:57,686 --> 01:20:59,520
without a question
or even a glance...

1093
01:20:59,654 --> 01:21:04,692
at its miraculously
sculpted bearness.

1094
01:21:04,826 --> 01:21:08,395
She didn't
believe his story.

1095
01:21:08,530 --> 01:21:11,565
Guess not.

1096
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:14,668
And he didn't
sleep all night long?

1097
01:21:14,803 --> 01:21:16,937
M m-mm.

1098
01:21:53,909 --> 01:21:54,875
Here we go.

1099
01:21:55,010 --> 01:21:57,011
Where are
we going?

1100
01:22:00,015 --> 01:22:04,485
Well, I'm going
to Portland tonight...

1101
01:22:04,619 --> 01:22:07,521
and you...

1102
01:22:07,656 --> 01:22:09,523
you're staying here.

1103
01:22:09,658 --> 01:22:10,658
Come on.

1104
01:22:10,792 --> 01:22:11,992
Come on what?

1105
01:22:12,127 --> 01:22:16,163
What's the lightest
leader you've got?

1106
01:22:16,298 --> 01:22:17,965
Three pound.

1107
01:22:18,099 --> 01:22:20,701
All right,
hand me the rod.

1108
01:22:20,835 --> 01:22:24,538
Tie it up
and bait it.

1109
01:22:24,673 --> 01:22:26,240
Come on.

1110
01:22:26,374 --> 01:22:27,942
Will it...

1111
01:22:28,076 --> 01:22:30,344
will it mess up
your plan if I ask...

1112
01:22:30,478 --> 01:22:33,213
what exactly you're doing?

1113
01:22:34,883 --> 01:22:36,116
I'm fishing.

1114
01:22:36,251 --> 01:22:37,217
You do realize...

1115
01:22:37,352 --> 01:22:38,786
there's nothing
but Chinook...

1116
01:22:38,920 --> 01:22:41,889
in the water
right now, don't you?

1117
01:22:42,023 --> 01:22:42,923
I know that.

1118
01:22:43,058 --> 01:22:45,192
Those can weigh fifty pounds.

1119
01:22:45,327 --> 01:22:48,729
I know.

1120
01:22:48,863 --> 01:22:50,297
So...

1121
01:22:50,432 --> 01:22:51,999
even if it
were possible...

1122
01:22:52,133 --> 01:22:55,235
to hook a Chinook...

1123
01:22:55,370 --> 01:22:58,138
on that leader
without breaking it

1124
01:22:58,273 --> 01:23:02,242
you couldn't land him even
if you played him all night.

1125
01:23:05,914 --> 01:23:07,047
I know that.

1126
01:23:07,182 --> 01:23:12,019
But you have to leave
before dark.

1127
01:23:12,153 --> 01:23:14,088
I do.

1128
01:23:14,222 --> 01:23:16,957
But you don't, Gus.

1129
01:23:17,092 --> 01:23:19,126
Got to follow through
with the plan.

1130
01:23:38,346 --> 01:23:40,681
There. Come here, Gus.

1131
01:23:40,815 --> 01:23:43,150
Come here.

1132
01:23:43,284 --> 01:23:46,720
Take the rod.

1133
01:23:46,855 --> 01:23:49,223
Keep your
tip up.

1134
01:23:49,357 --> 01:23:50,691
Don't fight it.

1135
01:23:55,430 --> 01:23:57,498
Play the Chinook.

1136
01:23:57,632 --> 01:23:59,199
What?

1137
01:26:36,124 --> 01:26:39,526
You getting a little
tuckered out there?

1138
01:26:41,529 --> 01:26:43,897
Me too.

1139
01:27:33,381 --> 01:27:35,015
Aha.

1140
01:28:49,324 --> 01:28:50,624
You heading home?

1141
01:28:53,628 --> 01:28:56,163
I thought
you might be a girl.

1142
01:29:22,523 --> 01:29:24,424
As we walked upriver...

1143
01:29:24,559 --> 01:29:26,860
I felt like we were
on a primordial journey...

1144
01:29:26,994 --> 01:29:30,430
to some forgotten,
ancient home.

1145
01:29:30,565 --> 01:29:33,867
The fisherman in me
was being unmade.

1146
01:29:34,001 --> 01:29:35,569
With so light a line...

1147
01:29:35,703 --> 01:29:37,170
there could be no question...

1148
01:29:37,305 --> 01:29:40,273
of ever bringing
this great fish to bay.

1149
01:29:40,408 --> 01:29:42,542
So there would be
no betrayal.

1150
01:29:42,677 --> 01:29:45,779
No struggle.
No sacrifice.

1151
01:29:45,913 --> 01:29:47,814
No death.

1152
01:29:47,949 --> 01:29:49,416
There was only
a Chinook...

1153
01:29:49,550 --> 01:29:51,017
leading an undone fisherman...

1154
01:29:51,152 --> 01:29:53,286
deeper into the night.

1155
01:32:06,087 --> 01:32:08,688
As I watched the sun
wake the valley...

1156
01:32:08,823 --> 01:32:13,026
I felt as though an oldest,
greatest, longest-lost friend...

1157
01:32:13,160 --> 01:32:17,163
had come to walk the road,
unseen, beside me.

1158
01:32:17,298 --> 01:32:19,199
And just as quickly
that feeling left...

1159
01:32:19,333 --> 01:32:21,968
and blended
with the sunlight.

1160
01:32:24,038 --> 01:32:26,873
I knew from this point on
there was no escape...

1161
01:32:27,008 --> 01:32:29,776
and nowhere to go.

1162
01:32:29,911 --> 01:32:32,279
I was already there.

1163
01:33:45,486 --> 01:33:47,253
♫ When the bough broke ♫

1164
01:33:47,388 --> 01:33:50,490
♫ We were crossing America ♫

1165
01:33:54,629 --> 01:33:56,496
♫ You with your stories ♫

1166
01:33:56,631 --> 01:33:59,566
♫ And me hanging on ♫

1167
01:34:03,604 --> 01:34:05,205
♫ Hands on the wheel ♫

1168
01:34:05,339 --> 01:34:08,174
♫ Your hair out the window ♫

1169
01:34:12,079 --> 01:34:14,214
♫ Its counterfeit color ♫

1170
01:34:14,348 --> 01:34:17,684
♫ Danced
In the September air ♫

1171
01:34:21,222 --> 01:34:22,722
♫ When the bough broke ♫

1172
01:34:22,857 --> 01:34:27,227
♫ We were flirting
With Canada ♫

1173
01:34:29,897 --> 01:34:32,332
♫ You said prove
that you love me ♫

1174
01:34:32,466 --> 01:34:34,801
♫ And live with me there ♫

1175
01:34:34,935 --> 01:34:37,237
Today's dreefee.

1176
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:41,574
♫ And leave
All the frivolous ♫

1177
01:34:41,709 --> 01:34:44,678
♫ Back in America ♫

1178
01:34:48,783 --> 01:34:50,150
♫ You found true love ♫

1179
01:34:50,284 --> 01:34:55,088
♫ In a picture
That you saw somewhere ♫

1180
01:34:57,758 --> 01:34:59,359
♫ He took her hand ♫

1181
01:34:59,493 --> 01:35:03,329
♫ They did cartwheels
Right into the air ♫

1182
01:35:05,766 --> 01:35:09,135
♫♫ And then they fell ♫♫

1183
01:35:44,472 --> 01:35:46,306
Eddy!

1184
01:36:06,293 --> 01:36:08,061
Ma?

1185
01:36:15,202 --> 01:36:17,203
What are you doing here?

1186
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:21,674
I'm fishing with Eddy.

1187
01:36:39,593 --> 01:36:40,860
Cripes O'Reilly.

1188
01:36:40,995 --> 01:36:44,397
It's Glum Gus.

1189
01:36:48,302 --> 01:36:49,969
His name is...

1190
01:36:52,540 --> 01:36:54,340
Gus.

1191
01:37:06,086 --> 01:37:07,921
Hen?

1192
01:37:28,142 --> 01:37:31,244
People often don't know
what they're talking about.

1193
01:37:31,378 --> 01:37:33,479
But when they talk
about love...

1194
01:37:33,614 --> 01:37:37,217
they really don't know
what they're talking about.

1195
01:37:37,351 --> 01:37:39,419
The one sure thing
you can say about love...

1196
01:37:39,553 --> 01:37:42,322
is that there isn't much
you can say about it.

1197
01:37:42,456 --> 01:37:43,990
Not that you shouldn't try.

1198
01:37:44,124 --> 01:37:45,625
You can make analogies.

1199
01:37:45,759 --> 01:37:47,560
Love is like a lot of things.

1200
01:37:47,695 --> 01:37:50,363
One thing it's like
is a trout stream.

1201
01:37:50,497 --> 01:37:53,233
Try to capture
a trout stream with a dam...

1202
01:37:53,367 --> 01:37:54,901
and you get a lake.

1203
01:37:55,035 --> 01:37:56,703
Try to catch it in a bucket...

1204
01:37:56,837 --> 01:37:58,738
and you get a bucket
of water.

1205
01:37:58,873 --> 01:38:00,607
Put some under a microscope...

1206
01:38:00,741 --> 01:38:02,075
and you get a close-up look...

1207
01:38:02,209 --> 01:38:05,011
at some writhing
micro-cooties.

1208
01:38:05,145 --> 01:38:08,882
But a trout stream...

1209
01:38:09,016 --> 01:38:11,484
is only a trout stream...

1210
01:38:11,619 --> 01:38:15,288
when it's flowing
between its own two banks...

1211
01:38:15,422 --> 01:38:18,658
at its own pace...

1212
01:38:18,792 --> 01:38:21,294
in its own sweet way.

1213
01:38:40,281 --> 01:38:42,148
Run run river

1214
01:38:42,283 --> 01:38:46,419
♫ Carry me to my home
In the ocean ♫

1215
01:38:46,553 --> 01:38:49,656
♫ Carry me away ♫

1216
01:38:52,026 --> 01:38:54,060
♫ I know I have a home ♫

1217
01:38:54,194 --> 01:38:58,064
♫ Somewhere far and removed
Like the stars ♫

1218
01:38:58,198 --> 01:39:02,302
♫ That make you feeI
Like you got friends ♫

1219
01:39:02,436 --> 01:39:05,838
♫ Stars'll make you feeI ♫

1220
01:39:05,973 --> 01:39:09,676
♫ Like you got friends ♫

1221
01:39:38,439 --> 01:39:40,640
♫ Follow the empty valley ♫

1222
01:39:40,774 --> 01:39:44,944
♫ Past the hills To the
marshes Of the estuary ♫

1223
01:39:45,079 --> 01:39:50,450
♫ Come in peacefuI
river ♫

1224
01:39:50,584 --> 01:39:52,719
♫ In the light of the moon ♫

1225
01:39:52,853 --> 01:39:55,021
♫ With the river I do run ♫

1226
01:39:55,155 --> 01:39:59,959
♫ In the hope that one day
I will dive ♫

1227
01:40:00,094 --> 01:40:03,896
♫ Beneath the ocean ♫

1228
01:40:06,200 --> 01:40:10,970
♫♫ And that this river
Will forever run ♫♫

1229
01:40:54,982 --> 01:40:58,284
♫ Bet you're going fishing
All of the time ♫
