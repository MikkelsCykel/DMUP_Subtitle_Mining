1
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,800
I think I'm gonna die.

2
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,600
You wanted a birthday party.

3
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,240
What's that old expression?

4
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,720
- "Never mix bourbon with champagne"?
- No.

5
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,000
"Jews can't drink."

6
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,640
Honey, how about I take the boys to school?

7
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,560
Bless you.

8
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,240
Where we goin'?
To Daddy's office!

9
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,280
- Who wants Daddy's briefcase?
- Me, me, me!

10
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,520
Run to the car. Run to the car.

11
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,120
Oh, watch yourself.

12
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,920
- Bye, Mommy, I love you!
- Say bye to Mommy.

13
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,760
- Bye, Mommy!
- Bye. Be good, boys.

14
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,760
- Love you.
- I love you too.

15
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,640
OK, let's go to work.

16
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:54,120
Get in there!
Get in that car!

17
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,760
Get in that car! You get in that car!

18
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,040
OK, sit down, boys.

19
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:06,200
- Here we go.
- Daddy's office!

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,160
Bye. See you when we come back today!

21
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,000
Hey, Mr Kramer.

22
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:46,120
Daddy's office! Daddy's office!

23
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,600
Everybody out.

24
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,200
Close that door. That a boy.

25
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,520
OK, everybody in.

26
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:03,640
- Do we have to go in there?
- You gotta go all the way.

27
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,920
All the way in.

28
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,040
Hey, big stinky earplug!

29
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,400
Hey, big stinky man!

30
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,320
<i>Who is it?</i>

31
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,600
<i>So far, all that's been recovered
are the bodies of two children,</i>

32
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,720
<i>their identity unknown.</i>

33
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:07,040
<i>Amen. The service is now completed.</i>

34
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,320
<i>God damn you!</i>

35
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,680
<i>You're murderers!
You're filthy murderers! And you know it!</i>

36
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,880
<i>You're murderers, all of you!</i>

37
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:45,000
<i>Can you tell us why you did it?</i>

38
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:55,120
<i>You killed my boys!
You killed my boys!</i>

39
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:59,160
<i>You murderer! You filthy murderer!</i>

40
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,480
<i>You killed my boys, Cayhall!</i>

41
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,720
- Have you lost your mind?
- No, I'm very serious.

42
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,880
I want the Cayhall case.

43
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,200
What do you know
about the death penalty?

44
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,240
I've read everything there is.

45
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,600
Then you know nothing.

46
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,800
I know you took Sam Cayhall pro bono
and kept him alive all these years.

47
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,960
I also know that he just won
the right to fire you.

48
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,640
Do you mind telling me how you know that?

49
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,080
I made it my business.

50
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:47,600
And do you know the reason
why he fired me?

51
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,880
He hates lawyers.

52
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,480
Then why in the world would he hire you?

53
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,520
Go back to your office, Mr Hall.
We both have better things to do.

54
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:08,400
Sam Cayhall's my grandfather.

55
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,520
You have a relationship with Williams
and Cook in Jackson. I could work there.

56
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:27,000
You have great contacts at Parchman
Prison. A word there would help too.

57
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,400
I take it Hall is not your real name?

58
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,240
My parents changed it from Cayhall
after the murders.

59
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,480
- You still have family down there?
- An aunt in Jackson.

60
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,120
I told her I might be down on business.

61
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,440
Does she know what this business is?

62
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,560
I'll tell her when I get there.

63
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,120
You Cayhalls are big on secrets.

64
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,120
- Did you ever meet your grandfather?
- No.

65
00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:00,120
- Did they even tell you he existed?
- I found out at my dad's funeral in 1980.

66
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,400
- Same year Sam was sentenced to die.
- Yes, sir.

67
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:10,240
- Your father must have died young.
- 35 years, four months, six days.

68
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,040
Perhaps I shouldn't have asked.

69
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,520
It's not a big deal.

70
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:23,320
I was 52 years old
the first time I handled a death row case.

71
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,840
I didn't sleep for a week afterwards.

72
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,920
I don't sleep as it is.

73
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,880
You'll open up passions
no one wants uncovered.

74
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,280
For a brief moment, Sam Cayhall will be
the most talked-about man in the nation.

75
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,680
I've been living with this case my whole life.

76
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,040
- To do so officially might be a relief.
- The odds of winning are a joke.

77
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,360
You don't have a chance in hell.

78
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:51,920
I'm going, Mr Goodman,
with or without your help.

79
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,520
Call me from Jackson. Don't thank me.
I have not done you a favour.

80
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,680
Did he do it?

81
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,440
Oh, he did it.
There's no question that he did it.

82
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:22,320
<i>The Mississippi Scenic Cruiser
for downtown Jackson</i>

83
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,560
<i>is now boarding in the blue zone.</i>

84
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,280
Good afternoon, sir. Good to see you.

85
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:36,400
You look like a mendicant Indian.

86
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,840
Jessie, help Mr Hall with his...

87
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:46,320
Actually, I'm going to stay
at a hotel near the courts.

88
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,360
I'll be up all night working long hours.

89
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,240
Honey, whatever you like.
I love you, you hear?

90
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,120
Go freshen up and hurry down -

91
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:58,920
I have the mothers of the only
12 remaining virgins in all of Jackson,

92
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,080
just panting to meet you.

93
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,400
I won't have too much time
for socialising.

94
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:07,240
You must regale us all
with tales of what brings you here.

95
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,240
I'm guessing it's to use
your lawyerly charms

96
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,320
to separate our local fat cats
from their ill-gotten fortunes.

97
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,760
You should start
with my cranky old husband.

98
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,200
He deserves a good comeuppance.

99
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,640
- Lee...
- Yes?

100
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,200
I'm here to defend your father.

101
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,800
- Look, I understand that...
- You understand nothing.

102
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,040
Don't you utter one word to anyone.

103
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,200
- Lee...
- Not one word.

104
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,800
You hear?

105
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,400
Good night.

106
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,240
- Call me tomorrow.
- I will.

107
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,160
See you. Bye.

108
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,600
- Lovely party, dear.
- Oh, thank you.

109
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,720
Don't forget
we have the museum on Thursday.

110
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:17,160
- Good night, Adam.
- Good night.

111
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,560
Good luck.

112
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,720
Phelps lives in town.

113
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:29,000
Oh, it's OK. We have
a very active romantic life.

114
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,840
Just not with each other.

115
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,520
Then why stay married?

116
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,640
Good for a banker to have someone
acceptable for social occasions.

117
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,680
And it's good for you to have a banker?

118
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,080
I've done pretty well
for poor white trash.

119
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,880
Don't you think?

120
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,280
Not bad. Not bad at all.

121
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,120
How acceptable I'm gonna be

122
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:55,240
when the world finds out
I'm Hitler's daughter is another question.

123
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,040
It's all right. It's under control.

124
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,400
Nobody knows?

125
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,880
I was speaking of my drinking.

126
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,360
But no, no one knows.

127
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:11,400
I left home when I was 18,
changed my name, met Phelps, eloped.

128
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,480
We told his family my father was dead.

129
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,440
Soon, that won't be a lie.

130
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:21,600
You talk about Sam
like he means nothing to you.

131
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:30,880
Occasionally, if I'm having a good day
and the sun is shining...

132
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,720
I might think of him and remember some
pleasant moment from my earliest days -

133
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,400
the way he'd call me "sweet baby girl".

134
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:41,880
But mostly I remember
how he destroyed absolutely everyone

135
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,840
who made the mistake
of getting close to him.

136
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,320
He'll do it to you too, you know.

137
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:55,480
Be very careful dredging the past, Adam.

138
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,160
You might not like what comes up.

139
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,440
I'm here to see Sam Cayhall.

140
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,720
Briefcase.

141
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,720
Spread your legs, please.

142
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,400
- Sergeant Packer.
- Adam Hall.

143
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,880
This way, please.

144
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,040
Not a good day to see Sam.

145
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,720
- Why's that?
- Prison attorney just called.

146
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,720
Judge ruled - he dies in 28 days.

147
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,800
I'll get Sam.

148
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,760
This way.

149
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:21,040
Catch up.

150
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,680
I'm going to lock this door.
Sam will be in in a minute.

151
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,080
Thanks.

152
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,680
Move on.

153
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,600
Get out!

154
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,560
- Who the hell are you?
- Adam Hall.

155
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,680
I'm a lawyer
with Kravitz and Bane, Chicago.

156
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,360
You Jew-boys never quit, do you?

157
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,680
I'm not Jewish.

158
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,320
How can you work for Kravitz and Bane?

159
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:20,560
- We're an equal opportunity employer.
- Really?

160
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,720
I know you've got
about 150 partners up there.

161
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,640
How many of them are women?

162
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,000
I don't really know, maybe a dozen.

163
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,560
Oh, so you've got less than 10% women.

164
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,960
How many nigger partners you got?

165
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:39,720
- We've four African-American partners.
- Oh, that's nice.

166
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:43,200
How many Jewish-American
partners you got? About 80%?

167
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,920
- It makes no difference to me.
- It makes a big difference to me.

168
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,640
I was always embarrassed
to be represented by such blatant bigots.

169
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:55,360
Well, I think a lot of people
would probably find it appropriate.

170
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,800
- Why are you so nervous?
- I'm not.

171
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,480
You afraid I'm gonna
come through that screen and get you?

172
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,760
How many death penalty cases
have you handled?

173
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,480
- This is my first.
- Oh, great.

174
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,200
That Jew bastard
sent a greenhorn to save me.

175
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:15,360
I killed some of their people
and now they want to kill me.

176
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,600
I always expected it.

177
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,640
You admit you killed the Kramer kids?

178
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,400
Now, who the hell are you
to ask me a question like that?

179
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,920
The jury said I did it.
The appeals court said the jury was right.

180
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:30,080
That's all that matters.

181
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,000
How old are you there, Mr Hall?

182
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,640
26. I'd like to go over
your legal position...

183
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,400
- Born in '69?
- That's correct.

184
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,640
- Your legal position...
- Where?

185
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,960
- In Memphis. I'd prefer to stick to...
- Grew up there, did you?

186
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,680
I grew up in a lot of places,
mainly southern California.

187
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,600
Your family still there?

188
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,320
Mom's remarried, she lives in Portland.

189
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,880
And your sister?

190
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,120
I believe her name would be Carmen.

191
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:10,040
College. Berkeley.

192
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,760
How did you know?

193
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,640
The voice.

194
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,760
You sound just like your daddy.

195
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,160
Why did you come here?

196
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,720
He sent me.

197
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,680
I don't have a choice.
But I am going to save you.

198
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,360
- Save me?
- Yeah.

199
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,760
This from the son of a man
that blew his own brains out?

200
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,080
Go to hell, you little piece of shit.

201
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,640
You know who you're talking to?
Save me?

202
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:48,600
You don't look like you could save
a turkey from Thanksgiving.

203
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,560
Go on, get the hell out of here.
Try to save your own sorry ass.

204
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,640
I am the only person on earth
who cares if you live or die.

205
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:01,720
You will sign this and agree to be
my client or you will be dead in 28 days.

206
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:14,320
We're all a bit taken aback at how huge
this case has suddenly become.

207
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,480
What's so huge about it?

208
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:20,080
I know the Clarion-Ledger
is not the Chicago Tribune,

209
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:24,440
but in our small pond, it's everything.

210
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,480
I'm lost.

211
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,800
Certainly you've seen today's paper?

212
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,760
Thanks very much,
this will be just fine.

213
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:47,840
Let us know if we can do
anything more for you.

214
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:06,240
Why do you want the right to end
my representation without a fight?

215
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:10,280
It took me a long time to fire
those Jew bastards last time.

216
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,920
I don't want to go through that again.

217
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:17,320
- That's reasonable.
- I don't care if you think so or not.

218
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:23,080
It's in the agreement
and it's non-negotiable.

219
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,560
Moving right along.

220
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,960
"No clemency" is ridiculous.

221
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:32,160
If the appeal fails, we'll have to go to
Governor McAllister as a last resort.

222
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,520
To preclude clemency would be suicidal.

223
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,040
If I could take David McAllister
into the chamber with me,

224
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,960
I'd die with a smile.

225
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,680
I was tried, I was retried,
I got a hung jury both times.

226
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,920
I was a free man for 12 years.

227
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,600
And then that sleazy
son of a bitch McAllister

228
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:55,160
used me to get hisself elected.

229
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,680
No deals with the governor.

230
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,640
Fine.

231
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,920
All right.

232
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:17,200
Why did you become a Klansman?

233
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:20,920
- Because my daddy was in the Klan.
- Why did he become a Klansman?

234
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:25,400
- His daddy was in the Klan.
- Great. Three generations?

235
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:31,000
No, four. Colonel Jacob Cayhall fought
with Nathan Bedford Forrest in the war.

236
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,120
And family legend has it that he was
one of the first members of the Klan.

237
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:41,240
So, let me see. I guess that makes him
your great-great-great-granddaddy.

238
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,760
- Do you expect me to feel proud about it?
- I don't give a damn.

239
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:50,800
I'm just telling you who you are.
Isn't that why you're here?

240
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,200
The Kramer twins was the fifth bombing.

241
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,120
What about the Jackson real estate office?

242
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,840
I lost my virginity on that one.
It was crude - just some sticks and a fuse.

243
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,720
- The newspaper office?
- Real fireball.

244
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,480
- The Hirsch Temple?
- Best one yet.

245
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,800
The Kramer office?

246
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,640
It was a good bomb.

247
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,560
- But I never meant to kill anybody.
- Really?

248
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,800
You bombed the Pinder house at 4 a.m.,
with six people there.

249
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:24,120
But nobody got hurt
because I put the bomb in the garage.

250
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,800
I don't make fancy bombs.
They're simple little things.

251
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:31,520
But I know where to put them.
I never meant to kill anybody.

252
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,200
And the twins?

253
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:41,560
- Casualties of war.
- The father losing his legs?

254
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:44,720
- Killing himself?
- I don't want to talk about this.

255
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,200
Are you hiding something from me?

256
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:50,360
- I wouldn't advise it.
- I got nothing to hide.

257
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,920
I did what I had to do.
The Klan was at war.

258
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,760
We would've won,
but we started bombing the Jews

259
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,400
and with all their money
they got the FBI and they beat us.

260
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:03,160
We should've just stayed
whipping up on the niggers.

261
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,520
World would've been a different place.

262
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,240
You can pretend
you're all offended by this.

263
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:13,800
But, deep down inside, we both know
there's a part of you that agrees with me.

264
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,800
That's bullshit.

265
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,240
Why are you getting so touchy?

266
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,720
- What are you hiding?
- I'm not hiding a thing.

267
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,200
Like hell you're not.

268
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,960
You're driving your car
and some drunk jungle bunny cuts you off,

269
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,440
his ghetto music blastin',
what do you think?

270
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,200
"Well, you darned African-American!"

271
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,800
No. You think, "Nigger."

272
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,440
If you had any guts, you'd say so.

273
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,760
I'm gonna come back tomorrow.

274
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,280
I hurt your little feelings, have I?

275
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,520
What did you expect to find here?

276
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,520
Old Grandpa Do-Good?
Expect me to go all blubbery,

277
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,440
kiss your behind
and sing psalms of forgiveness?

278
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,160
I don't know what I expected.

279
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:07,240
Sure you did... grandson.

280
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,640
Hi. I'm Nora Stark, Attorney Hall.

281
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,360
I kind of clean up
after Governor McAllister.

282
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,960
- Adam, please.
- Adam it shall be.

283
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,680
I'm very curious.

284
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:39,800
You know the same points raised in
the pending ineffective counsel petition

285
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,560
were turned down by Texas just last month?

286
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,880
Actually, I do know. But it's my opinion

287
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
that Texas is miles ahead of Mississippi
in many things, including stupidity.

288
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,880
I'm optimistic.

289
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,840
- Morning, Counsel.
- Morning, Your Honour.

290
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,920
This is a serious business.

291
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:03,880
Ultimate, irreversible punishment
of a fellow human.

292
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,520
Time is the purest gold.

293
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,160
When do you plan to file an appeal?

294
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,160
Oddly, I had planned on waiting

295
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:18,440
for the court to issue a ruling
before appealing it,

296
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,080
Your Honour.

297
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:26,560
However, if, as expected... Thursday?

298
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,560
- And the State's response?
- We agree.

299
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:36,480
Assuming you'll not be introducing
additional issues on this appeal...

300
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,480
Obviously not.

301
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,120
...Friday morning.

302
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,720
You'll have my decision Friday.

303
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:49,600
Can the court expect additional filings?

304
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:53,280
Are you asking me
my legal strategy, Your Honour?

305
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,320
Not at all, sir.

306
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,680
But I'm thrilled to know you have one.

307
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,320
Y'all are dismissed. Now.

308
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,480
Carl, Irene, how are you?

309
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,720
Adam!

310
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,600
Clemency?

311
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,640
Contractually bound not to ask.

312
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,880
You haven't, but you will.

313
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,880
You see, the governor's
a very open-minded man.

314
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,160
He's not precluding anything.

315
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,600
You becoming a lawyer
must have made Sam proud.

316
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,160
You should be familiar
with his view of the profession.

317
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:30,800
I'd just as soon keep this discussion
on the issue and off the record.

318
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:35,080
I believe you're reconsidering
the state-sanctioned murder of my client.

319
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,280
- Adam, would you mind?
- No, sir.

320
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,240
I am obviously extremely proud
to have won a conviction

321
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:45,400
where two previous prosecutors have failed.

322
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,240
While I have no doubt
Sam Cayhall is guilty as charged,

323
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,160
I've always doubted he acted alone

324
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:55,880
and as you know, he's never been inclined
to help himself in that regard.

325
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,360
What exactly are you saying?

326
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,720
- Is there something specific you know?
- No, certainly not.

327
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:06,240
I just wanna make sure justice is served.

328
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,120
I see.

329
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,640
So, if I should somehow learn...

330
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,960
Adam, I take my power to decide

331
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:18,040
whether a fellow human
should live or die very seriously.

332
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:22,280
If I could somehow be convinced
your client felt the same way...

333
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:26,240
I'm sorry to rush. Nora,
help out Mr Hall in every way we can.

334
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:31,320
- It was lovely to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

335
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:36,400
Let me guess.
You're not convinced he's sincere.

336
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:39,440
- Allow me a touch of healthy scepticism.
- Of course.

337
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,880
However, off the record and on the issue,

338
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,160
you're being given the opportunity
to provide the governor with cover.

339
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:49,800
- I love politics.
- If he stays the execution for no reason,

340
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:54,320
to the left he's a friend of the old guard,
and to the right he's soft on crime.

341
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:57,400
And as it was he who won the conviction,

342
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,440
he looks to the world like a flip-flop.

343
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:02,920
But if I come up with something,
he can follow his conscience.

344
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,560
Let's just say it expands his options.

345
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:08,120
So you've been assigned
my new best friend.

346
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,480
Something like that.

347
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,280
- I'll win this in the courts.
- Even better.

348
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,440
- It's not getting to the governor.
- Now you're talking.

349
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:20,400
If you need any help,
that's home, that's office.

350
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:23,440
Call me.

351
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,680
I found this in my motel room last night.

352
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:17,840
"Welcome to Dixie. Please try
and leave everything as you found it."

353
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:25,000
- Sounds like good manners to me.
- It was attached to a fake bomb.

354
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:31,360
What?

355
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:36,280
- What do you think I should do about it?
- I don't give a damn.

356
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,440
I'm thinking about how
that gas I'll be forced to sniff

357
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:44,160
makes your lungs explode
and come flying out your mouth.

358
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,000
What motions are you planning to file?

359
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:56,040
We're going to pursue cruel and unusual.

360
00:29:56,160 --> 00:30:00,000
Three years at Michigan Law
and that's the best you got?

361
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,320
In 1984, Mississippi passed a law

362
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:05,440
changing executions
from gas chamber to lethal injection.

363
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:10,480
That law applies to folks sentenced
after nineteen hundred and eighty-four.

364
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,360
I was sent up here
in nineteen hundred and eighty.

365
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,960
- Now, what's your point?
- You're up on the law, aren't you?

366
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:21,600
I read all the decisions
of all the dead judges. Same as you.

367
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,880
I write some writs for guys on the row.

368
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,520
You got any stays yet?

369
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,920
Then keep your matchbook
law school advice to yourself.

370
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:33,040
By changing to lethal injection
the state admitted de facto

371
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,680
that the gas chamber is a cruel execution.

372
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,880
May I remind Counsel,
speaking as the gasee,

373
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,360
I'll be just as dead one way as the other.

374
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:44,400
Sooner or later, yeah,
but I'll take later as a win.

375
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:48,720
Well, I've been losing
better appeals than this for 16 years.

376
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:54,880
I feel like those white guys that always lose
to the nigger Globetrotters.

377
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,880
Why didn't my dad
get infected with this crap?

378
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,800
We're having our Eddie talk,
is that it? Be careful.

379
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:04,280
You destroyed him, you must like that.

380
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:08,760
I destroyed nothing.
He never tried to understand the Klan.

381
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,280
- We were right.
- You still think so?

382
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:14,520
Look what you got now -
AIDS, drugs, bastard children.

383
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,360
- Killer bees.
- Well, they come from Africa!

384
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:20,640
- South America. Close enough?
- Why are you doing this?

385
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:23,960
Cos my life would be a lot easier
if I could just hate you.

386
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,760
But you can't, can you? I'm just too lovable.

387
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:31,840
Well, I'm working on it. Your father kills
himself in front of you when you're ten,

388
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:35,280
then at the funeral you find out
Grandpa's still alive - great!

389
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:39,080
Except he's a racist scumbag baby-killer.
Why is that not comforting?

390
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,600
Oh, stop, you're breaking my heart.

391
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:48,360
It was your hate
that drove him away, wasn't it?

392
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:51,760
Eddie was weak.

393
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,040
I never laid a hand on him.

394
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,680
Never got after him.

395
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:01,840
Never cared who his friends were.
Not even Quince.

396
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,560
Who?

397
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:08,320
Quince Lincoln,
a nigger kid Eddie used to play with.

398
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,880
- I've heard that name before.
- It's nothing.

399
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,840
No, he used to mention that name,
he'd have these spells...

400
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,160
- Sergeant Packer!
- ...he'd mumble some story...

401
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,920
It don't mean nothing. Shut up about it.

402
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:26,040
- Who's Quince?
- It don't mean nothing! Shut up about it!

403
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,760
Let's go, Sam.

404
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,640
Come on.

405
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,600
- Yep?
- Were you asleep?

406
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,120
No, I'm up.

407
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:47,760
The court's going to reject
ineffective counsel.

408
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,480
Yeah, I expected that.

409
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:54,240
I'll be ready to file the appeal in
New Orleans when the court here rules.

410
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:59,080
<i>I'll expect your first draft
in the morning. Good night.</i>

411
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,880
<i>- Hello?
- Nora?</i>

412
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,480
Hi.

413
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,800
Does the offer to help still stand?

414
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,760
<i>Sure.</i>

415
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:29,800
I need to track down the FBI agent
who was in charge of Sam's case.

416
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,080
Sam was of no concern to us,
you understand?

417
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:38,440
He wasn't active in the really nasty stuff
so we didn't track him.

418
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,440
When did that change?

419
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:45,920
When the civil rights workers disappeared,
Hoover sent us in.

420
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,960
We spread money all over the place.

421
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,720
Those people were basically
ignorant rednecks, you know?

422
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:55,400
Didn't have a dime, so we preyed on
their craving for money.

423
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:58,560
Go on.

424
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:02,240
There's things I can talk about
and things I can't talk about.

425
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:07,080
And some things I won't talk about
cos I don't like you lawyers twisting the truth,

426
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,120
getting killers off
on some legal technicality.

427
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,320
That's bullshit.

428
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:15,280
Besides, it's too late
for new information, kid.

429
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:18,040
Courts won't hear it, you know that.

430
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:21,000
Courts don't have
the final say in this case.

431
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,840
You said he wasn't involved
in the really nasty stuff.

432
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:28,280
- He didn't mean to kill.
- Of course he meant to kill.

433
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,240
Marvin Kramer was a creature of habit.

434
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:34,680
He was in that office every morning
before eight o'clock.

435
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,320
The bomb went off straight up at eight.

436
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,120
The timer was set for eight.

437
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:47,000
- That was never introduced to trial.
- I can't help that, it was in our report.

438
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:51,280
- I'd like to see that report.
- I can't help you, pal.

439
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:56,160
I'm just a fisherman now...
who'd just as soon see him gassed.

440
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:00,040
I've been around those violent assholes
all my life.

441
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,680
Let them taste the other end of violence.

442
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,480
See how brave they are without their hoods.

443
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,840
You know what I'm talking about.

444
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:17,360
Why would our FBI friend not wanna
tell us about a 30-year-old case?

445
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:20,480
Cos you're in Mississippi now,
land of secrets.

446
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,200
There are bodies buried everywhere.

447
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:28,160
But no one's hiding anything -
they don't have to, Sam did it.

448
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:32,400
They just don't want you looking because
they're not sure what might turn up.

449
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:36,040
- Who is "they"?
- Everyone.

450
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:40,600
- No one. What's the difference?
- Well, maybe a lot.

451
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,960
Take you, for instance,
are you really here to help me?

452
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:48,480
Or did they assign you to spy on me?

453
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:57,240
You ever heard of
the Sovereignty Commission?

454
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:00,160
- Vaguely.
- It doesn't exist any more.

455
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:03,320
It started in the '50s.
It was an official state agency

456
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:07,040
dedicated to states' rights,
i.e. Fighting civil rights.

457
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:10,440
Some people think it coordinated
the White Citizens' Councils.

458
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,160
- What were those?
- Every town had one.

459
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,440
A local group of respectable white people.

460
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,480
Professional types.

461
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:23,320
Pillars of their community...
who told the Klan what to do.

462
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,760
So somebody like Sam
wasn't making decisions?

463
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,280
Like our FBI friend said,

464
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:35,040
they were poor, uneducated bigots
who couldn't find their butts with a map.

465
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:38,200
The Citizens' Councils used them
to do their dirty work.

466
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:43,200
- And the Sovereignty Commission?
- Kept the records.

467
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,360
- Please sign this.
- I ain't signing nothing.

468
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:50,000
The files are sealed by the state legislature.

469
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:54,040
As a defendant, only you can apply
to have your files opened.

470
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,720
You're set to die in 20 days,
this might help.

471
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,640
- Help him maybe, not me.
- Help who?

472
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,760
The governor, you dumbass.
Can't you see it?

473
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:07,200
He can't open the files so he gets you
to do it for him. To help me?

474
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,400
No, he put me here.

475
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:14,400
No, he's just fishing
for political dirt on his enemies.

476
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:18,200
What's in those files, Sam?

477
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:22,800
Nothing for you. Stuff they'd twist around
and use to hurt my people.

478
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:27,160
I'm your people. Don't you get it? I am.

479
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:31,680
You ain't my real people,
you ain't never met my real people.

480
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,240
I don't know how they got the story.

481
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:39,960
<i>It's only a matter of time
before they get around to me.</i>

482
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:43,640
I am sorry, but listen,
I think I might be onto something.

483
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,120
- Some leads from way back.
- Adam, leave it alone.

484
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:50,400
Lee, I really think I can save him.

485
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,880
Ever occur to you
he might not be worth saving?

486
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,280
You can't mean that.

487
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,360
All right, Adam,
you wanna know about the past?

488
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:04,200
I'll tell you about the past.

489
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:20,720
This was my tree.

490
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:29,960
My own laurel tree.

491
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:36,320
I was up there.

492
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,680
Your father was there...

493
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,360
with Quince.

494
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:50,440
They were eight, maybe nine.
And they were best friends.

495
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,040
They were fighting, and they made
so much noise Daddy heard

496
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:02,760
and come out to see
what all the ruckus was.

497
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,120
Go on, go on! Get away home!

498
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:09,640
Quince's father did day work for Daddy.

499
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,320
His name was Joe.

500
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,240
Daddy never was very handy
at mechanical things

501
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,720
so Joe fixed things for us, made things.

502
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:19,640
He was here, all the time.

503
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:24,200
So then Quince came back with his father.

504
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,480
My boy says you been beatin' on him.

505
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:30,640
They fought so hard, like animals.

506
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:36,480
At one point Daddy grabbed the rake...
and things got out of hand.

507
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:40,320
He knocked Joe over, Joe fell to the ground,

508
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:43,400
and he yelled for Quince to get his shotgun.

509
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:48,280
- Quince, get my shotgun!
- Sam told Eddie to get his. Eddie froze.

510
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,480
But Daddy made him go.

511
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:55,400
Joe was here.

512
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,120
Daddy was there.

513
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,640
Get in the house.

514
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,320
<i>- Joe waited for his gun.
- Get!</i>

515
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:05,120
He kept looking around.

516
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:07,440
Sam had his.

517
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:12,120
And then my dear, sweet father...

518
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:37,520
This was Mississippi...

519
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,560
in the early '50s.

520
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,320
Daddy said self-defence.

521
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:49,480
He was never even so much as arrested.

522
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:54,360
What were my dad and Quince
fighting about?

523
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,600
A toy soldier.

524
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:03,640
<i>Eddie thought Quince had stolen it.</i>

525
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,240
<i>And that night he found it under his bed.</i>

526
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:12,000
He took the weight of the world
on his shoulders.

527
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:15,200
And then he said

528
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:20,080
I had killed Joe Lincoln too.

529
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:29,640
Said if I had cried out for Daddy to stop...

530
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:33,600
no way would he have fired.

531
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:37,600
Not with his sweet baby girl watching.

532
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:44,240
Course, he was right.

533
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,880
It was my fault too.

534
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,960
<i>Get away home.</i>

535
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,360
<i>Daddy never was very handy
at mechanical things...</i>

536
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:38,080
Jesus.

537
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:45,560
The superintendent asked
if you'd thought about your last meal.

538
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:48,760
Special requests can take time.

539
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:54,680
Yeah, I want a bowl of Eskimo Pies
and French Market coffee.

540
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,360
It shall be done.

541
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:02,400
There's been five executions here -
you know of any problems with them?

542
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:07,000
Come on. They all died within 50 feet of me.

543
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:10,080
Everybody on the row knows
about every killing.

544
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:14,200
Tell me about Teddy Meeks, then.
Every detail.

545
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:20,640
They didn't know what they were doing.
Everything went wrong.

546
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:24,080
- Have you seen the chamber?
- Not yet.

547
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:26,760
There's a little room
where the executioner goes

548
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:31,360
to mix up his solution of sulphuric acid.

549
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:35,480
With Meeks, the executioner was drunk.

550
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:38,480
- Come on.
- He was drunk.

551
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:42,200
Anyway...

552
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:47,080
his first batch of brew didn't work.

553
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:50,320
Meeks held his breath
for as long as he could,

554
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:53,480
then he inhaled and nothing happened.

555
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:57,360
So they waited.
Meeks waited, the witnesses waited.

556
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:01,600
Slowly they turned toward
the executioner - who's waiting.

557
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:03,200
And cussing.

558
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:06,800
He finally goes back
and he mixes up another batch.

559
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:11,680
He pulls the lever and the acid drops down
where it's supposed to.

560
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:15,680
He pulls the second lever
that drops in the cyanide pellets.

561
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:20,240
Sure enough this gas
starts drifting upward...

562
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:24,480
to where old Teddy
is holding his breath again.

563
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:30,680
Then he finally...
He sucks in a whole noseful of it

564
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:34,000
and starts shaking and jerking.

565
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:41,280
There's a metal pole that runs from
the top of the chamber down to the bottom

566
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:44,120
and it's directly behind the chair.

567
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:47,040
And...

568
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:56,280
And just about the time Meeks got real still

569
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,840
and everybody thought he was dead

570
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:02,040
his head starts banging
back and forth against that pole.

571
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:05,880
Just beating the hell out of it, like that.

572
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,560
His eyes were rolled up in his head,

573
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:13,520
and his lips opened up real wide
and he was foaming at the mouth.

574
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:16,560
And there he was...

575
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:21,600
just banging the back of his head
against that pole.

576
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:26,520
It was sick.

577
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:29,160
How long did it take them to kill him?

578
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:34,600
According to the prison doctor,
death was instant and painless.

579
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:38,440
Packer told me it was the longest
five minutes of his life.

580
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:43,640
The guy convulsed and heaved
and pounded his skull for so long

581
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:48,000
that pieces of his brain
was flying out the top of his head.

582
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:05,920
How does this lever they pull
activate the cyanide canister?

583
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:09,520
- What?
- The lever! Is it hinges? Springs?

584
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:12,000
- I don't know.
- Is it just gravity?

585
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:14,040
How the hell would I know that?

586
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,680
Just thought you had an aptitude for this.

587
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,120
Well, sue me.

588
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:22,680
- I'm not mechanical.
- That's what Lee said.

589
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,840
But you were handy enough to build
a bomb to kill the Kramers.

590
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:28,720
Son of a bitch. Is that what this is all about?

591
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:33,040
You must have stayed up
all night thinking of this one.

592
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:34,880
Sorry, bubba.

593
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:39,360
Hate to disappoint you
but bombs ain't that complicated.

594
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:42,000
It can't be that easy - I couldn't do it.

595
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:44,400
That's because you're not motivated.

596
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:47,240
By the time I did Kramer
I had it down real simple.

597
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:51,280
So just because you're an anti-Semite
you can build a bomb,

598
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:55,040
place it on the second floor,
light a fuse and get out with no risk?

599
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:58,240
Plenty of risk. Not much glory.

600
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:02,000
It was the first floor.
Bomb went off below 'em.

601
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:04,120
- Check the FBI report.
- I did.

602
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:08,080
- What did it say?
- Bomb went off below 'em.

603
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:11,600
Thank you.
Anything else I can help you with?

604
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:15,000
- How long was the fuse?
- For Pete's sake...

605
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:18,240
It happened a long time ago,
I'm an old man.

606
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:20,560
Get off my back here, will you?

607
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:23,720
I'm sure you can remember
killing two children.

608
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:26,840
Long enough for me
to get the hell out of there, OK?

609
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:31,400
Except for one thing - the bomb
didn't have a fuse, it had a timer.

610
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:36,240
- What are you saying?
- You weren't alone.

611
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:40,040
There's not a chance
you could have built a timing device.

612
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,680
The FBI searched your house, your garage,

613
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:46,440
and didn't find a single trace
of explosives anywhere.

614
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:49,360
Maybe they're stupid.

615
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:53,160
Maybe I was real careful
and didn't leave a trail.

616
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:56,360
Maybe someone else planted the bomb.

617
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:06,240
You have no idea what you're doing.

618
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:11,200
Just hear me out.
Sam couldn't construct a timer.

619
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:14,320
His bombs were crude,
they had fuses. This was different.

620
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:17,880
It was complex for back then,
it was timed to kill.

621
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,640
- OK, wait a minute...
- Sam did not plant that bomb.

622
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:24,920
Wait!

623
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:31,880
The Sovereignty Commission file on
Sam might say who made the decisions.

624
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,400
Adam, just stop this, OK?
Those files are sealed.

625
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:39,040
If your client won't sign,
you cannot move the court to unseal them.

626
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:41,800
- I bet you could get a peek at them.
- No.

627
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:44,240
- You wanted to help me.
- I am helping you.

628
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:47,880
- Maybe you need to do more.
- Well, maybe I can't!

629
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,920
If there's others
and you're involved in protecting them...

630
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:55,880
Are you threatening me?

631
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,520
I am pursuing the truth
by any means necessary.

632
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:08,760
Which includes politely asking for your help.

633
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:16,880
In addition to appealing cruel and unusual,

634
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,480
- I want to file a new motion.
- About time you focused on the law, bubba.

635
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,920
I never stopped, bubba.

636
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:26,440
But there is nothing I will not pursue
in order to get a stay,

637
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:28,280
including proving you're insane.

638
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,640
- I'm insane?
- That's right.

639
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:33,480
As a product of three generations
of Klan mentality

640
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:37,840
your indoctrination
into a world of hate born of irrational fear

641
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:41,840
resulted in diminished mental capacity
to determine right from wrong.

642
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:45,880
You're gonna argue I'm insane
because I held different political beliefs

643
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,760
than you and your father

644
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:51,600
and his naive, nigger-loving,
bleeding heart bullshit?

645
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:55,760
I probably won't use
those exact words in my brief.

646
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,120
I'll wait for the psychiatrist's report.

647
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,760
So I'm gonna see a psychiatrist?

648
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:03,320
- That's right.
- That's insane.

649
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:08,760
Killing children whose father was working
for civil rights is insane.

650
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,960
I never meant to kill those kids.

651
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:16,280
That's fine but you're scheduled
to be executed for it in 14 days.

652
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:23,600
OK.

653
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:26,640
Good.

654
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:30,880
I need to go over more family background.

655
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:35,520
I got some from Lee
but there's a lot of holes in it.

656
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,560
She's going through a tough time right now.

657
00:51:55,800 --> 00:52:00,080
I tried to call her when I saw this
but she didn't answer.

658
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:05,040
I think she's drinking again.

659
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:10,120
Did you know she's an alcoholic?

660
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:19,760
Have you ever felt feelings of remorse
for any of your crimes?

661
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:22,680
No.

662
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:27,400
Have you ever apologised
to your victims' family?

663
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:32,320
No, what would be the point?

664
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:37,200
What do you think would be the point?

665
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:40,160
No point.

666
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:10,360
Packer.

667
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:15,440
I want you to know that
when I talk about your people I...

668
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,200
Well...

669
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:24,520
I hear you, Sam.

670
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:47,680
<i>In your professional opinion,
does Sam Cayhall have a conscience?</i>

671
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:49,760
I found no evidence of one.

672
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:53,200
Dr Biddows,
is Sam Cayhall in touch with reality?

673
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:54,800
No, he is not.

674
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:59,920
Thank you, Dr Biddows.
No further questions, Your Honour.

675
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:03,120
What sayeth the state?

676
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:06,440
The state calls Sergeant Clyde Packer.

677
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:14,840
Sergeant, inform us how long you have
held your present position, please.

678
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:19,120
Been running the row for 15 years, sir.
Sam's been with me the whole time.

679
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:23,560
During this time have you ever observed
Mr Cayhall demonstrate

680
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:28,080
he might have a conscience
or care about other people's feelings?

681
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:29,920
Oh, yes, sir. Everybody knows

682
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:33,200
Sam has a real bad attitude
toward black folk.

683
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:37,280
But the other night he told me,
when he says stuff like that...

684
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:40,880
Let's just say he tried to apologise,
and he didn't even get it all out.

685
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:45,720
And it sure don't make him no saint
but for Sam that's a big deal.

686
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:48,760
He most certainly do
has a conscience, yes, sir.

687
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:53,400
And during all this time that
you've been observing him so closely

688
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:56,520
would you say he knows
what's going on around him?

689
00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:00,880
Would you say he's out of touch with reality?

690
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:05,000
Two nights back I was walking past
and he said, "Clyde."

691
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:08,640
He never called me that before
so I knew it was important.

692
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:10,880
Could I help? "With what, Sam?"

693
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:15,560
And he said, "I wanna die alone.
And I wanna die in decent clothes.

694
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:20,600
And I wanna eat an Eskimo Pie.
And could I see a sunrise?"

695
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:24,000
I said, "Last one's on me, Sam."

696
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:28,480
So I snuck him out, gave him an hour alone.

697
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:32,800
I watched from inside, I thought he might
lose it once the sun came.

698
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:38,000
See, it's been 15-16 years
since Sam last saw dawn break

699
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:40,080
but he held together just fine.

700
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:43,840
In your opinion,
based on your observations,

701
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:47,000
is Sam Cayhall in touch with reality?

702
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:48,480
Sam?

703
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:51,680
- You betcha.
- Thank you, Sergeant Packer.

704
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:53,320
Thank you.

705
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:56,240
Tender the witness, Your Honour.

706
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:02,920
- What's happening in the Fifth Circuit?
- Thumbs down on insanity.

707
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:04,960
Hi. There you are.

708
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:07,600
- What's Mr Hall been up to?
- No change.

709
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:09,880
Try again. What has he been working on?

710
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,680
- He's looking for new information.
- What kind of information?

711
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:16,920
- Nora?
- Sir?

712
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:21,520
You're not sleeping with him?

713
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:23,240
No!

714
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:25,520
Then what kind of information?

715
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:27,800
Anything, everything. He's desperate.

716
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:30,720
Where is he looking?

717
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:33,240
- I don't know.
- Find out.

718
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:36,400
Desperate people are dangerous.

719
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:40,160
Maybe you ought to be sleeping with him.

720
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:46,880
Hey.

721
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,480
- Can we talk?
- Sure.

722
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:54,240
Tammy?

723
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:04,760
The Sovereignty Commission
files the originals under lock and key

724
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,640
in the Hall of Records.

725
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:09,680
Why can't zoning reports wait for tomorrow?

726
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:12,120
You ask the governor. I like my job.

727
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:14,160
Nora...

728
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:18,040
Nora, Nora. It's you that I'm scared of.

729
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:21,440
Bing, please -
I've got to get this done tonight.

730
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:24,360
I'll lock up for you.

731
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:30,480
Our little secret.

732
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:33,800
You and me. Have a good evening!

733
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:58,600
This way.

734
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:51,080
Sovereignty Commissions.

735
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:15,280
White Citizens' Council, Indianola.

736
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:21,360
Go back.

737
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:35,920
- "MK situation should be followed."
- Marvin Kramer.

738
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:38,120
Or Martin King.

739
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:41,240
"Law Office, March 18th." Marvin Kramer.
When was the bombing?

740
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:44,360
April 28th.

741
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:50,160
"Action agreed September 2nd."
You said it was in April.

742
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:54,160
That's not a date, that's nine to two -
they took a vote.

743
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:56,440
- Oh, my God.
- "The Commission assigned SC."

744
01:00:56,560 --> 01:01:00,120
Sam Cayhall. What's RW?

745
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:03,120
You mean, who's RW?

746
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:20,080
Thanks.

747
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:28,560
Truth time, Sam. Five days.

748
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:33,240
We're firing everything
up to the Supreme Court but...

749
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:37,920
I need to know who RW is.

750
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:46,520
Sam, I saw the Commission's files,
you were with someone named RW.

751
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:48,960
You were assigned to bomb the office

752
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:52,440
by people who took no responsibility
for the death of those kids

753
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:56,520
and are gonna take
no responsibility for yours.

754
01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:01,080
I believe you call these people cowards?

755
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:05,720
Why you feel compelled to protect them
is beyond me.

756
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:10,440
First of all...

757
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:14,880
you snivelling little son of a bitch,
you speak to me like this again,

758
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:18,720
I'll rip your heart out
and shove it up your butt.

759
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:22,040
Second, if you spent half as much time
learning to be a lawyer

760
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:25,080
instead of playing Dick Tracy...

761
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:29,240
I might stand a chance
of not being dead in five days.

762
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:33,760
As it stands right now
everything you've tried has failed.

763
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:36,200
You've failed.

764
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:39,120
Now I have to pay the price.

765
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:44,240
You're a failure,
just like your pathetic father was!

766
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:47,040
That son of a bitch
didn't have the balls to live.

767
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:49,120
He was a loser and a quitter,

768
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:51,960
and he just gave his life away.

769
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:54,880
How dare he?

770
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:59,040
What right did he have to do that?
It wasn't his to give!

771
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:01,960
I gave it to him! His momma gave it to him!

772
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:04,280
It was God's! He had no right!

773
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:07,720
He just gave it away, goddamn it!
He gave it away!

774
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:10,600
Dammit, he gave it away!

775
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:13,240
- Why'd he do that?
- Come on.

776
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:16,240
He gave it away!

777
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:29,480
- Is she home?
- Miss Lee's resting,

778
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:32,720
she can't see you now...

779
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:35,640
Lee?

780
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:39,120
Where are you, Lee?

781
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:42,040
Lee?

782
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:45,520
Lee?

783
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:50,000
Lee?

784
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:59,520
Oh, Jesus.

785
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:14,200
My lucky little nephew.

786
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:23,080
Did I ever show you...

787
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:26,880
my favourite old family picture?

788
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:34,040
Come on. Come in.

789
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:41,920
I never kept an actual photo album.

790
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:46,680
Mostly because I never kept
any actual photos.

791
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:49,720
Here. Come here.

792
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:58,800
Here. Now, there.

793
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:05,040
See? He was a cute little thing. Wasn't he?

794
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:08,880
Problem is...

795
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:12,600
he was raised to be a monster.

796
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:20,120
Trained from birth.

797
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:30,040
We come from a long line of hate, Adam.

798
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:34,120
That's why I drink.

799
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:37,480
Make it all go away.

800
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:43,840
Now you're here
and it won't go away any more.

801
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:52,000
Go home!

802
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:08,720
I've got three things to say to you.

803
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:12,200
One, I'm your lawyer until you fire me.
I'm not quitting.

804
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:14,720
Two, when you killed Joe Lincoln

805
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:17,520
your seven-year-old daughter
was in the laurel tree.

806
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:20,720
She watched her daddy murder a man
in cold blood.

807
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:23,760
And three, Quince Lincoln
never stole a thing.

808
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:28,280
My father found that toy soldier
but he was too terrified to tell you.

809
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:31,680
He had to live with that
for the rest of his sad life.

810
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:36,800
Maybe you didn't have the balls
to put a stop to this but I do.

811
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:40,080
It ends with me. We've got four days left,

812
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:43,680
this is our last appeal
and it's called mitigating circumstances.

813
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:47,320
Talk to me.

814
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:50,840
Talk to me, Sam!

815
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:54,840
I'm tired of talking.

816
01:06:56,360 --> 01:07:01,520
I'm tired of waking up every morning
knowing I'm one day closer to dying.

817
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:05,360
Tired of living in a cage,
tired of these crappy cigarettes.

818
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:09,720
I'm just praying I'll die of cancer
before they gas me.

819
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:16,040
But mostly I'm just tired of waiting.

820
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:23,520
Just let me rest.

821
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:27,800
I'm really touched you can share
your feelings with me, Sam,

822
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:30,240
but at the moment I don't give a damn.

823
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:35,720
I'm too busy trying to win my case.
Now, start talking!

824
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:41,960
Here are some synonyms for mitigating -
glossing over,

825
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:43,600
sugar-coating,

826
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:45,360
prettifying.

827
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:48,560
There's nothing pretty
about twin boys being blown to bits,

828
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:50,920
no glossing over the suicide of their father,

829
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:53,720
and there's no sugar-coating this fact -

830
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:58,080
my client is guilty
and he deserves to be punished.

831
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:03,520
Mens rea. To do the thing.

832
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:05,760
Sam Cayhall did the thing

833
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:08,000
but he does not deserve to be murdered

834
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:11,080
because he was taught from birth
that he had to do the thing.

835
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:14,200
That is what this court must understand.

836
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:19,320
He never knew he had any other recourse
but hatred and bigotry and violence.

837
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:21,800
His uncles and brothers were Klansmen,

838
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:24,560
his father was a Klansman,
even his grandfather.

839
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:28,560
His great-grandfather was one
of the co-founders of that hateful group.

840
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:32,400
I recently saw a photograph of him
at a lynching.

841
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:35,360
He was ten and it was his third.

842
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:40,320
Of course, this is awful, it's evil...

843
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:44,720
but blood and death
were served with Sunday breakfast.

844
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:49,520
His father was murdered at a funeral.
My client saw it.

845
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:54,720
As the court is no doubt aware,
my client is also my grandfather.

846
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:59,400
I'd like now to tell you some warm
and wonderful stories about our family.

847
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:02,680
Except I don't know any.

848
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:08,120
In fact, I don't find my grandfather
even remotely wonderful.

849
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:13,040
But I know this - the very things
that make him so monstrous

850
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:16,680
are the reasons that mitigate
against this state murdering him.

851
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:19,200
He was raised by his family and by this state

852
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:21,640
to become the man that he became.

853
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:25,880
By the time he was old enough
to choose he didn't have a choice.

854
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:29,040
This is the tragedy of Sam Cayhall.

855
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:34,960
It's a tragedy that has destroyed
three lives already.

856
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:39,320
In the name of mercy...

857
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:43,480
let it not murder what little is left of his life.

858
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:04,000
Thank you for seeing me like this.

859
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:07,120
Why are you here?

860
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:12,120
I'm hoping you'll ask the governor
to show some mercy.

861
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:15,000
Tell him you don't want my client to die.

862
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:19,000
I don't want him to die.
I don't want him to...

863
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:21,560
but I feel he must.

864
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:24,240
See, that's not true, it isn't, it...

865
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:26,280
Your word would carry a lot of weight,

866
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:29,720
and no one knows more than you
that there's been enough suffering

867
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:33,560
and it could all end right here, right now.

868
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:39,920
I didn't take them to nursery school
that morning because I was sick,

869
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:43,880
so I waved goodbye
from my bedroom window

870
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:47,160
and watched them
leapfrog off to their death.

871
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:49,680
Bye, Mommy, I love you!

872
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:51,920
<i>You see, the whole thing was my fault.</i>

873
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:54,240
Be good!

874
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:59,280
- Adam?
- Ma'am?

875
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:02,800
Why are you really here?

876
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:16,120
One day I found my father on the floor
in my bedroom with a gun in his hand.

877
01:11:16,240 --> 01:11:21,320
And I remember wondering,
"What are all those towels doing there?"

878
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:27,800
And then I realised that
he had arranged the towels in a circle...

879
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:34,040
and very carefully laid down in the centre
so he wouldn't make a mess.

880
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:38,880
In his note he said that he loved me

881
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,440
and he was sorry and...

882
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:44,960
he hoped that one day I'd understand.

883
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:49,360
He told me to take care
of my mom and my sister.

884
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:53,000
And there was a plastic garbage bag
on the floor.

885
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:55,080
I was to put the towels in the bag,

886
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:57,640
clean up the mess and call the police.

887
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:00,040
"Don't touch the gun," he said.

888
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:03,400
"Hurry up before the girls get home."

889
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:08,280
He had picked a day when he knew
I'd be the first one home.

890
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:12,160
I was ten.

891
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:17,600
I would dearly love to help you, Adam.
Please know this.

892
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:23,600
Sam Cayhall destroyed both our families.
Mine just died first.

893
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:28,280
And I'm sorry but he has to die.

894
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:30,640
Why?

895
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:35,560
He has to die because I had champagne
at my birthday party.

896
01:12:35,680 --> 01:12:39,920
He has to die because
a story needs an ending.

897
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:46,560
He has to die because
I don't care if he had no choice...

898
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:52,800
he chose to bomb that building...
and my family died.

899
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:01,600
You know, they were your age then.

900
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:07,440
And they would have been your age now.

901
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:43,840
Haven't given up, have you?

902
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:50,720
Sometimes I just like to see
if I still have what it takes.

903
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:52,720
Jesus. What are you doing here?

904
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:57,000
I've been watching you, kid.
You deserve the facts.

905
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:03,200
Back in '67 I found an old drunk,
he was a dishwasher.

906
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:07,920
He claimed the night before the bombing
he saw Sam in a diner with another guy.

907
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:10,120
I need a name.

908
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:14,160
The description matched a guy
that we always suspected but...

909
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:16,320
RW.

910
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:20,960
Rollie Wedge.

911
01:14:23,320 --> 01:14:27,320
A real hater, but smart.
We could never tie him to anything.

912
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:28,840
Where is he now?

913
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:32,120
They've gathered - sort of like a reunion -

914
01:14:32,240 --> 01:14:35,600
the night before the big execution
and all that.

915
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:39,520
I figure if he's here, he's there.

916
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:14,160
...slapped the hell out of him,
he took a lickin', didn't he?

917
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:16,280
Looking forward to...

918
01:15:40,720 --> 01:15:43,600
Outside! Come on.

919
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:41,960
Get away from that boy.

920
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:44,880
Get.

921
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:48,720
Thank you. Oh, God.

922
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:54,120
Thank you. I appreciate it.

923
01:16:54,240 --> 01:16:57,400
You do?

924
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:05,240
Rollie Wedge.

925
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:08,800
One of the many names
that I've been called.

926
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:11,440
What do you think you're doing here?

927
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:14,320
You planted the bomb that killed those kids.

928
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:18,120
Were you planning a citizen's arrest?

929
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:20,160
I just want to hear you admit it.

930
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:22,360
Delusion, Mr Hall.

931
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:26,120
You're looking for a clean "yes"
so you can identify,

932
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:29,560
quantify, organise a concept of evil.

933
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:33,080
If I did it then I'm the evil

934
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:35,720
and I can be culled from the flock,

935
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:39,240
removed, separated, destroyed.

936
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:40,960
Evil can be destroyed

937
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:46,840
and all you good people can feel safe
in the cocoon of your denial.

938
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:49,960
- Sam says you're his people.
- We are one.

939
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:52,400
Is this how you treat your people?

940
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:55,760
Let 'em take a fall for you?

941
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:58,880
What about loyalty?

942
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:02,760
What about the truth?

943
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:11,560
The truth, based on your laws, Attorney Hall,

944
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:16,160
is that Sam Cayhall is guilty
and has been sentenced to death.

945
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:19,200
Perhaps it's time for you
to show some loyalty

946
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:22,000
and let justice be served.

947
01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:24,920
And after it is...

948
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:28,160
always look behind you.

949
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:31,840
Always.

950
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:49,160
- He's probably still there.
- And?

951
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:52,840
If Sam were tried as an accomplice,
the most he'd get is 20 years.

952
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:54,800
You said you wanted new information.

953
01:18:54,920 --> 01:19:00,440
With all due respect, this is hardly
compelling evidence of anything.

954
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:03,360
Grant a stay, give me more time.

955
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:06,640
All right, men, listen up.

956
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:11,400
0800 hours, I hereby activate
the Emergency Operations Centre.

957
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:13,640
This institution is on lockdown status.

958
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:17,920
<i>I expect each of you
to discharge your duty accordingly.</i>

959
01:19:18,040 --> 01:19:20,440
<i>No second-guessing, no improvising.</i>

960
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:24,320
This execution will take place in 16 hours.

961
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:25,960
What you did to those babies...

962
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:31,360
no one could ever forgive you for.

963
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:36,600
What you did to me...

964
01:20:37,880 --> 01:20:40,680
and Eddie...

965
01:20:43,160 --> 01:20:46,320
I've got to.

966
01:20:53,960 --> 01:20:56,760
Not for you, old man...

967
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:03,880
for me.

968
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:25,280
Eddie said...

969
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:31,400
you'd never have shot Joe Lincoln...

970
01:21:32,280 --> 01:21:35,520
if I'd have cried out for you not to.

971
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:40,200
Is that why you came here?

972
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:46,880
No.

973
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:57,840
Would you still have shot him?

974
01:22:00,520 --> 01:22:03,920
Yeah, yeah.

975
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:35,720
<i>The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals
denied Sam Cayhall's last appeal.</i>

976
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:38,760
<i>The US Supreme Court
will rule later today on his fate.</i>

977
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:43,280
<i>If they deny, Governor David McAllister
will be his last chance.</i>

978
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:46,320
<i>The execution is set
for 12:01 tomorrow morning.</i>

979
01:22:46,440 --> 01:22:50,000
<i>Stephanie Bell Flynt, WLBT News.</i>

980
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:59,600
Got a light, yeah?

981
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:18,480
Sam?

982
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:24,600
Met some of your real people last night.

983
01:23:25,640 --> 01:23:29,920
Real interesting group, your real people.

984
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:35,960
Especially Rollie Wedge.

985
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:39,840
Rollie Wedge.

986
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:43,760
He was real interesting.

987
01:24:01,080 --> 01:24:03,000
I have to talk to the guards.

988
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:05,920
Rack up Sam.

989
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:18,880
You look a lot like your brother.

990
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:55,880
I came to pay my respects, Sam.

991
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:58,880
Say goodbye.

992
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:03,240
Make sure you're still strong.

993
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:11,440
I saw those two little kids.

994
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:14,880
They was in the window.

995
01:25:16,120 --> 01:25:18,920
That was a mistake.

996
01:25:19,480 --> 01:25:23,800
We kept two little Jews
from growing up into big Jews.

997
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:26,440
When their nigger-loving father
killed hisself

998
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:31,400
it was like dropping
a little hook-nosed pebble in a pond.

999
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:36,800
The ripples went out with a message
for all the world to see -

1000
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:40,800
the Jew is weak.

1001
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:44,000
How do you figure that for a mistake?

1002
01:25:44,120 --> 01:25:46,400
Weren't supposed to be no killing.

1003
01:25:46,520 --> 01:25:48,920
Don't go soft, Sam.

1004
01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:52,000
The day is coming.

1005
01:25:54,160 --> 01:25:58,240
I wish you could stick around to see it,
buddy, it's coming.

1006
01:25:58,360 --> 01:26:01,040
Every day, more people open their eyes

1007
01:26:01,160 --> 01:26:03,800
and see the only thing wrong
with this country

1008
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:09,520
is we've gone against the laws of nature,
God's law.

1009
01:26:11,640 --> 01:26:15,880
Only the strong have a right to survive.

1010
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:19,520
And now, finally...

1011
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:21,520
those not worthy -

1012
01:26:21,640 --> 01:26:26,960
the Jew, the African,
he who lies with another man -

1013
01:26:27,080 --> 01:26:29,920
they're all digging their own graves

1014
01:26:30,040 --> 01:26:32,320
and when we pile them in there

1015
01:26:32,440 --> 01:26:34,880
I'll drink a toast to you, Sam,

1016
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,840
and I'll piss it out on their dead faces.

1017
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:39,520
No.

1018
01:26:39,640 --> 01:26:42,680
You've been a good and loyal soldier, Sam.

1019
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:45,640
Go with the dignity that is yours,

1020
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:51,680
don't be confused by that little boy
who's got his daddy's weak blood in him.

1021
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:54,720
He ain't pure, he ain't us.

1022
01:26:54,840 --> 01:27:00,160
No, you son of a bitch. You son of a bitch.

1023
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:03,680
I ain't you. I ain't you!

1024
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:06,280
You touch him, I kill you.

1025
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:11,360
I'll rip your head off.
I'll kill you, you son of a bitch.

1026
01:27:11,480 --> 01:27:13,240
- You know who this is?
- Your brother.

1027
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:16,760
No, he ain't my brother.
You ain't my brother!

1028
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:19,240
- Get out of here.
- I'll be praying for you.

1029
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:21,880
You go to hell, you son of a bitch.

1030
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,960
- Go to hell!
- I'll be praying for you.

1031
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:40,240
Rack Sam.

1032
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:47,680
No word from the courts.

1033
01:28:01,400 --> 01:28:06,800
I'd like you to mail this for me.
If you would.

1034
01:28:08,840 --> 01:28:12,040
I don't have the addresses.

1035
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:28,320
Don't give up, Sam.

1036
01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:34,360
There is one other thing.

1037
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:47,760
Take that.

1038
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:56,320
Rack Sam.

1039
01:29:02,640 --> 01:29:04,320
It's the Supreme Court.

1040
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:08,400
The coffee's French Market,
just like you asked.

1041
01:29:08,520 --> 01:29:11,320
Thank you.

1042
01:29:14,320 --> 01:29:17,440
Rack back.

1043
01:29:21,200 --> 01:29:24,000
Adam Hall.

1044
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:32,360
No. OK.

1045
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:45,000
It ain't over, Sam.

1046
01:29:45,120 --> 01:29:48,120
It ain't over.

1047
01:29:59,720 --> 01:30:01,720
<i>The United States Supreme Court</i>

1048
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:07,200
<i>has denied a flurry of last-minute appeals
on behalf of Sam Cayhall.</i>

1049
01:30:20,240 --> 01:30:24,560
Gas his ass! Gas his ass!

1050
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:30,520
Hurry. Let's go.

1051
01:30:30,640 --> 01:30:33,200
Go.

1052
01:30:33,960 --> 01:30:36,040
Cayhall signed the request.

1053
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:40,120
Goodman's in court now asking to open up
the Sovereignty Commission files.

1054
01:30:40,240 --> 01:30:41,880
What should we do?

1055
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:45,600
I don't recall being asked to do anything.
Let's see what's in there.

1056
01:30:45,720 --> 01:30:49,120
It suggests an accomplice
to the Kramer bombing, for one.

1057
01:30:49,240 --> 01:30:51,640
Some far-right crazy named Rollie Wedge.

1058
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:54,600
How the hell do you know that?

1059
01:30:59,080 --> 01:31:02,400
We'll discuss it later.
Now, if you'll excuse us?

1060
01:31:02,520 --> 01:31:06,440
- You were saying?
- I don't think it'll work.

1061
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:10,920
There are other names. Some familiar.

1062
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:15,600
Knowing in advance might be very useful.

1063
01:31:31,160 --> 01:31:33,960
It's the Governor, sir.

1064
01:31:34,160 --> 01:31:35,280
Hello, Governor.

1065
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:39,920
<i>Senator, Sam Cayhall's attorneys are trying
to get some Sovereignty files released</i>

1066
01:31:40,040 --> 01:31:42,720
<i>that you and your colleagues
might not appreciate.</i>

1067
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:46,120
<i>I got a proposition for y'all
but you have to act fast.</i>

1068
01:31:46,240 --> 01:31:48,880
Can't go home if you're going by the mill

1069
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,120
Cos the bridge washed out
at the bottom of the hill

1070
01:31:51,240 --> 01:31:53,760
Big Creek's up and the Little Creek's level

1071
01:31:53,880 --> 01:31:57,760
Plough my corn with a double shovel...

1072
01:31:59,320 --> 01:32:02,240
These are for you, Cayhall.

1073
01:32:08,920 --> 01:32:12,760
I can offer you a sedative if you'd like.

1074
01:32:14,600 --> 01:32:17,400
All right.

1075
01:32:18,240 --> 01:32:22,080
Then you'd best start changing.
I'll be back in 30 minutes.

1076
01:32:22,200 --> 01:32:25,600
Don't be late.

1077
01:32:33,080 --> 01:32:35,040
Pull off your coat, throw it in the corner

1078
01:32:35,160 --> 01:32:39,120
Don't see why you don't stay a little longer

1079
01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:43,240
Old mule and the grasshopper
eating ice cream...

1080
01:33:12,640 --> 01:33:16,240
Gas his ass, gas his ass!

1081
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:28,880
Rack up Cayhall.

1082
01:33:59,040 --> 01:34:01,840
It's all right.

1083
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:10,480
Appeal's on the 28th, now don't forget.

1084
01:34:10,600 --> 01:34:13,320
I left your papers with Barry
in the law library.

1085
01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:14,800
Thanks, Sam.

1086
01:34:14,920 --> 01:34:18,840
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,

01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:23,120
<i>the Honourable David Allen McAllister.</i>

1088
01:34:29,480 --> 01:34:31,640
Tonight...

1089
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:34,680
the Supreme Court of the United States

1090
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:40,760
rejected all appeals
filed on behalf of Sam Cayhall.

1091
01:34:43,120 --> 01:34:46,400
<i>So, at this moment of truth</i>

1092
01:34:46,520 --> 01:34:49,800
<i>I must face the terrible burden
of this office</i>

1093
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:53,680
<i>that is mine and mine alone.</i>

1094
01:34:53,880 --> 01:34:56,200
<i>The question for me tonight is,</i>

1095
01:34:56,320 --> 01:35:00,480
<i>who is David Allen McAllister</i>

1096
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:02,760
<i>to imagine in his finest hour...</i>

1097
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:05,400
- See you, JB.
- See you soon, Sam.

1098
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:10,120
<i>- ...wiser than the jury and the 47 judges...
- Spit in their eye, Sam.</i>

1099
01:35:10,240 --> 01:35:14,520
<i>...who have reviewed this case
over the last 16 years?</i>

1100
01:35:14,640 --> 01:35:18,560
<i>- Sam. Remember the Lord is with you.
- The answer's clear.</i>

1101
01:35:18,680 --> 01:35:20,840
<i>In the matter of life and death,</i>

1102
01:35:20,960 --> 01:35:26,400
<i>none among us are more knowing
than our system of justice.</i>

1103
01:35:27,200 --> 01:35:31,120
<i>Tonight, however,
information has come to us suggesting</i>

1104
01:35:31,240 --> 01:35:35,080
<i>Mr Cayhall may not have acted alone
in this heinous crime.</i>

1105
01:35:35,200 --> 01:35:39,520
<i>Now if these allegations prove to be true,</i>

1106
01:35:39,640 --> 01:35:43,480
<i>rest assured, anyone found to be involved</i>

1107
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:47,640
<i>will be prosecuted
to the fullest extent of the law.</i>

1108
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:49,800
However,

1109
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:54,320
no matter how many additional people
may be implicated in the future,

1110
01:35:54,440 --> 01:35:59,440
it does not change a fundamental fact -

1111
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:02,640
Sam Cayhall is guilty as charged

1112
01:36:02,760 --> 01:36:06,520
and Sam Cayhall must pay the price.

1113
01:36:13,240 --> 01:36:15,040
So it...

1114
01:36:15,160 --> 01:36:20,160
It is with the greatest humility

1115
01:36:20,280 --> 01:36:25,280
that I bow in deference
to that great lady, Justice.

1116
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,560
At one minute past midnight,

1117
01:36:28,680 --> 01:36:31,280
Sam Cayhall will meet his maker.

1118
01:36:31,400 --> 01:36:35,800
<i>The final judgment will truly be His.</i>

1119
01:36:40,200 --> 01:36:43,120
<i>To the family of the victims...</i>

1120
01:36:43,240 --> 01:36:48,840
<i>we say nothing can replace
your great and terrible loss.</i>

1121
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:53,400
<i>Revenge will never lessen
the unfillable void</i>

1122
01:36:53,520 --> 01:36:56,240
<i>left by those now gone.</i>

1123
01:36:56,360 --> 01:36:59,560
And we pray with you...

1124
01:37:00,240 --> 01:37:04,080
that God may grant us
the strength and the courage

1125
01:37:04,200 --> 01:37:10,240
to prevent crimes like this
from ever again darkening our soul

1126
01:37:10,360 --> 01:37:13,320
with the blood of the innocent.

1127
01:37:15,800 --> 01:37:20,280
Good night and God bless America.

1128
01:37:24,720 --> 01:37:26,800
Kid, don't.

1129
01:37:26,920 --> 01:37:29,320
Don't try to save me any more.

1130
01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:35,640
I know someplace inside you,
you're trying to stir up some miracle.

1131
01:37:43,400 --> 01:37:46,200
We can't forget who Sam Cayhall is

1132
01:37:46,320 --> 01:37:49,120
or the kind of thinking that he represents.

1133
01:37:49,240 --> 01:37:51,440
I'm sure you haven't.

1134
01:37:51,560 --> 01:37:54,120
- And the other names?
- Useful information.

1135
01:37:54,240 --> 01:37:57,160
It'll help us effect
some real change next session.

1136
01:37:57,280 --> 01:37:59,880
Isn't that why we're doing this job?

1137
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:04,000
All progress is a negotiation, Nora.

1138
01:39:02,360 --> 01:39:05,520
Of all the people and things
I hated my whole life,

1139
01:39:05,640 --> 01:39:09,360
the one I hated most was me.

1140
01:39:12,920 --> 01:39:16,680
I was given free entry into this world
to make of it whatever I could.

1141
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:20,280
I've been sitting here for 16 years.

1142
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:25,800
I was thinking, I...
I never did anybody any good.

1143
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,800
Till you came down.

1144
01:39:40,640 --> 01:39:45,000
See, if I'm gonna be proud of you,
I got to be proud of your daddy.

1145
01:39:45,120 --> 01:39:49,120
He wasn't a weak guy, he was strong.

1146
01:39:51,160 --> 01:39:54,920
Strong enough to get away...

1147
01:39:55,040 --> 01:39:59,440
strong enough to give you
whatever it is that you got.

1148
01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:04,520
If he was able to give that to you,

1149
01:40:04,640 --> 01:40:09,360
I reckon this old man must have passed on
something good to him.

1150
01:40:14,920 --> 01:40:17,720
And I didn't know that.

1151
01:40:33,960 --> 01:40:36,760
I'm ready.

1152
01:40:46,320 --> 01:40:49,920
You come on in, we been waiting for you.

1153
01:41:01,360 --> 01:41:04,560
Do you know where you're going?

1154
01:42:18,080 --> 01:42:20,880
Moving right along.

1155
01:43:46,520 --> 01:43:50,120
What the fuck is going on, man?

1156
01:44:45,880 --> 01:44:47,800
Sam, this is your death warrant.

1157
01:44:47,920 --> 01:44:50,520
You know I'm required by law
to read it to you.

1158
01:44:50,640 --> 01:44:54,000
"We, the jury, find unanimously
and beyond a reasonable doubt

1159
01:44:54,120 --> 01:44:56,480
the following aggravating circumstances.

1160
01:44:56,600 --> 01:45:00,200
The capital murder
was committed during a felony.

1161
01:45:00,320 --> 01:45:03,800
The capital murder was especially heinous,
atrocious and cruel.

1162
01:45:03,920 --> 01:45:07,640
We, the jury, find unanimously
and beyond a reasonable doubt

1163
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:11,560
the defendant Sam Cayhall
should be put to death by lethal gas

1164
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:14,840
at the Mississippi State Penitentiary.

1165
01:45:14,960 --> 01:45:18,440
The 13th day of April, 1996."

1166
01:45:18,920 --> 01:45:20,280
Come on!

1167
01:45:20,400 --> 01:45:22,200
And no stays.

1168
01:45:22,320 --> 01:45:25,280
Is there any reason why
this execution should not proceed?

1169
01:45:25,400 --> 01:45:28,200
No.

1170
01:45:28,560 --> 01:45:31,320
Any final words, Mr Cayhall?

1171
01:48:08,240 --> 01:48:11,160
Maybe the ghosts are gone, Lee.

1172
01:48:14,800 --> 01:48:17,600
Maybe.

1173
01:48:21,960 --> 01:48:24,840
Thank you, Adam.
