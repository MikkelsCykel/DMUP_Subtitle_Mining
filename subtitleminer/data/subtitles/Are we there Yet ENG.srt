00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:11,127
Mom says we have to be polite
to her dates...

2
00:01:11,296 --> 00:01:13,992
...and we will
if he makes it to the door.

3
00:01:52,003 --> 00:01:55,530
-Merry Christmas, sucker.
-And don`t come back for Kwanzaa.

4
00:01:56,007 --> 00:01:57,838
Think you`re going out
with our mama?

5
00:01:58,009 --> 00:01:59,840
l`m gonna get you two.

6
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:10,080
Get me out of here!

7
00:02:13,825 --> 00:02:16,020
Lindsey, you really think Dad`s
coming back?

8
00:02:16,194 --> 00:02:19,857
Any day now. But until then,
we have to keep Mom available.

9
00:02:20,131 --> 00:02:22,258
Problem is, she`s just too pretty.

10
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:24,697
That just makes our job
a whole lot tougher.

11
00:02:25,737 --> 00:02:28,035
Sometimes l feel sorry for her.

12
00:02:28,206 --> 00:02:32,336
Well, l feel sorry for the next sucker
who tries to put the moves on her.

13
00:02:45,089 --> 00:02:47,421
-Mr. Persons.
-My man.

14
00:02:47,592 --> 00:02:49,617
What you got for me?

15
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:06,604
-l`ll get the door for you.
-Got that new-car smell, you know?

16
00:03:07,512 --> 00:03:09,503
This puppy`s missing one thing.

17
00:03:13,051 --> 00:03:16,680
Welcome to the big leagues, Satch.
Let`s make it happen.

18
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:22,751
Look at this ride. Parchment leather
with the satin nickel trim.

19
00:03:23,895 --> 00:03:27,592
Look out, ladies,
here we come. Holla.

20
00:03:41,112 --> 00:03:43,910
Nick Persons. How`s it going, man?

21
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:46,781
How`s it look?

22
00:04:00,798 --> 00:04:04,757
Keep driving, fool. That`s the one
that sicced her dog on you.

23
00:04:22,453 --> 00:04:26,150
What? You want some of this, huh?
You want a piece of me?

24
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:48,345
Oh, my goodness.
Six thousand pounds of respect.

25
00:04:48,513 --> 00:04:51,414
-Yeah. lt`s nice, huh?
-Yeah.

26
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:52,913
-Take it for a spin?
-Yeah.

27
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:54,745
l don`t think so.

28
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,952
-Man, what did that unit set you back?
-l got a good deal on it.

29
00:05:00,124 --> 00:05:02,718
Right. Your payments probably
cost more than my car.

30
00:05:02,894 --> 00:05:05,658
Marty, my shoes cost more
than your car.

31
00:05:06,831 --> 00:05:09,197
Look, Nick, here come your
favorite customers.

32
00:05:09,367 --> 00:05:13,030
-Hey, mister, you got any Yu-Gi-Oh?
-What you think?

33
00:05:13,404 --> 00:05:14,996
You got any Dragon Ball GT?

34
00:05:15,206 --> 00:05:18,175
Look, you come in here every day
asking the same questions.

35
00:05:18,343 --> 00:05:23,042
We ain`t got no Pokemon, no Digimon,
no Buffy, no SpongeBob...

36
00:05:23,214 --> 00:05:25,682
...no Beanie Babies
and no shoplifters.

37
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:28,683
Now, get! Both of y`all, get!

38
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:36,791
You better get.
You better get out of here.

39
00:05:37,929 --> 00:05:40,625
-You got a way with kids.
-They`re like cockroaches...

40
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:42,459
...except you can`t squish them.

41
00:05:44,769 --> 00:05:47,761
-You gonna clean that?
-l don`t do windows.

42
00:05:48,206 --> 00:05:50,731
What? lt`ll dry.

43
00:05:54,512 --> 00:05:57,481
People wanna know
why l hate kids.

44
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:23,438
What`s the matter with you?

45
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:30,511
-l think l`m in love.
-Love? No....

46
00:06:30,915 --> 00:06:33,509
What do you mean, love?

47
00:06:33,885 --> 00:06:37,844
Oh, yeah, that`s the new girl from
the party-planning place. Yikes.

48
00:06:38,122 --> 00:06:40,852
-She`s so fine.
-Yeah.

49
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:43,255
-Man, l got to get with that.
-Whoa, whoa.

50
00:06:43,428 --> 00:06:44,690
She`s a divorcee, man.

51
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:47,194
That`s way too much baggage
for a guy like you.

52
00:06:47,999 --> 00:06:50,331
Don`t be so quick
to judge people, man.

53
00:06:50,501 --> 00:06:52,662
This isn`t the Nick the Quick
that l know.

54
00:06:52,937 --> 00:06:55,462
-Hey, l had broccoli yesterday.
-So?

55
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,768
Sometimes you got to try
something new, my friend.

56
00:06:58,943 --> 00:07:00,774
Look and learn.

57
00:07:18,796 --> 00:07:20,286
-Mom! Mom!
-Mom! Mom!

58
00:07:24,101 --> 00:07:26,296
-How was school?
-l got 1 00 on my test.

59
00:07:26,471 --> 00:07:28,735
-Big deal.
-Okay, all right.

60
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:31,374
Who wants to go shoe shopping?
Let`s go.

61
00:07:36,147 --> 00:07:38,707
-What happened?
-Oh, man, she`s a breeder.

62
00:07:38,883 --> 00:07:40,145
Two of them.

63
00:08:02,807 --> 00:08:04,069
Hey, wait!

64
00:08:04,242 --> 00:08:06,267
-Oh, no.
-Help!

65
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:08,412
Do you have any jumper cables?

66
00:08:08,679 --> 00:08:10,943
No. No!

67
00:08:14,085 --> 00:08:16,849
Hey, Nick, don`t do this.

68
00:08:17,021 --> 00:08:19,854
She`s got two kids
and a broken-down car.

69
00:08:20,024 --> 00:08:23,050
What`s next? You gonna
ask her mama to move in with us?

70
00:08:32,103 --> 00:08:37,131
Oh, l`m so happy to see you.
l`ve been standing out here forever.

71
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:41,702
You know what?

72
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:45,406
This might not be a good idea,
because we got rain, electricity.

73
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:48,347
Oh, but l sure do appreciate it.

74
00:08:51,856 --> 00:08:53,153
Okay.

75
00:08:55,192 --> 00:08:58,923
You know, you look so familiar.

76
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:01,063
Have we met before?

77
00:09:01,232 --> 00:09:04,326
Well, l`m Nick. l work right across
the street from you.

78
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:08,802
Oh, that`s right. You`re the guy
that owns that cute little toy store.

79
00:09:09,373 --> 00:09:12,171
Fine sports collectibles.

80
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:14,470
Fine sports collectibles.

81
00:09:18,382 --> 00:09:20,475
l`ll hook this up for you.

82
00:09:29,493 --> 00:09:32,087
l think my car hates me.

83
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:35,393
Oh, but, Nick, this is a nice ride.

84
00:09:35,566 --> 00:09:37,329
-Oh, you like this, huh?
-Yeah.

85
00:09:37,501 --> 00:09:40,163
You know, look.
lt even heats the undercarriage.

86
00:09:41,072 --> 00:09:43,199
l like it.

87
00:09:44,108 --> 00:09:46,076
``l like it.``

88
00:09:46,243 --> 00:09:49,212
Remember the score:
one player, two kids and--

89
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,372
Holy moly!

90
00:09:53,117 --> 00:09:54,744
Oh, that is so cool.

91
00:09:54,919 --> 00:09:56,887
That`s a Satchel Paige bobblehead.

92
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:59,147
That`s when he played
for the Monarchs.

93
00:09:59,323 --> 00:10:03,953
What? A woman that knows a little
something about Satchel?

94
00:10:04,128 --> 00:10:07,529
He was my daddy`s idol.
He pitched for five decades...

95
00:10:07,698 --> 00:10:11,725
...including three shutout innings
for the Royals at the age of 59.

96
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:15,065
Well, you know, my man Satch
used to have a saying:

97
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:18,231
``Age is a question of
mind over matter.

98
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:21,242
lf you don`t mind, it don`t matter.``

99
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:23,972
You know that?

100
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:29,886
This is Suzanne.

101
00:10:30,054 --> 00:10:32,045
Hubba-hubba. Now, that`s a woman.

102
00:10:32,356 --> 00:10:37,020
Plenty of smarts, easy on the eyes,
and can quote my stats.

103
00:10:37,194 --> 00:10:40,254
l don`t care if she got 1 00 kids.
l like her.

104
00:10:41,732 --> 00:10:44,929
All we gotta do
is lose the small fries.

105
00:10:45,169 --> 00:10:48,104
Now, l`m not saying
drop them in the shark tank. No.

106
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:51,366
But there`s nothing kids like more
than military school.

107
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,903
Out of sight, out of mind.

108
00:10:55,212 --> 00:10:57,009
Excuse me?

109
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,276
l don`t mind.

110
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:04,114
-lf you need a lift, l`ll give you a ride.
-Oh, okay.

111
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:08,691
Smooth, Nick. Here`s how l think
that we gonna make our move.

112
00:11:08,993 --> 00:11:11,757
Pretend like you gonna help her
with her seat belt...

113
00:11:11,929 --> 00:11:16,423
...then with your free hand, put your
arm around her shoulder and-- Hey!

114
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,468
Let me out! How am l gonna
wave you home if l can`t see the play?

115
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:23,402
l`m a hall-of-famer.
How about showing some respect?

116
00:11:24,709 --> 00:11:26,199
And that`s my story.

117
00:11:26,377 --> 00:11:28,311
What about you, Nick?
Are you local?

118
00:11:29,714 --> 00:11:32,239
-Black man from Oregon?
-Right.

119
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:34,577
No. l`m from St. Louis.

120
00:11:34,752 --> 00:11:38,813
l actually moved out here to play
Triple-A ball with the Beavers...

121
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:42,425
...but ended up hurting my shoulder,
and it kind of ended my career.

122
00:11:42,593 --> 00:11:44,458
Oh, you threw
your arm out pitching.

123
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:47,494
Well, not exactly.

124
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:51,123
l tore my rotator cuff lifting my
big-screen TV out of a U-Haul.

125
00:11:54,705 --> 00:11:56,764
-That`s really sad.
-l know.

126
00:11:56,941 --> 00:12:01,640
Good thing there`s athlete`s insurance,
in case you do something stupid.

127
00:12:04,415 --> 00:12:07,543
So, you know, l was wondering...

128
00:12:07,718 --> 00:12:11,415
...if maybe you`d consider--
lf you wasn`t busy--

129
00:12:12,323 --> 00:12:15,292
-What is going on out here?
-Mom, where have you been?

130
00:12:15,459 --> 00:12:19,589
Miss Mable burned our dinner,
fell asleep and just keeps farting.

131
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:24,327
Kevin and Lindsey,
this is Mr. Persons.

132
00:12:24,502 --> 00:12:26,595
He was nice enough
to give me a ride home.

133
00:12:26,771 --> 00:12:28,864
What`s he want, a reward?

134
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,172
You know what?

135
00:12:32,343 --> 00:12:34,607
l really better get out of here.

136
00:12:34,979 --> 00:12:36,947
Smart.

137
00:12:38,949 --> 00:12:42,612
Hey, Nick?
l don`t mean to be a pest...

138
00:12:42,787 --> 00:12:47,121
...but l was just wondering if you could
give me a ride to work tomorrow.

139
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:50,385
-Of course.
-Oh, great. Thank you.

140
00:12:50,694 --> 00:12:53,322
-See you tomorrow.
-Bye.

141
00:12:55,299 --> 00:12:56,994
Mom, do you know what time it is?

142
00:12:57,168 --> 00:12:59,636
Excuse me, l`m the mother.
Get in the house.

143
00:12:59,804 --> 00:13:01,465
-Get in the house.
-lt`s raining.

144
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:04,107
-Get in the house.
-Who is this stud, Nick?

145
00:13:04,275 --> 00:13:06,243
You`re supposed to be in bed.

146
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:13,102
Nick, thank you so much for
helping me these past couple days.

147
00:14:13,277 --> 00:14:17,646
-You are so sweet.
-Yeah, l know.

148
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:20,611
Hey, does this seem ripe to you?

149
00:14:22,086 --> 00:14:26,580
l don`t know. l don`t eat food unless
it has an expiration date on it.

150
00:14:26,757 --> 00:14:31,285
Nick, you are funny. You eat worse
than my 7-year-old son.

151
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:33,892
You kind of dress like him too.

152
00:14:34,064 --> 00:14:35,497
What`s wrong with that?

153
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:38,666
And do you know l have never
seen you without a hat?

154
00:14:38,969 --> 00:14:41,631
-You don`t need to see me without it.
-Let me see.

155
00:14:41,805 --> 00:14:43,238
-What`s under there?
-What?

156
00:14:43,407 --> 00:14:45,807
-Come on, Nick.
-Watch out. Get back. Hold on.

157
00:14:45,976 --> 00:14:48,945
-Get back.
-Give me that.

158
00:14:54,285 --> 00:14:57,686
Hang on. Don`t move.

159
00:14:58,389 --> 00:15:00,152
There.

160
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,856
-Nick, wait.
-Right.

161
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:12,696
-Wanna go to my apartment?
-No, l can`t. l can`t.

162
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:17,432
l`ve thought about it. l really have.
But let`s be realistic. l`m a single mom.

163
00:15:17,608 --> 00:15:20,668
No, you`re a sexy mama.

164
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:25,173
Do you know this whole time
we`ve been hanging out...

165
00:15:25,349 --> 00:15:27,681
...you`ve never once asked me
about my kids?

166
00:15:29,753 --> 00:15:33,280
-How they doing?
-l bet you don`t remember their names.

167
00:15:35,359 --> 00:15:37,919
Rudy and Theo?

168
00:15:38,095 --> 00:15:39,790
Nick.

169
00:15:43,467 --> 00:15:46,334
l think we should just be friends.

170
00:15:50,007 --> 00:15:51,475
Next point wins. Let`s go.

171
00:15:51,475 --> 00:15:52,407
Next point wins. Let`s go.

172
00:15:53,677 --> 00:15:55,975
Hold on to your earrings there,
Yao Bling...

173
00:15:56,146 --> 00:16:00,412
...because l`m gonna embarrass you.
And it`s gonna hurt because l love you.

174
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:02,848
-Give me that.
-Hey, that`s a foul.

175
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:05,352
-Come on, man, you hit my hand.
-No, l didn`t.

176
00:16:05,522 --> 00:16:07,820
Right here, baby. Right here.

177
00:16:07,992 --> 00:16:09,186
Game time.

178
00:16:10,127 --> 00:16:12,857
Yeah, baby. Yeah.
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

179
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:15,790
Get off of me, Lurch.
That was a moving pick.

180
00:16:15,966 --> 00:16:17,991
Let`s run it again. Same teams.
Come on.

181
00:16:18,235 --> 00:16:19,896
No. l gotta go, y`all.

182
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:22,197
What? We`re tied.
Somebody has to lose.

183
00:16:22,373 --> 00:16:25,536
-lt`s the American way.
-Hey, somebody did lose.

184
00:16:25,709 --> 00:16:28,701
-You know l gotta go do that thing.
-What thing? What?

185
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:32,337
You know, l gotta take Suzanne
to the airport in the morning.

186
00:16:32,883 --> 00:16:36,751
Take Suzanne to the airport
in the morning.

187
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,582
-You are stuck in the friend zone.
-Get out of here.

188
00:16:39,757 --> 00:16:42,590
Listen to me. We`ve been friends
a very long time...

189
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,354
...and l am telling you,
you gotta dump this girl.

190
00:16:45,529 --> 00:16:48,726
-What? We not even going out.
-That`s the point, Nick.

191
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:52,027
Whatever it is you don`t have
going on, it has got to end.

192
00:16:53,237 --> 00:16:56,172
Okay, for all those who listen
to this clown...

193
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:58,774
...Nick Persons will never be
in the friend zone.

194
00:16:58,942 --> 00:17:02,400
-Understand that and believe that.
-Friend zone. Friend zone.

195
00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:05,104
-Don`t say l didn`t warn you.
-Friend zone.

196
00:17:13,757 --> 00:17:16,089
-Here you go.
-Oh, Nick, thank you so much.

197
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:18,057
You are such a great friend.

198
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:21,487
The friend zone is for losers only.

199
00:17:21,765 --> 00:17:25,292
Please unload your friend
and get on with your life.

200
00:17:25,903 --> 00:17:28,303
-Well, wish me luck.
-Good luck.

201
00:17:30,374 --> 00:17:32,604
Thanks for everything, Nick.

202
00:17:33,811 --> 00:17:36,871
Suzanne, can l talk to you
real quick?

203
00:17:37,381 --> 00:17:38,643
Sure.

204
00:17:38,816 --> 00:17:42,650
You know, what we got going-- l mean,
we don`t really have something--

205
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,879
l don`t really know what to call this...

206
00:17:45,055 --> 00:17:46,989
-Hang on.
-...but it seems kind of....

207
00:17:47,157 --> 00:17:49,318
This is Suzanne.

208
00:17:51,161 --> 00:17:53,095
Yes, Frank.

209
00:17:53,263 --> 00:17:54,287
Just one sec.

210
00:17:57,067 --> 00:17:59,228
Well, when did that happen?

211
00:17:59,937 --> 00:18:02,929
Well, actually,
l`m already at the airport.

212
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:05,967
-Hey. You can`t park here.
-l know.

213
00:18:06,143 --> 00:18:09,044
My friend`s making a call.
She`ll be off in a second.

214
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:11,477
-Gonna be an expensive call.
-l`m right here.

215
00:18:11,782 --> 00:18:13,545
That`s why you`re getting a ticket.

216
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:16,982
They`re expecting to spend
New Year`s Eve with you.

217
00:18:17,154 --> 00:18:20,146
Oh, don`t-- Don`t even go there
with me, Frank.

218
00:18:20,324 --> 00:18:23,487
You haven`t spent five minutes
with your kids since Labor Day.

219
00:18:24,528 --> 00:18:29,056
Frank, you know what?
l am so sick of this.

220
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:34,400
l-- Hello? Hello?

221
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:37,703
Know what?
That lady`s got enough problems.

222
00:18:41,478 --> 00:18:43,673
All right, let`s move it along.

223
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:51,451
-l`m not going.
-What`s the matter?

224
00:18:51,622 --> 00:18:55,080
My ex is sick, and he`s not
gonna pick up the kids.

225
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:00,897
-What about the babysitter?
-She`s leaving for Las Vegas...

226
00:19:01,064 --> 00:19:04,591
-...with her church group.
-Oh, no.

227
00:19:05,836 --> 00:19:07,701
You know,
my kids miss him so much...

228
00:19:07,871 --> 00:19:11,807
...and all he ever does is pull the rug
out right from under them.

229
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:16,075
l`m gonna lose my job.

230
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,786
What if l bring them?

231
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:33,486
l couldn`t ask you to do that.
That`s too much.

232
00:19:33,664 --> 00:19:36,565
Why not?
Look, it`s no big deal. Serious.

233
00:19:39,269 --> 00:19:41,362
-Really?
-Positive.

234
00:19:42,206 --> 00:19:44,936
-Are you sure?
-l wanna help you on this.

235
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:48,940
Nick, this is huge.

236
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,941
Thank you so much.

237
00:19:52,716 --> 00:19:55,014
You are a lifesaver.

238
00:19:55,185 --> 00:19:59,246
Okay, so l`ll get the three tickets, and
as soon as you guys land, call me.

239
00:20:00,224 --> 00:20:03,557
Oh, no, l meant that l`ll drop them off
at the airport.

240
00:20:03,727 --> 00:20:06,821
Oh, no. You can`t expect the kids
to travel alone, Nick.

241
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:10,489
Kevin`s got asthma. That recycled air
in the plane-- l mean, yuck.

242
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:12,760
But it`d be fine. Kids fly all the time.

243
00:20:12,936 --> 00:20:15,427
lt`s nothing.
l`ll make sure they get on the plane.

244
00:20:15,606 --> 00:20:19,565
They`ll get milk and cookies, little
plastic wings, get to meet the pilot.

245
00:20:19,743 --> 00:20:22,576
You know, it`d be real cool.

246
00:20:24,047 --> 00:20:27,915
Especially with me sitting next to them
making sure everything is all right.

247
00:20:28,552 --> 00:20:32,147
Oh, how could l ever repay you?

248
00:20:45,269 --> 00:20:47,601
Obviously, you don`t care
that she`s using you.

249
00:20:47,771 --> 00:20:49,329
But ask yourself this:

250
00:20:49,506 --> 00:20:52,304
Would you trust a woman
who`d trust you with her kids?

251
00:20:52,476 --> 00:20:54,876
l`m tempted to call Child Services
right now.

252
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:57,611
Uncle Nick loves kids.

253
00:20:58,115 --> 00:21:01,983
Big lummox.
Might as well just put myself on eBay.

254
00:21:03,687 --> 00:21:07,282
Hello. l`m here to pick up the kids.

255
00:21:09,126 --> 00:21:11,526
Now, that`s what l`m talking about.

256
00:21:11,695 --> 00:21:14,858
What you wasting your time
with Miss Suzanne for?

257
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:17,494
-Excuse me?
-You come with me.

258
00:21:18,302 --> 00:21:21,897
Miss Mable will take you
on a guided tour to Sin City.

259
00:21:22,806 --> 00:21:25,138
Oh, God. Excuse me.

260
00:21:26,209 --> 00:21:29,474
Hello? Somebody?

261
00:21:30,314 --> 00:21:32,305
Who wants to go to Vancouver?

262
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:51,396
Mom says that we should be polite.

263
00:21:51,835 --> 00:21:55,703
Now, kids, l know you`re disappointed
about your father...

264
00:21:56,073 --> 00:21:59,304
...but you`re going to have fun.

265
00:22:00,177 --> 00:22:01,610
Aren`t you?

266
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:04,042
-Yes, Miss Mable.
-Yes, Miss Mable.

267
00:22:06,817 --> 00:22:09,012
Hey, did you bring us a gift?

268
00:22:09,186 --> 00:22:12,849
Yeah, Mom`s man friends
always bring us presents.

269
00:22:13,023 --> 00:22:15,548
Oh, of course.

270
00:22:15,726 --> 00:22:19,958
What kind of guy you think l am?
Uncle Nick loves kids.

271
00:22:20,497 --> 00:22:24,297
As a matter of fact....
Look, look, look.

272
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:26,766
Dr. Munchies pizza coupon.

273
00:22:26,937 --> 00:22:30,703
You get a free liter of soda with any
purchase of a large pepperoni.

274
00:22:30,874 --> 00:22:34,173
-What`s a liter?
-Oh, yeah, and for you....

275
00:22:37,381 --> 00:22:40,782
-Look at that. Corkscrew.
-Cool.

276
00:22:41,084 --> 00:22:44,247
-Hey, it`s got a knife.
-You can`t give him that.

277
00:22:44,554 --> 00:22:46,249
-Shut up.
-Make me.

278
00:22:46,423 --> 00:22:48,414
l don`t make trash. l bury it.

279
00:22:48,592 --> 00:22:52,892
-Well, l`ll bury my foot in your--
-Say it. You`re too scared to say it.

280
00:22:53,063 --> 00:22:54,792
Be quiet, you paranoid dunce.

281
00:22:54,965 --> 00:22:56,330
-Chicken.
-Stop it. Stop it.

282
00:23:00,303 --> 00:23:02,168
Hey, wanna learn some Chinese?

283
00:23:03,573 --> 00:23:05,268
Sure. What you got?

284
00:23:08,912 --> 00:23:12,439
Sensei says,
``The first one is always a decoy.``

285
00:23:13,984 --> 00:23:16,043
Shotgun!

286
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:21,218
That`s my seat. You stop.

287
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:29,995
They gonna eat you alive.

288
00:23:32,068 --> 00:23:35,037
-You`re too ugly to sit in the front seat.
-That`s my seat.

289
00:23:35,272 --> 00:23:37,365
Hey! Watch the paint.

290
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:47,778
Okay, now, once we get
in this terminal...

291
00:23:47,951 --> 00:23:49,942
...l want everybody
sticking together.

292
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,849
Now, be careful opening that door.

293
00:23:54,424 --> 00:23:56,449
Man! What did--?

294
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:04,697
-Sorry, Nick.
-Oh, damn!

295
00:24:04,868 --> 00:24:07,962
-Boy, didn`t you hear what l just said?
-You swore.

296
00:24:08,138 --> 00:24:11,801
You damn right l swore. That`s about
$400 worth of damage to my new car.

297
00:24:11,975 --> 00:24:15,103
That`s twice. Now you have to put
$2 in the swear jar.

298
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:17,803
Yeah, well, he gotta put about $400
in my pocket.

299
00:24:17,981 --> 00:24:19,812
-You got $400 for me?
-No.

300
00:24:19,983 --> 00:24:21,177
And l want it cash.

301
00:24:26,389 --> 00:24:28,857
Okay, man, no tears, all right?

302
00:24:29,025 --> 00:24:30,583
l won`t change diapers
out here.

303
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:34,924
Real good. Have you ever thought
of being a youth pastor or a therapist?

304
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:38,192
Look, it ain`t like l said l was gonna
take off my belt.

305
00:24:38,368 --> 00:24:40,598
He`s gonna beat me, Lindsey!
Save me!

306
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:42,704
-Hey. Hey, man.
-Don`t touch me!

307
00:24:42,873 --> 00:24:45,171
-Little dude. Kevin. Come here.
-Get away!

308
00:24:45,342 --> 00:24:46,809
ls there a problem here, sir?

309
00:24:46,977 --> 00:24:49,241
Just a little game l`m playing
with the kids.

310
00:24:49,412 --> 00:24:51,676
Boy, bring your butt back here!

311
00:24:51,848 --> 00:24:54,282
Kevin. Boy. Look.

312
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:56,749
Yo, yo, yo. Hey, hey.
Look, look.

313
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,547
Look, l got money. Check it out.

314
00:24:58,722 --> 00:25:00,485
Will that shut you up, huh?

315
00:25:00,657 --> 00:25:02,921
Here you go. Ten bucks. Come on.

316
00:25:03,894 --> 00:25:05,589
Yeah. That`s right.

317
00:25:05,762 --> 00:25:08,492
Hey, you can`t buy us off.
Apologize.

318
00:25:08,665 --> 00:25:10,530
No, no. We`re cool.

319
00:25:10,934 --> 00:25:13,164
Yeah. We cool, little mama.

320
00:25:13,336 --> 00:25:17,102
Plus, there`s enough to go around.
Got a ten-spot for you too.

321
00:25:18,408 --> 00:25:21,400
l do believe l`m older than him.

322
00:25:25,715 --> 00:25:30,084
l can`t believe l`m getting hustled
by a couple of gangsters. Here.

323
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,211
Now, hurry up. We can`t be late.

324
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:37,755
When we go through, they can see
our bones and innards?

325
00:25:38,028 --> 00:25:40,997
-No, fool, that`s an x-ray.
-Wrong answer.

326
00:25:41,164 --> 00:25:42,426
lt`s a metal detector.

327
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:44,294
Oh, to see if you have
any bombs?

328
00:25:44,901 --> 00:25:46,892
You`re not allowed to say
``bombs`` here.

329
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:50,836
-Why can`t you say ``bomb``?
-Please remove all metal objects.

330
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:53,271
Keys, loose change,
cell phones, jewelry.

331
00:25:53,443 --> 00:25:55,673
Okay. Just might take a minute.

332
00:26:00,216 --> 00:26:05,483
l hope you left Nick`s little present
in the car, or else you`re going to jail.

333
00:26:21,104 --> 00:26:23,095
Cell phone.

334
00:26:24,908 --> 00:26:26,239
Car keys.

335
00:26:32,983 --> 00:26:33,972
Excuse me. Sir?

336
00:26:42,092 --> 00:26:43,389
What? What?

337
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,687
Sir, can you step
to the red line, please?

338
00:26:45,862 --> 00:26:48,194
l put everything on the tray.

339
00:26:49,466 --> 00:26:52,663
Please raise your arms
and separate your legs.

340
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:06,977
Corkscrew!

341
00:27:14,324 --> 00:27:17,555
Let`s just get out of here before
l end up in Guantanamo Bay.

342
00:27:17,727 --> 00:27:19,752
Our dad would`ve never
given him a knife.

343
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:22,693
-Yeah, l`m not your dad.
-That`s for sure.

344
00:27:26,469 --> 00:27:28,494
All right, let`s go. Pick it up.

345
00:27:28,672 --> 00:27:31,937
lt`s actually gonna work out better
because trains are more fun.

346
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:34,906
-Do you got any snacks?
-You mean candy?

347
00:27:35,078 --> 00:27:36,875
-No way.
-l have to pee.

348
00:27:37,881 --> 00:27:41,749
Can`t you wait till we get on the train?
lt`s right there.

349
00:27:41,918 --> 00:27:45,615
-l don`t think l can wait that long.
-Yes, you can. Come on.

350
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:48,519
He`s prone to bladder infections,
you know.

351
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:53,228
All right, man, go do your business.

352
00:27:54,998 --> 00:27:56,693
Aren`t you coming in with me?

353
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:01,498
Yeah, but l`m not touching nothing.

354
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:05,873
All aboard!

355
00:28:06,042 --> 00:28:08,943
-Come on, come on.
-l`m coming.

356
00:28:11,081 --> 00:28:13,242
Wait. My shoe`s untied.

357
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:15,911
Come on.

358
00:28:17,287 --> 00:28:19,016
All clear.

359
00:28:21,925 --> 00:28:23,256
Come on, Kevin. Hurry up.

360
00:28:25,428 --> 00:28:27,328
Over....

361
00:28:29,299 --> 00:28:32,393
Loop. Other loop.

362
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:37,133
You know what? Let me do it.
Let me do it. Let me do it.

363
00:28:39,476 --> 00:28:41,444
No! Pull from the first loop.

364
00:28:41,611 --> 00:28:45,138
-Otherwise it`s too tight at the top.
-Okay, okay.

365
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:48,943
The boy has problems. He won`t eat
anything orange, steamed or poached.

366
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:51,815
And what he does eat,
they can`t touch.

367
00:28:52,055 --> 00:28:54,683
-Okay, there you go.
-No. Do it again.

368
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:56,553
That doesn`t feel right.

369
00:28:56,726 --> 00:28:58,557
His socks can`t have elastic
in them.

370
00:28:58,728 --> 00:29:01,322
And he won`t use a toothbrush
more than five days.

371
00:29:01,498 --> 00:29:03,295
-Shut up!
-Make me.

372
00:29:03,466 --> 00:29:05,195
Who`d wanna make another one--?

373
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:06,767
Come on.

374
00:29:07,604 --> 00:29:10,232
Hold on, hold on.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

375
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:30,157
Hey. Where`s Galaktico`s cape?

376
00:29:35,365 --> 00:29:37,026
Kevin.

377
00:29:38,701 --> 00:29:41,169
Final boarding call
for Vancouver passengers...

378
00:29:41,337 --> 00:29:43,805
...departing from track two.

379
00:29:48,444 --> 00:29:50,810
Look, it`s damp.

380
00:29:57,554 --> 00:30:00,819
Kevin! Lindsey!

381
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:09,360
Hey! Hey! Kevin! Lindsey!

382
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:18,335
Hey. The train`s moving.

383
00:30:22,245 --> 00:30:23,872
Out my way.

384
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,612
Hey! Crazy kids. Yo!

385
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:29,911
Hey! Hey, come on!

386
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:31,643
What are you doing?

387
00:30:31,821 --> 00:30:33,118
Sorry, lady.

388
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:35,450
-Hey!
-What`s he doing?

389
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:39,425
l think he wants us to jump
onto a moving train.

390
00:30:45,735 --> 00:30:50,104
Hey! Kevin! Lindsey!
Hey! Get up here!

391
00:30:50,373 --> 00:30:51,772
Come on!

392
00:30:51,941 --> 00:30:54,535
Hey, what are you doing? Run!

393
00:30:54,711 --> 00:30:56,838
Are you crazy? Jump!

394
00:30:57,013 --> 00:30:59,106
Come on!

395
00:31:07,757 --> 00:31:09,748
Mama.

396
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:17,156
-Hey, Nick, how`s the train ride going?
-Well, we haven`t exactly left yet.

397
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:20,234
We decided to drive.
lt should be much more educational.

398
00:31:20,403 --> 00:31:23,930
Oh, no, Nick, l cannot let you do that.
That`s way too much trouble.

399
00:31:24,107 --> 00:31:26,234
No, no. lt`ll only take
a few more hours...

400
00:31:26,409 --> 00:31:29,378
...and gives me a chance to get
to know Kevin and Lindsey.

401
00:31:29,545 --> 00:31:31,536
Okay. I`m really impressed.

402
00:31:31,981 --> 00:31:34,449
-You`re very sweet.
-Yes, l am.

403
00:31:34,784 --> 00:31:39,221
You sound like you have everything
under control. Can l talk to the kids?

404
00:31:39,389 --> 00:31:40,913
Oh, okay.

405
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:44,526
Look, don`t tell them nothing
that happened, okay?

406
00:31:45,728 --> 00:31:47,753
-He lost our luggage.
-What?

407
00:31:47,931 --> 00:31:49,262
-Are you guys dating?
-No.

408
00:31:49,432 --> 00:31:50,990
-No.
-Let me talk.

409
00:31:51,167 --> 00:31:52,691
We wanna go to Dad`s.

410
00:31:53,603 --> 00:31:56,299
You cannot go to Dad`s now.
You`re going with Nick.

411
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:59,038
Why? Dad`s house is
in the same direction.

412
00:31:59,509 --> 00:32:02,444
Nick could drop us off there
on his way not to date you.

413
00:32:02,612 --> 00:32:04,773
Honey, your dad is sick
and in bed.

414
00:32:04,948 --> 00:32:06,279
Now, if you want me to...

415
00:32:06,449 --> 00:32:09,646
...l can just quit my job, and we`ll
go live in a cardboard box.

416
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:12,680
Whatever.

417
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:15,990
-Let him drive.
-Be nice.

418
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:17,854
-l love you.
-Love you too.

419
00:32:18,027 --> 00:32:19,688
Bye.

420
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:25,394
Now, look, driving you two gremlins
on New Year`s Eve...

421
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:29,800
...for over 300 miles was never
on the agenda. Okay?

422
00:32:29,973 --> 00:32:33,465
We just drove across town,
and y`all done messed up my door.

423
00:32:33,643 --> 00:32:36,407
So now l got to lay down
some rules.

424
00:32:36,679 --> 00:32:37,703
Rule number--

425
00:32:41,217 --> 00:32:43,947
Rule number one:
Don`t touch the climate control.

426
00:32:44,487 --> 00:32:46,512
Rule number two:
Don`t kick the seat.

427
00:32:46,689 --> 00:32:49,487
Rule number three:
Don`t play with toys.

428
00:32:49,792 --> 00:32:52,955
-Can l play with my pizza coupon?
-No sassing me.

429
00:32:53,129 --> 00:32:56,360
No eating in the car, no drinking
in the car and no smoking.

430
00:32:56,532 --> 00:32:58,227
-l don`t smoke.
-Good.

431
00:32:58,401 --> 00:32:59,925
Don`t start on my watch.

432
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:01,968
l don`t want you to touch the radio.

433
00:33:02,138 --> 00:33:05,039
l don`t even want you to sniff
the new-car smell.

434
00:33:05,208 --> 00:33:08,006
l want you to sit down
on that protective plastic...

435
00:33:08,177 --> 00:33:10,611
...and be seen, not heard.

436
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:37,034
You know, if you`re thinking about
my mom, you`re wasting your time.

437
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:41,608
l`m not wasting my time, because
me and your mom, we`re just friends.

438
00:33:41,778 --> 00:33:45,612
That`s good, because Mom`s still
into Dad, and he`s totally into her.

439
00:33:45,782 --> 00:33:47,374
They`re getting back together.

440
00:33:48,051 --> 00:33:50,417
Whoopee! l`m happy for them.

441
00:33:50,586 --> 00:33:52,178
Or maybe you guys should go out.

442
00:33:52,355 --> 00:33:55,552
A couple of dates with you would
really make her appreciate Dad.

443
00:33:58,327 --> 00:34:00,227
Let`s go.

444
00:34:05,068 --> 00:34:07,502
Have a taste of my steel, zombie.

445
00:34:08,037 --> 00:34:10,801
-Yes!
-That game doesn`t sound G-rated.

446
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,008
Yeah, but it`s
keeping him occupied.

447
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:17,340
The boy played Lady Pac-Man at the
mall and had nightmares for a week.

448
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:19,413
-Give it here, Kevin.
-Hey, give it!

449
00:34:19,582 --> 00:34:21,982
-Give it to me. What did l say?
-lt`s not yours!

450
00:34:22,151 --> 00:34:25,120
-Give it here now!
-You`re not the boss of me!

451
00:34:25,288 --> 00:34:26,687
Cut it out.

452
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:29,620
Why don`t we call Mom
and see what she has to say.

453
00:34:30,293 --> 00:34:31,760
Fine.

454
00:34:31,928 --> 00:34:33,657
You win.

455
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:37,260
Snitch.

456
00:34:39,669 --> 00:34:41,193
Baby.

457
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:44,100
-Big baby.
-Bigger baby.

458
00:34:44,474 --> 00:34:47,136
-Giant baby.
-Enormous baby.

459
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:49,938
-Humongous baby.
-Colossal baby.

460
00:34:50,113 --> 00:34:52,104
-Am not. Am not.
-Are too. Are too.

461
00:34:52,281 --> 00:34:53,748
-Am not. Am not.
-Are too.

462
00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:55,315
Okay, okay.

463
00:34:55,485 --> 00:34:58,283
You`re both acting
like a couple of babies.

464
00:35:15,004 --> 00:35:16,733
Keep it moving. Come on.

465
00:35:18,608 --> 00:35:21,668
That`s right.
Drink your juice, baby.

466
00:35:22,612 --> 00:35:26,309
-Hey, no food in the car.
-lt`s not food. lt`s juice.

467
00:35:26,482 --> 00:35:28,074
-Same difference. Give it.
-Mine.

468
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:29,775
Hey!

469
00:35:29,952 --> 00:35:31,385
Man, see?

470
00:35:31,554 --> 00:35:33,784
Oh, y`all think that`s funny,
don`t you?

471
00:35:33,956 --> 00:35:35,651
lt`s not funny.

472
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:44,699
Whoa, whoa, whoa. No.

473
00:35:44,967 --> 00:35:47,492
One thing you gotta know here,
we keep it real.

474
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:49,399
You can believe that.

475
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:55,638
Yuck! Noisy.

476
00:35:55,811 --> 00:35:58,041
-What is that?
-50 Cent.

477
00:35:58,214 --> 00:36:00,705
Well, l`ll pay him a dollar
just to shut up.

478
00:36:02,685 --> 00:36:05,119
Do you have any Justin Timberlake
or Clay Aiken?

479
00:36:06,589 --> 00:36:09,285
Lord, these kids
are ethnically challenged.

480
00:36:09,825 --> 00:36:11,383
Do you know you can get shot...

481
00:36:11,561 --> 00:36:13,893
...by playing those CDs
in my old neighborhood?

482
00:36:14,063 --> 00:36:17,499
-We`re not ghetto.
-Or trying to be ghetto fabulous.

483
00:36:17,667 --> 00:36:19,862
We`re just fabulous.

484
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:41,415
About time. Open road.

485
00:36:41,591 --> 00:36:43,422
Vancouver, here we come.

486
00:36:55,404 --> 00:36:56,598
Yeah.

487
00:37:11,387 --> 00:37:12,615
l have to pee.

488
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:15,718
What? No, no,
you do not have to pee.

489
00:37:15,891 --> 00:37:17,756
Didn`t you go at the train station?

490
00:37:17,927 --> 00:37:20,794
l tried to go, but there was a man
standing next to me...

491
00:37:20,963 --> 00:37:22,260
...so it just went away.

492
00:37:22,431 --> 00:37:24,797
But look, man, all this open road.

493
00:37:24,967 --> 00:37:27,629
You can hold it. l know you can.
Cross your legs.

494
00:37:29,071 --> 00:37:32,165
-You should`ve asked before we left.
-l did.

495
00:37:32,341 --> 00:37:36,141
No, you asked before we got on the
train, not before we left the station.

496
00:37:36,412 --> 00:37:38,607
You`re supposed to ask
before every segment.

497
00:37:38,848 --> 00:37:41,646
-Everyone knows that.
-Evidently not.

498
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:44,713
l`m not gonna make it.
Do you have a bottle?

499
00:37:44,987 --> 00:37:47,114
-No.
-How about this ashtray?

500
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:49,588
Kevin, there`s no receptacle
in this vehicle.

501
00:37:49,759 --> 00:37:52,956
Now, look, the exit is about
a mile away, and you can hold it.

502
00:37:53,596 --> 00:37:55,791
How far is a mile?

503
00:37:55,965 --> 00:37:59,196
l don`t know, 5000
and some kind of feet.

504
00:37:59,368 --> 00:38:02,860
Look, think of something else.
Football, a math test...

505
00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:05,064
...puberty.

506
00:38:06,008 --> 00:38:07,908
-Are we there yet?
-No.

507
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:10,011
l`m sure the carpet is absorbent.

508
00:38:10,179 --> 00:38:11,669
Oh, here it comes!

509
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:15,517
For God`s sakes, man,
he`s gonna make his water in your car!

510
00:38:15,685 --> 00:38:17,016
No, he ain`t.

511
00:38:20,823 --> 00:38:25,021
lncoming! lncoming! lncoming!

512
00:38:26,195 --> 00:38:28,163
Hold it, man.

513
00:38:28,531 --> 00:38:32,194
-Hold it. Oh, no. Look, right here.
-Yeah.

514
00:38:35,137 --> 00:38:36,399
Here we go. Here we go.

515
00:38:42,078 --> 00:38:44,911
ln here, in here.
Hold it, hold it.

516
00:38:45,081 --> 00:38:46,639
-This is taken!
-l`m sorry!

517
00:38:46,816 --> 00:38:49,876
-Oh, it`s dribbling out.
-Okay, go, go. Just go.

518
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:58,218
-That`s disgusting!
-Hey, wait a minute.

519
00:38:58,394 --> 00:39:00,055
Wait a minute, lady. Hold up.

520
00:39:19,081 --> 00:39:20,912
Bought us some groceries for later.

521
00:39:21,083 --> 00:39:22,744
Your mama said you liked fruit.

522
00:39:24,387 --> 00:39:26,719
-Garlic olives?
-Hey, it`s a truck stop.

523
00:39:26,889 --> 00:39:28,288
That`s all they had.

524
00:39:32,561 --> 00:39:33,960
You see this?

525
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:37,430
Because of you guys,
l gotta do this right here.

526
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:40,467
You squeezed it, not me.

527
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:42,328
lt`s not coming out.

528
00:39:45,875 --> 00:39:47,866
Hit that green button for me, please.

529
00:39:50,746 --> 00:39:54,113
-Yo, yo, yo.
-Hey. Hey, it`s Marty. What`s up, man?

530
00:39:54,283 --> 00:39:57,150
How`s it going with those
stupid brats you got with you?

531
00:39:57,319 --> 00:40:01,688
Remember this: If the kids hate you,
the mama won`t date you.

532
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:04,052
-Man!
-Where`d you go?

533
00:40:04,226 --> 00:40:05,693
What, are you in a tunnel?

534
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:07,453
Are you--? Hello?

535
00:40:15,271 --> 00:40:16,533
Okay. All right.

536
00:40:18,874 --> 00:40:20,671
Seat belts.

537
00:40:21,777 --> 00:40:24,177
Nobody gotta go
to the bathroom, right?

538
00:40:27,416 --> 00:40:28,974
Okay, here we go.

539
00:40:33,756 --> 00:40:35,986
Nick, we already know
about you and Mom.

540
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,489
-You do?
-Of course.

541
00:40:39,662 --> 00:40:42,722
-She talks about you all the time.
-Yeah, Mom`s into you.

542
00:40:42,898 --> 00:40:45,458
She says you`re better looking
than Taye Diggs.

543
00:40:45,634 --> 00:40:46,965
Oh, yeah?

544
00:40:47,136 --> 00:40:49,400
-l am, huh?
-Oh, sure.

545
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:51,972
ln fact, she told me--

546
00:40:52,975 --> 00:40:55,808
My gosh. Get his inhaler.
He`s having an asthma attack.

547
00:40:55,978 --> 00:40:58,503
-What? Where is it?
-lt`s in the back. Hurry up!

548
00:40:58,781 --> 00:41:00,305
-Go! Go!
-All right, l`m going.

549
00:41:00,483 --> 00:41:02,007
-l got it. l got it.
-Move it!

550
00:41:04,286 --> 00:41:05,947
Good one, Lindsey.

551
00:41:06,655 --> 00:41:08,122
Very funny.

552
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:10,087
-Open up.
-l knew you were lying.

553
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:13,626
``We`re just friends.`` You`re just
using us to suck up to our mama.

554
00:41:13,796 --> 00:41:15,024
-What?
-Yeah.

555
00:41:15,197 --> 00:41:19,361
You`re just a dirty, horny sex man
like all the others. Nasty man.

556
00:41:19,535 --> 00:41:21,594
-You`re a nasty, bad man.
-Look...

557
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:24,102
...l tried to do your mama
a favor, you booger.

558
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:26,901
You probably wanna kiss her,
don`t you?

559
00:41:27,076 --> 00:41:29,840
Look, look. Off the glass.
Off the glass.

560
00:41:30,646 --> 00:41:32,910
And you, open this door.

561
00:41:33,082 --> 00:41:34,674
You forgot the magic word.

562
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:38,750
-Open this damn door.
-You just swore again.

563
00:41:38,921 --> 00:41:41,981
-Lindsey, he just swore again.
-So what?

564
00:41:42,157 --> 00:41:45,354
-Hey, l`m not playing with you.
-You can`t make us do anything.

565
00:41:45,794 --> 00:41:47,625
Hey, this is my car!

566
00:41:47,796 --> 00:41:50,094
You hear me, little girl?
This is my car!

567
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:55,065
You better not.
Look at me. l`m serious.

568
00:41:55,671 --> 00:41:58,765
l`m not playing with you,
little girl, okay?

569
00:41:59,108 --> 00:42:01,508
lf you don`t open up
before l count to three...

570
00:42:01,677 --> 00:42:02,939
...somebody gonna get it.

571
00:42:05,047 --> 00:42:06,480
One.

572
00:42:09,018 --> 00:42:10,383
Two.

573
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:12,916
Three.

574
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:16,890
No! No!
Hey, you stop that car!

575
00:42:20,362 --> 00:42:22,091
Where did he go?

576
00:42:24,366 --> 00:42:26,266
-Now you gonna get it!
-Go! Floor it!

577
00:42:26,735 --> 00:42:28,566
Get out of there!
Whoa! Hey!

578
00:42:29,038 --> 00:42:31,199
Stop! Wait a minute!

579
00:42:31,373 --> 00:42:34,069
l don`t have
any insurance on you, girl!

580
00:42:34,243 --> 00:42:35,574
Hey!

581
00:42:36,211 --> 00:42:39,669
Watch what you`re doing!
Watch the spinners!

582
00:42:40,015 --> 00:42:42,040
You`re messing up my spinners!

583
00:42:42,217 --> 00:42:44,811
-You know how much they cost?
-You can`t catch us.

584
00:42:45,487 --> 00:42:46,954
No!

585
00:42:52,494 --> 00:42:54,553
You little-- Give me them keys!

586
00:42:54,730 --> 00:42:57,130
-Dirty sex man.
-What y`all think you`re doing?

587
00:42:57,299 --> 00:43:00,291
Let go of my hat!
Give me them keys!

588
00:43:03,105 --> 00:43:05,266
Hey, Lindsey, stop this crazy thing!

589
00:43:05,441 --> 00:43:08,274
That man`s setting a bad example
for them kids.

590
00:43:08,444 --> 00:43:09,706
-Wait a minute!
-Go! Go!

591
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:23,350
Now that`s frontier justice.

592
00:43:54,356 --> 00:43:56,347
-Hey, turn up the rear heat.
-Yeah.

593
00:43:56,525 --> 00:43:58,049
No. No heat.

594
00:43:58,227 --> 00:44:00,752
No talking.
You`re lucky l`m letting you live.

595
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:02,920
-But--
-But my butt.

596
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:05,658
l should pull off
on the side of the road...

597
00:44:05,834 --> 00:44:07,995
...dig a hole,
and bury both you two.

598
00:44:08,504 --> 00:44:10,404
That`s what l should do. Yeah.

599
00:44:10,572 --> 00:44:13,666
A hundred years from now,
a grizzly will find your bones...

600
00:44:13,842 --> 00:44:16,436
...and pick his teeth with them.
Wouldn`t like that.

601
00:44:16,745 --> 00:44:19,407
Can`t believe you two.
Are you crazy?

602
00:44:19,915 --> 00:44:22,440
-We have rights.
-No, no, you have no rights.

603
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:29,013
This is my ship, buddy.
l`m the CEO of this SUV.

604
00:44:29,191 --> 00:44:30,749
Believe that.

605
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:35,621
Breaker, breaker, 26, this is Big Al
out on Highway 5, mile marker 1 6.

606
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:39,165
l got two little lambs here been
snatched up by the big, bad wolf.

607
00:44:39,334 --> 00:44:41,700
l need some backup, pronto.

608
00:44:43,272 --> 00:44:45,365
Ten-four, Big Al.
Let`s squash this bug.

609
00:44:46,408 --> 00:44:50,970
You had no consideration
for my life, your life or my spinners.

610
00:44:55,417 --> 00:44:56,941
What? What do you want?

611
00:44:57,119 --> 00:44:59,053
l`m driving here!

612
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:14,669
Mister ln-a-Hurry. ldiot.

613
00:45:20,142 --> 00:45:21,769
Why is he slowing down?

614
00:45:31,487 --> 00:45:33,114
l don`t like this.

615
00:45:33,489 --> 00:45:36,424
Pull over right now.
Pull it over. Pull it over.

616
00:45:36,592 --> 00:45:39,254
-You better do what he says.
-Like hell l will.

617
00:45:39,428 --> 00:45:41,623
l`ve seen those vigilante
trucker movies.

618
00:45:43,465 --> 00:45:45,296
l said, pull over!

619
00:45:47,102 --> 00:45:48,592
What you doing?

620
00:45:49,138 --> 00:45:50,469
Oh, no!

621
00:45:56,612 --> 00:45:58,307
My paint!

622
00:46:00,783 --> 00:46:02,307
You think you got me boxed in?

623
00:46:02,651 --> 00:46:06,109
Well, you can kiss my 330
cubic inches of V8 power, sucker!

624
00:46:07,156 --> 00:46:08,646
Hold on.

625
00:46:27,976 --> 00:46:29,375
Help!

626
00:46:32,214 --> 00:46:34,978
Your insurance premiums
are going through the roof.

627
00:47:23,198 --> 00:47:26,065
No! No! No!

628
00:47:27,836 --> 00:47:29,701
What was Mom thinking?

629
00:47:29,872 --> 00:47:33,069
l don`t know. l like him.
He`s kind of funny.

630
00:47:33,242 --> 00:47:34,834
Hey, don`t get soft.

631
00:47:35,010 --> 00:47:38,468
This man is not our daddy.
He`s the enemy.

632
00:47:40,749 --> 00:47:43,217
Take me now! Take me now!

633
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:46,917
This is why we don`t
come to the city.

634
00:50:26,415 --> 00:50:27,404
Come on.

635
00:50:27,783 --> 00:50:30,445
Come on. Get! Go!

636
00:50:33,355 --> 00:50:35,585
Come on, fleabag.

637
00:50:38,593 --> 00:50:40,060
No way!

638
00:50:40,228 --> 00:50:43,720
What? Now, get your narrow
butts on this horse now!

639
00:50:50,238 --> 00:50:53,730
-Hey, how you doing, baby?
-Hi. ls everything okay?

640
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:56,838
Oh, yeah, everything is cool.

641
00:50:57,012 --> 00:50:58,502
Can l call you right back?

642
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:01,080
Wait, what`s that sound?
You sound very jiggly.

643
00:51:02,484 --> 00:51:05,009
Must be your phone.
Everything`s cool on this end.

644
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:08,179
-Are you gonna be here soon?
-Sort of. Kind of.

645
00:51:09,458 --> 00:51:11,187
Let me call you back
in 1 0 minutes.

646
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:13,520
Wait, wait, l wanna say hi
to the kids.

647
00:51:13,995 --> 00:51:15,462
Oh, okay.

648
00:51:15,997 --> 00:51:19,364
She wanna talk to you guys
and make sure everything is all right.

649
00:51:21,736 --> 00:51:23,636
-Hi, Mom.
-Hey.

650
00:51:23,805 --> 00:51:25,500
Hi, babies. How are you doing?

651
00:51:25,674 --> 00:51:28,108
-Are you having fun with Nick?
-Come on.

652
00:51:28,577 --> 00:51:30,511
Hit the turbo!

653
00:51:30,745 --> 00:51:33,373
Let`s go! Let`s go!

654
00:51:37,152 --> 00:51:40,485
l know, baby, but just try
to make the best of it, okay?

655
00:51:40,655 --> 00:51:44,352
-I love you.
-Love you too. Bye.

656
00:51:48,697 --> 00:51:51,860
-Scoot over, l`m coming aboard.
-That`s a bad idea.

657
00:51:52,033 --> 00:51:53,660
-Says who?
-Says the guy...

658
00:51:53,835 --> 00:51:55,427
...who put all that junk there.

659
00:51:56,471 --> 00:51:57,961
Oh, snap!

660
00:52:12,721 --> 00:52:14,586
l hate horses.

661
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:22,518
What take so long?
l have to hang mirror ball.

662
00:52:34,976 --> 00:52:37,638
You little snotty-nosed runts.

663
00:52:37,812 --> 00:52:39,473
l know exactly where you are.

664
00:52:39,648 --> 00:52:41,673
You messing with
Nick the Quick, baby.

665
00:52:41,850 --> 00:52:44,944
Now`s your chance. Hit yourself
over the head with a brick...

666
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:47,418
...and say that they were kidnapped.

667
00:52:47,589 --> 00:52:49,056
Shut up.

668
00:52:53,762 --> 00:52:55,821
Happy New Year.

669
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:07,805
You think Nick`s okay?

670
00:53:07,976 --> 00:53:09,944
What are you worried
about him for?

671
00:53:10,111 --> 00:53:12,807
l`m not. lt`s just...

672
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:14,710
...maybe we were a little rough.

673
00:53:14,883 --> 00:53:16,111
Oh, please.

674
00:53:16,284 --> 00:53:19,447
That player got what he deserved.

675
00:53:19,621 --> 00:53:21,680
``Get your butts on this horse.``

676
00:53:21,856 --> 00:53:24,416
``You got $400?``

677
00:53:27,963 --> 00:53:30,932
l`ve been thinking. We should`ve
brought soup or something.

678
00:53:31,099 --> 00:53:32,327
What for?

679
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:35,333
Because Dad`s sick.
What is he gonna eat?

680
00:53:35,503 --> 00:53:37,403
He`s a dad.
l`m sure he has soup.

681
00:53:37,973 --> 00:53:40,874
He must be lonely,
living all by himself.

682
00:53:41,042 --> 00:53:42,634
Look, don`t bug him about that.

683
00:53:42,811 --> 00:53:46,076
lf we want him to hook up with Mom,
we have to be subtle. Got it?

684
00:53:46,248 --> 00:53:47,806
l got it.

685
00:54:24,085 --> 00:54:26,713
Come on, y`all.
Let`s get out of here.

686
00:55:00,622 --> 00:55:03,420
Want some chocolate cake?
lt`s world-famous.

687
00:55:03,591 --> 00:55:05,855
Mom says l shouldn`t have sugar.

688
00:55:08,396 --> 00:55:11,229
What about you?
lt`ll make your mouth all chocolatey.

689
00:55:12,133 --> 00:55:13,361
No, thanks.

690
00:55:44,733 --> 00:55:47,224
Hey. You forgot something.

691
00:55:55,043 --> 00:55:57,375
Sorry about what happened today.

692
00:55:58,246 --> 00:56:00,840
l really wish you guys
didn`t have to see that.

693
00:56:02,617 --> 00:56:04,744
He used to look at me like that.

694
00:56:05,954 --> 00:56:07,615
l know, man.

695
00:56:09,657 --> 00:56:12,785
And when he hugged you,
you thought he`d never let you go.

696
00:56:13,828 --> 00:56:17,229
They make you laugh,
they tell you they love you...

697
00:56:17,399 --> 00:56:19,367
...then one day,
they never come back.

698
00:56:20,602 --> 00:56:23,366
l bet you know all about leaving,
don`t you, player?

699
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:28,402
Know what?
As a matter of fact, l do.

700
00:56:29,844 --> 00:56:33,245
But only because the same thing
happened to me when l was your age.

701
00:56:34,182 --> 00:56:36,173
Yeah, my pops
walked out on us too.

702
00:56:38,887 --> 00:56:41,549
lt`s a shame that anybody
can call theyself a father.

703
00:56:41,990 --> 00:56:43,287
But listen...

704
00:56:43,458 --> 00:56:45,858
...he`s the failure in this, not you.

705
00:56:46,561 --> 00:56:48,756
He`s the one that`s gonna miss out.

706
00:56:49,864 --> 00:56:53,857
l just hope it don`t take you guys as
long as it took me to figure that out...

707
00:56:54,235 --> 00:56:57,466
...because it`s true.
You guys are some cool kids.

708
00:57:01,676 --> 00:57:04,509
There you go.
Come on, let`s get out of here.

709
00:57:21,129 --> 00:57:23,529
-Nick?
-What`s up, little man?

710
00:57:24,165 --> 00:57:27,601
lf my dad left and your dad left...

711
00:57:28,036 --> 00:57:30,596
...does that mean
l`ll end up like you?

712
00:57:31,473 --> 00:57:34,340
l ain`t doing too bad.
Look, l have blingage.

713
00:57:34,709 --> 00:57:36,336
That`s not exactly what l meant.

714
00:57:36,778 --> 00:57:40,407
l was watching Oprah, and it was
all about how depressed and lonely...

715
00:57:40,582 --> 00:57:43,710
-...bachelors like you are.
-But l`m not depressed or lonely.

716
00:57:43,885 --> 00:57:45,512
-Yes, you are.
-No, l`m not.

717
00:57:45,687 --> 00:57:47,348
-Yes, you are.
-No, l`m not.

718
00:57:47,522 --> 00:57:50,753
Mom says that if a man is
not married by the time he`s 35...

719
00:57:51,025 --> 00:57:53,755
-...he`s either damaged or gay.
-What?

720
00:57:54,562 --> 00:57:56,553
Well, that would explain
those earrings.

721
00:57:57,332 --> 00:57:58,526
Watch it, sucker.

722
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:01,225
But you do have intimacy issues,
don`t you?

723
00:58:01,402 --> 00:58:02,926
-No, l don`t.
-Yes, you do.

724
00:58:03,104 --> 00:58:04,435
-No, l don`t.
-Yes, you do.

725
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:06,836
Look, it`s obvious
you need a timeout...

726
00:58:07,008 --> 00:58:08,839
...and you need
a little tickle time.

727
00:58:09,010 --> 00:58:13,709
Because all you do is ask
a thousand questions, huh?

728
00:58:14,382 --> 00:58:16,247
Hey. Are you all right?

729
00:58:20,188 --> 00:58:21,712
Kevin.

730
00:58:26,094 --> 00:58:28,358
l`m good.

731
00:58:28,530 --> 00:58:31,727
-You sure?
-Yeah, except...

732
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:34,562
-...l`m out.
-Okay, don`t worry about that.

733
00:58:34,736 --> 00:58:36,636
We`ll get you more
once we get there.

734
00:58:36,938 --> 00:58:38,633
Oh, sure, we can wait...

735
00:58:38,806 --> 00:58:40,706
...if you want me to die!

736
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:51,085
They`re closing!
Do something, Nick.

737
00:58:51,252 --> 00:58:54,153
No, no, wait. Hold on!
Wait a minute. We need a refill.

738
00:58:54,322 --> 00:58:56,688
Sorry, we`re closed.
Come back Tuesday.

739
00:58:56,858 --> 00:58:58,826
But l got a sick kid here.

740
00:59:01,629 --> 00:59:04,598
Look, l couldn`t help you
even if l wanted to.

741
00:59:04,766 --> 00:59:06,791
The pharmacist
has left for the holiday.

742
00:59:06,968 --> 00:59:09,402
-Well, where is he?
-He`s off duty.

743
00:59:09,671 --> 00:59:13,471
And l doubt very much he`s gonna
want some guy interrupting his holi--

744
00:59:16,844 --> 00:59:19,369
Just a second, sir,
and l`ll draw you up a map.

745
00:59:25,186 --> 00:59:27,746
Hey, Nick, that guy
was such a meanie.

746
00:59:27,922 --> 00:59:29,947
How`d you get him
to do what you wanted?

747
00:59:30,124 --> 00:59:32,888
Oh, that was simple.
l just gave him the look.

748
00:59:33,061 --> 00:59:34,460
lt works every time.

749
00:59:34,629 --> 00:59:37,996
-lt even worked through glass?
-Oh, yeah.

750
00:59:38,166 --> 00:59:40,794
The look is something
l developed when l was a kid.

751
00:59:40,969 --> 00:59:42,664
l had somewhat of a reputation.

752
00:59:42,837 --> 00:59:44,930
Surprise, surprise.

753
00:59:45,106 --> 00:59:48,598
l don`t want everybody stepping
to me, so l give them the look...

754
00:59:48,776 --> 00:59:50,471
...which told them, ``Back off.

755
00:59:50,645 --> 00:59:53,409
That`s a bad mother--``
``Shut your mouth.``

756
00:59:53,581 --> 00:59:55,640
l wish l could do that.

757
00:59:55,817 --> 00:59:57,944
You got somebody
bothering you at school?

758
00:59:58,119 --> 01:00:01,111
An asthmatic in the accelerated
program? What do you think?

759
01:00:04,759 --> 01:00:07,557
Try this. lt`s foolproof.

760
01:00:09,998 --> 01:00:12,558
No, no, check the lip,
check the lip.

761
01:00:16,638 --> 01:00:18,572
Man, do not take my lunch money.

762
01:00:20,208 --> 01:00:22,676
Here we go, killer. Come on.

763
01:00:35,289 --> 01:00:37,382
Hey, hey, where y`all going?

764
01:00:40,528 --> 01:00:43,053
Excuse me, l`m looking
for the pharmacist.

765
01:00:43,364 --> 01:00:44,695
Delwyn? Sure.

766
01:00:44,866 --> 01:00:46,891
He`s....

767
01:00:47,068 --> 01:00:49,332
-He`s right over there.
-That`s enough.

768
01:00:49,504 --> 01:00:50,937
-l got it.
-Give me that.

769
01:00:51,506 --> 01:00:53,872
Stop clowning around now.

770
01:00:54,042 --> 01:00:55,634
-Yo.
-Give me my shoe.

771
01:00:55,810 --> 01:00:58,074
Yo. Excuse me,
are you the pharmacist?

772
01:00:58,813 --> 01:01:00,474
Not at the moment. Why?

773
01:01:00,782 --> 01:01:04,115
Well, look, l got a kid with me, man.
He`s got asthma real bad.

774
01:01:05,787 --> 01:01:08,153
Try some steam.
That usually helps.

775
01:01:08,322 --> 01:01:10,415
Hey, hey. Knock it off.

776
01:01:10,591 --> 01:01:12,684
-Steam?
-That`s enough of that.

777
01:01:12,860 --> 01:01:17,490
Look, look, all l need is a refill, okay?
And l know you can help.

778
01:01:17,665 --> 01:01:19,997
l`m asking you nice.

779
01:01:21,369 --> 01:01:25,430
Mister, l`ve been married
for 38 years. You can`t scare me.

780
01:01:25,606 --> 01:01:29,269
Come on, man, you the pharmacist.
l know you took a oath or something.

781
01:01:29,777 --> 01:01:31,506
Not that l can remember, no.

782
01:01:31,679 --> 01:01:34,079
Hey, will you go over there
and behave yourself?

783
01:01:34,248 --> 01:01:36,341
Yeah, go get him over there.

784
01:01:37,452 --> 01:01:39,647
You know, folks around here
like to barter.

785
01:01:40,121 --> 01:01:42,248
You get what you want,
l get what l want.

786
01:01:42,423 --> 01:01:46,052
One hand washes the other.
l scratch your back--

787
01:01:46,227 --> 01:01:47,990
Get to the point.

788
01:01:50,665 --> 01:01:52,792
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
you can`t clown me.

789
01:01:53,367 --> 01:01:54,766
Watch the kids.

790
01:01:55,603 --> 01:01:57,366
All of them?

791
01:02:02,176 --> 01:02:03,734
You little--

792
01:02:06,914 --> 01:02:08,404
Oh, my word.

793
01:02:08,583 --> 01:02:11,017
Pie and cake and brownies and pie.

794
01:02:11,185 --> 01:02:12,584
You said ``pie`` twice.

795
01:02:12,754 --> 01:02:14,278
l like pie.

796
01:02:14,956 --> 01:02:16,947
Kevin, you know Mom
would be upset...

797
01:02:17,125 --> 01:02:20,561
...if we were even thinking
about trying any of these...

798
01:02:20,795 --> 01:02:22,820
...chocolatey...

799
01:02:22,997 --> 01:02:24,658
...creamy...

800
01:02:25,366 --> 01:02:27,061
...delicious....

801
01:02:29,070 --> 01:02:31,334
Hey, l was gonna eat
those brownies.

802
01:02:31,506 --> 01:02:33,497
What? Just take those.

803
01:02:33,674 --> 01:02:35,335
No, l want yours.

804
01:02:48,990 --> 01:02:50,321
Take it easy, man.

805
01:02:53,261 --> 01:02:54,660
Sorry.

806
01:03:15,082 --> 01:03:16,413
Ridiculous.

807
01:03:16,584 --> 01:03:18,882
What? l got this.

808
01:03:24,192 --> 01:03:26,888
All right, timeout. Get off of him.

809
01:03:27,061 --> 01:03:29,256
Get off of him.
Get out of here.

810
01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:31,990
Get off of him, you little gangsters.
Watch out.

811
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:34,960
You too! Off of him!

812
01:03:35,136 --> 01:03:37,366
What is wrong with you kids?

813
01:03:37,538 --> 01:03:40,200
Why y`all ganging up on him?

814
01:03:40,641 --> 01:03:41,869
You think you so tough?

815
01:03:43,744 --> 01:03:46,269
l`d like to see you try that
with somebody my size.

816
01:03:49,851 --> 01:03:51,375
Okay! Okay, man!

817
01:03:51,552 --> 01:03:53,986
All right, get off me,
you little maggots!

818
01:03:54,755 --> 01:03:58,020
-Do you think we should help him?
-l`m getting mad now. Hey!

819
01:03:58,826 --> 01:04:00,487
-After this bite.
-Hey, that`s it.

820
01:04:00,661 --> 01:04:02,788
Now, l`m gonna count to three.

821
01:04:03,931 --> 01:04:05,558
Hey, wait a minute!

822
01:04:05,733 --> 01:04:07,530
Okay! Get off!

823
01:04:07,702 --> 01:04:10,569
My shoe!
Come back here with my shoe.

824
01:04:18,746 --> 01:04:21,271
All right, people,
it`s time for some karaoke.

825
01:04:22,884 --> 01:04:24,249
What is she doing?

826
01:04:36,864 --> 01:04:38,229
She can sing?

827
01:04:51,946 --> 01:04:53,345
She can sing.

828
01:06:28,442 --> 01:06:31,377
Kevin, enough. Kevin, please.

829
01:06:34,749 --> 01:06:38,310
l didn`t know you could sing that good.
Why you didn`t say nothing?

830
01:06:38,486 --> 01:06:40,852
Because before,
you were the enemy.

831
01:06:41,422 --> 01:06:45,791
You know who can sing?
Galaktico can sing.

832
01:06:47,328 --> 01:06:48,852
Hey.

833
01:06:49,030 --> 01:06:51,260
Okay. All right, okay, okay.

834
01:06:51,432 --> 01:06:54,230
Put that down, settle down
and put on your seat belt.

835
01:06:54,468 --> 01:06:56,766
l know why your mama
won`t let you have sugar.

836
01:06:57,071 --> 01:06:59,869
Hyper down. You`re like some kind
of crazy dog.

837
01:07:00,341 --> 01:07:03,902
l know you are,
but what am l, Rover?

838
01:07:08,716 --> 01:07:11,480
Nick, l don`t feel so good.

839
01:07:12,019 --> 01:07:14,351
Do you got anything to drink?

840
01:07:17,892 --> 01:07:19,484
There you go.

841
01:07:21,729 --> 01:07:26,063
l`m sorry, Nick, l accidentally
spilled a drop on the floor.

842
01:07:26,233 --> 01:07:28,531
Little man,
don`t even worry about it.

843
01:07:28,702 --> 01:07:31,136
There`s nothing more
that you can do to this car.

844
01:07:34,508 --> 01:07:35,770
Oh, no!

845
01:07:36,143 --> 01:07:39,078
l can`t see. l can`t see!

846
01:07:47,588 --> 01:07:49,647
ls everybody all right?

847
01:07:49,824 --> 01:07:52,725
l feel much better now.

848
01:07:56,497 --> 01:08:00,092
Nick, where are my kids? You were
supposed to be here two hours ago.

849
01:08:00,267 --> 01:08:02,292
We had a slight delay at the border.

850
01:08:02,470 --> 01:08:04,199
We`re gonna need
more paper towels.

851
01:08:04,371 --> 01:08:05,963
Paper towels?
What`s going on?

852
01:08:06,307 --> 01:08:09,299
Nothing. We just pulled over
to clean out the Navigator.

853
01:08:09,477 --> 01:08:10,739
Are you kidding me?

854
01:08:10,911 --> 01:08:14,677
lt`s freezing outside, and you`ve got
my kids cleaning your precious car?

855
01:08:14,849 --> 01:08:16,840
Suzanne, it`s not like it seems, okay?

856
01:08:17,017 --> 01:08:18,848
Well, it sounds pretty bad
from here.

857
01:08:19,420 --> 01:08:23,720
Nick, if you`re not here by 8:00,
you`re gonna be in big trouble.

858
01:08:24,058 --> 01:08:27,459
-Suzanne, I got this.
-Eight o`clock, Nick.

859
01:08:29,130 --> 01:08:32,531
All right, guys, we gotta hustle.
Your mom`s getting worried.

860
01:08:32,700 --> 01:08:36,192
-But it stinks in here.
-Hold your breath.

861
01:08:36,837 --> 01:08:38,065
What?

862
01:08:38,239 --> 01:08:39,797
lf we don`t move...

863
01:08:39,974 --> 01:08:41,566
...maybe it won`t kill us.

864
01:08:44,311 --> 01:08:46,541
Oh, man, you`re scared of that deer?

865
01:08:47,047 --> 01:08:49,311
He ain`t gonna hurt you.

866
01:08:49,483 --> 01:08:52,919
They come out of the woods when
they get cold. He`s probably hungry.

867
01:08:53,087 --> 01:08:54,554
Try this.

868
01:08:59,059 --> 01:09:03,928
-Hey. Look what l got.
-Nick, deers are herbivores.

869
01:09:04,098 --> 01:09:06,760
So what?
Everybody loves chocolate chip.

870
01:09:08,102 --> 01:09:10,730
Hey, buddy, come on.

871
01:09:11,071 --> 01:09:13,266
Cookie.

872
01:09:15,609 --> 01:09:17,509
Okay, okay, hey, hey,
come on.

873
01:09:18,145 --> 01:09:20,272
-No.
-What? He`s not gonna hurt you.

874
01:09:20,714 --> 01:09:24,445
Look, l`m right here with you.
Come on, come on. Come on.

875
01:09:24,618 --> 01:09:26,449
Slow. Come on.

876
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:29,180
Slowly. Don`t scare it. Get in there.

877
01:09:29,356 --> 01:09:32,348
-What if he`s rabid?
-Come on, come on. There we go.

878
01:09:32,526 --> 01:09:34,551
There you go. There you go.

879
01:09:35,095 --> 01:09:38,064
See, he`s gentle.
He`s not gonna hurt you.

880
01:09:38,232 --> 01:09:39,893
-Give him another.
-No way.

881
01:09:40,067 --> 01:09:41,659
-Now, look.
-Where`s my camera?

882
01:09:49,476 --> 01:09:51,341
Hey, hey. Hey.

883
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:55,412
Down, boy. Sit.

884
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:57,483
Hey, Bambi. Sit!

885
01:10:00,087 --> 01:10:01,748
Come on, now.

886
01:10:01,922 --> 01:10:03,617
Bambi.

887
01:10:05,593 --> 01:10:08,118
Give him the look, Nick!
Give him the look!

888
01:10:08,295 --> 01:10:10,661
All right, you want a piece of me?

889
01:10:16,070 --> 01:10:18,300
Say uncle. Are you done?

890
01:10:18,472 --> 01:10:20,440
Your head gotta go
over my fireplace?

891
01:10:20,608 --> 01:10:23,441
-Show him who`s boss, Nick.
-Now, just let it go.

892
01:10:23,611 --> 01:10:26,079
Let it go.

893
01:10:26,247 --> 01:10:29,273
Now, get your tail out of here
before l kick some deer butt.

894
01:10:29,450 --> 01:10:31,179
You better run.

895
01:10:36,323 --> 01:10:38,791
-l hope you got some nice shots.
-Yep.

896
01:10:39,226 --> 01:10:41,626
Now help me find my keys.

897
01:10:42,263 --> 01:10:44,424
Come on out of there.

898
01:10:49,737 --> 01:10:51,295
lf your mama ever asks...

899
01:10:51,472 --> 01:10:54,305
...don`t let her know
l know how to hot-wire a car.

900
01:10:54,608 --> 01:10:56,337
But you don`t know how to do it.

901
01:10:56,744 --> 01:10:59,235
Quiet down out there.

902
01:10:59,413 --> 01:11:01,472
Have patience.

903
01:11:06,453 --> 01:11:08,819
-Turn it off, Nick!
-All right, calm down.

904
01:11:08,989 --> 01:11:11,890
-Hurry up. lt`s loud.
-And scary.

905
01:11:12,226 --> 01:11:14,091
This should do it.

906
01:11:22,303 --> 01:11:25,067
-Nick, the car`s on fire. lt`s burning.
-Oh, no.

907
01:11:25,472 --> 01:11:28,236
lt`s gonna burn. Nick, hurry.

908
01:11:28,409 --> 01:11:31,901
-Be careful.
-Come on, Nick, do it.

909
01:11:32,346 --> 01:11:33,745
Put it out! Put it out!

910
01:11:36,016 --> 01:11:38,746
lt`s gonna burn, Nick! Hurry!

911
01:11:38,919 --> 01:11:41,012
This could be toxic.

912
01:11:41,188 --> 01:11:42,985
Worthless.

913
01:11:43,157 --> 01:11:45,557
-Galaktico!
-Kevin, step back. l got it.

914
01:11:47,261 --> 01:11:50,196
Hey, Nick, don`t forget me.
l`m over here.

915
01:11:50,364 --> 01:11:52,093
l`m on the dashboard, remember?

916
01:11:52,266 --> 01:11:54,928
Hey! Don`t let me burn!

917
01:11:55,102 --> 01:11:57,036
l`m a limited edition!

918
01:11:59,206 --> 01:12:02,937
Oh, man.
l never even got to read the manual.

919
01:12:13,554 --> 01:12:15,522
Hit the dirt!

920
01:12:28,602 --> 01:12:30,627
Why?

921
01:12:31,472 --> 01:12:33,099
Oh, no.

922
01:12:34,708 --> 01:12:37,268
This is about a year`s pay.

923
01:12:38,479 --> 01:12:40,310
What did l do?

924
01:12:40,481 --> 01:12:43,177
What did l do?
Why is this happening to me?

925
01:12:47,154 --> 01:12:48,553
lt was you two.

926
01:12:48,722 --> 01:12:51,885
lf l didn`t volunteer to babysit
you two little demons...

927
01:12:52,059 --> 01:12:55,392
...this wouldn`t have never happened,
and l`d still have my car.

928
01:12:58,799 --> 01:13:01,359
Go ahead and cry. l don`t care.

929
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:08,433
Okay, all right, stop the waterworks.

930
01:13:10,611 --> 01:13:13,774
Oh, all right. Oh, come on,
come on.

931
01:13:14,548 --> 01:13:17,984
Stop crying. Stop crying.

932
01:13:18,152 --> 01:13:20,780
lt`s not your fault. lt`s not your fault.

933
01:13:20,954 --> 01:13:25,050
No, no. l just got
a little upset, okay?

934
01:13:25,225 --> 01:13:27,193
That`s why you buy insurance.

935
01:13:27,361 --> 01:13:29,989
All right, let`s sit down. Sit down.
Come on, now.

936
01:13:30,164 --> 01:13:33,793
Right here, right here.
lt`s only a car, okay?

937
01:13:34,201 --> 01:13:36,226
We are a lot of trouble.

938
01:13:36,403 --> 01:13:39,304
That`s why our daddy
doesn`t wanna be with us.

939
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:41,440
Whoa, whoa.

940
01:13:41,608 --> 01:13:43,405
Look at me.

941
01:13:43,577 --> 01:13:45,636
Don`t say that. That`s not true.

942
01:13:45,813 --> 01:13:47,713
But we destroyed your Navigator.

943
01:13:48,415 --> 01:13:51,873
That? Oh, that`s nothing.

944
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:55,987
That`s just a material object.

945
01:13:56,557 --> 01:13:57,854
lt means nothing.

946
01:13:58,025 --> 01:14:00,516
l wouldn`t wanna spend New Year`s
with us either.

947
01:14:01,128 --> 01:14:02,823
Who would?

948
01:14:04,832 --> 01:14:06,800
Me.

949
01:14:07,434 --> 01:14:08,992
l would.

950
01:14:10,537 --> 01:14:12,630
But you know what?

951
01:14:12,806 --> 01:14:15,297
Maybe your mother`s right,
you know.

952
01:14:15,476 --> 01:14:17,034
Maybe l`m not cut out for this.

953
01:14:17,344 --> 01:14:19,710
l mean, look at you two.
You`re a mess.

954
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:23,145
l keep losing you,
feeding you the wrong stuff.

955
01:14:23,917 --> 01:14:27,011
lf you were goldfish,
you`d be dead.

956
01:14:27,988 --> 01:14:31,389
You know, you`re doing okay.
This is just your first day.

957
01:14:31,692 --> 01:14:35,025
Yeah, you have to get experience.
You`ll get used to it.

958
01:14:35,195 --> 01:14:37,561
Yeah, and there`s books
you can read too.

959
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:41,358
Thanks.

960
01:14:41,535 --> 01:14:42,832
But you know what?

961
01:14:43,270 --> 01:14:45,704
lf we`re not magically in front
of your mother...

962
01:14:45,873 --> 01:14:47,864
...in the next 30 minutes or so...

963
01:14:48,041 --> 01:14:49,838
...she`ll never talk to me again.

964
01:14:50,010 --> 01:14:54,208
Hey, if it`s the bottom of the ninth, and
you`re down two runs, do you quit?

965
01:14:54,381 --> 01:14:58,215
No. You put that ball back on the tee,
and you keep swinging.

966
01:15:03,390 --> 01:15:05,483
Well, let`s keep swinging.

967
01:15:05,659 --> 01:15:08,685
Come on. Let`s go.

968
01:15:11,131 --> 01:15:14,794
Now we gotta figure out how
we gonna get to Vancouver.

969
01:15:16,270 --> 01:15:19,171
Hey, look.

970
01:15:19,339 --> 01:15:21,534
l found your keys, Nick.

971
01:15:22,276 --> 01:15:24,107
What?

972
01:15:24,278 --> 01:15:26,610
lt`s just my luck.

973
01:15:35,055 --> 01:15:37,182
Let`s get out of here.

974
01:15:39,126 --> 01:15:41,526
-Come on.
-Right here, baby. Come on, now.

975
01:15:44,698 --> 01:15:46,029
Yo, yo, yo, hey!

976
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:48,631
You got one.

977
01:15:54,207 --> 01:15:55,606
Oh, man, thanks.

978
01:15:55,776 --> 01:16:00,008
We`re on our way to Vancouver,
and l really, really appreciate this.

979
01:16:00,180 --> 01:16:02,671
l couldn`t leave these kids
here on the highway.

980
01:16:03,050 --> 01:16:06,417
That`s why l`m leaving you,
you animal!

981
01:16:07,087 --> 01:16:09,954
Wait a minute!
Come back here, you hillbilly!

982
01:16:10,123 --> 01:16:11,488
Come here!

983
01:16:12,726 --> 01:16:14,887
No. Let me in. Let--

984
01:16:17,598 --> 01:16:21,125
Hey, yo, bring me back my kids!

985
01:16:31,111 --> 01:16:32,601
Stop.

986
01:16:34,948 --> 01:16:36,176
Mister, are you crazy?

987
01:16:36,350 --> 01:16:39,114
Some psycho trucker took my kids.
We gotta catch him.

988
01:16:39,286 --> 01:16:42,585
Well, hop aboard. l`ll help you.
Ernst to the rescue.

989
01:16:46,393 --> 01:16:49,988
Suzanne, they`ll be here any minute.
l`m sure they`re fine.

990
01:16:50,163 --> 01:16:53,189
Now, let`s concentrate on the party.

991
01:17:03,844 --> 01:17:05,709
We were completely wrong
about Nick.

992
01:17:06,246 --> 01:17:10,580
Yeah, but now we know
he`s kind and gentle.

993
01:17:10,751 --> 01:17:14,710
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on, slim, get me closer.

994
01:17:14,888 --> 01:17:16,321
-Come on, Nick.
-l got it.

995
01:17:16,490 --> 01:17:17,923
-Get off.
-Open up, you jerk.

996
01:17:18,091 --> 01:17:19,718
Nick, save us! Help!

997
01:17:19,893 --> 01:17:21,326
-Stop this truck!
-Get off!

998
01:17:21,495 --> 01:17:23,827
-You lunatic!
-Stop this truck!

999
01:17:25,866 --> 01:17:27,891
Kind and gentle, huh?

1000
01:17:31,238 --> 01:17:32,933
-Go, man.
-l`m moving.

1001
01:17:33,106 --> 01:17:35,006
This thing wasn`t built for speed.

1002
01:17:38,945 --> 01:17:41,106
Come on,
you`re driving like a old lady.

1003
01:17:41,281 --> 01:17:44,079
No, no, you watch.
Ernst knows how to drive.

1004
01:17:50,023 --> 01:17:51,752
That`s what l`m talking about.

1005
01:17:51,925 --> 01:17:54,325
-Let us out now.
-We wanna go with Nick.

1006
01:17:54,494 --> 01:17:56,223
Let us out.

1007
01:17:57,631 --> 01:18:01,465
Come on, slim, don`t let him
push you around. Do it. Do it.

1008
01:18:04,638 --> 01:18:07,300
Dag-bernit, l`ve had enough of this.

1009
01:18:16,216 --> 01:18:19,379
-Come on, slim, they getting away.
-lt won`t turn over.

1010
01:18:20,921 --> 01:18:23,412
l can`t do anything about it.

1011
01:18:23,590 --> 01:18:24,921
l`m sorry.

1012
01:18:27,427 --> 01:18:30,760
Boy, it`s true. Never a cop around
when you need one.

1013
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:35,161
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?

1014
01:18:40,540 --> 01:18:41,734
Bad! Hit you!

1015
01:18:49,116 --> 01:18:50,276
-Geronimo!
-Geronimo!

1016
01:18:55,088 --> 01:18:57,716
-Look, it`s Elite Catering.
-This is Mom`s party.

1017
01:18:57,891 --> 01:18:59,358
Let`s go.

1018
01:19:10,837 --> 01:19:12,862
-Come on.
-l want some cotton candy.

1019
01:19:13,306 --> 01:19:15,433
-Got you.
-Run! Save yourself!

1020
01:19:16,543 --> 01:19:18,170
Wait. Wait.

1021
01:19:18,345 --> 01:19:20,313
At least slow down.

1022
01:19:23,617 --> 01:19:25,983
You two are a peck of trouble,
you know that?

1023
01:19:31,525 --> 01:19:33,686
Wait. l`m trying to protect you.

1024
01:19:34,427 --> 01:19:36,861
You`re going down, sucker.

1025
01:19:38,031 --> 01:19:39,828
Get off me.

1026
01:19:55,182 --> 01:19:56,979
Come on. Come on.

1027
01:19:59,653 --> 01:20:02,053
l`m gonna give you
a knuckle sandwich.

1028
01:20:04,224 --> 01:20:07,557
-Let me at him. Get your hands off me.
-What`s wrong with you two?

1029
01:20:07,828 --> 01:20:09,693
-He`s a kidnapper!
-He`s a kidnapper!

1030
01:20:09,863 --> 01:20:11,694
-He`s a kidnapper!
-He`s a kidnapper!

1031
01:20:11,865 --> 01:20:14,527
-Let me at him.
-Yeah. Nick, get him!

1032
01:20:14,701 --> 01:20:15,861
Police.

1033
01:20:28,181 --> 01:20:30,012
Mom!

1034
01:20:30,183 --> 01:20:32,845
Lindsey, honey.

1035
01:20:33,019 --> 01:20:37,149
Oh, baby, Mommy was so worried
about you. Are you okay?

1036
01:20:37,324 --> 01:20:40,122
Yep. Eight o`clock,
just like you said.

1037
01:20:40,293 --> 01:20:42,454
Now, where is your brother
and that Nick?

1038
01:20:43,730 --> 01:20:45,595
l left them by the ice-skating rink.

1039
01:20:45,765 --> 01:20:49,531
Now, l need to know what`s going
on here, and l want the truth.

1040
01:20:50,203 --> 01:20:54,799
The truth? l don`t think there`s time
for the truth.

1041
01:21:01,214 --> 01:21:02,613
Get him!

1042
01:21:02,782 --> 01:21:04,545
l`m the good guy. Get him.

1043
01:21:05,018 --> 01:21:07,053
Get your hands off me,
you stinking snowman.

1044
01:21:07,053 --> 01:21:07,781
Get your hands off me,
you stinking snowman.

1045
01:21:09,022 --> 01:21:10,785
Wait a minute.
You don`t understand.

1046
01:21:10,957 --> 01:21:15,894
l got permission from his mother
to bring him here. Kevin, tell him.

1047
01:21:16,062 --> 01:21:18,087
Kevin!

1048
01:21:24,604 --> 01:21:26,572
Let me go. He needs his inhaler.

1049
01:21:27,340 --> 01:21:28,830
Kevin. Kevin.

1050
01:21:29,009 --> 01:21:31,170
Oh, no. Come on, man.

1051
01:21:31,344 --> 01:21:33,175
Come on, Kevin.

1052
01:21:33,346 --> 01:21:35,177
Come on, man. Breathe.

1053
01:21:35,348 --> 01:21:37,179
Breathe, breathe.

1054
01:21:37,484 --> 01:21:39,679
Come on. Come on, breathe.

1055
01:21:40,053 --> 01:21:42,021
Kevin.

1056
01:21:43,356 --> 01:21:45,256
Kevin.

1057
01:21:51,097 --> 01:21:54,157
Don`t you ever scare me
like that again. You hear me?

1058
01:21:54,834 --> 01:21:56,995
Don`t you ever do that.

1059
01:21:57,170 --> 01:22:00,799
Maybe it won`t be so bad
to turn out like you after all.

1060
01:22:02,976 --> 01:22:04,409
Kevin!

1061
01:22:04,577 --> 01:22:07,774
-Mommy.
-Oh, Kevin, honey, come here.

1062
01:22:07,948 --> 01:22:11,042
l don`t know what Mommy was
thinking. l should`ve come home.

1063
01:22:11,217 --> 01:22:13,515
-Are you okay?
-lt`s okay, Mom. l`m fine.

1064
01:22:13,687 --> 01:22:15,154
Yeah, it`s okay. He`s fine.

1065
01:22:15,989 --> 01:22:17,684
You call this fine?

1066
01:22:17,857 --> 01:22:20,018
Look at this.
This is a catastrophe.

1067
01:22:20,193 --> 01:22:21,922
No, Suzanne,
you don`t understand.

1068
01:22:22,095 --> 01:22:24,996
-l mean, we-- Me and the kids--
-Nick, please.

1069
01:22:25,165 --> 01:22:26,826
lt`s bad enough as it is.

1070
01:22:30,737 --> 01:22:32,967
l really wanted to believe in you.

1071
01:22:35,041 --> 01:22:38,499
Ma`am, did this man have permission
to watch your children?

1072
01:22:43,316 --> 01:22:45,216
Yes.

1073
01:22:46,820 --> 01:22:49,687
But it was a mistake,
and it won`t happen again.

1074
01:22:56,663 --> 01:22:58,096
Come on, you guys.

1075
01:22:58,631 --> 01:23:00,155
-Suzanne, no.
-But, Mom--

1076
01:23:00,333 --> 01:23:03,427
l don`t wanna hear it.
l`m not in the mood to argue. Let`s go.

1077
01:23:03,603 --> 01:23:05,332
-Mommy.
-Let`s go.

1078
01:23:05,505 --> 01:23:07,097
Suzanne.

1079
01:23:16,349 --> 01:23:17,748
Nick.

1080
01:23:18,651 --> 01:23:20,346
Listen...

1081
01:23:20,820 --> 01:23:23,050
...l`m sorry for all the trouble.

1082
01:23:23,223 --> 01:23:27,853
lf you`re serious about heading home,
l`d be proud to give you a lift.

1083
01:23:28,762 --> 01:23:30,389
Appreciate that, Big Al.

1084
01:23:30,563 --> 01:23:32,554
l got my truck right--

1085
01:23:33,199 --> 01:23:37,226
Hey, what are you doing, you turkey?
You can`t tow my truck!

1086
01:23:37,404 --> 01:23:40,305
Put it down. l`m here.
Put it down right now.

1087
01:23:40,473 --> 01:23:42,134
Officers, arrest this man!

1088
01:23:50,316 --> 01:23:52,113
Yo, Nick.

1089
01:23:52,619 --> 01:23:54,211
Excuse me.

1090
01:23:54,387 --> 01:23:55,615
Hey, Nick, remember me?

1091
01:23:55,789 --> 01:23:58,553
l`m in here with a mint
stuck to my head.

1092
01:23:59,125 --> 01:24:00,456
Hey, brother.

1093
01:24:00,627 --> 01:24:04,393
What are you moping about?
You should be celebrating.

1094
01:24:04,564 --> 01:24:07,192
You finally got rid
of that highfalutin woman...

1095
01:24:07,367 --> 01:24:10,666
...with that smart-mouth little girl
and that sickly boy.

1096
01:24:11,704 --> 01:24:15,902
Yes, sir. lt`s New Year`s Eve,
and you are free at last.

1097
01:24:16,076 --> 01:24:18,010
Time to hit some clubs.

1098
01:24:18,511 --> 01:24:21,571
And they got some foxy ladies here.

1099
01:24:21,748 --> 01:24:24,239
Did you know Vancouver
produces more Playmates...

1100
01:24:24,417 --> 01:24:26,476
...than any other city in the world?

1101
01:24:26,653 --> 01:24:28,484
Let`s go, player.

1102
01:24:45,605 --> 01:24:48,335
Thanks, Dad, that was a lot of fun.

1103
01:25:22,642 --> 01:25:24,337
Hey, Nick.

1104
01:25:24,511 --> 01:25:26,911
You know what they call
a 50-year-old bachelor?

1105
01:25:27,413 --> 01:25:28,812
What?

1106
01:25:28,982 --> 01:25:30,643
Lonely.

1107
01:25:53,439 --> 01:25:55,304
Who is it?

1108
01:25:56,009 --> 01:25:57,237
Room service.

1109
01:25:59,412 --> 01:26:01,880
We didn`t order anything,
and that won`t change.

1110
01:26:02,248 --> 01:26:04,239
Let me explain, okay?

1111
01:26:04,417 --> 01:26:08,148
l know you`re upset,
and you have a right to be...

1112
01:26:08,321 --> 01:26:11,347
-...but there`s a good reason why all--
-Nick, they`re kids.

1113
01:26:11,524 --> 01:26:14,220
They don`t need reasons and excuses.
They need a man.

1114
01:26:14,527 --> 01:26:17,519
So whatever it is that you have to say,
just drop it.

1115
01:26:17,697 --> 01:26:20,928
l`ve been down this road before,
and l`m not going back.

1116
01:26:21,100 --> 01:26:23,261
-Good night.
-Wait, wait.

1117
01:26:25,805 --> 01:26:28,205
Just let me say goodbye to the kids.

1118
01:26:29,275 --> 01:26:30,936
l don`t think that`s a good idea.

1119
01:26:33,213 --> 01:26:34,578
Please.

1120
01:26:40,820 --> 01:26:42,287
Make it quick.

1121
01:26:43,957 --> 01:26:45,652
-Nick!
-Nick!

1122
01:26:45,825 --> 01:26:49,522
Hey, how you guys doing?
You all right?

1123
01:26:49,696 --> 01:26:52,961
l knew you`d come back.
Lindsey didn`t think so, but l did.

1124
01:26:53,132 --> 01:26:56,295
Boy, you know l`m gonna be
your friend always, right?

1125
01:26:56,469 --> 01:27:00,132
But Mama`s not gonna
date you anymore.

1126
01:27:00,607 --> 01:27:01,801
Listen, you guys.

1127
01:27:03,977 --> 01:27:05,945
Up here.

1128
01:27:08,514 --> 01:27:12,917
Your mother is a very,
very wonderful lady.

1129
01:27:13,886 --> 01:27:17,515
And she`s gonna be dating guys
that are much better than me.

1130
01:27:17,690 --> 01:27:21,592
So you guys gotta stop
chasing them off, okay?

1131
01:27:21,761 --> 01:27:23,922
And stay away from their cars.

1132
01:27:24,097 --> 01:27:25,928
Unless they`re bulletproof.

1133
01:27:29,202 --> 01:27:32,603
How do l know
we`ll ever see you again?

1134
01:27:34,240 --> 01:27:36,208
l got something for you.

1135
01:27:36,709 --> 01:27:41,646
l want you to hold on
to my man Satch, okay?

1136
01:27:42,015 --> 01:27:44,848
That`s until l see you again.

1137
01:27:46,085 --> 01:27:47,814
All right...

1138
01:27:47,987 --> 01:27:49,352
...l gotta get going.

1139
01:27:49,522 --> 01:27:52,150
Do you have to?

1140
01:27:52,325 --> 01:27:55,123
Yeah, little man, l think so.

1141
01:27:55,728 --> 01:27:58,720
Look, l got one more thing for you.

1142
01:28:03,102 --> 01:28:05,332
There you go.

1143
01:28:06,606 --> 01:28:08,733
And for you.

1144
01:28:09,509 --> 01:28:12,103
Now you have blingage.

1145
01:28:14,747 --> 01:28:16,977
l love you guys.

1146
01:28:22,355 --> 01:28:24,823
See you later, okay?

1147
01:28:24,991 --> 01:28:26,583
All right.

1148
01:28:31,931 --> 01:28:35,697
Suzanne, l`m sorry about
what happened today.

1149
01:28:35,868 --> 01:28:37,961
l really am.

1150
01:28:38,805 --> 01:28:41,171
l just wanna know if
we can still be friends.

1151
01:28:42,008 --> 01:28:44,340
Nick, l don`t think
that`s gonna happen.

1152
01:28:47,980 --> 01:28:50,005
Okay.

1153
01:28:51,984 --> 01:28:53,747
Nick?

1154
01:28:54,887 --> 01:28:57,048
We can`t be friends...

1155
01:28:58,391 --> 01:29:01,918
...because l wanna be so much more
than just your friend.

1156
01:29:02,795 --> 01:29:04,387
What?

1157
01:29:04,564 --> 01:29:06,464
Come here.

1158
01:29:06,632 --> 01:29:08,190
-Yes.
-Yes.

1159
01:29:09,969 --> 01:29:10,958
Hey.

1160
01:29:18,945 --> 01:29:21,379
lt`s New Year`s.
Aren`t you supposed to kiss her?

1161
01:29:29,655 --> 01:29:32,283
l love a happy ending.

1162
01:29:34,460 --> 01:29:35,927
Yeah!

1163
01:29:36,927 --> 01:29:46,927
