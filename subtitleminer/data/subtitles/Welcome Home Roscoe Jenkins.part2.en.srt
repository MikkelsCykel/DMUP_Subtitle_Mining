00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:05,973
You can leave a contact number
and, if there's anything...

2
00:00:06,747 --> 00:00:07,771
Of course.

3
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:10,415
Here you are.

4
00:00:33,741 --> 00:00:35,572
Eva, Eva, the baby!

5
00:00:44,852 --> 00:00:46,547
Goodbye, darkroom.

6
00:00:49,557 --> 00:00:50,615
I've read that kids

7
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:53,692
need their own space to feel

8
00:00:53,861 --> 00:00:55,123
independent.

9
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:57,319
What's that?

10
00:00:58,766 --> 00:00:59,858
A cloud.

11
00:01:03,571 --> 00:01:04,538
I don't know...

12
00:01:05,372 --> 00:01:07,306
I want the baby to feel
happy in the world.

13
00:01:08,409 --> 00:01:10,502
The world is awful
regardless of how many

14
00:01:10,678 --> 00:01:11,804
clouds you paint.

15
00:01:13,414 --> 00:01:14,608
I hate when you get

16
00:01:14,782 --> 00:01:15,749
negative...

17
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,055
You know grey
doesn't look bad on you?

18
00:01:23,657 --> 00:01:24,589
Let's see...

19
00:01:29,663 --> 00:01:30,755
That looks good.

20
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:54,918
Thanks to this great artist,
who hangs up his camera today,

21
00:01:55,656 --> 00:01:59,387
many of us understand better
the world we live in.

22
00:02:00,194 --> 00:02:01,593
With this plaque,

23
00:02:02,496 --> 00:02:04,054
we cannot give back...

24
00:02:04,398 --> 00:02:06,025
Aplaque and out to pasture.

25
00:02:06,734 --> 00:02:09,066
We all reach our end
and not everyone gets a plaque.

26
00:02:09,403 --> 00:02:11,837
And so you realize that
you've known how to earn

27
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,940
the love and respect of

28
00:02:15,109 --> 00:02:17,009
this great family...
- Abused to the end.

29
00:02:17,578 --> 00:02:19,136
He still had 3 months of contract.

30
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,176
The boss did right.
He's paying for his nursing home.

31
00:02:22,783 --> 00:02:24,444
Uh, I don't know...

32
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:26,983
what all this is for.

33
00:02:28,856 --> 00:02:32,189
I don't even know this man.

34
00:02:34,795 --> 00:02:36,592
I never had

35
00:02:36,764 --> 00:02:38,595
family or anything.

36
00:02:38,799 --> 00:02:41,165
- It's been many years...
- I want to say

37
00:02:41,502 --> 00:02:43,197
that life

38
00:02:43,637 --> 00:02:47,164
is a splendid failure.

39
00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:50,643
It's like a dog.

40
00:02:51,145 --> 00:02:52,806
First, it licks your shoes,

41
00:02:53,581 --> 00:02:55,811
then it bites your leg

42
00:02:57,084 --> 00:02:58,176
and devours you

43
00:03:00,521 --> 00:03:02,785
until there's nothing left of you.

44
00:03:04,491 --> 00:03:05,480
In the old days,

45
00:03:07,127 --> 00:03:09,687
I was like you,

46
00:03:10,831 --> 00:03:11,957
young...

47
00:03:13,634 --> 00:03:14,692
and now...

48
00:03:17,171 --> 00:03:19,799
Now I'm...

49
00:03:21,508 --> 00:03:22,736
an old man.

50
00:03:24,745 --> 00:03:26,212
I miss

51
00:03:27,948 --> 00:03:30,610
a woman's body,

52
00:03:32,186 --> 00:03:33,813
caressing

53
00:03:34,488 --> 00:03:36,479
her back,

54
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:40,185
kissing her breasts

55
00:03:40,728 --> 00:03:41,717
and feeling

56
00:03:41,895 --> 00:03:43,988
the hidden heat

57
00:03:44,164 --> 00:03:46,530
of her thighs.

58
00:04:28,409 --> 00:04:29,501
Are you okay?

59
00:04:31,779 --> 00:04:33,713
I wanted to show you
my dramatic range.

60
00:04:35,749 --> 00:04:36,807
There's no need.

61
00:04:43,624 --> 00:04:45,888
They say the secret
is in imagining the camera

62
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,891
is a man you want to seduce.

63
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,771
Am I better than 20 years ago?

64
00:05:15,622 --> 00:05:18,489
No, I can't... I can't.

65
00:05:18,726 --> 00:05:21,092
- You can't or don't want to?
- I can't.

66
00:05:22,096 --> 00:05:23,495
So you want to?

67
00:05:25,065 --> 00:05:25,997
No,

68
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,160
I can't want to.

69
00:05:38,746 --> 00:05:39,713
I'm sorry...

70
00:05:42,049 --> 00:05:43,209
How embarrassing.

71
00:05:44,718 --> 00:05:48,119
How can I do this
to an expectant father who's in love?

72
00:05:49,089 --> 00:05:51,216
I feel like such a shit.

73
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:57,588
I'm sorry...

74
00:06:04,605 --> 00:06:06,004
I'm really sorry.

75
00:06:20,654 --> 00:06:22,849
No, Samuel, no...

76
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:25,725
Are you sure?

77
00:07:16,577 --> 00:07:19,068
Of all my photos,
Eva likes this one the most.

78
00:07:22,082 --> 00:07:25,540
She says nothing's more lonely
than an abandoned instrument.

79
00:07:31,792 --> 00:07:34,090
Don't miss a shot. He'll have fun
explaining this to his wife.

80
00:07:34,628 --> 00:07:36,562
Angle it when he gets near,

81
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:37,924
like he's kissing her.

82
00:07:38,999 --> 00:07:40,057
She saw us...

83
00:07:40,801 --> 00:07:43,861
- She knows we're here...
- Of course, she knows.

84
00:07:44,538 --> 00:07:45,766
She called us...

85
00:07:46,807 --> 00:07:48,069
He's gonna squirm

86
00:07:49,476 --> 00:07:50,943
over this one.

87
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:53,605
What're you doing?

88
00:07:54,047 --> 00:07:55,776
- I won't do it.
- What...?

89
00:07:56,283 --> 00:07:57,648
No way, Amadeo.

90
00:07:57,818 --> 00:08:00,252
Hey, bury the school-kid scruples.
This is important.

91
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,888
Hand me the camera, give me...!

92
00:08:03,056 --> 00:08:05,524
- Hey, piss off...
- Damn it, give it to me!

93
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:07,950
Get off, let me go!

94
00:08:11,932 --> 00:08:12,921
Kid,

95
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:14,565
fucking kid...

96
00:08:15,102 --> 00:08:17,468
Amadeo is one of
our great writers.

97
00:08:17,938 --> 00:08:20,236
He's won it all in journalism.

98
00:08:20,941 --> 00:08:22,909
He even won
the Gold & Diamond Pen...

99
00:08:24,845 --> 00:08:26,676
He can stick that pen
where it hurts.

100
00:08:29,049 --> 00:08:30,482
I'm gonna be a Dad soon,

101
00:08:31,852 --> 00:08:34,582
and I feel like my kid
is already watching me,

102
00:08:35,656 --> 00:08:38,056
studying who I am.

103
00:08:38,592 --> 00:08:40,526
I don't want
to disappoint him yet.

104
00:08:41,028 --> 00:08:42,256
You're gonna be a Dad?

105
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,929
Why didn't anyone tell me?

106
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,800
Give me a hug...

107
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:13,259
You still don't want
to know the baby's sex?

108
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:16,324
- We prefer the surprise.
- Okay, fine,

109
00:09:16,663 --> 00:09:17,994
like in the old days.

110
00:09:18,131 --> 00:09:19,393
- Come in...
- Sorry...

111
00:09:21,034 --> 00:09:22,695
I think you should take

112
00:09:22,869 --> 00:09:25,838
childbirth classes too, Samuel.

113
00:09:26,206 --> 00:09:27,639
You'll cut the umbilical cord.

114
00:09:27,841 --> 00:09:29,866
Me? I stink at manual labor.

115
00:09:30,077 --> 00:09:31,669
Really? Sorry, no excuses.

116
00:09:32,012 --> 00:09:34,776
Ababy's birth is like...
his first birthday,

117
00:09:34,948 --> 00:09:36,973
a welcome home party.
Cameras...

118
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:40,017
joy, visits from parents,
friends, whoever.

119
00:09:42,556 --> 00:09:44,046
Look, kids... it's here.

120
00:09:52,165 --> 00:09:53,427
Russky Standard,

121
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,589
for all.

122
00:09:54,768 --> 00:09:57,168
- Lucas pays.
- My birthday, I pay. Take note.

123
00:09:58,171 --> 00:09:59,832
You'd forgotten.

124
00:10:00,007 --> 00:10:01,634
Guys, the presents...

125
00:10:02,075 --> 00:10:03,474
Lucas, each of us

126
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:06,044
has bought a gift
to broaden your horizons.

127
00:10:06,213 --> 00:10:08,181
Our expectations are not very high.

128
00:10:08,515 --> 00:10:09,948
You've never read a book

129
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,879
in yourfucking life?
- Always been

130
00:10:12,052 --> 00:10:14,247
too busy...
- I bought you an essay

131
00:10:14,588 --> 00:10:16,852
on Third World exploitation.
Lots of photos...

132
00:10:17,057 --> 00:10:19,218
- You'll like it.
- These are

133
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:21,686
adventure books in big print

134
00:10:21,862 --> 00:10:23,557
so you catch the reading bug

135
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,322
a lot faster.

136
00:10:25,866 --> 00:10:28,334
Mine's in Braille,
in book shops everywhere.

137
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:31,763
Are you fucking crazy?
Paco,

138
00:10:31,972 --> 00:10:32,904
another round.

139
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,507
I told you...

140
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:35,733
Lucas, you scare us.

141
00:10:35,909 --> 00:10:38,469
You're empty inside...
you're a functional illiterate.

142
00:10:38,645 --> 00:10:39,942
We're friends,

143
00:10:40,981 --> 00:10:42,471
we can't allow it.

144
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:43,775
You're joking, right?

145
00:10:43,984 --> 00:10:44,951
What do you want?

146
00:10:45,118 --> 00:10:49,054
For me to start reading now
and trash who I am?

147
00:10:51,124 --> 00:10:52,523
She's here...!

148
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,599
- How're you?
- Fine.

149
00:11:05,972 --> 00:11:07,371
Guys, this is

150
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:10,806
Katrina. Katrina, this bunch
of losers are my friends.

151
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:13,771
Here... I suppose you all know her?

152
00:11:14,448 --> 00:11:15,380
Hi.

153
00:11:16,483 --> 00:11:17,507
Gold medal

154
00:11:17,684 --> 00:11:19,049
in karate.
- Silver.

155
00:11:19,586 --> 00:11:20,678
The gold went

156
00:11:20,854 --> 00:11:23,516
to a Taiwanese bitch.
- Bitch.

157
00:11:24,191 --> 00:11:27,024
C'mon, take away that shit.
We have a lot to celebrate.

158
00:12:26,286 --> 00:12:27,776
This is Ana

159
00:12:29,089 --> 00:12:30,613
and that's Irina.

160
00:12:30,991 --> 00:12:31,980
Charmed.

161
00:12:33,126 --> 00:12:35,185
She was gonna cook
Russian today. Remember?

162
00:12:36,229 --> 00:12:37,958
Uh-huh.

163
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,826
Between you and me,

164
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:45,931
a woman who spends
the whole day blowing a tuba

165
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:48,741
is not frightened much

166
00:12:48,909 --> 00:12:50,274
by the sight of a naked man.

167
00:12:50,744 --> 00:12:53,269
We want to form
a chamber music ensemble,

168
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,871
to do something other
than the orchestra.

169
00:12:57,117 --> 00:12:59,483
I don't want to stagnate
my entire life there.

170
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,747
But I suppose you could care less.

171
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:05,750
Why do you say that?

172
00:13:06,193 --> 00:13:08,058
Cos you don't care what I do.

173
00:13:09,863 --> 00:13:12,923
You don't want to talk to me
or hearwhat I have to say.

174
00:13:14,234 --> 00:13:18,193
Your motherwants to talk...
even though it's four

175
00:13:18,538 --> 00:13:19,596
in the morning...

176
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:23,576
I don't know if you realize
what's happening to us.

177
00:13:26,813 --> 00:13:28,576
I know because I want a baby.

178
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:33,080
For me it's a way to avenge
my parents' death.

179
00:13:36,089 --> 00:13:38,922
Away of feeling
that life goes on

180
00:13:40,927 --> 00:13:42,758
and continues no matterwhat.

181
00:13:43,129 --> 00:13:45,654
But maybe you don't feel that way.

182
00:13:46,299 --> 00:13:48,324
It's probably very confusing,

183
00:13:49,603 --> 00:13:52,037
something out of the blue
that you didn't expect.

184
00:14:08,622 --> 00:14:12,854
Eva? I was just organizing
a dinnerfor everybody to meet.

185
00:14:14,127 --> 00:14:15,151
You're not Eva?

186
00:14:16,263 --> 00:14:17,287
Sandra?

187
00:14:17,964 --> 00:14:18,931
Nieves?

188
00:14:19,132 --> 00:14:20,463
Anyone else?

189
00:14:20,834 --> 00:14:23,564
I'm not on the list of women
who matter in your life.

190
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:24,704
Mom...

191
00:14:25,572 --> 00:14:28,336
So this is the dump
where you work.

192
00:14:28,675 --> 00:14:31,667
- Why are you here?
- With the new road, it's a snap.

193
00:14:31,845 --> 00:14:33,073
You don't say.

194
00:14:33,413 --> 00:14:35,347
Introduce me to your pals.

195
00:14:36,116 --> 00:14:38,107
I'm Sami's mother,

196
00:14:39,119 --> 00:14:41,485
how are you?
Is he a good boy?

197
00:14:42,422 --> 00:14:44,788
Does it always smell so bad in here?

198
00:14:45,558 --> 00:14:47,048
You really do sweat the news...

199
00:14:47,394 --> 00:14:48,656
Mom, please...

200
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:53,355
- Is this your boss?
- Yes...

201
00:14:55,602 --> 00:14:57,001
It was so many years ago...

202
00:15:02,909 --> 00:15:05,469
You look so old, Andres.

203
00:15:07,981 --> 00:15:10,575
- Time overlooks no one.
- In turn, you look great.

204
00:15:11,084 --> 00:15:12,346
Hogwash...

205
00:15:12,619 --> 00:15:14,553
Soon I'll be a grandma.
Can you believe it?

206
00:15:14,721 --> 00:15:17,155
- I've got 5 grandkids.
- Don't compare.

207
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:20,653
You were always horribly
boring and conventional.

208
00:15:20,827 --> 00:15:23,591
Not always, not always...

209
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:28,663
True, you had five minutes when
you thought you'd change the world.

210
00:15:28,935 --> 00:15:30,926
Just before it changed you.

211
00:15:31,204 --> 00:15:34,105
Sooner or later,
it changes us all.

212
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:35,834
Come up, please.

213
00:15:36,643 --> 00:15:38,907
Didn't want to disturb.
I only wanted to see Sami...

214
00:15:39,079 --> 00:15:40,068
You don't disturb.

215
00:15:41,214 --> 00:15:43,546
It's like entering a time tunnel.

216
00:15:43,717 --> 00:15:47,153
It's so clear now...
With a mother like that...

217
00:15:47,487 --> 00:15:48,977
- Your kids?
- Yes.

218
00:15:49,789 --> 00:15:51,882
Boy, they're ugly.

219
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:54,092
This woman's seduced many.

220
00:15:54,627 --> 00:15:56,959
We should be separated
from parents at birth.

221
00:15:57,831 --> 00:16:00,629
The family is the most reactionary
institution on the planet.

222
00:16:01,034 --> 00:16:02,865
She seems really nice.

223
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:05,930
What's yourfather like?

224
00:16:06,506 --> 00:16:07,632
I don't know...

225
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:09,741
He managed to escape
before I was bom.

226
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:12,675
Apraying mantis...

227
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,945
They devourwhat they love.

228
00:16:16,049 --> 00:16:17,880
For his first steps.

229
00:16:18,985 --> 00:16:22,887
It's pink because I was convinced
that the baby would be a girl.

230
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:26,755
Poor Samuel had to dress
in girl's clothes for two years.

231
00:16:27,227 --> 00:16:29,058
Then the pediatrician said

232
00:16:29,229 --> 00:16:31,697
it could traumatize him for life.
You had to see...

233
00:16:32,732 --> 00:16:34,097
how darling he looked

234
00:16:34,467 --> 00:16:37,595
in this cute little skirt.

235
00:16:37,771 --> 00:16:39,204
I can imagine...

236
00:16:41,074 --> 00:16:42,632
Are all the things I brought okay?

237
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:46,843
Perfect, because we haven't
had time to buy a thing.

238
00:16:47,013 --> 00:16:50,141
Good, because now it's a make-
a-dollar-off-the-babies' world.

239
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:51,847
We've lost the passion

240
00:16:52,018 --> 00:16:53,610
of knitting for our kids.

241
00:16:54,287 --> 00:16:57,654
Do you know psychiatrists
recommend macrame to combat

242
00:16:57,824 --> 00:16:59,689
stress?
- Really?

243
00:17:00,126 --> 00:17:02,651
Samuel, perhaps macrame
would do you well.

244
00:17:03,797 --> 00:17:04,764
No.

245
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:06,991
Samuel's problem

246
00:17:07,167 --> 00:17:08,828
is the same as all men

247
00:17:09,002 --> 00:17:10,469
when they have to face

248
00:17:10,637 --> 00:17:11,899
responsibility.

249
00:17:12,205 --> 00:17:13,797
They only know one response:

250
00:17:14,941 --> 00:17:15,930
To run...

251
00:17:34,561 --> 00:17:37,029
Sorry I'm late,
I had to pick up Gladys.

252
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:39,725
She's Don Vicente's niece.

253
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:41,889
Hello.

254
00:17:42,068 --> 00:17:43,035
Hi.

255
00:17:50,076 --> 00:17:51,668
Still taking pictures...

256
00:17:52,045 --> 00:17:55,572
Yeah, I shoot anything.

257
00:17:56,049 --> 00:17:57,516
But I kid myself,

258
00:17:58,284 --> 00:17:59,683
I think

259
00:18:00,153 --> 00:18:02,644
I can make time stop.

260
00:18:02,822 --> 00:18:05,757
Everyone says hi.
How's it going?

261
00:18:06,192 --> 00:18:08,854
Bad, very bad. The food

262
00:18:09,162 --> 00:18:10,652
sucks

263
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:12,325
and the Masses

264
00:18:13,099 --> 00:18:14,794
never end...

265
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:16,128
He had family in South America?

266
00:18:16,302 --> 00:18:17,599
Distant...

267
00:18:18,304 --> 00:18:19,896
Very distant...

268
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:22,267
Distant...

269
00:18:22,942 --> 00:18:26,036
So you're Camilo's daughter?

270
00:18:27,313 --> 00:18:29,543
But Camilo never had kids.

271
00:18:29,749 --> 00:18:32,684
Aprostitute?
Are you crazy?

272
00:18:32,952 --> 00:18:34,715
- What's wrong?
- He's an old man...

273
00:18:34,888 --> 00:18:37,584
Wouldn't you like someone
to do this for you?

274
00:18:38,091 --> 00:18:41,720
He's going mad thinking he's getting
a blow job from the niece

275
00:18:41,895 --> 00:18:43,192
of someone he doesn't remember.

276
00:18:43,363 --> 00:18:44,591
- Hello.
- Hi.

277
00:18:44,764 --> 00:18:48,700
- Has Vicente calmed down?
- Yeah, he's with his niece now.

278
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:51,034
I'll go in to meet her.

279
00:18:51,204 --> 00:18:55,573
No, leave them. They have a lot
of personal stuff to catch up on.

280
00:18:55,742 --> 00:18:57,733
Imagine... See you later.

281
00:19:28,641 --> 00:19:30,108
Move, I can't see herface.

282
00:19:50,964 --> 00:19:52,295
Here's more bread.

283
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:54,928
Want some more wine?

284
00:19:55,401 --> 00:19:56,425
Samuel,

285
00:19:56,603 --> 00:19:59,538
believe me, you have
a talent for cooking.

286
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:00,965
His mother taught him.

287
00:20:01,207 --> 00:20:02,435
Don't know why I thought

288
00:20:02,609 --> 00:20:05,407
you'd be the typically
perfect cook.

289
00:20:05,578 --> 00:20:08,911
I haven't a clue
cos I'm not perfect.

290
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:10,413
Yes, she is.

291
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:13,143
- You play with the Real orchestra?
- The viola.

292
00:20:13,486 --> 00:20:15,750
Its resonance is so unique.

293
00:20:15,922 --> 00:20:17,617
Especially out of tune.

294
00:20:18,691 --> 00:20:20,886
Isn't it sad reducing
something so pretty

295
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,186
to office work?

296
00:20:22,929 --> 00:20:25,693
I saw an opera with a chick once.
Fell asleep 3 times.

297
00:20:26,566 --> 00:20:27,555
No way that

298
00:20:27,734 --> 00:20:30,032
thing would end.
And all that yodeling.

299
00:20:30,703 --> 00:20:31,795
What an ass!

300
00:20:32,138 --> 00:20:35,539
Is it true that opera
singers end up nuts

301
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:37,801
because of excess oxygen
in the brain?

302
00:20:38,811 --> 00:20:41,974
With world hunger and
the Iberian lynx in danger

303
00:20:42,148 --> 00:20:43,547
of extinction and four

304
00:20:43,716 --> 00:20:45,809
assholes wearing furs and jewels

305
00:20:45,985 --> 00:20:47,850
listening to warbling.
- Ignore him...

306
00:20:48,021 --> 00:20:50,683
He'd fill up the Prado Museum
with stickers of Che.

307
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:52,657
Hey, Che is an old icon

308
00:20:52,825 --> 00:20:54,452
like a revolutionary

309
00:20:54,627 --> 00:20:55,889
Mickey Mouse.

310
00:20:58,631 --> 00:21:00,189
Hoows the pregnancy?

311
00:21:01,701 --> 00:21:02,759
Pregnant women

312
00:21:02,935 --> 00:21:03,924
turn me on.

313
00:21:04,203 --> 00:21:05,227
To fuck, I mean...

314
00:21:05,972 --> 00:21:07,667
A drain pipe turns him on.

315
00:21:07,907 --> 00:21:09,670
You seem very set up, Samuel.

316
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:14,011
The middle-class home...
I suppose the SUV is on the way.

317
00:21:14,681 --> 00:21:15,739
And you can hire

318
00:21:15,915 --> 00:21:18,213
a slave to babysit
while you watch TV at night.

319
00:21:18,918 --> 00:21:20,078
Not a bad idea...

320
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,444
Aflat, living together,

321
00:21:22,622 --> 00:21:23,554
a kid.

322
00:21:24,657 --> 00:21:26,750
Piles of sand that you dump
on each other, huh?

323
00:21:26,926 --> 00:21:28,621
Well, I feel the same or better...

324
00:21:29,495 --> 00:21:31,019
Ignore themmm.

325
00:21:31,197 --> 00:21:34,257
They're like that. They made a mess
of things for me and Maarisa...

326
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,227
when we went for our mortgage.

327
00:21:38,037 --> 00:21:39,061
See, now

328
00:21:39,238 --> 00:21:41,934
we only have... 27 years left.

329
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:45,576
This wine's super...

330
00:21:46,012 --> 00:21:48,537
I favor suicide
to procreation.

331
00:21:49,816 --> 00:21:51,545
When I see a kid, I think:

332
00:21:51,718 --> 00:21:53,208
"Before you enter, let me out".

333
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:55,518
She's so strange...

334
00:21:56,122 --> 00:21:57,885
I admit I dislike normal types.

335
00:21:58,057 --> 00:21:59,922
Normal types are depressing.

336
00:22:00,126 --> 00:22:02,151
And Samuel... who looked

337
00:22:02,328 --> 00:22:04,296
so special that first day.

338
00:22:05,031 --> 00:22:06,555
Life is a hammer.

339
00:22:06,866 --> 00:22:08,197
Stick out a bit and bam...

340
00:22:08,935 --> 00:22:10,129
you're back in again.

341
00:22:13,973 --> 00:22:14,962
He's right

342
00:22:15,608 --> 00:22:16,802
about that.

343
00:22:17,243 --> 00:22:18,904
Come on, Eva wants to meet you

344
00:22:19,078 --> 00:22:21,273
not discover
what bastards you can be.

345
00:22:21,881 --> 00:22:24,281
Hey, show some respect.
Does the truth bother you?

346
00:22:24,617 --> 00:22:25,982
It's your truth...

347
00:22:27,186 --> 00:22:29,450
What a line.
Sharp like a knife.

348
00:22:30,089 --> 00:22:31,056
Let's see.

349
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:32,521
I've got to pee.

350
00:22:34,761 --> 00:22:36,626
I had 6 beers too many
before coming here.

351
00:22:36,996 --> 00:22:39,021
I'll go, to ease the tension some.

352
00:22:39,899 --> 00:22:41,059
I'll go too... So much

353
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:42,963
IKEAjoy makes me sick.

354
00:22:44,937 --> 00:22:46,131
It was greeat, huh?

355
00:22:46,472 --> 00:22:48,064
Maarisa hates them too.

356
00:22:49,475 --> 00:22:51,500
The last time they were over,

357
00:22:52,044 --> 00:22:54,808
Contra decided
to break a coffee set.

358
00:22:56,015 --> 00:22:57,505
Too middle class, he said.

359
00:22:58,518 --> 00:23:01,817
Even though we bought it in
a Mayan arts and crafts shop.

360
00:23:03,489 --> 00:23:04,547
They never grow up...

361
00:23:05,057 --> 00:23:08,117
Maybe they don't care to.
Do you want to, Samuel?

362
00:23:15,601 --> 00:23:16,659
Yes, Maarisa...

363
00:23:17,069 --> 00:23:19,162
Yeah, yeah...
- Let me check on them.

364
00:23:20,173 --> 00:23:21,572
Finiiished... yes,

365
00:23:21,741 --> 00:23:24,141
yes, yes. 36.4?

366
00:23:25,711 --> 00:23:26,973
Since when is that a fever?

367
00:23:27,146 --> 00:23:28,113
Take it easy.

368
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:29,748
He's yours.

369
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,240
You check with the electronic one?

370
00:23:32,919 --> 00:23:35,979
Try the titaaanium.

371
00:23:36,556 --> 00:23:38,683
Yeah, yeah, don't worry.

372
00:23:41,794 --> 00:23:43,523
Asshole, what are you doing?

373
00:23:43,863 --> 00:23:45,490
- Peeing in the bowl.
- This is the bed.

374
00:23:45,665 --> 00:23:49,192
- Bastards...
- You guys think you're funny.

375
00:23:49,702 --> 00:23:52,694
- I had nothing to do with it.
- Don't get mad.

376
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,905
If you were us, you'd be

377
00:23:56,075 --> 00:23:58,009
cracking up
at a jerk who invites

378
00:23:58,344 --> 00:24:01,609
you to his house for dinner
to meet his pregnant girlfriend.

379
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:03,743
Hey, watch it.
The dinner was great.

380
00:24:04,083 --> 00:24:05,983
It just riles you
having to play the role

381
00:24:06,152 --> 00:24:09,883
of the responsible one.
Wouldn't you like to trade places?

382
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,856
Believe me a loony cretin
is not my goal in life.

383
00:24:13,025 --> 00:24:14,515
Acting like I was 3 years old.

384
00:24:14,927 --> 00:24:17,418
I prefer a boring life
than spending a second with you.

385
00:24:18,531 --> 00:24:20,294
Don't say that, we're buddies.

386
00:24:20,466 --> 00:24:22,366
Stick yourfriendship,
I don't want it.

387
00:24:22,535 --> 00:24:26,301
Friendship is above
all argument. Understand?

388
00:24:26,806 --> 00:24:28,569
Hey, give each other a hug.

389
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:30,832
Yeah, I'll take care of this.

390
00:24:33,913 --> 00:24:35,813
Maarisa, I'll call you later.

391
00:24:57,537 --> 00:24:58,504
Eva,

392
00:25:00,273 --> 00:25:01,570
I can't find my clothes.

393
00:25:03,809 --> 00:25:06,277
There's something
I'm not sure if I've told you.

394
00:25:08,447 --> 00:25:10,381
It's a mental image
of my parents...

395
00:25:11,817 --> 00:25:12,909
I was

396
00:25:13,085 --> 00:25:14,677
twelve or thirteen.

397
00:25:16,622 --> 00:25:19,489
My Dad would spend a whole day
fixing a car in the back.

398
00:25:20,593 --> 00:25:22,754
It was an old car,
his father's...

399
00:25:23,763 --> 00:25:25,253
Sometimes I'd help him

400
00:25:25,631 --> 00:25:29,897
I'd spend hours with him, listening
to him whistle under the car...

401
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:34,736
One day my mother came out like
always, to say dinner was ready.

402
00:25:35,074 --> 00:25:37,508
She got near
and bent down by his side.

403
00:25:37,977 --> 00:25:39,274
I recall her asking:

404
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,372
Do you want meat leftovers
from lunch or croquettes?

405
00:25:44,784 --> 00:25:45,978
And my Dad replied...

406
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:47,684
Whatever pisses you off more.

407
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:51,021
But the way my mother
grabbed his thigh,

408
00:25:51,557 --> 00:25:54,549
the content of
that meaningless exchange.

409
00:25:54,961 --> 00:25:56,895
That moment for me expressed

410
00:25:57,063 --> 00:25:58,621
all they were as a couple.

411
00:26:00,733 --> 00:26:02,860
But that caress as she got up

412
00:26:05,871 --> 00:26:07,065
was magical...

413
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:11,842
It also was a gesture of love,

414
00:26:16,782 --> 00:26:17,806
I don't know.

415
00:26:18,684 --> 00:26:19,946
I've thought a lot tonight

416
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:21,086
about that.

417
00:26:22,555 --> 00:26:25,080
About how nice it was...
But you had to be

418
00:26:25,424 --> 00:26:27,517
them to know
what they were feeling.

419
00:26:30,096 --> 00:26:32,121
Because it's also sad...

420
00:26:34,166 --> 00:26:35,724
and you don't want that.

421
00:26:37,436 --> 00:26:38,460
Eva...

422
00:26:38,871 --> 00:26:41,999
You won't find your clothes.
I've packed your bags.

423
00:26:45,911 --> 00:26:49,438
There's yourfreedom.
I want you to have it back.

424
00:26:50,983 --> 00:26:52,416
But that's crazy, Eva...

425
00:26:52,718 --> 00:26:55,551
I can't fix cars
and you can't make croquettes.

426
00:27:00,526 --> 00:27:01,788
It won't work,

427
00:27:03,729 --> 00:27:05,094
you can't stand this...

428
00:27:07,099 --> 00:27:09,158
We're not a snapshot
of our best moment...

429
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:13,662
That's why I don't want
to ruin things

430
00:27:15,741 --> 00:27:17,436
or end up hating each other.

431
00:27:25,017 --> 00:27:26,848
The money is clear in this one.

432
00:27:28,154 --> 00:27:30,384
- How much did you pay?
- 3000 euros...

433
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:32,018
5000 more, upon delivery.

434
00:27:32,825 --> 00:27:34,019
- Horrible...
- Yep.

435
00:27:34,193 --> 00:27:36,093
If it doesn't work out,
Andres will kill me.

436
00:27:36,862 --> 00:27:38,625
It all depends on one call.

437
00:27:39,031 --> 00:27:42,000
I'm talking about
one kid's life. 8000 euros...

438
00:27:46,772 --> 00:27:48,000
Fuck!

439
00:27:48,407 --> 00:27:52,002
Shit, I told you not
to leave things in the way.

440
00:27:52,511 --> 00:27:55,537
- Goddamn, bloody hell!
- They're Samuel's bags.

441
00:27:57,383 --> 00:28:00,875
- His girl kicked him out.
- Shit, I didn't know.

442
00:28:01,053 --> 00:28:02,452
Sorry.

443
00:28:02,922 --> 00:28:03,946
Get away...

444
00:28:04,123 --> 00:28:06,353
Inviting you to my house
would be worse.

445
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:09,960
I'll be staying at Mariano's.

446
00:28:12,398 --> 00:28:13,660
That should be fun.

447
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:17,464
Finish your dinner, Pablo...

448
00:28:17,603 --> 00:28:21,835
You filled up on sweets.
You know that I rest

449
00:28:22,007 --> 00:28:24,840
when they nap.
- It's better to have kids early.

450
00:28:25,478 --> 00:28:26,467
Like us.

451
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,608
When Silvio's 20, I'll be

452
00:28:29,782 --> 00:28:32,945
only 57.
In the prime of my youth

453
00:28:33,953 --> 00:28:36,421
to do whatever
I please, my things.

454
00:28:36,689 --> 00:28:37,713
My music...

455
00:28:39,625 --> 00:28:41,058
Sure you don't want to go to

456
00:28:41,393 --> 00:28:42,758
the movies or...?
- Movies?

457
00:28:43,629 --> 00:28:44,789
Last time I went, Jorge Sanz

458
00:28:44,964 --> 00:28:46,625
was still a kid.

459
00:28:47,032 --> 00:28:49,728
We can't. The kids get up
eight times a night.

460
00:28:50,369 --> 00:28:53,133
Yeah, Pablito has a cough

461
00:28:53,472 --> 00:28:55,872
and Silvio gets up at midnight

462
00:28:56,142 --> 00:28:58,042
and falls asleep nightwalking

463
00:28:58,377 --> 00:28:59,867
down the hallway.
- Oh...

464
00:29:00,579 --> 00:29:01,739
Come on, Silvio...

465
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:05,447
It's okaay.

466
00:29:06,051 --> 00:29:07,382
No problem.

467
00:29:07,553 --> 00:29:09,851
It's alright.
He induces the vomiting

468
00:29:10,022 --> 00:29:12,923
to get attention.

469
00:29:13,459 --> 00:29:15,654
The pediatrician said

470
00:29:15,828 --> 00:29:17,523
not to pay him any mind.

471
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:20,062
Don't make it a big deal.
It's not important.

472
00:29:20,432 --> 00:29:22,093
Let him see we're unaffected.

473
00:29:22,601 --> 00:29:24,569
See, Silvio, not affected.

474
00:29:25,037 --> 00:29:26,436
Mariano, we're not affected.

475
00:29:26,605 --> 00:29:30,666
We're not affected.
Saaamuel, tell him.

476
00:29:31,143 --> 00:29:33,737
He won't get anyone's attention
that way, will he?

477
00:29:33,913 --> 00:29:35,141
Right?

478
00:29:36,982 --> 00:29:38,074
No, no...

479
00:29:40,786 --> 00:29:43,050
I only think of you...

480
00:29:43,989 --> 00:29:46,150
holding hands,

481
00:29:46,692 --> 00:29:47,989
walking through

482
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,991
a garden...

483
00:29:52,064 --> 00:29:53,725
There can't be anyone

484
00:29:53,899 --> 00:29:54,923
in this world...

485
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,567
Spare us

486
00:29:56,735 --> 00:29:58,532
or they won't fall asleep.

487
00:30:01,774 --> 00:30:04,140
I only think of you...

488
00:30:09,915 --> 00:30:10,847
What?

489
00:30:11,784 --> 00:30:13,183
Gets you jealous, huh?

490
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:18,517
Painless delivery
requires your cooperation.

491
00:30:19,124 --> 00:30:21,615
If you breathe properly
and stay calm,

492
00:30:21,794 --> 00:30:24,456
having your son will be like
eating an ice cream.

493
00:30:24,763 --> 00:30:25,752
Come in.

494
00:30:25,931 --> 00:30:28,058
I hope you're earlier
on delivery day.

495
00:30:28,234 --> 00:30:29,496
No, no...

496
00:30:32,671 --> 00:30:33,729
Why are you here?

497
00:30:33,906 --> 00:30:36,807
I must be at the delivery to help.

498
00:30:36,976 --> 00:30:38,102
You don't look good.

499
00:30:39,044 --> 00:30:40,568
Did you go out last night?

500
00:30:41,547 --> 00:30:43,242
I went to the disco
with some friends.

501
00:30:44,283 --> 00:30:46,683
I felt like moving
to that terrible

502
00:30:46,852 --> 00:30:48,717
music.
- Are you nuts?

503
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:51,789
And the baby, you want him
to grow up to be a deejay?

504
00:30:51,957 --> 00:30:54,118
Samuel, concentrate.
You have all day

505
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:55,654
to chat at home.

506
00:30:56,795 --> 00:30:58,092
Resume position.

507
00:30:58,597 --> 00:31:00,087
- Eva?
- Yeah...

508
00:31:03,569 --> 00:31:04,866
And breathe.

509
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:17,109
We've got to raise hell, chaos.

510
00:31:17,616 --> 00:31:19,880
Give those bastards an earful.

511
00:31:20,486 --> 00:31:22,113
Protesters are coming from afar.

512
00:31:22,454 --> 00:31:24,786
Are you crazy?
You'll kill someone.

513
00:31:25,824 --> 00:31:29,419
We can't let these
International Monetary Fund types

514
00:31:29,595 --> 00:31:33,122
govern mankind's destiny
with their market investments.

515
00:31:33,465 --> 00:31:34,932
You're really absurd.

516
00:31:36,068 --> 00:31:38,434
You're a radical
disguised as a joumalist.

517
00:31:39,838 --> 00:31:42,602
At school, everyone wanted
to go corporate or be a broker.

518
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:46,142
Not me, I wanted
to change the world.

519
00:31:47,746 --> 00:31:50,681
- How, throwing molotovs?
- According to you,

520
00:31:50,849 --> 00:31:53,682
the world improves by crying
on a sofa because a girl left you.

521
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,919
Stop looking at yourself.

522
00:31:56,088 --> 00:31:58,579
Look around you
at the poverty, inequality

523
00:31:59,191 --> 00:32:00,852
and transgenics.

524
00:32:01,694 --> 00:32:03,628
Why do you have Eva's photo?

525
00:32:04,163 --> 00:32:05,562
No wonder I couldn't find it.

526
00:32:05,731 --> 00:32:07,961
Hey, don't touch my stuff...

527
00:32:08,467 --> 00:32:09,593
Geez, help me...

528
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:15,597
I'm telling you: you're weird.

529
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:22,547
Hey, don't think,

530
00:32:23,082 --> 00:32:24,140
I mean...

531
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:29,148
sure I jerked off,
but I did so respectfully.

532
00:32:36,929 --> 00:32:38,226
I left my job.

533
00:32:40,032 --> 00:32:42,899
I'm tired of starting
relationships at the end.

534
00:32:44,269 --> 00:32:47,830
First, they see you naked.
Then you can't show them the inner you.

535
00:32:48,741 --> 00:32:50,208
They just want the outer package...

536
00:32:50,542 --> 00:32:53,568
Tell me after I meet
with my boss a second, okay?

537
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:10,488
Samuel, I need a moment
to tell you something.

538
00:33:10,662 --> 00:33:12,653
It's been with me for days now.

539
00:33:12,998 --> 00:33:15,558
I know we're not
great buddies but

540
00:33:15,734 --> 00:33:19,636
I want you to know I feel bad
about what's happening.

541
00:33:19,905 --> 00:33:21,805
I've envied you a long time.

542
00:33:21,974 --> 00:33:23,839
You have your girl,

543
00:33:24,009 --> 00:33:26,375
you don't return home
alone every night.

544
00:33:27,112 --> 00:33:29,012
That's worth fighting for.

545
00:33:30,082 --> 00:33:33,518
I'd never say this
in front of the others.

546
00:33:34,386 --> 00:33:37,014
But I know what darkness is.

547
00:33:37,189 --> 00:33:38,679
I live it daily.

548
00:33:38,957 --> 00:33:41,926
But there's something worse
than jerking off all your life

549
00:33:42,094 --> 00:33:44,062
to embossed porn magazines

550
00:33:44,963 --> 00:33:49,559
or the painful memories
that eat away at your soul.

551
00:33:51,437 --> 00:33:54,497
The worse thing is to never
feel a woman's skin

552
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:59,139
and to wake up every morning
completely alone.

553
00:34:00,879 --> 00:34:04,542
You feel so useless not being
able to help someone

554
00:34:05,584 --> 00:34:08,917
that you begin searching shadows
for anyone to share life with.

555
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:12,750
Well, Samuel,

556
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:16,722
I continue waiting mornings
for those soft, delicate whispers

557
00:34:16,895 --> 00:34:19,864
in my ear, describing
that tree at the end

558
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:22,000
of the street or a sunset

559
00:34:24,736 --> 00:34:27,796
or a raindrop running
down a glass pane...

560
00:34:29,975 --> 00:34:34,776
orwho'll go to the movies and tell me
if it's a closeup orwide shot.

561
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:37,848
Who knows with today's directors?

562
00:34:39,551 --> 00:34:40,540
Fucking is important too,

563
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:41,651
but...

564
00:34:43,088 --> 00:34:45,056
feeling someone embracing

565
00:34:46,658 --> 00:34:47,784
and protecting you.

566
00:34:56,368 --> 00:34:59,599
Samuel, don't misunderstand...

567
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:02,329
My name is Nieves.

568
00:35:03,475 --> 00:35:04,942
I am...

569
00:35:06,645 --> 00:35:07,907
Don't tell me...

570
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:20,317
How are things with Eva?

571
00:35:21,593 --> 00:35:22,685
Tonight you sleep over.

572
00:35:23,495 --> 00:35:24,792
Okay, right.

573
00:35:24,963 --> 00:35:27,363
One thing always works with women.

574
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,331
Let them see you cry.

575
00:35:30,102 --> 00:35:32,536
One tear and they forgive all.

576
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:34,870
I have a way, if tears fail you:

577
00:35:36,441 --> 00:35:37,567
I squeeze a ball,

578
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:40,801
like that, hard.

579
00:35:44,883 --> 00:35:46,077
Pinch it...

580
00:35:49,421 --> 00:35:50,820
and watch the tears roll.

581
00:35:51,823 --> 00:35:52,790
Uh, right.

582
00:35:53,492 --> 00:35:55,824
Show them we can be sensitive.

583
00:35:56,929 --> 00:35:57,918
Neverfails.

584
00:36:09,775 --> 00:36:11,037
Lucky stiff.

585
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,400
What're you looking at?

586
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:03,455
Samuel,

587
00:37:04,463 --> 00:37:05,521
Sami...

588
00:37:06,498 --> 00:37:07,465
Oh, Sami...

589
00:37:09,968 --> 00:37:11,435
Is it always like this?

590
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:15,968
- Where's the pleasure?
- I picked a bad time

591
00:37:16,141 --> 00:37:18,609
to tell her
we should drop it for awhile...

592
00:37:19,478 --> 00:37:22,106
that I wasn't ready to commit.

593
00:37:23,548 --> 00:37:25,038
I'll call an ambulance.

594
00:37:26,018 --> 00:37:27,679
For sure, Samuel,

595
00:37:29,621 --> 00:37:32,613
women take love
more seriously than we do.

596
00:37:33,025 --> 00:37:33,992
Right?

597
00:37:36,561 --> 00:37:39,121
Watch over Samuel.
Take care of him.

598
00:37:39,298 --> 00:37:41,493
I try, but he won't let me.

599
00:37:42,034 --> 00:37:45,470
- Take no major risks.
- Save me the cover.

600
00:37:46,638 --> 00:37:47,627
Sandra,

601
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:51,168
you'll neverwin a Pulitzer here.

602
00:37:51,743 --> 00:37:54,644
They'll tell you:
you got what you deserved.

603
00:37:54,813 --> 00:37:57,577
I love your sermons, but
we should've been in Almeria by now.

604
00:37:57,849 --> 00:38:00,249
Tell Lucas to leave you
the car he's test-driving.

605
00:38:00,585 --> 00:38:01,847
- OK.
- Almeria?

606
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,681
- Let's go.
- Bye.

607
00:38:32,017 --> 00:38:33,712
This music puts me to sleep.

608
00:38:38,223 --> 00:38:39,554
Hear the viola?

609
00:38:40,325 --> 00:38:41,553
It's Eva.

610
00:38:41,793 --> 00:38:43,522
Live from the Real Theater.

611
00:38:44,996 --> 00:38:46,657
I feel close to her that way.

612
00:41:13,712 --> 00:41:14,804
Do you have hot water?

613
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,038
Uh, yeah...

614
00:41:17,382 --> 00:41:18,747
Shitty hotel.

615
00:41:25,924 --> 00:41:27,858
Eva, it's me.

616
00:41:29,728 --> 00:41:30,752
In Almeria.

617
00:41:32,097 --> 00:41:33,029
What?

618
00:41:33,398 --> 00:41:34,660
Contra's here...

619
00:41:34,866 --> 00:41:35,924
He's staying a few days.

620
00:41:36,968 --> 00:41:38,799
Says the police
are looking for him.

621
00:41:39,471 --> 00:41:41,098
Don't tell him, he'll overreact.

622
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:42,971
That weirdo's there?

623
00:41:43,675 --> 00:41:45,074
Couldn't he go elsewhere?

624
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:46,636
He keeps me company...

625
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:48,839
and makes great breakfasts.

626
00:41:49,014 --> 00:41:50,777
Doesn't he know
he's getting you involved?

627
00:41:51,917 --> 00:41:53,441
Don't exaggerate.

628
00:41:54,019 --> 00:41:55,316
Why are you in Almeria?

629
00:41:56,555 --> 00:41:58,113
Nothing... photos.

630
00:41:58,490 --> 00:42:00,321
Landscapes...

631
00:42:08,466 --> 00:42:09,990
- Yes?
- Eva, wait a sec.

632
00:42:10,101 --> 00:42:10,999
Yes, it's me.

633
00:42:11,136 --> 00:42:12,603
Yeah, tell me.

634
00:42:13,672 --> 00:42:15,765
Eva, gotta go.
Call you later.

635
00:42:16,575 --> 00:42:17,507
Akiss.

636
00:42:18,243 --> 00:42:19,210
I love you.

637
00:42:19,377 --> 00:42:20,401
Bye...

638
00:42:25,517 --> 00:42:26,575
Hey, Contra,

639
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,153
do you think Samuel...?

640
00:42:32,457 --> 00:42:34,152
You've got to understand men.

641
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,149
It's not easy

642
00:42:36,428 --> 00:42:39,124
to live with this cock here
always giving you advice.

643
00:42:42,667 --> 00:42:44,897
- Hungry?
- Yeah.

644
00:43:59,577 --> 00:44:01,101
Sandra!
Sandra!

645
00:44:22,767 --> 00:44:24,029
Come on! Get in!

646
00:44:37,248 --> 00:44:38,875
I have the photos... I got 'em.

647
00:44:39,350 --> 00:44:40,681
The kid. Take the kid...

648
00:44:40,952 --> 00:44:41,941
My God...

649
00:44:50,795 --> 00:44:51,819
Contra...

650
00:44:52,864 --> 00:44:57,324
Didn't wanna wake you. Relax.
Keep still. Guests are coming.

651
00:44:58,069 --> 00:45:00,697
- Guests?
- Payback for the other day.

652
00:45:00,872 --> 00:45:02,339
- Listen...
- Without Samuel

653
00:45:02,674 --> 00:45:04,039
present, they'll be gentlemen.

654
00:45:04,209 --> 00:45:05,642
Listen, Contra...

655
00:45:05,810 --> 00:45:06,401
Wait!

656
00:45:07,312 --> 00:45:09,041
I just broke water...

657
00:45:11,416 --> 00:45:12,940
This is no time to faint.

658
00:45:13,918 --> 00:45:16,443
No it's just that...
these things...

659
00:45:18,723 --> 00:45:20,816
Wine from the Real Madrid
Christmas basket!

660
00:45:20,992 --> 00:45:22,687
Chicken and rice.
I could smell it.

661
00:45:22,861 --> 00:45:24,294
Did you come by car?

662
00:45:24,462 --> 00:45:26,191
- Yeah, mine.
- Well, bring it.

663
00:45:26,798 --> 00:45:28,959
Yeah, right. You know
how long it took to park?

664
00:45:29,701 --> 00:45:32,363
And Maarisa wanted us
to come by subway,

665
00:45:32,704 --> 00:45:35,798
but, of course, these guys
would hear nothing of it.

666
00:45:36,107 --> 00:45:38,405
Guys, she's broken water.
She's gonna lose the kid.

667
00:45:38,743 --> 00:45:42,008
Don't be retarded. I just need
a ride to the hospital.

668
00:45:43,915 --> 00:45:44,882
Come on.

669
00:45:51,322 --> 00:45:53,483
- We should go to the cops.
- Again?

670
00:45:54,159 --> 00:45:57,026
I know a commissioner in Madrid
who knows what I'm doing.

671
00:45:57,195 --> 00:45:58,890
Let's bring the baby there...

672
00:45:59,464 --> 00:46:01,932
- It's a girl.
- That's her problem.

673
00:46:02,367 --> 00:46:04,699
Ignore her.
She just acts tough.

674
00:46:05,403 --> 00:46:08,463
Sing it a lullaby.
You're about to be a father,

675
00:46:08,807 --> 00:46:09,865
not me.

676
00:46:11,075 --> 00:46:14,442
Pretty bird, please be sweet.
Be so nice and hush your peep.

677
00:46:15,413 --> 00:46:16,846
Little baby...

678
00:46:17,015 --> 00:46:20,109
is fast asleep.
- Singing was a bad idea.

679
00:46:20,251 --> 00:46:22,583
- Don't push now.
- Relax.

680
00:46:22,754 --> 00:46:23,880
It'll be fine.

681
00:46:24,355 --> 00:46:27,017
Maarisa used to scream
bloody hell.

682
00:46:27,192 --> 00:46:30,127
She swore and insulted
the shit out of me.

683
00:46:30,895 --> 00:46:31,862
That music...

684
00:46:34,699 --> 00:46:36,132
It's the Muzak, Doctor.

685
00:46:36,367 --> 00:46:38,096
Turn that shit off!

686
00:46:38,269 --> 00:46:40,737
I don't want my kid
to hear that crap first.

687
00:46:41,673 --> 00:46:42,867
The inventor of Muzak

688
00:46:43,041 --> 00:46:45,942
should have his balls
hammered to pieces.

689
00:46:46,678 --> 00:46:48,145
The worse is plane music.

690
00:46:48,446 --> 00:46:50,004
My fear of flying comes from

691
00:46:50,181 --> 00:46:52,376
the landing music.
- OK, push.

692
00:46:52,717 --> 00:46:53,706
Come on.

693
00:46:54,819 --> 00:46:57,253
Want me to play a song
on the guitar?

694
00:46:57,422 --> 00:46:58,684
- A soft tune?
- No.

695
00:46:59,958 --> 00:47:01,789
Contractions are nothing next

696
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:04,224
to his singing.
- Can we concentrate,

697
00:47:04,395 --> 00:47:05,225
please?

698
00:47:06,464 --> 00:47:09,058
Doctor, is it true
giving birth in water

699
00:47:09,234 --> 00:47:11,065
is more natural?
- Hey, don't ask him.

700
00:47:11,236 --> 00:47:13,170
Doctors want you to suffer.

701
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:18,267
Relax, we're here.

702
00:47:18,476 --> 00:47:20,637
- Breathe easily.
- Push harder.

703
00:47:20,879 --> 00:47:23,109
Come on, push harder.

704
00:47:23,915 --> 00:47:24,904
I feel the head!

705
00:47:25,917 --> 00:47:26,849
Breathe.

706
00:47:27,418 --> 00:47:28,783
One-two,

707
00:47:29,487 --> 00:47:31,045
one-two,

708
00:47:31,789 --> 00:47:33,416
one-two,

709
00:47:33,925 --> 00:47:36,860
one-two.
- Shut up, it sounds like marching.

710
00:47:38,162 --> 00:47:39,459
Is it out yet? Tell me.

711
00:47:40,331 --> 00:47:42,731
I wouldn't come out,
given what's waiting for him.

712
00:47:42,967 --> 00:47:44,901
OK, now push some more.
Come on.

713
00:47:45,069 --> 00:47:46,696
You can do it...

714
00:47:48,106 --> 00:47:50,700
Yeah, you can do it.
Piece of cake.

715
00:47:51,009 --> 00:47:54,069
Fuck, I'm getting dizzy,
imagining all that blood.

716
00:47:54,245 --> 00:47:56,907
- Relax, Felix.
- Let's go babe. You're the best.

717
00:47:58,449 --> 00:47:59,973
Anyone call Samuel?

718
00:48:00,151 --> 00:48:01,379
Samuel...

719
00:48:03,087 --> 00:48:04,213
- Did you call him?
- I didn't.

720
00:48:04,289 --> 00:48:04,778
Me neither.

721
00:48:07,992 --> 00:48:10,085
Ah, so you were hungry.

722
00:48:11,896 --> 00:48:13,158
Who can understand you?

723
00:48:16,034 --> 00:48:17,092
I tried reading

724
00:48:17,268 --> 00:48:21,432
those baby books.
Boy, were they boring!

725
00:48:23,007 --> 00:48:24,975
Like camera-operating manuals.

726
00:48:26,077 --> 00:48:28,272
Until you take a thousand pics,

727
00:48:29,213 --> 00:48:31,511
you understand nothing.

728
00:48:33,952 --> 00:48:35,010
My name is Samuel.

729
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:36,978
And you?

730
00:48:38,456 --> 00:48:40,219
Do you have a name?

731
00:48:46,764 --> 00:48:47,992
Here it is. I got it.

732
00:48:48,166 --> 00:48:49,258
It's here.

733
00:48:54,405 --> 00:48:55,997
Here's your baby.

734
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:04,844
Anyone volunteer to cut the cord?

735
00:49:05,583 --> 00:49:08,381
- Me, if I could.
- Uh, that stuff...

736
00:49:08,886 --> 00:49:10,581
I couldn't even with my own kids.

737
00:49:12,223 --> 00:49:15,056
- Looks like we have a volunteer.
- Well, lend a hand.

738
00:49:16,027 --> 00:49:17,324
Take the scissors.

739
00:49:21,399 --> 00:49:23,060
Come closer, cut.

740
00:49:27,705 --> 00:49:29,366
Look at it, look at it.

741
00:49:31,309 --> 00:49:33,300
Let him listen to your heart.

742
00:49:42,487 --> 00:49:44,284
Hey, first impressions mark...

743
00:49:57,268 --> 00:49:59,099
- Congrats, guys.
- Thanks.

744
00:50:05,977 --> 00:50:08,002
Eva says I flee
from responsibility.

745
00:50:09,147 --> 00:50:10,375
Eva's my girl.

746
00:50:11,916 --> 00:50:14,043
Well, she was.

747
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:16,177
I don't know.

748
00:50:18,489 --> 00:50:19,979
If you met her...

749
00:50:20,992 --> 00:50:21,981
she's great.

750
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:23,218
You'd like her.

751
00:50:25,263 --> 00:50:26,491
Are you sleepy?

752
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,797
I'd sing you another song,

753
00:50:31,369 --> 00:50:33,234
but you heard Sandra before.

754
00:50:33,471 --> 00:50:34,904
She says I sing like a dog,

755
00:50:35,073 --> 00:50:36,768
who's had his balls stepped on.

756
00:50:41,345 --> 00:50:42,471
I'm not that bad, am I?

757
00:50:44,215 --> 00:50:46,183
You know I think I like you.

758
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:49,752
Of course,

759
00:50:50,455 --> 00:50:52,116
I must be a superhero to you

760
00:50:52,290 --> 00:50:53,814
or something similar.

761
00:50:54,258 --> 00:50:55,247
Nah,

762
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:56,449
you'll see,

763
00:50:57,161 --> 00:50:58,822
people are pretty normal,

764
00:50:59,030 --> 00:51:00,463
well, not really...

765
00:51:00,898 --> 00:51:02,160
but you get used to them.

766
00:51:05,770 --> 00:51:07,761
Look, look, look...

767
00:51:39,103 --> 00:51:40,400
You know the worst?

768
00:51:41,539 --> 00:51:43,268
You'll be a great dad...

769
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:49,307
No, Sandra, no...

770
00:51:49,614 --> 00:51:51,081
Take care of Eva.

771
00:51:52,216 --> 00:51:54,241
I really liked her.
She's sweet.

772
00:51:55,586 --> 00:51:58,020
Don't know if you deserve her.

773
00:52:00,525 --> 00:52:02,584
You'll have to fight for her.

774
00:52:04,629 --> 00:52:05,994
If you fuck up

775
00:52:07,365 --> 00:52:09,560
or don't treat her right,

776
00:52:11,002 --> 00:52:12,526
I swear you'll pay for it.

777
00:52:14,505 --> 00:52:16,166
I'll be watching you.

778
00:52:29,554 --> 00:52:30,612
Yeah?

779
00:52:32,957 --> 00:52:34,117
Yeah.

780
00:52:37,895 --> 00:52:38,862
Okay.

781
00:52:39,497 --> 00:52:40,828
Okay, right.

782
00:52:44,402 --> 00:52:45,460
Congratulations.

783
00:52:47,138 --> 00:52:48,571
You just became a Dad.

784
00:52:54,845 --> 00:52:56,210
I'll take care of things.

785
00:52:56,380 --> 00:52:58,041
Go to her.

786
00:53:00,685 --> 00:53:01,674
It calms her.

787
00:53:03,387 --> 00:53:04,786
It's like a pacifier.

788
00:53:06,390 --> 00:53:07,414
Give it to me

789
00:53:08,192 --> 00:53:09,921
and kiss Eva for me.

790
00:53:45,196 --> 00:53:46,185
Sami...

791
00:53:46,430 --> 00:53:47,829
- Sami, my son.
- Mom!

792
00:53:48,065 --> 00:53:51,762
Congrats. Today is so exciting.

793
00:53:52,036 --> 00:53:54,470
Andres and I have
important news for you.

794
00:53:54,839 --> 00:53:56,033
Later, Mom, later...

795
00:53:58,509 --> 00:53:59,476
It's a boy...

796
00:53:59,877 --> 00:54:02,141
- Beautiful.
- It's all there.

797
00:54:02,313 --> 00:54:04,781
They gave it a 9.9 score.
I never got that.

798
00:54:05,149 --> 00:54:06,582
Felix cut the umbilical cord.

799
00:54:07,084 --> 00:54:08,051
- Me?
- Yeah.

800
00:54:08,219 --> 00:54:11,677
It was wonderful. Eva's
under anesthesia but she's fine.

801
00:54:11,856 --> 00:54:14,154
- What happened to you?
- It looks like me, but I didn't...

802
00:54:14,625 --> 00:54:15,683
do anything.

803
00:54:27,338 --> 00:54:29,772
That was a kid, right?

804
00:54:52,129 --> 00:54:53,061
Hello.

805
00:54:54,298 --> 00:54:55,890
I think I'm your Dad.

806
00:54:58,002 --> 00:54:59,094
How's everything?

807
00:54:59,870 --> 00:55:01,030
Sorry for the delay.

808
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:03,934
She's to blame.

809
00:55:06,711 --> 00:55:07,939
Who is she?

810
00:55:09,547 --> 00:55:10,775
I'm not exactly sure.

811
00:55:13,951 --> 00:55:15,282
You don't understand.

812
00:55:16,654 --> 00:55:18,622
I don't either.
Don't even try.

813
00:55:19,857 --> 00:55:23,156
But, be prepared.
This world's a strange place.

814
00:55:24,929 --> 00:55:26,863
The person who invented it,

815
00:55:27,298 --> 00:55:29,766
left things upside down:

816
00:55:30,901 --> 00:55:32,334
Good things...

817
00:55:34,105 --> 00:55:35,299
horrible things...

818
00:55:38,242 --> 00:55:40,142
We'll try to make do, huh?

819
00:55:40,611 --> 00:55:43,637
I'll take you to the park
so you can eat the dirt

820
00:55:43,914 --> 00:55:47,077
and hit other kids with the shovel
'cause that's what kids like.

821
00:55:47,885 --> 00:55:50,752
And I'll give you sweets
until your teeth rot.

822
00:55:52,089 --> 00:55:55,252
Your mother'll play you beautiful
music 'cause that's what she does.

823
00:55:58,028 --> 00:55:59,086
I'm a photographer,

824
00:56:00,164 --> 00:56:01,859
well, I take pictures.

825
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:03,994
They're not very good...

826
00:56:04,802 --> 00:56:06,326
Eva's the one
who does things well.

827
00:56:07,037 --> 00:56:07,969
Me?

828
00:56:08,606 --> 00:56:11,871
I take care of always
fucking things up,

829
00:56:13,344 --> 00:56:14,709
and leaving things a mess.

830
00:56:17,114 --> 00:56:18,206
But, you'll see,

831
00:56:18,783 --> 00:56:20,307
I'll be the best worst father

832
00:56:20,651 --> 00:56:22,141
that you've ever seen...

833
00:56:23,954 --> 00:56:25,945
By the way,
do you have a name yet?

834
00:56:27,758 --> 00:56:28,850
Tristan...

835
00:56:31,128 --> 00:56:32,595
His name is Tristan...

836
00:56:34,064 --> 00:56:35,088
Tristan?

837
00:56:36,867 --> 00:56:38,198
Sounds sad to me.

838
00:56:40,004 --> 00:56:41,631
The godfathers liked it...

839
00:56:45,342 --> 00:56:46,604
What happened to you?

840
00:56:53,083 --> 00:56:54,277
It's all a mess...

841
00:56:59,990 --> 00:57:01,218
I met a girl.

842
00:57:02,393 --> 00:57:04,327
Well, we bought herfor 8000 euros.

843
00:57:06,430 --> 00:57:08,159
Eight thousand, believe it?

844
00:57:09,266 --> 00:57:10,324
She's very nice.

845
00:57:10,901 --> 00:57:12,368
We can't keep her...

846
00:57:13,938 --> 00:57:15,428
But I wanted her to meet you...

847
00:57:17,708 --> 00:57:18,936
I've told her about you.

848
00:57:19,777 --> 00:57:20,744
Really?

849
00:57:22,413 --> 00:57:23,744
What did he tell you?

850
00:57:24,415 --> 00:57:25,905
Did he get syrupy?

851
00:57:30,454 --> 00:57:31,819
Are you crying?

852
00:57:34,191 --> 00:57:35,715
Not me,

853
00:57:37,027 --> 00:57:38,051
it's him...

854
00:57:38,963 --> 00:57:40,396
Take him. Give me.

855
00:58:05,322 --> 00:58:06,414
He's cute.

856
00:58:08,259 --> 00:58:09,487
Doesn't look like mine.

857
00:58:12,930 --> 00:58:14,124
Why is it crying?

858
00:58:15,065 --> 00:58:16,225
What did you do to him?

859
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:19,836
Rock him a bit.

860
00:58:20,004 --> 00:58:21,494
Maybe he wants to be breastfed?

861
00:58:24,842 --> 00:58:26,036
Hey, there's two...

862
00:58:43,561 --> 00:58:47,725
I have no idea what'll happen,
if we'll even make it work.

863
00:58:47,932 --> 00:58:48,921
I don't know.

864
00:58:50,868 --> 00:58:52,597
I guess no one's ready for life.

865
00:59:00,678 --> 00:59:01,770
Eva's right.

866
00:59:03,881 --> 00:59:05,314
Aim forfive minutes,

867
00:59:06,684 --> 00:59:07,878
then anotherfive

868
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:11,017
and five more.

869
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:18,093
What's the matter?
