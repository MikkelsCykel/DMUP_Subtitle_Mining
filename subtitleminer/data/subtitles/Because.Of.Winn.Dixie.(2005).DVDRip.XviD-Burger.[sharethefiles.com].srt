00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:05,870
(drumroll)

2
00:00:05,972 --> 00:00:08,941
(rousing orchestral
fanfare playing)

3
00:00:19,085 --> 00:00:21,315
(fanfare ends)

4
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:47,770
(birds chirping)

5
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,713
(insects buzzing)

6
00:01:01,761 --> 00:01:03,729
(ball hits ground)

7
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:10,566
Safe!

8
00:01:13,773 --> 00:01:16,298
In the beginning,
when we moved to Naomi,

9
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:18,343
it was just the preacher
and me.

10
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:22,404
Only sometimes...
most of the time, really...

11
00:01:22,515 --> 00:01:24,847
it seemed like it was me alone.

12
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:27,351
And then, one morning,
the preacher sent me

13
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:30,116
to the store for a box
of macaroni and cheese,

14
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:32,623
some white rice
and two tomatoes.

15
00:01:32,725 --> 00:01:35,717
And after that,
everything changed.

16
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:38,229
But I'm getting ahead
of myself.

17
00:01:38,331 --> 00:01:41,789
It's a good story.
Let me tell it right.

18
00:01:41,901 --> 00:01:43,869
(singing)

19
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:10,927
(church bell tolling)

20
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,157
I appreciate you comin'.
I really do.

21
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:14,528
Thank you very much.

22
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:15,862
(chuckling):
All right, have a seat in there.

23
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:16,993
- Oh, is that a...
- Good morning.

24
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:18,001
Is that for me, I hope?

25
00:02:18,104 --> 00:02:19,002
- Yes, it sure is.
- Yeah.

26
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:21,073
(singing continues)

27
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:55,399
I feel blessed
to be brought here to Naomi

28
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:58,341
to do God's work
in His new church.

29
00:02:58,444 --> 00:03:00,241
I have to admit,
I'm-I'm still trying

30
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,314
to get used to the idea
of His house being

31
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:03,643
in a convenience store.

32
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,717
(chuckles)

33
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:11,184
Nothing wrong with making church
more convenient.

34
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,953
(coughs)

35
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:21,396
(singing continues)

36
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:38,142
(singing ends)

37
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:39,718
(sighs)

38
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:43,277
I have preached in some pretty
strange places in my time.

39
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,118
Not that... not that this is
a strange place.

40
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,487
I didn't mean that.

41
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:49,153
I ju... Ah!

42
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:52,390
Opal.

43
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:54,728
Come on in.
Come on.

44
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:55,926
Sit down.

45
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:57,969
Please.

46
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,503
(whispering):
Glad you finally made it.

47
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:07,970
This is my daughter, India Opal.

48
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,673
Forgive us.
We're new here.

49
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:11,511
Still trying to find
our way around.

50
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:12,642
(chuckling)

51
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:13,912
Maybe, uh, one of you two boys
could teach Opal

52
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,784
a better shortcut
to church, hmm?

53
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:18,356
(scoffs)

54
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,449
PREACHER:
No?

55
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,619
(chuckles)

56
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:24,629
Oh, well, let-let us pray.

57
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:25,698
(sighs)

58
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,358
Our Father,
who art in Heaven...

59
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:31,164
OPAL:
It's me, God.

60
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,672
If it's not too much trouble,
I'd like some friends.

61
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,674
I don't know that many kids.

62
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,471
Only the ones from church...

63
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:40,671
and there aren't
that many here.

64
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,873
There's ol'Amanda Wilkinson,

65
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:44,609
whose face is always pinched up

66
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:48,517
like she's smellin'somethin'
real bad.

67
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:51,419
And Sweetie Pie Thomas,
who's only five years old,

68
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:55,790
still mostly a baby, and is
always suckin' on her knuckle.

69
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:58,955
And there's Dunlap
and Stevie Dewberry.

70
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:02,000
And I know they can't help it
that they're bald, God.

71
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:04,661
Their mama shaved their heads,
on account of Dunlap got fleas

72
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:07,399
in his hair
from their cat, Sadie.

73
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:08,565
(grunting)

74
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:10,074
But even the bald Dewberry boys

75
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:12,144
don't want to be
my friend, anyway.

76
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:14,543
And one more thing, God.

77
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:16,274
I miss my mama.

78
00:05:16,382 --> 00:05:21,911
Please, God, I'd really like
to see my mama again.

79
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,889
Amen.

80
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:28,154
CONGREGATION:
Amen.

81
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,897
ANNOUNCER (over television):
Unless it's good supervision.

82
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,336
PREACHER:
Opal, come on.!

83
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,170
No TV until you put
some of that stuff away.

84
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:44,573
ANNOUNCER (over television):
Brett Parker

85
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,144
in that hitting streak...

86
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,976
(ball strikes ground)

87
00:05:57,724 --> 00:06:00,750
I'll bet they already have
a new pitcher.

88
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,385
We're not moving back to Watley.

89
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:05,157
I know it's hard
movin' all the time,

90
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:08,062
but that's part of my job.

91
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:17,076
OPAL:
Up and at 'em, Daddy!

92
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:18,407
OPAL:
Up and at 'em, Daddy!

93
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:21,139
I made orange juice!

94
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:30,978
Daddy, I made orange juice!

95
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,230
Daddy!

96
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:41,892
(song on radio)

97
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,868
(song fades)

98
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:04,647
(bicycle rattling)

99
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:14,930
WOMAN (over P.A.): Well, folks,
we've got some wonderful specials today

100
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:16,797
I want to tell you about
in Aisle 3.

101
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:19,394
Uh, in the meat department,

102
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:22,872
you'll notice
the pork chops are...

103
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:28,876
(rustling)

104
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:32,448
FEMALE EMPLOYEE:
Did you see it?

105
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:34,748
MALE EMPLOYEE:
Come on. Come on.

106
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:36,321
We can get him
over here. Come on.

107
00:07:36,422 --> 00:07:37,980
MALE EMPLOYEE #2:
There he goes, that way!

108
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:41,724
FEMALE EMPLOYEE:
Oh! Get over here!

109
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:43,295
I'll get him!

110
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:45,796
Comin'-comin'
through!

111
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:47,195
WOMAN (over P.A. System):
Boyd?

112
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,861
Boyd Lee,
could you please approach

113
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,996
the produce section?

114
00:07:56,742 --> 00:07:58,073
(screaming)

115
00:07:58,177 --> 00:07:59,405
(giggles)

116
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:03,141
What... what in the Sam Hill
is goin' on?

117
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:04,443
What is goin' on?

118
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,313
WOMAN (over P.A. System):
Please report
to the produce section, Boyd.

119
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:07,681
BOYD:
I'm in the produce section.

120
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:10,381
What? What is it?

121
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,481
WOMAN (over P.A. System):
It's a dog, Boyd.

122
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:14,719
BOYD:
We can't have no dog

123
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,727
in the Winn-Dixie.

124
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:19,697
Well, don't let him get
by the eggs!

125
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:22,029
(all exclaiming)

126
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:23,761
MALE EMPLOYEE:
He's gone left! We're goin' left!

127
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,599
Look, there he goes!
Stop him! Stop him!

128
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:29,902
Hey! He's goin' around!
Go get him!

129
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,704
MALE EMPLOYEE:
I got him! I got him!

130
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:35,644
BOYD:
Tracy, go 'round that way!

131
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:36,772
Get the do...!

132
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:39,044
(sighs):
Cut him off!

133
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:40,880
MALE EMPLOYEE:
He's goin' that way!

134
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:42,511
BOYD (shouting):
No!

135
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:44,715
Get that dog!

136
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:45,722
MALE EMPLOYEE:
He's under the table!

137
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:48,225
FEMALE EMPLOYEE:
I think he's trapped now, y'all.

138
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:50,056
(giggles)

139
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:52,062
Will somebody grab
that dog, please?!

140
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:54,064
Somebody, grab that dog!

141
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:55,133
(barks)

142
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:56,633
Somebody, grab that d...

143
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:57,760
(groaning):
Oh!

144
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,338
(barking)

145
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:02,897
Get him off of me!

146
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:04,169
I don't like dogs.

147
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:05,767
Somebody, get him
off of me.

148
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:09,144
OPAL:
It's okay, sir.

149
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:12,115
All that dog wants to do
is get face-to-face with you

150
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,550
and thank you for the good time
he's havin'.

151
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:16,554
(sobbing)

152
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:17,987
Call the pound!

153
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,079
Mike, go call the pound.

154
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:20,158
OPAL:
Wait!

155
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:23,126
Don't call the pound!
That's my dog!

156
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:31,494
And then I knew
I had done somethin' big.

157
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:34,573
Maybe stupid, too.

158
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:36,164
But I couldn't help it.

159
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:39,438
I couldn't let them take
that dog to the pound.

160
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:40,512
Here, boy!

161
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:44,107
Come on, boy!

162
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:51,321
Here, Winn-Dixie!

163
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:01,758
BOYD:
Who named the dog "Winn-Dixie"?

164
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:04,199
Me. It's his name, honest.

165
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:05,497
(sniffles)

166
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,232
Don't you know better
than to bring a dog

167
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,500
in the grocery store?

168
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:09,700
OPAL:
Sorry, sir.

169
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:12,209
It won't happen again.
I promise.

170
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:17,379
Come on, Winn-Dixie.

171
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:29,184
Well, what are
all y'all lookin' at?

172
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:32,025
That dog almost ate my face off.

173
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,792
(blubbering)

174
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,274
Sit.

175
00:10:51,517 --> 00:10:53,417
Stay here.
I'll be right back.

176
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:54,918
(barks)

177
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,132
Sometimes the preacher looked

178
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:14,729
just like a turtle
hidin' inside its shell:

179
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,070
In there,
thinkin' about things,

180
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:21,237
and not ever stickin' his head
out into the world.

181
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,212
Daddy?

182
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:24,680
Yes, what is... what is it?

183
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:26,217
Wh-What is it, Opal?

184
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:28,843
I found a dog,
and I want to keep him.

185
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:31,354
You... A dog?

186
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:33,049
Now, we have been
through this before.

187
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:34,786
You do not need a dog.

188
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:36,020
I know it.

189
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:37,459
I know I don't need a dog,

190
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:39,053
but this dog needs me.

191
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:40,530
Oh, he doesn't neither need you.

192
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:41,600
He does, too!

193
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:42,998
Oh, for goodness' sakes, it don't...

194
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:44,467
Yes, it does!
Winn-Dixie!

195
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,231
Here, boy!

196
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:47,703
The last thing in the
world that we need

197
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:49,035
- is a... Uh!
- (barks)

198
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:52,641
Ow.

199
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:55,213
(grunts):
This isn't a dog. It's a horse.

200
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:56,781
And he's homeless, too.

201
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,782
Yeah, and he's got
a stink to him, too.

202
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:00,351
I know it.

203
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:04,449
Well, he needs all the help

204
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,320
he can get, right?

205
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:08,120
I could be doing my duty.

206
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,751
(sighs):
Yeah, well...

207
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:13,094
(barks)

208
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:17,163
(barking)

209
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,041
(sighs)

210
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:28,942
OPAL:
Look, he's smilin' at you.

211
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:31,573
Don't you love a dog
with a sense of humor?

212
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:39,921
Oh, would you run
and get the tweezers?

213
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:42,550
I think he's got
something stuck in his paw.

214
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,723
(sighs)

215
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:49,568
Here.

216
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:51,829
Yeah.

217
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:54,940
He's a nice dog, isn't he?

218
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,701
(sighs)

219
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:58,106
(Winn-Dixie whimpers)

220
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:00,178
He's a great dog, isn't he?

221
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,050
(whimpers)

222
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:11,313
You can't keep this dog, Opal.

223
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:12,913
Oh, please, Daddy, look at him!

224
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:14,686
He's skinny!
He's needs to be fed well.

225
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,056
- And bathed, too!
- No.

226
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:17,220
- Oh, please...
- No, no, no.

227
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:19,354
- Please!
- No! No! I said no.

228
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:21,825
(whispering):
Please?

229
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,135
(whimpers)

230
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:33,503
All right, he can stay here

231
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:34,874
while you're trying
to find him a home

232
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,174
or you figure out
where he belongs.

233
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:37,544
- He can stay?!
- Temporarily.

234
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,117
(whispering):
Yes!

235
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:40,412
You're not
keepin' him, Opal.

236
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:43,682
This is temporary, so don't
go getting your hopes up.

237
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:45,723
- (barks)
- I know it, sir.

238
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:46,883
We're not gettin'
our hopes up,

239
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:47,959
are we, Winn-Dixie?

240
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,027
- Good.
- No, no, no.

241
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:50,288
Why don't you go
make some signs

242
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:51,556
so folks'll know
that, you know,

243
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,131
you found a dog
who needs a home.

244
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:54,426
Come on, Winn-Dixie!

245
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:55,668
And a bath and a shower.

246
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:56,726
And a bath and a shower.

247
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,532
(song on radio)

248
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:37,305
Hey, hey, come back here,
Winn-Dixie!

249
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:40,344
(song ends)

250
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,783
(grunts)

251
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,375
Little miss...

252
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:49,716
you think you're using up
enough water?

253
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:52,086
Uh, we still got to rinse.

254
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:53,749
Opal, where'd you get that hose?

255
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:56,293
I didn't think you'd mind
if I borrowed it.

256
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,056
Well, I do mind!

257
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:02,400
Oh!

258
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:03,798
I'm sorry, Mr. Alfred!

259
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,427
- I'm sorry!
- Whoa!

260
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:07,300
(barking)

261
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,499
MR. ALFRED:
Come back here, you stupid dog, you!

262
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:10,267
(barks)

263
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:11,343
If I catch you,

264
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:12,808
so help me, you won't...

265
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,107
Oh!

266
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:18,183
(groans)

267
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:21,117
MR. ALFRED:
I made an exception for the kid.

268
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:24,417
But there is no exception
for that mongrel.

269
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:26,991
You see that sign
on the front of my trailer?

270
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,992
Does anybody
read my signs?

271
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,186
We're-we're
not keeping him.

272
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:31,991
We're trying to
find him a good home.

273
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:34,691
Well, hurry it up,
or I'm calling the pound.

274
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,597
(low growl)

275
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:38,670
We... (sighs)

276
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:50,006
Daddy?

277
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,844
Dry that dog off, Opal.

278
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:55,387
And dry yourself off, too.

279
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,857
You know, Winn-Dixie,
if my mom were around,

280
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,328
I bet she'd let me keep you.

281
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:06,989
Ever since we moved here,

282
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:10,000
I've been thinking
about my mama extra hard.

283
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:11,694
Opal, I hope that dog's
not in your bed.

284
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:12,896
OPAL:
Yes, sir.

285
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:15,803
L-I mean, no, sir, he's not.

286
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:17,205
(whines softly)

287
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:20,676
I really don't
know where she is.

288
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:22,940
She left
when I was only three years old.

289
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:25,312
I can't hardly remember her.

290
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:26,850
(whines softly)

291
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:29,386
PREACHER: And make sure
you got your window shut tight.

292
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:30,750
Don't want that rain gettin' in.

293
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:33,120
OPAL:
Okay.

294
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:35,650
(whines softly)

295
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:37,319
The preacher?

296
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:38,760
It's no use.

297
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:41,230
He won't talk to me at all
about her.

298
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:44,325
I bet you don't remember
your mama much, either.

299
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:47,200
So we're really alike,
you and me.

300
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:49,365
Think I should
make the preacher

301
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:50,965
tell me about her?

302
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:52,873
Mm, I'll think about it.

303
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:55,572
You're supposed to be in bed.

304
00:16:56,715 --> 00:16:59,741
Daddy,
can you tell me about Mama?

305
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:04,414
Uh, I know you don't
like to talk about her,

306
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,923
but I don't even remember
what she looked like.

307
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,755
What did she look like?

308
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,351
I don't need to know a lot.

309
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:12,259
Just a few things.

310
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,764
She'd tell you
not to stay up so late.

311
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,391
(kisses Opal)

312
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,468
(grunts)

313
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:23,973
PREACHER:
Opal.

314
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:26,135
You ready to head out
and put up those signs?

315
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:27,769
Yes, sir.

316
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,973
Hold on.

317
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:34,379
- (sneezes)
- (groans)

318
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:40,324
No, leave him here.

319
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:45,759
- Stay here.
- (whines)

320
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:47,331
Stay.

321
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:56,273
(singing)

322
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:25,268
What the...?

323
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,497
(singing continues)

324
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:36,776
God... bless it.

325
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:38,440
(Winn-Dixie barks)

326
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,112
(mournful howling)

327
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:46,851
Opal, would you bring
that dog inside, please?

328
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,324
(howling)

329
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:50,054
(whining)

330
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:52,062
Come on, Winn-Dixie.

331
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:54,257
That night,
I wrote down in my journal

332
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:56,357
that what the preacher
couldn't see

333
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,231
is that Winn-Dixie wasn't lost.

334
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:00,168
And I didn't find him.

335
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:01,762
He found me.

336
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:05,207
He was a dog
who knew how to be a friend.

337
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:11,648
(singing continues)

338
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,318
Hey, boy.

339
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:23,655
Where are we goin'?

340
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:25,992
(singing ends)

341
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,735
You like that?

342
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,395
I bet with a collar like that

343
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:36,338
you'd feel like
you belonged to somebody.

344
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:38,875
Well, maybe we
could afford it.

345
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:40,740
(coins jingling)

346
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,371
- (bell dinging)
- Winn-Dixie.

347
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:46,883
(birds chittering softly)

348
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:49,283
Hello?

349
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:50,878
BI RD (mimicking):
Hello?

350
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:52,718
(goose squawks)

351
00:19:52,824 --> 00:19:54,291
Hello.

352
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:56,623
BI RD:
Hello.

353
00:19:57,829 --> 00:20:01,128
(goose squawking loudly)

354
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,305
BI RD:
Hello.

355
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:17,541
Hello.

356
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:18,911
(squawks)

357
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:20,279
(quietly):
Hello?

358
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:21,374
(clears throat)

359
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:22,714
L-l-I'm sorry.

360
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:24,118
Do you work here?

361
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:27,556
Yeah, but we're closed.

362
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:29,251
(Winn-Dixie sniffs)

363
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:30,828
Hey. Hey.

364
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:32,226
Don't mind him.

365
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:34,322
That's just how he says hello.

366
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:38,963
Um, that's Winn-Dixie
and I'm Opal.

367
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,039
I'm, uh, Otis.

368
00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:42,197
BI RD:
Otis. (squawks)

369
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:43,365
Well, Otis,

370
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:46,501
my dog sure likes
this red collar,

371
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:48,136
but I don't get
a big enough allowance

372
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,509
to afford somethin' this fancy.

373
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:50,809
Well, look, Miss.

374
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,476
I'm mostly just here
to take care of the animals.

375
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,246
BI RD:
Otis. (squawks)

376
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:56,912
Shut up, idiot.

377
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:58,011
I was thinking

378
00:20:58,123 --> 00:20:59,613
maybe we could set up
an installment plan.

379
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:01,192
Well, I don't think
I can do that.

380
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:02,988
Well, I could work for you.

381
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,585
I could come in and
sweep the floors

382
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:06,095
and straighten
up the shelves

383
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:07,324
and take out the trash.

384
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:08,490
I could do that.

385
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,966
Well, that's what I do.

386
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:12,400
Oh.

387
00:21:12,504 --> 00:21:14,301
Well, you sure need some help.

388
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:15,737
BI RD:
Otis. Hello.

389
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:17,832
I'm real trustworthy.

390
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,467
But the only thing is,
Winn-Dixie, my dog,

391
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:21,546
he'd have to come inside with me
while I work.

392
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:24,172
He doesn't like
to be left alone.

393
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:27,150
Well, Gertrude doesn't like dogs.

394
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:29,846
She owns a pet shop
and she don't like dogs?

395
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,923
Yeah.
No, I mean, that Gertrude.

396
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:33,514
The parrot.

397
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,490
Gertrude. (squawks)

398
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:37,118
It's named
after the owner.

399
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:39,390
Doesn't like dogs.

400
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:41,056
Well, she might like Winn-Dixie.

401
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:42,394
Almost everybody does.

402
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:43,866
If the two of'em get along,

403
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,459
then could I have the job?

404
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:46,696
Mm, I don't know.

405
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:49,296
GERTRUDE:
Dog. Dog. Dog!

406
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:51,205
I know it's a dog.

407
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,800
Gertrude's a pretty bird.

408
00:21:52,911 --> 00:21:53,969
Hello.

409
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:55,969
Hello, dog.

410
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:57,070
(Winn-Dixie grunts)

411
00:21:57,182 --> 00:21:58,979
See? She likes him.

412
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:01,382
That's pretty amazing,
don't you think?

413
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,647
OTIS:
I'll be damned.

414
00:22:03,755 --> 00:22:06,223
Then we're all set, then. Thanks.

415
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,349
No, wait, Miss.

416
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:09,051
I can't-I can't
just give you a job.

417
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,492
- I can't just give you a...
- Thank you.

418
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:12,688
You won't be sorry.
I'm a real hard worker.

419
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:14,823
That's nice.
Thank you for listening.

420
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:16,958
Have a nice day, ma'am.
Have a nice day.

421
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:18,468
Little ten-year-old kid
walk in here,

422
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:20,003
make me look like a idiot.

423
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:21,436
GERTRUDE:
Shut up, idiot.

424
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:24,907
(strained breathing)

425
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,714
(grunts angrily)

426
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,087
(chuckles):
Yeah?

427
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,319
Need some help?

428
00:22:42,427 --> 00:22:45,419
Get rid of that dog.

429
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,521
Oh, Lord.

430
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:49,862
What did he, uh,

431
00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:51,458
what'd he do now?

432
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:52,559
Nothin'.

433
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:53,933
He don't have
to do nothin'.

434
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,200
I make the rules here,
and it's plain: No pets.

435
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:57,570
Well, you know,

436
00:22:57,676 --> 00:23:00,076
Opal's been very responsible
with the dog, Mr. Alfred.

437
00:23:00,178 --> 00:23:01,475
She's still lookin'
for a home.

438
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,638
Uh, well, get me a photo.

439
00:23:02,748 --> 00:23:03,874
I'll post it on eBay.

440
00:23:03,982 --> 00:23:05,711
I'll get you competing
bids within an hour.

441
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:06,875
Okay, thank you,

442
00:23:06,985 --> 00:23:08,384
but I don't think
that's necessary.

443
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:11,149
You just stay here rent-free
because I can write it off

444
00:23:11,256 --> 00:23:13,156
as a charitable donation
to the church.

445
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:16,659
But my charity stops
with that animal.

446
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:18,320
You know how much
we appreciate

447
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:20,955
the accommodation here, sir.

448
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:23,864
Call the pound.

449
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:25,197
(sighs)

450
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:26,668
Mr. Alfred, please.

451
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:28,262
I'm sure
we can work somethin' out.

452
00:23:28,373 --> 00:23:30,238
I mean, just give us
a little bit more time.

453
00:23:30,342 --> 00:23:32,970
You want a home or a dog?

454
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:36,605
Call the pound.

455
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:43,778
(crickets chirping)

456
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:45,186
Well, yeah, I just-I just figure

457
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:46,780
you got such a nice, big place
over there, you know.

458
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:49,190
And, uh, and he's, and
I'm sure he'd be fine

459
00:23:49,294 --> 00:23:50,659
with-with your other dogs.

460
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:52,093
Uh-huh.

461
00:23:52,197 --> 00:23:53,357
(Opal grunts)

462
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:55,126
- Uh-huh.
- Don't let him see you.

463
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:57,201
Uh-huh, yeah, look,
he's very playful.

464
00:23:57,302 --> 00:23:59,167
Yeah, he's great with kids.

465
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,863
Opal thinks
the world of him.

466
00:24:00,972 --> 00:24:02,803
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

467
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:06,203
Yeah. Well, listen,
if you think of somebody,

468
00:24:06,311 --> 00:24:08,404
you be sure to give me a call,
all right?

469
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:09,605
(growls softly)

470
00:24:09,714 --> 00:24:10,942
- Okay.
- Come back here, Winn-Dixie.

471
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:12,482
I hope to see you
in church on Sunday.

472
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:13,710
- (Winn-Dixie groans)
- Come on.

473
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:16,151
Okay, all right.
Bye, now.

474
00:24:16,254 --> 00:24:18,222
(song on radio)

475
00:24:21,526 --> 00:24:22,823
(vehicle approaching)

476
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,289
(song ends)

477
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,594
(Winn-Dixie barking)

478
00:24:29,701 --> 00:24:30,827
No.

479
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:32,801
OPAL:
Winn-Dixie.

480
00:24:32,904 --> 00:24:35,702
Dixie.

481
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:37,206
Dixie. No!

482
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:38,742
- Opal. Opal. Opal.
- (Winn-Dixie barking)

483
00:24:38,844 --> 00:24:40,106
Come on. Come on.
I know, I know.

484
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:41,406
- No!
- Sir, I need you to sign

485
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:43,208
- this release form, please.
- It's not right, Daddy.

486
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:44,339
- You know it isn't!
- Opal.

487
00:24:44,449 --> 00:24:45,575
(sobbing):
No!

488
00:24:45,684 --> 00:24:47,743
Stop that right now.

489
00:24:47,853 --> 00:24:49,150
- Please, Daddy.
- (Winn-Dixie barking)

490
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:50,312
He's the only friend I have!

491
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:52,856
(sobbing):
Don't take him away.

492
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:54,255
Please.

493
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:56,884
- Please.
- (Winn-Dixie whining)

494
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:59,293
(Opal crying)

495
00:24:59,397 --> 00:25:00,796
Please?

496
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:02,628
(Winn-Dixie whining)

497
00:25:02,734 --> 00:25:04,099
Wait.

498
00:25:04,202 --> 00:25:06,432
Don't take him.

499
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:08,563
What, this isn't the dog?

500
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:10,607
Uh, there's
been a mistake.

501
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:12,768
That isn't the dog.

502
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:14,573
(van door opening)

503
00:25:16,882 --> 00:25:19,180
(Winn-Dixie barks, whines)

504
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:29,759
(van doors closing)

505
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:32,659
(engine starting)

506
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,833
(sighs):
Come on. Get him inside.

507
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:37,526
Let's go.

508
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,701
OPAL:
The preacher took a loan out from church

509
00:25:43,808 --> 00:25:44,934
and paid off our rent,

510
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:47,341
but he had to promise Mr. Alfred

511
00:25:47,445 --> 00:25:49,879
that he would find Winn-Dixie a home

512
00:25:49,981 --> 00:25:51,608
before the end of summer.

513
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:54,947
I would have promised
anybody anything.

514
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:57,783
I was just so happy
to have Winn-Dixie with me.

515
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:01,825
And I was happy to have a job
at Gertrude's Pets.

516
00:26:01,927 --> 00:26:04,725
(Winn-Dixie panting)

517
00:26:09,434 --> 00:26:11,561
(Winn-Dixie whines)

518
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,568
This is our town.

519
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:20,008
See?

520
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:22,079
Kinda lonely, isn't it?

521
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:27,642
What?

522
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:29,083
(Winn-Dixie whines)

523
00:26:29,187 --> 00:26:30,518
(barks)

524
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:36,557
Hey, Winn-Dixie.

525
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:39,425
Wait... wait for me, boy.

526
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:41,931
(barks)

527
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:45,767
Hey, Winn-Dixie.

528
00:26:47,872 --> 00:26:50,306
(barks)

529
00:26:52,877 --> 00:26:53,901
(barks)

530
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:55,172
Winn-Dixie, come back here.

531
00:26:57,816 --> 00:26:59,408
That's the library.

532
00:26:59,517 --> 00:27:01,007
(barks)

533
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,677
Winn-Dixie,
you can't go in there.

534
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:04,687
It says so on the sign.

535
00:27:16,267 --> 00:27:20,169
(whispers):
Wow, look at all those books.

536
00:27:20,271 --> 00:27:23,798
(classical music playing
quietly in background)

537
00:27:29,247 --> 00:27:33,308
(snoring softly)

538
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:44,627
(music continues playing)

539
00:27:44,729 --> 00:27:46,856
(woman screams)

540
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:49,297
(gasps):
Oh, my goodness.

541
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:53,360
(woman panting)

542
00:27:53,471 --> 00:27:55,098
Are you all right?

543
00:27:55,206 --> 00:27:56,605
(panting):
It's a bear.

544
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:57,732
A bear?

545
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:58,968
It's a bear.
He's come back.

546
00:27:59,077 --> 00:28:00,305
- He has?
- Yes. Yes.

547
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:02,039
Where is he?

548
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:03,978
(panting):
He's right out there.

549
00:28:04,082 --> 00:28:05,276
That's no bear.

550
00:28:05,383 --> 00:28:06,577
That's just a dog.

551
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,778
It's my dog, Winn-Dixie.

552
00:28:08,887 --> 00:28:09,945
A dog?

553
00:28:10,055 --> 00:28:11,852
Oh. I...

554
00:28:11,956 --> 00:28:13,287
It's your dog?

555
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:15,359
Oh. You sure?

556
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,189
Yes, ma'am, I'm positive.

557
00:28:17,295 --> 00:28:19,559
I'd know him anywhere.

558
00:28:19,664 --> 00:28:21,894
- All right.
- Let me help you up.

559
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,297
- Oh.
- Come on.

560
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:25,369
(woman panting)

561
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:27,700
- (sighs)
- It's okay.

562
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:29,706
Mm.

563
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:31,207
(panting)

564
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:32,867
Wh-Who are you?

565
00:28:32,977 --> 00:28:34,467
- I'm India Opal.
- Oh.

566
00:28:34,579 --> 00:28:36,206
But you can just call me Opal.

567
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:37,747
Well, I'm Miss Franny.

568
00:28:37,849 --> 00:28:39,749
You must think
I'm a silly ol' thing

569
00:28:39,851 --> 00:28:41,250
mistaking a dog for a bear.

570
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:43,183
Are you sure that is a dog?

571
00:28:43,288 --> 00:28:44,915
Yes, ma'am.

572
00:28:45,023 --> 00:28:46,786
- I'm sure.
- Hmm.

573
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:49,917
He just don't like to
be left alone is all.

574
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:52,087
Mm-hmm.

575
00:28:52,197 --> 00:28:54,256
Sorry to bother you,
Miss Franny.

576
00:28:54,365 --> 00:28:56,890
Well, l-I had a bad experience
with a bear

577
00:28:57,001 --> 00:28:59,765
coming into Herman W. Block
Memorial Library,

578
00:28:59,871 --> 00:29:02,169
and I've never quite
gotten over it.

579
00:29:02,273 --> 00:29:04,605
A bear came into the library?

580
00:29:04,709 --> 00:29:05,801
Oh, yes.

581
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,673
It's quite a story.

582
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:10,247
Sure would like to hear it.

583
00:29:10,348 --> 00:29:13,340
But Winn-Dixie
gets lonely without me.

584
00:29:13,451 --> 00:29:15,612
(sighs):
Well...

585
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:19,019
maybe we could
make an exception.

586
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:21,991
Now, one hot Thursday,
way back then,

587
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:23,993
I was sittin' here
in the library,

588
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:26,586
and all the doors and windows
were wide open.

589
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:28,859
And I had my nose in a book

590
00:29:28,967 --> 00:29:32,926
until I noticed
a very peculiar smell.

591
00:29:33,037 --> 00:29:37,098
A very strong smell.

592
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:40,268
And I raised
my eyes up slowly

593
00:29:40,378 --> 00:29:44,474
and standing
right in front of me was a bear.

594
00:29:44,582 --> 00:29:46,345
- (roaring)
- A very large bear.

595
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,043
How large was it?

596
00:29:48,153 --> 00:29:50,781
At least four times

597
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:52,254
the size of your dog.

598
00:29:52,357 --> 00:29:54,791
That big?

599
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:56,918
Wow.

600
00:29:57,028 --> 00:29:58,518
Then what happened?

601
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:02,088
I very slowly

602
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:06,398
and very carefully raised up
the book I was reading.

603
00:30:06,504 --> 00:30:07,994
What book was that?

604
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:09,130
War and Peace.

605
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:12,505
And I carefully aimed it,
and I threw it

606
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:13,907
right at him!

607
00:30:14,012 --> 00:30:15,639
- Be gone!
- (Winn-Dixie barks)

608
00:30:15,747 --> 00:30:16,736
(laughs)

609
00:30:16,848 --> 00:30:18,076
Good dog.

610
00:30:18,183 --> 00:30:19,514
Thank you.

611
00:30:19,617 --> 00:30:21,244
(barks happily)

612
00:30:21,352 --> 00:30:23,149
And do you know what?

613
00:30:23,254 --> 00:30:24,448
No, ma'am. What?

614
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:27,047
This is why I will never forget.

615
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:30,821
He took the book with him.

616
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:31,987
Nuh-uh.

617
00:30:32,096 --> 00:30:33,688
Yes, ma'am,
he snatched it up

618
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:35,163
and ran off.

619
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:36,631
(bear snorts)

620
00:30:36,734 --> 00:30:38,668
Did he ever come back?

621
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:39,998
No.

622
00:30:40,104 --> 00:30:42,402
I never saw him again.

623
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:45,032
Well, the men in town,
they used to tease me about it.

624
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:46,474
They used to say, "Miss Franny,

625
00:30:46,578 --> 00:30:49,570
"we saw that bear of yours
out in the woods today.

626
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:51,478
"He was reading
War and Peace

627
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:52,982
"and said it sure was good,

628
00:30:53,084 --> 00:30:55,211
and he'd like
to check it out again. '

629
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,345
(bear snorts)

630
00:30:57,455 --> 00:30:58,922
(chuckles)

631
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:03,426
Ah, I imagine I'm the only one
who even recalls that bear.

632
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:05,189
(whines)

633
00:31:05,296 --> 00:31:07,764
You don't have a husband
or children?

634
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:10,494
Mm, I never married.

635
00:31:10,602 --> 00:31:11,830
Why not?

636
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:15,405
I didn't have the need.

637
00:31:15,506 --> 00:31:18,532
But you don't have anyone.

638
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:21,043
I have these books.

639
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:23,976
Now, look at that.

640
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:27,574
That dog is smilin' at me.

641
00:31:27,685 --> 00:31:29,482
(Miss Franny chuckles)

642
00:31:29,587 --> 00:31:31,316
Would you like to be friends?

643
00:31:31,422 --> 00:31:33,413
You and me and Winn-Dixie?

644
00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:38,555
Would you wanna
be friends?

645
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:42,326
Why, that would be fine.

646
00:31:42,433 --> 00:31:45,061
That would be grand.

647
00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:46,431
Just grand.

648
00:31:46,537 --> 00:31:49,233
OPAL:
Winn-Dixie was better

649
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:51,865
at makin'friends
than anyone I had ever known.

650
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:54,137
I talked to him
about everything.

651
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:56,679
And he was
a real good listener.

652
00:31:56,781 --> 00:31:59,648
(whines)

653
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:02,618
Just about everything good
that happened that summer

654
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,383
happened because of Winn-Dixie.

655
00:32:06,491 --> 00:32:08,049
(Opal kisses Winn-Dixie)

656
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,150

[Music] Hey... [music]

GERTRUDE:
Dog.

00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:22,399

676
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,024

- Otis, the animals.

Help me here.

00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:31,697
Oh, God.

681
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:34,539
- (barking)
- Stop it, Winn-Dixie.

682
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:36,871
- Ah. Ooh.
- (Winn-Dixie barking)

683

OTIS:
Help me get 'em back in the...

684
00:33:38,549 --> 00:33:40,278
- Ooh.
...cages.

685
00:33:40,385 --> 00:33:41,613
I'll get the rabbits.

686
00:33:41,719 --> 00:33:43,186
(piglet squealing)

687

- (animals squawking)

692
00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:53,223
Sarah, come here, sweetie.

693
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:54,958

(animals squawking

698
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,973
OPAL:
Play some more music.

699
00:34:04,075 --> 00:34:05,337
What?

700
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:08,810
What I said was,
play some more music, Otis.

701
00:34:08,913 --> 00:34:11,780
(animals squawking
frantically)

705
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:23,318
Far out.
Do it again.

(animals chitter contentedly)

709
00:34:38,176 --> 00:34:40,508
Well, it seems
to be working.

710
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:50,351
(bell dinging)

711
00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:55,686
I'm gonna go tell my ma
about what I seen.

712
00:34:55,793 --> 00:34:57,852
That man's magic.

713
00:34:57,962 --> 00:35:00,123
He's a magic man.

714
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:02,897
Bye, Magic Man.

715
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,695
- (bell dinging)
- Bye, Opal.

716
00:35:04,802 --> 00:35:08,795
(guitar continues playing)

717
00:35:16,814 --> 00:35:19,009
Are you really a magic man?

718
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:21,415
I was just playin'
for the animals.

719
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:23,146
Uh...

720
00:35:23,254 --> 00:35:24,881
(whimpers)

721
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:29,050
They seem to...
they seem to like it.

722
00:35:30,094 --> 00:35:32,062
Yes, sir.

723
00:35:32,163 --> 00:35:34,825
Did they escape
from their cages?

724
00:35:34,932 --> 00:35:38,527
No, I left the cages open.

725
00:35:42,406 --> 00:35:44,806
You just let 'em roam around?

726
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:46,137
I don't know.

727
00:35:46,244 --> 00:35:48,405
It's... it's no good
bein' locked up, though.

728
00:35:48,513 --> 00:35:49,707
GERTRUDE:
Locked up.

729
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:50,906
Shut up.

730
00:35:51,015 --> 00:35:53,643
Shut up, idiot.

731
00:35:56,087 --> 00:35:58,248
Shouldn't you be sweepin' up?

732
00:35:58,356 --> 00:36:00,483
(clears throat)

733
00:36:01,592 --> 00:36:02,854
Why don't you sweep up?

734
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:03,927
With your guitar?

735
00:36:05,062 --> 00:36:09,055
Just sweep up the place and...

736
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:12,796
clean it up a little bit,
this mess.

737
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:20,504
[Music] Hey... [music]

738
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:22,238
(guitar music continues)

739
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:26,783

(door squeaks)

744
00:36:46,971 --> 00:36:49,963
He doesn't want to
be left alone is all.

745
00:36:50,074 --> 00:36:51,632
Can't we bring him?

746
00:36:51,742 --> 00:36:53,607
Can't bring a dog
to church, Opal.

747
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:55,303
Come on. We're
gonna be late.

748
00:36:55,413 --> 00:36:56,971
It's a big day for me.

749
00:36:57,081 --> 00:36:59,140
He's scared we'll
leave him for good

750
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:00,274
and never come back.

751
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:02,409
(whines)

752
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,215
That mutt ain't got
a home yet?

753
00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:06,552
Uh, no, not yet, but
we're workin' on it.

754
00:37:06,657 --> 00:37:08,784
I had a dog like that once, myself.

755
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:11,555
A real howler.

756
00:37:11,662 --> 00:37:13,061
I got him to shut up.

757
00:37:13,164 --> 00:37:14,290
You did? How?

758
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:15,922
I shot him.

759
00:37:16,033 --> 00:37:18,524
Well, you can't shoot
a church-goin' dog.

760
00:37:18,636 --> 00:37:20,365
It'd be a sin.

761
00:37:20,471 --> 00:37:21,802
(barking)

762
00:37:30,448 --> 00:37:34,646

[Music]... but now I see [music]

00:38:07,985 --> 00:38:11,819
[Music] 'Twas grace that taught [music]

773

[Music] My heart to fear [music]

[Music] How precious did... [music]

781
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:32,676
All right, all right!

782
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:33,835
That's enough. That's enough.

783
00:38:33,944 --> 00:38:35,639
Please, stop.
Everyone just stop, please.

784
00:38:35,746 --> 00:38:37,509
- Please.
- (music trails off)

785
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:39,310
Thank you.

786
00:38:39,417 --> 00:38:40,384
Opal.

787
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:42,315
He doesn't know
the words is all.

788
00:38:44,422 --> 00:38:47,858
But he sure is moved
by the spirit.

789
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:49,220
(congregation chuckles)

790
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:50,692
Get that dog, now.

791
00:38:50,795 --> 00:38:51,921
Yes, sir.

792
00:38:52,029 --> 00:38:53,155
Oh, my stars!

793
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:06,334
(congregation chuckles
and murmurs)

794
00:39:06,444 --> 00:39:08,435
It's a face
only a mother could love.

795
00:39:12,717 --> 00:39:14,912
Are dogs allowed in church?

796
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:18,716
(whispers):
Sit. Sit.

797
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:23,493
We, uh, we recently celebrated

798
00:39:23,594 --> 00:39:26,791
the hundredth anniversary
of man learning to fly.

799
00:39:26,897 --> 00:39:28,694
Now, that's the sort of miracle

800
00:39:28,799 --> 00:39:31,563
that we tend to take
for granted nowadays.

801
00:39:31,669 --> 00:39:33,136
But for hundreds of years,

802
00:39:33,237 --> 00:39:36,400
man was taking that same kind
of leap of faith...

803
00:39:36,507 --> 00:39:38,441
and falling right on his butt.

804
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:39,668
(chuckling)

805
00:39:39,777 --> 00:39:42,905
Yep, folks, they was
tyin' themselves to kites

806
00:39:43,013 --> 00:39:46,676
and homemade wings and hurlin'
themselves off of barns

807
00:39:46,784 --> 00:39:48,718
and crashin' off of cliffs.

808
00:39:48,819 --> 00:39:50,753
So how did
the Wright brothers do it?

809
00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:54,222
When everybody else was
nose-divin' for centuries?

810
00:39:54,325 --> 00:39:57,123
They saw...

811
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:59,628
(whispering):
Don't even think about it.

812
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,664
...the unique value in all
the inventors around 'em.

813
00:40:01,766 --> 00:40:03,165
Did you know that part
of their wing design

814
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:06,464
was actually the same design
as a railroad bridge?

815
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:07,730
- Yeah.
- No.

816
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:08,930
Isn't that a genius leap?

817
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:11,132
Usin' a bridge to fly?

818
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:12,504
(barking)

819
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:14,601
- (congregation murmurs)
- Keep on preaching!

820
00:40:14,712 --> 00:40:15,906
I got him!
I got him!

821
00:40:16,013 --> 00:40:17,605
And more importantly,
they had each other...

822
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:18,704
(screaming and yelling)

823
00:40:18,816 --> 00:40:20,283
...working as brothers,
as a team.

824
00:40:20,384 --> 00:40:21,612
It's the same reason we have...

825
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:22,913
(congregation exclaiming)

826
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:24,180
Whoa! Look at him go!

827
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:28,959
Working together,
we can lift this town up!

828
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:30,720
(barking)

829
00:40:32,897 --> 00:40:37,698
More than just taking a leap
of faith, we can learn to fly!

830
00:40:37,802 --> 00:40:39,201
Sorry!

831
00:40:39,303 --> 00:40:41,294
(women screaming)

832
00:40:41,405 --> 00:40:43,430
Opal, stop that dog!

833
00:40:45,075 --> 00:40:46,440
(barking)

834
00:40:49,914 --> 00:40:51,438
(disgusted murmuring)

835
00:40:58,389 --> 00:41:00,983
WOMAN:
Mm, mm, mm.

836
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,625
(all gasp)

837
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:11,396
Never in my life.

838
00:41:11,502 --> 00:41:13,561
A dog catchin' a mouse.

839
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:26,508
(murmuring)

840
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,015
(sighs)

841
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:40,920
Let us pray...

842
00:41:46,971 --> 00:41:49,963
for this mouse.

843
00:41:50,074 --> 00:41:51,905
(laughter)

844
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:18,524
OPAL:
That sure was somethin'.

845
00:42:18,636 --> 00:42:21,605
I bet Mama would have gotten
a big kick out of it.

846
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:24,037
Opal, the dog cannot
go back to church.

847
00:42:24,141 --> 00:42:25,403
Everybody was talkin'.

848
00:42:25,509 --> 00:42:26,999
They said they
hadn't had

849
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:29,671
that much fun in church
in a long while.

850
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:30,940
Opal.

851
00:42:57,474 --> 00:42:59,305
Doesn't it look better?

852
00:43:03,314 --> 00:43:04,576
(barks)

853
00:43:04,682 --> 00:43:07,242
Now where you takin' me,
Winn-Dixie?

854
00:43:07,351 --> 00:43:09,478
DUNLAP:
That dog looks like a dirty carpet.!

855
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:10,679
(boys giggle)

856
00:43:10,788 --> 00:43:12,153
Yeah.

857
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:13,314
I can hear you.

858
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:15,892
I can hear you guys behind me.

859
00:43:15,993 --> 00:43:18,154
You better watch out!

860
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:19,923
That dog's headed right
for the witch's house.

861
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:22,055
Winn-Dixie, come back here!

862
00:43:25,169 --> 00:43:26,659
Winn-Dixie!

863
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:29,102
You better go get
your dog out of there.

864
00:43:29,206 --> 00:43:33,336
Get lost,
you bald-headed babies!

865
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:35,503
Hey, that witch is gonna
eat that dog for dinner

866
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:36,773
and you for dessert!

867
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,371
I wouldn't go in there,
Baloney Breath.

868
00:43:39,483 --> 00:43:40,609
Baloney Breath?

869
00:43:40,718 --> 00:43:44,745
You're just a couple
of skinny-armed chickens.

870
00:43:47,091 --> 00:43:49,218
We'll tell the preacher
what happened to you.

871
00:44:10,581 --> 00:44:12,742
(whispering):
Winn-Dixie?

872
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:15,080
Winn-Dixie, where are you?

873
00:44:20,691 --> 00:44:23,125
WOMAN:
Give me this, I said.

874
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:27,558
Let it go. Let it go!

875
00:44:28,766 --> 00:44:31,394
Give it! Give it to me!

876
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:32,764
(grunts softly)

877
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:33,928
Let it go, I said.

878
00:44:34,038 --> 00:44:35,869
- Stop it!
- Oh!

879
00:44:35,973 --> 00:44:37,497
(grunts, then gasps)

880
00:44:39,576 --> 00:44:40,770
Who's there?

881
00:44:40,878 --> 00:44:43,540
(shuddering):
Um, please don't eat me.

882
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:44,841
D-D...

883
00:44:44,948 --> 00:44:46,108
Don't eat me!

884
00:44:46,216 --> 00:44:47,547
I don't taste good!
I don't taste good!

885
00:44:47,651 --> 00:44:49,209
Please, help!

886
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:50,445
Eat you?

887
00:44:50,554 --> 00:44:52,021
You silly child.

888
00:44:52,122 --> 00:44:53,783
How can I eat you?

889
00:44:53,891 --> 00:44:57,122
(laughs)

890
00:44:57,227 --> 00:44:58,524
Where's my dog?

891
00:44:58,629 --> 00:45:00,119
Did you eat my dog?

892
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:02,994
Hardly.

893
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:06,968
But he darn near bit my hand off
stealing my sandwich!

894
00:45:07,071 --> 00:45:10,700
Where is he?
Where is the dog?

895
00:45:10,808 --> 00:45:11,866
Where's the dog?

896
00:45:17,981 --> 00:45:20,506
Where is the d...

897
00:45:20,617 --> 00:45:21,982
Oh, I hear him.
I hear him.

898
00:45:22,086 --> 00:45:23,314
He's smackin' his lip.

899
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:25,479
He sure love peanut butter.

900
00:45:25,589 --> 00:45:28,217
Listen at him.

901
00:45:28,325 --> 00:45:29,553
(laughs)

902
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:31,924
I'm sorry I got
on your property.

903
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,389
Hmm.

904
00:45:37,501 --> 00:45:39,332
My name's Opal.

905
00:45:39,436 --> 00:45:45,602
My name is... Gloria.
Gloria Dump.

906
00:45:45,709 --> 00:45:48,234
Isn't that
a terrible last name?

907
00:45:48,345 --> 00:45:49,369
Dump?

908
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,641
Well, my last name's Buloni.

909
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:54,912
Sometimes the kids at school,
they call me Lunch Meat.

910
00:45:55,018 --> 00:45:57,009
"Lunch Meat."

911
00:45:57,121 --> 00:45:58,884
(chuckling):
Oh, my.

912
00:45:58,989 --> 00:46:02,823
Well, I'm pleased
to meet you, Lunch Meat.

913
00:46:04,294 --> 00:46:07,058
What you call
your friend here?

914
00:46:07,164 --> 00:46:09,189
- Oh, that's Winn-Dixie.
- Winn-Dixie?

915
00:46:09,299 --> 00:46:11,426
You mean like the grocery store?

916
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:16,303
Now, that takes the
strange-name prize, don't it?

917
00:46:16,406 --> 00:46:19,000
Woo-wee!

918
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:21,600
(laughs)

919
00:46:27,518 --> 00:46:28,485
(whines)

920
00:46:28,585 --> 00:46:32,021
Oh, no. Hmm-mm.
This one's mine.

921
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:34,647
I'm gon' eat this one.

922
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:40,021
You know, baby girl...

923
00:46:41,331 --> 00:46:42,559
these eyes of mine,

924
00:46:42,666 --> 00:46:44,998
they don't see
too good no more.

925
00:46:45,102 --> 00:46:46,194
You can't see?

926
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:49,431
Well... you know, I can...

927
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:52,998
I can see only
the general shape

928
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:54,805
of things.

929
00:46:54,912 --> 00:46:57,540
So I rely on my heart.

930
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:01,481
Why don't you go ahead and tell
me everything about yourself,

931
00:47:01,585 --> 00:47:03,416
so I can see you with my heart?

932
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:08,014
Well, the first thing you should
know about me is that...

933
00:47:08,125 --> 00:47:09,752
my dad's the preacher,

934
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:11,657
which was why
we moved to Naomi.

935
00:47:11,762 --> 00:47:13,730
OPAL:
I had been waiting for so long

936
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:15,628
to tell a person
everything about me,

937
00:47:15,732 --> 00:47:16,824
I couldn't stop.

938
00:47:16,934 --> 00:47:18,902
I told Gloria Dump everything.

939
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:21,061
And the whole time
I was talkin',

940
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:22,832
Gloria Dump was listening.

941
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:24,703
I see, I see.

942
00:47:24,808 --> 00:47:28,710
But the most important thing
you should know about me...

943
00:47:28,812 --> 00:47:30,177
is that I don't have a mama.

944
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:32,111
You don't have a mama.

945
00:47:32,216 --> 00:47:35,242
Somethin' happened to her
that made her go away,

946
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:37,149
and I don't know
what it was.

947
00:47:38,889 --> 00:47:40,447
Well, then the Dewberry boys...

948
00:47:40,557 --> 00:47:43,287
OPAL: I could feel her listening
with all her heart.

949
00:47:43,393 --> 00:47:45,623
And it felt good.

950
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:57,530
(rain pattering)

951
00:47:57,641 --> 00:47:59,165
(whining)

952
00:47:59,276 --> 00:48:02,439
(thunder rumbling)

953
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:04,707
(barking and whining)

954
00:48:04,815 --> 00:48:07,215
Winn-Dixie?

955
00:48:07,317 --> 00:48:08,841
(whispering):
What's wrong, boy?

956
00:48:08,952 --> 00:48:09,919
Quiet!

957
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:11,612
You'll wake the preacher.

958
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:13,246
(thunder rumbling)

959
00:48:13,357 --> 00:48:15,587
Winn-Dixie.

960
00:48:15,692 --> 00:48:19,128
(whispering):
Winn-Dixie, come back here!

961
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:22,460
- (whining)
- (startled yell)

962
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:24,591
Opal!

963
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:27,127
Opal!

964
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:30,001
(thunder cracks, whining)

965
00:48:30,107 --> 00:48:31,836
What's going on with that dog?

966
00:48:31,942 --> 00:48:33,500
- (glass shattering)
- I don't know!

967
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:35,737
Come on, Winn-Dixie.
Come on, come on!

968
00:48:35,846 --> 00:48:36,835
Come...

969
00:48:36,947 --> 00:48:38,505
(yells):
Winn-Dixie!

970
00:48:38,615 --> 00:48:39,741
Daddy, I'm sorry.

971
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:41,647
I don't know
what's gotten into him.

972
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:43,982
It's just thunder.
It's okay.

973
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:48,323
(thunder cracks)

974
00:48:51,361 --> 00:48:53,295
Daddy, what if he hurts himself?

975
00:48:53,397 --> 00:48:54,989
What if he tries
to get away?!

976
00:48:57,567 --> 00:48:59,194
Daddy, what's happening?!

977
00:49:00,337 --> 00:49:01,634
Let's get out of the way.

978
00:49:08,745 --> 00:49:09,973
Oh...

979
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:13,015
Do you know what
a pathological fear is?

980
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:14,242
No, sir.

981
00:49:14,351 --> 00:49:16,478
It is a fear that goes way
beyond normal fears.

982
00:49:16,586 --> 00:49:18,884
It's a fear that you
can't be talked out of,

983
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:20,547
you can't be reasoned out of.

984
00:49:20,657 --> 00:49:21,715
And I think Winn-Dixie

985
00:49:21,825 --> 00:49:23,292
has a pathological fear
of thunderstorms.

986
00:49:25,996 --> 00:49:29,727
(thunder cracks)

987
00:49:29,833 --> 00:49:31,824
(sighs)

988
00:49:31,935 --> 00:49:35,393
(whimpering, clattering)

989
00:49:35,505 --> 00:49:41,068
(racing footfalls)

990
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:52,747
(whining)

991
00:50:03,533 --> 00:50:08,334
We get an awful lot of
thunderstorms in the summer.

992
00:50:12,976 --> 00:50:14,637
Well, I'm gonna have
to make sure

993
00:50:14,745 --> 00:50:16,508
he doesn't get out
during a storm.

994
00:50:16,613 --> 00:50:18,774
Might run away.

995
00:50:18,882 --> 00:50:21,976
We'll have to make sure
we keep him safe.

996
00:50:22,085 --> 00:50:24,280
Yes, sir.

997
00:50:24,388 --> 00:50:26,788
(chuckles softly)

998
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:46,737
I've been talkin'
to Winn-Dixie.

999
00:50:46,843 --> 00:50:48,777
Oh, is that right?

1000
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:52,743
He thinks,
since I'm ten years old,

1001
00:50:52,849 --> 00:50:54,908
you should tell me ten things
about my mama.

1002
00:50:58,021 --> 00:51:01,548
Why don't you just
go back to bed, Opal?

1003
00:51:07,764 --> 00:51:10,324
Just ten things, that's all.

1004
00:51:10,434 --> 00:51:12,493
One thing for each year
I've been alive.

1005
00:51:12,602 --> 00:51:15,765
He made it sound like
a reasonable request.

1006
00:51:17,808 --> 00:51:20,242
I should've known
you'd be more trouble.

1007
00:51:20,343 --> 00:51:22,470
(barks)

1008
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:27,849
You remind me
so much of your mama.

1009
00:51:27,951 --> 00:51:30,010
Yeah?

1010
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:31,917
Mm-hmm.

1011
00:51:32,022 --> 00:51:34,422
But that doesn't count
as the first thing, okay?

1012
00:51:34,524 --> 00:51:38,722
Okay, all right.

1013
00:51:38,829 --> 00:51:45,496
Ten things... and then
it's off to bed, all right?

1014
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:47,001
Okay, let's see.

1015
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:49,129
One: She was funny.

1016
00:51:49,239 --> 00:51:51,537
She could make
just about anybody laugh.

1017
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:58,509
Two: She had fair hair
and big eyes.

1018
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:00,640
Just like me.

1019
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:03,344
Exactly like you.

1020
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:05,318
I kinda remember that.

1021
00:52:05,422 --> 00:52:06,514
Do ya?

1022
00:52:08,925 --> 00:52:11,223
Mm? Good.

1023
00:52:11,328 --> 00:52:12,955
Three: She liked
to plant things.

1024
00:52:13,063 --> 00:52:14,291
She had a talent for it.

1025
00:52:14,397 --> 00:52:16,729
She could stick a tire
in the ground and grow a car.

1026
00:52:20,337 --> 00:52:23,966
Four: She could run.
Oh, was she fast!

1027
00:52:24,074 --> 00:52:25,507
You couldn't ever
race her, you know.

1028
00:52:25,609 --> 00:52:26,576
I mean, if you did,

1029
00:52:26,676 --> 00:52:27,904
y-you couldn't let her
get a head start.

1030
00:52:28,011 --> 00:52:29,205
Otherwise, she'd
beat you for sure.

1031
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:31,712
What's number five?

1032
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:35,677
She couldn't cook.

1033
00:52:35,785 --> 00:52:38,185
Burned everything, even water.

1034
00:52:38,288 --> 00:52:39,346
(chuckles)

1035
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:44,426
Six: Your mama
loved a good story.

1036
00:52:44,528 --> 00:52:47,429
She could sit and listen
to anybody tell a story.

1037
00:52:47,531 --> 00:52:49,658
She especially liked
funny ones, mm-hmm.

1038
00:52:49,766 --> 00:52:51,757
'Cause she loved to laugh.

1039
00:52:51,868 --> 00:52:54,530
What's number seven?

1040
00:52:57,807 --> 00:53:00,139
She knew all the constellations.

1041
00:53:00,243 --> 00:53:02,609
Every planet
in the nighttime sky.

1042
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:07,381
And she could name 'em,
you know?

1043
00:53:07,484 --> 00:53:08,610
Point 'em out.

1044
00:53:08,718 --> 00:53:11,448
She never got tired
of looking up at 'em.

1045
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:15,089
Number eight...

1046
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:23,992
She hated being
a preacher's wife.

1047
00:53:31,675 --> 00:53:36,112
She said she couldn't stand

1048
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:40,047
havin' all those ladies
at church judgin' her

1049
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:44,519
on how she sang and what she was
wearing and what she cooked.

1050
00:53:44,621 --> 00:53:47,852
She said it made her feel
like a bug under a microscope.

1051
00:53:54,164 --> 00:53:56,598
What's the ninth thing?

1052
00:53:56,700 --> 00:54:01,467
Number nine... is...

1053
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:03,061
your mama loved you.

1054
00:54:03,173 --> 00:54:05,266
She loved you very much.

1055
00:54:05,375 --> 00:54:06,672
But she left me.

1056
00:54:06,776 --> 00:54:09,438
She left us.

1057
00:54:09,546 --> 00:54:12,014
Why'd she leave us?

1058
00:54:12,115 --> 00:54:15,642
She just...

1059
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:18,778
packed her bags and left us.

1060
00:54:18,888 --> 00:54:22,085
Just... yeah.

1061
00:54:22,192 --> 00:54:24,592
Didn't leave one thing behind.

1062
00:54:24,694 --> 00:54:27,128
She didn't leave anything?

1063
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:28,595
Nope.

1064
00:54:28,698 --> 00:54:30,290
Nothin'.

1065
00:54:35,171 --> 00:54:37,799
What's number ten, Daddy?

1066
00:54:40,910 --> 00:54:42,673
I think that's enough for now.

1067
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:45,179
But that's only nine things.

1068
00:54:48,318 --> 00:54:50,081
It's late.

1069
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:53,854
You'll think of number ten
for me, won't you?

1070
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:56,016
Good night, Opal.

1071
00:55:01,831 --> 00:55:04,732
(woman laughing)

1072
00:55:10,206 --> 00:55:14,700
PREACHER: She could stick a tire
in the ground and grow a car.

1073
00:55:17,447 --> 00:55:18,880
(engine running)

1074
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:20,574
(laughing)

1075
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:25,977
Burned everything.
Even water.

1076
00:55:31,227 --> 00:55:33,627
She knew
all the constellations.

1077
00:55:36,232 --> 00:55:39,133
She hated bein'
a preacher's wife.

1078
00:55:39,235 --> 00:55:42,204
It made her feel like a bug
under a microscope.

1079
00:55:43,306 --> 00:55:45,501
(screen door creaking)

1080
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:56,550
OPAL: That night,
I went over and over in my head

1081
00:55:56,653 --> 00:55:58,951
the nine things
that the preacher had told me.

1082
00:55:59,055 --> 00:56:00,147
Then I wrote them down

1083
00:56:00,256 --> 00:56:02,247
just the way he had
said them to me.

1084
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:05,726
That way, I would
never forget them.

1085
00:56:07,097 --> 00:56:10,362
(birds cawing)

1086
00:56:15,238 --> 00:56:17,069
Oh...

1087
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:30,277
(singing)

1088
00:56:54,978 --> 00:56:58,539
He shouldn't be away
from his mom too long

1089
00:56:58,648 --> 00:57:00,809
when they're this small.

1090
00:57:03,219 --> 00:57:06,655
(singing continues)

1091
00:57:07,791 --> 00:57:09,691
What kind of tree is this?

1092
00:57:09,793 --> 00:57:11,988
It's a wait-and-see tree.

1093
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:13,357
What's that mean?

1094
00:57:13,463 --> 00:57:16,193
It means you got to
wait till it grows up

1095
00:57:16,299 --> 00:57:18,927
before you can
see what it is.

1096
00:57:19,035 --> 00:57:20,093
Tight?

1097
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:23,933
Well?

1098
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:28,977
(singing continues)

1099
00:57:35,919 --> 00:57:37,580
(singing ends)

1100
00:57:37,687 --> 00:57:39,086
MAN:
So you just drifted

1101
00:57:39,189 --> 00:57:40,213
on into town.

1102
00:57:40,323 --> 00:57:41,483
OTIS:
I told you everything.

1103
00:57:41,591 --> 00:57:42,717
Mornin', Otis.

1104
00:57:43,827 --> 00:57:46,557
Well, well, well.

1105
00:57:46,663 --> 00:57:49,223
How long you known
Mr. Otis, here?

1106
00:57:49,332 --> 00:57:50,492
(growls)

1107
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:52,261
Not so long, I guess.

1108
00:57:52,368 --> 00:57:55,360
So I reckon you
know Gertrude, too?

1109
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:57,872
Yes, I do.

1110
00:57:57,974 --> 00:57:59,703
Winn-Dixie!

1111
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:01,037
(barks)

1112
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:04,443
Yet somehow you don't
know Miss Gertrude.

1113
00:58:07,350 --> 00:58:08,874
Hmm?

1114
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:10,885
Nor why she'd
leave her shop

1115
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:13,217
in the hands of a drifter.

1116
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:15,416
Look, I told you
that we're cousins.

1117
00:58:15,525 --> 00:58:16,890
POLICEMAN:
You ain't no cousin

1118
00:58:16,993 --> 00:58:18,392
I know about, there, smiley.

1119
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:19,894
I told you her mama's sick,

1120
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:21,896
and I told you she asked me
to look after this store.

1121
00:58:21,998 --> 00:58:23,260
Well, aren't you

1122
00:58:23,366 --> 00:58:26,062
a big steamin'
pile of pancakes?

1123
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:27,693
OTIS: Don't you have
anyone else's day you can ruin?

1124
00:58:27,804 --> 00:58:28,828
Why'd you come
in here, man?

1125
00:58:28,938 --> 00:58:31,168
Just leave me alone. God.

1126
00:58:31,274 --> 00:58:33,265
Well, well, well.

1127
00:58:33,376 --> 00:58:36,937
Somebody's all fired
up on budgie food.

1128
00:58:37,046 --> 00:58:38,673
Now, you.

1129
00:58:38,781 --> 00:58:39,941
We're gonna go outside

1130
00:58:40,049 --> 00:58:41,744
and have a little talk,
me and you.

1131
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:43,785
Leave the girl alone.

1132
00:58:44,954 --> 00:58:48,446
Someone better shut
their gob-hole.

1133
00:58:48,558 --> 00:58:50,617
Come on, little one.

1134
00:58:50,727 --> 00:58:55,994
Get you out of the presence
of... Mr. Ravioli over here.

1135
00:58:58,101 --> 00:59:00,569
Come on.

1136
00:59:01,804 --> 00:59:02,828
Come on, now.

1137
00:59:05,408 --> 00:59:06,966
Now, you don't
know so much

1138
00:59:07,076 --> 00:59:08,976
about that fellow
in there, do you?

1139
00:59:09,078 --> 00:59:11,945
I know he can sing
near anything.

1140
00:59:12,048 --> 00:59:13,538
Oh, yeah, he can
sing, all right,

1141
00:59:13,650 --> 00:59:15,140
like a bird in a cage.

1142
00:59:15,251 --> 00:59:16,445
He tell you he
was locked up

1143
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:17,645
in jail for a while?

1144
00:59:17,754 --> 00:59:19,688
I don't know anything
about that.

1145
00:59:19,789 --> 00:59:22,155
POLICEMAN: Mm-hmm.
The preacher know you're working here?

1146
00:59:22,258 --> 00:59:23,316
(growls)

1147
00:59:23,426 --> 00:59:24,518
I didn't think so.

1148
00:59:24,627 --> 00:59:26,390
You just better
watch out.

1149
00:59:26,496 --> 00:59:29,363
Hey! Hey! Whoa!
Get away from there!

1150
00:59:29,465 --> 00:59:31,456
You are in violation

1151
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:33,001

1152
00:59:33,102 --> 00:59:34,797
The ramming of
a horny head

1153
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:37,031
into a police-issued vehicle!

1154
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:38,732
- (quacking)
- Ow!

1155
00:59:38,841 --> 00:59:40,206
Don't you sass me,

1156
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:41,504
you naughty goose!

1157
00:59:41,611 --> 00:59:43,238
- (shouts)

1158
00:59:43,346 --> 00:59:44,904
Hey, Elvis! You stupid...

1159
00:59:45,014 --> 00:59:46,208
Ow!

1160
00:59:46,316 --> 00:59:48,341
Just, oh, get out here
and help me!

1161
00:59:48,451 --> 00:59:49,884
Get away, you freak!

00:59:49,986 --> 00:59:52,511

00:59:52,622 --> 00:59:54,317

1164
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:58,952
Get away from me,

1166

1167
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:09,435
Crazy wild goose on me!

1168
01:00:09,539 --> 01:00:11,006
Oh! 10-59!

1169

Ah, I went through a stop sign!

01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:15,835

STEVI E:
You're such a goody-goody.

1174
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:22,346
Shouldn't the
preacher's daughter

1175
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:25,148
be at home
studying the Bible?

1176
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:35,526
I saw you with
the police.

1177
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:37,862
You're so busted.

1178
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:39,867
That pet shop man

1179
01:00:39,969 --> 01:00:42,369
is a retarded criminal.

1180
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:43,461
You don't know anything.

1181
01:00:43,573 --> 01:00:44,835
I know Preacher...

1182
01:00:44,941 --> 01:00:48,468
wouldn't like you hanging
around... with criminals.

1183
01:00:48,578 --> 01:00:50,102
Lay off her, Stevie.

1184
01:00:50,213 --> 01:00:51,976
I don't care what you guys say.

1185
01:00:52,081 --> 01:00:53,776

1186
01:00:53,883 --> 01:00:56,317
you booger-eaters!

1187

01:01:06,062 --> 01:01:08,530
Oh, stop that nonsense.

1192
01:01:08,631 --> 01:01:10,531
I do hate 'em.

1193
01:01:10,633 --> 01:01:12,794
They're ignorant.
They think you're a witch.

1194

Oh, they're just trying

1195
01:01:16,506 --> 01:01:18,497
I'll bet they like you.

Gloria, you know Otis?

1198
01:01:25,281 --> 01:01:27,112
No, I don't know Otis,

1199
01:01:27,216 --> 01:01:30,117
but I do know
what you told me about him.

1200
01:01:30,219 --> 01:01:31,413
You know he's a criminal?

1201
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:32,749
He's been in jail.

1202
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:34,618
Baby girl, come on.

1203
01:01:34,724 --> 01:01:36,624
I want to show
you somethin'.

1204
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:49,197
See this tree?

1205
01:01:49,305 --> 01:01:51,671
- Yeah.

01:01:59,749 --> 01:02:03,810
Ghosts of all the things
I've done wrong.

1210
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:06,480
You did
that many things wrong?

1211
01:02:06,589 --> 01:02:07,647
(chuckles)

1212
01:02:07,757 --> 01:02:09,816

01:02:11,227 --> 01:02:13,161
But you're not
a bad person.

1215
01:02:13,262 --> 01:02:16,561
Doesn't mean
I haven't done bad things.

1216
01:02:16,666 --> 01:02:19,134
But there's whiskey
bottles on there,

a-and beer bottles.

1218

That's right.
I know that.

I'm the one what drank
what was in 'em,

and I'm the one
what put 'em up there.

1221
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:34,140
Oh, baby girl.

1222
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:37,651
You know, a lot
of folks have problems...

1223
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:40,917
with liquor and beer.

1224
01:02:41,023 --> 01:02:45,392
Get to start drinkin'
and can't get stopped.

1225
01:02:45,495 --> 01:02:47,326
Are you one of those people?

1226
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:49,523
Yes, I am...

1227
01:02:49,632 --> 01:02:51,657
but you know somethin'?

1228
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:53,759
These days, I don't drink

1229
01:02:53,870 --> 01:02:55,997
nothin' stronger
than coffee.

1230
01:02:56,105 --> 01:02:58,505
Did the whiskey
and beer and wine...

1231
01:02:58,608 --> 01:03:01,975
did they make you do all those
bad things that are ghosts now?

1232
01:03:02,078 --> 01:03:03,204
Some of'em.

1233
01:03:03,312 --> 01:03:05,280
Some of'em
I would've done anyway,

1234
01:03:05,381 --> 01:03:09,044
with or without the liquor
and the beer...

1235
01:03:09,152 --> 01:03:12,019
till I learned.

1236
01:03:12,121 --> 01:03:14,681
Learned what?

1237
01:03:16,492 --> 01:03:19,620
Till I learned what was
the most important thing.

1238
01:03:19,729 --> 01:03:21,026
What's that?

1239
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:24,258
Oh... it's different
for everyone.

1240
01:03:24,367 --> 01:03:26,267
Got to learn
it on your own.

1241
01:03:27,370 --> 01:03:28,803
But, you know,

1242
01:03:28,905 --> 01:03:31,100
we should judge Otis

1243
01:03:31,207 --> 01:03:34,904
by the pretty music
that he makes

1244
01:03:35,011 --> 01:03:38,777
and how kind he is
to all them animals,

1245
01:03:38,881 --> 01:03:42,612
'cause that's all we know
about him now... right?

1246
01:03:42,718 --> 01:03:44,879
Yes, ma'am.

All right, then.

1249
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:06,907
(bottles clanking)

1250
01:04:16,018 --> 01:04:19,317
Miss Franny, I've got this
friend named Gloria Dump...

1251
01:04:19,422 --> 01:04:21,413
- Mm.
...and she really loves to read,

1252
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:25,722
only her eyes are bad,
so she can't read anymore.

1253
01:04:25,828 --> 01:04:26,954
- Ooh.
- So I was thinkin'

1254
01:04:27,063 --> 01:04:28,553
maybe I could read her
a story.

1255
01:04:28,664 --> 01:04:30,632
- Mm.
- Do you have any suggestions?

1256
01:04:30,733 --> 01:04:32,963
Of course I have
suggestions.

1257
01:04:33,069 --> 01:04:37,301
Hmm. What about...
Gone with the Wind?

1258
01:04:37,406 --> 01:04:38,373
What's that about?

1259
01:04:38,474 --> 01:04:40,465
Oh, it's a wonderful,
exciting story

1260
01:04:40,576 --> 01:04:42,134
about the Civil War.

1261
01:04:42,245 --> 01:04:43,678
The Civil War?

1262
01:04:43,779 --> 01:04:45,474
Now, Opal,
don't tell me

1263
01:04:45,581 --> 01:04:47,481
you have never heard
of the Civil War.

1264
01:04:47,583 --> 01:04:49,574
It was the war
between the North

1265
01:04:49,685 --> 01:04:51,312
and the South
over slavery.

1266
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:52,853
MISS FRANNY:
That's right, Opal.

1267
01:04:52,955 --> 01:04:55,287
My great-grandfather,
Littmus W. Block,

1268
01:04:55,391 --> 01:04:57,450
fought in that war.

1269
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:59,824
I'm ready for another book.

1270
01:04:59,929 --> 01:05:02,329
Well, Amanda, maybe you
wouldn't mind waitin'.

1271
01:05:02,431 --> 01:05:04,331
I was just telling
India Opal a story

1272
01:05:04,433 --> 01:05:06,128
about my great-grandfather.

1273
01:05:06,235 --> 01:05:07,634
I sure would like
to hear a story

1274
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:09,796
about your great-grandfather.

1275
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:14,036
MISS FRANNY:
Now, Littmus, only a boy of 14,

1276
01:05:14,143 --> 01:05:15,804
went off to be a hero,

1277
01:05:15,912 --> 01:05:18,210
but he soon found out
the truth.

1278
01:05:18,314 --> 01:05:19,281
What truth?

1279
01:05:19,382 --> 01:05:22,249
That war is hell.
Pure hell.

1280
01:05:22,351 --> 01:05:24,114
"Hell" is a cuss word.

1281
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:26,154
MISS FRANNY:
Well, "war" is a cuss word, too.

1282
01:05:26,255 --> 01:05:28,416
I mean, nei-neither
of you can imagine...

1283
01:05:28,524 --> 01:05:30,492
Littmus was hungry
all the time.

1284
01:05:30,593 --> 01:05:33,323
He was covered
with all manner of vermin.

1285
01:05:33,429 --> 01:05:35,090
Fleas and lice.

1286
01:05:35,197 --> 01:05:36,994
And he was constantly
being shot at.

1287
01:05:37,099 --> 01:05:40,660
He suffered in a way that no boy
should ever have to suffer,

1288
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:42,362
and it changed him.

1289
01:05:42,471 --> 01:05:44,439
(grunting)

1290
01:05:44,540 --> 01:05:47,065
(whispering):
Shoot, I can't see nothin'.

1291
01:05:47,176 --> 01:05:48,905
(grunting)

1292
01:05:49,011 --> 01:05:51,571
There probably
ain't nothin' to see.

1293
01:05:51,681 --> 01:05:53,012
Come on, Dunlap.

1294
01:05:53,115 --> 01:05:55,913
You got to think
like a secret agent.

1295
01:05:56,018 --> 01:05:57,849
You got to think
like a spy.

1296
01:05:57,954 --> 01:06:00,616
He walked back home
when the war was over.

1297
01:06:00,723 --> 01:06:04,124
I mean, he walked from Virginia
all the way to Georgia,

1298
01:06:04,226 --> 01:06:07,457
but when he got there,
his parents, his sisters,

1299
01:06:07,563 --> 01:06:09,758
everything
and everyone was gone.

1300
01:06:09,865 --> 01:06:12,390
AMANDA: But, Miss Franny,
what about his sisters?

1301
01:06:12,501 --> 01:06:14,469
- What happened to them?
- Dead.

1302
01:06:14,570 --> 01:06:16,538
Dead from typhoid fever.

1303
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:18,436
And his mama?

1304
01:06:18,541 --> 01:06:19,599
Dead, too.

1305
01:06:19,709 --> 01:06:21,802
And his father?

1306
01:06:21,911 --> 01:06:23,173
(sighs)

1307
01:06:23,279 --> 01:06:24,974
He died on the battlefield.

1308
01:06:25,081 --> 01:06:27,015
People are dying
all over the place.

1309
01:06:27,116 --> 01:06:28,583
This guy's whole family's dead!

1310
01:06:28,684 --> 01:06:30,276
STEVI E:
Come on, I wanna hear.

1311
01:06:30,386 --> 01:06:32,650
So, Littmus was
an orphan?

1312
01:06:32,755 --> 01:06:36,247
Yes. Poor Littmus was
all alone in the world.

1313
01:06:36,359 --> 01:06:37,656
(whimpers)

1314
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:39,352
(clears throat)

1315
01:06:39,462 --> 01:06:41,157
Well...

1316
01:06:41,263 --> 01:06:44,494
when he finished crying, he...

1317
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:48,400
had the s-strangest sensation.

1318
01:06:48,504 --> 01:06:50,301
He wanted something sweet.

1319
01:06:50,406 --> 01:06:53,102
He wanted
a piece of candy.

1320
01:06:53,209 --> 01:06:55,905
Yes, ma'am.
Littmus W. Block figured

1321
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:59,038
that the world
was a sorry affair

1322
01:06:59,148 --> 01:07:02,117
and had enough ugly things in it.

1323
01:07:02,218 --> 01:07:07,622
And what he was going to do
was put something sweet in it.

1324
01:07:07,723 --> 01:07:09,315
STEVI E:
Let me see.

1325
01:07:09,425 --> 01:07:10,517
(gasping)

1326
01:07:10,626 --> 01:07:12,560
(grunting)

1327
01:07:13,963 --> 01:07:15,487
- Quiet!
- (Stevie groans)

1328
01:07:15,598 --> 01:07:18,726
Would you care
for a Littmus lozenge?

1329
01:07:18,834 --> 01:07:19,994
- Yes, Miss...
- Yes, please.

1330
01:07:20,102 --> 01:07:21,899
Thank you.

1331
01:07:22,004 --> 01:07:23,801
Now, they're
not made anymore.

1332
01:07:23,906 --> 01:07:25,134
The world, it seems,

1333
01:07:25,241 --> 01:07:27,641
lost its appetite
for Littmus lozenges.

1334
01:07:27,743 --> 01:07:29,711
Fortunately,
I had the foresight

1335
01:07:29,812 --> 01:07:32,007
to save a few.

1336
01:07:36,819 --> 01:07:38,650
Do you like it?

1337
01:07:38,754 --> 01:07:40,915
OPAL:
Yes, ma'am.

1338
01:07:41,023 --> 01:07:42,615
What about you, Amanda?

1339
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:46,684
Yes, ma'am, but it
makes me feel sad.

1340
01:07:46,796 --> 01:07:50,732
There is a secret
ingredient in there.

1341
01:07:50,833 --> 01:07:52,198
What is it?

1342
01:07:53,436 --> 01:07:55,734
(whispers):
Sorrow.

1343
01:07:55,838 --> 01:07:57,999
Not everybody can taste it.

1344
01:07:58,107 --> 01:07:59,904
I taste it.

1345
01:08:00,009 --> 01:08:01,203
Me, too.

1346
01:08:01,310 --> 01:08:03,369
Well, then...

1347
01:08:03,479 --> 01:08:07,245
you've probably both had
your share of sadness.

1348
01:08:07,349 --> 01:08:09,544
The world has changed so much.

1349
01:08:09,652 --> 01:08:12,849
People in Naomi, they-they used
to know each other's sadnesses.

1350
01:08:12,955 --> 01:08:14,820
They used to rely on each other.

1351
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:18,519
This town just isn't the same
without the candy factory.

1352
01:08:20,429 --> 01:08:23,262
But how do you get sadness
into a piece of candy?

1353
01:08:23,365 --> 01:08:25,560
Yeah, how'd you get
that taste in there?

1354
01:08:25,668 --> 01:08:28,933
That is the mystery.

1355
01:08:29,038 --> 01:08:32,599
That's how Littmus made
his fortune.

1356
01:08:32,708 --> 01:08:34,471
By manufacturing a candy

1357
01:08:34,577 --> 01:08:38,069
that tasted sweet and sad
at the same time.

1358
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:43,013
Man, we missed out
on the candy.

1359
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:45,087
Now they're just
sitting around,

1360
01:08:45,187 --> 01:08:47,485
talking about
how they feel.

1361
01:08:47,590 --> 01:08:49,319
(mutters):
Come on.

1362
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:04,599
I had to move away
from Watley...

1363
01:09:04,707 --> 01:09:07,198
and leave all
my friends behind.

1364
01:09:07,309 --> 01:09:10,972
That's one sadness
I've known.

1365
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:13,514
And my mama.

1366
01:09:13,616 --> 01:09:15,641
I don't know my mama.

1367
01:09:15,751 --> 01:09:16,843
(sniffles)

1368
01:09:16,952 --> 01:09:19,079
I only know a few
things about her.

1369
01:09:19,188 --> 01:09:21,588
And there's something the
preacher won't tell me.

1370
01:09:21,690 --> 01:09:23,920
(voice breaking):
It makes me think of Carson.

1371
01:09:24,026 --> 01:09:24,993
(sniffles)

1372
01:09:25,094 --> 01:09:26,083
STEVI E:
Hey, guys.

1373
01:09:26,195 --> 01:09:28,925
Bookworms!
Where's your apples?

1374
01:09:29,031 --> 01:09:31,261
I have to go.
(sighs)

1375
01:09:33,035 --> 01:09:34,866
STEVI E:
What's with her?

1376
01:09:34,970 --> 01:09:35,959
Who's Carson?

1377
01:09:36,071 --> 01:09:39,598
Carson was
Amanda's brother.

1378
01:09:39,708 --> 01:09:41,335
Was?

1379
01:09:41,443 --> 01:09:43,809
He drowned last year.

1380
01:09:43,913 --> 01:09:46,211
I saw the whole thing.

1381
01:09:46,315 --> 01:09:47,907
Come on, Dunlap.

1382
01:09:48,017 --> 01:09:49,780
(grunts)

1383
01:10:01,564 --> 01:10:05,864
OPAL: Gloria said that Naomi
was like one big mistake tree.

1384
01:10:05,968 --> 01:10:08,436
And every person
was its own bottle,

1385
01:10:08,537 --> 01:10:11,131
hanging in the wind,
all empty and alone.

1386
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:14,266
Miss Franny thought
it had been that way

1387
01:10:14,376 --> 01:10:18,142
ever since the candy factory
closed years ago.

1388
01:10:18,247 --> 01:10:21,011
People lost more
than their jobs.

1389
01:10:21,116 --> 01:10:23,448
They lost each other.

1390
01:10:27,289 --> 01:10:28,722
(crunching)

1391
01:10:28,824 --> 01:10:30,917
Tastes like music.

1392
01:10:35,164 --> 01:10:36,290
(smacks lips)

1393
01:10:40,202 --> 01:10:43,296
It reminds me of, uh...

1394
01:10:43,405 --> 01:10:45,771
being in jail.

1395
01:10:47,843 --> 01:10:50,835
Otis, what were you in jail for?

1396
01:10:52,014 --> 01:10:52,981
(grunts)

1397
01:10:53,082 --> 01:10:54,049
(plucks guitar note)

1398
01:10:54,149 --> 01:10:56,083
You don't have to tell me.

1399
01:10:56,185 --> 01:10:57,675
I was just wondering.

1400
01:10:57,786 --> 01:10:59,219
(strums guitar chord)

1401
01:10:59,321 --> 01:11:00,515
I never hurt anybody.

1402
01:11:00,623 --> 01:11:02,215
(picking gentle melody)

1403
01:11:02,324 --> 01:11:04,087
Never meant to.

1404
01:11:04,193 --> 01:11:06,661
But I've been locked up.

1405
01:11:08,397 --> 01:11:10,661
And I remember the day
very well.

1406
01:11:10,766 --> 01:11:12,495
I was sitting
in the park,

1407
01:11:12,601 --> 01:11:14,125
playing a little music.

1408
01:11:14,236 --> 01:11:17,103
And there were people
walking their dogs,

1409
01:11:17,206 --> 01:11:19,106
and children
were laughing.

1410
01:11:19,208 --> 01:11:22,609
It was a perfect day, so I...

1411
01:11:22,711 --> 01:11:24,702
felt like playing music.

1412
01:11:24,813 --> 01:11:26,474
(strumming chords)

1413
01:11:26,582 --> 01:11:27,708
I put my...

1414
01:11:27,816 --> 01:11:29,306
I put my hat out there,

1415
01:11:29,418 --> 01:11:31,943
but I wasn't really playing
for money.

1416
01:11:32,054 --> 01:11:35,751
I just thought that maybe
if someone was enjoying it,

1417
01:11:35,858 --> 01:11:38,691
they might throw
a little change in there.

1418
01:11:38,794 --> 01:11:40,489
(strumming steadily)

1419
01:11:40,596 --> 01:11:42,359
Or not. I just...

1420
01:11:42,464 --> 01:11:45,797
Well, music is better
if somebody's listening.

1421
01:11:45,901 --> 01:11:47,698
Anyway, this...

1422
01:11:47,803 --> 01:11:49,737
(steady strumming)

1423
01:11:49,838 --> 01:11:51,965
...this policeman
came up to me.

1424
01:11:52,074 --> 01:11:55,168
He said I was disturbing
the peace.

1425
01:11:55,277 --> 01:11:58,246
And then he tried to take
my guitar away from me.

1426
01:11:58,347 --> 01:12:00,645
And I guess I got
real angry at him.

1427
01:12:00,749 --> 01:12:03,741
(strumming resumes)

1428
01:12:03,852 --> 01:12:06,582
But I'm not a bad man.

1429
01:12:08,657 --> 01:12:09,988
I'm just...

1430
01:12:10,092 --> 01:12:11,957
[music] Not a lucky man [music]

1431
01:12:12,061 --> 01:12:14,825
(strumming steadily)

1432
01:12:17,032 --> 01:12:20,001
Anyway, they told me that I
broke that policeman's nose.

1433
01:12:20,102 --> 01:12:22,070
(strumming continues)

1434
01:12:23,906 --> 01:12:27,569
And they charged me with
assault on a police officer.

1435
01:12:27,676 --> 01:12:31,203
And no matter what I said,
they wouldn't listen.

1436
01:12:31,313 --> 01:12:34,282
No matter what I said,
they wouldn't...

1437
01:12:34,383 --> 01:12:37,443
They gave me
three years.

1438
01:12:37,553 --> 01:12:39,248
I said I'm...

1439
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:41,323
not a bad man; I'm just...

1440
01:12:41,423 --> 01:12:43,118
(strumming continues)

1441
01:12:43,225 --> 01:12:45,955
[Music] Not a lucky man... [music]

1442
01:12:49,565 --> 01:12:53,331
But you. When I...
when I look at you...

1443
01:12:53,435 --> 01:12:55,232
(strumming continues)

1444
01:12:55,337 --> 01:12:58,329
[Music] You are like a butterfly [music]

1445
01:13:01,143 --> 01:13:04,670
[Music] A caterpillar's dream to fly [music]

1446
01:13:07,015 --> 01:13:11,076
[Music] To bust out
of this old cocoon [music]

1447
01:13:13,422 --> 01:13:17,256
[Music] And dry your wings off [music]

1448
01:13:18,594 --> 01:13:22,121
[Music] Butterfly [music]

1449
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:26,793
[Music] Go ahead and fly... [music]

1450
01:13:29,738 --> 01:13:33,196
(guitar strumming continues)

1451
01:13:33,308 --> 01:13:37,142
OPAL:
I swept the floor real slow that day.

1452
01:13:37,246 --> 01:13:39,908
I wanted to keep Otis company.

1453
01:13:40,015 --> 01:13:42,711
I didn't want him to be lonely.

1454
01:13:42,818 --> 01:13:45,048
Sometimes it seemed to me

1455
01:13:45,154 --> 01:13:48,282
like everybody
in the whole world was lonely.

1456
01:13:50,726 --> 01:13:51,852
Yuck.

1457
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:55,293
That tastes bad.

1458
01:13:55,397 --> 01:13:58,662
That tastes like
not having a dog.

1459
01:13:58,767 --> 01:14:01,463
OPAL:
I wondered if my mama...

1460
01:14:01,570 --> 01:14:05,700
wherever she was...
was lonely for me.

1461
01:14:05,808 --> 01:14:07,332
Thinking about her was the same

1462
01:14:07,443 --> 01:14:09,934
as the hole you keep on feeling
with your tongue

1463
01:14:10,045 --> 01:14:12,036
after you lose a tooth.

1464
01:14:12,147 --> 01:14:16,982
Time after time, my mind kept
on going to that empty spot.

1465
01:14:17,085 --> 01:14:20,646
The spot where I felt
like she should be.

1466
01:14:22,891 --> 01:14:24,222
Ooh, here, here!

1467
01:14:24,326 --> 01:14:26,123
(grunting)

1468
01:14:26,228 --> 01:14:27,593
BOY:
Get back in your spots.

1469
01:14:27,696 --> 01:14:28,890
BOY 2:
Okay.

1470
01:14:28,997 --> 01:14:31,727
STEVI E:
Strike one.

1471
01:14:31,834 --> 01:14:33,529
What do you think?

1472
01:14:33,635 --> 01:14:35,193
Shall we give some
to the boys?

1473
01:14:35,304 --> 01:14:36,293
(whines)

1474
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:38,497
(sighs)

1475
01:14:38,607 --> 01:14:40,768
Yeah, but they haven't been
very nice.

1476
01:14:40,876 --> 01:14:43,310
They never want to play with us.

1477
01:14:43,412 --> 01:14:45,403
Try this one, Dunlap.

1478
01:14:46,915 --> 01:14:48,712
(boys shouting)

1479
01:14:48,817 --> 01:14:49,715
(barks)

1480
01:14:49,818 --> 01:14:51,046
Winn-Dixie!

1481
01:14:51,153 --> 01:14:53,121
I got it! I got it!

1482
01:14:55,757 --> 01:14:57,122
I got it!

1483
01:14:57,226 --> 01:14:58,659
I got it!

1484
01:15:00,062 --> 01:15:01,051
Whoa!

1485
01:15:01,163 --> 01:15:03,154
There he is! Get him!

1486
01:15:03,265 --> 01:15:05,256
(boys shouting)

1487
01:15:05,367 --> 01:15:06,732
BOY:
Just get him!

1488
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:12,602
Get the ball!

1489
01:15:12,708 --> 01:15:14,733
(growling)

1490
01:15:14,843 --> 01:15:16,310
Help me! Help me, Dunlap!

1491
01:15:22,584 --> 01:15:24,245
BOY:
Here comes the sheriff.

1492
01:15:24,353 --> 01:15:28,790
What in the name of corn on
the cob is goin' on around here?

1493
01:15:28,891 --> 01:15:31,416
Have we got
a situation here, fellas?

1494
01:15:31,527 --> 01:15:33,757
No, sir.
They're just all playin'.

1495
01:15:33,862 --> 01:15:34,794
(boys laughing)

1496
01:15:34,897 --> 01:15:37,457
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Keep away from me!

1497
01:15:37,566 --> 01:15:38,362
(barks)

1498
01:15:39,368 --> 01:15:41,131
(shouts)

1499
01:15:41,236 --> 01:15:42,794
Oh!

1500
01:15:42,905 --> 01:15:43,872
Get off of me!

1501
01:15:43,972 --> 01:15:45,030
- Off!
- (fabric tearing)

1502
01:15:45,140 --> 01:15:47,973
Get off of me, you hairy,
heavy-metal hound dog!

1503
01:15:48,076 --> 01:15:50,442
Ow! Give me my pants back!

1504
01:15:50,546 --> 01:15:52,377
Oh! That's a wedgie!

1505
01:15:52,481 --> 01:15:54,005
(shouts)

1506
01:15:54,116 --> 01:15:56,141
(screams)

1507
01:15:56,251 --> 01:15:58,811
This whole town's
gone mad!

1508
01:15:58,921 --> 01:16:00,821
(boys laughing)

1509
01:16:00,923 --> 01:16:02,220
Look, he has chicken legs!

1510
01:16:02,324 --> 01:16:03,985
I suppose you think
this is funny?

1511
01:16:04,092 --> 01:16:06,560
(laughter)

1512
01:16:07,763 --> 01:16:09,856
(shrieks)

1513
01:16:09,965 --> 01:16:12,229
Don't look at that!

1514
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:16,231
(laughs):
He wasn't trying to hurt you.

1515
01:16:16,338 --> 01:16:18,670
He just wanted
to give you a candy.

1516
01:16:18,774 --> 01:16:20,366
(laughing)

1517
01:16:20,475 --> 01:16:22,409
You little sea-monkeys.

1518
01:16:22,511 --> 01:16:24,979
But I'm gonna see you
in sea-monkey jail.

1519
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:26,809
(engine revving)

1520
01:16:26,915 --> 01:16:28,974
I better put it in drive.

1521
01:16:29,084 --> 01:16:31,712
(shouts)

1522
01:16:31,820 --> 01:16:33,515
(barks)

1523
01:16:43,832 --> 01:16:45,595
(sighs)

1524
01:16:45,701 --> 01:16:47,965
(song on radio)

1525
01:16:51,206 --> 01:16:53,538
(whining)

1526
01:16:53,642 --> 01:16:55,405
What's wrong?

1527
01:16:55,510 --> 01:16:57,068
You all right?

1528
01:16:57,179 --> 01:16:59,340
(whimpering)

1529
01:17:02,484 --> 01:17:04,247
(whispering):
Oh, Winn-Dixie!

1530
01:17:04,353 --> 01:17:07,015
How many did you eat of these?

1531
01:17:07,122 --> 01:17:08,111
(belches)

1532
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:11,215
(whispering):
Oh! Oh, that's gross!

1533
01:17:11,326 --> 01:17:14,784
(belching loudly)

1534
01:17:14,896 --> 01:17:16,090
Oh, Winn-Dixie, ew!

1535
01:17:16,198 --> 01:17:17,756
PREACHER:
Opal, I hope you don't have

1536
01:17:17,866 --> 01:17:19,595
that dog in your bed.

1537
01:17:22,004 --> 01:17:24,973
(song continues)

1538
01:17:43,825 --> 01:17:45,793
(song ends)

1539
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:52,931
Daddy?

1540
01:17:53,035 --> 01:17:54,400
Opal...

1541
01:17:54,503 --> 01:17:55,765
it's 2:00 in the morning.

1542
01:17:55,871 --> 01:17:57,668
What are you doing up?

1543
01:18:02,377 --> 01:18:04,811
Daddy, are you hungry?

1544
01:18:04,913 --> 01:18:07,006
You lookin'
for somethin' to eat?

1545
01:18:07,115 --> 01:18:09,106
Yeah, that's it.
I'm hungry.

1546
01:18:09,217 --> 01:18:10,184
(sniffles)

1547
01:18:10,285 --> 01:18:11,252
(sighs)

1548
01:18:15,924 --> 01:18:18,791
Try this.

1549
01:18:19,928 --> 01:18:21,657
What's this?

1550
01:18:21,763 --> 01:18:24,163
A Littmus lozenge.

1551
01:18:35,944 --> 01:18:37,707
Do you like it?

1552
01:18:37,813 --> 01:18:39,678
(scoffs)

1553
01:18:39,781 --> 01:18:43,012
Candy tastes melancholy.

1554
01:18:44,086 --> 01:18:45,678
What's melancholy?

1555
01:18:45,787 --> 01:18:48,312
Sad.

1556
01:18:48,423 --> 01:18:50,914
It's supposed to taste sad.

1557
01:18:51,026 --> 01:18:53,893
Makes me think
of your mother.

1558
01:18:53,995 --> 01:18:55,986
Do you think
about her a lot?

1559
01:18:57,199 --> 01:19:00,225
I do, Opal.

1560
01:19:00,335 --> 01:19:01,302
Daddy...

1561
01:19:01,403 --> 01:19:03,462
did she drink?

1562
01:19:03,572 --> 01:19:04,732
Opal, there's some things

1563
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:07,035
you're just too
young to understand.

1564
01:19:07,142 --> 01:19:11,340
L-I understand a lot of things.

1565
01:19:11,446 --> 01:19:14,506
I know about people
with drinkin' problems.

1566
01:19:14,616 --> 01:19:15,605
(sighs)

1567
01:19:15,717 --> 01:19:19,244
Gloria Dump had
a drinking problem.

1568
01:19:19,354 --> 01:19:22,653
(whispering):
I want to understand.

1569
01:19:22,758 --> 01:19:24,623
Yeah, I don't
even understand

1570
01:19:24,726 --> 01:19:26,694
what happened
with your mama.

1571
01:19:29,698 --> 01:19:31,393
We were happy,
I know that,

1572
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:33,024
for a long time.

1573
01:19:35,370 --> 01:19:38,828
Well, it seemed like a
long time, we were happy.

1574
01:19:40,709 --> 01:19:43,735
But then she
started drinkin'.

1575
01:19:43,845 --> 01:19:46,837
She started drinkin'...

1576
01:19:46,948 --> 01:19:48,939
and that's the tenth thing?

1577
01:19:52,020 --> 01:19:55,114
But it's more
complicated than that.

1578
01:19:56,558 --> 01:19:59,118
Did she drink
because I was bad?

1579
01:19:59,227 --> 01:20:01,354
Was it my fault
that she left?

1580
01:20:01,463 --> 01:20:02,794
No. No! No!

1581
01:20:02,898 --> 01:20:03,922
It's not your fault.

1582
01:20:04,032 --> 01:20:07,490
Don't... don't ever
say it's your fault.

1583
01:20:09,571 --> 01:20:11,630
(whispering):
Don't ever say that.

1584
01:20:13,341 --> 01:20:15,275
Do you hear me?

1585
01:20:15,377 --> 01:20:17,470
Yes, sir.

1586
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:28,979
OPAL: I thought about how life
was like a Littmus lozenge,

1587
01:20:29,090 --> 01:20:32,992
how the sweet and the sad
were all mixed up together...

1588
01:20:33,094 --> 01:20:37,758
and how hard it was
to separate them out.

1589
01:20:37,866 --> 01:20:40,061
(whines)

1590
01:21:03,091 --> 01:21:04,786
He was so angry.

1591
01:21:04,893 --> 01:21:06,554
Well...

1592
01:21:06,661 --> 01:21:09,459
He was hurtin',
that's why.

1593
01:21:09,564 --> 01:21:11,623
Everybody's hurtin'.

1594
01:21:11,733 --> 01:21:14,167
Makes me feel sad.

1595
01:21:14,269 --> 01:21:20,833
I want to help 'em, but I
just don't know what to do.

1596
01:21:20,942 --> 01:21:25,675
Well... don't dwell
on it, child.

1597
01:21:28,149 --> 01:21:32,347
Why don't we see what Miss
Scarlett's doin', hmm?

1598
01:21:32,454 --> 01:21:35,981
I believe she's gettin'
ready for that party.

1599
01:21:37,726 --> 01:21:40,126
That's what we need to do!

1600
01:21:43,465 --> 01:21:45,023
"We" who?

1601
01:21:45,133 --> 01:21:46,532
We... me and you!

1602
01:21:46,635 --> 01:21:47,897
We should have a party!

1603
01:21:48,003 --> 01:21:50,528
Don't you think we should have
a party, Winn-Dixie?

1604
01:21:50,639 --> 01:21:51,663
(groans)

1605
01:21:51,773 --> 01:21:53,536
We can invite
Miss Franny Block...

1606
01:21:53,642 --> 01:21:55,109
- No, Opal!
...and the preacher and Otis.

1607
01:21:55,210 --> 01:21:56,199
Opal, don't go
in there!

1608
01:21:56,311 --> 01:21:58,108
Come on, we need
to start plannin'.

1609
01:21:58,213 --> 01:21:59,237
GLORIA:
No!

1610
01:21:59,347 --> 01:22:01,907
Wow, it's dark in here.

1611
01:22:02,017 --> 01:22:03,917
GLORIA:
Hold on, now, hon...

1612
01:22:04,019 --> 01:22:05,919
Opal?

1613
01:22:06,021 --> 01:22:08,683
Opal, wh-where are you?

1614
01:22:08,790 --> 01:22:09,779
Do you see?

1615
01:22:09,891 --> 01:22:11,290
- Don't, don't...
- That's a lot better.

1616
01:22:11,393 --> 01:22:12,360
Close those cur...

1617
01:22:12,460 --> 01:22:13,427
(sighs)

1618
01:22:13,528 --> 01:22:15,052
- Come on.
- Stop it!

1619
01:22:15,163 --> 01:22:17,222
You cannot have
any party here!

1620
01:22:17,332 --> 01:22:19,562
I haven't had folks
in here for years.

1621
01:22:20,702 --> 01:22:22,533
Just make sandwiches.

1622
01:22:22,637 --> 01:22:24,730
And Otis can bring
his guitar.

1623
01:22:24,839 --> 01:22:27,774
I said no, and that's
the end of it.

1624
01:22:27,876 --> 01:22:29,673
(whines)

1625
01:22:29,778 --> 01:22:31,746
Miss Franny said the problem
with people here

1626
01:22:31,846 --> 01:22:34,610
is that they forgot
how to share their sadness,

1627
01:22:34,716 --> 01:22:38,777
but what I think is that people
forgot how to share their joy.

1628
01:22:40,021 --> 01:22:45,084
Oh, Winn-Dixie, oh...

1629
01:22:45,193 --> 01:22:48,594
Gloria, we need this party.

1630
01:22:48,697 --> 01:22:51,131
(whines and barks)

1631
01:22:51,232 --> 01:22:53,223
(whispering):
Please?

1632
01:22:53,335 --> 01:22:55,735
Oh, Lord.

1633
01:22:56,805 --> 01:22:59,933
(sighs):
This child.

1634
01:23:02,577 --> 01:23:06,240
Well, if we're
gonna have a party...

1635
01:23:07,349 --> 01:23:10,216
this house needs
a big pick up

1636
01:23:10,318 --> 01:23:12,786
if we gonna have folks over.

1637
01:23:12,887 --> 01:23:14,650
Whee! We're having a party!

1638
01:23:14,756 --> 01:23:16,018
We're gonna have a party,

1639
01:23:16,124 --> 01:23:20,390
and don't you forget to
invite them Dewberry boys.

1640
01:23:21,863 --> 01:23:25,128
(singing)

1641
01:23:26,234 --> 01:23:28,327
Thank you, Opal!

1642
01:23:37,545 --> 01:23:38,534
Thanks.

1643
01:23:38,646 --> 01:23:40,807
You're welcome.

1644
01:23:40,915 --> 01:23:44,544
(singing continues)

1645
01:23:49,090 --> 01:23:50,284
GLORIA:
Fruit.

1646
01:23:50,392 --> 01:23:52,690
Oh!

1647
01:24:07,242 --> 01:24:08,709
(laughs)

1648
01:24:08,810 --> 01:24:10,300
Winn-Dixie!

1649
01:24:10,412 --> 01:24:12,505
(growls)

1650
01:24:12,614 --> 01:24:14,582
(singing ends)

1651
01:24:20,422 --> 01:24:21,946
You're gonna come, right?

1652
01:24:22,057 --> 01:24:25,220
Yeah, l-I'll be there.

1653
01:24:25,326 --> 01:24:28,523
Should be done with
prayer group by then.

1654
01:24:30,532 --> 01:24:33,660
We're havin' a party,
and you're invited.

1655
01:24:41,576 --> 01:24:45,910
You don't have to thank me.
It was Winn-Dixie's idea.

1656
01:24:49,250 --> 01:24:51,411
Come on, Winn-Dixie.

1657
01:24:51,519 --> 01:24:53,043
Come on.

1658
01:24:57,192 --> 01:24:58,819
MR. ALFRED:
Little miss?

1659
01:24:58,927 --> 01:25:01,657
He don't howl so much anymore.

1660
01:25:01,763 --> 01:25:04,891
He's not so lonely anymore.

1661
01:25:10,538 --> 01:25:12,972
Come on.

1662
01:25:17,912 --> 01:25:20,107
Mr. Alfred, you're one
of the first people here.

1663
01:25:20,215 --> 01:25:22,410
Well, there's no sense in
dilly-dallying, you know?

1664
01:25:22,517 --> 01:25:23,484
Hello, Opal.

1665
01:25:23,585 --> 01:25:24,643
Hi, Miss Franny.

1666
01:25:24,752 --> 01:25:27,084
Mr. Alfred,
do you know Miss Franny?

1667
01:25:27,188 --> 01:25:28,212
No.

1668
01:25:28,323 --> 01:25:30,086
Miss Franny. Hello.

1669
01:25:30,191 --> 01:25:32,751
Nice to meet you.

1670
01:25:34,362 --> 01:25:37,627
I brung dog pictures
for the theme of the party.

1671
01:25:37,732 --> 01:25:39,962
Oh! That's great,
Sweetie Pie.

1672
01:25:40,068 --> 01:25:41,626
Let me show you.

1673
01:25:42,670 --> 01:25:45,298
Come on, Winn-Dixie.

1674
01:25:45,406 --> 01:25:47,966
Oh, wow,
they're beautiful!

1675
01:25:48,076 --> 01:25:49,270
AMANDA:
Hey, Opal.

1676
01:25:49,377 --> 01:25:51,242
Oh, hey, Amanda!

1677
01:25:51,346 --> 01:25:53,644
I'm so glad you could come.

1678
01:25:53,748 --> 01:25:55,409
Thank you for
inviting me.

1679
01:25:55,517 --> 01:25:56,643
Oh, thanks for comin'.

1680
01:25:56,751 --> 01:25:58,184
- Hey, Winn-Dixie.
- Hold on.

1681
01:25:58,286 --> 01:25:59,344
Okay.

1682
01:25:59,454 --> 01:26:00,478
Gloria!

1683
01:26:00,588 --> 01:26:03,648
Gloria! Gloria.

1684
01:26:03,758 --> 01:26:06,989
GLORIA:
I'm comin', I'm comin'.

1685
01:26:07,095 --> 01:26:09,495
I'm comin', baby girl.
Don't rush me.

1686
01:26:09,597 --> 01:26:11,861
Please don't rush me.
I'm so nervous.

1687
01:26:11,966 --> 01:26:15,129
I haven't done this
in such a long time.

1688
01:26:15,236 --> 01:26:18,637
It's okay.
You look beautiful.

1689
01:26:18,740 --> 01:26:22,073
Well, thank you for my
hair and my fingernails.

1690
01:26:22,177 --> 01:26:23,474
And you look pretty, too.

1691
01:26:23,578 --> 01:26:25,136
You wearin' that
necklace I gave you?

1692
01:26:25,246 --> 01:26:26,235
Mm-hmm.

1693
01:26:26,347 --> 01:26:28,679
Oh, everything is
so beautiful, Opal.

1694
01:26:28,783 --> 01:26:32,150
I can see it.
I can just see it.

1695
01:26:32,253 --> 01:26:33,220
Hi, Gloria.

1696
01:26:33,321 --> 01:26:34,515
Who's that?

1697
01:26:34,622 --> 01:26:38,422
Oh, Gloria, I'd like you
to meet my new friend, Amanda.

1698
01:26:38,526 --> 01:26:40,756
Amanda.
What a beautiful name.

1699
01:26:40,862 --> 01:26:42,193
- I'm glad you came.
- Thank you.

1700
01:26:42,297 --> 01:26:44,356
- Come on.
- Me, too.

1701
01:26:44,465 --> 01:26:47,195
Come on. And this is
Miss Franny Block.

1702
01:26:47,302 --> 01:26:49,361
Hello, Gloria.
I've heard all about you.

1703
01:26:49,470 --> 01:26:51,301
I hope you're enjoying
Gone with the Wind.

1704
01:26:51,406 --> 01:26:53,135
(gasps):
Oh... thank you.

1705
01:26:53,241 --> 01:26:55,038
- You're welcome.
- And that's Mr. Alfred.

1706
01:26:55,143 --> 01:26:57,202
Miss Gloria,
I'm delighted to meet you.

1707
01:26:57,312 --> 01:26:59,041
GERTRUDE:
Gertrude's a pretty bird.

1708
01:26:59,147 --> 01:27:01,138
MR. ALFRED:
I had no idea all this was back here.

1709
01:27:01,249 --> 01:27:02,546
- Hello.
- Hey, Otis!

1710
01:27:02,650 --> 01:27:04,641
Otis. Uh-oh.

1711
01:27:04,752 --> 01:27:06,049
Uh-oh, uh-oh.

1712
01:27:06,154 --> 01:27:08,213
It's all right.
It's just a few people.

1713
01:27:08,323 --> 01:27:09,984
Hardly any people at all.

1714
01:27:10,091 --> 01:27:11,080
I brought pickles.

1715
01:27:11,192 --> 01:27:12,557
Pickles.
Have a pickle.

1716
01:27:12,660 --> 01:27:14,457
Oh! That's just exactly
what we needed.

1717
01:27:14,562 --> 01:27:16,962
They'll go perfectly
with the egg salad sandwiches.

1718
01:27:17,065 --> 01:27:18,293
Oh, Gertrude's a
pretty bird!

1719
01:27:18,399 --> 01:27:19,866
(squawks)

1720
01:27:19,968 --> 01:27:21,765
- Oh.
- (sighs)

1721
01:27:21,869 --> 01:27:23,860
Miss Franny, this is Otis.

1722
01:27:23,972 --> 01:27:25,405
Oh! Oh!

1723
01:27:25,506 --> 01:27:27,133
What happened?
What happened?

1724
01:27:27,242 --> 01:27:28,368
The-the pickles fell.

1725
01:27:28,476 --> 01:27:30,569
It's a pleasure
to shake your hand, Otis.

1726
01:27:30,678 --> 01:27:32,043
Thank you.
I brought pickles.

1727
01:27:32,146 --> 01:27:33,704
Yes, I see. It's nice.

1728
01:27:33,815 --> 01:27:37,251
Oh, and this
is Gloria Dump.

1729
01:27:37,352 --> 01:27:41,982
I brought pickles
for the party.

1730
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:44,251
I'm glad you did.

1731
01:27:44,359 --> 01:27:48,261
I mean, wouldn't have been
no party without pickles.

1732
01:27:48,363 --> 01:27:51,093
Now, I've been
to several parties with no pickles.

1733
01:27:51,199 --> 01:27:52,291
(chuckles)

1734
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:54,595
A-And not one of
'em was any fun.

1735
01:27:54,702 --> 01:27:57,364
Otis, you can put
the pickles down right over here.

1736
01:27:57,472 --> 01:27:59,099
Thank you, ma'am.

1737
01:27:59,207 --> 01:28:01,266
(whispering):
Baby girl, what happened

1738
01:28:01,376 --> 01:28:02,775
with the Dewberry boys?

1739
01:28:02,877 --> 01:28:04,777
And where's the preacher?

1740
01:28:04,879 --> 01:28:06,107
Uh, I don't know.

1741
01:28:06,214 --> 01:28:08,114
Well, I told 'em what
time we're startin'.

1742
01:28:09,250 --> 01:28:10,774
GERTRUDE:
Uh-oh.

1743
01:28:10,885 --> 01:28:13,445
Look at that dog
and look at that bird!

1744
01:28:13,554 --> 01:28:15,613
- (laughing)
- Oh, no! Winn-Dixie!

1745
01:28:15,723 --> 01:28:17,691
No, Winn-Dixie!

1746
01:28:17,792 --> 01:28:20,693
Get down! Get down!

1747
01:28:20,795 --> 01:28:22,888
Winn-Dixie, come on.

1748
01:28:22,997 --> 01:28:25,591
Well, if we don't eat soon,
there won't be any food left.

1749
01:28:25,700 --> 01:28:26,928
I think you're right.

1750
01:28:27,035 --> 01:28:32,268
Let's just hold hands and...
give thanks for this.

1751
01:28:32,373 --> 01:28:34,603
Opal, give me your hand.

1752
01:28:34,709 --> 01:28:36,267
Winn-Dixie, sit.

1753
01:28:36,377 --> 01:28:38,937
Dear Lord
and Heavenly Father,

1754
01:28:39,047 --> 01:28:42,778
we have egg salad sandwiches,
we got Dump's punch,

1755
01:28:42,884 --> 01:28:45,944
we got pickles,
we got doggy pictures,

1756
01:28:46,054 --> 01:28:48,614
and we have
Littmus lozenges,

1757
01:28:48,723 --> 01:28:52,659
but, more importantly,
Dear Lord, we have good friends.

1758
01:28:52,760 --> 01:28:54,990
Dear Lord, we got
good friends to share

1759
01:28:55,096 --> 01:28:57,155
this warm summer night with us,

1760
01:28:57,265 --> 01:28:58,994
and, for that,
we're grateful.

1761
01:28:59,100 --> 01:29:03,332
Teach us, dear Lord,
to love one another.

1762
01:29:03,438 --> 01:29:05,497
This we ask in Your name.

1763
01:29:05,606 --> 01:29:06,698
Amen.

1764
01:29:06,808 --> 01:29:08,708
ALL:
Amen.

1765
01:29:08,810 --> 01:29:10,539
SWEETI E PI E:
Are we fixin' to eat now?

1766
01:29:10,645 --> 01:29:12,840
I think we might
want to eat inside.

1767
01:29:12,947 --> 01:29:14,175
(thunder rumbles)

1768
01:29:14,282 --> 01:29:15,715
It's not supposed to rain.

1769
01:29:15,817 --> 01:29:18,786
MISS FRANNY:
Oh! Oh, my God.

1770
01:29:18,886 --> 01:29:20,114
(shouting)

1771
01:29:20,221 --> 01:29:21,813
Nobody said rain.

1772
01:29:21,923 --> 01:29:23,948
It didn't pred...
Get the sandwiches!

1773
01:29:24,058 --> 01:29:25,047
Get the punch!

1774
01:29:25,159 --> 01:29:26,148
I got the plates!

1775
01:29:26,260 --> 01:29:27,955
Somebody get the punch!
Get the sandwiches!

1776
01:29:32,867 --> 01:29:35,165
Pickle?

1777
01:29:35,269 --> 01:29:36,600
(shouting)

1778
01:29:36,704 --> 01:29:39,605
Oh, yes, I'm cleaned up
real good, now.

1779
01:29:41,209 --> 01:29:43,609
Did you get
the sandwiches?

1780
01:29:43,711 --> 01:29:45,269
Somebody get
the sandwiches?

1781
01:29:45,380 --> 01:29:46,779
Yeah. They're
all wet, Gloria.

1782
01:29:46,881 --> 01:29:48,746
- And the punch?
- Yeah.

1783
01:29:48,850 --> 01:29:49,817
GERTRUDE:
Get the sandwiches?

1784
01:29:49,917 --> 01:29:50,884
(squawks)

1785
01:29:50,985 --> 01:29:51,952
Uh-oh.

1786
01:29:52,053 --> 01:29:53,782
Pickles. Pickles. Pickles.

1787
01:29:53,888 --> 01:29:55,150
Comin' down.

1788
01:29:55,256 --> 01:29:57,656
- Can I talk to you, please?
- Oh, sure.

1789
01:29:57,759 --> 01:29:58,783
GERTRUDE:
Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

1790
01:29:58,893 --> 01:30:01,453
Opal, you worked real hard. I...

1791
01:30:01,562 --> 01:30:02,529
I brought this for you.

1792
01:30:02,630 --> 01:30:04,222
I figured you'd earned it.

1793
01:30:04,332 --> 01:30:06,664
Oh! Thanks, Otis.

1794
01:30:06,768 --> 01:30:09,236
(squawking):
Dog! Dog! Dog!

1795
01:30:10,471 --> 01:30:12,837
Don't worry.
I got them dog pictures.

1796
01:30:12,940 --> 01:30:14,032
I got 'em right here.

1797
01:30:14,142 --> 01:30:16,007
Winn-Dixie!

1798
01:30:16,110 --> 01:30:17,270
Winn-Dixie!

1799
01:30:17,378 --> 01:30:19,209
Oh, no!

1800
01:30:19,313 --> 01:30:20,644
(gasps):
Winn-Dixie!

1801
01:30:20,748 --> 01:30:22,648
He's scared of thunder!

1802
01:30:22,750 --> 01:30:23,842
Winn... Winn-Dixie.

1803
01:30:23,951 --> 01:30:25,509
No, Winn-Dixie, no!

1804
01:30:25,620 --> 01:30:27,349
Opal, no, no, no.

1805
01:30:27,455 --> 01:30:28,945
- No, no!
- Look, he's probably outside

1806
01:30:29,056 --> 01:30:30,045
under the chair.

1807
01:30:30,158 --> 01:30:31,625
We'll take the
flashlight and go look.

1808
01:30:31,726 --> 01:30:32,784
No, no!

1809
01:30:32,894 --> 01:30:34,259
- I forgot to hold onto him!
- Opal! Opal!

1810
01:30:34,362 --> 01:30:36,387
Opal, take the flashlight.

1811
01:30:36,497 --> 01:30:38,158
Opal!

1812
01:30:38,266 --> 01:30:40,666
Opal! Uh...

1813
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:43,498
Winn-Dixie!

1814
01:30:43,604 --> 01:30:45,265
GLORIA:
You can't see!

1815
01:30:45,373 --> 01:30:47,603
Come back!

1816
01:30:47,708 --> 01:30:51,337
Opal! Opa...

1817
01:30:53,381 --> 01:30:55,212
Dewberry boys.

1818
01:30:55,316 --> 01:30:58,080
You got all wet. Opal!

1819
01:31:00,788 --> 01:31:03,086
No, Winn-Dixie!

1820
01:31:03,191 --> 01:31:05,022
Opal, your guests are here!

1821
01:31:05,126 --> 01:31:07,060
Opa...

1822
01:31:07,161 --> 01:31:09,994
Opal, your guests
are here.

1823
01:31:10,097 --> 01:31:12,065
I don't care!

1824
01:31:12,166 --> 01:31:13,997
Now, you come up here
right this minute!

1825
01:31:14,101 --> 01:31:15,568
Come right up here!

1826
01:31:16,771 --> 01:31:19,069
Now, let me
tell you somethin'!

1827
01:31:19,173 --> 01:31:20,401
This is your party,

1828
01:31:20,508 --> 01:31:21,873
and I want you
to tell these boys

1829
01:31:21,976 --> 01:31:23,273
how glad you are
that they came.

1830
01:31:23,377 --> 01:31:25,675
Thank you for comin'
to my party.

1831
01:31:25,780 --> 01:31:28,180
It's just I got to find
Winn-Dixie.

1832
01:31:28,282 --> 01:31:30,011
You want me to help?

1833
01:31:30,117 --> 01:31:31,414
Listen...

1834
01:31:31,519 --> 01:31:33,350
Opal...

1835
01:31:33,454 --> 01:31:36,184
you cannot hold onto anything
that wants to go.

1836
01:31:36,290 --> 01:31:37,621
Do you understand
what I'm sayin'?

1837
01:31:38,759 --> 01:31:40,784
You just got to love it

1838
01:31:40,895 --> 01:31:42,954
while you got it,
and that's that.

1839
01:31:43,064 --> 01:31:44,554
(panting)

1840
01:31:44,665 --> 01:31:45,825
I just got to find him!

1841
01:31:45,933 --> 01:31:48,401
Opal, wait
till the rain stops!

1842
01:31:48,503 --> 01:31:49,765
Opal!

1843
01:31:49,871 --> 01:31:52,396
Opal...

1844
01:31:54,509 --> 01:31:56,739
Winn-Dixie!

1845
01:31:57,778 --> 01:32:01,077
Winn-Dixie!

1846
01:32:02,116 --> 01:32:05,085
(grunts)

1847
01:32:06,153 --> 01:32:07,586
(pants):
Is he here?!

1848
01:32:07,688 --> 01:32:08,655
Who?

1849
01:32:08,756 --> 01:32:11,247
Winn-Dixie! He's gone!

1850
01:32:11,359 --> 01:32:12,758
He ran away
because of the storm,

1851
01:32:12,860 --> 01:32:13,849
and I can't find him!

1852
01:32:13,961 --> 01:32:15,292
Come on in out
of the rain, Opal.

1853
01:32:15,396 --> 01:32:16,624
Come on!

1854
01:32:16,731 --> 01:32:17,959
We were at the party,

1855
01:32:18,065 --> 01:32:19,760
and you were supposed
to be there!

1856
01:32:22,503 --> 01:32:23,561
(panting)

1857
01:32:23,671 --> 01:32:25,696
And you weren't,
and now he's gone!

1858
01:32:25,806 --> 01:32:26,773
Opal.

1859
01:32:26,874 --> 01:32:28,341
Op...!

1860
01:32:28,442 --> 01:32:31,275
Opal!

1861
01:32:31,379 --> 01:32:32,744
Come back here!

1862
01:32:32,847 --> 01:32:34,405
Opal!

1863
01:32:34,515 --> 01:32:35,743
Here, take your raincoat.

1864
01:32:35,850 --> 01:32:37,909
We'll look for him together.

1865
01:32:43,691 --> 01:32:44,851
Winn-Dixie!

1866
01:32:44,959 --> 01:32:46,449
Winn-Dixie?

1867
01:32:48,162 --> 01:32:50,790
I'll write a list
of ten things about him.

1868
01:32:50,898 --> 01:32:53,560
That way, people'll know him
if they see him.

1869
01:32:53,668 --> 01:32:55,636
We'll find him, Opal.

1870
01:32:57,038 --> 01:33:00,997
One: He has a pathological fear
of thunderstorms.

1871
01:33:01,108 --> 01:33:05,408
Two: He likes to smile
at everyone he meets.

1872
01:33:05,513 --> 01:33:09,745
Three:
He likes going to church.

1873
01:33:09,850 --> 01:33:12,546
Four: He snores.

1874
01:33:12,653 --> 01:33:18,853
Five: He can catch mice
without squishing 'em to death.

1875
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:20,291
Number six.

1876
01:33:20,394 --> 01:33:23,625
Number six is he likes
to meet people.

1877
01:33:25,099 --> 01:33:29,399
Number seven: He sure does like
peanut butter.

1878
01:33:32,907 --> 01:33:37,276
Number eight: He can't stand
to be left alone.

1879
01:33:37,378 --> 01:33:42,111
Nine: He likes to sit on
couches and sleep in beds.

1880
01:33:42,216 --> 01:33:48,280
Number ten is... he was a dog
who knew how to be a friend.

1881
01:33:48,389 --> 01:33:52,883
I kept on goin'over and over
that list in my head,

1882
01:33:52,994 --> 01:33:54,518
the same way I did
with the list

1883
01:33:54,629 --> 01:33:55,960
of ten things about my mama.

1884
01:33:56,063 --> 01:33:57,621
Winn-Dixie!

1885
01:33:57,732 --> 01:34:01,293
I memorized it
so if I didn't find him,

1886
01:34:01,402 --> 01:34:04,633
I'd at least have
some part of him to hold onto.

1887
01:34:04,739 --> 01:34:06,536
Winn-Dixie!

1888
01:34:10,645 --> 01:34:13,546
(sighs)

1889
01:34:15,483 --> 01:34:17,041
It's gettin' late, Opal.

1890
01:34:17,151 --> 01:34:18,880
You're gettin' tired.

1891
01:34:18,986 --> 01:34:20,613
We need to head back.

1892
01:34:20,721 --> 01:34:22,518
But, Daddy,
he's out there.

1893
01:34:22,623 --> 01:34:23,920
We can't leave him.

1894
01:34:24,025 --> 01:34:26,687
Well, there's only
so much lookin' we can do.

1895
01:34:26,794 --> 01:34:28,523
(sighs)

1896
01:34:32,566 --> 01:34:34,158
You're gonna give up.

1897
01:34:34,268 --> 01:34:35,235
Opal...

1898
01:34:35,336 --> 01:34:37,668
You give up on everything.

1899
01:34:37,772 --> 01:34:38,796
That's not true.

1900
01:34:38,906 --> 01:34:40,134
It is true.

1901
01:34:40,241 --> 01:34:42,141
All you do is give up.

1902
01:34:42,243 --> 01:34:43,505
Just pull your head

1903
01:34:43,611 --> 01:34:46,603
back inside your stupid
turtle shell and give up.

1904
01:34:46,714 --> 01:34:48,705
You won't talk.

1905
01:34:48,816 --> 01:34:50,909
You won't go
to parties.

1906
01:34:51,018 --> 01:34:52,246
(sighs)

1907
01:34:52,353 --> 01:34:54,844
And I bet you didn't
even go out lookin'

1908
01:34:54,955 --> 01:34:56,582
for my mama when she left.

1909
01:34:56,691 --> 01:34:58,659
(sighs)

1910
01:34:58,759 --> 01:35:01,091
I bet you just let her
run off, too.

1911
01:35:01,195 --> 01:35:03,095
I couldn't stop her.
I tried.

1912
01:35:03,197 --> 01:35:04,892
I... No, loo... I tried.

1913
01:35:04,999 --> 01:35:06,557
You don't think
I wanted her to stay, too?

1914
01:35:06,667 --> 01:35:07,759
She was everything to me.

1915
01:35:07,868 --> 01:35:09,358
- You didn't try.
- Yes, I did.

1916
01:35:09,470 --> 01:35:10,937
She wasn't everything to you.

1917
01:35:11,038 --> 01:35:13,199
Yes, she was.
Opal, she was everything.

1918
01:35:13,307 --> 01:35:15,935
Everything. I f...
I failed her, all right?

1919
01:35:16,043 --> 01:35:17,772
I failed her.

1920
01:35:17,878 --> 01:35:20,176
I failed her, Opal.
I tried and I t...

1921
01:35:20,281 --> 01:35:22,146
- You didn't try!
- I tried and I tr...

1922
01:35:22,249 --> 01:35:23,375
- I know you didn't.
- I tried.

1923
01:35:23,484 --> 01:35:27,614
I did. I tried
and I tried and I tried

1924
01:35:27,722 --> 01:35:29,587
with everything I am.

1925
01:35:34,695 --> 01:35:36,526
It's my fault.

1926
01:35:36,630 --> 01:35:40,589
Opal... it's all my fault.

1927
01:35:42,837 --> 01:35:45,601
I'm sorry.

1928
01:35:50,711 --> 01:35:52,110
(whispering):
Daddy...

1929
01:35:52,213 --> 01:35:54,443
I ju...

1930
01:35:54,548 --> 01:35:57,483
And don't... don't believe
losing Winn-Dixie

1931
01:35:57,585 --> 01:35:59,883
isn't gonna upset me
as much as it does you.

1932
01:35:59,987 --> 01:36:01,648
I love that dog.

1933
01:36:01,756 --> 01:36:03,815
I love him, too.

1934
01:36:09,563 --> 01:36:10,655
(sighs)

1935
01:36:10,765 --> 01:36:12,596
(whispering):
I love you, Daddy.

1936
01:36:12,700 --> 01:36:13,962
(sighs)

1937
01:36:15,102 --> 01:36:17,662
I love you, too.

1938
01:36:31,752 --> 01:36:34,312
Daddy...

1939
01:36:34,421 --> 01:36:36,412
do you think Mama
will ever come back?

1940
01:36:36,524 --> 01:36:39,015
No. No, I don't, Opal.

1941
01:36:39,126 --> 01:36:41,526
I've hoped and prayed and
dreamed about her comin' back.

1942
01:36:41,629 --> 01:36:43,529
I don't think
it's gonna happen.

1943
01:36:43,631 --> 01:36:46,862
Gloria told me that you can't
hold onto anybody...

1944
01:36:46,967 --> 01:36:50,562
that you can only love what
you got while you've got it.

1945
01:36:52,373 --> 01:36:55,638
Gloria Dump is a wise person.

1946
01:36:57,945 --> 01:37:00,641
But I'm not ready
to let Winn-Dixie go.

1947
01:37:00,748 --> 01:37:03,216
Well, we'll keep on lookin'.

1948
01:37:03,317 --> 01:37:05,717
Opal...

1949
01:37:05,820 --> 01:37:07,151
do you remember
when I told you

1950
01:37:07,254 --> 01:37:09,722
that your mama took everything
with her when she left?

1951
01:37:09,824 --> 01:37:10,791
Yes, sir.

1952
01:37:10,891 --> 01:37:12,051
Well, there's one

1953
01:37:12,159 --> 01:37:14,923
very important thing
she left behind.

1954
01:37:15,029 --> 01:37:16,257
What?

1955
01:37:16,363 --> 01:37:18,490
You.

Thank God your mama left me you.

01:37:33,414 --> 01:37:35,314
Did you find him?

No.

1960
01:37:36,650 --> 01:37:39,710
Not yet. We haven't
found him yet.

1961
01:37:40,754 --> 01:37:42,483
We went looking, too.

1962

MISS FRANNY:
I'm sorry, Opal.

1964
01:37:46,527 --> 01:37:48,586
We just drove
all over town.

1965
01:37:48,696 --> 01:37:51,392
I had a dog once that wandered
all over the place.

1966
01:37:51,498 --> 01:37:52,487
And?

1967
01:37:52,600 --> 01:37:56,559
And... when he got
through wanderin'...

1968
01:37:56,670 --> 01:37:58,661
he came home.

1969
01:37:58,772 --> 01:38:00,137
Don't worry, Opal.

1970
01:38:00,241 --> 01:38:04,109
He'll come back.
He's got to.

1971
01:38:04,211 --> 01:38:05,473
Preacher?

1972

1982
01:38:55,129 --> 01:38:57,256
You want to come
back inside?

1983
01:38:57,364 --> 01:38:59,855
