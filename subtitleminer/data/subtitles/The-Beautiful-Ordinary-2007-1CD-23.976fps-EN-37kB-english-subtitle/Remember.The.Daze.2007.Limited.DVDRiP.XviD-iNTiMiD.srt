<i>Class of 199-fucking-9!</i>

<i>Come on, we gotta
party like It's 1999!</i>

3
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:30,988
<i>I just don't
understand anything.</i>

4
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:33,362
<i>I don't wanna
face those people.</i>

5
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:35,492
<i>Only you know
what you want.</i>

6
00:00:35,568 --> 00:00:37,866
<i>I'm stuck with this routine.</i>

7
00:00:37,937 --> 00:00:41,134
<i>It's the last day
of school forever.</i>

8
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:46,332
Good luck.

9
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:48,033
Thanks.

10
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:00,118
Come on, wake up, Julia.

11
00:02:00,186 --> 00:02:02,916
Hm.

12
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:07,585
Today is the beginning of the
end and the end of the beginning.

13
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,457
And you don't
wanna be late for it.

14
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:12,327
You always say that.

15
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:23,873
Angie.

16
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:27,106
Angie. It's time
to wake up.

17
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,206
<i>It's your last day
In middle school.</i>

18
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,315
You know what
your counselor said.

19
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:38,823
<i>You won't be able to
finish junior high school</i>

20
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:41,725
<i>If you miss
one more half day.</i>

21
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:43,785
<i>Little Angie</i>

22
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:48,757
Get the fuck out of here!

23
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,894
Unbelievable.

24
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:51,698
Hm.

25
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:40,244
I wrote a new
song last night.

26
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:44,256
Sweet.

27
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:45,916
We can
practice it later.

28
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:49,257
H m.

29
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:51,593
You want
some of this? Huh?

30
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:56,902
Last day
of school! Oh, shit!

31
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:57,994
Oh, shit!

32
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:01,066
The car,
what the hell.

33
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,937
<i>Fuck you both.</i>

34
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:05,409
<i>Oh, nice nighty.</i>

35
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:07,810
I'll see you later.

36
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:12,918
Shit. Shit!

37
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:14,544
What's up, ass fuck?

38
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:16,145
Come on. Come on.

39
00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:18,349
More. More. More!

40
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:20,818
Oh. God.

41
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:23,418
What's wrong
with you?

42
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:24,895
Wow!

43
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:38,236
I don't even remember when
I actually ever decided

44
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:40,711
Brown was where I
wanted to got to college.

45
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:45,217
<i>God. Rhode Island. I'm not
gonna know a single soul.</i>

46
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:48,277
Man, you know, even
if Brown does suck,

47
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:51,755
at least you're
experiencing some place new.

48
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:54,588
I mean, I was looking at
this brochure the other day,

49
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:56,788
<i>for NYU and my mom
started flipping out</i>

50
00:04:56,863 --> 00:05:00,128
saying that New York
was all about sex and drugs

51
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:02,292
and I wanted to be,
like, you know what?

52
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:05,735
I'm not a virgin.
I already have a tattoo

53
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,363
and I do
a ton of drugs here.

54
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:11,000
Oh, God.

55
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:41,738
<i>I'm gonna be real
famous some day.</i>

56
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:43,776
Watch!

57
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:59,180
<i>Stacy.</i>

58
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:02,819

60
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:06,728
Mom. Stop saying
my name so much.

61
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:08,130
You forgot your lunch.

62
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,192
Stacey.

63
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:11,736
Hi, Mrs. Cherry.

64
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:15,570
Hello, Julia. Hi. Say hello, Sockets.

65
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:16,972
Yeah. Your
dog hates you.

66
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,341
So you guys are ready for summer?

67
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:20,879
Mom.

68
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:23,745
Has Stacey been smoking
any of the funny stuff, huh?

69
00:06:23,816 --> 00:06:26,614
Mom. Go in the
house, now. Okay? Bye.

70
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:27,812
Bye. Say Bye-bye.

71
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,149
<i>Bye. Mom.</i>

72
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:36,485
Oh my God.
My mom is so insane.

73
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,757
I
wouldn't complain,

74
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:41,095
your boyfriend lives
in your basement

75
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:43,499
for a year now? And
she still has no clue.

76
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:46,538
What was I supposed to do?
His grandmother kicked him out.

77
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:49,803
I'm just saying I can't believe
she still hasn't figured it out.

78
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:53,573
Well my mom choses what she wants to
know and what she doesn't want to know.

79
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:56,410
Hm. Kinda like, you.

80
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:59,451
Hey, Dylan might
treat me like crap

81
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:03,455
but he's not cheating on me. And if he
cheated on me, then I would dump him.

82
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:06,185
Let's not talk about it.

83
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:14,759
Don't do it.

84
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:17,064
What?

85
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,533
<i>Julia, don't.
Come on.</i>

86

gonna hurt our friend.

87
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,670
Ahhh!

88
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:27,042
<i>There she goes.</i>

89
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,546
Hey, ugly.

90
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:30,707
Ha, ha, ha.
You're such an ass.

91
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:34,844
Oh, I know. Come
on, shut up and get in.

92
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:36,320
<i>I love you.</i>

93
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:39,085
I hate you.

94

<i>I know,
I know.</i>

95
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:44,852
So you guys are coming to
my pep rally later, right?

96
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:48,367
Yeah. About that... Nah.

97
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:50,561
Stop it.
You are coming.

98
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:52,968
<i>Class of '99.
The sons of bitches.</i>

99
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,031
<i>I can't believe that we
are officlally seniors.</i>

100
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:59,600
Like, next year that's gonna be
out last year. How crazy is that?

101
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:02,739
Another whole year until we
actually get out of this place.

102
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,476
Exactly.

103
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:08,577
In the meantime we can still get
really, really, really wasted.

104
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:12,351
Oh my God. You're such a cheerleader.

105
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:23,094
Good morning to you.

106
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:26,036
<i>I hope this very reliable
tardiness habit of yours</i>

107
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:28,733
will not be continuing
into the next year.

108
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:33,472
<i>High school is just one mind
In a whole lot of bodies.</i>

109
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:36,982
<i>And I know how
that mind thinks.</i>

110
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:40,985
So keep that in mind.

111
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:48,120
<i>What Is our
purpose? Our meaning?</i>

112
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,992
Why are we all here and what
are we each supposed to do?

113
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:52,758
<i>Is there some
predetermined plan</i>

114
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:55,130
<i>driving all the decisions that we make,</i>

115
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,396
or are we ourselves
making our choices

116
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:00,234
based on our
own free wills?

117
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:04,174
<i>These mental thoughts
are liminal phases.</i>

118
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:06,905
<i>Childhood Is about magic,</i>

119
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:09,607
<i>but teen Is about mystery.</i>

120
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:13,379
It is the time when the
world suddenly gets closer

121
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:15,181
and the colors get brighter.

122

<i>Rules seem
ready to be broken.</i>

<i>But It Is the same problem.</i>

125
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:26,028
You got to figure
out what you want.

126

00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:31,289
<i>Mod.</i>

163
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:36,925
<i>A w, come on.</i>

164
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:39,055
You girls
want some weed?

165
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:42,794
<i>You've all played
dominoes. When you topple one</i>

166
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:46,269
<i>the others fall In sult. This
would be an Isolated system</i>

167
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:49,501
<i>except for the fact that
something outside the system</i>

168
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:54,478
<i>Yeah, Mod.</i>

169
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:55,946
He didn't take a hall pass.

170
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:58,449
Oh, he's got a permanent
note, Mr. Shapiro.

171
00:11:58,517 --> 00:11:59,950
You know, for AD H D.

172
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:02,283
<i>He'd better not miss
my frigging pep really.</i>

173
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:04,982
Don't forget it.
It's during last period.

174
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,081
Okay.

175
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:07,682
I will be tumbling.

176
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:11,786
I just want to remind
everybody of the pep rally.

177
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:13,161
<i>Oh, great.</i>

178
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:16,099
The spirit
is important.

179
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:18,136
I don't want to
see one empty seat.

180
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:19,865
<i>Pull your skirt up!</i>

181
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:21,167
So, you
should all come.

182
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,901
<i>Okay?</i>

183
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:25,603
<i>In the larger systems...</i>

184
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,916
You'd better run, bitch.

185
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:42,089
I gotta shit.

186
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:44,254
Oh, yeah.

187
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,524
<i>What's up, babe?</i>

188
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,327
How are you doing?

189
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:49,765
How you doing
son? Hey, hey.

190
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:51,996
Why don't you come to
our show tonight? Huh?

191
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:54,301
Come on, we gotta go.
Gotta run. And just go.

192
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:56,500
Ah!

193
00:12:56,575 --> 00:13:00,944
<i>Jesus.</i>

194
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:03,072
See you.

195
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:13,316
Hey.

196
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:14,654
What's up. Hey.

197
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:16,820
You suck.

198
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:18,090
Hey. Uh!

199
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:31,505
Dude, remember that
time that I got so wasted

200
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:33,442
that I pissed
on your sock drawer?

201
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:36,811
And I didn't tell you about it
for like three months or something.

202
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:39,783
Okay. You better just
come to my pep rally.

203
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:41,649
<i>Hi, guys.</i>

204
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,553
Guess what?
The Banks have shrooms.

205
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:46,648
Hey, I told
her that.

206
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:49,626
Oh my God, we should totally
trip our faces off later.

207
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,787
Yeah.

208
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:52,353
How much
do they have?

209
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:54,899
See what you've done to her? N ice work.

210
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:56,935
Hanky, have
you seen Pete?

211
00:13:57,002 --> 00:14:00,631
Uh, okay, you're lame, he's
your boyfriend, after all.

212
00:14:00,706 --> 00:14:02,606
No, you're lame.
Your name is Hanky.

213
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,074
Alright,
I'm leaving.

214
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:05,269
I'll see
you later.

215
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,039
Are you going
to get wasted?

216
00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:11,879
No, I'm going to Pete's house
and drag his lazy ass out of bed.

217
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:14,715
Don't you dare
miss my pep rally!

218
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:31,101
Wake up.

219
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:33,798
Hm. Come here.

220
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:41,536
<i>Get up. No!
I'm serious.</i>

221
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:47,413
I'm serious. I'm serious,
dude. Just get up.

222
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:49,716
You act like there's a
reason for me to get up.

223
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:56,425
It's a nice
thing to say to me.

224
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:59,293
Do you not get it?
This is embarrassing.

225
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:04,200
Just because you're not graduating
today doesn't mean it's forever.

226
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,295
Stop it.

227
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:10,433
Stop it and get up. I'm begging you
for the millionth morning, please.

228
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:23,717
<i>Come and help
me pick out a shirt.</i>

229
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:37,062
Don't.

230
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:45,542
You know what?
I really can't go.

231
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:49,206
What? I just drove all the way down
here and waited while you got ready.

232
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:52,375
Whatever. The only reason you
come here is to get me out of bed.

233
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,578
You act like
that's a bad reason.

234
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:57,213
I just wish it
wasn't the only one.

235
00:15:57,289 --> 00:16:00,781
Oh my God.
You're ridiculous.

236
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:04,556
Are you coming
with me or not?

237
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,224
Maybe I'll see
you later tonight.

238
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:13,428
<i>Who-hoo. Stacey
Is the girl I</i>

239
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:26,975
Shot gun!

240
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:40,249
<i>Pick me up when you get pot, okay?</i>

241
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:41,622
Brianne, I have pot.

242
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:43,923
I thought we were getting the mushrooms.

243
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:45,588
I'll see you later.

244
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:52,197
You did good out there.

245
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:55,172
<i>Thanks, I wish more than
ten people came, but thanks.</i>

246
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,539
Okay. Where do
we go from here?

247
00:17:58,610 --> 00:17:59,736
Where did Brianne go?

248
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:01,211
Can you take me home?

249
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,376
What? Summer just started.
I can't believe this.

250
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:07,817
What? I just have to
change. I'll be right back.

251
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:09,478
You still have
boring old me, Dawn.

252
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,695
Hey, guys.

253
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,526
The Banks
have mushrooms.

254
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,156
Yeah, Brianne
already told me.

255
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:22,257
Of course she did.

256
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:25,602
That was the last
time I shared.

257
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:28,139
I was so proud of myself
I fucked my brother, man.

258
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:33,509
I'm serious, fuck him, dude, he's probably
got 20 left and he's the fucking sell.

259
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:34,637
Hey.

260
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:37,375
Huh? Hey.
Hey, Mod.

261
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,280
Ah!

262
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:42,379
What?

263
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:43,648
Help.

264
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:44,950
Sorry you had to wait.

265
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:49,585
Had to handle, uh,
some business. Fuck!

266
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:53,563
Take care of business. What business?

267
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:56,829
That business. You just witnessed
my fucking business. Okay?

268
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:59,666
<i>For your fucking Information,
I sold all my weed.</i>

269
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:02,002
Did you sell yours?
I don't fucking think so.

270
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:03,803
You're so
special to me.

271
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:08,939
Stop touching me and shit, man.
I'm jumpy right now. Just fuck out.

272
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:11,073
Yeah, I need to
smoke some weed.

273
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:18,721
So is Dylan downstairs?

274
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,917
Yes.

275
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,120
Yeah, tell that
asshole I said hi.

276
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:26,028
Bye, guys.

277
00:19:55,794 --> 00:19:57,625
Hey.

278
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:01,894
Oh, watch this.

279
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:04,128
<i>Look up.</i>

280
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:09,004
<i>It took me
all day to do that.</i>

281
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:11,304
I can't wait to
get drunk tonight.

282
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:14,470
<i>It's not fair, you know,
I have to go to school</i>

283
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:17,640
and you get to sit in here
and do what you want all day.

284
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:21,152
<i>Tell me again why suspension
Is such a bad thing.</i>

285
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,656
Because I sit down here alone
all day waiting for your fine ass.

286
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,213
<i>And I'm starving.</i>

287
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:29,124
Why don't you just make
yourself a sandwich upstairs?

288
00:20:29,194 --> 00:20:32,357
'Cause I'm lazy and I
knew you'd be home soon.

289
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:35,525
Dylan.

290
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:37,967
My mom might
be home any minute.

291
00:20:38,036 --> 00:20:41,767
She ain't never
been a problem before.

292
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:56,449
You know what
this kid said?

293
00:20:56,521 --> 00:21:00,048
<i>I'm telling you, man, butts are
the new boobs Trust me. I know.</i>

294
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:03,424
Now that I'm in high school I'm
gonna go get me a nice big Freshman...

295
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:04,723
Yeah. Freshman.

296
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:07,856
<i>Hey, Riley,
what's popping?</i>

297
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,697
<i>You all know Riley?
Riley's a sophomore.</i>

298
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:14,796
First of all, you sound
like a complete fucking tool.

299
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:18,104
And second, fuck a
freshman, you know?

300
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:22,579
Talking about the seniors. So get back
to me on how that butt stiffing goes.

301
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:27,017
'Cause I'm gonna be busy
punishing that prime ass.

302
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:28,848
18-year-olds
know what's up, son.

303
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,979
What's up?
Don't touch me.

304
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:33,718
Riley lost his virginity
when he was like 9 years old.

305
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:37,421
He's fucked like every girl
in the entire freshman class.

306
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:39,225
You're damn
right I have.

307
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,732
<i>Hello, kiddies.</i>

308
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:48,030
Wooo!

309
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:52,607
<i>Woo-hoo.</i>

310
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:56,876
Howdy howdy.
Let's get rowdy.

311
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,787
How're you doing?

312
00:22:02,854 --> 00:22:03,946
Alright.

313
00:22:04,022 --> 00:22:06,684
Son of a bitch.

314
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,086
Woo!

315
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,255
Do you wanna get
some beer or what, man?

316
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,799
Whatever. I don't care.

317
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:16,925
Dude, what is
wrong with you?

318
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:19,994
I don't know, I failed too many
classes to graduate on time.

319
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:22,267
And my girlfriend
doesn't like me anymore.

320
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,933
Whatever, man.
Screw it.

321
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:26,807
None of that shit matters.
I'll tell you what matters.

322
00:22:26,878 --> 00:22:28,209
Beer. Beer matters.

323
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,271
Do me a favor. Stop
trying to cheer me up.

324
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,909
Aw, fuck Julia, dude.

325
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:34,474
High school girls suck.

326
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:37,818
College bitches are way
cooler. Trust me, I know this.

327
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:42,451
Oh, and, um, who here
is going to college?

328
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:45,462
No, I don't know if I want
to break up with Pete or not.

329
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,498
<i>I mean, after all</i>

330
00:22:47,566 --> 00:22:51,229
is he gonna be around my whole senior
year as the guy that didn't graduate?

331
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:54,704
<i>But what If I break up with
him and then I want him back?</i>

332
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:57,765
<i>What I need to do, I need
to hook up with someone else.</i>

333
00:22:57,843 --> 00:22:59,868
That way I can see.

334
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:03,108
<i>I won't make the break up
decision without knowing for sure.</i>

335
00:23:03,181 --> 00:23:08,016
<i>But I need to think about It
because Pete can't find out.</i>

336
00:23:08,086 --> 00:23:10,987
<i>No. The last thing you wanna
do Is be caught up In a secret.</i>

337
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:14,548
<i>I'm stuck In
this routine.</i>

338
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:18,153
I try to get my sister to be more
obedient and help out with my parents

339
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:21,063
I try to get Stacey out of
her abusive relationships

340
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:23,966
so that she can actually be
happy instead of faking it.

341
00:23:24,035 --> 00:23:26,731
Do you think
Dylan hits Stacey?

342
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:28,204
I know he's not good.

343
00:23:28,273 --> 00:23:30,366
I'm gonna fucking
kill that kid.

344
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:33,536
Stacey won't break up with
him unless he cheats on her.

345
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:36,775
I know exactly who
you should hook up with.

346
00:23:43,121 --> 00:23:44,986
Dylan, I wasn't finished.

347
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:49,153
That's my
homies. Peace.

348
00:23:51,963 --> 00:23:55,455
<i>Come on, come on, come
on. Bring your yellow ass.</i>

349
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:00,461
<i>Move, man. I ain't got all day.</i>

350
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:02,006
I like the back
seat anyway.

351
00:24:02,073 --> 00:24:04,007
Yeah, that's
what I thought.

352
00:24:06,978 --> 00:24:08,104
What's up, son?

353
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,080
There's crank
in this mother.

354
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:16,516
Hey, what the
hell is that smell?

355
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:18,249
You smell that?

356
00:24:18,323 --> 00:24:21,724
<i>It smells like what Stacey
wears, that Plumero shit...</i>

357
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:25,229
No, this is Country Apple, man,
it's nice, I got two bottles.

358
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:28,027
<i>But Plumero's cool too, I
got some of that at the house.</i>

359
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:30,932
Eddie, you're
so gay.

360
00:24:31,002 --> 00:24:33,197
Well, I mean, I think
it smells really good.

361
00:24:33,271 --> 00:24:34,932
Just what
I thought.

362
00:24:35,006 --> 00:24:37,668
You're gay. You've never fucked a bitch.

363
00:24:37,742 --> 00:24:38,902
That's true.

364
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:41,002
No, man, that's
not true, I have so.

365
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:44,640
<i>No. Bullshit. The simple fact
Is you want that shit so bad.</i>

366
00:24:44,716 --> 00:24:48,447
You end up driving the pussy
away, Now, you take a cat like me,

367
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:52,718
I did everything I want
'cause I don't want nothing.

368
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:54,691
Fuck bitches.

369
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:56,659
Hold on, man, I ain't saying all that.

370
00:24:56,728 --> 00:24:58,923
Zack, don't even listen
to Biz, he's ugly.

371
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:00,692
Me and you are
on the same page.

372
00:25:00,765 --> 00:25:02,562
We're on the same
side of the tracks.

373
00:25:02,634 --> 00:25:04,363
You make your own fate.

374
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:07,428
Now matter how many dudes
shot you down, you'll get one.

375
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,667
You make your fate.

376
00:25:09,741 --> 00:25:12,335
Yeah, man, my fate is
working in my dad's garage.

377
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:15,038
It's a
great thing.

378
00:25:15,113 --> 00:25:16,307
Yo. Slow down.

379
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:23,948
What's up?
What's your name?

380
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:26,957
Holly. Oh my gosh, we just
finished middle school.

381
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:28,617
Right now.
Right now.

382
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:32,026
So you guys are officially all
high school freshmen now, huh?

383
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:33,394
Hell, yeah.

384
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:35,296
About time.

385
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:38,569
Man, move it, dip shit.

386
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:41,105
So, you got a
license, young blood?

387
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:42,935
<i>No. Why? Are you a cop?</i>

388
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:45,568
Not yet.

389
00:25:46,811 --> 00:25:50,440
So where
are you'all goin'?

390
00:25:50,515 --> 00:25:52,073
Wherever you tell us.

391
00:25:54,986 --> 00:25:57,511
What should we say?
And where are we going?

392
00:25:57,589 --> 00:25:59,523
Man, fuck it.
Drive away.

393
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:02,958
Let's go to Bailey's. They're
practicing for tonight.

394
00:26:03,028 --> 00:26:05,189
Meet us at
Bailey's House.

395
00:26:05,263 --> 00:26:06,560
Alright.

396
00:26:06,631 --> 00:26:08,758
<i>You could even
just follow us there.</i>

397
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:13,167
Man, what the fu... Bailey don't want
hoes over there when they're rehearsing.

398
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:15,172
I do. I love hoes.

399
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:20,636
Big Bailey.
How ya doin' man?

400
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:22,543
Hey, man.

401
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:24,206
What's up, man?
Good to see you.

402
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:27,115
What are you guys doing? Are
you sort of chilling out or...

403
00:26:27,185 --> 00:26:30,120
Hey, hey.
What's up, man?

404
00:26:30,188 --> 00:26:31,621
Hi.

405
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:34,022
Hey, uh, you guys came
here just to hang out...?

406
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:35,753
Yeah.

407
00:26:35,827 --> 00:26:39,786
Cool. We're just practicing. You
can sit on the couch over here.

408
00:26:39,864 --> 00:26:41,195
Alright.

409
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:43,063
Yeah. To the left.

410
00:26:43,134 --> 00:26:46,228
Are you ready for
some monkey ass?

411
00:26:46,304 --> 00:26:48,295
Yo. Gimme
that. Go.

412
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:52,036
You know who it is it's
that big boy Biz. Now.

413
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:07,082
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

414
00:27:07,158 --> 00:27:09,388
<i>Have you ever looked
out to a blue ocean?</i>

415
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:11,019
Oh, man.

416
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:14,657
What's happenin', baby?

417
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:17,634
So, hey, did you
all graduate today?

418
00:27:17,702 --> 00:27:20,671
Fuck,
no. These two did.

419
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:23,105
<i>I got one more year more
to go. I'm a young bitch.</i>

420
00:27:23,174 --> 00:27:26,541
<i>Are you gonna keep playing
together when you go to college?</i>

421
00:27:26,611 --> 00:27:29,774
We're actually not going to
college. We're punk rockers

422
00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:31,941
So we're just gonna continue playing.

423
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:33,951
Yeah. We're just
gonna do that.

424
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:35,953
Yeah.

425
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:39,787
That's cool. And your parents
just don't care? It's awesome!

426
00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:42,452
No...

427
00:27:42,527 --> 00:27:48,022
No, fuck, my parents are furious
at me for not applying to college.

428
00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:50,761
This is your
family too, right?

429
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:53,531
You're choosing us, right,
not... not your parents.

430
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:56,506
I'm just saying. It's a pretty
risky decision these days

431
00:27:56,574 --> 00:27:58,439
to not apply to
college. That's all.

432
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:02,344
Regardless, we're gonna, you know,
continue until we have success, right?

433
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:04,177
I mean, that's
the plan. Right?

434
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:07,514
Who cares if we're
successful, man?

435
00:28:07,585 --> 00:28:09,951
As long as we're
having a good time.

436
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:14,924
<i>These good times, right, how are they
gonna continue unless we make money?</i>

437
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:16,187
Fucking idiot.

438
00:28:18,063 --> 00:28:22,500
He does write all our songs and,
you know, he's a lyrical genius.

439
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:25,502
<i>So I guess that's why he
doesn't live In reality.</i>

440
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:30,200
God. Uh! Ah!

441
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:41,918
Uh...

442
00:28:41,986 --> 00:28:43,419
I like this.

443
00:28:43,488 --> 00:28:44,648
It likes you.

444
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:48,557
So what are
you doing later?

445
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:52,357
I don't
know. Actually...

446
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:54,330
Right. Right.
Okay, so.

447
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:55,764
<i>Time to start.</i>

448
00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:58,894
I'm an idiot. We're
actually playing at a show

449
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:01,598
um, I'm in this
band, Over It.

450
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:05,609
Uh, you know... That's alright...
The band's called Over It.

451
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:08,612
And, see? You can see
it on that drum there.

452
00:29:10,615 --> 00:29:14,881
You should come to the show. I mean,
do you wanna come? Do you wanna come?

453
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:17,922
Do you guys have plans or
what are you guys doing?

454
00:29:17,989 --> 00:29:20,583
I don't really know.

455
00:29:35,507 --> 00:29:37,270
<i>My first time
babysitting.</i>

456
00:29:37,342 --> 00:29:38,969
Try to act like
a normal person.

457
00:29:39,043 --> 00:29:44,003
Oh, that'll be hard.

458
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:47,779
Tori, hi, wow,
who's running late?

459
00:29:47,852 --> 00:29:51,515
Please, hurry up and come in
because I need to leave like now.

460
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:55,218
Hi, mwah. Oh. Come in.
Come in. Come in. Come in.

461
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:59,252
I am so sorry, Mr. Turner
told me 4:45. Am I really late?

462
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:03,027
<i>Oh, well, apparently not
In my dear husband's mind.</i>

463
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:07,231
Hm. So, we should probably
just be a few hours.

464
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:10,240
Oh my God...
and you!

465
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:13,539
And your whole Valedictorian
thing and the making us proud.

466
00:30:13,611 --> 00:30:16,273
<i>Oh, God. Congratulatlons.</i>

467
00:30:16,347 --> 00:30:19,839
Yay! H m. Bye-bye.

468
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,451
What...?

469
00:30:26,424 --> 00:30:27,448
Hey!

470
00:30:27,525 --> 00:30:29,254
Hey.

471
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:32,626
<i>Dude, how many of
these things are there?</i>

472
00:30:32,697 --> 00:30:34,756
There's three children.

473
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:37,131
<i>This is Reagan,
and Jenna and Sam.</i>

474
00:30:37,202 --> 00:30:40,535
Hi, little girls,
my name's Sylvia.

475
00:30:41,906 --> 00:30:43,771
God! What the fuck?!

476
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:46,811
<i>Hey, do not say
those things...</i>

477
00:30:46,878 --> 00:30:48,937
Jesus! You
son of a bitch!

478
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:50,708
Hey.

479
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:52,249
Holy Mother of God!

480
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:53,682
Time for you
to leave, now!

481
00:30:53,751 --> 00:30:56,413
I didn't do
anything. God!

482
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:11,198
You keep driving,
bitch. You don't know me!

483
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:12,327
What?

484
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:30,414
<i>Hi, Mrs. Ford.
Is Angie here?</i>

485
00:31:30,488 --> 00:31:32,353
Yes.

486
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:38,659
Um. Do you think that maybe we could
come in and say hi to her real fast?

487
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:41,631
<i>Is that alright?</i>

488
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:58,538
Yeah, I was
totally...

489
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:06,756
<i>You're coming
with us, right Angie?</i>

490
00:32:06,824 --> 00:32:08,815
I'm sorry. Are
you talking to me?

491
00:32:08,893 --> 00:32:10,861
Yeah. You're
coming with us, right?

492
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,487
No fucking way.

493
00:32:12,563 --> 00:32:14,690
<i>- No, you have to come with us.
- I need you.</i>

494
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,530
Okay? I'm gonna hook up with
someone. I'm gonna hook up.

495
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:19,968
You don't need us.
Just wear your underwear.

496
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:22,336
Bitch.

497
00:32:25,209 --> 00:32:26,233
Rahhhrr.

498
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:32,582
<i>So, are your
parents mad</i>

499
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:34,675
'cause you missed
last day of school?

500
00:32:34,752 --> 00:32:38,313
<i>No, they're trying to get over
last 1000 days she's missed school.</i>

501
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:41,654
I have A's on all my exams, they
know I'm gonna graduate anyways.

502
00:32:41,726 --> 00:32:44,320
Well, it's called
attendance, smart ass.

503
00:32:44,395 --> 00:32:48,957
<i>Oh my God, please attendance should
be applied on a basis only situation.</i>

504
00:32:49,033 --> 00:32:51,661
I get good grades.
I get perfect grades.

505
00:32:51,736 --> 00:32:53,795
Why does it even
matter if I'm in class?

506
00:32:53,871 --> 00:32:55,566
Don't you wanna
see your friends?

507
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,870
You bitches
all come to me!

508
00:32:57,942 --> 00:33:02,003
Okay, shit head, why don't you go to school
'cause that's the way real life works.

509
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,240
And you're a part of it.

510
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:04,576
I don't
like real life.

511
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:06,139
<i>Mrs. Ford
Angie.</i>

512
00:33:06,217 --> 00:33:08,185
What do you want?
Don't come in.

513
00:33:08,252 --> 00:33:11,779
<i>Your father and I are not exactly
happy about you having friends over.</i>

514
00:33:11,856 --> 00:33:14,017
Oh, it's okay. We'll
be gone soon anyway.

515
00:33:14,092 --> 00:33:17,027
<i>Are you planning
on leaving, Angie?</i>

516
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,096
Mom. Does it
really matter?

517
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:26,602
Of course it matters.

518
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:29,663
You know your father and I want
to have a serious discussion

519
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:31,936
about how things
are going to be...

520
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,877
I have friends over right
now. Can't we talk later?

521
00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:39,815
<i>Yes. Look, you were grounded
until we've worked things out.</i>

522
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,420
If I feel like I wanna
go out with my friends

523
00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:48,289
then I'm going to. And if you keep
bugging me about it then I definitely will.

524
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:53,661
You're only 14 and you
don't even go to school!

525
00:33:53,731 --> 00:33:55,722
You're growing
up too fast.

526
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:59,600
<i>Compared to the 1700's where children
were forced to work In factories?</i>

527
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:02,230
<i>Wait. No. You must be
comparing me to the 1970s</i>

528
00:34:02,306 --> 00:34:05,707
when you were a teenager, but weird
because last time that I checked

529
00:34:05,777 --> 00:34:10,043
my generation is less likely to smoke, drink,
do drugs, commit a crime, get pregnant,

530
00:34:10,114 --> 00:34:12,344
or drop out of high
school. God, that's weird

531
00:34:12,417 --> 00:34:15,978
and I don't have time to explain the
gap in between, but peace and love.

532
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:18,249
<i>- How can you...
- I am your mother!</i>

533
00:34:18,322 --> 00:34:19,687
Duh.

534
00:34:23,327 --> 00:34:25,557
So...

535
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,257
<i>Dad?</i>

536
00:34:27,331 --> 00:34:30,198
Is anything wrong?

537
00:34:30,268 --> 00:34:33,064
No.

538
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:35,332
<i>Dawn and I are picking
up Brianne and Stacey</i>

539
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:37,966
and then we're probably
gonna go out for the night.

540
00:34:38,042 --> 00:34:39,669
Okay. Love you.

541
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:42,611
<i>I want you to sleep at
home. And I love you, too.</i>

542
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,705
What?

543
00:34:44,782 --> 00:34:49,617
Dad, no. I've already, like, decided that
I was gonna sleep at Stacey's or wherever.

544
00:34:49,687 --> 00:34:51,985
<i>It's the first
night of summer.</i>

545
00:34:52,056 --> 00:34:54,650
I don't want you guys to
force me to drink and drive.

546
00:34:54,725 --> 00:34:56,989
Then just don't drink. There you go.

547
00:34:57,061 --> 00:34:59,996
<i>You're not In your bed In the
morning, we've got problems.</i>

548
00:35:00,064 --> 00:35:01,964
You just don't
understand anything.

549
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:04,968
Right. I'm just trying
to ruin your life.

550
00:35:06,704 --> 00:35:10,003
<i>And Julia, would you
please talk to your sister?</i>

551
00:35:10,074 --> 00:35:14,909
I really need you to stay
home tonight. It's important.

552
00:35:14,979 --> 00:35:16,173
Please.

553
00:35:17,348 --> 00:35:18,975
<i>Love you.</i>

554
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:23,452
I know...

555
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:25,148
<i>Excuse me,
can you knock?</i>

556
00:35:25,223 --> 00:35:27,123
Excuse me, can
you suck my ass?

557
00:35:27,191 --> 00:35:32,254
Julia! What are you even doing in
my room, you stupid bitch, get out!

558
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,899
So, what are
you doing later?

559
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:39,164
Holly and Lighty have Holly's
mom's car. I might go out with 'em.

560
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:41,102
Since when did
Holly get a license?

561
00:35:41,172 --> 00:35:44,608
<i>Julia. Shut up!
Do you have any weed?</i>

562
00:35:44,675 --> 00:35:46,666
<i>No. Sorry.</i>

563
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:50,544
Mom and dad look like they're about
to kill themselves. Stay home tonight.

564
00:35:50,615 --> 00:35:51,946
Are you staying at Pete's?

565
00:35:52,016 --> 00:35:54,917
Would you please
just stay home?

566
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:58,444
Give me some
weed and maybe I will.

567
00:35:58,523 --> 00:36:01,856
Can we borrow
some weed? Please?

568
00:36:01,926 --> 00:36:04,827
Get us some
later. Come on.

569
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:06,830
Fine.

570
00:36:06,898 --> 00:36:10,629
You better make sure that we get it
from Mod, not his creepy older brother

571
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:11,793
or I'll shoot myself.

572
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:13,564
Why?

573
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:16,163
<i>He's a pervert and
he's obsessed wlth me.</i>

574
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,798
And he's really old.

575
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:19,843
Okay. Sweet.

576
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:22,277
Alright.
You're dismissed.

577
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:24,837
Love you.
Good bye.

578
00:36:24,916 --> 00:36:26,474
Bitch.

579
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:29,486
Oh.

580
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:04,013
So, what have
you been doing?

581
00:37:04,088 --> 00:37:06,249
Nothing.

582
00:37:06,324 --> 00:37:08,485
Then why did you leave?

583
00:37:12,029 --> 00:37:16,125
What's up?

584
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:19,862
You're headed
to my house?

585
00:37:19,937 --> 00:37:22,303
I'm gonna pick
up your girl.

586
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:24,204
That's my house.

587
00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:26,539
<i>You ain't paying
no bills.</i>

588
00:37:26,611 --> 00:37:27,669
Ou!

589
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,303
What?

590
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:33,578
Alright. Well, um

591
00:37:33,651 --> 00:37:34,709
so we gotta go.

592
00:37:34,785 --> 00:37:37,379
Maybe we'll
see you later.

593
00:37:37,455 --> 00:37:39,650
Yeah, maybe.

594
00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:43,455
<i>Wait a second, I'm gonna roll
with them. Gotta get my beak wet.</i>

595
00:37:43,527 --> 00:37:46,121
Alright. I'll off to
the races, son.

596
00:37:46,197 --> 00:37:48,631
Hey, Zack.
Eat this.

597
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:57,869
What up, kids?

598
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:59,409
<i>Hi, Eddie.</i>

599
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:03,208
Julia. What the
hell was that?

600
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:04,805
What?

601
00:38:04,882 --> 00:38:07,112
<i>Don't give me that.
You and Dylan.</i>

602
00:38:07,184 --> 00:38:09,846
<i>Hello, I have a
boyfriend, actually.</i>

603
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,219
Okay, hello, and so does
your best friend Stacey.

604
00:38:14,825 --> 00:38:16,986
<i>Remember Dylan Is
Stacey's boyfriend?</i>

605
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:22,829
<i>Believe It or not some people
actually do flirt once and a while.</i>

606
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:26,199
Well, what's that
supposed to mean?

607
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:28,761
When was the last time
you hooked up with anyone?

608
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:30,739
Just give me break, man.

609
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:36,803
<i>Oh, Stacey, Stacey.</i>

610
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:38,143
Mom, stay there.

611
00:38:38,215 --> 00:38:39,978
Hi, girls! There's
a boy in the car.

612
00:38:40,051 --> 00:38:42,110
<i>Clark Gable,
I could say.</i>

613
00:38:42,186 --> 00:38:45,883
No, mom, you can't say anything
at all, you're an alien.

614
00:38:45,956 --> 00:38:49,084
<i>Oh my God,
how embarrassing.</i>

615
00:38:50,961 --> 00:38:54,021
I think I wanna
hook up with Mod.

616
00:38:54,098 --> 00:38:55,565
Ha!

617
00:38:55,633 --> 00:38:58,101
Are you bastards ready
to get wasted tonight?

618
00:38:58,169 --> 00:38:59,568
Because I am.

619
00:38:59,637 --> 00:39:01,935
My boyfriend just uses
me as a body to bang

620
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:04,998
and then he just ditches me
right afterwards

621
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:06,805
Isn't that so funny?

622
00:39:06,877 --> 00:39:10,608
So, anyway, Mod said for us to meet
him at the park to pick up weed.

623
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:11,739
Hey, Eddie.

624
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:13,511
Hey.

625
00:39:13,584 --> 00:39:16,246
What's it gonna take
for you to leave him?

626
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,117
What if he was
cheating on you?

627
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:19,781
Real subtie, Julia.

628
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:21,256
I'd leave him.

629
00:39:21,325 --> 00:39:23,725
You should check his
pager when he's sleeping.

630
00:39:23,794 --> 00:39:27,252
I haven't found a way or a reason
or an opportunity to leave him yet.

631
00:39:27,331 --> 00:39:29,128
When I do that, I will.

632
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,997
I can think
of many reasons.

633
00:39:31,068 --> 00:39:33,195
Okay. I don't
wanna talk about it.

634
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:38,230
You know it's a lot harder to leave
someone that it seems. Like you know that.

635
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:40,004
You know what, Brianne?

636
00:39:40,077 --> 00:39:43,240
Stacey really needs to just
go fuck some really hot ass guy

637
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:45,839
so Dylan can realize what
he has and appreciate it.

638
00:39:45,916 --> 00:39:48,009
You know what, Dawn?

639
00:39:48,085 --> 00:39:49,416
Go find your hunk...

640
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:51,250
I'm right here.
I'm right here.

641
00:39:51,322 --> 00:39:53,756
<i>Uh uh, what she should
do Is find another guy.</i>

642
00:39:53,824 --> 00:39:55,587
That way she
can make a choice.

643
00:39:55,659 --> 00:39:58,253
<i>You've been dating
Pete for three years</i>

644
00:39:58,329 --> 00:40:01,025
during which you claimed you
haven't even liked the guy.

645
00:40:01,098 --> 00:40:02,725
So I wouldn't
talk if I were you.

646
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,462
Phew, I love girls.

647
00:40:05,536 --> 00:40:06,833
Julia, look out.

648
00:40:14,879 --> 00:40:17,439
<i>I pissed myself.</i>

649
00:40:17,515 --> 00:40:20,143
<i>God, Eddie,
It's disgusting.</i>

650
00:40:20,217 --> 00:40:22,208
Okay, no thanks.

651
00:40:22,286 --> 00:40:24,220
Yeah, I think
I'll pass.

652
00:40:24,288 --> 00:40:27,780
Oh, no.

653
00:40:27,858 --> 00:40:30,452
Oh, my
goodness. Hi.

654
00:40:30,528 --> 00:40:31,927
Hi.

655
00:40:31,996 --> 00:40:33,361
<i>Yoo- hoo!</i>

656
00:40:34,965 --> 00:40:36,796
She's completely
destroyed.

657
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,938
So what have you
guys been doing?

658
00:40:42,006 --> 00:40:43,530
Ah!

659
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:47,506
Why don't we go
to the back yard?

660
00:40:47,578 --> 00:40:49,978
Hey, can I um,
use your bathroom?

661
00:40:50,047 --> 00:40:52,208
Yeah. Of course,
it's down the hall.

662
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:56,014
Come on.

663
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,548
What...

664
00:41:39,196 --> 00:41:42,996
What is that whole Mod
thing about you, asshole?

665
00:41:43,067 --> 00:41:46,002
People are starting
to get suspicious, man.

666
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:48,595
Did you hear what Julia
said earlier in the car?

667
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:50,833
I think she started
to suspect something.

668
00:41:50,908 --> 00:41:54,810
You're so fucking paranoid. We've
kept it all a secret for this long.

669
00:41:54,879 --> 00:41:58,781
I am so tired
of living in secret.

670
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:01,716
I can't even keep my
head on straight right now.

671
00:42:01,785 --> 00:42:05,186
I'm the one who said we should
tell people if we wanted to.

672
00:42:05,256 --> 00:42:09,659
Shh. Shut up.
Just shut up.

673
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:15,029
God, you know damn well why I don't
want anybody to know about this shit.

674
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:19,468
You just don't
fucking get it.

675
00:42:32,316 --> 00:42:36,343
<i>I can't actually remember when
spinning on a tire was so thrilling.</i>

676
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:38,615
How old were we when
we first started drugs?

677
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:41,249
<i>Can we not say the
D- R-U-G-S right now?</i>

678
00:42:41,325 --> 00:42:42,917
I really want
to get wasted.

679
00:42:42,993 --> 00:42:45,860
<i>Oh my God.</i>

680
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:48,990
<i>Where did you
get the shrooms?</i>

681
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:50,795
What's going on?

682
00:42:50,868 --> 00:42:54,964
Hey. We are babysitting young
children right now. Have you gone mad?

683
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:57,303
No, but I'm about to.

684
00:42:57,374 --> 00:43:00,639
<i>Hello? We were supposed to
do them together, remember?</i>

685
00:43:00,711 --> 00:43:02,508
You still have
yours. Eat 'em!

686
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,343
<i>I'll eat 'em.</i>

687
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:05,939
I think I might
want them.

688
00:43:06,016 --> 00:43:08,007
<i>You'd better
eat then now.</i>

689
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:11,486
If you don't eat them,
you're gonna be tripping.

690
00:43:11,555 --> 00:43:12,647
<i>All night.</i>

691
00:43:16,226 --> 00:43:18,786
<i>All by yourself.
All alone.</i>

692
00:43:18,862 --> 00:43:20,853
<i>Well, If I take
them right now,</i>

693
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:23,365
how long is it gonna
take for them to kick in?

694
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:25,163
<i>Are you kidding?</i>

695
00:43:25,235 --> 00:43:27,032
You've never
done shrooms before?

696
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:29,698
<i>No, I haven't I figured
I may as well try them</i>

697
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:31,866
with my best friends.
It's my graduation.

698
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:34,274
I will take them if
you don't want them.

699
00:43:34,345 --> 00:43:39,373
<i>Come on, Tori. Just do it. For the
first time In your life be Irresponsible.</i>

700
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:41,608
Do it.

701
00:43:41,685 --> 00:43:43,710
Do it. Do it. Do it.

702
00:43:47,758 --> 00:43:53,355
<i>Hey, you all. I'm gonna get picked up to
go to this kid's house, It's a big party.</i>

703
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:54,522
Okay-kay-kay.

704
00:43:54,598 --> 00:43:55,895
Who did you talk to?

705
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:57,024
Dylan's there.

706
00:43:57,101 --> 00:43:57,829
Dylan's there?

707
00:43:57,901 --> 00:43:58,595
I'm gonna go.

708
00:43:58,669 --> 00:43:59,363
Me too.

709
00:43:59,436 --> 00:44:01,301
Me three.

710
00:44:01,372 --> 00:44:04,341
<i>I wanna get really drunk.
I'm happy with a beer.</i>

711
00:44:04,408 --> 00:44:07,605
Right. But I'm rolling with
Riley. I'll meet you kids there.

712
00:44:07,678 --> 00:44:09,407
Why don't you roll with us?

713
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,643
Nosy. Riley and I gotta
take care of some things.

714
00:44:12,716 --> 00:44:14,650
Yo. Let me drink
this for you, girl.

715
00:44:17,187 --> 00:44:19,747
Ah! Shit! Phew!

716
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:20,881
<i>Yeah.</i>

717
00:44:20,958 --> 00:44:22,255
<i>Bye, Eddie.</i>

718
00:44:25,429 --> 00:44:27,454
Boy!

719
00:44:27,531 --> 00:44:28,896
Give it to me.

720
00:44:28,966 --> 00:44:31,457
Uh. Uh. Uh. Alright,
kid. Who you got for me?

721
00:44:31,535 --> 00:44:34,060
Who you got for me, man?
What are you talking about?

722
00:44:34,138 --> 00:44:35,628
Who you got for me?

723
00:44:35,706 --> 00:44:38,231
I'm a get your
beek wet later, Dog.

724
00:44:38,308 --> 00:44:42,870
Holly, Lighty, freshmen, fucking,
somebody's mom's car. I don't know.

725
00:44:42,946 --> 00:44:44,641
Dude, thank you
for hooking us up.

726
00:44:44,715 --> 00:44:47,013
Yo, don't even worry
about it. Let's do this.

727
00:44:50,454 --> 00:44:52,115
<i>Come on.</i>

728
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:54,714
Wanna drive?
Drive this. Get out.

729
00:44:54,792 --> 00:44:56,885
<i>Anything for
you, baby.</i>

730
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,427
Let's go!

731
00:44:58,495 --> 00:44:59,792
Hey, yeah!

732
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:01,353
<i>Woo-hoo!</i>

733
00:45:01,432 --> 00:45:04,924
<i>Hold on
to your panties.</i>

734
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:15,474
<i>Shit.</i>

735
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:21,478
<i>Talk to me, wassup?</i>

736
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:23,179
Why are you
rushing for it?

737
00:45:23,253 --> 00:45:27,917
When I'm talking to one of these
older chicks, what do I say?

738
00:45:27,991 --> 00:45:29,583
Oh, you don't
know what to say...

739
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:32,185
Uh, give us a second.

740
00:45:32,262 --> 00:45:37,529
Senior girls are a little bit smarter so
if you wanna tap that older ass tonight

741
00:45:37,601 --> 00:45:39,569
you gotta listen
to my rules, alright?

742
00:45:39,636 --> 00:45:45,131
First, give
'em the look.

743
00:45:45,209 --> 00:45:47,370
Yeah. Yeah.
Be smooth, alright?

744
00:45:47,444 --> 00:45:49,469
Listen first.
Make moves later.

745
00:45:49,546 --> 00:45:52,572
Let 'em know you're for real.
Take control of the situation.

746
00:45:52,649 --> 00:45:55,049
And be a little arrogant.
Girls love that shit.

747
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:59,055
Use some smooth little
one-liners. Um, like, uh...

748
00:46:00,958 --> 00:46:04,291
Hey, sweet milk,
Holla at your boy.

749
00:46:04,361 --> 00:46:06,386
Something like that.

750
00:46:06,463 --> 00:46:08,863
<i>Okay. Holla at your
boy, sweet milk.</i>

751
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:12,026
Ah! You got this
boy, let's do it.

752
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:16,004
<i>I'm gonna get you some
senior ass tonight, boy.</i>

753
00:46:17,207 --> 00:46:18,834
<i>Hi. Do I know you?</i>

754
00:46:18,909 --> 00:46:22,868
Hey, Holla at your boy, barbecue
sauce. That's how we do it.

755
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:24,140
Come on.

756
00:46:30,721 --> 00:46:32,245
Brianne.

757
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:37,218
Surprise!

758
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:38,318
Shit.

759
00:46:38,395 --> 00:46:39,726
You wanna dance?

760
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:41,094
Uh. No.

761
00:46:41,165 --> 00:46:44,396
Oh. Do you believe
in love at first sight?

762
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:47,733
This whole thing. I know,
I'm sorry, you've heard it.

763
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:49,363
<i>Damn it.</i>

764
00:46:49,439 --> 00:46:50,497
Bucket!

765
00:46:50,574 --> 00:46:52,166
Aw, shit!

766
00:46:52,242 --> 00:46:55,109
Yes, sir. You'd better
finish that drink, bitch.

767
00:46:55,179 --> 00:46:57,374
There are children
sober in India.

768
00:46:57,447 --> 00:46:59,142
M m. Ah!

769
00:46:59,216 --> 00:47:01,878
That's a good boy! That
one was for the kids.

770
00:47:01,952 --> 00:47:04,182
Beer and me,
friends for life. Ah!

771
00:47:04,254 --> 00:47:08,486
Aw, shit. Pete's doing that
thing that makes him fart again.

772
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:10,925
<i>Hey, Pete, hold
on one second.</i>

773
00:47:14,531 --> 00:47:16,829
Everybody in.
Come on, come on.

774
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:20,063
Alright. Ready?
Set? Go, bro.

775
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:26,339
<i>That's my
friend, right there.</i>

776
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:27,877
You didn't tell
me anything.

777
00:47:27,945 --> 00:47:30,175
Why are you being so fucking annoying?

778
00:47:30,247 --> 00:47:34,377
I need to
talk to you.

779
00:47:34,451 --> 00:47:36,476
<i>Hey, asshole!</i>

780
00:47:37,654 --> 00:47:40,452
You're the
shit, bro. Yeah!

781
00:47:42,292 --> 00:47:45,318
<i>We're out of toilet paper.</i>

782
00:47:45,395 --> 00:47:49,957
<i>Can somebody help me?
I need toilet paper!</i>

783
00:47:51,501 --> 00:47:53,059
So what have
you been doing?

784
00:47:53,136 --> 00:47:56,970
Don't worry
about it. Damn.

785
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:00,771
I don't think I should
be treated like this.

786
00:48:00,844 --> 00:48:03,574
<i>You'd better start acting
like I'm your girlfriend.</i>

787
00:48:03,647 --> 00:48:05,615
And not just some girl you come home to.

788
00:48:14,191 --> 00:48:15,681
Who sent you this?

789
00:48:15,759 --> 00:48:17,989
How the hell would I know, you got it.

790
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:20,825
Apparently someone wants
to know if you want to fuck.

791
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:23,628
Shut up, it don't
say that. Fu...

792
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:24,724
<i>Brianne!</i>

793
00:48:24,801 --> 00:48:25,927
I hate you.

794
00:48:26,003 --> 00:48:27,527
I love you.

795
00:48:29,706 --> 00:48:34,734
<i>Oh, Have you guys seen Brianne? I've
not seen her once since we came In.</i>

796
00:48:34,811 --> 00:48:36,540
Excuse me.

797
00:48:36,613 --> 00:48:39,844
I'm gonna go find someone who's
mature and who likes me for me.

798
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:43,546
And not just for my house
and my turkey sandwiches.

799
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:46,851
And my flower.

800
00:49:06,043 --> 00:49:08,238
I fucked that
chick like two weeks ago.

801
00:49:08,312 --> 00:49:09,802
That's Dylan's girlfriend.

802
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,677
Must've been
somebody else then.

803
00:49:11,748 --> 00:49:17,084
<i>Class of 199-fucking-9.</i>

804
00:49:17,154 --> 00:49:19,645
<i>Man this is
lame, '99, '93.</i>

805
00:49:19,723 --> 00:49:22,248
What's the shit,
I mean, it's crazy.

806
00:49:22,326 --> 00:49:25,693
Spinning crazy. Crazy,
crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy.

807
00:49:25,762 --> 00:49:27,593
So what does that mean?

808
00:49:27,664 --> 00:49:31,225
<i>Graduation day, right? So after
we broke a few school windows</i>

809
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:33,792
and tied up Professor
Fuck-My-Face's car

810
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:35,861
<i>I was In my place
to smoke a jay, right?</i>

811
00:49:35,939 --> 00:49:38,737
Then Jamie comes over,
and she comes over,

812
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:41,073
but I'm trying to
bang her all year.

813
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:43,009
And she comes over
and she's balling.

814
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:46,106
<i>And she even tells me couple of
days about this friend of hers</i>

815
00:49:46,183 --> 00:49:50,142
uh, uh, Allie,
who was a Russian spy

816
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:53,485
<i>Okay, and like, you know,
ding-dong, a little bell running.</i>

817
00:49:53,557 --> 00:49:56,219
Next thing you know Allie
pulls out a Smith and Wesson

818
00:49:56,293 --> 00:49:58,523
and starts waving
around speaking Russian.

819
00:49:59,763 --> 00:50:02,527
I grab, uh, I got
my lucky knife.

820
00:50:02,599 --> 00:50:04,897
<i>I got my fucking knife
I'm gonna do something.</i>

821
00:50:04,968 --> 00:50:08,233
I was gonna do something
but I don't have to.

822
00:50:08,305 --> 00:50:10,796
Get me what he's
smoking.

823
00:50:10,874 --> 00:50:14,605
Smoke. Drink.
Don't think.

824
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:17,476
Hey, douchebag.
Eat me.

825
00:50:19,383 --> 00:50:22,716
<i>Uh. Yo smoking grass</i>

826
00:50:22,786 --> 00:50:26,745
Gives a little laugh, we want
your ass 'cause I'm about to blast.

827
00:50:26,823 --> 00:50:30,384
And I'm about to have a good
time Grab some titties and ass.

828
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:33,918
<i>It's all on the same run Everybody
knows what's coming outta my mind.</i>

829
00:50:33,997 --> 00:50:36,864
<i>But I breathe so fast
I can't leave these words.</i>

830
00:50:36,933 --> 00:50:39,902
<i>Trees, trees, I smoke trees I roll weed</i>

831
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:09,828
Hey, sweet milk

832
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:13,632
What?

833
00:51:19,509 --> 00:51:21,500
I'm Riley.

834
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:24,638
I'm sorry.
I'm such a mess.

835
00:51:24,714 --> 00:51:26,909
Oh.

836
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:37,060
Beer.

837
00:51:44,634 --> 00:51:47,933
<i>That's all I wanted.</i>

838
00:51:48,004 --> 00:51:49,733
I just became a senior.

839
00:51:51,475 --> 00:51:55,138
And I just can't keep on
living my life like this

840
00:51:55,212 --> 00:51:57,476
and still have respect
for myself, you know?

841
00:51:57,547 --> 00:52:00,880
<i>I wake up
every single morning</i>

842
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:04,944
and I tell myself that
today's gonna be different

843
00:52:05,021 --> 00:52:08,889
I'm not gonna be
mistreated by, like,

844
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:11,189
anyone.

845
00:52:12,863 --> 00:52:16,162
And then I go through
my day and I come home

846
00:52:16,233 --> 00:52:18,895
and everything
starts right back

847
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:21,460
where it left off.

848
00:52:21,538 --> 00:52:24,063
I think you should
come home with me.

849
00:52:31,181 --> 00:52:33,081
Hey, guys. Hi.

850
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:36,586
Hey, thanks for inviting me to smoke
with you. It's great. It's nice.

851
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:37,677
Hi, Brianne.

852
00:52:37,754 --> 00:52:39,551
Hi, Dawn.

853
00:52:39,623 --> 00:52:42,456
<i>I called your name.
'Cause I wasn't gonna smoke.</i>

854
00:52:42,526 --> 00:52:45,654
There's a lot of smoke and I've
always got it, so, stick with me.

855
00:52:45,729 --> 00:52:47,526
Thanks, but I'd
rather kill myself.

856
00:52:47,597 --> 00:52:49,292
Oh.

857
00:52:49,366 --> 00:52:54,497
You're just... Do you know how I
feel about you? You're so feisty.

858
00:52:54,571 --> 00:52:57,506
Hey, Brianne. Here's that
tampon that you really needed.

859
00:52:57,574 --> 00:53:00,566
Remember? Can I talk to
you alone for one second?

860
00:53:02,112 --> 00:53:04,046
<i>Hey, Zack, I have
your tampon.</i>

861
00:53:04,114 --> 00:53:05,672
That's nasty.

862
00:53:05,749 --> 00:53:08,343
I thought that whole you
and Mod was just bullshit.

863
00:53:08,418 --> 00:53:12,684
Dawn, you've been my best friend
for like a gazillion years.

864
00:53:12,756 --> 00:53:15,224
<i>But this has got too
way out of control.</i>

865
00:53:15,292 --> 00:53:16,919
It drives me crazy

866
00:53:16,993 --> 00:53:20,224
when you flirt with Mod right
in front of my face, you asshole.

867
00:53:20,297 --> 00:53:22,663
I was just
smoking a blunt.

868
00:53:22,732 --> 00:53:26,031
I saw what you
were doing.

869
00:53:26,102 --> 00:53:28,593
Let's just all have
a good night, okay?

870
00:55:45,775 --> 00:55:48,437
<i>Come on.</i>

871
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:51,105
<i>Fuck it, the light.</i>

872
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:53,945
<i>Ah I Fuck.</i>

873
00:55:58,888 --> 00:56:02,722
Um, uh, What... What the
hell is the matter with you?

874
00:56:02,792 --> 00:56:04,919
Put this on. What's wrong with you?

875
00:56:04,994 --> 00:56:08,953
Is that the way you wanna flash those
perverts? You didn't even get to know 'em.

876
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:10,260
Young, how
old are you?

877
00:56:10,333 --> 00:56:12,460
I'm old enough.

878
00:56:12,535 --> 00:56:16,096
Old enough for what? What
are you trying to prove?

879
00:56:16,172 --> 00:56:19,573
<i>Don't get caught up being so hot
you forget to be a real person.</i>

880
00:56:19,642 --> 00:56:21,075
You think I'm hot?

881
00:56:22,946 --> 00:56:25,176
<i>Come on, you said you love young girls.</i>

882
00:56:25,248 --> 00:56:28,615
I care about younger girls but
don't believe what I say to the guys.

883
00:56:28,685 --> 00:56:29,743
What?

884
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:37,057
Uh, hey, hey, I'm gonna be
famous some day, You know that?

885
00:56:37,127 --> 00:56:40,528
Hey, some people are just born for
stardom and I'm just one of them.

886
00:56:40,597 --> 00:56:44,863
<i>What can I say?
My charm's a felony.</i>

887
00:56:44,934 --> 00:56:46,834
Alright.

888
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:47,927
Are we cool?

889
00:56:48,004 --> 00:56:49,528
Yeah.

890
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:59,872
Is Bailey coming here?

891
00:56:59,949 --> 00:57:01,439
Son of a shit.

892
00:57:01,518 --> 00:57:04,453
Get your clothes on.
I forgot. Come on.

893
00:57:04,521 --> 00:57:06,853
Come on, come on.
Make moves, make moves.

894
00:57:08,291 --> 00:57:10,259
Hey, I'm gonna roll
with you guys, man.

895
00:57:10,326 --> 00:57:12,726
I don't wanna even
be near Felix, man.

896
00:57:12,796 --> 00:57:14,593
Now why don't you
like your brother?

897
00:57:14,664 --> 00:57:17,531
Because his brother is
a pedophile, I'm convinced.

898
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:18,862
<i>He'll bitch at me...</i>

899
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:22,063
Alright. Roll
with us. Let's go.

900
00:57:29,045 --> 00:57:30,876
Yo, guys, um

<i>It's cool If you wanna be
smoking and drinking while I drive</i>

902
00:57:35,051 --> 00:57:38,350
it's totally illegal, but,
I mean, it's cool, right?

903
00:57:38,421 --> 00:57:40,150
You're such a bitch.

You know what? We need to
do some more illegal shit.

907
00:57:50,333 --> 00:57:52,426

00:59:09,412 --> 00:59:10,470
<i>Yeah!</i>

936
00:59:12,181 --> 00:59:16,914
What in God's
name was that?

937
00:59:16,986 --> 00:59:20,478
I'm sure it's just
good friends of ours.

938
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:24,288
Vandalizing, probably.

939
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:33,528
Oh, yeah.

940
00:59:33,603 --> 00:59:39,667
Oh my Jesus, you just
gave me the best idea ever.

941
00:59:39,742 --> 00:59:42,040
Oh, God.

942
00:59:42,111 --> 00:59:46,810
Get ready,
for awesome.

943
01:00:14,978 --> 01:00:17,003
Sylvia.

944
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:19,844
Do you think this music might
wake all the kids back up?

945
01:00:19,916 --> 01:00:22,749
Wait. I have to know this.

946
01:00:22,819 --> 01:00:27,449
<i>Did the movie The Matrix
actually come out of reality</i>

947
01:00:27,523 --> 01:00:30,890
or did I just make that
whole thing up in my head?

948
01:00:33,329 --> 01:00:36,787
Dude, I don't know, I just can't
stop thinking about pink lemonade.

949
01:00:40,870 --> 01:00:42,360
Sylvia.

950
01:00:42,438 --> 01:00:43,370
What?

951
01:00:43,439 --> 01:00:46,101
Let's talk to each other.

952
01:00:46,175 --> 01:00:48,336
Here I come.

953
01:00:48,411 --> 01:00:51,847
Okay.

954
01:00:51,914 --> 01:00:57,113
Here I am.

955
01:00:57,186 --> 01:01:00,280
I'm scared to leave home.

956
01:01:00,356 --> 01:01:03,553
There's no such thing as
home. It's all just an idea.

957
01:01:03,626 --> 01:01:05,753
I promise.

958
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:08,319
You know
what I mean.

959
01:01:08,398 --> 01:01:10,389
Like,

960
01:01:10,466 --> 01:01:14,527
the comfort and familiarity of
what home is to me right now.

961
01:01:14,604 --> 01:01:17,095
<i>This home that
you think Is home</i>

962
01:01:17,173 --> 01:01:19,971
is really just
the first one.

963
01:01:20,043 --> 01:01:22,273
<i>It's like we
have this family</i>

964
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:24,836
and we go off
and we do stuff

965
01:01:24,914 --> 01:01:28,941
and eventually we start
ourselves a new family

966
01:01:29,018 --> 01:01:33,978
<i>and then our family wlll go
off and start more families.</i>

967
01:01:34,057 --> 01:01:38,619
And really it's just like
this whole chain reaction

968
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:41,027
of, like, creation

969
01:01:41,097 --> 01:01:44,225
<i>and we try to
classify It In stages</i>

970
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:47,997
so that we can find
comfort in where we're at.

971
01:01:48,071 --> 01:01:51,939
At that one particular moment in time.

972
01:01:52,008 --> 01:01:53,737
<i>And really,</i>

973
01:01:53,810 --> 01:01:56,301
there's no
such thing as time.

974
01:01:56,379 --> 01:02:01,976
And we're all just
walking, talking patterns.

975
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:06,147
Shh!

976
01:02:06,222 --> 01:02:07,689
I heard that, too.

977
01:02:07,757 --> 01:02:10,282
This place is a wreck.

978
01:02:10,359 --> 01:02:11,758
Should I go down there?

979
01:02:11,828 --> 01:02:12,852
No.

980
01:02:12,929 --> 01:02:14,021
It's all wet.

981
01:02:14,097 --> 01:02:15,428
What should I do?

982
01:02:15,498 --> 01:02:18,990
I'll soak it clean, so
you clean up real fast.

983
01:02:19,068 --> 01:02:22,299
And, I will
distract them.

984
01:02:22,371 --> 01:02:25,602
And then
Tom, when he...

985
01:02:25,675 --> 01:02:28,838
<i>Hello, hellooooooo.</i>

986
01:02:28,911 --> 01:02:31,038
Wooooooo.

987
01:02:32,615 --> 01:02:36,016
Wow, it is all so wonderful
to finally meet you.

988
01:02:37,854 --> 01:02:39,116
Oh.

989
01:02:39,188 --> 01:02:41,349
Mwah, mwah.

990
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:42,891
Oh! Yeah.

991
01:02:42,959 --> 01:02:45,894
Are the, uh,
children not sleeping?

992
01:02:45,962 --> 01:02:48,430
Oh, they most
certainly are!

993
01:02:48,498 --> 01:02:51,023
Yes, they are!
They love sleeping!

994
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:52,931
<i>They told me so!</i>

995
01:02:53,002 --> 01:02:55,869
<i>They said,
"I love sleeping. "</i>

996
01:02:55,938 --> 01:02:57,963
Sleep, sleep, sleep.

997
01:02:58,040 --> 01:02:59,974
<i>I want to sleep.</i>

998
01:03:00,042 --> 01:03:01,771
Wow.

999
01:03:01,844 --> 01:03:05,871
You smell legendary,
by the way.

1000
01:03:05,948 --> 01:03:08,917
What's this
music I'm hearing?

1001
01:03:11,387 --> 01:03:14,288
So, anyways, um...!

1002
01:03:14,357 --> 01:03:18,817
That was actually my
first time babysitting.

1003
01:03:18,895 --> 01:03:20,760
<i>You know kids.</i>

1004
01:03:20,830 --> 01:03:26,063
<i>And, um, I just wanna say that
I think It was like 9:00 o'clock</i>

1005
01:03:26,135 --> 01:03:27,500
Yeah.

1006
01:03:27,570 --> 01:03:29,470
<i>And I all of a sudden got this urge</i>

1007
01:03:29,539 --> 01:03:32,599
to just go murder
the kiddies, right?

1008
01:03:32,675 --> 01:03:35,166
<i>So believe It or not,</i>

1009
01:03:35,244 --> 01:03:38,543
I actually had to grip
the sides of your sofa

1010
01:03:38,614 --> 01:03:40,809
to keep me from
running into the kitchen

1011
01:03:40,883 --> 01:03:43,579
and grabbing a butcher
knife and just stabbing them

1012
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:45,484
Mr. And Mrs. Turner.

1013
01:03:45,555 --> 01:03:47,455
<i>Mister and Mister.</i>

1014
01:03:47,523 --> 01:03:50,981
<i>She's my friend Sylvia and I'm so
sorry you had to meet her. But...</i>

1015
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:52,118
I'm Sylvia.

1016
01:03:54,263 --> 01:03:57,596
<i>Everything's good and
wonderful. We gotta go. Good bye.</i>

1017
01:03:57,667 --> 01:03:59,328
Oh, we're
leaving. Oh, yeah.

1018
01:04:10,746 --> 01:04:11,872
Oh.

1019
01:04:11,948 --> 01:04:12,972
What?

1020
01:04:13,049 --> 01:04:14,573
<i>I don't know.</i>

1021
01:04:14,650 --> 01:04:19,349
Maybe these are really strong
shrooms or something, but...

1022
01:04:19,422 --> 01:04:22,755
I think there's a
goose back there.

1023
01:04:22,825 --> 01:04:24,315
Oh.

1024
01:04:31,901 --> 01:04:33,562
You wanna go to
that punk show?

1025
01:04:35,338 --> 01:04:37,898
<i>I want you
to understand.</i>

1026
01:04:37,974 --> 01:04:39,771
<i>Fucked. Fucked.</i>

1027
01:04:39,842 --> 01:04:42,436
<i>You left me.
Do you understand?</i>

1028
01:04:42,511 --> 01:04:46,106
I'm not happy. I drove around 40 blocks.

1029
01:04:46,182 --> 01:04:48,309
<i>Okay? 40 blocks.</i>

1030
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:50,579
<i>Come on, man.</i>

1031
01:04:50,653 --> 01:04:52,712
Hey.

1032
01:04:52,788 --> 01:04:55,154
Damn, we missed
the whole show?

1033
01:04:55,224 --> 01:04:57,283
I wish I had
your timing.

1034
01:04:57,360 --> 01:04:58,725
It sucked?

1035
01:04:58,794 --> 01:05:00,284
No.

1036
01:05:00,363 --> 01:05:01,591
It was
really good.

1037
01:05:01,664 --> 01:05:03,632
Everybody, that
was awesome.

1038
01:05:03,699 --> 01:05:06,930
Fucking great
that shit, man.

1039
01:05:07,003 --> 01:05:08,800
You rock, man.

1040
01:05:08,871 --> 01:05:11,465
<i>Hey, uh, did you bring
your friend Lighty?</i>

1041
01:05:11,540 --> 01:05:13,599
Hey, light this.

1042
01:05:13,676 --> 01:05:15,507
<i>What's up, you sliding?</i>

1043
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:17,443
I'm sliding,
mother fucker.

1044
01:05:19,315 --> 01:05:20,805
Guys, guys.

1045
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:22,911
There's a keg party.

1046
01:05:22,985 --> 01:05:24,247
Yes!

1047
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:26,311
Thank God. I'm so out of my damn mind.

1048
01:05:26,389 --> 01:05:29,051
This place would need some, actually.

1049
01:05:29,125 --> 01:05:31,616
I got something for you.

1050
01:05:31,694 --> 01:05:33,787
Oh, can you drive me by my house later?

1051
01:05:33,863 --> 01:05:36,127
<i>Sausage fest.</i>

1052
01:05:36,198 --> 01:05:37,529
What's up, bitch?

1053
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:38,658
Hoe.

1054
01:05:38,734 --> 01:05:40,395
Yo, bitch
what's up?

1055
01:05:40,469 --> 01:05:42,596
Hey, what do you want?

1056
01:05:42,672 --> 01:05:45,072
What, daddy? Staring
like there's a problem.

1057
01:05:45,141 --> 01:05:46,836
You're full of it.

1058
01:05:46,909 --> 01:05:48,308
<i>You ain't rough, man.</i>

1059
01:05:48,377 --> 01:05:50,174
What are they
fighting about?

1060
01:05:50,246 --> 01:05:53,340
So lame. What are they ever
fighting about? It's so stupid.

1061
01:05:53,416 --> 01:05:55,316
What the fuck
are you looking at?

1062
01:05:55,384 --> 01:05:56,817
<i>Go fuck yourself.</i>

1063
01:05:56,886 --> 01:05:58,410
<i>Go fuck myself?
You know what?</i>

1064
01:05:58,487 --> 01:06:01,183
I will do that. After I fuck
your sister and your momma.

1065
01:06:01,257 --> 01:06:02,417
At least we got mommas.

1066
01:06:02,491 --> 01:06:04,356
Hey, hey, wait.

1067
01:06:04,427 --> 01:06:06,395
<i>Not here,
man. Chill out.</i>

1068
01:06:06,462 --> 01:06:07,554
Bye, bitches.

1069
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:08,790
<i>We got spice.</i>

1070
01:06:08,864 --> 01:06:10,354
<i>We'll be there.</i>

1071
01:06:10,433 --> 01:06:12,094
What the fuck?
Ain't got my back?

1072
01:06:12,168 --> 01:06:14,966
Wh... What, I was, I-
I- was right here. What?

1073
01:06:15,037 --> 01:06:18,006
<i>We got these
mother fuckers.</i>

1074
01:06:18,074 --> 01:06:20,235
Sa...

1075
01:06:20,309 --> 01:06:21,936
<i>No, no, no. Hey.</i>

1076
01:06:22,011 --> 01:06:24,980
Hey, hey, man,
Do me a favor, Thomas.

1077
01:06:25,047 --> 01:06:27,538
Can you please send
young girl to get Bailey?

1078
01:06:27,616 --> 01:06:28,480
What?

1079
01:06:28,551 --> 01:06:29,540
Shut up.

1080
01:06:29,618 --> 01:06:32,587
Be brave.
He's nice, okay?

1081
01:06:32,655 --> 01:06:35,089
You're in the gang.

1082
01:06:42,732 --> 01:06:44,199
Hey.

1083
01:06:44,266 --> 01:06:45,597
Oh, hey.

1084
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:47,727
Hi.

1085
01:06:47,803 --> 01:06:51,364
Um, you guys
were really good.

1086
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:52,668
It was awesome.

1087
01:06:52,742 --> 01:06:54,107
Thanks for coming.

1088
01:06:54,176 --> 01:06:57,612
I was glad that you
came, I appreciate that.

1089
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:00,615
We sounded like shit.

1090
01:07:00,683 --> 01:07:04,244
I couldn't hear myself,
it was fucked up.

1091
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:06,345
Ridiculous.
We sounded like garbage.

1092
01:07:06,422 --> 01:07:09,016
Horrible.

1093
01:07:09,091 --> 01:07:13,687
Uh. Well, there's
this keg party tonight.

1094
01:07:13,763 --> 01:07:15,663
Yeah.

1095
01:07:15,731 --> 01:07:19,667
Um, you
should really come.

1096
01:07:19,735 --> 01:07:21,259
I don't know.

1097
01:07:21,337 --> 01:07:24,397
Like, big parties are
not really my scene.

1098
01:07:24,473 --> 01:07:26,236
You know, it's like...

1099
01:07:26,308 --> 01:07:29,505
And I gotta get up early and
take the van to the shop so

1100
01:07:29,578 --> 01:07:32,172
I probably shouldn't stay
up that late, you know?

1101
01:07:32,248 --> 01:07:37,948
Take the van to the shop? Oh, man.

1102
01:07:50,866 --> 01:07:52,993
<i>Ready to smoke
some week kids?</i>

1103
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:54,627
Blah!

1104
01:07:54,703 --> 01:07:56,500
<i>I've never used one
of those before.</i>

1105
01:07:56,572 --> 01:07:58,767
Just take this
and pull through that.

1106
01:07:58,841 --> 01:08:00,206
Pull and suck, baby.

1107
01:08:00,276 --> 01:08:02,870
<i>Shut up!
God.</i>

1108
01:08:02,945 --> 01:08:06,472
Ready? Your's ready? We got
to all pull at the same time.

1109
01:08:19,361 --> 01:08:21,454
So why don't
you like big parties?

1110
01:08:21,530 --> 01:08:22,656
Why don't you?

1111
01:08:22,731 --> 01:08:24,289
<i>I don't know.</i>

1112
01:08:24,366 --> 01:08:28,962
Oh, I guess, um, I don't
really like drinking that much.

1113
01:08:29,038 --> 01:08:30,733
Fag.

1114
01:08:30,806 --> 01:08:32,899
<i>It's always the same
thing, you go, drink,</i>

1115
01:08:32,975 --> 01:08:35,637
you, you know, you stay
around with the same people

1116
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:39,238
and then you do the same crap, you
know, and you go home to go to sleep.

1117
01:08:39,315 --> 01:08:40,407
Na-na.

1118
01:08:40,483 --> 01:08:42,280
All the
meaningless conversation

1119
01:08:42,351 --> 01:08:44,080
<i>Yeah, man.</i>

1120
01:08:44,153 --> 01:08:46,781
Meaningless conversations
may not be that bad.

1121
01:08:46,856 --> 01:08:50,758
<i>I graduated today and I never
talked to anyone In four years.</i>

1122
01:08:50,826 --> 01:08:52,851
And I'm a little sad.

1123
01:08:54,930 --> 01:08:56,761
That's so
depressing, dude.

1124
01:08:56,832 --> 01:08:58,663
Where does
he come from?

1125
01:08:58,734 --> 01:09:00,361
Jesus!

1126
01:09:00,436 --> 01:09:02,529
That was ridiculous.

1127
01:09:02,605 --> 01:09:06,041
A picture is worth
like a thousand words.

1128
01:09:06,108 --> 01:09:12,104
<i>That means he's talked with
probably, like, a million people.</i>

1129
01:09:12,181 --> 01:09:14,843
<i>No! Barf on
your ass! No!</i>

1130
01:09:14,917 --> 01:09:15,941
I liked that.

1131
01:09:16,018 --> 01:09:18,919
God damn
right you did.

1132
01:09:18,988 --> 01:09:21,479
Hey, I don't usually
say much either.

1133
01:09:21,557 --> 01:09:23,650
<i>Everybody thinks,
I'm like, this airhead</i>

1134
01:09:23,726 --> 01:09:26,286
but really, I just,

1135
01:09:26,362 --> 01:09:30,059
don't feel the need to talk unless
I have something meaningful to say.

1136
01:09:30,132 --> 01:09:32,896
<i>Oh, gag me
with a dick!</i>

1137
01:09:32,968 --> 01:09:36,597
I'm really sorry,
I can't stop him.

1138
01:09:36,672 --> 01:09:40,130
<i>You know what?
Fuck off, we're here.</i>

1139
01:09:40,209 --> 01:09:43,736
Leave my van now.
Get the fuck out.

1140
01:09:43,812 --> 01:09:45,677
<i>It's your party. Go.</i>

1141
01:09:45,748 --> 01:09:48,979
<i>I gotta take care of some business.
He's going with you, right?</i>

1142
01:09:49,051 --> 01:09:50,518
<i>Hey, yeah.</i>

1143
01:09:50,586 --> 01:09:52,645
<i>You enjoy
your little party.</i>

1144
01:09:52,721 --> 01:09:55,451
<i>We're gonna get some
cigarettes for you, Nancy pants.</i>

1145
01:09:55,524 --> 01:09:56,650
Get me cigarettes.

1146
01:09:56,725 --> 01:09:58,920
We'll be right back. Shit. Shit.

1147
01:09:58,994 --> 01:10:00,018
<i>Ah I</i>

1148
01:10:00,095 --> 01:10:01,187
<i>Fuck, man I</i>

1149
01:10:01,263 --> 01:10:03,697
Yo, slam that
door hard, alright?

1150
01:10:03,766 --> 01:10:05,597
Alright, ready?

1151
01:10:05,668 --> 01:10:07,727
That is a piece.

1152
01:10:13,876 --> 01:10:18,203
Dylan!

1153
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:22,915
<i>Dylan.</i>

1154
01:10:26,088 --> 01:10:27,988
Hey.

1155
01:10:32,094 --> 01:10:33,891
Get off!

1156
01:10:33,963 --> 01:10:35,396
Want some?

1157
01:10:35,464 --> 01:10:36,829
I would love some.

1158
01:10:39,368 --> 01:10:42,303
Howdy, howdy.

1159
01:10:46,108 --> 01:10:47,973
Beer!

1160
01:10:48,043 --> 01:10:49,874
The best damn
drink in the world.

1161
01:10:49,945 --> 01:10:51,572
Yeah, yeah.

1162
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:55,606
Oh, man come on. You gotta get
over this not graduating thing

1163
01:10:55,684 --> 01:10:59,518
at least tonight, we've got kegs
here and they have your name on them.

1164
01:10:59,588 --> 01:11:03,718
Come on, we gotta party like
it's 1999 up in this bitch.

1165
01:11:03,792 --> 01:11:04,986
<i>Yeah I</i>

1166
01:11:05,060 --> 01:11:06,186
Thank you.

1167
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:07,854
Want to get wasted?

1168
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:10,296
By all means.

1169
01:11:10,366 --> 01:11:12,334
Oh, okay.

1170
01:11:12,401 --> 01:11:13,891
What have you got?

1171
01:11:13,969 --> 01:11:17,530
I got whatever
you need.

1172
01:11:17,606 --> 01:11:19,733
Hey.

1173
01:11:19,808 --> 01:11:21,275
Hey, how
are you?

1174
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:24,369
Uh... Um... Yeah,
you know what?

1175
01:11:24,446 --> 01:11:28,348
I'm actually gonna get some cigarettes,
like lots and lots of cigarettes.

1176
01:11:28,417 --> 01:11:30,180
Baby, I have a
pack right here.

1177
01:11:30,252 --> 01:11:33,050
<i>Uh, I don't like
that kind. Dawn I</i>

1178
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:35,852
H m.

1179
01:11:35,924 --> 01:11:38,620
I'll take it.

1180
01:11:38,694 --> 01:11:41,959
Man, if you just gotta shake
that one off, just go ahead, bro.

1181
01:11:42,031 --> 01:11:45,899
Do you wanna chill? Or do
you wanna chill with beer?

1182
01:11:47,903 --> 01:11:49,734
Alright. Who
should we prank call?

1183
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:53,536
Let's get
Stacey's mom.

1184
01:11:53,609 --> 01:11:55,236
Oh, dude.

1185
01:11:59,715 --> 01:12:02,275
Alright.
Hold it, hold it.

1186
01:12:02,351 --> 01:12:04,114
Uh-uh, uh-uh.

1187
01:12:07,089 --> 01:12:10,786
<i>Stacey, Stacey Is that you?</i>

1188
01:12:10,859 --> 01:12:15,159
Yes, it's me, ma.
And I am smacked.

1189
01:12:15,230 --> 01:12:17,164
<i>Stacey.</i>

1190
01:12:17,232 --> 01:12:19,826
Maybe you can tell about
the sound of my voice

1191
01:12:19,902 --> 01:12:23,599
That I am definitely a man!
And not your female daughter.

1192
01:12:23,672 --> 01:12:26,641
<i>I know who you are.</i>

1193
01:12:26,709 --> 01:12:30,167
Oh, do you now?
Shut up.

1194
01:12:30,245 --> 01:12:33,476
<i>You took my goosel Is
Stacey doing the funny stuff?</i>

1195
01:12:33,549 --> 01:12:37,849
<i>Is she? You put my Stacey on the phone
right now. Where Is my damn goose?</i>

1196
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:40,150
Ah! What?

1197
01:12:40,222 --> 01:12:43,385
What in the hell
was she talking about?

1198
01:12:43,459 --> 01:12:47,486
What... What
fucking goose, dude?

1199
01:12:47,563 --> 01:12:50,259
I don't know.

1200
01:12:50,332 --> 01:12:52,493
It could be
fucking that one.

1201
01:12:56,405 --> 01:12:58,896
<i>Excuse me.
What the fuck?</i>

1202
01:13:00,476 --> 01:13:02,535
Thank God they
didn't just stop.

1203
01:13:02,611 --> 01:13:06,240
<i>Yeah. I don't really want to
go to a keg party right now.</i>

1204
01:13:06,315 --> 01:13:08,579
Everybody's
reacting so weird.

1205
01:13:08,650 --> 01:13:14,486
<i>Should we just go lay down In that
nice grassy green field over there?</i>

1206
01:13:14,556 --> 01:13:19,425
Yes!

1207
01:13:19,495 --> 01:13:23,989
<i>Wow.</i>

1208
01:13:24,066 --> 01:13:27,866
<i>Except I think there's like
some army soldiers out there too.</i>

1209
01:13:34,676 --> 01:13:37,338
That's my boy. Now, come
on. Here comes round two.

1210
01:13:43,886 --> 01:13:47,754
Ah! Hi.
Hi. Hi. Hi. Hey.

1211
01:13:47,823 --> 01:13:49,017
Hey.

1212
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:51,184
Come here.
Concentrate.

1213
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:53,319
Quick question.

1214
01:13:53,395 --> 01:13:56,660
How bad
do you wanna fuck me?

1215
01:13:56,732 --> 01:13:58,632
Don't think.
Just answer.

1216
01:13:58,700 --> 01:13:59,792
Dawn!

1217
01:13:59,868 --> 01:14:02,166
Okay.

1218
01:14:02,237 --> 01:14:04,262
Yeah.

1219
01:14:04,339 --> 01:14:06,000
No?

1220
01:14:06,074 --> 01:14:06,972
No.

1221
01:14:07,042 --> 01:14:08,031
Oh, God.

1222
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:09,634
What?

1223
01:14:09,711 --> 01:14:11,770
<i>I'm sorry.
I don't understand.</i>

1224
01:14:11,847 --> 01:14:14,475
So what? I ain't telling
you every God damned thing.

1225
01:14:14,550 --> 01:14:16,017
Just be cool with me.

1226
01:14:16,084 --> 01:14:18,143
Man, fuck this.

1227
01:14:18,220 --> 01:14:21,018
You're right. Someone
should come in between them.

1228
01:14:21,089 --> 01:14:24,115
You know, someone's gotta
play sacrificial asshole and...

1229
01:14:24,193 --> 01:14:26,559
Well, uh...

1230
01:14:26,628 --> 01:14:28,755
<i>Rlley I</i>

1231
01:14:28,831 --> 01:14:33,131
Oh! I can't
believe you're here.

1232
01:14:33,202 --> 01:14:35,397
And look, I'm
even dried out.

1233
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:38,531
Oh, I liked
you all wet.

1234
01:14:38,607 --> 01:14:40,199
Holla.

1235
01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:42,909
I'm so happy
you came!

1236
01:14:42,978 --> 01:14:44,536
<i>Man, fuck you!</i>

1237
01:14:44,613 --> 01:14:48,071
Yeah, what
else is new?

1238
01:14:59,761 --> 01:15:03,595
Hey, so, uh...

1239
01:15:03,665 --> 01:15:07,294
It looks like little light
protectors and stars, you know,

1240
01:15:07,369 --> 01:15:10,930
they pierce
Straight through the sky.

1241
01:15:11,006 --> 01:15:13,839
And they spotlight
us, you know?

1242
01:15:13,909 --> 01:15:15,137
Yeah.

1243
01:15:15,210 --> 01:15:19,647
Oh! How mother
fucking sweet!

1244
01:15:19,715 --> 01:15:22,548
Oh, you kids
are so sweet.

1245
01:15:22,618 --> 01:15:24,313
See that?
You see that?

1246
01:15:24,386 --> 01:15:26,047
Okay. Alright.

1247
01:15:27,155 --> 01:15:28,850
Look at that.

1248
01:15:28,924 --> 01:15:32,155
Hey! Um,
can you not.

1249
01:15:32,227 --> 01:15:34,991
Alright.

1250
01:15:35,063 --> 01:15:37,463
See man, why you gotta be so punk?

1251
01:15:37,533 --> 01:15:39,660
Whoa!

1252
01:15:39,735 --> 01:15:41,532
I'm not.

1253
01:15:41,603 --> 01:15:42,661
What?

1254
01:15:42,738 --> 01:15:43,830
I'm actually normal.

1255
01:15:45,807 --> 01:15:48,674
<i>Everything we do at all
Is God coming through us.</i>

1256
01:15:48,744 --> 01:15:53,647
<i>So how am I smoking weed? God
obviously put It here to grow</i>

1257
01:15:53,715 --> 01:15:55,410
<i>on the Earth for us.</i>

1258
01:15:55,484 --> 01:15:58,476
Weed is proof

1259
01:15:58,554 --> 01:16:01,318
that God loves us and wants
us to be happy. Are you happy?

1260
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:02,516
I'm happy.

1261
01:16:02,591 --> 01:16:04,218
<i>Are you happy?</i>

1262
01:16:04,293 --> 01:16:06,056
<i>How many smoke weed?</i>

1263
01:16:06,128 --> 01:16:07,220
<i>No, how many?</i>

1264
01:16:07,296 --> 01:16:09,787
Let me tell you.

1265
01:16:09,865 --> 01:16:11,264
A lot.

1266
01:16:13,168 --> 01:16:14,692
Pass me the butt.

1267
01:16:14,770 --> 01:16:17,830
<i>You're messing up
the whole philosophy.</i>

1268
01:16:17,906 --> 01:16:22,400
Some of the kids, uh, something's
not right, something's wrong, uh,

1269
01:16:22,477 --> 01:16:24,502
something is,
uh, backwards.

1270
01:16:26,248 --> 01:16:27,738
<i>What do you mean?</i>

1271
01:16:27,816 --> 01:16:29,784
<i>Everything Is backwards.</i>

1272
01:16:29,851 --> 01:16:31,318
Smoke. Just
smoke. Come on.

1273
01:16:31,386 --> 01:16:33,047
There's something
in that, man.

1274
01:16:33,121 --> 01:16:35,055
But you're the one
that gave it to us.

1275
01:16:35,123 --> 01:16:37,489
I know, I know, I know,
Something's wrong.

1276
01:16:37,559 --> 01:16:41,723
<i>Don't touch It.!
gotta go to a hospital.</i>

1277
01:16:41,797 --> 01:16:43,788
Call a hospital.

1278
01:16:43,865 --> 01:16:45,264
Are you okay?

1279
01:16:45,334 --> 01:16:48,826
Yeah. Just
call... Just, um...

1280
01:16:50,772 --> 01:16:52,740
<i>Just Ignore him. He's...</i>

1281
01:16:52,808 --> 01:16:54,139
<i>Are you sure?</i>

1282
01:16:54,209 --> 01:16:56,177
Yeah. He gets
anxiety attacks.

1283
01:16:56,244 --> 01:17:00,271
Yeah, last week he thought
he was possessed by the devil.

1284
01:17:00,349 --> 01:17:02,909
<i>He hid In the attic
for like three hours.</i>

1285
01:17:02,985 --> 01:17:05,249
Ain't that great?

1286
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:07,413
AD H D to yourself, man!

1287
01:17:07,489 --> 01:17:09,354
Suck my
fucking AD H D dick.

1288
01:17:09,424 --> 01:17:11,392
<i>Oh, God.</i>

1289
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:13,655
Hey, man, I'm sorry.

1290
01:17:13,729 --> 01:17:18,223
Oh, oh, oh.
When I'm riding in my car

1291
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:19,892
Got my seat
on lean.

1292
01:17:19,968 --> 01:17:22,459
Hey, Felix. You alright
man, you need help up?

1293
01:17:22,537 --> 01:17:24,664
<i>When I'm at the house</i>

1294
01:17:27,109 --> 01:17:29,270
Oh. God!

1295
01:17:29,344 --> 01:17:31,505
Don't get all
emotional on us.

1296
01:17:31,580 --> 01:17:34,481
Pete, look at her, man. She's crying.

1297
01:17:34,549 --> 01:17:35,982
Don't cry.

1298
01:17:36,051 --> 01:17:37,712
I'm not crying!

1299
01:17:37,786 --> 01:17:39,913
Yes, you are.

1300
01:17:39,988 --> 01:17:43,754
Hey, guys, you know when you go to
the movies and you get to the sad part

1301
01:17:43,825 --> 01:17:45,793
and your eye
always starts to itch

1302
01:17:45,861 --> 01:17:50,628
but you can't scratch it because everybody
else is gonna think that you're crying.

1303
01:17:50,699 --> 01:17:53,167
Where do you
come from?

1304
01:17:53,235 --> 01:17:56,033
Man, everybody keeps
asking me that today.

1305
01:17:56,104 --> 01:18:02,065
Dude, remember that time when I was
wasted and we found that secret island?

1306
01:18:02,144 --> 01:18:05,079
That never happened.

1307
01:18:05,147 --> 01:18:07,513
Damn it.

1308
01:18:13,355 --> 01:18:16,813
Dude. Are you sure
that didn't happen?

1309
01:18:16,892 --> 01:18:19,986
It never happened.

1310
01:18:22,197 --> 01:18:24,165
Dude.

1311
01:18:24,232 --> 01:18:27,998
I feel so bad about being
so annoying. You know?

1312
01:18:28,070 --> 01:18:29,901
It's just so hard.

1313
01:18:29,971 --> 01:18:32,735
The more you pull away,
the more suffocating I get.

1314
01:18:32,808 --> 01:18:33,866
Shh.

1315
01:18:33,942 --> 01:18:35,739
I can't help it...

1316
01:18:35,811 --> 01:18:40,475
Please stop it, okay. We're gonna
try to have a normal night tonight.

1317
01:18:40,549 --> 01:18:43,017
Alright.

1318
01:18:43,085 --> 01:18:45,212
So I'm a cheerleader.

1319
01:18:45,287 --> 01:18:47,915
Oh, yeah?
That's hot.

1320
01:18:47,989 --> 01:18:52,426
Yeah, we, we practice more than
football and basketball players.

1321
01:18:52,494 --> 01:18:54,826
Combined.

1322
01:18:54,896 --> 01:18:57,922
You look like
you practice a lot.

1323
01:18:59,501 --> 01:19:02,197
This town sucks.

1324
01:19:02,270 --> 01:19:05,103
Yeah.

1325
01:20:00,562 --> 01:20:04,692
I'll be right there.

1326
01:20:04,766 --> 01:20:06,358
Damn, let's do this!

1327
01:20:06,434 --> 01:20:09,494
God damn.

1328
01:20:09,571 --> 01:20:11,562
Hang on. Wait, man.

1329
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:13,505
Come on, come on.

1330
01:20:13,575 --> 01:20:15,543
I got 'em!

1331
01:20:15,610 --> 01:20:17,908
<i>One, two, three, four.</i>

1332
01:20:17,979 --> 01:20:19,378
<i>One, two, three.</i>

1333
01:20:25,921 --> 01:20:27,183
Yeah?

1334
01:20:28,290 --> 01:20:30,383
It's Charles!

1335
01:20:30,458 --> 01:20:34,121
<i>Charlesl Charlesl</i>

1336
01:20:34,196 --> 01:20:35,857
Charles!

1337
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:40,597
Who the shit
is Charles?

1338
01:20:40,669 --> 01:20:43,103
Oh, it's Eddie's
piss-wasted alter ego.

1339
01:20:43,171 --> 01:20:47,733
Gimme that.
Gimme that.

1340
01:20:47,809 --> 01:20:48,867
Charles.

1341
01:20:51,813 --> 01:20:53,303
Sometimes it
gets violent.

1342
01:20:53,381 --> 01:20:56,077
What are you doing, man?
Are you wearing some panties?

1343
01:20:56,151 --> 01:21:00,247
I think you are. Why'd you let him
do that to you. You're a pussy, yo.

1344
01:21:00,322 --> 01:21:03,758
Yo, get the fuck outta
here. Yo, do your thing, man!

1345
01:21:03,825 --> 01:21:06,419
<i>Do your mother
fucking thing, Charles!</i>

1346
01:21:06,494 --> 01:21:08,826
What is he doing?

1347
01:21:08,897 --> 01:21:10,262
Ah!

1348
01:21:15,503 --> 01:21:17,471
<i>Who's that?</i>

1349
01:21:18,673 --> 01:21:20,607
<i>Oh, hell, no!</i>

1350
01:21:20,675 --> 01:21:22,438
Somebody's
called the boys.

1351
01:21:22,510 --> 01:21:24,705
Come on, let's go.
Let's fight these guys.

1352
01:21:26,615 --> 01:21:29,277
<i>Let's go and kick their
mother fucking asses.</i>

1353
01:21:29,351 --> 01:21:30,818
<i>Fight I Fight I</i>

1354
01:21:30,886 --> 01:21:33,116
<i>Come on, come on.</i>

1355
01:21:33,188 --> 01:21:35,656
Don't leave me.

1356
01:21:35,724 --> 01:21:38,022
<i>What do you want? Huh?</i>

1357
01:21:38,093 --> 01:21:41,324
I got a whole life right here.
I got a whole life right here.

1358
01:22:09,257 --> 01:22:13,318
Come on, baby. Kick his
ass for me. Take him down!

1359
01:22:27,008 --> 01:22:28,066
Bitch!

1360
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:46,120
Want some more?

1361
01:22:46,194 --> 01:22:47,354
Want some more?

1362
01:22:47,429 --> 01:22:50,364
What the fuck...?

1363
01:22:52,167 --> 01:22:54,601
Did you just see
Zack attack Biz?

1364
01:22:54,669 --> 01:22:56,603
That was awesome.

1365
01:23:28,003 --> 01:23:29,197
<i>It's Tupac!</i>

1366
01:23:29,270 --> 01:23:30,737
My man, Ponte!

1367
01:23:30,805 --> 01:23:32,295
<i>Who's Ponte?</i>

1368
01:23:32,374 --> 01:23:34,171
<i>That guy's In a gang.</i>

1369
01:23:34,242 --> 01:23:36,904
<i>Come on. Come on.</i>

1370
01:23:36,978 --> 01:23:38,741
Fuck West Po Homie.

1371
01:23:38,813 --> 01:23:40,440
What's going on?

1372
01:23:40,515 --> 01:23:42,779
<i>Come on, let's go.
We gotta get outta here.</i>

1373
01:23:42,851 --> 01:23:44,944
Is that my boy, Charles?

1374
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:47,614
I am. I am.

1375
01:23:47,689 --> 01:23:49,816
<i>Go have sex with
your mother, bitch.</i>

1376
01:23:49,891 --> 01:23:51,381
Take that.

1377
01:23:58,133 --> 01:23:59,998
It's like

1378
01:24:00,068 --> 01:24:03,333
you're supposed to be
starting the next big something

1379
01:24:03,405 --> 01:24:07,136
this upcoming millennium but I have
no clue what I should do with myself.

1380
01:24:07,208 --> 01:24:08,732
Make a difference.

1381
01:24:08,810 --> 01:24:11,438
Maybe the Y2K will
blow up the world.

1382
01:24:21,856 --> 01:24:23,687
<i>Go, come on. This way.</i>

1383
01:24:31,266 --> 01:24:32,790
<i>I'm, I'm proud of you.</i>

1384
01:24:32,867 --> 01:24:34,528
<i>My fucking jaw.</i>

1385
01:24:34,602 --> 01:24:37,662
My knees. I didn't get punched.
Because I used my knees. Yeah.

1386
01:24:37,739 --> 01:24:40,435
Fuck.

1387
01:24:40,508 --> 01:24:43,500
Man, I wanna know who in
the hell bitch-slapped me.

1388
01:24:43,578 --> 01:24:45,205
Man, I swear it
looked like Zack.

1389
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:48,374
No, man. Zack can't
even hold his own dick.

1390
01:24:48,450 --> 01:24:50,042
Hey, you
know what?

1391
01:24:50,118 --> 01:24:53,281
We should go to that
bitch Holly's house.

1392
01:24:53,354 --> 01:24:54,378
It's a ha-ha.

1393
01:24:55,590 --> 01:24:57,217
I'm just
gonna take off.

1394
01:24:57,292 --> 01:24:58,657
What?

1395
01:24:58,726 --> 01:25:00,387
How are we
gonna find a ride?

1396
01:25:00,462 --> 01:25:03,454
I don't know, but
I'm gonna go home.

1397
01:25:03,531 --> 01:25:05,294
What the...

1398
01:25:07,235 --> 01:25:09,169
<i>You're crazy.</i>

1399
01:25:09,237 --> 01:25:12,138
You see, the whole fight,
it was like nothing to me

1400
01:25:12,207 --> 01:25:15,005
I've been working
out a lot, wanna see?

1401
01:25:15,076 --> 01:25:16,168
You wanna feel them?

1402
01:25:16,244 --> 01:25:18,041
Yeah. Yeah.

1403
01:25:18,113 --> 01:25:20,775
Enough.

1404
01:25:25,019 --> 01:25:27,817
Are you gay?

1405
01:25:27,889 --> 01:25:31,518
Nah. Nah.

1406
01:25:31,593 --> 01:25:34,426
I just don't care.
You know?

1407
01:25:34,496 --> 01:25:36,293
About what?

1408
01:25:36,364 --> 01:25:40,391
Being like everybody
else, you know?

1409
01:25:40,468 --> 01:25:43,494
I love life
and I'm living it!

1410
01:25:43,571 --> 01:25:45,971
But Eddie
Style, though.

1411
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:47,064
Eddie Style.

1412
01:25:47,142 --> 01:25:48,609
It's a good style.

1413
01:25:48,676 --> 01:25:53,045
<i>You have to go after
what you want and get It I</i>

1414
01:25:53,114 --> 01:25:54,308
Am I right?

1415
01:25:54,382 --> 01:25:57,283
Dad says it's not
getting what you want

1416
01:25:57,352 --> 01:25:59,513
but wanting
what you've got.

1417
01:25:59,587 --> 01:26:02,112
Yeah? Well, your
dad didn't know shit.

1418
01:26:04,392 --> 01:26:07,293
Only you know
what you want.

1419
01:26:26,981 --> 01:26:29,472
Eddie. Where's Dylan?

1420
01:26:29,551 --> 01:26:31,985
Man, I don't know. Go
call the cops or something.

1421
01:26:32,053 --> 01:26:35,454
You're the one who called him out
of the woods and he never came back.

1422
01:26:35,523 --> 01:26:36,854
So where is he?

1423
01:26:36,925 --> 01:26:40,656
What were you guys
doing in the woods?

1424
01:26:40,728 --> 01:26:44,391
What? Why are you always taking
so many stupid ass pictures?

1425
01:26:44,465 --> 01:26:47,161
I mean, why? Why did you
just take a picture of me?

1426
01:26:47,235 --> 01:26:51,171
What is so great about this? What is
so fucking great about all this? Huh?

1427
01:27:23,838 --> 01:27:25,863
You're still here.

1428
01:27:25,940 --> 01:27:28,340
Yes.

1429
01:27:28,409 --> 01:27:31,435
Life sucks.

1430
01:27:31,512 --> 01:27:33,104
Yeah.

1431
01:28:31,172 --> 01:28:33,572
It's my
Mom's goose.

1432
01:28:43,818 --> 01:28:46,912
Let's break
into a boat.

1433
01:28:46,988 --> 01:28:50,549
Whatever's clever.

1434
01:28:50,625 --> 01:28:52,855
It's all you.

1435
01:28:52,927 --> 01:28:55,122
Let's do it.

1436
01:29:12,347 --> 01:29:14,815
You know we can't do
this forever, right?

1437
01:29:14,882 --> 01:29:15,974
I know.

1438
01:29:16,050 --> 01:29:17,312
Okay.

1439
01:29:17,385 --> 01:29:20,115
It's just that I never actually thought

1440
01:29:20,188 --> 01:29:22,588
about the reality
of that, you know?

1441
01:29:22,657 --> 01:29:24,284
Because I've
been so happy.

1442
01:29:24,359 --> 01:29:26,657
We have not
been so happy.

1443
01:29:26,728 --> 01:29:28,161
<i>Look,</i>

1444
01:29:28,229 --> 01:29:29,924
<i>the longer
that we do this</i>

1445
01:29:29,997 --> 01:29:33,455
the harder it's gonna be when the
inevitable eventually does come.

1446
01:29:33,534 --> 01:29:35,229
<i>Which It will.</i>

1447
01:29:35,303 --> 01:29:38,568
There's really just like no reason
for this shit to go any longer.

1448
01:29:38,639 --> 01:29:40,436
So being in love
isn't a reason?

1449
01:29:40,508 --> 01:29:43,966
<i>We would always have to hide
and that doesn't make any sense.</i>

1450
01:29:44,045 --> 01:29:45,672
We do not always
have to hide it.

1451
01:29:45,747 --> 01:29:47,510
Who gives a shit?

1452
01:29:47,582 --> 01:29:50,710
<i>What are you so scared of?
Why won't you give us a try?</i>

1453
01:29:50,785 --> 01:29:54,186
Because I can't handle what
that might end up meaning.

1454
01:30:45,006 --> 01:30:46,701
H m. I hate
you already.

1455
01:30:46,774 --> 01:30:49,265
<i>Hi, Angie, It's Stacey.
I'm in your neighborhood...</i>

1456
01:30:49,343 --> 01:30:51,504
<i>and I was just wondering,
Is your sister In?</i>

1457
01:30:51,579 --> 01:30:52,876
Did you drive
by my house?

1458
01:30:52,947 --> 01:30:54,414
Yeah, I did.

1459
01:30:54,482 --> 01:30:55,972
<i>Was her car
parked outside?</i>

1460
01:30:56,050 --> 01:30:57,074
No.

1461
01:30:57,151 --> 01:30:59,312
So, what? Are
you retarded?

1462
01:30:59,387 --> 01:31:01,719
<i>Do you think maybe I
can just sleep over there?</i>

1463
01:31:01,789 --> 01:31:03,984
Yes, fine. You know
where the key is.

1464
01:31:04,058 --> 01:31:05,616
Can I please go
back to sleep?

1465
01:31:05,693 --> 01:31:06,682
<i>Oh, wait, Angie.</i>

1466
01:31:06,761 --> 01:31:09,423
Uh. Do you have any pot?

1467
01:31:09,497 --> 01:31:13,524
Wait. Um. Tell me if this sounds
like a phone hanging up on you?

1468
01:31:13,601 --> 01:31:16,502
Yes.
