00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:05,300
-We haven't eaten. Got anything to eat?
-l'll make you something.

2
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:12,420
-Does Joey help you out?
-He would if he could, l guess.

3
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:16,260
-How do you pay your rent?
-Workfare. Flipping hamburgers.

4
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:20,860
Until they figure out l'm dipping
in the register, which is any day now.

5
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:24,860
-Then l'll be totally fucked.
-When did you see him last?

6
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:28,700
Night before last. Said he was
gonna get some money and go.

7
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,580
-Go where?
-Like he knows?

8
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:36,300
Florida. Key West. Whenever
he gets rabbity, he's going to Florida.

9
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:41,260
Like it's some magic country when it's
only the dope capital of the world.

10
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,980
Can l ask you a question
without you getting mad?

11
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:56,620
Depends.

12
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,460
When you left Joey, was it hard?

13
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,620
Very hard.

14
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,420
You miss him?

15
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,220
Of course.

16
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:12,900
lt get easier, you know, missing him
after a while?

17
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,140
You just stop thinking about it.

18
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:19,460
Put your head down, keep walking.
Otherwise it'd be too difficult.

19
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,220
Was it better for Joey,
you think, that you left?

20
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:28,060
For a while. All l know
is l missed out on stuff.

21
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,940
-Like what?
-Like teaching him about things.

22
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,660
Like good music. Old movies.
Not being afraid to fight. Stuff like that.

23
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:43,620
l guess what you want and what you
can do are different things sometimes.

24
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:46,580
Gina, l wanna help Joey.

25
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,620
You can't help him.
You never did.

26
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,420
That's what he says.

27
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,460
l'm gonna go buy some smokes.
Can l borrow a couple bucks?

28
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:07,580
Yeah, my wallet is in the hall
on that table.

29
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,940
-You need anything?
-No, thanks.

30
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:15,460
-You don't mind watching Angelo for a bit?
-He'll be okay.

31
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,180
You be good.
Mommy's gonna be right back.

32
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:22,940
His Pampers and stuff
are in the duffel.

33
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,900
-Duffy.
-Reg.

34
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,700
My son's girlfriend
brought over my grandson.

35
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:48,740
-Can you hear me?
-Hello? lt's a lousy connection.

36
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:53,700
She's spooked. She just went out.
When she comes back, l'll turn up the heat.

37
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:56,580
-When she comes--
-We're heading to Long Beach.

38
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:59,660
-l got a warrant for the casino.
-Want me to meet you?

39
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,620
There's Mommy.

40
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,020
Thattaboy.

41
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,740
Who's this?

42
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:24,700
This is my grandson, Angelo.
Joey's kid.

43
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:29,500
His mother just dropped him off.
l didn't even know he existed.

44
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,660
Listen, Vincent.

45
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:39,660
l brought your keys back. l think
we need to take it easy for a while.

46
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:43,100
Why don't you come in for a second
and we can talk?

47
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:47,620
We gotta talk. Come on.
We should talk, you know?

48
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:58,660
-l didn't go out to buy smokes.
-What's going on?

49
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:04,380
Look, l've been thinking.
l'm thinking about scoring.

50
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:08,820
-l'm sorry l took your money.
-Forget the money. Let me come get you.

51
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,780
l'm gonna go away for a while, okay?

52
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:15,700
Don't do this, you'll regret it.
A kid needs his mother.

53
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,780
-Don't do this.
-He's better off without me.

54
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:23,300
No, that's not true. Please.
l'll come get you. Where are you?

55
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,460
You did it.

56
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:27,900
Maybe l'm like you.
l can't do it. l just can't hang.

57
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:31,060
Stay here. Or l'll get you
your own apartment. Come back.

58
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:34,900
You're gonna pay for it.
It's a big mistake. Just come back--

59
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,980
-Would you listen to me?
-Please come back.

60
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:41,140
Joey might be crashed up
at that old merry-go-round.

61
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,540
He's gonna be up in the attic.

62
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,460
-You won't hurt him?
-Of course not. But please come back.

63
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:51,300
-Please, you can't leave him.
-Sorry. You know, l tried.

64
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,380
-l'm sorry.
-What can I do to make you--?

65
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,500
-She's not coming back?
-No.

66
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:06,260
She told me where Joey was.

67
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,460
Can you...?

68
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,580
Take care of him? Can't say no.

69
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:17,100
l came here to give you
your key back. And to get mine.

70
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:20,820
l'll come back and take care of him.
Just let me do this.

71
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,620
We'll talk then, all right?

72
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,660
We're right outside.

73
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:43,100
Yeah. Okay, thanks.
We're down here by this casino.

74
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,940
-Send us some backup.
-Come on, let's go.

75
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:49,300
-You're not gonna wait?
-Vince and l were here already.

76
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,740
Let's see if anyone's there,
then get back to town. lt's late.

77
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,260
All right. Easy, easy.

78
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,140
-This place stinks.
-Yeah, the lovely smell of humanity.

79
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:10,900
l'm taking my gloves off.
l got them fucked up last time.

80
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,700
Holy shit, look at all this.

81
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:19,420
-Watch it. There's used needles all over.
-l'll bet.

82
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,540
Shit!

83
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,740
Fuck!

84
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,100
Officer down.

85
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,980
Officer down, Long Beach Casino!
Officer down!

86
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,300
Rossi, what happened?

87
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,740
He was up there with a gun.

88
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,580
Reg is over there.

89
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:30,660
-Oh, no. Jesus.
-l'm sorry, lieutenant.

90
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:34,580
-What happened?
-They called for an assist but didn't wait.

91
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,940
You don't go in for a murder suspect
without backup!

92
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:42,180
He said you and him were already here
before together alone.

93
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,740
Goddamn it, Reg.

94
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:04,340
One question.
Can l have a statement?

95
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:10,380
-Chief Henderson.
-Lieutenant Katt, Long Beach Police.

96
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,660
Crime scene is in here.

97
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,860
Lt. LaMarca!

98
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:25,220
Chief wants to see you.

99
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:32,220
Okay, here's the facts
as we know them so far:

100
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:36,660
A .45-caliber reported stolen
from a clinic this morning.

101
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:39,900
Suspect's name is Joseph LaMarca.
He's at--

102
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,420
-Wait a minute.
-Not now.

103
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:45,180
You don't have enough to make
Joey the prime suspect.

104
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:49,380
-l know it's your kid--
-Evidence. Rossi didn't see it.

105
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,500
-l didn't see it.
-He didn't see anybody.

106
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:54,980
-You said Joey hung out here.
-That was just a lead.

107
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:59,100
-lt doesn't prove anything.
-This is an investigation.

108
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:03,780
l'm just saying you don't have enough
to make him the prime suspect.

109
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:07,620
We got a fingerprint match
on the murder weapon.

110
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:11,940
l'm sorry, lieutenant.
lt's definitely your boy.

111
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,940
l'm here at the crime scene
at the boardwalk...

112
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:21,700
...where a detective was gunned down
during a manhunt for Joseph LaMarca...

113
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:26,140
...a murder suspect police consider
armed and dangerous.

114
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,980
They're tearing the house apart.
They say Joey killed some cop.

115
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:33,900
-Not some cop. My partner.
-l know what they'll do when they find him.

116
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:39,460
l know what cops do to cop killers. One way
or another, they'll find a way to kill him.

117
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:42,540
-lt's too late.
-lt's not his fault.

118
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:45,580
Then whose fault is it?
Did you pull the trigger?

119
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:49,060
-He doesn't know what he's doing.
-Don't start with that.

120
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:53,460
You choose right or wrong.
He's got nobody to blame but himself.

121
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:57,700
-Please help him. You're all he's got.
-Then he's got nothing.

122
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,660
Please, help him!

123
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:03,740
Don't walk away from him again!

124
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:44,580
--himself the son of Angelo LaMarca,
executed for a horrific murder in 1 959.

125
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:49,260
This photo shows LaMarca being booked
for the murder of the baby...

126
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:55,500
...who was strangled to death while
LaMarca attempted to collect the ransom.

127
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,580
Marge.

128
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:07,020
Here. Take these into the living room.

129
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:10,100
Come on now. Come on.

130
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,860
l'm sorry it was your boy.
That'll be hard for you.

131
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,940
l'm sorry. l'm just so sorry.

132
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:27,260
lt's hard to believe Reg will
never be coming home again.

133
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,460
Why did he do it, Vince?

134
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:39,340
Reg never would have hurt your boy.

135
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:42,980
lt's just so wrong. lt's just....
lt's just so wrong.

136
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:46,620
l swear to God, if there's
anything l can do....

137
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:52,660
Daddy, no!

138
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,980
Bree's gonna miss him the most.

139
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:14,140
LaMarca has had a long career
with this department...

140
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:19,060
...living down the tragedy of his father's
past and that of his troubled....

141
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:21,540
-Hi.
-Hi.

142
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:24,140
-Where's Angelo?
-Asleep in your bed.

143
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:28,060
LaMarca has been moved
to a different case.

144
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:30,380
There they go. The big story.

145
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:39,460
l don't know what to say.
l'm sorry, Vincent.

146
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:43,100
l went to see Reg's wife.

147
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:50,500
You know, all the other cops
wouldn't look at me.

148
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:53,860
Just like it was at school.

149
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:57,500
Nobody says anything,
but they think you're guilty too.

150
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:00,780
You can't blame yourself for everything.

151
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,100
ls Joey my fault?

152
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:09,860
l don't know. But you're not responsible
for everything your son does.

153
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,740
He's gotta choose who he wants to be.

154
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:15,140
You think we get a choice?

155
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:20,620
We just pretend that we got a choice.
lt's more like a sentence.

156
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:26,740
When my old man did what he did,
l felt so bad, you know.

157
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,340
l felt like l was the criminal.

158
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:34,900
No way l'd feel that way again. l'd be
so good nobody could pin anything on me.

159
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,540
That was my choice.

160
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:40,740
But now, whether your dad
is a cop or a murderer...

161
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:45,660
...some kid's father's not coming home.
That's the real life sentence.

162
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,820
Yeah.

163
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,780
So, what do we do, Michelle?

164
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,980
Want your keys back?

165
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,820
-LaMarca.
-l didn't shoot that cop.

166
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,780
-Joey?
-You hear me? I didn't shoot him.

167
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:12,220
I didn't shoot him.

168
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:16,140
Somebody did. l just left
the wife and daughter crying.

169
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:20,660
-Well, it wasn't me.
-Let's meet where we watched the planes.

170
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:24,180
-What?
-Remember we used to watch the planes?

171
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,700
-Yeah.
-Remember where that was?

172
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,900
-Yeah.
-l'll be there, just me.

173
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,500
Why should l trust you?

174
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:36,100
Joey, you don't have a choice.
l'll be there by myself, l promise.

175
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:38,860
Please. You gotta do it. Please.

176
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,580
All right.

177
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:46,660
-You gonna meet him?
-l hope so.

178
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,980
-What are you looking at?
-The van down there.

179
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:53,460
-They're tapping the phone.
-But you're on their side.

180
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:57,860
l don't think they see it--
l don't think they see it that way.

181
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:00,260
-Speak.
-Let's not play games.

182
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:04,100
-Sorry, chief.
-Why get cute about the meeting spot?

183
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,980
l know what happens
if the wrong cop goes.

184
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:10,900
You got my word that nothing's
gonna happen to Joey.

185
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:15,900
Your word is good with me. lf l can,
l'll bring him in to you. l gotta go.

186
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:21,460
There will be a lot of cops up here
looking for me. Bring Angelo to your place.

187
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:25,180
-Where are you going?
-You can't say what you don't know.

188
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,220
You still watch those planes.

189
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,660
Yeah.

190
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:18,180
l met Angelo.

191
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:21,220
Gina brought him over.
Nice little kid.

192
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:26,820
Because of Gina, not me.
She won't let me see him.

193
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:30,140
She says l gotta stay away
till l get clean.

194
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:32,860
Which will be whenever.

195
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:41,100
-l got this lawyer ready to meet with us.
-You wanna take me in?

196
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,020
l wanna help.

197
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,980
Did you hear me? l didn't do the cop.

198
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:49,260
l come to talk to you,
you bring up a lawyer.

199
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:54,820
You think maybe your lawyer could
get me the electric chair? Fuck.

200
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,340
Too weird, huh?

201
00:19:56,540 --> 00:20:00,260
lf l got the chair too,
just like your old man?

202
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:02,860
You ever think about him?

203
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,300
Sure.

204
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:11,580
-Did you love him?
-He was my father. Of course l did.

205
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:17,260
Because someone's your father means
you gotta love him? You think l love you?

206
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:21,580
-l don't know.
-Right. You don't even know me, do you?

207
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,340
No, l guess l don't.

208
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,660
You wanna tell me?

209
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:39,300
-You know l was quarterback in high school?
-No. Your mother never told me anything.

210
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:45,820
-l used to look for you in the stands.
-l would've loved to see you play.

211
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:48,300
You should have. l was good.

212
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:53,220
We beat Cedarhurst
in the county finals.

213
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,780
First time in 24 years.

214
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,020
The crowd went wild.

215
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,940
l didn't need drugs that night.

216
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,140
l was good then.

217
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,540
You should have seen me.

218
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,540
l wish l had.

219
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:17,940
All right, fuck it.
We all got reasons.

220
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:20,740
So you believe me about the cop,
or what?

221
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:25,620
-Your prints are on the gun.
-l wasn't there when the cop went down.

222
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:29,260
That cop had a name.
His name was Reg.

223
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,220
So who was there?

224
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:39,260
Fucking scumbag dealer named Spyder.

225
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:42,420
He's after me for his fucking $4000.

226
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:45,380
lf l had it,
l'd be on a plane to Florida.

227
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:47,100
Did you see him?

228
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:50,660
No, l didn't see him do it
but l saw him right after.

229
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:55,260
-l mean right after. ln the alley there.
-What about Picasso?

230
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:58,540
l don't know.

231
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,780
Look, l was fucked up...

232
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,380
...he came at me with a knife....

233
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:10,500
-l guess, in a sense, l killed him.
-ln a sense?

234
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:16,460
l don't know what happened. One minute
we're fighting and the next he's dead.

235
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,540
But that wasn't me.

236
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:23,060
All right? That wasn't the real me.

237
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:26,900
l wouldn't count
on a jury believing that.

238
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:31,980
This is something you can't run away from.
You can't. You can't run.

239
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:36,900
-Do you believe me?
-lt doesn't matter what l believe.

240
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:41,380
Plead self-defense, you could get off
with maybe six years.

241
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:46,940
What if it matters to me
what you believe?

242
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:50,100
l gotta take you in, you know that.

243
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,820
What are you, a cop or my father?

244
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,820
l'm both.

245
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:08,900
-l'm getting out of here. What are you now?
-Joey, come on!

246
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:13,020
Just fucking with you.
l knew the answer.

247
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:19,940
You know, when l was a kid,
l wanted to be a cop.

248
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,420
l really did.

249
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,660
Just like you.

250
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,660
Chief.

251
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,660
Where's your boy?

252
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:54,740
Picasso worked for a dealer called Spyder.
Spyder's after Joey for his $4000.

253
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:59,660
Joey told me he saw Spyder in the alley
by the casino after Reg was hit.

254
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:04,140
-Why didn't you bring your boy in?
-He told me he didn't kill Reg.

255
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:06,060
-You believed him?
-l believed him.

256
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:09,540
He's your son, of course
you wanna believe him.

257
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,780
-l've been a cop 25 years--
-The operative word is ''cop.''

258
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:16,540
You're not sometimes a cop,
sometimes a junkie's father.

259
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:20,540
You're either a cop
or you're not a cop. End of story.

260
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,780
This is bullshit.

261
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:28,420
You're under oath to perform
your duty. ln this investigation--

262
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:31,660
What investigation?
You already made your mind up.

263
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:38,980
Peace, all right?

264
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,540
Don't be playing no bullshit neither.

265
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,940
A motherfucking ghost.

266
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:52,700
-How come you still breathing, Casper?
-Listen.

267
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:55,260
A thousand dollars for my Nova.

268
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:59,100
Cops got your wheels, boy.

269
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:03,140
l'm sorry, man.
Will you do me a solid here, please?

270
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:04,380
l need help.

271
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,580
Please.

272
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:11,180
What's the ring?

273
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:15,500
-lt's a football ring. lt ain't for sale.
-Let me see.

274
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:23,180
This is worth like 1 00, easy.
But l'm saving it for my son.

275
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:28,260
We'll treat it like a loan
until l get you the 1 00 back.

276
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:29,700
Yeah, sure.

277
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,540
All right.

278
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,340
Here.

279
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:37,860
No, Carl, l can't use this.
l need cash.

280
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:42,380
-You'd be the first junkie who couldn't.
-Give me the ring.

281
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:46,020
Back the fuck off!
You lucky l'm giving you anything!

282
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:49,060
Please, the ring's important.
lt's for my boy.

283
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:53,860
You ain't gonna be around to see your boy.
And you ain't going to Florida.

284
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:57,500
You got Spyder and the cops
chasing you. You a junkie!

285
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:01,820
Only place you're going is the morgue.
County, motherfucker!

286
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:16,900
Wait a minute! What are you doing?
There's nothing in there for you.

287
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:19,660
Want to come over and see my soup?

288
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,980
Look, here's grandpa.

289
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:27,740
This is Evelyn Hancock.
She's an old friend.

290
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:30,780
You're a big boy, Angelo.

291
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:33,100
Evelyn is with Child Services.

292
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:34,620
What's going on?

293
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:38,580
She's taking Angelo until
Gina comes back. lt's temporary.

294
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:41,140
She's not coming back.

295
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:43,740
l can't take care of him.

296
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,820
-Can l talk to you?
-Sure.

297
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,740
Go see this nice lady.

298
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:51,780
l just wanna talk to him
for a minute.

299
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:58,140
-What are you doing?
-What am l supposed to do?

300
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:02,740
-Take care of him. You're his grandfather.
-Nice idea, but l can't.

301
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:07,060
Vincent, Gina's gone.
You think his father is coming back?

302
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:12,020
-This is the best thing for him.
-No, you're the best thing for him.

303
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:15,580
-l can help you.
-You never had kids, you don't know.

304
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:19,780
-You're gonna walk away from him.
-What do you mean, walking away?

305
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:22,020
-Like with Joey.
-l'm not walking away!

306
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:27,180
-That's what you told me you did with Joey.
-l'm not-- Walk away?

307
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,020
Let me show you something.

308
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:35,340
Let me show you something.

309
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:41,780
You think l want him growing up with
this? Like the son of Frankenstein?

310
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:46,660
''You never know what he might do.''
''Don't mention his father!''

311
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:51,180
Call it walking away, but l'm doing
the best thing for him.

312
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:54,220
That is not about Angelo.
That's about you.

313
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:59,020
You told me. You told me
you never had a choice, right?

314
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:03,420
-Well, you got one right here.
-Michelle, try to understand.

315
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:07,100
Right now it's more than l can handle.
l can't do it.

316
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,860
That's how you make a choice.

317
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:20,980
Goodbye.

318
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:44,340
Morning.

319
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:50,460
Let's try to wrap this up.
We got pretty substantial evidence.

320
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:54,500
Fingerprints are clear.
There are no others on the gun.

321
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:57,860
Shells and ballistics
identify it as the shooter's.

322
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:01,780
We know he frequented the carousel
and used drugs there.

323
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:04,380
-Excuse me, sir.
-Go ahead, Dave.

324
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:08,300
A shoe print in the blood
doesn't match LaMarca's size.

325
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:11,260
So, what do we think?
That O.J. was there?

326
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:13,580
Maybe Bruno Magli?

327
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:16,460
One last thing.
This kid has killed twice.

328
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:20,380
Don't give him a chance
to do it again. We got that?

329
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:36,420
You got a phone call on my phone.
How come you're giving out my number?

330
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:40,420
-l don't even know your number.
-This guy knows it.

331
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:45,620
Make sure you leave a nickel
in the ashtray.

332
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:54,420
Dave Simon.
l couldn't call you direct.

333
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,620
What's going on?

334
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:59,420
l have something you should see.

335
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:03,140
Could we meet at York
and 59th Street Bridge?

336
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:06,620
It's copies of crime scene photos
I tried to mention.

337
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:07,860
What are they?

338
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:11,300
Footprints in the blood
at the top of the ladder.

339
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:13,500
We can account for all of them...

340
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:18,620
...except for one heel from a size 1 0
cowboy boot made by Justin Boots.

341
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:22,060
At your ex-wife's
we found some of Joey's stuff.

342
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,340
Joey wears a size 1 2 1 /2 shoe.

343
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:27,620
There's no 1 2 1 /2 prints
anywhere in this blood.

344
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,660
l appreciate this.

345
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:35,180
Well, you know,
it doesn't all have to be bullshit.

346
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:40,100
-You born in Long Beach?
-No, Army brat. We lived all over.

347
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:43,620
-Distant climes, huh?
-We traveled a lot.

348
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:48,140
-Now we got a baby. l hardly get out.
-Kids change everything.

349
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,780
lsn't that the truth.

350
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:55,620
Sir, listen,
l'm real sorry about your son.

351
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:01,860
l appreciate it. Thank you very much.
l appreciate that.

352
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,860
It's more than I can handle.

353
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:46,460
-We just pretend we got a choice.
-We don't have a son, I do.

354
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,860
I wasn't gonna feel that again.

355
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:53,060
-You think I love you?
-I should've tried harder.

356
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,660
You said you never had a choice.

357
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:58,260
-What are you, a cop or my father?
-That's my son.

358
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:01,780
Please help him. You're all he's got.
He's your son!

359
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:06,100
-This is something you can't run away from.
-Just like his dad.

360
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:19,140
Sorry, sir. We're closed.

361
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:25,780
-Anybody know where Spyder is?
-We're closed, mister.

362
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:29,620
Where's Spyder?

363
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:32,380
Peace, brother. Peace.

364
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:39,020
Stick the Friar Tuck act up your ass.
Where's Spyder?

365
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:41,300
-You know who l am?
-Yeah--

366
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:45,140
Tell Spyder l know he killed
my partner. l got proof.

367
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:49,860
He wants to see me, l'm at the Seaway
Motel. Room 1 05. You got that?

368
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:51,100
Yeah.

369
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:55,100
1 05. Seaway Motel.

370
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:39,900
Here's where we're
expecting the storm.

371
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:44,700
On our map, lots of green.
And within that, yellows and reds.

372
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:48,140
These are the areas
where we're expecting heavy rain.

373
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:54,100
In New York City, the storm
will move in by tomorrow morning.

374
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,900
You got something for me?

375
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:38,340
Dave Simon.

376
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:40,460
Lt. LaMarca.

377
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:45,340
Got it.

378
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:49,940
l want backup and emergency units
to Ocean and Neptune. Lt. Katt?

379
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:08,220
Don't fucking move!

380
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,940
Don't move a finger.

381
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:13,860
Give me the gun.
Give me the fucking gun! Go ahead.

382
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:20,660
Move!

383
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:27,180
What the fuck is this?

384
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:31,020
What are you doing
telling people l shot that cop?

385
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:33,700
l know you killed my partner,
scumbag.

386
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:37,660
lt was your junkie kid.
l'm not the only one that thinks so.

387
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:41,780
You left a footprint in his blood.
Are those Justin, size 1 0?

388
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:49,940
-You're a long way from Manhattan.
-But too close to home for you.

389
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:54,820
You broke into my property.
l'm within my rights to defend it.

390
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:17,740
l couldn't take the chance
he'd hurt Gina or Angelo.

391
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:19,660
Would be just like him.

392
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:28,860
You broke in here pretty good.

393
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:31,460
You learn that in cop school?

394
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,420
So, what now, Joey?

395
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:50,900
Hold back and hold your fire!
Hold your fire!

396
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:53,900
Keep eyes on that door
and those windows!

397
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:57,060
Block that road!
l don't want one TV van!

398
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:58,580
Right up there.

399
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:07,980
Okay, enough. Give me the gun.

400
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:12,700
lt'll be hard enough getting you
out alive without them seeing that.

401
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:17,660
This is no game, son. Please.

402
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:22,180
You saved my life but they
didn't see it. They don't care.

403
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:27,540
-l ain't going to jail.
-l understand. l wanna help you, just....

404
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:29,460
Just give me the gun.

405
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:36,300
Lt. LaMarca, signal your location!

406
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:37,620
All right, talk.

407
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,540
Talk?

408
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:42,140
What are you now, fucking Oprah?

409
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:47,420
You got a son and a woman that
loves you. Don't run away from that.

410
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:50,180
-You did.
-Yeah.

411
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:52,380
l did.

412
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:55,940
And l'm sorry.
l've regretted it ever since.

413
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:59,780
We all gotta pay
one way or another, right?

414
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,860
What's going on?

415
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:05,620
lt's called ''suicide by cop.''

416
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:09,940
Quick and easy.
No pills. No fucking around.

417
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:12,060
l thought l'd try it.

418
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:19,820
How did we get this way?
l remember the day you were born.

419
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:23,580
Well, l remember the day you left.
So we're even.

420
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:30,100
-l'm not gonna kill you, son.
-Well....

421
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:32,300
Your friends out there will.

422
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:34,580
You know it.

423
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:42,260
-There he is!
-You two!

424
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:03,860
Hold back! Hold your fire!

425
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:06,620
Get the building secure.

426
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:08,260
Give me the gun.

427
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:12,660
-l don't want to shoot you.
-You do. You think l deserve it.

428
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:16,020
-Get back!
-But you won't. lt's not the real you.

429
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:19,780
-You don't know anything about me.
-l do. You're my kid.

430
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:23,500
You're not a bad kid. You're a scared kid
whose old man left him.

431
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:29,260
You didn't get a choice and it hurt. l know.
But you're my son. You always will be.

432
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:30,980
Then why did you leave?

433
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:34,620
l was stupid. l forgot
what it felt like to be alone.

434
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:39,620
You don't want to do to Angelo what
l did to you. What my old man did to me.

435
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:42,220
-You can't.
-He don't need a junkie.

436
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:46,420
You're not a junkie to him.
My old man wasn't a killer to me.

437
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:51,140
When my old man left, l hated him
all my life for what he did to me.

438
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:56,020
But all l wanted was for him to walk
in the door because l missed him.

439
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:58,620
l didn't want to be alone
anymore.

440
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:02,540
We all pay a price for what we do,
but when's enough?

441
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:06,740
Because l paid. And you paid. And what?
Now Angelo has to pay?

442
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:11,260
You can't! We got a second chance
here, me and you.

443
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:14,220
l let you think
you didn't matter to me.

444
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:16,740
But l swear l won't run away again.

445
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:20,940
l'll stay with you, l promise.
You just need to choose it.

446
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:24,220
Know how many people
would love a second chance?

447
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:33,340
Help me.

448
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:51,820
-Dad, are you okay?
-lt's just my shoulder.

449
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:55,780
-l didn't do it.
-l know.

450
00:43:57,220 --> 00:43:58,620
