00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,300
You don't speak Spanish,
right?

2
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Are you ready?

3
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,200
Everything is cool?

4
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,500
Yes.

5
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Good.

6
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,500
Use your imagination
and your skills.

7
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,500
Everything is subjective.
Whatever that means.

8
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,200
He who think he's bigger than
the rest, must go to the cemetery.

9
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:17,200
There he will see what life
really is. It's a handful of dust.

10
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,500
<i>La vida no vale nada.</i>

11
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,600
<i>Diamonds are
a girl's best friend.</i>

12
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,300
<i>Go to the towers.
Go to the café.</i>

13
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,500
Wait a couple of days...

14
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,700
...and watch for the violin.

15
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,700
Two espressos
in separate cups.

16
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:56,700
No. Two espressos
in separate cups.

17
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,000
No.
I said two espressos.

18
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:26,600
<i>Dos espressos, dos
espressos. In separate cups.</i>

19
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,200
<i>Señor.</i>

20
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,800
<i>Dos espressos,
in separate cups.</i>

21
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,800
Two espressos,
in separate cups.

22
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:04,900
<i>Si.</i>

23
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,800
<i>Sus dos espressos...</i>

24
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,500
No.

25
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,600
<i>Very loud.</i>

26
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,900
Are you interested in
music, by any chance?

27
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,300
What else?

28
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,900
Wait with the girl.
She's a criss-cross.

29
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,600
No.

30
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:10,900
Yeah...

31
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,200
...you left your bag
unprotected.

32
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,500
There's nothing in it.

33
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,200
Oh.

34
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,100
<i>Ah.</i>

35
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,400
<i>Do you like my ass?</i>

36
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Yes.

37
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:54,900
So, what's wrong?

38
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,300
You don't like sex?

39
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,900
Never, while I'm working.

40
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,400
Really?

41
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,000
How can you stand it?

42
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,600
<i>Hola.</i>

43
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,100
<i>Do you like my raincoat?</i>

44
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,500
Yes.

45
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,100
So, you don't like
mobiles, either.

46
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,400
Huh.

47
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,600
No guns...

48
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:29,200
...no mobiles...

49
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,100
...no sex...

50
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
No.

51
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,600
<i>Suspicion.</i>

52
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:37,800
Hitchcock.

53
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:43,600
Are you interested in films,
by any chance?

54
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,400
I like really old films.

55
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,900
You can really see what
the world looked like...

56
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,400
...thirty, fifty,
a hundred years ago.

57
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:04,100
You know the clothes,
the telephones, the trains...

58
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,200
...the way people
smoked cigarettes...

59
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,200
...the little details
of life.

60
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,300
The best films
are like dreams

61
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:21,100
you're never sure
you've really had.

62
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,000
I have this image in my head
of a room full of sand.

63
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,300
And a bird flies towards me,
and dips its wing into the sand.

64
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,200
And I honestly
have no idea...

65
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,600
...whether this image came
from a dream, or a film.

66
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:50,600
Sometimes I like it in films
when people just sit there,

67
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,100
not saying anything.

68
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,400
Oh, yes.

69
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,300
<i>Diamonds are
a girl's best friend.</i>

70
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,700
<i>Have you seen
"The Lady from Shanghai,"</i>

71
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,000
Orson Welles?

72
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,800
That one makes no sense.

73
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,400
Rita Hayworth as a blonde.

74
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:54,000
I think it's the only film
she's ever a blonde in.

75
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,400
<i>It's like a game.
Deception, glamour...</i>

76
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,400
...a shootout with
shattered mirrors.

77
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,900
She dies in the end.

78
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,500
So, I finally have
what you need.

79
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,200
<i>Do you have what I need?</i>

80
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:03,100
<i>Do you like Schubert,
by any chance?</i>

81
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,200
I love him.

82
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:19,000
He died when he was
thirty one years old.

83
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,500
Something like that.

84
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:26,400
No.

85
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:37,200
Are you interested in
science by any chance?

86
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,800
I'm interested
in molecules.

87
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:52,200
The Sufis say each one of us
is a planet spinning in ecstasy.

88
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:55,700
<i>But I say...</i>

89
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:01,700
...each one of us is a
set of shifting molecules.

90
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,800
Spinning in ecstasy.

91
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:18,200
In the near future...

92
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:22,500
...worn out things will be made new
again by reconfiguring their molecules.

93
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:27,200
A pair of shoes.
A tire.

94
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:30,100
<i>Molecular detection
will also allow...</i>

95
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:33,700
...the determination of an
object's physical history.

96
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:38,000
This match box
for example.

97
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:45,600
Its collection of molecules could
indicate everywhere it's ever been.

98
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:49,400
They could do it
with your clothes.

99
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:54,900
Or even with your skin,
for that matter.

100
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Wait three days until
you see the bread.

101
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,200
The guitar will find you.

102
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:52,500
Among us, there are those
who are not among us.

103
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:55,600
I'm among no one.

104
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:33,300
No.

105
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:27,800
Take a seat.

106
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:09,400
No. I don't speak
Spanish, either.

107
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,700
Except, maybe
when I'm in Spain.

108
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,400
Would one still call
those, "bohemians?"

109
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:26,000
<i>My grandfather
was Bohemian.</i>

110
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:29,300
You know,
in the Prague sense.

111
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:34,500
I strongly doubt that he would
have had any bloody sympathy...

112
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:36,500
...for those kinds
of bohemians.

113
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:42,500
And then of course, they are often
the true artists, are they not?

114
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,200
Are you interested
in art, by any chance?

115
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:49,300
<i>Maybe painting,
perhaps?</i>

116
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:51,700
Yes.

117
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:59,800
Well, as we were discussing, the
derivation of the usage of bohemian...

118
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:03,800
...in reference to artists or
artistic types, wasn't that it?

119
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:11,600
I don't know
the origin, exactly.

120
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:15,300
<i>Of course there's Puccini's
opera, "La Bohème".</i>

121
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:18,300
<i>That's based on the French book,
"Scènes de la vie de bohème".</i>

122
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:20,500
Probably published
mid-nineteenth century.

123
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:28,100
There was an oddly
beautiful Finnish film...

124
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:32,500
...some years ago
based on the book.

125
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:36,600
<i>But where the use of
bohemian or bohème in French,</i>

126
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:38,100
came from to
begin with...

127
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:41,500
I can only speculate.

128
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:01,600
Oh...

129
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:10,200
Yes, of course. I imagine
you have... things to do.

130
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,600
<i>The Mexican will find you,
he has the driver.</i>

131
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:19,400
Ah yes...

132
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:21,300
...the driver.

133
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:34,800
You do know...

134
01:08:37,900 --> 01:08:43,300
<i>...that this guitar was owned
and played by Manuel el Sevillano.</i>

135
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:50,600
It was recorded on a wax cylinder
in the 1920's, believe it or not.

136
01:08:54,300 --> 01:08:56,600
God only knows
whatever happened to that.

137
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:09,200
<i>Been nice talking with you.</i>

138
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:18,800
<i>As they say,
la vida no vale nada.</i>

139
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:57,800
<i>Los Americanos!</i>

140
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:50,300
I heard you have a very
beautiful black girlfriend.

141
01:20:52,700 --> 01:20:53,900
She's asleep.

142
01:21:34,100 --> 01:21:35,500
Nothing is true.

143
01:21:39,700 --> 01:21:41,000
Every thing's imagined.

144
01:21:47,900 --> 01:21:49,400
<i>Do you
notice reflections?</i>

145
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:56,000
For me, sometimes the
reflection is far more present...

146
01:21:56,100 --> 01:21:57,800
...than the thing
being reflected.

147
01:22:11,900 --> 01:22:14,500
Are you interested in
hallucinations, by any chance?

148
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:19,100
Have you ever
tried peyote?

149
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:40,400
They wear mirrors
around their necks.

150
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:45,200
And they play violins.
Handmade violins.

151
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:48,600
With only one string.

152
01:23:13,900 --> 01:23:15,400
I'm going to
call the driver.

153
01:23:20,300 --> 01:23:21,600
<i>No mobiles.</i>

154
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:29,800
<i>Està bien.</i>

155
01:23:31,300 --> 01:23:32,300
<i>Ya, ya, ya...</i>

156
01:25:09,300 --> 01:25:10,400
No mobiles.

157
01:41:16,400 --> 01:41:18,500
These fucking
Spanish assholes.

158
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,300
<i>Jesus Christ! Addington!</i>

159
01:41:25,200 --> 01:41:26,700
Fucking sound proof door.

160
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:32,900
How the fuck did
you get in here?

161
01:41:34,600 --> 01:41:36,700
I used my imagination.

162
01:41:55,700 --> 01:41:59,600
Is this your twisted idea
of revenge for something?

163
01:42:01,600 --> 01:42:04,400
No. Revenge is useless.

164
01:42:07,400 --> 01:42:10,900
<i>Addington! Security!
God damn it!</i>

165
01:42:22,600 --> 01:42:24,500
What is your
fucking agenda here?

166
01:42:28,900 --> 01:42:31,600
You people
don't understand...

167
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,900
...a fucking thing about
how the world really works.

168
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:37,100
I understand.

169
01:42:40,400 --> 01:42:43,000
<i>But I understand
subjectively.</i>

170
01:42:45,300 --> 01:42:46,900
That's fucking nonsense.

171
01:42:50,300 --> 01:42:54,700
Your sick minds have
been polluted with crap.

172
01:42:56,300 --> 01:43:00,900
Your music,
movies, science.

173
01:43:02,100 --> 01:43:05,000
Fucking bohemians
on hallucinogenic drugs.

174
01:43:05,100 --> 01:43:08,000
All that shit has
poisoned you.

175
01:43:10,300 --> 01:43:12,800
And it has nothing to
do with the real world.

176
01:43:15,900 --> 01:43:19,800
And I suppose you believe
that by eliminating me...

177
01:43:19,800 --> 01:43:26,000
...you will eliminate control over
some fucking artificial reality.

178
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:28,700
Reality is arbitrary.

179
01:43:34,700 --> 01:43:36,300
Fuck you.
