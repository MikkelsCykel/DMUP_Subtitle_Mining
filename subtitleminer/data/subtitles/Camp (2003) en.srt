00:00:42,084 --> 00:00:44,670
Father

2
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:49,299
Sister

3
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:04,398
Father, sister

4
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:07,568
Dearest voices

5
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:09,987
I have found you

6
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,073
And I don't know how

7
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:16,368
Father, sister

8
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:19,496
I hear your voices

9
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,999
But am I dreamin'?

10
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,668
Are you here right now?

11
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:26,461
Can you tell me?

12
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:30,465
How shall I see you
through my tears?

13
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:32,176
Please tell me

14
00:01:32,176 --> 00:01:35,262
How shall I see you
through my tears?

15
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:38,182
I need to know

16
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:44,271
How shall I see you
through my tears?

17
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:46,273
Father, sister

18
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:49,067
The gods have spoken

19
00:01:49,193 --> 00:01:51,987
I bring a promise

20
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:54,865
A holy vow

21
00:01:56,491 --> 00:02:01,163
A world that casts you out,
forgives you

22
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:04,166
And those who blame you

23
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:07,169
Sing your praises now

24
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:08,587
So can you tell me?

25
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:12,966
How shall I see you
through my tears?

26
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:14,760
Please tell me

27
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:17,971
How shall I see you
through my tears?

28
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:20,390
I need to know

29
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:23,393
How shall I see you
through my tears?

30
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:26,396
Yeah, yeah, yeah

31
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,066
To all the critics out there,
I know they're going to review this,

32
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:31,193
and I know they're
gonna try to knock me...

33
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:33,695
is it okay if I say this
to camera, Amber?

34
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:36,281
I only am who I am
'cause I was born that way.

35
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:41,495
I have a gift, and I'm trying not
to be selfish about it, but to use it.

36
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:44,581
If you're gonna knock me for that,
that's your problem.

37
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:48,168
Jealousy will get you nowhere.
And I'm gonna keep rockin' on.

38
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:54,591
Destiny
brings you back to me

39
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:58,679
Child, I'm so glad I'm here

40
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:02,391
There's hope for me,
there's a prophecy

41
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:06,979
Destiny
brings you back to me

42
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:10,566
A world that casts you out

43
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:14,194
May forgive you now

44
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:19,074
Destiny
brings you back to me

45
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,578
I've been waiting for a sign

46
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:26,498
To ease my troubled mind

47
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,170
Ellen, what's the matter with you?

48
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:33,964
Don't tell Mom I'm taking you
to your stupid junior prom.

49
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:35,591
Get out of here!

50
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:37,801
Your brother!
How gross is that?

51
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:39,469
They don't know
you're my brother.

52
00:03:39,595 --> 00:03:42,181
Please, Ben.
You have to. I'll pay you.

53
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:45,392
Find someone
who's not related to you.

54
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:46,768
Loser.

55
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:51,583
How shall I see you
through my tears?

56
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,293
Please tell me

57
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:56,880
How shall I see you
through my tears?

58
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:59,466
I need to know

59
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:02,761
How shall I see you
through my tears?

60
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:04,888
Yeah, yeah, yeah

61
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:08,183
How shall I see you
through my tears?

62
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:11,395
When I'm crying tears of sadness

63
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:14,189
How shall I see you
through my tears?

64
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:17,192
Won't you turn them
into tears of gladness?

65
00:05:17,276 --> 00:05:20,863
How shall I see you
through my tears?

66
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:25,868
Yeah, yeah, yeah

67
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:27,578
Tears

68
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:53,103
What are you doing here?
Aren't you, like, 30?

69
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:55,397
Come on!

70
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:01,778
Excuse me, is there someplace
we're supposed to check in?

71
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,197
Over there.

72
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,491
- Is this your first summer?
- I was here last year.

73
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:09,369
Remember? We were in
Night. Mother together.

74
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:14,082
You're Jill Simmons.
My name's Fritzi.

75
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:15,876
Fritzi. Of course.

76
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:19,796
Let me.

77
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:33,685
You have the number
at the ship.

78
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:35,562
Call me whenever you need me.

79
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:37,564
This is Glen,
the camp director.

80
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:39,691
- I know.
- Go to him if you have a problem.

81
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:41,401
That's enough, Mom.
You're embarrassing me.

82
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:43,070
We'll take very good care of him.

83
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:45,864
- Give me a hug.
- I can't breathe!

84
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:49,576
Jenna!

85
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:51,787
My role model
in everything Nubian.

86
00:06:51,787 --> 00:06:53,288
What are you doing here?

87
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:56,583
I thought you had to go to
Weight Watchers Camp this summer.

88
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:57,793
We wanted her to,

89
00:06:57,876 --> 00:07:01,296
but she insisted on
going back to Camp Ovation.

90
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:03,799
So we compromised
and had her jaw wired shut.

91
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:08,303
You can hardly tell.

92
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:14,977
I dim the lights
and think about you

93
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:20,190
Spend sleepless nights
and think about you

94
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:22,776
You said you loved me

95
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:25,779
Buddy Miller,
sports counselor.

96
00:07:25,863 --> 00:07:29,700
- We have a sports counselor?
- Of course we do.

97
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:31,869
You gonna play some softball
this summer?

98
00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:33,078
No.

99
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,597
Michael!

100
00:07:53,182 --> 00:07:56,685
- How you doin', babe?
- Why weren't you on the bus?

101
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:59,104
My sister drove me here.
I'm staying with her.

102
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:01,273
My God, your face.

103
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:04,067
He tried to go to his junior prom
in fishnets and heels.

104
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:05,986
My junior prom,

105
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:08,780
I stayed home with
a roll of cookie dough and TV Land.

106
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,782
I watched my junior prom

107
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:13,785
from outside in the bushes
for three hours.

108
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:15,579
That's so Stella Dallas.

109
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:18,081
Is Bert Hanley
really directing here this summer?

110
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:20,501
I thought he retired.

111
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:23,003
- I thought he died.
- He might have.

112
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,963
He was supposed to
be here two days ago.

113
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:27,382
How does that happen?
He used to be huge.

114
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:29,676
He hasn't had a hit
since Childrehs Crusade.

115
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,094
He never wrote another show.

116
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:33,597
I hope he directs the benefit
this summer.

117
00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:36,266
What are you singing
for auditions for the first show?

118
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:39,102
- Doht Raih oh My Parade.
- That's original.

119
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,981
With the tugboat.

120
00:08:46,485 --> 00:08:48,278
What is that supposed to be?

121
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,288
How you doing?

122
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,875
My name's Vlad.

123
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,885
Okay if I use those drawers?

124
00:09:11,969 --> 00:09:14,096
You can go into
anybody's drawers you like.

125
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:17,099
I don't think
you'll get an argument.

126
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:21,603
Just ignore him.
That's what he's used to.

127
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:24,398
I'm Ellen, this is Shaun

128
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:27,776
and Spitzer and Michael.

129
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:40,289
Bathroom?

130
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:49,673
Thirty-foot rule.

131
00:09:49,673 --> 00:09:50,966
- No way!
- What's that?

132
00:09:50,966 --> 00:09:54,595
Michael has to stay 30 feet away
until we know if he's straight or gay.

133
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:56,471
If he's gay, I'm Tyne Daly.

134
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:33,675
Could someone please shut her up?

135
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:45,896
Next.

136
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:24,685
Childhood living

137
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:30,482
Is easy to do

138
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:38,073
The things you wanted

139
00:11:40,576 --> 00:11:44,204
I bought them for you

140
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:50,878
Graceless lady

141
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:56,884
You know who I am

142
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:04,099
You know I can't let you

143
00:12:06,894 --> 00:12:09,897
Slide through my hands

144
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:16,904
Wild horses

145
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:23,702
Couldn't drag me away

146
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:30,375
Wild, wild horses

147
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:35,506
Couldn't drag me away

148
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:50,771
A boy.
An honest-to-God straight boy.

149
00:12:56,068 --> 00:12:57,277
Cast lists are up.

150
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,907
I will go insane if I don't get
into Promises. Promises.

151
00:13:04,076 --> 00:13:05,285
I'm in it!

152
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:11,166
Midhight Suh?

153
00:13:21,677 --> 00:13:26,682
Old.

154
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:37,192
Old.

155
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:44,074
Lost.

156
00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:49,705
Lost.

157
00:13:50,873 --> 00:13:55,294
Two thousand sunsets,
yet not one sunrise.

158
00:13:55,377 --> 00:13:58,881
No, no, no, no!
God damn you all!

159
00:13:59,006 --> 00:14:01,967
You piss on the memory
of the greatest playwright

160
00:14:02,092 --> 00:14:04,094
of the 20th century.

161
00:14:04,178 --> 00:14:07,389
In Cuba we took our lives
in our hands performing her work,

162
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:10,767
waiting for Castro's thugs
to burst in and arrest us!

163
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,603
I don't understand
what I'm saying.

164
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:15,480
Of course you don't,
you middle-class piece of shit!

165
00:14:15,606 --> 00:14:18,775
- I'm doing the best I can.
- That's what's so tragic.

166
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:20,485
Leave her alone.

167
00:14:25,908 --> 00:14:27,367
How about you, then?

168
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,995
Have you had even
one painful moment in your life

169
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:33,207
since the doctor slapped you
on your ass when you were born?

170
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:37,669
- Yeah.
- Tell me, then.

171
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:39,671
Tell me
your most painful moment,

172
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:42,799
the one that makes you convulse
with sobs when you think of it.

173
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:45,385
Why would I do that
in front of three strangers?

174
00:14:45,469 --> 00:14:48,472
To be able to do it
in front of 3,000.

175
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:53,268
Back to the top, and try not to
screw up the blocking this time.

176
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:56,605
Eyes, eyes, nostrils,
silent scream.

177
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:03,070
I have to go to the bathroom.

178
00:15:03,195 --> 00:15:05,405
Piss in the Dumpster.
Start again!

179
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,482
How was your first day
of rehearsal?

180
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:43,277
It was okay.

181
00:15:46,196 --> 00:15:48,490
I'm a little out of my element.

182
00:15:52,286 --> 00:15:54,788
We really do a new show
every two weeks?

183
00:15:54,872 --> 00:15:57,374
And a benefit
at the end of the summer.

184
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,877
Jeez!

185
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:05,674
Ellen said you were her hero today
with that crazy director.

186
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:09,678
Can I ask you
something personal?

187
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,973
What made you come here?

188
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:16,476
I want to act. Why?

189
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:20,689
We just don't get many like you.

190
00:16:23,901 --> 00:16:25,694
Can I ask you something personal?

191
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:26,904
Yeah.

192
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:29,198
You're gay, right?

193
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:32,492
How do you know?

194
00:16:34,578 --> 00:16:37,581
Have you ever experimented
with heterosexuality?

195
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:42,377
You mean sleep with a straight guy?
What for?

196
00:16:43,587 --> 00:16:47,799
- A girl.
- I can't even straighten my hair.

197
00:16:47,883 --> 00:16:51,803
That's too bad.
You'd be a total playa.

198
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:56,391
Got that whole Latin thing going.

199
00:16:57,601 --> 00:17:01,897
Get a girl alone,
throw on some salsa,

200
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:05,108
whisper a little Spanish in her ear.

201
00:17:06,068 --> 00:17:10,489
- You'd make out like a bandit.
- I'll keep that in mind.

202
00:17:15,994 --> 00:17:17,371
Is that your father?

203
00:17:18,997 --> 00:17:20,874
That's Stephen Sondheim.

204
00:17:24,503 --> 00:17:27,005
The greatest songwriter
in musical theater.

205
00:17:31,385 --> 00:17:33,303
I don't talk to my parents.

206
00:17:33,387 --> 00:17:36,473
- Why not?
- Enough.

207
00:17:36,598 --> 00:17:38,392
I have to keep
some kind of mystery.

208
00:17:38,475 --> 00:17:41,895
You'll grow bored with me
and move on to someone younger.

209
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:46,108
- Good night, Mike.
- 'Night, Vlad.

210
00:17:52,406 --> 00:17:54,908
Did he call me Mike?

211
00:18:28,692 --> 00:18:29,902
Can I help you?

212
00:18:31,403 --> 00:18:33,906
I'm not sure
where I'm supposed to go.

213
00:18:33,906 --> 00:18:37,409
- I'm Bert Hanley.
- It's about time.

214
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:38,785
Where have you been?

215
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:41,205
You were supposed to
be here two days ago.

216
00:18:42,497 --> 00:18:45,792
You're right.
What's the use in lying?

217
00:18:45,876 --> 00:18:50,172
- I've been drinking for 72 hours.
- You've been drinking?

218
00:18:50,297 --> 00:18:53,509
Not the way you make it sound
when you say, "Drinking?!"

219
00:18:54,593 --> 00:18:56,470
I'm fine now, really.

220
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:00,974
Let's get started.
I'll get those.

221
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:08,607
I assumed that we would have
some adult time to ourselves.

222
00:19:11,902 --> 00:19:13,570
What show am I doing, anyway?

223
00:19:21,578 --> 00:19:25,207
Good times and bum times,
I've seen them all

224
00:19:25,207 --> 00:19:29,878
And, my dear,
I'm still here

225
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:35,384
Plush velvet sometimes,
sometimes just pretzels and beer

226
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:38,178
But I'm here

227
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:41,473
I've run the gamut "A" to "Z"

228
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:46,186
Three cheers and damn it,
cest la vie

229
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:49,189
I got through all of last year

230
00:19:49,273 --> 00:19:53,277
And I'm here

231
00:19:53,402 --> 00:19:56,488
Lord knows,
at least I was there

232
00:19:56,572 --> 00:20:00,993
And I'm here

233
00:20:01,076 --> 00:20:05,080
Look who's here

234
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:09,501
I'm still here

235
00:21:01,803 --> 00:21:04,681
- Hi.
- Hi.

236
00:21:11,897 --> 00:21:13,398
My name's Vlad.

237
00:21:16,193 --> 00:21:18,278
I don't mean
to bother you or anything.

238
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:22,491
I just wanted to tell you
how excited I am that you're here.

239
00:21:25,786 --> 00:21:28,288
I did a production
of The Childrehs Crusade

240
00:21:28,372 --> 00:21:29,873
at school this spring.

241
00:21:35,003 --> 00:21:38,173
At first I did it
just to get close to this girl.

242
00:21:38,173 --> 00:21:39,883
But then it was so good.

243
00:21:40,008 --> 00:21:43,971
It really took the characters
of the kids so seriously.

244
00:21:44,096 --> 00:21:47,099
That's really kind of you to say.

245
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,102
That song Sihg for You.

246
00:21:50,102 --> 00:21:52,396
I listened to the record,
like, a hundred times

247
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:54,773
just to get the chords right
on my guitar.

248
00:21:55,899 --> 00:21:59,403
It's not out on CD.
Did you know that?

249
00:21:59,403 --> 00:22:01,697
Yeah, I knew that.

250
00:22:03,073 --> 00:22:06,785
So, what shows have you done
since then, Mr. Hanley?

251
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:10,789
Thank you very much
for coming by to visit, Vlad.

252
00:22:10,873 --> 00:22:14,293
Thank you.
Just give me a break.

253
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:16,378
You little ass-kisser.

254
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:18,088
One, two, three, four.

255
00:22:23,302 --> 00:22:24,678
Quit dragging!

256
00:22:24,803 --> 00:22:27,598
Y'all better get your asses
used to less sleep

257
00:22:27,598 --> 00:22:30,893
'cause we're gonna have
rehearsal all morning.

258
00:22:30,893 --> 00:22:34,980
Then lunch,
then rehearsal.

259
00:22:35,189 --> 00:22:38,108
Then dinner,
then rehearsal.

260
00:22:38,192 --> 00:22:42,404
And the whole thing
starts all over again the next day.

261
00:22:42,487 --> 00:22:44,907
Miss Allen, we've all seen
the beginning of Fame.

262
00:22:46,909 --> 00:22:49,077
Fame. huh?

263
00:22:59,296 --> 00:23:02,591
- They do that on Fame?
- No.

264
00:23:03,592 --> 00:23:07,387
Again!
One, two, three, four.

265
00:23:11,475 --> 00:23:13,101
'Night, Jenna.

266
00:23:16,104 --> 00:23:17,773
Shut up! Start again!

267
00:23:17,898 --> 00:23:21,109
Eyes, eyes, nostrils!
Silent scream!

268
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:31,078
You're really talented.

269
00:23:33,372 --> 00:23:36,208
I don't understand
a single word of this crap,

270
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:38,877
but you do it
with such conviction.

271
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:55,310
A guy like you could have a really
lucky summer in a place like this.

272
00:24:01,692 --> 00:24:03,277
I'm starting to get that idea.

273
00:24:04,987 --> 00:24:08,699
Look. First star.
I know my wish.

274
00:24:11,994 --> 00:24:13,704
Changing the subject.

275
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:17,291
Do you have
any brothers or sisters?

276
00:24:17,374 --> 00:24:22,087
Four brothers...
two older, two younger.

277
00:24:24,089 --> 00:24:27,009
Must be tough when
the middle child is the special one.

278
00:24:27,092 --> 00:24:30,679
- Throws everything out of whack.
- Special? Yeah.

279
00:24:30,804 --> 00:24:33,098
I don't even remember
the last time

280
00:24:33,182 --> 00:24:35,601
my parents called me
by the right name.

281
00:24:39,313 --> 00:24:42,774
- You don't think you're special?
- No.

282
00:24:44,484 --> 00:24:46,195
Seriously.

283
00:24:48,113 --> 00:24:51,074
I don't mean like
dorky boy-band kind of special,

284
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,703
which I'm sure
you get all the time, but...

285
00:24:54,786 --> 00:24:56,788
There's something really there.

286
00:24:58,582 --> 00:25:00,292
Something substantial.

287
00:25:02,211 --> 00:25:05,506
And you deserve
something substantial in return.

288
00:25:12,012 --> 00:25:14,097
Somebody hit me with a rock
so I shut up.

289
00:25:14,097 --> 00:25:18,810
No. Made me feel great.

290
00:25:29,988 --> 00:25:31,073
It's cold.

291
00:25:32,908 --> 00:25:33,992
Come here.

292
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:36,787
That worked.

293
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:43,377
ts 10 a.m.
Everybody should be ih class.

294
00:27:34,196 --> 00:27:35,280
Here we are.

295
00:27:37,699 --> 00:27:38,784
Jeez.

296
00:27:38,909 --> 00:27:40,702
Be it ever so humble...

297
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,414
What's up, Fritzi?

298
00:27:44,414 --> 00:27:48,377
Would you like Fritzi
to fix you a bug juice or something?

299
00:27:52,214 --> 00:27:53,882
No.

300
00:28:00,097 --> 00:28:01,306
Leave us.

301
00:28:06,186 --> 00:28:07,688
Bye, Fritzi.

302
00:28:15,904 --> 00:28:17,406
Does she work for you now?

303
00:28:17,489 --> 00:28:19,908
She likes to do little things for me.

304
00:28:19,992 --> 00:28:22,202
It makes her feel like she belongs.

305
00:28:22,286 --> 00:28:25,414
I'm supposed to be
running lines with Ellen.

306
00:28:25,497 --> 00:28:27,583
She'll have the whole summer to do

307
00:28:27,708 --> 00:28:31,879
that brother-sister bonding thing
she does with all the boys.

308
00:29:03,911 --> 00:29:05,078
Sit.

309
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:19,301
You said you had
a fantastic surprise for me.

310
00:29:20,302 --> 00:29:21,595
What is it?

311
00:29:22,888 --> 00:29:24,306
Surprise.

312
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,398
I'm going to ask
if I can dance with Stella Jolla

313
00:29:33,482 --> 00:29:35,275
in the "Turkey Lurkey" number.

314
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,611
I've been practicing really hard.

315
00:29:38,403 --> 00:29:40,405
That's the part Jill wants to play.

316
00:29:40,489 --> 00:29:42,908
"Turkey Lurkey"
is the best number in the show.

317
00:29:42,908 --> 00:29:46,703
I know.
I took dance classes all winter.

318
00:29:48,497 --> 00:29:49,790
Good for you.

319
00:29:50,791 --> 00:29:55,003
The only thing is, it's a '60s show.
That means tight little miniskirts.

320
00:29:55,087 --> 00:29:57,089
I'm just trying to be a friend.

321
00:29:57,214 --> 00:30:00,092
What are you saying,
that everyone would see my legs?

322
00:30:00,175 --> 00:30:03,512
Not that they're so bad.
They're just a little chunky.

323
00:30:03,595 --> 00:30:05,806
But the halter tops.

324
00:30:05,889 --> 00:30:09,309
I'd worry about my rolls
jiggling around in the spotlight.

325
00:30:09,393 --> 00:30:12,396
Whereas the secretary character
has some great one-liners

326
00:30:12,479 --> 00:30:14,606
and wears sensible suits.

327
00:30:21,613 --> 00:30:22,906
We just love it here.

328
00:30:23,198 --> 00:30:25,284
We see a show every summer.

329
00:30:25,284 --> 00:30:27,286
What did we
see the kids do last year?

330
00:30:28,704 --> 00:30:29,913
Wit.

331
00:30:29,997 --> 00:30:31,290
Wit. right.

332
00:30:31,415 --> 00:30:33,709
Dark, but really entertaining.

333
00:30:41,508 --> 00:30:43,177
It's turkey lurkey time

334
00:30:43,177 --> 00:30:46,889
Tom Turkey ran away,
but he just came home

335
00:30:46,889 --> 00:30:48,682
It's turkey lurkey time

336
00:30:48,682 --> 00:30:52,186
He's really home to stay,
never one to roam

337
00:30:52,186 --> 00:30:56,899
Let's make a wish,
and may all our wishes come true

338
00:30:59,401 --> 00:31:03,405
A snowy, blowy Christmas,
a mistletoey Christmas

339
00:31:03,488 --> 00:31:07,784
A turkey lurkey Christmas to you

340
00:31:07,993 --> 00:31:11,079
A turkey lurkey Christmas to you

341
00:31:13,999 --> 00:31:15,792
It's Loosey Goosey time

342
00:31:15,876 --> 00:31:19,296
She was a gadabout,
but she's back again

343
00:31:19,379 --> 00:31:21,089
It's Loosey Goosey time

344
00:31:21,089 --> 00:31:24,510
Her time is running out,
and we all know when

345
00:31:24,593 --> 00:31:29,389
Let's make a wish,
and may all our wishes come true

346
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:35,896
A snowy, blowy Christmas,
a mistletoey Christmas

347
00:31:35,979 --> 00:31:39,608
A Loosey Goosey Christmas to you

348
00:31:39,816 --> 00:31:42,903
A Loosey Goosey Christmas to you

349
00:31:46,198 --> 00:31:50,410
Turkey lurkey,
Loosey Goosey

350
00:31:50,494 --> 00:31:54,706
Some for Uncle Joe,
some for Cousin Lucy

351
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:56,291
Everybody gather round the table

352
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:58,710
Dig in, dinner's being served

353
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:00,712
Eat all the turkey
you are able

354
00:32:00,712 --> 00:32:02,506
Can't you see a partridge
in a pear tree?

355
00:32:02,589 --> 00:32:06,885
Climb up
and bring it down for me

356
00:32:06,885 --> 00:32:10,305
That's something I would like to see

357
00:32:55,017 --> 00:32:59,313
A snowy, blowy Christmas,
a mistletoey Christmas

358
00:32:59,396 --> 00:33:03,483
A turkey lurkey Christmas to you

359
00:33:09,698 --> 00:33:12,117
Jingle bells, jingle bells

360
00:33:16,914 --> 00:33:20,584
I'm still here

361
00:33:20,709 --> 00:33:22,085
Jingle bells, jingle bells

362
00:33:22,211 --> 00:33:24,296
I'm still here

363
00:33:24,379 --> 00:33:26,507
Jingle bells, jingle bells

364
00:33:51,406 --> 00:33:53,116
Sadness.

365
00:33:57,287 --> 00:34:00,916
Vlad, your cat's dead.
I'm sorry.

366
00:34:02,417 --> 00:34:05,087
He was hit by a car
this afternoon.

367
00:34:06,213 --> 00:34:09,716
Vlad, your mom's dead.
I'm sorry.

368
00:34:09,716 --> 00:34:12,803
She got nailed
by a car this afternoon.

369
00:34:20,978 --> 00:34:22,479
Sorry.

370
00:34:22,479 --> 00:34:24,481
I like to practice in the mirror.

371
00:34:31,905 --> 00:34:33,699
Your parents coming
to your show?

372
00:34:35,617 --> 00:34:37,494
Jesus, you still haven't called 'em?

373
00:34:37,494 --> 00:34:39,580
What are you going to do
when you have to go home?

374
00:34:39,705 --> 00:34:40,998
I'm not going home.

375
00:34:41,081 --> 00:34:44,084
- Where you going to live?
- I'll find an apartment.

376
00:34:44,084 --> 00:34:47,880
- You'll end up on a milk carton.
- They haven't called me, either.

377
00:34:48,005 --> 00:34:51,717
How much you wanna bet
they don't call me on my birthday?

378
00:34:51,717 --> 00:34:53,510
Then you have to be
bigger than them.

379
00:34:56,805 --> 00:34:59,600
How often are you going
to get cast as Romeo?

380
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:02,811
I mean it. Call 'em.

381
00:35:02,895 --> 00:35:06,190
Besides, who can resist you
in them tights?

382
00:35:06,315 --> 00:35:10,194
- Are you blushing?
- You kidding?

383
00:35:10,319 --> 00:35:12,779
I'm doing everything
but bat my eyes.

384
00:35:13,697 --> 00:35:14,907
Call 'em.

385
00:35:28,086 --> 00:35:29,880
Buddy Miller,
sports counselor.

386
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,716
Remember me?
Think fast.

387
00:35:41,892 --> 00:35:44,895
"Dear Mr. Flores,
the school has determined that

388
00:35:44,895 --> 00:35:47,814
"due to your refusal
to wear either a tuxedo

389
00:35:47,898 --> 00:35:51,318
"or an ankle-length formal gown,
you failed to meet the dress code,

390
00:35:51,318 --> 00:35:53,695
"and therefore
appropriate action was taken

391
00:35:53,695 --> 00:35:56,281
in refusing you entrance
to this year's junior prom."

392
00:35:56,406 --> 00:35:58,784
You didn't get in
because of your hemline?

393
00:36:00,786 --> 00:36:03,205
I've been looking all over for you.

394
00:36:13,882 --> 00:36:16,718
- What are you drinking?
- Chicken breast.

395
00:36:16,802 --> 00:36:18,679
Don't you think
that's a little extreme?

396
00:36:18,679 --> 00:36:21,014
It's her parents' idea, the pricks.

397
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:26,103
- It's like some Nazi experiment.
- They're just looking out for me.

398
00:36:26,186 --> 00:36:28,105
You're only a few pounds
heavier than Ellen.

399
00:36:31,191 --> 00:36:34,319
Tell me something...
isn't it a pain in the ass

400
00:36:34,403 --> 00:36:37,406
to put on
all that makeup every day?

401
00:36:37,489 --> 00:36:40,409
I don't mind the extra effort so people
have something nice to look at.

402
00:36:40,492 --> 00:36:42,619
- I think she looks wonderful.
- We know!

403
00:36:42,703 --> 00:36:44,788
Looking good to attract
the opposite sex

404
00:36:44,913 --> 00:36:48,083
has been a basic human impulse
for almost a thousand years.

405
00:36:48,208 --> 00:36:51,503
- What about before that?
- However old the world is.

406
00:36:54,089 --> 00:36:56,508
If you'd soften up a little,
you'd land yourself a boyfriend

407
00:36:56,592 --> 00:36:59,511
and lose that hostile edge
that's so unattractive.

408
00:36:59,511 --> 00:37:01,680
- Drop dead.
- That's the one.

409
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:05,517
I'd be happy to help.
You could be my project.

410
00:37:05,517 --> 00:37:07,603
I'll put you on a diet.
I'll style your hair.

411
00:37:07,686 --> 00:37:09,104
Enough.

412
00:37:09,188 --> 00:37:10,606
I heard about
your little line-learning session.

413
00:37:10,689 --> 00:37:12,900
You got Vlad to put
his arm around you.

414
00:37:12,983 --> 00:37:16,320
That must be like
third base for someone

415
00:37:16,403 --> 00:37:18,906
who's never been touched
by a boy, isn't it?

416
00:37:25,787 --> 00:37:26,997
Ellen, wait.

417
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:30,792
Where do you think
you're going?

418
00:37:32,294 --> 00:37:36,590
You know, I think I know
your sister Cinderella.

419
00:37:51,313 --> 00:37:52,481
There you are.

420
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:56,610
You disappeared so fast.
I looked everywhere for you.

421
00:37:56,693 --> 00:37:58,987
Where's your girlfriend?

422
00:38:00,113 --> 00:38:01,907
She's not my girlfriend.

423
00:38:04,785 --> 00:38:06,495
Why'd you come after me?

424
00:38:09,081 --> 00:38:10,415
I don't know.

425
00:38:11,792 --> 00:38:13,418
'Cause you were upset.

426
00:38:15,212 --> 00:38:17,714
- She's a bitch.
- So was I.

427
00:38:18,715 --> 00:38:20,008
No.

428
00:38:28,183 --> 00:38:29,685
I like you, Ellen.

429
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:48,120
I like you, too.

430
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:03,010
What is it that
we're listening to, anyway?

431
00:39:03,093 --> 00:39:05,012
Nothing.

432
00:39:06,597 --> 00:39:08,182
I can't deal with this anymore.

433
00:39:08,307 --> 00:39:11,894
What?
I like regular music, too.

434
00:39:12,019 --> 00:39:16,106
I like Joni Mitchell.
I know every album by heart.

435
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:18,609
They have this great
new thing called drums.

436
00:39:18,609 --> 00:39:20,402
You're gonna love it.

437
00:39:35,417 --> 00:39:37,503
What's so special about this?

438
00:39:38,921 --> 00:39:41,089
Sometimes it's nice
not to be special.

439
00:39:41,089 --> 00:39:44,218
Sometimes it's nice to listen
to what everyone else listens to

440
00:39:44,301 --> 00:39:45,719
just to be normal for once.

441
00:39:47,596 --> 00:39:50,682
- Dance with me.
- Jump off the roof.

442
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,393
Come on, dance with me.

443
00:40:02,819 --> 00:40:03,820
Asshole!

444
00:40:04,905 --> 00:40:05,989
Just kidding.

445
00:40:06,198 --> 00:40:07,616
Just kidding.

446
00:40:38,397 --> 00:40:40,399
Fiddler oh the Roof?

447
00:40:40,399 --> 00:40:43,110
This is the last straw.
Look at us.

448
00:40:43,193 --> 00:40:45,320
Do we look like
any Jews you know?

449
00:40:45,404 --> 00:40:47,698
You could be Sephardic.

450
00:40:47,781 --> 00:40:50,409
Look at those curly things
on Petie.

451
00:40:51,702 --> 00:40:54,997
I don't think Motel the tailor
used a lot of hair relaxer.

452
00:40:55,122 --> 00:40:57,708
It's color-blind casting.
What do you want me to do?

453
00:40:57,791 --> 00:41:00,210
Porgy ahd Bess?
Brihg ih Da Noise?

454
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:02,212
Why do we have to
play white characters

455
00:41:02,212 --> 00:41:04,214
show after show,
summer after summer?

456
00:41:04,298 --> 00:41:06,592
I don't have enough black kids
to do an all-black show.

457
00:41:06,717 --> 00:41:08,385
I want my little brother learning

458
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:10,596
he can be himself
and still get applause.

459
00:41:10,721 --> 00:41:15,184
You know what I'm saying?
What are you gonna do about it?

460
00:41:19,688 --> 00:41:22,983
And I am telling you

461
00:41:23,108 --> 00:41:26,320
I'm not going

462
00:41:27,487 --> 00:41:30,908
You're the best man
I'll ever know

463
00:41:30,991 --> 00:41:34,494
There's no way
I can ever go

464
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:36,997
No, no, no, no way

465
00:41:36,997 --> 00:41:42,211
No, no, no, no way
I'm living without you

466
00:41:42,294 --> 00:41:44,296
I'm not living without you

467
00:41:46,089 --> 00:41:49,801
I don't wanna be free

468
00:41:49,885 --> 00:41:51,512
I'm staying

469
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,805
I'm staying

470
00:41:53,889 --> 00:41:55,516
And you, and you

471
00:41:56,892 --> 00:42:01,605
You're gonna love me

472
00:42:04,107 --> 00:42:06,693
You're gonna love me

473
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:15,410
And I am telling you

474
00:42:15,494 --> 00:42:17,621
I'm not going

475
00:42:18,622 --> 00:42:21,917
Even though
the rough times are showing

476
00:42:23,001 --> 00:42:25,087
There's just no way

477
00:42:25,212 --> 00:42:27,506
No way

478
00:42:31,301 --> 00:42:32,594
Skateboarding?

479
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,806
For someone with
a name like Vladimir,

480
00:42:35,806 --> 00:42:38,392
you sure are
a clichéd American teenager.

481
00:42:38,392 --> 00:42:41,603
If you don't like it,
stop watching.

482
00:42:41,687 --> 00:42:44,982
I'm not. I'm reading.

483
00:43:02,416 --> 00:43:05,586
Sorry. I'm only human.

484
00:43:05,711 --> 00:43:07,796
Call your parents, Romeo.

485
00:43:09,298 --> 00:43:11,008
Get 'em up here.

486
00:43:17,306 --> 00:43:24,897
And I am telling you

487
00:43:25,022 --> 00:43:28,108
I'm not going

488
00:43:29,318 --> 00:43:31,111
I'm staying

489
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,113
I'm staying

490
00:43:33,197 --> 00:43:36,116
And you, and you, and you

491
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:40,621
You're gonna love me

492
00:43:43,207 --> 00:43:46,919
You're gonna love me

493
00:43:47,002 --> 00:43:48,712
Yes

494
00:43:48,795 --> 00:43:50,005
Love me

495
00:43:51,215 --> 00:43:59,806
You're gonna love me

496
00:44:36,009 --> 00:44:37,386
I envy you.

497
00:44:40,305 --> 00:44:44,101
You've probably known what you
wanted to do since you were born.

498
00:44:50,816 --> 00:44:52,609
When I was eight years old,

499
00:44:52,609 --> 00:44:55,612
I asked my father
to send me to acting class.

500
00:44:55,696 --> 00:44:57,322
And you know what he said?

501
00:44:58,615 --> 00:45:01,410
"There are five billion people
in this world.

502
00:45:02,494 --> 00:45:05,914
"If only one-tenth of one percent
of them want to be actors,

503
00:45:05,914 --> 00:45:08,083
"that's still five million people.

504
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:13,505
"Do you really think you're prettier
than five million people?

505
00:45:15,799 --> 00:45:18,385
You're not even
the prettiest one in your class."

506
00:45:26,018 --> 00:45:28,020
I think you're very pretty.

507
00:45:39,907 --> 00:45:41,909
Why should that make me
want to cry?

508
00:45:50,417 --> 00:45:52,419
I would've asked you
to your prom.

509
00:46:26,203 --> 00:46:27,287
Mom.

510
00:46:30,999 --> 00:46:32,793
I'm sorry,
did I wake you up?

511
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:42,719
It's nice to hear your voice, too.

512
00:46:47,724 --> 00:46:49,017
I miss you too, Mom.

513
00:46:58,110 --> 00:47:00,112
Can you guys
come see my show?

514
00:47:02,698 --> 00:47:04,116
Great.

515
00:47:12,416 --> 00:47:14,084
New cast lists are up.

516
00:47:14,084 --> 00:47:17,004
I got Joanne in Compahy.
You're in it, too.

517
00:47:22,384 --> 00:47:24,011
What are you doing?

518
00:47:25,596 --> 00:47:26,722
Nothing.

519
00:47:27,514 --> 00:47:29,224
What is that?

520
00:47:32,519 --> 00:47:36,523
- Is that my underwear?
- I was just washing them out.

521
00:47:37,608 --> 00:47:39,484
We need to talk.

522
00:47:42,613 --> 00:47:45,115
I think we need
a little break from each other.

523
00:47:45,115 --> 00:47:46,992
What?

524
00:47:47,117 --> 00:47:50,287
It's something I've been meaning
to bring up for a while now.

525
00:47:50,412 --> 00:47:54,291
This whole thing
is beginning to get a little weird.

526
00:47:54,416 --> 00:47:57,002
I don't understand. I've done
everything you've asked me to.

527
00:47:57,085 --> 00:47:59,296
I know, and it's been
a great help,

528
00:47:59,421 --> 00:48:03,425
but the time has come for you
to get some sort of life.

529
00:48:04,384 --> 00:48:07,513
- I have a life.
- Get another one.

530
00:48:07,596 --> 00:48:09,389
I don't know why you're saying this.

531
00:48:09,515 --> 00:48:11,308
- I can be better.
- You're not hearing me.

532
00:48:11,391 --> 00:48:13,393
Test me.
I'll do anything you say.

533
00:48:13,519 --> 00:48:16,313
- You're my best friend!
- Get away from me, you freak!

534
00:48:19,816 --> 00:48:21,401
From now on,

535
00:48:21,401 --> 00:48:24,613
let's just go about our business
and pretend like we never met.

536
00:48:24,696 --> 00:48:26,198
Okay?

537
00:48:26,198 --> 00:48:27,616
I'm going out.

538
00:48:27,616 --> 00:48:30,118
Why don't you be gone
when I get back.

539
00:48:44,216 --> 00:48:46,510
You ready
for our big opening night?

540
00:48:50,013 --> 00:48:52,808
You're very intense
back there in the chorus.

541
00:48:52,891 --> 00:48:54,685
Is everything okay?

542
00:48:56,019 --> 00:48:57,688
I'm a little frustrated.

543
00:48:59,398 --> 00:49:02,109
Frustration's a useless emotion.

544
00:49:02,192 --> 00:49:05,320
If you see something you want,
you just got to go for it.

545
00:49:05,404 --> 00:49:06,697
Easy to say.

546
00:49:08,323 --> 00:49:10,909
It's better to regret
something you have done

547
00:49:10,993 --> 00:49:12,703
than something you haven't done.

548
00:49:12,786 --> 00:49:15,289
- Trust me, I'm the expert.
- Really?

549
00:49:16,999 --> 00:49:21,295
I've been watching you,
and you are a scary little girl.

550
00:49:22,212 --> 00:49:25,090
There's nothing you can't do
if you put your mind to it.

551
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:30,095
Thank you, Mr. Hanley.

552
00:49:31,221 --> 00:49:33,223
You've been very helpful.

553
00:49:40,397 --> 00:49:44,526
Luhch is how beihg seved.
Everybody should be at luhch.

554
00:50:22,189 --> 00:50:25,526
I'd like to propose a toast.

555
00:50:28,612 --> 00:50:32,491
Here's to the ladies who lunch

556
00:50:32,491 --> 00:50:35,118
Everybody laugh

557
00:50:46,922 --> 00:50:48,715
Lounging in their caftans

558
00:50:48,715 --> 00:50:54,596
And planning a brunch
on their own behalf

559
00:51:04,690 --> 00:51:07,025
- I'm going to call it off.
- I think you'd better.

560
00:51:07,109 --> 00:51:08,318
Wait.

561
00:51:11,113 --> 00:51:12,990
What in the hell
are you doing here?

562
00:51:13,115 --> 00:51:15,409
I knew you'd be discussing
stopping the show,

563
00:51:15,492 --> 00:51:18,120
and I just thought how
disappointed the kids would be.

564
00:51:18,203 --> 00:51:22,291
- You scheming little bitch!
- Please! I'm a child.

565
00:51:22,416 --> 00:51:23,792
If you think for one...

566
00:51:23,917 --> 00:51:25,294
Save the speech, rummy.

567
00:51:25,419 --> 00:51:27,296
She's fucked, I'm ready,

568
00:51:27,296 --> 00:51:29,506
and the goddamn show
must go on.

569
00:51:29,590 --> 00:51:32,217
So let's get cracking, shall we?

570
00:51:34,803 --> 00:51:36,388
I'll drink to that

571
00:51:39,725 --> 00:51:42,519
Here's to the girls
who just watch

572
00:51:42,603 --> 00:51:44,688
Aren't they the best?

573
00:51:46,398 --> 00:51:52,696
When they get depressed,
it's a bottle of scotch plus a little jest

574
00:51:55,616 --> 00:51:59,494
Another chance to disapprove

575
00:51:59,494 --> 00:52:03,498
Another brilliant zinger

576
00:52:03,624 --> 00:52:07,503
Another reason not to move

577
00:52:07,628 --> 00:52:10,589
Another vodka stinger

578
00:52:14,092 --> 00:52:16,220
I'll drink to that

579
00:52:19,014 --> 00:52:22,017
So here's to the girls on the go

580
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:24,311
Everybody tries

581
00:52:26,104 --> 00:52:29,816
Look into their eyes
and you'll see what they know

582
00:52:29,816 --> 00:52:34,488
Everybody dies

583
00:52:34,613 --> 00:52:37,491
A toast
to that invincible bunch

584
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:41,495
The dinosaurs
surviving the crunch

585
00:52:42,704 --> 00:52:45,499
Let's hear it
for the ladies who lunch

586
00:52:45,624 --> 00:52:51,004
Everybody rise

587
00:52:51,088 --> 00:52:54,424
Rise

588
00:53:18,824 --> 00:53:22,911
Two households,
both alike in dignity

589
00:53:22,911 --> 00:53:26,415
in fair Verona,
where we lay our scene.

590
00:53:26,498 --> 00:53:30,127
From ancient grudge
break to new mutiny,

591
00:53:30,210 --> 00:53:34,214
where civil blood
makes civil hands unclean.

592
00:53:43,307 --> 00:53:46,518
Romeo, come forth.

593
00:53:46,602 --> 00:53:49,104
Come forth,
thou fearful man.

594
00:53:49,188 --> 00:53:52,024
Affliction is enamored
of thy parts

595
00:53:52,107 --> 00:53:55,194
and thou art wedded
to calamity.

596
00:53:56,403 --> 00:53:59,198
Father, 'tis I, Romeo.

597
00:53:59,323 --> 00:54:01,992
What news?
What is the Prince's doom?

598
00:54:02,117 --> 00:54:04,494
What sorrow
craves acquaintance...

599
00:54:20,010 --> 00:54:23,305
Tell me, Chino...

600
00:54:25,098 --> 00:54:28,018
...how many bullets
are left in this gun?

601
00:54:31,313 --> 00:54:35,526
Enough for you?
And you? And you?

602
00:54:35,609 --> 00:54:38,904
How many can I shoot
and still have one left for me?

603
00:55:12,729 --> 00:55:14,314
Michael, where are you?

604
00:55:29,413 --> 00:55:32,499
Dude, we looked
all over for you.

605
00:55:35,002 --> 00:55:36,712
I heard about what happened.

606
00:55:38,005 --> 00:55:40,090
I called them afterwards...

607
00:55:41,925 --> 00:55:44,094
...to make sure they
weren't dead somewhere

608
00:55:44,094 --> 00:55:45,721
on the New York State Thruway.

609
00:55:50,893 --> 00:55:54,229
My father decided he couldn't
put himself through seeing me.

610
00:55:55,606 --> 00:55:57,191
What does that even mean?

611
00:55:58,525 --> 00:56:00,903
It means they think I'm a freak,

612
00:56:00,903 --> 00:56:03,030
like the kids at my school.

613
00:56:06,116 --> 00:56:08,994
Let's face it, even here
I'm in the upper third.

614
00:56:13,624 --> 00:56:15,918
Why don't you live at home?

615
00:56:16,793 --> 00:56:18,504
Prom night,

616
00:56:18,504 --> 00:56:21,924
my father looked at me
bleeding in a dress.

617
00:56:23,217 --> 00:56:25,511
He told me
I brought it upon myself.

618
00:56:25,594 --> 00:56:28,305
He said that if I did that
when he were in school,

619
00:56:28,430 --> 00:56:31,391
he'd have been one of those boys
kicking my ass, too.

620
00:56:31,517 --> 00:56:33,018
That's crazy.

621
00:56:33,101 --> 00:56:35,395
When it was happening,

622
00:56:35,395 --> 00:56:41,109
I just projected myself out of it,

623
00:56:41,193 --> 00:56:43,529
and in my head
I went somewhere else.

624
00:56:45,322 --> 00:56:46,406
Where?

625
00:56:51,828 --> 00:56:53,121
Here.

626
00:56:59,628 --> 00:57:01,922
Why would you wear a dress
to your prom, dude?

627
00:57:03,006 --> 00:57:05,300
You had to know
you were going to get creamed.

628
00:57:05,425 --> 00:57:09,096
- I don't get that.
- Of course you don't get that.

629
00:57:10,806 --> 00:57:14,393
That's because your life
is pretty damn close to perfect.

630
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:19,398
Mine is like, one from column "A,"
one from column "shit."

631
00:57:21,316 --> 00:57:22,818
Perfect.

632
00:57:30,325 --> 00:57:31,910
How about this?

633
00:57:32,995 --> 00:57:36,206
3, 4, 6, 1,
3, 4, 6, 4, 10,

634
00:57:36,206 --> 00:57:39,418
4, 14, 3, 17, 1, 18,

635
00:57:39,418 --> 00:57:42,713
6, 24, 4, 28, 3, 31, 4.

636
00:57:43,714 --> 00:57:46,925
- What's that?
- Have you ever heard of OCD?

637
00:57:48,719 --> 00:57:50,804
I count letters involuntarily.

638
00:57:50,929 --> 00:57:54,016
That was "one from column 'A,'
one from column 'shit."'

639
00:57:54,099 --> 00:57:55,726
I don't understand.

640
00:57:55,809 --> 00:57:57,019
It's like,

641
00:57:57,102 --> 00:58:01,607
If I don't take my pill,
then every time someone speaks,

642
00:58:01,607 --> 00:58:08,030
or if I have an idea,
or if somebody talks... anything...

643
00:58:08,030 --> 00:58:11,408
I break it down into words,
then into letters,

644
00:58:11,491 --> 00:58:13,327
and I add them up.

645
00:58:14,703 --> 00:58:18,624
3, 1, 3, 4, 2.
"And I add them up."

646
00:58:19,791 --> 00:58:23,420
I take those numbers,
and I add them up backwards.

647
00:58:23,504 --> 00:58:27,925
3, 1, 3, 4, 2
was 6, 3, 9, 1, 10, 3, 13, 4.

648
00:58:28,008 --> 00:58:29,927
The last word,
plus the word before that,

649
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:32,513
plus the word before that,
and on and on...

650
00:58:34,223 --> 00:58:36,308
...till it ends in a prime number.

651
00:58:36,391 --> 00:58:39,603
It's, like, constantly in my head.

652
00:58:40,604 --> 00:58:42,022
I take it all back.

653
00:58:42,898 --> 00:58:44,900
That's the sickest thing
I ever heard.

654
00:58:46,610 --> 00:58:47,903
I know.

655
00:58:49,196 --> 00:58:51,323
It's weird 'cause it's,
like, it's just there.

656
00:58:53,617 --> 00:58:57,120
3, 4, 5, 9, 3, 12, 3.
"It's just there."

657
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:06,213
It's crazy. Oh, my God.

658
00:59:15,597 --> 00:59:18,892
That's why I act.
That's why I want to be an actor.

659
00:59:20,394 --> 00:59:26,400
'Cause when I'm acting,
it's not there if it's really going good.

660
00:59:26,525 --> 00:59:29,111
It's like the character
doesn't have it...

661
00:59:31,530 --> 00:59:33,615
...so I don't have it.

662
00:59:51,592 --> 00:59:53,802
A teenage Prozac junkie.

663
00:59:57,306 --> 00:59:58,807
That's my perfect life.

664
01:00:09,193 --> 01:00:11,111
I guess we're both freaks.

665
01:00:16,408 --> 01:00:18,911
You can take a pill for yours.

666
01:00:18,911 --> 01:00:25,417
I'm still some
teenage drag queen with bad skin

667
01:00:25,501 --> 01:00:29,630
who can't put on a dress without
getting the crap beat out of him.

668
01:00:36,220 --> 01:00:37,804
Let's get out of here, man.

669
01:00:50,609 --> 01:00:54,112
Good morhihg. campers.
Time to rise ahd shihe.

670
01:00:55,030 --> 01:00:59,326
Todays wake-up sohg
is a special bithday dedicatioh

671
01:00:59,326 --> 01:01:01,620
to Michael Flores.

672
01:01:02,621 --> 01:01:04,331
Happy bithday. Michael.

673
01:01:09,002 --> 01:01:11,797
Surprise!

674
01:01:13,715 --> 01:01:15,300
Happy birthday!

675
01:01:28,897 --> 01:01:30,399
Oh, my God, look at you!

676
01:01:39,616 --> 01:01:42,327
The only thing I have to say is,
the hair on my legs better grow back,

677
01:01:42,411 --> 01:01:44,413
or else somebody's getting sued.

678
01:01:44,496 --> 01:01:48,208
- You did not!
- God shave the queen.

679
01:01:49,418 --> 01:01:53,297
Surprise!
Drag Kings "R" Us!

680
01:02:11,815 --> 01:02:13,233
Make a wish.

681
01:02:14,610 --> 01:02:17,613
Right at this moment,
I have everything I want.

682
01:02:18,530 --> 01:02:20,115
So...

683
01:02:21,325 --> 01:02:23,493
I'll give this wish to you guys.

684
01:02:53,398 --> 01:02:56,109
I sing for you

685
01:02:57,402 --> 01:02:59,613
And only you

686
01:02:59,613 --> 01:03:04,409
Wherever I go, I find you

687
01:03:07,329 --> 01:03:11,708
You're in the sound
of every "hello"

688
01:03:12,709 --> 01:03:15,712
In everything I do

689
01:03:17,714 --> 01:03:21,426
You're the song
I was destined to know

690
01:03:22,427 --> 01:03:26,723
And I only sing for you

691
01:03:33,897 --> 01:03:37,317
You went away

692
01:03:37,401 --> 01:03:40,112
I should have known

693
01:03:40,195 --> 01:03:44,825
You'd leave so many dreams
behind you

694
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:52,124
Thought I'd be fine
just being alone

695
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:56,503
I didn't have a clue

696
01:03:57,629 --> 01:04:02,134
But my heart
had a mind of its own

697
01:04:03,218 --> 01:04:08,015
And would only sing for you

698
01:04:14,229 --> 01:04:18,901
You're in the sound of rain

699
01:04:28,493 --> 01:04:29,828
Who are you people?

700
01:04:29,912 --> 01:04:32,915
What planet did you
beam down from?

701
01:04:35,918 --> 01:04:37,127
I'm serious.

702
01:04:39,213 --> 01:04:41,215
If I can teach you one thing,

703
01:04:41,298 --> 01:04:43,634
which is supposed
to be my job here...

704
01:04:44,927 --> 01:04:47,721
...it'd be that
you should all go home.

705
01:04:49,097 --> 01:04:53,602
Michael Bennett's dead.
Bob Fosse is dead.

706
01:04:53,727 --> 01:04:57,814
Times Square
is a theme park now.

707
01:04:59,733 --> 01:05:01,527
I hate to be the Grinch,

708
01:05:01,610 --> 01:05:04,112
but it's not normal
what goes on up here.

709
01:05:04,905 --> 01:05:07,616
Somebody has got to warn you.

710
01:05:07,699 --> 01:05:11,119
Teenage faghags
become adult faghags.

711
01:05:12,829 --> 01:05:14,206
Straight boys are straight.

712
01:05:14,331 --> 01:05:18,126
You can't turn 'em
just because you need to be loved.

713
01:05:18,126 --> 01:05:20,212
The foundation
that's being laid here

714
01:05:20,212 --> 01:05:23,632
is not going to help you
in the real world.

715
01:05:23,715 --> 01:05:28,512
It's going to lead to
waitressing jobs and bitterness

716
01:05:28,595 --> 01:05:33,308
and the obsessive,
pointless collecting

717
01:05:33,308 --> 01:05:37,521
of out-of-print
original cast albums.

718
01:05:49,032 --> 01:05:51,618
I don't know what your problem is,
and I don't really care.

719
01:05:51,618 --> 01:05:54,496
Maybe you're a son of a bitch
just 'cause you haven't written a show

720
01:05:54,621 --> 01:05:56,498
in, like, a million years.

721
01:05:56,623 --> 01:05:58,500
Or maybe you're
just a stupid drunk,

722
01:05:58,625 --> 01:06:00,627
but those kids,
they look up to you.

723
01:06:00,711 --> 01:06:03,213
And they don't deserve
to be treated like that.

724
01:06:03,213 --> 01:06:06,508
"They"? Did you think
I wasn't talking to you, too?

725
01:06:06,633 --> 01:06:08,135
Or did I forget to mention that

726
01:06:08,135 --> 01:06:11,513
you're a fraud who has to be
everybody's golden boy,

727
01:06:11,597 --> 01:06:13,307
or you'll just shrivel up?

728
01:06:13,432 --> 01:06:15,100
I've taken shots at drunks before.

729
01:06:15,225 --> 01:06:17,311
Don't think I have some
honor code about it.

730
01:06:17,394 --> 01:06:18,729
Bring it on.

731
01:06:20,606 --> 01:06:22,232
What is your problem?

732
01:06:22,316 --> 01:06:23,901
I don't have a problem.

733
01:06:25,527 --> 01:06:28,030
There's a theater in Brooklyn
that's got a problem.

734
01:06:28,113 --> 01:06:30,824
Seems they need
a rehearsal pianist,

735
01:06:30,824 --> 01:06:35,204
and they thought I might just be
hard up enough to oblige.

736
01:06:35,329 --> 01:06:38,832
So I sit in hot, stinking traffic
for three hours

737
01:06:38,832 --> 01:06:41,210
just to drive down there
to find out it's not

738
01:06:41,210 --> 01:06:44,922
the 200th revival
of my one hit show they wanted.

739
01:06:45,005 --> 01:06:49,009
You should never meet your heroes.
They always disappoint you.

740
01:06:49,134 --> 01:06:52,012
Come on, kid.
Come here. Help me out.

741
01:06:53,514 --> 01:06:54,932
I think I'm going to be sick.

742
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:01,021
Oh, Jesus!

743
01:07:01,522 --> 01:07:02,898
God!

744
01:07:52,197 --> 01:07:53,699
Get it away.

745
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:56,326
You don't even know what it is.

746
01:07:56,410 --> 01:07:59,621
I don't care. If it's been
touched by him, it's diseased.

747
01:08:02,499 --> 01:08:04,418
- Oh, my God.
- Spit.

748
01:08:09,006 --> 01:08:11,717
It's everything he's written
since The Childrehs Crusade.

749
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:13,927
There's a ton more at his place.

750
01:08:13,927 --> 01:08:17,014
It's like the Holy Grail
of musical theater.

751
01:08:18,932 --> 01:08:20,809
This one doesn't look so good.

752
01:08:20,934 --> 01:08:23,729
Some are lousy,
but most of 'em are great.

753
01:08:25,022 --> 01:08:27,608
It's like they don't even
seem like they're from shows.

754
01:08:27,733 --> 01:08:29,318
They're just songs he wrote.

755
01:08:30,402 --> 01:08:32,029
There's funk, gospel.

756
01:08:33,030 --> 01:08:36,617
There's this awesome,
rootsy Neil Young song.

757
01:08:39,119 --> 01:08:40,829
Come on. Neil Young?

758
01:08:44,499 --> 01:08:47,836
He doesn't know I took 'em.
They're just copies.

759
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:49,630
What are you going
to do with them?

760
01:08:49,713 --> 01:08:52,508
What time's that benefit rehearsal
start tomorrow?

761
01:08:52,633 --> 01:08:54,134
12:00 to 3:00.

762
01:08:55,135 --> 01:08:56,303
That's it?

763
01:08:56,428 --> 01:08:59,431
Ever since Michael's drag party,
Glen's been on a crusade

764
01:08:59,515 --> 01:09:01,433
to make us
more like a normal camp,

765
01:09:01,517 --> 01:09:05,229
so he's cutting back the benefit
rehearsals to three hours a day.

766
01:09:05,312 --> 01:09:06,730
That's enough time.

767
01:09:07,523 --> 01:09:11,109
- Time for what?
- He'll be late. He's always late.

768
01:09:11,109 --> 01:09:12,110
For...?

769
01:09:13,237 --> 01:09:14,196
Come on.

770
01:09:36,009 --> 01:09:39,304
Outside my house
is a cactus plant

771
01:09:39,304 --> 01:09:42,307
They call the century tree

772
01:09:42,307 --> 01:09:45,310
Only once in a hundred years

773
01:09:45,310 --> 01:09:47,896
It flowers gracefully

774
01:09:47,896 --> 01:09:52,901
And you never know
when it will bloom

775
01:09:54,236 --> 01:10:02,035
Hey, do you want
to come out and play the game?

776
01:10:02,119 --> 01:10:05,831
It's never too late

777
01:10:06,999 --> 01:10:14,631
Hey, do you want
to come out and play the game?

778
01:10:14,715 --> 01:10:17,926
It's never too late

779
01:10:20,304 --> 01:10:27,227
Clementine Hunter was 54
before she packed up her paint

780
01:10:32,316 --> 01:10:35,402
Old Uncle Taylor was 81

781
01:10:35,527 --> 01:10:40,407
When he rode his bike
across the plains of China

782
01:10:44,036 --> 01:10:48,832
And the sun
was shining on that day

783
01:10:48,916 --> 01:10:50,626
Just like today

784
01:10:50,709 --> 01:10:57,216
Do you want to come out
and play the game?

785
01:10:57,299 --> 01:11:01,512
It's never too late

786
01:11:02,513 --> 01:11:09,811
Hey, do you want
to come out and play the game?

787
01:11:09,937 --> 01:11:14,399
It's never too late

788
01:11:18,237 --> 01:11:23,909
Didn't know how to tell her
for over 30 years

789
01:11:24,034 --> 01:11:29,998
He kept locked up inside himself,
and no one saw the tears

790
01:11:30,123 --> 01:11:36,713
Then she went away,
and he woke up that day

791
01:11:36,839 --> 01:11:40,634
Now he brings roses
to his sweetheart

792
01:11:40,634 --> 01:11:43,720
She lives most anywhere

793
01:11:43,804 --> 01:11:46,932
He sees someone suffering

794
01:11:47,015 --> 01:11:50,227
He knows that despair

795
01:11:50,310 --> 01:11:56,024
He offers them a rose
and some quiet prose

796
01:11:56,108 --> 01:12:01,530
'Bout dancing
in a shimmering ballroom

797
01:12:01,613 --> 01:12:07,327
'Cause you never know
when they will bloom

798
01:12:08,704 --> 01:12:16,003
Hey, do you want
to come out and play the game?

799
01:12:16,128 --> 01:12:21,133
It's never too late
to play the game

800
01:12:21,216 --> 01:12:28,515
Hey, do you want
to come out and play the game?

801
01:12:28,515 --> 01:12:30,434
It's never too late

802
01:12:30,517 --> 01:12:33,228
Never too late to play the game

803
01:12:33,312 --> 01:12:39,401
Hey, do you want
to come out and play the game?

804
01:12:39,526 --> 01:12:42,738
And play the game,
it's never too late

805
01:12:42,821 --> 01:12:44,615
Never too late

806
01:12:45,407 --> 01:12:52,623
Hey, do you want
to come out and play the game?

807
01:12:52,706 --> 01:12:55,000
And play...

808
01:12:58,003 --> 01:13:05,219
Hey, do you want
to come out and play the game?

809
01:13:05,302 --> 01:13:07,930
It's never too late

810
01:13:07,930 --> 01:13:10,599
It's never too late,
never too late

811
01:13:10,724 --> 01:13:17,523
Hey, do you want
to come out and play the game?

812
01:13:17,523 --> 01:13:20,526
It's never too late

813
01:13:20,734 --> 01:13:22,611
It's never too late

814
01:13:22,736 --> 01:13:30,327
Hey, do you want
to come out and play the game?

815
01:13:30,410 --> 01:13:34,915
It's never too late

816
01:13:34,998 --> 01:13:41,421
Hey, do you want
to come out and play the game?

817
01:13:41,505 --> 01:13:44,007
Wanna come out,
wanna come out

818
01:13:44,132 --> 01:13:47,010
It's never too late

819
01:14:13,912 --> 01:14:16,707
I ever tell you we did
The Childrehs Crusade?

820
01:14:16,832 --> 01:14:20,627
Five summers ago.
It was good.

821
01:14:20,711 --> 01:14:25,007
The kids want to do a revue
of my music for the benefit.

822
01:14:25,132 --> 01:14:27,801
I heard.
What did you tell them?

823
01:14:28,802 --> 01:14:32,139
- I told them yeah.
- Good. I'm glad.

824
01:14:32,222 --> 01:14:34,725
But not on
three hours' rehearsal a day.

825
01:14:34,808 --> 01:14:38,020
You tell me, am I wrong?
Am I doing such a horrible thing?

826
01:14:38,103 --> 01:14:40,731
I don't know.

827
01:14:40,731 --> 01:14:43,817
I was like you, except I was
feeling sorry for myself,

828
01:14:43,901 --> 01:14:47,029
and I thought these kids
needed a hard dose of reality,

829
01:14:47,029 --> 01:14:49,406
so I gave it to them.
Both barrels.

830
01:14:51,116 --> 01:14:54,620
But I've been watching them,
and I was wrong.

831
01:14:55,913 --> 01:14:58,040
They're a bunch of little freaks.

832
01:14:59,124 --> 01:15:01,210
The more normal
we try to make them,

833
01:15:01,335 --> 01:15:04,505
the more lonely and isolated
they're gonna feel.

834
01:15:10,302 --> 01:15:12,721
Summer is almost over, Glen.

835
01:15:14,806 --> 01:15:17,309
Let's all go out like pros.
What do you say?

836
01:16:39,433 --> 01:16:41,602
Dee, ehtra.

837
01:16:45,522 --> 01:16:47,524
What are you doing here?

838
01:16:50,903 --> 01:16:52,613
Look, I don't speak no Spanish,

839
01:16:52,613 --> 01:16:54,531
so you better habla your ass
some English.

840
01:16:56,033 --> 01:16:59,328
Peter Piper picked a peck
of pickled peppers. Add that one.

841
01:17:00,037 --> 01:17:03,207
- Cut it out, dude.
- I'm gonna cure you.

842
01:17:03,332 --> 01:17:05,417
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.

843
01:17:05,501 --> 01:17:07,127
Why are you in a good mood?

844
01:17:07,127 --> 01:17:11,131
- You want to know?
- Yeah.

845
01:17:14,218 --> 01:17:15,427
What is that?

846
01:17:20,224 --> 01:17:21,433
No way.

847
01:17:24,436 --> 01:17:26,939
- Who?
- Dee.

848
01:17:27,940 --> 01:17:30,025
Dee? You slept with a girl?

849
01:17:31,818 --> 01:17:33,403
You slept with a girl?

850
01:17:33,529 --> 01:17:35,739
You're so full of shit.
I don't believe you.

851
01:17:35,822 --> 01:17:37,741
I mean, why would you?

852
01:17:37,824 --> 01:17:42,829
Maybe I didn't want a whole lifetime
of feeling the way I have so far.

853
01:17:46,542 --> 01:17:48,001
I'm asking Dee.

854
01:17:49,002 --> 01:17:51,505
- Don't.
- I'm calling your bluff.

855
01:17:51,630 --> 01:17:54,216
- Don't be a jerk.
- What're you gonna do?

856
01:18:10,607 --> 01:18:11,942
Ellen's not here.

857
01:18:11,942 --> 01:18:15,028
I know. What are you doing?

858
01:18:16,530 --> 01:18:17,823
A journal.

859
01:18:27,207 --> 01:18:29,710
Oh, my God!

860
01:18:32,921 --> 01:18:35,424
- Michael told me.
- That punk!

861
01:18:35,507 --> 01:18:37,801
I'm going to give him
a bitch slap so hard.

862
01:18:37,801 --> 01:18:42,306
- This is the trippiest thing I ever...
- All right.

863
01:18:42,306 --> 01:18:46,310
Could he do it, even?
Were his eyes open?

864
01:18:46,310 --> 01:18:47,936
Nothing against you, it's just...

865
01:18:48,020 --> 01:18:50,814
If you wanna know, he talked
about you most of the time.

866
01:18:50,939 --> 01:18:52,316
During?

867
01:18:52,316 --> 01:18:54,818
Who knows?
I finally tuned him out.

868
01:18:57,112 --> 01:19:01,533
Come on.
Seriously, tell me.

869
01:19:02,534 --> 01:19:04,536
Why are you
so interested, anyway?

870
01:19:04,536 --> 01:19:08,332
- What's going on with you two?
- Nothing. Why?

871
01:19:08,415 --> 01:19:10,125
What did he say?

872
01:19:10,209 --> 01:19:13,921
I'm just saying you guys
hang out an awful lot.

873
01:19:13,921 --> 01:19:16,507
So what? I'm straight.

874
01:19:18,342 --> 01:19:20,511
- Straight.
- All right.

875
01:19:21,803 --> 01:19:25,724
- You don't believe me?
- All I'm saying is that people talk.

876
01:19:37,736 --> 01:19:40,531
Sorry. That was stupid.

877
01:19:41,823 --> 01:19:45,202
It wasn't that stupid.
Do you know how long it's been

878
01:19:45,327 --> 01:19:47,704
since a guy's liked me
that wasn't gay?

879
01:19:48,413 --> 01:19:50,040
I don't like you.

880
01:19:50,832 --> 01:19:53,627
I mean, I like you,
but that's not why I did that.

881
01:19:56,421 --> 01:19:58,340
I don't know why I did that.

882
01:20:01,009 --> 01:20:02,427
It's all right.

883
01:20:05,013 --> 01:20:06,223
Wait.

884
01:20:07,307 --> 01:20:08,934
You just slept with Michael.

885
01:20:09,017 --> 01:20:13,021
I'm sorry.
Then go back to your boyfriend.

886
01:20:13,105 --> 01:20:16,024
- Shut up.
- Why don't you make me?

887
01:20:33,417 --> 01:20:34,710
Shit!

888
01:20:40,424 --> 01:20:42,426
Come on, wait up!

889
01:20:43,719 --> 01:20:44,803
Leave me alone.

890
01:20:44,928 --> 01:20:47,723
- Wait up!
- Don't follow me!

891
01:21:12,122 --> 01:21:14,917
- Oh, baby!
- Doesn't she look pretty?

892
01:21:15,042 --> 01:21:17,503
- I missed you so much!
- You look so beautiful.

893
01:21:23,634 --> 01:21:26,428
I don't understand.
How can you spend all summer

894
01:21:26,512 --> 01:21:28,931
with your jaw wired shut
and still look like that?

895
01:21:29,014 --> 01:21:30,807
Fred!

896
01:21:31,642 --> 01:21:34,228
I'll tell you what,
we'll keep it on for fall term.

897
01:21:34,311 --> 01:21:37,231
You won't be sneaking milkshakes
with me around the house.

898
01:21:38,815 --> 01:21:40,526
I have to get ready.

899
01:21:41,443 --> 01:21:42,611
What?

900
01:22:22,609 --> 01:22:27,531
Oh, my God, it's him.
Stephen Sondheim.

901
01:23:35,516 --> 01:23:38,727
They called places already.
You're not even dressed yet?

902
01:23:49,238 --> 01:23:51,406
How paranoid can you be?

903
01:24:00,415 --> 01:24:01,708
Oh, my God.

904
01:24:03,043 --> 01:24:06,505
Was that your plan?
Did you put something in there?

905
01:24:06,630 --> 01:24:09,341
I only wish I'd thought of it.

906
01:24:13,136 --> 01:24:15,639
Can you please pass the base?

907
01:24:22,229 --> 01:24:24,439
- Thank you.
- This is ridiculous.

908
01:24:24,523 --> 01:24:25,941
If you say one more syllable,

909
01:24:25,941 --> 01:24:28,318
I will shove a powder puff
down your windpipe...

910
01:24:28,443 --> 01:24:31,613
Do not underestimate my ass,
because I will knock you flat.

911
01:24:31,613 --> 01:24:33,323
- Girls, why don't we...
- Butt out.

912
01:24:33,407 --> 01:24:35,617
And there's no such thing
as bisexuality, you know.

913
01:24:38,620 --> 01:24:42,916
- Julie? What are you doing here?
- I took the bus.

914
01:24:51,425 --> 01:24:52,843
How are you?

915
01:24:52,843 --> 01:24:54,720
- I'm good. How about you?
- Good.

916
01:24:54,720 --> 01:24:57,431
- I give up.
- You give up?

917
01:25:01,935 --> 01:25:05,022
Julie, this is Ellen,
Michael, and Dee.

918
01:25:06,106 --> 01:25:08,442
Listen, is there
somewhere private we can go?

919
01:25:08,525 --> 01:25:10,444
Right now? I have a show.

920
01:25:10,444 --> 01:25:12,905
- I'll see you after, okay?
- Great.

921
01:25:15,115 --> 01:25:16,325
- Bye.
- Bye.

922
01:25:40,307 --> 01:25:44,019
- What?
- I hardly know where to begin.

923
01:25:45,312 --> 01:25:47,523
Why didn't you tell us
you had a girlfriend?

924
01:25:47,523 --> 01:25:48,607
You didn't ask.

925
01:25:48,732 --> 01:25:50,317
You never asked me
if I had a boyfriend,

926
01:25:50,442 --> 01:25:52,819
but if I did,
I would've said something...

927
01:25:58,909 --> 01:26:01,620
Except you assumed
I wouldn't have a boyfriend.

928
01:26:04,915 --> 01:26:06,041
Right.

929
01:26:06,834 --> 01:26:10,546
No sense in asking a question
like that to someone like me, right?

930
01:26:10,629 --> 01:26:11,630
Stop it.

931
01:26:11,713 --> 01:26:15,133
And I was supposed to assume
that you did have a girlfriend.

932
01:26:15,843 --> 01:26:17,928
And of course that you screw around.

933
01:26:18,011 --> 01:26:20,013
That's not true.
I'm sorry about Dee.

934
01:26:20,138 --> 01:26:23,016
It's just...
I have no excuse.

935
01:26:24,142 --> 01:26:25,644
It's all my fault.

936
01:26:26,728 --> 01:26:29,314
Maybe you and I only went out

937
01:26:29,439 --> 01:26:32,609
because I thought
it would make you happy.

938
01:26:32,734 --> 01:26:34,111
I'm sorry.

939
01:26:34,236 --> 01:26:35,529
Right.

940
01:26:36,822 --> 01:26:40,117
I knew that.
I knew that all along.

941
01:26:41,535 --> 01:26:43,328
I guess I just didn't care.

942
01:26:44,329 --> 01:26:46,832
But tell me one thing.

943
01:26:48,917 --> 01:26:52,546
What was going to happen to us
when we got back home?

944
01:26:52,629 --> 01:26:54,131
Places!

945
01:27:27,414 --> 01:27:31,543
Jesus Christ!
Oh, God!

946
01:27:32,836 --> 01:27:36,215
You sabotaged my makeup!
You bitch!

947
01:27:36,340 --> 01:27:37,841
I did not. Sit down.

948
01:27:44,306 --> 01:27:46,016
- I can't do it.
- Come on, Jenna.

949
01:27:46,016 --> 01:27:47,809
Fritzi's got multiple fractures,

950
01:27:47,935 --> 01:27:51,021
and Jill's face looks like
40 miles of bad road.

951
01:27:51,146 --> 01:27:52,523
You've got to do it.

952
01:27:54,816 --> 01:27:56,443
I know you're scared.

953
01:27:58,529 --> 01:27:59,947
It's not that.

954
01:28:01,114 --> 01:28:02,616
My parents are here.

955
01:28:04,326 --> 01:28:06,828
It's about time
they met their daughter.

956
01:28:33,730 --> 01:28:38,735
Here in the dark
I stand before you

957
01:28:38,819 --> 01:28:45,033
You know this is my chance
to show you my heart

958
01:28:45,117 --> 01:28:47,619
This is the start

959
01:28:47,828 --> 01:28:52,541
This is the start

960
01:28:52,624 --> 01:28:55,544
I have so much to say

961
01:28:55,627 --> 01:29:02,634
And I'm hoping
that your arms are open

962
01:29:02,718 --> 01:29:06,722
Don't turn away,
I want you near me

963
01:29:06,722 --> 01:29:11,310
But you have to hear me

964
01:29:11,310 --> 01:29:16,815
Here's where I stand,
here's who I am

965
01:29:16,940 --> 01:29:22,738
Love me, but don't tell me
who I have to be

966
01:29:22,738 --> 01:29:29,745
Here's who I am,
I'm what you see

967
01:29:29,745 --> 01:29:35,042
You said I had to change,
and I was trying

968
01:29:35,125 --> 01:29:39,922
But my heart was lying

969
01:29:39,922 --> 01:29:44,218
I'm not a child any longer

970
01:29:44,343 --> 01:29:50,933
I am stronger

971
01:29:50,933 --> 01:29:56,647
Here's where I stand,
here's who I am

972
01:29:56,730 --> 01:29:59,525
Help me to move on

973
01:29:59,608 --> 01:30:02,444
But please don't tell me how

974
01:30:02,444 --> 01:30:10,410
I'm on my way,
I'm moving now

975
01:30:11,328 --> 01:30:15,541
In this life we've come so far

976
01:30:15,624 --> 01:30:19,628
But we're only who we are

977
01:30:19,711 --> 01:30:24,842
With the courage of love
to show us the way

978
01:30:24,925 --> 01:30:34,142
We've got the power
to stand up and say

979
01:30:35,227 --> 01:30:43,527
Here's where I stand,
here's who I am

980
01:30:43,527 --> 01:30:46,530
Stand up and be counted

981
01:30:46,530 --> 01:30:49,533
I'm counting on you

982
01:30:49,533 --> 01:30:56,331
If you're with me,
we'll make it through

983
01:30:56,415 --> 01:31:01,837
Here's where I stand,
here's who I am

984
01:31:01,837 --> 01:31:05,716
Love me, love me, love me

985
01:31:05,716 --> 01:31:08,010
And we'll make it through

986
01:31:08,135 --> 01:31:11,847
Here's where I stand

987
01:31:11,847 --> 01:31:17,311
Baby, baby, baby,
I'm counting on you

988
01:31:17,436 --> 01:31:21,148
Here's where I stand

989
01:31:21,148 --> 01:31:24,443
Love me, love me, love me

990
01:31:24,526 --> 01:31:30,949
And we'll make it through

991
01:31:31,033 --> 01:31:35,037
I'm counting

992
01:31:36,413 --> 01:31:40,542
Oh, I'm counting

993
01:31:40,542 --> 01:31:43,045
I'm counting

994
01:31:43,045 --> 01:31:46,131
I'm counting on

995
01:31:51,220 --> 01:31:56,141
You

996
01:31:56,225 --> 01:32:02,314
Here's where I stand,
here's who I am

997
01:32:02,314 --> 01:32:04,316
I'm counting on you

998
01:32:04,441 --> 01:32:06,443
I'm counting on you

999
01:32:06,527 --> 01:32:12,241
Here's where I stand,
here's who I am

1000
01:32:12,324 --> 01:32:13,909
We'll make it through

1001
01:32:14,034 --> 01:32:19,039
Here's where I stand,
here's who I am

1002
01:32:19,122 --> 01:32:22,125
Here's who I am,
I'm counting on you

1003
01:32:22,209 --> 01:32:24,336
I'm counting on you

1004
01:32:24,419 --> 01:32:27,130
Here's where I stand

1005
01:32:27,214 --> 01:32:30,634
Here's who I am

1006
01:32:30,717 --> 01:32:32,928
We'll make it through

1007
01:32:33,011 --> 01:32:35,347
Here's where I stand

1008
01:32:35,430 --> 01:32:39,726
Here's who I am

1009
01:32:39,726 --> 01:32:41,520
I'm counting on you

1010
01:32:41,728 --> 01:32:43,939
I'm counting on you

1011
01:32:43,939 --> 01:32:46,441
Here's where I stand

1012
01:32:48,735 --> 01:32:51,321
We'll make it through

1013
01:32:51,321 --> 01:32:57,411
Here's where I stand,
here's who I am

1014
01:32:57,536 --> 01:33:00,539
I'm counting on you

1015
01:33:00,622 --> 01:33:07,421
Here's where I stand,
here's who I am

1016
01:33:25,814 --> 01:33:29,026
Good job, Bert.
Really terrific.

1017
01:33:31,820 --> 01:33:36,241
Thank you. I had no idea
you chaired this benefit.

1018
01:33:36,325 --> 01:33:39,036
I'm giving a party on the 18th.
I'll give you a call.

1019
01:33:39,119 --> 01:33:41,538
Great. Love to.

1020
01:34:02,226 --> 01:34:03,435
Who's that?

1021
01:34:05,812 --> 01:34:07,439
Go away.

1022
01:34:27,709 --> 01:34:30,712
- What are you doing?
- I'm going swimming.

1023
01:34:30,838 --> 01:34:33,048
Don't! I don't
even want to talk to you!

1024
01:34:40,222 --> 01:34:42,432
I want to apologize.

1025
01:34:52,442 --> 01:34:54,945
You are either the biggest
closet case I've ever seen,

1026
01:34:55,028 --> 01:34:57,030
or you're just plain evil.

1027
01:34:57,114 --> 01:34:59,241
Why? I thought now
that you're straight...

1028
01:34:59,241 --> 01:35:00,951
Don't get carried away.

1029
01:35:00,951 --> 01:35:04,746
- I slept with her 'cause of you.
- Me?

1030
01:35:04,746 --> 01:35:06,748
I figured you might
feel less threatened

1031
01:35:06,832 --> 01:35:09,251
if you thought I was capable
of sex with a woman.

1032
01:35:09,251 --> 01:35:12,045
I don't even know how
to respond to that, dude.

1033
01:35:12,129 --> 01:35:13,630
With a straitjacket, perhaps?

1034
01:35:18,135 --> 01:35:21,430
Things went so good with Dee.
Isn't it just possible that you're...

1035
01:35:21,513 --> 01:35:22,514
No.

1036
01:35:24,433 --> 01:35:28,228
The only thing that's possible now
is I'll get beat up once too often

1037
01:35:28,312 --> 01:35:31,023
and decide to be with some woman
because I know I can.

1038
01:35:32,733 --> 01:35:34,943
It's not exactly something
I wish I knew.

1039
01:35:34,943 --> 01:35:36,737
You can't pin that on me.

1040
01:35:36,820 --> 01:35:40,032
We can't pin anything on you
'cause you're perfect.

1041
01:35:40,115 --> 01:35:41,325
I'm not perfect!

1042
01:35:41,450 --> 01:35:44,912
Except for that little
obsessive-compulsive thing.

1043
01:35:45,037 --> 01:35:47,039
Even that makes you
kind of sexily damaged.

1044
01:35:47,122 --> 01:35:50,626
I hate people like you.
I really do.

1045
01:36:18,946 --> 01:36:20,739
Oh, my God.

1046
01:36:28,038 --> 01:36:29,748
Water's freezing.

1047
01:36:30,916 --> 01:36:33,043
Why are you doing this?

1048
01:36:33,043 --> 01:36:36,129
Doing what?
Skinny-dipping.

1049
01:36:39,424 --> 01:36:42,511
Maybe I do flirt, but if I do,

1050
01:36:42,636 --> 01:36:44,429
it's only because
I want to be liked.

1051
01:36:46,515 --> 01:36:49,518
And... maybe I'm
a little confused.

1052
01:37:03,615 --> 01:37:05,534
You're not confused.

1053
01:37:07,828 --> 01:37:09,037
You like girls.

1054
01:37:12,833 --> 01:37:15,043
You're right. I do.

1055
01:37:15,127 --> 01:37:17,337
I was just trying
to give you what you want.

1056
01:37:17,421 --> 01:37:18,422
I'm an asshole.

1057
01:37:18,422 --> 01:37:21,925
Man, I don't know.
I just love attention.

1058
01:37:22,050 --> 01:37:24,428
I'm an attention junkie, I guess.

1059
01:37:26,221 --> 01:37:28,724
Why do I do shit like that?

1060
01:37:35,147 --> 01:37:36,648
Do you forgive me?

1061
01:37:40,819 --> 01:37:42,237
Do you?

1062
01:37:45,949 --> 01:37:47,326
Come on!

1063
01:37:55,042 --> 01:37:57,127
Do you? Do you forgive me?

1064
01:37:59,213 --> 01:38:00,547
Do you?

1065
01:38:00,631 --> 01:38:02,424
If I forgive you,
will you get off of me?

1066
01:38:02,549 --> 01:38:03,926
- Yeah.
- Then no.

1067
01:38:05,135 --> 01:38:06,929
Oh, God.

1068
01:38:11,934 --> 01:38:14,728
Michael, who are you with?

1069
01:38:20,025 --> 01:38:23,529
Don't hate me.
I made up with him.

1070
01:38:28,534 --> 01:38:29,743
Where's Julie?

1071
01:38:32,412 --> 01:38:34,540
- She broke up with me.
- What?

1072
01:38:34,623 --> 01:38:37,543
She came here 'cause
she wanted to tell me in person.

1073
01:38:37,626 --> 01:38:41,839
Well, well, well. How's that
for a little opening night present?

1074
01:38:42,923 --> 01:38:45,425
How does it feel to be
on the other end, lover boy?

1075
01:38:47,135 --> 01:38:48,637
Actually...

1076
01:38:50,848 --> 01:38:53,642
- Never mind.
- What?

1077
01:38:57,229 --> 01:38:58,814
Now that camp's almost over,

1078
01:38:58,939 --> 01:39:02,025
and we live
kind of close to each other,

1079
01:39:02,150 --> 01:39:06,238
I was hoping that
we can go out sometime.

1080
01:39:09,116 --> 01:39:12,244
I know you're not asking
girlfriend out for a date after all this.

1081
01:39:12,327 --> 01:39:14,121
If she'll forgive me.

1082
01:39:17,833 --> 01:39:19,626
This boy not only has cojohes.

1083
01:39:19,626 --> 01:39:22,045
but he's got burritos
and huevos rancheros, too.

1084
01:39:26,717 --> 01:39:28,844
- Okay.
- What?

1085
01:39:28,927 --> 01:39:30,137
Really?

1086
01:39:31,221 --> 01:39:32,431
I'll go out with you.

1087
01:39:32,514 --> 01:39:35,851
You're like
some Jenny Jones guest!

1088
01:39:35,934 --> 01:39:38,937
Eventually I have to start
hanging out with boys

1089
01:39:39,021 --> 01:39:40,647
who don't wear dresses.

1090
01:39:42,524 --> 01:39:44,651
I thought we came here
to go swimming.

1091
01:39:50,532 --> 01:39:51,742
You coming in?

1092
01:39:53,118 --> 01:39:54,453
It's pretty cold.

1093
01:39:55,537 --> 01:39:57,831
I'll take my chances.

1094
01:40:17,851 --> 01:40:19,144
It's not that cold.

1095
01:40:20,729 --> 01:40:22,814
Don't be a girl.
Leave that to Michael.

1096
01:40:22,940 --> 01:40:24,650
You two are like a bad car wreck.

1097
01:40:24,733 --> 01:40:27,027
I wash my hands
of the both of you!

1098
01:40:27,027 --> 01:40:28,946
It's cold!

1099
01:40:29,947 --> 01:40:31,448
Quit splashing!

1100
01:41:05,816 --> 01:41:08,151
For the want of a nail

1101
01:41:08,235 --> 01:41:09,736
The world was lost

1102
01:41:09,736 --> 01:41:12,030
For the want of a nail

1103
01:41:12,114 --> 01:41:14,449
The world was lost

1104
01:41:14,533 --> 01:41:18,120
The want of a nail

1105
01:41:18,328 --> 01:41:21,748
The want of a nail

1106
01:41:21,832 --> 01:41:26,044
For the want of a nail,
the shoe was lost

1107
01:41:26,253 --> 01:41:29,715
For the want of a shoe,
the horse was lost

1108
01:41:29,840 --> 01:41:33,927
For the want of a horse,
the rider was lost

1109
01:41:34,052 --> 01:41:38,015
For the want of a rider,
the message was lost

1110
01:41:38,140 --> 01:41:42,144
For the want of a nail,
the world was lost

1111
01:41:42,227 --> 01:41:46,315
For the want of a nail,
the world was lost

1112
01:41:46,440 --> 01:41:50,652
The want of a nail

1113
01:41:50,819 --> 01:41:53,822
The want of a nail

1114
01:41:53,947 --> 01:41:58,327
For the want of a rider,
the message was lost

1115
01:41:58,452 --> 01:42:01,830
For the want of a message,
the battle was lost

1116
01:42:01,830 --> 01:42:06,126
For the want of a battle,
the war was lost

1117
01:42:06,126 --> 01:42:10,547
For the want of a war,
the kingdom was lost

1118
01:42:10,631 --> 01:42:14,051
The want of a nail,
the world was lost

1119
01:42:14,051 --> 01:42:17,137
The want of a nail

1120
01:42:17,221 --> 01:42:21,350
I've been wrong

1121
01:42:21,433 --> 01:42:25,938
I had plans so big

1122
01:42:26,021 --> 01:42:30,234
But the devil's in the details

1123
01:42:30,234 --> 01:42:33,737
I left out one thing

1124
01:42:33,820 --> 01:42:35,447
No one to love me

1125
01:42:35,614 --> 01:42:37,449
No one to love me

1126
01:42:45,332 --> 01:42:46,917
And no one to love

1127
01:42:54,633 --> 01:42:58,053
What's all this talk
about horses and war?

1128
01:42:58,053 --> 01:43:02,349
Put yourself in the place
of the man at the forge

1129
01:43:02,349 --> 01:43:05,936
And day after day
you live a life without love

1130
01:43:06,019 --> 01:43:08,647
Till the morning
you can't take it anymore

1131
01:43:08,730 --> 01:43:10,023
And you don't get up

1132
01:43:10,023 --> 01:43:12,025
Multiply it a billion times

1133
01:43:12,150 --> 01:43:14,319
Spread it all around the world

1134
01:43:14,319 --> 01:43:18,448
Put the curse of loneliness
on every boy and every girl

1135
01:43:18,532 --> 01:43:20,534
Until everybody's kickin',
everybody's scratchin'

1136
01:43:20,617 --> 01:43:22,244
Everything seems to fail

1137
01:43:22,327 --> 01:43:24,246
And it was all

1138
01:43:24,246 --> 01:43:26,123
All

1139
01:43:26,248 --> 01:43:30,127
For the want of a nail

1140
01:43:30,335 --> 01:43:31,628
The want of a nail

1141
01:43:31,753 --> 01:43:34,214
Tell me, what else
could the answer be?

1142
01:43:34,339 --> 01:43:38,552
The want of a nail,
not one thing

1143
01:43:38,552 --> 01:43:41,138
The want of a nail

1144
01:43:45,017 --> 01:43:48,228
Want of a nail,
the world was lost...

1145
01:45:42,050 --> 01:45:43,343
Action.

1146
01:45:48,849 --> 01:45:50,851
What a dump.

1147
01:45:50,851 --> 01:45:55,647
Hey, where's that from?
"What a dump."

1148
01:45:58,233 --> 01:46:00,152
How would I know, Martha?

1149
01:49:36,451 --> 01:49:39,746
So you weht to this camp.
What was that like?

1150
01:49:39,746 --> 01:49:42,457
I was consistently miscast...

1151
01:49:42,541 --> 01:49:47,254
Titus Andronicus,
Stanley Kowalski.

1152
01:49:47,337 --> 01:49:50,632
Then there was the year they
couldn't find a girl to cast as Annie,

1153
01:49:50,757 --> 01:49:52,551
so I played "Andy."

1154
01:49:53,551 --> 01:50:03,551
