00:03:10,698 --> 00:03:12,757
Many centuries ago...

2
00:03:12,967 --> 00:03:15,401
...a remarkable family
began to practice...

3
00:03:15,603 --> 00:03:18,401
...the magical art of disguise.

4
00:03:18,606 --> 00:03:22,007
Down through the ages
they worked in secret...

5
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:25,303
...protecting the world from evil.

6
00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:28,275
This is their story.

7
00:03:46,367 --> 00:03:48,028
WeII, stop her!

8
00:03:52,873 --> 00:03:54,841
This is my son.

9
00:03:56,243 --> 00:03:59,644
Most people thought he sold
vacuum cleaners door to door.

10
00:03:59,847 --> 00:04:03,476
But as you can see,
there was more to the story.

11
00:04:03,818 --> 00:04:06,548
Where do you think you're going?

12
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,665
Idiot.

13
00:04:30,644 --> 00:04:33,477
This is a mistake.
That woman is not Bo Derek!

14
00:04:34,648 --> 00:04:36,775
That was cIose.

15
00:04:45,393 --> 00:04:47,190
Too cIose.

16
00:04:47,895 --> 00:04:51,592
I demand to speak
to the American Embassy!

17
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,593
Frabbrizio, it's time your son
is toId of his destiny.

18
00:04:56,804 --> 00:04:59,568
This is no Iife for my son.

19
00:04:59,807 --> 00:05:03,675
I wiII never teII him
of his true destiny.

20
00:05:14,755 --> 00:05:19,249
Frabbrizio decided to keep the family
legacy a secret from his son.

21
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:23,726
The boy never knew the truth
about his urge to disguise himself...

22
00:05:23,931 --> 00:05:26,729
...with anything he could find.

23
00:05:26,901 --> 00:05:29,631
Pistachio, I hope
you're not making faces...

24
00:05:29,837 --> 00:05:32,897
...in the mirror with the underwear
on the head.

25
00:05:33,107 --> 00:05:35,337
That wouId be crazy, Papa.

26
00:05:36,143 --> 00:05:40,546
UnIess I had the shaving-cream beard
to go aIong with it.

27
00:05:40,748 --> 00:05:46,448
This is my grandson Pistachio.
He has always been a little different.

28
00:05:49,657 --> 00:05:53,423
From the beginning,
he had impulses he couldn't control.

29
00:05:53,627 --> 00:05:55,857
You sIap me, I sIap you.

30
00:05:56,130 --> 00:06:00,430
As Pistachio grew up, he couldn't help
mimicking people around him.

31
00:06:00,634 --> 00:06:03,933
Add the copper suIfate.

32
00:06:04,138 --> 00:06:06,436
Add the copper suIfate.

33
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:11,236
Add just a IittIe bit of IuminoI.

34
00:06:11,445 --> 00:06:14,744
Add just a IittIe bit of IuminoI.

35
00:06:21,188 --> 00:06:25,386
But he always had
a hard time fitting in.

36
00:06:26,494 --> 00:06:29,486
You think you got muscIes now?
Try this.

37
00:06:29,663 --> 00:06:30,789
Okay.

38
00:06:34,635 --> 00:06:37,297
Why does he have underwear
on his head?

39
00:06:37,471 --> 00:06:42,408
What he didn't know was that
his true adventure was about to begin.

40
00:06:43,944 --> 00:06:47,038
There's a young Iady out here
to see you.

41
00:06:47,214 --> 00:06:49,910
For me? Fantastico!

42
00:06:50,117 --> 00:06:51,846
Yes! Yes!

43
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,688
A young Iady.

44
00:06:56,023 --> 00:06:57,650
Hey, amico!

45
00:06:58,025 --> 00:07:00,425
There's a girI waiting for me!

46
00:07:01,061 --> 00:07:02,653
Mama!

47
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:09,235
Ask your nice Iady friend to come in,
and I'II make you corned beef ravioIi.

48
00:07:09,436 --> 00:07:11,870
What a grand idea, Mama!

49
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:16,467
Oh, my sonny-son, handsome son.
Go, go, go.

50
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,447
Naturally, Pistachio wanted
to find a girljust like Mama.

51
00:07:31,058 --> 00:07:34,994
Sophia. What an unexpected
surprise, Iove-cake.

52
00:07:35,529 --> 00:07:39,556
-''Love-cake''?
-I so enjoyed meeting you Iast evening.

53
00:07:39,767 --> 00:07:44,761
I know we had some Iaughs at the bar
Iast night, but you're not my type.

54
00:07:45,005 --> 00:07:49,465
Besides, I have a boyfriend.
So don't caII me, okay? I gotta go.

55
00:07:50,911 --> 00:07:52,276
Yes.

56
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:56,477
Something about her
reminds me of my mama.

57
00:07:57,785 --> 00:08:00,754
Oh, yes. She wiII be a great cook.

58
00:08:01,755 --> 00:08:03,222
Papa.

59
00:08:06,627 --> 00:08:08,492
I straighten the menu.

60
00:08:17,638 --> 00:08:19,071
I'm okay. I'm okay.

61
00:08:20,441 --> 00:08:21,601
Excuse, young man.

62
00:08:21,809 --> 00:08:26,542
I notice that you became acquainted
with the sidewaIk a moment ago.

63
00:08:26,747 --> 00:08:28,305
I'm not a sports kid.

64
00:08:28,515 --> 00:08:32,417
Pistachio, do one of your funny voices
and cheer the kid up.

65
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:36,056
What an exceIIent idea, Bernardo.
Yes, yes.

66
00:08:36,257 --> 00:08:40,250
I do for you now a scene
from the hit motion picture Shrek.

67
00:08:40,461 --> 00:08:41,792
You ready? Okay.

68
00:08:42,329 --> 00:08:45,389
Why don't you get away
from me, Donkey?

69
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:50,936
What you taIking about, ''Get away
from you''? I'm making waffIes.

70
00:08:55,542 --> 00:08:57,737
Oh, what a cute IittIe puppy.

71
00:08:58,445 --> 00:09:02,905
I see you Iike my dog.
His name is The Cuteness.

72
00:09:03,117 --> 00:09:04,414
I never had a dog.

73
00:09:04,618 --> 00:09:07,678
WeII, perhaps your papa
wiII buy you a dog.

74
00:09:08,155 --> 00:09:09,679
I never had a dad.

75
00:09:13,327 --> 00:09:15,192
Papa deficient, yes.

76
00:09:15,629 --> 00:09:19,190
You can pIay with The Cuteness
any time you want.

77
00:09:21,201 --> 00:09:24,864
Let me introduce myseIf.
My name's Pistachio Disguisey.

78
00:09:25,072 --> 00:09:28,439
-My name's Barney Baker.
-A pIeasure, Barney Baker.

79
00:09:29,143 --> 00:09:31,703
And now, hungry patrons.

80
00:09:31,945 --> 00:09:33,310
Arrivederci!

81
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:56,329
Moron, use a tray next time.
Those are too many pIates.

82
00:09:56,537 --> 00:09:59,028
Ah, the new waiter, Rex.

83
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:01,998
So cute in your inexperience.

84
00:10:02,209 --> 00:10:05,610
Watch and Iearn, my friend.

85
00:10:16,056 --> 00:10:18,889
Yes, I cIean. I cIean.

86
00:10:19,927 --> 00:10:22,122
Goodbye, gooey sauce.

87
00:10:26,133 --> 00:10:31,036
Cheese? Yes, I give you cheese.
Yes, nice cheese. Yes, cheese.

88
00:10:31,238 --> 00:10:33,229
You Iike, huh? Oh, yes.

89
00:10:36,343 --> 00:10:38,004
Papa.

90
00:10:40,147 --> 00:10:43,844
And finaIIy, we have fresh,
bouncing baby shrimp.

91
00:10:44,051 --> 00:10:46,519
I'II just take the spaghetti.

92
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:52,158
And do me a favor, buddy.
Get me some man-sized meatbaIIs.

93
00:10:56,296 --> 00:11:00,596
Am I going too fast for you?

94
00:11:01,969 --> 00:11:06,167
Am I going too fast for you?

95
00:11:07,474 --> 00:11:09,669
-You mocking him?
-You mocking him?

96
00:11:09,843 --> 00:11:12,903
-You better not be.
-You better not be.

97
00:11:14,581 --> 00:11:19,541
-Pistachio, stop it. No mocking.
-Pistachio, stop it. No mocking.

98
00:11:19,753 --> 00:11:23,450
Why do you Iet
that IittIe nutbaII be a waiter?

99
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:28,389
Listen. You have a probIem with my son,
then you have a probIem with me.

100
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:33,465
You are not weIcome here.
You, and you, get out!

101
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:37,002
Pistachio, what did I teII you?

102
00:11:37,204 --> 00:11:41,106
Yes, I know, Papa. I'm sorry.
I couIdn't heIp myseIf.

103
00:11:41,275 --> 00:11:44,073
-The mocking's getting worse.
-Nonsense.

104
00:11:44,244 --> 00:11:48,010
There's so many voices in my head
I don't know who I am.

105
00:11:48,215 --> 00:11:52,481
Listen. You are Pistachio Disguisey,
and you're a great waiter.

106
00:11:52,653 --> 00:11:55,781
That is one of the voices.
Not the Ioudest one--

107
00:11:55,956 --> 00:11:59,517
No. You are my son, you understand?

108
00:11:59,726 --> 00:12:04,595
And I wiII aIways be proud of you.

109
00:12:04,798 --> 00:12:09,497
-We shouId have gone to Burger King.
-Perhaps my destiny is far away.

110
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:13,936
No, my son.
Your destiny is here, okay?

111
00:12:14,107 --> 00:12:16,337
Yes, destiny is here.

112
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:21,345
But, Papa, don't preach. I'm in
troubIe deep, and I'm keeping my baby.

113
00:12:23,317 --> 00:12:25,251
-You're what?
-What?

114
00:12:35,262 --> 00:12:39,995
Excuse, waiter Rex. What are you doing
with your arm around the cake?

115
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:44,728
The tush queen, what are you doing
out here with the oversized Rex?

116
00:12:44,905 --> 00:12:48,397
Look, Pistachios, the siIIy voices,
the making faces...

117
00:12:48,575 --> 00:12:51,840
-...it was fun for one second, okay?
-OnIy one second?

118
00:12:52,012 --> 00:12:55,573
I never wanted to go out with youse!
I Iove Rex.

119
00:12:55,849 --> 00:12:58,044
Yeah, got it?

120
00:13:00,087 --> 00:13:02,783
I see. I can take a hint.

121
00:13:03,156 --> 00:13:07,820
The message is coming through
Ioud and cIear.

122
00:13:08,362 --> 00:13:11,593
-I gotta get back to work, baby.
-Okay.

123
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:13,891
Goodbye, Pistachios.

124
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,412
Get in the car, huh?

125
00:13:30,417 --> 00:13:35,320
Oh, my IittIe cannoIi.
You'II make my Pistachio very happy.

126
00:13:36,456 --> 00:13:39,254
Get in the car now!
Get him in there!

127
00:13:42,262 --> 00:13:43,593
Let's go!

128
00:13:48,936 --> 00:13:50,198
Ransacked!

129
00:13:50,404 --> 00:13:54,204
HeIIo? PoIice? In my home,
it is fuII of ransackery.

130
00:13:54,408 --> 00:13:56,433
Everything different. Where--?

131
00:13:56,643 --> 00:13:59,578
My name is Pistachio.
Mama's cannoIi is here.

132
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,941
Don't call again.

133
00:14:02,649 --> 00:14:04,139
Mama! Papa!

134
00:14:04,451 --> 00:14:08,820
HeavenIy Father, show me a sign.
I promise I'II never mock you again.

135
00:14:08,989 --> 00:14:12,447
My famiIy is missing,
and I don't know what to do.

136
00:14:12,626 --> 00:14:18,656
I don't know what to do. I don't know
what to do. I don't know....

137
00:14:40,787 --> 00:14:42,482
Can I heIp you?

138
00:14:42,656 --> 00:14:45,955
-I came to heIp you, Pistachio.
-HeIp me what?

139
00:14:46,126 --> 00:14:49,186
Find your mother
and your father. My son.

140
00:14:49,696 --> 00:14:51,186
My father...

141
00:14:51,398 --> 00:14:53,332
...your son.

142
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,991
HoIy cannoIi, you are my sister.

143
00:14:57,804 --> 00:15:01,934
You don't have a sister, pea brain.
I'm your grandfather.

144
00:15:02,142 --> 00:15:04,133
Yes, that was my next choice.

145
00:15:04,311 --> 00:15:07,405
It's been 23 years.
How did you know I needed heIp?

146
00:15:07,648 --> 00:15:14,110
That and more wiII be reveaIed shortIy.
But for now, Iet me in. I hunger.

147
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:18,057
So I come down from the rooftop.
I come home.

148
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:22,489
And there's no Mama, no Papa,
just ransackery.

149
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:25,830
-Did you ask Jeeves?
-Yes, but no such Iuck.

150
00:15:25,999 --> 00:15:30,436
On the roof, did you hear something
that sounded Iike this:

151
00:15:31,338 --> 00:15:33,806
Yes, exactIy that!

152
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:37,034
But without the pain on my face.

153
00:15:37,244 --> 00:15:39,508
We have a cIue!

154
00:15:46,386 --> 00:15:48,354
Grandpapa?

155
00:15:50,857 --> 00:15:55,226
-I'm Iooking for my grandfather.
-Grandfather not here.

156
00:15:56,263 --> 00:15:57,594
I'm sorry.

157
00:15:58,598 --> 00:16:00,361
It's me, you idiot!

158
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:03,534
Amazing. You sound Iike Grandfather.

159
00:16:03,737 --> 00:16:06,968
FooI! I am your grandfather.

160
00:16:08,608 --> 00:16:10,098
I don't....

161
00:16:15,415 --> 00:16:17,576
Latex rubber.

162
00:16:17,784 --> 00:16:20,344
Yes. It's so soft.

163
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:24,354
Like a soft, fat baby-bottom face.

164
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:27,282
This is nothing. I'm rusty!

165
00:16:27,494 --> 00:16:32,522
When I'm on the top of my game,
my disguise is seamIess!

166
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:35,699
Yes, without the seams.

167
00:16:36,937 --> 00:16:40,304
And the pIace is so incredibIy cIean.

168
00:16:40,507 --> 00:16:42,407
So tidy.

169
00:16:42,809 --> 00:16:45,107
Bravo, Grandpa!

170
00:16:45,812 --> 00:16:50,442
Put a cIamp on your pastry hoIe.
I'II give it to you straight.

171
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:55,078
-You are a Disguisey.
-Yes, Pistachio Disguisey.

172
00:16:55,288 --> 00:16:58,587
I'm begging you,
curb your yammering skuII cave!

173
00:16:58,759 --> 00:17:01,227
Now, throughout history...

174
00:17:01,394 --> 00:17:05,262
...the Disguiseys used their skiIIs
as Masters of Disguise...

175
00:17:05,432 --> 00:17:08,299
...for the betterment of mankind.

176
00:17:08,468 --> 00:17:12,461
In Europe, they used their power
to catch thieves.

177
00:17:12,639 --> 00:17:15,802
Now I've got it. It's mine.

178
00:17:15,976 --> 00:17:17,967
The statue is aIive!

179
00:17:18,445 --> 00:17:21,346
They were the world's
first environmentalists.

180
00:17:21,548 --> 00:17:25,746
Sorry, George Washington,
no cherry tree for you.

181
00:17:27,821 --> 00:17:30,654
Abraham Lincoln
was such a boring speaker...

182
00:17:30,991 --> 00:17:35,758
...that the Disguiseys had to help him
get elected president.

183
00:17:36,696 --> 00:17:40,860
If you'II excuse me,
I just need a drink of water.

184
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:42,762
Rough crowd.

185
00:17:44,504 --> 00:17:48,201
Let's party! Hit it, boys!

186
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:54,273
Vote for me,
we'II get funky this year!

187
00:17:58,785 --> 00:18:01,151
This is your Iegacy, Pistachio.

188
00:18:01,321 --> 00:18:05,155
These are your peopIe,
and you are one of them.

189
00:18:05,325 --> 00:18:07,225
But Papa runs a restaurant.

190
00:18:07,394 --> 00:18:11,057
Your father was the worId's
greatest Master of Disguise.

191
00:18:11,231 --> 00:18:13,131
But Papa runs a restaurant.

192
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:18,465
This is what you are doing. This is
what I want you to do. Any questions?

193
00:18:19,406 --> 00:18:22,000
Your parents, despite my objections...

194
00:18:22,175 --> 00:18:25,076
...insisted on keeping
the Iegacy a secret.

195
00:18:25,245 --> 00:18:29,113
-That's why we haven't spoken in years.
-But my papa--

196
00:18:33,887 --> 00:18:37,379
It is time for you
to find your father and mother.

197
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:41,859
You mean, we wiII find
my father and my mother.

198
00:18:42,062 --> 00:18:44,758
-ImpossibIe. Sorry.
-But why?

199
00:18:44,931 --> 00:18:49,391
This is the sacred book
of the Disguisey way.

200
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:52,237
Like a Boy Scout handbook?

201
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:57,442
You cannot compare this book
to anything eIse known to man.

202
00:19:02,148 --> 00:19:03,945
It's a pop-up!

203
00:19:05,952 --> 00:19:08,182
''If a father and mother are missing...

204
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:13,019
...onIy a son who has become
a Master of Disguise can save them...

205
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:17,687
...without any direct heIp
from the grandfather.''

206
00:19:17,864 --> 00:19:20,560
That's one specific farmer.

207
00:19:20,767 --> 00:19:25,431
-Now I must find your father's nest.
-Come again? A ''nest''?

208
00:19:25,672 --> 00:19:29,403
Is there a pIace your father goes
to spend time by himseIf...

209
00:19:29,576 --> 00:19:34,479
-...that is dark, that is secretive?
-The attic is dark and secretive.

210
00:19:34,981 --> 00:19:38,246
Show me this attic.

211
00:19:38,718 --> 00:19:40,447
So, Grandpa...

212
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,679
...this is the attic.

213
00:19:42,889 --> 00:19:46,985
This is a pretty ordinary attic.
There's nothing--

214
00:19:51,197 --> 00:19:53,290
What? What? What? What?

215
00:19:54,768 --> 00:19:57,601
A magic baII.

216
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:42,548
BehoId your father's nest.

217
00:20:42,749 --> 00:20:44,307
Heavens to Betsy.

218
00:20:44,484 --> 00:20:48,443
Yes. I knew he wouId keep one,
just in case.

219
00:20:48,621 --> 00:20:49,952
Yes. Just in case.

220
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:52,455
Now you'II be a Master of Disguise.

221
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:55,458
ReaIIy?
A Master of Disguise?

222
00:20:55,628 --> 00:21:00,065
I'm going to be a Master of Disguise
I'm going to be a Master of Disguise

223
00:21:00,233 --> 00:21:04,465
Enough! Your mother and father
are in grave danger.

224
00:21:04,637 --> 00:21:07,902
Your training begins...

225
00:21:08,074 --> 00:21:10,474
...now!

226
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:37,334
BriIIiant.
You are disguised as a fatty.

227
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:44,073
What is happening?

228
00:21:44,377 --> 00:21:45,901
I'm getting bigger.

229
00:21:46,546 --> 00:21:48,844
-I got so fat.
-Pistachio!

230
00:22:25,785 --> 00:22:27,218
Remember me?

231
00:22:29,656 --> 00:22:31,453
DevIin Bowman?

232
00:22:32,592 --> 00:22:36,392
We both know you were the woman,
that night in PaIermo.

233
00:22:36,896 --> 00:22:41,094
Because of you,
I spent 20 years in prison.

234
00:22:45,472 --> 00:22:48,066
Thanks to a potion
in the carameI corn...

235
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:52,837
...she thinks she's stiII at home
preparing dinner. But we know better.

236
00:22:53,012 --> 00:22:54,741
Don't we?

237
00:22:55,748 --> 00:22:58,080
Oh, my goodness!

238
00:22:58,952 --> 00:23:00,317
Okay, okay. Stop.

239
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:05,917
We'II have soup today.

240
00:23:06,126 --> 00:23:10,586
You're right.
I was Bo Derek that night in PaIermo.

241
00:23:10,797 --> 00:23:14,324
-What do you want?
-I want you to drop your pizza apron...

242
00:23:14,501 --> 00:23:16,867
...become a Master of Disguise again...

243
00:23:17,036 --> 00:23:21,405
...and heIp me obtain
the worId's rarest treasures.

244
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:24,668
You're a sick man, Bowman.

245
00:23:36,022 --> 00:23:38,047
-Are the teeth in?
-Yes.

246
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:40,350
Good. Here, and here.

247
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:44,326
There's minimaI adhesive spiIIage.
That's not bad.

248
00:23:44,531 --> 00:23:48,558
Good. Now aII I have to do
is disguise my voice, right?

249
00:23:48,735 --> 00:23:52,535
Open sesame. Open sesame.

250
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,505
Stop that!

251
00:23:55,875 --> 00:24:02,041
Buffoon! CIown! Anyone can put
on a disguise and change his voice.

252
00:24:02,215 --> 00:24:05,878
But you said that was the secret power
of the Disguiseys.

253
00:24:06,252 --> 00:24:11,349
Not exactIy. It's time for you to Iearn
about the invisibIe energy fieId...

254
00:24:11,524 --> 00:24:14,823
...that bonds aII Disguiseys,
past and present.

255
00:24:15,061 --> 00:24:16,653
It is caIIed:

256
00:24:16,996 --> 00:24:21,023
-Energico.
-Energico.

257
00:24:21,201 --> 00:24:26,764
When you Iearn to tap into Energico,
you'II access words, skiIIs, ideas...

258
00:24:26,973 --> 00:24:30,067
...that you never dreamed possibIe.

259
00:24:30,243 --> 00:24:33,735
You'II be abIe to act
and feeI Iike another person.

260
00:24:33,913 --> 00:24:35,710
You wiII become...

261
00:24:35,882 --> 00:24:38,578
...another person.

262
00:24:39,252 --> 00:24:41,584
Become another person.

263
00:24:41,921 --> 00:24:45,254
But first, you must repeat the mantra:

264
00:24:45,425 --> 00:24:48,986
Become another person.

265
00:24:49,195 --> 00:24:52,255
-''Become another person.'' Nothing.
-Again.

266
00:24:52,432 --> 00:24:54,423
-Become another person.
-Repeat.

267
00:24:54,601 --> 00:24:57,468
Become another person.
Become another person.

268
00:24:57,637 --> 00:25:00,868
Become another person.

269
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,600
Good. Who are you now?

270
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:05,778
The question is, who are you?

271
00:25:05,945 --> 00:25:09,278
I'm Prince LaIi Jhamba
from the Ringy Dingy Heights...

272
00:25:09,449 --> 00:25:13,510
...near Bombay, CaIcutta
and New DeIhi, India. India. India.

273
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:17,019
It is time to test that.

274
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:19,582
What is it?

275
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,788
That is a big reptiIe.
Not a probIem.

276
00:25:35,942 --> 00:25:40,311
Oh, yes.
He wouIdn't hurt anybody now.

277
00:25:40,546 --> 00:25:43,413
I'm going to caII him Buttercup.

278
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,642
So cute, eh?

279
00:25:47,654 --> 00:25:50,782
TickIe-tickIe-tickIe-tickIe.

280
00:25:51,324 --> 00:25:53,656
Energico.

281
00:25:53,826 --> 00:25:55,453
God heIp me, I Iove it.

282
00:25:56,863 --> 00:25:59,661
-Down, boy.
-A compIete transformation.

283
00:26:01,634 --> 00:26:06,162
You Iike the cheese. Go get
the cheese. You know you Iove it.

284
00:26:07,206 --> 00:26:12,508
Now, sometimes during your traveIs,
you may be required to defend yourseIf.

285
00:26:12,679 --> 00:26:16,376
Disguiseys don't beIieve in hitting
with a cIosed fist.

286
00:26:16,582 --> 00:26:18,846
AIways hit with an open hand.

287
00:26:19,018 --> 00:26:22,112
Make your point,
but give the man his dignity.

288
00:26:22,288 --> 00:26:24,347
-Dignity.
-Observe.

289
00:26:29,696 --> 00:26:32,563
EIbows in, extend.

290
00:26:32,732 --> 00:26:36,498
-Now you try.
-EIbow in, extend.

291
00:26:38,471 --> 00:26:40,371
Okay, sIappy-dummy man.

292
00:26:41,741 --> 00:26:44,642
WeII, I think I've got--

293
00:26:45,178 --> 00:26:46,372
Pistachio, no.

294
00:26:46,546 --> 00:26:50,880
Learn to empty your mind.
AIIow Energico to fIow through you.

295
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:56,545
-Is there a mantra for the hitting?
-No! But to demoraIize your opponent...

296
00:26:56,723 --> 00:27:00,557
...repeat the phrase,
''Who's your daddy?'' in mid-sIap.

297
00:27:00,727 --> 00:27:02,490
Watch.

298
00:27:02,762 --> 00:27:06,528
Who's your daddy? Who's your daddy?
Who's your daddy?

299
00:27:11,771 --> 00:27:14,399
Thanks for Ietting me
borrow the Constitution.

300
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,905
You're MichaeI Johnson,
the fastest man aIive.

301
00:27:18,077 --> 00:27:21,376
-You ready?
-Yes, sir, Mr. Johnson.

302
00:27:22,181 --> 00:27:23,910
Go!

303
00:27:28,187 --> 00:27:29,916
Thanks, guys!

304
00:27:30,189 --> 00:27:33,181
You shouId read this, Bowman.

305
00:27:34,026 --> 00:27:36,051
You might Iearn something.

306
00:27:36,229 --> 00:27:39,926
I Iove having a Master of Disguise
do my bidding.

307
00:27:40,099 --> 00:27:42,067
That's it.

308
00:27:42,602 --> 00:27:44,866
Have you forgotten something?

309
00:27:45,104 --> 00:27:48,562
My men are ready to pounce
on my command.

310
00:27:48,741 --> 00:27:51,767
-No more. PIease, stop.
-AII right, aII right.

311
00:28:18,771 --> 00:28:21,399
Okay, so you want to pIay games?

312
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:23,303
Let's pIay games.

313
00:28:26,612 --> 00:28:29,080
Who is your daddy?

314
00:28:29,282 --> 00:28:32,308
I'm your daddy. I'm your daddy.
I'm your daddy....

315
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:49,629
She couId be a good wife for you.

316
00:28:54,841 --> 00:28:57,810
WeII, am I truIy
a Master of Disguise now?

317
00:28:58,377 --> 00:29:02,040
Not exactIy. You're a IeveI-one
apprentice. White beIt.

318
00:29:02,248 --> 00:29:06,014
Yes! ''LeveI one.''
I Iike the sound of that one.

319
00:29:06,185 --> 00:29:09,643
-How many IeveIs are there?
-Seven thousand.

320
00:29:10,189 --> 00:29:15,650
-That's many coIored beIts.
-Yes, you're a rookie.

321
00:29:16,362 --> 00:29:19,195
Listen. It is a Disguisey tradition...

322
00:29:19,398 --> 00:29:22,834
...at this point in time,
we hire you an assistant.

323
00:29:23,035 --> 00:29:26,698
An assistant?
Yes, I am going to get an assistant.

324
00:29:26,873 --> 00:29:31,173
-I was secretary for Jensen and Loeb--
-Get out!

325
00:29:31,344 --> 00:29:33,869
-I beg your pardon?
-Out! Now!

326
00:29:36,182 --> 00:29:37,547
Get out.

327
00:29:38,017 --> 00:29:39,484
What are you doing here?

328
00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:40,676
History!

329
00:29:40,887 --> 00:29:42,286
Wrong! Take her away.

330
00:29:42,488 --> 00:29:45,013
Get out. Idiot! Get out!

331
00:29:45,925 --> 00:29:47,085
Freak. Get out!

332
00:29:47,326 --> 00:29:50,090
Freak. Get out!
Freak. Out! Out!

333
00:29:50,396 --> 00:29:52,523
Fifty appIicants.

334
00:29:52,698 --> 00:29:55,792
-Fifty Iosers.
-Yes.

335
00:29:56,536 --> 00:30:02,065
Perhaps my destiny does not come
with an assistant.

336
00:30:03,609 --> 00:30:06,339
I'm okay. I'm okay.

337
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:11,579
You too young for this job. Go home
and change your diaper. Get out!

338
00:30:11,751 --> 00:30:13,241
I don't wear a diaper.

339
00:30:13,452 --> 00:30:17,047
Pistachio. Come see.
There's a taIking baby here.

340
00:30:17,223 --> 00:30:20,681
I want to see the taIking baby.

341
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:23,192
Brave Barney, good to see you.

342
00:30:23,396 --> 00:30:25,523
-You know this baby?
-Of course.

343
00:30:25,731 --> 00:30:29,030
-I was potty trained when I was 2.
-Of course.

344
00:30:29,201 --> 00:30:32,693
You are the conductor
of the potty train.

345
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:35,636
Barney. Is this the pIace?

346
00:30:35,841 --> 00:30:38,935
I just came from a yoga cIass.
I hope that's okay.

347
00:30:39,111 --> 00:30:41,773
Grandpa, this is Barney and....

348
00:30:41,948 --> 00:30:45,611
-I'm his mom, Jennifer. Hi.
-Jennifer. A pIeasure, yes.

349
00:30:47,153 --> 00:30:51,715
Sweetie, go practice your oIIies,
and I'II see you Iater, okay?

350
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:53,791
PIease, come in.

351
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:58,591
-Measurements.
-Measurements? What for?

352
00:30:58,798 --> 00:31:01,767
-It's for a uniform.
-Oh, yeah. Okay.

353
00:31:02,001 --> 00:31:04,799
It's 35-24-34.

354
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:09,306
-You said 34?
-A IittIe bottom.

355
00:31:13,012 --> 00:31:17,676
I don't know if I'm right for this.
Barney said you were Iooking....

356
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:22,411
I'm sorry, he's onIy 7.
He thinks your name is Pistachio.

357
00:31:22,622 --> 00:31:25,113
That is my name.

358
00:31:25,291 --> 00:31:26,758
WeII, that's nice.

359
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:31,658
So okay. What is the job?
What exactIy do you guys do?

360
00:31:31,831 --> 00:31:35,858
I am a Master of Disguise.
He is aIso a Master of Disguise.

361
00:31:36,035 --> 00:31:39,027
TechnicaIIy,
he's a IeveI-one apprentice.

362
00:31:39,271 --> 00:31:41,967
''Master of Disguise''? I don't get it.

363
00:31:42,341 --> 00:31:46,175
You got a probIem with the word
''master,'' or ''disguise''?

364
00:31:46,345 --> 00:31:49,337
Or the word ''of''?

365
00:31:49,515 --> 00:31:52,006
WeII, what wouId I have to do?

366
00:31:52,184 --> 00:31:54,118
What does she have to do?

367
00:31:54,286 --> 00:31:59,189
Not so fast. Answer me this first:
Do you foId easiIy under pressure?

368
00:31:59,358 --> 00:32:01,292
What kind of pressure?

369
00:32:01,527 --> 00:32:05,554
-The kind that makes you cry.
-Like a IittIe baby in its crib.

370
00:32:05,731 --> 00:32:09,462
-What's it pay?
-Pay? Paid in honor, dignity, pride.

371
00:32:09,635 --> 00:32:12,729
Honor, dignity, pride...in its crib.

372
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:14,870
ActuaIIy, I need cash.

373
00:32:16,175 --> 00:32:18,973
This cat has cIaws.

374
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:21,204
-Me Iikey.
-Me Iikey too.

375
00:32:21,447 --> 00:32:24,245
But this cat's got no Mama caboose.

376
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:28,011
You guys know I can hear you, right?

377
00:32:47,773 --> 00:32:50,606
It pays $41 7 a week,
pIus DeIta DentaI.

378
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:53,437
-I'II take it.
-It's yours. But hear me.

379
00:32:53,612 --> 00:32:57,104
Assistants faII in Iove
with their Disguisey masters.

380
00:32:57,283 --> 00:33:00,218
Can you resist Pistachio?

381
00:33:00,386 --> 00:33:02,081
Yes...

382
00:33:02,254 --> 00:33:05,052
...can you resist me?

383
00:33:10,529 --> 00:33:13,259
So Iisten to me true, Pistachio.

384
00:33:13,432 --> 00:33:16,697
You are now a IeveI 1 .5 apprentice.

385
00:33:16,902 --> 00:33:20,861
Without your heIp, how wiII I know
what to disguise myseIf as?

386
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:25,602
Listen to your Disguisey instincts.
Answer these questions for yourseIf:

387
00:33:25,778 --> 00:33:29,908
Who, why, where, how wouId they take
your mother and father?

388
00:33:30,116 --> 00:33:32,584
Yes. Who, why, where and why?

389
00:33:32,752 --> 00:33:36,153
No, wrong! Who, why, where and how?

390
00:33:36,322 --> 00:33:39,257
Oh, yes. Who, why, what?

391
00:33:39,425 --> 00:33:44,829
-What and what and what and what?
-What? Wrong! Who, why, where, how?

392
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:49,660
-Yes. Who, why, where, how?
-That's it! You got it!

393
00:33:49,835 --> 00:33:52,167
Yes! Who, why, where, how?

394
00:33:52,338 --> 00:33:55,102
I say, who, why, where, how?

395
00:33:55,274 --> 00:33:57,970
I say, who, why, where, how?

396
00:33:58,144 --> 00:34:01,477
I say, who, why, where, how?

397
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:04,807
Yeah, you, empIoyee.

398
00:34:06,685 --> 00:34:10,348
My grandson is stiII raw.
He's unfocused.

399
00:34:10,589 --> 00:34:14,685
When he becomes another person,
he may be unpredictabIe.

400
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:18,557
About the dentaI,
when Barney and I get stuff done...

401
00:34:18,764 --> 00:34:21,164
...do I pay it,
then you reimburse me?

402
00:34:21,333 --> 00:34:25,667
Or do I biII DeIta DentaI directIy?
I'm not sure how it works.

403
00:34:25,838 --> 00:34:27,635
You sicken me.

404
00:34:29,175 --> 00:34:31,336
I aImost forgot.

405
00:34:32,478 --> 00:34:36,608
-Here is your Nest in a Box.
-''Nest in a Box''?

406
00:34:36,782 --> 00:34:42,846
You may need it. It comes with
instructions. There is something eIse.

407
00:34:45,891 --> 00:34:48,587
The Disguisey BaII of KnowIedge.

408
00:34:48,794 --> 00:34:54,027
When you are in dire straits and don't
know what to do, this wiII be handy.

409
00:34:55,367 --> 00:35:00,964
-I won't Iet you down, master.
-I hope not.

410
00:35:01,707 --> 00:35:05,165
Disguisey thing comes with a Iot
of accoutrements.

411
00:35:05,377 --> 00:35:09,006
-So Iong, master!
-Bye-bye.

412
00:35:09,181 --> 00:35:13,641
AII right, now.
Where to begin our search?

413
00:35:14,019 --> 00:35:18,979
WeII, I guess we couId Iook around
at the spot your father was taken.

414
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:21,388
That's your idea? That's it?

415
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:25,155
To Iook around at the spot
where my father was taken?

416
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:27,162
WeII, that's crazy.

417
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:31,861
So crazy it just might work.

418
00:35:32,938 --> 00:35:35,771
You know, this couId be something.

419
00:35:43,148 --> 00:35:45,912
PIease, assistant,
don't pIay in the trash...

420
00:35:46,085 --> 00:35:48,883
...whiIe I am
in fuII father-finding mode.

421
00:35:49,088 --> 00:35:52,023
I dated a guy who used to smoke these.

422
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:55,718
This cigar's from the TurtIe CIub.
Look at the IabeI.

423
00:35:55,895 --> 00:35:59,262
You want to pIay games?
I'II pIay games with you.

424
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:02,266
There we go.

425
00:36:05,237 --> 00:36:08,104
I dated a guy who used
to smoke these.

426
00:36:08,274 --> 00:36:10,902
This cigar's from the Turtle Club.

427
00:36:12,444 --> 00:36:16,540
Jennifer, do you remember
the thing you once said...

428
00:36:16,715 --> 00:36:20,378
...about the guy you used to date
from the TurtIe CIub?

429
00:36:20,719 --> 00:36:22,084
Yeah.

430
00:36:22,254 --> 00:36:25,587
Yes, my Disguisey instincts
are going crazy.

431
00:36:25,758 --> 00:36:28,625
We shouId pay a visit
to this TurtIe CIub.

432
00:36:28,827 --> 00:36:33,230
It's impossibIe to get in there.
You have to be a member.

433
00:36:33,966 --> 00:36:35,228
You make me Iaugh.

434
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:39,132
We'II see what's impossibIe,
my ever-doubtfuI assistant.

435
00:36:39,305 --> 00:36:41,102
Now, quickIy...

436
00:36:41,273 --> 00:36:43,400
...to the nest!

437
00:36:48,914 --> 00:36:53,851
You know, the name the ''TurtIe CIub,''
it's just a name.

438
00:36:54,019 --> 00:36:57,511
-You're taking it too IiteraIIy.
-TurtIe.

439
00:36:57,756 --> 00:37:00,623
May I heIp you?
You a member of the cIub?

440
00:37:00,793 --> 00:37:02,658
-Not exactIy.
-Not exactIy.

441
00:37:02,861 --> 00:37:06,854
But am I not turtIey enough
for the TurtIe CIub?

442
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:08,756
-Is he okay?
-He's fine.

443
00:37:08,934 --> 00:37:11,494
He's fine. TurtIe.

444
00:37:12,004 --> 00:37:13,471
TurtIe.

445
00:37:13,672 --> 00:37:18,041
He's dreamt of this pIace
ever since he was a chiId.

446
00:37:18,978 --> 00:37:24,382
Do you think we can go in for a moment?
We'II be out in five minutes.

447
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:27,314
-PIease.
-AII right.

448
00:37:35,627 --> 00:37:36,651
TurtIe?

449
00:37:36,829 --> 00:37:38,694
-Not turtIe?
-No.

450
00:37:38,864 --> 00:37:40,661
TurtIe? Not turtIe.

451
00:37:45,371 --> 00:37:49,034
CouId you teII me,
do you recognize this?

452
00:37:49,208 --> 00:37:54,646
I recognize that. I made that cigar
for DevIin Bowman's private coIIection.

453
00:37:56,648 --> 00:38:00,311
-DevIin Bowman.
-TurtIe!

454
00:38:05,224 --> 00:38:06,919
-Is he okay?
-He's fine.

455
00:38:07,092 --> 00:38:10,391
-I'm fine. TurtIe.
-Do you think you can give me...

456
00:38:10,562 --> 00:38:13,998
...an address or phone number
for Mr. Bowman?

457
00:38:14,199 --> 00:38:17,726
Are you crazy?
I can't give you that information.

458
00:38:17,903 --> 00:38:22,272
No information.
What if harm found its way to you?

459
00:38:22,441 --> 00:38:26,400
TerribIe turtIe harm.
WouId that change your mind?

460
00:38:29,214 --> 00:38:33,708
-It's time to go into my sheII.
-No. No, sheII.

461
00:38:33,886 --> 00:38:38,380
-SheII time coming.
-A name is just fine. Thank you much.

462
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:40,023
TurtIe harm.

463
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:45,061
The kind of harm that makes you cry out
in the night Iike a IittIe baby.

464
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:47,721
Hey, baby. Can I buy you a drink?

465
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:50,892
And maybe some pond water
for your friend?

466
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:55,571
Very funny.

467
00:38:58,143 --> 00:39:00,634
-TurtIe!
-Where did he go?

468
00:39:18,564 --> 00:39:22,796
I don't reaIIy know what to say
about what went on back there.

469
00:39:22,968 --> 00:39:26,301
-I know, it was Iike a dream, but reaI.
-I don't--

470
00:39:26,472 --> 00:39:30,772
Tomorrow we wiII find out
just who this DevIin Bowman is.

471
00:39:30,976 --> 00:39:34,275
-This turtIe thing--
-Then we'II find Mama and Papa.

472
00:39:39,184 --> 00:39:41,243
If I'm going to work tomorrow...

473
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:45,151
...I'II need a Iift
because my boyfriend has my car.

474
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:47,119
A boyfriend.

475
00:39:47,292 --> 00:39:48,657
Yes, a boyfriend.

476
00:39:49,461 --> 00:39:52,828
It's getting Iate.
I'm going to go in, okay?

477
00:39:53,031 --> 00:39:55,932
Okay. Good night, my Iove-cake.

478
00:39:56,101 --> 00:39:57,625
-''Love-cake''?
-What?

479
00:39:57,836 --> 00:39:59,997
-You said ''Iove-cake.''
-Why wouId I?

480
00:40:00,172 --> 00:40:02,663
-Your hindquarters are scrawny.
-What?

481
00:40:02,908 --> 00:40:07,504
What I was trying to say is that...

482
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:09,840
...I have a present for Barney.

483
00:40:14,486 --> 00:40:18,115
-Give this to him, from his dad?
-What?

484
00:40:18,524 --> 00:40:22,824
Da-da-da-dat-ItaIian guy. Me.

485
00:40:23,028 --> 00:40:29,490
Oh, okay. This is very sweet of you.
Kneepads. He can use these.

486
00:40:30,335 --> 00:40:32,701
-WeII, thank you.
-Nighty-night.

487
00:40:33,138 --> 00:40:34,400
Good night.

488
00:40:34,573 --> 00:40:37,235
SIeepy time, she comes.

489
00:40:45,884 --> 00:40:49,650
Thanks for the Liberty BeII.
I'II bring it right back.

490
00:40:49,821 --> 00:40:55,657
And remember, that's an action figure,
not a doII.

491
00:40:56,562 --> 00:40:59,087
Sure thing, Governor Ventura. Thanks.

492
00:40:59,531 --> 00:41:02,159
Who'd have thought Governor Ventura...

493
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:07,237
...wouId be the perfect disguise
to abscond with the Liberty BeII?

494
00:41:07,406 --> 00:41:09,340
Me.

495
00:41:09,875 --> 00:41:15,245
My skiIIs were meant for the betterment
of mankind, not for greed and eviI.

496
00:41:15,414 --> 00:41:17,041
PIease.

497
00:41:20,619 --> 00:41:23,611
You shouId see your hair.

498
00:41:23,922 --> 00:41:27,551
You've got serious mask-head.

499
00:41:42,007 --> 00:41:44,373
Pistachio, meet my boyfriend, Trent.

500
00:41:44,543 --> 00:41:48,639
There he is.
Heard a Iot about you, Pistach.

501
00:41:48,814 --> 00:41:51,078
How are you?

502
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:55,113
I forgot my purse. I'II be right back.

503
00:41:56,388 --> 00:41:58,549
Lay off my Iady, you freak.

504
00:41:58,724 --> 00:42:01,716
My, you are a touchy-feeIy guy, Trent.

505
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:07,888
Saved by the uncoordinated
IittIe brat. Hey, Barn.

506
00:42:08,133 --> 00:42:10,465
Grind that curb, buddy. Yeah!

507
00:42:13,272 --> 00:42:14,899
I'm okay. I'm okay.

508
00:42:15,107 --> 00:42:16,267
What a Ioser.

509
00:42:16,441 --> 00:42:21,242
-Thanks for the pads. They heIp.
-You'II Iearn with practice, Barney.

510
00:42:21,446 --> 00:42:23,573
I'II keep trying.

511
00:42:24,182 --> 00:42:27,845
What kind of crap
are you putting in his head?

512
00:42:28,153 --> 00:42:32,146
-Niceness?
-Niceness? What are you, his dad?

513
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:35,424
You trying to horn in on my action?

514
00:42:35,827 --> 00:42:38,921
You trying to horn in on my action?

515
00:42:39,698 --> 00:42:41,859
-What?
-What?

516
00:42:42,301 --> 00:42:45,566
-You mocking me?
-You mocking me?

517
00:42:49,574 --> 00:42:51,132
But I warn you, Trent.

518
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:54,643
My sIap-practice dummy gets
quite a workout IateIy.

519
00:42:54,813 --> 00:42:57,543
You want to fight?
See what awaits you?

520
00:42:57,716 --> 00:42:59,946
First watch the feet. So fast.

521
00:43:00,118 --> 00:43:02,211
Look at my hands. Look at them.

522
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:03,785
Too fast.

523
00:43:16,668 --> 00:43:18,659
Hey, Barn.

524
00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:22,033
Just keep practicing.
You'II just be fine, okay?

525
00:43:22,207 --> 00:43:24,402
I'm ready.

526
00:43:30,215 --> 00:43:33,981
How come I can't do it and you can?

527
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:38,984
Baby, I'II see you
after work, okay? Bye.

528
00:43:43,228 --> 00:43:46,857
He is so good with chiIdren, huh?

529
00:43:50,335 --> 00:43:54,396
I'm never gonna find anything
about this DevIin Bowman guy.

530
00:43:54,573 --> 00:43:56,768
Who's your daddy?

531
00:43:57,376 --> 00:44:00,368
Listen, cIassmate.com thing.

532
00:44:00,579 --> 00:44:02,945
''To be the worId's greatest
bIack marketeer...

533
00:44:03,148 --> 00:44:05,878
...and possess
the rarest treasures on earth...

534
00:44:06,051 --> 00:44:08,713
...then store them
in an underground Iair.''

535
00:44:08,887 --> 00:44:12,687
What? This guy is crazy.
Did you hear this?

536
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:17,295
I can't beIieve he wouId write
something Iike this. Freaky guy.

537
00:44:17,896 --> 00:44:22,356
Yes, we now know the who and the why.

538
00:44:22,534 --> 00:44:28,097
But where do we find a man obsessed
with such a rarity?

539
00:44:28,273 --> 00:44:31,640
WeII, there's this memorabiIia
fair tomorrow...

540
00:44:31,810 --> 00:44:35,109
...with rare toys and stuff.
Maybe he'II be there.

541
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:39,410
So you think that Bowman
wiII show up...

542
00:44:39,584 --> 00:44:43,315
...to see these rare items.

543
00:44:43,822 --> 00:44:47,781
That's crazy. So crazy...

544
00:44:47,959 --> 00:44:52,293
...it just might work.

545
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:58,995
Pistachio and Jennifer went to the
antique show hoping to find Bowman.

546
00:44:59,204 --> 00:45:02,435
My grandson decided
to disguise himself as a lady.

547
00:45:02,641 --> 00:45:03,972
Appraise this!

548
00:45:04,142 --> 00:45:08,010
What are you doing?
That's the Nest in a Box.

549
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:12,910
It appears to be of Tuscan design.
I'd say earIy 1 2th century.

550
00:45:13,084 --> 00:45:15,018
I knew it was oId, you fooI.

551
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:20,351
Let me appraise you: You're an idiot.
A compIete idiot. How does it feeI?

552
00:45:20,525 --> 00:45:23,688
What is this?
1 2th century Tuscan? It's nice.

553
00:45:23,862 --> 00:45:27,696
-I think that's him. That's Bowman.
-Oh!

554
00:45:27,866 --> 00:45:31,859
WeII, you're a taII drink of water.

555
00:45:32,037 --> 00:45:35,666
-And I just Iove moisture.
-What?

556
00:45:35,841 --> 00:45:40,335
AIIow me to introduce myseIf.
My name is Gammy.

557
00:45:40,512 --> 00:45:43,345
-Gammy Num Num.
-DevIin Bowman.

558
00:45:43,748 --> 00:45:46,273
Don't be ashamed of your feeIings.

559
00:45:46,451 --> 00:45:51,548
Your desires are perfectIy normaI,
I assure you.

560
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:55,692
-What desires?
-WeII, guess what, Backstreet Boy?

561
00:45:55,994 --> 00:46:02,456
This GirI Scout isn't content
to be the MaIcoIm in your middIe.

562
00:46:02,667 --> 00:46:05,568
-Run aIong, Gammy. Run aIong.
-Touching me!

563
00:46:05,770 --> 00:46:07,829
Pushing me. There's pressure.

564
00:46:08,006 --> 00:46:10,338
-Moving me back. Touching.
-Go. Go.

565
00:46:10,509 --> 00:46:13,501
-What's your name?
-I'm Barbara.

566
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,407
Nice to meet you, Barbsie.

567
00:46:17,582 --> 00:46:20,813
-We're never going to make babies.
-Right.

568
00:46:20,986 --> 00:46:24,888
I'm having South American art deaIers
to my house on Sunday.

569
00:46:25,090 --> 00:46:27,991
We won't go anywhere
with you, meIonhead.

570
00:46:28,159 --> 00:46:31,720
-I'd Iove it if you'd join us.
-I'd Iove it if you'd shut up.

571
00:46:31,897 --> 00:46:34,161
No need to bring anything...

572
00:46:34,332 --> 00:46:37,699
...except that beautifuI smiIe. Ciao.

573
00:46:37,869 --> 00:46:42,033
''Ciao.'' Did you hear that? ItaIian.
Look out for the ItaIian man.

574
00:46:42,207 --> 00:46:46,200
Fetch! Come on, fetch!

575
00:46:48,947 --> 00:46:53,350
-I'm not comfortabIe with the new pIan.
-It's very easy. Listen.

576
00:46:53,518 --> 00:46:56,419
If you wiII distract Bowman
at the party...

577
00:46:56,588 --> 00:46:58,886
-...I'II disguise myseIf as a--
-No!

578
00:46:59,124 --> 00:47:01,058
I'm Master of Disguise.

579
00:47:01,226 --> 00:47:02,887
-I'm sorry--
-What sorry?

580
00:47:03,061 --> 00:47:07,395
The job description didn't say anything
about dating weird oId guys.

581
00:47:07,566 --> 00:47:09,830
''Dating weird oId guy.''

582
00:47:13,939 --> 00:47:15,600
What? Look.

583
00:47:15,774 --> 00:47:20,234
Look what The Cuteness found.
On page 52...

584
00:47:20,412 --> 00:47:24,473
...the scary monster say,
''From time to time, assistants...

585
00:47:24,649 --> 00:47:28,483
...to IeveI 1 .5 apprentice
Masters of Disguise...

586
00:47:28,653 --> 00:47:33,386
...may be required
to date weird oId guys.''

587
00:47:33,592 --> 00:47:35,253
WeII....

588
00:47:35,594 --> 00:47:36,856
There you have it.

589
00:47:37,729 --> 00:47:39,629
Their plan was simple:

590
00:47:39,798 --> 00:47:43,791
Jennifer would sneak into the mansion
and look for clues...

591
00:47:43,969 --> 00:47:46,597
...while Pistachio
would distract Bowman.

592
00:47:46,771 --> 00:47:49,467
GentIemen, sorry to keep you waiting.

593
00:47:49,641 --> 00:47:52,269
My dear, I'm deIighted you came.

594
00:47:52,477 --> 00:47:55,776
Excuse me,
but where is the Iadies' room?

595
00:47:55,947 --> 00:47:59,678
In the main house, down the haII,
first door on your Ieft.

596
00:47:59,884 --> 00:48:02,614
-Want me to show you?
-No, it's okay.

597
00:48:02,787 --> 00:48:04,687
-Hurry back.
-Okay.

598
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:06,489
Nice.

599
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:12,618
-LoveIy woman.
-WiII you excuse me, pIease?

600
00:48:14,332 --> 00:48:17,301
We'II party aII night Iong.
Right. Having fun.

601
00:48:17,469 --> 00:48:23,465
-Have fun. I must speak to someone--
-Say heIIo to my IittIe friend.

602
00:48:23,642 --> 00:48:26,543
-What is that?
-Don't touch. See that?

603
00:48:26,711 --> 00:48:30,306
That is a rare shrunken head
of a tribaI chieftain...

604
00:48:30,482 --> 00:48:36,443
...from the viIIage
of ConstopoIocoIus HoIihoIibosis....

605
00:48:49,034 --> 00:48:52,060
I'm teIIing you,
Scooby-Doo is computer-generated.

606
00:48:52,237 --> 00:48:55,297
No way! It Iooked so reaI.

607
00:48:55,507 --> 00:48:59,500
I'm very interested in this,
but I have to check on something.

608
00:48:59,678 --> 00:49:01,976
Choking?! HeimIich maneuver.

609
00:49:02,147 --> 00:49:07,881
-I'm not-- I'm not-- I'm not choking!
-Are you choking or not? I gotta know.

610
00:49:08,053 --> 00:49:11,181
-I'm not choking.
-Not choking. My mistake.

611
00:49:11,356 --> 00:49:14,519
He was not choking, and I was doing the
HeimIich maneuver. CouId be dangerous.

612
00:49:14,693 --> 00:49:19,096
I'm sorry. That's my fauIt.
Someone's not choking...

613
00:49:19,264 --> 00:49:20,663
...no maneuver!

614
00:49:21,366 --> 00:49:23,459
No maneuver!

615
00:49:25,837 --> 00:49:30,399
Robin, Ricky, it's him.
I better take these.

616
00:49:30,875 --> 00:49:31,899
Chicken satay?

617
00:49:32,077 --> 00:49:36,537
And get that IittIe stick stuck
in my esophagus? Not a chance.

618
00:49:36,748 --> 00:49:39,182
-What eIse you got?
-Crab cakes.

619
00:49:39,384 --> 00:49:42,615
With your attitude,
they shouId be ''crabby'' cakes.

620
00:49:42,787 --> 00:49:47,383
Now I'II ask you, have you got
a IittIe wiener and some tiny nuts?

621
00:49:47,559 --> 00:49:50,687
I couId teII by Iooking at you,
that you had...

622
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:56,425
...a IittIe wiener and some
tiny nuts. Oh, yeah.

623
00:49:58,236 --> 00:49:59,635
Hi!

624
00:49:59,804 --> 00:50:04,434
-I was just Iooking for the bathroom.
-In the Iiving room?

625
00:50:04,609 --> 00:50:07,737
You had IoveIy furniture
and I just thought I'd--

626
00:50:08,813 --> 00:50:10,212
I'II show you.

627
00:50:10,381 --> 00:50:14,215
After you freshen up,
join me on the terrace for an aperitif.

628
00:50:14,385 --> 00:50:16,945
It's IoveIy out there.

629
00:50:17,522 --> 00:50:20,150
Oh, yeah! Gotta dance.

630
00:50:44,949 --> 00:50:47,417
Who is this guy?

631
00:50:50,955 --> 00:50:55,324
This idiot is ruining my party.
Bring him to me.

632
00:51:10,942 --> 00:51:14,537
Did you see a dark-haired guy run by?

633
00:51:16,181 --> 00:51:18,649
Dark-haired guy run by, chief?

634
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:23,819
Dark-haired guy go in the water.
Shark in the water.

635
00:51:28,193 --> 00:51:30,127
FareweII and adieu...

636
00:51:30,295 --> 00:51:35,062
-...my wee Spanish Iadies.
-What are you taIking about?

637
00:51:36,968 --> 00:51:37,992
What?

638
00:51:40,305 --> 00:51:41,329
What?

639
00:51:41,706 --> 00:51:46,643
I'm taIking about a great white, chief.
Two ton of him.

640
00:51:46,811 --> 00:51:49,473
Twenty, maybe 25-footer.

641
00:51:50,982 --> 00:51:53,007
There's no shark here.

642
00:51:53,184 --> 00:51:55,652
You sure about that, chief?

643
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:58,687
You ever seen a shark's eyes, chief?

644
00:51:58,857 --> 00:52:04,420
Kind of Iike doIIs' eyes,
aII bIack and IifeIess-Iike.

645
00:52:04,629 --> 00:52:07,223
Twenty nine kids go in the water.

646
00:52:07,398 --> 00:52:10,526
Twenty two kids come out of the water.

647
00:52:10,702 --> 00:52:13,535
The ice cream man, he take the rest.

648
00:52:13,705 --> 00:52:17,197
ApriI the 9th, haIf past 4 p.m.

649
00:52:17,742 --> 00:52:20,609
Wait. Show me your arm.

650
00:52:20,778 --> 00:52:25,215
You want to see my arm, chief?
That's my arm right there, chiefy.

651
00:52:28,553 --> 00:52:32,546
Stop becoming another person.
Stop becoming another person....

652
00:52:32,757 --> 00:52:34,349
It is him!

653
00:52:37,228 --> 00:52:40,561
I run away from the big bIue henchies!

654
00:52:45,169 --> 00:52:48,036
-I stepped on a cow pie!
-Forget about it.

655
00:52:48,206 --> 00:52:51,607
I toId you he wasn't here.
Let's go back.

656
00:52:59,484 --> 00:53:01,452
Fresh air.

657
00:53:05,056 --> 00:53:07,547
I toId you! There he is!

658
00:53:34,018 --> 00:53:39,684
HeIIo. My name's ConstabIe MueIIer
from the Bavarian Tax Authority.

659
00:53:39,857 --> 00:53:40,949
HeIIo.

660
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:45,223
I'm here Iooking
for Ms. Jennifer Baker.

661
00:53:45,530 --> 00:53:48,294
She owes a substantiaI
amount of taxes...

662
00:53:48,466 --> 00:53:53,335
...from her time as an exchange student
at the University of HeideIstrudeI.

663
00:53:53,504 --> 00:53:56,598
I just need to ask her
a coupIe of questions.

664
00:53:56,774 --> 00:54:02,144
Not going to bite her. CouId I just
speak with her for just one moment?

665
00:54:02,313 --> 00:54:04,838
Not going to bite.

666
00:54:08,653 --> 00:54:10,348
-Freak.
-Yes?

667
00:54:10,521 --> 00:54:11,988
Don't move.

668
00:54:12,557 --> 00:54:16,516
-Wait right here.
-Yes, of course. Wait right here.

669
00:54:16,694 --> 00:54:21,495
Doesn't sound too promising.
Maybe it's time to go to pIan B.

670
00:54:21,666 --> 00:54:24,226
You need to reIax. Yes, you do.

671
00:54:24,402 --> 00:54:27,997
God, no. I just--
I don't reaIIy Iike being touched.

672
00:54:29,474 --> 00:54:32,739
-You dropped your purse.
-Thank you. I got it.

673
00:54:32,910 --> 00:54:34,673
Okay.

674
00:54:34,846 --> 00:54:38,976
-Let's see what's in here, shaII we?
-There's nothing inside.

675
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:44,087
I had a IittIe coId, so there's
medicine for that. It's gross in there.

676
00:54:44,288 --> 00:54:48,224
Why don't you come with me, my dear?
This way. Yes.

677
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:52,654
Where did you come from?
Where's the other guy?

678
00:54:52,830 --> 00:54:56,732
Suave. Terry Suave's the name.
London, ScotIand Yard.

679
00:54:56,934 --> 00:54:57,992
What do you want?

680
00:54:58,202 --> 00:55:00,864
It's what the British government wants.

681
00:55:01,039 --> 00:55:04,873
And that's a Miss Jennifer Baker--
At her service....

682
00:55:06,844 --> 00:55:09,870
In regards to Operation Minty Hippo.

683
00:55:10,415 --> 00:55:12,349
Minty Hippo? What is that?

684
00:55:12,517 --> 00:55:15,714
I'd teII you, but it'd be a reaI
ding-dong-ding-wad...

685
00:55:15,887 --> 00:55:19,755
...I need a CharIeston Chew.
Get it? Got it? Doubt it.

686
00:55:19,924 --> 00:55:24,224
-It's time for you to go.
-Put a squeeze on your chat box.

687
00:55:24,595 --> 00:55:26,790
-What?
-This is what you're doing.

688
00:55:26,964 --> 00:55:29,956
This is what I want you to do.
Any questions?

689
00:55:30,201 --> 00:55:34,729
-Did you just teII me to shut up?
-Yes, you catch on straightaway.

690
00:55:34,906 --> 00:55:38,467
The muscIe. Yes, of course.
FamiIiar scenario.

691
00:55:38,709 --> 00:55:40,267
You want to get physicaI?

692
00:55:40,445 --> 00:55:43,471
A bIow to the dewy gumbeI
wouId start things.

693
00:55:43,648 --> 00:55:48,779
FinaIIy, a smack to the didgy dodge.
Did someone yeII, ''Timber''?

694
00:55:48,986 --> 00:55:51,648
Listen. It is okay.

695
00:55:51,856 --> 00:55:54,051
I did receive a Ietter.

696
00:55:54,292 --> 00:55:59,594
She received a Ietter.
Get it? Got it? Doubt it.

697
00:55:59,764 --> 00:56:01,755
Good day to you, sir.

698
00:56:05,603 --> 00:56:07,571
FoIIow them.

699
00:56:15,446 --> 00:56:17,812
I beIieve that DevIin Bowman...

700
00:56:17,982 --> 00:56:22,009
...has forced my papa to become
a Master of Disguise once more...

701
00:56:22,186 --> 00:56:26,885
...in order to steaI rare treasures
from around the worId.

702
00:56:28,693 --> 00:56:34,962
My Disguisey instincts teII me
that they're in the mansion somewhere.

703
00:56:35,166 --> 00:56:37,862
-My tight bIue sweater!
-Sorry, Trent.

704
00:56:38,035 --> 00:56:42,199
-Trent? Who is this?
-Hey, baby. We were just--

705
00:56:42,406 --> 00:56:45,637
Sophia! You, here, with Trent?
What are the odds?

706
00:56:45,810 --> 00:56:48,404
Shut up, cIown.

707
00:56:48,613 --> 00:56:51,639
-Leave him aIone, you buIIy!
-Don't worry.

708
00:56:52,016 --> 00:56:56,851
-The sIapping time, she comes.
-I'm gonna enjoy this.

709
00:56:57,054 --> 00:56:59,852
Pistachio, it demoralizes
your opponent...

710
00:57:00,024 --> 00:57:02,959
...to repeat the phrase,
''Who's your daddy?''

711
00:57:03,127 --> 00:57:04,424
Yes.

712
00:57:04,629 --> 00:57:07,462
Who's your daddy, Trent?

713
00:57:09,634 --> 00:57:11,499
Who's your daddy?

714
00:57:15,706 --> 00:57:17,333
Having fun now, Trent?

715
00:57:19,010 --> 00:57:20,637
How do you do?

716
00:57:37,862 --> 00:57:39,659
Oh, Pistachio!

717
00:57:41,499 --> 00:57:45,765
Thank you for saving me
from that horribIe person.

718
00:57:45,970 --> 00:57:48,530
Let's go, Jennifer.

719
00:57:52,009 --> 00:57:55,740
Hey, my IittIe waiter friend, Pistac--

720
00:58:03,421 --> 00:58:06,584
Thanks for Ietting me borrow
the ApoIIo for my tour.

721
00:58:06,757 --> 00:58:09,590
No probIem, Miss Simpson.
Thanks for the CDs.

722
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:12,354
I hope you Iike them.

723
00:58:21,038 --> 00:58:23,506
Jessica Simpson.

724
00:58:25,509 --> 00:58:28,444
You seem tired, Frabbrizio.

725
00:58:28,613 --> 00:58:29,875
Don't worry.

726
00:58:30,047 --> 00:58:31,810
It's aImost over.

727
00:58:32,016 --> 00:58:34,041
You're insane!

728
00:58:36,821 --> 00:58:40,279
-ThoroughIy insane.
-Am I?

729
00:58:54,972 --> 00:58:57,304
He's asIeep with The Cuteness.

730
00:58:57,541 --> 00:59:03,571
I want to get something off my chest.
Today, when I saw you dressed up...

731
00:59:03,748 --> 00:59:06,080
...Iike the crazy, hairy guy...

732
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:09,686
...at that moment,
I reaIIy thought you were this...

733
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:13,651
...pathetic, insane, absurd...

734
00:59:13,824 --> 00:59:16,657
...spastic IittIe man.

735
00:59:16,827 --> 00:59:22,322
And now I beIieve
that you can do anything.

736
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,298
That's very nice, but not true.

737
00:59:25,469 --> 00:59:31,669
I can't turn mud into oatmeaI, or buiId
a spaceship that wiII traveI to PIuto.

738
00:59:31,876 --> 00:59:37,508
But you can find a way to rescue
your mama and your papa.

739
00:59:38,082 --> 00:59:41,609
Yes. Yes, I beIieve now too.

740
00:59:41,786 --> 00:59:46,189
Your pep taIk has transformed me,
tiny butter-bottom. I mean, Jennifer.

741
00:59:46,357 --> 00:59:48,723
You said, ''Tiny butter-bottom.''

742
00:59:48,893 --> 00:59:53,125
Did I, the future mother of my babies?
I mean, Jennifer?

743
00:59:53,331 --> 00:59:55,959
You said,
''Future mother of my babies.''

744
00:59:56,133 --> 01:00:00,229
Did I, fat-cat mama
with the red dress on? I mean--

745
01:00:00,404 --> 01:00:03,840
-You said, ''Fat-cat''--
-I don't know why I said that.

746
01:00:04,008 --> 01:00:08,502
It just was the emotion. It just....

747
01:00:09,347 --> 01:00:12,373
My first kiss.

748
01:00:12,817 --> 01:00:16,412
I must apoIogize,
I was a IittIe forward.

749
01:00:16,620 --> 01:00:20,716
But perhaps you enjoyed a IittIe bit?

750
01:00:20,891 --> 01:00:23,758
You know what time it is?

751
01:00:26,897 --> 01:00:31,027
No, I don't know.
I don't know what time it is.

752
01:00:31,635 --> 01:00:33,330
Time to make a pIan.

753
01:00:33,537 --> 01:00:36,506
Ah, yes. Yes.

754
01:00:36,674 --> 01:00:40,735
Back to business.
The pIanning time, she comes.

755
01:00:40,945 --> 01:00:42,640
Okay.

756
01:00:43,180 --> 01:00:48,174
-AII right.
-It's okay. It's okay. Nice.

757
01:00:48,352 --> 01:00:50,752
-Fresh too. Night.
-Night.

758
01:00:51,055 --> 01:00:53,580
-Night now.
-Good night.

759
01:01:04,668 --> 01:01:06,465
The Cuteness was on guard.

760
01:01:06,670 --> 01:01:10,037
But he'd be no match
against Bowman's henchmen...

761
01:01:10,207 --> 01:01:14,109
...who had orders to kidnap Jennifer.
Time was running out...

762
01:01:14,278 --> 01:01:19,773
...as Bowman put the final touches
on his evil scheme.

763
01:01:20,618 --> 01:01:25,578
Grandfather, pIease, I need your heIp.
I am out of ideas.

764
01:01:33,764 --> 01:01:37,063
Grandfather,
you are a big fIoating head.

765
01:01:37,268 --> 01:01:40,431
I'm a prerecorded hoIogram.
What's your question?

766
01:01:40,604 --> 01:01:44,631
I have not mustered enough Energico
to overcome our enemies.

767
01:01:44,809 --> 01:01:46,936
I was hoping you'd be here.

768
01:01:47,111 --> 01:01:50,911
-What you doing here?
-My mom's missing, but I found this.

769
01:01:51,081 --> 01:01:53,982
-Bowman's cigar.
-Is my mom okay?

770
01:01:54,351 --> 01:01:56,819
She's just out buying cigars now.

771
01:01:56,987 --> 01:01:58,352
We have work to do!

772
01:01:58,522 --> 01:02:02,151
I need a disguise to get
into the Bowman mansion.

773
01:02:02,326 --> 01:02:04,760
-How about if you dress--?
-SiIence!

774
01:02:04,929 --> 01:02:07,693
Grandpa, why don't we
give him a chance?

775
01:02:07,865 --> 01:02:10,425
Sometimes out of the mouth
of babies....

776
01:02:10,634 --> 01:02:12,829
AII right, but quietIy.

777
01:02:13,003 --> 01:02:15,631
You never know who might be Iistening.

778
01:02:15,806 --> 01:02:18,969
That's crazy. So crazy--

779
01:02:19,143 --> 01:02:22,977
It just might work!

780
01:02:24,982 --> 01:02:30,352
Feast your eyes! Some of the worId's
greatest treasures. The Liberty BeII.

781
01:02:30,521 --> 01:02:33,615
There's Mona Lisa.
The ruby sIippers.

782
01:02:33,824 --> 01:02:36,725
A Betsy Ross originaI.
How about that David?

783
01:02:36,894 --> 01:02:40,455
We got Bruce WiIIis' hairpiece
from Die Hard 2.

784
01:02:40,631 --> 01:02:45,000
One of my prized possessions here,
the ApoIIo 1 1 Lunar ModuIe.

785
01:02:45,169 --> 01:02:47,330
Yep. One smaII step for man.

786
01:02:47,872 --> 01:02:52,241
BIack MarkEbay has a poIicy
of not asking how items are obtained.

787
01:02:52,409 --> 01:02:55,572
But in your case, I am curious.

788
01:02:55,813 --> 01:02:59,010
ItaIy's own Frabbrizio Disguisey.

789
01:02:59,183 --> 01:03:01,845
Okay, so it is the Master of Disguise.

790
01:03:02,019 --> 01:03:04,351
Want to see him?

791
01:03:10,694 --> 01:03:15,495
-So you're gonna auction him off?
-Too easy.

792
01:03:18,502 --> 01:03:20,402
-It's you.
-Right.

793
01:03:20,571 --> 01:03:24,166
I'm going to Krazy GIue this
to Frabbrizio's head.

794
01:03:24,341 --> 01:03:29,506
Then tomorrow, I'II push him over
a cIiff. Everyone wiII think I'm dead.

795
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:33,013
It's caIIed the perfect crime.
Ever heard of it?

796
01:03:33,183 --> 01:03:35,777
Let me show you the rest of the items.

797
01:03:35,953 --> 01:03:38,387
Mr. Bowman, no cherry pie?

798
01:03:39,757 --> 01:03:41,452
Later, PaImer. Come on.

799
01:03:43,260 --> 01:03:46,627
I don't even know where
this cherry pie came from.

800
01:03:46,830 --> 01:03:48,354
Go figure.

801
01:04:05,349 --> 01:04:08,910
These cherries are so tickIish.

802
01:04:09,086 --> 01:04:10,986
And sIippery.

803
01:04:16,594 --> 01:04:19,358
The Cuteness, this is dangerous.
Go home.

804
01:04:32,810 --> 01:04:35,904
It's Cherry Pie Man! Get him!

805
01:04:49,393 --> 01:04:53,090
Jennifer was forced to be
the Black MarkEBay spokesmodel...

806
01:04:53,263 --> 01:04:56,460
...as our nation's treasures
were auctioned off.

807
01:04:56,634 --> 01:04:58,659
The famous ''We the People. ''

808
01:04:58,836 --> 01:05:00,804
Yo, Doug. Check this out.

809
01:05:05,676 --> 01:05:11,308
Did it ever occur to you that this
cherry pie thing was Frabbrizio's son?!

810
01:05:12,483 --> 01:05:14,212
No matter.

811
01:05:14,451 --> 01:05:17,352
Oh, by the way, Steve,
your wife caIIed.

812
01:05:17,521 --> 01:05:21,218
-Oh, that's great. Thank you, sir.
-Sure.

813
01:05:21,425 --> 01:05:24,519
You're not married!

814
01:05:27,297 --> 01:05:28,924
Pistachio?

815
01:05:30,334 --> 01:05:32,427
Now we got you.

816
01:05:32,636 --> 01:05:35,730
How did you know it was me?

817
01:05:49,753 --> 01:05:51,243
Who's your daddy?

818
01:06:22,786 --> 01:06:26,483
This IittIe dude is sIapping
these ninja guys senseIess!

819
01:06:31,228 --> 01:06:33,788
-I set you free!
-That's my beIt!

820
01:06:34,798 --> 01:06:36,925
-Wait! Ninjas!
-Out of the way!

821
01:06:40,204 --> 01:06:42,297
Anyone who stays gets a raise!

822
01:06:44,441 --> 01:06:46,773
No way! He sIap us siIIy!

823
01:06:47,311 --> 01:06:49,609
You may want to see this.

824
01:06:49,813 --> 01:06:51,576
Smorgasbord.

825
01:06:56,420 --> 01:06:57,512
Mama, Iook out!

826
01:07:05,062 --> 01:07:08,463
No more carameI corn for me.

827
01:07:11,068 --> 01:07:14,629
-Pistachio.
-Grandpapa.

828
01:07:14,805 --> 01:07:18,138
I wanted to witness
your first Disguisey victory.

829
01:07:18,308 --> 01:07:21,141
Hey, Disguiseys, it's not over yet.

830
01:07:21,311 --> 01:07:24,041
First you wiII see who is your daddy.

831
01:07:26,617 --> 01:07:31,645
I was going to throw him off a cIiff.
Instead, I'II have him kiII you.

832
01:07:43,934 --> 01:07:46,528
-Papa. Papa!
-I am not your Papa.

833
01:07:46,703 --> 01:07:50,161
He must have been puIIed
to the dark side of Energico.

834
01:07:50,340 --> 01:07:53,207
There's a dark side?
ExactIy Iike Star Wars?

835
01:07:53,377 --> 01:07:58,781
-I am DevIin Bowman!
-No, Papa, you are not Bowman.

836
01:07:58,982 --> 01:08:04,648
Take off your mask. Let's aII go grab
a bite to eat at the OIive Garden.

837
01:08:05,222 --> 01:08:08,316
I am DevIin Bowman!

838
01:08:08,725 --> 01:08:11,990
I have a secret underground Iair...

839
01:08:12,162 --> 01:08:15,495
...fiIIed with rare objects!

840
01:08:15,732 --> 01:08:18,132
Because of you Disguiseys...

841
01:08:18,302 --> 01:08:22,830
...I spent 20 years
in the PaIermo State Penitentiary.

842
01:08:23,006 --> 01:08:24,837
I hate you!

843
01:08:25,242 --> 01:08:27,733
-But, Papa--
-Pistachio!

844
01:08:27,911 --> 01:08:30,106
This is between father and son.

845
01:08:30,314 --> 01:08:33,511
-I am not your papa!
-Pistachio, be carefuI!

846
01:08:33,684 --> 01:08:37,620
-You are my papa! I swear you are.
-No, I am not!

847
01:08:47,564 --> 01:08:49,896
-Goodbye, peanut!
-No, Papa!

848
01:08:53,704 --> 01:08:56,104
-Use the Energico, Pistachio!
-Yes.

849
01:08:56,273 --> 01:08:59,037
Papa Bowman.
PIease, don't you remember?

850
01:08:59,209 --> 01:09:02,406
I'd put the underwear on my head.
You'd take it off.

851
01:09:02,579 --> 01:09:05,139
Those were the days. Right?

852
01:09:05,716 --> 01:09:08,583
What are you taIking about?

853
01:09:08,752 --> 01:09:12,882
Underwear coming....
Stuck in butt crack....

854
01:09:16,860 --> 01:09:21,126
His underwear's on his head.
Just Iike when he was a IittIe boy!

855
01:09:21,298 --> 01:09:26,793
-Take those underwear off your head!
-Take that mask off your face.

856
01:09:31,909 --> 01:09:34,036
Papa!

857
01:09:35,579 --> 01:09:38,377
Moustache, Papa! Yes!

858
01:09:38,982 --> 01:09:42,213
The nose! Yes!

859
01:09:42,686 --> 01:09:47,885
Get the eye. Another! Yes!
Papa! Papa! Yes!

860
01:09:52,963 --> 01:09:54,590
My son.

861
01:09:54,798 --> 01:09:57,096
It's Frabbrizio!

862
01:09:59,102 --> 01:10:01,297
PuII him up!

863
01:10:03,140 --> 01:10:06,007
-The Disguisey tradition.
-Papa free!

864
01:10:06,209 --> 01:10:07,938
So we freed Mama.

865
01:10:08,111 --> 01:10:11,945
Jennifer became Mrs. Disguisey.
And Barney got a papa.

866
01:10:12,115 --> 01:10:18,111
Finally, Pistachio became
a Master of Disguise.

867
01:10:18,755 --> 01:10:20,814
There was one thing left to do.

868
01:10:22,359 --> 01:10:25,294
We had to get the Constitution
from Bowman.

869
01:10:28,265 --> 01:10:29,664
Can I get you anything?

870
01:10:29,866 --> 01:10:32,664
What do you get a man
who has everything?

871
01:10:32,836 --> 01:10:36,101
I can't beIieve it,
it's President Bush!

872
01:10:36,273 --> 01:10:37,331
What?

873
01:10:37,774 --> 01:10:39,503
Good to see you.

874
01:10:39,676 --> 01:10:43,476
-Mr. President?
-FoIks around here caII me ''W''...

875
01:10:43,647 --> 01:10:47,048
...but you can caII me King George.

876
01:10:50,620 --> 01:10:52,451
That was a joke, son.

877
01:10:52,622 --> 01:10:55,022
Mind if we had a picture together?

878
01:10:55,258 --> 01:10:59,194
Take your time. I'm ready.
Say, ''Who's your daddy?''

879
01:10:59,363 --> 01:11:01,695
-Sir?
-This is what you're doing.

880
01:11:01,865 --> 01:11:04,197
This is what I want you to do.
Questions?

881
01:11:04,368 --> 01:11:06,029
It's you!

882
01:11:06,203 --> 01:11:11,197
Yes. Yes, it is me,
the Master of Disguise.

883
01:11:13,176 --> 01:11:15,041
-Get him!
-We're Disguiseys.

884
01:11:15,212 --> 01:11:18,545
-I think I stepped in a cow pie.
-Forget about it.

885
01:11:18,715 --> 01:11:21,047
Bring on the heat.

886
01:11:21,284 --> 01:11:23,775
I came to get the Constitution back.

887
01:11:25,322 --> 01:11:28,018
And this one's for you, chiefy!

888
01:11:35,365 --> 01:11:37,299
Is he dead?

889
01:11:40,904 --> 01:11:43,304
Bowman, he make the stinky.

890
01:11:44,074 --> 01:11:46,065
-Who's!
-Your!

891
01:11:46,243 --> 01:11:48,006
Daddy!

892
01:12:24,748 --> 01:12:28,240
Say heIIo to my IittIe friend.

893
01:12:33,990 --> 01:12:37,118
By the authority
of the Disguisey tradition...

894
01:12:37,294 --> 01:12:39,228
...page 73 of the pop-up book...

895
01:12:39,396 --> 01:12:42,797
...I hereby pronounce you wife, son...

896
01:12:42,966 --> 01:12:47,266
...and Master of Disguise.

897
01:12:47,437 --> 01:12:50,099
Bravo, my son, bravo.

898
01:12:55,245 --> 01:12:59,272
I shot an eIephant in my pajamas.
How he got there, I'II never know.

899
01:12:59,449 --> 01:13:02,680
I'd Iike to spin you
on your spineIy-spobbIy spibbIy.

900
01:13:02,886 --> 01:13:06,617
Oh, baby going to cry?
His mommy caIIed?

901
01:13:11,595 --> 01:13:13,654
And cut.

902
01:13:15,899 --> 01:13:19,335
-Run, Jennifer, run!
-Pistachio!

903
01:13:19,503 --> 01:13:20,697
And...

904
01:13:20,904 --> 01:13:22,633
...action!

905
01:13:35,218 --> 01:13:39,416
I Iike the juice. You Iike the juice?

906
01:13:39,623 --> 01:13:43,115
Sometimes that Master of Disguise
go away.

907
01:13:43,293 --> 01:13:45,693
Sometimes he don't go away.

908
01:13:45,929 --> 01:13:47,226
Okay, now...

909
01:13:47,430 --> 01:13:49,796
...the Master of Disguise...

910
01:13:49,966 --> 01:13:53,527
...can he change into, say...

911
01:13:54,237 --> 01:13:57,331
-...Barbra Streisand?
-Of course.

912
01:13:57,507 --> 01:14:01,637
-Britney Spears?
-You're a sick man.

913
01:14:02,679 --> 01:14:04,806
The OIsen twins?

914
01:14:17,027 --> 01:14:20,258
There's a nice,
cooI IittIe moustache there...

915
01:14:20,463 --> 01:14:25,400
...on the big, baId, mean guy's face.
That's refreshing.

916
01:14:25,569 --> 01:14:26,763
HoId!

917
01:14:26,970 --> 01:14:28,437
HoId!

918
01:14:28,605 --> 01:14:30,004
HoId!

919
01:14:30,173 --> 01:14:31,902
UnIeash heII.

920
01:15:00,570 --> 01:15:04,131
I never knew if I'd see Jenny again.

921
01:15:04,307 --> 01:15:07,299
-I've seen your type before.
-What are you doing?

922
01:15:07,510 --> 01:15:11,241
I'm Gammy Num Num.
Then take a gammy of my nummy-nums.

923
01:15:11,448 --> 01:15:15,407
We don't want to go anywhere
with you, meIonhead.

924
01:15:23,159 --> 01:15:25,218
You fiIthy thief!

925
01:15:25,395 --> 01:15:29,593
Take that! And that! And that!

926
01:15:34,838 --> 01:15:37,500
Buttercup says you are a bad man.

927
01:15:37,674 --> 01:15:39,403
I'm not the dummy, he is.

928
01:15:39,576 --> 01:15:44,070
Can you beIieve how stiff he is?
And I'm the one made of wood.

929
01:15:56,126 --> 01:15:59,323
I don't want any trou-bubbIes!

930
01:16:00,664 --> 01:16:02,427
You got a IittIe wiener--

931
01:16:02,599 --> 01:16:05,124
Get the bee out. I won't pIay games.

932
01:16:05,302 --> 01:16:09,762
-You got a IittIe wiener-- Go away.
-Got a IittIe bee.

933
01:16:09,939 --> 01:16:13,636
There's no wiener.
There's just a bee.

934
01:16:16,079 --> 01:16:21,483
I stiII have the greatest
anti-Disguisey weapon of aII.

935
01:16:24,521 --> 01:16:28,617
There's a dark side?
ExactIy Iike Star Wars?

936
01:16:32,862 --> 01:16:36,195
-What's going on?
-Pistachio's in grave danger.

937
01:16:36,399 --> 01:16:37,991
Pistachio, come back!

938
01:16:39,869 --> 01:16:41,200
A bottom.

939
01:16:51,114 --> 01:16:54,481
Yes. I see now.

940
01:16:54,651 --> 01:16:58,644
Love is thicker than your behinds.

941
01:17:00,223 --> 01:17:02,214
Look what Daddy made for you.

942
01:17:02,392 --> 01:17:06,658
A IittIe sweater. I knit it Iast night
for you, IittIe Buttercup.

943
01:17:06,830 --> 01:17:10,698
My name is GIuteus Maximus.
Are you not entertained?

944
01:17:10,867 --> 01:17:14,234
Why are your arms around
the tush queen?

945
01:17:14,404 --> 01:17:18,397
Wait, I screwed it up.
She's the cake. You're the queen.

946
01:17:18,575 --> 01:17:23,069
And remember,
Humpty Dumpty sat on the waII.

947
01:17:23,246 --> 01:17:28,741
No one reaIIy had a cIue what he
was doing up there in the first pIace.

948
01:17:41,164 --> 01:17:44,861
-Now show me some toys.
-Toys? Yes, of course. Toys. Here.

949
01:17:45,034 --> 01:17:49,368
How about this?
This is the worId's first giant yo-yo.

950
01:17:49,539 --> 01:17:53,566
Oopsie-cadabra.
It Iooks more Iike a no-yo.

951
01:18:08,324 --> 01:18:10,121
HeIIo?

952
01:18:10,493 --> 01:18:12,120
What?

953
01:18:18,968 --> 01:18:20,595
HeIIo?

954
01:18:29,412 --> 01:18:31,141
What?

955
01:18:31,514 --> 01:18:34,506
Who--?
Who are you?

956
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:38,585
What were you doing
in the sIapping dummy?

957
01:18:38,755 --> 01:18:40,416
SIap!

958
01:18:40,757 --> 01:18:46,195
Come back here, sIapping-dummy man.
It was you aII aIong, aII the time.

959
01:18:46,362 --> 01:18:50,526
You were the one. I'm going
to get you. I'm going to get you.

960
01:18:50,767 --> 01:18:54,203
Now, aII right, aII right.
Let's not fight.

961
01:18:54,370 --> 01:19:00,002
I just want to taIk, okay?
Now, Iisten. I just want to taIk to you.

962
01:19:00,176 --> 01:19:01,871
I sIap you!

963
01:19:05,248 --> 01:19:07,375
Come back here!

964
01:19:08,384 --> 01:19:12,115
Come back here, sIapping-dummy man.

965
01:19:15,558 --> 01:19:17,048
I'II get you, Pistachio.

966
01:19:17,293 --> 01:19:20,524
-PIease, sIapping-dummy man.
-I'II get you.

967
01:19:20,697 --> 01:19:23,689
-I didn't mean it.
-I'II get you, Pistachio.

968
01:19:23,867 --> 01:19:27,769
-I didn't mean it, sIapping-dummy man.
-I'II get you.

969
01:19:28,638 --> 01:19:32,199
So we find a nest,
and then we started training.

970
01:19:32,375 --> 01:19:36,038
And then we go to the sIapping
dummy, no offense.

971
01:19:36,212 --> 01:19:41,081
But you gave me quite a workout a few
times. You must reaIIy Iove to sIap.

972
01:19:41,284 --> 01:19:44,219
-I Iove to sIap.
-Yes, you Iove to sIap, yes.

973
01:19:44,387 --> 01:19:48,050
What are you peopIe stiII doing here?
You saw the movie.

974
01:19:48,224 --> 01:19:51,716
I'm trying to taIk. AII right? Goodbye.

975
01:19:51,895 --> 01:19:53,726
AII right, so anyway....

976
01:19:54,197 --> 01:19:57,189
-Pistachio, I'm sad.
-What is the matter?

977
01:19:57,367 --> 01:20:00,768
-I want to say goodbye.
-AII right. We fade up.

978
01:20:00,937 --> 01:20:03,371
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

979
01:20:08,678 --> 01:20:10,441
No more dog food.

980
01:20:10,613 --> 01:20:12,012
TurtIe, turtIe!
