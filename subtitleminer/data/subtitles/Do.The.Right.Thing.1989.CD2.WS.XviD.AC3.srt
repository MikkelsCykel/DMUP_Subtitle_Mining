Daddy, you know,
I've been thinking?

57
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,200
Maybe we should sell this place?

58
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,600
Get out while we're still ahead??

59
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,400
And alive?

60
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,600
You really thinkyou know
what's best for us, Pino?

61
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,200
I mean, couldn't we sell this

62
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,200
and open up a new one
in our own neighborhood?

63
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,600
There's too many pizzerias
already there?

64
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,200
Maybe we could try
something different?

65
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,200
What am I going to do?

66
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,600
That's all I know?

67
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,400

69
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,200
It's like I come to work??

70
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,600
It's "Planet of the Apes?"

71
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,200
I don't like being around them?

72
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,400
They're animals?

73
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Whyyou got so much anger in you?

74
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,000

75
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,400
My friends...
They laugh at me?

76
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,000
They laugh right in my face?

77
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,400
They tell me,
"Go to Bed-Stuy?

78
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,200
Go feed the moulies?"

79
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,400
Doyour friends put money
in your pocket, Pino?

80
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,000
Food on your table?

81
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,400

82
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,600
Huh?

83
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,000
They're not your friends?

84
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,000

I don't want to be here?

88
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,600
They don't want us here?

89
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,600
We should stay
in our own neighborhood,

90
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,600
in Bensonurst,

91
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,200
and niggers in theirs?

92
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,400
I never had no trouble
with these people?

93
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,600
I sat in this window??

94
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,600
All I see is
little kids get old?

95
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,600
And I seen
the old people get older?

96
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,600
Yeah, sure,
some of them don't like us,

97
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
but most of them do?

98
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,600
I mean, for chrissake, Pino,
they grew up on my food?

99
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,200
On my food?

100
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,200
I'm very proud ofthat?

101
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,200
You may think it's funny,

102
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,000
but I'm very proud ofthat?

103
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,000

You're really crude, Mookie?

Do not come in Sal's anymore?

452

You can't payyour rent,
and you're lecturing me?

458
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,400
That makes no sense?

459
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,800
Oh, it doesn't, huh?

Don't worry?

466
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,000
When, Mookie?

467
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,400
Don't worry about it?

468
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,200
Don't come here no more?

469
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,200
We're not talking about that?

470
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,000
I'm tired ofsupporting
a grown woman, OK?

471
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,000
I'm tired ofsupporting

When areyou going
to pack up and go?

473
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,800
Don't come in Sal's no more?

474
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
And no more pizza, either?

475
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,000
I don't care ifyou fire me

476
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000

477

00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,400
you better not say it?

480
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,000
You hear this?

481
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Do me a favor?
LeaveJade alone?

482
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,400
You know, Mookie,
not for nothir,

483
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,400
but ifyou were
just a little taller,

484
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,400
I'd kickyour ass
forwhatyou're thinking?

485
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,400
As a matter offact,

486
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,200
I should kickyour ass
on principle alone?

487
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,400
Here?
You got a delivery?

488
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,000
This the right address?

That's the right address?

492
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,400
I wrote it myself?

493
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,000
Sometimes you make mistakes,

494
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,600
and I deliver fucking pizzas

495
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,400

496
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,000
I don't make mistakes?

497
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,600

00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,400
Make a pizza, huh?

501
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,600
Mr? Mayor?

502
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,200
I saw whatyou did?

503
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,200
That was foolish but brave?

504
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,600
That child owes you his life?

505
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,200
Wasrt trying to be a hero?

506
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,600
I just seen what was happening,

507
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,000
and I reacted... didn't even think?

508
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Probablywouldn't have done it

509
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,400
ifl had thought?

510
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,800
Da Mayor's getting old?

511
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,400
Ain't run like that in years?

512
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,800
Went from first to home
on a bunt single?

513
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,400
Scored the winning run?

514
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,800
Two outs?
Bottom of the ninth?

515
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,400
August 1, 1939?
Snow Hill, Alabama?

516
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,000
Mud Cat Bones
was the pitcher?

517
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,400
He hated my guts?

518
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,600
He come down offthat mound,

519
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,200
and I took off

520
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,000
like white lightning
up a black snake's ass?

521
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Maybe I, uh??

522
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,600
Maybe I ought to be
a hero more often?

523
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,200
Maybeyou shouldn't?

524
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,600
Don't get happy?

525
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,400
This changes nothing
between you and me?

526
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,200
You did a good thing?

527
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,200
Mother Sisterjust thanks you?

528
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,000
I want to thankyou?

529
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,200
You're welcome?

530
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,000
Delivery from
Sal's Famous Pizzeria?

531
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,000
Is it hot?

532
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,600
I've never delivered a cold pizza?

533
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,600
Come here?

534
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,000
You thinkyou're slick, Tina?

535
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,600
How else could
I getyou up here?

536
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,200
I haven't seen you all week?

537
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,600
I'm working?
Making money?

538
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,200
You forgot the ice cream again?

539
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,400
I forgot?

540
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,000
Your memory's getting ridiculous?

541
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,400
I got things on my mind?

542
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,000
I reallywanted some ice cream?

543
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,400
I'll run out and get some?

544
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,400
No, no? That's out?
You won't come back?

545
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,400
I can't be staying long?

546
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,600
How long?

547
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,200
Long enough to do the nasty?

548
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,200
Come on, Mookie?
That's out?

549
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,400
First of all, it's too hot?

550
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,200
Lfyou think

551
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,600

553
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000

554
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,400
I'll seeyou tomorrow?

555
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,400
Yeah, right?

556
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,200
So no nasty, huh?

557
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,400
No?

558
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,600
Something else?

559
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,600
What?

560
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,800
Trust me?

561
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,200
Last time I trusted you,
we got a son?

562
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,200
Remember him?

563
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,600
His name's Hector?

564
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,000
You saying I'm a bad father?

565
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,200
On the strength?

566
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,200
Let me talk toyou?

567
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,200
What? What?

568
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,600
Over here?

569
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,000
Tina, takeyour clothes off?

570
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,400
I already told you

571
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,400
it's too fucking hot
to make love?

572
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,000
It's too fucking hot?

573
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Why are you always cursing?

574
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,400
I don't fucking curse that much?

575
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,400
What the hell you mean?

576
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,400
All you do is curse?

577
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,400
Anyway, no rawness
is jumping offtonight?

578
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,000
All right?
That's it?

579
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,200
No rawness?

580
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,600
No? No rawness?

581
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,600
Why's it always like that

582
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,200
when you come over?

583
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,000
It's not always like that?

584
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,600
It's always...
What areyou doing?

585
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,000
I'm not cursing?

586
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,600
Mookie? Come on?

587
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,200
I mean it?
I'm not playing?

588
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,600
I'm not playing?

589
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,400
Don't be so anxious?

590
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,400
That's right?
Take it off?

591
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,200
You're sweating?

592
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,600
Of course I'm sweating?

593
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,200
It's only 100 degrees in here?

594
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,600
Look, freeze?
Don't move?

595
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,200
I'll be right back?

596
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,200
What doyou mean
you'll be right back?

597
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,600
Where areyou going?

598
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,200
I'll be right back?

599
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,000
Whyyou got me
standing on the bed?

600
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,400
Whereyou going?

601
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,000
How's my son, Hector?

602
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,000
Honey, doyou hear that?

603
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,000
He wants to know
howyou are doing?

604
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:28,000
And he has the straight face
of asking about it?

605
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,400
Sinverguenza.

606
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,000
Good for nothing?

607
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,400
Callejero.

608
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,400
Que se la pasa por la calle... -

609
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,000
English! English!

610
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,400
I want my son speaking English?

611
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,400
Get out of my kitchen?

612
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,200
Bad enough his name's Hector?

613
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,200
Get out of my kitchen?

614
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,600
I don't want to hear anything?

615
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,200
Out, I said?

616
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,400
Yes, children?

617
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,600
This is the cool-out corner?

618
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,400
We're slowing it down

619
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,800
for all the lovers in the house?

620
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,400
I'll be giving you
all the helpyou need?

621
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,600
Musically, that is?

622
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,200
This shit is cold?

623
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,000
Supposed to be cold?
It's an ice cube?

624
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,400
Later foryour shit?

625
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,000
Mira.

626
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,400
Mira.

627
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,400
What?

628
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,400
You don't got a forehead?

629
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,400
You got a eight-head?

630
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,400
Mookie, you're full of shit?

631
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,400
You got one of them
Sade foreheads?

632
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,400
Fuckyou?

633
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,600
Goddamn?
Big-ass forehead?

634
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,400
I need an iceberg??

635
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,400
Rather than this ice cube?

636
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,200
Thank God for lips?

637
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,600
Thank God for the neck?

638
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,200
Thank God for kneecaps?

639
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,600
Thank God for elbows?

640
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,800
Thank God for thighs?

641
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,400
Thank God
for the right nipple?

642
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,400
Thank God
for the left nipple?

643
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,400
Feels good?

644
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,400
Ah? You likes?
You likes?

645
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,200
You likes?

646
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,600
Amen?

647
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,800
I got to be going?

648
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,400
You better come back?

649
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,800
I'll be back tonight?

650
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,800
You better,
'cause I'll kickyour ass?

651
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Oops? I got to be back then?

652
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,600
All right?

653
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,200
All right?

654
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,400
All right?

655
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,000
Get out ofhere?

656
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,600
I got to go?

657
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,800
Bye?

658
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,000
I'm not leaving yet?

659
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,400
Get out ofhere?

660
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,000
All right? Later?

661
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,200
Later?

662
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,000
Just out of curiosity,

663
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,400
how long you
sticking around here?

664
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,000
You mean tonight?

665
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,600
I mean the neighborhood?

666
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,600
I figure about 50 years?

667
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,200
'Cause I'm going into real estate?

668
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:09,400
I'll put up a high-rise

00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,600
Leave him alone?

00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:12,200
You see how they had him
in a choke hold?

1010
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:15,200
I knew that choke hold
would kill him!

1011
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,600
You might have saved him!

1012
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,200
A fucking radio!

1013
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,600
He died because ofa fucking radio!

1014
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:23,600
He wanted pictures
on the wall, and he died!

1015
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,600

a fucking man, Mookie?

1174
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,200
I'm so tired ofyour shit?

1175
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,200
Why do we have to
go over this again?

1176
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,600
Becauseyou don't
fucking listen, Mookie!

1177
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:31,200
Lfyou listen to me,

1178
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:33,200
I wouldn't have to repeat myself

1179
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:34,600
like a fucking radio!

1180
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:36,600
What kind of motheryou are

1181
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:38,200
using fucking language like that?

1182
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:40,200
What kind of mother am I?

1183
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:42,200
Your ass isn't even here!

1184
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:43,800
Get anothervocabulary, right?

1185
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,400

1186
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:46,600
Yeah? Look??

1188
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:49,200
I'll be back?

1189
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,200
Don't leave, Mookie?
Don't leave?

1190
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,800
I'm tired ofthis shit?

1191
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:55,200
You walk out that door, that's it?

1192
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:56,200
All right?

1193
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:00,800
I have to get my money from Sal?
I'll be back?

1194
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,800
Your shit's to the curb,
and I'm tired ofit?

1195
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,200
You need to step off

1196
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,000
with your stupid-ass self?

1197
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:11,000
You need to get
a fucking life, Mookie,

1198
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,600
because the oneyou got
is not working!

1199
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:17,200
I ain't going to deal
with this shit no more!

1200
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,200
Shit?
Fucking ass, stupid ass,

1201
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:20,800
fucking pendejo.

1202
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,600
Shit? Fuck?
Fucking shit?

1203
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:26,400
Good morning?

1204
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:30,600
Is it a good morning?

1205
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:33,000
Yes, indeed?

1206
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:36,200
You almost gotyourself
killed last night?

1207
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,800
I've done that before?

1208
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,600
Where did you sleep?

1209
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,000
I didn't?

1210
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:57,200
I hope the block is still standing?

1211
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:59,000
We're still standing?

1212
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:41,400
What doyou want?

1213
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:43,800
I want my money?
I want to get paid?

1214
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
You don't work here no more?

1215
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:47,200
I want my money?

1216
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:49,200
Your money couldn't begin to pay

1217
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,600
for the windowyou broke?

1218
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,200
Motherfuck a window?
Radio Raheem is dead?

1219
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:55,600
I know he's dead?
I was here, remember?

1220
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:57,600
He's dead because ofhis buddy?

1221
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,200
That cocksucker started this shit?

1222
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:01,200
He's responsible
for that kid's death?

1223
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:02,600
He wanted to close me,

1224
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:05,200
and you stood there like a fuck

1225
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:07,200
and watched them
burn me down!

1226
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:09,600
I also watched the cops
murder Radio Raheem?

1227
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:13,200
You'll get it all
from the insurance anyway, Sal?

1228
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,200
What the fuck's
wrong with you?

1229
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,400
This ain't about money?

1230
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:18,400
I could give a fuck
about money?

1231
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:19,600
You see this place?

1232
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:22,200
I built this fucking place!

1233
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:24,400
With my bare fucking hands!

1234
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:27,400
Every light socket,
every piece oftile?

1235
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:29,400
Me! With these fucking hands!

1236
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,400
You know what that means?

1237
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:34,000
It means pay me
my motherfucking money?

1238
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:35,600
That's what it means, Sal?

1239
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:37,600
OK, Mookie?

1240
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:40,000
How much do I oweyou?

1241
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:43,400
My salary is 250?
250 a week?

1242
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,400
1??

1243
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:54,400
That's 2??

1244
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:56,800
That's 3??

1245
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,600
That's 4??

1246
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,600
And that's 5?

1247
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:03,400
You got $500?
You're a rich fucking man?

1248
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:05,600
Are you happy?
You happy?

1249
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:08,600
He's got 500 fucking dollars!

1250
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:10,200
He's a big man!

1251
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:12,000
He's a rich fucking man!

1252
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:15,400
He's never going to have
any more trouble!

1253
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:16,600
Not Mookie!

1254
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,200
He's fucking rich!

1255
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:19,800
Who the fuckyou yelling at?

1256
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:21,400
You're wealthy, Mookie?

1257
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:23,400
You're a real fucking Rockefeller?

1258
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:27,800
You gotyour fucking pay?
Now leave me alone?

1259
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,800
Sal, my salary's 250 a week,
all right?

1260
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,600
I oweyou 50 bucks?

1261
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:35,600
Keep it?

1262
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:36,600
You keep it?

1263
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:37,600
You keep it?

1264
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:38,600
You keep it?

1265
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:39,600
No, you keep it?

1266
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:41,000
You keep it?

1267
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:46,600
I don't believe this shit?

1268
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:48,000
Believe it?

1269
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:51,600
Areyou sick?

1270
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:55,600
I'm hot as a motherfucker?
I'm all right, though?

1271
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:59,400
Well, they say it's even going
to get hotter today?

1272
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:05,400
What areyou going
to do with yourself?

1273
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:07,600
Make that money?
Get paid?

1274
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:11,200
Sal, I got to go see my son

1275
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:13,800
ifit's all right with you?

1276
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,400
Hey, Mook.
It's the Mook man.

1277
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:27,200
I seeyou walking.
Go home toyour kid.

1278
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:28,800
Now the news and weather.

1279
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,800
Our mayor has commissioned
a blue-ribbon panel...

1280
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,800
"to get to the bottom

1281
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,200
oflast night's disturbance.

1282
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:36,600
The City ofNew York

1283
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:39,200
will not let property
be destroyed by anyone."

1284
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,200
His Honor plans to visit
our block today.

1285
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:43,600
He should hook up
with our own Da Mayor,

1286
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,200
buy him a beer.

1287
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:47,800
Your Love Daddy
says register to vote.

1288
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,800
The election is coming up.

1289
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:52,800
There 's no end in sight
from this heat wave,

1290
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,200
so today,
the cash money word is chill.

1291
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:57,600
That's right. C-h-i-l-I.

1292
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:01,400
When you hear "chill,"

coming atyou from
what's last on your dial

1296
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:10,400
but first in your hearts,

1297
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:13,000
and that's
the quintessential truth, Ruth.

1298
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,800
The next record goes out
to Radio Raheem.

1299
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,400
We love you, brother.
