00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:28,558  X1:234 X2:483 Y1:376 Y2:418
Is it bad tonight?

2
00:02:28,627 --> 00:02:31,926  X1:118 X2:601 Y1:376 Y2:418
Bad. That`s one way to describe it.

3
00:02:33,131 --> 00:02:36,123  X1:090 X2:627 Y1:376 Y2:418
Insane seems a IittIe more appropriate.

4
00:02:36,468 --> 00:02:38,902  X1:076 X2:642 Y1:376 Y2:418
It feeIs Iike he`s breathing down my neck.

5
00:02:39,638 --> 00:02:43,972  X1:080 X2:637 Y1:342 Y2:418
It is my professionaI opinion
we shouId get the heII out of here. Now.

6
00:02:44,576 --> 00:02:45,838  X1:302 X2:416 Y1:376 Y2:413
Noted.

7
00:02:47,212 --> 00:02:49,874  X1:065 X2:653 Y1:376 Y2:418
CIean this pIace up, then Iocate our guests.

8
00:02:57,756 --> 00:02:59,747  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:376 Y2:418
I just need to take the edge off.

9
00:03:00,492 --> 00:03:04,155  X1:187 X2:530 Y1:342 Y2:418
You know the routine.
I need you cIear-headed.

10
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:06,764  X1:237 X2:482 Y1:376 Y2:418
First things first.

11
00:03:09,634 --> 00:03:12,125  X1:226 X2:492 Y1:376 Y2:416
Now, where is he?

12
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,069  X1:162 X2:556 Y1:376 Y2:418
Show me where he`s hiding.

13
00:03:33,091 --> 00:03:35,616  X1:115 X2:601 Y1:342 Y2:418
Son of a bitch!
You said he onIy kiIIed nine peopIe.

14
00:03:35,694 --> 00:03:37,252  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:376 Y2:413
There are 40 victims here.

15
00:03:37,329 --> 00:03:40,457  X1:161 X2:557 Y1:342 Y2:413
Nine when he was aIive.
He`s added a few since then.

16
00:03:40,532 --> 00:03:42,500  X1:178 X2:540 Y1:376 Y2:416
Now where is he, Dennis?

17
00:03:53,278 --> 00:03:55,678  X1:078 X2:637 Y1:376 Y2:418
AII teams go to aIpha. Bring in the cube!

18
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:03,043  X1:111 X2:607 Y1:342 Y2:413
How did this guy get the name
``The Breaker``? Is he a truck driver?

19
00:04:03,388 --> 00:04:07,552  X1:100 X2:618 Y1:342 Y2:418
SimpIe foIkIore.
The IocaI coIor exorcising its demons.

20
00:04:07,893 --> 00:04:11,385  X1:086 X2:632 Y1:342 Y2:418
Maybe it`s because he broke his victims
into as many pieces as possibIe.

21
00:04:14,399 --> 00:04:16,890  X1:216 X2:501 Y1:376 Y2:418
I hate being rushed.

22
00:04:17,169 --> 00:04:18,932  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:376 Y2:413
This one isn`t Iike the others.

23
00:04:19,004 --> 00:04:21,871  X1:113 X2:604 Y1:342 Y2:418
-I`II give you a bonus.
-You don`t have that kind of money.

24
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:24,807  X1:133 X2:584 Y1:342 Y2:418
After tonight you`II be surprised.
Now, get to work.

25
00:04:32,217 --> 00:04:33,707  X1:242 X2:475 Y1:376 Y2:416
CarefuI, Dennis.

26
00:04:34,586 --> 00:04:37,248  X1:205 X2:514 Y1:376 Y2:418
Don`t get too curious.

27
00:04:40,258 --> 00:04:41,816  X1:249 X2:466 Y1:376 Y2:413
Son of a bitch!

28
00:04:42,761 --> 00:04:46,754  X1:093 X2:626 Y1:342 Y2:418
How can you justify what you`re doing,
Cyrus? It`s out and out sIavery!

29
00:04:47,032 --> 00:04:50,695  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:342 Y2:418
You are persistent, Damon.
And what about you, KaIina?

30
00:04:50,936 --> 00:04:54,667  X1:119 X2:598 Y1:342 Y2:418
StiII carrying around
those ridicuIous quicksiIver fIares?

31
00:04:54,739 --> 00:04:56,866  X1:083 X2:634 Y1:376 Y2:418
You stiII have that quaint magicaI book?

32
00:04:56,942 --> 00:05:00,434  X1:097 X2:622 Y1:342 Y2:418
These aren`t animaIs you`re capturing,
they`re human beings.

33
00:05:00,645 --> 00:05:02,237  X1:155 X2:562 Y1:376 Y2:418
They are dead human beings.

34
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:06,282  X1:115 X2:603 Y1:342 Y2:413
Maybe you shouId join Greenpeace.
Throw bIood on oId women`s furs.

35
00:05:08,453 --> 00:05:10,148  X1:178 X2:540 Y1:376 Y2:418
Who are you to pIay God?

36
00:05:12,123 --> 00:05:14,990  X1:196 X2:522 Y1:342 Y2:418
-PIaying is for chiIdren.
-You`II never puII it off.

37
00:05:15,627 --> 00:05:19,393  X1:145 X2:572 Y1:342 Y2:418
Not without the right speIIs.
That, and the thirteenth ghost.

38
00:05:19,631 --> 00:05:20,893  X1:229 X2:488 Y1:376 Y2:418
Thirteenth ghost?

39
00:05:20,966 --> 00:05:24,800  X1:100 X2:617 Y1:342 Y2:418
Get them out of my sight!
We`ve wasted too much time aIready.

40
00:05:25,804 --> 00:05:27,567  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:376 Y2:418
Why did he say thirteenth?

41
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:30,004  X1:159 X2:558 Y1:376 Y2:418
Move the cube into position.

42
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:32,400  X1:113 X2:604 Y1:376 Y2:418
What`s he taIking about, 13 ghosts?

43
00:05:32,477 --> 00:05:36,140  X1:127 X2:588 Y1:342 Y2:413
You contracted me for 12 ghosts!
The Breaker is 12!

44
00:05:36,381 --> 00:05:38,406  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:376 Y2:418
I`m done after tonight, Cyrus.

45
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:42,782  X1:132 X2:584 Y1:342 Y2:418
Yes. TweIve and then one more.
I thought you were psychic!

46
00:05:42,888 --> 00:05:44,981  X1:074 X2:642 Y1:376 Y2:418
That`s not how it works, and you know it!

47
00:05:45,056 --> 00:05:46,887  X1:182 X2:536 Y1:376 Y2:418
There`s no time to argue.

48
00:05:47,726 --> 00:05:49,387  X1:235 X2:481 Y1:376 Y2:413
ReIease the bait!

49
00:05:49,494 --> 00:05:52,463  X1:076 X2:640 Y1:376 Y2:413
What bait? We never needed bait before!

50
00:06:05,243 --> 00:06:09,009  X1:155 X2:561 Y1:342 Y2:418
A truck fuII of bIood?
You`ve got to be shitting me.

51
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:13,744  X1:291 X2:427 Y1:376 Y2:418
Oh, boy.

52
00:06:18,857 --> 00:06:20,119  X1:304 X2:415 Y1:376 Y2:413
Now...

53
00:06:20,892 --> 00:06:22,723  X1:209 X2:509 Y1:376 Y2:418
...power up the cube.

54
00:06:30,001 --> 00:06:31,491  X1:222 X2:495 Y1:376 Y2:418
Start transmitting.

55
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,231  X1:303 X2:414 Y1:376 Y2:413
Come.

56
00:07:04,803 --> 00:07:06,293  X1:303 X2:414 Y1:376 Y2:413
Come.

57
00:07:06,805 --> 00:07:08,136  X1:302 X2:414 Y1:376 Y2:413
Come!

58
00:07:15,914 --> 00:07:19,247  X1:220 X2:496 Y1:376 Y2:418
HeIp me! HeIp me!

59
00:07:24,856 --> 00:07:26,187  X1:288 X2:427 Y1:376 Y2:416
Oh, shit!

60
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:33,382  X1:250 X2:466 Y1:376 Y2:413
Put him down!

61
00:08:47,405 --> 00:08:51,341  X1:158 X2:558 Y1:342 Y2:418
Cyrus, I hope you`re happy.
You`ve got your tweIve now.

62
00:08:51,576 --> 00:08:54,101  X1:206 X2:510 Y1:376 Y2:418
HeIp me! He`s dying!

63
00:08:54,579 --> 00:08:57,776  X1:121 X2:595 Y1:342 Y2:418
Hang on, Damon. Somebody heIp!
Damn you, Cyrus!

64
00:08:58,316 --> 00:09:00,477  X1:165 X2:550 Y1:376 Y2:418
Somebody heIp me, pIease!

65
00:09:01,953 --> 00:09:04,183  X1:185 X2:532 Y1:376 Y2:418
HeIp me. Do something!

66
00:09:12,831 --> 00:09:14,526  X1:277 X2:440 Y1:376 Y2:418
Oh, Cyrus.

67
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,431  X1:288 X2:429 Y1:376 Y2:416
Oh, God.

68
00:09:26,578 --> 00:09:28,443  X1:231 X2:487 Y1:342 Y2:418
-Swing me!
-Come on, Bobby.

69
00:09:28,813 --> 00:09:30,804  X1:255 X2:463 Y1:376 Y2:418
Faster, Kathy.

70
00:09:30,949 --> 00:09:32,473  X1:202 X2:516 Y1:376 Y2:418
Let me get your arms.

71
00:09:32,617 --> 00:09:34,278  X1:248 X2:473 Y1:376 Y2:418
Try to drag me.

72
00:09:34,452 --> 00:09:38,650  X1:157 X2:562 Y1:342 Y2:418
You`re the best little brother.
l love you. Let`s go!

73
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:42,282  X1:065 X2:653 Y1:376 Y2:418
l`m going to get you! l`m going to get you!

74
00:09:44,295 --> 00:09:47,594  X1:127 X2:592 Y1:342 Y2:418
Look at those two. She`s got him
on the run now, but pretty soon...

75
00:09:47,665 --> 00:09:51,101  X1:115 X2:604 Y1:342 Y2:418
...he`s going to be picking her up
and throwing her over his shoulder.

76
00:09:51,703 --> 00:09:53,364  X1:246 X2:474 Y1:376 Y2:418
They`re perfect.

77
00:09:53,872 --> 00:09:56,067  X1:174 X2:546 Y1:376 Y2:413
Watch them. Watch them.

78
00:09:57,942 --> 00:10:00,069  X1:175 X2:546 Y1:376 Y2:418
They really love this place.

79
00:10:07,785 --> 00:10:09,309  X1:278 X2:440 Y1:376 Y2:418
l love you.

80
00:10:09,454 --> 00:10:11,115  X1:285 X2:434 Y1:376 Y2:418
Surprise!

81
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:14,815  X1:209 X2:509 Y1:376 Y2:418
My heart! My heart!

82
00:10:14,893 --> 00:10:16,724  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:068 Y2:110
Happy birthday, Dad!

83
00:10:18,296 --> 00:10:19,957  X1:193 X2:526 Y1:376 Y2:418
Happy birthday, Arthur.

84
00:10:20,098 --> 00:10:21,793  X1:191 X2:528 Y1:376 Y2:418
Here`s my present, Dad.

85
00:10:21,866 --> 00:10:24,699  X1:171 X2:549 Y1:342 Y2:413
We love you. Make a wish.
Blow out the candles.

86
00:10:26,571 --> 00:10:28,232  X1:198 X2:525 Y1:376 Y2:418
What did you wish for?

87
00:10:28,473 --> 00:10:30,805  X1:245 X2:474 Y1:342 Y2:418
-l love you.
-l love you, too.

88
00:10:36,314 --> 00:10:38,976  X1:074 X2:649 Y1:376 Y2:418
What`s that? Why is the smoke alarm on?

89
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:41,610  X1:078 X2:640 Y1:376 Y2:418
l`ll get the kids. Call the fire department.

90
00:10:41,686 --> 00:10:43,381  X1:231 X2:488 Y1:376 Y2:418
Dad! Help, Mom!

91
00:10:43,655 --> 00:10:46,624  X1:171 X2:549 Y1:376 Y2:413
Get the kids. Get the kids!

92
00:10:46,925 --> 00:10:49,325  X1:201 X2:518 Y1:376 Y2:418
Mom! Dad! Help me!

93
00:10:49,994 --> 00:10:51,928  X1:120 X2:603 Y1:376 Y2:418
Where`s your mom? Where is she?

94
00:10:51,996 --> 00:10:53,486  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:376 Y2:413
l don`t know where Mom is.

95
00:10:53,731 --> 00:10:56,427  X1:082 X2:638 Y1:376 Y2:418
Bobby, we have to get out. Oh, my God!

96
00:10:56,501 --> 00:10:57,991  X1:264 X2:454 Y1:376 Y2:413
Jean! Jean!

97
00:10:58,336 --> 00:11:01,999  X1:185 X2:534 Y1:342 Y2:413
Mom`s still in the house.
We can`t leave her there.

98
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:05,332  X1:110 X2:608 Y1:376 Y2:418
Bobby, go outside. Go wait outside.

99
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:07,742  X1:149 X2:570 Y1:376 Y2:418
You can`t go back in there, sir.

100
00:11:15,186 --> 00:11:18,019  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:376 Y2:418
l`m sorry, sir. She didn`t make it.

101
00:11:18,356 --> 00:11:20,517  X1:169 X2:548 Y1:376 Y2:418
l should have gone back in.

102
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:27,955  X1:164 X2:558 Y1:342 Y2:418
We are gathered here today,
to honor the memory...

103
00:11:28,032 --> 00:11:30,432  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:376 Y2:413
...and life`s work ofJean Kriticos...

104
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:34,067  X1:104 X2:614 Y1:376 Y2:418
...a devoted mother and loving wife...

105
00:11:34,405 --> 00:11:37,067  X1:069 X2:649 Y1:376 Y2:418
...who was too quickly taken from this life.

106
00:11:37,609 --> 00:11:42,444  X1:131 X2:587 Y1:342 Y2:418
Jean, you will be forever missed,
but never forgotten.

107
00:11:43,881 --> 00:11:45,872  X1:233 X2:484 Y1:376 Y2:418

108
00:11:46,117 --> 00:11:48,415  X1:151 X2:572 Y1:376 Y2:418
Why did you have to leave us?

109
00:11:50,288 --> 00:11:52,119  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:376 Y2:418
l can`t do this without you.

110
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:53,851  X1:198 X2:520 Y1:376 Y2:418

111
00:11:53,925 --> 00:11:56,257  X1:178 X2:539 Y1:376 Y2:418
Mom, l love you so much.

112
00:11:56,861 --> 00:11:58,886  X1:205 X2:514 Y1:376 Y2:413
Please watch over us.

113
00:12:00,798 --> 00:12:02,789  X1:217 X2:500 Y1:376 Y2:418
l`ll love you always.

114
00:12:13,278 --> 00:12:14,711  X1:276 X2:442 Y1:376 Y2:416
Dad, it`s....

115
00:12:15,813 --> 00:12:20,273  X1:075 X2:643 Y1:342 Y2:418
It`s aImost 8:30.
Shake a Ieg or you`II miss your first cIass.

116
00:12:20,618 --> 00:12:23,985  X1:166 X2:552 Y1:342 Y2:413
Today on Death in America:
``Cancer rates are down...

117
00:12:24,055 --> 00:12:26,216  X1:178 X2:540 Y1:376 Y2:418
``...but suicide is sky-high.

118
00:12:26,424 --> 00:12:28,585  X1:094 X2:625 Y1:376 Y2:418
``We have a speciaI treat for you today.

119
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:31,925  X1:133 X2:587 Y1:342 Y2:418
``A body was found this morning,
decoIopoIated.``

120
00:12:33,131 --> 00:12:35,031  X1:251 X2:468 Y1:376 Y2:418
``Decapitated.``

121
00:12:35,466 --> 00:12:37,161  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:376 Y2:418
Bobby, find a heaIthier hobby.

122
00:12:37,235 --> 00:12:39,726  X1:081 X2:637 Y1:376 Y2:418
Leave me aIone, you guys, I`m recording.

123
00:12:40,171 --> 00:12:42,162  X1:173 X2:544 Y1:376 Y2:418
Good morning, everybody.

124
00:12:42,507 --> 00:12:45,442  X1:149 X2:568 Y1:376 Y2:418
Something smeIIs interesting.

125
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:48,843  X1:103 X2:616 Y1:342 Y2:413
Dad, they found a guy without a head
behind Dunkin` Donuts.

126
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,548  X1:203 X2:515 Y1:376 Y2:413
I Iove Dunkin` Donuts.

127
00:12:52,884 --> 00:12:54,044  X1:304 X2:415 Y1:376 Y2:418
Kathy.

128
00:12:54,719 --> 00:12:58,883  X1:109 X2:609 Y1:342 Y2:418
Let Maggie make breakfast for once.
That`s why we hired her.

129
00:12:59,023 --> 00:13:01,116  X1:086 X2:633 Y1:376 Y2:418
Dad, have you tasted Maggie`s cooking?

130
00:13:01,192 --> 00:13:03,092  X1:220 X2:497 Y1:376 Y2:413
Just that one time.

131
00:13:03,161 --> 00:13:06,324  X1:078 X2:640 Y1:376 Y2:418
I heard that. HeII, I cook better than you.

132
00:13:06,464 --> 00:13:08,364  X1:131 X2:587 Y1:376 Y2:418
We have to try to get aIong here.

133
00:13:10,635 --> 00:13:14,469  X1:163 X2:555 Y1:342 Y2:418
Dad, teII Kathy that keeping
a record of death is heaIthy.

134
00:13:14,872 --> 00:13:17,705  X1:127 X2:592 Y1:342 Y2:418
Kathy, ``Keeping a record of death
is heaIthy.``

135
00:13:17,809 --> 00:13:20,039  X1:088 X2:630 Y1:376 Y2:418
Because she`s being a reaI sIut about it.

136
00:13:20,111 --> 00:13:23,274  X1:114 X2:604 Y1:376 Y2:418
Bobby. Don`t caII your sister a sIut.

137
00:13:23,548 --> 00:13:24,845  X1:218 X2:499 Y1:376 Y2:418
Thank you, Maggie.

138
00:13:25,149 --> 00:13:27,208  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:376 Y2:418
I prefer the term ``bitch.``

139
00:13:28,386 --> 00:13:29,717  X1:173 X2:545 Y1:376 Y2:418
SIuts are girIs with Ioose--

140
00:13:29,787 --> 00:13:32,051  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:342 Y2:418
Mr. Edgar AIIan Poe,
did you do your homework?

141
00:13:32,123 --> 00:13:34,421  X1:196 X2:524 Y1:376 Y2:413
Because Mr. Peterson--

142
00:13:35,093 --> 00:13:39,553  X1:102 X2:618 Y1:342 Y2:418
Damn it! Bobby, that`s the third time
I`ve tripped on that stupid scooter!

143
00:13:39,664 --> 00:13:42,224  X1:090 X2:629 Y1:342 Y2:418
-Sorry.
-If we had a bigger pIace, we wouIdn`t--

144
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,598  X1:064 X2:653 Y1:376 Y2:418
We don`t have a big pIace anymore, do we?

145
00:13:44,669 --> 00:13:46,500  X1:147 X2:570 Y1:376 Y2:413
It`s the best I can do for now...

146
00:13:46,571 --> 00:13:50,234  X1:129 X2:591 Y1:342 Y2:413
...so Iet`s aII try and keep our shit
off the fIoor.

147
00:13:50,842 --> 00:13:54,107  X1:125 X2:593 Y1:342 Y2:418
AII right? Now, Bobby,
put away the damn tape recorder.

148
00:13:54,178 --> 00:13:56,646  X1:181 X2:536 Y1:342 Y2:418
Can you do that for me?
And get ready for schooI.

149
00:13:57,382 --> 00:13:59,043  X1:250 X2:468 Y1:376 Y2:418
I`m sorry, Dad.

150
00:14:02,754 --> 00:14:04,346  X1:156 X2:562 Y1:376 Y2:418
Must be the Iawyer. I forgot.

151
00:14:04,422 --> 00:14:07,357  X1:157 X2:562 Y1:342 Y2:418
Lawyer? I thought our credit
was aII cIeaned up.

152
00:14:07,525 --> 00:14:09,516  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:376 Y2:416
No, I don`t think it`s about that.

153
00:14:11,162 --> 00:14:14,063  X1:065 X2:652 Y1:376 Y2:418
They won`t make us move again, wiII they?

154
00:14:14,132 --> 00:14:17,124  X1:134 X2:584 Y1:342 Y2:416
It`s gonna be aII right.
Whatever it is, we`II deaI with it.

155
00:14:18,703 --> 00:14:19,727  X1:261 X2:456 Y1:376 Y2:413
Mr. Kriticos?

156
00:14:19,804 --> 00:14:21,396  X1:201 X2:516 Y1:376 Y2:418
That`s right. You are?

157
00:14:21,506 --> 00:14:23,474  X1:167 X2:552 Y1:376 Y2:418
Ben Moss. How do you do?

158
00:14:23,608 --> 00:14:24,905  X1:241 X2:478 Y1:376 Y2:416
PIease, come in.

159
00:14:24,976 --> 00:14:27,444  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:376 Y2:418
Is now a good time, or...?

160
00:14:27,578 --> 00:14:32,311  X1:135 X2:583 Y1:342 Y2:418
As good a time as any.
PIease, just give me one minute.

161
00:14:36,053 --> 00:14:37,918  X1:233 X2:485 Y1:376 Y2:418
Sorry. I`m ready.

162
00:14:38,122 --> 00:14:41,717  X1:117 X2:602 Y1:342 Y2:418
I represent the estate of your uncIe
Cyrus Kriticos.

163
00:14:41,859 --> 00:14:43,486  X1:181 X2:536 Y1:376 Y2:418
We have an UncIe Cyrus?

164
00:14:43,995 --> 00:14:48,159  X1:100 X2:620 Y1:342 Y2:413
Had. I onIy met him a coupIe of times
as a kid.

165
00:14:48,299 --> 00:14:49,891  X1:199 X2:520 Y1:376 Y2:418
He wasn`t too popuIar.

166
00:14:50,334 --> 00:14:52,666  X1:127 X2:592 Y1:342 Y2:418
My dad said
he squandered the famiIy fortune.

167
00:14:52,804 --> 00:14:54,396  X1:176 X2:542 Y1:376 Y2:418
We have a famiIy fortune?

168
00:14:54,472 --> 00:14:56,940  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:376 Y2:418
No. Cyrus squandered it.

169
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:59,566  X1:193 X2:525 Y1:342 Y2:413
Bobby, isn`t that great?
You have a Iate uncIe.

170
00:14:59,644 --> 00:15:02,169  X1:214 X2:504 Y1:342 Y2:418
-What is he Iate for?
-His next birthday.

171
00:15:02,246 --> 00:15:03,907  X1:203 X2:514 Y1:376 Y2:416
You mean, he`s dead?

172
00:15:04,081 --> 00:15:06,447  X1:172 X2:546 Y1:342 Y2:418
-Now we get his attention.
-Pipe down.

173
00:15:06,517 --> 00:15:08,644  X1:157 X2:562 Y1:342 Y2:418
Cyrus recorded this message
six weeks ago.

174
00:15:08,719 --> 00:15:11,711  X1:127 X2:591 Y1:342 Y2:413
He asked that it be pIayed for you
in the event of his death.

175
00:15:20,798 --> 00:15:22,095  X1:289 X2:427 Y1:376 Y2:413
Arthur...

176
00:15:23,434 --> 00:15:25,265  X1:182 X2:536 Y1:376 Y2:418
...it`s good to talk to you.

177
00:15:25,603 --> 00:15:29,334  X1:075 X2:643 Y1:342 Y2:418
Sadly, if you`re watching this now,
it means l am no longer among the living.

178
00:15:29,841 --> 00:15:34,505  X1:084 X2:637 Y1:342 Y2:418
Happily, that makes you and your family
my sole beneficiaries.

179
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:37,011  X1:100 X2:618 Y1:376 Y2:418
l`ve instructed my lawyer, Mr. Moss...

180
00:15:37,181 --> 00:15:41,811  X1:121 X2:599 Y1:342 Y2:418
...to deliver the essential elements
in my last will and testament.

181
00:15:42,253 --> 00:15:43,880  X1:211 X2:507 Y1:376 Y2:416
Give it to them, Ben.

182
00:15:49,861 --> 00:15:51,192  X1:300 X2:416 Y1:376 Y2:418
A key?

183
00:15:51,529 --> 00:15:52,860  X1:246 X2:470 Y1:376 Y2:418
A key to what?

184
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:54,825  X1:179 X2:537 Y1:376 Y2:418
A key to your new house.

185
00:15:55,066 --> 00:15:56,055  X1:303 X2:414 Y1:376 Y2:413
What?

186
00:15:56,701 --> 00:16:00,228  X1:091 X2:630 Y1:376 Y2:418
This house is the fruit of my life`s work.

187
00:16:01,873 --> 00:16:04,842  X1:117 X2:602 Y1:342 Y2:418
Bathrooms.
Everyone gets their own bathroom.

188
00:16:04,909 --> 00:16:06,001  X1:247 X2:470 Y1:376 Y2:413
Is this for reaI?

189
00:16:06,077 --> 00:16:10,173  X1:176 X2:542 Y1:342 Y2:418
lt is a one-of-a-kind home.
lt`s my home, actually.

190
00:16:12,717 --> 00:16:14,207  X1:280 X2:437 Y1:376 Y2:418
My home.

191
00:16:14,552 --> 00:16:17,953  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:342 Y2:418
l have no complaints.
l`ve led an interesting life.

192
00:16:18,389 --> 00:16:21,187  X1:126 X2:592 Y1:376 Y2:418
l have seen some amazing things.

193
00:16:24,262 --> 00:16:28,460  X1:082 X2:636 Y1:342 Y2:418
But the only regret l have, is that
l never got to know my nephew Arthur...

194
00:16:28,933 --> 00:16:32,528  X1:108 X2:612 Y1:342 Y2:418
...nor appreciate the love of a family,
like you have.

195
00:16:32,737 --> 00:16:36,696  X1:183 X2:541 Y1:342 Y2:418
This house is my attempt
to make up for that.

196
00:16:38,075 --> 00:16:39,406  X1:306 X2:413 Y1:376 Y2:418
Enjoy.

197
00:16:42,647 --> 00:16:44,171  X1:171 X2:547 Y1:376 Y2:418
Perhaps we`ll meet again...

198
00:16:45,917 --> 00:16:47,407  X1:239 X2:479 Y1:376 Y2:413
...in another life.

199
00:16:51,422 --> 00:16:53,413  X1:207 X2:510 Y1:342 Y2:413
-Wow!
-When can we see it?

200
00:16:53,624 --> 00:16:56,991  X1:098 X2:620 Y1:342 Y2:418
The house is yours whenever you Iike.
I`m heading up there after work.

201
00:16:57,061 --> 00:16:59,859  X1:105 X2:614 Y1:376 Y2:418
If you want, you, your wife and kids--

202
00:16:59,931 --> 00:17:02,126  X1:110 X2:608 Y1:376 Y2:413
Time-out. I am not the missus here.

203
00:17:02,199 --> 00:17:04,360  X1:277 X2:441 Y1:376 Y2:418
My wife....

204
00:17:04,802 --> 00:17:06,201  X1:262 X2:456 Y1:376 Y2:418
My wife is....

205
00:17:06,537 --> 00:17:09,062  X1:094 X2:623 Y1:376 Y2:418
Our mom got burned to death in a fire.

206
00:17:09,507 --> 00:17:11,134  X1:241 X2:477 Y1:376 Y2:413
What? It`s true.

207
00:17:11,509 --> 00:17:12,498  X1:198 X2:520 Y1:376 Y2:418
That`s enough, Robert.

208
00:17:13,945 --> 00:17:18,279  X1:097 X2:621 Y1:376 Y2:418
Mr. Moss, exactIy where is this pIace?

209
00:17:18,983 --> 00:17:22,146  X1:139 X2:578 Y1:342 Y2:413
A couple hours drive from here,
a town called Willow Grove...

210
00:17:22,219 --> 00:17:23,709  X1:201 X2:518 Y1:376 Y2:418
...just up the parkway.

211
00:17:23,788 --> 00:17:27,884  X1:090 X2:628 Y1:342 Y2:418
lt`s in a gorgeous area. But l warn you,
your uncle liked his privacy.

212
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:30,291  X1:141 X2:579 Y1:376 Y2:418
There isn`t a neighbor for miles.

213
00:17:30,428 --> 00:17:31,656  X1:215 X2:502 Y1:376 Y2:418
Come on. Hurry up.

214
00:17:31,729 --> 00:17:34,630  X1:305 X2:413 Y1:376 Y2:413
S-U-F.

215
00:17:35,066 --> 00:17:37,728  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:376 Y2:418
Suffocate. I got it. I win.

216
00:17:37,802 --> 00:17:40,464  X1:113 X2:604 Y1:376 Y2:418
So what? You think you`re so sIick.

217
00:17:40,705 --> 00:17:43,196  X1:082 X2:636 Y1:376 Y2:418
Come on, you guys. We`re aImost there.

218
00:17:45,209 --> 00:17:49,168  X1:068 X2:650 Y1:342 Y2:413
-Excited?
-Yeah. Mom wouId have freaked over this.

219
00:17:51,649 --> 00:17:55,415  X1:161 X2:556 Y1:342 Y2:418
Looks Iike things are
starting to get better, right?

220
00:17:55,686 --> 00:17:56,778  X1:307 X2:409 Y1:376 Y2:413
Yeah.

221
00:19:20,838 --> 00:19:22,328  X1:248 X2:470 Y1:376 Y2:418
That`s strange.

222
00:19:25,242 --> 00:19:27,733  X1:227 X2:491 Y1:376 Y2:416
Dad, it`s beautifuI.

223
00:19:29,013 --> 00:19:33,109  X1:081 X2:637 Y1:376 Y2:418
My God. I`ve never seen anything Iike it.

224
00:19:35,586 --> 00:19:36,985  X1:310 X2:406 Y1:376 Y2:413
CooI!

225
00:19:37,688 --> 00:19:39,679  X1:269 X2:449 Y1:376 Y2:413
So futuroic.

226
00:19:47,331 --> 00:19:50,061  X1:101 X2:616 Y1:342 Y2:418
It`s about time somebody showed up.
Is this your pIace?

227
00:19:50,134 --> 00:19:52,625  X1:219 X2:499 Y1:342 Y2:418
-Who are you?
-I`m the power guy.

228
00:19:54,505 --> 00:19:55,836  X1:266 X2:452 Y1:376 Y2:413
Don`t touch.

229
00:19:56,073 --> 00:20:00,373  X1:098 X2:619 Y1:342 Y2:418
Your house is knocking out the power
of the whoIe tri-quad area.

230
00:20:00,444 --> 00:20:02,605  X1:191 X2:527 Y1:342 Y2:413
I need to get inside
and check the breakers.

231
00:20:02,947 --> 00:20:05,575  X1:131 X2:586 Y1:342 Y2:418
CouId you come back tomorrow?
Is that a possibiIity?

232
00:20:05,649 --> 00:20:07,310  X1:188 X2:530 Y1:376 Y2:413
Tomorrow? Let me see.

233
00:20:07,384 --> 00:20:11,013  X1:088 X2:631 Y1:342 Y2:418
There are about 5,570 houses right now
without power.

234
00:20:11,088 --> 00:20:13,147  X1:097 X2:621 Y1:376 Y2:418
My bosses kind of frown on that, so....

235
00:20:13,224 --> 00:20:16,159  X1:083 X2:635 Y1:376 Y2:418
WeII, that`s not reaIIy our probIem, is it?

236
00:20:18,596 --> 00:20:21,463  X1:109 X2:611 Y1:342 Y2:413
Look, buddy, I`ve been doing this job
for about three weeks.

237
00:20:21,532 --> 00:20:24,000  X1:147 X2:569 Y1:342 Y2:418
Is there any way
you can give me a break here?

238
00:20:24,135 --> 00:20:25,295  X1:310 X2:407 Y1:376 Y2:413
Sure.

239
00:20:25,369 --> 00:20:26,927  X1:266 X2:453 Y1:376 Y2:418
No probIem.

240
00:20:28,239 --> 00:20:29,729  X1:274 X2:444 Y1:376 Y2:418
Thank you.

241
00:20:30,574 --> 00:20:31,768  X1:307 X2:410 Y1:376 Y2:413
Mr...?

242
00:20:31,842 --> 00:20:33,901  X1:183 X2:535 Y1:376 Y2:413
Kriticos. Arthur Kriticos.

243
00:20:35,813 --> 00:20:37,542  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:376 Y2:418
It`s quite a pIace you`ve got.

244
00:20:38,215 --> 00:20:40,513  X1:190 X2:526 Y1:376 Y2:418
Yeah. We`re moving in.

245
00:20:40,718 --> 00:20:42,481  X1:221 X2:497 Y1:376 Y2:418
One step at a time.

246
00:21:00,704 --> 00:21:03,366  X1:225 X2:492 Y1:342 Y2:418
-That`s odd.
-Dad, you broke it.

247
00:21:03,641 --> 00:21:05,268  X1:211 X2:507 Y1:376 Y2:418
Bobby, give it a rest.

248
00:21:10,414 --> 00:21:11,847  X1:308 X2:410 Y1:376 Y2:413
HeIIo.

249
00:21:12,683 --> 00:21:15,345  X1:113 X2:604 Y1:376 Y2:418
Wow! You can see right through it.

250
00:21:16,554 --> 00:21:18,545  X1:114 X2:603 Y1:376 Y2:418
You guys couIdn`t afford any waIIs?

251
00:21:18,722 --> 00:21:20,189  X1:272 X2:447 Y1:376 Y2:413
How weird.

252
00:21:20,324 --> 00:21:23,316  X1:116 X2:602 Y1:342 Y2:418
Guess UncIe Cyrus wasn`t too keen
on privacy.

253
00:21:24,128 --> 00:21:27,120  X1:090 X2:628 Y1:376 Y2:418
I hope the bathroom`s in the basement.

254
00:22:08,806 --> 00:22:10,637  X1:219 X2:499 Y1:376 Y2:413
It`s Iike a funhouse.

255
00:22:12,576 --> 00:22:14,066  X1:284 X2:434 Y1:376 Y2:413
It`s Latin.

256
00:22:25,022 --> 00:22:26,922  X1:181 X2:537 Y1:376 Y2:418
Everything`s so beautifuI.

257
00:22:29,193 --> 00:22:33,562  X1:116 X2:601 Y1:342 Y2:418
FamiIy, just so we`re aII cIear,
Miss Maggie does not do windows.

258
00:22:33,764 --> 00:22:35,061  X1:306 X2:409 Y1:376 Y2:413
Wow!

259
00:22:41,405 --> 00:22:44,033  X1:081 X2:637 Y1:376 Y2:418
What an incredibIe weaIth of knowIedge.

260
00:22:47,578 --> 00:22:49,409  X1:230 X2:487 Y1:376 Y2:413
A samurai sword.

261
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,641  X1:216 X2:502 Y1:376 Y2:418
In your dreams, paI.

262
00:22:54,852 --> 00:22:57,446  X1:089 X2:630 Y1:376 Y2:416
Dad, this stuff must be worth a fortune.

263
00:22:57,521 --> 00:23:00,183  X1:141 X2:575 Y1:376 Y2:416
Yeah, that occurred to me, too.

264
00:23:08,666 --> 00:23:10,429  X1:277 X2:440 Y1:376 Y2:418
Oh, Cyrus.

265
00:23:10,701 --> 00:23:14,193  X1:069 X2:647 Y1:376 Y2:418
You crazy son of a bitch, what did you do?

266
00:23:30,921 --> 00:23:32,149  X1:277 X2:441 Y1:376 Y2:413
Goodness.

267
00:23:32,523 --> 00:23:34,514  X1:217 X2:500 Y1:376 Y2:413
It`s Iike a cathedraI.

268
00:23:35,826 --> 00:23:39,262  X1:084 X2:633 Y1:376 Y2:418
AII right, first ruIe: No throwing stones.

269
00:23:40,531 --> 00:23:42,431  X1:143 X2:575 Y1:376 Y2:418
It`s marveIous, though, isn`t it?

270
00:23:43,801 --> 00:23:45,291  X1:215 X2:502 Y1:376 Y2:418
A Iiving work of art.

271
00:23:50,374 --> 00:23:52,968  X1:147 X2:569 Y1:342 Y2:418
The sooner you show me
where you hid the basement...

272
00:23:53,043 --> 00:23:55,443  X1:077 X2:642 Y1:376 Y2:418
...the sooner I can get my ass out of here.

273
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,449  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:342 Y2:418
I beIieve it`s down the haII.
It`s two doors on the right.

274
00:24:03,654 --> 00:24:05,121  X1:272 X2:446 Y1:376 Y2:413
Excuse me.

275
00:24:09,793 --> 00:24:12,489  X1:158 X2:560 Y1:376 Y2:418
The construction is amazing.

276
00:24:14,999 --> 00:24:16,557  X1:232 X2:485 Y1:376 Y2:418
I`m getting dizzy.

277
00:24:20,504 --> 00:24:21,801  X1:301 X2:418 Y1:376 Y2:418
Bobby.

278
00:24:21,905 --> 00:24:25,568  X1:158 X2:560 Y1:376 Y2:418
Don`t touch anything. Okay?

279
00:24:27,478 --> 00:24:29,776  X1:081 X2:635 Y1:376 Y2:418
At Ieast untiI we get property insurance.

280
00:24:30,581 --> 00:24:33,141  X1:095 X2:622 Y1:342 Y2:418
Arthur, we`ve got some papers to sign
in the Iibrary.

281
00:24:33,217 --> 00:24:36,653  X1:113 X2:604 Y1:342 Y2:418
After that, I`d Iove to give you
and your famiIy a tour of the house.

282
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,156  X1:100 X2:619 Y1:342 Y2:418
Great. I don`t want you guys to move
from this spot.

283
00:24:40,224 --> 00:24:41,452  X1:220 X2:498 Y1:376 Y2:418
We`II be right back.

284
00:24:41,525 --> 00:24:44,187  X1:072 X2:645 Y1:376 Y2:418
You`re being paranoid and overprotective.

285
00:24:44,328 --> 00:24:46,660  X1:205 X2:511 Y1:376 Y2:416
Yeah, of aII this stuff.

286
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:49,358  X1:129 X2:588 Y1:376 Y2:418
I know you guys too weII. Stay...

287
00:24:49,967 --> 00:24:53,164  X1:197 X2:522 Y1:376 Y2:418
...right here. I mean it.

288
00:25:16,593 --> 00:25:18,083  X1:266 X2:451 Y1:376 Y2:413
What the...?

289
00:25:36,113 --> 00:25:38,104  X1:085 X2:633 Y1:376 Y2:418
Where`d you hide your money, oId man?

290
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:54,591  X1:312 X2:403 Y1:376 Y2:413
Shit!

291
00:25:55,766 --> 00:25:57,597  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:376 Y2:413
What the heII was that?

292
00:26:04,775 --> 00:26:06,106  X1:298 X2:419 Y1:376 Y2:416
Oh, no.

293
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:07,970  X1:277 X2:440 Y1:376 Y2:418
Oh, Cyrus.

294
00:26:11,482 --> 00:26:14,315  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:376 Y2:418
Now I know I`m dreaming.

295
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,110  X1:211 X2:507 Y1:376 Y2:418
Was Cyrus a hunter?

296
00:26:18,455 --> 00:26:19,683  X1:219 X2:498 Y1:376 Y2:418
You couId say that.

297
00:26:20,057 --> 00:26:23,549  X1:135 X2:582 Y1:342 Y2:418
Your uncIe was quite a coIIector
of many things.

298
00:26:32,236 --> 00:26:35,103  X1:135 X2:581 Y1:342 Y2:418
I`ve marked where
you`re supposed to sign, Arthur.

299
00:26:35,172 --> 00:26:36,662  X1:272 X2:445 Y1:376 Y2:418
Okay, Iook.

300
00:26:37,774 --> 00:26:41,005  X1:159 X2:559 Y1:342 Y2:413
I didn`t want to bring this up
in front of the kids...

301
00:26:42,579 --> 00:26:45,980  X1:117 X2:602 Y1:376 Y2:418
...but this pIace is beyond amazing.

302
00:26:51,889 --> 00:26:53,584  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:376 Y2:418
I`m just a math teacher.

303
00:26:54,658 --> 00:26:56,888  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:376 Y2:413
The taxes aIone must be....

304
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,360  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:376 Y2:418
I have nothing set aside.

305
00:27:01,165 --> 00:27:05,295  X1:072 X2:646 Y1:376 Y2:418
To be honest, a fire took away everything.

306
00:27:05,669 --> 00:27:07,660  X1:134 X2:582 Y1:376 Y2:418
Arthur, you don`t need to worry.

307
00:27:08,639 --> 00:27:11,870  X1:177 X2:539 Y1:342 Y2:413
Cyrus was a genius
when it came to finances.

308
00:27:11,942 --> 00:27:15,878  X1:084 X2:635 Y1:342 Y2:418
BasicaIIy, you and your famiIy
never have to worry about money again.

309
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:21,447  X1:251 X2:467 Y1:376 Y2:413
Son of a bitch.

310
00:28:19,243 --> 00:28:21,370  X1:185 X2:533 Y1:376 Y2:418
Lookee here. Look, y`aII.

311
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:24,309  X1:273 X2:443 Y1:376 Y2:416
Look, Iook!

312
00:28:31,888 --> 00:28:33,219  X1:311 X2:406 Y1:376 Y2:418
Sign.

313
00:28:34,825 --> 00:28:35,985  X1:294 X2:422 Y1:376 Y2:413
Arthur?

314
00:28:38,395 --> 00:28:39,953  X1:197 X2:520 Y1:376 Y2:418
Arthur, we`ve got to....

315
00:28:40,397 --> 00:28:42,524  X1:239 X2:478 Y1:376 Y2:413
We have to taIk.

316
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:44,658  X1:114 X2:603 Y1:376 Y2:413
What is the deaI with the breakers?

317
00:28:44,735 --> 00:28:49,104  X1:149 X2:570 Y1:342 Y2:418
Nothing. I`m not a power guy.
My name is Dennis Rafkin.

318
00:28:49,172 --> 00:28:51,470  X1:199 X2:519 Y1:342 Y2:413
-You`re Dennis Rafkin?
-Who`s Dennis Rafkin?

319
00:28:51,541 --> 00:28:53,509  X1:108 X2:610 Y1:376 Y2:418
My office warned me about this guy.

320
00:28:53,577 --> 00:28:56,705  X1:090 X2:628 Y1:342 Y2:418
I know this wiII sound
compIeteIy whacked, but stay with me.

321
00:28:56,780 --> 00:29:00,910  X1:073 X2:645 Y1:342 Y2:418
I used to hunt dispIaced spirituaI energies
with your uncIe.

322
00:29:01,184 --> 00:29:02,378  X1:280 X2:438 Y1:376 Y2:418
I`m sorry?

323
00:29:02,653 --> 00:29:06,453  X1:135 X2:584 Y1:376 Y2:418
PK agents. Revenants. Wraiths.

324
00:29:07,157 --> 00:29:09,318  X1:190 X2:526 Y1:342 Y2:418
Do you have any idea
what I`m taIking about?

325
00:29:10,927 --> 00:29:13,623  X1:087 X2:630 Y1:376 Y2:418
Okay. I`II do this the easy way: ghosts.

326
00:29:14,298 --> 00:29:16,129  X1:221 X2:495 Y1:376 Y2:416
Arthur, I used to....

327
00:29:16,433 --> 00:29:19,596  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:342 Y2:418
I used to hunt ghosts
with your UncIe Cyrus.

328
00:29:21,538 --> 00:29:22,527  X1:299 X2:418 Y1:376 Y2:413
Goats?

329
00:29:22,606 --> 00:29:25,632  X1:153 X2:563 Y1:342 Y2:413
Ghosts! Ghosts, goddamn it!
Listen to me!

330
00:29:25,876 --> 00:29:27,605  X1:143 X2:575 Y1:376 Y2:418
Race you to the end of the haII.

331
00:29:27,678 --> 00:29:30,169  X1:077 X2:642 Y1:376 Y2:418
No, Bobby, I don`t think this is the pIace--

332
00:29:30,647 --> 00:29:33,673  X1:186 X2:532 Y1:342 Y2:418
Come on, sIowpoke!
Is that the best you got?

333
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:36,184  X1:106 X2:612 Y1:376 Y2:418
My grandma scoots better than that.

334
00:29:36,253 --> 00:29:41,555  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:342 Y2:418
Ghosts. As in disgruntIed spirits
trapped on earth. Ghosts.

335
00:29:41,692 --> 00:29:43,091  X1:192 X2:524 Y1:376 Y2:413
As in HaIIoween? Boo?

336
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:46,129  X1:136 X2:582 Y1:342 Y2:418
As in Demi Moore
and Unchained Melody. Ghosts.

337
00:29:46,196 --> 00:29:49,324  X1:121 X2:596 Y1:376 Y2:418
Ghosts. Okay, I get it. I`m scared.

338
00:29:49,966 --> 00:29:51,991  X1:140 X2:578 Y1:376 Y2:418
Don`t Iaugh at me. Don`t Iaugh.

339
00:29:53,036 --> 00:29:54,469  X1:193 X2:524 Y1:376 Y2:418
I`II expIain everything...

340
00:29:54,538 --> 00:29:58,133  X1:147 X2:569 Y1:344 Y2:418
...as soon as you get
you and your chiIdren outside.

341
00:29:58,208 --> 00:30:00,369  X1:165 X2:552 Y1:342 Y2:418
-What`s taking you so Iong?
-Out of my way.

342
00:30:00,444 --> 00:30:02,878  X1:111 X2:607 Y1:342 Y2:413
-I don`t think scooting is your game.
-Come on.

343
00:30:02,946 --> 00:30:06,040  X1:131 X2:586 Y1:342 Y2:418
-I won.
-You cheated. I didn`t get a start.

344
00:30:06,183 --> 00:30:07,810  X1:159 X2:559 Y1:376 Y2:418
Got to be on your toes, man.

345
00:30:07,884 --> 00:30:11,786  X1:168 X2:550 Y1:342 Y2:418
This has to be my room.
There are toys everywhere.

346
00:30:11,855 --> 00:30:15,985  X1:096 X2:621 Y1:342 Y2:413
-I wonder what my room`s Iike.
-This is the cooIest room in the house.

347
00:30:20,897 --> 00:30:22,558  X1:257 X2:461 Y1:376 Y2:413
I`II be in here.

348
00:30:37,514 --> 00:30:40,506  X1:193 X2:522 Y1:376 Y2:418
This pIace is awesome!

349
00:30:41,151 --> 00:30:44,587  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:342 Y2:413
Cyrus has containment cubes
aII over the basement.

350
00:30:44,888 --> 00:30:47,220  X1:140 X2:578 Y1:376 Y2:418
I don`t know why they`re here...

351
00:30:47,524 --> 00:30:50,220  X1:076 X2:642 Y1:376 Y2:418
...and I am not staying around to find out.

352
00:30:50,293 --> 00:30:52,784  X1:224 X2:493 Y1:342 Y2:418
-So, if I were you--
-WeII, he isn`t you.

353
00:30:53,296 --> 00:30:56,322  X1:098 X2:620 Y1:342 Y2:418
This guy has been harassing my office
since your uncIe died.

354
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,459  X1:204 X2:514 Y1:376 Y2:413
I see this aII the time.

355
00:30:58,535 --> 00:31:01,902  X1:165 X2:553 Y1:342 Y2:413
Some rich guy passes away
and aII the nuts come out!

356
00:31:02,606 --> 00:31:05,404  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:342 Y2:418
Next thing, he`II be cIaiming
Cyrus owned him money or--

357
00:31:05,475 --> 00:31:08,808  X1:128 X2:588 Y1:342 Y2:418
He did owe me money.
He owed me a shitIoad of money!

358
00:31:09,246 --> 00:31:11,544  X1:107 X2:611 Y1:376 Y2:418
These are some funky-Iooking specs.

359
00:31:13,917 --> 00:31:16,977  X1:111 X2:606 Y1:342 Y2:413
-What do you think? Do I Iook cooI?
-Let me see.

360
00:31:17,053 --> 00:31:18,918  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:376 Y2:418
Not so fast. Cater to my ego first:

361
00:31:18,989 --> 00:31:20,923  X1:154 X2:566 Y1:342 Y2:418
``Maggie`s the best babysitter
you ever had.``

362
00:31:20,991 --> 00:31:22,982  X1:277 X2:438 Y1:342 Y2:418
-Come on!
-AII right.

363
00:31:23,293 --> 00:31:25,955  X1:172 X2:544 Y1:342 Y2:418
I`m getting my ass
out of the big gIass house!

364
00:31:26,496 --> 00:31:28,930  X1:126 X2:592 Y1:376 Y2:418
Grab your chiIdren! Do the same.

365
00:31:30,834 --> 00:31:32,096  X1:232 X2:485 Y1:376 Y2:418
Are you aII right?

366
00:31:42,779 --> 00:31:44,440  X1:264 X2:454 Y1:376 Y2:413
Jean! Jean!

367
00:31:47,951 --> 00:31:49,942  X1:118 X2:600 Y1:376 Y2:418
We`II go get you some heIp. Okay?

368
00:31:50,854 --> 00:31:52,185  X1:242 X2:476 Y1:376 Y2:413
Don`t touch me.

369
00:32:01,465 --> 00:32:03,797  X1:263 X2:453 Y1:376 Y2:418
Oh, my God!

370
00:32:12,476 --> 00:32:13,841  X1:209 X2:509 Y1:376 Y2:418
We have struck goId.

371
00:32:15,111 --> 00:32:17,102  X1:301 X2:416 Y1:342 Y2:413
-Easy.
-Don`t.

372
00:32:26,756 --> 00:32:28,451  X1:231 X2:488 Y1:376 Y2:418
How`s your head?

373
00:32:29,326 --> 00:32:30,816  X1:282 X2:437 Y1:376 Y2:418
Not good.

374
00:32:32,429 --> 00:32:33,657  X1:232 X2:486 Y1:376 Y2:413
Where`s the suit?

375
00:32:46,009 --> 00:32:48,637  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:376 Y2:418
Power guy. Idiot.

376
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,645  X1:310 X2:406 Y1:376 Y2:413
CooI!

377
00:32:52,015 --> 00:32:54,313  X1:091 X2:627 Y1:376 Y2:418
Better have a pair of those in my room.

378
00:32:54,684 --> 00:32:56,208  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:376 Y2:418
Bobby, where are you going?

379
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:02,285  X1:185 X2:533 Y1:376 Y2:418
What are you staring at?

380
00:33:04,528 --> 00:33:06,086  X1:273 X2:445 Y1:376 Y2:418
Hey, kiddo.

381
00:33:07,364 --> 00:33:09,195  X1:164 X2:554 Y1:376 Y2:418
He thinks I`m going to duck.

382
00:33:10,166 --> 00:33:11,656  X1:287 X2:432 Y1:376 Y2:413
Nice tits.

383
00:33:15,038 --> 00:33:17,700  X1:173 X2:545 Y1:342 Y2:418
What`s the matter, honey?
Bad representation?

384
00:33:45,502 --> 00:33:47,367  X1:165 X2:553 Y1:376 Y2:418
Not bad for an hourIy wage.

385
00:33:58,214 --> 00:33:59,909  X1:231 X2:486 Y1:376 Y2:413
It`s time to Ieave.

386
00:34:00,216 --> 00:34:02,150  X1:187 X2:530 Y1:376 Y2:418
I`II take your word for it.

387
00:34:04,321 --> 00:34:05,185  X1:301 X2:418 Y1:376 Y2:418
Kathy?

388
00:34:12,796 --> 00:34:14,263  X1:214 X2:504 Y1:376 Y2:418
Come on. This way.

389
00:34:17,667 --> 00:34:20,966  X1:160 X2:556 Y1:376 Y2:418
Shit! What the heII? Kathy!

390
00:34:22,105 --> 00:34:25,006  X1:236 X2:480 Y1:376 Y2:418
Maggie? Bobby!

391
00:34:54,137 --> 00:34:56,765  X1:181 X2:536 Y1:376 Y2:418
I was just kidding before.

392
00:34:57,774 --> 00:34:59,332  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:376 Y2:418
A IittIe Iawyer humor.

393
00:35:35,478 --> 00:35:36,445  X1:301 X2:418 Y1:376 Y2:418
Kathy?

394
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:38,244  X1:299 X2:417 Y1:376 Y2:418
Bobby!

395
00:35:42,185 --> 00:35:43,652  X1:236 X2:482 Y1:376 Y2:413
I don`t beIieve it.

396
00:35:43,753 --> 00:35:45,084  X1:255 X2:464 Y1:376 Y2:413
BeIieve what?

397
00:35:47,757 --> 00:35:51,284  X1:120 X2:598 Y1:342 Y2:418
-I toId them not to Ieave this spot.
-They`re kids, what do you expect?

398
00:35:51,361 --> 00:35:54,922  X1:065 X2:653 Y1:342 Y2:418
Thank you, Dr. PhiI. You check downstairs.
I`II Iook up.

399
00:35:55,398 --> 00:35:57,263  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:376 Y2:418
Bobby, come on! It`s time to go!

400
00:36:06,042 --> 00:36:08,272  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:376 Y2:418
Kathy? Where are you guys?

401
00:36:08,344 --> 00:36:09,538  X1:299 X2:417 Y1:376 Y2:418
Bobby!

404
00:38:27,417 --> 00:38:30,818  X1:153 X2:564 Y1:342 Y2:418
What are you doing up here?
I toId you to wait downstairs.

405
00:38:30,887 --> 00:38:34,152  X1:146 X2:572 Y1:342 Y2:413
Dad, come on.
This bathroom is unbeIievabIe.

406
00:38:34,224 --> 00:38:37,785  X1:125 X2:593 Y1:342 Y2:418
Great house. BeautifuI bathroom.
Now, where is your brother?

407
00:38:38,361 --> 00:38:39,988  X1:229 X2:489 Y1:376 Y2:418
He`s with Maggie.

408
00:38:40,363 --> 00:38:44,493  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:342 Y2:418
Was with Maggie. We were racing
and we saw aII the gIass--

409
00:38:44,567 --> 00:38:48,560  X1:143 X2:574 Y1:342 Y2:418
You`re supposed to watch him.
That`s what I pay you for.

410
00:38:59,515 --> 00:39:00,880  X1:301 X2:418 Y1:376 Y2:418
Bobby.

412
00:39:07,423 --> 00:39:08,754  X1:290 X2:428 Y1:376 Y2:418
Maggie?

413
00:39:09,292 --> 00:39:11,089  X1:186 X2:532 Y1:376 Y2:418

414
00:39:11,427 --> 00:39:12,985  X1:268 X2:449 Y1:376 Y2:418

415
00:39:15,164 --> 00:39:16,324  X1:290 X2:428 Y1:376 Y2:418

416
00:39:16,766 --> 00:39:18,063  X1:212 X2:505 Y1:376 Y2:418
Stop pIaying games.

417
00:39:18,134 --> 00:39:22,833  X1:125 X2:593 Y1:342 Y2:413

418
00:39:24,607 --> 00:39:26,234  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:376 Y2:418
Don`t come down, Bobby.

419
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:29,100  X1:255 X2:463 Y1:376 Y2:418
Stay upstairs.

420
00:39:31,447 --> 00:39:33,108  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:376 Y2:413
Don`t follow her.

421
00:39:35,118 --> 00:39:37,109  X1:223 X2:495 Y1:376 Y2:418

422
00:39:39,789 --> 00:39:42,019  X1:181 X2:537 Y1:376 Y2:418
Bobby, don`t come down.

423
00:39:43,293 --> 00:39:46,456  X1:168 X2:550 Y1:376 Y2:418
Bobby? Around the corner.

424

425
00:39:50,199 --> 00:39:51,359  X1:290 X2:430 Y1:376 Y2:413
That`s it.

426
00:39:51,534 --> 00:39:53,399  X1:153 X2:562 Y1:376 Y2:418
You guys, I`m gonna teII Dad!

427
00:39:54,804 --> 00:39:56,135  X1:299 X2:417 Y1:376 Y2:418
Bobby!

428
00:39:58,708 --> 00:40:01,734  X1:139 X2:580 Y1:342 Y2:418
I`II find Bobby.
But I want you both out of here.

429
00:40:01,811 --> 00:40:03,244  X1:271 X2:445 Y1:342 Y2:413
-But, Dad--
-No ``buts``!

430
00:40:03,313 --> 00:40:06,908  X1:123 X2:595 Y1:342 Y2:413
I want you both to wait in the car.
I`II be out as soon as I find the kid.

431
00:40:06,983 --> 00:40:10,612  X1:106 X2:611 Y1:342 Y2:418
-Why are you freaking out?
-Just this once, don`t argue with me.

432
00:40:13,456 --> 00:40:15,048  X1:161 X2:557 Y1:376 Y2:418
What happened to the door?

433
00:40:15,491 --> 00:40:17,152  X1:249 X2:466 Y1:376 Y2:413
Son of a bitch!

434
00:40:17,493 --> 00:40:19,154  X1:210 X2:508 Y1:376 Y2:413
I cannot beIieve this.

435
00:40:19,495 --> 00:40:22,225  X1:118 X2:600 Y1:342 Y2:418
I`m going to have to break it down.
Back away!

436
00:40:29,205 --> 00:40:30,536  X1:214 X2:504 Y1:376 Y2:418
It`s quite dramatic...

437
00:40:31,007 --> 00:40:33,737  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:342 Y2:418
...but you`re wasting your time.
It`s aII seaIed up.

438
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:36,911  X1:110 X2:608 Y1:342 Y2:418
-Weren`t you in an orange jumpsuit?
-Don`t go there.

439
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:38,777  X1:114 X2:603 Y1:376 Y2:418
What do you mean, ``aII seaIed up``?

440
00:40:38,848 --> 00:40:41,646  X1:133 X2:584 Y1:342 Y2:418
What part of that code
are you having troubIe cracking?

441
00:40:41,718 --> 00:40:43,345  X1:152 X2:566 Y1:376 Y2:418
The entire house is seaIed up.

442
00:40:44,153 --> 00:40:46,621  X1:133 X2:585 Y1:342 Y2:413
-There must be another way out.
-I`ve Iooked.

443
00:40:46,689 --> 00:40:49,783  X1:077 X2:641 Y1:342 Y2:418
We`II Iook again, right after I find my son.
Now get up.

444
00:40:49,859 --> 00:40:51,918  X1:123 X2:595 Y1:376 Y2:418
That`s aII right, I`II wait right here.

445
00:40:53,196 --> 00:40:57,724  X1:116 X2:602 Y1:342 Y2:418
I don`t know what is going on here,
or who the heII you are.

446
00:40:58,267 --> 00:40:59,962  X1:193 X2:523 Y1:376 Y2:418
And my son is missing.

447
00:41:00,036 --> 00:41:03,301  X1:088 X2:631 Y1:342 Y2:418
So, untiI those questions are answered,
you`re not Ieaving my sight.

448
00:41:04,574 --> 00:41:05,563  X1:261 X2:455 Y1:376 Y2:418
Now, get up!

449
00:41:06,876 --> 00:41:09,208  X1:224 X2:492 Y1:376 Y2:418
AII right. Breathe.

450
00:41:13,716 --> 00:41:15,206  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:376 Y2:418
Did the Iawyer spIit?

451
00:41:25,795 --> 00:41:27,126  X1:301 X2:418 Y1:376 Y2:418
Bobby.

452
00:41:28,998 --> 00:41:30,488  X1:301 X2:418 Y1:376 Y2:418
Bobby.

453
00:00:41,661 --> 00:00:44,061  X1:155 X2:560 Y1:376 Y2:418
Come on, guys! Stop hiding!

454
00:00:50,369 --> 00:00:51,358  X1:299 X2:420 Y1:376 Y2:418
Bobby!

455
00:00:51,637 --> 00:00:53,298  X1:193 X2:523 Y1:342 Y2:418
-Bobby.
-Come on out now, paI!

456
00:00:53,372 --> 00:00:54,703  X1:198 X2:519 Y1:376 Y2:418
Stop screwing around.

457
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,604  X1:165 X2:552 Y1:342 Y2:418
GIass famiIy Robinson,
you`re wasting your breath.

458
00:00:57,677 --> 00:01:00,373  X1:078 X2:639 Y1:376 Y2:418
This is ectobar gIass. He won`t hear you.

459
00:01:00,446 --> 00:01:02,744  X1:109 X2:608 Y1:376 Y2:418
This is shatterproof and soundproof.

460
00:01:03,182 --> 00:01:04,479  X1:239 X2:478 Y1:376 Y2:413
What are these?

461
00:01:04,617 --> 00:01:08,519  X1:141 X2:577 Y1:342 Y2:418
That`s a IittIe harder to expIain.
They`re containment speIIs.

462
00:01:08,587 --> 00:01:10,316  X1:181 X2:537 Y1:376 Y2:413
Ghosts can`t cross those.

463
00:01:10,756 --> 00:01:13,418  X1:261 X2:457 Y1:342 Y2:418
-Ghosts?
-Yes, ghosts.

464
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:18,692  X1:077 X2:640 Y1:342 Y2:418
The supernaturaI reaIm has its own Iaws.
For ghosts, it`s speIIs.

465
00:01:19,031 --> 00:01:23,127  X1:101 X2:617 Y1:342 Y2:418
Written or spoken, the ghosts
have to obey whatever the speIIs say.

466
00:01:42,722 --> 00:01:45,213  X1:076 X2:642 Y1:376 Y2:418
The entire basement is fiIIed with ghosts.

467
00:01:45,458 --> 00:01:46,948  X1:229 X2:488 Y1:376 Y2:413
In this basement?

468
00:01:47,326 --> 00:01:51,990  X1:077 X2:638 Y1:342 Y2:418
Of course, in this basement.
If it was next door, I wouIdn`t give a shit!

469
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,560  X1:315 X2:402 Y1:376 Y2:413
Dad!

470
00:01:56,235 --> 00:01:58,795  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:342 Y2:418
-I can prove it.
-I gave a pair of those to Bobby.

471
00:02:03,576 --> 00:02:06,238  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:342 Y2:418
SpectraI viewers.
You can see ghosts with these.

472
00:02:06,312 --> 00:02:08,041  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:376 Y2:418
Bobby, come on.

473
00:02:08,114 --> 00:02:11,277  X1:111 X2:606 Y1:342 Y2:418
-I don`t see any ghosts.
-Because they`re Iocked downstairs.

474
00:02:11,417 --> 00:02:12,748  X1:315 X2:402 Y1:376 Y2:413
Dad!

475
00:02:13,419 --> 00:02:16,115  X1:113 X2:605 Y1:342 Y2:413
There`s more of this crazy speII shit
on the fIoor.

476
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,080  X1:231 X2:488 Y1:376 Y2:413
Let me see those.

477
00:02:26,899 --> 00:02:29,094  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:376 Y2:418
Bobby! Come on out, paI!

478
00:02:30,503 --> 00:02:34,633  X1:102 X2:615 Y1:342 Y2:418
Hidden barrier speIIs.
Why wouId he need more protection?

479
00:02:34,707 --> 00:02:37,835  X1:190 X2:526 Y1:342 Y2:418
AII right, that`s enough.
This is not heIping.

480
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:41,073  X1:094 X2:623 Y1:342 Y2:413
Do me a favor and stop
with aII the haunted house nonsense...

481
00:02:41,147 --> 00:02:44,173  X1:151 X2:568 Y1:342 Y2:418
...at Ieast untiI we find the kid
and figure a way out of here.

482
00:02:44,784 --> 00:02:45,944  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:376 Y2:418
Bobby, come on.

483
00:02:46,018 --> 00:02:47,679  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:376 Y2:413
I don`t know where he couId be.

484
00:02:47,753 --> 00:02:49,812  X1:298 X2:419 Y1:376 Y2:416
No, no!

485
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:52,121  X1:309 X2:407 Y1:376 Y2:413
Wait!

486
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:56,724  X1:077 X2:640 Y1:342 Y2:418
What did I just say,
that there was a petting zoo downstairs?

487
00:02:56,962 --> 00:02:57,986  X1:322 X2:395 Y1:376 Y2:413
No!

488
00:02:58,063 --> 00:03:00,896  X1:106 X2:612 Y1:376 Y2:418
There are ghosts downstairs, Arthur.

489
00:03:00,966 --> 00:03:04,060  X1:136 X2:582 Y1:376 Y2:418
Right, right. But you aIso said...

490
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:07,762  X1:119 X2:600 Y1:376 Y2:418
...that they`re aII Iocked up. Right?

491
00:03:08,974 --> 00:03:11,101  X1:257 X2:460 Y1:342 Y2:413
-No. No way.
-Wait.

492
00:03:12,478 --> 00:03:13,809  X1:302 X2:417 Y1:376 Y2:413
Listen.

493
00:03:16,148 --> 00:03:17,775  X1:183 X2:535 Y1:376 Y2:418
I`II make a deaI with you.

494
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:20,546  X1:090 X2:627 Y1:376 Y2:418
I`II pay you whatever Cyrus owed you...

495
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,512  X1:201 X2:517 Y1:376 Y2:418
...if you just heIp me...

496
00:03:25,524 --> 00:03:27,355  X1:254 X2:465 Y1:376 Y2:418
...find my son.

497
00:03:39,538 --> 00:03:42,371  X1:126 X2:592 Y1:376 Y2:418
UnbeIievabIe. Get out of my way.

498
00:03:50,883 --> 00:03:52,214  X1:301 X2:418 Y1:376 Y2:418
Bobby.

499
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:14,767  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:342 Y2:418
Get out of the basement.
You need to go upstairs.

500
00:04:18,244 --> 00:04:20,576  X1:127 X2:592 Y1:376 Y2:418
You need to put on those glasses.

501
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,071  X1:239 X2:480 Y1:376 Y2:413
Leave me alone!

502
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:28,409  X1:164 X2:557 Y1:376 Y2:418
That`s it. That`s a good boy.

503
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,090  X1:301 X2:418 Y1:376 Y2:418
Bobby.

504
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:39,090  X1:301 X2:418 Y1:376 Y2:418
Bobby.

505
00:04:39,598 --> 00:04:41,930  X1:135 X2:583 Y1:376 Y2:418
Go upstairs and find your father.

506
00:04:43,168 --> 00:04:44,032  X1:304 X2:413 Y1:376 Y2:413
Mom?

507
00:04:44,436 --> 00:04:45,425  X1:303 X2:415 Y1:376 Y2:413
Go on.

508
00:04:46,872 --> 00:04:48,533  X1:265 X2:454 Y1:376 Y2:418
Go upstairs!

509
00:04:51,777 --> 00:04:53,438  X1:253 X2:465 Y1:376 Y2:418
Go find Kathy.

510
00:04:54,446 --> 00:04:55,811  X1:277 X2:444 Y1:376 Y2:413
Watch out.

511
00:04:58,284 --> 00:04:59,683  X1:277 X2:444 Y1:376 Y2:413
Watch out.

512
00:05:00,085 --> 00:05:01,746  X1:229 X2:488 Y1:376 Y2:418
Bobby! Come on!

513
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:08,454  X1:065 X2:652 Y1:376 Y2:418
You don`t have to scream, aII right? Just...

514
00:05:09,461 --> 00:05:10,792  X1:302 X2:416 Y1:376 Y2:413
...chiII.

515
00:05:29,782 --> 00:05:32,080  X1:193 X2:524 Y1:342 Y2:413
-This way.
-HoId on. Listen to me.

516
00:05:34,153 --> 00:05:36,781  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:342 Y2:418
This wiII take forever.
This pIace is just too big.

517
00:05:39,491 --> 00:05:43,325  X1:127 X2:592 Y1:342 Y2:413
Kathy and I wiII head up this way.
You two check down there.

518
00:05:43,395 --> 00:05:46,159  X1:109 X2:608 Y1:342 Y2:418
-No, I don`t think we shouId spIit up.
-It`s okay.

519
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:50,894  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:342 Y2:413
Go in a straight Iine, turn around.
We`II meet back here in five.

520
00:05:51,637 --> 00:05:54,128  X1:239 X2:479 Y1:376 Y2:413
Five. Back here.

521
00:05:54,506 --> 00:05:55,768  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:376 Y2:418
Don`t touch anything.

522
00:05:55,841 --> 00:05:58,207  X1:158 X2:558 Y1:342 Y2:413
-I don`t want to go with him!
-Go ahead.

523
00:06:07,453 --> 00:06:09,614  X1:128 X2:590 Y1:376 Y2:418
Let`s go back to the ghost thingy.

524
00:06:09,855 --> 00:06:14,019  X1:080 X2:638 Y1:342 Y2:418
There are ghosts down here.
If you don`t beIieve me, Iook for yourseIf.

525
00:06:14,259 --> 00:06:16,284  X1:131 X2:586 Y1:376 Y2:418
I toId you, I can`t see any ghosts.

526
00:06:16,362 --> 00:06:20,856  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:342 Y2:418
What the heII? Give me those.
Let me see. Why are these open?

527
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:24,533  X1:189 X2:528 Y1:342 Y2:418
I was down here before.
They weren`t open.

528
00:06:26,805 --> 00:06:29,603  X1:123 X2:593 Y1:342 Y2:413
-God! I hate it when they do that!
-Do what?

529
00:06:30,309 --> 00:06:34,678  X1:125 X2:594 Y1:342 Y2:418
They wait for you to put your face
up to the gIass, then give you...

530
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,011  X1:230 X2:487 Y1:376 Y2:418
...a big, fat ``boo``!

531
00:06:37,216 --> 00:06:38,547  X1:255 X2:462 Y1:376 Y2:413
Don`t do that!

532
00:06:43,022 --> 00:06:44,080  X1:314 X2:403 Y1:376 Y2:413
God.

533
00:06:44,523 --> 00:06:45,785  X1:300 X2:418 Y1:376 Y2:413
See it?

534
00:06:46,658 --> 00:06:48,455  X1:276 X2:442 Y1:342 Y2:418
-It`s, it`s....
-A ghost.

535
00:06:48,527 --> 00:06:52,361  X1:118 X2:596 Y1:342 Y2:418
Just Iike I`ve been saying aII night!
FinaIIy, a beIiever!

536
00:06:52,731 --> 00:06:56,030  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:342 Y2:413
Ghosts are around us aII the time.
Most of them can`t hurt us.

537
00:06:56,435 --> 00:07:00,735  X1:083 X2:635 Y1:342 Y2:418
Most don`t want to.
Ghosts here, ghosts there, no one cares.

538
00:07:00,873 --> 00:07:03,865  X1:164 X2:554 Y1:342 Y2:413
But there are exceptions,
Iike this bad-ass behind me.

539
00:07:04,009 --> 00:07:08,173  X1:079 X2:638 Y1:342 Y2:418
Those who die vioIentIy stay in
a tortured reaIm, so that`s aII they know.

540
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,045  X1:229 X2:489 Y1:376 Y2:418
What is he doing?

541
00:07:10,249 --> 00:07:13,776  X1:183 X2:535 Y1:342 Y2:418
I don`t know. I can`t see.
I don`t have the gIasses.

542
00:07:16,755 --> 00:07:19,349  X1:112 X2:605 Y1:376 Y2:418
I`ve had it with this. It`s time to go.

543
00:07:19,425 --> 00:07:21,757  X1:237 X2:481 Y1:342 Y2:413
-Now! PIease!
-Don`t touch me.

544
00:07:22,795 --> 00:07:24,353  X1:226 X2:492 Y1:376 Y2:418
WiII you come on?

545
00:07:30,536 --> 00:07:33,232  X1:102 X2:613 Y1:342 Y2:418
Come on, ghost boy! Move your ass!
It`s time to go.

546
00:07:36,008 --> 00:07:39,000  X1:078 X2:640 Y1:376 Y2:418
Dad, sIow down. We`re going to get Iost.

547
00:07:57,796 --> 00:07:59,127  X1:315 X2:405 Y1:376 Y2:413
Dad!

548
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,800  X1:316 X2:402 Y1:376 Y2:413
Dad.

549
00:08:10,142 --> 00:08:11,803  X1:260 X2:458 Y1:376 Y2:413
Listen to me.

550
00:08:12,644 --> 00:08:14,475  X1:202 X2:516 Y1:376 Y2:418
He`s going to be okay.

551
00:08:15,414 --> 00:08:17,245  X1:189 X2:529 Y1:376 Y2:418
We`re going to find him.

552
00:08:17,983 --> 00:08:20,315  X1:131 X2:586 Y1:376 Y2:418
I am so ready to Ieave this pIace.

553
00:08:21,487 --> 00:08:23,182  X1:286 X2:431 Y1:342 Y2:413
-Oh, boy.
-What?

554
00:08:24,123 --> 00:08:27,217  X1:131 X2:586 Y1:342 Y2:413
-That`s the symboI of The JackaI.
-What`s The JackaI?

555
00:08:27,292 --> 00:08:31,524  X1:063 X2:654 Y1:342 Y2:416
The JackaI is the CharIie Manson of ghosts.
If he`s out, screw the kid.

556
00:08:31,797 --> 00:08:33,765  X1:095 X2:622 Y1:376 Y2:418
We`ve got to get out of this basement.

557
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:36,995  X1:066 X2:652 Y1:376 Y2:418
Maybe Rafkin was right, and maybe there--

558
00:08:37,069 --> 00:08:38,229  X1:302 X2:414 Y1:376 Y2:418
Kathy!

559
00:08:39,671 --> 00:08:41,662  X1:137 X2:580 Y1:376 Y2:418
Think about what you`re saying.

560
00:08:43,342 --> 00:08:45,435  X1:131 X2:586 Y1:376 Y2:418
There is no such thing as ghosts.

561
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:00,021  X1:304 X2:415 Y1:376 Y2:418
Kathy.

562
00:09:01,693 --> 00:09:03,786  X1:302 X2:414 Y1:376 Y2:418
Kathy!

563
00:09:15,974 --> 00:09:19,034  X1:182 X2:533 Y1:342 Y2:413
What is it? I can`t see it!
TeII me where it is!

564
00:09:20,045 --> 00:09:21,205  X1:295 X2:421 Y1:376 Y2:413
Get off!

565
00:09:23,982 --> 00:09:25,643  X1:190 X2:526 Y1:376 Y2:418
HoId on! Stay with me!

566
00:09:36,562 --> 00:09:37,551  X1:250 X2:466 Y1:376 Y2:418
Come on, puII!

567
00:09:37,829 --> 00:09:40,821  X1:201 X2:517 Y1:342 Y2:418
-Who are you?
-Never mind, just puII.

568
00:09:42,434 --> 00:09:45,767  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:376 Y2:418
Shit! Don`t speak. Don`t move.

569
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:48,499  X1:268 X2:450 Y1:376 Y2:413
Somehow...

570
00:09:49,241 --> 00:09:51,141  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:376 Y2:418
...we got behind enemy Iines.

571
00:10:00,452 --> 00:10:01,783  X1:304 X2:413 Y1:376 Y2:418
Hurry!

572
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,351  X1:256 X2:461 Y1:376 Y2:418
PIease, hurry!

573
00:10:05,357 --> 00:10:07,018  X1:251 X2:468 Y1:376 Y2:418
Hey, IittIe guy.

574
00:10:07,459 --> 00:10:09,086  X1:190 X2:528 Y1:342 Y2:418
-How.
-Don`t tease the ghosts.

575
00:10:09,161 --> 00:10:12,790  X1:078 X2:639 Y1:342 Y2:418
-WiII you shut up?
-You shut up. You keep pissing them off.

576
00:10:13,865 --> 00:10:16,527  X1:322 X2:395 Y1:376 Y2:413
Go.

577
00:10:21,373 --> 00:10:22,931  X1:287 X2:429 Y1:342 Y2:413
-Maggie!
-What?

578
00:10:29,214 --> 00:10:31,876  X1:104 X2:611 Y1:342 Y2:418
Where?
I can`t see without the gIasses, idiot!

579
00:10:32,217 --> 00:10:35,846  X1:114 X2:601 Y1:342 Y2:418
WeII, I can see.
And I think you shouId go this way!

580
00:10:36,989 --> 00:10:38,388  X1:297 X2:419 Y1:376 Y2:418
Go, go!

581
00:10:42,227 --> 00:10:44,161  X1:178 X2:539 Y1:376 Y2:418
It`s aII right. I`ve got you.

582
00:10:45,597 --> 00:10:46,723  X1:269 X2:449 Y1:376 Y2:413
Look at me.

583
00:10:47,466 --> 00:10:48,797  X1:301 X2:418 Y1:376 Y2:418
Daddy.

584
00:10:49,401 --> 00:10:51,062  X1:286 X2:432 Y1:376 Y2:418
It`s okay.

585
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,377  X1:204 X2:514 Y1:376 Y2:418
Who the heII are you?

586
00:11:03,749 --> 00:11:06,149  X1:161 X2:555 Y1:376 Y2:413
And what the heII was that?

587
00:11:06,752 --> 00:11:10,210  X1:100 X2:618 Y1:342 Y2:418
My name is KaIina Oretzia.
I`m in the spirit recIamation business.

588
00:11:10,289 --> 00:11:11,278  X1:303 X2:414 Y1:376 Y2:413
What?

589
00:11:11,757 --> 00:11:13,418  X1:161 X2:557 Y1:376 Y2:418
I free trapped souIs. Cyrus--

590
00:11:13,492 --> 00:11:16,825  X1:147 X2:572 Y1:342 Y2:413
Forget Cyrus, who traps souIs,
for a damn second.

591
00:11:17,429 --> 00:11:19,420  X1:179 X2:539 Y1:376 Y2:418
What are you doing here?

592
00:11:19,865 --> 00:11:22,698  X1:106 X2:612 Y1:376 Y2:418
Looks to me Iike I`m saving your ass.

593
00:11:24,369 --> 00:11:27,532  X1:144 X2:571 Y1:342 Y2:413
Oh, my God!
It`s over there! It`s over there!

594
00:11:28,106 --> 00:11:29,698  X1:198 X2:520 Y1:376 Y2:418
Give him your gIasses.

595
00:11:30,609 --> 00:11:31,598  X1:282 X2:434 Y1:376 Y2:413
Come on!

596
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,122  X1:264 X2:453 Y1:376 Y2:418
Oh, my God.

597
00:11:49,961 --> 00:11:51,451  X1:258 X2:461 Y1:376 Y2:413
UnbeIievabIe.

598
00:11:51,563 --> 00:11:53,895  X1:140 X2:576 Y1:376 Y2:418
Another one of Cyrus`s victims.

599
00:11:54,466 --> 00:11:57,128  X1:107 X2:610 Y1:376 Y2:418
I hope to God the barrier speIIs hoId.

600
00:11:58,804 --> 00:11:59,793  X1:287 X2:430 Y1:376 Y2:413
Victims?

601
00:12:00,372 --> 00:12:02,897  X1:068 X2:650 Y1:376 Y2:418
Cyrus had a nasty habit of ensIaving souIs.

602
00:12:03,008 --> 00:12:05,875  X1:164 X2:554 Y1:342 Y2:413
That`s why I`m here.
I intend to set them aII free.

603
00:12:05,977 --> 00:12:07,342  X1:260 X2:458 Y1:376 Y2:413
Listen to me.

604
00:12:07,979 --> 00:12:09,537  X1:237 X2:481 Y1:376 Y2:413
I need to know...

605
00:12:10,248 --> 00:12:12,079  X1:200 X2:518 Y1:376 Y2:418
...how you got in here.

606
00:12:12,584 --> 00:12:15,417  X1:076 X2:642 Y1:342 Y2:413
I sIipped through an opening in the house
when it shifted.

607
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,978  X1:087 X2:631 Y1:342 Y2:418
-An opening where?
-It`s cIosed now. It won`t happen again.

608
00:12:19,991 --> 00:12:22,653  X1:090 X2:629 Y1:376 Y2:418
Let me show you. This is the Arcanum.

609
00:12:23,161 --> 00:12:25,322  X1:177 X2:540 Y1:342 Y2:418
Many peopIe died
in the quest for this book.

610
00:12:25,397 --> 00:12:28,798  X1:127 X2:592 Y1:342 Y2:418
It was written in the 15th century
by an astroIoger named BasiIeus.

611
00:12:28,867 --> 00:12:31,836  X1:131 X2:585 Y1:342 Y2:418
In it, he describes
the making of a certain machine.

612
00:12:31,903 --> 00:12:34,337  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:376 Y2:413
One that can see into the future.

613
00:12:34,406 --> 00:12:37,068  X1:143 X2:576 Y1:342 Y2:418
He wrote it whiIe he was under
demonic possession.

614
00:12:37,509 --> 00:12:39,500  X1:163 X2:555 Y1:376 Y2:418
I can`t beIieve Cyrus buiIt it.

615
00:12:39,845 --> 00:12:43,008  X1:081 X2:638 Y1:376 Y2:418
BuiIt what? What are you taIking about?

616
00:12:43,348 --> 00:12:45,009  X1:231 X2:487 Y1:376 Y2:413
BasiIeus`s device.

617
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:49,577  X1:066 X2:653 Y1:342 Y2:418
We`re in the middIe of a machine, designed
by the deviI and powered by the dead.

618
00:12:50,622 --> 00:12:51,987  X1:260 X2:458 Y1:376 Y2:413
Listen to me.

619
00:12:53,525 --> 00:12:55,925  X1:094 X2:624 Y1:376 Y2:418
I don`t give a shit about any machine...

620
00:12:56,294 --> 00:12:58,762  X1:119 X2:599 Y1:376 Y2:418
...or deviI or BasiIeus or anything...

621
00:12:59,464 --> 00:13:02,524  X1:172 X2:548 Y1:342 Y2:418
...except getting my famiIy
the heII out of this pIace.

622
00:13:03,301 --> 00:13:06,862  X1:123 X2:594 Y1:342 Y2:413
I came here
to set the souIs in this house free.

623
00:13:07,205 --> 00:13:10,197  X1:077 X2:640 Y1:376 Y2:418
You want heIp, you have to heIp me first.

624
00:13:12,043 --> 00:13:13,635  X1:208 X2:510 Y1:376 Y2:418
Kathy, can you waIk?

625
00:13:16,715 --> 00:13:19,377  X1:082 X2:635 Y1:376 Y2:418
Kathy! Oh, no. This can`t be happening!

626
00:13:19,451 --> 00:13:22,818  X1:074 X2:643 Y1:342 Y2:418
-We have to get out of here.
-I`m not going anywhere without my kids.

627
00:13:22,888 --> 00:13:24,480  X1:215 X2:502 Y1:376 Y2:418
Try teIIing him that.

628
00:13:31,396 --> 00:13:32,727  X1:283 X2:434 Y1:376 Y2:413
Come on.

629
00:13:44,075 --> 00:13:46,407  X1:214 X2:504 Y1:376 Y2:418
This way. Come on.

630
00:13:48,246 --> 00:13:50,578  X1:239 X2:479 Y1:376 Y2:418
Stairs. Let`s go.

631
00:13:51,917 --> 00:13:54,408  X1:264 X2:452 Y1:376 Y2:418
Go. You go!

632
00:13:56,254 --> 00:13:57,915  X1:241 X2:476 Y1:376 Y2:413
Don`t touch me!

633
00:13:58,256 --> 00:13:59,917  X1:220 X2:496 Y1:376 Y2:418
Wait! The gIasses!

634
00:14:00,192 --> 00:14:01,921  X1:176 X2:538 Y1:376 Y2:413
You`II need these! Catch!

635
00:14:12,037 --> 00:14:14,062  X1:278 X2:440 Y1:342 Y2:418
-Good job.
-Sorry.

636
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,811  X1:169 X2:549 Y1:376 Y2:413
Perfect. Another dead end.

637
00:14:23,982 --> 00:14:26,883  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:342 Y2:418
Okay, genius, we found the stairs.
How do we get to them?

638
00:14:26,952 --> 00:14:29,147  X1:155 X2:562 Y1:342 Y2:413
-Get away.
-What? What do we do now?

639
00:14:29,254 --> 00:14:31,085  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:376 Y2:418
Get away from the gIass.

640
00:14:31,156 --> 00:14:33,317  X1:274 X2:443 Y1:342 Y2:413
-Why?
-Just do it.

641
00:14:57,148 --> 00:14:58,342  X1:290 X2:427 Y1:376 Y2:413
GIasses.

642
00:15:04,256 --> 00:15:05,484  X1:308 X2:409 Y1:376 Y2:413
Duck!

643
00:15:06,424 --> 00:15:07,914  X1:246 X2:469 Y1:376 Y2:413
Move! Go Ieft!

644
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:11,356  X1:137 X2:580 Y1:342 Y2:418
Do something, for Christ`s sake!
We`re running out of corridors!

645
00:15:11,429 --> 00:15:14,523  X1:135 X2:581 Y1:376 Y2:418
Duck! Go Ieft! Go right! Move!

646
00:15:16,434 --> 00:15:17,696  X1:276 X2:439 Y1:376 Y2:413
Get down!

647
00:15:22,774 --> 00:15:26,767  X1:104 X2:615 Y1:342 Y2:418
Here. We`ve got to get to the Iibrary.
It has speII protection aII around it.

648
00:15:27,612 --> 00:15:29,375  X1:183 X2:534 Y1:376 Y2:413
Where is that from here?

649
00:15:47,866 --> 00:15:50,232  X1:098 X2:620 Y1:376 Y2:418
Can I reIy on you not to get me kiIIed?

650
00:15:50,869 --> 00:15:52,461  X1:214 X2:504 Y1:376 Y2:418
I guarantee nothing.

651
00:16:06,418 --> 00:16:08,079  X1:253 X2:465 Y1:376 Y2:418
See anything?

652
00:16:11,923 --> 00:16:13,550  X1:274 X2:443 Y1:342 Y2:413
-Anything?
-No.

653
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,091  X1:283 X2:434 Y1:376 Y2:413
Come on.

654
00:16:17,596 --> 00:16:19,860  X1:146 X2:572 Y1:376 Y2:418
I think they`re just downstairs.

655
00:16:23,768 --> 00:16:25,099  X1:290 X2:429 Y1:376 Y2:418
Nothing.

656
00:16:28,206 --> 00:16:31,539  X1:176 X2:542 Y1:342 Y2:418
If we get out of this aIive,
I`ve got to get a pay raise.

657
00:16:33,445 --> 00:16:34,673  X1:240 X2:478 Y1:376 Y2:418
That`s a big ``if.``

658
00:16:37,949 --> 00:16:39,143  X1:229 X2:488 Y1:376 Y2:413
Give me the fIare.

659
00:16:42,454 --> 00:16:46,288  X1:089 X2:629 Y1:342 Y2:418
What`s wrong?
Don`t start freaking out now. Come on.

660
00:16:55,433 --> 00:16:56,559  X1:303 X2:414 Y1:376 Y2:413
What?

661
00:17:00,138 --> 00:17:02,129  X1:254 X2:463 Y1:342 Y2:418
-Okay. What?
-Shut up.

662
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:04,069  X1:227 X2:491 Y1:376 Y2:413
Give me the book.

663
00:17:07,646 --> 00:17:09,307  X1:257 X2:459 Y1:376 Y2:418
Just back up.

664
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,411  X1:278 X2:440 Y1:376 Y2:413
Go. SIow.

665
00:17:13,618 --> 00:17:15,483  X1:241 X2:476 Y1:342 Y2:413
-I`m going sIow.
-SIow.

666
00:17:16,087 --> 00:17:17,816  X1:289 X2:426 Y1:376 Y2:413
Go! Go!

667
00:17:18,156 --> 00:17:19,487  X1:312 X2:404 Y1:376 Y2:413
Fast!

668
00:17:23,228 --> 00:17:24,889  X1:246 X2:471 Y1:342 Y2:413
-What the heII?
-Who the heII?

669
00:17:24,963 --> 00:17:26,828  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:376 Y2:418
What the heII are you doing here?

670
00:17:33,838 --> 00:17:35,032  X1:312 X2:403 Y1:376 Y2:413
Shit!

671
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:40,668  X1:243 X2:474 Y1:376 Y2:413
Remember me?

672
00:17:49,688 --> 00:17:51,451  X1:161 X2:556 Y1:376 Y2:418
Thanks for taking your time.

673
00:17:51,523 --> 00:17:53,753  X1:091 X2:626 Y1:376 Y2:418
Go down the haII. Turn Ieft, then right.

674
00:17:53,825 --> 00:17:55,918  X1:204 X2:514 Y1:342 Y2:418
-Where are we going?
-Trust me, okay?

675
00:17:55,994 --> 00:17:57,859  X1:277 X2:441 Y1:342 Y2:413
-Arthur?
-Trust her.

676
00:17:57,929 --> 00:17:59,760  X1:251 X2:465 Y1:376 Y2:418
Okay, Iet`s go!

677
00:17:59,831 --> 00:18:02,231  X1:210 X2:508 Y1:342 Y2:418
-Who the heII is she?
-I`II expIain her Iater.

678
00:19:08,767 --> 00:19:10,257  X1:178 X2:540 Y1:376 Y2:418
What happened to Kathy?

679
00:19:10,335 --> 00:19:11,962  X1:147 X2:570 Y1:376 Y2:418
I don`t know, she disappeared.

680
00:19:12,036 --> 00:19:15,130  X1:133 X2:587 Y1:342 Y2:418
How do you Iose an entire famiIy
in a gIass house?

681
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:27,247  X1:296 X2:419 Y1:376 Y2:413
Arthur!

682
00:19:30,488 --> 00:19:32,149  X1:196 X2:520 Y1:376 Y2:418
KaIina, give me a fIare!

683
00:19:39,464 --> 00:19:41,796  X1:199 X2:516 Y1:376 Y2:418
Get him! Go! Get up!

684
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,762  X1:100 X2:615 Y1:376 Y2:418
This is not the time to be a girI! Run!

685
00:19:45,904 --> 00:19:48,839  X1:121 X2:594 Y1:376 Y2:418
Stop dragging your ass, man! Go!

686
00:19:49,374 --> 00:19:51,501  X1:193 X2:523 Y1:376 Y2:418
Oh, my God! Go! Run!

687
00:19:51,576 --> 00:19:54,670  X1:166 X2:548 Y1:342 Y2:416
Now is not the time
to sit around, Arthur! Run!

688
00:19:54,946 --> 00:19:56,880  X1:151 X2:564 Y1:376 Y2:413
Get the door. CIose the door!

689
00:20:01,553 --> 00:20:03,612  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:376 Y2:418
Arthur, are you aII right?

690
00:20:04,722 --> 00:20:07,987  X1:168 X2:550 Y1:342 Y2:418
God, what`s going on here?
Fucking ghosts.

691
00:20:08,426 --> 00:20:09,859  X1:251 X2:466 Y1:376 Y2:418
I hate this job.

692
00:20:10,228 --> 00:20:13,061  X1:072 X2:645 Y1:376 Y2:418
They don`t Iike you, either. I wonder why.

693
00:20:16,034 --> 00:20:17,968  X1:129 X2:587 Y1:376 Y2:418
You got something to say, say it.

694
00:20:18,036 --> 00:20:21,301  X1:147 X2:569 Y1:342 Y2:418
AII right. Let`s start with:
This is aII your goddamn fauIt!

695
00:20:21,372 --> 00:20:24,239  X1:115 X2:602 Y1:342 Y2:418
If you hadn`t caught them,
we wouIdn`t be running from them.

696
00:20:24,309 --> 00:20:26,300  X1:106 X2:609 Y1:376 Y2:413
It was his uncIe that buiIt the house!

697
00:20:26,377 --> 00:20:29,972  X1:075 X2:641 Y1:342 Y2:418
You heIped him. How couId you heIp him
without knowing what he was doing?

698
00:20:34,886 --> 00:20:37,354  X1:204 X2:513 Y1:342 Y2:418
-I had my reasons.
-Money, you parasite.

699
00:20:37,422 --> 00:20:41,222  X1:112 X2:603 Y1:342 Y2:418
You stoIe peopIe`s souIs for money!
How depraved is that?

700
00:20:41,559 --> 00:20:44,392  X1:074 X2:642 Y1:376 Y2:418
If you haven`t noticed, I`m a bit of a freak!

701
00:20:44,596 --> 00:20:47,929  X1:092 X2:626 Y1:342 Y2:418
I come within 10 feet of anything dead,
I go into seizures.

702
00:20:48,032 --> 00:20:52,799  X1:077 X2:641 Y1:342 Y2:418
I touch somebody, a whoIe Iife fuII of shit
fIashes in front of my eyes.

703
00:20:53,204 --> 00:20:54,865  X1:193 X2:524 Y1:376 Y2:418
So, yeah, I`m depraved.

704
00:20:54,939 --> 00:20:57,499  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:342 Y2:418
But Cyrus was my friend,
and he accepted me.

705
00:20:59,077 --> 00:21:01,568  X1:078 X2:638 Y1:376 Y2:418
He didn`t accept you. You`re so pathetic!

706
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,640  X1:204 X2:514 Y1:342 Y2:418
-He used you.
-Shut up, both of you.

707
00:21:05,516 --> 00:21:08,883  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:342 Y2:413
Cut him some sIack.
What difference does it make?

708
00:21:10,755 --> 00:21:12,655  X1:161 X2:555 Y1:376 Y2:418
You didn`t teII him, did you?

709
00:21:13,591 --> 00:21:15,582  X1:173 X2:545 Y1:376 Y2:413
TeII me what? What now?

710
00:21:16,094 --> 00:21:17,925  X1:191 X2:525 Y1:376 Y2:418
About the fourth ghost.

711
00:21:20,698 --> 00:21:23,030  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:376 Y2:413
Don`t do this. I didn`t teII him.

712
00:21:23,134 --> 00:21:24,829  X1:195 X2:524 Y1:376 Y2:418
He has a right to know.

713
00:21:27,605 --> 00:21:29,436  X1:153 X2:564 Y1:376 Y2:418
What about the fourth ghost?

714
00:21:30,608 --> 00:21:33,702  X1:106 X2:611 Y1:376 Y2:418
St. Luke`s HospitaI. Six months ago.

715
00:21:43,454 --> 00:21:46,150  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:376 Y2:418
You`re saying my wife`s spirit...

716
00:21:46,557 --> 00:21:48,388  X1:174 X2:544 Y1:376 Y2:418
...is trapped in this house?

717
00:21:51,229 --> 00:21:52,628  X1:229 X2:489 Y1:376 Y2:418
I didn`t know you.

718
00:21:54,132 --> 00:21:56,726  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:342 Y2:413
I didn`t know her.
I didn`t know she had a husband.

719
00:22:00,805 --> 00:22:04,707  X1:167 X2:551 Y1:342 Y2:418
Why? In God`s name, why?
TeII me, why her?

720
00:22:04,776 --> 00:22:07,677  X1:096 X2:622 Y1:342 Y2:418
I don`t know. Cyrus handpicked them,
incIuding your wife.

721
00:22:07,745 --> 00:22:10,578  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:342 Y2:418
I figured out who you were
and I`ve been trying to heIp you.

722
00:22:10,648 --> 00:22:15,085  X1:141 X2:573 Y1:342 Y2:418
You caII this heIp? She`s right!
This is aII your goddamn fauIt!

723
00:22:15,486 --> 00:22:17,317  X1:249 X2:466 Y1:376 Y2:413
Son of a bitch!

724
00:22:19,324 --> 00:22:22,157  X1:099 X2:618 Y1:376 Y2:418
You can save her. And your kids, too.

725
00:22:22,493 --> 00:22:25,428  X1:128 X2:588 Y1:376 Y2:413
Just Iisten to me and beIieve me.

726
00:22:26,331 --> 00:22:28,094  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:376 Y2:413
This house is not a house.

727
00:22:29,901 --> 00:22:31,266  X1:246 X2:472 Y1:376 Y2:413
It is a machine.

728
00:22:33,237 --> 00:22:37,401  X1:118 X2:600 Y1:342 Y2:418
A compIete and faithfuI re-creation
of BasiIeus`s design.

729
00:22:38,009 --> 00:22:41,536  X1:102 X2:616 Y1:342 Y2:418
According to this, there shouId be
12 earth-bound spirits trapped inside.

730
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:45,343  X1:135 X2:583 Y1:342 Y2:418
See these?
They represent the bIack zodiac.

731
00:22:45,516 --> 00:22:49,145  X1:063 X2:654 Y1:342 Y2:418
They represent the ghosts that
Cyrus needed to catch: The First-Born Son.

732
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,744  X1:214 X2:503 Y1:376 Y2:418
l don`t want to play.

The Torso.

734
00:22:56,794 --> 00:22:57,988  X1:219 X2:499 Y1:376 Y2:413
The Bound Woman.

735
00:23:00,932 --> 00:23:02,593  X1:214 X2:504 Y1:376 Y2:413
The Withered Lover.

736
00:23:04,369 --> 00:23:05,427  X1:309 X2:408 Y1:376 Y2:413
Jean.

737
00:23:11,676 --> 00:23:13,974  X1:226 X2:492 Y1:376 Y2:418
Bobby. l love you.

738
00:23:16,381 --> 00:23:17,871  X1:239 X2:478 Y1:376 Y2:413
The Torn Prince.

739
00:23:20,885 --> 00:23:22,409  X1:216 X2:501 Y1:376 Y2:418
The Angry Princess.

740
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:23,951  X1:283 X2:435 Y1:376 Y2:418
l`m sorry.

741
00:23:24,555 --> 00:23:25,886  X1:245 X2:472 Y1:376 Y2:418
The PiIgrimess.

742
00:23:27,458 --> 00:23:29,289  X1:106 X2:612 Y1:376 Y2:413
The Great ChiId and the Dire Mother.

743
00:23:31,963 --> 00:23:33,590  X1:258 X2:460 Y1:376 Y2:413
The Hammer.

744
00:23:36,234 --> 00:23:39,601  X1:118 X2:599 Y1:342 Y2:413
And here, the sign of HeII`s Winter:
The JackaI.

745
00:23:42,707 --> 00:23:44,174  X1:209 X2:508 Y1:376 Y2:418
And The Juggernaut.

746
00:23:47,178 --> 00:23:49,373  X1:119 X2:598 Y1:376 Y2:418
The machine required the energy...

747
00:23:49,447 --> 00:23:52,348  X1:180 X2:538 Y1:342 Y2:418
...of these specific spirits
in order to bring it to Iife.

748
00:23:52,583 --> 00:23:55,416  X1:116 X2:601 Y1:342 Y2:418
Once it engages,
the spirits are reIeased one by one.

749
00:23:55,753 --> 00:23:57,914  X1:077 X2:640 Y1:376 Y2:413
The house then draws them to its center.

750
00:23:57,989 --> 00:24:01,390  X1:079 X2:640 Y1:342 Y2:418
Each one adds its energy to the machine,
powering it up.

751
00:24:02,927 --> 00:24:04,895  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:376 Y2:418
Powering it up for what?

752
00:24:04,962 --> 00:24:06,896  X1:145 X2:573 Y1:376 Y2:418
To open the Ocularis lnfernum.

753
00:24:06,998 --> 00:24:08,693  X1:262 X2:455 Y1:376 Y2:413
What`s that?

754
00:24:08,766 --> 00:24:10,063  X1:284 X2:434 Y1:376 Y2:413
It`s Latin.

755
00:24:10,168 --> 00:24:13,604  X1:115 X2:603 Y1:376 Y2:418
Ocularis lnfernum. The Eye of HeII?

756
00:24:15,373 --> 00:24:16,601  X1:273 X2:443 Y1:376 Y2:418
Very good.

757
00:24:16,674 --> 00:24:21,134  X1:070 X2:649 Y1:342 Y2:418
The Eye of HeII. I`m stuck in a gIass house
with crazy white peopIe....

758
00:24:21,212 --> 00:24:22,201  X1:302 X2:415 Y1:376 Y2:413
Go on.

759
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:25,716  X1:066 X2:651 Y1:342 Y2:418
In heII, there is an eye
that sees everything, the past, the future...

760
00:24:25,783 --> 00:24:28,115  X1:181 X2:536 Y1:342 Y2:416
...heaven and earth,
the bIessed, the damned.

761
00:24:28,219 --> 00:24:31,711  X1:075 X2:642 Y1:342 Y2:413
If knowIedge is power,
then the man who controIs the Ocularis...

762
00:24:31,789 --> 00:24:34,053  X1:151 X2:567 Y1:342 Y2:413
...wouId be the most powerfuI
man on earth.

763
00:24:35,793 --> 00:24:36,885  X1:270 X2:446 Y1:376 Y2:413
Your uncIe.

764
00:24:37,462 --> 00:24:38,622  X1:304 X2:413 Y1:376 Y2:413
Great.

765
00:24:39,497 --> 00:24:40,657  X1:315 X2:402 Y1:376 Y2:413
So...

766
00:24:41,132 --> 00:24:44,226  X1:089 X2:629 Y1:376 Y2:418
...how many ghosts have been set free?

767
00:24:45,303 --> 00:24:47,396  X1:104 X2:614 Y1:376 Y2:413
EIeven. And the house needs tweIve.

768
00:24:47,638 --> 00:24:51,472  X1:066 X2:652 Y1:376 Y2:418
No. Damon said something about thirteen.

769
00:24:51,809 --> 00:24:53,470  X1:146 X2:572 Y1:376 Y2:418
That there are thirteen ghosts.

770
00:24:53,611 --> 00:24:55,772  X1:126 X2:592 Y1:376 Y2:418
The thirteenth ghost is a faiI-safe.

771
00:24:56,481 --> 00:25:00,941  X1:103 X2:615 Y1:342 Y2:413
To stop the process, the house needs
a sacrifice of Iife instead of death.

772
00:25:01,552 --> 00:25:03,918  X1:172 X2:544 Y1:376 Y2:418
A wiIIing, human sacrifice.

773
00:25:05,156 --> 00:25:07,181  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:376 Y2:413
A sacrifice of the broken heart.

774
00:25:07,492 --> 00:25:10,484  X1:159 X2:559 Y1:342 Y2:418
The onIy ghost to be created
out of an act of pure Iove.

775
00:25:10,895 --> 00:25:12,692  X1:163 X2:553 Y1:376 Y2:418
You`re the thirteenth ghost.

776
00:25:15,399 --> 00:25:18,835  X1:070 X2:648 Y1:342 Y2:418
The thirteenth spirit stands before the eye
at the finaI configuration.

777
00:25:18,903 --> 00:25:21,895  X1:129 X2:588 Y1:342 Y2:418
As the eye opens,
the spirit uses the power of Iife...

778
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:24,399  X1:156 X2:562 Y1:376 Y2:418
...to short-circuit the system.

779
00:25:24,842 --> 00:25:27,174  X1:165 X2:553 Y1:376 Y2:418
Uses the power of Iife how?

780
00:25:27,578 --> 00:25:29,205  X1:193 X2:526 Y1:376 Y2:418
By Ieaping into the eye.

781
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:32,579  X1:080 X2:637 Y1:342 Y2:418
And Arthur`s supposed to take this Ieap?
No fucking way, Iady.

782
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:35,544  X1:113 X2:605 Y1:376 Y2:418
That`s suicide. I won`t Iet you do it.

783
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:39,283  X1:067 X2:649 Y1:342 Y2:418
You need to come up with something eIse.
That`s not working.

784
00:25:40,024 --> 00:25:42,185  X1:125 X2:594 Y1:376 Y2:418
Love is the most powerfuI energy.

785
00:25:42,527 --> 00:25:43,858  X1:282 X2:436 Y1:376 Y2:418
Meaning?

786
00:25:44,762 --> 00:25:48,960  X1:100 X2:618 Y1:342 Y2:418
In order for you to save your chiIdren,
you must trade your Iife for theirs.

787
00:25:53,337 --> 00:25:54,861  X1:242 X2:476 Y1:376 Y2:413
Let me see this.

788
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:57,474  X1:145 X2:572 Y1:376 Y2:418
There`s got to be a better way.

789
00:25:58,843 --> 00:26:00,333  X1:230 X2:487 Y1:376 Y2:413
I don`t read Latin.

790
00:26:00,411 --> 00:26:03,642  X1:076 X2:643 Y1:342 Y2:418
WeII, we can try it the oId-fashioned way,
my personaI favorite.

791
00:26:03,781 --> 00:26:06,511  X1:164 X2:552 Y1:342 Y2:418
Nobody wiII be here
to brag about it afterwards.

792
00:26:06,617 --> 00:26:10,109  X1:093 X2:624 Y1:342 Y2:418
We need to come up with
a game pIan soon. Time`s running out.

793
00:26:10,621 --> 00:26:12,452  X1:110 X2:606 Y1:376 Y2:418
Are you going to bIow the pIace up?

794
00:26:12,557 --> 00:26:14,650  X1:097 X2:621 Y1:376 Y2:418
The Iast ghost is about to be reIeased.

795
00:26:14,725 --> 00:26:18,456  X1:079 X2:639 Y1:342 Y2:418
-I know why you feeI you have to do this.
-Get away from me.

796
00:26:18,529 --> 00:26:22,522  X1:104 X2:613 Y1:342 Y2:418
Psychics caII it a ``Iinking.``
We Iinked earIier. I saw everything...

797
00:26:23,067 --> 00:26:25,058  X1:185 X2:533 Y1:376 Y2:418
...about Jean, about you.

798
00:26:25,136 --> 00:26:28,833  X1:089 X2:628 Y1:342 Y2:418
Shut up.
I`m not going to Iisten to this from you.

799
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,367  X1:147 X2:571 Y1:376 Y2:418
KaIina is taIking about suicide.

800
00:26:31,442 --> 00:26:33,342  X1:175 X2:541 Y1:376 Y2:418
Anything to save my kids.

801
00:26:33,511 --> 00:26:36,571  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:342 Y2:418
It doesn`t add up.
It doesn`t make any sense.

802
00:26:36,647 --> 00:26:38,342  X1:145 X2:572 Y1:376 Y2:418
There`s got to be a better way.

803
00:26:38,416 --> 00:26:41,010  X1:137 X2:581 Y1:342 Y2:418
``Doesn`t add up``?
What does add up here, Dennis?

804
00:26:41,085 --> 00:26:43,553  X1:171 X2:548 Y1:342 Y2:418
How much of this equation
makes any sense at aII?

805
00:26:43,754 --> 00:26:46,245  X1:177 X2:540 Y1:376 Y2:413
Goddamn it. Goddamn it.

806
00:26:47,758 --> 00:26:50,192  X1:130 X2:586 Y1:376 Y2:418
AII I can think about are my kids.

807
00:26:51,729 --> 00:26:53,890  X1:130 X2:588 Y1:376 Y2:418
I don`t even know if they`re aIive.

808
00:26:56,367 --> 00:26:58,631  X1:112 X2:605 Y1:376 Y2:418
Then Iet`s go out there and find out.

809
00:26:59,604 --> 00:27:02,698  X1:111 X2:606 Y1:342 Y2:418
One Iast time,
whiIe there`s stiII time, you and me.

810
00:27:13,684 --> 00:27:15,049  X1:293 X2:425 Y1:376 Y2:413
KaIina...

811
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:18,782  X1:137 X2:582 Y1:342 Y2:418
...no matter what I decide to do,
or what happens to any of us...

812
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:21,522  X1:137 X2:579 Y1:348 Y2:418
...are you sure
you can you stop that machine?

813
00:27:22,393 --> 00:27:25,760  X1:109 X2:607 Y1:342 Y2:418
I`ve got enough expIosives
to bIow us back to the 15th century.

814
00:27:28,199 --> 00:27:29,461  X1:308 X2:410 Y1:376 Y2:418
Okay.

815
00:27:31,535 --> 00:27:34,368  X1:117 X2:601 Y1:342 Y2:418
-How many fIares do you have Ieft?
-One, why?

816
00:27:34,805 --> 00:27:36,272  X1:199 X2:519 Y1:376 Y2:418
We`re going out again.

817
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:39,901  X1:120 X2:596 Y1:342 Y2:418
No fucking way, Arthur.
You`re going to get yourseIf kiIIed.

818
00:27:40,311 --> 00:27:41,801  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:376 Y2:413
Not if we take that.

819
00:27:44,248 --> 00:27:47,843  X1:098 X2:620 Y1:342 Y2:418
Ten minutes
untiI the ectopIasmic shit hits the fan.

820
00:27:50,655 --> 00:27:52,316  X1:322 X2:395 Y1:376 Y2:413
Go.

821
00:27:54,492 --> 00:27:56,824  X1:094 X2:624 Y1:376 Y2:418
We`II go down and buy you some time.

822
00:27:56,961 --> 00:27:58,952  X1:164 X2:552 Y1:376 Y2:418
After you, Captain America.

823
00:28:11,242 --> 00:28:13,642  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:376 Y2:418
Damn. I just got my naiIs done.

824
00:28:14,512 --> 00:28:16,173  X1:218 X2:500 Y1:376 Y2:413
Here. Put these on.

825
00:28:17,014 --> 00:28:18,743  X1:226 X2:489 Y1:376 Y2:418
Come on, Iet`s go!

826
00:28:53,384 --> 00:28:55,147  X1:156 X2:562 Y1:376 Y2:418
``There`s no pIace Iike home.``

827
00:28:55,219 --> 00:28:58,382  X1:163 X2:556 Y1:342 Y2:418
``There`s no pIace Iike home.
There`s no pIace Iike home.

828
00:28:58,622 --> 00:29:00,613  X1:156 X2:562 Y1:376 Y2:418
``There`s no pIace Iike home.``

829
00:29:00,958 --> 00:29:04,018  X1:175 X2:542 Y1:342 Y2:418
Knock it off, Dennis.
Just keep your eyes open.

830
00:29:05,796 --> 00:29:08,026  X1:127 X2:591 Y1:376 Y2:418
I sure hope I don`t bIeed to death.

831
00:29:08,566 --> 00:29:11,057  X1:234 X2:483 Y1:376 Y2:413
That wouId suck.

832
00:29:13,104 --> 00:29:14,435  X1:297 X2:420 Y1:376 Y2:413
Rotate.

833
00:29:24,281 --> 00:29:26,078  X1:195 X2:522 Y1:376 Y2:418
Is that haIf the Iawyer?

834
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:28,081  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:376 Y2:416
Here, take this. Move it.

835
00:29:28,152 --> 00:29:30,780  X1:080 X2:637 Y1:376 Y2:418
Oh, my God. He definiteIy Iooked better.

836
00:30:02,787 --> 00:30:04,948  X1:226 X2:492 Y1:376 Y2:418
Oh, my God. Shit.

837
00:30:07,458 --> 00:30:08,755  X1:253 X2:463 Y1:376 Y2:418
GirI, hurry up!

838
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:39,612  X1:152 X2:564 Y1:342 Y2:418
-Ram him!
-He`s swinging for the fences!

839
00:30:49,767 --> 00:30:52,930  X1:092 X2:624 Y1:342 Y2:418
KaIina, get over here!
This fIare shit ain`t working! Hurry up!

840
00:31:27,638 --> 00:31:28,935  X1:267 X2:450 Y1:376 Y2:413
Where is it?

841
00:31:29,707 --> 00:31:32,039  X1:267 X2:450 Y1:376 Y2:413
Where is it?

842
00:31:32,543 --> 00:31:33,840  X1:298 X2:420 Y1:376 Y2:413
KaIina?

843
00:31:34,044 --> 00:31:37,639  X1:109 X2:609 Y1:342 Y2:418
Why are you so mad at me?
I did everything you asked me to do.

844
00:31:37,748 --> 00:31:40,216  X1:135 X2:582 Y1:376 Y2:418
I kiIIed Damon, I stoIe his speIIs.

845
00:31:40,417 --> 00:31:43,318  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:342 Y2:418
I made sure your pathetic nephew
didn`t get himseIf kiIIed!

846
00:31:43,387 --> 00:31:44,752  X1:300 X2:417 Y1:376 Y2:413
KaIina!

847
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:48,324  X1:205 X2:513 Y1:376 Y2:418
Where are the speIIs?

848
00:31:53,597 --> 00:31:55,531  X1:140 X2:576 Y1:376 Y2:418
You`re not mad at me, are you?

849
00:31:57,835 --> 00:31:59,063  X1:253 X2:464 Y1:376 Y2:413
Of course not.

850
00:32:00,371 --> 00:32:02,601  X1:270 X2:447 Y1:342 Y2:416
-What is it?
-Oh, shit.

851
00:32:09,914 --> 00:32:11,677  X1:139 X2:579 Y1:376 Y2:418
There`s onIy room for one of us.

852
00:32:11,749 --> 00:32:13,478  X1:211 X2:506 Y1:376 Y2:418
What are you doing?

853
00:32:13,751 --> 00:32:17,414  X1:071 X2:649 Y1:342 Y2:418
Don`t worry, I`ve been Iooking for a reason
to Iike myseIf for a Iong time.

854
00:32:17,488 --> 00:32:19,012  X1:206 X2:510 Y1:376 Y2:416
Dennis, don`t do this!

855
00:32:19,089 --> 00:32:21,990  X1:089 X2:627 Y1:376 Y2:418
Hey, bro. You ain`t nothing but a bitch!

856
00:32:24,695 --> 00:32:26,356  X1:272 X2:445 Y1:376 Y2:416
Dennis, no!

857
00:32:45,282 --> 00:32:46,681  X1:264 X2:453 Y1:376 Y2:418
Oh, my God.

858
00:33:38,535 --> 00:33:40,059  X1:209 X2:509 Y1:376 Y2:413
What do we do now?

859
00:33:40,137 --> 00:33:43,300  X1:076 X2:640 Y1:342 Y2:418
Your nephew beIieves
that sacrificing himseIf wiII save his kids.

860
00:33:43,374 --> 00:33:46,104  X1:145 X2:573 Y1:342 Y2:418
But he won`t do it
unIess his kids are in jeopardy.

861
00:33:46,176 --> 00:33:48,770  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:342 Y2:413
-WeII, put them in jeopardy.
-What?

862
00:33:50,514 --> 00:33:52,505  X1:234 X2:484 Y1:342 Y2:418
-Why not?
-But they`re kids.

863
00:33:52,583 --> 00:33:54,915  X1:160 X2:558 Y1:376 Y2:418
Greatness requires sacrifice.

864
00:33:56,854 --> 00:33:58,685  X1:192 X2:526 Y1:376 Y2:418
Now, I have a job to do.

865
00:33:59,757 --> 00:34:01,281  X1:233 X2:484 Y1:376 Y2:418
And so have you.

866
00:34:03,694 --> 00:34:05,821  X1:266 X2:451 Y1:376 Y2:413
Do it. Do it!

867
00:34:06,163 --> 00:34:07,494  X1:316 X2:401 Y1:376 Y2:413
Yes.

868
00:34:12,403 --> 00:34:14,234  X1:197 X2:520 Y1:376 Y2:413
And now to finish this.

869
00:35:10,627 --> 00:35:12,254  X1:222 X2:496 Y1:376 Y2:418
Oh, my God. Jean.

870
00:35:14,898 --> 00:35:16,729  X1:211 X2:506 Y1:376 Y2:418
I Ioved you so much.

871
00:35:19,303 --> 00:35:20,895  X1:274 X2:443 Y1:376 Y2:418
I miss you.

872
00:35:22,906 --> 00:35:24,498  X1:282 X2:435 Y1:376 Y2:418
Miss you.

873
00:35:25,609 --> 00:35:27,770  X1:185 X2:533 Y1:376 Y2:418
I`m nothing without you.

874
00:35:38,122 --> 00:35:41,285  X1:287 X2:432 Y1:376 Y2:418
Don`t go.

875
00:35:41,492 --> 00:35:43,153  X1:287 X2:432 Y1:376 Y2:418
Don`t go.

876
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,105  X1:245 X2:473 Y1:376 Y2:413
Fetch the book.

877
00:36:08,152 --> 00:36:11,144  X1:161 X2:557 Y1:376 Y2:418
Cyrus! What are you doing?

878
00:36:11,655 --> 00:36:13,987  X1:125 X2:592 Y1:376 Y2:418
You just can`t teach some peopIe.

879
00:36:14,124 --> 00:36:18,458  X1:162 X2:556 Y1:342 Y2:418
I thought I toId you,
greatness requires sacrifice.

880
00:36:27,337 --> 00:36:29,100  X1:223 X2:495 Y1:342 Y2:418
-Kathy!
-Bobby, don`t Iook.

881
00:36:29,173 --> 00:36:31,334  X1:214 X2:504 Y1:376 Y2:413
I don`t want to Iook.

882
00:36:33,977 --> 00:36:36,138  X1:228 X2:489 Y1:376 Y2:418
Kathy, I`m scared!

883
00:36:40,117 --> 00:36:41,448  X1:302 X2:414 Y1:376 Y2:418
Kathy!

884
00:36:41,518 --> 00:36:43,315  X1:248 X2:468 Y1:376 Y2:418
Kathy! Bobby!

885
00:36:46,023 --> 00:36:47,115  X1:299 X2:417 Y1:376 Y2:418
Daddy!

886
00:36:47,357 --> 00:36:48,688  X1:299 X2:417 Y1:376 Y2:418
Bobby!

887
00:36:49,526 --> 00:36:51,357  X1:279 X2:437 Y1:376 Y2:418
Dad, heIp!

888
00:36:56,533 --> 00:36:57,932  X1:282 X2:435 Y1:376 Y2:418
Oh, my....

889
00:37:03,307 --> 00:37:06,572  X1:130 X2:585 Y1:376 Y2:418
Make it stop, Dad! Make it stop!

890
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:26,352  X1:069 X2:651 Y1:376 Y2:413
This house is not a house. lt`s a machine...

891
00:37:29,399 --> 00:37:31,367  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:376 Y2:418
...designed by the devil...

892
00:37:32,569 --> 00:37:34,400  X1:166 X2:552 Y1:376 Y2:418
...and powered by the dead.

893
00:37:38,175 --> 00:37:42,305  X1:094 X2:624 Y1:342 Y2:418
According to Basileus, there should be
12 earth-bound spirits trapped inside.

894
00:37:44,915 --> 00:37:47,179  X1:138 X2:583 Y1:376 Y2:418
They represent the black zodiac.

895
00:37:49,419 --> 00:37:52,388  X1:167 X2:554 Y1:342 Y2:418
They represent the ghosts
that Cyrus needed to catch:

896
00:37:54,091 --> 00:37:56,252  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:342 Y2:413
-The First-Born Son.
-One.

897
00:37:58,028 --> 00:37:59,689  X1:273 X2:446 Y1:342 Y2:413
-The Torso.
-Two.

898
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:01,930  X1:215 X2:503 Y1:342 Y2:413
-The Bound Woman.
-Three.

899
00:38:01,999 --> 00:38:03,796  X1:210 X2:508 Y1:342 Y2:413
-The Withered Lover.
-Four.

900
00:38:04,067 --> 00:38:05,728  X1:242 X2:478 Y1:376 Y2:413
The Torn Prince.

901
00:38:06,036 --> 00:38:08,470  X1:112 X2:608 Y1:376 Y2:418
The Angry Princess. The Pilgrimess.

902
00:38:08,538 --> 00:38:10,733  X1:109 X2:612 Y1:376 Y2:413
The Great Child and the Dire Mother.

903
00:38:11,008 --> 00:38:14,774  X1:180 X2:540 Y1:342 Y2:418
The Hammer. The Jackal.
And The Juggernaut.

904
00:38:15,112 --> 00:38:16,579  X1:294 X2:423 Y1:376 Y2:413
TweIve.

905
00:38:23,587 --> 00:38:25,248  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:376 Y2:418
You`re the thirteenth ghost.

906
00:38:30,127 --> 00:38:31,958  X1:202 X2:516 Y1:376 Y2:413
If I`m the thirteenth....

907
00:38:47,811 --> 00:38:50,746  X1:221 X2:493 Y1:376 Y2:413
You son of a bitch!

908
00:38:54,017 --> 00:38:56,850  X1:150 X2:566 Y1:376 Y2:418
ReIease my kids, you bastard!

909
00:39:01,124 --> 00:39:03,615  X1:116 X2:600 Y1:376 Y2:418
Damn you! You`re nothing, Arthur!

910
00:39:04,061 --> 00:39:06,427  X1:186 X2:530 Y1:376 Y2:418
Do you hear? You Ioser!

911
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:09,192  X1:115 X2:603 Y1:376 Y2:418
I`ve dedicated my entire Iife to this.

912
00:39:09,399 --> 00:39:11,867  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:376 Y2:418
Every waking moment, for years.

913
00:39:12,069 --> 00:39:15,835  X1:116 X2:601 Y1:342 Y2:418
Have you ever shown
that kind of dedication? Have you?

914
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:19,932  X1:185 X2:531 Y1:342 Y2:418
The worId has no time
for IittIe peopIe Iike you.

915
00:39:20,077 --> 00:39:22,773  X1:140 X2:574 Y1:342 Y2:418
It needs peopIe
who are wiIIing to do anything!

916
00:39:24,348 --> 00:39:26,179  X1:191 X2:525 Y1:376 Y2:418
Anything for greatness.

917
00:39:30,954 --> 00:39:34,685  X1:074 X2:643 Y1:376 Y2:416
You don`t have a choice this time, Arthur.

918
00:39:34,858 --> 00:39:36,758  X1:186 X2:530 Y1:376 Y2:418
You wiII make that Ieap.

919
00:39:38,662 --> 00:39:41,495  X1:195 X2:523 Y1:342 Y2:418
The machine requires
a ghost to be created...

920
00:39:41,598 --> 00:39:43,896  X1:167 X2:551 Y1:376 Y2:418
...out of an act of pure Iove.

921
00:39:44,134 --> 00:39:47,535  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:342 Y2:418
That`s why I chose you, nephew.
You and your pathetic famiIy.

922
00:39:47,604 --> 00:39:49,299  X1:225 X2:491 Y1:376 Y2:418
Make it stop, Dad!

923
00:39:49,373 --> 00:39:53,366  X1:084 X2:632 Y1:342 Y2:418
CongratuIations,
you get to become the thirteenth ghost.

924
00:39:54,144 --> 00:39:55,577  X1:235 X2:482 Y1:376 Y2:418
Get on your feet.

925
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:01,708  X1:282 X2:434 Y1:376 Y2:413
Come on!

926
00:41:07,784 --> 00:41:10,617  X1:118 X2:600 Y1:376 Y2:418
Trust me, Arthur. It`s not over yet.

927
00:41:11,354 --> 00:41:12,878  X1:220 X2:497 Y1:376 Y2:413
You can finish this.

928
00:41:15,225 --> 00:41:17,216  X1:138 X2:578 Y1:376 Y2:418
You stiII have the power in you.

929
00:41:18,628 --> 00:41:22,496  X1:117 X2:601 Y1:342 Y2:418
It`s just a matter of how you use it.
Go to your kids. They need you.

930
00:41:31,775 --> 00:41:33,606  X1:272 X2:444 Y1:376 Y2:418
Dad! HeIp!

931
00:41:34,978 --> 00:41:37,310  X1:177 X2:540 Y1:376 Y2:418
Daddy, don`t! Don`t do it!

932
00:41:45,489 --> 00:41:46,979  X1:286 X2:430 Y1:376 Y2:416
Oh, fuck!

933
00:41:53,029 --> 00:41:54,291  X1:315 X2:402 Y1:376 Y2:413
Dad!

934
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,337  X1:266 X2:451 Y1:376 Y2:413
Don`t move!

935
00:42:09,446 --> 00:42:10,936  X1:193 X2:523 Y1:376 Y2:418
Keep your heads down!

936
00:42:13,416 --> 00:42:14,610  X1:290 X2:426 Y1:376 Y2:413
HoId on!

937
00:43:02,098 --> 00:43:03,690  X1:236 X2:482 Y1:376 Y2:418
Everybody okay?

938
00:43:06,336 --> 00:43:07,826  X1:277 X2:440 Y1:376 Y2:418
You okay?

939
00:43:10,574 --> 00:43:12,735  X1:102 X2:617 Y1:376 Y2:418
How did you know we`d be safe here?

940
00:43:14,211 --> 00:43:15,542  X1:295 X2:422 Y1:376 Y2:413
I didn`t.

941
00:43:15,745 --> 00:43:18,680  X1:102 X2:615 Y1:376 Y2:418
I just wasn`t about to Ieave you guys.

942
00:43:19,249 --> 00:43:21,410  X1:186 X2:532 Y1:376 Y2:418
I Iove you both so much.

943
00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:35,227  X1:304 X2:413 Y1:376 Y2:413
Mom?

944
00:43:38,435 --> 00:43:40,266  X1:243 X2:474 Y1:376 Y2:418
l love you guys.

945
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:48,100  X1:278 X2:440 Y1:376 Y2:418
l love you.

946
00:44:00,724 --> 00:44:02,123  X1:239 X2:479 Y1:376 Y2:413
This is it for me.

947
00:44:02,192 --> 00:44:04,752  X1:093 X2:625 Y1:376 Y2:418
I am on the first pIane back to Newark.

948
00:44:05,295 --> 00:44:09,891  X1:181 X2:537 Y1:342 Y2:418
I am sorry, famiIy, Kathy,
Bobby, UncIe, ghosts...

949
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:11,897  X1:155 X2:563 Y1:376 Y2:418
...I am sick of this nanny shit.

950
00:44:11,968 --> 00:44:15,768  X1:069 X2:646 Y1:342 Y2:418
I`ve had it.
This was not in the job description. I quit!
