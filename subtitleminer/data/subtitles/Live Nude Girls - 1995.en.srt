00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,078
Hey, how many boyfriends
have you had?

3
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,073
Come on. Think about it really hard.

4
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,515
- 10.
- No. She's lying.

5
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,272
Give her a few seconds
to think something up.

6
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,112
- David's staring at you.
- Boys!

7
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,351
- David's staring at you.
- No. He's staring at me, you guys.

8
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,908
He's staring at me. Please admit it.
He's staring at me.

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,194
He's so cute.

10
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,555
If you were 16
and you were out on a date with him

11
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,710
- would you do it with him?
- That's gross!

12
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,869
It's not gross, Marcy.

13
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,076
Then you'll never have any kids, Rachel.

14
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,991
Yes, I will. I'll adopt them.

15
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,116
I'll just do it once, 
just to get pregnant.

16
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,156
Don't you have to do it, like, 
every night?

17
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,879
I love you. Kiss me.

18
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,439
I do, too!

19
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,755
- Gross.
- What?

20
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,273
Tina farted.

21
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,434
- Jill.
- The sitter came in an hour early.

22
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,637
- Great. Here, let me take this.
- Thank you. Hey!

23
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,554
- Come talk to me while I get dressed.
- Okay.

24
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,756
Where the hell are my shoes?

25
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,796
So how are you and Chris doing?

26
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,511
Well, it's weird. I feel really guilty,
but there's this guy at work

27
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,238
that I'm sort of attracted to.

28
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:25,996
- Seriously? Who is he?
- It's so stupid. He's my sous chef.

29
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,475
- Did anything happen?
- No, of course not.

30
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,757
It's just that Chris is so goddamn
possessive, it's making me crazy.

31
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,956
Listen, I wish Don was possessive.

32
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,635
- You look really pretty.
- Thanks.

33
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,550
Oh, this cake is gorgeous.

34
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,996
Chris stayed late at the bakery last night
to make it for the party.

35
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,798
- That's so sweet.
- Yeah.

36
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,476
Doesn't seem that long since we were
having Jamie's last bachelorette party.

37
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,879
It wasn't.

38
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,630
Can you cut some limes for me?

39
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,473
Can I give Tina Two a piece of cheese?

40
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,788
That is Tina Three.

41
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,192
I'm sorry. Hello, Tina Three. Oh,
you need a new pink bow, don't you?

42
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,713
Where's your sister?

43
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,758
Oh, probably terrorizing the staff
at Nordstrom's.

44
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,398
Have a knife?

45
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,274
How is it that somebody with an MBA
ended up being a personnel director?

46
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,557
I wish she'd just quit that job
or stop complaining.

47
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,036
Oh, do not tell her I'm pregnant.

48
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,394
Why?

49
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,710
She had to go to
two baby showers last week.

50
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,995
She almost slit her wrists.

51
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,435
She's already got
that old maid mentality.

52
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,432
- She's up to four packs now.
- You are so mean.

53
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,478
What are you talking about?
She's the judgemental one.

54
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,995
- You are too hard on her, though.
- Are you kidding?

55
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,469
She's picked on me
since the day I was born.

56
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,393
She got the Barbie Dream House.
I wasn't allowed to touch it.

57
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,710
She got the canopy bed.
I couldn't even sit on it.

58
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,472
She said my butt was stinky.

59
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,118
- Listen to you.
- What?

60
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,792
Hello! Anybody here?

61
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:51,794
- Speaking of stinky butts.
- We're back here, Rachel.

62
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,315
Somebody raided
the accessories department.

63
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:01,598
50% off with employee discount.
I hope you weren't talking about me.

64
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,917
- That's a bit paranoid isn't it?
- I brought my own pillow.

65
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,673
- You look great.
- Really? I'm exhausted.

66
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,317
- Did you start smoking again?
- Of course not.

67
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,789
- I took my last patch off a week ago.
- Your hair reeks.

68
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,552
Well, other people smoke
in the employee lounge.

69
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,393
- Is that my fault?
- All right. Fine. I just asked.

70
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:23,632
- Look at all these goodies!
- "Goodies." Oh, I hate that word.

71
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:28,191
- I'll make a note of that.
- Sorry. I'm... tired.

72
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,313
- How's Noah?
- Great.

73
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,192
- Don?
- Fabulous.

74
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,235
Good.

75
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,273
Why don't you two both go outside?
I'll bring some margaritas.

76
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,318
I want you both in a good mood
before Jamie gets here.

77
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,750
Please, she's really
looking forward to this.

78
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,354
- I'd love a drink.
- Ginger ale for me.

79
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,875
- That's a pretty blouse. Silk?
- Viscose.

80
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,750
- It's Italian.
- Oh.

81
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,439
It's old. I was gonna give it away.
Would you like it?

82
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:12,071
- No, thanks. It's more you.
- Just thought I'd ask.

83
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,950
You two look so pretty. 
Here. Move in.

84
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,799
Great.

85
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,794
- Where's Marcy?
- I don't know.

86
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,074
She's bringing guacamole.

87
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,559
She's probably in bed
with her house painter.

88
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,959
- What?
- Marcy's having a relationship

89
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,951
- with her house painter?
- No. She's just fucking him.

90
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,553
- But she's engaged to Mark.
- No, she's not.

91
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,709
- Not anymore.
- What happened?

92
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,075
She sent that painter over here
to give me an estimate.

93
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,593
She didn't tell me
she was sleeping with him.

94
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,874
They have wild, kinky sex.

95
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,757
- Marcy?
- What happened to Mark, Jill?

96
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,910
Oh, you guys are out here.

97
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,199
- Marcy.
- Marcy.

98
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,396
- What? What?
- Nothing.

99
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,959
- Are those new glasses?
- Great shoes. Great shoes.

100
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,029
- Thank you.
- They're really nice.

101
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,155
Hi.

102
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,310
- Let me get you a drink.
- Thanks. I could use one.

103
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,915
- What's wrong?
- It's kind of a long story.

104
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,035
So?

105
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,673
- Oh, thank you.
- Oh, wait.

106
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,229
You look so pretty in that dress.

107
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,714
Thanks.

108
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,638
So, I've sort of been,

109
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,072
well, seeing the guy
who painted my house.

110
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,230
- Really?
- Jill was just telling us.

111
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,598
- Jill?
- I didn't know it was a big secret.

112
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,715
So what's wrong?

113
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,030
I thought he was a really nice guy
at first, you know?

114
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,554
I mean, not exactly marriage material

115
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,394
but sweet and really, well, sexy.

116
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,518
Anyway, he started acting kind of 
weird the last week or so

117
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,999
and I finally had to tell him,

118
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,674
- "Look, Randy"...
- Oh, God, I hate that name, "Randy".

119
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,478
- It's so white trash.
- Yeah.

120
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,836
- He has a twin sister named Brandy.
- No, you've got to be kidding.

121
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,194
Anyway, anyway...

122
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,793
- This is good guacamole.
- Oh, thanks.

123
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,472
Anyway, so go on.
Finally you had to tell him...

124
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:51,075
Yeah, that he's a nice guy and all,
but he's not my boyfriend

125
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,355
- and he never will be.
- So what did he say?

126
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,112
I couldn't believe it. 
He just freaked out.

127
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,350
He's been acting
really possessive lately,

128
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,589
you know, like he owns me.

129
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,638
And all of a sudden he wants to know
everything I do every minute of the day.

130
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,711
And then yesterday,
I told him I felt like being alone

131
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,314
and he accused me
of seeing someone else.

132
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,630
Which I'm not, but it's
none of his business if I was, you know?

133
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,119
I mean I have no commitment to him.

134
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,395
And here's the really creepy part.

135
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,632
When I went out to my car last night,

136
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,280
I saw his El Camino
parked down the street

137
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,272
with him just sitting in it.

138
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,873
He was spying on me.

139
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,119
- A bee!
- It's all right. It's gone now.

140
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,155
What? I'm allergic.

141
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,639
So, did you call the police?

142
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,790
Oh, they won't do anything.

143
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:41,873
Remember that woman who reported
that her ex-husband was stalking her?

144
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,395
Then he massacred the whole family
at the barbecue.

145
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,233
I mean, the police didn't do anything
until after he slaughtered them.

146
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,629
Oh, my God. I am so stupid.

147
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,078
I mean, why did I ever get involved with
him? I always pick the wrong people.

148
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,229
Is he cute?

149
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,629
Wait. I have a picture of him.

150
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,153
- What?
- You photographed him?

151
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,468
No.

152
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,352
You know, at first,
I thought he was really sexy,

153
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,272
but now he looks
kind of psychotic to me.

154
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,793
You know, kind of Robert De Niro-ish.

155
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,838
Will somebody please
tell me what happened with Mark?

156
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,509
Didn't I tell you? We broke up.

157
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,473
- Why?
- Oh, it's such a terrible story.

158
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,590
- Oh, my God.
- He puts his picture on everything,

159
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,514
his invoice, his business cards.
It's even on his El Camino.

160
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,589
It's true.

161
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:28,753
He looks a little cross-eyed.
Sort of inbred. Did he go to college?

162
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,916
Well, at least you didn't marry Mark.

163
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,151
I mean, look at Jamie. Three marriages,
and she's just now getting it right.

164
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,151
Yeah, but at least she went out
and found a better guy.

165
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,514
Let's just hope she found
a better dress, too.

166
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,589
No kidding!

167
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,228
Jerome's a doll, though.

168
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,880
She says they have great sex,
said they do it constantly.

169
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,599
Oh, you guys,
I had this picture blown up of her.

170
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,910
I took it at their engagement dinner.

171
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,470
I don't know why, but I have a
real hard time imagining Jerome naked.

172
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,028
- Don't strain yourself.
- She really looks great.

173
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,032
She's got the perfect body.
Look at those shoulders.

174
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,310
Oh, you know, I was watching TV
late one night last week,

175
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,389
because I couldn't sleep,

176
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,436
and that movie came on,
the one she did in Mexico...

177
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,238
- <i>Tropical Maniac.</i>
- Oh, that's right. That's right.

178
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,436
So, there's Jamie
and she's standing there on the beach

179
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,273
in a requisite bikini,
holding a machine gun. I'm telling you.

180
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,952
She never gets sent out
for any good parts.

181
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,155
What good parts?

182
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,593
There are no good parts for women.

183
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,591
Do you think it bothers her
that Jerome's going bald?

184
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,592
- She thinks it's sexy.
- I don't know, I like a little hair.

185
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,389
Well, it's a good thing, considering
Don has it covering his entire body.

186
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,357
I'm telling you, the last time
he was over here swimming

187
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,237
I thought I was gonna have to change
our pool filter.

188
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,719
Oh, now who's mean?

189
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,189
Jerry seems very comfortable
with his masculinity.

190
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,396
Yeah. I guess, considering.

191
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,712
- What?
- Considering what?

192
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,757
- What?
- I can't tell.

193
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,875
- Oh, come on.
- No, I can't.

194
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,393
Jamie made me swear on my life.

195
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,357
- It's really not that big a deal.
- Something about Jerome?

196
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,873
- Maybe.
- Jill, now you have to tell us.

197
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,036
He only has one testicle.

198
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,278
Isn't that funny?

199
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:56,114
And he still has some semen,
so it's not like he's sterile 
or anything.

200
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,508
Oh, my God.

201
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,558
And he's certainly not impotent,
but can you imagine?

202
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,749
Isn't that funny?

203
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,592
Oh, it must look so weird.

204
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,470
And he hates
for anyone to know about it.

205
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,630
He didn't tell Jamie for the longest time.

206
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,233
Wasn't it obvious?

207
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,959
No. She just thought
he had really teeny balls.

208
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:20,111
Anyway, do not repeat that information
about Jerome, please.

209
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,429
I mean, it's not like it slows them down.
They have wild, kinky sex.

210
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,076
- You say that about everybody.
- Like who else?

211
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:37,637
- Jesus, Jill.
- I really didn't tell them anything.

212
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,513
Never mind.

213
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,192
So what do Jamie and Jerome do
that's so wild and kinky?

214
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,239
Well, she would probably
tell you this herself...

215
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,110
What the hell's going on?

216
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,595
- Jamie.
- Jamie.

217
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,874
The front door's locked.

218
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:55,509
- I rang the doorbell forever.
- I'm sorry. We didn't hear you.

219
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,035
Wait, wait, wait.

220
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,997
Oh, my goodness.

221
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,553
- Honey.
- You are so skinny, I hate you.

222
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,313
- I can't eat when I'm nervous.
- Hi, bride.

223
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,390
How come you get three husbands
and I don't get any?

224
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,232
Well, you can have the last one.

225
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,719
For that matter, you can have this one.

226
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,109
- What's wrong?
- Jerry and I had a fight.

227
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,834
- You're under a lot of stress.
- Oh, no, no.

228
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,435
This was a real, real nasty one,
and I'm still mad. I never leave mad.

229
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,919
- What happened?
- Well, you know,

230
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,195
Jerry's having
his little bachelor party tonight.

231
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,669
You know, just a couple of
wacky systems analysts sitting around

232
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,433
playing pool in some billiard parlour
in Pasadena.

233
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:32,752
Well, this one guy who's with him,
Dave, he hired a stripper.

234
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,876
Now, Jerry didn't know about it
until tonight

235
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,315
but he doesn't understand
why I'm upset.

236
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,799
Well, it's not like
anything's going to happen.

237
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,757
Look, I worked for
one of those stripper companies

238
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,400
in my pathetic early twenties,
I know what goes on.

239
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,391
Yeah, but you said it wasn't his idea.

240
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,436
No, but he should tell them
that he doesn't want it

241
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,114
and make them cancel
if he had any balls.

242
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,477
I don't blame you. I'd be furious.

243
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,675
Besides, it's really tacky.

244
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,797
Yeah, I know. I mean, he should
respect my feelings. He should.

245
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,916
He should respect them
and if it bugs me that much,

246
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,274
then you know, it's not worth it.

247
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,588
Don't you trust him?

248
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:06,150
- I don't trust anybody I'm in love with.
- Oh, Jamie, please.

249
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,229
You don't actually think

250
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,629
that Jerry's going to have sex
with some bimbo at a pool hall?

251
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,789
He's not the type.

252
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,791
But he's going to fantasise about it.

253
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,792
I think it is really twisted that
three days before he marries me

254
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,872
he's off there staring at another woman,
thinking about screwing her.

255
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,599
- But that's not the point.
- No, it is the point. Aren't I enough?

256
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,875
You don't stop fantasising
once you get married. Believe me.

257
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,474
Well, I just want him
to fantasise about me.

258
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,869
Okay. You want me to call up some
big, greasy hunk

259
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,837
and have him come over here
and dance around in a Speedo?

260
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,912
No, no, no. I would hate that.
Men are so simplistic.

261
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,639
It takes a little more to excite me

262
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,915
than some naked moron
dancing around for money.

263
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,310
It doesn't take a stripper for him
to fantasise about somebody else.

264
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,676
The first thing that most men do
when they see an attractive woman

265
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,318
is imagine her naked.

266
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,708
I read in my psych class that a man
thinks about sex every 12 seconds.

267
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,717
How do they get anything done?

268
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,518
I wonder how many erections
do they have a day?

269
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,635
Hundreds.

270
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,679
What ever made me think that
I could be in another relationship?

271
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,000
I mean, I am obviously too neurotic.

272
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,229
I'm not gonna go through with it.

273
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,276
A lot of people
stop their weddings at the last minute.

274
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,510
- Jamie...
- No, I don't wanna talk about it anymore.

275
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,828
Fuck it!

276
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,758
Look, I'm sorry.

277
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,273
I'm cold.

278
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,638
- We're having pizza.
- I love your pizza.

279
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,672
Well, let's have pizza.

280
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,432
- I want some pizza.
- Pig out.

281
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,989
Isn't it beautiful today?

282
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,875
- Hamburger?
- No.

283
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,159
Jerry is crazy about you.

284
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,913
- Yeah.
- Just like Bob was crazy about me?

285
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,759
- Bob was an asshole.
- Bob was an asshole.

286
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,195
Thanks all of you for telling me that
before I married him.

287
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,759
Hey, I told you. You didn't listen.

288
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,149
- You hate everybody.
- I like Jerry.

289
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,717
- Got any ginger ale?
- You just told me that you'd be furious.

290
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,792
Well, yeah, but I mean, that doesn't
mean I don't think he's a good guy.

291
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,836
He's not like Bob or anything.

292
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,592
This smells like feet. Smell that.

293
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,999
Yeah, well, I picked Bob.

294
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,399
I picked Victor, for that matter.

295
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,835
- Hey, did you bring your dress?
- How can I trust myself?

296
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,751
- Did you bring your dress?
- Yeah, it's in the car.

297
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,637
- Somebody might steal it.
- Who cares?

298
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,029
- Is it white?
- No. It's bone.

299
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,951
I was just thinking how funny it would be

300
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,110
if we all just, you know,
wore the same bridesmaid's dresses

301
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,270
- from your last wedding.
- Oh, God.

302
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,789
I let my goddaughter
cut mine up for doll clothes.

303
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,917
- I burnt mine.
- Oh, come on. They weren't that bad.

304
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,275
Are you kidding? With those sashes?

305
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,749
We looked like we were on <i>Hee Haw.</i>

306
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,308
Oh, God, they were perfect for the time.
Come on.

307
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,755
They were really bad.
I was just looking at the pictures.

308
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,956
You have the...
Oh, my God. I threw mine out.

309
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:51,077
- Go get them.
- Get them. Come on, Georgina. Please.

310
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,434
- Please, please.
- Please, please.

311
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,397
Okay. Somebody make
another pitcher of margaritas.

312
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,436
I'll make the margaritas.

313
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,669
What?

314
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,228
Georg has a crush
on a guy she works with.

315
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,594
- What?
- What?

316
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,314
- She told me. He's her sous chef.
- What about Chris?

317
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,312
I don't know.
I'm just telling you what she told me.

318
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,869
Wow.

319
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,429
Hey.

320
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,711
- What you doing?
- Sorry. Didn't mean to wake you.

321
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,239
Hop in a minute.

322
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,709
No. Chris, I can't.
I can't. Everybody's here.

323
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:52,873
- So? It's more exciting that way.
- No. Really, I can't.

324
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,754
Excuse me for wanting a little affection.

325
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,032
Well, I think it's a little unrealistic of you

326
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,758
to expect me to
just jump into bed with you

327
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,035
when all my friends are here.

328
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,159
Are you mad at me or something?
I mean...

329
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,069
I'm just preoccupied, you know.

330
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,276
I'm trying to throw a bachelorette party

331
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,430
for somebody who just decided
not to get married.

332
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,589
Why?

333
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,917
She's mad at Jerry and, I don't know,
I think she's just scared.

334
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,713
She's such a drama queen, man.

335
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,633
You don't even know
the whole story, Chris.

336
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,229
You know, she's genuinely upset.

337
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:32,348
I wish you were as understanding
with me as you are with your friends.

338
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,713
I'm just trying to make everybody happy.

339
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,235
Will you come out and join us soon?

340
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,950
I don't really feel like being around
everybody right now.

341
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,508
I'm not feeling that great.

342
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,999
Well, get some rest.

343
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,193
Here it is.

344
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,994
Look at this.

345
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,554
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

346
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,433
- Look how fat I am.
- You look stunning in that dress.

347
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,431
Why did you make me wear pink?

348
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,233
I can't believe it.

349
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,595
- Look how small your boobs are.
- I know.

350
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:26,199
God, look at my ugly hair.
Look at my ugly husband.

351
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,315
He wasn't ugly.

352
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,913
- Yes, he was.
- Yes, he was.

353
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,434
God, he was an alcoholic leprechaun.

354
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,830
You know, my taste in men stinks.
My taste in dresses stinks.

355
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,956
I just have terrible judgement
about everything.

356
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,837
No, not anymore.

357
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:42,436
You wouldn't marry an abusive liar
like Victor now, would you?

358
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,999
She wouldn't
have married him in the first place

359
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,877
if she'd known he was already married
to someone else.

360
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,951
Come on, don't remind me.
The only reason I married him

361
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,190
is because he was
so completely different than Victor.

362
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:53,477
That's why I'm fucking Randy. I mean,
he's even more fucked up than Mark.

363
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:57,075
- I do everything ass backwards.
- What did she just say?

364
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,912
Something about
Mark fucking her in the ass.

365
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,558
I didn't know Mark had it in him.

366
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,677
- I didn't think Bob was that bad.
- Oh, God. He was withholding and cold.

367
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,751
I'd rather be screamed at than ignored.

368
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,717
Well, Jerry certainly doesn't ignore you.

369
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,439
Yeah. He worships you. It's sickening.

370
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:13,478
- Is that my car alarm?
- There goes your dress.

371
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,158
Jesus.

372
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,348
Wow, I guess she still wants her dress.

373
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,117
- Here it is.
- It's pretty.

374
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,633
- Nice.
- It's beautiful.

375
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,233
It's not bone, it's champagne.

376
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,232
- I hope I can return it. I had it altered.
- Try it on.

377
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,117
I mean,
since we're not gonna get to see it later.

378
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,633
- Yeah.
- Come on.

379
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,392
- Just try it on.
- Put it on.

380
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,079
Try it on.

381
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,829
Okay.

382
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:05,272
This is just her insecurity
getting the best of her.

383
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:09,235
I mean, after all, she's gotten
all her validation from her looks

384
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,709
and now she's getting older.

385
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,718
Maybe she's just
having second thoughts about him.

386
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,871
I remember waking up
and finding Don totally repulsive

387
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,188
right before we got married

388
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,840
and then I accused him
of not loving me.

389
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,229
- That's awful.
- It's normal.

390
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,591
What are you guys whispering about?

391
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:30,433
Just wondering
if you invited Bob to the wedding.

392
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,273
Very funny.

393
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,911
Did I tell you that I found out that
he did get married again?

394
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,230
That explains
that stupid annulment attempt.

395
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,309
What?

396
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,676
Yeah. I get this letter from his priest
asking me to sign something

397
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,910
that says that we were never married
in the eyes of God

398
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,036
because we didn't have
a Catholic wedding.

399
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,759
- What a hypocrite.
- What did you say?

400
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,109
Well, I said,

401
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,352
"As long as you're having
my marriage annulled,

402
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,954
"can I have my herpes annulled, too?"

403
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,995
- Bob gave you herpes?
- Yeah. Ironic, huh?

404
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,956
After all those sleaze bags
that I slept with in my twenties,

405
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:08,032
and then I get it from
my boring little ex-husband.

406
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,071
Oh, that's beautiful.

407
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,834
- You look beautiful.
- So beautiful.

408
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,076
Oh, wait! I forgot my shoes.

409
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:27,672
I am not accusing you of anything!
I asked you one simple question!

410
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,512
Well, I'm sick of
your goddamn questions!

411
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,670
I saw you talking to her! I saw you!

412
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,752
Georgina, your neighbours
are about to kill each other.

413
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,797
I would rather talk to her than you,
goddamn it.

414
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,518
- She's in her underwear.
- Fuck you!

415
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,438
- Oh, my God. She just slapped him.
- Good. He's a pig.

416
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,318
- How do you know?
- You can tell by looking at him.

417
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,757
- I'm sick of you! Stop it!
- Bitch!

418
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:49,877
I just wanna talk to you!
God, what is your problem?

419
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:53,270
- I said I'm sorry! Don't go! Please!
- Get away from me.

420
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,920
I wanna talk to you. Stay here.

421
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,877
- Get away!
- Let him go!

422
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,952
- No! No!
- Get off my goddamn car!

423
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,031
Stay here! I just wanna talk to you!

424
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,478
No! I love you!

425
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,999
- She's so desperate.
- She is crazy.

426
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,036
They do this all the time.

427
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,952
That's marriage for you.

428
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,634
- My marriage isn't like that.
- Are you happily married, Jill?

429
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,438
Tell me honestly, are you?

430
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,079
She's never happy.

431
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,589
It has nothing to do with her marriage.

432
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,433
Jamie, for God's sakes.

433
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,670
You don't understand. I've done that.

434
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,398
- When?
- With Bob.

435
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,913
What did you do?

436
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:35,352
Well, it was just the lowest point
in my whole life.

437
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,589
<i>Bob had moved out, and there I was</i>

438
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,511
<i>holed up in our newly decorated house</i>

439
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,831
<i>which, by that time,</i>
<i>seemed like Amityville.</i>

440
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,310
<i>He called to say that he was coming by</i>
<i>to pick up some of his stuff.</i>

441
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,516
<i>I don't know what I was thinking but</i>

442
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,429
<i>I had it in my head I would seduce him</i>

443
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,192
<i>and he would want me back.</i>

444
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,759
Bob.

445
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,832
- What are you doing here?
- I'm taking my pots.

446
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,275
What?

447
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,313
The pots are mine.
The plants are yours.

448
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,915
Bob, the plants are gonna die.

449
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,118
- Get some new pots.
- Have you lost your mind?

450
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,312
Bob, look at me.

451
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:23,354
What are you doing outside
in your underwear?

452
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,749
- Go inside.
- I can't believe this.

453
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,149
You don't even come in and say hello.

454
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,713
The neighbours can see you.

455
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,869
Bob.

456
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,597
Go inside. I'll be in in a minute.

457
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,314
Honey, don't be like this. Talk to me.

458
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,879
I've said everything.

459
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,079
Why are you running around like that?
Put some clothes on.

460
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:49,436
Give it to me.
You've broken the bloody flag!

461
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,717
Jesus. Jesus, Bob.
You said we were gonna be friends.

462
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,074
So, how's work?

463
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:03,795
Fine. They're doing a movie
of <i>Hogan's Heroes</i> and I got a call-back.

464
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,074
That's great.

465
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,198
Bob, honey.

466
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,952
- Jamie, stop it.
- I miss you.

467
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,994
I'm late.

468
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,395
I don't understand
how you can just suddenly hate me.

469
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,790
I don't hate you.
I don't feel anything for you at all.

470
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,993
Yes, you do!

471
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:45,555
- Haven't you any pride?
- Bob, Bob.

472
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,155
Bob?

473
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,868
- Hi.
- Who are you?

474
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,113
I'm Jeff from Greenpeace.

475
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,394
"You might have heard about us.

476
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:19,075
"We are the largest
environmental organisation in the world.

477
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:23,677
"We are famous for our work with
whales, seals and ocean pollution."

478
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,797
And I live up in the green house
at the top of the street.

479
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,919
- My mom's at a neighbourhood watch.
- Right.

480
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,879
"Did you know
that whales are still being hunted

481
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,632
"in certain unpatrolled waters

482
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,438
"and brutally slaughtered?"

483
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,798
It's okay though.

484
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,953
Ma'am, you...

485
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,076
Ma'am, contributions...

486
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,276
"Contributions of $25 or more

487
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:00,990
"from generous people like you help us
stop the useless and cruel clubbing

488
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,350
"of innocent baby harp seals

489
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,591
"which are primarily used
to make cheap"...

490
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,999
These cheap key chains.

491
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,719
Stop, stop. Come on in.
I'll write you a cheque.

492
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,630
Let me get my purse.

493
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,631
Okay. I'm gonna find it.

494
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,751
Oh, I remember your mom now.
Jackie, right?

495
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,592
- Janet.
- Right.

496
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:43,235
Damn it, where is it?
This place is such a mess.

497
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,359
Excuse me.

498
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,718
Here I am, wandering around like this.

499
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:54,033
Are you all right?
You seem a little bummed.

500
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,758
You could say that.

501
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,754
That's too bad.

502
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:04,917
You look really nice
in that thing, anyway.

503
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,439
Thank you.

504
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,272
There's my purse.

505
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,393
- Okay.
- Could you hand it to me?

506
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,029
Sure.

507
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:31,193
- Is "Greenpeace" one word?
- Yeah. Here.

508
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,788
Here.

509
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,599
Thanks. That's very generous of you.

510
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,436
Look, do you want to
get something to eat or something...

511
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,159
That's very sweet of you,

512
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,590
but you better get back to your work.

513
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,795
Yeah.

514
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,988
Look, have a nice evening.

515
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:21,119
- Thanks. Say hello to your mom.
- Okay.

516
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,555
Wow.

517
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,154
You actually said that,
"Say hi to your mom"?

518
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,673
Can you believe it?

519
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,551
Get off my goddamn car, Kim!

520
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,155
- I love you!
- Kim, get in the house!

521
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,390
- Oh, my God!
- What?

522
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,833
The pizzas!

523
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:51,878
- Oh, shit.
- Shit.

524
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,195
Oh, no!

525
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,633
Put it out.

526
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:00,518
Oh, no. What a waste.

527
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,669
They're horrible.

528
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:02,909
So what? We'll get takeout.

529
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,718
No, but these would've been
so much better.

530
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,119
You better change out of that dress.

531
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,714
- Was the sex good?
- Yeah. Untie me.

532
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,672
You know,
it was like when you're starving

533
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:14,196
and you want a big, greasy hamburger,
but, you know, later you feel sick.

534
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,157
That's so hot to
have a young, beautiful boy

535
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,470
totally dependent on you
to tell him what to do.

536
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:22,599
- This guy knew what to do, believe me.
- I'd like a young boy on my pizza.

537
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:26,036
- But will a young boy like you?
- Hey, I'm not dead yet.

538
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:32,799
You know, I remember freaking out
right before I married Don

539
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,469
because I would never
be able to have sex with anybody else

540
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:38,438
for the rest of my life,
let alone kiss anybody.

541
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,678
- Do you think that's what's scaring you?
- No, I've kissed enough people.

542
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:45,833
Besides, I don't feel restricted with
Jerry. I mean, he's very experimental.

543
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,599
You ready
to give somebody like that up?

544
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:53,309
He's probably off experimenting
with some sleazy stripper right now.

545
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,950
So how much you think
that jukebox takes in?

546
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,110
- Per night or per month?
- Whatever.

547
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:02,239
Well, you figure four songs for a dollar,
song's three, four minutes long.

548
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,756
- It's active six hours a night.
- It's about 100 songs an evening.

549
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,751
Is that a Wednesday night
or a Saturday night?

550
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,398
We're talking aggregate.
We're talking a whole week.

551
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,914
- Nobody said aggregate.
- We're speaking aggregate.

552
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,959
Check it out.

553
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,758
$132.50 a week.

554
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,357
You know who was really kinky

555
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,998
- was Jay.
- Jay?

556
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,991
He was the first person
who ever spanked me.

557
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,957
Oh, Jesus.
Do we really have to hear this?

558
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,519
It was so much fun.

559
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,874
The big jerk. I still hate him.

560
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,359
Why don't you call him
and hang up on him?

561
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,908
I can't.
I drove him to an unlisted number.

562
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,959
Are you serious?
Jill, that is so immature.

563
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,834
What did he do to you?

564
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,388
For one thing, he tried to have
a three-way with me and Jamie.

565
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,994
When we said no, he broke up with me
and tried to go out with Jamie.

566
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,752
- True.
- I didn't know that.

567
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:50,196
What made Jay think you guys
would have a three-way with him?

568
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,032
You two are so coy.

569
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:54,868
What?

570
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,871
- Nothing.
- What?

571
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:00,032
No, it was just something that happened
once when we were both at UCLA.

572
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,269
- It was stupid.
- Stupid.

573
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,396
- I've heard this story.
- How come I didn't hear it?

574
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:06,711
You were at Mount Holypoke,
or whatever that hoity-toity school was.

575
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,917
Hey, didn't you have
any nubile lesbian experiences there?

576
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,151
Shut up! Yeah, sure. You know I didn't.
Stop changing the subject.

577
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,037
What happened when you guys
were at UCLA?

578
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,509
- It's too personal.
- Now, that's a first.

579
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,557
- Come on, tell!
- No, it was stupid.

580
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,392
- I'll tell.
- You slut.

581
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,071
We were living in that building in Palms.

582
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,754
And Jamie was dating
this guy from USC...

583
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,751
Well, she wasn't dating him.
She was exploiting him.

584
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,910
Come on, he was cute,
but nobody you'd ever fall in love with.

585
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,673
<i>So, it didn't matter. It was the '70s.</i>
<i>There was no AIDS.</i>

586
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,230
<i>Everybody was fucking each other</i>
<i>and wearing too much lip gloss.</i>

587
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,560
<i>He looked kind of like</i>
<i>a Jewish Jim Morrison.</i>

588
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,639
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, shit!

589
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,789
Shit.

590
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:42,313
<i>I can't believe</i>
<i>you guys had a three-way.</i>

591
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,189
Was it great?

592
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,919
No, it was stupid.
We knew each other too well.

593
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,797
It was kind of incestuous.

594
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,112
What ever happened to him?

595
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,960
He's an agent with
the William Morris Agency.

596
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,873
Rachel, can I borrow your comb?

597
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,269
God, I remember, we had to go to
Frederick's of Hollywood

598
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,429
to get those garter belts.

599
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:05,193
You couldn't even get, like, sexy lingerie
in department stores then.

600
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,033
- Who even wears garter belts anymore?
- I do.

601
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,348
You slut.

602
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,318
You know what I hate
is that cheesy lingerie catalogue.

603
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,992
I know.
They're all air-brushed and perfect.

604
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,718
- No one looks like that.
- I do.

605
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:19,156
Those perfect little models with those
teddies on that nobody ever wears.

606
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,674
There's never a drop of discharge
on them.

607
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,473
It makes me feel so inadequate.

608
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,393
Do you remember when we talked Mom
into buying that first black bra?

609
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,789
Oh, God, she thought it was so racy.

610
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,998
That was the time
we went shopping for your first bra.

611
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,548
- I was so jealous of you.
- I developed first.

612
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:38,154
- You're older.
- Not by much.

613
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,349
What?

614
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,556
- We tried...
- What?

615
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,471
Come on, spit it out.

616
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,676
We finally convinced her
to try a tampon.

617
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,194
And she didn't know that she was
supposed to take the applicator out.

618
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,316
So she left it in. And she came out
and she sat on the couch,

619
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,675
and then she shot six feet in the air.

620
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:03,590
- Jill, Jill.
- What is that?

621
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:08,229
It's the sound my mother makes
when she comes.

622
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,314
- You heard her?
- She heard her mother?

623
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,559
Oh, my God, what if it's Randy?

624
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,154
- Oh, Marcy, for God's sake.
- Relax.

625
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,992
Don't open the door.

626
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,315
Sorry.

627
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,391
It's the pizza.

628
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,234
- Good, I'm starving.
- I'm stuffed.

629
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,038
Let me get you some money.

630
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,149
- Hi.
- Hi.

631
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:43,671
Oh, my God. Don't let Jamie near him.

632
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,718
- Is this a joke? Are you a stripper?
- Pardon?

633
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,916
Don't listen to her. Here.

634
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,631
- Keep the change.
- Thanks.

635
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,315
- Guys having a party?
- No, Jamie's getting married.

636
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,833
- No, I'm not.
- Third time.

637
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:57,909
Thanks, Jill.

638
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,516
Wait a minute. I know you.
You were in <i>Cadet Academy.</i>

639
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:07,909
- Am I right? That was you, right?
- Yeah, I'm afraid it was. Yeah.

640
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,834
Shut up.

641
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,639
You looked so cute in that uniform.
You were my favourite cadet.

642
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,039
Gee, thanks.

643
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,391
Well, hey, congratulations.

644
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,991
- Thanks.
- See you.

645
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,429
Bye.

646
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:29,159
- Oh, my God! He was cute.
- Yeah, like a Michelangelo.

647
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,389
I need to pee.

648
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:35,708
You see?
I bet you had a fantasy going about him.

649
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,915
No, I didn't.

650
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,037
I can admire somebody's looks
without having to see them naked.

651
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,395
- I'd like to see him naked.
- What?

652
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,831
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Club soda and salt. Quick!

653
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,755
Hey.

654
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,879
Calm down, it's just me.

655
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,552
I'm sorry. I came out the wrong door.

656
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:59,189
- I'm sorry. I forgot you were in here.
- Nice dress.

657
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,153
Oh, thanks. Thanks.

658
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:04,872
- It's from Loehmann's.
- Loehmann's?

659
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,918
Oh, God. My mom used to
take me there when I was little.

660
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,036
She still thinks
those open changing rooms

661
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,792
are the cause of me being a lesbian.

662
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,558
Are you serious?

663
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,189
No.

664
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,958
I better get back.

665
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,514
Yeah, right. Okay.

666
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,996
Don't worry. We got it out.

667
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,516
We really did. See, it'll never show.

668
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,556
Besides, it's right where
you hold your flowers.

669
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,437
I mean, you know, if...

670
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:47,270
It's just another sign.

671
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:51,519
- Jamie, don't be ridiculous.
- What are you doing?

672
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,591
- I don't eat cheese.
- Since when?

673
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,319
After I broke up with Mark.
Got a colonic.

674
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,830
Mark used to tell me I have these
saddle bags and a Christmas package.

675
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,672
Now what is a Christmas package?

676
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,194
That bulge that starts at your pubic hair.

677
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,918
Mark used to call it
my Christmas package.

678
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,752
What a jerk. You have a great body.

679
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,559
Thank you. It doesn't matter.
Now if anybody tells me I'm fat,

680
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,198
I just feel like killing myself.

681
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:14,032
I know what you mean.

682
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,997
I can't even masturbate when I feel fat.

683
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,479
Everything with you
always comes back to sex.

684
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,391
You know when I hate myself,
I still masturbate

685
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,993
but I have really masochistic fantasies.

686
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,958
You see? You think you're gonna stop
doing that just 'cause you get married?

687
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:26,998
No, but they're abstract.
They're not about anybody in particular.

688
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,832
I went out with
this really smug French guy once

689
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,478
who thought
he knew everything about women.

690
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,754
I gotta pee now.

691
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:34,149
And he insisted that
all women have one fantasy.

692
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:39,430
A man comes home, he brings roses
and champagne to his woman,

693
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,919
then he tells her that he loves her...

694
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,639
- Are you sure he wasn't Italian?
- He was European.

695
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,676
He tells her that he loves her

696
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,479
and she's the most beautiful thing
in the world.

697
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,034
- And that's it.
- Sounds good to me.

698
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:54,954
I hate roses.
My fantasies are so much more explicit.

699
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,758
I mean, I disgust myself sometimes.

700
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:02,637
Did you guys read that Nancy Friday
book <i>My Secret Garden of Fantasies?</i>

701
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,119
I read that.

702
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:08,473
It's broken into all kinds of categories,
you know, sadomasochism and incest.

703
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,869
There's even an animal category.

704
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,908
You know, Victor tried to hump
his cocker spaniel, Lucky,

705
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,231
- when he was little.
- No! Did he really?

706
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,719
- That's disgusting.
- Yuck!

707
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,836
- What?
- Tina farted!

708
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,990
You know, I remember
that Nancy Friday book.

709
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,753
There was this nun fantasy in it
that was really perverse.

710
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:32,355
Please don't say anything about a nun.
There's nothing sexy about a nun.

711
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:35,876
Come on. I'd like to look up
some nun's habit and pleasure her.

712
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:39,270
I did a nun once. An ex-nun.

713
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:42,438
And she lost her virginity
to her mother superior.

714
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,669
Some of my fantasies are so weird.

715
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,435
- I wonder where they come from.
- Twisted childhoods.

716
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,670
You didn't have a twisted childhood.

717
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:53,957
I always feel guilty
after my masochistic fantasies.

718
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:57,316
I don't know. What do you do
when you're politically correct

719
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,391
but your masturbation fantasies aren't?

720
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:02,278
- I just hate any kind of pain.
- It's not about pain.

721
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,713
I'm sorry.

722
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:06,110
- I didn't know you were still in here.
- It's all yours.

723
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,953
I got something on my shirt.
I gotta go change.

724
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:18,349
- I knew it! You are smoking again.
- Mind your own business!

725
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:19,953
- This is my first one in six months.
- Oh, God.

726
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:22,554
I've had a very long stressful day
and it's not easy being around you.

727
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:23,834
Your breath stinks.
Oh, what? What did I do?

728
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,148
Just because
I don't want to take care of you

729
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,231
when you're riddled with emphysema...

730
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:30,278
- Guys, you're gonna wake up Chris.
- I'm awake.

731
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:31,475
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

732
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:33,278
Sorry, honey.

733
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,798
- Why didn't you lock the door?
- Jill, stop screaming.

734
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:39,711
I didn't know you would come
barging in without knocking.

735
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,075
Do you remember
how Desi used to spank Lucy?

736
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:43,195
Yeah!

737
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,475
I thought that I would grow up to
have a husband who spanked me.

738
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:48,313
Oh! Do you know
what used to get to me was Catwoman.

739
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,914
Remember... Remember she used to tie
people up?

740
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,638
I told my parents
that when I watched that,

741
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,073
it made me feel all funny inside.

742
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:55,957
They made me stop watching it.

743
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:58,270
Rachel and I have these cousins,
twin boys.

744
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:00,669
And whenever they came over,
we used to play this secret game

745
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:01,829
where they tied me up.

746
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,876
I loved it! "Let me go, let me go!"

747
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:06,599
Michael and Mitchell used to tie you up?
Where was I?

748
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:09,877
I don't know. You were amusing the
adults with an impromptu piano recital.

749
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,996
I didn't even masturbate
until after I had sex.

750
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:14,355
Are you kidding?
I started when I was four.

751
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:15,475
- Four?
- Four?

752
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:17,994
My babysitter caught me
humping my <i>Mother Goose</i> book.

753
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,273
I've never found a dick
as hard as that book.

754
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,951
Hey, I never masturbated until I read
that book, <i>Our Bodies, Ourselves.</i>

755
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:27,553
- Oh, I read that.
- I read that.

756
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:29,870
I had to get out a mirror
and find my clitoris and everything!

757
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:31,359
Did you really do that?

758
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:32,668
I couldn't find it.

759
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:35,558
- Is it clitoris or is it clitoris?
- Clitoris.

760
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:36,914
Wanna know something else?

761
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,594
I don't think I've ever had an orgasm
during sex.

762
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:40,795
- Really?
- What!

763
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,598
I don't think so.

764
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:45,752
You know, I bet those systems analysts
are talking about sex right now.

765
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:49,396
What's the least amount of money
you would stick your hand in a toilet for?

766
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:52,870
That depends! We talking about
my toilet or somebody else's toilet?

767
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:54,871
Yeah, and is it clean
or does it have turds floating in it?

768
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:58,236
We're talking about a clean public toilet.
Would you go after a quarter?

769
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:00,959
- No, I wouldn't go after a quarter.
- Would you go after $5?

770
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,439
- No.
- I'd go after $5.

771
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:03,919
- How about $10?
- No.

772
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,797
How about $20?

773
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:06,949
Yes.

774
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:09,600
I don't really like vibrators.
They make me feel awkward.

775
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,193
Yeah, I've never owned a vibrator.

776
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,157
Did you know that Mom sent me one
when I was at UCLA

777
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:14,229
and Tom dumped me?

778
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:16,231
Mother sent you a vibrator?

779
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:18,914
She wanted me to be satisfied
but not sleep around.

780
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,719
My gosh! My mom
would never send me a vibrator.

781
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,313
Oh, she'd just gotten divorced.

782
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,595
She was going through her...

783
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,357
She never sent me a vibrator.

784
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:30,317
I believe you were too busy
comforting Daddy

785
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:31,913
and not speaking to her at the time.

786
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,638
Well, somebody had to.
He was devastated.

787
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:35,199
Oh, thank God
his favourite daughter was around.

788
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,838
Oh, let's please not start that.

789
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:38,069
You know what?

790
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,151
I used to have this little pillow
when I was little

791
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:41,434
with a little happy face on it

792
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:44,557
and I used to make out with it
and pretend it was David Cassidy.

793
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,949
- You were obsessed with him!
- We all were.

794
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:50,830
You know, I had the most erotic dream
about him once.

795
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:52,712
I did. I know it doesn't sound like much,

796
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:56,429
but it's probably
the sexiest dream I ever had.

797
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:58,468
So? Come on.

798
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:00,039
Well...

799
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:05,035
He's at the top
of this really long flight of stairs.

800
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:08,039
And I felt like I had to climb forever.

801
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:13,310
And then when I got there,
he was wearing these leather pants

802
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:14,799
and his

803
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,677
thing was out.

804
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:21,437
It was really big.

805
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:25,151
How big was it?

806
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:29,639
What?

807
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:32,399
What?

808
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:35,798
It's hard to explain
but it was really erotic.

809
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:39,998
I had this dream that I had sex
with Andy Rooney in a bathtub!

810
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,278
- Oh!
- Disgusting.

811
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,470
You know what I loved
about David Cassidy?

812
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:46,437
He had no visible body hair.

813
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:47,919
You know,
I remember thinking when I was little

814
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,197
that I'd never like one of those
big furry grown-ups like my father.

815
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,748
- Like your husband, you mean.
- I was just about to say that.

816
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:55,239
Hey! Shut up!

817
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:58,039
- At least he's not bald.
- Hey, come on, Jerry's not bald.

818
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:00,793
- His hairline's very distinctive.
- Oh, God, she's defending him.

819
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,393
He's not bald!

820
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:04,915
All right, wait,
I was gonna say something.

821
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,037
Oh, yes. Please say something.
You've been so quiet all evening.

822
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:09,634
God.

823
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,956
You know, there are some hairy men
that I find attractive.

824
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:13,632
How about Sonny in <i>The Godfather?</i>

825
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:15,790
Oh, yes, up against the door, page 27.

826
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:17,472
- 26.
- No, 27.

827
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:20,711
I used to read it on the phone
to Brad Fertini in junior high school.

828
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,268
- Oh, I remember him!
- He made me, over and over again.

829
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:25,316
He had bad skin, right?

830
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,752
You know, there's something
about those gangsters

831
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:31,239
that was such a turn-on.

832
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:33,197
That was
my biggest masturbation fantasy

833
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,032
when I was in high school.

834
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:45,879
<i>I picture that den in</i> The Godfather
<i>with all those men in it.</i>

835
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:50,075
<i>I've cheated on the Don's son</i>
<i>and the family finds out.</i>

836
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:52,670
<i>So they bring me into the room</i>

837
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:56,548
<i>and the Don decides</i>
<i>I must be punished.</i>

838
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:03,038
<i>Sometimes he rubs an ice cube</i>
<i>on my butt because it's so sore.</i>

839
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:06,033
Gee, thanks for sharing.

840
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:09,751
I can't believe
you just told that to everybody.

841
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:12,631
What do you mean everybody?

842
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:14,756
Jeez, I've known you guys
practically my whole life.

843
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:17,479
I can't share one little sex fantasy?

844
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:20,679
You know, that is why
we are so messed up.

845
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:22,637
Because we're too ashamed
to reveal ourselves.

846
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:26,269
That's why my fantasy is about
being punished, because I'm ashamed.

847
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:27,839
Don't you get it?

848
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,831
I mean, we're women,
so we're supposed to be pure.

849
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:31,273
- We're not supposed to have fantasies.
- Calm down.

850
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:32,475
Calm down. Calm down!

851
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:33,709
We're supposed to be
up on this pedestal.

852
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:36,394
Calm down. I'm glad that you told it.

853
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:40,549
Yes, it's very reassuring to know
that there's someone else

854
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,870
who is a little bit
more of a pervert than I am.

855
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:44,473
I am not a pervert!

856
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:48,030
Okay, okay, okay. I'm kidding.
I'm kidding. I'm kidding. All right?

857
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:50,037
- Men like to be spanked, too.
- That's right.

858
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:53,157
I mean, it's that whole dominatrix thing.
It's very, very common.

859
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:54,309
Maybe in England.

860
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:57,710
But I don't like being the spanker.
I only like to be the spankee.

861
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:00,189
- I like getting a spanking.
- Why?

862
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:02,475
It's fun. Me and Jamie do it all the time.

863
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:05,233
I don't want to get spanked. It hurts.

864
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:08,511
- Your parents spank you?
- Yeah, my dad does.

865
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:12,909
- You wanna see something?
- Okay.

866
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:18,272
Where'd you get this?

867
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:20,590
It was in your dad's bedroom,
in the cupboard.

868
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:23,399
Jill, put it back.
We're gonna get in trouble.

869
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:26,552
- Why?
- 'Cause those magazines are for men.

870
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:28,388
So?

871
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:36,112
- Look at her boobies.
- They're gross.

872
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:38,671
Men like them like that.

873
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:59,350
Where did you get this magazine?

874
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:01,749
- It was in your husband's bathroom.
- What?

875
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:05,032
- I was looking for toilet...
- Jill, you go home.

876
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:06,189
Git!

877
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:10,592
And you, young lady, can stay in
your room until your father gets home.

878
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:12,159
God!

879
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:17,508
Bend over and pull down your pants.

880
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:21,038
Do you think people
have spanking fantasies

881
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:23,588
in countries
that don't use corporal punishment?

882
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,830
I have a domination fantasy.

883
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,153
Do tell.

884
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:31,029
I make my cretin supervisor
clean the bathroom.

885
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:36,349
Rachel, that's an intellectual fantasy,
not a sexual one.

886
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:38,748
Well...

887
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,274
I guess.

888
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:46,313
My therapist says that
acting out some fantasies

889
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,311
with a partner you trust
is actually quite healthy.

890
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,960
- As long as nobody gets hurt.
- Right.

891
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:53,710
You know,
Randy likes playing those games.

892
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:55,597
Really? What does he do, paint you?

893
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:59,195
No. No, he's an actor,

894
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:02,670
so he likes to get into character
and pretend we're different people.

895
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:05,634
One time, he played doctor,

896
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:08,633
and he shaved off all my pubic hair.

897
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:10,959
It was really erotic at the time,

898
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,508
but now it's growing back in
and it's really itchy.

899
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:17,388
I let this guy do it to me once and
I forgot and I went to get a Pap smear.

900
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:19,517
It was so embarrassing!

901
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:21,796
I didn't know anything embarrassed you.

902
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:24,519
- I had a crush on my gynaecologist.
- Oh, that's gross.

903
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:28,752
Can we please talk about something
other than sex for five minutes?

904
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:34,837
Okay, fine. Let's talk about sex.

905
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:36,911
What is wrong with talking about sex?

906
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,560
- Don't you think about sex?
- Of course, I do.

907
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:41,392
So, what turns you on?

908
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:43,550
Right. You'll just make fun of me.

909
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:45,312
No, I really wanna know. I won't.

910
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:47,231
Well, I don't have anything
that compares to yours.

911
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:50,517
- Oh, come on. Rachel, spill it.
- Rachel, come on.

912
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:53,233
All right.

913
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,193
Don't laugh.

914
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:59,429
But it has to do with shopping.

915
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:02,874
I admit I'm a bit of a materialist!

916
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:08,390
Anyway, this man takes me
to a really expensive store,

917
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:11,836
and he picks clothes out for me.

918
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:17,628
He is completely in control.

919
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:19,833
And he decides everything,

920
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:22,798
right down to the Christian Dior teddy.

921
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:27,075
And then he

922
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:31,790
makes me model everything.

923
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:40,833
That's it?

924
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:43,674
That...

925
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,311
You masturbate to that?

926
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:47,549
I didn't say that.

927
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:50,074
I'm just trying to figure out
at what point do you come?

928
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:52,196
When the clerk says,

929
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:55,556
"That'll be $2,750"?

930
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:02,070
Will you stop making...
See, I can't tell anything in front of Jill.

931
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:06,997
I'm sorry. I'm just trying to figure out
how we turned out so different.

932
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:09,355
No, really. Seriously, Rachel, I mean.

933
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:11,829
Do you really think
that's a masturbation fantasy?

934
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:13,478
I never said that.

935
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:15,676
What, you don't masturbate?

936
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,716
Well, as a matter of fact, I don't.

937
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:20,233
- Really?
- Never?

938
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:21,958
What's the big deal?
I just never wanted to.

939
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:25,191
I just don't like touching myself there.

940
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,319
How can we be sisters?

941
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:29,595
You know,
my mother doesn't masturbate.

942
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:31,955
- How do you know?
- We tell each other everything.

943
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:35,510
I mean, she has no sex life,
not since my parents got divorced.

944
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:38,433
- And she doesn't masturbate.
- That's a generational thing.

945
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:41,796
- I think that's sad.
- I think a lot of women are like that.

946
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:44,110
You know,
my mother never talks about sex.

947
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:47,556
But she did tell me once that
she thinks that oral sex is disgusting.

948
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:51,758
- Oh, I had my first orgasm with oral sex.
- Me, too, after the prom.

949
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:54,070
You know, I think I was allergic
to Mark's sperm.

950
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:56,151
When it got on my face,
it gave me a rash.

951
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:58,879
I kind of enjoyed giving head to men.

952
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:01,674
- So which is better?
- Men or women?

953
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:08,199
I don't know. They're very different.

954
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:11,274
I really enjoyed having sex with men,
but I...

955
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:14,717
I would have to say
that I prefer sex with women. It's...

956
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:17,115
Women are great. I think
they're great in every way, you know.

957
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:21,159
Sexually and emotionally
I feel more of a bond with women. I do.

958
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:24,715
I mean, sex is sex,

959
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:28,349
but I guess when it's all over
I would rather hang out with a woman.

960
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:32,798
You know, I think I like hanging out
with you guys

961
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:35,269
better than any guy I've ever dated.

962
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:36,475
Yeah.

963
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:45,756
- I need some sugar.
- I should check my machine.

964
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:46,795
More chocolate.

965
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:51,275
- Oh, my God, Randy called.
- So?

966
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:54,911
- He's furious.
- Well, don't let him intimidate you.

967
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,595
Could you grab the napkins
and the ice cream, please?

968
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:01,240
- I'll just get this out of the way.
- That is so beautiful.

969
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:03,754
- Did Chris make that?
- Yep.

970
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:05,712
She is so talented.

971
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:09,396
Jerome loves carrot cake.

972
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:11,838
Oh, screw him.

973
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:14,275
You're not really
gonna cancel your wedding, are you?

974
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:15,759
Ice cream's melting.

975
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:19,191
Jesus, Marcy.

976
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:22,399
He said on my machine
he was gonna call me here.

977
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:24,869
- It's not Randy.
- That's creepy.

978
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:27,269
Maybe we should call the police.

979
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:28,588
Hello?

980
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:31,796
- No, Randy, she's not here.
- Oh, my gosh.

981
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:35,474
Well, I don't care
if you did see her car in the driveway.

982
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:37,152
Look, if you show your face
on my property,

983
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:41,438
I'll have you arrested so fast
that your head will spin. Now, goodbye.

984
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:44,034
- Slumber party massacre.
- What're we gonna do?

985
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:46,315
No, nothing. He's all bark, honey.

986
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:49,073
You don't understand. He... He... He...

987
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:51,720
- What?
- He threatened to blackmail me.

988
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:53,358
- About what?
- What?

989
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:55,556
You guys, I did something so stupid.

990
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:58,313
- What? What is it?
- Marcy, what?

991
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:01,590
I can't tell you. It's too embarrassing.

992
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:04,353
- Come on, you gotta be kidding.
- Marcy.

993
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:07,592
It was so stupid. It was just so stupid.

994
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:09,629
What?

995
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:12,475
I let him take pictures of me.

996
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:14,916
Really explicit pictures.

997
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:17,600
- Oh, Marcy.
- That was not a good idea.

998
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:19,432
Oh, thanks, Mom.

999
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:22,791
He threatened to mail them
to my parents!

1000
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:25,750
I am the stupidest person
that ever lived.

1001
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:27,910
How could I have ever liked him?
What's wrong with me?

1002
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,515
My parents would have a heart attack
if they even knew I was seeing him.

1003
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:33,591
How could you go
from a nice, normal attorney

1004
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:34,874
to a psychotic house painter?

1005
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:38,475
- Oh, Mark was a scumbag.
- Oh, God, I know.

1006
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:41,430
I can't believe I wasted six years on him.

1007
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:43,397
What did poor Mark do?

1008
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:46,230
Oh, it's so unsavoury.

1009
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:50,599
You know, after all those years

1010
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:55,231
of refusing to really commit to our
relationship but still stringing me along,

1011
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:59,433
I found out something really awful
about him.

1012
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:00,993
- What?
- What?

1013
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:06,476
Oh, he was getting hand jobs
at a massage parlour in Van Nuys.

1014
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:08,198
Are you serious?

1015
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:12,229
Yeah, he said it helped him relax
after his racquetball games.

1016
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:14,788
That's awful. How did you find out?

1017
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:16,632
When I was doing his taxes.

1018
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:18,915
He saved the receipts
to write off as a business expense.

1019
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,672
What a scum!

1020
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:23,157
That's not deductible.

1021
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:26,312
- I never liked him.
- My parents were in love with him.

1022
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:28,311
Oh, forget about your parents
for God's sakes.

1023
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:32,313
You know, that is your problem.
You've been a good girl your whole life.

1024
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:34,557
I guess that's true.

1025
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:44,476
<i>When I was a little girl,</i>
<i>we'd go on road trips.</i>

1026
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:48,314
<i>My mother used to always tell me</i>
<i>never to use a rest stop alone,</i>

1027
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:51,870
<i>'cause there might be a rapist in there</i>
<i>waiting for me.</i>

1028
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:05,799
<i>It's so weird but something about</i>
<i>the idea of my very own rapist</i>

1029
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:07,871
<i>used to really excite me.</i>

1030
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:13,596
<i>Sometimes I'd imagine myself,</i>
<i>all grown up and travelling alone.</i>

1031
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:18,353
<i>And I had to pee so bad</i>
<i>I just couldn't help it.</i>

1032
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:36,074
I've been waiting for you, darling.

1033
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:38,552
Isn't that awful?

1034
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:41,754
I didn't even know what a rapist was.

1035
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:46,038
He just kissed me and then asked
if he could watch me pee.

1036
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:50,748
Did you know that on my soap,
the rapist got the most fan mail

1037
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:52,389
from women?

1038
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:56,951
Well, look at Luke on <i>General Hospital.</i>
Laura married him after he raped her.

1039
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:58,996
Yeah, and then
he became the biggest deal.

1040
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:00,069
That's weird.

1041
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:02,116
You know what really bugs me
is in the movies,

1042
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:05,749
you always see little boys jerking off
to dirty postcards and everything,

1043
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:09,071
but you never see
any little girls have any sexuality at all.

1044
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:13,119
- That would scare people.
- It's just like that whole stripper thing.

1045
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:16,831
I mean, I really thought
that Jerry was evolved,

1046
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:19,554
but he is out there, as we speak,

1047
01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:22,598
oogling some unemployed actress
in a dirty thong.

1048
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:25,513
- Ogling.
- How did we get back on this subject?

1049
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:29,149
You guys, should I call over there
and see if she's been there yet?

1050
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:30,514
- Yes.
- No.

1051
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:32,119
I'm going to.

1052
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:38,792
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God!

1053
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:40,438
- The bridesmaid's dress.
- That is hideous.

1054
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:42,033
How did we ever go out in public
in that?

1055
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:44,793
- Where did you find it?
- Mothball section.

1056
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:01,672
You guys been talking about sex
all evening?

1057
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:06,876
I kept hearing
little snatches of your conversation.

1058
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,911
No pun intended.

1059
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:12,274
It was giving me the wildest dreams.

1060
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:14,308
Oh, hello.

1061
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:17,949
I sent one of my girls over this evening
to do a strip for a few gentlemen.

1062
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:20,600
I just wanted to know
if she arrived there okay.

1063
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:23,158
I think I see her.

1064
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:24,749
Cute.

1065
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:29,989
Chris, your cake is fabulous.
I can't stop eating it.

1066
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:33,152
Well, that's it.
The wedding's off, and I mean it.

1067
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:35,035
What was that?

1068
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:43,153
Oh, my God, it's Randy's El Camino.
He's here.

1069
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:45,159
He's here.

1070
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:47,795
- I said he's here! What're we gonna do?
- Call the police.

1071
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:48,915
Who is it?

1072
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,718
That bozo
who wanted to paint the house.

1073
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:52,313
He wants to paint the house
at this hour?

1074
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:53,719
No, he's been stalking Marcy.

1075
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:57,190
- Whoever he is, he's in the backyard.
- That little fucker! I'm gonna get him.

1076
01:04:57,280 --> 01:04:59,191
- Oh, my God.
- Chris, no!

1077
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:00,793
I got pepper spray!

1078
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:04,195
You're dead!

1079
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:07,832
Chris, oh, my God, that's the pool man.

1080
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:09,751
- Jesus!
- Are you okay?

1081
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:10,829
That's not Randy.

1082
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:14,035
Here, why don't you
have some carrot cake?

1083
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:16,429
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1084
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:18,711
- Here, Chris baked it.
- This is my favourite.

1085
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:20,753
- It's delicious.
- I'm sorry.

1086
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:23,559
- We thought you were someone else.
- Who, the bogeyman?

1087
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:27,155
- No, a friend of Marcy's.
- He's not really a friend of mine.

1088
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:30,118
- He's actually my house painter.
- Oh, you naughty girl.

1089
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:33,397
You wanna see a picture of him?
I just happen to have one handy.

1090
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:35,716
So, now he's basically stalking me.

1091
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:38,956
He's cute.

1092
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:41,031
- Who is it?
- Oh, God, he's here.

1093
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:42,712
Jesus, I'll get it.

1094
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:45,155
I'd better handle this. She'll kill him.

1095
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:49,837
May I help you?

1096
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:52,913
- Who the hell are you?
- Mr French.

1097
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:53,989
Where's Marcy?

1098
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:56,514
She's taking a long hot soak in the tub,

1099
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:59,273
and she's not receiving
any gentleman callers.

1100
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:01,078
What are you, some kind of a fag?

1101
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:04,000
Tell Marcy
to get her butt out here right now.

1102
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:06,071
Listen, you little soap opera reject,

1103
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:08,720
if you come near that woman again

1104
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:11,758
I'm gonna smash your
pretty little face in. Do you understand?

1105
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:14,149
Right, just let me go, all right?

1106
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:15,549
Slut.

1107
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:22,356
And I really loved her.

1108
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:25,639
Marcy!

1109
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:28,078
Hey, Marcy!

1110
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:31,150
Oh, God, he's a method actor.

1111
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:32,879
Marcy!

1112
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:35,152
- Marcy!
- Don't!

1113
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:36,839
He is cute.

1114
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:38,789
Randy.

1115
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:44,679
What's your problem?
You won't even take my calls. Why?

1116
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:47,031
What, all of a sudden
I have cooties now?

1117
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:50,237
No. No. No. It's just that I...

1118
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:53,949
I told you once already how I feel
and it's kind of hard for me to...

1119
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:55,632
Blow people off?

1120
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:58,469
Look, Randy, I don't know
why you're so upset.

1121
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:02,473
I didn't sense that much of
an emotional involvement from you.

1122
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:03,788
Really?

1123
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:06,834
Well, you haven't been paying
much attention then, have you?

1124
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:10,515
So, what, ultimately, I'm just
not good enough for you, is that it?

1125
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:14,435
You know what? You don't really want to
be involved with me. I'm really a mess.

1126
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:16,511
Christ, I hate that old line.

1127
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:18,989
You don't wanna be involved with me
because your parents would shit

1128
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:22,595
if they knew their little princess
was boning a house painter.

1129
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:25,191
Well, you might not think
I have any potential,

1130
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:26,759
but you're gonna feel pretty stupid

1131
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:29,593
when I become famous and you see
you're gonna miss out big time.

1132
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:31,318
I'm sure I will.

1133
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:34,275
- Yeah, right.
- No, I'm...

1134
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:40,517
Randy, I'm really sorry you're upset.
I didn't mean to hurt you.

1135
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:41,999
You used me.

1136
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:43,399
You just wanted to sleep with me

1137
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:45,232
like I was some kind of a bimbo
or something.

1138
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:46,992
No. No, I...

1139
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:50,398
I just thought we were having fun.

1140
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:52,351
Yeah, well, whatever.

1141
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:55,031
You have a nice life.

1142
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:57,558
Oh, you, too.

1143
01:07:57,640 --> 01:08:00,074
And good luck with your career.

1144
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:03,357
I'll look forward
to seeing you on the big screen.

1145
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:10,518
Can I have
a goodbye kiss or something?

1146
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:12,472
Of course.

1147
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:20,153
Who's that?

1148
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:22,513
Brandy.

1149
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:27,238
Well, take care.

1150
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:30,031
Yeah, you, too, babe.

1151
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:48,596
Now, let me get this straight,
sweetheart.

1152
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:50,716
- You're dumping this gorgeous...
- Easy on the tequila, Marcy.

1153
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:53,473
...very intelligent-looking man,

1154
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:56,711
because his horny little friend
hired a stripper?

1155
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:59,519
I just don't feel like
making myself vulnerable

1156
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:00,874
to getting trashed again.

1157
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:03,155
Why'd you get involved with him
in the first place?

1158
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:07,358
Well, I keep thinking that I'll change,
that I'll get more secure.

1159
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:12,430
It's so hard to risk
getting intimate time and time again.

1160
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:16,914
Taking my clothes off
in front of somebody for the first time.

1161
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:19,551
Explaining my breast implants.

1162
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:22,438
- Those aren't real?
- No, unfortunately.

1163
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:26,078
You know,
sometimes I imagine my coffin.

1164
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:31,275
When the rest of me is decomposed,
there's these two little bags of silicone.

1165
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:35,712
I mean, they're just sitting there
in that pine box.

1166
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:37,313
- Oh, Jesus.
- Oh, Jesus.

1167
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:41,279
You have every reason to be happy
right now and listen to you.

1168
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:44,234
Do you think maybe
you're just not in love with Jerry?

1169
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:46,629
He's the best guy I've ever been with!

1170
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:51,635
I'd give anything in the world if I could
find a nice Jewish boy and settle down.

1171
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:54,637
He's so cute

1172
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:57,314
- with those round little glasses.
- Oh, God!

1173
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:01,359
- You're so funny.
- Marcy.

1174
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,798
It's been fun, girls. We must do it again.

1175
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:07,439
He's so funny.

1176
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:11,195
- You're drunk, girlfriend.
- Oh, no, I'm just relaxed.

1177
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:15,879
Jamie, you marry that boy.
He sounds like heaven on a stick.

1178
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:17,959
- Bye-bye.
- Take care.

1179
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:19,268
Night.

1180
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:25,513
Jill, that's Tina's blanket.

1181
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:27,318
So? It's cosy.

1182
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:28,833
That's gross.

1183
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:33,557
Let's stick her hand in my ginger ale
and see if she pees.

1184
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:40,709
Oh, she looks like a little child,
doesn't she?

1185
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:44,397
Oh, lucky her to be so innocent!

1186
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:46,596
- Marcy.
- Oh, God.

1187
01:10:46,680 --> 01:10:48,591
Give me that. Give it to me.

1188
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:50,318
I'm so tired.

1189
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:52,073
It's late.

1190
01:10:52,760 --> 01:10:54,796
It's time to hit the hay.

1191
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:58,713
I can't believe he hasn't even called.

1192
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,150
I didn't get any message
about a cancellation.

1193
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:06,471
I'm sorry. We left it on your service.

1194
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:08,755
I drove here
all the way from Simi Valley.

1195
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:11,756
What, you guys
don't like the way I look?

1196
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:13,671
No, no, no. No way.

1197
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:15,991
You're terrific.

1198
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:19,433
He just
doesn't want to upset his fiance.

1199
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:22,790
- Hey!
- Turn it off.

1200
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:25,839
- It's the new direct digital sound.
- Look,

1201
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:31,351
I'm sorry about the confusion.
Personally, I'd still like to see the show.

1202
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:34,838
Well, then, when you get married,
why don't you give me a call?

1203
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:38,635
Who is this? It's 3:00 a.m.

1204
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:43,400
Hello? Hi, Jerry.

1205
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:48,310
Yeah, hang on a second.

1206
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:56,869
- Jamie, Jerry's on the phone.
- Tell him I hate him.

1207
01:11:56,960 --> 01:11:58,359
Jamie.

1208
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:09,752
Your bathroom mirrors
are making me suicidal.

1209
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:11,709
Hello?

1210
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:13,358
Hey, you guys, listen,

1211
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:15,954
I didn't want to tell you this before
because I was too embarrassed

1212
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:17,598
- but you know what I did once?
- I'm allergic to down.

1213
01:12:17,680 --> 01:12:19,432
There are other blankets, Rachel.

1214
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:20,589
You want me to get you another one?

1215
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:23,474
What? You did?

1216
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:26,351
Of course I believe you.

1217
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:30,918
Oh, Jerry, do you really love me?
You do? I'm so sorry.

1218
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,116
No, I am. I am sorry.

1219
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:36,397
Of course, I still wanna marry you.
Don't be ridiculous.

1220
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:38,232
It's just that...

1221
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:42,675
Here's another comforter.

1222
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:44,512
- It's not down.
- So, you guys, listen,

1223
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:48,839
when I was about 12,
when I was first growing pubic hair,

1224
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:53,829
I got out of the shower and it was all wet
and dripping, you know.

1225
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:57,518
Honey, can you talk up? I can't hear.

1226
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:59,955
And Tuffy, our dog,

1227
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:03,237
started licking it because he was thirsty,

1228
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:06,112
and I just let him.

1229
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:10,995
Right on.

1230
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:13,469
Well, we're all just sharing
our sex stories.

1231
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:16,028
Oh, honey, I love you so much. I do.

1232
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:19,590
I wish that I could come home right now
and hop into bed with you.

1233
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:23,959
This whole sort of slumber party's
been fun but it's really exhausting.

1234
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:28,558
And Rachel and Jill, they have been
going at it all night, as usual.

1235
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:33,279
Oh, I can't sleep without you,
bunny face.

1236
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:34,634
Bunny face.

1237
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:36,995
Bye.

1238
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:44,750
He cancelled the stripper.

1239
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:46,913
Good, bunny face.

1240
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,514
Were you eavesdropping
on that whole conversation?

1241
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:52,876
As a matter of fact,
I'm going to use the bathroom.

1242
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:58,158
No, Marcy, no!
I haven't got the plug in yet.

1243
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:00,992
Marcy, no. Cut it out.

1244
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:02,308
I don't feel well.

1245
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:03,753
Dibs on the sofa.

1246
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:05,558
You always do that.
Why should you get the sofa?

1247
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:08,279
- Motherhood takes precedence.
- Not if she isn't pregnant.

1248
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:09,873
She is pregnant.

1249
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:20,116
I'm sorry. I'm tired, Jill. I totally spaced.

1250
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:21,474
She hates me.

1251
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:24,030
The wedding's back on.

1252
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:31,232
He's such a good guy.

1253
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:35,518
Even if he does only have one testicle,
he's a hell of a guy!

1254
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:37,916
You are too much.

1255
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:41,040
Great. Now everyone hates me.

1256
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:44,072
I wonder why.

1257
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:46,318
I don't feel very good.

1258
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:48,231
I think I need some fresh air.

1259
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:56,999
Rachel. Please come out.

1260
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:01,718
She's hardly told anyone.
Rachel, come on.

1261
01:15:02,120 --> 01:15:03,758
Leave me alone.

1262
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:06,600
Rachel, let me in.

1263
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:13,039
Chris.

1264
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:14,508
Jesus, man, what'd I do now?

1265
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:17,751
Nothing. I'm trying to get Rachel
out of the bathroom. She's upset.

1266
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:19,159
Right.

1267
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:22,152
I'll see you in bed.

1268
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:24,390
- I'm sleeping in the living room.
- What?

1269
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:27,756
I'm the hostess for Christ's sake.
It's a slumber party.

1270
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:31,389
- Why don't you just grow up?
- No, why don't you grow up?

1271
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:34,394
Stop being so fucking possessive.

1272
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:37,758
If you don't like it here, why don't you
just go live someplace else?

1273
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:39,193
Fine.

1274
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:43,629
Shit.

1275
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:45,153
Rachel.

1276
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:47,674
Open the fucking door. Let me in.

1277
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:07,669
- I'm sorry I opened my big mouth.
- No, it's not your fault.

1278
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:13,670
She always finds some way to
hurt me or exclude me

1279
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:15,637
ever since we were born.

1280
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:17,153
I mean, I'm her sister, for God's sake!

1281
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:19,037
Why wouldn't she tell me
something that important?

1282
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:20,155
Because she's confused.

1283
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:22,037
She doesn't even know
what she's gonna do yet.

1284
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:23,792
What do you mean,
what she's gonna do?

1285
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:26,314
Well, she just got Noah
ready for preschool

1286
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:29,790
and she wants to go back
to school herself, you know that.

1287
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:33,075
She's not thinking of having an abortion.

1288
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:34,593
Well, I don't know what she's thinking.

1289
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:37,353
You know,
she hasn't even talked to Don yet.

1290
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:41,118
She is so selfish

1291
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:43,590
to even consider that!

1292
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:45,273
Just for her own convenience?

1293
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:47,396
You know,
that's why she didn't want to tell you.

1294
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:50,711
I'm sorry. I can't understand
how anybody can do that.

1295
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:53,359
You don't know
what it's like to be my age

1296
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:56,079
and just watch your eggs
just walking away from you.

1297
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:02,954
I want a baby more than anything.

1298
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:05,794
Honey.

1299
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:08,114
Okay.

1300
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:11,953
But Jill's life is still her decision.

1301
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:16,511
What makes you think
I don't understand, huh?

1302
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:18,716
I want to have a baby, too.

1303
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:20,678
How could you? I mean...

1304
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:22,671
Rachel, give me a break.

1305
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:26,230
I mean, haven't you ever heard
of a turkey baster for God's sake?

1306
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:29,717
How does Chris feel?

1307
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:31,392
Who knows?

1308
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:33,790
I don't know how I feel
about Chris right now.

1309
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:36,917
- I'm very confused about all that.
- About what?

1310
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:41,549
Everything. I just don't know
what I really want right now.

1311
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:47,151
You know,
there's this guy at work that I really like.

1312
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:49,469
Really?

1313
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:52,393
Yeah. And I find myself
thinking all kinds of stupid things.

1314
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:56,678
You know, like how much easier my life
would be if I were straight, you know?

1315
01:17:56,760 --> 01:18:00,230
- How happy my mother would be.
- Oh, your mother.

1316
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:03,794
She wasn't exactly a model mother.

1317
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:06,269
Why do you care what she thinks?

1318
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:08,112
- Yeah, well...
- I'm sorry.

1319
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:09,792
It's okay.

1320
01:18:10,280 --> 01:18:13,477
It's just as well
I was here with my grandmother.

1321
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:14,669
But, I mean, you know,

1322
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:18,275
I might like to get married someday
and have kids.

1323
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:22,919
I don't know.

1324
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:27,755
Shit. I am just too old
to be this mixed up.

1325
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:31,871
You poor thing.

1326
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:38,428
I always think of you as
so calm and capable.

1327
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:44,431
I always forget
that you could have problems, too.

1328
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:46,079
I'm okay.

1329
01:18:53,240 --> 01:18:56,357
Let's go back in
and join the party, okay?

1330
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:58,516
Come on. Come on.

1331
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:02,159
Come on.

1332
01:19:02,440 --> 01:19:03,919
Okay.

1333
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:19,228
I always wanted to be a ballerina.

1334
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:23,469
I studied for 10 years.

1335
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:26,599
Now I'm just a CPA with duck feet.

1336
01:19:29,480 --> 01:19:31,436
You got nice posture.

1337
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:32,993
Thanks.

1338
01:19:34,160 --> 01:19:37,630
That's why my mother
wanted me to study it in the first place.

1339
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:41,758
My mom, she tried
to get me to take dance.

1340
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:43,796
I took bowling instead.

1341
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:47,390
Wow. So you knew pretty young.

1342
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:52,876
Well, you know, I mean that...

1343
01:19:55,560 --> 01:19:59,075
You know, Georgina was always
just like the rest of us.

1344
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:02,517
Yeah. I know.
I know what you mean, you know.

1345
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:04,955
She's bi, and I'm a dyke.

1346
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:09,394
I knew I was gay when I was five.

1347
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:13,435
I had this really big crush on
Barbara Eden from <i>I Dream of Jeannie.</i>

1348
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:16,671
I love that show! Oh, I love that show!

1349
01:20:16,760 --> 01:20:19,149
I used to have this little Jeannie outfit.

1350
01:20:19,240 --> 01:20:21,549
I wanted to look just like her.

1351
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:25,277
I wanted to marry her.

1352
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:27,717
Is Barbara Eden gay?

1353
01:20:29,240 --> 01:20:32,038
I don't know.
She's not really my type any more.

1354
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:33,917
Oh. Yeah.

1355
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:37,475
She hasn't done much lately.

1356
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:40,393
Anyway.

1357
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:43,714
Wow.

1358
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:47,759
Do you know,
sometimes I've wished I was gay.

1359
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:51,558
It seems like
it would be so much easier.

1360
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:53,435
Why?

1361
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,479
I don't know.

1362
01:20:56,160 --> 01:20:58,720
Because then
you wouldn't have to deal with men.

1363
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:01,268
Women are so much easier
to get along with.

1364
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:03,669
They're so much more diplomatic.

1365
01:21:06,760 --> 01:21:08,512
I've noticed.

1366
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:12,750
I know, but they really love each other.

1367
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,513
It's pretty much the same
when you're gay, you know?

1368
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:18,637
You get in the same fights,
the same jealousy and stuff.

1369
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:21,354
It's just less socially acceptable.

1370
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:24,950
Hey, I have a gay third cousin in Seattle.

1371
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:27,873
She married her lover in a big wedding.

1372
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,309
They even registered for china.

1373
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:33,638
My mom bought them
a whole place setting.

1374
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:37,438
She's very impressed
with their families.

1375
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:43,356
You seem really sad.

1376
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:51,308
I think Georgina wants to break up.

1377
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:58,149
You know, I've always envied you.

1378
01:21:58,240 --> 01:22:00,196
You have the perfect husband,
the perfect kid.

1379
01:22:00,280 --> 01:22:02,236
- What do I look like, Mrs Beaver?
- Cleaver.

1380
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:05,073
Don't try to convince her she's happy,
Jamie. She'd rather be tragic.

1381
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:07,355
Oh, listen to Miss Prozac.

1382
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:13,756
Can't you ever keep your mouth shut
about anything?

1383
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,673
I'm just so tired of her moods,
you know.

1384
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:21,917
That's so amazing.
I never knew Georgina had moods.

1385
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:25,080
Well, she's great with her friends.

1386
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:28,557
It's just as a lover, you know, it's like,

1387
01:22:28,640 --> 01:22:31,518
"come here" one minute,
"go away" the next.

1388
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:35,153
Plus, she's so smart, you know.

1389
01:22:36,080 --> 01:22:37,593
And beautiful.

1390
01:22:40,120 --> 01:22:42,395
I mean, you know, I'm...

1391
01:22:42,680 --> 01:22:44,113
I'm a baker.

1392
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:46,794
I'm just a baker, and she's a chef.

1393
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:50,193
I don't know what she saw in me
to begin with.

1394
01:22:50,280 --> 01:22:51,998
Oh, I do.

1395
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:55,393
- I think you're very attractive.
- Please.

1396
01:22:55,480 --> 01:22:57,277
No, I do. I...

1397
01:22:57,720 --> 01:22:59,711
Hey, if I were a woman...

1398
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:03,118
Or a lesbian...

1399
01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:06,157
You know what I mean.

1400
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:11,239
I find you very attractive
because you seem so

1401
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:14,514
comfortable with your sexuality.

1402
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:16,909
You know, Georgina seems more

1403
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:19,319
confused.

1404
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:21,828
Really?

1405
01:23:22,040 --> 01:23:23,393
Oh, yeah.

1406
01:23:24,280 --> 01:23:26,669
Yeah, you have, like,
a self-awareness thing.

1407
01:23:26,760 --> 01:23:28,557
It's very appealing.

1408
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:31,870
I wish I were more like that.

1409
01:23:36,160 --> 01:23:38,958
That's a very nice thing for you to say.

1410
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:05,070
Where the hell is Chris?

1411
01:24:05,160 --> 01:24:06,991
What, you think I'm jealous of you?
Don't flatter yourself.

1412
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:08,559
Stop! Just leave me alone
and stop picking on me.

1413
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:09,914
You have been picking on me all night!

1414
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:11,956
- She's been picking on everybody!
- Oh, fine!

1415
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:14,873
Let's just all gang up on Jill
when I'm pregnant and I don't feel well!

1416
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:17,793
- All right! All right! Walk away, Jill!
- Nobody's ganging up on you.

1417
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:18,949
Yes, you are!

1418
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:20,439
When you want something
you walk away from me.

1419
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:22,476
- You're such a big baby.
- Here you are.

1420
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:24,394
Yeah, what do you care?

1421
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:27,313
You think I'm some spinster and you
have to lie to me so I don't fall apart?

1422
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:28,719
I've been worried
and I've been looking for you.

1423
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:29,994
Well, if the shoe fits, wear it!

1424
01:24:32,920 --> 01:24:36,276
Marcy, for God's sake,
it's 4:00 in the morning. Shut up!

1425
01:24:36,360 --> 01:24:39,193
- Stop telling her what to do.
- Chris, you shut up.

1426
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:41,635
- You shut up.
- Hey, don't tell her to shut up!

1427
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:07,997
- Come on in!
- Come on, get in!

1428
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:18,669
- Chris, come on in.
- Rachel's wearing a bra!

1429
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:22,238
Come on!

1430
01:26:58,120 --> 01:26:59,189
No!

1431
01:30:38,280 --> 01:30:41,272
<i>Now look what you did, you stupid idiot.</i>

1432
01:30:45,240 --> 01:30:47,151
<i>I was talking about four...</i>

1433
01:30:47,240 --> 01:30:48,753
<i>Watch out, Marcy!</i>

1434
01:30:48,840 --> 01:30:51,070
<i>Four, including Jason.</i>

1435
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:56,390
<i>What do you guys think</i>
<i>about Jeff Harland?</i>

1436
01:30:56,480 --> 01:30:58,789
<i>He's cute,</i>
<i>but I think David Cassidy's cuter.</i>

1437
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:01,269
- <i>Oh, I think I'm gonna choke!</i>
- <i>No way.</i>

1438
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:05,110
