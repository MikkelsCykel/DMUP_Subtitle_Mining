01:09:10,300 --> 01:09:11,900
You're new to this. Trust me.

937
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:14,100
It's all about surround sound.

938
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:21,800
[ Woman On TV] I just needed
a little kiss to make me feel better...

939
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:25,300
but now it wasn't working.

940
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:27,600
- Maggie!
- Oh!

941
01:09:28,100 --> 01:09:30,200
We're having Cosmopolitans.
Would you like one?

942
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:33,800
[ Woman On TV] I wasn't getting
the same rush. Tonight, I needed more.

943
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:36,200
No, thanks.

944
01:09:36,700 --> 01:09:39,400
Meanwhile, uptown, Charlotte wondered
when relationships had gotten so complicated.

945
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:43,700
She yearned for the time when dinner
was followed by dessert, not lubricant.

946
01:09:44,700 --> 01:09:46,700
- [ Gags ]
- Ooh, whoops!

947
01:09:47,300 --> 01:09:49,600
[ All Laughing ]

948
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:51,800
[ Ella ]
Oh, my.

949
01:09:52,300 --> 01:09:54,300
I don't want to. Or maybe I do.
I don't know what I want, but-

950
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,700
- I've seen this one.
- [ Charlotte ] I can't.

951
01:09:58,500 --> 01:10:01,000
- I want children and nice bedding and-
- It's funny.

952
01:10:01,700 --> 01:10:05,100
[ Woman ] That night, they made love
the Charlotte way-polite-

953
01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:07,600
[ Mrs. Lefkowitz ]
Oh, it was wonderful.

954
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:09,600
- I thought so.
- Oh, you would.

955
01:10:10,100 --> 01:10:11,700
- Now, walk up straight now.
- Thank you for everything.

956
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:13,700
- Good.
- Have a very wonderful day.

957
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:16,500
- Yes, and have a good sleep, and no sugar.
- Okay. And good night.

958
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:19,200
- Good night.
- Yeah.

959
01:10:19,700 --> 01:10:21,800
[ Chuckling ]
Well-Yeah, okay.

960
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:24,500
Okay. Thank you. Good night.

961
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:41,200
[ Water Running ]

962
01:10:44,100 --> 01:10:46,100
What's up with Lewis?

963
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:49,600
I don't know
what you're talking about.

964
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:52,800
I say go for it. Just jump him.

965
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:55,100
Maggie!

966
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:57,600
Don't talk like that. Here.

967
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:02,800
Half the fun of sex...
is talking about it.

968
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:05,800
Well, I guess I missed that half.

969
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:08,700
You never talked about sex?

970
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:12,400
[ Sighs ]
Occasionally with Ira.

971
01:11:13,300 --> 01:11:14,800
Kind of.

972
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:17,600
Yeah, but what about girlfriends?

973
01:11:18,100 --> 01:11:19,900
The first time you got laid.

974
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:22,000
You had to tell someone that.

975
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:25,400
It was my wedding night.
It was assumed.

976
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,100
You missed out on one of the all-time
greatest conversations in life.

977
01:11:31,100 --> 01:11:32,700
Who'd you tell?

978
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:36,400
Rose.

979
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:38,700
Well, maybe if I'd had a sister.

980
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:41,300
Even when you were so small...

981
01:11:41,900 --> 01:11:43,900
you had a bond
that I'd never had with anyone.

982
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:47,400
You still close like that?

983
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:51,000
Sure.

984
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:53,700
- You don't talk about her.
- What do you want to hear?

985
01:11:56,500 --> 01:11:58,800
We're totally fine. We're-We're tight.
We're thick as thieves.

986
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:02,200
Let's ask her down.
I'd like to know her too.

987
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,400
You know, I doubt she would come.

988
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:08,600
She's, like, really busy.
She's a lawyer.

989
01:12:09,300 --> 01:12:10,600
- No kidding. What kind?
- The really busy kind.

990
01:12:10,900 --> 01:12:12,500
- No kidding. What kind?
- The really busy kind.

991
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:16,300
[ Amy ] What do you do
once they've all peed?

992
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:19,500
[ Rose ] Hmm. Give 'em a brush.
Take 'em all home.

993
01:12:20,300 --> 01:12:22,300
Make sure they have water to drink.

994
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,800
- After that.
- Then I'm done.

995
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:33,000
- So what do you do?
- Whatever.

996
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:37,800
- Shop for food, cook for my boyfriend.
- I know his name.

997
01:12:38,900 --> 01:12:42,100
I know, but I've never really had a real,
live, grown-up boyfriend before...

998
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,400
and I'm gonna use the word
as often as I can.

999
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,300
All right, first of all,
he's not grown up.

1000
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,500
None of them are.

1001
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:54,700
You know, there's a consistency
to your cynicism which is truly beautiful.

1002
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:57,500
Hmm. Just don't be surprised...

1003
01:12:58,100 --> 01:13:00,600
if he turns out to be...
less than perfect.

1004
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:03,300
And don't be surprised if he doesn't.

1005
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:07,900
- I gotta go.
- Good-bye.

1006
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:09,900
- Have fun.
- I'll call you.

1007
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:11,400
All right.

1008
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:15,100
[ Old Man ] You sound too pretty,
Maggie, to be cleaning bedpans.

1009
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:17,900
You're right. I am.

1010
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:21,300
I have a grandson, a doctor over in Tampa.
I should introduce you.

1011
01:13:22,100 --> 01:13:24,600
- [ Chuckles ] You don't want to do that.
- Are you bad news?

1012
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:28,600
[ Sighs ] Well, you know,
I don't mean to be, but yeah.

1013
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:32,300
Well, since you're not gonna
marry my grandson...

1014
01:13:33,100 --> 01:13:34,900
you might as well read to me.

1015
01:13:41,100 --> 01:13:42,800
- I'm kind of a slow reader.
- Perfect.

1016
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:45,600

- Professor.

1021

Retired.
Just take your time, Maggie.

1022
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,500
Listen to the words
as you're about to say them.

1023
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:20,200
Nine times out of 10,

and you'll correct it
before you make it.

a total ass of yourself.

Oh, come on.

1027

[ Sighs ]
Good.

1064
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:22,300
Unacceptable answer.
What's the poem about?

1065
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:26,400
- I don't know.
- Yes, you do. What's it about?

1066
01:17:30,700 --> 01:17:32,200
- Losing?
- What?

1067
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:37,300
- Love?
- Ah.

1068
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:39,700
And how about that?

1069
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:43,600
Is the love lost already?

1070
01:17:44,300 --> 01:17:46,900
Is Bishop writing about it
as a possibility, a probability?

1071
01:17:47,700 --> 01:17:49,200
What?

1072
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:52,700
Well...

1073
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:56,600
in the beginning,
she's talking about...

1074
01:17:57,200 --> 01:18:00,900
losing real things, like keys.

1075
01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:06,400
And then she- she gets, like-

1076
01:18:07,300 --> 01:18:08,800
she lost a continent.

1077
01:18:09,300 --> 01:18:11,700
- She's getting grandiose.
- Yeah.

1078
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:15,500
And the way she says it is like-
like it doesn't matter.

1079
01:18:16,300 --> 01:18:17,900
Ah.

1080
01:18:18,300 --> 01:18:20,700
Her tone-
would you call it detached?

1081
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:25,600
I think she wants
to sound detached.

1082
01:18:26,300 --> 01:18:29,600
You know,
she wants to... sound...

1083
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:32,100
like it doesn't matter...

1084
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:34,700
'cause she knows, deep down...

1085
01:18:35,300 --> 01:18:37,400
how bad it's gonna feel to lose.

1086
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,600
Lose what?

1087
01:18:41,100 --> 01:18:43,000
Or whom?

1088
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:46,400
Is it a lover?

1089
01:18:51,300 --> 01:18:52,800
No.

1090
01:18:58,200 --> 01:18:59,800
It's a friend.

1091
01:19:03,300 --> 01:19:04,900
A-plus.

1092
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:08,800
